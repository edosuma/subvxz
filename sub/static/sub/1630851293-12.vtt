WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:32.433 --> 00:33.666
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

00:33.733 --> 00:34.833
WHICH I'VE NOW BEEN IN SO LONG

00:34.900 --> 00:36.300
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE TO GET IT

00:36.366 --> 00:37.600
WAXED AND BLEACHED AGAIN.

00:37.666 --> 00:39.366
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, FROM A

00:39.433 --> 00:40.400
CYBERATTACK FORCING THE SHUTDOWN

00:40.466 --> 00:41.800
OF A TOP U.S. PIPELINE TO

THE LEAST APPETIZING WAY

00:57.300 --> 00:58.666
IMAGINABLE.

00:58.733 --> 01:00.166
>> JUST THINK OF THIS WHEN YOU

01:00.233 --> 01:02.900
THINK OF VACCINATION...

01:02.966 --> 01:04.166
MMM, VACCINATION...

01:04.233 --> 01:06.633
MMM...

01:06.700 --> 01:08.466

01:10.066 --> 01:10.933
ABOUT VACCINATION RIGHT THIS

01:11.000 --> 01:13.366
MOMENT.

01:13.433 --> 01:18.800
>> John: NOPE.

01:18.866 --> 01:19.600
THAT'S A NO, BILL.

01:19.666 --> 01:20.100
NO TO EVERYTHING THERE.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.333
NO TO THE UNCOMFORTABLY LOUD

01:21.400 --> 01:21.666
CHEWING.

01:21.733 --> 01:22.466
AND DEFINITELY NO TO THE "MMM."

01:22.533 --> 01:23.166
YOU SOUND LIKE A SEXUALLY

01:23.233 --> 01:23.766
FRUSTRATED COW TRYING AND

01:23.833 --> 01:26.266
FAILING TO CLIMAX.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.033
AND LOOK, I'D LOVE TO TALK FOR

01:27.100 --> 01:27.666
THE REST OF THE SHOW ABOUT HOW

01:27.733 --> 01:28.166
TERRIBLE IT IS TO WATCH

01:28.233 --> 01:29.166
BILL de BLASIO EAT A BURGER.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.666
BUT THE THING IS, I CAN'T.

01:31.733 --> 01:32.766
INSTEAD -- IF I MAY QUOTE THE

01:32.833 --> 01:34.066
RISKIEST THING YOU COULD

01:34.133 --> 01:35.633
POSSIBLY SAY ON A FIRST DATE --

01:35.700 --> 01:37.300
"LET'S TALK ABOUT ISRAEL."

01:37.366 --> 01:39.200
BECAUSE THE BIGGEST NEWS OF THE

01:39.266 --> 01:40.866
WEEK HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN THIS.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.333
>> THIS MORNING, THE WORST

01:42.400 --> 01:43.966
VIOLENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN

01:44.033 --> 01:45.700
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS IS

01:45.766 --> 01:47.266
INTENSIFYING.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.100
ISRAEL'S MILITARY ATTACKED NEW

01:49.166 --> 01:50.366
TARGETS IN GAZA, THE PALESTINIAN

01:50.433 --> 01:52.866
TERRITORY WHERE MILITANTS ARE

01:52.933 --> 01:53.833
FIRING HUNDREDS OF ROCKETS INTO

01:53.900 --> 01:54.866
ISRAEL.

01:54.933 --> 01:56.166
AND IN THE ISRAELI-OCCUPIED

01:56.233 --> 01:57.733
WEST BANK, PALESTINIAN

01:57.800 --> 02:00.200
PROTESTERS FOUGHT WITH POLICE.

02:00.266 --> 02:01.566
>> SINCE MONDAY, OVER 80

02:01.633 --> 02:03.133
PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED

02:03.200 --> 02:03.700
AND 7 ISRAELIS IN THIS

02:03.766 --> 02:09.033
TIT-FOR-TAT WAR.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.033
>> John: OKAY, THERE IS A LOT TO

02:10.100 --> 02:11.166
UNPACK THERE, FROM THE HORROR OF

02:11.233 --> 02:11.700
THE SITUATION -- WHICH HAS

02:11.766 --> 02:12.300
ESCALATED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE

02:12.366 --> 02:13.166
THEN -- TO THE USE OF THE PHRASE

02:13.233 --> 02:14.400
"TIT-FOR-TAT WAR" IN A CONFLICT

02:14.466 --> 02:16.100
WHERE YOU JUST POINTED OUT ONE

02:16.166 --> 02:18.266
SIDE HAS SUFFERED OVER TEN TIMES

02:18.333 --> 02:20.566
THE CASUALTIES, SOMETHING WHICH

02:20.633 --> 02:23.866
IMBALANCE AT PLAY HERE AND HOW

02:23.933 --> 02:25.566
THAT OFTEN GETS OBSCURED BY HOW

02:25.633 --> 02:28.466
WE CHOOSE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:28.533 --> 02:29.933
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT FLUENT

02:30.000 --> 02:31.366
IN MIDDLE EAST HISTORY, I KNOW

02:31.433 --> 02:32.400
THIS CAN SEEM OVERWHELMING --

02:32.466 --> 02:33.666
THE LATEST CHAPTER IN A LONG

02:33.733 --> 02:36.166
STORY YOU HAVEN'T READ.

02:36.233 --> 02:37.366
SO I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND

02:37.433 --> 02:38.166
RECAP THE HISTORY HERE, OR

02:38.233 --> 02:39.633
INDEED, PROPOSE A SOLUTION --

02:39.700 --> 02:40.600
ALTHOUGH, INTERESTINGLY, I DO

02:40.666 --> 02:42.500
HAVE ONE.

02:42.566 --> 02:43.400
BECAUSE SOMEONE WITH THIS ACCENT

02:43.466 --> 02:44.366
ALWAYS THINKS THEY CAN FIX

02:44.433 --> 02:48.566
THINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

02:48.633 --> 02:49.233
I REDREW THE MAP A BIT, AND I

02:49.300 --> 02:49.933
HAVE A LOT OF MISPLACED

02:50.000 --> 02:50.900
CONFIDENCE THAT IT WOULD WORK

02:50.966 --> 02:52.233
VERY WELL.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.633
BUT THIS WEEK'S ACTUALLY BEEN A

02:53.700 --> 02:54.933
PRETTY GOOD REMINDER THAT WHILE

02:55.000 --> 02:56.233
SOME THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY

02:56.300 --> 02:57.866
COMPLEX AND REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL

02:57.933 --> 02:59.533
OF CONTEXT, OTHERS ARE JUST

02:59.600 --> 03:01.300
WRONG.

03:01.366 --> 03:02.466
TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, ONE OF THE

03:02.533 --> 03:03.366
INCIDENTS THAT'S BEEN A

03:03.433 --> 03:04.300
FLASHPOINT --

03:04.366 --> 03:05.233
THE PLANNED EXPULSION OF

03:05.300 --> 03:06.700
PALESTINIANS WHO'VE LIVED IN THE

03:06.766 --> 03:09.933
SHEIKH JARRAH NEIGHBORHOOD FOR

03:10.000 --> 03:10.600
GENERATIONS.

03:10.666 --> 03:11.833
IT'S CURRENTLY TIED UP IN THE

03:11.900 --> 03:13.033
ISRAELI COURT SYSTEM WITH THE

03:13.100 --> 03:14.066
FOREIGN MINISTRY CALLING IT A

03:14.133 --> 03:15.233
"REAL ESTATE DISPUTE."

03:15.300 --> 03:16.100
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT THE

03:16.166 --> 03:17.200
U.N.'S COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN

03:17.266 --> 03:18.800
RIGHTS HAS SAID THESE EXPULSIONS

03:18.866 --> 03:19.866
WOULD VIOLATE ISRAEL'S

03:19.933 --> 03:21.133
OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL

03:21.200 --> 03:22.266
LAW.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.066
SO IT IS NOT HARD TO SEE WHY

03:24.133 --> 03:25.833
SANITIZED TERMS LIKE "EVICTIONS"

03:25.900 --> 03:27.666
OR "PROPERTY DISPUTES" RANKLE

03:27.733 --> 03:30.833
THOSE WHO LIVE THERE.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.066
>> YOU GREW UP IN THE

03:32.133 --> 03:32.866
NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:32.933 --> 03:33.966
YOUR FAMILY HOME IS SLATED FOR

03:34.033 --> 03:34.666
EVICTION.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.233
WHAT IS THE SCENE RIGHT NOW?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.766
>> WELL, I -- THANK YOU SO MUCH

03:37.833 --> 03:38.666
FOR HAVING ME.

03:38.733 --> 03:39.833
TO START, IT'S NOT REALLY AN

03:39.900 --> 03:40.300
EVICTION.

03:40.366 --> 03:41.733
IT'S FORCED ETHNIC DISPLACEMENT,

03:41.800 --> 03:42.966
TO BE ACCURATE.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.100
EVICTION DOES NOT IMPLY THE

03:44.166 --> 03:46.133
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HEAVILY

03:46.200 --> 03:48.800
ARMED POLICE AND ARMY AND

03:48.866 --> 03:50.066
SETTLERS COLLUDING, BLOWING UP

03:50.133 --> 03:51.066
YOUR DOORS, THROWING YOUR

03:51.133 --> 03:52.200
CHILDREN FROM YOUR WINDOWS AND

03:52.266 --> 03:53.766
USING BRUTE FORCE TO THROW YOU

03:53.833 --> 03:54.766
OUT IN THE STREET AND ASSAULTING

03:54.833 --> 03:55.833
AND ARRESTING YOU SHOULD YOU

03:55.900 --> 03:57.000
RESIST.

03:57.066 --> 03:57.900
IT DOESN'T IMPLY THE GRENADES.

03:57.966 --> 03:58.866
IT DOESN'T IMPLY THE

03:58.933 --> 04:01.666
RUBBER-COATED BULLETS.

04:01.733 --> 04:02.033
>> John: RIGHT.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.233
THE THREAT OF EVICTION IS

04:03.300 --> 04:04.900
ACCURATE ONLY IN A VERY

04:04.966 --> 04:06.433
SUPERFICIAL LEVEL -- IN THAT ONE

04:06.500 --> 04:07.500
DAY YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE, THE NEXT

04:07.566 --> 04:08.133
DAY YOU DON'T, AND THAT CHANGE

04:08.200 --> 04:09.000
WASN'T YOUR CHOICE, BUT IT

04:09.066 --> 04:10.233
DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.833
IT'S LIKE RUNNING A HEADLINE

04:11.900 --> 04:12.866
THAT SAYS "MATT GAETZ REACHES

04:12.933 --> 04:14.400
OUT TO FLORIDA YOUTH."

04:14.466 --> 04:16.000
SURE, NOT INACCURATE.

04:16.066 --> 04:17.533
BUT IT'S MISSING SOME PRETTY

04:17.600 --> 04:18.700
CRUCIAL DETAILS ABOUT THE EXACT

04:18.766 --> 04:19.933
NATURE OF THAT INTERACTION.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.733
AND LOOK, IT IS TRUE THAT

04:21.800 --> 04:23.066
MILITANTS FROM PALESTINIAN

04:23.133 --> 04:24.600
GROUPS LIKE HAMAS FIRED OVER A

04:24.666 --> 04:26.066
THOUSAND ROCKETS TOWARD ISRAEL

04:26.133 --> 04:30.366
THIS WEEK, AND THAT IS

04:30.433 --> 04:30.700
REPREHENSIBLE.

04:30.766 --> 04:32.300
BUT -- AND I REALIZE THIS IS THE

04:32.366 --> 04:34.800
MOST LOAD-BEARING CONJUNCTION IN

04:34.866 --> 04:36.166
HISTORY, "BUT" -- THE MAJORITY

04:36.233 --> 04:38.966
OF THOSE ROCKETS THANKFULLY

04:39.033 --> 04:40.033
DIDN'T REACH THEIR TARGET, FOR A

04:40.100 --> 04:40.433
VERY CLEAR REASON.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.333
>> THE CASUALTIES AND THE DAMAGE

04:41.400 --> 04:42.633
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER BUT FOR

04:42.700 --> 04:43.966
ISRAELI INTERCEPTOR ROCKETS, THE

04:44.033 --> 04:45.600
SO-CALLED IRON DOME, WHICH BLEW

04:45.666 --> 04:47.666
MOST OF THE INCOMING MISSILES TO

04:47.733 --> 04:49.166
PIECES.

04:49.233 --> 04:50.833
>> John: YEAH, ISRAEL HAS AN

04:50.900 --> 04:52.900
SO-CALLED IRON DOME.

04:52.966 --> 04:54.700
AND I KNOW "WHAT IF WE BLEW UP

04:54.766 --> 04:56.833
THE ROCKETS WITH MORE ROCKETS?"

04:56.900 --> 04:57.733
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING SOMEONE

04:57.800 --> 04:58.366
DRUNKENLY WROTE DOWN ON A NAPKIN

04:58.433 --> 04:59.500
ONCE, BUT IT IS A REAL MILITARY

04:59.566 --> 05:04.400
DEFENSE SYSTEM THAT WORKS.

05:04.466 --> 05:06.400
AND I ALSO KNOW NOT ALL THE

05:06.466 --> 05:07.533
ROCKETS WERE SHOT DOWN.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.133
ISRAELI CIVILIANS WERE KILLED

05:08.200 --> 05:09.300
THIS WEEK, WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

05:09.366 --> 05:14.600
BUT THE POINT IS, THIS ISN'T

05:14.666 --> 05:17.433
"TIT FOR TAT."

05:17.500 --> 05:18.866
THERE IS A MASSIVE IMBALANCE

05:18.933 --> 05:20.233
WHEN IT COMES TO THE TWO SIDES'

05:20.300 --> 05:21.200
WEAPONRY AND CAPABILITIES.

05:21.266 --> 05:21.833
WHILE MOST OF THE ROCKETS AIMED

05:21.900 --> 05:22.400
TOWARD ISRAELI CITIZENS THIS

05:22.466 --> 05:23.033
WEEK WERE INTERCEPTED, ISRAEL'S

05:23.100 --> 05:24.366
AIR STRIKES WERE NOT.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.966
THEY HIT THEIR TARGETS,

05:27.033 --> 05:28.600
INCLUDING A HOUSE IN A REFUGEE

05:28.666 --> 05:30.000
CAMP, A BUILDING HOUSING THE

05:30.066 --> 05:31.900
ASSOCIATED PRESS AND AL JAZEERA,

05:31.966 --> 05:33.700
AND THIS 13-STORY OFFICE AND

05:33.766 --> 05:35.666
APARTMENT BUILDING.

05:35.733 --> 05:36.900
AND WHILE ISRAEL INSISTED THAT

05:36.966 --> 05:38.233
THERE WERE MILITARY TARGETS IN

05:38.300 --> 05:39.633
THAT BUILDING AND THAT THEY'D

05:39.700 --> 05:40.733
DESTROYED IT AS HUMANELY AS

05:40.800 --> 05:43.166
POSSIBLE, EVEN WARNING PEOPLE TO

05:43.233 --> 05:44.166
EVACUATE BEFOREHAND, FOR THE

05:44.233 --> 05:46.133
RECORD, "DESTROYING A CIVILIAN

05:46.200 --> 05:47.133
RESIDENCE" SURE SEEMS LIKE A WAR

05:47.200 --> 05:48.866
CRIME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU

05:48.933 --> 05:52.033
SEND A COURTESY HEADS-UP TEXT.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.766
AND WHEN DOZENS OF PEOPLE HAVE

05:53.833 --> 05:55.000
SEEN THEIR HOMES OR LIVELIHOODS

05:55.066 --> 05:56.633
DESTROYED, IT DOESN'T REALLY

05:56.700 --> 05:58.566
HELP THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY

05:58.633 --> 06:00.333
POSTED THIS TRIUMPHANT MEME

06:00.400 --> 06:04.466
SHOWING THE EXPLOSION AND THE

06:04.533 --> 06:05.033
RUBBLE LABELED "BEFORE" AND

06:05.100 --> 06:05.466
"AFTER."

06:05.533 --> 06:06.333
"LOOK WHAT WE DID!

06:06.400 --> 06:07.833
PEOPLE LIVED THERE BEFORE, AND

06:07.900 --> 06:08.866
NOW THEY CAN'T!

06:08.933 --> 06:10.166
YOU GET IT, RIGHT?"

06:10.233 --> 06:14.500
AND OBVIOUSLY, IN GENERAL, YOU

06:14.566 --> 06:16.033
SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER MEME

06:16.100 --> 06:16.700
A WAR CRIME.

06:16.766 --> 06:17.700
BUT IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO,

06:17.766 --> 06:18.333
AT LEAST GO WITH SOMETHING LESS

06:18.400 --> 06:18.933
BORING THAN THE BEFORE/AFTER

06:19.000 --> 06:19.300
TEMPLATE.

06:19.366 --> 06:20.333
MAYBE USE THE DRAKE MEME OR THE

06:20.400 --> 06:21.666
DISASTER GIRL.

06:21.733 --> 06:23.166
THERE'S A BUILDING COMING DOWN,

06:23.233 --> 06:24.400
SO CHECKMARK ALREADY THERE, AND

06:24.466 --> 06:25.766
IT'S A LITTLE GIRL WITH EYES

06:25.833 --> 06:27.333
THAT SCREAM "I DON'T KNOW WHAT

06:27.400 --> 06:27.966
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS ARE, AND

06:28.033 --> 06:28.533
FRANKLY, I DON'T CARE."

06:28.600 --> 06:29.266
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, IT

06:29.333 --> 06:31.600
WORKS PERFECTLY.

06:31.666 --> 06:32.433
THE FACT IS, THE CITIZENS OF

06:32.500 --> 06:34.833
GAZA DON'T HAVE AN IRON DOME TO

06:34.900 --> 06:36.100
PROTECT THEM THE WAY THAT THE

06:36.166 --> 06:37.533
CITIZENS OF ISRAEL DO.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.066
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY WAYS

06:39.133 --> 06:40.733
THEY'RE AT A SIGNIFICANT

06:40.800 --> 06:42.500
DISADVANTAGE.

06:42.566 --> 06:44.066
ALTHOUGH AN ISRAELI MILITARY

06:44.133 --> 06:44.933
SPOKESPERSON TRIED TO PUSH BACK

06:45.000 --> 06:46.100
ON THE IDEA THERE'S MUCH OF A

06:46.166 --> 06:47.866
DISCREPANCY THERE.

06:47.933 --> 06:49.633
>> SOMEBODY ON TWITTER SAID THAT

06:49.700 --> 06:51.033
THE PALESTINIANS DON'T HAVE AN

06:51.100 --> 06:53.866
IRON DOME.

06:53.933 --> 06:55.166
I SAY YES, THEY HAVE AN IRON

06:55.233 --> 06:55.366
DOME.

06:55.433 --> 06:56.200
IT'S CALLED "DON'T FIRE ROCKETS

06:56.266 --> 06:56.766
AT ISRAELI CIVILIANS AND WE

06:56.833 --> 06:58.100
WON'T FIRE ANYTHING AT GAZA."

06:58.166 --> 06:58.900
>> John: YEAH.

06:58.966 --> 06:59.566
BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

06:59.633 --> 07:00.600
DIFFERENCES.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.533
"IRON DOME," FOR ONE, SOUNDS

07:02.600 --> 07:04.166
MUCH COOLER, AND ALSO, IT HAS

07:04.233 --> 07:05.566
THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OF

07:05.633 --> 07:07.500
BEING AN ACTUAL DEFENSE SYSTEM

07:07.566 --> 07:08.833
THAT EXISTS, UNLIKE GAZA'S,

07:08.900 --> 07:10.200
WHICH IS MOSTLY, "TRY NOT TO BE

07:10.266 --> 07:12.266
WHERE THE BOMBS ARE LANDING."

07:12.333 --> 07:14.266
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE,

07:14.333 --> 07:15.700
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

07:15.766 --> 07:16.766
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOT

07:16.833 --> 07:19.166
PART OF HAMAS.

07:19.233 --> 07:20.033
THEY DON'T GET TOGETHER AND ALL

07:20.100 --> 07:21.600
DECIDE TO LAUNCH ROCKETS.

07:21.666 --> 07:24.566
IT'S NOT A FUCKING CO-OP BOARD.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.166
BUT WHEN ISRAEL FIRES ROCKETS AT

07:26.233 --> 07:27.700
GAZA, IT ENDANGERS ALL

07:27.766 --> 07:29.266
PALESTINIANS THERE.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.966
MAYBE "SOMEBODY ON TWITTER"

07:31.033 --> 07:32.566
COULD POINT THAT OUT TO THAT

07:32.633 --> 07:33.766
GUY.

07:33.833 --> 07:34.800
TO PEOPLE IN GAZA, IT CAN SEEM

07:34.866 --> 07:36.266
LIKE THE ONLY TIME ANYONE PAYS

07:36.333 --> 07:37.533
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING

07:37.600 --> 07:38.333
THERE IS WHEN HAMAS IS FIRING

07:38.400 --> 07:40.366
ROCKETS, WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLY

07:40.433 --> 07:41.633
VERY FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE

07:41.700 --> 07:43.666
THEY'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A

07:43.733 --> 07:44.166
SUFFOCATING BLOCKADE FOR

07:44.233 --> 07:46.333
14 YEARS.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.166
AND IN ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED

07:48.233 --> 07:50.733
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES,

07:50.800 --> 07:52.233
PALESTINIANS ARE ESSENTIALLY

07:52.300 --> 07:54.100
BEING GOVERNED BY A FORM OF

07:54.166 --> 07:55.266
APARTHEID, AN ASSESSMENT SIGNED

07:55.333 --> 07:55.900
OFF ON BY BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND

07:55.966 --> 07:58.400
ISRAELI HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS.

07:58.466 --> 07:59.833
LIFE IN GAZA IS HARD EVEN WHEN

07:59.900 --> 08:01.866
THEY'RE NOT BEING BOMBED.

08:01.933 --> 08:03.566
AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS

08:03.633 --> 08:04.600
IMPLICITLY COSIGNED ON THE

08:04.666 --> 08:06.533
BRUTALLY HARD LINE ISRAEL HAS

08:06.600 --> 08:07.900
BEEN TAKING.

08:07.966 --> 08:09.166
THIS GUY BASICALLY GAVE ISRAEL A

08:09.233 --> 08:10.100
GREEN LIGHT TO DO ANYTHING IT

08:10.166 --> 08:11.933
WANTED FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.100
AND WHILE BIDEN HAS HAD THE

08:13.166 --> 08:14.300
OPPORTUNITY TO RESET THAT

08:14.366 --> 08:15.600
RELATIONSHIP, HIS

08:15.666 --> 08:16.700
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE THIS

08:16.766 --> 08:18.433
WEEK HAS BEEN DEEPLY

08:18.500 --> 08:20.166
UNDERWHELMING, GIVING A GENERIC

08:20.233 --> 08:22.333
STATEMENT THAT "ISRAEL HAS A

08:22.400 --> 08:24.800
RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF."

08:24.866 --> 08:26.533
IT'S THE EXACT SAME LINE THAT

08:26.600 --> 08:27.900
OBAMA SAID AND THAT BUSH SAID

08:27.966 --> 08:29.366
BEFORE HIM.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.900
"ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND

08:31.966 --> 08:32.900
ITSELF" IS JUST SOMETHING ALL

08:32.966 --> 08:34.166
PRESIDENTS END UP SAYING OUT

08:34.233 --> 08:35.700
LOUD AT SOME POINT IN OFFICE,

08:35.766 --> 08:36.666
LIKE "MY FELLOW AMERICANS" OR

08:36.733 --> 08:38.266
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE ARE NO

08:38.333 --> 08:39.133
ALIENS?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.900
THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT."

08:41.966 --> 08:43.766
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT ISRAEL

08:43.833 --> 08:44.466
DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND

08:44.533 --> 08:45.866
ITSELF -- IT'S JUST THAT LINE

08:45.933 --> 08:47.333
CANNOT BE USED TO EXCUSE

08:47.400 --> 08:48.166
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

08:48.233 --> 08:50.200
MULTIPLE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

08:50.266 --> 08:51.633
KILLED THIS WEEK -- EIGHT IN A

08:51.700 --> 08:53.900
SINGLE STRIKE JUST YESTERDAY.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.800
AND THE U.S. IS HEAVILY

08:55.866 --> 08:57.633
IMPLICATED HERE, NOT JUST BY

08:57.700 --> 08:59.166
SERVING AS ISRAEL'S DIPLOMATIC

08:59.233 --> 09:00.833
SHIELD AT THE U.N., BUT BY

09:00.900 --> 09:03.300
CONSTANTLY REFUSING TO CRITICIZE

09:03.366 --> 09:05.300
THE INDEFENSIBLE.

09:05.366 --> 09:07.100
WATCH AS JUST THIS WEEK A STATE

09:07.166 --> 09:08.466
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN DESPERATELY

09:08.533 --> 09:10.033
TRIED TO EQUIVOCATE WHEN ASKED A

09:10.100 --> 09:12.566
PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION.

09:12.633 --> 09:13.600
>> I WANT TO ASK ON EAST

09:13.666 --> 09:14.233
JERUSALEM.

09:14.300 --> 09:14.800
I DON'T WANT TO HARP ON THIS

09:14.866 --> 09:15.833
EITHER.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.166
BUT THE ISRAELIS KILLED 13

09:17.233 --> 09:18.300
PEOPLE JUST NOW, YOU KNOW,

09:18.366 --> 09:19.466
INCLUDING MAYBE FIVE OR SIX

09:19.533 --> 09:19.800
CHILDREN.

09:19.866 --> 09:20.333
DO YOU CONDEMN THAT?

09:20.400 --> 09:21.600
DO YOU CONDEMN THE KILLING OF

09:21.666 --> 09:23.433
CHILDREN?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.133
>> SAID --

09:24.200 --> 09:26.033
>> I'M ASKING, DO YOU CONDEMN

09:26.100 --> 09:27.133
THE KILLING OF PALESTINIAN

09:27.200 --> 09:28.666
CHILDREN?

09:28.733 --> 09:29.933
>> OBVIOUSLY -- AND THESE

09:30.000 --> 09:31.733
REPORTS ARE JUST EMERGING.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.466
AND I UNDERSTAND -- I WAS JUST

09:32.533 --> 09:33.433
SPEAKING TO THE TEAM.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.466
I UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE

09:35.533 --> 09:36.033
INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF

09:36.100 --> 09:36.766
FACTS ON THE GROUND YET, SO I'M

09:36.833 --> 09:39.633
VERY HESITANT TO GET INTO

09:39.700 --> 09:40.300
REPORTS THAT ARE JUST EMERGING.

09:40.366 --> 09:41.266
OBVIOUSLY, THE DEATHS OF

09:41.333 --> 09:43.366
CIVILIANS, BE THEY ISRAELI OR

09:43.433 --> 09:44.566
PALESTINIANS, ARE SOMETHING WE

09:44.633 --> 09:46.933
WOULD TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.500
>> John: HOLY SHIT, HE JUST

09:48.566 --> 09:49.600
ASKED YOU, "IS CHILD MURDER

09:49.666 --> 09:51.700
BAD?"

09:51.766 --> 09:52.433
THIS REALLY ISN'T HARD.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.200
JUST SAY YES.

09:55.266 --> 09:56.366
THE ONLY SCENARIO IN WHICH THE

09:56.433 --> 09:57.566
ANSWER TO "IS KILLING CHILDREN

09:57.633 --> 09:59.266
WRONG?" GETS TRICKY IS IF YOU'RE

09:59.333 --> 10:00.533
A TIME TRAVELER IN 1890s

10:00.600 --> 10:01.366
AUSTRIA TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY

10:01.433 --> 10:02.633
YOU JUST KILLED THE HITLER

10:02.700 --> 10:04.100
FAMILY'S BOUNCING NEW BABY BOY.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.200
"I KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS, BUT

10:06.266 --> 10:09.933
TRUST ME: IT IS COMPLICATED."

10:10.000 --> 10:11.800
LOOK, THERE IS A REAL TENDENCY,

10:11.866 --> 10:14.133
PARTICULARLY IN AMERICA, TO

10:14.200 --> 10:15.933
"BOTH SIDES" THIS SITUATION, AND

10:16.000 --> 10:17.133
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE AREN'T

10:17.200 --> 10:18.166
SOME AREAS WHERE THAT'S

10:18.233 --> 10:20.133
WARRANTED, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

10:20.200 --> 10:25.700
RECOGNIZE THERE ARE ALSO AREAS

10:25.766 --> 10:26.200
WHERE IT'S SIMPLY NOT.

10:26.266 --> 10:27.100
BOTH SIDES ARE FIRING ROCKETS,

10:27.166 --> 10:27.933
BUT ONE SIDE HAS ONE OF THE MOST

10:28.000 --> 10:28.466
ADVANCED MILITARIES IN THE

10:28.533 --> 10:29.166
WORLD.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.566
BOTH SIDES ARE SUFFERING

10:30.633 --> 10:31.166
HEARTBREAKING CASUALTIES, BUT

10:31.233 --> 10:31.900
ONE SIDE IS SUFFERING THEM

10:31.966 --> 10:33.500
EXPONENTIALLY.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.800
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE U.S. IS

10:34.866 --> 10:35.833
OPERATING FROM THE MORAL HIGH

10:35.900 --> 10:36.566
GROUND HERE.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.733
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NO STRANGER TO

10:38.800 --> 10:40.200
DRONE-STRIKING WEDDINGS AND

10:40.266 --> 10:41.333
SAYING, "WE WERE JUST TRYING TO

10:41.400 --> 10:42.833
TARGET ENEMY COMBATANTS."

10:42.900 --> 10:45.866
THIS COUNTRY HAS BLOOD ON ITS

10:45.933 --> 10:46.133
HANDS TOO.

10:46.200 --> 10:46.933
AND LOOK, IF YOU BELIEVE

10:47.000 --> 10:49.466
ISRAEL'S ACTIONS ARE WARRANTED

10:49.533 --> 10:50.200
AND PROPORTIONATE THIS WEEK,

10:50.266 --> 10:51.766
YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY AND MAKE

10:51.833 --> 10:52.933
THAT ARGUMENT.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.966
BUT WE'VE GOT TO START HAVING

10:55.033 --> 10:56.333
THIS CONVERSATION HONESTLY, AND

10:56.400 --> 10:57.933
FALLING BACK ON CONVENIENT

10:58.000 --> 10:59.800
SANITIZED TERMS LIKE

10:59.866 --> 11:01.433
"REAL ESTATE DISPUTES" AND

11:01.500 --> 11:04.133
"AIR STRIKES ON MILITANTS" FEELS

11:04.200 --> 11:05.800
DISINGENUOUS WHEN WHAT YOU'RE

11:05.866 --> 11:07.600
DESCRIBING IS "FORCING PEOPLE

11:07.666 --> 11:08.600
FROM THE HOMES THEY'VE LIVED IN

11:08.666 --> 11:10.000
FOR DECADES AND KILLING

11:10.066 --> 11:12.866
CIVILIANS AND CHILDREN."

11:12.933 --> 11:14.333
AND AGAIN, NONE OF THIS FREES

11:14.400 --> 11:15.800
HAMAS FROM RESPONSIBILITY.

11:15.866 --> 11:17.400
BUT HAMAS DOESN'T REPRESENT ALL

11:17.466 --> 11:18.700
PALESTINIANS, JUST AS WHAT

11:18.766 --> 11:20.366
ISRAEL IS DOING RIGHT NOW

11:20.433 --> 11:22.533
DOESN'T REPRESENT ALL ISRAELIS,

11:22.600 --> 11:24.600
OR INDEED JEWISH PEOPLE.

11:24.666 --> 11:29.733
LOTS IS COMPLICATED HERE, BUT

11:29.800 --> 11:30.933
SOME THINGS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.933
ONE SIDE IS SUFFERING MUCH MORE.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.400
AND IF AMERICA REALLY WANTS TO

11:35.466 --> 11:36.233
HELP, IT MIGHT WANT TO SERIOUSLY

11:36.300 --> 11:37.233
CONSIDER CHANGING ITS LONG-HELD

11:37.300 --> 11:38.033
POSITION HERE.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.933
BECAUSE FOR DECADES, THE

11:40.000 --> 11:40.733
BACKBONE OF AMERICA'S POLICY IN

11:40.800 --> 11:43.700
THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN THAT

11:43.766 --> 11:44.333
AMERICA IS AN UNWAVERING FRIEND

11:44.400 --> 11:46.633
TO ISRAEL.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.966
WHICH IS A GREAT THING TO BE,

11:48.033 --> 11:49.166
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I

11:49.233 --> 11:51.933
WOULD HOPE THAT A REAL FRIEND

11:52.000 --> 11:52.933
WILL TELL ME WHEN I'M BEING AN

11:53.000 --> 11:56.700
ASSHOLE AND DEFINITELY WHEN I'M

11:56.766 --> 11:57.933
COMMITTING A FUCKING WAR CRIME.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.033
AND NOW THIS.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.100
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

12:01.166 --> 12:05.866
ARI MELBER, RAP GENIUS.

12:05.933 --> 12:11.733
WILL JUST NOT FUCKING STOP.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.266
>> GOOD EVENING, AS SMITH WOULD

12:15.333 --> 12:15.833
SAY.

12:15.900 --> 12:19.466
>> ALL THIS CHASING.

12:19.533 --> 12:20.533
TO PARAPHRASE LAURYN HILL, HE

12:20.600 --> 12:22.733
MAY THINK IS MORE POWERFUL THAN

12:22.800 --> 12:23.900
TWO CLEOPATRA'S BUT HE IS STILL

12:23.966 --> 12:26.733
READY TO FLIP IT IN THE SWAMP ON

12:26.800 --> 12:27.966
A DIRTY MATTRESS.

12:28.033 --> 12:30.466
THERE IS A LYRIC FOR THAT,

12:30.533 --> 12:32.033
MARGARET, WHICH IS JAY-Z SAID,

12:32.100 --> 12:33.700
MAMA ALWAYS TOLD ME DON'T ARGUE

12:33.766 --> 12:35.000
WITH FOOLS BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM A

12:35.066 --> 12:37.833
DISTANCE CAN'T SEE WHO IS WHO.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.833
I HATE THE NEW KANYE, THE BAD

12:40.900 --> 12:44.433
MOOD KANYE, THE NEWS KANYE, I

12:44.500 --> 12:45.233
MISS THE OLD KANYE.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.633
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR, ALL I

12:47.700 --> 12:53.133
SEE IS FALSE.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.433
FLAWS.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.366
I BELIEVE THERE'S A GOD ABOVE

12:56.433 --> 12:56.533
ME.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.900
AND THAT TRUST THE GOD OF

12:58.966 --> 12:59.333
EVERYTHING ELSE

12:59.400 --> 13:04.066
THAT'S PRETTY POWERFUL.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.733
IT WASN'T AT DRAKE WHO SAID, THE

13:05.800 --> 13:07.866
GAME IS SOLD SEPARATE.

13:07.933 --> 13:09.900
ANOTHER W WAY TO PUT IT IS, IT

13:09.966 --> 13:11.566
STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM AND NOW

13:11.633 --> 13:12.333
WE ARE HERE.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.733
>> YOU COULD PUT IT THAT WAY,

13:14.800 --> 13:22.866
ARI, NOW WE -- YOU COULD.

13:22.933 --> 13:23.900
>> John: MOVING ON.

13:23.966 --> 13:24.533
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

13:24.600 --> 13:24.933
GUNS.

13:25.000 --> 13:25.900
Y'KNOW, BIG PEW-PEW STICKS THAT

13:25.966 --> 13:28.400
GO BOOM-BOOM.

13:28.466 --> 13:29.433
GUNS ARE EVERYWHERE IN AMERICA,

13:29.500 --> 13:29.966
AND I DO MEAN EVERYWHERE.

13:30.033 --> 13:30.600
>> HOW MANY GUNS DO YOU THINK I

13:30.666 --> 13:31.233
CAN HIDE UNDERNEATH A HAWAIIAN

13:31.300 --> 13:31.433
SHIRT?

13:31.500 --> 13:32.066
OF COURSE, WE GOT THE GRAY MAN.

13:32.133 --> 13:32.733
GOT MY BERETTA MODEL 85.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.333
FEELS LIKE A KAHR ARMED CT45.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.166
CHARTER ARMS UNDERCOVER .38

13:34.233 --> 13:34.466
SPECIAL.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.600
GRANDPA DAVE'S OLD DERRINGER.

13:35.666 --> 13:38.000
THIS IS A SCCY CPX-2.

13:38.066 --> 13:39.600
SMITH & WESSON 442.

13:39.666 --> 13:40.366
OH, WAIT!

13:40.433 --> 13:44.066
ONE MORE.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.500
NORTH AMERICAN ARMS SIDEWINDER

13:45.566 --> 13:46.300
.22 MAGNUM, JUST IN CASE YOU

13:46.366 --> 13:47.866
NEED SOMETHING SMALL.

13:47.933 --> 13:51.566
>> John: WOW.

13:51.633 --> 13:52.066
THAT IS THE SECOND-MOST

13:52.133 --> 13:53.066
HORRIFYING THING YOU CAN FIND

13:53.133 --> 13:54.000
COMING AT YOU IN A HAWAIIAN

13:54.066 --> 13:55.300
SHIRT, RIGHT AFTER JOHN LASSETER

13:55.366 --> 13:57.233
ON "NATIONAL HUG YOUR BOSS DAY."

13:57.300 --> 13:58.600
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THE REVEAL

13:58.666 --> 13:59.700
OF THE THUMBELINA-SIZED GUN IN

13:59.766 --> 14:00.333
HIS TOMMY BAHAMA POCKET WAS AN

14:00.400 --> 14:03.033
M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN-WORTHY TWIST.

14:03.100 --> 14:03.466
WELL DONE, TINY GUN.

14:03.533 --> 14:04.533
YOU ARE BOTH SUPERFLUOUS AND

14:04.600 --> 14:05.933
SURPRISING.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.066
BUT THIS STORY ISN'T SO MUCH

14:08.133 --> 14:10.333
ABOUT GUNS THEMSELVES, AS IT IS

14:10.400 --> 14:11.566
ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR LAW THAT'S

14:11.633 --> 14:12.900
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED HOW

14:12.966 --> 14:14.633
THEY'RE USED.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.233
I'M TALKING ABOUT

14:17.300 --> 14:19.266
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.066
30 STATES CURRENTLY HAVE THEM.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.166
AND WHILE THEY WERE INITIALLY

14:22.233 --> 14:22.700
PITCHED AS A LAW-AND-ORDER

14:22.766 --> 14:23.333
MEASURE TO PROTECT PEOPLE FORCED

14:23.400 --> 14:25.166
TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS IN

14:25.233 --> 14:26.000
IMPOSSIBLE LIFE-OR-DEATH

14:26.066 --> 14:27.833
SITUATIONS, IN PRACTICE THEY CAN

14:27.900 --> 14:29.466
BE INVOKED IN INCIDENTS THAT

14:29.533 --> 14:31.400
REALLY SEEM LIKE THEY DIDN'T

14:31.466 --> 14:32.866
NEED TO TURN DEADLY.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.366
>> THE MAN WHO SHOT AND KILLED A

14:34.433 --> 14:35.566
FATHER OF FOUR AT A FLORISSANT

14:35.633 --> 14:36.666
BAR IS FREE TONIGHT.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.133
SO FAR, THE GUNMAN'S NOT FACING

14:38.200 --> 14:39.133
CHARGES FOR THE SHOOTING AT

14:39.200 --> 14:42.000
SHOW-ME'S BAR AND GRILL.

14:42.066 --> 14:43.533
>> THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY

14:43.600 --> 14:44.133
PROSECUTOR SAYS HE NEEDS MORE

14:44.200 --> 14:45.966
TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER HE'LL

14:46.033 --> 14:46.500
PROSECUTE THE GUNMAN.

14:46.566 --> 14:47.300
THAT'S BECAUSE MISSOURI'S

14:47.366 --> 14:48.066
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW IS

14:48.133 --> 14:55.433
COMPLICATED.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.033
SCOTT BEARY WAS KILLED WHEN

14:56.100 --> 14:56.700
AN ARGUMENT OVER HOW HEAVY A DOG

14:56.766 --> 14:57.466
COULD WEIGH BECAME PHYSICAL.

14:57.533 --> 14:57.900
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

14:57.966 --> 14:58.733
NOT ONLY IS THAT A MASSIVE

14:58.800 --> 14:59.900
OVERREACTION, IT'S A POINTLESS

14:59.966 --> 15:02.033
ARGUMENT.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.500
EVERYONE KNOWS DOGS COME IN A

15:03.566 --> 15:04.800
WIDE ARRAY OF SIZES, FROM

15:04.866 --> 15:05.900
POCKET-SIZED SWEETIES TO

15:05.966 --> 15:07.400
SLENDER KINGS TO DENSE BOYS TO

15:07.466 --> 15:09.100
DROOPY BOYS TO BIG HONKIN' BOYS

15:09.166 --> 15:12.200
TO STANDARD.

15:12.266 --> 15:15.066
THAT'S JUST VETERINARY SCIENCE.

15:15.133 --> 15:15.666
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS GAINED

15:15.733 --> 15:16.633
NOTORIETY NEARLY A DECADE AGO

15:16.700 --> 15:18.066
WHEN POLICE CLAIMED FLORIDA'S

15:18.133 --> 15:19.200
LAW KEPT THEM FROM INITIALLY

15:19.266 --> 15:20.200
ARRESTING GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AFTER

15:20.266 --> 15:22.600
HE SHOT AND KILLED 17-YEAR-OLD

15:22.666 --> 15:23.866
TRAYVON MARTIN.

15:23.933 --> 15:25.733
MORE RECENTLY, THEY'VE BEEN

15:25.800 --> 15:28.933
FLOATED AS A POTENTIAL DEFENSE

15:29.000 --> 15:30.133
FOR THE KILLERS OF AHMAUD

15:30.200 --> 15:31.333
ARBERY.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.066
AND THOSE ARE JUST TWO

15:33.133 --> 15:34.066
DEVASTATING EXAMPLES OF MANY.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.233
AND DON'T WORRY, WE'RE NOT GOING

15:35.300 --> 15:36.333
TO SHOW YOU THE

15:36.400 --> 15:37.200
FAR-TOO-PLENTIFUL FOOTAGE OF

15:37.266 --> 15:39.266
PEOPLE GETTING SHOT IN PUBLIC

15:39.333 --> 15:40.000
PLACES TONIGHT.

15:40.066 --> 15:40.666
FRANKLY, WE'RE JUST ONE

15:40.733 --> 15:41.666
SENSELESS MURDER AWAY FROM HBO

15:41.733 --> 15:42.700
MAX PUTTING THIS SHOW IN THE

15:42.766 --> 15:43.733
"ENDLESS PARADE OF HUMAN MISERY"

15:43.800 --> 15:44.466
CATEGORY ALONGSIDE "CHERNOBYL"

15:44.533 --> 15:45.900
AND "ENTOURAGE."

15:45.966 --> 15:47.500
BUT GIVEN THE PREVALENCE OF

15:47.566 --> 15:48.600
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS -- AND

15:48.666 --> 15:50.133
THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN WHO

15:50.200 --> 15:51.100
THEY DO, AND CRUCIALLY, DON'T

15:51.166 --> 15:51.966
PROTECT -- WE THOUGHT TONIGHT

15:52.033 --> 15:52.800
IT'D BE WORTH LOOKING AT THEM.

15:52.866 --> 15:53.500
AND LET'S START WITH WHY,

15:53.566 --> 15:54.833
EXACTLY, STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS

15:54.900 --> 15:57.966
WERE CREATED.

15:58.033 --> 15:59.766
BECAUSE BEFORE THEY CAME ALONG,

15:59.833 --> 16:01.933
MOST STATES ALREADY HAD

16:02.000 --> 16:04.066
SELF-DEFENSE LAWS ON THE BOOKS

16:04.133 --> 16:05.833
THAT TRADITIONALLY INCLUDED AN

16:05.900 --> 16:08.833
ELEMENT KNOWN AS A "DUTY TO

16:08.900 --> 16:09.833
RETREAT," MEANING YOU COULDN'T

16:09.900 --> 16:12.333
RESORT TO USING DEADLY FORCE IN

16:12.400 --> 16:14.666
A CONFRONTATION IF YOU COULD

16:14.733 --> 16:16.233
SAFELY AVOID OR DE-ESCALATE IT.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.366
NOW, IN MANY STATES, AN

16:18.433 --> 16:19.833
EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE WAS A

16:19.900 --> 16:22.400
SO-CALLED "CASTLE DOCTRINE," A

16:22.466 --> 16:24.066
LEGAL THEORY ARGUING THAT YOUR

16:24.133 --> 16:25.833
HOME IS YOUR CASTLE, AND THERE,

16:25.900 --> 16:27.866
YOU CAN USE DEADLY FORCE MUCH

16:27.933 --> 16:28.833
MORE BROADLY TO PROTECT YOURSELF

16:28.900 --> 16:29.600
AGAINST INTRUDERS.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.200
THE KEY THING STAND-YOUR-GROUND

16:31.266 --> 16:32.300
LAWS DID WAS REMOVE THAT "DUTY

16:32.366 --> 16:34.533
TO RETREAT" FROM PUBLIC PLACES,

16:34.600 --> 16:36.033
BASICALLY EXTENDING THE CASTLE

16:36.100 --> 16:37.866
DOCTRINE TO ANYWHERE YOU HAVE A

16:37.933 --> 16:39.866
LEGAL RIGHT TO BE.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.133
IF YOU HAVE A "REASONABLE FEAR"

16:41.200 --> 16:42.633
SOMEONE MIGHT HURT YOU, YOU HAVE

16:42.700 --> 16:44.133
JUST AS MUCH RIGHT TO SHOOT THEM

16:44.200 --> 16:45.300
IN THE STREET AS YOU WOULD IF

16:45.366 --> 16:46.333
THEY WERE COMING THROUGH THE

16:46.400 --> 16:47.466
WINDOW OF YOUR HOUSE.

16:47.533 --> 16:49.800
AND THIS CHANGE WAS LARGELY

16:49.866 --> 16:51.266
THANKS TO THE ADVOCACY OF ONE

16:51.333 --> 16:52.200
WOMAN WITH A PRETTY COMPELLING

16:52.266 --> 16:53.566
STORY.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.633
>> MARION HAMMER SAYS SHE WAS

16:55.700 --> 16:56.266
WALKING TO HER CAR AFTER A LONG

16:56.333 --> 16:58.233
DAY AT THE OFFICE WHEN SHE WAS

16:58.300 --> 17:01.966
ACCOSTED BY A CAR FULL OF MEN.

17:02.033 --> 17:05.700
BUT SHE HAD A SURPRISE FOR THEM.

17:05.766 --> 17:07.133
>> I DREW THE GUN UP THROUGH THE

17:07.200 --> 17:08.600
HEADLIGHTS OF THE CAR AND I

17:08.666 --> 17:10.466
AIMED AT THE DRIVER.

17:10.533 --> 17:14.066
AND SOMEBODY IN THE CAR

17:14.133 --> 17:16.733
SCREAMED, "THE BITCH GOT A GUN!"

17:16.800 --> 17:22.333
>> John: "THE BITCH GOT A GUN."

17:22.400 --> 17:23.700
I HONESTLY DID NOT EXPECT TO

17:23.766 --> 17:24.233
HEAR THAT COME OUT OF THAT

17:24.300 --> 17:24.900
WOMAN'S MOUTH.

17:24.966 --> 17:25.600
"HELP YOURSELF TO SOME HARD

17:25.666 --> 17:26.466
CANDIES IN THE CERAMIC PIG"?

17:26.533 --> 17:26.766
ABSOLUTELY.

17:26.833 --> 17:27.333
"TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS SO YOU

17:27.400 --> 17:27.933
DON'T TRACK ANYTHING ONTO THE

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
WALL-TO-WALL CARPETING"?

17:29.066 --> 17:29.433
OF COURSE.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.400
BUT A CURSE WORD?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.066
IN THE DAYLIGHT?

17:32.133 --> 17:33.600
NOT IN 10,000 CONTRACTIONS OF

17:33.666 --> 17:35.100
THE UNIVERSE.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.233
BUT THE IMPORTANT PART OF HER

17:36.300 --> 17:37.166
STORY CONCERNS WHAT SHE CLAIMS A

17:37.233 --> 17:38.533
POLICE CHIEF SAID TO HER AFTER

17:38.600 --> 17:41.233
SHE'D TOLD HER STORY PUBLICLY.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.200
>> THE POLICE CHIEF TOLD ME,

17:44.266 --> 17:45.866
"WELL, IN THAT SITUATION, IF

17:45.933 --> 17:46.600
YOU'D CALLED THE POLICE, WE'D

17:46.666 --> 17:49.866
HAVE ARRESTED YOU, BECAUSE YOU

17:49.933 --> 17:51.166
WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO EMPLOYED

17:51.233 --> 17:54.933
THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE."

17:55.000 --> 17:58.700
AND THAT MADE ME ANGRY.

17:58.766 --> 17:59.966
>> John: AND THAT ARGUMENT IS

18:00.033 --> 18:01.666
THE ABSOLUTE CORE OF THE CASE

18:01.733 --> 18:02.800
FOR STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS --

18:02.866 --> 18:04.166
THAT MARION HAMMER COULD HAVE

18:04.233 --> 18:05.200
BEEN ARRESTED FOR SIMPLY

18:05.266 --> 18:06.766
DEFENDING HERSELF.

18:06.833 --> 18:07.566
NOW, SHE WASN'T, OF COURSE.

18:07.633 --> 18:08.000
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

18:08.066 --> 18:08.866
BUT SOMEONE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE

18:08.933 --> 18:10.133
BEEN, AND THAT MADE HER ANGRY.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.200
BUT A FEW THINGS.

18:12.266 --> 18:13.900
BECAUSE WHILE EVERYTHING ABOUT

18:13.966 --> 18:15.233
MARION HAMMER SEEMS LIKE A

18:15.300 --> 18:16.066
SWEET, EVERYDAY GRANDMOTHER --

18:16.133 --> 18:17.533
RIGHT DOWN TO THIS FELINE

18:17.600 --> 18:19.200
GLAMOUR SHOT OF HER POSTED ON A

18:19.266 --> 18:21.100
CAT BREEDER'S WEBSITE -- YOU

18:21.166 --> 18:22.333
SHOULD KNOW SHE'S ALSO ONE THE

18:22.400 --> 18:23.300
COUNTRY'S MOST POWERFUL GUN

18:23.366 --> 18:24.866
LOBBYISTS AND A FORMER PRESIDENT

18:24.933 --> 18:27.533
OF THE NRA.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.166
SHE'S PERSONALLY HELPED PUSH

18:29.233 --> 18:33.200
THROUGH DOZENS OF GUN LAWS IN

18:33.266 --> 18:34.300
FLORIDA ALONE, INCLUDING A 1987

18:34.366 --> 18:35.900
BILL ALLOWING CONCEAL AND CARRY

18:35.966 --> 18:36.900
PERMITS -- A LAW THEN

18:36.966 --> 18:38.466
DUPLICATED, IN SOME FORM, IN

18:38.533 --> 18:40.300
ALMOST EVERY STATE, LEADING TO

18:40.366 --> 18:41.866
MORE THAN 16 MILLION AMERICANS

18:41.933 --> 18:43.600
CURRENTLY HAVING LICENSES TO

18:43.666 --> 18:44.733
CARRY CONCEALED HANDGUNS.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.400
SO THAT MARGARITAVILLE ARSENAL

18:46.466 --> 18:47.500
YOU SAW EARLIER?

18:47.566 --> 18:48.700
YOU HAVE THIS DANA CARVEY

18:48.766 --> 18:49.833
CHARACTER TO THANK FOR THAT

18:49.900 --> 18:52.900
SITUATION.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.466
AND WHILE IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

18:55.533 --> 18:57.100
RELEVANT, HAMMER'S ADVOCACY

18:57.166 --> 18:58.600
WASN'T LIMITED TO GUNS.

18:58.666 --> 18:59.733
SHE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY KILLED A

18:59.800 --> 19:00.700
PETITION FROM 10,000 SCHOOL

19:00.766 --> 19:02.400
CHILDREN TO CHANGE THE FLORIDA

19:02.466 --> 19:03.866
STATE BIRD TO THE SCRUB JAY, A

19:03.933 --> 19:06.666
BIRD SO FRIENDLY IT APPARENTLY

19:06.733 --> 19:09.333
EATS PEANUTS OUT OF YOUR HAND.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.066
SHE OBJECTED BECAUSE, IN HER

19:10.133 --> 19:11.533
WORDS, "BEGGING FOR FOOD ISN'T

19:11.600 --> 19:12.233
SWEET," "IT'S LAZY AND IT'S A

19:12.300 --> 19:13.800
WELFARE MENTALITY."

19:13.866 --> 19:15.933
AND "THEY EAT THE EGGS OF OTHER

19:16.000 --> 19:16.766
BIRDS, THAT'S ROBBERY AND

19:16.833 --> 19:17.800
MURDER.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.600
I DON'T THINK SCRUB JAYS CAN

19:19.666 --> 19:21.000
EVEN SING."

19:21.066 --> 19:22.333
AND, OKAY, SLOW DOWN THERE,

19:22.400 --> 19:23.200
MARION.

19:23.266 --> 19:24.033
SET ASIDE "LAZY,"

19:24.100 --> 19:25.600
"WELFARE MENTALITY," AND

19:25.666 --> 19:26.533
"ROBBERY AND MURDER," WHICH IS A

19:26.600 --> 19:29.266
LOT TO PUT ON A BIRD.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.766
"SCRUB JAYS CAN'T SING"?

19:30.833 --> 19:34.833
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL THAT TO

19:34.900 --> 19:35.966
THE SCRUB JAY, MARION.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.666
[BIRD CHIRPING]

19:37.733 --> 19:39.633
SEE?

19:39.700 --> 19:40.400
THAT'S FINE.

19:40.466 --> 19:43.800
IS IT GREAT?

19:43.866 --> 19:44.766
NO, IT'S NOT GREAT.

19:44.833 --> 19:45.033
IT'S FINE.

19:45.100 --> 19:45.766
THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

19:45.833 --> 19:46.366
SURE, THE BIRD'S NO MARIAH, BUT

19:46.433 --> 19:46.900
IT'S ALSO NO ROSEANNE.

19:46.966 --> 19:47.633
IF THAT BIRD IS ANYONE, IT'S

19:47.700 --> 19:48.233
FERGIE.

19:48.300 --> 19:48.966
YOU HEARD ME.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.166
THE SCRUB JAY IS FERGIE.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.566
TWEET IT, TOK IT, PUT IT IN YOUR

19:51.633 --> 19:51.800
POCKET.

19:51.866 --> 19:52.533
I'VE MADE A FLIMSY TAKE AND I'M

19:52.600 --> 19:55.000
PROUD OF IT.

19:55.066 --> 19:57.433
THE POINT IS, MARION HAMMER

19:57.500 --> 19:58.433
PLAYED A BIG PART IN PASSING ONE

19:58.500 --> 19:59.966
OF THE COUNTRY'S FIRST

20:00.033 --> 20:01.266
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS, IN

20:01.333 --> 20:01.533
FLORIDA.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.033
AND THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL WAS

20:03.100 --> 20:04.000
IMMENSELY USEFUL TO THE NRA

20:04.066 --> 20:05.300
BECAUSE IT BECAME A MODEL FOR

20:05.366 --> 20:07.266
LAWS THEY COULD THEN PUSH AROUND

20:07.333 --> 20:08.133
THE COUNTRY.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.333
WAYNE LaPIERRE OPENLY SAID AT

20:10.400 --> 20:11.066
THE TIME THAT FLORIDA WAS THE

20:11.133 --> 20:12.200
FIRST STEP OF A MULTI-STATE

20:12.266 --> 20:13.200
STRATEGY, AND THEY WERE GOING TO

20:13.266 --> 20:14.366
USE THE TAILWIND TO MOVE FROM

20:14.433 --> 20:16.066
STATE LEGISLATURE TO STATE

20:16.133 --> 20:16.866
LEGISLATURE.

20:16.933 --> 20:19.866
AND THEY DID.

20:19.933 --> 20:20.933
JUST SIX YEARS LATER,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.300
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS HAD

20:22.366 --> 20:23.933
PASSED IN 22 STATES.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.866
AND WHILE, FOLLOWING THE KILLING

20:25.933 --> 20:26.766
OF TRAYVON MARTIN, THEY BECAME

20:26.833 --> 20:32.466
INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL,

20:32.533 --> 20:33.366
STATES DID NOT STOP PASSING THE

20:33.433 --> 20:34.033
LAWS -- THEY JUST SLIGHTLY

20:34.100 --> 20:34.433
SLOWED DOWN.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.600
AND DENNIS BAXLEY, ONE OF THE

20:35.666 --> 20:36.300
STATE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HELPED

20:36.366 --> 20:37.066
DRAFT FLORIDA'S BILL, WAS

20:37.133 --> 20:38.100
ADAMANT THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE

20:38.166 --> 20:39.200
ROLLED BACK.

20:39.266 --> 20:40.233
>> WE SHOULD STAND BESIDE

20:40.300 --> 20:42.500
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

20:42.566 --> 20:43.933
THEY SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A

20:44.000 --> 20:46.333
CRIMINAL IF THEY'RE DOING

20:46.400 --> 20:47.066
SOMETHING POSITIVE, WHICH IS

20:47.133 --> 20:48.866
STOPPING A VIOLENT ACT FROM

20:48.933 --> 20:49.566
OCCURRING.

20:49.633 --> 20:50.733
THERE ARE GONNA BE TIMES

20:50.800 --> 20:51.400
WITH CLOSE CALLS NEAR THE

20:51.466 --> 20:52.033
FOUL LINE -- IS IT IN OR IS IT

20:52.100 --> 20:52.433
OUT?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.400
WHO'S THE ASSAILANT AND WHO'S

20:53.466 --> 20:54.233
THE VICTIM?

20:54.300 --> 20:56.233
>> John: YEAH, THERE ARE GOING

20:56.300 --> 20:57.200
TO BE SOME CLOSE CALLS.

20:57.266 --> 20:57.833
IS IT IN OR IS IT OUT?

20:57.900 --> 20:59.333
IS IT RIGHT OR IS IT WRONG?

20:59.400 --> 21:00.800
IS IT SELF-DEFENSE OR IS IT A

21:00.866 --> 21:02.233
MURDER PROVOKED BY A DEBATE

21:02.300 --> 21:03.100
ABOUT HOW MUCH A DOG CAN WEIGH

21:03.166 --> 21:04.300
THAT TURNED PHYSICAL?

21:04.366 --> 21:06.366
WHO CAN SAY?

21:06.433 --> 21:09.900
NOT THAT GUY.

21:09.966 --> 21:11.366
AND THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF THE

21:11.433 --> 21:13.066
POINT HERE.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.066
THE WAY MOST STATES'

21:14.133 --> 21:14.700
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS

21:14.766 --> 21:15.733
ARE CONSTRUCTED, THEY CAN MAKE

21:15.800 --> 21:16.333
DETERMINING QUESTIONS OF GUILT

21:16.400 --> 21:17.500
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

21:17.566 --> 21:18.866
BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO

21:18.933 --> 21:20.433
PERCEIVED FEAR -- WHETHER YOU

21:20.500 --> 21:21.833
LEGITIMATELY SAW SOMEONE AS A

21:21.900 --> 21:22.433
THREAT -- AND THAT IS

21:22.500 --> 21:25.200
DEFINITIONALLY SUBJECTIVE.

21:25.266 --> 21:26.966
WHAT I'M AFRAID OF -- SNAKES,

21:27.033 --> 21:28.800
CLOWNS, AND TILDA SWINTON --

21:28.866 --> 21:30.433
JESUS CHRIST! -- MIGHT NOT BE

21:30.500 --> 21:34.266
WHAT YOU ARE.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.733
AND IT'S MADE EVEN HARDER BY THE

21:35.800 --> 21:44.100
FACT THAT OFTEN, THE ONLY OTHER

21:44.166 --> 21:45.633
PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED

21:45.700 --> 21:47.300
IN THE INCIDENT IS DEAD.

21:47.366 --> 21:48.933
AND CITING "STAND YOUR GROUND"

21:49.000 --> 21:50.666
AS A LEGAL DEFENSE HAS BEEN

21:50.733 --> 21:52.033
EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.066
IN FLORIDA ALONE, AS OF 2012,

21:53.133 --> 21:55.000
NEARLY 70% OF PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED

21:55.066 --> 21:56.300
IT AS A DEFENSE HAD GONE FREE.

21:56.366 --> 21:57.633
AND ADVOCATES FOR THESE LAWS

21:57.700 --> 21:58.900
WILL TELL YOU THAT'S A GOOD

21:58.966 --> 21:59.500
THING -- THAT BEFORE THEIR

21:59.566 --> 22:00.366
INTRODUCTION, GOOD PEOPLE WERE

22:00.433 --> 22:01.066
GETTING SENT TO JAIL ALL THE

22:01.133 --> 22:02.133
TIME SIMPLY FOR DEFENDING

22:02.200 --> 22:02.466
THEMSELVES.

22:02.533 --> 22:03.466
BUT THEY NEVER HAD MUCH IN THE

22:03.533 --> 22:04.133
WAY OF ACTUAL EVIDENCE FOR THAT

22:04.200 --> 22:04.733
BEYOND HYPOTHETICALS LIKE

22:04.800 --> 22:05.666
MARION HAMMER'S STORY ABOUT HOW

22:05.733 --> 22:07.200
SOMEONE SAID SHE COULD HAVE GONE

22:07.266 --> 22:09.233
TO JAIL, BUT CRUCIALLY, DIDN'T.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.533
SO STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
WEREN'T REALLY FIXING A PROBLEM

22:11.666 --> 22:14.266
THAT NEEDED SOLVING.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.200
AND THE DANGERS THEY POSED WERE

22:15.266 --> 22:16.566
PRETTY OBVIOUS TO SOME FROM THE

22:16.633 --> 22:18.366
START.

22:18.433 --> 22:20.766
WHEN GEORGIA WAS DEBATING A

22:20.833 --> 22:22.900
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW IN 2006, A

22:22.966 --> 22:24.000
LOCAL STATION ASKED PEOPLE IN

22:24.066 --> 22:24.600
THE STREET WHAT THEY THOUGHT.

22:24.666 --> 22:25.266
AND WATCH AS THEIR THIRD

22:25.333 --> 22:27.033
INTERVIEWEE REALIZES SOMETHING

22:27.100 --> 22:28.066
THE FIRST TWO DON'T.

22:28.133 --> 22:31.300
>> I THINK IT'LL LOWER CRIME,

22:31.366 --> 22:32.700
MYSELF.

22:32.766 --> 22:34.233
'CAUSE A PERSON'S GONNA AND

22:34.300 --> 22:35.133
TWICE ABOUT RUNNING UP ON A

22:35.200 --> 22:37.466
CITIZEN IF HE THINKS THAT

22:37.533 --> 22:38.133
CITIZEN'S ARMED.

22:38.200 --> 22:38.866
>> IF YOU FEEL YOUR LIFE'S IN

22:38.933 --> 22:39.500
DANGER, I THINK -- I THINK IT'S

22:39.566 --> 22:39.966
A GOOD -- A GOOD LAW.

22:40.033 --> 22:40.600
>> I THINK IT'S GONNA GET A LOT

22:40.666 --> 22:40.966
OF PEOPLE HURT.

22:41.033 --> 22:42.100
>> WHY'S THAT?

22:42.166 --> 22:43.433
>> WELL, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WALKED

22:43.500 --> 22:44.000
UP TO ME IN A PARKING LOT, I

22:44.066 --> 22:47.500
DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE.

22:47.566 --> 22:48.200
AND BY THIS LAW, IF I FELT THAT

22:48.266 --> 22:48.866
YOU THREATENED ME, I COULD HAVE

22:48.933 --> 22:49.433
JUST SHOT YOU RIGHT NOW.

22:49.500 --> 22:49.866
YOU KNOW?

22:49.933 --> 22:51.433
I CAN'T -- THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.633
>> John: YEAH, THAT LAST GUY IS

22:52.700 --> 22:54.000
COMPLETELY RIGHT.

22:54.066 --> 22:56.266
AND IN HINDSIGHT, MAYBE WE

22:56.333 --> 22:57.300
SHOULDN'T HAVE LISTENED TO THE

22:57.366 --> 22:58.133
MAN IN THE "PRIDE OF THE SOUTH"

22:58.200 --> 23:00.533
HAT, THAT, BY THE WAY, FEATURES

23:00.600 --> 23:01.900
A PORTRAIT OF ROBERT E. LEE OVER

23:01.966 --> 23:02.533
A CONFEDERATE FLAG.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.200
THAT HAT ALONE SHOULD HAVE

23:03.266 --> 23:03.700
IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFIED

23:03.766 --> 23:04.600
ANYTHING HE SAID.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.500
IT'S LIKE IF ANTHONY FAUCI WORE

23:06.566 --> 23:07.300
THIS BUCKET HAT THAT SAYS

23:07.366 --> 23:08.566
"DADDY" IN THE "SHREK" FONT.

23:08.633 --> 23:10.466
IF HE DID, YOU'D BE DUTY-BOUND

23:10.533 --> 23:15.300
TO IGNORE ANYTHING HE SAID.

23:15.366 --> 23:16.833
'CAUSE THE FACT IS, WE NOW

23:16.900 --> 23:17.833
KNOW, OVERALL, NOT ONLY DO

23:17.900 --> 23:18.933
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS NOT DETER

23:19.000 --> 23:20.200
CRIME, THEY MAY ACTUALLY

23:20.266 --> 23:22.533
INCREASE VIOLENCE.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.800
IN STAND-YOUR-GROUND STATES,

23:23.866 --> 23:27.600
HOMICIDES OVERALL HAVE INCREASED

23:27.666 --> 23:28.733
NEARLY 11% SINCE THE LAWS'

23:28.800 --> 23:30.166
ENACTMENT, WHEREAS IN STATES

23:30.233 --> 23:32.933
WITHOUT THOSE LAWS, THE HOMICIDE

23:33.000 --> 23:34.566
RATE WENT DOWN BY JUST OVER 2%.

23:34.633 --> 23:35.466
IN FACT, ANOTHER STUDY FOUND

23:35.533 --> 23:36.900
SUCH LAWS TRANSLATE INTO AN

23:36.966 --> 23:40.233
ADDITIONAL 600 HOMICIDES PER

23:40.300 --> 23:40.933
YEAR.

23:41.000 --> 23:41.866
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

23:41.933 --> 23:42.733
COME ON, YOU CAN'T DRAW A

23:42.800 --> 23:43.866
STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THESE

23:43.933 --> 23:45.200
SPECIFIC LAWS AND PEOPLE'S

23:45.266 --> 23:47.100
ACTIONS" -- IN SOME CASES, YOU

23:47.166 --> 23:48.366
VERY MUCH CAN, INCLUDING ONE OF

23:48.433 --> 23:49.600
THE VERY FIRST STAND-YOUR-GROUND

23:49.666 --> 23:51.800
CASES IN TEXAS, THAT OF JOE

23:51.866 --> 23:55.000
HORN, WHO CALLED 911 TO REPORT A

23:55.066 --> 23:56.266
BURGLARY HAPPENING DURING THE

23:56.333 --> 23:57.833
DAY AT HIS NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR'S

23:57.900 --> 23:59.033
HOUSE.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.900
>> I'VE GOT A SHOTGUN.

24:00.966 --> 24:02.633
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP HIM?

24:02.700 --> 24:04.333
>> NOPE, DON'T DO THAT.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.200
AIN'T NO PROPERTY WORTH SHOOTING

24:05.266 --> 24:06.966
SOMEBODY OVER, OKAY?

24:07.033 --> 24:08.400
>> JOE HORN SOUNDS CLEARLY

24:08.466 --> 24:12.433
UPSET.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.100
>> I AM NOT GONNA LET THEM GET

24:13.166 --> 24:13.733
AWAY WITH IT.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.500
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON GETTING

24:14.566 --> 24:15.000
KILLED OVER THIS, OKAY?

24:15.066 --> 24:16.966
>> NO.

24:17.033 --> 24:18.600
>> I'M GONNA SHOOT.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.966
>> GONNA SHOOT.

24:21.033 --> 24:21.600
>> BUT THE 911 DISPATCHER WARNS

24:21.666 --> 24:22.400
HORN TO STAY INSIDE AT LEAST A

24:22.466 --> 24:22.866
DOZEN SEPARATE TIMES.

24:22.933 --> 24:23.500
>> AN OFFICER IS COMING OUT

24:23.566 --> 24:24.600
THERE.

24:24.666 --> 24:26.166
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUTSIDE

24:26.233 --> 24:35.133
OF THAT HOUSE.

24:35.200 --> 24:35.733
>> THEN HORN, SOUNDING ANGRIER

24:35.800 --> 24:36.300
BY THE MOMENT, CITES THE NEW

24:36.366 --> 24:37.366
TEXAS LAW.

24:37.433 --> 24:38.100
>> I HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT

24:38.166 --> 24:38.600
MYSELF TOO, SIR AND YOU

24:38.666 --> 24:39.100
UNDERSTAND THAT.

24:39.166 --> 24:39.866
>> YES, YOU DO.

24:39.933 --> 24:40.166
YES, YOU DO.

24:40.233 --> 24:40.733
>> AND THE LAWS HAVE BEEN

24:40.800 --> 24:41.333
CHANGED IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
SEPTEMBER THE 1ST AND YOU KNOW

24:42.466 --> 24:43.033
IT AND I KNOW IT.

24:43.100 --> 24:43.833
>> John: YEAH, JOE HORN KNEW

24:43.900 --> 24:44.466
WHAT THE LAWS SAID, AND DESPITE

24:44.533 --> 24:45.066
THE DISPATCHER WARNING HIM NOT

24:45.133 --> 24:47.233
TO GO OUTSIDE 14 TIMES, HE DID

24:47.300 --> 24:48.833
JUST THAT AND KILLED TWO PEOPLE,

24:48.900 --> 24:50.400
WITH AUTOPSY REPORTS LATER

24:50.466 --> 24:51.633
SHOWING THAT BOTH MEN APPEARED

24:51.700 --> 24:54.200
TO HAVE BEEN SHOT IN THE BACK.

24:54.266 --> 24:55.900
HE WAS EXPLICITLY TOLD THAT

24:55.966 --> 24:56.933
PROPERTY IS NOT WORTH SHOOTING

24:57.000 --> 24:59.766
PEOPLE OVER.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.200
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TRUE.

25:02.266 --> 25:03.966
AND CERTAINLY NOT YOUR

25:04.033 --> 25:06.300
NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY.

25:06.366 --> 25:09.033
IF I FOUND OUT MY NEIGHBOR SHOT

25:09.100 --> 25:10.400
AND KILLED TWO PEOPLE TO SAVE MY

25:10.466 --> 25:11.800
PS5, I WOULD MOVE TOMORROW.

25:11.866 --> 25:12.600
I KNOW THEY'RE HARD TO GET YOUR

25:12.666 --> 25:13.800
HANDS ON, BUT JESUS CHRIST, CALM

25:13.866 --> 25:15.766
DOWN.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.733
I DON'T WANT YOUR BLOOD CONSOLE.

25:17.800 --> 25:23.633
AND THANKS TO TEXAS' NEW

25:23.700 --> 25:24.600
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS, JOE HORN

25:24.666 --> 25:25.200
WAS NEVER ARRESTED.

25:25.266 --> 25:25.866
AND ULTIMATELY, A GRAND JURY

25:25.933 --> 25:26.633
DECLINED TO EVER CHARGE HIM WITH

25:26.700 --> 25:27.766
A CRIME.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.833
AND NOT ONLY WAS HORN SPARED ANY

25:29.900 --> 25:31.933
CONSEQUENCES, HE WAS LATER

25:32.000 --> 25:33.566
CELEBRATED AS A HERO.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.533
>> YOU HAD 911 ON AND YOU SAID,

25:34.600 --> 25:35.066
I'M GONNA GO STOP THEM.

25:35.133 --> 25:35.666
YOU GOTTA GET HERE, I'M GONNA

25:35.733 --> 25:35.966
STOP THEM.

25:36.033 --> 25:36.600
THEY SAID, NO, NO, NO, DON'T GO

25:36.666 --> 25:37.166
OUT.

25:37.233 --> 25:38.733
YOU -- YOU STOPPED THEM.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.766
THEY CAME TOWARDS YOU.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.066
YOU SHOT THEM, RIGHT?

25:41.133 --> 25:41.533
>> YES, SIR.

25:41.600 --> 25:47.233
THAT'S CORRECT.

25:47.300 --> 25:47.766
[CHEERING]

25:47.833 --> 25:48.633
>> John: OKAY.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.233
SET ASIDE THAT JOE HORN LOOKS

25:50.300 --> 25:51.400
LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

25:51.466 --> 25:52.033
BOBBY HILL GREW UP AND SUCKED.

25:52.100 --> 25:52.666
THE ONLY TIME IT'S APPROPRIATE

25:52.733 --> 25:53.266
TO CHEER AFTER SOMEONE SAYS "YOU

25:53.333 --> 25:53.900
SHOT THEM" IS IF YOU'RE TALKING

25:53.966 --> 25:54.533
ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE

25:54.600 --> 25:55.833
FOR SHOOTING THIS VIDEO OF A

25:55.900 --> 25:56.700
FAMILY OF BEARS IN A SWIMMING

25:56.766 --> 25:57.900
POOL.

25:57.966 --> 25:59.000
QUESTION: "YOU SAW THE BEARS,

25:59.066 --> 26:00.400
YOU HAD YOUR PHONE READY, AND

26:00.466 --> 26:02.200
YOU SHOT THEM, RIGHT?"

26:02.266 --> 26:02.733
ANSWER: "YES, SIR, THAT'S

26:02.800 --> 26:05.766
CORRECT."

26:05.833 --> 26:06.366
CUE THE FUCKING APPLAUSE.

26:06.433 --> 26:07.500
NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.233
NONE.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.466
AND IF THESE LAWS ON THEIR OWN

26:09.533 --> 26:11.866
WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH, THERE IS NOW

26:11.933 --> 26:13.800
ALSO A SMALL COTTAGE INDUSTRY

26:13.866 --> 26:15.633
THAT'S CROPPED UP AROUND THEM

26:15.700 --> 26:17.900
SELLING SPECIALIZED SELF-DEFENSE

26:17.966 --> 26:19.866
LEGAL ASSISTANCE.

26:19.933 --> 26:21.033
MOST OF THESE COMPANIES OFFER

26:21.100 --> 26:21.733
MEMBERSHIP PACKAGES INCLUDING

26:21.800 --> 26:22.300
EVERYTHING FROM EDUCATIONAL

26:22.366 --> 26:22.866
TRAINING VIDEOS TO MONEY FOR

26:22.933 --> 26:24.733
FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE AND BOND.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.533
THE U.S. CONCEALED CARRY

26:25.600 --> 26:26.600
ASSOCIATION INSISTS IT'S

26:26.666 --> 26:28.166
PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH

26:28.233 --> 26:29.166
TEACHING CONFLICT AVOIDANCE, BUT

26:29.233 --> 26:30.800
IT ALSO GIVES YOU A WALLET-SIZED

26:30.866 --> 26:31.966
CARD WITH TIPS ON HOW TO HANDLE

26:32.033 --> 26:34.433
THE CALL YOU MAKE TO POLICE

26:34.500 --> 26:36.033
AFTER YOU'VE SHOT SOMEONE, A

26:36.100 --> 26:37.433
HANDY FEATURE THEIR FOUNDER

26:37.500 --> 26:40.300
PROUDLY TOUTS TO MEMBERS.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.333
>> THIS IS MY VERY OWN USCCA

26:42.400 --> 26:42.866
CARD.

26:42.933 --> 26:43.600
YOU CAN SEE MY NAME ON IT,

26:43.666 --> 26:44.766
TIM SCHMIDT, RIGHT ON THE BACK

26:44.833 --> 26:46.133
OF THE CARD.

26:46.200 --> 26:46.833
IT ACTUALLY LISTS THE EXACT

26:46.900 --> 26:47.700
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHAT TO SAY TO

26:47.766 --> 26:49.166
A RESPONDING OFFICER.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.066
EXPLAIN I WAS ATTACKED, I FEARED

26:51.133 --> 26:51.866
FOR MY LIFE, AND I HAD TO DEFEND

26:51.933 --> 26:53.566
MYSELF.

26:53.633 --> 26:54.966
>> John: OKAY, SETTING ASIDE THE

26:55.033 --> 26:56.200
FACT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE MOST

26:56.266 --> 26:59.133
BORING EPISODE OF "SPORTSCENTER"

26:59.200 --> 27:00.533
IMAGINABLE, IT FEELS IMPORTANT

27:00.600 --> 27:01.333
TO POINT OUT THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY

27:01.400 --> 27:02.600
CREATED A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE

27:02.666 --> 27:03.366
CARD.

27:03.433 --> 27:04.566
AND THAT MIXED WITH THAT MAN'S

27:04.633 --> 27:07.566
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE COMPLEXION

27:07.633 --> 27:09.700
IS A PRETTY AWFUL COMBINATION.

27:09.766 --> 27:11.700
AND AT LEAST ONE OF USCCA'S

27:11.766 --> 27:12.900
CLIENTS APPARENTLY TOOK THE

27:12.966 --> 27:13.866
ADVICE ON THAT CARD AND RAN WITH

27:13.933 --> 27:15.233
IT:

27:15.300 --> 27:17.300
>> CARLOS GARCIA'S EX-WIFE,

27:17.366 --> 27:19.100
YAILEEN AYALA, PAINTS HIM AS A

27:19.166 --> 27:20.066
LOVING FATHER WHO WOULD DO

27:20.133 --> 27:22.833
ANYTHING FOR HIS CHILDREN.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.200
SHE BELIEVES HE WAS INTOXICATED

27:24.266 --> 27:25.233
WHEN HE SHOWED UP TO PICK UP HIS

27:25.300 --> 27:26.900
KIDS AND GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT

27:26.966 --> 27:28.366
WITH THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,

27:28.433 --> 27:29.666
NICK JULIAN IV, OVER HIM PLAYING

27:29.733 --> 27:32.233
LOUD MUSIC IN THE CAR.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.833
JULIAN ARMED HIMSELF WITH A

27:35.900 --> 27:37.466
HANDGUN AND SHOT GARCIA, HE

27:37.533 --> 27:39.433
CLAIMS IN SELF-DEFENSE.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.333
NEIGHBORS CAME OUT AS JULIAN IV

27:40.400 --> 27:43.133
WAS ON WITH 911.

27:43.200 --> 27:43.933
>> 911, WHAT IS YOUR

27:44.000 --> 27:45.066
EMERGENCY?

27:45.133 --> 27:46.100
>> YES, MA'AM, I JUST HAD A MAN

27:46.166 --> 27:49.400
ATTACK ME IN MY FRONT YARD.

27:49.466 --> 27:50.333
HE ATTACKED ME AND I HAD TO USE

27:50.400 --> 27:52.733
FORCE.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.066
I WAS AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.

27:54.133 --> 27:55.100
>> John: YEAH, IT SEEMS ALL YOU

27:55.166 --> 27:56.233
HAVE TO DO IS MEMORIZE A FEW KEY

27:56.300 --> 27:58.533
PHRASES AND YOU TOO COULD BE

27:58.600 --> 27:59.666
FREE TO SHOOT WITH IMPUNITY.

27:59.733 --> 28:00.866
IT'S BASICALLY ROSETTA STONE FOR

28:00.933 --> 28:02.600
JUSTIFIED HOMICIDES, BECAUSE

28:02.666 --> 28:03.833
DURING HIS 911 CALL, NICK JULIAN

28:03.900 --> 28:05.500
MADE SURE TO SAY THAT HE FEARED

28:05.566 --> 28:07.933
FOR HIS LIFE THREE SEPARATE

28:08.000 --> 28:10.033
TIMES AND CAN ALSO BE HEARD

28:10.100 --> 28:11.100
REFERRING TO HIS WALLET AND

28:11.166 --> 28:12.833
SAYING TO SOMEONE, "YOU JUST

28:12.900 --> 28:14.866
NEED TO CALL THEM, GIVE THEM THE

28:14.933 --> 28:16.666
ACCOUNT NUMBER AND MY ATTORNEY."

28:16.733 --> 28:18.033
AND BY THE TIME THE POLICE

28:18.100 --> 28:20.300
ARRIVED, HE WAS ALREADY ON THE

28:20.366 --> 28:21.466
PHONE WITH THE U.S. CONCEALED

28:21.533 --> 28:26.133
CARRY ASSOCIATION SETTING UP HIS

28:26.200 --> 28:28.233
LEGAL DEFENSE BEFORE HIS VICTIM

28:28.300 --> 28:29.466
HAD EVEN BEEN DECLARED DEAD.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.633
AND I KNOW IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE

28:30.700 --> 28:31.633
THESE LAWS ARE JUST A

28:31.700 --> 28:32.233
FREE-FOR-ALL TO SHOOT SOMEONE

28:32.300 --> 28:33.000
WHO SCARES YOU.

28:33.066 --> 28:34.700
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE SOME

28:34.766 --> 28:35.833
LIMITS.

28:35.900 --> 28:36.900
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHERE THIS

28:36.966 --> 28:38.100
IS GOING.

28:38.166 --> 28:38.966
BECAUSE WHILE MOST SHOOTINGS

28:39.033 --> 28:39.633
INVOLVE PEOPLE OF THE SAME RACE,

28:39.700 --> 28:40.533
WHEN CASES INVOLVE SHOOTINGS

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
ACROSS RACIAL LINES, THERE ARE

28:41.666 --> 28:43.166
SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN WHOSE

28:43.233 --> 28:44.000
FEAR GETS BELIEVED.

28:44.066 --> 28:46.233
BECAUSE THE ODDS A

28:46.300 --> 28:49.866
WHITE-ON-BLACK HOMICIDE WAS

28:49.933 --> 28:51.333
DEEMED JUSTIFIED BY THE POLICE

28:51.400 --> 28:52.766
WERE 281% GREATER THAN THE ODDS

28:52.833 --> 28:54.600
A WHITE-ON-WHITE HOMICIDE WAS.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.433
AND THE EXPANSION OF

28:57.500 --> 28:59.033
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS HAVE

28:59.100 --> 28:59.733
APPEARED TO WORSEN THAT

28:59.800 --> 29:00.833
DISPARITY, A FACT THAT I'M

29:00.900 --> 29:01.833
PRETTY SURE WOULD SURPRISE

29:01.900 --> 29:03.966
EXACTLY TWO OF THESE THREE MEN.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.533
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THERE ARE

29:06.600 --> 29:07.100
MULTIPLE EXAMPLES WHERE YOU

29:07.166 --> 29:07.966
WOULD THINK, IF EVER A

29:08.033 --> 29:09.966
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW WOULD

29:10.033 --> 29:11.666
APPLY, THIS WOULD BE THE CASE --

29:11.733 --> 29:13.633
AND YET, IT DIDN'T.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.833
TAKE SIWATU-SALAMA RA, WHO WAVED

29:15.900 --> 29:17.166
AN UNLOADED, REGISTERED GUN AT A

29:17.233 --> 29:19.066
WOMAN WHO SHE BELIEVED WAS

29:19.133 --> 29:21.333
TRYING TO HIT HER AND HER YOUNG

29:21.400 --> 29:25.066
DAUGHTER WITH HER CAR.

29:25.133 --> 29:27.100
BUT EVEN THOUGH HER STATE OF

29:27.166 --> 29:28.500
MICHIGAN HAS A STAND-YOUR-GROUND

29:28.566 --> 29:30.400
LAW, AND EVEN THOUGH THAT

29:30.466 --> 29:31.333
INCIDENT CLEARLY FALLS UNDER A

29:31.400 --> 29:32.100
REASONABLE DEFINITION OF

29:32.166 --> 29:32.666
SELF-DEFENSE WITHOUT IT, AND

29:32.733 --> 29:33.566
EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T EVEN

29:33.633 --> 29:34.200
SHOOT THE GUN BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT

29:34.266 --> 29:35.600
WAS UNLOADED, SHE WAS

29:35.666 --> 29:37.100
SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS ON THE

29:37.166 --> 29:38.733
CHARGE OF USING A GUN TO COMMIT

29:38.800 --> 29:40.100
A FELONY.

29:40.166 --> 29:41.566
AND WHILE, AFTER OUTCRY, SHE

29:41.633 --> 29:42.866
WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO PLEAD TO

29:42.933 --> 29:43.800
A LESSER CHARGE, THAT WASN'T

29:43.866 --> 29:44.833
BEFORE SHE'D SPENT A YEAR IN

29:44.900 --> 29:45.866
PRISON.

29:45.933 --> 29:47.466
AND SHE WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME

29:47.533 --> 29:48.833
AND WAS FORCED TO BIRTH IN

29:48.900 --> 29:50.900
SHACKLES.

29:50.966 --> 29:52.466
SO DESPITE BEING INTRODUCED TO

29:52.533 --> 29:53.800
INCREASE SAFETY,

29:53.866 --> 29:55.633
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS ACTUALLY

29:55.700 --> 29:57.666
INCREASE VIOLENCE.

29:57.733 --> 29:59.233
AND GIVEN AROUND FOUR CENTURIES

29:59.300 --> 30:00.933
OF HISTORY, BASING A LAW AROUND

30:01.000 --> 30:03.133
"WHO'S AFRAID OF WHO" WAS ALWAYS

30:03.200 --> 30:05.766
GOING TO BE DANGEROUS.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.366
IT'S THE REASON OHIO STATE

30:07.433 --> 30:08.366
LEGISLATOR STEPHANIE HOWSE STOOD

30:08.433 --> 30:10.000
UP TO OPPOSE HER STATE PASSING

30:10.066 --> 30:11.466
ITS STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW BACK

30:11.533 --> 30:13.066
IN 2018:

30:13.133 --> 30:15.533
>> WHEN YOUR PRESENCE, WHEN YOUR

30:15.600 --> 30:18.866
BEING, YOUR BLACKNESS CAUSES

30:18.933 --> 30:20.333
FEAR -- DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M

30:20.400 --> 30:22.033
SAYING?

30:22.100 --> 30:23.966
I'VE BEEN IN THESE -- THESE

30:24.033 --> 30:26.066
FLOORS WHERE I HEAR PEOPLE TELL

30:26.133 --> 30:27.600
ME, "YOU KNOW PEOPLE SCARED OF

30:27.666 --> 30:31.566
YOU."

30:31.633 --> 30:33.666
IT'S PEOPLE I HAVE NEVER

30:33.733 --> 30:35.300
INTERACTED WITH.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.166
WHAT DO YOU DO IN PLACES AND

30:37.233 --> 30:40.266
SPACES WHEN YOUR PRESENCE --

30:40.333 --> 30:41.900
LITERALLY YOUR FACE, YOUR FACE

30:41.966 --> 30:42.600
CAUSES SOMEONE TO BE FEARFUL OF

30:42.666 --> 30:43.366
YOU?

30:43.433 --> 30:44.266
THIS IS A BAD IDEA FOR PEOPLE

30:44.333 --> 30:46.833
THAT LOOK LIKE ME.

30:46.900 --> 30:47.966
>> John: EXACTLY.

30:48.033 --> 30:49.400
THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS

30:49.466 --> 30:50.466
THAT MAKES THESE LAWS SO

30:50.533 --> 30:51.400
DANGEROUS.

30:51.466 --> 30:53.100
THEY CAN EXALT A WHITE PERSON'S

30:53.166 --> 30:55.400
FEAR OVER A BLACK PERSON'S LIFE

30:55.466 --> 30:57.300
AND ARE APPLIED SO UNEVENLY THAT

30:57.366 --> 30:58.433
SIWATU-SALAMA RA GAVE BIRTH IN

30:58.500 --> 30:59.733
SHACKLES WHILE THIS GUY GETS A

30:59.800 --> 31:02.866
FUCKING PARADE.

31:02.933 --> 31:04.466
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS HAVE

31:04.533 --> 31:06.266
CONTRIBUTED TO A SOCIETY WHERE

31:06.333 --> 31:07.733
VIGILANTES WITH GUNS FEEL THEY

31:07.800 --> 31:09.100
HAVE TO RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT IS

31:09.166 --> 31:09.966
SAFETY, WHO IS A THREAT, AND

31:10.033 --> 31:11.033
WHAT THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.900
THEY'VE TURBO-CHARGED EVERYTHING

31:12.966 --> 31:14.200
FROM ROAD-RAGE INCIDENTS TO

31:14.266 --> 31:15.933
POINTLESS DISPUTES OVER DOG

31:16.000 --> 31:21.266
WEIGHTS.

31:21.333 --> 31:22.733
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

31:22.800 --> 31:23.333
WELL, THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY

31:23.400 --> 31:23.933
PRETTY SIMPLE.

31:24.000 --> 31:24.833
DON'T PASS ANY MORE

31:24.900 --> 31:25.500
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS AND

31:25.566 --> 31:27.300
REPEAL THE ONES THAT DO EXIST.

31:27.366 --> 31:28.233
THEY'RE REDUNDANT SOLUTIONS TO A

31:28.300 --> 31:29.333
MADE-UP PROBLEM, AND THEY'RE

31:29.400 --> 31:31.600
ACTIVELY DOING HARM.

31:31.666 --> 31:32.800
IN THE PAST YEAR, AT LEAST 14

31:32.866 --> 31:34.400
BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN

31:34.466 --> 31:35.600
FIVE STATES TO ROLL THEIR

31:35.666 --> 31:36.900
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS BACK.

31:36.966 --> 31:38.200
AND IF YOU LIVE IN A

31:38.266 --> 31:39.566
STAND-YOUR-GROUND STATE,

31:39.633 --> 31:40.800
ESPECIALLY ONE WHERE THOSE BILLS

31:40.866 --> 31:43.366
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED, YOU SHOULD

31:43.433 --> 31:46.033
ABSOLUTELY WRITE TO YOUR

31:46.100 --> 31:47.300
REPRESENTATIVES TO URGE THEM TO

31:47.366 --> 31:49.733
REPEAL THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.833
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, IF YOU

31:51.900 --> 31:52.733
LIVE IN FLORIDA -- OR, FUCK IT,

31:52.800 --> 31:55.000
ANY STATE -- IN THE INTERESTS OF

31:55.066 --> 31:56.266
ANNOYING MARION HAMMER, MAYBE

31:56.333 --> 32:00.033
ALSO DEMAND THEY MAKE YOUR STATE

32:00.100 --> 32:00.800
BIRD THE FLORIDA SCRUB JAY, SO

32:00.866 --> 32:01.666
IT CAN DELIVER ITS FERGILICIOUS

32:01.733 --> 32:03.100
VICTORY SONG.

32:03.166 --> 32:06.766
[BIRD CHIRPING]

32:06.833 --> 32:12.066
THAT'S A B-PLUS BIRD.

32:12.133 --> 32:12.833
THAT BIRD IS FINE.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.733
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.300
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

32:15.366 --> 32:15.933
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

32:16.033 --> 32:17.333
GOOD NIGHT.

32:17.400 --> 32:25.033
[BIRD CHIRPING]
