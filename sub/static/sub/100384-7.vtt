WEBVTT

00:02.508 --> 00:06.123
I've got convertibles,
I've got roadsters,

00:06.148 --> 00:09.264
I've got pickups, sedans, minivans,

00:09.289 --> 00:11.058
and everything in between.

00:11.083 --> 00:13.757
You want whitewalls? I got 'em.

00:13.782 --> 00:16.524
You want Bonnie and Clyde's getaway car?

00:16.549 --> 00:17.680
I got it.

00:17.721 --> 00:19.425
The only thing I don't got

00:19.450 --> 00:21.723
is a talent for negotiation.

00:21.809 --> 00:23.424
So make me an offer.

00:23.449 --> 00:25.690
I promise you're gonna
get the best of me.

00:25.715 --> 00:27.620
Remember, my motto is

00:27.645 --> 00:31.523
"Happy Stan's... all deals and no bull!"

00:31.723 --> 00:32.861
You ready?

00:32.886 --> 00:34.417
I'm gonna ask you one last time, okay?

00:34.442 --> 00:35.628
Let's keep him in the trailer.

00:35.653 --> 00:37.143
Let... let people peek
in from the sides.

00:37.168 --> 00:38.667
This isn't a damn zoo.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.762
Malachi's a star.

00:40.787 --> 00:43.442
They don't see him, they're
gonna think I'm full of crap.

00:43.624 --> 00:45.559
The worst thing for a used-car salesman

00:45.584 --> 00:48.081
is if his customers think
he's full of crap.

00:50.397 --> 00:51.751
Whoa!

01:00.006 --> 01:01.697
All right. Whoa, whoa.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.456
All right, everybody,
now keep your distance.

01:03.490 --> 01:04.769
This here's Malachi.

01:04.795 --> 01:06.092
He's a world-class bucking bull,

01:06.117 --> 01:07.496
almost 2, 000 pounds.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.848
Said to be the most dangerous
bull in the rodeo today,

01:09.873 --> 01:13.348
seeing how he's bucked off
more people than Bodacious.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.106
So just got your license, eh, son?

01:15.131 --> 01:16.184
This morning.

01:16.209 --> 01:17.708
Well, you got one heck of a pop

01:17.733 --> 01:19.613
to be buying you a car right away.

01:19.855 --> 01:21.157
Hop in.

01:21.563 --> 01:23.676
Start her up. Let's see how she drives.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.330
All right. Turn her over.

01:36.115 --> 01:37.727
Holy hell.

02:18.536 --> 02:19.987
Okay, ma'am. Try to stay calm for me.

02:20.012 --> 02:21.191
What's your location?

02:21.216 --> 02:22.510
Happy Stan's.

02:22.535 --> 02:23.928
Happy Stan's Rodeo?

02:24.009 --> 02:26.222
Happy Stan's Used Car Lot.

02:35.213 --> 02:36.432
I don't see a bull.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.324
Oh, that can't be a good thing.

02:38.349 --> 02:40.263
All right, move the wounded to safety.

02:40.288 --> 02:42.769
Watch your backs. This
bull's still on the loose.

02:42.794 --> 02:44.447
TK. Why don't you call dispatch?

02:44.472 --> 02:46.241
See if anybody has eyes on him.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.030
Let's grab some axes, just in case.

02:48.055 --> 02:49.467
Oh, yeah, that's gonna do a lot of good

02:49.492 --> 02:51.705
against a 3, 000-pound charging beast.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.311
What kind of reckless
idiot brings a rodeo bull

02:55.336 --> 02:57.418
into a car lot in the first place?

02:57.556 --> 02:59.045
Happy Stan.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.959
That's Happy Stan?

03:00.984 --> 03:02.468
I recognize him from the commercials.

03:02.493 --> 03:03.873
Yeah, well, he don't look too happy now.

03:03.898 --> 03:05.514
Dispatch can't get us a 20 on the bull,

03:05.539 --> 03:07.687
but they're urging us
to use extreme caution.

03:07.712 --> 03:08.788
Excellent.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.850
I need you to move your hands
so I can pack this wound

03:10.875 --> 03:12.746
and we can get you to
the hospital, okay?

03:12.771 --> 03:13.859
It hurts.

03:14.181 --> 03:15.563
See a bull run by?

03:15.588 --> 03:17.106
Follow the trail.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.307
Good idea.

03:28.779 --> 03:29.866
Axes up.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.588
TK, call Animal Control.
Give 'em our location.

03:41.613 --> 03:42.921
Poor thing.

03:42.946 --> 03:44.849
APB, we're at Stan's Used Car Lot.

03:44.874 --> 03:46.384
We got a...

03:47.113 --> 03:49.680
we got a bull in a car.

03:55.921 --> 03:57.473
With all the blood he’s lost,

03:57.498 --> 03:58.835
that should hit him pretty quick,

03:58.860 --> 04:00.110
but y'all be careful.

04:00.135 --> 04:02.882
An injured animal spooks easy,
even with the tranquilizer.

04:02.907 --> 04:04.773
Believe me, nobody wants that.

04:04.798 --> 04:06.257
Oh, we believe you.

04:06.282 --> 04:08.046
All right, so no sudden movements,

04:08.071 --> 04:09.171
keep our voices down.

04:09.196 --> 04:11.218
Let's do this as quickly
and quietly as we can.

04:11.243 --> 04:12.243
No saws.

04:12.268 --> 04:14.047
I don't want anything
that could put a spark

04:14.072 --> 04:15.255
into our friend here.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.319
TK, Marjan, you're on the
battery-operated jaws,

04:17.344 --> 04:19.163
and somebody make sure
medical's standing by.

04:19.188 --> 04:20.918
- For the bull?
- For us.

04:32.501 --> 04:35.184
Hey, Malachi. How you doing?

04:36.087 --> 04:39.811
I've rescued cats from trees
and dogs from storm drains,

04:39.836 --> 04:41.940
but this is a first.

04:43.338 --> 04:45.402
Yeah, there's no two ways about it.

04:45.491 --> 04:47.276
This sucks, but I promise you,

04:47.301 --> 04:49.110
we're gonna get you out, all right?

04:49.135 --> 04:50.150
So I would appreciate

04:50.175 --> 04:52.576
if you didn't kill any of my team.

04:52.768 --> 04:54.466
Good?

04:54.822 --> 04:56.041
TK, Marjan.

05:01.422 --> 05:02.961
There we go.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.082
Shh, it's okay.

05:04.107 --> 05:05.587
You're doing so good.

05:08.969 --> 05:11.250
You good, Cap?

05:11.275 --> 05:12.587
Just be easy.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.809
All right, everybody calm. Don't move.

05:18.422 --> 05:21.121
Shh. I know.

05:21.381 --> 05:22.774
I know how it feels

05:22.799 --> 05:24.579
to feel like everything's out of control

05:24.604 --> 05:25.915
and spinning around

05:25.940 --> 05:27.692
and you don't know how you got yourself

05:27.717 --> 05:29.227
into this situation in the first place.

05:29.252 --> 05:30.835
I've been there.

05:31.405 --> 05:32.954
There right now, actually.

05:35.479 --> 05:36.698
Keep going.

05:36.723 --> 05:38.204
- Dad, you sure?
- I'm sure.

05:38.229 --> 05:39.540
Yeah, I'm sure. Keep going.

06:08.646 --> 06:10.082
All right, Judd.

06:37.338 --> 06:39.683
There, I told you we'd
get you out of there.

06:40.405 --> 06:42.727
Hey, Malachi, next time, do me a favor.

06:43.021 --> 06:44.605
Pick a convertible.

06:44.630 --> 06:47.106
That was a nice little
speech you had back there.

06:47.467 --> 06:48.613
Yeah.

06:48.638 --> 06:50.777
Well, I think he was
pretty zonked out on meds.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.477
Nah.

06:52.601 --> 06:54.697
No, he knew it was from the heart.

07:09.347 --> 07:10.815
It's not too heavy?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.666
I'm getting a hernia
just looking at you.

07:12.691 --> 07:14.025
No, I'm good. Come on, let's go.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.410
Okay, so on the day,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.191
Austin FD gives us 10
minutes and 20 seconds

07:17.223 --> 07:18.324
to run the course.

07:18.349 --> 07:20.525
I'll do it in 9. Set the timer.

07:20.557 --> 07:22.517
All right, just don't
kill yourself, all right?

07:22.868 --> 07:24.811
Three, two, one.

07:36.477 --> 07:39.160
Dad, you got this. Come on.

07:46.755 --> 07:48.066
Here we go, Dad. Come on.

07:55.331 --> 07:58.029
All right, that's 12 flights.

07:58.066 --> 07:59.804
- All right.
- Next station, come on.

08:02.151 --> 08:03.420
Yeah!

08:07.427 --> 08:08.667
You good?

08:13.412 --> 08:15.218
See you on the other side.

08:19.435 --> 08:21.074
There we go, there we go, there we go.

08:31.152 --> 08:33.462
All right, Dad.

08:33.517 --> 08:35.051
Come on, Dad. Last step.

08:40.068 --> 08:41.386
There we go.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.847
Come on, Dad.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.558
There it is.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.677
Dad? Dad?

08:53.702 --> 08:55.068
Hey. Hey, hey.

08:55.093 --> 08:57.237
Hey, hey. Dad, you okay?

08:57.564 --> 08:59.072
- Was I on pace?
- What?

08:59.097 --> 09:00.566
Was I on pace for under 10?

09:00.591 --> 09:02.918
You were at 13:22 when you passed out.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.537
That is less than ideal.

09:05.882 --> 09:08.711
We're gonna get my time under 10 minutes

09:08.736 --> 09:11.832
with slightly less passing out.

09:11.898 --> 09:14.409
Maybe I should get off
of my chemo just...

09:14.434 --> 09:16.480
No, no. Absolutely not.

09:16.533 --> 09:19.676
If I do not crush this test
and show the department

09:19.701 --> 09:21.746
that the cancer’s not slowing me down,

09:21.947 --> 09:24.140
they will hand the 126

09:24.366 --> 09:27.141
off to that smug bastard Billy Tyson.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.602
Yeah, thanks to Judd.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.160
It's not Judd's fault.

09:30.185 --> 09:31.566
I know, I'm just pissed

09:31.591 --> 09:33.169
that he introduced you to that guy.

09:33.236 --> 09:35.108
Billy would've been
coming for me anyway.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.300
You just had to play golf
with him, didn't you?

09:37.325 --> 09:39.780
- Well, you don't play with me.
- Yeah, but I can learn.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.280
Look...

09:41.989 --> 09:43.755
I promise you no matter what happens,

09:43.780 --> 09:45.427
even if I lose the house,

09:45.452 --> 09:47.300
I'm not gonna uproot you again.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.848
Dad, it's not about me.

09:48.998 --> 09:50.874
Well, it is a little bit, but...

09:51.607 --> 09:53.191
it's because I'm on your crew.

09:53.216 --> 09:54.857
And that's all I care about.

09:54.882 --> 09:56.884
I mean, even this test,
it's as much for them

09:56.909 --> 09:58.562
as it is for the department.

09:58.863 --> 10:00.038
They need to have confidence

10:00.063 --> 10:01.926
that their captain’s up to the job.

10:02.098 --> 10:04.036
Now that they know everything.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.326
But they don't know everything.

10:05.351 --> 10:06.735
You... you told them about the cancer,

10:06.760 --> 10:08.402
you told them about Billy,
but they didn't know

10:08.427 --> 10:09.832
that this stupid test was your idea.

10:09.857 --> 10:11.293
Yeah, I'm not sure how much confidence

10:11.318 --> 10:12.431
that would've instilled.

10:12.456 --> 10:13.740
Yeah, tell me about it.

10:13.765 --> 10:15.680
Come on. Let's go again.

10:16.482 --> 10:17.942
Grab my helmet.

10:20.490 --> 10:23.166
Listen, I feel for the guy. I do.

10:23.191 --> 10:25.366
I mean, what do you even say
to someone who got cancer

10:25.391 --> 10:27.263
from being at Ground
Zero on September 11th?

10:27.288 --> 10:28.654
"Thank you"?

10:28.679 --> 10:30.664
Well, yes, of course.

10:30.689 --> 10:32.608
I just wish he would've
told us sooner is all.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.091
He told us when he was ready.

10:34.116 --> 10:36.280
Okay, then I wish he was ready
before he had hired us.

10:36.305 --> 10:38.089
Well, in fairness, I
think that he found out

10:38.114 --> 10:40.377
about the diagnosis just right
before he left New York,

10:40.402 --> 10:42.444
so he was still coming to terms.

10:42.469 --> 10:43.818
And how would you know that?

10:44.124 --> 10:45.304
'Cause he told me.

10:46.137 --> 10:47.811
Oh, Great.

10:47.836 --> 10:49.921
So he tells the one guy who
didn't have to relocate

10:49.946 --> 10:51.194
his entire life down to Austin.

10:51.219 --> 10:52.438
Look, we're here now.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.851
Let's just focus on the positive

10:53.876 --> 10:55.905
and help Cap in any way we can.

10:55.930 --> 10:58.191
Hey, I am all for supporting
the captain, all right?

10:58.216 --> 10:59.818
It's not about the cancer.

10:59.843 --> 11:02.570
It's about this test that he is
never gonna be able to pass,

11:02.595 --> 11:04.577
and if this Billy bud gets
the keys to the kingdom,

11:04.602 --> 11:06.038
you know he's gonna clean house.

11:06.063 --> 11:08.226
Whoa, hang on a minute.
Man, you don't know that.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.788
Look, he and the captain don't
approach things the same way,

11:10.813 --> 11:12.413
but Billy ain't a bad guy.

11:12.518 --> 11:14.421
He ain't gonna come through
here with a scythe

11:14.446 --> 11:16.117
just 'cause we ain't his people.

11:18.234 --> 11:19.671
What?

11:20.529 --> 11:21.756
"We"?

11:22.718 --> 11:24.468
I mean, man, you ain't just his people.

11:24.493 --> 11:25.851
You are his people people.

11:25.876 --> 11:27.335
What does that mean?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.718
It just means that you're in the club.

11:29.743 --> 11:31.179
- I'm in the club?
- Yeah, man.

11:31.204 --> 11:32.559
The good old boys club, all right?

11:32.584 --> 11:33.976
You look like Billy.
You talk like Billy.

11:34.001 --> 11:35.343
You're gonna be fine like Billy.

11:35.368 --> 11:37.169
So, I mean, yeah, we're both Texans,

11:37.194 --> 11:40.233
but I don't really think it
matters what I look like.

11:40.258 --> 11:42.765
Tell that to the probie. He's
as Texas as you are and...

11:42.790 --> 11:44.976
Ain't nobody gonna be mistaking
you two for brothers.

11:45.001 --> 11:46.859
Yeah, well, then they would be mistaken,

11:46.884 --> 11:47.990
because we are brothers

11:48.015 --> 11:49.867
because we got the same
number on our badge.

11:50.141 --> 11:51.578
Ain't that right, kid?

11:51.603 --> 11:53.412
I don't want Captain to die!

11:53.437 --> 11:54.872
Hey.

11:55.258 --> 11:57.416
Hey, Cap's gonna be all right.

11:57.579 --> 11:59.834
Texas has the best cancer
doctors in the country.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.444
Michelle.

12:25.507 --> 12:26.762
There you are.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.448
Hey.

12:28.993 --> 12:30.847
Aw, I thought you two might've left

12:30.872 --> 12:32.317
and gone to the VA program.

12:32.342 --> 12:34.186
Ah, well, I'm almost ready.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.038
I really am this time.

12:36.063 --> 12:37.957
We stopped by and checked it out.

12:37.982 --> 12:40.356
- They gave me this.
- Did they?

12:40.779 --> 12:42.613
You better take good care of him

12:42.638 --> 12:44.910
like your daddy takes care of you.

12:46.244 --> 12:47.942
You know I tried.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.011
I didn't lose her insulin on purpose.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.972
That's all the more reason why
you need to be in the shelter.

12:53.098 --> 12:55.013
I can't stay there at night. I just...

12:55.038 --> 12:58.262
I close my eyes, and
everything starts to close in.

12:58.287 --> 13:00.042
I get it.

13:06.751 --> 13:08.405
You remember this?

13:09.394 --> 13:10.948
Just a little pinch.

13:13.853 --> 13:16.372
Okay. Thank you.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.964
Hurts a lot less when Dad does it, huh?

13:22.451 --> 13:24.045
Done?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.296
Done.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.067
Okay.

13:31.109 --> 13:32.678
Here, this is for you.

13:34.077 --> 13:36.307
If there's ever an emergency,

13:36.837 --> 13:38.976
you call me, day or night, okay?

13:39.101 --> 13:40.519
Thank you, Michelle.

13:40.598 --> 13:42.382
You have enough Sertraline?

13:42.419 --> 13:44.059
Actually, I gave away all my meds

13:44.084 --> 13:45.775
to my friend Sad Eyes.

13:46.084 --> 13:47.611
She needs it more than I do.

13:47.675 --> 13:49.934
Maybe I can check your friend out.
Is she around?

13:49.959 --> 13:52.657
Uh, she's in the purple tent.

13:54.111 --> 13:55.452
You take care.

13:56.639 --> 13:57.745
Bye, Emily.

14:05.607 --> 14:07.129
Hey!

14:08.666 --> 14:10.088
What are you doing?

14:10.113 --> 14:11.454
Where's the Oxy?

14:11.479 --> 14:13.986
We don't carry medication
like that on the van.

14:14.011 --> 14:15.478
I see you people handing out freebies

14:15.503 --> 14:16.735
to everyone else on the block.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.698
Listen, listen, I'm just
here to help, okay?

14:18.723 --> 14:20.355
There's... there's children over there.

14:20.380 --> 14:22.330
Open the door, bitch!

14:22.355 --> 14:23.978
Or I'll take the keys myself.

14:24.140 --> 14:25.509
Fine, fine.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.317
You want the keys? Here.

14:29.145 --> 14:30.798
Aah!

14:30.823 --> 14:33.911
Now there's your freebie!
Get out of here!

14:35.841 --> 14:39.245
Damn it.

14:41.076 --> 14:43.617
Impeccable timing as always.

14:43.642 --> 14:45.775
You just missed him. He's... somewhere.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.035
Are you actually insane?

14:47.060 --> 14:49.293
You're gonna get yourself
killed coming down here alone.

14:49.318 --> 14:50.318
It's reckless.

14:50.343 --> 14:52.091
No, I never come down
here alone, I swear.

14:52.116 --> 14:54.950
There was this little girl, and
she needed some insulin, and...

14:54.975 --> 14:56.520
She's eight, Carlos.

14:57.084 --> 14:59.890
How'd you find me anyway?
This isn't exactly your zone.

15:00.637 --> 15:02.637
There's actually something
I need to tell you.

15:02.662 --> 15:03.668
What?

15:03.693 --> 15:05.144
That blue truck your sister got into

15:05.169 --> 15:06.605
the night she disappeared?

15:06.630 --> 15:07.809
- Yeah?
- We got a hit.

15:08.219 --> 15:09.568
What?

15:09.593 --> 15:11.777
We ID'd the owner.

15:12.392 --> 15:13.828
Oh.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.293
Michelle, for the love of
God, would you please stop?

15:31.378 --> 15:32.504
What?

15:32.529 --> 15:34.552
The bouncy-foot thing you
do when you're stressed.

15:34.577 --> 15:36.884
I don't do a bouncy-foot
thing when I'm stressed.

15:36.964 --> 15:39.358
You do, and it's making me tense.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.395
Just... I don't understand
why we're even here,

15:41.420 --> 15:43.942
when we should just be talking
to the truck woman ourselves.

15:43.967 --> 15:45.057
No, we should not.

15:45.082 --> 15:46.192
You're a paramedic.

15:46.217 --> 15:48.393
I'm a patrol officer,
not an investigator.

15:48.537 --> 15:50.544
It's literally Detective
Washington's job

15:50.569 --> 15:51.661
to handle this.

15:51.686 --> 15:53.903
It's been her job for three years.

15:54.670 --> 15:56.498
And she's mean to me.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.033
Promise me you'll play nice in there.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.827
Okay, I promise.

16:02.066 --> 16:03.495
Good.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.707
Ms. Blake.

16:06.087 --> 16:09.549
Nice to see you at the station
not in handcuffs for a change.

16:09.574 --> 16:11.087
Please, come on back.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.575
Play nice.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.629
So, Officer Reyes, you said

16:17.654 --> 16:20.130
you had some new information
about Iris Blake?

16:20.155 --> 16:21.805
Yes, ma'am. We do.

16:22.825 --> 16:24.340
Michelle, you should... you should...

16:24.365 --> 16:26.185
Um, yeah.

16:26.270 --> 16:29.403
Uh, so this all started after
I spoke to Dustin's neighbor

16:29.428 --> 16:31.059
about the night my sister went missing.

16:31.084 --> 16:32.231
Dustin Shepherd,

16:32.256 --> 16:34.169
Who has a restraining order against you?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.695
Yeah, um...

16:35.720 --> 16:38.198
we're mostly cool now.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.293
So he said... the neighbor, I mean...

16:41.402 --> 16:44.263
That he saw Iris get into
a blue truck that night,

16:44.288 --> 16:47.944
and then I found this
in some of her stuff.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.137
Definitely a truck, also blue.

16:51.313 --> 16:53.466
Dustin doesn't know who
any of those people are,

16:53.491 --> 16:55.280
but he said that she'd
started hanging out

16:55.305 --> 16:56.489
with some shady people.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.790
Dustin told us all about
the mystery people

16:58.815 --> 17:01.122
she supposedly started hanging out with.

17:01.236 --> 17:03.514
The trouble was nobody
could ever find proof

17:03.539 --> 17:04.981
any of them actually existed.

17:05.006 --> 17:07.051
Well, maybe now we can.

17:07.255 --> 17:08.996
I was able to get a plate on the truck.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.684
I hope you didn't run a plate on my case

17:10.709 --> 17:12.090
without notifying me.

17:12.116 --> 17:15.150
I didn't want to bother you
until we had something real.

17:15.175 --> 17:17.486
- Heaven forbid.
- But we got a hit, Detective.

17:17.511 --> 17:20.309
The truck owner's name is Arlene Hicks.

17:23.654 --> 17:25.358
I don't see Arlene in the gang.

17:25.383 --> 17:27.200
That's because she
reported the truck stolen.

17:27.224 --> 17:29.748
Literally a week before
Iris went missing.

17:29.866 --> 17:32.536
Whoever took it could've picked
my sister up that night.

17:32.561 --> 17:34.868
Assuming that’s the same blue truck

17:34.893 --> 17:36.547
that your neighbor saw.

17:36.572 --> 17:38.632
This all you got, Officer Reyes?

17:38.845 --> 17:40.426
Yes, ma'am.

17:40.506 --> 17:42.845
Okay. I'll look into it.

17:42.870 --> 17:44.306
Thank you, ma'am.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.855
Now, if you guys will excuse me.

17:47.271 --> 17:49.075
So you're just gonna blow this off?

17:49.180 --> 17:52.053
I said I was going to look into it.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.171
I know what that means coming from you.

17:54.196 --> 17:55.945
Michelle, you promised.

17:58.554 --> 18:00.405
Thank you for your time.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.824
Detective, I, um...

18:05.096 --> 18:07.871
I just want you to know
that the effort you put in

18:07.917 --> 18:10.956
on my sister's behalf
is truly remarkable.

18:20.398 --> 18:22.165
What happened to playing nice?

18:22.190 --> 18:23.467
I said "thank you."

18:23.492 --> 18:25.757
You should've seen how they
were trying to tag-team me,

18:25.782 --> 18:27.022
saying that I was the only person

18:27.047 --> 18:28.474
who didn't have anything to worry about

18:28.499 --> 18:30.152
'cause Billy was my people.

18:30.363 --> 18:32.335
Right. Well, yes.

18:33.424 --> 18:35.398
What does that mean... "well, yes"?

18:36.523 --> 18:38.177
Judd, you and Billy
have known each other

18:38.202 --> 18:39.730
for how long, 20 years?

18:39.755 --> 18:40.921
Mm-hmm.

18:40.946 --> 18:43.864
You two have literally been
through the fires together.

18:44.152 --> 18:46.825
Marjan and Paul don't know
him from a can of paint.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.591
And he doesn't know them.

18:48.830 --> 18:51.441
So, honestly, I would be a
little worried, too, Judd.

18:51.466 --> 18:53.294
Yeah, you're right. I just... I...

18:53.319 --> 18:56.413
This whole beef between Billy
and the Cap just sucks.

18:56.438 --> 18:59.129
I don't know why I introduced
those two in the first place.

18:59.154 --> 19:00.445
Yeah, I still don't know

19:00.470 --> 19:02.171
what you were thinking on that one.

19:02.196 --> 19:04.763
I mean, can you not just call Billy

19:04.788 --> 19:06.921
and try to walk this thing
back from the edge?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.639
No, I ain't trying to get in between

19:08.664 --> 19:10.085
those two old roosters.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.077
Well, you said the captain

19:12.102 --> 19:14.103
is not passing this test, right?

19:14.561 --> 19:15.991
Yeah, that's right.

19:16.016 --> 19:18.151
If it wasn't for that man
sending you to therapy,

19:18.176 --> 19:19.917
I don't know where you'd be, Judd.

19:19.953 --> 19:21.486
I don't know where we would be.

19:21.511 --> 19:24.374
So, if there's anything you
can do to return the favor,

19:24.399 --> 19:26.532
you damn well better do it.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.035
I'll call Billy tomorrow.

19:32.357 --> 19:34.640
Why do grown men have to
act like little babies?

19:34.665 --> 19:38.294
I ask myself that every day, my love.

19:38.497 --> 19:41.046
No, you don't.

19:48.206 --> 19:49.556
Chad?

19:49.875 --> 19:51.598
Have everything you need?

19:51.754 --> 19:53.685
Uh, yep.

19:53.846 --> 19:57.312
I can't get you a coffee,
fizzy water, adult beverage?

19:57.337 --> 19:58.843
Uh, water would be great, ma'am.

19:58.868 --> 20:00.351
- Thank you.
- "Ma'am."

20:00.376 --> 20:01.943
God, I love that.

20:02.049 --> 20:04.336
Do you know, in LA, some people
might find that insulting?

20:04.361 --> 20:06.320
But here, I just...

20:06.376 --> 20:08.335
Find it chivalrous.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.736
Well, I guess you're bringing
a little bit of LA to Texas

20:10.761 --> 20:12.458
with this meditation
room, though, right?

20:12.483 --> 20:13.874
I don't know about that.

20:13.899 --> 20:16.352
See, my husband... my ex-husband...

20:16.377 --> 20:17.987
He always had his man cave.

20:18.012 --> 20:20.147
So now that I'm single,

20:20.172 --> 20:23.592
I just want something of my own.

20:23.617 --> 20:25.280
So you're not missing California, then?

20:25.305 --> 20:26.553
I mean, everyone talks

20:26.578 --> 20:27.919
about how great the
weather is out there.

20:27.944 --> 20:29.577
Oh, well, I mean, the weather is great.

20:29.602 --> 20:31.430
It's just the people that suck.

20:31.455 --> 20:32.932
I mean, not all of them...

20:33.058 --> 20:34.755
but most of them.

20:34.780 --> 20:36.922
It sounds like you couldn't
wait to get out of there.

20:36.947 --> 20:39.055
Yeah, once my divorce was finalized

20:39.080 --> 20:42.921
and I completed my
court-mandated training.

20:42.946 --> 20:43.947
Training?

20:44.261 --> 20:45.901
For anger management.

20:45.926 --> 20:47.838
It's, um... it's not a big deal.

20:47.863 --> 20:49.206
Bad divorce, huh?

20:49.231 --> 20:50.826
Yeah, I've been there.

20:50.869 --> 20:52.134
Mmh. Have you?

20:52.225 --> 20:54.704
- You're still divorced?
- Yeah.

20:54.729 --> 20:56.788
That's been working out pretty well.

20:57.575 --> 21:00.709
It has.

21:01.004 --> 21:02.587
That's funny.

21:02.807 --> 21:05.679
I'm... I'm gonna go get that water.

21:05.755 --> 21:07.132
Don't go anywhere.

21:16.977 --> 21:18.769
Get it together.

21:21.787 --> 21:23.159
Did you want a sandwich?

21:23.184 --> 21:25.628
'Cause I-I could make you one,

21:25.661 --> 21:28.307
or we could order takeout.

21:28.649 --> 21:30.652
Oh, my God!

21:30.816 --> 21:32.324
Oh, my God!

21:32.522 --> 21:33.741
Chad! Chad, are you...

21:36.667 --> 21:38.300
What do I do? What do I...

21:39.786 --> 21:41.675
Okay. Let it go.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.267
Let it go.

21:43.292 --> 21:45.003
Drop it!

21:45.028 --> 21:47.423
Just drop it! Chad!

21:49.622 --> 21:50.969
Let it go!

21:51.155 --> 21:53.178
Please! Please!

21:54.635 --> 21:56.849
Don't you die on me, damn it!

21:57.089 --> 22:00.214
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

22:00.509 --> 22:02.095
_

22:02.120 --> 22:03.644
_

22:03.669 --> 22:05.669
_

22:05.694 --> 22:07.400
Okay, try to stay calm for me, ma'am.

22:07.425 --> 22:08.909
Should I start mouth-to-mouth?

22:08.934 --> 22:11.405
- Is he breathing?
- Um, Yes.

22:11.669 --> 22:13.230
Then probably not.

22:13.255 --> 22:15.301
Oh. Right, no.

22:15.453 --> 22:16.576
Of course.

22:23.003 --> 22:24.376
Hi!

22:24.401 --> 22:26.020
He's here. He's here.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.672
He must've cut a wire or something.

22:29.636 --> 22:31.309
Right this way.

22:31.334 --> 22:34.294
I-I did my best to clear
it off him, but...

22:34.472 --> 22:36.389
His name is... is Chad.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.597
TK, you check his ABCs
till medical gets here.

22:41.622 --> 22:43.856
Everybody, be careful of
all this exposed wiring,

22:43.881 --> 22:45.504
and Marjan, Mateo, why don't
you find the breaker box.

22:45.529 --> 22:46.529
Kill all the power.

22:46.554 --> 22:47.723
- Copy that.
- Yes, sir.

22:47.748 --> 22:49.402
All right, airways are open.

22:49.427 --> 22:51.528
- Respiration's okay.
- What do we have?

22:51.553 --> 22:53.573
Adult male. Witness says
he was electrocuted.

22:53.751 --> 22:56.659
BP's 125 over 80.

22:56.773 --> 22:58.411
Pulse is steady at 70.

22:58.436 --> 23:00.873
70 BPM after an electrocution?

23:00.898 --> 23:03.082
- No arrhythmia or tapychnea?
- No.

23:03.736 --> 23:05.371
I can't see any head injuries.

23:05.396 --> 23:06.520
Power off, Cap.

23:06.545 --> 23:08.856
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He's in the best possible hands.

23:08.881 --> 23:10.520
We got a laceration on the right arm.

23:10.545 --> 23:12.871
He's got a possible lower
posterior rib fracture.

23:12.896 --> 23:14.115
Let's get his shirt off

23:14.140 --> 23:15.844
and get him hooked up to the monitor.

23:21.382 --> 23:23.852
Abrasions on the lower left quadrant.

23:25.715 --> 23:27.689
Did somebody hit this guy?

23:28.550 --> 23:29.858
I mean, I had to.

23:29.883 --> 23:31.887
He was... he was clutching on...
on to the wire,

23:31.912 --> 23:33.450
and there was nothing
else that I could do.

23:33.475 --> 23:35.490
Wait, if he was holding
on to a live wire,

23:35.515 --> 23:36.809
how come his hands aren't burned?

23:36.834 --> 23:38.617
- Which wire?
- It was that one.

23:41.572 --> 23:44.332
This one that ain't
connected to nothing?

23:44.357 --> 23:46.084
Look, he was literally vibrating.

23:46.565 --> 23:48.088
Captain Strand.

23:48.113 --> 23:50.342
He's got a medical alert medallion.

23:50.367 --> 23:53.053
- He has epilepsy.
- He wasn't electrocuted.

23:53.084 --> 23:54.186
He's postictal.

23:54.211 --> 23:55.822
Let's get him on a backboard.

23:55.882 --> 23:57.912
Give him D-50to get him hydrated.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.123
He was having a seizure?

23:59.148 --> 24:00.758
Sure seems that way.

24:00.783 --> 24:03.220
Oh, my God, I beat...
I beat an epileptic.

24:03.346 --> 24:04.893
With a 2x4.

24:04.925 --> 24:06.576
Chad, I am so sorry.

24:06.601 --> 24:08.146
I did not beat you out of anger,

24:08.171 --> 24:10.983
and I really need you to know that.

24:11.239 --> 24:13.045
Well, that's one way to hit on a guy.

24:20.905 --> 24:23.037
All right, so this one right
here's the showstopper.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.029
I had to order it special
from a distillery

24:25.054 --> 24:26.665
on the Bourbon Trail.

24:26.690 --> 24:28.561
Careful. It's a little spicy.

24:38.473 --> 24:40.350
Good Lord, Ryder.

24:40.567 --> 24:41.912
That is not spicy.

24:41.937 --> 24:43.646
That is a flamethrower.

24:43.671 --> 24:44.792
Ain't it great?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.143
Want another?

24:47.282 --> 24:49.522
Why not? As long as
you're giving it away.

24:50.704 --> 24:52.024
Um...

24:52.250 --> 24:55.428
hey, you reckon about now
we're lubricated enough

24:55.453 --> 24:57.321
for you to tell me what's on your mind?

24:58.285 --> 25:00.244
All right. Uh...

25:01.712 --> 25:03.778
Why are you coming after Owen so hard?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.587
I thought you liked the guy.

25:05.612 --> 25:06.974
I do like him.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.475
What's that got to do with anything?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.780
Aw, come on, Billy.

25:09.805 --> 25:11.483
You snitched him out to the Deputy Chief

25:11.508 --> 25:12.596
about his cancer.

25:12.621 --> 25:13.837
Damn right I did.

25:13.998 --> 25:15.672
Strand thinks he's Superman.

25:16.084 --> 25:17.712
That means he's reckless.

25:17.737 --> 25:19.303
No, he ain't reckless.

25:19.328 --> 25:20.676
He is flashy,

25:20.701 --> 25:22.186
but his heart’s in the right place,

25:22.211 --> 25:23.255
but now, because of you,

25:23.280 --> 25:24.920
he's got to run the CPAT in full gear,

25:24.945 --> 25:26.608
which is damn near "Mission Impossible".

25:26.633 --> 25:27.808
Oh.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.162
Is that what he told you?

25:29.187 --> 25:30.878
- Mm-hmm.
- And they're making him do it?

25:30.903 --> 25:33.648
Hmm. CPAT was your cap's idea.

25:33.898 --> 25:35.377
That's crazy.

25:35.402 --> 25:37.099
Don't believe me? Go ahead, ask him.

25:37.726 --> 25:39.905
Why would he suggest
something as stupid as that?

25:39.930 --> 25:41.889
Because like I told you, he's reckless.

25:41.914 --> 25:43.533
And he don't bluff too good

25:43.558 --> 25:45.530
when he's not holding the best hand.

25:49.528 --> 25:52.083
Thanks for coming by tonight, Ms. Blake.

25:52.135 --> 25:53.745
Two meetings in a week.

25:54.048 --> 25:56.671
This is a new record for us, Detective.

25:56.966 --> 25:58.620
I know what you think...

25:58.645 --> 26:01.678
that Iris is just another
face on my wall.

26:01.703 --> 26:03.179
Why wouldn't she be?

26:03.206 --> 26:05.240
She's not your family.
You didn't know her.

26:05.408 --> 26:08.925
No, but I do know she
loves Lana Del Rey,

26:08.950 --> 26:11.853
Jack Russells, and organic chemistry.

26:11.878 --> 26:14.011
I know her hero was her big sister

26:14.036 --> 26:17.067
who she thought was a
wild child and a bad ass.

26:17.566 --> 26:18.695
She said that?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.857
To pretty much every one of her friends

26:20.882 --> 26:22.514
that I interviewed.

26:22.850 --> 26:24.616
She idolized you.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.583
You want to know a secret?

26:27.726 --> 26:30.616
There is no "just another
face on my wall."

26:30.674 --> 26:33.677
I take each of them everywhere I go.

26:33.702 --> 26:37.334
They are not my family, but
they sit right next to mine

26:37.359 --> 26:39.535
at the dinner table every night.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.552
Please don't ever mistake
not hearing from me

26:42.773 --> 26:44.224
for not caring.

26:44.457 --> 26:46.930
I appreciate you telling me that.

26:47.530 --> 26:50.934
It is nice to hear from you,
even if it's just for this.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.271
I spoke to Arlene, the
owner of that blue truck.

26:56.296 --> 26:58.713
She says she knows
exactly who stole it...

26:58.738 --> 27:00.986
The man she’d been living with.

27:01.895 --> 27:03.614
You recognize him?

27:06.135 --> 27:07.223
No.

27:07.248 --> 27:08.910
Wade Caldwell.

27:09.297 --> 27:12.098
Did three years in Huntsville
on an assault and battery,

27:12.123 --> 27:13.607
a year for possession with intent,

27:13.632 --> 27:15.209
armed robbery, and so on.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.436
- Did you talk to him?
- I have not.

27:17.461 --> 27:21.763
Because no one's seen him
since April 19, 2017.

27:22.086 --> 27:24.176
The day Iris went missing.

27:24.201 --> 27:26.011
I mean, that can't be a coincidence.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.172
It could, but I doubt it,

27:28.197 --> 27:30.974
especially since the last
time someone saw Wade,

27:31.098 --> 27:33.811
they called 9-1-1 on him
to report a bar fight.

27:34.016 --> 27:35.638
He was in an altercation

27:35.663 --> 27:38.398
with a pretty, 20-something brunette.

27:38.595 --> 27:39.983
Iris.

27:40.866 --> 27:42.319
What bar?

27:50.505 --> 27:52.474
Now, remember our deal.

27:52.499 --> 27:53.544
I do all the talking.

27:53.569 --> 27:55.482
You do the "keeping your mouth shut."

27:55.778 --> 27:58.586
- I can do that.
- Can you?

28:03.031 --> 28:05.550
April 19th...

28:06.312 --> 28:07.661
2017.

28:09.399 --> 28:10.922
Give me a minute.

28:11.139 --> 28:13.129
- Was that a Monday?
- Wednesday.

28:13.386 --> 28:15.361
Wednesday. Oh, you know what? Sure.

28:15.386 --> 28:16.771
Yeah, I remember that night.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.146
Man, people got sauced,

28:19.244 --> 28:21.315
puked on themselves, and forgot the tip.

28:21.340 --> 28:22.673
Oh, you know what, though? Wait.

28:22.698 --> 28:24.688
That could've been April 18th

28:24.713 --> 28:27.302
Or literally any day since.

28:27.327 --> 28:29.998
- That supposed to be funny?
- I'm just saying.

28:30.023 --> 28:31.583
Either of y'all remember
what happened to you

28:31.608 --> 28:33.100
some random night three years ago?

28:33.125 --> 28:34.475
Yeah.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.165
You recognize this man?

28:37.370 --> 28:39.794
Uh, maybe. It's possible

28:39.819 --> 28:41.843
His name is Wade Caldwell.

28:41.868 --> 28:43.506
You called 9-1-1 that night

28:43.531 --> 28:45.130
saying he was fighting in your bar.

28:45.155 --> 28:47.984
I've called about a lot of guys
fighting in my bar, Detective.

28:48.009 --> 28:49.595
And what about her?

28:50.417 --> 28:51.721
Oh.

28:51.746 --> 28:53.922
Okay. Yeah.

28:53.947 --> 28:55.965
Now, that chick I definitely remember.

28:55.990 --> 28:57.894
She was a fireball.

28:58.022 --> 28:59.248
It's coming back to me.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.621
They... they came in
here with some people,

29:01.646 --> 29:04.734
and then those two, they
really got into it.

29:04.759 --> 29:06.687
- You saw him hit her?
- Oh, no.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.021
- Mostly it was her hitting him.
- What?

29:09.046 --> 29:10.740
Any idea what they were fighting about?

29:10.765 --> 29:13.341
Nah, he just said that
she was out of control

29:13.366 --> 29:14.935
and they needed to go,

29:14.960 --> 29:16.573
and to be honest with you, he was right.

29:16.598 --> 29:18.334
Bitch was wild.

29:18.731 --> 29:20.130
And what happened next?

29:20.155 --> 29:21.350
I threw 'em out,

29:21.375 --> 29:24.171
and I waited 45 minutes
for the cops to show up.

29:24.209 --> 29:25.725
Thank you very much.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.800
You, sir, need another?

29:31.829 --> 29:33.352
You okay?

29:33.629 --> 29:36.516
She called me three times that night...

29:37.268 --> 29:38.768
and I...

29:38.903 --> 29:41.523
I just assumed she was with Dustin.

29:42.297 --> 29:45.527
But she was here in this place with him.

29:45.591 --> 29:46.766
And where was I?

29:46.791 --> 29:48.537
What was I doing that was so important

29:48.562 --> 29:50.697
that I couldn't take her calls?

29:52.015 --> 29:54.117
You know where I was?

29:55.348 --> 29:58.217
I was about to sing some
Emmylou Harris cover

29:58.242 --> 30:00.302
at some open-mic thing

30:00.327 --> 30:03.043
in front of about nine people.

30:03.521 --> 30:06.101
You know how many times I duck calls

30:06.126 --> 30:07.839
from my mother in a week?

30:08.139 --> 30:09.633
It's a lot

30:10.561 --> 30:12.011
It's life.

30:12.121 --> 30:14.053
It's what we do.

30:14.351 --> 30:17.116
What happened to your sister
almost certainly happens

30:17.141 --> 30:19.142
whether or not you pick up.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.271
Maybe.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.005
Or maybe if I had been therefor her,

30:25.030 --> 30:27.943
she wouldn't have just fallen
off the face of the Earth.

30:39.410 --> 30:40.914
Hey, Cap. A word?

30:40.939 --> 30:42.292
Sure.

30:42.317 --> 30:44.611
So this, uh... this test that
you’re gonna take next week,

30:44.636 --> 30:46.167
the CPAT,

30:46.192 --> 30:48.107
what do you figure the
odds are of you passing?

30:48.198 --> 30:50.048
Never tell me the odds.

30:50.759 --> 30:52.717
Yeah, but you ain’t Indiana Jones.

30:52.742 --> 30:54.803
Actually, it was Han Solo.

30:55.410 --> 30:58.239
Look, the odds are steep.

30:58.264 --> 31:00.214
I, uh, fully admit it.

31:00.239 --> 31:02.503
But doable. I've been training.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.089
- Oh, you've been training?
- Yep.

31:04.114 --> 31:05.374
What's your best time so far?

31:05.399 --> 31:07.582
Uh, I'd estimate...

31:08.063 --> 31:09.363
14 minutes?

31:09.388 --> 31:10.651
You'd estimate?

31:10.676 --> 31:12.760
Based on the amount of
time that had elapsed

31:12.785 --> 31:14.221
before I passed out.

31:14.246 --> 31:15.315
You passed out.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.362
Are you just gonna repeat back
to me everything I say to you?

31:17.387 --> 31:20.120
Well, I kind of have to hear it
all twice just to believe it.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.669
It's kind of curious, ain't it?

31:21.694 --> 31:23.082
What is?

31:23.107 --> 31:25.456
Well, that the brass would go
all the way to New York City

31:25.481 --> 31:27.091
to bring you down here,

31:27.380 --> 31:29.449
you know, beg you, I'm guessing,

31:29.474 --> 31:30.963
and now here they are,

31:30.988 --> 31:32.841
and they're forcing you to take a test

31:32.866 --> 31:34.998
that in all likelihood
you're gonna fail.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.679
That don't track, does it?

31:36.704 --> 31:38.227
Well, uh, Judd,

31:38.252 --> 31:41.908
I was not transparent with
them about the cancer.

31:42.084 --> 31:44.520
You was not transparent
about the cancer.

31:44.545 --> 31:45.937
Stop doing that.

31:46.544 --> 31:48.189
All right. I'll tell you what.

31:48.375 --> 31:51.446
Get on the horn right now
with your Union <rep,

31:51.471 --> 31:54.151
get him down here, because
they can't make you do it.

31:54.176 --> 31:55.631
I already agreed to it.

31:55.656 --> 31:57.754
Unless, of course, it ain’t
them that's making you do it

31:57.779 --> 32:00.467
and the whole idiotic
enterprise is your idea.

32:00.492 --> 32:02.756
You spoke to Billy?

32:02.781 --> 32:04.043
Yeah.

32:04.170 --> 32:05.624
I spoke to Billy.

32:06.293 --> 32:07.750
Damn it, Owen.

32:07.775 --> 32:09.293
I sat there, and I watched you

32:09.318 --> 32:11.146
sit across from the
man at my poker table

32:11.171 --> 32:12.923
and take all of his money.

32:12.948 --> 32:14.695
So how'd you let this happen?

32:14.720 --> 32:17.261
I don't know. I let my guard down.

32:17.567 --> 32:20.555
And I didn't think we were
still playing a game.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.056
Billy's always playing a game.

32:22.081 --> 32:23.357
And I liked him.

32:23.697 --> 32:26.269
I liked having a peer, someone my age,

32:26.453 --> 32:28.236
someone I didn't have to captain

32:28.261 --> 32:30.524
or parent.

32:32.302 --> 32:33.739
Liked having a friend.

32:33.764 --> 32:35.691
- Billy ain't your friend.
- Thanks, Judd.

32:35.716 --> 32:36.787
I'm starting to get that.

32:36.812 --> 32:40.881
No, what you liked was having
somebody to show off to,

32:40.990 --> 32:43.514
and that's exactly what you did
when you brought him down here

32:43.539 --> 32:46.396
and you bragged about
your shiny new firehouse.

32:46.676 --> 32:48.548
Right, then you rubbed your juice bar

32:48.573 --> 32:49.842
all up in his face.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.003
Of course he's gonna want to
take this place from you.

32:52.028 --> 32:53.548
That is never gonna happen.

32:53.573 --> 32:54.617
Really?

32:54.642 --> 32:55.988
'Cause from where I'm sitting,

32:56.013 --> 32:58.176
it would take nothing
short of an act of God

32:58.201 --> 33:00.100
to get you through that test next week.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.467
So I'm gonna do something

33:02.492 --> 33:05.350
that my wife hasn't been able
to get me to do for a while.

33:05.687 --> 33:07.608
I'ma pray.

33:08.455 --> 33:10.209
Thank you. I appreciate that.

33:10.234 --> 33:11.656
No, I ain't praying for you.

33:11.681 --> 33:13.334
I'm praying for the crew,

33:13.359 --> 33:17.236
because if you lose the 126, so do they.

33:17.455 --> 33:19.197
And you and I know it.

33:32.846 --> 33:35.292
I appreciate you taking
the time to talk.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.887
"Parlez on the fairway".

33:36.912 --> 33:38.383
I love it.

33:39.056 --> 33:42.595
Look, you and I both know cancer sucks,

33:42.886 --> 33:44.664
and it makes passing the CPAT...

33:44.689 --> 33:46.159
A virtual impossibility.

33:46.184 --> 33:48.660
Not impossible, especially for
somebody as stubborn as I am,

33:48.685 --> 33:49.941
but that said,

33:50.075 --> 33:52.066
living with the uncertainty
is not fair to my crew

33:52.091 --> 33:53.097
when they're out there

33:53.122 --> 33:54.964
putting their lives on
the line every day.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.777
I agree with you there.

33:57.433 --> 33:59.529
You want to take this
into the clubhouse?

33:59.554 --> 34:01.821
Why, are you afraid of a
little weather, New York?

34:03.061 --> 34:06.191
Dulcius ex asperis.

34:11.391 --> 34:13.800
Adversity makes victory all the sweeter.

34:14.063 --> 34:15.753
That it does.

34:16.562 --> 34:18.797
And that's what I'm here to ask you...

34:18.850 --> 34:20.518
to accept victory...

34:20.737 --> 34:22.427
with some grace.

34:24.357 --> 34:25.835
Hurry, inside.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.369
The clubhouse is just over that hill.

34:28.831 --> 34:31.496
All right, look, here's my offer.

34:32.406 --> 34:35.627
I tender my resignation
today with Austin FD.

34:35.967 --> 34:37.579
But I want your word

34:37.708 --> 34:40.319
that my people get to stay at the 126.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.614
It takes a real man
to fall on his sword.

34:46.541 --> 34:48.286
I give you props for that.

34:48.312 --> 34:49.786
But?

34:50.594 --> 34:53.018
But you can't fold now
after going all-in.

34:53.043 --> 34:54.493
That's not how the game is played.

34:54.518 --> 34:55.643
This isn't a game.

34:55.668 --> 34:58.755
I'm talking about actual people
here, Billy, good people,

34:58.780 --> 35:00.841
people who gave up their
lives in other places

35:00.866 --> 35:02.652
to come down here and rebuild the 126.

35:02.677 --> 35:05.679
Yeah, for huge salary increases.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.472
That's real altruistic.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.777
Especially Strickland and Marwani...

35:09.802 --> 35:11.050
Hope I'm saying that right...

35:11.075 --> 35:13.121
And your probie, Chavez.

35:13.428 --> 35:16.731
It took him five tries to
pass his written exam.

35:17.483 --> 35:20.486
See, I think we can be better than that.

35:20.733 --> 35:23.071
Now, your son seems to have
his head on his shoulders.

35:23.096 --> 35:25.240
Well, now anyway.

35:25.431 --> 35:28.368
Heard he had a little
trouble back in New York.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.161
I reckon it'd just be weird

35:30.342 --> 35:33.289
keeping him around after you're gone.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.667
You are some piece of work, Billy.

35:35.752 --> 35:38.233
So I've been told.

35:38.426 --> 35:39.645
Billy!

35:39.815 --> 35:41.924
Billy! Billy!

35:48.277 --> 35:50.383
Someone call 9-1-1!

36:07.728 --> 36:09.493
I can't believe he's still alive.

36:09.605 --> 36:11.931
- I mean, what are the odds?
- Pretty good, actually.

36:11.956 --> 36:14.997
About 90% of people who get
struck by lightning live.

36:15.232 --> 36:16.833
How do you know that?

36:16.858 --> 36:18.163
I'm from Florida...

36:18.188 --> 36:19.994
Lightning strike capital of the world.

36:20.019 --> 36:21.756
And an inordinate amount of them

36:21.781 --> 36:23.435
happen on the golf course.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.288
Yeah, that's why I’m
gonna stick to bowling.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.793
- Hey, TK.
- Mm.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.689
What do you see in there?

36:29.469 --> 36:30.818
He's still in there.

36:30.843 --> 36:32.537
Yeah, I know he's still in there, TK,

36:32.562 --> 36:34.274
'cause he ain't come out yet.

36:34.299 --> 36:37.079
- Who's doing the talking?
- The Deputy Chief.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.152
Oh.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.678
He's getting up.

36:42.790 --> 36:44.705
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.

37:02.076 --> 37:03.798
Missed a spot.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.291
Well?

37:17.401 --> 37:18.896
Well what?

37:21.189 --> 37:22.858
Everyone can relax.

37:22.883 --> 37:25.392
When he's this glib, it's...
it's always good news.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.680
No, come on, Cap. What did the man say?

37:27.760 --> 37:29.448
He still gonna make you take that test?

37:29.473 --> 37:31.689
- Turns out I already did.
- When?

37:31.714 --> 37:33.174
When I carried a grown man

37:33.199 --> 37:34.616
from the 12th hole to the clubhouse

37:34.641 --> 37:35.815
in under 4 minutes.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.232
- In the rain.
- In the rain.

37:37.257 --> 37:38.494
You saved a man's life.

37:38.519 --> 37:40.759
Yeah, broke a couple of
his ribs in the process.

37:40.784 --> 37:42.294
Nice one, Cap.

37:43.811 --> 37:45.703
About saving a man's life I mean.

37:45.728 --> 37:46.986
Turns out the deputy chief says

37:47.011 --> 37:48.577
that's more than enough demonstration

37:48.602 --> 37:50.343
of my fitness in the field.

37:50.368 --> 37:51.928
Alhamdulillah.

37:52.908 --> 37:54.737
"Thank God," more or less.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.596
Well, it also don't hurt that
he's, uh, down a captain now.

37:57.621 --> 37:58.775
Yeah, Billy has a long

37:58.800 --> 38:00.518
and painful recovery ahead of him.

38:00.543 --> 38:02.396
Well, I, for one, am
glad that’s settled.

38:02.455 --> 38:03.948
Congratulations, Cap.

38:03.973 --> 38:06.235
Now all that's left to
tackle is the cancer.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.319
Anything you need, Cap.

38:08.689 --> 38:10.952
- That's right.
- We're here for you, Cap.

38:11.409 --> 38:12.889
Thank you.

38:13.130 --> 38:14.502
All right, listen, you fakers,

38:14.527 --> 38:16.994
why don't you go and actually
clean that rig for real?

38:17.019 --> 38:18.564
'Cause this is just getting sad.

38:24.627 --> 38:26.003
What?

38:26.379 --> 38:27.729
What?

38:27.813 --> 38:29.336
I called it, didn't I?

38:29.553 --> 38:31.244
I said only an act of God.

38:31.269 --> 38:32.486
Yes, well, I thought maybe

38:32.511 --> 38:34.330
you would've preferred
having Billy run things.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.681
You know, he is your friend.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.100
Yeah, Billy's my friend, but...

38:39.579 --> 38:41.146
you're my captain.

38:50.105 --> 38:51.845
This is Captain Blake.

38:51.870 --> 38:53.698
Michelle, it's Detective Washington.

38:53.723 --> 38:55.986
- I have news.
- What kind of news?

38:56.211 --> 38:58.370
I was looking at traffic
accident reports

38:58.395 --> 38:59.741
from the area around the bar

38:59.766 --> 39:01.540
where your sister was last seen.

39:01.565 --> 39:04.047
Was anything reported the
night she disappeared?

39:04.072 --> 39:06.683
Nothing reported, no, but on a hunch,

39:06.708 --> 39:09.769
I pulled satellite photos
of the surrounding area.

39:09.886 --> 39:13.238
Michelle, I think we may
have found something.

39:22.616 --> 39:24.396
Oh, great.

39:24.421 --> 39:25.939
It's you.

39:28.301 --> 39:30.444
How you doing, Billy?

39:31.626 --> 39:34.614
Well, let's see...

39:35.532 --> 39:38.910
Ruptured eardrum, tinnitus, uh...

39:39.800 --> 39:41.329
cataract.

39:42.078 --> 39:43.949
You probably think I had it coming.

39:44.002 --> 39:46.335
It was your idea to play
through a little weather.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.911
Mm, yeah, I do remember
saying those words.

39:48.936 --> 39:53.008
So you here to gloat...

39:53.279 --> 39:54.723
about getting the big W?

39:54.748 --> 39:56.870
I heard, uh, AFD's not
gonna make you run

39:56.895 --> 39:58.020
the CPAT anymore.

39:58.045 --> 39:59.067
Gloating's for people

39:59.092 --> 40:01.130
who aren't used to getting the big W.

40:01.692 --> 40:03.352
I'm here with a peace offering.

40:06.843 --> 40:08.731
Why in the hell would you do that...

40:09.560 --> 40:11.849
after I tried to run you out of town?

40:11.878 --> 40:13.736
Because you almost succeeded.

40:13.761 --> 40:15.768
I think you can agree that as enemies,

40:15.793 --> 40:18.741
we make each other a
little bit reckless.

40:19.109 --> 40:21.865
We almost blew our lives
up going at each other.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.289
Look at you.

40:24.674 --> 40:26.791
These fists still work, New York.

40:26.816 --> 40:29.293
Yeah, but as friends...

40:29.484 --> 40:31.713
we make each other better, stronger.

40:31.876 --> 40:33.866
Iron sharpens iron...

40:34.102 --> 40:35.886
like it says in the Good Book.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.761
Like it says in the Good Book.

40:37.786 --> 40:39.791
Look, I just think
Austin'll be better off

40:39.816 --> 40:41.275
if its two best fire captains

40:41.300 --> 40:43.319
are watching each other's
backs from now on

40:43.344 --> 40:44.642
instead of stabbing 'em.

40:44.826 --> 40:48.312
And also, I really enjoy
taking your money in poker.

40:50.895 --> 40:52.484
Well...

40:53.095 --> 40:56.737
I suppose I really do enjoy
kicking your ass at golf.

40:59.084 --> 41:00.574
Friends?

41:01.092 --> 41:03.225
Yes, sir. Friends.

41:03.448 --> 41:04.830
All right.

41:05.229 --> 41:07.289
I'll let you get some sleep.

41:08.230 --> 41:09.706
Hey, New York.

41:09.731 --> 41:11.124
For the record,

41:11.149 --> 41:12.629
I had three strokes on you

41:12.654 --> 41:14.221
before the lightning struck.

41:14.476 --> 41:16.632
You really did get your brain fried.

41:17.151 --> 41:18.760
Feel better, Texas.

41:36.942 --> 41:38.697
Son of a bitch.
