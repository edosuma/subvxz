00:01.187 --> 00:02.637
Previously on Lucifer...

00:02.662 --> 00:04.445
I was worried I'd never see you again.

00:04.470 --> 00:06.605
I've had patients who revealed a new side

00:06.611 --> 00:08.808
of themselves, but not so much

00:08.814 --> 00:10.876
the actual devil.

00:10.882 --> 00:12.847
- We're good, right?
- Yeah. Really good.

00:12.872 --> 00:14.680
We could be there for each other as friends

00:14.686 --> 00:16.148
even if it's about another guy.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.116
What is she doing here?

00:17.122 --> 00:19.051
Charlotte Richards, the defense attorney.

00:19.057 --> 00:21.287
Thought I'd dive into my employment.

00:21.293 --> 00:22.721
Humans are dying because of you.

00:22.727 --> 00:24.523
I'm stronger than you'd think.

00:24.529 --> 00:27.059
You seem attached to these creatures,

00:27.065 --> 00:29.495
and I can't figure out why.

00:29.501 --> 00:31.397
We shouldn't be here!

00:31.403 --> 00:35.201
The only place I've ever
felt wanted or respected.

00:35.207 --> 00:36.836
Is here with humanity?

00:36.842 --> 00:38.846
This is my home!

00:38.852 --> 00:40.076
Deal with it, Mother!

00:52.457 --> 00:55.521
Sunshine. Beautiful people.

00:55.527 --> 00:57.099
Expensive cars.

00:57.124 --> 01:00.632
The glamorous life.
Get ready to see the real

01:00.657 --> 01:02.995
Los Angeles on this thrill

01:03.001 --> 01:04.163
ride tour.

01:04.169 --> 01:05.831
Well, it appears I've been misled.

01:05.837 --> 01:07.533
Whoever put together this brochure

01:07.539 --> 01:09.301
should get special treatment in Hell.

01:09.307 --> 01:11.770
I don't need you to show
me around the city.

01:11.776 --> 01:13.405
Well, of course you do.

01:13.411 --> 01:15.407
This is an exciting time, brother!

01:15.432 --> 01:17.351
Now that we're making
Los Angeles our home,

01:17.376 --> 01:19.572
the City of Angels can
finally earn its name.

01:19.597 --> 01:21.714
You are making it a home.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.416
Mom and I are gonna find a way
to get back to the Silver City.

01:24.422 --> 01:26.685
- One way or another.
- But why?

01:26.710 --> 01:29.471
When Los Angeles has so much to offer?

01:29.496 --> 01:30.789
On your right,

01:30.795 --> 01:32.375
you'll see the famous shop,

01:32.400 --> 01:35.828
Pooch Pouch, the store that sells purses

01:35.834 --> 01:38.030
for purse-sized dogs.

01:38.036 --> 01:40.466
Clearly.

01:40.472 --> 01:42.301
- Don't get it confused with the store
- Excuse me. Sorry.

01:42.307 --> 01:43.669
that sells dogs in the shapes of purses.

01:43.675 --> 01:45.204
Sorry, I do apologize.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.206
- That's on your left...
- Pardon me, excuse me.

01:47.212 --> 01:48.874
Yeah, thank you.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.209
Please. That's your corner.

01:50.215 --> 01:53.145
Ah. Right. Forget everything

01:53.151 --> 01:54.313
you just slept through.

01:54.319 --> 01:55.848
Welcome to Los Angeles,

01:55.854 --> 01:58.183
city of reinvention, where you can become

01:58.189 --> 02:00.052
whomever you want.

02:00.058 --> 02:01.754
Uh, if we look over here...

02:01.760 --> 02:03.822
That humungous house in
the distance, the owner,

02:03.828 --> 02:06.892
he moved out here with just
ten dollars and a dream.

02:06.898 --> 02:08.327
Within three years, he was running

02:08.333 --> 02:10.663
the largest underground
sex club in the country.

02:10.669 --> 02:13.465
Los Angeles is also a place
where you can do

02:13.471 --> 02:15.868
whatever you want.
To your right hand side over here,

02:15.874 --> 02:18.537
this folically challenged man...
That's Sleepy Pete. Hello, Pete.

02:18.543 --> 02:19.905
Give us a wave.

02:19.911 --> 02:20.940
Everyone wave at Pete.

02:22.781 --> 02:25.678
He will sell you the
best Molly in the city.

02:27.099 --> 02:28.301
Don't buy his cocaine, though.

02:28.326 --> 02:30.440
It's got enough baking
soda in it to make a cake.

02:30.465 --> 02:33.018
It's not a bad idea, as I think about it.

02:33.024 --> 02:36.288
To your right again... My nightclub, Lux!

02:36.294 --> 02:38.724
The city's crowning achievement.

02:38.730 --> 02:41.097
My brother and I are celebrating...

02:46.438 --> 02:48.100
I don't understand him.

02:48.106 --> 02:51.103
Why won't Amenadiel embrace
this city like I have?

02:51.109 --> 02:54.239
Well, people often need time
to adjust to change.

02:54.245 --> 02:56.308
And he's only been here for a few months.

02:56.314 --> 02:57.676
And if what you say is true...

02:57.682 --> 02:59.912
What? That he's got a
stick so far up his ass

02:59.918 --> 03:01.256
you can see it when he yawns?

03:01.281 --> 03:03.148
That he's a fallen angel.

03:03.154 --> 03:04.683
Oh, yes, that, too.

03:04.689 --> 03:07.620
Then this could be about more
than finding a home for him.

03:07.626 --> 03:09.254
But we're here to talk about you.

03:09.260 --> 03:12.591
Why did you recently decide
that this was your home?

03:12.597 --> 03:15.694
Well, I said it when I was
in a row with my mum.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.808
I didn't realize how true it was
until I yelled it in her face.

03:18.833 --> 03:19.995
Yes, your mother,

03:20.020 --> 03:23.235
who is a literal goddess of all creation.

03:23.241 --> 03:25.504
Still haven't quite wrapped
my brain around that one.

03:25.510 --> 03:27.139
Yes, well, anyway, her and Amenadiel want

03:27.145 --> 03:31.374
to get back to the Silver City,
but it's not my home.

03:31.399 --> 03:32.277
It never was.

03:32.283 --> 03:33.579
And neither was Hell.

03:33.585 --> 03:35.080
No. No, that was somewhere

03:35.086 --> 03:36.582
I was sent as a punishment.

03:36.588 --> 03:38.984
Like the DMV, but less screaming.

03:38.990 --> 03:42.154
So would you say that
this is your first home?

03:42.160 --> 03:43.889
Yes, I suppose it is.

03:43.895 --> 03:45.591
And why do you think that's the case?

03:45.597 --> 03:48.447
Well, I don't know, Doctor. You tell me.

03:48.472 --> 03:49.662
I find that people

03:49.668 --> 03:52.998
make Los Angeles their home
for one of two reasons.

03:53.004 --> 03:55.067
Either they're running from something,

03:55.073 --> 03:57.369
or looking for something.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.904
Oh, and which one are you?

03:58.910 --> 04:00.773
I'm not the one on the couch, Lucifer.

04:00.779 --> 04:03.509
So ask yourself...

04:03.515 --> 04:05.611
Which is it?

04:05.617 --> 04:07.913
Running or looking?

04:07.919 --> 04:10.716
Lucifer? Lucifer?!

04:10.722 --> 04:12.718
Get out of the chair.

04:12.724 --> 04:14.053
Oh, come on, Detective.

04:14.059 --> 04:16.387
It's been ages since
I've sat in a throne.

04:16.394 --> 04:18.656
Oh, there's a lot of personality
here, isn't there?

04:18.663 --> 04:20.325
Appalling personality,

04:20.331 --> 04:22.060
but quantity over quality, I suppose.

04:23.802 --> 04:26.765
Genuine Medieval knights
costume in a Bel Air mansion?

04:26.771 --> 04:29.034
This man's home definitely
was his castle.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.336
Well, it couldn't keep him
safe from invaders.

04:31.342 --> 04:34.110
Crime scene. Let's go.

04:35.747 --> 04:37.643
Hang on.

04:37.649 --> 04:40.579
That's Dean Cooper, the
Los Angeles real-estate tycoon!

04:40.585 --> 04:41.880
Yeah, owns the whole block,

04:41.886 --> 04:44.149
and most of the biggest
developments in the city.

04:44.155 --> 04:46.085
Including the entire
block that Lux is on.

04:46.091 --> 04:47.219
Deeply unpleasant man.

04:47.225 --> 04:49.054
You wouldn't believe the deal I had

04:49.060 --> 04:50.556
to strike for my lease.

04:50.562 --> 04:52.157
All completely legal.

04:52.163 --> 04:55.694
If somewhat, well,
let's say "morally ambiguous."

04:55.700 --> 04:58.230
Well, that moral ambiguity
that he was so famous for

04:58.236 --> 04:59.898
may have finally caught up with him.

04:59.904 --> 05:01.400
Ella, cause of death?

05:01.406 --> 05:04.570
Explosive exsanguination from

05:04.576 --> 05:06.305
the carotid, punctured

05:06.311 --> 05:10.075
by this.

05:10.081 --> 05:11.643
Like from a champagne flute.

05:11.649 --> 05:14.113
Mm-hmm. Someone really popped his cork.

05:14.119 --> 05:17.216
You know like...

05:17.222 --> 05:19.051
You guys, like, the blood's the champagne.

05:19.057 --> 05:21.453
Like when you open a bottle,
his neck was the...

05:21.459 --> 05:22.488
We got it.

05:22.494 --> 05:24.256
Did you get any prints?

05:24.262 --> 05:25.724
Killer wiped it clean.

05:25.730 --> 05:27.192
Okay, well,

05:27.198 --> 05:28.694
maybe he didn't wipe the glass clean

05:28.700 --> 05:30.362
before it broke. Ella, are any of

05:30.368 --> 05:32.998
these pieces here big enough
to get a partial from?

05:33.004 --> 05:34.967
Probably not.

05:34.973 --> 05:39.260
But, hey, someone invented
glue for a reason. Right?

05:39.285 --> 05:41.221
You're going to reassemble
all those pieces?

05:41.246 --> 05:43.375
I'm fairly certain there are
people in Hell being forced

05:43.381 --> 05:45.410
- to do exactly that right now.
- Oh, I was the kind

05:45.416 --> 05:47.846
of kid who did jigsaw
puzzles picture-side down.

05:47.871 --> 05:49.915
- That's fascinating.
- Mm.

05:49.921 --> 05:51.283
Oh.

05:51.289 --> 05:52.651
What's wrong?

05:52.657 --> 05:54.753
Maze. Problem at Lux.

05:54.759 --> 05:56.922
Problem? What? One of the
Brittanies stub her toe?

05:56.928 --> 05:58.590
You're leaving?

05:58.596 --> 06:00.692
Lucifer, Cooper was one
of the most hated men

06:00.698 --> 06:03.128
in the city. We have tons
of suspects to go over.

06:03.134 --> 06:04.763
And if I don't get there soon,

06:04.769 --> 06:07.299
Maze will undoubtedly fix the
problem herself, which usually

06:07.305 --> 06:08.500
- involves knives.
- But...

06:08.506 --> 06:09.535
So unless you want to be blamed

06:09.541 --> 06:12.275
for a four-toed Brittany...

06:19.884 --> 06:22.447
Uh... hello?

06:22.453 --> 06:23.882
We're closed.

06:23.888 --> 06:26.852
Hi, okay, we've got some anomalies here,

06:26.858 --> 06:29.188
especially with the quarterlies...

06:29.194 --> 06:31.256
Maze, did you forget

06:31.262 --> 06:33.365
to bribe the inspectors this month?

06:33.390 --> 06:35.294
Are you the proprietor?

06:35.300 --> 06:37.129
I am, yes.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.965
And who are you, lounging
around like you own the place?

06:39.971 --> 06:42.334
Oh, I actually do own the place.

06:42.340 --> 06:45.204
Lucifer Morningstar,

06:45.210 --> 06:46.943
you're being evicted.

06:49.331 --> 06:55.199
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

07:00.034 --> 07:02.228
All right, explain what you
mean by "evicted,"

07:02.234 --> 07:04.631
and do it carefully as
your life may depend on it.

07:04.637 --> 07:07.467
Okay, Mr. Morningstar.
My name is Eric Cooper.

07:07.473 --> 07:10.203
I've assumed all of Cooper's holding

07:10.209 --> 07:12.272
and assets, Lux among them.

07:12.278 --> 07:14.707
You're Dean Cooper's son.

07:14.713 --> 07:17.410
Your father was just brutally
murdered, and here you

07:17.416 --> 07:19.345
scant hours after you were notified,

07:19.351 --> 07:20.880
divvying up the spoils.

07:20.886 --> 07:23.783
I don't know whether to
be horrified or impressed.

07:23.789 --> 07:26.953
What happened to my
father was unfortunate.

07:26.959 --> 07:27.929
Yes.

07:27.954 --> 07:30.957
But business is business.

07:30.963 --> 07:34.460
Well, impressed it is.

07:34.466 --> 07:37.363
Your father and I made a
deal for me to live here,

07:37.369 --> 07:39.299
so I'm sure you and I can
come to some agreement.

07:39.305 --> 07:43.436
Tell me, Eric, what is it you desire?

07:44.743 --> 07:48.009
I want my father to turn
over in his grave.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.109
Hated the old man, eh?

07:50.115 --> 07:51.200
Well, I can relate to that.

07:51.225 --> 07:53.046
My father's not on my
Christmas card list either.

07:53.052 --> 07:56.216
In fact, I moved here
to get away from him.

07:56.222 --> 07:58.218
Surely you can understand that.

07:58.224 --> 08:01.354
No, not really.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.023
And I saw your "lease"...

08:04.029 --> 08:07.427
It was written in lipstick
on a stripper's thong.

08:07.433 --> 08:10.663
- Not exactly legally binding.
- Hm.

08:10.669 --> 08:12.398
Well, maybe we can write
the new one in blood.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.900
I find that to be quite binding.

08:13.906 --> 08:15.468
Let's not.

08:15.474 --> 08:17.237
You have no legal right to be here,

08:17.243 --> 08:18.972
so if you don't vacate,

08:18.978 --> 08:20.073
I'll have you removed.

08:21.808 --> 08:23.943
It's not that easy to remove me.

08:23.949 --> 08:25.478
Last time, it took the power of God.

08:25.484 --> 08:27.972
What do you have... A few
expensive lawyers?

08:27.997 --> 08:30.283
Or are you gonna do it yourself?

08:30.289 --> 08:32.188
Not in front of all of these humans.

08:33.092 --> 08:36.556
If I were you, I'd leave.

08:36.562 --> 08:37.991
That's fine.

08:37.996 --> 08:40.297
This is a police matter now.

08:41.232 --> 08:43.596
Let's go.

08:43.602 --> 08:45.665
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go, man.

08:45.671 --> 08:47.901
It's not like you to get in the way

08:47.907 --> 08:49.402
of a good eviscerating, Maze.

08:49.408 --> 08:50.297
What was that about?

08:50.322 --> 08:53.306
You'd be eviscerating the wrong person.

08:53.312 --> 08:54.440
This is your mother's doing.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.176
Mum? How?

08:57.182 --> 09:00.113
You told her you want to
stay here on Earth.

09:00.119 --> 09:03.082
Now someone's trying to
take Lux away from you.

09:03.088 --> 09:04.317
Don't be absurd, Maze.

09:04.323 --> 09:06.586
I just saw American Psycho's father.

09:06.592 --> 09:09.055
The man wasn't destroyed
by the Goddess of Creation.

09:09.061 --> 09:11.424
He was killed in a fit of human passion.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.726
But that greasy weasel might be right.

09:13.732 --> 09:15.662
This is a police matter. Lucky me.

09:15.668 --> 09:16.863
Don't act like your mother

09:16.869 --> 09:18.665
isn't capable of this, Lucifer.

09:18.671 --> 09:21.100
Ah, that's enough help from
you today Maze, thank you.

09:21.106 --> 09:22.835
All right, fine.

09:22.841 --> 09:25.705
You can't see it,
I'll find someone who will.

09:25.711 --> 09:27.540
I don't see it.

09:27.546 --> 09:29.676
Of course you don't.

09:29.682 --> 09:32.345
So after you said you'd "handle things,"

09:32.351 --> 09:34.247
you're hiding behind her skirt again?

09:34.253 --> 09:36.115
I am handling things, Maze.

09:36.121 --> 09:37.951
Mom and I are trying to
find a way back home.

09:37.957 --> 09:39.686
So why would she murder some human?

09:39.692 --> 09:40.753
That woman is

09:40.759 --> 09:43.890
dangerous, duplicitous...

09:43.896 --> 09:46.263
And she's standing right
behind me, isn't she?

09:47.566 --> 09:48.728
Pardon my interruption,

09:48.734 --> 09:50.596
but what am I being blamed for now?

09:50.602 --> 09:52.065
I know what you're doing,

09:52.071 --> 09:54.500
trying to take away
Lucifer's home on Earth,

09:54.506 --> 09:56.736
so he can help you get back

09:56.742 --> 09:58.338
to the Silver City.

09:58.344 --> 09:59.639
It won't work.

09:59.645 --> 10:01.074
The demon is talking,

10:01.080 --> 10:02.709
but not making any sense.

10:02.715 --> 10:04.377
Typical, I suppose.

10:04.383 --> 10:05.812
She thinks you killed the man

10:05.818 --> 10:08.081
who owns Lux to get Lucifer evicted.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.585
Mazikeen.

10:12.591 --> 10:15.421
If I did come up with such a plan,

10:15.427 --> 10:19.225
do you think it would be
you who figured it out?

10:19.231 --> 10:21.260
Whatever you're up to,

10:21.266 --> 10:23.166
I will find out.

10:29.341 --> 10:32.205
Oh, she thinks she's smart.

10:32.211 --> 10:34.407
Mom?

10:34.413 --> 10:36.542
You weren't actually
involved in that man's death,

10:36.567 --> 10:38.478
- right?
- Well, of course not.

10:38.484 --> 10:42.482
But it might be able to
be used to our advantage.

10:42.488 --> 10:47.053
Maybe Lucifer will agree
to come home with us now.

10:47.059 --> 10:48.488
Right.

10:48.494 --> 10:51.991
All my sons are important.

10:51.997 --> 10:54.027
It isn't about Lucifer.

10:54.033 --> 10:55.428
It's about our family.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.830
I've already lost a son.

10:57.836 --> 11:01.601
I will not leave another one behind.

11:01.607 --> 11:03.736
It doesn't matter, Mom.

11:03.742 --> 11:06.339
Lucifer loves that place.

11:06.345 --> 11:08.041
And no human is gonna make him give it up

11:08.047 --> 11:10.043
as long as it's still standing.

11:10.049 --> 11:12.018
Is that so?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.716
Careful...

11:26.865 --> 11:29.362
And that is how we do it!

11:29.368 --> 11:31.998
Ta' vonlu!

11:32.004 --> 11:33.900
Ta' von what?

11:33.906 --> 11:36.035
It's Klingon for "the king is trapped."

11:36.041 --> 11:38.905
In Star Trek, they play
three-dimensional chess.

11:38.911 --> 11:40.706
Okay.

11:40.712 --> 11:44.043
And I'm gonna check this for prints now.

11:44.068 --> 11:45.597
- Great.
- No problem.

11:45.855 --> 11:46.950
Hey.

11:46.975 --> 11:48.781
All our info on Dean Cooper.

11:48.787 --> 11:51.584
No rap sheet, which,
quite frankly, is pretty amazing

11:51.590 --> 11:53.086
considering his reputation.

11:53.092 --> 11:54.520
Great. Thank you.

11:54.526 --> 11:57.056
Hey, are you busy?
I could use an assist on this case.

11:57.062 --> 11:58.391
Nah, Vice has me wrapped up

11:58.397 --> 12:00.359
on a bomb-making case.
I got to rush back.

12:00.365 --> 12:01.894
Where's Lucifer?

12:01.900 --> 12:04.564
Something came up at his club.
I don't think he's coming back.

12:04.570 --> 12:06.599
Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.
He never stays away

12:06.605 --> 12:08.396
for too long, right?

12:08.421 --> 12:09.569
Hmm?

12:09.575 --> 12:11.404
Huh.

12:11.410 --> 12:12.872
Hey, Lucifer. So, did you splint

12:12.878 --> 12:15.575
the stubbed toe, or did you
kiss it and make it better?

12:15.581 --> 12:18.954
Well, that's an interesting theory,
but we don't have any evidence

12:18.979 --> 12:20.446
that Eric Cooper's the killer.

12:20.452 --> 12:23.116
Mm, actually we do.

12:23.122 --> 12:24.502
Prints just came back.

12:25.390 --> 12:26.823
Eric Cooper.

12:27.759 --> 12:29.021
How did you...?

12:29.027 --> 12:32.758
Never mind. I'll meet you
at the Cooper building.

12:38.704 --> 12:41.368
So wonderful that you agree
with me for a change, Detective.

12:41.393 --> 12:42.635
Perhaps you're getting smarter.

12:42.641 --> 12:43.636
I don't agree with you.

12:43.642 --> 12:45.304
I have actual evidence on Eric Cooper

12:45.310 --> 12:46.339
that I need to look into.

12:46.345 --> 12:47.974
- What do you have?
- Motive.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.709
Little shark liquidated his father

12:49.715 --> 12:51.477
so he could liquidate his assets.

12:51.483 --> 12:53.146
How do you know he's liquidating assets?

12:53.152 --> 12:54.881
Because he's trying to evict me from Lux

12:54.887 --> 12:56.949
and sell off the building.

12:56.955 --> 12:58.718
You're saying that Dean Cooper's son

12:58.724 --> 13:00.286
is making deals just an hour

13:00.292 --> 13:02.255
- after his father was found dead?
- Exactly.

13:02.261 --> 13:05.024
- What could be more suspicious?
- Hey.

13:05.030 --> 13:06.119
When were you gonna mention that you're

13:06.143 --> 13:07.734
personally involved in the case?

13:07.759 --> 13:09.028
When you asked me.

13:09.034 --> 13:09.946
Nope.

13:09.971 --> 13:11.797
This an extremely high profile case.

13:11.803 --> 13:12.965
We are doing this by the book.

13:12.971 --> 13:14.400
I cannot have you terrorizing him.

13:14.406 --> 13:15.768
I would never.

13:15.774 --> 13:17.503
Or threatening to tear his arms off.

13:17.509 --> 13:18.871
That happened one time.

13:18.877 --> 13:19.972
Or hanging him from a window.

13:19.978 --> 13:21.638
I solemnly promise that the man's feet

13:21.663 --> 13:23.062
will remain firmly on the ground.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.614
What's that?

13:28.620 --> 13:30.416
Somebody call an ambulance...

13:30.422 --> 13:31.617
Check this out.

13:31.623 --> 13:33.553
There's a guy on the car!

13:35.527 --> 13:36.689
Is he alive?

13:38.830 --> 13:40.560
That's Eric Cooper.

13:40.566 --> 13:43.333
Just to be clear, that wasn't me.

13:53.826 --> 13:56.394
I mean, who leaps from the seventh floor?

13:56.419 --> 13:59.392
13th, minimum. This is the man
forcing me from my home,

13:59.398 --> 14:01.227
he can't even make a proper suicide jump.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.716
- Lucifer.
- Is this really necessary?

14:03.741 --> 14:05.698
Well, witnesses saw him
jump off a balcony

14:05.704 --> 14:07.066
by his own free will.

14:07.072 --> 14:08.006
He was distraught.

14:08.031 --> 14:09.536
That doesn't make him a killer.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.489
Well, it points to a guilty conscience.

14:11.514 --> 14:13.540
Christi, I know this might
be hard to hear, but...

14:13.546 --> 14:16.109
we have evidence that Eric
was in his father's house

14:16.115 --> 14:17.243
before he died.

14:17.249 --> 14:18.711
We live in the same compound.

14:18.717 --> 14:21.381
I'm sure there's DNA or
whatever all over the house.

14:21.387 --> 14:24.651
You can't actually think that
he killed his own father.

14:24.657 --> 14:26.453
Well, I mean...

14:26.459 --> 14:27.487
Let's not forget

14:27.493 --> 14:28.888
Eric's insatiable lust

14:28.894 --> 14:30.623
for Daddy's cold hard cash.

14:30.629 --> 14:32.459
If he's willing to do
something as monstrous

14:32.465 --> 14:33.493
as turning me out of my house,

14:33.499 --> 14:34.928
then killing his father

14:34.934 --> 14:36.596
isn't such a stretch, is it?

14:36.602 --> 14:38.164
Ooh!

14:38.170 --> 14:39.933
My Left Foot's trying to speak.

14:39.939 --> 14:40.934
N-No...

14:40.940 --> 14:42.202
money.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.670
Shh, baby.

14:43.676 --> 14:44.838
Don't talk.

14:44.844 --> 14:46.239
What are you trying to say, Eric?

14:46.245 --> 14:47.507
Dad...

14:47.513 --> 14:49.713
ran the business into the ground.

14:50.850 --> 14:52.078
We were buried in debt.

14:52.084 --> 14:53.880
I thought making emergency sales

14:53.886 --> 14:55.582
could save us, but...

14:55.588 --> 14:57.584
But what, baby?

14:57.590 --> 14:59.853
There's nothing left.

14:59.859 --> 15:01.120
I'm sorry, I...

15:01.126 --> 15:03.089
I couldn't live with disappointing you.

15:03.095 --> 15:04.724
Well, if this is about money,

15:04.730 --> 15:07.994
you should have called me first,
before taking that swan dive.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.629
Perhaps you'd like to renegotiate now?

15:09.635 --> 15:10.630
I can't.

15:10.636 --> 15:11.703
The deal is made.

15:11.728 --> 15:13.700
How could a sale be made so fast?

15:13.706 --> 15:15.368
Dean Cooper died yesterday.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.437
Is this that deal for all
the property on the strip?

15:18.923 --> 15:21.207
There's been a buyer
interested in that for years.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.009
Eric's dad had it all drawn up and then

15:23.015 --> 15:24.410
just let it sit on his desk.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.112
He just wanted to torture the buyer.

15:26.118 --> 15:28.348
So, you made the sale as
soon as you heard

15:28.354 --> 15:29.716
your father was gone?

15:29.722 --> 15:32.018
Dad couldn't block it anymore.

15:32.024 --> 15:34.053
But it didn't matter.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.055
It wasn't enough.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.124
What we have is enough.

15:38.130 --> 15:40.093
You and me.

15:40.099 --> 15:42.128
We don't need money for that.

15:42.134 --> 15:43.396
What a wonderful day.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.999
Potentially homeless and
definitely nauseated.

15:46.005 --> 15:48.265
Well, whoever bought Lux stood to gain

15:48.290 --> 15:50.003
from Dean Cooper's death.

15:50.009 --> 15:51.871
Yes. This man,

15:51.877 --> 15:53.673
the person who owns Lux now.
What's his name?

15:53.679 --> 15:56.376
Her. It's Eleanor Bloom.

15:56.382 --> 15:58.678
Detective, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

15:58.684 --> 16:00.113
I doubt it.

16:00.119 --> 16:02.515
But let's go talk to Eleanor Bloom.

16:02.521 --> 16:03.650
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

16:03.656 --> 16:05.151
Thank you.

16:06.258 --> 16:07.820
Oh, God...

16:20.039 --> 16:22.201
I think you're in the wrong place, lady.

16:22.207 --> 16:24.804
- You're Kevin Burnick.
- I am.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.840
Why? You come to take
a peek at the legend?

16:27.846 --> 16:30.043
According to the docket,
one of your clients

16:30.049 --> 16:31.844
is a known explosives expert

16:31.850 --> 16:33.913
named Patrick O'Neil.

16:33.919 --> 16:35.348
I need his help

16:35.354 --> 16:37.617
to get my son to come back home with me.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.353
You look hot and sound crazy,

16:40.359 --> 16:42.455
which is totally my type.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.525
But I don't talk about
my clients out of court.

16:45.531 --> 16:46.993
It's a lawyer thing.

16:46.999 --> 16:49.629
Oh, you misunderstand me.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.064
I'm his lawyer now.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.532
You can go home.

16:52.538 --> 16:53.967
Look, lady.

16:53.973 --> 16:55.768
I don't know what you've heard about me,

16:55.774 --> 16:58.171
but when the K-Dog gets a bone,

16:58.177 --> 16:59.739
he doesn't let go.

16:59.745 --> 17:01.674
Touch me, and I will sue you

17:01.680 --> 17:03.042
so hard...

17:11.890 --> 17:13.786
Oh...

17:17.863 --> 17:20.319
So, you think I had something
to do with Dean Cooper's death?

17:20.345 --> 17:23.128
Well, barely an hour after he was
killed, you closed on a deal

17:23.135 --> 17:24.731
he'd been obstructing for years.

17:24.737 --> 17:25.680
Sounds convenient.

17:25.704 --> 17:28.067
- Sounds like good business to me.
- Cooper intentionally

17:28.073 --> 17:30.003
gave you businesswoman blue balls

17:30.009 --> 17:31.471
just to torture you.

17:31.477 --> 17:32.905
- It's rather cruel.
- And I bought

17:32.911 --> 17:34.741
his favorite golf course
last year and turned it

17:34.747 --> 17:36.609
into a landfill for medical waste.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.177
Oh, I see. Well played.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.279
So, you're saying this was all

17:39.303 --> 17:41.141
a multi-million dollar prank war?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.516
I'm saying I didn't kill him over a deal.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.036
Besides, I just flew in from
Macau this afternoon.

17:46.061 --> 17:47.987
Check with the airstrip.
You have any other questions,

17:47.993 --> 17:49.355
you can ask my lawyer.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.890
Not so fast, Mommy Warbucks.

17:50.896 --> 17:52.558
I have some questions for you myself.

17:52.564 --> 17:54.148
Lucifer, you promised
that you wouldn't...

17:54.172 --> 17:55.695
Detective, this woman has my home.

17:55.701 --> 17:57.530
If you're gonna give me some sob story...

17:57.536 --> 17:58.831
Oh, far from it.

17:58.837 --> 18:00.967
I know your type.
You don't respond to emotion,

18:00.973 --> 18:02.435
or intimidation.

18:02.441 --> 18:05.004
The only thing that gets
you going is a deal.

18:05.010 --> 18:06.910
So, let's make a deal, shall we?

18:07.813 --> 18:09.809
What do you desire?

18:09.815 --> 18:11.548
Tell me and it's yours.

18:12.387 --> 18:15.815
I want everything Dean Cooper has.

18:15.821 --> 18:17.717
Well, Cooper owned Lux.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.085
So, how about everything apart from that?

18:19.091 --> 18:19.952
Everything.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.689
All I want is what was his.

18:22.695 --> 18:24.657
And then to destroy it.

18:24.663 --> 18:27.137
So, you're gonna tear
down all of his properties?

18:27.162 --> 18:29.162
I'm a developer.
I'm gonna knock everything down

18:29.168 --> 18:30.329
and then rebuild.

18:30.335 --> 18:31.254
Even Lux?

18:31.279 --> 18:32.579
Especially that place.

18:32.604 --> 18:34.000
That's prime real estate.

18:34.006 --> 18:35.702
I'm gonna build a mega-mall.

18:35.708 --> 18:36.803
A "mega-mall"?

18:36.809 --> 18:38.413
Yeah, you know, Gymboree, Sunglass Hut...

18:38.437 --> 18:40.707
Bulldozers get rolling as
soon as my people finish

18:40.713 --> 18:41.974
emptying the buildings.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.443
You know,

18:43.449 --> 18:47.284
a murder investigation can tie
up a development for years.

18:48.286 --> 18:50.183
I know you know more
than you're telling us.

18:50.189 --> 18:52.324
So, if there is any way,

18:52.349 --> 18:55.088
at all, that you can
help this investigation,

18:55.094 --> 18:57.356
that would be wonderful.

18:57.362 --> 18:59.392
She's good.

18:59.398 --> 19:01.414
I could use a few of her on my team.

19:02.468 --> 19:05.364
The accountants I had
looking over the deal

19:05.370 --> 19:07.734
did find several unreported payments.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.036
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

19:10.042 --> 19:11.537
You don't hide money like that

19:11.543 --> 19:13.276
unless you don't want anyone to find it.

19:18.817 --> 19:20.947
Bloom was right.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.149
Dean Cooper was making
large off-the-books payments

19:23.155 --> 19:25.284
and hiding them from his company.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.753
Well, could be anything.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.221
Drugs, blackmail.

19:28.227 --> 19:30.623
There's no shortage of bad
deeds in Dean Cooper's life.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.959
I'm gonna try and trace
where these payments went.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.694
Maybe our killer's on the other end.

19:34.700 --> 19:35.854
Oh, delightful.

19:35.879 --> 19:37.475
Whilst you do that, I'm gonna return

19:37.481 --> 19:39.911
to Eleanor Bloom's office
and get my home back.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.446
Not sure she's interested in selling.

19:41.452 --> 19:43.247
Well, maybe she'll change her mind

19:43.253 --> 19:45.932
after I turn her world into a
sphincter-loosening nightmare.

19:45.957 --> 19:47.752
Ew. Lucifer.

19:47.758 --> 19:49.676
I'm sorry about your home. I am.

19:49.701 --> 19:51.841
But you have to promise me you're
not really gonna hurt this woman.

19:51.865 --> 19:54.392
Well, then, help me,
Detective. Arrest her!

19:54.398 --> 19:56.027
I mean, isn't contributing to homelessness

19:56.033 --> 19:57.662
in Los Angeles a crime?

19:57.668 --> 19:59.664
Lucifer, the law is on Bloom's side here.

19:59.670 --> 20:02.066
I want to help you,
but we have to find a legal solution.

20:02.072 --> 20:04.268
Okay. So I'm on my own, am I?

20:04.274 --> 20:05.340
That's not what I...

20:17.187 --> 20:21.152
We know you build bombs
for the mob, Patrick.

20:21.158 --> 20:22.687
That's ridiculous.

20:22.693 --> 20:24.793
I... I deliver pizzas.

20:25.406 --> 20:27.068
Yeah.

20:27.239 --> 20:28.668
We cracked your code.

20:28.799 --> 20:30.628
"Hoping to get a delivery

20:30.634 --> 20:32.463
at Slauson and La Brea tomorrow night.

20:32.469 --> 20:35.633
Enough pepperoni to
feed a family of four."

20:35.639 --> 20:38.036
The mafia, the cartels,

20:38.042 --> 20:40.505
when they hear that we
have you in custody,

20:40.511 --> 20:43.141
and they think for a second about your...

20:43.147 --> 20:45.476
ingenious pizza code,

20:45.482 --> 20:47.845
they're gonna want to keep you quiet.

20:47.851 --> 20:49.080
So, uh...

20:49.086 --> 20:50.982
you can help me out, right?

20:50.988 --> 20:52.884
Depends.

20:52.890 --> 20:56.020
Hmm! Hands off my client, Officer.

20:58.495 --> 21:00.825
You're not his lawyer.

21:00.831 --> 21:02.827
The accused has a constitutional right

21:02.833 --> 21:05.696
to be counseled by whomever they choose.

21:05.702 --> 21:07.269
She can be my lawyer.

21:09.506 --> 21:11.502
I understand your confusion.

21:11.508 --> 21:13.137
You're very attractive.

21:13.143 --> 21:14.872
I've found that can also mean

21:14.878 --> 21:16.678
you're not very intelligent.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.901
I've already posted your bail.

21:30.926 --> 21:32.916
No. Wait, wait, wait.
I-I can't afford that.

21:32.941 --> 21:35.626
Oh, don't worry, I take payment in trade.

21:35.632 --> 21:38.433
Is it true that you know
how to make bombs?

21:39.369 --> 21:41.899
That's what I'm accused of.

21:41.905 --> 21:43.101
Yeah?

21:43.107 --> 21:45.670
Have you ever brought
down a building before?

21:45.676 --> 21:47.939
I know how it's done.

21:49.646 --> 21:53.014
I need you to destroy a nightclub for me.

21:57.655 --> 21:59.773
Let's get out of here, guys.

21:59.798 --> 22:01.592
Hands off...

22:01.598 --> 22:03.627
- my piano!
- Hey, man,

22:03.633 --> 22:05.662
we're just doing a job.
We don't want any trouble.

22:05.668 --> 22:07.631
You think you can come in
here and take apart my life

22:07.637 --> 22:09.032
without any trouble?

22:09.529 --> 22:10.825
You gentlemen

22:10.850 --> 22:12.903
have no idea who you're
dealing with, do you?

22:12.909 --> 22:14.304
Well...

22:14.310 --> 22:17.174
let me show you.

22:47.110 --> 22:49.373
This building was supposed to be empty.

22:49.379 --> 22:51.141
Oh, you know Lucifer, Mom.

22:51.147 --> 22:53.644
He wasn't gonna let this
place go without a fight.

22:53.650 --> 22:55.312
Or a drink.

22:55.318 --> 22:56.947
This is what humans call

22:56.953 --> 22:58.215
a "sit-in."

22:58.221 --> 23:00.259
What are you doing here?

23:00.284 --> 23:02.552
Well, I was gonna blow
the building up with C4.

23:02.558 --> 23:04.021
- Mom, you can't.
- I know.

23:04.027 --> 23:05.756
My client is a coward.

23:05.781 --> 23:08.421
And very difficult to convince
him to kill this many people.

23:08.427 --> 23:11.128
- No, Mom, that's-that's not what I...
- I may be able to

23:11.134 --> 23:12.567
use this to my advantage.

23:30.787 --> 23:32.215
To what do I owe the honor

23:32.221 --> 23:33.784
of your presence?

23:33.790 --> 23:36.603
I disagree with you wholeheartedly

23:36.628 --> 23:37.888
about wanting to stay here.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.322
But a mother doesn't have to

23:39.328 --> 23:42.759
agree with her son in
order to support him.

23:42.765 --> 23:44.728
So...

23:44.734 --> 23:47.064
what is it exactly
I'm supposed to sit in?

23:48.204 --> 23:49.666
Mum.

23:49.672 --> 23:51.435
You're actually being a good mum.

23:51.441 --> 23:54.104
We may have our disagreements,

23:54.110 --> 23:56.173
but you're still my son.

23:56.179 --> 23:58.542
I don't want to lose you again.

23:59.782 --> 24:01.712
Oh! Doctor!

24:01.718 --> 24:04.514
Mum, this is my therapist, Dr. Linda.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.417
Doctor, this is my mom in
a disturbingly hot body.

24:07.423 --> 24:08.252
Lucifer,

24:08.277 --> 24:09.567
I'm sure that sounds strange

24:09.592 --> 24:11.221
to her human brain.

24:11.246 --> 24:13.645
Oh, no, don't worry, Mum,
Dr. Linda's had a crash-course

24:13.651 --> 24:14.758
in celestial beings.

24:14.764 --> 24:16.660
Only melted her brain for about a week.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.129
Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:19.135 --> 24:21.131
I have guests to get back to.

24:21.137 --> 24:24.008
I'm sure you'll get on
like a house on fire.

24:33.916 --> 24:36.079
So... you're, uh...

24:36.085 --> 24:37.514
God's wife.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.116
Ex-wife.

24:39.122 --> 24:40.083
Oh.

24:40.089 --> 24:42.167
I prefer to not be defined by Him.

24:42.192 --> 24:45.222
Oh, of course, of course.

24:45.228 --> 24:48.125
Well, I just want to say,

24:48.131 --> 24:50.393
it's an honor to meet you.

24:50.399 --> 24:53.330
Thank you for...

24:53.336 --> 24:58.072
for all of... this.

24:59.909 --> 25:02.172
Existence.

25:02.178 --> 25:04.508
And I wanted to thank you

25:04.514 --> 25:06.743
for taking such good care of my son.

25:06.768 --> 25:09.295
You're so welcome.

25:09.301 --> 25:12.516
Our relationship must give
you a lot to talk about.

25:12.522 --> 25:14.688
Mm.

25:16.526 --> 25:19.960
I'm not telling you
anything about our sessions.

25:29.472 --> 25:33.804
Simon Halbrooks, of Private
Investigative Solutions.

25:33.810 --> 25:35.372
That's my company.

25:35.378 --> 25:36.506
Built it myself.

25:36.512 --> 25:39.276
Hmm. Dean Cooper made
several off-the-books

25:39.282 --> 25:41.545
six-figure payments to
you in the last few weeks.

25:41.551 --> 25:44.381
Those payments were off
of his books, not off mine.

25:44.387 --> 25:45.258
I'm legit.

25:45.283 --> 25:46.716
What kind of legit business has clients

25:46.722 --> 25:48.118
hide their payments to you?

25:48.124 --> 25:50.382
Do you trust your fellow
officers, Detective?

25:50.407 --> 25:51.382
Excuse me?

25:51.407 --> 25:53.223
Do you know for sure they
wouldn't take a bribe?

25:53.229 --> 25:55.192
Rat you out for the right price?

25:55.198 --> 25:57.794
How can you know who to trust?

25:57.800 --> 25:59.629
I'm the guy who answers those questions.

25:59.635 --> 26:00.986
And how do you do that?

26:01.011 --> 26:04.734
Think of me as a professional tempter.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.203
People hire me to find out

26:06.209 --> 26:08.572
if their R&D guy would sell secrets.

26:08.578 --> 26:10.482
Or if a famous couple's nanny

26:10.507 --> 26:13.410
could be bribed for
pictures of their kids.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.912
So whose loyalty were you
testing at Cooper's company?

26:15.918 --> 26:17.351
That's privileged information.

26:20.786 --> 26:22.628
I just thought you'd want
to know, we got calls

26:22.653 --> 26:24.387
about some kind of an
illegal party at Lux.

26:25.895 --> 26:28.195
Oh... thanks.

26:41.277 --> 26:44.140
Oh!

26:44.146 --> 26:46.376
Stormtroopers have arrived, everyone.

26:46.382 --> 26:48.345
Don't worry,
I'll deal with the boys in blue.

26:48.351 --> 26:50.525
You are the boys in blue, aren't you?

26:50.550 --> 26:52.782
The strippers aren't due
for another hour.

26:55.691 --> 26:57.287
Detective.

26:57.293 --> 26:58.889
What are you doing with them?

26:58.895 --> 27:00.924
I know him. I'll handle this.

27:00.930 --> 27:01.925
You sure, Detective?

27:01.931 --> 27:03.426
I can reason with him.

27:03.432 --> 27:05.295
This doesn't need to be a scene, I got it.

27:05.301 --> 27:07.364
Okay, guys, let's go.

27:07.370 --> 27:10.204
Thanks, guys.

27:14.410 --> 27:17.411
Lucifer, what the hell were you thinking?

27:18.314 --> 27:20.210
I...

27:20.216 --> 27:24.180
Turn the music back on,
this place is dead.

27:26.174 --> 27:27.889
Well, you heard the lady.

27:27.895 --> 27:28.852
Crank it up!

27:30.593 --> 27:32.656
Detective,

27:32.662 --> 27:34.257
does that mean you're on my side now?

27:34.263 --> 27:37.527
Lucifer, this is your home,
I've always been on your side.

27:37.533 --> 27:38.895
Well,

27:38.901 --> 27:40.497
if you're gonna stay, come on, stay.

27:40.503 --> 27:42.132
- No, I don't want to dance.
- No, no, no, come on.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.566
- You're the guest of honor now.
- I don't want to...

27:43.572 --> 27:44.768
Come on!

28:01.190 --> 28:03.720
He really does love this place, doesn't he?

28:03.726 --> 28:04.888
Yeah.

28:04.894 --> 28:06.690
This place.

28:20.910 --> 28:24.040
My son was right about you, Doctor.

28:24.046 --> 28:25.241
You are

28:25.266 --> 28:27.081
quite insightful.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.341
You know, for a moment there,

28:36.347 --> 28:38.510
you were actually having fun, Detective.

28:38.516 --> 28:39.645
Ooh.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.079
Obviously it was temporary insanity

28:41.085 --> 28:44.349
as now you're back at work.

28:44.355 --> 28:47.051
Well, as any parent knows the
best time to get things done

28:47.076 --> 28:48.791
is when everyone else is asleep.

28:49.994 --> 28:51.490
So, what have we got?

28:51.496 --> 28:53.859
Well, I've been going
through these payments

28:53.865 --> 28:56.228
to our professional tempter,
and none of them match up

28:56.234 --> 28:59.464
to the timing of any of
Cooper's new hires.

28:59.470 --> 29:02.601
I just can't figure out who
they were investigating.

29:02.607 --> 29:05.204
Riveting, but I meant what
have we got to prevent my club

29:05.210 --> 29:07.673
from being bulldozed into a Cinnabon?

29:07.679 --> 29:11.410
Lucifer, I'm sorry but that
trick that I pulled last night

29:11.416 --> 29:13.011
is only gonna work once.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.414
I can't see another way to save this place.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.450
Well, then, we need to
look harder, Detective.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.018
This is about more than me.

29:20.024 --> 29:22.521
I mean, do you know the
history of sin in this place?

29:22.527 --> 29:23.722
It was a, an institution

29:23.728 --> 29:26.191
decades before I ran it.

29:26.197 --> 29:27.259
Th-that crack

29:27.265 --> 29:28.527
in that mirror there.

29:28.533 --> 29:29.995
That crack is still there

29:30.001 --> 29:33.098
from when Ava Gardner threw a
scotch glass at Sinatra's head.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.466
Hmm.

29:34.472 --> 29:37.269
Underneath here there's
prohibition tunnels everywhere.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.304
Howard Hughes used to use
them to sneak his mistresses

29:39.310 --> 29:41.540
away from his other mistresses.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.041
And that stool that you're sitting on,

29:43.047 --> 29:44.676
that very stool, Detective,

29:44.682 --> 29:46.144
this may disturb and titillate you...

29:46.150 --> 29:47.946
We have to go see Simon Halbrooks again.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.081
I think I know

29:49.087 --> 29:51.516
- who he had Cooper looking into.
- Well, I'm sorry,

29:51.522 --> 29:53.485
I can't leave Lux undefended.

29:53.491 --> 29:55.120
Really?

29:55.126 --> 29:56.259
Okay.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.692
Eleanor Bloom's entire

30:00.698 --> 30:03.428
moving crew is passed out on your floor.

30:03.434 --> 30:07.165
The police aren't gonna be
here for at least another day.

30:07.171 --> 30:10.035
Lux is fine.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.504
I really need your help here.

30:12.510 --> 30:15.073
Really?

30:23.955 --> 30:28.587
You don't trust her, either, do you?

30:28.593 --> 30:30.122
It's not what you think, Maze.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.490
Listen, when I first came to Earth,

30:31.496 --> 30:33.725
I made certain mistakes, all right?

30:33.750 --> 30:36.337
I'm just making sure Mom
doesn't make the same ones.

30:36.343 --> 30:37.796
That's it. I'm protecting her.

30:39.422 --> 30:40.784
Right.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.569
She didn't tell you who she
was meeting, did she?

30:44.575 --> 30:46.471
So who do you think it is, hmm?

30:46.477 --> 30:48.006
An assassin?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.308
A terrorist?

30:49.314 --> 30:52.311
I'm quite sure it's no one so dramatic.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.052
Oh...

31:00.058 --> 31:02.721
I did not see that coming.

31:10.223 --> 31:11.797
I saw a sadness in you.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.498
A sadness and a strength.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.000
Look, I know this is

31:15.006 --> 31:16.501
forward of me but...

31:16.507 --> 31:18.136
you want to grab a drink in my room?

31:18.142 --> 31:22.274
I mean I probably shouldn't.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.076
Oh, you definitely shouldn't.

31:24.082 --> 31:25.444
I mean, I'm all for

31:25.450 --> 31:27.045
examining your innermost desires,

31:27.051 --> 31:29.514
but at least examine your options first.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.849
Uh, hey, buddy.

31:30.855 --> 31:31.990
I'm working here.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.919
Indeed you are, in that it's literally

31:33.925 --> 31:35.153
your job to seduce her,

31:35.159 --> 31:36.388
and report back to her fiancée's

31:36.394 --> 31:37.756
wealthy parents.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.858
Or am I wrong?

31:39.864 --> 31:42.194
Mm.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.995
Oh, something I said?

31:44.001 --> 31:46.365
You don't just tempt potential
employees, Simon.

31:46.371 --> 31:49.034
You also go after potential spouses.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.535
Dean Cooper's payments started

31:50.541 --> 31:52.971
to you just after his son
got engaged to Christi.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.577
Care to explain?

31:57.615 --> 31:58.643
It's true.

31:58.649 --> 32:00.746
Old Man Cooper didn't trust Christi.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.280
She came from Nowheresville, Michigan,

32:02.286 --> 32:04.486
where they put cars on blocks in yards.

32:04.511 --> 32:06.184
So Dean Cooper thought she
was after his son's money,

32:06.190 --> 32:08.720
and hired you to prove that
she was just a gold digger?

32:08.726 --> 32:09.955
And I approached her.

32:09.961 --> 32:13.258
Rented Bentley, fake Rolex,
the whole nine yards.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.559
I laid it on thick.

32:14.565 --> 32:15.861
And? Did she sleep with you?

32:15.867 --> 32:17.529
She passed.

32:17.535 --> 32:18.864
She stayed faithful.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.899
What, you couldn't seduce
her with your fake Rolex?

32:20.905 --> 32:22.734
Well, color me shocked.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.936
Hey, man, my success rate is pretty high.

32:24.942 --> 32:27.072
She was really in love with her fiancée.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.526
It happens sometimes.

32:28.551 --> 32:30.887
So if she didn't cheat, then what
happened with Dean Cooper?

32:30.911 --> 32:32.377
I told the old man the truth.

32:32.383 --> 32:34.045
But it didn't matter, he didn't like her.

32:34.051 --> 32:36.283
Even if there was no
evidence of her cheating,

32:36.308 --> 32:39.551
he wanted me to... make some.

32:39.557 --> 32:40.719
"Make some?"

32:40.725 --> 32:42.254
I photoshopped pictures of her

32:42.260 --> 32:44.454
in some compromising positions.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.058
What?

32:47.064 --> 32:48.305
It was a lot of money.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.228
So Dean Cooper tried to blackmail Christi

32:50.234 --> 32:51.630
into breaking off her engagement

32:51.636 --> 32:53.265
with fake proof of her cheating?

32:53.290 --> 32:55.534
That's some serious motive for murder.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.269
The poor girl was just trying to find

32:57.275 --> 32:58.403
a place to belong.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.572
And you, you vile insect,

33:00.578 --> 33:02.174
took that away from her.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.341
If you ask me, she killed the wrong man.

33:03.347 --> 33:04.743
Lucifer, come on.

33:04.749 --> 33:05.977
All right. Detective,

33:05.983 --> 33:08.547
this man is a professional homewrecker!

33:08.553 --> 33:09.681
And when it gets out, what he's done,

33:09.687 --> 33:10.816
he will be out of business.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.084
That will have to be punishment enough.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.886
Please.

33:14.892 --> 33:17.193
Very well, Detective.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.197
I'm not gonna lie.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.364
I was, um...

33:26.370 --> 33:28.834
I was pretty surprised
when you called me.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.402
Even more surprised

33:30.408 --> 33:32.170
you actually invited me out.

33:32.176 --> 33:35.273
You know, as soon as I walked
into that interrogation room,

33:35.279 --> 33:37.446
I felt a spark between us.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.246
Yeah?

33:41.252 --> 33:42.714
Me, too.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.416
I'm surprised you're still single.

33:44.422 --> 33:47.456
Lucky me.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.493
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you,

33:50.518 --> 33:52.491
I've been a little bit gun-shy

33:52.497 --> 33:53.959
about the whole dating thing.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.794
You know, since my split.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.296
No, I understand.

33:58.302 --> 34:01.366
I went through a bad breakup, myself.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.335
Honestly, I was in Hell

34:03.341 --> 34:04.669
for what felt like forever.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.444
I've only recently come back.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.678
What happened with you two?

34:13.684 --> 34:15.013
Was there someone else?

34:15.018 --> 34:16.348
No, no.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.382
No, nothing like that.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.684
But...

34:19.690 --> 34:21.790
But?

34:24.661 --> 34:26.591
Well, there's this-this guy

34:26.597 --> 34:28.460
that she spends a lot of time with.

34:28.466 --> 34:31.295
And he definitely has
a thing for her, but I...

34:31.302 --> 34:34.299
I mean, I don't know if
it's reciprocated, but...

34:34.304 --> 34:37.406
- you know, I...
- Go on.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.706
I think you were right, Maze.

34:41.712 --> 34:44.643
They must be discussing
some evil, terrible plans.

34:44.649 --> 34:45.976
And we must stop them.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.813
No, let's let it play out.

34:48.819 --> 34:49.652
Just to be safe.

34:54.158 --> 34:56.154
Wow. You know,

34:56.159 --> 34:58.890
I haven't really had anyone to...

34:58.896 --> 35:00.992
talk about my ex with.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.894
And it feels really good to get it out.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.764
Yes, it certainly does clarify things.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.699
Whoa, whoa, uh, wait,

35:07.705 --> 35:08.700
I'm so sorry.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.468
I, um,

35:10.474 --> 35:12.637
I totally over-shared, didn't I?

35:12.643 --> 35:14.364
I...

35:14.389 --> 35:15.707
I haven't done this in a while.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.375
And...

35:17.381 --> 35:19.511
I screwed it up.

35:19.517 --> 35:23.285
Well, I suppose I do have some time and...

35:24.221 --> 35:26.384
...you are fairly attractive.

35:26.390 --> 35:29.525
What?

35:32.997 --> 35:34.964
Oh...

35:40.719 --> 35:43.119
Oh, that's a keeper.

35:44.408 --> 35:45.437
Come on, let's go.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.738
I know where he lives.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.840
I'm not gonna go watch my
mother make out with Dan!

35:48.846 --> 35:50.342
They're not gonna make out.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.544
They're gonna...

35:52.550 --> 35:54.946
I know what they're gonna go do, Maze!

35:54.952 --> 35:56.982
Fine. I'll report back.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.350
Maze, stop.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.818
This is just a...

35:59.824 --> 36:01.786
an innocent date.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.154
An innocent date?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.724
- With Chloe's ex?
- Yeah, they're colleagues.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.158
She was in Hell for thousands of years,

36:07.164 --> 36:09.184
and he's a good enough looking... guy.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.895
Please don't make me
explain this any more.

36:10.901 --> 36:14.703
But it is so
much fun to torture you.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.235
Look,

36:17.241 --> 36:19.070
I'm not gonna interfere with my mother

36:19.076 --> 36:21.806
enjoying a little bit of happiness.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.912
Please.

36:26.217 --> 36:28.513
Fine.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.548
It's not like I wanted to watch, anyway.

36:30.554 --> 36:32.150
Even I have my limits.

36:52.943 --> 36:54.005
It's me.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.775
Forget the building,
I need a smaller charge.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.314
For say, one person.

37:00.217 --> 37:02.147
Don't worry about that.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.753
I'm going to do this one myself.

37:20.826 --> 37:22.486
Mr. Cooper, sorry to bother you.

37:22.510 --> 37:24.040
We just have a few more questions.

37:24.046 --> 37:25.808
Can your fiancée vouch for
your whereabouts

37:25.814 --> 37:27.577
the morning your father was killed?

37:27.583 --> 37:31.547
No, she was out looking for
a venue for the wedding.

37:31.553 --> 37:32.481
Why?

37:32.487 --> 37:34.116
- Well...
- What is this?

37:34.122 --> 37:36.219
I thought Eric had been
cleared of the charges.

37:36.225 --> 37:37.386
Oh, he has.

37:37.392 --> 37:38.654
Because we now know that you're the one

37:38.660 --> 37:40.274
who killed your father-in-law, Christi.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.123
What?

37:41.129 --> 37:42.925
Eric's father created fake evidence

37:42.931 --> 37:45.428
that you were cheating and tried
to blackmail you into leaving.

37:45.434 --> 37:46.495
And then he had

37:46.501 --> 37:49.265
a little champagne toast
to evil while he did it.

37:49.271 --> 37:51.312
No wonder you wanted to
jam it down his throat.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.134
I...

37:52.140 --> 37:53.603
No.

37:53.609 --> 37:54.808
No, I did it.

37:55.531 --> 37:57.173
My father, he-he showed me the evidence

37:57.179 --> 37:59.842
and I knew it was fake.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.711
Christi would never...

38:01.717 --> 38:04.180
And-and the fact that he would...

38:04.186 --> 38:07.383
stoop so low, I couldn't help myself.

38:07.389 --> 38:08.784
I flew into a rage.

38:08.790 --> 38:10.453
Well, if that's the case,

38:10.459 --> 38:12.088
Eric Cooper, you're under arrest...

38:12.094 --> 38:13.260
No!

38:14.496 --> 38:16.592
It was me. It happened

38:16.598 --> 38:17.793
all like you said.

38:17.799 --> 38:19.028
Christi...

38:19.034 --> 38:20.963
I'm-I'm the one who did it, not Eric.

38:20.969 --> 38:22.031
I think he did it.

38:22.037 --> 38:23.966
You two realize that if
you confess to this crime,

38:23.972 --> 38:25.839
there's a good chance
you both will go to jail?

38:27.681 --> 38:29.205
Whatever we face,

38:29.211 --> 38:31.574
we face together.

38:31.580 --> 38:34.154
I don't understand.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.902
The one of you who didn't do it,
you'll lose everything.

38:38.754 --> 38:40.887
No, we won't.

38:48.130 --> 38:49.859
No one was willing to stand next to you

38:49.865 --> 38:51.260
in front of the bulldozers?

38:51.266 --> 38:53.696
No.

38:53.702 --> 38:55.331
No, I sent everybody home.

38:56.605 --> 38:59.869
Thought I'd say my good-byes on my own.

38:59.875 --> 39:01.804
Good-byes?

39:01.810 --> 39:04.050
I thought you were gonna
fight for this place.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.475
Well, it occurred to me that

39:06.481 --> 39:08.678
much as I love this place, uh,

39:08.684 --> 39:11.447
I can always build a new one.

39:11.472 --> 39:13.792
I mean, it wasn't the walls
that made it my home.

39:13.817 --> 39:15.851
The people.

39:15.857 --> 39:16.852
Yes.

39:16.858 --> 39:18.487
Well, the women.

39:18.493 --> 39:21.157
But they'll flock to any new
place I go to, so...

39:21.163 --> 39:22.291
Hmm.

39:22.297 --> 39:27.300
Well, that makes this
sort of anticlimactic.

39:28.236 --> 39:30.099
But Lux has been named

39:30.105 --> 39:33.102
a Heritage Site by Los Angeles County.

39:33.108 --> 39:34.070
Detective, is this...

39:34.076 --> 39:35.871
I had a friend in the city council

39:35.877 --> 39:36.872
push it through.

39:36.878 --> 39:38.107
And I used your, uh,

39:38.113 --> 39:40.076
little history lesson as inspiration.

39:40.082 --> 39:41.844
Lux is protected now.

39:41.850 --> 39:44.680
It can't be demolished for development.

39:44.686 --> 39:47.083
Detective, you...

39:49.591 --> 39:51.424
you saved my home.

39:52.061 --> 39:53.856
Well, you'd still have to buy it back

39:53.862 --> 39:56.559
from Eleanor Bloom,
I'm sure well above market price.

39:56.565 --> 39:58.794
But...

39:58.800 --> 39:59.829
you can afford it.

40:02.904 --> 40:04.500
I...

40:04.506 --> 40:06.369
I-I mean, I simply don't
know what to say.

40:06.375 --> 40:08.104
I'm-I'm normally the one
doing the favors.

40:08.110 --> 40:10.006
And for a price.

40:10.012 --> 40:12.278
Friends help each other out.

40:15.017 --> 40:16.012
Yeah, well,

40:16.018 --> 40:18.414
let me at least buy you dinner tonight.

40:18.420 --> 40:19.415
To celebrate.

40:19.421 --> 40:21.417
I know this amazing steakhouse

40:21.423 --> 40:23.619
and-and the chef's an absolute
artist in the kitchen.

40:23.625 --> 40:24.954
I mean, he's also a degenerate gambler

40:24.960 --> 40:26.059
and owes me a favor.

40:27.389 --> 40:28.691
Otherwise, you'll just go home

40:28.716 --> 40:30.450
and eat one of those poisonous sandwiches

40:30.475 --> 40:32.228
you get from the vending machine at work.

40:32.234 --> 40:34.730
Come on, Detective.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.536
Friends help each other out.

40:37.439 --> 40:39.101
She saved Lux.

40:39.107 --> 40:41.137
No strings attached.

40:41.143 --> 40:43.139
I-I didn't even ask.

40:43.145 --> 40:44.607
Well, Chloe saw that your home

40:44.613 --> 40:46.909
is a very important place to you.

40:46.915 --> 40:48.978
Does it really surprise you

40:48.984 --> 40:50.911
that she'd want to help you protect it?

40:50.936 --> 40:52.314
Well, I...

40:52.320 --> 40:53.649
People make gestures like that

40:53.655 --> 40:54.950
all the time.

40:54.956 --> 40:57.653
You just saw two people
go to jail for each other.

40:57.659 --> 40:59.622
But those people were clearly insane.

40:59.628 --> 41:01.426
Now their home is a jail cell.

41:01.451 --> 41:04.827
You realized earlier that "home"
meant more to you than Lux.

41:04.833 --> 41:06.262
That you could lose Lux

41:06.268 --> 41:07.730
and still have a place here.

41:07.736 --> 41:09.398
Because Los Angeles is my home.

41:09.404 --> 41:10.666
Lux or no.

41:10.672 --> 41:13.469
Are you sure that's what
you were really looking for?

41:13.475 --> 41:15.571
Well, what else would it be?

41:15.577 --> 41:16.972
Something occurred to me

41:16.978 --> 41:18.307
when you introduced me to your mother.

41:18.313 --> 41:19.942
Why is it that

41:19.948 --> 41:21.710
I'm the only human in your life

41:21.716 --> 41:23.712
who knows who you really are?

41:23.718 --> 41:25.481
Because you asked me, remember?

41:25.487 --> 41:27.249
You insisted that I show you.

41:27.255 --> 41:30.152
Detective Decker has
asked you many times.

41:30.158 --> 41:31.620
And I always tell her the truth.

41:31.626 --> 41:33.456
But you know she doesn't believe you.

41:33.462 --> 41:35.191
You could show her

41:35.197 --> 41:37.460
your true face,

41:37.466 --> 41:38.932
but you don't.

41:40.368 --> 41:42.235
Why is that?

41:44.206 --> 41:45.835
Do you think it's because

41:45.841 --> 41:48.037
you might be afraid

41:48.043 --> 41:49.505
of how she might react?

41:49.511 --> 41:51.440
Because you care

41:51.446 --> 41:53.876
that much about what she thinks of you?

41:53.882 --> 41:55.478
No, I-I-I'm sorry.

41:55.484 --> 41:56.879
Doctor, I don't really understand

41:56.885 --> 41:58.080
where you're going with this.

41:58.086 --> 42:00.683
I think you did come to Los Angeles

42:00.689 --> 42:02.151
looking for something.

42:02.157 --> 42:05.087
But I also think you've stopped.

42:05.093 --> 42:08.094
Because maybe you've found it.
