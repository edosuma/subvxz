WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:09.572
Okay, guys, time's almost up.

00:09.943 --> 00:14.141
How do they expect you to form words
with all the letters mixed up like that?

00:14.466 --> 00:18.778
- That's the point of the game, Woody.
- Hey, Sam, where's Diane?

00:19.112 --> 00:21.626
She's been burning the midnight oil,
studying for exams.

00:21.892 --> 00:23.883
I'm letting her catch a few winks
in the office.

00:24.174 --> 00:28.133
She couldn't catch winks if she walked
naked through a troop train.

00:29.277 --> 00:32.235
Say, I wonder if she's dreaming
about me.

00:32.512 --> 00:34.310
Fat chance.

00:34.877 --> 00:37.107
That's it, time's up.
What do you got? You first.

00:37.408 --> 00:40.366
I've got "reap," "pear" and "ear."

00:41.432 --> 00:44.390
Well, I'm sorry, Woody. I got those
too, so it cancels yours out.

00:44.668 --> 00:48.422
But I've also got "flork," "ferd"
and "snot."

00:49.813 --> 00:53.089
Come on, man, there's no such
word as "flork."

00:53.381 --> 00:56.259
What are you talking about? You know
those little flags on the mailboxes?

00:56.534 --> 00:58.490
What do you think holds them on?

01:01.305 --> 01:03.694
Gee, Mr Clavin, you're so smart
I don't even know why

01:03.960 --> 01:05.791
I bother playing with you.
You always win.

01:06.076 --> 01:08.226
You know what I say, Woody?
You just gotta be tenacious,

01:08.482 --> 01:10.552
just like the great horned "muren."

01:10.805 --> 01:13.524
Hey, well, besides, you almost
beat me in the last game.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.992
Yeah, just missed by a cat's "pleck."

01:18.080 --> 01:19.991
Yep.

02:40.780 --> 02:43.578
Boy, that's some storm
out there tonight, huh, Mr Clavin?

02:43.866 --> 02:46.539
Well, to the layman perhaps, Woody.

02:46.828 --> 02:48.944
But in my profession we have
a saying:

02:49.247 --> 02:52.205
"Neither rain nor sleet nor gloom
of night shall stay this courier from

02:52.499 --> 02:55.571
the swift completion
of his appointed rounds."

02:56.670 --> 02:59.821
Cliff, my car is stalled outside. How
about getting me your jumper cables?

03:00.131 --> 03:02.281
What, and catch my death?

03:02.717 --> 03:04.867
Hit the bricks.

03:05.136 --> 03:06.728
Appreciate it.

03:07.012 --> 03:09.765
Sam, table six wants a bottle
of the house red.

03:10.099 --> 03:12.055
Woody, would you mind going
down to the wine cellar

03:12.309 --> 03:14.539
- and getting some more, please?
- Of course not.

03:14.811 --> 03:18.247
You know, I used to be afraid
of the dark, but I got myself over it.

03:18.607 --> 03:19.835
Oh, yeah? How'd you do that?

03:20.108 --> 03:23.578
Oh, well, I just shut my eyes
and pretended it wasn't there.

03:26.823 --> 03:28.700
Wine cellar?

03:28.950 --> 03:32.147
Since when have we had a wine
cellar? Vodka rocks, please.

03:32.495 --> 03:35.805
On your day off, I had a couple
of workers checking the plumbing,

03:36.123 --> 03:38.591
and they discovered that there
was a staircase

03:38.876 --> 03:40.389
behind the wall in the closet there.

03:42.713 --> 03:45.386
That's amazing. You mean
it's just been there all this time?

03:45.674 --> 03:49.553
Yeah. A long time ago, when this
was just a private house here,

03:49.886 --> 03:53.435
the owners used to keep their crazy
old grandmother down there.

03:53.765 --> 03:57.474
They say that if you're real quiet,
you can hear her chains rattle.

03:57.852 --> 04:02.368
Supposedly, she swore to seek
vengeance on blond waitresses.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.936
Very funny.

04:07.694 --> 04:10.333
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

04:10.614 --> 04:12.684
- Norman.
- Still pouring, Norm?

04:13.492 --> 04:16.564
That's funny. I was about to ask you
the same thing.

04:21.082 --> 04:22.834
Hey, some storm, huh?

04:23.125 --> 04:26.481
Yeah. If I don't get home to Vera soon,
that road's gonna be closed.

04:26.796 --> 04:29.868
Say about another half hour or so
ought to do it.

04:31.133 --> 04:34.170
Hey, Sam, where's the paper? I wanna
see what they say about the storm.

04:34.511 --> 04:36.581
Woody had it a minute ago.
Where is he anyway?

04:36.888 --> 04:39.243
Better go check on him.

04:39.599 --> 04:42.830
It's been a whole week since
I taught him how to climb stairs.

04:43.728 --> 04:46.196
- Oh, here it is. Wait a minute.
- I'll take that, Sammy.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.869
I told Vera I'd check
for double coupons.

04:49.191 --> 04:52.103
Oh, Norman, that's very sweet.

04:52.445 --> 04:55.755
Yeah, you know, Diane,
marriage is a full-time job.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.699
Oh, hey, Diane. Remember that
lunatic that tried to

05:01.078 --> 05:03.751
strangle you while you were doing
that scene from Othello up there?

05:04.039 --> 05:06.314
Oh, yeah, what was his name?
Andy Schroeder?

05:06.583 --> 05:07.857
- There he is.
- What about him?

05:08.084 --> 05:10.917
It says here that he escaped
from the state--

05:11.254 --> 05:13.085
- Whoa, she does remember him.
- Yeah.

05:14.173 --> 05:16.926
Anyway, it says here he could
be dangerous. I don't know.

05:17.218 --> 05:19.413
Hey, hey, come on, Normie,
what's it say about the storm?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.154
Sam, didn't you hear that?

05:22.431 --> 05:24.467
Andy-Andy, the man who tried
to kill me, is loose.

05:24.766 --> 05:27.564
Hey, calm down. No lunatic's
gonna go out on a night like this.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.930
He'd have to be nuts.

05:31.481 --> 05:35.235
Boy, I hope my new wine cellar stays
dry. Where are those guys anyway?

05:35.609 --> 05:37.600
- I'll go investigate for you, Sammy.
- Thank you.

05:37.903 --> 05:40.497
Yeah, I've been anxious to check out
your salon de vin anyway.

05:40.781 --> 05:42.453
Hey, look, if I'm any more
than five minutes,

05:42.700 --> 05:45.214
send down some cheese
and crackers, huh?

05:49.956 --> 05:51.548
Kind of a spooky night, huh?

05:52.417 --> 05:56.888
Sam, how can you be so calm
knowing this man is free?

05:57.255 --> 05:58.847
You've never taken him seriously.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.524
Just because he smiles at you
with that pink-cheeked,

06:01.801 --> 06:04.918
round kewpie doll face and says,
"Hi there," you think he's harmless.

06:05.220 --> 06:08.929
Well, he's not. He's a cold-blooded
homicidal maniac.

06:09.266 --> 06:14.420
Hey, no guy is gonna walk in here
into this brightly lit bar and attack you.

06:20.443 --> 06:24.197
- Probably not in a dark one either.
- Oh, Sam!

06:24.530 --> 06:27.203
What? Now, come on, everybody,
just relax here. I got candles now.

06:27.492 --> 06:29.483
That's right, everybody,
just keep calm, all right?

06:29.743 --> 06:32.337
I mean, no reason to panic here.

06:32.621 --> 06:36.170
Sammy, those taps operate
when the power is out, don't they?

06:39.961 --> 06:42.600
Why haven't the others come up
from the wine cellar?

06:42.922 --> 06:44.878
They sure have a knack
for picking the wrong time

06:45.133 --> 06:48.011
- to goof off, don't they?
- All right, I'll go roust those guys out.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.798
Or else I'll just have to bury
their bodies.

06:56.144 --> 07:00.376
All right, that's it.
I'm calling the power company.

07:03.859 --> 07:06.692
God, Sam, the phone is dead.

07:07.028 --> 07:11.783
Oh, you're kidding. Wow, no phone,
no power. Cut off from the outside

07:12.158 --> 07:15.468
world on a stormy night with
a homicidal maniac on the loose.

07:18.581 --> 07:21.254
Isn't that always just the way?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.231
God, that was Norman!

07:26.463 --> 07:29.102
- What's happening?
- Oh, come on, whoa!

07:29.382 --> 07:31.532
You are such a sucker.
Don't you see what's happening?

07:31.801 --> 07:33.553
They know you found out
about Andy,

07:33.804 --> 07:35.556
and they're just trying
to scare you to death.

07:35.805 --> 07:38.763
Why don't you go down there
and just get it over with?

07:41.394 --> 07:43.988
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.632
Oh, of course that's it.

07:49.026 --> 07:53.542
Oh, I am such a goose.

07:56.199 --> 08:00.112
What should I expect
from this devilish crew?

08:00.453 --> 08:03.365
Here I come. I'm opening the door.

08:10.629 --> 08:14.019
Oh, I hope nobody's down here.

08:14.341 --> 08:20.735
Because it sure would scare me if
people yelled out a bloodcurdling boo.

08:21.181 --> 08:26.414
Well, looks like the candle is in
on your little joke too.

08:27.729 --> 08:30.289
Why won't this light?

08:31.107 --> 08:32.460
Hi there.

08:34.277 --> 08:35.505
What? What?

08:37.779 --> 08:39.053
Oh, God.

08:40.616 --> 08:45.007
I just had the worst nightmare
of my entire life.

08:46.246 --> 08:49.602
By the way, Sam,
you were beastly to me.

08:52.544 --> 08:54.262
Oh, really? Well, how was l?

08:54.754 --> 08:56.790
You weren't in it.

08:58.424 --> 09:00.142
Of course.

09:00.509 --> 09:03.660
Beastly? Can you be specific?

09:04.971 --> 09:06.927
- All right.
- Sam, l--

09:07.182 --> 09:10.652
I don't think Diane's dreams are
anything you should be meddling in.

09:10.977 --> 09:14.447
Maybe you're right. Starring in them
is enough, I guess.

09:17.525 --> 09:20.676
You were having another one
of those dreams, weren't you?

09:20.987 --> 09:24.741
Yes. But it wasn't as bad this time.

09:25.116 --> 09:28.108
Diane, you've got to stop this
nonsense about Andy-Andy.

09:28.411 --> 09:30.163
You've been dreaming
about him for months now,

09:30.412 --> 09:33.006
since you found out he was released
from the state mental hospital.

09:33.290 --> 09:37.203
Can you blame me?
The man tried to kill me, Frasier.

09:37.544 --> 09:41.298
Look, Diane. Listen, I've--
I've talked with him.

09:41.965 --> 09:43.114
You what?

09:43.382 --> 09:45.213
Yes, as soon as you started
having those dreams,

09:45.468 --> 09:47.698
I found out where Andy was living,
and I went to see him.

09:48.012 --> 09:50.003
I wanted to learn if your fears
were unfounded, and,

09:50.264 --> 09:51.492
believe me, they are, Diane.

09:51.766 --> 09:53.358
I've counselled him
for several weeks now,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.591
and his progress has been remarkable.

09:55.853 --> 09:58.128
Frasier, I don't believe this.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.833
I want you to confront this fear.

10:02.150 --> 10:04.584
I mean, just talk to the man.

10:04.861 --> 10:08.251
Never. Never, never, never!

10:08.573 --> 10:11.690
Diane, I sense resistance.

10:12.201 --> 10:13.998
Diane, I heard screams.

10:14.328 --> 10:17.126
Oh, well, I dreamt
I was being murdered.

10:17.457 --> 10:20.051
Was I the one
who was murdering you?

10:20.334 --> 10:23.132
- No.
- Was I helping in any way?

10:25.339 --> 10:29.014
Sam, I'm still a bit shaken up.
May I have the rest

10:29.342 --> 10:30.900
- of the evening off, please?
- You bet.

10:31.135 --> 10:32.204
Thank you.

10:33.013 --> 10:37.006
She came in, she fell asleep,
and now she's going home.

10:37.600 --> 10:42.754
Diane, what you need now is a little
TLC. Tender, loving Crane.

10:43.439 --> 10:47.637
Well, thanks anyway.
I'm sure I'll be fine.

10:48.109 --> 10:50.987
After that nightmare, maybe now
I can sleep through the night

10:51.280 --> 10:54.909
without being haunted
by that homicidal cherub.

10:55.242 --> 10:58.200
Listen, at least let me drive you home.
When you're this close to hysteria,

10:58.494 --> 11:02.453
you need the calming influence
of a strong and mature man.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.570
Hi there.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.014
- Diane?
- Yes.

11:15.335 --> 11:17.371
The reason I came here is to tell you

11:17.628 --> 11:20.188
how deeply sorry I am that I hurt you.

11:20.504 --> 11:23.541
And I also want you to know that
I'm leaving the country.

11:23.839 --> 11:27.434
And it would mean so much to me
if I had your forgiveness.

11:28.091 --> 11:30.525
Fine, you're forgiven. Now get out.

11:31.385 --> 11:35.139
You can wish the man bon voyage
at least, for God's sake.

11:37.471 --> 11:39.189
You're right.

11:39.722 --> 11:43.476
Andy, I hope everything works out
for the best.

11:43.849 --> 11:46.158
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes.

11:46.476 --> 11:48.273
Well, then maybe you can help me.

11:48.518 --> 11:54.150
I've fallen in love with a wonderful girl,
and we're going to get married.

11:55.147 --> 11:57.024
And I'd like you to meet her.

11:57.315 --> 11:59.146
- There's just one hitch.
- You killed her.

11:59.649 --> 12:00.764
Hey, hey.

12:06.653 --> 12:11.443
She-- She doesn't know about
my prison background.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.254
So I've-- I've told her a few tiny fibs.

12:15.574 --> 12:17.644
Like I have friends and a life.

12:19.409 --> 12:22.048
And I've adopted you people to be it.

12:22.327 --> 12:26.161
She's coming here to meet you all,
and I hope you'll back me up.

12:26.538 --> 12:30.850
- l-- I don't know about this, Andrew.
- I disapprove.

12:31.207 --> 12:34.244
Well, wait a second now. If I could just
throw in my two cents worth here,

12:34.542 --> 12:37.215
I really couldn't give a damn
one way or the other.

12:38.419 --> 12:42.492
Please, l-- All I'm asking is for what
society promised me.

12:42.879 --> 12:45.268
A chance to start over.

12:46.173 --> 12:48.004
Wait a second here. Frasier, Diane,

12:48.299 --> 12:50.813
Iet me talk to you over here
for a minute, will you?

12:51.092 --> 12:54.004
We'll be right back.
Hold on a sec. Come here.

12:55.302 --> 12:58.260
Come on, let's sit down
over here. Listen.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.591
Is Andy cured, or isn't he?

13:02.890 --> 13:07.281
Well, Sam, a trained psychiatrist
never uses the term "cured."

13:07.642 --> 13:09.394
Unless we're talking about ham.

13:10.185 --> 13:11.937
That's pretty good.

13:12.686 --> 13:14.756
No, to wax serious,

13:15.021 --> 13:20.778
Andy's progress has been remarkable,
and, well, I'll-- I'll vouch for his stability.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.510
Well, then I say let's help him.

13:22.775 --> 13:26.051
I mean, we'll be giving both of them
a new chance on life there.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.478
By George, Sam, sometimes
out of the mouths of babes.

13:30.821 --> 13:34.291
No, let's not talk women now.
What do you say, huh?

13:36.032 --> 13:39.104
I'm not so sure about this.

13:39.408 --> 13:44.721
Well, Diane, instead of dwelling on
the bad person that Andy used to be,

13:45.161 --> 13:48.233
we reinforce the good person
he wants to be.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.858
Oh, come on, loosen up, will you?

13:51.123 --> 13:54.798
It might even be fun if you'd unclench
your keister long enough.

13:55.958 --> 13:57.516
That was pretty good.

13:57.793 --> 14:01.627
Hey, come on. Andy?
Andy, we're with you.

14:02.003 --> 14:03.277
I really appreciate it.

14:03.504 --> 14:08.419
Listen, before she gets here, let me
coach you on the little lies I told her.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.432
My God, she's early.

14:10.758 --> 14:13.067
What am I gonna do?

14:13.342 --> 14:16.812
Please, everybody,
whatever I say, just go along.

14:17.136 --> 14:18.694
- Trust me.
- All right.

14:20.679 --> 14:25.389
- Andy.
- Cynthia.

14:26.015 --> 14:29.485
- Everybody, this is Cynthia.
- Hello, Cynthia.

14:29.851 --> 14:30.886
- Hi.
- Hi, Cynthia.

14:31.351 --> 14:35.424
I've heard so much about you all.

14:36.104 --> 14:39.733
Andy, I really love your bar.

14:42.357 --> 14:44.712
Andy's bar?

14:45.025 --> 14:47.459
Oh, you must be Sam.

14:47.777 --> 14:50.530
Yes, that's right, I'm Sam.

14:51.028 --> 14:55.226
I'm really glad to see you putting
your life back together again.

14:55.572 --> 14:58.291
Well, I'm-- I'm trying.

14:58.824 --> 15:04.057
Well, I really admire Andy's philosophy
on giving ex-cons a second chance.

15:05.244 --> 15:07.758
Even a flasher.

15:11.372 --> 15:14.125
Well, you know what they say,
if you've got it, why not--?

15:14.415 --> 15:15.894
Sam.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.843
You must be Diane.

15:21.127 --> 15:24.483
- lndeed I am.
- Poor, poor Diane.

15:24.837 --> 15:27.635
Yes. Well...

15:27.964 --> 15:31.240
No, really, it's all right. It's all right,
he's told me everything.

15:31.549 --> 15:33.267
What did he tell you?

15:33.883 --> 15:36.875
How you so wanted to have his child.

15:40.095 --> 15:42.404
And this, of course, is Frasier Crane.

15:42.721 --> 15:47.158
Oh, the poor wretch
you've been counselling.

15:50.225 --> 15:52.785
Yes, he's helped me quite a bit.

15:53.101 --> 15:59.540
I hope so. Are you still having trouble
with that little habit?

16:00.647 --> 16:01.841
Habit?

16:02.106 --> 16:05.655
- What little habit is that, Fras?
- Yeah, Frasier.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.231
Do tell, do tell.

16:08.526 --> 16:10.994
It's an illness. He's not ashamed of it.

16:11.277 --> 16:13.154
- Are you, Frasier?
- Oh, certainly not.

16:13.404 --> 16:17.363
Not exactly. Well, not entirely.

16:17.697 --> 16:20.450
- It all depends on the--
- He's a kleptomaniac.

16:21.824 --> 16:24.213
And not making
much progress, I'm afraid.

16:24.493 --> 16:26.051
He shoplifted his entire wardrobe.

16:26.285 --> 16:31.200
Well, not all of it, but these pants
are pretty hot.

16:33.914 --> 16:35.347
Sam, are we having a good night?

16:35.582 --> 16:38.142
- How much have I got in the register?
- Oh, I don't know.

16:38.416 --> 16:40.771
It's been pretty slow. Probably no more
than about 50 bucks.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.035
Are you kidding?
We must have 1,000 in here.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.248
- Thank you, Woody.
- I just thought the owner should know.

16:47.588 --> 16:49.067
I'll need the cash for my trip.

16:49.547 --> 16:52.857
- Oh, Andy, I don't know about that.
- Oh, Sam, loosen up.

16:53.174 --> 16:56.086
Unclench your cash register.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.313
Listen, Andy, how about tearing up
all my unpaid bar chits

17:02.637 --> 17:05.070
- as kind of a little going-away present?
- Norm, you're a good

17:05.347 --> 17:07.303
and valued customer,
but I can't do that.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.279
- Nice try there, Norm.
- Do it yourself, big guy.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.750
- All right. Hey.
- Hey, that's great, Andy.

17:14.059 --> 17:17.335
- Hey, how about me, pal?
- Not a chance.

17:19.561 --> 17:23.714
Well, it looks like you did a little better
than I thought you did there, Andy.

17:24.106 --> 17:27.415
Let's see here. One hundred, 200--

17:27.733 --> 17:30.691
Oh, don't bother counting it, Sam.
I'll just take it all.

17:31.193 --> 17:33.582
Say, look at the time.
We have to fly.

17:34.070 --> 17:38.029
Diane, baby, for old time's sake.

17:41.240 --> 17:45.631
The man just gives and gives
and gives.

17:47.035 --> 17:52.667
Sam, take care of my bar
and take care of this little gal of mine.

17:53.913 --> 17:55.585
It was nice meeting you all.

17:55.831 --> 18:00.268
Oh, us too. And by the way,
I love your choker.

18:00.833 --> 18:02.391
I'm not wearing a choker.

18:02.626 --> 18:05.823
- You will be.
- Come along there. Bye.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.130
Sam.

18:08.379 --> 18:12.088
You have to stop Andy.
He's taking all your money.

18:12.423 --> 18:14.015
He'll be back. Just give him a chance.

18:14.257 --> 18:18.808
Are you crazy? He's never
coming back. I'm calling the police.

18:19.218 --> 18:22.369
Oh, come on, l--
He's coming back, Diane.

18:22.678 --> 18:25.431
You know, I've made jokes about
your dearth of living brain cells,

18:25.721 --> 18:29.953
but it's not funny anymore.
Don't you get tired of being wrong?

18:30.307 --> 18:33.105
- Thank you, everybody.
- Hold it a second, Andy,

18:33.392 --> 18:34.984
Diane's making a fool of herself here.

18:35.226 --> 18:38.662
Sam, you guys made me look like
a big shot in Cynthia's eyes.

18:39.019 --> 18:40.657
You guys were wonderful.

18:40.895 --> 18:43.284
- I'll never forget you.
- Well...

18:43.563 --> 18:46.635
I'm most touched that you
trusted me, Diane. You,

18:47.691 --> 18:50.728
who had reason to fear
and to hate me the most.

18:51.651 --> 18:54.324
- Sam.
- Oh, yeah.

18:55.570 --> 18:57.322
Goodbye.

19:04.199 --> 19:07.794
Sam, I'm sorry, l-- Sam, wait.

19:10.661 --> 19:12.731
How could I have been so wrong?

19:12.995 --> 19:15.555
A lifetime of practice.

19:17.831 --> 19:19.742
Sam?

19:21.208 --> 19:25.087
Sam, I'm sorry. I feel awful.

19:25.418 --> 19:28.649
You were right.
Please accept my apology.

19:28.962 --> 19:31.635
Oh, forget it, Diane. I forgive you.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.593
The quality of mercy is not strained.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.557
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven

19:35.798 --> 19:38.312
upon the place beneath.
It is twice blest.

19:38.592 --> 19:42.187
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

19:42.552 --> 19:45.908
Thank you, Sam. What did you say?

19:46.554 --> 19:48.590
I think you heard me.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.445
Yes, but you said it.

19:53.099 --> 19:57.012
Well, perhaps in his pithy way,
Blake said it best.

19:57.351 --> 19:58.943
Oh, yes.

20:00.353 --> 20:06.064
And throughout eternity
I forgive you, and you forgive me.

20:11.525 --> 20:16.724
- I can't believe my ears.
- Oh, come on, Diane.

20:19.904 --> 20:24.182
You really didn't believe that buffoonish
façade that I've been perpetrating

20:24.532 --> 20:27.842
for the benefit
of my blue-collar clientele, did you?

20:28.992 --> 20:31.825
Oh, my God.

20:32.911 --> 20:35.471
My heart is racing, Sam.

20:35.787 --> 20:40.497
Oh, dear. Well, I know just the thing.

20:41.165 --> 20:45.636
Perhaps a spot of chamomile tea
would calm you down.

20:49.044 --> 20:51.433
There you go. Please.

20:52.004 --> 20:57.601
- Careful.
- Sam, I never found you so attractive.

20:58.049 --> 21:03.123
Oh, well, how nice.
Listen, before we take this any further,

21:03.552 --> 21:06.988
would you mind sitting down?
I'd love to play you a little something

21:07.303 --> 21:09.771
from an opera that I've been writing.

21:10.680 --> 21:15.117
It's-- It's based on the Old Testament.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.988
It combines the brooding
intensity of Mahler

21:18.267 --> 21:23.022
with the pesky insouciance of Poulenc,
and it goes something like this.

21:45.906 --> 21:47.737
Sam?

21:49.033 --> 21:50.307
Sam?

21:50.534 --> 21:54.766
Take me. Now. I want you.

21:55.161 --> 21:57.277
Put the keyboard away,

21:57.537 --> 22:01.849
and let me be the instrument
you play on.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.563
- Diane?
- Yes.

22:06.876 --> 22:10.789
Do you realize you just ended
that proposition with a preposition?

22:11.878 --> 22:13.994
Just have me.

22:14.254 --> 22:16.085
Have me.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.415
Oh, Diane.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.108
Diane.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.938
Diane, Diane? Hey.

22:30.388 --> 22:32.344
Sam.

22:32.639 --> 22:35.472
This may be a silly question,

22:35.765 --> 22:39.644
but you don't have a velvet
smoking jacket, do you?

22:39.976 --> 22:43.571
Hey, come on, I'm smoking
in any jacket.

22:46.521 --> 22:49.672
- What is this? What's going on?
- But of course.

22:50.231 --> 22:53.940
I just had the weirdest dream.

22:54.608 --> 23:00.240
I thought I was waking up from
a dream, but I was in another dream.

23:00.653 --> 23:03.565
Andy-Andy came back.
Oh, it was terrible.

23:03.905 --> 23:08.456
And there was a wine cellar here.
And we all went into it.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.777
And Frasier was a kleptomaniac,
and you were smart.

23:12.117 --> 23:14.267
When did it get weird?

23:15.911 --> 23:18.379
Hey, Sam? You wanna come
continue this word game?

23:18.662 --> 23:20.618
Woody's on the brink
of forming a syllable.

23:20.872 --> 23:24.069
Oh, yeah. Whoa, wait a second.

23:24.373 --> 23:27.171
You never told me how that
dream ended. Did you and l...?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.218
Certainly not.

23:29.700 --> 23:33.090
Oh, well, that really was
a bad dream, wasn't it?
