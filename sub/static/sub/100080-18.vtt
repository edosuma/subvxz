Previously onSWAT...HICKS:
17-year-old Raymont Harris

00:10.314 --> 00:13.622
was accidentally shot
by team leader Buck Spivey.

00:13.665 --> 00:14.927
I spent my life
serving this city,

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
and I undid everything
I had accomplished

00:17.104 --> 00:18.409
with a single mistake.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.063
We're looking to launch
a private security firm.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.891
I've struggled a bunchsince leaving SWAT.

00:21.934 --> 00:22.935
I mean, this could be
big for me.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.502
All right, let's do this.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.764
Where does Buck fit
into all this?

00:25.808 --> 00:27.592
He can't be the name
or face of this company.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.724
You can.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.073
Concert promoter's pissed.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.509
He hasn't been able
to reach Buck all day.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.468
So what happens to Buck?

00:35.470 --> 00:37.907
Most times, I...

00:37.950 --> 00:41.606
I work stuff out by talking
to my family or friends.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.871
I know they have my back.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.830
And that keeps me grounded.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.095
But...

00:54.141 --> 00:57.579
...today's the first time I feltlike I really needed this.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.363
Because of what happened.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.800
Yeah.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.628
That really sucked.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.109
Maybe it'd be easier
if we talk about it,

01:06.153 --> 01:07.632
from the beginning.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.203
It started with Hondo.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.382
AUTOMATED VOICE:
We're sorry.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.645
The voice mailbox
you've reached is full.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.302
Everything okay, babe?

01:25.346 --> 01:28.262
Yeah, a pipe burst overnight
at the community center.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.394
Got to get in and see
how bad the damage is.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.483
You got a sump pump
you keep handy?

01:32.527 --> 01:33.919
Oh, I'm fresh out, boo.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.096
I swear that place is gonna
drive me to bankruptcy.

01:36.139 --> 01:37.140
It's always something.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.576
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.795
What's up?

01:39.838 --> 01:41.318
I just can't get ahold of Buck.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.841
Your old team leader?

01:42.885 --> 01:44.887
Something wrong?No one's seen him in a few days.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.410
And Deacon mentioned
something was off about him,

01:46.454 --> 01:48.282
and now he's not answering
anybody's calls.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.284
Quick trip to Vegas maybe?I don't know.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.155
He's fell off the grid like thisa couple times before

01:52.199 --> 01:53.635
when something was wrong,
so I'm just gonna

01:53.678 --> 01:54.984
stop by his place and check in.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.551
I think you should.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.466
Love you.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.120
Bye.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.165

[doorbell rings]

02:07.779 --> 02:09.694
[knocking]

02:13.307 --> 02:15.178
All right, Buck keeps
a spare key around back.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.876
That's what got me in the last
time I was worried about him.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.402
Buck?

02:21.445 --> 02:23.447
You home?

02:24.622 --> 02:26.320
Check the rooms and the garage.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.712
Yeah.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.026
STREET:No sign of him.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.854
Car's gone, too.

02:38.897 --> 02:42.466
Man, I know Buck likes to throwa few back, but this is...

02:42.510 --> 02:44.294
it's a lot.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.081
His phone's dead.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.042
Found these in the bedroom.
Sleeping pills.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.218
Rest of the rooms
look like this one?

02:55.262 --> 02:56.524
Yeah.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.482
Looks like the last
couple of calls

02:58.526 --> 03:00.310
went to an Owen Bennett
yesterday.
Yeah.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.225
That's our business partner
at the private security firm.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227
There's only one other call
to a 1-800 number.

Please remain on the...How long was the call?

03:20.591 --> 03:22.985
It says one minute, which meansit could've been less.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.248
He might've justcalled and hung up.Gun safe's empty, too.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.641
Get ahold of
the rest of 20-Squad.

03:26.684 --> 03:27.946
We got to track Buck down now.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.948
How do you plan on doing that?I'm not sure.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.254
But I got a real bad feeling

03:31.298 --> 03:32.908
we don't have time
to get it wrong.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.953
♪

04:09.771 --> 04:12.295
Dad used to hate it
when Captain McClintock

04:12.339 --> 04:13.949
made him do these sessions.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.386
Why's that?He thought they were B.S.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.607
That anyone who needed therapy
wasn't fit to be a cop.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.436
He used to tell me, "How can youtrust somebody to have your back

04:22.479 --> 04:24.394
when they don't even havetheir own issues squared away?"

04:24.438 --> 04:26.353
I see hundreds of officersevery year, Luca.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.006
Do you feelthat way about them?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.051
No.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.445
I mean, I get why we do it now.

04:31.488 --> 04:34.448
Especially after
a day like today.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.884
[sighs]

04:37.189 --> 04:40.149
Well, Buck was old school
like my pops.

04:40.192 --> 04:43.021
He didn't like talking
to the cop shrink, either.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.112
Maybe it would've helped him.

04:47.156 --> 04:50.028
Has what happened today
given you second thoughts

04:50.072 --> 04:52.074
about getting back
into the field?

04:52.117 --> 04:54.816
Nah, I can't wait
to get back out there.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.081
But I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't worried.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.083
[softly]:Hmm.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.607
I mean, what if I can't?

05:05.435 --> 05:06.828
I already failed
one fitness test.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.396
I thought it was
because of my hip.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.792
What if it's really...
[sighs]

05:14.836 --> 05:16.228
up here, you know?

05:18.013 --> 05:20.450
That's not so easy to fix.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.061
Is losing SWAT
something you're afraid of?

05:24.933 --> 05:26.674
For as long as SWAT's existed,

05:26.717 --> 05:29.285
there's always been
a Luca on the team.

05:30.895 --> 05:34.203
Without it...

05:34.246 --> 05:36.248
I don't know who I am.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.255
Maybe that's how Buck felt, too.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.565
Hey, what's the word, Hondo?

05:48.609 --> 05:50.262
Buck's been AWOL for 48 hours

05:50.306 --> 05:53.048
and we think he might behaving suicidal thoughts.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.398
Put the word out with patrols,
some of his old metro buddies.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.531
They're gonna reach out
if they locate him.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.533
Hopefully, it's not too late.What? What's that
supposed to mean?

05:59.576 --> 06:01.709
Buck's not here andwe don't know where he's headed.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.015
Yeah, well, that's why
we need to find him.We will. Buck will be fine.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.539
One thing's for sure:we ain't gonna find Buck

06:05.582 --> 06:07.236
just standing around here,
so let's plan this out.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.412
All right, Chris and I
can go talk to Owen.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.109
Last two calls he
made were to him.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.676
Tan, I want you to check
and see if Buck stopped

06:12.720 --> 06:13.808
at any of his favorite haunts
around town.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.287
You know the places.Yeah.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.202
Street and I will try to find
Buck's ex-wife Jenny,

06:17.246 --> 06:18.639
see if he reached out to her.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.205
Luca, you sit on his housein case he comes home.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.859
All right, be careful.We think Buck is armed

06:21.903 --> 06:22.860
and he may be drinking.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.384
That's a scary combination.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.037
And keep your phones close.
Rocker and Becker's teams

06:26.081 --> 06:27.778
are up today,
but we're on call in case

06:27.822 --> 06:29.214
anything else
pops off in the city.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.477
Let's get it done.Okay.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.174
Got your voice mail.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.567
It sounded urgent.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.046
Did Buck stop
by here today?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.484
Yeah.
To resign from the company.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.007
When?A few hours ago.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.009
It was strange. He apologized.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.315
Said that he's been letting meand the company down,

06:43.359 --> 06:46.057
that he needed to resignand get out of our way.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.798
Yeah, his work has beenslipping, but I would've got him

06:47.842 --> 06:49.626
back on track, talked
him out of quitting.I tried.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.932
But he insisted.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.760
Did he say anything about
what he was doing

06:52.803 --> 06:54.109
or where he was going?

06:54.152 --> 06:55.153
No, nothing.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.328
Work aside,

06:56.372 --> 06:58.243
Buck's a friend.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.984
Is he okay?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.075
Hondo, Jim.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.294
Long time.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.643
HONDO: It's nice
to see you, Jenny.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.079
Did something happen to Buck?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.256
You say that likeit wouldn't be a surprise.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.910
Well, would it be?

07:12.954 --> 07:14.608
He's been drinking, a lot.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.131
Avoiding us,
not answering calls.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.786
How bad is it, honestly?

07:18.829 --> 07:21.092
Jenny, we're worried
that he might hurt himself.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.312
Have you seen him lately?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.618
Did he reach out at all?

07:24.661 --> 07:26.402
He stopped by
a couple of nights ago,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.578
but I wasn't home.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.145
He left me a vinyl record:

07:30.188 --> 07:32.234
"Got to Give It Up"
by Marvin Gaye.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.583
Whenever we heard that song,

07:33.627 --> 07:35.890
he'd pull me up
and we'd start dancing.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.239
Bars, restaurants,
down the middle

07:37.282 --> 07:39.023
of the ice cream aisle
at the store.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.810
That was a different Buck,
though, different times.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.507
He's just going through
a rough patch right now.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.030
[chuckles softly]

07:48.032 --> 07:50.034
You really don't know, do you?

07:52.384 --> 07:54.604
After Buck left SWAT,

07:54.648 --> 07:58.173
we tried to reconcile,
save our marriage.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.827
He'd always had his struggles,

07:59.870 --> 08:04.005
but it got worse after
the Raymont Harris shooting.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.659
Anxiety, depression,

08:05.702 --> 08:07.661
mood swings.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.097
Sometimes he couldn't
sleep at all

08:09.140 --> 08:11.099
unless he got blackout drunk.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.449
You've heard ofsleepwalking?

08:15.233 --> 08:19.455
Some nights, he'd tryto arrest me in his sleep.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.459
Accidentally bounced my head onthe nightstand a couple times.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.724
I couldn't stay around anymore.

08:29.204 --> 08:32.207
I tried to get him to talk
to somebody, get some help.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.035
But he was too worried about
how it would look,

08:34.078 --> 08:35.689

seeming weak.

either way.

the job right now

09:25.216 --> 09:27.175
and he won't be back
for quite some time.

here if you don't mind.

Oh, my 20-Squad's finished.
It's not me anymore.

Of course it is, Buck.
You're still one of us, man.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.521
No, no, Hondo,
I'm not one of you.

I'm not one of
you guys anymore.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.243
Everything just feels so...
just heavy.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.247
I can't even count
the nights that I just

33:08.290 --> 33:11.250
hope and I pray that the lightsup here would just go out,

33:11.293 --> 33:14.122
you know, just so that the painwould just go away.

I'm tired, man.
I'm sick of it.

I'm sick of hoping and
I'm sick of waiting for this.

I know you're in a lot of pain.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.059
And that's why you can't seehow losing you is gonna hurt us.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.800
You've been fine without me.

33:39.843 --> 33:41.236

if I'd be alive right now.

You think that's a conversationI want to have?

in person, over the phone,

42:44.910 --> 42:46.607
Connect them
to helpful resources,

42:46.651 --> 42:49.088

Suicide Prevention hotline.
