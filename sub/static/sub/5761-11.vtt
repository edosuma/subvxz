00:08.200 --> 00:10.500
My name is 
Melinda Gordon.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.700
I'm married,

00:11.800 --> 00:14.000
I live in a small town,

00:14.100 --> 00:15.900
and I own an antique shop.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.100
I might be just like you

00:18.200 --> 00:19.900
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.400
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.600
It's all right, honey.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:26.908 --> 00:29.500
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:29.603 --> 00:33.307
and they come to me for help.

00:34.706 --> 00:40.005
In order to te you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.706
I am frozen.

01:04.809 --> 01:07.902
I think it's gonna snow.

01:08.008 --> 01:09.703
How did we buy all this
in one trip?

01:09.807 --> 01:11.102
Whoo! Teamwork.

01:11.208 --> 01:12.900
I don't even remember
what we bought.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.003
Oh. I just hope you don't remember
what we spent.

01:15.105 --> 01:18.102
That I'm gonna remember
for the rest of my life.

01:18.205 --> 01:21.102
Oh, my gosh. I'm just glad
that it's over.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.502
Oh. Um, actually, it's not.

01:23.606 --> 01:25.201
The groceries are in the back.

01:25.308 --> 01:26.702
I knew that.

01:26.806 --> 01:27.600
You want my help?

01:27.707 --> 01:28.903
No, but I could use a drink.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.101
- Oh. Something hot?
- Uh, not for the cold.

01:31.207 --> 01:32.802
For the bills.

01:32.907 --> 01:35.302
Right.

02:21.806 --> 02:24.401
It's raining outside.
Can you believe this?

02:24.508 --> 02:27.502
Is this a mosquito?

02:27.605 --> 02:30.703
This time of year?

02:31.606 --> 02:32.801
Wow. All right.

02:32.905 --> 02:34.903
Global warming has come to Grandview at...

02:35.006 --> 02:37.501
9:53 P.M.

02:39.606 --> 02:41.803
You ok?

02:41.906 --> 02:47.003
I just feel hot all the sudden.
I'm gonna go change.

02:48.007 --> 02:51.403
Yeah. That's a mosquito.

04:42.406 --> 04:45.803
EPISODE 2x11
Cat's Claw

04:48.406 --> 04:51.100
All I did was walk into our room,
and all of the sudden,

04:51.205 --> 04:55.101
I was in the middle of a jungle
with vines and yellow flowers.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.201
It was raining, and there were
bugs crawling all over my feet.

04:58.305 --> 04:59.803
I mean, it was awful.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.102
Maybe it was something you ate.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.701
We were at the same restaurant.

05:02.806 --> 05:04.503
Yes, but did not have
the spicy egg roll.

05:04.607 --> 05:09.203
Yeah. It was not the egg roll,
and I know a ghost when I see one.

05:09.307 --> 05:11.702
Or a ghost's hands
when I see one.

05:11.805 --> 05:13.703
Have a little ice cream,

05:13.807 --> 05:15.201
help cool you down.

05:15.306 --> 05:17.801
What I want to know is
how a ghost from the jungle

05:17.906 --> 05:18.903
made it into our house.

05:19.007 --> 05:23.002
The closest I've been to a jungle is
the Central Park Zoo, and I was 10.

05:23.108 --> 05:24.702
Hey. Maybe you brought him
back from the mall.

05:24.806 --> 05:28.300
Well, it doesn't matter now
that he knows where I live.

05:28.406 --> 05:30.602
I just hope he's done with me
for the night.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.503
Yeah. Me, too.

05:33.907 --> 05:37.203
Man, it's coming down.

05:37.906 --> 05:40.102
Jim.

05:50.505 --> 05:51.602
Morning!

05:51.708 --> 05:52.203
Good morning!

05:52.307 --> 05:53.901
Hey. I think I struck gold,

05:54.005 --> 05:56.801
but I'm gonna need some help
carrying everything in, ok?

05:56.907 --> 05:59.903
I have a friend who just bought a house
out of probate about a month ago,

06:00.007 --> 06:03.203
and apparently, there was a little old
lady who lived in it her whole life,

06:03.308 --> 06:05.602
so she got everything
in the house, as well.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.403
I guess there was a whole bunch
of great stuff in the attic,

06:08.507 --> 06:09.803
and she knew we worked together,

06:09.907 --> 06:13.603
and she wanted to know if we were
interested in consigning any of it,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.603
so I brought a few things down.

06:16.708 --> 06:19.303
This stuff is in amazingly good shape.

06:19.407 --> 06:21.101
I don't know what it is, but I like it.

06:21.207 --> 06:22.500
It's a sextant.

06:22.606 --> 06:24.500
No  kidding.
That's what they call that?

06:24.607 --> 06:26.501
I don't kid about sextants.

06:26.607 --> 06:28.403
Hey. I love this.

06:28.505 --> 06:31.601
See, that is definitely you.
You look great in that!

06:31.708 --> 06:34.803
Don't I have to be
a tap-dancer to wear this?

06:34.908 --> 06:37.900
Ohh! This is beautiful.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.603
This...

06:39.707 --> 06:42.701
is definitely me.

06:42.906 --> 06:45.000
She's mine.

06:45.107 --> 06:47.203
Take it off!

06:47.306 --> 06:48.803
Something wrong?

06:48.908 --> 06:52.002
- I thought I saw a spider on it.
- Oh, god! Really? Was it big?

06:52.108 --> 06:53.003
Big one.

06:53.107 --> 06:55.003
Oh. Well, ok.

06:55.107 --> 06:57.002
No more old hats for me.

06:57.108 --> 06:58.702
You know what?

06:58.808 --> 07:01.501
Um, I have a quick errand to run.
You good here?

07:01.605 --> 07:02.402
Yeah. Sure.

07:02.505 --> 07:08.302
I just want to get this dry-cleaned
before we put it on display.

07:08.508 --> 07:11.002
Oh, god!

07:11.207 --> 07:14.403
Ugh! I hate spiders.

07:25.107 --> 07:27.101
Damn it!

07:27.208 --> 07:29.400
Oh, damn it!

07:29.508 --> 07:32.000
Damn it!

07:32.408 --> 07:34.902
How long have you been standing there?
You know what? It doesn't matter.

07:35.005 --> 07:40.502
I don't have time. I have a meeting in
15 minutes, and I can't find my keys,
so make it snappy.

07:40.606 --> 07:43.101
I did not leave my keys there.

07:43.205 --> 07:45.300
Ok. Well, I've only got
15 minutes, so...

07:45.406 --> 07:49.400
No. I didn't leave my keys in the door.
I never leave my keys in the door.

07:49.508 --> 07:52.500
- This is--this is really strange.
- Everyone loses their keys.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.403
I'm not everyone, and I don't
leave my keys in the door.

07:54.506 --> 07:57.300
That's what I'm trying to explain
to you. This is... this...

07:57.408 --> 07:58.701
is that a cake?

07:58.808 --> 08:00.103
No.

08:00.207 --> 08:02.500
Recognize this?

08:02.606 --> 08:06.402
Oh, my god.

08:06.408 --> 08:08.103
What?

08:08.208 --> 08:10.203
It's a hat.

08:10.305 --> 08:12.401
It's a nice one, too.
I'd say 1940?

08:12.508 --> 08:13.501
How much do you want for it?

08:13.606 --> 08:15.301
That's not why I brought it.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.300
As if I didn't know.

08:16.407 --> 08:17.501
No!

08:17.608 --> 08:19.301
What are we afraid of?

08:19.407 --> 08:21.401
- I think it might be Romano's.
- Who's Romano?

08:21.507 --> 08:24.200
- The cult leader. The one that you...
- Oh, yeah. Him.

08:24.305 --> 08:26.203
You really thought
it belonged to him, huh?

08:26.308 --> 08:29.102
You brought this to me, so...

08:29.206 --> 08:31.402
So I could tell you if
it meant anything terrible?

08:31.508 --> 08:33.802
Well, aside from messing up my hair
and giving me headaches,

08:33.905 --> 08:35.501
- hats don't really mean much...
- What's this?

08:35.605 --> 08:39.503
Careful!
Don't knock that over.

08:40.806 --> 08:42.903
Congratulations, Melinda.
You just saved a life.

08:43.005 --> 08:44.400
- Excuse me?
- It's a manikin.

08:44.507 --> 08:47.503
It's used to treat sickness by 
a shaman, medicine man, witch doctor,

08:47.608 --> 08:48.900
whatever you want to call it.

08:49.008 --> 08:52.900
It's placed near a patient, and an
incantation is given by Mr Hocus Pocus.

08:53.008 --> 08:56.500
If this wooden figure is to remain
upright during said incantation,

08:56.607 --> 08:59.603
then the patient will live.
They'll recover, but if during

08:59.708 --> 09:03.102
said incantation this
were to fall down...

09:03.207 --> 09:08.103
that would mean impending death
or severe drunkenness.

09:08.205 --> 09:11.403
- I think I've seen this.
- Really? Where?

09:11.507 --> 09:13.801
A  museum, I think.
Where'd you get it?

09:13.908 --> 09:16.701
That was given to me by a member
of the Machiguenga tribe,

09:16.808 --> 09:19.401
which  I almost died getting it,
and that's a different story.

09:19.507 --> 09:22.501
Look. I have...
I have really got to go.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.402
I thought you said
that I had 15 minutes.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.403
You're on Payne time, baby.

09:26.507 --> 09:28.001
Professor Payne!

09:28.107 --> 09:29.600
I was 3 weeks in Peru.

09:29.706 --> 09:33.800
I was documenting native cultural
traditions for my beloved university.

09:33.903 --> 09:37.507
Religious, tribal, symbols,
belief systems, et cetera,

09:37.606 --> 09:40.205
and I came across this practice
called kanaima.

09:40.304 --> 09:45.706
It's the mutilation and killing of
enemies and then the consumption
of a rather awful concoction.

09:45.809 --> 09:48.302
Smells terrible, and it's made up
of putrefied human remains,

09:48.406 --> 09:51.903
which I accidentally almost ingested.
At least, I think it was accidental.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.802
I prefer to think that they were
trying to assassinate me.

09:53.906 --> 09:57.003
It makes for a much more
compelling story. Excuse me.

09:57.105 --> 09:58.701
- Can I just ask you...
- No. You know what?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.803
This I should really...

10:00.906 --> 10:03.700
do by myself.

10:59.805 --> 11:02.503
Are you ok?

11:03.208 --> 11:05.902
Are you ok?

11:12.405 --> 11:14.601
And then I turn around, and I am
back in the forest again,

11:14.708 --> 11:18.700
and this manikin falls
right on top of me.

11:18.807 --> 11:19.502
A mannequin.

11:19.607 --> 11:22.800
And not one of those James Perse
kind of mannequins in the window
at Neiman Marcus.

11:22.906 --> 11:27.102
I'm talking about the kind
of manikin that witch doctors
use to treat sick people.

11:27.205 --> 11:29.003
Did the ghost tell you that?

11:29.107 --> 11:32.203
No. Professor Payne,
anyway, all I know

11:32.308 --> 11:34.801
is that if it falls over
someone will die.

11:34.907 --> 11:36.801
- Seems like somebody already did.
- No. Not the ghost.

11:36.906 --> 11:38.001
Somebody's going to die.

11:38.108 --> 11:39.402
Hey. You know what
I can't figure?

11:39.507 --> 11:42.401
How is it that the ghost of someone
who died in the jungle

11:42.505 --> 11:43.702
ends up in Grandview?

11:43.808 --> 11:45.500
I mean, the jungle's not
exactly down the block.

11:45.607 --> 11:47.303
You know, maybe it was Payne.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.101
He said he was in Peru.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.002
Peru has jungle?

11:51.105 --> 11:56.003
Yeah. And he does have
the carving in his office.

11:56.105 --> 11:57.502
Maybe it's attached to Payne, huh?

11:57.607 --> 11:59.500
I mean, is that where you saw
the ghost, in Payne's office?

11:59.608 --> 12:01.903
No. Down the hall
near the men's restroom.

12:02.008 --> 12:04.303
The ghost is haunting the men's
restroom? That's disgusting.

12:04.408 --> 12:08.100
No. Payne was in the restroom,
and the ghost was behind me.

12:08.207 --> 12:12.101
Either the ghost followed you,
or it was on campus.

12:12.206 --> 12:13.302
You know, maybe he was student.

12:13.406 --> 12:15.900
Whatever happened to him,
it was really unpleasant.

12:16.008 --> 12:17.603
I mean, every time
he tries to talk,

12:17.706 --> 12:21.401
it's just all this blood just
running out of his mouth and...

12:21.507 --> 12:22.502
Hey.

12:22.606 --> 12:25.103
Oh. Sorry.

12:25.205 --> 12:27.600
Hey! This is where I was.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.002
Look!

12:31.508 --> 12:32.702
Definitely not Grandview.

12:32.805 --> 12:36.201
No. That is the plant.
That's the thing that the ghost
was holding that cut my hand.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.403
- Una de Gato?
- Yeah. Cat's Claw.

12:38.506 --> 12:40.301
It's from the rain forest in South America.

12:40.406 --> 12:44.102
"Being studied as a medicinal treatment
for dengue fever, yellow fever, and ebola."

12:44.207 --> 12:46.703
Wow! Those are really the big ones.

12:46.806 --> 12:49.402
You know what? If he caught one of these,
that explains the blood in the mouth.

12:49.505 --> 12:51.600
- They can cause internal hemorrhaging.
- Hey! Listen to this.

12:51.705 --> 12:55.803
"Dr. Penn Grogan, one of the experts
on tropical medicinal plant research

12:55.907 --> 13:00.302
brought back these specimens from
the Rockland university research
expedition last summer. "

13:00.407 --> 13:02.602
Bingo.

13:02.705 --> 13:10.401
You know, why do I have a really
sinking feeling I know where you're
gonna be tomorrow morning?

13:13.605 --> 13:18.702
And the liani is a semidomesticated
plant found in the western amazon basin.

13:18.808 --> 13:22.302
Scientific name -
banisteriopsis caapi malpighiaceae.

13:22.408 --> 13:26.300
Known locally in Quichua as ayahuasca,
or vine of the soul.

13:26.405 --> 13:31.002
This name is given to the plant
by the indigenous people because of
its effectiveness in healing wounds.

13:31.106 --> 13:34.403
We harvested several samples
in the urubamba river drainage.

13:34.506 --> 13:37.102
In this same area,
we took samples of kemishitsa,

13:37.206 --> 13:40.001
a very powerful hallucinogenic.

13:40.108 --> 13:42.202
The plant research we're doing
will help find treatments

13:42.306 --> 13:46.003
and hopefully cures for some of
humanity's most virulent diseases -

13:46.105 --> 13:52.501
marburg, lassa fever, ebola, yellow
fever, dengue fever, and the diseases.

13:54.508 --> 13:58.303
The hemorrhagic fevers that...

14:08.506 --> 14:13.100
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong.

14:19.607 --> 14:24.701
We'll have to continue this
another time. I'm sorry.

14:32.107 --> 14:34.100
Dr Grogan, please,
I need to talk to you.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.402
Not right now, please.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.903
- It will only take a few minutes.
- Not right now, please.

14:39.006 --> 14:41.700
Are you ok?

15:02.107 --> 15:03.901
You surprise me!

15:04.005 --> 15:06.000
I saw you in that lecture,
and I thought to myself,

15:06.107 --> 15:10.103
"what interest could she possibly
have in medicinal jungle plants?"

15:10.208 --> 15:11.600
I like flowers.

15:11.705 --> 15:13.402
Really?
Anything in particular?

15:13.507 --> 15:15.600
Una de Gato. What about you?
What flowers do you like?

15:15.708 --> 15:18.402
I don't. I was there for dr. Grogan.
She's a friend.

15:18.508 --> 15:19.200
Is she ok?

15:19.308 --> 15:21.500
Well, she's going through some
personal issues right now, getting

15:21.605 --> 15:24.200
a lot of pressure from the university.
It's very difficult being the top

15:24.305 --> 15:27.101
in one's field, as I very well know.

15:27.207 --> 15:29.003
I thought you said
this was about flowers.

15:29.108 --> 15:34.402
I just want to know
if someone died on that expedition.

15:34.508 --> 15:37.403
Martin Schaer was one of
our premier research scientists.

15:37.507 --> 15:40.403
Great writer.
He wrote a brilliant book.

15:40.508 --> 15:42.201
I have it here somewhere.
Let me tell you something.

15:42.306 --> 15:45.301
This guy had it all. He had
the charisma, the brains, the smarts.

15:45.406 --> 15:47.402
Great writer, brilliant professor.
I know what you're thinking.

15:47.508 --> 15:49.401
"Hey, that sounds a lot
like professor Rick Payne."

15:49.506 --> 15:52.102
But seriously, he was...
he was truly one of the greats.

15:52.207 --> 15:54.403
That's... that's Marty right there.

15:54.506 --> 15:56.301
He was a heck of a racquetball player, too.

15:56.407 --> 15:59.501
He beat me almost every week, and
I'm not easy to beat at racquetball.

15:59.607 --> 16:00.903
I'm good at racquetball.

16:01.005 --> 16:04.302
Even had a couple species of
jungle plants named after him.
Did you know that?

16:04.408 --> 16:05.603
You knew him well?

16:05.707 --> 16:06.400
Oh, yeah.

16:06.505 --> 16:08.103
Whenever he'd go on
one of his expeditions,

16:08.207 --> 16:10.500
he would always come back
with something for my collection,

16:10.606 --> 16:11.900
as you can see.

16:12.008 --> 16:15.500
He died on this expedition,
and not...

16:15.607 --> 16:16.903
not in a good way.

16:17.008 --> 16:19.101
Dr. Grogan was on
that same expedition.

16:19.206 --> 16:21.601
Made her famous. She got
all the accolades and awards,

16:21.708 --> 16:23.403
all the kudos
they could throw at her.

16:23.508 --> 16:24.803
A lot of people think
she didn't deserve it.

16:24.906 --> 16:28.601
It was actually Martin Schaer
who was the driving force
behind that expedition

16:28.706 --> 16:30.900
and  she was taking advantage of
his death because he was her mentor,

16:31.006 --> 16:33.203
but either way you look at it,
he's dead, she's not.

16:33.305 --> 16:35.703
She looks great in a pair of shorts, 
and she's got brains and talent,

16:35.808 --> 16:38.103
and when you look like she does
and you can go into the jungle

16:38.205 --> 16:40.803
and hang out with guys that
sharpen their teeth with files,

16:40.905 --> 16:42.703
you're gonna get a lot of attention.

16:42.808 --> 16:44.903
And whenever I see dr Grogan,
I think to myself,

16:45.005 --> 16:48.502
"Wow. Has she got a body or what?"

16:48.608 --> 16:51.303
Do you have to be this crass,
or can't you help it?

16:51.405 --> 16:55.900
I can help it. I usually do it
as a defense mechanism so I don't get
too emotionally attached to humanity.

16:56.005 --> 17:00.201
You might have to be
a different person with your wife.

17:00.308 --> 17:03.903
With  her, I don't have to be
so charming.

17:04.007 --> 17:06.502
Where's that book?
"Cat's Claw."

17:06.608 --> 17:10.301
It was right... here.
"Cat's claw" was the name of it.

17:10.407 --> 17:12.300
- Do you see it?
- Maybe somebody borrowed it.

17:12.507 --> 17:14.400
No, if they borrowed it,
I would know. It's my book.

17:14.508 --> 17:17.000
I would know if it was... borrowed.

17:17.105 --> 17:20.401
- Can I buy a copy?
- Yeah, at the university bookstore.

17:20.505 --> 17:21.803
- Sorry.
- Ok.

17:21.905 --> 17:24.101
Wait. Why are so you so interested
in this all of a sudden?

17:24.208 --> 17:25.300
Why... what's going on?

17:25.405 --> 17:27.400
Do you think Grogan had something
to do with Marty's death?

17:27.507 --> 17:28.301
I don't know yet.

17:28.407 --> 17:30.601
Well, why were you at the lecture?
What were you gonna ask Grogan?

17:30.706 --> 17:32.103
I need to read the book first.

17:32.205 --> 17:34.803
You're talking in circles.
You know I know you're not being
straight with me, right?

17:34.906 --> 17:36.300
- How would I know that?
- You're doing it again!

17:36.405 --> 17:38.201
You don't think I know a circle-talker
when I meet one?

17:38.305 --> 17:40.102
I don't think you'd find
my ideas very interesting.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.103
Hey, don't prejudge. Just because
I'm rude, snide, and sarcastic

17:43.208 --> 17:44.702
doesn't mean I don't have
a sensitive side.

17:44.806 --> 17:49.302
If you do see something strange,
call me.

18:00.506 --> 18:03.400
Son of a bitch.

18:06.805 --> 18:09.703
Where were you?

18:29.407 --> 18:31.903
Damn it!

18:46.206 --> 18:49.302
All right. Come on!

19:16.207 --> 19:18.603
You cannot believe the things
this guy has done.

19:18.706 --> 19:21.203
I mean, the places he's been,
just looking for plants.

19:21.307 --> 19:22.101
Get this:

19:22.208 --> 19:26.203
He was held for 10 days by drug dealers
in the rainforest of Venezuela.

19:26.308 --> 19:28.003
The guy's Indiana Jones.

19:28.106 --> 19:29.300
You know?

19:29.408 --> 19:31.000
He's the guy every guy wants to be.

19:31.105 --> 19:32.303
And he's dead.

19:32.408 --> 19:34.800
Well, yeah, except for that part.

19:34.905 --> 19:38.403
He got his ph. D. when he was 22,
then he spent the next 13 years

19:38.506 --> 19:41.603
teaching at the university and going on
expeditions for months at a time

19:41.705 --> 19:43.401
looking for cures to disease.

19:43.505 --> 19:47.000
He was leading a university-sponsored
research expedition in a remote section

19:47.105 --> 19:51.101
of the peruvian jungle Yomuibato?

19:51.305 --> 19:53.500
And that's where he died.

19:53.606 --> 19:55.101
Sad.

19:55.208 --> 19:56.901
He had a real passion for what he did.

19:57.007 --> 19:58.001
Yeah.

19:58.106 --> 20:00.202
Anyway, I think he's got
an issue with dr. Grogan.

20:00.308 --> 20:01.902
Ever since she got back
from the expedition,

20:02.005 --> 20:04.501
she's been getting the credit
for all their discoveries.

20:04.607 --> 20:07.103
Hey, does Grogan know
that she's with ghost?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.602
Well, I think she knows
that something's wrong.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.501
I just don't think
she knows it's him.

20:10.608 --> 20:13.300
I guess somebody's got to tell her.

20:13.405 --> 20:14.203
You?

20:14.305 --> 20:17.803
No. This is me going to work,
although I could call her.

20:17.907 --> 20:20.201
And say, "dr. Grogan, you know
you've got a ghost attached to you,"

20:20.307 --> 20:21.701
and then hang up real quickly.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.503
That's a great idea.
Maybe I'll try that.

20:24.605 --> 20:26.300
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

20:26.405 --> 20:27.800
I'll try not to wake you up.

20:27.906 --> 20:30.502
Please do.

20:30.708 --> 20:34.301
I like to know you're back.

20:37.607 --> 20:40.300
Ok, Martin.

21:10.805 --> 21:13.800
Honey! I'm home!

21:50.907 --> 21:53.502
Who is it?

22:04.705 --> 22:06.001
You saw me!

22:06.106 --> 22:08.102
You saw me!
There's no denying you saw me!

22:08.208 --> 22:11.903
Now open up!
We need to talk!

22:13.206 --> 22:15.000
- Hi.
- You've been drinking.

22:15.106 --> 22:17.403
- Statement or question?
- What do you want?

22:17.505 --> 22:19.601
What do I want?
Good.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.700
I'll tell you what I want.

22:22.805 --> 22:24.703
I want to know...

22:24.808 --> 22:27.403
I want to know what it is that you do.

22:27.505 --> 22:28.800
You shouldn't be doing this.

22:28.907 --> 22:32.803
The world is filled with people
doing things they shouldn't be doing.

22:32.908 --> 22:35.200
Having sex with other people's wives, 

22:35.307 --> 22:37.900
cheating on their taxes,

22:38.005 --> 22:41.303
running red lights...

22:41.806 --> 22:44.101
Iraq.

22:44.305 --> 22:46.202
What's your deal, lady?

22:46.307 --> 22:51.202
What is going on? You come to me with
this Romano character and his hat,

22:51.307 --> 22:55.601
and then you start drawing me pictures.
Not very good pictures, I might add

22:55.705 --> 22:58.601
and the next thing you know,
things are going bump in the night,

22:58.705 --> 23:01.801
and  I'm not a bump-in-the-night
type of guy.

23:01.907 --> 23:03.201
I don't get it.

23:03.305 --> 23:07.601
You draw me symbols, numbers, music...

23:10.806 --> 23:12.602
How long have you lived here?

23:12.706 --> 23:14.201
Almost two years.

23:14.408 --> 23:17.200
That's good. That was a test.
You passed.

23:17.306 --> 23:21.601
Get the easy question out of the way
before I ask the hard one.

23:21.707 --> 23:23.003
Good for you.

23:23.105 --> 23:25.502
I guess your husband's not home,

23:25.607 --> 23:30.000
because if he was, I'd probably
be pulling his fist out of my face
right about now.

23:30.107 --> 23:32.901
You might get to do that
at a later date.

23:33.007 --> 23:35.300
Well, that's the really good thing
about being too drunk,

23:35.406 --> 23:38.401
because you have a false sense
of invulnerability.

23:38.505 --> 23:40.502
Yeah, well, eventually,
it wears off.

23:40.606 --> 23:43.400
So let's get started.

23:43.507 --> 23:46.103
This isn't about a book
you guys are writing.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.901
You're not writing a book,
Melinda Gordon.

23:48.008 --> 23:49.303
You're not writing a book.

23:49.408 --> 23:52.502
You got something inside of you.

23:52.607 --> 23:55.602
Something special inside of you.

23:55.705 --> 23:59.701
That store that you got down there,
that's not what you're about.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.800
No.

24:01.907 --> 24:05.600
That's a front
for what's inside of you.

24:05.706 --> 24:10.803
And I don't know, you could say it is
or not true, and it won't matter to me

24:10.907 --> 24:12.303
because I know it's true.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.503
Ok. Well, if you know it's true,
then why don't you go home?

24:14.605 --> 24:17.100
Because I don't even know
what I know anymore.

24:17.206 --> 24:21.402
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

24:21.505 --> 24:25.400
That's why I'm here,
trying to make sense of something.

24:25.507 --> 24:29.702
I'm trying to make sense of anything.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.600
Why are you interested in jungle plants?

24:36.706 --> 24:38.700
No, forget that.
I don't care about jungle plants,

24:38.806 --> 24:41.703
and I don't think you care
about jungle plants, either.

24:41.805 --> 24:44.301
Suddenly you want to know
about my kanaima manikin

24:44.408 --> 24:47.803
and how does dr. Grogan

24:48.405 --> 24:49.902
figure into all this?

24:50.006 --> 24:52.201
Yeah, I really don't want to talk
to you when you're like this.

24:52.306 --> 24:56.702
I may be drunk, Melinda Gordon,
but at least...

24:56.808 --> 24:59.702
I'm telling the truth.

24:59.808 --> 25:02.900
I'm gonna cut to the chase, ok?

25:03.007 --> 25:04.302
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

25:04.406 --> 25:07.601
I don't think there's enough
give and take between you and I
in this relationship.

25:07.706 --> 25:12.901
So I think we'd better cut it off
before it gets too serious.

25:13.007 --> 25:15.300
Yeah. I said that.

25:15.407 --> 25:16.703
Besides, whatever it is you're doing,

25:16.808 --> 25:20.303
I'm sure it's probably
just smoke and mirrors.

25:20.407 --> 25:25.001
Next, you'll just pull
a rabbit out of your hat.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.700
Full circle.

25:26.807 --> 25:29.603
Back to the hat.

25:29.705 --> 25:32.901
I never really looked good in hats.

25:33.005 --> 25:35.702
But with your hat, there's
a very interesting question,

25:35.807 --> 25:38.301
and that's whether or not will
the rabbit be dead or alive.

25:38.405 --> 25:40.000
I should call you a cab.

25:40.108 --> 25:42.600
Now, that's a good idea!

25:42.708 --> 25:44.800
Call the professor a cab.

25:44.905 --> 25:46.902
Ah, too bad I won't be in it.

25:47.006 --> 25:49.903
I will see you again...

25:50.007 --> 25:52.400
never.

25:56.905 --> 26:00.100
Damn it!

26:00.108 --> 26:02.101
What is wrong with you?

26:02.206 --> 26:05.500
I can't find my keys.

26:05.806 --> 26:07.002
You got my keys!

26:07.106 --> 26:09.703
You took them when you grabbed my arm,
and you took my keys.

26:09.806 --> 26:12.901
Now give them back.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.301
Please go to Grogan now.

26:18.805 --> 26:21.900
Are you all right?

26:22.006 --> 26:24.302
What the hell just happened?

26:24.408 --> 26:26.200
Where does dr. Grogan live?

26:26.307 --> 26:30.602
- What?
- Do you know where she lives?

26:38.506 --> 26:40.600
Why are we going to dr. Grogan's house?

26:40.708 --> 26:42.201
We'll find out when we get there.

26:42.305 --> 26:44.601
If you think something's wrong,
tell me.

26:44.708 --> 26:46.001
You told me.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.201
Look at the blood.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.401
I should get to a hospital, I think.

26:52.505 --> 26:55.301
It's not yours.

26:55.407 --> 27:00.202
Why does that not make me
feel one bit better?

27:03.808 --> 27:07.002
Maybe she's not home.

27:07.105 --> 27:09.400
Something's going on in this house.

27:09.505 --> 27:12.500
Are you serious?

27:17.806 --> 27:21.303
She's inside.
Break down the door.

27:21.405 --> 27:23.302
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yes!

27:23.405 --> 27:24.601
Fine.

27:24.705 --> 27:27.301
No, no, no, no, no, no!
I'll do it.

27:27.408 --> 27:31.603
Come on. I'll do it.
Back up, please.

27:43.207 --> 27:44.502
I killed him.

27:44.607 --> 27:46.803
Oh, my god.

27:46.906 --> 27:48.801
I killed martin.

27:48.905 --> 27:51.702
I killed him.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.503
Call 911!

27:58.107 --> 28:00.601
It's ok.

28:02.507 --> 28:04.502
We just tried to keep her walking
until you got here.

28:04.607 --> 28:08.402
Well, you did the right thing.

28:08.707 --> 28:11.401
Did Payne have something
to do with this? Or her?

28:11.505 --> 28:15.200
No. It was an anonymous tip.

28:16.508 --> 28:19.503
Fill me in later.

28:20.105 --> 28:22.302
Hey, I could really use a ride home.

28:22.408 --> 28:23.602
Your car's at my house.

28:23.706 --> 28:28.000
Well, it's not going anywhere.
No keys.

28:41.007 --> 28:42.900
That was an interesting evening, huh?

28:43.008 --> 28:45.300
Yeah.

28:45.508 --> 28:47.801
So...

28:49.406 --> 28:51.603
look, if I ask, will you tell me?

28:51.706 --> 28:52.602
How I knew?

28:52.708 --> 28:56.503
Among other things I can't blame on
my overindulgence in alcohol, yes.

28:56.607 --> 28:59.000
I just wish I knew what
your reaction was gonna be.

28:59.105 --> 29:05.103
It'll probably be a high level
of incredulity, but I'll try
to keep it within reason.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.801
If I'm gonna say it,
I'm gonna need you to promise

29:07.905 --> 29:10.600
because it's not something
I want everyone to know.

29:10.706 --> 29:13.302
I... I won't tell anyone.
Do you want the cross-my-heart routine?

29:13.407 --> 29:14.502
You got it.

29:14.605 --> 29:18.100
No. A simple promise will be good.

29:18.208 --> 29:24.602
I promise you, Melinda,
whatever you tell me in this car
doesn't leave this car ever.

29:24.707 --> 29:28.203
I can speak to and see...

29:30.508 --> 29:31.902
Is this fill in the blank?

29:32.008 --> 29:33.602
The dead.

29:33.708 --> 29:34.803
You don't mean the grateful, do you?

29:34.907 --> 29:38.002
That's how I knew that
dr. Grogan was in trouble.

29:38.107 --> 29:41.801
Martin Schaer. He used you
to tell me to get to her.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.102
It's his spirit that you felt.
That's why you had blood your mouth.

29:44.207 --> 29:47.902
Because he did when he died.

29:48.705 --> 29:51.901
Now you know. Happy?

29:52.906 --> 29:55.403
I don't if "happy" is the right word.

29:55.508 --> 29:57.103
Does this happen a lot?

29:57.208 --> 30:00.001
It's not something
I want to go into right now.

30:00.107 --> 30:05.301
Look, you can believe me or not,
and if you can find another way
to explain what happened tonight,

30:05.408 --> 30:08.302
it's ok with me.

30:08.405 --> 30:11.500
I wish you could hear the argument
I'm having with myself in my head
right now.

30:11.605 --> 30:14.801
Is that why you came to my house?

30:14.908 --> 30:15.701
Yes.

30:15.805 --> 30:17.902
Was it necessary to be drunk?

30:18.005 --> 30:25.202
Yes, because I didn't decide
to come to your house until after
I had started drinking.

30:28.405 --> 30:31.701
I want to go home now.

31:21.007 --> 31:23.202
Oh... no.

31:23.307 --> 31:25.902
Not again.

31:28.908 --> 31:31.700
This is where I found it.

31:31.806 --> 31:35.702
I had to be part of a ceremony
with the Machiguenga.

31:35.806 --> 31:41.201
A ritual, so they would take me
to a place they considered sacred.

31:41.307 --> 31:43.402
I wanted to find the plant
that they told me about.

31:43.508 --> 31:44.901
Una de gato,

31:45.005 --> 31:46.500
The cat's claw.

31:46.606 --> 31:52.501
The Machiguenga were very protective.
They'd only take two of us.

31:53.808 --> 31:55.402
Where have you been?

31:55.506 --> 31:59.100
With my new best friends,
the Machiguenga.

31:59.207 --> 32:04.302
- Can those guys party or what?
- Will they take us?

32:05.808 --> 32:08.700
- Yes, but just two.
- Is that a good idea?

32:08.805 --> 32:10.803
It's their jungle, their rules.
I'd go by myself if that's what they...

32:10.906 --> 32:14.302
Ok, ok. So you and who?

32:15.806 --> 32:18.600
Gee, I wonder.

32:23.805 --> 32:25.702
What have you been drinking?

32:25.808 --> 32:27.202
I'm really not sure.

32:27.305 --> 32:28.201
You don't know what you drank?

32:28.305 --> 32:33.501
It was a machiguenga cerenial concoction.
I had to drink it to seal the deal.

32:33.606 --> 32:37.102
I have no idea what was in it, but I'm
positive it wouldn't get FDA approval.

32:37.207 --> 32:41.703
It tasted just you know, pine tar
and a little hint of bat urine.

32:41.805 --> 32:43.302
Oh, that's nice. That's romantic.

32:43.406 --> 32:44.900
Actually, it was.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.900
I had...

32:47.008 --> 32:52.603
I had the most incredible visions,
all of them involving you.

32:52.706 --> 32:56.800
And they swore to me
that it would increase sexual...

32:56.908 --> 32:59.201
Ok, ok, ok. Fine, fine.

32:59.307 --> 33:02.302
So when do we go?

33:03.106 --> 33:05.501
3 hours.

33:05.608 --> 33:08.601
And apparently it's quite a hike.

33:08.705 --> 33:12.503
- Is that ok with you?
- Yeah.

33:13.807 --> 33:15.903
You're a little hot.
Do you feel ok?

33:16.006 --> 33:20.102
Oh, yeah. If I'm hot,
it's just because I'm here with you.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.600
- I'm telling you, those visions...
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

33:22.705 --> 33:27.702
- I think you've got a fever.
- What? Oh. I mean, come on.

33:27.806 --> 33:28.800
A little temperature?

33:28.907 --> 33:30.400
That's not gonna keep me
from going there,

33:30.505 --> 33:33.403
especially after drinking what
I had to drink to make it happen.

33:33.507 --> 33:36.503
If the Machiguenga think that I'm a wimp,
it's gonna blow the whole deal.

33:36.606 --> 33:37.801
Come on. We go.

33:37.905 --> 33:38.701
We're going.

33:38.808 --> 33:42.100
We go no matter what.

33:42.806 --> 33:46.501
Hey, I'll take two aspirins,
and call you in the morning.

33:46.605 --> 33:49.003
All right? If I can find a phone
that works in the Yomuibato.

33:49.108 --> 33:51.403
Call.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.903
Sorry!

34:24.806 --> 34:26.000
How's dr. Grogan?

34:26.105 --> 34:28.000
We got in there just in time.

34:28.108 --> 34:32.701
They pumped her stomach immediately,
but they still don't know what she took.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.502
You saved her life, you know.

34:35.608 --> 34:38.601
You know, people get awards from
the mayor for doing that sort of thing.

34:38.706 --> 34:42.501
I'd have to share mine with a ghost.
He told me.

34:42.606 --> 34:46.801
Tell me, what was
Payne doing there?

34:47.405 --> 34:49.800
I told him.

34:49.906 --> 34:51.400
Wow.

34:51.507 --> 34:55.703
I think my ghosts are starting
to invade his life.

34:55.806 --> 34:56.702
Did he say that?

34:56.808 --> 34:59.001
No, not exactly.

34:59.106 --> 35:01.302
But he knows
that things are happening,

35:01.408 --> 35:06.800
and I couldn't come up with
a rational explanation, so...

35:07.208 --> 35:09.403
I run out of lies sometimes.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.802
Hey, they're not lies.

35:11.908 --> 35:16.802
I mean, whatever you think,
but they're not lies.

35:18.407 --> 35:22.602
He probably didn't believe me anyway.

35:23.308 --> 35:26.300
- Now you're here, I can sleep.
- That's right.

35:26.406 --> 35:28.803
Well...

35:31.205 --> 35:34.100
Melinda Gordon?

35:34.908 --> 35:37.600
Wow. I mean, yeah.

35:37.705 --> 35:40.803
Sorry to just show up like this.

35:40.905 --> 35:43.401
Rick came to see me in the hospital.

35:43.508 --> 35:46.600
Uh, sorry.
Professor Payne.

35:46.707 --> 35:49.100
He told me how you found me.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.800
He did?

35:50.908 --> 35:53.203
Yeah.

35:53.905 --> 35:57.500
He said you saved my life.

35:58.006 --> 35:58.903
Yeah.

35:59.005 --> 36:02.600
Um, do you want to come in?

36:07.606 --> 36:11.500
Uh, Rick said he was with you...

36:13.108 --> 36:16.703
That you knew I was in trouble?

36:16.808 --> 36:20.402
And he said you knew things
about Martin Schaer.

36:20.507 --> 36:23.201
He said he couldn't tell me
what you knew, just...

36:23.308 --> 36:26.302
I had to ask you.

36:27.605 --> 36:29.902
Did... did you know Martin?

36:30.008 --> 36:31.702
I know him, yes.

36:31.807 --> 36:35.303
You were with him when he died.

36:35.406 --> 36:38.400
It was my fault.

36:40.407 --> 36:43.601
I knew he was sick.
I should have kept him from going.

36:43.708 --> 36:47.301
Do you think you could have?

36:47.405 --> 36:50.701
You don't understand.

36:51.906 --> 36:54.602
I left him.

36:55.308 --> 36:58.001
I left him.

37:01.405 --> 37:03.202
The guards were moving too fast.

37:03.307 --> 37:04.802
I can't see where they went.

37:04.905 --> 37:08.002
Marty, I see some.

37:08.308 --> 37:10.803
It's right here.
We found it.

37:10.906 --> 37:12.900
Marty, are you ok?

37:13.008 --> 37:14.401
Marty.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.101
Uh! Ok. Marty.

37:16.208 --> 37:17.102
Come on.

37:17.207 --> 37:18.700
We can't stop here.

37:18.807 --> 37:20.302
Wait. Wait.

37:20.406 --> 37:23.303
No. No.
We're going back.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.600
Ok.

37:25.708 --> 37:28.502
Penn, it's ok. I'm ok.
It's ok. I just--

37:28.607 --> 37:29.800
We have to go back.

37:29.907 --> 37:33.702
- This is the only time we can do this.
- No. No. We have to go back.

37:33.806 --> 37:36.800
Will you hold...

37:38.806 --> 37:41.200
I want you to go.

37:41.307 --> 37:43.001
Go back the way we came.

37:43.107 --> 37:46.001
I'll wait here.

37:49.706 --> 37:53.000
I love you.

37:53.007 --> 37:56.901
I'll be here when you get back.

37:57.408 --> 37:59.602
Ok.

37:59.906 --> 38:02.402
I'll go back. I'll bring help.

38:02.506 --> 38:04.400
I'll promise.

38:04.505 --> 38:06.001
I went back to camp as fast as I could,

38:06.105 --> 38:11.100
but he wasn't where I'd left him
when we got back.

38:11.705 --> 38:15.603
We looked for him for two days.

38:19.908 --> 38:24.803
We were supposed to get married
when we got back.

38:25.507 --> 38:27.900
When I got back, I...

38:28.007 --> 38:29.901
I was so empty inside,

38:30.007 --> 38:31.302
all I could do was work.

38:31.408 --> 38:36.202
I couldn't stop to think. If I did,
I would think of him, and...

38:36.306 --> 38:42.501
and then I was getting all the credit
for things that we did together.

38:42.905 --> 38:47.502
I couldn't have done
any of it without him.

38:47.905 --> 38:50.403
And the university
insisted it was ok.

38:50.506 --> 38:55.002
The more famous the professor,
the more grant money for the university.

38:55.105 --> 38:59.502
He was sick for 3 days
before you left him.

38:59.606 --> 39:02.602
How do you know that?

39:02.707 --> 39:04.403
I've seen Martin.

39:04.505 --> 39:07.202
His spirit.

39:07.308 --> 39:09.800
He's here with us right now.

39:09.905 --> 39:11.100
I...

39:11.208 --> 39:13.402
I don't believe you.

39:13.506 --> 39:15.402
I didn't want to believe I was sick.

39:15.508 --> 39:18.803
There was so much work we had to do,
and there wasn't enough time to do it.

39:18.906 --> 39:22.303
He didn't want to say anything
about being sick because

39:22.405 --> 39:24.101
there was so much work
you had to do.

39:24.206 --> 39:26.801
And now she blames herself for
what happened, but there's nothing

39:26.905 --> 39:30.600
that could have saved me. It was
dengue fever. Mosquitoes carry it.

39:30.708 --> 39:33.003
He knows that you blame yourself,

39:33.107 --> 39:34.801
but he was already dying.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.601
He had dengue fever.

39:36.705 --> 39:43.400
I tried to make it back on my own,
but I wasn't thinking right,
and I got lost.

39:51.707 --> 39:54.903
I couldn't find her.

39:56.108 --> 39:59.501
When I finally couldn't walk anymore,
I just...

39:59.607 --> 40:02.703
I lay down to die.

40:03.605 --> 40:06.200
But I thought that...

40:06.307 --> 40:09.702
no matter what happened,

40:10.108 --> 40:13.501
I would always love her.

40:14.608 --> 40:18.301
He was thinking of you
when he died.

40:18.407 --> 40:22.703
He knew that he would
always love you.

40:24.207 --> 40:27.602
I'm so lost without you.

40:28.905 --> 40:30.800
Everywhere I go,

40:30.908 --> 40:32.803
everywhere I look,

40:32.908 --> 40:35.303
I can feel you.

40:35.406 --> 40:37.501
Us.

40:37.607 --> 40:41.101
You showed me everything.

40:41.508 --> 40:42.903
And now I don't want...

40:43.005 --> 40:47.203
I don't want to be here
without you.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.102
Please don't leave me.

40:51.207 --> 40:52.300
We were meant to be together.

40:52.407 --> 40:55.903
We were meant to show each other
the things we did, to teach each other,

40:56.005 --> 40:58.600
and now it's...
it's meant to be different.

40:58.707 --> 41:01.801
But nothing...
nothing can take it away.

41:01.905 --> 41:07.200
We'll both bring all of it
with us wherever we go next.

41:07.906 --> 41:10.500
I'll tell her.

41:10.606 --> 41:12.603
Tell her to keep working.

41:12.705 --> 41:14.300
But tell her she's got to
keep living, too,

41:14.408 --> 41:18.800
because one's no good
without the other.

41:20.705 --> 41:22.503
It's gonna be hard for him.

41:22.607 --> 41:23.802
Who?

41:23.906 --> 41:26.000
Rick Payne.

41:26.106 --> 41:29.401
It's gonna be hard for him
to stay so cynical now.

41:29.506 --> 41:32.500
He'll find a way.

41:42.907 --> 41:46.602
What is it?
What's happening?

41:47.805 --> 41:50.000
He's crossed over.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.703
He's gone.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.002
That's a good thing, right?

41:59.107 --> 42:02.500
Yeah, it's a good thing.

42:03.406 --> 42:04.401
Come on.

42:04.508 --> 42:09.203
Let's take a walk,
and we can talk some more.

42:37.507 --> 42:39.302
I had to come back and get my car.

42:39.406 --> 42:42.302
Find your keys?

42:44.206 --> 42:47.401
Martin crossed over.

42:48.707 --> 42:50.001
- He told me...
- Hold on.

42:50.106 --> 42:56.702
I need a moment to keep my knee-jerk
cynical reaction from ignoring
all other possibilities.

42:56.807 --> 42:58.801
Ok.

42:58.905 --> 43:00.202
Martin told you...

43:00.307 --> 43:03.201
That he was worried about you.

43:03.308 --> 43:06.902
He doesn't know how you're going to
be able to stay so cynical now.

43:07.007 --> 43:08.503
I'll find a way.

43:08.605 --> 43:11.101
Exactly.

43:14.807 --> 43:18.302
I think I might have been partially
inebriated the other night.

43:18.408 --> 43:19.602
Partially.

43:19.705 --> 43:24.702
Partially, which I probably
owe you an apology for,

43:24.806 --> 43:28.403
which will come
in the very near future.

43:28.507 --> 43:31.002
No rush.

43:41.606 --> 43:45.801
