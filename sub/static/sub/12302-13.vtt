WEBVTT

00:23.534 --> 00:24.696
What'd this guy do wrong ?

00:24.939 --> 00:25.676
It's what he didn't do.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.038
He's got expired tags.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.145
What do you do if
they don't pull over ?

00:30.941 --> 00:31.905
You call for backup,

00:31.906 --> 00:33.493
but that rarely ever happens.

00:34.525 --> 00:36.652
Don't take this wrong, but
I hope it happens today.

00:37.305 --> 00:40.049
You civilian ride-alongs
are all alike.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.288
You know, uh...

00:53.328 --> 00:54.459
maybe I could back you up.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.723
What does your waiver say ?

01:03.225 --> 01:04.382
"I understand that I may not

01:04.384 --> 01:05.940
exit the vehicle at any time."

01:06.693 --> 01:08.461
When you get out of the Academy,

01:08.832 --> 01:09.924
you can get out of the car.

01:22.056 --> 01:23.569
Turn off your music.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.230
License and registration,
please.

01:34.634 --> 01:36.227
Yeah, I'd like to call in a...

01:43.302 --> 01:44.085
Oh, no.

02:05.335 --> 02:06.448
Who is he, Frank ?

02:06.466 --> 02:07.690
Officer Rich Insko.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.080
Ten years on patrol.

02:09.452 --> 02:10.508
Wife and two kids.

02:11.584 --> 02:12.845
Call in the traffic stop ?

02:12.921 --> 02:14.259
No, he punched in the MDT

02:14.259 --> 02:16.136
at 0520, routine stop.

02:16.477 --> 02:18.078
Or so it would seem.

02:18.335 --> 02:18.817
Alexx ?

02:19.557 --> 02:21.160
At least two shots fired.

02:21.654 --> 02:23.097
One to the vest,

02:23.484 --> 02:24.426
one to the head.

02:24.562 --> 02:25.815
I'll post him right away.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.494
Let's expedite the notification.

02:27.494 --> 02:30.047
I don't want his family hearing
about it on the news.

02:30.113 --> 02:31.310
Frank, am I crazy,

02:31.311 --> 02:33.135
or do I see two coffee
cups in there ?

02:33.136 --> 02:34.079
Did he have a partner ?

02:34.259 --> 02:34.794
Worse.

02:36.081 --> 02:37.657
Found this outside the radio car.

02:37.952 --> 02:39.328
Double-checked the in-service log.

02:39.395 --> 02:41.645
"Patrick Brookner."
He had a ride-along ?

02:41.739 --> 02:43.246
Glorified baby-sitting service.

02:43.251 --> 02:45.628
You ask me, civilians
shouldn't be in a patrol car.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.762
Frank, where is Patrick now?

02:47.940 --> 02:49.600
Well, I don't know.
He's missing from the scene.

02:49.601 --> 02:50.655
Maybe he took off.

02:50.744 --> 02:52.094
Or maybe...

02:52.835 --> 02:54.467
he got taken for a ride.

03:52.914 --> 03:53.563
Hey, Ryan.

03:53.619 --> 03:53.953
Hey.

03:54.173 --> 03:55.619
Thanks for coming in
on your day off.

03:55.637 --> 03:56.681
It's the least I could do.

03:56.686 --> 03:58.226
I figured it was gonna
be all hands on deck.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.647
Did you know him, Officer Insko?

04:01.699 --> 04:02.601
I knew of him.

04:04.001 --> 04:04.784
He was a good cop.

04:06.458 --> 04:07.454
So what do we got here?

04:08.108 --> 04:10.045
Body position relative
to these treadmarks

04:10.045 --> 04:11.302
indicate that he may have been

04:11.303 --> 04:12.712
speaking to the driver of the car.

04:12.775 --> 04:15.774
There were no casings recovered,
which suggests that a revolver

04:15.775 --> 04:16.692
might have been used,

04:16.694 --> 04:18.091
or he was shot from inside the car.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.493
Did Insko get a shot off?

04:20.012 --> 04:21.406
No, his service pistol was missing.

04:23.439 --> 04:25.605
Kill a cop in cold blood
and steal his gun.

04:26.127 --> 04:27.507
That takes some stones.

04:28.196 --> 04:29.396
Killer may have done us a favor.

04:29.396 --> 04:30.756
That might be a partial shoeprint.

04:34.344 --> 04:36.625
It's a hell of a way
to beat a traffic ticket.

04:40.130 --> 04:41.243
Hey, guys, we got lucky.

04:41.584 --> 04:43.913
Officer Insko entered
the suspect vehicle's

04:43.914 --> 04:45.226
tag numbers into his MDT

04:45.226 --> 04:46.080
when he pulled over.

04:46.238 --> 04:48.148
It's a black Toyota Land Cruiser.

04:48.457 --> 04:52.278
License number EX3 940.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.521
Okay, so we're looking
for a black SUV.

04:55.091 --> 04:56.372
Not necessarily.

04:57.027 --> 04:58.533
This wheelbase doesn't
match the description.

04:58.533 --> 04:59.623
It's too short.

05:00.029 --> 05:01.548
There was a sedan parked here.

05:01.548 --> 05:02.758
The car was cold-plated?

05:02.927 --> 05:06.057
Yeah, steal a car, steal
plates from another car...

05:15.162 --> 05:17.411
...switch 'em, makes it
a lot harder to ID the car.

05:18.699 --> 05:20.173
100.8 inches.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.120
I'm going to check
the NICB database

05:22.125 --> 05:23.987
and see if we can match it
to our killer's car.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.126
Let's do it.

06:20.122 --> 06:21.599
There's an awful lot
of blood, Alexx.

06:21.599 --> 06:22.736
Did his vest fail?

06:22.822 --> 06:23.390
No.

06:23.895 --> 06:25.829
Blood must have come
from the head wound.

06:26.411 --> 06:28.108
Kevlar lining caught the bullet.

06:32.169 --> 06:33.154
Alexx,

06:33.367 --> 06:34.803
looks like it's
caught something else.

06:34.803 --> 06:35.765
What is that?

06:39.980 --> 06:41.580
White plastic.

06:42.391 --> 06:45.288
Some kind of green shape
printed on it.

06:45.358 --> 06:46.712
Alexx, that is the shape

06:46.712 --> 06:49.229
of Florida, and it's
from a driver's license.

06:49.271 --> 06:50.980
How'd it get inside
the bullet hole?

06:51.027 --> 06:53.135
Normally on patrol, an officer

06:53.135 --> 06:55.537
will clip a license
to his uniform pocket.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.494
Means it could
belong to the shooter.

07:05.573 --> 07:07.304
Let's get that to QD,
all right, Alexx?

07:08.319 --> 07:08.995
excuse me.

07:11.226 --> 07:11.642
Yeah?

07:12.001 --> 07:14.125
We got a make and model
on the car from the T-stop.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.345
Wheelbase is a match
to a Mitsubishi Eclipse.

07:16.345 --> 07:18.416
Mitsubishi with stolen tags.

07:18.424 --> 07:20.400
I'm going to put out a
broadcast: armed and dangerous.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.253
Yes, low-profile, please.

07:22.295 --> 07:22.952
How low?

07:23.104 --> 07:24.680
Ground level.

07:25.005 --> 07:26.268
Spike strips.

07:48.438 --> 07:49.161
Thank you.

07:54.214 --> 07:56.300
Patrol spotted the car
on the freeway.

07:56.485 --> 07:58.085
Managed to divert it over here.

07:58.247 --> 07:59.151
We get the driver?

07:59.753 --> 08:00.472
Oh, yeah.

08:05.224 --> 08:06.475
What's wrong with this picture?

08:06.869 --> 08:08.051
Missy Marshall.

08:08.456 --> 08:10.816
16 years old,
St. Lucita's High School.

08:10.861 --> 08:12.196
Any sign of the ride-along?

08:12.366 --> 08:13.833
Negative; she was driving alone.

08:13.833 --> 08:14.699
in the car.

08:15.159 --> 08:16.643
I think he was inside
at some point.

08:17.046 --> 08:17.818
Based on...?

08:18.007 --> 08:20.049
Strong odor of ammonia
from the back seat.

08:20.939 --> 08:22.208
He may have relieved himself.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.751
He must've been terrified.

08:27.272 --> 08:28.716
Ryan, why don't you
wrap and tow the car,

08:28.716 --> 08:30.187
and we'll see what else
we can get off of it.

08:30.254 --> 08:31.213
Okay, you got it.

08:31.317 --> 08:33.330
So, what are we going to do
with the high school girl?

08:34.878 --> 08:36.101
Give her detention.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.139
I didn't do anything wrong.

08:44.380 --> 08:45.622
You were driving a car used

08:45.622 --> 08:48.037
in an officer-involved
shooting, Missy.

08:48.321 --> 08:49.781
Why did you run from the police?

08:51.478 --> 08:52.664
I was scared.

08:53.234 --> 08:54.551
I didn't want to get in trouble.

08:54.943 --> 08:56.830
See, the correct answer
was, "What shooting?"

08:58.411 --> 08:59.691
A police officer is dead,

08:59.691 --> 09:01.916
and the boy who was
with him is missing.

09:02.930 --> 09:04.236
I didn't shoot him.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.339
Who did?

09:09.530 --> 09:11.032
His name is Jojo.

09:11.347 --> 09:13.016
Jojo what?

09:14.054 --> 09:14.889
I don't know.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.755
I met him this morning
at Surfside Mall.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.787
He said he wanted
to take me for a ride.

09:20.043 --> 09:21.107
And you went with him?

09:22.627 --> 09:24.435
He was cute,
and he had a cool car.

09:24.551 --> 09:25.609
A stolen car,

09:26.143 --> 09:27.092
that you were driving.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.599
I didn't know it was stolen.

09:29.613 --> 09:32.139
He sent me out to get donuts
and a pack of cigarettes.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.324
Missy, why didn't you go
to the police?

09:34.846 --> 09:35.903
I wanted to,

09:36.579 --> 09:38.893
but he said if I wasn't back
in 20 minutes...

09:39.880 --> 09:41.920
he'd kill the guy from the police car.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.072
Tell us exactly where
the three of you were staying.

09:46.556 --> 09:47.320
I don't remember.

09:48.209 --> 09:49.705
I was only supposed to go
a couple blocks,

09:49.705 --> 09:52.166
and then I got lost when
the cops started chasing me.

09:54.723 --> 09:55.554
I'm sorry.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.770
I'm really sorry.

10:04.763 --> 10:05.765
I'll handle this.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.701
Ms. Nevins.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.290
We're in the middle of an interrogation.

10:16.603 --> 10:17.363
I can see that.

10:17.532 --> 10:20.373
You're questioning a minor without
a parent or an attorney present.

10:20.683 --> 10:22.343
We're still trying to reach her mother.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.998
You can't talk to her alone.
She's a 16-year-old.

10:25.512 --> 10:28.475
Who may know the location
of a 17-year-old hostage.

10:28.532 --> 10:29.728
Well, it's my duty to warn you

10:29.728 --> 10:32.728
anything she says in there
may not be admissible in court.

10:33.297 --> 10:34.269
Right, I understand,

10:34.284 --> 10:35.886
but I think right now,
the most important thing

10:35.886 --> 10:37.121
is to find that boy.

10:37.774 --> 10:38.849
Wouldn't you agree?

10:39.217 --> 10:41.567
Not if it means undermining
this entire case.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.186
I have ethical problems
with this type of behavior.

10:47.092 --> 10:48.695
Are you questioning my conduct?

10:49.318 --> 10:50.964
Maybe it needs to be questioned.

10:55.964 --> 10:57.328
This is my case.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.791
I don't need you to tell me
how to run it.

11:00.178 --> 11:03.323
Yours for now, but it's going
to be mine later.

11:05.835 --> 11:08.550
Seems like there's a lot of
that going around these days.

11:39.969 --> 11:40.692
Yeah. This is Wolfe.

11:40.859 --> 11:43.696
What'd you get from the car?
Any usable prints?

11:44.252 --> 11:46.607
Couple of smudged partials.
Nothing worthy of AFIS.

11:46.641 --> 11:47.605
What about the driver?

11:47.671 --> 11:49.807
It's definitely not our girl.
Prints are too large.

11:49.852 --> 11:51.602
They're, uh, possibly a male.

11:51.721 --> 11:53.768
Okay, you find the killer,
you find the ride-along.

11:53.768 --> 11:54.782
So, go back to the car.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.880
I've been through it,
Lieutenant, inside and out.

11:57.776 --> 11:58.701
There's nothing.

11:58.796 --> 12:01.027
Mr. Wolfe, go back to the car.

12:05.887 --> 12:06.471
Yes, sir.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.264
Thought you might want to see this.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.547
Which case is this, Frank?

12:09.601 --> 12:10.459
It's your case.

12:10.558 --> 12:12.153
Officer Insko's nine-mil.

12:12.873 --> 12:13.802
Where'd you get it, Frank?

12:13.810 --> 12:15.576
We found it on a carjacking suspect

12:15.579 --> 12:16.921
about an hour ago in Uleta.

12:17.185 --> 12:18.187
Matched the serial number.

12:18.218 --> 12:19.014
Where'd he get it?

12:19.164 --> 12:20.836
Says it fell out of the sky.

12:20.836 --> 12:22.129
Oh, don't they all?

12:25.396 --> 12:26.249
Jake,

12:26.509 --> 12:29.087
a patrol officer was
killed this morning,

12:29.307 --> 12:30.893
and you were carrying his gun.

12:30.977 --> 12:33.013
I told you guys.
I found that gun.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.098
Lift up your right foot.

12:37.896 --> 12:38.845
Lift it up.

12:41.570 --> 12:44.453
In my business,
that's called blood, Jake.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.475
Why don't you give us that shoe?

12:46.921 --> 12:48.241
I-I don't know how that got there.

12:48.411 --> 12:49.931
I don't want you to worry about that.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.607
I'm gonna figure it out.

12:52.525 --> 12:53.569
Get his shoe.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.730
How long do I have to wait?

12:58.679 --> 12:59.507
I have no idea.

13:00.664 --> 13:02.340
Do I get to call a lawyer?

13:03.392 --> 13:03.902
It's all right--

13:03.902 --> 13:05.810
he can't see you through the glass.

13:09.494 --> 13:12.105
Yeah, that's him. That's Jojo.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.428
I thought he was a nice guy.

13:14.428 --> 13:15.843
God, I'm such an idiot.

13:16.531 --> 13:17.824
Well, you're still alive.

13:17.954 --> 13:19.625
Patrick Brookner might not be.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.166
I just want to go home and forget
any of this ever happened.

13:23.298 --> 13:25.131
You see, the problem, Missy, is that

13:25.140 --> 13:27.319
you're a material witness
in a police shooting

13:27.319 --> 13:28.329
and a kidnapping.

13:29.522 --> 13:31.768
But you got the bad guy, right?
What do you need me for?

13:31.768 --> 13:33.566
Because we are still
looking for a hostage.

13:34.185 --> 13:35.674
So you're gonna be here for a while.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.499
We've contacted your mother.
She's on her way here.

13:38.645 --> 13:40.751
In the meantime,
you can wait with an officer.

13:45.349 --> 13:46.592
Lucky girl.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.611
If you believe her story.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.266
You don't?

13:49.559 --> 13:52.791
Witnesses are notoriously unreliable.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.999
Officer Insko's nine-millimeter?

14:18.035 --> 14:19.411
We can rule it out.
It doesn't match

14:19.411 --> 14:21.726
either of the rounds
recovered from Insko's body.

14:21.889 --> 14:23.848
It also doesn't match
the schoolgirl's story.

14:23.879 --> 14:24.997
Okay, I'm listening.

14:25.499 --> 14:28.177
DNA found blood on the grip,
right side only.

14:28.205 --> 14:29.490
No surprise there.

14:29.714 --> 14:30.604
But look at the pattern.

14:30.604 --> 14:34.494
It's consistent with the gun
being holstered, like this.

14:35.195 --> 14:36.798
He never drew his weapon, did he?

14:36.798 --> 14:38.595
More importantly, it would
have taken the blood

14:38.595 --> 14:40.991
two to three minutes to flow
from his head wound to the grip.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.202
And the killer would not
have waited around for that.

14:50.453 --> 14:51.896
Carjacker's story is true.

14:51.896 --> 14:53.512
He stole the gun off Insko's body.

15:03.969 --> 15:07.009
So, our schoolgirl lied about
him being the shooter, didn't she?

15:07.184 --> 15:08.450
Why would she do that?

15:08.841 --> 15:11.810
I don't know, but the last place
she was with him was in that car.

16:10.942 --> 16:12.041
Hotel's a hotel.

16:12.076 --> 16:13.106
High turnover.

16:13.141 --> 16:15.143
I can't remember every
car that comes through.

16:15.178 --> 16:16.941
Any guests recently named Jojo?

16:17.190 --> 16:18.484
Uh, not that I recall.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.348
Okay. What about this girl?

16:20.383 --> 16:22.142
Oh, yeah, her I remember.

16:22.170 --> 16:24.013
She's with that boyfriend all the time.

16:24.465 --> 16:25.522
All the time?

16:25.744 --> 16:27.090
Last two months anyway.

16:27.131 --> 16:29.764
Missy told Calleigh she
met Jojo this morning.

16:29.799 --> 16:31.199
Could you describe the boyfriend?

16:31.695 --> 16:33.256
Oh, yeah, I can do better than that.

16:33.456 --> 16:35.706
See, if they haven't got a
credit card, I take a picture.

16:36.172 --> 16:38.534
Keeps those snowbirds
and deadbeat musicians

16:38.569 --> 16:40.068
from, uh, running out on the bill.

16:41.559 --> 16:43.029
I'm gonna need to see the room.

16:44.060 --> 16:44.932
Okay.

16:55.993 --> 16:57.123
Lingerie.

16:59.053 --> 17:00.015
Makeup.

17:01.405 --> 17:03.550
Looks like our Catholic
schoolgirl had a dark side.

17:03.585 --> 17:05.680
Yes, and getting darker by the...

17:06.867 --> 17:08.083
moment.

17:12.142 --> 17:14.351
These are bank security bags.

17:15.029 --> 17:17.406
All from local convenience stores.

17:18.223 --> 17:20.396
We got a real-life Bonnie
and Clyde on our hands.

17:20.432 --> 17:25.262
Yes, and our schoolgirl just
went from liar to accomplice.

17:25.463 --> 17:26.586
I don't understand.

17:26.621 --> 17:28.059
Missy's on the Honor Roll.

17:28.094 --> 17:30.467
She was the Junior Homecoming Queen.

17:30.502 --> 17:33.830
She's not the kind of girl that
gets into this kind of trouble.

17:33.865 --> 17:36.277
I'm afraid Missy's
troubles are just beginning.

17:38.646 --> 17:39.613
What is that?

17:39.648 --> 17:42.313
Evidence of a series of
mini-mart robberies committed

17:42.314 --> 17:44.979
over the last two months
by a male and a female.

17:45.527 --> 17:48.325
We believe that this
is the male suspect.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.546
John Johnson, aka Jojo.

17:50.581 --> 17:52.053
And the female is your daughter.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.390
Missy, what's going on?

17:56.425 --> 17:57.274
Who is that man?

17:59.282 --> 18:01.745
He told me if I loved
him, I would help him.

18:01.780 --> 18:02.740
Oh, my God.

18:02.775 --> 18:05.141
He said he needed money. He
promised me no one would get hurt.

18:05.176 --> 18:08.856
A police officer was killed, and you
implicated another man in the crime.

18:08.891 --> 18:10.454
I didn't want them to arrest Jojo.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.017
Missy, don't say another word.

18:12.052 --> 18:12.979
But I love him...

18:13.014 --> 18:13.906
Not another word.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.008
Look, I know how you people work.

18:16.043 --> 18:17.402
I run my own PR firm.

18:17.437 --> 18:21.058
My daughter is a minor, and she was
under the influence of a dangerous felon.

18:21.093 --> 18:23.395
Your daughter is an
accessory at the very least.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.159
Well, she was clearly
protecting this man.

18:25.194 --> 18:26.854
He's the one that you
should be arresting.

18:26.889 --> 18:30.432
Well, my hope is when we do, their
17-year-old hostage is still alive.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.286
Everything from the last two months.

18:40.754 --> 18:44.923
Five unsolved convenience store
robberies, all matching your suspect's MO.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.756
Thanks, Paula.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.628
Mm-hmm.

18:48.545 --> 18:54.072
So how does a Junior Homecoming Queen end
up robbing mini-marts with a guy like Jojo?

18:54.883 --> 18:55.732
Well,

18:56.668 --> 18:59.275
some women are just
attracted to bad boys.

19:00.088 --> 19:01.156
Oh, really?

19:01.191 --> 19:02.080
Do tell.

19:02.115 --> 19:02.934
Oh, come on.

19:02.969 --> 19:04.433
Like you've never been tempted.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.161
They're dangerous and unpredictable.

19:10.337 --> 19:12.510
Maybe not so unpredictable.

19:12.545 --> 19:15.470
Jojo's got no home and no car, right?

19:15.505 --> 19:17.462
He's eventually gonna need money.

19:17.497 --> 19:19.419
Where are you going with this?

19:20.291 --> 19:22.476
When he wants cash, he
doesn't go to the ATM.

19:22.836 --> 19:24.563
You think he's gonna
rob another mini-mart?

19:25.592 --> 19:28.130
Criminals are creatures of
habit. There could be a pattern.

19:28.330 --> 19:31.085
The targets were five mini-marts,

19:32.102 --> 19:34.518
all in the same ten-mile stretch

19:35.429 --> 19:37.468
off the West Dixie Highway.

19:40.837 --> 19:43.714
They only hit places with
counters low enough to jump over,

19:43.749 --> 19:47.580
And nowhere with bullet-resistant
acrylic to shield the cashier.

19:47.615 --> 19:51.411
He wants as little resistance as
possible between him and the cash.

19:53.496 --> 19:54.864
An easy getaway.

19:54.899 --> 19:56.275
Attached parking lots.

19:56.310 --> 19:58.261
Locations near highway on-ramps.

20:01.727 --> 20:03.442
Only leaves two targets.

20:03.642 --> 20:05.450
Let's call homicide.

20:09.944 --> 20:10.834
Freeze!

20:11.191 --> 20:12.208
Ryan, check him out.

20:20.743 --> 20:24.359
Yeah, I need an ambulance,
Handy Mini-mart, 320 Reef Drive.

20:24.394 --> 20:25.306
Horatio?

20:28.125 --> 20:29.247
What have you got, Frank?

20:38.257 --> 20:39.475
You're Patrick Brookner.

20:40.058 --> 20:41.096
How do you know my name?

20:42.900 --> 20:45.277
You were Officer Insko's
ride-along, aren't you, son?

20:45.312 --> 20:46.396
Place is all clear.

20:46.431 --> 20:47.165
Nobody else here.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.127
He-He ran out when the...
when the alarm went off.

20:49.162 --> 20:50.630
How long ago was that, Patrick?

20:50.665 --> 20:51.693
Eight minutes exactly.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.089
I looked at my watch
when you guys got here.

20:53.124 --> 20:53.880
That's very astute.

20:53.915 --> 20:56.681
Time is key when you're determining
the location of a suspect on the run.

20:56.716 --> 20:57.393
Yes, it is.

20:57.428 --> 20:58.154
How are you feeling?

20:58.189 --> 20:59.757
You want to go to the
hospital and get checked out?

20:59.792 --> 21:02.381
Uh, I think, I'm... I think I'm okay.

21:02.416 --> 21:03.771
Here's what we're gonna do, Patrick.

21:03.806 --> 21:04.429
Here you go.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.227
There we go.

21:06.027 --> 21:07.629
I'm gonna send you
downtown with an officer,

21:07.664 --> 21:09.077
and get your statement,
all right, Patrick?

21:09.112 --> 21:09.786
Anything I can do to help.

21:09.821 --> 21:11.089
No, that's perfect. Go ahead.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.153
I've seen that look before.

21:18.188 --> 21:18.662
Yeah.

21:18.697 --> 21:19.376
Something not right?

21:19.411 --> 21:21.291
Jojo almost beats the cashier to death,

21:21.326 --> 21:23.222
and Patrick walks out on his own steam.

21:24.001 --> 21:25.743
Maybe the kid bonded with his captor.

21:25.778 --> 21:26.840
You're thinking Stockholm?

21:27.034 --> 21:30.091
I am thinking he's not
telling us the truth.

21:41.845 --> 21:43.855
Is that the surveillance
video from the mini-mart?

21:43.890 --> 21:45.565
Yeah, that's all the usable stuff.

21:46.516 --> 21:48.211
That doesn't give us much to go on.

21:48.246 --> 21:50.242
We don't even know where Jojo went.

21:50.277 --> 21:52.242
Hey, I just cut it together.

21:53.273 --> 21:54.577
I don't see Patrick.

21:54.612 --> 21:57.074
The cameras don't cover
the refrigerated section.

21:58.710 --> 21:59.855
Okay, play it again.

22:01.958 --> 22:03.111
Wait. Right there.

22:04.028 --> 22:05.550
Isolate the counter in front of him

22:05.585 --> 22:06.829
rock it back and forth.

22:09.262 --> 22:11.215
Jojo took something off the counter.

22:11.823 --> 22:13.292
Can you clean up the "before" image?

22:13.627 --> 22:15.350
It's going to be grainy.

22:17.132 --> 22:18.205
Dramamine.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.455
That's motion sickness pills.

22:20.490 --> 22:24.380
The Handy Mini-Mart's six blocks
away from Bay Vista Marina.

22:24.415 --> 22:26.048
Then that's where I'll be.

22:29.963 --> 22:33.277
Hey, are you done with the duct
tape from our ride-along's wrists?

22:33.312 --> 22:34.468
Just about.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.483
Not finding any prints, though.

22:36.515 --> 22:39.172
If you don't get any prints,
maybe I can match a tool mark.

22:39.404 --> 22:40.740
You know, I don't think so.

22:40.778 --> 22:42.709
This tape has a jagged edge.

22:43.133 --> 22:44.534
Oh, it's ripped, not cut?

22:44.569 --> 22:45.387
Hold on a second.

22:45.422 --> 22:46.525
I think I got something.

22:46.760 --> 22:47.862
Is it a tool mark?

22:47.897 --> 22:48.821
No.

22:48.856 --> 22:51.017
No, tooth marks.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.737
See the incisal surface here?

22:54.772 --> 22:56.093
Someone chewed on this tape.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.814
Well, that makes sense.

22:57.849 --> 22:58.820
Patrick was taped up.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.047
Maybe he was trying to escape.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.828
Well, then how do you explain this?

23:07.627 --> 23:09.575
The tape roll collected at the scene.

23:10.164 --> 23:11.855
It seems to have similar bite marks.

23:12.558 --> 23:13.979
Well, that does not make sense.

23:14.312 --> 23:16.028
There's no reason for
him to bite the roll.

23:17.950 --> 23:19.398
Unless he taped himself up.

23:26.866 --> 23:28.059
But why would he do that?

23:28.578 --> 23:29.438
I don't know.

23:29.473 --> 23:31.662
One way to find out.

23:32.307 --> 23:33.389
How's the investigation going?

23:33.424 --> 23:34.485
You guys arrest a suspect?

23:34.520 --> 23:38.328
Patrick, in a case like this, it's
important that we have all the information.

23:38.935 --> 23:40.792
I gave my statement to the officer.

23:40.827 --> 23:41.887
I was very thorough.

23:41.922 --> 23:44.189
Yeah, but you left out
the best part, Patrick:

23:44.722 --> 23:47.267
the part where you tied
yourself up in the mini-mart.

23:47.855 --> 23:48.726
What?

23:49.568 --> 23:50.127
See that?

23:50.162 --> 23:51.350
Those are teeth marks,

23:51.385 --> 23:54.517
and I'll be willing to bet
that they match your teeth.

23:56.123 --> 23:58.180
Now, you lied in a police investigation.

23:58.215 --> 23:59.482
But I gave my statement.

23:59.517 --> 24:01.657
You gave your statement, but
you didn't tell the truth,

24:01.692 --> 24:03.968
so let's go, from the beginning.

24:06.349 --> 24:07.815
I've always wanted to be a cop.

24:08.186 --> 24:09.932
That's why I went on the ride-along.

24:11.815 --> 24:14.535
I- I always thought that I
could handle that situation,

24:15.459 --> 24:17.715
that split second under fire...

24:26.741 --> 24:28.031
Get out of the car now!

24:32.709 --> 24:33.484
I couldn't.

24:33.519 --> 24:34.047
I couldn't move.

24:34.082 --> 24:34.923
I couldn't do anything.

24:34.958 --> 24:35.519
I froze up.

24:35.554 --> 24:38.910
Why did you tape yourself
up in the mini-mart?

24:38.945 --> 24:41.351
I... Everything happened so fast, I...

24:42.355 --> 24:43.972
They dragged me in there at gunpoint.

24:44.007 --> 24:44.726
Stay there!

24:48.163 --> 24:49.639
I thought he was going to kill me, too.

24:58.839 --> 25:00.646
You're not even worth the bullet.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.146
I panicked.

25:17.786 --> 25:19.444
I thought that if I told the real truth

25:19.479 --> 25:21.302
that I wouldn't get into the Academy,

25:21.337 --> 25:23.262
and the only thing that I've
ever wanted to be was a cop.

25:23.297 --> 25:25.316
Being a cop is about telling the truth.

25:25.628 --> 25:27.254
Patrick, where is Jojo?

25:29.502 --> 25:31.124
I- I-I
don't know.

25:31.159 --> 25:33.595
Um, he said that he needed the money,

25:33.630 --> 25:35.936
uh, from the store to get out of town.

25:35.971 --> 25:36.701
Where was he heading?

25:38.706 --> 25:41.929
He was talking to someone on the
phone, someone named Mr. Fortune.

25:43.479 --> 25:44.655
Mr. Fortune?

25:44.961 --> 25:46.209
Eric, where is Ryan?

25:46.244 --> 25:48.615
He's at the Bay Vista
Marina looking for a boat.

25:48.650 --> 25:49.835
We just found the boat.

26:09.077 --> 26:10.454
Johnny Johnson?

26:10.718 --> 26:12.403
Or should I say "Jojo?"

26:12.799 --> 26:14.153
Depends who's asking.

26:14.188 --> 26:14.855
Come on, Jojo.

26:14.890 --> 26:15.633
You're a good guesser.

26:15.668 --> 26:16.801
Come to shore, please.

26:18.379 --> 26:20.245
That a boy.

26:23.570 --> 26:26.059
It's a little late to be going
out on the water today, isn't it?

26:26.094 --> 26:28.039
Last time I checked, it
wasn't against the law.

26:28.074 --> 26:30.978
I believe that's the first
legal move you've made today.

26:31.013 --> 26:33.042
I got no idea what you're talking about.

26:33.077 --> 26:35.300
Let's start with the
murder of a police officer,

26:35.335 --> 26:37.113
kidnapping, armed robbery.

26:37.148 --> 26:38.105
That's just for starters.

26:38.326 --> 26:40.391
I think one dead cop's enough for today.

26:40.426 --> 26:41.661
Day's still young.

26:41.696 --> 26:43.315
Anything's possible.

26:43.350 --> 26:44.651
Not for you, my friend.

26:45.368 --> 26:46.390
What'd you get?

26:47.036 --> 26:48.838
There's a hole in your driver's license.

26:50.097 --> 26:51.299
I don't know how that happened.

26:51.334 --> 26:51.916
I do,

26:51.951 --> 26:55.235
and it puts you at the scene
of Officer Insko's murder.

26:59.657 --> 27:00.867
Yeah, I'd like to call in...

27:14.454 --> 27:15.462
I didn't shoot him.

27:16.339 --> 27:17.085
Ask the girl.

27:17.120 --> 27:17.671
She'll tell you.

27:17.706 --> 27:19.797
The young lady says
you pulled the trigger.

27:21.018 --> 27:22.347
I'd like to see you prove that.

27:33.364 --> 27:34.542
What happened to your face?

27:35.030 --> 27:36.177
Why don't you tell me?

27:36.212 --> 27:38.304
I'm going to do that. Officer.

27:41.381 --> 27:42.719
Specks embedded in the skin.

27:42.754 --> 27:44.077
It's not much to give Trace.

27:44.112 --> 27:46.776
Forget about Trace and have
Calleigh run that weapon.

27:46.811 --> 27:48.930
We already know the killer
shot from close range.

27:49.358 --> 27:50.461
Let's make sure.

28:53.883 --> 28:56.477
Detergex dissolved the blood
on Officer Insko's shirt,

28:56.512 --> 28:58.062
leaving a GSR pattern.

28:58.733 --> 29:01.935
According to my distance
determination, it's about three feet.

29:01.970 --> 29:05.180
And Jojo was driving, so
he would've been too close.

29:05.215 --> 29:06.972
He couldn't have fired
the murder weapon.

29:07.007 --> 29:09.419
That only leaves one candidate.

29:14.054 --> 29:15.846
You killed Officer Insko, Missy.

29:15.881 --> 29:16.654
That's impossible.

29:16.689 --> 29:17.855
Actually, it's not.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.793
He was shot from three feet away,

29:19.828 --> 29:21.873
which is about the
distance from the passenger

29:21.874 --> 29:23.919
seat to the driver-side
window in an Eclipse.

29:27.139 --> 29:29.013
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

29:29.048 --> 29:30.883
License and registration, please.

29:32.609 --> 29:33.851
Do you know why I pulled you over?

29:33.886 --> 29:34.511
No, I don't.

29:34.546 --> 29:35.702
Your tags are expired.

29:35.737 --> 29:36.637
Can I see your license?

29:42.491 --> 29:43.612
Yeah, I'd like to call in...

29:47.897 --> 29:50.890
But you aimed a little too close to
your boyfriend's face, didn't you?

29:50.925 --> 29:52.134
He had unburned powder.

29:52.169 --> 29:54.510
That couldn't have happened if
he had fired the shot himself.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.777
It's not like I planned this.

30:03.529 --> 30:05.257
You killed a police officer.

30:06.619 --> 30:08.064
If the cop found out my age,

30:08.099 --> 30:09.509
it would've ruined everything.

30:10.121 --> 30:11.992
I wouldn't be able to see Jojo anymore.

30:15.844 --> 30:17.696
Well, I suggest you get used to that.

30:23.654 --> 30:25.306
What's going to happen to me, Mommy?

30:25.491 --> 30:27.691
It's going to be okay,
honey. Don't worry.

30:27.973 --> 30:29.348
We'll figure this out.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.602
I won't give up on her.

30:48.491 --> 30:49.736
Good. You shouldn't.

30:49.928 --> 30:51.409
She needs it, desperately.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.693
That man took advantage of my daughter.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.182
He should pay for that.

30:55.514 --> 30:57.060
She pulled the trigger, not him.

30:57.251 --> 30:59.623
He ruined her life! This is his fault!

31:00.270 --> 31:01.537
With all due respect, ma'am,

31:01.586 --> 31:02.509
that's just PR.

31:02.557 --> 31:03.067
Yeah,

31:03.446 --> 31:04.893
well, the world runs on it.

31:05.491 --> 31:06.529
So do trials.

31:22.495 --> 31:23.004
Ma'am.

31:23.253 --> 31:23.988
Sir.

31:24.557 --> 31:26.596
Heard we got the girl for
Officer Insko's murder.

31:26.773 --> 31:27.852
Yeah, we did.

31:28.196 --> 31:29.167
How'd you do with the boyfriend?

31:29.226 --> 31:29.842
Jojo?

31:30.059 --> 31:31.790
Great
- he agreed to testify.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.030
We made him a deal; he made bail.

31:34.753 --> 31:35.559
You made him a...?

31:36.590 --> 31:38.593
Rebecca, he's an accessory to murder.

31:38.782 --> 31:40.641
Which is why he'll be
a convincing witness

31:40.642 --> 31:41.674
at the girl's trial.

31:44.545 --> 31:46.470
Okay, we provided you
with the evidence...

31:47.238 --> 31:49.740
Still, the case against
Missy is circumstantial.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.449
The jury might not buy...

31:50.484 --> 31:52.417
Rebecca, why don't we
let them decide that?

31:52.418 --> 31:53.306
Don't you think?

31:54.264 --> 31:56.768
I think we need Mr. Johnson's testimony.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.766
Okay. You just made a
deal with a cop killer.

32:04.305 --> 32:05.386
I don't like to lose.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.223
I understand that, but if...

32:07.682 --> 32:11.075
Rebecca, if you do this, it's
going to ruin your career.

32:11.709 --> 32:12.910
Careers are long.

32:14.672 --> 32:15.221
Horatio.

32:15.280 --> 32:15.695
Yeah.

32:16.287 --> 32:18.539
Got a call-out.
Shooting in Miami Shores.

32:18.696 --> 32:20.089
You might recognize the address.

32:20.282 --> 32:21.808
As a matter of fact, I do.

32:24.089 --> 32:25.818
You might want to rethink that deal.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.817
Jojo posted bail two hours ago,

32:38.818 --> 32:40.077
and he's being gunned down already?

32:40.255 --> 32:42.327
You know, it's not for
lack of motive, is it?

32:42.704 --> 32:43.086
Yeah.

32:43.911 --> 32:45.647
He was very good at making enemies.

32:46.069 --> 32:46.958
Yes.

32:47.064 --> 32:49.160
The question becomes which one of them

32:50.127 --> 32:51.455
got to him first?

33:00.656 --> 33:02.100
You got biologicals?

33:02.452 --> 33:04.341
Yeah, doesn't look like skin.

33:04.364 --> 33:05.964
Maybe some kind of trace.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.339
Yeah, I'll take it to the lab.

33:08.722 --> 33:10.298
Kind of feels like
someone did us a favor

33:10.299 --> 33:12.324
with this one, though
- cop killer.

33:12.499 --> 33:13.406
Hey, now...

33:13.595 --> 33:14.950
Saves the county some money.

33:15.635 --> 33:17.492
Well, it doesn't matter who he was.

33:18.060 --> 33:18.962
He's a victim now.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.760
We have to treat it like any other case.

33:22.951 --> 33:24.231
How do you do that?

33:26.128 --> 33:28.961
I remind myself that this
was a person who was murdered,

33:29.128 --> 33:31.554
and I just want to get
another killer off the streets.

33:36.947 --> 33:39.609
This sliding glass
door has a busted lock.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.692
Easy access.

33:44.632 --> 33:45.366
But if you have a gun,

33:45.367 --> 33:46.780
why not just knock and shoot?

33:48.668 --> 33:50.429
Well, maybe the killer got here first

33:50.436 --> 33:51.938
and decided to surprise him.

33:52.096 --> 33:52.658
Yeah.

33:53.719 --> 33:55.032
Took his time about it.

33:55.596 --> 33:57.128
Jojo was in this room for a while

33:57.136 --> 33:58.395
before he got shot.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.937
So, what was the shooter
doing the entire time?

34:06.189 --> 34:08.745
Probably standing somewhere
where he wouldn't be noticed.

34:09.411 --> 34:10.652
Like the closet.

34:15.876 --> 34:17.241
Waiting for the right moment.

34:23.596 --> 34:25.614
Or gathering his nerve.

34:32.781 --> 34:33.916
Positive for lead.

34:34.212 --> 34:35.904
A bullet definitely did this.

34:36.009 --> 34:36.927
It's ricochet?

34:37.110 --> 34:37.708
No,

34:37.792 --> 34:39.150
that would have an elongated groove.

34:39.152 --> 34:40.449
This one's too round.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.108
I'm thinking accidental discharge.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.568
The shooter fired
directly into the floor.

34:51.761 --> 34:53.110
That explains the jacket frag

34:53.112 --> 34:54.297
all over the place.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.236
Bullet hits concrete
at 900 feet per second,

34:57.271 --> 34:58.680
it just doesn't have anywhere to go.

34:58.686 --> 34:59.761
Completely comes apart.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.710
Shooter had an itchy trigger finger.

35:05.460 --> 35:06.245
Also means he didn't have

35:06.280 --> 35:07.843
a lot of experience with firearms.

35:08.357 --> 35:09.144
Or she.

35:09.657 --> 35:10.880
You got someone in mind?

35:11.126 --> 35:12.908
Patrol just picked up Carla Marshall

35:12.909 --> 35:15.175
driving two blocks
away like a crazy woman.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.323
The PR mom?

35:16.396 --> 35:16.814
M m-hmm.

35:17.100 --> 35:19.254
With a.380 in the glove box.

35:20.570 --> 35:21.717
Yeah, that's half an inch.

35:21.925 --> 35:24.627
.380
- that seems about right. She had the means.

35:24.631 --> 35:27.342
And with Jojo as the
prosecution's star witness,

35:27.343 --> 35:29.179
she definitely had a motive.

35:29.357 --> 35:30.720
And the opportunity.

35:31.642 --> 35:32.783
Let's go talk to the mom.

35:33.357 --> 35:35.511
Carla, what were you doing
in front of that hotel?

35:38.451 --> 35:40.044
Look, if I did something wrong, just

35:40.514 --> 35:42.106
write me a ticket and let me go.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.617
I've spent enough time here today.

35:44.288 --> 35:45.695
This isn't about your driving.

35:46.109 --> 35:48.672
Jojo was shot in his hotel
room with a.380 handgun

35:48.684 --> 35:50.425
Just like the one we found in your car.

35:52.969 --> 35:54.228
He's dead?

35:54.672 --> 35:56.658
What were you doing with
that gun in your car?

35:59.326 --> 36:00.703
Okay, I-I...

36:02.244 --> 36:03.904
I thought about killing him.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.474
I wanted to. I,

36:06.127 --> 36:08.943
I sat in that parking
lot with a gun in my hand.

36:09.002 --> 36:09.922
You wanted him to pay

36:09.957 --> 36:11.443
for what he did to your daughter.

36:11.950 --> 36:14.643
Killing him would have just
pushed her farther away.

36:16.947 --> 36:19.149
I just want my little girl back.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.890
Oh, God.

36:28.738 --> 36:29.479
Excuse me.

36:34.224 --> 36:35.811
Mom's saying she
didn't pull the trigger.

36:35.812 --> 36:37.519
Yeah, her gun's saying the same thing.

36:37.590 --> 36:39.332
Hasn't been fired recently.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.649
So, we've hit a dead end.

36:42.650 --> 36:43.629
Not exactly.

36:44.043 --> 36:46.702
Trace under Jojo's fingernail
was a mix of opacifiers,

36:46.703 --> 36:48.342
alkali and white pigment.

36:48.349 --> 36:49.260
Which is...?

36:49.368 --> 36:51.701
Developing reagent in Polaroid film.

36:52.051 --> 36:53.160
When undeveloped,

36:53.160 --> 36:55.253
those chemicals are congealed
in a blob at one edge

36:55.255 --> 36:56.462
of the photographic sheet.

37:01.924 --> 37:04.180
I know someone who
takes a lot of Polaroids.

37:04.313 --> 37:05.691
We should call Horatio.

37:06.003 --> 37:07.425
I didn't kill anybody.

37:07.815 --> 37:11.207
We found chemicals from
a Polaroid photograph

37:11.242 --> 37:13.719
on Jojo's hands. Those are yours, right?

37:13.852 --> 37:15.833
We had a disagreement,
but that's all, you know?

37:15.868 --> 37:17.441
He wasn't paying his rent,

37:17.450 --> 37:19.205
and I got a business to run.

37:20.141 --> 37:21.506
You brought the cops here.

37:21.610 --> 37:22.786
Your credit is no good.

37:22.795 --> 37:24.038
Why don't you worry about that tomorrow?

37:24.048 --> 37:26.458
You're out of here tomorrow
if I don't see some cash.

37:26.459 --> 37:27.900
I don't owe you anything.

37:27.908 --> 37:30.060
I know what you look like.

37:30.061 --> 37:30.544
Hey!

37:32.914 --> 37:35.787
So, you went back there with a gun.

37:36.093 --> 37:38.293
No, I can't own a gun
because that would violate

37:38.302 --> 37:39.202
my probation.

37:39.203 --> 37:40.863
That didn't stop you
two years ago, though.

37:40.907 --> 37:43.437
Possession of an unlicensed firearm,

37:43.438 --> 37:46.112
and carrying a concealed weapon.

37:47.572 --> 37:49.563
Well, like you said,
that was two years ago.

37:49.618 --> 37:50.614
and you know what

37:50.619 --> 37:52.870
I've paid my debt to society,

37:52.885 --> 37:55.893
and I still can't get
you guys off my back?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.838
What does a guy have to do?

37:57.867 --> 38:01.024
When does this questioning
turn into harassment?

38:01.050 --> 38:03.006
Look, I know my rights.

38:03.020 --> 38:05.628
How long are you going to keep
me here without charging me?

38:05.631 --> 38:07.787
Horatio, did we get a confession?

38:07.793 --> 38:11.304
To an altercation with
Jojo, but not to murder.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.710
Yeah, a search of his possessions

38:12.711 --> 38:14.299
hasn't turned up any gun so far.

38:14.311 --> 38:16.041
And it probably won't.

38:17.076 --> 38:18.367
You think he's reformed?

38:18.533 --> 38:21.022
Highly unlikely. The man is a veteran.

38:22.238 --> 38:24.644
Yeah, he's not the type
to accidentally discharge

38:24.679 --> 38:25.427
a gun.

38:26.626 --> 38:28.134
So, we're looking for more of a rookie.

38:28.372 --> 38:31.788
Yes, someone we've met along the ride.

38:34.369 --> 38:36.633
Where were you this afternoon, Patrick?

38:37.775 --> 38:39.236
I was at home with my parents.

38:39.422 --> 38:40.880
Hmm.

38:42.686 --> 38:43.749
Patrick, do you remember

38:43.750 --> 38:45.038
when we talked about law

38:45.039 --> 38:47.210
enforcement officers
and telling the truth?

38:48.467 --> 38:48.945
Yeah.

38:48.946 --> 38:50.553
Okay, then let me ask you again.

38:50.736 --> 38:52.261
Where were you this afternoon?

38:53.247 --> 38:53.719
Home.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.703
So, you didn't stop off anywhere?

38:57.435 --> 38:58.157
Like where?

38:58.158 --> 38:59.677
Like the Fair Coast Hotel.

39:01.684 --> 39:02.102
No.

39:02.530 --> 39:03.395
Well, then you won't mind

39:03.430 --> 39:05.766
me doing a few tests to
eliminate some possibilities,

39:05.775 --> 39:06.821
then, will you?

39:24.003 --> 39:25.112
Stand up.

39:46.999 --> 39:48.481
I'm going to need your shoes.

40:16.338 --> 40:17.112
Patrick,

40:17.286 --> 40:19.621
we found a piece of
a bullet in your shoe.

40:20.433 --> 40:22.646
I was at the mini-mart
when the shooting went down.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.619
This bullet happened
to penetrate the floor

40:24.620 --> 40:26.255
in Jojo's hotel room.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.544
You never should've let him go.

40:37.615 --> 40:38.978
Jojo made bail,

40:39.061 --> 40:41.610
but he was still facing
prosecution, Patrick.

40:42.317 --> 40:43.521
He laughed at me.

40:45.170 --> 40:46.848
You're not even worth the bullet.

40:56.197 --> 40:57.614
You really think you can use that thing?

40:57.625 --> 40:59.558
You couldn't pull the
trigger if you wanted to.

40:59.593 --> 41:00.678
Shut up!

41:00.690 --> 41:01.381
That little bitch

41:01.382 --> 41:02.785
had a bigger pair than you do.

41:11.405 --> 41:13.128
Everything that I worked so hard for-

41:13.163 --> 41:14.146
he took it all away.

41:17.513 --> 41:18.319
Patrick...

41:19.777 --> 41:20.785
you did that.

41:47.965 --> 41:50.193
We're going to trial Patrick
Brookner as an adult.

41:51.151 --> 41:53.113
With your evidence, it
looks like a sure thing.

41:53.892 --> 41:55.281
Glad I could help.

41:56.583 --> 41:57.892
It's frightening, some of the people

41:57.893 --> 41:59.386
who want to work in law enforcement.

41:59.694 --> 42:02.598
Not everybody is cut out
to be a police officer.

42:03.249 --> 42:04.168
No kidding.

42:05.450 --> 42:07.395
Well, it only takes a second
to make a bad decision,

42:07.396 --> 42:08.469
doesn't it?

42:10.687 --> 42:11.671
Yeah.

42:15.028 --> 42:16.127
So,

42:17.227 --> 42:19.368
dinner tonight, my place?

42:21.221 --> 42:22.841
I’m not going to be able to do that.

42:24.056 --> 42:26.891
Let me guess. You're
visiting Insko's widow?

42:27.904 --> 42:30.972
Yeah. I'm going to go
see her and the kid.

42:31.652 --> 42:34.070
Okay, dessert, then. I'll
just leave the door...

42:34.071 --> 42:35.599
That's not going to happen, either.

42:40.705 --> 42:41.774
What's going on?

42:45.671 --> 42:48.773
Is this about what I said to Yelina?

42:50.851 --> 42:53.216
Um... no.

42:55.776 --> 43:00.351
Oh. So, it's the deal I made.

43:08.504 --> 43:10.950
I stand by my decision.

43:11.765 --> 43:14.166
And I stand by mine.
