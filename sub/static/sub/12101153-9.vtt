00:23.936 --> 00:25.634
Mom, wait!

00:27.331 --> 00:28.376
Mom!

00:30.334 --> 00:32.249
It's Nia!

00:32.293 --> 00:36.253
Come back, I need you!
Please, wait!

00:38.734 --> 00:40.388
[crows cawing]

00:54.184 --> 00:56.447
[theme music playing]

00:59.972 --> 01:01.278
[upbeat music playing]

01:01.322 --> 01:03.324
-And, go!
-Okay.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.673
She should be queen.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.327
-Uh, Meghan Markle.
-[Kelly] Yep.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.545
-Um...
-Thank you.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.852
Okay.
Pizza, moon, amore.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.246
-Dean Martin?
-[Kelly] Yes.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.160
-Easy.
-[Kelly chuckles]

01:13.203 --> 01:14.509
Typewriters?

01:14.552 --> 01:16.206
-Tom Hanks?
-Yes, babe!

01:16.250 --> 01:18.643
-God, you're so good at this.
-What in the world?

01:18.687 --> 01:19.862
Cheating.
This is cheating.

01:20.819 --> 01:23.257
-[device beeping]
-Time. Time.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.215
-And they win again.
-Come on!

01:25.955 --> 01:26.782
Yes!

01:27.565 --> 01:29.263
Really competitive.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.439
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you guys
were psychic.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.180
Well, we are starting
to finish each other's...

01:33.223 --> 01:35.356
Sandwiches.

01:35.399 --> 01:36.748
-Cute.
-Well, whatever it is,

01:36.792 --> 01:38.359
living together
certainly suits you.

01:38.402 --> 01:41.188
-Aw, thanks. We think so, too.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.233
All right. J'onn, Nia,
you're up.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.017
-You okay?
-[Nia] Yeah.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.715
It's just, um, with Brainy
taking Zor-El back to Argo,

01:46.758 --> 01:48.630
I guess I haven't
been sleeping that well.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.719
Well, maybe Lena
could team up with me
when she gets here.

01:50.762 --> 01:54.157
No, she's still back east,
looking for information
about her birth mother.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.290
I really hope
whatever she finds
brings her some peace.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.379
[Alex] Right?

01:58.422 --> 02:00.207
She's really had a rough go
with the Luthor side
of the family.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.383
That is putting it mildly.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.820
So, Kelly,
how's the social work
job going?

02:04.863 --> 02:08.084
Oh, I love it.
But it can be
pretty intense.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.738
I actually have
a new case tomorrow,

02:09.781 --> 02:14.395
with a 10-year-old
alien orphan
with EMP powers.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.311
His only family is
a brother in prison.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.747
That is heartbreaking.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.749
Well,
if anybody can help him,
it's you, babe,

02:20.792 --> 02:23.404
because empathy
is your superpower.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.580
Aw, that's really cute.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.103
Can you two please be
just a little more adorkable?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.757
-I don't think so.
-All right. Come on, Nia.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.759
Let's show these crazy kids
how to do it.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.196
[Andrea] What do
the Super Friends do
for fun?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.330
I mean, do they even have fun?
I want you three to find out.

02:36.373 --> 02:39.420
Andrea, it's not like
there's a Super Friends hotline
we can call.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.117
Well, then do
whatever you have to.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.729
Stalk them. Project a big "S"
in the night sky.

02:44.773 --> 02:47.341
Jump off a bridge,
so one of them
has to catch you.

02:47.384 --> 02:48.690
Then interview them
on your way down.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.388
I don't care how you do it,
just do it.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.129
I... I can't speak
for Supergirl,

02:53.173 --> 02:55.349
but I'm sure
she's too busy saving people

02:55.392 --> 02:58.221
with real emergencies
to do a celebrity puff piece.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.615
And I heard
that they don't even
like giving interviews.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.661
Well, are you forgetting
our exclusive with Dreamer?

03:03.705 --> 03:05.620
And how about
your tete-a-tete with Supergirl

03:05.663 --> 03:07.970
during my press tour
for Obsidian Platinum, hmm?

03:08.013 --> 03:09.232
I had assured her
that our conversations

03:09.276 --> 03:10.538
were off the record.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.801
Well, then get her
on the record.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.977
Every time we have
a Super Friend interview,

03:15.020 --> 03:17.022
CatCo Media tracker
skyrockets.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.896
We're at number three.
We need to be number one.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.246
[snores]

03:23.290 --> 03:24.291
Did she fall asleep?

03:27.685 --> 03:29.339
-Hey. Nia.
-Huh.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.345
Andrea, I am so sorry.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.478
Sleep on your own time,
not mine.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.306
Go home. You're taking
a mental health day.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.438
Now, you two,
you have 24 hours

03:41.482 --> 03:43.397
to get me an interview
with a Super Friend.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.399
Ideally, Supergirl.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.662
Fail and you'll find yourself

03:47.705 --> 03:49.533
writing classified ads
and obits.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.324
Back in London,
I once dressed up
as a pizza delivery guy

03:57.367 --> 03:59.282
to bluff my way

03:59.326 --> 04:00.501
into 10 Downing Street
to interview
the prime minister.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.893
-Did it work?
-No.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.721
All I got were a dozen pizzas
with extra cheese.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.854
[J'onn J'onzz]
Supergirl, I need your help.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.551
-I'm on my way.
-On your way where?

04:07.595 --> 04:09.466
To go pound the pavement.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.469
Okay.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.952
Thanks for coming.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.780
I've been monitoring
the NCPD scanners

04:18.823 --> 04:20.477
about a series
of truck robberies.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.697
Nothing seemed out
of the ordinary until now.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.351
Was this a Metalomite?

04:24.394 --> 04:26.527
They can bend any metal
just by using their minds.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.660
If there's one on the loose,
we'll have to
take care of it together.

04:29.704 --> 04:33.098
Yeah. That's not
from a Metalomite.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.193
-A residue
that turns things invisible?
-It's an Obscuran.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.544
Since when do
Obscurans and Metalomites
work together?

04:43.587 --> 04:46.503
Maybe what they're stealing
is enough to put away
their differences.

04:50.507 --> 04:54.642
So far, they've stolen
computer boards, motor oil,
steel casing.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.121
And from this truck?

04:56.165 --> 04:59.864
-Ammonium nitrate.
-They're building a bomb.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.788
Ms. Hochschild?
I'm Kelly Olsen.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.573
The new caseworker
for Joey Davis.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.357
Oh, yes,
please come in.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.924
Thank you.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.970
Oh, thank goodness
you're here.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.451
I've just been
at my wit's end with him.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.324
I hear Joey's having
behavioral issues.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.935
-What's going on?
-Well, he's picking fights.

05:26.978 --> 05:31.505
He's disobeying
me and my staff,
misusing his powers.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.724
Not only is it unsettling
for the other children,

05:33.768 --> 05:36.510
but I'm just worried
someone might get hurt.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.338
Did his file mention
that two days ago,

05:38.381 --> 05:41.297
he knocked out power
to the entire block?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.952
You know,
Joey's not usually like this.

05:43.995 --> 05:47.129
He's usually such
a sweet, kind boy.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.610
I mean, can you
think of anything
that might be upsetting him?

05:49.653 --> 05:52.395
I blame his brother Orlando.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.136
-In Van Kull Prison.
-Yeah.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.573
-Joey gets monthly
visitation with him?
-Mmm-hmm.

05:56.617 --> 05:59.228
This all started
after Joey last saw him.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.578
I mean, if you ask me,
he's bad news.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.712
I think it would be best
if the state
just stopped the visits.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.496
[girl] Marta, give it back.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.543
Oh! There, be careful.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.240
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

06:11.283 --> 06:14.852
Girls, I've told you
a thousand times.
No running in the house.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.550
Marta took my bread roll.

06:16.593 --> 06:22.120
According to the rules,
each child is expected
to respect

06:22.164 --> 06:25.297
the personal property
of their housemates.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.474
It was mine.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.172
This is a matter
of justice.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.565
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.747
Ah, the children wear
power-dampening cuffs?

06:39.790 --> 06:42.445
Oh, that's
a necessary precaution.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.405
I mean,
with ten alien children
under my care,

06:45.448 --> 06:47.668
their abilities
have to be controlled.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.584
When Joey gets angry,
he can overpower his.

06:52.368 --> 06:55.371
I'll help you
with Marta later, Esme.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.549
So, Joey is in his room.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.072
-Come, it's this way.
-Okay.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.995
You know, when something's
bothering me,

07:11.039 --> 07:13.171
talking about it
always seems to help.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.483
It must be hard living here,

07:20.527 --> 07:23.225
with your brother Orlando away.

07:23.268 --> 07:27.925
-What do you know about him?
-I know he's in prison.

07:27.969 --> 07:31.668
And by the look on your face,
when I said his name,

07:31.712 --> 07:34.541
you must care about him
an awful lot.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.020
You don't know
how I feel.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.197
You could tell me.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.030
I have a big brother, too.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.773
His name is Jimmy.

07:49.817 --> 07:54.430
And when we were kids,
he would do
all kinds of crazy things.

07:54.474 --> 07:59.914
Like... he would climb up
on a roof
and jump off of it.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.699
One time, he took
our dad's car for a ride.

08:04.222 --> 08:07.748
My brother is
the bravest person I know,

08:07.791 --> 08:10.620
and I still worry about him.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.188
Because that's what you do
for people you love.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.800
There's something wrong
with my brother.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.759
Why do you say that?

08:18.802 --> 08:22.240
Last time I saw him,
he had dark circles
under his eyes.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.286
We get them
if we use our powers a lot.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.593
We get sick
if we use them too much.

08:26.636 --> 08:29.596
You think your brother's
using his powers in prison?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.293
For his job.

08:31.336 --> 08:34.557
I don't know what you call it,
but he gets to go out to do it.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.428
He's in a work-release program.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.780
He told me not to worry,
but I can't help it.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.391
He took care of me
after our mom and dad died.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.611
He only robbed
that store to get money

08:44.654 --> 08:47.004
for a place for us to live.

08:47.048 --> 08:50.704
He says
we'll be together again
when he gets out.

08:50.747 --> 08:54.272
But what if his job
makes him really sick?

08:55.404 --> 08:56.884
What if he dies?

08:56.927 --> 09:00.235
I am going to do all that I can
to help you and Orlando.

09:01.802 --> 09:05.806
You know, a good friend of mine
knows the warden at the prison.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.721
She might be able to help.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.680
-I don't wanna
get him in trouble.
-It's gonna be okay.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.030
I promise.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.821
According to the manifest,
that truck was carrying

09:20.864 --> 09:22.474
over 5,000 pounds
of ammonium nitrate.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.999
That much explosive
could level
a 50-story building.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.957
Well, we can use the residue
that we found

09:27.001 --> 09:28.829
to track the Obscuran
energy signature,

09:28.872 --> 09:31.353
and hopefully,
the bombmakers.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.615
Hey.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.097
Are you okay?

09:36.140 --> 09:38.273
The alien orphan Joey
that I was telling you about?

09:38.316 --> 09:39.535
Yeah?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.232
I'm worried.
The poor kid's been acting out

09:41.276 --> 09:43.408
because he believes
his brother is overusing

09:43.452 --> 09:47.456
his EMP powers
at his work-release program
at the Van Kull Prison.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.066
You mean
the Second Chances program?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.981
I did an article on that
when it first started.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.679
That's why I'm here.

09:52.722 --> 09:57.466
Joey says
that if his brother Orlando
uses his powers too much,

09:57.509 --> 09:59.033
he could die.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.688
When I interviewed the warden,
the program seemed amazing.

10:01.731 --> 10:04.429
They contracted
with a clothing manufacturer

10:04.473 --> 10:06.388
to give jobs
to incarcerated workers.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.738
From what I saw,
they were treated really well.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.522
So, if Orlando's
making clothing,

10:10.566 --> 10:13.134
then why would he need
to use his EMP powers?

10:13.177 --> 10:15.702
Is it because
he's being forced to?

10:15.745 --> 10:18.748
Or maybe he's using them
for some self-serving purpose?

10:18.792 --> 10:21.882
Either way, something bad
is happening to Orlando,

10:21.925 --> 10:23.753
and it's affecting Joey.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.146
I need to find out.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.322
Can you help me get in
to talk to the warden?

10:27.365 --> 10:29.106
Yeah, of course.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.673
-Can you guys handle
the truck robberies?
-[J'onn J'onzz] Sure.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.544
If we discover something,
we'll call.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.431
Mom, I am going to reach you.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.703
Mom. Mom!

11:02.574 --> 11:03.575
It's Nia!

11:05.142 --> 11:06.491
[grunts]

11:08.276 --> 11:10.757
I've got this.
You don't have to
wake yourself up.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.460
-Don't be scared.
-Who are you?
What do you want?

11:19.591 --> 11:21.158
My name is Nyxly.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.247
Wait, I've seen you before.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.773
You were in my dreams.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.818
Not exactly in them.

11:28.862 --> 11:32.517
I crashed them,
and not on purpose.
I'm stuck here.

11:33.867 --> 11:37.871
I'm so grateful I found you.
I need your help.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.178
And you need mine.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.798
What do you mean
you crashed my dreams?

11:51.841 --> 11:56.933
An evil man took my powers
and banished me
from my dimension.

11:56.977 --> 12:00.676
In my weakened state,
I couldn't cross the barrier
into your real world,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.678
and I got trapped here.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.725
Only Naltorians
are supposed to be able
to enter the dream realm

12:05.768 --> 12:06.769
in physical form.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.641
Technically,
not only Naltorians.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.689
I'm from the 5th Dimension.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.648
-You're an imp.
-An imp stripped
of my powers.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.302
Well, mostly.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.958
I still have
some small remnant
of magic left,

12:22.002 --> 12:23.481
enough to sense you.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.791
It took me ages to find you,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.794
but I knew that you were
my only chance
of getting out of here.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.535
What makes you think
I can help?

12:33.578 --> 12:35.929
On occasion,
Naltorian women have been known

12:35.972 --> 12:38.714
to manifest their dreams
in the real world.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.848
That's nothing to mess with.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.981
It's dangerous to interfere
with the laws of the universe.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.942
I get it. But sometimes,
you have to take
a chance, Nia.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.990
I would never ask you
to take a risk alone.

12:54.034 --> 12:57.124
If you help me,
I will go to great lengths
to help you.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.040
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I don't need any help.

13:00.083 --> 13:04.131
I don't mean to pry,
but I have seen
your dreams, Nia.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.656
You miss your mother.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.833
You need to see her,
and I know exactly
how that feels.

13:10.877 --> 13:14.054
I desperately miss
my brother and my father.

13:14.097 --> 13:17.971
I have to get home
to see them.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.844
We can help each other, Nia.
If you get me
out of this dream realm,

13:21.888 --> 13:25.021
I will have enough power
to bring your mother
back to life.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.676
Bringing someone back
from the dead, that's...

13:30.940 --> 13:35.423
a serious infraction
of universal law.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.991
I know imps are powerful,
but I didn't know
they could do that.

13:38.034 --> 13:42.299
We can.
With some limits.

13:42.343 --> 13:46.782
I can only bring
your mother back to life
for exactly one day.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.002
-Really?
-In a snap.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.352
You and I have
such similar needs,

13:51.395 --> 13:54.007
to be reunited
with our families.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.966
It's destiny
that we help each other.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.230
-What do you say?
-I... I...

14:02.580 --> 14:04.278
[screeching]

14:06.758 --> 14:08.586
[breathing heavily]

14:17.987 --> 14:19.597
Thank you.
Hi, Warden.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.599
Thank you so much
for seeing us.

14:21.643 --> 14:25.299
Always a pleasure
to see CatCo's star reporter
and her friend.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.041
What can I do for you today?

14:28.084 --> 14:30.434
We're here about the prison's
Second Chances program.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.655
There's nothing I enjoy
talking about more.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.962
We're literally
changing lives.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.312
Thanks in no small part
to you, Miss Danvers.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.053
Since your article came out,

14:40.096 --> 14:42.969
donors and corporate sponsors
have been beating down
our door.

14:43.012 --> 14:46.973
That's great. Most people
just see prison
as a place to punish people.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.975
They see the crime
and not the person.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.020
Not us. We respect our workers.

14:51.064 --> 14:55.024
We teach them new skills,
which helps them
reenter society

14:55.068 --> 14:57.331
as valuable
and productive members.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.942
Which is why I was worried
when I heard from Kelly.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.814
Uh, she has a young client
who has a brother
in the program.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.513
-There might be a problem.
-Yeah, he's worried
his brother is

15:05.556 --> 15:09.734
being injured
overusing his EMP powers
on the job.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.998
We don't know
if he's a victim
or an instigator.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.088
I can't imagine a scenario
where either one of those
is true.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.917
So, there have been
no incidents
involving EMP powers?

15:17.960 --> 15:22.182
All aliens are continuously
monitored on the work site,

15:22.225 --> 15:25.185
and if anyone
had used their powers,
I would know about it.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.535
-What's the worker's name?
-Orlando Davis.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.754
Well, I promise you,
I'll check into it.

15:29.798 --> 15:33.106
And if there's anything
to the boy's concerns,
I'll take care of it.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.936
Could we see Orlando?
I would love to tell Joey
that we did.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.415
I'm sorry.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.896
All visits need to be requested
two weeks in advance.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.985
In your next article,
you could shed some light

15:43.029 --> 15:46.119
on all
the bureaucratic red tape
around here.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.947
[chuckles]

15:49.122 --> 15:50.427
[Kelly] You sure
this is gonna work?

15:50.471 --> 15:52.473
You do remember I'm Supergirl?

15:53.822 --> 15:55.171
Hi.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.087
Kara Danvers and Kelly Olsen
to see Orlando Davis.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.567
Okay.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.351
[typing]

16:03.919 --> 16:06.008
Jeez. One moment.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.535
[typing rapidly]

16:19.108 --> 16:20.675
Sorry. What was
that name again?

16:20.718 --> 16:22.938
Uh, you know what?
Actually, we made a mistake.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.940
Uh, thanks, but we're gonna
come back another time.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.637
Okay.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.118
-What's wrong?
-Orlando is already
on his way to his job.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.124
[officer] Orlando Davis.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.821
Oh, there's Orlando.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.084
[officer] Keep it moving.

16:38.127 --> 16:41.087
I said look alive, Orlando.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.219
[Kelly] For someone having
all of the opportunities

16:43.263 --> 16:46.179
the warden touted,
he doesn't look very happy.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.919
No, he doesn't.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.315
Good thing I can fly.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.465
J'onn?

17:55.509 --> 17:57.815
I tracked
the Obscuran energy signature
to this spot.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.166
Chances are
the Metalomite is there, too.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.559
And a Toradine and a Dynamorph.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.953
That van just pulled
those incarcerated aliens

18:04.996 --> 18:06.824
from a work-release site.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.392
One of them is
the brother of the orphan
Kelly was telling us about.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.265
Why would they be here?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.442
[Orlando] It's crazy
doing this in daylight.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.008
[officer]
It's what the boss wants.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.489
Anyone tries to stop us,
you boys can stop them.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.753
No. No, you can make us steal,
but we don't hurt people.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.278
You do as you're told,
or the one getting hurt is you.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.715
They're being forced
to steal against their will.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.730
They're building
a dirty nuke.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.736
-It's Supergirl!
-Pull out, now!

18:48.779 --> 18:50.390
-[prisoner 1] Let's move.
-[prisoner 2] Hold up.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.695
-Hurry, hurry.
-Start the van!

18:54.220 --> 18:55.090
[Supergirl grunts]

18:58.267 --> 18:59.355
[groans]

19:00.226 --> 19:01.314
All right. Hit it!

19:11.454 --> 19:15.502
The whereabouts
of the five alien workers
are unknown at this time,

19:15.545 --> 19:18.722
but we believe that
while they were making
their escape,

19:18.766 --> 19:22.335
they kidnapped
Van Kull officer Larry Chapman.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.033
That officer
held them at gunpoint.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.774
We need to find them.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.776
Well, it's obvious someone
who's infiltrated
the prison program

19:28.819 --> 19:32.171
is using Orlando
and the other workers
for their alien powers.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.433
Exactly.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.826
So, we have a Metalomite
who can warp metal,

19:35.870 --> 19:37.611
a Toradine
who creates force fields,

19:37.654 --> 19:40.004
an Obscuran
who has cloaking abilities,

19:40.048 --> 19:42.964
and a Dynamorph
who can unleash energy blasts.

19:43.007 --> 19:46.446
And Orlando is a Zeltarian
who can produce EMPs.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.708
I promised Joey I'd help,

19:47.751 --> 19:50.363
and all I did was
put his brother in danger.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.887
They were threatened.
I should have been able
to save them.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.932
The only people to blame
are those behind all this.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.412
Well, whoever they are,
if they're dead set

19:56.456 --> 19:58.109
on getting their hands
on a dirty bomb,

19:58.153 --> 20:00.590
then they're bound to target
other sources of uranium.

20:00.634 --> 20:01.852
Well, we can't
let that happen,

20:01.896 --> 20:03.419
or they'd have
enough material

20:03.463 --> 20:05.334
-to make 20 bombs.
-Contaminate the whole city.

20:05.378 --> 20:09.425
We can start by following
all five alien
energy signatures.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.253
Right now,
there's no trace of them.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.124
They must be shielded somehow.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.823
I don't know,
I'll look for ways around it.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.955
While you do that,
I'm gonna head back
to the prison.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.480
Warden Kote
needs to know the truth.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.324
I should have run Joey's
concerns about Orlando

20:38.367 --> 20:39.934
through the proper channels.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.241
I only made things
worse for everyone.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.330
It was because of you
wanting to help Joey

20:44.373 --> 20:47.855
that we found out
about Orlando and the others
being exploited,

20:47.898 --> 20:50.510
which then led us
to finding out
about the bomb.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.251
The system is stacked
against them,

20:52.294 --> 20:55.123
and I don't know why I thought
I could do anything about it.

20:55.166 --> 21:00.041
The Kelly Olsen
that I know and that I love,
she never gives up.

21:00.084 --> 21:03.566
When we rescued Kara
from the Phantom Zone,

21:03.610 --> 21:04.872
do you remember
when you asked me

21:04.915 --> 21:07.309
if I was sure
if I wanted to go?

21:07.353 --> 21:08.571
Yeah, I remember.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.487
I was afraid that I wouldn't
be able to help.

21:14.229 --> 21:17.711
So, my Fear Vision,
I was attacked

21:17.754 --> 21:20.496
by Phantom versions
of you and the others.

21:22.716 --> 21:26.285
Telling me
that I would never...

21:26.328 --> 21:30.550
be able to compete
with everyone's powers
and intellect.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.942
That I was weak.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.295
Maybe it was right.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.557
I don't believe that.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.472
You have to say that,
you're my girlfriend.

21:39.515 --> 21:40.864
No, I don't.

21:43.389 --> 21:46.870
So... tell me
how the Fear Vision ended.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.483
[sighs] I, um...

21:52.267 --> 21:58.142
I realized that even
if I couldn't fight
your Phantom selves,

21:58.186 --> 22:00.884
maybe I could
protect you instead.

22:02.451 --> 22:05.367
So, I found
a piece of shrapnel.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.369
It reminded me
of Jimmy's Guardian shield.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.544
Hmm.

22:11.242 --> 22:15.377
And I used it
to get between all of you
and the Prime Phantom.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.904
And, yeah, it worked.
I brought you back.

22:22.515 --> 22:25.126
Well, of course you did.

22:25.169 --> 22:28.825
Because you are strong,
and you are smart,

22:28.869 --> 22:30.610
and you are powerful.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.308
Hey, we all have doubts,

22:33.352 --> 22:35.919
but it's when you thought
that you could protect me,

22:35.963 --> 22:38.531
you took a risk.

22:38.574 --> 22:39.967
And it's only
when we take risks

22:40.010 --> 22:41.577
that we can really find out

22:41.621 --> 22:43.623
who we're meant to be.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.452
And Joey...

22:46.495 --> 22:49.411
is very lucky to have you
in his corner,

22:49.455 --> 22:52.240
because you are a protector.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.199
And you'll always
be there for him.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.289
Come here.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.475
I don't believe it.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.433
I'm sorry,
but there is corruption

23:11.477 --> 23:13.304
in the Second Chances
program.

23:13.348 --> 23:16.743
The idea
that anyone would abuse
the workers like that,

23:17.570 --> 23:18.614
it's unconscionable.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.181
That is why
we have to figure out

23:20.224 --> 23:21.965
who could have
infiltrated the program.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.924
And I'm telling you
that that's impossible.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.361
I personally put strict
safeguards in place.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.146
Look, I know this is hard,
but this is so much more

23:29.190 --> 23:32.062
than just a series
of truck robberies.

23:32.106 --> 23:35.152
Whoever's orchestrating this
is building a dirty bomb.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.938
-Where did you hear that?
-Supergirl told me.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.592
That's why
you needed to know
the truth.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.507
I want to give you the chance
to go on the record.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.552
You can't write this story.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.772
Without proof,
they'll shut my program down.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.905
Don't let the actions
of a small group of criminals

23:48.949 --> 23:51.168
ruin the good we're doing.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.388
-Warden, I--
-Kara, I promise you

23:53.432 --> 23:56.609
that I will do
a full internal investigation

23:56.652 --> 23:59.960
once the alien escapees
have been captured,

24:00.003 --> 24:03.311
and once Officer Chapman
is found safe.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.618
I don't understand
why you can't just
see the truth.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.184
You just need to drop this!

24:08.925 --> 24:12.538
I'm sorry.
This is just a very
tense situation

24:12.581 --> 24:16.019
involving dangerous alien
criminals.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.501
You can do a story
after this all turns out

24:19.545 --> 24:21.634
to just be a misunderstanding.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.686
Wait. Wait. Mom!

24:31.470 --> 24:32.427
Mom, I need you!

24:33.689 --> 24:34.690
[yelps]

24:34.734 --> 24:35.561
Mom!

24:36.692 --> 24:39.478
[Nyxly] Nia. You're back.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.611
Thank goodness.

24:42.655 --> 24:46.963
I'm sorry our conversation
got interrupted
by that vicious owl.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.617
We were just about
to make a deal.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.707
Thanks. But no thanks.

24:51.751 --> 24:56.190
-I don't understand.
-Nyxly... I don't know you.

24:56.233 --> 25:00.455
But I do know
that imps on the whole
are not to be trusted.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.111
How would you like
to be judged
by your species, Nia?

25:04.154 --> 25:05.939
-Aren't you a hero on Earth?
-Yes, but--

25:05.982 --> 25:08.463
I can grant
your dearest wish, Nia.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.598
And you can end this cycle
of tormented dreams,

25:12.641 --> 25:15.296
and finally see your mum
for 24 hours.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.776
-Don't you want that?
-Of course I do.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.255
Then let's help each other!

25:21.215 --> 25:23.391
-[owl hooting]
-[Nyxly groans]

25:23.434 --> 25:24.914
That monstrous bird.

25:25.785 --> 25:28.396
Get out of here! Shoo!

25:28.439 --> 25:31.094
[owl] The wise understand
by themselves, Nia.

25:31.138 --> 25:34.402
Fools follow the words
of others.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.360
Don't listen
to that stupid owl.

25:36.404 --> 25:39.581
Owls will bring to light
what is in the dark.

25:40.669 --> 25:43.019
-They're symbols of truth.
-Nonsense.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.674
That is
a ferocious bird of prey
who's looking at us

25:45.718 --> 25:48.285
like a pair
of tiny little tasty sparrows.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.200
She's trying
to divide and conquer us, Nia,

25:50.244 --> 25:52.725
so that she can devour us
for breakfast.

25:52.768 --> 25:56.467
I don't think owls
are that devious.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.817
My mother revered them.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.080
[owl] Wisdom lies
not in seeing things,

26:00.123 --> 26:01.603
but in seeing
through them.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.171
Oh, shut up, you ghoul.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.128
Nia...

26:05.172 --> 26:06.826
[scoffs]

26:06.869 --> 26:10.612
I have been
around the universe,
and that creature is evil.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.396
You saw how she attacked me.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.355
Don't let her mess
with your mind.

26:14.398 --> 26:17.184
Please, let's get us
out of here

26:17.227 --> 26:19.360
and get you reunited
with your mum.

26:19.882 --> 26:21.797
I don't know.

26:21.841 --> 26:22.972
You can trust me.

26:25.671 --> 26:26.846
[owl screeches]

26:26.889 --> 26:29.196
Ugh! Leave us alone!

26:39.815 --> 26:40.903
[William] What are you
working on?

26:40.947 --> 26:42.339
I'm trying to find out
as much as I can

26:42.383 --> 26:44.428
about Warden Kote
at Van Kull Prison.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.648
Your friend
doesn't still work
for the CIA, do they?

26:46.692 --> 26:48.389
Yeah. Why?

26:48.432 --> 26:49.564
You're looking
for a deep dive
on the warden?

26:49.608 --> 26:50.870
Would you mind asking?

26:50.913 --> 26:52.393
Sure. Happy to help.

26:52.436 --> 26:55.701
Oh, good.
Then help me
understand this.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.138
I gave you two an assignment.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.661
Get me an interview
with one of the Super Friends.

26:59.705 --> 27:04.057
Now, two of them
were at the same place
at the same time,

27:04.100 --> 27:06.407
and where were you?

27:06.450 --> 27:08.148
-Not there.
-Andrea, we can actually--

27:08.191 --> 27:10.019
No, no, no.
I don't want to hear
your excuses.

27:10.063 --> 27:14.067
Not only did you miss
a golden opportunity
to get me what I want,

27:14.110 --> 27:16.983
but CatCo was scooped
by every other news outlet.

27:17.026 --> 27:20.943
I can't bring myself
to look at our media tracker
ratings after this.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.771
Who cares
about the ratings?

27:23.685 --> 27:24.555
What?

27:25.208 --> 27:26.906
I, uh...

27:26.949 --> 27:29.256
You keep saying
you want CatCo to be

27:29.299 --> 27:32.738
the most trusted
source of news
in National City.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.609
Yes. Of course I do.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.264
Our readers need hard-hitting
and truthful reporting

27:37.307 --> 27:39.048
-now more than ever.
-Then let us do our job,

27:39.092 --> 27:41.572
instead of making us chase
the Super Friends around.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.009
They aren't the story.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.881
For any of us to do our jobs,
CatCo needs eyeballs,

27:45.925 --> 27:48.231
and the Super Friends
can get them for us.

27:48.275 --> 27:51.104
The more we have,
the better our ratings,

27:51.147 --> 27:52.975
the better our bottom line.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.847
And that's the reality.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.326
I suggest
you remember that.

27:58.502 --> 27:59.808
Now, back to work.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.332
[sighs]

28:02.376 --> 28:03.464
[Joey exclaims]

28:03.507 --> 28:05.553
[Ms. Hochschild]
Joey... Joey, stop this.

28:05.596 --> 28:06.989
Joey, I'm warning you.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.165
[groaning]

28:09.209 --> 28:10.993
-[Joey] It hurts.
-What are you doing?

28:11.037 --> 28:12.821
I'm suppressing his powers.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.736
He's in pain.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.738
No, he is fine.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.567
[groaning and panting]

28:24.180 --> 28:26.661
What on earth
are you doing here?

28:28.010 --> 28:31.144
I came to check on Joey,
and I am glad I did.

28:31.187 --> 28:34.321
He is obviously terrified
about his brother,

28:34.364 --> 28:35.801
and this is how you treat him?

28:35.844 --> 28:37.890
You may not agree
with my methods,

28:37.933 --> 28:40.501
but it is my job
to keep this place in order,

28:40.544 --> 28:44.418
and to teach those kids
that actions
have consequences.

28:44.461 --> 28:47.987
I wonder how your bosses
would feel about
your teaching methods

28:48.030 --> 28:49.989
if they ever saw
the security videos.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.033
Do you think anyone has time

28:51.077 --> 28:52.600
to look at
what goes on in here?

28:52.643 --> 28:55.298
If you're not gonna
protect these children...

28:56.473 --> 28:57.126
I will.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.172
Listen, Ms. Olsen.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.477
I have been working
in this system

29:00.521 --> 29:03.045
longer than
you've been alive.

29:03.089 --> 29:06.135
So, go ahead.
I wish you all the best.

29:15.928 --> 29:19.975
So, from what I see,
there is no way
the warden could afford

29:20.019 --> 29:22.543
a luxury beach house,
luxury cars,

29:22.586 --> 29:24.937
and first-class travel
on his prison salary.

29:24.980 --> 29:29.202
No, but he could by having
a secret offshore account
in the Caymans.

29:29.245 --> 29:31.508
My buddy in the CIA
just sent me these.

29:32.901 --> 29:35.034
[sighs, clicks tongue]

29:35.077 --> 29:39.647
I mean, he's been depositing
large sums of money
on a regular basis.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.258
Well, I guess
what they say is true.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.739
-Follow the money.
-I'm sorry, Kara.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.785
When you wrote your article
on the work-release program,

29:46.828 --> 29:48.308
I remember how highly
you thought of him

29:48.351 --> 29:49.788
and what he was
trying to accomplish.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.225
Yeah, I was a fool
for believing in him.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.183
It's not your fault
he's corrupt.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.924
Power can bring out
the best in some people,

29:55.968 --> 29:58.840
and the worst in others.

29:58.884 --> 30:02.104
Look, there's very little
oversight for private,
for-profit prisons.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.714
I'm sure
that made it easier
for the warden

30:03.758 --> 30:05.760
to become vulnerable
to outside influences.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.895
The question is,
who's doing the influencing?

30:09.938 --> 30:12.245
The prison contracted
Summerlin Industries

30:12.288 --> 30:14.290
for the work-release program.

30:14.334 --> 30:17.641
I traced it through two dozen
different subsidiaries
and tax ID numbers.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.818
-Yeah, no doubt,
shell companies.
-Mmm.

30:21.123 --> 30:23.517
The trail dead-ends
with an LLC

30:23.560 --> 30:26.868
registered in Panama
under the name
Cypress Holdings.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.043
I know that name.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.049
Yes. I was looking
into Cypress Holdings

30:34.093 --> 30:35.398
while you were away
with Cat Grant.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.226
I had good reason
to suspect it had ties

30:37.270 --> 30:39.098
to Mob boss
Bruno Mannheim's Intergang,

30:39.141 --> 30:40.795
but never could prove
a direct link.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.190
That's it. Cypress Holdings
is a front for Intergang.

30:44.233 --> 30:47.019
William, you're brilliant.
I gotta go. Thank you.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.890
Sure.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.937
Kara Danvers,
she came to see me again.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.070
It is only a matter of time
before the truth comes out.

30:55.114 --> 30:58.030
Maybe you should bring
those workers back
and we can make up a story

30:58.073 --> 31:00.641
-and go back
to the way it was.
-It's too late.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.904
Nobody said anything
about a dirty bomb.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.471
It's what Mr. Mannheim wants.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.908
We're going after
the uranium again tonight.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.344
When the job's done,

31:08.388 --> 31:11.391
you don't have to worry
about the truth getting out.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.830
The alien workers will be dead.

32:05.227 --> 32:08.491
You were right, Kara.
I searched all known
Intergang hideouts.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.319
Picked up an energy signature.

32:10.363 --> 32:13.932
They must be using it
to conceal Orlando
and the other aliens.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.936
That's their van.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.894
[Officer Chapman] Listen up.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.115
After tonight, your services
will no longer be needed.

32:23.158 --> 32:26.292
I'll deactivate your
power-dampening cuffs,
and you'll be free.

32:26.335 --> 32:27.989
You're just gonna let us go?

32:28.859 --> 32:30.470
You have my word.

32:31.862 --> 32:33.777
Okay, time to move out.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.216
No one's going anywhere.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.317
You heard the man.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.193
It's okay.
You're safe now.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.761
We know
that you've been forced
to use your powers to steal,

33:00.804 --> 33:02.850
that you didn't kidnap
Officer Chapman.

33:02.893 --> 33:06.027
We're gonna take you
back to the prison
and explain everything.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.115
Let's get you out of here.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.032
We're getting out of here,
but not with you.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.126
[both grunting]

33:27.701 --> 33:29.268
[Supergirl] Please,
we just want to help.

33:29.311 --> 33:30.921
Like we haven't heard
that before.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.368
Let us pass!

33:48.069 --> 33:51.290
He's collapsing the building!
I've got it.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.468
You want to take us back...

33:55.511 --> 33:58.297
to explain,
to make it all okay?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.168
You don't get it.

34:00.212 --> 34:03.302
The system doesn't care.
It never has.
And it never will.

34:03.345 --> 34:06.653
You're right. I don't know
what will happen.

34:06.696 --> 34:10.396
But I do know
that if you decide
to go on the run...

34:10.439 --> 34:14.182
that system
will never stop
hunting you.

34:14.226 --> 34:19.100
You will never know
a moment's peace,
and neither will Joey.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.275
What do you know
about my brother?

34:20.319 --> 34:22.190
That you have
shared hardships,

34:22.234 --> 34:25.498
that you love
and need each other.

34:25.541 --> 34:29.328
I begged Social Services
for help...

34:30.198 --> 34:32.331
but they didn't listen.

34:32.374 --> 34:36.335
And who's gonna rent a place
to a guy making minimum wage?

34:36.378 --> 34:38.989
So, I tried to rob a store.

34:39.033 --> 34:42.210
When you're desperate,
you'll do anything.

34:42.254 --> 34:46.345
In prison,
I believed what they said...

34:46.388 --> 34:49.174
that the work-release program
would be the answer

34:49.217 --> 34:51.567
to Joey and me
being together again.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.702
It turned out to be
another lie.

34:58.008 --> 35:00.054
Face it, okay?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.665
No one wants to help
people like me.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.278
People like them.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.280
I'm an alien
on this planet, too.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.064
I've seen
how hard life can be

35:10.108 --> 35:12.588
for the people
that the system
isn't designed for,

35:12.632 --> 35:16.505
how that system can fail
those less fortunate.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.683
But I promise you,
if you come with me,

35:20.727 --> 35:22.555
I will do everything
in my power

35:22.598 --> 35:24.513
to make sure
your voices are heard.

35:27.995 --> 35:28.909
Please.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.056
Please...

35:47.362 --> 35:48.842
don't let us down.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.410
I won't.

35:57.416 --> 36:01.333
Tonight, Van Kull Prison warden
Wyatt Kote and others
were arrested

36:01.376 --> 36:02.856
in connection
with an alleged plot

36:02.899 --> 36:05.206
to use aliens in the prison's
work-release program

36:05.250 --> 36:08.470
to commit crimes
for the notorious
Intergang Mob syndicate.

36:08.514 --> 36:11.212
Here with me to discuss it
is Supergirl.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.214
Thank you for joining us.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.781
If these allegations
are true,

36:14.824 --> 36:16.609
how could something
like this happen?

36:16.652 --> 36:18.654
Well, clearly,
the system is broken

36:18.698 --> 36:20.308
when those in power
are allowed

36:20.352 --> 36:23.006
to abuse that power
entrusted to them.

36:23.050 --> 36:26.836
I'm angry that criminals
were allowed to infiltrate

36:26.880 --> 36:29.056
a worthwhile program
like Second Chances,

36:29.099 --> 36:31.450
but I'm glad that it will
continue with new oversight.

36:31.493 --> 36:34.453
And what do you think
should be done
with the alien workers?

36:34.496 --> 36:37.456
They should be
shown leniency.

36:37.499 --> 36:40.241
Now, that's
the kind of reporting
I'd like to see.

36:40.285 --> 36:41.938
Great job, William.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.984
Kara, you should take a page
out of William's book.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.770
Okay. Everybody,
back to work.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.384
[William] Just so you know,
Supergirl came to me
at the scene.

36:52.427 --> 36:55.430
-It was dumb luck
I was the one.
-I'm glad you were there.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.477
Well, Andrea is happy.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.261
Yeah, but she still
doesn't get it.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.611
I mean, this is so much more
than an interview
with Supergirl.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.483
This is about
telling the public

37:04.526 --> 37:06.267
the truth about issues
that matter.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.835
Well, we shined a light
on what was happening
at the prison,

37:08.878 --> 37:11.707
we exposed the abuse,
and we stopped
an Intergang crime spree.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.101
What about the abuse
that's happening
in other places?

37:14.144 --> 37:16.277
We will root them out
and report on them, too.

37:16.321 --> 37:20.673
When? In between our stories
about the Super Friends'
favorite hobbies?

37:20.716 --> 37:22.501
Okay, don't hate me
for saying this,

37:22.544 --> 37:24.242
but I think Andrea
has a point.

37:25.721 --> 37:28.333
When Supergirl speaks,
people listen.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.510
If an interview with her
could make people
hear the message...

37:32.467 --> 37:33.381
I'm all for it.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.824
I don't know how
that security video

37:41.868 --> 37:44.436
ended up
in my supervisor's inbox.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.176
It's obviously a fake.

37:46.220 --> 37:49.876
I mean, somebody must have
hacked my computer.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.444
Is she really
gone for good?

37:52.487 --> 37:54.620
Yes. You all deserve
to be protected

37:54.663 --> 37:56.535
by someone
who cares about you.

37:57.579 --> 38:00.190
And I have one more
surprise for you.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.019
Orlando!

38:05.370 --> 38:06.762
Come here.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.287
What are you doing here?

38:09.330 --> 38:11.332
The judge pardoned me,
said it was unfair

38:11.376 --> 38:13.378
what they did to me
and the others.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.816
Which means I'm out.
I'm never going back.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.430
[mouthing]
Thank you.

38:31.091 --> 38:32.092
Oh!

38:32.135 --> 38:35.095
You did all of this,
didn't you?

38:35.138 --> 38:38.968
Sorry, Esme,
I, um... I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.406
Don't worry,
I'll keep your secret.

38:41.449 --> 38:45.323
This house needed
a guardian angel.
And now, we have you.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.334
-Hey.
-Hi.

38:56.377 --> 38:57.422
Rough day?

38:57.465 --> 38:59.206
It definitely started that way.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.603
-Thank you.
-Of course.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.213
But for the first time...

39:07.257 --> 39:08.476
in a long time...

39:10.391 --> 39:12.219
I felt completely exhilarated.

39:12.262 --> 39:13.525
I felt empowered.

39:13.568 --> 39:16.615
And today, I saw
I made a real difference.

39:16.658 --> 39:21.663
I told you,
the Kelly Olsen that I love
never gives up.

39:23.491 --> 39:26.189
I know
what I need to do, Alex.

39:26.233 --> 39:30.411
This community
needs someone who is
willing to fight for them,

39:30.455 --> 39:32.848
even when the system
isn't listening.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.633
Yeah.

39:34.676 --> 39:37.200
It's time to pick up
where Jimmy left off.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.596
I want to be the new Guardian.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.817
I have something for you.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.296
What?

39:47.602 --> 39:48.473
Okay.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.086
What is this?

39:53.129 --> 39:54.217
[Kelly chuckles]

39:55.218 --> 39:56.045
Okay.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.048
Open it.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.623
The moment I saw you use
that shield during Crisis,

40:08.667 --> 40:11.844
I had a hunch
that this might be coming.

40:11.887 --> 40:14.455
So, I reached out to James.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.632
And he sent this for you.

40:17.676 --> 40:21.506
I don't think there
is anyone better fit
to be the next Guardian.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.337
I don't know what to say...

40:30.166 --> 40:32.081
except I love you.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.389
Yeah, we'll see how you feel
after we start your training.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.086
[both laughing]

40:38.174 --> 40:39.001
Hey.

40:40.655 --> 40:41.830
[sighs]

40:41.874 --> 40:44.006
-To Guardian.
-To Guardian.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.413
-Mom.
-You came back.

41:04.374 --> 41:06.681
Do you really just want
to go back
to the 5th Dimension?

41:06.725 --> 41:09.554
As soon as I get out of here
and replenish my powers,

41:09.597 --> 41:10.816
I'll go straight home.

41:10.859 --> 41:13.079
And if I help you,

41:14.254 --> 41:15.211
we have a deal.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.564
And you bring my mom back
for 24 hours.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.217
Imps never break their deals.

41:22.784 --> 41:23.916
Are you in?

41:24.743 --> 41:26.353
[owl hooting]

41:47.548 --> 41:48.810
I'm in.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.646
[theme music playing]
