00:02.742 --> 00:04.944
<i>Hey, mom, can
Amber come over tonight?</i>

00:05.032 --> 00:06.991
<i>I don't know.
What about your homework?</i>

00:07.079 --> 00:08.229
<i>I already did it
in school.</i>

00:08.317 --> 00:09.763
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

00:09.851 --> 00:11.635
<i>Well, let's talk about
it after dinner.</i>

00:11.813 --> 00:13.138
Ok, mom.

00:40.302 --> 00:41.800
We still got
left over meatloaf.

00:41.887 --> 00:42.975
You want to do that?

00:43.062 --> 00:44.442
Sure.

01:16.882 --> 01:18.192
What's wrong?

01:33.301 --> 01:35.003
- Mom! Mom!
- Mom!

01:35.106 --> 01:36.847
Hi, guys.

01:37.652 --> 01:39.574
You don't look sick, mom.

01:39.855 --> 01:40.939
Oh, I'm not,
sweetie.

01:41.027 --> 01:42.369
I'm... I'm just
resting.

01:42.457 --> 01:43.712
Are you going
to throw up?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.653
No, no, I'm fine.

01:45.909 --> 01:46.966
Here, mommy.

01:47.054 --> 01:48.244
Ahh.

01:48.332 --> 01:50.235
She made you a sandwich.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.840
Heh. Why,
thank you, Lily.

01:54.066 --> 01:56.355
It's tuna fish.
And peanut butter.

01:56.443 --> 01:57.504
Yeah, I see that.

01:57.592 --> 01:58.775
All right, kids.
That's enough.

01:58.862 --> 02:00.380
Come on, your mom needs
some peace and quiet.

02:00.467 --> 02:01.543
Let's go. <i>- Okay</i>

02:01.631 --> 02:03.465
- <i>I want to play monopoly.</i>
- Come on.

02:06.523 --> 02:08.222
- Phew.
- Mm-hmm.

02:09.515 --> 02:10.785
Yikes.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.074
All right, so you remember
the ground rules?

02:13.216 --> 02:15.481
The doctor said
24 to 48 hours

02:15.569 --> 02:16.987
complete bed rest.

02:17.075 --> 02:18.990
Not here and there
bed rest, complete.

02:19.078 --> 02:20.123
Oh.

02:20.211 --> 02:22.401
And if you need anything...

02:23.968 --> 02:26.411
Just ring and I will
come and take care of it.

02:26.615 --> 02:29.670
Well, let's test
this thing out.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.847
I need a kiss.

02:33.790 --> 02:36.044
<i>I'm telling mom.
And I'm telling dad.</i>

02:36.270 --> 02:38.060
You sure you're
up to this?

02:38.148 --> 02:40.238
Well, administrative
day at school, no sitters,

02:40.326 --> 02:41.849
so I better be up to it.

02:41.937 --> 02:43.208
Ugh.

02:43.350 --> 02:45.285
I might be the first woman
to give birth

02:45.373 --> 02:47.471
- to a beach ball.
- Well, just hang in there.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.216
Number 5.

02:49.304 --> 02:50.366
Number 5.

02:50.454 --> 02:52.576
Have we totally
lost our minds?

02:54.054 --> 02:55.403
You start resting.

02:55.786 --> 02:57.220
Now.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.069
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah, thanks.

03:03.157 --> 03:04.462
Appreciate that.

03:09.975 --> 03:11.263
You're back.

03:11.599 --> 03:13.888
Hi. Yeah, thought
I'd get in early,

03:13.975 --> 03:15.552
stake out my spot.

03:16.953 --> 03:18.041
Mmm.

03:18.206 --> 03:19.786
Feels like old times.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.419
It does.

03:21.708 --> 03:22.966
That's good, right?

03:23.054 --> 03:24.273
It's great.

03:24.581 --> 03:26.763
JJ, oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god.

03:26.908 --> 03:28.576
JJ! Oh, my god.
Look at that.

03:28.685 --> 03:30.544
Look at you. Ohh, hey.

03:30.632 --> 03:31.724
Hi.it's me.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.857
Hi.

03:34.232 --> 03:35.784
Missed you.

03:36.114 --> 03:37.333
Hey, there.

03:38.512 --> 03:40.693
Hey. Welcome back.
So good to have you back.

03:40.781 --> 03:41.913
Great to be here.

03:44.919 --> 03:48.005
We did discuss you
maybe easing back

03:48.093 --> 03:49.302
into things slowly.

03:49.606 --> 03:51.630
Emily, I'm good
to go, really.

03:51.718 --> 03:53.060
I even brought
a permission slip

03:53.148 --> 03:54.427
from my doctor.

03:54.724 --> 03:55.935
Promise me,

03:56.039 --> 03:58.177
no jumping out of
helicopters.

03:58.388 --> 03:59.877
Only as a last resort.

04:00.130 --> 04:01.270
You have my word.

04:01.358 --> 04:02.640
So what have we got?

04:02.728 --> 04:04.602
Well, the two mail
bombing deaths

04:04.690 --> 04:06.472
we've been monitoring
in Ohio

04:06.560 --> 04:09.021
and Kentucky, third one
just happened in Memphis.

04:09.109 --> 04:10.507
We aren't
monitoring anymore.

04:10.595 --> 04:12.075
This case is now
our top priority.

04:12.194 --> 04:13.978
Two victims
are Rhonda Kirkman

04:14.065 --> 04:15.284
and her daughter Sophia,

04:15.371 --> 04:18.113
but unlike Joseph ainsworth
and Sheila stecher,

04:18.200 --> 04:19.857
both of these sweet
souls have survived.

04:19.945 --> 04:22.573
Apparently that blast
wasn't as strong as the others.

04:22.661 --> 04:24.849
Mother and daughter
are in critical condition, though.

04:24.937 --> 04:27.200
And we still don't know
how these bombs were sent?

04:27.322 --> 04:30.020
None of the traditional mail
carriers sent any packages

04:30.108 --> 04:32.126
to the victims on
the days of the attacks.

04:32.214 --> 04:34.185
Well, good chance he
dropped them off himself.

04:34.273 --> 04:36.130
Well, that'd be
a significant deviation

04:36.218 --> 04:37.784
from the traditional
m.O. Of a mail bomber.

04:37.871 --> 04:39.439
Most don't get anywhere
near their victims.

04:39.526 --> 04:42.669
And I wonder why the third
bomb didn't pack the same punch.

04:42.802 --> 04:44.238
Device malfunction, maybe?

04:44.326 --> 04:45.630
That would be my guess.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.771
Guys like this don't
usually dial down the violence,

04:47.859 --> 04:49.005
they escalate.

04:49.093 --> 04:50.436
Well, if this latest bomb
was less powerful,

04:50.523 --> 04:52.917
hopefully we have more
forensic evidence to sift through.

04:53.107 --> 04:55.183
What I'm worried about
is a pissed off unsub.

04:55.349 --> 04:56.708
He botched this one.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.998
We can be damn sure
the next attack will get the job done

05:00.138 --> 05:01.380
and then some.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.561
Kristy's on mandated
bed rest,

05:02.648 --> 05:04.420
so Matt will stay behind
and consult by phone.

05:04.507 --> 05:07.684
His military experience
with munitions should be helpful.

05:07.814 --> 05:09.857
For the rest of us,
wheels up in 10.

05:21.209 --> 05:22.645
It's 250, right?

05:22.927 --> 05:25.794
Plus tip, if you're
so inclined.

05:29.067 --> 05:32.208
Ok, let's do this.

05:34.177 --> 05:36.637
One red hot,
stone cold cadaver

05:36.725 --> 05:37.942
coming up.

05:40.191 --> 05:42.113
You said this
would be a woman.

05:42.481 --> 05:44.373
Body stealing business,
sometimes you take the...

05:44.460 --> 05:46.348
No, man, we agreed that
this would be a woman.

05:46.443 --> 05:49.043
Dead's dead.
What the hell's the difference?

05:51.980 --> 05:55.299
Oh, you don't got to go
this route, buddy.

05:55.729 --> 05:58.408
They've got online
dating sites now.

05:58.496 --> 06:00.759
Spruce up a little.
You're not a bad-looking guy.

06:01.172 --> 06:03.122
Learn a little
ballroom dancing.

06:04.975 --> 06:08.544
I'm joking, man.
Just yanking your chain.

06:10.702 --> 06:13.348
Ok, uh, this transaction,

06:13.436 --> 06:15.481
the merchandise
being what it is,

06:15.597 --> 06:16.966
all sales are final.

06:17.054 --> 06:18.795
So you want
the stiff or not?

06:21.256 --> 06:22.388
Yeah, put it in.

06:22.476 --> 06:25.261
Mm-mmm.
Free shipping stops here.

06:25.692 --> 06:27.223
Put it in yourself.

Margaret Mitchell.

08:36.970 --> 08:38.578
Rhonda Kirkman
and her daughter

08:38.666 --> 08:39.804
are still in the ICU.

08:39.892 --> 08:42.047
Friends, packaging received
from the latest bombing

08:42.134 --> 08:44.958
had U.S. postage, but curiously, no
cancellation marks.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.568
Well, the unsub put them on
just to make them look legit.

08:47.656 --> 08:48.818
So it's what
we theorized.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.708
He's hand delivering
the bombs.

08:50.796 --> 08:53.357
Risky business
exposing yourself like that.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.482
Most bombers are
cowards who do their

08:55.570 --> 08:56.749
dirty work from
the shadows.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.102
You know, there's
something else missing

08:58.189 --> 08:59.569
that we usually find with
this type of killer...

08:59.656 --> 09:00.708
A manifesto,

09:00.796 --> 09:02.779
some sort of cause they
wish to espouse.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.216
Ted kaczynski,
Eric Rudolph,

09:04.304 --> 09:06.810
Timothy McVeigh,
bombers tend to be fanatics

09:06.898 --> 09:08.310
driven by extreme
ideologies.

09:08.398 --> 09:10.318
Victimology's also
tough on this one.

09:10.405 --> 09:12.560
Garcia, still nothing to
connect the victims?

09:12.648 --> 09:14.278
They are homo sapiens
on the planet earth,

09:14.365 --> 09:17.237
but besides that... age, race, ethnicity...
It's one big mash up.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.109
Well, they had one
thing in common...

09:19.488 --> 09:21.379
The unsub wanted
them all dead.

09:21.636 --> 09:24.549
Tara, you and Luke go take a look
at the latest crime scene.

09:24.637 --> 09:26.533
Reid, jj, you'll head
to the hospital.

09:26.621 --> 09:28.354
Dave and I will set up
with local law enforcement

09:28.441 --> 09:29.859
once we land.

09:33.629 --> 09:36.205
So how's kristy's
bed rest going?

09:36.293 --> 09:38.767
She's complying, but
she's not happy about it.

09:38.855 --> 09:40.994
And I am being that
hard-ass hall monitor

09:41.082 --> 09:42.219
that everybody hates.

09:42.306 --> 09:44.135
Have you had a chance
to review that bomb evidence

09:44.222 --> 09:45.213
we sent you?

09:45.301 --> 09:46.759
Yeah, that's why
I'm calling.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.269
So we're definitely
dealing with one unsub here.

09:49.357 --> 09:52.588
The assembly and packaging
in all 3 attacks are identical.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.980
Those bombs didn't look
especially sophisticated.

09:56.146 --> 09:57.234
No, they're not.

09:57.321 --> 09:58.801
You stumble across
the right website,

09:58.888 --> 10:01.018
and your average person
could probably put these together.

10:01.105 --> 10:03.463
One more thing.
It looks like each package contained

10:03.551 --> 10:04.845
a book of some kind.

10:04.933 --> 10:06.775
Maybe that's what set off
the explosive.

10:06.863 --> 10:08.884
You open the cover, boom.

10:08.972 --> 10:09.987
That was my
initial thought, too,

10:10.074 --> 10:13.056
but I'm not seeing any
spring-loaded triggers.

10:13.144 --> 10:15.424
Then what then, a timer?

10:15.512 --> 10:17.113
No, no timing
devices, either.

10:18.871 --> 10:20.752
I think these explosives
are being detonated

10:20.840 --> 10:21.877
via remote control.

10:21.965 --> 10:23.478
Ok, I'll let you go.

10:23.565 --> 10:25.218
So what are your
kiddie plans for today?

10:25.305 --> 10:26.481
Oh, we're gonna go big.

10:26.569 --> 10:29.668
Uh, cook a fancy meal,
maybe play a board game.

10:29.787 --> 10:30.963
Board game?

10:31.051 --> 10:32.089
Yeah, I've got one
here I bought

10:32.176 --> 10:34.010
in Thailand years ago,
haven't opened yet.

10:34.097 --> 10:36.590
Attenzione alla varieta.

10:36.839 --> 10:38.025
Translation?

10:38.129 --> 10:40.814
Roughly, deviate
from video games

10:40.902 --> 10:42.181
at your own risk.

10:42.269 --> 10:44.080
Thanks.

10:44.168 --> 10:46.370
Buona fortuna.

10:49.152 --> 10:52.861
Photo album. This must
be the book Matt was talking about.

10:52.949 --> 10:54.861
Yeah, similar albums
were pieced together

10:54.949 --> 10:56.206
at the other crime scenes.

10:56.293 --> 10:57.903
We're trying to track down
where they were purchased.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.978
Any actual photographs
recovered?

11:00.066 --> 11:02.125
Only this one from
Rhonda's house.

11:02.212 --> 11:03.692
But check this out.

11:05.607 --> 11:08.436
He sent Rhonda a picture
of her own house.

11:08.523 --> 11:10.525
Her house, but...

11:10.840 --> 11:13.528
What else?

11:13.863 --> 11:15.878
So what
do you think? Huh?

11:16.245 --> 11:18.465
We're gonna choose something
we've never eaten before,

11:18.801 --> 11:21.187
we're gonna make it
from scratch together.

11:21.274 --> 11:22.798
Why can't we eat
something normal?

11:22.885 --> 11:23.929
Like pizza.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.644
Because we eat normal
all the time.

11:26.863 --> 11:28.215
Come on, you guys,
it'll be fun.

11:28.303 --> 11:29.436
We'll make extra
for your mommy.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.741
We're gonna surprise her.

11:30.936 --> 11:32.895
Here's what we'll do.
I'm gonna close my eyes

11:33.105 --> 11:35.941
and move my finger,
and when you say "stop,"

11:36.191 --> 11:38.509
the book I'm pointing to,
no matter what,

11:38.596 --> 11:40.084
we'll fix what's
on the cover.

11:40.172 --> 11:41.564
Sound good?

11:43.514 --> 11:45.385
Loving the enthusiasm.

11:45.573 --> 11:47.401
Ok, here we go.

11:48.532 --> 11:50.316
Mmm.

11:52.093 --> 11:53.457
Stop.

11:59.965 --> 12:01.363
"Modern Moroccan."

12:01.532 --> 12:07.105
Basilla with dejaj...
Dajaj... daja...

12:07.233 --> 12:08.294
All right, it's
a little complicated.

12:08.381 --> 12:10.149
We're gonna check and see
what the ingredients are.

12:10.236 --> 12:15.183
Ginger, ok. Turmeric,
crumbled saffron threads?

12:15.397 --> 12:18.324
Crumbled
saffron threads.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.283
How does pizza sound,
you guys?

12:23.948 --> 12:25.582
Yeah, let's do...
Let's do pizza.

12:26.688 --> 12:27.732
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

12:27.819 --> 12:31.613
Pizza.

12:37.699 --> 12:39.871
Mr. and Mrs. Kirkman,
I'm Dr. Reid.

12:40.049 --> 12:42.617
I'm ssa Jennifer jareau.
We're with the FBI.

12:42.704 --> 12:44.619
The doctors said
you'd be coming.

12:44.706 --> 12:46.142
We're very sorry
about what happened

12:46.229 --> 12:47.709
to your daughter
and grandchild.

12:47.796 --> 12:48.902
Thank you.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.929
We know that this
is a difficult time, but...

12:51.016 --> 12:53.642
No, no, ask
your questions.

12:53.730 --> 12:55.924
Neither one of us has
had much sleep, though.

12:56.012 --> 12:58.254
Flights were all booked
so we drove down from Michigan.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.475
Yeah, straight
through the night.

13:00.762 --> 13:03.097
Do you have any idea who
might have done this?

13:03.496 --> 13:04.918
Not at all.

13:05.192 --> 13:06.846
Everybody loves Rhonda.

13:06.934 --> 13:09.327
She didn't have
an enemy in the world.

13:11.397 --> 13:12.833
Mr. Kirkman?

13:13.621 --> 13:17.472
My wife cuts people
too much slack.

13:17.687 --> 13:19.246
Rhonda's got an ex
you need to check out.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.831
- Fred.
- No, these people need

13:20.919 --> 13:22.309
to know, Laura.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.887
Randall gilman.

13:24.176 --> 13:26.355
Rhonda divorced that
s.O.B. Last summer,

13:26.443 --> 13:28.341
and when she got
custody of Sophia,

13:28.429 --> 13:29.942
he said he was gonna
make her pay.

13:30.013 --> 13:31.160
- That's not what he meant by that.
- No, no,

13:31.247 --> 13:33.409
exact words.
Make her pay.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.833
Excuse me, Mr.
And Mrs. Kirkman.

13:35.973 --> 13:37.065
Rhonda's still in surgery,

13:37.152 --> 13:38.631
but if you want to see
your granddaughter

13:38.718 --> 13:40.356
for a few minutes,
come with me.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.701
Oh, my god, Sophia.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.682
Please find who did this.

13:54.993 --> 13:56.411
Please.

14:00.436 --> 14:02.823
Ok, so we spoke to
Rhonda's neighbors,

14:02.911 --> 14:05.105
and they echo what people said
about the previous victims...

14:05.192 --> 14:06.399
Quiet and well liked.

14:06.486 --> 14:08.139
Yeah, she worked
a normal job,

14:08.294 --> 14:10.010
middle of the road politics,

14:10.098 --> 14:12.056
not involved in any
controversial causes.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.323
Ok, so we have no
obvious shared ideology

14:14.411 --> 14:15.472
among the victims
that might have

14:15.559 --> 14:16.674
angered our unsub.

14:16.762 --> 14:18.721
Well, maybe it's
an internal ideology

14:18.809 --> 14:19.971
unique to him.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.417
You know, they crossed some
line only he understands.

14:22.505 --> 14:23.807
It's rare with bombers,

14:23.894 --> 14:26.070
but maybe our killer's
choosing his victims randomly.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.985
JJ said Rhonda had an ex
we were looking at.

14:28.072 --> 14:30.148
Looked at and cleared.
Solid alibi.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.375
And he had no motive
to kill the other two victims.

14:32.463 --> 14:33.938
So we're back to
square one.

14:35.768 --> 14:37.386
Reid's working up
a geo profile,

14:37.473 --> 14:39.250
but for now,
it's anyone's guess

14:39.338 --> 14:41.223
where our unsub
will strike next.

15:05.541 --> 15:08.286
So it looks like
this resists traditional geo profiling.

15:08.373 --> 15:10.376
Attack sites are
often like spokes

15:10.463 --> 15:12.689
emanating from a single hub,
but that isn't the case here.

15:12.776 --> 15:14.467
It's more random,
scattershot.

15:14.554 --> 15:15.917
I think the unsub lives
in a different part

15:16.004 --> 15:17.102
of the country altogether.

15:17.190 --> 15:20.124
That might be why
he's reluctant to mail his packages.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.533
He's out of his element.

15:21.650 --> 15:22.922
He's also sadistic.

15:23.010 --> 15:26.086
He wants to watch
his victims die with his own eyes.

15:26.268 --> 15:27.610
Agents?

15:27.932 --> 15:30.994
I went to the post office
to pick up Rhonda's mail,

15:31.595 --> 15:32.885
and...

15:35.618 --> 15:37.490
"Your presence
is requested

15:37.577 --> 15:39.622
"at the funeral of
Rhonda Kirkman.

15:39.979 --> 15:41.752
Fun and games to follow."

15:41.913 --> 15:43.627
This was enclosed.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.873
We contacted
the family members

16:50.961 --> 16:52.488
of the first two
bombing victims.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.317
They found posthumous
funeral notices

16:54.404 --> 16:55.361
in the mail as well.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.406
Same message?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.084
"Fun and games
to follow."

16:58.172 --> 16:59.615
Well, let's just hope
it's a taunt

16:59.703 --> 17:00.708
and not a warning
of things

17:00.795 --> 17:02.209
to come.

17:02.297 --> 17:04.326
Matt, how are things
going on the home front?

17:04.414 --> 17:05.589
So far so good.

17:05.683 --> 17:08.262
And how'd that
michelin-starred meal pan out?

17:08.351 --> 17:11.340
Well, it's hard to go wrong
with pepperoni and cheese.

17:11.568 --> 17:13.858
So listen, I took another
look at the evidence

17:13.944 --> 17:16.137
from the Rhonda Kirkman
crime scene.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.288
And while the dimensions
of the device look the same

17:18.375 --> 17:19.333
as the previous bombs...

17:19.421 --> 17:21.223
Height, width, and length...

17:21.381 --> 17:24.388
The actual blast radius
had diminished by almost half.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.240
The thing is,
I'm not seeing anything that

17:26.328 --> 17:27.522
suggests a misfire.

17:27.654 --> 17:30.744
So he deliberately made
the bomb less powerful?

17:30.831 --> 17:31.982
And less deadly.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.271
The shrapnel from the first
two bombs were nasty...

17:34.373 --> 17:36.597
Thumbtacks, razors, nails...

17:36.685 --> 17:38.996
But Rhonda's bomb was
filled with ball bearings,

17:39.084 --> 17:41.435
small ones, like
bb gun pellets.

17:41.554 --> 17:44.810
Increasing the chance that
Rhonda and Sophia would survive.

17:44.904 --> 17:47.068
I don't know why
he'd do this except to

17:47.322 --> 17:48.457
prolong the trauma.

17:48.623 --> 17:50.787
If they don't survive,
how can they suffer?

17:50.875 --> 17:52.006
Thanks, Matt.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.943
Another bomb just went off
about an hour south of here.

17:56.068 --> 17:58.457
One confirmed fatality.
Atf is on site.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.556
It looks like our guy.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.681
Back-to-back attacks
on consecutive days.

18:01.769 --> 18:02.602
He's accelerating.

18:02.689 --> 18:04.735
Law enforcement's
breathing down his neck.

18:04.822 --> 18:07.295
He must know his window
to wreak havoc is closing.

18:07.383 --> 18:09.087
Apparently our unsub's
back in the saddle.

18:09.209 --> 18:10.654
This blast was
full octane,

18:10.741 --> 18:12.403
so whatever the hiccup
was with Rhonda Kirkman,

18:12.490 --> 18:14.224
he fixed it.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.244
Not laughing now,
are you?

18:51.790 --> 18:53.549
Not so funny, huh?

18:53.637 --> 18:54.820
I don't hear you laughing.

18:54.908 --> 18:56.923
Aah!

18:57.011 --> 18:58.189
What's so funny?

18:58.277 --> 19:00.095
Stop! No!

19:02.508 --> 19:03.509
Mom!

19:03.597 --> 19:04.816
Help me!

19:11.464 --> 19:13.092
Ok.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.655
Garcia still can't find
a link between the victims.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.547
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.396
- What are you thinking?
- There's no logic in

19:19.483 --> 19:20.786
sending funeral notices

19:20.874 --> 19:22.233
to people he already killed.

19:22.321 --> 19:23.932
I think they were meant
for somebody else.

19:24.019 --> 19:25.827
That's why Garcia's
coming up empty.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.569
The connection here
isn't among the victims,

19:28.732 --> 19:30.764
but in the pool of
surviving loved ones.

19:30.852 --> 19:31.853
Exactly.

19:31.941 --> 19:33.121
Couple of hours ago,
police responded

19:33.208 --> 19:34.551
to a noise complaint
in millington,

19:34.638 --> 19:35.987
about 10 miles
north of here.

19:36.147 --> 19:37.845
They found a blown-up
shed in a field.

19:37.973 --> 19:40.378
There was a male
cadaver inside.

19:44.438 --> 19:48.003
I just wanted to see
that stunningly handsome face

19:48.144 --> 19:51.365
and admire those broad,
squared off shoulders.

19:51.453 --> 19:52.672
No.

19:52.760 --> 19:53.848
No what?

19:53.936 --> 19:55.932
No, you can't get up
and move around

19:56.020 --> 19:57.021
for just 5 minutes.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.112
Fine.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.417
How's the
board game going?

19:59.505 --> 20:00.800
Labor intensive.

20:00.888 --> 20:03.284
For starters,
the instructions are in thai.

20:03.372 --> 20:05.591
Then the dice turned
out just to be blank cubes

20:05.679 --> 20:07.681
that you have to lick
and stick dots on by hand.

20:07.769 --> 20:08.814
You're kidding.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.237
No, and it took us
half an hour,

20:10.325 --> 20:11.718
then the very first
roll, they just

20:12.808 --> 20:14.244
Fluttered off
like confetti.

20:14.332 --> 20:17.276
So now Jake's trying to
draw them on with a pen,

20:17.892 --> 20:19.722
but the ink won't stick.

20:21.442 --> 20:23.444
Something else is
bothering you.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.433
Uhh.

20:30.592 --> 20:32.377
We have a little
girl in Tennessee

20:32.466 --> 20:33.641
who's fighting
for her life.

20:36.298 --> 20:37.620
Sometimes I wish
I could just...

20:38.756 --> 20:40.292
Snap my fingers
and make all the bad

20:40.380 --> 20:41.401
in the world go away.

20:41.489 --> 20:43.175
Dad! Oh!

20:44.105 --> 20:45.591
They're playing my song.

20:47.533 --> 20:48.861
I love you.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.447
Now go out there
and show them

20:51.535 --> 20:52.797
how to do it
old school.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.278
Ok.

20:54.467 --> 20:55.903
Will do.

20:55.991 --> 20:57.732
<i>What did you do?</i>

20:57.820 --> 20:59.561
<i>I didn't
do anything!</i>

21:01.567 --> 21:03.220
Ok.

21:05.814 --> 21:07.119
Is everything
ok, dad?

21:07.279 --> 21:09.456
Yeah, everything's
fine, son.

21:10.213 --> 21:15.148
Ok, let's start
with Lily.

21:15.236 --> 21:17.291
I think we need
to find another game.

21:17.379 --> 21:19.424
There's nothing
on the dice.

21:20.651 --> 21:22.127
Of course there is.

21:22.215 --> 21:24.026
You're just not looking
hard enough.

21:24.793 --> 21:27.926
Ok. All right, Lily.

21:32.123 --> 21:33.603
5.

21:34.338 --> 21:35.736
Thank you so much
for coming in.

21:35.824 --> 21:37.956
They said you wanted us to
take a look at some pictures.

21:38.043 --> 21:39.854
If you don't mind,
they're right in here.

21:52.252 --> 21:54.018
I don't recognize
any of these people.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.072
Me, neither.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.127
Take your time.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.544
Try focusing on one group

21:57.632 --> 21:59.286
before moving on
to the next.

21:59.374 --> 22:00.636
Who are they,
anyway?

22:00.724 --> 22:03.904
Family members of the other 3
victims, like you.

22:04.637 --> 22:07.549
So I think...
2, 3, 4...

22:07.934 --> 22:10.916
Lily has 8 to win.

22:11.004 --> 22:13.137
Yeah, but 2, 6, or 7,

22:13.380 --> 22:14.658
and you're dead.

22:16.682 --> 22:18.205
No pressure.

22:18.510 --> 22:19.635
Here you go.

22:28.529 --> 22:29.486
8!

22:30.707 --> 22:31.838
We have a winner!

22:31.985 --> 22:32.986
Nice!

22:33.097 --> 22:34.549
Yes!

22:45.058 --> 22:46.189
I'll be damned.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.409
Fred.

22:47.752 --> 22:49.424
Yeah.

22:51.151 --> 22:53.240
How did you do this?

22:55.578 --> 22:57.131
How do you know
these people?

22:57.250 --> 22:59.426
We met on a cruise
last month.

22:59.826 --> 23:01.811
Went up the St. Lawrence
river in Canada.

23:01.899 --> 23:04.459
Yeah, the boat docked
for the day in Montreal,

23:04.547 --> 23:06.475
and the 5 of us
decided to rent a car,

23:06.563 --> 23:09.327
go drive around the
countryside on our own.

23:11.081 --> 23:12.082
So here's what we know.

23:12.209 --> 23:15.300
These 5 people
rented a car together

23:15.388 --> 23:17.607
in Montreal
on October 2.

23:17.695 --> 23:18.957
And within weeks,

23:19.045 --> 23:20.334
all of them had
loved ones

23:20.422 --> 23:22.186
who were attacked
by our unsub...

23:22.276 --> 23:24.569
Joseph ainsworth,
Colin's father,

23:24.657 --> 23:27.092
Sheila stecher,
the sister of Wanda,

23:27.180 --> 23:29.399
and Joel Reynolds,
Meg's father.

23:29.703 --> 23:31.631
And this is the route
they took.

23:31.719 --> 23:34.592
They stopped for lunch,
then went back to the boat.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.492
Somewhere along the way,
they encountered the unsub.

23:36.579 --> 23:37.584
Must have.

23:37.672 --> 23:39.065
We should bring
Fred and Laura in

23:39.153 --> 23:40.553
for a cognitive
with Dave.

23:40.648 --> 23:42.320
We should also place them
in protective custody.

23:42.407 --> 23:44.975
We don't know who's next,
but this unsub isn't finished.

23:45.419 --> 23:48.280
Ok, do you remember
the male cadaver

23:48.368 --> 23:49.543
they retrieved
from that shed?

23:49.631 --> 23:51.589
Not the sort of thing
one forgets.

23:51.677 --> 23:54.245
Well, allow me to make him
a little more unforgettable.

23:54.366 --> 23:57.131
Turns out our boy was
wearing a bright yellow dress,

23:57.421 --> 23:59.901
and they retrieved
vintage lady's sunglasses.

23:59.988 --> 24:02.415
So the unsub dressed him
up to resemble a woman...

24:02.503 --> 24:03.557
A surrogate.

24:03.644 --> 24:05.650
And then blew him
to smithereens...

24:05.738 --> 24:06.822
Overkill.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.329
Yeah, this guy's approaching
the ultimate source of his rage.

24:09.433 --> 24:11.187
We could be looking
at an end game here.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.276
Ok, Luke, get down to the
hospital, beef up security.

24:13.363 --> 24:14.681
Got it.

24:15.687 --> 24:17.181
Getting some coffee.
Want some?

24:17.310 --> 24:18.398
Mm-mmm.

24:33.438 --> 24:34.874
Visiting someone?

24:34.962 --> 24:38.876
Yeah, my, uh, daughter
and granddaughter.

24:41.986 --> 24:43.579
I'm here
for my mom.

24:44.237 --> 24:45.282
She was in an accident.

24:45.557 --> 24:47.341
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:47.429 --> 24:51.220
I'm hoping maybe this
might cheer her up.

24:52.478 --> 24:53.962
I'm sure it will.

24:54.124 --> 24:55.478
Which doctor
do you guys have,

24:55.566 --> 24:57.132
um, your daughter
and granddaughter?

24:57.219 --> 24:58.392
Dr. Delaney.

24:58.557 --> 25:00.026
That's my mom's doctor,
too, actually.

25:00.113 --> 25:01.419
Everyone says he's amazing.

25:01.615 --> 25:03.313
Good.

25:03.401 --> 25:04.571
You have a nice evening.

25:04.659 --> 25:05.877
You, too.

25:09.111 --> 25:10.854
All right, let's see
if you can have

25:10.942 --> 25:13.336
one of your officers post
up here in the waiting room.

25:15.504 --> 25:17.319
I don't want anybody
going into this room

25:17.407 --> 25:18.806
that's not authorized
medical personnel,

25:18.893 --> 25:20.181
no exceptions.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.401
We're gonna need
a police officer

25:21.488 --> 25:23.463
to take Mr. and Mrs.
Kirkman down to the police station,

25:23.550 --> 25:24.986
make sure that they
understand what's going on.

25:25.073 --> 25:26.597
Yes, sir.

25:26.684 --> 25:27.736
What's that?

25:28.369 --> 25:29.816
I don't know.
It wasn't there

25:29.904 --> 25:31.876
when I made my rounds
a minute ago.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.647
Get the patient
out of here now,

25:33.734 --> 25:35.170
and clear this
entire floor now.

25:35.257 --> 25:36.742
Shouldn't we wait until
the bomb squad gets here?

25:36.829 --> 25:37.869
No, there's no time.

25:37.957 --> 25:39.470
He's using a remote.

25:39.890 --> 25:42.153
Let's go.
Get her out.

25:59.752 --> 26:01.234
Hang on a second.
JJ's walking in.

26:01.322 --> 26:02.477
Does anybody know
what happened?

26:02.564 --> 26:03.804
No, Luke was there,

26:03.892 --> 26:05.515
and then everybody
started evacuating,

26:05.603 --> 26:07.030
and then no one was
there but Luke,

26:07.118 --> 26:08.416
and I don't know
what happened to him.

26:08.503 --> 26:09.549
The hospital's on lockdown,

26:09.636 --> 26:10.856
but there's no signs
of an explosion.

26:10.943 --> 26:12.798
Emily and Dave should
be there by now.

26:12.886 --> 26:14.158
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

26:14.245 --> 26:15.290
You let me know if
you find anything,

26:15.377 --> 26:16.829
but we need to
find something.

26:23.822 --> 26:25.103
Luke, are you ok?

26:25.198 --> 26:26.384
I'm fine.

26:27.175 --> 26:29.431
I won't need any caffeine
for a while, though.

26:30.116 --> 26:31.368
Did it misfire?

26:31.456 --> 26:32.868
No, it was never
rigged to go off.

26:32.956 --> 26:34.697
I think it was
just for show.

26:37.982 --> 26:40.790
He came out of Sophia's room.
He's got to be our guy.

26:41.022 --> 26:42.830
Laura already ID'd him
as the man who sat

26:42.918 --> 26:44.158
and talked with her
in the waiting room.

26:44.245 --> 26:45.463
She'd never
seen him before?

26:45.582 --> 26:47.118
Nope, not here,
not in Canada.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.719
If the unsub's goal
all this time has been

26:48.806 --> 26:50.854
to punish and eventually kill
Rhonda and her daughter,

26:50.941 --> 26:52.540
he just had his best
chance to finish the job.

26:52.627 --> 26:53.650
Why didn't he take it?

26:53.738 --> 26:56.532
The same reason he made their
initial bomb less lethal.

26:56.620 --> 26:58.822
He wants them to survive
in order to suffer,

26:58.910 --> 26:59.939
string out the pain.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.733
Why only them,
not the other victims?

27:01.821 --> 27:02.909
We're missing something.

27:03.076 --> 27:04.479
Well, Dave's about to
start his cognitive

27:04.566 --> 27:05.789
with Fred Kirkman.
Maybe we'll find

27:05.876 --> 27:07.400
some answers there.

27:08.358 --> 27:10.142
You rented a car
in Montreal

27:10.230 --> 27:11.928
and you left
right away.

27:12.052 --> 27:13.282
Yeah.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.587
Everybody wanted
to go, see the leaves changing.

27:16.744 --> 27:18.142
Did you stop
along the way?

27:18.230 --> 27:19.623
Yeah, lots of times.

27:19.711 --> 27:22.040
Everybody had to get out
and take pictures.

27:22.507 --> 27:25.423
Well, where did you
stop for lunch?

27:25.730 --> 27:28.775
A little mom and pop
type place off by itself.

27:30.178 --> 27:33.743
Now picture the man your wife
talked to at the hospital.

27:34.214 --> 27:35.603
Is he there?

27:36.544 --> 27:37.762
Could have been
an employee

27:37.850 --> 27:39.884
or someone else who
was having lunch.

27:42.493 --> 27:44.321
No. Uh-uh.

27:45.668 --> 27:48.384
All right, um,
after lunch,

27:48.721 --> 27:51.665
then what, you drove
back to return the car?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.767
Yes, I was nervous
we'd be late

27:53.855 --> 27:55.596
getting back to
the cruise ship.

27:58.831 --> 28:03.087
Were you feeling anxious
about that during lunch?

28:03.925 --> 28:05.220
No.

28:05.681 --> 28:08.197
Then what happened to
make you start worrying?

28:09.380 --> 28:11.072
I don't know. Uh...

28:11.968 --> 28:13.405
Wait, I remember now.

28:13.523 --> 28:16.001
This other guy
that was with us,

28:16.245 --> 28:20.466
we were practically
back to Montreal,

28:20.607 --> 28:23.587
maybe 10 minutes away, uh,

28:24.052 --> 28:26.533
he made us stop and take
another picture.

28:26.745 --> 28:29.829
Other guy, as in
Colin ainsworth?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.006
Yeah, I guess that
was his name, yeah.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.059
What did Colin want
to take a picture of?

28:35.380 --> 28:38.794
It was... it was
just this house.

28:39.366 --> 28:41.318
There was tape around it.

28:41.630 --> 28:43.130
Tape?
Yeah.

28:43.218 --> 28:45.208
You mean police tape?

28:46.027 --> 28:48.508
Yeah. I didn't pay
that much attention,

28:48.596 --> 28:50.697
but this guy,
this Colin, he...

28:51.182 --> 28:53.205
He said the place
was famous.

28:57.248 --> 28:59.049
Let's take a little
break, Fred.

29:03.989 --> 29:06.065
You're right, they would have
gone right past manner street.

29:06.152 --> 29:07.838
That has to be it.
I don't understand.

29:07.926 --> 29:08.932
What's manner street?

29:09.020 --> 29:11.006
A couple of months ago
Canadian police

29:11.094 --> 29:14.080
found 8 bodies in the
basement of a house there.

29:14.401 --> 29:15.518
Murdered?

29:15.877 --> 29:16.916
Poisoned.

29:17.052 --> 29:18.662
The homeowner rented
a spare room

29:18.797 --> 29:21.286
to pensioners and
people on disability,

29:21.374 --> 29:23.464
killed them, and kept cashing
their government checks.

29:23.551 --> 29:24.552
What happened to the guy?

29:24.640 --> 29:25.966
When the police
zeroed in,

29:26.054 --> 29:27.614
he blew himself up
in front of his house

29:27.702 --> 29:29.044
using a homemade
explosive.

29:29.252 --> 29:31.036
Garcia's on it.
We need to find out

29:31.124 --> 29:33.213
everything about the people
connected to that case...

29:33.388 --> 29:35.560
The killer, victims,
friends, and family.

29:35.939 --> 29:38.005
Let's see if I can
get some more from Fred.

29:41.555 --> 29:43.239
Ok.

29:44.042 --> 29:46.013
Let's get back
to the house.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.310
Yes?

29:50.801 --> 29:52.239
This is she.

29:53.327 --> 29:54.851
Well, they told me
I needed to stay here

29:54.938 --> 29:56.442
at the police department.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.270
All right, Dr. Delaney.
I understand.

30:00.622 --> 30:02.145
I'm on my way.

30:06.156 --> 30:07.739
He didn't say anything.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.786
All he wanted was
his damn picture.

30:09.932 --> 30:12.130
He had a regular camera,

30:12.221 --> 30:14.716
not one of those...
Those phone things,

30:14.897 --> 30:16.638
so he needed one of us
to take it.

30:16.974 --> 30:18.239
Thank you.

30:18.477 --> 30:19.645
This is so cool.

30:19.733 --> 30:21.039
Ok.
Yeah.

30:21.127 --> 30:22.215
Laura said she'd do it.

30:22.461 --> 30:23.549
Ok.

30:23.705 --> 30:25.881
Your wife took
a picture of Colin?

30:25.969 --> 30:27.119
Yeah.

30:27.241 --> 30:29.244
Damn near broke
her ankle doing it, too.

30:29.432 --> 30:30.433
How?

30:30.559 --> 30:33.088
The lawn was all
overgrown,

30:33.176 --> 30:34.900
and she tripped over
a clump of grass.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.135
You all right?

30:36.222 --> 30:37.361
Yeah.

30:38.478 --> 30:40.874
Now, this is very
important, Mr. Kirkman.

30:40.962 --> 30:42.837
I want you think
very hard.

30:43.416 --> 30:45.611
Was there anybody
else there?

30:47.452 --> 30:49.410
Wait. Wait,
there was somebody,

30:49.637 --> 30:50.869
off by himself,

30:51.408 --> 30:52.587
on the other side
of the yard,

30:52.675 --> 30:54.242
standing next to a car.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.345
He was staring over
towards Laura.

30:56.433 --> 30:58.916
Towards
Laura or at Laura?

30:59.027 --> 31:01.378
Not right at her.
He was staring down,

31:01.466 --> 31:02.597
like where she was walking.

31:02.685 --> 31:03.773
Where she tripped?

31:03.944 --> 31:06.056
Yes, where she stomped
on the...

31:06.144 --> 31:07.842
It was a bouquet of flowers.

31:07.993 --> 31:10.082
Mr. Kirkman, what was
your wife wearing that day?

31:10.170 --> 31:11.824
Wearing? Um...

31:15.312 --> 31:16.580
A yellow dress.

31:16.668 --> 31:20.421
Rhonda and Sophia were
never the ultimate targets.

31:20.509 --> 31:22.017
He's after Laura.

31:22.989 --> 31:25.322
Where's Mrs. Kirkman?

32:02.420 --> 32:04.249
Mrs. Kirkman was supposed
to be in police custody.

32:04.336 --> 32:05.397
What the hell happened?

32:05.485 --> 32:07.249
Miscommunication
during shift change.

32:07.337 --> 32:09.828
So apparently the unsub
posed as a doctor

32:09.916 --> 32:11.399
to lure her out,
said she needed to sign

32:11.486 --> 32:13.065
some forms at the hospital.

32:13.152 --> 32:14.414
What is it, Garcia?

32:14.502 --> 32:16.765
I think I got the who,
but I don't have the where.

32:16.853 --> 32:18.414
I looked into
everybody involved

32:18.502 --> 32:20.281
in the manner street murders,

32:20.369 --> 32:21.849
and nothing interesting
has come up

32:21.936 --> 32:25.287
until I got to
the final victim,

32:25.374 --> 32:26.798
Sally baker.

32:26.997 --> 32:29.056
What's interesting about
her is she's a total blank.

32:29.161 --> 32:31.712
Why is she a blank?
Turns out Sally baker's not her name,

32:31.800 --> 32:33.193
but Audrey Mattson.

32:33.347 --> 32:35.478
An assumed name?
Why, was she in trouble?

32:35.566 --> 32:37.003
Eh, more like
getting out of trouble.

32:37.090 --> 32:39.440
30 years ago she falls in love
with this guy, Karl Blair.

32:39.528 --> 32:42.531
Karl is a total drunk,
he's an abusive stalker.

32:42.636 --> 32:43.869
She tries to get
away from him,

32:43.957 --> 32:45.659
the system fails her,
so she has to change her name,

32:45.746 --> 32:47.416
go underground,
move up to Canada.

32:47.504 --> 32:49.738
Karl Blair profiles too old
to be our unsub, though.

32:49.926 --> 32:53.103
But their 26-year-old
son Shelby does not.

32:53.276 --> 32:55.539
According to child services,
he did everything he could

32:55.627 --> 32:56.886
to try to protect his mom,

32:56.974 --> 32:58.073
but unfortunately,
he inherited

32:58.160 --> 32:59.355
his
father's violent nature

32:59.443 --> 33:01.271
and he's been in
and out of jail.

33:01.509 --> 33:03.793
Here is his most
current mug shot.

33:04.300 --> 33:05.973
And we don't
have Shelby's address?

33:06.060 --> 33:08.574
No, that's the only thing
I haven't been able to figure.

33:08.676 --> 33:10.088
He was born in Texas,
but he's been a drifter

33:10.175 --> 33:11.957
- his whole life.
- Ok, thanks, Garcia.

33:12.045 --> 33:13.668
The mother he adored
and tried to protect

33:13.756 --> 33:15.583
- ended up murdered anyway.
- He must have brought the flowers

33:15.670 --> 33:16.691
to commemorate
the spot.

33:16.779 --> 33:18.155
Only to find a group
of lookie-loos

33:18.243 --> 33:20.418
using the tragedy as
a backdrop to a photo op,

33:20.506 --> 33:22.645
trampled his flowers,
and continued on their merry way.

33:22.732 --> 33:24.136
So he found out
who they were

33:24.224 --> 33:26.444
and decided to give them
a dose of the same pain.

33:30.386 --> 33:31.629
This is agent Prentiss.

33:31.717 --> 33:33.215
I need to speak with
the security detail

33:33.302 --> 33:35.191
at the Kirkman
crime scene ASAP.

33:37.219 --> 33:38.300
What is it?

33:38.388 --> 33:39.607
They've been trying
to contact the officer

33:39.694 --> 33:41.286
guarding the crime scene
for the past 10 minutes.

33:41.373 --> 33:42.635
He isn't responding.

33:48.277 --> 33:50.714
Please don't do this.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.433
Have you ever
been to New Orleans?

33:52.723 --> 33:54.027
Listen to me.

33:54.262 --> 33:55.495
Well, when I was a kid, I lived there

33:55.582 --> 33:56.566
with my mom
for a little bit,

33:56.654 --> 33:59.221
like it was right after Katrina,
like right after.

33:59.309 --> 34:01.573
I mean, this place was
like you can't even imagine.

34:01.661 --> 34:04.902
And, uh, she worked
in one of those fancy hotels,

34:04.990 --> 34:09.516
and her job was
to pack the lunches

34:09.605 --> 34:11.476
for the hotel's
disaster tours.

34:11.594 --> 34:13.495
- What... what are you talking about?
- Seriously. I mean,

34:13.581 --> 34:14.871
they didn't call them that,

34:14.958 --> 34:16.222
but that's what
they were, you know.

34:16.309 --> 34:19.706
You pile in a minibus,
and you go gawk.

34:20.272 --> 34:23.667
Bourbon street, check.
Garden district, check.

34:23.799 --> 34:25.956
Its human misery,
double check.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.835
- Please!
- These lunches, they were gourmet.

34:29.043 --> 34:31.306
You know, they even had
little chardonnay bottles,

34:31.395 --> 34:34.136
you know, something nice to sip
on down there in the lower ninth.

34:34.224 --> 34:39.491
Hey, look, that's where
so and so drowned like a rat,

34:39.739 --> 34:41.987
next to the old lady
who starved to death!

34:42.076 --> 34:44.018
I don't know who you
think you're talking to,

34:44.107 --> 34:45.804
but you have
the wrong person.

34:45.893 --> 34:47.214
No.

34:48.333 --> 34:49.878
I have the right person.

34:50.494 --> 34:52.364
But the sad thing is
that I could get

34:52.453 --> 34:54.020
pretty much any person
off the street

34:54.108 --> 34:56.206
and I'd kind of have
the right person,

34:56.971 --> 34:58.464
because people are
all the same.

34:58.885 --> 35:00.246
Everybody loves bad stuff

35:00.334 --> 35:01.785
when it happens
to someone else.

35:01.983 --> 35:03.724
It's like when there's
a car crash

35:03.851 --> 35:06.574
and everyone's got to stop
and rubberneck.

35:08.928 --> 35:11.253
You know, my mom said
that, um,

35:12.977 --> 35:14.691
making those lunches

35:15.240 --> 35:18.691
is the most shameful thing
she ever had to do.

35:18.854 --> 35:20.856
What are you gonna do?

35:20.950 --> 35:22.308
Take a photo

35:22.446 --> 35:24.144
and scrapbook of my own.

35:24.975 --> 35:26.300
No!

35:26.665 --> 35:28.972
No.

35:31.623 --> 35:32.537
No.

35:32.679 --> 35:34.376
Shelby Mattson,
FBI.

35:34.503 --> 35:36.111
Hands in the air now!

35:36.277 --> 35:38.122
You come any closer and I'm
gonna release this trigger.

35:38.209 --> 35:40.199
Don't do it.

35:40.608 --> 35:41.696
I release this,

35:41.784 --> 35:44.066
none of us are going
anywhere ever again.

35:48.868 --> 35:50.363
I swear to God!

35:51.256 --> 35:52.649
Go ahead.

35:53.727 --> 35:55.076
What?

35:55.249 --> 35:56.628
Go ahead.

36:12.959 --> 36:14.527
Need an ambulance now.

36:14.657 --> 36:15.657
You ok?

36:15.838 --> 36:17.332
Yeah, I'm good.

36:42.306 --> 36:44.199
Rhonda's also
out of surgery.

36:44.311 --> 36:46.761
Doctor says they're
both gonna be ok.

36:46.848 --> 36:48.855
That's really
great news.

36:49.810 --> 36:52.933
So how did you know
Mattson was bluffing?

36:53.098 --> 36:54.129
I wondered the same thing.

36:54.216 --> 36:55.333
What if the device
he was holding

36:55.420 --> 36:56.595
had been the actual
detonator.

36:56.683 --> 36:58.582
"Fun and games to follow."

36:59.043 --> 37:01.988
Shelby Mattson wasn't suicidal,
he was on a mission.

37:02.076 --> 37:03.566
And if we hadn't shown up,

37:03.654 --> 37:06.613
it wasn't gonna end in
Rhonda Kirkman's front yard.

37:07.087 --> 37:08.589
<i>Me, too, grandma.</i>

37:08.693 --> 37:10.449
<i>I love you more.</i>

37:15.072 --> 37:16.417
Dad?

37:17.316 --> 37:18.402
Hey.

37:18.567 --> 37:19.960
What's up?

37:26.513 --> 37:28.298
Is mom gonna be ok?

37:29.961 --> 37:31.535
Your mom's gonna be fine.

37:32.303 --> 37:35.683
She's just getting strong
for when your new

37:35.771 --> 37:37.214
brother or sister
shows up.

37:40.486 --> 37:44.136
You really couldn't see the
numbers on the dice, could you?

37:49.959 --> 37:51.332
No.

37:51.420 --> 37:52.682
I couldn't.

37:53.602 --> 37:55.753
That'll be our
little secret, ok?

37:57.439 --> 38:00.105
But, hey, it was fun
anyway, wasn't it?

38:00.193 --> 38:01.315
- Yeah.
- Right?

38:01.403 --> 38:03.332
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was.

38:03.435 --> 38:05.480
Yeah.

38:06.817 --> 38:08.347
I am being summoned.

38:11.487 --> 38:12.917
Hey, hey.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.191
I love you.

38:19.552 --> 38:20.894
I love you, too.

38:20.982 --> 38:22.505
Ok.

38:35.222 --> 38:36.966
I could get used to this.

38:38.519 --> 38:40.013
Emily called
from the jet,

38:40.101 --> 38:41.544
and the little girl
I told you about

38:41.632 --> 38:42.720
is going to be ok.

38:42.925 --> 38:44.544
- Aw.
- And her mom, too.

38:44.662 --> 38:45.825
That's wonderful news.

38:45.913 --> 38:47.099
Yeah.

38:47.413 --> 38:48.849
Nice music.

38:49.209 --> 38:50.693
Mm-hmm.

38:51.081 --> 38:54.044
Before bed Lily
asked me what opera was,

38:54.306 --> 38:56.794
so I told her
the whole story.

38:57.544 --> 38:58.654
Of madame butterfly?

38:58.742 --> 38:59.966
Mm-hmm.

39:00.558 --> 39:03.953
How an American sailor came to
Japan and they fell in love,

39:04.329 --> 39:06.157
they had a baby,
but back in those days,

39:06.260 --> 39:09.920
it was hard for the two
cultures to come together.

39:11.264 --> 39:13.029
And did Lily understand?

39:13.117 --> 39:14.631
- I don't think so.
- Mm-mmm.

39:15.213 --> 39:16.693
Because at the end
of the story,

39:16.781 --> 39:20.639
she asked me if the
American sailor was popeye.

39:22.242 --> 39:24.883
Oh, don't do that,
you'll make my water break.

39:25.344 --> 39:26.523
I can't...

39:27.100 --> 39:29.015
I was just
out there thinking

39:29.341 --> 39:31.812
about how much trust
our children have in us.

39:32.322 --> 39:34.572
And how at the age
they are now,

39:35.906 --> 39:38.040
their lives are
totally in our hands.

39:39.729 --> 39:41.415
What prompted that?

39:41.844 --> 39:44.751
A pair of dice
without any dots.

39:46.276 --> 39:47.756
I'll tell you
about it later.

39:50.886 --> 39:55.064
Well, I've been doing
some thinking of my own.

39:56.554 --> 39:58.087
After this one,

39:58.382 --> 40:01.342
what do you say
we call it a day,

40:01.523 --> 40:02.892
kid-making-wise?

40:04.510 --> 40:06.564
5 is a nice round number.

40:06.993 --> 40:07.994
Hmm?

40:08.082 --> 40:10.519
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

40:10.864 --> 40:12.168
I'll drink to that.

40:12.924 --> 40:13.968
Ahh.
