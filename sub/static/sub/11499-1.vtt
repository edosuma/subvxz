Captioning made possible by
Disney channel and the
U.S. department of education

00:06.923 --> 00:09.224
most of the time
when you think history,

00:09.259 --> 00:10.893
you think boring, right?

00:10.927 --> 00:12.428
Ancient civilizations

00:12.462 --> 00:15.130
with names you can't pronounce,
dates, facts...

00:15.165 --> 00:16.398
I mean, who cares?

00:16.433 --> 00:20.969
But sometimes, history can slam
right into the present

00:21.004 --> 00:22.938
and totally blow your mind.

00:32.749 --> 00:34.717
The first ever
movie theater in our town

00:34.751 --> 00:37.119
opened in 1925.

00:37.153 --> 00:40.589
<i>Phantom of the</i> opera
was its first film.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.459
But times changed.
Things progressed,

00:43.493 --> 00:47.129
and the old movie theater
bit the dust.

00:47.163 --> 00:48.397
Literally.

00:48.431 --> 00:51.700
There was a rumor
that one faithful,
old moviegoer

00:51.735 --> 00:53.669
got trapped inside
when it went down.

00:53.703 --> 00:57.506
Some folks even claimed
he survived.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.208
Yeah, right.

01:02.378 --> 01:04.780
Anyway, a new theater was built

01:04.813 --> 01:06.381
and new movies were shown

01:06.416 --> 01:08.450
and all the while,
the legend grew.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.019
Now here I am, 17,
working at the theater,

01:11.054 --> 01:13.021
and we still talk about the guy.

01:13.056 --> 01:15.758
Every time a piece
of film breaks
or the lights flicker,

01:15.792 --> 01:17.526
we have someone to blame.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.661
Not that I believe
in any phantom.

01:19.696 --> 01:22.431
Truth is, I've got more
important things on my mind.

01:22.465 --> 01:24.233
That's me. Pete Riley.

01:24.267 --> 01:26.268
My mom thinks
i work way too hard,

01:26.302 --> 01:28.036
but she really doesn't get it.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.104
Do the counts?
Yeah.

01:29.139 --> 01:30.706
I'm the youngest
assistant manager

01:30.740 --> 01:33.342
they've ever had
at this 26-screen megaplex.

01:33.376 --> 01:37.613
Hey, we're talking some serious
responsibility here, right?

01:37.647 --> 01:39.915
Do you know
on a typical Saturday night

01:39.949 --> 01:41.316
we have 52 people working,

01:41.351 --> 01:43.752
sell 88 pounds of popcorn,

01:43.787 --> 01:47.156
move 7,000 patrons in and out,
and have 63 showings

01:47.190 --> 01:50.392
with an average
of 4-6 minor
technical glitches?

01:50.426 --> 01:54.296
Whew! That's a lot
to keep track of. Trust me.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.068
That's our senior manager,
Shawn macgibbon.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.304
He's freaking out
because our theater owner,

02:02.338 --> 02:05.741
and Shawn's personal idol,
Wolfgang nedermeyer,

02:05.775 --> 02:08.710
scored like
the coup of the century.

02:08.745 --> 02:10.078
See, a movie called
<i>midnight mayhem</i>

02:10.113 --> 02:11.847
filmed not too far from here,
last spring...

02:11.881 --> 02:13.849
Nedermeyer used his connections

02:13.883 --> 02:16.318
to talk the filmmakers
into coming back,

02:16.352 --> 02:18.821
right here to our own
grand megaplex,

02:18.855 --> 02:21.890
for the big-time
Hollywood-style world premiere.

02:21.925 --> 02:23.458
Ok. Stop. Stop.

02:23.493 --> 02:24.726
We're going to need one of us

02:24.761 --> 02:26.395
on either side and one in back,

02:26.429 --> 02:27.529
or someone's going to end up

02:27.564 --> 02:29.331
with a major hernia, ok?

02:29.365 --> 02:30.432
That's Ricky leary...

02:30.466 --> 02:32.467
Or as we call him, Ricky rules.

02:32.502 --> 02:33.602
No matter what you're doing,

02:33.636 --> 02:35.337
Ricky's got
the procedure for it.

02:35.371 --> 02:37.206
You know, once I heard

02:37.240 --> 02:39.741
these kids were trying
to push something like this,

02:39.776 --> 02:42.811
and it started rolling backwards
and it crushed them,

02:42.846 --> 02:45.147
and one kid got killed,
and the other ones lost

02:45.181 --> 02:47.049
a bunch of fingers,
toes, and junk.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.183
That's Terri tortora...

02:48.218 --> 02:50.452
Nicknamed scary Terri.

02:50.486 --> 02:52.321
She's got a hundred
stories to tell,

02:52.355 --> 02:54.923
and all of them
end in death
and destruction.

02:54.958 --> 02:55.924
All right.
Great, you guys.

02:55.959 --> 02:57.993
Now, um, go straighten up
the snack bar.

02:58.027 --> 03:01.363
This is fantastic.
Look what a great job
we're doing, honey.

03:01.397 --> 03:02.865
Aren't we so efficient?

03:02.899 --> 03:03.866
Hillary horan...

03:03.900 --> 03:06.134
A.K.A. Hillary honey.

03:06.169 --> 03:08.103
She's like your grandma
in a teenage body.

03:08.137 --> 03:10.339
Calls everybody
sweetie and baby.

03:10.373 --> 03:12.341
Always wants to make sure
we're eating enough,

03:12.375 --> 03:13.675
wearing warm enough clothes.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.977
Hey, mark
could you please
sweep down

03:15.011 --> 03:15.978
the carpet for me?

03:16.012 --> 03:17.012
With a broom, you mean?

03:17.046 --> 03:18.180
Mark jefferies...

03:18.214 --> 03:20.916
Or as I call him, question mark.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.251
You can't say anything to him

03:22.285 --> 03:24.586
without getting
a hundred questions
in response.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.054
Yeah, with the broom.

03:32.428 --> 03:33.896
I straightened up
the ticket booth,

03:33.930 --> 03:35.163
cleaned both ladies' rooms,

03:35.198 --> 03:36.865
washed the popcorn maker,
and swept inside the elevator.

03:36.900 --> 03:37.833
Now i...

03:37.867 --> 03:40.569
Lacy ling a.K.A.
Racy Lacy.

03:40.603 --> 03:42.738
Why walk if you can run?

03:42.772 --> 03:44.139
You know what you can do for me?

03:44.173 --> 03:45.107
Head upstairs,

03:45.141 --> 03:46.541
make sure that the trash cans

03:46.576 --> 03:48.076
have been emptied,
and then check
to see

03:48.111 --> 03:49.745
if that, um,
wind machine
arrived

03:49.779 --> 03:51.613
for our Hollywood display.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.251
Read the presentation criteria
checklist on my booth wall,

03:56.286 --> 03:59.087
and, uh, you'd know that
digital soundtrack
mis-threading

03:59.122 --> 04:02.691
is the number one cause
for, uh, customer grievances.

04:02.725 --> 04:05.460
That guy? He's our
head projectionist, merle.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.963
Ask a simple question,
get a way too complicated

04:07.997 --> 04:10.399
technospeak answer in return.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.436
Ahem.

04:15.972 --> 04:17.773
Slow it down, my dear.

04:17.807 --> 04:21.642
Every moment should be savored.

04:25.148 --> 04:26.114
Meet movie Mason.

04:26.149 --> 04:27.616
He doesn't work here.

04:27.650 --> 04:29.685
He just thinks he does.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.620
It was Mason's family who opened

04:31.654 --> 04:34.623
the original theater
on this spot
in the 1920s.

04:34.657 --> 04:37.359
Mason loves movies
more than anything.

04:37.393 --> 04:40.195
When they tore his place down
to build the megaplex,

04:40.229 --> 04:42.965
he had a hard time letting go.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.866
My schedule.

04:44.901 --> 04:49.371
So, each week
Mason types up
his work schedule,

04:49.405 --> 04:53.608
and each week Shawn files it.

04:53.643 --> 04:56.445
Still, Mason shows up every day,

04:56.479 --> 04:58.413
and we're always happy
to see him.

04:58.448 --> 05:02.417
Anyway, it's not
only the premiere
I'm pumped about.

05:02.452 --> 05:05.554
See there's this girl,
Caitlin kerigan,

05:05.588 --> 05:07.556
and I got her
and her friend Lisa

05:07.590 --> 05:09.591
passes to an early movie
into the premiere.

05:09.625 --> 05:10.726
Not bad, huh?

05:10.760 --> 05:12.627
Now you get why tonight

05:12.662 --> 05:17.199
everything
has to be totally,
100% perfect.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.333
Aah!
Whoa!

05:32.348 --> 05:34.983
I cannot stress enough, people,

05:35.018 --> 05:38.120
that on a night
as monumental
as this one

05:38.154 --> 05:42.657
careers are going to be made
and careers will be broken.

05:42.692 --> 05:46.294
Tonight, as the eyes of
the entertainment world

05:46.329 --> 05:48.230
fall upon our humble megaplex,

05:48.264 --> 05:50.966
what I want them
to see is greatness:

05:51.000 --> 05:53.335
Greatness that can
only come from you kids

05:53.369 --> 05:58.573
and the rest of my crack
Saturday night team.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.875
To quote Mr. nedermeyer,

05:59.909 --> 06:01.977
"it is service
that can't be beat

06:02.011 --> 06:04.112
that puts a butt
in every seat."

06:04.147 --> 06:05.914
I expect to see
the straightest bow ties,

06:05.948 --> 06:08.150
the neatest vests,
the most polished shoes...

06:08.184 --> 06:09.785
Whoa. Shawn,
are you sure?

06:09.819 --> 06:12.421
Because
once I heard these kids
with really shiny shoes...

06:12.455 --> 06:14.156
No, no, no.
Shusha, shusha.

06:14.190 --> 06:17.559
Terri,
rise to my level,
or be gone.

06:17.593 --> 06:19.895
For those of you who <i> do</i> wish to

06:19.929 --> 06:24.766
I expect
to see you back here
promptly at 3:00

06:24.801 --> 06:26.401
to start your shifts.

06:26.436 --> 06:28.003
3:00 today, you mean?

06:28.037 --> 06:31.106
No, mark. 3:00
a year from Tuesday.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.607
Ahem.

06:36.879 --> 06:37.846
Yes.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.382
Ahh, Mr. nedermeyer.

06:40.416 --> 06:41.516
You did?

06:44.220 --> 06:45.320
I see.

06:46.422 --> 06:47.589
No, no.

06:47.623 --> 06:50.225
If you feel
that your son-in-law
is the best man

06:50.259 --> 06:51.526
for the general manager's job,

06:51.561 --> 06:55.197
that's a decision
i will have
to respect.

06:56.432 --> 06:59.101
Of course, sir.
We'll see you
both, tonight.

07:10.313 --> 07:13.281
We are professionals.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.283
Ahem.

07:16.652 --> 07:19.454
And we will act like...

07:20.857 --> 07:22.257
Professionals.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.227
Um, on a... on
all shows

07:25.261 --> 07:26.795
before the premiere
this evening,

07:26.829 --> 07:28.463
we will get the customers in,

07:28.498 --> 07:30.832
get them out,
but always be kind
and courteous.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.436
In the words
of Mr. nedermeyer,

07:34.470 --> 07:36.972
"a smile
at every door..."

07:39.442 --> 07:41.109
"Keeps them coming back
for more."

07:41.144 --> 07:43.879
Yes. Yes.

07:43.946 --> 07:46.214
You're a good man, Pete.

07:47.416 --> 07:49.584
You might
go places in this
organization.

07:49.619 --> 07:51.052
And since
Mr. nedermeyer
expects

07:51.087 --> 07:52.154
the impossible this evening,

07:52.188 --> 07:53.955
if anything does go wrong,

07:53.990 --> 07:55.824
I'm fully prepared to blame you.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.960
Dismissed!

08:23.052 --> 08:24.486
You always do this to me.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.087
You tell me
you want me
to have a life,

08:26.122 --> 08:27.622
so and then
i make plans
with my friends,

08:27.657 --> 08:28.823
and then suddenly,
at the last second,

08:28.858 --> 08:30.192
you say you need me
to baby-sit.

08:30.226 --> 08:31.526
I told you last Monday

08:31.561 --> 08:32.527
I needed you for tonight.

08:32.562 --> 08:34.062
Was I listening?

08:34.096 --> 08:35.197
Are you ever?

08:35.231 --> 08:36.631
What's up?

08:36.666 --> 08:38.799
Mom's going out
with George tonight.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.802
Ahh! Think he might
finally propose?

08:40.836 --> 08:43.205
Why do you guys
keep pushing
this?

08:43.239 --> 08:44.406
You and George
are great together.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.674
You're always happy
when he's around.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.075
Oh, yeah.
You know what
you should do?

08:47.109 --> 08:48.076
You should be like
gillie Blake in

08:48.110 --> 08:49.311
<i>always a bridesmaid.</i>

08:49.345 --> 08:50.645
Tell him how great
you look in white,

08:50.680 --> 08:53.481
ask him if he wants
to play old maid,

08:53.516 --> 08:55.650
and then tell him
you'll give him a ring

08:55.685 --> 08:56.885
when you get home.

08:58.387 --> 09:00.388
Does every reference
in your life have to be
from a movie?

09:00.423 --> 09:02.057
Why shouldn't it be?

09:02.091 --> 09:04.626
You sound
exactly like
the grouchy old dad

09:04.660 --> 09:05.727
in <i> blank screen.</i>

09:05.761 --> 09:07.295
Yeah, well, I just think
it would be cool

09:07.330 --> 09:09.531
if every once in a while
you two lived in
the real world.

09:09.565 --> 09:11.066
Boring.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.368
Now about George...

09:13.402 --> 09:16.571
George will propose
if and when
he's ready.

09:16.606 --> 09:19.407
Yeah, but as Wendy Dillon
said in <i> maybe</i> baby,

09:19.442 --> 09:21.176
"until you apply the headlock...

09:21.210 --> 09:23.645
Sister and brother:
He might never comply
with wedlock."

09:26.616 --> 09:27.782
Mom, can Karen and I see

09:27.817 --> 09:29.684
<i>farmer brown</i>
<i>goes to town,</i>
tonight?

09:29.719 --> 09:31.820
Pete said it's not
going to be playing
much longer,

09:31.854 --> 09:33.588
and tomorrow
I've got baseball
practice all day...

09:33.623 --> 09:35.624
Why can't Pete
take him when he goes
to work, tonight?

09:35.691 --> 09:38.159
Then I can meet my friends
to see <i> university of death.</i>

09:38.194 --> 09:40.662
Oh, you're not seeing
that movie with
or without Brian.

09:40.696 --> 09:42.731
I don't like
those bloody,
sickening things.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.466
I'm not asking you to see it.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.401
Watch that tone.

09:46.435 --> 09:48.203
I hate my life!

09:48.237 --> 09:50.739
You still treat me
like I'm 3 years old.

09:50.773 --> 09:52.007
Oh, I do not.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.309
Now run in the house,
and I'll fix you
a bottle.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.544
I'm not laughing, mom.

09:56.579 --> 09:58.747
Well, start.
It helps.

10:05.621 --> 10:09.457
Ok. Final offer.
You and Brian
can go see <i> farmer brown,</i>

10:09.492 --> 10:11.393
Pete can drive you home
on his dinner break,

10:11.427 --> 10:13.395
and then you only
have to be on duty

10:13.429 --> 10:15.297
till I get home at midnight.

10:15.331 --> 10:16.598
Sounds sweet.

10:16.632 --> 10:18.033
To who?

10:18.067 --> 10:19.367
To whom.

10:19.402 --> 10:20.568
Tch!

10:20.603 --> 10:21.770
Take it or leave it, hon.

10:21.804 --> 10:22.937
And even if I didn't
have a date,

10:22.972 --> 10:24.873
I wouldn't let you see
<i>college of blood.</i>

10:24.907 --> 10:27.942
Mom, it's <i>university of death.</i>

10:27.977 --> 10:29.844
Yeah, well, same difference.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.746
Ugh!

10:46.962 --> 10:48.096
Slow down, grog.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.765
Nobody's
going to steal your
woolly mammoth meat.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.500
Hmm! I'm starving.

10:52.535 --> 10:53.468
Obviously.

10:53.502 --> 10:56.004
How did it go
down at the theater?

10:56.038 --> 10:58.540
Oh, it was so cool.
Me and Ricky we had to...

10:58.574 --> 10:59.808
Ricky and I.

10:59.842 --> 11:01.109
Ricky and I, we had to put

11:01.143 --> 11:04.112
this huge monster blow-up thing
above the main marquee.

11:04.146 --> 11:06.014
They had you up on the roof?

11:06.048 --> 11:08.383
Yeah, mom. And I fell off,
cracked my skull,

11:08.417 --> 11:09.484
and now I'm dead.

11:09.518 --> 11:12.187
Ha ha.
Just for the record,
i don't approve.

11:12.221 --> 11:15.223
Uh, ooh, listen.
I realize I should have
checked with you first,

11:15.257 --> 11:17.225
but would it be ok
for you to drive

11:17.259 --> 11:18.960
the littles home
on your break, tonight?

11:18.994 --> 11:21.162
They'll be long gone
before the start
of the premiere.

11:21.197 --> 11:23.965
That's not what
I'm worried about.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.367
Caitlin's coming by.

11:25.401 --> 11:28.036
I snagged her and a friend
passes for an earlier movie

11:28.070 --> 11:29.504
and then to stay
for the premiere.

11:29.538 --> 11:31.673
They won't bother you.
I'll make them promise.

11:31.707 --> 11:33.375
Oh, I just don't want
them coming up

11:33.409 --> 11:35.410
and making dumb comments
and stuff.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.712
Pete, you know
how those two are.

11:37.747 --> 11:39.147
Bombs could be
going off
when they're

11:39.181 --> 11:41.282
watching a movie,
and it wouldn't
distract them.

11:41.317 --> 11:43.218
Exactly like
your father
that way.

11:43.252 --> 11:46.321
Who loved the movies
more than dad?

11:47.723 --> 11:49.691
Yeah.

11:51.227 --> 11:53.461
Sometimes I wonder if that's why

11:53.496 --> 11:55.096
you ended up at the megaplex.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.067
Well, no disrespect, mom,
but I'm in it strictly
for the cold, hard cash.

11:59.101 --> 12:03.671
Uh, yeah. Um,
speaking of which,

12:03.706 --> 12:05.707
don't you think
you've been
putting in

12:05.741 --> 12:07.275
too many hours down there?

12:07.309 --> 12:11.079
We go over this every month.
The answer is still, no.

12:11.113 --> 12:12.046
I love my job.

12:12.081 --> 12:14.315
Yeah, but all work
and no play...

12:14.350 --> 12:15.984
Is going to make me
really, really rich.

12:16.018 --> 12:18.853
And burned out before you're 30.

12:18.888 --> 12:21.823
Pete, you're young.
You have plenty
of years to work.

12:21.857 --> 12:23.258
You should be out
enjoying yourself.

12:23.292 --> 12:28.463
Mom, don't worry
about it. I'm fine.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.597
Ok.

12:32.735 --> 12:35.703
Tonight sounds like
it's going to be
pretty great, though.

12:35.738 --> 12:38.139
Klieg lights,
limousines,
movie stars.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.942
Karen said
Sarah Joan Michelle
whatever,

12:40.976 --> 12:42.977
was going to be there.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.346
Madison Ashley Metz, mom.

12:45.381 --> 12:46.681
Isn't that what I said?

12:49.118 --> 12:50.985
No, really,
it sounds so
exciting.

12:51.020 --> 12:57.158
Are you nervous?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.861
It's a disaster.
Mom, we're pa total calamity.

12:59.895 --> 13:01.729
I am talking
fade out. The end.

13:01.764 --> 13:02.764
What's going on?

13:02.798 --> 13:05.033
Craig and Randy
just both
phoned in sick.

13:05.067 --> 13:08.069
And Jenna, well,
she's simply lost
in the ozone.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.338
How can nearly
half our staff
pick tonight,

13:10.372 --> 13:12.740
of all nights,
to simply
not show up?

13:12.775 --> 13:14.709
And nedermeyer
keeps calling
every 5 minutes

13:14.743 --> 13:15.910
to see how it's going.

13:15.945 --> 13:16.911
He keeps telling me
this premiere

13:16.946 --> 13:18.580
has to go off without a flaw.

13:18.614 --> 13:21.416
- Without a hitch.
- Without one single...

13:22.718 --> 13:24.519
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.120
You see, when I get nervous i...

13:26.155 --> 13:28.957
Go! Get me water
from the snack bar.

13:28.991 --> 13:30.692
Flat, no bubbles.
Go!

13:30.726 --> 13:31.826
Ok.

13:40.536 --> 13:41.636
Heard the latest?

13:41.670 --> 13:42.971
Since we're so understaffed,

13:43.005 --> 13:45.073
all breaks
and dinner hours
have been cancelled,

13:45.107 --> 13:48.142
which is <i> huge</i> violation
of our union contract.

13:48.177 --> 13:49.878
Ahem.
But I guess
tonight's

13:49.912 --> 13:50.879
not the night to get into

13:50.913 --> 13:52.347
Shawn's face about it.

13:52.381 --> 13:53.948
Good instincts, Ricky.

13:53.983 --> 13:57.252
I heard once, these kids
at this restaurant

13:57.286 --> 13:58.319
didn't get their dinner break,

13:58.354 --> 14:00.788
and they all started fainting.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.056
And then...

14:02.091 --> 14:04.759
Blood, guts, death,
destruction.
I mean, come on, Terri.

14:04.793 --> 14:06.861
Like we haven't heard it,
like, a thousand times.

14:06.896 --> 14:07.996
We're never
going to get
through this.

14:08.030 --> 14:09.597
Even if we didn't have
the premiere,

14:09.632 --> 14:11.366
this is way too much stu
for us to handle.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.333
Hey, tough up, rookies.

14:12.368 --> 14:15.103
To quote Shawn
quoting nedermeyer,

14:15.137 --> 14:16.771
"if you don't
want to get canned,

14:16.805 --> 14:18.640
give your very best
to the grand."

14:18.674 --> 14:20.675
Now make this bigger.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.377
Are you bringing that
to put up the net
for the balloon drop?

14:22.411 --> 14:25.179
Check it out.
Shawn's completely
3 steps ahead of you guys.

14:25.214 --> 14:28.116
Man, is he dedicated or what?

14:28.150 --> 14:30.385
Even though he didn't get
the general manager job,

14:30.419 --> 14:32.153
he's still hustling
like a maniac.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.828
Now listen.
We need to figure this out

14:40.863 --> 14:42.463
before my mom gets
out of the shower.

14:42.498 --> 14:45.300
So she's dropping
Brian and me off at 7:30
for a 7:4o <i> farmer brown.</i>

14:45.334 --> 14:47.936
So I need to do the 7:50
<i>university of</i> death

14:47.970 --> 14:49.504
so I can get Brian all settled,

14:49.538 --> 14:51.139
then can sit with you guys.

14:53.108 --> 14:54.642
I told her it was pg-13.

14:54.677 --> 14:55.677
But she's still all freaked out.

14:55.711 --> 14:57.245
Thinks it's going to be
too violent and...

14:57.279 --> 14:59.614
I... i totally agree.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.816
We see worse things
on the 6:00 news.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.651
Ok, perfect.

15:03.686 --> 15:07.055
So I'll see you guys,
outside, 7:50,
<i>university of death.</i>

15:07.089 --> 15:08.122
Ok, bye.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.624
<i>University of death?</i>

15:09.658 --> 15:12.594
You're supposed to see
<i>farmer brown</i> with me.

15:12.628 --> 15:13.628
Remember?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.396
Look. I'll get you in.
I'll get you settled.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.031
Yeah, right.
Then ditch me.

15:17.066 --> 15:18.866
Like you're going
to even notice.

15:18.901 --> 15:21.402
What if it turns into, like,
<i>Waldorf's</i> revenge?

15:21.437 --> 15:23.371
Where that, you know,
criminal guy runs into

15:23.405 --> 15:26.507
the theater and grabs
that innocent kid
hostage?

15:26.542 --> 15:27.842
That won't happen, Brian.

15:27.876 --> 15:29.410
Or... or what if
it's like in <i> flood?</i>

15:29.445 --> 15:31.579
And the whole place
starts to flood,
but I'm

15:32.715 --> 15:34.082
trapped?

15:34.116 --> 15:36.451
Or what if I pay you
5 bucks and take you to see

15:36.485 --> 15:39.454
power penguins foiling
big glory next weekend?

15:39.488 --> 15:42.056
10 bucks and 2 movies.

15:42.091 --> 15:46.394
10 bucks,<i> power penguins</i>,
and a large candy

15:46.428 --> 15:48.963
let me think about it.

15:48.998 --> 15:50.698
Hmm. Let me think about what?

15:50.733 --> 15:53.267
Ohh, uh. Whether he, um,

15:53.302 --> 15:57.005
whether he wants to
wash or dry the dishes.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.273
Mm-hmm.

16:03.312 --> 16:04.946
Movie Mason:
Good evening.
Enjoy the show.

16:04.980 --> 16:07.215
Enjoy the show, sir.
Enjoy the show.

16:07.249 --> 16:09.617
Uh, hello, mrs, Johnson.
I love your earrings.

16:09.652 --> 16:10.918
Hello, gentlemen.
How are you?

16:10.953 --> 16:13.521
Hey, movie Mason.
Rippin' tux.

16:17.192 --> 16:18.493
Uh, enjoy the show.

16:21.196 --> 16:22.296
Female employee: Next.

16:23.599 --> 16:24.565
Uhh, uhh!

16:24.600 --> 16:27.935
Oh, one more try.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.370
No.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.938
Next!

16:34.176 --> 16:35.176
May I have some nachos, please,

16:35.210 --> 16:36.644
with some extra cheese?

16:36.679 --> 16:38.246
Female customer: Can I get
a large soda, please?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.415
Ok, you've got enough
popcorn tubs, lids.

16:40.449 --> 16:41.716
Looks like all
you need now is cups.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.884
And straws, ok?

16:42.918 --> 16:45.053
Cups and straws.
Cups and straws.

16:46.855 --> 16:48.623
Lookin', sharp there, petey.

16:48.657 --> 16:51.192
What're you doing here, hollie?

16:51.226 --> 16:54.262
We heard Caitlin and Lisa
were going to be
around, tonight.

16:54.296 --> 16:56.698
What movie did you
give them passes for?

16:56.732 --> 16:58.166
I forget, ok?

16:58.200 --> 17:00.501
I'm busy.

17:01.904 --> 17:04.372
Why does that
dog make it
so easy

17:04.406 --> 17:06.773
for me to rattle his cage?

17:08.242 --> 17:11.846
My whole life
Donny hollie's been like
some dark shadow.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.015
In school, sports, girls.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.817
If I want it, he wants it.

17:15.851 --> 17:17.318
He's the one
who usually gets it.

17:17.352 --> 17:20.154
Well, does he know
that you like
Caitlin, hon?

17:20.189 --> 17:23.590
Think it's just
a coincidence
he showed up, tonight?

17:23.625 --> 17:24.992
Now I'll be working my buns off,

17:25.027 --> 17:27.662
he'll hunt her down,
pour on some of his
gross charm.

17:27.695 --> 17:30.064
I hate Donny.

17:30.099 --> 17:31.833
You know, never worked
a day in his life.

17:31.867 --> 17:34.268
All the girls think
he's just so good looking.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.270
He's has a totally perfect life.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.239
But you are so
way sweeter, doll.

17:39.775 --> 17:41.743
Since when does
that count for anything?

17:41.777 --> 17:45.413
You know, girls like Caitlin
want guys with decent cars,

17:45.447 --> 17:47.181
you know, money to spend
on dates.

17:47.216 --> 17:49.717
I'm earning cash
just to compete.

17:49.752 --> 17:51.219
Woman: This is
ridiculous!

17:51.253 --> 17:52.587
Second woman:
Hey, don't push.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.222
I understand it.

17:55.424 --> 17:57.091
Girl: This is taking
forever!

17:57.126 --> 17:58.226
Woman: Why?

17:58.260 --> 18:00.428
Hey, Zeke, what's the deal?

18:00.462 --> 18:01.829
Shouldn't Shawn open up
another line?

18:01.864 --> 18:03.164
There's nobody to man it, man.

18:03.198 --> 18:05.366
It's crazy!
Workin' my fingers
off here.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.501
Not tonight, man.

18:06.535 --> 18:07.802
Whoa, folks.
Settle down.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.271
Look, everybody's going
to make it inside,
all right?

18:10.305 --> 18:11.906
Eventually.

18:12.941 --> 18:15.176
Young Shawn,
when can I expect you

18:15.210 --> 18:18.012
to respond to my proposal
about putting a live organ...

18:18.046 --> 18:19.714
Not now, Mason.
I'm swamped, ok?

18:19.748 --> 18:21.015
How's it going, men?

18:21.049 --> 18:23.384
You've got to get us
some help, boss.
This is weak.

18:23.418 --> 18:24.652
Am I Houdini?

18:24.686 --> 18:26.220
Am I supposed to
pull an employee
out of my hat?

18:26.255 --> 18:27.655
Relax, young Shawn.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.991
I would gladly abandon
my greater post

18:30.025 --> 18:31.993
to answer the desperate
call to arms

18:32.027 --> 18:34.395
to become a ticket taker.

18:34.429 --> 18:35.963
There's only one problem, Mason.

18:35.998 --> 18:37.698
You don't work here. Ok?

18:37.733 --> 18:39.000
Now you tell him.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.536
A man in crisis
should not be burdened

18:41.570 --> 18:43.171
by irrelevant details.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.540
So you'd stand here
and take tickets

18:45.574 --> 18:47.441
even if I can't pay you?

18:48.710 --> 18:52.580
Shawn, movies are not
about commerce, my friend.

18:52.614 --> 18:54.348
Movies are about magic.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.118
Is that a yes or a no?

18:57.152 --> 19:00.154
Hey, if he wants
to do it, Shawn,
let him.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.335
Not since I was made head Usher

19:14.369 --> 19:17.438
at the Saul and gettle
sand palace of burlesque

19:17.472 --> 19:20.408
has my heart been filled
with such pride.

19:20.442 --> 19:22.810
In the name of the great
Cecil b. De Mille,

19:22.845 --> 19:24.812
I will not let you down.

19:24.847 --> 19:28.382
Whatever. Just stand there,
hand half the ticket back,

19:28.417 --> 19:29.717
and keep the people moving.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.819
Watch him.

19:33.689 --> 19:37.425
Oh, nedermeyer will not
be happy until I have
a nervous breakdown.

19:37.459 --> 19:38.693
Hey, Mason.

19:38.727 --> 19:40.795
Hello, son.
Enjoy the show.

19:40.829 --> 19:43.064
Oh, I take this.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.198
Thank you.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.633
Here, this is the other half.

19:46.735 --> 19:48.669
Make sure Pete
knows you're here.

19:48.704 --> 19:50.037
Don't leave
the theater
without him,

19:50.072 --> 19:51.539
and don't talk to strangers.

19:51.573 --> 19:53.241
You have money
and my pager number,
right?

19:53.275 --> 19:54.375
Mom, we're going to see a movie,

19:54.409 --> 19:56.210
not crossing the Atlantic
in a canoe.

19:56.245 --> 19:58.045
George: Trust them,
pocahontas.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.513
Hey, they've got this wired.

19:59.548 --> 20:01.382
See, look! George gets it!

20:01.416 --> 20:03.751
Besides, mom,
it's not even dark yet.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.553
Plus, since they hired
those cinema sitters,

20:05.587 --> 20:07.054
we couldn't get
away with anything

20:07.089 --> 20:08.689
even if we wanted to.

20:08.724 --> 20:10.591
Well, good.
Love you guys.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.693
Love you, too.

20:12.728 --> 20:15.396
Remember, no headlock,
no wedlock.

20:15.430 --> 20:17.832
Go on! Get out of here!

20:17.866 --> 20:19.500
And no <i> corpse school!</i>

20:19.534 --> 20:22.737
I'm guessing she
means <i> university</i>
<i>of death.</i>

20:22.771 --> 20:25.907
George: So, what
was that all about?

20:25.941 --> 20:28.409
Nothing. They are
genuinely crazy
about you, George,

20:28.443 --> 20:31.145
and you have
no idea how flattered
you should be.

20:33.849 --> 20:35.783
First female:
What's the hold-up?
What's going on?

20:35.817 --> 20:36.817
First male:
What's the hold-up?

20:36.852 --> 20:37.752
Second male: Any night!

20:37.786 --> 20:38.920
Third male: Let's go!
Let's go!

20:38.954 --> 20:40.955
Go see why
we're not moving, bri.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.290
I'll hold our place.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.058
Ok.

20:44.092 --> 20:45.126
Fourth male:
Hey, is that kid
cutting in line?

20:45.160 --> 20:46.093
Fifth male: Man!

20:46.128 --> 20:48.963
Second female:
I need some air.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.398
Sixth male: Hurry up!

20:50.432 --> 20:52.466
Third female:
Come on!
What's the hold-up?

20:52.501 --> 20:53.434
Mason: I'm sorry.

20:53.468 --> 20:54.435
We appreciate your opinion, guy.

20:54.469 --> 20:55.736
We just don't happen to care.

20:55.771 --> 20:58.940
Considering
the steep cost of
the ticket, friend,

20:58.974 --> 21:01.542
I'm simply hoping
to maximize the pleasure

21:01.576 --> 21:03.577
of your movie-going
experience

21:03.612 --> 21:06.380
by telling you that
the film you've selected

21:06.415 --> 21:08.449
is what we in the industry

21:08.483 --> 21:10.785
commonly refer to as a stinker.

21:10.819 --> 21:13.187
Mason, they don't want to hear

21:13.221 --> 21:14.155
your opinion, all right?

21:14.189 --> 21:15.623
You're backing the lines up

21:15.657 --> 21:16.590
into next Thursday.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.159
Be that as it may, my boy,

21:18.193 --> 21:19.493
cinema is sacred.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.129
Each experience
should transport us

21:22.164 --> 21:24.598
to a world worthy of our time

21:24.633 --> 21:26.600
and hard-earned cash.

21:26.635 --> 21:29.704
Listen, why don't you
just take our tickets

21:29.738 --> 21:30.771
and let us in, buddy!

21:30.806 --> 21:31.772
First man: Yeah!

21:31.807 --> 21:32.974
Second man: Come on!

21:33.008 --> 21:34.809
Woman: Come on, Mason!

21:34.843 --> 21:35.876
So, what happened?

21:35.911 --> 21:37.912
If we're lucky,
we might get
to see a riot.

21:37.946 --> 21:39.580
Movie Mason's a ticket taker,

21:39.614 --> 21:40.915
but he's not letting people

21:40.949 --> 21:42.450
into movies he doesn't like.

21:42.484 --> 21:43.584
Did you see Pete?

21:43.618 --> 21:44.919
No, but something's up, though.

21:44.953 --> 21:46.187
If they've got Mason working,

21:46.221 --> 21:47.788
who knows what's going on?

21:47.823 --> 21:50.825
<i>Glimpses of Genevieve</i>
has been nominated
for more awards

21:50.859 --> 21:52.660
than all 5 of last
year's Oscar nominees.

21:52.694 --> 21:53.694
Jeez! We don't care!

21:53.729 --> 21:56.497
You owe it to yourself
to give it a chance.

21:56.531 --> 21:57.598
You want to give this a chance?

21:57.632 --> 21:59.433
Pete: Whoa,
whoa, whoa!
Sir, please!

21:59.468 --> 22:00.468
You just settle down.

22:00.502 --> 22:02.203
Well, tell this guy to
cut with the critic act

22:02.237 --> 22:03.371
and let us into our movie!

22:03.405 --> 22:05.673
I'm only attempting
to impart to him

22:05.707 --> 22:08.342
that the magic
of the movies
is a treasure

22:08.377 --> 22:10.244
not to be taken lightly.

22:10.278 --> 22:13.214
Mason? Here! Now!

22:13.248 --> 22:14.315
Crowd: Ooh!

22:14.349 --> 22:15.483
Man: Yeah! Spank him!

22:15.517 --> 22:16.751
First woman: Whoo hoo!

22:16.785 --> 22:18.219
Man: Spank him!
Bye-bye, now!

22:18.253 --> 22:20.354
Second woman:
Come on! Yeah!

22:23.325 --> 22:26.460
I, sir, do not
appreciate being
spoken to

22:26.495 --> 22:28.462
as if I were a canine.

22:28.497 --> 22:30.531
Well, I just heard
from Mr. nedermeyer

22:30.565 --> 22:33.200
who says that you are
an insurance liability
waiting to happen,

22:33.235 --> 22:36.203
and he wants you
out of here immediately.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.674
This is an outrage!

22:40.709 --> 22:43.244
Save it for someone
who cares. Go!

22:43.278 --> 22:45.446
You can't treat
movie Mason
like this!

22:45.480 --> 22:46.747
He's a legend!
Yeah!

22:46.782 --> 22:49.216
Shawn: Not to me!

22:49.251 --> 22:50.184
Look,

22:50.218 --> 22:51.385
I'm under enough
pressure tonight,

22:51.420 --> 22:52.653
old-timer,

22:52.687 --> 22:55.156
so scram
or I'll call the police.

23:02.998 --> 23:04.598
Mason: Enjoy your show!

23:04.633 --> 23:07.568
Tell my theater that
even when I'm not here,

23:07.602 --> 23:10.137
its magic is never far
from my heart.

23:14.409 --> 23:16.043
Someday, you'll
have to explain to me

23:16.078 --> 23:17.378
how people like you and Mason

23:17.412 --> 23:19.013
can get so worked up
about movies.

23:19.047 --> 23:21.449
Maybe it's because
we have fun,
Mr. assistant manager,

23:21.483 --> 23:23.217
something you obviously
can't relate to.

23:23.251 --> 23:25.219
Why? Because I'd rather
earn a few bucks

23:25.253 --> 23:27.021
than sit in a dark
theater daydreaming?

23:27.055 --> 23:29.190
No. Because you're
so locked into
achievement mode,

23:29.224 --> 23:31.592
you're like
the oldest-looking
teenager I know.

23:31.626 --> 23:33.928
Can I get some vending candy?

23:33.962 --> 23:35.229
Yeah.

23:40.035 --> 23:43.137
Look, you and Brian
get in to your show
and behave, ok?

23:43.171 --> 23:44.805
We're way too shorthanded,

23:44.840 --> 23:45.906
we got this huge premiere,

23:45.941 --> 23:47.675
and nedermeyer calls
every 5 seconds

23:47.709 --> 23:50.044
to say that
everything has to
be totally...

23:52.314 --> 23:53.747
Perfect.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.991
You know, if you
want to impress her,

24:04.025 --> 24:05.426
it's probably
better not to drool.

24:05.460 --> 24:06.427
Grow up!

24:06.461 --> 24:09.029
I'm trying to,
but mom won't let me.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.438
What'd you do?

24:17.472 --> 24:19.173
Uh... I didn't do anything!

24:19.207 --> 24:20.441
I just lifted it up,

24:20.475 --> 24:21.876
and it snapped right off!

24:24.980 --> 24:27.248
We can't interrupt
Pete right now,
or he'll go nuts.

24:27.282 --> 24:29.049
Why can't I just, you know,

24:29.084 --> 24:30.217
put it down and run?

24:30.252 --> 24:33.754
Hey, what's
the problem,
little Pete?

24:33.788 --> 24:36.123
Uh... Uh... This came off,
but it's not my fault.

24:36.158 --> 24:37.258
I was just...
Uh, I was just...

24:37.292 --> 24:39.793
It's no biggie, kid.
All you gotta do

24:39.828 --> 24:42.730
is just pop it back on...

24:42.764 --> 24:44.031
Uhh!

24:44.065 --> 24:45.166
Like this.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.467
Uhh!

24:46.501 --> 24:51.205
Aah!
Wh-wh-whoa!

24:51.273 --> 24:52.873
Aah! Uhh!

24:52.908 --> 24:54.975
Aah! Uhh!

24:55.010 --> 24:57.178
What the heck did you do, kid?

24:57.212 --> 24:59.380
He didn't do it,
Donny. You did.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.482
Hey! I barely
touched it.

25:01.516 --> 25:03.317
Uhh!

25:03.351 --> 25:05.986
Phantom of
the megaplex
strikes again!

25:06.021 --> 25:07.421
Let's go.

25:07.455 --> 25:10.057
Woman: What's next?

25:10.091 --> 25:12.293
Excuse me, ladies.
Duty calls.

25:12.327 --> 25:15.462
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

25:15.497 --> 25:18.032
Excuse me.
Comin' through.

25:18.066 --> 25:19.934
Come on!
Let's go!

25:34.716 --> 25:35.616
Whoa!

25:35.650 --> 25:37.184
Go!
Go!
Go!

25:42.123 --> 25:43.791
Wah!

25:48.396 --> 25:51.131
Oh... Wah!

25:52.567 --> 25:53.734
Whoo!

25:55.470 --> 25:57.137
Yeah!

26:09.100 --> 26:11.869
Om!

26:11.903 --> 26:14.571
Aren't you just dying to enter?

26:14.606 --> 26:17.441
I'm gonna go save us some seats.

26:17.475 --> 26:18.509
Man: Oh, yeah!
You're gonna
have nightmares

26:18.543 --> 26:19.777
when this is over.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.049
Man, could you guys
have cut it any closer?

26:25.083 --> 26:26.884
The movie starts
in, like, 15 seconds.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.687
Is Erica saving us seats?
Better hope so, huh?

26:29.721 --> 26:30.988
Go in.
I'll be right there.

26:31.022 --> 26:32.289
Gotta get the bri guy set up.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.558
You make it sound
like I'm a beach chair.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.660
I'll see you in 5.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.534
Come on!

26:43.568 --> 26:44.535
Announcer:
At our refreshment center,

26:44.569 --> 26:45.803
you'll find a large
variety of goodies

26:45.837 --> 26:48.038
to satisfy your hunger,
your thirst,

26:48.073 --> 26:51.342
or your sweet tooth.
So, hurry, hurry, hurry!

26:51.376 --> 26:52.843
Visit our
refreshment center today.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.311
Ok. You remember,

26:54.346 --> 26:55.512
if Pete comes in to check on us,

26:55.547 --> 26:57.314
just say I'm in
the ladies room, ok?

26:57.349 --> 26:58.682
If he comes back a second time,

26:58.717 --> 27:00.985
then just, you know,
make up another excuse.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.419
What if he goes looking for you?

27:02.454 --> 27:03.654
That's my problem.

27:03.688 --> 27:05.656
Look, if you want
your 10 bucks
and a free movie,

27:05.690 --> 27:07.558
you'd better not
blow this for me, ok?

27:07.592 --> 27:09.259
Ok. Happy nightmares.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.261
You sure you're ok with this?

27:11.296 --> 27:13.998
No offense, but
i can see you anytime.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.033
I'm here to see a movie.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.238
Ok. You're gonna
stay here, right,
no matter what,

27:21.272 --> 27:24.975
and you're gonna be
in this exact spot
when I get back, right?

27:25.010 --> 27:26.377
Ok.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.645
You better,
or I'll tell
the cinema sitter.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.092
Announcer:
The grand megaplex

28:15.126 --> 28:17.795
invites you to refrain
from using cell phones

28:17.829 --> 28:18.762
and pagers during the movie.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.097
Hey, you know
Madison Ashley Metz

28:20.131 --> 28:22.933
isn't the only movie
star who's gonna be
here tonight.

28:22.967 --> 28:24.334
I heard, you know,
what's-his-name

28:24.369 --> 28:26.603
from <i> loflin's dream</i>
is coming, too.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.238
Jacob Johnson?

28:28.273 --> 28:30.741
You mean,
Jacob Johnson's
gonna be here?

28:30.775 --> 28:32.776
That's what my sources tell me.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.244
I don't mean to brag,

28:34.279 --> 28:36.080
but since
I'm the assistant
manager,

28:36.114 --> 28:38.615
I might be able
to introduce you
to him.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.284
I don't know
if I could handle it.

28:40.318 --> 28:45.789
How raw would that be
to, like, touch
Jacob Johnson's hand?

28:45.824 --> 28:47.991
Could we maybe get
a picture with him?

28:48.026 --> 28:49.293
If that's what you want,

28:49.327 --> 28:50.761
it's my job to make it happen.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.130
I didn't know you had
so much power around here.

28:53.164 --> 28:54.331
Are you kidding?

28:54.365 --> 28:55.799
By the time I'm 18,

28:55.834 --> 28:57.267
I'll probably be
running this place,

28:57.302 --> 28:59.903
and since they just
named a new general
manager,

28:59.938 --> 29:01.939
I might even get
a promotion tonight.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.374
Will you still
get to wear your
little red bow tie?

29:04.409 --> 29:06.443
Are you making fun
of my bow tie?

29:06.478 --> 29:10.347
No. I love it.
I totally do.

29:10.381 --> 29:13.283
Scary thing is, she's serious.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.155
Pete: Here.

29:18.189 --> 29:20.691
Uh, guard it with your life.

29:22.894 --> 29:25.129
Sorry to bust up your
little party here, petie,

29:25.163 --> 29:27.531
but Hillary and Lacy
are lookin' for ya.

29:27.565 --> 29:32.636
Something about
a popcorn emergency? Ha ha!

29:33.705 --> 29:36.940
See ya!

29:36.975 --> 29:39.910
What's going on?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.445
Girl: Get the manager!

29:41.479 --> 29:43.080
It's like those
battery commercials.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.149
We put
the exact amount in
for one batch,

29:45.183 --> 29:46.216
like we always do,

29:46.251 --> 29:49.686
but it just keeps
going and going
and going.

29:49.721 --> 29:50.721
Look at this, hon'.

29:50.755 --> 29:52.356
Why don't you just shut it off?

29:52.390 --> 29:54.758
We flipped the switch,
like, 50 times, but it
didn't do anything!

29:54.792 --> 29:58.896
Why don't you
just try this, huh?

30:01.032 --> 30:03.333
Why didn't we think of that?

30:04.569 --> 30:07.204
Better clean this up.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.239
I'll get the broom and dustpan?

30:09.274 --> 30:10.741
Yeah.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.145
Excuse me!

30:15.180 --> 30:16.813
Excuse me, my dear.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.315
I'm not a complainer by nature,

30:18.349 --> 30:20.417
but you really must come
inside and look at this.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.319
When we paid to see
<i>glimpses of Genevieve,</i>

30:22.353 --> 30:23.987
we had no idea that the title

30:24.022 --> 30:26.723
would be so...
Literal.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.929
First man: Hey, man!
What's going on
with this thing?

30:31.963 --> 30:32.930
It's crazy!

30:32.964 --> 30:34.898
Fix the projector!

30:34.933 --> 30:39.236
Focus! Come on, focus!

30:45.677 --> 30:46.910
Second man:
These rotten kids!

30:46.945 --> 30:49.179
We'll squawk
until they do
something about it!

30:49.214 --> 30:51.515
Excuse me.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.154
Hillary!

30:57.188 --> 30:58.422
Where's Shawn?

30:58.456 --> 31:00.290
Well, did you try
his office, sweetie?

31:00.325 --> 31:01.391
He's not in there.
What about Pete?

31:01.426 --> 31:03.293
I think he's in theater 17,

31:03.328 --> 31:04.461
checking on his little brother.

31:04.495 --> 31:06.096
8.75.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.598
Oh! What's going on now?

31:07.632 --> 31:09.633
How long does it take
to go to the bathroom?

31:09.667 --> 31:11.201
When you're a girl, forever.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.306
But you're ok here, right?

31:16.341 --> 31:17.641
Woman in movie:
But I want to go!

31:17.675 --> 31:19.476
Emergency in theater 23.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.879
W-w-what kind
of an emergency?
Can I come?

31:22.914 --> 31:24.314
No. Stay.

31:24.349 --> 31:25.616
Woman in movie:
Oh! It's not fair!

31:25.650 --> 31:27.517
I always get left behind.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.987
Now, no matter
what happens, baby,

31:30.021 --> 31:32.356
I want you to
promise me you'll
stay right here.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.824
Oh!

31:42.900 --> 31:45.435
Folks? Uh, excuse me.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.104
If I could have your attention,

31:47.138 --> 31:49.773
I'm Pete Riley,
the assistant manager here.

31:49.807 --> 31:50.847
What, do you want a medal?

31:52.343 --> 31:55.245
Uh, we're hoping to have
this problem

31:55.280 --> 31:56.513
with the projector fixed soon.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.282
Uh, we're gonna start
your movie over,

31:58.316 --> 32:00.117
or, if you'd rather
get your money back,

32:00.151 --> 32:01.385
you can see me in the lobby
for a full refund

32:01.419 --> 32:02.386
or a return pass.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.488
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

32:05.623 --> 32:08.025
This isn't
an accident,
you know.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.861
It's sabotage,
exactly like in
<i>judson's revenge.</i>

32:10.895 --> 32:12.396
I thought I told you
to stay in your seat.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.131
I'm just trying to help, ok?

32:14.165 --> 32:15.766
See, I'm betting
that the phantom
of the megaplex

32:15.800 --> 32:18.368
doesn't like your
bringing a big
Hollywood party

32:18.403 --> 32:19.336
into his home.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.004
Brian? Hey,
don't start with me, ok?

32:21.039 --> 32:22.306
We have 26 screens here.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.640
Things are always going wrong.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.542
Yeah, but all
in one night?
I mean, come on!

32:25.576 --> 32:27.144
The candy bin crashing down,

32:27.178 --> 32:29.112
and now this focus thing?

32:29.147 --> 32:32.082
Yeah. You don't even
know about the maniac
popcorn machine.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.217
See?
In <i> judson's revenge,</i>

32:34.252 --> 32:35.519
the guy, Kevin eastman...

32:35.553 --> 32:36.520
See, what happens is,

32:36.554 --> 32:37.721
he thinks he's been cheated

32:37.755 --> 32:39.556
by this big power company,

32:39.590 --> 32:40.624
but no one'll
listen to him.
He has to...

32:40.658 --> 32:41.792
All right. Enough, ok?

32:41.826 --> 32:43.593
Get back to <i> farmer brown</i> now.

32:43.628 --> 32:47.898
Ok, but I'm tellin' ya,
sabotage.

33:02.847 --> 33:04.014
Hyah!

33:24.869 --> 33:25.836
This is so crazy!

33:25.870 --> 33:27.137
It's like, every step we take,

33:27.171 --> 33:28.171
somebody's watching us.

33:28.206 --> 33:29.573
Uh-huh.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.408
Duh! It's a horror movie.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.578
Isn't he so unbelievably cute?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.482
I dare you to scream
"i love Phil Dalton"

33:38.516 --> 33:40.350
at the top of your lungs.
Why don't you?

33:40.385 --> 33:42.285
Are you insane?

33:42.353 --> 33:45.422
Never dare April to do anything.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.090
She won't do it.

33:47.125 --> 33:51.161
You guys,
you're gonna get us
so kicked out of here.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.831
Woman in movie:
Come on! Let's go!
Let's just go!

33:54.866 --> 33:56.299
Man in movie: No! No!

33:56.334 --> 33:59.836
My name is Karen Riley,
and I love Phil Dalton.

33:59.871 --> 34:00.804
Shh!

34:00.838 --> 34:02.806
I can't believe you did that!

34:02.840 --> 34:04.374
Sorry!

34:04.409 --> 34:06.476
Pipe down back there!

34:06.511 --> 34:09.279
Time to go check on Brian.

34:09.313 --> 34:12.282
Wait! I'm scared!

34:17.688 --> 34:19.989
Man in movie:
What? Oh, man!

34:21.391 --> 34:23.059
Man in movie:
They're gone!

34:23.094 --> 34:26.530
I turn my back for one second...

34:26.563 --> 34:28.732
I don't get it.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.500
Where'd everything go?

34:30.534 --> 34:32.768
Is something wrong, dear?

34:32.804 --> 34:34.638
Oh, no, no, no. No, uh,
when I was in the bathroom,

34:34.672 --> 34:36.306
I guess my brother had to go.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.674
Shh!
Shh!

34:37.708 --> 34:39.141
He'll be back.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.844
Man in movie:
Caroline?

34:41.879 --> 34:43.647
Caroline, honey?

34:46.016 --> 34:51.087
Why? Why? I begged you
to stay put!

34:57.762 --> 34:59.796
I don't know why
Shawn isn't answering

34:59.831 --> 35:01.731
his cell phone,
Mr. nedermeyer.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.767
Um, uh, he's, uh...

35:03.801 --> 35:06.803
He's... he's outside
doing, um, uh...

35:06.838 --> 35:08.672
Right, premiere stuff.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.474
Uh, yes, sir.

35:10.508 --> 35:14.511
The minute he comes in,
I'll have him call you.

35:14.545 --> 35:17.547
This is way against
operating procedure.

35:17.582 --> 35:18.682
Where is Shawn?

35:18.716 --> 35:20.050
Nedermeyer's gonna
blow a motherboard

35:20.084 --> 35:21.318
if he doesn't hear from him.

35:21.352 --> 35:23.820
I think it's scary.
Shawn wouldn't
disappear tonight.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.156
Shawn wouldn't disappear ever.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.958
Running this place is his life.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.794
What if the phantom
of the megaplex
got him?

35:30.828 --> 35:32.295
Don't even joke, ok, hon'?

35:32.330 --> 35:34.464
Stuff like that
totally creeps me out.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.833
Afraid he'll suck your blood?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.235
Want to hear the latest?

35:38.269 --> 35:39.603
The second Pete got
the projector fixed

35:39.637 --> 35:40.570
in theater 22,

35:40.605 --> 35:42.272
and there's a whole
new disaster in 21.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.341
Come on, Lacy.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.510
Let's go find Shawn.

35:51.282 --> 35:54.484
Pete: And now,<i> cut to black,</i>
our most popular movie,

35:54.519 --> 35:55.986
has the lights going berserk,

35:56.020 --> 35:57.587
and I don't know how to stop it.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.155
I mean, all I know
is that the lights

35:59.190 --> 36:00.957
are tied into
the same computer program

36:00.992 --> 36:02.425
as the projection system.

36:02.460 --> 36:05.128
Why isn't merle up here?

36:05.162 --> 36:06.963
Merle the projectionist?

36:06.998 --> 36:10.166
But he's the only one
who showed up here tonight.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.469
How's he supposed to be
in all 3 booths at once?

36:12.503 --> 36:15.772
He's probably in west 4
getting a <i> martian mountain</i>

36:15.806 --> 36:18.174
uh, well, go grab him, mark.
Tell him it's an emergency.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.243
All right.

36:33.824 --> 36:37.527
How can a whole computer
program go into
spontaneous meltdown?

36:37.562 --> 36:40.964
Like I said before, sabotage!

36:40.998 --> 36:42.799
How'd you get up here?

36:42.833 --> 36:44.834
I was in Indian guides,
remember?

36:44.869 --> 36:47.571
I slipped in
when mark slipped out.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.239
I'm only trying to help,
ok, Pete?

36:49.273 --> 36:51.241
Ok, well, don't, ok?

36:51.275 --> 36:52.742
I have too much
to deal with already.

36:52.777 --> 36:55.579
Man! It's so cool
in here!

36:55.613 --> 36:59.249
Let me guess.
Karen has absolutely
no clue where you are.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.151
Who cares?
I'm telling you,

37:01.185 --> 37:02.719
you need me to
help you solve this.

37:02.753 --> 37:03.653
You do!

37:03.688 --> 37:05.155
There's nothing to solve, Brian.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.356
Oh, yeah?

37:06.390 --> 37:08.692
How come nobody
in this whole place
can find Shawn?

37:08.726 --> 37:11.761
Shawn's still missing?

37:11.796 --> 37:15.432
This is really
getting weird.
Where could he be?

37:15.466 --> 37:18.401
I heard once
there was this multiplex

37:18.436 --> 37:21.171
in like Oregon
or "michigon"
or one of those places,

37:21.205 --> 37:25.809
and every Saturday
night for 2 months,
a different guy...

37:27.545 --> 37:30.780
Aah! Oh!
What the heck
was that?

37:32.683 --> 37:34.451
Oh!

37:42.526 --> 37:44.427
Lose somebody?

37:44.462 --> 37:46.563
Oh, uh, it's my little brother.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.198
You mean you still
haven't found him?

37:48.232 --> 37:50.266
No, no. He came back,
but now he's gone again.

37:50.301 --> 37:52.502
Oh!

37:52.536 --> 37:53.937
What's his name?

37:53.971 --> 37:55.972
Brian. Brian Riley.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.475
If Brian Riley is present,

37:58.509 --> 38:00.410
please finish
your business promptly

38:00.444 --> 38:03.713
and report
to your sister at once!

38:03.748 --> 38:05.482
Now, when he emerges,

38:05.516 --> 38:09.953
I want you two
to get into your seats
and stay put.

38:14.191 --> 38:15.759
No torn sprocket hole

38:15.793 --> 38:18.294
that's confusing the computer.

38:18.329 --> 38:21.297
No stripped brains.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.033
No tripped trees.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.634
I don't know.

38:28.639 --> 38:33.009
Yeah.
Platter's in place.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.811
Ok. So I don't have as
much to do around here

38:34.845 --> 38:36.279
since we went
into full automation.

38:36.313 --> 38:38.415
Somehow, the powers that be
think that's progress.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.783
Who am I to argue?

38:39.817 --> 38:41.217
But, uh, while I'm underpaid

38:41.252 --> 38:42.252
and under-appreciated,

38:42.286 --> 38:44.320
I'm still <i> numero uno</i>
at figuring out

38:44.355 --> 38:46.122
how and why things go wrong.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.258
Ok, master merle, enlighten me.

38:48.292 --> 38:50.326
Well, I think
the problem here,
my friend,

38:50.361 --> 38:52.595
is, uh, someone's
deliberate attempt

38:52.630 --> 38:53.730
to ruin our big night.

38:53.764 --> 38:55.465
Thank you.
I've only been trying

38:55.499 --> 38:56.800
to tell him that
for the last hour.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.468
Well, can we straighten it out?

38:58.502 --> 39:00.070
If I can't, nobody can,

39:00.104 --> 39:01.571
but it's gonna
take a few minutes.

39:01.605 --> 39:04.374
Ok. Well, if you've
got everything under
control here,

39:04.408 --> 39:07.143
I'm gonna
head downstairs
to prevent a riot.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.885
Pete: Please, if i
could just have your...

39:15.920 --> 39:17.420
I'm really just trying
to tell you,

39:17.455 --> 39:18.855
if you just... Excuse me!

39:18.889 --> 39:21.458
Quiet!

39:24.528 --> 39:26.396
Thanks.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.264
Told you I was
good to have around.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.068
Folks, I know this has
been very frustrating,

39:32.103 --> 39:34.204
but your movie will be
starting over momentarily.

39:34.238 --> 39:35.572
If you'd rather leave now,

39:35.606 --> 39:37.807
refunds can be obtained
in the main lobby

39:37.842 --> 39:39.776
from my senior manager
Shawn macgibbon.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.111
If anyone can find him.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.649
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.788
Good job!

39:55.693 --> 39:57.794
This is getting
way totally spooky.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.095
Terri and I looked
everywhere for Shawn.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.263
We absolutely can't find him.

40:00.297 --> 40:01.464
And then, when we were
coming out of his office,

40:01.499 --> 40:03.166
this total guy in black
shot out of nowhere

40:03.200 --> 40:04.134
and ran down the stairs.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.035
I am so not kidding.
We both saw him.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.504
Brian: Why won't
you guys admit it?

40:07.538 --> 40:09.005
It's the phantom
of the megaplex.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.307
And nedermeyer, he keeps
calling for Shawn.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.009
Plus, you know the fog
machine he had delivered

40:13.043 --> 40:14.344
so it'd be going off
when the guests arrived

40:14.378 --> 40:15.345
for the premiere?

40:15.379 --> 40:16.780
Now it's disappeared,

40:16.814 --> 40:19.382
and nobody's even gotten
the velvet ropes

40:19.416 --> 40:22.919
for the red carpet out of
the downstairs lobby yet.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.922
Ok. Brian, I need you.

40:25.956 --> 40:28.358
About time
you admitted it.
Yeah.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.629
When I find that little brat,

40:32.663 --> 40:33.830
I'm gonna pound him, i swear.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.832
Thanks to him,
I've got
the cinema sitter

40:35.866 --> 40:37.767
turning into my own
personal stalker.

40:37.802 --> 40:40.837
You want to bet
the bri guy's messing
with you on purpose?

40:40.871 --> 40:41.871
Shh!

40:41.906 --> 40:43.239
Shh!

40:43.274 --> 40:45.408
I'm not the one who's talking.

40:45.442 --> 40:47.277
You are now.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.847
Got to go find Brian.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.882
You're missing the whole movie.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.050
Mother's magic.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.752
She didn't
want me to
see this movie,

40:55.786 --> 40:57.420
now I'm not.

41:05.029 --> 41:08.298
Shawn? Is that you?

41:08.332 --> 41:10.500
Oh, man!
Who did this to you?

41:11.502 --> 41:13.603
Probably be easier
for him to answer

41:13.637 --> 41:15.038
if you took the tape off.

41:21.445 --> 41:22.946
Pete: Uhh!

41:22.980 --> 41:25.849
I... ha ha!

41:25.883 --> 41:27.350
What happened?

41:29.220 --> 41:30.653
I don't have a clue.

41:30.688 --> 41:32.055
I, uh, i came down here

41:32.089 --> 41:33.022
to get these ropes.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.324
Someone shoved me from behind,

41:34.358 --> 41:35.825
held me down, tied my hands,

41:35.860 --> 41:36.993
put tape over my mouth,

41:37.027 --> 41:38.361
before i saw a thing!

41:38.395 --> 41:39.596
♪ Da da da ♪

41:39.630 --> 41:43.533
Phantom of the megaplex is back!

41:46.804 --> 41:49.505
Sir?
It's not that I didn't
want to answer your calls.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.475
I was simply...
Tied up. Ha ha!

41:52.509 --> 41:55.044
You and lamonica
are having dinner
with who, sir?

41:55.079 --> 41:57.146
I am impressed!

41:57.181 --> 41:58.448
How soon?

41:58.482 --> 42:00.683
No, no.
Please, don't rush.

42:00.718 --> 42:03.052
Really. Stay.
Have a nice, long dessert.

42:03.087 --> 42:05.555
We'll have everything
in order for you
when you arrive.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.860
60 minutes! Do you hear me?

42:10.895 --> 42:13.296
Yes! In one short hour,
nedermeyer will arrive

42:13.330 --> 42:16.266
with that waste of sweat
lamonica and Tyler jesseman.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.368
Yes! The director
of <i> midnight mayhem.</i>

42:18.402 --> 42:20.336
We must find out
who is causing this chaos

42:20.371 --> 42:22.705
and make it stop. All right?

42:22.740 --> 42:24.707
Pete, Ricky, inside.

42:24.742 --> 42:26.542
Someone take half-pint
back to his show,

42:26.577 --> 42:27.677
and please check all theaters

42:27.711 --> 42:28.778
for any signs of trouble.

42:28.812 --> 42:30.680
Where is your bow tie?

42:30.714 --> 42:33.016
Uh, I'll go get it.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.485
Go! Go, go, go!

42:41.558 --> 42:43.993
There you are!
Finally!

42:44.028 --> 42:45.662
Yeah. Nice job
of watching Brian.

42:45.696 --> 42:47.463
I can explain!

42:48.599 --> 42:50.667
Oh, great!

42:50.701 --> 42:53.269
All right, get to the top.

42:54.305 --> 42:55.305
Oh, good.

42:55.339 --> 42:57.340
Come on!

42:57.374 --> 42:59.609
Do you see what
I'm up against
tonight?

42:59.643 --> 43:02.312
Yeah! Fighting
the phantom!

43:02.346 --> 43:05.315
Look. Either you two
get into your seats
in <i> farmer brown</i>

43:05.349 --> 43:06.282
and stay there,

43:06.317 --> 43:07.550
or I'm running you
home right now.

43:07.584 --> 43:09.185
I'm totally serious.

43:09.219 --> 43:10.586
Wow!
There's a big shock!

43:10.621 --> 43:11.621
You being serious?

43:11.655 --> 43:14.290
Catch me!
I'm about to faint.

43:17.227 --> 43:18.294
Brian:
I know we promised,

43:18.329 --> 43:20.396
but don't you want to be a hero?

43:20.431 --> 43:21.531
You're so lame, Brian.

43:21.565 --> 43:23.399
We're not gonna stop
what's going on here.

43:23.434 --> 43:24.400
Why not?

43:24.435 --> 43:26.436
What did dad always say, huh?

43:26.470 --> 43:27.737
If you pay attention,

43:27.771 --> 43:29.605
the movies can
teach you about life.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.040
How is that relevant?

43:31.075 --> 43:33.543
Don't you get
what this guy's doing?

43:33.577 --> 43:36.079
In <i> glimpses of Genevieve,</i>

43:36.113 --> 43:37.914
the projector was going nuts.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.749
Glimpses, see?

43:39.783 --> 43:40.817
In <i> cut to black,</i>

43:40.851 --> 43:42.518
the lights were going
on and off.

43:42.553 --> 43:45.088
The titles match the troubles.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.991
Exactly. So what you
and me need to do

43:48.025 --> 43:50.760
is figure out where
he's gonna strike next.

43:50.794 --> 43:52.628
Right!

43:52.663 --> 43:53.663
Come on!

43:59.536 --> 44:02.171
What happened to the fan?

44:02.206 --> 44:04.207
Run for your lives, children!

44:04.241 --> 44:06.309
It's a tornado!

44:06.343 --> 44:07.477
Excellent!

44:16.286 --> 44:17.253
Aah!

44:17.287 --> 44:18.621
Aah!

44:21.825 --> 44:23.192
Aah!
Ow!

44:38.475 --> 44:39.475
Look!
There's Caitlin!
Who?

44:41.412 --> 44:44.814
Duh! The girl
Pete likes!

44:44.848 --> 44:46.015
Ah-choo!

44:46.050 --> 44:48.084
Aah! Aah!

44:50.354 --> 44:52.088
Sorry!

44:52.122 --> 44:54.690
Thanks!
Don't worry, ladies!

44:54.725 --> 44:56.993
I'll take care of it!

44:59.663 --> 45:01.431
Whoa!

45:02.433 --> 45:03.666
Good look on you, Donny.

45:03.700 --> 45:06.169
You should adopt it permanently!

45:06.203 --> 45:07.870
Come on! Let's go!

45:07.905 --> 45:08.871
Ok, ok, ok!

45:08.906 --> 45:12.275
Oh! Uhh!

45:20.517 --> 45:22.652
Come here! Come here!

45:24.021 --> 45:25.555
Uhh!

45:40.537 --> 45:43.639
A lost reservation
and no room for us
at <i> Chez patrice?</i>

45:43.674 --> 45:46.809
This joint's
suddenly gone
belly up.

45:46.844 --> 45:50.146
Well, so much for
our perfect evening.

45:50.180 --> 45:53.249
It's ok. George,
do you see those plants

45:53.283 --> 45:55.084
hanging over there?

45:55.119 --> 45:59.021
They seem perfectly
content, don't they?

45:59.056 --> 46:01.791
Sure. They look great.

46:01.825 --> 46:04.060
So, it wouldn't
really make any sense
to uproot them,

46:04.094 --> 46:06.095
put them into a single pot,

46:06.130 --> 46:09.499
impose, you know,
some kind of
forced blending thing.

46:09.533 --> 46:10.633
Ha!

46:12.302 --> 46:14.604
Well, you could do that,

46:14.638 --> 46:18.441
but if it got all messed up,

46:18.475 --> 46:19.675
uh, don't you run the risk

46:19.710 --> 46:21.077
of ruining them both?

46:21.111 --> 46:23.613
I mean, the roots get entangled

46:23.647 --> 46:24.981
and the stems get twisted and...

46:25.015 --> 46:26.215
Yeah.

46:26.250 --> 46:29.285
It's not just
the plants that you
have to think about.

46:29.319 --> 46:30.887
What about the buds?

46:30.921 --> 46:34.290
I mean, how would they react

46:34.324 --> 46:36.292
to this, uh, turf invasion?

46:36.326 --> 46:39.595
Hey, don't get me wrong.

46:39.630 --> 46:44.100
It's not
that I'm afraid
of re-potting.

46:44.134 --> 46:47.069
I just
think you have to
take it slow,

46:47.104 --> 46:49.005
you know,

46:49.039 --> 46:50.573
examine every angle.

46:50.607 --> 46:51.974
Mm-hmm.

46:54.378 --> 46:55.711
I agree.

46:55.746 --> 46:57.079
I agree.

46:57.114 --> 46:59.682
Personally,
I've never been
comfortable

46:59.716 --> 47:03.386
trying anything
that I wasn't sure
i could succeed at.

47:03.420 --> 47:06.756
Maybe all we can do
is trust that if and when
the time is right,

47:06.790 --> 47:08.257
we'll both know it.

47:11.094 --> 47:12.295
Ok.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.331
Ooh! Who's this?

47:15.365 --> 47:17.133
It's not a number i recognize.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.267
Here.

47:20.337 --> 47:22.305
Here.

47:31.048 --> 47:32.014
Mom?

47:32.049 --> 47:34.083
Pete! Where are you?

47:34.117 --> 47:35.084
The lobby pay phone.

47:35.118 --> 47:36.352
Is anything wrong?

47:36.386 --> 47:37.520
No, no, everything's fine...

47:37.554 --> 47:41.157
Sort of. Um, mom,
i really hate to do this,

47:41.191 --> 47:44.393
but Shawn canceled
all dinner breaks tonight
since we're so understaffed,

47:44.428 --> 47:46.068
and I thought I could
bring the kids home,

47:46.096 --> 47:48.364
only we're so not ready
for the premiere.

47:48.398 --> 47:50.233
You need me to pick up
Brian and Karen.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.735
It's no problem.
I'll bring George with me.

47:52.769 --> 47:53.970
Sorry.

47:54.004 --> 47:55.805
No, I don't want them
standing on the street.

47:55.839 --> 47:57.139
Tell 'em to sit
on that blue bench

47:57.174 --> 47:59.108
down in the lower lobby.
I'll meet them there.

47:59.142 --> 48:00.576
All right. Thanks.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.982
Another change of plans.
I'm sorry.

48:06.016 --> 48:09.318
We've gotta go pick up
Brian and Karen.

48:15.459 --> 48:17.660
Oh, no.

48:17.694 --> 48:20.162
Pete: You guys were
never gonna get to stay
for the premiere anyway,

48:20.197 --> 48:21.731
so I don't know what
you're moaning about.

48:21.765 --> 48:23.799
Besides, mom and George
are already on their way.

48:23.834 --> 48:26.435
Man, we don't even
get to find out
who the phantom is?

48:26.470 --> 48:28.571
Riley, it's movie Mason...

48:28.605 --> 48:30.172
Our so-called
phantom.

48:30.207 --> 48:31.240
Think about it.

48:31.275 --> 48:32.708
He's ticked
at me for having
tossed him out.

48:32.743 --> 48:33.743
He's never gotten over the fact

48:33.777 --> 48:35.111
that he
doesn't still
own this place.

48:35.145 --> 48:36.112
What better revenge than

48:36.146 --> 48:37.413
ruining our biggest night?

48:37.447 --> 48:39.348
Mason would never do
anything that mean.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.784
Movies are like... like
sacred to him!

48:41.818 --> 48:43.085
In my opinion,
that crazy
old coot

48:43.120 --> 48:44.086
is capable of anything.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.388
You don't know him at all.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.290
He's, like,
the sweetest person
that ever lived.

48:47.324 --> 48:50.760
Why are these
small... People
talking to me?

48:50.794 --> 48:53.195
Guys, will you just
cool it, all right?
This doesn't concern you.

48:53.230 --> 48:55.765
It does if he's gonna
go around bad-mouthing
movie Mason!

48:55.799 --> 48:56.966
Karen: Yeah!

48:57.000 --> 48:58.868
I am telling you,

48:58.902 --> 49:02.204
he is our
phantom and i
want him found.

49:04.308 --> 49:06.409
All right, I gotta go
look for Mason.

49:06.476 --> 49:07.916
I want you two
sitting on this bench.

49:07.944 --> 49:10.880
I don't want you doing
anything till mom
gets here, ok?

49:14.685 --> 49:15.818
Reporter: Connie,
I'm standing in front

49:15.852 --> 49:17.453
of the grand theater downtown,

49:17.487 --> 49:18.988
where the premiere
of <i> midnight...</i>

49:19.022 --> 49:20.189
Movie Mason
never came back,
right?

49:20.223 --> 49:21.824
No.
Good.

49:21.858 --> 49:24.260
Wait a sec. I saw him.
About an hour ago.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.561
He decided to forgive Shawn

49:25.595 --> 49:28.030
and bought a ticket
to <i> Merlin on Mars.</i>

49:38.975 --> 49:40.376
Gross!

49:40.410 --> 49:42.278
It's movie Mason's
work schedule.

49:42.312 --> 49:45.014
Why does he have
a work schedule
if he doesn't work here?

49:45.048 --> 49:47.450
Pete says every week
Mason types it all up,

49:47.484 --> 49:50.386
and every week Shawn
tosses it out.

49:50.420 --> 49:53.356
Hmm. This is
very interesting.

49:55.359 --> 49:56.759
I'll be right back.

49:56.793 --> 49:59.328
We're not supposed
to leave this bench,
remember?

49:59.363 --> 50:01.764
Hillary, hi.
You remember me, right?

50:01.798 --> 50:03.232
Brian, Pete's little brother?

50:03.266 --> 50:04.400
Brian, honey!
How are you?

50:04.434 --> 50:06.035
Wow! Look how
tall you're
getting.

50:06.069 --> 50:10.005
Movie Mason... When he
takes his dinner breaks,

50:10.040 --> 50:11.474
where does he go?

50:12.409 --> 50:13.709
Why are we doing this?

50:13.744 --> 50:15.277
We're gonna get
in so much trouble.

50:15.312 --> 50:16.979
I didn't say you had
to follow me.

50:17.013 --> 50:18.414
Well, yeah, well, what
was I supposed to do?

50:18.448 --> 50:20.049
Be sitting there all alone
when mom arrives?

50:20.083 --> 50:22.952
"Where's Brian?"
Gee, I have no idea.

50:22.986 --> 50:25.020
God, how grounded would I be?

50:25.055 --> 50:27.089
Not to mention,
this is for employees only.

50:27.124 --> 50:28.691
I mean, how do you
know about it?

50:28.725 --> 50:30.393
I came down here
with Pete earlier.

50:30.427 --> 50:32.528
And we're heading
back down here now
because?

50:32.562 --> 50:33.629
Hillary said Mason

50:33.663 --> 50:35.898
always takes
his dinner breaks
in the basement.

50:35.932 --> 50:37.400
Why? What's
down here?

50:37.434 --> 50:39.535
Probably spiders and...
And rats and...

50:42.239 --> 50:45.541
Whoa!
The phantom?

50:45.575 --> 50:47.042
We gotta get out of here.

50:47.077 --> 50:48.611
Are you nuts?
We can't bail now.

50:48.645 --> 50:52.314
This is exactly like
in <i> officer bean,</i>
<i>talented teen ii.</i>

50:52.349 --> 50:53.482
Look, I don't care.

50:53.517 --> 50:55.351
Mom is gonna be
waiting for us.
Now come on!

50:55.385 --> 50:56.786
No, just think
how proud she'll be

50:56.820 --> 50:59.522
when we show up
with the unmasked
phantom.

51:01.191 --> 51:03.225
Brian. Brian!

51:05.061 --> 51:08.564
I checked both <i> Merlin</i>
<i>on Mars</i> shows. Mason's

51:08.598 --> 51:10.633
I hate thinking that
sweet old man could
be the phantom.

51:10.667 --> 51:13.469
Oh, good. They're gone.

51:13.503 --> 51:16.338
Heh. At least something
finally went the way
it was supposed to.

51:18.642 --> 51:21.177
I do this like
I'll actually
know something.

51:21.211 --> 51:22.878
I'm an English teacher!

51:22.913 --> 51:25.147
But, a car breaks
down and a guy
automatically

51:25.182 --> 51:26.515
looks under the hood.

51:26.550 --> 51:30.753
Ok, have I been macho
long enough now
to call the auto club?

51:30.787 --> 51:35.424
Yes, and then I'll call
the theater and give
the kids a heads-up.

51:35.459 --> 51:37.460
Karen: I hate this!
We shouldn't be here.

51:37.494 --> 51:39.228
We should be upstairs
waiting for mom.

51:39.262 --> 51:42.064
Shh. What if we find
the guy who got
trapped in here

51:42.098 --> 51:45.067
when they blew up
the original theater?

51:45.101 --> 51:47.536
What's that?

51:52.509 --> 51:53.642
I don't like this.

51:53.677 --> 51:56.111
I don't like this at all.
This is really scary.

51:56.146 --> 51:58.681
Come on, we should just go back.

51:58.715 --> 52:01.016
Come on! I hate this.

52:01.051 --> 52:03.552
Let's get out of here.
Let's just go! Come on!

52:07.123 --> 52:08.824
Whoa!

52:12.362 --> 52:13.996
Cool!

52:18.134 --> 52:19.168
Look at this.

52:19.202 --> 52:20.302
Wait!

52:23.240 --> 52:25.474
What are you doing?

52:28.011 --> 52:30.746
Whoa! We're
not dead, right?

52:30.780 --> 52:33.048
What are you talking about?

52:33.083 --> 52:35.885
Long tunnel,
bright light at the end.

52:35.919 --> 52:37.553
I just wanted to make sure.

52:37.587 --> 52:39.221
Come on, bri.
Let's get out
of here, please?

52:39.256 --> 52:41.891
Not till I know where this goes.

52:41.925 --> 52:44.093
Uhh...

52:45.128 --> 52:47.196
Oh! This is so frustrating!

52:47.230 --> 52:48.831
I call the theater,
and all I get

52:48.865 --> 52:50.633
is this pre-recorded
laundry list of options,

52:50.667 --> 52:52.034
none of which lead
to a human being.

52:52.068 --> 52:54.169
I call the box office,
and all I get is show times.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.805
Wait a sec. Does
your beeper have
a callback function?

52:56.840 --> 52:58.173
I don't know.

52:58.208 --> 53:00.576
If Pete called
from the lobby
earlier,

53:00.610 --> 53:02.177
the number should
still be in memory.

53:02.212 --> 53:03.979
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Here we are.

53:10.954 --> 53:12.555
City morgue.

53:18.295 --> 53:20.563
Hello?

53:20.597 --> 53:23.232
On the bench?

53:23.266 --> 53:25.367
Oh, the blue bench.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.202
Um, hold... hold on,
I'll check.

53:37.814 --> 53:39.882
Uh, it's... it's empty.

53:39.916 --> 53:42.484
Me? Oh, my name.

53:42.519 --> 53:44.019
I'm mark jefferies.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.689
Oh, hello, Mrs. Riley.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.891
Um, no, I haven't seen Pete.

53:48.925 --> 53:53.362
You want me to...
To find out where he is?

53:53.396 --> 53:56.432
Um, ok, could you...
Could you hold on?

53:56.466 --> 53:58.634
Ok, um, hold on.

54:06.343 --> 54:07.443
Hmm!

54:11.548 --> 54:13.649
Karen: Wow.

54:13.683 --> 54:17.019
Brian: Ohh... Look
at all this.

54:18.254 --> 54:20.489
Hmm. Yeah.

54:20.523 --> 54:21.490
I don't get it.

54:21.524 --> 54:23.926
Where'd all this stuff
come from?

54:23.960 --> 54:26.962
Maybe nobody knows about it.

54:26.997 --> 54:30.633
Man, some of this old stuff

54:30.667 --> 54:33.502
must be worth a fortune.

54:33.536 --> 54:36.338
Bri, are you totally
100% positive

54:36.373 --> 54:38.574
Mason can't possibly
be the phantom?

54:38.608 --> 54:41.744
Of course. Not even
a question.

54:41.778 --> 54:46.649
Ok... Then...
What about this?

54:49.419 --> 54:50.719
Whoa.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.060
Hello, children.

55:06.236 --> 55:11.106
I see you've discovered
m-movie my little hideaway.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.942
You... you left
the light on.

55:13.977 --> 55:16.779
That's what happens
with old age.

55:16.813 --> 55:21.350
Liver spots come, the mind goes.

55:23.853 --> 55:27.823
Mason, do you know
what's been going on
around here tonight?

55:27.857 --> 55:32.194
Crazy projectors,
flashing lights, um,
indoor tornadoes?

55:32.228 --> 55:34.196
It's not you, is it?

55:34.230 --> 55:37.199
You're not the phantom
of the megaplex, right?

55:44.140 --> 55:46.575
Children...

55:46.609 --> 55:48.944
Children...

55:48.978 --> 55:50.946
Children...

55:50.980 --> 55:54.717
When we arrive
in this world, magic
is all around us.

55:54.751 --> 55:58.654
You simply
have to see a baby
discover a butterfly

55:58.688 --> 56:03.859
or a toddler
splash in the bath
for the first time.

56:03.893 --> 56:05.961
Yet, as the years pass,

56:05.995 --> 56:09.665
simple pleasures
aren't quite so
simple to find.

56:09.699 --> 56:12.835
Myths and legends fall away.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.871
Santa's secrets are revealed,

56:15.905 --> 56:19.341
card tricks lose
their fascination.

56:19.375 --> 56:21.844
True wonder is hard to come by.

56:21.878 --> 56:24.313
But there's always...

56:26.182 --> 56:29.284
Magic at the movies.

56:31.588 --> 56:35.491
Pirate ships, bicycles that fly,

56:35.525 --> 56:39.361
angels earn their wings,

56:39.395 --> 56:43.465
beautiful women
marry handsome men,

56:43.500 --> 56:46.235
and we all learn...

56:46.269 --> 56:50.939
There's no place like home.

56:50.974 --> 56:54.176
To destroy that magic,
to shatter
those moments,

56:54.210 --> 56:56.745
to me is a sin so grave

56:56.780 --> 57:01.250
as to be almost
incomprehensible.

57:01.284 --> 57:05.621
If there
truly is a phantom,
my young friends,

57:05.655 --> 57:09.024
I assure you...

57:09.058 --> 57:14.596
It most definitely is not me.

57:22.539 --> 57:24.273
Has anyone seen Caitlin?
She's supposed to be

57:24.307 --> 57:26.742
hanging around
for the premiere,
but I can't find her.

57:26.776 --> 57:29.678
I don't know if
this is a sick
joke or what,

57:29.712 --> 57:30.679
but Shawn's gone again.

57:30.713 --> 57:32.214
And nedermeyer
just called again.

57:32.248 --> 57:34.049
They should cancel
this premiere.

57:34.083 --> 57:36.084
Seriously! I mean,
once I heard...

57:36.119 --> 57:39.454
Terri! All right,
this is the biggest thing that's
ever happened at the grand.

57:39.489 --> 57:40.722
No one's gonna cancel it.

57:40.757 --> 57:42.157
How're we doing
on clearing out the place?

57:42.192 --> 57:44.092
You mean emptying
the theaters?
Yeah.

57:44.127 --> 57:45.594
Well, lower level's done.

57:45.628 --> 57:47.462
This level,
<i>floodgate's</i> got
10 minutes left.

57:47.497 --> 57:49.164
<i>Martian mountain</i>
gets out at 11:15.

57:49.199 --> 57:50.532
Lacy's checking the rest.

57:50.567 --> 57:51.900
All right, well,
go check the bathrooms.

57:51.935 --> 57:52.935
All right.

57:52.969 --> 57:54.069
Woman: Oh...

57:54.103 --> 57:58.740
Oh, excuse me, children.

57:58.775 --> 58:00.509
Excuse me, will one
of you please tell me

58:00.543 --> 58:04.780
where I might find
your manager, um,
Shawn macgibbon.

58:04.814 --> 58:07.716
Um, Shawn?
Mm-hmm.

58:07.750 --> 58:10.552
Well, um, Shawn could
be just about anywhere
right now.

58:10.587 --> 58:12.855
May I help you? I'm
the assistant manager,
Pete Riley.

58:12.889 --> 58:16.558
And I, child, am
Ms. Tory Hicks. Perhaps
you've heard of me.

58:18.928 --> 58:22.431
Perhaps not.
In any case, I have
Ms. Madison Ashley Metz,

58:22.465 --> 58:25.934
Mr. Jacob Johnson,
and numerous other
very unhappy clients

58:25.969 --> 58:27.769
outside in their limousines,

58:27.804 --> 58:29.471
begging to know
when we will be getting

58:29.505 --> 58:31.406
this painfully amateur
show on the road.

58:31.441 --> 58:33.575
Soon, really soon, we promise.

58:33.610 --> 58:34.776
Oh, it had better be soon.

58:34.811 --> 58:36.578
My boy, if I don't receive

58:36.613 --> 58:38.714
a personal welcome
at my limousine

58:38.748 --> 58:41.350
from your, uh, oh,
Shawn macgibbon,

58:41.384 --> 58:42.684
I will be taking
all of my clients

58:42.719 --> 58:45.053
back to L.A.
before you can say
"heads will roll"!

58:49.359 --> 58:51.460
Pleasure meeting you, darling.

58:51.494 --> 58:55.097
Do give your manager
my message, hmm?

59:01.638 --> 59:03.472
You guys, Pete, hurry!

59:03.506 --> 59:05.774
Donny hollie's about
to pound the life
out of Ricky

59:05.808 --> 59:07.442
because Donny
pulled the laser sword
out of the meteor

59:07.477 --> 59:08.877
and now he wants
his free movie passes,

59:08.912 --> 59:09.878
but nobody can find Shawn,

59:09.913 --> 59:10.846
and Ricky's telling
Donny that...

59:10.880 --> 59:12.414
You'll get your stupid passes,

59:12.448 --> 59:13.782
but I can't give
them to you tonight!

59:13.816 --> 59:16.718
Then let me stay
for the premiere.
She gets to stay.

59:16.753 --> 59:18.654
Ricky:
She and Lisa
have tickets!

59:18.688 --> 59:21.690
We're all booked
out. There are
no more seats!

59:21.724 --> 59:22.925
So, I'll stand.

59:22.959 --> 59:25.994
Hello! Fire code
regulations.
Ever heard of them?

59:26.029 --> 59:28.030
We overbook and get
totally shut down.

59:28.064 --> 59:30.399
They don't care how
many Hollywood stars
are here.

59:30.433 --> 59:32.034
They'll cancel the whole event!

59:32.068 --> 59:34.536
How about you leave,
and I'll stay?

59:34.570 --> 59:36.204
Pete:
What are you
doing, Donny?

59:36.239 --> 59:38.507
You're running a contest.

59:38.541 --> 59:41.276
I won the contest,
and I want my prize.

59:41.311 --> 59:43.178
You'll get
your prize...
Tomorrow,

59:43.212 --> 59:44.413
but right now you gotta leave.

59:44.447 --> 59:46.715
Make me.

59:57.060 --> 59:58.160
I gotta deal with this, Donny,

59:58.194 --> 01:00:01.563
then I'll be back
to personally
toss you out.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.172
Folks, please, if you
would just listen to me.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:13.308
I am very, very sorry
the fire sprinklers
malfunctioned.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:16.178
Uh, you're welcome to fill out
complaints or refund forms,

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:19.047
but please, try and understand,
i have to clear the lobby.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:22.117
We have a special event
starting in a half an hour,

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:23.919
and I need
your full cooperation.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.657
Oh, man. mark, take over.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.792
You mean me? Ahh...

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.594
All right, folks,
I'm really, really sorry,

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:33.996
you're gonna have
to clear, please.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.231
We have this really, really
big... big premiere starting,
i...

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.499
Pete:
What are you
doing back?

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:38.500
Back? We never left.

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:39.634
What happened to mom?

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.670
We were hoping you'd tell us.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.438
She hasn't shown up yet?

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.708
No, but the good news
is, we've I.D.Ed
the phantom.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.012
It's merle!

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.880
Why would merle be the phantom?

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:54.116
Come on!
We'll show you.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.121
Brian:
Remember what he said up
in the projection booth

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.689
about being
under-appreciated,

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.724
everything's
too computerized,
all that junk?

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:05.060
Pete: Uh-huh.
Come on, hurry,
right this way.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.596
Well, Karen and me
came in here looking
for you and...

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:08.930
What happened
to the emergency
running lights

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:09.898
along the floor?

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.133
Wait...

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:20.909
Announcer: It started
as a movie, but now it's real!

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.645
This thing, this trailer,

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.847
it's been running over
and over in here.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:28.350
Who else but merle
could rig up something
like this?

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.751
Who else but him
could do any
of it?

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.186
Brian said
the lights
and projectors

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.320
are tied
to the computers
up there.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.189
Yeah, but merle's
not gonna risk his job

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:36.825
to do something
stupid like this.
He's been here forever.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.126
Maybe that's the problem.

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:39.494
Maybe he finally wants

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.129
to be appreciated
and recognized.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.331
Like Willie gaines
in <i> the last woodcarver?</i>

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.802
Maybe you two guys have
seen way too many movies.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:48.537
Announcer: Mischief...

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:56.571
On the other hand,
i don't think it would hurt
to check merle out.

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:09.991
Annohey! What are you doing
it sover there, phantom?

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.195
Excuse me?

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.496
I'm really sorry, merle.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.365
My slightly demented
little brother has
himself convinced

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.967
you're the phantom
of the megaplex.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:21.369
Hey, catch this.
He's still got

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.637
that creepy trailer
playing down there.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.774
Uh, no, actually,
I'm workin' my buns off

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.509
trying to shut
the darn thing down.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.944
What's the problem?
I thought you were

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.245
a master at all this stuff.

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:31.980
Brian! You're
being really rude!
Now will you cool it?

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:35.350
The fact is, I don't know
how this trailer got
onto my reels,

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:39.154
and I can't figure out
how it's programmed
to keep repeating.

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.922
A likely story.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.727
Listen, kid. If you
don't back off

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:47.429
and give me a chance
to sort this out,

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:48.630
we're not gonna have a premiere,

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:49.931
because I won't be
able to run the prints!

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:53.068
Which conveniently
makes you look
like a big hero

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:54.302
for getting it
all fixed in time!

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.370
Karen and Pete: Brian!

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.873
Come on. We got
our guy right here.

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.808
Why don't you two
wanna do anything
about it?

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:00.909
Uh, Brian?

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.110
No, listen to me!

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:03.345
Brian, look!

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.958
Whoa. He's...
Real.

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.094
Well, duh.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.529
Come on!

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.737
Ok, so, I was wrong.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.206
Love to stay and help
you fix the computer
and everything,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.975
but I'm pretty sure
Pete needs me more.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.612
Karen: Yeah, you
really called
it, huh, bri?

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.247
Yeah, it's definitely merle.

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:41.183
Great job.
Nobody's home.

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:43.552
Brian: I don't see you
coming up with any
brilliant answers.

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.719
Uhh!

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.925
Pete:
All right,
i surrender.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.726
Maybe you guys with all
your movie knowledge

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.261
do know more
about this than I do.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.931
So, how are we gonna
find out who the phantom
really is?

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.266
Ok, we need
to apply
cinematic logic.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.801
Is anybody around this place

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.670
hooked up to the Internet?

01:04:03.072 --> 01:04:05.307
It's a major megaplex
about to host
a major premiere.

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.509
Wouldn't you think
that somebody would
pick up a ringing phone?

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.377
He said he'll be
done in 5 minutes.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.012
George, you
don't understand.
I'm never late.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.847
Those kids must
think I'm in a ditch
somewhere.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:15.650
If they were worried,
wouldn't they have
beeped you?

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.285
You're right, they must be dead.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.588
Why else wouldn't
i have heard
from them by now?

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.191
I'm really trying
to follow this.

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.360
You need to use
Shawn's computer why?

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:29.030
Listen, everything
the phantom's done
so far tonight

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.132
had to do
with the movies
playing

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.467
in the theaters he's attacked.

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.569
Now, if we wanna know what he's

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:35.770
got planned for the premiere,

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:38.740
we've gotta
find out the plot
of <i> midnight mayhem.</i>

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:40.642
Ok, nobody knows that.
That's the whole deal.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:43.044
I mean, they've been
keeping the story
top secret.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.346
Isn't he cute when he's naive?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.682
Ever heard of
spoiler sites
on the Internet?

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.552
Let me just tell
you, a movie
geek's paradise.

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:53.722
Every secret
Hollywood has,
these guys know.

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:59.160
Shawn?

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.140
Whoa!

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:17.612
Don't you wish how all
this creepiness was
near the end, sweetie?

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:21.516
It's way stressing
not knowing
who's doing it.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.090
What the heck was that?

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:30.892
It came from in there.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.833
Hillary: Hello?

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.069
Is, like, anybody in there?

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.909
It's the phantom.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:50.045
What do we do?
I don't know!

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:55.250
Come out or we'll
call the police!

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.218
Both: Aah!
Please don't
call the cops!

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:59.054
My mom would so ground me.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.855
I didn't even want
to stay! I swear.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.357
It was all April's idea.

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:04.459
Relax. We were only trying
to crash the premiere.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.561
Well, you and everybody
else in town.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.330
But without a ticket, no go.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.532
Told you, April.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.170
I came up to call nedermeyer,

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:17.005
I was jumped
from behind... Again,

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:19.307
I was blindfolded,
handcuffed,
and hung on the door

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.642
like a bag of dry cleaning.

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:23.578
Well, if the phantom's
not movie Mason
and it's not merle,

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.447
then we're running
out of suspects.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:29.584
Here you all are. Great.
Nedermeyer's limo's
on the approach.

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:34.889
Ahem. Nedermeyer
is to know nothing

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:35.890
of our troubles here tonight.

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.325
Are we clear?
Yes, sir.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.228
Good. We are going
to act as if everything
is absolutely perfect,

01:06:40.262 --> 01:06:42.397
while praying that it
actually will be.

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:43.932
Pete!

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:47.836
Uhh, uhh!

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.237
This way.

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.106
Ah, Mr. nedermeyer!

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.341
Welcome, welcome, welcome, sir.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:56.878
How glorious
to have you here
this evening,

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.814
along with your entourage.

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:04.819
And Mr. Tyler jesseman.
I, um...

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.824
What an honor.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.193
What a thrill.
I... i have not missed

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.795
a single one of your films, sir.

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:18.166
<i>Crow catchers,</i>
<i>dead and gone...</i>
classics, classics!

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.003
Hello, lamonica.

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:24.472
Are you as thrilled
about this evening
as we are, sir?

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:27.208
All preparations
proceeding apace,
mcgreavey?

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:30.245
Macgibbon, sir,
and yes, they are.

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:32.514
We could not possibly
have it more under control.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.351
Lacy?

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.153
Lacy, no!

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:54.035
At the big climax,
the mayhem monster

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.104
traps a bunch of kids
in the school auditorium,

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.806
then starts growing so big

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.208
he completely sucks
the air out of the place.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.209
Oh, yeah, that should be

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.911
real easy for our
phantom to pull off.

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.979
Well, you know
he's gonna try
something like it.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.881
Come on.
Let's go warn Pete.

01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:20.261
Wait your turn!
Sorry, sir.

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.934
All right,
maccarthy...
Macgibbon.

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:27.502
Since you don't have any answers

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:30.537
as to why our balloons
became water balloons,

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.740
perhaps you can answer this.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.408
Who told you to remove

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:37.912
the incredibly expensive
mayhem monster
from my roof?

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.818
I didn't remove it, sir.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.185
It's up
there... Still.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.220
Exactly the way
you wanted it
to be.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:48.957
And I'm telling you,
that 10 minutes ago

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.892
when I came in, it wasn't there!

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.694
Pardon me!
Lamonica:
Whoa!

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:58.299
Ah, Wolfgang. I am
simply stopping in
to say good-bye.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:01.069
Ms. Tory Hicks!

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:03.304
The woman who
brought the tinsel
to tinseltown.

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.973
Of course you know
Tyler jesseman.
Yes.

01:09:05.006 --> 01:09:06.447
Good-bye? What do
you mean, good-bye?

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.142
Just because I call
my people cattle

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:10.377
does not mean they
can be treated as such.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.113
We've been outside
cooling our heels

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:14.415
in the limos
for 3 quarters of an hour.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.216
Are you opening
these doors or aren't you?

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:21.756
All right, mcgreavey.
You heard Ms. Hicks.
Open those doors now!

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:25.059
I'll see if I can
find out what happened
to that monster.

Entertaining
your neglected
guests.

01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:20.431
Listen here,
you freakshow,
i could have sworn

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.834
I told you to keep away
from here this evening.

01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:26.004
Is there a problem?

01:10:26.038 --> 01:10:27.972
Stay out of this, lady.

01:10:29.942 --> 01:10:30.909
Crowd: Ooh!

01:10:30.943 --> 01:10:31.943
Reporter: Ms. Ashley Metz!

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.211
Second reporter: Ashley,
over here, Ashley!

01:10:33.245 --> 01:10:35.346
Crowd: Ohh!

01:10:36.548 --> 01:10:41.219
I... it's... you're,
um, you're her.

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:46.291
Can I introduce
my friend to you,

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.792
Ms. Madison
Ashley Metz?

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:53.164
Oh... You... you two...

01:10:53.198 --> 01:10:54.899
What, you... you
know each other?

01:10:54.934 --> 01:10:56.434
This is her hometown.

01:10:56.468 --> 01:10:58.803
She virtually
grew up
in this theater.

01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:02.206
In fact, movie Mason
was the very first one

01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:04.008
who encouraged me
to become an actress.

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:05.510
Oh...

01:11:05.544 --> 01:11:08.446
Swell. I, uh, i...

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.015
If you'd be a sweetie
and open the doors,

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.952
my escort and i
are more than ready

01:11:13.986 --> 01:11:16.788
to go in and take our seats.

01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:25.196
Reporters: Ashley! Ashley!

01:11:29.935 --> 01:11:32.603
Excuse me. I know
that my timing
couldn't be worse.

01:11:32.638 --> 01:11:35.039
Um, I'm Pete Riley's
mom, and I don't
want to get in

01:11:35.074 --> 01:11:36.307
to see the premiere,
i really don't.

01:11:36.342 --> 01:11:38.509
I just desperately
need to find
my kids.

01:11:55.494 --> 01:11:56.995
Pete!

01:11:57.029 --> 01:11:59.364
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.265
Brian found out
the <i> midnight mayhem</i> climax.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.701
Well, guess what?
Now the giant
monster balloon,

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:04.802
the one from the roof?

01:12:04.837 --> 01:12:06.971
It's gone and nobody can
find the roof level key.

01:12:07.006 --> 01:12:08.206
Wait a minute!

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.907
Could this be it?

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:39.103
Karen: Why would anyone
steal a balloon that's
bigger than a house?

01:12:39.138 --> 01:12:41.139
Where would you hide it?

01:12:41.173 --> 01:12:42.774
What would you do with it?

01:12:42.808 --> 01:12:43.841
Yeah, well, they totally

01:12:43.876 --> 01:12:45.243
had to let the air out of it

01:12:45.277 --> 01:12:46.577
to get it down from here.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.312
You know, guys, I'm really sorry

01:12:48.347 --> 01:12:50.715
I haven't taken
your opinions
more seriously tonight.

01:12:50.749 --> 01:12:52.617
Tonight?
You never do.

01:12:55.921 --> 01:13:00.258
Ok, well, maybe I've
just been so wrapped up
with work and stuff

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:02.760
that I haven't bothered
to notice that you two
are growing up to be...

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.128
Incredibly intelligent?

01:13:04.163 --> 01:13:05.897
Amazingly
good-looking?

01:13:05.931 --> 01:13:07.899
A pretty impressive team.

01:13:07.933 --> 01:13:11.402
I hate to say this,
but I probably could
learn a few things

01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:13.204
from hanging out with you guys.

01:13:13.238 --> 01:13:15.673
Well, duh.
We're the funnest
people you know.

01:13:17.443 --> 01:13:19.877
Aw, come here.

01:13:23.582 --> 01:13:24.849
Pete: Ohh!
Brian: Aah!

01:13:24.883 --> 01:13:26.951
Karen: What's going on?
Ow! What's happening?

01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:29.954
Hey, ouch!
What's that?

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:31.756
Watch it!
Pete?

01:13:33.892 --> 01:13:35.226
What's going on?
Who's there?

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.529
What's going on?
Ow!

01:13:38.564 --> 01:13:46.564
What's happening?

01:13:57.549 --> 01:14:00.451
Great. I've seen
katey segal,
I've seen levar Burton,

01:14:00.486 --> 01:14:02.954
but I haven't
spotted a single one
of my own kids.

01:14:02.988 --> 01:14:06.224
Oh, wait, there's
somebody who might
be able to help.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.728
Hillary, Hillary.

01:14:10.762 --> 01:14:13.531
Hi, Julie Riley, Pete's mom.

01:14:13.565 --> 01:14:16.400
How are you, Mrs. r.?
I didn't know you
were coming tonight.

01:14:16.435 --> 01:14:17.735
Yeah, well, neither did I.

01:14:17.769 --> 01:14:19.804
Listen, I'm looking
for Pete's little
brother and sister.

01:14:19.838 --> 01:14:21.539
You wouldn't happen
to know where they
might be?

01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:23.274
The way things have been
going around here tonight,

01:14:23.308 --> 01:14:24.942
I couldn't even begin to guess.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:27.812
Ok.

01:14:27.846 --> 01:14:30.314
Pete: We have to shuffle
an inch at a time

01:14:30.349 --> 01:14:33.151
until one of us hits
that, uh, the pipe
with the valve.

01:14:33.185 --> 01:14:35.486
Karen: How do we know
we don't shuffle
right off the roof?

01:14:35.521 --> 01:14:37.955
Don't worry.
There are guard rails.

01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:40.491
Brian: Ok. I get that we're
looking for this valve.

01:14:40.526 --> 01:14:44.162
Now explain to me
what happens
once we find it.

01:14:44.196 --> 01:14:46.831
Look, you think you two
are the only movie buffs?

01:14:46.865 --> 01:14:49.467
This is like James Raymond
in <i> huey's cove.</i>

01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:53.104
Oh, yeah, exactly!
He's trapped in
the Fisherman's net

01:14:53.138 --> 01:14:55.406
but gets himself
to the coral reef.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.708
And uses it to open the net.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.278
Ok. We've gotta move right
to get to the pipe.

01:15:00.312 --> 01:15:02.213
Over... Over... Over.

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:03.714
Wait a minute...

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.750
Where is it?
Where's
the valve?

01:15:05.784 --> 01:15:08.219
Brian, get your elbow
out of... oh, wait!

01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:10.821
I found them!
I found the valve.
Ok, guys.

01:15:10.856 --> 01:15:13.558
We're gonna drop
right now. Ok...

01:15:16.562 --> 01:15:18.396
All: Whoa!

01:15:32.811 --> 01:15:34.879
Folks! Ahem!

01:15:34.913 --> 01:15:36.547
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:36.582 --> 01:15:40.151
could you take
your seats, please?

01:15:40.185 --> 01:15:43.187
Thanks. Everybody,
uh, take your seats.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.557
I would like to welcome you

01:15:46.592 --> 01:15:51.762
to what I know
will be an enjoyable
and exciting event.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:54.865
Since we're all
anxious to start,

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.468
let me introduce
the director of our film,

01:15:57.502 --> 01:15:59.904
Mr. Tyler jesseman!

01:16:11.783 --> 01:16:13.050
Ooh!

01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:14.552
Uh... Ha ha.

01:16:14.586 --> 01:16:16.921
Thank you very, very,
very, very much

01:16:16.955 --> 01:16:18.389
for being here.

01:16:18.423 --> 01:16:22.426
I know that some of you have
traveled a long way to do so.

01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:23.995
Um... The hour is late,

01:16:24.029 --> 01:16:26.397
so without further ado,

01:16:26.431 --> 01:16:29.900
let the mayhem begin!

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.108
No!

01:17:11.143 --> 01:17:13.177
Aah!

01:17:13.211 --> 01:17:15.379
Man: Go this way!
Let's go this way!

01:17:15.414 --> 01:17:16.814
Take hold of my hand!

01:17:19.351 --> 01:17:22.520
Go get the driver!
Enough is enough!

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:24.522
Man, is this getting old!

01:17:24.556 --> 01:17:26.991
Brian, get your elbow
out of my back!

01:17:27.025 --> 01:17:27.958
It's not me!

01:17:27.993 --> 01:17:29.160
Karen...
Sorry!

01:17:29.194 --> 01:17:31.295
Where is it?
Where's the valve?

01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:33.164
Looking for the...
Wait. Is that it?

01:17:33.198 --> 01:17:34.699
Yes! That's it!

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:36.634
This way! This way!

01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:38.336
Aah!

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:42.940
Oh!

01:17:42.974 --> 01:17:45.109
Down a little!
Down a little!

01:17:45.143 --> 01:17:46.544
Ok.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.816
Ok, I almost got it.
Almost got it.
I got it!

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:54.085
I got it. All right,
come on.

01:17:56.855 --> 01:17:58.489
Nice job, Pete.

01:17:58.523 --> 01:18:01.692
Thanks. But we've
still got to head off
the phantom's finale.

01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:05.529
You're positive it's him?

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:07.531
You're the ones
with all the clues.

01:18:07.566 --> 01:18:09.033
I just added them up.

01:18:09.067 --> 01:18:11.035
They've already gotten
to the scary parts!

01:18:11.069 --> 01:18:13.003
Man, this movie must rock!

01:18:13.038 --> 01:18:14.839
What do we do?
It's blocked!

01:18:14.873 --> 01:18:17.341
All right, let's go.
You want to solve
a problem,

01:18:17.376 --> 01:18:19.410
you gotta get
some perspective
on it.

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:20.644
Yeah, hurry!

01:18:25.183 --> 01:18:26.517
Help us!

01:18:26.551 --> 01:18:27.685
Whoa!

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.388
Holy schnitzel!

01:18:30.422 --> 01:18:33.357
What are we supposed to do now?!

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.694
May I offer a suggestion?

01:18:36.728 --> 01:18:38.429
Mason! Where did
you come from?

01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:41.365
I left miss Metz
to use the rest room,
and all heck broke loose.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.734
If you're willing
to take advice
from an old-timer,

01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:45.770
we might just be able
to save the day!

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.938
It won't come out, Mason.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.340
Keep at it, lad!

01:18:50.308 --> 01:18:52.009
Riley, what are you doing?

01:18:52.043 --> 01:18:53.911
I'm trying to pull
this thing out.

01:18:53.945 --> 01:18:56.180
But you know that only
happens every 10,000 tugs,

01:18:56.214 --> 01:18:58.949
and stupid Donny hollie
had it out an hour ago.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:01.919
Yeah, well, you can keep
pulling till your arms
fall off...

01:19:01.953 --> 01:19:03.287
Or you can do this.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.428
Thanks, bro.
Mason, let's go.

01:19:10.462 --> 01:19:12.863
Aah!
Aah!

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:19.069
Where do you suppose
the kids are
in all this?

01:19:19.104 --> 01:19:20.805
There's one of them!

01:19:22.874 --> 01:19:25.376
Geronimo!

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.310
Pete!

01:19:59.344 --> 01:20:00.845
Look!

01:20:04.182 --> 01:20:06.784
You go take care of that monkey.

01:20:20.499 --> 01:20:21.665
Hoo hoo hah hah!

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.339
Crowd: Oh!

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:45.155
Crowd: Whoa!

01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:48.259
Ah!

01:20:48.293 --> 01:20:50.995
Oh!

01:20:51.029 --> 01:20:53.497
Whoa!

01:21:07.012 --> 01:21:09.346
Ohh!

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:18.222
The only reason
I'm not arresting you
for malicious mischief

01:21:18.256 --> 01:21:20.524
is because
i still have a premiere
to get under way.

01:21:20.559 --> 01:21:22.459
But mark my words...

01:21:22.527 --> 01:21:25.829
I intend to ensure
that your life becomes
as miserable

01:21:25.864 --> 01:21:28.499
as you've made mine tonight.

01:21:28.533 --> 01:21:31.969
Not only are you fired
and banned from these
premises for life,

01:21:32.003 --> 01:21:34.471
but I'll ensure that you
never again work

01:21:34.506 --> 01:21:38.208
in any theater
in any city
in this state!

01:21:38.243 --> 01:21:40.210
Is that clear, mcnall?

01:21:40.245 --> 01:21:42.246
Macgibbon.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.882
Macgibbon! For once
in your life,
get it right!

01:21:44.916 --> 01:21:47.117
My name is... ding!

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:48.919
Shawn macgibbon,

01:21:48.954 --> 01:21:52.289
and I did all this
tonight just so you
would finally notice me!

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.458
But you don't care.

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:56.293
You've never cared.
Ha ha!

01:21:59.197 --> 01:22:01.865
You think lamonica
will be a better gm
than I will?

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:05.135
So be it.
But don't come
crying to me

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.105
when you find out
that you're wrong!

01:22:08.139 --> 01:22:10.240
Mr. macgibbon!

01:22:14.746 --> 01:22:17.247
You know
what I was saying
up on the roof

01:22:17.282 --> 01:22:19.383
about lightening up a little?

01:22:19.417 --> 01:22:20.651
That's a good thing, right?

01:22:20.685 --> 01:22:21.986
Yes!
Yes!

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.388
I'm 17, not 70.

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:26.590
I mean, aren't i
supposed to be
enjoying myself?

01:22:26.625 --> 01:22:27.758
Totally!

01:22:27.792 --> 01:22:29.793
And I know the perfect
way for you to start.

01:22:29.828 --> 01:22:33.731
You can talk mom
into letting Karen and me
stay for the premiere.

01:22:33.765 --> 01:22:35.232
Will you, Pete?
Please?
Please?

01:22:35.266 --> 01:22:36.767
Please?
Please?

01:22:36.801 --> 01:22:39.269
I'm telling you,
it'll write itself:

01:22:41.172 --> 01:22:43.107
<i>The Shawn macgibbon story.</i>

01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:46.377
You'll come to L.A.
we'll be partners.

01:22:48.179 --> 01:22:49.980
You mean it?

01:22:50.015 --> 01:22:51.482
Of course I do!

01:22:51.516 --> 01:22:53.751
And do me a favor, partner.

01:22:53.785 --> 01:22:56.920
Run and fetch me
a hot cup of coffee,
2 creams.

01:22:56.955 --> 01:23:00.457
I'll meet you
in the show.
I love ya!

01:23:06.698 --> 01:23:09.033
All we need now
is a 4-star
Hollywood ending.

01:23:10.201 --> 01:23:11.535
All right.

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:12.836
How 'bout this?

01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:19.443
Just because a plant is healthy,

01:23:19.477 --> 01:23:21.845
alone in its pot,

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.348
that doesn't mean
it's entirely
happy.

01:23:33.024 --> 01:23:34.958
Julie...

01:23:34.993 --> 01:23:37.494
If you'll have me,

01:23:37.529 --> 01:23:39.963
I would really love
to become a part

01:23:39.998 --> 01:23:41.665
of this amazing family.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.168
I... unfortunately,
i, uh,

01:23:44.202 --> 01:23:46.136
don't have a ring yet...

01:23:46.171 --> 01:23:49.540
Pardon me, sir.
May I offer you this loaner?

01:23:49.574 --> 01:23:52.876
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha...

01:23:52.911 --> 01:23:55.179
I have a lot of props around

01:23:55.246 --> 01:23:57.481
just in case of emergencies.

01:23:58.683 --> 01:23:59.717
Julie...

01:24:01.052 --> 01:24:02.686
Will you marry me?

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.428
How can I resist?

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:24.608
Ah, Mr. Riley,

01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.310
now...

01:24:26.344 --> 01:24:28.912
With Shawn gone
and lamonica
moving up,

01:24:28.947 --> 01:24:31.849
I'm going to need
a new senior
manager.

01:24:31.883 --> 01:24:33.917
Money, money.
Longer hours.

01:24:33.952 --> 01:24:35.185
What do you say?

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.621
Absolutely, sir.
I'd be honored.

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.762
But, uh...

01:24:44.796 --> 01:24:47.064
I'm afraid I have
to turn you down.

01:24:47.098 --> 01:24:48.766
Excuse me?

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.935
I'm sorry. I guess
what I figured out
tonight

01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:55.806
is that I need
to spend more time
having a life.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.875
In fact, Mr. nedermeyer,

01:24:57.909 --> 01:25:01.845
I'd, uh... Really like
the rest of the night off.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.615
I think I deserve it.

01:25:04.649 --> 01:25:07.384
Oh, you do, do you?

01:25:08.787 --> 01:25:11.655
Good! Because
i think so, too.

01:25:12.957 --> 01:25:15.993
Here. Take your girl
out to a lovely
breakfast

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:18.228
after the picture...
On me.

01:25:18.263 --> 01:25:20.931
You saved my skin
tonight, Riley.

01:25:20.965 --> 01:25:22.566
I appreciate it.

01:25:23.601 --> 01:25:26.270
All right, everybody,
let's go in

01:25:26.304 --> 01:25:27.838
and enjoy the show!

01:25:30.909 --> 01:25:33.143
Oh, lamonica!
Yes, we're gonna
use theater 2.

01:25:33.178 --> 01:25:36.313
I want you to run up
to the projection booth

01:25:36.347 --> 01:25:38.649
and tell merle.
Ok!

01:25:40.451 --> 01:25:43.086
Not that I'm...
In over my head here,

01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:46.623
but, uh...
Where the devil is
the projection booth?

01:25:51.162 --> 01:25:53.897
Ok, littles.
Say good night
to your brother.

01:25:53.932 --> 01:25:57.434
It's time to hit the road.

01:25:57.468 --> 01:25:59.303
Uh, actually, mom,
i was thinking

01:25:59.337 --> 01:26:02.372
it might be
really nice if you
let Brian and Karen

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:03.941
stay for the premiere.

01:26:03.975 --> 01:26:06.276
I know it's late,
but it's summer.

01:26:06.311 --> 01:26:09.479
Tomorrow they can
sleep in as long
as they need to.

01:26:09.514 --> 01:26:11.081
Besides...

01:26:11.115 --> 01:26:13.083
If it wasn't for
their detective work,

01:26:13.117 --> 01:26:16.019
we probably wouldn't
even have a premiere.

01:26:16.054 --> 01:26:18.288
What do you say?

01:26:18.323 --> 01:26:19.223
Please?

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.058
Yeah,
come on, mom.
Please?

01:26:21.092 --> 01:26:22.960
Tch. Oh...

01:26:22.994 --> 01:26:25.562
You're not afraid
they're gonna
cramp your style?

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.332
Are you kidding?
We're teaching him
style!

01:26:28.366 --> 01:26:29.633
Oh!

01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:31.268
Sad but true.

01:26:31.302 --> 01:26:35.038
Admit it, mom.
We all really need
to be together tonight.

01:26:35.073 --> 01:26:38.242
And what better place
for us than the movies?

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:41.178
He does have a point, hon.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:44.848
All right, all right, all right.

01:26:44.883 --> 01:26:46.550
We can stay?

01:26:46.584 --> 01:26:48.418
Yes! Come on.
Yes!

01:26:50.655 --> 01:26:51.955
Enjoy the show, sir.

01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:53.624
You enjoy the show.

01:26:53.658 --> 01:26:55.125
Enjoy the show!

01:26:55.159 --> 01:26:56.627
Ha ha ha!

01:26:56.661 --> 01:26:58.195
Enjoy the show.

01:26:58.229 --> 01:27:00.898
You know, as long
as I've been
around this place,

01:27:00.932 --> 01:27:05.035
I never really
believed in the phantom
of the megaplex.

01:27:05.069 --> 01:27:06.770
Now, the werewolf
of the megaplex...

01:27:08.072 --> 01:27:10.374
That's a different
story entirely!
