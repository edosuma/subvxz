[COMPUTER BEEPING]

15:39.607 --> 15:40.881
We are done here.

16:00.594 --> 16:03.632
I don't hear her heartbeat.

16:03.798 --> 16:06.904
NIGHTWING:
Twenty-eight, 29, 30.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.048
[BLOWING AIR]

16:17.011 --> 16:18.786
She's dead.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.152
BLACK MANTA: Congratulations,
Kaldur'ahm. You had quite a day.

16:47.808 --> 16:50.914
Capturing the Atlantean,
killing a former teammate...

16:51.078 --> 16:52.648
…destroying the Comsat.

16:52.813 --> 16:55.521
My crew did not destroy the Comsat,
Father.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.321
Its rocket must've malfunctioned.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.986
Our victory was mere luck.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.295
BLACK MANTA:
I don't believe in luck.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.526
Which is why I arranged
to have a bomb...

17:03.691 --> 17:07.229
with an altitude sensor smuggled
onto the Comsat rocket days ago.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.671
This was your final test.
To see if you would take credit...

17:10.830 --> 17:13.835
- …for what you had not accomplished.
- What if I had succeeded?

17:14.134 --> 17:16.272
BLACK MANTA:
Then another test would have awaited.

17:16.436 --> 17:20.180
For it is not in success
where true character is revealed...

17:20.507 --> 17:22.578
But in failure.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.951
I'm quite proud of you, my boy.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.723
You're ready for the next level.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.593
[MISS MARTIAN SOBBING]

17:48.035 --> 17:49.537
We'll find La'gaan.

17:49.703 --> 17:52.047
- And Aqualad.
- No doubt.

17:52.206 --> 17:54.550
Where's Nightwing? He should be here.

17:54.708 --> 17:55.982

17:56.310 --> 17:58.256

- Wally?

18:42.856 --> 18:44.961
I don't hear her heartbeat.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.938
I got you. Hang on.

18:54.335 --> 18:56.281
I take it our ruse was successful.

18:56.437 --> 18:57.973
Almost too successful.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.243
The Team and the League are in mourning.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.886
They may never forgive us.

19:02.042 --> 19:04.318
And still only we four know the secret?

19:04.478 --> 19:07.618
This secret and the other,
that you've been under deep cover...

19:07.781 --> 19:10.921
within Black Manta's organization
since leaving the Team.

19:11.085 --> 19:14.089
- How'd it go on that end'?
- Successful as well.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.894
I've proven my loyalty
to my biological father.

19:17.057 --> 19:20.004
He's moving me up the ladder,
bringing me closer to the Light...

19:20.160 --> 19:21.639
and their unknown Partner.

19:22.196 --> 19:24.403
<i>Not without cost, Kaldur.</i>

19:24.565 --> 19:27.205
The Comsat wasn't supposed
to be destroyed.

19:27.368 --> 19:30.474
And La'gaan definitely wasn't supposed
to be captured.

19:30.637 --> 19:34.244
It was the only way to save his life
and maintain my cover.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.410
NIGHTWING:
I'm not blaming you.

19:36.577 --> 19:40.650
I know you've been forced
to make impossible decisions.

19:40.814 --> 19:43.852
Like choosing between
saving the Kroloteans on Malina Island...

19:44.018 --> 19:45.759
Or saving my friends.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.297
And I will find a way to help La'gaan.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.163
- You have my word.
- So what now'?

19:56.063 --> 19:58.942

Physio-morphic spell, I think.

20:03.771 --> 20:05.307
She said it backwards.

20:05.472 --> 20:09.386
Wow, you look exactly the same.

20:09.543 --> 20:10.954
To the four of us.

20:11.111 --> 20:12.852
And only us.

20:13.013 --> 20:16.984
But to anyone else,
you're an entirely different person.

20:17.151 --> 20:21.156
[DEEPER VOICE]: The impressive trick is how
you got something so specific from Zatanna...

20:21.321 --> 20:24.393
[NORMAL VOICE]...without revealing who
or what it was for.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.467

- Dog.
