08:39.385 --> 08:43.688
See, above water,
I'm a nobody--

08:43.690 --> 08:45.990
Just another annoying cat.

08:45.992 --> 08:49.593
But down here,
I'm someone special,

08:49.595 --> 08:52.163
Someone who can
make people happy.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.865
And if making the world
a happier place

08:54.867 --> 08:56.901
Makes me a criminal...

08:56.903 --> 08:58.002
[crying]

08:58.004 --> 09:02.239
Then lock me up
and throw away the key.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.675
Have mercy!

09:04.677 --> 09:05.343
[whimpering]

09:05.345 --> 09:06.444
- All right, kenny,
all right.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.912
I promise I won't
tell anyone.

09:07.914 --> 09:10.081
- Really?
- Yes, really.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.549
- All right!

09:11.551 --> 09:12.350
Thanks, bub.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.219
You're the best friend
I ever had.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.755
Now if you'll excuse <i> moi,</i>

09:17.757 --> 09:20.825
I gotta sign some autographs.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.961
- Ah, the cat of the hour
is back.

09:23.963 --> 09:26.464
[cheers and applause]

09:26.466 --> 09:30.434
All right. You ready to sign
for these fine dollars--

09:30.436 --> 09:31.469
I mean, uh, suckers--

09:31.471 --> 09:33.337
I mean, uh,
some autographs.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.373
[cheers and applause]

09:35.375 --> 09:36.207
Well, all righty then.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.677
That's what the consuming public
wants to hear.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.112
- Sir, I just wanna say that

09:41.114 --> 09:42.213
You're the biggest inspiration

09:42.215 --> 09:44.014
Myself and my friends
have ever known.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.549
Your ability
to hold your breath

09:45.551 --> 09:47.918
Has changed our lives
forever.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.588
[all grunting]

09:51.456 --> 09:53.791
- "you're welcome.
I've been holding my breath

09:53.793 --> 09:55.626
"for more than 20 years,
no problem.

09:55.628 --> 10:00.364
You can too, signed
kenny the breath-holding cat."

10:00.366 --> 10:01.065
- Hi, kenny.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.466
Mind if I get your signature?

10:02.468 --> 10:03.934
Gee, it sure is nice
to meet another

10:03.936 --> 10:07.138
Air-breathing, warm-blooded
varmint down here.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.038
- Mm-hmm.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.107
- Just out of scientific
curiosity,

10:10.109 --> 10:12.743
How do you hold your breath
for so long?

10:12.745 --> 10:13.844
- Uh, we needn't
burden ourselves

10:13.846 --> 10:16.781
With such needless scientific
technicalities, sandy.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.482
- I'm just wondering,
spongebob.

10:18.484 --> 10:21.585
I mean, he does defy
all scientific logic,

10:21.587 --> 10:24.054
Considering the fact
that all air-breathing mammals

10:24.056 --> 10:25.990
Need oxygen
to the brain and lungs

10:25.992 --> 10:28.726
To survive for more than
three minutes.

10:28.728 --> 10:31.028
- Hey, maybe we should
show our fine guest

10:31.030 --> 10:32.630
A little more hospitality, hm?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.698
- What has gotten into you,
spongebob?

10:34.700 --> 10:37.435
Can't I talk about
what must surely be happening

10:37.437 --> 10:39.537
From a biological standpoint?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.539
I mean, like,
the lack of oxygen

10:41.541 --> 10:44.208
Will tighten the capillaries
in the lungs,

10:44.210 --> 10:46.811
Causing a dangerous level
of carbon monoxide

10:46.813 --> 10:49.880
To rise in the bloodstream,
which in turn

10:49.882 --> 10:52.750
Leads to a ghostly blue color
to the skin,

10:52.752 --> 10:55.719
Followed by
eventual unconsciousness.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.988
- I can't take it!

10:57.990 --> 11:01.725
I need oxygen!

11:03.328 --> 11:04.662
[all gasp]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.363
[inhales deeply]

11:06.365 --> 11:07.665
Ahh.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.867
- I knew kenny was a fake.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.069
[all grumbling]

11:12.071 --> 11:13.304
- Liar!

11:13.306 --> 11:14.672
- No! Come back.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.509
Ah, thanks a lot,
you air-breathing charlatan.

11:18.511 --> 11:23.380
And you can forget about
these free condiments too.

11:23.382 --> 11:24.315
- Gee, kenny.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.884
I sure am sorry
if I ruined your career.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.819
- Aw, it's okay, spongebob.

11:28.821 --> 11:32.356
Maybe the whole shamble
is a big wake-up call

11:32.358 --> 11:34.191
To be honest.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.659
- Hey, I got an idea.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.561
Most cats hate water, right?

11:37.563 --> 11:40.064
Well, you can be the cat
that likes water.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.066
That way,
you're still special.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.934
- I like it!

11:43.936 --> 11:46.437
- Just get out of here
already.

11:46.439 --> 11:50.875
You can never trust a cat--
or is it a dog?

11:52.000 --> 11:58.074

12:03.755 --> 12:05.122

12:05.124 --> 12:07.258
[mumbles]

12:07.260 --> 12:08.526
[snoring]

12:08.528 --> 12:10.594
- Squidward!
- Aah!

12:10.596 --> 12:11.428
What is your problem?

12:11.430 --> 12:14.131
- My problem is that
you aren't working,

12:14.133 --> 12:17.268
Which means I lose
m-u-n-e-e,

12:17.270 --> 12:20.838
Which means you lose
your j-o-b.

12:20.840 --> 12:21.605
- Remind me again.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.008
Is that good news
or bad news?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.376
- Tentacles, I mean it.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.012
You get back to mindin'
that register.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.180
- Minding it
for which customer?

12:30.182 --> 12:31.515
[crickets chirping]

12:31.517 --> 12:32.316
- I see your point.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.051
But still,
I'm not paying you

12:34.053 --> 12:36.086
To dream sweet nothings.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.254
Do something.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.923
Pick up a mop, a broom,

12:38.925 --> 12:41.659
A window wiper,
a spatula even.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.328
- Spongebob's
got that covered.

12:44.330 --> 12:50.000
- [humming]

12:52.470 --> 12:54.004
[gasps]
dust specks on the window!

12:54.006 --> 12:57.107
Don't worry, boss man,
I got it covered.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.909
[squeegee squeaks]

12:58.911 --> 12:59.710
That's better.

12:59.712 --> 13:03.614
Ooh, sounds like the dishes
are done soaking.

13:05.884 --> 13:06.584
[humming]

13:06.586 --> 13:10.321
- That's a perfect example
of what I'm talking about--

13:10.323 --> 13:11.755
Stayin' busy.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.925
- I was busy, trying to forget
about this place

13:14.927 --> 13:16.026
Till you woke me up.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.762
- Okay, have it your way,
squidward.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.130
Since you can't be bothered

13:20.132 --> 13:21.799
To take
the initiative yourself,

13:21.801 --> 13:25.302
It's clear I must
assign tasks to you.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.938
Hm. Mr. Squidward,
scrub the walls

13:27.940 --> 13:31.375
Of the krusty krab
till they gleam.

13:31.377 --> 13:34.912
- Already done, sir.

13:35.914 --> 13:37.648
- Oh, well,
that's very nice, boy.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.049
Thank you.
But, you see,

13:39.051 --> 13:41.251
I'm trying to give squidward
a task.

13:41.253 --> 13:44.655
- Hm. Well, the smoke duct
needs sweeping.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.890
- Excellent idea,
mr. Squarepants.

13:46.892 --> 13:50.194
Squidward, I'd like you
to sweep--

13:50.196 --> 13:52.363
[banging]

13:52.365 --> 13:53.631
- Done and dusted.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.498
[wheezes]

13:54.500 --> 13:58.669
- Nice working conditions,
but no thanks.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.670
- Ooh, is that so?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.639
Perhaps you'd prefer
scraping the gum

14:01.641 --> 14:03.374
Off the underside
of these tables.

14:03.376 --> 14:07.578
- Oh, a restaurant employee
handling chewed bubblegum?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.847
That's gotta violate
a lot of health codes.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.150
- Not if you wear gloves,
it doesn't.

14:13.152 --> 14:16.153
Mind if I take this to patrick
after work, mr. Krabs?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.255
- I guess spongebob
has a handle

14:18.257 --> 14:19.690
On all the krusty krab duties.

14:19.692 --> 14:24.128
Which leaves you with
all the extracurriculars--

14:24.130 --> 14:26.530
Like shining me shoes.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.732
- Sorry. All out of polish.

14:28.734 --> 14:30.834
- But I'm not.

14:30.836 --> 14:35.372
- Wash me boat!

14:35.374 --> 14:38.776
- [singing]

14:40.178 --> 14:40.978
- Listen, squidward.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.380
I'm gonna get a full day's work
out of you,

14:43.382 --> 14:44.415
One way or another.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.017
- It doesn't matter what
you want me to do,

14:47.019 --> 14:48.519
I won't do it.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.520
- [growls]

14:49.522 --> 14:51.288
[chuckles]
oh, yeah?

14:51.290 --> 14:52.056
Fine.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.490
If you refuse to work,

14:53.492 --> 14:56.260
Then I can't
be held responsible.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.563
- Responsible for what,
mr. Krabs?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.265
- For...

15:01.267 --> 15:03.200
For...

15:03.202 --> 15:09.106
A visit from the yeti crab!

15:09.108 --> 15:11.275
- [gulp]
the yeti crab?

15:11.277 --> 15:11.809
- Yeah.

15:11.811 --> 15:15.245
Everybody's heard
of the abominable yeti crab--

15:15.247 --> 15:20.117
With his long white hair
and six-pack abs

15:20.119 --> 15:22.319
And yellow teeth.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.821
And everybody knows
that he only

15:23.823 --> 15:26.090
Comes out
of his mountain cave

15:26.092 --> 15:30.427
To feed on lazy workers.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.529
He's attracted to the scent.

15:32.531 --> 15:36.266
He can smell your lazy,
lazy stench

15:36.268 --> 15:39.236
From hundreds of miles away.

15:39.238 --> 15:39.937
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

15:39.939 --> 15:41.438
Oh, wait.
What am I worried about?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.974
I'm a hardworking
self-motivated sponge.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.110
- Yes, but that won't
make any difference.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.646
Because of your proximity
to squidward's laziness,

15:49.648 --> 15:52.449
You will be eaten.
- [gasps]

15:52.451 --> 15:55.252
Squidward and I are as close
as brothers.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.053
- Ludicrous.

15:56.055 --> 15:56.954
- You won't think so

15:56.956 --> 16:00.657
When that big hairy feller
wants to eat ya.

16:00.659 --> 16:01.825
[chuckles]

16:01.827 --> 16:03.994
Yeah, now listen up, boys.

16:03.996 --> 16:06.797
Boss man krabs is steppin' out
for a minute,

16:06.799 --> 16:09.299
But I want
this tub of laundry done

16:09.301 --> 16:10.901
Before I get back.

16:10.903 --> 16:11.435
Or--

16:11.437 --> 16:14.705
- Or the yeti crab will
smell our laziness and eat us.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.939
- Precisely.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.708
See ya, boys.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.408
- Whatever.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.777
- Squidward,
what are you doing?

16:19.779 --> 16:22.379
[sniffs] oh, no. Your lack
of work is taking on an odor.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.915
- You're sure it's not
these you're smelling?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.583
- If the yeti crab
catches wind of it,

16:26.585 --> 16:30.687
He's gonna, you know,
eat us.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.089
- Oh, come on, spongebob.

16:32.091 --> 16:36.260
Krabs's yeti story
is a complete and total crock.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.227
- [gasps]
squidward!

16:37.229 --> 16:39.530
Mr. Krabs would never
make up something like that.

16:39.532 --> 16:43.300
- You can believe in
whatever garbage you want to,

16:43.302 --> 16:45.169
Just do it away from me.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.372
Now run along and
wash krabs's undies.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.074
- You got it, squidward.

16:52.377 --> 16:56.280
Anything to keep
that yeti crab at bay.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.618
[tumbling]

17:10.194 --> 17:12.628
- [sniffs, grunts]

17:15.700 --> 17:18.101
[sniffs]

17:18.103 --> 17:20.304
[roars]

17:21.906 --> 17:23.607
[sniffs]

17:28.079 --> 17:31.048
[sniffs, growls]

17:34.586 --> 17:37.054
- Let me out of here,
you hairy brute.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.823
I can find my own food.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.459
- [growls]

17:42.461 --> 17:44.094
[sniffs]

17:44.096 --> 17:46.396
[chuckles]

17:47.165 --> 17:49.533
- Good day, sir.
Are you yeti to order?

17:49.535 --> 17:50.601
[yelps]

17:50.603 --> 17:51.835
Oh, squidward!

17:51.837 --> 17:53.203
- What, what, what?
Huh?

17:53.205 --> 17:54.738
- You are not
gonna believe this.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.506
There's a yeti crab
at table seven,

17:56.508 --> 17:58.942
And he is sniffing out
the lazy.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.777
- [chuckles]
of course he is.

18:00.779 --> 18:01.812
Nice costume, eugene.

18:01.814 --> 18:05.449
Couldn't you at least
had it dry-cleaned or pressed?

18:05.451 --> 18:07.885
- [roars]

18:07.887 --> 18:09.953
- Didn't brush this morning,
did we?

18:09.955 --> 18:11.622
- Please don't eat us,
mr. Yeti.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.489
We're not lazy.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.825
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Oh, boy.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.026
I'll have to work
twice as hard

18:16.028 --> 18:18.896
To make up for
squidward's laziness.

18:21.499 --> 18:23.233
[chuckles nervously]

18:23.235 --> 18:24.368
A wobbly table?

18:24.370 --> 18:27.838
Oh, we can't have that.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.042
[grunts]
come on.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.710
No. Here.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.379
- [growls]

18:35.381 --> 18:38.782
- There, perfect.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.416
Yikes!

18:39.418 --> 18:41.919
Time to top off the mustard.

18:45.256 --> 18:47.190
[grunting]

18:47.192 --> 18:47.991
See, I'm busy.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.593
I'm organizing
the spice racks...

18:49.595 --> 18:51.528
By color.
- [grunting]

18:51.530 --> 18:55.098
- Ooh.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.567
- [sneezes]

18:58.770 --> 18:59.937
- I guess
while I'm down here,

18:59.939 --> 19:02.706
I'll hit the ol'
grease traps again.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.675
[grunting]

19:10.581 --> 19:13.483
Ahh.

19:15.286 --> 19:16.219
- [sniffs]

19:16.221 --> 19:19.957
- Aah! I'm not lazy.
Don't eat me.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.025
- [roars]

19:22.027 --> 19:24.661
- I'm sorry, mr. Yeti crab.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.362
- [sighs]

19:25.364 --> 19:29.399
I almost feel sorry
for the little nimrod.

19:30.234 --> 19:31.902
What the--
do you mind?

19:31.904 --> 19:34.471
- Sorry, squidward,
just varnishing the ceiling.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.274
- Oh, I hope you're happy,
mr. Krabs.

19:37.276 --> 19:38.575
You're driving him insane.

19:38.577 --> 19:39.676
- [growls]
- yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.945
You'll eat me if I'm lazy,
whatever.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.147
- [roars]

19:44.149 --> 19:46.683
[welding sparks]

19:46.685 --> 19:50.253
- Not the home and garden
section!

19:50.255 --> 19:51.555
Spongebob?

19:51.557 --> 19:52.489
- Huh?
Oh, sorry.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.758
Just making sure all the rivets
are securely welded.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.161
- Spongebob,
we have no customers today.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.863
Ergo, we have nothing to do,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.932
No matter what that buffoon
wants you to think.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.034
- [shushes]
squidward, he might hear you.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.502
Don't worry, mr. Yeti crab.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.337
We have plenty to do.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.972
I can replenish
the toilet paper.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.674
And redecorate
mr. Krabs's office.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.810
And refold the napkins
into origami figures.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.045
Knit straw cozies.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.114
Clean the soap.
Replane the grill.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.716
Washing inside the walls.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.719
Sucking up every dust particle
in the restaurant.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.288
[vacuum whirring]

20:25.290 --> 20:27.724
- Have you lost it, spongebob?

20:27.726 --> 20:28.692
- Lost it?

20:28.694 --> 20:29.793
[laughs nervously]

20:29.795 --> 20:33.797
Lost it?
What a silly thing to say.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.366
Aah!

20:36.368 --> 20:37.000
- [sighs]

20:37.002 --> 20:41.138
Guess I'm down
to the comics section.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.607
- Squidward!

20:43.609 --> 20:44.374
You were right.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.343
There's no more work to do.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.646
I have done it all...

20:49.648 --> 20:50.947
- [roars]

20:50.949 --> 20:55.152
- Which means
he is gonna eat us!

20:55.154 --> 20:56.887
- That does it.

20:56.889 --> 21:01.058
I have had it
with this ridiculous ruse.

21:03.194 --> 21:07.697
Using fear to prey
on a feeble mind.

21:07.699 --> 21:12.235
Even spongebob
doesn't deserve that.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.971
Enjoy spooking the witless,
eh, krabs?

21:14.973 --> 21:18.909
Well, we'll just see
how you like it.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.644
[grunts]

21:20.646 --> 21:21.745
- [growling]

21:21.747 --> 21:22.379
- [roars]

21:22.381 --> 21:26.883
See? I can dress up
as a convincing yeti crab too.

21:26.885 --> 21:29.386
- [roars]

21:29.388 --> 21:31.721
- T-t-two yeti crabs?

21:31.723 --> 21:35.025
[whimpers]

21:35.027 --> 21:35.692
[grunts]

21:35.694 --> 21:38.695
- Take off that phony suit,
mr. Krabs.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.697
You're not fooling anybody.

21:40.699 --> 21:42.232
- I'm back, fellers.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.733
- Sorry, mr. Krabs.
I'm a little busy

21:43.735 --> 21:46.970
Trying to pull off
this stupid mask of yours.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.071
- Uh, squidward?

21:48.073 --> 21:49.940
- What? Oh.

21:49.942 --> 21:53.443
[screams]

21:56.414 --> 21:59.149
- We're as good
as yeti food.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.517
I blame squidward.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.720
- Guys, do you hear that?

22:03.722 --> 22:05.689
- You mean the sound
of my own flesh

22:05.691 --> 22:06.756
Sizzling to a crisp?

22:06.758 --> 22:10.360
- No, I'm talking about
the sound of a hungry customer.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.329
He doesn't wanna eat us
for being lazy.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.232
He wants to eat us
because he's hungry.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.435
Fellas, leave this to me.

22:25.877 --> 22:28.879
- [sniffs]

22:28.881 --> 22:30.213
[chuckles]

22:30.215 --> 22:31.648
- Way to go, boy.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.083
He loves it.

22:33.085 --> 22:33.917
[cash register dings]

22:33.919 --> 22:36.153
And look,
he's a paying customer.

22:36.155 --> 22:39.656
Come back and see us anytime,
mr. Yeti crab.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.325
Hey, what are you two doing
standing idle?

22:42.327 --> 22:44.694
Squidward, scrape out
the crow's nest.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.096
- No.
- Done.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.098
- Refinish me floors.
- No.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.566
- Done.
- Build me a new safe.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.568
- Nuh-uh.
- Consider it done.
