00:01.200 --> 00:02.717
Previously on
Stargate Atlantis.

00:02.881 --> 00:07.197
I believe I had a vision last night.
I saw Kanaan, the father of my son.

00:07.480 --> 00:09.780
Save us.
- Where are you?

00:10.880 --> 00:14.435
I came for you, just like you asked.
- Like I asked.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.836
Michael...
- I was the one in your visions.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.958
I was sent back in time?
- In fact, you were sent forward.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.195
I've loaded all the intel we got on Michael
after your disappearance,

00:24.358 --> 00:26.476
including the address
where we found Teyla.

00:26.639 --> 00:31.661
Quickly. You must release me.
- Teyla?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.836
Whoa!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.677
John!
- I know where Teyla is.

00:36.841 --> 00:41.796
My child is of no concern to you.
- I have great plans for him.

00:41.960 --> 00:42.913
I think we're too early, though,

00:43.076 --> 00:44.557
but he's going to bring her here
to have the baby.

00:44.721 --> 00:48.309
Colonel, it's a booby trap!
We've gotta get out of here now!

01:01.360 --> 01:03.794
This is perfect. Just what I needed.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.635
It truly has been a hectic several weeks.

01:07.798 --> 01:11.956
Try four years.
- Very true.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.635
In a way, it makes these calmer moments
even more special.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.352
I cherish these times,
when it is just you and me.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.180
Me, too.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.554
You... You've got an early morning.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.269
I never got to properly thank you.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.340
For what?
- "For what"? For rescuing me.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.076
From Michael.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.791
I never gave up hope, because I knew.
I knew that you would come for me, John.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.300
I know this sounds crazy, but

01:53.000 --> 01:57.953
I don't remember rescuing you.

01:58.116 --> 02:01.433
You don't remember rescuing her
because you didn't,

02:01.597 --> 02:03.897
just like you never rescued me.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.580
Sheppard! Hey, buddy.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.996
What happened?
- Michael's compound, it collapsed on us.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.660
Hey.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.232
I think I...
- Yeah, hold on, let me take a look.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.780
Oh...

02:44.200 --> 02:48.715
What the hell was that?
- Just a little scrape, no big deal.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.953
What about the others?
- I don't know. We got separated.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.420
Try them on the radio.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.156
There's no signal.
There's too much interference.

03:05.320 --> 03:09.516
I'm pretty sure my leg is broken.
- Yeah, I think I'm remarkably fine.

03:09.679 --> 03:11.317
Well, isn't that wonderful?

03:11.481 --> 03:14.079
That brings me great comfort. Thank you.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.717
I don't think we're that deep.
I can see daylight.

03:18.881 --> 03:20.876
If I can just...

03:21.040 --> 03:23.340
Ow! Ah!

03:25.240 --> 03:26.997
I'm sorry!
- I just posted Edison

03:27.160 --> 03:29.552
at the entrance to the building.
He'll get help.

03:29.716 --> 03:32.597
That is, assuming he wasn't hit
by falling debris.

03:32.761 --> 03:34.753
Doc, the Daedalus left Atlantis

03:34.917 --> 03:37.312
while we were still confirming
Sheppard's story.

03:37.476 --> 03:40.118
With that kind of a head start,
they should be here in less than

03:40.281 --> 03:43.796
three hours, so one way or the other,
help is on the way.

03:43.959 --> 03:47.156
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm not good in tight spaces.

03:47.320 --> 03:52.438
Look, there's no bad guys around, okay?
No bad guys, just a lot of debris,

03:52.601 --> 03:56.595
so if you could please just sit tight
and try not to make the ceiling collapse,

03:56.758 --> 03:58.434
that would be great.

03:58.598 --> 04:02.633
Okay, no bad guys. Just sit tight.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.514
When did you get this?
- Moments ago.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.780
Change of plans.
We're setting a new course.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.039
Our compound has been compromised.

06:43.280 --> 06:48.262
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation!
It's Lieutenant Edison's IDC.</i>

06:51.320 --> 06:52.678
What happened?
Where's the rest of your team?

06:52.841 --> 06:55.557
There was a massive explosion.
Everyone was in the main compound.

06:55.721 --> 06:57.314
The whole building imploded on itself.

06:57.478 --> 07:00.197
Were there any survivors?
- Radios are down. I don't know.

07:00.361 --> 07:01.598
I just thought I should get back here, and...

07:01.761 --> 07:04.996
No, you did the right thing.
Get him to the Infirmary.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.513
How far away is the Daedalus?
- Still two hours out.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.795
We can't wait that long.

07:08.959 --> 07:11.757
Have the combat engineers gear up,
and have Dr. Keller ready her away team.

07:11.921 --> 07:14.221
Yes, ma'am.

07:24.040 --> 07:24.993
What are you doing?

07:25.156 --> 07:27.036
I'm claustrophobic.
I'm trying to keep my mind busy,

07:27.200 --> 07:30.476
which is hard because, you know,
it's my mind.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.596
Yeah.

07:31.759 --> 07:34.398
Well, there's no way anything useful
survived that implosion.

07:34.561 --> 07:37.155
Speak for yourself.
- You know what I mean, Doc.

07:37.318 --> 07:38.957
Look, I found a bunch
of computer parts, all right?

07:39.121 --> 07:40.634
The motherboards are all fried or snapped,

07:40.798 --> 07:42.793
but some of these hard drives
look like they might still be intact.

07:42.957 --> 07:47.236
If I could just get the power to...
Hello, hello.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.077
Whoa.
- What, is it something good?

07:49.241 --> 07:53.660
I don't know. There's a lot
of information. Hold on.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.754
I think I just hit the jackpot.
- What, some way to broadcast a signal?

07:57.917 --> 08:00.797
Let people know our location?
Speed up the rescue, what?

08:00.961 --> 08:02.836
No, although in hindsight,
I would say you're right,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.557
that should probably
be considered the jackpot,

08:04.721 --> 08:07.597
but no, this is a hard drive.
I can only access what's on it.

08:07.761 --> 08:08.753
Which is?

08:08.916 --> 08:11.797
It's Michael's wiki.
It survived the explosion.

08:11.961 --> 08:13.757
The what?
- Michael's database.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.637
There's a large chunk of it,
maybe the whole thing, too.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.156
I mean, we've got base schematics,
medical research information,

08:19.320 --> 08:21.313
list of planets.
Do you know what this means?

08:21.477 --> 08:23.596
Yeah, it means we're still stuck here,

08:23.759 --> 08:25.078
and I still have a broken leg.

08:25.241 --> 08:26.834
Yeah, in the short term,
but if we get out of here...

08:26.998 --> 08:28.275
If?

08:28.438 --> 08:30.738
We'd have him on the run.
He'd be finished! Look, if Michael...

08:32.120 --> 08:33.916
Oh, no.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.033
What?

08:35.196 --> 08:37.794
Look, I don't want to concern you
any more than you actually already are,

08:37.957 --> 08:39.634
but if I'm reading this correctly,
then Michael is...

08:39.798 --> 08:41.756
Shut up.
- No, no, you shut up. This is important.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.314
If Michael is...
- Shh! Quit making noise!

08:45.320 --> 08:47.620
It's footsteps.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.394
Okay, revise that. Start making noise.

08:49.558 --> 08:51.793
Hey! Down here!
- Hey!

08:51.956 --> 08:53.554
We're down here!
- Help!

08:53.718 --> 08:55.277
Help!
- Hey!

08:55.441 --> 08:57.741
Help! Hey!
- Hey! Help!

09:02.440 --> 09:06.275
Peters!
- Yeah, bring them straight through.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.756
All right, we've got four life signs
in two different locations.

09:10.919 --> 09:13.219
First two should be right beneath us.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.877
Listen...
- - Hey! We're down here!

09:16.041 --> 09:17.636
Down here!

09:17.800 --> 09:20.100
Hey! Hey, hey! Down here!

09:20.280 --> 09:23.515
McKay? Is that you?
- Oh. Thank God. Yes!

09:23.679 --> 09:25.354
I'm trapped down here with Lorne!

09:25.518 --> 09:27.434
Are you okay?
- We're fine!

09:27.597 --> 09:29.636
Hey, Doc.
- Right, right, right.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.100
Okay, Lorne's got a broken leg.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.438
All right, McKay, stay put.
We've got combat engineers here.

09:35.601 --> 09:38.713
We're gonna dig you out.
- Well, hurry up!

09:38.876 --> 09:42.193
We'll work as fast as is safe, Rodney!
-No, no, no. You don't understand.

09:42.356 --> 09:45.157
I just found out that
when the self-destruct is initiated,

09:45.321 --> 09:48.075
it's automatically programmed
to send a subspace burst.

09:48.238 --> 09:49.957
Michael's probably already on his way.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.874
It's doesn't look like they're too far down.

09:52.037 --> 09:54.203
We should be able to get them out
inside of an hour.

09:54.357 --> 09:58.878
Well, what about the other two?
- They're a lot deeper.

09:59.041 --> 10:02.673
Well, the Daedalus will be here soon,
so then we can just beam them out, right?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.956
As long as Michael doesn't get here first.

10:05.119 --> 10:07.997
All right, let's get started!

10:08.161 --> 10:11.117
Rivers, take a Jumper into orbit
and keep a lookout for Michael's ship.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.708
Let me know the second he gets here.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.191
Right, yeah, right through here.
I got it.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.918
Okay. One, two, three...

10:43.840 --> 10:45.394
This thing ain't moving.

10:45.558 --> 10:47.394
I wonder what happened to the others.

10:47.557 --> 10:49.037
I don't know.

10:49.201 --> 10:52.274
It happened pretty quick.
I doubt that many people made it out.

10:52.437 --> 10:54.636
So stupid.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.276
Of course the building was booby trapped.
I should have seen that coming.

10:58.439 --> 10:59.997
Yeah, well, none of us did.

11:00.161 --> 11:02.595
Yeah, but I'm the guy.

11:02.759 --> 11:04.956
You know, like, "the guy. "

11:05.119 --> 11:07.236
Everyone knew what we were getting into.

11:07.399 --> 11:10.474
We all knew how dangerous it was,
so don't beat yourself up about it.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.996
You need to start thinking about
how to crawl your way out of here.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.834
No way.

11:15.998 --> 11:19.074
I'm serious. You just keep moving up,
keep moving the debris.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.196
Work your way up.

11:20.359 --> 11:22.834
I'm not leaving you behind, Sheppard.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.355
I'm not trying to be a hero here.
It's a selfish thing.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.633
I need you to dig a hole

11:34.797 --> 11:37.638
so that the rescuers
can come down and get me.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.153
That's the wrong way, chief.

11:42.317 --> 11:46.075
We get this beam off you, we get you free,
we dig ourselves out together.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.276
Deal?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.553
You ain't going to listen to me
one way or the other, are you?

11:50.717 --> 11:54.441
Great. Deal.
- Hmm.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.276
Excellent.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.740
This is all very good.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.397
Your son should be making
an appearance any day now.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.194
I thought that would make you happy.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.273
I can't imagine carrying a child
inside of you is very comfortable.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.673
I will not harm him.
Why can't you just accept that?

12:24.836 --> 12:30.556
Because I know you.
- All these worlds filled with people,

12:30.720 --> 12:32.756
busying themselves
with their pathetic lives.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.956
They come and they go,
they live and they die,

12:35.120 --> 12:38.709
and the galaxy is no better for it.
But your son...

12:39.720 --> 12:42.678
Your son will be an instrument of change.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.717
He will be remembered for the ages.

12:47.881 --> 12:49.756
And what of his mother?

12:49.920 --> 12:53.589
You speak often of his future,
but never of mine. Why is that?

12:56.680 --> 12:58.980
I had hoped that you would...

13:01.600 --> 13:04.160
I had hoped that you would understand...
- It's time.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.595
Very well.

13:08.758 --> 13:12.235
Remove the restraints
and post a guard outside this door.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.879
I must escape before our child is born.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.159
He will kill me once I am of no use to him.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.237
I can't.
- Kanaan, why?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.700
It is too dangerous.
- For who?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.276
He will kill us.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.878
Kill us all.

13:34.041 --> 13:36.598
Yes, he will, whether you help me or not.

13:36.761 --> 13:39.678
You are disposable to him.
Can you not see that?

13:42.920 --> 13:45.220
Listen to me.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.796
Kanaan!

13:48.960 --> 13:51.260
Please! Please!

14:03.320 --> 14:04.954
All right.

14:05.118 --> 14:06.917
Come over here.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.356
I'm fine. It's just a...
Just a couple of scrapes.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.636
Wow, Rodney McKay
refusing medical help.

14:11.799 --> 14:12.915
Now I really know
there's something wrong.

14:13.079 --> 14:16.396
Seriously, I'm okay.
Just... You should look after Lorne.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.073
Any survivors?
- We found two other life signs,

14:22.236 --> 14:23.754
but they're buried under
a lot more debris than you were,

14:23.918 --> 14:25.238
so it's going to take a little longer.

14:25.401 --> 14:26.718
We've got people working on it.

14:26.881 --> 14:30.916
Know who it is?
- Not yet.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.875
Rodney, did you find Teyla?
- No.

14:34.038 --> 14:35.278
No, but I think Sheppard was right.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.673
He was going to bring her here.
We just... We came too soon.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.115
Colonel Carter.
- Go ahead.

14:39.278 --> 14:42.476
Ma 'am, a Wraith cruiser
just came out of hyperspace.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.940
Michael's here.

14:50.680 --> 14:55.354
Multiple life signs.
It must be the Atlanteans.

14:55.517 --> 14:57.673
They're combing the debris,

14:57.837 --> 15:00.951
but they must know
it's too dangerous to stay here.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.980
They're searching for survivors.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.439
This might not be a total loss after all.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.432
Everyone fall back to your Jumpers!

15:11.596 --> 15:13.896
Hurry, let's go!

15:16.040 --> 15:18.340
We got incoming!

15:33.200 --> 15:34.313
Good shot.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.878
All right, let's fall back to our Jumpers.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.432
We've still got men trapped down here.
- They're gonna have to wait.

15:38.596 --> 15:39.955
We're no good to them
out in the open like this.

15:40.118 --> 15:42.418
Let's go! Fall back!

15:49.640 --> 15:51.940
Cloak the ship.
- Got it.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.834
We're getting a reading.
The gate's been activated.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.115
It's a classic Wraith battle technique.

15:58.279 --> 16:00.476
They dial the gate, lock everyone out,
make sure they can't escape.

16:00.639 --> 16:03.315
Well, it's a good one.
- Yeah, well, they're not idiots.

16:03.478 --> 16:04.393
We've got more Darts on the way,

16:04.556 --> 16:06.197
and they've already got troops
on the debris field.

16:06.361 --> 16:07.678
They must know
we've got people down there.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.796
How many Jumpers do we have?
- Three, including this one.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.315
I'm reading over 20 Darts.

16:11.478 --> 16:12.878
But they can't see us, though, right?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.874
Well, not right now,
but we can't fire while we're cloaked.

16:15.037 --> 16:17.917
Look, it's going to take them time
to dig them out, the same as us.

16:18.081 --> 16:21.271
We wait for the Daedalus.
Rodney, take us into orbit.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.675
Darts reporting minimal resistance.

16:27.839 --> 16:29.354
They've already started
searching the debris.

16:29.518 --> 16:31.994
We must work fast. I need them alive.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.917
There it is.
Is that Michael's cruiser?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.073
Well, it looks like it.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.914
Does that mean that Teyla's on that ship?

16:46.078 --> 16:47.435
It's possible.

16:47.598 --> 16:49.114
Well, that's great, though, right?

16:49.278 --> 16:51.353
When the Daedalus shows up,
we can just beam her up, too, no?

16:51.517 --> 16:53.756
It's not as easy as that.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.076
Chances are Michael's already
removed her transmitter,

16:56.239 --> 16:57.276
and even if he hasn't,

16:57.439 --> 17:00.753
Wraith cruisers surround themselves
with an electromagnetic jamming field.

17:00.917 --> 17:06.460
No beaming in, no beaming out.
- We're so close.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.435
Hey.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.900
Come on, one more try.
- Mmm.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.395
I'm feeling pretty weak, buddy.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.473
You're not quitting on me yet, are you?

17:19.637 --> 17:21.276
No.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.318
Uh. Well,
I was thinking about it.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.758
That wasn't part of our deal.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.116
You keep adding things
to this deal of ours.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.580
All right. Ready?

17:33.920 --> 17:37.799
One, two, three...

17:46.120 --> 17:50.996
Ronon!
You need to get out of here.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.555
Would you leave me
if I was stuck under there?

17:53.719 --> 17:56.019
Yes.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.196
You hear that?
- What?

18:00.360 --> 18:02.660
It sounds like digging.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.660
Yeah, I hear it.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.515
I hear it.
- Hey! Hey, we're down here!

18:11.360 --> 18:13.794
We're coming for you!
Just stay calm!

18:14.440 --> 18:16.740
And you were gonna quit.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.916
Status?
- Reading another ship in orbit.

18:30.079 --> 18:30.993
It's a Wraith cruiser.

18:31.156 --> 18:32.877
Shields up. Ready forward beam weapons.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.757
Sir, I'm receiving a coded transmission
from Colonel Carter.

18:35.921 --> 18:36.956
Sam, what's going on?

18:37.119 --> 18:40.875
Long story short, that's Michael's
cruiser, and he likely has Teyla onboard.

18:41.039 --> 18:42.395
So I can't blow him out of the sky?

18:42.558 --> 18:44.858
No, I'm afraid not.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.395
We're taking fire, sir. Shields are holding.

18:48.559 --> 18:50.952
They managed to get their shields up
before we hit them.

18:51.116 --> 18:53.076
That's unfortunate.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.595
Transfer power to the hyperdrive.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.798
What about the Darts?
- Acceptable losses.

19:07.720 --> 19:08.716
He's running.

19:08.879 --> 19:10.517
Not if I can help it. Target his hyperdrive.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.981
Yes, sir.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.518
We've lost hyperdrive.

19:25.681 --> 19:29.269
Well, I guess we're fighting after all.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.395
Shields are down to 80%.

19:42.558 --> 19:44.995
Daedalus, we still have two people
on the planet.

19:45.159 --> 19:47.515
It is just a matter of time
before the hybrids reach them.

19:47.679 --> 19:49.979
Can you scan for transmitter signals?

19:50.200 --> 19:52.500
Stay calm. We're almost there.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.157
I'm gonna stop making fun
of combat engineers as of today.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.436
I promise.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.900
Harris up there with you?

20:02.440 --> 20:05.671
Yes, he's here.
Don't worry, we'll have you out soon.

20:07.560 --> 20:10.472
I thought Harris was on leave
until next month.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.435
If we get out of here, beer's on me, boys.

20:20.080 --> 20:24.551
What do you like, Duff Beer or Oprah Ale?

20:27.160 --> 20:28.556
Duff.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.191
Well, they don't watch The Simpsons
or drink beer.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.036
Michael's hybrids?

20:36.200 --> 20:39.158
I bet he was tipped off
when the building blew.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.913
I told you, you should have
gotten out of here.

20:42.077 --> 20:43.796
Yeah, whatever.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.260
I can't reach my gun.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.100
Here.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.919
All right, how do you want to play this?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.909
Shoot till we can't shoot anymore.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.340
All right.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.620
Been a pleasure.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.060
Same.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.673
We got them.
It's Colonel Sheppard and Ronon.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.117
Can you beam them up?
We'd have to drop our shields.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.156
I kind of think that'd be
a bad idea right now.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.958
Look, if Michael gets his hands
on them, he'll kill them.

21:39.121 --> 21:41.421
We don't have a choice.

21:43.360 --> 21:44.755
All right, get ready to drop the shields.

21:44.918 --> 21:46.557
As soon as they're down,
beam Ronon and Sheppard directly

21:46.721 --> 21:47.915
to the Infirmary.
- Yes, sir.

21:48.079 --> 21:50.393
Sam, you might as well bring
your Jumpers onboard at the same time.

21:50.556 --> 21:52.856
Understood. We're in position.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.460
All right. Do it.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.834
We got them! Jumpers are in the bay.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.298
Shields up!

22:16.520 --> 22:19.235
Enemy vessel has raised shields again,

22:19.398 --> 22:20.957
but we scored several direct hits.

22:21.121 --> 22:23.421
Keep firing!

22:28.040 --> 22:30.718
How are we doing?
- Not so good.

22:30.881 --> 22:32.953
We lost sublight, hyperdrive
and Asgard weapons.

22:33.117 --> 22:35.512
Life support's down to 50%.
- What about the shields?

22:35.676 --> 22:39.713
Well, they're holding for now,
but we're basically dead in the water.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.380
Don't touch me.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.795
We thought we'd lost you there.

22:48.958 --> 22:51.957
Yeah, well, for a second,
I thought we'd lost me.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.596
It's going to be okay, though, right?

22:55.759 --> 22:57.993
Yeah. You need some serious work,

22:58.156 --> 23:02.477
but you should, you know,
live to fight another day and all that.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.073
So, what's going on?

23:06.236 --> 23:09.756
I guess Michael showed up
before the Daedalus.

23:09.919 --> 23:13.037
Yeah, we had to lower the shields
to beam you up here.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.837
Sorry about that.

23:15.001 --> 23:18.037
Well, I'm sure McKay and
Colonel Carter will be able to fix it.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.236
McKay's alive?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.556
Yeah.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.633
Yeah, he and Lorne were the only two
to make it out of the rubble.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.517
Patch me up. I need to get back out there.

23:28.681 --> 23:33.196
What? No, no, no. Look, you will be fine,
but you're far from it now.

23:33.360 --> 23:37.275
You've lost a lot of blood.
You need surgery and a transfusion.

23:37.438 --> 23:38.758
I mean, this can't wait.

23:38.921 --> 23:40.956
Look, Doc, Michael's here.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.719
That means Teyla's probably on the ship.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.915
I'm too close to sit here and do nothing.

23:47.079 --> 23:48.557
You're not gonna be
sitting around doing nothing.

23:48.721 --> 23:50.836
You're gonna be laying here in surgery.

23:50.999 --> 23:53.153
Okay, there's got to be, like...
There's got to be a quick fix.

23:53.317 --> 23:54.877
No.
- I need a few hours.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.597
I'm sorry. I can't.

23:56.761 --> 23:58.436
Look!

23:58.600 --> 24:03.034
I have had the chance
to rescue a teammate before,

24:03.197 --> 24:07.119
and it slipped through my hands.
I am not letting that happen again.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.153
Nice one.

24:16.316 --> 24:17.435
Of course.

24:17.599 --> 24:19.077
Life support's still not working
at full power,

24:19.241 --> 24:21.873
but at least we won't freeze to death.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.754
Well, I've almost got sublight back online,

24:24.917 --> 24:26.397
but the way these guys
are taxing our shields,

24:26.561 --> 24:28.952
we won't have any power
to spare anyway.

24:29.116 --> 24:30.917
We need to take out
the cruiser's main weapons.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.637
Yeah, with what?

24:32.801 --> 24:34.836
We could launch a 302 attack.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.300
That's what I was thinking.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.993
Colonel. Dr. Keller said
you were out of commission.

24:40.156 --> 24:42.873
She revised her diagnosis.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.233
Look, we may have an idea.

24:46.397 --> 24:48.697
Maybe a way to get Teyla back.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.596
We need to take out
the cruiser's main weapons.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.956
Easiest way for us to do that right now
is to launch an attack with 302s.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.518
I wouldn't exactly call that easy.

24:58.681 --> 25:00.317
They'll just send out Darts
to intercept them.

25:00.481 --> 25:01.436
That's what we're counting on.

25:01.599 --> 25:03.876
In order to launch the Darts,
they'll have to open the bay doors.

25:04.039 --> 25:05.438
If we have a cloaked Jumper in place,

25:05.601 --> 25:07.593
a small team should be able to
sneak onto the cruiser undetected.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.515
Find Teyla, bust her out,
and blast our way home.

25:10.678 --> 25:14.233
As a rule, I like to keep daring rescues
down to one a day.

25:14.396 --> 25:15.914
Look, shields are already down to 20%.

25:16.078 --> 25:19.396
It's just a matter of time
before they fail completely.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.753
She's over there, Steven, counting on us.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.380
I won't take no for an answer.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.833
All right, take a cloaked Jumper.
Radio us when you're in position.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.954
John, what really happened
in the Infirmary?

25:41.117 --> 25:42.596
Nothing.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.113
So you're telling me if I go down there
right now and talk to Jennifer,

25:45.276 --> 25:46.874
she'll tell me that you're fit for duty.

25:47.038 --> 25:48.235
I'm just trying to do the job.

25:48.399 --> 25:49.473
So am I,

25:49.636 --> 25:51.357
and part of my job
is determining whether or not

25:51.520 --> 25:53.396
you're going to be a liability
on this mission.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.118
Colonel, I have more respect for you

25:56.281 --> 25:58.114
than any commanding officer
I've ever had,

25:58.277 --> 26:01.073
but I'm getting on that Jumper,
end of story.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.318
I'll surrender for court-martial
when I'm done.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.554
You know, Ronon and I
could probably handle this.

26:23.718 --> 26:26.240
Maybe you should stay with the Jumper.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.140
Or not.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.952
Daedalus, we're in position.
Confirmed.

26:33.116 --> 26:35.416
Launch 302s.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.236
302s are approaching.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.700
Cue the Darts.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.197
It's closing.
- I see that.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.661
It's closing quickly.
- I got it.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.620
Daedalus, we're in.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.875
It worked. Cruiser just lost main weapons.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.719
Let's hope that
Sheppard has the same luck.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.836
All right, this won't take more than
a couple of seconds.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.740
That's troubling.
- What?

27:46.240 --> 27:48.715
Michael's a lot further ahead with
his repairs than I would have thought.

27:48.879 --> 27:51.113
The hyperdrive is almost back online.
We gotta make this quick.

27:51.276 --> 27:54.077
What do you mean, "quick"?
- Well, like, 15 minutes is not a lot of time.

27:54.241 --> 27:55.797
No, that's not a lot of time,

27:55.961 --> 27:58.315
so why don't you tell us
where Teyla is already?

27:58.479 --> 28:00.394
Right. Right, right, right.

28:00.557 --> 28:02.234
Got it. Okay.

28:02.398 --> 28:04.316
Follow me.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.780
Or you.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.073
John?

28:20.236 --> 28:22.276
We're gonna get you
out of here!

28:22.440 --> 28:24.740
Not a moment too soon.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.876
We gotta get you back
to the Jumper.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.396
You okay?

28:32.560 --> 28:35.317
It's my baby.
- What? Is something wrong?

28:35.481 --> 28:38.996
No, I've been having contractions
for over an hour now.

28:39.159 --> 28:41.459
They're very close.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.460
My baby's coming.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.311
I'm sorry.
I just need a moment.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.917
I'd carry her, buddy,
but I'm not really up to it.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.198
Yeah, okay. You ready?
- No, I can walk.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.556
I just need a moment.

29:09.720 --> 29:13.356
Say, friends, we have a small issue here.
- What now?

29:13.519 --> 29:15.237
Looks like Michael's got
his hyperdrive back online.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.313
It's powering up.

29:16.476 --> 29:18.277
Can you shut it down?
- Not from this little thing.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.715
Look, the drive room
is just down the corridor.

29:19.878 --> 29:23.913
You slap a C4 charge on that thing,
it should certainly shut it down.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.980
Where?
- Here. I have a map.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.109
All right. Ronon, you're with me.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.797
I'll be right back.
Everything's gonna be fine.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.220
You take care of her.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.500
So, how you doing?

29:51.760 --> 29:54.358
The pain is very great.
- Oh, yeah.

29:54.521 --> 29:57.158
Yeah, I had a kidney stone once.
Incredibly painful.

29:57.321 --> 29:59.878
Same kind of thing, from what I'm told,
so I hear you.

30:00.041 --> 30:01.837
Actually, my cat and I
had one at the same time.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.557
We were not fun to be around.
I'll tell you that much.

30:03.721 --> 30:05.357
He got his 'cause he was
eating too much of the dry cat food.

30:05.521 --> 30:07.396
I got mine 'cause I wasn't
drinking enough liquids.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.473
That's why you always see me hydrating.

30:08.636 --> 30:11.118
I have no desire to experience
that kind of pain again. It's just...

30:11.282 --> 30:12.715
Fascinating story. Thank you.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.116
Yeah, it's no problem.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.580
Okay, just... Just breathe, okay?

30:20.680 --> 30:22.474
What are you doing?
- Lamaze. It's supposed to help with...

30:22.637 --> 30:24.937
Look, I don't know what I'm doing.
What do you need me to do?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.875
Okay, there, there. There you are.
There, there.

30:29.038 --> 30:29.953
The baby is coming.

30:30.116 --> 30:32.113
You just hang on. We'll get you
to the Infirmary on the Daedalus,

30:32.277 --> 30:34.236
and Keller can pull it out.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.874
No, the baby is coming now.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.479
It's almost powered up.
- Give me your C4.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.156
Here, give it to me.
- I got it.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.238
Give it to me.
You don't have to do everything.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.113
All right, you ready? Let's go.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.515
All right.
Let's hope we're far enough away.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.274
Yeah, we'll see.

31:30.438 --> 31:32.738
Fire in the hole.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.315
What happened?
The hyperdrive just exploded.

31:41.478 --> 31:42.878
No, that's impossible.

31:43.041 --> 31:44.714
Main power is out
across much of the ship.

31:44.878 --> 31:47.597
An accidental overload?
- It doesn't appear that way.

31:47.761 --> 31:49.195
How did they do that?

31:49.358 --> 31:51.658
I will look into it.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.260
They're onboard.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.154
How did they get onboard?

31:57.318 --> 31:58.276
Well, can't you just hold it in?

31:58.439 --> 31:59.758
No, Rodney!

31:59.921 --> 32:01.956
This doesn't happen this quick.
No one has babies this quick.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.516
My water broke quite a while ago.
I've been trying to...

32:08.720 --> 32:10.434
Oh. I can see its head!

32:10.598 --> 32:12.833
That's good. That's a good thing, Rodney.

32:12.996 --> 32:15.355
Yeah, but am I supposed to touch it?
Am I allowed to touch you down there?

32:15.519 --> 32:17.593
I don't know what to do!
- Rodney, calm down.

32:17.757 --> 32:19.115
I need you to be calm.

32:19.278 --> 32:20.874
But I'm not an M.D.
I've never been an M.D.

32:21.038 --> 32:23.076
People have been having babies
for thousands of years,

32:23.240 --> 32:25.154
most of them without doctors.
- Yeah, but before doctors

32:25.317 --> 32:26.755
the infant mortality rate
was incredibly high.

32:26.918 --> 32:27.993
It was something like one in three, I think.

32:28.156 --> 32:30.276
Look, a doctor is a very important part
of this process.

32:30.439 --> 32:33.157
Trust me.
- Rodney! There are no doctors around.

32:33.321 --> 32:36.078
You have to do this!
We don't have a choice.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.835
Okay, okay.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.633
Now, you need to catch him.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.115
Catch him?
- Yes.

32:43.279 --> 32:45.353
You need to catch him
when I push him out.

32:45.517 --> 32:48.040
Oh, God. Okay, well, just...

32:49.200 --> 32:51.154
Underhand him, all right?
I've never been good at baseball.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.617
Rodney...

32:54.120 --> 32:56.276
Please.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.957
Okay, I can do this.

32:58.121 --> 32:59.874
All right, look,
I may have panicked a little back there,

33:00.037 --> 33:01.634
but we're going to do this.
We're going to do this.

33:01.798 --> 33:03.075
I am great with kids.

33:03.238 --> 33:04.797
The little ones,
the ones that don't talk back.

33:04.961 --> 33:07.261
Here he comes.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.315
Okay, almost there. Almost there.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.380
I caught him! I caught him!

33:27.520 --> 33:29.820
He's a boy.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.237
Watch his head.
- Right, right. Okay, little guy.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.700
Okay. Look at him.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.196
Do I get the cord?
I can cut the cord, then, right?

33:40.360 --> 33:43.636
Yeah.
- Okay, there you go.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.957
There, okay. So... Okay.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.997
Teyla, I'd like to introduce you to your son.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.634
I caught it!
It didn't hit the floor or anything.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.036
He did a wonderful job.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.998
That's good. You did good, Rodney.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.514
All right, we...
We gotta get you out of here.

34:17.678 --> 34:20.949
Ronon, you're gonna need to help me.
- Right.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.435
Why isn't it de-cloaking?

34:36.599 --> 34:37.795
Let me see. Did you break it?

34:37.958 --> 34:40.235
No, no.
We parked the Jumper right here.

34:40.399 --> 34:42.699
Yes.
-100%.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.580
Someone stole the Jumper?

34:46.120 --> 34:47.398
This is not good.

34:47.561 --> 34:50.159
I told you, you should have stayed here.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.511
How the hell are we supposed
to get off this ship now?

35:04.520 --> 35:07.075
I just delivered a baby.
That's not enough for today?

35:07.239 --> 35:09.116
Don't they have escape pods
or things like that

35:09.280 --> 35:11.580
on a cruiser?
- No, they...

35:11.880 --> 35:13.956
Wait, I know.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.638
I need to get back to a data terminal.
A lot of their internal power's down.

35:16.802 --> 35:19.634
Maybe I can short out the jamming code.
We can get the Daedalus to beam us out.

35:19.798 --> 35:22.098
Great, lead the way.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.740
Don't shoot! Put me down.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.874
It's all right, John. This is Kanaan.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.780
He is the father.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.140
This is our chance.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.348
These are the friends I told you of.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.518
They can help you get back
to your old self,

36:10.320 --> 36:12.620
but first, you have to help us.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.380
We must get off this ship.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.196
Do you know a way?

36:18.360 --> 36:20.556
Yes.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.036
Follow me.
No offense, Teyla,

36:23.199 --> 36:25.499
but I don't trust this guy.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.598
He has tried to save me before. I trust him.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.460
Give me your weapon.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.340
What's your plan?

36:46.640 --> 36:49.518
Sir, we've got a Dart trying to hail us.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.756
What?

36:51.920 --> 36:54.220
Let me hear it.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.715
This is Colonel John Sheppard,

36:55.879 --> 36:59.833
authentication code
Bravo Delta Charlie Alpha Niner.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.718
Daedalus, please come in.

37:01.881 --> 37:05.396
Authenticated. Colonel Sheppard,
what the hell happened to your Jumper?

37:05.559 --> 37:08.517
I got turned around in the parking garage.
I was in a rush, so I borrowed this Dart.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.072
I've got the team
beamed into a storage device.

37:11.236 --> 37:12.994
Do you have Teyla?
- Yes, and the baby.

37:13.157 --> 37:15.515
You beamed a baby into Wraith storage?

37:15.679 --> 37:17.596
No.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.060
I got him right here,

37:21.800 --> 37:25.349
so feel free to do
whatever you want to that cruiser.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.756
Copy that.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.832
Major Marks,
please make that ship go away.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.180
Yes, sir.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.718
Colonel Sheppard, why don't you
head down to the planet,

37:44.881 --> 37:46.357
beam your crew out, and land that Dart?

37:46.521 --> 37:48.274
I'm pretty sure you can dial up
that stargate now.

37:48.437 --> 37:50.737
Copy that.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.516
Hey, what's with the bags?

38:03.679 --> 38:05.317
What's with the flowers?
- Going to see Teyla.

38:05.481 --> 38:06.675
You probably heard, I delivered her baby.

38:06.839 --> 38:10.196
I did, and they tell me
she's going to name him Rodney.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.836
Yes! Really?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.714
No, not really.

38:13.878 --> 38:15.677
That's funny. Where you going?

38:15.840 --> 38:17.477
Back to Earth.
- What? Why?

38:17.641 --> 38:19.357
They caught the last Ba'al clone.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.875
The Tok'ra are going
to extract the symbiote.

38:21.038 --> 38:23.113
They want SG-1 to put in an appearance.

38:23.277 --> 38:24.715
Okay.
- Plus,

38:24.878 --> 38:27.395
the IOA want to do an exhaustive review

38:27.559 --> 38:29.952
of my first year in command, so,

38:30.116 --> 38:31.677
you know, that can't be good.
- Are you crazy?

38:31.841 --> 38:34.153
They probably want to give you a medal.
You had a great year.

38:34.316 --> 38:36.154
I know my opinion
doesn't mean much to those folks,

38:36.317 --> 38:39.995
but I think you've done an excellent job.
I'm glad you took the post.

38:40.159 --> 38:42.356
Thanks, Rodney. That means a lot.

38:42.519 --> 38:45.552
Tell Sheppard the court-martial
will have to wait.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.940
Sure. See you soon.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.540
Hope so.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.113
How long will the surgery take?

38:56.277 --> 39:00.313
Doc says a few hours,
but I'll be off my feet for a week or so.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.117
I cannot believe you attempted
to mount a rescue in your condition.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.676
"Attempt"? The last time I checked,
I succeeded.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.155
How's the kid?

39:12.318 --> 39:14.874
Dr. Keller says he's perfectly healthy.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.552
I say he's perfectly everything.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.672
That's great. That's great.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.220
I want to thank you.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.435
There's no need.

39:29.598 --> 39:32.074
I never gave up hope because I knew...

39:33.760 --> 39:36.555
I knew that you would come for me, John.

39:36.718 --> 39:39.114
You would have done the same for me.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.556
Yes.

39:40.719 --> 39:43.148
All right. You ready, Colonel?

39:43.880 --> 39:47.873
Ready? From my understanding,
I'm not doing anything.

39:48.520 --> 39:53.230
No, that's right. You just have to lay still
and let me play with your insides.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.549
Sorry. Let's go.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.274
What are you gonna name the kid?

40:03.437 --> 40:06.796
Well, if it's all right with you,
I was thinking of Torren John,

40:06.960 --> 40:09.673
after my father and after you.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.676
Really? Wow.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.140
McKay's going to hate that.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.154
I would be very honored.

40:18.317 --> 40:20.396
Very well.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.632
Torren John Emmagan.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.715
Colonel Carter.
- Mr. Woolsey, how are you?

40:37.879 --> 40:39.714
Very well. Thank you for asking.

40:39.877 --> 40:42.874
So, is this whole evaluation process
gonna take very long?

40:43.038 --> 40:44.554
I mean, there's a lot of work
to be done on Atlantis,

40:44.718 --> 40:46.075
and I'm kind of anxious to get back.

40:46.238 --> 40:47.717
I'm sure you are.

40:47.881 --> 40:51.156
However, the IOA has decided
that perhaps someone

40:51.320 --> 40:53.958
with a different skill set
would be more suited

40:54.121 --> 40:56.514
to lead the Atlantis expedition now.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.316
Excuse me?

40:59.480 --> 41:02.956
I'm here to inform you that,
effective immediately,

41:03.119 --> 41:05.469
you are being removed from command.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.678
Who's replacing me?

41:10.841 --> 41:13.141
As a matter of fact,

41:13.880 --> 41:16.180
I am.
