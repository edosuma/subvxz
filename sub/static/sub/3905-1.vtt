WEBVTT

00:20.437 --> 00:21.729
Huxley Station.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.022
Ugh, shit.

00:24.649 --> 00:25.649
Sorry.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.445
Next stop, Huxley Station.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.378
Next train to New York City

00:46.463 --> 00:49.256
will be departing
on Platform 8B in 10 minutes.

00:49.716 --> 00:53.719
Next train to New York City,
Platform 8B in 10 minutes.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.305
Hey, hey! It's Sarah.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.974
Yeah, I'm... I'm back in town.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.980
I wanna see Kira, okay?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.862
Well, that's not fair, is it?

01:15.325 --> 01:16.658
Can I at least speak to her?

01:18.787 --> 01:19.787
Hello?

01:21.164 --> 01:22.164
Bitch.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.229
Stop the train! Stop the train!

02:27.647 --> 02:29.148
Stop the train!

02:36.406 --> 02:37.406
Somebody help.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.199
No!

02:42.078 --> 02:43.495
Get some help down here, now!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.750
Elizabeth Childs.

04:17.005 --> 04:18.173
Two phones.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.400
Oh, my God. You look like crap.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.696
- Hi!
- Hello!

04:40.780 --> 04:43.198
No, seriously, ew!

04:43.533 --> 04:44.533
All right.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.243
How's life, Felix?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.870
This long no see, you don't get to know.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.039
I didn't miss your birthday, did I?

04:51.124 --> 04:55.043
No, I know. it's totally
pedestrian, the only reason I'm here.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.005
- Oi, Bobby.
- Hey, Felix.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.715
- Guinness?
- Yeah.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.258
How's Vic the dick?

05:01.342 --> 05:04.177
Yeah, I hit him first this time.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.556
With an ashtray, so...

05:07.932 --> 05:09.308
He's a little blue.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.606
- Coke?
- It's Vic's.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.859
Think you can flip it
to one of your Bay Street blow boys?

05:18.901 --> 05:20.819
You have no idea what that costs me.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.070
I'll give you 20%.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.739
I wasn't talking about my cut, Sarah.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.324
I was talking about my pride.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.533
What are you up to?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.118
I'm here for Kira, Fe.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.244
After what happened,

05:29.620 --> 05:32.122
you really think Mrs. S
is gonna let you take her?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.540
She's my daughter, she's gonna have to.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.376
You've been gone for almost a year, Sarah.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.838
I'm not judging, I'm just saying.

05:39.922 --> 05:40.964
All right.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.257
Ta!

05:42.300 --> 05:45.469
Yeah, so I'm back on the run,
the usual Sarah shite storm.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.553
Apparently.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.765
Well, on that note, something
really weird just happened at the train station.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.016
What?

05:51.934 --> 05:53.560
I saw a girl kill herself.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.603
Ew!

05:54.812 --> 05:56.104
A jumper?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.775
Yeah, and she looked exactly like me, Felix.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.777
What do you mean?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.198
Oh, you robbed her body.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.283
No, she left her bag on the platform.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.285
Ain't that essentially robbing her body?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.461
Okay, that's weird.

06:19.754 --> 06:20.754
Yeah, you think?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.130
Elizabeth Childs.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.715
It's you with a nice haircut.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.801
And a nice address.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.470
What the hell, Fe, did I have a twin sister?

06:28.513 --> 06:31.932
Well, now, when you're a poor little orphan
foster wretch, anything's possible.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.475
Or so we tell ourselves.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.229
I'm gonna go up to her flat.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.981
Yeah, to find out who she is,
to rob the rest of her shit.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.443
Or car. There has to be a car.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.323
Is that her phone?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.659
- Yeah.
- Well, answer it.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.625
Try and get 20k for it, yeah?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.044
All right, fine. What about Vic?

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
I'll call ya.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.925
- Okay.
- Okay?

07:07.009 --> 07:08.009
Okay.

07:43.129 --> 07:53.555
Hello?

08:23.085 --> 08:24.085
Boyfriend.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.923
Squares.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.221
Paul Deardon.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.764
Out of town till Saturday.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.371
Well...

09:01.165 --> 09:03.708
Shitful quality. I'll give you 10 for it.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.461
10? With the hay roll?

09:07.338 --> 09:08.338
You can do better.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.298
--I'll think about it.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.466
Think fast.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.301
--Okay.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.012
--Okay!

09:16.597 --> 09:18.390
Shit.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.021
- What? Oh, shit.
- Where the hell is Sarah?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.190
- Where is she?
- Vic, I can't breathe.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.235
- Oh!
- Sarah! Sarah!

09:30.319 --> 09:32.320
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Move.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.281
Where the hell is Sarah?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.575
- Toodles.
- Where is she?

09:36.659 --> 09:37.659
I don't know.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.995
I haven't seen her in like a year.
She's been with you.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.663
- Bullshit!
- She's not my problem anymore.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.331
Listen to me, Felix,
I'm just gonna ask you once.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.625
Where is the coke?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.002
Cocaine?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.336
Felix?

09:49.797 --> 09:51.506
All right, fine.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.050
Here.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
Blow me.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.680
That's really funny.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.015
What the hell happened to your head?

10:00.057 --> 10:03.184
Well, let's see, Sarah blindsided me, then
she took off with the coke.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.729
Listen to me! Listen to me.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.690
Listen, I'm on the hook with Pouchy.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.859
Look at me, you understand? Look at me.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.361
That's gonna bring pain on me.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.947
Till I find her, it's on you.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.787
You mind if I have this?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.458
I'll be back, she better be here, fruitcake.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.710
Lovely to see you again, Victor.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.379
Sarah.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.631
It's Beth.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.383
So, my credit is max, but...

10:36.886 --> 10:38.219
I've got a sweet pad

10:38.262 --> 10:41.222
and my new boyfriend, Paul's,
out of town till the weekend.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.225
Unfortunately, your real
boyfriend, Vic the dick,

10:44.268 --> 10:45.810
- is already here.
- Shit!

10:46.228 --> 10:48.188
Oh, I'm fine, by the way, thank you.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.564
I'm sorry, Fe.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.316
And your blow is abysmal, by the way.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.276
- I'll be lucky to get 10k for it.
- What?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.402
That's not enough.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.446
- For what?
- To get out, Fe.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.448
Set ourselves up with Kira somewhere.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.617
Sarah, who is Elizabeth Childs?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.285
I don't know.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.953
Just a girl who looks like me.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.081
Girl with a pretty nice life.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.123
If it was so nice,

11:07.208 --> 11:08.416
why did she kill herself?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.047
Hold on. Fe?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.758
She's got $75,000 in her savings account.

11:16.884 --> 11:17.884
Say again?

11:18.260 --> 11:19.678
75k.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.640
The account was just opened
like three weeks ago.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.893
That's enough to lose bloody Vic, yeah?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.436
We can get away with this, Fe.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.646
The three of us.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.357
Sarah, any second,
someone's gonna ID the body,

11:32.441 --> 11:35.235
and it's game over.
So you should really just drop it all right now.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.278
Nice work, with the ashtray, by the way.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.822
Vic has stitches.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.240
- Hello?
- I'm standing outside

11:40.282 --> 11:42.242
- Huxley Station, right now,
- Shh, shut up, I'm thinking.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.326
which we can see is emptying out.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.953
Authorities have cleared out the station

11:44.995 --> 11:48.790
after an unidentified woman
fell onto the tracks and was killed.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.793
Our witnesses aren't sure
how the woman came to be on the tracks,

11:51.877 --> 11:53.586
or whether foul play was involved.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.631
Fe, I have an idea.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.508
All right, give me a big smile.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.176
- I want a big smile.
- Why are you shooting me?

12:00.261 --> 12:01.344
'Cause I love shooting.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.429
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.577
Oh, shit.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.995
Drugstore counter.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.749
What's up, hot stuff?

12:38.507 --> 12:41.760
Are you ready to push your body...

12:42.970 --> 12:55.064
You're damn right.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.525
You're damn...
You're damn...

12:57.610 --> 12:58.902
You're damn right.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.701
Sorry, Art. Whoever you are.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.661
I'm gone for good.

13:08.913 --> 13:15.168
You're damn right.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.352
Hi, uh, Beth Childs.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.103
I have an appointment with the manager.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.230
Stephen Riggs.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.689
Sure, I'll let him know you're here.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.277
Ugh!

13:41.570 --> 13:42.946
- Felix!
- Ow!

13:43.364 --> 13:45.073
Use it or hang it up, okay?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.075
Do not snap towels at me, Bobby.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.410
I had a very traumatic childhood.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.341
Yeah, hi, um...

14:03.634 --> 14:05.301
Oh, totally awful.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.638
Apparently, a girl killed
herself at Huxley Station last night,

14:08.722 --> 14:10.223
and I think I know her.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.268
Sarah. Sarah Manning.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.106
- Beth? Good to see you again.
- Yeah, hi.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.357
--How are you?

14:19.441 --> 14:22.193
Yeah, good, Stephen. Thanks.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.862
Um, busy?

14:24.446 --> 14:28.324
Appeared last week at 2:14.
It was only a half but it almost killed me.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.827
- Hmm.
- How'd you do your last charity run?

14:30.911 --> 14:34.038
I... Don't know, in fact.

14:34.415 --> 14:38.251
I need to make
a large withdrawal from that account.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.087
I see, that is the one you just opened.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.591
Yeah, I'll leave 500 in
to keep the account open.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.342
But I need, um, the rest.

14:46.635 --> 14:49.178
- In cash, please?
- Cash?

14:49.638 --> 14:52.181
- Yeah.
- I really recommend a cashier's check, if you...

14:52.474 --> 14:54.100
Uh, no. 50s and 10os, please.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.644
Well, we don't keep that much on hand.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.355
See, anything over $10,000,
we have to special order

14:59.440 --> 15:01.733
and that takes two to four business days.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.776
- So...

15:07.990 --> 15:08.990
Stephen...

15:09.700 --> 15:11.075
What can I do to, uh...

15:11.160 --> 15:12.660
To put a rush on that.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.829
You know, 24 hours.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.921
Could I, um, sponsor your next
charity run thing?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.967
- You certainly can. Deal.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.514
But... This card is...

15:33.557 --> 15:36.100
Oh, I'm not even sure I've activated that, yet.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.269
If I did, I need to re-pin it.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.687
Demagnetize, maybe?

15:39.939 --> 15:40.939
Yeah, you know what?

15:41.482 --> 15:44.442
Let's start with a new one.
And then we'll organize the withdrawal.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.568
Okay.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.699
Do you want access to your
safe deposit box as well?

15:54.119 --> 15:57.747
- Oh, yeah. I'd... I'd love that, Stephen.
- Sure.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.796
"Where are you?"
"Must see you."

16:08.133 --> 16:09.384
And good luck with that.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.894
Alison Hendrix.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.521
Elizabeth Childs.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.692
Katja Obinger.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.425
What the hell are you doing?

16:51.385 --> 16:52.427
Shit.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.637
Get in the car.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.849
Yeah, yeah, no thanks.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.559
Go, get in the car, damn it.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.185
God. What... What's the charge?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.979
Don't, Beth, not today.

17:06.942 --> 17:07.942
We're late.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.944
Yeah. Okay, yeah, calm down.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.165
Where were you?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.291
We're gonna walk through it again.

17:25.961 --> 17:29.047
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got held up.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.009
- Don't worry about it.
- I worry.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.136
Suddenly, you don't give a damn, I get pissed.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.139
My fat ass is on the line here, too.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.933
Now you had better be ready.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.769
Are you ready?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.813
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.691
You're sure as hell overdressed.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.651
What? Were you out all night or something?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.571
No, you know what, give me a...

17:54.239 --> 17:55.823
A second, I'll go in and change.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.866
Right.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.826
You'll probably take off on me again.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.747
Look, Beth, I know this shit
is as hard as it gets.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.875
But you gotta stop making it worse.

18:13.175 --> 18:17.095
Art, just drive.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.640
Oh, is that her?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.225
Yes.

18:22.893 --> 18:23.893
Are you okay?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.686
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.652
Oh, Colin, um...

18:33.403 --> 18:34.403
Can I call you Colin?

18:34.696 --> 18:35.696
My mom does.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.156
Oh, um...

18:37.866 --> 18:40.451
Well, don't get me wrong,
I usually do enjoy creepy,

18:40.536 --> 18:42.328
I do, it's just, um...

18:43.038 --> 18:46.165
The air in here
or is that just me because it smells like...

18:46.208 --> 18:47.333
Uh, no...

18:48.418 --> 18:49.418
it's death.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.507
You can do this, though. it can be a...

18:54.716 --> 18:56.592
- A gestalt.
- Oh, my.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.404
Holy shite.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.488
Let's go.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.931
Hey, good luck, Beth.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.686
Fashionably late, you called it.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.104
She's here, Lieutenant.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.314
Then get busy.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.398
Detective, come with me.

19:52.482 --> 19:53.482
Show's over.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.443
Oh!

19:56.570 --> 20:00.489
Stick to your statement and you will be fine.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.782
Okay?

20:07.581 --> 20:10.917
I gotta, um, I gotta use
a washroom, Lieutenant.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.795
All right, get yourself sorted.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.049
Detective.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.217
Yeah?

20:19.426 --> 20:20.801
Washroom's this way.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.054
Right.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.578
Felix, Beth is a cop.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.704
I'm a cop.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.122
Felix, abort.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.459
This will be shocking, Felix.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.419
But for her it was instant.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.837
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.175
Oh, my God... I... Oh, that's...

21:01.677 --> 21:03.302
That's so...

21:13.897 --> 21:15.773
Oh, I can't... I can't do it.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.526
I need to... That's...
This is too messed up, I can't.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.695
- That's okay, you can lean on me, it's fine.
- All right.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.057
Thank you.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.228
Water.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.022
Delicious.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.148
Is it her?

21:57.441 --> 21:58.482
Yeah.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.609
Your sister, I'm very sorry.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.654
Foster sister, but we were very close.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.074
You know, we spent all of our,
um, formative years together.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.576
Right.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.997
Okay, well, uh, there's a few
things you need to sign.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.291
Um... But...

22:15.542 --> 22:19.587
if you, um... if you need...
Want anyone to talk to...

22:19.796 --> 22:23.507
Um... You know, over a drink or...

22:26.053 --> 22:28.054
Well, aren't you an odd duck?

22:46.323 --> 22:49.367
All right, statement of Officer
Elizabeth Childs, entering into record

22:49.451 --> 22:51.202
her version of the line-of-duty shooting

22:51.286 --> 22:53.954
on the 7th October of this year,

22:54.039 --> 22:57.124
resulting in a civilian fatality,
one Margaret Chan.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.753
In your own words, please,
begin by stating your name.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.805
Anytime, Detective.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.524
I panicked. What do you want me to say?

23:22.317 --> 23:24.318
Pretty much anything, but "I panicked".

23:27.531 --> 23:28.572
I'm kidding.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.201
Where's your wit gone?

23:33.161 --> 23:34.995
You haven't called me dipshit all day.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.541
You don't have to babysit me, dipshit.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.667
I know.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.085
But who else would?

23:42.337 --> 23:44.004
Thanks, Doc. See you next week.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.842
Look, Beth, I know this thing
has got you all twisted up,

23:49.678 --> 23:51.053
but you gotta forgive yourself.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.347
Shootings happen,

23:53.598 --> 23:55.224
to whoever's there, with a gun in their hand.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.103
Hmm.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.856
Dr. Bower will see you now.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.329
- Felix, open the goddamn door.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.167
Felix, I know
you're in there, open the door now.

24:24.963 --> 24:25.963
Oh.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.174
You bastard.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.553
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.472
Huh?

24:37.142 --> 24:38.142
Where's Sarah?

24:39.936 --> 24:40.936
Sarah is dead.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.105
I'm sorry, what?

24:43.982 --> 24:44.982
She's dead.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.400
- Vic...

24:46.776 --> 24:47.902
She killed herself.

24:48.111 --> 24:49.445
Yeah? Bullshit.

24:49.863 --> 24:50.863
Where is she, Felix?

24:51.072 --> 24:53.407
She jumped in front of a train

24:53.450 --> 24:56.035
because you are such an arsehole!

24:59.122 --> 25:00.164
What's this?

25:01.082 --> 25:02.082
Her death certificate.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.167
Bullshit.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.502
It's not real.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.962
I identified her body.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.716
- Vic, she's dead! She's gone.
- Okay, Felix, stop it. Stop! Stop it.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.719
She told you to say this?
She's not dead. Where is she?

25:20.977 --> 25:22.561
Stupid bitch.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.108
Sarah?

25:40.038 --> 25:42.248
- It's not coming back to you?
- Hmm...

25:42.457 --> 25:44.500
No, I'm... I'm... Not really.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.920
Uh, I... I know I shot a civilian.

25:48.964 --> 25:52.216
Maggie Chan? 44, single, churchgoer.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.635
I'm just missing, uh...

25:55.053 --> 25:56.220
Missing what? Explain.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.472
Uh... Myself.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.307
Um...

26:02.644 --> 26:05.813
Yeah, um, I glitched.

26:06.606 --> 26:07.940
Break or something.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.986
I think I need some leave.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.697
You're under suspension.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.657
Right.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.201
See, I'm having trouble with detail.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.580
So, I'm not sure I should say anything at all.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.832
It's okay. it's all confidential.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.127
Have you shared
any of these dissociations with Paul?

26:28.503 --> 26:31.422
Yeah, no... We're fine.
I don't wanna talk about Paul.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.549
Paul's away. No, he's in Cleveland.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.136
Beth...

26:37.804 --> 26:40.764
Uh, waitress makes a mistake at work,

26:40.974 --> 26:44.602
she, what, drops
a plate of meat loaf, doesn't get a tip.

26:44.686 --> 26:47.688
- Hmm...
- Try to separate mistake from result.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.815
Getting back on the job for you is all about

26:49.858 --> 26:53.235
moving forward from a moment
you can never take back.

26:53.903 --> 26:56.822
You need to talk to me about that moment.

26:59.534 --> 27:02.536
About seeing cell phone and reacting gun.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.538
Mmm-hmm.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.457
Can I make another appointment?

27:16.092 --> 27:20.262
So, your twin, all hopped up
on cop tranquilizers,

27:20.347 --> 27:23.557
guns down an innocent Chinese lady
holding a cell phone in her hand.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.809
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.646
I'm not even sure her partner knows.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.439
Feels like she's lying about something.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.525
For 75 grand in a new account.

27:33.902 --> 27:34.943
She well dodgy.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.613
Yeah, whatever she was into
drove her plenty nuts, yeah.

27:38.281 --> 27:41.033
Yeah. Suicide's thrilling, agreed.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.577
But... Can we get the elephant
out of the room?

27:44.704 --> 27:45.746
What?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.081
Well, look at her.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.125
You're related.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.753
This could be your story.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.421
It's not.

27:54.464 --> 27:58.050
- Every foster kid dreams of their lost family.
- Oh, my God!

27:58.343 --> 28:01.261
Deep down we all hope we're special.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.597
Yeah, the last thing I am is special.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.937
If that was my boyfriend,
I'd jump in front of a train too.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.606
Don't say that. Paul's hot and you know it.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.775
Oh, Vic...

28:15.026 --> 28:17.236
ls keening like a banshee. He wants a funeral.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.946
He can't have a funeral!

28:19.280 --> 28:21.949
The whole sad point is
nobody would notice if I died.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.118
What's this? Birth certificates?

28:24.953 --> 28:27.287
Alison Hendrix, Beth,

28:27.997 --> 28:31.250
Katja Obinger, born in Berlin?

28:35.130 --> 28:37.131
So their birthdays
are all within a month of yours?

28:37.173 --> 28:38.549
It's a coincidence.

28:39.634 --> 28:42.636
I don't care. it's just a score, Fe.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.888
Let me finish what I started and then,

28:45.390 --> 28:47.307
I'll come back for you and Kira, yeah?

28:47.559 --> 28:48.642
Oh!

28:50.311 --> 28:51.979
You're gonna disappear again?

28:52.772 --> 28:54.440
Yeah, I have to, Fe.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.775
It's dangerous shit in this life.

28:57.318 --> 29:00.738
- Somebody keeps texting her.
- Oh, texting! My God, how terrifying!

29:00.822 --> 29:03.115
Look, Fe, sell the coke,

29:03.783 --> 29:06.160
and keep half the money
and give the other half to Kira, yeah?

29:06.202 --> 29:11.749
You left Kira with Mrs. S overnight and you
didn't come back for 10 months.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.006
I'm trying to fix this.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.049
Tell it to the angels, Sarah.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.593
You're already dead.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.585
Shit.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.216
Beth?

30:03.551 --> 30:04.676
Beth?

30:07.722 --> 30:08.722
Hi.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.225
Hey.

30:11.559 --> 30:12.768
"The Clash"?

30:14.145 --> 30:15.813
Oh, yeah, uh...

30:17.106 --> 30:18.398
London calling.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.275
The Clash rock.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.069
Yeah, but you don't.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.991
- Are you going somewhere?
- Uh...

30:28.493 --> 30:30.744
Uh, no. Just gym stuff.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.831
Weren't you coming back on the weekend?

30:34.582 --> 30:35.916
Well, I wanted to be here.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.168
So...

30:41.172 --> 30:42.631
- Yeah?
- How was the hearing?

30:43.424 --> 30:45.050
Oh, uh...

30:45.134 --> 30:47.719
I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.263
You skipped it?

30:49.305 --> 30:52.182
Um, no... Um...

30:53.184 --> 30:56.645
I got sick
to my stomach, I basically puked on them.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.106
Are you serious?

30:59.524 --> 31:01.316
Yeah. Yeah.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.527
Don't worry, I'm okay.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.405
Beth, what's happened?

31:08.950 --> 31:10.158
A lot.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.161
Yeah, I know, but you're...

31:15.456 --> 31:16.790
I'm what?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.462
What did you do to your hair?

31:22.505 --> 31:25.048
Uh... Nothing.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.717
I got it cut.

31:27.635 --> 31:28.886
It's longer.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.388
It's just wet.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.225
Something's different.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.236
- Bedroom.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.787
Right here.

32:45.254 --> 32:48.048
- Felix?
- For crying out loud.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.341
Felix?

32:51.469 --> 32:53.261
I'm sorry, man. I don't know where else to go.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.680
A men's shelter?

32:58.142 --> 32:59.893
What the hell happened to your face?

33:00.395 --> 33:01.478
Got in a fight.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.021
Why, Vic?

33:03.189 --> 33:04.564
Why are you such a dick?

33:04.899 --> 33:06.566
I don't know, I'm angry.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.823
- Can I come in?
- No!

33:13.366 --> 33:14.449
Thanks.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.081
I can't sleep.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.417
I keep seeing her face.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.751
Yeah, me too.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.253
Her pretty face.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.340
Felix, you and me, we have to do something.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.093
There's just no goddamn closure, bro.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.387
We have to have like a...

33:35.972 --> 33:37.931
A memorial send-off or something.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.269
Okay, Vic.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.396
We'll have a wake.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.523
Really? See, that's what
I'm talking about, man.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.859
- A coming together.
- Yeah.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.445
- Cremation's today. I'm buying.
- Oh, shit.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.363
Yeah, it can't be today.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.950
I've got to call Glenn,
that bitch Sherry, her Montreal connections...

33:56.993 --> 33:58.452
- No, no, no, no, no.
- ...are gonna wanna be there.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.620
Locals only, Vic. Fast and light, all right?

34:00.663 --> 34:02.664
It's gonna be an intimate memorial piss-up.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.291
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.626
- Just...
- Can I... Okay.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.713
- That's... All right, um...
- Thank you.

34:10.297 --> 34:14.509
You know what, first though,
you need a shower and a Xanax.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.594
Okay.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.154
- Mmm...
- Oh!

34:35.072 --> 34:36.322
For real?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.367
That was amazing.

34:40.661 --> 34:41.661
Was it?

34:41.704 --> 34:45.331
Where you been hiding that accent
for like two years?

34:46.542 --> 34:48.877
Uh, I got up for the gym, Paul.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.254
Okay.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.467
Well, you want to tell me
what happened at the hearing?

34:57.762 --> 35:01.848
Uh, I choked, I guess, um...

35:02.517 --> 35:04.726
They reconvene
in a couple of days, so don't worry about it.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.187
Beth.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.939
Hmm. What?

35:10.233 --> 35:11.775
Are you back on the meds?

35:14.570 --> 35:15.779
No.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.405
Then you didn't choke.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.033
You're just finally feeling something.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.119
Feeling like the real you.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.538
I got up for the gym.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.208
Are you driving today?

35:28.376 --> 35:29.376
What?

35:30.711 --> 35:32.379
Uh, can I borrow the keys to your car?

35:32.672 --> 35:35.090
- Use your own car.
- Can't find my keys.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.926
Did you check the thing
where they always are?

35:38.469 --> 35:41.221
Yep. Yeah, I checked the thing
where they always are.

35:50.731 --> 35:51.940
Mmm.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.456
Nice.

36:39.655 --> 36:42.282
Felix, we can't part angry this time.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.409
It's not good for your skin, okay.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.662
Call me or I'll squeeze
your bloody bollocks in a vise...

36:48.080 --> 36:49.289
Everything all right?

36:49.457 --> 36:52.125
Oh, yeah. Obnoxious English relative.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.963
Well, I've got your cash.

36:57.965 --> 37:01.468
I just need your signature here.

37:17.985 --> 37:18.985
Thank you.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.660
All right, then. All done.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.381
Here.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.967
Okay. Good luck with that run.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.058
Fe!

38:52.955 --> 38:54.205
Felix.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.793
You little shit.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.802
"Sarah had a big heart.

39:08.971 --> 39:12.098
"It was always fight or flight with her."

39:13.225 --> 39:15.435
You guys remember how she was, right?

39:15.770 --> 39:17.437
It's all based on facts.

39:18.439 --> 39:22.567
"She was the kind of person
you want to hang on to

39:22.610 --> 39:25.612
"but she would not be held with you.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.158
"Sarah, I'm sorry.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.786
"I know, I've a lot to answer for.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.165
"My favorite moment..."

39:37.666 --> 39:40.251
So, is it heaven or hell?

39:40.628 --> 39:42.921
I didn't want a funeral for this very reason, Fe.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.173
Well, you can't do
much about that when you're dead, can you?

39:45.966 --> 39:47.967
I'm watching, right now.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.219
Really?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.179
Oh! Oh!

39:51.806 --> 39:54.307
- Pathetic.
- Let me ask you...

39:54.975 --> 39:56.643
I dressed Vic. How do we look?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.270
Yeah, not as good as Rockabilly Bob.

39:59.313 --> 40:02.023
Who knows,
still Rockabilly after all these years.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.025
Got to respect that.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.696
Sherry is upset though, isn't she?

40:08.781 --> 40:11.366
Oh, yes. She thinks Vic
pushed you in front of the train.

40:11.450 --> 40:12.784
It's priceless, really.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.828
Eh, I've got the money, Fe.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.872
I still want us
to be together, it can work, yeah?

40:18.249 --> 40:20.542
This is our chance
for me, you and Kira to start over.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.669
- Sarah...
- Felix, do you mind?

40:23.170 --> 40:25.672
I'm trying to...
Do you want us to go and come back?

40:25.756 --> 40:28.425
Shit, I'm sorry... Vic's getting mad, I gotta go.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.051
Could you...
Could you hang up your phone?

40:30.177 --> 40:31.803
- Oh, shit.
- What?

40:31.846 --> 40:33.179
Mrs. S is here, Fe.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.264
Shit!

40:37.184 --> 40:38.768
Stop! Stop! Stop!

40:38.853 --> 40:40.854
Oh, shit. No, no, no, Fe.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.234
Oh, shit.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.239
Oh, no, Fe. Kira's there.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.118
She can't think I'm dead, Fe.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.329
Fe!

40:59.623 --> 41:02.250
Oh, God. She can't think I'm dead.

41:23.105 --> 41:26.608
Beth... Beth, why don't you respond to me?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.988
- Beth.
- Just keep away from me.

41:33.073 --> 41:34.782
Beth, it's Katja.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.328
- Oh, my God...
- Why no meeting, Beth? What's happening?

41:38.996 --> 41:41.289
- I...
- I brought the briefcase.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.125
Yeah, the samples for your friend, Beth.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.752
I was careful, like you said.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.670
Yeah, I just... Just stay back.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.672
I'm Katja. Katja Obinger, Beth.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.341
Yeah, I get it. The German.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.051
Okay, I've seen your birth certificate.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.261
Yeah, you asked for it. For proof.

42:01.435 --> 42:04.938
Please, I need to see your
scientist friend, Beth.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.649
Ah, I can't help you.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.488
- Get out of the car!
- Why are you doing this?

42:14.949 --> 42:17.367
Your partner, he was following you.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.622
You were the one in the black car?

42:23.165 --> 42:24.832
The one that flashed your lights.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.417
Yeah.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.920
You need to go.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.964
You're police, Beth?

42:31.215 --> 42:33.174
- We need to...
- Don't. Get out!

42:36.845 --> 42:37.971
Just one.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.473
I'm a few, no family, too. Who am I?

42:44.645 --> 42:46.312
You're not Beth.

43:18.887 --> 43:20.638
Oh, God! Shit.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.349
Shit!

43:45.998 --> 43:55.757
Shit.

43:59.094 --> 44:00.094
Hello.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.812
This is not Sarah, it's not Sarah.

44:11.148 --> 44:12.315
We've been here before.

44:12.399 --> 44:14.567
No, Paul.
We definitely haven't been here before.

44:15.569 --> 44:16.861
- Shit.
- Hey, hey!

44:16.904 --> 44:18.279
Whoa, whoa! Take it easy.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.657
Are you wearing a wire?

44:20.866 --> 44:22.116
When is Mummy coming?

44:23.410 --> 44:25.411
- Sarah! Sarah!
