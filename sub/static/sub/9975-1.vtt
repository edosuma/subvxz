Why? What's up?

04:43.653 --> 04:44.853
Nothing.

04:44.854 --> 04:46.822
Just stopped by
to check out your decks.

04:46.823 --> 04:47.856
I kind of
thrashed mine.

Totally different.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.377
want to buy
something?

05:08.378 --> 05:09.711
I wish I could, dude. I'm broke.

05:09.712 --> 05:11.880
I'm broke.
Just let me hang out, though.

05:11.881 --> 05:12.947
I'm your best customer.

05:12.948 --> 05:14.182
I'm here every day.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.283
Yeah, but you never
spend any money.

05:15.284 --> 05:16.351
You've got to start
spending money.

05:16.352 --> 05:18.553
Money-spending is good.

Yo, little man!

05:19.756 --> 05:21.089
I talked to you
already.

You reach your hand in there
with that T-shirt,

05:22.725 --> 05:23.992
you're pulling out a stump.

05:23.993 --> 05:24.993
Don't make me
come over there

05:24.994 --> 05:26.595
and smack you.

05:26.596 --> 05:27.696
Yo, Bam.

05:34.937 --> 05:36.070
Let me get
a skateboard.

05:36.071 --> 05:37.138
Which one
do you want?

05:37.139 --> 05:38.206
I don't care.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.708
They're all
the same shape.

05:39.709 --> 05:40.909

right there.

three of those.

05:54.189 --> 05:55.323
What's up, man?

05:55.324 --> 05:56.357
How's it going?
Do you remember me?

05:56.358 --> 05:57.592
Probably not.

05:57.593 --> 05:59.594
We skated SCRAP together
a couple of years ago.

05:59.595 --> 06:00.962
Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:00.963 --> 06:02.030
Dude, yeah.
You were ripping.

06:02.031 --> 06:03.231
Thanks, bro.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.800
Keep an eye
on this kid.

06:04.801 --> 06:06.000
Thanks. Appreciate it.

06:06.001 --> 06:08.570
Watch out for this guy's
frontside 360.

06:08.571 --> 06:11.105
He's got the
SSBSTS lurking.

06:11.106 --> 06:12.541
It's for the wall.

06:12.542 --> 06:13.942
You going to the demo
later on?

06:13.943 --> 06:15.209
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.
I wouldn't miss it.

06:15.210 --> 06:16.344
Cool.

06:16.345 --> 06:17.546
It's for the wall.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.213
You don't have
to make excuses.

06:25.555 --> 06:26.922
Sorry.

06:26.923 --> 06:29.891
Bam was a loser
before he got sponsored...

06:29.892 --> 06:30.959
just like you, dude.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.060
Thanks.

06:32.061 --> 06:33.227
I'll tell you what.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.629
I'm going to make you a deal,
Greg.

06:34.630 --> 06:36.832
You flow me one of these decks--

06:36.833 --> 06:37.966
For free?

06:37.967 --> 06:39.601
Yeah, for free.
Exactly,

06:39.602 --> 06:41.837
and in exchange, I'll skate it.

06:41.838 --> 06:43.404
I'll tell everybody
where I got it.

06:43.405 --> 06:44.773
You can sponsor me.

06:44.774 --> 06:46.374
All right, dude.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.777
Which one do you want?

06:48.778 --> 06:50.645
For real?

06:50.646 --> 06:52.781
All right.

06:52.782 --> 06:54.983
Um, how about we go
with one of those Elements,

06:54.984 --> 06:56.918

06:56.919 --> 06:59.187
Dude,

06:59.188 --> 07:00.555

07:48.203 --> 07:50.304
Shut up.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.008
I still can't
believe it, man.

07:54.009 --> 07:55.309
Bam just walks in

07:55.310 --> 07:58.045
and Greg tosses him
a handful of his decks.

07:58.046 --> 08:01.816
I can't wait to get
my own deck.

08:01.817 --> 08:03.251
Well, I did the math.

08:03.252 --> 08:05.119
and there really is
like 53 guys

08:05.120 --> 08:06.788
who make a living
skating

08:06.789 --> 08:08.189
and about a million
wannabes like us.

08:08.190 --> 08:09.323
And?

08:09.324 --> 08:11.526
And nothing,
but until a sponsor

08:11.527 --> 08:12.727
literally backs
a tour bus up

08:12.728 --> 08:13.728
into my driveway,

08:13.729 --> 08:14.763
I have to work
all summer

08:14.764 --> 08:15.797
to pay for school.

08:15.798 --> 08:16.865
That's just
the way it is.

08:16.866 --> 08:17.965
I don't believe you.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.567
You're still going
to bail on me.

08:19.568 --> 08:20.835
You know what?

08:20.836 --> 08:21.969
I remember Matt

08:21.970 --> 08:23.037
listening
to your crap,

08:23.038 --> 08:24.038
and look where
that got him.

08:24.039 --> 08:25.407
The guy is a complete stain.

08:25.408 --> 08:27.008
See, Matt deceives you.

08:27.009 --> 08:28.075
I don't--

08:28.076 --> 08:29.210
He does, because he...

08:29.211 --> 08:30.311
In actuality,

08:30.312 --> 08:32.346
he really knows
which end is up.

08:32.347 --> 08:34.315
Wahoo!

08:46.562 --> 08:49.063
What's up, man?

08:50.699 --> 08:52.199
So Dustin's bailing on us again.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.535
Oh, really?

08:53.536 --> 08:54.936
I'm going to alert the press,
man.

08:54.937 --> 08:56.170
Dustin's always bailing.

08:58.307 --> 08:59.507
I'm always
going to skate.

08:59.508 --> 09:01.075
I'm just not going to
be homeless with you.

09:01.076 --> 09:02.276
You say that
all the time,

09:02.277 --> 09:03.445
but I know you mean
something else.

09:03.446 --> 09:04.612
Before you know it,

09:04.613 --> 09:06.748
you're going to be

about 20 times,

wishing you were
skating again.

Dudes...

09:13.823 --> 09:16.624

09:17.726 --> 09:18.960

09:18.961 --> 09:20.428
Hey, when is the moron

09:20.429 --> 09:22.764
going to release his death grip
on our premises?

09:22.765 --> 09:24.231
Have you smelled it in there
lately?

09:24.232 --> 09:25.633
It's like an open sewer.

09:25.634 --> 09:26.968
It's good to see you
too, Pops.

09:26.969 --> 09:28.636
Hey, we need to talk
about the future, huh?

09:28.637 --> 09:29.671
Yeah, you know,
I'd love to,

09:29.672 --> 09:30.738
but we're actually
heading out to this--

09:30.739 --> 09:31.940
Hey...

09:31.941 --> 09:34.141
Sugarplum.

09:34.142 --> 09:35.376
I hate when he
calls me that.

09:37.045 --> 09:39.013
Listen, remember our deal.

09:39.014 --> 09:40.982
Dad, I--

09:40.983 --> 09:43.084
Don't "Dad" me.
We had a deal.

09:43.085 --> 09:44.251
You're either
in school,

09:44.252 --> 09:45.487
or you're down
at Rivers Hardware

09:45.488 --> 09:46.588
working next
to your old man,

09:46.589 --> 09:48.089
sniffing a little
of that lacquer

09:48.090 --> 09:49.323
while you're mixing the paint,
huh?

09:49.324 --> 09:51.759
Come on!

09:51.760 --> 09:53.027
Obvious perks there. Come on.

09:53.028 --> 09:54.529
It's a good living.
It's a good future.

09:54.530 --> 09:55.864
It's a good life,

09:55.865 --> 09:57.298
I'll tell you
that much, huh?

09:57.299 --> 09:58.533
Think about it.

09:58.534 --> 10:00.334
Yeah. Let's go, honey.

10:00.335 --> 10:01.536
Come on.

10:01.537 --> 10:02.604

you little...

Dude, your stepmom
is so hot.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.276
See the way
she was looking at me?

10:09.277 --> 10:11.212
I was like...

Hey, there.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.303
Hi, yeah, I ordered

10:36.304 --> 10:38.305
a Tummy-Killer
Ranchero,

10:38.306 --> 10:40.475
and I got a Double-Chunk
Gut Bomb with cheese

10:40.476 --> 10:41.576

10:41.577 --> 10:42.643
Listen, I'd like what I ordered.

10:42.644 --> 10:43.711
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't--

10:43.712 --> 10:44.712
Hello?

10:44.713 --> 10:46.748
I didn't get that, sir.
Could you...

10:46.749 --> 10:48.249
Could you
repeat that?

10:48.250 --> 10:49.316
Open your ears,

10:49.317 --> 10:50.585
jackass!

10:50.586 --> 10:51.619
Yeah, I see

10:51.620 --> 10:53.220
that you already ate
the Gut Bomb, though.

10:53.221 --> 10:54.655
Yeah, but I
can't help it

10:54.656 --> 10:55.890
that I didn't
figure it out

10:55.891 --> 10:56.891
until I'd
swallowed it all.

10:58.159 --> 10:59.861
Okay, you really think
you need another?

10:59.862 --> 11:00.995
What?

11:00.996 --> 11:02.663
Mr. Knight,
let me handle this.

11:02.664 --> 11:03.698
Sir, our policy
clearly states...

11:03.699 --> 11:04.699
Hey!

11:04.700 --> 11:06.100
Every customer

11:06.101 --> 11:08.503
will be served to
his satisfaction.

11:08.504 --> 11:09.604
Customer may receive
a replacement...

11:09.605 --> 11:10.605
Excuse me,

11:10.606 --> 11:11.873
I'll be right
with you.

11:11.874 --> 11:13.307
A replacement will be given
as long as he has a receipt.

11:13.308 --> 11:14.542
You have your receipt?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.277
All right, that's good.
Give him one of these.

11:16.278 --> 11:17.344
You're late, Eric.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.480
You're just
a little bit late...

11:19.481 --> 11:20.515
Uh-huh.

11:20.516 --> 11:22.450
and late
is not great, sir.

11:22.451 --> 11:24.184
Do you want to go
to the restroom

11:24.185 --> 11:25.686
and then come back
before I reload you?

11:25.687 --> 11:27.955
You want me to call
the grown-up back up here?

11:27.956 --> 11:28.989
I'm just saying,
you're probably leaking beans.

11:28.990 --> 11:30.024
I don't know.

11:30.025 --> 11:31.091
One big scoop.

11:31.092 --> 11:32.259
That's two, but...

11:32.260 --> 11:33.828
Two is enough.
Two is plenty.

11:33.829 --> 11:34.929
Now, let's go right over here

11:34.930 --> 11:36.230
and do the cheddar.

11:36.231 --> 11:37.465
Two scoops of cheddar,
one scoop of onion.

11:37.466 --> 11:39.033
Two scoops cheddar,
one scoop onion.

11:39.034 --> 11:40.334
That's very good, son.

11:40.335 --> 11:42.336
You know, Eric, you've
got great potential.

11:42.337 --> 11:43.871
You just go to it.
You go to it, deputy.

11:43.872 --> 11:46.441
Okay? Attaboy!
Fire in the Hole!

11:46.442 --> 11:48.108
One Fire in the Hole.

No, sir, no, sir,
we don't have diet.

11:53.982 --> 11:55.950
Two hours

11:55.951 --> 11:57.452
Let's get this place
cleaned up

11:57.453 --> 11:58.486
and get the hell
out of here.

11:58.487 --> 11:59.587
I can't. I need the overtime.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.156
Oh, boy. Boy, howdy.

12:02.157 --> 12:04.826
Someone really
abused the men's room in there.

12:04.827 --> 12:06.727
It's like a doody bomb exploded.

12:06.728 --> 12:08.729
Was he a tall guy
with glasses maybe?

12:08.730 --> 12:09.964
Just a hunch.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.566
Think this is funny,
Mr. Knight?

12:11.567 --> 12:12.834
No, I don't.

12:12.835 --> 12:14.335
Show a little
team spirit.

12:14.336 --> 12:15.369
Why don't you
go in there

12:15.370 --> 12:16.370
and make it sparkle?

12:16.371 --> 12:17.371
Here you go.

12:17.372 --> 12:18.405
It'll be my pleasure.

12:18.406 --> 12:19.540
Thank you, sir.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.175
Hey, listen...
wear gloves, buddy.

12:21.176 --> 12:22.343
Keep laughing, Eric,

12:22.344 --> 12:23.644
but I'm going to be at college
in the fall,

12:23.645 --> 12:25.145
and you'll still be here,
so think about that.

12:25.146 --> 12:27.648
And you, sir.

12:27.649 --> 12:28.749
There's a
birthday party

12:28.750 --> 12:31.652
at table 13.

12:31.653 --> 12:32.987
Need you in
the bean suit.

12:35.491 --> 12:37.191
You're kidding me.
The bean suit again?

12:37.192 --> 12:39.927
Bean suit, right away.

12:39.928 --> 12:42.697
Thank you, sir.

12:43.932 --> 12:44.999
Whose birthday is it?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.033
Ours.
Ours.

today...

13:58.374 --> 13:59.874

13:59.875 --> 14:02.277

and pay attention.

I'm not skating today,

of his shirt,

a new one...

been in a wet spell.

Is that where he is?

19:02.544 --> 19:04.412
That's a big "no" on Jimmy.

looking at, pinhead?

here to see Jimmy.

19:16.224 --> 19:20.528

this tape by for him.

19:20.529 --> 19:22.729

to sponsor us, but...

19:22.730 --> 19:23.931

to watch all those?

19:49.757 --> 19:51.058
Well, he's worked out
this technique

19:51.059 --> 19:52.926
where he
doesn't watch any of them.

19:52.927 --> 19:55.362

really well for him.

20:13.982 --> 20:16.617
I don't want you
to get in trouble,

20:16.618 --> 20:17.818
because the truth is,

20:17.819 --> 20:19.720
Jimmy did want us
to come by

20:19.721 --> 20:21.222
and say what's up,
you know?

20:21.223 --> 20:23.056

just get us in

20:23.057 --> 20:24.125
for two minutes--

20:24.126 --> 20:25.192
I can do that.

20:25.193 --> 20:26.227
You can do that.

20:26.228 --> 20:27.261
I can do that,

20:27.262 --> 20:28.829
but I'm not
going to do that,

20:28.830 --> 20:31.064
because I don't want to,

20:31.065 --> 20:34.635
and I just can't seem
to find my way around that.

20:34.636 --> 20:35.736
I'm sorry.

20:35.737 --> 20:36.870

wish you guys

in the world,

20:39.007 --> 20:40.307

you know?

20:43.978 --> 20:45.179

really any good,

will find you.

21:10.805 --> 21:12.105
We're going on tour.

21:12.106 --> 21:13.440
When do we leave?

21:13.441 --> 21:14.441
Wait a second,
did somebody see our tapes?

21:14.442 --> 21:15.442
Whose team
are we on?

21:15.443 --> 21:16.443
Uh-uh. Hold on.

21:16.444 --> 21:18.145
Hold on.

21:18.146 --> 21:21.482
Live for your
viewing pleasure,

21:21.483 --> 21:25.152
we are Super Duper Skates.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.453
Dear Lord, Eric.

21:26.454 --> 21:27.621
I am never, ever

21:27.622 --> 21:29.356
going to wear that.

21:29.357 --> 21:31.525
The whole thing
sort of sounds sketchy.

21:31.526 --> 21:32.993
I'm sorry.

21:32.994 --> 21:34.495
I never heard of this
Super Duper Skates.

21:34.496 --> 21:35.929
Yeah, I know.

21:35.930 --> 21:37.665
That's because
I just made it up.

21:37.666 --> 21:40.133
Wake up
and smell the desperation.

21:40.134 --> 21:41.569
[MATT LAUGHS WILDLY]

21:41.570 --> 21:43.804
Dude, we needed a company name
to give us credibility on tour.

21:43.805 --> 21:44.805
On tour?

21:44.806 --> 21:45.906
That's right.

21:45.907 --> 21:46.907
We're hitting
the road

21:46.908 --> 21:48.309
as a team,
the three of us.

21:48.310 --> 21:49.810
We can skate better than
half of those guys anyway.

21:49.811 --> 21:50.877
Yeah, I can. It's weird.

21:50.878 --> 21:52.580
There you go.
Jimmy's a man, right?

21:52.581 --> 21:55.015
So once we're on the road,
we follow him around.

21:55.016 --> 21:56.717
All we've got to do
is get in front of him one time.

21:56.718 --> 21:58.252
He'll see we're the real deal.

21:58.253 --> 22:00.521
That does sound
super-duper.

22:00.522 --> 22:03.023
But I really don't...

22:03.024 --> 22:05.426
I mean, I'm just saying,
if you think about it...

22:05.427 --> 22:06.527
No, it's cool.
It's cool.

22:06.528 --> 22:08.262
You two can sit here
and touch yourselves

22:08.263 --> 22:09.663
for the rest
of your lives--

22:09.664 --> 22:10.731
I don't care--

22:10.732 --> 22:12.333
or you can try
getting off your asses

22:12.334 --> 22:13.701
and making it happen.

22:13.702 --> 22:16.570
That's about a nine
on the Richter scale, man.

22:16.571 --> 22:19.039
I think what he's saying is,
we've got a nest egg here,

22:19.040 --> 22:21.408
and we're
extraordinarily comfortable.

22:25.313 --> 22:26.580
Slug Bug!

22:29.050 --> 22:30.884
Mr. Rivers!

22:32.954 --> 22:36.490
Slug Bug!

22:36.491 --> 22:38.859
Mr. Rivers.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.261
Kids dig me.

22:40.262 --> 22:41.295
When's her lease up?

22:41.296 --> 22:42.496
Hey, man, where's all the money

22:42.497 --> 22:44.231
that we're going to use
on this trip

22:44.232 --> 22:45.766
coming from?

22:50.938 --> 22:52.606
Please stop looking at me.

22:52.607 --> 22:54.375
Dude, you can do this.
You have no choice.

22:54.376 --> 22:56.109
I absolutely am not doing it.
I can't.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.110
You can.

22:57.111 --> 22:59.012
No. Don't even talk... I'm not.

22:59.013 --> 23:00.914
There's no way in hell
I'm doing it.

23:00.915 --> 23:02.616
What?

23:02.617 --> 23:06.754
Now that the money issue
is settled,

23:06.755 --> 23:08.221
where are we going
to get some wheels?

23:08.222 --> 23:09.790
We've just got to find a van.

23:09.791 --> 23:12.058
I've got it!

23:12.059 --> 23:14.861
Oh!

23:17.499 --> 23:19.966
Ow! Ow!

23:27.008 --> 23:28.542
That was my mom's.

23:28.543 --> 23:31.945
This was actually my grandma's,
this little bellybutton ring.

23:31.946 --> 23:33.246
It's crazy.

23:33.247 --> 23:34.781
That's so sweet.

23:34.782 --> 23:37.017
I like the way you guys smell.

23:37.018 --> 23:38.251
Sweet Lou...

23:38.252 --> 23:39.553
See you girls later.

23:39.554 --> 23:40.554
What's going on, brother?

23:40.555 --> 23:41.588
What's up, fool?

23:41.589 --> 23:42.656
How are you guys doing?

23:42.657 --> 23:44.391
Doing good, man.

23:44.392 --> 23:45.626
Matt Jensen.

23:45.627 --> 23:47.694
Good to see you guys.

23:47.695 --> 23:49.129
So, dude, listen,

23:49.130 --> 23:50.998
we're thinking about joining
the Jimmy Wilson Tour.

23:50.999 --> 23:52.599
Really?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.001
Yeah, it's going
to be pretty phat.

23:54.002 --> 23:55.068
We need a fourth
skater for our team,

23:55.069 --> 23:56.136
so we were thinking
about you.

23:56.137 --> 23:58.371
Naturally, but, uh...

23:58.372 --> 24:00.007
Sweet Lou's
got everything he needs

24:00.008 --> 24:01.207
right here.

24:01.208 --> 24:04.110
What? Okay.
Dude, we're going cross-country.

24:04.111 --> 24:06.379
You know what that means.

24:06.380 --> 24:07.548
Yeah.

24:07.549 --> 24:09.016
Yeah, you do.

24:12.654 --> 24:14.454
No. What does that mean?

24:14.455 --> 24:16.523
Dude,
chicks in different area codes.

24:16.524 --> 24:18.358
Uncharted territory.

24:18.359 --> 24:21.828
¶ I got pros
I got pros ¶

24:21.829 --> 24:23.830
You know what
I'm saying?

24:23.831 --> 24:26.967
It's tempting, but...

24:26.968 --> 24:29.502
I don't know.

24:29.503 --> 24:31.504
You know, school
just let out and all.

24:31.505 --> 24:34.407
Didn't you graduate
like six years ago?

24:34.408 --> 24:36.242
Yeah...

24:36.243 --> 24:38.845
but they didn't.

24:38.846 --> 24:39.913
Hi.

24:39.914 --> 24:41.648
Again, a good point.

24:43.484 --> 24:45.018
Well...

24:45.019 --> 24:47.588
You know,
maybe it's none of my business

24:47.589 --> 24:49.089
or anything,

24:49.090 --> 24:51.725
but don't you think
maybe you should move on?

24:51.726 --> 24:53.794
You know,
a little change?

24:53.795 --> 24:55.862
It's just too easy,
sitting here year after year,

24:55.863 --> 24:58.298
watching the new crop roll in,

24:58.299 --> 24:59.633
and me just taking my pick.

24:59.634 --> 25:02.836
Besides, my calendar's
already pretty booked.

25:02.837 --> 25:03.870
You saw
those two Betties

25:03.871 --> 25:05.171
that were here
before?

25:05.172 --> 25:07.307
They're just my Tuesday.

25:07.308 --> 25:09.610
You should see Friday.

25:09.611 --> 25:11.011
Hmm.

25:11.012 --> 25:12.479
Yeah, we should
hang out.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.280
You guys have fun
on your little road trip,

25:14.281 --> 25:16.016
but count me out, all right?

25:17.752 --> 25:18.919
All right, man.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.020
Well, I'm going to miss you.

25:20.021 --> 25:21.588
Hey, Lou.

25:21.589 --> 25:22.623
Hey, Wednesday.

25:22.624 --> 25:24.557
It's Sandy.

25:24.558 --> 25:27.227
Right.

25:27.228 --> 25:28.528
I've been trying you all day.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.730
Sandy, chill.

25:29.731 --> 25:31.898
I told you I'd call you.

25:31.899 --> 25:33.533
Wednesday.

25:33.534 --> 25:35.468
Don't get
so extended.

25:35.469 --> 25:37.771
What's up, baby?
Matt Jensen.

25:37.772 --> 25:41.474
Um, I'm okay with that
and everything,

25:41.475 --> 25:42.876
but my dad's crazed.

25:42.877 --> 25:44.077
You told your dad?

25:44.078 --> 25:45.112
Yeah.

25:45.113 --> 25:46.212
He says he's going to kill you

25:46.213 --> 25:47.313
and then dangle your balls

25:47.314 --> 25:48.715
from his rear-view
mirror.

25:50.785 --> 25:52.653
Daddy!

25:59.761 --> 26:00.827
What's the first stop?

26:00.828 --> 26:02.863
Wait, you're in?

26:05.466 --> 26:06.733
Daddy, don't hurt him!

26:06.734 --> 26:08.068
Please!

26:10.404 --> 26:12.472
Call me!

26:12.473 --> 26:14.174
Bye, Lou!

26:14.175 --> 26:15.408
Call me on
Wednesday, okay?

26:18.813 --> 26:21.080
¶ You never see
Another like me ¶

26:21.081 --> 26:24.584
¶ Redneck hippie white boy
From the I.E. ¶

26:24.585 --> 26:26.486
¶ I'm half man and half monkey ¶

26:26.487 --> 26:29.389
¶ One-quarter space cowboy
And punk M.C. ¶

26:29.390 --> 26:32.726
One more thing, dude.

26:32.727 --> 26:34.928
¶ Just like peanut butter
Thick and chunky ¶

26:34.929 --> 26:37.597

Roll in on a donkey ¶

26:37.598 --> 26:40.500
¶ Love, peace, and harmony ¶

26:40.501 --> 26:42.803
¶ Just trying to find
Some peace of mind ¶

26:42.804 --> 26:45.472
¶ I'm looking hard
But it's taking time ¶

26:45.473 --> 26:48.442
¶ Having fun
Kickin' and bustin' rhymes ¶

26:48.443 --> 26:50.744
Not bad.

26:53.815 --> 26:55.048
Van Gogh.

26:58.185 --> 27:00.454
Let's roll.

27:00.455 --> 27:01.988
Cool,

27:01.989 --> 27:03.623
except Dustin was supposed
to be here what,

27:03.624 --> 27:04.658
a half-hour ago?

27:12.367 --> 27:13.367
What about my overtime?

27:13.368 --> 27:14.368
You don't need it.

27:14.369 --> 27:15.369
What about college?

27:15.370 --> 27:16.670
Consider this
your full ride.

27:16.671 --> 27:19.005
Then I need to go back
and get my special pillow, Eric.

27:19.006 --> 27:20.474
Get inside!

27:23.578 --> 27:25.445
Excuse me, Mr. Knight.
Your shift is not over!

27:25.446 --> 27:26.646
You have not punched out,
Mr. Knight!

27:26.647 --> 27:30.417
Mr. Knight!

27:30.418 --> 27:32.018
MATT: Where are we going?

27:32.019 --> 27:33.487
Jimmy Wilson's skating
the Pro-Am contest

27:33.488 --> 27:34.554
in Kansas.

27:34.555 --> 27:35.722
It's our first stop.

27:37.358 --> 27:38.958
¶ Yeah, my nigga fly dog ¶

27:38.959 --> 27:40.894
¶ Hey, dog, hey, dog
Hey, dog, hey, dog ¶

27:40.895 --> 27:43.530
¶ I been all around
The world ¶

27:43.531 --> 27:45.532
¶ I don't roll with nobody
But my dogs ¶

27:45.533 --> 27:47.133
¶ I been all around

27:47.134 --> 27:50.203
¶ I don't roll with nobody
But my dogs ¶

27:50.204 --> 27:53.306
¶ I been all around
The world... ¶

27:53.307 --> 27:55.275
Damn, it smells
like roses.

27:55.276 --> 27:58.278
I done farted!

27:58.279 --> 28:01.247
Hey, why you always
got to base in my face, fool?

28:01.248 --> 28:02.783
Yo, yo, check it.

28:02.784 --> 28:03.983
¶ Base in your face ¶

28:03.984 --> 28:06.052
¶ This brother's fart
Stinks like Mace ¶

28:08.890 --> 28:11.057
All right, Kansas,
are you ready to go big?

28:11.058 --> 28:12.492
I knew you knew
who I was!

28:12.493 --> 28:14.394
You saw that
front cover, baby.

28:14.395 --> 28:15.962
Watch out, son.

28:15.963 --> 28:17.931
Yo, yo, yo, I know you wannabes

28:17.932 --> 28:19.633
are not here
to skate.

28:19.634 --> 28:21.401
What's up,
white chocolate?

28:21.402 --> 28:23.269
Don't be talking
no head, fool.

28:23.270 --> 28:25.338
Hey, Red Crip,
tell them what's up.

28:25.339 --> 28:26.406
Yeah, I'm feeling
to bust you

28:26.407 --> 28:27.407
in your grills.

28:27.408 --> 28:29.108
Yeah, in your grills, dog!

28:29.109 --> 28:30.610
Our grills?

28:30.611 --> 28:32.712
Is there some sort
of barbecue later?

28:32.713 --> 28:34.781
So the party's

28:34.782 --> 28:35.782
at Rolling Deuce tonight.

28:35.783 --> 28:37.283
It should be pretty cool.

28:37.284 --> 28:38.351
Sounds cool.

28:38.352 --> 28:39.686
She's talking
to Matt Ball, dude.

28:41.823 --> 28:43.657
All right, no worries.

28:43.658 --> 28:45.058
I got this
under control.

28:45.059 --> 28:46.359
Hey, how are you?

28:46.360 --> 28:47.461
Good.

28:47.462 --> 28:48.562
Eric Rivers,

28:48.563 --> 28:50.096
with the Super Duper
Skate team.

28:50.097 --> 28:51.698
Oh, that's cute. Super Duper?

28:51.699 --> 28:52.899
That's great.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.133
Yeah, it's great.

28:54.134 --> 28:56.636
Um, wait.

28:56.637 --> 28:58.772
You're not registered.

28:58.773 --> 29:00.807
Oh, no, I'm sure we're on there.

29:00.808 --> 29:01.875
We're sponsored, so...

29:01.876 --> 29:03.577
Okay.

29:03.578 --> 29:05.044
I'm sorry.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.713
If you're not preregistered,
you can't skate this event.

29:06.714 --> 29:07.747
Next!

29:07.748 --> 29:08.782
No, no, no, no.

29:08.783 --> 29:09.816
All right, look,

29:09.817 --> 29:10.884
this is our first event
as a team,

29:10.885 --> 29:12.619
and we just drove all
the way from Chicago,

29:12.620 --> 29:15.121
and I basically kidnapped
my best friend here, okay?

29:15.122 --> 29:16.990
And blew his only
shot at college,

29:16.991 --> 29:20.059
so if you could find some way
to make the list work,

29:20.060 --> 29:22.328
we'd be really thankful.

29:22.329 --> 29:23.563
You know what?

29:23.564 --> 29:25.699
Tell your sob story
someplace else.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.933
We're all full up here.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.067
Next.

29:29.604 --> 29:32.873
Next!

29:32.874 --> 29:34.340
Let me get in here.

29:34.341 --> 29:35.575
I can't believe
they've never heard

29:35.576 --> 29:36.810
of Super Duper Skates.

29:36.811 --> 29:38.778
That's just
a freaking outrage.

29:38.779 --> 29:40.313
All right,

29:40.314 --> 29:41.314
well, let's go
skate the parking lot

29:41.315 --> 29:42.482
and wait Jimmy out.

29:42.483 --> 29:44.350
Don't be so harsh, mama.

your only copy of the tape.

01:07:26.662 --> 01:07:28.929
Oh...

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.098
somebody broke the tour rule.

01:07:31.099 --> 01:07:32.300
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix this.

01:07:32.301 --> 01:07:33.467
Let's get out of here.

01:07:33.468 --> 01:07:35.603
Who did number two
on the bus, man?

01:07:35.604 --> 01:07:38.105
How many times
do I have to tell them?

01:07:38.106 --> 01:07:40.308
No going number two on my bus!

ERIC: So, I don't know,

01:07:46.515 --> 01:07:48.882
basically we've
been following

01:07:48.883 --> 01:07:50.951
the Jimmy Wilson Tour
all over the country.

01:07:50.952 --> 01:07:52.453
That's insane.

01:07:52.454 --> 01:07:53.554
Yeah. It sucks.

01:07:53.555 --> 01:07:55.489
I mean, I had this
whole thing planned out.

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:57.491
All we had to do,
get in front of him,

01:07:57.492 --> 01:07:59.059
and it was so easy.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.127
You know, he just
had to see us skate,

01:08:00.128 --> 01:08:01.562
and he'd pick us up,

01:08:01.563 --> 01:08:05.032
but of course,

01:08:05.033 --> 01:08:08.236
we found a way
to screw everything up

01:08:08.237 --> 01:08:10.705
and the whole thing
has turned into a disaster.

01:08:10.706 --> 01:08:13.140
Yeah, well,
you can't argue with talent,

01:08:13.141 --> 01:08:16.377
so just keep skating,

01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:19.680
and someone will find you.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.415
I know about these things.

01:08:21.416 --> 01:08:22.617
You must.

01:08:25.754 --> 01:08:27.388
I guess,
by the way things went down,

01:08:27.389 --> 01:08:30.957
you guys have probably
been hooking up for a while now.

01:08:30.959 --> 01:08:34.595
You think I'm into Bam
because he's on tour?

01:08:34.595 --> 01:08:36.363
I don't know.

01:08:36.365 --> 01:08:39.367
I thought that's how things went
around here.

01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:42.903
Everyone hung out with the pros
and did their thing.

01:08:47.908 --> 01:08:49.377
I really didn't
mean it like that.

01:08:49.377 --> 01:08:51.178
I...

01:08:51.179 --> 01:08:55.249
It's just, you know,
you're super cute.

01:08:56.718 --> 01:09:00.453
I mean, I'd throw myself
under the wheels of Jimmy's bus

01:09:00.455 --> 01:09:02.657
to get a chance to be
with a girl like you.

Eric, check it out.

01:09:14.502 --> 01:09:15.703
We just
got on Jimmy Wilson's bus,

01:09:15.703 --> 01:09:16.804
and Matt took a big crap on it.

01:09:16.805 --> 01:09:18.104

01:09:18.106 --> 01:09:21.108
if it was the stroganoff
or what, but I was like...

01:09:24.179 --> 01:09:25.245
and we're leaving
right now,

01:09:25.246 --> 01:09:26.714
so let's go.

01:09:26.715 --> 01:09:29.049

looks like He-Man.

Sure.

to wrestle down to the ground.

do now, man?

going to stop?

you feel like.

run over there,

"This is our last shot."

01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:03.696
No matter
what happens,

01:28:03.697 --> 01:28:04.731
I'm so glad

01:28:04.732 --> 01:28:05.965
that you guys
stuck with me.

01:28:05.966 --> 01:28:08.435
I'm glad we did this together.

01:28:08.436 --> 01:28:09.569
We've had a ride,
all right.

01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:10.637
That we have.

01:28:10.638 --> 01:28:12.672
Bro, you got me
out of your garage,

01:28:12.673 --> 01:28:14.407
you got me
talking to the clowns again,

01:28:14.408 --> 01:28:15.809
chicks are starting
to look at me...

01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:16.976
That's because

01:28:16.977 --> 01:28:19.979
you don't smell
like anus anymore.

01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:22.882
I'm pretty pissed
that I'm broke,

01:28:22.883 --> 01:28:24.283
but it was definitely
worth the money

01:28:24.284 --> 01:28:25.652
to be here,

01:28:25.653 --> 01:28:28.054
even if we choke
out there.

01:28:30.624 --> 01:28:33.059
I love you, Eric.

01:28:34.929 --> 01:28:35.962
Ow!

01:28:35.963 --> 01:28:37.396
Why did you do that?

01:28:37.397 --> 01:28:38.431
I'm psyching
you up, dude.

01:28:38.432 --> 01:28:39.766
All right, Sweet Lou.

01:28:39.767 --> 01:28:40.900
Could you psych me up

01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:41.901
a little softer
next time?

01:28:41.902 --> 01:28:43.603
Sweet Lou,

01:28:43.604 --> 01:28:45.204
my sister wanted me
to give you this.

01:28:45.205 --> 01:28:47.907
It's her nose.

01:28:56.584 --> 01:28:58.417
All right, boys.

01:28:58.418 --> 01:29:00.553
Get on it.

01:29:00.554 --> 01:29:03.523
Santa Monica,
it is time to get busy,

01:29:03.524 --> 01:29:05.391
because next up,
we have four cats

01:29:05.392 --> 01:29:07.293
that you
might not have heard of.

01:29:07.294 --> 01:29:09.896
They are Eric Rivers,
Dustin Knight,

01:29:09.897 --> 01:29:12.064
Matt Jensen,
and Sweet Lou Singer,

01:29:12.065 --> 01:29:13.265
and you know what?

01:29:13.266 --> 01:29:14.601
If you haven't heard
of these kids,

01:29:14.602 --> 01:29:15.735
guess what.

01:29:15.736 --> 01:29:17.203
We are all in the same boat,

01:29:17.204 --> 01:29:19.405
but they are here,
they're ready to get busy.

01:29:19.406 --> 01:29:20.773
That's right.

01:29:20.774 --> 01:29:22.942
They are representing
Super Duper Skateboards.

01:29:22.943 --> 01:29:24.611
Let's take it to the street.

01:29:24.612 --> 01:29:27.113
¶ I think you bit off
More than you could chew ¶

01:29:27.114 --> 01:29:32.318
¶ And now it's time
To make a choice ¶

01:29:32.319 --> 01:29:35.187
¶ And all I want to hear
Is your ¶

01:29:35.188 --> 01:29:40.960
¶ So follow the leader down ¶

01:29:40.961 --> 01:29:45.297
¶ And swallow your pride
And drown ¶

01:29:45.298 --> 01:29:51.738
¶ When there's no place
Left to go ¶

01:29:51.739 --> 01:29:53.940
¶ Maybe that's
When you will know ¶

01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:59.078
¶ Follow the leader down ¶

01:29:59.079 --> 01:30:04.183
¶ And swallow your pride
And drown ¶

01:30:04.184 --> 01:30:10.590
¶ When there's no place
Left to go ¶

01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:12.258
¶ Maybe that's
When you will know ¶

01:30:22.937 --> 01:30:26.072
¶ And foolish lies ¶

01:30:26.073 --> 01:30:31.678
¶ Well, can't you see
I tried to compromise? ¶

01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:36.049
¶ And what you said, now ¶

01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:42.288
¶ And what I do
To get through to you ¶

01:30:42.289 --> 01:30:45.191
¶ But you'd only do it again ¶

01:30:45.192 --> 01:30:50.496
¶ So follow the leader down ¶

01:30:50.497 --> 01:30:56.202
¶ And swallow your pride
And drown ¶

¶ When there's no place
Left to go ¶

01:31:00.273 --> 01:31:03.076
Oh, God.
What's up?

01:31:03.077 --> 01:31:04.510
Just keeping
an eye out

01:31:04.511 --> 01:31:06.145
for something
special.

01:31:06.146 --> 01:31:07.146
You see something
you like?

01:31:07.147 --> 01:31:08.982
Maybe.

01:31:08.983 --> 01:31:11.517
Oh, my God.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.434
What's up, dog?

01:31:28.435 --> 01:31:30.103
Didn't I tell you
to break out, fool?

01:31:30.104 --> 01:31:31.370
I just don't
like you, fool.

01:31:31.371 --> 01:31:32.939
Bounce.

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.842
You know what?

01:31:35.843 --> 01:31:36.909
What?

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:37.944
You and me.

01:31:37.945 --> 01:31:40.713
Oh, hells yeah!
Get him, dog!

01:31:40.714 --> 01:31:42.548
MATT:
He's going to hand you
your ass, punk.

01:31:42.549 --> 01:31:43.750
You going to take
that side?

01:31:43.751 --> 01:31:44.917
All right.

01:32:39.073 --> 01:32:41.007
¶ I never knew
That a kid like me ¶

01:32:41.008 --> 01:32:42.408
¶ Could take his mike
Around the world ¶

01:32:42.409 --> 01:32:43.843
¶ And flash the big S.D. ¶

01:32:43.844 --> 01:32:46.512
¶ And rock the masses
From Madrid to Calabasas ¶

01:32:46.513 --> 01:32:48.314
¶ Tijuana, Mexico

'Cause I be puttin' in work ¶

¶ And I'm sure you heard ¶

01:32:55.723 --> 01:32:57.256
¶ About a new sound
Going around ¶

01:32:57.257 --> 01:32:59.692
¶ She might have left my hood
But she was born in my town ¶

01:32:59.693 --> 01:33:01.094
¶ You didn't know ¶

01:33:01.095 --> 01:33:03.162
¶ Thought we was
New on the scene ¶

01:33:03.163 --> 01:33:04.697

¶ I'm not running off my mouth
I know this without a doubt ¶

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.253
¶ 'Cause if you know
These streets ¶

01:33:27.254 --> 01:33:29.355
¶ Then these streets know you ¶

01:33:29.356 --> 01:33:30.356

01:38:12.372 --> 01:38:13.839
That counts for something, huh?

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.241
Hell, yeah, it does.

01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:16.509
Oh, by the way, guys,

01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:18.010
I think I'm done
playing the field.

01:38:18.011 --> 01:38:19.245
Yeah, right.

01:38:19.246 --> 01:38:20.712
No, Sweet Lou's
in love.

01:38:20.713 --> 01:38:22.415
It's crazy, I know.

01:38:22.416 --> 01:38:23.916
They're clowns.

01:38:23.917 --> 01:38:26.218
You were so good!

01:38:26.219 --> 01:38:27.753
I didn't know you could
skateboard like that.

01:38:27.754 --> 01:38:31.023
You're all really great.

01:38:31.024 --> 01:38:32.858

Jimmy saw us.

Sorry, man.

I've got to get back
to my dad's shop

01:38:44.337 --> 01:38:46.905
and mix some paint.

01:38:46.906 --> 01:38:48.774
Have you talked
to Jamie lately?

01:38:48.775 --> 01:38:51.377
Yeah, I got a hold of her
last weekend.

01:38:51.378 --> 01:38:53.312
She was up in Toronto somewhere.

01:38:53.313 --> 01:38:55.147
It's just so freaking hard
to track her down

01:38:55.148 --> 01:38:57.283
when she's here, there,
and everywhere.

01:38:57.284 --> 01:38:58.484
Oh, oh, oh.

01:38:58.485 --> 01:39:01.387
Dude, Sweet Lou
called me yesterday.

01:39:01.388 --> 01:39:02.588
No way.

01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:03.622
Yeah.

01:39:03.623 --> 01:39:04.656
How's he liking the circus?

01:39:04.657 --> 01:39:06.392
He's loving
the circus.

01:39:06.393 --> 01:39:07.726
I can't believe

01:39:07.727 --> 01:39:08.894
that dude's
in the circus

01:39:08.895 --> 01:39:10.028
with my sister.

01:39:10.029 --> 01:39:11.597
Yeah, he's pulling
her finger

01:39:11.598 --> 01:39:13.566
as we speak.

01:39:13.567 --> 01:39:14.967
Seriously, though,

01:39:14.968 --> 01:39:16.702
I mean, you can't say
this wasn't a good summer.

01:39:16.703 --> 01:39:17.769
Dude, I mean,
we tried,

01:39:17.770 --> 01:39:18.870
and that's more

01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:20.473
than most people
can say.

Whoa.

01:39:35.622 --> 01:39:36.855
Hey, guys.

01:39:36.856 --> 01:39:38.890
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:39:38.891 --> 01:39:40.593
I brought someone
who wants to meet you.

01:39:40.594 --> 01:39:42.194
So I saw this tape on my bus,

01:39:42.195 --> 01:39:44.497
and Jamie here sat me down
and made me watch it.

01:39:44.498 --> 01:39:46.232
I realized you were
the same guys

01:39:46.233 --> 01:39:47.899
pulling some sick stuff
out in Santa Monica.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.269
He found a tape
on the bus.

01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:51.470
What do you know?

01:39:51.471 --> 01:39:53.805
Would you guys
like to join me on tour?

01:39:55.074 --> 01:39:58.110
What?

01:39:58.111 --> 01:39:59.278
Yes, we will.

01:40:08.955 --> 01:40:12.358
Find out.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.174
Rivers, seriously,

01:40:28.175 --> 01:40:29.841
please, while
we're young.

01:40:35.982 --> 01:40:38.184
You know, bro, I know
your board's all cracked up,

01:40:38.185 --> 01:40:39.818
but you've got to start
spending money,

01:40:39.819 --> 01:40:41.620
because money-spending's good.

01:40:41.621 --> 01:40:42.954
Oh, Eric!

01:40:42.955 --> 01:40:44.823
Good to see you, bro.

01:40:44.824 --> 01:40:45.991
Big love.

01:40:45.992 --> 01:40:47.359
You too, bro. You too.
Hey, listen,

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.494
I'm going to need
a bunch of my decks.

01:40:48.495 --> 01:40:49.495
Yeah, I could do that.

01:40:49.496 --> 01:40:50.496
Cool, cool.

01:40:58.171 --> 01:40:59.305
Cool, dude.

down in Springfield.

Thanks.

Cool.

Your board's
pretty thrashed.

01:41:14.321 --> 01:41:15.387
There you go.

Yeah.

Yo, why don't you direct
your way to the 40s,

all right?
