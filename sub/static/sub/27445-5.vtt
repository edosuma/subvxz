WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:08.209
Better Things, all new.
Thursdays at 10:00.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.744
Starts February 28 on FX.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.350
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.262
*

00:32.533 --> 00:35.035
Checking in with us today?

00:41.309 --> 00:43.677
Okay, Miss Cutler.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.114
Looks like we have you in one
of our signature suites.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.748
Will you be needing
one room key or two?

00:47.781 --> 00:49.917
One's fine.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.853
* Waiting in line *

00:52.886 --> 00:56.757
* Thought about leaving *

00:56.790 --> 00:59.293
* But for real this time *

00:59.327 --> 01:02.563
* Some redesign *

01:02.596 --> 01:06.267
* Of a classic theme *

01:06.300 --> 01:10.238
* Of western scene *

01:18.612 --> 01:20.848
* What everyone wants *

01:22.616 --> 01:24.318
* Is the same thing *

01:24.352 --> 01:27.588
* That everyone wants *

01:27.621 --> 01:31.292
* What do you want to be? *

01:35.663 --> 01:36.964
All right.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.433
Are any of these
popular disc jockeys

01:39.467 --> 01:41.068
worthy of playing our wedding?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.003
Uh, DJ Duchess?

01:43.036 --> 01:46.240
DJ Squirt
Brian?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.142
Who cares?

01:48.176 --> 01:50.344
We could put a blonde wig and
a Givenchy shirt on an iPhone

01:50.378 --> 01:52.180
and no one would
know the difference.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.282
The DJ will be the first person

01:54.315 --> 01:56.684
to introduce us
as a married couple.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.686
Do you really want to hand
that responsibility

01:58.719 --> 02:01.189
to DJ Thugtastic?

02:01.222 --> 02:04.458
Nock Nock?
Who's Nock Nock?

02:04.492 --> 02:07.661
And how does he have
six million views?

02:07.695 --> 02:11.265
-* Ring around the clocky *
-* Ring around the clocky *

02:11.299 --> 02:13.934
-* Pocket full of Oxy *
-* Pocket full of Oxy *

02:13.967 --> 02:16.537
-* Mom could never stop me *
-* Mom could never stop me *

02:16.570 --> 02:19.473
I think this is trash?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.942
But is it
"garbage trash" or, like,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.011
"trash that ends up
in a museum" trash?

02:24.044 --> 02:25.779
No, no.
It's rubbish.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.182
-Right.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.384
I mean, he's just
some Ox'd-out redneck

02:30.418 --> 02:32.586
rapping behind an Arby's
or something.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.324
-Yes, please.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.828
-* Ring around the clocky *
-* Ring around the clocky. *

02:40.861 --> 02:44.164
Well, we have had a shockingly
productive morning.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.300
We have booked our cake tasting,

02:46.334 --> 02:48.135
finalized booze selections,

02:48.168 --> 02:50.638
low-balled our officiant,
and tonight,

02:50.671 --> 02:54.208
-we have an appointment
with our florist.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.577
-This wedding's about to be
classy as fuck.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.347
Right.
Time to head off to write.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.515
I mustn't keep the muse waiting.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.051
Yes, hurry up. Wouldn't want to
lose the table near the outlet.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.421
-Come on.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.257
You're a reg at a coffee shop

03:09.290 --> 03:11.325
with a reg outlet
and reg writing hours.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.727
Plus, running point
on all this wedding shit--

03:13.761 --> 03:17.798
you've just become this, like,
stable-ass dude alla sudden.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.934
Stable?

03:20.968 --> 03:23.537
Yeah, I always thought the whole
point of being a writer

03:23.571 --> 03:26.006
was so that you could drink
all night in dive bars

03:26.039 --> 03:28.909
and challenge other writers to
fist fights and die hella early.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.911
But not you, Jimmy.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.180
You, sir, are a VGB:

03:33.213 --> 03:34.748
A very good boy.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.250
I'm not a...

03:36.284 --> 03:38.586
I am the opposite
of a good boy.

03:38.619 --> 03:42.055
I may have experienced
a marked level of success

03:42.089 --> 03:43.524
as of late, but that
doesn't change the fact

03:43.557 --> 03:45.025
that Jimmy Shive-Overly

03:45.058 --> 03:47.227
is and will always be,
unassailably,

03:47.261 --> 03:50.097
without question,
a bad, bad boy.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.232
Name one thing
that makes you a bad boy.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.201
I have a raging foot fetish.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.304
Foot fetishes are the applesauce
of fetishes.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.071
Bad boy fetishes are like

03:58.105 --> 04:00.441
you can only get turned on
if your dick's on fire.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.744
What are you still doing here?
You're gonna lose your outlet.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.646
Jimmy thinks he's a bad boy.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.918
What... what gives Edgar
the right to weigh in on this?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.786
Jimmy, Edgar has killed people.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.555
What is more bad boy than that?

04:16.290 --> 04:19.593
Oh. It's good.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.095
Everyone knows
you don't marry the bad boy.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.498
You bang him until he gets
caught knocking over

04:24.532 --> 04:27.067
a tattoo shop
he lost in a dice game.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.303
But marry him?
No way.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.238
That is what I have you for.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.841
Mm.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.242
Is that sunblock?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
Good boy.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.258
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

04:51.291 --> 04:54.294
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

04:54.328 --> 04:55.729
* Gonna leave you anyway. *

05:07.074 --> 05:09.076
*

05:28.028 --> 05:30.564
That was the mustard.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.600
Not my butt.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.003
You can eat in the meeting,
Gretchen.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.645
I mean, usually people
don't eat at these things,

05:44.678 --> 05:45.979
but, do you.
All right,

05:46.013 --> 05:47.815
time to pitch me new clients.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.517
Go.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.468
Mm-mm!

06:09.570 --> 06:11.639
Still on pace
for 28 pages today, Jimmy?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.543
No, actually.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.110
I'm just winging it today.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.413
Who cares about page goals?

06:19.447 --> 06:21.381
You, bruh?

06:21.415 --> 06:23.350
You asked me to
"shame you mightily"

06:23.383 --> 06:25.753
if you don't make your page goal
every day. You good, fam?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.688
Yeah, I'm completely good, fam.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.356
Oh, it's just that my fiancée

06:29.389 --> 06:31.859
accused me of being a good boy.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.694
Preposterous.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.228
That is decaf, right?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.998
Just... I don't want
the afternoon jitters.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.449
Mind watching my stuff
while I hit the bathroom?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.697
Yeah! Yeah!

07:22.710 --> 07:24.812
Thanks.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.982
His music is fantastic.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.984
His brand is ripe
for developing.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.420
And his numbers speak
for themselves.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.489
When I saw Young Bludgeon
a few years ago,

07:35.523 --> 07:38.792
I felt he was talented, but
derivative of Lil Uzi Vert,

07:38.826 --> 07:41.695
which is to say I am not
interested in this at all,

07:41.729 --> 07:43.463
and neither should you be.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.600
Thanks for that complete waste
of time, Shayna.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.168
Gretchen.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.871
Mm
Mm-hmm.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.443
Well, two words for you.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.146
Actually, one word, twice.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.214
Also, not spelled
the way you'd think.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.516
Anyway,

08:02.550 --> 08:05.352
Nock... Nock.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.120
Who's there?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.890
Yes, exactly.
Nock Nock is there.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.325
Nock Nock is
a trailer park rapper

08:12.359 --> 08:15.362
who only raps about drugs
and his mom. And eating pussy.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.965
-Very fresh talent.
-Pull him up on the screen.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.601
Oh, we can do that later.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.137
YVETTE:
Huh.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.139
Anybody heard of him?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.041
Well,

08:28.075 --> 08:30.510
how 'bout we all get to know
Nock Nock today?

08:30.544 --> 08:32.512
All of us

08:32.546 --> 08:35.248
Watch every video,
listen to every song.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.350
Comb through
his online presence to see

08:37.384 --> 08:40.187
if you brought us someone
who's worth our time.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.923
Rony really vouched for you
on this promotion,

08:42.956 --> 08:46.359
so I am looking forward
to seeing what the hype...

08:46.393 --> 08:47.961
is about.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.631
Meeting's done.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.573
*

09:04.244 --> 09:05.613
Did you hear that?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.280
No. You know what else
I don't hear?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.182
The sound of me jizzing yet.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.051
-Aah!

09:11.084 --> 09:12.085
-Oh!
-Noice!

09:12.119 --> 09:13.954
Sweet balls, E.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.589
Ew! You two.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.690
Get a room.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.292
I am in my... sheet room.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.061
Linds, grateful
you're letting us crash,

09:21.094 --> 09:23.363
but we can only kill so much
time at the 99 Cents Store.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.265
It's fun, but then a huge bummer
all of a sudden.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.900
Really sneaks up on you.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.036
Yo, what are you guys getting up
to the rest of the day?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.304
Ew! Get off!
Go back to your couch.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.940
Oh, don't forget,
Paul will be over soon

09:32.973 --> 09:35.142
to do the insemination
procedure.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.611
Paul's gonna come in a cup, and
we're gonna put that in her vag.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.446
Oh, Bec, Tiny People,
Big House is on.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.914
-Okay, babe.
: This week

09:40.948 --> 09:42.783
-on Tiny People, Big Houses,
-Ooh!

09:42.816 --> 09:44.151
-Kathy and Mark
: Ow.

09:44.184 --> 09:47.320
have difficulties
with their reimagined...

09:47.354 --> 09:48.622
How are we living in a world

09:48.656 --> 09:50.457
where Becca
loves her husband now?

09:50.490 --> 09:54.094
And how is that world
living inside my apartment?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.096
I need to find someone.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.497
Soon.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.166
You and I hang out all the time.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.234
We do sex all the time.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.237
I want a "feeds me cheese balls"

10:04.271 --> 10:05.673
type of love.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.642
Oh, no.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.744
You didn't catch feels, did you?

10:10.778 --> 10:13.080
We promised we'd kill the other
if that happened.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.082
Do I need to get
my stabbing knife out?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.750
No. No feels.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.585
But...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.520
I don't know,
what if we tried?

10:20.553 --> 10:22.289
Explain your words.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.857
What if, like,
we do what we're doing now

10:23.891 --> 10:27.194
but we moved it
to a restaurant and...

10:27.227 --> 10:30.363
you know, gave
catching feelings a shot?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.032
We do bone good.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.967
That's, like,
90% of a relationship.

10:34.001 --> 10:34.968
Let's do it!

10:35.002 --> 10:36.636
Let's go on a...

10:36.670 --> 10:38.972
da...

10:39.006 --> 10:40.841
DayQuil:
No, that's not a word.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.476
Uh, what's the word
for a no

10:43.510 --> 10:44.511
A date.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.612
Ew.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.181
That's it. A date.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.718
Lindsay, you're gonna
want to stay out of your

10:50.751 --> 10:52.552
underwear drawer
for a bit. Tallulah's

10:52.585 --> 10:54.521
taking a nap in there,
and she may or may not have

10:54.554 --> 10:56.123
sharted all over your thongs.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.658
No, she totally did.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.331
:
* Ring around the clocky *
* Ring around the clocky *

11:04.364 --> 11:07.200
-* Pocket full of Oxy *
:
Oh, she's dead.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.805
-* Pocket full of Oxy *
-* Catch me
at the football field *

11:11.839 --> 11:15.208
-* I'm cooking
mac and cheese, yeah *

11:15.242 --> 11:16.409
* I'm cooking all that mac
and cheese... *

11:16.443 --> 11:18.078
WOMAN:
This is the guy?

11:18.111 --> 11:20.247
MAN :
Oh, yeah, right.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.883
-* Ring around the clocky *
-* Ring around the clocky *

11:22.916 --> 11:25.018
* Pocket full of Oxy *

11:27.587 --> 11:29.923
-Aah!
-Yvette would like to get drinks
with you tonight,

11:29.957 --> 11:32.993
off-campus. I'll be in touch
with your office.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.862
Like, a fun drinks,

11:34.895 --> 11:37.731
-* Pussy like it's Cocoa Puffs *

11:39.767 --> 11:41.068
-* Oxy *
-* Oxy... *

11:58.051 --> 12:01.789
One street hot dog,
please, vendor.

12:14.001 --> 12:17.104
Why are you littering?

12:17.137 --> 12:19.706
Because I'm a bad boy.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.208
Do we need to find a grown

12:21.241 --> 12:22.609
What are you, five?

12:22.642 --> 12:24.644
Who calls adults "grown

12:24.677 --> 12:26.780
Piss off,
you meddling street urchins.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.581
Excuse me, grown-up.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.583
We need help.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.889
MAN:
I know, tell me about it.
Oh, I did not even

12:35.923 --> 12:38.291
tell you about
our trip to Montana.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.293
-Yeah, no, truly majestic.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.095
Big Sky Country.
Like, so humbling.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.098
I found myself. Best part was,
though, Lexi got sick

12:45.132 --> 12:46.566
on the second night,
so I was just out there

12:46.599 --> 12:49.469
bagging townies
left and right.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.947
(keys clacking,
sent message chime)

12:59.980 --> 13:01.681
Yeah, I know, it's like,
if you don't

13:01.714 --> 13:03.250
want to lose your pension,
then don't invest it

13:03.283 --> 13:04.952
in the first place,
Grandma.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.486
Yeah.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.122
Right? Yeah.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.725
-*

13:16.696 --> 13:18.932
Hold on, dude, I got
to hit this sick crosswalk.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.700
Um, so, anyway,
the reason I'm calling is,

13:20.733 --> 13:23.470
are you still dealing Molly?

13:23.503 --> 13:24.771
WOMAN :
We love to entertain, so...

13:24.804 --> 13:26.173
How you doin' in there, buddy?

13:26.206 --> 13:27.174
PAUL:
Fine.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.609
Uh, give me a minute.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.778
WOMAN:
...kitchen that overlooks
the large living room.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.680
MAN:
Yes, I do love to cook in it.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.219
You'd think
my reproductive anatomy

13:39.252 --> 13:40.854
would more than cooperate,

13:40.888 --> 13:42.689
considering I've refrained
from any emissions

13:42.722 --> 13:44.291
in two fortnights.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.247
Oh.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.988
Damn!
Great work, Paul.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.224
-It's like a full side of ranch.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.992
PAUL:
It's wondrous to think
that of the 400 million-odd

14:19.026 --> 14:22.095
sperm you're holding,
one mighty swimmer

14:22.129 --> 14:24.097
might become my future child.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.601
I'm up-squirting the specimen

14:28.635 --> 14:31.271
into the medical baster.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.008
Now I'm inserting
the medical baster

14:35.042 --> 14:36.843
into the vaginal canal.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.445
Oh. Ow!

14:38.478 --> 14:39.546
Relax, honey.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.581
Almost done, Paul.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.518
All right.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.754
You can come out now.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.792
May I?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.827
Oh.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.467
Implant, dear offspring.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.404
Father cannot wait to meet you.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.380
I can't believe it's been
four months and no fetus.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.249
My last sperm test revealed
I had historic motility.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.651
It's my "offish" doctor's
opinion this is absolutely,

15:18.685 --> 15:20.820
-possibly the one.
-And if not,

15:20.853 --> 15:23.390
there's always next month.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.625
Do you need a pen
to write the check or...

15:25.658 --> 15:28.228
Becca!
This is a sacred moment.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.297
You mind scribblin'
that five thou to "cash"?

15:30.330 --> 15:33.700
Bec and I could really use
the walkin' around money.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.442
Question.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.747
How did you get hired
in the first place?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.818
Look, I know.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.586
I was just a coked-out assistant

15:53.620 --> 15:55.822
who spent most of her time
hooking up with industry guys

15:55.855 --> 15:57.991
and stealing iPod Shuffles
from swag bags.

15:58.025 --> 16:01.794
But then Rick was decapitated
in that Jet Ski accident,

16:01.828 --> 16:05.698
and, suddenly, I got
a promotion I never asked for.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.201
And now, here I am,
three years later,

16:08.235 --> 16:11.038
getting married, pretending
to be a real publicist

16:11.071 --> 16:13.806
in my big office, which,
yeah, I stole.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.209
Which triggered another
promotion I didn't ask for.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.646
And I am a total fraud, okay?

16:19.679 --> 16:22.549
All I do is lie
and manipulate my clients

16:22.582 --> 16:24.617
into doing
what I want them to do.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.653
You just described
being a publicist.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.190
Yeah, anyways,
thanks for doing this off-campus

16:30.223 --> 16:32.525
to let me save face.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.661
Say bye to Toilet for me.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.695
Sit.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.567
God, you remind me
so much of me.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.802
It's true. I was just

16:42.835 --> 16:45.238
some rich girl
who liked to fuck musicians.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.873
Yes.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.675
I didn't take this job
seriously, either.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.544
Until one day I woke up
and decided I wanted

16:51.578 --> 16:53.046
to be good at something
other than

16:53.080 --> 16:55.014
avoiding being good
at anything.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.484
The only thing I'm good at
is faking it.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.486
I get that you need to think
that's true,

16:59.519 --> 17:00.987
but I have news for you.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.422
When you weren't looking,
Gretchen,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.591
you actually became good.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.760
Can you imagine
how unstoppable you would be

17:07.794 --> 17:09.062
if you actually tried?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.434
Bad mom, huh?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.922
You're lucky.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.558
Hello, florist.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.395
Please, enter so that
I may select centerpieces--

17:42.429 --> 17:45.632
a manly endeavor
if ever there was one.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.404
Hmm.

17:51.438 --> 17:55.108
Do you have anything
a bit more dangerous and badass?

17:55.142 --> 17:56.943
No. Pick one of these.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.712
You only just plunked them
annoyedly on the table

17:59.746 --> 18:01.248
a second ago.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.216
Well, daisies
are for schoolchildren.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.786
Succulents are
for anorexic Instagram girls.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.788
Is that just a bowl of sticks?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.791
Hmm. These are really quite
different, aren't they?

18:11.824 --> 18:14.461
One is white hydrangeas
and white calla lilies.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.129
The other
is all white hydrangeas.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.831
Well, the subtle difference
speaks volumes.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.300
Can you hurry?
I have somewhere to be.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.068
Okay, yep. Um...

18:22.101 --> 18:25.605
-well, hydrangeas
and calla lilies it is.
-Great.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.240
That's the deposit amount,

18:27.274 --> 18:29.442
and I need a sig there
and the check.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.344
Then I can get the hell
out of here.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.112
You really shouldn't talk
to your customers this way.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.947
You seriously want to argue
about my attitude,

18:34.981 --> 18:35.948
or do you want to tell
your fiancée

18:35.982 --> 18:37.250
that you got this done for her?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.985
Ha! Joke's on you.
My fiancée

18:39.018 --> 18:40.520
doesn't give a shit about this.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.788
Sorry.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.490
Most wedding people

18:43.523 --> 18:44.991
are total assholes.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.526
I get pre-defensive.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.861
Pre-defensive
is my natural state.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.430
What are you
so late for, anyway?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.131
Going to a show.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.933
What kind of show?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.470
* I'm gonna hunt you down *

18:57.504 --> 19:01.107
* And always get my way *

19:01.140 --> 19:05.312
* I'm gonna hunt you down *

19:05.345 --> 19:10.016
* I'm gonna make you pay *

19:10.049 --> 19:11.684
* So go ahead *

19:11.718 --> 19:14.221
* Go ahead and lock me up *

19:14.254 --> 19:17.724
* Lock me up *

19:20.560 --> 19:23.296
* I want to take your keys *

19:23.330 --> 19:27.234
* And now I'm gonna
drive your car *

19:27.267 --> 19:30.903
* I'm gonna take this
way too far. *

19:52.124 --> 19:53.192
-So...

19:54.261 --> 19:55.695
-You said something.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.163
Oh, I-I-I didn't say anything.
You did.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.233
:
Oh. Okay. Never mind.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.202
This food is taking forever.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.204
Isn't it taking forever?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.240
Uh, we haven't ordered yet.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.042
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:10.076 --> 20:11.511
I mean...

20:11.544 --> 20:13.580
funny, I thought we had.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.451
How's the gym?

20:18.485 --> 20:20.953
I haven't worked there
for over a year.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.855
Really

20:22.889 --> 20:25.392
Oh. Huh.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.594
I'm just...

20:27.627 --> 20:31.598
-I'm gonna hit the men's room.
-Okay, cool. Cool.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.232
We're so good
with our clothes off.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.335
-I don't know.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.507
Hey.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.943
You deserve
to find love, Lindsay.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.579
If I don't find someone soon,
I'm gonna end up alone.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.415
Like, "Mr. Rogers
begging children

21:22.449 --> 21:24.016
to be his neighbor" alone.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.818
I guess having Jimmy
and Gretchen

21:25.852 --> 21:28.254
about to tie the knot
is freaking me out.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.490
You know, maybe us hooking up

21:30.523 --> 21:33.192
has held you back
from finding it.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.365
As much as I'd hate
to give up quality D,

21:38.398 --> 21:41.334
I need to create space
for love in my heart.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.470
And my puss.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.904
And I want that for you.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.820
Great sex, bud.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.255
Real horny.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.738
Crap, that was mine.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.546
So, let's talk Nock Nock.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.916
-We're flying him in
for a signing meeting next week.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.585
-Wait, but everyone hated him.
-But you liked him.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.354
I couldn't stop watching him.
That doesn't mean I liked him.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.490
In a moment of panic, you
pulled him out of your brain.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.727
I'll go with instinct every time
in this business.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.029
I am definitely
gonna screw this up.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.331
Well, don't tell me that.
Jesus.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.699
We had our little
heart-to-heart.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.701
We experienced
some growth, right?

22:48.735 --> 22:50.236
I'm invested in you now.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.371
Nock Nock is all you, baby girl.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.941
Don't fuck this up.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.443
I won't.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.060
That was crazy.
How the hell

23:14.093 --> 23:15.928
did you survive that body slam?

23:15.962 --> 23:18.230
I feel... incredible!

23:18.264 --> 23:20.366
The rage.
The electricity.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.970
The devotion
of your entire physical being

23:24.003 --> 23:26.205
to the communal goal
of feeding

23:26.238 --> 23:30.109
an endless vortex
of violence is...

23:30.142 --> 23:33.045
the most asinine thing

23:33.079 --> 23:35.548
that I have ever done
in my life.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.217
To think that I wasted
even a millisecond

23:38.250 --> 23:40.653
worrying about
whether I'm a quote-unquote

23:40.687 --> 23:43.456
"bad boy" when being bad

23:43.490 --> 23:45.257
is so cheap.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.994
It's an empty goal
for the stupid

23:48.027 --> 23:50.897
that achieves
nothing substantive.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.000
Whereas my predictability

23:54.033 --> 23:56.503
has afforded me
a life that I love,

23:56.536 --> 24:00.072
an incredible fiancée
who's the reason

24:00.106 --> 24:02.509
that I'm having this epiphany
in the first place.

24:02.542 --> 24:06.345
I mean, maybe the true mark
of a bad boy

24:06.378 --> 24:09.415
is knowing that
you can be bad

24:09.448 --> 24:11.183
but having the strength

24:11.217 --> 24:14.220
to not have to prove it
all the time...

24:23.963 --> 24:26.032
* I do what I want *

24:26.065 --> 24:27.700
* I say what I want *

24:27.734 --> 24:30.537
* I wear what I want *

24:30.570 --> 24:32.204
* I'm walking away *

24:32.238 --> 24:33.940
* You know I don't mind *

24:33.973 --> 24:35.608
* I chill by myself *

24:35.642 --> 24:38.978
* You know I'm flyin' high *

24:39.011 --> 24:41.981
* I'm way up in the sky *

24:42.014 --> 24:46.052
* Don't even have to try *

24:46.085 --> 24:49.956
* 'Cause I can see everything. *

24:56.028 --> 24:57.997
