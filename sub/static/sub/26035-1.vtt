WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:04.838
CINDY: What an awesome night
it's been, huh?

00:04.872 --> 00:07.708
-Yeah.
-CHARLIE:
Good night, what a night.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.678
You know, you know, when I first
started working at Paddy's,

00:10.711 --> 00:14.182
this place was way more likely
to host a dog fight

00:14.215 --> 00:16.417
-than an event like tonight.
-(laughter)

00:16.450 --> 00:19.753
In fact, when I first walked in,
there were two dogs fighting.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.155
-Sure.
-They were, like,
strays or something

00:21.189 --> 00:23.224
that had wandered in?
No one noticed.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.559
-I don't know.
-Anyway, the point is,

00:25.593 --> 00:26.894
that this place has changed.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.063
You know? It's really evolved.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.865
And it's been so welcoming
of this brown-skinned girl

00:31.899 --> 00:33.667
and her liberal ideals.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.103
They're like family now.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.737
Which is saying a lot,

00:36.770 --> 00:39.440
since the first time I met
Frank, he pulled a gun on me.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.008
Misunderstanding. Not racial.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.612
Thanks, Frank. Anyway, the point
is, Paddy's is now a place

00:44.645 --> 00:47.281
where progressive-minded people
like us can feel at home.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.683
And I think that is worth
a round of applause.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.884
-FRANK: Yeah.
-(applause)

00:53.254 --> 00:55.089
Oh.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.558
You think those
liberal morons bought it?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.960
-Oh, yeah!
-They bought every word
you said.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.695
Oh, we've never been
this successful.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.397
This wine is selling like crazy.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.299
And look, it's called
"Conservative Whine,"

01:05.333 --> 01:06.634
but it's spelled with an "H,"

01:06.667 --> 01:08.102
'cause it's like
"We're whining."

01:08.136 --> 01:10.271
It's a pun.
It's a play on the word "wine."

01:10.304 --> 01:11.905
Yeah. Yeah, Mac, I get it.
I came up with it.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.974
-Yeah. yeah.
-CHARLIE: Yeah, so smart.
Shut up, Mac.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.376
-So smart.
-I get it, I get it.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.445
We're squeezing those
liberal boners for all they got,

01:17.478 --> 01:19.113
and we're just gonna keep on
squeezing them.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.149
-Yeah.
-Uh, no, we're not.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.616
-No, we're not.
-CINDY:
Dee, try to keep up, man.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.951
-Okay?
-I'm sorry.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.586
-Got to keep up.
-CINDY: Look.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.321
These liberals are easy.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.890
It's the conservative crowd
we're going after.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.625
-How?
-Nice. How? Whatcha thinking?

01:31.659 --> 01:34.995
Oh, uh, a little thing like...

01:35.028 --> 01:38.432
we're gonna make Paddy's
great again.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.435
*

02:03.191 --> 02:05.025
-(knocking)
-All right.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.864
-Hello, guys! Welcome!
-CHARLIE: Hello.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.533
Thank you for letting me host

02:12.566 --> 02:14.168
-the planning evening.
-Uh-huh. What'd you make?

02:14.202 --> 02:17.104
Yes, I made Mac's
Famous Mac and Cheese

02:17.137 --> 02:19.006
and some energy drinks
for everybody.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.474
It's all he ever makes
and it's un-edible.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.542
CINDY:
Okay, whatever.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.211
Let's get to the plan.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.012
Uh, ooh, ooh.
Sorry, um, for interrupting.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.848
I just wanted to do the
unveiling first, if that's cool.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.450
-The unveiling of what?
-Okay, everybody,

02:29.483 --> 02:32.052
are you ready?

02:32.085 --> 02:34.288
Bam.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.390
-All right, what's up?
-What's going on?

02:36.424 --> 02:38.359
Oh, well, I-I got
into really good shape.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.461
Am I hitting the light right?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.162
Wh-What... what's happening?

02:42.196 --> 02:43.531
-Why?
-Why?
-Hmm.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.166
I don't know,
I thought maybe we could use it.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.335
Use it for what?

02:47.368 --> 02:48.569
For the bar.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.070
-How?
-How?

02:50.103 --> 02:53.207
Well, Cindy, do you think maybe
we could fit this into the plan?

02:53.241 --> 02:54.642
I don't think so. I r...

02:54.675 --> 02:56.510
I don't really know
what's going on here, though.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.380
-Me, neither.
-Yeah, no one ever really knows
what's going on with Mac.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.082
-He's fat, he's skinny,
he's muscular, it's...
-It's best to ignore it.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.718
It's really a cry
for help and attention,

03:04.752 --> 03:05.986
-I think, so...
-Yeah.
-Mm.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.888
...what you do in that situation
is you ignore those.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.857
Yeah, treat it like a baby.
Treat it like a toddler.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.393
-We're not gonna...
put it into the plan?
-That make sense?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.595
-Yeah. Okay.
-Why did I... why did I do it?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.830
-Nobody knows.
-We don't know.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.666
-So, I have a great plan.
-Should I put my shirt on?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.033
-But...
-I think that's best.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.069
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, congrats,
Mac, it looks really good.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.904
-DEE: Good job.
-Can we figure out a way

03:23.937 --> 03:25.273
-to incorporate later?
-Let's just move past it now,

03:25.306 --> 03:27.275
-'cause it's dinnertime.
-Yeah?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.742
You guys like me, right?

03:28.776 --> 03:30.744
(Dee groaning)

03:30.778 --> 03:33.213
-FRANK: So...
-Okay,

03:33.247 --> 03:36.517
I have a plan how we are
gonna shut down Murphy's Pub.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.552
(gasps):
What's that?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.888
-What's Murphy's Pub?
What is that?
-Wait, what is that?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.524
Murphy's Pub? It's around
the corner from you guys.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.925
-Oh, the bar, the bar.
-DEE: Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.093
The super successful bar
around the corner.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.895
-They do well.
-Why would we shut that down?

03:47.928 --> 03:49.297
Because they do,
like, five times

03:49.330 --> 03:51.465
-the business that we do.
-CHARLIE: They do?

03:51.499 --> 03:54.435
Yeah, so we're gonna poach
their customers, shut them down,

03:54.468 --> 03:57.271
thereby making Paddy's
great again.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.872
-Whoa! That is so smart.
-DEE: That is smart.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.308
Why have we never thought
about doing that?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.075
DEE: I don't know, we're
gonna steal their customers.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.612
Ah, this is the waitress.
Do you guys mind if I get this?

04:04.645 --> 04:05.913
DEE: Yeah, we're
right in the middle...

04:05.946 --> 04:06.914
CHARLIE:
Hey, honey.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.048
Sorry, I'm in a meeting.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.049
Are you just...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.284
You're just checking in?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.119
I don't know.
Is the TV just not working?

04:12.152 --> 04:13.587
-(Mac groans)
-All right.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.123
Can I call you later
or something, 'cause I'm just...

04:16.156 --> 04:17.791
We're super bu...
we're in the thing.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.092
Yeah, I'll check in later.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.461
-Sorry, she was
just checking in.
-Oh, cool.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.330
-(doorbell buzzing)
-Yeah. All right, so what's up?

04:22.363 --> 04:25.098
-So, how are we gonna do this?
-I'm gonna take you
through the plan.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.900
There's a lot of moving pieces,
and you each play

04:26.934 --> 04:28.268
-a crucial part.
-It's here! It's here!

04:28.302 --> 04:29.570
Cindy, I am so sorry
for interrupting,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.104
but it has finally arrived,

04:31.138 --> 04:33.774
and I think you
are going to be very impressed

04:33.807 --> 04:36.109
with what is inside this crate.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.111
-Another rocket launcher.
-No, Frank.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.648
Much cooler than that.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.784
-(Dee gasps)
-CHARLIE: Oh!
-Oh, my God!

04:43.817 --> 04:45.819
What am I looking at here, Mac?

04:45.853 --> 04:48.589
-What? What do you mean?
-FRANK: Oh...

04:48.622 --> 04:51.191
-Is that a sex doll?
-Yeah.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.994
-Is that Dennis?
-Well, yeah, of course.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.830
-Is that part of the plan?
-No!

04:56.864 --> 04:59.833
Why did you get a sex doll
of your old roommate?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.535
Because you told me to get one.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.371
-I definitely did not.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.340
I was, I was super sad
about my old roommate leaving,

05:06.374 --> 05:10.210
and you said I needed something
Dennis-shaped to fill my hole.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.780
No, Mac, I said
that you obviously had

05:12.813 --> 05:16.016
a Dennis-shaped hole in your
life that you needed to fill.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.318
How is that not the same thing?

05:18.352 --> 05:21.021
Okay, I obviously wanted you to,
I don't know, maybe start dating

05:21.054 --> 05:24.458
or do something, not get
a sex doll of your best friend.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.560
-No, not best friend.
-CHARLIE: Oh, whoa, whoa.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.696
-Yeah, sorry, not best friend.
-DEE: He didn't like him much.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.698
He left him a contact number
for where he was gonna be

05:30.731 --> 05:33.033
in North Dakota, but it ended up
being a mental health line.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.402
-CHARLIE (chuckles): Yeah.
-MAC: He miswrote

05:34.435 --> 05:37.638
-one of the digits, and that...
-Nah, he knew what he was doing.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.540
-FRANK: He was avoiding him.
-No, it was not a mistake.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.709
All right, well, look, guys,
either way, it's not weird.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.811
It's not like
I'm gonna have sex with it.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.145
He's gonna have sex with that

05:45.178 --> 05:46.980
the second
we walk out of this door.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.749
No. It might just be cool
to have around

05:48.782 --> 05:50.050
for, like, companionship,
you know?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.985
-Nah, he wants to bang it.
-I'm not gonna bang it.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.388
-This is the waitress again.
Should I get it?
-Oh, my God, come on.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.256
Okay, you know what,
you know what, this is just...

05:56.289 --> 05:57.758
this is not gonna work here,
all right?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.092
-(phone continues ringing)
-Let's just go.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.528
Please get rid of the doll.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.329
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll get rid of the doll.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.997
It was a misunderstanding,
you know?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.599
Like, I'm not
gonna have sex with it.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.835
He is. The second we leave,
he's gonna bang it.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.570
*

06:09.603 --> 06:12.072
CINDY:
Okay, guys, I am going to use

06:12.105 --> 06:14.442
social media to spread fake news

06:14.475 --> 06:16.577
that Murphy's hired
an alt-right figurehead

06:16.610 --> 06:18.011
to speak at their pub.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.548
The liberals are gonna protest,
while the conservatives are

06:20.581 --> 06:22.750
gonna march for the speaker's
First Amendment rights,

06:22.783 --> 06:24.618
and that is
where Frank comes in.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.857
A tuba?
What am I gonna do with a tuba?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.460
You're gonna play it
to enflame the crowd.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.928
Dee, we're gonna need to
distract Murphy's security guard

06:34.962 --> 06:36.430
-with a pretty blonde.
-Okay.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.931
You want me to go find one?

06:37.965 --> 06:39.767
No. I'm talking about you.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.735
Oh, you want me to flirt?
Oh, wow.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.771
Normally I'm on lookout
while Dennis flirts.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.039
But okay, I'm in.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.208
-Great. Next part of the plan.
Now, listen up...
-MAC: Oh, hey, guys.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.645
So, so sorry.
Cindy, I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.114
-Got held up, but I am ready.
-CINDY: What is this?

06:54.147 --> 06:57.117
Why did you bring that thing?
I told you to get rid of it!

06:57.150 --> 07:00.220
Oh, I tried, but apparently,
I cannot return the doll

07:00.253 --> 07:03.457
due to the custom nature
of the usage of the doll.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.059
-Banging its mouth.
-Right.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.962
I guess some people do.
I don't know, but I don't know.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.131
Either way,
what do you guys think?

07:12.299 --> 07:15.135
-About what?
-I'm shirtless in the duster.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.637
Oh, yeah. Why?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.839
-Well, I thought
that could work.
-Toward what?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.140
I don't know.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.476
This is Cindy's plan.
Cindy, how does this work?

07:22.510 --> 07:25.112
It doesn't. Stop trying
to shoehorn your shirtless-ness

07:25.145 --> 07:26.980
into plans that
have no need for it.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.016
Well, I feel like this is
what Dennis would've done.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.818
Yeah, but Dennis
had a reason for it, man!

07:30.851 --> 07:32.686
And you're not Dennis! You're
never gonna be, all right?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.254
-So just drop it.
-This, by the way,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.089
-is desperate and sad.
-It's just sad, dude.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.991
It was his idea anyway, so...

07:38.025 --> 07:41.361
I'm sorry, the sex doll
gave you an idea?

07:41.394 --> 07:44.331
Well, not exactly,
but you know, it was, like,

07:44.364 --> 07:45.766
when I was sitting there
with him,

07:45.799 --> 07:48.702
I was sort of picturing
what Dennis would say.

07:48.736 --> 07:52.540
-Oh. (laughing)
-And that's...

07:52.573 --> 07:54.642
-Nice one, man.
-What?

07:54.675 --> 07:55.876
Oh, something
the doll just said.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.310
The doll talks to you now?

07:57.344 --> 07:59.547
No, the doll's not talking
to me, but like he said,

07:59.580 --> 08:02.015
I was picturing what Dennis
might've said in the situation

08:02.049 --> 08:03.350
and Dennis just said something
really funny.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.653
-What was it?
-Well, it was about you, Dee.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.721
-(laughing): I just heard it.
-Do you picture it?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.557
-I heard it. Oh, yeah.
-(laughing)

08:09.590 --> 08:11.859
-I heard it.
-It's... (laughing)

08:11.892 --> 08:13.193
What the hell are you guys
talking about?

08:13.226 --> 08:14.962
-It called me a bird.
-Yes! It did.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.029
-Exactly.
-So you did hear it.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.030
-We all heard it.
-Bird.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.365
How is that funny?

08:18.398 --> 08:19.533
It's-it's really not.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.401
It's just the way Dennis
would have said it.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.137
You can just sort of picture it
coming out of his mouth.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.207
Okay, okay, cool, but, guys, can
we just get back to the plan?

08:27.240 --> 08:28.709
-Yes.
-Mac's shirtless plan, or...?

08:28.742 --> 08:29.877
Mac's shirtless plan.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.411
No, he did not have a plan.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.582
Our plan. My plan.
To shut down Murphy's.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.684
Dee, you're gonna flirt
with the security guard.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.918
Frank, tuba. Mac, Charlie,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.588
I need you to change labels
on wine bottles.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.922
Okay? Any questions?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.490
Yes?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.559
The blowjob mouth,
did it come standard on the doll

08:45.593 --> 08:47.160
or did you customize that?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.029
It's not a blowjob mouth, Dee.
Don't be crass.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.898
I requested that the doll
feel as though

08:50.931 --> 08:53.000
-it's in mid-conversation.
-Oh.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.603
-Okay. Any other questions?
-Yup.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.571
Not about the sex doll.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.077
"Liberal Tears." It's so funny

09:04.111 --> 09:06.046
because the liberals
are always whining about stuff

09:06.079 --> 09:07.247
and the conservatives
drink it up.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.416
-They're drinking their tears.
-Uh, yeah, yeah.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.951
No, Cindy's brilliant, man.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.286
And using all the glitter
and stuff was a great idea, too,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.589
-you know what I mean?
-Yeah, I had a good idea
about the glitter.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.024
I was thinking maybe
you would slather it

09:17.057 --> 09:19.359
-all over my naked torso
and we would use that.
-Uh-huh.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.361
Why?

09:21.394 --> 09:24.598
Oh, well, that can just be
a part of the plan, you know?

09:24.632 --> 09:26.199
It doesn't have anything
to do with anything, though.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.367
Well, then why did I do
all this working out, Charlie?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.736
Nobody knows, man.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.938
-All right, guys.
What do you think?
-Whoa!

09:30.971 --> 09:33.106
-Wow, Dee, you look great!
-Really?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.441
Yeah, I hate to admit it,

09:34.474 --> 09:35.943
but this look's kind of
working for you.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.978
Yeah, you might actually be able
to distract that security guard.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.046
Nice.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.648
(tuba playing)

09:40.681 --> 09:41.815
Whoa!

09:41.849 --> 09:45.385
-Frank, you got it, man!
-Holy shit! Uh, look.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.121
Dee looks good,
Frank's killing it on the tuba,

09:48.155 --> 09:50.223
we might actually be able
to pull this thing off.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.059
I think we're gonna do it.
I think...

09:52.092 --> 09:55.395
What happened?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.664
I can't do it.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.632
-Wh-Why?
-What went wrong?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.668
He's staring right at me.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.903
(ominous music plays)

10:02.936 --> 10:04.071
MAC:
So what?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.973
Look, I know it's just
a lifeless thing

10:06.006 --> 10:09.009
that Mac pumps his loads into,
but it's in my head.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.845
Again, guys, I am not having sex
with the doll.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.847
-You unload in that doll.
-You're having sex
with the doll.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.949
-DEE: You unload into that doll.
-I can smell it. Yeah.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.517
No, th-that's bleach.
I cleaned him.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.619
-Well, then why
did you clean it?
-Why did you clean it?

10:19.653 --> 10:23.090
It doesn't matter why I cleaned
it. I-I'm a sanitary person.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.426
Look, I got to be honest.
It's in my head, too.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.595
-How?
-It doesn't like
what I'm wearing

10:28.628 --> 10:30.030
and it thinks
I need more makeup.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.033
(ominous music plays)

10:33.066 --> 10:35.002
-(gasps) Oh...
-Oh, my God.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.536
I can totally see that.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.672
Yeah, I can picture Dennis
saying that to you right now.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.540
Yeah, it also thinks
Mac looks fat.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.844
-That's... that's a lie!
-I know, I know, but it...

10:43.877 --> 10:46.346
-that's just what he thinks.
-Let me ask it.
Dennis, does Mac look fat?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.716
(ominous music plays)

10:48.749 --> 10:50.350
-What... No!
-Oh, yeah.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.686
Dennis, Dennis, I am not fat.
Look, I'm ripped.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.355
I don't know why he did it
either, man. He just did it.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.556
Well, there...
It's a long story.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.125
He's not impressed.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.459
What, you don't like the labels?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.895
It doesn't like the labels
on the... these are dumb

11:01.929 --> 11:03.530
"Liberal Tears," right.
Does it say "tear"

11:03.563 --> 11:05.165
or does it say "tear"?
It's confusing.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.900
Maybe I'll do a couple
of crunches, though.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.068
I'm gonna go put some more
lipstick on.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.302
I'm gonna, I'm gonna practice.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.038
-Yeah... Oh. Yeah. Oh.
-(phone ringing)

11:11.071 --> 11:13.073
Now I'm getting a call again.
It's her again.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.674
Hey, honey.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.845
Yeah, I'm just, I'm working...
still working with the ga...

11:17.878 --> 11:19.980
Yeah. Uh, they're all...
You want to say hi or something?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.882
Tell her not to worry
'cause I'm doing crunches.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.384
Oh, yeah, no, he's doing
crunches for Dennis.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.919
(scoffs)
No, he's not back.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.188
It's... What do you care
if Dennis is back?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.557
Look... Can I...

11:30.590 --> 11:33.460
Can we just catch up later
when I get home from...

11:34.527 --> 11:37.097
(ominous music plays)

11:37.130 --> 11:40.567
Hang on.
I just got an idea.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.570
So it's called "Liberal Tears."

11:43.603 --> 11:45.572
I don't know if it's confusing,
that's not really the point.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.340
What I want to know is
what do you think of this?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.442
I think it's super weird.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.280
Like in a good way or like...?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.382
Like in the creepiest
possible way, Charlie.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.751
I mean, it's like Dennis is
sitting in our apartment

11:57.785 --> 11:59.519
-just staring at us.
-(Charlie laughs)

11:59.552 --> 12:02.255
I know, but, like, look, you
need someone to talk to, right?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.191
And I-I just, I can't be
that guy right now.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.759
I'm so busy being a success
and stuff.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.027
It's just, like, so much work.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.296
I'm sorry. You want me
to talk to the doll?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.964
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
And-and it's weird,

12:10.998 --> 12:13.533
'cause it's-it's kind of like
he talks back to you.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.036
It's crazy. He's already shamed
Mac, which was pretty funny.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.637
All right, I got to run.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.306
W-W-Wait. You're leaving?
Can I come?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.741
Well, no, sweetie. It's...
I-I got to go work at the bar.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.777
A-And that's gonna be a trigger
for you with all the drinking...

12:23.811 --> 12:25.378
-I feel like like you're always
going to the bar...
-Sweetie.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.980
-...and always running out.
-Oh, sweetie, the feelings.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.950
N-N-No. The doll.
That's what the doll is for.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.284
You talk to the doll,

12:31.318 --> 12:34.121
-and-and not me so much.
-Charlie.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.458
(tuba playing)

12:38.491 --> 12:42.062
-(squawks)
-Mm, sorry. I feel foolish.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.164
You had this, Frank;
I heard you earlier.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.733
I know, but I'm all
in my head about it.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.803
Okay, now that makes
one, two, three.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.972
-Three bottles of wine.
-CINDY: Three?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.941
You guys have only done
three bottles?

12:53.974 --> 12:55.475
Yeah. I'm sorry, Cindy.
We just got a little distracted.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.810
-Yeah.
-Wait. And what happened

12:56.844 --> 12:58.946
to the labels;
those just say "wine."

12:58.979 --> 13:00.914
We thought "Liberal Tears"
was maybe gonna be confusing,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.851
-you know?
-Yeah, like, what if people read
it like "tears"?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.986
You know, like,
what are these liberals tearing?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.687
-And why are they tearing it?
-Yeah.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.822
And, Dee, what is this?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.991
Oh, it's just a-a new
lighting setup.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.326
It-it washes me out.
It's-it's a better look.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.162
Guys, what is happening here?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.463
Everything was going
so smoothly.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.965
Yeah, it's nothing. It's fine.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.667
No, it's nothing. W-We're doing
good still, we're good.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.335
-Whatever. We got this.
-Don't worry about us.
-Don't know.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.837
Wait a second.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.606
This doesn't have anything
to do with the doll, does it?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.541
-Come on. Why would the doll...?
-No.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.211
-The doll? What do we care
about the doll?
-The doll... (mutters)

13:31.244 --> 13:32.679
CINDY:
No?

13:32.712 --> 13:36.349
-Okay, well, where is the doll?
-It's at my apartment.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.785
Why isn't it in the trash?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.021
It's-it's just doing me
a quick favor.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.489
-Get rid of it.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

13:42.522 --> 13:46.026
I don't care. Trash. Burn.
River. Just get rid of it.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
It was a bad... bad idea.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.129
-Yeah, get rid of it, dude.
-It's going in the trash.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.697
-Yeah, get rid of it, man.
-Yeah. Got to go. Got to go.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.764
See, I told him. I told him.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.468
It's just a doll, you know?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.037
It's-it's fun to have around.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.538
It's kind of cool.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.007
Hey, it's me.
It looks like Cindy wants me

14:00.040 --> 14:01.541
to get rid of the...

14:01.574 --> 14:02.976
What the hell is this?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.245
Oh, I fucked him.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.147
* Bring me a higher love *

14:07.180 --> 14:09.649
Well, yeah,
I can see that. Why?!

14:09.682 --> 14:13.220
Um, because that's what
it was designed for?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.922
You were... you were supposed
to talk to it,

14:14.955 --> 14:18.158
-not have sex with it!
-Okay, well, I did talk to it.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.493
And it told me to drink
this bottle of wine.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.563
And then it talked me
into having sex with it.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.864
I can't... You know,
this is cheating, by the way.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.067
-You're cheating on me.
-Uh, with a doll.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.938
-With Dennis!
-Okay, you sh... (laughs)

14:30.971 --> 14:33.006
His voice is funny.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.208
-Oh, oh, oh! Go to hell!
-I hadn't noticed it.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.344
-Go... You go right to hell!
-It's-it's so high. (laughs)

14:37.377 --> 14:38.845
-Okay. All right. I know.
-Stupid... (mutters)

14:38.878 --> 14:40.613
No, shh, shh, shh.
Everybody, this is...

14:40.647 --> 14:45.218
-Yeah, shut up, man!
-This is awkward. I got it.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.787
Charlie,
I'm breaking up with you.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.092
You're-you're breaking up
with me?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.927
-I think you should leave.
-I'm gonna break up with you!

14:53.961 --> 14:56.529
I already said it.
We think you should get out.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.531
-I can't believe this.
I'm out of here.
-Wa-Wa-Wait!

14:58.565 --> 14:59.799
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.436
Do you have any more bottles
of wine?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.939
*

15:05.973 --> 15:08.475
-* Bring me a higher love. *
-(shouting)
-(grunting)

15:11.911 --> 15:15.415
-*
-MAN: Shake it, shake it!
-(shouting, whooping)

15:15.448 --> 15:17.951
I'm sorry, Charlie. This sucks.

15:17.985 --> 15:21.221
I mean, I think maybe some fresh
titty will cheer you up, huh?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.589
-Mm.
-Yeah.
-Charlie, the waitress

15:22.622 --> 15:24.391
is an asshole.
You're just way better off

15:24.424 --> 15:26.393
-without her.
-Yeah. No, you're right.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.461
I'm-I'm just pissed
that Dennis did that to me.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.762
-Mm.
-Of course.
-You know what I mean?

15:29.796 --> 15:31.498
-Dennis is a bastard, man.
Right?
-Yeah.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.067
-Always has been,
always has been.
-I mean, dude, look around.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.302
You're in the strip club, man.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.070
-Okay!
-We always go to the strip club

15:37.104 --> 15:38.505
-to make ourselves feel better.
-That's right.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.173
-This is fun. Right?
-Yeah, okay. Yes.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.975
Yes.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.776
I feel like I'm forcing it
a little.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.278
-It feels forced, right?
-Yeah.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.579
-Why is that?
-Why are we here?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.615
Yeah, I mean, look, guys,
I think the problem is

15:48.648 --> 15:50.583
that we're trying to do things
that we used to do.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.252
But-but things
are different now.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.754
Look, Dennis is gone,
and he is not coming back.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.423
We have to accept that.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.925
Yeah, why are we letting Dennis
keep messing up our lives?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.293
-He's not even here, man.
-Yeah. Absolutely. Right.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.495
Like, it's time to move on
from that guy.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.831
And if I'm being perfectly
honest, I like Cindy better.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.933
Oh, yeah.
She's smart, she's funny.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.302
-Yes.
-She's an asshole,
but in all the right ways.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.638
-She's just the right amount
of asshole, you know?
-Yeah, exactly.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.274
She's kind of like Dennis
but only way better.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.275
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-Better than Dennis.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.277
I absolutely prefer her
to Dennis.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.212
-DEE: Right?
-I like her more.
-So, look, maybe we just got

16:19.246 --> 16:20.780
to put Dennis behind us,

16:20.813 --> 16:22.482
-finally, once and for all...
-Mm.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.784
...and move forward, with Cindy,

16:24.817 --> 16:27.954
and be a new gang.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.123
-To the new gang.
-There you go.
-The new Cindy gang.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.692
-Yeah, right! New gang!
-New gang, new gang.
-New gang with Cindy.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.361
Cindy.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.030
All right,
what do we do with him?

16:37.064 --> 16:38.565
Not sure yet.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.234
But, uh, what do you say we do,
like, three rounds of shots

16:41.268 --> 16:42.569
-and figure it out after that?
-DEE: Hey!

16:42.602 --> 16:44.003
-Hey!
-(laughs)

16:46.406 --> 16:48.007
(door opens)

16:48.041 --> 16:49.709
Hey-o! So sorry we're late.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.345
Guys, what the hell?
The Murphy's protest

16:52.379 --> 16:53.846
is about to start.
Where is everyone?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.648
Cindy, we just wanted to let you
know that you were right

16:55.682 --> 16:58.051
-about everything,
and we think you are amazing.
-Yes, yes.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.319
Now, we were at the strip club

16:59.352 --> 17:01.654
last night,
and we came up with a way

17:01.688 --> 17:04.157
to deal with our Dennis issues
and do your plan

17:04.191 --> 17:06.326
-and finally move forward.
-Yeah.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.496
Guys? Let's do it!

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
(playing musical notes)

17:16.703 --> 17:18.571
Oh, God.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.040
-(plays high note)
-CINDY: Oh, yuck!

17:21.074 --> 17:22.675
No, stop! Stop it!

17:22.709 --> 17:24.244
Stop! Charlie, stop!

17:24.277 --> 17:26.679
How is this moving things
forward? What are you doing?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.415
Oh, I was playing his asshole.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.250
That part I got. Why?

17:30.283 --> 17:31.918
Well, well,
after a series of events

17:31.951 --> 17:34.554
-that I'd rather not go into...
-Not necessary.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.189
I came to the realization
that the only way

17:36.223 --> 17:39.192
to not be humiliated by Dennis
while playing the tuba

17:39.226 --> 17:40.560
-was to play him.
-CHARLIE: But then,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.229
out front,
he got a little nervous

17:42.262 --> 17:44.030
-about doing that. Yeah.
He got a little gun-shy.
-I couldn't do it.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.532
-So I volunteered.
-Yeah.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.400
Well, you see, we're still
making Paddy's great again,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.569
-but now everybody's happy.
-That's right, that's right.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.371
So, what do you think?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.872
You want to know what I think?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.074
-Yeah.
-Um, here's what I think.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.610
I think that you all went
to a strip club last night

17:57.644 --> 17:59.479
and you got super hammered
and horny

17:59.512 --> 18:01.981
and the three of you decided
to fuck the doll,

18:02.014 --> 18:04.784
only to find out that when force
is applied to the almost

18:04.817 --> 18:06.953
vacuum-tight polyurethane hole,

18:06.986 --> 18:08.955
it made a noise.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.558
You instantly put it
in your mouth.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.293
You probably knew it'd work,
because

18:13.326 --> 18:15.895
you clearly have had sex
with the doll multiple times.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.597
You decided that this was
the most brilliant idea

18:17.630 --> 18:20.267
that you've ever come up with,
when, really, it was the result

18:20.300 --> 18:24.137
of the most insane, disgusting
orgy that has ever taken place.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.973
And you, Dee, you just sat back
and watched the whole thing

18:27.006 --> 18:28.975
happen because you are so numb
to this kind of behavior

18:29.008 --> 18:32.312
that it doesn't even register
to you as odd.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.482
-That's dead-on.
-Wow.
-Yeah, you nailed it.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.350
-You nailed it. I mean, like...
-Boy, that...
-Wow. Yeah.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.152
-Point by point.
-You ran home with that one.
-Wow.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.354
Guys, come on.
You are better than this.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.823
I know you can be better
than this. And I can help you.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.925
But you got to
make a choice, okay?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.261
You can either
leave Dennis behind

18:48.295 --> 18:50.497
or you can stay the same.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.831
Keep doing what you're doing--

18:51.864 --> 18:53.500
playing a doll's asshole
with your mouth

18:53.533 --> 18:56.169
and talking to something that's
never gonna talk back to you.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.437
DENNIS:
Or will it?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.639
-(screaming, shouting)
-FRANK: Oh, shit!

18:59.672 --> 19:01.007
-Kill it!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Whoa!

19:01.040 --> 19:03.009
(shouting)

19:03.042 --> 19:05.945
Oh. Hey, hey. Take it easy, man.
I'm not a doll.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.181
I threw that thing on the floor.
By the way, what is that thing?

19:08.215 --> 19:09.782
I don't like it.
Why do you have it?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.618
-It's for Mac.
-Uh... Yeah.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.353
Oh, Mac's shooting his loads
into it?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.454
-Definitely his.
He definitely is.
-No, no.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.988
DENNIS:
Yeah. All right, well, anyway,

19:16.022 --> 19:17.324
I'm back. The real me.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.958
Let's not-not make
a whole thing of it.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.126
You.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.962
Uh, I gather you were
meant to replace me?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.298
Well, that's not necessary
anymore, so, um,

19:25.332 --> 19:26.966
you can go now.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.801
Excuse me?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.637
I think you can go.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.639
You dress like it's 1998.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.141
Your look is played out
and so are you.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.644
-You're basic.
-Oh. I see.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.312
Well, why don't we, uh...

19:39.346 --> 19:41.481
-why don't we ask them?
-Yeah, sure.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.150
-Oh...
-Well, he did just get here,

19:44.183 --> 19:46.386
-so let's not go crazy, right?
-Kind of like seeing him.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.888
Charlie, you were just playing
his asshole to humiliate him.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.557
-DENNIS: Ah.
-I do lots of crazy things,
you know?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.158
-I never really know what I'm...
-Yeah.
-That's in the past.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.394
-Yeah. I mean...
-And I like to live
in the present.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.329
Dee, you don't want this loser
back, do you?

19:56.363 --> 19:58.565
I mean...

19:58.598 --> 20:00.733
-What? Come on.
-Uh...

20:00.767 --> 20:02.269
They're just gonna go back
to treating you like shit

20:02.302 --> 20:03.603
the minute I leave.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.505
Come on, us ladies--
we got to stick together.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.073
Yeah, yeah,
I hear what you're saying,

20:07.106 --> 20:09.075
but I kind of like being
the only woman.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.510
'Cause it makes me feel special.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.679
This is insane.
You know what? Screw you guys.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.848
Enjoy your crappy lives and your
insane, miserable, failed ideas.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.217
You guys are played out.
You're basic.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.752
-Uh-oh.
-Ooh, yeah. You know what?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.421
-You already said that. Uh...
-Yeah.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.089
-(laughs)
-You did. She said that already.
-A second ago.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.591
DEE:
Did you run out of insults?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.559
-Recycling her material.
-Yeah. That's not good.
-(laughs)

20:26.593 --> 20:28.695
-She didn't have to have
a bad attitude about it.
-That's not good. Yeah. Hey,

20:28.728 --> 20:31.230
-I don't know about you guys,
but I'm a little bit thirsty.
-What a bitch.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.932
Do you guys still serve beer
here, or...?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.468
-Oh, yeah.
-(laughs) I knew you were gonna
say something funny, man.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.270
-So smart, too. Clever.
-Do we serve beer?
-Because we're a bar.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.772
-Clever. Yeah. Funny, man.
-Do we serve beer?
-We do.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.274
-Well, welcome back, man.
-(chuckles)

20:41.308 --> 20:44.544
-Well, for now.
I'm back for now.
-Oh? All right.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.745
Guys, you know what?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.614
I think we just made
Paddy's great again.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.616
-(laughs)
-Shut up, bird.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.084
-Oh! (laughing)
-Oh!

20:52.118 --> 20:53.386
So reliable.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.388
CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah,
you can just count on it.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.723
-Yeah.
-DEE: Yeah.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.791
Hey, Mac,
did you gain a little weight?

20:58.825 --> 21:01.828
* The boys are back in town,
the boys are back in town *

21:03.830 --> 21:07.800
* I said
the boys are back in town... *

21:07.834 --> 21:10.136
* The boys are back in town *

21:10.169 --> 21:13.306
* The boys are back in town,
the boys are back in town *

21:13.340 --> 21:14.807
* The boys are back in town *

21:14.841 --> 21:16.843
* The boys
are back in town *

21:28.855 --> 21:31.858
* You know that chick
that used to dance a lot... *

21:34.861 --> 21:37.864
(trio chanting backwards)

21:40.867 --> 21:42.869
