00:04.305 --> 00:05.539
( moans )

00:09.143 --> 00:10.478
( chuckles )

00:15.849 --> 00:18.086
Baby, you're freezing.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.287
( knocking on door )

00:25.826 --> 00:28.529
( pounding on door )
Hey. Hey.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.667
Whoa! Whoa!

00:42.243 --> 00:46.147
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:46.180 --> 00:49.383
and CBS

01:22.450 --> 01:24.218
I didn't think that
you would notice.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.187
Oh, stealing food is okay
if nobody notices?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.388
It's not stealing,
it was sharing.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.856
I didn't want to share
my lunch with you.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.158
See, you just said
it was sharing.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.293
Excuse me.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.195
Show a little respect.

01:34.228 --> 01:37.265
This is a place of peace
and dignity.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.400
That was before
Kate got here.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.469
We need a mediator, Ducky,

01:41.502 --> 01:43.537
or I'm going to have to go
to Employee Relations.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.838
Which would be tattling.

01:44.872 --> 01:45.839
No, going to Employee Relations
is not tattling.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.275
It's the adult version
of "I'm telling Mommy."

01:47.308 --> 01:48.176
You are so juvenile.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.377
Am not.
Are so.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.479
Am not.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.347
( sighs ):
Ducky...

01:53.381 --> 01:55.316
we need
an unofficial mediator.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.684
Did you try Gibbs?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.521
Yes, I see your point.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.255
We thought of McGee.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.656
But we have
no respect for him.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.791
And then we thought of you.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.528
I see, third on the short list.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.862
Well, at least
I beat out Abby.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.364
Well, we just came from there.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.632
She turned us down.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.800
Oh.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.835
Come on, Ducky,
she's driving me crazy.

02:14.868 --> 02:18.506
Well, I am busy, but...

02:18.539 --> 02:22.176
Abby needs these
blood samples stat.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.778
Yes, as I say, I am busy,

02:24.812 --> 02:26.514
but I'm flattered
that you would entrust

02:26.547 --> 02:28.182
your relationship to me.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.218
It will be rather like

02:30.251 --> 02:32.453
marriage counseling.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.721
Let's not use those words.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.890
Ducky, it is only
a "working relationship."

02:36.924 --> 02:38.459
TONY:
So you'll do it?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.628
Of course.
I would relish the experience.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.664
Yes, I studied psychology at
the University of Edinburgh

02:43.697 --> 02:45.866
under Professor
O'Donnell...
Okay, so let's start.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.235
I left my desk

02:47.268 --> 02:49.470
for just a minute
and when I came back,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.972
Tony was eating half
of my tuna fish sandwich.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.507
Okay. See... see...

02:53.541 --> 02:54.775
Whoo!

02:54.808 --> 02:56.344
I'm hungry--
we're buddies.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.445
It shouldn't be
a big deal.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.879
But little Miss Tighty
Twisty Pants

02:58.912 --> 03:00.748
blows everything
out of proportion

03:00.781 --> 03:01.782
and it becomes a major deal.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.518
All you left me was the crust.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.987
Ah, who is right here?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.923
Come on, Ducky, please.
Tell him.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.494
We need to look
a little deeper.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.562
I mean, there is clearly

03:14.595 --> 03:17.431
a latent sibling rivalry

03:17.465 --> 03:19.433
being expressed by
your adolescent

03:19.467 --> 03:21.969
and sexually-charged
bickering.

03:22.002 --> 03:26.474
It all stems from
a desperate desire to please

03:26.507 --> 03:27.741
a father figure.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.443
And I think we all know
who that is.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.512
What does this have to do
with my tuna fish sandwich?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.480
There's no father
figure, Ducky.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.948
Hey.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.617
Why don't you answer your phone?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.519
Norfolk Homicide
found a body,

03:38.552 --> 03:39.787
a female petty officer.
Come on.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.754
Let's go.
I'll gas the truck.

03:40.788 --> 03:41.955
I got the gear.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.357
I pre-packed the gear
already.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.759
Yes, there are clearly
issues here.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.461
Yes, we need to meet

03:47.495 --> 03:49.397
twice a week, at least.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.334
DETECTIVE MAUCERI:
Petty Officer Second Class
Manda King

03:53.367 --> 03:55.503
according to her ID.

03:55.536 --> 03:59.307
26 years of age,
in the navy four years.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.308
That's as far as I got

04:00.341 --> 04:01.275
when we called you.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.876
Hell, we got enough
things to do around here.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.747
( plastic cigarette whistles )
Give me a break,
I'm trying to quit.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.948
This the suspect?

04:07.981 --> 04:11.385
Willie Taylor.
Tends bar at Sugar Street.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.286
We're processing him now.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.287
Okay, Ducky.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.422
All right.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.590
Stabbed to death?

04:16.624 --> 04:20.628
Oh, I think that's
a safe assumption.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.330
Although,
I found something

04:22.363 --> 04:24.064
around her nares.
Show him, Jimmy.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.568
Do I have nares, Jimmy?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.602
All mammals
have nares, sir.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.737
Openings in your nose.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.672
Give that to Abby.
Have her ID it.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.740
Yes, sir.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.574
I didn't mean to imply
you didn't

04:33.607 --> 04:35.643
know what nares were.
Time of death?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.978
Well, the windows
are open,

04:38.011 --> 04:39.012
the body is naked,

04:39.046 --> 04:42.350
which would allow the heat
to dissipate faster.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.784
If I were forced
to proclaim a rough...

04:43.817 --> 04:45.419
I'm forcing.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.755
0330, 0500.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.958
We got an anonymous 911 call
of a woman screaming

04:50.991 --> 04:52.426
in this apartment at 5:30.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.827
Or 0530.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.895
GIBBS:
McGee.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.664
See if you can trace the source
of that 911 call.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.731
On it.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.534
Her lividity has changed.

05:00.568 --> 05:01.669
She may have been moved.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.437
Suspect said
he flipped her.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.805
Boss, I don't know
if you want to see this,

05:04.838 --> 05:06.073
but you probably should.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.709
Some night.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.877
Got to be
three condoms in there.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.412
Bag 'em.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.446
Get 'em to Abby.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.415
Spoke to Manda King's C.O.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.584
Bag 'em, Probie.
Said she was
a good sailor,

05:16.617 --> 05:18.652
straight-laced,
a real hard worker.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.988
And she was being promoted
to the captain's yeoman.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.090
Personal yeoman to a navy
captain doesn't track with

05:23.123 --> 05:24.124
snorting drugs.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.360
She told her shipmates
she had business in Norfolk.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.428
Didn't say what?

05:27.461 --> 05:28.496
No.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.697
Your place or mine?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.632
( cigarette whistles ):
Mine.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.603
Look...

05:35.636 --> 05:36.670
on my mother's life,

05:36.704 --> 05:40.040
that's not the girl
that I took home last night.

05:40.073 --> 05:44.378
You went to bed with one woman
and you woke up with another?

05:44.412 --> 05:45.546
Mm-hmm.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.747
I hate it
when that happens.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.716
Never as pretty.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.950
Sorry.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.620
Oh, come on, you're not
going to tell Ducky

05:52.653 --> 05:55.656
about that, are you?
Yes, I am,
I'm keeping a journal.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.960
I suppose that knife
wasn't your knife?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.529
No, it wasn't.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.130
I actually carry
a Swiss Army knife.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.998
How many drinks
did you have?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
Like, two or three.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.038
Your blood alcohol level
was .12 percent, Willie.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.008
All right, look, you got me.
I had a few more.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.678
You know how it is
when you're tending bar.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.180
No. Tell me.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.983
You act friendly and
people buy you drinks.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.686
Which are watered down
to make more money.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.187
We don't do that at
Sugar Street, all right?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.589
You pick her up
at the club?

06:28.622 --> 06:31.158
No. No, I met her
in the parking lot.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.693
She said she lost her keys.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.894
You ever see her before?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.696
Nope.

06:35.729 --> 06:40.568
I just thought, "Damn, you're
a lucky bastard, Willie."

06:40.601 --> 06:43.871
You get her name, lucky bastard?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.507
Manda, I think.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.208
Ah. Funny.

06:48.241 --> 06:52.145
Dead sailor we found
in your bed was named Manda.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.515
She's not the girl
that I slept with.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.649
What was Manda's
last name?

06:55.683 --> 06:56.717
She didn't say.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.951
Phone number?

06:57.985 --> 06:58.952
I didn't get it.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.788
It all went down kind of fast.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.723
I gave her a kiss,
whoop-de-whoop,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.692
and then it's back to my place
to make some noise.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.695
Anybody see you two
who can verify your story?

07:07.728 --> 07:10.664
No.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.500
You and Manda get in a fight?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.867
No.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.836
Look, look,
we had a good time.

07:15.869 --> 07:16.670
Yeah.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.773
I'd say you had
a real good time.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.974
We found traces of meth
in your blood.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.576
Did you give her meth, too?

07:22.610 --> 07:23.677
No.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.013
We didn't do
any drugs together.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.782
I am telling the truth.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.785
That is not the girl
that I slept with.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.992
Abbs, I need
the condoms tested.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.862
Not the words you want to hear
first thing in the morning.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.696
It's already running.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.097
Not just the inside,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.199
I want to make sure
the outside DNA's tested

07:46.233 --> 07:48.502
and matches that of
Petty Officer Manda King.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.003
Suspect claims he went
to bed with one woman

07:50.037 --> 07:51.038
and woke up with another.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.840
That happens to girls, too.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.742
Midnight, some guy seems
all dark and gnarly,

07:54.775 --> 07:55.743
then you wake up

07:55.776 --> 07:58.546
and his tattoos are fake
and he works at a bank.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.713
I used to work
at a bank.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.914
Your tat is real.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.583
And you don't disappoint me.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.054
Boss, the anonymous phone call

08:07.087 --> 08:09.256
came from a pay phone
outside Willie's apartment.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.223
No fingerprints?

08:10.257 --> 08:11.892
No, and that's weird.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.561
He sleeps with her,
he stabs her,

08:13.594 --> 08:14.895
and there's no prints
on the knife.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.564
Blood matches the victim?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.231
Yeah. The tox screen's
still running,

08:18.265 --> 08:19.867
but it's a safe bet
that it's methamphetamines.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.235
Powder in her
nose was meth.
Yup.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.938
Why would a straight-laced
petty officer OD on meth?

08:24.972 --> 08:27.207
Maybe she's not
so straight-laced.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.810
We all have our funky side.
Except Kate.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.844
And you, boss.

08:30.878 --> 08:31.812
I'm sure you have
no funky side.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.548
Time to find out
who the real Manda King was.

08:35.849 --> 08:41.922
I never thought Manda
would go before me.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.894
Dad's got end-stage
bone cancer.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.330
Did your sister know
a Willie Taylor?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.633
Not that I know.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.835
But, then, she's been at sea
for eight months.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.837
He's not a sailor.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.973
Is that who stabbed
my little girl?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.775
He's a suspect, sir.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.845
You burn him,
won't you,

09:04.878 --> 09:05.946
Agent Gibbs?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.748
If he did it,
you have my word.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.785
Mr. King, can you tell us

09:11.819 --> 09:13.621
a bit about
your daughter, sir?

09:13.654 --> 09:17.157
Manda was tough as nails,

09:17.190 --> 09:20.894
worked hard.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.163
Cared for me,

09:23.196 --> 09:25.766
helped me to raise her.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.603
She'd do anything
for you.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.272
Did you know Manda was promoted
to captain's yeoman?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.009
Yeah, she was a fine sailor.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.911
Which makes what
I'm about to tell you

09:37.945 --> 09:39.112
difficult to hear.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.083
My daughter's dead.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.353
What's worse than that?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.121
We found drug residue
in her nose.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.156
That's a lie.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.258
Manda never did drugs
in her life.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.293
Well, I'm sorry,
but that is what we found.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.028
I don't believe it.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.698
Won't believe it.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.933
You have to come in here
and tell this to my father?

09:59.967 --> 10:02.202
Your sister was murdered.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.838
We have to know
who she really was.

10:06.974 --> 10:10.143
She was my good girl.

10:10.177 --> 10:14.982
That's who she was.

10:15.015 --> 10:19.019
Daddy's good... good girl.

10:26.694 --> 10:27.761
Hey.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.062
DNA test done already?
No.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.098
It's running, but I got
an answer without it.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.933
The fluid on the outside
of the condoms

10:32.966 --> 10:35.002
has a different
blood antigen

10:35.035 --> 10:37.004
than Petty Officer
Manda King.

10:38.739 --> 10:42.175
There's no way Petty Officer
King had sex with Willie Taylor.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.982
Willie was set up.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.192
The knife missed
her vital organs,

10:59.226 --> 11:01.328
so the wound in
and of itself

11:01.361 --> 11:02.863
was not fatal.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.897
She didn't bleed
to death.

11:03.931 --> 11:04.765
Exactly.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.868
Her body contained
four liters of blood,

11:07.901 --> 11:10.103
so there was
no exsanguination.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.071
Ducky...

11:11.104 --> 11:12.205
I'm sorry.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.307
It's such a lovely word,
exsanguination.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.909
I can't help saying it.

11:15.943 --> 11:16.910
( chuckles )

11:16.944 --> 11:18.245
Moving on.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.280
Since there was no bleeding
from the wound....

11:20.313 --> 11:21.849
She was dead
when she was stabbed.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.117
Precisely.
Abby confirmed

11:24.151 --> 11:25.986
the drug in her nose
and blood

11:26.019 --> 11:27.387
was a methamphetamine,

11:27.420 --> 11:31.825
an incredibly large, lethal
dose of methamphetamine.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.894
Someone tried to make
an accidental overdose

11:33.927 --> 11:34.828
look like murder?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.797
I wouldn't call it
an accidental overdose.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.065
No, in cases like this,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.867
where such a
frighteningly high

11:39.900 --> 11:41.168
amount of the drug
is found,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.937
I would say
it was a suicide.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.973
Boss,

11:46.006 --> 11:47.007
Willie Taylor's here.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.749
You know why Norfolk P.D.
delivered you here?

11:55.783 --> 11:59.319
Yeah. I'm a ping-pong ball.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.855
They serve me to you
and you smack me right back.

12:01.889 --> 12:02.655
( chuckles )

12:02.689 --> 12:06.760
No. No, you are telling
the truth.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.429
Petty Officer King OD'd.

12:09.462 --> 12:14.001
After she was dead,
someone stabbed her,

12:14.034 --> 12:16.503
put her in your bed;

12:16.536 --> 12:19.840
made it look
like murder.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.209
Who would do that to you?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.143
Wait a second.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.113
So, you know that
I'm completely innocent?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.848
Man,

12:27.881 --> 12:29.482
don't I get, like,
an apology or nothing?

12:29.516 --> 12:33.020
You get to slide on
using methamphetamines.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.222
I-I don't know.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.958
That's not good enough, man.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.428
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.103
( sighs )

12:50.137 --> 12:52.072
Damn.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.241
Look, uh...
female sailors are,

12:54.274 --> 12:55.909
are like poison.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.911
Anything happens to them--

12:57.945 --> 13:00.413
drugs, sex, anything,
it doesn't matter--

13:00.447 --> 13:03.550
boom, you guys put
our club off limits,
all right?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.953
No sailors,
you ain't got no Sugar Street.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.921
Who'd benefit from that?

13:07.955 --> 13:10.991
Uh, yeah, well, Ian Hitch.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.093
He owns Teaz,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.194
and we're his only real
competition.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.064
If that sailor OD'd
in his club,

13:17.097 --> 13:18.565
he would need to get
the stink off fast.

13:18.598 --> 13:22.069
And shut Sugar Street down
in the process.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.403
Yeah, it's the kind of stunt

13:23.436 --> 13:25.072
that limey bastard
would pull, too.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.044
McGEE:
Ian Hitch, AKA "Bulldog."

13:31.078 --> 13:33.180
American mother, English father.
Dual citizenship.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.848
According to Scotland Yard,

13:34.882 --> 13:36.016
he was charged
with murder twice

13:36.049 --> 13:38.185
in Manchester,
skated both times.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.088
I'm afraid to ask,
why "Bulldog"?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.122
I don't know.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.191
Bulldog bites you in the ass
and never lets go.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.093
He owns Teaz in Norfolk.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.597
Yeah, well, when I was stationed
there, I-I heard about it.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.132
Apparently,
there's some

13:52.165 --> 13:53.500
very hot dancers there.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.868
You heard?

13:54.902 --> 13:56.169
Yeah. Well, I never went there.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.337
Honest.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.005
Okay.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.207
Hey, it seems to me that...

14:00.240 --> 14:02.309
Why are you looking
at me like that for?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.977
Oh, I'm just waiting
for you to say,

14:04.011 --> 14:06.379
"Boss, let me take
the lead on this one!"

14:06.413 --> 14:07.380
( chuckles )

14:07.414 --> 14:09.182
What I was going to say, Kate,

14:09.216 --> 14:12.152
was that if Hitch used a girl
to seduce Willie Taylor,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.453
it was probably one
of his dancers.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
We get Willie
to identify Ms. Go-Go

14:15.588 --> 14:17.925
and flip her
to get to Hitch.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.093
( clears throat )

14:20.127 --> 14:21.028
What are you doing?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.462
Oh, just chronicling
this little conversation

14:22.495 --> 14:24.932
for our next session with Ducky.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.066
You done?

14:26.099 --> 14:26.633
Almost.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.968
"Done" or "fired"

14:28.001 --> 14:29.036
are the choices.

14:29.069 --> 14:29.869
Done.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.371
Should we take Willie
to the club

14:31.404 --> 14:32.305
to identify the girl?

14:32.339 --> 14:35.909
No. I don't want him
anywhere near Hitch.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.644
Boss, I will find out
who dances at the club

14:37.677 --> 14:39.179
and pull their DMV photos.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.013
Not going
to work, McGee.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.014
Girls at the club

14:41.048 --> 14:42.115
work for tips, Probie.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.250
No W-2 forms.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.585
And names like "Tiffany Glitter"
and "Stormy Weathers"

14:45.618 --> 14:47.554
they don't appear
on driver's licenses.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.189
Boss, I really think
I should take...

14:50.323 --> 14:51.424
the lead on this one.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.127
( chuckling )

14:59.532 --> 15:01.301
All right,

15:01.334 --> 15:02.502
it's looking good.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.178
Let's see Tony.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.113
Well, what do you know?

15:13.146 --> 15:15.015
DiNozzo is finally looking

15:15.048 --> 15:16.649
where he is supposed
to be looking.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.684
I heard that.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.356
How's that?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.657
Well, it's art,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.493
but we kind of need
a shot of her face.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.030
I could make a fortune
on the Internet with this.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.398
Okay, got it.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.333
Next!

15:33.366 --> 15:34.334
TONY:
Right, boss.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.136
Just being thorough.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.413
GIBBS:
That's it.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.957
( chuckles nervously )

16:09.269 --> 16:11.104
I'm watching you, DiNozzo.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.377
How's that look?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.411
Uh, closer.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.746
Is this better?

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
One second.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.551
Did ya get it yet?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.153
( computer trilling )

16:28.688 --> 16:29.656
Wow, Kate,

16:29.689 --> 16:31.124
how'd you get her to do that?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
DiNozzo, go back
to the last booth.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.470
Yeah, right there.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.471
That Hitch?

16:49.209 --> 16:49.576
That's him.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.279
DJ:
What's up, party people!

16:52.312 --> 16:55.282
Tonight is going to be hot,
but this crowd is even hotter

16:55.315 --> 16:57.417
'cause only the best
get into Teaz.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.820
I'm DJ Night Trap, and I'm gonna
get off the mike right now

17:00.853 --> 17:03.123
because I know
who you came here to see...

17:03.156 --> 17:04.191
Jade!

17:04.224 --> 17:06.093
( cheering )

17:09.262 --> 17:13.032
( pop music playing )

17:15.535 --> 17:18.271
* Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh

17:18.305 --> 17:19.439
That's Samantha King.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.574
* Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh

17:23.643 --> 17:26.546
* Sophisticated lady

17:26.579 --> 17:29.316
* But nasty when I want to be

17:31.318 --> 17:35.355
* I see you staring
from across the room *

17:35.388 --> 17:37.257
* And you can't keep
your eyes off me... *

17:39.359 --> 17:41.828
Hey, Tony, stop jumping
up and down.

17:41.861 --> 17:42.695
We can't see.

17:42.729 --> 17:47.300
* Like a puppet
on a string, whoo! *

17:47.334 --> 17:51.838
* Have you in cuffs
like cops and robbers, baby *

17:51.871 --> 17:54.307
* 'Cause touching me's
a felony *

17:54.341 --> 18:00.380
* Put your hands up
'cause I'm cold-blooded *

18:00.413 --> 18:04.251
* Boy, who does it belong to?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.520
* Cold-blooded

18:08.855 --> 18:11.491
* It ain't that complicated.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.892
Thanks. That was fun.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.661
Now get out.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.197
( cheering )

18:26.673 --> 18:28.375
Taking your sister's death
pretty hard, Jade.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.178
What are you doing here?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.112
The question is:
What are you doing here?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.718
What are you afraid of?

18:38.751 --> 18:40.253
Who are you?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.355
Same as Kate.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.923
Well, not exactly.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.925
Answer my question.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.629
It's Saturday night.
I sing here, okay?

18:49.662 --> 18:52.165
Oh, you sing the day
after your sister's murdered?

18:52.199 --> 18:53.500
I gotta go.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.335
Not unless we get some answers.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.669
Blue, you better get out here.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.840
You know how we found you?

19:00.873 --> 19:03.543
We were here looking
for your sister's murderer.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.449
You said you had her murderer.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.450
He didn't do it.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.751
What's going on, Jade?

19:12.719 --> 19:13.353
We're just talking.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.821
Well, not no more you ain't.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.423
Yeah, I think we are.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.227
My partner, Lulu,

19:20.260 --> 19:21.828
she wants to sign Jade
to a record contract.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.596
Bulldog ain't gonna like that.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.299
Twinkle Toes, Candy Pants,
stay behind your mommy.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.600
Where'd Bulldog get his name?

19:27.634 --> 19:31.338
When he gets his teeth
into a girl's arse,

19:31.371 --> 19:32.339
he never lets go.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.607
I knew it. I knew it.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.976
Lulu, I was right about Bulldog.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.446
You're gonna get me killed.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.947
Just like your sister was?

19:40.980 --> 19:43.550
Look, we think Hitch
had her killed. Why?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.218
No, he wouldn't do that.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.387
I mean, he knew she wanted
me to leave this life,

19:47.420 --> 19:49.389
but he wouldn't kill her.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.358
Wouldn't he?

19:54.994 --> 19:57.264
Let's go, Bruce!
She's not interested!

19:57.297 --> 19:58.465
No harm, no foul.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.435
Guess not.

20:02.469 --> 20:06.339
Gosh, those guys were big.
Big, big, big, big.

20:08.608 --> 20:12.412
Mm-hmm. She's cute.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.580
She's hot.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.382
I don't know about you,

20:15.415 --> 20:17.417
but I sleep with
a lot of women, so...

20:17.450 --> 20:18.685
I wouldn't know anything
about that, Willie.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.752
I'm a Mormon.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.289
Oh.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.658
I'm sorry.

20:25.692 --> 20:26.726
I'm, uh, you know,

20:26.759 --> 20:28.261
I think it could be
this one here.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.363
But I was
really drunk, so...

20:31.431 --> 20:32.399
Sit down.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.034
You're going
to have to do better.

20:35.067 --> 20:39.005
Look, man, I'm doing
the best I can, all right?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.707
All right. All right.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.545
Yeah, I think
it's her.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.448
Summer Diamond. Very hot.

20:48.481 --> 20:52.051
You "think"
this is her?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.486
Look, there's
always something

20:53.520 --> 20:54.787
about every woman
that you remember,

20:54.821 --> 20:56.856
something small and subtle.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.525
Something you're going
to remember 20 years later:

20:58.558 --> 21:03.663
A piece of jewelry,
a laugh, something.

21:03.696 --> 21:04.664
A smell.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.665
KATE:
Ugh!

21:05.698 --> 21:07.334
I feel like I died and woke up

21:07.367 --> 21:08.368
in a Calvin Klein ad.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.602
I thought you were a Mormon?

21:09.636 --> 21:10.803
Concentrate, Willie.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
( sighs )

21:13.340 --> 21:15.775
Ah, yeah.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.477
She had a tat.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.478
How could I forget?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.479
What did it look like?

21:19.512 --> 21:21.481
It was of a bulldog.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.850
It was right there
on her ass.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.452
Sweet Slick Willie.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.420
Look at that.
The devil is in the details.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.988
I knew this girl once.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.022
She squeaked.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.591
She made this little squeak...

21:31.624 --> 21:33.059
Tony, do you want
to tell Ducky that story?

21:33.092 --> 21:34.727
Ducky's already
heard it. We all have.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.062
It's a good story.

21:36.095 --> 21:36.929
Then you tell it to Kate

21:36.963 --> 21:38.531
while you're bringing in
Summer Diamond.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.534
Don't I get to hear it?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.936
You recognize this man?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.037
SUMMER:
Nope.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.508
He works
at Sugar Street.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.676
Ever been there?

21:49.709 --> 21:51.478
I work six nights
a week at Teaz.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.812
The last place
I'm going to go

21:52.845 --> 21:54.481
on my night off
is another club.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.086
You recognize this?

22:02.989 --> 22:04.457
Agent Todd took that photo.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.793
It is of your rear end.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.661
You always get
the best jobs.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.630
Willie described it
perfectly.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.099
I dance practically naked.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.034
Hundreds of guys
have seen my ass.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.604
So, you didn't sleep with him
two nights ago?

22:17.637 --> 22:18.905
No.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.941
Willie says he's never been
to your club.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.610
You know what?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.978
I believe him.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.682
Every dancer in the club
has that tat.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.851
It means
we're in Bulldog's crew.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.020
I'd have thought
he'd use a bite mark.

22:34.053 --> 22:34.954
( knocking )

22:34.987 --> 22:35.988
GIBBS:
Enter.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.392
We have a court order

22:39.426 --> 22:41.861
for a DNA sample, Ms. Diamond.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.532
Open your mouth.
It doesn't hurt.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.070
Compare it to the DNA
found on the condoms

22:51.103 --> 22:52.872
in Willie Taylor's apartment.

22:52.905 --> 22:53.873
Jethro, Jethro.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.842
I need you.
I need you, like, now.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.378
I'm sorry, Jethro,

22:59.412 --> 23:02.515
because of the chemical burns
from the methamphetamines

23:02.549 --> 23:05.552
and the bleeding,
I-I missed this.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.488
There. There,
you see it?

23:08.521 --> 23:10.089
Almost a perfect circle.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.059
I know I said that the cause
of a massive overdose

23:13.092 --> 23:14.527
was usually suicide,

23:14.561 --> 23:15.962
but then I got
to thinking.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.464
Always a good thing.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.566
I mean, that mark
was made by the end

23:19.599 --> 23:22.034
of a hard, round tube,

23:22.068 --> 23:22.902
like the end of a funnel.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.804
You don't commit suicide
by pouring meth

23:24.837 --> 23:27.507
through a funnel
into your nose.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.844
No. It was a horrible,
painful death.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.521
You know what'll happen

23:41.554 --> 23:43.122
if he finds out
I'm talking to you?

23:43.155 --> 23:46.726
Don't you want to know
how your sister died, Samantha?

23:47.894 --> 23:49.128
She was stabbed?

23:49.161 --> 23:50.630
Yes, she was,

23:50.663 --> 23:52.031
but that wasn't
what killed her.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.133
Your sister was restrained

23:54.166 --> 23:56.469
and methamphetamine
was forced

23:56.503 --> 23:57.837
down her nose
and her throat

23:57.870 --> 23:59.539
until her heart failed.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.974
Oh, God... Manda.

24:02.008 --> 24:02.909
Look, Willie Taylor

24:02.942 --> 24:05.044
believes that he's
been framed for her murder

24:05.077 --> 24:06.679
by your boss Ian Hitch.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.748
Bulldog wouldn't, he...

24:08.781 --> 24:10.216
Why not?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.818
Sugar Street
gets declared off limits

24:11.851 --> 24:14.621
and Club Teaz gets
a huge surge of new clientele.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.760
But that's isn't why
it happened, is it, Samantha?

24:23.062 --> 24:25.698
Our mom died when I
was three, Agent Todd.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.767
Manda practically raised me.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.503
When she found out
I was working for Hitch,

24:30.537 --> 24:32.004
she lost it.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.574
How'd you get hooked up
with a guy like that?

24:34.607 --> 24:36.876
He said he had connections
with record companies,

24:36.909 --> 24:39.846
that he'd make me a star.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.147
I believed him.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.915
But your sister didn't.

24:42.949 --> 24:46.152
She was always the smart one
in the family.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.921
Why didn't you
just walk away?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.857
I signed a contract
with him.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.925
Manda was trying
to get me out of it.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.094
And he had her killed.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.830
Look we got to get you
someplace safe...

24:57.864 --> 24:59.532
You don't get it, do you?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.133
Hitch owns me.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.236
I sing when he wants,
dance when he wants.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.739
I sleep with him when he wants.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.808
No one walks away
from him...

25:08.841 --> 25:10.142
ever.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.545
He murdered your sister,
Samantha.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.880
And you'll never prove it.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.815
They never do.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.016
( cell phone rings )

25:19.819 --> 25:20.787
It's him.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.722
Don't answer it.
( cell phone rings )

25:22.755 --> 25:25.658
I have to.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.659
What are you doing, love?

25:26.693 --> 25:27.827
Some shopping, baby.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.895
Really?

25:28.928 --> 25:30.863
It looks like you're having
a spot of tea to me.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.906
If he finds out you're a cop,
I am dead.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.654
Lulu, I presume?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.758
Didn't get my message
last night?

25:58.791 --> 26:00.126
Jade here already
has a manager.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.061
That's what I told her, Ian.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.696
Did I ask you to speak, love?

26:13.940 --> 26:17.977
So, tell me, what label
do you scout for?

26:20.980 --> 26:22.782
Well, that's none
of your business.

26:22.815 --> 26:26.018
Ah, but it is if you're
after my property.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.860
Is she available?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.729
Only to me.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.700
Say good-bye
to Lulu, love.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.037
Good-bye, Lulu.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.744
You and your friend Bruce
might want to leave town

26:51.778 --> 26:53.880
tonight.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.856
You should have had backup
yesterday, Kate.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.392
Well, I didn't expect
Hitch to show up, Gibbs.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.796
It won't happen again.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.398
I know.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.935
McGee, how'd he track her?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.937
Well, Samantha's
cell phone number

27:17.970 --> 27:18.971
is registered to Ian Hitch.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.372
So he's probably using

27:20.406 --> 27:22.909
the imbedded GPS to keep tabs
on her location.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.443
Paranoid.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.878
Kind of reminds me of someone.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.781
What I meant was, most managers

27:28.815 --> 27:29.982
are afraid of losing
their stars.

27:30.016 --> 27:33.152
With a voice like that, Samantha
could be the next Brandy.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.687
What's a Brandy?

27:34.721 --> 27:38.224
She's a singer
and an actress, boss.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.191
She's very, very hot.

27:39.225 --> 27:42.161
The point is, Hitch
isn't going to let her go.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.796
He'd kill her first.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.098
( telephone rings )

27:46.132 --> 27:47.199
Yeah. Gibbs.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.839
We're on our way.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.944
Norfolk Homicide found
the body of a young woman.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.915
She had my card in her bra.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.053
MAUCERI:
We just ID'd her.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.789
Keisha Scott.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.390
Looks like a hit-and-run, Gibbs.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.425
Her club name's
Summer Diamond.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.161
She was in our interrogation
room yesterday.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.730
Willie Taylor ID'd her
as the girl he had sex with,

28:17.764 --> 28:18.965
not Petty Officer King.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.466
She cop to it?

28:20.499 --> 28:24.971
If she did, she'd be in
NCIS custody instead of dead.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.939
No chance this was
an accident.
Nope.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.007
Ian Hitch is involved.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.342
Bulldog?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.811
Explains a lot.

28:31.844 --> 28:32.879
No witnesses,

28:32.912 --> 28:35.247
nobody in the neighborhood
heard anything last night.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.448
He's got this part of town

28:36.482 --> 28:38.084
in his pocket.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.019
Yeah, how about you?

28:40.052 --> 28:42.989
I'll pretend I didn't
hear that, Gibbs.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.824
Either way,
I'm taking him down.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.994
You might find who did this,
but connecting him to Bulldog?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.896
Uh-uh, ain't going
to happen.

28:49.929 --> 28:53.900
Well, no, not if you keep
letting him skate, Mauceri.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.268
Hey, I've been down
this road before, Gibbs.

28:56.302 --> 28:57.536
I bring him in for questioning,

28:57.569 --> 28:59.171
his lawyer'll have him
out before lunch.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.507
I got a better idea.
Yeah?

29:01.540 --> 29:05.211
Yeah. You turn jurisdiction
over on this to me this time.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.213
Well, you got it.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.316
How soon can you get
the rest of your team here?

29:10.349 --> 29:14.086
Oh, pretty soon.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.988
( whistles )

29:23.029 --> 29:24.530
No way this was
hit-and-run, boss.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.865
She's practically naked.

29:25.898 --> 29:26.999
It was 35 degrees this morning.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.968
You see that, Mr. Palmer?

29:29.001 --> 29:30.502
Someone was holding

29:30.536 --> 29:33.906
her arms tightly
before her death.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.508
Enough to cause these bruises.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.012
She was shoved in front
of a vehicle, Duck?

29:40.046 --> 29:41.047
It's possible.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.050
I'll know more when I get
the poor girl back home.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.986
KATE:
We've got some broken glass
over here.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.988
Looking at the thickness,
maybe a headlight.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.122
Bag it.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.358
McGee!
Yeah, boss?

29:52.391 --> 29:54.026
Locals think
it was a hit-and-run.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.194
What about you?

29:56.395 --> 29:58.998
Me? Um...

29:59.031 --> 30:01.901
Me, uh...

30:01.934 --> 30:03.335
Answer the man, Probie.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.073
I don't think so.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.875
Why?

30:10.076 --> 30:11.944
Well, uh, there are
no skid marks

30:11.978 --> 30:13.512
before or after the body.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.547
Whoever hit her
didn't even slow down.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.252
Kate, take DiNozzo
and pick up Samantha.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.054
Make sure her cell phone's off.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.622
Don't tell her about Summer.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.425
I want to know
where this dirt bag was

30:26.458 --> 30:29.061
the night Petty Officer King
was murdered.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.129
And where he was last night

30:30.162 --> 30:33.199
when Summer decided to go
for a walk half naked.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.366
You got it, boss.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.070
It's supposed to be my day off.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.305
How do you know Hitch
won't find out

30:39.338 --> 30:41.007
I'm not at the hospital
with my father?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.909
He won't.
When our computer geek's
done your phone,

30:42.942 --> 30:44.010
it'll show you were
there all day.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.612
Probie, rig the GPS chip.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.981
Location: Norfolk Hospital,

30:49.015 --> 30:51.017
noon to 1730.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.151
You can really do that?

30:52.184 --> 30:53.886
Sure.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.121
I've already told your people,

30:55.154 --> 30:57.156
I'm not talking about this,
Agent Gibbs.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.490
So can we please
make this quick?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.226
You're not here to talk.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.161
You're here to see.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.295
What?

31:03.329 --> 31:04.630
A friend.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.341
Oh, God, Summer.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.512
Summer...

31:23.049 --> 31:24.550
This is not happening.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.486
How did this...?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.388
How do you think?

31:29.421 --> 31:31.690
She has a two-year-old.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.425
Even Bulldog couldn't...
Bulldog's tying up

31:33.459 --> 31:34.660
his loose ends, Samantha.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.162
All you have to do
is cooperate with us

31:36.195 --> 31:38.530
and we'll take him
out of your life for good.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.132
I can't.
Don't you understand?

31:40.166 --> 31:41.400
Your sister's in the freezer.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.602
Maybe you'd like
to say good-bye?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.037
Summer talked to you!

31:45.071 --> 31:46.939
That's why she's lying
on that slab.

31:46.973 --> 31:49.141
It's not happening to me.

31:49.175 --> 31:50.943
You're right.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.312
It's happening because of you.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.081
Okay.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.215
Either charge me
with something

31:56.248 --> 31:57.583
or I'm out of here.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.485
Now.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.656
You're making
a big mistake, Samantha.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.692
Once you walk
out those doors,
we can't protect you.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.128
Boss, Hitch has got
a very good alibi

32:09.161 --> 32:10.029
for last night.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.631
He was in New York
promoting his club.

32:12.664 --> 32:15.134
The photos here are
from the gossip page

32:15.167 --> 32:17.103
of The Eastsider
this morning.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.237
I checked with
the airlines.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.639
He didn't get back
until 1100 today.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.277
He always wins.

32:25.311 --> 32:28.014
I tried to tell my sister that.
She didn't listen.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.549
And I hope you do
before I end up dead, too.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.358
GIBBS:
Cause of death?

32:39.391 --> 32:42.694
DUCKY:
She received
several fatal injuries

32:42.728 --> 32:44.363
consistent with
vehicular homicide.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.765
If I had to pick one?

32:46.798 --> 32:48.734
Hmm. Internal bleeding.

32:48.767 --> 32:52.338
Although, her neck
was broken on impact,

32:52.371 --> 32:53.505
damaging her spinal cord

32:53.539 --> 32:54.773
and carotid artery.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.744
I'm afraid even
if you'd survived, my dear,

32:58.777 --> 33:01.013
you would never have danced
again.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.448
GIBBS:
Drugs?

33:02.481 --> 33:05.117
Well, the tox screen showed
a mixture of methamphetamine

33:05.151 --> 33:07.419
and alcohol
in her blood.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.455
But not enough to kill her
like our petty officer.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.722
What about the bruising?

33:10.756 --> 33:13.259
Well, these bruises
here on her arms

33:13.292 --> 33:16.428
were made by somebody
holding her tightly.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.364
I wish I could tell you more.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.666
Yeah, Duck, so do I.

33:20.699 --> 33:24.703
Jethro, there is a procedure
Abby could use

33:24.736 --> 33:27.673
to lift the fingerprints
off these bruises.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.108
Off of dead skin?

33:29.141 --> 33:31.410
Yeah, only we'd need
your approval.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.511
Why?

33:32.544 --> 33:37.716
Well, it's prohibitively
expensive and rarely works.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.419
So's getting married.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.620
Do it.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.389
( chuckles )

33:43.422 --> 33:45.291
Are you done yet?
( typing )

33:46.858 --> 33:48.694
I'm going as fast
as I can.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.363
Do you mind?

33:51.397 --> 33:52.298
No.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.134
( sighs )

33:55.167 --> 33:56.435
( computer beeping )

33:56.468 --> 33:57.269
Now I'm done.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.804
Okay, put it on the plasma,
Probie.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.473
( chuckles )

34:01.507 --> 34:02.841
Did you really make these
yourself, Kate?

34:02.874 --> 34:03.842
I did.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.744
'Cause they're delicious.

34:05.777 --> 34:06.712
I didn't know
you could cook.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.081
Well, technically, it's baking,

34:09.115 --> 34:11.049
and there's a lot about me
you don't know, Tony.

34:12.318 --> 34:12.851
Hey, Kate, could I try one?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.486
Of course, McGee.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.456
I made enough for all....

34:18.490 --> 34:21.127
Tony, there were
a dozen in here.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.162
They're really delicious.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.331
Okay, what do you have for me?

34:25.364 --> 34:26.165
A way to keep tabs

34:26.198 --> 34:27.766
on Samantha King's
location, boss.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.803
I think that one
was for....

34:34.440 --> 34:35.341
When I...

34:35.374 --> 34:37.743
when I rigged
the GPS chip in her phone,

34:37.776 --> 34:39.678
I also downloaded the code.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.713
So now we can follow her
anywhere she goes.

34:41.747 --> 34:44.650
She's 20 miles outside
of Norfolk on Route 64.

34:44.683 --> 34:45.884
Good work, McGee.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.686
That's a good job.

34:47.719 --> 34:48.520
Thank you, boss,

34:48.554 --> 34:50.222
but actually,
it was Tony's idea.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.191
I'm impressed,
DiNozzo.

34:53.225 --> 34:56.162
Just trying
to help out, boss.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.229
Uh...

34:57.263 --> 34:58.264
That's so not right.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.831
McGee,
Abby needs help.

34:59.865 --> 35:00.799
Tony, Kate,
you're with me.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.368
Where're we going?
!
Norfolk.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.270
We're going

35:04.303 --> 35:06.772
to pay Ian Hitch a visit.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.707
What about blowing
our cover as
talent scouts?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.409
Samantha is leaving with us.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.777
She changed
her mind, boss?

35:11.810 --> 35:12.911
Does not matter.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.913
I'm not letting her
end up

35:14.946 --> 35:16.582
like her sister
downstairs.

35:17.883 --> 35:21.753
So, uh, how's this supposed
to work exactly?

35:21.787 --> 35:22.788
Good question.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.424
I've never actually done it
on a body before.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.526
We'll figure it out
together, Jimmy.

35:27.559 --> 35:30.229
Oh, please,
call me Jimmy.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.464
I just did.

35:32.498 --> 35:33.865
Oh, sorry.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.834
I guess
I didn't hear you.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.170
So, this stuff
is basically Super Glue.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.906
It bonds instantly
with almost anything.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.841
And then when it's heated,

35:42.874 --> 35:44.576
the vapors are attracted
to proteins

35:44.610 --> 35:47.279
and fats left behind
from a human fingerprint.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.180
And when they dry,

35:48.214 --> 35:49.848
you can just peel 'em
off like a sticker.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.683
Oh.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.719
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
I'll get it.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.820
I got it.

35:54.853 --> 35:55.554
Ow!

35:58.557 --> 35:59.791
I'm sorry, my fault,

35:59.825 --> 36:02.228
My fault.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.895
Um, okay, you know,

36:03.929 --> 36:05.464
I think that this
would be better

36:05.497 --> 36:06.898
if I just did this
by myself.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.467
I was only trying
to observe.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.468
Okay.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.970
You can let go
of my arms now.

36:12.003 --> 36:12.971
Right.

36:13.004 --> 36:13.872
Oh, um,

36:13.905 --> 36:15.974
I'm, I'm trying.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.878
Well, try harder!
Jimmy!

36:19.911 --> 36:21.480
( laughs nervously )

36:21.513 --> 36:25.317
I can't. I'm, um...
uh, uh...

36:25.351 --> 36:27.219
I'm stuck here.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.922
Palmer, what the hell
are you doing?!

36:30.956 --> 36:32.791
( nervous chuckle )

36:33.925 --> 36:37.596
McGee, acetone
and Band-Aids-- fast!

36:37.629 --> 36:40.499
KATE:
I'm tracking her GPS signal,
Gibbs.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.800
Samantha's back at the club.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.835
DiNozzo?

36:43.869 --> 36:45.971
( snoring )

36:46.004 --> 36:48.240
I'll wake him up.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.941
No, no.

36:49.975 --> 36:50.942
I got a better idea.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.912
Hold on.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.681
( tires screech )

36:56.882 --> 36:57.849
( grunts )

36:57.883 --> 37:01.587
( chuckling )

37:01.620 --> 37:02.621
Bad dream, Tony?

37:02.654 --> 37:03.855
I thought I....

37:03.889 --> 37:04.790
Call Abby,

37:04.823 --> 37:07.926
see if she got any prints
off the body.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.828
Sure, boss.
( laughs )

37:09.861 --> 37:11.530
You know, you didn't have

37:11.563 --> 37:12.598
to yell at him.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.999
Jimmy is terrified of you now.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.434
He is?

37:15.467 --> 37:16.602
Cool.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.637
This is the last print.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.440
It's a partial
from the right bruise.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.343
Any luck with the prints
from the left arm, he-man?

37:24.376 --> 37:27.813
Still running them through AFIS.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.848
Look, I'll apologize
to him later.

37:29.881 --> 37:30.849
I just...

37:30.882 --> 37:32.017
Ooh, we got a match.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.054
It's one of Hitch's bouncers,

37:36.087 --> 37:38.023
Richard "Blue" McGinty.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.358
All right, I got it.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.292
Thanks, Abby.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.328
Yeah, they got a print
off Summer's body.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.962
It's the bouncer from outside
the club the other night.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.799
( tires screeching )

37:50.001 --> 37:52.304
Jade, Bulldog wants to see you.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.776
You okay, sweetheart?

37:57.809 --> 37:58.977
I don't know
how much more

37:59.010 --> 38:00.579
of this I can
take, Blue.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.614
When you're a star,

38:02.648 --> 38:04.716
this'll all seem
like a bad dream.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.353
I'm having second thoughts
about the dream.

38:07.386 --> 38:12.324
It's kind of late for that,
isn't it, Samantha?

38:19.097 --> 38:21.433
You wanted to see me?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.068
Close the door, Jade.

38:24.670 --> 38:27.973
It seems that Lulu isn't
a talent scout after all.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.013
She's a Navy cop.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.849
I didn't know, Ian.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.518
I swear.

38:39.551 --> 38:43.355
What did you tell them,
that I killed your sister?

38:43.389 --> 38:45.357
I didn't tell them anything!

38:45.391 --> 38:48.694
Now, why don't I believe you,
Jade?

38:49.795 --> 38:50.996
( hammer cocks )

38:55.934 --> 38:57.503
( beeping )

38:57.536 --> 39:00.005
She's inside.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.008
If you shoot me,
they'll know it was you, Ian.

39:03.041 --> 39:03.875
Tell me the game
you're playing

39:03.909 --> 39:05.711
and I'll try
and bear that in mind then.

39:05.744 --> 39:09.080
I'm not playing any games.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.116
That's not what
Summer said.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.553
Did you know she's dead?

39:16.187 --> 39:19.725
Oh... of course you do.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.128
( two gunshots )

39:24.095 --> 39:25.531
( women shrieking )

39:34.039 --> 39:36.442
( screaming )

39:40.045 --> 39:42.180
Put the weapon down.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.515
He was going to kill her.

39:44.650 --> 39:47.085
I didn't have a choice.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.422
Drop it.

40:08.907 --> 40:09.908
( beeping )

40:11.543 --> 40:12.911
You have everything ready
for shipment to Norfolk?

40:12.944 --> 40:13.545
Working on it.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.880
There might be a problem,

40:14.913 --> 40:15.881
though, Gibbs.

40:15.914 --> 40:16.615
What kind of problem?

40:16.648 --> 40:18.550
I got back Summer
Diamond's DNA,

40:18.584 --> 40:19.751
and it does not match

40:19.785 --> 40:21.653
the DNA we took
off the condoms

40:21.687 --> 40:22.654
at the first crime scene.

40:22.688 --> 40:23.989
She didn't set Willie Taylor up.

40:24.022 --> 40:24.990
Nope.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.224
The weird thing is,

40:26.257 --> 40:27.793
I did get a near match

40:27.826 --> 40:29.928
from the Armed Forces
DNA Registry.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.563
He was set up by a sailor?

40:38.136 --> 40:40.739
I'm going to make you proud,
Daddy,

40:40.772 --> 40:44.142
just like you were of Manda.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.111
Everybody's going
to know my name.

40:46.144 --> 40:50.649
I was always proud of you,
Sammy.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.653
My baby

40:54.686 --> 40:58.256
the pop star.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.558
Wish I...

40:59.591 --> 41:03.094
wish we

41:03.128 --> 41:06.164
could be around to see.

41:06.197 --> 41:09.134
Manda always loved
your singing.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.869
We need to talk.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.173
Outside.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.176
He only has a few hours left,
Agent Gibbs.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.145
Is this about Blue?

41:20.178 --> 41:22.113
It's about you.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.050
Summer Diamond didn't
set your sister up.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.554
Were you going to split
the money with Blue?

41:28.587 --> 41:29.955
Or record a demo with it?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.289
We know,

41:31.322 --> 41:33.792
Samantha--
your big sister told us.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.595
Or more appropriately,
her DNA.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.230
There's a 70% match
of the DNA found

41:39.264 --> 41:40.966
on the condoms in Willie
Taylor's apartment.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.267
Only a sibling
could be that close.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.169
We also had access
to your phone, Samantha.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.237
Guess where the GPS chip
puts you

41:46.271 --> 41:48.707
on the nights your sister
and Summer Diamond died?

41:48.740 --> 41:50.208
Setting up Ian Hitch
was a nice touch.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.911
Gets you out of that crappy
record contract you signed

41:52.944 --> 41:55.246
and you get all
your dad's money.

41:58.884 --> 42:03.555
She's dead and still
screwing with my life.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.726
Go say good-bye to your father.

42:07.759 --> 42:11.296
If I were you,
I'd keep lying to him.

42:14.966 --> 42:17.268
( EKG beeping )

42:17.302 --> 42:20.672
I always believed in you,

42:20.706 --> 42:23.341
even when your sister didn't.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.276
( labored breathing )

42:27.679 --> 42:30.682
You're gonna make it,

42:30.716 --> 42:35.020
you're gonna be famous.

42:35.053 --> 42:39.557
I can feel it.

42:41.827 --> 42:42.794
( gasps )

42:42.828 --> 42:46.798
( steady tone sounds )

42:46.832 --> 42:49.801
That's right, Daddy.

42:49.835 --> 42:57.308
I'm going to be a real star.
