WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.504
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MOVING
TO CHICAGO. I'M THINKING ABOUT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.005
GETTING SOME CHAIN

00:05.005 --> 00:07.138
AND JUST LOCKING YOU UP
TO THAT PIPE OVER THERE.

00:07.138 --> 00:10.081
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

00:10.081 --> 00:12.513
(Jules) OHH.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.116
THAT IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD TRAVIS SAY,

00:15.116 --> 00:17.518
"I LOVE YOU, TOO,"
WITHOUT IT BEING FOLLOWED BY,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.090
"NOW STOP
WATCHING ME SLEEP, MOM."

00:19.090 --> 00:22.293
IF YOU KEEP SPYING ON YOUR SON,
THE KARMA GODS WILL PUNISH YOU.

00:22.293 --> 00:25.296
HOPEFULLY THE KARMA GODS
ARE BUSY HAVING LUNCH WITH SANTA

00:25.296 --> 00:29.400
AT A RESTAURANT CALLED
"WE DON'T EXIST."

00:29.400 --> 00:32.263
I THINK I'LL BE FINE--
AAH! OHH!
(thumping)

00:34.505 --> 00:37.638
STUPID KARMA GODS.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.640
SPRAINED KNEE, HUH?
YEAH.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.274
THAT SUCKS. BRIGHT SIDE--
YOU LOOK LIKE A PIMP.

00:43.274 --> 00:46.617
YOU BETTER PAY MY BITCHES!
(laughs) THAT'S FUN.

00:46.617 --> 00:49.550
YOU KNOW, I'M FINE. US COBBS
CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.823
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR SON
WALKING AROUND WITH GRANDMA'S

00:52.823 --> 00:55.826
ENGAGEMENT RING IN HIS POCKET,
TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO KEEP

00:55.826 --> 00:58.489
HIS GIRLFRIEND FROM MOVING?
I WONDER WHAT HE'LL DO.

00:58.489 --> 01:01.832
MAYBE TRAV WILL JUST SKIP
THE RING AND PUT A BABY IN HER.

01:01.832 --> 01:05.696
THAT'S WHAT JELLY BEAN WOULD DO.
IT'S NO FUN WHEN SHE'S NOT HERE.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.299
YOU CAN'T FIX THIS ONE
WITH A CANE.

01:08.299 --> 01:11.472
UNLESS YOU USE IT TO PIMP-WHACK
KIRSTEN OVER THE HEAD.

01:11.472 --> 01:15.106
NO. I JUST HOPE
THAT WHEN HE PROPOSES,

01:15.106 --> 01:17.508
KIRSTEN HAS ENOUGH SENSE
TO SAY NO.

01:17.508 --> 01:19.610
(British accent)
MARRY ME, MILADY.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.213
(high-pitched voice) OH, GOD.
IT'S AN EVERYTHING RING.

01:22.213 --> 01:23.214
PIMP-WHACK.

01:23.214 --> 01:24.685
OHH!

01:24.685 --> 01:27.488
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP WITH TRAV?
JUST BE THERE FOR HIM.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.090
(imitates Travis) WHAT IF
HE TALKS IN SUCH A MONOTONE WAY

01:30.090 --> 01:33.424
THAT I PASS OUT FROM...
(normal voice) DON'T WHACK ME.
LOOK, YOU AND TRAVIS
ALWAYS GIVE EACH OTHER CRAP.

01:33.424 --> 01:36.427
WOULD IT KILL YOU TO LOOK HIM
IN THE EYE AND SAY,

01:36.427 --> 01:39.770
"HEY, BUDDY. HOW'S IT GOIN'?"
ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I WEAR
THESE TIGHT T-SHIRTS YOU BUY ME?

01:39.770 --> 01:43.574
I MEAN, PEOPLE ASSUME
I KNOW FARSI.
I LIKE TO SEE WHAT I PAY FOR.

01:43.574 --> 01:47.608
(chuckles)
HE'S MY SON. I WANT TO KNOW
THAT HE CAN COUNT ON YOU.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.340
OKAY. I'LL TRY.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.642
(both imitate whip cracking)
WHAT ARE YOU, 6?

01:51.642 --> 01:55.316
GROW UP. SWEETIE, COULD YOU
GET ME SOME ICE FOR MY KNEE?
SURE.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.449
(all imitate whip cracking)

01:58.449 --> 02:00.521
JULES,
WHAT THE FUDGENSTEIN?

02:00.521 --> 02:03.854
YOU ASKED ME TO BRING YOU COFFEE
BUT YOU BOUGHT ONE ANYWAY?

02:03.854 --> 02:06.857
SORRY. I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF THEY'D WRITE MY PIMP NAME

02:06.857 --> 02:10.331
ON THE CUP. ONE SOY LATTE
FOR LADY J. LOVE EXPLOSION.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.533
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.705
MAYBE TRAV WILL
JUST SKIP THE RING

02:14.705 --> 02:17.808
AND PUT A BABY IN KIRSTEN.
THAT'S WHAT JELLY BEAN WOULD DO.

02:17.808 --> 02:21.512
I TOTALLY WOULD.
MY LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER
WITH YOU IN IT.

02:21.512 --> 02:24.415
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I'LL JUST
GIVE THIS COFFEE TO BOBBY.

02:24.415 --> 02:26.817
NAH, HE'S GONNA BE LATE.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

02:26.817 --> 02:29.420
TO SHOWER WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE A SHOWER?

02:29.420 --> 02:31.782
SIR.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT HERE.

02:31.782 --> 02:34.725
UNDERSTOOD, MY FRIEND, BUT YOU
CAN'T KEEP ME FROM RINSING.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.461
(grunts)

02:40.461 --> 02:42.433
FREEDOM!

02:42.433 --> 02:46.166
BOBBY'S LATE. YOU WASTE
MY TIME BRINGING YOU COFFEE?

02:46.166 --> 02:49.270
I'M SICK OF THIS GROUP
TAKING EACH OTHER FOR GRANTED.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.273
YOU KNOW, IT IS TIME FOR SOME
JUSTICE, FOSTER HOME-STYLE,

02:52.273 --> 02:54.945
EXCEPT WITHOUT THE COAT HANGER
BRANDINGS. STARTING NOW,

02:54.945 --> 02:57.748
THE PUNISHMENT
WILL FIT THE CRIME.

02:57.748 --> 03:01.612
VENGEANCE--LOVE IT.
WHO DECIDES THE PUNISHMENT?

03:01.612 --> 03:04.615
WE'LL FORM A SACRED COUNCIL
CALLED...

03:04.615 --> 03:06.217
"THE COUNCIL."

03:06.217 --> 03:07.618
(whispers) "THE COUNCIL."

03:07.618 --> 03:09.590
ALL RIGHT,
WHO SHOULD WE GET FIRST?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.591
(all) BREAK.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.592
JULES...

03:11.592 --> 03:12.963
DAMN IT.

03:12.963 --> 03:15.566
SINCE YOU MADE ME
GET YOU COFFEE TODAY,

03:15.566 --> 03:18.469
AND YOU DID NOT TAKEONE SIP,

03:18.469 --> 03:22.503
TODAY YOU WILL BE
MY OFFICIAL SIP-GIVER.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.736
ALL RIGHT, GRAYSON, I WANT YOU
TO WATCH HOW THIS IS DONE,

03:25.736 --> 03:28.239
JUST IN CASE
I EVER LOSE MY ARMS.

03:28.239 --> 03:29.640
UGH! CAPTAIN'S PATCH

03:29.640 --> 03:32.713
HAS STILL GOT A LITTLE SAND
IN IT FROM MY SEA SHOWER.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.387
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD UPGRADE YOUR
LAND BOAT TO SOMETHING NICER.

03:36.387 --> 03:38.789
HEY, DON'T HATE ON
SIMPLE LIVING. ONE SUMMER,

03:38.789 --> 03:41.722
I SHARED A FUTON WITH MY FRIEND
OPIE. NOT IN A GAY WAY.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.754
WE SLEPT IN SHIFTS...

03:43.754 --> 03:46.427
UNLESS WE WERE REALLY COLD...

03:46.427 --> 03:48.259
OR... HOMESICK.

03:48.259 --> 03:51.262
MY HOUSE HAS A LIVING ROOM
BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE SUMO MATCHES,

03:51.262 --> 03:53.404
EVEN THOUGH
SOMEONE NEVER LETS ME.

03:53.404 --> 03:56.507
BUT STILL SOMETIMES I MISS
MY DINKY, LITTLE APARTMENT.

03:56.507 --> 03:58.909
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
MEN AND WOMEN. ONCE A WOMAN

03:58.909 --> 04:02.773
GETS A TASTE OF THE FANCY LIFE,
SHE CAN NEVER GO BACK.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS BULL?

04:02.773 --> 04:04.915
NO!
IT'S CRAZY!

04:04.915 --> 04:06.777
BECAUSE IT'S NOT!

04:06.777 --> 04:08.819
IT'S TOTALLY TRUE!

04:08.819 --> 04:11.422
SPEAK FOR YOURSELVES.
OUR FIRST PLACE SUCKED.

04:11.422 --> 04:14.425
WE HAD NO FURNITURE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

04:14.425 --> 04:17.458
SIT ON A MILK CRATE EVERY DAY?
YOU GET PERMANENT WAFFLE BUTT.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.331
WELL, IT'S GONE NOW.

04:20.331 --> 04:21.662
WELL, THEN IT'S NOT PERMANENT.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.835
THE POINT IS...I COULD
EASILY GO BACK TO THAT LIFE.

04:24.835 --> 04:26.597
YOU HAVE $60 EYE CREAM.

04:26.597 --> 04:28.869
YOU USE FOUR TOWELS
EVERY SHOWER.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.741
FACE, BODY, HAIR, FEET.

04:30.741 --> 04:33.874
YOU THINK YOU CAN
GIVE ALL THAT UP?
TOTALLY.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.476
PROVE IT.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.479
YOU STAY HERE ON BOBBY'S BOAT.
HE STAYS AT YOUR HOUSE.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.951
OOH, HOW LONG?
SIX MONTHS? A YEAR?
A WEEKEND.

04:40.951 --> 04:43.484
I'M STILL IN.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.985
I CAN SO DO THIS.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.318
BESIDES, IT'LL KEEP
MY MIND OFF TRAV.

04:47.318 --> 04:50.321
IT'LL ALSO KEEP YOU HIDDEN UNTIL
YOU CAN WEAR HIGH HEELS AGAIN.

04:50.321 --> 04:52.323
'CAUSE WHEN YOU WEAR FLATS,

04:52.323 --> 04:55.896
YOU'RE SO TEENY-TINY, I'M AFRAID
SOMEONE'S GONNA STEP ON YOU.
(laughter)

04:55.896 --> 04:59.029
COUNCIL.

04:59.029 --> 05:00.501
WHAT?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.373
HOW MANY BOTTLES OF CHAMP?

05:02.373 --> 05:03.674
(Kevin) PINEAPPLE...

05:03.674 --> 05:05.506
(chair scrapes floor)

05:05.506 --> 05:07.838
SO, BUDDY... HOW'S IT GOING?

05:07.838 --> 05:09.840
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:09.840 --> 05:12.783
I'M TAKING AN INTEREST IN YOU.
I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER. I...

05:12.783 --> 05:14.745
MOM STRIKES AGAIN.

05:14.745 --> 05:17.648
OOH. (babbles)

05:17.648 --> 05:19.690
"STRAWBERRIES,
CHAMPAGNE, BLANKET...

05:19.690 --> 05:23.454
(singsongy) RING."OOH,
I KNEW IT. YOU'RE PROPOSING.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.456
NO. THIS IS A LIST OF...

05:25.456 --> 05:29.660
PROPS
FOR KEVIN'S NEW MUSIC VIDEO.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.001
HOW'S THAT SONG GO?

05:31.001 --> 05:32.603
(off-key) в™Є GIRL в™Є

05:32.603 --> 05:35.506
в™Є I GOT STUFF FOR YOU в™Є

05:35.506 --> 05:38.509
RIGHT. I GOT TO CALL YOUR MOM.
EVERY MOMENT I SIT

05:38.509 --> 05:41.872
ON THIS INFORMATION AND DON'T
TELL HER, I AM IN DANGER.

05:41.872 --> 05:46.346
NO. KEV, IF HE MOVES, TAKE HIM
DOWN. HE'S FASTER THAN HE LOOKS.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.380
ALL-STATE LINEBACKER,
THEY USED TO CALL HIM "PANCAKE."

05:49.380 --> 05:53.524
(chair scraping floor)

05:57.388 --> 05:59.390
(grunts)

05:59.390 --> 06:01.061
YOU JUST GOT PANCAKED!

06:01.061 --> 06:02.393
(groans)

06:02.393 --> 06:05.466
WHY IS THIS MY PUNISHMENT?

06:05.466 --> 06:08.839
YOU ALWAYS ACT LIKE YOU'RE
ABOVE US. NOW YOU ARE.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.541
ALL RIGHT, J-BIRD,

06:10.541 --> 06:14.004
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE,
I GOT TO SHOW YOU THE ROPES.

06:14.004 --> 06:16.407
AND THESE ARE ROPES.
NO, DON'T TOUCH.

06:16.407 --> 06:18.879
THEY HOLD THE BOAT STEADY,
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.
OH.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.682
NOW YOU GOT TO
WATCH OUT FOR SHARK.
SHARKS?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.955
SHARK.HE'S A HOMELESS DUDE WHO
PUSHES A SHOPPING CART AROUND

06:24.955 --> 06:27.488
WITH A SURFBOARD HANGING
OUT THE BACK. WHEN HE SHOWS,

06:27.488 --> 06:31.161
I WANT YOU TO THROW HIM SOME
FOOD OR ELSE HE GETS AGGRESSIVE.

06:31.161 --> 06:35.165
UH, ELECTRICITY. NOW... NOW
REMEMBER, SPARK GOOD, FIRE BAD.

06:35.165 --> 06:37.728
THAT LITTLE RHYME
MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.830
NOT A RHYME.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.001
UH...

06:41.001 --> 06:43.133
THE TOILET'S BROKE,

06:43.133 --> 06:46.537
DOG TRAVIS COMES AND GOES,
AND... OH.

06:46.537 --> 06:49.079
HERE YOU GO. NOW LIGHTING
THIS HIBACHI'S PRETTY TRICKY,

06:49.079 --> 06:52.543
BUT KEEP AT IT, 'CAUSE SHE'S
YOUR STOVEANDYOUR HEATER.

06:52.543 --> 06:53.744
OH.

06:53.744 --> 06:55.946
AND... HERE'S YOUR TOWEL.

06:55.946 --> 06:58.549
OH. FOR THE DISHES
OR MY BODY?

06:58.549 --> 07:00.120
THAT'S YOUR EVERYTHING TOWEL.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.092
YOU HAVE A CHILD
WITH THAT MAN!

07:02.092 --> 07:04.995
FIVE MORE MINUTES!
WHAT IF I NEED EXTRA SUPPLIES?

07:04.995 --> 07:07.928
YOU KNOW? LIKE ANOTHER
EVERYTHING TOWEL.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.531
(chuckles) YOU'RE ON
A BOBBY BUDGET, SWEETHEART.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.933
20 BUCKS
FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.766
WOW. BETTER MAKE IT COUNT.

07:15.766 --> 07:18.208
OKAY, I'M TAPPED OUT.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.170
PLEASE, LET ME GO HOME.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.843
NOPE.

07:22.843 --> 07:27.778
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:34.184 --> 07:37.157
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO JOIN ME HERE ON THE BOAT?

07:37.157 --> 07:41.632
MM? IT'S PRETTY SEXY.
JUST ME, VASE FULL OF WINE,

07:41.632 --> 07:45.636
AND A SMELLY, WET BEAR
THAT JUST PUKED UP A FLIP-FLOP.

07:45.636 --> 07:49.069
HUGE PASS.
UM... SAY, JULES...

07:49.069 --> 07:50.100
(grunts)

07:50.100 --> 07:52.773
UH, FORGET IT. I SHOULD GO.
(beep)

07:52.773 --> 07:55.806
LOOK, IF SHE KNEW I WAS
PROPOSING THIS WEEKEND,

07:55.806 --> 07:59.650
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE COULD RESIST BUTTING IN?
I TRULY DO.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.712
WOW, YOU'RE A GOOD LIAR.

08:01.712 --> 08:04.955
THANKS. THAT'S HOW
I BAGGED YOUR MOM.
SWEET.

08:04.955 --> 08:08.258
YOU'RE ONLY 19.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HER TO DO?

08:08.258 --> 08:11.692
THIS ISN'T SOME CHILDISH MOVE
TO KEEP KIRSTEN HERE.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.163
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

08:13.163 --> 08:17.497
IT'S REAL. TELL HIM, KEV.
SO REAL.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.500
I CAN'T STOP YOU FROM TELLING MY
MOM. HONESTLY, I DIDN'T EXPECT

08:20.500 --> 08:24.504
YOU TO HAVE MY BACK ANYWAY,
SO YOU DO WHAT YOU GO TO DO.
(thud)

08:24.504 --> 08:28.839
YOU'RE VERY GOOD
AT BEING MANIPULATIVE.

08:28.839 --> 08:30.110
THANKS, MAN.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.643
в™Є LOVE DID THIS в™Є

08:32.643 --> 08:34.615
THAT'S A NEW SONG.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.618
WAIT. WHY DO WE HAVE TO
HAVE COFFEE OVER HERE?

08:37.618 --> 08:40.621
'CAUSE WHEREVER I AM
IS WHERE WE HAVE COFFEE.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.654
WELL, THIS IS HORRIBLE.

08:45.696 --> 08:47.698
STILL HORRIBLE.

08:47.698 --> 08:50.260
MY COFFEE TASTES
LIKE A MARTINI.

08:50.260 --> 08:53.704
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE DRINKING
OUT OF AN OLIVE JAR.

08:53.704 --> 08:55.105
DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANY COMPLAINTS

08:55.105 --> 08:57.708
THEY'D LIKE TO BRING
BEFORE THE COUNCIL?

08:57.708 --> 09:00.741
THAT DEPENDS. I TREATED BOBBY'S
HOME WITH RESPECT LAST NIGHT.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.743
DID HE TREAT MINE THE SAME?

09:02.743 --> 09:06.146
(both grunting)

09:08.548 --> 09:12.252
NOT MY GOOD TOWELS! PLEASE
TELL ME YOUR WORE UNDERWEAR.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.655
OKAY. WE WORE UNDERWEAR.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.126
(both laugh)

09:16.126 --> 09:18.188
(Laurie, Grayson, and Jules)
COUNCIL!

09:18.188 --> 09:20.791
HEY, WE GO DOWN,
WE GO DOWN TOGETHER.
WORD.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.694
ANDY, YOU'RE ABSOLVED BECAUSE
YOU'RE EASILY INFLUENCED.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.565
HOW DO WE PUNISH HIM?

09:25.565 --> 09:26.697
WHAT?

09:26.697 --> 09:28.098
(all) OKAY... READY....

09:28.098 --> 09:32.142
OH, BOY. BOBBY, YOU ARE GOING
TO HATE YOUR PUNISHMENT.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.705
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA
TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.

09:34.705 --> 09:35.946
HOW WILL I KNOW?

09:35.946 --> 09:39.209
OH, YOU'LL KNOW.
(cackles)

09:39.209 --> 09:42.012
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HIS PUNISHMENT IS.

09:42.012 --> 09:43.814
THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT.

09:43.814 --> 09:47.187
BOBBY NEVER THINKS ABOUT
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.590
NOW HE'S GONNA WORRY ABOUT
THE CONSEQUENCES ALL DAY.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.824
THAT'S THE GENIUS OF
THE NO-PUNISHMENT PUNISHMENT.

09:53.824 --> 09:56.867
WILL YOU EXPLAIN IT
TO ME LATER?

09:56.867 --> 10:01.071
NO, IT'LL TAKE TOO LONG. SO, UH,
HOW'S, UH, BOAT LIVING GOING?

10:01.071 --> 10:04.274
WELL, MY HAIR'S HOLDING UP.
BUT NO MOISTURIZER.

10:04.274 --> 10:07.277
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ALWAYS
WEAR TOO MUCH UNDER YOUR EYES.

10:07.277 --> 10:10.210
I DON'T--
THERE YOU GO. WELL,
THAT'S THE STUFF. OH, YEAH.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.742
THIS IS EASY.

10:11.742 --> 10:15.185
WELL, IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE NIGHT,
AND WINE GOT YOU THROUGH IT.

10:15.185 --> 10:18.318
WELL, I HAVE WHOLE OTHER BOTT--
OH. HALF A BOTTLE. OH, WELL.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.221
NO BIGGIE.
COBBS CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.724
(door squeaks)
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT'S MY PUNISHMENT?

10:23.724 --> 10:26.997
в™Єв™Єв™Є

10:30.030 --> 10:32.903
(man) в™Є I WAKE UP в™Є

10:32.903 --> 10:35.906
в™Є AND MY FEET
DON'T TOUCH THE GROUND в™Є

10:35.906 --> 10:39.209
в™Є I LOOK OUT в™Є

10:39.209 --> 10:43.213
в™Є TO THE MESS
THAT'S ALL AROUND в™Є

10:43.213 --> 10:45.876
в™Є AND I'M BRUISED FROM в™Є

10:45.876 --> 10:50.781
в™Є ALL THIS CONFUSION в™Є

10:50.781 --> 10:52.783
в™Є DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT в™Є

10:52.783 --> 10:55.025
(gasps) OH, GOD.

10:55.025 --> 10:57.027
в™Є LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE, YEAH в™Є

10:57.027 --> 10:59.429
в™Є 'CAUSE EVERYTHING, ANYTHING,
EVERYTHING IS NEVER ENOUGH в™Є

10:59.429 --> 11:02.793
(lowered voice) HEY, UH,
WHO SHOULD I TAKE THIS RING TO?

11:02.793 --> 11:05.665
I WANT TO GET IT SIZED
BEFORE I PROPOSE.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.067
I'LL DO IT.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.070
YEAH, I USED TO SELL JEWELRY
ON THE STREET IN SOUTH BEACH.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.203
MM-HMM. PLEASE, TELL ME YOU
DIDN'T ALSO MAKE THE JEWELRY.

11:13.203 --> 11:16.306
NO. THAT'S LAME.
(chuckles) I MEAN,

11:16.306 --> 11:19.309
MAYBE A FEW PIECES, A TOE RING
HERE, A BRACELET THERE.

11:19.309 --> 11:22.853
I ONCE MADE A TURQUOISE BOLO TIE
FOR LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.785
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

11:24.785 --> 11:27.017
EVEN MORE HANDSOME
IN PERSON.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.458
AWESOME.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.320
WOW.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.923
OKAY, WE GOT TO PULL
OUT OF THIS. LOOK,

11:32.923 --> 11:36.897
I'M GONNA GO CALL KEVIN. CAN YOU
TAKE KIRSTEN A SODA FOR ME?
GOTCHA.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.469
FROM TRAV.
OH, THANKS.

11:39.469 --> 11:42.332
OH, GREAT NECKLACE. WHOEVER MADE
IT IS VERY TALENTED.

11:42.332 --> 11:46.336
AW, THANKS. I'M SURE SHE
OR HE...(chuckles) IS.

11:46.336 --> 11:49.279
SO YOU ARE, UH, TAKING OFF FOR
CHI-TOWN IN A FEW WEEKS, RIGHT?

11:49.279 --> 11:53.083
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?
FREAKING OUT,
SEXING UP TRAV A LOT...

11:53.083 --> 11:55.315
SHARING WAY TOO MUCH
WITH STRANGERS.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.949
NO NEED TO FREAK.
YOU GUYS ARE A GREAT COUPLE.
SO HARD TO LEAVE.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.951
BUT HE'S GOT HIS LIFE HERE,

12:00.951 --> 12:02.853
YOU KNOW, FINISHING COLLEGE,
AND...

12:02.853 --> 12:05.856
I LOVE HIM, BUT...
I THINK I'M READY TO START

12:05.856 --> 12:09.259
MY LIFE THERE, TOO, YOU KNOW?
IT'S COMPLICATED. IT'S...

12:09.259 --> 12:11.932
SORRY. I'M DOING IT AGAIN.
I'M SHARING TOO MUCH.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.505
NO, NO. NO, IT'S FINE.

12:15.505 --> 12:19.069
I HAVE BEEN SITTING OUTSIDE
IN A HOT CAR FOR 15 MINUTES!

12:19.069 --> 12:21.842
YOU SAID YOU WERE
COMING RIGHT OUT!

12:21.842 --> 12:24.845
SORRY, HON. I WAS, UH, LOOKING
FOR THE KEYS. UH, I FOUND--

12:24.845 --> 12:26.476
(gasps) PLEASE DON'T
TELL THE COUNCIL.

12:26.476 --> 12:29.419
OH, PLEASE, DON'T TELL
THE COUNCIL. (chuckles) PLEASE?

12:29.419 --> 12:32.752
ONE HOUR
SITTING IN A HOT CAR.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.827
I DON'T CARE. I'M CUBAN.
WE EAT HEAT FOR BREAKFAST.

12:36.827 --> 12:39.960
ENJOY.

12:39.960 --> 12:44.234
WHEN THE HELL IS MY PUNISHMENT
COMING? I CAN'T SLEEP.

12:44.234 --> 12:45.966
SOON, VERY SOON.

12:45.966 --> 12:49.239
WELL, HELLO, BRIDE OF UNABOMBER.
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

12:49.239 --> 12:51.842
I JUST CAME BY TO GRAB
A FEW ESSENTIALS--

12:51.842 --> 12:54.244
YOU KNOW, SOME TOWELS,
CUTICLE CREAM,

12:54.244 --> 12:57.377
MAYBE ONE TINY WHEEL OF BRIE,
AND A CASE OF WINE.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.279
AH, RULES ARE RULES.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.311
OH, COME ON,
JUST ONE QUICK SHOWER.

13:01.311 --> 13:05.055
MY HAIR IS SO GREASY,
AND MY SKIN IS SO DRY!

13:05.055 --> 13:07.317
WHY WON'T THEY BALANCE OUT?

13:07.317 --> 13:09.559
SORRY, HONEY.
NO CAN DO.

13:09.559 --> 13:12.262
(babbles in mocking voice)
(tires screech)

13:12.262 --> 13:14.264
(muffled voice) GET ME
OUTTA HERE! IT'S SO HOT!

13:14.264 --> 13:19.870
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE! OKAY!
I'M SORRY! DON'T GO! DON'T GO!

13:19.870 --> 13:21.531
(chuckles) HEY, WHAT'S UP?

13:21.531 --> 13:24.134
JUST, UH,
CAME TO GRAB THE RING.

13:24.134 --> 13:27.437
OH, YEAH. ABOUT THAT, I LOST IT.
(chuckles) SORRY.

13:27.437 --> 13:30.040
DUDE, IT'S RIGHT THERE
IN YOUR POCKET.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.282
OHH, STUPID TIGHT T-SHIRT.

13:32.282 --> 13:35.115
LOOK,
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE RING.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.447
GRAB HIM.
HE'S GONE GOLLUM ON US.

13:37.447 --> 13:39.119
(groans) OH! OH!

13:39.119 --> 13:40.220
PANCAKE.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.523
(groans)
DUDE, SHE'S GONNA SAY NO.

13:46.056 --> 13:47.427
(click)

13:48.999 --> 13:50.400
(click)
DAMN IT!

13:53.033 --> 13:54.404
(beep)

13:54.404 --> 13:56.937
(John Williams'
"Theme from 'Jaws'" playing)
ELLIE, PICK UP.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.339
IT'S COLD! THE ONLY THING
THAT'S KEEPING ME ALIVE

13:59.339 --> 14:01.942
IS THIS LITTLE BIT OF WINE
THAT I'M SAVING.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.874
COME ON. PLEASE, COME GET ME.

14:03.874 --> 14:05.245
(clatter)
HELLO?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.247
(lowered voice) ELLIE, SHARK!

14:07.247 --> 14:10.150
(normal voice)
I DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD!

14:10.150 --> 14:14.224
(thudding and rumbling)

14:14.224 --> 14:16.586
I'M GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT.

14:18.388 --> 14:20.290
COME ON!

14:22.262 --> 14:23.293
NO!

14:23.293 --> 14:24.434
NO.

14:24.434 --> 14:27.097
NO. NO. NO, NO, NO.

14:27.097 --> 14:29.399
(gasping)

14:29.399 --> 14:31.401
NO. (crying)

14:31.401 --> 14:34.574
в™Єв™Єв™Є

14:41.081 --> 14:43.283
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:43.283 --> 14:46.016
I FOUGHT A BUM FOR WINE,
AND I LOST.

14:46.016 --> 14:49.189
DIDN'T YOUR MOM TEACH YOU?
BUMS ALWAYS WIN WINE FIGHTS.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.621
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE COMING TO TAKE ME HOME.

14:51.621 --> 14:55.125
I MISS MY UNDERWEAR DRAWER.
IT SMELLS LIKE LILACS.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.527
ANDY IS SO EXCITED
FOR YOU TO FAIL,

14:57.527 --> 15:00.170
THAT HE AND I
MADE A SIDE BET.

15:00.170 --> 15:03.173
IF YOU LOSE, I HAVE TO START
CALLING STAN BY HIS MIDDLE NAME.

15:03.173 --> 15:06.576
I CAN'T SAY, "I LOVE YOU,
HECTOR." IT'S NOT IN ME.

15:06.576 --> 15:08.308
YOU BET ON ME?

15:08.308 --> 15:09.909
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.613
AND I WAS HAMMERED.

15:13.613 --> 15:17.287
GIVE ME THAT GOLF CLUB.

15:17.287 --> 15:21.992
ALL RIGHT. I CAN DO THIS.
IT'S TIME TO SACK UP.

15:21.992 --> 15:24.654
THAT'S FOR BOYS.
IT'S TIME TO UTERUS UP.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.961
(flames whoosh, clatter)

15:30.961 --> 15:33.263
(deep voice) YEAH!

15:33.263 --> 15:36.206
I... HAVE MADE FIRE!

15:36.206 --> 15:38.368
I... HAVE MADE...

15:38.368 --> 15:39.970
FIRE!

15:39.970 --> 15:41.972
(sighs)
THE WAY SHE WAS TALKING,

15:41.972 --> 15:45.375
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.378
FINE, MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO START HER LIFE OVER

15:48.378 --> 15:51.181
FOR A BOYFRIEND, BUT GETTING
MARRIED IS DIFFERENT.

15:51.181 --> 15:52.652
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.655
I WANT TO. I ALSO WANT
TO BELIEVE MY HAIRCUT DOESN'T

15:55.655 --> 15:59.659
MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THE MAYOR
OF A SMALL MEXICAN TOWN.
YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.992
(chuckles) YEAH.
I WAS KIDDING.

16:01.992 --> 16:03.994
MM. LOOK, IF I DON'T ASK,

16:03.994 --> 16:06.696
I'LL JUST ALWAYS WONDER
WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE SAID.

16:06.696 --> 16:10.170
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

16:10.170 --> 16:13.273
YEAH, I'D WANT TO KNOW, TOO.

16:18.108 --> 16:23.013
I'M DYING HERE. IS ANYONE
GONNA TELL ME MY PUNISHMENT?

16:23.013 --> 16:25.315
CAN'T.
WISH I COULD, DUDE.

16:25.315 --> 16:27.317
(Laurie) MNH-MNH.
FEELS WEIRD DRINKING COFFEE
WITHOUT JULES.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.119
IT'S LIKE SHE'S DEAD.

16:29.119 --> 16:31.291
OH, YEAH. IT IS.
YEAH. IT IS. IT IS, YEAH.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.692
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST

16:32.692 --> 16:35.325
I CAN EAT CREAM CHEESE
RIGHT OFF THE SPOON. MMM!

16:35.325 --> 16:37.327
(mouth full)
I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE A LIE

16:37.327 --> 16:40.270
SPREAD IT ALL OVER THE BAGEL,
THEN LICK IT OFF,

16:40.270 --> 16:45.575
AND THEN CHUCK THE BAGEL AWAY.
I'M SO TELLING JULES THAT YOU'RE
A SPOON-LICKIN' BAGEL-WASTER.

16:45.575 --> 16:47.307
THAT'S TATTLING.
COUNCIL WARNING.

16:47.307 --> 16:51.381
THERE ARE NO COUNCIL WARNINGS.
COUNCIL, FOR MAKING STUFF UP.

16:51.381 --> 16:54.444
YOU CAN'T CALL A COUNCIL
FOR MAKING STUFF UP.
YOU JUST MADE THAT UP.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.446
COUNCIL FOR BEING
INTENTIONAL POT-STIRRER.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.188
COUNCIL FOR GIBBERISH!

16:58.188 --> 17:03.453
ENOUGH! THE NEXT PERSON
TO CALL COUNCIL GETS A COUNCIL.

17:03.453 --> 17:04.654
COUNCIL.

17:04.654 --> 17:08.258
(sputters) NO.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.330
I WONDER HOW JULES IS DOING.

17:12.402 --> 17:17.467
OH, GOOD, YOU WENT SWIMMING.
MAMA'S HOT. DOG SHOWER.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.769
(laughs) I LOVE IT.

17:19.769 --> 17:21.471
WHOA, OKAY!
(clatter)

17:21.471 --> 17:24.414
OH! HEY, SHARK!
HERE YOU GO, BUDDY!

17:24.414 --> 17:25.745
(clatter)
OW!

17:25.745 --> 17:29.579
WHY ARE YOU
THROWING CANS AT ME?

17:29.579 --> 17:31.581
IT'S CHILLY OUT
TONIGHT, HUH?

17:31.581 --> 17:34.154
COME ON. YOU DIDN'T THINK
I'D PLAN A SPECIAL NIGHT

17:34.154 --> 17:36.456
WITHOUT SHOWING UP EARLY
TO START THE FIRE.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.628
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT TONIGHT?

17:38.628 --> 17:41.060
I DON'T KNOW.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.832
YOU'RE HERE.

17:46.236 --> 17:47.797
I'M BORED.

17:47.797 --> 17:49.399
WOULD YOU CHILL?

17:49.399 --> 17:51.801
YOU WANT TO CATCH CRABS,
YOU GOT TO BE PATIENT.

17:51.801 --> 17:53.403
OR UNLUCKY.

17:53.403 --> 17:55.505
(both chuckle)

17:55.505 --> 17:58.248
LET'S GO BACK TO THE BOAT.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.310
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

18:00.310 --> 18:05.215
UH, THOUGHT I SAW A DOLPHIN
EAT A BIRD, OVER...

18:05.215 --> 18:10.490
HEY. IS THAT TRAVIS?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.522
WAIT. WE HAVE TO STOP HIM!

18:12.522 --> 18:16.226
OKAY--NO, NO, NO, NO. JUMP ON
MY BACK. I'LL TAKE YOU. OW!

18:16.226 --> 18:19.229
WHY ARE YOU GOING THIS WAY?!
LOOK, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO STAY OUT OF IT.

18:19.229 --> 18:21.231
THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.773
YOU KNEW?!
GET ME OVER THERE NOW! NOW!

18:23.773 --> 18:27.707
(lowered voice) OW! QUIT
HITTING ME AND JUST WATCH. SHH.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.140
(speaks inaudibly)

18:30.140 --> 18:32.742
PLEASE SAY YES.

18:32.742 --> 18:35.745
(The National's "About Today"
playing)

18:39.649 --> 18:42.622
в™Є DIDN'T ASK YOU WHY в™Є

18:46.856 --> 18:49.329
(singsongy)
OOH! COUNCIL IN THE HIZZY!

18:49.329 --> 18:53.203
(normal voice) WHO ARE WE ABOUT
TO BITCH-SLAP WITH SOME JUSTICE?

18:53.203 --> 18:55.535
LAURIE...
NO! WHAT DID I DO?

18:55.535 --> 18:58.668
YOUR COUNCIL THING
MESSED UP OUR GROUP.
YEAH, WE USED TO FEEL
SAFE WITH EACH OTHER.

18:58.668 --> 19:01.341
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE--PEOPLE
YOU CAN CONSTANTLY CRAP ON,

19:01.341 --> 19:03.343
AND YOU MADE
THAT A BAD THING.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.875
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE CRIME,
JELLY BEAN,

19:05.875 --> 19:09.249
AND FOR THAT, YOU WILL RECEIVE
THE ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.881
MEET... LITTLE RICHARD.

19:11.881 --> 19:13.483
в™Є WHOO в™Є
STOP DOING THAT.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.485
STOP SAYING,
"LITTLE RICHARD."
в™Є WHOO в™Є

19:15.485 --> 19:20.330
WHATEVER. IT'S FINE.
I'VE DONE WINE SHOOTERS BEFORE.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.332
YES, BUT THE THING IS,

19:22.332 --> 19:25.335
YOU DON'T GET A REFILL
UNTIL WE NEED A REFILL.

19:25.335 --> 19:26.336
(slurps)

19:26.336 --> 19:27.897
(smacks lips)

19:27.897 --> 19:31.271
FINE. WELL, I'LL JUST
HAVE TO MAKE IT LAST.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.602
(sips)

19:32.602 --> 19:37.607
NO! IT'S GONE ALREADY?
DAMN YOU, LITTLE RICHARD!

19:37.607 --> 19:38.608
в™Є WHOO в™Є

19:38.608 --> 19:40.210
(chuckles)

19:40.210 --> 19:41.611
в™Є HEY в™Є

19:43.613 --> 19:45.655
THAT WAS FUN.

19:45.655 --> 19:47.617
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

19:47.617 --> 19:48.758
NO.

19:48.758 --> 19:50.290
I CAN GO.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.823
YOU CAN STAY.
JUST NO TALKING.

19:53.823 --> 19:56.266
(cell phone alert chimes)

19:56.266 --> 19:59.399
HEY. IT'S OVER. I WON.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.702
I SURVIVED THE BOAT.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.935
SEE, TRAV? US COBBS
CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING.

20:05.935 --> 20:08.538
ARE YOU REALLY COMPARING
SPENDING TWO NIGHTS

20:08.538 --> 20:11.411
ON DAD'S BOAT
TO THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE?

20:11.411 --> 20:12.812
I WAS TRYING TO.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.785

AS MUCH AS I LOVE HER.

TO SAY NO, SO...
