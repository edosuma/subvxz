WEBVTT

00:00.781 --> 00:03.493
All right. Big Day. Michael,
how's the musical coming?

00:03.503 --> 00:05.501
Dean Pasquesi said it needs
a better opening line.

00:05.511 --> 00:06.810
Currently it's just exposition.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.640
I need $2 million in pyrotechnics.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.409
But that's the least of my problems.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.044
I have to give a speech opening night.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.913
And I'm not even getting an award!

00:14.923 --> 00:16.233
But you love talking to people.

00:16.242 --> 00:18.378
You spent ten minutes berating
that man on the subway

00:18.388 --> 00:19.741
for wearing pleated pants.

00:19.751 --> 00:21.376
That was an emergency.

00:21.386 --> 00:23.378
Plus, now I have time to think
and I'm in my head.

00:23.388 --> 00:25.380
Do I thank my friends
or do I gloat to my enemies?

00:25.390 --> 00:27.549
Do I wear a polka-dot ribbon
for acne awareness?

00:27.559 --> 00:29.618
Relax. I got a great ches book.

00:29.628 --> 00:31.186
A little "Four score,"

00:31.196 --> 00:33.355
a little "I'ma let you finish,"
you good.

00:33.365 --> 00:36.124
So, Matthew, you ready to give the
staff their performance reviews?

00:36.134 --> 00:38.460
Oh, yeah. I just hope I'm tough enough.

00:38.470 --> 00:40.629
It hurts to furrow my brow.
You really can't help?

00:40.639 --> 00:42.564
No, I'm busy
trying to hire a new trainer.

00:42.574 --> 00:44.633
Hey it's 7:00. We gotta go, go, go.

00:47.646 --> 00:49.471
Your Postmates is here.

00:49.481 --> 00:51.406
You guys aren't busy, right?

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:05.330 --> 01:07.055
- Mom.

01:07.065 --> 01:08.490
- Hi.
- Oh my gosh.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.259
What are you doing here?

01:10.269 --> 01:12.261
Like I would miss your big premiere.

01:12.271 --> 01:14.396
Also, the "cozy" Airbnb I booked,

01:14.406 --> 01:16.498
turned out to be
a toilet at Port Authority.

01:16.508 --> 01:17.833
But I'm gonna stay here. Ah!

01:17.843 --> 01:19.134
- What?
- Yay!

01:19.144 --> 01:20.502
Uh, stay here?

01:20.512 --> 01:22.571
We already use
our dish washer as a closet.

01:22.581 --> 01:24.239
Also we don't want to mess with.

01:24.249 --> 01:26.343
Michael's sleep schedule
this close to opening night.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.739
Yeah, without his 14 hours, he won't

01:27.750 --> 01:29.637
have the energy he needs
to scream at his cast.

01:29.648 --> 01:31.179
But I haven't seen my mom in so long.

01:31.189 --> 01:33.849
There have been four new cities of
housewives since I last saw her.

01:33.859 --> 01:35.183
Aleppo is lit.

01:35.193 --> 01:36.485
Yeah, plus, you know,

01:36.495 --> 01:38.186
it'd be really good for us to catch up.

01:38.196 --> 01:39.588
- Ooh.
- Maybe discuss Michael.

01:39.598 --> 01:41.415
And you guys could tell me
all the nice things

01:41.426 --> 01:43.580
- you say about me behind my back.
- Okay, fine.

01:43.591 --> 01:45.072
But we got a lot going on around here.

01:45.083 --> 01:46.702
So, at least try
and stay out of the way.

01:46.713 --> 01:49.531
Of course. I will be a ghost.
You will never notice I'm here.

01:49.548 --> 01:50.837
Matthew, I need you to wash
all the clothes

01:50.848 --> 01:52.301
in my suitcase 'cause they're dirty.

01:52.311 --> 01:54.836
- Ah! I get to show you my room.
- Please.

01:54.846 --> 01:58.540
So, Leora, can I get you anything?

01:58.550 --> 02:00.275
Coffee? Water?

02:00.285 --> 02:02.444
Maybe some personal space?

02:02.454 --> 02:03.779
You'd primarily be helping me

02:03.789 --> 02:06.682
with my Cardi B cardio class load.

02:06.692 --> 02:09.550
How do you handle taking
directions from a woman?

02:09.561 --> 02:10.786
I am a woman.

02:10.795 --> 02:12.621
Not well.

02:12.631 --> 02:15.324
Excuse me.

02:15.334 --> 02:17.057
<i>Hey, I'm picking up Michael from school.</i>

02:17.068 --> 02:18.360
<i>Your apartment's boring.</i>

02:18.370 --> 02:20.195
So, did you want to talk about my resume

02:20.205 --> 02:21.530
or my qualifications?

02:21.540 --> 02:23.799
Uh, yeah, mm-hmm, totally. Yep, sorry.

02:23.809 --> 02:25.500
<i>That's surprisingly helpful.</i>

02:25.510 --> 02:27.302
<i>Make him write his opening night speech.</i>

02:27.312 --> 02:28.804
I got a question.

02:28.814 --> 02:30.472
You're not one of them snobby.

02:30.482 --> 02:32.708
NPR-types that's gonna get offended if

02:32.718 --> 02:35.711
I call you by the wrong name
or back into your car?

02:35.721 --> 02:37.646
Oh, I actually walk to work.

02:37.656 --> 02:40.148
It's part of my commitment
to fitness and the environment.

02:42.327 --> 02:45.187
No. We're going to a cat cafÃ©
where everyone is mean to you.

02:45.197 --> 02:47.756
Michael says you never let him
<i>do anything spontaneous.</i>

02:47.766 --> 02:50.392
<i>Because there is a time
and place for spontaneity.</i>

02:53.805 --> 02:55.764
Don't take it personally.

02:55.774 --> 02:58.834
He's that rude to everybody,
but you learn to tune it out.

03:00.679 --> 03:02.571
So, Ms. McClure, are you ready

03:02.581 --> 03:04.172
for your performance review?

03:04.182 --> 03:07.509
Yes, but maybe you
should get a second opinion

03:07.519 --> 03:09.244
from Sacagawea.

03:09.254 --> 03:10.679
Are you kidding?

03:10.689 --> 03:12.514
- Am I?
- I asked Vince for this.

03:12.524 --> 03:14.583
I have to prove I can handle it.

03:14.593 --> 03:16.485
Now, your performance review.

03:16.495 --> 03:18.887
LeAnn Rimes said it best when she sang,

03:18.897 --> 03:20.822
"How can I breathe without you?"

03:20.832 --> 03:22.190
Nice work.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.259
Wow. That was soft.

03:24.269 --> 03:25.494
Even for you.

03:25.504 --> 03:26.661
You don't care

03:26.671 --> 03:28.597
that I took off all of Shark Week?

03:28.607 --> 03:30.665
Or that I unclogged
the toilet with firecrackers?

03:30.675 --> 03:33.335
Or that she caused the clog
by trying to flush away

03:33.345 --> 03:34.436
a bunch of parking tickets.

03:34.446 --> 03:36.171
Be quiet, Dana.

03:36.181 --> 03:38.173
Only Matthew
and the panel of The X-Factor

03:38.183 --> 03:40.342
are allowed to judge me.

03:40.352 --> 03:41.943
- Forget it.
- Wait, let me try it again.

03:41.953 --> 03:44.513
I have stickers.

03:44.523 --> 03:46.748
Well, you just ruined my first
performance review, Dana.

03:46.758 --> 03:48.350
Congratulations, and will you please

03:48.360 --> 03:49.951
stop clacking those spinster's sticks?

03:49.961 --> 03:51.251
Sorry.

03:51.262 --> 03:53.922
Ever since my breakup with Asher,
I've been deep in Scarf City.

03:53.932 --> 03:56.792
It's very therapeutic.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.865
<i>Dana's breakup is making her unbearable.</i>

04:03.875 --> 04:06.201
<i>She's spinning out more than Lady Taz.</i>

04:06.211 --> 04:07.969
<i>She's synchronized pee schedules with me</i>

04:07.979 --> 04:10.831
<i>so she can hold me hostage
for bathroom conversations.</i>

04:10.986 --> 04:13.441
She told me, "My slow cooker
<i>is my boyfriend now."</i>

04:13.452 --> 04:15.444
<i>- Skull emoji.
- Yes.</i>

04:15.454 --> 04:17.279
<i>This text chain is our one respite</i>

04:17.289 --> 04:18.880
<i>from having to deal with her.</i>

04:18.890 --> 04:20.327
<i>"Respite" means break.</i>

04:20.338 --> 04:21.382
<i>I saw it on "Jeopardy!"</i>

04:21.392 --> 04:22.901
- Who are you texting?
- Huh?

04:22.912 --> 04:24.523
Is there a secret text chain
that I don't know about?

04:24.534 --> 04:25.554
What? No.

04:25.564 --> 04:26.888
No, no, no. I'm, uh...

04:26.898 --> 04:28.723
I'm looking at pornography.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.259
Oh, baby, it is sexy.

04:31.269 --> 04:33.428
And it's sexual.

04:33.438 --> 04:34.477
Bye.

04:35.907 --> 04:40.235
Wow, so this is where the magic happens.

04:40.245 --> 04:43.305
I hope I don't trip and fall into the
arms of some beefy drama teacher.

04:43.315 --> 04:44.773
Oh, shh, shh.

04:44.783 --> 04:46.741
Gregg's coming over. How do I look?

04:46.751 --> 04:48.677
- I'm going for no-makeup makeup.
- Great.

04:48.687 --> 04:50.345
Hey, Michael. Who's this?

04:50.355 --> 04:52.347
Are you recasting the part
of "brothel madam"?

04:52.357 --> 04:53.482
She looks perfect.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.016
This is my mom, Priya.

04:55.026 --> 04:56.751
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:56.761 --> 04:58.520
Now, tell me more about
this brothel madam.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.255
She's like, hot and can still get it

05:00.265 --> 05:02.254
but just worked her way up
to management, right?

05:02.265 --> 05:04.292
Ask Michael. He's the genius.

05:04.302 --> 05:07.429
Now if only he could tell me what to
do with my arms outside of rehearsal.

05:07.439 --> 05:09.257
Gregg, you're too funny.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.365
I'm dead.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.667
Oh my God, isn't he?

05:12.677 --> 05:13.840
- He is.
- Like.

05:13.851 --> 05:15.036
- So very.
- Right?

05:15.046 --> 05:17.339
- I know.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.974
Vince and I can't talk like this.

05:18.984 --> 05:20.976
Well, I never liked him for his talking.

05:20.986 --> 05:22.377
- Eww.
- Sorry.

05:22.387 --> 05:23.686
Okay.

05:23.697 --> 05:25.043
- Go get them.
- All right, everybody.

05:25.054 --> 05:27.449
From the top! It's showtime, people!

05:27.459 --> 05:30.452
Listen to him. Listen to him.

05:30.462 --> 05:32.621
Michael. Time to work on your speech.

05:32.631 --> 05:35.357
You can't just ignore it and hope
it goes away like climate change.

05:35.367 --> 05:36.625
No, Vince.

05:36.635 --> 05:38.960
I'm actually the only one here.

05:38.970 --> 05:40.962
I was just thinking
about the good old days.

05:40.972 --> 05:44.065
You and your baseball,
me and my scoliosis.

05:44.075 --> 05:45.867
Uh-huh, yeah. Um...

05:45.877 --> 05:47.903
- Where's Matthew and Michael?
- I sent them away.

05:47.913 --> 05:50.906
Matthew is spending the night at the
Four Seasons on your credit card,

05:50.916 --> 05:52.374
and Michael is at a sleepover.

05:52.384 --> 05:53.975
A sleepover? On a school night?

05:53.985 --> 05:56.171
Hey, this isn't swinging London, baby.

05:56.182 --> 05:57.668
- He's got a speech to write.
- Okay.

05:57.679 --> 05:59.085
All right, all right. Just relax.

05:59.096 --> 06:00.847
Hey, why don't you come
sit down next to me?

06:00.858 --> 06:02.046
Come here.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.985
I thought that you and I could just...

06:03.995 --> 06:05.320
- catch up.
- Oh, yeah?

06:05.330 --> 06:07.298
Let me pour you a glass of wine.

06:09.034 --> 06:11.826
Kay... oh, God, I...

06:11.836 --> 06:14.095
can't believe the store
sold me a half-empty bottle.

06:14.105 --> 06:15.997
Look, we need to talk about Michael.

06:16.007 --> 06:17.866
Yeah, Priya, you're right.
We do need to talk.

06:17.876 --> 06:20.335
I think it's great that
you and Michael are catching up

06:20.345 --> 06:22.537
but you can't just appear out of nowhere

06:22.547 --> 06:23.838
and mess up our system.

06:23.848 --> 06:25.540
It took a lot of work.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.008
Wow. Vince,

06:27.018 --> 06:29.110
seeing you take charge
and be responsible like this,

06:29.120 --> 06:30.579
it's like you're a new man.

06:30.589 --> 06:33.582
Well, people change. You know?

06:33.592 --> 06:35.016
Eminem's political now.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.853
Why are you looking at me like that?

06:38.863 --> 06:40.722
- Like what?
- Like I'm a Kohl's gift card.

06:40.732 --> 06:42.524
Am I? Yeah, well...

06:42.534 --> 06:45.179
Guess I'm just not used to seeing
you like this. It's kind of hot.

06:45.690 --> 06:49.864
Maybe we should see what else
you're no longer terrible at.

06:54.749 --> 06:55.960
- Wait.
- Mm-hmm?

06:55.971 --> 06:56.983
- Wait.
- Yeah?

06:56.994 --> 06:58.101
- Wait one second.
- What?

06:58.112 --> 07:00.770
Before things go any further,
I need to ask you a question.

07:00.781 --> 07:02.690
I don't have protection.
I accidentally opened

07:02.701 --> 07:05.549
the last one thinking it was a Wet-Nap.
But I think we're gonna be okay.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.588
Law of averages, right?

07:06.599 --> 07:09.320
Yeah, okay, so
I just wanted to ask, um...

07:09.331 --> 07:14.326
it's okay that I take Michael back
to Ohio with me for good, right?

07:14.336 --> 07:15.360
What?

07:15.370 --> 07:16.787
No. Wait a second...

07:16.798 --> 07:19.431
Has all this kissing just been
buttering me up to ask me that?

07:19.441 --> 07:21.099
I don't know. Maybe.

07:21.109 --> 07:23.335
Look, I just didn't know
it would be this hard, okay?

07:23.345 --> 07:24.896
Or that I would miss him this much.

07:24.907 --> 07:26.247
Yeah, well it was a ton of work.

07:26.258 --> 07:27.706
But now Michael's doing great.

07:27.716 --> 07:29.521
He's getting better grades.
He's got friends.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.857
I don't have to carry him
over puddles anymore.

07:30.868 --> 07:31.922
Okay, but listen to this.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.512
A spot opened up at this
amazing art school in Cleveland.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.281
Drew Carey runs the improv program.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.682
Well, Michael loves school here.

07:37.692 --> 07:39.217
He just got into AP Hair and Makeup,

07:39.227 --> 07:40.251
as a freshman.

07:40.261 --> 07:41.286
Well, you know what?

07:41.296 --> 07:42.754
Selfishly, I miss my only son.

07:42.764 --> 07:44.341
Well, I would miss him too.

07:44.352 --> 07:46.224
So what, you just give me
a taste, get me hooked,

07:46.234 --> 07:48.460
and then just tear him away?
Who's the drug dealer now?

07:48.470 --> 07:50.395
Well, at least you have Matthew.

07:50.405 --> 07:53.531
If I died, no one would notice,
except my Roomba.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.936
I'd be covered in wheel marks
when they found my body.

07:55.947 --> 07:58.017
That's a hellafied amount
of sadness in one image.

07:58.028 --> 07:59.537
Look, I think it would be better if

07:59.547 --> 08:01.381
Michael had a parent
that he could open up to.

08:01.392 --> 08:03.732
For instance, did you know
that he has a crush on Gregg?

08:03.743 --> 08:05.377
Gregg, who plays the harp?

08:05.387 --> 08:07.145
He hates Gregg.
He said he was gag-worthy.

08:07.155 --> 08:08.747
Yeah, that's gay for good.

08:08.757 --> 08:10.448
This is a delicate age.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.931
If a young gay man doesn't
have someone to confide in,

08:12.942 --> 08:14.649
he could become
a super Christian congressman.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.888
No, Priya. The answer is no.

08:16.898 --> 08:18.256
Michael's not going anywhere.

08:18.266 --> 08:19.758
And just so you know,

08:19.768 --> 08:21.593
mashing is off the table,

08:21.603 --> 08:23.628
unless you want to do all the work!

08:26.508 --> 08:28.733
<i>Guys, forget that you're
my best friend and my brother.</i>

08:28.743 --> 08:30.902
How would you compare
me and Priya, as parents?

08:30.912 --> 08:33.772
Basically a 50-50, right?
- - Oh, it's apples and oranges.

08:33.782 --> 08:36.140
If oranges were mean
and strict and no fun at all.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.643
Yeah, dude.
Michael barely twirls anymore.

08:38.653 --> 08:40.278
Okay, but that's not all me.

08:40.288 --> 08:42.104
That's the mean streets of New York.

08:42.115 --> 08:43.131
Fine.

08:43.142 --> 08:46.568
I'm gonna prove I'm the better parent.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.003
<i>Hey, Dean Pasquesi.</i> I'm looking for
Michael. Do you know where he is?

08:50.014 --> 08:52.624
Oh, uh... do you not have
his schedule memorized?

08:52.634 --> 08:53.691
Most of our parents do.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.427
Oh, yeah. No, I do.

08:55.437 --> 08:56.594
I did.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.829
I... do not.

08:57.839 --> 09:00.698
Okay, it appears he is in play rehearsal

09:00.708 --> 09:01.833
but it's closed.

09:01.843 --> 09:03.701
No visitors.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.171
Oh, I was just gonna drop off
a little theater fuel

09:06.181 --> 09:08.640
for the cast. Hella sprinkles.

09:08.650 --> 09:10.175
Also, I'm a parent.

09:10.185 --> 09:11.476
Gotta let the parents in, right?

09:11.486 --> 09:13.478
Yes. His mother is already here.

09:13.488 --> 09:15.547
Yeah, no, I heard her
guffawing from the street.

09:15.557 --> 09:18.316
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee,
hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

09:18.326 --> 09:20.652
Uh, I'm sorry, Vince, It seems like

09:20.662 --> 09:22.687
Michael only put Priya on the list.

09:22.697 --> 09:24.222
But, if it's any consolation,

09:24.232 --> 09:25.890
children always prefer their mothers.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.692
I know I prefer mine.

09:27.702 --> 09:29.160
I see.

09:34.809 --> 09:36.334
Dana?

09:36.344 --> 09:37.635
What are you doing?

09:37.645 --> 09:39.304
Mervin our janitor cleans the ring.

09:39.314 --> 09:41.973
Or did he quit because you bored
him to death about your breakup?

09:41.983 --> 09:43.174
Kombucha pooped here.

09:43.184 --> 09:44.843
He didn't mean to.

09:44.853 --> 09:47.412
When he does it on purpose, you know.

09:47.422 --> 09:49.714
- But, it's fine.
- Okay, cool.

09:49.724 --> 09:51.516
Great attitude, Dana. I'm gonna go.

09:51.526 --> 09:53.251
Okay, have fun spending an evening

09:53.261 --> 09:56.888
with your family and friends.

09:56.898 --> 09:58.723
Well, I can't when
you're crying like that.

09:58.733 --> 10:00.358
I'll get the ammonia.

10:00.368 --> 10:02.861
The janitor's union
will have a fit, but...

10:02.871 --> 10:04.896
I can handle Mervin.

10:04.906 --> 10:07.198
Thank you.

10:09.377 --> 10:10.668
Hey, where's your mom?

10:10.678 --> 10:13.605
She still at your super exclusive
rehearsal that I don't care about?

10:13.615 --> 10:15.940
Oh, she noticed all my belts
were kind of whatever,

10:15.950 --> 10:17.442
so she went out to buy me new ones.

10:17.452 --> 10:19.244
Okay. Well, hey.

10:19.254 --> 10:20.578
You ready to do that speech?

10:20.588 --> 10:22.714
I already took a whack at it.
Killer jokes.

10:22.724 --> 10:24.516
Kids still know
the movie "Commando," right?

10:24.526 --> 10:26.885
Yeah, I'm sorry, but
I'm working on my musical.

10:26.895 --> 10:28.520
Thank God my mom's here.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.421
She showed us how to
hold a baby during a fire.

10:30.431 --> 10:31.789
You put them in your bag and run,

10:31.799 --> 10:33.258
like shoplifting.

10:33.268 --> 10:34.425
- Smart.
- Mm-hmm.

10:34.435 --> 10:36.394
Um, hey, real quickly.

10:36.404 --> 10:38.963
Uh, you don't hate living here, right?

10:38.973 --> 10:41.399
- It's not terrible.
- Yeah... it's good.

10:41.409 --> 10:42.967
I mean, it doesn't really help my.

10:42.977 --> 10:45.303
"Ohio farm boy straight
to Broadway legend" story.

10:45.313 --> 10:47.038
So, don't be upset if I'm forced to

10:47.048 --> 10:49.607
omit you from my biography.

10:49.617 --> 10:51.042
Michael? Michael.

10:51.052 --> 10:53.745
I know exactly what you
should text back Gregg.

10:53.755 --> 10:56.581
- Nails painting emoji.
- Ugh, oh my God, of course.

10:56.591 --> 10:59.250
It's been there this whole time.
But what race?

10:59.260 --> 11:00.743
One shade darker than you are, always.

11:00.754 --> 11:02.921
Oh, okay.

11:02.931 --> 11:04.589
Oh my gosh!

11:04.599 --> 11:06.267
Gregg just sent me the peach emoji.

11:06.278 --> 11:07.509
- What?
- I could die!

11:07.520 --> 11:09.126
That's basically like
a marriage proposal.

11:09.137 --> 11:11.828
- Right?
- Let's practice your dance for your wedding.

11:19.723 --> 11:22.262
<i>- I'm obviously the Hoda.
- You're the Kathie Lee.</i>

11:22.273 --> 11:23.691
<i>I'm the Hoda.</i>

11:23.702 --> 11:25.401
Hey, Michael. Time for school.

11:25.412 --> 11:27.512
You got your Social Media
final today, right?

11:27.840 --> 11:29.407
Fine.

11:29.409 --> 11:31.208
Mom, do not watch "Drag Race" without me

11:31.210 --> 11:32.968
and pretend you haven't seen it later.

11:32.978 --> 11:34.603
You gasp too loud at who wins lip-sync.

11:34.613 --> 11:35.633
You got it.

11:35.644 --> 11:36.664
Bye.

11:36.675 --> 11:38.173
See you, buddy.

11:38.183 --> 11:39.908
Hey, um...

11:39.918 --> 11:41.343
Priya, I've been thinking.

11:41.353 --> 11:43.245
You and Michael do
have a special connection.

11:43.255 --> 11:45.113
- Right? Don't we?
- Yeah.

11:45.123 --> 11:46.815
Oh my God. It's like we have one brain.

11:46.825 --> 11:48.283
I'll be like,
"Hey should we get a pizza?"

11:48.293 --> 11:50.025
And he's like, "Yeah,
why is it not already here?"

11:50.036 --> 11:51.586
Right, Which is why I think

11:51.596 --> 11:54.923
it might be in
Michael's best interest to

11:54.933 --> 11:57.192
go back to Cleveland next semester.

11:57.202 --> 11:58.493
- What?
- Yeah.

11:58.503 --> 12:00.095
Oh my God.

12:02.171 --> 12:04.212
<i>Thank you all for coming
to this emergency meeting.</i>

12:04.223 --> 12:06.034
One of our coworkers needs our help.

12:06.044 --> 12:09.004
Yes, we need an intervention
about Vince's haircut.

12:09.014 --> 12:10.479
It makes his head look even smaller.

12:10.490 --> 12:11.640
It's not that.

12:11.650 --> 12:14.509
Dana's been going through a bit
of a rough patch lately, so...

12:14.519 --> 12:16.144
We're firing her. Yes!

12:16.154 --> 12:18.013
I'm adding her to our text chain.

12:18.023 --> 12:20.015
What? That is so drastic.

12:20.025 --> 12:22.484
Can't we like,
learn her last name instead?

12:22.494 --> 12:25.554
Yeah, I mean, that text chain is
the only place I can really be me.

12:25.564 --> 12:27.222
As an older white man, where else can I

12:27.232 --> 12:29.191
share my opinions on immigration?

12:29.201 --> 12:30.992
Guys, we're doing it.

12:31.002 --> 12:33.995
<i>Dana, welcome to
the Champion staff text chain.</i>

12:35.073 --> 12:36.419
Done.

12:37.909 --> 12:39.034
<i>Wow! Thanks!</i>

12:39.044 --> 12:41.203
<i>Can everyone say which number is theirs?</i>

12:41.213 --> 12:43.171
<i>Somehow you've never given them to me.</i>

12:43.181 --> 12:44.673
See? It's not so bad.

12:44.683 --> 12:46.408
Alexa, play us a song.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.378
Oh, there you guys are.

12:50.388 --> 12:52.180
I just wanted to check in
and see if my texts

12:52.190 --> 12:53.548
are coming through okay.

12:53.558 --> 12:56.384
I didn't get a thumbs up
on my first one.

12:56.394 --> 12:58.687
Should I call Verizon?

13:01.566 --> 13:04.059
<i>Anybody up for poker in the break room?</i>

13:04.069 --> 13:06.895
The buy-in is a stick of gum
<i>or a French postcard.</i>

13:06.905 --> 13:09.431
Bud, if you have free time,
<i>maybe you can fill out</i>

13:09.441 --> 13:11.900
<i>your time card like I've been asking?</i>

13:17.249 --> 13:19.074
<i>âª And these are the breaks</i>

13:19.084 --> 13:22.110
<i>OMG, check out this man-punzel realness.</i>

13:22.120 --> 13:24.579
<i>I'll give you $20 if you climb it.</i>

13:24.589 --> 13:26.581
<i>Excuse me? I have integrity.</i>

13:26.591 --> 13:28.583
<i>I wouldn't do it for less than 50.</i>

13:28.593 --> 13:30.218
<i>It's actually against our gym policy</i>

13:30.228 --> 13:32.120
<i>to take photos of members.</i>

13:32.130 --> 13:34.923
<i>Can we all agree to delete
that picture for legal reasons?</i>

13:38.637 --> 13:40.262
<i>You guys are not gonna believe</i>

13:40.272 --> 13:42.964
<i>this monster boog' I just picked.</i>

13:42.974 --> 13:44.432
<i>Pics or it didn't happen.</i>

13:44.442 --> 13:46.134
<i>That sounds really cool.</i>

13:46.144 --> 13:47.969
<i>But let's talk about it after work?</i>

13:47.979 --> 13:50.272
<i>A minute wasted is a dollar lost.</i>

13:50.282 --> 13:51.640
That's it!

13:51.650 --> 13:53.275
I can't take it anymore.

13:53.285 --> 13:56.044
Ruby has left the conversation!

13:56.054 --> 13:58.413
But, like, how do you do that?

13:58.423 --> 14:01.358
Dana! Help me!

14:02.227 --> 14:03.418
Okay, people!

14:03.428 --> 14:05.053
Let's run the finale again.

14:05.063 --> 14:07.122
I need those screams
to be more harrowing.

14:07.132 --> 14:09.491
And put more soot on all
those background players.

14:09.501 --> 14:12.093
Serve me blackened tilapia, honey.

14:12.103 --> 14:13.261
From the top.

14:13.271 --> 14:14.462
Michael, I have to say,

14:14.472 --> 14:16.164
this show is really coming together.

14:16.174 --> 14:17.499
I'm gonna miss you.

14:17.509 --> 14:19.434
Miss me? Am I being expelled?

14:19.444 --> 14:21.570
Is this because I ate your sandwich?

14:21.580 --> 14:22.771
No.

14:22.781 --> 14:24.472
I just received a transcript request

14:24.482 --> 14:26.608
from the Cleveland Repertory
Academy of Performance.

14:26.618 --> 14:28.176
They said you're transferring.

14:28.186 --> 14:29.477
What?

14:29.487 --> 14:31.580
Transferring?

14:31.590 --> 14:33.281
Back to Cleveland?

14:33.291 --> 14:34.516
But I burned all my bridges.

14:34.526 --> 14:37.319
I said I didn't like
Lebron James' beard.

14:37.329 --> 14:38.787
Michael, I'm so sorry.

14:38.797 --> 14:40.739
I didn't know your parents
hadn't told you yet.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.657
I don't have parents. At the Tony's,

14:42.667 --> 14:44.292
I'm only thanking my agents.

14:44.302 --> 14:45.660
And the American Theatre Wing.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.665
Wow, much better on the screams, guys.

14:50.675 --> 14:53.177
Nice improvement.

14:54.112 --> 14:56.171
You're kidnapping me back to Ohio?

14:56.181 --> 14:57.709
Am I really supposed to spend
another year

14:57.720 --> 14:59.107
with you breathing down my neck,

14:59.117 --> 15:00.771
supporting every little thing that I do?

15:00.782 --> 15:02.177
Yes, but you will be attending

15:02.187 --> 15:04.212
the Cleveland Repertory
Academy for Performance.

15:04.222 --> 15:05.513
Michael, it's a great school.

15:05.523 --> 15:06.912
And you get to live with your mom.

15:06.923 --> 15:08.761
She's got the brains and
interests of a gay teenager.

15:08.772 --> 15:10.444
- Isn't that what you want?
- Okay, don't tell me what I want.

15:10.455 --> 15:12.187
I wanted one long feather earring

15:12.197 --> 15:13.355
and you didn't let me do that.

15:13.365 --> 15:14.689
This is what's best for you.

15:14.699 --> 15:16.256
Best for Michael? Are you crazy?

15:16.267 --> 15:18.933
He's supposed to grow up without a
strong uncle figure in his life?

15:18.944 --> 15:21.630
I won't leave. And can you just
stop making decisions for me?

15:21.640 --> 15:23.498
I swear, this is the last time,

15:23.508 --> 15:25.166
unless you get engaged to someone poor.

15:25.176 --> 15:26.741
Oh, okay and you're just letting her?

15:26.752 --> 15:29.537
Wow, once again, doing whatever you
can to not be a part of my life.

15:29.547 --> 15:31.172
Honey, no, listen.

15:31.182 --> 15:32.707
I will let you get a feather earring.

15:32.717 --> 15:34.631
Hell, I'll get one too.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.544
Well, I don't think I
need to state the obvious

15:36.554 --> 15:38.313
but I'm also moving to Cleveland.

15:38.323 --> 15:39.748
Enjoy dying alone.

15:50.261 --> 15:53.120
Gregg, don't be nervous.
You've done fantastic work.

15:53.131 --> 15:54.644
And when you sing "Melting For You,"

15:54.655 --> 15:56.354
I feel the fire on my face.

15:56.365 --> 15:58.065
Well, like every great director,

15:58.076 --> 16:00.674
you told me I was worthless garbage
until I finally got better.

16:00.685 --> 16:02.618
It's been an honor.

16:03.924 --> 16:05.215
Thanks.

16:05.226 --> 16:07.318
Break a leg, Gregg.

16:07.328 --> 16:10.130
I won't let you down.

16:11.199 --> 16:14.425
Remember me when I'm gone.

16:14.435 --> 16:16.995
<i>Wow. My boyfriend dumped me.</i>

16:17.005 --> 16:18.763
<i>And my text chain dumped me.</i>

16:18.773 --> 16:20.798
But I'll be fine.

16:20.808 --> 16:23.267
Maybe I'll just start
making handmade jewelry.

16:23.277 --> 16:25.339
Dana, enough. I have my own problems.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.813
The reason you're alone right
now, is because you're annoying.

16:27.824 --> 16:29.073
As Michael would say,

16:29.083 --> 16:30.942
"Don't be thirsty, hunty. O-kerrr?"

16:33.957 --> 16:36.814
Look, If you want friends,
you gotta relax around people

16:36.824 --> 16:38.416
and be a little more fun.

16:39.594 --> 16:41.452
You want "fun Dana?"

16:41.462 --> 16:42.954
I'll show you fun Dana.

16:45.867 --> 16:47.959
If my heart weren't all broken
by Michael leaving,

16:47.969 --> 16:50.261
I would be on the floor
laughing right now.

16:50.271 --> 16:52.463
I love that. Keep it up.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.368
Hey. Hey there, buddy.

16:57.378 --> 16:59.103
Some good wigs here.

16:59.113 --> 17:00.872
Yeah, well I'm surprised
you even showed up.

17:00.882 --> 17:02.940
Shouldn't you be eating at
Buffalo Wild Wings

17:02.950 --> 17:04.308
or watching "American Dad"

17:04.318 --> 17:06.310
or whatever it is childless men do.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.547
Michael, I'm sorry the way
the news got sprung on you.

17:09.557 --> 17:11.148
I don't want you to go.

17:11.159 --> 17:12.796
I just think it's the right thing to do.

17:12.807 --> 17:14.352
Look, you're all your mom has.

17:14.362 --> 17:15.887
And I see what you guys have together

17:15.896 --> 17:17.989
and I can't give you that.

17:17.999 --> 17:20.558
I physically cannot watch
that much reality television.

17:20.568 --> 17:22.627
Wait, so you are doing this
for the right reasons?

17:22.637 --> 17:24.028
Yeah.

17:24.038 --> 17:26.497
But I promise I'm going to come visit,

17:26.507 --> 17:28.633
make sure you and Priya
aren't buried under filth.

17:28.643 --> 17:31.235
Like, um... "Hoarders?"

17:31.245 --> 17:32.837
I taught you more then you'll ever know.

17:32.847 --> 17:34.038
Okay.

17:34.048 --> 17:36.040
Whoa, lights. Must be time to go.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.076
Okay, I don't really know
what to say before

17:38.086 --> 17:40.344
a non-athletic event, so...

17:40.354 --> 17:42.046
- Oh.
- Go get 'em!

17:42.056 --> 17:43.981
Wait. You write your speech?

17:43.991 --> 17:46.184
Yes, but now that I'm not angry at you,

17:46.194 --> 17:47.518
most of the jokes won't land.

17:47.528 --> 17:48.553
Thanks a lot.

17:49.597 --> 17:51.022
I'm angry again.

17:51.032 --> 17:54.067
Let's do this.

17:55.136 --> 17:57.862
<i>Hi, I saw everyone quit
the last text chain,</i>

17:57.872 --> 17:59.097
<i>so I made a new one.</i>

17:59.107 --> 18:01.399
My God, she keeps coming back.

18:01.409 --> 18:02.934
You know, like a movie monster.

18:02.944 --> 18:05.002
- Or casual racism.
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.012 --> 18:07.538
<i>I'll try not to ruin
this one by being so lame.</i>

18:07.548 --> 18:09.574
<i>Hashtag epic fail.</i>

18:09.584 --> 18:10.942
<i>It me.</i>

18:10.952 --> 18:12.243
I like that.

18:12.253 --> 18:15.113
It's funny because it looks like
he really hurt himself.

18:15.123 --> 18:17.448
<i>What is this? Why am I on this?</i>

18:17.458 --> 18:19.050
<i>It's called a text chain, Vince.</i>

18:19.060 --> 18:20.084
<i>Don't be a loser.</i>

18:20.094 --> 18:21.352
<i>Oh, snap.</i>

18:21.362 --> 18:24.021
<i>Vince got owned, by Dana!</i>

18:24.031 --> 18:25.523
<i>Please don't text me.</i>

18:25.533 --> 18:27.084
<i>It's very expensive for my phone plan.</i>

18:27.095 --> 18:30.094
<i>Okay, grandpa. I'll save the
emojis for someone else.</i>

18:30.104 --> 18:32.697
<i>Damn, Dana, you on fire and I love it.</i>

18:36.244 --> 18:39.203
Hey, Dana's suddenly cool.
What happened?

18:39.213 --> 18:41.475
I just told her she was super
annoying and then clucked.

18:41.486 --> 18:44.705
So an actual performance review?

18:45.089 --> 18:46.882
I don't like that at all.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.112
Shh.

19:01.636 --> 19:03.261
Hello

19:03.271 --> 19:05.596
and thank you
for coming to "Shirtwaist!",

19:05.606 --> 19:09.967
An Incendiary Musical by Michael Patel."

19:09.977 --> 19:13.237
I first want to start
by thanking my cast and crew.

19:13.247 --> 19:14.605
I could have done it without you,

19:14.615 --> 19:16.340
but I'm glad I didn't have to.

19:18.619 --> 19:20.278
Actually, I...

19:21.956 --> 19:24.682
want to thank the person
who made this possible:

19:24.692 --> 19:26.284
Vince.

19:26.294 --> 19:29.287
Going to this school
has been incredible.

19:29.297 --> 19:31.589
But the best part of moving to New York,

19:31.599 --> 19:35.092
has been living with you and Matthew.

19:35.102 --> 19:38.329
Well, sorry, kid we gave
a full scholarship to.

19:38.339 --> 19:40.598
The greatest lesson you've
taught me is to

19:40.608 --> 19:42.533
work hard and never give up.

19:42.543 --> 19:44.635
Sure it makes you a huge dork...

19:45.980 --> 19:48.606
I don't get it. Is the joke
that I'm actually cool?

19:48.616 --> 19:50.141
Oh, that's funny. I like that.

19:51.319 --> 19:53.144
But you're right.

19:53.154 --> 19:57.348
And if you think moving to Ohio
is what's best for me...

19:57.358 --> 19:59.450
then I guess it must be.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.185
Okay, enough chitchat.

20:01.195 --> 20:03.054
Let's burn this place to the ground.

20:03.064 --> 20:04.155
Whoo!

20:08.970 --> 20:12.138
Boss Moneybags, it's time
for the fire safety check.

20:13.074 --> 20:14.699
You were so good.

20:14.709 --> 20:17.068
Man, I still can't believe
how good that was.

20:17.078 --> 20:20.238
For two hours, I felt like I
was burning to death... of joy.

20:20.248 --> 20:21.539
Well, you killed it.

20:21.549 --> 20:23.007
And I went in as a skeptic,

20:23.017 --> 20:24.575
but that song where the actors came out

20:24.585 --> 20:27.378
and pointed out the actual fire exits?

20:27.388 --> 20:28.746
- Chills.
- It was amazing.

20:28.756 --> 20:30.514
It was like watching
"Wicked" on Broadway,

20:30.524 --> 20:32.316
except in this show,
I wasn't thrown out for

20:32.326 --> 20:33.718
yelling, "This is just Frozen!"

20:33.728 --> 20:35.253
Thanks, Mom. Maybe they'll let me

20:35.263 --> 20:37.321
restage the show
in Cleveland next semester.

20:37.331 --> 20:40.558
I'd have to make all
the characters white, of course.

20:40.568 --> 20:42.560
Actually, after seeing that tonight,

20:42.570 --> 20:45.396
and seeing how happy you are...

20:45.406 --> 20:47.565
I decided that you should stay here.

20:47.575 --> 20:49.200
Yeah.

20:49.210 --> 20:51.035
Plus, New York needs your glamour,

20:51.045 --> 20:52.536
what with Melania in DC.

20:52.546 --> 20:53.537
Wait.

20:53.547 --> 20:54.839
Priya, are you serious?

20:54.849 --> 20:56.540
Yeah, Vince. This is his home.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.050
And I cannot believe I'm saying this,

20:58.061 --> 21:01.258
but I think New York might actually
have more to offer you than Cleveland.

21:01.269 --> 21:02.747
Mom. Thank you.

21:05.559 --> 21:07.051
Bye. I love you.

21:07.061 --> 21:08.352
I love you, too.

21:08.362 --> 21:09.854
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:14.468 --> 21:16.060
You know I'll need a shopping spree

21:16.070 --> 21:17.728
in order to properly grieve my mother.

21:17.738 --> 21:20.431
She's not dead
and your clothes are fine.

21:20.441 --> 21:21.641
<i>Go do the dishes.</i>
