00:01.102 --> 00:03.037
Previously on Supergirl...

00:03.071 --> 00:04.172
I think he likes you.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.773
I'm his boss.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.075
That's some ship
you got there.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.008
Who's in the other chambers?

00:08.309 --> 00:10.411
We call ourselves The Legion.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.146
This is your purpose.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.115
To fight the devil.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.253
I have been trying to get you
to embrace your humanity,

00:19.287 --> 00:22.723
but forget that.
Be cold. Be alien.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.160
All I am is
truth and judgment.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.461
And I will reign.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.157
It's you.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.359
Can I help you?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.095
Now you're talking to me.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.197
Supergirl is talking to me.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.265
Inside. Now.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.136
I am Brainiac-5.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.404
Half-computer,
half-organic lifeform,

01:10.438 --> 01:13.541
all Coluan, and, not to brag,
but a 12th-level intellect.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.111
My name is Querl Dox,

01:18.312 --> 01:20.214
but the Legionnaires
just call me Brainy.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.682
Legionnaires?
Did Mon

01:22.483 --> 01:26.287
Yes, yes. To make sure
that your neural pathways
are clear and intact.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.290
You brain is in
truly remarkable health

01:29.323 --> 01:31.292
for someone languishing
in a coma.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.795
Uh, I'm sorry,
did you say "coma"?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.331
Mmm, did I bury the lede?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.133
You've been in a coma
for two days.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.268
I'm in my loft.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.270
Wow. Oh.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.637
You mean the physical
manifestation

01:43.671 --> 01:46.274
of the place in which your
subconscious feels most
comfortable?

01:47.275 --> 01:48.108
That loft?

01:51.212 --> 01:53.214
If I'm in a coma,
how are you here?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.517
Mon-El woke me up
from hypersleep to
communicate with you

01:56.550 --> 01:59.287
on behalf of him
and your DEO compatriots.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.190
31st century technology.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.225
It's also what's
keeping you alive.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.459
Alive?

02:05.493 --> 02:07.295
Reign defeated you.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.463
Don't you remember?

02:14.268 --> 02:16.270
Stay with me, Kara,
stay with me.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.553
No, this is crazy. This...

02:33.387 --> 02:34.555
Reign is still out there.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.891
People are dying,
I have to wake up.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.195
I don't think
you're listening to me.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.231
What?

02:46.367 --> 02:49.270
-Can we just, maybe,
relax a little bit?

02:49.303 --> 02:50.471
Damn it! It won't open!

03:02.950 --> 03:05.519
Well, the good news is
her mind is active and alert.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.355
-Oh, thank God.
-Yes.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.524
The bad news is,
she is very angry.

03:10.558 --> 03:14.462
Well, I'm sure she loves being
trapped inside a mind prison.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.598
You're speaking with her right
now, even as you're speaking
with us?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.568
The crown connects
to my internal AI core.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.570
It translates
her brainwaves to English

03:22.603 --> 03:24.472
and sends electronic signals
back to her.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.640
These tanks have
incredible healing power,

03:26.674 --> 03:29.377
so she just needs to rest
and let it do its work.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.345
You're from the future,

03:31.379 --> 03:32.980
did you know this
was gonna happen?

03:33.013 --> 03:35.316
No, but she's through
the worst of it, she'll live.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.450
But when will she wake up?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.352
We don't know.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.354
Well, Reign is still out there.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.325
I don't like our odds
without Supergirl by our side.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.494
I mean, Reign's been quiet,
maybe she got injured, too.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.061
Let's hope so.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.997
It's only a matter of time
before she strikes again.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.361
Oh, crap!

04:20.394 --> 04:23.597
-Ah! Okay, stop. Hold on!
Pause game!

04:23.631 --> 04:26.400
And you thought
I was gonna break something.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.336
Ah, jeez.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.005
That's Clara.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.443
-The movie's in half an hour.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.079
Okay. Well, you're making me
dinner tonight, right?
It's your turn.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.382
Any dietary restrictions
I should know about?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.484
I'm allergic to bad food.

04:44.017 --> 04:44.952
Okay.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.054
Well, save up for dinner.
Don't eat too much.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.425
Mom?

04:52.593 --> 04:53.594
Love you.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.508
You have done well, my child.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.446
You easily vanquished the
daughter of the House of El.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.682
You left your mark
on this city.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.352
But there is much
yet to be accomplished.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.354
What would you have me do?

05:20.388 --> 05:22.423
This world needs
to be cleansed,

05:22.456 --> 05:25.359
not just of sinners
but those who harbor them.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.462
It is time to deliver
the awakening.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.431
How?

05:30.464 --> 05:33.534
Those who would do evil operate

05:33.567 --> 05:35.803
in broad daylight
without shame.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.740
For the righteous have cast
their eyes to the ground.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.643
Force their gaze
back to the light.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.346
Show them what
justice really is.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.476
It's been two days
since the world
saw Supergirl be brutalized

06:15.509 --> 06:17.611
and still not a word about her
whereabouts or well-being.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.147
She'll turn up.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.516
I hope so.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.487
And Kara's the only reporter
who had a knack for
tracking her down.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.387
Is she in yet?

06:27.588 --> 06:28.789
Kara? She...

06:29.557 --> 06:30.458
No, she's, um...

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
No, she's not, actually.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.632
James, I was thinking,
when Kara gets in,
maybe we should

06:38.832 --> 06:41.569
all have a little...
A little talk about
what happened.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.773
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.174
Yes, we should. Yeah.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.546
It's just that, you know,
we all work together,

06:52.580 --> 06:55.549
and we're Kara's
two best friends,
and you guys used to date,

06:55.583 --> 06:57.551
so she should know
that we kissed.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.286
Definitely.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.189
I come from a family
that lies, and we all know
how that turns out, so...

07:11.164 --> 07:12.600
Why have you come here?

07:12.633 --> 07:13.734
To deliver a message.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.835
We are not your messengers.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.705
Yes, you are.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.640
You.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.609
-Turn your camera on me.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.617
This man was a thief,

07:29.650 --> 07:31.451
condemned by his own actions.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.856
You've allowed sin to take root
and fester like a weed.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.758
And, worst of all,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.627
you have looked away.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.896
Apathy is the
greatest sin of all.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.666
From now on
it will be punished in kind.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.635
There will be no more mercy.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.803
There will only be justice.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.541
I'm here to help.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.452
I'm here to help.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.556
She's declaring
war on criminality
in National City.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.456
Not just
against the criminals,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.592
it's against
the entire justice system.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.193
We have to stop her.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.394
Without Supergirl?

08:14.427 --> 08:18.532
I mean, we have
a literal legion
of superheros here.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.868
I owe you all my life.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.172
And I hope you know
that I would do anything
I could for you.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.876
But, unfortunately,
this can't be our fight.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.545
Surely we can
help them somehow.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.681
If we die now we will
endanger the future.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.582
What do you mean?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.684
-We're on a mission.
-Careful.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.953
Our involvement here
could jeopardize that.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.693
I can tell you what we do know.
We know that Supergirl lives.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.629
And we know that eventually
Reign will leave.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.567
So that's...
That's all you can give?
That's all you got?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.569
We really don't know
much at all.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.038
In the year 2455,

08:58.071 --> 09:01.108
Earth experienced
a third-degree
extinction phenomenon.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.310
Humanity came together,

09:03.343 --> 09:06.680
but Earth suffered
catastrophic destruction.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.181
It wasn't just loss of life,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.984
it was its history,

09:11.018 --> 09:12.686
culture, art, music.

09:13.153 --> 09:13.954
It was everything interesting.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.657
Mon-El taught us
everything we know.

09:16.690 --> 09:20.193
From Aristotle,
Shakespeare, Bon Jovi.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.097
But we have some gaps.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.767
And, unfortunately,
even if we know the end result,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.235
we don't necessarily know
how it happens.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.570
So we know
that Supergirl lives,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.641
and we know that Reign leaves,

09:34.174 --> 09:35.242
eventually.

09:35.275 --> 09:39.046
But before she does,
she could slaughter thousands.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.748
Yeah, so what do we do now?

09:40.781 --> 09:41.949
The Sundown Protocol.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.119
A highly-classified contingency
plan to take down Superman

09:46.153 --> 09:47.254
if ever he turns against us.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.659
Red sun grenades, sound bombs,
Kryptonite darts,

09:51.692 --> 09:54.261
everything we'd need
to take down a rogue
Kryptonian on the loose.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.329
Sorry, we don't have
any more Kryptonite.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.631
Clark got rid of it all.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.032
Clark got rid of it
for a reason,

09:59.066 --> 10:00.701
and a reason
that Kara agreed to.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.202
That was before Reign.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.672
We still have the Kryptonite
from Coville's probe, right?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.642
Prep whatever you have to,
but before you use it,

10:09.176 --> 10:10.678
there's someone
I have to talk to.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.289
Ooh!

10:22.322 --> 10:23.423
Your eye! What happened to you?

10:23.456 --> 10:27.728
Oh. I was spreading the truth
to my fellow inmates.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.763
They would have
preferred I lied.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.332
Do you want to spread
a little truth to me?

10:33.033 --> 10:34.702
I'll pass it along
to Supergirl.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.704
You're her biggest fan, right?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.041
She said that you knew
about the reign of the beast.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.711
What else do you know
that can help us beat her?

10:43.744 --> 10:44.745
Beat her?

10:45.345 --> 10:46.814
She's already won.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.648
No. Supergirl's still alive.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.184
She was supposed to rise,

10:51.418 --> 10:52.753
find her faith,

10:53.186 --> 10:54.287
and deliver it.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.091
But Supergirl refused her faith

10:58.125 --> 11:00.227
and she failed the test.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.697
Supergirl will defeat her.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.834
You just have to
help us stop her.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.706
Supergirl lost

11:13.340 --> 11:16.143
so that Reign can prepare us
for what comes next.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.379
Never underestimate Supergirl.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.487
Hey. Just put out
a press release

11:27.520 --> 11:29.790
telling the city that CatCo
is no longer under siege

11:29.823 --> 11:31.691
and urging the public
to stay calm.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.126
Calm?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.194
The streets are desolate.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.396
People are barricading
themselves in their homes.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.898
The city is terrified.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.734
Yeah, but there are people
out there working
to rectify the situation.

11:40.768 --> 11:41.835
Okay? Don't worry.

11:42.169 --> 11:42.803
Um...

11:45.138 --> 11:48.141
James, I know why you were
acting strange earlier on.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.409
No, you don't.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.111
Listen, there's
no reason to explain.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.846
We're both adults,
we're just not a match.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.217
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no. I wasn't...
No. No. I didn't say that.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.287
It was... It was Kara.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.923
You're acting awkward
because you guys used to date?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.257
No. No, that's not it, either.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.726
-She's just...

12:09.830 --> 12:12.399
She's sick. She's sick.
She has the flu.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.168
It's just a really, really,
really, really, really bad flu.
It's just...

12:15.468 --> 12:17.504
You know how people get
when they get a flu,
they get vulnerable.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.306
God, she won't
mind me knowing.
I'm her best friend.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.841
You know,
I should go over there.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.475
Yeah, that's good.
You're a good friend.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.877
-But...

12:24.244 --> 12:25.378
Soup.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.448
-Sick people love soup.
-Okay, I'll get her some soup.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.482
-Minestrone--
-Yeah. Soup.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.119
Tomato, chicken noodle,
anything that could...

12:34.822 --> 12:36.756
Winn, I need
your help right now.

12:37.891 --> 12:38.892
This is torture.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.131
Out of all the 4,237,642

12:44.164 --> 12:46.867
versions of our first meeting
that I envisioned,

12:46.900 --> 12:51.171
you calling it "torture"
wasn't one of them.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.376
What are you doing?

12:56.409 --> 12:57.310
Checking for brain damage.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.412
In simulacra,
like the one we're in now,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.581
brain damage could present
itself in any number of ways.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.818
Mildew, mold. Rats indicate
neurological issues.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.887
It's just to prepare you
for reality re-entry.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.788
Reality re

13:09.923 --> 13:10.457
If you're not properly prepared
when we wake you up,

13:10.490 --> 13:11.859
you could go into shock.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.360
Some people die immediately.

13:13.927 --> 13:14.928
Yeah.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.864
Wait, though. Does...

13:18.165 --> 13:19.532
Does that mean
I'm ready to wake up?

13:20.533 --> 13:21.835
Did I bury the lede again?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.340
Yes! Okay, do I need
to do anything?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.544
Well, your loft is
the manifestation
of your subconscious.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.848
And that door seems to be
the only way in or out.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.483
My assumption,

13:36.950 --> 13:37.817
walk through it.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.556
It's starting to drain.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.258
She's ready.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.535
Kara, it's me.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.907
She should be fine.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.347
It's not opening.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.887
You should be fine.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.855
Why isn't she waking up?

14:27.467 --> 14:28.868
Why won't this open?

14:29.569 --> 14:30.971
Your body is fine.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.975
We drained the tank,
you suffered no ill-effects
from the hibernation.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.944
Then why am I
still stuck in my brain?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.046
There's nothing wrong
with your brain.

14:39.079 --> 14:39.879
We've ruled that out.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.350
Well, you're the
12th-level intellect.
Why don't you figure it out?

14:46.686 --> 14:47.988
Well, that rules out
the physical.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.624
So, barring
another explanation,

14:52.025 --> 14:55.428
I would have to say
the only thing keeping you here

14:55.462 --> 14:56.329
is you.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.366
Well, that doesn't
make any sense,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.368
'cause I'm the one
that wants to get out of here.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.937
Then why won't this thing open?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.573
It opened for me earlier.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.375
To let me in. Going out...

15:11.478 --> 15:12.412
Different story.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.948
Is there some reason
your subconscious might be--

15:18.085 --> 15:19.452
Preventing your escape?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.989
Self

15:24.457 --> 15:25.525
I'm not afraid.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.060
You were badly beaten.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.303
Fear is a logical response
to that stimulus.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.078
I am not afraid!

16:24.117 --> 16:25.452
Come on, Kara, snap out of it.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.020
Brainy will figure it out.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.721
Don't overpromise.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.558
I've never seen
anything like this before.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.362
I'm sorry.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.064
Insensitive.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.599
What happens if
she stays like this?

16:40.067 --> 16:41.701
The longer she
remains unconscious,

16:41.734 --> 16:44.071
the more likely it is
that it will become permanent.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.642
Reign's attacking again.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.018
I'm getting us a feed.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.722
She attacked a meth lab.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.492
The cops arrived,
she attacked them, too.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.197
I'll run another scan on Kara.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.033
Mon-El.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.804
We can't risk it.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.107
Risk what?

17:21.708 --> 17:25.178
So 1,000 years from now,
this farming planet, Winath,

17:25.445 --> 17:26.446
goes dark.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.150
Our friend, Ayla, she's from
there, so she goes
to check it out.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.851
Winath was a paradise,

17:31.884 --> 17:35.222
but Ayla made planet-fall
and found it--

17:35.255 --> 17:35.855
Decimated.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.458
It was completely dried out.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.394
The creatures that did this,
we call them the Blight.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.430
-They consume
everything in their path.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.234
And Brainy found a way
to stop them,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.136
but they were on us
before we could use it.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.839
So we hid the information
in the safest place we could.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.243
Our DNA.
Where it can't be lost,
can't be stolen.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.511
It written in our genes.

17:59.879 --> 18:03.250
So, if we die, our DNA
never makes it to the future.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.085
And everything's lost.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.459
You have no idea how badly
I wish we could help.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.265
Just make sure
my sister wakes up.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.737
J'onn, where are
you on Sundown?

18:25.205 --> 18:26.906
Sound guns are almost done,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.742
but the grenades will
take an hour, at least.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.179
And we still don't know where
Reign is gonna strike next.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.880
I think
I know how to get ahead of her.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.716
Hey, boss, so, uh...

18:37.517 --> 18:39.152
Uh, James just called.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.488
I fail to see the relevance.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.758
Well, it seems that he might
have put Kara into a little bit
of hot water

18:45.792 --> 18:46.926
with Lena Luthor.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.662
And since we have an hour...

18:49.696 --> 18:51.164
Oh, no, not again.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.718
The indignity.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.586
Kara, you in there?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.855
Yes.
Yes, I'm coming.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.592
Lena, what a surprise.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.328
Kara, you haven't
been answering my calls,
I've been worried.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.231
Yes, I've just been
trying to sleep off this...

19:26.633 --> 19:27.300
Flu.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.238
-Um, well...
-Chicken soup.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.839
That's very kind of you.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.674
You believe what's been
going on out here?

19:35.875 --> 19:39.212
Yes, I, uh, have been
keeping up with it.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.616
I am a reporter at a national
news organization.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.286
Yeah, I... I know.
You work for me.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.321
That fever is really
going to your head.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.723
You have no idea

19:50.923 --> 19:53.826
how much I am
not feeling like myself.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.530
Listen, I know this is
unimportant,

19:57.564 --> 19:59.332
given everything that's
going on right now, but...

20:02.935 --> 20:05.638
Yeah, it turns out
that you were right
about the chemistry.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.641
Uh, James and I kissed.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.810
Congratulations.

20:10.843 --> 20:11.944
Well, yeah.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.847
James is an amazing kisser,
as I'm sure you know.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.652
It's just, this morning
he started acting really odd.

20:21.788 --> 20:25.392
Olsen can be enigmatic.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.893
Yeah, well, I know
what it's about.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.298
I mean, my brother is Lex,
James is Superman's
best friend,

20:31.331 --> 20:34.901
and, you know,
for a minute there I forgot
my last name was Luthor.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.703
That's a mistake
I won't be making again.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.771
Oh, I'm sure
that's not the case.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.908
Olsen likes you.

20:42.909 --> 20:43.910
A lot.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.914
I assure you if James
is being awkward,

20:47.947 --> 20:48.915
it is not because of
your last name.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.018
And here I was coming
to make you feel better.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.622
I should go back to work.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.725
You should rest.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.926
Yes, boss.

21:14.374 --> 21:18.378
Agent Schott, don't ever
make me do that again.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.448
No Supergirl, no cavalry,

21:21.781 --> 21:23.316
and Reign is strong.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.652
She doesn't know
what we're capable of.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.020
-Let's show her.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.023
I just had a conversation about

21:31.057 --> 21:32.859
James Olsen's
extraordinary kissing ability.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.861
This'll be a Sunday picnic.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.339
Get on the ground!
Ger on the ground!
Don't look at me!

21:46.373 --> 21:49.376
Get on the ground!
This is a robbery!

21:49.742 --> 21:51.344
Don't look at me!
Don't touch that button!

21:51.378 --> 21:52.812
Nobody move!

21:52.845 --> 21:54.313
Nobody move!

21:56.849 --> 21:58.718
Hurry up!

22:01.454 --> 22:02.822
You were warned.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.337
Catch.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.419
Light her up.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.396
Now.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.375
No!

23:22.969 --> 23:24.571
Alex...

23:29.542 --> 23:30.543
Are you okay?

23:31.544 --> 23:32.845
Considering my tibia's
been snapped in half?

23:33.613 --> 23:34.681
What about Reign?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.783
She shrugged off
that Kryptonite
like it was nothing.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.019
Argh! Yes, thanks.
That's good.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.122
The same amount
incapacitated Kara.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.390
So why was Reign resistant?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.526
Maybe she's more
than just Kryptonian.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.461
No, the soil did hurt her,

23:48.495 --> 23:50.797
just not enough.

23:52.665 --> 23:53.432
You have a plan?

23:54.233 --> 23:55.167
Concentrate it.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.470
We'll put it straight
in her bloodstream.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.538
Jugular should work.

23:58.571 --> 24:01.508
Ah. One... One small hiccup.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.511
Uh, who would be strong enough
to hit her with the syringe?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.517
We have people counting
on us in the future,

24:10.550 --> 24:11.784
we can't get involved.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.185
You keep saying that.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.522
That this is not our fight.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.526
What about Tommy and Gina?

24:20.226 --> 24:21.393
Hmm?

24:21.427 --> 24:24.163
"You live for the fight
when it's all that you've got."

24:26.933 --> 24:27.934
-Bon Jovi.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.570
Or was that all a lie?

24:30.603 --> 24:33.039
No. No, he speaks the truth.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.013
I know we had a plan,

24:43.182 --> 24:44.517
but we are supposed
to help people.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.053
We're sworn to helping people.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.622
And these people
need our help right now.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.224
It's who we are.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.533
Why are you cleaning?

25:02.134 --> 25:03.636
None of this is real.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.504
I don't know.

25:06.606 --> 25:10.677
I guess I just like
putting things back in order.

25:12.111 --> 25:16.115
And my brain originally
is like an empty little attic

25:16.148 --> 25:20.019
and you must stock it with
such furniture as you choose.

25:21.588 --> 25:22.655
It's Sherlock Holmes.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.933
This is the furniture I chose.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.668
Hmm.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.969
Oversimplification.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.673
But, yes, go on.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.543
So there must be something
in here my subconscious
wants me to see.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.545
Hmm. That's...

25:48.014 --> 25:49.649
That's actually not a bad idea.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.118
Why didn't I think of that?

26:09.669 --> 26:10.970
I'm so sorry.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.306
I did this.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.778
I mean, I'm the one that
pushed you into that fight.

26:18.811 --> 26:23.182
I told you that Kara Danvers
was my favorite person,

26:24.350 --> 26:26.686
and then I told you
to forget who you were.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.155
And now I'm...

26:33.059 --> 26:34.961
I don't know if we can
do this without you.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.976
Huh.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.982
You had a pet?

26:56.182 --> 26:57.183
Yeah.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.755
But if this is my subconscious
trying to tell
myself something,

27:02.789 --> 27:03.790
I don't get it.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.158
Could be a random
neuron firing.
What's its name?

27:06.859 --> 27:07.727
Streaky.

27:09.261 --> 27:14.033
I, uh... I found him
on our street right after
I came to Earth, actually.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.002
He was a stray, too.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.070
You felt an emotional kinship.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.707
Yes. Yeah.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.074
We were friends.

27:28.214 --> 27:31.751
I used to go out
every night and feed him.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.654
I didn't wanna touch him.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.424
I was so strong,
I could have hurt him.

27:38.457 --> 27:42.394
So, I practiced being gentle.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.798
And then, one day,

27:48.034 --> 27:49.301
I pet him.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.671
And he purred.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.107
And everything was okay.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.346
I felt like an alien
on Earth for so long,

28:02.181 --> 28:03.783
and he helped me
feel like a human.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.386
Reign is finding
bigger targets.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.756
She wants to teach us
an abject lesson.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.292
She's going to cleanse the
sinners of society locked away.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.728
The ones that she feels
were granted mercy.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.866
She's going to
hit Albatross Bay.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.270
No, she's already there.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.372
She's gonna kill everyone.

28:26.405 --> 28:27.807
Prisoners, guards,
it won't matter.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.208
They'll be fish in a barrel.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.343
-I'll go.
-No, you can't.

28:31.911 --> 28:32.812
Not alone.

28:32.845 --> 28:33.813
She's too strong.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.384
You know, we have been
asleep for many years.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.720
And we ought to
get some exercise.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.490
You're being facetious?

28:46.258 --> 28:47.193
This guy.

29:23.095 --> 29:23.963
Don't move!

29:48.220 --> 29:51.490
Heir of Juru,
architect of the renewal,

29:52.024 --> 29:53.492
I submit to you.

29:53.993 --> 29:57.897
-For Rao is the light,
but he was born of fire.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.901
How do you know those words?

30:08.507 --> 30:11.210
I... I was awoken to them.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.580
People are quick
to claim salvation
when faced with death.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.852
Do you think that is enough
for me to spare you?

30:20.252 --> 30:21.921
You don't have to spare me.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.892
You just have to
let me serve you.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.991
I think we got her attention.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.128
You don't say.

31:03.295 --> 31:06.032
You will not interfere
with my mission.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.633
Interfering is our specialty.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.103
I've only come to cleanse
the sin of this world.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.039
Didn't feel like starting
with yourself then?

31:13.305 --> 31:14.907
I'm not of this world.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.045
Neither are we.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.638
Engaging cannons.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.975
Aloian attack formation.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.243
Are you fighting?

31:52.111 --> 31:53.980
Oh! Sprock!

31:54.246 --> 31:55.281
Did I say that out loud?

31:55.314 --> 31:56.682
What's going on out there?

31:57.083 --> 32:00.919
Little, little,
tiny baby battle.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.055
Actually,
let's keep talking.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.958
It'll help get my mind of this
life-or-death scenario.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.194
Your mind should be
on the life-or-death scenario.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.196
I'm perfectly capable
of multitasking.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.365
I'm actually working on your
Sunday crossword right now.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.601
Six-down is "Anguilloform."

32:15.634 --> 32:17.970
-Mon-El, evade!
-Don't be here, go help them.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.243
For what it's worth,

32:25.311 --> 32:26.945
it looks like Supergirl
had a pretty great life.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.315
These aren't Supergirl's
things, they're...

32:30.182 --> 32:31.250
They're Kara's.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.089
Your sister said something
similar a few minutes ago.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.124
What?

32:39.158 --> 32:42.394
She said Kara Danvers
is her favorite person.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.173
Careful, Brainy, you got
precious cargo on board.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.075
Knocked out the tri-cannons.

33:30.442 --> 33:31.210
-I'll need a minute
to get it back online.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.389
Time to put you back
in the hole you came from.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.390
Oh, my God. Kara.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.559
Hey.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.561
I have to help them.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.363
No, they're using Kryptonite.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.398
I don't care
if it makes me vulnerable,

35:00.266 --> 35:01.833
I'll use it against her.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.138
Reign won't see it coming.

35:12.311 --> 35:15.214
If you defend a sinner,
you must be a sinner.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.186
And I will wipe away
the sin of this world.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.160
I thought you were dead.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.461
I got better.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.129
Now!

35:47.446 --> 35:49.415
Now I cleanse you of your sin.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.310
Hey, we beat her. For now.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.346
Thanks for fighting
alongside us.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.314
It was an honor.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.220
-Hey, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.189
Hey, Kara.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.465
I was really worried about you.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.235
When you didn't wake up...

36:46.037 --> 36:47.339
I still care about you.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.508
I know.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.316
It was great fighting
with you again.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.617
Yeah.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.521
I missed that.

37:10.996 --> 37:11.997
Hey.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.400
It's you.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.601
Are you shorter?

37:17.936 --> 37:19.471
Are you suggesting that I

37:19.938 --> 37:21.407
augmented my height

37:21.440 --> 37:22.674
while I existed
in your consciousness

37:22.708 --> 37:25.644
so that you might see me
as a more stable
and trustworthy figure

37:25.677 --> 37:28.414
and therefore work
with me to help you?

37:28.947 --> 37:30.349
Uh, yeah?

37:31.650 --> 37:32.651
Yes.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.420
I did do exactly that.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.321
Okay.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.589
It's nice to meet you
in real life.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.506
Do you ever sleep?

37:55.541 --> 37:57.676
Yeah, well, Supergirl
just woke up from a coma

37:57.976 --> 37:59.545
just in time to save
a bunch of convicts

37:59.578 --> 38:01.447
who were about to be
wrongfully executed

38:01.480 --> 38:03.982
by a murderous alien.

38:04.383 --> 38:07.319
So, would you rather I
be sleeping or working?

38:09.355 --> 38:10.489
Working.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.463
How is she

38:17.663 --> 38:19.030
She's still sick.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.402
But, you know, we talked, and
despite her feverish delirium,

38:23.435 --> 38:24.503
she made me realize
a few things.

38:26.638 --> 38:30.041
I'm used to people reflexively
hating me because I'm a Luthor,

38:30.075 --> 38:32.378
and I turned
you being awkward about Kara

38:32.411 --> 38:33.712
into you being
awkward about me,

38:33.745 --> 38:34.780
so I pushed you away.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.549
And I don't want
to do that anymore.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.285
Good.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.555
Because I really like you,
Lena Luthor.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.359
Come here.

38:56.034 --> 38:59.538
And it's my masterpiece.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.608
-Wow. That's something.

39:02.641 --> 39:03.709
Wait, let me...

39:03.742 --> 39:05.043
Do that.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.412
What's this one?

39:06.445 --> 39:09.014
One-zero-zero-one-zero-one--

39:09.047 --> 39:10.516
-Brainiac-5.
-Oh. Yeah.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.050
That's code.

39:12.083 --> 39:17.556
So... So, I just have to
confirm that J'onn
pretended to be me, but sick,

39:18.424 --> 39:21.527
and then he talked about
kissing James with Lena?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.360
Yeah.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.830
-Yeah.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.434
It's weird.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.602
I wish I could have seen that.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.540
I'm just glad you're okay.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.475
You know I'd come back.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.578
I was really worried
about this one.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.412
Genuinely.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.482
But at least knowing
that Brainy could
communicate with you,

39:43.515 --> 39:44.516
I mean, that helped.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.553
-So weird.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.490
It was, you know,
it was illuminating.

39:51.523 --> 39:55.160
I had to remember who I was

39:55.727 --> 39:57.496
in order to wake up.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.868
Made me think differently about
the whole Mon-El situation.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.436
How so?

40:05.136 --> 40:07.105
I mean, it still hurts. A lot.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.173
Yeah.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.575
But...

40:11.577 --> 40:14.412
I'll be stronger for it.
Whatever happens.

40:15.481 --> 40:16.482
Yeah.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.687
Well, I'm totally happy
for your newfound wisdom.

40:22.688 --> 40:25.724
Um, maybe you
could avoid comas?

40:25.757 --> 40:27.559
-In the future.
That would be...

40:27.593 --> 40:29.495
I would really appreciate that.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.196
-To be honest...
-You know what, I'll try.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.430
Thank you very much.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.867
-Yup, just got a
new case of red wine.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.532
What happened?

41:11.537 --> 41:12.904
Supergirl stopped me.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.842
She had friends
I didn't expect.

41:17.543 --> 41:18.610
You have friends, too.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.747
What do you mean?

41:22.648 --> 41:24.650
There are others like you.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.220
Why didn't you tell me?

41:29.621 --> 41:31.790
You hadn't proven yourself.

41:33.692 --> 41:34.960
But now you have.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.730
You just need to know
how to find them.

41:38.764 --> 41:41.567
I can help you with the path.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.670
El-may-arah.

41:44.703 --> 41:45.937
Stronger together.
