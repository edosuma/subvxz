00:37.689 --> 00:41.345
You've got people
who see something.

00:47.308 --> 00:51.660
It can create
instantaneous ramping

00:51.834 --> 00:54.097
of fear, frenzy, concern,
in a community.

00:59.537 --> 01:02.801
You typically would see
that kind of situation

01:02.975 --> 01:05.543
around serial rape,
serial murders.

01:11.375 --> 01:15.684
I can tell you that it creates
grave concerns on our part

01:15.945 --> 01:18.774
because what we don't want
is people to be

01:19.035 --> 01:22.691
subsequently injured
in an assault, or murdered.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.786
Where somebody claims
that they felt threatened,

01:30.960 --> 01:33.136
or this frenzy just kinda
takes over

01:33.354 --> 01:34.833
and people start
behaving in ways

01:35.007 --> 01:37.314
that they would
not otherwise behave.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.818
Oh, my God.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.820
I didn't know
this was really real.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.755
Then why did you hide
under that girl's bed

04:17.779 --> 04:19.128
that one time?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.702
I know you really don't kill,

04:20.869 --> 04:22.566
you just show up
at people's houses.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.743
Hi, Wrinkles.
This is NBC 2 in Fort Myers.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.355
We're just seeing your story
really blow up online.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.058
Meet Southwest Florida's
Wrinkles the Clown.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.103
A creepy clown named Wrinkles

04:38.278 --> 04:40.889
offered to terrorize
naughty children for cash.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.109
Hi, I have a child
that's misbehaving pretty bad.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.068
If you give me a call back at...

04:46.242 --> 04:48.592
You can't miss his red
and white polka dot suit.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.135
Hi, Wrinkles, I'm a reporter

04:50.159 --> 04:51.291
at the Washington Post.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.162
I was hoping to interview you

04:53.336 --> 04:56.426
for a story about your, uh...
your amazingness.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.255
I found this guy named
Wrinkles the Clown.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.432
And he's a guy on Craigslist
who you can call,

05:02.606 --> 05:04.739
and apparently, he'll come
to your address

05:04.913 --> 05:06.175
and scare children.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.709
He makes me think
I'm going to die.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.808
Hello, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.747
No, I'm not here
to take your call.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.604
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.513
Wrinkles, I'm a reporter

05:20.537 --> 05:22.147
at the Naples Daily News.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.386
You're scaring little people

05:23.410 --> 05:24.889
that can't defend themselves.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.606
Could have been
a child molester.

05:26.630 --> 05:27.651
I've never seen you
in real life,

05:27.675 --> 05:29.590
but I love your YouTube videos.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.636
I'm so excited to leave
this message for you.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.377
Please call me back.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.206
Wrinkles is easily
and often spotted around town.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.903
Here he is
in Downtown Fort Myers

05:39.077 --> 05:40.383
and it's the Collier
County fair.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.343
Hey, Wrinkles.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.495
Was writing a story about you
and I was interested in that

05:45.519 --> 05:47.085
thing you had with
that little girl

05:47.303 --> 05:48.870
that was on YouTube.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.500
If you haven't seen this video,

05:50.524 --> 05:51.916
good luck going
to sleep tonight.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.703
I mean, seriously.

05:55.877 --> 06:00.316
He was lurking under the bed
of a sleeping little girl.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.902
He goes by Wrinkles,
but you may know him

06:01.926 --> 06:03.406
by his other name,
Person of Interest.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.365
Uh...

06:05.582 --> 06:07.622
I'm calling from CAA
which is a talent agency

06:07.671 --> 06:10.195
- in Los Angeles.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

06:10.370 --> 06:12.763
Hey Wrinkles,
are you hiding in my friend's backyard,

06:12.937 --> 06:14.567
because we saw a clown
that looks exactly like you.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.151
This is the County Sheriff's
Department.

06:16.332 --> 06:17.855
I just wanted to call you
to verify

06:18.029 --> 06:19.869
that you're not allowed
out on Halloween night.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.729
If you are found or seen
by any kids,

06:21.946 --> 06:23.906
you'll be arrested on site.-

06:26.603 --> 06:28.163
Is that Wrinkles the Clown?

06:28.910 --> 06:29.954
No!

06:30.128 --> 06:31.391
Let me take a picture with him.

06:32.653 --> 06:33.653
Come on, man.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.314
Dude, he's a legend.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.229
What the fuck?

06:44.621 --> 06:46.797
Wrinkles walks by
and the whole thing.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.497
What I saw was like a little
flyer or pamphlet on a post

06:50.671 --> 06:52.271
and I was walking home
from work one day,

06:52.542 --> 06:54.128
and it had him, and his name,
and his number, and I was like,

06:54.152 --> 06:55.872
"Dude, I'm gonna try
to call this, you know,

06:56.024 --> 06:57.697
phone number, get a hold of him,"
it goes right to his voicemail.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.264
I'm like... so I call him over
and over again,

06:59.288 --> 07:01.088
he finally picked up.
It was the coolest thing

07:01.246 --> 07:03.006
'cause it was, you know,
actually him saying,

07:03.031 --> 07:05.009
- "Hey, what's going on?"
- I love what he's doing.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.863
It brings a spark, an energy,
to the neighborhood.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.821
And... how many times

07:10.995 --> 07:13.433
do we bring it up
to people alone, you know?

07:13.607 --> 07:17.001
Just be afraid of this.
You can't be afraid of Jason.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.568
It's fiction.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.962
You can't be afraid of,
you know, that Carrie,

07:21.179 --> 07:22.746
but you better be afraid
of Wrinkles.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.245
- He's real.
- Wrinkles, it's like...

07:24.269 --> 07:25.836
That's been awesome. He's real.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.191
Hi, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.107
I'm not here to take your call.
Leave me a message

07:36.281 --> 07:38.675
and I'll call ya back.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.939
Wrinkles, this is Jack's father.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.656
You got to see me.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.421
He's been acting up.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.619
- Daddy.
- If they don't stop

07:49.643 --> 07:51.253
acting up, I'm gonna give you my address

07:51.427 --> 07:53.057
to come and get these little
motherfuckers.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.299
No!

07:54.778 --> 07:55.344
Do you wanna see
what he looks like?

07:55.518 --> 07:56.737
No.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.394
Look, this is what he look like.

07:58.652 --> 08:01.089
- No!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.918
My kids' names
are Angelina and Mia.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.746
Please just calm down, Mia.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.443
He says he needs the TV.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.532
He thinks he'll come out
this motherfuckin' TV.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.753
Hey, um, Wrinkle,
I need you to come get these badass kids

08:12.927 --> 08:16.060
- like I'm...
- No!

08:32.033 --> 08:33.121
Oh, it's fine.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.037
He's been like a madman.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.996
Personal vengeance and shame
they are.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.173
However, uh, did you have
much trouble getting here?

08:49.311 --> 08:51.487
Just hold your breath.
If it is right...

08:56.274 --> 08:57.774
You know, uh,
I'll probably never

08:57.798 --> 08:59.800
unmask myself.
I don't wanna be hassled.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.604
I get hassled enough
with the phone calls,

09:01.628 --> 09:02.672
things like that.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.085
I don't need kids recognizing me
on the street, you know.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.069
I'm not going to talk you
in my real voice either.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.654
You want Wrinkles, you're gonna
get Wrinkles,

09:08.678 --> 09:09.878
you know, including the voice.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.887
But we'll not attack again,

09:14.249 --> 09:15.642
unless there's...

09:16.077 --> 09:17.881
- You're not.
- I get...

09:17.905 --> 09:19.578
I get hundreds and hundreds
of voicemails a day.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.256
The whole viral thing
for me is, uh...

09:21.430 --> 09:22.953
It's kind of a pain in the ass.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.583
Everybody and their
fucking grandmother

09:24.607 --> 09:27.262
has my phone number.
Jesus Christ.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.221
Uh, I get moms and dads that
call and ask whose number

09:30.439 --> 09:33.573
this is 'cause they see the
number in the kids' phone,

09:33.747 --> 09:35.662
and they wanna know who it is,
you know.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.794
Uh, you get kids that call
and are like,

09:38.055 --> 09:40.144
"Hey, we love you, Wrinkles"
and all that good stuff.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.669
Then you got your legit parents
out there that really are

09:42.886 --> 09:45.019
looking for some, uh,
behavioral services.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.260
My favorite kind
of scares are the ones

09:49.284 --> 09:50.502
that pay the most.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.395
You know, I'll show up outside
in the backyard, you know,

09:53.505 --> 09:55.899
maybe give a knock on the window
and, you know, make sure

09:56.073 --> 09:58.336
they see me and give them
a wave, but, you know,

09:58.510 --> 10:00.512
I'm not wielding, uh,
knives and machetes,

10:00.687 --> 10:03.864
and things like that.
I give the parents my sticker,

10:04.038 --> 10:06.238
I say, "Oh, you put the
sticker up here in the fridge."

10:06.475 --> 10:07.998
Maybe tell them, "Hey",

10:08.172 --> 10:09.933
you misbehave again,
Wrinkles is gonna come back.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.195
There's his phone number
right now,

10:11.219 --> 10:12.263
"I'll call him right now."

10:13.613 --> 10:15.571
Hi, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.476
Leave me a message
and I'll call ya back.

10:19.531 --> 10:20.837
No, Daddy.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.492
- Hello, Wrinkles?
- No. No!

10:23.666 --> 10:25.233
I'm... Let me call you back.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.277
I'mma call you back
because I think she's trying

10:26.451 --> 10:27.496
to act right now.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.953
But if she doesn't act
right, I'll give you...

10:29.977 --> 10:30.804
Hey, Wrinkles,
just calling to let you know.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.327
Kaila being bad in the store.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.982
She's running around
and everything. Yeah.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.092
Okay. I want you
to come get her for a minute

10:39.116 --> 10:41.031
or do something
'cause she's being bad.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.860
There you go. Hang on.
You got it?

10:44.034 --> 10:45.166
And I want you to eat her.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.081
- Kaila?
- Hmm?

10:47.255 --> 10:49.605
Can you tell me, um,
tell me what Wrinkle...

10:49.779 --> 10:51.433
how Wrinkle the Clown
sound to you?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.176
He was like, "Oh, Kaila",

10:55.350 --> 10:57.918
I'm gonna eat you
if you'll be bad."

11:00.311 --> 11:01.549
Oh, I bring...
you want me to bring you

11:01.573 --> 11:02.836
to her when I see you?

11:03.837 --> 11:04.837
All right.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.362
Yeah. 'Cause she's
being bad, Wrinkles.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.277
Yeah.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.759
There you go. Good job.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.632
I'm scared of Wrinkles
the Clown. He come to my house

11:16.850 --> 11:19.853
and scare me at night
if I be asleep.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.482
Oh, yeah?
But what if you're good?

11:21.506 --> 11:24.379
- What happens?
- He don't come and visit me

11:24.553 --> 11:27.077
if I be bad... if I be good.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.255
If you're good,
he doesn't come to visit?

11:29.601 --> 11:30.777
Oh, okay.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.780
I don't see that
that's child abuse.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.912
They're gonna try
and push the limit

11:36.130 --> 11:38.610
the older that they get
and so that's basically

11:38.785 --> 11:42.092
just a boundary saying, um,
you can go this far,

11:42.266 --> 11:43.746
just don't cross that line.

11:44.007 --> 11:48.533
They said they're gonna eat me
and they said, "no."

11:48.751 --> 11:50.187
Oh, okay.

11:52.537 --> 11:55.323
I think he did it to
actually become some type

11:55.497 --> 11:58.021
of contributor to society,
giving parents another way

11:58.456 --> 12:02.199
to discipline the kid and
bring them in line early.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.790
"Skype can't connect
to your webcam."

12:07.814 --> 12:09.467
I don't have a webcam.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.361
Hey, Dad, I'm doing
the interview right now.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.124
I'm doing the interview
right now.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.561
Yeah, I could see where people
would hire Wrinkles,

12:16.736 --> 12:18.694
especially if their children
are being naughty.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.914
I'm not naughty,
you're scaring me.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.267
I would definitely hire Wrinkles
to scare somebody

12:26.920 --> 12:29.444
because I'm a terrible person,
man.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.968
I know where the gun is, okay?
And I will...

12:32.447 --> 12:35.319
If he shows up to my room
at 3:00 a.m...

12:35.667 --> 12:37.210
Eadie, you're gonna get me
arrested here.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.994
He went in the bathroom,
he got toilet paper.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.935
He was just throwing it
all around the house

12:42.109 --> 12:43.240
so I called the number.

12:43.588 --> 12:46.896
And Wrink... The voicemail
picked up again,

12:47.157 --> 12:49.899
and when we heard the laugh,
he lost his mind.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.988
I promise, he lost his mind.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.861
He just started crying and he...
I promise he didn't move

12:55.035 --> 12:57.602
for about, I think,
like, two hours.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.256
He didn't move for,
like, two hours.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.041
Okay.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.758
Hey, Wrinkles the Clown.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.350
Stop.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.459
Kaila's being bad.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.443
I need you to come get her
'cause she's being bad.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.011
- Stop calling him.
- Don't be bad then.

13:16.796 --> 13:21.104
Hi, Wrinkles, there's
this very bad child...

13:21.322 --> 13:23.193
Jordan,

13:23.367 --> 13:24.780
and I was just wondering
if you could give me

13:24.804 --> 13:25.804
a call back.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.895
You hear this? This is Wrinkles.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.682
So misguided.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.728
My name is George Holden.
I'm a professor

13:36.903 --> 13:40.167
and Chair of Psychology
at Southern Methodist University

13:40.645 --> 13:42.517
and I'm a developmental
psychologist.

13:42.691 --> 13:46.608
I study parent-child
relationships, family violence,

13:46.782 --> 13:48.392
parents' use of discipline.

13:49.002 --> 13:53.702
This idea of calling Wrinkles
the Clown is really misguided.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.270
If it's done frequently enough,
it's...

13:56.444 --> 13:58.620
If it's a pattern of behavior,
in this case,

13:58.794 --> 14:00.622
we're talking
about terrorizing a child,

14:00.970 --> 14:02.015
that is...

14:02.580 --> 14:06.367
currently accepted
as one manifestation

14:06.541 --> 14:09.936
of psychological maltreatment,
which is a form of child abuse.

14:10.980 --> 14:14.766
I found out about Wrinkles the
Clown through a news story.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.769
To me, it's sad that he
couldn't come up with

14:17.944 --> 14:21.034
a more positive approach.

14:21.338 --> 14:24.167
He doesn't actually have
to travel into a home

14:24.341 --> 14:26.778
but that threat can still be,
at least for kids,

14:26.953 --> 14:29.129
as powerful as the real thing.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.828
Oh, so you're
hyper now, Mrs. Want to, um...

14:33.002 --> 14:34.917
play with the ducks.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.059
Oh, they running over here.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.937
- Here I come with some food!
- Throw it in there.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.793
I definitely would use Wrinkles

14:47.887 --> 14:50.411
one hundred percent of the time
over spankings.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.501
Spankings, uh...
That kind of leaves a mark...

14:53.718 --> 14:56.373
you know,
and so the phone, um,

14:56.547 --> 14:59.768
it's a voice. And it kinda
leaves the, um,

14:59.942 --> 15:03.424
scary option of, "if I'm bad,
then I got to hear this voice,"

15:03.903 --> 15:05.687
and she doesn't wanna hear
the voice.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.915
When I was a kid,
you got the fucking belt.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.568
You know, my dad was old school.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.353
He would go hard on you,
you know?

15:19.527 --> 15:20.896
He cared about us
and he didn't want us

15:20.920 --> 15:22.356
to get in trouble, so...

15:22.530 --> 15:24.464
Now, it's like, you know,
you can't hit your kids,

15:24.488 --> 15:26.186
you can't do this,
you'll go to jail.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.102
So, you know, they're using
psychological warfare,

15:29.276 --> 15:31.669
things like that, you know?
They're using what's available.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.455
And is that as harmful
as spanking your kid

15:34.629 --> 15:35.954
with a belt, you know?
I don't know.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.458
It's up to you,
you're the parent.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.264
I've been asked before

15:43.290 --> 15:45.553
if I feel guilty
about the parents

15:45.727 --> 15:47.642
that wanna use me
for behavioral services.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.340
You know, that's a contract
between me and mom and dad.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.300
That's nobody else's business,
so you got a problem with it,

15:53.474 --> 15:54.874
you can take it up
with mom and dad,

15:54.954 --> 15:56.259
'cause I'm just doing my job.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.381
Why are you stalking
little kids?

16:36.821 --> 16:38.475
Oh, here. I have an idea.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.523
Is this good?

16:42.871 --> 16:45.961
Um, what I wanna do
when I'm older is

16:46.135 --> 16:50.009
I wanna be a professional
animal trainer.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.404
So, this is my dog Schnitzel.
He is a schnauzer mix.

16:54.578 --> 16:57.494
And then this is
my mom's dog, Gracey.

16:58.147 --> 17:01.498
Her owners died and no one
really knows how,

17:01.672 --> 17:03.674
not even, like, police
or anything.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.467
Okay. So, I just wanted
to try to call clowns

17:13.641 --> 17:15.164
just to see, like,
what would happen

17:15.338 --> 17:16.773
and I didn't get in trouble
for it

17:16.948 --> 17:18.428
but my parents were like,

17:18.689 --> 17:20.569
"Why are you calling a
clown?" and I was, like,

17:20.604 --> 17:22.476
"Well, Wrinkles sounds more real

17:22.650 --> 17:24.042
than what I've seen on YouTube."

17:24.913 --> 17:28.002
I was like, "Don't be looking up
numbers online",

17:28.482 --> 17:31.354
don't be calling random people.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.878
Don't... You don't even know
if this is...

17:34.488 --> 17:36.707
Access to this stuff is scary

17:36.881 --> 17:38.424
'cause you don't know
what they're getting into.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.146
You try to keep an eye on it
and try to...

17:40.624 --> 17:42.713
But you can't govern all of it

17:42.931 --> 17:45.151
and so you just kinda
have to hope that you've...

17:45.412 --> 17:46.935
you know, that they have
a good sense

17:47.109 --> 17:49.459
of what's good and not.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.767
And yet you got children
who otherwise wouldn't even care

17:52.941 --> 17:55.030
about clowns except
now scary clowns are cool

17:55.204 --> 17:59.252
and so he goes clown crazy
sometimes.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.080
Hey, Wrinkles,

18:01.341 --> 18:03.517
I love clowns,
I love everything.

18:04.039 --> 18:07.260
Clowns inspire me.
Um, call me back,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.392
leave me a message,
text me, anything.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.264
I'm making a YouTube video.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.308
Bye.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.893
If I hired Wrinkles,
once my kid fell asleep,

18:32.415 --> 18:33.851
I would make him
hide under here,

18:34.025 --> 18:35.897
and I would like
make him bang stuff,

18:36.071 --> 18:38.378
like under here, and, like,
make him, like,

18:38.639 --> 18:40.902
get fr...
like, freaked out a little bit.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.384
And then.. And then
once they fall asleep again,

18:44.732 --> 18:48.083
like, I would have him,
like, come out like this,

18:48.257 --> 18:49.519
and I'd have him go...

18:50.433 --> 18:51.913
Like that maybe.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.524
And, like... Just, like,
try to mess with him even more.

18:55.046 --> 18:58.528
And... And then once
they fell asleep again,

18:58.702 --> 18:59.964
I would have him go like this.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.847
I think some people
sometimes need to be scared,

19:13.108 --> 19:14.762
every once in a while.

19:15.066 --> 19:19.114
Just, like, some people,
if they're, like,

19:19.288 --> 19:22.248
really sad or something,
you can just try to scare 'em,

19:22.422 --> 19:27.427
and it'll just make 'em like,
I guess, a little happier.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.865
Like, if I'm home alone
watching creepy videos

19:31.039 --> 19:32.693
and I get scared,
I kinda like it.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.695
Like, it'll start feeling
real to me

19:34.869 --> 19:37.480
like there's something else
creepy happening, like,

19:38.307 --> 19:40.024
- in the room with me.
- And Slenderman!

19:40.048 --> 19:41.048
What are you doing?

19:41.397 --> 19:42.920
Slenderman!

19:43.312 --> 19:45.116
- Okay. Stop.
- Slenderman! Slenderman!

19:45.140 --> 19:47.534
I just felt something behind me.

19:47.751 --> 19:48.926
Okay. Okay.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.758
I know that Slenderman
is real. I know that he is.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.195
Folklore is an outlet

19:56.369 --> 19:58.022
for connecting
with other people.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.200
The superstitions they believe,
the legends that they tell.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.940
Folklorists,
and myself included,

20:03.114 --> 20:06.509
find this to be richly evocative
of what culture is.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.125
Dude.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.999
We have to just put rice in it.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.870
We have to cut it
and then put rice.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.350
And put it with the knife.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.875
Shit. Okay. Tag you're it,
tag you're it, tag you're it.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.487
Diablo, you're it.
Diablo, you're it.

20:27.661 --> 20:31.099
Go! Go, go, go, go!

20:32.100 --> 20:33.904
One of the things
that happens with legends

20:33.928 --> 20:36.017
is we try to verify
that they're real or not.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.022
Charlie, Charlie, can we play?
Charlie, Charlie can we...

20:42.980 --> 20:46.114
Online, we see that kids
are propelling the transmission

20:46.288 --> 20:48.682
of folklore in a very,
very rapid succession,

20:48.856 --> 20:50.858
in ways that were
not previously done before.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.947
Devil. Devil.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.210
Devil.

20:55.689 --> 20:56.690
Devil.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.363
- Devil.
- Play it again.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.651
Folklore provides
an opportunity for us

21:01.825 --> 21:05.655
to perform and test out ideas
to experiment with something

21:05.829 --> 21:07.527
- that is scary...
- I'm so scared.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.679
What if we go missing
and they play this on the news

21:09.703 --> 21:11.400
- the next day?
- And play with that

21:11.792 --> 21:15.099
to test the boundaries
of safety.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.667
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.800
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

21:19.974 --> 21:24.021
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.609
Hi, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown,

21:37.818 --> 21:39.472
but I'm not here
to take your call.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.517
Leave me a message
and I'll call ya back.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.583
I'm getting the fuck
out of here.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.873
- Um...
- No!

21:50.134 --> 21:51.875
Ooh, try it again, try it again.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.539
Hi, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown,

21:54.704 --> 21:56.576
but I'm not here
to take your call.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.750
Did you hear that?

21:58.839 --> 21:59.883
That was creepy.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.060
Now that's Wrinkles the Clown.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.353
Should we show them
the phone number?

22:05.454 --> 22:06.953
Wait. Everyone, be quiet.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.936
- 4-0-7...
- 7-3-4...

22:09.153 --> 22:12.809
0-2-5-4. Call that number.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.637
Now.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.247
I'm going to call Wrinkles.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.293
He's gonna eat us.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.665
What makes Wrinkles
the Clown significant

22:22.689 --> 22:24.473
as an example
of digital folklore

22:24.647 --> 22:27.694
is how people have responded
to his phone number,

22:27.955 --> 22:32.351
uh, and have made kind
of a ritual out of calling him.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.918
And videos documenting
the proof of actually

22:35.136 --> 22:37.878
contacting Wrinkles
is part of the performance.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.488
It's a part of the ritual.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.423
Hi, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown,

22:41.447 --> 22:42.970
but I'm not here
to take your call.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.962
Leave me a message
and I'll call ya back.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.977
- What the heck?
- Dude, that's scary.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.675
Yeah. I told you. I told you.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.255
- Bye, Mr. Wrinkle.
- It went straight to voicemail.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.650
- Oh. Well, he's there at least.
- Wait. Wait, wait.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.237
Hi, you've reached
Wrinkles the Clown,

23:13.261 --> 23:14.654
but I'm not...

23:14.828 --> 23:16.327
He... He put it to voice...

23:16.351 --> 23:18.440
He just turned off
the phone completely.

23:19.006 --> 23:22.662
Oh, yeah. Let me go in here
and turn off the TV.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.840
This is where I do
all my videos.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.450
I should have just gone in here.

23:28.668 --> 23:31.279
For fun, I like to watch videos
and make videos

23:31.453 --> 23:32.454
on my YouTube channel.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.718
What I like about YouTube
is you can be creative

23:35.892 --> 23:38.242
and you can do what you want
and not have to

23:38.460 --> 23:39.940
do what anybody else wants.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.730
Me and my sister were
watching YouTube videos,

23:47.904 --> 23:49.819
and we came across
Wrinkles the Clown.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.387
And so we started
doing research on him

23:52.692 --> 23:55.434
and then we just
called him for a video.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.523
We're like, "What if he answers?"

23:57.697 --> 24:00.221
And what if he's gonna be
real creepy?

24:00.395 --> 24:02.702
What if he's gonna
start threatening us?

24:02.876 --> 24:06.096
"What if he just can't take
getting called like that?"

24:06.706 --> 24:09.535
And we're sitting there, like,
"We shouldn't have done this."

24:16.019 --> 24:18.239
It feels like a horror movie
when you see someone...

24:18.413 --> 24:19.762
something's about to happen.

24:25.072 --> 24:28.075
After I saw the video,
I felt paranoid.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.208
And I had a nightmare, and like,
there was clowns in my house,

24:31.382 --> 24:33.515
and, like, you couldn't see
them, but you could see

24:33.689 --> 24:37.171
a shadow of them walk by
and it was, like, very creepy.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.087
And it made me, like,
very scared.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.481
I took out my box spring.

24:42.742 --> 24:46.180
I slept just on the floor
on my mattress and everything.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.399
I didn't want anything
underneath my bed

24:48.574 --> 24:50.619
because I just don't wanna
wake up in the middle

24:50.837 --> 24:54.362
of the night and there be
a clown sitting there,

24:54.797 --> 24:57.408
and I don't wanna...
start screaming.

24:58.235 --> 25:01.021
We ordered boxes
and I put it in my closet

25:01.674 --> 25:04.372
just so nothing could get
in my closet,

25:04.807 --> 25:07.767
nothing could be under my bed.
I just felt more safe.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.030
And locked my windows.

25:10.900 --> 25:16.166
It kinda sucks to not be able
to feel safe at your own house.

25:30.224 --> 25:33.357
Hello, Wrinkles.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.100
I need you to come to my house
and kidnap a little girl.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.952
What did we do to deserve this?

26:21.928 --> 26:23.843
Scaring kids, scaring people...

26:24.017 --> 26:25.647
I don't know what kind
of parents would do that.

26:25.671 --> 26:26.889
No parent I know.

26:27.194 --> 26:30.458
Talcum powder,
put it in a sock to set...

26:31.851 --> 26:34.201
'cause you wanna be matte,
you don't wanna be shiny.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.421
Real clowning is putting on
greasepaint makeup...

26:38.814 --> 26:40.381
putting the money
into the costumes,

26:40.555 --> 26:42.475
into your craft,
having the right kind of heart,

26:42.644 --> 26:45.081
and your goal is
to make people smile.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.474
Make people laugh.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.432
That's a lot harder
than scaring people.

26:50.652 --> 26:54.525
Now, a circus clown
likes to have a full half hour

26:54.700 --> 26:55.962
for putting it on his face.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.051
The sort of default clown

26:58.268 --> 26:59.550
that most Americans
are familiar with

26:59.574 --> 27:01.010
is the happy clown.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.115
And this is because of,
like, Bozo the Clown.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.319
The Happy Birthday Clown.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.061
We love the trickster figure.
We love the figure

27:08.235 --> 27:09.889
that makes us think
and makes us laugh

27:10.063 --> 27:11.412
and maybe embarrasses us.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.849
These clowns
are trying out a new act.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.547
Historically,
clowns operated in silence.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.115
And part of that goes back
to their nature

27:19.289 --> 27:20.551
and their role in the circus.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.337
They're exaggerated.
They're over the top.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.555
They're hyper human.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.445
They can do these weird, bizarre

27:26.601 --> 27:28.472
seemingly supernatural things.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.692
We know that there's
a human underneath

27:30.910 --> 27:32.955
the greasepaint and the wig
and whatever else,

27:33.564 --> 27:36.480
and yet, there's something
unnatural about them,

27:36.655 --> 27:38.004
something inhuman.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.244
On one hand, they're
presenting themselves

27:41.268 --> 27:43.923
to the public as happy
and goofy.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.535
On the other hand, of course,
we know that that's an act.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.711
You don't know their identity,

27:49.885 --> 27:51.428
you don't know what
their intentions are,

27:51.452 --> 27:52.516
you don't know what
they're gonna do

27:52.540 --> 27:53.846
and that creeps people out.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.540
When you add in the access
to children,

27:55.630 --> 27:57.197
that just amps it up.

27:57.414 --> 28:00.591
Did you like that?
Oh, heart is just going wild.

28:00.809 --> 28:02.376
I do have a fear of clowns.

28:02.550 --> 28:05.074
I do have coulrophobia
which is the fear of clowns.

28:05.553 --> 28:09.209
Their face is painted
and it's scary, like,

28:09.383 --> 28:10.601
what are you gonna do?

28:11.124 --> 28:13.284
You remember when I dressed up
as a clown to scare you?

28:13.387 --> 28:15.824
- No.
- Well, I do. And you screamed

28:15.998 --> 28:17.913
and fell backwards,
and laid there.

28:20.089 --> 28:22.329
It's a mistake to ask
"When did clowns go bad?"

28:22.396 --> 28:24.398
because the evil side
has always been there.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.401
One of the most famous
evil clowns historically

28:27.575 --> 28:29.882
is Mr. Punch, the star
of The Punch and Judy shows,

28:30.056 --> 28:32.841
which have been popular
in England for centuries.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.844
These two puppets are just
nasty, and abusive,

28:36.018 --> 28:39.152
and vile, and homicidal.

28:39.413 --> 28:42.503
And it's a kid show.
And kids love it!

28:43.069 --> 28:44.592
So when you see
these evil clowns

28:44.766 --> 28:46.725
come out in culture,
in pop culture, in movies,

28:46.899 --> 28:49.259
and films, and things like that,
it's really hearkening back

28:49.423 --> 28:52.382
to a more genuine part
of the clown.

28:53.427 --> 28:54.428
You can call me...

28:55.516 --> 28:57.605
Joker.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.609
No!

29:15.797 --> 29:17.517
Man down!

29:22.325 --> 29:24.980
And when you're down here

29:25.633 --> 29:29.419
with me, you'll float too.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.642
You'll float, too!

29:38.602 --> 29:41.083
Today, I just came
from face painting at a party,

29:41.301 --> 29:43.651
and like six of the boys
wanted to be Pennywise.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.263
There's a whole generation
growing up

29:48.090 --> 29:50.614
with no positive image
of a clown whatsoever.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.183
I go to a party,
I make people laugh

29:54.357 --> 29:55.881
and I make cool stuff like this.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.935
And get bunch of kids
walking around with these.

29:58.927 --> 30:02.061
3-D!

30:02.931 --> 30:04.280
Cool.

30:04.715 --> 30:08.415
Slap on a mask, you have
this empowerment to make people

30:08.632 --> 30:11.461
react to you, you know?
And that's a powerful thing.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.552
You know. But that's
what terrorism is.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.773
Real clowns are not scary.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.343
John Gacy,

30:23.952 --> 30:25.364
a man who liked to put on
a clown suit

30:25.388 --> 30:26.825
and entertain children.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.870
Now, he is charged
with one murder...

30:29.044 --> 30:31.220
and the police have found,
at last count,

30:31.481 --> 30:34.833
27 bodies buried
under his house and garage

30:35.050 --> 30:36.835
and two more in a nearby river.

30:43.406 --> 30:46.496
In the 1980s,
soon after John Wayne Gacy,

30:46.714 --> 30:49.760
rumors and stories circulated
that there were clowns,

30:49.935 --> 30:51.719
often groups of them
in white vans,

30:52.459 --> 30:54.809
that were circling around
trying to abduct kids.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.507
And it spread.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.121
In each case you had
these rumors

31:02.295 --> 31:04.210
in the school districts,
in the communities

31:04.384 --> 31:06.560
often shared in the news media

31:06.734 --> 31:09.824
and by parents who would
call, panicked.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.307
A van of clowns trying
to abduct kids?

31:14.568 --> 31:15.961
Of course you're gonna
freak out.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.223
Who wouldn't freak out?

31:44.337 --> 31:46.078
I started off Wrinkles The Clown

31:46.252 --> 31:49.081
just as, you know, something
to keep me occupied

31:49.255 --> 31:50.734
as, you know, retired
and whatnot.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.697
You know, I did the face
makeup and everything,

31:56.871 --> 31:58.711
but after a while,
especially living down here,

31:58.742 --> 32:00.179
the face makeup,
it just melts off.

32:08.535 --> 32:11.146
You know, no one was hiring me
when I was just a regular clown.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.560
I just thought, yeah, you know,

32:12.669 --> 32:14.062
maybe I'll give it
a little edge.

32:15.281 --> 32:17.259
Something different.
All these clowns are the same,

32:17.283 --> 32:18.414
it's kind of boring.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.688
Saw this one mask on eBay and...

32:32.124 --> 32:33.884
I don't know, I just liked
the way it looked.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.755
Looked, uh...
It was somewhere between, like,

32:35.910 --> 32:38.086
Michael Myers
and my grandfather.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.890
And I was like, "Hey,
that's pretty funny."

32:39.914 --> 32:42.264
It's kind of creepy, it's kinda
got everything I need."

32:42.438 --> 32:44.005
So I gave it a try.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.924
I'm outside. I had
to come tell my mama

32:50.098 --> 32:51.534
that it powered off.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.406
I'm a comedian

32:53.754 --> 32:57.279
and I can make people laugh
very easily.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.281
I can do a funny face.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.682
When I was eight years old,

33:08.943 --> 33:10.945
I first heard about Wrinkles

33:11.119 --> 33:14.209
and I was, like,
very freaked out.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.212
I was kind of scared

33:17.386 --> 33:19.606
that he would come
to my house or something.

33:19.954 --> 33:20.954
Wrinkles.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.001
What you want, bruh?

33:23.392 --> 33:24.741
Do you wanna fight?

33:25.438 --> 33:27.005
Come over to Georgia, okay?

33:28.223 --> 33:29.703
- Mom?
- Yeah?

33:30.182 --> 33:31.724
And I'm
not telling you my address

33:31.748 --> 33:33.837
so you might as well
find my address.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.361
I have a mama...

33:36.840 --> 33:37.840
that's crippled...

33:39.060 --> 33:40.583
but I can still fight back.

33:41.323 --> 33:44.239
I have a dog that's named Halo.
Where is she?

33:44.413 --> 33:45.893
Rena, hang the phone up.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.204
Don't you make me drop you.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.122
Fiona, can I borrow some
of your cat food? Okay.

34:07.741 --> 34:08.916
Good girl.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.440
What you gonna do?

34:12.092 --> 34:14.313
'Cause who cares about you?

34:14.487 --> 34:16.445
You need to be in jail
right now.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.899
Say something.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.351
Quit messing
with these children.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.105
Stop. I'm about to come up there

34:24.322 --> 34:26.150
and whoop your ass right now.

34:27.587 --> 34:28.891
I'm sorry.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.330
Because who cares about you?

34:31.808 --> 34:35.681
I care about God and you care
about the devil or something?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.987
Yes, he does.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.521
- I said the "A" word.
- You can say I am,

34:40.600 --> 34:42.317
- but I'm not...
- Well, I had no idea

34:42.341 --> 34:45.387
that she was talking
to actual Wrinkles, you know.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.781
I wasn't talking to him.
I left a voicemail.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.043
Yeah.

34:49.696 --> 34:52.481
I'm scared about another
cuss word or something.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.089
Well, they've already heard it.

34:55.614 --> 34:58.139
That's just crazy. It's funny.

34:58.357 --> 34:59.749
But, uh...

34:59.923 --> 35:02.491
Yeah, at that time,
I remember last year.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.973
Clowns are meant to be,
you know, funny,

35:06.234 --> 35:10.717
uh, running around the rodeos,
and acting a fool,

35:10.934 --> 35:13.807
and at birthday parties.
Honk, honk, honk, honk.

35:14.024 --> 35:17.115
- Honk.
- Not out trying to hurt people.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.945
Scaring children.
They could grow up...

35:23.208 --> 35:25.427
being traumatized
by something like that.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.083
Not only liking clowns, but just

35:29.257 --> 35:33.348
- not trusting people and stuff.
- I need to grab me something.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.621
I just had a nightmare
last night.

35:45.795 --> 35:46.795
Hello.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.451
My dad got...

35:51.149 --> 35:55.240
killed by Wrinkles and he, like,
locked him up

35:55.414 --> 35:57.720
in a basement or something.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.725
If I would have found him,
I'm for real...

36:03.770 --> 36:07.121
I'll see how he likes it
in the basement.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.081
Hi, baby.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.350
I've been trying to get her
to lay on her back.

36:25.574 --> 36:26.574
There she goes.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.578
She was laying on her back.

36:31.145 --> 36:35.149
I also think Wrinkles wants
to have fun...

36:37.064 --> 36:38.196
but it's not working...

36:40.110 --> 36:42.809
because he's killing kids.

36:48.075 --> 36:50.686
He took a little kid home
and killed him...

36:53.994 --> 36:58.781
and probably made artwork
with blood all over the wall.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.444
No.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.466
I'm here.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.571
Well, Florida's just
basically a fucking giant swamp

37:46.742 --> 37:48.788
with houses, you know,
like, just strung about,

37:49.092 --> 37:51.094
a lot of shopping,
a lot of, uh...

37:51.269 --> 37:53.314
a lot of stores
that nobody needs.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.610
Yeah, it's beautiful,
don't get me wrong,

37:55.751 --> 37:57.797
but it's just, you know,
I'm not doing the golf

37:57.971 --> 37:59.755
and, you know, going
to the country club

37:59.929 --> 38:02.038
and things like that, you know.
I just... that's just...

38:02.062 --> 38:04.064
I never really fit into
that kind of lifestyle.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.150
Yeah. I don't really
do the strip club

38:27.174 --> 38:29.785
as much as I'd like to.
Costs a lot of money, you know.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.488
It gets harder and harder
as you get older.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.069
Then you start getting lonely,
you know, sometimes I dream

38:39.229 --> 38:42.015
about maybe having a girl to
settle down with, you know?

38:42.232 --> 38:44.713
What am I gonna do?
Have them come back to the van?

38:50.589 --> 38:52.309
I just wanna go out there
and have some fun,

38:52.373 --> 38:54.419
and, you know,
I'll do something different.

38:57.117 --> 38:59.293
Sometimes I go home
and I feel good about it.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.991
It's kind of rewarding
in a way, you know,

39:02.165 --> 39:04.037
and it kinda makes it worth
all the bullshit.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.258
But sometimes I can just
close my eyes in the mask

39:08.433 --> 39:09.695
and just get in my own head.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.795
She's got her excited
'cause she doesn't know.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.023
- Yeah.
- You won. That's good.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.677
- I know.
- That's...

39:35.938 --> 39:37.394
- Guys?
- No. You won

39:37.418 --> 39:38.874
- the money.
- What's outside?

39:38.898 --> 39:39.986
- What?
- Huh?

39:40.203 --> 39:41.563
There's something outside.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.771
Huh?

39:43.119 --> 39:44.793
I swear there's
something outside.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.949
- What the fuck?
- What?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.850
Oh, my God. Oh, God, God.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.783
- Stop! Do something.
- Oh, my God!

39:55.218 --> 39:58.570
Stop, stop, stop!

39:58.918 --> 40:00.963
Wait.

40:15.935 --> 40:19.155
I'd probably have
a heart attack over that.

40:26.467 --> 40:30.776
Yeah. That would scare me
to death.

40:31.037 --> 40:34.301
He was sitting on the table,
one evening, right after supper,

40:34.475 --> 40:36.235
and started calling him.
You know, I was afraid

40:36.259 --> 40:37.652
he was gonna
give him information

40:37.826 --> 40:40.176
and him come here, and,
you know,

40:40.350 --> 40:43.963
you hear all those bad stories
and... It was scary at first.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.444
Remember when I had to take out
my box spring...

40:46.705 --> 40:48.010
- Mm-hmm.
- Because I got

40:48.576 --> 40:50.467
real creeped out when I saw
the video of him coming out.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.051
- Mm-hmm.
- So we put it under your bed.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.429
If he's under your bed,
you can protect yourself.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.453
Yeah.

40:58.717 --> 41:01.067
The reason I'm not scared
of Wrinkles anymore

41:01.284 --> 41:04.374
is just I learned how to, like,
be okay with it.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.160
It's like I basically
got scared so much,

41:07.334 --> 41:08.988
I'm not scared anymore.

41:10.468 --> 41:15.168
So basically today I'm gonna
be showing you the clown mask

41:15.342 --> 41:17.022
and the little knife
that I bought with it.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.216
This is the mask. It's gonna be

41:20.521 --> 41:23.045
my Halloween costume
for next year.

41:25.831 --> 41:27.833
Daddy, how do you do this?

41:30.749 --> 41:32.248
- Oh, I know how to do it.
- Oh, yeah?

41:32.272 --> 41:33.592
I wanna do it.

41:38.104 --> 41:40.628
- It's so tight.
- Well... yeah, it is.

41:40.802 --> 41:44.153
I see your eyes bulging
through the holes.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.636
Oh, yeah. Beautiful.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.090
Before he got this mask...

41:50.246 --> 41:51.876
It's like he turns
into somebody else

41:51.900 --> 41:53.460
- when this thing's on.
- I know.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.123
I think that
when someone puts on a mask

41:57.340 --> 42:00.692
or a costume, they feel like
they can kind of

42:01.127 --> 42:04.434
just be a different person.
If there's something you wanna

42:04.652 --> 42:06.132
change about yourself,
you kinda can.

42:06.785 --> 42:09.831
Like if there's someone, like,
in my school walking around,

42:10.005 --> 42:12.225
they wouldn't know me.
I could just act like

42:12.399 --> 42:14.793
a completely different person
and they wouldn't know at all.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.360
It's hot in there.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.420
I drank a lot of it that night.

42:33.594 --> 42:35.394
The viral video
shows Robby Stratton

42:35.553 --> 42:36.913
running through
a convenience store

42:36.989 --> 42:38.556
with an alligator in his hands.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.862
He takes the animal
in the beer fridge as well.

42:41.036 --> 42:42.777
I don't even remember
coming up here.

42:42.995 --> 42:44.886
We asked Stratton
where the alligator came from.

42:44.910 --> 42:48.174
No clue. No clue.
I literally came...

42:48.348 --> 42:50.348
This Florida man
is accused of having sex

42:50.437 --> 42:53.266
with a miniature horse
on multiple occasions.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.855
He's now being held
in the Marion County Jail.

42:57.879 --> 42:59.519
I don't know what's next for me.

42:59.620 --> 43:01.840
I live day by day.
This is kind of where I'm at,

43:02.014 --> 43:03.854
this is what I got,
this what I'm working with.

43:04.277 --> 43:07.019
Um... I don't know.
I'm just kind of, uh...

43:07.193 --> 43:09.108
I'm just kind of living out
my last years.

43:10.457 --> 43:13.591
I don't know if there'll be a
Wrinkles legacy, so to speak.

43:13.765 --> 43:16.463
I think it'll just be like,
"Hey, remember that one time

43:16.637 --> 43:18.639
we called that clown?
That was scary."

43:22.121 --> 43:23.481
Yeah, Wrinkles the Clown.

43:23.992 --> 43:25.646
Sup yo, watcha you doin?

43:26.821 --> 43:27.821
Who's this?

43:29.041 --> 43:30.433
Who this? It's your mom.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.808
Oh, that's good one.

43:31.870 --> 43:32.977
I haven't heard that one
yet today.

43:33.001 --> 43:34.307
Hey, Wrinkles the Clown.

43:34.481 --> 43:35.481
Yeah?

43:37.527 --> 43:38.964
You have to scare somebody?

43:40.008 --> 43:41.288
Yeah. That's what I do.

43:44.926 --> 43:47.363
It never ends. You got
the pranks, you know,

43:47.537 --> 43:49.670
but mostly it's just
real violent stuff.

43:52.499 --> 43:53.955
Hey I'll come down
to fucking Florida

43:53.979 --> 43:55.676
and beat your old wrinkly ass.

43:55.850 --> 43:58.897
We live in a big pasture,
and my dad has guns

43:59.201 --> 44:01.421
to shoot the coyotes
but he'll shoot you instead.

44:01.595 --> 44:03.423
I will piss on you right now.

44:03.597 --> 44:05.381
I'll fucking rip your dick off

44:05.555 --> 44:07.122
and fucking make you eat it.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.342
I'll slap you
with a fucking jackhammer.

44:09.516 --> 44:11.561
Fucking Mexican Mafia
coming for your ass.

44:11.779 --> 44:13.172
We'll cut out
your tongue, bitch.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.320
And I'll stick needles
in your eyeballs

44:15.478 --> 44:17.089
and tie you to a fucking tree.

44:17.524 --> 44:19.657
And fucking chop off
your fingers and fucking...

44:20.135 --> 44:23.051
just fucking torture you,
you fucking sick bastard.

44:23.486 --> 44:26.054
I'mma fucking hang you u
like fucking Vladimir Putin.

44:26.228 --> 44:27.708
I'll take this fucking
baseball bat

44:27.926 --> 44:29.449
and beat your fucking brains in.

44:31.451 --> 44:32.887
I'mma burn your clown ass.

44:40.939 --> 44:43.158
Kill yourself,
Wrinkles the fucking clown.

44:44.986 --> 44:47.510
If Wrinkles came
to my house, I'll tell him,

44:47.685 --> 44:51.210
"I have a game for you.
We'll just stay shoulder

44:51.384 --> 44:53.473
"to shoulder," and then push you
in the water

44:53.647 --> 44:55.388
with the alligators.

45:08.140 --> 45:10.055
It's kinda disheartening to hear

45:10.229 --> 45:12.405
and it's...
But at the same time, I just...

45:12.579 --> 45:14.929
You know, it doesn't really
have an effect on me anymore.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.627
It's like you know,
I'm still kicking.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.367
No one's come to try
to kill me yet.

45:19.847 --> 45:21.936
You know, sometimes these
kids text me and like...

45:22.545 --> 45:24.852
the more I text back,
the more they're trying to call

45:25.026 --> 45:27.246
and find out more information
or... they wanna prove

45:27.420 --> 45:29.441
to their friends I'm real.
They're always asking me,

45:29.465 --> 45:32.642
"Send me a picture of yourself.
Send me a video. You're fake.

45:32.991 --> 45:34.551
You're not real. Send me a..."
You know?

45:34.644 --> 45:36.840
It doesn't really matter
who's behind the mask, you know?

45:36.864 --> 45:38.910
Like, it doesn't matter
who Wrinkles is.

45:39.084 --> 45:40.215
Wrinkles is Wrinkles.

45:44.393 --> 45:47.309
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

45:47.832 --> 45:50.704
- How is your life?
- I wanna know who you are.

45:50.878 --> 45:52.967
Who are you,
and why are you doing this?

45:53.228 --> 45:56.579
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

45:56.754 --> 45:59.626
Who are you,
and can you tell me your real name please?

45:59.800 --> 46:02.150
You're just this weird
old man probably.

46:02.324 --> 46:04.022
Why do you have to wear a mask?

46:08.766 --> 46:10.265
You don't know
if he's a good person

46:10.289 --> 46:11.769
or if he has bad intentions.

46:12.073 --> 46:14.162
You don't know if he's
trying to do this for fun

46:14.423 --> 46:15.773
or trying kill you.

46:15.947 --> 46:17.296
Who are you under that mask?

46:17.513 --> 46:19.428
Who are you under that mask?

46:19.602 --> 46:21.474
Can you let me see
under that mask?

46:21.779 --> 46:24.782
Can I get who... who are you?

46:25.608 --> 46:27.128
When he's a clown, he could live

46:27.436 --> 46:30.222
in the middle of a shack.
Whenever he's a regular person,

46:30.396 --> 46:31.876
he could be living
in a big, old house

46:31.963 --> 46:33.399
in the middle of town
in Florida.

46:33.921 --> 46:35.769
My friends have said
that he's been working like this

46:35.793 --> 46:38.056
- for over, like, 65 years.
- It's also funny to imagine

46:38.230 --> 46:40.188
that he refuses to drive
or take cars.

46:40.362 --> 46:42.321
He just walks around everywhere.

46:45.454 --> 46:47.413
You can call him.
He will scare people for you,

46:47.587 --> 46:50.111
and he's pretty scary himself.

46:50.285 --> 46:52.200
And it's sort of like
a Bogeyman-man type, uh,

46:52.374 --> 46:55.508
type situation,
except actually existent.

46:55.682 --> 47:00.339
He probably, on Halloween,
he's like very scary,

47:00.513 --> 47:03.298
but on New Year's,
he's, like, very happy

47:04.343 --> 47:06.301
because it's a new year
to scare kids.

47:07.346 --> 47:09.426
There's two people in his body.
Multiple personality.

47:09.478 --> 47:11.132
It's like bipolar disorder
or something.

47:13.178 --> 47:15.223
You could be sitting
beside a murderer

47:15.397 --> 47:16.397
and not even knowing it.

48:29.341 --> 48:31.734
- Jamie!
- Jamie!

48:31.909 --> 48:34.259
- Jamie!
- Jamie!

48:46.924 --> 48:49.143
- Jamie!
- Jamie!

48:50.318 --> 48:51.598
- Jamie!
- Jamie!

48:51.754 --> 48:54.627
Jamie!

49:11.774 --> 49:13.124
- Yeah?
- All right.

49:13.341 --> 49:14.981
How am I gonna know
when I'm not in frame,

49:15.126 --> 49:17.191
or are you guys gonna be able
to cut that or if you...

49:17.215 --> 49:18.801
That's all... yeah,
it's all mic check...

49:18.825 --> 49:20.455
- Don't worry about it all.
- Okay. All right.

49:20.479 --> 49:22.399
- Mic will move around it.
- Roger.

49:30.358 --> 49:31.878
- We good?
- Yes. Action.

49:45.852 --> 49:47.158
I'm Wrinkles the Clown.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.857
I'm not a 65 year old man.

49:51.118 --> 49:52.163
- Ready.
- Action.

49:55.383 --> 49:57.143
You know,
the actor that was chosen

49:57.298 --> 50:00.214
to represent the myth
of Wrinkles under the mask,

50:00.388 --> 50:02.390
I think he was a perfect match.

50:02.564 --> 50:05.306
I think he embodies what
Wrinkles would look like.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.178
He has wrinkles
on all the right spots.

50:07.352 --> 50:09.658
He has the gray hair.
You know, is this guy nice?

50:09.832 --> 50:10.964
Is this guy gonna murder me?

50:11.834 --> 50:13.160
And that's kind of
how Wrinkles is,

50:13.184 --> 50:14.185
you don't know.

50:15.447 --> 50:17.642
There's a number of reasons
why I think it's a good idea

50:17.666 --> 50:20.191
for me to keep
my identity hidden.

50:20.495 --> 50:22.628
I don't wanna make this project
about me.

50:22.889 --> 50:25.457
If people knew who was
under the mask,

50:25.805 --> 50:27.763
it would kind of
ruin the experience.

50:28.547 --> 50:31.158
Besides the fact of just trying
to preserve the mystery

50:31.332 --> 50:32.768
of the Wrinkles character.

50:32.942 --> 50:35.293
Wrinkles gets multiple
death threats a day,

50:35.902 --> 50:38.383
and that's fine for Wrinkles,
that's fine for the project.

50:38.818 --> 50:41.473
But I just don't need that
in my personal life.

50:42.648 --> 50:44.954
At the end of the day,
Wrinkles is just a guy in a mask

50:45.129 --> 50:48.784
and a suit, and these kids
and these people have taken

50:48.958 --> 50:50.960
the Wrinkles character
and molded it into

50:51.135 --> 50:53.572
what they want it to be.
Some of them think he's funny.

50:53.746 --> 50:56.749
Some of them think he's rude.
Some of them think he's scary.

50:57.097 --> 50:58.925
Some of them think he's fake.

50:59.360 --> 51:03.016
Some of them think he's a ghost
or some kind of paranormal,

51:03.190 --> 51:05.888
like, apparition,
and really left it open

51:06.063 --> 51:08.630
to let people decide
on their own

51:08.804 --> 51:10.241
what they think about Wrinkles.

51:14.767 --> 51:16.687
I, never in a million years,
thought that anybody

51:16.856 --> 51:18.901
would think that Wrinkles
is a real person.

51:19.337 --> 51:21.948
Let alone that he scares
children for money.

51:23.906 --> 51:24.994
You know, I made it up.

51:27.171 --> 51:30.478
But I think parents that use
the Wrinkles' voicemail

51:30.652 --> 51:33.090
as an actual disciplinary tactic

51:33.264 --> 51:35.135
to keep their children in line

51:35.353 --> 51:38.965
is kind of messed up.
I mean, it's not something

51:39.139 --> 51:40.662
that I would do as a parent.

51:40.923 --> 51:43.187
Um, I think it's kind
of psychologically damaging.

51:44.405 --> 51:47.539
Hey, I have
these two to three kids

51:47.713 --> 51:51.543
- that don't know how to listen.
- No.

51:51.891 --> 51:54.371
We'd give you the price
of 30 bucks to come scare them.

51:54.459 --> 51:55.634
No.

51:55.982 --> 51:57.679
You know, it's not too far off

51:57.940 --> 51:59.551
from what is kind of

51:59.725 --> 52:02.510
already socially acceptable
with telling their kids

52:02.815 --> 52:04.338
that if you're
not a good person,

52:04.512 --> 52:07.036
or if you lie, if you cheat,
you steal, you know,

52:07.254 --> 52:08.951
you're going to burn in hell
for eternity.

52:09.909 --> 52:12.303
You know, I think
it's more cruel and unusual

52:12.477 --> 52:14.957
than anything that Wrinkles
has ever done

52:15.132 --> 52:16.481
or has ever claimed to do.

52:23.314 --> 52:25.379
I was always just
very curious as a child,

52:25.403 --> 52:28.232
and just very imaginative.

52:30.973 --> 52:33.628
Okay. And you put this
Wrinkles mask on.

52:37.328 --> 52:38.503
Not on me.

52:39.460 --> 52:40.740
The clown under the bed

52:41.027 --> 52:42.594
is just such a go-to

52:42.768 --> 52:46.424
for anyone to think of
because of how iconic it is

52:46.598 --> 52:49.601
going back to the Poltergeist
clown under the bed kinda thing.

52:49.775 --> 52:51.690
I remember, as a kid,
getting a head start

52:51.864 --> 52:53.584
and running into my bed
because I was afraid

52:53.692 --> 52:55.412
something was gonna come out
from underneath

52:55.476 --> 52:56.956
and grab my ankles
and pull me under,

52:57.130 --> 52:58.370
and that will be the end of me.

52:58.914 --> 53:01.265
It is a classic kind of fear.

53:02.962 --> 53:04.529
I tried getting
in the trundle bed,

53:04.964 --> 53:07.923
and I was... I was too big.
We couldn't close the drawer,

53:08.794 --> 53:10.834
which we all kind of
got a chuckle out of, you know.

53:10.926 --> 53:13.538
So a friend who's a little
slimmer than I am, said,

53:13.712 --> 53:15.322
"Hey, you know what,
I could fit."

53:15.540 --> 53:17.340
"Oh All right. Well, here.
Put the costume on.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.818
And I'll get behind the camera
and let's make this video."

53:21.459 --> 53:22.740
All right. Is everyone ready?

53:22.764 --> 53:24.375
- Yup.
- All right.

53:56.798 --> 53:57.798
Action.

54:02.456 --> 54:03.457
Action 2.

54:03.936 --> 54:05.242
This video has

54:05.416 --> 54:06.696
a couple elements
to make it look

54:06.852 --> 54:08.941
more like a security camera.

54:09.376 --> 54:11.857
With these effects,
you can obscure things more.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.512
And I felt like that really
helped make the video

54:14.686 --> 54:15.686
more believable.

54:19.865 --> 54:20.985
Stop for a second.

54:22.694 --> 54:23.738
Okay. Doing good.

54:29.962 --> 54:31.156
This time you're not gonna,
like, do...

54:31.180 --> 54:32.356
Just gonna kinda look at her.

54:32.530 --> 54:33.970
You're not gonna
do anything, though.

54:34.009 --> 54:35.529
You don't wanna do anything
too creepy.

54:35.576 --> 54:37.216
Maybe put a doll next to her
or something.

54:40.538 --> 54:42.540
Mm-hmm. Get out.
Start looking around.

54:48.154 --> 54:49.242
All right, stop.

54:49.895 --> 54:52.898
What if we just had him
grab the camera, disable it,

54:53.290 --> 54:55.204
and then you get to use
your imagination

54:55.379 --> 54:58.164
of what happened after that.
It leaves it open.

54:58.643 --> 55:02.429
And so it makes it
create a story.

55:02.821 --> 55:04.823
A story that you're going
to continue.

55:11.220 --> 55:12.740
We always make a lot of jokes

55:12.874 --> 55:14.746
about living here
in Naples, Florida.

55:15.007 --> 55:16.661
You know, people just come here to die,

55:16.835 --> 55:18.532
and if you're 70 and up,

55:18.706 --> 55:19.968
and you wanna play golf,

55:20.142 --> 55:21.840
and you wanna be in competitions

55:22.362 --> 55:24.408
with your neighbor
on whose house looks nicer

55:24.582 --> 55:26.975
and who drives a better car,
then, yeah, Naples, Florida

55:27.149 --> 55:29.543
is a great place to live.
So I kind of love

55:29.717 --> 55:30.936
that Wrinkles...

55:31.893 --> 55:33.199
looked older,

55:33.373 --> 55:34.853
and he kind of looked
a little creepy.

55:35.027 --> 55:38.073
And he kind of reminded me
of my grandfather

55:38.247 --> 55:42.730
who was retired,
always grumpy, but hilarious

55:42.904 --> 55:44.993
and always had the best jokes.

55:47.605 --> 55:48.799
For the most part,
I've always been

55:48.823 --> 55:50.608
kind of quiet and kind of shy.

55:50.782 --> 55:53.480
And I've never been
in performing arts,

55:53.654 --> 55:55.874
and to all of a sudden
turn on a switch

55:56.048 --> 55:59.965
and just be a personality
that wasn't myself

56:00.487 --> 56:03.098
that was kind of funny
but kind of rude

56:03.447 --> 56:06.101
and just kind of annoyed
by children.

56:06.624 --> 56:09.757
I felt like it was one of
the biggest rushes of my life.

56:12.978 --> 56:14.338
Yeah. Wrinkles the Clown.

56:15.633 --> 56:16.721
Hello.

56:16.938 --> 56:18.218
Yeah. What do you want?

56:20.246 --> 56:21.745
We're gonna get a lot of that.

56:21.769 --> 56:23.329
They can't believe
that someone answered

56:23.423 --> 56:24.598
and just kinda hang up.

56:32.214 --> 56:33.409
Yeah, Wrinkles the Clown.

56:33.433 --> 56:35.522
Hi, Wrinkles.

56:35.696 --> 56:37.176
Hey, how is it going, guys?

56:37.394 --> 56:40.353
I love your voicemail.
It's so cool.

56:40.527 --> 56:42.573
Oh, yeah. That's nice.
Thank you.

56:42.964 --> 56:45.097
Dude, that voicemail
sounds just like that.

56:45.445 --> 56:46.685
Well, that's my voice

56:46.838 --> 56:48.118
so that would make sense, right?

56:49.144 --> 56:50.544
- Wrinkles.
- Yeah.

56:50.972 --> 56:52.539
Do you have a YouTube channel?

56:52.713 --> 56:54.280
No. I don't use the internet.

56:54.541 --> 56:56.195
- Why?
- I don't know.

56:56.369 --> 56:58.249
'Cause I don't like
the internet. It's too hard.

56:58.284 --> 56:59.807
Are you a killer clown?

56:59.981 --> 57:01.381
No. I never killed nobody.

57:02.027 --> 57:05.117
You're... Everybody confirmed

57:05.291 --> 57:07.162
that you're bad
but I don't believe them.

57:08.207 --> 57:10.296
No... yeah. You know,
a lot of people think

57:10.470 --> 57:14.648
- a lot of different things.
- You're so nice.

57:15.867 --> 57:17.347
You caught me on a good day.

57:18.391 --> 57:19.890
- Okay, Wrinkles.
- All right.

57:19.914 --> 57:21.307
- You kids be good.
- Bye.

57:21.786 --> 57:23.309
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you.

57:23.483 --> 57:24.745
Nice meeting you too.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.272
I feel like five years ago,

57:30.447 --> 57:33.754
I was so much more naive
than I am now

57:33.928 --> 57:36.061
because I was actually
really able to prove

57:36.278 --> 57:38.063
a lot of things to myself.

57:38.890 --> 57:43.242
You know, I put a picture,
a name, and a phone number

57:43.416 --> 57:46.158
on a sticker, and...

57:46.767 --> 57:48.595
people just did whatever
they wanted with it.

57:48.769 --> 57:50.268
People of course
are taking pictures of it,

57:50.292 --> 57:51.946
putting it online.

57:52.425 --> 57:53.905
After seeing that,

57:54.079 --> 57:56.342
hey, you know what,
I'm gonna start bolstering

57:56.516 --> 57:58.170
this online presence as well.

57:58.344 --> 58:02.217
So I created the HvUseen
Wrinkles website

58:02.391 --> 58:04.219
and YouTube channel.

58:04.393 --> 58:05.743
And that's when I started, like,

58:06.308 --> 58:09.050
putting a lot more pictures
and, you know,

58:09.224 --> 58:11.096
quote, unquote
"Wrinkles sightings".

58:11.400 --> 58:13.751
I'm trying to think if the video
or the sticker came first.

58:13.968 --> 58:15.404
I think the video came first.

58:20.409 --> 58:24.501
So after that, it became kind
of fun to make Wrinkles videos.

58:24.936 --> 58:27.939
The second one was Wrinkles
walking through a parking lot

58:28.113 --> 58:31.595
with a shopping cart full of
junk as if he was homeless.

58:32.900 --> 58:35.642
And the next video is on US 41.
I think we actually

58:35.816 --> 58:37.992
shot that video
on the same night.

58:41.822 --> 58:42.867
Hey. Huh?

58:50.352 --> 58:52.180
NBC2 local news

58:52.354 --> 58:53.921
was really what kick-started
everything.

58:54.226 --> 58:57.272
It is a thing of nightmares.
Have you seen this clown?

58:57.446 --> 58:59.797
Meet Southwest Florida's
Wrinkles the Clown.

58:59.971 --> 59:01.931
People pay me to go
scare their friends.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.845
People pay me to go dance
at their parties.

59:05.672 --> 59:08.414
You know, that kind of things.
Bar Mitzvahs and whatnots.

59:08.806 --> 59:11.504
All that content
was already in place.

59:11.678 --> 59:13.985
So it was just so easy
for them to put 'em together

59:14.159 --> 59:17.423
and make this, like,
fantastic story.

59:17.597 --> 59:19.773
An internet hit.
A Google Plus account

59:19.947 --> 59:21.601
is dedicated to his sightings.

59:21.906 --> 59:23.536
That created
an opportunity for people

59:23.560 --> 59:25.910
to say, "Why is this man
dressing up as a clown?"

59:26.780 --> 59:28.695
What is he doing?
Why does he keep doing it?"

59:30.436 --> 59:31.436
Oh, my God.

59:32.264 --> 59:33.918
Once it hit The Washington Post,

59:34.135 --> 59:35.722
then it just kind of
snowballed after that.

59:35.746 --> 59:37.095
It's actually
the first clown ever

59:37.574 --> 59:39.377
that can't get other clowns
to squeeze into a car with him.

59:39.401 --> 59:41.075
They're like, "No. You know,
you're a little bit too creepy."

59:41.099 --> 59:42.230
We're gonna walk."

59:42.927 --> 59:44.731
The man inside the mask
is a 65-year-old

59:44.755 --> 59:47.932
Rhode Island transplant who got
sick of making balloon animals

59:48.236 --> 59:51.718
and has moved more towards a
menacing "See this balloon",

59:51.936 --> 59:53.241
kid? It's your head"

59:53.415 --> 59:54.808
before popping it
kind of a clown.

59:55.069 --> 59:56.593
Like happy birthday, Suzie.

59:56.767 --> 59:59.160
Well, we got you a gift
that will haunt you forever.

59:59.726 --> 01:00:02.120
Watching Jimmy Fallon
make fun of Wrinkles,

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.383
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
I can't believe that this"

01:00:04.862 --> 01:00:06.777
actually went as far as it did.

01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:12.478
I think a lot of people
started recognizing

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.212
that whoever this
Wrinkles the Clown is,

01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:16.476
he's getting a lot of attention,
and I'd like to get

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.788
some of that attention too

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:19.354
and I'm gonna dress up
like a clown

01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:21.139
and go in the woods
and scare my friends.

01:00:21.487 --> 01:00:23.847
Disturbing report out
of Greenville, South Carolina

01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:25.970
in a neighborhood there.
People living there say

01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:29.364
a clown is trying to lure
children into the woods.

01:00:29.538 --> 01:00:31.540
Right there at that tree
back there.

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:33.499
They say he uses money and candy

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:34.979
to get children's attention.

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.808
I thought my child was,
you know, seeing things.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.811
The next day I had
about 30 kids come up to me

01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:42.825
and say, "Did you see the clowns
in the woods?"

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.020
I'm over here to make sure
we get a full understanding

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.600
of what is law enforcement doing
because we have around

01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:49.428
two to three hundred children
out here.

01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:53.650
We were working some overtime
squads to patrol in areas

01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:56.217
where we thought
that we would see

01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:57.958
a potential clown sighting.

01:00:58.393 --> 01:01:00.744
What was different
about this situation

01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:05.531
was the viral nature
of the social media.

01:01:08.142 --> 01:01:10.077
- Clowns in the...
- Clown sightings...

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.221
Clowns terrorizing
a town in South Carolina.

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:14.627
Greenville County 911.

01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:16.365
What is the location
of your emergency?

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.713
I am reporting the,
um... the silver clown.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.328
You're reporting what?

01:01:20.502 --> 01:01:22.089
The news about
the clown that's, like,

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:23.680
reportedly going around
our neighborhood

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:25.962
and kidnapping children,
raping 'em, and killing 'em.

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:27.442
Are you just calling
to tell me this is in the news

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:28.586
or do you see him out there?

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:29.965
I've seen him out here.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:32.950
I felt the fear
would overtake us.

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.215
I'm begging you.

01:01:37.824 --> 01:01:40.914
Whoever you are, clowns,
get away.

01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:42.437
The latest clown sighting

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:43.743
happened Tuesday night at.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:45.527
Shemwood Crossing Apartments.

01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:47.952
All we see is these men
jumping over the fence,

01:01:48.139 --> 01:01:50.539
you know, looking at the kids,
and then they take off running

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:53.405
so we all run back here
and chasing them and stuff.

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.755
We've seen 'em busting
through a wood right here,

01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:57.693
pulling the wood,
and then they ran through.

01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.170
I could see if my kid get
snatched up by one of them.

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:02.034
You know what I mean,
but he's just...

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:05.809
It's crazy, all right.
It's real.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.509
It was kind of scary
to see where it was going

01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:12.990
because I didn't know
if like, "Oh, shit."

01:02:13.164 --> 01:02:14.774
Did we have anything to do
with this?"

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:17.864
Before you know it, you have
this creepy clown phenomenon.

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:20.171
Since then,
sightings keep increasing.

01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:22.260
Those creepy clowns
are making headlines

01:02:22.434 --> 01:02:23.609
from coast to coast.

01:02:24.305 --> 01:02:26.196
Flomaton, Montgomery,
Moundville, Brighton, Irondale,

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.180
Rainbow City, Anniston.
It's happening everywhere.

01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:29.963
It started in South Carolina.

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:31.462
- Now it's up here.
- I'm just freaking out

01:02:31.486 --> 01:02:33.140
'cause I'm going
all over Instagram

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:35.926
and all I see is, "Oh, clowns,
clowns, clowns," you know?

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.425
Nobody knows how
to defend against it

01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:38.889
because we don't know
if it's a prank

01:02:38.972 --> 01:02:40.602
or if they're really trying
to harm people.

01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:42.169
Now, kids
are carrying around machetes

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:43.977
with clown masks on
and things like that.

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:45.751
Police Chief Kenny Hampton said

01:02:45.892 --> 01:02:47.764
he saw a clown
carrying a machete.

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.722
He's subject to get shot.

01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:51.352
A clown attacked you
here tonight

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:52.377
and cut you with a knife?

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:54.161
- Yeah.
- How scared were you?

01:02:54.683 --> 01:02:57.164
I was, like, a lot scared.

01:02:57.382 --> 01:02:59.036
He used his selfie stick

01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:01.464
to hit the clown who then
disappeared into the woods.

01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:03.451
Sir, I was not scaring.
I promise you.

01:03:03.475 --> 01:03:05.042
I was not scaring nobody.

01:03:05.216 --> 01:03:08.393
I'm a kid, and I'm afraid
that... that the clowns

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.134
are gonna kidnap me.

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:12.701
You can't be too cautious
when it comes to kids.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.487
You can definitely...
Especially with shootings,

01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:17.101
you know, and this weird
clown thing.

01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:19.883
God forbid a kid ever
shows up with a bomb

01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:22.320
or with a machete
in a clown suit

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:24.148
and starts hacking people up
at a school

01:03:24.322 --> 01:03:27.064
or anything like that.
And, especially, if they ever

01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:28.500
blamed it on Wrinkles,

01:03:28.674 --> 01:03:30.154
that would make me
feel terrible.

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:32.088
- I am a nervous wreck.
- The fact that

01:03:32.112 --> 01:03:33.873
there was a threat
of a shooting at the school,

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.526
and not just one of the schools,
it was all three of them.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.093
The most serious
incident so far though,

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:38.477
has been the death
of a 16-year-old

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.033
in Reading, Pennsylvania.

01:03:40.207 --> 01:03:44.733
It's extremely alarming
about what's going on

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:47.606
right now in the United States.

01:03:50.739 --> 01:03:52.350
What the fuck is happening?

01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:54.545
- I don't know.
- After rumors spread

01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:56.223
on the Penn State Campus,
Tuesday morning,

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:57.921
that clowns were spotted nearby,

01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.487
over 500 students

01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:01.141
took to the streets
to find them.

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:03.883
Fuck that clown!
Fuck that clown!

01:04:04.057 --> 01:04:06.146
Fuck that clown!
Fuck that clown!

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:08.235
Fuck that clown!

01:04:09.106 --> 01:04:10.716
I definitely took a step back,

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.720
but once I saw the power
of throwing an idea out

01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:17.723
and having people
grab onto that idea

01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:20.813
and react to it, I figured,
"Here's an opportunity"

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:23.903
"to really learn some things."

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:28.188
You know, I would
put my phone down

01:04:28.212 --> 01:04:29.822
and walk away for an hour
and come back,

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:32.076
and there would be, like,
thousands of notifications,

01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:33.976
and my phone was dying
'cause it just couldn't keep up

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.438
with all of the text messages
and voicemails.

01:04:38.787 --> 01:04:40.398
They were calling
with their concerns.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.052
They were calling
with their hatred.

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:44.532
They were calling
with their absolute acceptance.

01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:48.014
What does this tell us
about different people

01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:49.426
and how they
process information,

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:50.712
how they view it on the media,

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:52.323
how they view it
on social media,

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:54.910
or just the ideas that
they made up in their head

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:57.284
just seeing a sticker
in a light pole, you know.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.243
What did their imagination
dream up?

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:06.511
This one is one
of my top favorites.

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:11.472
It says "Would you rather
die or die."

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.735
And I thought that would just be

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.912
kind of funny and creepy
at the same time.

01:05:21.265 --> 01:05:22.875
So the top of his head.

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:36.280
Just... Kinda like this.

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:40.588
You're trying to make it
not look perfect.

01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:46.072
The end goal is to make yourself
look like a clown.

01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.771
I put on clown makeup
to scare people.

01:05:51.382 --> 01:05:53.253
Then you're just gonna
put in on your nose.

01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:18.931
I need red lipstick.
I'll be right back.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.736
Once I found out
about Wrinkles, you know,

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.502
I started having other ideas
for clown videos.

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.592
So we got makeup and then
we just basically

01:06:27.766 --> 01:06:29.206
wanted close stuff
and, like, running

01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:30.464
and, like, trying to scare.

01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:32.945
I feel like my videos

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:34.903
are a reflection
of my personality.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.602
Like, I don't try to act goofy.
I just like to make videos

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:40.039
that, like, make me happy,
make me laugh.

01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:49.701
Found some.

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:55.031
- The crazy lady is back.
- The way it started out,

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:56.751
she would just try
to put on makeup

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:59.232
'cause everybody else
was putting on makeup.

01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:01.233
But, uh...

01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:04.194
she would make herself
look like a clown.

01:07:04.368 --> 01:07:07.066
I'm like, "You are not going
to town with me"

01:07:07.284 --> 01:07:09.242
"looking like a clown."

01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:11.001
You're just gonna take it a lot.

01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:15.703
When I upload all my new videos,

01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:17.294
I'm excited. You know, I'm happy

01:07:17.468 --> 01:07:18.947
that, like,
I've got a video done,

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.732
and that I've edited it.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:23.343
I feel like somewhat like
I've accomplished something.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.433
I do have a goal to become
a filmmaker one day.

01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:28.148
What's your favorite food?

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:30.350
Uh, cats.

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:36.400
I always had the mind
of him playing football.

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.315
I had people coming up to me
all the time,

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.659
"He could play for the
Cowboys when he gets older."

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.494
"The doctor says he's gonna be
6'5" when he's older.

01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:44.972
And...

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:46.888
that's just not him.

01:07:47.193 --> 01:07:49.935
This is him. This is what
he likes to do.

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:55.375
You need to make a big dot
on your face.

01:07:56.028 --> 01:07:57.029
Now, I'm Wrinkles.

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:04.573
And now I'll do this too.

01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:13.195
Have you talked
to this neighbor already

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:14.699
- or...
- No. They...

01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:16.546
- I don't really know them.
- Okay.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:18.920
Yeah. I mean, this kind of
is a perfect spot.

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:22.185
There's little bit of cover
and it gives a little, um...

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.772
you know, a little mystery.
And it might make them

01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:26.595
- look a little bit harder.
- Sure. Sure.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.189
So the family would be
playing cards here.

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:35.937
Sitting here, having one
or two kids just right there.

01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:38.046
Maybe you're like...
you're filming

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:39.854
and you kind of zoom in,
you know.

01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:42.398
You just zoom in a little bit,
and you're like, "Oh, my God."

01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:44.685
What the fuck is that,"
you know? Like, "Holy shit."

01:08:45.033 --> 01:08:47.384
The less you say, the better.
Let them be the ones

01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:49.341
that react, but you'll
still be recording,

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.127
but you're gonna be
running as well.

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.694
They'll see floor, ceiling,
floor, ceiling, floor, ceiling.

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.629
- With the camera?
- With the camera.

01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:57.959
And maybe you drop the phone
in the hallway,

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.179
and you, you know, you let...

01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:02.050
Then we're gonna pick up
all the audio

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:04.377
- of the genuine reaction.
- Oh, how great would it be...

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.054
- Screaming.
- If she drops it.

01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:07.792
Yeah. Then I could come in...

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:10.971
Wrinkles could come in,
see the phone,

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:14.019
bend down, pick it up,
end of video.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.243
Do you wanna get some pizza
later on?

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:23.028
That's gonna be the code.

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:24.527
Do you guys wanna go get pizza?

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:25.962
- Yeah.
- You wanna get something?

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:27.424
That's when you know
that he's here.

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:28.947
He just texted here.

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:31.167
When my timer goes off
on my phone,

01:09:31.602 --> 01:09:33.691
then I know I'm gonna start
doing the peek around.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.300
The peek around.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.087
Did anyone see that?
What's outside?

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.786
I swear there's
something outside.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.527
What the fuck?

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.689
I'll come in.
I'll grab the phone.

01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:54.973
I'll hit stop.

01:09:56.409 --> 01:09:58.890
Jesus Christ.

01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:01.458
And then after that happens,

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.358
- I'm booking it.
- Yeah.

01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:04.416
I'm out of here.

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.570
You guys heard those screams,
right?

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.377
- Yes.
- Holy fucking shit.

01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:24.045
One girl came back
to see if, like...

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.103
Everyone else had ran.
I don't know who it was,

01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:27.353
but the one that came back,

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:29.486
I think she saw me,
like, on the porch

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.314
and she fucking lost her mind.

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:34.852
Holy shit. There's fucking cops
all over this neighborhood.

01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:45.757
I think on this one,
I'm gonna cut it off.

01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:49.680
Let's see.

01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:56.659
I kinda love
the abruptness of that.

01:10:57.644 --> 01:10:58.993
You know, with that, it kind of

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:01.102
leaves more to the imagination.
Like, "What the hell?"

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:02.756
What happened after that?
What... You know,

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.869
did Wrinkles get 'em?
Did they get away?

01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:08.264
"Did they call the cops?
Did they..." you know, whatever.

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:15.492
I don't think anything I do

01:11:15.532 --> 01:11:17.969
after the Wrinkles project
is going to have

01:11:18.143 --> 01:11:19.492
as big of an impact.

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:22.495
But sometimes
you surprise yourself.

01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:28.806
Maybe this is just a gateway
into something bigger.

01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:32.241
- Yeah.
- You wanna get something?

01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:36.161
The fuck is that?

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:37.949
I think there is an element

01:11:38.206 --> 01:11:41.427
of internet troll to Wrinkles.
He's provocative, right?

01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:43.342
He's trying to get
a reaction out of you.

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:45.388
Maybe it's screaming
with laughter,

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:46.824
maybe it's terror,

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:49.055
maybe it's calling
his phone number. Who knows?

01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:51.611
By calling him, you're
essentially inviting him in

01:11:51.829 --> 01:11:53.309
into your life.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.620
Testing those boundaries
is a part of growing up.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.444
I'm gonna be calling
a killer clown.

01:11:58.618 --> 01:12:00.490
Apparently, his name
is Wrinkles.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.841
Uh, I got this number
a hundred percent real

01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:05.233
off the Internet.

01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:06.931
I think people just wanna see

01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:09.934
what would happen
if they call the clown.

01:12:10.456 --> 01:12:11.805
Like...

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:13.914
maybe he would come
to their house or something.

01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:16.288
They just wanna see
what could happen.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.595
Oh, dang.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.293
I think the creepiest part
is when he grabs the camera

01:12:21.728 --> 01:12:23.251
and, like, it just goes out.
Like...

01:12:23.774 --> 01:12:26.907
I think if the girl woke up,
it would be complete madness

01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:29.736
and, like, she would start
screaming bloody murder.

01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:33.958
He don't have any eyeballs.

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:37.353
How does he see?

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.445
I do parties,
children behavioral services,

01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:53.217
the whole shebang, you know,
give me a call.

01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:54.881
Are you the real one
that gets hired

01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:56.459
to scare the shit out of kids?

01:12:56.676 --> 01:12:57.958
Yeah. Wrinkles the Clown.

01:12:57.982 --> 01:12:59.331
- You heard of me?
- Yeah.

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:01.486
You know, maybe
the negative parts

01:13:01.594 --> 01:13:04.728
of Wrinkles will die off
and maybe the fun parts

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:07.165
- of Wrinkles will live on.
- Oh, my God.

01:13:07.992 --> 01:13:10.211
- His name is Wrinkles.
- Sweet dreams.

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:12.692
As many people
that hate Wrinkles

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:15.826
and hope he dies a slow,
horrible death,

01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:18.326
there's a lot of people
out there that love Wrinkles

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.743
and they love the character

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.658
and they like the funny parts about him

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:24.115
and they like the cynical
parts that they can relate to.

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:27.228
I love you, Wrinkles, so much.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:30.406
I think you're
the number one clown.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:34.453
We love you. We love you.
We love you. We love you.

01:13:34.627 --> 01:13:36.020
You're my role model.

01:13:36.716 --> 01:13:39.327
I can laugh like you, listen.

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.915
- Wrinkles!
- What're you doing?

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:43.979
- What're you doing?
- High five, again.

01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.658
- High five?
- High five again.

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:46.920
- Please.
- High five. Thank you.

01:13:46.944 --> 01:13:48.264
Oh, my God. You're so cute.

01:13:48.336 --> 01:13:49.642
Oh, God. I can't see.

01:13:49.816 --> 01:13:51.557
There's too many high fives
going on here.

01:13:51.775 --> 01:13:54.081
- One, two, three. Wrinkles.
- Wrinkles.

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:07.051
Our individual minds
are such humongous places.

01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:10.707
And the places that you can go,
it can be some of the darkest,

01:14:10.881 --> 01:14:14.275
deepest depths of just
awful terribleness

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:15.773
to some of the most enlightening

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:17.365
most beautiful places.

01:14:17.888 --> 01:14:21.587
It's just interesting to see
where people decide to go

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.633
in their mind because,
at the end of the day,

01:14:23.807 --> 01:14:25.330
they're the ones

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.134
that are taking
this very small information

01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:28.518
they know about
Wrinkles The Clown,

01:14:28.725 --> 01:14:30.204
and decided which way
to take it.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.666
I saw your YouTube video.

01:14:31.815 --> 01:14:33.335
I don't have a YouTube video.

01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:35.476
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, right.

01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:51.088
- Come on.
- All right.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.725
All right. Last picture
of the night.

01:14:52.749 --> 01:14:54.109
Wrinkles got to go
to the bathroom.

01:14:54.359 --> 01:14:55.403
Come on.

01:18:03.243 --> 01:18:04.243
What?
