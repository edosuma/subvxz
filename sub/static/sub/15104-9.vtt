WEBVTT

00:04.071 --> 00:06.438
(water splashing)
- holy (bleep)!

00:06.440 --> 00:08.741
Narrator: On
"ice road truckers"...

00:08.743 --> 00:10.442
(ice cracking)
- whoa!

00:10.444 --> 00:13.178
Narrator: It's the final runs
of the season.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.580
- How's everybody
doin' back there?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.981
The road's gettin' rough.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.716
Steph: Hammer down,
boys and girls, hammer down!

00:17.718 --> 00:20.185
Narrator: As rivals join
forces...

00:20.187 --> 00:22.087
Lisa: Get 'er done.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.589
Narrator: To make history.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.591
(loud bang)
<u> darrell: Whoa!</u>
- Take it easy.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.992
(engine whirs, huge bang)
- oh my god!

00:26.994 --> 00:29.128
(tires skidding, splashing)
(loud clanking bang)

00:29.130 --> 00:30.529
narrator: And the drivers...

00:30.531 --> 00:32.698
- Holy (bleep)!
- (coughing violently)

00:32.700 --> 00:34.433
mark: Darrell stop
the (bleep) truck!

00:34.435 --> 00:37.369
Narrator: Are fired up.
Lisa: Mark jumped out!

00:37.371 --> 00:39.138
- Fire! Fire!

00:41.575 --> 00:51.617
♪ ♪

00:51.619 --> 00:56.588
♪ ♪

00:56.590 --> 01:09.201
♪ ♪

01:14.508 --> 01:17.242
narrator: There's panic
throughout the north.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.645
The melt's descended
on the winter roads

01:19.647 --> 01:21.713
closing virtually every trail.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.717
As the season rushes
to the final 48 hours,

01:25.719 --> 01:29.521
remote communities are
desperate for supplies,

01:29.523 --> 01:31.990
but as routes turn
to mud and slush

01:31.992 --> 01:35.094
there's no way to get
all the loads delivered.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.165
But the ice road truckers
are refusing to go quietly.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.633
(horn blares)

01:44.738 --> 01:46.505
in northern ontario...

01:47.842 --> 01:49.541
Art: Well, isn't this great?

01:49.543 --> 01:50.943
Narrator: Art burke's fightin'
through

01:50.945 --> 01:53.011
one of the only roads
still open.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.048
And it's a torn up mess.

01:56.050 --> 01:58.283
- This was all melted
to hell, eh.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.918
- I don't know how long this
is gonna be open,

01:59.920 --> 02:02.321
but it's too late now because
I'm already on my way in.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.023
(metal groans)
and you can't turn around.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.126
Narrator: The village
of sachigo lake is counting

02:07.128 --> 02:10.162
on the 20 ton load
of building supplies.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.697
(loud thud)

02:13.067 --> 02:15.467
(tires crunching)

02:15.469 --> 02:16.835
- just tryin' to get as far
as I can before it thaws out.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.670
Narrator: But getting
to the remote community

02:18.672 --> 02:21.573
over the swampy trail
will be a challenge.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.109
(loud splash, thump)

02:24.111 --> 02:26.011
- I just hope to god
this stays frozen

02:26.013 --> 02:28.647
until I get my arse outta here.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.082
(water splashing)

02:30.084 --> 02:32.618
going through a little bit
of rough terrain here.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.520
This is (bleep) ridiculous, eh.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.590
Narrator: There are two paths
to sachigo lake:

02:38.592 --> 02:41.693
A marathon 450 mile route with
scattered small crossings,

02:43.898 --> 02:47.533
or a 100 mile short cut,
but with one giant hurdle,

02:48.936 --> 02:52.404
a notorious four mile stretch
across the ice.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.140
(truck rumbles)

02:55.142 --> 02:57.142
- don't ever buy a truck off
the ice road, b'y.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.977
(chuckling)

02:58.979 --> 03:02.114
it might look good,
but inside it's (bleep).

03:02.116 --> 03:04.683
Narrator: Art's elected
to take the shorter trail,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.219
willing to tangle with
the mammoth crossing

03:07.221 --> 03:08.887
to try and make it in fast.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.156
(loud splash, clattering thuds)

03:11.158 --> 03:13.926
- I've never been
in an earthquake, eh,

03:13.928 --> 03:15.694
but I imagine
it'd be just this:

03:15.696 --> 03:17.729
Me shakin' around like
a (bleep) fool.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.398
(truck rattling)

03:20.734 --> 03:23.502
I forget over the summer
what this is like right.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.204
I should be keepin' notes.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.340
Get it tattooed on my hand
some place: (bleep) no,

03:28.342 --> 03:31.210
and then every time I think
of this I just look at that eh.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.011
(bleep) no, don't go again.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.415
When mark calls,
"ha, ha, (bleep) no!"

03:36.417 --> 03:38.550
(chains rattling)
(loud thump)

03:39.954 --> 03:41.353
(truck rumbles)

03:44.091 --> 03:46.191
narrator: Ten miles back...

03:48.562 --> 03:50.963
Another polar driver's pushing
towards the same destination.

03:50.965 --> 03:53.065
(truck rumbles)

03:53.067 --> 03:56.001
- I'm on my way to sachigo
with a load of lumber.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.937
Narrator: But unlike his
counterpart,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.839
alex debogorski's taking
the long route to get there.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.842
(truck rattles)

04:03.844 --> 04:05.544
alex: I'm probably looking
at about a 15 hour drive

04:05.546 --> 04:10.082
over the ice road which has
been melting for a week.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.818
Narrator: So the legend will
push plenty of extra hours

04:12.820 --> 04:15.387
over bone crushing terrain.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.888
(engine rumbles)

04:16.890 --> 04:18.457
alex: First thoughts
on this road is it's...

04:18.459 --> 04:20.092
(clattering thumps)

04:21.895 --> 04:23.362
it's smoother running over trees

04:23.364 --> 04:25.397
than it is driving
on the road.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.065
(truck rumbles loudly)

04:27.067 --> 04:28.533
the speed I'm going

04:28.535 --> 04:30.269
a sasquatch could just
walk beside the truck

04:30.271 --> 04:32.104
and we could have
a conversation.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.974
"and how are you doing today?"
(sasquatch-like growling)

04:35.976 --> 04:38.510
"well, I'm glad you're happy."

04:40.314 --> 04:41.713
(truck rumbles loudly)

04:41.715 --> 04:44.650
narrator: Willing endure
the rocky additional miles

04:44.652 --> 04:48.020
to avoid the giant crossing
on the other path,

04:48.022 --> 04:51.189
hoping it's the safest bet
to reach the town.

04:51.191 --> 04:55.160
- It's a very unique season.
It's ridiculously short, um,

04:55.162 --> 04:58.430
it started off too warm
and it's ending up too warm.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.599
(truck rattling)

05:00.601 --> 05:04.903
so the challenge today is to
get there and actually, uh,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.005
get some stuff to this
community, as well as, uh,

05:08.409 --> 05:10.642
getting there in one piece.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.644
Narrator: With 200 miles ahead
of him...

05:12.646 --> 05:15.080
(truck rattling)
(loud thumps)

05:15.082 --> 05:16.515
- holy mackerel.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.284
Narrator: Over thawing muskeg

05:19.286 --> 05:22.154
that's been pulverized
all season,

05:22.156 --> 05:24.022
the vet will have
his hands full.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.192
- I'm sure it'll get worse.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.995
(tires squeaking)

05:31.732 --> 05:34.032
narrator: Back in winnipeg
at polar headquarters...

05:35.436 --> 05:37.536
Mark: Hello?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.137
To north caribou?

05:39.139 --> 05:41.306
Well, we heard that road
closed last week.

05:41.308 --> 05:44.276
Narrator: The end of the season
could present a big opportunity

05:44.278 --> 05:46.445
for boss mark kohaykewych.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.814
- If we have your blessing
we will, uh we'll get in there.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.449
And how many loads?

05:51.852 --> 05:55.120
That's a lot of loads
this time of year.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.689
Well, there's no guarantees, but
I'm willing to give it a try.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.057
Let me see whose left here.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.459
I know a lot of guys
have gone home.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.194
Give me 24 hours,
we'll get movin'.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.664
Excellent. Appreciate the call.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.866
Time to roll.
(sighs)

06:07.868 --> 06:09.701
just when I thought
the season was over

06:09.703 --> 06:12.037
there's a community in ontario,
north caribou,

06:12.039 --> 06:13.672
they've contacted us.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.507
There's still some supplies
that need to get in.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.942
The road's have been closed
for a little while,

06:16.944 --> 06:19.978
but they're gonna reopen it
just for us.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.880
This road's gonna have
a lot of challenges.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.315
It's a rough road.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.884
I got one shot to get
this load in.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.653
(phone keys beeps)
I'm short a couple drivers
for this convoy...

06:28.655 --> 06:30.055
(phone ringing)

06:31.425 --> 06:32.791
it can't be just any drivers.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.260
They gotta be top dogs.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.262
Narrator: With everything
on the line for polar

06:37.264 --> 06:39.731
and a community in need,

06:39.733 --> 06:42.033
mark's bringing
in the opposition.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.435
(door shuts)

06:43.437 --> 06:45.404
years ago...

06:45.406 --> 06:47.005
Darrell: I come up here to haul
these loads

06:47.007 --> 06:48.974
and get as many loads as I can.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.143
Narrator: When mark employed
darrell ward,

06:51.145 --> 06:53.078
the two often butted heads.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.613
- You're done.
The door's right there.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.014
- Right on I'm out the door!

06:56.016 --> 06:57.382
- See you later. See ya.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.384
- All right thanks. Yep, bye.
(phone beeps off)

06:59.386 --> 07:02.354
stole another load from polar.
Right on.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.656
Narrator: And after darrell
started his own business...

07:04.658 --> 07:06.057
(truck clanks)

07:06.059 --> 07:07.893
- you get the (bleep) off
my truck, I'm leavin'!

07:07.895 --> 07:10.295
(tires screeches)
thanks for the load, mark!

07:10.297 --> 07:13.031
Narrator: They became fierce
opponents.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.766
- Partners.
- Nice.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.235
Narrator: And the battle only
intensified once darrell

07:17.237 --> 07:19.871
brought aboard lisa kelly.
(hands smack)

07:19.873 --> 07:21.306
mark: Darrell stole lisa
from me,

07:21.308 --> 07:22.741
it's certainly not good
for polar.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.010
I mean it's, it's hurtin' me.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.449
I need some help.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.451
I've got a call from
north caribou,

07:32.453 --> 07:35.253
they've got some loads
they gotta get in there, um...

07:35.255 --> 07:37.189
I know the season's
pretty much done.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.424
It's a late season run,
the road's gonna be crap.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.227
It's been closed for a while

07:42.229 --> 07:43.929
but we got the chiefs blessing
to get on it.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.635
I need experienced drivers
on this. I need both of you.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.072
This is the final run
of the year

07:54.074 --> 07:56.641
and there is no guarantee
we'll get in there.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.015
- What do you think lisa?

08:04.017 --> 08:07.552
- Yeah. I mean, let's get this
stuff into the people
that need it.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.554
- For the community
let's do it.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.591
- You bet.
- Perfect thanks guys.
I appreciate it.

08:12.593 --> 08:16.394
- In situations like this you
have to throw the rivalry aside

08:16.396 --> 08:18.230
to benefit the communities.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.966
If there's ever a year
that they have needed us

08:20.968 --> 08:22.801
this is the year.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.837
Narrator: To pull off
the mission of the season,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.939
darrell and lisa
will be convoying

08:27.941 --> 08:30.509
with polar's top dog, todd dewey

08:30.511 --> 08:33.178
and the company rookie,
steph custance.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.280
Mark: All right, guys,
we got these loads going
to north caribou.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.648
We've got these building
supplies

08:36.650 --> 08:38.183
that they're in desperate
need for

08:38.185 --> 08:39.951
and, uh, they're counting
on us to bring it in.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.353
Todd: Do we even know what
this road's like?

08:41.355 --> 08:42.787
I know the roads are bad but,

08:42.789 --> 08:44.723
I mean, do we know
or are we just goin' in blind?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.691
- Nobody's been down that road
for a good week.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.194
Um, it's enter
at your own risk.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.264
This is the biggest challenge
I've taken on

08:52.266 --> 08:54.499
in all my years
of business here.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.901
Worst case scenario

08:55.903 --> 08:58.303
is we're leaving stuff
in the bush till next year.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.407
I don't know if we're gonna
be able to pull this off,

09:02.409 --> 09:04.342
but I think with, uh,
the right team here

09:04.344 --> 09:06.177
and the companies comin'
together,

09:06.179 --> 09:07.946
I think we can get this done.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.248
So we got housing materials
that's goin', we got one van

09:10.250 --> 09:11.850
and the rest are gonna be decks.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.052
Uh, steph I'm gonna
get you on the van.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.787
No time better than now
to learn.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.524
Mark: Lisa and todd you guys are
gonna be on the decks as well.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.860
I know there's a really bad
hill there so we gotta start

09:21.862 --> 09:23.695
pushin' trucks up
or pullin' trucks up.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.063
We're gonna take the loader.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.665
- Right. That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.099
Mark: So I think I've got
all the bases covered.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.868
Darrell I'll get you to back up
to the loading dock.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.237
We'll uh, I'll get the loader
on there and, uh,

09:32.239 --> 09:34.005
and you and I'll hit the road.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.407
- You and I'll hit the road?

09:35.409 --> 09:38.376
Mark: You bet, bud. I'm hoppin'
in your truck, darrell.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.279
We're gonna have one trailer
just dedicated as a support
vehicle.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.481
I'm gonna bring my loader.
I'm gonna operate it

09:43.483 --> 09:45.650
'cause I know we're gonna need
it in sections of this road.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.887
Uh, let's see if we can
just bury the hatchet

09:48.889 --> 09:51.323
and get this done.

09:51.325 --> 09:53.792
Darrell: Mark and I are pretty
stubborn, both of us.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.694
Bull headed, stubborn,

09:55.696 --> 09:58.363
but we're gonna have to throw
that aside to get this job done

09:58.365 --> 09:59.898
for this community.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.266
Let's get it done.
- Get it done.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.801
- Let's hit the road. Let's go.
- Let's go.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.137
Narrator: The five man convoy
will need to push

10:06.139 --> 10:10.041
over 400 grueling miles
to get to north caribou

10:10.043 --> 10:13.812
on a road that's already been
shut down for the season.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.584
It's a feat neither company
has ever attempted before.
(chains clank)

10:19.586 --> 10:21.319
darrell: You outta be chaining
this (bleep) down.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.854
- Hey, let's not start fighting

10:22.856 --> 10:25.423
before we get out there,
eh buddy?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.058
(loud bang)

10:27.060 --> 10:28.893
- all right.

10:28.895 --> 10:31.429
This season is absolutely crazy.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.531
I mean, if there's any chance
of failing

10:33.533 --> 10:36.401
on any of these loads
this is the one.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.170
Steph: I've got a great
opportunity now

10:39.172 --> 10:40.605
for me to prove myself.

10:40.607 --> 10:41.973
This is like really
my opportunity to show, like,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.408
"hey I'm here,
I, I want to do this.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.276
I'm not gonna stop
at any rate."

10:45.278 --> 10:47.345
let's get goin'! Time to convoy
the (bleep) out of this!

10:47.347 --> 10:49.280
Hammer down, boys!

10:49.282 --> 10:50.715
(engine rattles)

10:50.717 --> 10:52.751
todd: (laughing) I don't know
what's gonna to happen.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.120
When I say epic, I mean epic.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.323
Mark stepped up to the plate.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.025
We're gonna work together
with two companies

11:00.027 --> 11:01.693
to see if we can get
the job done.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.328
- This is gonna get
interesting.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.729
- Yep, let's get out of here

11:04.731 --> 11:06.898
before the weather
gets too warm.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.433
Mark: All right, let's do this.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.901
(door shuts)

11:09.903 --> 11:11.336
- well, what do you guys say,
are you ready

11:11.338 --> 11:13.138
to get this convoy
going or what?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.840
- Let's get on the road, boys.
It's time to hit the road.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.009
- Yep, I'm ready, let's go.
(beeping)

11:19.379 --> 11:22.681
- just got my truck, papa todd.
I'm hopin' we're ready.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.583
- Here we go.
It's a big convoy, baby.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.852
- (bleep) yeah! (bleep) yeah!

11:29.222 --> 11:30.655
(horn blares)

11:35.095 --> 11:37.896
narrator: Deep in northern
ontario...

11:37.898 --> 11:40.298
(trucks rattle and rumble)

11:40.300 --> 11:42.133
lisa: I would say we're on
the winter road

11:42.135 --> 11:44.869
but this sure doesn't look
like a winter road to me.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.573
I don't think I've ever seen
it this thawed out before.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.475
Narrator: The historic
two company convoy

11:50.477 --> 11:54.546
is bearing down on the melted
trail to north caribou.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.980
- This is gettin'
to the point now

11:55.982 --> 11:58.183
where it's not even
a road anymore.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.585
(loud thumps)
- whoa!

12:01.955 --> 12:04.055
(truck rattles and groans)

12:04.057 --> 12:06.458
- holy mackerel.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.760
- First time you've ever been
on one of these roads, huh?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.095
- Ah, they weren't kiddin' when
they said it was closed.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.364
Narrator: The road's so damaged
by the thaw

12:13.366 --> 12:16.034
it's been closed
to all traffic.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.269
- You and I both know how hard

12:18.271 --> 12:20.672
this winter was
on the communities.

12:20.674 --> 12:22.273
- Oh, I know.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.976
Narrator: But with the tiny
village desperate for supplies

12:24.978 --> 12:29.180
it's been open exclusively
for the four truck convoy.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.516
- How's everybody doing back
there? The road's getting rough

12:31.518 --> 12:33.451
and everybody role call in.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.587
- Copy.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.556
Todd: Yeah, we're just tootin'
right along here.

12:38.558 --> 12:42.293
Everybody's keepin'
a nice steady even pace.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.532
- I'm comin' up too.
(truck rattling)

12:48.902 --> 12:50.335
(bleep)!

12:50.337 --> 12:51.836
(truck rumbles)

12:51.838 --> 12:54.706
I'm pumped.
This is my uh, first convoy.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.508
We're going in on
a closed road.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.576
You gotta washed out
mud and tracks.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.112
It's a war zone out here.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.151
(loud thumping)

13:06.152 --> 13:08.253
- the ice roads have melted all
the way down to like bare dirt.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.621
(truck rumbles)

13:09.623 --> 13:11.890
we got ourselves one (bleep)
freakin' rough

13:11.892 --> 13:14.692
nasty lookin' muddy ice road.
(loud boom)

13:16.029 --> 13:18.396
I ain't never seen the roads
like this ever.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.798
- It's gonna be a long ride
in here

13:19.800 --> 13:21.199
on this rough-(bleep) road,
isn't it?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.801
- Yeah.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.937
Narrator: As bad as the
400 mile route is now,

13:25.939 --> 13:29.140
it'll only get worse
as the day wears on.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.542
(chains clanking)

13:30.544 --> 13:32.811
mark: It's a pretty big risk
I'm takin' here.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.379
If these temperatures
get any warmer

13:34.381 --> 13:36.114
we're gonna be in real
rough shape.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.549
- Yeah we are.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.083
(chains clanking)

13:39.085 --> 13:40.518
- wow.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.422
Steph: Hammer down,
boys and girls, hammer down.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.792
- Get 'er done.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.861
(metallic clanking)

13:49.863 --> 13:52.230
- this is gonna be a crazy-
(bleep) trip.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.500
Narrator: As the convoy pushes
forward...

13:57.337 --> 13:59.537
200 miles to the north east...

14:04.177 --> 14:06.077
(truck engine whirs)

14:06.079 --> 14:07.879
(truck rumbles)

14:07.881 --> 14:10.949
...A legend's in the thick
of it too.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.884
Alex: I've been on a lot
of roads than this one,

14:12.886 --> 14:15.553
but it's sittin' right up there
with the worst.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.655
Narrator: On the trail
to sachigo lake

14:17.657 --> 14:21.926
it's been a slow painful ride
for alex debogorski.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.662
- Lower back's pretty stiff
and my upper, you know,

14:24.664 --> 14:28.333
my neck is sore from all
the bouncing back and forth.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.371
My arms are sore from hangin'
on to the steering wheel.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.740
Narrator: To avoid an four mile
ice crossing

14:35.742 --> 14:38.910
alex has taken the long route
to the remote village.

14:40.814 --> 14:43.848
Alex: The challenge of course
is still to get in here

14:43.850 --> 14:48.353
unload my load and get out
before the road uh, gets worse.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.021
Narrator: A road packed
with plenty

14:50.023 --> 14:52.724
of extra muddy and rocky
terrain.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.562
And though he'll avoid
the monster crossing
on the short cut...

14:57.564 --> 15:00.565
- I'm comin' up to
the ice crossing.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.066
Narrator: He'll still have
to tangle

15:02.068 --> 15:04.502
with a mile long stretch of ice.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.972
Alex: I'm a lot nervous
about the ice crossing,

15:07.974 --> 15:11.142
'cause if it's in the same
condition as the road

15:11.144 --> 15:13.077
it's questionable.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.748
This looks like I'm gonna
be sliding on through
the mud here.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.917
Narrator: With conditions
the way they are...

15:18.919 --> 15:21.019
- Holy mackerel! Oh baby.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.658
Narrator: Even a short crossing
could prove deadly.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.394
(engine hums)

15:29.396 --> 15:30.795
- well, we're on the side
of the lake here.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.631
We're on the-we're almost
on the ice.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.901
There's a bunch of ice here
but it's kinda broken.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.708
Doesn't, doesn't look
really too great.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.844
Almost looks like somebody
went through the ice

15:46.846 --> 15:49.681
and then it froze up
on top of 'em.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.115
(ice cracking)

15:53.453 --> 15:56.220
I'm gonna put my coat on,
my hat.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.924
If there's any problems
on the ice crossing

15:59.926 --> 16:01.993
you don't want to jump outta
the truck with no clothes on,

16:01.995 --> 16:05.630
'cause you may end up with
no truck, cold and wet.

16:07.867 --> 16:11.302
It definitely doesn't look
very healthy, uh, but,

16:11.304 --> 16:12.704
but what're ya gonna do?

16:12.706 --> 16:15.006
You can't, you can't jump
across it...

16:16.843 --> 16:19.711
And there's some things
I don't have control over.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.679
I have to hand off to god.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.949
All right.
(airbrakes hiss)

16:24.951 --> 16:26.718
(ice cracking sounds)

16:28.088 --> 16:30.054
okay, here goes.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.522
(engine rumbles)

16:38.098 --> 16:39.530
in the name of the father,

16:39.532 --> 16:42.166
the son and the holy spirit,
amen.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.536
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed it be thy name,

16:45.538 --> 16:47.472
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth

16:47.474 --> 16:49.507
as it is in heaven.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.244
Give us this day our daily...
(ice cracking)

16:53.246 --> 16:57.582
it's definitely doing lots
of crackin' and creakin'

16:57.584 --> 17:00.518
(tires rattle)
snappin' and poppin' and...

17:00.520 --> 17:02.420
(engine rumbles)

17:02.422 --> 17:03.855
(ice cracking)

17:05.225 --> 17:06.691
give us this day
our daily bread,

17:06.693 --> 17:09.193
forgive us our trespasses

17:09.195 --> 17:12.163
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.032
(engine rumbling)

17:14.034 --> 17:16.801
this is kinda ugly lookin'
stuff.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.240
Lead us not into temptation,
deliver us from evil,

17:22.242 --> 17:24.242
for thy is the kingdom,
the power and the glory

17:24.244 --> 17:26.110
now and forever. Amen.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.882
(ice cracking)
these are not nice cracks.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.750
If you have a dry crack
it's not a problem,

17:32.752 --> 17:35.520
they're froze together,
but you have a wet crack

17:35.522 --> 17:37.221
that means the crack
is all the way through

17:37.223 --> 17:39.323
and it's wet and it'll slip.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.192
(loud rumbling)

17:44.497 --> 17:46.697
hail mary full of grace.
The lord is with us--

17:46.699 --> 17:49.067
(loud cracking splash)
oh!

17:49.069 --> 17:51.469
That doesn't sound very good.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.904
(engine rumbles, ice cracking)

17:52.906 --> 17:54.305
(ice creaking)

17:55.942 --> 17:59.444
jesus I trust in you.
Jesus I trust in you.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.845
(loud cracking)

18:00.847 --> 18:03.081
saint michael the archangel
defend us on this day of battle.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.515
(ice cracking)

18:05.852 --> 18:07.318
(loud cracking crash)
whoa!

18:12.292 --> 18:14.859
Narrator: On an ice crossing
on the way to sachigo lake...

18:14.861 --> 18:18.729
Narrator: Alex debogorski's
season could be breaking badly.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.530
(ice cracking)

18:19.532 --> 18:20.998
- jesus I trust in y

18:22.335 --> 18:23.935
(loud cracking crash)
whoa!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.369
(ice cracking)

18:26.706 --> 18:28.473
(engine rumbles, chains clank)

18:29.843 --> 18:32.777
that kinda spooked me.
Crack, bang, pop.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.550
Narrator: The surface
is splintering everywhere.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.985
(ice cracking)

18:42.922 --> 18:46.157
- yeah, I can really hear it
creaking and cracking
over there.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.459
Narrator: And as the ice
evaporates, what's left

18:48.461 --> 18:50.261
can barely withstand
the pressure

18:50.263 --> 18:52.296
from alex's 10 ton haul.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.700
Alex: Angel of god,
my guardian dear,

18:55.702 --> 18:58.136
to whom god's love
and trust commits me here.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.771
In the name of the father,
the son, the spirit, amen.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.143
It's holding up the truck.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.911
(ice cracking)

19:06.913 --> 19:08.379
(loud rumbling)

19:11.184 --> 19:12.617
so far.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.419
(ice cracking, chains rattle)

19:16.789 --> 19:18.990
- that could always change
in a big hurry.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.827
Hopefully we're gettin'
close to shore.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.762
(loud cracking pops)

19:24.764 --> 19:26.764
(ice cracking)

19:26.766 --> 19:30.001
oh-oh-oh there's land, land ho!

19:30.003 --> 19:32.436
Narrator: The end of the
crossing's within sight.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.906
- A hundred yards to go
and I'll be on land.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.575
Narrator: But on the edge
it's also where the ice shrinks

19:37.577 --> 19:39.911
to its thinnest level.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.312
- (singing)

19:43.216 --> 19:45.483
(engine whirs, truck rattles)

19:46.853 --> 19:48.319
come on, baby.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.957
Oh, we're on land.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.126
You can tell 'cause
we're bouncin' again.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.661
(truck rumbling)

19:57.997 --> 20:00.565
thank you, lord.
Had a bad one.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.500
Narrator: Alex may be grateful,

20:02.502 --> 20:05.369
but with over 150 grueling
miles to go

20:05.371 --> 20:07.371
he's far from home free.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.142
- Might take forever to get
there because it's so rough.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.311
(truck rattling)

20:13.313 --> 20:14.712
- ay yi yi yi yi.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.783
Narrators: While alex
rumbles on...

20:20.186 --> 20:22.086
200 miles to the south

20:23.456 --> 20:25.856
the unprecedented
two company convoy

20:25.858 --> 20:28.893
is fightin' the thawing road
to north caribou.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.530
- How's everybody doin'
back there?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.198
- I'm rollin'.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.102
- I'm rollin'.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.973
- Yep, ten-four, I'm right here.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.447
Narrator: The 400 mile path
is a mine field of rocks,

20:49.449 --> 20:52.083
divots and mud,

20:52.085 --> 20:56.387
but for the five person team
failure's not an option.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.822
(loud thumping)

20:59.225 --> 21:02.226
- oh, there's a hole there.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.765
(loud thumping)
whoa, whoa.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.270
(metallic groaning, creaking)

21:14.607 --> 21:16.073
watch the rocks.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.279
(metallic groaning, rattling)

21:22.749 --> 21:24.515
slow her down on the rocks
here kids.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.884
We don't want to bust
any tires.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.023
(loud clanking)

21:35.194 --> 21:36.827
(rattling thumps)

21:36.829 --> 21:39.130
- I think the biggest concern
isn't, uh,

21:39.132 --> 21:40.531
falling through holes
at the moment,

21:40.533 --> 21:43.200
it's trying not to pop
our tires on rocks.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.735
(loud rattling)

21:44.737 --> 21:46.871
narrator: For the veterans
managing the terrain

21:46.873 --> 21:49.740
is taking every ounce of skill
they've got.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.843
(trucks rumble)

21:52.845 --> 21:55.046
(rattling thumps)
- (bleep)

21:55.048 --> 21:56.514
narrator: And for the rookie...

21:58.251 --> 21:59.684
- I'm trying to make sure
I'm careful

21:59.686 --> 22:02.153
and watching where I go.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.155
Narrator: Is trying to prove
she can run with the big boys.

22:04.157 --> 22:07.992
- (bleep) hairy, yeah,
and I'm trying to do my best.

22:07.994 --> 22:12.296
I'm just tryin' to be careful,
make sure I watch my mirror.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.566
(rattling thumps)

22:16.903 --> 22:18.369
do the best I can to make sure

22:18.371 --> 22:20.271
my trailer is followin'
properly.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.207
(rattling thumps)

22:23.209 --> 22:24.875
I can blow a tire and then
we're gonna be here

22:24.877 --> 22:26.277
for a hell of a lot longer.

22:26.279 --> 22:27.678
(engine roars)

22:32.285 --> 22:34.618
- oh! Oh my gosh!
(loud thump)

22:34.620 --> 22:37.421
(metallic screeching,
snow splattering)

22:40.960 --> 22:43.160
narrator: On the rocky road
to north caribou...

22:43.162 --> 22:44.695
Todd: Holy smokes!

22:46.065 --> 22:47.498
(engine idling)

22:48.901 --> 22:51.302
- (bleep) ah.
(engine turns off)

22:52.672 --> 22:54.105
(bleep) man.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.409
(engine starts up)

23:00.713 --> 23:02.446
narrator: The harsh trail
proved too much

23:02.448 --> 23:04.482
for rookie steph custance.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.752
And now towards the back
of the convoy...

23:07.754 --> 23:09.153
(tires skid)

23:09.155 --> 23:11.322
she's stuck in the ditch.

23:11.324 --> 23:12.990
- Ah, hey todd?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.761
Todd: What's goin' on there,
steph?

23:16.763 --> 23:18.162
Narrator: Up ahead...

23:22.402 --> 23:23.768
- Ah!

23:23.770 --> 23:25.202
Narrator: Word of steph's
misfortune

23:25.204 --> 23:27.972
is reachin' the front
of the pack.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.474
Todd: Okay. I'm just comin'
around the corner.

23:30.476 --> 23:33.244
Steph's got herself stuck
in a hole.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.645
- Well, that's all on todd.

23:34.647 --> 23:38.349
I guess that's why he's
at the tail end of this.

23:38.351 --> 23:40.484
- We don't have to go
back there.

23:40.486 --> 23:42.386
- He can pick up the pieces
I guess.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.221
I'm too far ahead.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.225
- Todd you got that for steph?
You're lookin' after that?

23:48.227 --> 23:49.994
Todd: I'm gonna see if I can't
get a rope on her here

23:49.996 --> 23:51.829
and give her a little tug back.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.666
- He'll get her out.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.468
- I didn't want to have
to do this run

23:57.470 --> 24:00.204
with the rookie driver there,
but I don't know,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.006
she's gotta learn sometime.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.643
Narrator: With the road
deteriorating by the hour...

24:05.645 --> 24:07.812
- Oh (bleep).

24:07.814 --> 24:10.448
Narrator: Todd'll have
to act fast.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.517
- Just what I didn't want,
stop the convoy.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.053
Narrat: Or steph and the
top dog could find themselves

24:16.055 --> 24:18.189
separated from the convoy.

24:19.559 --> 24:20.958
- Yeah, I was tryin' to watch
these pot holes

24:20.960 --> 24:22.326
and all these (bleep) rocks
here,

24:22.328 --> 24:23.761
I was lookin' in my mirror

24:23.763 --> 24:25.162
and lo and behold
I drive off into it.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.664
Tood: It's all right it happens.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.365
Just be on the radio.
As soon as I tell you

24:28.367 --> 24:30.768
just put it in reverse.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.203
- Okay.
- Just let 'em start turnin'
backwards

24:32.205 --> 24:33.671
and I'll just give her a good
tug. She should come right out.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.506
- Okay.
(chains clank)

24:37.877 --> 24:39.243
- it's always somethin' up
here, man, always somethin'.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.646
(door shuts)

24:44.550 --> 24:46.217
you ready steph?

24:46.219 --> 24:47.618
Steph: Yeah, I'm ready.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.720
- Okay, here we go.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.322
(engine grinds, loud clank)

24:52.892 --> 24:54.325
(tires grinding)

24:57.230 --> 24:58.729
(tires grinding)

25:00.099 --> 25:02.166
(loud clank, engine revving)

25:06.339 --> 25:09.640
(tires crunching,
chains clanking)

25:09.642 --> 25:11.242
(engine revving)

25:11.244 --> 25:13.010
let me know when
you're clear of it.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.949
Steph: I'm good I should be
able to get out from here.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.384
(airbrakes hiss)

25:24.190 --> 25:26.323
- it's all it takes sometimes
is a good little tug

25:26.325 --> 25:28.659
on somethin' to get somebody
out real quick.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.828
Could have been a hell
of a lot worse than that.

25:30.830 --> 25:34.498
Narrator: Todd's got the
22-year-old outta the ditch.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.333
- Thanks papa todd!
- (chuckles)

25:36.335 --> 25:37.868
todd: Oh, no problem.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.436
Narrator: And the back half
of the convoy

25:39.438 --> 25:40.971
hustles back onto the road.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.274
- Let's get goin'.
(door shuts)

25:43.276 --> 25:44.708
(horn honks)

25:44.710 --> 25:47.111
woo!

25:47.113 --> 25:50.481
Narrator: But with 200 miles
of disastrous road conditions
to go...

25:50.483 --> 25:51.916
Mark: Everybody moving?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.484
- Steph is out and rollin'.

25:53.486 --> 25:56.787
Narrator: The miracle mission
is far from over.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.622
- Hammer down!

26:02.061 --> 26:05.195
Narrator: 150 miles
to the north

26:05.197 --> 26:07.831
on the trail to sachigo lake.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.567
(water splashing loudly)

26:11.938 --> 26:13.604
- so far this season this
is the worst (bleep) kicking

26:13.606 --> 26:15.539
the truck got yet eh.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.407
Narrator: Art burke's
on his own.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.108
(loud rattling)

26:18.110 --> 26:20.711
- I got to beat the clock
here eh.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.180
That's the clock shinin' there.

26:23.182 --> 26:27.184
If I don't beat that
shiny clock that's up there

26:27.186 --> 26:29.320
I don't get out of here.

26:29.322 --> 26:31.455
Narrator: Even in the best
of circumstances

26:31.457 --> 26:35.125
this road is one of the most
challenging in all of ontario.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.560
(water splashing)

26:36.562 --> 26:40.097
- the road is all full of mud,
big ruts in it eh.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.833
(bleep) time to get in here.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.469
Narrator: But as the warming
weather continues its assault...

26:45.471 --> 26:47.404
(water splashing)

26:47.406 --> 26:50.741
it's an all out battle
just to keep moving.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.043
(loud splashing thump)
(truck rattling)

26:56.148 --> 26:59.817
- I'm honored to bring it
but holy (bleep).

27:05.091 --> 27:06.457
Narrator: To get to sachigo

27:06.459 --> 27:09.793
the wild card chose
to take the shortcut,

27:12.131 --> 27:14.298
the good news, he's finally
entering the home stretch.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.202
- We're gonna go out on a limb
here pretty (bleep) soon,

27:18.204 --> 27:20.671
'cause we're gettin' close
to this lake.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.906
Narrator: The bad news,
he's about to face off

27:22.908 --> 27:26.410
with one of the biggest
crossings in ontario.

27:26.412 --> 27:31.982
♪ ♪

27:31.984 --> 27:33.951
(truck rumbles, hisses)

27:36.689 --> 27:38.589
- this is the ice crossin'
that I (bleep) went through

27:38.591 --> 27:40.124
last year I think.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.228
(engine idles)

27:45.831 --> 27:47.297
(door shuts)

27:48.668 --> 27:51.568
(ice cracking)
this is the one, b'y.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.971
It's crackin' when I'm walkin'
on it for (bleep) sake.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.406
(ice cracking)

27:56.776 --> 27:58.409
narrator: Last season...

27:58.411 --> 28:00.310
Art: No, no, no, no, no!

28:00.312 --> 28:02.079
(ice cracks, thunders)

28:03.416 --> 28:04.982
we broke through
the (bleep) ice, man.

28:04.984 --> 28:08.252
Narrator: Art nearly met his
maker on the same crossing.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.088
Art: I gotta turn this around
and go back.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.556
Narrator: Earlier this winter...

28:12.558 --> 28:15.793
- I gotta be (bleep)
to be doing this eh.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.195
Narrator: He tangled with
the lake once again.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.498
Art: And arty is off the ice!

28:21.500 --> 28:23.901
Narrator: And came out
victorious.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.703
(chains rattling)

28:27.473 --> 28:32.943
but now as warming temperatures
are rapidly melting the ice...

28:32.945 --> 28:35.145
- I'll tell that four or five
warm days

28:35.147 --> 28:37.247
just about (bleep) this, b'y.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.184
Narrator: He's tempting fate
once again.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.618
(ice cracking)

28:44.390 --> 28:45.989
art: Hopefully in the middle
of this

28:45.991 --> 28:48.659
will be better than last year.

28:48.661 --> 28:51.628
Anyway b'y, we're not turnin'
round now.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.030
I'm gonna roll on it.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.833
(ice popping)

28:57.970 --> 28:59.403
(door shuts)

29:00.840 --> 29:02.306
(chains rattling)

29:03.676 --> 29:05.709
all right, away we go again.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.445
(truck rumbling, ice cracking)

29:08.447 --> 29:10.247
(ice popping and cracking)

29:10.249 --> 29:14.084
we're the last truck.
There's nobody else here.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.789
So there's something wrong
with this (bleep) picture.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.624
(ice popping and cracking)

29:22.294 --> 29:27.431
all the snow is all melted off
this and everything look.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.866
(ice cracking)

29:31.203 --> 29:33.504
there's some nice tracks
in this mother (bleep), b'y.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.572
Some of them it's open
that wide.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.775
(ice popping and cracking)

29:40.379 --> 29:42.079
I'm not even a gambler, man.
I don't gamble.

29:42.081 --> 29:45.783
I'm not into that at all,
yet I'll do this.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.719
This is the biggest (bleep)
gamble of all, man.

29:48.721 --> 29:51.922
You lose on this one
you only lose once.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.590
(ice cracking, tires crunching)

29:57.730 --> 29:59.163
(ice cracking)

30:01.433 --> 30:02.866
(loud clank)

30:05.004 --> 30:06.870
(engine rumbling)

30:10.409 --> 30:12.442
something's going on out there.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.877
(ice cracking)

30:15.214 --> 30:16.613
(brakes squeak)

30:16.615 --> 30:18.015
I gotta stop here
on the ice, b'y.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.449
I'm not sure what the (bleep)
goin' on here,

30:19.451 --> 30:21.318
but I think we're afire.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.826
What the (bleep) is goin'
on here?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.529
We're (bleep).

30:38.571 --> 30:41.772
Narrator: On the mammoth
crossing to sachigo lake...

30:41.774 --> 30:46.109
Now there's a hole (bleep)
in the (bleep) radiator.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.511
(hood bangs down)

30:47.513 --> 30:49.046
I don't know what the (bleep)
we're gonna do, buddy.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.781
We gotta get the (bleep)
out of here.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.916
(clanking)

30:52.918 --> 30:54.952
narrator: His radiator's sprung
a severe leak

30:54.954 --> 30:58.856
and his fan's been busted
from the rocky ride.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.557
(engine sputtering)

31:01.894 --> 31:03.660
- now she won't start.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.396
Narrator: And now
his overheated truck

31:06.398 --> 31:09.466
may be down for the count.

31:09.468 --> 31:12.302
- I can't (bleep) believe
it won't (bleep) start, man.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.871
(liquid dripping)
(engine turning)

31:16.075 --> 31:17.574
this is a nightmare.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.577
We're broke down
on the (bleep) ice.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.714
(metallic clanking)

31:25.084 --> 31:26.516
we're (bleep).

31:27.920 --> 31:29.319
(liquid dripping)

31:30.723 --> 31:32.256
(engine turning)

31:32.258 --> 31:34.491
(ice popping and cracking)

31:36.495 --> 31:38.528
I can't believe any of this,
buddy.

31:38.530 --> 31:42.165
(engine turning)
(ice popping and cracking)

31:43.936 --> 31:45.969
(ice popping and cracking)

31:49.475 --> 31:51.475
now, come on.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.912
(engine roars to life)

31:54.914 --> 31:57.547
narrator: Cooled off,
the engine finally starts up.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.383
(ice popping and cracking)

31:59.385 --> 32:02.753
but whether it'll survive the
last two miles of the crossing

32:02.755 --> 32:04.588
is a complete unknown.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.692
Art: Well I'm gonna see
if I can't limp this (bleep)

32:08.694 --> 32:11.128
across this (bleep) lake.

32:13.198 --> 32:15.966
We're losin' fluid like
a mother (bleep) though eh.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.434
(ice popping and cracking)

32:17.436 --> 32:19.970
we can't go far like this.
(truck creaks)

32:19.972 --> 32:21.471
if the engine overheats
it'll (bleep) the engine.

32:21.473 --> 32:22.906
I can't let that happen, right,

32:22.908 --> 32:25.709
I'll have to stop
before that happens.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.278
This makes it even more
(bleep) up.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.881
I'm gonna as far as I can, b'y.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.083
There's no other option, buddy.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.819
I can't go out there (bleep)
around anymore.

32:35.821 --> 32:38.588
I can't shut her off, she
(bleep) near didn't start there.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.225
It had to go and
(bleep) up here,

32:42.227 --> 32:45.429
of all places eh,
on the (bleep) ice eh.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.264
(ice popping and cracking)

32:49.535 --> 32:51.535
I've just got my (bleep)
fingers, legs, nuts

32:51.537 --> 32:52.936
and everything crossed.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.371
(ice cracking)

32:56.475 --> 32:58.542
it is crackin'
like a bastard eh.

32:58.544 --> 32:59.977
(ice cracking)

33:02.014 --> 33:03.547
okay, b'y,
another (bleep) 100 yards

33:03.549 --> 33:05.649
we're off the ice here.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.518
(ice cracking)

33:10.255 --> 33:13.223
(kissing sounds)
come on, you old (bleep).

33:13.225 --> 33:15.092
Hang on.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.626
(ice cracking)

33:18.630 --> 33:21.264
(truck rattles and rumbles
on solid ground)

33:23.202 --> 33:25.602
we're off the (bleep) ice
anyway, b'y.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.938
That's the main thing.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.673
Narrator: Art's off the lake.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.174
(truck rattles and squeaks)

33:31.176 --> 33:33.977
still okay, b'y, if we can make
up still a little bit here now

33:33.979 --> 33:35.946
without her gettin' hot.

33:35.948 --> 33:38.882
Narrator: Now he's gotta get
through the last 50 miles

33:38.884 --> 33:42.119
of thawing winter road
to reach the village.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.520
(truck rattles)

33:46.992 --> 33:50.494
- well, all the snow
is gone off this.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.263
So now we're just drivin'
on the partially frozen muskeg.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.002
I'm just hopin' that another
piece of that's not gonna
blow off

33:59.004 --> 34:01.671
and get through the thing
completely eh.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.140
(loud thumping)

34:05.778 --> 34:07.477
never (bleep) ends eh.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.213
(truck rattling)

34:10.215 --> 34:12.382
this is a (bleep) nightmare,
b'y.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.785
(water splashes, loud thuds)

34:17.723 --> 34:19.189
(loud thumping)

34:21.393 --> 34:23.627
narrator: Finally...
(truck squeaks and rattles)

34:23.629 --> 34:25.095
art: So far so good.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.333
Narrator: Art sputters
into the remote community.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.269
Art: I'm gonna take us right
up here and park it.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.703
(truck hisses)

34:35.107 --> 34:36.973
(airbrakes hiss)

34:36.975 --> 34:39.810
(engine rattles off)
(liquid dripping)

34:39.812 --> 34:41.678
narrator: Despite all
the challenges,

34:41.680 --> 34:43.380
the load of construction
supplies

34:43.382 --> 34:45.482
makes it to sachigo lake.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.419
Art: She's pretty (bleep).

34:49.421 --> 34:52.355
Narrator: But it may have been
at the expense of art's rig.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.757
(liquid pouring)

34:53.759 --> 34:55.158
- see this is loose.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.461
The whole top of that's loose,
look.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.696
Broke all that off,

34:59.698 --> 35:02.265
put a hole at the top
of the radiator there

35:02.267 --> 35:04.367
because a piece
of the fan hit it.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.104
So we're (bleep).

35:08.474 --> 35:11.041
Everything in there is (bleep).

35:11.043 --> 35:13.677
I just limped her across
the line, b'y.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.112
Here I am.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.315
Last load of the season,

35:19.685 --> 35:21.084
all that bang-bang-bang-bang-
bang,

35:21.086 --> 35:22.686
the old truck couldn't take it.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.021
The radiator is hanging off,

35:25.023 --> 35:29.059
the fan is all smashed to hell,
the scrod is broke.

35:29.061 --> 35:31.128
Narrator: The vehicle's beyond
repair

35:31.130 --> 35:33.563
and with no maintenance shop
in the small town...

35:35.100 --> 35:36.533
- It's nothing I can do
about it,

35:36.535 --> 35:38.001
it's out of my hands.
I'm not a mechanic,

35:38.003 --> 35:41.371
and if I was I don't have a
radiator or any of that stuff.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.040
Narrator: Art burke's a man
without a truck

35:44.042 --> 35:46.109
350 miles from winnipeg.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.346
(hood clanks down)

35:49.348 --> 35:51.581
- (chuckling) I don't know
what's gonna happen.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.961
Rivals have come together
on an historic run.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.864
- It's like going into
no man's land.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.900
It's like a road to nowhere.

36:09.902 --> 36:13.737
Narrator: And while the convoy
has already put 200 miles
behind them,

36:13.739 --> 36:16.506
they've still got
200 more to go.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.308
(truck rattling)

36:18.310 --> 36:22.846
dirt-(bleep) roads, the snow
has melted completely away.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.682
- It's all washed out.
(bleep) bumpy.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.952
Keep her comin', boys.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.388
Narrator: The tough road
is putting everyone on edge.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.527
(loud thumping)

36:37.529 --> 36:39.596
mark: Jesus! Why don't you get
up on the higher ground there?

36:39.598 --> 36:40.964
What are you a pothole magnet?

36:40.966 --> 36:43.099
- That looks worse than
this over here.

36:43.101 --> 36:44.868
(loud rattling bangs)

36:46.271 --> 36:47.637
- come on!

36:47.639 --> 36:49.072
- What the (bleep) you talkin'
about?

36:49.074 --> 36:50.440
- You're driving, man, come on!

36:50.442 --> 36:51.841
- Well what the (bleep)
you want me to do?!

36:51.843 --> 36:53.243
- Just take it easy!

36:53.245 --> 36:54.644
Darrell: I am takin' it easy!

36:54.646 --> 36:56.012
I'm takin' it as easy
as I can take it!

36:56.014 --> 36:58.415
I'm doing 15 kilometers an hour!

36:58.417 --> 37:00.150
Mark: (on radio) well, I don't
need your cowboy (bleep)
right now,

37:00.152 --> 37:02.018
just (bleep) slow
the truck down!

37:02.020 --> 37:04.087
Darrell: (on radio) hey, I'm
doing 15 kilometers an hour--

37:04.089 --> 37:05.989
mark: (on radio) what (bleep)...
(yelling over each other)

37:05.991 --> 37:07.624
darrell: (on radio)
yeah, I can see that (bleep)...
- (bleep) you!

37:07.626 --> 37:09.159
You're supposed to be the
(bleep) leader so lead!

37:09.161 --> 37:11.228
Come on! Steer the rig!

37:11.230 --> 37:12.729
- (giggling)

37:12.731 --> 37:15.198
- I don't know if we were
supposed to hear that.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.170
- You quit bitchin' about
my drivin' or what?

37:20.172 --> 37:21.838
- I'm not bitchin' about
your drivin'.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.673
- You got darrell
the know-it-all

37:23.675 --> 37:25.942
and you got mark
the know-it-all and that,

37:25.944 --> 37:27.911
it's like putting a dog
and cat in cab together

37:27.913 --> 37:30.313
and lockin' the door.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.015
- As long as we get there no
they can (bleep) kick, scream

37:32.017 --> 37:33.450
and fight with each other
the whole way,

37:33.452 --> 37:34.517
but if we get there
that's all that matters.

37:36.154 --> 37:37.954
- We need to get in and out
pretty (bleep) damn quick

37:37.956 --> 37:39.322
because spring's comin'.

37:39.324 --> 37:40.757
- We don't need to get
in and out quick

37:40.759 --> 37:42.692
we just need to get
in and out safe.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.427
- What the (bleep)
I get myself into?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.630
- Hey, you signed up for this.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.601
(gearshift grinds)
(engine revving)

37:54.006 --> 37:56.306
(engine rumbles to stop)
(airbrakes his)

37:57.876 --> 37:59.442
- what you gotta take
a leak now?

37:59.444 --> 38:01.144
- No. I'm gonna (bleep)
change the seats.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.446
You're so (bleep) smart.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.516
- Oh, I get the honor of
driving darrell ward's truck?

38:06.518 --> 38:07.984
Me?!

38:09.721 --> 38:11.187
(door shuts)

38:12.557 --> 38:15.792
- all right let's have some
fun with this.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.227
Why don't you go have a nap?

38:17.229 --> 38:19.596
- I think I will.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.364
I think I'll just kick back
right here and... (door shuts)

38:21.366 --> 38:23.099
take a (bleep) nap.
Let's see how you drive.

38:26.171 --> 38:29.372
- Darrell ward,
trucker extraordinaire.

38:29.374 --> 38:30.807
(truck gears grind)

38:30.809 --> 38:32.409
- oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! (bleep) me.

38:32.411 --> 38:35.845
Mark: (laughs)
- really? Seriously?

38:35.847 --> 38:37.914
- (laughing)
- huh?

38:37.916 --> 38:40.016
I hope you don't have to get
out more than one gear.

38:40.018 --> 38:43.320
Mark: No we're just gonna keep
it in second the whole time.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.288
(truck rattling)

38:45.290 --> 38:47.691
- I think you're hitting more
(bleep) bumps than I was.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.793
(truck banging and rattling)

38:49.795 --> 38:51.661
this is way rougher than when
I was driving.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.129
You can't tell me it's not.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.398
- Ah well...
- Huh?
- Road conditions, buddy.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.800
- Yeah, whatever.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.435
(rattling and popping)

38:58.437 --> 39:01.638
it's rough, I'm not gonna lie.
It's rough.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.107
Right what am I supposed to do?
- Come this way farther.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.842
I don't know we got a bunch
of rocks there, bud.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.977
We got a rock right there.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.379
You got another one there,
you got another one there,

39:09.381 --> 39:11.348
you got another one there,
you got another one there.

39:11.350 --> 39:12.949
Where the (bleep) do you go?

39:12.951 --> 39:14.617
- Right between 'em.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.753
(engine hums)

39:18.724 --> 39:21.491
hang to the right.
- I'm gonna do that. Thank you.

39:21.493 --> 39:22.959
(chains rattling)

39:24.296 --> 39:25.695
- don't be hitting that
big (bleep) right there.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.063
Mark: I see it, I see it.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.531
(truck creaking)

39:30.502 --> 39:31.968
(tires crunching)

39:33.372 --> 39:35.238
(loud rattling)

39:35.240 --> 39:36.706
- missed it... There you go.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.842
- Oh-oh-oh look at that!

39:38.844 --> 39:40.777
- You'll make a big rigger
one day, won't ya?

39:40.779 --> 39:42.946
- (laughing)
- (hands slap)

39:42.948 --> 39:44.748
- pull your (bleep) boots
off the desk

39:44.750 --> 39:47.650
and putt 'em on the (bleep)
throttle!

39:48.987 --> 39:50.420
I want my (bleep) truck back.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.788
Mark: Yeah, you can have
it back.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.189
- Yeah, I do, I want it back.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.592
Mark: I've had enough.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.926
(tire crunch, airbrakes hiss)
(engine rumbles to a stop)

39:56.928 --> 39:57.794
I got the, I got the
darrell ward ice road lesson.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.196
Darrell: Yeah, you made it.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.632
As long as you listen to what
I'm tellin' you on the road.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.933
Mark: I'll listen to you, man.
You got a lot of experience

40:03.935 --> 40:04.734
and I'll give you
a lot of credit.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.169
(airbrakes hiss)

40:07.572 --> 40:09.739
- all right,
let's hit the road.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.808
(door shuts)

40:11.810 --> 40:13.877
(trucks rumble, chains rattle)

40:13.879 --> 40:16.246
- at the end of the day we'll
get the job done together.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.047
- I know it.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.482
(chains rattling)

40:20.886 --> 40:22.986
how much money are you makin'
off this deal?

40:22.988 --> 40:24.988
- It's irrelevant. The
community gets the supplies

40:24.990 --> 40:26.656
and we all go home.

40:26.658 --> 40:30.326
- I was just curious what
you were gettin' out of it.

40:30.328 --> 40:31.795
(rapid beeping)

40:33.098 --> 40:34.631
mark: What's going on?

40:34.633 --> 40:36.399
- I don't know my gauges
were just (bleep) up

40:36.401 --> 40:39.969
and all my lights came on,
all my dash lights.

40:39.971 --> 40:43.206
What the (bleep)?
My gauges are done.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.574
- What's goin' on?

40:44.576 --> 40:46.776
- I don't know.
I smell some wiring.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.281
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
- Can you smell it?
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

40:51.283 --> 40:53.450
(loud hissing)
holy (bleep)! Darrell!

40:53.452 --> 40:55.852
