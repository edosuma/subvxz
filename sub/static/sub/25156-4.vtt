00:07.141 --> 00:09.274

   Because the category is...

00:12.246 --> 00:16.882
   -Luscious Femme Queen Body.
    -(cheering and applause)

00:16.984 --> 00:18.250
 ("So Many Men, So Little Time"
    by Miquel Brown playing)

00:18.352 --> 00:20.019
          Lusciousness.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.086
             Titty.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.355
         Titaciousness.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.923
          Come on, now.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.225
           Voluptuous.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.327
    The tittiness of it all.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.930
   ELEKTRA: Oh, the vulgarity
     this scene has become.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.198
      When I was coming up,
          showing skin

00:33.300 --> 00:35.134
  meant a slit above mid-thigh.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.270
     -Why is my glass empty?
         -How do I look?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.072
         Is the category
        Bore Me to Death?

00:40.174 --> 00:42.241
     Aw, sookie sookie, now.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.009
     What's coming on here?

00:44.111 --> 00:46.078
           Yeah, baby.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.247
        Call Minute Maid.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.982
       Call "Tropicanta."

00:50.084 --> 00:54.086
     There is a juicy battle
      on the floor tonight.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.954
      Why you got to always
        run me down girl?

00:56.057 --> 00:57.089
          Some mothers
      raise their children

00:57.191 --> 00:58.924
       with the soft touch
       of a velvet glove.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.959
    I prefer being the mother
    that slaps them with it,

01:01.062 --> 01:03.128
  especially when they're about
   to bring shame to my house

01:03.230 --> 01:06.098
  by walking a category they're
   not physically suited for.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.900
          You just said
  those other girls look cheap.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.101
    Well, what have we here?

01:09.203 --> 01:10.335
            Catwoman.

01:10.438 --> 01:14.106
          Yes, Siamese.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.108
 She's from the Pacific Islands,
            darling.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.943
           I see you.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.912
     I see all of it, baby.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.180
      Give it to me, Mama.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.983
 Body categories are about tits
     and asses out to here.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.019
          You look like
     you could crack walnuts

01:27.121 --> 01:28.287
     with those ass cheeks.

01:28.389 --> 01:31.356
    You're wrong. You'll see.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.366
           PRAY TELL:
       Oh, wait a minute.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.203
    Wait a minute. Excuse me.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.973
     Excuse me. I think you
 may have misheard, Miss Candy.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.942
   This ain't no face category

01:50.044 --> 01:51.210
   that you're used to winning
           every time.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.078
    This is a body category.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.279
          Body, sugar.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.916
 This is a sexy category, sugar,

01:58.018 --> 01:59.952
        and ain't no one
      in this place sexier

02:00.054 --> 02:01.253
   than this bitch right here.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.090
  And where's the lusciousness?
       Where's the juice?

02:05.192 --> 02:08.127
  If I squeezed you, I wouldn't
be able to get enough out of you

02:08.229 --> 02:10.395
to fill a Dixie cup of lemonade.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.267
     Why don't you come off
   that perch and try, bitch.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.207
   How about we let the judges
           settle it.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.276
            Shall we?

02:24.378 --> 02:25.277
     (cheering and applause)

02:25.379 --> 02:27.045
       Judges, your scores

02:27.148 --> 02:30.082
        for Juicy Nipples
     and her juicy nipples?

02:30.184 --> 02:33.051
    Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.888
     And for Princess Monaco

02:35.990 --> 02:38.924
  and that ass that can launch
        a thousand ships?

02:39.059 --> 02:42.928
    Nine, ten, ten, ten, ten.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.330
  And for Miss Siamese Catwoman
   crawling across the floor?

02:45.432 --> 02:48.967
         What do we got?
        Nine, nine, nine,

02:49.069 --> 02:51.003
            ten, ten.

02:51.105 --> 02:53.005
     And now for Miss Candy

02:53.107 --> 02:56.074
  from The House of Abundance.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.111
         Six, six, six,

02:59.213 --> 03:01.013
            six, six.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.247
         (crowd jeering)

03:03.417 --> 03:07.052
  Oh, sweetie, now do you see?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.288
            These are
   the lowest scores possible.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.056
     The mark of the beast.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.225
         I believe these
      are the lowest scores

03:13.327 --> 03:14.960
         that any member
    of The House of Abundance

03:15.062 --> 03:17.896

    at any ball I can recall.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.298
           I would say
     that Mother of the Year

03:19.400 --> 03:22.134
        for Miss Elektra
      is clearly threatened

03:22.236 --> 03:23.335
      by such poor showing.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.138
   Grand prize: Juicy Nipples.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.042
        First runner-up:
      Miss Princess Monaco.

               No.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.932
   I don't need your sympathy.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.034
  Why you got to be like this?

03:56.136 --> 03:57.936
       I'm coming out here
     trying to be friendly,

03:58.038 --> 04:01.206
    and you acting like I got
  some type of ulterior motive.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.143
         Just because we
       in different houses

04:05.246 --> 04:06.979

  I don't got feelings for you

04:07.081 --> 04:08.914
 when you get clocked like that.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.049
       We all been there.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.052
       Not you. You pass.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.988
   The most out of every bitch
         in that place.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.194
      Can I use your light?

04:34.241 --> 04:37.209
Everyone thinks it's all so easy

04:37.311 --> 04:39.311

04:39.413 --> 04:41.380
            It's not.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.351
  You know what happened to me
           last night?

04:48.255 --> 04:51.123
        My man was over.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.025
         Pillow talking.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.893
            You know.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.063
    How do you get your skin

        It's my hormones.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.138
   It ain't all good, though.

        does not make you

08:01.281 --> 08:04.049
    a dancer worthy of a spot
        in the showcase.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.917

             Better.

08:16.196 --> 08:20.032
   I don't think you're ready,
  but I'll allow your audience

08:34.381 --> 08:36.914

08:37.017 --> 08:39.017

08:39.119 --> 08:40.852
 I got a couple questions first.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.854
     What exactly do you do?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.289
Well, I help girls like yourself

08:44.391 --> 08:47.025
    who don't have the means
    to get work done uptown,

08:47.127 --> 08:49.227
  but still want great results.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.099
     Girl, she fills you up
         with silicone.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.867
       Same stuff they put
        in fake titties.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.969
     Except they putting it
        in my ass cheeks.

08:58.072 --> 08:59.871
Won't that just leave you lumpy?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.974

09:03.077 --> 09:04.776

       What I do is legit.

09:09.183 --> 09:10.816
            I worked
   with a white doctor uptown

09:10.918 --> 09:12.050
       who used to do this
          for the girls

09:12.152 --> 09:13.819
  who could actually afford it.

09:13.921 --> 09:17.122
       Everything I know,
  I learned from watching him.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.092
         Walk us through
       the whole process.

09:20.194 --> 09:22.928
      Well, first I'll fill
   the syringe with silicone.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.830
       Once you've decided
     what part of your body

09:24.932 --> 09:26.098
      you'd like enhanced,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.133
     I'll inject the syringe
          strategically

09:28.235 --> 09:29.267
    to create a fuller look.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.970
     Now, you'll have to be
           very still

09:32.072 --> 09:33.205
  for this part of the process.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.974
          If you move,
      I could go too deep.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.110
  And trust me, you don't want
       this in your blood.

09:38.212 --> 09:40.846
 It can cause a ton of problems.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.280
       You remember Lisa?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.282
         The one that's
     always breathing heavy.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.817
              Yeah.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.185
It ain't 'cause of asthma, girl.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.887
      Now, there's gonna be
          some swelling

09:48.989 --> 09:50.889
     at the injection site,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.291
       but that's normal.
  Nothing a Tylenol can't cure.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.161
      -Superglue will stop
          the bleeding.
           -Superglue?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.996
     That's for fixing runs
        in my stockings,

10:00.100 --> 10:03.235

    about the work I've done.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.137
    I think I'm gonna do it.

10:05.239 --> 10:07.072
             -Yeah.
          -No, hold up.
  You can't just cut the line.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.306
      -Oh, now she want to.
        -I'm going first.

10:13.247 --> 10:14.980
     I need to look natural.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.148
    We'll start with a liter.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.116
      One half on each side
          of your body.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.951
              Done.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.087
       That'll be $1,000.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.855

19:16.613 --> 19:18.847
      I don't even know why
        I'm helping you,

19:18.949 --> 19:21.883
      considering the coal
       I got on Christmas.

19:21.985 --> 19:23.885
    Stop playing the martyr;
       you're my daughter,

19:23.987 --> 19:25.787
       and daughters live
     to serve their mothers.

19:25.889 --> 19:27.622
       Little do you know
      that you contributed

19:27.724 --> 19:30.559
     to something monumental
           in my life.

19:30.661 --> 19:33.628
    I was planning on getting
  my transsexualism operation.

19:33.730 --> 19:36.898
  I saved all my money and was
  sure I was ready to go under.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.633
         I must confess.

19:38.735 --> 19:41.736
 Children, Mother lost her way.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.939
 I forgot that I was a unicorn.

19:44.041 --> 19:46.808
         Preach, Mother.
    There's only one Elektra.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.577
            Besides,

19:48.679 --> 19:51.546
  my man wants me just as I am
          and so do I.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.615
    Why mess with perfection?

19:53.717 --> 19:54.783
           Oh, my God.

19:54.885 --> 19:58.587
           -Girl. No.
             -What?

19:58.689 --> 20:01.723
     Candy, who do you think
      you're fooling with?

20:01.825 --> 20:03.692
 I'm not trying to fool nobody.

20:03.794 --> 20:04.993
        I'm serving body.

20:05.095 --> 20:06.728
    This is how I see myself.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.963
   You are not going out there

20:08.065 --> 20:10.732
 and embarrassing my good name,
            my house.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.601
        This is ballroom.

20:12.703 --> 20:15.604
 Categories were created so that
we could live out our fantasies.

20:15.706 --> 20:17.606
 We get to be who we want to be.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.975
      And this is the image
       I want to project.

20:20.077 --> 20:21.977
     That image is shattered
         and distorted.

20:22.079 --> 20:24.913
If you're going to serve a look,
    it must be suited to you.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.682
     It must be streamlined
         and flattering.

20:27.784 --> 20:31.686
  Most of all, it must be <i> real.</i>

20:31.788 --> 20:33.989
    Hmm. As real as that wig
          on your head?

20:34.091 --> 20:37.659
            Real? Ha.

20:37.761 --> 20:38.793
      These legs are real.

20:38.896 --> 20:40.629
   These cheekbones are real.

20:40.731 --> 20:41.897
  This whittled waist is real.

20:41.999 --> 20:43.865
    I will never judge a girl
        for enhancements,

20:43.967 --> 20:45.767
    but they need to convince
      a skeptical audience

20:45.869 --> 20:47.035
    searching for falsities.

20:47.137 --> 20:49.671
 And <i> you</i> are convincing no one.

20:49.773 --> 20:51.573
   If you walk out that door,

20:51.675 --> 20:53.041
  you might as well be walking
       as an Evangelista,

20:53.143 --> 20:55.911
  because I only raise winners.

20:56.013 --> 20:57.913
           -Oh, yeah?
 -LULU: Have you lost your mind?
         -LAMAR: Uh-uh.

20:58.015 --> 20:59.814
         Fuck her, Lulu.

20:59.917 --> 21:03.919

     Excuse me, Miss Candy.

21:45.696 --> 21:46.828
      Okay, stop the music.

   Audience, audience, today,

21:54.838 --> 21:56.771
      Miss Candy Abundance
      has made a discovery.

21:56.873 --> 21:58.840
     Groundbreaking, truly.

21:58.942 --> 22:02.677
   She has created the world's
        largest maxi pad

22:02.779 --> 22:04.846
 -and tied it around her waist.
      -(laughter, groaning)

22:04.948 --> 22:06.848
           I am real.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.950
    Oh, is that what that is?

22:09.052 --> 22:10.952
     It's padding all right.

22:11.054 --> 22:13.788
 And she got a super heavy flow
      from the feel of it.

22:13.890 --> 22:17.525
            -Come on.
 -Break that up. Break that up.

22:17.628 --> 22:18.860
   We're not doing that here.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.829
  My advice to you, Miss Candy,

22:20.931 --> 22:23.565
      is to pull them socks
          out your bra,

22:23.667 --> 22:25.634
  give your mama back her pads,

22:25.736 --> 22:28.603
    and think long and hard,
           Miss Girly,

22:28.705 --> 22:30.805
        about a category
   that you can actually win.

   Why don't you take that mic
          and shove it

22:35.979 --> 22:37.979
        up your loose ass
      and go fuck yourself?

25:50.807 --> 25:53.575
  you wore a black cutout dress

      I finally felt whole.

28:12.782 --> 28:14.849
      Shit, we <i> are</i> the real
          <i> Dreamgirls.</i>

28:14.951 --> 28:17.752
           (sniffles)

28:21.742 --> 28:23.341
       Aha. Mr. Richards.

28:23.444 --> 28:25.544
      So the nurse tells me
        you have a fever.

28:25.646 --> 28:27.579
         Never fear. Dr.

28:27.681 --> 28:30.682
        <i> Love...</i> is here.

28:30.784 --> 28:32.984
            (laughs)

28:34.588 --> 28:37.556
         (Damon laughs)

28:37.658 --> 28:39.658
           Still 102.
        How you feeling?

28:39.760 --> 28:40.859
            Terrible.

28:40.961 --> 28:42.861
  Then why are you getting up?

28:42.963 --> 28:45.597
     I can't miss rehearsal.

28:45.699 --> 28:49.468
    (sighs) I promised Helena
  that I wouldn't let her down.

28:49.570 --> 28:52.971
 Blanca can call her and explain
  that you're not feeling well.

28:54.808 --> 28:57.776
    Hey. Now get back in bed.

28:57.878 --> 28:59.511
   If this fever doesn't break
          by tomorrow,

28:59.613 --> 29:00.745
         I'm taking you
       to see the doctor.

29:00.848 --> 29:02.848
            Come on.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.551
            -(sighs)
             -What?

29:06.653 --> 29:07.853
    Ricky, are you negative?

29:07.955 --> 29:09.855
            (laughs)
       You don't have HIV.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.923
       Now get some sleep.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.496
   Ricky, answer the question.

29:20.601 --> 29:22.501
          I'm not sure.

29:22.603 --> 29:24.503
        I don't think so.

29:24.605 --> 29:26.671
    What does that even mean?

29:26.773 --> 29:29.541
            It means
     I've never been tested.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.779
       But we've had sex.

29:34.882 --> 29:36.915
           <i> -Safe</i> sex.
        -Not every time.

29:37.017 --> 29:38.683
   Well, whose fault is that?

29:38.785 --> 29:40.619
    You said it felt better.

29:42.890 --> 29:44.789
     I should have listened
          to Lil Papi.

29:44.892 --> 29:47.526
    -He warned me about you.
         -What the fuck
    is that supposed to mean?

29:47.628 --> 29:48.760
         How many people
      have you slept with?

29:48.862 --> 29:51.530
          I don't know.
           Like... 50?

29:51.632 --> 29:53.532
               50?

29:53.634 --> 29:55.834
              -50?!
            -(sighs)

29:55.936 --> 29:57.636
      Oh, my God. Oh, my...

29:57.738 --> 29:58.870
           Oh, my God.

29:58.972 --> 30:00.906
    -You should have told me.
         -And if I had,

30:01.008 --> 30:03.475
  what would it have changed?!

30:03.577 --> 30:06.578
  The only way you can get HIV
   is if you're the receiver.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.914
       I've only bottomed,
        like, two times.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.716
          Listen to me.

30:11.818 --> 30:15.654
      If you were positive,
  I'd be showing symptoms, too.

30:15.756 --> 30:17.556
     BLANCA: <i> You should have</i>
      <i> heard them talking,</i>

30:17.658 --> 30:19.591
        <i> like not knowing</i>
       <i> is an okay thing.</i>

30:19.693 --> 30:21.726
         -They're young.
   -(scoffs) That's my point.

30:21.828 --> 30:24.596
They don't know shit about shit.
   It's my job to teach them.

30:24.698 --> 30:25.897
        What's the point
      in being their mother

30:25.999 --> 30:27.599
          if I can't do
        what I need to do

30:27.701 --> 30:28.867
         to protect them
       from the one thing

30:28.969 --> 30:30.902
 we all know is coming for 'em?

30:31.004 --> 30:32.737
    Teach 'em to be careful.

30:32.839 --> 30:34.539
           They kids.

30:34.641 --> 30:36.908
      Most of the grown men
     we know aren't careful.

30:38.845 --> 30:41.746
    They got to get checked,
  and not just for their sake.

30:41.848 --> 30:43.949
        They need to know
 so they don't hurt nobody else.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.786
    I stopped getting tested.

30:49.723 --> 30:50.789
              What?

30:50.891 --> 30:52.791
     After Costas got sick,

30:52.893 --> 30:57.596
      and I saw how the AZT
        made him sicker.

30:57.698 --> 30:59.731
       He's not the first.

30:59.833 --> 31:01.633
    I know about five people

31:01.735 --> 31:03.868
   where the drugs killed 'em
      before the virus did.

31:03.971 --> 31:05.737
    But you don't know that.

31:05.839 --> 31:08.740
    I know that Ronald Reagan
  will not say the word "AIDS."

31:08.842 --> 31:10.609
              -I...
        -Health insurance

31:10.711 --> 31:12.677
 will not cover any treatments.

31:12.779 --> 31:14.846
    The world wants us dead.

31:14.948 --> 31:18.516
        They don't think
        this is a plague.

31:18.619 --> 31:21.553
    They think it's some sort
        of divine justice

31:21.655 --> 31:24.923
 or Darwin's answer for sodomy.

31:26.860 --> 31:30.528
      I used to get tested
 every month, but now I just...

31:30.664 --> 31:32.864
     I'm just extra careful
      when I do what I do,

31:32.966 --> 31:35.700
   and I am... living my life.

31:35.802 --> 31:37.869
        You're whistling
       past the graveyard.

31:37.971 --> 31:40.872
     Maybe! But you knowing
      and me not knowing--

31:40.974 --> 31:43.541
 it's not gonna change the fact
       that at some point,

31:43.644 --> 31:44.976
    this shit is gonna run us
            all down.

31:45.078 --> 31:46.878
     You are one pessimistic
   motherfucker, I'll tell ya.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.648
         I'm a realist.

31:51.084 --> 31:53.485
        -And I'm scared.
        -I know you are.

31:53.587 --> 31:55.453
    But what is scared to us?

31:55.555 --> 31:57.522
   It's like water to a fish.

31:59.893 --> 32:01.860
        There's no point
      in dreaming of a life

32:01.962 --> 32:03.762
  without having to be scared.

32:03.864 --> 32:06.464
     But you're also strong
           and brave.

32:06.566 --> 32:07.932
          Brave enough
     to get up on that stage

32:08.035 --> 32:12.671
      and take on all of us
crazy bitches night after night.

32:12.773 --> 32:14.472
  We are all gonna get tested,

32:14.574 --> 32:16.975
      and we are all gonna
  get through this... together.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.339
PRAY TELL: <i> It's good to see you,</i>
    <i> Damon. How you feeling?</i>

32:31.442 --> 32:32.774
      That fever took hold
          of your soul.

32:32.876 --> 32:35.677
        I know. Six days
    before it finally broke.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.712
         But I'm feeling
       like myself again.

32:37.815 --> 32:41.583
Went to my first dance rehearsal
 today, and I feel pretty good.

32:41.685 --> 32:45.921
  Glad to hear it, and I'm glad
  you guys could join me today.

32:46.023 --> 32:47.923
  What's the special occasion?

32:48.025 --> 32:50.592
   <i> We</i> are going to get tested
            for HIV.

32:50.694 --> 32:53.595
  And I don't want to hear any,
  "I don't need to be tested."

32:53.697 --> 32:56.765
   You're going, you're going,
          you're going.

32:56.867 --> 32:58.733
    We need to know our stats

32:58.836 --> 33:01.403
         so we can stop
     spreading this disease.

33:01.505 --> 33:03.672
         I want to know.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.841
    And if we do it together,

33:05.943 --> 33:09.611
      it'll be less scary.

33:11.915 --> 33:14.449
     Don't you want to know?

33:14.551 --> 33:15.851
          I'm not sure.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.853
            I guess.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.555
    -You coming, too, right?
      -Oh, he doesn't need
         to get tested.

33:20.657 --> 33:22.591
 -He's not running the streets.
         -I think I do.

33:22.693 --> 33:24.626
      But you can't get it
          from a woman.

33:24.728 --> 33:26.895
  Listen, I prefer the ladies,

33:26.997 --> 33:28.897
             but I'm
   an equal opportunity lover.

33:28.999 --> 33:31.466
 -Ain't nothing wrong with that.
        -DAMON: But wait.

33:31.568 --> 33:32.767
      If you're being safe,
   you shouldn't have anything

33:32.870 --> 33:35.437
     -to worry about, right?
        -Back in the day,

33:35.539 --> 33:37.472
     when I was real hard up
            for cash,

33:37.574 --> 33:38.807
   I'd let dudes suck my dick.

33:38.909 --> 33:40.809
   PRAY TELL: The symptoms are
    different with everybody.

33:40.911 --> 33:43.778
  I have friends who have been
  diagnosed and are just fine.

33:43.881 --> 33:45.714
     And then, I had friends
        who dropped dead

33:45.816 --> 33:47.449
    because they didn't know
          they had it.

33:47.551 --> 33:50.986
        Once it's in you,
    you're on borrowed time.

33:52.789 --> 33:54.823
             ANGEL:
     You sure this is legit?

33:54.925 --> 33:56.858
             CANDY:
   You know that girl Revlon?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.727
    That ass is fine as shit.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.463
       She said this lady,
   Ms. Orlando, gave it to her

34:01.565 --> 34:03.832
         for ten percent
  of what that Clarissa charge.

34:05.969 --> 34:08.603
            I mean...

34:08.705 --> 34:10.871
        is... this safe?

34:12.676 --> 34:14.876
  We gonna breathe funny after?

34:14.978 --> 34:17.746
   Beggars can't be choosers.
            Come on.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.581
             Uh-uh.

34:19.683 --> 34:20.782
            Come on!

34:20.884 --> 34:22.583
          MS. ORLANDO:
         <i> The good Lord</i>

34:22.686 --> 34:25.554
       made all the girls
 that want to be skinny... fat,

34:25.656 --> 34:28.456
   and all the girls that want
      to be fat... skinny.

34:28.559 --> 34:32.893
     But Ms. Orlando is here
      to make things right.

34:34.598 --> 34:36.731
            (inhales)
              Ooh.

34:36.833 --> 34:40.668
        Don't be jealous
        of a perfect mug.

34:40.771 --> 34:43.572
 How come you're less than half
     the price of Clarissa?

34:43.674 --> 34:45.806
        Because Clarissa
        get her silicone

34:45.909 --> 34:47.842
          from a doctor
     on the Upper West Side.

34:47.945 --> 34:53.447
  I go down to Honduras and get
   the same shit for pennies.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.748
         The exact same?

34:54.851 --> 34:57.786
 Eh... there's some differences,

34:57.888 --> 35:00.388
         but I add some
      of my own ingredients

35:00.490 --> 35:03.391
      -to make it the same.
           -Like what?

35:03.493 --> 35:04.759
        Are you guys here
       to get beautified,

35:04.861 --> 35:08.797
           or to steal
     my proprietary secrets?

35:08.899 --> 35:10.432
              Hmm.

35:10.534 --> 35:13.602
 You can't pass without curves.

35:13.704 --> 35:15.604
      I say this with love.

35:15.706 --> 35:17.539
           Look at me.

35:17.641 --> 35:19.774
   Men throw themselves at me.

35:19.876 --> 35:25.647
   Every man wants a plump lip
     and a luscious breast.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.649
     Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait.

35:29.519 --> 35:30.852
        I got cash. See?

35:30.954 --> 35:34.522
I want breasts, and I want hips.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.626
   I need to look like a Coke
  bottle, but with big titties.

35:37.728 --> 35:39.828
      -Wonderful. (inhales)
        -(snaps fingers)

35:39.930 --> 35:42.764
  I'm gonna give you four shots
          in your hips,

35:42.866 --> 35:44.766
        but then you have
        to move it around

35:44.868 --> 35:47.569
          so it's even
      before it gets hard.

35:47.671 --> 35:49.904
           Okay. What?
      You want to go first?

35:51.708 --> 35:53.408
               No.

35:53.510 --> 35:55.844
   Nah. I'm gonna skip today,

35:55.946 --> 35:58.647
    see how it goes with you.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.783
          Hey, come on.
         Lay down there.

36:01.885 --> 36:04.386
             -Okay.
         -Are you ready?

36:04.488 --> 36:07.756
    Wait. Okay. Hold my hand.

36:07.858 --> 36:09.691
        Okay, I'm ready.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.793
            -(sighs)
              -Hmm.

36:11.895 --> 36:13.862
   I'm gonna make you pretty.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.599
           -ANGEL: Oh.
              -Ooh.

36:17.701 --> 36:19.668
            LIL PAPI:
 I was never any good at tests.

36:19.770 --> 36:22.537
      PRAY TELL (chuckles):
        Yeah, me neither.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.774
  But there's power in knowing.
         Remember that.

36:25.876 --> 36:27.575
         And, you know,
  in two weeks' time, we'll...

36:27.678 --> 36:29.811
 we'll find out we pass, right?

36:29.913 --> 36:31.579
             -Yeah.
           -(chuckles)

36:31.682 --> 36:34.482
           Number 53.

45:44.726 --> 45:46.526
  I went to a porno book store.

45:46.628 --> 45:48.495
  <i> It was one of those big ones</i>
        <i> in Times Square</i>

45:48.597 --> 45:50.563
      <i> that has everything.</i>

45:50.666 --> 45:52.532
     I owned one old <i> Playboy</i>
         since I was 14;

45:52.634 --> 45:54.467
    I wanted to get something
         more hard-core.

45:54.569 --> 45:57.637
    <i> There was one section of</i>
   <i> magazines off to the side,</i>

45:57.739 --> 45:59.472
    <i> and they were wrapped up</i>
        <i> in brown paper,</i>

45:59.574 --> 46:02.676
     <i> but I could still see</i>
           <i> the title.</i>

46:02.778 --> 46:05.478
    I got all hot in the face
          and nervous,

46:05.580 --> 46:09.482
       but it also made me
         a little hard.

46:09.584 --> 46:11.484
  <i> And it made no sense to me.</i>

46:11.586 --> 46:14.788
 <i> I never thought about anything</i>
       <i> like that before.</i>

46:17.759 --> 46:21.528
   I'm a pornographic magazine
          come to life.

46:21.630 --> 46:23.330
        That's not fair,
     that's not what I said.

46:23.432 --> 46:24.698
    Am I real to you at all?

46:24.800 --> 46:26.733
   Yes, you're more than real
             to me.

46:26.835 --> 46:29.602
         (Angel scoffs)

46:29.705 --> 46:31.304
      Angel, don't do this.

46:31.406 --> 46:32.772
       What are you doing?

46:35.610 --> 46:38.378
    Get out of my apartment.

46:39.448 --> 46:42.449
               No.

46:42.551 --> 46:45.685
            Get out!

46:47.456 --> 46:50.390
       You piece of shit!

47:06.708 --> 47:09.442
             (sighs)
   Sorry to keep you waiting.

47:09.544 --> 47:12.479
      Damon, your HIV exam
       came back negative.

47:12.581 --> 47:14.347
            (exhales)

47:14.449 --> 47:16.282
         (laughs, claps)

47:16.385 --> 47:17.684
        Thank you, Jesus,
        thank you, Je...

47:17.786 --> 47:19.352
           -Thank you.
            -(laughs)

47:19.454 --> 47:20.520
              Hmm.

47:23.692 --> 47:25.658
      (door opens, closes)

47:31.666 --> 47:32.632
          (door opens)

47:32.734 --> 47:34.434
           Number 42.

47:42.644 --> 47:45.311
    I'll feel better when I,
   when I find out about you.

47:45.414 --> 47:46.513
             RICKY:
             Mm-hmm.

47:46.615 --> 47:48.415
              -Yes.
         -(Damon laughs)

47:48.517 --> 47:50.316
              Yes.

47:50.419 --> 47:52.385
            (laughs)

47:53.722 --> 47:55.622
               53?

47:57.626 --> 47:59.626
 I promise I'll always be safe.

47:59.728 --> 48:01.394
     I've learned my lesson.

48:03.331 --> 48:04.697
           Thank you.

48:04.800 --> 48:08.435
      (door opens, closes)

48:13.408 --> 48:14.707
          I'm negative.

48:14.810 --> 48:16.476
            (exhales)

48:16.578 --> 48:18.244
           -(kissing)
           -LINA: 28.

48:18.346 --> 48:19.345
               Oh.

48:19.448 --> 48:20.613
    Hey, I'll be right back.

48:23.385 --> 48:25.452
  LINA: <i> We detected antibodies</i>
         <i> in your blood.</i>

48:25.554 --> 48:27.620
       Yeah, uh, you have
     to run the test again.

48:27.722 --> 48:29.322
  It could be a false positive.

48:29.424 --> 48:31.291
        I can assure you
        we ran it twice.

48:31.393 --> 48:33.359
   The results were the same.

48:33.462 --> 48:34.527
      You're HIV positive.

48:34.629 --> 48:36.596
           I'm sorry.

48:42.471 --> 48:44.537
            (exhales)

48:44.639 --> 48:47.307
         This is the...

48:47.409 --> 48:51.211
       this is the moment
      that I dreaded most.

48:51.313 --> 48:55.215
      Dodged it, for years.

48:55.317 --> 48:58.585
 And now the son of a bitch has
   finally caught up with me.

48:58.687 --> 49:00.286
            (crying)

49:02.357 --> 49:04.324
            (laughs)

49:06.461 --> 49:08.394
           Oh, my God.

49:08.497 --> 49:10.597
       (exhales, sniffles)

49:10.699 --> 49:13.500
      Well, there's no use
     in shedding good tears

49:13.602 --> 49:15.668
         over something
    you can't change, right?

49:19.508 --> 49:21.407
            (crying):
           Oh, my God.

49:21.510 --> 49:26.346
      Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

49:26.448 --> 49:28.348
            (exhales)

49:28.450 --> 49:29.549
  I got to pull myself together

49:29.651 --> 49:31.518
      before I go back out
         to those boys.

49:31.620 --> 49:33.353
 I got to pull myself together.

49:33.455 --> 49:35.321
          Could you...

49:35.423 --> 49:38.458
   -Can I just have a minute,
         please, alone?
        -LINA: Of course.

49:46.568 --> 49:49.536
           Oh, my God.
            (crying)

49:51.640 --> 49:52.705
           (chuckles)

49:52.807 --> 49:54.674
      (door opens, closes)

49:56.444 --> 49:59.379
        It was negative.
         I-I'm negative.

49:59.481 --> 50:01.381
              -Ooh.
             -Nice.

50:01.483 --> 50:03.449
           (laughter)

50:06.421 --> 50:08.788
        (Pray Tell sighs)

50:10.692 --> 50:13.593
      So let's, um, go-go,
      uh, celebrate, right?

50:13.695 --> 50:14.694
              -Yes.
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

50:14.796 --> 50:16.663
          (hands clap)

50:16.765 --> 50:19.299
           (laughter)

50:19.401 --> 50:21.367
          (door opens)

50:30.269 --> 50:32.736
             Mm. Mm!
            (giggles)

50:32.838 --> 50:35.505
    You got to take a picture
 of this one for your flipbook.

50:35.607 --> 50:37.641
      Plans, plans, plans.

50:37.743 --> 50:39.643
        Blanca is always
        about her plans.

50:39.745 --> 50:43.246
           I am sorry
   if I am happy and hopeful.

50:43.348 --> 50:45.449
       I'm about to go see
         <i> my</i> child perform

50:45.551 --> 50:47.217
 for all of those civilized folk

50:47.319 --> 50:51.588
    wearing this magnificent
    creation you made for me.

50:51.690 --> 50:56.626
   Damon is getting his shot,
    all of y'all are healthy.

50:56.728 --> 50:59.429
     Life isn't always good,
         but right now,

50:59.531 --> 51:03.366
   in this moment, it's good.

51:03.469 --> 51:04.668
         (laughs softly)

51:07.639 --> 51:09.673
             I lied.

51:13.545 --> 51:15.512
           About what?

51:17.549 --> 51:20.517
    I lied about my results.

51:35.767 --> 51:39.469
    (exhales, clears throat)

51:39.571 --> 51:41.638
  Pray Tell, are you positive?

51:44.443 --> 51:47.611
     Why would you lie about
      something like that?

51:48.680 --> 51:50.447
         You know what?

51:50.549 --> 51:52.649
        Who am I to ask?

51:52.751 --> 51:57.420
    But now I'm gonna end up
 in some hospital, wasting away.

51:57.523 --> 52:00.323
     With a nurse who won't
        bring me my food.

52:00.425 --> 52:02.526
      Oh, stop saying that.

52:02.628 --> 52:05.228
         But it's true.
    It's true. We've seen it.

52:05.330 --> 52:06.630
      They don't know shit
      about this thing yet,

52:06.732 --> 52:09.499
   which means they don't know
     if it's incurable yet.

52:09.601 --> 52:11.334
        Baby, they don't
        want to cure it.

52:11.436 --> 52:13.570
       Of course they do.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.505
         Somebody does.

52:15.607 --> 52:18.308
       Win the Nobel Prize
        and all of that.

52:18.410 --> 52:22.312
     And you and I are gonna
    take care of each other,

52:22.414 --> 52:26.449
      and we are gonna find
    every treatment and drug,

52:26.552 --> 52:31.254
    and we are gonna survive
       as long as we can.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.589
    I'm not ready to die yet.

52:32.691 --> 52:35.392
          Me, neither.

52:38.597 --> 52:40.597
           (sniffles)

52:40.699 --> 52:45.302
  Before we discuss scheduling,
  it's my duty to talk through

52:45.404 --> 52:47.604
      preparation, surgery
     and aftercare with you.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.507
      But let's start with
 the questions you have for me.

52:50.609 --> 52:52.209
      How bad will it hurt?

52:52.311 --> 52:53.443
       Most of my patients
          only remember

52:53.545 --> 52:55.345
 waking up in the recovery room.

52:55.447 --> 52:57.214
       You won't be alone.

52:57.316 --> 52:59.416
 You'll have a team of the best
       taking care of you,

52:59.518 --> 53:00.584
          including me.

53:07.359 --> 53:09.326
           (sniffles)

53:15.534 --> 53:18.235
           (sniffles)

53:18.337 --> 53:20.437
    I've always had someone.

53:20.539 --> 53:25.475
 I've always had him by my side,
       taking care of me.

53:25.577 --> 53:27.377
       I've been with him
         for ten years.

53:27.479 --> 53:30.380
          That's rare.

53:30.482 --> 53:32.382
           (sniffles)

53:32.484 --> 53:35.652
 Do you know what I'm giving up
       to go through this?

53:37.723 --> 53:40.357
           (sniffles)

53:40.459 --> 53:42.392
       I can only imagine
         the sacrifices

53:42.494 --> 53:44.594
     you've made to be here,

53:44.696 --> 53:48.398
  but it's never a bad decision
       to choose yourself.

53:48.500 --> 53:50.500
       You will feel free.

53:50.602 --> 53:54.471
 I've seen it with my own eyes.

53:54.573 --> 53:57.540
      I marvel every time.

53:58.777 --> 54:00.744
           (sniffling)

54:04.716 --> 54:06.616
