00:02.583 --> 00:03.674
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.674 --> 00:04.885
Uh, Thomas, I'm --
Can we pause for a second?

00:04.885 --> 00:05.836
Till date number two?

00:05.836 --> 00:07.128
The police
are at my apartment.

00:07.128 --> 00:07.968
Are they still there?

00:07.968 --> 00:09.180
Yeah.
They're from New York.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.011
Miss? Is that him?
No.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.683
This is Frank --
He gave the police your name

00:12.683 --> 00:14.265
to make you a suspect.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.847
A detective called looking
for Wes Gibbins.

00:16.847 --> 00:18.639
He was absent
from class today.

00:18.639 --> 00:19.980
I just have
to tell the police

00:19.980 --> 00:22.063
I went to New York
on my own.

00:22.063 --> 00:25.696
The suspect in custody
is Wallace Mahoney's own son,

00:25.696 --> 00:26.697
Charles Mahoney.

00:26.697 --> 00:27.568
Frank.

00:27.568 --> 00:28.279
I told you --

00:28.279 --> 00:29.320
He just wants to come home.

00:34.825 --> 00:36.997
Annalise Keating,
you're under arrest.

00:41.292 --> 00:42.123
No!

00:52.383 --> 00:53.554
You sure you don't
want us to wait

00:53.554 --> 00:54.305
for your attorney?

00:54.305 --> 00:55.436
Just tell me.

00:55.436 --> 00:57.228
The official
charge --

00:57.228 --> 00:58.729
arson
and first-degree murder.

01:03.774 --> 01:04.775
The evidence?

01:04.775 --> 01:06.447
An anonymous source.

01:06.447 --> 01:09.820
They've provided information
that ties you to the charges.

01:13.534 --> 01:14.745
Now do you want
your attorney?

01:18.999 --> 01:21.332
You lost your phone?

01:21.332 --> 01:23.624
Last I had it
was at the library.

01:23.624 --> 01:25.966
You must have been in contact
with your girlfriend,

01:25.966 --> 01:27.047
Meggy Travers.

01:27.047 --> 01:29.630
We actually broke up.

01:29.630 --> 01:31.972
To be clear,
my client contacted you

01:31.972 --> 01:33.514
the minute he heard
you were looking for him.

01:33.514 --> 01:35.266
Now he's reaffirmed
his original statement

01:35.266 --> 01:36.096
about the shooting.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.639
So...can we go?

01:38.639 --> 01:40.601
Any chance
you saw this man

01:40.601 --> 01:43.023
during the scene
of the shooting?

01:43.023 --> 01:45.896
You've had that man in custody
for days now.

01:45.896 --> 01:48.899
Clearly, you have
enough evidence against him.

01:48.899 --> 01:50.191
Wes?
Don't speak to my --

01:50.191 --> 01:52.533
I saw him...

01:52.533 --> 01:54.995
standing in a doorway
across the street.

01:54.995 --> 01:58.199
I remember because I was gonna
ask him for directions,

01:58.199 --> 02:02.663
but he looked upset,
so I crossed the street and...

02:06.086 --> 02:07.047
You know
what happened then.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.762
You're mad.

02:21.762 --> 02:23.434
So you agree I have the right
to be pissed off at you?

02:23.434 --> 02:25.936
I wouldn't
have said any--
You lied. Why?

02:25.936 --> 02:27.318
If Charles
were your client,

02:27.318 --> 02:29.230
you'd have that gun thrown out
before we even got to trial.

02:29.230 --> 02:30.901
It's got
his fingerprints on it.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.404
Who shoots their father
and doesn't get rid of the gun?

02:33.404 --> 02:35.486
How do you know
Charles doesn't have an alibi?

02:35.486 --> 02:37.948
That this wasn't just their way
of catching you in a lie?

02:37.948 --> 02:38.779
Tell me.

02:43.544 --> 02:46.417
It's okay.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.708
Is it?

02:47.708 --> 02:48.919
Yeah, I called Eve,

02:48.919 --> 02:50.961
and the NYPD's
only interested in Charles.

02:50.961 --> 02:54.295
It's a good headline
for them.

02:54.295 --> 02:55.506
Have you heard
from Frank?

02:55.506 --> 02:56.927
No.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.300
Maybe we got lucky
and he killed himself.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.473
Come on,
our client's waiting.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.017
They couldn't figure out
what was wrong with me.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.939
Finally, they tested my blood

03:08.939 --> 03:13.814
and realized I had been
poisoned with antifreeze.

03:13.814 --> 03:16.737
What would you like to say
to those who did this to you?

03:16.737 --> 03:18.279
I've searched my soul,

03:18.279 --> 03:22.993
but there's no understanding
any of this.

03:22.993 --> 03:26.627
What kind of children
try to kill their own mother?

03:26.627 --> 03:29.039
That whole interview
was an Oscar performance.

03:29.039 --> 03:30.291
Mr. Duvall.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.212
She's no probably
not even sick.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.965
Jared,
back me up on this.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.177
She's not a nice lady.

03:37.177 --> 03:38.509
We don't care.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.050
Listen, from here on out,

03:40.050 --> 03:41.392
the only feelings you have
for your mother

03:41.392 --> 03:43.804
are love and devotion.

03:43.804 --> 03:45.436
The prosecution has forced us

03:45.436 --> 03:47.518
into holding depositions
before the trial.

03:47.518 --> 03:51.352
Their excuse is that Edith
can die at any time,

03:51.352 --> 03:53.564
so it would be
in our best interest

03:53.564 --> 03:55.316
to get the case out pre-trial --

03:55.316 --> 03:58.238
not an easy task
considering the evidence.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.910
Is it true
that you and your siblings

03:59.910 --> 04:01.702
exchanged text messages
about killing your mother?

04:01.702 --> 04:02.993
We were joking.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.825
So you're claiming
the text,

04:04.825 --> 04:06.287
"Let's cut off her head
and boil it

04:06.287 --> 04:07.708
in the slow cooker
with the chili"

04:07.708 --> 04:08.959
was a joke?

04:08.959 --> 04:10.291
If you knew how much Mom
loves chili,

04:10.291 --> 04:12.293
you'd get why that's funny.

04:12.293 --> 04:16.046
Edith will be present
at all the depositions.

04:16.046 --> 04:18.379
This is a ploy
by the prosecution

04:18.379 --> 04:19.840
to trigger our clients

04:19.840 --> 04:22.262
into saying something stupid
on camera.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.765
Quite possible considering
who we're dealing with.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.767
So you guys had family dinner
at the restaurant once a week,

04:26.767 --> 04:27.808
was that right?

04:27.808 --> 04:29.440
If we didn't show,
even just once,

04:29.440 --> 04:30.651
we'd be removed the will.

04:30.651 --> 04:32.313
Jared, that's an example
of a question

04:32.313 --> 04:34.104
you might want to just answer
with a yes or no.

04:34.104 --> 04:35.736
Excuse me,
I'm in the middle of my prep.

04:35.736 --> 04:37.608
And I'm just trying to make sure
that our client understands

04:37.608 --> 04:39.069
the full weight of each
and every one of his responses.

04:39.069 --> 04:40.451
Yeah, I understand.

04:40.451 --> 04:41.492
Great.

04:41.492 --> 04:43.364
But I do want to warn
each of you

04:43.364 --> 04:46.907
that Mom
is a genius manipulator.

04:46.907 --> 04:48.869
Show any weakness
in front of her,

04:48.869 --> 04:51.251
and she'll use it
to her advantage.

04:51.251 --> 04:52.913
The key to beating this

04:52.913 --> 04:56.717
is to make the sure the siblings
present a united front.

04:56.717 --> 04:59.510
Is it possible
one of your brothers did this?

04:59.510 --> 05:01.802
No, Nelson and Jared
both love our mother dearly.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.683
And you?

05:02.683 --> 05:04.094
Of course.

05:04.094 --> 05:07.478
Really? Even though
her pet name for you was

05:07.478 --> 05:09.350
"Big Kahunas Karen"?

05:09.350 --> 05:10.981
They need to speak
in detail

05:10.981 --> 05:12.893
about their affection
for their mother.

05:12.893 --> 05:14.645
I had matured quite early,

05:14.645 --> 05:16.567
but she wouldn't let me
wear a bra.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.939
Instead, she just came up
with the nickname.

05:18.939 --> 05:22.823
"Half Nelson" because she said
it fit my below-average IQ.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.246
"Jerky Jared" 'cause she
caught me masturbating once.

05:26.246 --> 05:27.948
This is a woman
who read my diary

05:27.948 --> 05:30.541
in front of all the employees
at a staff meeting.

05:30.541 --> 05:33.083
If she smells blood,
she goes in for the kill.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.005
So you did
want her dead?

05:35.005 --> 05:38.338
You tell me who did it,
and I'll buy him a drink.

05:40.921 --> 05:42.673
Any of you get some major
Keating vibes in there?

05:42.673 --> 05:43.924
What are you
talking about?

05:43.924 --> 05:45.766
A controlling, sadistic
power-monger

05:45.766 --> 05:48.138
who lies to her kids' faces,
verbally abusive.

05:48.138 --> 05:49.560
Did you just admit
you want to poison Annalise?

05:49.560 --> 05:50.731
Wha-- No.

05:50.731 --> 05:51.602
This what I heard you say.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.733
- Hmm, me, too.
- Me three.

05:52.733 --> 05:54.354
What a trainwreck.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.276
Whenever you mention
the word "Mommy,"

05:56.276 --> 05:57.818
they turn into
sniveling ingrates.

05:57.818 --> 05:58.859
It would be malpractice

05:58.859 --> 06:00.360
to put them
in front of a camera.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.282
So what?
We file a motion to postpone?

06:02.282 --> 06:04.655
No, we'll float the prosecution
a new suspect

06:04.655 --> 06:07.367
and they'll cancel
the depositions completely.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.200
Look into any disgruntled
restaurant employees first.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.291
Wait --
if there's no deposition,

06:11.291 --> 06:12.413
then there can be
no first chair.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.495
What, you need a prize
in order to do your job?

06:14.495 --> 06:16.046
We just started studying
for midterms, is all.

06:16.046 --> 06:17.127
All right.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.299
Whoever brings me a good suspect

06:19.299 --> 06:20.761
gets an automatic "A"
on my midterm.

06:21.842 --> 06:23.093
Everyone happy?

06:26.266 --> 06:28.008
Here --
If we divide and conquer,

06:28.008 --> 06:30.010
we can look into
every employee in the box.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.222
How are we supposed to
divide and conquer an "A"?

06:32.222 --> 06:33.474
We draw straws.

06:33.474 --> 06:35.105
Ah! Like hell
I'm letting a straw

06:35.105 --> 06:36.477
determine by GPA.

06:36.477 --> 06:38.278
Every woman for herself.

06:38.278 --> 06:40.651
I'm gonna go talk
to this busboy.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.823
Wanna ride?
I'll talk to people, too.

06:42.823 --> 06:44.655
Cool.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.622
They're really
going to kill Frank, right?

06:51.622 --> 06:54.414
Mm, as long they leave us
out of it for once.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.747
Maybe we just tell them
before they find out.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.038
I'm not worried about them,

06:58.038 --> 06:59.630
I'm worried about Annalise.

06:59.630 --> 07:01.542
Don't say that.

07:01.542 --> 07:02.923
She still hates me.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.805
Yeah, but I don't want

07:04.805 --> 07:06.717
to be thinking
about Annalise right now.

07:06.717 --> 07:10.601
Or the fact that you
lied to the police this morning?

07:10.601 --> 07:13.724
Exactly.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.435
Distract me.

07:34.665 --> 07:36.416
Mmm.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.540
Maybe Laurel
should call her dad.

07:39.540 --> 07:42.883
He found Frank once.
Maybe he can do it again.

07:46.346 --> 07:48.589
Or maybe
you need to call him.

07:48.589 --> 07:53.473
Tell him I'm here
to welcome him with open arms.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.765
If he's going to reach out
to any of us,

07:54.765 --> 07:57.227
it's not going to be me.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.559
Why not?

07:58.559 --> 08:00.601
I said things
he didn't take so well.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.192
Like?

08:06.026 --> 08:07.908
That he doesn't
deserve you.

08:11.161 --> 08:13.704
Do you really just want
to wait for him to show up?

08:19.830 --> 08:22.332
I just think better
when I drink.

08:26.046 --> 08:29.890
It's only 6:00.

08:29.890 --> 08:32.052
You've only been once
this week.

08:34.434 --> 08:38.398
A truck driver had called 911,
said I'd fallen asleep.

08:38.398 --> 08:41.642
Nico and Grace
were in the car with me.

08:41.642 --> 08:43.564
I'd picked them up
at the nanny's --

08:49.449 --> 08:51.531
At the nanny's after work --

08:51.531 --> 08:54.655
meaning the happy hour
after work.

08:55.415 --> 08:57.327
Apparently,

08:57.327 --> 09:01.041
I pulled over
to the side of the road,

09:01.041 --> 09:04.374
fell asleep
with the car running.

09:04.374 --> 09:08.338
Nico ran into the street
to wave down help.

09:08.338 --> 09:11.171
My husband, Raul,
filed for custody the next day.

09:11.171 --> 09:12.723
Hope you divorced
his ass.

09:15.385 --> 09:19.600
It's not him I'm mad at.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.061
It's me.

09:25.275 --> 09:27.608
I'm a drunk mother,

09:27.608 --> 09:29.069
and I have to live
with what I put my kids through

09:29.069 --> 09:32.152
for the rest of my life.

09:32.152 --> 09:34.995
Today's my, uh,
one year anniversary.

09:34.995 --> 09:37.077
- Yes.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.000
And I'm doing okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.412
I work my steps.

09:42.412 --> 09:44.915
I see Nico and Grace
twice a week --

09:44.915 --> 09:46.466
Supervised visits.

09:47.708 --> 09:51.672
They're still upset,
and they don't hide it,

09:51.672 --> 09:52.763
and I get it.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.134
They get to be upset
with right now.

09:54.134 --> 09:57.097
They get to hate me right now.

10:03.143 --> 10:05.025
Okay.

10:05.025 --> 10:07.688
On the real,

10:07.688 --> 10:11.111
I'm ashamed of what I did,
of course,

10:11.111 --> 10:14.865
but I'm -- I'm pissed, too.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.699
I'm their mother...

10:22.582 --> 10:26.707
...but they won't even
look me in the eye.

10:26.707 --> 10:31.171
And it just -- it makes me
want to shake them

10:31.171 --> 10:34.885
or yell or something
so that they'll...

10:36.677 --> 10:40.560
...see that I'll do anything
to get them back -- anything.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.392
Oh, I...

10:42.392 --> 10:47.147
I just don't think it means
that I should lose my kids.

10:50.030 --> 10:52.032
-How's Frank?
-What?

10:52.032 --> 10:52.903
That's where you
snuck off to, right?

10:52.903 --> 10:54.074
Are you kidding me?

10:54.074 --> 10:55.235
You do look
a little flush.

10:55.235 --> 10:56.777
Tell me, does the beard
tickle down there?

10:56.777 --> 10:58.158
I'm asking
for a friend.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.580
Did we find
a suspect yet?

11:00.580 --> 11:02.122
The, uh...

11:02.122 --> 11:04.915
busboy
did not pan out.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.167
What?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.249
They think
I was just with Frank.

11:09.249 --> 11:10.380
Maybe you both were
with him.

11:10.380 --> 11:11.962
Oh, two beards,
one girl.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.343
That's hot.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.295
Okay, that --

11:15.295 --> 11:16.887
sexualizing me
without my permission --

11:16.887 --> 11:18.719
is creating
a hostile work environment.

11:18.719 --> 11:19.469
She's right.

11:19.469 --> 11:21.061
Thank you.

11:21.061 --> 11:21.972
Shut up.
We're still not friends.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.263
Michaela.

11:23.263 --> 11:26.476
Ooh! There goes
my "A," bitches.

11:26.476 --> 11:28.478
Okay.

11:28.478 --> 11:30.861
Tell me my waitress
is a known black widow.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.153
Uh, no. She moved to Maine
six months before the poisoning.

11:33.153 --> 11:34.614
But look
what Thomas sent me.

11:34.614 --> 11:36.616
Mm, I thought I was gonna get
to see his penis.

11:36.616 --> 11:38.408
Th-- No!
Thomas isn't like that.

11:38.408 --> 11:40.410
We were talking
about how we hate it

11:40.410 --> 11:42.242
when guys send flowers,
so this is him being ironic.

11:42.242 --> 11:43.033
It's cute.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.374
I choose you,
Hack-a-chu.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.456
Roger Colby,
Produce Manager.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.248
I need you
to hack his killer face.

11:48.248 --> 11:49.539
Yeah, I've got
like 20 other employees

11:49.539 --> 11:50.961
people asked me
to look into, so...

11:50.961 --> 11:53.173
Mm, yet you have time
to send lame text messages

11:53.173 --> 11:54.294
to your acupuncturist.

11:54.294 --> 11:55.756
Oh,
that's still going on?

11:55.756 --> 11:57.838
Yeah, we're going on
our third date tomorrow night.

11:57.838 --> 11:59.760
Ooh! Third date's
the sex date.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.551
You ready to get it in,
or is he the one getting it in?

12:01.551 --> 12:03.053
Shh! Connor'll hear you.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.055
Okay, I was fine with him
cruising Humpr in front of me.

12:05.055 --> 12:07.187
Those were one-offs.

12:07.187 --> 12:10.350
You're really falling
for this guy.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.231
It's not that serious.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.152
Ah!

12:13.814 --> 12:15.275
It's not, guys!
Ohh!

12:15.275 --> 12:17.858
Aww, Little Oli's
a terrible liar.

12:17.858 --> 12:20.070
E-e-e-e.
Go away.
Please, I'm busy.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.202
Are you the one
who signs these?

12:22.202 --> 12:24.414
Yeah.

12:24.414 --> 12:27.537
But I can't sign
until the meeting's over.

12:27.537 --> 12:30.710
Otherwise, half this room
will bail on the break.

12:31.631 --> 12:33.333
Would that be
such a bad thing?

12:35.375 --> 12:37.007
Show your face around here
more often.

12:37.878 --> 12:38.879
I'll hook you up
one time.

12:42.883 --> 12:45.385
Careful.

12:45.385 --> 12:48.228
I hear
he's a 13th stepper.

12:48.228 --> 12:50.480
He screws the new people.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.692
Oh, well, he's barking up
the wrong tree.

12:56.857 --> 12:58.358
That took guts.

12:58.358 --> 13:01.111
Put me in front
of a courtroom, sure.

13:01.111 --> 13:04.955
But spilling my dirt
to strangers...

13:04.955 --> 13:06.666
You'll get there.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.168
Mm, I doubt that.

13:11.001 --> 13:15.795
So, uh, I heard
you got your student a lawyer --

13:15.795 --> 13:17.968
The one the police
were looking for.

13:17.968 --> 13:22.592
I recommended a lawyer.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.594
You need one, too?

13:24.594 --> 13:26.306
Sounds like your husband's
got a pretty good case.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.769
Look, I'm just...
being friendly here

13:29.769 --> 13:31.141
to the point
where I'm questioning

13:31.141 --> 13:32.853
my own self-respect.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.985
You think
I wanna be friends?

13:34.985 --> 13:36.026
Listen, the only reason

13:36.026 --> 13:37.147
I have to come
to these stupid meetings

13:37.147 --> 13:38.358
is because of you.

13:38.358 --> 13:41.321
No, you're here
because you smacked a client.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.823
So let's just
consider a scenario

13:43.823 --> 13:45.825
where I'm not
the enemy here.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.999
I'm just hungry.

13:48.999 --> 13:52.873
Excuse me while I see
about the stale doughnuts.

13:55.085 --> 13:55.795
He's hot, right?

13:57.217 --> 13:58.959
That's the dishwasher
at the restaurant.

13:58.959 --> 14:01.261
Whatever happened to you
being totally against

14:01.261 --> 14:03.013
me doing
any illegal hacking?

14:03.013 --> 14:05.345
It's my GPA, Oliver.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.597
You're being ridiculous.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.229
No.

14:09.229 --> 14:10.891
You know what's ridiculous
is you not looking at your texts

14:10.891 --> 14:12.142
in front of me.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.273
Why?

14:13.273 --> 14:15.355
Is it Thomas?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.236
Nope.

14:16.236 --> 14:17.737
Let me guess --

14:17.737 --> 14:19.779
he's taking you to the Poconos
this weekend?
Connor.

14:19.779 --> 14:21.191
Oh, he could get you
one of those rooms

14:21.191 --> 14:22.282
with the champagne
glass tub --

14:22.282 --> 14:23.823
Booya!
You smell that, people?!

14:23.823 --> 14:26.246
That's the stank
of an automatic A-A-A-A!

14:26.246 --> 14:28.288
Yeah, Oli hacked
Produce Guy's e-mail.

14:28.288 --> 14:29.990
Guess what he sent someone
a link to

14:29.990 --> 14:32.162
just three weeks
before Edith was poisoned?

14:32.162 --> 14:33.293
It's an article about...

14:33.293 --> 14:34.414
Antifreeze.

14:34.414 --> 14:36.086
He e-mailed this article
to someone

14:36.086 --> 14:37.958
about three weeks
before your mother got sick.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.552
I told you
we could never do this.

14:42.552 --> 14:43.964
I know.
Guys...

14:43.964 --> 14:44.965
Seriously,
can I give you a hug?

14:44.965 --> 14:45.765
No.

14:45.765 --> 14:46.466
You can hug me.

14:46.466 --> 14:47.177
Guys!

14:48.638 --> 14:51.101
You can't show the prosecutor
that e-mail.

14:51.101 --> 14:53.273
This is our "Get Out of
Jail Free" card, literally.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.225
Why not, Karen?

14:55.225 --> 14:58.648
Roger sent
that e-mail to me.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.981
We've been seeing each other
for the past year.

15:00.981 --> 15:02.522
He knew about our texts,

15:02.522 --> 15:04.234
so he e-mailed me the article
as a joke.

15:04.234 --> 15:06.987
Always a freakin'
secret e-mail address.

15:06.987 --> 15:08.408
Or a secret boyfriend!

15:08.408 --> 15:10.290
I didn't want Mom
to sabotage it.

15:10.290 --> 15:11.371
Is that why you tried
to kill her, too?

15:11.371 --> 15:14.034
I didn't.
Please, I love my mother.

15:14.034 --> 15:15.835
I would never do anything
to hurt her.

15:15.835 --> 15:17.958
You need to drop her
and just represent us.

15:17.958 --> 15:18.628
Yeah.

15:18.628 --> 15:20.000
What?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.461
You and your boyfriend
are the only idiots

15:21.461 --> 15:22.882
they can connect this to.

15:22.882 --> 15:24.924
That's not true.
It's a conspiracy charge.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.097
All the texts
implicate all of you.

15:27.097 --> 15:28.718
So if there's proof
one of you did it,

15:28.718 --> 15:30.350
it proves
you all did it.

15:30.350 --> 15:32.512
You stupid bitch!
We're all gonna go down
because of you!

15:32.512 --> 15:34.014
Hey, maybe one of you did this
to set me up!

15:34.014 --> 15:35.935
Hey!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.267
Your depositions
are tomorrow,

15:37.267 --> 15:38.898
so you all have to stick
to the story

15:38.898 --> 15:40.650
that we've prepared.

15:40.650 --> 15:42.112
Can you do that?

15:42.112 --> 15:44.484
Or should we just send you all
to jail right now?

15:58.578 --> 15:59.789
Whoa.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.212
Slow down.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.004
What are you
doing here?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.256
Nothing, just got a meeting
with the D.A.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.887
Oh.

16:07.887 --> 16:10.800
I haven't seen you
around the house much.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.682
No.

16:12.682 --> 16:14.144
Oh.

16:14.144 --> 16:16.356
Well, it was, uh...
it was good to see you.

16:16.356 --> 16:18.808
Hey.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.190
How'd it go with NYPD?

16:21.861 --> 16:23.603
They came to the station
looking for you.

16:23.603 --> 16:24.944
I overheard your name.

16:24.944 --> 16:25.865
It's fine.

16:25.865 --> 16:27.157
My, uh...

16:27.157 --> 16:28.948
My lawyer took care
of it.

16:28.948 --> 16:30.030
Annalise?

16:30.030 --> 16:31.911
No, this guy
she recommended.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.288
Just watch your ass.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.879
I'm good.

16:39.879 --> 16:41.581
Good.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.390
"Let's make a skin suit
out of her

16:50.390 --> 16:52.392
and wear it
to the funeral."

16:52.392 --> 16:54.724
Mr. Duvall, you wrote that text
to your brother and sister

16:54.724 --> 16:56.636
just two weeks
before your mother took ill,

16:56.636 --> 16:57.347
is that correct?

16:57.347 --> 16:58.598
I was just venting.

17:06.486 --> 17:10.360
A dark sense of humor can get
anyone through hard times.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.741
Are you speaking
of the hard times

17:11.741 --> 17:13.703
you experienced due to working
with your mother?

17:13.703 --> 17:17.497
Anyone who works with family
knows it's not easy.

17:17.497 --> 17:19.499
And how would you describe
your relationship

17:19.499 --> 17:21.211
with your mother
outside of work?

17:21.211 --> 17:23.663
I'd say just like any other
mother/daughter relationship.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.085
Because it was
so contentious?

17:29.219 --> 17:30.970
No.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.382
Even when we disagreed,

17:32.382 --> 17:35.095
there was always love
between us.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.676
Jared,
a co-worker of yours

17:36.676 --> 17:38.888
stated that your mother
humiliated you

17:38.888 --> 17:40.980
in front of a woman
you were dating.

17:40.980 --> 17:42.021
Do you recall this event?

17:42.021 --> 17:43.853
I do not.

17:43.853 --> 17:45.145
Let me remind you.

17:45.145 --> 17:47.487
"Edith then proceeded
to tell a story

17:47.487 --> 17:50.900
about how Jared once reached
under his mother's dress

17:50.900 --> 17:53.243
at his birthday party
when he was 13."

17:53.243 --> 17:55.695
He was 14 and old enough
to know better.

17:55.695 --> 17:57.827
Strike Mrs. Duvall's
last statement from the record

17:57.827 --> 17:59.539
and remind her
she's not allowed to speak.

17:59.539 --> 18:00.750
I apologize.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.124
You must have been angry
with your mother

18:04.124 --> 18:06.126
for emasculating you
like that,

18:06.126 --> 18:07.377
especially in front
of a woman

18:07.377 --> 18:08.588
who you'd hoped
to be intimate with.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.970
She was never
gonna screw him.

18:10.970 --> 18:13.012
My client needs a break.

18:13.012 --> 18:15.555
He's a virgin,
probably will be till he dies.

18:15.555 --> 18:18.308
And you wonder
why people want you dead?!
Jared.

18:18.308 --> 18:21.100
What kind of monster gets off
on mocking her own son?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.982
One of needs to get off.

18:22.982 --> 18:25.525
I look forward
to the day you die.

18:30.530 --> 18:32.492
We say the depo was mandated
under false pretenses.

18:32.492 --> 18:34.654
That way the footage
can never be shown in court.

18:34.654 --> 18:36.696
And if we lose that motion,
the explosion gets played

18:36.696 --> 18:38.788
for the entire jury
at trial.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.370
We argue that Jared
had a mental break,

18:40.370 --> 18:41.241
which made him
legally incompetent

18:41.241 --> 18:42.292
to testify as a witness.

18:42.292 --> 18:43.793
A mental illness
diagnosis

18:43.793 --> 18:46.376
only makes him look more capable
of offing his mother.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.508
So we just wait to get our asses
kicked in trail?

18:48.508 --> 18:50.630
Well, unless you can pull
a rabbit out of your ass,

18:50.630 --> 18:51.881
that's exactly
what I'm saying.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.343
I still get an "A"

18:53.343 --> 18:54.804
for finding that
secret e-mail though, right?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.136
Professor Keating?

18:59.519 --> 19:00.970
Have you heard
from Meggy?

19:00.970 --> 19:03.393
Stop.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.565
This would be easier
if I didn't actually like her.

19:05.565 --> 19:06.396
Laurel.

19:10.109 --> 19:11.771
I'm scared, Wes.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.325
I don't want to wake up
and realize

19:15.325 --> 19:17.116
none of this was real.

19:17.116 --> 19:18.448
It's real for me.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.701
♪ Slow me down ♪

19:21.701 --> 19:22.702

19:29.709 --> 19:33.002

for a minute? ♪

19:34.714 --> 19:37.056

answered that question for me,

19:37.056 --> 19:38.218
and Annalise destroyed you.

19:40.890 --> 19:43.803
You never said anything.

19:43.803 --> 19:45.855
I thought you were
out of my league.

19:45.855 --> 19:48.268
♪ Play me like I'm someone
who's better-looking ♪

19:48.268 --> 19:50.019
Same.

19:50.019 --> 19:50.980
Come on.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.362
What?

19:55.775 --> 19:58.368
♪ I play it off
like I'm a winner ♪

19:58.368 --> 20:00.620
Seriously, though.

20:00.620 --> 20:04.874
I thought I'd
never stand a chance.

20:04.874 --> 20:06.456
Look at you now.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.877
Huh?

20:07.877 --> 20:10.039
♪ I'm turning puddles
into oceans ♪

20:10.039 --> 20:12.832
♪ I'll tell you

20:14.754 --> 20:16.636

20:18.097 --> 20:20.640
Connor.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.011
Hey, what is it?

20:22.011 --> 20:23.603
What it always is.

20:23.603 --> 20:25.975
You being my personal
herpes sore that won't go away.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.437
Okay,
I'm just gonna hang up.

20:27.437 --> 20:29.439
Charles Mahoney
has an alibi.

20:29.439 --> 20:31.271
My team was able
to uncover evidence

20:31.271 --> 20:33.313
concretely placing Charles
at a location

20:33.313 --> 20:35.735
far from the scene
of his father's shooting.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.947
Once the D.A.'s office
reviews this evidence,

20:37.947 --> 20:39.819
I'm confident that these
unwarranted, ludicrous charges

20:39.819 --> 20:41.491
will be dropped,

20:41.491 --> 20:42.862
and my client will be able
to get back to running

20:42.862 --> 20:44.364
the company his father built
from the ground up...

20:44.364 --> 20:45.915
You told me Eve said the police
were only interested --

20:45.915 --> 20:47.457
...and the
New York Police Department...
That was a lie.

20:47.457 --> 20:48.828
...will finally find the actual
suspect who did this.

20:48.828 --> 20:51.040
Eve moved to San Francisco. I
haven't spoken to her in weeks.

20:52.872 --> 20:55.465
So we're not safe?

20:56.336 --> 20:58.047
Who knows?

20:58.047 --> 20:59.469
-Just talk to us.
-What are we supposed to do?

20:59.469 --> 21:00.470
-Where are you going?
-Don't walk away.

21:00.470 --> 21:03.142
I don't know what to do!

21:07.016 --> 21:08.808
That's the truth.

21:08.808 --> 21:11.481
Sometimes I lie to protect you,
to keep you from worrying,

21:11.481 --> 21:14.063
because I know
it can drive a person insane.

21:14.063 --> 21:16.486
No, it's the lies
that drive us insane.

21:16.486 --> 21:17.777
Seriously, you ask us
to trust you,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.108
and you keep hiding stuff
from us.

21:19.108 --> 21:20.400
She's doing the best
she can.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.572
But we're not asking her
to be perfect.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.074
Okay, we're just asking her
to be honest.

21:25.074 --> 21:26.536
Or are you not capable
of that?

21:26.536 --> 21:28.117
Otherwise,
we might find out

21:28.117 --> 21:30.039
that you're not as smart
as we think you are.

21:46.806 --> 21:50.520
So, you have things to get off
your chest -- let's do this.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.732
I don't want to end up
poisoned.

21:52.732 --> 21:57.106
So you tell me all the ways
you think I've ruined your life.

21:58.898 --> 22:00.069
Come at me.

22:03.703 --> 22:05.905
I said, come at me!

22:14.794 --> 22:16.756
And then you
pimped me out to Caleb
like I was some kind of hooker.

22:16.756 --> 22:17.957
You knew I was vulnerable
after Aiden,

22:17.957 --> 22:20.800
so you sent me
into that psychopath's arms.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.961
I never told you
to screw that boy.

22:21.961 --> 22:23.593
But you wanted me to.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.054
In what world do you think
I have time to think about

22:25.054 --> 22:26.305
who you pull down
your skirt for?

22:26.305 --> 22:28.097
You're not allowed
to talk right now!

22:28.097 --> 22:29.639
This is our time --
you said that.

22:29.639 --> 22:30.640
So sit there and take it.

22:34.143 --> 22:35.645
None of this would have happened
if you just let us go

22:35.645 --> 22:37.647
to the police after Sam.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.859
But, you know, instead, you --

22:39.859 --> 22:42.281
you started this
insane game of chess

22:42.281 --> 22:43.983
of -- of running around
and lying...

22:43.983 --> 22:48.197
I thought you were this
amazing, powerful woman,

22:48.197 --> 22:50.289
but look at your life.

22:50.289 --> 22:51.621
You have no one.

22:51.621 --> 22:52.832
I do whatever you say --

22:52.832 --> 22:55.044
that's what
our relationship is --

22:55.044 --> 22:57.837
you controlling me
and me following your orders

22:57.837 --> 23:00.379
like some...puppet.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.552
I thought my father
was a bully,

23:02.552 --> 23:05.304
but you take it
to a whole nother level.

23:05.304 --> 23:07.427
And now we're --
we're all basket cases.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.138
But, you know,
maybe you like that.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.470
I mean, you don't respect
any of us.

23:10.470 --> 23:11.601
But the worst part is

23:11.601 --> 23:13.773
that I don't think
you respect yourself.

23:13.773 --> 23:16.686
And it makes me feel sick
that some part of me

23:16.686 --> 23:18.858
still just wants
to please you.

23:18.858 --> 23:19.779
Cold, two-faced...

23:19.779 --> 23:20.900
Mean alcoholic...

23:20.900 --> 23:22.151
I don't want to hate you...

23:22.151 --> 23:23.402
...angry in this way that
I didn't know was possible...

23:23.402 --> 23:24.904
It just makes me
feel alone...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.115
You're not happy.

23:26.115 --> 23:27.527
...and scared...
We're not happy.

23:27.527 --> 23:28.868
...to the point that
I wake up every morning

23:28.868 --> 23:30.119
and I think, "Maybe
we should just go to jail."

23:30.119 --> 23:31.410
None of us are happy.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.912
...and it's making me
act insane.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.163
-Phony.
-Confused.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.795
-Miserable.
-Pathetic.

23:35.795 --> 23:37.036
-Pissed off.
-Sad.

23:37.036 --> 23:37.997
-Hopeless.
-Toxic.

23:37.997 --> 23:39.168
-Insane.
-Exhausted.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.460
-Two-sided.
-Broken.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.381
Tired.

23:49.218 --> 23:50.930
Go ahead.

23:52.221 --> 23:53.853
No.

23:53.853 --> 23:55.855
I can take it, Wes.

23:55.855 --> 23:58.317
It's not that.

23:58.317 --> 24:01.691
You already know
how I feel about you.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.866
It's not
how your body looks --

24:46.866 --> 24:48.367
it's how you use it.

24:53.322 --> 24:54.874
Okay.

All right,

I'm staying.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.841

is that you just got to be you.

25:19.729 --> 25:21.440
You got this, Hampton.

25:23.903 --> 25:26.566
I, uh, hope you don't mind
I went into your drawer.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.908
Just figured we could
probably use these.

25:28.908 --> 25:30.860
Yeah, that, um...
that depends.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.241
Oh, I see.

25:32.241 --> 25:34.203
Now you're gonna play
hard to get.

25:38.457 --> 25:40.249
Mm.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.664
Thomas.

25:44.664 --> 25:46.505
I'm listening.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.840
I'm poz.

25:52.882 --> 25:55.224
Like, undetectable.

25:55.224 --> 25:57.056
I-I went to the doctor
a week ago,

25:57.056 --> 25:58.848
which means,
if we use a condom,

25:58.848 --> 26:01.230
it's actually safer
to have sex with me

26:01.230 --> 26:03.102
than it is with someone
who says he's negative

26:03.102 --> 26:05.735
but then, like,
hasn't been tested recently.

26:05.735 --> 26:08.447
I'm just telling you
all of this because, uh,

26:08.447 --> 26:12.992
you're naked,
which is awesome.

26:12.992 --> 26:15.785
Like, wow.

26:15.785 --> 26:18.497
Uh, are you mad?

26:18.497 --> 26:21.080
No, no, God, no.
Of course not.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.003
Uh, I was just really starting
to like you.

26:26.916 --> 26:28.377
Is that
such a bad thing?

26:28.377 --> 26:30.339
Oh, my God, no.
I'm -- I'm sorry.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.510
This is...

26:31.510 --> 26:32.922
This is coming out
all wrong.

26:32.922 --> 26:34.343
Is it?
Yes.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.135
'Cause I don't need you
to mince words.

26:36.135 --> 26:37.386
This is just new to me.

26:37.386 --> 26:39.809
Yeah, it's new to me, too.

26:39.809 --> 26:41.891
And you understand.
I mean, it's just...

26:43.683 --> 26:46.145
I don't know.
It's a -- It's a lot to process.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.362
Oliver, honestly, I...

26:55.574 --> 26:58.407
I don't know if I'm ready
to deal with all this.

27:04.243 --> 27:06.005
Finally, they tested my blood

27:06.005 --> 27:10.589
and realized I had been
poisoned with antifreeze.

27:10.589 --> 27:13.092
At this point,
it's not a matter of if,

27:13.092 --> 27:16.425
but when it takes my life.

27:16.425 --> 27:17.887
What would like to say...

27:17.887 --> 27:19.428
I thought
you might be hungry.

27:19.428 --> 27:20.469
Does it have rum in it?

27:22.722 --> 27:24.974
A few more weeks
of no drinking

27:24.974 --> 27:28.938
and they can add fat-ass
to their list of insults.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.529
They're just scared.

27:30.529 --> 27:34.363
Was there a history
of hostility?

27:34.363 --> 27:36.325
The business
put a roof over our heads,

27:36.325 --> 27:37.697
but family was everything.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.488
Help me salvage this case.

27:39.488 --> 27:41.450
Who would believe
that my children

27:41.450 --> 27:43.783
would do this thing?

27:43.783 --> 27:45.995
I sacrificed so much
for them.

27:45.995 --> 27:47.456
And police
brought charges

27:47.456 --> 27:49.248
against all three
of your children, correct?

27:49.248 --> 27:51.670
How about
using this interview?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.843
You could say
it biased the jury pool,

27:53.843 --> 27:57.386
making a fair trail
impossible.

27:57.386 --> 27:59.428
You could motion
for a bench trial.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.680
Why do you think your children
would do this to you...
Or if we do have a jury trial

28:01.680 --> 28:02.722
...seeking destruction?
we can seek an instruction...

28:02.722 --> 28:04.353
I don't know.

28:04.353 --> 28:05.895
I've done nothing but love them
and gave them everything.

28:05.895 --> 28:07.356
...limiting the depositions
to impeachment evidence

28:07.356 --> 28:08.808
if our clients
have to take the stand.

28:08.808 --> 28:10.770
Because that's
what a mother does.

28:12.151 --> 28:13.112
You're also the boss,
correct?
Bonnie.

28:13.112 --> 28:14.653
What?

28:14.653 --> 28:16.025
You're the owner and manager
of Duvall's Kitchen.

28:16.025 --> 28:17.616
Edith poisoned herself.

28:17.616 --> 28:18.818
That's insane.

28:18.818 --> 28:20.780
She must've known
about Karen's secret e-mails

28:20.780 --> 28:21.821
and did it to herself.

28:21.821 --> 28:23.082
You have no proof.

28:23.082 --> 28:25.244
Let's just say
I can understand why a mother

28:25.244 --> 28:27.036
would want to punish
her ungrateful children.

28:29.999 --> 28:34.593
Okay, uh, so, you confront her
during her deposition?

28:34.593 --> 28:35.835
No.

28:35.835 --> 28:37.426
You confront her
during her deposition.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.931
What -- you don't want
the automatic "A"?

28:41.931 --> 28:43.642
Uh, yeah, no,
of course I do.

28:43.642 --> 28:45.394
I just, uh...

28:45.394 --> 28:46.265
why me?

28:46.265 --> 28:48.397
Because you're my puppet.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.984
Mrs. Duvall,
during his deposition yesterday,

28:54.984 --> 28:57.696
your oldest son, Jared,
testified that --

28:57.696 --> 29:00.619
My oldest is Nelson.

29:00.619 --> 29:01.991
Oh, sorry.

29:01.991 --> 29:06.826
Um, your --
Nelson testified that, uh,

29:06.826 --> 29:09.538
you depended on him
for everything.

29:09.538 --> 29:11.921
Is that what he said?

29:11.921 --> 29:14.043
Uh...I belive so.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.464
Is that not true?

29:15.464 --> 29:18.467
I relied on my son
for things any mother would.

29:18.467 --> 29:21.550
I just never thought
he'd try to murder me for that.

29:21.550 --> 29:23.342
All right.

29:23.342 --> 29:26.806
Hang on.
My, uh, cards got mixed up.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.057
She's a disaster.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.728
Ms. Keating, perhaps
you should take over

29:29.728 --> 29:31.650
so our witness isn't forced
to be up here for too long.

29:31.650 --> 29:33.062
This is a teaching clinic.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.814
Just let us know
if you need a break.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.315
Oh, no.

29:36.315 --> 29:38.487
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

29:38.487 --> 29:40.069
Here!

29:40.069 --> 29:43.612
Would you say you're involved
in your children's love lives?

29:43.612 --> 29:46.165
There isn't much to be involved
in  sadly.

29:46.165 --> 29:47.166
Really?

29:47.166 --> 29:50.619
They're all single,
unhappily so.

29:50.619 --> 29:54.373
Oh, because I believe
Karen mentioned she was involved

29:54.373 --> 29:57.416
with a man
who delivered your produce.

29:57.416 --> 29:59.879
Oh, Roger Colby
used her for sex.

29:59.879 --> 30:02.131
That's not
a real relationship.

30:02.131 --> 30:03.182
Um...

30:05.634 --> 30:08.637
Mrs. Duvall, Karen kept
her relationship with Roger

30:08.637 --> 30:09.929
a secret.

30:12.061 --> 30:15.434
So how'd you find out
about it?

30:15.434 --> 30:16.936
Call it
mother's intuition.

30:16.936 --> 30:19.358
Or did you find out by snooping
into her secret e-mail?

30:19.358 --> 30:20.609
Excuse me.
Ms. Keating --

30:20.609 --> 30:21.820
You require your employees

30:21.820 --> 30:23.572
to lock their cellphones
in your desk

30:23.572 --> 30:25.034
while they're working,
correct?

30:25.034 --> 30:25.824
You don't have
to answer that.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.156
It's company policy.

30:27.156 --> 30:28.827
A policy that allowed you
to read Karen's e-mail

30:28.827 --> 30:30.249
about poisoning you,

30:30.249 --> 30:32.001
which is why you decided
to poison yourself.

30:32.001 --> 30:33.042
That's how angry you were
at them.

30:33.042 --> 30:34.373
I call for a break.

30:34.373 --> 30:36.125
I will not be accused
of lies in this room.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.167
Then admit what you did.
Mrs. Duvall --

30:38.167 --> 30:40.669
Is this what you wanted --
to tell everyone how you feel?

30:40.669 --> 30:42.631
You gave your children
your life,

30:42.631 --> 30:45.674
and they paid you back
by fantasizing about your death.

30:45.674 --> 30:47.346
It devastated you...

30:47.346 --> 30:49.058
to the point where that you
risked your life

30:49.058 --> 30:51.060
to teach them a lesson.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.063
Mrs. Duvall, you have the right
to seek advice of counsel.

30:56.815 --> 31:01.690
Children always take their
mothers for granted.

31:01.690 --> 31:04.283
Maybe now mine won't.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.158
Nothing further.

31:20.049 --> 31:21.300
The automatic "A"
is yours, Ms. Castillo.

31:21.300 --> 31:24.053
The rest of you,
I suggest you start studying.

31:24.053 --> 31:26.595
I'm in the mood
to give some F's.

31:26.595 --> 31:28.597
Oh, she handed you that win.
Don't look so cocky.

31:28.597 --> 31:30.099
Mm!

31:30.099 --> 31:31.770
I'll trade you my outlines
for the rest of the year.

31:31.770 --> 31:34.723
Never, but drinks on me,
everyone,

31:34.723 --> 31:36.225
at Liberty Hill.

31:36.225 --> 31:38.517
Hey, want to walk over
to the bar...together?

31:38.517 --> 31:40.519
Uh, you know,
I should go study.

31:40.519 --> 31:43.732
Wow, look at you, taking
your schoolwork all seriously.

31:43.732 --> 31:45.154
Yeah, you know,
fake it till you make it.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.115
Right.

31:47.866 --> 31:49.788
Hey,
are -- are you okay?

31:49.788 --> 31:50.829
Yeah.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.040
President Hargrove.

32:08.547 --> 32:11.720
Hi.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.012
Give me your phone.

32:13.012 --> 32:14.353
I'm sorry?

32:14.353 --> 32:17.146
I know the best family attorney
in the city.

32:17.146 --> 32:19.148
Oh, no need.

32:19.148 --> 32:22.151
Raul and I are trying
to work things out.

32:22.151 --> 32:25.154
And you know he's not going
to change his mind?

32:33.072 --> 32:36.665
Her name is Nina Horton.
She's great.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.841
Thanks.

32:42.841 --> 32:44.923
Any time.

33:08.407 --> 33:12.031
You finally want your shot
to come at me, too?

33:12.031 --> 33:15.074
I ran in to Nate
at the courthouse.

33:15.074 --> 33:17.456
Did he say something
to you?

33:17.456 --> 33:19.878
He told me to be careful.

33:19.878 --> 33:21.080
Of me?

33:30.799 --> 33:33.052
I'm sorry
I lied to the police.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.223
It's fine.

33:34.223 --> 33:36.435
Not if Charles has an alibi.

33:36.435 --> 33:37.936
You'll just have say
that you saw

33:37.936 --> 33:40.769
someone
who looked like him.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.402
And then what?

33:43.402 --> 33:45.194
We wait till the next
terrible thing happens?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.953
I wanted to tell Nate
it's you

33:54.953 --> 33:56.205
who should be protected
from me.

33:56.205 --> 33:57.916
Ah, stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

33:57.916 --> 33:59.578
I'm just saying
what everyone thinks.

33:59.578 --> 34:01.039
They're wrong.

34:01.039 --> 34:05.334
You don't have the luxury
to feel guilty right now.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.795
It's not fair
to your mother.

34:10.379 --> 34:14.433
She sacrificed for you
to have a good life.

34:14.433 --> 34:16.725
So that's your job
to live as good as you can.

34:21.140 --> 34:23.852
We both owe her that.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.753
Hey.

34:54.883 --> 34:56.805
Hey.

34:56.805 --> 34:59.388
You're drunk.

34:59.388 --> 35:00.269
Yep.

35:00.269 --> 35:01.980
Can I drink that water?

35:08.106 --> 35:10.859
Did something happen
with Thomas?

35:13.071 --> 35:16.114
Yeah, Thomas isn't ready
to date a poz guy.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.618
Yeah, I'm sorry.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.789
It's fine.

35:20.789 --> 35:22.080
It's not.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.547
I want to say something,

35:28.547 --> 35:31.630
but I'm not sure
if it's just me being selfish.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.923
Say it.

35:34.923 --> 35:36.755
I miss you,

35:36.755 --> 35:39.388
and I-I know
I shouldn't tell you that

35:39.388 --> 35:41.430
'cause I-I broke up
with you.

35:41.430 --> 35:44.683
And I-I hurt you,

35:44.683 --> 35:47.816
and I see that
every single day.

35:47.816 --> 35:50.439
So for me to come here

35:50.439 --> 35:52.651
just because I'm,
like, sad and depressed,

35:52.651 --> 35:55.534
that's...not fair.

35:58.277 --> 36:02.451
You can always come to me.
You know that.

36:02.451 --> 36:04.162
Isn't that just selfish,
though?

36:06.415 --> 36:07.916
No.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.839
'Cause I miss you, too.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.023
Ah...
She won't notice.

36:35.023 --> 36:36.365
It's Michaela.
Of course she will.

36:36.365 --> 36:37.276
Whatever.

36:39.738 --> 36:41.620
You were right...

36:44.953 --> 36:48.206
...that I need to go to her,
tell her everything.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.129
I just felt like I needed
to do something

36:51.129 --> 36:54.132
that proves
she can still trust me.

37:00.929 --> 37:02.761
I'm so sorry
I left you.

37:05.053 --> 37:07.185
Was Laurel not home?

37:09.728 --> 37:11.900
She must've been
your first stop.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.653
I'm just your...

37:14.653 --> 37:16.615
sloppy seconds.

37:16.615 --> 37:17.776
You're mad.

37:17.776 --> 37:19.658
I understand that.

37:19.658 --> 37:21.780
I'm not mad.

37:21.780 --> 37:24.032
I'm just bored.

37:24.032 --> 37:25.784
I needed to go fix things
on my own.

37:25.784 --> 37:28.417
Then tell me that

37:28.417 --> 37:30.959
instead of abandoning me
in some motel room.

37:30.959 --> 37:32.461
I was afraid
you'd stop me.

37:32.461 --> 37:34.212
I don't believe you!

37:36.295 --> 37:40.799
I lied to Annalise
to help you,

37:40.799 --> 37:43.592
risked everything.

37:43.592 --> 37:47.686
And you just
threw it back in my face.

37:47.686 --> 37:49.017
You used me.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.309
No.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.312
That meant something to me.

37:53.312 --> 37:56.395
I can't believe
anything you say anymore.

37:56.395 --> 37:59.197
I screwed up,
a-and I hate myself for that.

37:59.197 --> 38:00.198
You should.

38:00.198 --> 38:01.900
But I need you
so bad right now.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.032
You killed us the minute
you left me in that room.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.203
This isn't you talking.

38:05.203 --> 38:07.706
This is the most honest
I've ever been with you.

38:07.706 --> 38:09.668
It's Annalise.
She's in your head.

38:09.668 --> 38:12.210
Annalise was the only one of us
who was right about you.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.586
Sam just fell for your act,
and so did I,

38:17.586 --> 38:21.920
and that was the worst mistake
any of us ever made.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.592
Please don't do this.

38:23.592 --> 38:24.803
Get out.

38:24.803 --> 38:25.804
I'll do anything.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.015
I said, get out.

38:28.767 --> 38:31.189
Get out!

38:31.189 --> 38:33.311
Get out!

38:33.311 --> 38:34.523
Get out!

39:10.559 --> 39:12.851
Oh, I hope to God
Connor's not here.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.352
I want to make noise.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.684
Mm.

39:20.529 --> 39:21.690
Hey.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.692
Wait. You two
are friends again?

39:23.692 --> 39:25.323
We've always been
friends.

39:25.323 --> 39:28.326
Yay to my bro-mos!

39:32.290 --> 39:34.162
Asher.

39:34.162 --> 39:36.374
Ah, sorry, gentlemen.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.587
Duty calls.

39:40.759 --> 39:44.593
Connor, why
is my duvet upside-down?!

39:44.593 --> 39:45.844
I'd probably be drunk, too,

39:45.844 --> 39:47.426
if I already had an "A"
on a midterm.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.807
I'm not drunk.

39:48.807 --> 39:50.809
I'm tipsy,

39:50.809 --> 39:53.562
and I'll give you my "A"
if you want it.

39:53.562 --> 39:55.313
I know how hard tests are
for you.

39:56.565 --> 39:57.816
Ow! Ohh.

39:57.816 --> 39:59.067
Okay, you should probably
go to bed

39:59.067 --> 40:00.018
before you hurt yourself.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.112
I'll see you
in class tomorrow, okay?

40:04.112 --> 40:05.363
Fine.

40:05.363 --> 40:06.445
Good night.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.946
Good night.
Love you.

40:16.164 --> 40:16.915
Really?

40:37.516 --> 40:40.769
Page Dr. Lowell!

40:40.769 --> 40:41.770
It's Meggy.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.401
It's Meggy, Laurel.
You're okay.

40:43.401 --> 40:46.114
You have a tube in your throat,
and it's helping you breathe.

40:46.114 --> 40:47.656
So I just need you stay calm.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.568
The doctor's on her way, okay?
It's gonna be all right.

40:51.990 --> 40:54.452
It's okay.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.664
What? What? What?
What is it?

40:56.454 --> 40:59.167
What?

40:59.167 --> 41:00.418
Pen? This?

41:01.630 --> 41:03.341
Okay, okay.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.175
Here, here.

41:07.175 --> 41:09.427
Here. Right here.

41:13.261 --> 41:15.894
Oliver and I have been trying
to calling him, okay?

41:15.894 --> 41:17.976
It's late,
and he's probably sleeping.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.188
As soon as he calls,
I will let you know.

41:20.188 --> 41:22.060
I promise.

41:25.023 --> 41:26.484
Well, here it is.

41:31.530 --> 41:32.571
Immunity.

41:37.706 --> 41:38.877
The evidence?

41:38.877 --> 41:40.168
Anonymous source.

41:40.168 --> 41:42.420
Provided information
that ties you to the charges.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.504
Pen?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.756
You sure you don't want
an attorney present?

41:47.756 --> 41:48.757
Yeah.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.008
Your pen.

41:56.134 --> 41:59.517
This is wrong,
as is this.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.639
You said this would cover

42:00.639 --> 42:02.350
obstruction of justice
and conspiracy,

42:02.350 --> 42:03.812
so I want that
in writing, too.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.403
That's blanket immunity.

42:05.403 --> 42:07.105
You want someone
to help take her down?

42:08.987 --> 42:10.989
This is the only way I talk.
