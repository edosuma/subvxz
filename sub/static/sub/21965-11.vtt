00:03.041 --> 00:05.125
Doc, I hope you get this.

00:05.166 --> 00:07.834
Remember how my Uncle Woodrow

00:05.166 --> 00:07.834
wanted to search for aliens

00:07.875 --> 00:10.250
at the center of the Earth?

00:07.875 --> 00:10.250
Well...

00:10.291 --> 00:12.125
CODY:

00:10.291 --> 00:12.125
Things didn't exactly

00:10.291 --> 00:12.125
go as planned.

00:12.166 --> 00:14.500
We got trapped underground.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.917
And when my family, the Bots,

00:14.542 --> 00:16.917
and even Optimus Prime

00:16.959 --> 00:18.208
came to rescue us...

00:20.000 --> 00:23.417
The cavern collapsed,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.417
and everyone got separated.

00:23.458 --> 00:26.458
( both grunting )

00:26.500 --> 00:29.750
Now Dad, Uncle Woodrow, Chase,

00:26.500 --> 00:29.750
and I are stuck down here

00:29.792 --> 00:31.542
and separated from the others.

00:31.583 --> 00:35.041
If you get this message, Doc,

00:31.583 --> 00:35.041
please send help. Fast!

00:37.834 --> 00:39.208
Aw, come on.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.458
I set your GPS coordinates

00:39.250 --> 00:41.458
for Doc Greene's lab,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.333
now get going!

00:43.375 --> 00:47.000
Sorry, Son. It was a good idea,

00:43.375 --> 00:47.000
but satellite tech won't work

00:47.041 --> 00:50.125
this deep underground.

00:47.041 --> 00:50.125
Comlinks either.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.834
Well, we'll just have to find

00:50.166 --> 00:52.834
the rest of the family

00:52.875 --> 00:56.625
using only our wits and courage.

00:52.875 --> 00:56.625
It's an adventure!

00:56.667 --> 00:59.500
It's irresponsible.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.500
Which is why I was against

00:59.542 --> 01:01.917
this subterranean joyride

00:59.542 --> 01:01.917
to begin with.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.583
You know, Charlie,

01:01.959 --> 01:04.583
you'll never learn anything

01:04.625 --> 01:07.083
if you don't leave the island

01:04.625 --> 01:07.083
once in awhile.

01:07.125 --> 01:10.083
I don't need to get burned

01:07.125 --> 01:10.083
to know that fire is hot.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.417
Speaking of which, sir,

01:10.125 --> 01:12.417
I seem to have--

01:12.458 --> 01:14.917
--But apparently I need to

01:17.041 --> 01:21.166
Ahem. Chief? I am sorry to say--

01:17.041 --> 01:21.166
Discover? I told you!

01:21.208 --> 01:23.250
Yeah, took you

01:21.208 --> 01:23.250
long enough.

Actually,

I believe it is lava.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.709
A pterodactyl!

07:37.375 --> 07:40.709
Amazing!

07:40.750 --> 07:42.750
( pterodactyl squawking )

07:44.000 --> 07:45.792
Um...

07:44.000 --> 07:45.792
Fascinating.

07:45.834 --> 07:50.250
Great. So I guess Boulder's

07:45.834 --> 07:50.250
sonar doesn't detect dinosaurs.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.875
Technically,

07:50.291 --> 07:52.875
that's a flying lizard.

07:52.917 --> 07:55.000
Technically,

07:52.917 --> 07:55.000
we're lunch.

07:55.041 --> 07:59.166
It hasn't seen us yet.

07:55.041 --> 07:59.166
Blades, let's do some recon.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.458
I think I see

07:59.208 --> 08:01.458
another tunnel across the water.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.041
Um, you want me

08:01.500 --> 08:04.041
to get in the air

08:04.083 --> 08:06.250
when there's

08:04.083 --> 08:06.250
a terror-doctor up there?

08:06.291 --> 08:09.750
Pterodactyl.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.750
And we'll fly low.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

08:24.125 --> 08:25.500
Almost there, Blades.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.125
I have to admit,

08:27.166 --> 08:30.125
it does feel nice

08:27.166 --> 08:30.125
to stretch my rotors. Whoa!

08:30.166 --> 08:32.458
Blades!

08:30.166 --> 08:32.458
Get higher, now!

08:36.083 --> 08:38.959
( both scream )

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Dani!

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Blades!

08:43.291 --> 08:45.041
( Dani & Blades yelling )

08:45.083 --> 08:46.750
Blades! Try Bot mode!

08:48.667 --> 08:52.000
( grunting )

08:52.041 --> 08:54.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:00.250 --> 09:02.250
( giant fish groaning )

09:07.333 --> 09:10.041
Yes! Yeah, come on over here!

09:07.333 --> 09:10.041
You made it!

09:12.625 --> 09:15.375
(  triumphant theme playing  )

09:15.417 --> 09:17.458
Dani! Are you okay?

09:15.417 --> 09:17.458
We thought...

09:17.500 --> 09:19.625
( sighs )

09:19.667 --> 09:23.458
Remind me to give this "seaside

09:19.667 --> 09:23.458
vacation spot" a bad review.

09:23.500 --> 09:28.000
Unh!

09:23.500 --> 09:28.000
Negative five stars.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.166
We need to find

09:28.041 --> 09:30.166
a safer cavern.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.625
( sonar beeps )

09:32.667 --> 09:34.667
KADE:

09:32.667 --> 09:34.667
No, whoa, wait!

09:34.709 --> 09:36.875
How do you know they're not

09:34.709 --> 09:36.875
even bigger dinosaurs

09:36.917 --> 09:38.834
looking for a fight

09:36.917 --> 09:38.834
on the other side of that wall?

09:38.875 --> 09:41.291
Just--Just turn off

09:38.875 --> 09:41.291
your sonic-doohickey

09:41.333 --> 09:42.834
unless you can use it

09:41.333 --> 09:42.834
to find Dad.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.125
Maybe we can.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.125
If I adjust my sound waves

09:47.166 --> 09:49.083
to compensate

09:47.166 --> 09:49.083
for the rock's frangibility...

09:49.125 --> 09:52.041
And we use the natural cavern

09:49.125 --> 09:52.041
acoustics to boost amplitude...

09:52.083 --> 09:54.917
Is that what it sounds like

09:52.083 --> 09:54.917
to everyone else when we talk?

09:54.959 --> 09:57.583
Yeah, with more

09:54.959 --> 09:57.583
pop culture references.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:59.458 --> 10:02.125
WOODROW:

09:59.458 --> 10:02.125
So you aliens don't sleep...

10:02.166 --> 10:03.458
Now, do you eat?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.875
Uh, not as humans do.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.583
Well, that answers

10:05.917 --> 10:08.583
my next question.

10:08.625 --> 10:11.417
Hold up!

10:11.458 --> 10:14.375
I don't want us getting any more

10:11.458 --> 10:14.375
lost than we already are.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.834
Chase, you stay

10:14.417 --> 10:16.834
with Cody and Woodrow.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.375
I'll take a rope

10:16.875 --> 10:18.375
and scout ahead.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.583
I'll help.

10:21.625 --> 10:24.208
It'll go faster if we search

10:21.625 --> 10:24.208
two passages at once.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.542
No. I don't need you running off

10:24.250 --> 10:27.542
and playing explorer.

10:27.583 --> 10:31.625
( sighs ):

10:27.583 --> 10:31.625
Is this about the time

10:27.583 --> 10:31.625
you got lost in the forest?

10:31.667 --> 10:33.750
I was rescuing you.

10:33.792 --> 10:36.250
Who said I wanted

10:33.792 --> 10:36.250
to be rescued?

10:36.291 --> 10:38.917
You did! You called me

10:36.291 --> 10:38.917
on the walkie-talkie!

10:38.959 --> 10:40.291
Did not.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.291
Did too!

10:40.333 --> 10:41.583
Did not!

10:40.333 --> 10:41.583
Did too!

10:41.625 --> 10:43.583
You're crazy.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.583
I remember it...

10:43.625 --> 10:46.291
I am confused. I thought Chief

10:43.625 --> 10:46.291
had reconciled his differences

10:46.333 --> 10:48.125
with his brother.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.959
It's like me and Kade.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.959
We don't always agree,

10:51.000 --> 10:52.625
but blood is

10:51.000 --> 10:52.625
thicker than water.

10:52.667 --> 10:55.875
I was unaware that fluid

10:52.667 --> 10:55.875
viscosity was involved.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.083
It just means

10:55.917 --> 10:58.083
that deep down,

10:58.125 --> 11:00.041
brothers would do anything

10:58.125 --> 11:00.041
for each other.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.583
Perhaps you should

11:00.083 --> 11:02.583
remind them of that fact.

11:02.625 --> 11:06.250
And don't get me started about

11:02.625 --> 11:06.250
the time you stole my stopwatch.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.834
Borrowed!

11:06.291 --> 11:08.834
CODY: Hey! Burns family!

11:08.875 --> 11:11.667
You can argue once we're

11:08.875 --> 11:11.667
all safe above ground.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.959
But now we need

11:11.709 --> 11:13.959
to work together to get there.

11:15.709 --> 11:19.375
You're right, Son.

11:15.709 --> 11:19.375
Sorry we got so sidetracked.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.125
Pinky truce?

11:21.166 --> 11:23.291
( chuckles ):

11:21.166 --> 11:23.291
Pinky truce.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.917
I am happy to hear that

11:23.333 --> 11:25.917
your blood is thick, sir.

11:25.959 --> 11:27.959
( rumbling )

11:29.458 --> 11:31.667
Whoa!

11:29.458 --> 11:31.667
Is that an earthquake?

11:31.709 --> 11:35.083
It almost sounds like drumming.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.917
Morse code. Hurry,

11:35.125 --> 11:38.917
it's coming from over here.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:48.542 --> 11:50.542
It's your transport.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.917
OPTIMUS:

11:53.375 --> 11:55.917
Help me pull it free.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.458
( both grunting )

12:04.375 --> 12:07.000
What in the allspark?

12:09.417 --> 12:11.625
Energon.

12:11.667 --> 12:16.250
OPTIMUS:

12:11.667 --> 12:16.250
A deposit of Energon

12:11.667 --> 12:16.250
this rich is invaluable.

12:16.291 --> 12:18.291
I only wish

12:16.291 --> 12:18.291
we had found it

12:18.333 --> 12:20.375
under more positive

12:18.333 --> 12:20.375
circumstances.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.166
( loud thudding )

12:22.208 --> 12:24.375
That sounds like

12:22.208 --> 12:24.375
Boulder.

(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:33.041 --> 12:36.166
Dad!

12:33.041 --> 12:36.166
We're coming down!

12:36.208 --> 12:37.917
Woodrow! Be careful!

12:37.959 --> 12:39.834
That rock doesn't look

12:37.959 --> 12:39.834
very strong.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.417
Unh!

12:41.458 --> 12:44.667
It's fine, Charlie.

12:41.458 --> 12:44.667
Don't be such a worry wart.

12:44.709 --> 12:48.417
If due caution defines a wart,

12:44.709 --> 12:48.417
I am proud to be one.

12:48.458 --> 12:52.083
Yeah. You know what they say

12:48.458 --> 12:52.083
about curiosity and the cat.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.250
Did it involve pajamas ?

12:56.834 --> 13:00.250
We agreed to stick together

12:56.834 --> 13:00.250
from now on, remember?

13:00.291 --> 13:02.250
I know, I'm sorry.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.250
But there's nothing

13:02.291 --> 13:04.250
to be afraid of.

has them pinned down!

We have

13:54.458 --> 13:55.917
to distract it!

Blades, what are you doing?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.709
You're hurt.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.291
You can't fly high enough

14:00.750 --> 14:02.291
to save them.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.709
I know.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.709
But I can fly high enough

to get someone who will.

you're okay.

for our family trip?

(  dramatic theme playing  )

Blades!

14:49.333 --> 14:51.458
That was noble!

14:51.500 --> 14:53.458
How'd you know the fish

14:51.500 --> 14:53.458
could get the Pterodactyl

14:53.500 --> 14:54.709
to leave us alone?

14:54.750 --> 14:57.083
I was inspired

14:54.750 --> 14:57.083
by Uncle Woodrow.

Well...

14:59.166 --> 15:02.875

15:04.917 --> 15:07.959
Ohh. Not exactly

No, but a fair observation.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.542
Ugh. Now what?

You're okay!

15:25.542 --> 15:27.792
I mean, uh...hey.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.792
We received your signal.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.792
Is everyone safe?

15:33.834 --> 15:35.208
For the time being.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.250
( pterodactyl shrieks )

15:39.166 --> 15:41.500
The sooner we can get home,

15:39.166 --> 15:41.500
the better.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.458
Then follow us, Chief.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.458
We found the way out...

15:44.500 --> 15:46.667
and a lot more.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.834
Wow!

15:49.000 --> 15:51.834
Shiny!

15:51.875 --> 15:53.959
Amazing.

15:51.875 --> 15:53.959
Sufficiently impressive.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.166
Incredible!

15:56.208 --> 15:59.083
So this is all

15:56.208 --> 15:59.083
pure Generon?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.750
Energon.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.875
It is the fuel and life blood

16:00.792 --> 16:03.875
that flows within us.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.917
Isn't it

16:05.041 --> 16:06.917
a little solid for that?

16:06.959 --> 16:09.667
This is unrefined Energon.

16:09.709 --> 16:14.583
And in this state,

16:09.709 --> 16:14.583
it is highly combustible.

Maybe we'd better

16:14.625 --> 16:18.041
keep moving.

Yeah, where's this

16:39.166 --> 16:41.667
Days? What are we

16:39.166 --> 16:41.667
supposed to do about food?

16:41.709 --> 16:44.291
Cave dwellers often live

16:41.709 --> 16:44.291
on blind grubs.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.250
They're quite nutritious.

16:46.291 --> 16:48.166
Get stuck

16:46.291 --> 16:48.166
in your teeth though.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.750
Ew, lovely.

16:49.792 --> 16:53.500
We need fresh water too.

16:49.792 --> 16:53.500
Dani, what about Blades?

16:53.542 --> 16:56.208
Well, he can't get much height

16:53.542 --> 16:56.208
with a damaged rotor.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.667
So--So we're--we're

16:56.250 --> 16:58.667
stuck down here?

16:58.709 --> 17:01.542
Sir, we will not allow

16:58.709 --> 17:01.542
any harm to come to your family.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.875
There has to be

17:01.583 --> 17:03.875
another way to the surface.

17:03.917 --> 17:07.000
Maybe Graham and I can create

17:03.917 --> 17:07.000
some sort of catapult device.

17:07.041 --> 17:10.125
It's too bad we can't just blast

17:07.041 --> 17:10.125
out of the volcano like lava.

17:10.166 --> 17:13.750
Blast? Yes!

17:10.166 --> 17:13.750
A giant bottle rocket!

17:13.792 --> 17:17.375
( giggles ):

17:13.792 --> 17:17.375
Like we made when

17:13.792 --> 17:17.375
we were kids, remember, Charlie?

17:17.417 --> 17:19.959
We ignite the Energon,

17:17.417 --> 17:19.959
then boom!

17:20.000 --> 17:23.208
We ride a platform up like

17:20.000 --> 17:23.208
a rocket-powered elevator.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.583
Will that actually work?

17:25.625 --> 17:28.458
Theoretically...

17:25.625 --> 17:28.458
Optimus?

17:28.500 --> 17:31.083
I hate to have to ask you

17:28.500 --> 17:31.083
to waste so much Energon--

17:31.125 --> 17:34.792
Chief Burns.

17:31.125 --> 17:34.792
Energon is replaceable.

17:34.834 --> 17:38.208
Human lives are not.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.375
First, we'll need to build

17:38.250 --> 17:41.375
a platform across this shaft.

17:41.417 --> 17:44.750
Then plant a fuse

17:41.417 --> 17:44.750
and seal the other passages.

17:44.792 --> 17:48.709
All right,

17:44.792 --> 17:48.709
let's move it, team!

17:48.750 --> 17:51.917
Sometimes Uncle Woodrow's

17:48.750 --> 17:51.917
pretty amazing, huh, Dad?

17:51.959 --> 17:55.458
All the time. But, uh,

17:51.959 --> 17:55.458
don't tell him I said that.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.083
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:02.583 --> 18:04.583
( grunting )

18:09.917 --> 18:11.917
( grunts )

18:13.542 --> 18:15.542
( grunts )

18:17.792 --> 18:21.500
Ready, Woodrow?

18:17.792 --> 18:21.500
Just like old times, Charlie.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.291
On my signal.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.917
One...

18:25.959 --> 18:28.000
Two...

18:28.041 --> 18:29.750
Three!

18:29.792 --> 18:31.458
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:36.834 --> 18:38.458
Oh.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.834
( grunts )

18:43.041 --> 18:44.792
( grunts )

18:47.542 --> 18:49.166
OPTIMUS:

18:47.542 --> 18:49.166
Rescue Bots...

18:49.208 --> 18:51.083
Blast off.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:35.500 --> 19:38.458
I hope someone

19:35.500 --> 19:38.458
got that on camera.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.709
( floor creaks )

19:40.458 --> 19:42.709
Woodrow?

19:42.750 --> 19:43.959
Oh, ah...

19:44.000 --> 19:45.709
The old

19:44.000 --> 19:45.709
creaky floorboard.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.625
Heh.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.625
Gets me every time.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.208
Where are you

19:47.667 --> 19:49.208
running off to?

19:49.250 --> 19:51.500
I thought you were planning

19:49.250 --> 19:51.500
to stay the week.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.917
Go fishing, catch up.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.625
I was, Charlie.

19:54.667 --> 19:59.291
But all we saw--aliens,

19:54.667 --> 19:59.291
prehistoric creatures,

19:59.333 --> 20:01.959
Energon--

19:59.333 --> 20:01.959
it made me realize.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.500
There's so much

20:02.000 --> 20:04.500
out there to explore.

20:04.542 --> 20:06.250
I can't waste

20:04.542 --> 20:06.250
any more time here.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.041
Like I am?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.417
I didn't say that.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.792
You're an incredible father

20:11.458 --> 20:14.792
and a great Police Chief.

20:14.834 --> 20:18.417
If I could be those things,

20:14.834 --> 20:18.417
heh, I would.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.917
But I'm an adventurer.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.917
And you're...

20:20.959 --> 20:23.959
An adventurer's brother.

20:26.417 --> 20:28.625
Heh, heh, heh.

20:26.417 --> 20:28.625
You be careful, Woodrow.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.750
And the next time

20:28.667 --> 20:30.750
you're in Maine,

20:30.792 --> 20:32.417
we'll have dinner

20:30.792 --> 20:32.417
waiting for you.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.959
Uncle Woodrow?

20:40.542 --> 20:42.375
Why didn't he

20:40.542 --> 20:42.375
say goodbye, Dad?

20:42.417 --> 20:44.667
That's Woodrow's way,

20:42.417 --> 20:44.667
Cody.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.417
But he's never

20:44.709 --> 20:46.417
really gone.

20:46.458 --> 20:50.583
We just keep him

20:46.458 --> 20:50.583
in a different spot.

20:50.625 --> 20:54.917
OPTIMUS:

20:50.625 --> 20:54.917
I am pleased with your progress,

20:50.625 --> 20:54.917
Sigma Seventeen.

20:54.959 --> 20:57.500
Continue your mission.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:59.875 --> 21:01.667
Heatwave?

21:05.417 --> 21:09.917
Heatwave, you have grown

21:05.417 --> 21:09.917
into a strong leader.

21:09.959 --> 21:13.333
I believe you are ready

21:09.959 --> 21:13.333
for greater responsibilities.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.583
Sir?

21:14.625 --> 21:18.333
Be prepared

21:14.625 --> 21:18.333
when the time comes.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.333
