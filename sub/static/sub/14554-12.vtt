WEBVTT

00:30.731 --> 00:31.699
Daddy.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.201
Yeah ?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.368
Why are you jogging ?

00:34.402 --> 00:37.138
Because I gotta lose
40 pounds.

00:37.171 --> 00:37.705
40 pounds ?
Yeah.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.173
Why ?

00:39.207 --> 00:43.211
Well, if I want to get
this show, I need to--

00:43.244 --> 00:44.512
I gotta change.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.447
They want a skinnier person.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.217
Daddy, but you're
not skinnier.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.618
Daddy, you're fat, Daddy.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.552
Jane...

00:51.585 --> 00:54.088
It's all right, it's true,
I'm a big guy.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.224
You're not a big guy,
you're fat.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.725
All right, I got it.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.193
Daddy.
Yeah ?

00:59.227 --> 01:00.428
If they
want a skinny person,

01:00.461 --> 01:02.363
why don't they just get
someone skinny ?

01:02.396 --> 01:05.133
Why do
you have to change ?

01:05.166 --> 01:08.302
Daddy, I don't want
you to change.

01:08.336 --> 01:11.272
It's not really about
skinny or fat, it's just--

01:11.305 --> 01:13.307
You know, if you want to get a
big thing in life, you--

01:13.341 --> 01:15.709
you gotta make a big
effort, you gotta try hard,

01:15.743 --> 01:19.447
you gotta do things
you're not used to doing.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.749
I mean, also I gotta get
in shape because this job--

01:21.782 --> 01:23.584
If I get this job, this is
gonna be hard.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.553
This is gonna be
the hardest thing I ever did.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.756
I'm gonna be doing five
shows a week every week.

01:28.789 --> 01:29.990
Getting up
early in the morning,

01:30.023 --> 01:32.293
every single Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

01:32.326 --> 01:34.495
doing shows, rehearsing
and writing.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.264
It's gonna be a grind.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.631
But when will you
see us ?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.271
I'll see
you on weekends.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.279
You know, girls, I may not
get this job.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.514
Yeah, but you want this
job, right ?

02:00.821 --> 02:01.822
Yeah.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.325
Yeah.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.328
Well, all right.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.299
Yes.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.134
No.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.837
No.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.807
No to that, too.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.510
Yes.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.379
All right.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.649
No !

02:35.323 --> 02:38.359
So you want to take over
for Letterman ?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.161
You want
to host "Late Show" on CBS ?

02:44.365 --> 02:45.799
Yeah, that's...

02:45.833 --> 02:48.736
Here's the thing with
that, champ.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.272
That's short for "champion."

02:51.305 --> 02:52.473
If you want
to be a talk show host,

02:52.506 --> 02:55.276
it's better
if you're funny.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.512
Now, there have been some
guys who were not funny.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.381
Tom Snyder.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.350
David Susskind.

03:02.383 --> 03:05.553
Ted Koppel.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.656
But funny is better.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.260
Now, have you ever had any
experience with being funny ?

03:14.462 --> 03:18.666
Yeah, I'm a...
I'm a comedian.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.435
You're a comedian ?

03:21.469 --> 03:25.406
I've known you for a week and
you haven't made me laugh once.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.840
I had no idea you were
a comedian.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.510
I thought
you were a newsman.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.246
No, I'm not a newsman,
I'm a-- I'm a comedian.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.382
Jesus.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.884
Well, all right, let's
see it.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.552
See what ?

03:38.586 --> 03:40.454
See the funny, make
me laugh.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.855
Go.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.524
Go ?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.459
Go... funny.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.595
Three, two, one...
and go !

03:47.628 --> 03:49.863
I'm not that kind
of funny.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.532
What kind of funny ?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.402
The kind where you jut say
"go" and I'm funny.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.370
All right, I think you'd
better leave my office.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.406
Jack-- Mr. Dahl, I--

03:58.439 --> 04:00.641
Look, there's different
kinds of funny, right ?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.444
There's different kinds
of performers.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.912
I'm not
that kind of performer.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.415
Let me tell me what kind
of what you are.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.351
You're whatever you have
to be to make people laugh.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.421
Anytime, anywhere, anyone.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.423
You turn it on a dime.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.392
You get that belly moving, son,
or you're out.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.394
Now tell the truth.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.397
You're just scared, like
a rookie.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.466
You're like some kid at a
talent show

04:25.499 --> 04:27.768
with a number pinned to
your shirt.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.741
You got nothing
or you would have shown me now.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.576
So get out.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.446
Thank you,
have a nice day.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.947
Fine.

04:46.487 --> 04:50.491
Look, I-- I-- I can't give
up on this.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.494
I don't, uh...

04:53.527 --> 04:55.463
This is either a door or
a wall for me

04:55.496 --> 04:56.964
and it's either
the beginning or the end.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.468
I don't-- Please.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.603
Okay then...
let's see the funny.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.672
Three, two, one, go !

05:04.705 --> 05:06.006
Funny !

05:11.412 --> 05:12.946
This is it, bud.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.548
You want me to start at
one and go up ?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.650
One, two, three, funny.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.956
Okay, last chance and then
we're really done.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.493
Done and done.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.495
Let's go, kid, you want
the big gig ?

05:27.528 --> 05:28.829
Let's see it.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.499
Make me laugh at the count
of three.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.434
One...

05:33.467 --> 05:35.002
Two...

05:35.035 --> 05:37.871
You know what your
problem is ?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.707
You're--

05:39.740 --> 05:43.477
You're just a pencil...

05:43.511 --> 05:45.713
penis...

05:45.746 --> 05:48.682
parade.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.984
( blowing raspberry )

05:51.018 --> 05:52.486
Ooh, I'm--

05:52.520 --> 05:53.754
( speaking gibberish )

05:53.787 --> 05:55.022
Nyah !

05:55.055 --> 05:57.425
( blowing raspberry )

06:02.696 --> 06:05.833
You just bought yourself
another week.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.435
Go home
and get some rest.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.647
Please leave this room.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.429
Sit down.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.867
No, genius, sit in the
host's chair,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.935
for crying in a cup.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.579
Okay, interviews.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.616
We-- What ?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.851
Conduct an interview !

07:00.788 --> 07:02.490
There's nobody here.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.526
Well, go get someone.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.660
What ?

07:08.496 --> 07:10.430
Just a sec.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.134
Jesus Christ.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.805
This is Elaine.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.107
She cleans here.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.543
Have a seat, Elaine.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.844
Please.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.554
Okay.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.688
Interviews.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.660
Hello.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.628
"Hello" ?

07:40.661 --> 07:41.962
You just introduced her !

07:41.995 --> 07:44.665
You played a song, you
kissed her, she sat down !

07:44.698 --> 07:46.534
"Hello..." what is that ?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.804
Uh... how are you ?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.606
How is she ?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.775
Find out, ask a question.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.677
I can't--
Ask !

07:56.710 --> 07:58.612
If you would stop yelling
at me, maybe I'd do it right.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.614
If you did it right, I
wouldn't have to yell at you.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.149
Interview.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.817
Go !

08:06.186 --> 08:08.656
Uh...

08:08.689 --> 08:10.791
Tell me about your parents.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.629
Oh, well, my mother was
actually dancer.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.130
Really ?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.966
What kind of dancer
was she ?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.702
She was in the ballet.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.970
Really ?

08:23.003 --> 08:26.173
Did she dance
around the house a lot ?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.975
I don't know.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.612
I don't remember much.

08:31.645 --> 08:37.017
She died
when I was eight.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.753
( sobbing )

08:42.856 --> 08:45.626
Oh, this is terrific,
just wonderful.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.160
Tune in
every night, folks !

08:47.194 --> 08:48.962
It's the crying cleaning
lady show.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.059
Okay.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.228
Good evening, okay, hi !

09:21.261 --> 09:22.830
Shit.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.207
Good evening.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.743
Asshole !

09:35.776 --> 09:37.110
Shit, cock.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.881
Dick, dick, ass, shit.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.750
Tits.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.821
Okay.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.256
Okay...

09:51.725 --> 09:54.261
Funny in three, two--

09:54.294 --> 09:56.596
( doorbell ringing )

10:02.102 --> 10:04.237
Hey.
Daddy.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.239
What's up, everybody ?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.776
They insisted I bring them
over here.

10:08.809 --> 10:12.646
They just wanted to wish you
luck for your big day tomorrow.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.247
Thanks.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.749
( Lilly )
Daddy, we made you
a card.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.793
Daddy, we just wanted to
wish you luck for tomorrow.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.695
We know you can
do it.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.360
( knocking )

11:35.763 --> 11:37.898
Hey, Jack.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.878
Here you go, buster, I had
this made for you.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.846
It's beautiful, Jack...
thank you.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.752
Well, I did my part.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.021
This will be the last time
we see each other.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.255
Oh.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.758
If you get the show, they'll
bring in some young producer.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.227
If you don't, well then,
that'll be that.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.229
In any case,
I told you what I know

12:09.262 --> 12:11.865
and the rest is up
to you.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.801
It's just...

12:13.834 --> 12:15.402
if you can do it.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.037
That's it.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.271
Listen.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.807
You're a good guy.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.241
I'm not gonna
say I think you can do it

12:21.274 --> 12:23.911
'cause I really have
no idea,

12:23.944 --> 12:25.946
but I hope you do.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.950
And now I'm gonna tell you
what I know to be

12:29.983 --> 12:33.854
the three
rules of show business.

12:33.887 --> 12:38.325
Number one, look 'em in the eye
and speak from the heart.

12:38.358 --> 12:43.063
Number two, you
gotta go away to come back.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.834
And number three, if someone
asks you to keep a secret,

12:46.867 --> 12:48.969
their secret is a lie.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.437
You got that ?

12:50.470 --> 12:51.939
Yeah.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.941
Uh, thank-- thank you, Jack.

12:53.974 --> 12:54.975
Thanks for everything,
really.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.480
Good luck.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.933
How you doing ?

13:19.967 --> 13:22.135
Jerry, hi...
How are you ?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.336
Good, good.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.038
You nervous ?

13:25.072 --> 13:27.040
Uh, no, you know.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.943
Ahh, you'll be fine,
you'll be fine.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.945
I--

13:31.979 --> 13:34.447
I didn't know that they--
that you knew I was--

13:34.481 --> 13:38.886
Look, Louie, there's
something you need to know.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.320
Okay.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.956
They're giving me
"Late Show."

13:42.990 --> 13:45.025
I signed
the contract this morning.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.894
It's a done deal.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.096
They're printing
the t-shirts.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.966
I heard they
weren't telling you

13:53.000 --> 13:54.467
and they were still making
you do this

13:54.501 --> 13:57.237
and it
just seemed unfair.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.473
Wow.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.042
Yeah.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.081
Well, congrats.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.150
Thank you, thank you.

14:10.183 --> 14:14.054
I mean, I want you to come
on the show anytime you want.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.189
Thanks.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.525
That's it.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.062
Um, thanks for--

14:22.095 --> 14:24.031
Okay, Louie.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.332
You will be fine.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.268
Thanks, man.
I will see you soon.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.041
Hey, um, nobody knows about
this yet,

14:34.074 --> 14:35.943
so if you
wouldn't mind, do me a favor.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.244
Keep it a secret.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.115
Sure.
Thank you.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.984
Thank you.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.256
"If somebody asks you to
keep a secret..."

14:49.289 --> 14:52.225
"That secret is a lie."

14:52.259 --> 14:55.062
It's a lie.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.034
( bleep )

15:01.068 --> 15:04.004
Goddammit.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.539
Welcome to
the "Late Show."

15:06.573 --> 15:07.975
Let's get right to it.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.610
Here's your host,
Louis C.K. !

15:13.981 --> 15:17.117
( cheering and applauding )

15:22.322 --> 15:24.958
Thank you very much.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.427
Obama said the economy will
improve in the next four years.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.397
He also said he promises
to kill bin Laden

15:30.430 --> 15:31.965
a couple more times.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.967
( studio audience laughing )

15:34.001 --> 15:35.602
You know, jokes-- It's a really
unique thing

15:35.635 --> 15:37.337
to be
reading jokes off cards,

15:37.370 --> 15:40.073
'cause you just see your
death in front of you.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.941
You can see-

15:43.276 --> 15:46.479
Uh, Polly want to not get
eaten by a dog ?

15:46.513 --> 15:48.181
( audience chuckling )

15:50.117 --> 15:51.451
All right.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.286
( audience laughing )

15:56.656 --> 15:58.158
I don't know.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.260
I'm not saying nothing
about that... just--

16:00.293 --> 16:02.595
( applause )

16:05.465 --> 16:07.467
Well, the first
time I ever saw you,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.002
I guess I was about 11
years old

16:09.036 --> 16:11.138
and I saw
"Rocky Horror Picture Show."

16:11.171 --> 16:12.439
You were in that movie
a lot.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.207
I was, yeah.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.642
And you were in your
underwear for part of it.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.177
Yeah.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.446
And I had never seen a
lady in her underwear

16:19.479 --> 16:21.214
in a movie before.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.149
Was it scarring ?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.550
No, what it was --

16:23.583 --> 16:25.618
What it did was,
I went home...

16:25.652 --> 16:27.520
( audience laughing )

16:27.554 --> 16:31.058
... to my friend's house.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.160
Oh, boy.
And I--

16:33.193 --> 16:36.296
Yeah, and I had myself
a little time by myself.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.331
And I had never done
that before.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.067
So you--

16:40.100 --> 16:41.568
That was the first time ?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.636
Yeah, that's true, you're
the first person who I ever--

16:43.670 --> 16:46.173
Oh my God, that's the
sweetest story I ever heard.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.107
That's so sweet...
Thank you.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.576
Yeah, thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.211
( audience laughing
and applauding )

16:51.244 --> 16:53.480
Jack is my son and Darby
is my daughter.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.215
Darby ?
Yeah.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.084
What is that all about ?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.518
Um, well, yeah.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.220
What'd you go and do
that for ?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.288
I know.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.157
My wife said, "I want to
name my daughter 'Darby.'"

17:04.191 --> 17:07.194
And she said, "I loved
the name ever since I saw

17:07.227 --> 17:11.398
"'The Pelican Brief' with
Julia Roberts."

17:11.431 --> 17:14.267
Are you serious ?
I swear to God.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.069
What I wished was
the truth,

17:16.103 --> 17:18.171
and I don't think it is,

17:18.205 --> 17:22.209
is that there's no one
named Darby in that movie.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.176
And that you just--

17:23.210 --> 17:25.212
( audience applauding )

17:26.246 --> 17:28.248
( phone ringing )

17:30.250 --> 17:32.252
Jackie, I'm watching
the feed.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.720
Good work.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.688
It's exactly what we need.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.390
Perfect.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.560
I got an option.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.265
Here's to the new king of
late night.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.733
Oh, thank you.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.401
Former king of his own
mother's ( bleep ).

17:48.435 --> 17:49.602
Mmm.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.703
I gotta say,
you stepped up.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.639
Great job.
Thanks, man.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.241
I don't know if it--

17:54.274 --> 17:55.575
You know, it's not official,
but I feel pretty good.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.244
I mean...

17:58.245 --> 18:00.580
Doug.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.416
Hey, turn up that TV,
that's about my buddy.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.417
( woman )
Hold on a second.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.186
Shut up, everybody.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.255
Official word just coming in
from CBS that David Letterman

18:08.288 --> 18:11.258
has signed
on for another ten years.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.426
His contract negotiations went
to the last minute we hear,

18:13.460 --> 18:14.694
but it is official.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.630
David Letterman will remain
as the host of "The Late Show."

18:23.336 --> 18:24.437
They used you to get
his price down

18:24.471 --> 18:26.506
from 60 to 40 million.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.576
They used you.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.311
There's one other thing.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.480
The Letterman people called.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.582
They said...

18:35.615 --> 18:37.750
You're dead.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.287
Letterman said
you'll never be on the show.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.121
Never.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.325
Okay.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.294
Lou... look at it
this way.

18:47.327 --> 18:51.231
You took $20 million
out of that asshole's pocket.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.600
That's how
good you were.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.235
Thanks, man.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.304
I'm sorry.
Bad deal, man.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.805
I'm sorry.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.474
It's official, you
suck, man.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.243
He does, too.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.211
I'm just kidding.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.412
I'm not.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.376
I did it !

19:37.510 --> 19:39.346
I did it !

19:40.847 --> 19:42.815
I did it !

19:42.849 --> 19:45.318
Hey, Letterman !

19:45.352 --> 19:47.454
Hey, Letterman,
I did it !

19:48.588 --> 19:50.257
Yo, Letterman !

19:50.290 --> 19:51.624
Letterman !

19:53.393 --> 19:55.262
( bleep ) you !

20:15.348 --> 20:17.717
( man )
Jab... jab.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.218
Jab, hop.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.688
Jab, hop.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.623
Jab, hop.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.325
Throw that power.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.393
You throw that right.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.695
I want you pushing off on
that back foot, okay ?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.797
Okay ?

20:30.830 --> 20:32.365
Right, right.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.866
Let's go.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.867
There you go.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.569
Lean into it, lean
into it.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.271
Yeah.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.872
Double jab.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.541
Double jab.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.909
Double jab right.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.378
Again.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.414
Jab uppercut.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.548
Jab uppercut.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.249
Jab uppercut.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.355
Boom-- make
it quick, okay ?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.890
And then come back with
that right, okay ?

20:57.924 --> 20:58.891
Just come back with
the right...

20:58.925 --> 21:00.427
Ready, let's go.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.395
Again.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.930
Okay.
