00:38.421 --> 00:41.130
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful princess

00:41.213 --> 00:43.713
who lived in a big castle.

00:47.796 --> 00:50.046
Actually, the princess was a nice girl

00:50.130 --> 00:52.380
who lived in a huge house
that she had inherited,

00:52.463 --> 00:55.213
and half of her salary went
to maintaining it.

00:57.505 --> 01:00.046
The princess was full of optimism,

01:00.130 --> 01:04.754
dreams, hopes, and tons of carbohydrates.

01:06.421 --> 01:08.921
But now, all that's left are the carbs.

01:09.921 --> 01:13.880
How does a nice, good-hearted princess,

01:13.963 --> 01:17.088
who is capable of eating
a family-size pizza by herself,

01:17.255 --> 01:18.546
end up like this?

01:18.838 --> 01:21.213
Just like everything
that's wrong with the world,

01:21.296 --> 01:22.796
it's the fault of...

01:24.213 --> 01:25.213
a man.

01:25.755 --> 01:28.505
THE DAY BEFORE

01:28.796 --> 01:29.671
No!

01:38.755 --> 01:41.421
- Hi, lovebug!
- Hi, Fe.

01:42.255 --> 01:45.588
Finally, my love!

01:46.213 --> 01:49.630
I wasn't able to talk much these days,
but I promise I'll make it up to you!

01:49.713 --> 01:51.796
Listen,
I want to talk to you about something.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.588
I know that last time we were talking

01:54.671 --> 01:58.005
about how the distance sucks.
It really sucks.

01:58.088 --> 01:59.421
We both get weird.

01:59.505 --> 02:01.880
Yes, yes.
I want to talk to you about that.

02:01.963 --> 02:06.255
And it's clearly making us feel weird.
Of course we're going to feel weird.

02:06.338 --> 02:10.005
Though I have to say
the phone sex hasn't been bad.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.588
Though I get nervous
about the United States listening

02:12.671 --> 02:15.130
to our calls because...
that's embarrassing!

02:15.213 --> 02:17.880
- Fe.
- What? What do you want to say?

02:18.921 --> 02:21.963
I've been thinking. I don't know...

02:24.755 --> 02:28.046
I'm sorry to say this here, okay? But...

02:30.046 --> 02:31.880
I think that we need...

02:32.880 --> 02:34.213
a break, okay?

02:36.588 --> 02:37.505
A break?

02:39.546 --> 02:42.046
- When? How?
- A break.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.296
Look...

02:46.380 --> 02:50.963
I think that we need more space.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.921
More space?

02:56.046 --> 02:58.546
Ten-thousand kilometers
isn't enough for you?

02:58.630 --> 02:59.630
Fe...

03:00.255 --> 03:01.546
you know what I mean.

03:02.046 --> 03:02.963
No.

03:08.671 --> 03:09.671
Damn...

03:11.130 --> 03:12.463
I'm really sorry.

03:13.463 --> 03:16.630
I didn't want it to be like this.

03:17.255 --> 03:18.796
I don't get it. Are you break...

03:19.963 --> 03:21.880
Are you breaking up with me?

03:28.630 --> 03:31.505
I think it's for the best.
Seeing as I'm not...

03:31.588 --> 03:33.171
- Yes? What?
- I think...

03:33.255 --> 03:35.296
- I think we need...
- No. Hello?

03:35.380 --> 03:37.713
- ...space.
- Hello? Hi?

03:37.796 --> 03:39.421
- It's not me...
- Hello?

03:39.505 --> 03:41.963
Matías? Hello, Matías?

03:42.046 --> 03:43.880
Hello?

03:54.755 --> 03:57.380
They say that grief has five stages.

03:57.463 --> 04:00.963
I went through all of them in one night.
And over WhatsApp.

04:03.255 --> 04:06.213
Hey, lovebug, honey.
How are you? Listen...

04:06.296 --> 04:08.463
I understand what you're going through,
okay?

04:08.546 --> 04:09.755
It will pass.

04:09.838 --> 04:10.963
DENIAL

04:11.046 --> 04:13.505
Besides, Mercury's in retrograde,
the Moon's waxing,

04:13.588 --> 04:15.421
and we're all basically water!

04:15.505 --> 04:19.796
So take it easy, rest up, and call me
when you're better so we can talk.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.005
Kisses. I love you. Take it easy.

04:22.338 --> 04:25.671
Are you seriously not going to reply?
Really?

04:25.755 --> 04:26.921
ANGER

04:27.005 --> 04:31.296
Do you think this is what I deserve
after six years in this relationship?

04:31.380 --> 04:34.546
Huh? No!
Well, I have news for you, Matías.

04:34.630 --> 04:36.963
You're not the ideal size. Okay?

04:37.046 --> 04:41.421
You're far from it!
The ideal size is big! You idiot!

04:41.505 --> 04:45.546
You screwed up! I'm never going to Madrid,
and it's all your fault!

04:45.755 --> 04:49.838
Who the hell buys a board game
in Portuguese?

04:50.130 --> 04:52.088
Fucking hipster!

04:55.880 --> 05:00.213
You'll never play me like this again!

05:00.838 --> 05:03.130
Listen, Matías, I've been thinking.

05:04.505 --> 05:08.671
This can't happen again, okay?
We can't disrespect each other like this.

05:08.755 --> 05:11.005
It's a line we can't cross, okay?

05:11.088 --> 05:12.630
BARGAINING

05:12.713 --> 05:16.713
Now, I understand there are things
that you don't like about me.

05:17.338 --> 05:19.838
I don't know what they are.
You never told me.

05:20.505 --> 05:24.088
There are things I don't like about you,
but I'm not throwing them in your face.

05:24.171 --> 05:27.338
And if you want me to change, well,
we'll talk about it.

05:27.421 --> 05:28.921
Everything in life is change.

05:29.005 --> 05:32.796
Then there's resistance to change,
and then change again.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.755
So if you want me to change, I will.

05:35.505 --> 05:40.713
I'm willing to eat pineapple pizza,
Matías.

05:40.796 --> 05:43.130
WON'T YOU REPLY?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

05:43.213 --> 05:44.880
Pineapple pizza.

05:46.671 --> 05:50.671
DEPRESSION

05:55.130 --> 05:58.755
I SEE THAT YOU'RE ONLINE

06:03.838 --> 06:07.838
ACCEPTANCE

06:14.630 --> 06:17.546
NETFLIX PRESENTS

06:24.380 --> 06:27.421
If there is something positive
about waking up

06:27.505 --> 06:32.796
in an empty bathtub, hungover,
and with pizza in your hair...

06:33.088 --> 06:36.380
it's the deceptive feeling that,
from here on,

06:36.463 --> 06:38.671
things can only get better.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.963
María Fe Palacios,
you will not be that kind of girl.

06:53.005 --> 06:54.296
She's not opening the door?

06:55.046 --> 06:57.880
No, she already opened it.
It's just that I love standing here,

06:57.963 --> 07:01.338
waiting to grow gills
with this lovely humidity, Santiago.

07:02.963 --> 07:05.380
I love the humidity. Mexico is too dry.

07:05.463 --> 07:07.005
Lima's climate is perfect.

07:07.088 --> 07:09.963
You say that because you've only
lived here for 45 minutes.

07:10.088 --> 07:12.046
No, I've been here for three years.

07:12.130 --> 07:14.088
And you still can't get rid
of your accent?

07:15.421 --> 07:17.713
We haven't seen each other
since that time, right?

07:17.796 --> 07:19.755
It's been ages! Go figure.

07:20.338 --> 07:23.213
- Since Fe's party?
- Since your ex-boss's going-away party.

07:23.713 --> 07:25.755
You have such a good memory.

07:31.088 --> 07:32.088
Fe!

07:34.588 --> 07:37.755
So, are you here to have breakfast
with my friend?

07:38.005 --> 07:38.838
Or what?

07:42.046 --> 07:44.380
Yes, you, with a penis...

07:44.463 --> 07:51.046
Tell me, what do you have in there,
where your heart is supposed to be?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.171
I guess you received one of these, too.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.421
Seven, and the last two were
of her singing Alejandro Sanz.

07:56.671 --> 07:58.671
Alejandro Sanz from the 2000s
or the 1990s?

07:58.755 --> 07:59.880
From the '90s.

08:00.963 --> 08:02.338
Hey.

08:02.588 --> 08:04.546
Hey, friends!

08:04.630 --> 08:06.713
What are you doing here? How are you?

08:06.796 --> 08:08.421
We've been calling you all day.

08:08.505 --> 08:10.296
I didn't hear because of my headphones.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.755
- Can I borrow this?
- Sure.

08:11.838 --> 08:13.421
Did you come to take me to work?

08:13.505 --> 08:16.255
We were worried,
because of what happened last night.

08:18.338 --> 08:22.046
Matías and I broke up, but don't worry.
Everything's fine.

08:22.130 --> 08:26.088
But thanks for coming, my friend.
You're the best. I love you.

08:26.171 --> 08:29.046
But I'm not gonna get dramatic
like a 16-year-old girl, right?

08:29.130 --> 08:30.463
Life goes on.

08:30.546 --> 08:33.296
- It's a new day. Let's go and get to work.
- Hold on.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.380
Are you sure you don't need
to stay in bed, cry a bit,

08:36.462 --> 08:37.546
or eat some ice cream?

08:37.630 --> 08:38.712
Or fuck somebody?

08:38.796 --> 08:41.880
No, I really don't need any of that.
What I need is to get to work.

08:41.962 --> 08:43.087
Let's go. Think fast.

08:44.130 --> 08:46.463
I got it. Okay, go with him. It's fine.

08:46.546 --> 08:48.380
- All right, that's the spirit.
- Right!

08:48.463 --> 08:50.213
I'll call you later so we can talk.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.671
- I could sleep over.
- I'm fine, my friend.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.755
- Okay, don't drive fast.
- Bye, beautiful.

08:58.796 --> 08:59.838
Sure you're okay?

09:00.213 --> 09:01.963
- Stop it, I'm fine!
- Okay.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.338
I'm sure he likes you,
he's always smiling...

09:06.421 --> 09:08.671
Santiago, here's your decaf latte.

09:08.963 --> 09:10.880
You're the best person in this office.

09:10.963 --> 09:13.255
- After you!
- My friend!

09:15.755 --> 09:17.588
Don't kid yourself, it's not gonna happen.

09:17.671 --> 09:19.130
You never know.

09:19.338 --> 09:21.588
- Let's go.
- We're flanning. Flanning.

09:21.671 --> 09:23.380
Let's get flanning.

09:24.546 --> 09:25.838
Flan-tastic.

09:25.921 --> 09:27.546
- Flan-atic.
- Flan-atic.

09:28.546 --> 09:30.796
Let's start creating. The word flan.

09:31.213 --> 09:32.963
Look at what I have, Ramiro.

09:33.046 --> 09:35.796
If we want intrigue,
we could launch something like...

09:35.880 --> 09:38.005
- Flan, flan, flan, flan...
- I like that.

09:38.088 --> 09:39.838
- Flan, flan, flan!
- More of the same.

09:39.921 --> 09:42.671
Wouldn't you like some delicious
flan-ch toast for breakfast?

09:42.755 --> 09:43.671
Good!

09:43.755 --> 09:46.838
Give us this day... our daily flan.

09:46.921 --> 09:48.796
- Fluorescent.
- Yes, fluorescent.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.296
- Fluorescent doesn't have "flan" in it.
- The young lady's killed our creativity.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.838
- What? Fine, I won't say anything.
- Let's wrap this up.

09:56.046 --> 09:57.713
Charly has something to say.

09:57.796 --> 09:59.671
I was saying that, once again,

09:59.755 --> 10:02.046
- we have exceeded expectations.
- Exceeded!

10:02.130 --> 10:05.671
The cocktail potato campaign
has reached 50,000 views.

10:05.755 --> 10:09.630
And not just that,
the hashtag that we created is trending.

10:09.713 --> 10:10.588
Trending topic!

10:10.671 --> 10:12.380
- Gastón himself shared it.
- Gastón!

10:12.463 --> 10:15.171
Very good! Congratulations, genius!

10:15.713 --> 10:16.546
Thanks, Rami.

10:16.630 --> 10:17.671
A round of applause.

10:17.755 --> 10:20.046
- Applaud.
- Give him a hand.

10:20.338 --> 10:21.755
We're working on something for Cannes.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.671
Diego, make sure
that account planning inflates the results

10:24.755 --> 10:26.505
to show more sales potential.
Mafe, what are you up to?

10:26.755 --> 10:30.296
I've just finished the campaign
for the cream, Smoothness.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.921
You did what I said, right?
You used women's empowerment and all that?

10:34.005 --> 10:36.088
Yes, "smoother skin, stronger women."

10:36.171 --> 10:39.713
Add some color to it, add some flowers,
make it look more feminine.

10:39.796 --> 10:41.130
He can help you.

10:43.046 --> 10:46.630
Nobody makes fun of them here.
It's not contagious.

10:47.713 --> 10:48.796
Just joking, okay?

10:49.838 --> 10:52.505
- You're doing the pads?
- Yes. I finished the campaign.

10:52.588 --> 10:54.505
A small one for Facebook,
but it's ready.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.671
- So you can take the cooking oil campaign.
- The cooking oil!

10:57.963 --> 11:01.171
It's a good one. It has flavor,
it's got personality. You'll like it.

11:01.255 --> 11:04.338
It's also street-smart.
Great. Let's do this, babe.

11:04.421 --> 11:05.838
Let's make it tasty.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.546
Give it some spice.

11:09.671 --> 11:11.588
Now, I have to choose...

11:12.921 --> 11:16.963
which of you will be in charge
of our new client's campaign.

11:17.046 --> 11:19.671
The annual and regional campaign.

11:20.463 --> 11:21.588
Who's up for it?

11:22.130 --> 11:24.338
Rami,
Charly and I are very busy right now.

11:24.421 --> 11:25.796
No, we're not very busy.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.046
In advertising, you can't be too busy.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.546
There's no such thing.
I'm going to tell you a story.

11:31.338 --> 11:33.546
The year was 1994,
and I thought I was too busy.

11:34.088 --> 11:37.380
I was assigned
Coca-Cola's regional campaign.

11:37.463 --> 11:38.713
Coca-Cola, okay?

11:39.630 --> 11:42.921
I created it while I was in the shower.
Boom! It was a hit.

11:43.005 --> 11:46.046
Five Golden Lion Awards.
I thought I was too busy.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.713
Excuse me, Ramiro,
but I'd like to do that campaign.

11:48.796 --> 11:50.546
You're too busy with the cooking oil.

11:51.588 --> 11:52.713
- Who can do it?
- I can.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.171
- But you're...
- No, I'm done. I just finished it.

11:58.463 --> 11:59.630
That's enough!

12:00.255 --> 12:02.796
- Mafe will do it.
- Great. What's the product?

12:03.380 --> 12:04.505
Tissues.

12:04.921 --> 12:07.380
It's what women like. Time to cry, honey.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.713
Sound good?

12:08.796 --> 12:11.880
There is one thing
you can always count on,

12:11.963 --> 12:16.005
and that is the universe's
twisted sense of humor.

12:45.755 --> 12:46.588
Fe...

12:47.255 --> 12:50.130
I left six months ago,
and you still haven't fixed that door?

12:51.921 --> 12:54.088
Are you waiting for me
to come back and fix it?

12:56.963 --> 12:57.921
I like it like this.

12:58.796 --> 13:03.213
Yeah, it gives it an air of...
I saw it on Pinterest.

13:05.380 --> 13:11.171
This isn't happening. He's not here.
He's in my head.

13:11.963 --> 13:14.213
In my head...

13:14.296 --> 13:15.171
It's in my head.

13:27.255 --> 13:29.796
Are you watching Game of Thrones
without me?

13:29.963 --> 13:31.755
- That's sacrilege.
- Listen...

13:32.421 --> 13:34.630
You've got some nerve.
You broke up with me.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.463
I can watch any series I feel like.

13:36.546 --> 13:40.546
Yeah, but this is like pure hate.
Are you declaring war against me?

13:40.630 --> 13:42.421
Sorry, there's nothing you can do.

13:44.130 --> 13:46.630
I can show up
every time there's a sex scene.

13:46.713 --> 13:48.546
So I can remind you of when we...

14:00.630 --> 14:03.130
This is the best bed in the world.

14:03.546 --> 14:05.546
Holy shit...

14:06.046 --> 14:08.380
Remember the first night
we slept in this house?

14:08.630 --> 14:11.630
There was only this mattress.
There wasn't anything else here.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.671
Not even a table for us to eat on.

14:14.213 --> 14:17.213
But I opened a bottle of wine...

14:17.755 --> 14:19.546
and we just talked for three hours.

14:22.796 --> 14:26.421
And then I couldn't stop laughing
because we spilled the wine.

14:27.755 --> 14:29.880
We spent hours cleaning that up.

14:30.838 --> 14:32.463
We threw salt on the rug, right?

14:34.005 --> 14:36.546
I always remember that, too.

14:49.755 --> 14:52.296
You've been getting me
out of bed for two weeks at 11 p.m.,

14:52.380 --> 14:54.005
and you make me come over.

14:54.463 --> 14:57.130
I can't do this anymore. I'm serious.

14:58.088 --> 14:59.296
I'm sorry.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.880
Look, I know you're going
through a rough patch.

15:02.963 --> 15:04.630
It's shitty, I know.

15:05.588 --> 15:07.213
But, know what I think?

15:07.463 --> 15:10.338
You shouldn't live here by yourself.
This house is too big.

15:10.421 --> 15:11.796
That's why you're like this.

15:13.130 --> 15:14.713
Why don't we look for a roommate?

15:15.255 --> 15:16.963
- Move in with me.
- No.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.796
- Please.
- No way.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.546
We'd kill each other.
We wouldn't last one week.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.380
Besides, I've just renewed my lease.
I can't.

15:25.755 --> 15:26.755
Fine.

15:28.463 --> 15:30.630
I can help you find a roommate
if you'd like.

15:30.713 --> 15:32.505
We can set up interviews. How about it?

15:34.130 --> 15:37.546
No, I'm fine like this, really.

15:37.630 --> 15:38.880
I'll get over it.

15:52.463 --> 15:54.463
Okay, help me find a roommate.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.505
Yes, tomorrow.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.130
- Are you serious?
- Yes, please.

15:58.338 --> 16:00.088
Hi, Romina, how are you? I'm Natalia.

16:00.171 --> 16:01.671
- Hi!
- Nice to meet you.

16:01.755 --> 16:03.088
- Honey, no...
- What?

16:03.171 --> 16:04.838
You have something on your face.

16:06.046 --> 16:07.588
Are you two...

16:08.755 --> 16:09.630
a couple?

16:09.713 --> 16:11.546
- No!
- No.

16:12.255 --> 16:13.963
20,0000! #ILoveEveryone.

16:14.046 --> 16:15.505
# BlessedAllTheWay.

16:15.588 --> 16:18.463
Because we owe it to our audience.
Right? It's super crazy.

16:18.546 --> 16:20.796
They pay you to post photos on Instagram?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.713
Of course!
And they give me free clothes.

16:22.796 --> 16:25.630
Like these.
Don't you love them? I can give you some.

16:25.713 --> 16:28.671
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't think they'll fit you.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.921
There's, like, a leak here, right?

16:31.005 --> 16:34.296
- What?
- Look at my hands. My hands got wet.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.213
- There's no pipe here...
- Oh, isn't this dishcloth a bit sticky?

16:37.296 --> 16:39.213
- Maybe...
- I'll wash it.

16:39.296 --> 16:41.588
So which of you would move in here?

16:41.796 --> 16:43.005
- Both of us.
- Both of us.

16:43.088 --> 16:45.088
Oh, honey, we said it at the same time.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.255
I'm sure a brand
could get confused one day

16:47.338 --> 16:50.046
and send me an XL or large.
I'd be happy to give it to you.

16:50.130 --> 16:52.338
You have to wash this now, or else...

16:53.171 --> 16:55.463
Watch out!

16:55.630 --> 16:57.088
Didn't you see that fly?

16:57.296 --> 16:59.671
- Is he your husband?
- No.

17:00.963 --> 17:03.880
What's this? How crazy!

17:04.171 --> 17:05.213
You're so funny.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.046
- Wait.
- Hey.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.671
There was something dead there.
Now there are living things. Name them.

17:12.963 --> 17:15.880
We'll have to use your room
so we're more comfortable.

17:15.963 --> 17:18.755
- Isn't that right, my love?
- Yes. Whatever she says.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.838
So you lived together,
but weren't married.

17:21.921 --> 17:23.546
Yeah, that's normal, right?

17:23.921 --> 17:26.755
Yes, don't worry. I'm not judging you.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.421
But God is.

17:29.046 --> 17:31.755
What is this? It's cute.

17:31.838 --> 17:36.380
The parties here have to end before 8 p.m.
I have to go to bed on time.

17:36.463 --> 17:38.046
We don't throw a lot of parties.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.505
- Hey. She stole my magnet.
- What?

17:40.588 --> 17:42.088
- She stole the magnet!
- I swear.

17:42.171 --> 17:44.005
- Tell her to give it back.
- You tell her!

17:44.296 --> 17:46.296
Okay. Well...

17:46.755 --> 17:49.671
It's fixed. You won't have any more issues
with your pipes.

17:49.755 --> 17:53.838
Thank you, Santi. That's great.
I love you. Thanks, you're the best.

17:55.046 --> 17:57.963
Why the long faces?
Was it really that bad?

17:58.671 --> 18:00.463
Yeah, looks like I'm gonna live alone.

18:00.546 --> 18:03.755
So I'll have to adopt birds
and be the crazy bird lady.

18:03.838 --> 18:06.338
Don't exaggerate,
some of the candidates were okay.

18:06.421 --> 18:09.046
- Which ones?
- The guy from the gym, for example.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.130
- The one who wanted a threesome?
- I like him.

18:12.338 --> 18:14.255
The rich girl who has a yacht.

18:14.713 --> 18:16.671
She asked what time breakfast is served.

18:16.755 --> 18:18.755
Well, Fe, what do you want me to say?

18:18.838 --> 18:21.171
Our parents are right.
Our generation is screwed.

18:21.255 --> 18:23.421
- It's social media.
- Totally.

18:23.505 --> 18:25.880
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

18:26.296 --> 18:27.130
Hello.

18:27.505 --> 18:29.380
- Hello.
- Are you María Fe?

18:29.463 --> 18:31.255
- Yes.
- You look like a María Fe.

18:31.338 --> 18:34.171
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, good.

18:34.255 --> 18:35.088
Hi.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.755
- Santiago.
- You're a Libra.

18:40.213 --> 18:42.713
This is a nice place.
It's really beautiful.

18:42.796 --> 18:45.880
Good vibes. Oh, except for this couch.

18:45.963 --> 18:47.380
Somebody cried here.

18:47.630 --> 18:48.921
That's powerful.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.796
- I'm Natalia, María Fe's best friend.
- Sorry. How are you?

18:53.213 --> 18:54.421
How are you, beautiful?

18:54.505 --> 18:56.505
- Good. And you are?
- Caro, Carolina.

18:56.588 --> 18:58.171
Caro or Carolina, either is fine.

18:58.421 --> 18:59.463
I'm a vegetarian.

18:59.546 --> 19:02.338
Sometimes I eat chicken,
but I'm a vegetarian.

19:02.505 --> 19:05.421
I do yoga every day at 7 a.m.
I wake up super early.

19:05.505 --> 19:07.463
Except Wednesdays.
They're yellow, so I can't.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.380
Of course.

19:08.463 --> 19:10.088
I don't believe
in long-term relationships.

19:10.171 --> 19:12.005
But I do believe Paul McCartney is dead

19:12.088 --> 19:15.963
and the man who passes for him
is a double. Just like Avril Lavigne.

19:18.255 --> 19:19.713
- I'm going.
- It's a...

19:19.796 --> 19:21.713
We're having a problem with the pipes,
but he'll fix it.

19:21.796 --> 19:24.463
Everything happens for a reason,
no worries.

19:24.546 --> 19:25.546
How beautiful.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.255
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:27.463 --> 19:31.213
I brought you all something to try.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.921
Thank you.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.130
- They're the best brownies in town.
- Thank you.

19:35.213 --> 19:37.088
- Did you make them?
- Yes, I made them.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.796
Don't worry, there's no pot in them.
I have pot for later if you'd like,

19:41.880 --> 19:43.588
- but that doesn't have any.
- Okay.

19:45.588 --> 19:47.755
I'm having a mouthgasm.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.671
These are definitely
the best brownies I've ever tried.

19:50.755 --> 19:53.463
That's another thing about me,
I always tell the truth.

19:54.505 --> 19:56.338
- And...
- And...

19:56.421 --> 19:59.380
Caro, when could you move in?

19:59.463 --> 20:00.296
Carolina...

20:01.338 --> 20:03.505
Everything's fine.

20:03.588 --> 20:06.755
I'm fine with moving in now.
I think you guys need help, right?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.880
You're so good at that.
Plants always die on me.

20:16.963 --> 20:19.171
- But you paint furniture beautifully.
- Thanks.

20:19.255 --> 20:22.171
This whole gardening thing
gets me very nervous.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.505
- But do you paint?
- No.

20:24.588 --> 20:26.505
I've never followed
Dr. Miyagi's practices.

20:27.546 --> 20:30.963
Mr. Miyagi.
Miyagi was a mister, not a doctor.

20:31.046 --> 20:32.921
- It's Mr. Miyagi.
- I'm sorry.

20:33.005 --> 20:33.963
Could you help us

20:34.046 --> 20:36.171
- and paint the walls?
- No.

20:36.255 --> 20:38.005
You could ask your boyfriend to help.

20:38.088 --> 20:40.255
You can relax a bit
and get off the computer.

20:40.338 --> 20:44.630
Hey, how many of these have you smoked?
Who said I have a boyfriend?

20:44.713 --> 20:48.588
Isn't the Mexican your boyfriend?
The one who curses with a Mexican accent.

20:48.671 --> 20:50.380
There's no way I'd be with him, carnal.

20:50.463 --> 20:51.921
He's a cute guy, isn't he?

20:52.005 --> 20:54.588
I mean, he's got good energy
and all that.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.963
Yeah, but don't insist.
She doesn't like those things.

20:57.046 --> 20:57.963
She's like that.

20:58.130 --> 21:01.296
He's a player.
Anyway, I think he's kind of dumb.

21:01.796 --> 21:06.171
- You liked him the first time you saw him.
- Caro, are you seeing anyone?

21:06.338 --> 21:09.963
Yeah, two or three people,
depending on the situation.

21:10.130 --> 21:13.171
I like connecting
with as many people as possible.

21:13.796 --> 21:16.463
And you? How long have you been
with your boyfriend for?

21:16.671 --> 21:20.380
No, we're not together anymore.
We lasted six years.

21:20.463 --> 21:22.880
- Oh, six years?
- Yes.

21:22.963 --> 21:26.171
That's how long a squirrel lives.
What happened?

21:26.338 --> 21:29.755
He's an architect.
He helped me fix the house up.

21:29.838 --> 21:32.838
And he went to Spain
to get his master's degree.

21:33.005 --> 21:34.796
And distance always gets in the way.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.963
But I think it's a phase,
and he'll get over it.

21:42.463 --> 21:43.505
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

21:43.588 --> 21:46.546
Let's take a selfie
so people can see we're doing things.

21:46.630 --> 21:48.380
- Great!
- Yeah.

21:49.671 --> 21:51.338
Okay. We're all happy, right?

21:55.880 --> 21:56.713
Okay.

21:56.921 --> 21:58.630
- Great, thanks.
- We're done.

21:59.296 --> 22:01.505
Be careful, this leaves a horrible stain.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
- I'm going to tag you, okay?
- Okay.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.755
TOUGH SEMESTER,
BUT WORTH THE REWARD

22:23.421 --> 22:25.588
DANIELA GARCIA
ARCHITECT AND ANIMAL LOVER

22:31.630 --> 22:36.046
THE BEST PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

22:47.255 --> 22:48.338
Thanks.

22:56.588 --> 22:58.255
Another one.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.630
Stupid!

23:01.713 --> 23:04.838
We're here with a very special guest.

23:04.921 --> 23:07.421
His name is Matías.
How are you, Matías?

23:07.505 --> 23:13.380
You're with a really, really cool girl.
And she's very beautiful.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.255
Her name is María Fe. Please, tell us...
What do you like most about her?

23:17.338 --> 23:18.296
Her ass.

23:19.088 --> 23:21.630
But tell us about better things,
qualities.

23:21.713 --> 23:24.130
My qualities as a person.

23:24.213 --> 23:26.463
You make an amazing breakfast.

23:26.546 --> 23:28.088
Scrambled eggs are my specialty.

23:28.171 --> 23:31.755
You have no idea
how she scrambles my eggs. It's delicious.

23:32.046 --> 23:33.963
Are you going to miss me a lot?

23:36.630 --> 23:38.838
- A lot.
- Yeah, you promise?

23:41.171 --> 23:43.171
I'll finish my MA
and come right back.

23:44.713 --> 23:48.963
It was at that exact moment
that I understood what I had to do.

23:49.338 --> 23:51.755
Remember how I told you
that I wanted to handle this

23:51.838 --> 23:53.005
in a mature way?

23:53.296 --> 23:55.130
That I wanted to calm down...

23:55.213 --> 23:58.671
- Yes, an admirable decision.
- No, it was really stupid.

23:58.755 --> 24:01.505
It's not right.
Who needs to be mature right now?

24:01.588 --> 24:02.880
Do you know what we need?

24:02.963 --> 24:04.546
- To sleep for eight hours.
- No.

24:04.630 --> 24:07.296
Tequila is what we need, sisters!

24:07.713 --> 24:09.380
Tequila, sisters!

24:09.671 --> 24:12.046
Stay away from me, Satan!

24:12.130 --> 24:15.130
You know you want it, grab it.
Let's do the ritual. Grab the salt.

24:15.213 --> 24:18.088
- Start thinking about your...
- Thanks, start there.

24:19.171 --> 24:21.296
- Okay, concentrate.
- Concentration.

24:21.546 --> 24:23.421
To all the women...

24:23.546 --> 24:26.088
who have made a mark on our lives.

24:27.005 --> 24:28.005
My Aunt Monique.

24:28.380 --> 24:31.838
- To Susy, my inspirational muse.
- And to La Tigresa del Oriente.

24:32.088 --> 24:34.588
- Cheers!
- No, wait.

24:35.588 --> 24:36.796
To Britney.

24:37.255 --> 24:40.088
She is overcoming all the damage
Justin did to her.

24:40.171 --> 24:43.130
You're doing good, sister. Keep at it.
We've got your back.

24:43.213 --> 24:45.213
- Cheers.
- No, wait!

24:45.463 --> 24:47.338
For that day to come...

24:47.463 --> 24:51.213
That wonderful day when we'll learn
to reproduce by ourselves,

24:51.296 --> 24:52.380
like the amoebas.

24:52.838 --> 24:54.255
- Cheers!
- Wait!

24:54.338 --> 24:55.921
I'm almost done.

24:56.005 --> 24:58.255
And for that other day to come...

24:58.338 --> 25:01.463
when we'll only need men
for the little things.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.213
Which means minimal things.

25:04.296 --> 25:06.296
For example, opening jars,

25:06.588 --> 25:08.963
reaching for things
when you don't have a step stool,

25:09.046 --> 25:11.380
killing small insects that scare us.

25:11.463 --> 25:14.296
They scare us so bad, sisters!

25:14.380 --> 25:16.463
Cheers!

25:21.755 --> 25:24.046
That's it, we're ready.

25:24.588 --> 25:27.296
Never have I ever had sex
with two best friends.

25:27.880 --> 25:28.713
Drink!

25:28.796 --> 25:32.171
Never have I ever had sex with girls
and guys

25:32.255 --> 25:34.838
and vibrators, and stuffed animals.

25:34.921 --> 25:38.046
I've never edited a nude photo
before sending it to a guy.

25:40.130 --> 25:44.630
Never have I ever...

25:44.713 --> 25:47.255
sent an email and had it bounce back.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.963
Never have I ever pooped
in someone's bathroom,

25:52.046 --> 25:53.046
had the toilet not flush,

25:53.130 --> 25:56.463
and had to grab the poop with my hand
and throw it in the trash.

25:57.796 --> 25:59.921
Drink!

26:00.005 --> 26:01.671
I never hooked up with a teacher.

26:01.755 --> 26:03.963
- I never did that!
- Yes! In the parking lot!

26:04.046 --> 26:06.421
He was my math teacher from prep school.

26:06.630 --> 26:09.171
I asked him to explain square roots.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.838
And how he took me
to the millionth power!

26:11.921 --> 26:13.130
Drink!

26:15.338 --> 26:19.796
- Does a yoga instructor count?
- Yes, it does. Cheers!

26:20.921 --> 26:22.921
You know what we should do? Dance.

26:23.005 --> 26:24.671
Yes, where should we go?

26:28.005 --> 26:30.588
There was this one place.
Isn't there a place close by...

26:30.671 --> 26:32.296
Was it Teatriz?

26:32.380 --> 26:35.630
- It was over here...
- I think it was Zoom.

26:35.713 --> 26:38.463
I'll just type in "Barranco."
And we'll look around there.

26:39.671 --> 26:42.838
Where are all my people
from the Bridge of Sighs?

27:08.630 --> 27:09.713
What's up?

27:12.171 --> 27:13.213
No!

27:20.338 --> 27:21.463
Idiot!

27:24.838 --> 27:28.213
Who knows how to party better,
men or women?

27:28.296 --> 27:30.255
- Women!
- Women!

27:40.088 --> 27:42.921
# HOWYOUTHINKYOULOOK

27:43.005 --> 27:47.546
# HOWYOUREALLYLOOK

28:13.171 --> 28:14.421
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.171
- Sir.
- Sir, please.

28:19.255 --> 28:20.838
I'd like the same drink.

28:21.421 --> 28:23.921
- Just what we need.
- Can we have that?

28:24.005 --> 28:26.963
Excuse me. Go take care of your kids.

28:27.213 --> 28:30.130
"Go take care of your kids"?

28:30.380 --> 28:32.463
- That was so disrespectful.
- That was too much.

28:32.546 --> 28:34.130
I'm getting a chilcano cocktail.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.255
No, you know what pisco does to you.
No way...

28:37.338 --> 28:38.296
- Rum?
- No.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.213
- Vodka?
- No, get some water.

28:40.296 --> 28:41.671
- Come on.
- No.

28:41.755 --> 28:43.005
I'll be right back.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.588
Oh, we lost her.

28:45.671 --> 28:47.421
It sucks that it's daytime in China.

28:47.505 --> 28:49.296
- I have to get this.
- Are you serious?

28:49.380 --> 28:52.546
Stay here, don't move. I'll be back.
I need to play sober.

29:05.546 --> 29:07.505
Remember when we danced to this song?

29:08.505 --> 29:11.046
Sir, a pisco, please.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.796
- Chilcano?
- No, a shot!

29:13.338 --> 29:15.171
You know that's going to be bad for you.

29:30.796 --> 29:33.630
María Fe? María Fe, are you there?

29:35.838 --> 29:37.338
Hey, don't cut the line!

29:37.421 --> 29:39.921
- Don't cut the line!
- Don't cut the line!

29:40.380 --> 29:42.630
My best friend is
in that bathroom calling her ex.

29:42.713 --> 29:43.796
Go ahead.

29:44.255 --> 29:45.505
María Fe?

29:45.838 --> 29:47.963
- I'm sorry. María Fe?
- Fe!

29:50.380 --> 29:52.046
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

29:52.630 --> 29:54.046
María Fe, drop that phone.

29:54.755 --> 29:55.838
Fe, don't text him.

29:55.921 --> 29:58.796
- Give us the phone.
- You'll regret this tomorrow.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.296
When you're sober, you'll regret this.

30:01.380 --> 30:05.630
Tequila: six. Whiskey: two. Pisco: one.

30:05.713 --> 30:10.213
Calls to your ex: one. Dignity: zero.

30:28.963 --> 30:30.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:30.546 --> 30:32.130
Did the tequila help?

30:32.796 --> 30:33.630
Here you go.

30:35.755 --> 30:38.130
It has no sugar.
I sweetened it with dates.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.963
Those are coconut flakes on top.
No flour, either.

30:41.046 --> 30:43.380
There's nothing in it.
I mean, it has other things.

30:43.463 --> 30:44.921
- Thanks.
- Help yourself.

30:49.838 --> 30:50.880
It's delicious.

30:50.963 --> 30:53.838
I know it doesn't seem like it, but...

30:54.921 --> 30:57.546
I also know what it's like
to have a broken heart.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.463
Let me guess, a guy?

30:59.546 --> 31:01.630
It doesn't necessarily
have to be a guy, right?

31:04.546 --> 31:06.505
When I was 19...

31:08.755 --> 31:10.838
I had to go back to my mom's house.

31:11.880 --> 31:16.505
I lost my job and had to go back
to my mom's house.

31:16.796 --> 31:19.713
And she was married to an idiot.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.963
To a disgusting drunk.

31:24.838 --> 31:27.755
And one day, I was asleep...

31:29.338 --> 31:31.755
and he came home drunk, as usual.

31:33.755 --> 31:34.880
And he got into my bed.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.338
No, I'm fine. Nothing happened to me.

31:40.213 --> 31:41.380
What I mean is...

31:43.296 --> 31:47.213
That's not what matters. What matters is
that I went to tell my mom, and...

31:48.005 --> 31:49.588
and she didn't believe me.

31:52.630 --> 31:54.255
So I left.

31:56.796 --> 31:59.838
- I feel silly now crying over a man.
- Don't worry.

32:00.255 --> 32:03.088
All sadness hurts, right?
It's just a different hurt.

32:03.505 --> 32:06.921
Your six-year relationship ended
over Skype.

32:07.005 --> 32:10.671
It sucks, but it'll pass. You'll be fine.

32:10.755 --> 32:14.963
I think that, right now, you should focus
your energy on something else.

32:16.755 --> 32:20.005
When this happened to me,
I started doing yoga.

32:20.088 --> 32:22.338
- The yoga was awesome.
- Yeah.

32:24.963 --> 32:28.630
Einstein said
that life is like riding a bicycle.

32:29.296 --> 32:32.588
To keep your balance,
you need to keep moving forward.

32:32.671 --> 32:35.505
- That's it!
- Yep.

32:35.630 --> 32:38.796
So, should I ride a bicycle or do yoga?

32:39.046 --> 32:40.380
No, do pole dancing.

32:40.463 --> 32:41.671
- Pole dancing?
- Yeah.

32:41.963 --> 32:45.546
Let's start with a beautiful move,
the witch.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.296
We have to think about it,
have it clear in our minds.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.963
We visualize it in...

32:50.046 --> 32:53.421
three... two... one.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.963
And we have the witch. That's it.

32:56.463 --> 32:59.796
That's it. We hold our beautiful witch.

32:59.880 --> 33:04.463
Hold that pelvis, keep your smile.
And now, the angel.

33:05.546 --> 33:08.796
If we can't remember how to do it,
we can look at the advanced students.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.755
Yes, good.

33:11.171 --> 33:12.880
That's it.

33:13.755 --> 33:16.463
One... and dolphin. That's it.

33:16.546 --> 33:19.505
Feet together, with a princess smile.

33:19.671 --> 33:23.505
And exponential self-love.

33:23.588 --> 33:26.921
That's it, beautiful. Let's keep trying.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.755
- I got it!
- Yes, there you go.

33:29.838 --> 33:32.671
We hold it for ten... nine...

33:32.755 --> 33:35.963
eight... seven... and smile...

33:36.213 --> 33:37.421
That's it.

33:39.213 --> 33:42.421
Chess player, that's my thing.

33:42.505 --> 33:45.505
The queen
is the most important piece here.

33:45.588 --> 33:48.755
And the only one that can move
wherever she wants to.

33:48.838 --> 33:49.671
How about that?

33:50.588 --> 33:53.088
For you, the Beyoncé of chess.

33:53.255 --> 33:55.505
There are few games
in which I've learned as much

33:55.588 --> 33:57.838
as I have from most of my mistakes.

34:03.421 --> 34:06.796
Well, of course my queen was captured
by a pawn!

34:06.921 --> 34:08.130
So typical...

34:12.630 --> 34:16.255
This is wonderful and addictive junk.
I don't get why you don't sell them.

34:16.338 --> 34:18.130
It's not junk, and it's not addictive.

34:18.213 --> 34:20.713
It has coconut milk,
and it's healthy, so help yourself.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.338
I'm sorry, but you'd be a millionaire.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.505
Thanks, I'll pass.
I'd rather cook for you.

34:25.588 --> 34:26.545
With love. That's it.

34:26.630 --> 34:30.670
I want to see Matías's face
when he sees that I-by-myself.com

34:30.755 --> 34:32.420
fixed that cabinet door.

34:32.838 --> 34:36.088
My God, how much longer
do I have to hear that name?

34:36.670 --> 34:38.005
Fine, I'm sorry.

34:38.463 --> 34:40.463
- Want some?
- Thanks.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.880
You should keep yourself busy
with something else.

34:42.963 --> 34:44.795
For your own good and for ours.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.630
Carolina, defend me.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.338
I'm keeping myself busy.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.505
- Really?
- Yes. I'm doing a bunch of things.

34:51.588 --> 34:53.295
- Like what?
- I colored mandalas,

34:53.380 --> 34:55.963
I painted the walls,
I just fixed that cabinet.

34:56.045 --> 34:58.005
What else did I do? I played chess.

34:58.088 --> 35:01.046
- Wow.
- I read Don Quijote again.

35:01.130 --> 35:02.255
I tried pole dancing.

35:02.338 --> 35:04.588
Oh, please, tell me how that went.

35:05.546 --> 35:07.380
Humiliation is not the best therapy.

35:07.463 --> 35:09.755
She did well.
She just has to keep practicing.

35:09.838 --> 35:10.671
Thanks.

35:10.755 --> 35:13.671
Usually, you're a smart slacker,
but now, you're just a slacker.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.421
Keep insulting me, please.
You empower me.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.505
I'm not insulting you.

35:17.588 --> 35:19.421
I'm making a dessert. I'm inventing it.

35:19.505 --> 35:20.921
- Should I continue?
- Please.

35:21.005 --> 35:23.546
Fine, I'm insulting you.
Hearing you makes me grumpy.

35:23.630 --> 35:25.088
- Sorry.
- Thanks. Please continue.

35:25.171 --> 35:27.546
You have to stop, Fe. I'm serious.

35:27.630 --> 35:29.255
- Enough.
- What's your problem?

35:29.755 --> 35:33.713
You're not a kid anymore.
We're adults now. Life is passing by.

35:34.505 --> 35:36.588
When will you do
what you've always wanted to?

35:36.671 --> 35:38.630
You know what I want? I don't. Tell me.

35:40.505 --> 35:41.338
What?

35:41.421 --> 35:44.713
When did you decide to spend your life
writing commercials? I don't get it.

35:44.963 --> 35:47.338
- Are you making fun of my job?
- No!

35:47.796 --> 35:50.421
In high school, you wanted to be a writer.

35:50.505 --> 35:52.338
She was the only one who knew
what she wanted to do.

35:52.421 --> 35:54.171
I had no idea, but she did.

35:54.255 --> 35:56.338
And she won at everything.

35:57.213 --> 35:59.671
Now you say
you don't know what to do with your life.

35:59.755 --> 36:02.046
- I don't.
- You say you're sad, you're going to die.

36:02.463 --> 36:04.255
You want to play chess...

36:04.338 --> 36:06.588
All because that dwarf left you.
You can't be serious.

36:06.671 --> 36:10.046
I don't know what to write about, Natalia.
I don't know where to start.

36:10.130 --> 36:12.755
Well, start by sitting
in front of a computer.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.130
Like this,
because things won't write themselves.

36:15.213 --> 36:18.046
So, I just sit at the computer,
and a masterpiece will happen.

36:18.130 --> 36:22.046
You always said you wanted a blog.
Where's the blog? Huh?

36:22.963 --> 36:25.630
- Blogs aren't even trendy anymore.
- Of course they are.

36:25.713 --> 36:28.796
- So write one, for fuck's sake!
- I don't know what to write about.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.463
- I don't know.
- Of course you do!

36:30.546 --> 36:33.171
I don't know! I swear, I have no idea.

36:33.255 --> 36:36.671
The only thing I have in my head
is that unnamable insect.

36:36.755 --> 36:40.296
And how I want his intestines to rot
and pus to come out of them.

36:40.380 --> 36:43.046
And for him to have to call me
to take care of him

36:43.130 --> 36:47.296
and make him hot chamomile tea
so he can sleep well.

36:47.380 --> 36:51.796
After that, I feel bad
and I lose all my dignity

36:51.880 --> 36:53.880
for wanting something bad
to happen to him.

36:53.963 --> 36:57.046
I wanted him so much,
I loved him so much.

36:57.130 --> 36:58.171
And then I feel worse

36:58.255 --> 37:01.338
because I'm the protagonist
of a shitty comedy.

37:01.421 --> 37:02.963
Where God and the Devil,

37:03.046 --> 37:07.546
and all the people or beings
in charge of making me feel bad

37:07.630 --> 37:10.171
spit at me with their black humor
and make fun of me.

37:10.255 --> 37:12.463
And you can handle all of these things.

37:12.546 --> 37:14.213
You have this wall around you

37:14.296 --> 37:17.588
that won't let you feel anything.
But I'm going to end up alone.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.546
And I'll go crazy.

37:21.963 --> 37:25.171
I'll end up crying
in the street somewhere.

37:29.796 --> 37:33.130
If you see me in the street crying,
please pick me up.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.671
At least do that.

37:38.088 --> 37:41.505
If all of that was in a blog,
I'd definitely read it.

38:16.130 --> 38:20.213
WRITE A NAME
CREATE BLOG

38:23.630 --> 38:28.630
Have you ever gone out
with one of those insecure idiots

38:28.713 --> 38:30.838
who aren't acrylic or oil paint?

38:30.921 --> 38:35.630
Well then, you've had the pleasure
of meeting a watercolor.

38:35.713 --> 38:39.505
This kind of man requires a lot of work.

38:39.588 --> 38:42.588
The cup with water, the paintbrush,

38:42.671 --> 38:46.671
and in the end,
it's not even decent paint.

38:52.213 --> 38:54.130
"Sex and Ceviche."

38:55.630 --> 38:57.921
I don't know
if that's genius or disgusting.

38:58.005 --> 39:01.005
No.

39:03.421 --> 39:05.713
"A Crisis of Fe."

39:06.588 --> 39:08.463
That sounds
like a Christian channel show.

39:08.546 --> 39:10.421
No.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.796
HOLLYWOOD'S NEWEST
AND MOST DESIRED BACHELORETTE

39:19.796 --> 39:22.255
"Soltera Codiciada."

39:22.338 --> 39:26.630
No, I'm not available. I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you.

39:33.255 --> 39:35.130
How's that presentation going, beautiful?

39:36.130 --> 39:37.505
Very good. Good.

39:38.505 --> 39:40.796
Don't forget,
I want a presentation like...

39:47.130 --> 39:49.921
- I hate him. I don't get it.
- Me neither.

39:50.005 --> 39:52.213
He talks like he's Argentinian,
then Peruvian.

39:52.296 --> 39:54.380
- He sucks.
- Totally.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.880
I really don't like him.

39:56.963 --> 39:58.838
What is it, Natalia? I'm working.

39:58.921 --> 40:01.838
Excuse me,
am I speaking to Soltera Codiciada?

40:02.046 --> 40:02.880
How do you know?

40:02.963 --> 40:04.755
First, because you write how you speak.

40:04.838 --> 40:09.296
Second, because the watercolor idea
came up when I broke up with stupid Nico.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.755
And third, because it's all over Facebook.

40:11.838 --> 40:13.588
What are you talking about?

40:13.880 --> 40:16.046
Wait, I'm going to look.
I'll call you back.

40:17.088 --> 40:20.005
Friends, I need to tell you something.

40:20.088 --> 40:21.671
I started a blog.

40:21.755 --> 40:22.630
- What?
- A blog?

40:22.713 --> 40:24.380
Yes, "Soltera Codiciada."

40:24.463 --> 40:25.713
What are you saying?

40:25.796 --> 40:28.463
Wait. Apparently I have...

40:28.546 --> 40:32.171
What? My blog has 300 views!

40:33.130 --> 40:36.463
I don't even have 300 friends!

40:36.546 --> 40:38.296
Sorry. I don't even have 30.

40:38.380 --> 40:41.046
I might not even have three,
but I have you two.

40:41.130 --> 40:45.421
- Oh, my friends!
- What's going on? Is this a market?

40:46.046 --> 40:49.213
Do you want your paychecks or not?
Let's get to work.

40:52.505 --> 40:54.338
- Share it with me.
- I want to share it.

40:55.588 --> 40:58.463
"I think I've only been
with crayons in my life."

40:58.838 --> 41:01.088
"I love you, Soltera." I love you, too.

41:01.171 --> 41:05.213
"You should talk
about the guys you meet on Tinder."

41:07.546 --> 41:09.796
Well, first,
you need another profile picture.

41:09.880 --> 41:10.963
This one's horrible.

41:11.046 --> 41:14.880
What's wrong with you? This one is fine.
I look fun.

41:14.963 --> 41:17.630
Tinder is not a place for fun people,
María Fe.

41:17.713 --> 41:19.630
- No?
- That's what Twitter is for.

41:19.713 --> 41:22.338
Tinder is a place for people to have sex.

41:22.421 --> 41:24.213
- It's sexual.
- Oh, that's gross.

41:24.296 --> 41:25.463
- Come here.
- Okay.

41:26.296 --> 41:29.296
I'd suggest you change it to...

41:30.005 --> 41:32.963
- My God.
- Don't make fun of me.

41:33.505 --> 41:34.713
- This one.
- Don't look.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.296
- Don't look at it.
- It's perfect.

41:36.380 --> 41:39.671
Listen, it's from three years ago.
I'm dressed as a sexy nurse, no.

41:39.755 --> 41:42.296
That's what we want.
You should look sexy.

41:42.380 --> 41:44.505
- This is the one. Do you trust me?
- Okay. Yes.

41:44.588 --> 41:47.546
- Okay.
- Okay, let's see. Look at our options.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.588
- That one with the beard!
- He's gay.

41:49.671 --> 41:51.088
Really? Okay.

41:51.171 --> 41:53.255
This one. Oh, I super liked him!

41:53.338 --> 41:55.088
What will happen?
Will he know my address?

41:55.171 --> 41:56.213
It's okay.

41:57.213 --> 41:59.005
- Relax a bit.
- I'm relaxed.

41:59.088 --> 42:01.755
- Relax more.
- It's for research.

42:01.838 --> 42:04.963
It's normal,
I'm just getting to know the app.

42:05.046 --> 42:07.338
Another one. That one, Fernando!

42:07.421 --> 42:08.671
No? Which one is Fernando?

42:08.755 --> 42:11.338
If it's a group photo,
it's always the ugliest one.

42:14.838 --> 42:15.921
- This one, right?
- Him?

42:16.005 --> 42:17.671
- Sure. Let's see.
- Okay.

42:17.755 --> 42:22.046
- Look him up.
- Lorenzo, 27 years old. He's a surfer.

42:22.880 --> 42:26.005
- He doesn't look like a psychopath.
- No, he won't hurt me too much.

42:26.088 --> 42:27.796
- No.
- Okay.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.380
- It's a match!
- Chat with him and have fun.

42:32.463 --> 42:34.171
Okay, and what should I write?

42:34.380 --> 42:37.463
I usually go right to the photo.

42:37.546 --> 42:38.463
- A photo?
- Yes.

42:38.546 --> 42:41.130
- A selfie.
- A selfie?

42:41.213 --> 42:44.338
- Naked?
- Step by step.

42:44.421 --> 42:46.171
Let's say you start with your face.

42:46.255 --> 42:48.588
- The face?
- Then the neck.

42:48.671 --> 42:50.005
Then you keep going down.

42:50.421 --> 42:52.921
That's so kinky!

42:53.005 --> 42:55.921
- It works for me.
- Don't be like that!

42:56.671 --> 43:00.046
Being single is an eternal search
for the...

43:00.671 --> 43:02.213
the perfect balance.

43:05.755 --> 43:11.505
Shaving just in case it happens.
Or not shaving so it doesn't happen.

43:13.880 --> 43:17.255
Putting enough makeup on to look great.

43:17.338 --> 43:20.546
But not enough to make it look
like you tried too hard.

43:21.338 --> 43:22.421
Thank you.

43:23.921 --> 43:26.421
You're so sweet. No...

43:26.713 --> 43:30.338
I had no time to dress up.
I'm just so busy. But thank you.

43:33.421 --> 43:37.088
And above all, look like
you have everything under control.

43:37.171 --> 43:41.046
Even though you have no idea
what you're doing.

43:41.130 --> 43:42.255
# CANDYMODE

43:43.463 --> 43:46.630
# HIPSTERMODE

43:47.755 --> 43:50.421
# DESPERATEMODE

43:55.421 --> 43:56.505
Lorenzo?

43:57.296 --> 44:00.046
How are you? Hi.
I didn't recognize you.

44:00.421 --> 44:03.213
You look different in your profile photo.

44:03.296 --> 44:05.838
Yes, it was my best photo and my best age.

44:06.171 --> 44:08.005
- María José.
- María Fe.

44:08.088 --> 44:10.505
Sorry, I confuse those Christian names.

44:10.588 --> 44:12.671
María José, María Fe, Magdalena...

44:13.213 --> 44:15.421
- I got you a caramel macchiato.
- Thanks.

44:15.505 --> 44:17.796
My female friends love it,
so I got you one.

44:17.880 --> 44:18.963
Caramel macchiato?

44:19.755 --> 44:22.046
Once, I put milk in your coffee.
You almost killed me.

44:22.630 --> 44:23.671
He doesn't know.

44:23.921 --> 44:25.546
- I don't know what?
- Oh.

44:25.921 --> 44:27.588
- I don't know what?
- No...

44:27.671 --> 44:31.005
I was saying I don't know
what kind of work you do.

44:31.088 --> 44:36.630
But now I remember your profile photo,
and it looked like you enjoy surfing.

44:36.713 --> 44:39.213
That's so great! It's so cool.

44:39.296 --> 44:41.046
I'd love to go surfing one day.

44:41.130 --> 44:43.713
It's amazing.
I loved it the one time I did it.

44:46.380 --> 44:47.671
You don't do it all the time?

44:47.755 --> 44:50.171
No, you have to wake up at 5 a.m.,

44:50.255 --> 44:52.380
buy your own board,
and know how to swim.

44:54.296 --> 44:56.880
- Well, you're not a nurse either, are you?
- Shut up.

44:57.171 --> 45:00.671
- Should I shut up?
- No, not you. What I meant is that...

45:00.755 --> 45:03.546
If you don't like surfing,
what do you like doing?

45:03.630 --> 45:06.005
- What do you do?
- I'm working on an app with a friend.

45:06.213 --> 45:08.130
Cool, and what's the name?

45:08.213 --> 45:11.255
That doesn't matter, she's a know-it-all.
She's annoying and fat.

45:13.880 --> 45:16.630
I was asking about the app's name.

45:19.588 --> 45:21.296
- Tostadapp.
- Tostadapp?

45:21.380 --> 45:22.505
Yes, "Tostada App."

45:22.588 --> 45:25.421
- They share the a. It's "Tostadapp."
- Tostadapp.

45:26.630 --> 45:27.838
What's Tostadapp about?

45:27.921 --> 45:29.671
It's an app you can download
for free.

45:29.755 --> 45:31.921
You have three options
to put on your tostada.

45:32.005 --> 45:33.463
Butter, jam, and honey.

45:34.046 --> 45:36.546
You must be thinking
that it makes no sense.

45:36.630 --> 45:38.421
I was wondering if it's a joke or not.

45:38.505 --> 45:41.338
The money comes later.
You get hooked on the app,

45:41.671 --> 45:43.921
you can buy another upgrade,
but it costs $20.

45:44.005 --> 45:47.130
Then, you have whatever you want.
Avocado, ham, cheese, turmeric...

45:47.213 --> 45:50.588
And if you're really hooked,
then you can add...

45:51.588 --> 45:53.755
Do you like muscle relaxants?

45:54.005 --> 45:55.630
No, I'm allergic.

45:55.713 --> 45:58.796
Are you serious?
You want to forget me with this idiot?

46:03.630 --> 46:07.171
BALANCE

46:12.463 --> 46:15.130
Yes, you haven't forgotten him.

46:15.213 --> 46:16.963
And in this exact moment,

46:17.046 --> 46:21.671
you have this overwhelming feeling
that you won't be able to.

46:22.005 --> 46:25.213
You know he's a poor idiot
and you shouldn't miss him.

46:25.296 --> 46:26.546
But you do miss him,

46:26.630 --> 46:29.755
and that makes you feel
like a poor idiot.

46:29.838 --> 46:34.213
And, damn it, your friends told you
it was a matter of time.

46:34.296 --> 46:38.213
So why the hell does it hurt
as if it happened yesterday?

47:04.713 --> 47:05.671
Oh, shit!

47:06.296 --> 47:08.213
How was your Tinder date?

47:08.421 --> 47:10.255
- Tostadapp.
- What's that?

47:10.338 --> 47:13.713
It's a long story. Too long.

47:14.505 --> 47:17.921
- Know who's getting married?
- Who? Besides everyone on my Facebook...

47:18.796 --> 47:20.755
What an ugly envelope. Let me see.

47:22.671 --> 47:25.296
Oh, Laura Rivas. It was obvious.

47:25.546 --> 47:29.046
- Are you okay with this news?
- I'm fine. Why should this get to me?

47:29.130 --> 47:31.546
- You've always been jealous of her.
- Don't exaggerate.

47:32.296 --> 47:33.838
You cried in a bathroom for three hours

47:33.921 --> 47:36.546
when they gave her the graduation speech
instead of you.

47:36.755 --> 47:38.546
We were just kids. I'm fine now.

47:38.630 --> 47:41.171
While she's picking out tablecloths
and changing diapers,

47:41.255 --> 47:44.255
I'll be picking investment funds
and negotiating with China.

47:44.463 --> 47:48.963
It's obvious who made better use
of the last five years in economics.

47:49.046 --> 47:51.755
Someone has to practice
their radical forgiveness.

47:51.838 --> 47:54.088
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

47:54.171 --> 47:56.171
- There's one for you, too.
- Let me see.

47:58.588 --> 47:59.588
María Fe and Matías.

47:59.671 --> 48:02.671
Oh, it's just a small detail.
You're going, right?

48:03.338 --> 48:06.296
I'll go. It's against my religion
to pass up a table of chocolate.

48:06.380 --> 48:09.255
- I'm proud of you! Amen to that.
- Hallelujah.

48:11.421 --> 48:13.130
Your life is a wardrobe.

48:13.213 --> 48:16.088
And it doesn't matter
how badly you want to buy clothes.

48:16.171 --> 48:18.630
If you don't get rid of your old,
ugly clothes

48:18.713 --> 48:22.838
that drain your energy,
you'll never have space for the new ones.

48:42.921 --> 48:46.338
Get out of there! Go home!

48:50.088 --> 48:54.255
I'm not exactly sure how to finish it,
but I think this is the right direction.

48:54.338 --> 48:57.005
Simplicity will help to tell the story.

48:58.380 --> 49:03.255
I don't want to discourage you, but...
I feel that your idea lacks emotion.

49:03.338 --> 49:05.630
It's missing that boom. Do you understand?

49:05.713 --> 49:07.213
- Of course.
- Think bigger.

49:07.296 --> 49:10.796
I understand, it could be more...
attention-grabbing.

49:10.880 --> 49:14.755
But because it's such a personal subject,
Ramiro, I think that less is more.

49:14.838 --> 49:16.463
In advertising, there's no such thing.

49:16.546 --> 49:18.380
- "Less is more" doesn't exist.
- It doesn't exist.

49:18.546 --> 49:20.630
Don't repeat everything I say, Mini-Me.

49:20.713 --> 49:24.505
Less is more doesn't exist in advertising.
I'm going to tell you a story.

49:25.588 --> 49:29.421
It was the year 1998, I had just returned
from studying in Buenos Aires.

49:29.505 --> 49:34.838
They offered me the launch
of Virú Paints in all of Peru.

49:34.921 --> 49:38.005
Seven supermodels,
the biggest at that time.

49:38.088 --> 49:40.755
Beautiful girls, all painted in colors...

49:41.421 --> 49:43.713
San Martín Square... Lights...

49:44.505 --> 49:46.171
Virú.

49:48.213 --> 49:49.671
It was shown everywhere.

49:50.880 --> 49:55.630
So you need me to use blonde models,
wearing high heels...

49:55.713 --> 49:58.921
Not models, I want something powerful.

50:01.296 --> 50:02.130
Do you understand?

50:03.796 --> 50:05.171
Anyone want to add anything?

50:05.255 --> 50:09.171
That's what I get for showing something
with sensitivity

50:09.255 --> 50:12.588
to my idiot, caveman, creep of a boss.

50:12.671 --> 50:15.880
I hate him with all my heart.
I hate men...

50:15.963 --> 50:18.421
No, you're not allowed
to kill yourself in my office.

50:18.505 --> 50:20.755
I wasn't going to kill myself.
It's just a joke.

50:21.213 --> 50:22.921
Hey, at least you don't hate me.

50:23.171 --> 50:25.463
- Because we haven't had sex.
- Good for us.

50:27.796 --> 50:30.588
By the way, there's a party
with everyone from the office.

50:30.671 --> 50:33.130
Maybe it could give you ideas
for "Soltera Codiciada"?

50:33.213 --> 50:34.171
Let's go.

50:34.255 --> 50:35.671
You can invite your friend.

50:35.838 --> 50:38.296
- Which friend?
- Your only friend.

50:40.421 --> 50:43.171
Very funny. Fine, I'll tell Natalia.

50:43.255 --> 50:45.213
But she'll ignore you.
You're not her type.

50:45.296 --> 50:46.921
You'll never be her type.

50:47.005 --> 50:49.880
Hey, I'm the universal type,
just so you know.

50:57.963 --> 51:00.046
- He said we should wait by the bar.
- Where?

51:00.130 --> 51:01.921
- Was that a good entrance?
- On fire.

51:02.005 --> 51:03.921
- Really?
- There he is.

51:04.005 --> 51:08.005
- I saw him.
- What a nice guy.

51:08.088 --> 51:10.588
- Two cosmopolitans for the ladies.
- Thank you.

51:10.671 --> 51:15.005
So, since we're women,
we should like Barbie drinks.

51:15.088 --> 51:17.213
I like this drink.
Do you want something else?

51:17.296 --> 51:18.630
- What are you having?
- Whiskey.

51:18.713 --> 51:19.963
I want the same.

51:20.255 --> 51:21.838
I'm fine, thanks.

51:22.963 --> 51:24.088
- What's wrong?
- What?

51:24.171 --> 51:27.713
- You love girly drinks.
- Let me have some fun.

51:27.838 --> 51:31.796
I don't get why you're so mean to him.
He's the nicest heterosexual man I know.

51:31.880 --> 51:34.046
I'm not being mean.
This is how we treat each other.

51:34.130 --> 51:35.713
I don't know, we like it.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.046
Hey, isn't that Carolina?

51:40.130 --> 51:41.171
- Where?
- Over there.

51:45.630 --> 51:47.088
- How are you?
- Hey! I'm great.

51:47.171 --> 51:50.380
- How long have you worked here?
- I just started. Check this out.

51:53.005 --> 51:55.130
Santiago is calling us. Come on, let's go.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.255
- Be back soon.
- Okay.

51:57.005 --> 51:59.755
Wait. That guy is looking at you.

51:59.838 --> 52:01.088
- He is?
- Yes.

52:01.171 --> 52:03.796
- He's not.
- He's still looking.

52:03.880 --> 52:07.005
- What should I do?
- Keep walking.

52:08.796 --> 52:10.546
She's got a fan.

52:11.338 --> 52:14.171
- Yes!
- Yes!

52:14.255 --> 52:15.880
Come on, get over there.

52:15.963 --> 52:20.255
No, I don't know how to flirt anymore.
I'm serious, I don't remember how to.

52:20.338 --> 52:22.671
Why don't you try the lonely technique?

52:23.546 --> 52:24.546
What is that?

52:24.713 --> 52:27.255
Oh, come on.
It's when a woman is alone on purpose,

52:27.338 --> 52:29.671
and she makes this face
like she'd love to talk.

52:30.088 --> 52:31.713
- And what comes next?
- Yeah.

52:31.796 --> 52:34.421
You kiss him! Men like that.

52:34.505 --> 52:38.005
If the conversation doesn't flow,
you kiss him, and that's it.

52:38.088 --> 52:40.171
You can't talk
if you're using your tongue.

52:40.255 --> 52:42.046
Oh, don't be a caveman.

52:42.755 --> 52:46.588
You should use the trick
where you ask to try his drink.

52:46.671 --> 52:49.755
You go towards him, and say,
"Can I try your drink?"

52:49.921 --> 52:52.088
But instead of grabbing the drink,
you kiss him

52:52.171 --> 52:54.255
and say, "It's delicious."

52:56.171 --> 52:57.505
I'll do both.

52:57.588 --> 52:58.421
- Okay.
- Go.

52:58.505 --> 53:00.713
- It'll work.
- I'm going.

53:00.796 --> 53:02.880
- You can do this.
- Let's go.

53:03.338 --> 53:06.380
What happened? They left.

53:06.963 --> 53:08.630
Do you think it'll work?

53:09.421 --> 53:12.505
I know him. He's my friend.
I told him to go over.

53:12.588 --> 53:14.338
Nice one!

53:14.421 --> 53:17.505
Hopefully she'll stop talking
about Matías for a while.

53:20.463 --> 53:22.838
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

53:22.921 --> 53:23.921
Good, and you?

53:24.921 --> 53:27.963
- I'm all right.
- Just all right? Because you look great.

53:28.046 --> 53:29.088
Thanks.

53:29.505 --> 53:33.588
My friends just left me here.
I mean...

53:33.671 --> 53:36.380
- Isn't it better this way?
- It is, right?

53:36.463 --> 53:37.296
Of course.

53:37.713 --> 53:42.880
- Yeah, but my drink is... gross.
- Do you want me to buy you a drink?

53:42.963 --> 53:46.463
No, I meant to ask...
Can I try your drink?

53:46.546 --> 53:47.755
Yes, of course.

53:54.838 --> 53:57.421
- Cheers to our friend!
- Cheers to her.

53:57.505 --> 53:58.671
Good for you, María Fe.

54:00.546 --> 54:01.963
Can I try your drink?

54:05.880 --> 54:06.796
No.

54:13.755 --> 54:15.421
It's delicious.

54:15.755 --> 54:19.296
- You mean the kiss?
- Both.

54:19.380 --> 54:21.796
But you haven't tried the drink. Try it.

54:28.171 --> 54:32.171
- Well, this is my house. The kitchen's...
- Nice place.

54:35.546 --> 54:36.796
Wait a second.

54:40.421 --> 54:43.963
- Upstairs.
- Hurry up.

54:49.505 --> 54:53.171
Holy Christ! Oh, God!

54:57.296 --> 54:59.296
SLACKER

55:12.630 --> 55:16.255
INCOMING CALL
LOVEBUG

55:16.505 --> 55:17.380
Hello.

55:18.921 --> 55:20.338
Hello? Fe?

55:21.755 --> 55:22.963
Matías?

55:25.088 --> 55:27.921
- How are you?
- Um...

55:28.505 --> 55:30.380
I'm fine. Well, I was sleeping,

55:30.463 --> 55:32.921
but now I'm wondering
why you called me.

55:33.838 --> 55:36.880
Listen... I was thinking about you.

55:37.338 --> 55:40.088
And I just called to see
how you're doing.

55:40.171 --> 55:42.671
When your ex... Yes, your ex...

55:42.755 --> 55:45.921
With e for egotistical, for evasive...

55:46.005 --> 55:47.046
for small dick...

55:47.130 --> 55:49.588
Okay, that doesn't start with e,
but good point.

55:49.671 --> 55:53.546
...calls you in the middle of the night
to tell you that he misses you,

55:53.630 --> 55:56.546
such a crappy gesture
deserves only one response.

55:56.755 --> 56:00.046
Look, I have good news and bad news.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.880
The good news is
that I know what I want.

56:04.796 --> 56:07.296
And the bad news is
that sure as hell isn't you.

56:07.380 --> 56:09.255
So if you feel like chatting,

56:09.338 --> 56:11.921
call your psychologist,
your 16 booty calls,

56:12.005 --> 56:15.338
or your mother, because I'm not available,
buddy.

56:15.421 --> 56:16.755
As the saying goes,

56:17.046 --> 56:20.296
"I sold my sack,
so I didn't have to carry it."

56:21.171 --> 56:25.671
Unfortunately, it's always harder
to do it than to say it.

56:25.755 --> 56:29.005
Fe? Are you not going to say anything?

56:29.713 --> 56:30.630
I...

56:32.380 --> 56:33.880
I don't know what to tell you.

56:33.963 --> 56:37.296
Things are the way they are
because of you.

56:37.921 --> 56:40.546
What do you want? What's going on?

56:40.630 --> 56:43.713
I know. But something funny happened
to me today,

56:43.796 --> 56:45.338
and I wanted to tell you,

56:45.588 --> 56:49.630
but I realized we don't talk anymore.
I don't like things to be this way.

56:50.005 --> 56:51.630
You were my best friend.

56:54.421 --> 56:55.505
And you were mine.

56:57.255 --> 57:02.630
Come on, stupid woman. Hang up.
Come on, you can do it. Hang up!

57:04.338 --> 57:05.505
And...

57:07.005 --> 57:10.088
What happened
to make you want to call me?

57:11.463 --> 57:12.880
Brain-dead.

57:37.421 --> 57:39.921
REST UP, BEAUTIFUL.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

57:40.005 --> 57:42.213
TALK TO YOU TOMORROW

57:46.755 --> 57:48.088
HI, LOVEBUG!

58:01.880 --> 58:03.921
IT WAS GREAT TO TALK LAST NIGHT

58:15.963 --> 58:17.713
- Hey!
- Hey!

58:17.796 --> 58:19.130
I have to go.

58:19.213 --> 58:21.713
I have a work meeting,
but I can't find my sock.

58:21.796 --> 58:25.755
Oh, it's somewhere here.
They always hide around here.

58:25.838 --> 58:29.421
- Here it is. Here you go.
- Thank you.

58:29.505 --> 58:31.255
Were you cooking breakfast?

58:33.463 --> 58:38.005
- I had a great time. Your house is nice.
- Thank you. It is, yeah.

58:38.088 --> 58:40.463
- Thank you for everything. Bye.
- No, thank you. Bye.

58:40.546 --> 58:43.380
- Have a good day. I'll call you.
- Sure, we'll talk.

58:43.463 --> 58:44.838
Bye, you beast.

58:45.005 --> 58:49.421
You, Mafe, are a cool girl. You are chill.

58:49.505 --> 58:54.255
That's what you are. A cool, chill girl.
People have told you that you are.

58:54.338 --> 58:57.171
And you know you are, deep down.

58:57.796 --> 59:01.671
If he calls you, fine.
And if he doesn't, it's fine, too.

59:01.755 --> 59:03.380
Chill. Cool.

59:03.463 --> 59:06.546
That's how life goes.
There's an eight-hour difference.

59:07.046 --> 59:09.505
No need to get all worked up.

59:10.963 --> 59:12.671
You do you. You...

59:14.671 --> 59:16.921
INCOMING CALL
UNKNOWN CALLER

59:17.005 --> 59:18.838
Shit!

59:20.338 --> 59:21.255
Hello, lovebug.

59:21.921 --> 59:23.421
Hi, is this María Fe?

59:24.630 --> 59:26.421
Yes. Who's calling?

59:27.005 --> 59:29.130
Jaime Castro,
editor at Patrimonio magazine.

59:29.213 --> 59:32.046
Santiago gave me your number.
I'd like to interview you.

59:32.130 --> 59:33.463
- Me?
- Yes.

59:33.546 --> 59:36.380
You run the "Soltera Codiciada" blog,
right?

59:36.463 --> 59:38.713
Yes, it was supposed to be anonymous.
I'm going to kill Santiago.

59:38.796 --> 59:41.005
It's okay,
I'm not going to reveal your identity.

59:41.088 --> 59:42.838
I wanted to ask you some questions.

59:42.921 --> 59:43.921
INCOMING CALL LOVEBUG

59:44.005 --> 59:48.421
Sorry, I'm not interested right now.
Maybe another time.

59:48.505 --> 59:49.630
But...

59:50.588 --> 59:51.588
Hi, lovebug.

59:56.671 --> 59:58.671
RECORDING AUDIO

01:00:09.463 --> 01:00:13.838
Fe? Hi. I called you,
but you didn't answer.

01:00:14.255 --> 01:00:18.380
But it's for the best.
I'm sorry I called you yesterday.

01:00:18.546 --> 01:00:20.380
I shouldn't have. It was a mistake.

01:00:20.588 --> 01:00:23.671
You were right,
we shouldn't let things get messy again.

01:00:24.296 --> 01:00:28.630
It won't happen again.
Bye, have a good one.

01:00:47.963 --> 01:00:51.963
That guy better have kidnapped you.
That has to be why you're not answering.

01:00:52.046 --> 01:00:53.588
Yeah.

01:00:54.796 --> 01:00:56.421
I need to know if you're okay

01:00:56.505 --> 01:01:00.255
and if you'll have the tissue presentation
ready for next week.

01:01:00.338 --> 01:01:01.588
An insistent guy, huh?

01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:05.088
Holy shit! Not you again, please!

01:01:05.255 --> 01:01:08.005
So, you watch series
where men are to blame for everything.

01:01:08.088 --> 01:01:10.671
You are to blame for everything.

01:01:10.755 --> 01:01:13.755
- You've become one of those girls.
- What kind of girl?

01:01:13.838 --> 01:01:15.588
Tell me, what kind of girl am I?

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:18.796
- The type that says all men are the same.
- Not all men are the same.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.296
But you, and specifically you,
you're a pain in the ovaries.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:23.546
What did I do?

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:27.338
You, with your fucking strategy of trying
to keep me close enough

01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:28.755
so that you don't miss me,

01:01:28.838 --> 01:01:31.463
but far enough so that I don't interfere
in your new life.

01:01:31.546 --> 01:01:34.796
What strategy, María Fe?
Don't you see it's all in your head?

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.380
What about my plans, Matías?

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:40.505
I could be traveling
around the world right now.

01:01:40.588 --> 01:01:44.005
Or writing a book, or having babies.

01:01:44.088 --> 01:01:45.963
How could you have babies?
Your cactuses die.

01:01:46.046 --> 01:01:49.296
But I'm here, stuck and feeling miserable

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:53.130
because the person that I tried
to make happy for six years

01:01:53.213 --> 01:01:56.713
keeps putting me in second place,
over and over again.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.505
You are where you want to be.

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:20.588
Mafe?

01:03:23.671 --> 01:03:24.630
I'm leaving.

01:03:25.046 --> 01:03:27.505
Could you buy me
a banana cupcake, please?

01:03:27.588 --> 01:03:30.671
Or a... No, a banana cupcake.
A cupcake.

01:03:34.046 --> 01:03:36.713
The six months will be up in a week.
The contract will end.

01:03:36.796 --> 01:03:39.880
- Here are the keys. Thank you.
- What? No. What?

01:03:39.963 --> 01:03:42.088
Lucy and Pollock are on the balcony.

01:03:42.171 --> 01:03:45.046
Okay? Water them just twice a week,
or they'll drown.

01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:48.338
And they're very sensitive,
so talk or sing to them, or something.

01:03:48.546 --> 01:03:50.713
You said you'd renew it
for six more months.

01:03:51.338 --> 01:03:52.380
Right, but not anymore.

01:03:52.838 --> 01:03:53.796
Why not?

01:03:54.755 --> 01:03:56.671
- I'm going on a trip.
- Where to?

01:03:58.213 --> 01:03:59.046
To a country.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.588
- To which country?
- A country.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.713
Which one?

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.880
It doesn't matter. I have this.
I can sleep anywhere. I'm fine.

01:04:11.088 --> 01:04:11.921
What?

01:04:12.213 --> 01:04:14.630
You do realize what you're doing, right?

01:04:15.671 --> 01:04:18.296
- What?
- You're repeating.

01:04:18.713 --> 01:04:19.671
The pattern.

01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:22.838
- What pattern?
- The bad pattern.

01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:24.505
No.

01:04:24.588 --> 01:04:27.338
Where you do the same thing
over and over again.

01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:30.296
So, you're in a place,
and then you get antsy and want to leave?

01:04:30.588 --> 01:04:33.880
Why? What's the problem? What's going on?

01:04:34.421 --> 01:04:36.838
I don't like getting too comfortable
in a place.

01:04:36.921 --> 01:04:40.213
So I get bored and have to leave
and go somewhere else.

01:04:40.296 --> 01:04:43.130
I can make you feel more uncomfortable
if you'd like.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.130
I can be dirty.

01:04:45.213 --> 01:04:47.296
I'll stop showering for weeks.
I have before.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.296
It's cool. I mean it.

01:04:49.463 --> 01:04:52.005
Want me to clog the shower drain
with my hair?

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:53.005
It's not necessary.

01:04:53.088 --> 01:04:54.796
What's so bad about staying here?

01:04:55.463 --> 01:04:57.421
You're not going anywhere. Are you crazy?

01:04:57.505 --> 01:05:00.421
No. This is your house.
Look at everything you've done.

01:05:00.505 --> 01:05:03.421
Look at how beautiful, organized,
and clean it is.

01:05:03.505 --> 01:05:07.338
You taught me to take care of the plants,
to paint, and all of that.

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:10.213
It's our house.

01:05:11.088 --> 01:05:13.171
And you're my sister now.

01:05:15.088 --> 01:05:16.921
And I love you, and all of that.

01:05:19.671 --> 01:05:22.046
I also... love you.

01:05:24.255 --> 01:05:26.713
- Well, you're screwed, then.
- No, you're screwed.

01:05:30.255 --> 01:05:31.838
- Don't run away, coward.
- I'm not.

01:05:31.921 --> 01:05:33.713
- My suitcase is over there.
- What's that?

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.796
It's nothing. It's a towel.

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:39.671
I'm going to the store.
Didn't you want a cupcake?

01:05:39.755 --> 01:05:41.171
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

01:05:41.713 --> 01:05:45.338
But we need to talk about this, Carolina.
I'm just saying, okay?

01:05:45.421 --> 01:05:48.796
These repetitive patterns concern me.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.838
- No. We're going to talk.
- Come on.

01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:52.213
- We have to eat first.
- Okay.

01:05:54.921 --> 01:05:57.338
The last question,
and I'll leave you alone, María Fe.

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.505
Why the name "Soltera Codiciada"?

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:03.130
Well, because "Almost 30
and Having an Existential Crisis"

01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:04.588
was already taken.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.630
Don't spit it out.

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:10.963
I'm going to turn this off.
I'm not recording anymore.

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.713
Thank you so much.

01:06:14.005 --> 01:06:15.963
It was a nice interview.
I had a great time.

01:06:16.046 --> 01:06:17.671
- Thank you.
- I have valuable information.

01:06:17.755 --> 01:06:20.380
Don't worry,
your name is my best kept secret.

01:06:20.463 --> 01:06:21.838
That's very important.

01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:24.963
Thank you. These have been
the best 30 minutes of fame

01:06:25.046 --> 01:06:27.171
that I've ever had.
My only minutes of fame.

01:06:27.255 --> 01:06:29.671
The only ones? Come on,
you'll be famous for a while.

01:06:29.755 --> 01:06:32.296
Your blog will be a big hit, I'm serious.

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:35.296
The women in my office get together
on Monday mornings.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.796
- It's like a gossiping ritual.
- What?

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.671
- They read your blog together.
- Really? That's awesome.

01:06:42.755 --> 01:06:47.296
Yes, and I must admit that I take a peek
and read it with them.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.213
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:51.713
- Yes, please.
- Cheers.

01:06:54.921 --> 01:07:01.380
Listen, would it be too... unprofessional
if we continued this somewhere else?

01:07:01.463 --> 01:07:04.130
Maybe take a walk
and get coffee or something?

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.505
A little bit, yes.

01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:10.546
But I told my boss
that I have a doctor's appointment.

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.630
So who am I to judge? Right?

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.588
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:17.338
We're on the same page, then.

01:07:18.255 --> 01:07:20.963
- Sure.
- Should I ask for the check so we can go?

01:07:21.046 --> 01:07:22.255
- Yes.
- Is that okay? Great.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:23.338
Thank you.

01:07:24.296 --> 01:07:28.963
As the saying goes, "When one door closes,
another one opens."

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.421
And now some advice for me.

01:07:32.046 --> 01:07:34.963
Look, a year and a half ago,
I broke up with my ex...

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:35.963
Cool.

01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:39.213
And I still can't get her off my mind.
I don't know what to do.

01:07:39.546 --> 01:07:40.630
I'll pass.

01:07:41.088 --> 01:07:43.505
Tell me, you're the single blogger.

01:07:43.588 --> 01:07:49.463
Well, sometimes, behind that open door,
an ex is hiding.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:52.588
Well, the first thing I did
was delete her from my phone.

01:07:52.671 --> 01:07:54.421
- Bye, contact info.
- Bye, WhatsApp.

01:07:54.505 --> 01:07:57.421
Bye, WhatsApp, photos,
and audio messages.

01:07:57.671 --> 01:08:01.171
- Then I unfriended her on Facebook. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:08:01.255 --> 01:08:04.338
What I can't do is stop following her
on Instagram.

01:08:04.421 --> 01:08:05.546
Instagraham!

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:08.213
Norton Bell, man!

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:13.755
And she insists on posting every day.
Every day she has a photo of whatever.

01:08:15.546 --> 01:08:19.005
Well, you can't get over her overnight.

01:08:20.671 --> 01:08:22.380
One day at a time.

01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:29.630
Like the day when the smallest thing
makes you feel empty inside.

01:08:35.046 --> 01:08:38.380
Or the day when somebody asks you
about that person,

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:41.087
and you don't know what to say.

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:50.462
Or the day when your head betrays you
with old habits.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:57.380
But there are also days when
you surprise yourself by doing new things.

01:08:57.755 --> 01:09:00.587
And days when you can laugh at yourself.

01:09:02.212 --> 01:09:05.421
So each tear is one more step forward.

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.587
Each day is a day closer
to you being well.

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.587
Live it, one tissue at a time.

01:09:17.212 --> 01:09:21.962
This is a draft, so it can change.
We can always improve it, right?

01:09:22.046 --> 01:09:25.880
But why would we change it?
I think it's good.

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:28.755
There's a connection,
it makes the brand relevant.

01:09:28.837 --> 01:09:31.921
I think it's in tune
with what I want to communicate.

01:09:32.005 --> 01:09:33.380
But we can do it. We could...

01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:35.171
No, leave it like this.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:38.630
I'm really very pleased.
I think you've done a great job.

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:39.755
Congratulations.

01:09:39.837 --> 01:09:41.837
I knew you'd like it. She's the best.

01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:42.880
That's great.

01:09:42.962 --> 01:09:45.630
Let me show you the ideas
I have for outdoor ads

01:09:45.712 --> 01:09:47.130
and social media.

01:09:48.255 --> 01:09:49.505
GENIUS!

01:09:49.587 --> 01:09:50.587
It's great.

01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:55.838
Cut that long hair.

01:09:56.213 --> 01:09:58.296
Kill those dreads.

01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:01.046
And wash that hair.

01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:10.588
The clients loved the campaign.

01:10:11.255 --> 01:10:12.088
Really?

01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:15.713
That's a success because they're a part
of a gigantic corporation.

01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:19.213
What we have to do is win
their brands one at a time.

01:10:19.296 --> 01:10:20.880
- Okay.
- What they want...

01:10:21.296 --> 01:10:23.296
is for you to head all of their jobs.

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.213
Really?

01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:28.338
So given the huge workload that's coming,

01:10:29.838 --> 01:10:31.213
what you deserve...

01:10:32.088 --> 01:10:33.463
is a promotion.

01:10:34.713 --> 01:10:36.755
- A promotion?
- Yes.

01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:39.046
Really?

01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:41.338
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:10:41.421 --> 01:10:42.505
Thanks.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:46.880
I have to talk it over with my associate,
but my decisions are always final.

01:10:47.005 --> 01:10:48.380
You're in.

01:10:50.005 --> 01:10:51.713
That's great. Thank you so much.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:57.005
Well, let's get to work!

01:10:57.963 --> 01:10:59.963
Don't distract the genius.

01:11:00.171 --> 01:11:01.630
Congratulations.

01:11:02.046 --> 01:11:03.421
Thank you.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:09.505
- Caro?
- Hey there.

01:11:09.588 --> 01:11:11.963
Caro, you won't believe the day I had!

01:11:12.046 --> 01:11:15.005
The presentation was amazing.
You should've seen Ramiro's face.

01:11:15.088 --> 01:11:17.463
I should've posted it on FB, I'm serious.

01:11:18.338 --> 01:11:19.880
We have a problem.

01:11:24.088 --> 01:11:25.005
Natalia?

01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:31.171
What's wrong?

01:11:37.963 --> 01:11:38.796
Okay.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:43.505
So you don't have a dress
for the wedding? I'll lend you one.

01:11:44.255 --> 01:11:47.380
There's a full moon today,
people get weird.

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:49.130
I just had some bacon.

01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:53.505
I called the girls from school

01:11:53.588 --> 01:11:56.463
to see if we'd get her a present
between all of us.

01:11:58.046 --> 01:12:00.130
They told me there's no wedding list,

01:12:00.213 --> 01:12:02.796
because after the wedding,
they're moving to New York.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880
Okay.

01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:07.546
They're moving to New York City.

01:12:07.713 --> 01:12:11.046
She got the grant
that I've been denied three times.

01:12:11.296 --> 01:12:13.338
- And?
- She has everything.

01:12:13.421 --> 01:12:16.296
The perfect body,
the perfect face, the perfect boyfriend.

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.005
The perfect job.

01:12:20.255 --> 01:12:21.130
I...

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:26.005
I thought it was necessary
to sacrifice something.

01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.546
I thought you had to focus
on only one thing to...

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.338
- I feel so stupid.
- Okay.

01:12:36.213 --> 01:12:37.171
Honey.

01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:41.421
Listen to me, honey. Listen.

01:12:42.505 --> 01:12:47.296
To start, you're an incredible woman.

01:12:47.505 --> 01:12:48.838
You are so successful.

01:12:49.505 --> 01:12:51.463
- But...
- Yes, there's a but.

01:12:51.838 --> 01:12:57.255
Maybe it's time for you
to stop focusing only on work,

01:12:57.338 --> 01:12:59.380
and start thinking about yourself.

01:12:59.463 --> 01:13:02.796
Maybe it's time for you to relax a bit.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.921
Listen to me, you're 29 years old.
You're not 89 years old.

01:13:08.005 --> 01:13:10.630
You have all the time in the world
to do things differently

01:13:10.713 --> 01:13:11.963
if you feel like it.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.505
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.796
Everything will be fine.

01:13:21.046 --> 01:13:24.630
Can I keep saying that I'm a feminist,
if I cried over Laura getting married?

01:13:24.713 --> 01:13:29.755
No, hand me your gun, your badge,
and your vibrator, please.

01:13:29.963 --> 01:13:33.963
- No, not my vibrator.
- Okay, let's toast.

01:13:34.046 --> 01:13:36.963
- What are we celebrating?
- She got a promotion.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:38.671
- What?
- Yes!

01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:41.005
That's great.

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:42.255
Well, let's celebrate.

01:13:42.338 --> 01:13:44.880
- Let's celebrate.
- With our favorite drink.

01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:46.588
I'm going to celebrate for real.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.921
- Everyone can get married.
- Who cares?

01:13:52.005 --> 01:13:56.046
I got married to a tree once.
Yes, it was a very beautiful ceremony.

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.380
But then they cut him down.
Cheers anyway.

01:13:58.463 --> 01:14:00.338
Here's to the tree
moving on to a better life.

01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:02.546
To paper and notebooks!

01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:17.463
Hello. Hi, how are you?

01:14:18.296 --> 01:14:19.671
Girlfriend...

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:22.921
Don't be offended, but it's a great idea
to come to a wedding without a date.

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:24.713
- Why is that?
- The suit effect.

01:14:24.796 --> 01:14:27.255
All men look better in a suit.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:29.838
The ugly ones become okay,
the okay ones become hot,

01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:32.963
and the hot ones become
"let's go have sex now."

01:14:33.046 --> 01:14:34.921
The Powerpuff Girls have arrived.

01:14:35.005 --> 01:14:36.588
Yay!

01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:37.921
And you're Blossom.

01:14:38.088 --> 01:14:40.171
- Blossom was the redhead.
- Yes.

01:14:40.255 --> 01:14:44.963
She should be Blossom.
You're the redhead. And you'd be Bubbles.

01:14:45.046 --> 01:14:47.380
- I'd be the green one.
- You all look beautiful.

01:14:47.463 --> 01:14:48.713
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:14:48.796 --> 01:14:51.838
I'll never understand how you get invited
to all the events in Lima.

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:54.755
- I'm the life of the party. You know that.
- We know it.

01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:56.171
There is Laurita!

01:14:56.463 --> 01:14:58.796
- She looks strange.
- She's too tall.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.630
- It's too...
- It doesn't look good.

01:15:00.713 --> 01:15:02.213
What's that about?

01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:04.213
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:10.130
Listen, tell me if it's my imagination,
or if the guy over there is Matías.

01:15:10.213 --> 01:15:12.838
Don't turn around. Don't look worried.

01:15:12.921 --> 01:15:16.005
On the count of three,
we'll laugh naturally at something.

01:15:16.088 --> 01:15:17.380
Then turn around
and tell me if it's him.

01:15:17.463 --> 01:15:18.338
- Okay?
- Yes.

01:15:18.421 --> 01:15:21.046
One, two, three.

01:15:25.005 --> 01:15:26.088
Shit, it's really him.

01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:27.546
- Really?
- Yes.

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:28.463
Fe...

01:15:30.213 --> 01:15:36.588
If dogs attack when they smell fear,
exes come back when they sense calm.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.421
- Don't start crying or get depressed.
- Don't leave the party just to avoid him.

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:44.921
But above all, don't hook up with him.

01:15:45.005 --> 01:15:47.296
Everything will be fine. Take it easy.

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.796
There is a survival plan for this.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.546
- First, no alcohol.
- No alcohol.

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:56.838
To survive this situation,
there are three basic rules.

01:15:56.921 --> 01:16:00.880
One, don't drink alcohol
because it makes you weaker.

01:16:01.088 --> 01:16:04.713
Two, talk
to the most attractive guy there.

01:16:04.796 --> 01:16:06.130
That's great.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:07.546
- Here he is.
- Hey.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.255
- How are you?
- Good, very good.

01:16:09.338 --> 01:16:11.088
- Javi, this is...
- Mafe.

01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:12.421
- Mafe.
- How are you?

01:16:12.505 --> 01:16:15.713
- This is my boyfriend, Javi.
- Great, nice to meet you.

01:16:16.463 --> 01:16:20.088
Three, act indifferent
when you run into him.

01:16:22.755 --> 01:16:28.046
If none of that works,
you can dive into the chocolate table.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.630
Hey.

01:16:34.005 --> 01:16:36.338
If I don't come over,
you won't congratulate us?

01:16:36.421 --> 01:16:39.296
Laurita, forgive me.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.421
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:16:41.505 --> 01:16:44.046
- Everything's beautiful. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:45.505
Do you remember Natalia?

01:16:46.546 --> 01:16:48.005
- No.
- Oh, come on.

01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:50.546
She's my childhood friend from school.

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:51.963
You never mentioned her.

01:16:52.046 --> 01:16:54.546
Oh, please.
We've known each other for ages.

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:57.130
She's so funny.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:17:01.296
Listen, she is Cupid's
number one mortal enemy.

01:17:01.546 --> 01:17:05.380
You can't imagine. They hate each other.
Can't stand the sight of each other.

01:17:05.463 --> 01:17:09.505
She's like Pennywise the Clown.
Terrified of love. Always alone.

01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:11.630
- I wouldn't say that.
- It's true.

01:17:11.713 --> 01:17:12.963
Did you bring a date today?

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:14.630
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:17.630
- Come on, Natalia.
- I'm serious, I brought a date.

01:17:17.713 --> 01:17:18.963
- Really?
- Yes.

01:17:19.046 --> 01:17:21.796
- Where is the poor guy?
- The bathroom. I'll introduce you later.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.088
- My love.
- There he is.

01:17:26.671 --> 01:17:27.630
There he is.

01:17:32.588 --> 01:17:35.463
Here he is.
This is my boyfriend, Santiago.

01:17:35.546 --> 01:17:36.588
- Hi, Santiago.
- How are you?

01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:38.338
I'm great. Congratulations.

01:17:38.838 --> 01:17:40.338
Well, we have to move on.

01:17:40.421 --> 01:17:42.421
- Enjoy.
- You, too.

01:17:42.505 --> 01:17:44.380
- Let's go.
- Congratulations.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:50.796
That was good, right?
It wasn't too much, right? Or was it?

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.588
Some chocolates for later?

01:18:00.005 --> 01:18:03.463
Are you sure I can leave you here
by yourself? Will you be okay?

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:05.296
Yes, I'll be fine.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.713
- Okay.
- It's fine.

01:18:06.796 --> 01:18:09.505
I'm going to leave soon.
My feet really hurt.

01:18:09.588 --> 01:18:11.505
Okay.

01:18:12.713 --> 01:18:15.546
Why are you speaking
with a Spanish accent?

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:18.421
It's because I met this amazing guy.

01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:20.880
He's so handsome, he makes me horny.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:25.213
So he asked me if I speak Spanish.
I said yes, but with a Spanish accent.

01:18:25.296 --> 01:18:30.338
Now I have to keep the act up,
or else he'll think that I'm a fake.

01:18:30.546 --> 01:18:31.755
And actually, I am.

01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:33.213
But he doesn't know that.

01:18:33.713 --> 01:18:35.838
I feel possessed.

01:18:36.046 --> 01:18:37.338
Infatuated.

01:18:43.921 --> 01:18:46.171
You still wear those heels
that hurt your feet?

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.963
You should throw them away, it's silly.

01:18:49.046 --> 01:18:50.505
I'm not silly.

01:18:51.421 --> 01:18:52.463
What do you want?

01:18:52.546 --> 01:18:54.046
Can I stay here for a bit?

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:57.296
You're already here. What's going on?

01:18:57.838 --> 01:18:59.796
I've been meaning to talk to you.

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.421
I don't have any missed calls from you,
Matías.

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:06.171
I'd have one if you wanted to talk to me.
I don't want to talk.

01:19:06.255 --> 01:19:10.213
Just let me tell you what I wanted to say.
I'll say it, and I'll leave you alone.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.421
I wanted to apologize for being an idiot.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.046
I miss you a lot.

01:19:24.046 --> 01:19:25.505
I've thought a lot about you.

01:19:26.505 --> 01:19:29.213
It's been so hard for me
to be over there by myself.

01:19:30.546 --> 01:19:32.088
Getting used to everything...

01:19:33.546 --> 01:19:36.463
I had to stop myself
from texting and calling you.

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.630
- You're drunk, right?
- No.

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:41.713
I'm telling you how I really feel.

01:19:42.338 --> 01:19:43.838
Who else would I tell?

01:19:46.963 --> 01:19:48.463
It hasn't been easy for me.

01:19:50.505 --> 01:19:53.005
There were times when I thought,
what am I doing here?

01:19:53.213 --> 01:19:54.963
What am I doing with my life?

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:57.005
I was confused.

01:19:58.005 --> 01:19:59.838
I screwed up, Fe.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.838
I didn't want to fuck things up.
I'm really sorry.

01:20:07.088 --> 01:20:10.588
You don't have to apologize to me,
it's not necessary.

01:20:10.671 --> 01:20:12.963
Just stop dragging me
into your problems.

01:20:13.046 --> 01:20:14.338
If you're confused...

01:20:14.421 --> 01:20:17.630
You have no right to come here
and mess with my head.

01:20:17.713 --> 01:20:19.088
I messed up, I know that.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.213
I want to apologize for that.

01:20:25.796 --> 01:20:26.963
I've been thinking a lot.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.963
I read your blog.

01:20:32.213 --> 01:20:33.380
I think it's great.

01:20:34.505 --> 01:20:37.463
I'm glad you're writing.
It was what you wanted, right?

01:20:39.755 --> 01:20:42.296
I arrived in Lima,
and I wanted to go see you.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.588
I wanted to know how you're doing,
meet up.

01:20:47.505 --> 01:20:49.546
Why are you telling me all this?

01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:54.671
Because it's the truth.

01:21:04.005 --> 01:21:05.963
Okay.

01:21:09.963 --> 01:21:12.046
Do you still pay attention to signs?

01:21:14.838 --> 01:21:17.546
Today, the moon lines up with Mars, and...

01:21:17.796 --> 01:21:20.046
and your aura is, like, orange or red.

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:23.338
Do you realize that what you're saying
makes no sense?

01:21:30.463 --> 01:21:31.671
One song?

01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:15.213
I came to this wedding
just because of you.

01:22:16.796 --> 01:22:18.921
I missed you a lot, Fe.

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:23.463
No.

01:22:25.838 --> 01:22:27.713
No, I'm sorry.

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:32.296
- Fe.
- What?

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.671
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean?

01:22:33.755 --> 01:22:35.213
Do you not love me anymore?

01:22:35.296 --> 01:22:39.046
I have too much alcohol in my blood
to have this talk.

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:40.630
- I can't now.
- I need an answer.

01:22:40.713 --> 01:22:44.171
What do you want to know?
Matías, we'll talk tomorrow, okay?

01:22:44.255 --> 01:22:46.671
- It'll be better.
- No, I need to know.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.213
Fe...

01:22:50.755 --> 01:22:51.838
I'm here.

01:22:54.088 --> 01:22:55.088
For you.

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:42.213
SLACKER

01:23:46.546 --> 01:23:49.380
It was hot and there was fire
between us

01:23:49.463 --> 01:23:52.130
and all of that,
but we're not husband and wife.

01:23:52.213 --> 01:23:54.630
So he left. He took the bus and left.

01:23:54.713 --> 01:23:57.005
I don't get
why you talk like a Spaniard to them.

01:23:57.088 --> 01:24:00.505
Come on, it's hot.
Don't accents turn you on?

01:24:00.588 --> 01:24:02.255
- I don't know.
- It's romantic.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:05.255
Imagine the rose petals and the stud.

01:24:05.338 --> 01:24:06.755
Oh, come on!

01:24:06.838 --> 01:24:08.255
You've never had sex
in a different language?

01:24:08.546 --> 01:24:10.671
- In Chinese once.
- Oh, no.

01:24:10.755 --> 01:24:13.088
- What? Chinese can be very sensual.
- Good morning.

01:24:13.171 --> 01:24:15.505
- Hey.
- Sleeping Beauty woke up.

01:24:15.588 --> 01:24:16.880
What are you doing here?

01:24:17.046 --> 01:24:20.046
- So much love, good morning to you, too.
- Good morning.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.338
You left yesterday
without saying anything. I was worried.

01:24:23.963 --> 01:24:26.046
- You forgot your purse.
- Oh, thank you.

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.796
I'll put it away now.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.546
- How delicious.
- Thank you.

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:32.046
- Hi, good morning.
- Hi.

01:24:32.255 --> 01:24:33.796
- Hi, Natalia.
- Good morning.

01:24:34.963 --> 01:24:36.338
My roommate Carolina. This is Matías.

01:24:36.421 --> 01:24:37.838
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Caro.

01:24:37.921 --> 01:24:40.046
- I'm Matías.
- How are you?

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:42.463
- Fine.
- Do you want to eat anything?

01:24:43.171 --> 01:24:44.713
Carolina is a great cook.

01:24:45.005 --> 01:24:47.171
She makes some things like...

01:24:47.255 --> 01:24:49.838
- What did you make?
- Oatmeal and yogurt.

01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:52.130
- How delicious.
- And chia seeds and stuff.

01:24:52.213 --> 01:24:54.338
- She makes it from scratch.
- It has no sugar.

01:24:54.921 --> 01:24:57.338
- Do you like it?
- It's good.

01:24:57.546 --> 01:24:59.671
Why don't we ask tomorrow?
Maybe he'll change his mind.

01:25:00.755 --> 01:25:02.171
- Natalia...
- What?

01:25:02.255 --> 01:25:03.546
Shut up.

01:25:09.171 --> 01:25:11.130
- You live in Madrid, right?
- Yes.

01:25:11.213 --> 01:25:12.171
How is it?

01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:15.463
- It's beautiful.
- What about the Spanish women?

01:25:15.921 --> 01:25:16.796
Enough.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.255
I prefer the Peruvian women.

01:25:19.171 --> 01:25:21.755
- I'll head out now.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:22.755 --> 01:25:24.880
I'll talk to my aunt today
about the tickets.

01:25:24.963 --> 01:25:26.463
Okay, we'll talk later.

01:25:28.963 --> 01:25:30.463
Nice to meet you, Caro.

01:25:30.546 --> 01:25:32.046
- Bye.
- Take care.

01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:33.755
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:25:39.796 --> 01:25:41.421
So, you're going to Madrid.

01:25:41.838 --> 01:25:44.463
Just to make things clear,
this is the news:

01:25:44.546 --> 01:25:47.046
Matías has asked me
to go live with him in Madrid.

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:49.463
But I told him I need to think about it.

01:25:49.546 --> 01:25:51.505
Okay? Are we good?

01:25:53.838 --> 01:25:55.671
We're good, thanks.

01:25:55.755 --> 01:25:59.546
Will you continue with the blog?
You were really happy about that, right?

01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:01.588
Of course,
I'll continue writing my blog.

01:26:01.671 --> 01:26:04.130
I'm not going to move to a cave
in the forest.

01:26:04.213 --> 01:26:05.046
Are you sure?

01:26:05.130 --> 01:26:09.380
You didn't write one word
during your six years with him.

01:26:09.463 --> 01:26:11.088
I remember. I don't know if you do,

01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:13.338
- but I remember.
- What is it?

01:26:13.921 --> 01:26:15.046
I'm telling you the truth.

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.380
When he's here,
everything revolves around him.

01:26:17.463 --> 01:26:20.130
You disappear.
That's not a healthy relationship.

01:26:20.796 --> 01:26:23.130
What do you know about relationships?

01:26:23.338 --> 01:26:26.088
Based on your vast experience with love,
what do you know?

01:26:26.171 --> 01:26:28.296
Girls, why don't we have breakfast,
and then...

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.171
- Shut up, Carolina!
- You're right.

01:26:30.255 --> 01:26:32.130
Maybe I don't know about relationships.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.546
But I do know you.
This is not a good idea, and you know it.

01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:40.296
How is it not a good idea?
Natalia, you've seen me without him.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.338
- How did I feel? Like shit.
- Yes.

01:26:42.421 --> 01:26:43.588
I felt like shit.

01:26:43.671 --> 01:26:45.713
Now he shows up, he regrets what he did,

01:26:45.796 --> 01:26:50.046
he apologizes, he asks me
to move to Madrid with him.

01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:52.338
I'm happy with him. What's the problem?

01:26:52.421 --> 01:26:55.046
You can't be happy if you only focus
on making him happy.

01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:57.046
I don't get it. Please explain it to me.

01:26:57.505 --> 01:26:59.338
Tell me, how can you be happy like that?

01:26:59.421 --> 01:27:03.505
- You're so dense, so insensitive.
- You can't handle hearing the truth.

01:27:03.588 --> 01:27:05.921
- No!
- Yes, look at yourself.

01:27:06.005 --> 01:27:09.380
I'm like this because you can't stand
that I'm happy.

01:27:22.255 --> 01:27:24.713
LESSON 29: LEARN TO UNLEARN

01:27:26.421 --> 01:27:28.630
WHERE IS THIS WEEK'S POST?

01:27:28.713 --> 01:27:30.921
THERE'S NO NEW POST?

01:27:31.005 --> 01:27:33.630
SOLTERA, DON'T LEAVE US!

01:27:33.713 --> 01:27:37.421
WE NEED YOU

01:27:58.255 --> 01:28:00.255
2018 CALENDAR

01:28:00.338 --> 01:28:02.338
ANTI-PRINCESSES AND ANTIHEROES

01:28:16.546 --> 01:28:20.046
Hey, you should've told me
the elevator wasn't working.

01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:22.630
I had to go up hundreds of steps.

01:28:23.255 --> 01:28:24.713
When I came up, it was working.

01:28:24.796 --> 01:28:26.963
Like this shitty camera
that stopped working.

01:28:27.046 --> 01:28:30.213
- What's wrong with it?
- Something with the lens.

01:28:30.421 --> 01:28:32.338
Everything looks beautiful.

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.838
- I spoke with my aunt.
- Did you?

01:28:35.921 --> 01:28:38.546
She'll book your flight
for the last week in July.

01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:43.921
After you resign, you'll need a month
or two to prepare for the move.

01:28:44.005 --> 01:28:45.380
That sounds about right.

01:28:45.463 --> 01:28:47.713
I have a colleague there
who works in advertising.

01:28:47.796 --> 01:28:50.130
He's really great,
and I told him about you.

01:28:50.213 --> 01:28:52.671
He'll let you know if he has any projects.
Cool, right?

01:28:52.755 --> 01:28:53.588
Cool.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:57.880
It looks like you've done many things
without me.

01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:01.838
That's enough with the camera.

01:29:02.463 --> 01:29:04.505
I want a nice photo before we leave.

01:29:07.088 --> 01:29:09.463
Okay, I'll let go of the camera.

01:29:09.546 --> 01:29:11.713
We're going to relax and have some wine.

01:29:11.796 --> 01:29:12.630
Great.

01:29:13.046 --> 01:29:14.546
Will you pass me the wine opener?

01:29:14.671 --> 01:29:17.338
- Oh, shoot.
- What?

01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:19.796
I forgot it.

01:29:21.213 --> 01:29:24.463
- I'll go get it now.
- No, no, don't worry.

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:33.505
What?

01:29:33.713 --> 01:29:34.671
Listen.

01:29:36.046 --> 01:29:37.088
What is it?

01:29:39.046 --> 01:29:42.088
Only in Lima can an alarm go off
at this hour and go all night.

01:29:42.463 --> 01:29:45.130
In Spain, they fine you.
This idiot's probably so far away

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.963
that he can't hear the alarm.

01:29:48.213 --> 01:29:50.630
Well, it'll turn off soon enough.

01:29:52.963 --> 01:29:54.796
We should just leave.

01:29:55.671 --> 01:29:57.171
I'm tired of living here.

01:30:00.463 --> 01:30:02.213
I like Lima.

01:30:02.421 --> 01:30:03.921
- Really?
- Yes.

01:30:04.796 --> 01:30:05.963
Of course.

01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:11.421
I like my neighborhood.

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.671
I like my house.

01:30:16.046 --> 01:30:19.505
Walking around, going to the market,
I don't know, stuff like that...

01:30:21.588 --> 01:30:22.713
See? It turned off.

01:30:41.755 --> 01:30:42.588
Matías.

01:30:43.963 --> 01:30:44.796
I think...

01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:48.838
I think that I want to stay here.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.963
I don't think I want to go to Madrid.

01:30:56.171 --> 01:30:57.588
You're joking, right?

01:31:00.046 --> 01:31:02.130
I told you I was going to think about it.

01:31:02.213 --> 01:31:03.421
It was an obvious yes.

01:31:03.713 --> 01:31:04.796
Not really.

01:31:05.005 --> 01:31:07.588
You wanted to move eight months ago.
What happened?

01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:11.338
We haven't spoken in eight months.
Everything has changed.

01:31:11.421 --> 01:31:13.338
No, things are the same.
It's you and me.

01:31:13.421 --> 01:31:14.421
No.

01:31:15.796 --> 01:31:17.755
No, it's not the same.

01:31:18.505 --> 01:31:19.630
It's like...

01:31:20.796 --> 01:31:24.671
To be with you,
I have to be where you are.

01:31:25.338 --> 01:31:28.838
Would you drop your master's degree
to be with me?

01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:31.546
- It's not the same thing.
- Yes, it's the same.

01:31:38.463 --> 01:31:41.296
Matías,
when you decided to be without me

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:47.630
I thought I'd die from the pain.
I mean it.

01:31:49.713 --> 01:31:53.838
Now you show up with this proposal,
and I...

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.630
I'm scared to death.

01:31:58.296 --> 01:31:59.505
Because...

01:32:02.255 --> 01:32:04.005
Because by being without you,

01:32:04.671 --> 01:32:06.838
I've found myself.

01:32:08.088 --> 01:32:09.171
On my own.

01:32:10.130 --> 01:32:11.713
Just recently.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.588
I don't understand you.

01:32:19.796 --> 01:32:21.171
You don't want to travel?

01:32:24.546 --> 01:32:25.505
So that's it?

01:32:29.963 --> 01:32:31.255
I think so.

01:32:35.671 --> 01:32:37.546
Really? Just like that?

01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:39.255
Not just like that.

01:32:40.213 --> 01:32:41.671
Not just like that.

01:32:42.213 --> 01:32:43.463
And you know that.

01:32:50.713 --> 01:32:51.755
Now what?

01:32:55.171 --> 01:32:56.713
Well, now...

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.838
SLACKER

01:33:33.755 --> 01:33:34.796
No.

01:33:36.463 --> 01:33:38.005
- The darker one.
- The darker one?

01:33:38.088 --> 01:33:40.588
Yes, with the gray scale.

01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:43.505
No, the darker one...

01:33:44.588 --> 01:33:46.338
- Ramiro.
- Hey, genius!

01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:48.505
I was about to ask you
to sign the contract.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.130
I quit.

01:33:52.088 --> 01:33:53.046
Excuse me?

01:33:53.546 --> 01:33:57.171
I am truly thankful for the opportunity.

01:33:57.255 --> 01:34:00.880
But there is something
I need to do right now.

01:34:02.588 --> 01:34:05.796
I want... I'm going to write a book.

01:34:09.421 --> 01:34:11.088
You'll write a book.

01:34:14.588 --> 01:34:17.255
You want to write a book here in Peru,
where nobody reads.

01:34:17.338 --> 01:34:18.588
Yes.

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:23.088
Has anyone read a book in the past month?

01:34:27.421 --> 01:34:31.130
So everyone reads books now.
So we're all readers now.

01:34:33.338 --> 01:34:35.671
Okay, is this a move
to ask for more money?

01:34:35.755 --> 01:34:38.380
- Or what?
- No, not at all.

01:34:38.463 --> 01:34:41.671
I just need to do this now.
I can't put it off any longer.

01:34:41.755 --> 01:34:46.796
Don't worry about the tissues.
I'll leave everything ready for you.

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.588
- I'll take care of it.
- Don't worry.

01:34:48.671 --> 01:34:50.713
Really, don't worry about it.

01:34:50.796 --> 01:34:55.088
If you want to leave now, go ahead.
No problem, I won't go after you.

01:34:56.338 --> 01:34:59.546
- Okay, thanks.
- But let me give you some advice.

01:35:01.171 --> 01:35:04.338
Maybe the offer and the contract

01:35:04.421 --> 01:35:07.296
made you think you can play
in the big leagues.

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.421
But don't fool yourself, really.

01:35:09.588 --> 01:35:12.088
I'm being honest here.
You're not a good writer.

01:35:13.088 --> 01:35:15.630
You need a lot more to be a good writer.

01:35:16.630 --> 01:35:18.588
Don't risk what you have.

01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:21.921
I'm serious. You could lose it all.

01:35:22.005 --> 01:35:24.921
I know.

01:35:25.838 --> 01:35:27.505
And maybe you're right.

01:35:28.505 --> 01:35:34.171
Maybe I still have a lot to learn.
And maybe nobody will read what I write.

01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:41.255
But I would rather do that,
even if I make a ton of mistakes,

01:35:41.588 --> 01:35:44.130
than continue working for a misogynist,

01:35:44.213 --> 01:35:47.838
sexist, racist,
and homophobic man like you.

01:35:50.255 --> 01:35:53.921
I don't know if I impressed you,
or if I needed more...

01:35:58.755 --> 01:36:00.880
Take that, dumb-ass!

01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:10.213
Stop talking with an Argentinian accent!
You're not from Argentina.

01:36:10.296 --> 01:36:13.005
You spent four months in Argentina!

01:36:28.171 --> 01:36:29.213
Why are you here?

01:36:30.463 --> 01:36:32.171
- María Fe...
- What?

01:36:32.255 --> 01:36:34.421
I'm fixing the pipes.

01:36:36.338 --> 01:36:41.213
Oh, so that's what they call it now!
Fixing the pipes.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:45.213
Look at you.

01:36:48.046 --> 01:36:49.296
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.463
- I can't take this anymore...
- I'm sorry...

01:36:52.546 --> 01:36:54.338
- I feel so sad...
- I'm serious...

01:36:54.421 --> 01:36:56.796
- I overstepped...
- No, you didn't.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.046
- I have to face that...
- No, I was wrong...

01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:00.296
I broke up with Matías.

01:37:00.546 --> 01:37:03.005
- What did you say?
- She broke up with Matías.

01:37:07.463 --> 01:37:08.338
Are you okay?

01:37:10.296 --> 01:37:11.255
Yes.

01:37:13.213 --> 01:37:15.505
And I want to make my blog into a book.

01:37:15.588 --> 01:37:17.213
- Really?
- Yes.

01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:21.921
- It's going to be a hit.
- Yes!

01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:23.380
You're already a hit.

01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:24.921
- Let's never fight again.
- Never.

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.838
- It was horrible.
- It was horrible.

01:37:26.921 --> 01:37:29.255
- I had stomach pains.
- I couldn't sleep.

01:37:29.588 --> 01:37:31.255
Will you tell me what's going on?

01:37:31.338 --> 01:37:32.963
- Where?
- So is he really...

01:37:33.046 --> 01:37:34.546
Is he really fixing the pipes?

01:37:34.630 --> 01:37:35.921
- Or is it a joke?
- It's true.

01:37:36.005 --> 01:37:37.921
He's fixing other things, too.

01:37:38.005 --> 01:37:39.463
Is he fixing other things?

01:37:39.546 --> 01:37:40.755
What else is he fixing?

01:37:40.838 --> 01:37:42.880
You're being affectionate!

01:37:42.963 --> 01:37:45.713
Did you just call her baby?
Are you all sweet now?

01:37:45.796 --> 01:37:47.505
- I don't know.
- Like a little girl?

01:37:47.588 --> 01:37:49.671
- I don't know.
- Are you little Natalia?

01:37:49.755 --> 01:37:52.171
- She's blushing.
- She is blushing!

01:37:52.255 --> 01:37:56.255
PATIENCE

01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:08.671
And then that day arrives.

01:38:08.755 --> 01:38:13.296
There's no way to predict the exact dates
and no formulas that take you there.

01:38:17.005 --> 01:38:19.463
- Friends...
- What's up?

01:38:20.963 --> 01:38:23.296
- I think I finished.
- What?

01:38:23.755 --> 01:38:25.255
The book.

01:38:25.421 --> 01:38:26.921
- What?
- Yes!

01:38:27.005 --> 01:38:30.046
- No way!
- Oh, my goodness!

01:38:35.005 --> 01:38:38.588
I was referring to the structure.
I still have to write the book.

01:38:40.213 --> 01:38:43.088
- Well, cheers.
- Yes, cheers!

01:38:43.171 --> 01:38:45.713
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

01:38:45.796 --> 01:38:47.630
Cheers to you!

01:38:47.713 --> 01:38:48.838
- Let's take a look.
- Want to?

01:38:48.921 --> 01:38:54.046
So, I want to make fun of fairy tales.
So each color represents a chapter.

01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:56.755
You'll have this strange feeling of peace.

01:38:56.838 --> 01:38:58.713
And you'll smile thinking,

01:38:59.005 --> 01:39:02.046
"Good for you, slacker!
It was about time!"

01:39:11.171 --> 01:39:14.671
We've been taught that we're the princess
in the fairy tale.

01:39:15.005 --> 01:39:20.713
But we can also be the fairy godmother
if a friend needs our help.

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.463
Or the genie in the lamp

01:39:22.546 --> 01:39:26.005
when we try
to meet everyone's expectations at once.

01:39:26.088 --> 01:39:30.463
And above all,
we can also be prince charming.

01:39:30.796 --> 01:39:34.838
Because a princess who respects herself,
rescues herself.
