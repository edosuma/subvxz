WEBVTT

03:14.487 --> 03:17.448
Would you like to see before, you know...

03:19.117 --> 03:20.285
Yeah.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.629
Brian? Who's this?

03:31.880 --> 03:34.340
You know, I asked myself the same thing
when my dad passed.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.717
I said, "Who is this man?"

03:35.800 --> 03:37.969
No, no, Brian. Who's this in the coffin?

03:38.052 --> 03:41.055
- Because that's not my father.
- Are you sure?

03:41.139 --> 03:43.474
Are you asking me if I'm sure
I know what my father looks like?

03:43.558 --> 03:45.643
No, people make mistakes
in a time of grief, Aaron.

03:45.727 --> 03:47.896
Look at the damn body, man.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.732
Oh, shit.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.901
- You got Jackie Chan in there!
- Okay, listen...

03:52.984 --> 03:55.778
Come on, Brian.
You know what my father looks like.

03:55.862 --> 03:57.071
We are very scattered today.

03:57.155 --> 03:58.698
This type of thing almost never happens.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.700
- Almost never happens?
- I said that out loud?

04:00.825 --> 04:03.578
It's not Burger King.
You can't just mess up my order.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.580
Please, just calm down.
I think I know where he is.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.040
You think?

04:07.165 --> 04:10.877
If my dad's not in this coffin in one hour,
then you have to take his place.

04:11.002 --> 04:13.421
- You got it?
- Don't worry. I'll get him back.

04:13.504 --> 04:18.051
I promise that. He's in one of two places.
I think it's the second place.

04:18.176 --> 04:21.387
Listen, okay, guys? Let's pack this up.
Close this.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.931
Let's go, let's get out of here.

04:23.014 --> 04:27.060
Wait a minute, before we move...
Okay. Did I give you my keys?

04:27.685 --> 04:30.438
No. They in the car.
I left the damn keys in the car.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.565
Let's go, guys. I think it's on.

04:32.690 --> 04:35.401
If you're so antsy about being here,
why'd you come out in the first place?

04:35.526 --> 04:37.946
- You know why.
- I hate funerals.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.365
All about death, death, death.

04:40.448 --> 04:44.118
I don't think funerals are designed
for anybody to like, Norman.

04:44.202 --> 04:45.745
I suppose.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.539
I don't want a regular funeral
when it's my time to go, you know.

04:48.623 --> 04:50.541
I want my life celebrated.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.212
Like Anna Nicole Smith, Richard Nixon,
somebody big and powerful.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.130
I want mine to be the saddest day ever.

04:56.214 --> 04:59.300
Stock market should crash,
factories shut down,

04:59.384 --> 05:01.094
girls crying in the streets.

05:01.219 --> 05:04.722
That kind of thing. An
eclipse would be nice.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.891
- Come on.
- What?

05:06.975 --> 05:09.310
You still smoking after all of
those warnings and stuff out there?

05:09.394 --> 05:12.188
No, Norman, stop, all right.
You used to smoke.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.398
We used to smoke together.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.067
I used to piss my pants and then I stopped.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.945
I got my own problems to worry about
without worrying about your damn smoking.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.114
Come on, Norman.
What problems you got, man?

05:21.239 --> 05:24.575
- I told you! My rash!
- Got to use condoms, papa.

05:24.659 --> 05:27.704
- On my hand, dude.
- You still have to use a condom, Norman.

05:27.787 --> 05:28.997
That's the first line of defence.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.833
This shit ain't normal. Look at it.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.128
- Fuck. That ain't a rash, man.
- What you think it is?

05:35.253 --> 05:38.756
I don't know, but it's very splotchy.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.468
Splotchy? I hate splotchy.
I'm gonna pass away, I'm gonna die!

05:42.593 --> 05:44.095
- Nah.
- And I'm so damn young!

05:44.595 --> 05:46.639
They brought the wrong body.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.600
Honey, did you hear me?
They brought the wrong body.

05:49.684 --> 05:51.352
Oh, my God!
Well, do they know where he is?

05:51.436 --> 05:52.979
They think so.

05:55.023 --> 05:57.108
I told you.
I told you not to use the Marshalls,

05:57.191 --> 05:59.235
but, no, you wanted to keep it all
in the neighbourhood.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.363
Don't rub it in, not today.
I got too much to worry about.

06:02.447 --> 06:06.200
Dad insisted on having his funeral
at home, so now I just can't escape it.

06:06.284 --> 06:07.952
Death is everywhere.

06:08.036 --> 06:10.121
Baby, no. No, it's not.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.748
Mom won't stop crying.

06:11.831 --> 06:13.875
- Ryan hasn't helped out.
- Not like he ever does.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.294
Plus on top of that, I got to worry
about this whole eulogy thing.

06:16.377 --> 06:19.922
I am sure it'll be the best eulogy
anybody's ever heard.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.340
Doesn't matter.

06:21.466 --> 06:24.844
All anybody's gonna be thinking is,
"Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy?

06:24.969 --> 06:27.013
"Step aside and let the writer
say a few words."

06:27.138 --> 06:28.222
Even I'm gonna be thinking it.

06:28.306 --> 06:31.142
Why don't you just let him do it then?

06:32.310 --> 06:33.644
So, now you want Ryan to do the eulogy?

06:33.728 --> 06:34.854
No. I'm just saying...

06:34.979 --> 06:37.023
You're just saying that you wanna
hear Ryan's eulogy.

06:37.148 --> 06:38.441
No. You're the oldest, so...

06:38.524 --> 06:40.610
So, the only reason I should do it
is because I'm old.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.528
Aaron, calm down.

06:43.154 --> 06:46.491
I think that you are every bit
as good a writer as your brother.

06:46.574 --> 06:50.745
I just think that you need to let
someone actually read your book.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.413
It's not ready yet.

06:52.497 --> 06:55.875
Okay, fine. But don't forget,
we close on the house next week.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.836
- I know.
- I mean, I love your mom,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.963
but I am so ready to move.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.674
I know, honey,
but we just got to get through today, okay?

07:03.758 --> 07:05.093
Exactly.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.678
I know this is rough.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.223
But it's the last day of my cycle.

07:10.348 --> 07:13.601
And I'm 37 years old, so we need to try to,

07:13.684 --> 07:18.439
you know, we need to do it,
at least once today, okay?

07:18.523 --> 07:19.690
- Babe.
- Yeah?

07:19.774 --> 07:24.403
You're gonna have to switch that cycle
down to low for now, just for now.

07:25.363 --> 07:27.406
Can we at least find the body first?

07:32.245 --> 07:35.206
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, absolutely.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.752
Okay, I'm a... I'm a little nervous.

07:40.545 --> 07:41.963
Why, because you're gonna see
my dad again?

07:42.046 --> 07:45.466
I just don't think I've ever been
so openly hated by anyone before.

07:45.550 --> 07:46.801
Even my seventh graders aren't that mean.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.971
I think he's gonna be more concerned today
that his brother just died than be...

07:50.054 --> 07:52.431
- Babe.
- I'm sorry, baby. It's the traffic.

07:52.557 --> 07:54.892
Right. Anyway, when I tell him
that we're getting married,

07:54.976 --> 07:57.436
he's just gonna have to accept you. I...

07:57.562 --> 07:59.647
- Jesus! Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.190
- You asshole!
- Fuck you, bitch.

08:01.274 --> 08:04.110
Oh, yeah, flip me off.
Can't you see there's a traffic jam?

08:04.235 --> 08:05.862
You poke your eye out,
your father's gonna kill me.

08:05.945 --> 08:07.780
- Oscar, baby.
- Yes.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.031
- Look at me.
- Okay.

08:09.115 --> 08:10.658
- Relax. Okay?
- All right.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.077
Everything is fine. Okay? Breathe.

08:13.161 --> 08:14.412
Okay.

08:16.581 --> 08:17.665
- Better?
- Better.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.584
Oh, good. It's okay.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.836
Fuck you!

08:25.756 --> 08:28.467
I think you'll find that
everything is in perfect order.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.512
Oh, so, now you wanna be professional.

08:31.596 --> 08:33.306
You got your keys?
You got your BlackBerry?

08:33.389 --> 08:35.474
Because once we bury him,
we not gonna dig him back up

08:35.558 --> 08:37.018
just so you can tweet.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.811
Look, I'm trying, okay?

08:38.895 --> 08:40.688
Hey, how is your mother holding up, Aaron?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.440
She's fine. She's in great health.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.066
- There's no more business here.
- Good.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.902
What about your Uncle Russell?
He wasn't doing that well.

08:45.985 --> 08:47.069
- How's he doing?
- Bye.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.822
Okay, I'm just asking.
It's conversation, that's all.

08:49.906 --> 08:52.992
I'm here if you need me, you know that.
Thank you for everything.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.410
- Michelle, come here.
- Bye, Brian.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.870
You don't have to come.

08:56.037 --> 08:59.916
I'm just saying, everybody knows
that the Colonel stole that recipe

08:59.999 --> 09:03.044
for fried chicken from
a slave named Jubalai.

09:03.127 --> 09:06.923
Now, I give him credit for the coleslaw,
but that's it.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.927
Hey, buddy! How you doing?

09:11.010 --> 09:14.222
I need a favour.
I need you to pick up Uncle Russell.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.891
Yeah, I know it's a hassle,
but you're the closest.

09:16.974 --> 09:21.479
- Damn! He's always in a bad mood.
- Just say you'll do it. We'll do it.

09:21.562 --> 09:26.067
It's not a mood if he's always in it.
It's his personality. Can you do it?

09:26.150 --> 09:28.152
All right, I'll do it.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.492
Hey, Mama. How you holding up?

09:34.867 --> 09:38.162
There were so many things
we wanted to do still.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.123
Travel.
We were going to Australia and China.

09:41.207 --> 09:42.291
He wanted to go to Thailand.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.418
Oh, come on, Ma,
you're not gonna fly 25 hours.

09:44.502 --> 09:47.713
That's not the point.
I haven't been feeling well.

09:47.797 --> 09:50.675
Who knows how long
I'm gonna live without him?

09:50.758 --> 09:53.594
It might make a difference
if I had a grandchild

09:53.678 --> 09:56.931
who could take my mind off
of everything, but...

09:57.598 --> 09:59.517
- Oh, well.
- Cynthia, we are trying.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.896
I know what you're trying to do, Michelle,
all hours of the day and night, trying.

10:03.980 --> 10:06.357
But it doesn't seem to be working,
now does it?

10:06.440 --> 10:09.318
- Where's Ryan? Have you talked to him yet?
- He should be here soon.

10:09.402 --> 10:13.406
Just to see his face
would make me feel so much better.

10:13.489 --> 10:16.909
Oh, I have missed him so much. My baby.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.203
Do you need me to do something, Cynthia?

10:19.287 --> 10:22.581
You could take your hand off
my husband's coffin.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.126
You are leaving a smudge mark.

10:28.421 --> 10:30.840
Is she shooting us the finger?
Or is she just waving?

10:30.923 --> 10:33.426
That's nice, ladies! Thank you!

10:36.762 --> 10:38.014
- There he is.
- What?

10:38.097 --> 10:39.390
- He's okay.
- He's gonna need assistance?

10:39.473 --> 10:41.100
He's just grumpy.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.853
You got to know how to handle him.

10:46.564 --> 10:48.232
Oh, he looks kind of sweet.

10:48.316 --> 10:49.567
- Hi, Uncle Russell!
- Hi, Uncle Russell!

10:49.650 --> 10:51.152
You remember me? I'm Norman.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.571
I came to pick you up
and take you to the funeral.

10:53.654 --> 10:57.825
Where the fuck you been, you fat bastard?
You took any longer, I'd be dead, too!

10:57.908 --> 11:00.244
Shit, good thing you know
how to handle him.

11:00.328 --> 11:02.330
Would you like to ride shotgun?

11:03.247 --> 11:04.373
<i>Stop the game, all right?</i>

11:04.457 --> 11:07.001
...take this missile in your ass.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.711
<i>- Listen.</i>
- Yes, the pills. I have them.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.796
- They're right here.
<i>- All right, cool. Can I come and get them?</i>

11:10.880 --> 11:13.966
- I have a funeral to go to. Shit!
<i>- Whatever. Man, I'll come over there.</i>

11:14.050 --> 11:15.551
- Fuck.
<i>- Did you try them?</i>

11:15.634 --> 11:17.345
No, no, I'm not gonna try them.
I made them.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.929
<i>But they're good, right? The stuff's good?</i>

11:19.013 --> 11:21.474
I got to go.
Never get high on your own supply.

11:21.557 --> 11:24.226
And, dude, this shit's gonna
blow your mind, I guarantee it.

11:24.310 --> 11:27.271
You'll love it. All right, got to go. Bye.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.525
Do you always open the door half naked?

11:31.609 --> 11:33.819
Come on, Jeff, we're gonna be late.

11:33.903 --> 11:35.404
All I got to do is just put some pants on.

11:35.488 --> 11:38.866
And this is my house, so...
You all right, man?

11:39.992 --> 11:42.495
- He's fine. He's just freaking out.
- Is he okay?

11:42.578 --> 11:46.165
- A car almost ran into us, and I was yelling.
- And this guy just jumped right in our lane.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.708
- I didn't see him.
- He did, he totally did.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.668
- I'm sorry, baby, I...
- No, baby, it's fine. It's fine, okay?

11:49.752 --> 11:51.837
You guys are funny.
Hey, what do you think?

11:51.921 --> 11:52.963
- Yes, no?
- No.

11:53.047 --> 11:55.966
- Go put on your pants, please.
- All right.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.052
And make sure they're black, Jeffrey!

11:58.135 --> 11:59.595
Okay, Mom.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.640
- I'm so hungry.
- God, my heart is racing.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.267
I don't know what's wrong with me.

12:07.728 --> 12:11.899
Oh, here. Take this one.
It'll calm you down. Jeff won't mind.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.526
What do you mean, take one of those?
What is that?

12:13.609 --> 12:17.696
It's Valium. I used to take it all the time.
It's gonna make you feel better, I promise.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.407
- Valium, are you sure?
- Yeah.

12:19.490 --> 12:20.574
- Yes.
- You know, I shouldn't be taking

12:20.658 --> 12:21.700
someone else's pills, right?

12:21.784 --> 12:23.786
- No, it's okay.
- I got to drive and...

12:23.869 --> 12:29.208
Babe, I'll drive. All right?
Just open wide. There we go. Take...

12:30.626 --> 12:32.711
Let's do this.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.674
- Oh, my keys.
- Jeff, you're wearing sneakers?

12:36.757 --> 12:38.509
- They're black, Elaine.
- But they're sneakers, Jeff.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.219
Is he gonna be any less dead
if I'm not wearing sneakers?

12:40.302 --> 12:43.514
- Forget it. Let's just go. Can I just...
- No, I got it.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.807
Okay.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.812
- Come on, Jeff.
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.856
- We're waiting.
- Oh, shoot!

12:54.191 --> 12:56.610
I still can't believe he's gone.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.990
You can't understand death
until you've given life.

13:01.907 --> 13:06.328
- Hey, Mama.
- Ryan, my baby!

13:06.412 --> 13:07.663
Hey.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.876
Mama, I know this is hard,
but it's gonna be okay,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.252
and we're gonna get through it.

13:13.335 --> 13:17.381
Oh, Ryan, you always know
exactly what to say, always!

13:17.465 --> 13:19.758
I guess if people died every week,
we'd see you all the time.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.344
- Hey, big bro. How you doing?
- Holding up.

13:22.428 --> 13:24.555
- How was your flight, Ryan?
- It was okay.

13:24.638 --> 13:29.059
But I had to buy the seat next to me.
I just can't do the small talk any more.

13:29.143 --> 13:33.939
And while I'm sitting there, up in first class,
they march all the broke people through.

13:34.023 --> 13:38.777
And a couple of them eyeballing me,
mad because I'm snacking on warm nuts.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.782
So I'm like, "Take your broke,
no-nuts ass to the back of the plane."

13:43.866 --> 13:46.535
Plus, there was tons of turbulence,

13:46.619 --> 13:49.079
but I guess that's the thing
about flying first class.

13:49.163 --> 13:55.503
No matter how much you pay, if the
plane crashes, you still end up dead.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.135
- End up dead!
- I'll make sure she's okay.

14:03.219 --> 14:05.596
- Please.
- End up dead!

14:06.722 --> 14:08.432
You always know just what to say.

14:08.516 --> 14:09.934
My bad.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.230
Hey. I love it when you come
to family functions, man.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.357
Because Dad takes his pure hate out on you.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.943
- Jeff.
- I'm joking. Oscar.

14:20.236 --> 14:21.695
You okay?

14:22.613 --> 14:23.906
Was there a dog in here just now?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.574
- What?
- What?

14:26.367 --> 14:29.703
Like a Dalmatian or a Schnauzer?

14:29.787 --> 14:33.457
- Honey, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.

14:35.167 --> 14:39.630
It's just a shame that somebody
has to die to get the family together.

14:40.005 --> 14:44.301
It was hard to see Dad like this.
He's in a better place now, right?

14:44.385 --> 14:47.346
- He was sick a long time.
- Since when does dead beat sick?

14:47.429 --> 14:51.475
You know what I mean. This is why
I try not to get close to people.

14:51.559 --> 14:54.728
- Too much emotion involved.
- Guess that's why you never call.

14:54.812 --> 14:58.065
Some families see each other all the time,
some meet up at funerals.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.233
That's just us.

14:59.316 --> 15:04.905
Hey, listen, I know this is a bad time,
but I'm gonna need that money.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.032
- Shit.
- We're splitting these costs, right?

15:07.116 --> 15:09.410
Okay. But I don't have it right now.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.161
What the fuck you mean,
you don't have it right now?

15:11.245 --> 15:13.497
You just bought a first class ticket
for your toothbrush.

15:13.581 --> 15:15.916
I don't have any cash. Honest.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.210
I lost a lot of shit when
the market collapsed.

15:18.294 --> 15:20.588
So, if you don't mind,
we gonna have to discuss this later.

15:20.671 --> 15:24.842
- No, no, no, no, let's discuss this right now.
- Hey, you mind?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.510
I'm grieving.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.972
Look at all these cars.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.933
You got to get to these funerals early.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.646
Come on. There's nowhere to park.

15:37.730 --> 15:41.191
- What? There's a spot right there. Grab it.
- That looks like it's too close to the corner.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.278
- Nah. You can wedge it in there. Grab it.
- I don't need a ticket today.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.946
You're not gonna get a ticket.
Would you just...

15:46.030 --> 15:48.574
You're gonna lose it. Grab it.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.994
Norman! Come on. Now, see?

15:55.331 --> 15:57.791
Elaine! I was gonna park there.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.918
Oh, I'm sorry, Norman. Are you family?

16:00.002 --> 16:02.421
- No, but I'm like family.
- Oh, honey, there's no such thing.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.423
- Elaine.
- Oh, God.

16:04.506 --> 16:05.591
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

16:05.674 --> 16:06.800
Well, your father invited me.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.802
Thought you might need
a real shoulder to cry on.

16:08.886 --> 16:12.097
- Oh, please. Come on. Oscar.
- Who the fuck's that?

16:12.181 --> 16:14.683
He... Come on, honey. We're here.

16:15.601 --> 16:18.312
- You all right?
- Come on.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.855
We there?

16:20.773 --> 16:23.859
- Yeah.
- Damn. I got Uncle Russell.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.361
How could I forget about Uncle Russell?

16:25.444 --> 16:28.906
I said what's happening?
What the hell is going on?

16:30.324 --> 16:31.659
What the fuck's this guy doing?

16:31.742 --> 16:35.245
It's very green here, isn't it?
It's, like, so green.

16:35.371 --> 16:39.208
Like, God, wow, it's like...
It's like I'm inside a lime.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.003
- Oscar?
- Yes?

16:43.087 --> 16:44.463
- Look at me.
- Okay.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.548
Hi. Are you all right?

16:46.632 --> 16:47.883
Yeah, why?

16:47.966 --> 16:50.135
All this stuff about dogs
and things being green.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.887
What's going on?

16:52.763 --> 16:56.767
What are you talking about?
I'm fine. I've never been greener.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.230
Jeff, look at this.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.650
- Hello.
- What's wrong with Oscar?

17:04.733 --> 17:06.359
- I don't know.
- You guys keep playing.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.195
Oh, my God. It's the Valium.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.241
- Valium?
- I'm in the band.

17:12.324 --> 17:13.992
I gave him one of your Valium.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.747
He's probably not used to it.

17:19.248 --> 17:22.417
- Yeah, right.
- I know you were looking.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.300
Where's he going?

17:30.926 --> 17:32.469
- Oscar!
- Shit.

17:35.139 --> 17:37.433
- You're going the wrong way, dumb-ass!
- That hurts!

17:37.516 --> 17:39.309
- Stop the car, Norman.
- What?

17:39.393 --> 17:41.478
Stop the car! I'm getting out.
I got to talk to her.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.147
I got to speak to Elaine. Stop the car.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.356
What about Uncle Russell?

17:44.440 --> 17:45.566
- I need you to help...
- Where are we?

17:45.649 --> 17:47.860
- We're gonna be late, fattie!
- Damn it!

17:47.943 --> 17:50.446
Uncle Russell, you hit me in my splotch.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.782
You got to stop this, Uncle Russell,
or you gonna be in a box next.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.077
- Hey, how you doing? All right.
- Thank you.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.538
Who are these people?
I don't recognise half of them.

17:59.621 --> 18:03.167
It's your family. You don't recognise
them from the last funeral?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.335
What side of the family is he on?

18:05.419 --> 18:07.087
Probably a friend of Dad's from work.

18:07.171 --> 18:10.090
You know, the funeral looks good.
You did a good job.

18:10.174 --> 18:12.509
No, we did a good job.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.138
Are you telling me I got to pay
for the whole funeral?

18:16.221 --> 18:18.849
I'm saying you gonna have to pay
for the whole thing now.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.019
All right, just for a few months,
till I get my next advance.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.354
What am I, a damn credit union?

18:24.438 --> 18:27.775
Goddamn, man! What the fuck?
Jesus Christ!

18:28.776 --> 18:31.612
Hello, boys. How you holding up?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.155
We're doing pretty good.

18:33.238 --> 18:36.241
We just got to wait for a few more people
to come and then we can start.

18:36.325 --> 18:38.619
Have you met my brother, Ryan?

18:38.702 --> 18:40.662
The writer? Oh, man!

18:42.539 --> 18:44.291
You know, I got to tell you,

18:44.374 --> 18:48.128
I squeezed this job in today
because I really wanted to meet you.

18:48.212 --> 18:51.423
Listen, I just finished reading
<i>Momma's Secret.</i>

18:53.509 --> 18:54.551
But, listen, that'll be our little secret,

18:54.635 --> 18:56.845
because I'm not supposed to
be reading that kind of stuff, you know?

18:56.929 --> 18:59.139
Right. Well, I'm sure the
Lord'll forgive you.

18:59.223 --> 19:02.935
- I can't wait to hear your eulogy.
- Actually, I'm doing the eulogy.

19:03.018 --> 19:06.814
- Oh, I thought...
- Well, Aaron's the oldest, technically.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.525
Really?

19:12.820 --> 19:16.615
- How's my little Cynthia?
- Oh, Duncan.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.535
Oh, look at you.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.663
I'm just trying to hold it all together.

19:23.038 --> 19:28.836
He was a good husband and a great father
to two healthy, strong boys.

19:28.919 --> 19:32.840
Why they have decided not to have
children of their own

19:32.923 --> 19:34.424
is beyond me.
- Cynthia.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.468
Can I get you some coffee?

19:36.552 --> 19:41.598
Coffee may do many things, Michelle,
but it does not bring back the dead.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.225
Tea?

19:56.572 --> 19:57.698
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yeah.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.033
I got to go over the speech.
Could you look out for Uncle Russell?

20:00.117 --> 20:02.411
Look at Martina.
Man, that girl is all grown up.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.330
Come on, man. Little Martina?
She's, like, in the 12th grade.

20:05.414 --> 20:10.043
Yeah, well, she may be in 12th grade,
but that ass is in grad school.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.178
- Anyway...
- I should go see how she's doing.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.806
You know, that's just being neighbourly.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.349
Yeah, you just do that.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.936
- See if she needs a juice box or something.
- Man!

20:34.276 --> 20:38.280
"My father was an exceptional man.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.783
- "He was born in 19..."
- 1938.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.038
Hi, there, Aaron.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.165
Hi. How's it going?

20:48.248 --> 20:52.377
I'm so sorry to hear about your dad.
He talked about you a lot.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.964
Did he ever mention me? I'm sorry. Frank.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.259
Not really.

20:59.343 --> 21:02.054
Honey. Can I see you for a moment?

21:02.387 --> 21:05.265
One second. I got to go, Frank.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.935
Thanks for coming, though.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.146
Be careful with my shit!
Don't bang up the rims.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.398
Hurry up now! We're late!

21:13.482 --> 21:17.486
Listen, we still need to finish that thing,
remember?

21:17.569 --> 21:19.488
Oh, come on, baby,
I'm just not in the mood right now.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.865
I'm not wearing any panties.

21:23.033 --> 21:27.871
- Hey, my father's dead. Put some panties on.
- I'm trying to help here.

21:27.955 --> 21:31.124
Please, honey, I really wanna make this
baby thing happen, so, come on.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.876
- We've got five minutes.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.212
- What?
- Don't... Don't... Don't stare.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.881
There's a guy down there...
Don't look, don't look.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.300
...in a black leather jacket who keeps
checking me out.

21:40.384 --> 21:41.760
All right, okay, I see him. What?

21:41.843 --> 21:43.679
- Don't stare, don't stare.
- I'm not staring.

21:43.762 --> 21:45.180
You recognise him?

21:45.263 --> 21:49.184
Well, no, but, I mean,
he must be a friend of your father's.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.353
Now I got to go and check the food.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.314
Hey! Put some panties on
before you touch the food.

21:54.398 --> 21:55.857
Big ones.

22:08.912 --> 22:12.082
- Look! Look.
- But, you know, he's in a better place.

22:12.165 --> 22:15.669
Isn't it beautiful? Plus, it sings.

22:21.591 --> 22:24.177
- Yep. It's right there.
- I'll see you inside.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.929
- It's right there.
- It's the Bee Gees.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.016
- Sounding great. Elaine.
- Thank you so much for coming.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.184
- Hi, inside, yes. What?
- Listen, listen, listen, listen.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.103
- Okay. I got to tell you something, all right?
- Okay.

22:33.186 --> 22:37.399
And I'm just warning you right now
that you're not gonna like it.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.110
Aaron.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.779
- Uncle Duncan.
- How are we doing on time?

22:42.863 --> 22:45.866
You know what, as soon as
Russell gets here, we'll be ready to go.

22:45.949 --> 22:50.454
Fine. So, what's this nonsense
I hear about Ryan not saying a few words?

22:50.579 --> 22:54.082
I offered to do the eulogy,
but Aaron's the oldest.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.252
I'm sure it's gonna be one of a kind.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.963
It's a real shame.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.467
I mean, I'm sure you'll do fine, Aaron, but
with Ryan being the writer in the family.

23:03.592 --> 23:05.302
You know, I'm a writer, too.

23:05.385 --> 23:09.306
Well, we all write cheques.
Your brother is an author.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.558
Excuse me?

23:11.641 --> 23:13.393
Uncle Duncan, I have to ask you a question.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.145
- Okay.
- Martina.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.272
Little Martina?

23:17.773 --> 23:21.234
Well, she's not actually related to us
or anything, is she?

23:21.318 --> 23:23.487
No. No, no, no. She's just a family friend.

23:23.612 --> 23:24.988
Oh, good, good.

23:27.324 --> 23:31.495
- What do you mean, it's not Valium?
- Well, it's interesting.

23:31.578 --> 23:35.665
What you thought was Valium
is actually not Valium.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.335
- Yikes.
- What is it, Jeff?

23:39.336 --> 23:41.088
It's like a hallucinogenic.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.423
- Mescaline, acid, Special K.
- What?

23:43.507 --> 23:45.425
Served up in a little pill bottle.

23:45.509 --> 23:49.262
- Oh, my God. This isn't funny.
- No, it's not, it's not funny at all.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.098
- Look at him. Look at him.
- Oh, my God.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.265
- He's high as a kite.
- What...

23:52.349 --> 23:53.517
The man is clearly high.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.185
What are you doing
with this stuff in the house?

23:55.310 --> 23:57.270
I'm a pharmacology student, Laney.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.689
And first of all, who just waltzes up
in someone's apartment

23:59.773 --> 24:00.857
and just starts popping pills?

24:00.982 --> 24:03.026
- Well, I thought it was Valium.
- Clearly.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.694
What should I do? Should I tell him?

24:04.778 --> 24:07.114
No, no, no. That'll just freak him out.

24:07.197 --> 24:09.699
- Okay. Okay.
- You know, this is gonna be fine. Okay?

24:09.825 --> 24:12.619
Don't let him spend too much time
talking to any one person.

24:12.702 --> 24:15.539
- Okay, okay.
- Or bush.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.374
He's in a bush right now.

24:17.457 --> 24:22.045
Okay, Oscar? Honey. Come back.
Where are you going?

24:22.170 --> 24:23.547
Jeffrey, help me.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.632
Oscar. Oscar.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.134
Oh, man.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.137
Help me! My groin.

24:30.554 --> 24:33.974
It's gonna be your head in a minute.
Hurry up, we gonna be late for the funeral.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.226
My scrotum is gonna look like a duffle bag

24:36.309 --> 24:38.645
with two bowling balls in it
when I get up this hill with you.

24:38.728 --> 24:39.896
That's what your brain is.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.900
Fuck.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.237
Hey.

24:51.408 --> 24:53.160
Oscar. Oscar.

24:54.578 --> 24:56.371
Oh, Dad. Hi.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.916
How are you?

25:00.041 --> 25:03.086
Not too bad,
considering we're at my brother's funeral.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.005
- Yes, yes, we are.
- Hey, Pop.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.673
- Hey.
- How you doing? You look good.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.091
How're they treating you over there
at Pepperdine?

25:08.175 --> 25:10.427
Good. You know, don't worry about me.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.512
- I'm not worried about you.
- Oscar.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.431
Good. Oscar, Oscar.

25:16.725 --> 25:21.104
- So, I see you brought your friend.
- He's not my friend, he's my boyfriend.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.940
Doctor! Good to see you.

25:24.024 --> 25:27.277
- I'm extremely sorry, sir.
- Derek. Glad you could make it.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.696
Thank you. Elaine. Hello.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.032
So, how's everything going
with my portfolio?

25:32.115 --> 25:34.701
Could not be better, sir.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.037
In fact, we should get together
and play a round of golf

25:37.120 --> 25:39.372
and I'll tell you all about
it, every last detail.

25:39.456 --> 25:41.291
- Happily.
- Great.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.043
- Maybe Elaine would join us.
- Wonderful.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.961
Make it a threesome.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.423
- Elaine!
- Oh, Aunt Cynthia.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.800
I'm so sorry about Uncle Edward.

25:50.884 --> 25:54.304
- We're gonna miss him so much.
- And Jeff, sneakers.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.306
He bought them for me.
He bought them for me.

25:56.431 --> 25:59.309
Oh, gosh. Aunt Cynthia, this is Oscar.

26:00.477 --> 26:02.979
I'm so sorry about the death.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.148
- Oh, it's okay.
- Sorry.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.778
<i>Amazing grace...</i>

26:11.446 --> 26:15.909
<i>How sweet the sound, yeah!</i>

26:17.911 --> 26:23.250
<i>That saved a wretch like...</i>

26:34.302 --> 26:35.637
Very nice to see both of you.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.349
- It's nice to see you, too, Aunt Cynthia.
- So sorry, ma'am, so sorry.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.851
- Dad, Dad.
- Cynthia.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.813
- Okay, so we need a plan.
- Yes, we do.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.022
What is he doing?

26:46.147 --> 26:48.525
- I love you.
- Oh, God.

26:49.901 --> 26:50.986
Oh, my God.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.530
Come on! Push, you pussy. Lard-ass.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.908
- Did you just fart, old man?
- Put your butt in it.

27:03.206 --> 27:05.041
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.169
I heard about the engagement, Elaine.

27:08.545 --> 27:11.423
- How did you...
- Yeah, I did.

27:11.548 --> 27:14.342
You know, I can't deal with you today.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.510
Oh, don't.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.387
But I have not told my dad yet,

27:17.512 --> 27:20.974
and I would appreciate it
if you kept your mouth shut.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.268
Okay. I'll do that for you.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.895
What is he looking...

27:33.570 --> 27:35.405
- Hey, Elaine, I... Could I...
- Oscar?

27:35.530 --> 27:38.366
- Hey, baby.
- You didn't even let me finish.

27:38.450 --> 27:41.077
My father was an exceptional man.

27:41.202 --> 27:45.081
He was born in 1938.

27:45.582 --> 27:49.169
1938 was an exceptional year. In 1938...

27:49.252 --> 27:54.382
Actually, there is something I'd like
to talk to you about, if you have a minute.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.717
Yeah, sure.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.887
Quit crying. You got snot all over
my collar and everything.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.263
Man, not stairs.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.974
What's wrong with the stairs?
Just get me up the stairs. Hurry up!

28:03.099 --> 28:04.851
I got to take your old ass up these stairs?

28:04.934 --> 28:07.062
Yeah, you got to take my old ass
up these stairs.

28:07.145 --> 28:09.856
- So, you go to a lot of funerals?
- No, this is my first one.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.609
I want our wedding to be like this.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.195
You might meet the man of your
dreams at this one, huh?

28:15.278 --> 28:17.155
Got to go to a funeral
and I got a cry-baby here.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.740
Come on.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.242
This is a bit delicate.

28:21.326 --> 28:24.079
When they gave out brains, man,
they left yours in the elevator, shit!

28:24.162 --> 28:25.205
You know what, can this wait?

28:25.288 --> 28:28.416
I think my uncle just got here,
and we're running a little late.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.251
- Sure. It's fine.
- Do something, man!

28:30.335 --> 28:31.628
Thanks a lot.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.005
Told you about breathing on my neck, too.
Come on.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.383
Hey, I got it. Sit down. I got it.
You all right?

28:36.466 --> 28:37.926
- I'm seeing double.
- Just sit down.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.803
- Is that you, Derek?
- Sit down.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.222
Hey, old-timer, how are you?

28:42.305 --> 28:43.598
Hey, thanks a lot, thanks a lot.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.225
- I need something to drink.
- Okay, thanks again. Yeah.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.559
- Come on, Norman.
- Some Gatorade.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.312
- Get up.
- I got to get my electrolytes up.

28:49.437 --> 28:52.690
Could you kindly take your seats?
We'd like to begin the service.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.901
- Watch out now.
- Okay.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.822
Watch out now. Watch out now. I'm family.

28:58.947 --> 29:02.033
God damn it. You got old people here.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.120
- Hey.
- Nice legs there.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.249
Family and friends,

29:09.332 --> 29:14.003
we are gathered here to mourn
the passing of a fine man...

29:14.796 --> 29:17.340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.092
...Edward Barnes.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.553
Now, I'd like to begin...

29:21.678 --> 29:24.681
Elaine, I know you don't think
I'm part of this family.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.599
Because you're not, so be quiet.

29:26.683 --> 29:30.520
Yeah, but when you dissed me back there,
I had Uncle Russell with me in the car.

29:30.645 --> 29:35.024
You took my parking space.
I had to push him up a hill by myself.

29:35.150 --> 29:36.860
We almost missed the service.

29:36.985 --> 29:40.697
Norman, you poke me one more time,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.032
Threats, threats.

29:45.577 --> 29:48.705
- What's going on?
- She took my parking spot, Aaron.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.708
Parking spot? My father's dead. Act right.

29:53.877 --> 29:58.298
"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant,
because he loved him as his own soul.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.925
"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe
that was upon him,

30:01.050 --> 30:03.136
"and gave it to David, and his garments,

30:03.219 --> 30:07.015
"even to his sword, and to his bow,
and to his girdle."

30:13.062 --> 30:18.735
And now we'll hear a word from
Edward's son, Aaron, Ryan's older brother.

30:19.903 --> 30:24.032
Only by a couple of months.
We was actually born the same year.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.701
No fault of yours, Mama.

30:32.582 --> 30:35.168
- Last chance.
- I got it. I got it.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.587
Daddy's only gonna die once.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.424
Good afternoon.

30:41.549 --> 30:43.134
Or I guess just afternoon,

30:43.259 --> 30:46.262
I mean, it couldn't possibly be that good.

30:47.931 --> 30:51.434
My father was an exceptional man.

30:52.435 --> 30:55.772
And he was born in 1938,

30:57.649 --> 30:59.651
an exceptional year.

30:59.776 --> 31:04.697
In 1938, the number one song
was <i>Shortnin' Bread.</i>

31:05.782 --> 31:08.117
Some of you might remember it.

31:09.827 --> 31:13.665
<i>Mama's little baby love
shortnin', shortnin'</i>

31:13.790 --> 31:17.794
<i>Mama's little baby love
shortnin' bread</i>

31:19.837 --> 31:25.677
Also in 1938, <i>Time</i> magazine's
Man of the Year was Adolf Hitler.

31:27.178 --> 31:30.014
I bet you they wished
they could have that one back.

31:30.139 --> 31:33.268
One thing my father loved to do
was watch the Discovery Channel.

31:33.351 --> 31:36.896
I guess you could call my mother
a real "Shark Week" widow.

31:36.980 --> 31:41.568
Anything to do with sharks
or wild boar or the dung beetle,

31:41.651 --> 31:43.653
this always fascinated him.
- Did you just see that?

31:43.736 --> 31:45.154
- He really loved <i>The Golden Girls.</i>
- See what?

31:45.238 --> 31:46.698
Blanche, Dorothy, and Rose.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.408
- That coffin just moved.
- He especially loved it

31:48.491 --> 31:51.369
when <i>The Golden Girls</i> were syndicated...
- No, no, no.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.496
- Elaine.
- ...it was on at least three times a day.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.832
And sometimes I'd say,
"Dad, you wanna go out?" And he'd go...

31:55.915 --> 31:57.667
He's alive. There's
something alive in there.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.211
- No, there's not...
- You have to tell, someone's moving...

32:00.336 --> 32:01.754
The coffin's moving. I'm sorry.

32:01.838 --> 32:03.756
- There's somebody in there.
- No, Oscar, sit. Please.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.425
It's moving. I just saw it move.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.343
- Someone's alive in there, trying to get out.
- Need some help?

32:07.427 --> 32:08.469
- No, can't you see it?
- I'm fine.

32:08.553 --> 32:10.555
What the hell is wrong with you people?
The coffin's moving.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.015
Oscar, sit down.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.100
- No, I just need to show you, he's alive.
- Elaine, do something.

32:14.183 --> 32:16.060
No, no, I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna show you. No, no.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.730
- Get away from there.
- Oscar!

32:20.023 --> 32:22.233
- Oh, my God. Ryan! No! No!
- Do something!

32:22.358 --> 32:23.693
Hey! Hey!

32:34.370 --> 32:35.538
The body!

32:36.122 --> 32:39.208
- Cynthia! Cynthia!
- Mama.

32:39.584 --> 32:41.711
No, I'm gonna help, I got to help him.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.172
- No, no!
- Wait a minute! Wait!

32:44.255 --> 32:45.923
He's gonna die!

32:47.925 --> 32:50.970
Aaron, you the oldest.
Go see what the fuck is going on.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.096
Okay, I will.

32:52.388 --> 32:53.556
Hey!

32:54.265 --> 32:55.475
Jeff.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.018
I'm not all the way comfortable with this.

32:57.101 --> 32:58.770
Come on!

32:58.895 --> 33:00.396
I'm too old for this shit.

33:00.938 --> 33:04.651
- When is this funeral gonna happen?
- It's gonna happen later, honey.

33:04.734 --> 33:07.737
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- I just...

33:07.820 --> 33:09.280
- Oh, my God.
- Hey!

33:09.405 --> 33:11.407
- What the fuck was that?
- Aaron.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.618
- No, no.
- Aaron, I'm so sorry.

33:13.743 --> 33:15.828
- You need to understand that this is...
- You sorry? You sorry?

33:15.912 --> 33:19.290
My father's sprawled out on the floor
like fucking Screamin' Jay Hawkins,

33:19.415 --> 33:21.417
but it's okay, because you're sorry!
- I'm so...

33:21.501 --> 33:23.002
- The coffin was moving. I...
- Is he talking to me?

33:23.086 --> 33:24.462
- Talking to me?
- Oscar. Oscar, honey, shut up.

33:24.587 --> 33:25.713
- You talking to me?
- Please, for a second.

33:25.797 --> 33:29.050
No, he's not talking to you.
Listen to me, Aaron. Go back inside.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.677
Aaron, no. I will explain later.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.262
Yeah, yeah, can make it up to me
at my father's next funeral!

33:33.346 --> 33:34.514
- Baby.
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:34.597 --> 33:36.307
I will not have sex with you right now!

33:36.432 --> 33:39.143
- I wasn't going to ask you that.
- I'm sorry, what were you gonna ask me?

33:39.268 --> 33:40.603
- Is everything okay?
- No.

33:40.687 --> 33:41.771
- You just...
- No.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.773
- Michelle, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.025
- I'm gonna kill him. I'll kill him.
- It's okay.

33:46.109 --> 33:47.944
You fucking moron!

33:48.027 --> 33:50.863
- Dad, Dad! Leave it alone, please, please!
- Leave it alone?

33:50.947 --> 33:53.783
I can't believe you brought this maniac.
I never want to see him again.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.661
This isn't what Oscar's normally like,
you know that.

33:56.786 --> 33:58.413
He just took some medication and he's...

33:58.496 --> 34:00.206
- Medication?
- I gave him a Valium

34:00.289 --> 34:03.584
and he's having a very bad reaction to it.
- Valium? That is not a Valium high.

34:03.668 --> 34:07.130
Your mother was on Valium for 40 years
and she never knocked over a coffin.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.257
- Dad, stop it.
- This is not over.

34:09.340 --> 34:12.467
You're gonna pay for that, I promise you!

34:15.304 --> 34:17.639
- Thanks, Jeff.
- No problem, cuz.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.811
People, allow me to extend my apologies.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.731
But everything is now being
put back into its proper place,

34:24.813 --> 34:26.858
so, please, enjoy the refreshments.

34:26.983 --> 34:29.277
The catfish nuggets are to die for.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.820
We'll let you know
when we're ready to continue.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.906
Let's just burn him and get it over with.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.409
- I'm gonna go have a smoke.
- All right.

34:38.578 --> 34:41.664
Hey. That must have been horrible for you.

34:43.331 --> 34:46.085
Maybe we should go outside, get some air?

34:46.168 --> 34:49.672
Hey, bigshot. I read your last book there.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.300
<i>- Black Hurt.</i>
- That's cool. Thanks, Uncle Russ.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.887
I'm not giving you a compliment,
you arrogant bastard.

34:56.012 --> 34:59.849
What a load of bullshit.
I wouldn't wipe my ass with it.

35:01.851 --> 35:05.605
- Hey, Aaron. Yo, you all right, man?
- I'm holding up.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.064
Yeah. That was heavy-duty,

35:07.190 --> 35:09.567
the way your father
fell out his coffin like a dead fish.

35:09.692 --> 35:13.696
He was like... I was like, "Damn!" Man.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.323
Not now, Norman.

35:15.406 --> 35:16.949
- I got to go somewhere, okay?
- You're right. I'm sorry.

35:17.033 --> 35:20.203
Hey, Aaron. But, you know, it's just scary.

35:20.703 --> 35:24.248
You never know when your room
is gonna be ready. You never know.

35:24.373 --> 35:26.083
When your room is ready,
your room is ready.

35:26.209 --> 35:28.961
And I'm like scared
because I got this rash on my wrist,

35:29.045 --> 35:31.380
and I don't know
where it's coming from and...

35:31.464 --> 35:32.507
I know it ain't Chlamydia.

35:32.590 --> 35:35.593
I know what that look like, but this is
something different and I'm just scared.

35:35.676 --> 35:38.596
- I don't know, man.
- Well, just show it to Uncle Duncan.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.223
He's a doctor.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.892
You know something,
Uncle Duncan, you're right.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.853
Maybe we're standing still
and the coffin's moving.

35:45.937 --> 35:47.230
- No, no, it's not...
- No, nothing...

35:47.313 --> 35:48.856
Listen to me, the coffin moved.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.441
- I saw it move.
- No, Oscar, it wasn't...

35:50.525 --> 35:53.861
- God, Elaine, am I losing my mind?
- No, you're not losing your mind, honey.

35:53.945 --> 35:58.157
- Why are my hands so big?
- Oscar. Look at me. Focus.

35:58.241 --> 36:00.368
Elaine, I love this game.

36:00.451 --> 36:03.579
Okay, good.
Because I have to tell you something.

36:03.663 --> 36:05.790
Okay. What is it, my love?

36:07.208 --> 36:10.503
Remember that Valium
that I gave you earlier?

36:11.212 --> 36:12.421
Yes.

36:12.797 --> 36:17.134
Well, it turns out that it wasn't
really Valium. Not completely.

36:18.970 --> 36:22.098
- Did you just hear me?
- Hello? Hello?

36:22.890 --> 36:24.851
- Am I going blind in here?
- Oh, God.

36:24.934 --> 36:26.227
I promise.

36:26.310 --> 36:30.189
Hey, Uncle Duncan! Miss Cynthia, Michelle.

36:31.065 --> 36:33.150
I got this thing on my hand
and it's been there for weeks,

36:33.234 --> 36:36.237
and I was just wondering
what you think it might be.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.697
I'm not...

36:38.406 --> 36:40.825
Look, you probably should see
a dermatologist, Norman.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.077
- I'm going out to get some air.
- Okay.

36:43.160 --> 36:46.789
I mean... Why? I don't have
sickle cell anaemia or nothing, right?

36:46.873 --> 36:49.500
No, it looks like a pigment mutation.

36:49.584 --> 36:50.877
A pigment mutation?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.670
You mean like the Incredible Hulk
or something?

36:52.753 --> 36:54.171
I can't be turning green out there.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.341
I'm a black man, I'm sensitive, I'd be
turning green over every little thing.

36:57.425 --> 36:58.551
I can see it now.

36:58.634 --> 37:02.346
Me getting mail from child support,
"That not Hulk baby.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.515
"Hulk take blood tests on Maury Povich."

37:04.599 --> 37:09.270
You're probably just allergic to something.
Maybe shellfish or nuts.

37:09.562 --> 37:14.233
- Nuts? Well, what nut mutates?
- I don't know. Now excuse me.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.986
Somebody gave me hypoallergenic drugs?

37:17.069 --> 37:19.906
- It's a form of hallucinogenic.
- Hagucilenic.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.408
- Elaine, Elaine, did you tell him?
- I just did.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.076
- How you feeling, big guy?
- I've been drugged.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.286
Yeah, not, no, yeah.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.997
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit. Hey, listen...
- I've been drugged by you.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.416
- You fool!
- Wait, Oscar!

37:30.499 --> 37:32.960
- Let him go! Oh, my God.
- How long does it last?

37:33.044 --> 37:34.337
Elaine, he's incredibly strong right now.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.880
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- How long does it last?

37:35.963 --> 37:38.758
- Like eight hours?
- Eight hours, fuck!

37:38.841 --> 37:41.302
Babe, what are you doing?

37:41.385 --> 37:43.262
I'm gonna be sick.

37:43.346 --> 37:46.933
- Jeffrey, this is all your fault.
- This is your fault. You gave it to him.

37:47.016 --> 37:48.267
Shit.

37:49.769 --> 37:51.520
Baby, slow down.

37:53.147 --> 37:54.315
Hey, Elaine. What's going on?

37:54.398 --> 37:56.108
- What are you doing? You following me?
- Not now, Derek!

37:56.192 --> 37:57.360
Hey!

37:57.443 --> 38:00.571
- Sorry. You all right?
- Are you okay?

38:00.988 --> 38:03.032
- Oh, shit.
- Oscar!

38:03.115 --> 38:04.784
Excuse me, everyone, he's gonna be sick.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.619
Oscar, sweetie, slow down!

38:06.702 --> 38:08.788
- Oscar! Oscar!
- Oscar!

38:09.288 --> 38:12.583
Oscar, no! Don't go in there!
Oscar! Oscar, out!

38:13.250 --> 38:16.170
In here, there's a bathroom here. Oh, God.

38:18.047 --> 38:20.466
- Jeez! Oscar.
- Get back.

38:20.716 --> 38:22.093
What are you doing?

38:22.176 --> 38:24.053
Get back or I will blow your head off.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.262
- Get your hands up!
- Are you...

38:25.346 --> 38:26.681
Hands up!

38:28.057 --> 38:29.600
Oscar, baby.

38:31.018 --> 38:33.771
- Are you kidding me? Open this door, baby.
- Easy, big fellow.

38:33.854 --> 38:34.939
- Honey.
- Oh, shit.

38:35.022 --> 38:36.232
You're locked in, so, please,

38:36.315 --> 38:37.692
unlock the door, okay?
- Oh, shit.

38:37.775 --> 38:41.529
- Elaine? I can't find the pill bottle.
- Can you just...

38:44.073 --> 38:45.491
Oh, shit.

38:47.326 --> 38:50.746
- Oscar, open the door.
- Lasts up to eight hours.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.999
- Open the door.
- Perfect.

38:55.918 --> 39:00.715
- Oscar, open the door, sweetie.
- It's already been five minutes.

39:01.424 --> 39:03.467
- That's good.
- Damn it!

39:04.927 --> 39:08.681
Motherfucker! Five minutes? Oh, shit!

39:09.265 --> 39:12.977
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!
- What's going on?

39:13.060 --> 39:14.645
- Oscar, open the door, please.
- You know what,

39:14.729 --> 39:18.065
why don't you go get something to eat?
We're gonna start pretty soon. Yeah.

39:19.692 --> 39:23.320
Grief does strange things to people,
doesn't it?

39:23.612 --> 39:24.947
- Yeah.
- If you remember,

39:25.031 --> 39:27.158
there's something I would like
to talk to you about.

39:27.241 --> 39:30.828
- Could we just do this...
- Is there someplace private we could go?

39:30.911 --> 39:32.580
Cocksuckers!

39:35.499 --> 39:38.252
This is lovely.

39:39.879 --> 39:41.922
- So Edward.
- I know.

39:46.177 --> 39:48.679
You're writing a novel?

39:49.096 --> 39:51.432
Yeah, that's mine.

39:52.475 --> 39:54.935
- Sorry.
- Just like your brother.

39:55.394 --> 39:58.105
Actually, I was writing before my brother.

39:58.189 --> 40:03.402
I got a couple of pieces published in <i>Jet.</i>
One about hypertension.

40:04.070 --> 40:05.321
That was a while back, though,

40:05.404 --> 40:07.698
and now I'm working mainly
as a tax accountant.

40:07.782 --> 40:12.828
Well, then, you must be very proud of Ryan.
Getting all of his novels published.

40:12.912 --> 40:15.331
Yeah. Pretty proud.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.084
What did you wanna talk about?

40:18.167 --> 40:20.836
Your father and I were very close.

40:21.337 --> 40:24.757
- That's nice, that's nice.
- Spent a lot of time together.

40:24.840 --> 40:28.260
Okay, well, you know, Dad was a fun guy.

40:28.719 --> 40:33.599
I have some photos I want to show you.
Few snaps of us.

40:35.810 --> 40:39.313
That's me and your dad at
Venice Beach, Muscle Beach.

40:41.774 --> 40:45.027
And here we are in West Hollywood,
at the Halloween parade.

40:45.111 --> 40:48.948
I don't know if you've ever been,
but what a spectacle that is.

40:54.161 --> 40:55.538
Oscar.

40:58.165 --> 40:59.416
How'd you get in here?

40:59.500 --> 41:02.753
And here we are at the premiere
of <i>Dreamgirls.</i>

41:03.587 --> 41:07.508
I was dressed as Deena
and your father just had to be Effie.

41:10.302 --> 41:14.557
So, how exactly did you know my father?

41:31.198 --> 41:33.409
No. No.

41:35.161 --> 41:38.414
You think you can come in here
and just slander my dad's name

41:38.497 --> 41:41.876
by showing me a couple of pictures
of you guys going to see <i>Dreamgirls?</i>

41:41.959 --> 41:44.378
So what? I've seen <i>Dreamgirls</i>
two, three times.

41:44.461 --> 41:45.880
Doesn't mean I'm gay.

41:45.963 --> 41:50.259
<i>Steppin' to the bad side
Gonna be a mean ride</i>

41:50.342 --> 41:52.386
- What's that prove?
- I'm sorry.

41:52.469 --> 41:57.183
I guess he would've told you himself,
but he wasn't sure how you'd react.

41:57.266 --> 41:58.684
Does my mother know?

41:58.767 --> 42:01.478
No. And there's no reason she has to.

42:01.562 --> 42:04.481
Just as long as I get what's owed to me.

42:04.565 --> 42:08.485
Excuse me? What's owed to you?

42:08.569 --> 42:10.654
Well, I deserve something.

42:10.738 --> 42:14.366
Your father and I were lovers and he
left me absolutely nothing in his will.

42:14.450 --> 42:16.202
How do you think that makes me feel?

42:16.285 --> 42:18.954
I don't know and I don't care.

42:19.038 --> 42:22.374
I will tell you how it makes me feel.
Cheap.

42:24.335 --> 42:27.379
- Like some cheap piece of ass.
- What do you want?

42:27.463 --> 42:31.008
What I want is a lot,
but I'm not asking you for what I want.

42:31.091 --> 42:34.803
- I deserve $30,000.
- $30,000?

42:34.887 --> 42:38.766
Are you smoking meth?
I'm not giving you $30,000.

42:39.225 --> 42:41.101
I'm trying to buy a house!
I'm trying to have a kid!

42:41.185 --> 42:42.603
I can't give you $30,000!

42:42.686 --> 42:46.190
Now, listen, your father made me
a promise to take care of me.

42:46.273 --> 42:50.194
I made certain sacrifices
to keep him happy.

42:50.611 --> 42:53.906
Now, I don't want to, but I will
show these photos to your mother.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.659
Do you really want me to do that?

42:57.785 --> 42:58.911
Shit!

43:05.417 --> 43:06.919
Wait here.

43:10.214 --> 43:11.548
Okay.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.971
Oh, Aaron.
I was just telling George here how

43:17.054 --> 43:18.472
when we were boys together,

43:18.555 --> 43:21.976
your father used to make us
all go skinny-dipping.

43:22.851 --> 43:25.354
- Isn't that funny?
- Hilarious.

43:27.398 --> 43:30.776
- Well, maybe your husband will know.
- Wait! Wait! Aaron! Aaron!

43:32.152 --> 43:33.779
Sometime today?

43:33.862 --> 43:35.698
Anything I can do to help?

43:35.781 --> 43:38.033
No, I'm fine, thank you.

43:42.121 --> 43:43.455
Oscar, please.

43:43.539 --> 43:45.791
Say, Elaine, what are you doing
after the funeral?

43:45.874 --> 43:48.544
I got Usher tickets, front
row, Staples Center.

43:48.669 --> 43:49.795
You don't have Usher tickets.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.130
Well, no, not yet,
but I can get them like that.

43:51.213 --> 43:54.049
You know what? Derek, please, go away.

43:54.967 --> 43:56.885
You don't deserve her!

43:58.220 --> 43:59.680
He doesn't.

44:00.347 --> 44:02.141
I'm gonna go find Norman.

44:02.224 --> 44:03.892
So, you've never been to New York?

44:03.976 --> 44:06.395
I've been, with my parents once.

44:06.478 --> 44:10.733
Now, that's not seeing New York.
You got to come visit. Just hang out.

44:10.816 --> 44:13.986
- When's your birthday?
- I turned 18 last week.

44:17.740 --> 44:20.909
Yeah. Well, that's my
favourite number, girl.

44:22.036 --> 44:24.330
You know, I want you
to get yourself on a bus

44:24.413 --> 44:28.250
and come visit me in New York this year.
Can you do that?

44:28.334 --> 44:29.585
For me?

44:31.086 --> 44:33.339
All right. Yeah.

44:33.422 --> 44:37.426
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
And I got all kind of snacks for you.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.511
- Really?
- You like Sugar Daddies?

44:39.595 --> 44:41.347
- Ryan, Ryan, I need to talk to you.
- Gummi bears...

44:41.430 --> 44:43.015
- Ryan, I need to talk...
- Aaron, not now.

44:43.098 --> 44:46.435
- I really need to talk to you.
- Aaron, give me five minutes, okay?

44:46.560 --> 44:48.270
Bro, I'm grieving here.

44:48.354 --> 44:51.023
Martina, could you excuse us?
We've really got to talk about something.

44:51.106 --> 44:54.109
Hey, <i>SpongeBob</i> is on.
All right, talk to you later.

44:54.234 --> 44:56.028
What are you doing?

44:57.196 --> 45:00.783
Remember the guy that came by
a little earlier, that we didn't recognise?

45:00.908 --> 45:04.620
- Dude in the leather jacket.
- Yeah, well,

45:04.703 --> 45:08.457
he came by the study, and he showed me
some pictures of him and Dad.

45:08.582 --> 45:10.042
So? So, he showed you some pictures,

45:10.125 --> 45:14.630
what's wrong with that?
- Pictures of him and Dad together.

45:15.089 --> 45:19.718
- So, we playing 20 questions now or what?
- He was Dad's lover.

45:19.802 --> 45:24.223
- No, man. No, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy's name is Frank.

45:24.306 --> 45:27.935
He showed me some pictures
of him and Dad doing stuff.

45:29.228 --> 45:31.897
You telling me our father was
on the downlow?

45:31.980 --> 45:34.650
- Way down low.
- Hell no.

45:34.775 --> 45:37.486
I don't believe that. My father's not gay.

45:37.611 --> 45:40.572
Matter of fact, he's so straight,
he makes me seem gay.

45:40.656 --> 45:42.658
And I ain't fucking gay.

45:44.827 --> 45:45.994
Daddy!

45:47.663 --> 45:49.581
I ain't know he did yoga.

45:49.665 --> 45:51.917
Look. He got the wheelbarrow.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.420
- Thanks.
- I just don't get it.

45:54.503 --> 45:57.756
I don't know what she sees in that poser
that she doesn't see in me.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.717
- Seems serious, don't it?
- Of course it is, it's my life.

46:00.843 --> 46:03.137
I've only been sleeping
like eight hours a night, man.

46:03.220 --> 46:05.222
- I'm at my wit's end.
- What?

46:05.347 --> 46:06.640
- No, dude.
- Yeah?

46:06.723 --> 46:10.352
- Me. Pigment mutation?
- Right.

46:11.478 --> 46:16.442
Well, maybe it's vitiligo, that thing
Michael Jackson had on his balls.

46:16.525 --> 46:19.278
I don't know what Michael Jackson had
on his balls.

46:19.361 --> 46:20.612
- Okay.
- You asking me,

46:20.696 --> 46:23.323
like I was down there or something.

46:26.201 --> 46:29.663
- Hey. Try this cake. It might have nuts in it.
- So?

46:29.746 --> 46:32.249
Elaine's dad said I might just be allergic
to nuts.

46:32.374 --> 46:34.293
So, don't eat nuts.
Put the fork down. Don't eat it.

46:34.376 --> 46:36.336
That's what I do when I'm stressed. I eat.

46:36.420 --> 46:38.464
You ain't gonna eat
when your hand falls off, papa.

46:38.547 --> 46:41.425
Just try the cake for me.
See if it has nuts in it, please?

46:41.550 --> 46:44.887
Elaine's driving me crazy,
and you're not helping.

46:50.559 --> 46:55.564
Hey, fathead. Quit slopping down food
for a second. Make me a plate.

46:55.689 --> 46:58.484
I'm gonna wash my hands,
and make you a dynamite plate.

46:58.567 --> 47:01.403
I know you like hot sauce
on your collard greens. That's...

47:01.528 --> 47:03.238
Come here to papa.

47:05.532 --> 47:07.034
Uncle Russell.

47:07.117 --> 47:10.954
Have you seen a little pill,
pill bottle with some Valium in it?

47:13.457 --> 47:16.919
- Is that a yes or...
- God, don't scare me like that.

47:18.045 --> 47:20.923
Shit tastes like it got nuts in it. Shit.

47:21.423 --> 47:25.052
- I'm sure we'll start again soon.
- Dr Barnes! Dr Barnes!

47:25.135 --> 47:28.639
- Let's go back inside.
- Soon. I just need a moment alone.

47:28.764 --> 47:30.182
Just one minute.

47:30.265 --> 47:33.227
- Dr Barnes, just one quick...
- Excuse me.

47:37.231 --> 47:38.649
How you doing, Miss Cynthia?

47:38.774 --> 47:40.275
- You look good.
- Thank you.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.904
You hanging in there?
Your macaroni is superb.

47:43.987 --> 47:47.366
Six different cheeses.
He looked good in that box.

47:47.449 --> 47:50.494
The rigor mortis set in well.
You know, except for that left hand.

47:50.619 --> 47:53.580
You might just wanna throw an oven mitt
or something on there. Yeah.

47:53.664 --> 47:57.209
The suit he got on is
magnificent, you know.

47:57.292 --> 48:00.963
Looked like Colin Powell.
Looked just like a Republican.

48:02.464 --> 48:03.799
But did you check the shoes?

48:03.924 --> 48:08.220
'Cause sometimes they take the shoes right
off their feet in the funeral home, right?

48:08.303 --> 48:12.140
- Especially if they're gators.
- Norman. Just...

48:13.642 --> 48:15.394
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, Miss Cynthia.

48:15.477 --> 48:16.979
Jesus Christ!

48:21.608 --> 48:23.277
Somebody dropped they pills.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.572
If we don't get him the money right now,
he's gonna start showing Mom the pictures.

48:26.655 --> 48:30.033
- Let me think. All right? Let me think.
- Think, think.

48:30.158 --> 48:33.328
- You gonna have to pay him, then.
- That's your big idea?

48:33.412 --> 48:35.122
I'm gonna have to pay him?
Where's your money?

48:35.205 --> 48:39.001
Don't you have a savings or a nest egg?
A damn piggy bank?

48:39.167 --> 48:44.756
Aaron, I'm in debt up to my ass.
I'm broke, man. It's "Hammertime," okay?

48:44.840 --> 48:48.093
If I don't get some money soon,
I'm gonna have to do a damn reality show.

48:48.176 --> 48:52.180
Okay, so, I gotta pay for the funeral,
the catering, and all this other shit,

48:52.264 --> 48:55.183
and now I gotta pull $30,000 out of my ass?

48:55.267 --> 48:57.477
- You know, he's your dad, too.
- Yeah, but you the oldest.

48:57.561 --> 49:00.439
- By nine months, as you love to point out.
- Doesn't matter.

49:00.522 --> 49:03.358
Besides, you been living off
of Mom and Dad long enough.

49:03.442 --> 49:06.570
You must've saved some money.
What? You haven't paid rent in a long time.

49:06.695 --> 49:08.822
Hey, hey, I've been living with them,
not off them.

49:08.905 --> 49:10.616
And Dad's been retired for five years.

49:10.699 --> 49:12.451
Who do you think's been paying
all these bills?

49:12.534 --> 49:16.955
Well, if we both got money issues,
what can we do? Fuck him! Fuck...

49:17.289 --> 49:19.416
Fuck him, Aaron. Fuck him.

49:22.461 --> 49:24.713
Pay the man. Just pay him.

49:36.475 --> 49:38.352
- Are you okay there, friend?
- Hey, fuck no.

49:38.435 --> 49:41.813
My nephew's dead, and the little bastards
ate all the potato salad. Shit.

49:41.897 --> 49:44.274
Listen, I think we're just about ready
to start that service again.

49:44.399 --> 49:46.860
Just five more minutes, please, please.
Just five. Five.

49:46.943 --> 49:49.196
Hey, hey, baby, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

49:49.279 --> 49:53.075
No, we're not gonna be able to move out
as soon as we hoped. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49:53.158 --> 49:56.912
Wait. Listen to me.
Hello? What are you talking about?

49:56.995 --> 49:59.039
You know I wouldn't have said it
unless I had a good reason.

49:59.122 --> 50:02.918
- Okay, fine, so what's the reason?
- Aaron, we don't have time right now.

50:03.085 --> 50:05.003
Aaron, listen,
I am trying to be understanding,

50:05.087 --> 50:07.756
but you have some explaining to do.
And I mean it!

50:07.839 --> 50:10.175
Just a little more time, okay?

50:16.765 --> 50:20.394
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
that's not supposed to be read yet.

50:20.477 --> 50:24.231
- Well, it was on the coffee table.
- And what's that supposed to mean?

50:24.314 --> 50:27.359
Well, when someone leaves something
on a coffee table,

50:27.442 --> 50:30.278
it's assumed it's for everybody.
That's pretty standard.

50:30.362 --> 50:32.656
Those are coffee table rules.

50:33.782 --> 50:36.785
- Can we get to the point here?
- Fine by me.

50:38.787 --> 50:42.082
So, I write the cheque,
you give us the photos,

50:42.165 --> 50:44.084
and you stay away from our mother.

50:44.167 --> 50:46.211
- Is that the deal?
- Deal.

50:46.962 --> 50:48.130
Okay.

50:50.132 --> 50:52.467
- What's your last name?
- Lovett.

50:53.385 --> 50:54.886
With two "Ts."

50:56.054 --> 50:58.557
- Lovett.
- Is that your first one?

50:58.640 --> 51:01.518
- What?
- The novel. It's a first draft.

51:01.977 --> 51:05.605
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so?
- No, nothing.

51:08.650 --> 51:11.194
I tried writing once.
Didn't work for me, either.

51:11.278 --> 51:15.073
I think it's like a gift.
Either you have it or you don't.

51:15.824 --> 51:17.075
Must be hard for you, though.

51:17.159 --> 51:19.995
I mean, your brother
being a bestselling author and all.

51:20.078 --> 51:25.250
Your father and I read <i>Rhonda's Tiny Box</i>
cover to cover together.

51:25.333 --> 51:28.587
We loved it. He was so proud of you.

51:28.670 --> 51:31.715
Well, thank you. I guess.

51:32.257 --> 51:37.053
- That's it. I can't do it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Aaron. Aaron, no, no.

51:37.137 --> 51:38.263
What are you doing?

51:38.346 --> 51:42.642
There is no way in the world I'm giving
this guy my hard-earned money. No.

51:42.726 --> 51:44.186
Hey, don't be stupid, okay?

51:44.269 --> 51:46.396
Now, I'll pay you back
as soon as my advance comes in.

51:46.480 --> 51:49.733
He picks today,
the day of our father's funeral.

51:49.816 --> 51:53.320
And then on top of that,
he insults my book? No! No!

51:53.403 --> 51:56.490
- But he got pictures.
- So what? I don't give a fuck what he's got.

51:56.573 --> 52:00.285
He can show them to the world.
He can put them on Facebook for all I care.

52:00.368 --> 52:02.412
Who the fuck does he think he is?

52:02.496 --> 52:05.248
Fine. But this is on your head.

52:05.332 --> 52:08.710
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Hold on now, hold on.

52:08.794 --> 52:10.170
Okay, you need to back off.

52:10.253 --> 52:13.340
- No, no, no. Let's discuss this for a minute.
- There is nothing to discuss.

52:13.423 --> 52:16.760
- No, don't...
- I said back off, buddy!

52:16.843 --> 52:19.137
You gonna bring a gat to a funeral?

52:19.221 --> 52:22.098
Now, nobody got to get capped. Nobody...

52:24.976 --> 52:27.062
- Get his gun! Get his gun!
- He ain't got no damn gun.

52:27.145 --> 52:30.190
- You got any rope? Any duct tape?
- Hey, what do I look like, a serial killer?

52:30.273 --> 52:33.235
I don't just keep rope and duct tape
in my pocket.

52:33.318 --> 52:37.614
- I can't see nothing. There you go.
- Help! Help!

52:37.697 --> 52:39.783
- Hey, use your tie!
- My tie, my tie?

52:39.866 --> 52:42.077
- What the fuck am I gonna do with my tie?
- Stuff it in his mouth.

52:42.160 --> 52:47.082
All right, first key... First key to war
is to cut off communication.

52:47.165 --> 52:50.794
All right, now, grab that curtain thing.
Hurry up. Grab the curtain thing.

52:52.546 --> 52:55.382
Tie his legs. Come on, Aaron, damn!

52:55.465 --> 53:00.095
- Feel like I'm in a fucking rodeo!
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, now get his hands. Shit.

53:00.178 --> 53:02.889
God damn. Strong, ain't he?
Damn it, do I gotta do everything?

53:03.014 --> 53:05.058
Everything but write a fucking cheque!

53:05.183 --> 53:07.811
You know what was in that cake?
What's going on? Who's that dude?

53:07.894 --> 53:10.522
Norman, come in and shut the damn door.
Come on, Aaron, tie it.

53:10.605 --> 53:12.357
- What's happening?
- He having a seizure.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.692
- Damn!
- Yeah, yeah.

53:13.775 --> 53:15.652
You know what?
I just found some Valium outside.

53:15.735 --> 53:18.154
- You think this will calm him down?
- Good. Yeah, yeah, give him some.

53:18.238 --> 53:19.322
- Okay. All right.
- Come on.

53:19.406 --> 53:20.949
Put this jacket under his head

53:21.032 --> 53:22.993
so he don't bite down
on his tongue.

53:23.076 --> 53:24.995
I learned that procedure
at Boys and Girls High School.

53:25.078 --> 53:27.956
- Come on.
- Here, buddy, this'll make you feel calm.

53:28.039 --> 53:29.791
- Open up, open up.
- There you go.

53:29.875 --> 53:33.753
- Right there. Yes, yes, baby.
- Open up, open up.

53:33.837 --> 53:36.089
- Yeah.
- Look at that. You gonna be fine, my friend.

53:36.172 --> 53:38.592
- Did you guys happen to see a little...
- Come, come in, Jeff, come in.

53:38.675 --> 53:40.802
Norman, I told you to lock the damn door.

53:40.886 --> 53:42.888
You said, "Shut the damn door," Ryan!

53:42.971 --> 53:45.557
- What's... What's going on?
- He's having a seizure.

53:45.640 --> 53:49.477
- Yeah. So, why is he all tied up?
- We don't want him to swallow his tongue.

53:49.561 --> 53:51.813
No. That's part of the medical procedure.

53:58.904 --> 54:00.238
Oh, God.

54:30.477 --> 54:32.145
He's blackmailing you? Over what?

54:32.228 --> 54:35.398
If I could tell you,
it wouldn't be blackmail, now, would it?

54:35.523 --> 54:39.945
Hey, look, just trust us. He's the bad guy.
Okay? We'll explain it to you later.

54:40.028 --> 54:41.404
Yeah, well, what are we gonna do with him?

54:41.488 --> 54:44.199
Yeah, what are we gonna do, Ryan?
Now that you've jumped his ass?

54:44.282 --> 54:47.243
- I don't know. Okay? You think, people.
- You're the big writer.

54:47.327 --> 54:49.746
Why don't you write something
where we all live happily ever after?

54:49.829 --> 54:53.500
- How long's that Valium gonna last?
- Valium? What... What Valium?

54:53.583 --> 54:55.460
I found a bottle of Valium,

54:55.543 --> 54:59.130
so we gave him a few,
thinking it would calm him down.

55:00.173 --> 55:02.884
You gave him a few of these? Oh, shit.

55:02.968 --> 55:04.552
- What?
- What?

55:04.636 --> 55:05.845
See...

55:07.555 --> 55:10.350
I just gave him a few Valium.

55:10.433 --> 55:13.019
I found them on the ground outside.

55:15.981 --> 55:17.732
All right, see, here's the story.

55:17.816 --> 55:21.778
All right. Everybody calling
these little guys here Valium,

55:21.861 --> 55:24.072
they're wrong, 'cause it's not Valium.
- Yeah, and?

55:24.155 --> 55:27.867
It's more like acid mixed with acid,
which is acid.

55:29.077 --> 55:32.414
And Oscar took one earlier by mistake,
which is why he's been acting all crazy.

55:32.497 --> 55:33.581
Jeff, what are you doing with that stuff?

55:33.665 --> 55:36.418
I just whipped up a simple
batch for a friend.

55:36.501 --> 55:39.587
- What friend, Amy Winehouse?
- Wait. Wait a minute.

55:39.671 --> 55:41.589
You telling us that Elaine's boyfriend,

55:41.673 --> 55:43.675
old boy
who knocked over our father's coffin,

55:43.758 --> 55:45.844
only had one of those things?
- Yeah. One.

55:45.927 --> 55:47.345
- Oh, shit.
- Shit's right.

55:47.429 --> 55:50.098
- And you gave him how many?
- About four or five.

55:50.181 --> 55:53.601
Four or five? Jesus, Norman!
That poor bastard.

55:53.685 --> 55:56.354
- I thought they were Valium.
- Look, you at a ten, I need you at a two.

55:56.438 --> 55:57.605
Jeff, I thought they were Valium.

55:57.731 --> 55:58.857
- But five?
- Yes.

55:58.940 --> 56:01.067
I mean, I wouldn't give somebody
five cough drops.

56:01.192 --> 56:02.861
See, that's 'cause the
wave cap is too tight.

56:02.944 --> 56:04.696
Okay, okay,
maybe we should call an ambulance.

56:04.779 --> 56:07.282
If anyone finds out
that this guy's been force-fed acid,

56:07.407 --> 56:10.618
we could all be arrested. TMZ, here I come.

56:10.744 --> 56:12.454
- Could he die?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

56:12.579 --> 56:14.289
- What?
- Could he die?

56:14.414 --> 56:16.791
No! Crazy. Maybe.

56:17.625 --> 56:19.794
A little bit. Possibly. It depends.

56:19.919 --> 56:22.797
Aaron? Ryan, honey?
Are you in there, baby?

56:22.964 --> 56:24.799
We need to get things started.

56:24.924 --> 56:27.886
Ma, we'll be right out.

56:27.969 --> 56:30.472
Okay, look, look, look.
We gotta go out there, okay?

56:30.638 --> 56:32.724
We gotta buy some time
until we figure this out.

56:32.807 --> 56:34.225
You two stay here and watch him.

56:34.309 --> 56:35.727
What you mean, us stay here and watch...

56:35.810 --> 56:37.812
Norman, just make sure
he doesn't escape, okay?

56:37.937 --> 56:39.230
Just lock the door behind us.

56:39.314 --> 56:42.567
This is all your fault.
You and your chemistry set, man.

56:42.650 --> 56:44.652
- Ever since the ninth grade...
- Shut up, Norman.

56:46.654 --> 56:49.240
Hey, Mom. How's it going?

56:49.324 --> 56:52.494
Reverend Davis wants to talk
to the two of you.

56:53.119 --> 56:56.247
- Aaron, where's your tie?
- I'm looking for it.

56:59.501 --> 57:03.505
Now, look, I have been patient,
but I'm about done with patience.

57:03.588 --> 57:05.673
If we don't resume this
funeral pretty soon,

57:05.799 --> 57:08.468
we gonna have to have a little conversation
about my compensation.

57:08.593 --> 57:11.179
Sure. Could I get five more minutes?

57:12.931 --> 57:14.682
Why are you making me
go through this again?

57:14.808 --> 57:16.518
- Just hear me out, okay?
- Listen...

57:16.601 --> 57:18.353
The only reason you won't go out with me

57:18.436 --> 57:21.189
is 'cause your dad likes me.
- No! It...

57:22.607 --> 57:25.693
- Can you... Can I get some help, please?
- Good Lord, your skin's so supple...

57:25.777 --> 57:27.779
- Can you stop that?
- Okay.

57:27.862 --> 57:31.616
The real reason why I don't wanna go out
with you is because it was a mistake before.

57:31.699 --> 57:34.786
We had a couple of intense months,

57:34.869 --> 57:40.291
but then I realised that we just... - Not
fair, not true. We had a lot of fun. We...

57:42.293 --> 57:45.547
- I bought you a watch, right?
- Here.

57:45.672 --> 57:47.382
- Why?
- Take it.

57:47.507 --> 57:50.051
What about our first night together?
After Norman's party?

57:50.176 --> 57:52.804
- That was amazing. Transcendent.
- I was so drunk.

57:52.887 --> 57:55.140
You could've been a donkey for all I knew.

57:55.223 --> 57:58.893
- Thank you.
- It's not a compliment, Derek! You know...

57:59.561 --> 58:02.397
Go away. Go away.

58:02.480 --> 58:06.568
You still think about me though, don't you?
Don't say anything.

58:10.196 --> 58:11.739
What is wrong with him?

58:11.865 --> 58:13.575
It's beautiful.

58:26.045 --> 58:28.381
There's still no potato salad.

58:31.092 --> 58:33.052
- Hey, Uncle Russell.
- Hey, hey.

58:33.136 --> 58:35.638
No, you... That belongs to this lady.
You don't wanna eat that.

58:35.763 --> 58:38.266
She don't need it. It's mine now.

58:40.310 --> 58:41.603
What's your problem, son?

58:41.728 --> 58:43.897
It's women.
Women are my problem, Uncle Russell.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.524
No such thing as having a woman
without a problem.

58:46.608 --> 58:47.901
- Right.
- If they didn't have problems,

58:47.984 --> 58:50.320
they wouldn't let us touch them.
- Right.

58:50.445 --> 58:53.406
Yeah. Let me tell you something
about women.

58:53.489 --> 58:55.825
Smarter than you think they are,

58:55.950 --> 58:59.245
but not nearly as smart
as they think they are.

58:59.329 --> 59:00.914
Sweet bitches.

59:02.123 --> 59:05.793
Yeah. I don't get it.
She acts like I don't exist.

59:05.919 --> 59:07.587
I can't believe she doesn't
feel the way I do.

59:07.670 --> 59:09.339
- She's just playing hard to get.
- Right.

59:09.464 --> 59:11.382
- She wants you to work for it a bit.
- Okay.

59:11.466 --> 59:14.385
A woman wants a man who can control her.

59:14.469 --> 59:19.515
- Yeah, you think so? Is that what it is?
- You walk up to her, and you shake her.

59:20.141 --> 59:21.559
- Shake her?
- Yeah.

59:21.643 --> 59:24.062
- You want me to shake her?
- Not shaking her hasn't worked, has it?

59:24.145 --> 59:27.941
- Yeah, okay.
- You shake her, and you kiss her.

59:28.358 --> 59:31.110
I just don't know if
that'll go over so well.

59:31.194 --> 59:32.946
- Man.
- What's up?

59:33.029 --> 59:36.532
I gotta take a shit.
Man, just when I had my potato...

59:36.658 --> 59:39.661
Hey, hey, hey, Norman! I gotta take a crap!

59:40.286 --> 59:43.790
- Look at his eyes. That doesn't look normal.
- He looks like a zombie.

59:43.873 --> 59:45.083
Hello?

59:45.166 --> 59:46.834
- Hello?
- Hello.

59:46.960 --> 59:49.837
- I need the toilet, open up!
- Go deal with him.

59:49.963 --> 59:51.506
Open the door.

59:52.507 --> 59:56.469
- Can't you use the one upstairs?
- I'm in a wheelchair, you fucking idiot!

59:56.552 --> 59:57.845
How am I supposed
to get up the goddamn stairs?

59:57.971 --> 59:59.055
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.850
- Open the fucking door!
- Let's put him behind the couch.

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:06.562
Shit. Man, I need the toilet. Open up.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:11.025
Norman!

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.864
- Open the goddamn door!
- Just a minute. I'm trying to find the key.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:19.534
I need the toilet, you fat bastard.

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:23.830
- Sorry, sorry.
- I'm just going across the room

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:25.790
to get the key, Uncle Russell.

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:29.043
So you could use the bathroom,
'cause I know you gotta doo-doo.

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:31.754
Now open the fucking door!
Shit! Damn it.

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:34.215
What the hell is going on here?

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.051
Uncle Russell.

01:00:37.427 --> 01:00:40.138
Get your ass out here.
Uncle Russell nothing, man. Shit.

01:00:40.388 --> 01:00:42.265
Come on, Aaron, think.

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:44.142
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Well, you know what?

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:47.145
- Stop thinking and do something.
- Why do I gotta do something?

01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:49.772
- You the one that tied him up.
- Well, somebody had to look out for Mama.

01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:52.108
I been looking out for Mom
since you got your book deal,

01:00:52.233 --> 01:00:53.860
you pompous piece of shit.

01:00:53.943 --> 01:00:55.278
You just can't get over it, can you?

01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:59.449
You burning with jealousy, all because I
left and did what you always wanted to do?

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:01.492
I couldn't just leave my family.

01:01:01.576 --> 01:01:05.705
I got Mom, I got Dad, I got a wife.
I got all sorts of responsibilities.

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:07.707
Don't put it off on responsibility.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:11.044
You spent three years on a novel,
and you won't let anybody read it.

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:13.046
What you gonna do? Wait until you're dead?

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:16.424
What you think you're gonna be,
the Tupac of books? Makaveli?

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:20.303
At least I'm not some hack writing
a bunch of crap, Mr <i>Mama's Secret.</i>

01:01:20.428 --> 01:01:22.096
The secret is it sucks.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.224
Mr <i>Black Hurt,</i> it hurts to read that shit.

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:30.271
Mr No Ink. Mr Blank Page.
Ain't nothing there. Ain't nothing there.

01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:31.856
At least my shit gets published.

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.483
That's what it's about,
just getting published?

01:01:33.608 --> 01:01:35.485
- Don't put your hand on me, Aaron.
- I'll put my hand on you.

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.112
- Don't touch me, man.
- I'll put my hand upside you.

01:01:38.196 --> 01:01:39.697
- Is that what you...
- I'm a hands-on motherfucker.

01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:41.366
What you wanna do, punch me?
Punch me in the face?

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:44.535
No. Why would I do that
when I could do this?

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:49.707
- Here, look. How does that feel?
- My ball. My ball.

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.794
I'm telling Mom.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.171
- I'm telling Mom.
- No, no.

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:57.465
Don't you tell Mama! Don't you tell Mama!

01:01:57.548 --> 01:01:59.258
- Aaron, you wrong.
- I got your black hurt.

01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:00.426
- I got your...
- Aaron.

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.136
- Go! Not now!
- What is going on?

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.097
- Get a brick or something.
- Why are you acting like this?

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.974
- Get off me. Tell her.
- Tell me what?

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.811
- What?
- Come here.

01:02:12.397 --> 01:02:15.316
Remember the guy with the leather jacket?

01:02:15.858 --> 01:02:17.276
Of course, yeah, your father's friend.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.948
Okay, I don't know how to tell you this,
but it looks like him and Dad were...

01:02:22.031 --> 01:02:24.117
Were being intimate.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.203
- They were having sex, Michelle.
- No.

01:02:27.328 --> 01:02:31.457
- Yeah.
- No. With him? Are you sure?

01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:33.584
- I mean, maybe he's here making the...
- We're sure.

01:02:33.668 --> 01:02:35.878
And what makes things worse

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:39.090
is now this guy wants $30,000.
- $30,000?

01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:42.009
Or else he's gonna start showing pictures
of them doing stuff.

01:02:42.093 --> 01:02:45.096
- Stuff? Like what kind of stuff?
- Sex stuff.

01:02:48.516 --> 01:02:49.767
Oh, my!

01:02:51.853 --> 01:02:53.020
- Okay.
- Quickly!

01:02:53.104 --> 01:02:55.189
- I got a goddamn torpedo coming down.
- Wait a minute!

01:02:55.273 --> 01:02:56.816
Get my pants.
Get my... Take my pants down!

01:02:56.899 --> 01:02:59.569
- You do that by yourself!
- No. How can I? I'm incapable!

01:02:59.652 --> 01:03:02.280
I'm goddamn handicapped!
My drawers, my drawers.

01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:04.031
- Don't leave me here...
- No, who calls them drawers?

01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:08.202
My drawers! My drawers! Come on!
Am I there? Come on. Shit.

01:03:08.286 --> 01:03:09.829
Wait a minute.

01:03:10.121 --> 01:03:12.999
- That's the snake in my mouth.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

01:03:13.082 --> 01:03:16.252
- No! No! My hand is stuck!
- How you get your hand...

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:19.922
- I love these padded seats.
- No! No, my hand is stuck!

01:03:20.006 --> 01:03:22.133
No, Uncle Russell! Please!

01:03:31.434 --> 01:03:34.145
Please come off. Please come off, man.

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:38.024
How does something like that happen?
Oh, my...

01:03:38.107 --> 01:03:39.734
Norman. Norman!

01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:43.988
Jeff, please, get me a towel. Please.

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.658
- What?
- You missed a spot.

01:03:48.743 --> 01:03:54.373
No! No! No! Please, God. No!

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.340
- Norman. Norman, calm down. Calm down.
- No! No!

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:04.175
I think I got some of it in my mouth.

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:07.929
Norman! Pull yourself together!

01:04:08.012 --> 01:04:11.682
Would you rather be shitty-mouthed
or get caught? Think.

01:04:12.517 --> 01:04:14.227
You right, you right.
I'm gonna get myself together.

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:16.979
Everything is copastetic. I'm gonna forget
about the poop in my mouth.

01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:22.193
- I'm just gonna hold my breath for a second.
- It never was there, never was there.

01:04:23.236 --> 01:04:24.779
- Shit.
- Oh, no.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.282
How the... How the...
How the fuck did he...

01:04:28.366 --> 01:04:31.035
- Check him.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, buddy?

01:04:31.118 --> 01:04:33.120
Hey. Are you okay, man?

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:36.040
Oh, shit.

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:40.795
- Hey, buddy.
- Check him.

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.172
- You okay?
- Wake up. Come on, wake up, little buddy.

01:04:43.256 --> 01:04:45.383
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

01:04:45.466 --> 01:04:47.176
- Larry, try Larry.
- Larry?

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.053
Shake him.

01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:50.596
- Hey, hey, Larry?
- Come on.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.724
- Yo, Larry?
- Maybe it's not Larry.

01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:56.519
Try another one. Bert, Ernie, I don't know,
Big Bird, whatever.

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:57.687
I'm gonna check to see if he's breathing,

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.397
'cause that's what people
do when they're alive, right?

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.275
I'm gonna check to make sure he's
breathing, 'cause he's gotta be breathing.

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:04.819
Lord Jesus, please let him be breathing.
He's not breathing.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.445
- Shit.
- What?

01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.283
He's dead.

01:05:11.826 --> 01:05:15.454
We're just gonna give this
guy half the money we saved.

01:05:15.538 --> 01:05:17.290
- It's not quite that simple.
- Well, why not?

01:05:17.373 --> 01:05:18.457
Aaron refused to pay.

01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:21.002
- Well, how come you couldn't pay, Ryan?
- That's not the point.

01:05:21.085 --> 01:05:23.796
Besides, the only reason
Aaron tore up the cheque

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:26.799
is because little man was talking shit
about his novel.

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:29.510
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, no.
- Wait. What?

01:05:30.595 --> 01:05:32.430
Your novel?

01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:36.267
You won't let me read your novel,
but you let that guy read your novel?

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.436
- I didn't let him.
- Really?

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:40.438
Really, Aaron? Really?

01:05:44.317 --> 01:05:45.818
Thanks a lot.

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:49.322
Let her go. She'll get over it.

01:05:50.031 --> 01:05:53.826
Hey. At least that white guy finally got
what he deserved.

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:56.829
Let me get this straight.

01:05:56.912 --> 01:06:01.876
Our father was having gay sex
with a guy that could fit in his pocket,

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.003
and you're mad 'cause he's white?

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:08.215
I don't give a fuck 'cause...
Leave me be. I'm grieving.

01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:09.884
Grieving.

01:06:12.553 --> 01:06:14.430
Hey, hi.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.392
What the fuck is he doing now?

01:06:18.476 --> 01:06:22.146
Norman. Why are you grinning
like Louis Armstrong?

01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:26.025
Aaron, Ryan,
could you please come to the study?

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:32.031
Smells like shit.

01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:34.158
Excuse me.

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:40.581
What? Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:43.209
Somebody call an ambulance.
Get an... Get an ambulance.

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:45.795
It's... It's... There's no point.

01:06:46.128 --> 01:06:47.880
What do you mean, there's no point?

01:06:47.963 --> 01:06:49.965
I mean, look at him, Aaron. He's dead.

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:51.550
You mean, like dead dead?

01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:53.886
- Is there any other kind of dead, Aaron?
- What did y'all do to him?

01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:55.846
- We didn't do nothing.
- Well, you must've done something.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.306
When we left, he was alive,

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.226
and I was expecting to find him that way
when I got back.

01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:04.063
He got in a fight with the table
and the table won.

01:07:04.146 --> 01:07:05.272
- This is really bad.
- Yeah.

01:07:05.356 --> 01:07:07.400
- Guys, what are we gonna do?
- About 25 to life.

01:07:07.483 --> 01:07:09.443
I think I have somewhere else to be
right now.

01:07:09.527 --> 01:07:11.821
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:11.904 --> 01:07:13.864
Ryan, I can't go to jail.
I'm not jail type.

01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:16.659
You know how fast a rash spreads
in prison?

01:07:16.742 --> 01:07:19.453
Cut that shit out.
No one here knows who this guy is.

01:07:19.537 --> 01:07:22.206
Nobody knows his name.
They probably didn't even notice him.

01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:24.750
Didn't notice him? He's
four fucking feet tall.

01:07:24.834 --> 01:07:26.419
All we gotta do is get rid of the body.

01:07:26.502 --> 01:07:28.129
- It'll be like he came and left.
- What are you gonna do,

01:07:28.212 --> 01:07:29.422
put it on Craigslist?

01:07:29.505 --> 01:07:32.466
Takes me two months to get rid of a couch!

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:34.218
Wait.

01:07:35.594 --> 01:07:38.931
Did anybody see the size
of Uncle Edward's coffin?

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:45.229
You wanna bury him with our father?

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:48.232
I mean, why not?
It's not like anybody's gonna notice.

01:07:48.315 --> 01:07:49.567
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.486
You gotta admit it makes sense, Aaron.
I mean, think about it.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:55.156
The coffin's here, the
hole's in the ground.

01:07:55.281 --> 01:07:58.075
I mean, unless you got a better suggestion,
big bro.

01:07:58.159 --> 01:08:00.494
I say we bury the motherfucker.

01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:05.082
It's funny. No matter what you say
or how many times you say it,

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:08.753
I'm still convinced
that we're gonna wind up together.

01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:11.922
Well, we all make mistakes, don't we?

01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:14.675
Elaine, I'm serious.
You only live once. All right?

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:17.595
So, you might as well do whatever it is
that's gonna make you the most happy.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:21.432
Maybe I found something outside of myself
that I truly care about.

01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:23.517
And maybe you should, too, Derek.

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:26.937
And I'm not talking about my father
or his money.

01:08:27.688 --> 01:08:31.692
Well, that's just...
That's just downright cold.

01:08:31.776 --> 01:08:35.362
- I care about you, Elaine.
- You don't, Derek. You care about you.

01:08:35.488 --> 01:08:38.198
You care about me in relation to
how I affect you.

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:41.368
Not true, Elaine. I deserve you. I do.

01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:42.787
- Get over yourself.
- I'm serious.

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:45.456
What is it about this guy?
What does he have that I don't?

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.291
Not success, right? Right?

01:08:47.374 --> 01:08:49.376
Well, for one thing, he's caring.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.627
- Come on.
- You wouldn't cross a room

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:51.796
to help somebody in need,

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:53.714
and that's all Oscar ever does.
- Come on.

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:56.466
He helps people. He's considerate.

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.719
- He's thoughtful. He's stable.
- Yeah?

01:08:58.803 --> 01:09:00.970
He's a bunch of things
that you will never be.

01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:02.723
- Like naked on the roof.
- What?

01:09:02.848 --> 01:09:03.974
Boy.

01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:06.477
Oh, my God! Oscar!

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.895
Listen to me,
I should've done this hours ago.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.147
What are you doing?

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:13.192
- I don't know, but come here.
- Stop it! No!

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:19.907
- Elaine? Oh, God.
- Get off me!

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:21.158
- Elaine!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:21.242 --> 01:09:23.243
- Seriously.
- Oscar!

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:26.162
Oscar, it's okay. What are you doing?

01:09:26.247 --> 01:09:27.747
- Could've had something beautiful, Elaine...
- Oscar!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:31.167
...but you had to ruin it.
Not even bleeding. You hit like a girl.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:33.170
Oscar! What are you doing?

01:09:33.254 --> 01:09:34.587
- What am I doing?
- What are you doing?

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:35.840
- I saw you kissing him.
- No!

01:09:35.923 --> 01:09:37.091
- No, I wasn't kissing him!
- Yes, I just saw it.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:38.926
- You just kissed him!
- No, I didn't kiss him,

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:40.094
- I swear to you.
- One more thing, Elaine.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.595
- You're a cheater.
- Shut up and get out of here!

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.264
She cheated on me. I'm gonna jump.

01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:46.267
- No! Honey! Honey, please, calm down.
- That's it. I'm gonna go talk to Norman.

01:09:46.392 --> 01:09:47.434
You guys are perfect for each other.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.935
- You have drugs in your system.
- I'm gonna jump.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.520
Oscar. No!

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:53.607
Oscar, get back here! Honey, please!

01:09:53.858 --> 01:09:55.943
- I'm gonna jump.
- Oscar, you're gonna hurt yourself.

01:09:56.026 --> 01:09:59.196
Oscar! Oh, my God!

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.117
- Oscar, are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm okay.

01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:07.204
Look at all you ants. Shit.

01:10:07.288 --> 01:10:10.624
Shit, this is high up. Jesus Christ.

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:14.670
So, how we gonna get him to the coffin?

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:17.631
What about that Louis Vuitton bag
you brought?

01:10:17.756 --> 01:10:19.550
We could fit two of him in there.

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:23.929
You know, Aaron, this ain't about us. Okay?
Come on, y'all, think.

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:29.476
- We should smuggle him in the laundry bag.
- Wow.

01:10:30.603 --> 01:10:33.188
Like they do in the prison movies.

01:10:33.314 --> 01:10:36.483
- Norman, it's Derek, let me in.
- Shit!

01:10:36.609 --> 01:10:38.277
- All right, let's put him in the bathroom.
- Norman!

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.195
- Hold on!
- Norman.

01:10:40.321 --> 01:10:42.489
Hold on! I'm trying to find my pants!

01:10:42.615 --> 01:10:44.575
- What pants?
- Hold on!

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.453
Man, open the door. It's an emergency.

01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:49.121
- Norman, please, let me in.
- Shit.

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:51.206
What the hell? Aaron?

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:53.167
What the hell's Uncle Russell doing
in the toilet?

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:56.045
- He had to go!
- I don't care, not in there, not now.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:58.297
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- That's how I got old man poop...

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.342
Aaron? Open the door. Let me in.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.637
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, Aaron.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.056
I gotta talk to Norman right now.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:08.891
Yeah, I'm here. What's up?

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:12.186
Hey, man, it's Oscar.
He went crazy. He's up...

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:15.105
- The hell's going on in here?
- Nothing. What?

01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:18.776
It's Oscar, man. He went crazy.
He's up on the roof, stark naked.

01:11:18.859 --> 01:11:21.195
He saw me kissing Elaine
and now he's threatening to jump.

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:25.699
- You were kissing Elaine?
- Yeah, I told you she was in love with me.

01:11:26.909 --> 01:11:28.577
- Shit!
- What?

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:30.037
I gotta... I gotta go.

01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:33.123
- Whoa, hold up. Where you going, big boy?
- Ry, Ry, if he jumps,

01:11:33.207 --> 01:11:34.333
my sister's gonna kill me.

01:11:34.416 --> 01:11:36.669
You know I wouldn't jump ship,
but I gotta go. Aaron, I'm out.

01:11:36.752 --> 01:11:40.381
Shit! I gotta go. Lock up.
Don't kill anybody.

01:11:44.677 --> 01:11:47.805
- She's cheating on me! That girl right there.
- Please, come down, baby.

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:50.307
- I'm gonna jump now.
- Oscar. Oscar, what are you doing?

01:11:50.391 --> 01:11:51.517
- She cheated on me!
- Oscar.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.311
I didn't do anything! He kissed me!

01:11:54.436 --> 01:11:56.105
Oscar! Try to get down.

01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:57.898
Please, come down, baby.

01:11:57.982 --> 01:12:00.067
- I don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I saw you kissing him,

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.902
cheating on me right in front of me.
What was that?

01:12:01.986 --> 01:12:04.488
- Can we just talk about it in here?
- Cheater, cheater, Derek eater,

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:07.408
had a dada, something, something.
- Oscar, please!

01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:11.787
You be quiet, Jezebel!
Cheaters never win, winners never cheat.

01:12:11.912 --> 01:12:13.622
- I'm coming up.
- No, ma'am.

01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:14.790
You don't wanna come back inside,

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:17.167
so I'm coming up.
- Elaine, this is a man's job!

01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:20.129
- You can't... Don't come up here!
- Don't do that! What are you doing?

01:12:20.254 --> 01:12:22.464
- Elaine. Elaine!
- You come up here, I'm jumping.

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:25.509
One more step, I'm...
I'm jumping off this roof.

01:12:25.592 --> 01:12:27.678
- Elaine!
- Elaine.

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:29.805
- Elaine!
- Don't come up here! I'm gonna jump.

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.598
What are you doing? Elaine!

01:12:31.682 --> 01:12:33.475
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.310
- God, what are you doing now?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:37.980
I think I can get rid of this guy,
but I need you to stay out here

01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:39.815
and make sure that nobody comes in, okay?

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.567
Okay, fine, fine, fine. I'll do what I can.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.318
- But, listen, you owe me.
- Okay.

01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:44.987
- Big time.
- Okay, okay, all the sperm you want.

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:46.572
- All the sperm you want.
- Yeah, please.

01:12:46.655 --> 01:12:48.699
- Don't.
- All the sperm I want. All the sperm I want.

01:12:48.824 --> 01:12:49.950
Okay.

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:56.165
- Who is it?
- It's Aaron.

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:59.001
Who do you think it is? Open the door.

01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:04.840
Everybody's outside.
We gotta move this body right now.

01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:06.467
- Well, let's do it.
- Let's go for it.

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:08.677
- Let me get my arms up.
- Come on. Come on.

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:10.471
- You got that?
- Be gentle, be gentle.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:12.639
Just because he's dead
don't mean he can't bruise.

01:13:12.723 --> 01:13:15.851
- He's small, but he's heavy as shit.
- You turn him around this way.

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.269
- Come on. You go first.
- Be careful with his head.

01:13:17.352 --> 01:13:18.479
- All right.
- Be careful with his head.

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:20.814
I wish Dad would've picked a smaller guy.

01:13:20.898 --> 01:13:22.149
Quick.

01:13:23.901 --> 01:13:25.152
Quick.

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:27.071
You got it. Come on.

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:30.741
- Make sure no one comes in.
- Okay.

01:13:35.996 --> 01:13:38.165
Hey there, young fellow.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:40.250
- Hey, Reverend!
- You think I can find a phone somewhere?

01:13:40.334 --> 01:13:41.460
There's something I wanna ask you.

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:43.879
At what age did you decide
to get your church on?

01:13:44.046 --> 01:13:47.049
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:50.552
- I really need to use the phone.
- That's cool.

01:13:50.636 --> 01:13:52.763
- Was there one inside here?
- No, there's no one inside there,

01:13:52.846 --> 01:13:54.098
but I need to make a confession.

01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:57.101
- I'm not a priest.
- That's all right, 'cause I'm not a Catholic!

01:13:57.184 --> 01:14:01.605
It's just that, I know that I've been
touched in some religious fashion.

01:14:12.658 --> 01:14:13.742
I'm addicted to strip clubs.

01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:17.955
The smell, the pole, the stretch marks,
the C-section scars.

01:14:18.038 --> 01:14:22.376
I didn't know nothing about whip cream.
Nothing! I didn't even... 'Cause I'm diabetic,

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:25.170
so if I eat whip cream in the wrong place,
I'm gonna break out.

01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:30.843
- Got him?
- Got him.

01:14:38.934 --> 01:14:41.478
We can't just leave him like this.

01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:47.568
Well, in a strange way,
this might be what he wanted.

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:51.738
Come on, man.
You can't be serious for one damn second?

01:14:51.822 --> 01:14:55.284
Just forget it, man.
That's just more Ryan bullshit.

01:14:55.367 --> 01:14:57.870
Why you gotta say shit like that?

01:14:58.453 --> 01:15:01.373
Why don't you try laughing, enjoying life?

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:03.458
Be spontaneous for once.

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:06.086
It might make you a better writer.

01:15:06.378 --> 01:15:08.380
- You done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

01:15:08.463 --> 01:15:10.007
Let's do this.

01:15:10.591 --> 01:15:13.302
Just this light came down on me,
and there was angels,

01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:14.761
but they were dressed like strippers.
- Look, look,

01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:17.222
I really need to make a phone call.
There's a man outside on the roof

01:15:17.306 --> 01:15:18.473
and he's about to jump.
- Don't worry about it.

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:20.851
- He gonna be jumping for joy after I get...
- Wait, wait, hey!

01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:23.562
But, Reverend, I haven't
finished telling you.

01:15:23.645 --> 01:15:26.523
- I met Shalawnda in the strip club.
- Let's pray.

01:15:27.566 --> 01:15:28.901
Bye, Dad.

01:15:34.072 --> 01:15:35.657
- Oscar...
- Don't come any closer,

01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:38.368
or I'm gonna jump off this roof.
- I love you. I only love you.

01:15:38.452 --> 01:15:40.495
- What were you doing with him, then?
- I wasn't with him.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:43.081
- I saw you kissing him passionately.
- He kissed me!

01:15:43.165 --> 01:15:44.958
It doesn't matter. I'll
never be good enough.

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:46.960
- That's not true.
- I'll never be good enough for your father.

01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:49.338
- I'm never gonna be good enough for you.
- Baby, come inside, please.

01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:51.506
- No, you go inside.
- You have to come with me.

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.091
Why should I?

01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:56.428
Because you're gonna be a father.

01:16:00.098 --> 01:16:01.850
- I'm pregnant?
- No.

01:16:03.143 --> 01:16:06.104
- I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant, too?

01:16:07.773 --> 01:16:10.609
Yes. We're pregnant.

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:12.903
- We're gonna have a baby?
- Yeah.

01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:14.238
Really?

01:16:16.949 --> 01:16:20.160
Baby, you scared me. Don't do that.

01:16:20.911 --> 01:16:22.746
We're having a baby!

01:16:24.873 --> 01:16:26.750
- Great.
- It's okay.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:29.002
I wish somebody would give me a baby.

01:16:29.086 --> 01:16:30.545
You blew it, son!

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.923
This is... It's upsetting for me, too.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.716
I'm gonna go check on Cynthia.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.637
Aaron? Hurry up! People are coming inside!

01:16:38.804 --> 01:16:41.348
Aaron! Is he gone?

01:16:42.683 --> 01:16:45.519
- Looks like it.
- Well, everything's cool?

01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:48.021
Everything's cool. It's...

01:16:48.772 --> 01:16:49.856
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.608
- Can we go now?
- Yeah.

01:16:51.692 --> 01:16:53.318
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:16:54.778 --> 01:16:56.154
Oh, my God!

01:16:56.238 --> 01:16:58.699
Oscar, hold on! Oh, my God!

01:16:58.782 --> 01:17:00.826
Honey. Oh, shit.

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:02.619
- Jeff!
- Fuck!

01:17:02.703 --> 01:17:05.163
- Jeff! Jeff, help me, please!
- Stay... Stay right... Stay right there!

01:17:05.247 --> 01:17:06.999
- Elaine, stay right there!
- Be careful, he's on something.

01:17:07.082 --> 01:17:08.166
- I got him, I got him.
- Okay?

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.377
Someone's coming up. You're gonna be fine.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.087
- Jeff!
- I'm slipping, I'm slipping.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:14.089
Pull yourself back up!

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:17.342
Jeff! Jeff, hurry up!

01:17:18.427 --> 01:17:21.013
- Pull yourself back up!
- Okay, I can't do it.

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:23.265
- Somebody, help me, please!
- Help me!

01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:24.558
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.184
- Oscar, I'm coming!
- Come on.

01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:27.477
Oscar!

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:32.733
Baby, please, help me, help me.
I can't hold you.

01:17:32.858 --> 01:17:34.860
- Who's that?
- I got him. I got him.

01:17:34.943 --> 01:17:37.195
- Jeff! It's Jeff!
- Jeff?

01:17:37.279 --> 01:17:39.364
My manhood is being questioned right now.

01:17:39.448 --> 01:17:42.075
Just... Come on.

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:44.328
- You have him?
- Yeah, it's on my cheek.

01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:45.996
- Okay. I'm letting go now!
- It's on my cheek, Elaine.

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:48.415
- You're okay, Jeff has you.
- He's incredibly endowed.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.751
I could use some help here, please.

01:17:50.876 --> 01:17:52.753
- Yeah.
- I got you, buddy.

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:54.504
- You're so beautiful.
- Okay, I love you.

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:56.006
I love you!

01:18:00.552 --> 01:18:02.262
Hi, Miss Cynthia.

01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:04.181
Norman.

01:18:05.599 --> 01:18:07.059
Is that you?

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:10.103
Aaron?

01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:13.940
- Aaron, I really think we should start again.
- I'll get the reverend.

01:18:14.066 --> 01:18:17.194
Ryan, thank you so much
for getting things back on track.

01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:19.738
I am really so glad you're here.

01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:26.036
Where's Uncle Russell?

01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:29.289
I'm starting to feel better.

01:18:29.373 --> 01:18:32.042
- Good.
- Thanks to you. And you.

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:35.796
And you, Jeff. Thank you.

01:18:35.879 --> 01:18:37.547
Thank you, Jeff.

01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:43.136
- That was very brave.
- Hey. Whoa, whoa.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.974
Listen, no of fence, but, like, me and you
can't never touch again.

01:18:48.308 --> 01:18:49.768
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:52.813
- Jeff.
- All right.

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:54.147
Thank you.

01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:57.567
I need to go get,
like, a big-ass Tic Tac right now.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:01.154
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

01:19:02.489 --> 01:19:05.158
- Oh, shit.
- Jeff...

01:19:06.493 --> 01:19:10.497
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm just...
I'm just real vulnerable right now.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.581
Do you have those buttons there?

01:19:11.665 --> 01:19:12.916
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.751
- Elaine.
- Dad.

01:19:14.835 --> 01:19:17.504
- Thank God you're safe.
- Yes. We're good.

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:21.091
And you. You imbecile.
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:22.259
Stay away from my daughter.

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:24.928
- Look, Dad...
- Elaine, stay out of this.

01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:28.348
No! I'm not gonna stay out of it.
This is my life.

01:19:29.266 --> 01:19:32.686
You don't like it, too bad.
But I'm gonna tell you something.

01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:34.771
If you wanna have me
and my child in your life,

01:19:34.855 --> 01:19:37.983
you better change your attitude.
You got that?

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:43.405
- I love you.
- My little girl.

01:19:44.698 --> 01:19:45.866
Yeah.

01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:49.494
I love you, too, Dad.

01:19:52.706 --> 01:19:54.708
What the fuck's going on in here?

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:56.960
- Sorry, Uncle Russell.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

01:19:57.043 --> 01:20:00.338
Somebody was on the roof,
and we just had to get him off.

01:20:00.422 --> 01:20:02.466
Okay, I got your pants.
I got your pants. Hold on.

01:20:02.549 --> 01:20:05.844
Never mind that. What about
that dead body you dragged in here?

01:20:05.927 --> 01:20:07.095
- What...
- Dead body?

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:08.930
- No dead body.
- Hey, don't mess with me!

01:20:09.055 --> 01:20:12.184
I know a dead man when I see one.
I live in a goddamn retirement home.

01:20:12.267 --> 01:20:14.561
Let's go, God damn it.
It smells in this room. Shit!

01:20:15.395 --> 01:20:18.190
- How's the... How's the skin thing?
- I don't know.

01:20:18.273 --> 01:20:21.401
I'm more concerned with the shit smell.
Can you tell?

01:20:21.526 --> 01:20:25.405
Yeah, yeah, but the thing on your hand,
you just put a little vinegar on it.

01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:27.449
That'll clear it right up.
It's an old family secret.

01:20:27.574 --> 01:20:30.243
The shit thing, I can't help you with.

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:32.579
I would recommend a shower or a bath.

01:20:32.704 --> 01:20:34.748
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:20:35.373 --> 01:20:38.627
- I'm sorry about the whole Elaine thing, man.
- It's okay.

01:20:38.752 --> 01:20:42.172
Did you hear she's gonna have a kid?
Can you see me as a dad?

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:43.590
- No.
- No.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:47.135
Well, this shit's been crazy.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:52.224
You have people falling out of the casket,
you got people hanging off the roof.

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:54.100
Can I have the keys?
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

01:20:54.226 --> 01:20:55.852
- What?
- I'm just tired.

01:20:55.936 --> 01:20:58.230
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:20:58.313 --> 01:20:59.439
Hey.

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:03.318
- Love you.
- Hey, I love you, too.

01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.445
I saw him! He was dead!

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:08.281
- I know you did, Uncle Russell. We all did.
- Shit.

01:21:08.406 --> 01:21:12.536
No, dumbshit. In the bathroom.
He was in the bathroom dead.

01:21:12.619 --> 01:21:15.872
I cannot believe
what a nightmare today has been.

01:21:15.956 --> 01:21:19.793
I don't know, I think it's kind
of exciting. For a funeral.

01:21:21.503 --> 01:21:26.800
- Listen, about that stuff earlier, I...
- I know, we'll work it out.

01:21:27.092 --> 01:21:28.677
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:29.803
Let's just get through this day

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:32.722
and then we'll worry
about the rest of our lives.

01:21:32.806 --> 01:21:34.891
I still have to give this eulogy.

01:21:34.975 --> 01:21:37.269
After everything I found out.

01:21:37.352 --> 01:21:40.647
We've really got
to get this damn thing started.

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:44.526
Look, we're gonna have
to zip through this thing now, son.

01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:46.486
I mean, I've already missed a funeral
and two christenings.

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:50.282
- Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's... Let's start.
- Okay. You want a open casket?

01:21:50.365 --> 01:21:51.658
- No!
- No.

01:21:52.325 --> 01:21:53.702
All right.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:21:58.081
Everybody in their seats now.

01:21:58.498 --> 01:21:59.749
- You with the hat?
- Yeah?

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.126
Sit on down.

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:04.045
Now, I'd like to apologise
on behalf of the family

01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:06.881
for all of the distractions.

01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:12.345
Aaron, the oldest son, would like to say
a few words about his father.

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:14.723
Thank you.

01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:24.274
Okay.

01:22:26.234 --> 01:22:30.697
"My father was an exceptional man.

01:22:38.246 --> 01:22:41.291
"He was born in 19..."

01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:45.754
- What the hell is going on now?
- There's someone in there.

01:22:45.879 --> 01:22:48.131
I knew it! I knew it!

01:22:48.214 --> 01:22:52.719
"He was born in 1930..."

01:22:54.429 --> 01:22:55.597
Shit.

01:22:56.765 --> 01:22:57.932
Shit.

01:22:59.934 --> 01:23:01.603
What the fuck!

01:23:01.728 --> 01:23:04.564
What the fuck you doing
in my father's coffin?

01:23:09.944 --> 01:23:12.405
Edward, I miss you!

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:15.408
Leave me with my Edward!

01:23:15.492 --> 01:23:18.745
My picture. My beautiful memories!

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:24.417
No, Mama, don't. Give me...

01:23:25.502 --> 01:23:27.253
You bastard!

01:23:36.638 --> 01:23:38.807
My father!

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:45.939
My father was an exceptional man.

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:51.361
Did he have his faults?

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.198
Yeah.

01:23:57.242 --> 01:24:00.453
But he worked hard for his family.

01:24:00.537 --> 01:24:03.081
All I wanted to do today

01:24:03.164 --> 01:24:09.462
was tell him how much we all loved,
cherished and respected him.

01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:13.007
Is that really too much to ask for?

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.846
So, maybe he loved <i>Dreamgirls</i>
more than most men.

01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:22.726
But, hey, life is complicated.

01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:24.936
We do our best.

01:24:25.979 --> 01:24:28.440
And Dad, he did his best.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.068
One thing he did

01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:35.363
was teach us to chase after our dreams.

01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:39.451
So, when you leave here today,

01:24:39.534 --> 01:24:43.830
I want you to remember my father
for who he truly was,

01:24:43.913 --> 01:24:49.461
a loving, kind, gentle man,
that never judged anyone,

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:54.257
who never cast disparaging remarks

01:24:55.925 --> 01:25:02.265
or held prejudice against any race,
creed, gender,

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:04.893
or height.

01:25:05.727 --> 01:25:10.356
And if I turn out to be just half the man
that my father was,

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.694
then the child I'm planning on having
with my beautiful wife

01:25:16.404 --> 01:25:18.323
will be truly blessed.

01:25:24.788 --> 01:25:26.164
Thank you.

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.710
Well done, son.

01:25:33.338 --> 01:25:35.381
It's gonna be good, boy.

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:38.384
Good job.

01:25:40.887 --> 01:25:43.264
Oscar, let's not do this again.

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.521
I always thought he had a little sugar
in his tank.

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:04.035
Hey, how's Mom holding up?

01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:06.830
She's good. Resting.

01:26:08.289 --> 01:26:12.293
You know, it's gonna take a while
for her to accept Dad was...

01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:15.338
You know.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.048
She'll be okay.

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:21.427
You know, that was a pretty good send-off
you gave the old man. You wrote that?

01:26:21.511 --> 01:26:24.806
Some guy I met told me
I need to be spontaneous.

01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:28.226
Yeah, well, Dad would've been proud.
I know I was.

01:26:28.935 --> 01:26:32.021
Maybe when you're ready, you'll let me
take a look at that novel of yours.

01:26:32.105 --> 01:26:33.439
Yeah.

01:26:33.523 --> 01:26:36.734
- Yeah, I'm gonna send it to you next week.
- All right.

01:26:36.818 --> 01:26:40.071
- But you know Michelle gotta read it first.
- Okay.

01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:42.782
I'm not going through that again.

01:26:42.866 --> 01:26:45.368
All right. Well, thanks, big bro.

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:48.788
Sure you don't wanna stay another day?

01:26:49.914 --> 01:26:52.333
Got a good Laker game coming up.

01:26:53.084 --> 01:26:54.919
- Your boy, Kobe.
- No.

01:26:55.545 --> 01:26:58.089
I'd just be feeling sad or be in the way.

01:26:58.172 --> 01:27:01.175
You know how it is.
Probably gonna get on back.

01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:04.220
You know, do my thing. Still gotta grieve.

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:06.514
Me, too.

01:27:13.396 --> 01:27:16.149
What? A brother's gotta get to the airport.

01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:19.986
Come on, you better make sure
you don't go to jail first.

01:27:20.778 --> 01:27:22.405
- Hey.
- Ryan.

01:27:22.488 --> 01:27:24.490
- Sis.
- Baby, listen,

01:27:24.616 --> 01:27:28.828
don't stay away so long next time, okay?
- I sure won't. All right, bro.

01:27:28.953 --> 01:27:30.663
Hey, next funeral.

01:27:32.165 --> 01:27:34.792
- Love you, man.
- Love you, too, man.

01:27:41.007 --> 01:27:43.176
Wow, I see he got his ride.

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:46.179
Yeah. R. Kelly used the same car service.

01:27:51.851 --> 01:27:53.978
Just like candy.

01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:03.780
I am worn out. This has been a long day.

01:28:03.863 --> 01:28:05.615
A long, long day.

01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:08.368
- And guess what?
- What?

01:28:12.121 --> 01:28:13.873
Now I'm interested.

01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:19.337
No Mama. No guests. No Uncle Russell.

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:24.050
- Where's Uncle Russell?
- He's upstairs.

01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:27.220
I gave him a couple Valium
and put him to bed.

01:28:29.389 --> 01:28:30.515
What?

01:28:31.516 --> 01:28:34.060
Shit. Man.

01:28:35.186 --> 01:28:37.522
Everything's so fucking green.
