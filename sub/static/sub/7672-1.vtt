Most 16, 17-year-old kids,
they make a bad choice,

01:29.176 --> 01:31.127
something gets broken,

01:31.161 --> 01:33.128
they screw up in class,

01:33.161 --> 01:35.185
hurt somebody's feelings,

01:35.218 --> 01:37.176
show up at the prom drunk,

01:37.209 --> 01:39.736
they get sent to the principal's office,

01:39.769 --> 01:41.783
have their car keys taken away

01:41.817 --> 01:43.383
or get grounded.

01:50.784 --> 01:53.390
Then there's kids, they make a bad choice,

01:53.424 --> 01:55.998
somebody ends up shot dead
in a parkin' lot.

01:58.143 --> 02:00.085
Those kids get sent here.

02:24.188 --> 02:25.878
- Get off me, homey!
- Hey, man!

02:25.912 --> 02:27.125
I'll shut your mouth, punk!

02:27.159 --> 02:29.944
- Weathers! Get off of 'im! Get off-a him!
- You don't know me! Shut your mouth!

02:29.978 --> 02:33.721
- Get off me! Don't you ever diss my hood.
- I got him! Just get the door!

02:33.754 --> 02:35.095
Goddamn 88.

02:35.128 --> 02:36.176
Let's go, Weathers!

02:36.210 --> 02:38.137
Go back to sleep, guys. Lay down.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.545
What is wrong with you?

02:50.586 --> 02:51.665
Shit!

02:51.962 --> 02:53.587
G'night, Weathers.

03:00.632 --> 03:02.454
Back to bed, gentlemen.

03:35.029 --> 03:36.075
Mr. Porter?

03:36.109 --> 03:39.059
Gettin' beat in the middle of the night,
how do you like it, Roger? You like that?

03:39.093 --> 03:40.138
Whatchu hitting me for?

03:40.172 --> 03:41.422
What'd you hit Kelvin Owens for?

03:41.456 --> 03:42.603
He dissed my hood.

03:42.637 --> 03:44.366
And now he's up there asleep
and you're stuck in here.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.792
So what does that make you?

03:45.825 --> 03:47.152
Hey, man. Can you do dat?

03:47.185 --> 03:49.968
- Can I do what?
- Be smackin' me and shit.

03:51.763 --> 03:53.059
I guess I can.

03:53.092 --> 03:54.354
Shit, man!

04:01.650 --> 04:04.748
Roger, you're 17 years old.
Where you gonna be in four years, huh?

04:04.782 --> 04:06.192
I don't know.

04:06.225 --> 04:09.201
Answer me.
Where you gonna be when you're 21?

04:09.681 --> 04:11.274
Probably in jail.

04:11.307 --> 04:12.489
What?

04:13.106 --> 04:14.381
Look at me!

04:14.414 --> 04:15.656
What'd you say?

04:15.690 --> 04:16.774
In jail.

04:16.809 --> 04:20.426
No. You're not gonna be in jail.
You're gonna be dead.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.649
You're a good kid, Roger.

04:28.683 --> 04:30.791
But you're gonna be
back out on the streets tomorrow.

04:30.825 --> 04:32.236
Back in your hood with your homeys.

04:32.270 --> 04:35.531
You wanna stay alive, you gotta make a life
for yourself outside of your set.

04:35.565 --> 04:39.013
If you don't do that,
if you don't find an alternative,

04:39.047 --> 04:40.679
you're gonna die.

04:42.382 --> 04:46.310
If you want any kinda help,
if you want to talk, I'm here for you.

04:53.581 --> 04:55.075
Think about it.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.466
Man, the moon be playin' with me, dawg.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.334
Locked up at camp, used to look up
and see it all white and clean.

05:18.367 --> 05:22.752
And think how it's the same o'er here
in the hood, only it's all dirty and shit.

05:22.785 --> 05:25.608
Look, man, you back in the hood now, man.
You best forget that moon.

05:25.642 --> 05:28.423
Keep your eyes on this here street, man.
You're back, baby.

05:28.456 --> 05:31.325
Yo, I remember this poem said once,

05:31.358 --> 05:34.466
"The moon is a friend
for the Ionesome to talk to."

05:34.500 --> 05:36.031
Damn, girl.

05:36.489 --> 05:38.976
You got a poem for everything that come up.

05:39.010 --> 05:40.575
Didn't I tell you she was smart?

05:40.608 --> 05:42.883
Yeah, she so smart
why is she witchu, dawg?

05:42.916 --> 05:45.570
Ya know,
I ask myself that question all the time.

05:45.603 --> 05:47.712
There they go. There they go.

05:48.007 --> 05:51.619
Yo, lil' homeys. 9-5s just jacked
my lil' bro's bike. We gotta get it back.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.995
Yeah, man. Y'all got to come with us.

05:53.028 --> 05:55.035

to these niggas, man.

05:55.069 --> 05:58.257
Man, don't look to her
when there's work to be done, dawg.

05:58.290 --> 06:01.445
Look, man, I ain't got no heat.
I'm out here naked, man.

06:01.479 --> 06:03.964

06:03.998 --> 06:07.746
Man, what's the matter witcha'll two?

06:24.260 --> 06:26.267
Man, we wastin' time out here. Come on.

06:27.354 --> 06:31.104
Yo, man, this ain't no damn math quiz.
Is you ridin' or not?

06:31.138 --> 06:32.591

06:32.624 --> 06:34.553
- Come on, man.

06:34.586 --> 06:36.481
Put that shit away, man. Hurry up.

06:39.522 --> 06:41.911
Where these niggas at anyway, man?

06:56.192 --> 06:58.363
Shit, man, the damn niggas comin'...

06:58.397 --> 07:00.636
- Man, let's go.
- Come on, nigga!

07:01.344 --> 07:03.132
Shit! Damn!

07:05.695 --> 07:06.905
Damn it!

07:25.278 --> 07:26.488
Roger!

07:51.483 --> 07:53.337
Baby! Roger!

07:54.075 --> 07:55.285
Baby!

07:59.035 --> 08:00.441
Oh, God!

08:00.858 --> 08:04.851
I saw the whole damn thing, officer.
Destroying the community.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.350
Get all them damn gangs.

08:06.384 --> 08:07.505
Drac.

08:09.753 --> 08:11.155
Who did this?

08:11.188 --> 08:12.558
95s, man.

08:13.209 --> 08:14.552
One they call Klick.

08:14.586 --> 08:15.862
Yeah, all right.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.605
I know how it hurts. You and Raja
like lil' brothers to me, all right?

08:19.638 --> 08:21.666
We gotta do right by him.

08:21.699 --> 08:23.660
Me, I'll deal with Klick.

08:23.694 --> 08:25.195
You put in work on his brother.

08:25.229 --> 08:27.987
His name's Anthony.
Works nights, Parkside Market.

08:28.021 --> 08:30.771
Free, let me go wit 'im.
I want to smoke some 95s too, man.

08:30.804 --> 08:33.587
C- Co, this here is Drac's work. Right?

08:36.150 --> 08:37.361
For Raja.

08:40.246 --> 08:41.806
Oh, God!

08:42.549 --> 08:44.240
Oh, God!

08:51.669 --> 08:55.018
All right, put all reading and writing material
and games away.

08:55.051 --> 08:56.171
Hey, come on, homes.

08:56.205 --> 08:58.448
If I see it, it's confiscated.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.355
- Sean.
- What's goin' on?

09:03.188 --> 09:04.136
Back up a little bit.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.914
Roger Weathers got killed
in a drive-by today.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.240
I said don't rush me, bitch!

09:11.274 --> 09:12.908
See what happens?

09:13.331 --> 09:14.410
What?

09:16.883 --> 09:18.737
- Wassup?
- Get back! Enough! Come on!

09:18.771 --> 09:19.979
Wassup?

09:20.013 --> 09:21.456
Junior. Hey!

09:22.257 --> 09:23.547
To the box.

09:23.581 --> 09:24.838
I know the way.

09:25.841 --> 09:28.208
You get your hands
behind your back, mister.

09:28.241 --> 09:29.865
We got your back, homey.

09:29.898 --> 09:33.035
That's the third time in the box
this week for Junior.

09:33.069 --> 09:34.697
Back in your bunks.

09:34.730 --> 09:37.702
Anyone else wanna laugh and joke
with him in the box? Is that it?

09:37.736 --> 09:40.493
I'll send somebody's ass back to the box.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.837
Christ, Malcolm, what are we doin' here?

09:44.870 --> 09:47.148
We're like goddamn sheepherders.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.351
We fatten 'em up and put 'em right back
on the street where they get slaughtered.

09:50.384 --> 09:52.073
Tell me about it.

09:53.391 --> 09:55.495
We're not even makin' a dent.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.686
Willie!

10:15.789 --> 10:16.901
Willie!

10:33.962 --> 10:35.239
Where's Anthony at?

10:35.272 --> 10:36.647
In the back.

10:43.849 --> 10:45.278
Go, baby! Go!

10:47.785 --> 10:49.607
Don't do this, please.

10:50.056 --> 10:51.333
I got two little boys at home.

10:51.366 --> 10:52.548
For my dead homey!

10:52.581 --> 10:53.696
No, don't do this.

10:53.729 --> 10:55.939
Oh, my God, what are you do...

10:55.972 --> 10:57.252
Oh, shit!

10:57.640 --> 10:58.719
Damn!

11:15.910 --> 11:18.147
Where you been?
I thought somethin' happened to you.

11:18.180 --> 11:19.807
Naw, I'm a'ight.

11:20.102 --> 11:22.707
Bro, y'all gonna
shoot the boys killed Roger?

11:22.741 --> 11:25.313
Dewayne, why would you say...
Just shut up.

11:25.346 --> 11:26.690
'Sup, man?

11:27.013 --> 11:28.355
Come here.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.750
- Wassup, Ma?
- Here.

11:33.445 --> 11:34.426
What's this?

11:34.459 --> 11:37.085
- It was an accident.
- "Accident."

11:39.940 --> 11:43.616
Accident? Why you keep lettin' him
do this to you, Ma?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.458
Why you keep lettin' him back in here?

11:46.491 --> 11:48.569
Hey, hey, hey,
whyn't you stay outta this, boy.

11:48.603 --> 11:51.213
- Stay outta this?
- That's right. She know why she got it.

11:51.247 --> 11:53.824
- This my mother. This is my mother.
- Who you talking to?

11:53.858 --> 11:55.514
Naw, Mama, I'm sick of it!

11:55.547 --> 11:57.308
- You better calm him down.
- He come and go whenever he please,

11:57.342 --> 12:01.086
take your money and disappear
till he need more? I'm tired of this lowlife!

12:01.120 --> 12:02.942
- Stop!
- Get off, lowlife woman!

12:02.975 --> 12:04.250
I'm tired of this...

12:04.283 --> 12:06.241
Show me some respect, you little punk.

12:06.274 --> 12:08.126
Don't hit my son! Are you crazy?

12:08.159 --> 12:10.875
- You better show me my respect!
- Don't you put your hands on him!

12:10.909 --> 12:12.122
Get off!

12:16.896 --> 12:18.685
I told you, you hurt her again...

12:18.718 --> 12:20.955
You ain't got the balls to shoot me, boy.

12:20.988 --> 12:22.365
Just leave!

12:30.207 --> 12:35.323
Oh, God, no. No, no. No, no, no, no. No.
No, baby. No. No.

12:39.389 --> 12:40.666
He's dead.

13:21.945 --> 13:25.207
Listen, Paul, we convince a kid to stop
gangbanging, all we do is create a void.

13:25.657 --> 13:28.374
And unless we fill that void
with somethin' better, we're gonna lose 'em.

13:28.633 --> 13:31.924
According to the teaching staff,
the kids here have trouble being punctual,

13:31.958 --> 13:35.216
responding to authority, being a member
of a team, and accepting criticism.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.906
What one activity can improve 'em
on all these areas?

13:37.940 --> 13:40.365
- You wanna start a football team?
- Exactly.

13:40.398 --> 13:42.511
Sean, look at them.

13:42.544 --> 13:45.746
Our whole system's designed
to prevent them from making contact.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.342
Our whole system right now is a joke.

13:47.376 --> 13:49.780
Malcolm, you're not buying into this,
are you?

13:49.813 --> 13:52.878
Seventy-five percent of our kids
end up back in jail.

13:52.912 --> 13:54.029
How much worse could it be?

13:54.062 --> 13:55.485
Well, who are they gonna play against?

13:55.519 --> 13:56.875
I'll find 'em high school teams to play.

13:56.908 --> 13:58.770
Wait a minute,
you wanna take 'em out of the camp?

13:58.803 --> 14:00.430
You really think you can trust these kids?

14:00.463 --> 14:02.126
Not now, no.
But if they were a football team...

14:02.160 --> 14:04.400
Oh, come on, Sean. It's impossible.

14:04.433 --> 14:08.625
Then let's try the impossible,
because the possible just ain't workin'.

14:10.580 --> 14:13.646
Paul, we've got to give these kids a target
and we've gotta fill that void.

14:14.260 --> 14:16.168
You played football, didn't you?

14:16.201 --> 14:19.123
Defensive end. Second Team All League.

14:20.435 --> 14:22.671
All right, we'll give it a try.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.297
But your neck is way out on this.

15:23.277 --> 15:24.837
Mom, they have wheelchairs, ya know.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.665
- I'm okay.
- Thank you.

15:29.612 --> 15:34.216
Now, see, I've been tellin' you for years
you should coach.

15:34.891 --> 15:38.819
I know. I know, Mom, but I just think
with you sick, maybe it's not a good time.

15:38.853 --> 15:40.264
I completely agree.

15:40.298 --> 15:41.988
Why should you do something you love

15:42.021 --> 15:44.360
when you could be sittin' around
watchin' me fade away?

15:47.723 --> 15:50.307
So, what kinda offense you gonna run?

15:50.341 --> 15:52.132
I don't even know
if enough kids'll wanna play.

15:52.166 --> 15:55.583
Are you kiddin'?
Teenage boys'll kill to play football.

15:56.009 --> 15:58.376
That's what everybody's afraid of.

15:59.786 --> 16:02.120
Throw it in. Over here. Down low.

16:06.953 --> 16:09.287
Hey, yo, fetch me that ball, man.

16:10.024 --> 16:12.839
Yo, nigga, you deaf? I said gimme the ball.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.418
What, you can't talk neither?

16:16.839 --> 16:18.300
Yo, Junior.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.163
Take that ball, dawg.

16:20.903 --> 16:24.547
This cat think he king of Samoa 'cause
he killed some Mexican with a baseball bat.

16:24.581 --> 16:26.305
Yo, Junior, come on, man.

16:26.339 --> 16:28.029
Catch you on the fly, homey.

16:28.063 --> 16:29.509
Ball in, man.

16:32.038 --> 16:34.754
Whatchu looking at me foul like that for?

16:36.933 --> 16:37.915
I know you.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.158
You a goddamn 88.

16:40.741 --> 16:42.432
Yeah, that's right.

16:45.413 --> 16:47.388
You lucky we up in here.

16:47.421 --> 16:49.086
'Cause on the outs

16:49.764 --> 16:51.104
you'd be dead.

16:51.138 --> 16:53.659
I'll kill you right here, right now.

16:55.364 --> 16:57.305
All right, gentlemen, let's line it up.

16:57.339 --> 17:00.957
Owens, that's you too.
Come on, hurry up. Everybody.

17:02.947 --> 17:04.540
Hurry up. Move it.

17:05.954 --> 17:07.349
You wanna play football with this team,

17:07.383 --> 17:11.233
you're gonna live with the team,
eat with the team and work with the team.

17:11.266 --> 17:12.790
Is practice gonna be hard?

17:12.825 --> 17:15.580
It's a lot harder than five homeboys
beatin' up a security guard, Perez.

17:15.615 --> 17:17.023
Then I'm in.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.127
How 'bout you, Bates?

17:19.161 --> 17:20.182
I don't know.

17:20.215 --> 17:22.710
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared.

17:22.743 --> 17:24.246
You're on the team.

17:24.279 --> 17:26.041
Yo. I'll play quarterback.

17:26.075 --> 17:27.704
You got any experience, Leon?

17:27.738 --> 17:29.300
Man, I got so much experience

17:29.334 --> 17:33.020
I could give some away
and still have more than I could use.

17:34.368 --> 17:35.677
All right.

17:35.936 --> 17:36.982
I'll play.

17:37.016 --> 17:38.876
- I can't use you, Junior.
- Why not?

17:38.910 --> 17:42.171
'Cause you got no discipline. You'll be tryin'
to start fights every time I turn my back.

17:42.205 --> 17:43.449
You ain't even gonna give me a chance?

17:43.483 --> 17:44.893
You've had plenty of chances.

17:44.926 --> 17:46.202
Who else?

17:47.582 --> 17:49.075
How 'bout you, Owens?

17:49.109 --> 17:52.498
You played defensive back, didn't you?
For Washington?

17:53.310 --> 17:55.433
You wanna check your calendar
and get back to me?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.556
Or maybe you got
another liquor store to rob.

17:57.590 --> 17:59.024
Yeah, I'll play.

17:59.058 --> 18:00.725
How 'bout you, Evans?

18:00.758 --> 18:03.764
I mean, I played Pop Warner when
I was younger but that's about it, though.

18:03.797 --> 18:04.817
You're on the team.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.365
I got experience.
I played for, like, three years.

18:07.399 --> 18:09.551
- What position'd you play?
- Out to the side.

18:09.584 --> 18:11.704
Was that out to the side on offense
or defense?

18:11.737 --> 18:14.357
If the ball's thrown from...

18:15.420 --> 18:17.360
Man, I don't know what I'm talkin'.

18:17.394 --> 18:19.923
All right, Bug. How 'bout you be water boy?

18:19.956 --> 18:21.423
- Cool.
- All right.

18:21.456 --> 18:23.636
Yo, Mr. Porter. Can I play?

18:23.669 --> 18:25.560
You're getting out in a week, Madlock.

18:25.594 --> 18:26.673
I wanna stay in.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.174
You wanna stay in jail?

18:28.207 --> 18:30.866
Yeah, man.
South Central in summertime gets hot.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.588
Gets crazy.
People start shootin' each other and stuff.

18:33.621 --> 18:35.044
I'll talk to your case worker.

18:35.078 --> 18:36.843
- All right?
- All right.

18:36.877 --> 18:38.610
New booty? What's your name?

18:39.257 --> 18:40.685
Willie Weathers.

18:40.718 --> 18:43.127
Get vertical when you talk to me.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.309
You any relation to Roger Weathers?

18:48.343 --> 18:50.001
He was my cousin, man.

18:50.035 --> 18:52.209
I want you to play on this team, Willie.

18:52.243 --> 18:53.588
Naw, man, it's a'ight.

18:53.622 --> 18:55.248
You're playin'.

18:55.282 --> 18:56.463
Why?

18:56.497 --> 18:59.666
'Cause I want you to live longer
than your cousin.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.675
Hey. Who we gonna play against?

19:05.495 --> 19:06.836
We'll let ya know.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.211
All right.

19:08.854 --> 19:10.447
I'm gonna do my stuff, boy.

19:12.246 --> 19:15.311
Well, it's not a jail.
It's a juvenile detention center.

19:15.345 --> 19:17.203
But they're criminals?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.313
Yeah. Technically.

19:20.021 --> 19:21.547
Sorry, I can't.

19:21.581 --> 19:23.856
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Coach.

19:23.889 --> 19:26.655
Our players will be closely supervised,
no problems.

19:26.688 --> 19:29.420
Sounds fine,
as long as there's no gang members.

19:30.644 --> 19:33.546
See, that's the thing.
We don't have our own home field.

19:33.579 --> 19:35.211
So you expect to bring 'em here.

19:35.245 --> 19:37.585
Yeah, that's a great idea. We love your field.

19:37.618 --> 19:39.342
I'll come tomorrow.

19:39.635 --> 19:41.490
Sorry, guys, I don't think it's gonna work.

19:42.579 --> 19:45.361
Most of our starters
have been in this program for three years.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.886
You have four weeks to prepare your team.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.328
Do you really wanna go up
against those kinda odds?

19:49.362 --> 19:51.465
I'll bet ya $100 we win.

19:51.499 --> 19:54.188
We're a Christian school,
we don't gamble. I...

19:54.221 --> 19:55.533
Look, I have to be honest with ya.

19:55.567 --> 19:58.218
I don't think it's in the best interest
of my kids to play you.

19:58.252 --> 20:01.005
Well, what about our players?
Don't they deserve a chance to play?

20:01.039 --> 20:03.402
Well, frankly, no. They lost that chance
when they broke the law.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.766
Well, maybe we shouldn't let 'em eat, either.
How 'bout that?

20:05.800 --> 20:06.920
Sean.

20:08.112 --> 20:11.373
Mr. Torrance, let me ask you.
You a Christian, right?

20:11.888 --> 20:12.934
Yeah.

20:12.968 --> 20:16.039
Now, I'm not that familiar
with the exact words,

20:16.815 --> 20:19.170
but didn't Jesus say somethin' like,

20:19.204 --> 20:22.518
"Be merciful, just as your Father's merciful,

20:22.552 --> 20:25.833
"don't pass judgment
and you won't be judged"?

20:26.478 --> 20:28.300
It's the book of Luke.

20:28.494 --> 20:31.211
"Give and it'll be given in good measure.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.085
"For whatever measure
you deal out to others,

20:34.118 --> 20:36.524
"it'll be dealt to you in return."

20:37.837 --> 20:40.040
You're not too familiar with it, huh?

20:40.073 --> 20:43.433
No, look, Bob and Mel said it's fine
with them if it's fine with you.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.409
I didn't know you were religious.

20:45.442 --> 20:49.771
I ain't religious, but we need
all the help we can get for this program.

20:50.924 --> 20:53.771
Wouldn't hurt for you to pray some yourself.

20:54.924 --> 20:58.568
Well, scheduling games
on Saturday afternoon,

20:58.601 --> 21:00.063
it isn't easy,

21:00.523 --> 21:02.977
but I think I just got you a full schedule.

21:03.010 --> 21:05.154
- Thank you.
- Welcome to the Camino Real League.

21:05.188 --> 21:06.371
Hey, thanks a lot.

21:06.602 --> 21:07.894
Take a knee, half-circle.

21:07.928 --> 21:09.153
Everybody take a knee.

21:09.187 --> 21:10.502
Gentlemen, we ain't got all day.

21:10.535 --> 21:11.944
Bring it in.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.903
All right, everybody, listen up.

21:14.937 --> 21:16.773
Whatever neighborhood you came from,

21:16.807 --> 21:18.483
whatever gang you claim,

21:18.516 --> 21:20.203
whatever hood you're from,

21:20.237 --> 21:21.857
this is your hood now.

21:21.891 --> 21:24.863
You're no longer a Blood, no longer a Crip,

21:25.609 --> 21:27.156
no longer an esé.

21:27.189 --> 21:28.702
You're Mustang.

21:29.352 --> 21:32.286
This football program will be three-pronged.

21:32.319 --> 21:34.116
Number one, the dorm.

21:34.759 --> 21:37.726
You're gonna have to learn to get along
with people from other neighborhoods.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.376
Different backgrounds.

21:39.410 --> 21:40.994
Number two, school.

21:41.703 --> 21:45.379
You're gonna have to apply yourself.
Become a better student.

21:45.574 --> 21:47.810
And number three, the gridiron.

21:48.262 --> 21:50.388
Hey, Coach. What's the gridiron?

21:50.421 --> 21:52.636
You're standin' on the gridiron.

21:52.669 --> 21:54.862
The gridiron is a football field.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.177
On the gridiron, we play football.

21:57.211 --> 21:59.459
On the gridiron, we do it my way.

22:00.357 --> 22:02.113
Not your way, my way.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.255
Your way got you here.

22:04.289 --> 22:06.877
And you're here 'cause ya lost.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.890
Right now, you're losers.

22:10.212 --> 22:12.601
Mustangs are winners.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.994
And if you accept this challenge,

22:17.891 --> 22:20.225
when it's all over come December,

22:22.435 --> 22:24.344
you're gonna be winners.

22:26.978 --> 22:30.720
All right, let's go. Let's have
a good first day of practice. Jumpin' jacks.

22:30.754 --> 22:33.119
Everybody ready? Get set!

22:34.722 --> 22:35.867
Begin.

22:36.513 --> 22:37.894
M- U-S-T-A...

22:41.313 --> 22:42.585
- T!
- A!

22:42.619 --> 22:43.859
A- N-G-S!

22:49.696 --> 22:53.176
You've got to be shittin' me.
You don't know how to spell "Mustangs"?

22:53.209 --> 22:55.516
This is gonna be a long-ass day.

23:03.359 --> 23:05.879
Evans, what in the blue hell is that?

23:09.214 --> 23:10.293
Get up, Evans!

23:10.326 --> 23:12.885
I bet ya there's a piece-a chicken down there
you'd go for it, wouldn't ya?

23:12.918 --> 23:14.067
Hell, yeah, Coach. I love chicken.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.417
Then get your ass down there
on my whistle.

23:15.451 --> 23:17.754
On my whistle, get that chicken.

23:18.717 --> 23:20.986
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it.
Get your feet pumpin'.

23:21.020 --> 23:23.124
Feet pumpin'. You got pride.

23:25.532 --> 23:27.093
Bend your knees.

23:30.332 --> 23:31.412
Damn.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.190
Concentrate. Focus.

23:37.819 --> 23:40.405
- Little lower, Bates.
- Bend your knees.

23:41.307 --> 23:43.576
You up for the challenge, Bates?

23:45.274 --> 23:47.030
Good job. Thatta boy.

23:47.418 --> 23:49.873
All right, Bug, let's get a water break. Bug.

23:49.907 --> 23:52.280
All right, good job. Bring it in.

23:54.073 --> 23:55.447
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.000
Y'all don't behave, y'all gonna die of thirst.
Y'all got that?

23:58.034 --> 24:00.528
All right?
Hey, hey, I gotta do it, I gotta do it.

24:00.562 --> 24:02.640
Here y'all go, here y'all go. All right, now.

24:02.673 --> 24:04.533
Y'all doin' good out there,
that's what I like to see.

24:04.566 --> 24:05.300
M- U-S-T-A-N-G-S!

24:10.263 --> 24:12.914
Mustangs! Mustangs! Mustangs!

24:18.423 --> 24:21.838
Come on, bring it! Hustle.
Touch that line and get back!

24:22.614 --> 24:25.069
Way to go, Leon! Think you got that!

24:25.334 --> 24:29.196
You ain't cheatin' me,
you're cheatin' yourself. Behind the line.

24:30.741 --> 24:32.268
- Let's go!
- All the way through.

24:32.302 --> 24:34.992
Come on, Weathers! Hustle!
Get down here, Weathers! Good job!

24:35.025 --> 24:37.515
Good job. Now, get back!
Good hustle, come on!

24:37.549 --> 24:40.403
Come on, Weathers. Come on.
All the way through, Willie!

24:40.436 --> 24:42.541
Come on, Kelvin. Get 'im!

24:53.683 --> 24:56.650
Look at you go, Evans! I like that! I like it!

24:56.979 --> 24:58.441
Touch the line!

24:58.962 --> 25:01.809
Evans, this is wind sprints, not wind walks.

25:04.082 --> 25:06.252
All the way through, Evans.
Come on, come on. Come on.

25:06.286 --> 25:09.484
- I'm too tired.
- You're too tired, my ass. You're too lazy.

25:09.517 --> 25:11.756
But that's gonna change. I promise you
that's gonna change, come on.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.527
Come on, back in line.
Through the line, Evans.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.264
Man, I quit, dawg.
I had enough of this shit, man.

25:17.297 --> 25:18.856
Y'all niggas is trippin'.

25:18.889 --> 25:21.863
Five hundred degrees
and y'all doin' wind sprints?

25:21.896 --> 25:23.430
If you can't accept the challenge,

25:23.463 --> 25:26.831
then you're not good enough to call
yourself a Mustang, Evans. You hear me?

25:26.865 --> 25:30.063
You wanna come back out here,
we'll be out here workin' our asses off.

25:30.096 --> 25:33.261
You wanna come back out, make sure you
bring a heart with you next time.

25:33.294 --> 25:35.268
What's everybody lookin' at?
Who else wants to quit?

25:35.301 --> 25:38.026
Come on, Bates. We're almost done, Bates.
Don't quit on me.

25:38.059 --> 25:39.883
Hand on the line. On my whistle.

25:39.917 --> 25:41.673
All the way through,
touch the line and get back.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.524
Come on, Bates. This is where we
win the game, in the fourth quarter.

25:44.557 --> 25:47.437
You will be mentally tough
when this is done.

25:48.910 --> 25:50.797
All right, bring it in.

25:51.213 --> 25:53.449
Great practice, great practice.

25:54.765 --> 25:56.740
Way to work, way to work.

25:57.197 --> 26:00.099
Everybody in close. Get in close.
Take a knee.

26:02.284 --> 26:05.862
You guys worked really hard this week.
You should be proud.

26:07.371 --> 26:09.859
You haven't heard that a whole lot,
have you?

26:09.892 --> 26:11.525
You've earned it.

26:12.364 --> 26:15.975
Boys, it's a whole new world out there
when you earn things.

26:17.611 --> 26:19.686
All right, bring it in.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.762
Everybody in. Everybody in.

26:22.794 --> 26:24.681
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

26:24.715 --> 26:25.988
Mustangs!

26:26.022 --> 26:30.596
Jog it off the field. Jog it off!
You want water? It's on the sidelines. Jog!

26:33.833 --> 26:37.216
Three weeks from this Saturday, we open
our season against Barrington High School.

26:37.249 --> 26:38.302
They any good?

26:38.336 --> 26:40.164
They've only lost five games in three years.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.142
We about to make it six.

26:42.888 --> 26:45.156
All right, all right, listen up.

26:45.189 --> 26:47.874
Madlock, look up here. I want you to tell me
what the offense is tryin' to do.

26:47.908 --> 26:49.732
Which is the offense?

26:50.119 --> 26:51.165
The O's.

26:51.199 --> 26:52.928
Man, I don't know what all this shit mean.

26:52.961 --> 26:56.336
It means, "Have a nice day"
in Japanese, Madlock.

26:56.370 --> 26:59.710
Naw, man, Japanese for "Nissan Sentra,"
right, Bates?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.210
What does that mean, Bates?

27:01.244 --> 27:03.870
Bates jacked a Nissan Sentra.
That's why he's here.

27:03.904 --> 27:08.130
It's sad. If you gonna jack a car,
jack a Mercedes or a BMW.

27:08.164 --> 27:12.670
If you jack a Sentra, you gotta drive
backwards so nobody can see your face.

27:15.685 --> 27:17.440
All right, listen up.

27:43.138 --> 27:44.993
You got a pass, Junior?

27:46.370 --> 27:47.930
I had a phone call.

27:47.964 --> 27:49.212
From who?

27:51.009 --> 27:53.081
It's my boy's birthday, man.

27:54.113 --> 27:55.804
He's two years old.

27:58.497 --> 28:00.918
He's two years old and I missed it.

28:10.975 --> 28:13.080
I wanna be a Mustang, Coach.

28:13.599 --> 28:15.454
Why should I trust you?

28:15.935 --> 28:17.046
'Cause I ain't gonna mess up.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.874
That's what you told the judge
the last time you got out.

28:18.908 --> 28:20.152
No more.

28:21.374 --> 28:23.610
I'm tired of bein' a loser, man.

28:24.222 --> 28:26.294
Makin' a mess of everything.

28:27.102 --> 28:31.292
Coach, I wanna show people I can play.
I can do somethin' with my life.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.825
I just wanna make my son proud.

28:41.372 --> 28:44.022
Take it half speed till we get it right.

28:44.732 --> 28:45.960
Set.

28:45.994 --> 28:47.190
Hut!

28:49.499 --> 28:51.798
Junior. Junior. Junior. Junior!

28:51.831 --> 28:53.622
Hey, get back. Madlock, get back.

28:53.656 --> 28:55.381
Just 'cause we call it a run-through

28:55.415 --> 28:56.944
doesn't mean you run through
your own men.

28:56.978 --> 28:58.479
No contact till we get equipment.

28:58.512 --> 29:00.920
- Look out for Junior.
- Wait till you get some pads.

29:00.954 --> 29:02.294
Bug, give 'em water.

29:02.328 --> 29:05.229
I'll be down with it, Coach!
Come on, guys, let's go!

29:05.263 --> 29:09.014
Coach, how 'bout you have that water boy
go fill up the swimmin' pool?

29:09.048 --> 29:11.088
Let us do a little backstroke
before we get heatstroke.

29:11.121 --> 29:13.168
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll put a quart of water in that pool

29:13.201 --> 29:14.189
for every pass you complete.

29:14.222 --> 29:15.954
- How 'bout that?
- Okay, that's what's up.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.577
Drink it up, drink it up, drink it up.

29:21.272 --> 29:23.181
You want some water, 88?

29:27.480 --> 29:30.197
My dead homeys drink water before you do.

29:31.959 --> 29:34.479
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all doing good out there.
What I like to see!

29:34.513 --> 29:36.831
Keep it up, I'll provide some extra water.

29:36.864 --> 29:39.148
Now that's a funny kid. He always smilin'.

29:39.182 --> 29:40.399
It's all about the water, man.

29:40.432 --> 29:44.495
I wonder if he was smilin'
when he stabbed that old lady for her purse.

29:44.529 --> 29:45.654
Here ya go.

29:46.358 --> 29:48.096
Junior, Willie, is that your positions?

29:48.130 --> 29:49.836
Let's go. Leon, let's see what you got.

29:49.869 --> 29:51.283
Green 18!

29:51.316 --> 29:53.769
Green 18! Hut!

30:10.931 --> 30:11.879
What was that about?

30:11.913 --> 30:13.263
Man, just send me to the box!

30:13.296 --> 30:15.948
No, you start trouble on a football field,
we finish it on a football field!

30:15.981 --> 30:17.360
- I ain't doin' shit wit 'im!
- Why not?

30:17.394 --> 30:18.570
Was his set smoked Raja!

30:18.604 --> 30:20.583
- 88s killed my best friend!
- Shut up!

30:20.617 --> 30:21.967
How long your sets been at war?

30:22.001 --> 30:23.113
Ancient times, dude.

30:23.147 --> 30:24.744
How'd it get started? You even know?

30:24.778 --> 30:26.093
They started that shit, dawg!

30:26.127 --> 30:28.429
- Man, that's a goddamn lie!
- Shut up!

30:28.463 --> 30:30.491
Willie, lemme ask you something.

30:30.525 --> 30:32.520
How'd you feel when Roger died?

30:32.554 --> 30:33.967
Did you cry?

30:36.816 --> 30:38.092
How 'bout you, Kelvin?

30:38.125 --> 30:41.291
How did you feel
when your friend was killed? Did you cry?

30:41.324 --> 30:42.766
Yes, sir, I did.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.351
Yeah. So it's just gonna
go on like this forever?

30:45.384 --> 30:49.579
Killin' each other 'cause ya live
five blocks in the wrong direction?

30:50.735 --> 30:53.255
How 'bout we call a peace right here?

30:55.631 --> 30:57.604
God damn it, why not?

30:57.638 --> 31:01.572
I mean, we just, like, little gangsters.
It wouldn't even mean nothin'.

31:01.606 --> 31:05.507
It'd mean somethin' here. Right here,
right now, it would mean somethin'.

31:09.069 --> 31:11.207
Paul, a delay in funding?

31:11.240 --> 31:13.675
Well, there's a lot of red tape
and paperwork we gotta...

31:13.709 --> 31:15.397
How are we supposed
to play without equipment?

31:15.431 --> 31:17.736
I just read Willie Weathers' file.
Have you seen it?

31:17.770 --> 31:18.753
Yeah, what about it?

31:18.786 --> 31:21.282
We had an agreement.
No killers on the football team, right?

31:21.315 --> 31:23.843
Dexter, if there's more than five kids
on that team that aren't killers,

31:23.876 --> 31:24.864
it's because they have lousy aim.

31:24.898 --> 31:26.760
- They're not in here for that.
- 'Cause they didn't get caught.

31:26.794 --> 31:27.841
But Weathers did.

31:27.874 --> 31:31.624
And I'm workin' my ass off to make sure
he doesn't kill anybody again!

31:31.657 --> 31:33.000
You sure that's it?

31:33.033 --> 31:34.178
What?

31:34.212 --> 31:36.137
Well, you were a college football star.
Maybe this team is...

31:36.171 --> 31:39.136
Dexter, your degree was in social work,
not psychology.

31:39.170 --> 31:41.000
We need that equipment.

31:44.553 --> 31:45.567
Guy's outta control.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.520
Not now I'm not. But soon, very soon!

31:49.993 --> 31:52.164
Come on, show us what you got!

31:52.905 --> 31:55.425
Come on, buddy! Throw it!
No, no, no, no, no!

31:55.458 --> 31:56.510
Evade!

31:56.544 --> 31:57.598
Come on, man!

31:57.631 --> 31:59.046
You gotta be kiddin' me! Hold on, hold on!

31:59.079 --> 32:00.093
Cut it out.

32:00.126 --> 32:03.462
For three days, we been runnin' this play.
You still don't know where you're goin'!

32:03.495 --> 32:07.008
Get your asses on the line and do it again,
and do it right! Line it up!

32:07.041 --> 32:09.153
Coach, you said we'd have a water break.

32:09.187 --> 32:11.265
Not until you do it right. Line it up!

32:11.298 --> 32:12.927
Line it up! Move!

32:16.710 --> 32:17.953
Weathers, get up.

32:17.987 --> 32:20.094
Not till we get some water.

32:57.346 --> 32:59.254
Bug, give 'em some water.

32:59.287 --> 33:01.727
- Here you go, boys!
- Finally did something as a team.

33:03.042 --> 33:06.522
The water man's back in town.
Here you guys go.

33:07.265 --> 33:09.784
These kids have never worked hard
for anything in their life.

33:09.818 --> 33:13.483
And teamwork. Teamwork to them
is four homeboys robbin' a liquor store.

33:13.516 --> 33:17.115
So I gotta push 'em. But I know
if I push 'em too hard I'll lose 'em.

33:17.149 --> 33:21.493
You couldn't expect 'em to work as hard
as you did. Not right off the bat.

33:21.526 --> 33:23.541
Now, see, you had a God-given talent.

33:23.575 --> 33:26.615
The minute you put on a helmet,
you were a star.

33:26.648 --> 33:28.760
I always had faith in you.

33:29.183 --> 33:31.309
You're my mom. That's your job.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.435
I'm your mom, that's my job.

33:34.558 --> 33:36.189
Well, here we are.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.819
Home sweet home.

33:42.109 --> 33:43.353
Junior?

33:49.501 --> 33:51.191
Who needs helmets?

33:54.236 --> 33:57.083
Bug, give this to somebody who can use it.

33:57.117 --> 33:59.057
Now, that's more like it.

34:03.451 --> 34:06.615
Damn, J-dawg,
that's destruction of state property.

34:08.889 --> 34:10.483
What the hell is this?

34:10.516 --> 34:12.016
A nose guard.

34:14.331 --> 34:16.304
It's for your balls, dawg.

34:20.538 --> 34:22.447
Man, that's for pussies.

34:31.672 --> 34:32.717
Let's get it on!

34:32.752 --> 34:34.996
Five tight, 32 dive. Run it.

34:35.704 --> 34:36.752
Set.

34:37.496 --> 34:38.739
Green 18!

34:38.773 --> 34:39.822
Hut!

34:45.783 --> 34:47.346
Madlock, what happened?

34:47.380 --> 34:48.909
He broke my biscuits, man.

34:49.431 --> 34:51.536
Broke your biscuits.
Are you wearin' your cup?

34:51.569 --> 34:52.255
No.

34:53.079 --> 34:57.137
Naw, he ain't wearin' his cup.
Because cups are for pussies!

34:58.998 --> 35:03.732
Hey, yo, Coach.
I think I need to go back to the gym.

35:03.766 --> 35:05.870
- You gotta go back to the gym?
- Yes, sir.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.796
Put your cup on, maybe?

35:08.693 --> 35:09.837
Yeah, me too.

35:09.871 --> 35:12.624
Get goin', Willie.
Anybody else forget to put their cups on?

35:12.657 --> 35:14.415
Yeah. Half the team.

35:14.996 --> 35:17.167
Come on, Madlock, walk it off.

35:17.556 --> 35:18.700
Walk it off, Madlock.

35:18.733 --> 35:19.982
Yeah, limp it off, Madlock.

35:20.015 --> 35:21.262
Hey, Coach.

35:21.296 --> 35:24.909
I got mine on but it ain't nowhere
near big enough to hold me.

35:24.942 --> 35:26.701
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I need the extra-large, Coach.

35:26.735 --> 35:29.868
Well, come here, tiny. Let me talk to you
for a second. Y'all get back to work.

35:29.902 --> 35:32.208
All right, line it up, gentlemen.

35:33.970 --> 35:35.497
What's up, Coach?

35:35.530 --> 35:38.202
Last year, when you were dealing crack,

35:38.235 --> 35:40.873
I heard that you made five times my salary.

35:40.907 --> 35:42.458
And I ain't paid no taxes.

35:42.491 --> 35:43.975
- No taxes?
- No taxes.

35:44.008 --> 35:46.088
Means you're pretty good
at math, memorization.

35:46.122 --> 35:47.622
Yeah, I'm pretty friendly wit it.

35:47.656 --> 35:48.907
Here's the problem.

35:48.941 --> 35:51.791
I'm worried about Madlock
not being able to learn our playbook.

35:51.824 --> 35:53.099
What's that got to do wit me?

35:53.132 --> 35:56.070
If he can't learn it, he doesn't play,
which means he doesn't block for you,

35:56.103 --> 36:00.005
which then means I'm gonna have
to put in Aguilar to protect you.

36:06.895 --> 36:07.876
I see, Coach.

36:07.910 --> 36:10.088
- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.

36:10.121 --> 36:12.395
Get back to work. Come on.

36:12.428 --> 36:13.639
Let's go!

36:13.672 --> 36:16.076
Mr. Porter, can I talk to you?

36:16.110 --> 36:17.833
I tried to tell ya.

36:18.606 --> 36:19.980
Hey, Dexter.

36:20.461 --> 36:23.047
You signed for $10,000 worth of equipment?

36:23.080 --> 36:24.229
We got a helluva deal.

36:24.263 --> 36:25.991
You're not authorized to do that.

36:26.024 --> 36:27.522
Really? I thought I was.

36:27.556 --> 36:29.253
You're gonna get suspended,
you know that, right?

36:29.287 --> 36:31.593
Yeah, I know, but first you're gonna
have to write up a 784,

36:31.626 --> 36:32.968
and then they're gonna schedule a hearing,

36:33.002 --> 36:35.140
which I'm gonna have to postpone
due to a family illness,

36:35.174 --> 36:38.342
then I'm gonna appeal that ruling, and
by that time, the season's gonna be over.

36:38.375 --> 36:41.280
Look, Dexter, the equipment's used already,
we can't give it back.

36:41.314 --> 36:44.104
Let's just give the kids what they worked
really, really hard for, huh?

36:49.866 --> 36:52.932
I got a Mustang football T-shirt
for you, Dexter.

36:53.738 --> 36:55.494
Get 'em goin', Coach.

37:00.777 --> 37:03.079
Madlock, I'm gonna work witchu
'cause you got what it takes.

37:03.112 --> 37:06.461
I'mma just, you know what I'm sayin',
get you together.

37:06.495 --> 37:08.772
Hey, watch out, man! We workin' here!

37:08.806 --> 37:12.189
Come on, Madlock, just stand in front of me,
don't let nobody hit me.

37:12.222 --> 37:15.264
You gonna come see me play?
See Daddy play football?

37:15.298 --> 37:16.797
Hey, Weathers.

37:17.512 --> 37:19.137
You got a visitor.

37:19.496 --> 37:21.187
- Danyelle!
- Willie.

37:26.759 --> 37:28.100
Damn, girl.

37:29.799 --> 37:30.976
How'd you get here?

37:31.010 --> 37:32.027
Bus.

37:32.061 --> 37:35.200
Bus? It's musta taken you
like two days, huh?

37:35.233 --> 37:36.480
Seemed like it.

37:36.513 --> 37:38.523
Seemed... Seemed like it.

37:40.358 --> 37:41.950
Well, I'm really glad you here.

37:41.983 --> 37:45.314
Why don't you move your fat ass to another
table with your McDonald's and shit?

37:45.348 --> 37:47.290
I know you not gonna disrespect me
in front of my family!

37:47.323 --> 37:48.313
Jermaine, let it go!

37:48.741 --> 37:50.243
Get off me!

37:50.277 --> 37:51.714
Settle down!

37:51.747 --> 37:52.827
You want your family to go home?

37:52.860 --> 37:54.460
Man, settle down!

37:55.748 --> 37:58.017
What's up, mija?
You wanna swing low on this or what?

37:58.050 --> 37:59.937
Hey, yo, shut your ass up, Peavy!

37:59.971 --> 38:01.377
Willie, Willie, Willie, don't do that!

38:01.699 --> 38:03.324
- Nah, you ain't nothin' but a bluff, nigga!
- No! Come on!

38:03.358 --> 38:06.264
Man, you a bluff.
See you when you get out the box.

38:06.297 --> 38:09.054
Don't even worry about him.
I'll take care of him later on, all right?

38:09.088 --> 38:11.424
Come on, let's go sit down.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.831
I wanna go.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.807
You wanna go?

38:16.770 --> 38:19.552
How you gonna take care of him, Willie?

38:19.585 --> 38:21.308
You gonna kill him?

38:22.593 --> 38:23.837
Danyelle.

38:24.417 --> 38:25.944
Come on, girl.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.701
Mom, you can't just get up and leave.

38:27.734 --> 38:30.677
Just don't look at me like that, all right?
Whaddya want me to do about it?

38:30.711 --> 38:34.778
I'm not the one who put you here, all right?
You put yourself here.

38:35.936 --> 38:37.180
Damn it.

39:10.300 --> 39:12.307
What's goin' on, buddy?

39:12.341 --> 39:13.754
It's my mom.

39:16.092 --> 39:18.230
Things are just so messed up.

39:19.771 --> 39:21.681
Gets so I just hate her.

39:25.083 --> 39:26.544
No, you don't.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.836
Just want my mom to love me, you know?

39:39.193 --> 39:40.338
I know.

39:41.241 --> 39:42.419
I know.

39:49.912 --> 39:52.050
You know what I was thinkin'?

39:53.272 --> 39:55.606
'Bout we try you out at receiver?

39:58.007 --> 40:00.625
You mean, like, I'd be catchin' the ball?

40:00.659 --> 40:02.834
Sometimes. Mostly blockin'.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.462
That'd be cool.

40:04.496 --> 40:05.777
Why don't you get your playbook.

40:05.810 --> 40:08.267
I'll meet ya up here.
We'll go over some plays.

40:08.301 --> 40:10.676
- All right. Right now?
- Right now.

40:27.764 --> 40:32.553
You guys got any letters to go out before
the weekend, I gotta screen 'em tonight.

40:33.972 --> 40:35.433
Dear Danyelle.

40:36.403 --> 40:38.890
Look, I'm sorry you felt bad here.

40:38.924 --> 40:42.224
I don't like it either but I'm tryin' to change.

40:43.154 --> 40:45.030
My mama moved to Oakland.

40:45.064 --> 40:48.815
She don't want my little brother
havin' nothin' to do with me.

40:50.450 --> 40:54.705
Danyelle, you're the only one
who cares anything about me.

40:55.281 --> 40:57.670
The only really good person I know.

40:58.450 --> 41:00.205
Please write me back.

41:04.784 --> 41:08.046
Let's go. It's that 28 toss, Leon.
Get 'em goin'. It's a big play for us.

41:08.079 --> 41:10.085
Come on, Weathers, show me your wheels.

41:10.119 --> 41:13.323
Let's see what you got, defense.
Kelvin, lemme see.

41:20.751 --> 41:23.238
Kelvin, good job, good job.
Way to get in there.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.560
Come on, Weathers, you're better than that!

41:25.593 --> 41:27.815
Don't worry 'bout it, man. Hey, you'll get it.

41:27.849 --> 41:30.056
All right, let's go! Run that same play.
Let's go!

41:30.090 --> 41:31.337
I'm so tired, man.

41:31.370 --> 41:34.404
Rather fight five angry niggas
than mess with this football shit.

41:34.438 --> 41:38.535
Quit bitchin', quit moanin'!
We've got five days till we play Barrington.

41:38.569 --> 41:40.710
If you don't get this stuff down,
if you don't get it right,

41:40.744 --> 41:42.137
they're gonna kick your asses.

41:42.171 --> 41:43.713
Can't nobody kick our ass, Coach.

41:43.746 --> 41:45.221
Yeah, no, clearly, Junior. Yeah.

41:45.255 --> 41:47.845
After what I just saw from Weathers,
you guys are gonna run over everybody.

41:47.878 --> 41:48.931
Run the play!

41:48.965 --> 41:50.248
Ten hut!

41:53.708 --> 41:55.267
They all pussies, Coach.

41:55.301 --> 41:58.470
You better let me play
or else we ain't gonna win.

41:58.763 --> 42:00.192
Shut up, Bug.

42:01.291 --> 42:05.033
All right, we're runnin' this play to Junior.
L- five toss, Junior.

42:05.066 --> 42:06.144
Run it, Leon.

42:06.178 --> 42:09.316
Gray 10. Gray 10. Hut!

42:10.346 --> 42:14.372
Come on, Junior. Let's see
what you got, Junior. Go! Go, Junior! Go!

42:17.929 --> 42:19.522
Hey, come on, man.

42:20.041 --> 42:22.692
Hey, Coach! He down, man, come on!

42:23.369 --> 42:24.895
Back up. Junior.

42:25.864 --> 42:28.002
Junior, talk to me. You okay?

42:28.744 --> 42:30.467
Talk to me, Junior.

42:31.975 --> 42:35.041
I don't know what's wrong
if you don't talk to me.

42:36.935 --> 42:39.553
We're gonna get you to a hospital,
get you all taken care of,

42:39.586 --> 42:42.044
everything'll be okay, you hear me?

42:52.326 --> 42:54.017
He gonna be a'ight.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.860
See you tonight.

43:08.484 --> 43:09.793
Listen up.

43:10.916 --> 43:12.671
We just got back from the hospital.

43:12.705 --> 43:17.027
The good news is Junior's gonna
walk outta there, he's gonna be okay.

43:19.363 --> 43:20.474
The bad news,

43:20.507 --> 43:23.229
he has a concussion and a slipped disk.

43:25.059 --> 43:27.425
Without Junior we gonna suck, man.

43:28.802 --> 43:31.672
Well, that's up to you, Leon. And you, Bates.

43:33.057 --> 43:36.602
And you, Willie. Madlock, Perez, Kelvin.

43:37.793 --> 43:41.884
It's up to all of you. Then we'll find out
what this team is made of.

43:42.593 --> 43:46.422
You gotta imagine there's a goal post
right there to the right and to the left.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.142
Good job!

43:50.656 --> 43:52.564
Everybody in. Take your helmets off.

43:52.598 --> 43:55.900
Circle it up. Circle up the wagons.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

43:55.934 --> 43:58.301
Great practice, great practice.

43:58.335 --> 43:59.741
Take a knee.

44:01.983 --> 44:05.725
Next time you put those helmets on,
it'll be for real.

44:05.758 --> 44:08.156
Learn your assignments, get ready.

44:12.829 --> 44:14.519
- Madlock.
- That's my homey, man.

44:14.553 --> 44:18.363
These are your homeys. You're not gonna
do 'em any good in the box! Sit down!

44:18.397 --> 44:19.770
Chill, man.

44:26.524 --> 44:27.952
Yo, whatch'all niggas lookin' at?

44:27.985 --> 44:30.995
Y'all a buncha busters and shit!
Doin' everything they tell you.

44:31.028 --> 44:35.224
Run, jump, roll over. Like little pets.
Little pussy pets.

44:35.644 --> 44:38.610
Man, shut the hell up, Peavy!
Yeah, you the pussy.

44:38.643 --> 44:40.854
Man, you ain't got half-a what it takes
to play football.

44:40.887 --> 44:42.439
Keep walkin', Peavy.

44:42.472 --> 44:43.990
What's up, Mustangs?

44:47.674 --> 44:51.983
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, yo.
I got injuries.

44:52.602 --> 44:54.641
Hey, Junior, what's up, man?

44:56.185 --> 44:58.007
That's enough, though.

45:02.488 --> 45:04.463
When I was in the hospital,

45:06.200 --> 45:08.655
I thought a lot about you guys, man.

45:09.176 --> 45:10.550
The team.

45:12.216 --> 45:14.386
How you guys are like my family.

45:14.419 --> 45:17.454
And I wanted to show my family
what I could do.

45:20.087 --> 45:23.403
I just wish I could play witchu guys
on Saturday, man.

45:24.503 --> 45:26.193
But I'll be there.

45:26.646 --> 45:28.915
I know you guys are gonna kick ass, right?

45:34.133 --> 45:36.004
Bring it in, y'all, come on.

45:36.038 --> 45:37.876
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

45:37.910 --> 45:39.882
I want it loud and clear.

45:39.916 --> 45:42.290
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

45:42.324 --> 45:43.600
Mustangs!

45:48.276 --> 45:49.836
Come on, guys! Let's do this!

45:50.452 --> 45:53.299
That's what I'm talkin' about! Let's do it.

45:59.922 --> 46:01.928
We got a ass-kickin' for Barrington
waitin' for 'em.

46:01.962 --> 46:05.547
We're gonna see
what you're made of, Weathers. On the bus.

46:14.705 --> 46:16.331
Y'all ready, baby?

46:22.160 --> 46:23.305
Evans.

46:31.215 --> 46:32.676
Still wanna be a Mustang?

46:32.710 --> 46:36.939
Of course I do. But I can't fulfill
the physical requirements, Coach.

46:36.973 --> 46:40.137
Evans, you don't have to be an athlete
to be a Mustang.

46:40.171 --> 46:41.548
Look at me.

46:42.351 --> 46:45.699
You just gotta have heart.
I know you have heart.

46:47.598 --> 46:50.947
We could use an equipment manager.
You interested?

46:50.980 --> 46:53.029
Hell, yeah, I'm interested!

46:53.062 --> 46:54.377
Come on.

46:54.410 --> 46:55.851
Can I get
one of these Mustang shirts, though?

46:55.884 --> 46:59.396
Oh, it's a lot of fabric, but yes.
Gimme some time to find your size.

46:59.430 --> 47:02.762
Hey, Mustangs.
Meet the new equipment manager, Evans.

47:05.132 --> 47:09.572
I'm tellin' you, Barrington about to get their
ass whooped when we step on the field.

47:09.606 --> 47:12.521
'Ey. Don't forget,
you work for me now, Jermaine.

47:12.555 --> 47:15.302
Shit, man, long as I don't gotta run,
I'll call you "boss," homey.

47:15.336 --> 47:16.515
You know what I'm sayin'?

47:16.549 --> 47:19.139
Hey! Look at the girl in the Mustang.

47:19.172 --> 47:20.552
Where?

47:20.906 --> 47:22.051
Damn!

47:22.474 --> 47:26.467
Hey, I'd like to run a quarterback sneak
right into your end zone!

47:32.777 --> 47:36.224
Hey, she wavin' at me! She wavin' at me!
She want me bad!

47:47.816 --> 47:50.947
Jesus Christ, man.
You got this all messed up.

47:51.816 --> 47:54.368
How many times we do this in practice?

47:58.023 --> 48:00.357
All right, bring it in. Let's go.

48:09.734 --> 48:12.450
This is it. The day you been waitin' for.

48:15.173 --> 48:17.594
I know you're nervous. So am I.

48:18.308 --> 48:19.736
My first game too.

48:19.770 --> 48:23.073
Now it's time to go out there
and put it on the scoreboard.

48:23.107 --> 48:26.140
Now it's time to see who has the heart.

48:27.172 --> 48:32.157
Now is the time to prove to yourselves
and prove to everyone out there

48:32.191 --> 48:34.562
that even though you're locked up,

48:36.355 --> 48:37.980
you are somebody.

48:38.851 --> 48:41.120
And you are worthy of something!

48:41.954 --> 48:46.874
And you're able to do something special
that no one else in the world can do,

48:46.908 --> 48:49.334
which you can walk through those doors,
hold your heads up high

48:49.368 --> 48:51.711
and call yourselves Mustangs!

48:55.457 --> 48:57.726
Are you ready to go out there
and take what's yours?

48:57.759 --> 48:58.970
Yeah!

48:59.003 --> 49:00.446
What you've worked hard for?

49:00.480 --> 49:02.039
Yeah!

49:02.784 --> 49:06.133
Are you ready to accept
the Mustang challenge?

49:10.272 --> 49:11.482
Lead us!

49:11.903 --> 49:13.113
Lead us!

49:44.604 --> 49:48.084
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

50:12.697 --> 50:14.584
Let's go, Mustangs.

50:20.728 --> 50:22.320

Great job, Kelvin.

52:05.895 --> 52:08.664
We bad, we bad, we bad.

Willie, run their asses over.
Run their asses over. It's all you.

52:41.226 --> 52:43.048

Good run. Good run. Right, let's get up.
Walk it off.

53:21.926 --> 53:24.609
Tackled by number 55, John Stevens.

53:24.643 --> 53:26.565
Welcome to my world, boy!

53:36.004 --> 53:39.038

- Pass?

53:39.071 --> 53:41.376
Yeah, man, 97 pass.

53:41.572 --> 53:42.967
Yeah, man, what the hell is wrong with you?

53:43.001 --> 53:45.115
You ain't never thrown a pass
in a real game, have you?

53:45.149 --> 53:47.609
Naw, I played games. I played Madden.

53:47.642 --> 53:49.951
What? This ain't EA, homey.

53:49.985 --> 53:52.669
- A video game?
- I controlled the quarterback. What?

53:52.703 --> 53:53.818
That ain't football.

53:53.851 --> 53:56.255
- Man, come on. 97 what?
- 97 pass.

53:56.289 --> 53:59.998

You can't hit me in my chest, dawg?

55:47.889 --> 55:49.649

55:49.682 --> 55:52.652
- You coulda caught the ball.

55:52.686 --> 55:56.752
Hey! Stop fightin' amongst yourselves.
Take it out on the enemy, for chrissake.

55:56.785 --> 55:57.974
Catch the ball.

55:59.478 --> 56:01.812
Down, set! Hut!

56:08.885 --> 56:11.536
He's open! He's open!

56:23.859 --> 56:25.121
Come on, Mustangs!

56:25.154 --> 56:26.349
Touchdown, Barrington.

56:26.383 --> 56:29.767
That was a 50-yard completion
by number 18, Michael Hays.

56:31.186 --> 56:32.135
Damn, man.

56:32.168 --> 56:34.827
Bates, you supposed to cut
when you see that dude cut, man.

56:34.861 --> 56:36.525
We gettin' worked, man.

56:46.321 --> 56:47.662
And that's halftime

56:47.695 --> 56:51.786
with the Barrington Panthers leading 21
and the Mustangs 0.

56:59.312 --> 57:01.287
Told you guys they wanted
to kick your asses.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.733
That's exactly what they're doin'.

57:02.766 --> 57:05.035
I've seen only two or three hits out there!

57:05.679 --> 57:08.461
Linebackers, defensive backs,
they're runnin' right over you!

57:08.495 --> 57:10.860
You're titty dancin' with 'em!

57:10.893 --> 57:14.089
Defensive line! You're standin' up,
that's why they're takin' your legs out!

57:14.123 --> 57:16.459
Madlock, come here!
You're standin' straight up!

57:16.492 --> 57:19.906
If ya jam on him, you get your hands
on him, use upper body violence,

57:19.940 --> 57:23.080
throw their ass to the dirt
and make the tackle!

57:24.941 --> 57:27.974
And if you get your hands on the ball,
hang on to it.

57:28.621 --> 57:30.312
Don't give it back!

57:34.348 --> 57:35.972
Come on, baby! Let's go!

57:36.006 --> 57:38.247
Let's go, Leon,
let's get 'em back in the game.

57:38.281 --> 57:40.291
Get 'em back in the game, Leon!

57:41.931 --> 57:42.978
Set!

57:43.011 --> 57:44.938
Let's do it! Eyes on the prize!

57:45.931 --> 57:47.524
Black 20!

57:48.043 --> 57:49.668
Black 20!

57:50.987 --> 57:52.513
Hut!

57:56.042 --> 57:57.300
Bates is open!

57:57.334 --> 57:58.559
Throw the ball!

58:07.209 --> 58:09.286
God! I can't believe that.
Right through his hand.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.363
You gotta catch the ball, Kenny!
Catch the ball.

58:11.397 --> 58:13.373
Interception, Barrington.

58:13.407 --> 58:15.651
Barrington's ball on the Mustangs'
32-yard line.

58:15.684 --> 58:19.494
Unbelievable how we're playin'.
Absolutely ridiculous.

58:19.528 --> 58:21.348
Let's go. Lemme see.

58:26.439 --> 58:29.886
Tackle him! Tackle him! Tackle him!
Tackle him!

58:30.534 --> 58:32.061
Damn it!

58:34.406 --> 58:36.991
Another touchdown, Barrington Panthers.

58:37.574 --> 58:39.810
Listen, we may not win this game,
but on the next kickoff,

58:39.844 --> 58:41.567
let's salvage some pride. All right?

58:41.601 --> 58:44.190
Ya get out there,
you run their asses over and don't quit.

58:50.821 --> 58:52.087
Go! Go! Go!

59:02.340 --> 59:03.900
Come on!

59:06.883 --> 59:09.698
Afraid to get hit, boy? Don't like it, do ya?

59:14.626 --> 59:17.560
Willie. Willie. What are you doin'?
You're waitin' for them to hit you.

59:17.594 --> 59:20.154
Put your shoulder down
and run their asses over!

59:20.188 --> 59:22.846
Grow some balls! Get out there and hit 'em!

59:22.879 --> 59:25.504
Willie, shoulder down!
Run their asses over!

59:29.857 --> 59:31.929
Comin' for you, boy.

59:31.962 --> 59:33.560
Black 20!

59:33.594 --> 59:34.519
Hut!

59:44.255 --> 59:46.476
You better stay down, boy.
You better stay down.

59:46.510 --> 59:48.663
- Hey, get off me, bitch!
- Oh, you the bitch.

59:48.697 --> 59:51.450
Willie, get off the field!
Choi, get in there for Weathers.

59:51.484 --> 59:52.532
Dead ball.

59:52.565 --> 59:55.420
Unsportsmanlike conduct on white.
Fifteen yards.

59:55.454 --> 59:57.307
C'mere. What was that?

59:57.341 --> 59:58.420
This ain't no street fight out there.

59:58.453 --> 01:00:01.907
- You gotta have discipline and self-control.
- Tell me about it, Coach.

01:00:43.385 --> 01:00:44.496
That's the final score.

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:48.943
Barrington Panthers 38,
Kilpatrick Mustangs 0.

01:00:51.672 --> 01:00:53.809
Get off the field. Off the field.

01:00:53.843 --> 01:00:57.327
Madlock, what're you doin'?
A six-year-old girl could...

01:01:25.012 --> 01:01:28.460
All right, come on. Bring it in.
Off the bench, come on. C'mere.

01:01:28.493 --> 01:01:31.118
Everybody. Off the benches.
Come take a knee.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.627
Let's gather 'round. Let's go. Take a knee.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.110
C'mon.

01:01:48.243 --> 01:01:50.217
First one is always the toughest.

01:01:51.922 --> 01:01:55.467
We made a lotta mistakes out there today.
All of us.

01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:01.982
Me too.

01:02:02.016 --> 01:02:03.373
No shit.

01:02:07.633 --> 01:02:09.421
They were ready.

01:02:10.128 --> 01:02:12.582
They've been playin' together
for three years.

01:02:12.615 --> 01:02:15.371
We've been together for three weeks.
Lemme tell you somethin' else,

01:02:15.405 --> 01:02:19.051
I still don't believe
that they're 38 points better than you.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.505
I still don't believe
that they're the better team.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:25.444
I would not trade you for them.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:28.364
I want you to hold your heads up high.

01:02:28.398 --> 01:02:31.332
We got nine games left.
We're just gonna have to work harder.

01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:33.478
Shit, not me.

01:02:33.742 --> 01:02:35.302
I don't need this shit.

01:02:45.548 --> 01:02:48.864
I didn't just let 'em down.
I brought 'em down.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.216
- I completely lost it.
- It's a long season, Seany.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:58.506
I don't even know if I'll have enough
kids to field a team next week.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.335
Oh, they'll come back.

01:03:03.603 --> 01:03:08.970
Do you remember how low
you used to get after a big loss?

01:03:09.004 --> 01:03:11.628
You always took everything so personally.

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:15.211
Well, that's 'cause there was someone
on the other end of the dinner table

01:03:15.245 --> 01:03:17.004
tellin' me how much I sucked.

01:03:17.037 --> 01:03:18.961
Mom, that was the worst part about it.

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:23.239
Yesterday, when I was chewin'
those kids out, I sounded just like him.

01:03:31.055 --> 01:03:32.997
Oh, shit, it's the football team.

01:03:38.446 --> 01:03:39.395
Pussies!

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:46.212
All right, shut it down, gentlemen.
Shut it down!

01:03:46.414 --> 01:03:48.105
- Come on, you heard me.
- Mustangs suck!

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.801
Thank you.

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:54.023
I don't know about everybody else,
but me, I ain't playin' no more.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:58.139
Man, Coach Porter say we work hard,
we gonna be winners.

01:03:58.173 --> 01:03:59.994
We worked hard, but we got destroyed.

01:04:00.027 --> 01:04:02.133
He didn't even tell me
when I was supposed to be on the field.

01:04:02.167 --> 01:04:04.441
Then he starts screamin' at me.

01:04:04.893 --> 01:04:06.780
Man, what the hell y'all doin'?

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.383
Sean. Can I see you a minute?

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.074
- Can it wait till after practice?
- No.

01:04:23.661 --> 01:04:25.881
It's better not about stoppin' the program.

01:04:26.082 --> 01:04:27.284
Kids don't want to play anymore.

01:04:27.317 --> 01:04:28.470
Let them tell me that.

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:31.157
Sean, I was hoping that it'd work...

01:04:35.802 --> 01:04:40.408
We wanted to create self-esteem,
but that was just the opposite.

01:04:40.807 --> 01:04:45.198
These kids... They can't handle that kind of
dissapointment.

01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:47.165
I am really sorry.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:08.789
So Donald Lopez.
We need verification from Van Nuys court.

01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:11.919
The document number is 2...

01:05:12.624 --> 01:05:13.430
M- U-S-T

01:05:20.233 --> 01:05:21.017
- A...
- I'll call you back.

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:22.168
...N- G-S.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.667
M- U-S-T-A-N-G-S!

01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:35.231
Mustangs! Mustangs! Mustangs!

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.286
All right, clap it up.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:41.495
Hey, Coach.

01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:46.046
Sean, what's goin' on here?

01:05:47.466 --> 01:05:50.075
I don't know. Whose idea was this?

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:55.254
Like I told you, Coach,
we're tired of bein' losers.

01:06:02.488 --> 01:06:03.132
You still with us?

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:04.625
I'm with the team.

01:06:08.854 --> 01:06:10.856
Yo, Mr. Higa. Catch.

01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:15.714
Yo, Mr. Higa. Hit me.

01:06:19.332 --> 01:06:20.697
- Run a post pattern.
- Paul.

01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:22.696
41-yard gain by number 31, Kelvin Owens.

01:06:36.882 --> 01:06:38.125
All right, Kelvin!

01:06:38.158 --> 01:06:42.349
Bulldogs 21, Mustangs 14.
1... 12 remaining in the fourth quarter.

01:06:42.382 --> 01:06:45.646
It's 21-14. We can maybe win
our first game right here.

01:06:45.679 --> 01:06:47.119
Coach said 23 counter.

01:06:47.152 --> 01:06:49.039
It's all yours, Willie. It's all yours.

01:06:49.073 --> 01:06:51.339
23 counter. On one. On one.

01:06:51.372 --> 01:06:53.131
- Ready?
- Break!

01:06:56.464 --> 01:06:57.964
Set!

01:06:57.998 --> 01:06:59.579
Gray 10!

01:06:59.613 --> 01:07:01.060
Gray 10!

01:07:01.093 --> 01:07:02.508
Hut!

01:07:15.245 --> 01:07:17.187
Go, Willie! Go, Willie!

01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:25.411
Ball!

01:07:28.013 --> 01:07:30.216
You don't like takin' a hit, now, do ya?

01:07:33.356 --> 01:07:34.304
Scared to get hit.

01:07:34.338 --> 01:07:36.833
It's all right. Let's go.
Defense! Let's go, gentlemen!

01:07:36.867 --> 01:07:40.420
Offense, let's go.
Jog it off the field. You'll get it back.

01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:43.464
It's all right, Leon. It's all right. Small gain.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.705
Let's go. Short-term memory.
You gotta let it go.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:59.397
Keep it strong.

01:08:00.713 --> 01:08:02.051
White 10!

01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:03.746
White 10!

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.407
Set! Hut!

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.293
That's the end of the game.

01:08:08.327 --> 01:08:11.904
And the final score,
Bulldogs 21, Mustangs 14.

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:16.285
You're a tough kid, Willie,
but you give up on yourself way too easy.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:21.341
You're a good football player, too.
I think you may even be great.

01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:26.430
And I'm gonna push you until we find out.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.603
We gonna start with the circles to the front.

01:08:36.636 --> 01:08:39.359
'Ey, yo. 'Ey, yo. What the...

01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:45.273
- Man, what's he think he's doin'?
- That fool crazy.

01:08:45.924 --> 01:08:47.680
I've come for Willie Weathers.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.408
What you want with me?

01:08:49.441 --> 01:08:51.776
I'm here to find out just how good you are.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.848
- This a joke?
- Let's go.

01:08:58.243 --> 01:09:00.348
Leon, throw Willie the ball.

01:09:01.986 --> 01:09:03.448
You see this line, Willie?

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:07.098
You knock me past this line,
you'll have my respect.

01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:10.591
What if I don't wanna?

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.631
Then everybody will think
you're a chicken shit.

01:09:12.665 --> 01:09:16.120
"Chicken shit"? That's wrong.

01:09:18.433 --> 01:09:20.341
Let's see what you got, Weathers.

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:25.438
Come on, Weathers, I wanna make it clear.
Run through me. Run over me.

01:09:31.424 --> 01:09:33.398
That's not gonna work, Weathers.
Not like that.

01:09:33.432 --> 01:09:34.452
Get back there and do it again.

01:09:34.486 --> 01:09:36.185
It's all right, Weathers. Pick it up.

01:09:36.384 --> 01:09:39.679
Come on, let's go! Let's go, Weathers!

01:09:42.783 --> 01:09:44.725
Keep your head up and run through me.

01:09:47.678 --> 01:09:51.256
Get up and do it again!
Are you kiddin' me? Get back! Do it again!

01:09:51.288 --> 01:09:54.642
Now, dip your shoulder,
keep your head up and run through me!

01:10:04.252 --> 01:10:07.100
Do it again! We're gonna stay out here
all day if it kills us, Weathers!

01:10:07.133 --> 01:10:09.082
You are gonna put me on my ass!

01:10:09.115 --> 01:10:10.997
Now, keep your head up. Accelerate.

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.946
Put your shoulder down
and run through me!

01:10:19.163 --> 01:10:23.319
What are you lookin' at? Don't look at them.
They ain't gonna help ya out here, Willie.

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.327
Ya got no homeboys, ya got no help!

01:10:25.361 --> 01:10:28.335
Ya damn sure ain't got no gun!
And ya can't run away!

01:10:28.369 --> 01:10:31.638
Ya got nobody but yourself,
but, goddamn it, that's all you need.

01:10:31.672 --> 01:10:34.455
Believe in yourself
and knock me on my ass!

01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:05.773
All right, all right, all right, all right.

01:11:06.902 --> 01:11:08.527
You know you're a idiot, right?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.078
Well, I'm makin' progress.
'Cause I used to be an asshole.

01:11:12.886 --> 01:11:14.446
Come on.

01:11:21.109 --> 01:11:22.800
All right, listen up.

01:11:23.092 --> 01:11:26.605
We've got to run this punt
all the way back. You can do this.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.507
Now get out there, do it together,
work as one and go make it happen!

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.855
Let's go!

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:34.476
Kick return! Let's win it!

01:11:36.403 --> 01:11:39.916
Lions lead by one
with 15 seconds to go in the game.

01:12:14.672 --> 01:12:16.559
Willie, let's go!

01:12:18.831 --> 01:12:20.669
Come on, Willie.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.507
Come on, Willie! Go!

01:13:08.329 --> 01:13:11.645
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby!

01:14:06.436 --> 01:14:08.094
Oh! Y'all messed my arm up!

01:14:08.127 --> 01:14:10.302
Hey! Hey! Come here.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.288
Oh, it's my shoulder, Coach.

01:14:12.675 --> 01:14:13.984
Hold up!

01:14:14.691 --> 01:14:16.349
C'mere, lemme see.

01:14:28.161 --> 01:14:31.510
That's it! That's it! That's it!

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:43.764
'Bout time for practice, isn't it?

01:14:43.798 --> 01:14:46.490
I gotta miss today. Goin' to the hospital.

01:14:46.784 --> 01:14:48.278
How's she doin'?

01:14:48.992 --> 01:14:51.991
Not that good. They don't give her long.

01:14:53.152 --> 01:14:56.348
Sean, if you wanna take some time off,
you know...

01:14:57.471 --> 01:14:58.965
She won't let me.

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:05.623
Hey, shouldn't the team be out there?

01:15:06.974 --> 01:15:07.922
Yeah.

01:15:17.789 --> 01:15:19.315
He's on his way.

01:15:27.548 --> 01:15:29.752
How come you guys aren't out there?

01:15:34.619 --> 01:15:36.408
It's for your mom, Coach.

01:15:43.546 --> 01:15:45.073
We all signed the card.

01:15:45.882 --> 01:15:48.086
Yeah, tell her she needs to get better
so she can come see us, Coach.

01:15:48.119 --> 01:15:49.877
That's right, man.

01:15:50.553 --> 01:15:52.113
For real.

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:55.893
Thanks.

01:15:57.401 --> 01:15:59.343
You guys get out there and practice.

01:16:00.345 --> 01:16:01.938
Hey, Coach.

01:16:02.456 --> 01:16:05.009
My next touchdown's
gonna be for your mom.

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:11.892
All right, y'all, bring it in. Come on.
One, two, three.

01:16:11.926 --> 01:16:13.585
Porter!

01:16:24.822 --> 01:16:26.512
I see

01:16:28.853 --> 01:16:30.380
Kenny.

01:16:31.861 --> 01:16:35.538
- And where's Willie?
- Right here.

01:16:36.532 --> 01:16:41.104
- They're some good boys.
- Yeah. They are.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:47.114
Ya know, what's crazy, Mom,
is next year I'll have a whole new group.

01:16:47.795 --> 01:16:49.900
That's a long way away.

01:16:53.587 --> 01:16:56.620
I'm so proud of you.

01:16:57.394 --> 01:17:01.998
- Your father would be proud of you too.
- Mom.

01:17:02.578 --> 01:17:05.295
He tried, Sean.

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:08.206
He tried.

01:17:08.785 --> 01:17:11.054
You're so darn stubborn.

01:17:12.977 --> 01:17:14.285
I know.

01:17:14.319 --> 01:17:17.418
Guess if it wasn't for bein' stubborn,

01:17:18.736 --> 01:17:21.486
there wouldn't be no football team.

01:17:23.663 --> 01:17:26.598
You know my greatest accomplishment?

01:17:27.696 --> 01:17:32.485
I raised a good man.

01:17:37.966 --> 01:17:40.649
A couple hours later, she was gone.

01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:45.256
That game today was just like a dream.

01:17:48.718 --> 01:17:51.401
I stood on those sidelines thinkin' about her

01:17:52.429 --> 01:17:55.146
and all the games she watched me play.

01:17:56.237 --> 01:18:01.026
All the times she bandaged my cuts,
got me ice packs.

01:18:01.868 --> 01:18:03.624
She washed my stuff.

01:18:09.611 --> 01:18:11.367
She cheered me on.

01:18:12.715 --> 01:18:14.603
She cheered me up.

01:18:21.354 --> 01:18:26.307
I just felt so bad for all those kids
who never knew that type of mother.

01:18:31.529 --> 01:18:33.351
What about your dad?

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.900
I don't talk about him.

01:18:41.544 --> 01:18:43.683
I'm glad to hear that things
are getting better, Mom.

01:18:43.716 --> 01:18:47.329
Maybe when I get out
we can live together again.

01:18:47.363 --> 01:18:51.011
Football is great. And I'm good at it now.

01:18:53.735 --> 01:18:55.840
I love sackin' the quarterback.

01:18:57.638 --> 01:19:00.769
Sometimes I can't even believe it's legal.

01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:07.556
Throwin TD's don't pay as much
as slingin' rocks,

01:19:08.645 --> 01:19:10.433
but damn, it feel good.

01:19:12.677 --> 01:19:16.768
Grandma, you'd be proud of me.
I'm stayin' outta trouble.

01:19:19.045 --> 01:19:21.216
I don't have enemies here anymore.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.433
We done won seven in a row now.

01:19:26.467 --> 01:19:29.498
I can't remember the exact number
of touchdowns I scored.

01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:35.998
I think about 60.

01:19:37.346 --> 01:19:41.306
Dear Danyelle,
I wish you would write back to me.

01:19:42.274 --> 01:19:44.379
I'm different than I was.

01:19:45.922 --> 01:19:49.369
I think you would like me again
if you saw me play football.

01:20:08.383 --> 01:20:09.660
How ya doin'?

01:20:10.015 --> 01:20:12.797
Doin' great, sir. How can I help you?

01:20:13.023 --> 01:20:15.989
- I've got a letter for a Danyelle Rollins.
- Well, who from?

01:20:16.766 --> 01:20:18.259
Willie Weathers.

01:20:18.293 --> 01:20:21.140
- And who are you?
- His football coach.

01:20:21.174 --> 01:20:23.954
- Isn't that kid in jail?
- Yeah, he is.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:27.193
We've got a team now.
And Willie's a hell of a player.

01:20:27.933 --> 01:20:30.104
He's also a hell of a young man.

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:33.649
I just don't understand how you could
read his letters and not write him back.

01:20:34.588 --> 01:20:36.278
I never got any letters.

01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:39.129
Look, mister, my baby's going to college.
She's gettin' outta this place.

01:20:39.162 --> 01:20:40.723
Daddy, you kept his letters from me?

01:20:40.756 --> 01:20:42.867
And if she's going to fulfill her potential,

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.622
there's no room in her life
for some gang member.

01:20:45.655 --> 01:20:48.147
- Ya understand that?
- Absolutely.

01:20:48.572 --> 01:20:50.513
That's not who Willie is anymore.

01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:53.527
With a little bit of support,
maybe he'll stay that way.

01:20:53.561 --> 01:20:55.186
I'm glad to hear it.

01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.225
But I'm not willing to bet
my daughter's future on it.

01:20:58.259 --> 01:21:00.980
I understand. Thank you.

01:21:11.097 --> 01:21:13.518
Thank you. Enjoy your visit.

01:21:21.015 --> 01:21:24.845
- Who ya here for?
- Willie Weathers. I'm his brother.

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:33.265
- You're awful big for a six-year-old.
- Say what?

01:21:33.299 --> 01:21:36.778
Says here Willie has one brother,
six years old.

01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:40.464
- That's wrong, 'cause I'm here, ain't I?
- Yeah. Yes, you are.

01:21:40.917 --> 01:21:43.186
But you ain't gettin' in.

01:21:44.342 --> 01:21:46.065
Come on, man, I'm all he's got.

01:21:46.262 --> 01:21:49.490
Sorry. Now, you have a nice day.

01:22:13.778 --> 01:22:14.857
Bitch.

01:22:14.891 --> 01:22:17.002
I'll catch you on the rebound, homey!

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:24.077
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
a new addition to the Mustang team...

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.828
Mustang Cheerleaders
from Camp Scott, California.

01:22:26.861 --> 01:22:29.199
Camp Scott, that's that girls' prison.

01:22:34.161 --> 01:22:36.844
That's my girl Cherise! She's so hot, man.

01:22:36.877 --> 01:22:38.537
Who? The one on the end there?

01:22:38.571 --> 01:22:40.233
Go Mustangs!

01:22:40.266 --> 01:22:43.369
Nah. Come on, now, the one in the middle.

01:22:43.663 --> 01:22:45.419
Hot like the summer.

01:22:48.559 --> 01:22:50.447
The one in the middle!

01:22:50.927 --> 01:22:53.196
Hey, hey! All right, eyes front!

01:22:58.894 --> 01:23:02.155
Hey, turn around! Turn around!

01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:06.627
And at the end of the two-minute warning,
the Mustangs lead 17-14.

01:23:08.685 --> 01:23:10.724
Drac! Yo, Drac!

01:23:11.148 --> 01:23:12.805
Do your thing, boy! Drac!

01:23:12.839 --> 01:23:14.818
- Show these niggas what you can do!
- What up, baby!

01:23:14.852 --> 01:23:18.503
Willie! Get goin'. Let's go! Focus!

01:23:20.364 --> 01:23:22.665
Green 18. Hut!

01:23:32.682 --> 01:23:34.405
Yeah, baby!

01:23:41.034 --> 01:23:44.230
Touchdown, number 13,
Willie Weathers for the Mustangs.

01:23:44.263 --> 01:23:45.408
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:47.487
- 88, baby!
- I'm gonna represent, baby!

01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:48.805
Hut!

01:23:49.513 --> 01:23:52.611
And that's the game,
Mustangs 21, Eagles 7.

01:23:52.645 --> 01:23:56.258
Mustangs! We're goin' to the playoffs!

01:24:00.967 --> 01:24:01.981
Good game.

01:24:02.014 --> 01:24:03.614
Good game, good game.
Y'all did y'all thing.

01:24:03.648 --> 01:24:05.345
Good job, good job. Wassup?

01:24:05.378 --> 01:24:08.349
- Congratulate on the 88.
- 8-8!

01:24:09.159 --> 01:24:10.947
88 for life, homey.

01:24:16.934 --> 01:24:18.460
What up, 95?

01:24:18.982 --> 01:24:20.258
- Get up off of me, bitch!
- What up?

01:24:20.292 --> 01:24:21.372
You be payin' for that, nigga!

01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:24.292
- You a bluff! You ain't got nothin', fool!
- Don't let me catch you in the street.

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.812
I be like this! I know that! Take that, nigga!

01:24:26.845 --> 01:24:28.608
Kelvin!

01:24:30.724 --> 01:24:33.091
Go to sleep. Go to sleep!

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:37.789
Free!

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:14.589
- Any news?
- No, he's still in surgery.

01:25:16.287 --> 01:25:17.236
Sean,

01:25:18.623 --> 01:25:21.340
they're makin' us forfeit the playoff game.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.832
Season's over.

01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:31.227
I told those kids

01:25:32.062 --> 01:25:35.193
that no matter what happened,
they'd be winners.

01:25:36.062 --> 01:25:38.298
Hey, man, you did your best.

01:25:39.614 --> 01:25:41.883
We all did our best, I guess.

01:25:47.453 --> 01:25:51.511
- What do we tell 'em now?
- That's what I don't know.

01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:07.093
All right, gentlemen, line it up.

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:11.727
Come on, move! We've done this before.
Let's go!

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:15.535
A line here. A line here. A line here.

01:26:15.568 --> 01:26:19.471
I heard about you. You buster!
Got your boy Free killed.

01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:21.845
- I'll kill you!
- Get off me!

01:26:21.878 --> 01:26:23.507
I'll kill all you bitches!

01:26:23.834 --> 01:26:26.037
- I'm 88! 88 for life!
- It's Willie. Come on, man!

01:26:26.233 --> 01:26:29.679
Did you hear me! 88 for life, bitch!

01:26:29.713 --> 01:26:33.876
- He goin' crazy!
- I'm a 88! 88! 88, man!

01:26:33.909 --> 01:26:35.186
Get 'im off me!

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.427
Screw this bitch-ass football team!

01:26:38.072 --> 01:26:41.105
- You're goin' to the box, Willie.
- I don't give a shit!

01:26:41.139 --> 01:26:42.156
Get 'im outta here!

01:26:42.190 --> 01:26:45.230
And I don't need this football team shit!

01:27:01.237 --> 01:27:04.881
I just got back from the hospital.
Kelvin's gonna be okay.

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:07.688
Better for me if the nigga was dead.

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:10.895
Ya think so? I really don't think it matters

01:27:12.212 --> 01:27:16.009
'cause you're screwed either way, Willie.
Your homeys know what you did yesterday.

01:27:16.275 --> 01:27:19.275
So you go back to the hood,
they're gonna put a bullet in your head,

01:27:19.308 --> 01:27:21.322
'cause they think you're not down
for the set anymore.

01:27:21.356 --> 01:27:22.988
No matter what you say now.

01:27:24.883 --> 01:27:27.730
You know what? I think they're right.

01:27:28.019 --> 01:27:29.262
Man!

01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:34.028
You better be good to me, asshole,
'cause I'm all you got!

01:27:35.314 --> 01:27:37.681
- Man, fuck you!
- Who else cares about you?

01:27:37.714 --> 01:27:39.174
I don't need nobody else!

01:27:39.207 --> 01:27:40.939
You don't give a shit about me
or anybody else!

01:27:40.973 --> 01:27:41.958
Man, that's right!

01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:44.204
Then why'd you try
and save Kelvin yesterday?

01:27:44.237 --> 01:27:46.345
Huh? Answer me that!

01:27:47.569 --> 01:27:50.782
Why'd you side with the enemy
over your own homeboy!

01:27:50.815 --> 01:27:53.995
Man, 'cause-a you!
And this damn football team, man!

01:27:54.029 --> 01:27:56.912
That's bullshit! You made a choice!

01:27:56.945 --> 01:27:58.349
No, I didn't!

01:27:58.383 --> 01:28:03.052
I ain't even know what was happenin' to me!
It was just so...

01:28:03.085 --> 01:28:04.907
Everything so quick!

01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:14.568
I don't know what's happenin' to me, man.

01:28:24.013 --> 01:28:25.322
I do.

01:28:28.013 --> 01:28:30.915
You're not the loser you were
when you first got here, Willie.

01:28:32.812 --> 01:28:35.049
You're just not used to bein' a winner.

01:28:37.996 --> 01:28:40.745
My father said I was a waste of his time

01:28:41.035 --> 01:28:42.464
and his money.

01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:46.023
Your father was a loser, Willie.

01:28:48.074 --> 01:28:50.343
My old man was the same way.

01:28:50.762 --> 01:28:53.828
He spent so much time tellin' me
I was no good, tellin' me I was nothin',

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:55.141
I believed him.

01:28:55.561 --> 01:28:57.983
That why you so pissed off all the time?

01:29:01.961 --> 01:29:05.441
Yeah, that's probably got
somethin' to do with it.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:11.968
I know how you feel, Willie.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.735
You get to the point where you expect
to screw up. You expect to fail.

01:29:19.815 --> 01:29:22.149
If we wanna win, we gotta let 'em go.

01:29:24.423 --> 01:29:25.949
Forgive 'em and move on.

01:29:27.398 --> 01:29:29.667
- Forgive 'em?
- Forgive 'em.

01:29:31.814 --> 01:29:34.465
Otherwise we give 'em
too much power over us.

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:36.608
And they don't deserve it.

01:29:37.861 --> 01:29:40.796
Well, how long it take you
to forgive your dad?

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:06.557
Till just now.

01:30:12.706 --> 01:30:14.134
Till just now.

01:30:20.513 --> 01:30:22.618
Kelvin's gonna be okay?

01:30:24.416 --> 01:30:25.790
Yeah.

01:30:28.928 --> 01:30:31.862
Whole football team's done, though, huh?

01:30:37.311 --> 01:30:38.871
Maybe not.

01:30:42.335 --> 01:30:45.432
After our game, Willie Weathers
tried to save Kelvin Owens

01:30:45.466 --> 01:30:48.022
'cause he didn't see him as an enemy,
he saw him as a teammate.

01:30:48.734 --> 01:30:51.101
Everybody wants to talk about us
winning eight games in a row

01:30:51.134 --> 01:30:52.114
and how great that is.

01:30:52.148 --> 01:30:56.018
That's nothing compared to breaking
the power that gangs have over these kids.

01:30:59.485 --> 01:31:03.608
If you cancel this game,
we're givin' that power back to them.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:07.539
I admire what you're tryin' to do,
Coach, I really do.

01:31:07.573 --> 01:31:11.954
But how can I ask our parents to expose
their kids to potential violence?

01:31:12.476 --> 01:31:16.337
Yeah, you see, our problem is,
while you didn't cause the shooting

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:18.578
you couldn't prevent it either.

01:31:20.635 --> 01:31:22.358
What if we could?

01:31:26.299 --> 01:31:29.266
What if we could guarantee
it won't happen again?

01:31:39.833 --> 01:31:42.188
Well, what you see behind us here
is a force of volunteers

01:31:42.222 --> 01:31:45.613
from the Department of Probation,
the LAPD and the Sheriff's Department.

01:31:45.646 --> 01:31:48.143
The County Board of Supervisors
firmly believes

01:31:48.176 --> 01:31:52.525
we can't allow gangs to dictate
the terms by which our young people live.

01:31:52.856 --> 01:31:54.467
M- U-S-T-A-N-G!

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:05.357
Well, I know they had
their uniforms donated,

01:32:05.391 --> 01:32:08.496
but where did they get those moves?

01:32:09.654 --> 01:32:13.002
They're Mustangs, Coach.
They accepted the challenge.

01:32:25.076 --> 01:32:29.680
Relax, guys. What're you worried about?
That they beat ya 30-nothin' last time?

01:32:29.714 --> 01:32:31.438
38 to nothin'.

01:32:31.471 --> 01:32:34.987
They didn't beat you.
They beat a team that never played before.

01:32:35.021 --> 01:32:37.033
But on this day it's gonna be different.

01:32:37.067 --> 01:32:39.015
On this day,
you're gonna have Mustang pride.

01:32:39.048 --> 01:32:41.261
You're gonna go out there,
you're gonna put your helmets on,

01:32:41.295 --> 01:32:44.112
buckle your chinstrap,
and hand out 38 ass-whoopin's!

01:32:44.146 --> 01:32:46.829
You understand? Mustang pride!

01:32:46.862 --> 01:32:48.491
Let's go, Mustangs!

01:32:56.817 --> 01:32:58.443
Hi, Dad!

01:33:01.073 --> 01:33:02.829
Go Mustangs!

01:33:05.744 --> 01:33:09.191
- Kenny!
- Mom!

01:33:09.225 --> 01:33:10.757
I made it!

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:16.198
Willie! Willie!

01:34:19.209 --> 01:34:22.175
Captains, let's go out for the coin toss.

01:34:22.208 --> 01:34:26.786
That's a psych-job.
Sending out eight guys to a damn coin toss.

01:34:28.584 --> 01:34:30.340
Psych 'em right back.

01:35:09.348 --> 01:35:11.170
Let's go, Willie!

01:35:40.736 --> 01:35:42.132
- Little flag.
- We've got a clipped ball

01:35:42.165 --> 01:35:44.679
- on the receiving team.
- Flag on the play. No touchdown.

01:35:44.713 --> 01:35:47.195
- You gotta be kidding me!
- Clipping on the receiving team!

01:35:47.228 --> 01:35:48.212
That was a fair hit!

01:35:48.246 --> 01:35:50.588
Clipping on number 88, Kenny Bates.

01:35:53.504 --> 01:35:56.470
Bates! Bates! C'mere!

01:35:56.503 --> 01:35:58.746
Don't worry about it, we'll get it back,
all right? You hear me?

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.986
Take it easy on the ref,
he knows he made a horrible call.

01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.265
That's okay.

01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:06.546
- Offense, let's go!
- Kenny, it's okay!

01:36:07.326 --> 01:36:08.635
Come on, Mustangs!

01:36:11.998 --> 01:36:13.885
Goin' right.

01:36:13.919 --> 01:36:15.127
Set!

01:36:16.093 --> 01:36:17.270
Gray ten!

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:18.933
- Goin' right.
- Gray ten!

01:36:18.966 --> 01:36:20.249
Hut!

01:36:28.092 --> 01:36:31.321
You remember me?
I'm gonna be in your face all day, loser!

01:36:33.627 --> 01:36:34.903
Hut!

01:36:58.201 --> 01:36:59.695
Touchdown Barrington.

01:37:05.976 --> 01:37:08.342
Great effort.
All right, come on, offense, let's go!

01:37:08.376 --> 01:37:11.277
Run 18! Run 18!

01:37:11.512 --> 01:37:12.592
Hut!

01:37:16.407 --> 01:37:19.789
Come on, Leon! You got Willie open!
Throw it!

01:37:23.574 --> 01:37:25.036
Throw it!

01:37:31.766 --> 01:37:33.326
Damn it!

01:37:33.717 --> 01:37:37.994
Barrington recovers the ball
on the Mustangs' 40-yard line.

01:37:38.612 --> 01:37:40.302
Leon's intimidated.

01:37:40.336 --> 01:37:42.990
He's too worried about throwin'
another interception.

01:37:43.316 --> 01:37:44.231
Yeah.

01:37:44.264 --> 01:37:46.479
First down, Barrington Panthers.

01:37:46.964 --> 01:37:49.003
Come on, defense, let's go! Get out there!

01:37:49.036 --> 01:37:52.422
Leon! C'mere. Look at me.
You're a great quarterback.

01:37:52.456 --> 01:37:55.401
Believe in your teammates
and believe in yourself. You understand?

01:37:55.667 --> 01:37:57.969
Let me see you smile. Come on.

01:37:58.643 --> 01:38:00.072
Attaboy.

01:38:04.338 --> 01:38:07.153
Blue 15! Hut!

01:38:11.697 --> 01:38:13.420
Perez!

01:38:21.712 --> 01:38:24.101
Come on, man!

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:31.624
Touchdown, Barrington.
Number 3, David Smith.

01:38:35.087 --> 01:38:36.875
I smoked that!

01:38:42.254 --> 01:38:43.747
Halftime!

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:47.269
We got a whole half to play.
We got a whole half of football left.

01:38:47.303 --> 01:38:48.802
Come on, guys.

01:38:48.836 --> 01:38:50.153
Hold your head up, come on!

01:39:28.458 --> 01:39:31.523
Sean, you gotta get 'em ready
for the second half.

01:39:32.873 --> 01:39:34.597
- They're ready.
- What?

01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:36.191
Just wait.

01:39:37.065 --> 01:39:38.472
They're ready.

01:39:44.456 --> 01:39:46.146
Man, those fools are whippin' our ass.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.644
For real, man.

01:39:47.678 --> 01:39:49.029
Shit.

01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:52.547
They ain't that good, man.

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:56.733
We're better.

01:39:57.990 --> 01:40:01.405
And it means much more to us. You know?

01:40:04.646 --> 01:40:07.101
When this all started, man,

01:40:08.101 --> 01:40:10.784
Coach, he said we'd be winners.

01:40:14.725 --> 01:40:17.146
I thought he was full of shit, man.

01:40:19.332 --> 01:40:21.536
I hated y'all.

01:40:21.956 --> 01:40:23.744
Didn't want no part of it.

01:40:27.684 --> 01:40:29.472
But then

01:40:30.275 --> 01:40:32.063
we made a team.

01:40:33.731 --> 01:40:36.349
We showed people somethin'.

01:40:39.138 --> 01:40:40.764
Coach is right.

01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:43.488
We changed.

01:40:45.729 --> 01:40:47.736
We're not losers no more.

01:40:49.185 --> 01:40:54.040
All we gotta do is go out there
and show it one more time.

01:40:58.112 --> 01:40:59.999
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:41:42.012 --> 01:41:45.175
Let's get out there and kick some ass!

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:56.369
- Break!
- Let's go!

01:41:56.402 --> 01:42:00.249
In the third quarter the score
remains Barrington Panthers 14,

01:42:00.282 --> 01:42:01.361
Kilpatrick Mustangs 0.

01:42:01.395 --> 01:42:03.190
Let's go!

01:42:12.921 --> 01:42:14.547
Boom!

01:42:14.777 --> 01:42:16.784
That's what I'm talkin' about! Let's go!

01:42:47.957 --> 01:42:49.233
Man.

01:42:49.266 --> 01:42:52.115
Damn! Damn, that white boy be killin' us!

01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:54.220
Woo! I'm back, nigger!

01:42:54.741 --> 01:42:56.114
Stevens, come on, man.

01:42:56.147 --> 01:42:58.220
Don't go nowhere, dawg, I'll be right back.

01:42:58.612 --> 01:43:00.400
Huddle up.

01:43:01.236 --> 01:43:04.464
Let's get back in the game, baby. On one.

01:43:05.044 --> 01:43:08.160
- Let's make it a 625 swing.
- Coach called a flood.

01:43:08.194 --> 01:43:11.278
You can call a audible
if you see an opening, right?

01:43:12.403 --> 01:43:14.158
Look, I got an opening.

01:43:16.306 --> 01:43:18.062
- Ready?
- Break!

01:43:22.770 --> 01:43:25.191
That's not the right formation.
What the hell are they doin'?

01:43:25.225 --> 01:43:27.082
Leon! Leon, what're you doin'?

01:43:27.116 --> 01:43:28.940
Get in the right formation!

01:43:33.616 --> 01:43:34.575
Set!

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.321
Black 20!

01:43:37.616 --> 01:43:39.023
Black 20!

01:43:39.056 --> 01:43:40.364
Hut!

01:43:53.711 --> 01:43:57.158
Go, Willie, go! Go, Weathers, go!

01:44:16.268 --> 01:44:18.177
Yeah, baby!

01:44:24.172 --> 01:44:28.263
That was number 13, Willie Weathers.
Touchdown for the Mustangs.

01:44:29.355 --> 01:44:31.928
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:44:31.961 --> 01:44:34.502
Woo! You all right, nigga?

01:44:40.778 --> 01:44:42.883
Great job! Great job!

01:44:52.424 --> 01:44:55.141
Fourth quarter, Barrington's ball
on the Mustang's two-yard line

01:44:55.174 --> 01:44:57.182
and we have one minute of play remaining.

01:44:57.216 --> 01:44:59.077
You stop 'em now, we got a chance.

01:44:59.111 --> 01:45:01.543
Unless they score again,
then it'll be all over, man.

01:45:01.576 --> 01:45:03.234
Man, shut up, Bug!

01:45:03.268 --> 01:45:04.893
Shut the hell up, Bug.

01:45:09.479 --> 01:45:11.813
Left! He's throwin' left!

01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:14.431
Blue 16! Hut!

01:45:27.333 --> 01:45:28.859
Ball! Ball!

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:37.529
All right! Go offense!

01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:45.113
Fumble recovery, number 5, Miguel Perez.

01:45:45.147 --> 01:45:47.936
The Mustangs have possession
with the score 14 to 10

01:45:48.419 --> 01:45:49.913
and 50 seconds remaining.

01:45:53.602 --> 01:45:56.271
Coach, I'm goin' deep.

01:45:56.304 --> 01:45:58.907
- Ya think?
- Yes.

01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:02.271
Leon. Bates.
Feel like catchin' a ball, Bates?

01:46:03.105 --> 01:46:05.022
Coach, the deep pass always goes to Perez.

01:46:05.056 --> 01:46:06.906
Everybody knows that,
including Barrington.

01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:09.561
- Coach, I don't wanna...
- Hey, it's only a game, Kenny.

01:46:09.594 --> 01:46:13.047
You just get out there
and give it your best shot. Catch the ball.

01:46:13.081 --> 01:46:14.680
Let's go. Get out there. Come on.

01:46:14.714 --> 01:46:16.378
Let's go, Hayes.

01:46:21.151 --> 01:46:22.777
We got the ball back, let's go!

01:46:23.423 --> 01:46:24.916
- What's up, man?
- Help me out with somethin'.

01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:27.740
All right, man, come on, let's ride.
Watch out, y'all.

01:46:28.031 --> 01:46:30.486
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
you can do it.

01:46:44.349 --> 01:46:45.909
Set!

01:46:47.197 --> 01:46:49.204
Green 18!

01:46:51.901 --> 01:46:54.748
Green 18! Hut!

01:46:57.884 --> 01:46:59.477
You're mine, boy!

01:47:29.945 --> 01:47:32.334
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:48:04.469 --> 01:48:07.021
That was a Mustang gain of 50 yards.

01:48:07.054 --> 01:48:09.678
The first reception by number 88,
Kenny Bates.

01:48:10.549 --> 01:48:12.304
Come in.

01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:15.786
Bring it in! Come on.

01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:18.891
With the ball on the 20-yard line,
the score is 14-10.

01:48:19.475 --> 01:48:23.337
Come here. All right.
We got time for one play.

01:48:24.371 --> 01:48:26.846
26 toss to Willie. Can you get the 20 yards?

01:48:26.879 --> 01:48:29.322
- Come on, Willie.
- All right, it's cool.

01:48:30.578 --> 01:48:33.873
- Definitely.
- Exactly. You believe. We believe in you.

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:35.978
Get in the end zone. Come on. Go. Go.

01:48:36.011 --> 01:48:37.740
Let's go!

01:48:45.233 --> 01:48:47.055
Touchdown! Let's go!

01:48:47.856 --> 01:48:52.558
A'ight, team, this is it.
We goin' with the l-right, 26 toss.

01:48:55.376 --> 01:48:58.343
- Hey, who's 36? Who's 36? There's no...
- Who the hell is that?

01:48:58.377 --> 01:48:59.975
That's Junior!

01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:05.350
Look, it's your daddy!

01:49:07.087 --> 01:49:08.482
- Yo, Junior.
- Shit.

01:49:08.516 --> 01:49:11.448
- Move out.
- Junior, what the hell?

01:49:11.482 --> 01:49:14.382
Slipped disc, my ass. Get behind me.

01:49:15.374 --> 01:49:16.836
Let's do this together.

01:49:17.486 --> 01:49:19.722
A'ight, y'all, we gotta go. We gotta go!

01:49:20.366 --> 01:49:25.067
This is it, right here.
L- right, 26 toss. On one. On one.

01:49:25.101 --> 01:49:26.824
- Ready?
- Break!

01:50:19.336 --> 01:50:21.375
Green 18!

01:50:37.926 --> 01:50:39.071
Go! Go!

01:50:44.452 --> 01:50:47.452
Not this time! I'm gonna kill ya, boy!

01:50:47.486 --> 01:50:50.242
No, you ain't! No, you ain't!

01:50:50.275 --> 01:50:52.064
No, you ain't!

01:51:23.713 --> 01:51:26.876
Touchdown, number 13, Willie Weathers.

01:51:32.384 --> 01:51:33.758
You're the best!

01:51:46.206 --> 01:51:48.573
Hey. C'mere!

01:51:56.157 --> 01:51:58.361
Mustangs, baby!

01:52:09.884 --> 01:52:13.415
We played the championship game
the next week.

01:52:13.448 --> 01:52:16.945
We lost 17-14.
But we played a helluva game.

01:52:17.596 --> 01:52:19.384
And no one called us losers.

01:52:20.347 --> 01:52:23.543
I told 'em, far as I was concerned,
they were champs.

01:52:24.379 --> 01:52:26.419
Since then all the kids have been released.

01:52:27.195 --> 01:52:30.871
24 are goin' to school.
Three are working full-time jobs.

01:52:31.610 --> 01:52:33.550
And only five are back in jail.

01:52:33.584 --> 01:52:37.236
That's a lot better than the average
failure rate of 75 percent.

01:52:38.297 --> 01:52:42.072
After his release, Junior Palaita
got a job working for a furniture company

01:52:42.105 --> 01:52:44.045
and lives with his family.

01:52:44.079 --> 01:52:46.402
Kelvin Owens recovered
from his bullet wound.

01:52:46.436 --> 01:52:48.726
He's gonna play
for Washington High next season.

01:52:49.081 --> 01:52:52.375
Miguel Perez and Donald Madlock
went back to their old gangs

01:52:52.409 --> 01:52:54.960
and are now in California
Youth Authority prisons.

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.436
Kenny Bates is goin' to school
in Redondo Beach and living with his mom.

01:53:00.471 --> 01:53:03.504
Leon Hayes is trying to resist
the crack dealer's lifestyle.

01:53:03.703 --> 01:53:06.091
He's gonna play football for Dorsey High
this year.

01:53:06.774 --> 01:53:10.451
Bug Wendal was killed in a drive-by
shooting in Compton.

01:53:11.542 --> 01:53:15.371
Willie Weathers got a full scholarship
to play football for a top boarding school.

01:53:16.054 --> 01:53:18.420
A school that's a long way from 88th Street.

01:53:20.533 --> 01:53:22.573
And how'd things change for me?

01:53:25.397 --> 01:53:26.803
Not a whole lot.

01:53:27.764 --> 01:53:31.987
On the gridiron we do it my way.
Not your way, my way.

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.767
Right now you're all losers.

01:53:34.801 --> 01:53:38.183
That's why you're in here. 'Cause ya lost.

01:53:39.187 --> 01:53:43.660
But if you accept this challenge,
if you accept the Mustang challenge,

01:53:43.693 --> 01:53:46.992
then come this December,
when it's all over with,

01:53:47.026 --> 01:53:49.000
I promise you

01:53:50.194 --> 01:53:51.754
you'll be winners.

01:53:52.082 --> 01:53:53.511
Ready?

01:53:54.802 --> 01:53:55.722
M- U-S...

01:53:58.737 --> 01:53:59.217
A!

01:54:00.305 --> 01:54:01.226
A- N-G-S!

01:54:04.368 --> 01:54:05.578
Mustangs!

01:54:07.984 --> 01:54:12.653
You don't know how to spell "Mustangs"?
You have got to be shitting me!

01:54:18.159 --> 01:54:19.335
All right.

01:54:19.369 --> 01:54:21.032
Here we go again.

01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:23.961
M- U-S-T-A-N-G.

01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:35.658
Tell me to shoot somebody, I'll shoot 'em.

01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:39.204
They would have killed me
if I wouldn't-a killed them first.

01:54:39.237 --> 01:54:42.504
I played football in high school
and college and most of my life.

01:54:42.538 --> 01:54:45.801
You know, I had people work with me as
a kid and they made a difference in my life,

01:54:45.835 --> 01:54:48.235
and I was just hopin'
to pass that on to somebody else.

01:54:49.068 --> 01:54:51.523
The Kilpatrick sports program
is three-pronged.

01:54:52.652 --> 01:54:54.309
The dorm, where you're at now.

01:54:54.343 --> 01:54:56.833
You've gotta learn to get along
with people from different neighborhoods,

01:54:56.866 --> 01:54:59.328
different backgrounds. And school.

01:54:59.362 --> 01:55:03.012
Apply yourself, learn,
become a better student.

01:55:03.434 --> 01:55:07.493
On the field, you do it my way.
Not your way.

01:55:07.526 --> 01:55:09.122
Your way got you here.

01:55:09.155 --> 01:55:13.732
You played a game, sellin' drugs,
robbin' people, rippin' people off,

01:55:13.766 --> 01:55:16.354
and you lost. Right now you're a loser.

01:55:17.449 --> 01:55:19.062
Mustangs are winners.

01:55:19.096 --> 01:55:20.676
Why'd you take 'em off?

01:55:20.710 --> 01:55:21.759
Good job, man.

01:55:21.792 --> 01:55:23.870
- Where you goin'?
- I'm goin' to put my shorts on.

01:55:23.904 --> 01:55:27.522
Why'd you even come out with 'em off?
Why'd you even walk off the field?

01:55:27.556 --> 01:55:29.663
You quitting again?
You know your program.

01:55:29.697 --> 01:55:32.418
Your program is you run, you get in shape,
and you get a uniform.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:36.455
You just keep walkin'. Football team's here.
You wanna be part of it, we're here.

01:55:36.488 --> 01:55:38.493
But you bring a heart with you next time.

01:55:40.999 --> 01:55:42.013
I'm tired of bein' a loser.

01:55:42.046 --> 01:55:47.236
Out there on the field,
I can just show 'em that I'm somebody.

01:55:47.590 --> 01:55:49.793
Show 'em that I can play.

01:55:50.213 --> 01:55:54.653
This program has helped me get
a relationship back with my mom.

01:55:55.173 --> 01:55:57.377
I want her to hold me

01:56:00.645 --> 01:56:02.849
and tell me she loves me.

01:56:05.284 --> 01:56:07.389
It's up to you to accept the challenge.

01:56:07.423 --> 01:56:10.557
If anyone tells you it's gonna be easy,
they're lyin' to you.

01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:13.475
I'm gonna push you.
I'm gonna challenge you.

01:56:15.939 --> 01:56:18.492
Put your helmets on
and go shake their hands.

01:56:25.186 --> 01:56:28.863
But I still don't believe
that they're 26 points better than you.

01:56:29.730 --> 01:56:33.690
I still think you're the better team.
I still would not trade you for them.

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:38.048
These kids, the anxiety's
weighing them down, it's holdin' 'em back.

01:56:38.082 --> 01:56:39.802
It's almost a fear of the unknown.

01:56:39.836 --> 01:56:42.010
It's gonna be a whole new
experience for 'em.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.010
We wanted to thank you
for not giving up on us,

01:56:46.043 --> 01:56:50.040
even though we didn't want
to put out the effort at times.

01:56:50.074 --> 01:56:52.086
Thank you for teaching us
more than football.

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.980
You taught us about the game of life.

01:56:54.014 --> 01:56:56.664
This ball, I wanna give it to our head coach,

01:56:56.698 --> 01:56:58.110
Sean Porter.

01:57:08.638 --> 01:57:10.612
When they came in here
a lot of people thought of them

01:57:10.646 --> 01:57:12.344
as criminals and delinquents.

01:57:14.173 --> 01:57:15.547
No way.

01:57:23.132 --> 01:57:24.342
You did a great job.

01:57:24.376 --> 01:57:26.713
You're a helluva group of young men.

01:57:30.332 --> 01:57:32.055
You guys are champs.
