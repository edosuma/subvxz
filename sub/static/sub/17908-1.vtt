00:54.972 --> 00:59.267
We reap what we sow.
That's what the Bible says.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.811
Payback's a motherfucker.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.105
I think James Brown said that.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.984
Same shit. We all know the story.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.978
Or at least we pretend we do.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.907
The Hindus have a
word for it, karma.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.493
They believe in reincarnation,

01:17.494 --> 01:22.081
that a man pays in the next life for all
the shit he's done in the previous one.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.083
He keeps on paying, too.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.169
Till he gets it right.

01:26.170 --> 01:30.230
Now, if I had to do it
all over again, well...

01:49.109 --> 01:51.360
Responsibility.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.154
Redemption.

01:53.155 --> 01:58.785
In order to be truly redeemed, a man
has to own up to his responsibilities.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.113
Hey, sweet thing. What's your name?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.116
Bitch.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.841
Making amends. Cats out in
Cali like to use that one a lot.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.220
Especially when they get
back from a stint in rehab.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.473
Those be the same motherfuckers
sky-paging my ass late at night

02:20.474 --> 02:22.683
a week after they got out.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.804
Ain't that a bitch?
Still, they had a point.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.903
I been away too long.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.656
Running. Hiding.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.409
Today's the day I stop
running from my past.

02:40.410 --> 02:44.497
Today's the day to
set shit straight.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.366
End of chapter 12.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.994
Quit it. Damn pervert.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.331
Quit what?

03:38.051 --> 03:42.722
Oh, shit, check it out. The
wolf is the motherfucking mack.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.477
Uh-oh.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.472
Enter the motherfucking dragon.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.072
- Why you still here?
- We were just kicking it.

04:00.073 --> 04:05.202
Just kicking it? I'm gonna kick your ass
if you don't get yourself to school.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.664
- Damn, dog, chill...
- Stay the fuck out of this, Blue.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.117
It just don't concern you.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.905
Come on. I ain't
gonna ask you again.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.712
Hey.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.809
- I'll pick you up after school, all right?
- Whatever.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.720
Damn, dog, I thought
my moms was tough.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.652
I wouldn't know.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.688
- Moon give you that address?
- Yeah.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.081
That's the fucker
I'm talking about.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.667
You told Moon you was
gonna have his two grand.

04:52.668 --> 04:56.837
Where the fuck is the money at?
I'm sorry? I really can't hear you, man.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.081
Why don't you repeat that for me?

05:11.561 --> 05:14.605
This ain't the time for
that Bruce Willis bullshit.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.692
Put your motherfucking hands
where I can see 'em at.

05:17.693 --> 05:24.115
Fucking deadbeat. See, this is
what I'm talking about right here.

05:24.116 --> 05:28.202
Don't worry, man. I'll leave you
enough to buy you a pack of Newports.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.947
And a new shirt, too, nigga.
Fucked up my boots.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.955
You make your point?

05:39.965 --> 05:42.483
Man, for sure.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.885
Got you a little bonus.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.880
That belongs to Moon, man.

05:47.931 --> 05:51.183
Nah, fuck Moon, man. He's
getting his. This interest.

05:51.184 --> 05:55.846
Then give it to him. Shit, you
know I don't play him like that.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.107
Oh, you about to
give me this speech

05:58.108 --> 06:01.110
about what a great future
we got if we trust in Moon.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.939
That nigga don't give a
fuck about you, man.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.354
After ten long years,

06:37.355 --> 06:42.268
the King has returned to reclaim
his rightful home, sweet home.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.646
And goddamn, if it don't feel good.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.317
What else can I say?

07:15.227 --> 07:17.469
Enter the motherfucking dragon.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.869
- Looky here, looky here.
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.540
Still uglier than a motherfucker.

07:37.541 --> 07:42.002
- You miss me?
- Nigga, are you insane?

07:42.003 --> 07:46.841
Ain't nobody never missed a rattlesnake.
How could somebody possibly miss you?

07:46.842 --> 07:52.513
Oh, baby, you ain't gots to be that
cold. Why don't you fix me a drink?

07:52.514 --> 07:57.176
- Gin and Squirt? Still drinking that shit?
- You don't forget shit, do you?

08:01.398 --> 08:03.023
Keep the change.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.984
You gonna have to do a
lot better than this

08:04.985 --> 08:07.361
if you wanna keep my
ass from calling Moon

08:07.362 --> 08:10.990
and telling him what kind of suicidal
fool just walked into his bar.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.368
Is that so? Dang, you
just saved me some money.

08:14.369 --> 08:19.123
I was just about to give you $100 to get him
on the horn for me, but you fucked that up.

08:19.124 --> 08:23.327
So go on and get him on
the horn. Go on, now.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.885
Sorry to disturb you, boss.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.388
There's somebody here I think
you might wanna talk to.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.265
Listen, hon. I need
somewhere private I can talk.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.518
See a champagne room
in this motherfucker?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.970
Go to the toilet if you
want some privacy.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.139
Bitch.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.533
Well, if it ain't Hemingway. Little
early for you, isn't it, honey?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.494
One of those days, you
know what I'm saying?

08:57.495 --> 09:00.456
- Try this on.
- Thank you.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.291
King.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.877
Nigga, I thought you were dead.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.088
You gonna be dead if you
ain't got my goddamn money.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.842
Well, today's your lucky day.
I'm here to make good.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.887
You know? Put things
right between us.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.798
Nigga, things ain't never
gonna be right between us.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.226
But I'm out a whole lot
of paper if you kick it.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.312
So let me calculate how
much you into me for.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.472
Bring me my book, goddamn it.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.020
This man is a fucking snake.

09:32.989 --> 09:37.993
Says here 15,000. That's not taking into
account interest and all that other shit.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.622
That sounds fair. 30. Call it 30.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.041
But, you call off the wolves.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.336
Hey, look, nigga, my word
is bond. It always has been.

09:47.337 --> 09:51.882
Unlike some other shiftless motherfuckers
I know. Yeah, nigga, I'm talking about you.

09:51.883 --> 09:55.219
If anything happens to you,
it ain't gonna be because of me.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.553
I can promise you that.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.930
I know I can count on you.

09:57.931 --> 10:02.676
I'll see your boys, right? Maybe later on,
we'll grab a drink, catch up on old times.

10:02.686 --> 10:06.096
- Don't push your luck, nigga.
- Yeah.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.693
Catch up on old times?
Ain't that some shit?

10:10.694 --> 10:14.488
Jasper. Get everybody in this
motherfucker a drink on me.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.074
Today, I'm a free man.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.903
I ain't never known you to
be so generous before, King.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.081
Yeah.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.910
Keep the change and
buy yourself a dick.

10:28.753 --> 10:34.249
Yadda yadda ying, yadda yadda yang.
So I'm like, cool. Back to the room, right?

10:34.759 --> 10:37.878
- What's up, dude?
- All right?

10:41.641 --> 10:45.561
- I'm ready to do the thing.
- What's the password?

10:45.562 --> 10:49.056
Hey, fuck your mama, bitch. Stop
playing. Open the door, nigga.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.535
Anyway...

10:53.236 --> 10:57.189
Hey, Blue. Why you wanna
talk to poor Rockie like that?

10:57.198 --> 11:00.451
You need to learn some manners,
like Mike. Right, Mike?

11:00.452 --> 11:03.912
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Rock, we cool, right?

11:03.913 --> 11:06.457
- To hell with you, then.
- You got my money?

11:06.458 --> 11:09.793
- Damn, is that all you care about?
- What else is there?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.129
Money,

11:12.130 --> 11:14.498
pussy, and money.

11:15.216 --> 11:19.261
- It's all there. Plus the interest.
- Cool.

11:19.262 --> 11:23.682
- Always know I can count on you, Mike.
- Damn, what about me?

11:23.683 --> 11:26.435
What about you, motherfucker?

11:26.436 --> 11:29.772
I got another job for y'all.
You gonna like this one, Mike.

11:29.773 --> 11:34.943
You'll never believe in a million years
who suddenly came back from the dead.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.054
Tupac?

11:37.655 --> 11:41.066
You're a funny motherfucker, boy.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.734
Who?

11:42.786 --> 11:45.445
Somebody you been waiting
for for a long time.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.501
David.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.379
You know, you never
cease to amaze me.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.507
Aren't I always telling you
how smart this boy is?

11:56.508 --> 11:58.668
All the time.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.264
- Where is he?
- Hold on, Mike.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.142
You want me to keep thinking
you're smart, act smart.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.646
King David already arranged to
pay back the money he owes me.

12:10.647 --> 12:15.058
In return, I promised he'd be in the clear.
And you know I always keep my promise.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.903
You know that about me, Mike.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.072
Now, I want you and
Blue to make the pickup

12:20.073 --> 12:23.617
and bring me back my
30Gs. End of story.

12:23.618 --> 12:27.571
That's fucked up. Why not send Rockie
to collect it, or somebody else?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.581
Cos I don't wanna send
no-fucking-body else.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.418
You keep fucking with me, Blue.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.753
Now, I want you to
view this as a test.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.880
See how you handle
yourself under pressure.

12:36.881 --> 12:41.209
Now, don't fuck this up. I don't want
it traced back to me. You understand?

12:42.345 --> 12:45.431
- Where?
- Blue Room. Six o'clock.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.183
You'll recognize the
car when you see it.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.469
Mike.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.106
Don't make me regret this.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.391
It's bullshit.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.523
Ella, let's go.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.746
Ow!

13:09.747 --> 13:12.875
I gotta do something before
we go home. Get in the car.

13:12.876 --> 13:16.086
Damn. What the hell
crawled up his ass?

13:16.087 --> 13:20.207
Yo. Just be quiet and do
as you're told, all right?

13:28.308 --> 13:32.519
- You want a refill, college boy?
- I do have a name, you know.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.563
- It's Paul.
- Whatever.

13:34.564 --> 13:38.517
You want another drink,
or what? It's paid for.

13:39.569 --> 13:44.072
- What's that guy's story, anyway?
- Who? King David?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.074
Shit.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.786
Just look up "back-stabbing
cocksucker" in the dictionary.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.989
Tell you everything
you need to know.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.785
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.528
Let me handle this, dog. You ain't in
the right state of mind right now.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.698
No, we gonna handle this. We gonna
do this just like Moon said we gonna.

14:26.699 --> 14:31.787
We gonna do this like I say. Stay in the
car, let me take care of this. All right?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.121
Mike, what's going on?

14:33.122 --> 14:36.166
- Ella, this ain't the time.
- I wasn't asking you, Blue.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.210
Don't get fucking smart!

14:38.211 --> 14:41.129
Man, what the hell
is wrong with you?

14:41.130 --> 14:43.790
That's it, man. You staying.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.348
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.949
- You King?
- Do I look like Prince, motherfucker?

15:08.950 --> 15:13.361
Let's get this shit over with,
huh? There it is. 15,000.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.915
- Moon said you owed 30, man.
- He did?

15:16.916 --> 15:22.037
Ha, I'm just fucking with you.
Never can be too sure.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.675
- You ain't gotta count it, man.
- Don't tell me what to do.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.762
You're the one who stiffed Moon, not me.
Lucky he even taking your money.

15:30.763 --> 15:35.967
- Most who cross him don't get that chance.
- Well, at least count it in the car, man.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.856
- You going camping or something?
- Excuse me?

15:40.857 --> 15:43.358
In that getup, you look
like you going camping.

15:43.359 --> 15:47.029
See, you young motherfuckers,
you don't know how to dress.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.032
What you need to do is
take some of that money,

15:50.033 --> 15:53.535
go to Canal Street, get you a Chink
tailor, make you a nice suit.

15:53.536 --> 15:57.155
Cos the women, they appreciate
a man who knows how to dress.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.000
Thanks for the tip, man.
I'm gonna give you one.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.878
I advise you get the fuck
out and stay that way.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.672
Unless you want some
more trouble. Understand?

16:05.673 --> 16:09.301
I'm not in the habit of taking
advice from Grizzly Adams.

16:09.302 --> 16:14.097
Take your ass back to the motherfucking
woods and start a campfire, all right?

16:14.098 --> 16:17.259
Go on, now. Excuse my back.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.860
You still wanna wax
this motherfucker, man?

16:26.861 --> 16:28.645
Cos I got a plan.

16:38.539 --> 16:42.659
Hey, girlfriend. Where you headed?

16:46.673 --> 16:50.250
What's up? Where are you headed?

16:51.803 --> 16:55.305
- How old are you, anyway?
- Old enough.

16:55.306 --> 17:02.387
- So, where you headed?
- Heaven, baby. Do you wanna go?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.748
Maybe.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.567
Get out of the motherfucking car.

17:07.568 --> 17:12.071
- Shit, Grizzly. What you do that for?
- Man, get out of the motherfucking car.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.566
All right. Hold your horses, man.

17:17.286 --> 17:21.205
Look at this shit. You know
what this is gonna cost to fix?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.282
Hey, man, shut the fuck up.

17:27.630 --> 17:31.133
Hey, Scarface. Tell your boy
to chill. We can work this out.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.469
- Whoa. What you call me?
- Just admiring your beauty mark, boy.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.806
You're a regular Tony
Montana, ain't you?

17:37.807 --> 17:38.933
Do you know who I am?

17:38.934 --> 17:41.451
If that was your bitch,
she came on to me.

17:41.477 --> 17:46.356
I'm asking you a question. Do
you know who the fuck I am?

17:46.357 --> 17:48.183
Nigga, do you?

17:53.656 --> 17:57.943
- Got you, motherfucker.
- Let's go, Mike. We got company, man.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.370
What the...

18:10.673 --> 18:13.425
Get in. Come on.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.670
- Open the door, open the door.
- Hey!

18:36.824 --> 18:40.660
- Somebody call 911!
- Don't let me die alone, mister.

18:40.661 --> 18:46.449
I got money. I could pay you.
Just don't let me die in the gutter.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.581
Mmm-hmm.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.750
Shit.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.586
They what?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.890
Motherfucker! Goddamn it!

19:01.891 --> 19:05.101
Jasper, no, no, no,
no, no. I appreciate it.

19:05.102 --> 19:09.564
I'm gonna apologize to you right now for
any heat that might come down on you.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.402
Now tell me, what about David?

19:13.903 --> 19:16.780
Where the fuck is he?
Who's seen him?

19:16.781 --> 19:19.658
What the fuck did they
do when they went there?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.910
- Huh?
- Mike's on the line.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.912
- Who's this?
- Mike's on the line.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.781
Jasper, let me hit you right back.

19:26.833 --> 19:31.253
- Mike.
- It's Blue. He's hurt real bad. Real bad.

19:31.254 --> 19:34.756
I fucked up, I know. But we
gotta get him to a doctor.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.967
Stupid motherfucker.

19:36.968 --> 19:41.096
- Moon, you still there? Moon?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen to me, Mike.

19:41.097 --> 19:44.090
We can't take any more chances.
Where are you now?

19:47.937 --> 19:51.765
118 and... 118 and Third.

19:51.816 --> 19:56.111
There's a parking garage on 127th.
Tell the owner that I sent you.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.530
Drive in the back. Park
your car in the back.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.448
- You got that?
- Yeah.

20:00.449 --> 20:05.120
I'll have some of my boys bring over a clean
car and we gonna take Blue to the hospital.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.581
- Are you clear on that?
- Yes. Yes.

20:07.582 --> 20:12.494
Now, is there anybody else in
the car with you besides Blue?

20:14.005 --> 20:16.172
- No.
- Mike, listen to me.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.426
You did good, baby.
Shit like this happens.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.846
You know how I take care of our
family, take care of my own.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.131
I'm just glad you came to me first.

20:25.182 --> 20:29.019
- Calm down and get to the garage.
- All right. Thanks.

20:29.020 --> 20:35.191
- Mike, are you sure you can trust him?
- He's all we got right now. Just drive.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.477
Jesus Christ.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.899
Shit. Goddamn it, Mike.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.702
Now I gotta worry about
the fucking cops again.

20:45.703 --> 20:49.447
Hit the fucking button.
Hit the button.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.411
- Red. Alvin.
- Yo, boss. What's up?

20:55.463 --> 20:57.705
I got a job for you.

21:04.555 --> 21:08.883
It's not fair. After
all I've been through.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.887
Everything I've done.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.852
- It can't end like this.
- Save your strength.

21:20.029 --> 21:26.609
Talking, it helps ease
the pain. It's all I have left.

21:29.372 --> 21:33.375
I'm not gonna make it.
Just leave me here.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.752
You'll be OK. I'll take
you to the hospital.

21:35.753 --> 21:39.339
I'm gonna stay there as long as I
need to until I'm sure you're OK.

21:39.340 --> 21:43.885
Brothers see each other buying
it every day in the street.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.596
No one lifts a finger.

21:46.597 --> 21:52.719
A white boy like you comes along,
saves my life. It's crazy.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.573
Help!

22:05.574 --> 22:07.951
Help! I got a man
hurt real bad here.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.903
- What? What?
- Come on, help.

22:12.164 --> 22:17.585
I got a son, you know, I never
knew. Maybe you could find him.

22:17.586 --> 22:23.583
- Tell him his old man was a warrior.
- Sir, you can't go any further.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.751
Oh, my God.

23:44.006 --> 23:48.418
- You should take off.
- I'm not leaving you.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.219
Hold on, dog. All right?

24:00.022 --> 24:01.681
Here they come.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.569
Stay with him.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.062
No!

24:56.579 --> 24:58.613
Get out now!

25:46.921 --> 25:50.331
Baby girl. Oh, God. Jesus.

25:50.716 --> 25:54.544
I got you. I got you, I got you.

25:55.012 --> 25:59.432
I got you. Oh, Jesus. I got you.

25:59.433 --> 26:03.019
I got you. You're gonna
be all right. All right?

26:03.020 --> 26:07.523
I got you. I got... I ain't going
nowhere, all right? Don't leave me.

26:07.524 --> 26:12.103
No, no, don't. Don't
leave. Don't leave...

26:15.074 --> 26:18.201
No. Ella...

26:18.202 --> 26:21.037
Ella... Don't leave me.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.364
Don't leave me.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.613
Mr. Paskoff?

26:55.614 --> 26:56.906
Yeah.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.535
He didn't make it. I'm sorry.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.403
Oh.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.291
Well...

27:06.292 --> 27:11.170
I guess we tried. That
should be worth something.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.380
Yes.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.907
If you'll come with me, sir,
there are some formalities...

27:15.908 --> 27:18.185
- we have to go over.
- Formalities?

27:18.186 --> 27:21.614
Yeah. Just a couple
of questions we have...

27:22.683 --> 27:26.894
Like I told you before, I didn't know
the man. I just gave him a ride.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.189
Really? Come with me.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.100
Do you know if he had
any immediate family?

27:33.193 --> 27:35.403
He did mention that he had a son.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.364
Well, he decided to make
you his beneficiary.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.274
What's up?

27:42.119 --> 27:45.246
I admit, it seems strange to
me too, but he was insistent.

27:45.247 --> 27:48.541
- I didn't know this man.
- Don't get too upset.

27:48.542 --> 27:54.881
It would appear to me that you've made
out very well in this transaction.

27:54.882 --> 27:59.093
Pink slip to his car. He
signed it over to you.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.505
- He left me his car?
- And that's not all.

28:03.432 --> 28:07.685
He asked only one thing. That you take
care of the expenses of his burial.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.479
Of course.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.857
You'll be notified when
we release the body.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.735
Ordinarily in a homicide,

28:15.736 --> 28:18.446
we're supposed to fill
out a police report,

28:18.447 --> 28:21.074
turn over personal effects
to the authorities.

28:21.075 --> 28:25.286
But, you know, that
can get complicated.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.238
Of course.

28:29.750 --> 28:33.452
Very well. Glad we got
this straightened out.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.734
What do we say when
someone gives us a present?

30:19.735 --> 30:23.521
- Thank you, Daddy.
- That's right, baby.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.909
All right, sugar.
Now it's your turn.

30:27.910 --> 30:30.244
You like that, huh?

30:30.245 --> 30:32.580
Don't give you no cavities, either.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.717
Saves some money on
those dentist bills.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.786
You know what I'm saying?

30:41.173 --> 30:48.012
Daddy got something hard for both y'all,
but it ain't candy. You wanna see it?

30:48.013 --> 30:51.641
- Who the fuck is that?
- It's important.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.435
Shit, better be important.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.721
Be right back, baby.

31:01.985 --> 31:06.113
- Rockie, what's up, man?
- I just got word from the hospital.

31:06.114 --> 31:10.568
- David passed, ten past seven.
- That's good.

31:10.619 --> 31:14.330
Somebody took him there.
Left him in the car.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.658
- Now, what if David talked?
- Who?

31:18.460 --> 31:21.912
- A white kid.
- White kid.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.832
Make some calls and
handle it for me.

31:38.238 --> 31:42.108
It's Mom. How'd your big job
interview go? Did you get it?

31:43.193 --> 31:48.239
Hey, it's Nancy. We're still on for
tonight, right? Give me a call, OK? Bye.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.034
Mr. Paskoff, this is Phillip
Waters, Sun-Telegram.

31:52.035 --> 31:55.788
I hope I didn't give you the wrong
impression in our meeting today.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.873
Your writing samples are topnotch

31:57.874 --> 32:03.004
and I'm genuinely interested in seeing what
kind of story you can come up with for us.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.581
I'll see you on Friday.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.239
The Autobiography of a King.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.242
Chapter one, "Getaway."

32:42.419 --> 32:45.579
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.007
Copped my stash from Moon.

32:48.008 --> 32:51.510
Now it's time to wave goodbye
to that motherfucker.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.555
I was gonna stick around
till Mother's Day.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.850
Figured some of my bitches would
have some extra cash for a nigga.

32:57.851 --> 33:01.771
You know, along with those
government cheques.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.307
That stupid bitch
Edna fucked that up.

33:06.068 --> 33:10.696
Had to make the phone call,
screaming her fucking head off.

33:10.697 --> 33:14.942
Well, you know. Shit happens.

33:17.079 --> 33:20.531
Anyway, plan's still on track.

33:21.750 --> 33:27.621
Three long months of footwork for Moon,
slowly gaining his trust, finally paid off.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.093
Got him to front me a half
a brick on consignment.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.261
Dummy.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.139
What the fuck was
that nigga thinking?

33:37.140 --> 33:40.476
Definitely not what I
was thinking. You know?

33:40.477 --> 33:42.103
Whoa, hold it.

33:42.104 --> 33:46.607
Moon will be looking for a nigga.
No doubt about that.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.777
And I'm sure the pigs are
gonna be on my ass too,

33:49.778 --> 33:53.781
thanks to my little
misunderstanding with Edna.

33:53.782 --> 33:57.818
But fuck you, and good
luck trying to find me.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.544
Everything's been building
up to this point.

34:06.545 --> 34:11.632
Getting out of this hellhole,
reinventing myself.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.918
LA, here I come.

34:18.014 --> 34:21.684
Whoever said there was no such
thing as a second chance in life

34:21.685 --> 34:24.145
was a stupid motherfucker.

34:24.146 --> 34:26.856
This is America.

34:26.857 --> 34:30.484
All you need is a dream and
the will to make it happen.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.322
It feels good, having
a clean slate.

34:35.322 --> 34:38.492
Got the world on the half shell
with lemon and hot sauce.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.996
Folks out here better get ready.
They ain't gonna know what...

34:44.373 --> 34:45.498
Hello?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.333
- You're still there?
- Hey, Nancy.

34:47.335 --> 34:51.045
I know it's our anniversary. You
won't believe what I experienced.

34:51.047 --> 34:55.217
- You're still at work. I'm not complaining.
- I'm waiting for you to pick me up!

34:55.217 --> 34:57.150
You know what? I
don't wanna hear it.

34:57.177 --> 34:59.847
I'm sorry. I'll explain
it all when I get there.

34:59.848 --> 35:03.926
How stupid that I
even listened to you.

35:05.395 --> 35:06.729
Rockie.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.190
- You heard anything?
- Not a word.

35:09.191 --> 35:13.394
Jesus Christ. Ain't this
a bitch? Goddamn!

35:15.113 --> 35:17.198
This shit is fucked up.

35:17.199 --> 35:21.619
I got plans, me and the twins, to go hear
this singer I'm thinking about signing.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.539
- Then all this shit with Mike.
- So how you wanna play it, boss?

35:25.540 --> 35:31.837
If that bastard Mike is breathing out
there, anywhere, I want him taken care of.

35:31.838 --> 35:36.091
And the white boy witness motherfucker,
I want him taken care of too.

35:36.092 --> 35:40.054
I cannot have this shit come back
and bite me in my goddamn ass.

35:40.055 --> 35:46.727
Everything I worked for, everything can
come tumbling down on our fucking heads.

35:46.728 --> 35:50.431
Shit. You're running
shit, handle it.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.603
This is Mike. Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.341
- You didn't go to the police?
- Please, Nancy, keep it down.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.709
No, I will not keep it down.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.263
A pimp bled to death in that thing

37:46.264 --> 37:48.807
and you're acting like
everything's just fine and dandy.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.051
I can't explain it.

37:53.229 --> 37:57.349
If you just could have been
there. He had this nobility.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.943
Nobility?

37:58.944 --> 38:02.196
I need to find out
why this man died.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.407
- For my story.
- For your story?

38:05.408 --> 38:08.077
Do you even hear
what you're saying?

38:08.078 --> 38:12.206
This is not a rap video or a
Quentin Tarantino movie, Paul.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.709
This is real life. Your life.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.338
Your whole slumming thing, you
staying uptown in that hellhole,

38:19.339 --> 38:22.883
when you could be living down here
with me, I've put up with it, I have.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.595
- That's a cheap shot, Nancy.
- What? Slumming?

38:26.596 --> 38:29.056
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're a serious artist,

38:29.057 --> 38:33.102
injecting yourself into an exotic
milieu for research purposes, right?

38:33.103 --> 38:36.146
Isn't that how you once put it?

38:36.147 --> 38:40.184
So, what? Is dating me a
part of your research?

38:47.701 --> 38:50.485
Call me when you get a life.

39:11.391 --> 39:15.052
Snatched up a little
crib near the beach.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.653
Figured I'd check shit out for a
few days before setting up shop.

39:24.654 --> 39:27.898
See if I could make
some connections.

40:30.345 --> 40:33.964
I made a connection, all right.

40:34.891 --> 40:38.635
Mmm-mmm.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.562
So, you ready to go again?

40:48.571 --> 40:53.567
- Are you?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.902
Her name was Janet.

40:56.830 --> 40:59.164
I ain't been in Cali but 24 hours

40:59.165 --> 41:03.585
and already copped me a white broad that
looked like a motherfucking movie star.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.672
Or TV, anyway.

41:06.673 --> 41:09.842
The show is called SurfBeat.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.844
My character's Pepper.

41:11.845 --> 41:15.722
She's the scatterbrained
but lovable associate

41:15.723 --> 41:18.725
at the Zuma Beach Detective Agency.

41:18.726 --> 41:24.523
- Gotta be serious money in that.
- It's not as good as it sounds, sweetie.

41:24.524 --> 41:28.235
It's just cable and
it's only recurring.

41:28.236 --> 41:31.321
Oh! Watch out, watch
out, watch out.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.658
- Those new shoes you got.
- I know.

41:34.659 --> 41:37.361
Can we go back to the hotel
and do some more blow?

41:45.253 --> 41:48.088
Damn, David.

41:48.089 --> 41:51.133
This is strong. Maybe
you ought to cut it.

41:51.134 --> 41:55.262
That stupid bitch didn't even know the
difference between coke and heroin.

41:55.263 --> 41:59.091
Fuck, it's all I had. And I didn't
have the heart to tell her.

42:00.268 --> 42:03.470
Oh, well. She'd find
out eventually.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.681
They always do.

42:07.066 --> 42:10.644
Within a few weeks,
business was booming.

42:11.946 --> 42:15.449
Everybody wanted
what I had to offer.

42:15.450 --> 42:19.486
I didn't even have to act like it
was coke no more. As for Janet...

42:24.292 --> 42:28.670
Cut! Cut, cut, cut! Let's
do another one, please.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.497
She wasn't doing too hot.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.959
What's the matter, honey? You can't
seem to get any energy going.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.922
Hey! We need you for this shot.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.675
- She still had her job, though.
- Asshole.

42:43.770 --> 42:47.139
Yo. Janet had it bad.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.983
But I took care of her.

42:49.984 --> 42:56.815
After all, she was really good about
hooking me up with her co-workers.

43:02.830 --> 43:06.333
Sometimes I'd get a kick out of just
watching the show and wondering

43:06.334 --> 43:10.379
if the rest of the world could tell which
members of the cast were strung out.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.006
Just looking at them
motherfuckers made me laugh.

43:13.007 --> 43:16.376
Cos I knew I could bring their
whole world crumbling down

43:16.386 --> 43:18.753
whenever I felt like
pulling the string.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.760
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Yeah, but you can't live without me.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.313
Oh, really?

43:28.314 --> 43:32.567
I used to think your living in LA for too
long would give you a big head, David.

43:32.568 --> 43:37.531
- Thank God I was wrong.
- But what would you do without me?

43:37.532 --> 43:40.066
Whatever.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.862
You'll see.

43:45.123 --> 43:48.074
Oh, yeah. She'd definitely see.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.473
- We're closed, man.
- My window's busted.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.635
- You're the only garage around.
- Sorry.

44:07.562 --> 44:10.105
I'll make it worth your while.

44:10.106 --> 44:13.433
OK. I'll get you a ticket.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.968
What's the password?

46:16.023 --> 46:19.151
- Put that thing down, man.
- Mike, Moon's not here.

46:19.152 --> 46:22.195
- Where is he?
- Don't go out like that, my brother.

46:22.196 --> 46:24.281
Mike, me and you, we'll
work something out.

46:24.282 --> 46:27.651
What are we gonna work out, Rock?

46:28.744 --> 46:30.362
Ella's gone.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.866
She's gone?

46:37.211 --> 46:38.828
Where is he?

46:39.464 --> 46:40.755
By now,

46:40.756 --> 46:44.509
I'd pretty much burned through
the stash I copped from Moon.

46:44.510 --> 46:49.339
Those entertainment types
in LA are fiends. Who knew?

46:49.390 --> 46:53.810
It was a good ride.
I cleared 25Gs easy.

46:53.811 --> 46:57.564
But if I was to keep this shit going,
I'd need to do some re-ing up.

46:57.565 --> 47:00.016
Make myself a West
Coast connection.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.603
Easier said than done.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.700
Who could guess a
two-bit chump like Moon

47:08.701 --> 47:11.244
would have better dope
than anybody in LA?

47:11.245 --> 47:16.583
I guess the real junkies, the ones who
know their shit, are all back East.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.668
They're scared of the sunshine.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.588
Way I see it, though, that
means a golden opportunity

47:21.589 --> 47:26.626
for anybody out here who could
provide some quality shit.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.972
Yep, ain't no doubt about it.

47:30.973 --> 47:35.101
Heroin is definitely an industry
with some serious growth potential.

47:35.102 --> 47:38.304
And I planned to invest heavily.

47:38.606 --> 47:42.267
Eventually, I hooked up with some
Vietnamese cats out in Alhambra.

47:42.276 --> 47:45.570
I hear brothers screaming about
dirty gook motherfuckers.

47:45.571 --> 47:50.108
Say what you want, them motherfuckers
know how to conduct business.

47:52.453 --> 47:58.667
Janet could've learned a thing or two
about a thing or two from them. For real.

48:00.127 --> 48:03.037
- Just a minute.
- No. Now!

48:08.135 --> 48:10.178
This is David. Leave it.

48:10.179 --> 48:13.659
Hi, David. It's me. I don't
give a fuck where you are.

48:13.661 --> 48:18.511
Please, it's a fucking emergency.
I ran out, OK? So, please...

48:19.438 --> 48:23.483
I really need you, OK?
So call me back.

48:27.488 --> 48:29.781
- You know the bitch lost her job.
- Sorry.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.700
Right before the third season.

48:31.701 --> 48:36.037
Had the nerve to blame me. Like I
had something to do with that shit.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.914
And me?

48:37.915 --> 48:40.533
I wound up losing interest.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.673
She found herself a new job.

48:46.674 --> 48:49.501
It paid the bills.

48:55.766 --> 48:59.177
Left me with time to
focus on other things.

49:18.789 --> 49:21.916
I'd buy you a drink but you
probably get 'em on the house.

49:21.917 --> 49:25.837
Gee, I never heard that one before.

49:25.838 --> 49:27.789
What's your name, girl?

49:28.799 --> 49:30.041
Busy.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.921
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

49:34.930 --> 49:37.599
It's only vodka. Won't stain.

49:37.600 --> 49:41.353
- So, what's your name?
- Look, I'm sorry but I'm really busy.

49:41.354 --> 49:43.146
I mean, come on. Looking
as good as you do?

49:43.147 --> 49:44.639
I just wanna know your name.

49:45.733 --> 49:48.735
- Juanita.
- Pretty name.

49:48.736 --> 49:50.987
I'm David. My friends call me King.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.907
Oh, let me guess. You're
looking for a queen?

49:53.908 --> 49:56.710
You don't cut a brother
no slack, do you?

49:56.911 --> 50:02.248
Well, you know, we meet a lot of creeps in
here. Look, sorry again about your drink.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.585
How about you let me take you
out to dinner this weekend?

50:05.586 --> 50:08.046
Oh, I can't. I'm studying.

50:08.047 --> 50:14.010
Oh, college girl. I should've guessed.
You don't really fit in with this crowd.

50:14.011 --> 50:18.014
- How about next weekend?
- Midterms.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.934
- Can I call?
- I'll tell you what.

50:20.935 --> 50:26.272
I'm working next Thursday. Come back
and ask me then and we'll see. OK?

50:26.273 --> 50:29.893
- I'll do that.
- Now, if you'll excuse me.

50:31.904 --> 50:38.785
She was everything a man could want.
Beautiful, intelligent, uncorrupted.

50:38.786 --> 50:44.157
I promised myself right then
and there she'd be mine.

50:54.969 --> 50:58.004
I'll be right back.
I gotta hit the head.

51:38.262 --> 51:39.963
Shit.

51:42.516 --> 51:44.309
Who the fuck is this?

51:44.310 --> 51:47.896
Oh. It's OK, Jasper.
You didn't know.

51:47.897 --> 51:50.106
What's going on?

51:50.107 --> 51:54.310
Now, slow down, slow down.
Give it to me again.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.231
I'm on it. It's all good.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.401
OK.

52:01.994 --> 52:05.488
Give me a second.
This is business, OK?

52:10.419 --> 52:12.045
- Yeah? Uh-huh.
- Yo, Larry.

52:12.046 --> 52:13.880
- You at Mike's?
- Uh-huh.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.840
- Did he show?
- No. No sign of him.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.467
I need you to go down
to the Blue Room.

52:17.468 --> 52:20.804
That white boy's there.
Make him disappear.

52:20.805 --> 52:23.089
All right.

53:10.479 --> 53:15.558
It's on the house, honey. Don't
go nowhere. I'll be right back.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.607
Wait. Wait!

53:26.036 --> 53:27.695
Hey, J!

53:50.811 --> 53:52.979
You already missed him. Nice going.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.648
- Where the fuck did he go?
- How should I know?

53:55.649 --> 54:00.111
He's the only white boy around here and
he's driving around in a pimped-out Stutz.

54:00.112 --> 54:02.355
He shouldn't be that hard to find.

54:18.172 --> 54:22.166
Thursday came, and not
a moment too soon.

54:23.177 --> 54:27.213
Operation Juanita
was in full effect.

54:33.896 --> 54:36.022
Again, girl? Who they from?

54:36.023 --> 54:37.857
Shh.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.685
What does it say?

54:43.822 --> 54:45.281
After I finish this semester,

54:45.282 --> 54:48.534
I plan to stay on and get my
graduate's degree in social work.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.079
You know, help out
disadvantaged children.

54:51.080 --> 54:55.208
It's important to
give back, you know?

54:55.209 --> 54:57.210
I think we should check the car.

54:57.211 --> 54:59.545
You might have left your
halo on the back seat.

54:59.546 --> 55:01.589
Are you making fun of me now?

55:01.590 --> 55:05.051
You're not like any other
girl I've ever dated before.

55:05.052 --> 55:08.930
You're a strong sister. Ambitious.

55:08.931 --> 55:14.352
- But I know what your weakness is.
- Really? OK, well, I'm all ears.

55:14.353 --> 55:17.680
Same thing make you
laugh, make you cry.

55:19.441 --> 55:22.894
Your strength is your weakness.

55:23.278 --> 55:26.856
Turns out that wasn't her only one.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.067
Shit.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.572
David!

55:37.376 --> 55:40.586
- Can I try some?
- Sure.

55:40.587 --> 55:44.757
Guess there ain't a bitch alive who don't
like a little coke every now and then.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.844
Makes them kinda freaky too.

55:47.845 --> 55:52.048
Truth be told, they were
freaks to begin with.

57:04.379 --> 57:06.881
What's this?

57:06.882 --> 57:11.085
I think it's about time
you got your own place.

57:12.012 --> 57:15.214
You're breaking up with me?

57:18.310 --> 57:19.727
- David.
- You gonna help?

57:19.728 --> 57:23.055
Or stand there talking
about "David, David?"

57:27.694 --> 57:30.863
- What's her name?
- Does it matter?

57:30.864 --> 57:33.658
She moving in here with you?

57:33.659 --> 57:37.611
You know, I haven't asked her yet.
But I'm hoping she will.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.581
You must really like her.

57:53.053 --> 57:56.514
Guess I can't say I
didn't see this coming.

57:56.515 --> 57:59.925
Look, it's not like I'm firing you.

58:00.769 --> 58:03.896
You're a smart girl and
a damn good worker.

58:03.897 --> 58:06.891
You got a job as long as you want.

58:08.569 --> 58:10.853
Great.

58:12.072 --> 58:14.523
You're a real motherfucking saint.

58:21.623 --> 58:25.993
- Oh, Mom doesn't drink.
- I'm sorry about that.

58:29.256 --> 58:33.209
To the most beautiful member
of the graduating class.

58:35.596 --> 58:39.807
So, what line of work did you
say you were in again, Mr...

58:39.808 --> 58:42.593
David. My friends call me David.

58:43.812 --> 58:46.898
Various investments around town.

58:46.899 --> 58:50.643
I'd have to say my primary source
of income would be exporting.

58:50.652 --> 58:51.819
Oh.

58:51.820 --> 58:54.280
I have to go to the
little girls' room.

58:54.281 --> 58:56.524
Excuse me.

59:13.759 --> 59:17.136
I think we should move in together.

59:17.137 --> 59:21.632
- You're kidding, right?
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

59:22.476 --> 59:26.387
- I can't move in with you, David.
- Why not?

59:29.316 --> 59:31.484
I don't approve of your lifestyle.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.611
I don't recall you complaining

59:33.612 --> 59:36.322
when you were snorting up
everything I put in front of you.

59:36.323 --> 59:39.992
- You're missing the point.
- Check it.

59:39.993 --> 59:42.536
I got like 150 grand saved up.

59:42.537 --> 59:45.498
Pump it up to like 250,
get a house in the country,

59:45.499 --> 59:47.333
just get away from all this shit.

59:47.334 --> 59:49.502
Baby, you're small-time.

59:49.503 --> 59:51.837
And you always will be.

59:51.838 --> 59:58.878
You think a quarter of a mil is enough to
retire on? A quarter of a mil ain't shit.

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:08.679
Aw, did I hurt your feelings? Look,
I'm just trying to be honest with you.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.692
Baby, look at me.

01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:14.735
Look at me.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.188
Now, I like partying with you.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.907
And I love fucking you.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:21.867
But that's where it ends.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.954
Now, why turn it into
something that it's not?

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:29.333
Let's just have fun while it lasts.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:32.036
OK?

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:40.761
Yeah, we'll do that.
While it lasts.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:44.256
She had me wrapped around her
little finger and she knew it.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:47.685
I used to laugh when I heard
niggas talk about being in love.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.271
Even writing the word
makes me feel helpless.

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:51.814
But it's true.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:56.110
I'd never felt this way about another
person in my life, except my mother.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:01:00.573
And I didn't like it. I mean this
from the bottom of my heart.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.784
I hated this feeling
that I had for Juanita.

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:08.414
It made me feel like I was...
Like I was weak.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.411
And we couldn't have that.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:26.140
They say revenge is a
dish best served cold.

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:29.518
I was about to take my shit right
out the motherfucking freezer.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.729
Bitch thought she was
gonna get by without me,

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.473
she'd be thinking again real soon.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:38.778
Might as well call me
a broken-down trick.

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:42.448
Using me for my money and telling
me a quarter mil ain't good enough?

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.492
A quarter mil's always good.

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:52.493
It was good then and it
sure in hell's still good now.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:04.628
Still good now... Still good now...

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:19.652
- Don't shoot. I'll give you...
- Shut up. All I need is a ride.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.895
Get in.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.937
Just keep driving.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:53.487
Whoa, stop the car,
stop the car. Back up.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.741
Slowly.

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:04.915
Right here, right here, right here.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:41.544
Why was the tiger scared?

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:44.380
- Why?
- It was rated Rrrr.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:47.383
- That's some funny shit.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.668
Come here.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.555
Uh-uh.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:55.182
- Yeah. What do you say?
- Thank you, Daddy.

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:59.303
That's right, baby. Now
give your sister some.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.190
Come on, baby.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:06.151
But don't drop it. What the fuck...

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.445
What the fuck did
you do? Goddamn it!

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.190
Oh, shit. Get my phone.

01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:13.233
Shit.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.792
Hello?

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:25.963
Motherfucker's hung up. All right,
bitch, tell me another joke.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.293
Mike. Son.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:19.725
- Yeah?
- Hey, Moon.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:25.806
They spotted the white boy at the garage.
We followed him north on Fifth Street.

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:30.903
Responsibility.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.604
Redemption.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:37.776
In order to be truly redeemed, a man
has to own up to his responsibilities.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:43.540
Tuesday, moving day.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:46.785
It didn't have to come to this
but the bitch left me no choice.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:51.006
Three months of planning
had finally paid off.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.793
Unfortunately, a little too well.

01:06:58.098 --> 01:07:01.975
You bastard. Why haven't
you been returning my calls?

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:06.355
- I went out of town, man. I didn't tell you?
- No, you didn't tell me.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.942
- Aren't you gonna open the door?
- Not if you continue in that tone of voice.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:13.645
- Open the fucking door!
- Try asking nicely.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:17.441
Please!

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:24.957
So, what seems to be the problem?

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:28.669
You know damn well what the
problem is. You did this to me.

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:32.840
I did this to you? I didn't put a gun to
your head and make you sniff no coke.

01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:37.461
You didn't give me coke,
you fucker. You gave me heroin.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:39.838
That's right. I did.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:44.343
So, what do you want me to do?

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.148
Baby, I just need a fix.

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:53.068
Look, just for today, OK? You know?
Just to get me through it. Please?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.778
- Right.
- Just one, OK?

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:58.490
Yeah. But you know us small-timers.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:02.828
You know, we gots to
watch every penny, and...

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.906
Don't look like you have a penny.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:10.035
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.676
She was right.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:20.261
I did do this to her.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.546
And I was enjoying it.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.267
Funny shit was,

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.810
I still loved her.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:30.389
Maybe more now than ever.

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:34.017
Because I finally felt
needed, appreciated.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.738
Come on back, any time.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:54.371
Thing is, Juanita got more strung out
than I ever could have imagined.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.756
Bitch started shooting right away.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.426
Most girls are scared of needles.
Keeps it from getting out of control.

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:03.839
Not Juanita. Turns out
she was diabetic.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:11.304
For her, sticking herself was like brushing
her teeth or going to the bathroom.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:19.770
It don't take a rocket scientist to figure
out that eventually something had to give.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:40.917
- Yeah?
- I need help.

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.492
Look, there's a clinic up north.

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:47.198
It's the best in the state
and I wanna check myself in.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:51.303
But it's expensive. 10,000 a month.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:57.025
And I know it's a lot of
money, but I need this.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.444
You have to help me.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:02.614
If you don't, I'll
go to the police.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:06.118
Bitches don't realize they should
never joke about the police.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.036
Breaking a man's
heart is one thing.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.747
Fucking with his livelihood
is something else.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:16.336
I knew you'd see things my way.
I'll meet you at eight.

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:21.383
I wonder how she felt inside after hanging
up that phone, what was on her mind.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:23.552
Like the sunset that day.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:26.638
Do you think it occurred
to her for a split second

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:29.841
that it was the last one
she was ever gonna see?

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:37.774
You know that thing Yogi Berra used
to say, "Déjà vu all over again?"

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:39.776
Might as well been
talking about me.

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:42.279
Here I am trying to resolve
things with Juanita,

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.406
and it's just like the mess
I'd gotten myself into

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.701
the day I left the
East Coast, with Edna.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:50.547
I mean it, King. I need money.

01:10:50.549 --> 01:10:52.956
For what? So you can shoot
it in your fucking veins?

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:56.001
I told you, I'm clean now.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.295
Six weeks.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.796
I've heard that one before.

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:02.799
Now, you think I like
asking you for money?

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.421
There's no food in the house.
The kids need clothes for school.

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:13.385
You know, you owe this to me.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.108
I'll go to the police.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.945
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.230
Don't do that.

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:29.401
I'll be right over.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:35.248
Edna. Yeah, I used to run around
with her back in the day.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:38.377
Bad-ass bitch before that
junk got hold of her.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:42.047
Somehow she got it in her head
that I was the father of her boy

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:47.419
and conveniently waited till now, ten years
after the fact, to break the news to me.

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:50.722
Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:54.059
But she wasn't gonna do her kids
any good if she was still using.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.313
And I sure as hell wasn't gonna do
them any good rotting in a jail cell.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.732
So I decided to give her a test,

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.727
to see if she was on the level.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.865
Well, aren't you gonna let me in?

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:12.744
- I'm glad you came.
- So am I.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:16.281
I'm sure we can work
this thing out.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:22.120
- Got something to drink?
- Yeah, go ahead. Help yourself.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:28.335
You ain't got nothing to
eat in this motherfucker.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:34.799
You mind? I don't want to eat
you out of house and home.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.766
Damn.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.694
It is hotter than a
motherfucker out there.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.563
David, I need help.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:58.123
Baby. You ain't gots to
be like that with me.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:03.328
Come here.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:10.168
What the fuck is wrong with you,
threatening to call the police on me, bitch?

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:15.590
- You out of your motherfucking mind.
- Leave her alone!

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:19.803
- Get out of here, little nigga.
- Leave him alone.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:24.015
Look at you.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.311
This what you want the money for?

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.398
You better enjoy it.

01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:34.693
It's the last thing you're
getting from me, boo.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:36.987
Get the fuck out of my way.

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:48.131
Didn't stick around long enough to
see if she ever did pass that test.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:52.919
What I did was hit the airport.
Got me a one-way to LA.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.574
Mom!

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.254
Mommy. Mommy!

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:31.207
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.135
Aren't you gonna let me in?

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.150
Déjà vu.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:50.435
All over again.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.590
I drifted around for a
while, ducking the law.

01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:14.959
Worked my way East from
small town to small town.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.763
But something was calling
me back. I missed my home.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:22.684
Plus it's hard living on the run,
especially when it's your fault.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:25.478
Getting yourself stuck in the
same fucked-up situation

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:28.273
you ran away from ten years ago.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:32.068
The Lord takes care of fools and
babies. I've never been either one.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:35.325
So I'm back, and it's time for
King to put things right,

01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:40.285
face up to my responsibilities, to
Moon, to Edna's boy, to myself.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:43.246
Responsibility. Redemption.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:46.041
In order to be truly be
redeemed, a man has to...

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.919
Get out the car! Get out the
motherfucking car, white boy.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.879
Get out the motherfucking car.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.173
- Get out the car now!
- OK.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:55.133
- Do it now!
- All right.

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:58.211
- Get out the car!
- Please don't kill me!

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:04.851
Motherfucker, I'm gonna count
to three. One. Two. Three.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:17.313
Don't come near me!
I'll kill you! I mean it!

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:32.420
You. If you're worried about me going
to the police, I didn't, I swear.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:37.876
I don't care about that. Now, put the
gun down. I ain't gonna hurt you.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:47.760
- What's your name?
- Paul.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:51.389
What the fuck is a white boy like you
doing uptown in a dead man's car, Paul?

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:56.478
He gave it to me before he died.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.897
He give you that ring too?

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:05.236
Take your ass home, man.
You don't belong here.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.530
I need to know why.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:15.914
- Why what?
- Why did you kill him?

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:20.460
- He deserved it.
- Believe me, I know.

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:24.255
But why'd you kill him?

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.434
He killed my mother.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.312
Edna?

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.902
The man that you killed

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.240
was your father.

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:57.205
You see, he has these tapes of...

01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:01.626
I've been listening to 'em.

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:07.257
See, when he was dying,
he asked me to bury him.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.810
He begged for a decent burial.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.105
Hallowed ground.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:28.578
Oh! Man.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:32.374
Hurry. Come on. You
gotta get out of here.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:37.253
Take the car. There's a quarter-million
dollars in the trunk. It's yours.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:38.713
You're free. Go!

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.790
Get out of here! Go!

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.631
Go.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.299
An amazing story.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.385
Truly amazing.

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:27.846
- But I can't print it.
- Why not?

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:30.298
This is a newspaper,
not a fiction magazine.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:31.883
But it's true, all of it.

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:35.386
The stabbing, the hospital.
I had a gun pointed at my head.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:41.225
You're a great writer. If it's
a job you want, you're hired.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.770
But that?

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:50.818
Unfortunately, I don't
believe a word of it.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:56.082
Tell you the truth, I probably
wouldn't have believed it, either.

01:19:56.083 --> 01:20:01.704
After all, I did live a
pretty extraordinary life.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:06.334
It's too bad it had to catch
up with me when it did.

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:10.088
Before I had a chance
to turn the corner.

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:15.718
And write the final chapter.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.448
Fate's a funny thing,

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.118
when you think about it.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:49.293
How everything is interconnected,
like a game of dominoes.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.438
How one man's life can have
such a powerful effect,

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:04.142
however inadvertent, on the
lives of so many others.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:15.319
How it can transform itself into
a gift that keeps on giving.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:30.134

pretty extraordinary.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:36.140
In the end, I suppose it all comes
back to the whole karma thing.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.476
Who knows?

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.563

as the Hindus say,

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:45.308
I may just get a second
chance after all.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.444
I wonder.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:51.689
What lies ahead for
me on the other side?

01:21:52.305 --> 01:21:58.627
