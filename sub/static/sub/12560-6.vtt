00:00.430 --> 00:01.580
I'm hank.

00:01.580 --> 00:05.400
I was your typicalemergency room doctor, until I got fired.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.810
He let a billionaire hospitaltrustee die to save some kidoff the street.

00:08.810 --> 00:10.810
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:10.810 --> 00:11.790
This is my brother.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.600
I'm evan R.Lawson, cpa.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.430
He took me away from mytroubles and to the hamptons.

00:17.430 --> 00:20.970
And suddenlyI had a chance to become a whole new kind of doctor.

00:20.970 --> 00:25.810
Turns out the wealthyand not so wealthy out here could use a guywho makes house calls.

00:25.810 --> 00:30.220
So I got a second chance to dowhat I do best.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.990
So...

00:47.610 --> 00:50.990
so...

00:51.670 --> 00:57.810
so that happened, finally.

00:57.810 --> 01:03.550
Not that I wasgetting impatient.I just meant that--did--never mind.

01:04.739 --> 01:06.440
Boy, I'm relieved.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.360
That it finally happened.

01:08.360 --> 01:13.050
No, that you're even worse at having thisconversation than I am.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.370
Happy to help out.

01:15.370 --> 01:19.550
I gotta ask,what is that tattoo about?

01:19.550 --> 01:21.340
It's from my crazy days.

01:21.340 --> 01:24.700
You know,sowing my wild oats, acting on impulse?

01:24.700 --> 01:25.720
You know how it is.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.870
Not really.

01:26.870 --> 01:30.590
Wait, you're telling methat you never went through a rebellious phase?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.720
I didn't go to an ivy leaguemed school.Does that count?

01:32.720 --> 01:35.260
You have to have a rebelliousphase, hank.Everybody does.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.670
I disagree.I mean, why?

01:37.670 --> 01:42.570
So you can have an awkwardconversation about it the morningafter you sleep with someone.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.030
Well, we were doing thatjust fine before all this.

01:45.030 --> 01:47.670
Now that we agree on.

01:52.930 --> 01:56.930
I can think of something elsewe will definitely agree on.

01:56.930 --> 01:58.550
Breakfast in bed.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.050
No, that's too much trouble.

02:00.050 --> 02:03.450
But a couple of bowls, spoons,a box, and some milk.

02:03.450 --> 02:06.230
Okay.You're right, that isn'tany trouble at all.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.420
See?

02:07.420 --> 02:09.539
Was that so hard?

02:15.940 --> 02:17.670
Tucker.What's going on?

02:17.670 --> 02:22.040
Uh, I know this is kind ofan aggressive move showing up at your doorstep,

02:22.040 --> 02:24.000
butI have an aggressive dilemma.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.330
No, no.Come on in.

02:28.460 --> 02:31.220
Uh, you know what,why don't we go outside, okay?

02:31.220 --> 02:33.210
Come on.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.430
$87.

02:42.430 --> 02:46.790
Wow,that's more than I spent buying women cocktailslast night.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.370
Keep it, man.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.520
Ciao.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.690
I really need a car.

03:03.070 --> 03:05.040
Why would you think libby'scheating on you?

03:05.040 --> 03:10.110
Because, after she borrowedmy laptop, there were pregnancy websitesin the browser history,

03:10.110 --> 03:18.960
and she's been moody,and she's been tired, and her chestal area,

03:18.960 --> 03:22.410
has undergone, like,an extreme growth spurt.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.080
And, how is it you know theseare pregnancy indicators?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.810
From the pregnancy websites.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.040
You read them too?

03:29.040 --> 03:30.670
You know, when in rome.

03:30.670 --> 03:35.550
Okay, look,even if she is pregnant, that doesn't meanshe's cheating on you.

03:35.550 --> 03:39.580
Well, it doesif we've never slept together.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.460
Oh, yeah, it kinda does.

03:43.460 --> 03:46.290
I love her, hank.

03:46.290 --> 03:49.490
Or I--or, I did.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.940
Then talk to her.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.990
And listen to what she says, even if it isn'twhat you want to hear.

03:53.990 --> 03:57.100
'Cause maybe this isa misunderstanding and maybe it's not,

03:57.100 --> 04:00.900
but, either way,you can't solve it alone.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.450
Well, good morning, jill.

04:06.450 --> 04:08.270
Good morning.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.100
Um, have you seen hank?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.670
He's outside, in an embm.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.030
Early morning business meeting.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.300
Looks likeyou had fun last night.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.529
Looks like hank did too.

04:20.529 --> 04:23.790
I'd expect a more maturereaction from someone eating fruity puffs.

04:23.790 --> 04:27.240
Actually, fruity puffsare high in calcium.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.890
They help strengthen your bonesand teeth.

04:28.890 --> 04:30.420
- That's the milk.
- Really?

04:30.420 --> 04:31.540
Yeah, really.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.930
Boy, these are horriblefor you.

04:32.930 --> 04:34.460
- Hey, jill.
- Jesus.

04:34.460 --> 04:37.630
Tucker, hi.How are you?

04:37.630 --> 04:41.230
Uh, in an existential crisis.You?

04:42.850 --> 04:45.130
Wait for it.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.880
It's urgent.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.310
Uh, is-may ewberg-nay?

04:51.310 --> 04:53.120
Ms.Newparts newberg?

04:53.120 --> 04:54.250
Hell of an encryption system.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.610
I'm operatingon very little sleep.

04:55.610 --> 04:56.910
I'll let you guysget to work.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.110
I'll walk you to your car.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.860
So, yeah, we've neverofficially met, but I've heard a lot about you.

05:03.860 --> 05:05.440
Evan R.Lawson, cfo of hankmed.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.490
Tucker bryant, 16.

05:07.490 --> 05:08.500
Cool.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.060
So that's your ferrarioutside, huh?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.480
Yeah, one of them.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.340
Oh, my god,that must be nice.

05:13.340 --> 05:16.310
Last night,I was at this club, I was hitting on the hottestgirl there--

05:16.310 --> 05:18.120
like, by far, the hottest girl there.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.060
She was a model from wilhemina, and I was right about to closethe deal,

05:21.060 --> 05:23.920
like, right, right, right there, and then she foundout I didn't have a car.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.960
- You know what she said?
- Wait, hold-you don't have a car?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.340
That's exactly what she said.

05:27.340 --> 05:28.950
Like, even the way she said it.

05:28.950 --> 05:31.120
I heard that like three timeslast night.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.960
Well, listen,dad does a lot of business with bridgehampton motors.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.730
Tell them marshall bryantsent you.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.320
- They'll hook you up.
- Really?

05:38.320 --> 05:40.750
- Yeah.
- Thanks, man.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.290
No problem, dude.

05:42.290 --> 05:45.140
It was niceto meet you, I gotta go.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.610
You know what?

05:47.610 --> 05:50.760
Uh, let me return the favor by dropping some of my lady-knowledge on you.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.490
Your "lady-knowledge"?

05:52.490 --> 05:57.200
Yeah, knowledge about ladies.Not just stuff ladies know.You know, lady-knowledge.You know, I get around.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.290
Without a car?

05:58.290 --> 05:59.520
Let's not dwell on that, okay?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.780
Let's just move past that.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.820
Thank heaven you're here.

06:07.820 --> 06:13.100
Oh, sore throat, cough, fever,mucous.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.390
It started a couple of days agoand I'm worried, hank.

06:16.390 --> 06:21.010
She's my right hand and my leftand sometimes my brain.

06:21.010 --> 06:24.430
Esperanza, I told youto go to bed.

06:24.430 --> 06:27.440
You should be convalescing,not cleaning.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.410
And let your tchotchkesgo undusted?

06:29.410 --> 06:31.170
How could I live with myself?

06:31.170 --> 06:33.650
And I told you,I don't need a doctor.

06:35.230 --> 06:37.850
Hank is more than a doctor.He's family.

06:37.850 --> 06:40.920
Now sit down and I'm going toget you something to drink.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.920
All right, esperanza.Let me have a look at you.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.570
Why don't you sit downover here?

06:45.570 --> 06:48.480
Okay, would you openyour mouth, please?

06:53.770 --> 06:55.630
Deep breath in.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.960
Out.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.070
And again.

07:03.310 --> 07:05.430
I hear cracklingin the right base.

07:05.430 --> 07:08.450
Sounds like pneumonia.

07:08.870 --> 07:10.560
101.2.

07:10.560 --> 07:15.570
Okay, rest, fluids,some antibiotics, and you'll be back on your feetin no time.

07:15.570 --> 07:17.310
No time is too much time.

07:17.310 --> 07:20.250
I need to be betterby tomorrow to help ms.Newbergwith the event.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.460
You need to stay in bed.

07:21.460 --> 07:25.620
It's a religious riteof passage, and it's important to her.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.320
She needs me, and I'm not going tolet her down.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.140
Yeah.One sec, esperanza.

07:31.140 --> 07:36.490
If she exerts herselfin this condition, we'll be back herein 24 hours looking ata more severe case.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.030
I mean, there has to be a waywe can help her.

07:38.030 --> 07:42.390
A liter of fibrocedextrosein normal saline, two milligramsmagnesium sulfate,

07:42.390 --> 07:44.500
100 mils thiamine,a mil of folic acid.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.530
- Banana bag.
- Exactly.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.260
If it gets me on my feet,I'll eat six bags.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.530
Esperanza, you don't need todo anything but lie there.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.960
You sound like my husband.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.750
Okay.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.780
Find a place to hang it.

08:17.870 --> 08:20.330
Okay, you're all set.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.420
I'll check on you tomorrow.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.330
The doctor says I'll be okayby tomorrow.

08:24.330 --> 08:28.840
Oh, hank.My man.My miracle worker.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.240
You're always there for me.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.600
Cometo the bark mitzvah, I insist.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.940
I'm sorry,did you say "bark" mitzvah.

08:35.940 --> 08:39.710
Yes, for our good little boykoufax.

08:39.710 --> 08:43.210
Tomorrow, he's a man.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.860
But today, he's a dog?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.560
Nevertheless, he's family.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.550
My husband was jewish, and this is how we agreedto raise the children.

08:53.550 --> 08:54.890
So, you'll come?

08:54.890 --> 09:03.020
Uh, mostly to keep an eyeon esperanza, and to see your dogbecome a man.

09:30.970 --> 09:34.060
Ous, but I bet they don't make a bowl of cereal like I do.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.630
I bet they make it faster.

09:35.630 --> 09:36.820
Again, I'm sorry about that.

09:36.820 --> 09:40.320
And again, it's okay.It's not like you wanna be interrupted.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.810
Right.

09:41.810 --> 09:43.770
*************

09:43.770 --> 09:45.010
Or is it?

09:45.010 --> 09:47.250
What I haven't told you is this isn't actually a phone.

09:47.250 --> 09:51.800
It's an alarm that's set to go off whenever I get dangerously relaxed.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.500
I'm sorry, I got to do a follow-up.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.140
It's okay.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.800
Oh, hey, to you want to go to a party tomorrow?

09:56.800 --> 09:58.010
What kind of party?

09:58.010 --> 09:59.160
A bark mitzvah.

09:59.160 --> 09:59.920
A what mitzvah?

09:59.920 --> 10:05.460
Yeah, it's when a jewish dog turns 13 and is required to-I'm not seriously trying to explain this.

10:05.460 --> 10:08.330
It's a party.I gotta go.I will call you later.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.470
Bye.

10:13.220 --> 10:14.570
Good morning, ms.Casey.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.020
Dr.Adams.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.210
See you at the board meeting later?

10:17.210 --> 10:20.270
Oh, you know I love a good board meeting.

10:20.270 --> 10:23.640
Now tell me, was that hank lawson you were having breakfast with just now?

10:23.640 --> 10:24.520
Do you know him?

10:24.520 --> 10:28.360
I know he had a fairly easy time borrowing our mri truck.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.360
I know you offered him the er job, which he turned down,

10:32.360 --> 10:35.240
and I know that you and i have been down this road before, jill.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.090
And which road is that, dr.Adams?

10:37.090 --> 10:40.850
One with your personal life on one side, your professional life on the other,

10:40.850 --> 10:45.180
and a very thin blurry line running down the middle.

10:45.180 --> 10:47.950
Just pick a lane, ms.Casey.

10:47.950 --> 10:50.610
It's safer that way.

10:55.250 --> 10:59.590
So why don't you just drop meat the dealership, do your follow-up call, and pickme up on your way back?

10:59.590 --> 11:02.740
Because that would deprive usof valuable bonding time.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.280
Okay.Great.Cool, what would-

11:05.280 --> 11:07.880
evan, it's because they'rein opposite directions.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.750
I was being sarcastic.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.650
Yeah, right.

11:11.650 --> 11:15.460
Yeah, well,it's hard to tell with your accent sometimes,so, uh, that's cool.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.720
Sorry.

11:20.350 --> 11:22.140
It's locked.

11:27.590 --> 11:29.010
Hello, ms.Day?

11:29.010 --> 11:31.120
Oh, yes?

11:31.120 --> 11:34.130
Hi, we're from hankmed.I'm divya katdare, and this is-

11:34.130 --> 11:36.490
evan R.Lawson, hi, cfo.Nice to meet you.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.900
Divya katdare?What are the odds?

11:38.900 --> 11:39.790
What are the odds of what?

11:39.790 --> 11:44.770
Your mother hired me to helpplan your engagement party.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.900
Your what?

11:46.900 --> 11:48.110
Evan, go wait in the car.

11:48.110 --> 11:50.250
I just got the mock-up ofthe invitation.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.150
Where is it?

11:52.150 --> 11:53.190
Ah, here we go.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.920
I'm sure you are mistaken.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.990
You're saying there are twodivya katdare's in the hamptons?

11:56.990 --> 11:58.080
Yeah, the odds of thatwould be real-

11:58.080 --> 11:59.310
evan, go wait in the car.

11:59.310 --> 12:03.230
So I'm going to gowait in the car.It's been a pleasuremeeting you, though.Bye.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.310
Look, I'm sorryif I spoke out of turn.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.960
Quite all right, it--evan!

12:07.960 --> 12:11.390
- Yeah?All right.
- Car!

12:14.650 --> 12:16.440
If you want, um,this one's extra.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.360
You can take it and decideif you like the design.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.310
Thank you, ms.Day,

12:20.310 --> 12:25.910
but I'msure whatever my mother selects will be perfectly acceptable.

12:25.910 --> 12:29.140
Now, let's listento your lungs, shall we?

12:32.260 --> 12:34.350
Antoine was asleepwhen you came.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.740
Otherwise, I would havehad you look in on him then.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.660
I thought he was just jet-laggedbut apparently he's sick too.

12:39.660 --> 12:41.230
And who exactly is antoine?

12:41.230 --> 12:43.480
He's my tunisian decorator.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.260
Oh, he's fabulous.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.770
And he's family,just like you.

12:47.770 --> 12:51.840
Antoine, meet hank,my on-call magician.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.180
How long have you felt sick?

12:53.180 --> 12:55.220
A week, perhaps.

12:55.220 --> 13:00.780
Antoine travels the world, searching for only the mostfabulous things for my houses.

13:00.780 --> 13:05.140
Coming from paris,I was seated in the last row of the business class,next to the curtain.

13:05.140 --> 13:07.270
But the germs,they do not respect the curtain.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.040
Yeah, germs are like that.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.050
Would you breathe in for me?

13:13.800 --> 13:16.180
And again?

13:17.380 --> 13:22.680
Well, I know you weren'tsearching for it, but what you've found is thisfabulous case of pneumonia that's going around.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.720
This explains why it's beenso painful when I smoke.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.980
No.No smoking, antoine.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.430
And no party tomorrow, either.Just rest.You're probablystill contagious.

13:31.430 --> 13:34.990
No smoking, no drinking,alone in bed.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.800
I am a disgrace to france.

13:37.950 --> 13:38.770
*********

13:38.770 --> 13:41.410
Can you get post traumaticstress disorder from sticker shock?

13:41.410 --> 13:42.910
Only if you can affordthe car.

13:42.910 --> 13:45.920
Otherwise, it's just calleddelusions of grandeur.

13:46.520 --> 13:51.080
Look, what you heard backthere, I want you to forget it.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.160
Understood?

13:52.160 --> 13:56.560
Um, I would, like,I really want to, except this invitationkeeps reminding me.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.520
You rifled througha patient's file, evan?

13:58.520 --> 13:59.610
No, I did not.

13:59.610 --> 14:02.340
It was sticking out of a folder that you threw in my lap,actually,

14:02.340 --> 14:05.780
and P.S., It's not rifling, if you knowwhat you're looking for.

14:05.780 --> 14:09.080
Whatever it is you thinkthat you know about me, you know nothing.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.940
Well if that was some kind ofjedi mind trick, it didn't work because I stillknow you're engaged.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.820
You couldn't possiblyunderstand my situation.

14:15.820 --> 14:18.410
Frankly, sometimes I don'tunderstand it.

14:18.410 --> 14:20.480
But please, just let it go.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.610
Why are you so clinical?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.830
Divya, it's not a "situation," it's a wedding.

14:23.830 --> 14:28.150
It's two people in love,forcing their friends to dance to we are family.

14:28.150 --> 14:34.500
You know, it's sacr-wait a minute, is thisan arranged marriage?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.030
Why?

14:36.030 --> 14:37.350
Why, because I'm indian?

14:37.350 --> 14:41.560
Wow, that's quitean unenlightened stereotype.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.600
Yes,it's a strategic marriage.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.760
I knew it.I can't believe it.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.330
Like, have you even metthis guy?

14:48.330 --> 14:51.720
Rajan bandy--bandiopad--ban--bandyopad.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.550
Bandyopadhyay.

14:53.550 --> 14:54.700
Yeah, I would've got it.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.640
Of course I've met him.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.370
Well, that's good.

14:59.370 --> 15:04.170
Oh, my god,is he buying you?

15:04.170 --> 15:05.310
Is this, like,a mail-order thing?

15:05.310 --> 15:06.710
- No!
- Oh, thank god.

15:06.710 --> 15:10.420
I grew up with him.And he is wonderful.

15:10.420 --> 15:13.650
And handsome.Smart.Successful.Kind.

15:13.650 --> 15:16.750
Do you want to marry him?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.650
You're the first personwho's asked me that.

15:20.650 --> 15:25.190
People don't usuallyask questions they don'twant the answers to.

15:28.030 --> 15:30.220
Thank you.

15:32.860 --> 15:34.350
And evan?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.040
Yeah?

15:36.040 --> 15:45.720
If you breathe a wordof this to anyone, I will find a medicallyplausible way to kill you

15:45.720 --> 15:48.730
and get away with it.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.710
Is newberg's dog 13in people years or dog years?

15:54.710 --> 16:00.460
You know, I was wonderingthe same thing till I realized,it's a dog party, and we have better thingsto think about.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.360
Hello.Can you hear me?

16:02.360 --> 16:04.930
Wherethe hell are my yarmulkes?

16:04.930 --> 16:09.520
Yarmulkes, the beanieswithout the propellers.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.280
Ms.Newberg!

16:12.770 --> 16:15.920
Shalom and, uh, mazel tov.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.120
Thank you so muchfor having us.

16:20.740 --> 16:21.800
Yes it is.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.140
It is long, trust me.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.620
Ah, hey!

16:25.620 --> 16:27.230
I believe you knowjill casey.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.760
- Hello, ms.Newberg.
- Of course.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.280
I didn't knowyou two were a couple.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.510
Well, we're--not.

16:33.510 --> 16:37.860
Well, it looks like you mighthave some things to discuss.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.250
Uh, yeah.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.590
So how's esperanza doing?

16:40.590 --> 16:42.930
Tip top, thanks to you.

16:42.930 --> 16:45.200
You saved us again.

16:46.150 --> 16:47.800
You feel a little warm.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.320
That's because I'm simmeringwith excitement.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.140
This is a big day for koufax.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.160
Yes it is.Mazel ruff.

17:07.619 --> 17:08.730
Hey, tucker.

17:08.730 --> 17:10.310
- Oh, evan.
- What's up, man?

17:10.310 --> 17:11.119
Nothing.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.319
Good to see you.You a friendof the family or something?

17:13.319 --> 17:17.430
Yeah, kind of.Fleming and koufax were inobedience class together, so-

17:17.430 --> 17:20.540
- fleming?
- Libby's dog.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.750
But fleming is his name?

17:21.750 --> 17:24.470
Yeah, it's like the guywho invented penicillin.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.069
Of course, wow.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.819
So didyou, uh, take my advice?

17:27.819 --> 17:29.970
No, man.I cannot riflethrough her stuff.

17:29.970 --> 17:36.560
Again, it's not riflingif you know what you're l-okay, dude, if you don'ttrust her enough to snoop

17:36.560 --> 17:39.870
because you think you're goingto find something bad, you don't trust her at all.

17:39.870 --> 17:44.170
Which means that the real insult would beto not go through her stuff.

17:44.170 --> 17:46.090
Hi.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.130
Here.Show some respect.

17:52.250 --> 17:57.250
How many are the thingsyou have made, o lord.

17:57.250 --> 18:03.350
The fish of the sea,the beasts of the field, the birds of the air...

18:03.350 --> 18:06.440
About before, withthe couple thing-

18:06.440 --> 18:08.290
what couple thing?

18:08.290 --> 18:10.300
The us couple thing?

18:10.300 --> 18:12.690
I thought there was nous couple thing.

18:12.690 --> 18:13.840
You're mad.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.840
Mad?No, I'm not mad.I'm just confused.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.450
It's just, do we reallyneed a label?

18:25.810 --> 18:28.400
Will the bark mitzvah boyplease come up?

18:28.400 --> 18:32.380
Yeah, I like labels.They letme know what things are.

18:46.230 --> 18:48.700
Find an ice pack.I need my bag.

18:52.510 --> 18:54.780
Breathe out.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.780
Okay,your lungs sound awful.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.920
Just like antoine'sand esperanza's did.

19:01.920 --> 19:02.840
What does that mean?

19:02.840 --> 19:05.750
It means you ought to endthis party and go to bed.

19:12.330 --> 19:16.240
These are not breath mints,are they?

19:16.240 --> 19:17.490
Sorry, dude.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.480
Um, what are you doing there,tucker?

19:19.480 --> 19:21.750
Yeah, actually,what are you doing?

19:21.750 --> 19:23.180
Are you insane?Give me that.

19:23.180 --> 19:24.650
You owe me an explanation.

19:24.650 --> 19:25.750
I think you owe mean apology.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.120
What are youdoing with birth control?

19:27.120 --> 19:28.460
What are you doinggoing through my purse?

19:28.460 --> 19:30.920
Finding birth control,for one thing.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.070
A woman's purseis sacrosanct, tucker.

19:33.070 --> 19:35.180
It's a virtual extensionof her person.

19:35.180 --> 19:36.530
How can I trust you now?

19:36.530 --> 19:38.990
Oh that's really, really funnyyou should say that, libby,

19:38.990 --> 19:40.940
because I was just wonderingthe same exact thing.

19:40.940 --> 19:45.040
Okay, so, guys, um, now thatwe've established the fact that we have trust issues-

19:45.040 --> 19:46.630
who the hell are you?

19:46.630 --> 19:50.460
I'm evan R.Lawson,cfo of hankmed.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.770
I'm going to leave you to it,so, tucker, talk later.

19:54.340 --> 19:55.980
How's ms.Newberg doing?

19:55.980 --> 20:01.100
Dehydrated,feverish, coughing, and insisting the partycontinue without her.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.090
So, can we talk about things?

20:05.090 --> 20:06.590
Okay.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.750
My job isn't like yours, hank.

20:08.750 --> 20:12.520
I deal with perception, and with a small community wherepeople might wonder

20:12.520 --> 20:15.600
if my relationship with youcould compromise my judgment.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.910
Well, does it compromiseyour judgment?

20:17.910 --> 20:20.700
- No.
- Okay, so then who careswhat people think?

20:20.700 --> 20:24.380
I know I shouldn't,but I do.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.740
My ex was a local doctor too.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.120
So he's a doctorand I'm a doctor.That doesn't make me him.

20:30.120 --> 20:35.190
But I'm the same person, making goodprofessional choices, bad personal ones,and paying the price for it,

20:35.190 --> 20:38.750
and, at some point, I may justneed to learn from my mistakes.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.730
Oh, okay, so nowwe're a mistake.

20:40.730 --> 20:47.080
No, it's a long story,and we don't have time for long stories right now.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.430
Okay,so what are you saying?

20:48.430 --> 20:54.130
For now, I'd just liketo keep us between us.

20:54.130 --> 20:56.110
Hank!

20:58.140 --> 20:59.360
What happened?

20:59.360 --> 21:01.330
She started coughingand passed out.

21:01.330 --> 21:03.860
She told me yesterdayshe's a diabetic.Where is her blood sugarequipment?

21:03.860 --> 21:06.730
Ah, on the kitchen counter.The insulin's in the fridge.

21:06.730 --> 21:07.700
I'll get it.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.660
Next to the botox.

21:09.660 --> 21:10.680
Breath's fruity.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.520
Because of fruit?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.010
No, because she's a diabeticin ketoacidosis.

21:14.010 --> 21:16.050
Help me get her up.

21:17.830 --> 21:20.900
All right, I need to getsome fluids in her.My bag.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.390
Thank you.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.390
Hold that.

21:30.470 --> 21:35.390
Whatever thisrespiratory thing is, it threw her sugars out of whackand sent her into dka.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.560
What is it, the flu?

21:36.560 --> 21:41.030
Well, I thought it waspneumonia, only ithasn't responded to antibiotics and it's movingthrough this place.

21:41.030 --> 21:44.050
Antoine, esperanza,newberg-bonnie day.

21:44.050 --> 21:44.920
Bonnie day?

21:44.920 --> 21:46.250
My party planner.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.600
Divya treated herin town yesterday.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.940
And what wasdivya's diagnosis?

21:48.940 --> 21:51.170
That I should waitin the car.

21:51.170 --> 21:56.240
I diagnosed herwith walking pneumonia, prescribed antibiotics,and advised rest and fluids.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.340
And how are you feeling?

21:57.340 --> 21:59.430
Fine, uh, what can I do?

21:59.430 --> 22:06.570
Get here quick with oxygen,a foley, a urometer, a green top tube, and plentyof ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

22:06.570 --> 22:11.400
Then hope one of them worksbecause, so far, nothing has onanyone who's had extended contactwith patient zero.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.880
And who is patient zero?

22:13.880 --> 22:16.080
So, antoine,are you feeling any better?

22:16.080 --> 22:21.470
No, ,I feel like crap.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.600
Even without my high schoolfrench, I could've translated that.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.550
When you were in paris, were you in contactwith anyone who was ill?

22:27.550 --> 22:29.310
No, it wasn't paris.

22:29.310 --> 22:31.430
It was 20 hours in the air.

22:31.430 --> 22:34.210
Why did it take you20 hours to fly to new yorkfrom france?

22:34.210 --> 22:36.500
Because I was comingfirst from china.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.940
And what were youdoing in china?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.140
Buying things.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.920
Ceramics fromguangdong, silks from hunan.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.440
Hunan?Hunan province?

22:44.440 --> 22:47.370
Oui.Filthy place.Chickenseverywhere.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.880
Does that matter?

22:49.880 --> 22:51.550
I'm afraid it might.

22:51.550 --> 22:53.380
Why won't you just admitthat you're cheating on me?

22:53.380 --> 22:54.680
Because I'm not, tucker.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.920
The only person who'sdone anything wrong here is you.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.810
I only went through your pursebecause I trusted you enough to think thatI wouldn't find anything,

23:00.810 --> 23:04.020
but I did find something, which means that you're the onewho violated my trust.

23:04.020 --> 23:08.270
That's the most twisted,asinine thing you, and possibly anyone,has ever said, tucker.

23:08.270 --> 23:09.760
I'm done, we're over.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.360
I'm out of here.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.530
What did you find out?

23:16.530 --> 23:21.360
That this thingseems to have originated with newberg's house guest after his recent trip tohunan province in china.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.460
China?

23:22.460 --> 23:24.830
So what are you thinking?Sars?Avian flu?

23:24.830 --> 23:29.610
Doubtful and I don't want tojump to any conclusions, but we can't afford to ruleanything out.

23:30.850 --> 23:32.940
Hank, I really,really need to leave.

23:32.940 --> 23:36.170
Actually, libby, I don't thinkthat's such a good idea.

23:40.340 --> 23:41.800
Okay, everyone.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.970
Please bearwith me until we can be sure that when we do leave here,

23:44.970 --> 23:47.510
we're not taking anything with us but the gift bag.

23:47.510 --> 23:52.690
So, anyone feeling sick, stay in the living room,everyone else, outside.

23:52.690 --> 23:54.670
Thank you.

23:56.570 --> 23:59.590
Shouldn't we get the criticalpatients to the icu?

23:59.590 --> 24:01.170
Well, how many free bedsdo you have?

24:01.170 --> 24:03.240
At the moment, two.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.310
No, then we're past that.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.870
You'd be boarding patientsin the er from the word go and risk infectingthe hospital.

24:07.870 --> 24:11.810
So, right now,this is the hospital.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.500
Hello.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.190
This is bridgehampton,not north korea.Why aren't you telling uswhat this is?

24:16.190 --> 24:18.300
Because we don't knowwhat it is yet.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.820
Well, I feel feverish.

24:19.820 --> 24:22.380
I feel lightheaded, I just got a chill.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.630
Oh, my god, here it comes.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.280
It's legionnaire's,isn't it, hank?Just tell me.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.580
Libby, level with me.Are you really feel sick?

24:29.580 --> 24:33.530
Okay, um, are you currentlyon any medication?

24:33.530 --> 24:35.220
Birth control.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.490
So it's unlikelyyou're pregnant.

24:36.490 --> 24:40.530
Assuming the whole immaculateconception deal was just a one-time thing,

24:40.530 --> 24:42.300
I'm going tosay, yeah, highly unlikely.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.830
Oh, okay, good.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.120
Very responsible of youand tucker.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.880
We're talking a pill,not a purity ring.

24:48.880 --> 24:49.660
I know.

24:49.660 --> 24:55.430
Uh, look,stay in the living room, rest, and let me knowif your symptoms progress.

25:06.480 --> 25:09.180
If this is worst-casescenario, we should be callingcounty health.

25:09.180 --> 25:11.150
And if it's not, that'sthe last thing we should do.

25:11.150 --> 25:14.540
They'll wrap us in red tape andlock us down for three days while they wait for the cdc.

25:14.540 --> 25:17.430
This is so not the timefor your rebellious phase.

25:17.430 --> 25:18.580
I'm not rebelling.

25:18.580 --> 25:22.550
I'm sayingwhy jump to conclusions and create panicbefore we diagnose this?

25:22.550 --> 25:24.490
You can't have it both ways,hank.

25:24.490 --> 25:29.330
You can't confine people becauseit might be serious, but not report itbecause it might not be.

25:29.330 --> 25:31.000
There is protocol.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.630
Or should I ignore itbecause it's you asking?

25:33.630 --> 25:36.110
Look, I'm not trying tocompromise your judgment.

25:36.110 --> 25:37.060
We just disagree.

25:37.060 --> 25:39.160
Yeah, this isn't awkwardpillow talk.

25:39.160 --> 25:42.160
This is a house full of people, and we have no ideawhat's threatening them.

25:42.160 --> 25:48.150
Okay, fine.Then you followyour instincts and call county, and while theymobilize, I'll follow mine.

25:48.150 --> 25:50.160
- Fine.
- Great.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.180
I'm not sureif it's viral or bacterial.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.090
Well, whatever it is, I shouldbe in there assisting you.

25:55.090 --> 25:56.600
Sorry, that's not happening.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.060
You need to keepa safe distance.

25:58.060 --> 26:00.310
Oh, okay, and do what, hank?What, stand by?

26:00.310 --> 26:02.920
I need you to getsome sputum cultures over to hamptons heritage.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.850
Fine.Will do.

26:04.850 --> 26:07.110
You're missingquite the party in there.

26:07.110 --> 26:08.570
It's totally sick.

26:08.570 --> 26:11.220
Not ina good way, obviously, but, uh, sick nonetheless.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.220
I know, distance.

26:12.220 --> 26:15.370
Believe me, I'd happily tradeplaces with you.

26:15.370 --> 26:19.260
Mm-hmm, thanks forthe medical gear, divya.Here's your sputum cultures.Don't spend themall in one place.

26:19.260 --> 26:22.150
I feel useless out here.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.760
Is that whatit's like to be you?

26:26.510 --> 26:29.280
Do you treat patientswith that bedside manner?

26:29.280 --> 26:31.170
You know, I could havea fatal disease right now.

26:31.170 --> 26:33.080
It wouldn't kill you to saysomething nice, you know.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.460
I know.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.860
But why risk it?

26:38.310 --> 26:41.780
So what exactly is thisillness we can't risk spreading?

26:41.780 --> 26:44.050
I'm notifying county healthright now to determine that.

26:44.050 --> 26:45.230
We should call the police.

26:45.230 --> 26:50.010
Who will call the hospital,who will call county health, who, as I just said,I'm notifying.

26:50.010 --> 26:53.740
I think this constitutesunlawful imprisonment, and I'm an attorney.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.380
You'rean entertainment attorney.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.680
I'm leaving.

26:56.680 --> 27:02.990
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.If youleave, you will put not only your health at risk, butpossibly the entire community.

27:02.990 --> 27:06.400
Now, do you reallywant to do that?

27:06.400 --> 27:08.270
Oh, my doctorjust texted me.

27:08.270 --> 27:09.740
He says I should beallowed to go.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.530
Are you kidding?

27:11.530 --> 27:13.570
Wait.

27:13.570 --> 27:16.040
Hello?

27:16.450 --> 27:19.500
Come on, boy.Look,I've got a job to do here.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.460
Sure the doggets the doctor.I got his assistant.

27:22.460 --> 27:25.700
Physician assistant.And she's a medicalprofessional, not a secretary.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.750
Well, whatever she is,I feel like hell.

27:28.750 --> 27:32.690
Come on, koufax,down please.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.760
Did you know koufaxis sick?

27:37.760 --> 27:39.810
I know he was.Last week.

27:39.810 --> 27:41.100
No, he is.He's hot.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.750
His breathing is labored, and--and, constricted.

27:43.750 --> 27:46.140
We took him to the vet.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.730
They said it was kennel cough.

27:47.730 --> 27:50.590
He's been taking pillssince then.He's pretty muchstopped coughing.

27:50.590 --> 27:53.190
I thought he was better.

27:53.190 --> 27:55.230
There's a dull spotright here in his chest.

27:55.230 --> 27:56.460
It's probably an empyema.

27:56.460 --> 27:58.700
- A what?
- It's an accumulation of pusin the lungs.

27:58.700 --> 28:02.620
He isn't coughingbecause it's so painful that it's forcing himto take shallow breaths.

28:02.620 --> 28:04.420
I need to see his medsright away.

28:04.420 --> 28:05.440
Stop!

28:05.440 --> 28:08.000
People, can you pleasejust give me one minute?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.280
Give us our keys,or we will sue you.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.250
Please, I have a theoryabout what this is.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.030
You do?

28:14.030 --> 28:15.500
And I think I can test it.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.470
Oh, so, uh,yeah, so don't leave.

28:18.470 --> 28:20.740
I know you're tired,I know you're frustrated.

28:20.740 --> 28:25.540
So am I, but you don't want towalk out of here if it means you risk spreadingthis to your friends,

28:25.540 --> 28:28.980
your family, your neighbors.

28:28.980 --> 28:31.710
So, what's it going to be?

28:42.770 --> 28:45.090
Try and set upa perimeter.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.940
Okay, nobody move any further.

28:48.940 --> 28:51.010
Stop right there.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.970
We're gonna have tostep on it, all right?

29:11.410 --> 29:14.660
What was that thingyou wanted me to do after I dropped offthe cultures?

29:14.660 --> 29:16.540
Keep your distance.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.990
Oh, right.

29:20.850 --> 29:22.760
Jill casey.

29:23.110 --> 29:24.230
Got it.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.740
They want us back inside.

29:25.740 --> 29:27.090
All right, let's go.Everyone,let's go back inside.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.780
Let's go.Back inside.Come on.

29:32.830 --> 29:37.760
I understand.And I'll get right back to youwith an answer.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.860
Okay, they really want to comein and join this party.

29:40.860 --> 29:45.150
If you need me to hold them off, I need you to give methis theory.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.430
Okay, here's whatI'm thinking.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.560
Koufax doesn't have kennelcough.He never did.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.650
He has the same thingthat's going around here.

29:52.650 --> 29:57.250
And, despite being onantibiotics and antivirals for about a week,he has it worse,

29:57.250 --> 30:01.250
which leads me to believe that antoine isn't ourpatient zero.

30:01.540 --> 30:03.310
Koufax is.

30:03.310 --> 30:04.810
Koufax made us sick?

30:04.810 --> 30:14.740
Yes, and, based on theseverity of the symptoms, he passed it to antoine, who passed it to esperanza,

30:14.740 --> 30:16.840
who passed it to bonnie, and then to you.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.030
Indicating an incubationperiod of around a week,

30:20.030 --> 30:23.340
explaining why today's guestsare only beginning to show symptoms.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.550
Yeah, but doesn't a doghave to bite you to get you sick?

30:25.550 --> 30:27.960
With this, coughing or lickingyour face would be enough.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.180
But what is this?

30:29.180 --> 30:32.160
That's what we're going tofind out.Ms.Newberg,I need to operate.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.300
On me?

30:33.300 --> 30:37.280
No.Believe it or not, on him.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.990
What are you saying?

30:38.990 --> 30:40.250
Shouldn't we call a vet?

30:40.250 --> 30:41.220
It's too late for that.

30:41.220 --> 30:45.980
If we're going to diagnose this and save koufax,we need to do it now.

30:48.310 --> 30:49.190
Yeah.

30:49.190 --> 30:52.110
Hank, you haven't failed meyet.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.530
Don't start now.

30:53.530 --> 30:56.720
No, no we just needa little more time.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.860
Yes.

30:57.860 --> 31:02.490
I trust his judgment, and itake full responsibility for it.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.950
Laryngoscope.

31:16.650 --> 31:18.440
Tube.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.300
Thank you.

31:22.890 --> 31:26.100
Oh, my gosh.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.670
Patient intubated.

31:27.670 --> 31:29.630
Scissors.

31:29.630 --> 31:31.700
Okay, baggie.

31:34.940 --> 31:35.900
We're going to needa microscope.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.140
Do we have a microscopein the trunk?

31:37.140 --> 31:38.290
Why would wehave a microscope?

31:38.290 --> 31:39.760
For situations like this.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.990
There's never beena situation like this.

31:41.990 --> 31:43.240
How about your palsin the driveway?

31:43.240 --> 31:45.430
They're here to evacuate,not evaluate.

31:45.430 --> 31:48.370
Okay, I'll figuresomething out.

31:48.370 --> 31:51.990
All right.Betadine.

31:56.070 --> 32:01.100
All right, once we drainthe empyema, we should be able to culture and diagnose thisthing.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.710
Lidocaine.

32:02.710 --> 32:04.900
What's going to happento koufax?

32:04.900 --> 32:07.590
He's going to feela lot better.

32:10.830 --> 32:13.240
Scalpel.

32:14.070 --> 32:15.550
Don't worry.

32:15.550 --> 32:19.790
When I was in med school,my first patient was a dog.

32:23.180 --> 32:25.320
Oh, yeah.

32:26.610 --> 32:28.510
Okay.

32:28.870 --> 32:32.120
Inserting tube.

32:38.770 --> 32:41.450
Good boy, koufax.

32:41.450 --> 32:44.870
Very good boy.

32:44.870 --> 32:48.790
Okay, now if we could just seethis stuff up close.

32:52.140 --> 32:55.330
Can you guys give me a handwith something?

32:55.330 --> 32:58.490
I am not doing anythingwith him.

33:00.810 --> 33:04.710
All these diamonds, she musthave dozens of jeweler's loupes.

33:06.870 --> 33:11.340
Yeah, look, you should know that tucker only went throughyour purse because of my advice.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.950
I don't believe you.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.080
Why not?

33:16.080 --> 33:17.790
Because tucker is smart.

33:17.790 --> 33:21.910
Why would he go to you, a not-smart person,for bad advice?

33:21.910 --> 33:25.340
So, because he's smart, hecould give himself bad advice?

33:25.340 --> 33:27.560
Guess you're right.

33:27.750 --> 33:32.140
Okay,so why would you tell him to go through my purseand why would he do it?

33:32.140 --> 33:36.420
Because, I don'tcare how smart a guy is, when it comes to women,

33:36.420 --> 33:38.960
every one of is or has been a moron.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.870
So you could break up withtucker if you want and move on to the next guy,

33:41.870 --> 33:45.320
but eventually that guy's going to dosomething stupid too.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.970
It's how were built.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.510
Bingo.

34:11.580 --> 34:15.000
Okay, here, hold thisunder the plate.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.320
Perfect.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.659
All right, good news.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.080
It isn't viral.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.260
It's bacterial.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.710
Which meansit isn't sars or avian flu.

34:25.710 --> 34:27.750
So why isn't itresponding to antibiotics?

34:27.750 --> 34:28.960
Well, that's the bad news.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.989
It's methicillin-resistantstaphylococcus aureus.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.389
Staffalo cockalus?

34:33.389 --> 34:35.010
I'm not a doctor, guys.

34:35.010 --> 34:36.780
What does that mean?

34:36.780 --> 34:40.960
Mrsa.It's a staph infection that doesn'trespond to most antibiotics.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.710
Except vancomycin.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.670
Which we should havein the truck.

34:44.670 --> 34:46.449
Which we dohave in the truck.

34:46.449 --> 34:49.340
Good, because I don't thinkI could build that.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.380
You're going to be fine.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.330
All right, you can take over.

34:52.330 --> 34:54.469
Go right down there.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.469
So, thank youfor a lovely party.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.820
And thank you for saving me.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.210
And koufax.

35:01.210 --> 35:03.440
He's a little man now.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.450
This experience is changingme, hank.Mark my words.

35:06.450 --> 35:11.030
Sure, you going to slow down,have fewer parties, focus on what really matters.

35:11.030 --> 35:14.590
No, I'm going to fill mysocial calendar to overflowing.

35:14.590 --> 35:18.810
If a disease like thiscan take you in ten minutes, you've got to make haywhile the sun shines.

35:18.810 --> 35:21.260
Yep, you are just as stubbornas this one over here.

35:21.260 --> 35:22.660
Esperanza?What do you mean?

35:22.660 --> 35:25.440
Well, I told her yesterdayto go to bed, but she insisted on workingthe party

35:25.440 --> 35:27.360
because shedidn't want to let you down.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.490
Well, she is family.

But thank you.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.050

37:35.570 --> 37:37.750

37:37.750 --> 37:38.980
Of course.

37:38.980 --> 37:41.630

Yeah, I'm sorry I keepcomplicating your job.

38:04.040 --> 38:07.630
And look, whatever mistakesyou made before, I-

38:15.440 --> 38:18.630
you know we're surroundedby every health worker in the county, right?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.590
I'm overthe whole perception thing.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.590
You are?

38:21.590 --> 38:26.240
Yeah, I'd rather take the heatfor being with the right guy than play by the bookwith the wrong one.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.530
Right guy, wrong guy.

38:27.530 --> 38:30.250
I mean,do we really need labels?

38:30.250 --> 38:32.300
So how does pizzaand a shower sound?

38:32.300 --> 38:35.180
Like the crustwould get soggy.

38:52.040 --> 38:57.010
So, is now a good timefor a long story?

39:00.890 --> 39:04.520
His name is charlie, and heworked at hamptons heritage.

39:04.520 --> 39:13.240
It cost me my marriage,it almost cost me my job, and it was just one of the many,many things wrong between us.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.400
Did you guys ever disagreeon how to quarantine a party?

39:16.400 --> 39:18.140
No, I can't say we did.

39:18.140 --> 39:19.570
So we got that going for us.

39:19.570 --> 39:22.310
- We do.
- Which is nice.

39:24.510 --> 39:28.020
Why do you think you neverhad a rebellious phase?

39:28.020 --> 39:29.760
I just never saw the point.

39:29.760 --> 39:33.430
You know, guys piercing stuff, smoking stuff, stealing stuff.

39:33.430 --> 39:35.860
It just seemed likea lot of posing to me.

39:35.860 --> 39:38.190
Probably was.

39:38.510 --> 39:48.390
But what I'm talking about is,doing what you believe in, even though everyone around youthinks you're crazy.

39:49.610 --> 39:52.900
Maybe this ismy rebellious phase.

39:55.610 --> 39:59.480
