WEBVTT

00:35.368 --> 00:36.703
Somebody help!

00:36.786 --> 00:38.288
I need some help down here!

00:41.249 --> 00:42.792
-Is he still alive?
-Barely.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.878
-Did Thale do this?
-I don't know.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.671
But Murphy had a gun on him.
If he used it...

00:46.755 --> 00:48.423
-It won't matter to the crew.
-No.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.094
Level 4 alert.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.430
Please proceed to your cabin.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.557
You should get to your quarters.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.017
The L-1 is out.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.064
I've been waiting for you.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.357
What do you want?

01:48.566 --> 01:49.859
I just want to talk.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.208
What did you just do?

02:05.291 --> 02:07.168
You're not one
to piss about with, are you?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.336
What did you see?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.131
Let's just say you're way more interesting
than I imagined.

02:14.926 --> 02:15.927
Get out of my room.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.011
You know the ship.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.889
You tell me how to get to the domes
without being seen, and I'll be gone.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.272
The Maglev tunnels.
There are no cameras there.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.858
You can climb up to the domes.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.196
Oh, and...

02:36.322 --> 02:38.199
Don't tell anybody
that you saw me, will you?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.619
And I won't tell anybody what I saw.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.761
He's stable.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.015
Lucky, you got him up here when you did.
It probably saved his life.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.309
-Can I talk to him?
-No.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.227
We had to put Murphy in a coma...

03:07.103 --> 03:07.979
to control the pain.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.982
They're going to tear Thale apart.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.611
Is this the work of your telepath?

03:15.570 --> 03:16.404
No.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.365
And I'd strongly encourage you
not to feed into that hysteria.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.284
Thale is not capable of doing this.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.661
There are quite a lot of things you say
he's not capable of,

03:23.745 --> 03:25.121
yet they seem to keep happening.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.123
Mechanical malfunctions,
nothing to do with Thale.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.918
Are you trying to deny the danger
your L-1 presents on my ship?

03:30.001 --> 03:33.171
No, of course not. That's why we have him
isolated and under suppression.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.091
Someone on your crew set him free.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.885
That's who we should be hunting for.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.557
Look, we can bring Thale in safely.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.809
-He trusts Agatha more than anyone.
-Then what?

03:47.268 --> 03:49.395
I agreed to transport you to the Volcryn.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.315
I can't do that with my crew
fearing for their lives.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.069
The L-1 is a complication I can't afford.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.033
That doesn't sound good.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.077
I need you to find Lommie.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.662
We're going to need her.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.259
Thale?

05:17.108 --> 05:18.109
Thale?

05:54.145 --> 05:54.979
Thale.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.280
He was in my head.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.074
It's okay. He didn't mean to hurt you.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.450
He's just scared, that's why.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.743
He knows the way.

06:09.869 --> 06:10.787
It's okay.

06:11.829 --> 06:12.705
It's okay.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.430
Admit.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.270
I was worried.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.439
Where did you go?

07:22.233 --> 07:23.151
What happened to you?

07:26.696 --> 07:27.780
There was um...

07:29.115 --> 07:30.616
There was something...

07:31.451 --> 07:32.285
in there.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.327
In where?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.121
In the computer?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.709
At first, I thought it was a firewall.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.796
But then, I could feel it around me.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.757
Hate and rage.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.510
It wanted me dead.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.887
Hey.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.096
Hey.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.514
Hey.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.057
Come here.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.065
We'll keep each other safe.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.570
Jesus, Lommie, you're bleeding.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.574
Let me see.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.667
You did this?

08:23.669 --> 08:24.754
You can't.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.464
You're on a team, Lommie.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.424
We are relying on you.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.344
And you can rely on us. Do you understand?

08:31.427 --> 08:33.387
-You're the one who doesn't understand.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.330
What's wrong?

09:02.875 --> 09:03.709
Nothing.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.338
-Jesus!
-Keep his head elevated.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.549
-What happened to him?
-A temporary side effect

09:09.632 --> 09:11.717
of telepathic energy,
minor hemorrhaging in the sclera.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.469
-That thing attacked him.
-He's not a thing!

09:14.178 --> 09:16.389
And no, if Thale wanted this man dead,
he'd be dead.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.225
He's got to be in one of the domes.
Get Doryen and his men up there.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.229
Was it Thale?

09:26.482 --> 09:29.151
I know how this looks,
but he's showing restraint, Karl.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.738
Yeah, I don't think anybody here
is going to appreciate that nuance.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.823
I know where he is.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.412
Just be straightforward.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.871
Honest and direct.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.000
He's not under suppression right now,
so he'll know if you're lying.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.251
Okay.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.344
Thale?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.269
Come and talk to us.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.820
-We're here to help you.
-Sod off!

10:12.903 --> 10:14.572
You can barely help yourself.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.539
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
to keep you safe.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.249
You let them put me in a coma.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.126
Well, maybe that was the plan all along.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.670
Clear the deck for you and D'Branin.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.088
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.216
The decision to put you under...

10:35.426 --> 10:36.385
was mine.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.263
I was wrong.

10:42.933 --> 10:43.893
Look, I'm sorry.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.858
What

10:53.194 --> 10:54.945
Well, now your prize lab rat has escaped.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.656
It's not like that.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.741
I just want to protect you.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.162
One of the crew was badly burned,
and everybody thinks you did it.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.126
Did you see what happened?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.592
Look, have a look.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.469
I've got nothing to hide.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.888
Just tell me what you know.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.933
Maybe you and I can work it out
with Eris together.

11:26.018 --> 11:26.894
There he is!

11:27.478 --> 11:29.855
-I fucking knew!
-Thale, no! Don't run! Just...

11:29.939 --> 11:32.108
Don't come in here
with those weapons.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.027
-You'll force him to defend himself.
-Yeah?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.487
After what he did to Murphy?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.030
He better be ready to defend himself.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.073
That wasn't Thale.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.575
Okay. You're making a mistake.
You go after him and that boy...

11:46.914 --> 11:48.833
Necessary personnel only.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.043
Until the L-1 is contained.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.129
Sir, perhaps I could have
a word in private?

11:53.712 --> 11:54.797
Just speak freely.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.967
We have an escaped L-1 on board.
Three men are down.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.718
-Your point?
-We're a colony ship.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.970
This mission, sir.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.431
-Perhaps we should turn back?
-Out of the question.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.016
You worry
about our trajectory, Augustine.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.643
Let me worry about the mission.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.479
Thale will be apprehended within the hour.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.273
As you wish, Captain.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.576
Dude, what the fuck?
That was D'Branin you knocked out.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.202
He brought the L-1 on board, didn't he?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.912
He's responsible as far as I'm concerned.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.039
Let's split up.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.460
Jesus.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.336
Have you ever shoot
one of those things before?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.337
Only in training, sir.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.256
Well, just keep your hand steady
and squeeze.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.474
Now, quiet.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.065
I got him... I got him!

12:55.149 --> 12:56.233
Suczek's got him.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.568
Move it!

12:57.651 --> 12:58.903
Down the hill.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.448
-Over there?
-Yes!

13:04.575 --> 13:05.659
What are you doing?

13:09.747 --> 13:10.748
What the fuck?

13:12.708 --> 13:15.127
Fall back! Everyone! Out of the dome now!

13:27.932 --> 13:29.683
So, this is how it's gonna be?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.353
Clear the deck. Out. Now!

13:32.937 --> 13:33.896
I'm sorry, Karl.

13:35.064 --> 13:35.981
I had him.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.983
I could have walked Thale
back into his dome.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.236
And my crew would still be calling
for his head.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.488
He's a threat to the life
of every person on this ship.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.615
-I need him alive.
-You want him alive.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.492
"Need" is a matter of opinion.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.494
We have detected anomalies
in the waveforms

13:48.577 --> 13:51.497
recorded by the Volcryn.
The same anomalies exist in the L-1s!

13:52.039 --> 13:53.958
Thale is our best hope
at communicating with them.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.543
Given the chaos onboard of my ship,

13:55.626 --> 13:58.629
perhaps it's time for you and your team
to devise another way to communicate.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.548
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Thale is a kid.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.467
He volunteered to come out here.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.469
I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.766
I'm going to prove to you
that he's innocent.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.270
And then we'll see if you still have
the balls to murder him.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.192
What's the status in Terraform?

14:21.318 --> 14:24.154
Stand-off.
Security can't get close to the L-1.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.949
It's time to use something that can.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.207
Security already came by.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.251
No L-1s in here.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.128
Just one over-worked lab tech.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.757
We need a mobile robot
that can maneuver easily inside Terraform.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.217
The spider-bot's fully charged.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.635
Just upgraded the OS.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.971
Can you outfit it
with laser cutters?

14:49.346 --> 14:50.472
Lasers are lethal.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.099
Strictly for work outside the hull.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.101
Lethal works.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.979
Orders of Captain Eris.

15:39.855 --> 15:40.898
That's close enough.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.193
Why?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.653
What will you do to me?

15:46.862 --> 15:47.696
Whatever it takes.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.451
The colony would perceive that
as an attack and protect me.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.954
Are you going to shoot
each of them as well?

16:04.338 --> 16:05.381
Who are you?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.300
I can't hear through the bees.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.011
Well, let me help you.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.604
You have the ship in an uproar.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.773
Yeah, well, they started it, so...

16:24.650 --> 16:25.526
Sit down.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.404
Go on.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.572
You're my prisoner now, so...

16:52.928 --> 16:54.471
Daddy.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.662
-Try and catch me.
-Wait. Wait!

17:19.121 --> 17:20.664
Wait! Hey! Skye!

17:25.252 --> 17:26.170
Hi, Daddy.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.596
Do you remember
when you gave me this bracelet?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.102
Come here, Daddy.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.155
I don't know what you are,
but I will find out.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.202
You...

18:00.704 --> 18:02.289
...don't know anything.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.426
Admit.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.642
Hey.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.935
What happened to you?

18:23.018 --> 18:24.770
Courtesy of our host, Roy Eris.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.688
Oh, you want some rope?

18:27.606 --> 18:29.399
It's an organic anti-inflammatory.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.235
No, thanks. I'm more of a gin man.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.361
Suit yourself.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.165
Rowan, I don't know what's happening.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.167
This ship.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.254
Eris. The crew. Thale.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.299
The way things are going,

18:54.383 --> 18:56.385
I don't even know if we'll make it
to the Volcryn.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.805
We need to send a probe.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.723
We need to send White Rabbit.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.100
-What, now?
-Yeah, now.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.309
I don't trust Eris.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.062
Might be the closest
we ever get to the Volcryn.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.274
-You think Eris will abort the mission?
-Honestly, I don't know.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.316
I don't wanna risk it.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.359
I need you to get Mel.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.528
Bring her with you,
make all the necessary adjustments.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.904
Don't let anybody see you.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.198
We don't want to give Eris
a chance to stop us.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.076
This isn't right.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.203
This patient should not be moved
right now.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.915
-A man's life is at stake.
-Yeah. His.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.084
Is he ready?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.669
How far is too far, Karl?

19:31.420 --> 19:33.088
You're doing this for your mission.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.132
Do I really need to remind you
of the stakes?

19:36.091 --> 19:38.010
You're just denying accountability.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.219
I'm not denying anything.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.139
Look, if this ends up killing Murphy,
then I'll have to live with that.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.265
So will you.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.058
Unless that's just too much
for you, then...

19:45.142 --> 19:48.562
I didn't say that. I want Thale alive
as much as you do. More.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.072
What are you trying to do?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.668
I need to disconnect the memory suite
from the main system.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.428
I know a few tricks.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.305
Been around this ship long enough.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.349
Whose memories are you planning
on accessing here?

20:25.933 --> 20:26.767
Murphy.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.603
Do you honestly believe
the L-1 is innocent?

20:30.103 --> 20:31.313
He's part of our team.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.315
Ah...

20:34.691 --> 20:36.902
-Loyalty. I understand.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.155
-Why are you doing this?
-I'm loyal, too. My captain, my ship.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.241
I think what you're doing here
could help them both.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.077
Better move fast.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.163
The crew's working double-time
to try and deal with your L-1.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.215
We trained on probe systems
way more complex than this in the program.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.134
I did three tours around Luna.
All manual drives.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.511
That's certainly impressive.

21:03.971 --> 21:04.972
You think I'm green.

21:05.055 --> 21:09.059
Running orbiters with a group of cadets
is hardly the same as crossing the void.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.228
This bloody tray...

21:11.561 --> 21:13.230
You have to disengage the limiter.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.569
I knew that.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.117
Plan B is ready.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.202
It's beautiful.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.248
It will be even more beautiful

21:32.582 --> 21:34.751
if it sends us pictures back
of the Volcryn.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.421
Especially if we don't make it.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.826
Is the gun necessary?

22:09.578 --> 22:10.662
They have guns.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.623
But you could kill me
with your mind, right?

22:15.792 --> 22:16.877
Yeah, if I wanted to.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.213
Maybe I don't.

22:21.882 --> 22:22.758
What's your name?

22:23.383 --> 22:24.259
Thale.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.261
No family name?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.556
I was taken from my family.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.517
Hmm. Very sorry to hear that.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.313
I'm Tessia, by the way.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.690
It's nice to meet you, Thale.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.276
I know what you're doing.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.529
-Making conversation?
-No, empathizing.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.366
Agatha, she does it all the time.

22:49.576 --> 22:50.577
She's my uh...

22:51.787 --> 22:54.331
therapist or handler.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.626
I don't know what the fuck she is.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.422
Cor! If you could hear the things
they want to do to me.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.511
I think it's absolutely horrible,
the way people treat L-1s.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.929
I'm profoundly against it.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.264
Still, you can't really blame them.

23:11.681 --> 23:16.269
You know, they've been pushed down
the food chain by a new apex predator.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.063
Well...

23:18.647 --> 23:20.065
We ain't predators. We're victims.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.818
You certainly act like it.

23:24.486 --> 23:25.362
Say that again.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.784
What do you get from me, Thale?

23:34.913 --> 23:36.581
A bunch of fuzzy fucking rainbows.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.334
And behind the rainbows?

23:46.174 --> 23:47.384
Everyone's the same.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.553
Darkness and light.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.223
Maybe the problem
isn't the terrible things

23:53.306 --> 23:54.850
people send out to you,

23:56.351 --> 23:57.477
but what you let in.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.401
Easy for you to say.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.322
Ready for playback.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.241
-Come on out, we'll get started.
-Okay.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.726
It's not working.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.229
Maybe he's too out of it?

24:41.313 --> 24:42.480
Hold on.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.401
Here we go.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.029
That's Murphy in the Med Bay.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.906
Can you scan backwards?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.917
You brought an L-1 on board?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.337
His name is Thale and he's vital
to the success of our mission.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.464
He's an L-1. They're murderers.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.507
Here we go. Getting closer.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.636
You're afraid. I get it.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.554
I'm afraid too.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.766
-Record feed.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.226
'Cause our world is dying?

25:19.309 --> 25:21.895
I'm guessing that's,
that's why you're on a colony ship?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.320
Slow... Slow down.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.239
This is where they're hunting Thale.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.616
Get back to your quarters.
The L-1's somewhere on the loose.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.326
Eris needs his feeds restored.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.579
Just in case.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.289
Now, here we go.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.311
You fucking little freak.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.872
-Jesus.
-Shut it down.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.124
It was no malfunction.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.346
Want to say any last words?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.558
Safe travels, little rabbit.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.078
Are you okay?

27:03.413 --> 27:04.414
Fine.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.376
It's just...

27:08.960 --> 27:14.090
be ashamed to come out
all this way just for a probe launch.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.011
I wanted to make real contact.

27:22.557 --> 27:23.850
Then let's do that.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.527
Stop hiding.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.820
Come and talk to me.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.701
You want to experience intimacy?

27:42.619 --> 27:43.620
Truth?

27:45.705 --> 27:47.832
Excuse me

27:49.584 --> 27:50.710
That's what you told me.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.299
Well, start with D'Branin.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.219
You two are partners,

27:59.302 --> 28:01.763
you need to trust each other
if we're going to survive out here.

28:01.846 --> 28:02.847
Partners?

28:04.349 --> 28:05.642
Karl isn't my partner.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.686
-He's my passenger.
-We are not out here

28:08.770 --> 28:10.605
to take a joyride on your ship.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.568
-We are out here to find solutions.
-As am I.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.653
Then trust him.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.572
It's not just the L-1, Melantha.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.119
This mission faces a threat
you do not understand.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.414
So help me understand.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.083
I can't.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.425
You need to run your ship your way,
Karl needs to find the Volcryn his way.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.427
I tried.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.928
-Melantha.
-Go.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.775
-How much longer is this gonna take?
-Five minutes tops.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.527
As soon as I initiate the...

28:58.987 --> 29:00.029
What the hell?

29:02.574 --> 29:03.408
What is it?

29:11.416 --> 29:13.209
The domes were my mother's design.

29:14.127 --> 29:17.672
Bejeweled life glowing against
the blackness of space.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.843
They're nothing without the outer ring
to support them.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.179
A much more intricate design.

29:24.846 --> 29:25.847
My design.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.768
But all anyone sees are the domes.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.812
Thale set Murphy on fire.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.232
Not with his mind. With his hands.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.402
Bringing him was my idea.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.572
I needed him to be innocent.

29:42.655 --> 29:43.907
It doesn't matter, Karl.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.700
The real question...

29:46.910 --> 29:49.662
is how do we keep the crew
from learning what Thale did?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.918
I'll make a ship-wide announcement

29:55.001 --> 29:57.378
that a faulty comm relay caused the fire.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.715
We'll be able to return Thale safely
to his Dome.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.675
Murphy will know that's a lie.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.511
Murphy has been placed back
in a coma.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.970
Before he's brought out,

30:06.054 --> 30:09.432
I'll adjust his memory of the fire
to reflect our version of the events.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.059
Why?

30:12.101 --> 30:13.186
Why are you doing this?

30:13.853 --> 30:16.022
We both want this mission to succeed.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.274
For our own reasons.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.486
That doesn't explain all the accidents
on this ship.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.112
There's nothing to explain.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.201
An internal review
of memory footage

30:28.701 --> 30:30.370
has revealed that an electrical fire

30:30.453 --> 30:33.164
was responsible
for Chief Engineer Murphy's injuries.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.125
The L-1 will be returned to his dome.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.546
Thank you for your patience
while we resolve this matter.

30:43.424 --> 30:44.968
The crew seems to have settled.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.303
I'm relieved to put this incident
behind us.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.348
I gave D'Branin's team
a hand this morning.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.641
In the memory suite.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.226
Is that a fact?

30:53.768 --> 30:56.271
I wanted to install a mirror program
in their system

30:56.938 --> 30:59.649
to monitor the footage they extracted
from Mr. Murphy.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.152
A little insurance policy.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.948
You're quite dedicated
to their mission, sir.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.074
Yes.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.367
I am.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.121
It's still not too late.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.540
-Too late for what, Auggie?
-You're not an explorer,

31:15.623 --> 31:16.708
you're a builder.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.877
-It's what you do best.
-It's what my mother did best.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.295
Your mother was a great woman.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.463
My mother didn't care
about building colonies.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.507
She was more interested
in building her legend.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.302
I beg to differ, sir,
I think you're selling her short.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.512
Those colonies create homes for families.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.055
Enough, Auggie.

31:32.348 --> 31:34.684
It's imperative we keep order
on the Nightflyer.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.604
You can destroy that footage now.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.107
I don't know what's happening.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.734
Someone's taken control.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.072
They're re-writing the code.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.699
No one can code that fast.

31:51.993 --> 31:52.994
Turn it off.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.454
Turn it off!

31:54.746 --> 31:56.164
I can't get control back.

31:58.917 --> 31:59.792
Shit.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.354
-Wait here.
-Yes, ma'am.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.359
Thale.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.653
No one's gonna hurt you.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.534
Oh, so it seems.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.997
Interesting announcement
from the Captain, wasn't it?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.916
Yeah. Well, I promised I'd protect you.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.544
You'll still be confined to your habitat,
for your own safety.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.880
But the mission's back on track.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.049
You're going to help us talk
to the Volcryn.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.093
I'll go back to my dome,
but no more drugs.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.597
I'm an apex predator.
I need to stay sharp, don't I?

35:00.389 --> 35:01.641
-Predator?
-Yeah.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.143
Well, that's the truth, isn't it?

35:05.478 --> 35:06.896
I just gotta keep it under control.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.818
And how do you propose to do that?

35:13.277 --> 35:14.612
Sift through what I receive.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.198
Filter out the negative shit.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.789
I think I would like to go back
to my dome now.

35:38.886 --> 35:39.971
I got your message.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.516
Do you need help with something?

35:50.523 --> 35:52.817
D'Branin updated the mission
prep calendar.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.238
He needs you to confirm
the probe's trajectory.

35:59.198 --> 36:00.449
I can't go back in there.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.077
Start off slow.

36:05.788 --> 36:08.291
-Stay out of the deeper systems.
-Mel, I can't.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.542
You can.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.679
I'll be with you the whole time.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.850
You're manipulating me.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.314
Am I?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.082
What happened in here?

37:31.374 --> 37:33.376
The spider.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.795
It was alive.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.798
Where is it now, Mr. Suczek?

37:48.349 --> 37:50.685
It's been a brutal stretch
to tell you the truth, Joy.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.770
I, uh, I would've called you sooner,

37:52.853 --> 37:55.606
but every second
is a battle up here, so...

37:56.023 --> 37:57.608
-Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.820
-Are you regretting it?
-No, no, I can't afford to.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.864
Every day we get closer to contact
is a good day.

38:06.909 --> 38:07.827
Hey.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.456
Where'd you get that bracelet?

38:13.582 --> 38:15.209
-It looks familiar.
-Well, yeah.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.629
Skye gave me this.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.673
You made them together.

38:21.757 --> 38:22.717
In the backyard.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.926
Oh.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.261
-Remember?
-Right.

38:29.598 --> 38:30.433
Does it hurt?

38:33.269 --> 38:35.062
Letting pieces of our daughter
go like that?

38:39.191 --> 38:41.027
I don't know,
it just seems so sad to me.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.654
I can't feel sadness
over things I don't remember.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.281
Right.

38:45.364 --> 38:46.907
That's the whole point of the therapy.

38:49.035 --> 38:49.910
I just...

38:50.619 --> 38:52.371
I just can't help but wonder, what's left?

38:52.455 --> 38:53.789
All the good stuff.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.210
Skye was good.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.964
-Every part of her was good.
-I know.

39:03.924 --> 39:04.759
I just...

39:05.509 --> 39:07.970
couldn't go on one more day
blaming myself for...

39:09.347 --> 39:10.765
the decisions we made.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.478
She'd still be alive if we'd just...

39:21.859 --> 39:24.570
...I can't even remember
what we did wrong.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.179
Eris.

39:50.262 --> 39:52.264
The door to the Mission Lab
has been disabled.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.724
The room requires maintenance.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.518
Come on, Roy.

39:56.143 --> 39:58.479
I have a shitload of work to do.
What type of maintenance?

39:59.897 --> 40:01.232
You were right, Karl.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.900
I haven't given you the full truth.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.693
About?

40:05.361 --> 40:06.737
The chaos onboard of my ship.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.239
Malfunctions.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.408
The images of your daughter.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.159
They're all related.

40:13.661 --> 40:14.954
Related, how?

40:16.956 --> 40:19.291
I'm dealing with a force
that's trying to stop this mission.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.337
-Okay.
-I can't go into precise detail

40:23.421 --> 40:25.965
-without further compromising the safety--
-That's not good enough.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.675
Tell me what force. What do you mean?

40:27.758 --> 40:30.094
I'm sharing this with you
because I want to trust you, Karl.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.262
I gave you Thale.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.973
Please, I need this.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.894
I'll let you know
once I have the situation under control.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.874
This is Captain Roy Eris.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.710
Override unauthorized user.

41:02.793 --> 41:03.919
Deactivate.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.111
This time you've gone too far.
