00:45.685 --> 00:47.836
- Morning, Kurt.

00:47.837 --> 00:48.837
- Del.

00:49.897 --> 00:53.491
- I thought y'all weren't
moving till next week?

00:53.492 --> 00:56.183
- Yeah, well, what's the point?

00:56.184 --> 00:57.991
Unless you got some magic
beans that'll grow

00:57.992 --> 01:01.807
10 acres of cotton by
morning we're leaving.

01:01.808 --> 01:04.308
No reason for us to stay here.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.767
- I'm truly sorry
to hear about that.

01:08.768 --> 01:09.768
- Del.

01:10.627 --> 01:11.460
- Margaret.

01:11.460 --> 01:12.293
- Rufus, come on, boy.

01:12.293 --> 01:13.293
Let's go!

01:19.456 --> 01:21.556
- Rufus is pretty torn up.

01:21.557 --> 01:24.807
This is the only place
he's ever known.

01:32.797 --> 01:33.630
- I don't know.

01:33.631 --> 01:37.124
You ever feel like your
life's been cursed, Del?

01:37.125 --> 01:39.066
- Come on, Kurt,
it ain't no curse.

01:39.067 --> 01:42.031
- What is it then?

01:42.032 --> 01:44.022
We've re-soiled, replanted,

01:44.023 --> 01:46.089
sprayed everything
we know to spray.

01:46.090 --> 01:48.889
The same thing, year after year.

01:48.890 --> 01:49.890
Just dust.

01:52.621 --> 01:55.274
Marge even tried the church.

01:55.275 --> 01:56.703
Not just on Sundays neither.

01:56.704 --> 02:00.591
She said the plague
is biblical, Kurt.

02:00.592 --> 02:02.842
It might help to be humble.

02:06.161 --> 02:09.372
I'm humbled alright.

02:09.374 --> 02:10.541
I'm done, Del.

02:13.549 --> 02:17.493
At least the mayor
took it off our hands.

02:17.494 --> 02:18.583
- That right?

02:18.584 --> 02:20.046
- Yep.

02:20.047 --> 02:21.365
Gave us enough for a fresh start

02:21.366 --> 02:24.283
and helped us clear
it at the bank.

02:25.368 --> 02:27.751
I left my good moonshine in
the shed over there for him.

02:27.752 --> 02:29.511
It was the least I could do.

02:29.512 --> 02:31.929
Get you a jug if you want it.

02:33.259 --> 02:34.759
We'll see ya, Del.

- Delmore!

04:50.014 --> 04:53.023
Hey, I really do
appreciate that escort.

04:53.024 --> 04:53.857
Thank you so much.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.172
- It wasn't an
escort, Mayor Kane.

04:56.173 --> 04:59.074
I guess you knew
you were speeding.

04:59.075 --> 05:00.507
- Well, of course
I was speeding.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.676
I had to get to the
big lamppost reveal!

05:02.677 --> 05:05.102
They're gonna throw a fit if
I don't get over there, so.

05:05.103 --> 05:07.261
- Also didn't pull
over for five miles,

05:07.262 --> 05:09.667
which is another violation.

05:09.668 --> 05:12.417
- Are you serious right now?

05:12.418 --> 05:14.198
As God is my witness, Delmore,

05:14.199 --> 05:16.942
I had no idea you were
trying to pull me over.

05:16.943 --> 05:18.678
Hell, I saw you in the
rear view and I thought,

05:18.679 --> 05:21.324
look at that, Sarge is
going to the reveal.

05:21.325 --> 05:24.502
Biggest thing in town
since the bench reveal.

05:24.503 --> 05:26.170
- The law's the law.

05:29.925 --> 05:31.553
- What do you say we
take of this ticket

05:31.554 --> 05:34.721
right here between
the two of us, hmm?

05:36.578 --> 05:38.358
- Hey Mayor, are you comin'?

05:38.359 --> 05:40.192
- I'll be right there.

05:41.788 --> 05:42.788
- Sarge?

05:44.188 --> 05:45.188
- Mayor.

05:47.923 --> 05:51.590
- Well, why don't we
just call it a warning?

05:54.431 --> 05:56.022
No?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.132
Well, I have just got
to be on my way,

05:58.133 --> 06:03.046
but it has been a pleasure
doing business with you.

06:03.047 --> 06:05.779
Hey everybody!

06:05.780 --> 06:07.864
Thank you so much for
coming out today.

06:07.865 --> 06:09.027
Isn't this something else?

06:09.028 --> 06:10.835
Would you look at
that beautiful thing?

06:10.836 --> 06:12.649
I haven't seen anything
so well-constructed

06:12.650 --> 06:15.566
since the Statue of Liberty,
and that is saying something,

06:15.567 --> 06:17.059
cause that thing was
made out of copper

06:17.060 --> 06:19.146
and sent over from France.

06:44.387 --> 06:45.900
- Mornin', handsome.

06:45.901 --> 06:49.234
- Maybeleen, you are
a vision, as usual.

06:50.815 --> 06:52.536
- I'm gonna leave my
husband any second.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.733
You just say the word, Del.

06:54.734 --> 06:58.139
- You know I have to mind my
Ps and Qs so he don't fire me.

06:58.140 --> 06:58.973
- Well, the least you can do

06:58.974 --> 07:01.816
is come to dinner
on Thursday night.

07:01.817 --> 07:04.796
I'm as bored as a cat can be.

07:04.797 --> 07:07.456
- Maybeleen I'd have to get
back to you about that.

07:07.457 --> 07:09.072
- Come on, Del!

07:09.073 --> 07:13.562
Salisbury steak, gravy, and
I make real cornbread,

07:13.563 --> 07:16.027
none of that store-bought junk!

07:16.028 --> 07:17.931
- I appreciate the invite, but.

07:17.932 --> 07:20.296
- Del, we're like family!

07:20.297 --> 07:23.509
You can just drop by anytime!

07:23.510 --> 07:25.136
- How could anybody
say no to that face.

07:25.137 --> 07:26.784
- Ooh, I'm so glad to see

07:26.785 --> 07:29.285
you still got some good sense!

07:33.174 --> 07:37.013
Ah, Mayor's security
boy's over there.

07:37.014 --> 07:40.643
He's over there
flirtin' with Boozer.

07:40.644 --> 07:43.081
- You should see if the mayor
would hire you too, Boozer.

07:43.082 --> 07:44.358
- Ugh.

07:44.359 --> 07:46.464
- I get private sick benefits!

07:46.465 --> 07:47.928
The money's good.

07:47.929 --> 07:49.704
The mayor gave me a free pistol.

07:49.705 --> 07:50.538
- Mm.

07:50.539 --> 07:53.333
- The best part, check it.

07:53.334 --> 07:54.813
Kane Rock Security.

07:54.814 --> 07:56.995
It's a special unit.

07:56.996 --> 07:58.259
- Oh, yeah, the
mayor's always trying

07:58.260 --> 08:00.139
to get me to see
his special unit.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.568
- 'Cause it's a great unit!

08:01.569 --> 08:03.150
I'm telling ya!

08:03.151 --> 08:04.741
- I'll bet.
- Mhmm.

08:04.742 --> 08:05.765
- Hey Del.

08:05.766 --> 08:06.784
- Mornin'.

08:06.785 --> 08:08.423
- Mornin', Sarge.

08:08.424 --> 08:10.210
Sir, I came in early
today hopin' you'd share

08:10.211 --> 08:13.552
some of your wisdom if
that's okay with you.

08:13.553 --> 08:14.803
- That'll come.

08:15.767 --> 08:16.767
Nice hat.

08:17.785 --> 08:18.968
- Thanks, sir.

08:18.969 --> 08:20.328
The mayor gave it
to me yesterday.

08:20.329 --> 08:21.637
Said I need to wear it as a way

08:21.638 --> 08:23.744
to show our forces have merged.

08:23.745 --> 08:28.104
Kind of like, cowboys and
Indians working together.

08:28.105 --> 08:30.611
- Well, who's the cowboys
and who's the Indians?

08:30.612 --> 08:32.183
- Well, I didn't look
into it that deep,

08:32.184 --> 08:33.794
but I can ask him if you want.

08:34.969 --> 08:35.969
- Del!

08:47.025 --> 08:48.025
Really?

08:50.129 --> 08:51.462
Into the office.

09:05.658 --> 09:08.064
- He was going 72 in a 25.

09:08.065 --> 09:11.285
- Del, that man's charity
is the only thing

09:11.286 --> 09:14.005
keeping this town alive!

09:14.006 --> 09:15.972
- He ran the light too.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.928
- Have you seen that
stoplight recently?

09:18.929 --> 09:19.929
Del?

09:22.801 --> 09:24.360
- It's working again.

09:24.361 --> 09:27.528
- Did you notice the new sign?

09:28.865 --> 09:29.888
- I don't think so.

09:29.889 --> 09:33.824
- Oh, hell, you notice my ear
hair when it's too long.

09:33.825 --> 09:34.971
- The adopt-a-stoplight sign?

09:34.972 --> 09:36.027
- Yes!

09:36.028 --> 09:39.110
And who has adopted this
town's only stoplight?

09:39.111 --> 09:43.160
Who pays for it's
maintenance, it's power?

09:43.161 --> 09:44.039
- Kane Rock.

09:44.039 --> 09:44.961
- Exactly.

09:44.962 --> 09:48.214
So do you see how insane
it might be to try

09:48.215 --> 09:51.050
to ticket Mayor Kane for
runnin' the stoplight

09:51.051 --> 09:56.051
that he's paying for
in the first place.

10:06.983 --> 10:10.301
We've been runnin' a tight
ship for a long time.

10:10.302 --> 10:11.719
The town's happy.

10:13.496 --> 10:15.677
No need to start trouble here.

10:15.678 --> 10:18.813
We've got plenty
of that as it is.

10:18.814 --> 10:19.647
- I hear you, Chief.

10:19.648 --> 10:21.275
Just following the law.

10:21.276 --> 10:22.350
- Oh, hell, I know.

10:22.351 --> 10:24.934
You don't have to tell me that.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.493
Did you see Mayor Kane's
security guard this morning?

10:30.494 --> 10:33.072
Keeps saying how happy
he is to work with you.

10:33.073 --> 10:34.073
- Shanks?

10:35.139 --> 10:37.800
He needs to learn how to listen.

10:37.801 --> 10:40.738
It's the best tool
a cop can have.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.167
He's a decent security guard.

10:42.168 --> 10:45.178
- Oh, I know what
you're saying, Del.

10:45.179 --> 10:48.069
But we need Kane Rock security

10:48.070 --> 10:51.237
and the local PD to
work together now.

10:52.513 --> 10:54.096
This town is broke.

10:55.034 --> 11:00.093
We don't do this, hell, we
might both be out of a job.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.410
Now, that being
said, I've decided

11:03.411 --> 11:06.384
to give Kane Rock
Security a walkie today.

11:06.385 --> 11:07.218
- What?

11:07.219 --> 11:08.718
- Just a test run.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.155
- Well, the Abelman's
left town this mornin'.

11:32.156 --> 11:32.989
- Really?

11:32.990 --> 11:34.902
I thought they weren't
leaving until next week.

11:34.903 --> 11:35.903
- I know.

11:38.278 --> 11:39.689
- The Abelman's are the
best cotton farmers

11:39.690 --> 11:42.267
we had in this town
since I was a kid.

11:42.268 --> 11:46.774
Well, now it makes sense
why you look so down.

11:46.775 --> 11:49.982
- Well, I just hate to see
good people leaving this town.

11:49.983 --> 11:54.733
- I could have sworn they would
have outlasted everybody.

11:55.994 --> 11:57.411
Shit, I gotta go.

12:00.337 --> 12:01.170
- I got it.

12:01.171 --> 12:04.087
- I'm not gonna argue that.

12:13.247 --> 12:14.950
- Order for Joe!

12:14.951 --> 12:16.934
- He was here first, sir.

12:16.935 --> 12:17.768
- Who?

12:17.769 --> 12:19.033
- He was here before you.

12:19.034 --> 12:20.121
- Oh.
- It's okay, sir.

12:20.122 --> 12:21.190
It's alright.

12:21.191 --> 12:22.191
Go ahead.

12:22.986 --> 12:24.374
- Thanks, man.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.208
Appreciate that.

12:25.209 --> 12:26.513
Put his coffee on my tab.

12:26.514 --> 12:27.514
How much?

12:28.271 --> 12:30.870
- That'll be 5.80, sir.

12:30.871 --> 12:31.871
- One, two.

12:35.252 --> 12:36.450
Three.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.120
That's one dollar.

12:38.121 --> 12:40.286
Two, four dollars.

Five dollars.

12:47.582 --> 12:48.985
Five?

12:48.986 --> 12:49.986
- 5.80, sir.

12:54.577 --> 12:55.798
- Sir, do you have?

12:55.799 --> 12:56.632
- That'll be fine.

12:56.633 --> 12:59.425
- No, no, I wanna pay my bill.

12:59.426 --> 13:01.797
Sir, do you have a nickel?

13:01.798 --> 13:02.798

backup for a 10-38.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.173
- Shanks, take your
hand off of...

14:10.174 --> 14:12.517
- I'm gonna be 10-99,
repeat, immediate backup!

14:12.518 --> 14:13.783
- Shanks, take your
hand off the mic!

14:13.784 --> 14:15.757
- I repeat, send the
Sarge, send the Sarge.

14:15.758 --> 14:16.863
I know I'm gonna go put my...

14:16.864 --> 14:17.697
- Shanks!

14:17.697 --> 14:18.530
- But I need you to...

14:18.531 --> 14:21.613
- Shanks, take your
hand off the mic!

14:27.934 --> 14:28.934
- Hey.

14:29.721 --> 14:31.376
Hey!

14:31.377 --> 14:32.925
Hey!

14:32.926 --> 14:34.389
Hey!

14:34.390 --> 14:35.853
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:35.854 --> 14:38.032
Put that down, put that down!

14:38.033 --> 14:39.477
What are you doing out
here trespassin'?

14:39.478 --> 14:40.311
- I'm working.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.714
- No, no, no, let me
search your truck.

14:41.715 --> 14:42.773
- Man, I know my rights!

14:42.774 --> 14:44.083
I'm not doin' nothing wrong!

14:44.084 --> 14:45.543
- No, no, you got the
right to remain silent,

14:45.544 --> 14:46.377
and that's about it right now.

14:46.377 --> 14:47.210
- Oh, come on, man!

14:47.211 --> 14:48.363
That's ridiculous! - Yeah.

14:48.364 --> 14:50.775
- Let me see your search
warrant then, rent-a-cop!

14:50.776 --> 14:52.295
- Whoa, whoa, gentlemen.

14:52.296 --> 14:53.665
What's going on here?

14:53.666 --> 14:56.070
- I gotta tip said
somebody's trespassing,

14:56.071 --> 14:57.527
and look who I found over here.

14:57.528 --> 14:59.143
- I'm not trespassing, man!

14:59.144 --> 15:01.006
- Yeah, yeah, I
spot this weirdo.

15:01.007 --> 15:02.465
- Shanks.
- Oh, man.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.436
- Yeah.
- Come on, that's not cool.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.395
- This weirdo with this apparatus,
and he's spraying things!

15:07.396 --> 15:08.349
- Spraying things?

15:08.349 --> 15:09.182
- Yeah.

15:09.183 --> 15:11.154
And how do you explain
that, mister?

15:11.155 --> 15:12.610
- That's my work material, man.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.111
That's what I use.

15:15.085 --> 15:17.007
- What'd you say you do, sir?

15:17.008 --> 15:19.564
- I'm a horticulturalist.

15:19.565 --> 15:22.210
- Is he making that up?

15:22.211 --> 15:24.290
- I work with plants, guys.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.210
- Oh, so a horticalisist
works with plants.

15:26.211 --> 15:28.369
But what are you
doing in this town?

15:28.370 --> 15:31.610
- I was hired to save
your farmland, man!

15:31.611 --> 15:33.493
You got real problems
with your pH levels

15:33.494 --> 15:35.089
in soil formations.

15:35.090 --> 15:37.250
The numbers are off the charts!

15:37.251 --> 15:39.362
Sergeant, if I don't
get busy spraying,

15:39.363 --> 15:42.322
this place is gonna be
a desolated wasteland.

15:42.323 --> 15:44.210
I'm trying to save
your crops, man!

15:44.211 --> 15:46.706
And this rent-a-cop
is holding me up!

15:46.707 --> 15:48.071
- Oh, so I'm holding you up?

15:48.072 --> 15:48.905
- Yeah.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.495
- Oh, so you got
better things to do?

15:50.496 --> 15:51.329
- Yeah.

15:51.330 --> 15:53.037
- Oh, so you got more
important things

15:53.038 --> 15:54.574
to do than talkin' to us?

15:54.575 --> 15:56.181
- I definitely got
more important things

15:56.182 --> 15:58.403
to do than talking to you!

15:58.404 --> 16:01.939
Sergeant, I'm trying
to help this town.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.711
- Hey, where do you
think you're going?

16:04.712 --> 16:06.189
- Shanks.
- Hey, hey!

16:06.190 --> 16:07.023
- Shanks!
- Where do you

16:07.023 --> 16:07.856
think you're going?

16:07.856 --> 16:08.689
- Hold on, Shanks!

16:08.689 --> 16:09.522
Shanks, hold on!

16:09.523 --> 16:10.588
- Stop right there!
- Whoa!

16:10.589 --> 16:11.899
Get off me, man!

16:15.973 --> 16:16.973
Whoa!

16:26.421 --> 16:28.306
- Shanks, Shanks, are you okay?

16:28.307 --> 16:29.732
Are you alright?

16:29.733 --> 16:31.006
- Yeah, yeah.

16:31.007 --> 16:32.507
He's gettin' away!

16:46.940 --> 16:47.940
- Okay!

16:50.374 --> 16:52.791
This little tour is over now.

16:54.174 --> 16:56.535
- You guys are both crazy!

16:56.536 --> 16:58.832
I'm tellin' ya, I
didn't do nothin'!

16:58.833 --> 17:01.250
- I'm not so sure about that.

17:02.562 --> 17:06.729
Whatever's in those barrels,
we're gonna find out!

17:07.695 --> 17:10.529
My guess is the
stuff's not legal.

17:11.643 --> 17:13.767
- I was just doin' my job, man!

17:13.768 --> 17:14.643
You gotta believe me.

17:14.644 --> 17:16.806
I never seen nothin' like that!

17:16.807 --> 17:19.175
You can't arrest me if
I didn't do anything.

17:19.175 --> 17:21.974
- We'll figure all that
out down at the station.

17:21.976 --> 17:23.309
Now come on out!

17:40.066 --> 17:41.103
- Oh!

17:42.833 --> 17:43.833
Shit!

17:51.057 --> 17:52.057
Come on!

17:55.864 --> 17:58.369
- You gotta treat
things with kindness

17:58.370 --> 18:00.203
or you'll get nowhere.

18:03.395 --> 18:04.576
- You ain't even gonna
check out my leg?

18:04.577 --> 18:06.050
- Your leg's not broken!

18:06.051 --> 18:06.884
- Come on, man!

18:06.884 --> 18:07.717
Look at it!

18:07.718 --> 18:09.132
I heard it bend backwards!

18:10.445 --> 18:11.445
Hey!

18:12.295 --> 18:15.295
The mayor's benefits
better kick in.

18:17.145 --> 18:20.557
- My God, what kind of
explosive does all that?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.284
- It's hard to tell, sir.

18:22.285 --> 18:23.398
I'm gonna have to
call the crime lab.

18:23.399 --> 18:24.232
- No!

18:24.233 --> 18:26.697
Uh, best keep it local for now.

18:26.698 --> 18:29.248
Can't afford them tests anyway.

18:29.249 --> 18:31.438
Let's try to crack
the sprayer first.

18:31.439 --> 18:33.962
- Chief, the sprayer said
he didn't do anything.

18:33.963 --> 18:36.577
- Well, what would you say?

19:09.546 --> 19:10.379
- Sir.

19:10.379 --> 19:11.212
Oh, we haven't processed...

19:11.213 --> 19:15.105
- This looks worse than a
one-legged calf at a rodeo.

19:15.106 --> 19:16.083
What do you know?

19:16.084 --> 19:17.945
- All under control, Mayor.

19:17.946 --> 19:21.576
Uh, we had a scroungy lookin'
fella sprayin' things.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.650
- Sprayin' things?

19:22.651 --> 19:25.607
- Yes, your man, Shanks,
caught him trespassin',

19:25.608 --> 19:26.972
and then he started yellin'

19:26.973 --> 19:29.545
and blew up one of
these blue barrels.

19:29.546 --> 19:30.601
- Damn.

19:30.602 --> 19:33.455
Looks like I owe
Shanks a little lunch.

19:33.456 --> 19:36.039
Where is this sprayer of yours?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.677
Yeah, looks about right.

19:41.997 --> 19:45.711
Ah, what do you all think
was in these barrels, hmm?

19:45.712 --> 19:47.051
- Oh, we're not sure, sir.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.052
But we're working on it.

19:49.992 --> 19:52.917
- Alright, well you
all are the experts.

19:52.918 --> 19:55.140
So, you, uh, keep me in the loop

19:55.141 --> 19:56.286
and let me know if you
learn anything else.

19:56.287 --> 19:57.120
- Mayor.

19:57.121 --> 19:58.201
- Thank you so much
for your service.

19:58.202 --> 19:59.796
- I'm not shaking your
hand because if I squeeze

19:59.797 --> 20:01.858
too hard you'll try
to give me a ticket.

20:03.309 --> 20:07.095
The tickets, you know!

20:10.531 --> 20:12.025
- Del, take the sprayer in

20:12.026 --> 20:14.943
and see if you can
get him to talk.

20:29.308 --> 20:31.997
- What is it with you guys, man?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.654
I mean, is it my
hair, my accent?

20:34.655 --> 20:35.768
- What?

20:35.769 --> 20:36.769
No.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.762
- You just like harassing
new people in town,

20:39.763 --> 20:40.867
is that it?

20:40.868 --> 20:45.093
- Look you were trespassin',
you fled the scene,

20:45.094 --> 20:48.093
you assaulted an officer,
and you broke the law.

20:48.094 --> 20:51.591
- Law, law, you cops,
you're all the same.

20:51.592 --> 20:53.136
You probably get a big kick out

20:53.137 --> 20:55.067
of busting an
innocent guy like me,

20:55.068 --> 20:58.485
just out trying to
make an honest living.

20:59.614 --> 21:04.172
You should look at yourself
in the mirror once, man.

21:04.173 --> 21:06.877
- You might wanna stop talkin'.

21:06.878 --> 21:07.878
- Yes, sir.

21:13.003 --> 21:14.836
- The guy's cold mean.

21:28.643 --> 21:30.446
- Fertilizer does blow up.

21:30.447 --> 21:32.541
Maybe our guy's
innocent after all.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.197
Shanks was just way outta line.

21:34.198 --> 21:35.322
- Well, it doesn't
explain the fact that

21:35.323 --> 21:39.387
that liquid killed everything
it touched overnight.

21:39.388 --> 21:41.555
It wasn't fertilizer, Del.

21:42.500 --> 21:46.767
The sprayer say anything
to you on his way back?

21:46.768 --> 21:47.859
Well, maybe he will today.

21:47.860 --> 21:51.120
After a night in jail,
people seem to talk.

21:51.121 --> 21:55.204
If anybody can get him to
say anything, it's you.

22:38.906 --> 22:40.239
- Man, what now?

22:41.421 --> 22:43.988
- Got a few questions.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.721
You're Joe, right?

22:45.722 --> 22:46.722
- Yeah.

22:47.751 --> 22:49.251
- Mind if I shoot?

22:50.322 --> 22:53.050
- Why would I give you answers?

22:53.051 --> 22:55.577
You're the one who put me in
here for nothin', after all.

22:55.578 --> 22:57.205
- Nothin'?

22:57.206 --> 23:00.681
Whatever you were sprayin'
killed everything it touched.

23:00.682 --> 23:03.055
- What are you talkin' about?

23:03.056 --> 23:06.057
- Who hired you to come
down here, anyway?

23:06.058 --> 23:07.935
- I just go where
they send me, man.

23:07.936 --> 23:11.170
I've been all over workin'
with plants, helpin' people.

23:11.171 --> 23:13.372
- Well, what was
in those barrels?

23:13.373 --> 23:16.870
- I know what was supposed
to be in those barrels.

23:16.871 --> 23:18.586
But if what you're
sayin' is true,

23:18.587 --> 23:20.462
it must have been
somethin' else.

23:20.463 --> 23:21.463
- Like what?

23:22.403 --> 23:23.653
- I don't know.

23:25.525 --> 23:27.689
Maybe a paraquat.

23:27.690 --> 23:29.209
- Paraquat?

23:29.210 --> 23:31.205
- I'm not sayin' it is,
and I don't know how

23:31.206 --> 23:33.918
it would have gotten into
those barrels of fertilizer,

23:33.919 --> 23:37.752
but it would make sense
too why they exploded.

23:38.610 --> 23:39.549
- But you're the
horticulturalist,

23:39.550 --> 23:41.188
you should know what's
in those barrels.

23:41.189 --> 23:43.529
- Well, like I said, man, I
just go where they send me.

23:43.530 --> 23:46.313
I ain't tryin' to poison
anybody's plants.

23:46.314 --> 23:49.397
- Well, who supplied
those chemicals?

23:50.511 --> 23:51.998
- I don't know.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.749
You're the detective.

24:05.351 --> 24:07.785
- Hey, I think this
STC is a company

24:07.786 --> 24:09.590
called South Texas Chemical.

24:09.591 --> 24:11.091
Want to follow up?

24:12.471 --> 24:13.505
- I'll take this and
all the other evidence

24:13.506 --> 24:15.314
down to the crime lab in Hondo.

24:15.315 --> 24:16.215
I'll be back.

24:16.216 --> 24:18.363
- The chief said not
to spend any money.

24:18.364 --> 24:20.102
- The chief says
a lot of things.

24:20.103 --> 24:21.324
You should call me.

24:21.325 --> 24:22.325
Hey, Chief.

24:26.176 --> 24:27.570
- You okay?

24:27.571 --> 24:28.529
- Still have a little ringing

24:28.530 --> 24:31.058
in my ears from all
this, I guess.

24:31.059 --> 24:34.261
- Go home, you need
to get some Zs.

24:34.262 --> 24:37.091
- Well, that'd do me some good.

24:37.092 --> 24:38.530
But first, Chief, you
mind if I ask you

24:38.531 --> 24:40.363
some questions about
this sprayer case?

24:40.364 --> 24:41.500
- There's no need!

24:41.501 --> 24:44.771
The mayor just muscled a
full confession out of him.

24:44.772 --> 24:45.994
- A full confession?

24:45.995 --> 24:47.212
That's strange.

24:47.213 --> 24:48.826
- Guess he caved.

24:48.827 --> 24:52.228
Definitely a lone
sprayer situation.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.607
Acted alone, case closed.

24:54.608 --> 24:55.805
- You believe all that?

24:55.806 --> 24:56.747
- I sure do.

24:56.748 --> 24:58.914
It saves us a lot of work.

24:59.963 --> 25:01.762
- What happens to him now?

25:01.763 --> 25:05.002
- The mayor's callin' in a
federal judge on Friday

25:05.003 --> 25:07.783
instead of that perv Jennings.

25:07.784 --> 25:09.423
We ain't never switched
a judge before,

25:09.424 --> 25:11.743
but the mayor thinks a fed
judge closin' this thing

25:11.744 --> 25:15.661
out right will take away
the worry in the town.

25:16.763 --> 25:19.263
I think it's a damn fine idea.

25:20.103 --> 25:23.686
That plague has really
had it's toll on us.

25:24.712 --> 25:29.712
Well, take the day off, go
home, get yourself right,

25:29.832 --> 25:32.037
and don't forget
dinner Thursday.

25:32.038 --> 25:33.626
You promised Maybeleen.

25:33.627 --> 25:36.227
If you don't show, it's my ass.

25:36.228 --> 25:37.652
- Thank you.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.130
Dispatch, this is Delmore, over.

26:40.131 --> 26:42.295
- This is dispatch, go ahead.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.888
- The prisoner's escaped.

26:43.889 --> 26:45.355
- What now?

26:45.356 --> 26:48.106
- The sprayer ain't in his cell.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.936
- Oh no, honey.

26:49.937 --> 26:52.177
Terry moved him to Kane Rock.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.501
The town folk were
threatenin' to harm him.

26:54.502 --> 26:57.936
The sprayer's locked up tight
now in the mayor's panic room.

26:57.937 --> 27:00.693
Keep him safe until the trial.

27:00.694 --> 27:01.694
- Copy.

27:02.502 --> 27:04.419
Just checkin' in, over.

27:36.463 --> 27:37.982
- Mornin', Sarge.

27:37.983 --> 27:39.916
- Hey, Shanks.

27:39.917 --> 27:41.209
Is the mayor around?

27:41.210 --> 27:42.817
- No, he's out for the day.

27:42.818 --> 27:45.623
Said he had to get everything
ready for that big ol' trial.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.057
- Might if I have a tour?

27:47.058 --> 27:48.053
- It'd be an honor.

27:48.054 --> 27:51.227
Hell, I ain't even seen it,
only been on the driveway.

27:51.228 --> 27:53.234
But I'd have to get permission
from the mayor first,

27:53.235 --> 27:55.452
and he isn't here.

27:55.453 --> 27:57.370
I told you that, right?

27:58.623 --> 28:00.306
- Hey, how's your ankle?

28:00.307 --> 28:02.885
- Oh, you mean the leg?

28:02.886 --> 28:05.157
Well, the doc says
it's just a bruise,

28:05.158 --> 28:09.546
but I figure I'm
double-jointed or somethin'.

28:09.547 --> 28:12.816
- Hey, Shanks, if you see
anything strange around here,

28:12.817 --> 28:14.357
you'd let me know, wouldn't you?

28:14.358 --> 28:16.981
- Oh, I swear on my life, sir.

28:16.982 --> 28:18.464
- Thanks, Shanks.
- Yeah.

28:18.465 --> 28:19.896
- Have a good day.
- You too.

28:19.897 --> 28:20.897
Be careful.

30:15.528 --> 30:17.579
- Need some help?

30:17.580 --> 30:19.391
- Yes, ma'am.

30:19.392 --> 30:24.236
Could you tell me, is this
the right address here?

30:24.237 --> 30:26.654
- Yes, sir, Mission San Jose.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.681
- Are you sure?

30:29.682 --> 30:30.682
- Yes, sir.

30:32.216 --> 30:34.350
Do you need any more
help today, sir?

30:34.351 --> 30:35.192
- No, thanks, ma'am.

30:35.193 --> 30:36.640
Thank you.

30:36.641 --> 30:38.030
- You have a good day.

31:53.452 --> 31:54.927
- La Coste Police,
Officer Boozer.

31:54.928 --> 31:56.810
- Boozer, it's Del.

31:56.811 --> 31:58.031
- Where the hell are you?

31:58.032 --> 31:59.840
I'm cracking this thing
here all by myself.

31:59.841 --> 32:00.941
- What do you mean?

32:00.942 --> 32:02.415
- The Hondo lab said
the sprayer's poison

32:02.416 --> 32:04.276
was something called
paraquat, a herbicide

32:04.277 --> 32:05.741
that kills plants instantly.
- Damn.

32:05.742 --> 32:07.442
- Del, it's been banned
for over 10 years.

32:07.443 --> 32:09.262
It's definitely a poison.

32:09.263 --> 32:11.378
- Boozer, I think
someone's following me.

32:11.379 --> 32:13.337
- What the hell are
you talkin' about?

32:13.338 --> 32:14.857
- Have you seen Shanks?

32:14.858 --> 32:16.536
- Not yet, why?

32:16.537 --> 32:17.954
- Just keep tabs.

32:18.882 --> 32:19.715
- Do you want back up?

32:19.716 --> 32:21.847
I can be there in an hour tops.

32:21.848 --> 32:23.215
- No.

32:23.216 --> 32:24.688
I'll be fine.

32:24.689 --> 32:26.783
- You better be,
you hear me, Del?

32:26.784 --> 32:28.034
- I hear you.

32:28.035 --> 32:29.035
Bye.

33:03.790 --> 33:04.800
- Y'all need to hire more people

33:04.801 --> 33:06.873
if you can't handle
the rush times.

33:06.874 --> 33:08.808
I've been waitin'
in line 40 minutes.

33:08.809 --> 33:12.563
No one told me to
fill out this form.

33:12.564 --> 33:16.229
Y'all see any signage
about forms?

33:16.230 --> 33:18.217
- I'm sorry, sir, unless
you fill out this form,

33:18.218 --> 33:20.468
I can't do anything about it.

33:20.469 --> 33:22.676
- Alright, give me,
give me my stuff.

33:22.677 --> 33:24.727
- I just need you to
fill out that form.

33:24.728 --> 33:27.228
- Give me my stuff, all of it!

33:28.616 --> 33:30.751
This whole place
oughta be shut down

33:30.752 --> 33:32.037
and turned over to
somebody who knows how

33:32.038 --> 33:34.205
to run an actual business!

33:48.865 --> 33:49.752
- May I help you, sir?

33:49.753 --> 33:51.711
- Goodness, that's a
pretty green color

33:51.712 --> 33:52.657
you have on their, ma'am.

33:52.658 --> 33:55.600
It just brightens
up the whole room.

33:55.601 --> 33:56.840
- May I help you?

33:56.841 --> 33:57.801
- Yes, ma'am, I'm trying to find

33:57.802 --> 34:00.320
the address to this company.

34:00.321 --> 34:03.571
Somebody gave me the
wrong information.

34:06.116 --> 34:08.891
- Some big case, like on TV?

34:08.893 --> 34:11.774
- No ma'am, it's
for a small case.

34:11.775 --> 34:12.608
I'm about the only one

34:12.609 --> 34:15.734
that cares about it
in my little town.

34:15.735 --> 34:16.994
- And where would that be?

34:16.995 --> 34:18.495
- La Coste, Texas.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.275
- There's nothing in the system.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.833
That just means that the digital
file might have expired.

34:30.833 --> 34:31.667
- Mhmm.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.170
- Might be in handwritten notes
somewhere in the archive,

34:34.170 --> 34:35.880
but the city clerk
is in charge of that

34:35.880 --> 34:39.105
and I'd need
permission from her.

34:39.106 --> 34:40.356
- I understand.

34:41.551 --> 34:43.634
- Is there anything else?

34:45.511 --> 34:48.011
- Well, yes ma'am, there is.

34:48.012 --> 34:53.012
Since I'm here and all, could
I ask you one more thing?

34:53.242 --> 34:57.352
How do you manage to
keep this place so calm

34:57.353 --> 34:58.912
when everybody around
here's blaming you

34:58.913 --> 35:01.891
for things you can't control?

35:01.892 --> 35:03.387
I couldn't do this, ma'am.

35:03.388 --> 35:05.638
I don't know how you do it.

35:08.548 --> 35:09.819
- Let me see what I can do.

35:09.820 --> 35:11.403
- Thank you, ma'am.

35:29.782 --> 35:32.699
- So this is our
records warehouse.

35:33.748 --> 35:36.787
How is it that I can help you?

35:36.788 --> 35:40.288
- I'm looking for this
company right here.

35:41.948 --> 35:44.078
- That would be our
records of deeds.

35:44.079 --> 35:45.079
Follow me.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.161
Rebecca.

36:12.232 --> 36:15.129
Property tax books
give us information

36:15.130 --> 36:18.880
such as name, address,
the legal description,

36:19.960 --> 36:23.710
as well as information
on the property value.

36:34.922 --> 36:37.089
Rebecca, I need these too.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.309
Here it is.

37:06.430 --> 37:07.430
366.

39:09.312 --> 39:10.145
- Hola.

39:10.146 --> 39:11.395
- Hola, Senora.

39:27.854 --> 39:28.854
- Gracias.

39:41.187 --> 39:42.187
- Gracias.

40:07.540 --> 40:08.957
- Mr. Van Bibble.

40:11.420 --> 40:14.604
Sir, I'm Sergeant Delmore
from La Coste, Texas.

40:14.605 --> 40:19.188
I'd like to ask you a few
questions, if you don't mind.

40:23.090 --> 40:24.090
Sir?

40:25.487 --> 40:28.987
Are you the owner of
South Texas Chemical?

41:32.388 --> 41:33.388
- Get down!

43:04.043 --> 43:04.907
- Go for Boozer.

43:04.908 --> 43:07.500
- Boozer, I'm heading back.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.178
- Great, well, what happened?

43:09.179 --> 43:10.551
- I was just shot at.

43:10.552 --> 43:11.967
- Jesus, are you alright?

43:11.968 --> 43:14.532
- Don't tell anyone,
just watch your back.

43:14.533 --> 43:15.478
- Yeah, I copy.

43:15.479 --> 43:17.478
Where are you going now?

43:22.032 --> 43:24.586
- Maybeleen, I have
known Del for 20 years,

43:24.587 --> 43:27.157
I don't have to wear a coat
when he comes to dinner.

43:27.158 --> 43:28.456
- Oh, just put the coat on!

43:28.457 --> 43:31.332
- He has seen me in my
underwear down at the station.

43:31.333 --> 43:32.817
I don't have to wear a
coat in my own house.

43:32.818 --> 43:36.378
- You are stubborn
as an old mule!

43:36.379 --> 43:38.663
- No thanks, Terry.

43:38.664 --> 43:41.612
- You look like you need it.

43:41.613 --> 43:43.113
More for me, then.

43:45.963 --> 43:47.098
Are you hungry?

43:47.099 --> 43:48.457
- You bet.

43:48.458 --> 43:49.946
- Whatcha been doin' all day?

43:49.947 --> 43:51.951
- Just gettin' my ears
checked, like you said.

43:51.952 --> 43:53.535
- Good, good, good.

43:55.173 --> 43:56.258
Well, what's the verdict?

43:56.259 --> 43:57.092
- Come again?

43:57.093 --> 43:58.972
- 'Bout your ears?

43:58.973 --> 44:00.557
Did you find a good doctor?

44:00.558 --> 44:03.111
- Yep, best guys in San Antonio.

44:03.112 --> 44:04.917
That's where I've been all day.

44:04.918 --> 44:06.498
Ears seem to be just fine.

44:06.499 --> 44:07.497
- Good to hear that.

44:07.498 --> 44:10.576
I need you right as rain
at the trial tomorrow.

44:10.577 --> 44:13.410
- No more work talk
tonight, boys.

44:19.032 --> 44:20.115
Del, come on!

44:27.013 --> 44:28.596
Sit down, sit down.

44:35.358 --> 44:37.691
- Oh, well, let's get to it.

44:43.936 --> 44:45.610
- We thank you
Father for this food

44:45.611 --> 44:48.231
and bless it to the
nourishment of our bodies.

44:48.232 --> 44:52.964
And we thank sweet Delmore
for being here tonight,

44:52.965 --> 44:55.796
and for puttin' his life
on the line every day

44:55.797 --> 44:58.586
defending the
people of our town.

44:58.587 --> 45:00.716
And please continue
to watch over

45:00.717 --> 45:03.258
these fine men as
they protect us from

45:03.259 --> 45:05.842
any evil that may come our way.

45:07.317 --> 45:10.498
And let's all rejoice together

45:10.499 --> 45:13.031
in the service of our Lord.

45:13.032 --> 45:14.032
Amen!

45:15.072 --> 45:16.572
- Now where was I?

45:20.240 --> 45:22.030
- Hey, Chief, have
you ever heard

45:22.031 --> 45:25.364
of a outfit called
South Texas Chemical?

45:27.513 --> 45:29.707
- I said no work talk!

45:29.708 --> 45:32.037
- See what you're
missin' in a wife?

45:32.038 --> 45:33.691
- Oh, Del don't need no wife!

45:33.692 --> 45:36.211
He just plays us all.

45:36.212 --> 45:40.177
- Well, not a lot to
choose from around here.

45:40.178 --> 45:41.925
Did you ever try a service?

45:41.926 --> 45:44.017
- Terry, that's personal!

45:44.018 --> 45:45.946
- Oh, I'm just curious.

45:45.947 --> 45:47.021
That's a grown man, honey.

45:47.022 --> 45:49.765
He can have a different woman
in his house every night.

45:49.766 --> 45:50.766
- Terry!

45:52.261 --> 45:53.866
You know my
hairdresser tried one

45:53.867 --> 45:57.576
of those services
up in Johnson City.

45:57.577 --> 46:00.992
She met a man on the phone,
if you can believe that.

46:00.993 --> 46:02.781
She was married in three weeks.

46:02.782 --> 46:03.906
- Is that right?

46:03.907 --> 46:07.130
- Of course, she was divorced
in another three weeks.

46:07.131 --> 46:08.856
- Here it comes.

46:08.857 --> 46:09.857
- The reason it took that long

46:09.858 --> 46:13.689
is because they
couldn't find a lawyer.

46:13.690 --> 46:16.607
- Well, one wife
was enough for me.

46:24.321 --> 46:26.571
Hey, Chief, about tomorrow.

46:27.427 --> 46:31.525
Why are we prosecutin'
this guy so quickly?

46:31.526 --> 46:34.359
- The sprayer
confessed, why wait?

46:35.435 --> 46:38.866
- Well, this South
Texas Chemical

46:38.867 --> 46:41.450
is run by a Wallace Van Bibble.

46:42.428 --> 46:44.678
Have you ever heard of him?

46:45.742 --> 46:46.890
- No!

46:46.891 --> 46:50.245
And if I ever did I don't
think I'd forget it!

46:50.246 --> 46:52.346
Del, what are you doin' diggin'

46:52.347 --> 46:54.461
when there's nothin'
left to find!

46:54.462 --> 46:58.045
- Because I believe the
sprayer's innocent!

47:00.673 --> 47:04.325
Are you sure you have never
heard of a Wallace Van Bibble?

47:04.326 --> 47:06.384
He says he's your cousin.

47:06.385 --> 47:07.613
- Dammit, Delmore!

47:07.614 --> 47:09.447
Will you just drop it?

47:15.100 --> 47:17.411
Now I don't know exactly
what your beef is,

47:17.412 --> 47:20.571
but that sprayer's gonna
get his tomorrow good!

47:20.572 --> 47:25.572
The mayor's not an idiot, and
we best come together on this.

47:26.172 --> 47:28.832
So unless you're ready for
a permanent retirement...

47:28.833 --> 47:29.833
- Terry!

47:34.868 --> 47:36.472
You know what I forgot?

47:36.473 --> 47:37.893
The pie.

47:37.894 --> 47:41.143
Terry, honey, why don't you go
get the pie out of the oven.

47:41.144 --> 47:43.227
We don't want it to burn!

47:46.549 --> 47:49.049
- Funny coincidence, ain't it?

47:51.038 --> 47:52.368
- Terry, the pie!

48:05.740 --> 48:08.194
You know, at the office
he works for the people,

48:08.195 --> 48:11.970
but in this house, he works
for me, bless his heart.

48:14.487 --> 48:15.931
- Miss Maybeleen, if
he's hiding somethin'

48:15.932 --> 48:17.991
you gotta tell me.

48:17.992 --> 48:21.913
- Del, he would never do
nothin' to hurt this town.

48:21.914 --> 48:25.232
Hell, you have known
him for 20 years!

48:25.233 --> 48:29.900
And I thought we agreed there'd
be no work talk tonight!

48:33.857 --> 48:37.857
Well, heaven's sakes,
Terry, what are you doin'?

48:44.222 --> 48:45.910
Terry's not feelin'
well, so we're gonna

48:45.911 --> 48:47.886
just have to call it a night.

48:47.887 --> 48:50.307
- Miss Maybeleen, I really
need to speak to him.

48:50.308 --> 48:52.867
- I will fix you a plate.

48:52.868 --> 48:54.866
- No, that's okay.

48:54.867 --> 48:55.867
I'm fine.

48:56.657 --> 48:58.406
Thank you for the invite.

48:58.407 --> 49:00.141
- Now, I have told you before

49:00.142 --> 49:03.309
there ain't no need
for an invitation.

49:05.114 --> 49:09.697
Del, Terry's stressed out
over all this responsibility.

49:11.388 --> 49:15.306
I mean, he's never had a
court case like this before.

49:15.307 --> 49:17.826
I don't know what all
y'all were talkin' about,

49:17.827 --> 49:22.171
but, well, I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't say nothin'.

49:22.172 --> 49:27.172
As a gentleman, well, and as a
special personal favor to me.

49:29.703 --> 49:31.227
We're family, Del.

49:31.228 --> 49:32.478
Always will be.

50:12.543 --> 50:13.501
- Boozer!

50:13.501 --> 50:14.501
- Shit, Del!

50:15.951 --> 50:17.264
What the hell happened to you?

50:17.265 --> 50:19.949
- I think Shanks was the
one that shot at me.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.532
- Shanks?

50:21.533 --> 50:22.729
In San Antonio?

50:22.730 --> 50:24.169
- Yeah.

50:24.170 --> 50:25.558
- Del, that doesn't
make any sense.

50:25.559 --> 50:27.987
Shanks was as the diner all
day today with the mayor.

50:27.988 --> 50:29.102
- The mayor?

50:29.103 --> 50:30.331
- Yeah, you asked
me to track them.

50:30.332 --> 50:31.165
I stayed there all day.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.731
They were going over
their case for tomorrow.

50:32.732 --> 50:33.578
- Damn!

50:33.579 --> 50:34.993
- What, what is going on?

50:34.994 --> 50:36.144
- Where are they now?

50:36.145 --> 50:38.374
- I don't know, Arens?

50:38.375 --> 50:40.548
We go there, we go find out
what the hell's going on.

50:40.549 --> 50:41.703
- No, stay here!

50:41.704 --> 50:43.000
- Why?

50:43.001 --> 50:45.416
- Figure out a way to get the
sprayer outta Kane Rock.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.339
He's an innocent man.

50:47.340 --> 50:50.262
- Oh God, Del, are you sure
about this, this time?

50:50.263 --> 50:52.263
- I'd bet my life on it.

50:53.748 --> 50:54.748
- Del!

50:56.178 --> 50:58.261
Don't do anything stupid!

51:00.023 --> 51:01.023

a minute to discuss somethin'.

52:29.701 --> 52:30.701

52:57.135 --> 53:00.840

a thing like that?

53:00.841 --> 53:02.368
- You're going to
jail either way.

53:02.369 --> 53:03.202

53:03.202 --> 53:04.202
- The law.

53:04.936 --> 53:09.624
- Would you be makin' a false
accusation against your mayor?

53:09.625 --> 53:12.375
- There's nothin'
false about it.

53:15.945 --> 53:20.945
- Looks like I've got a live
wire on my town's police force.

53:21.361 --> 53:23.272
I'll have to take care
of that first thing

53:23.273 --> 53:26.789
in the mornin' before
that trial starts.

53:26.790 --> 53:30.501
Or you could just turn
in your badge right now,

53:30.502 --> 53:32.345
leave it on the bar
on your way out,

53:32.346 --> 53:34.787
and save us all a
lot of trouble.

53:34.788 --> 53:37.384
- I'll turn it in when you
rip it from my dead body.

53:37.385 --> 53:41.333
- I'd just as soon
bury you with it on.

53:41.334 --> 53:42.792
- You might wanna get some rest.

53:42.793 --> 53:45.581
You gotta long day tomorrow.

53:45.582 --> 53:48.557
- Enjoy your last day
as our town sergeant,

53:48.558 --> 53:50.118
cause you ain't got
nothin' going on...

54:16.892 --> 54:18.346
- Dispatch for Sarge,

54:18.347 --> 54:21.152
you got your ears on, over?

54:21.153 --> 54:23.367
- Go for Delmore, over.

54:23.368 --> 54:24.882
- I know the Chief's got you

54:24.883 --> 54:27.801
on traffic again, but
Boozer just called.

54:27.802 --> 54:29.557
She needs your help
over at Kane Rock

54:29.558 --> 54:31.664
taking the sprayer to court.

54:31.665 --> 54:33.917
Shanks' car won't start.

54:33.918 --> 54:35.751
- I'm on my way, over.

55:08.271 --> 55:09.510
- Sorry, Sergeant.

55:09.511 --> 55:14.094
Can't start my car on the
biggest day of my whole life.

55:15.202 --> 55:16.285
Come on, man.

55:35.740 --> 55:39.333
Thank you, sir, for
comin' to help me out.

55:39.334 --> 55:42.699
- Don't worry about it,
Shanks, you're a good man.

55:42.700 --> 55:45.882
I'm sorry we didn't
work closer together.

55:45.883 --> 55:50.716
When the chips are down, I know
you'll do the right thing.

56:22.269 --> 56:25.063
Look, I'm sorry I got you
in the middle of all this.

56:25.064 --> 56:27.730
You were right from the get-go.

56:27.731 --> 56:30.298
Someone's tryin' to frame
you, and I know who it is.

56:30.299 --> 56:31.309
- Who?

56:31.310 --> 56:32.658
- Don't worry about
that right now.

56:32.659 --> 56:33.904
I got get you away from here.

56:33.905 --> 56:34.738
- No, no, no, no.

56:34.738 --> 56:35.667
Thanks, but no.

56:35.668 --> 56:37.537
No, just, just go
to the courthouse

56:37.538 --> 56:38.940
and let's just be done
with this, please.

56:38.941 --> 56:42.253
- Look, the mayor's got everybody
in his pocket around here.

56:42.254 --> 56:43.850
It's not right!

56:43.851 --> 56:45.866
- Why are you on my
side all of a sudden?

56:45.867 --> 56:48.010
- Because I think
you're innocent!

56:48.011 --> 56:49.356
- Really?

56:49.357 --> 56:50.757
And why is that?

56:50.758 --> 56:53.522
- I was shot at in San
Antonio yesterday.

56:53.523 --> 56:55.117
- You're tellin' me
someone shot at you?

56:55.118 --> 56:56.297
Oh, great! - Yes.

56:56.298 --> 56:58.382
- How's that gonna
go for me, then?

56:58.383 --> 57:00.266
- I can protect you, and
the law will protect you.

57:00.267 --> 57:02.095
- It's the law that got
me into this mess.

57:02.096 --> 57:04.354
No thanks, just get
me to the courthouse.

57:04.355 --> 57:06.686
- Look, if they forced
a confession on you,

57:06.687 --> 57:08.135
I feel responsible.

57:08.136 --> 57:09.837
I gotta make it right.

57:09.838 --> 57:11.368
- What do you mean, right?

57:11.369 --> 57:14.036
You don't understand this world.

57:16.942 --> 57:17.886
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

57:17.887 --> 57:20.636
What are you, what
are you doin'?

57:21.569 --> 57:24.018
- You gotta help me.

57:24.019 --> 57:25.725
The mayor framed you, right?

57:25.726 --> 57:27.501
- Yeah, right!

57:27.502 --> 57:29.194
- Maybe someone's helpin' him.

57:29.195 --> 57:31.578
- It's none of my business, man.

57:31.579 --> 57:34.533
- But why would anybody wanna
poison their own town?

57:34.534 --> 57:37.333
- Look, I'm just the
plant guy, okay?

57:37.334 --> 57:40.546
Happened to be the wrong
place at the wrong time.

57:40.547 --> 57:42.066
You wanna know about
soil, I'll tell ya.

57:42.067 --> 57:44.111
Otherwise I got one
chance of gettin' out

57:44.112 --> 57:47.911
of this thing alive, and
that's takin' the plea!

57:47.912 --> 57:49.813
Guilty as charged!

57:49.814 --> 57:54.814
Now please, get me back to the
courthouse before I get shot!

57:55.987 --> 57:58.270
- You sure you wanna
do this, Joe?

57:58.271 --> 57:59.521
- Please!

58:41.411 --> 58:43.661
- Trickin' the mayor's boy.

58:44.529 --> 58:47.751
That's crossin' the line, Del.

58:47.752 --> 58:49.535
- Yeah, I know.

58:49.536 --> 58:53.700
- The mayor also told me
what you said last night.

58:53.701 --> 58:57.275
Sorry, Del, gonna
need that badge.

58:57.276 --> 58:59.120
You're fired.

58:59.121 --> 59:00.443
- Chief, that ain't right.

59:00.444 --> 59:01.937
The mayor's playin' us.

59:01.938 --> 59:02.960
I know about Van Bibble.

59:02.961 --> 59:04.279
- What are you talkin' about?

59:04.280 --> 59:05.424
You're losin' your mind!

59:05.425 --> 59:06.258
- I was shot at!

59:06.258 --> 59:07.091
- By who, me?

59:07.092 --> 59:08.152
By the mayor?

59:08.153 --> 59:10.597
You think the mayor's gonna shoot
his own damn police force?

59:10.598 --> 59:12.098
It makes no sense.

59:23.449 --> 59:24.449
Keys.

59:33.060 --> 59:36.810
- I really thought you
cared about this town.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.255
- Watch your head.

01:00:06.256 --> 01:00:07.339
- Nice party.

01:00:10.313 --> 01:00:11.166
Hello, idiot.

01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:12.621
- Shut up!

01:00:12.622 --> 01:00:14.205
- Sprayer.

01:00:19.814 --> 01:00:21.193
- Come on!

01:00:21.194 --> 01:00:22.751
Guys, back up!

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:23.742
- Shame!

01:00:23.743 --> 01:00:25.424
You oughta be ashamed
of yourself!

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:27.207
- Come on!

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:29.369
- Hey, three steps down!

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:30.896
- Sure, come on!

01:00:59.804 --> 01:01:02.434
- So Mr. Shanks,
you're tellin' me

01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:05.550
and the fine people
of La Coste here

01:01:05.551 --> 01:01:08.384
that you saw this
man trespassin'?

01:01:11.254 --> 01:01:13.754
- Yeah, yeah, it was that man.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:18.884
- Mr. Shanks, when you saw
this man trespassin',

01:01:18.885 --> 01:01:21.136
what was he doin' when
you observed him?

01:01:21.137 --> 01:01:22.637
- Sprayin' things.

01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:26.872
- Can you repeat
that one more time

01:01:26.873 --> 01:01:29.123
for the entire
courtroom to hear?

01:01:29.124 --> 01:01:30.466
- Sprayin' things.

01:01:30.467 --> 01:01:32.763
- Sprayin' things.

01:01:32.764 --> 01:01:35.123
Mr. Shanks, I'd
like you to recall

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.624
that dreadful day in question.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.690
When you were in
pursuit of this menace

01:01:43.827 --> 01:01:48.244
and finally caught up to
him, was he threatening you?

01:01:49.277 --> 01:01:51.925
- Well, to be honest, I
was more the threat.

01:01:51.926 --> 01:01:55.763
- Well, thank you for
your modesty, Mr. Shanks.

01:01:55.764 --> 01:01:57.872
But in your official
police report,

01:01:57.873 --> 01:02:01.386
you stated that this man
was evading arrest.

01:02:01.387 --> 01:02:02.321
Is that correct?

01:02:02.322 --> 01:02:03.360
- Yes, yes, sir.

01:02:03.361 --> 01:02:05.445
He, he, he fled like
a spring chicken.

01:02:05.446 --> 01:02:10.446
- Fled like a spring chicken.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:15.221
Ladies and gentlemen, those
of us in the legal profession

01:02:15.222 --> 01:02:17.555
consider that to be fleeing.

01:02:20.361 --> 01:02:23.194
- Sir, can I, can
I say something?

01:02:27.132 --> 01:02:29.357
- Of course, Mr. Shanks.

01:02:29.358 --> 01:02:31.656
- They gave me a
walkie that day,

01:02:31.657 --> 01:02:34.512
and I wanted to do
good for the Sarge,

01:02:34.513 --> 01:02:37.816
and there was a lot of
emotion and hostility.

01:02:37.817 --> 01:02:39.163
- Emotion and hostility.

01:02:39.164 --> 01:02:41.363
- I thought he had a
weapon, and it was one

01:02:41.364 --> 01:02:43.605
of those sprayer
things, and I shot,

01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:46.410
and there was an explosion.

01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:48.786
I think it was more my fault.

01:02:48.787 --> 01:02:50.085
- Thank you, Mr. Shanks.

01:02:50.086 --> 01:02:51.540
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:52.546
- You want me to
tell you about...

01:02:52.547 --> 01:02:53.630
- No, Shanks!

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.812
That'll be all for today.

01:03:02.723 --> 01:03:04.806
- You may step down, sir.

01:03:13.894 --> 01:03:16.811
- Ladies and
gentlemen, Your Honor,

01:03:18.009 --> 01:03:22.926
at this time I would like to
call to the stand the sprayer.

01:03:49.643 --> 01:03:50.772
- Hey, Shanks.

01:03:50.773 --> 01:03:51.856
- Hey, Sarge.

01:03:55.741 --> 01:03:57.071
- How's it goin' in there?

01:03:57.072 --> 01:03:58.231
- He's done.

01:03:58.232 --> 01:04:01.127
He ain't even got a
damn defense attorney.

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:02.100
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.100
- Mm.

01:04:04.888 --> 01:04:07.207
- Hey, Shanks, I'm really sorry

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:09.148
what we did to your
car this mornin'.

01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:10.453
- It's alright.

01:04:10.454 --> 01:04:11.783
It's more the
mayor's car anyway.

01:04:11.784 --> 01:04:14.151
He's been borrowin' it all week.

01:04:14.152 --> 01:04:15.600
- Why would the mayor
be borrowin' your car

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:17.322
when he's got one of his own?

01:04:17.323 --> 01:04:18.487
- He needs it to
transport things

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:20.618
to keep his vehicle clean.

01:04:20.619 --> 01:04:23.070
He's been fixing up
his new property.

01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:25.571
- Over at the Abelman's place?

01:04:27.957 --> 01:04:29.434
- I think that's the one.

01:04:29.435 --> 01:04:30.767
Hell, he's got so many farms now

01:04:30.768 --> 01:04:33.185
I get mixed up where he goes.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.857
- You mind if I borrow your car?

01:04:38.597 --> 01:04:40.397
- Just bring it
back in one piece.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.080
- Ladies in gentlemen,
in closing,

01:05:41.081 --> 01:05:43.613
I'd like to remind you
all that this is,

01:05:43.614 --> 01:05:46.749
this is about the 37 families

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.417
whose lives are gone,
destroyed by this man.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.448
And we call on the court
to punish this man

01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:59.532
to the fullest extent of
the law for trespassin'.

01:06:06.769 --> 01:06:08.102
The state rests.

01:06:19.997 --> 01:06:23.778
- Now, are there any
witnesses for the defense?

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:27.909
Sir, do you have anyone
who'll speak for you.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.327
- No, Your Honor.

01:06:30.734 --> 01:06:32.984
The defense rests its case.

01:06:36.186 --> 01:06:37.812
- Hold on!

01:06:37.813 --> 01:06:39.312
- What?

01:06:39.313 --> 01:06:40.146
What?

01:06:40.147 --> 01:06:41.345
- I'm sorry I'm late, but
I'm here for the defense.

01:06:41.346 --> 01:06:43.684
- Yeah, objection, Your Honor,

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:45.819
this man is not
allowed to be here.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.695
He's not on the witness list,

01:06:46.696 --> 01:06:49.378
and he's also an
officer of the law.

01:06:49.379 --> 01:06:51.096
- Negative, Your Honor.

01:06:51.097 --> 01:06:52.494
I used to be, but I was relieved

01:06:52.495 --> 01:06:55.340
of my duties less
than an hour ago.

01:06:55.341 --> 01:07:00.103
And I stand here as free man
in pursuit of the truth.

01:07:00.104 --> 01:07:02.021
Don't we all want that?

01:07:03.909 --> 01:07:05.242
- I'll allow it.

01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:09.498
- Alright.

01:07:09.499 --> 01:07:11.970
- Please!

01:07:11.971 --> 01:07:12.971
- Del.

01:07:26.415 --> 01:07:31.082
- Your Honor, the defense calls
Mayor Kane to the stand.

01:07:33.301 --> 01:07:34.134
- Oh!

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:35.020
- Absolutely not!

01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:36.945
You stay here.

01:07:36.946 --> 01:07:40.568
- Order!

01:08:05.205 --> 01:08:07.227
- What can I do for
you, Sergeant.

01:08:07.228 --> 01:08:08.561
I mean, Delmore.

01:08:11.199 --> 01:08:15.839
- Mayor, you've been running
this little town for how long?

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.770
- About 15 years, I believe,
but who's counting?

01:08:19.772 --> 01:08:22.267
- And you've been here
back when we're booming,

01:08:22.268 --> 01:08:24.912
and you've stayed on
and now we're broke.

01:08:24.912 --> 01:08:27.959
- Well, my family settled
this land over 100 years ago,

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.279
so I'd say yes, I'm not
planning on going anywhere.

01:08:32.281 --> 01:08:34.392
- How is it that you're
staying the same,

01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:36.319
and some might even
say you're looking

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:39.140
even better, these days?

01:08:39.142 --> 01:08:42.872
- I have no idea what you're
trying to ask me, Delmore,

01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:46.635
but I do seem to recall that
it was my security guard

01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:49.640
that finally caught
that sprayer.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.970
Now, what have you been doin'
for the last 15 years?

01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:55.091
Maybe the town could have saved

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:58.286
a little money on your salary.

01:08:58.287 --> 01:09:00.520
- Well then, how is it that you

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.337
can afford all those charities?

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.651
- Oh, objection!

01:09:03.652 --> 01:09:05.376
Uh, Your Honor, they're
makin' a mockery

01:09:05.377 --> 01:09:06.840
of your courtroom at this point.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.214
This is completely irrelevant.

01:09:08.215 --> 01:09:11.048
- Hold your objections,
Counselor.

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:15.803
Let's go ahead and see
this thing through, hmm?

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.613
- So, I guess it's
my success here

01:09:20.515 --> 01:09:21.916
that's on trial now, is that it?

01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:23.211
- No.

01:09:23.212 --> 01:09:24.678
Your land has the
plague too, don't it?

01:09:24.679 --> 01:09:25.564
- You know it.

01:09:25.564 --> 01:09:27.616
My farm's a bigger
bust than all y'alls.

01:09:27.617 --> 01:09:31.227
Hell, the plague started on my
land, if I recall correctly.

01:09:31.228 --> 01:09:34.438
- Well, then how is it
that you can afford

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:38.064
all these donations, and
all these charities,

01:09:38.064 --> 01:09:40.984
and sacrifices on our behalf?

01:09:40.986 --> 01:09:43.723
- Now you all know that
my family was blessed

01:09:43.724 --> 01:09:47.563
with a couple of very
productive wells up in Midland.

01:09:47.564 --> 01:09:51.533
Now I'm more than happy to be
generous any way that I can.

01:09:51.533 --> 01:09:53.453
That's the Edward Kane way.

01:09:53.453 --> 01:09:57.537
Generosity and charity,
in good times and in bad.

01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:03.006
- Edward Kane's
your father, right?

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:07.163
- It's my name too, Delmore.

01:10:07.164 --> 01:10:09.331
- Of course it is, Junior.

01:10:12.049 --> 01:10:14.882
He just didn't
bankrupt this town.

01:10:19.364 --> 01:10:23.744
- Now look, I feel real
bad for all these folks.

01:10:23.745 --> 01:10:27.078
That's why I've been
buying their farms.

01:10:27.985 --> 01:10:30.568
- You just bought the
Abelman's place too, right?

01:10:30.569 --> 01:10:31.465
- Yes, I did.

01:10:31.466 --> 01:10:34.386
Fine family, sorry
to see 'em go.

01:10:34.387 --> 01:10:37.220
Look, folks, I pay
very generously

01:10:38.854 --> 01:10:41.557
for all the farms that I buy.

01:10:41.558 --> 01:10:44.568
Farmland that's got
the plague, alright?

01:10:44.569 --> 01:10:46.146
So it's worthless.

01:10:46.147 --> 01:10:48.328
Hell, it's worth
less than nothin'.

01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:52.397
You add it all up, it's
a, it's a net loss.

01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:53.837
So that's just some more
charity right there

01:10:53.838 --> 01:10:57.134
from me to the town,
free of charge.

01:10:57.135 --> 01:10:59.968
- Unless there's no plague now.

01:10:59.969 --> 01:11:03.431
- Judge, if this man's got
no serious questions for me,

01:11:03.432 --> 01:11:05.829
I'm just gonna excuse
myself right now

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.149
so we can hang this
son of a bitch.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:09.150
- Uh.

01:11:29.179 --> 01:11:34.179
- I have a piece of the barrel
from the sprayer's explosion.

01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:36.978
And I just left the
Abelman's farm,

01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:39.096
which you know the
mayor now owns,

01:11:39.097 --> 01:11:41.498
and I saw plenty of
barrels just like it

01:11:41.499 --> 01:11:43.293
that weren't there before.

01:11:43.294 --> 01:11:46.544
- Well, who's trespassin'
now, Delmore?

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:52.357
- I also have from the
records down in San Antonio

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:59.094
a deed from a company named
South Texas Chemical,

01:12:01.458 --> 01:12:04.958
where I found the same
barrels and poison.

01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:14.960
I believe a man named
Wallace Van Bibble

01:12:14.961 --> 01:12:17.461
was hired to fix our farmland.

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:22.280
But the mayor and Mr. Van Bibble

01:12:22.281 --> 01:12:24.864
swapped the barrels for poison,

01:12:27.493 --> 01:12:30.450
and then hired this
man right here

01:12:30.451 --> 01:12:33.085
and framed him for
the whole thing.

01:12:33.086 --> 01:12:35.086
This is an innocent man.

01:12:36.441 --> 01:12:39.358
Mayor Kane has
killed our farmland,

01:12:41.339 --> 01:12:43.760
and if you wanna find
out just follow me

01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:46.983
down to the Abelman
farm and I'll prove it.

01:12:46.984 --> 01:12:47.817
- Oh, come on!

01:12:47.818 --> 01:12:50.627
- Okay, this is not a
field trip, Your Honor!

01:12:51.507 --> 01:12:52.438
- Order!
- Hush!

01:12:52.439 --> 01:12:55.855
- Order!

01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:01.203
Why don't we go and
see if those barrels

01:13:01.204 --> 01:13:05.204
are truly there the way
you claim they are, hmm?

01:13:09.438 --> 01:13:10.271
- Don't you!

01:13:10.271 --> 01:13:11.104
Del!

01:13:11.104 --> 01:13:11.937
- Whoa!

01:13:11.938 --> 01:13:13.769
Oh, sweet Jesus!

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:15.012
- Help!

01:13:17.473 --> 01:13:19.886
- Lord, help us!

01:13:19.887 --> 01:13:23.335
- You just killed
this town, you idiot.

01:13:24.916 --> 01:13:26.278
My family made this town.

01:13:26.279 --> 01:13:29.339
I own you, I own
everybody in this room.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:33.469
Let's just see how well you all
do without me around, huh?

01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:34.470
- It's okay.

01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:38.184
- Oh no, what'd I do?

01:13:38.185 --> 01:13:39.264
What did I do?

01:13:39.265 --> 01:13:40.515
Oh, no! - Shit.

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:42.813
- Get!

01:13:42.813 --> 01:13:43.813
- Oh no!

01:13:46.116 --> 01:13:49.715
- It's been real swell
being your mayor.

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:51.755
- Help, help me!

01:13:51.756 --> 01:13:52.589
- Chief.

01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.216
- I didn't know, Delmore.

01:13:54.217 --> 01:13:55.302
I swear.

01:13:55.303 --> 01:13:56.677
Oh.

01:13:56.678 --> 01:13:58.715
- Call somebody!

01:13:58.716 --> 01:14:00.179
- Go get that bastard!

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.013
- Go, I got him!

01:14:01.014 --> 01:14:04.232
- Del, let's go!

01:14:07.202 --> 01:14:08.035
- Whoa!

01:14:08.036 --> 01:14:09.517
- There's an innocent
man in there!

01:14:09.518 --> 01:14:10.351
- Well, what can I do?

01:14:10.352 --> 01:14:11.632
- Take Chief to the hospital.

01:14:11.633 --> 01:14:12.466
- On it!

01:14:12.466 --> 01:14:13.466
- Let's go!

01:14:52.527 --> 01:14:54.407
- Shanks, we need backup
at the old circle maze.

01:14:57.112 --> 01:14:58.112
- Ready?

01:15:53.803 --> 01:15:54.803
- Oh, shit!

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.153
- No, no!

01:16:29.816 --> 01:16:31.399
- Not another step!

01:16:32.308 --> 01:16:33.641
Drop the weapon.

01:16:39.457 --> 01:16:40.457
Now!

01:16:44.668 --> 01:16:48.448
You just couldn't let things
go, could you Delmore?

01:16:48.449 --> 01:16:50.878
- This is just between
you and me, really.

01:16:50.879 --> 01:16:52.158
Now let 'em go!

01:16:52.159 --> 01:16:54.597
- Let 'em go?

01:16:54.598 --> 01:16:56.259
Why would I do that?

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.466
Are you that stupid?

01:16:58.467 --> 01:17:01.384
None of y'all are
going anywhere.

01:17:01.385 --> 01:17:06.344
See, I got what some folks
like to call a lifeline.

01:17:06.345 --> 01:17:10.305
Anything happens to you two,
I got this idiot right here.

01:17:12.447 --> 01:17:15.606
You see, now all I've gotta
do is take his cuffs off

01:17:15.607 --> 01:17:19.896
after I shoot you two, and I
can frame him for everything.

01:17:19.897 --> 01:17:21.875
Hell, the people of this town

01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:22.772
are dumber than dirt.

01:17:22.773 --> 01:17:24.736
They'll believe anything I say.

01:17:24.737 --> 01:17:26.736
- No, they know the truth.

01:17:26.737 --> 01:17:29.995
- The truth is what I say it is!

01:17:29.996 --> 01:17:32.383
- So you're just gonna go
back to the way it was?

01:17:32.384 --> 01:17:35.229
Hire another Joe,
another Van Bibble,

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:36.761
and keep gettin' richer?

01:17:36.762 --> 01:17:38.464
- I don't know!

01:17:38.465 --> 01:17:40.225
Hell, I hadn't thought
it through that much!

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:48.776
And it if hadn't been
for this idiot here,

01:17:48.777 --> 01:17:50.536
neither one of y'all
would have had to die!

01:17:50.537 --> 01:17:51.537
- No!

01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:01.042
- You asshole!

01:18:01.898 --> 01:18:03.913
Shanks!

01:18:03.914 --> 01:18:07.657
- I've been waitin' a
long time for this.

01:18:07.658 --> 01:18:08.658
- Hey!

01:18:18.506 --> 01:18:19.339
- Shanks?

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.588
- Yeah, yeah, I'm alright.

01:18:26.697 --> 01:18:28.608
- What the fuck was that?

01:18:28.609 --> 01:18:30.334
- It looks bad.

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:33.329
- Just get me outta here, Del.

01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:34.830
Get me outta here!

01:18:38.097 --> 01:18:39.680
- I need your help.

01:18:43.348 --> 01:18:44.348
- Hey.

01:18:45.227 --> 01:18:47.085
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:18:47.086 --> 01:18:48.753
- There's Maybeleen.

01:18:51.283 --> 01:18:52.537
Hey, this is fun.

01:18:52.538 --> 01:18:53.765
- Are you okay?

01:18:53.766 --> 01:18:54.766
- Yeah.

01:18:57.211 --> 01:18:58.264
How's the chief?

01:18:58.265 --> 01:18:59.845
- Oh, he's, he's fine.

01:18:59.846 --> 01:19:02.442
He just had a little excitement.

01:19:02.443 --> 01:19:03.334
Oh my God!

01:19:03.334 --> 01:19:04.334
- Move over.

01:19:05.279 --> 01:19:06.963
- It's alright, it's okay.

01:19:06.964 --> 01:19:09.147
- Del, what about the mayor?

01:19:09.148 --> 01:19:10.430
- He's been taken care of.

01:19:12.796 --> 01:19:15.331
- Okay, come on, let's go.

01:19:15.332 --> 01:19:16.832
- Del, be careful.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:18.851
- I'm better.

01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:20.665
- I still don't trust him.

01:19:28.274 --> 01:19:29.722
- Ready, Sergeant?

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:31.140

I just wanna go home.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:54.531
- What about all
the other charges?

01:20:55.542 --> 01:20:58.042
- There were no other charges.

01:21:02.386 --> 01:21:04.386
What are you doin', man?

01:21:06.443 --> 01:21:10.853
- I just don't want anybody
else gettin' hurt today.

01:21:10.854 --> 01:21:13.482

shoot me right here?

01:21:13.483 --> 01:21:15.117
Just let me go!

01:21:15.118 --> 01:21:18.469
- You're not fooling
me anymore, Joe.

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:23.093
A class C criminal trespassing
is a misdemeanor in Texas.

01:21:23.094 --> 01:21:26.011
It's a $500 fine,
and no jail time.

01:21:27.934 --> 01:21:30.656
I suppose you've
always known that.

01:21:30.657 --> 01:21:34.574
How much extra did he pay
you to take the fall?

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:40.016
- Man, you don't
understand nothin', do ya?

01:21:40.956 --> 01:21:42.424
- Then tell the truth.

01:21:42.425 --> 01:21:43.425
- The truth?

01:21:45.172 --> 01:21:48.611
- The truth is stupid people
believe what I tell them.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:51.301
Gives the advantage
to someone like me.

01:21:51.302 --> 01:21:53.940
- Well, that's not right.

01:21:53.941 --> 01:21:56.081
- I'm a horticulturalist, right?

01:21:59.102 --> 01:22:00.223
- You're the mayor's partner.

01:22:00.224 --> 01:22:03.941
- I'm not the mayors
anything, for sure.

01:22:03.942 --> 01:22:07.056
But I got desperate
people just like him

01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:10.614
wantin' to do land deals
with me all over the place.

01:22:10.615 --> 01:22:14.373
- You put paraquat in the
mayor's bulletproof vest.

01:22:14.374 --> 01:22:17.695
- I'm impressed, you
really are a detective.

01:22:17.696 --> 01:22:19.604
- Is your name even Joe?

01:22:23.262 --> 01:22:24.345
- Yeah, sure.

01:22:25.382 --> 01:22:29.093
To some I'm Joe, to
others I'm Terry.

01:22:29.094 --> 01:22:30.094
- Fellers.

01:22:32.073 --> 01:22:36.156
You were the one paying
the bills for Van Bibble.

01:22:37.044 --> 01:22:38.947
- Scared you last
night, didn't I?

01:22:38.948 --> 01:22:43.380
Got your monkey suit all dirty
diving in the dirt, huh?

01:22:43.381 --> 01:22:46.528
I could have shot you in
San Antonio last night,

01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:47.612
but I didn't.

01:22:48.684 --> 01:22:49.934
I chose not to!

01:22:52.353 --> 01:22:54.413
So here's what's
gonna happen now.

01:22:54.414 --> 01:22:57.813
I'm gonna get out of this
car and you and I are done.

01:22:57.814 --> 01:23:00.693
That's all I can do
for you, cowboy.

01:23:00.694 --> 01:23:01.694
- No.

01:23:02.828 --> 01:23:05.819
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:10.563
Turn yourself in and I'll
give you a fair shake.

01:23:10.564 --> 01:23:11.564
I promise.

01:23:14.753 --> 01:23:16.420
- Alright, Sergeant.

01:23:19.249 --> 01:23:21.999
I got your fair
shake right here.

01:23:23.124 --> 01:23:24.736
Hands up.

01:23:24.737 --> 01:23:26.358
- You don't wanna
go down that road.

01:23:26.359 --> 01:23:27.859
- I said hands up!

01:23:29.542 --> 01:23:30.709
Nice and easy.

01:23:33.614 --> 01:23:36.281
Now don't you go foolin' me now.

01:23:38.062 --> 01:23:40.312
- I ain't the foolin' kind.

01:23:41.302 --> 01:23:42.302
- Good.

01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:47.620
The law's the law.

01:23:49.895 --> 01:23:52.312
Where's that got ya, Delmore?

01:23:55.062 --> 01:23:57.062
Any last words, Delmore?

01:23:59.696 --> 01:24:02.493
- Mind if I turn this up?

01:24:02.494 --> 01:24:03.911
- No, not at all.
