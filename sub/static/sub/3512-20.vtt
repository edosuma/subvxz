00:21.492 --> 00:23.297
What the...

00:23.366 --> 00:27.150
Hey! Somebody call the foreman!

00:27.218 --> 00:28.996
So, breakfast... divide and conquer?

00:29.040 --> 00:30.403
I'll make the coffee.

00:30.441 --> 00:32.008
I'll make the omelettes.

00:32.061 --> 00:36.161
And <i> I</i> am going to make your day.

00:36.218 --> 00:37.444
I have the most exciting news.

00:37.483 --> 00:39.390
I just wanted to wait until
you were finished doing,

00:39.426 --> 00:41.486
- you know, whatever you were doing
in there. - Sleeping?

00:41.526 --> 00:42.581
Uh, what news?

00:42.626 --> 00:44.261
- About your wedding.
- Oh.

00:44.283 --> 00:47.043
Um, you've come up with options
for flower arrangements.

00:47.291 --> 00:50.255
I have searched high and low

00:50.310 --> 00:54.058
trying to capture the look
that is the essence of you.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.609
I give you...

00:56.649 --> 00:59.136
the tunnel of love.

00:59.157 --> 01:01.542
The bride and groom walk to the altar

01:01.572 --> 01:05.286
through the arched passageway
festooned with exotic flowers.

01:05.426 --> 01:08.664
<i>Then</i> I found <i>this.</i>

01:09.036 --> 01:11.694
Is that a giant photograph?

01:11.725 --> 01:14.417
Made entirely of flowers?

01:14.461 --> 01:16.948
Yes, except it would be,
of course, the two of you,

01:16.994 --> 01:20.157
painstakingly crafted
by skilled artisans.

01:20.223 --> 01:21.244
Just...
[Shivers]

01:21.314 --> 01:23.562
- But wait, there's more.
- Mother.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.276
As much as I appreciate your passion,

01:26.330 --> 01:28.669
and obviously, diligent research,

01:28.711 --> 01:32.254
I just think
this is... a little too much.

01:32.323 --> 01:33.937
In terms of expense?

01:34.007 --> 01:35.587
In terms of...

01:36.876 --> 01:38.715
e... everything.

01:38.785 --> 01:41.568
Richard, why do you just dismiss

01:41.638 --> 01:44.421
all of my ideas about your ceremony?

01:44.490 --> 01:47.342
You mean like your ideas of
bringing in giant ice sculptures

01:47.412 --> 01:49.232
of Nikki Heat or hiring
the Vienna boys' choir

01:49.303 --> 01:50.573
or having The Blue Angels fly overhead?

01:50.643 --> 01:51.879
Richard, I'm simply trying

01:51.949 --> 01:54.216
to bring a little pageantry
into your wedding.

01:54.286 --> 01:55.523
But...

01:55.593 --> 01:56.725
seems the only role

01:56.796 --> 01:58.341
you want me to play is that of guest.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.243
Fine. I can do that.

02:03.601 --> 02:06.592
I just asked her to check into
flowers and keep it simple.

02:06.721 --> 02:09.209
With her track record,
I... I s... should've known better.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.704
Look, she means well, Castle.

02:10.734 --> 02:12.452
She just wants to be a part of this,

02:12.482 --> 02:14.337
so let's find something for her to do...

02:14.388 --> 02:16.402
some kind of a... wedding project.

02:16.451 --> 02:17.649
Yes. You're right,

02:17.720 --> 02:20.625
but something she can't turn
into an over-the-top disaster.

02:24.238 --> 02:25.592
- I'll keep thinking.
- Yeah, me too.

02:25.644 --> 02:26.510
Esposito: Yo.

02:26.581 --> 02:27.910
So, this building
was set to be demolished.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.047
That is, until the salvage crew
stripping the place

02:30.118 --> 02:31.518
came across this body.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.433
Ryan: Buried under concrete, no less.

02:34.495 --> 02:35.597
You got a cause of death?

02:35.641 --> 02:37.863
Not till I do a full exam,
but he's probably been here

02:37.910 --> 02:40.943
since they poured the concrete
back in 1978.

02:41.015 --> 02:43.740
Castle: A dead man from
the Carter administration

02:43.779 --> 02:46.029
entombed in cement... I am intrigued.

02:46.092 --> 02:47.537
Anything else you can tell us
about the victim?

02:47.607 --> 02:50.561
Lanie: He was maybe early 30s,
and a sharp dresser.

02:50.612 --> 02:52.443
Check out that powder-blue suit.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.408
Yeah, straight from the disco era.

02:54.448 --> 02:55.295
And a testament

02:55.335 --> 02:58.290
to the truly indestructible
nature of polyester.

02:58.735 --> 03:00.418
We'll check out who owned
the building back in '78

03:00.456 --> 03:02.547
- and who owns it now.
Esposito: - We'll also pull permits,

03:02.582 --> 03:04.684
see if we can track down
who poured this concrete.

03:06.566 --> 03:08.156
[ Exaggerated gasp ]

03:08.227 --> 03:09.629
I know who the victim is.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.681
What?

03:10.752 --> 03:12.539
A man in his 30s

03:12.585 --> 03:15.776
with a penchant for pinkie rings
and Panerai watches...

03:15.830 --> 03:18.473
who mysteriously vanished in 1978.

03:18.501 --> 03:19.447
Come on!

03:20.895 --> 03:22.322
Vince Bianchi?

03:22.353 --> 03:24.411
Head of the Bianchi crime family?

03:24.463 --> 03:27.619
And one of the most powerful and feared

03:27.690 --> 03:29.372
mafia dons of his day,

03:29.444 --> 03:31.722
until he disappeared Jimmy Hoffa style.

03:31.793 --> 03:34.983
And for over three decades,
he was right here.

03:35.055 --> 03:37.017
We just found Vince Bianchi.

03:37.088 --> 03:39.306
Vince Bianchi,

03:39.358 --> 03:42.794
before he turned into the pile
of bones you guys found.

03:42.827 --> 03:45.912
Back then, we were trying
to take him off the streets.

03:46.170 --> 03:49.992
Then on July 30, 1978,
somebody did it for us.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.497
High-profile case like this,

03:51.567 --> 03:53.409
Gates sure did pick the wrong week

03:53.478 --> 03:54.959
to go to a terrorism seminar.

03:55.003 --> 03:56.300
Detective Boyle,

03:56.315 --> 03:57.679
could one of the other crime families

03:57.694 --> 03:58.650
have had him killed?

03:58.680 --> 03:59.912
It's definitely possible.

03:59.947 --> 04:02.084
"Mickey The Blade" Carcano,

04:02.670 --> 04:04.160
Louie "The Lip" Maneri.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.809
Both wanted to muscle in
on Bianchi's territory,

04:06.877 --> 04:08.061
so they had motive.

04:08.130 --> 04:10.974
It's like being transported
to a bygone era.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.175
Mickey The Blade. Louie The Lip.

04:13.243 --> 04:14.834
Where are these guys now?

04:14.904 --> 04:16.583
Probably under concrete.

04:16.629 --> 04:19.708
Vince also had rivals
inside the Bianchi family.

04:19.762 --> 04:21.541
Were any of these rivals suspects?

04:21.610 --> 04:23.066
Yeah, this guy.

04:23.134 --> 04:25.266
Frank Russo, one of his lieutenants.

04:25.335 --> 04:28.043
He took over the Bianchi family
after Vince vanished

04:28.088 --> 04:31.179
and was one of the last people
to see him alive.

04:31.225 --> 04:34.611
They had dinner together
that night at Gino's restaurant.

04:35.089 --> 04:38.394
The owner snapped this picture
of Frank and Vince...

04:38.440 --> 04:40.929
the last known photo of Vince Bianchi.

04:40.976 --> 04:44.601
Frank claimed he drove Vince
home and never saw him again.

04:44.663 --> 04:46.132
What do you think really happened?

04:46.179 --> 04:49.294
I think Frank talked Vince
into a night on the town,

04:49.333 --> 04:52.226
lured him someplace, and killed him.

04:52.295 --> 04:54.142
But we could never prove it.

04:54.704 --> 04:55.718
Castle, look at the suit

04:55.743 --> 04:57.395
that Vince was wearing
at the restaurant.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.376
It's black. It's not powder blue.

04:59.407 --> 05:01.777
So, he did go out after dinner
that night.

05:01.811 --> 05:03.374
And Frank Russo was lying.

05:04.121 --> 05:06.191
We need to talk to Frank Russo.

05:06.888 --> 05:09.050
Vince was a good man. God rest.

05:09.511 --> 05:11.347
Now at least he'll get a proper burial.

05:11.381 --> 05:12.666
Yeah, Mr. Russo,

05:12.706 --> 05:14.785
we'd like to revisit the night
that he disappeared.

05:14.817 --> 05:16.387
Look, that whole thing was ages ago.

05:16.433 --> 05:17.902
Right, and after it happened,

05:17.934 --> 05:19.629
you took over the Bianchi crime family.

05:19.672 --> 05:20.784
Isn't that true?

05:20.807 --> 05:22.928
I'm legit now. I own several businesses.

05:22.996 --> 05:24.135
Marie: Oh, yeah.

05:24.204 --> 05:27.621
Crumbs the family threw you when
they shoved you out the door.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.072
Hey, excuse me for making
an honest living

05:29.142 --> 05:31.263
to keep 4,000 square feet
over your head!

05:31.334 --> 05:35.091
Yeah, but it's not
the penthouse, is it, Frank?

05:35.147 --> 05:37.024
It's not the top floor.

05:40.731 --> 05:41.995
What are you gonna do?

05:42.028 --> 05:43.745
You know, why don't you just
walk us through

05:43.816 --> 05:45.797
what happened at Gino's restaurant?

05:45.868 --> 05:49.148
Vince and I broke bread,
we shot the breeze.

05:49.187 --> 05:51.724
Vince talked about the future,
settling down,

05:51.772 --> 05:54.448
how important it was for a don
to be a family man.

05:54.624 --> 05:56.926
After dinner,
I dropped him home. That was it.

05:56.961 --> 05:58.803
And you and Vince
didn't go out afterwards?

05:58.833 --> 05:59.559
Again with this?

05:59.583 --> 06:01.161
How many times do I got to say it? No.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.563
Then why was he found
in a different suit

06:02.634 --> 06:04.619
than the one that he wore
at Gino's restaurant?

06:04.670 --> 06:05.963
I have no idea.

06:05.994 --> 06:08.020
If he went out after, it's news to me.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.056
But if he did go out,
Harold would've known about it.

06:11.517 --> 06:12.426
Harold?

06:12.447 --> 06:13.475
Harold Leone.

06:13.476 --> 06:15.909
Vince didn't brush his teeth
without talking to Harold.

06:16.013 --> 06:18.162
If you ask me, Frank's just
pointing at something shiny

06:18.179 --> 06:20.062
so you quit looking at him.

06:20.109 --> 06:21.562
Yeah, well, that's very possible,

06:21.586 --> 06:23.680
but who is Harold Leone?

06:23.712 --> 06:26.087
Vince's advisor, his consigliere.

06:26.118 --> 06:27.725
Like Tom Hagen in "The Godfather."

06:27.765 --> 06:29.218
Yeah, but after Vince went missing,

06:29.287 --> 06:31.662
Harold kind of dropped off the world.

06:31.734 --> 06:32.920
Was he ever a suspect?

06:32.991 --> 06:33.969
No.

06:34.039 --> 06:35.959
But word was he knew things.

06:36.039 --> 06:37.958
So, where can we find him now?

06:38.022 --> 06:40.257
I might have an address in my files.

06:43.218 --> 06:44.762
Excuse me, ma'am.

06:45.015 --> 06:45.671
Hi.

06:45.742 --> 06:47.314
NYPD.

06:47.384 --> 06:48.642
We're looking for Harold Leone.

06:48.711 --> 06:49.758
Is this where he lives?

06:49.830 --> 06:51.967
Uh, I'm Yvonne. I look after Harold.

06:52.026 --> 06:53.694
Well, we'd like to speak with him.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.383
Are you sure about that?

06:55.454 --> 06:57.164
I mean, he's a sweet man deep down,

06:57.236 --> 06:58.648
but he's just a little off.

06:59.523 --> 07:00.957
Off how?

07:01.028 --> 07:04.077
Pathological grieving
is what they call it.

07:04.523 --> 07:06.925
Harold's best friend disappeared
back in '78,

07:06.949 --> 07:08.473
and Harold, he never got over it.

07:08.543 --> 07:09.507
Never moved on.

07:09.585 --> 07:11.687
It's like he's frozen in time.

07:11.749 --> 07:15.092
That's why he stays home
and still owns this car

07:15.162 --> 07:17.989
and makes me wear these dumb-ass clothes.

07:18.057 --> 07:21.987
I'm sorry, are you saying that
Harold thinks it's the 1970s?

07:22.057 --> 07:23.227
Yeah.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.655
And anything that happens
that bursts that bubble,

07:25.717 --> 07:27.336
oh, he just gets all confused.

07:27.383 --> 07:29.003
So, when you go in to talk to him,

07:29.051 --> 07:31.121
just turn off your cellphones...
mm-hmm...

07:31.158 --> 07:32.638
pretend like it's 40 years ago.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.743
You shouldn't have any problem.

07:34.811 --> 07:38.258
Actually, <i>you</i> will have a problem.

07:38.329 --> 07:40.809
<i>Edith, I'm home!</i>

07:40.880 --> 07:42.567
<i>Oh, hello, Archie!</i>

07:42.638 --> 07:45.975
Whoa. Look at this place.

07:46.639 --> 07:47.852
Harold?!

07:48.123 --> 07:49.730
You have guests!

07:50.514 --> 07:52.594
Harold: Huh?

07:55.607 --> 07:56.997
Whoa!

07:57.040 --> 08:00.555
Well, this hot mama could be
my guest all night long.

08:00.592 --> 08:04.172
Uh, sir, I'm Detective Beckett,
and this is Mr. Castle.

08:04.195 --> 08:05.563
- Captain.
- Castle.

08:05.603 --> 08:07.283
Well, Captain Castle,

08:07.332 --> 08:10.439
I bet you're, uh, showing this
little lady the ropes, huh?

08:10.470 --> 08:11.825
Breaking her in, huh?

08:11.893 --> 08:13.266
Well, actually, um...

08:13.334 --> 08:17.390
I mean, have you ever seen a cop
with an ass that fine?

08:17.458 --> 08:19.537
If this is women's lib, I'm all for it.

08:19.604 --> 08:20.642
Excuse me?

08:20.710 --> 08:22.787
To be fair, you do have a very fine...

08:22.856 --> 08:23.861
never mind.

08:23.929 --> 08:25.972
So, how can I help you, Captain?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.019
Oh.

08:27.538 --> 08:31.307
Uh, well, truth is,
we are here about Vince Bianchi.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.448
You found him?

08:33.515 --> 08:34.991
I'm afraid we did.

08:35.058 --> 08:36.900
He was found in a light-blue suit.

08:36.953 --> 08:38.224
We believe he went somewhere

08:38.274 --> 08:40.552
after he left Gino's restaurant
the night that he was killed.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.861
Now, we were told he kept you
informed about what he did.

08:43.909 --> 08:45.920
You have any idea
where he went that night?

08:45.988 --> 08:47.864
Yeah.

08:47.932 --> 08:50.899
And I know who killed him, too.

08:51.469 --> 08:56.629

09:03.345 --> 09:04.534
Just to be clear,

09:04.601 --> 09:07.087
you're saying you know
who killed Vince Bianchi?

09:07.149 --> 09:08.207
What's his name?

09:08.734 --> 09:10.751
That's a dangerous question, sweetheart.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.108
I'm gonna need protection.

09:12.109 --> 09:14.358
I can assign officers
to protect you if necessary.

38:29.212 --> 38:31.741
and unite the two families.

gonna propose that night.

Who is Michael Carcano's sister?
What's her name?

Frank's not here.

Yeah, actually, we're not
looking for Frank, Mrs. Russo.

Okay, so then why don't you tell us

38:54.007 --> 38:56.275
what happened at Glitterati
the night that Vince vanished?

38:56.346 --> 38:58.678
- How would I know?
- Because you were there.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.258
What are you talking about?

39:01.278 --> 39:03.358
Vince had "Last Dance" playing.

39:03.365 --> 39:05.410
You thought he was going to propose,

39:05.425 --> 39:10.407
to cement, as it were, the union
between your two families.

39:10.424 --> 39:11.907
But he couldn't go through with it.

39:11.908 --> 39:13.665
You couldn't handle the rejection.

39:13.682 --> 39:15.763
So, as he left,
you shot him in the back,

39:15.764 --> 39:17.322
then again in the face.

39:17.393 --> 39:19.154
You know, because it was personal.

39:19.810 --> 39:22.013
You guys have quite the imagination.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.294
Your brother knew that Vince's
murder would trigger a mob war,

39:25.328 --> 39:27.078
so he used his access to concrete

39:27.079 --> 39:28.904
to make Vince disappear.

39:28.905 --> 39:31.877
After that, you hitched
your wagon to Frank,

39:31.947 --> 39:34.542
but his tenure as head of
the Bianchi family was...

39:34.613 --> 39:36.526
disappointingly brief.

Robert Decker decided that he
didn't want to die in prison,

39:52.454 --> 39:53.716
