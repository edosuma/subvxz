<b>Now! Kill him!</b>

01:45.000 --> 01:50.040
<b>Fake x And x Psyche</b>

02:36.330 --> 02:39.090
<b>Hey, what's going on?!</b>

02:39.090 --> 02:40.170
<b>Below us!</b>

02:40.170 --> 02:42.590
<b>There was a huge explosion below us.</b>

02:43.220 --> 02:44.960
<b>Enough waiting around...</b>

02:44.960 --> 02:47.170
<b>I'll see what's happening for myself!</b>

02:47.170 --> 02:48.850
<b>Everyone, please calm down.</b>

02:49.320 --> 02:52.480
<b>I finally managed to contact the Ten Dons.</b>

02:52.830 --> 02:56.500
<b>They wish to speak to you directly.</b>

02:56.940 --> 03:00.740
<b>The auction will proceed, 
so please remain calm.</b>

03:01.390 --> 03:04.420
<b>Please enter the auction hall 
on the tenth floor.</b>

03:05.740 --> 03:12.750
<b>An underground chamber where everything costs extra.
That is where you will sleep. 
Never descend stairs that you didn't first ascend. 
Do not compete with others at numbers.</b>

03:06.590 --> 03:07.810
<b><i>I'll be fine.</i></b>

03:07.810 --> 03:09.710
<b><i>This is the tenth floor.</i></b>

03:09.710 --> 03:12.750
<b><i>I'll be safe as long as I don't 
go down any stairs...</i></b>

03:12.750 --> 03:14.630
<b><i>It's all good.</i></b>

03:14.630 --> 03:17.760
<b><i>Her fortunes are one hundred 
percent accurate.</i></b>

03:18.470 --> 03:22.760
<b><i>Her fortunes won't come true 
if you heed the warning.</i></b>

03:23.490 --> 03:24.590
<b><i>So I'm okay...</i></b>

03:32.960 --> 03:35.770
<b>Yo, everyone all right?</b>

03:35.770 --> 03:38.980
<b>First, I apologize for taking 
so long to make contact.</b>

03:38.980 --> 03:40.280
<b>Sorry.</b>

03:41.070 --> 03:43.120
<b>There's been a lot of chaos,</b>

03:43.120 --> 03:44.780
<b>but it's all cleared up now.</b>

03:45.410 --> 03:48.790
<b>We've dealt with the Phantom Troupe's leader.</b>

03:51.720 --> 03:55.400
<b>It's only a matter of time before 
the rest of them are finished.</b>

03:55.400 --> 03:57.670
<b>We're letting the professionals 
handle the hunt</b>

03:57.670 --> 03:59.810
<b>so you can enjoy the auction.</b>

04:01.390 --> 04:05.550
<b>Tonight, we'll be watching the auction live,</b>

04:05.940 --> 04:09.210
<b>so let us see some furious bidding.</b>

04:11.130 --> 04:13.310
<b>As you all just heard,</b>

04:13.830 --> 04:17.360
<b>the Ten Dons will be watching a 
live feed of the proceedings.</b>

04:18.050 --> 04:20.280
<b>Please concentrate on the auction.</b>

05:02.700 --> 05:03.780
<b>Illumi?</b>

05:04.330 --> 05:05.280
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:05.280 --> 05:06.820
<b>Where is my client?</b>

05:07.430 --> 05:08.520
<b>Right here.</b>

05:15.770 --> 05:18.330
<b>Oh, were you fighting?</b>

05:18.330 --> 05:19.790
<b>Is he still alive?</b>

05:20.800 --> 05:22.260
<b>Just in the nick of time...</b>

05:22.670 --> 05:24.180
<b>That's a relief.</b>

05:24.180 --> 05:25.370
<b>Well, relay a message.</b>

05:26.430 --> 05:29.070
<b>I've killed the Ten Dons.</b>

05:29.070 --> 05:32.590
<b>Tell him to wire the money 
to my account as agreed.</b>

05:34.540 --> 05:36.420
<b>Up we go...</b>

05:36.420 --> 05:38.060
<b>Good grief.</b>

05:38.370 --> 05:40.750
<b>It seems we both get to live another day.</b>

05:41.230 --> 05:42.570
<b>Aren't you supposed to kill me?</b>

05:42.930 --> 05:45.810
<b>We were hired by the Ten Dons.</b>

05:45.810 --> 05:49.820
<b>Now that they're all dead,</b>

05:49.820 --> 05:52.310
<b>you are no longer our target.</b>

05:53.330 --> 05:55.330
<b>Really? That's surprising.</b>

05:55.840 --> 05:58.320
<b>You won't get another chance like this.</b>

05:58.320 --> 06:03.360
<b>Do you believe that we kill for pleasure?</b>

06:04.350 --> 06:06.600
<b>We don't do this for fun.</b>

06:06.600 --> 06:10.840
<b>I refuse to work for nothing 
or die for nothing.</b>

06:11.350 --> 06:16.100
<b>Did you know that I hired Illumi 
to assassinate the Ten Dons?</b>

06:16.430 --> 06:17.850
<b>Of course.</b>

06:17.850 --> 06:20.850
<b>But that's irrelevant.</b>

06:21.250 --> 06:24.780
<b>We simply do the job we're hired for.</b>

06:24.780 --> 06:26.050
<b>I see.</b>

06:26.530 --> 06:28.730
<b>Say, can I ask you something?</b>

06:30.800 --> 06:33.020
<b>If you and I were to fight one-on-one,</b>

06:33.020 --> 06:34.370
<b>who would win?</b>

06:36.030 --> 06:38.540
<b>Most likely, I would win.</b>

06:39.490 --> 06:43.930
<b>Unless you decided to actually try to kill me.</b>

06:44.860 --> 06:47.070
<b>Honestly, you're a cheeky kid.</b>

06:48.660 --> 06:50.280
<b><i>So he could tell?</i></b>

07:10.240 --> 07:12.010
<b>What a drag...</b>

07:13.910 --> 07:16.050
<b>I couldn't steal their powers.</b>

07:20.470 --> 07:23.420
<b>So you want us to wait at L Hospital?</b>

07:23.750 --> 07:26.880
<b>Yeah, it's more dangerous 
here than anticipated.</b>

07:26.880 --> 07:29.420
<b>We'll send her over by ambulance.</b>

07:30.090 --> 07:33.430
<b>She's just unconscious, 
so you shouldn't have to worry.</b>

07:33.430 --> 07:37.770
<b>But she'll be much safer at a hospital.</b>

07:37.770 --> 07:39.050
<b>Make the preparations.</b>

07:41.960 --> 07:45.310
<b>Looks like you had fun, boss...</b>

07:45.910 --> 07:46.870
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:47.700 --> 07:49.720
<b>I'm a little tired now.</b>

07:49.720 --> 07:52.230
<b>You were up against the Zoldyck family.</b>

07:52.920 --> 07:57.400
<b>I wish I could've seen how 
those two fought you.</b>

07:58.580 --> 08:01.210
<b>Fighting would be more fun than watching.</b>

08:02.770 --> 08:05.950
<b>Kortopi, everything ready?</b>

08:05.950 --> 08:06.630
<b>Of course.</b>

08:07.600 --> 08:09.660
<b>I can't make living copies,</b>

08:09.660 --> 08:11.380
<b>but I can provide static copies.</b>

08:12.780 --> 08:14.410
<b>Good enough.</b>

08:14.410 --> 08:16.040
<b>Then we'll stick to the plan.</b>

08:16.040 --> 08:16.600
<b>Also...</b>

08:19.240 --> 08:22.480
<b>Don't touch the ambulance that girl is in.</b>

08:25.470 --> 08:28.730
<b>Will we really be safe on the trip over?</b>

08:28.730 --> 08:33.250
<b>If they planned to attack the ambulance, 
they would've done so on its way here.</b>

08:34.250 --> 08:36.770
<b>And you shouldn't have to worry 
about stray bullets anymore.</b>

08:39.300 --> 08:41.880
<b>It's the moment you've all been waiting for.</b>

08:41.880 --> 08:46.000
<b>We will now begin the auction!</b>

08:49.410 --> 08:54.010
<b>Allow me to introduce our 
first item of the night...</b>

08:55.640 --> 08:57.760
<b><i>I was concerned for a moment.</i></b>

08:57.760 --> 08:59.980
<b><i>But all's well that ends well.</i></b>

09:01.020 --> 09:04.580
<b><i>And none of the leaders were hurt.</i></b>

09:05.140 --> 09:06.020
<b><i>We did well.</i></b>

09:10.400 --> 09:11.390
<b>Thanks.</b>

09:25.120 --> 09:28.250
<b>Allow me to introduce the next item.</b>

<b>What do you mean?</b>

10:39.650 --> 10:41.820
<b>The leader of the Troupe was killed.</b>

10:42.530 --> 10:44.140
<b>Why wouldn't they proceed?</b>

10:45.390 --> 10:46.930
<b>Impossible.</b>

10:47.770 --> 10:49.100
<b>It can't be...</b>

10:49.810 --> 10:52.360
<b>We're just mopping up leftovers now.</b>

10:52.360 --> 10:54.990

<b>You think you can just walk away?</b>

16:13.300 --> 16:14.260
<b>Tsk...</b>

16:14.880 --> 16:15.530
<b>Stop!</b>

16:16.200 --> 16:17.800
<b>I'll blow your head off!</b>

16:18.580 --> 16:19.540
<b>Move.</b>

16:20.650 --> 16:22.120
<b>Don't be...</b>

16:25.140 --> 16:26.910
<b>Just stop.</b>

16:27.730 --> 16:30.520
<b>I don't care who I kill right now...</b>

16:32.580 --> 16:35.300
<b>Even if it's you.</b>

16:56.590 --> 17:00.080
<b>Who is that guy?</b>

17:08.820 --> 17:10.750
<b>Yeah, I'm getting into this!</b>

17:10.750 --> 17:12.520
<b>How about another?</b>

17:13.570 --> 17:14.800
<b>Seriously...</b>

17:15.330 --> 17:18.350
<b>They were drinking while 
we were captured?</b>

17:18.700 --> 17:20.890
<b>Oh, you're back?</b>

17:20.890 --> 17:23.350
<b>Come and drink with us!</b>

17:23.590 --> 17:24.950
<b>Are you an idiot?</b>

17:24.950 --> 17:26.860
<b>We're underage!</b>

17:26.860 --> 17:29.110
<b>And aren't you underage too?</b>

17:29.260 --> 17:30.940
<b>What's your point?</b>

17:30.940 --> 17:34.850
<b>In my country, you can drink 
once you're sixteen.</b>

17:34.850 --> 17:36.110
<b>I see.</b>

17:38.240 --> 17:39.120
<b>Really...</b>

17:39.530 --> 17:41.240
<b>I had no idea that happened.</b>

17:41.800 --> 17:44.130
<b>I'm amazed you escaped alive.</b>

17:44.540 --> 17:48.130
<b>The Phantom Troupe's that dangerous?</b>

17:48.800 --> 17:53.810
<b>Back there, one of the tricks 
you taught us came in handy.</b>

17:58.960 --> 18:01.370
<b><i>If the exit is blocked...</i></b>

18:01.370 --> 18:03.600
<b><i>Make your own!</i></b>

18:04.640 --> 18:06.100
<b>I get it.</b>

18:06.440 --> 18:10.600
<b>I'm glad I was able to help in some way.</b>

18:15.270 --> 18:17.820
<b>Experience can sometimes blind you.</b>

18:18.430 --> 18:22.440
<b>A con artist's knowledge might come 
in handy against the Troupe.</b>

18:22.440 --> 18:23.370
<b>Exactly!</b>

18:23.710 --> 18:25.680
<b>There's more to being a con 
artist than you'd think.</b>

18:25.680 --> 18:29.210
<b>I haven't just been drinking 
myself senseless here...</b>

18:29.210 --> 18:32.030
<b>I've been learning a lot from Zepile.</b>

18:32.030 --> 18:35.040
<b>And tomorrow morning, 
we'll hit the auction.</b>

18:35.040 --> 18:36.770
<b>You guys are coming, right?</b>

18:39.090 --> 18:42.390
<b>I'd like to, but I have to find Kurapika 
and learn about <i>Nen</i> from him.</b>

18:42.960 --> 18:45.370
<b>Kurapika? You got through to him?</b>

18:45.370 --> 18:48.640
<b>Yep, but we're waiting for 
him to call us back.</b>

18:48.640 --> 18:49.530
<b>Hold on.</b>

18:49.530 --> 18:51.400
<b>Did you say you need to learn 
about <i>Nen</i> from him?</b>

18:51.790 --> 18:53.000
<b>I did.</b>

18:53.000 --> 18:54.140
<b>Why?</b>

18:54.140 --> 18:56.910
<b>He just learned about <i>Nen</i> 
recently himself, right?</b>

18:56.910 --> 19:00.410
<b>But Kurapika managed to defeat a 
member of the Phantom Troupe.</b>

19:01.000 --> 19:01.910
<b>Seriously?</b>

19:02.280 --> 19:03.400
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:03.820 --> 19:07.410
<b>He must know some secret about <i>Nen</i>.</b>

19:08.200 --> 19:12.400
<b>Some strength that doesn't 
require experience or power.</b>

19:16.780 --> 19:17.930
<b>Yay!</b>

19:17.930 --> 19:19.430
<b>Thanks, Daddy!</b>

19:20.890 --> 19:22.400
<b>They're beautiful...</b>

19:24.300 --> 19:26.470
<b>Are you feeling better now?</b>

19:26.470 --> 19:28.700
<b>Uh-huh, I forgive you!</b>

19:28.700 --> 19:29.960
<b>Really?</b>

19:29.960 --> 19:31.920
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

19:38.160 --> 19:39.890
<b>Good work.</b>

19:39.890 --> 19:42.240
<b>My daughter is doing well,</b>

19:42.240 --> 19:43.950
<b>so we'll head back to the hotel.</b>

19:45.450 --> 19:50.040
<b>Tomorrow, we need to buy 
the actor's used tissue.</b>

19:50.040 --> 19:51.610
<b>And that will end the auction.</b>

19:53.200 --> 19:55.990
<b>I'll be leaving the morning of 
the day after tomorrow.</b>

19:55.990 --> 19:59.900
<b>But I want you to accompany 
my daughter as she shops.</b>

20:09.370 --> 20:10.480
<b>Kurapika...</b>

20:10.970 --> 20:15.230
<b>We can handle the remainder 
of the auction and shopping.</b>

20:16.020 --> 20:18.190
<b>You should get some rest.</b>

20:19.580 --> 20:20.740
<b>Yes...</b>

20:21.890 --> 20:25.740
<b>Thanks, I think I'll do that.</b>

20:27.850 --> 20:30.510
<b>Is he really okay?</b>

20:43.200 --> 20:45.010
<b>Hello? Kurapika?</b>

20:46.840 --> 20:47.590
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:49.490 --> 20:52.160
<b>You said you wanted to 
stop the Troupe, right?</b>

20:52.790 --> 20:56.020
<b>That won't be necessary now.</b>

20:57.960 --> 20:59.470
<b>The spider is dead.</b>

20:59.470 --> 21:01.370
<b>Huh? What do you mean?</b>

21:01.370 --> 21:02.780
<b>Kurapika?!</b>

21:07.760 --> 21:09.970
<b>Oh, a shame.</b>

21:12.410 --> 21:15.220
<b>I'd hoped to provide some comfort.</b>

21:17.320 --> 21:20.540
<b>The Mafia community was nothing special.</b>

21:21.160 --> 21:23.530
<b>We didn't even need Nobunaga.</b>

21:23.530 --> 21:24.280
<b>Shut up!</b>

21:25.540 --> 21:26.680
<b>What'd he say?</b>

21:26.680 --> 21:28.060
<b>The Troupe's dead.</b>

21:28.060 --> 21:29.300
<b>What?!</b>

21:29.300 --> 21:30.430
<b>Seriously?</b>

21:30.860 --> 21:32.600
<b>He hung up.</b>

21:33.520 --> 21:36.560
<b>I have no way to find out any more.</b>

21:45.180 --> 21:49.840
<b>Kurapika is now drowning in 
an indescribable emptiness.</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.240
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300

23:09.610 --> 23:11.370
<b>Today, we introduce Kortopi.</b>

23:11.050 --> 23:12.700
<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:11.370 --> 23:12.450
<b>A member of the Phantom Troupe.</b>

23:12.450 --> 23:14.280
<b>Beware of Gallery Fake, his ability to</b>

23:12.700 --> 23:14.450
<b>A Conjurer.</b>

23:14.280 --> 23:15.800
<b>conjure a copy in his right hand</b>

23:14.450 --> 23:20.190
<b>Uses his right hand to copy 
what his left touches.</b>

23:15.800 --> 23:17.370
<b>of what his left hand is touching.</b>

23:17.370 --> 23:18.990
<b>I might be a fake.</b>

23:18.990 --> 23:19.710
<b>What?</b>

23:18.990 --> 23:21.310
<b>Note: He can't conjure living copies.</b>

23:25.470 --> 23:28.050
<b>Next time: Fortunes x Aren't x Right?</b>

23:28.050 --> 23:30.050
<b>My horoscope was horrible today.</b>

23:30.050 --> 23:31.980
<b>Oh, there's a Choco Robo here.</b>

23:31.980 --> 23:34.810
<b>Lucky! So much for that horoscope!</b>
