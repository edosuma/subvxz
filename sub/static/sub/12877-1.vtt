00:56.454 --> 00:59.356
Yeah well this is what the
problem is right here.

01:03.294 --> 01:04.962
What are you doing here?

01:08.466 --> 01:09.299
Yikes.

01:13.772 --> 01:15.139
Hello?

01:15.207 --> 01:16.641
Hey girl.

01:18.443 --> 01:21.212
No I'm supposed to be on my way back.
I told you I had something else to do.

01:21.413 --> 01:23.715
Yeah I'm out here dealing with
this pipe.

01:25.918 --> 01:27.486
You're going to deal with the pipe.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.122
Why don't you cook a little
something up and, uh, you know...

01:30.189 --> 01:31.857
I'll bring some champagne.

01:32.959 --> 01:33.893
Yeah.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.060
Alright.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.996
See you when I see ya.

01:40.066 --> 01:43.136
Yeah you're luck
she's in a good mood.

02:27.183 --> 02:31.921
Good morning all you lovely Michiganders!
It's a great day to be Up North.

02:31.989 --> 02:36.893
Highs in the upper 70s/low 80s today and
all week, and not a drop of rain in sight.

02:36.961 --> 02:39.261
I can't think of a better way to
kick off the summer,

02:39.329 --> 02:43.066
and celebrate all of that ice
finally melting in Lake Michigan,

02:43.133 --> 02:47.070
than to grab your bathing suit and
your suntan lotion and hit the beach.

02:47.271 --> 02:50.874
You know, they say in Michigan you're
never more than six miles from a lake,

02:50.942 --> 02:52.843
so no excuses on not getting out
there.

02:52.911 --> 02:57.815
Winter is finally over, school's out, and
the trees have all of their leaves again.

02:57.882 --> 03:00.417
It's time to frolic the sun
while we still have it!

03:00.485 --> 03:04.322
So break out the barbecue, air out
the cabin, and enjoy all that summer in

03:04.389 --> 03:09.894
Michigan has to offer, because in six months
will all be up to our necks again in snow.

03:09.962 --> 03:13.798
But for now, life is good in the
Great Lakes State!

03:49.236 --> 03:51.538
Hey, where's everyone?

03:51.605 --> 03:53.975
The gas isn't working yet.

03:54.176 --> 03:56.144
I've been trying to make you
eggs for the last 10 minutes.

03:56.211 --> 03:58.179
Should be working. I had hot
water.

03:58.246 --> 04:01.949
I'll call John from the rental office. In
the mean time, this is all you get. Sorry.

04:02.151 --> 04:03.151
I'll take it.

04:03.618 --> 04:04.986
So where are the kids?

04:05.054 --> 04:08.157
Hold that thought.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.259
This is Michael.

04:13.029 --> 04:14.296
What's that?

04:15.598 --> 04:17.933
No no no, I can't hear you at
all.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.334
- Nicole?
- Say it again?

04:19.402 --> 04:21.970
- Yeah?
- Can you come here, please?

04:24.075 --> 04:25.374
What?

04:25.976 --> 04:27.010
Are you going somewhere?

04:27.078 --> 04:28.945
I'm going to the beach with
Alex.

04:29.013 --> 04:32.515
No no, slow down. I got all that. What I
didn't get was the part about the turbines?

04:32.583 --> 04:34.084
What's happening?

04:34.151 --> 04:35.551
What? Nicole wait!

04:35.619 --> 04:36.452
What's going on with
them?

04:36.520 --> 04:38.321
Is the water at the beach ok?

04:38.388 --> 04:39.388
Hold on a second Will...

04:39.456 --> 04:41.959
It's fine. Lampreys don't attack
people.

04:42.694 --> 04:44.895
Unless you act like a fish.

04:45.964 --> 04:47.264
I'm kidding.

04:47.465 --> 04:49.900
Alright, cool story dad. Can I
go now?

04:49.968 --> 04:54.571
Yes. Just uh, keep your phone on ok?
'Cause Kyle may be meeting with you later.

04:54.639 --> 04:56.407
- Alright bye!
- Alright.

04:56.475 --> 04:57.809
Yeah that's fine. Get your
office together. Meet me

04:57.877 --> 05:00.846
by the turbines and we'll see
what's jamming it up.

05:01.047 --> 05:03.181
10 minutes is perfect. Ok.

05:03.249 --> 05:05.951
Turbines are down at the Dam.

05:06.018 --> 05:08.386
So what does that have to do
with you?

05:08.687 --> 05:10.288
Don't know yet.

05:11.190 --> 05:12.959
Who's Alex?

05:13.727 --> 05:16.129
Some boy that she met.

05:16.496 --> 05:19.298
We're here a day, and she's
already met a boy?

05:19.366 --> 05:23.369
That's what happens when you take
a teenager away from her friends.

05:23.436 --> 05:25.938
So I've heard.

05:26.306 --> 05:27.640
What ever happened to Joe?

05:29.310 --> 05:32.312
She broke up with Joel 2 months
ago.

05:33.281 --> 05:35.582
Dad! Dad! Look what I caught!

05:36.050 --> 05:37.651
That's great buddy.

05:37.852 --> 05:39.052
Hey!

05:40.288 --> 05:42.455
Look, it's a big ole trout!

05:42.523 --> 05:43.590
And check it out!

05:43.658 --> 05:45.126
Michael!

05:45.194 --> 05:47.361
It's got a Lamprey!

05:48.430 --> 05:51.266
Son of a gun. Look at that.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.576
See, look all those other
Lamprey marks.

06:01.644 --> 06:04.046
Just like you said Dad. Isn't it
cool?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.380
Yeah.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.517
Yeah cool. Can you just
take it outside, please?

06:17.494 --> 06:19.595
Just not our lucky day.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.432
I know you're hungry boy.

06:23.201 --> 06:25.068
I'm hungry too.

06:25.269 --> 06:27.537
There ain't no fish in this
water.

07:07.314 --> 07:09.715
Right now. You see how hard they
are to come off?

07:09.783 --> 07:11.251
Right?

07:11.318 --> 07:13.253
That's why you always want to
handle them, right back here.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.453
Behind the head.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.322
Just to be safe.

07:16.523 --> 07:19.692
Dad, Can I come to work with
you?

07:19.760 --> 07:22.062
I'll tell you what, how about
tomorrow?

07:22.130 --> 07:22.696
Ok.

07:22.764 --> 07:24.365
Alright, cool.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.502
- Cool.
- Look at that, huh?

07:33.375 --> 07:34.308
No.

07:36.477 --> 07:37.545
Hey.

07:37.613 --> 07:38.479
You want to keep'em?

07:38.547 --> 07:39.647
Ok?

07:39.715 --> 07:41.783
Alright, look, We gotta get him
in a tank.

07:41.850 --> 07:43.718
There's one in the back of my
truck.

07:43.786 --> 07:46.487
Keep the lid on it at all times. Otherwise
it will climb up the side and get out.

07:47.556 --> 07:50.258
Nice pet Michael. It looks like
an anus with teeth.

07:50.326 --> 07:51.793
Come on.

07:51.860 --> 07:53.395
Hey hey hey!

07:54.898 --> 07:56.265
Hello.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.801
Hi. Oh my god.

07:58.868 --> 07:59.635
Yeah.

07:59.702 --> 08:01.137
Those eels?

08:01.204 --> 08:02.939
Oh actually they're not eels.
These are Lampreys. They're uh-

08:03.006 --> 08:07.609
Oh what are you? Are you a Fish and
Wildlife service? Oh my, look at you.

08:07.677 --> 08:09.545
So you know all about that
stuff.

08:09.612 --> 08:11.148
Little bit, yeah.

08:11.215 --> 08:12.816
- Totally do.
- Yeah.

08:12.883 --> 08:16.753
I'm Ellen, I live just like
right there.

08:16.821 --> 08:17.887
Right.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.790
- Hi. Hi I'm Cate.
- Hi.

08:20.858 --> 08:22.092
Cookies.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.761
Thanks and this is my
husband, Michael.

08:25.229 --> 08:27.832
- I just though I would just say hi and-
- That's nice of you.

08:27.899 --> 08:29.834
You know, welcome you guys to
the neighborhood.

08:29.901 --> 08:32.403
- That's very sweet of you. Thank you.
- So sweet.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.905
So I also wanted to just tell
you to be very careful.

08:35.975 --> 08:39.610
Because Ted Jorgensen went
missing last week.

08:39.678 --> 08:42.246
And like no one can find him,
and everyone thinks is like a,

08:42.315 --> 08:44.683
like a wolf, like attacked
him or something.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.219
We will probably be fine, right
Michael?

08:47.287 --> 08:48.854
Well, I mean you can never be
too careful.

08:48.921 --> 08:50.822
Sure. That's right.
True. Yeah.

08:52.392 --> 08:54.593
You know we are totally good.
We're just here for the summer.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.796
You guys are welcome to enjoy my
pool.

08:57.864 --> 09:01.534
Anytime, just feel free
to help yourself.

09:01.602 --> 09:03.269
Thanks.

09:03.337 --> 09:05.405
Oh my god yes! I have new
neighbors.

09:05.473 --> 09:07.640
Yes, it is exciting. Thank you.

09:07.708 --> 09:09.209
Enjoy the cookies.

09:09.276 --> 09:12.212
Have a good day. Thanks for
stopping by. That was sweet of you.

09:13.747 --> 09:15.483
Can you believe that?

09:15.550 --> 09:19.786
Yeah well I told you I was a, catch.

09:19.854 --> 09:21.889
Right.

09:21.956 --> 09:24.899
Uh ok yes.  So, you're gonna have
to probably bring home dinner,

09:24.900 --> 09:27.163
- cause the gas isn't working.
- Will sushi do?

09:28.362 --> 09:29.230
No.

09:29.431 --> 09:31.466
- I'll see you later.
- Alright. Bye.

09:46.215 --> 09:49.055
There, here, and over here.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.622
The whole structure is breaking
down and, and it leaks.

09:51.657 --> 09:54.623
Now the dam is good for 10
years. 20 maybe.

09:54.691 --> 09:57.393
You know, the biggest issue is
with these turbines.

09:57.461 --> 10:01.630
Not the Lamprey population. Once we
get these cleared out and moving again,

10:01.698 --> 10:06.537
the Lampreys won't be able to slip through.
And then, I'm sorry to say Mr. Parker,

10:06.604 --> 10:08.805
you'll have made this trip for
nothing.

10:08.873 --> 10:09.940
Let's hope so.

10:10.007 --> 10:12.509
The turbines aren't the issue,
Marcy.

10:12.577 --> 10:15.812
The Lamprey population in this
river is way above normal.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.884
That's why I invited Mr. Parker
here, because he's an expert.

10:21.353 --> 10:25.557
Well, I think you're making a big
deal about nothing. They're just fish.

10:27.826 --> 10:29.227
Damn those things are ugly.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.763
Yeah, you're right Rich. They do
kinda look like YOU!

10:34.900 --> 10:36.735
No no no no.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.036
Don't do that.

10:38.105 --> 10:38.937
What?

10:39.005 --> 10:40.473
I need to examine them first.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.809
A dead Lamprey is a good
Lamprey. Where is he?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.611
Guys!

10:45.678 --> 10:48.847
Please. Just low a little respect
for Mr. Parker. He is the expert, huh.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.782
Look, there shouldn't be this
many getting through.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.252
Are there barriers set up?

10:52.320 --> 10:55.322
Yeah, the velocity barriers,
just like you guys told us.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.723
And they're still getting in,
huh?

10:56.790 --> 10:59.426
Yeah. Well, I guess so.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.461
Well, that's an issue that we're
gonna have to address.

11:01.529 --> 11:05.064
Excuse me, Mr. expert, dude
that knows more then us...

11:05.133 --> 11:07.801
We're done for today, right?

11:07.869 --> 11:09.337
I'm sorry, Mitch, is it?

11:09.404 --> 11:10.804
- No it's rich.
- It's Rich.

11:10.872 --> 11:13.907
Rich. Well if it's ok with you,
I'd still like to take a count,

11:13.975 --> 11:17.811
And please, don't throw anymore
dead ones in the water, ok?

11:17.879 --> 11:21.449
I say, dumb the whole TFM on
them, and be done with them.

11:21.517 --> 11:22.683
Nuke the lake.

11:22.751 --> 11:25.621
I like the smell of lampricide
in the morning.

11:25.622 --> 11:29.722
<i>www.hounddawgs.org</i>

11:29.925 --> 11:31.092
I'm sorry.

11:31.161 --> 11:32.594
This guy for real?

11:32.662 --> 11:34.263
Yes.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.931
The lampricide was good
enough when I used it last summer.

11:36.999 --> 11:41.103
Rich. I'm sure you're joking and
all that, but just so you know

11:41.172 --> 11:43.906
the lampricide doesn't work on
the adults.

11:43.974 --> 11:45.141
Only on the eggs.

11:45.209 --> 11:48.578
No no, it's worked. Its-Its
always worked.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.915
Well, she's as clear as she's
gonna get.

11:55.887 --> 11:56.887
Ok.

11:56.954 --> 11:59.523
Get out of the water. Throw the
switch.

12:00.091 --> 12:01.792
See if it works.

12:13.906 --> 12:15.473
Yes!

12:15.741 --> 12:16.874
Good Job.

12:23.949 --> 12:25.650
There doesn't appear to be too
many so far.

12:25.718 --> 12:28.387
But it doesn't hurt to be safe
just in case the lake gets infested.

12:28.455 --> 12:31.090
Especially if the turbine
problems continue.

12:31.825 --> 12:33.025
Do you think it'll work?

12:33.093 --> 12:35.628
What the hell is that?

12:35.696 --> 12:37.763
A stunboat.

12:37.831 --> 12:40.455
We used it in a large
direct-current barrier 

12:40.456 --> 12:43.290
to keep the population under
control and reduce it.

12:43.325 --> 12:45.839
Zap'em. Like'em.
NOT!

12:46.040 --> 12:48.408
Rich. Out.

13:04.025 --> 13:06.494
We use the stunboat for the
initial culling, alright?

13:06.562 --> 13:08.763
And then we'll keep future
generations away from the dam

13:08.830 --> 13:11.132
by building a barrier
directly in the stream bed.

13:11.199 --> 13:14.902
You'll only need it during mating season,
and it'll be low enough that it won't

13:14.970 --> 13:17.839
affect the other species. But we can't
have anymore Lamprey's entering the dam.

13:17.907 --> 13:20.576
Ok I'm not sure if a stunboat,
even a powerful one, is going to

13:20.644 --> 13:23.779
be able to take out the entire
adult Lamprey populations.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.691
- I hear you.
- We need to look for...

13:25.692 --> 13:27.585
a wider reaching solution.

13:27.620 --> 13:28.950
Sounds like job security.

13:30.119 --> 13:32.855
And that sounds like job
insecurity...

13:32.923 --> 13:35.492
Morning, people!

13:37.060 --> 13:43.266
Nothing better in the world then
sunrise on Lake Charlevoix.

13:43.634 --> 13:49.006
It's like an angel kissed this
little drip of water.

13:49.073 --> 13:50.040
Good morning, Mayor.

13:50.108 --> 13:51.776
Hey.

13:52.110 --> 13:55.713
You must be the guy they sent
from Fish and Wildlife.

13:55.781 --> 13:56.880
I'm Michael Parker, sir.

13:56.948 --> 13:59.583
- Ah, Bruce Akerman-
- Nice to met you.

13:59.651 --> 14:02.787
...but just call me, Mayor.

14:02.854 --> 14:03.722
Ok.

14:03.789 --> 14:08.193
- I only have 3 years more to hear that title.
- Ok.

14:08.260 --> 14:12.163
So, get me up to speed.

14:12.231 --> 14:13.832
The turbines are working.

14:13.899 --> 14:17.902
That's great Rich, but it doesn't
help with the fish problem.

14:17.970 --> 14:19.871
Actually it does, Mayor.

14:19.939 --> 14:23.576
Um, we need the turbines working to keep the
population of Lamprey's under control here,

14:23.644 --> 14:26.813
and to the connecting waterways
to Lake Michigan.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.581
That ain't gonna happen.

14:28.649 --> 14:33.118
This is the best fishing in the
world. Right here on Lake Charlevoix.

14:33.186 --> 14:34.754
Ain't that right, Will?

14:34.822 --> 14:36.522
Yes, sir. The best.

14:36.590 --> 14:39.660
Happen you hear anything about Ted?

14:39.728 --> 14:42.563
No...No.

14:42.864 --> 14:44.164
So, what do you think?

14:44.232 --> 14:46.600
Two days at the most?

14:46.668 --> 14:49.802
Well, It's-It's hard to say
at this point...

14:50.170 --> 14:55.543
Look. I know this is a big
government job...

14:55.611 --> 14:57.679
But I have a town to run...

14:57.747 --> 15:01.082
that loves its summers.

15:01.751 --> 15:04.652
I can't afford any tourists.

15:04.887 --> 15:07.255
This is a small town.

15:07.322 --> 15:08.690
We need all the revenue we can
get.

15:08.758 --> 15:11.761
I understand that Mayor.
All I am saying is that, 2 days -

15:11.828 --> 15:15.698
- might not be enough time to
cull the entire population.

15:15.766 --> 15:17.900
I'll tell you what...

15:17.967 --> 15:21.036
You get this done, in 2 days...

15:21.104 --> 15:22.838
Scratch that...

15:22.906 --> 15:31.013
One day, I'll treat you and your family
to a fabulous steak dinner at Cobbs.

15:31.448 --> 15:32.348
You'll love it!

15:32.417 --> 15:34.718
Thick, Juicy...

15:35.653 --> 15:38.722
You're not a vegetarian, are
you?

15:38.790 --> 15:40.323
I don't want to offend your...

15:40.391 --> 15:43.694
Western sensibilities...

15:43.762 --> 15:46.731
No I'm not a vegetarian, But the
important issue here...

15:46.799 --> 15:49.534
- I have a town to run!
- OK... great chatting with you.

15:51.336 --> 15:54.171
Do you really think the lampreys
can get into Lake Michigan?

15:54.239 --> 15:57.643
It's possible if we don't get
this population under control.

15:57.710 --> 16:01.980
But that's 20,000 square miles!
That-That's insane, Will.

16:02.882 --> 16:07.319
Yeah. Look, let's get back to base.
We'll talk about this after lunch.

16:07.386 --> 16:08.854
Let's go.

16:46.829 --> 16:48.363
- Ready?
- Yeah.

16:48.430 --> 16:49.998
You're holding it wrong.

16:50.065 --> 16:51.967
I'm like the queen of selfies.

16:52.034 --> 16:54.268
Here you're majesty. Let me do
it.

16:57.807 --> 16:59.273
That's cold. That's cold.

16:59.341 --> 17:02.612
- You're such a jerk!
- Hey hey! That's freezing.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.680
Oh good. It turn out cute
though.

17:13.289 --> 17:14.991
Nicole!

17:15.058 --> 17:18.060
Hey Nicole!

17:19.296 --> 17:21.898
Hey Nicole!

17:45.223 --> 17:47.926
Are you lost, boy?
Or just hungry?

17:54.434 --> 17:56.068
What's your name, boy?

17:58.237 --> 17:59.939
Look at you, scootin' your butt.

18:00.006 --> 18:02.174
I'm gonna call you, Scooter.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.876
Come on boy!

18:10.150 --> 18:11.284
Hey Scooter!

18:19.860 --> 18:21.327
Is that your little brother?

18:22.463 --> 18:23.731
Oh yeah.

18:24.499 --> 18:25.700
Scooter!

18:27.936 --> 18:29.003
Scooter!

18:32.841 --> 18:34.208
He looks happy.

18:34.275 --> 18:35.442
Yeah...

18:36.044 --> 18:37.344
He's kind of a weird kid.

18:37.412 --> 18:40.148
- Really?
- Not like in a bad way or anything, but...

18:40.349 --> 18:42.017
He's just always by himself.

18:43.786 --> 18:46.955
He really looks up to my dad and stuff,
but my dad's like always gone. So...

18:47.156 --> 18:49.224
Doesn't he have any friends?

18:50.259 --> 18:52.094
- No?
- No.

18:52.495 --> 18:54.195
We just moved here.

18:54.998 --> 18:56.499
Scooter!

18:59.003 --> 19:00.302
I'll be his friend.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.303
Really?

19:01.371 --> 19:02.805
Heck yeah.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.440
I need a new fishing buddy.

19:04.508 --> 19:06.042
That's really sweet of you.

19:11.482 --> 19:12.850
Scooter?

19:13.118 --> 19:15.285
Scooter! Come here boy!

19:15.987 --> 19:19.089
Scooter!

19:19.457 --> 19:20.858
Kyle, you're ok?

19:20.925 --> 19:23.260
I can't find my stupid glasses.

19:23.327 --> 19:25.896
Hey don't worry little dude.
I'll find them.

19:26.097 --> 19:30.135
The dog I was playing with, Scooter.
I can't find him. He's hurt.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.269
Ok.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.271
Come on. We'll find him.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.839
You're hurt.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.909
Oh my god!

19:37.977 --> 19:39.210
You're all bloody!

19:39.411 --> 19:41.012
That is not my blood.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.214
Oh my god!

19:43.282 --> 19:45.317
It's fish guts.

19:48.055 --> 19:49.088
Alex!

19:49.289 --> 19:50.389
Get out of the water!

20:03.938 --> 20:05.271
- You found my glasses!
- Yeah!

20:05.339 --> 20:06.272
What about Scooter?

20:06.340 --> 20:08.008
No luck. Are you ok?

20:11.045 --> 20:12.645
Yeah. Yeah it's just fish guts.

20:12.714 --> 20:15.115
Barf. Barf. Ok Come on. Come on.

20:25.493 --> 20:26.660
Well,...

20:26.729 --> 20:28.596
...my gut is that without any
natural enemies,

20:28.663 --> 20:32.101
the Lampreys can get out of control.
But, there is a dam that separates Lake

20:32.168 --> 20:35.938
Charlevoix from the rivers. I think
we can contain them pretty easily.

20:36.005 --> 20:39.007
Well, that's a bit of good news.
But Lamprey's jump.

20:39.075 --> 20:40.642
Yeah, but not that high.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.577
How high is the wall?

20:42.645 --> 20:45.614
You know, it's different in
different places.

20:45.681 --> 20:49.652
Well, make sure that the water
levels are down by about 10 feet.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.420
Lampreys can't jump that high.

20:51.488 --> 20:55.992
Really? I have a hickey on the
back of my neck that says otherwise.

20:56.060 --> 20:57.961
They attack people?

20:58.028 --> 21:01.231
Certain species can be very aggressive.
If they run out of food in their area,

21:01.298 --> 21:04.534
they're going to look for blood
anyway they can.

21:05.036 --> 21:07.204
It's interesting. Ok?
Thanks.

21:07.272 --> 21:09.539
Sure. Just don't let them get
any further.

21:09.607 --> 21:12.176
Yeah will do. I'll talk to you
later.

21:23.756 --> 21:25.157
Hi Nicki!

21:25.224 --> 21:27.625
Dad! The craziest thing
just happened at the beach!

21:27.693 --> 21:30.128
There was fish blood all over my
legs, Dad!

21:30.196 --> 21:31.062
What's that?

21:31.130 --> 21:32.764
It was so gross.

21:32.832 --> 21:36.234
There were dead fish and
those Lamprey things in the water.

21:36.302 --> 21:37.736
Alright, how many of them were
there?

21:37.805 --> 21:40.039
I don't know. Like-like a lot.

21:40.107 --> 21:42.241
Sweetie I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

21:42.309 --> 21:45.477
Alright, we'll check
it out for you.

21:45.545 --> 21:48.480
Dad, can you come home?

21:48.548 --> 21:52.285
Awe, sweetheart I can't right
now.

21:52.352 --> 21:56.656
Look I know it was scary for
you, but they only go after fish, ok?

21:56.724 --> 21:59.726
They won't attack people unless
they're starving.

21:59.794 --> 22:01.394
But, Dad...

22:01.462 --> 22:05.398
Sweetie... I-I-I gotta go right
now. I'll be home later tonight.

22:05.466 --> 22:06.599
Ok.

22:07.902 --> 22:11.105
No-no. You're gonna be fine.
Trust me, ok? Bye.

22:12.607 --> 22:14.442
Hello?

22:20.182 --> 22:21.582
Thank you, sir.

22:23.452 --> 22:25.187
That was Mayor Akerman.

22:26.689 --> 22:28.324
He said that people have been
reporting a school of fish-

22:28.391 --> 22:31.426
Washed up a shore dead. Yeah, my
daughter just told me.

22:31.627 --> 22:35.030
Covered in bloody lesions.
That's...gotta be the Lamprey's, right?

22:35.098 --> 22:38.100
Well, I would assume so. But how
many Lampreys can be in the Lake?

22:38.168 --> 22:39.801
I don't know. I figured it was
just a handful.

22:39.870 --> 22:42.739
I thought our problem was with
the river infestation.

22:42.806 --> 22:45.108
Well either way, we're gonna have
to check out how they're slipping

22:45.176 --> 22:47.610
through the barriers
and the turbines.

22:47.678 --> 22:49.712
Rich will take care of it.

22:49.914 --> 22:51.547
- Rich!
- On it!

22:52.216 --> 22:53.416
Hey baby.

22:53.751 --> 22:55.785
Wanna go for a ride?

22:55.853 --> 22:57.188
No.

22:57.256 --> 22:58.689
Frigid.

23:00.359 --> 23:01.625
I should probably go with him.

23:01.693 --> 23:02.826
I want to see if the Lamprey
numbers are increasing.

23:02.895 --> 23:05.897
Don't worry about it. He'll
report back.

23:05.964 --> 23:07.402
Alright, he'll handle that.

23:07.403 --> 23:09.461
You and I need to see how
they're slipping through. Come on.

23:09.496 --> 23:10.902
Ok.

23:10.969 --> 23:13.538
Do you need me to go with
you?  I mean, go with you guys?

23:13.606 --> 23:16.375
No we're good.
Thank you, Marcy.

23:16.442 --> 23:18.043
Ok.

23:18.844 --> 23:20.212
Frigid.

23:22.248 --> 23:27.332
Mr. Expert, telling me what
to do.  Making me sit on a boat.

23:35.862 --> 23:39.198
Yep. They're getting through
alright.

23:39.266 --> 23:41.734
Operation rescue. Completed.

23:41.802 --> 23:43.202
Check.

23:44.771 --> 23:48.409
Operation cold one, is a go.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.116
Man!

24:22.579 --> 24:24.480
Where all the fish?

24:24.848 --> 24:26.849
The Lampreys must have gotten
them all.

24:30.553 --> 24:31.653
Oh my god.

24:34.359 --> 24:36.126
I've never seen that before.

24:37.462 --> 24:39.329
There's nothing left for them to
eat.

24:39.630 --> 24:42.265
They destroyed the entire eco
system.

24:42.867 --> 24:44.667
Or scared it away.

24:50.742 --> 24:52.276
They're coming right through.

24:52.344 --> 24:53.544
I don't get it.

24:55.014 --> 24:56.314
They're using their mouths like
suction cups to move the rocks.

24:56.382 --> 24:58.749
I've only ever seen them do that
when they build nests.

24:59.584 --> 25:01.719
That is desperate for food.

25:03.322 --> 25:06.492
A desperate Lamprey is a
dangerous Lamprey.

25:06.692 --> 25:09.461
I think they are doing the
exact same thing over there.

25:11.664 --> 25:13.765
At this rate, they are going to
tear a hole in the dam.

25:13.833 --> 25:15.867
We're going to have to rethink
our plan.

25:18.838 --> 25:20.472
That's Rich's boat.

25:22.410 --> 25:23.276
Yeah, Where's Rich?

25:25.279 --> 25:30.650
Hey...Hello? Hello? Got you.
Leave a message, this is Rich...

25:30.717 --> 25:32.752
Call's not going through.

25:34.655 --> 25:36.765
My sister dates a guy
that works at sanitation.

25:36.766 --> 25:39.265
He disappeared about a week ago.

25:39.694 --> 25:42.363
Yeah I heard about this, uh...

25:42.564 --> 25:44.532
Ted...something, right?

25:44.599 --> 25:47.968
Jorgenson. Yeah. At first everybody thought
he went to town to blow off some steam,

25:48.036 --> 25:51.838
but my sister insisted something
bad happened to him.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.307
Like what?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.909
I don't know.

25:54.977 --> 25:57.011
...but they found his truck.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.615
And they didn't find him.

26:00.683 --> 26:02.784
Alright, let get Rich's
boat.

26:10.025 --> 26:12.861
Is that blood?
Quick, grab the corner.

26:18.469 --> 26:19.868
Don't grab it! Don't grab it!

26:23.740 --> 26:25.508
Don't pull! Don't pull!

26:26.410 --> 26:27.811
Damn this thing is strong!

26:28.413 --> 26:29.446
Hold on!

26:31.782 --> 26:33.550
Hold still. Hold still.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.628
Son of a bitch!

26:45.697 --> 26:47.499
This is Will?

26:52.638 --> 26:54.239
They found Rich.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.874
They found his body.

27:18.633 --> 27:20.833
Oh Rich.

27:22.770 --> 27:25.639
What did they do to your face?

28:15.092 --> 28:16.125
Hello?

28:16.193 --> 28:18.861
Yeah hi, is this the Coroner's
office?

28:18.929 --> 28:20.931
Yes, this is Jim.

28:21.198 --> 28:24.473
Hi, this is Michael Parker
from Fish and Wildlife.

28:24.474 --> 28:26.796
You guys got a body in there
earlier with marks all over it.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.707
I need you no to
do anything with it until we get there.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.077
Hello?

28:37.850 --> 28:38.783
Hello?

28:51.797 --> 28:53.499
Hello?

29:01.207 --> 29:04.910
Yes, I have an emergency down at
the Coroner's office.

29:08.783 --> 29:11.618
Rich, what a way to
go.

29:16.658 --> 29:17.891
Poor guy.

29:19.694 --> 29:21.928
Right this way, Mayor.
Michael's waiting inside with the body.

29:24.064 --> 29:25.400
What the heck?

29:29.237 --> 29:31.606
Oh my god, Jim.

29:34.209 --> 29:36.744
What the hell is all over him?

29:36.812 --> 29:38.145
Lesions.

29:38.213 --> 29:39.180
From what?

29:39.247 --> 29:40.649
Lampreys.

29:40.717 --> 29:42.518
That's impossible.

29:42.752 --> 29:45.754
There's too many of them.
They're all over his body.

29:46.222 --> 29:48.190
How did they get in here?

29:48.257 --> 29:50.125
Rich was dead when he came in.

29:50.193 --> 29:54.496
So they were just feeding off of
him from the inside?

29:55.799 --> 29:56.866
Yeah.

29:58.902 --> 30:00.570
Mayor, we have to close the
Lake, Now!

30:00.638 --> 30:03.973
And that's just the start. We have
a much bigger issue at hand here.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.342
Bigger?

30:05.409 --> 30:08.177
I think the Lamprey that killed
him and the Coroner...

30:08.245 --> 30:10.547
crawled off and into the drain.

30:10.614 --> 30:11.848
Into the pipes!

30:11.915 --> 30:15.152
Yeah. You need to shut the water
system down, Now!

30:15.220 --> 30:16.687
Shut down the...

30:16.888 --> 30:18.088
What?!

30:19.324 --> 30:22.526
No. Even the
residents will leave.

30:22.594 --> 30:24.294
Look, I know I'm asking a lot
Mayor but-

30:24.363 --> 30:27.264
You want to shut down the water
system?

30:27.332 --> 30:31.702
because of a bunch of baby eels,
that will be dead in 2 hours?

30:31.871 --> 30:35.131
Lampreys live for over 14 years.

30:35.132 --> 30:39.089
They lay approximately
100,000 eggs at a time. Each.

30:39.124 --> 30:42.814
You do not want these creatures in
your pipes! Not even one of them!

30:44.817 --> 30:49.722
Let's go to my office, where we
can discuss our options...

30:50.824 --> 30:52.859
...in friendlier confines.

30:56.263 --> 30:57.630
Fine.

31:13.681 --> 31:15.849
How did so many get out
anyway?

31:15.917 --> 31:20.221
I though you said you could
contain this in just a day?

31:20.289 --> 31:24.158
No no, YOU said a day. I said I
needed more time.

31:24.226 --> 31:27.028
Now I need to do an accurate count of
the Lamprey. Otherwise we won't be able

31:27.095 --> 31:30.331
to contain the problem. It's gonna
take a few days. May be a week.

31:30.399 --> 31:32.099
I can't do a week.

31:32.167 --> 31:33.903
I need the time to do a survey
of the Lake.

31:33.970 --> 31:38.974
Look, Mr. Parker, I assure you that
safety is my number one priority.

31:39.042 --> 31:42.206
But I can't afford to lose
anymore tourist revenue.

31:42.207 --> 31:44.745
You're just not working fast enough!

31:45.014 --> 31:49.619
Those bites are just hickies.

31:51.722 --> 31:53.657
Does that look like a hickie to
you, Sir?

31:53.724 --> 31:54.991
Alright. Alright.

31:56.293 --> 31:58.194
Just listen to me just for a
second, Mayor, ok?

31:58.262 --> 32:00.816
These Lampreys are stronger

32:00.817 --> 32:03.291
and more aggressive then
any other that I've ever seen.

32:03.326 --> 32:05.335
The rate at which they can drain
blood is staggering!

32:08.874 --> 32:10.407
What? What is so funny?

32:10.476 --> 32:14.244
Have you ever eaten, Lampreys?

32:16.014 --> 32:17.615
They're not so bad.

32:17.816 --> 32:20.751
Chewy, like scallops.

32:20.819 --> 32:22.521
They love'em in Europe.

32:22.589 --> 32:28.259
Maybe that's a direction to explore.
Turn a negative into a positive.

32:28.327 --> 32:29.795
These Lampreys attached us-

32:29.863 --> 32:33.866
Nah nah nah nah. That's not
acceptable.

32:33.933 --> 32:38.605
Let's talk...solutions.

32:39.239 --> 32:40.874
Go.

32:41.341 --> 32:43.610
Alright.

32:48.415 --> 32:50.984
This is us, in
Charlevoix County, ok?

32:51.051 --> 32:53.319
Right? This is the dam on the
Jordan River.

32:53.387 --> 32:57.224
Now, they must be getting into the
pipes at the reservoir by the dam.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.160
If the continue to breach the dam,
they're gonna end up in Lake Charlevoix,

33:00.228 --> 33:02.935
From there they will be able
to easily jump over the barriers

33:02.936 --> 33:04.948
at Round Lake and Pine River...

33:04.983 --> 33:06.800
And then they are gonna end up
in Lake Michigan,

33:06.868 --> 33:09.870
Which it's gonna be next to
impossible to contain them.

33:09.938 --> 33:13.374
And they're gonna head over into
the canals, and onto the Mississippi.

33:13.442 --> 33:15.376
And we can't allow it to get to
that point.

33:15.444 --> 33:18.713
We have to close the river, the
Lake, and all public access to

33:18.781 --> 33:21.983
water until we can eradicate
this problem for good.

33:22.051 --> 33:24.697
We'll close the beaches
for the weekend

33:24.698 --> 33:27.941
and maybe the water pipes
for an hour or two.

33:28.792 --> 33:33.195
Work overtime to fix the dam and
gather up the last Lampreys from

33:33.263 --> 33:36.065
the Lakes and the water pipes.

33:36.132 --> 33:38.034
Are you insane?

33:38.101 --> 33:39.951
Rich and the Coroner are dead!

33:39.952 --> 33:42.872
And you're gonna tell people to stay
away from the waves for the weekend?

33:42.907 --> 33:45.475
And close the pipe
for an hour or two?

33:45.543 --> 33:50.580
These Lamprey are fast, they're strong,
and they're out for human blood!

33:50.647 --> 33:54.417
Now you need to call a press conference
and tell people to stay away from the water!

33:54.485 --> 33:56.486
Why haven't you tried poison?

33:56.554 --> 33:57.821
We did! It didn't work!

33:57.889 --> 34:01.158
Michael, I'm practically doing
your job for you.

34:01.226 --> 34:03.260
Poison only works on the
eggs.

34:03.328 --> 34:06.030
Well use more!

34:07.099 --> 34:08.967
Leave now.

34:09.467 --> 34:14.072
I'm going to work on
my...Lamprey recipes.

34:14.272 --> 34:15.841
Go go go.

34:23.416 --> 34:25.516
The Mayor's a jackass. We'll go
to press ourselves.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.252
I'm not endangering more lives.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.855
Fine. But um...

34:30.289 --> 34:32.492
I'm gonna be heading over to
Rich's house.

34:32.559 --> 34:34.560
So I can offer his family my
condolences.

34:34.629 --> 34:35.895
Ok.

34:37.364 --> 34:40.833
You outta call your own family.
Let them know you love them.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.400
Yeah, you're probably right.

34:42.469 --> 34:43.369
I'll see you later.

34:48.176 --> 34:49.744
Yeah hi, um...

34:49.812 --> 34:54.047
I need the number... actually can you
just connect me to Channel 6, please.

34:54.282 --> 34:56.083
Yeah, I'll hold.

34:57.819 --> 34:59.654
<i>Lamprey infestation has
escalated beyond our</i>

34:59.721 --> 35:04.860
<i>initial projections. We need to evacuate
the greater Lake Charlevoix area.</i>

35:04.927 --> 35:08.256
<i>The Lampreys we're dealing with are bigger,
stronger,</i>

35:08.257 --> 35:10.930
<i>and more deadly the Lampreys
we've known in the past.</i>

35:10.965 --> 35:14.449
<i>We advised you to stay away
from all fresh water sources.</i>

35:14.571 --> 35:17.187
<i>They can maneuver through

35:17.188 --> 35:19.640
<i>and on land with minimal moisture.</i>

35:19.675 --> 35:23.579
<i>Even you home tap. They've
contaminated water lines...</i>

35:23.646 --> 35:27.416
Hey Michael, I'm returning your
call and listening to you on TV.

35:28.451 --> 35:31.187
...and you're here.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.221
What happened?

35:32.289 --> 35:35.525
Long story. Where's Kyle's
Lamprey?

35:35.593 --> 35:36.894
I don't know.

35:36.961 --> 35:40.164
We have to find it. Kyle! Can
you get in here please!

35:45.603 --> 35:47.337
What's going on?

36:01.453 --> 36:04.089
<i>And the Department of Fish and
Wildlife will be working around</i>

36:04.156 --> 36:09.228
<i>the clock to rid the waterways of

36:09.295 --> 36:11.693
<i>Please be adviced

<i>fresh water sources.

36:14.601 --> 36:19.137
<i>Look, these-these Lampreys are
hungry, and they're dangerous.</i>

36:19.205 --> 36:21.312
<i>And if that means that you need to...</i>

36:21.313 --> 36:24.672
<i>vacation somewhere else
for the summer, and so be it.</i>

36:24.707 --> 36:25.879
Dammit!

36:28.382 --> 36:31.284
Good Afternoon. You've reached
the department of Fish and Wildlife.

36:31.352 --> 36:33.053
Yes, I'd like to speak to Josh
Friedman.

36:33.121 --> 36:36.123
Hello Mayor. I'm afraid
he's not in the office right now.

36:36.190 --> 36:38.992
Have him call me once he gets
in, Thank you.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.330
That's-That's all I have.

36:53.242 --> 36:55.143
And that man Rich, he's still
missing?

36:55.210 --> 36:56.611
No, he's dead.

36:56.679 --> 36:59.047
Mom! Dad! Where's my
Lamprey?

36:59.115 --> 37:00.916
Hey buddy.

37:00.984 --> 37:04.987
Listen, you understand the second that
we find it, we have to kill it, right?

37:05.054 --> 37:06.454
Dad, No! I like it!

37:06.522 --> 37:08.423
I know you do, son...but we
don't have any other choice.

37:08.491 --> 37:10.458
Go look for it, ok?

37:10.660 --> 37:14.197
This is getting way to
dangerous.

37:14.265 --> 37:17.433
I want you all out of here tonight.
I booked you tickets already.

37:17.501 --> 37:19.002
Wait a second, we haven't even
talked about this.

37:19.069 --> 37:22.172
I know Cate, I'm getting a bad f
- Found it!

37:27.611 --> 37:29.379
Where's the Lamprey?

37:31.349 --> 37:33.117
I killed it in the garbage disposal.

37:33.185 --> 37:35.186
Good. Good Job.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.687
Isn't leaving a little extreme?

37:36.754 --> 37:39.690
Cate, I've never seen anything
like this before.

37:46.065 --> 37:47.999
Good job buddy.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.273
Nicole, pack your stu-

37:56.508 --> 37:57.508
What's going on here?

37:57.576 --> 37:59.610
Hello Mr. parker...I'm
Alex.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.448
Well Alex, what the hell are you
doing in my daughter's bedroom?

38:02.515 --> 38:04.250
Dad, stop it.

38:04.318 --> 38:07.353
I told her that he can come over but she
wasn't supposed to have the door closed.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.088
We're not even doing anything.

38:09.156 --> 38:11.090
Not yet, you don't know how guys
think.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.059
- You! out! Now!
- Yes, sir.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.426
Alex wait.

38:14.494 --> 38:15.728
No no no, there's no waiting.
There's just going.

38:15.795 --> 38:18.565
You took away all my friends for
the entire summer.

38:18.632 --> 38:21.101
Excuse me for wanting a social
life!

38:21.169 --> 38:22.569
Just pack your stuff. You're
leaving.

38:22.636 --> 38:24.371
That's not fair!

38:24.438 --> 38:28.808
Nicole, you wanted to be back with
your friends...you got your wish, ok?

38:28.877 --> 38:29.709
Well Alex and I-

38:29.777 --> 38:31.711
Just met!

38:33.515 --> 38:34.682
Now I don't have time to get into this
with you, just do as I say. Please!

38:34.750 --> 38:37.551
- You're the worst Dad!
- Yeah yeah yeah I know.

38:37.619 --> 38:40.088
I freakin' hate you!

38:41.656 --> 38:45.226
It would have been nice if you PRETENDED
to want my input on any of this.

38:45.294 --> 38:46.727
Cate, you don't understand-

38:53.469 --> 38:55.637
It's Will, I have to take it.

38:56.273 --> 38:57.406
Of course you do.

38:58.108 --> 38:59.508
Cate, come...

39:01.311 --> 39:02.778
Come here.

39:04.714 --> 39:06.249
Will, talk to me.

39:06.317 --> 39:07.550
Michael.

39:07.618 --> 39:09.152
There's too many.

39:09.220 --> 39:11.687
They're coming through the
turbines, right over the barriers.

39:11.755 --> 39:14.124
Straight into Lake Charlevoix.

39:16.894 --> 39:18.728
Alright, uh...

39:18.796 --> 39:20.363
I'll be right over.

39:20.431 --> 39:22.400
Please hurry.

39:43.957 --> 39:46.424
There you are! Now keep
quiet and don't move.

39:46.492 --> 39:48.660
My parent's think I put you in
the garbage disposal.

39:50.529 --> 39:55.435
I know. I know. I'm sorry baby.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.438
I'm sorry. It's gonna be ok.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.442
Cate?

40:05.446 --> 40:08.614
Look, I gotta go.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.186
I'm...

40:14.856 --> 40:17.524
...I'll fill you in the details
later.

40:28.437 --> 40:30.305
You need food.

40:48.591 --> 40:50.893
I can't believe my stupid dad.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.529
He's always just trying
to control my life.

40:53.596 --> 40:55.931
Yeah your dad is totally
just bugging out.

40:55.999 --> 40:58.335
I mean, it's just a few
Lampreys.

40:58.569 --> 41:00.937
He is totally geeking out.

41:01.005 --> 41:02.805
I know...

41:02.873 --> 41:05.509
I can't believe he's making you
leave.

41:05.576 --> 41:07.844
You know, I'm not going!
Alright?

41:08.046 --> 41:11.248
This is my life, not his.

41:11.449 --> 41:13.283
He can't tell me what to do!

41:15.487 --> 41:18.322
Oh hey hold on Nicole I gotta take this,
but I promise I'll call you right back.

41:18.390 --> 41:19.790
Mr. Pools Pool cleaning?

41:19.858 --> 41:22.726
Hi Alex it's Ellen, how are you?

41:22.794 --> 41:24.195
Hey Ms. Ellen what's up?

41:24.263 --> 41:27.932
So there is a problem in my
pool. It's kind of an emergency

41:27.999 --> 41:31.803
and I was hoping that you
could come over and fix it.

41:31.871 --> 41:33.605
Sure, I'm on my way.

41:33.673 --> 41:38.810
Ok great! Also, I'm actually not gonna
be here but I might be back later.

41:38.878 --> 41:40.345
Yeah, that sounds great.

41:40.413 --> 41:42.881
Ok. Alright. Great.

41:42.949 --> 41:44.783
I'll talk to you soon.

41:51.925 --> 41:53.059
Hey Nicole.

41:53.127 --> 41:56.629
Hey listen. Why don't I come
pick you up?

41:56.697 --> 42:00.633
Ms. Ellen, this lady, I clean her pool,
she's gonna be stepping out for a bit...

42:00.701 --> 42:03.537
So we can have the whole place
all to ourselves for a swim.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.839
That sounds great. I'll
meet you there.

42:10.412 --> 42:14.648
I hope you like Cabernet, Alex.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.667
What the heck?

42:40.511 --> 42:42.978
Ok, the flight is for this
evening. So we have to hurry.

42:43.046 --> 42:44.447
Can I stay with Dad?

42:44.515 --> 42:45.615
Absolutely not.

42:45.682 --> 42:47.883
But Dad promised me I could stay
with him.

42:47.951 --> 42:50.586
Kyle, please stop.

42:50.855 --> 42:53.089
I made friends with a dog
at the Lake today.

42:53.158 --> 42:54.358
Can I go to the beach?

42:54.425 --> 42:56.726
What? No! The water is filled
with Lampreys.

42:56.794 --> 42:58.695
But Dad says they're harmless.

42:58.763 --> 43:01.431
Yeah, well now Dad says
different.

43:01.499 --> 43:03.667
Are you calling Dad a liar?

43:03.734 --> 43:05.135
Really?

43:05.203 --> 43:08.739
Please, mom? The dog is my
only friend and he needs me.

43:09.175 --> 43:11.409
Nobody likes me.

43:11.477 --> 43:13.678
I'm just a kid that nobody
likes.

43:13.745 --> 43:14.912
Get use to it.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.548
Oh baby.

43:16.615 --> 43:18.416
Everybody likes you.

43:18.484 --> 43:20.718
I really like you.

43:22.688 --> 43:24.590
I love you.

43:24.658 --> 43:25.691
I love you too.

43:25.758 --> 43:29.428
I don't think I can hear
you.

43:29.496 --> 43:30.396
What?

43:30.463 --> 43:31.197
I love you.

43:31.264 --> 43:32.030
What?

43:32.098 --> 43:32.898
I love you.

43:32.965 --> 43:34.700
One more time.

43:34.767 --> 43:35.901
I love you too.

43:35.968 --> 43:36.835
I love you.

43:36.903 --> 43:39.806
You're so amazing.

43:41.842 --> 43:44.944
Yeah she's cool with it.
I come over here all the time.

43:46.447 --> 43:48.147
You know, we could have just
gone to the beach.

43:48.216 --> 43:50.750
No way. I'm not swimming in fish
pee.

43:53.921 --> 43:55.823
Stop.

43:56.024 --> 43:57.358
Come on you woos.

43:57.559 --> 43:59.327
She's not here. Trust me.

43:59.661 --> 44:01.495
She's just...old.

44:01.563 --> 44:03.331
She's literally like 30.

44:04.633 --> 44:06.033
Hello?

44:06.101 --> 44:07.635
Ms. Ellen?

44:08.870 --> 44:10.104
See.

44:10.171 --> 44:13.408
- Nobody's here. - Ok.
- Just to ourselves.

44:18.013 --> 44:19.748
Ha! Who's a sissy now?

44:20.750 --> 44:21.850
It's on.

44:38.469 --> 44:41.137
Nicole, are you packed yet?

44:41.204 --> 44:43.673
Nicole, are you packed?

44:43.741 --> 44:45.609
Nicole?

44:52.584 --> 44:54.851
Kyle, have you seen your sister?

45:08.601 --> 45:10.368
Oh my god.

45:10.436 --> 45:13.471
Hey, it's Nicole. Don't leave a
message, just text me.

45:13.539 --> 45:15.907
Hey Nicole, it's me. Where are
you?

45:36.096 --> 45:37.698
Nicole?!

46:07.964 --> 46:08.964
Get out of there!

46:11.901 --> 46:13.836
Call the police! Call the
police!

46:19.175 --> 46:20.577
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

46:22.913 --> 46:25.181
9-1-1, what's the emergency?

46:36.627 --> 46:38.596
- They're all running away.
- Yeah.

46:38.663 --> 46:44.234
The theory is that, the smell of their own
dead repels them. Signals something's wrong.

46:45.103 --> 46:46.737
Now, let's get out of here.

46:53.813 --> 46:55.580
Now, you two work on repairing
the holes.

46:55.648 --> 46:59.618
I'll wrangle the Lampreys to a designated
area and we can shock them there.

46:59.685 --> 47:02.587
Oh! Is that the Mayor?

47:05.157 --> 47:06.958
You! Michael!

47:07.860 --> 47:09.862
Out! Now!

47:09.930 --> 47:11.096
Excuse me?

47:11.164 --> 47:12.632
You heard me!

47:12.699 --> 47:14.567
Fired!

47:15.936 --> 47:20.205
Your press conference scared off
the whole town!

47:20.273 --> 47:23.943
Your plans are slow, and they
don't work!

47:24.010 --> 47:27.714
Well I'm sorry but you can't fire
me. I report to US Fish and Wildlife.

47:27.782 --> 47:33.654
To Josh Friedman? Ha! He agrees
with me. You're out!

47:33.721 --> 47:36.657
Mayor, you're making a big mistake here.
You don't understand what's at stake.

47:36.724 --> 47:42.664
If you don't leave now, you'll be in
breach of several trespassing laws.

47:42.731 --> 47:47.001
All which carry hefty fines and
jail time.

47:47.069 --> 47:48.035
Sir, seriously-

47:48.103 --> 47:50.204
No no no. It's ok.

47:53.308 --> 47:55.009
That's fine then.

47:55.077 --> 47:56.644
Suit yourself.

47:56.712 --> 47:58.881
Good luck Mayor. You're gonna
need it.

47:59.182 --> 48:01.016
Michael...wait!

48:02.251 --> 48:03.519
Sir, Seriously-

48:03.587 --> 48:07.990
Will, I trust everything will be
under control soon?

48:08.057 --> 48:11.660
- Yes, but we have so much-
- Mayor! - Sounds good!

48:20.004 --> 48:22.772
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

48:29.380 --> 48:31.849
Call Cate.

48:31.917 --> 48:33.784
Hey, you've reached Cate Parker.
I can't get to the phone

48:33.852 --> 48:35.920
right now. So leave a message.

48:35.988 --> 48:37.388
Cate...

48:37.455 --> 48:39.056
You're not gonna believe this.

48:39.124 --> 48:41.358
That son of a bitch Mayor fired
me.

48:41.426 --> 48:43.961
I'm taking the next flight out.

48:44.162 --> 48:47.265
I hope you all are on the flight
already. Um...

48:47.333 --> 48:51.003
Look, um um sorry about before.
Call me when you land.

48:51.070 --> 48:53.071
I love you...

48:57.443 --> 48:58.844
Cate?

48:58.912 --> 49:00.178
Michael, it's Will.

49:00.246 --> 49:02.381
The Lampreys have completely
broken through the dam.

49:02.449 --> 49:04.717
I need your help. Please.
Can you-

49:04.785 --> 49:06.553
Will, you heard the Mayor. I
can't do anything.

49:06.620 --> 49:10.222
Michael, if Lake Charlevoix gets
infested, I'll pass over to Lake Michigan.

49:10.290 --> 49:12.324
Then it's gonna go through every
waterway in America.

49:12.392 --> 49:14.994
This is a problem we have to
stop, now!

49:15.062 --> 49:16.763
Awe, screw it.

49:16.830 --> 49:18.899
Alright, I'm on my way.

49:27.542 --> 49:30.744
- Call channel 6 News...
- Channel 6 Station News?

49:30.812 --> 49:32.245
Hello, this is Michael parker.

49:32.313 --> 49:34.816
I want to call another press
conference.

49:47.597 --> 49:50.399
Sick! Sick!

49:52.268 --> 49:54.937
Someone help!

49:57.107 --> 49:58.808
Scooter!

50:01.144 --> 50:02.311
Scooter!

50:02.378 --> 50:04.146
Where you going?

50:21.298 --> 50:24.368
<i>Hello, Michael Parker
from Fish and Wildlife here again.</i>

50:24.436 --> 50:28.439
<i>The Lamprey infestation has escalated
beyond our initial projections.</i>

50:28.507 --> 50:31.308
<i>We need to evacuate the greater
Lake Charlevoix area.</i>

50:31.376 --> 50:34.311
<i>The Lampreys were dealing with
are bigger, stronger, and more</i>

50:34.379 --> 50:37.181
<i>deadly than the Lampreys we've
known in the past.</i>

50:37.249 --> 50:40.585
<i>We advise you to stay away from
all fresh water sources.</i>

50:40.754 --> 50:43.564
<i>They can maneuver through
shallow depths of water</i>

50:43.565 --> 50:45.638
<i>and on land with minimal moisture.</i>

50:46.073 --> 50:47.959
Even your home tap.

50:47.961 --> 50:50.262
<i>They have contaminated
water lines throughout</i>

50:50.329 --> 50:53.866
<i>the county and are
a deadly threat to all life.</i>

50:53.933 --> 50:59.560
These Lampreys... they're hungry,
determined, and they're dangerous.

51:25.366 --> 51:26.767
We gotta get out of here, now.

51:26.835 --> 51:30.005
We'll figure out a new game plan
when we get to somewhere safer.

51:33.576 --> 51:35.877
There's just too many of them.

53:19.487 --> 53:20.655
Marcy, go check the school

53:20.723 --> 53:23.491
playing fields and see what
the damage is.

53:23.559 --> 53:25.027
Will do.

53:33.536 --> 53:35.470
Call Cate.

53:35.538 --> 53:36.973
<i>Hey, you've reached Cate Parker.</i>

53:37.041 --> 53:39.142
<i>I can't get to the phone right
now, so leave a message.</i>

53:39.210 --> 53:40.676
Dammit.

53:40.744 --> 53:43.479
Call Nicole.

53:43.547 --> 53:46.615
Hey it's Nicole. Don't leave a
message, just text me.

53:46.683 --> 53:50.353
Hey Nicole it's Dad, are you
guys on the plane?

53:50.554 --> 53:51.721
Call me when you land.

53:51.788 --> 53:53.690
Everything ok?

53:53.758 --> 53:58.662
Yeah yeah. It should be fine. I just got a
funny feeling. It's the second time I call.

54:05.103 --> 54:06.770
Masses of Lampreys have been
sighted heading north to the

54:06.838 --> 54:11.276
lake Charlevoix school playing
fields. All units please be aware.

54:11.344 --> 54:14.012
Call Marcy, make sure
she's hearing this.

54:31.731 --> 54:32.631
Yeah?

54:32.699 --> 54:33.665
Are you ok?

54:33.733 --> 54:35.401
No I'm fine, but...

54:36.203 --> 54:38.104
Can you see the Lampreys?

54:38.305 --> 54:41.408
Yeah, and there are
hundreds of them.

54:41.609 --> 54:44.011
Marcy, you need to get out of
there.

54:48.216 --> 54:50.650
Marcy! Hang in there.

54:53.187 --> 54:55.289
Get out!

54:58.394 --> 55:00.561
Marcy!

55:12.541 --> 55:14.343
Stop! Stop! Stop!

55:19.215 --> 55:20.349
Will!

55:21.818 --> 55:23.419
Marcy! get out of the car!
- Will!

55:23.486 --> 55:25.254
Get out of the car now!

55:25.322 --> 55:26.221
Get out!

55:30.794 --> 55:32.295
Get out of the car!

55:53.285 --> 55:55.119
Will...

55:55.354 --> 55:57.754
You would have been
killed.

56:01.361 --> 56:02.794
I'm sorry.

56:05.231 --> 56:06.231
I'm sorry.

56:07.967 --> 56:10.668
Look, we need to get back into
town, get a map of the water system

56:10.736 --> 56:14.106
and see where these things are
fanning out to so we can stop'em.

56:15.808 --> 56:17.309
You'll be ok?

56:18.312 --> 56:19.712
I'm sorry..

56:31.758 --> 56:33.459
We're arriving at the
house now.

56:41.002 --> 56:42.102
Where's the body?

56:42.170 --> 56:45.705
Right there. There's Lampreys in
the pool.

57:00.622 --> 57:02.490
What is going on?

57:02.558 --> 57:06.162
They're leaving. Everybody's getting out
of here! Kyle's all by himself! Come on!

57:10.434 --> 57:11.233
Kyle!

57:11.301 --> 57:13.635
- Kyle!
- Nicole wait.

57:15.505 --> 57:19.275
You go. I have to make sure my
family's ok.

57:24.048 --> 57:25.782
Be safe.

57:33.458 --> 57:34.257
Mom?

57:34.325 --> 57:35.525
Nicole?

57:35.593 --> 57:36.726
Kyle? I can hear you!

57:36.794 --> 57:37.961
- Mom!
- Are you in the bathroom?

57:38.028 --> 57:42.800
I'm up here! I'm in the attic!
I'm up here!

57:50.409 --> 57:52.610
Kyle, where are you?

58:05.891 --> 58:07.259
Mom?

58:07.327 --> 58:11.397
I'm in the bathroom,
Nicole. Stay where you are!

58:13.000 --> 58:15.701
Where's Kyle? Is he ok?

58:17.037 --> 58:18.538
Mom!

58:22.109 --> 58:23.409
Mom!

58:27.549 --> 58:28.949
Run!

58:29.017 --> 58:34.255
Go! Get out of here! Go
find your brother! Please.

58:38.860 --> 58:40.027
Oh god no!

58:40.094 --> 58:41.795
Get out of here!

58:41.863 --> 58:42.396
No!

58:42.464 --> 58:43.398
Nicole! Go!

58:43.466 --> 58:47.335
- No way! - Go
Nicole! - No!

58:49.938 --> 58:51.973
Nicole just go!

58:53.676 --> 58:55.189
There's too many of them!

58:55.190 --> 58:58.142
Listen to me, I need you to
go find your brother! Please go!

58:58.246 --> 59:00.283
Nicole! Go!
- No way!

59:03.587 --> 59:04.853
Here!

59:23.908 --> 59:25.375
Come on!

59:31.183 --> 59:31.982
What about Kyle?

59:32.050 --> 59:34.018
He wasn't in there! Where is he?

59:38.591 --> 59:41.792
- Nicole! Are you alright?
- I'm ok! I'm ok!

59:48.568 --> 59:49.768
Mom?

59:50.503 --> 59:54.506
Mom! Help! Help! Help!

59:54.574 --> 59:57.976
Earlier he said that he
wanted to go to the beach.

59:58.044 --> 01:00:00.879
Scooter. Scooter! It's this dumb dog
he met down there. Let's go there!

01:00:00.947 --> 01:00:03.750
No! You're not going alright?
You cannot go. It's too dangerous.

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:06.353
There's Lampreys everywhere.

01:00:06.554 --> 01:00:09.489
You'll be safe here. There's no
sewer or water pipes.

01:00:09.557 --> 01:00:10.757
Be careful.

01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:12.058
I love you.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.360
I love you.

01:00:13.561 --> 01:00:14.861
I can't loose you.

01:00:16.096 --> 01:00:16.929
Go!

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.449
It looks like a ghost town.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:09.620
Yeah. I guess the press
conferences worked.

01:01:20.898 --> 01:01:23.534
So what are we doing here?

01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:24.803
Well...

01:01:25.339 --> 01:01:27.251
We need to get the
Lampreys all in one place.

01:01:27.252 --> 01:01:29.577
So we can generate
a powerful enough current.

01:01:29.612 --> 01:01:32.844
But I need the city plans to find out
where. I'm assuming Akerman has them.

01:01:32.911 --> 01:01:35.613
I'm sure he split town by now.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.817
Crap.

01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:42.287
- Alright, well let's just go.
- No no no no.

01:01:42.356 --> 01:01:45.658
I always keep something
on me for the occasions.

01:01:46.092 --> 01:01:47.993
- Viola.
- Really?

01:01:52.766 --> 01:01:54.233
Kyle!

01:01:55.669 --> 01:01:57.170
Kyle!

01:02:04.879 --> 01:02:05.979
Kyle.

01:02:06.046 --> 01:02:11.017
Kyle!

01:02:45.055 --> 01:02:47.690
What the hell's going on?
There's blood all over the place.

01:02:47.758 --> 01:02:48.925
- Grab the map.
- Right.

01:02:48.992 --> 01:02:51.961
It should be in his desk.

01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:57.634
- It's coming from the bathroom.
- I've got it!

01:02:57.701 --> 01:03:00.771
- I've got the map.
- Akerman? Akerman?

01:03:04.943 --> 01:03:06.777
Oh my god! Close the door!

01:03:07.378 --> 01:03:08.512
What's the noise?

01:03:11.215 --> 01:03:13.050
They're breaking
through the pipes.

01:03:15.954 --> 01:03:17.722
Will! Will! Will!

01:03:35.108 --> 01:03:37.076
Come on! Let's get out of here!

01:03:40.881 --> 01:03:42.181
Get it off!

01:03:50.024 --> 01:03:52.092
- You ok?
- Yeah yeah. I'm good. Thanks!

01:03:52.159 --> 01:03:53.961
Let's get out of here.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.177
So...

01:04:10.245 --> 01:04:13.781
What's... What's the plan with
the...

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:17.251
maps that we almost died
getting? What are we...

01:04:17.319 --> 01:04:19.416
We got to get to public works.

01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:23.305
Shut the water system down.
Limit their access to the town.

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:26.061
It's worth a shot.

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:54.224
This is the middle of dry land,
the center of the town. It's insane.

01:05:15.882 --> 01:05:17.282
Come on!

01:05:31.899 --> 01:05:33.399
What is it?

01:05:34.267 --> 01:05:35.835
I'm just...

01:05:37.504 --> 01:05:39.438
I just hope my family's ok.

01:05:47.215 --> 01:05:49.850
Mom!

01:06:22.285 --> 01:06:24.854
Help! Mom! Help!

01:06:28.992 --> 01:06:30.225
Help!

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.996
Help! Mom!

01:06:38.335 --> 01:06:39.136
Hello?

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:40.837
Nicole, sweetie are you ok?

01:06:40.905 --> 01:06:44.041
I'm home alone in the yard. I
don't know where mom or Kyle are.

01:06:44.108 --> 01:06:46.878
Alright, I'm coming home to get
you. Can you hold off till I get there?

01:06:46.945 --> 01:06:50.314
Yep! Dad! Please please hurry!

01:06:54.586 --> 01:06:56.387
Nicole!

01:07:06.199 --> 01:07:08.300
Dad's on his way.

01:07:10.536 --> 01:07:11.336
Kyle?

01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:13.238
I don't know where he is.

01:07:29.957 --> 01:07:32.859
Burn them all mom. Burn them
all.

01:07:37.199 --> 01:07:39.433
Help!

01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:44.138
Help!

01:07:49.477 --> 01:07:51.213
It's working mom. They're
leaving.

01:08:02.558 --> 01:08:04.993
Help!

01:08:06.528 --> 01:08:07.563
Dad!

01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:09.165
- I'm so glad you're ok!
- You came.

01:08:11.401 --> 01:08:12.568
Where's Kyle?

01:08:15.172 --> 01:08:19.041
I don't know. I found his
bloody jacket at the beach.

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:22.444
No! No! Oh my god! No!

01:08:24.415 --> 01:08:26.616
I should've listened to you.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.167
Guys!

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:43.600
Look!

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:47.470
It's Kyle!
Kyle!

01:08:47.538 --> 01:08:49.573
I can hear you! Hurry!

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.410
- Kyle! Wait a second Cate!
- Kyle!

01:08:54.446 --> 01:08:55.446
Kyle!

01:08:56.283 --> 01:08:57.249
Cate!

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.285
Cate! No no no you can't go in!

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.553
Cate! Wait wait!

01:09:03.356 --> 01:09:04.423
Listen! Listen!

01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:06.292
- Don't worry we'll get to him.
- Kyle!

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.593
- If he's in the attic he's in
the safest place. He can be, ok?

01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:10.595
We'll get to him. We'll get to
him.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.200
Kyle! We're coming!

01:09:14.202 --> 01:09:15.535
Kyle, can you hear us?

01:09:15.602 --> 01:09:18.071
I can hear you! Hurry!

01:09:18.505 --> 01:09:21.107
Dammit!

01:09:21.175 --> 01:09:22.341
Kyle!

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.010
- Is there a ladder in your truck?
- No.

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:25.444
What about the truck itself?

01:09:25.511 --> 01:09:26.679
It won't be tall enough.

01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:29.515
Nicole, did you see a ladder in
the tool shed?

01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:33.587
Alex! He'll be here any second.
He's got a ladder in the back of his truck.

01:09:33.822 --> 01:09:35.323
Kyle?

01:09:40.428 --> 01:09:42.229
I can't turn off the water.

01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:43.331
The valve is stuck.

01:09:53.676 --> 01:09:54.709
Your family?

01:09:54.777 --> 01:09:56.111
They left town already.

01:09:56.179 --> 01:09:57.545
Why didn't you go with them?

01:09:57.613 --> 01:09:59.981
Thanks for coming Allen, you
have a ladder in your car?

01:10:00.048 --> 01:10:01.374
Yeah, it's in the back
of the truck actually.

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:02.840
- Ok. Good.
Dad, it's Alex.

01:10:02.846 --> 01:10:05.388
Alec, Alex! Go help him shut
off the water.  We'll get Kyle.

01:10:05.456 --> 01:10:07.090
Hey hey Will! You need a hand
with that?

01:10:07.157 --> 01:10:08.691
Yeah Alex, do you have any
pliers?

01:10:08.759 --> 01:10:11.294
Pliers! pliers! I got some
actually. One sec.

01:10:15.599 --> 01:10:16.633
Let's see man.

01:10:17.269 --> 01:10:18.735
- Right here.
- Wait wait wait.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.308
Alright. Let's go.

01:10:24.376 --> 01:10:27.077
No, I'm going. I already lost him
once. I need you to watch Nicole.

01:10:27.145 --> 01:10:28.512
- Here.
- Alright.

01:10:30.315 --> 01:10:31.581
Be careful, Cate.

01:10:31.649 --> 01:10:33.285
Kyle, I'm coming!

01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:42.260
Michael. Nicole. Behind you.
Lampreys.

01:10:42.594 --> 01:10:43.661
Nico-

01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:46.097
- Mom! Mom Help!
- Hang on Kyle!

01:10:46.165 --> 01:10:49.368
- Wait wait wait.
- Come on!

01:10:49.769 --> 01:10:52.204
- Pull it back! Come on!

01:10:52.272 --> 01:10:53.539
It's stuck!

01:10:59.512 --> 01:11:01.147
I'm going to break the window.

01:11:01.214 --> 01:11:04.717
Mom! Mom!

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.735
Kyle baby! Take my hands.

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:24.672
You did it!

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.075
Yeah. You did it!

01:11:39.489 --> 01:11:40.522
Oh god.

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:44.326
No! No! Don't pull. Dad showed
me how.

01:11:48.764 --> 01:11:49.831
Is he ok?

01:11:49.899 --> 01:11:51.633
Yeah, he's ok!

01:11:51.701 --> 01:11:53.769
Alright You have to go down the
ladder. You ready? Ok.

01:11:56.607 --> 01:11:57.840
You're so brave.

01:12:01.645 --> 01:12:04.647
- Kyle!
- No Dad!

01:12:05.749 --> 01:12:07.550
Carefully. Careful.

01:12:11.023 --> 01:12:11.822
Dad!

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:14.791
Kyle! I'm so glad you're ok.

01:12:15.793 --> 01:12:17.728
You scared us.

01:12:23.568 --> 01:12:25.603
Cate! Cate!

01:12:27.806 --> 01:12:29.541
It's my ribs.

01:12:31.411 --> 01:12:32.644
I'll be fine.

01:12:32.711 --> 01:12:33.912
Good job buddy.

01:12:33.979 --> 01:12:35.380
We gotta go.

01:12:35.448 --> 01:12:36.681
Let's go.

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:38.283
Guys.

01:12:44.324 --> 01:12:47.626
Ok so we get to the public works. We
turn off the water and then-and then what?

01:12:47.694 --> 01:12:49.462
Are we heading back to the dam?

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.830
I thought that at first. Now I'm thinking
we can use the water to our advantage.

01:12:51.898 --> 01:12:53.699
Cause we gotta get them all in
one place.

01:12:53.767 --> 01:12:55.268
Somewhere with a reservoir.

01:12:55.335 --> 01:12:56.569
Are we going with you?

01:12:56.636 --> 01:12:59.373
I need to see you all safe
before Will and I leave,

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.108
Dad! No!

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:04.478
Son it's ok. We're going to take
you somewhere where you'll be safe.

01:13:06.681 --> 01:13:07.647
There.

01:13:09.117 --> 01:13:11.251
We'll be safe here.
There are no water pipes around

01:13:11.319 --> 01:13:12.953
and it's a high vantage point,

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:17.692
water runs downhill so you'll see
the Lampreys before they see you.

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:32.508
- Are you ok, sweetie?
- Yeah I'll be fine.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.820
Watch out!

01:13:49.059 --> 01:13:50.960
Stay back! It's live!

01:13:58.068 --> 01:14:00.570
We gotta get to the power
station. I've got an idea.

01:14:09.414 --> 01:14:10.714
In here.

01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:13.050
So it's like your stunboat, only
on a massive scale.

01:14:13.118 --> 01:14:14.619
Exactly.

01:14:16.255 --> 01:14:17.988
But how are we going to attract
all the Lampreys to one location?

01:14:18.056 --> 01:14:19.591
Bio salts.

01:14:19.659 --> 01:14:20.825
Bio salts?

01:14:20.893 --> 01:14:24.029
They're secreted by the liver.
To tract a mate.

01:14:24.096 --> 01:14:24.996
That could work.

01:14:25.064 --> 01:14:26.498
Exactly.

01:14:26.566 --> 01:14:28.367
Alright everyone, look...

01:14:28.434 --> 01:14:30.269
We're going to get the livers
from the dead Lampreys.

01:14:30.336 --> 01:14:34.072
Will and I are going to use them to draw
the live Lampreys, through the reservoir...

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.676
into the power station, where
we're going to electrocute them.

01:14:36.743 --> 01:14:38.711
Alright. We're not separating
again.

01:14:38.779 --> 01:14:40.413
I want to help.

01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:42.348
Us, too.

01:14:43.684 --> 01:14:45.785
Of course, I couldn't do it
without you.

01:14:46.187 --> 01:14:47.687
Now let's get to work.

01:14:51.726 --> 01:14:53.360
Here's what they look like
buddy.

01:15:00.935 --> 01:15:03.441
Keep these on you.  They'll
keep the live ones away.

01:15:03.442 --> 01:15:06.427
For a little while anyway.
Come on.  Let's go.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.381
Everyone get in the truck.

01:15:26.496 --> 01:15:28.764
The smell is attracting them.
It's working.

01:15:35.539 --> 01:15:37.840
Something's got me!

01:15:40.978 --> 01:15:45.915
Get them off! Get them off!

01:15:52.223 --> 01:15:53.957
Don't move!

01:15:54.191 --> 01:15:55.926
Get them off! Get them off!

01:16:01.267 --> 01:16:04.201
Oh my god! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:06.203
No! Stay here!

01:16:09.575 --> 01:16:11.610
- Oh my god. I'm sorry!
- It's ok. I'm ok.

01:16:11.678 --> 01:16:12.944
Are you ok?

01:16:13.012 --> 01:16:14.480
We need to go. Just go!

01:16:14.547 --> 01:16:15.681
Let's go! Come on!

01:16:15.749 --> 01:16:16.948
Let's go!

01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:38.971
Here's the power plant.

01:16:46.715 --> 01:16:48.048
Alright.

01:16:48.116 --> 01:16:50.184
This is the main reservoir
beneath the power station.

01:16:50.251 --> 01:16:52.787
This is right where we want the
Lampreys.

01:16:53.054 --> 01:16:54.822
You guys go off there.

01:16:54.889 --> 01:16:56.190
Come with me.

01:16:58.126 --> 01:17:01.996
You guys go find the switch. We'll
use the livers to attract the Lampreys.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.207
It's so dark. How do we
know they're down there?

01:17:12.274 --> 01:17:12.808
One second. Listen.

01:17:14.644 --> 01:17:16.045
They're down there. Dump'em in.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.815
Back up, back up, back up!

01:17:18.882 --> 01:17:20.082
Are you guys ok?

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:21.984
Yeah, there's just some
Lampreys.

01:17:22.052 --> 01:17:23.653
Alex, get the weed
whacker!

01:17:23.721 --> 01:17:25.221
Throw them in.

01:17:37.168 --> 01:17:39.770
You guys finish this. I got that.
- Ok.

01:17:45.176 --> 01:17:46.710
Alright, stay back.

01:17:46.778 --> 01:17:48.713
- Alex!
- Back up! Back up!

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.319
It's not gonna be enough.

01:17:55.388 --> 01:17:56.821
We need more Lampreys.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.342
Look, I can go down the
ladder, kill some Lampreys,

01:18:02.343 --> 01:18:04.352
harvest some livers and
come out quick.  It'll work.

01:18:04.387 --> 01:18:05.964
No no. It's too risky.
We have to find another way.

01:18:06.032 --> 01:18:09.935
- We don't have enough time.
- It's too risky. Now come on!

01:18:10.136 --> 01:18:12.037
I'm gonna stay here. Stay and
watch.

01:18:13.774 --> 01:18:19.044
- Go! Be with you family!
- Alright alright! I'll be back! I'm coming!

01:18:20.948 --> 01:18:24.651
Nicole! Nicole!

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:42.970
Alright look, gut'em. We need
more livers.

01:18:43.038 --> 01:18:44.705
Where's Will?

01:18:46.942 --> 01:18:47.942
Dammit!

01:18:48.009 --> 01:18:49.977
Take the kids and find the main
switch!

01:18:56.385 --> 01:18:58.320
Will, I'm on my way!

01:19:03.326 --> 01:19:06.361
You don't have to do
this! Come on!

01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:07.696
Get out of here Michael!

01:19:07.764 --> 01:19:09.165
Go on to the power station!

01:19:09.232 --> 01:19:10.934
I'm not leaving without
you.

01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:15.638
I'm not young like them. I don't
have a family like you!

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.340
I don't have anything!

01:19:17.407 --> 01:19:18.641
Let me have this!

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:19.943
I'm not leaving without you.

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.744
Michael! Go!

01:19:21.812 --> 01:19:23.079
No!

01:19:23.146 --> 01:19:24.915
- Stubborn fool!
- Takes one to know one.

01:19:24.983 --> 01:19:30.287
What you said about not having
anyone, it's not true! You have me!

01:19:37.195 --> 01:19:38.829
Help me!

01:19:38.897 --> 01:19:40.163
Come on! Come on!

01:19:40.231 --> 01:19:42.233
- Go Michael! Go!
- No! No!

01:19:42.301 --> 01:19:44.302
I'll be right behind you!

01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:46.705
- I'll be right behind you!
- Alright.

01:19:48.908 --> 01:19:50.876
Just hold them off for a second.

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.387
Will!

01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:07.259
Give me your hand. Give me your
hand.

01:20:09.897 --> 01:20:10.863
Michael!

01:20:11.231 --> 01:20:12.498
I can't.

01:20:12.566 --> 01:20:15.836
I can't get good
footing. I'm slipping.

01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:17.938
Don't worry, I got you.

01:20:27.882 --> 01:20:29.316
Kyle! No! Go away!

01:20:29.384 --> 01:20:31.318
