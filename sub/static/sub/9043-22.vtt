WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:05.167
- WELL, I HOPE EVERYBODY
LIKES PIZZA POCKETS.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.200
- OH...

00:09.200 --> 00:13.133
MICROWAVED APPETIZERS.

00:13.133 --> 00:14.800
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT

00:14.800 --> 00:19.233
BEFORE I STARTED TOMORROW'S
EASTER DINNER FROM SCRATCH.

00:20.867 --> 00:22.400
- THAT REMINDS ME.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.800
WE DON'T WANT TO MISS
THE MORNING'S WORSHIP.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.967
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY GOOD
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES

00:25.967 --> 00:27.167
AROUND HERE?

00:27.167 --> 00:30.600
I LEFT MY DIRECTORY AT HOME.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.467
- WE WERE THINKING
THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER

00:32.467 --> 00:34.633
IF WE ALL WENT TO OUR CHURCH.

00:34.633 --> 00:39.067
- YOU MEAN YOUR...

00:39.067 --> 00:42.833
CATHOLIC CHURCH?

00:42.833 --> 00:44.833
- YEAH. PROBLEM?

00:44.833 --> 00:48.067
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.633
- OH, WHY NOT, HANK?

00:49.633 --> 00:54.200
IT'S INTERESTING TO OBSERVE
OTHER DENOMINATIONS.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.600
- YEAH, IT'LL BE LIKE
A SAFARI FOR YOU.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.267
WHO KNOWS?

01:02.267 --> 01:06.467
ON THE WAY, WE MIGHT EVEN SPOT
A HERD OF LUTHERANS.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.933
- OH, ROBERT,
YOUR DAD'S SO FUNNY.

01:14.933 --> 01:17.300
- YEAH, ALWAYS WITH THE JOKES.

01:17.300 --> 01:21.400
OKAY, WHO ELSE
WOULD LIKE TO TALK?

01:21.400 --> 01:22.767
- OH, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,

01:22.767 --> 01:25.367
PETER SAID HE'D BE
JOINING US TOMORROW.

01:25.367 --> 01:27.300
- OH, GOOD.
PETER'S COMING.

01:27.300 --> 01:31.033
I HAD MY FINGERS CROSSED.

01:36.967 --> 01:40.633
- CAN I WATCH TV NOW?

01:40.633 --> 01:41.867
- NO, FRANK.

01:41.867 --> 01:45.033
- THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO ALL NIGHT?

01:45.033 --> 01:48.200
- LESS CURSING, I HOPE.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.533
- WHO CURSED?

01:49.533 --> 01:53.633
- YOU REFERRED
TO THE ANTIPODE OF HEAVEN.

01:53.633 --> 01:58.833
- WHAT THE HELL KIND OF
MOON-MAN TALK IS THAT?

01:58.833 --> 02:02.733
- WELL, THERE IT IS AGAIN.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.367
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

02:10.367 --> 02:12.133
WHY DON'T WE DO A PUZZLE?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.967
- GOOD THINKING, MOTHER.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.133
- PUZZLE, SURE.

02:15.133 --> 02:17.533
- PUZZLE? OKAY.
PUZZLE.

02:17.533 --> 02:18.933
- I BROUGHT ONE
FROM HOME.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.567
- AH, THERE YOU GO.

02:20.567 --> 02:24.733
- I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE NICE
FOR EASTER.

02:24.733 --> 02:26.667
OH, MY.

02:26.667 --> 02:30.933
- "SACRED DEATH"?

02:30.933 --> 02:35.333
- IS THAT
A HEAVY-METAL BAND?

02:35.333 --> 02:37.033
- THIS MUST BE ONE OF PETER'S.

02:37.033 --> 02:38.233
IT WAS DARK IN THE CLOSET,

02:38.233 --> 02:43.000
AND I JUST SAW THE WORD
"SACRED."

02:43.000 --> 02:45.500
- A HEAVY-METAL PUZZLE.

02:47.533 --> 02:52.167
- LOOK, IT SAYS, "500 PIECES
OF HEAD-BANGING FUN."

02:57.367 --> 03:00.000
- SOUNDS DIFFICULT.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.933
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, HANK?

03:01.933 --> 03:03.200
- WELL, WE'RE ALREADY GOING

03:03.200 --> 03:07.167
TO CATHOLIC CHURCH TOMORROW.
WE'RE--

03:07.167 --> 03:11.267
I GUESS WE CAN JUST CALL IT
A LOST WEEKEND.

03:18.367 --> 03:21.633
- COME ON, ROBERT. IT'S LATE.
- YEAH, GO HOME.

03:21.633 --> 03:24.200
YOU DIDN'T GET A PIECE IN
ALL NIGHT ANYWAY.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.833
- I GOT IT. I GOT IT!

03:27.833 --> 03:30.333
- IT--IT DOESN'T FIT, OKAY?
DON'T FORCE IT.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.400
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.667
- IT DOESN'T FIT!

03:33.667 --> 03:37.167
- IT FITS!
I'M TELLING YOU IT FITS!

03:37.167 --> 03:40.200
- WHAT ARE YOU--

03:42.833 --> 03:44.967
- SEE? PERFECT.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.233
[spits]

03:48.700 --> 03:50.033
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:50.033 --> 03:52.433
AND YOU GOT SPIT
ALL OVER HERE NOW.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.200
- GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.
- GOOD NIGHT.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.467
- GOOD NIGHT.
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.933
- GOOD NIGHT, MOM AND DAD.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.800
- GOOD NIGHT, GOOD NIGHT.
- SWEET DREAMS, HONEY.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.333
- THAT'S IT FOR ME, MOTHER.

04:02.333 --> 04:06.133
I'VE GOT QUITE A BIT
OF FLOSSING TO DO.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.467
GOOD NIGHT.

04:08.467 --> 04:14.467
- I'LL BE THERE JUST AS SOON
AS I FINISH THIS FLAMING SKULL.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.433
- ARE YOU COMING UP, RAY?

04:16.433 --> 04:18.200
- YEAH, I JUST WANT
TO FINISH THIS SECTION.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.933
- OKAY. NIGHT, PAT.
NIGHT, RAY.

04:20.933 --> 04:22.767
- YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.900
- HERE, RAY, THIS LOOKS LIKE
IT'S PART OF THE SNAKE

04:27.900 --> 04:32.000
CRAWLING ON THAT POOR
YOUNG LADY'S BOTTOM.

04:34.967 --> 04:36.500
- YEAH, THAT FITS.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.067
YOU GOT A GOOD EYE
FOR THIS.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.067
- I THINK
WE'RE A GOOD TEAM.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.333
WE'RE LIKE KAREEM
AND MAGIC JOHNSON.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.767
- KAREEM AND MAGIC?

04:48.767 --> 04:50.167
YOU KNOW BASKETBALL?

04:50.167 --> 04:53.133
- ONLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED
FROM YOUR COLUMN.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.667
- REALLY?
YOU READ MY COLUMN?

04:54.667 --> 04:57.400
- OH, YES, EVER SINCE
WE BECAME FAMILY.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.367
THEY HAVE "NEWSDAY"
IN THE LIBRARY.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.067
- YOU GO TO THE LIBRARY
TO READ MY COLUMN?

05:04.067 --> 05:07.700
- IT'S ONLY A 20-MINUTE DRIVE.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.733
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.633
- THANKS.

05:16.467 --> 05:19.800
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
OF WRITING A BOOK.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.500
- YOU ARE?
- YEAH.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.200
YEAH, I TRIED
WRITING BOOKS BEFORE,

05:24.200 --> 05:25.467
BUT I-I NEVER FINISHED 'EM.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.800
SAME AS READING 'EM,
YOU KNOW?

05:27.800 --> 05:30.033
BUT, UM...

05:30.033 --> 05:31.633
THIS ONE I'M WORKING ON,

05:31.633 --> 05:34.367
IT'S ABOUT MICKEY MANTLE
AND HIS RELATIONSHIP

05:34.367 --> 05:35.967
WITH BILLY MARTIN
AND WHITEY FORD.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.767
DO YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS?

05:37.767 --> 05:39.167
- I'VE HEARD OF MICKEY.

05:39.167 --> 05:42.767
I DON'T KNOW BILLY OR WHITEY.

05:42.767 --> 05:45.733
- WELL, THEY WERE
THESE GREAT PLAYERS,

05:45.733 --> 05:48.033
AND THEY ALL HUNG OUT TOGETHER.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.300
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.633
IT'S PROBABLY STUPID.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.600
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S STUPID AT ALL.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.400
WHAT DOES DEBRA THINK?
SHE MUST BE VERY EXCITED.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.933
- OH, I HAVEN'T EVEN
TOLD DEBRA.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.200
- NO?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.800
- NAH, SHE DOESN'T EVEN
READ MY COLUMN.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.167
- OH, SHE MUST.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.133
- YEAH, NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.

06:04.133 --> 06:06.367
SHE USED TO
WHEN WE WERE DATING,

06:06.367 --> 06:09.333
AND SHE WAS ALL WOOING ME.

06:11.967 --> 06:15.767
- WELL, NOW SHE'S PROBABLY BUSY
TAKING CARE OF THE HOUSE

06:15.767 --> 06:17.733
AND THE CHILDREN AND YOU.

06:17.733 --> 06:20.333
- YEAH, I GUESS.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE?

06:25.900 --> 06:29.400
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T READ
YOUR COLUMN SO MUCH ANYMORE

06:29.400 --> 06:32.500
BECAUSE SHE'S FEELING
A LITTLE JEALOUS.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.600
- JEALOUS?

06:33.600 --> 06:35.067
- WELL, I WOULDN'T BLAME HER.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.733
YOU HAVE SUCH
AN EXCITING LIFE, RAY.

06:37.733 --> 06:40.067
YOU MEET A LOT
OF INTERESTING PEOPLE,

06:40.067 --> 06:43.267
AND YOU GO
TO SO MANY EXOTIC PLACES.

06:43.267 --> 06:47.000
- YOU MEAN LIKE...TAMPA?

06:49.700 --> 06:53.167
- YOU'VE BEEN TO TAMPA?

06:58.533 --> 07:01.667
- COUPLE TIMES.

07:01.667 --> 07:05.133
- WELL, THERE YOU GO.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.033
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I FEEL
A LITTLE JEALOUS

07:08.033 --> 07:09.700
OF HANK'S WORK.

07:11.367 --> 07:14.833
- HE'S A HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.267
- VICE PRINCIPAL.

07:17.267 --> 07:18.900
BUT YOU'D THINK
HE WAS THE PRINCIPAL

07:18.900 --> 07:22.300
THE WAY HE ALWAYS COMES HOME
WITH SUCH INTERESTING STORIES.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.200
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY,
"MY GOSH,

07:24.200 --> 07:26.400
"WHAT I WOULD GIVE TO BE
A FLY ON THE WALL

07:26.400 --> 07:29.633
OF THAT TEACHERS' LOUNGE."

07:32.333 --> 07:35.167
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.467
- THAT'S OKAY.
I LIKE HOW YOU TALK.

07:40.467 --> 07:44.933
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
YOU'RE A VERY PERCEPTIVE PERSON,

07:44.933 --> 07:47.000
AND YOU LIKE SPORTS.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.267
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK
TO MY MOM.

07:50.267 --> 07:52.267
- WELL, I'M SURE
SHE LOVES YOUR WRITING.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.800
- OH, SHE'S ANOTHER ONE.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.967
SHE STILL HASN'T GOT
OVER THE FACT

07:56.967 --> 07:59.033
THAT I DIDN'T BECOME A POET

07:59.033 --> 08:01.600
OR A OPERA WRITER

08:01.600 --> 08:04.000
OR HER BIOGRAPHER.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.233
- WELL, YOUR MOTHER
IS A STRONG PERSONALITY.

08:08.233 --> 08:11.600
BUT SHE HAS A GOOD HEART.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.033
I THINK, IN MANY WAYS,
SHE'S STILL JUST A LITTLE GIRL

08:15.033 --> 08:18.300
WHO'S LOOKING
FOR ACCEPTANCE AND LOVE.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.133
- HMM. I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER
LIKE THAT.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.933
I'VE ALWAYS JUST THOUGHT
OF HER AS...

08:25.933 --> 08:29.433
MOM.

08:29.433 --> 08:32.667
- WELL, I'M A MOM
TO AMY AND PETER.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.967
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.167
YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THIS.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.967
YOU'RE TOO NICE.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.133
- AW, THANKS, RAY.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.800
I THINK YOU'RE NICE TOO.

08:41.800 --> 08:44.900
- ALL RIGHT.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.400
ANYWAY,
THIS SECTION'S ALL DONE.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.133
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.200
WELL, WHY NOT?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.500
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

08:57.667 --> 09:01.500
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY DAD?

09:07.300 --> 09:11.167
- I THINK WE SHOULD
FINISH THE PUZZLE.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.733
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:52.733 --> 09:54.233
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:54.233 --> 09:57.667
- I'M SORRY.
YOU--YOU WERE ON MY SIDE.

09:59.367 --> 10:02.833
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GO THAT FAR.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.900
- IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
WHERE WERE YOU?

10:05.900 --> 10:08.800
- I WAS DOING THE PUZZLE
WITH THE LADY--YOU KNOW, PAT.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.300
- TILL NOW?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.267
- AH, IT WAS A GOOD PUZZLE,
AND WE GOT TO TALKING,

10:12.267 --> 10:15.200
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW LATE IT WAS.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.733
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
THAT PAT.

10:17.733 --> 10:21.100
- OH, I'M GLAD YOU TWO
ARE WARMING UP TO EACH OTHER.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.567
MAYBE THE NEXT TIME
MY MOTHER COMES,

10:22.567 --> 10:27.633
I'LL TELL HER
TO BRING A PUZZLE.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.467
- YEAH.

10:29.467 --> 10:31.833
YOUR MOTHER'S
NOT REALLY COMING, IS SHE?

10:31.833 --> 10:34.167
- NO, RAY. RELAX.

10:35.967 --> 10:39.133
SO WHAT DID YOU AND PAT
TALK ABOUT FOR THREE HOURS?

10:39.133 --> 10:40.633
- NOTHING.

10:40.633 --> 10:41.900
YOU KNOW, JUST...

10:41.900 --> 10:44.900
FAMILY, PARENTS,
KIDS, WORK,

10:44.900 --> 10:47.100
THIS BOOK IDEA.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.367
TURNS OUT
SHE'S A BIG FAN OF MINE.

10:49.367 --> 10:54.133
GOES TO THE LIBRARY
TO READ MY COLUMN.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.700
- WHAT BOOK IDEA?

10:55.700 --> 10:56.900
- OH, YEAH.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.433
JUST--I'M THINKING
ABOUT WRITING A BOOK.

10:59.433 --> 11:02.333
- YOU ARE?
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.467
- YEAH, WELL,
I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

11:05.467 --> 11:06.933
- BOTHER ME?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.600
I'M YOUR WIFE.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.400
I MEAN, I THINK IF YOU HAVE
BIG NEWS

11:10.400 --> 11:13.033
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA WRITE A BOOK,
YOU'D TELL ME FIRST.

11:13.033 --> 11:14.600
YOU DON'T GO TELLING
SOME OTHER WOMAN

11:14.600 --> 11:19.133
JUST BECAUSE SHE GOES
TO THE LIBRARY FOR YOU.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.500
- FIRST OF ALL,
SHE'S NOT SOME OTHER WOMAN.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.467
SHE'S MRS. MACDOUGALL,
ALL RIGHT?

11:24.467 --> 11:27.533
AND SHE DOESN'T JUST GO
TO THE LIBRARY.

11:27.533 --> 11:30.800
SHE WALKS THERE, SOMETIMES
THROUGH A FOOT OF SNOW.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.033
- ALL RIGHT.

11:38.033 --> 11:41.100
SO TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR BOOK IDEA.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.033
- NOW?
IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

11:43.033 --> 11:45.633
- OH, BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO TALK TO YOUR NEW BEST PAL,

11:45.633 --> 11:47.167
PAT MACDOUGALL.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.500
- COME ON, DEBRA.
WHAT?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.133
- FINE, FINE.

11:50.133 --> 11:53.233
I'M HAPPY
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

11:53.233 --> 11:56.333
- HMM. JEALOUS.

12:03.833 --> 12:08.133
- WELL, HANK, WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF OUR EXOTIC CATHOLIC RITUALS?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.333
- QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.800
AND I THOUGHT
YOUR FATHER HUBLEY

12:10.800 --> 12:13.800
GAVE A VERY STIRRING READING
OF THE RESURRECTION.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.567
OF COURSE,
THAT'S A TOUGH STORY TO BOTCH.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.533
- IT IS A WONDERFUL DAY.

12:20.533 --> 12:24.500
THE LORD HAS RISEN,
AND NOW MY BRUNCH.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.800
- PETER WAS VERY INSPIRED
BY THAT CATHOLIC CEREMONY.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.200
- COME ON, PETER.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.533
WHEN ARE WE GONNA
HAVE THE EASTER-EGG HUNT?

12:34.533 --> 12:36.500
- OH, PATIENCE,
LITTLE ONES, PATIENCE.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.867
NOW RUN ALONG
AND PLAY IN THE GARDEN.

12:38.867 --> 12:40.733
- HEY...

12:40.733 --> 12:42.500
WE STILL GOT TO FINISH
THAT PUZZLE, RIGHT?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.200
- OH, YEAH. I'D LIKE THAT.
- YEAH.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.200
- HEY, MAMA, I'LL HELP YOU HIDE
THE EASTER EGGS IN THE GARDEN,

12:46.200 --> 12:47.400
IF YOU LIKE.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.600
I'M AN "EGGSPERT."

12:48.600 --> 12:49.800
- OH, PETER!

12:49.800 --> 12:51.867
- HEY, I'LL--
I'LL GO WITH YOU, PAT.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.200
- UH, RAY.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.800
WHY DON'T YOU
HELP US SET THE TABLE?

12:54.800 --> 12:58.400
- OH, UH, CAN'T YOU GUYS DO IT?
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.300
- YEAH, HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.800
- WE WERE JUST DOING A PUZZLE.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.767
- MM-HMM. AND TALKING
TILL 2:00 IN THE MORNING...

13:05.767 --> 13:08.800
AND NOT JUST SMALL TALK--
VERY MEANINGFUL, HMM?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.200
HIM AND PAT.

13:12.633 --> 13:16.533
- YOU HAD A MEANINGFUL
CONVERSATION WITH HER?

13:16.533 --> 13:17.567
- YEAH.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.900
- JUST NOT ENOUGH MOTHERS
IN THE WORLD FOR YOU,

13:24.900 --> 13:27.767
ARE THERE, RAYMOND?

13:38.533 --> 13:39.667
HEY, PETER.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.933
- HEY.
YOU WANT A CHOCOLATE EGG?

13:41.933 --> 13:43.067
I'VE BEEN SITTING ON THEM.

13:43.067 --> 13:46.100
THEY'RE ABOUT READY TO HATCH.

13:50.967 --> 13:54.233
- SO DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT YOUR MOM AND MY BROTHER?

13:54.233 --> 13:56.933
THEY HAD A REAL
HEART-TO-HEART TALK LAST NIGHT.

13:56.933 --> 13:59.267
- OH, YEAH?
- OH, YEAH.

13:59.267 --> 14:02.067
APPARENTLY
INTO THE WEE HOURS.

14:02.067 --> 14:06.800
THEY BONDED OVER
YOUR SACRED DEATH PUZZLE.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.367
- WHAT?
[groans]

14:10.467 --> 14:11.467
MAMA!

14:11.467 --> 14:13.700
- OH, PETER,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:13.700 --> 14:17.200
- NO! WHAT WERE YOU DOING
TOUCHING MY SACRED DEATH PUZZLE?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.667
- I'M SORRY, PETER.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.300
- IT IS NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE TAKEN OUT OF ITS BOX!

14:21.300 --> 14:22.733
IT'S A COLLECTOR'S ITEM!

14:22.733 --> 14:25.667
CORRECTION.
IT WAS A COLLECTOR'S ITEM!

14:25.667 --> 14:27.267
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO EXPLAIN THIS

14:27.267 --> 14:29.433
AT THE CONVENTION?

14:29.433 --> 14:35.367
"I'M SORRY.
IT'S ONLY BEEN USED BY MY MOM!"

14:35.367 --> 14:38.367
- RAYMOND BIT OFF A PIECE
JUST TO MAKE IT FIT.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.933
- AH!

14:40.933 --> 14:43.600
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU TOUCH MY THINGS!

14:43.600 --> 14:47.667
THIS IS WHY YOU ARE NOT
SUPPOSED TO TOUCH MY THINGS!

14:47.667 --> 14:49.000
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.433
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
TO BRING THE FAMILY TOGETHER.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.567
- WELL, IT CERTAINLY BROUGHT HER
AND RAYMOND TOGETHER.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.833
- WHAT WERE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

14:57.833 --> 14:58.867
- OH, MANY THINGS.

14:58.867 --> 15:00.367
WE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.867
WE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA
FOR A BOOK

15:02.867 --> 15:04.233
RAYMOND'S GOING TO WRITE.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.033
- HO HO HO!
WHOA.

15:06.033 --> 15:08.500
YOU TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT A BOOK IDEA?

15:08.500 --> 15:13.100
YOU NEVER TALK TO ME
ABOUT MY COMIC BOOK IDEAS!

15:13.100 --> 15:14.533
- PETER, I WOULD LIKE TO.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.233
IT'S JUST THAT
I HAVE A PROBLEM

15:16.233 --> 15:20.667
RELATING TO CHARACTERS
WHO EAT HUMAN FLESH.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.733
- MAMA, THIS IS MY ART!

15:22.733 --> 15:25.100
AND IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM

15:25.100 --> 15:28.667
TALKING TO RAY ABOUT HIS ART!

15:31.633 --> 15:36.533
- MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE
HIS ZOMBIES ANOTHER CHANCE.

15:37.967 --> 15:41.433
- SO, UM, MOTHER MACDOUGALL...

15:41.433 --> 15:45.700
PERHAPS THIS MIGHT BE
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

15:45.700 --> 15:48.833
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE BIT BETTER, HUH?

15:48.833 --> 15:51.200
- OH, I WOULD LIKE THAT,
ROBERT.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.367
- SO, UM...

15:58.033 --> 16:00.800
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?

16:00.800 --> 16:01.900
- BLUE.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.433
- AH.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.267
I GOT TO GO.

16:26.067 --> 16:29.133
- AMY, GUESS WHAT MOM
DID WITH RAY.

16:29.133 --> 16:30.867
- OH. I KNOW, PETER.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.533
- WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:32.533 --> 16:34.367
- RAYMOND WAS UP UNTIL 2:00
IN THE MORNING

16:34.367 --> 16:37.567
HAVING A LONG AND INTIMATE
CONVERSATION WITH AMY'S MOTHER.

16:45.533 --> 16:48.033
- RAYMOND...

16:48.033 --> 16:50.200
IS THIS TRUE?

16:50.200 --> 16:55.500
- AND, APPARENTLY,
IT WAS PRETTY JUICY.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.467
- NO, WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT FAMILY AND STUFF.

16:58.467 --> 17:03.167
- SAY, MA, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN REPLACED.

17:06.167 --> 17:09.600
- WELL, RAYMOND...

17:09.600 --> 17:13.467
IT APPEARS THAT YOU WILL DO
EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER

17:13.467 --> 17:16.633
TO AVOID TALKING TO ME,
YOUR OWN MOTHER,

17:16.633 --> 17:20.367
AND YET YOU SEEM
TO BARE YOUR SOUL

17:20.367 --> 17:22.233
TO A TOTAL STRANGER.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.767
- MA, LOOK,
THERE WAS NO BARING, OKAY?

17:25.767 --> 17:27.333
AND--AND I ALWAYS TALK TO YOU.

17:27.333 --> 17:30.833
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.333
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

17:32.333 --> 17:36.333
WHY DON'T WE GO FOR A NICE
LONG WALK RIGHT NOW?

17:36.333 --> 17:38.933
- I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.
- OH, YOU CAN'T RIGHT NOW?

17:38.933 --> 17:41.000
I'M SURE YOU'D BE HAPPY
TO GO FOR A WALK WITH PAT,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.200
WOULDN'T YOU?

17:42.200 --> 17:43.400
- I'LL WALK WITH YOU, MA.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.233
- ROBBIE, PLEASE, I'M BUSY.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.600
- PARDON MY CURIOSITY,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.967
BUT WHAT EXACTLY
WERE YOU AND MRS. MACDOUGALL

17:55.967 --> 17:57.467
TALKING ABOUT ALL EVENING?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.633
- NOTHING TO GET UPSET ABOUT.

17:59.633 --> 18:00.933
- I DO NOT GET UPSET.

18:00.933 --> 18:04.767
THERE ARE JUST CERTAIN SUBJECTS
I FEEL SHOULD REMAIN

18:04.767 --> 18:06.633
BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND A WIFE.

18:06.633 --> 18:09.067
- YES, I AGREE, HANK.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.533
- AND, SO I AM SOMEWHAT
EAGER TO KNOW...

18:11.533 --> 18:15.367
WHAT DID THE WOMAN SAY
ABOUT ME?

18:15.367 --> 18:17.467
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE JUST--

18:17.467 --> 18:19.267
SHE TALKED ABOUT
ALL THE INTERESTING THINGS

18:19.267 --> 18:21.033
THAT HAPPEN
IN YOUR TEACHERS' LOUNGE.

18:21.033 --> 18:25.000
- GOOD LORD!
IT WAS A CHRISTMAS PARTY!

18:26.200 --> 18:27.600
I DO NOT DRINK!

18:27.600 --> 18:29.567
I HAD NO IDEA
THOSE LITTLE RUM BALLS

18:29.567 --> 18:34.333
WOULD TRIGGER A SLIGHTLY
SALTY PIRATE IMPERSONATION.

18:39.567 --> 18:42.267
- HOT DAMN, HANK,
I'M STARTING TO LIKE YOU.

18:43.900 --> 18:48.367
HEY, SOMEONE GET CAPTAIN HOOK
A BOILERMAKER.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.500
- COME ON, EVERYONE,

18:51.500 --> 18:53.900
YOU'RE MISSING THE CHILDREN
HUNTING FOR EASTER EGGS.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.767
- YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY SON!

18:56.767 --> 18:58.467
- EXCUSE ME?

18:58.467 --> 19:00.633
- CAN I ASK YOU--
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

19:00.633 --> 19:03.133
YOU TALK TO RAYMOND.
I'M YOUR SON-IN-LAW!

19:03.133 --> 19:06.033
I HAVE A TITLE--
SON-IN-LAW.

19:06.033 --> 19:09.567
HE DOESN'T HAVE A TITLE.
NO TITLE!

19:13.800 --> 19:15.967
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:15.967 --> 19:19.000
- YOU VIOLATED THE SANCTITY
OF THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE!

19:19.000 --> 19:20.600
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.800
- IF YOU DON'T READ
MY "ZOMBIE BLOOD CHRONICLES,"

19:22.800 --> 19:25.467
YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER!

19:25.467 --> 19:26.667
- LOOK, LEAVE HER ALONE!
ALL OF YOU!

19:26.667 --> 19:28.200
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.700
WE--WE DID A PUZZLE,
AND WE HAD A NICE TALK,

19:30.700 --> 19:34.033
AND SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG, AND NEITHER DID I!

19:34.033 --> 19:37.500
THAT'S RIGHT!
I AM NOT ASHAMED!

19:42.467 --> 19:44.667
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GREAT
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

19:44.667 --> 19:47.833
THIS LADY DIDN'T JUDGE ME
OR CRITICIZE ME,

19:47.833 --> 19:51.433
WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M NOT
EXACTLY USED TO AROUND HERE.

19:51.433 --> 19:54.933
SHE LISTENED,
AND SHE WAS NICE.

19:54.933 --> 19:57.200
AND LIKE JESUS SAID,

19:57.200 --> 20:00.167
"BLESSED ARE THE NICE."

20:04.333 --> 20:09.033
- [scoffs]
HE NEVER SAID THAT.

20:09.033 --> 20:12.267
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING!

20:14.000 --> 20:17.233
BLESSED ARE YOU.

20:17.233 --> 20:19.700
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYBODY SAYS.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.600
WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL,

20:21.600 --> 20:23.467
AND I LOOK FORWARD
TO MANY YEARS

20:23.467 --> 20:27.233
OF NICE, LONG CONVERSATIONS.

20:27.233 --> 20:31.533
- I THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD COOL IT.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.567
- WHAT?

20:37.567 --> 20:40.033
- WELL, EVERYBODY
SEEMS TO BE SO UPSET

20:40.033 --> 20:42.100
JUST BECAUSE
WE HAD A LITTLE TALK.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.400
[all mumbling]

20:43.400 --> 20:45.100
- NO, NO, NO, NO! PAT!

20:45.100 --> 20:48.500
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THEN THEY WIN!

20:50.267 --> 20:51.567
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.633
THEY'RE TRYING
TO TEAR US APART.

20:53.633 --> 20:57.033
- BUT, RAY,
IT WAS JUST A TALK.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
JUST A TALK?

20:58.733 --> 21:00.000
THIS WAS SPECIAL.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.367
YOU DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
WITH EVERYBODY.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.233
- SHE KIND OF DOES.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.333
- OH.

21:15.333 --> 21:19.767
- HA, HA!
SHE'S NICE TO EVERYONE.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.200
- COME ON, EVERYBODY.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.267
THE CHILDREN ARE WAITING
IN THE BACKYARD.

21:23.267 --> 21:27.067
- AH, THE CHILDREN--
ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THEM.

21:30.933 --> 21:32.200
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, RAY.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.200
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SACRED DEATH.

21:37.967 --> 21:40.033
- HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU NEEDED PEOPLE TO TALK TO.

21:40.033 --> 21:44.333
ANYTIME YOU NEED SUPPORT,
I'M HERE FOR YOU, DUMBASS.
