WEBVTT

00:04.794 --> 00:06.054
Hey, Julia?

00:06.504 --> 00:08.013
I was wondering...

00:08.507 --> 00:09.942
When you get breasts,

00:09.966 --> 00:12.018
does it happen right away?

00:12.427 --> 00:14.780
I mean, can you
see them growing?

00:14.804 --> 00:16.866
Not unless you use Miracle Gro.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.233
Just asking.

00:26.024 --> 00:27.710
- Justin.
- Hey, Jule.

00:27.734 --> 00:31.079
Uh, you weren't at the yearbook
meeting, so I brought by a schedule.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.466
I don't know about the
yearbook this year.

00:33.490 --> 00:34.550
Yeah.

00:34.574 --> 00:36.427
Well, I figured you probably
missed it on purpose,

00:36.451 --> 00:38.378
but, you know, just in case.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.005
Yeah, well, thanks, I guess.

00:41.665 --> 00:43.007
Julia!

00:43.375 --> 00:46.177
How come girls stop having their
period when they get old?

00:47.087 --> 00:49.148
I don't know. I guess
so they won't have kids

00:49.172 --> 00:51.057
when they're too old
to take care of them.

00:51.549 --> 00:54.310
I took her to that health
class film yesterday.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.313
If nipples are for
breast-feeding,

00:57.973 --> 00:59.867
how come boys have them, too?

00:59.891 --> 01:02.026
God, Claudia, they
just do, okay?

01:02.936 --> 01:04.988
Oh. Hi, Justin.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.657
How come you never
come over anymore?

01:08.483 --> 01:11.170
Well, I guess Julia's too
busy to hang out with me now.

01:11.194 --> 01:12.505
Yeah. Really busy.

01:12.529 --> 01:14.549
Talking on the phone.
Reading magazines.

01:14.573 --> 01:16.624
Claudia, go fill the
ice trays, okay?

01:18.243 --> 01:20.795
Well, if you ever run out of
magazines, you should call me.

01:20.870 --> 01:22.547
We could go out.

01:23.081 --> 01:24.632
Yeah. Sure.

01:27.002 --> 01:29.981
Oh, we're seeing a movie tomorrow,
me and Libby and some people.

01:30.005 --> 01:32.140
I don't know, Justin.
I'm kind of...

01:32.173 --> 01:33.391
You're busy.

01:33.425 --> 01:34.809
Yeah, sorry.

01:36.219 --> 01:37.437
See you.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.896 --> 01:48.072
What?

01:56.364 --> 01:57.582
Hey, man.

01:58.033 --> 02:00.136
Hey. How's practice?

02:00.160 --> 02:01.262
Lame, as always.

02:01.286 --> 02:05.099
Markum dropped a few key passes. Yeager
told stupid jokes in the shower.

02:05.123 --> 02:06.299
You know.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.551
This suspension is
so totally unfair.

02:09.836 --> 02:11.856
Trust me, Bay. You're
not missing much.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.232
That's easy for you to say.

02:13.256 --> 02:15.568
You're not the one who
suddenly has nothing to do.

02:15.592 --> 02:19.896
No team stuff, no way to
meet girls, no hanging out.

02:20.764 --> 02:24.817
You really miss stuff like
that when it just disappears.

02:26.561 --> 02:28.613
You think there's any way
Coach would bring me back?

02:29.189 --> 02:30.166
I don't know.

02:30.190 --> 02:31.658
I mean, not for me.

02:31.733 --> 02:34.035
You know, for the team.

02:34.069 --> 02:35.954
You guys are playing
Atherton tomorrow.

02:35.987 --> 02:37.298
Yeah, we're gonna get stomped.

02:37.322 --> 02:38.215
Right.

02:38.239 --> 02:41.719
So what if Monday morning, Coach just
happens to, like, run into me in the hall?

02:41.743 --> 02:43.095
He'll start thinking.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.254
What, that we wouldn't have
lost if you'd been playing?

02:45.330 --> 02:47.767
I know I'm not the strongest
guy on the squad, but...

02:47.791 --> 02:49.393
No, but you are the fastest.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.062
We're completely
screwed without you.

02:51.086 --> 02:54.065
Yeah, so I figure, you guys
pile on a few more losses,

02:54.089 --> 02:55.723
and I stay in Coach's face,

02:55.840 --> 02:57.433
he'll ask me back on.

02:58.468 --> 02:59.769
He might.

03:02.389 --> 03:03.815
He has to.

03:09.938 --> 03:11.322
Peas, Charlie?

03:11.606 --> 03:13.658
Yeah, you know, little
round, green...

03:13.817 --> 03:15.544
I said apricots.

03:15.568 --> 03:16.911
So I improvised.

03:16.986 --> 03:18.089
Come on, you can't
stay mad at me

03:18.113 --> 03:19.507
when I'm being such
a good helper.

03:19.531 --> 03:21.207
Owen hates peas.

03:22.992 --> 03:23.928
Here you go, slugger.

03:23.952 --> 03:25.012
Charlie!

03:25.036 --> 03:28.256
What did you do to the nice lady
to put her in such a bad mood?

03:28.331 --> 03:31.644
It wasn't him. It
was someone else.

03:31.668 --> 03:35.972
Someone irritating and meddlesome
and incredibly unreliable.

03:37.257 --> 03:38.641
She means me.

03:39.926 --> 03:42.279
Look, I apologize. What
more do you want from me?

03:42.303 --> 03:44.657
Excuse me, I have to tell you.

03:44.681 --> 03:48.703
You two remind me so much of me and
my husband when we were new parents.

03:48.727 --> 03:49.620
Oh, no...

03:49.644 --> 03:52.665
You'd kill him if he weren't
so damn lovable, wouldn't you?

03:52.689 --> 03:54.500
Don't go giving her
any ideas now.

03:54.524 --> 03:56.617
Oh, such a beautiful family.

03:56.943 --> 03:59.287
You're a very lucky
young couple.

04:02.073 --> 04:05.001
I believe the word was...
Lovable?

04:20.175 --> 04:21.892
Rough night in the field, huh?

04:22.218 --> 04:23.362
Well...

04:23.386 --> 04:26.522
So tell me, exactly how
humiliating was the loss?

04:26.598 --> 04:28.232
Details. I want details.

04:30.685 --> 04:31.986
Actually, Bay...

04:34.898 --> 04:37.283
Actually, Bay, we,
we kind of won.

04:39.027 --> 04:40.203
You what?

04:40.653 --> 04:43.299
I don't know. I guess we
just got lucky or something.

04:43.323 --> 04:44.592
Lucky? Against Atherton?

04:44.616 --> 04:46.886
They were division
champs last year.

04:46.910 --> 04:49.263
Yeah, well, they played
well and all, but...

04:49.287 --> 04:50.963
You just played better.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.591
I'm sorry, Bay. It
just kind of happened.

04:56.211 --> 04:58.971
Knock knock. Is Julia upstairs?

04:59.130 --> 05:00.107
Yeah.

05:00.131 --> 05:01.901
So what's the deal with
this Roger Cooley kid?

05:01.925 --> 05:04.977
Everyone at the coffee house said
he did, like, this amazing thing.

05:05.178 --> 05:06.354
It was...

05:06.805 --> 05:09.366
Yeah, it was kind of cool.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.576
Who's Roger Cooley?

05:10.600 --> 05:11.859
The new cornerback.

05:12.018 --> 05:13.662
He came up from JV last week.

05:13.686 --> 05:16.489
He, like, ran all the way
across the field or something?

05:17.857 --> 05:19.367
Down it. Yeah.

05:20.109 --> 05:21.494
I was cornerback.

05:21.653 --> 05:24.965
Then he scored a goal or
something, I don't know.

05:24.989 --> 05:26.332
A touchdown.

05:26.366 --> 05:28.010
Yeah. Right. Whatever.

05:28.034 --> 05:30.837
Anyway, they're, like, calling
him "Rocket Roger." It's weird.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.342
My replacement won the game?

05:36.709 --> 05:38.395
Yeah, but you know how it is.

05:38.419 --> 05:40.981
A lot of guys have one good play
in them, and then they never...

05:41.005 --> 05:43.641
Just... Forget it, Will.

05:46.928 --> 05:49.397
Coach is never gonna ask me
back on the team, is he?

05:49.931 --> 05:51.408
Hi, guys. Bye, guys.

05:51.432 --> 05:53.860
Brother's in slumberland,
and I'm out of here.

05:54.102 --> 05:57.081
Some guy called for you while
you were giving Owen a bath.

05:57.105 --> 05:58.739
Stu someone?

05:58.856 --> 06:01.085
Again? Really? Ooh.

06:01.109 --> 06:02.702
I'll have to do
something about that.

06:03.111 --> 06:04.797
I think he's got a
little thing for me.

06:04.821 --> 06:06.205
And you're not interested?

06:06.447 --> 06:09.176
Well, he's nice enough. He's in
this undergrad course I'm TA-ing,

06:09.200 --> 06:10.960
but he's 19.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.796
And that's... That's too young?

06:13.955 --> 06:17.008
I take care of babies, Bailey.
I don't date them.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.801
See you in the morning.

06:30.013 --> 06:33.117
Bottle of house white and
two glasses to table 14.

06:33.141 --> 06:34.358
Got it.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.014
Well, what brings you here?

06:55.038 --> 06:56.974
I just turned in a big paper.

06:56.998 --> 06:59.550
A friend wanted to take
me out and celebrate.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.220
Salinger's a long
way from Berkeley.

07:04.213 --> 07:06.525
Yeah, well, my friend's
a big oyster fiend,

07:06.549 --> 07:09.727
and you always say how
great they are here, so...

07:09.969 --> 07:11.113
Do you mind?

07:11.137 --> 07:12.688
No, no. Not at all.

07:12.931 --> 07:15.024
It'll be a lot of
fun, for all of us.

07:15.224 --> 07:17.485
Excuse me. That's my chair.

07:18.102 --> 07:20.831
Charlie, this is Lisa.
She's in my Freud class.

07:20.855 --> 07:22.666
Lisa, Charlie Salinger.

07:22.690 --> 07:25.701
My, um, boss, I guess.

07:25.735 --> 07:28.204
Oh, the one who sleeps late and
doesn't separate the wash?

07:30.073 --> 07:31.967
I hear you're in the
mood for oysters.

07:31.991 --> 07:33.260
In a big way.

07:33.284 --> 07:34.543
You got it.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.391
He's gorgeous.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.676
I know, but I don't know.

07:42.335 --> 07:45.388
So he was a little flaky. They're
all like that in the beginning.

07:45.713 --> 07:48.266
Honest to God, I
think you're crazy.

07:49.717 --> 07:50.977
Maybe.

07:51.386 --> 07:52.853
<i>This is cool.</i>

07:53.096 --> 07:54.114
Can I borrow it?

07:54.138 --> 07:55.273
Sure.

07:55.348 --> 07:56.941
I stole it from Charlie.

07:57.016 --> 07:59.527
I'm going to the beach later
tonight with Drew Stark.

08:00.979 --> 08:02.581
The guy from my science class?

08:02.605 --> 08:04.448
Since when have you
been seeing him?

08:04.524 --> 08:05.908
Since a couple days ago.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.660
What happened to Greg?

08:07.777 --> 08:09.245
Oh, please.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.746
He's so immature.

08:11.531 --> 08:16.252
Drew is the coolest, Julia.
He's cute, and he's funny.

08:16.661 --> 08:18.129
And he's a senior.

08:18.371 --> 08:20.214
Is he? It's a junior class.

08:21.416 --> 08:22.717
Well, I know.

08:23.501 --> 08:28.139
He's not Mr. Honor Roll,
but he's really...

08:28.548 --> 08:29.849
Sexy.

08:31.050 --> 08:32.309
Are you two...

08:33.845 --> 08:36.407
Not yet, but things could
happen at the beach.

08:36.431 --> 08:38.450
...You just started
going out with him.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.370
I know, but things just...

08:41.394 --> 08:44.238
I don't know... Things just
happened kind of fast, you know?

08:45.314 --> 08:48.200
When I'm with him, he
makes me feel like

08:48.568 --> 08:50.077
I've never felt before.

08:52.155 --> 08:53.372
Like how?

08:53.823 --> 08:55.082
Well, like...

08:55.825 --> 08:57.678
You know how, when
you're with a guy,

08:57.702 --> 09:01.505
and it just feels like
you belong together?

09:02.665 --> 09:03.841
Yeah.

09:04.584 --> 09:07.053
And then you're
fooling around and...

09:07.170 --> 09:10.806
You just kind of want
him to go further?

09:11.382 --> 09:12.359
Mmm-hmm.

09:12.383 --> 09:15.478
Well, it's like that,
only much, more more.

09:23.936 --> 09:26.498
Hey, how was the celebrating?

09:26.522 --> 09:30.493
It was great, but
I'm a little drunk.

09:31.652 --> 09:32.828
Where's Freud?

09:33.196 --> 09:35.581
She went home to fight
with her boyfriend.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.500
Sounds like fun.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.585
They have a very...

09:43.081 --> 09:44.965
...passionate relationship.

09:46.876 --> 09:48.344
Passion's good.

09:49.378 --> 09:50.554
Well...

09:51.172 --> 09:55.351
Good passion's good
but, bad passion is...

09:57.011 --> 09:58.187
Bad?

10:00.223 --> 10:02.149
And that's the whole problem.

10:04.102 --> 10:05.361
What is?

10:05.603 --> 10:08.489
Good passion and bad passion.

10:08.648 --> 10:09.949
They're like...

10:13.569 --> 10:15.079
...like, um...

10:16.614 --> 10:17.957
...this.

10:25.873 --> 10:27.133
Listen...

10:28.960 --> 10:34.432
I know this is a really
big favor to ask,

10:35.007 --> 10:36.225
but...

10:36.968 --> 10:38.227
But what?

10:39.929 --> 10:44.442
I was wondering, if you
could take me home.

10:46.519 --> 10:47.778
To my home.

10:52.817 --> 10:53.993
Sure.

11:07.039 --> 11:09.467
Privacy, Claudia. It's a word.
Look it up.

11:14.213 --> 11:15.431
Julia...

11:16.507 --> 11:18.017
I have a question.

11:19.302 --> 11:20.769
It's about intercourse.

11:21.137 --> 11:23.689
I mean, what does it feel like?

11:24.140 --> 11:25.117
Does it hurt?

11:25.141 --> 11:26.076
What?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.327
Because it seems like it would.

11:27.351 --> 11:29.705
I don't know, Claudia. Will
you just get out of here?

11:29.729 --> 11:31.456
Come on. I just want to know.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.115
Just beat it, okay?

12:16.192 --> 12:18.577
This is my beautiful home.

12:20.905 --> 12:21.965
It's dark.

12:21.989 --> 12:23.123
It's cheap.

12:24.533 --> 12:25.552
It's nice.

12:25.576 --> 12:26.961
It's spinning.

12:30.373 --> 12:32.549
You're gonna have a
killer headache tomorrow.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.102
Where's your Aspirin?

12:34.126 --> 12:35.719
In the bathroom.

12:40.883 --> 12:42.434
Why don't I give you
a hand with that?

12:47.974 --> 12:49.316
Ta-da.

12:53.396 --> 12:55.030
What a nice guy.

13:16.127 --> 13:17.303
Uh...

13:19.171 --> 13:21.265
Let me, let me get
you an Aspirin.

13:21.382 --> 13:22.975
Where was the bathroom again?

13:24.176 --> 13:25.195
In the west wing.

13:25.219 --> 13:26.395
Right.

13:36.564 --> 13:37.740
Yes.

14:04.258 --> 14:06.486
You know, Kirsten, I wouldn't have
figured you for the black lace type.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.686
I'd have said...

14:13.642 --> 14:14.818
Kirsten?

14:20.524 --> 14:21.700
Kirsten?

14:29.283 --> 14:30.542
Kirsten!

14:44.090 --> 14:45.265
Huh.

14:46.884 --> 14:48.528
<i>Attention, students.</i>

14:48.552 --> 14:50.781
<i>Due to the large
turnout expected,</i>

14:50.805 --> 14:53.533
<i>this afternoon's pep rally
for the football team</i>

14:53.557 --> 14:57.444
<i>will be moved from the clubhouse
to the large gymnasium.</i>

15:08.197 --> 15:10.342
Hey, you missed a
really great movie.

15:10.366 --> 15:11.385
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:11.409 --> 15:14.002
Well, I mean, you didn't miss
it, it's still playing, but...

15:17.039 --> 15:19.476
Maybe you can get your
new friends to take you.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.843
Maybe.

15:21.335 --> 15:22.312
Listen, Justin, I...

15:22.336 --> 15:24.930
I know. I got to go.
I'm a real busy guy.

15:26.549 --> 15:28.434
Julia...

15:30.886 --> 15:32.646
Oh, my God.

15:33.055 --> 15:34.523
What was it like?

15:35.015 --> 15:36.567
It was great.

15:37.351 --> 15:41.581
I mean, it's supposed to not be
perfect right away, I think,

15:41.605 --> 15:43.490
but I think it will get better.

15:44.108 --> 15:46.994
So, do you feel different?

15:47.445 --> 15:49.288
Kind of, yeah.

15:49.321 --> 15:52.458
I mean, I can't stop
thinking about it.

15:53.701 --> 15:56.962
He's just so cool.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.559
Oh, my God. I have class
with him, like, right now.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.092
How am I going to look at him?

16:02.376 --> 16:04.312
Just the way you always did.

16:04.336 --> 16:06.930
I know, but I'm gonna
to be thinking...

16:07.131 --> 16:09.192
Well, you know what I'm
gonna be thinking.

16:09.216 --> 16:11.611
Well, speak of the devil.

16:11.635 --> 16:14.104
Hey, Nina. What are
you doing here?

16:14.388 --> 16:18.025
Julia told me she had a class with
you, so I thought I'd follow her.

16:35.701 --> 16:36.960
Bill?

16:36.994 --> 16:38.837
What do you think of
the new uniform, huh?

16:38.954 --> 16:41.266
It's sporty.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.549
Yeah, isn't it?

16:43.417 --> 16:45.594
So what brings you in here?

16:45.920 --> 16:47.429
You don't come on till 5:00.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.139
Yeah, well...

16:49.256 --> 16:51.225
I suddenly have a lot
of time on my hands.

16:51.884 --> 16:55.395
In fact, uh, I was wondering
if I could take on more hours.

16:56.305 --> 16:58.816
Sure. Let me get you a uniform.

17:06.565 --> 17:07.782
Here you go.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.159
This ought to fit you.

17:10.027 --> 17:12.538
So these extra hours
just for this week?

17:12.905 --> 17:14.039
No.

17:14.281 --> 17:15.665
Every week.

17:16.951 --> 17:18.961
The rest of my miserable life.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.300
Hey.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.594
How's the head?

17:28.754 --> 17:30.764
Just the person I
wanted to speak to.

17:31.549 --> 17:32.651
About last night...

17:32.675 --> 17:34.518
Yeah, about that.

17:34.843 --> 17:37.062
I couldn't help
noticing that, uh...

17:37.179 --> 17:38.939
You seem to have forgiven me.

17:39.807 --> 17:43.819
Exactly how did I...

17:44.645 --> 17:46.697
Demonstrate that forgiveness?

17:48.440 --> 17:50.993
In no ways that you have any
reason to be embarrassed about.

17:51.068 --> 17:52.286
I knew that.

17:55.906 --> 17:57.541
Anyway, I'm still mad at you.

17:59.827 --> 18:01.169
But, um...

18:01.453 --> 18:02.921
...we're adults, right?

18:04.206 --> 18:08.969
We can move past
that, and, uh...

18:09.795 --> 18:14.766
Acknowledge an obvious
mutual attraction.

18:32.943 --> 18:35.621
Um, wait, Charlie. I don't
think we should do this here.

18:36.363 --> 18:37.998
Why not here? Here's good.

18:38.282 --> 18:41.460
Because, it's too distracting.

18:42.286 --> 18:45.432
I can't do this with you and take
care of Owen at the same time.

18:45.456 --> 18:47.049
He's cool with it. I asked him.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.343
This is my job.

18:49.585 --> 18:51.855
I wouldn't ask you to fool
around at Salinger's.

18:51.879 --> 18:53.189
I know, but we can
fix that about you.

18:53.213 --> 18:54.640
No, really.

18:55.049 --> 18:58.769
Anything between us has to
happen outside this house.

19:01.513 --> 19:03.065
You're serious, aren't you?

19:03.223 --> 19:04.900
I'm afraid so.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.361
But, um...

19:08.354 --> 19:09.696
I'm free tonight.

19:10.773 --> 19:12.074
I'm working.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.827
But Joe owes me time.

19:16.153 --> 19:17.746
I'll get off early.

19:18.364 --> 19:19.998
Come by the restaurant
for dinner.

19:20.282 --> 19:21.416
Okay.

19:25.788 --> 19:27.214
You know, um...

19:36.465 --> 19:37.683
What?

19:38.384 --> 19:40.435
Nothing. It's, it's stupid.

19:41.845 --> 19:43.063
Tell me.

19:44.306 --> 19:45.482
I, um...

19:46.225 --> 19:48.735
I used to get dragged to
church when I was little,

19:48.852 --> 19:50.789
and, uh, I hated it,

19:50.813 --> 19:53.865
so I'd just stare at the
angels on the ceiling,

19:54.942 --> 19:56.868
and they always had this...

19:58.112 --> 19:59.631
Beautiful goldish hair.

19:59.655 --> 20:00.914
Like yours.

20:01.615 --> 20:05.460
So you just reminded me
of an angel, I guess.

20:08.247 --> 20:09.631
That's really nice.

20:13.252 --> 20:14.761
I hate this rule.

20:19.133 --> 20:20.267
Okay.

20:21.635 --> 20:25.448
These are the racquetball,
and these are the tennis.

20:25.472 --> 20:27.190
What if I want to power walk?

20:27.683 --> 20:30.235
Up the hill, you
know, for cardio?

20:31.311 --> 20:32.612
A walking shoe.

20:33.397 --> 20:36.283
And clean this stuff up, huh? I
can't think with all these boxes.

21:03.969 --> 21:05.729
Excuse me. Do you work here?

21:07.973 --> 21:10.567
No, you just wear
that for fun, right?

21:10.851 --> 21:12.069
Smart, Kate.

21:12.227 --> 21:15.155
Oh, it's a common mistake.

21:15.481 --> 21:16.740
How can I help you?

21:16.774 --> 21:18.366
I need new running shoes.

21:18.776 --> 21:21.536
Nothing fancy, you know,
just something reliable.

21:21.737 --> 21:22.954
Excuse me.

21:23.030 --> 21:24.331
Hello?

21:25.616 --> 21:28.001
Power walkers? I was here first.

21:29.119 --> 21:31.213
Yes, you were.

21:32.206 --> 21:33.465
So...

21:34.583 --> 21:35.801
So...

21:36.168 --> 21:37.520
- Bill?
- Yeah?

21:37.544 --> 21:40.680
Uh, this nice woman would like to
see some power walkers, size nine?

21:41.924 --> 21:43.433
He'll be helping you now.

21:45.093 --> 21:48.688
So, uh, nothing fancy,
just something reliable.

21:49.473 --> 21:50.816
I think I can help you.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.995
What are you doing
home so early?

21:54.019 --> 21:56.456
You always seem to have such
a full social calendar.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.959
Not today. Everyone's busy.
With their boyfriends mostly.

21:59.983 --> 22:03.453
Oh, the old "get a boyfriend
and dump your friends" thing.

22:03.654 --> 22:04.996
It's okay.

22:05.489 --> 22:07.634
If I had a boyfriend,
I'd do the same thing.

22:07.658 --> 22:10.293
I bet you tons of guys
want to go out with you.

22:10.577 --> 22:11.920
Actually, just one.

22:12.788 --> 22:14.682
Not exactly the
love of your life?

22:14.706 --> 22:17.185
No, but you know, so what?

22:17.209 --> 22:18.885
Who says you have to be in love?

22:19.086 --> 22:21.763
Everyone says it's not so
good the first time anyway.

22:24.591 --> 22:26.184
Are we talking about sex?

22:26.426 --> 22:30.272
Yeah, I mean, why not just get it over
with? At least then you've done it.

22:30.347 --> 22:32.951
You know, it's, it's
not really my place

22:32.975 --> 22:34.526
to tell you how
to approach this,

22:34.893 --> 22:38.822
but if you're confused, you
should talk to your brother.

22:39.648 --> 22:40.750
Charlie?

22:40.774 --> 22:42.252
Great.

22:42.276 --> 22:43.962
He'd help. He's been through it.

22:43.986 --> 22:46.204
Yeah. About eight million times.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.091
This is love as
Charlie knows it...

22:48.115 --> 22:52.095
Invite a girl over, give her
one of his famous lines like,

22:52.119 --> 22:53.346
"your skin is like silk,"

22:53.370 --> 22:55.338
or "your hair reminds
me of an angel,"

22:55.414 --> 22:57.308
convince her to sleep
with him in his van,

22:57.332 --> 22:58.768
and then never call her again.

22:58.792 --> 23:01.303
Not exactly the most
sensitive guy on earth.

23:01.545 --> 23:02.804
Kirsten,

23:03.005 --> 23:04.816
isn't it weird that
men have an average

23:04.840 --> 23:07.402
of eight sexual partners
by the time they're 30

23:07.426 --> 23:09.352
and women only have three?

23:09.928 --> 23:11.563
Yes, Claudia.

23:11.930 --> 23:13.356
It's very weird.

23:19.229 --> 23:21.781
I don't know. What do you think?

23:23.108 --> 23:24.168
Honestly?

23:24.192 --> 23:26.212
Get the cheap ones.
They're just as good.

23:26.236 --> 23:27.130
Really?

23:27.154 --> 23:31.124
Yeah, except with these, you pay
15 bucks for the fancy colors.

23:31.742 --> 23:34.336
Couldn't you get in trouble
giving that kind of advice?

23:34.411 --> 23:36.296
Not if you don't tell anyone.

23:37.414 --> 23:40.508
I'll take these terribly
expensive running shoes, please.

23:41.585 --> 23:42.761
Fine.

23:50.093 --> 23:51.394
Okay...

23:54.973 --> 23:58.568
All right, Kate.
That'll be $58.46.

23:59.353 --> 24:00.538
How did you know my name?

24:00.562 --> 24:03.448
You said it. "Smart, Kate."

24:04.149 --> 24:05.700
Oh, that's right.

24:06.568 --> 24:07.869
Well...

24:08.987 --> 24:10.789
Thanks for the shoes...

24:11.365 --> 24:12.582
Bailey.

24:18.038 --> 24:19.839
You should've gotten her number.

24:20.374 --> 24:21.716
It's okay.

24:22.084 --> 24:23.343
She'll be back.

24:24.961 --> 24:26.972
Hey, Justin, it's me.

24:27.839 --> 24:29.724
Listen, what's the
chem assignment?

24:31.218 --> 24:32.435
Uh-huh.

24:33.762 --> 24:34.938
Okay.

24:35.889 --> 24:37.941
You know, I was thinking
about that movie.

24:38.975 --> 24:40.443
About going.

24:41.269 --> 24:43.071
Yeah, well, with you.

24:44.856 --> 24:46.866
You don't have to
sound so surprised.

24:50.612 --> 24:53.581
Oh, you probably don't
want to see it again.

24:55.992 --> 24:57.252
You sure?

24:58.370 --> 24:59.504
Great.

24:59.746 --> 25:00.922
Cool.

25:01.164 --> 25:02.674
Okay, well, uh...

25:02.916 --> 25:04.884
Yeah, I'll see you then.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.678
Bye.

25:20.976 --> 25:22.819
I thought someone
was meeting you.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.196
So did I.

25:38.618 --> 25:40.555
You want to tell me why
I waited like an idiot

25:40.579 --> 25:41.764
for an hour and a
half last night?

25:41.788 --> 25:44.299
What makes you angrier,
you had to wait,

25:44.374 --> 25:46.217
or you didn't get
me into your van?

25:46.334 --> 25:47.603
What do you mean?
I sold the van.

25:47.627 --> 25:49.731
I'm speaking
metaphorically, Charlie.

25:49.755 --> 25:51.441
You understand metaphor.

25:51.465 --> 25:55.101
"Your hair is like an
angel's." That's metaphor.

25:57.387 --> 25:58.448
How did you know?

25:58.472 --> 25:59.449
That's irrelevant.

25:59.473 --> 26:02.744
What matters is that I have no desire
to be one of your many conquests.

26:02.768 --> 26:03.661
I don't want that.

26:03.685 --> 26:04.620
Neither do I.

26:04.644 --> 26:06.080
Well, then why did you
use that stupid line?

26:06.104 --> 26:07.457
- I don't know!
- Well, I do!

26:07.481 --> 26:09.324
No, wait. Look...

26:11.276 --> 26:13.453
Yes, all right, it's a line.

26:13.945 --> 26:15.214
I... I just...

26:15.238 --> 26:17.383
I guess I didn't know
what else to say.

26:17.407 --> 26:19.385
I mean, I knew I wanted
to say something nice,

26:19.409 --> 26:21.294
and I knew that was
nice, so I said it.

26:21.536 --> 26:25.099
Doesn't that happen to you, where you
just kind of don't have the words?

26:25.123 --> 26:26.142
Rarely.

26:26.166 --> 26:28.301
Well, excuse me.
I'm not perfect.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.481
I mean, I... I mean, yeah.

26:31.505 --> 26:35.266
Sure, I haven't always been a
saint when it comes to girls.

26:35.383 --> 26:37.185
But this isn't...

26:37.219 --> 26:39.572
I mean, that's, that's,
that's not what this is.

26:39.596 --> 26:42.649
You're, you know, you're
completely different.

26:44.017 --> 26:45.360
Not an angel?

26:45.477 --> 26:47.153
So not an angel.

26:50.816 --> 26:51.950
Okay?

26:54.027 --> 26:55.286
Pretty okay.

26:56.238 --> 26:57.872
Okay enough to try dinner again?

26:59.199 --> 27:00.458
We could.

27:01.451 --> 27:02.627
Tonight?

27:03.954 --> 27:05.213
All right.

27:06.706 --> 27:08.976
Did you know that
60 million sperms

27:09.000 --> 27:12.095
are deposited in a woman every
time she has intercourse?

27:12.462 --> 27:14.681
60 million!

27:15.257 --> 27:17.475
She's been obsessed
with sex lately.

27:17.551 --> 27:18.893
I'm hoping it goes away.

27:19.553 --> 27:20.812
What, by itself?

27:20.887 --> 27:22.021
Yeah.

27:23.265 --> 27:24.325
No?

27:24.349 --> 27:29.237
Charlie, she's confused. She needs someone
to talk to, answer her questions.

27:29.312 --> 27:30.248
Yeah, but...

27:30.272 --> 27:33.042
By not talking about it,
you're sending her a message

27:33.066 --> 27:36.077
that sex is something bad
or shameful or dirty.

27:37.529 --> 27:40.248
Wait, don't stop. That,
that was working for me.

27:42.409 --> 27:44.794
<i>Pharmacy, pick up line two.</i>

27:47.289 --> 27:48.756
There's so many kinds.

27:49.541 --> 27:51.926
It's like shampoo.
How do you choose?

27:53.128 --> 27:54.856
Well, I guess you just
have to try out a bunch

27:54.880 --> 27:57.348
and see which one you like best.

28:01.428 --> 28:02.687
Mint.

28:06.725 --> 28:09.412
Well, I guess which one you use
can make a big difference,

28:09.436 --> 28:12.280
you know, like, make it
better or something.

28:19.404 --> 28:20.673
Is there something
you're not telling me?

28:20.697 --> 28:24.260
No, it's just always best
to be prepared, you know.

28:24.284 --> 28:25.668
Just in case.

28:29.247 --> 28:30.757
I'm so proud of you.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.394
Excuse me.

28:33.418 --> 28:36.012
Can I help... hey!

28:36.880 --> 28:39.567
Someone made a mistake.
These shoes don't match.

28:39.591 --> 28:41.819
I don't know how this
could've happened.

28:41.843 --> 28:43.228
Shocking, isn't it?

28:43.386 --> 28:46.616
I'm really sorry you had to
come all the way down here.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.108
Don't sweat it. I had to meet
someone down here anyway.

28:50.268 --> 28:52.997
Why, this is just... this
is just inexcusable.

28:53.021 --> 28:55.625
I just, I... Boy, I just...

28:55.649 --> 28:56.918
I feel awful.

28:56.942 --> 28:59.295
Look, you have to let
me make this up to you.

28:59.319 --> 29:00.296
It's no big deal.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.664
Oh, sure, for you maybe,
but what about for me?

29:02.739 --> 29:08.169
I mean, if this ever got out... if Consumer
Affairs ever found out about this,

29:08.245 --> 29:10.306
I could be stripped of my
license to sell shoes.

29:10.330 --> 29:11.849
They wouldn't dream of it.

29:11.873 --> 29:13.591
No, don't you doubt
it for a minute.

29:14.125 --> 29:17.146
So, you see, it's crucial that
you let me make this up to you.

29:17.170 --> 29:19.305
Now, what are you
doing right now?

29:20.006 --> 29:21.266
Hmm.

29:22.133 --> 29:23.643
- Oh, I don't...
- Please.

29:24.970 --> 29:26.688
My career depends on it.

29:28.890 --> 29:30.483
No, I can't, I'm going out.

29:30.517 --> 29:32.828
- Just talk to her
for five minutes.

29:32.852 --> 29:34.413
Look, if you don't, she's
gonna get the idea

29:34.437 --> 29:37.250
that sex is something bad
or shameful or dirty.

29:37.274 --> 29:39.043
If it's so important,
why don't you do it?

29:39.067 --> 29:40.461
I got some Tylenol.

29:40.485 --> 29:43.089
I hope it works. He's
been crying for hours.

29:43.113 --> 29:45.841
Sometimes the fever just stays
up till the tooth breaks.

29:45.865 --> 29:47.625
How long does that take?

29:47.659 --> 29:49.178
It could be hours,
it could be days.

29:49.202 --> 29:50.920
He could be like this for days?

29:50.954 --> 29:52.890
Don't worry. I'll stay with him.

29:52.914 --> 29:54.757
But didn't you have
plans tonight?

29:55.292 --> 29:56.435
They can be rescheduled.

29:56.459 --> 29:59.272
No. I won't let you do that.

29:59.296 --> 30:03.057
Charlie, she's a grown-up.
She can do what she wants.

30:07.929 --> 30:09.865
So, six sugars, huh?

30:09.889 --> 30:12.191
- Thank you.
- Care much about your teeth?

30:12.392 --> 30:13.860
I floss daily.

30:14.352 --> 30:16.237
So, do you live near here?

30:16.771 --> 30:17.989
Sometimes.

30:18.231 --> 30:21.919
My parents are divorced, so
I split time between them...

30:21.943 --> 30:23.587
one week with her,
one week with him.

30:23.611 --> 30:24.588
Oh, that's neat.

30:24.612 --> 30:26.331
It's a nightmare.

30:26.364 --> 30:27.790
That's what I meant.

30:28.491 --> 30:30.469
Especially now in
cross-country season.

30:30.493 --> 30:33.389
It's one big psychodrama
every weekend.

30:33.413 --> 30:35.016
What, at... at races?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.310
Yeah. I guess all
four of my parents

30:37.334 --> 30:39.312
must've read the same
book on being supportive,

30:39.336 --> 30:42.055
because now they're all
showing up at my meets.

30:42.505 --> 30:45.183
Well, so then you have your
own big cheering section.

30:45.550 --> 30:46.485
That's cool.

30:46.509 --> 30:49.822
Yeah, until I finish and they
all want to congratulate me.

30:49.846 --> 30:51.991
If I hug my mom first,
my dad gets hurt.

30:52.015 --> 30:53.868
If I hug my dad first,
my mom gets hurt,

30:53.892 --> 30:55.369
and if I hug my
stepfather first,

30:55.393 --> 30:57.236
Mom and Dad both get hurt.

30:57.437 --> 31:00.823
Thank God my stepmother's a
cold fish who hates hugging.

31:02.150 --> 31:04.452
I take it your parents
aren't divorced.

31:05.278 --> 31:07.955
Um, no.

31:08.698 --> 31:11.000
It must be nice to
have a normal family.

31:12.535 --> 31:15.213
Um, it's...

31:16.373 --> 31:18.341
It's not exactly normal.

31:19.376 --> 31:21.177
What's not normal about it?

31:23.046 --> 31:24.472
I've got to go.

31:26.716 --> 31:27.934
Who's that?

31:28.551 --> 31:30.019
That's Tom.

31:30.345 --> 31:31.688
My boyfriend.

31:33.348 --> 31:34.899
This was really sweet.

31:36.017 --> 31:37.193
What was?

31:37.394 --> 31:39.779
Just all of it.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.532
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

31:42.732 --> 31:43.950
Okay.

32:03.670 --> 32:06.357
I think I was more scared by the
audience screaming than the movie.

32:06.381 --> 32:08.067
Yeah, before, when I came,

32:08.091 --> 32:10.111
this woman screeched in my
ear the whole two hours.

32:10.135 --> 32:11.654
You should've heard it.

32:11.678 --> 32:13.020
I'm glad I didn't.

32:13.471 --> 32:15.356
I didn't want to come
with a big group.

32:16.433 --> 32:18.276
I wanted to come with you.

32:24.691 --> 32:26.117
I thought you didn't like me.

32:34.784 --> 32:36.461
God, girls are hard to read.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.090
Come here.

32:53.386 --> 32:55.396
We're right in the
middle of the street.

32:56.473 --> 32:57.857
You can come over.

33:01.102 --> 33:02.079
My parents.

33:02.103 --> 33:04.206
They'd wait up for me.

33:04.230 --> 33:05.490
They always do.

33:06.983 --> 33:08.618
But, uh, we could...

33:08.776 --> 33:11.964
...tomorrow they have their bridge night.
They'll be out until midnight.

33:11.988 --> 33:14.165
Uh, we could go out.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.792
Or I'll just come over.

33:16.117 --> 33:18.211
Yeah or that.

33:25.001 --> 33:26.177
Look.

33:26.503 --> 33:28.805
There's that moron
from our chem class.

33:29.088 --> 33:30.566
What's his name, Drew?

33:30.590 --> 33:32.433
Jeez, somebody get them a room.

33:34.093 --> 33:35.436
Hey, Nin...

33:48.983 --> 33:50.159
Pillow?

33:52.153 --> 33:54.163
If I get a fever, will you
spend the night in my room?

33:54.864 --> 33:56.040
I promise.

34:02.330 --> 34:03.923
Here you go. Take this one.

34:03.957 --> 34:06.467
Thanks for the bed, Bailey.
I really appreciate it.

34:06.709 --> 34:07.885
No sweat.

34:22.891 --> 34:24.150
Hey, Charlie?

34:24.851 --> 34:27.446
You ever get the feeling the
Gods just don't like us?

34:31.859 --> 34:33.286
All the time, Bay.

34:33.735 --> 34:35.329
All the time.

34:44.789 --> 34:46.391
So she's got a boyfriend.

34:46.416 --> 34:47.976
There are a lot of
others who don't.

34:48.001 --> 34:49.228
She's better than the others.

34:49.252 --> 34:51.469
Yeah, well, they all seem better
when you first meet them.

34:51.629 --> 34:53.139
Well, so what, Will?

34:53.172 --> 34:55.900
So what if I'm just imagining
that going out with her

34:55.925 --> 34:59.071
would make this whole stupid
football season tolerable?

34:59.095 --> 35:00.072
I just meant...

35:00.096 --> 35:02.148
And you know what
really pisses me off?

35:02.265 --> 35:05.160
I bet you anything that this
boyfriend is one of those guys

35:05.184 --> 35:07.778
who gets whatever he wants,
no matter what he does.

35:08.396 --> 35:11.125
Guys like that, they could
kill the pope or something,

35:11.149 --> 35:12.992
and everything would
still go their way.

35:13.568 --> 35:16.255
And then there's me. I
always do the right thing,

35:16.279 --> 35:18.706
and nothing I want
to happen, happens.

35:19.574 --> 35:20.884
You could try to steal her away.

35:20.908 --> 35:22.428
Bailey's not that kind of guy.

35:22.452 --> 35:25.598
What? What, I'm more the "lie
there and take it" kind?

35:25.622 --> 35:27.224
Chill out, Bailey. I
meant it in a good way.

35:27.248 --> 35:29.101
Well, why shouldn't I
keep trying for her?

35:29.125 --> 35:31.270
Yeah, why shouldn't he?

35:31.294 --> 35:33.147
Girls switch boyfriends
all the time.

35:33.171 --> 35:34.148
Well, what are you gonna do?

35:34.172 --> 35:37.234
Just call her up and tell her to break
up with him and go out with you instead?

35:37.258 --> 35:38.652
No, I'm gonna, you know...

35:38.676 --> 35:41.864
I'm just gonna... hang
around her a lot.

35:41.888 --> 35:45.618
Yeah. You know... Just
be there all the time.

35:45.642 --> 35:46.817
Yeah.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.819
Gee, why didn't I think of that?

35:49.145 --> 35:51.614
And then, you know, eventually
she'll fall for me.

35:51.731 --> 35:53.407
Like a ton of bricks.

35:53.691 --> 35:55.201
And why is that again?

35:55.735 --> 35:57.078
Duh.

35:57.445 --> 35:58.746
He's Bailey.

36:04.452 --> 36:05.346
How's Owen?

36:05.370 --> 36:07.755
Tooth's in, fever's down.
We're in the clear.

36:08.206 --> 36:10.517
I'm off tonight, so as soon
as you're finished here...

36:10.541 --> 36:11.518
We'll have dinner at my place.

36:11.542 --> 36:13.520
This is great. No!

36:13.544 --> 36:17.024
What? No! Get out of it!
Swap with someone!

36:17.048 --> 36:18.432
I can't. We have a deal.

36:18.508 --> 36:19.725
I'm not happy.

36:25.890 --> 36:28.484
You know, this thing's not gonna
work if no one remembers to turn it.

36:31.062 --> 36:32.947
- It's your turn?
- Uh-huh.

36:36.484 --> 36:38.494
So you two can finally
have some privacy.

36:41.322 --> 36:42.623
You talk in your sleep.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.088
Bailey, wait a sec.

36:50.206 --> 36:51.507
Wait a sec.

36:52.542 --> 36:53.801
You're okay with this?

36:54.377 --> 36:55.553
Yeah.

36:56.045 --> 36:58.982
I don't know, Charlie, I mean,
I thought about what you said

36:59.006 --> 37:01.017
about the age stuff.

37:01.718 --> 37:02.893
I think you were right.

37:04.345 --> 37:05.479
Really?

37:05.847 --> 37:08.065
And besides, I met someone.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.526
She's, uh...

37:12.061 --> 37:13.279
She's...

37:17.859 --> 37:19.410
And she's 16.

37:21.946 --> 37:23.914
He promised that
we'd do something,

37:25.032 --> 37:28.753
and when I tried him at 11:00 at
night, his Mom said he was out.

37:31.706 --> 37:33.340
Did you talk to him today?

37:33.666 --> 37:35.676
Mmm-mmm. No.

37:37.336 --> 37:39.013
He was at practice.

37:40.923 --> 37:42.141
Jerk.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.525
It's not just that he's
dumping me, you know,

37:52.477 --> 37:54.028
because I could deal with that.

37:56.022 --> 37:57.656
But I slept with him.

38:00.109 --> 38:03.797
I mean, I thought that I
really mattered to him,

38:03.821 --> 38:06.165
but all he wanted to
do was sleep with me.

38:08.367 --> 38:09.710
Maybe not, Nina.

38:10.745 --> 38:12.473
I'm not a total idiot, Julia.

38:12.497 --> 38:15.174
I know what it means when
someone doesn't call.

38:17.084 --> 38:18.260
I don't...

38:19.378 --> 38:21.597
I just don't get how
he could do that.

38:22.465 --> 38:24.610
I mean, I would never
do what he did.

38:24.634 --> 38:26.977
I'd never take advantage
of someone like that.

38:28.513 --> 38:29.814
And the thing is...

38:32.225 --> 38:34.360
I really liked him, you know?

38:43.569 --> 38:46.413
I'm not trying to put
anything over on you, sir.

38:46.697 --> 38:48.457
I just need the afternoon off.

38:48.616 --> 38:50.376
Well, I'm sorry, son.

38:51.077 --> 38:53.879
I'm running a business
here, not a social center.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.340
People that work for me,
they understand that.

38:56.624 --> 38:57.925
They follow through.

38:58.042 --> 39:00.511
People who work for me, they don't
shirk their responsibilities.

39:02.672 --> 39:04.390
Well, I guess that
counts me out.

39:05.550 --> 39:06.809
What's that?

39:07.635 --> 39:09.311
I'll return the
uniform tomorrow.

39:11.305 --> 39:15.693
And while we're on the subject,
these uniforms, they're not sporty.

39:15.935 --> 39:17.361
They're ridiculous.

39:32.952 --> 39:34.211
How are the shoes?

39:34.328 --> 39:35.472
Barley.

39:35.496 --> 39:36.598
Bailey.

39:36.622 --> 39:37.850
What are you doing here?

39:37.874 --> 39:39.800
I thought I'd take up running.

39:46.591 --> 39:48.017
She's crazy about me.

39:58.769 --> 40:00.279
Are you all right, Julia?

40:03.065 --> 40:05.451
What? What's the matter?

40:12.450 --> 40:14.543
You're a great guy, Justin.

40:18.122 --> 40:20.341
I mean, you know that.
It's just...

40:21.709 --> 40:22.927
It's just...

40:30.343 --> 40:31.904
It's not like I begged you.

40:31.928 --> 40:33.103
I know.

40:37.934 --> 40:39.276
I'm sorry.

40:43.189 --> 40:45.658
- You kissed me, you know?
- I know.

40:48.819 --> 40:51.288
Why'd you ask to come
over in the first place?

40:56.035 --> 40:57.586
I guess I just...

41:00.456 --> 41:02.383
...wanted to be with someone.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.637
Well, you should have picked somebody
that didn't really like you...

41:09.423 --> 41:12.643
...because pretending to like
somebody back when you don't...

41:15.846 --> 41:18.315
...it's not fair.

41:18.474 --> 41:19.692
I know.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.238
That's why I'm telling you now.

41:28.484 --> 41:30.536
Well, thanks.

41:40.246 --> 41:41.422
Claud?

41:47.461 --> 41:48.679
Yeah?

41:49.005 --> 41:50.222
Can I come in?

41:51.257 --> 41:52.433
Sure.

41:58.556 --> 42:00.691
Wow. It's nice in here.

42:01.308 --> 42:03.235
It can sleep two
to three adults.

42:15.865 --> 42:17.791
I was thinking about
those questions you had.

42:21.704 --> 42:22.973
You know, about...

42:22.997 --> 42:24.214
Sex?

42:24.832 --> 42:26.008
Yeah.

42:28.002 --> 42:30.512
Truth is, I don't know
that much about it.

42:33.549 --> 42:35.642
But if you want to
ask me anything,

42:37.011 --> 42:38.645
I'll try and answer, okay?

42:41.182 --> 42:42.399
Well,

42:44.894 --> 42:46.737
when a man and woman,

42:48.230 --> 42:52.951
when they, you know,
they get together?

42:55.696 --> 42:56.955
Does it hurt?

43:00.910 --> 43:02.294
Sometimes, Claud.

43:03.996 --> 43:05.923
Yeah, sometimes.

43:13.672 --> 43:16.266
<i>That makes everything
quite all right.</i>

43:16.675 --> 43:17.851
<i>What, this?</i>

43:21.055 --> 43:22.824
<i>Well, I like privacy
when I retire.</i>

43:22.848 --> 43:24.785
<i>Yes, I'm very delicate
in that respect.</i>

43:24.809 --> 43:26.443
<i>Prying eyes annoy me.</i>

43:26.769 --> 43:28.737
When was the last time
you checked on him?

43:30.064 --> 43:31.240
Uh-huh.

43:33.442 --> 43:34.785
Still, no fever?

43:37.404 --> 43:38.914
And he's sleeping okay?

43:41.408 --> 43:42.543
Great.
