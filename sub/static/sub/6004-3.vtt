PETER: Oh, man, I thought this map

00:07.644 --> 00:09.178
would lead us right to the Cosmic Seed.

00:09.179 --> 00:10.513
GAMORA: You thought?
(ROARING)

00:10.514 --> 00:12.114
Hey, when you're tracking

00:12.115 --> 00:14.049
one of the most powerful
artifacts in the universe,

00:14.050 --> 00:15.317
you play a few hunches.

00:15.318 --> 00:17.019
Was it a hunch when you unleashed

00:17.020 --> 00:19.021
what was trapped in that cave, Quill?

00:19.022 --> 00:21.423
It's not my fault, Drax.

00:21.424 --> 00:23.292
Maps don't lie.

00:25.195 --> 00:27.162
I am Groot?

00:28.098 --> 00:30.466
Oh!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.801
PETER: You could've told me I
had it upside-down the whole time.

00:32.802 --> 00:35.538
Which you probably did,
but your furry partner

00:35.539 --> 00:37.606
never bothered to translate!

00:39.809 --> 00:42.311
Rocket, the shields aren't recharging.

00:42.312 --> 00:44.046
Yeah, yeah, Gamora...

00:44.047 --> 00:45.514
Rocket, we need speed! Stat!

00:45.515 --> 00:47.283
All right, already!

00:47.284 --> 00:50.519
Rocket, targeting system
is not functioning. Rocket!

00:50.520 --> 00:51.787
PETER: Rocket!
- GAMORA: Rocket!

00:51.788 --> 00:53.222
DRAX: Rocket!
- PETER: Rocket!

00:53.223 --> 00:55.057
I am Groot!
- Hey!

00:55.058 --> 00:56.225
No need to get personal.

00:56.226 --> 00:58.427
I can't fix four things at once!

00:58.428 --> 01:00.229
You wouldn't have to fix any of them

01:00.230 --> 01:01.363
if you didn't keep borrowing parts

01:01.364 --> 01:02.765
for your useless gadgets.

01:02.766 --> 01:04.566
I wouldn't have to borrow parts

01:04.568 --> 01:07.536
if I had decent supplies
to work with on this junker.

01:07.537 --> 01:09.505
Besides, who wouldn't want a neck massager

01:09.506 --> 01:10.606
for the pilot's seat?

01:10.607 --> 01:12.207
(VIBRATING)

01:12.208 --> 01:14.243
What? Takes the edge off.

01:14.244 --> 01:16.612
You want me to fix it? I'll fix it.

01:16.613 --> 01:18.080
(YELLS)

01:18.081 --> 01:19.114
Hey, what're you doing?

01:22.619 --> 01:25.421
(ALL SCREAM)

01:25.422 --> 01:28.457
Uh, Rocket? You do realize
we're heading straight

01:28.458 --> 01:30.626
for the big, cranky dragon thing, right?

01:33.163 --> 01:34.363
Rocket.

01:34.364 --> 01:35.531
Rocket!

01:35.532 --> 01:37.266

02:03.026 --> 02:04.961
PETER: Yeah, but you got us, too.

02:07.731 --> 02:08.997
ROCKET: "Nice maneuver, Rocket."

02:08.999 --> 02:10.733
"Quick thinking, Rocket."

02:10.734 --> 02:13.736
"Thanks for saving our
worthless hides, Rocket."

02:13.737 --> 02:16.038
(SCOFFS) Would a little gratitude kill you?

02:16.039 --> 02:17.807
Okay, give me a quantum ratchet

02:17.808 --> 02:19.242
with a reverse flange.

02:19.243 --> 02:21.110
I am Groot?

02:26.717 --> 02:28.751
S'matter,
sap-for-brains?

02:28.752 --> 02:31.154
Don't you know a fusion
wrench from a sonic spanner?

02:31.155 --> 02:34.390
Do not speak so harshly
at our leafy companion.

02:34.391 --> 02:35.825
He's my best friend.

02:35.826 --> 02:37.960
I'll speak to him any way I want.

02:41.732 --> 02:42.732
You dropped something.

02:42.733 --> 02:45.101
How 'bout I drop you? (SNARLS)

02:57.347 --> 02:59.415

03:27.878 --> 03:29.745
Now what'd you do this time?

03:29.746 --> 03:30.713
Don't blame me.

03:30.714 --> 03:32.181
It was the tree.

03:32.182 --> 03:34.784
Who wouldn't know an
airlock from a knothole. Huh?

03:34.785 --> 03:38.221
PETER: I'm guessing that's
not Roadside Assistance.

03:38.222 --> 03:40.289
ROCKET: More like Roadside Kidnapping!

03:45.762 --> 03:47.897
Okay, you could put us down anytime...

03:47.898 --> 03:49.098
Whoa, not now!

03:50.100 --> 03:51.167
(GRUNTING)

03:54.037 --> 03:56.772
Hello? Anyone here?

04:02.913 --> 04:04.947
Whoa, at least buy me dinner first.

04:04.948 --> 04:06.215
They are merely scanning us

04:06.216 --> 04:07.917
for signs of intelligence.

04:07.918 --> 04:09.085
GAMORA: They won't find any on Quill.

04:17.894 --> 04:20.896
Hey, my ship!

04:23.867 --> 04:26.836
(SCOFFS) Good riddance to bad trash.

04:28.105 --> 04:29.805
I am Groot!

04:34.044 --> 04:36.846
Drax, watch the left. Gamora, take right.

04:36.847 --> 04:38.014
Rocket, check our six.

04:40.817 --> 04:42.852
Uh, you forgot "up," genius.

04:49.826 --> 04:51.127
Hey, we know that guy.

04:51.128 --> 04:52.895
Collector dude, right?

04:52.896 --> 04:54.563
"Land-Lord," was it?

04:54.564 --> 04:56.866
Star-Lord.
Star-Lord!

04:56.867 --> 04:59.302
Hey, what's the big idea
of tearing up my ship?

04:59.303 --> 05:04.106
I thought I was looting... Uh,
salvaging a derelict spaceship.

05:04.107 --> 05:05.308
I mean, look at it.

05:05.309 --> 05:09.045
You can understand the confusion.

05:09.046 --> 05:10.446
That's just harsh.

05:10.447 --> 05:13.115
We were making repairs
when you scooped us up.

05:13.116 --> 05:14.517
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a spare

05:14.518 --> 05:17.019
Mark Five Oscillation
Overthruster, would you?

05:22.959 --> 05:25.261
COLLECTOR: I am sure I
have everything you need

05:25.262 --> 05:27.496
in my collection.

05:27.497 --> 05:30.433
Including the drones to make the repairs.

05:30.434 --> 05:34.970
Whoa. If I had access
to this kind of stash...

05:34.971 --> 05:37.139
Yeah, and if I had one
of those repair drones

05:37.140 --> 05:39.308
maybe stuff would stay fixed for a change.

05:39.309 --> 05:41.477
Hey! No bucket of bolts
knows its way around

05:41.478 --> 05:43.479
a bucket of bolts better than I do.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.515
Your tin can was trying to
connect the gyro-stabilizer

05:46.516 --> 05:49.418
to the accelatron. What a buffoon.

05:49.419 --> 05:54.390
You certainly are one of a kind.

05:54.391 --> 05:57.460
Ah, finally. Someone who appreciates

05:57.461 --> 05:59.128
the finer things in the galaxy.

05:59.129 --> 06:00.463
So, how much for that

06:00.464 --> 06:04.333
"osculation hovercruster" thing?

06:04.334 --> 06:07.103
Oh, I'm afraid nothing in
my collection is for sale.

06:07.104 --> 06:10.906
However, I will consider a trade.

06:10.907 --> 06:12.341
What kind of trade?

06:12.342 --> 06:15.878
I see you have a Spartaxian Cryptocube.

06:17.948 --> 06:21.283
Not for trade. Family
heirloom, can't part with it.

06:21.284 --> 06:22.952
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Pity.

06:22.953 --> 06:25.287
It appears to be incomplete.

06:25.288 --> 06:28.257
CryptoCubes require Pandorian crystals

06:28.258 --> 06:30.659
to unlock their secrets.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.928
(LAUGHING)

06:32.929 --> 06:35.264
Well, duh. Everyone knows that.

06:35.265 --> 06:37.433
Get a load of this guy.

06:37.434 --> 06:40.202
You wouldn't happen to have any
of those panda crystal thingies?

06:40.203 --> 06:42.671
Pandorian crystals?

06:42.672 --> 06:46.909
They are rare, but not unique
enough for my collection.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.645
However, I could direct you
to the location of a crystal

06:49.646 --> 06:52.481
and provide the repairs for your ship...

06:52.482 --> 06:55.217
in exchange for your technician.

06:55.218 --> 06:56.986
Huh? Say what, now?

06:56.987 --> 07:01.090
I could use someone with
your singular attributes.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.992
What do you say, Rocket, my friend?

07:02.993 --> 07:05.561
All this could be yours.

07:05.562 --> 07:07.630
Did I mention the free snacks?

07:08.698 --> 07:12.034
Are those pellets? Mmm!

07:12.035 --> 07:15.004
PETER: No way Rocket is just gonna up
and quit the Guardians of the Galaxy.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.673
ROCKET: I'll take the gig.

07:17.674 --> 07:20.075
(CRUNCHING) If you think a
toaster could do a better job

07:20.076 --> 07:24.046
keeping that hunk of junk
flying than me, be my guest.

07:24.047 --> 07:25.347
Oh, come on, I didn't mean

07:25.348 --> 07:28.083
that a robot is better than you.

07:28.084 --> 07:30.553
Less annoying, maybe?

07:30.554 --> 07:32.455
I have resisted the urge to feast

07:32.456 --> 07:35.624
on your roasted carcass, so far.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.460
Oh, now the love-fest starts.

07:37.461 --> 07:39.195
Before, it was "Rocket, do this,"

07:39.196 --> 07:41.997
and "Rocket, I need that!" Oh, forget it.

07:41.998 --> 07:44.166
I'm quitting you losers for good.

07:46.536 --> 07:49.038
I am Groot.

07:49.039 --> 07:51.974
I know, I'll miss you too, pal.

07:55.979 --> 07:58.314
I am Groot.

07:58.315 --> 07:59.982
'Course I won't forget you.

07:59.983 --> 08:02.084
Even though you were a lousy assistant.

08:02.085 --> 08:03.986
But my mind's made up.

08:06.122 --> 08:08.057
PETER: Not so fast.

08:08.058 --> 08:10.359
You can't just leave me high
and dry without my engineer.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.127
At least throw in one of
those fancy drone things.

08:14.130 --> 08:15.197
Um...

08:15.565 --> 08:16.732
Deal.

08:18.435 --> 08:20.236
So we're just gonna leave him here?

08:20.237 --> 08:22.238
Look, Rocket just needs time to cool off.

08:22.239 --> 08:25.207
By the time we grab that
crystal, he'll beg to come back.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.443
<i>All systems operational,
Captain Land-Lord, sir.</i>

08:27.444 --> 08:29.678
<i>I will be providing
coordinates to the crystal,</i>

08:29.679 --> 08:32.648
<i>as well as constant maintenance
on your fine spacecraft.</i>

08:32.649 --> 08:35.351
Besides, it's nice to get a
little respect for a change.

08:35.352 --> 08:38.287
And it's Star-Lord.
"Star-Lord."

08:42.626 --> 08:45.027
(BEEPING)

08:46.563 --> 08:48.797
I'm better off without those ingrates.

08:51.701 --> 08:53.602
Uh, what's with the badge?

08:53.603 --> 08:56.772
Oh, it's a passkey that grants
special access to the lab

08:56.773 --> 08:58.707
for your safety and convenience.

08:58.708 --> 09:02.611
By the way, have you seen my
collection of plasma canons?

09:04.814 --> 09:06.415

09:19.796 --> 09:21.430
But if your flower's any indication,

09:21.431 --> 09:23.198
at least he's happy.

09:33.643 --> 09:34.710

09:34.711 --> 09:36.412

Thanks, Droney.

09:43.186 --> 09:46.722
<i>As promised, a Pandorian crystal deposit.</i>

09:46.723 --> 09:48.223
Rock on. You know what?

09:48.224 --> 09:49.758
Maybe this wasn't such
a bad deal after all.

09:55.265 --> 09:56.198
(ROARING)

09:56.199 --> 09:57.266
Uh...

09:59.703 --> 10:01.203
Is that...

10:01.204 --> 10:02.438
A mouth?

10:03.707 --> 10:05.274
Aw, seriously?

10:11.715 --> 10:13.282
The Collector totally played us.

10:13.283 --> 10:14.850
I can't believe I fell for that.

10:23.827 --> 10:25.127
Hang on!

10:26.830 --> 10:29.131
Gonna have to drill those molars.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.193
It's digesting us.

10:58.194 --> 10:59.395
We need tech support.

11:13.877 --> 11:15.878
<i>Leave a message. Or don't.</i>

<i>See if I care.</i>

11:17.914 --> 11:19.882
(ALL GROANING)

11:22.919 --> 11:25.688
Okay, so, what would Rocket do?

11:25.689 --> 11:27.289
PETER: Something...

11:27.290 --> 11:28.891
Crazy!

11:31.695 --> 11:34.530
If his thing has a mouth,
it must also have a...

11:34.531 --> 11:36.465
You know, an exhaust port.

11:37.534 --> 11:39.201
Hey, I'm right.

You're also insane.

Hey, Droney, see if you
can patch up the ship, okay?

12:09.833 --> 12:11.400
<i>Yes, Captain Land-Lord, sir.</i>

12:11.401 --> 12:13.402

All right, let's check this out.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.408
No wonder we couldn't find the Cosmic Seed.

12:19.409 --> 12:21.910
Without the crystals,
the map is incomplete.

12:24.881 --> 12:28.417
I knew there was something
special about that CryptoCube.

12:28.418 --> 12:30.819
Where there's a map, there's treasure.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.889
And the Cosmic Seed is the
greatest collectible of all.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.457
(ALARM SOUNDS)

12:35.458 --> 12:37.326
What in blazes?

12:37.327 --> 12:40.929
It's alive. It's alive!

12:44.434 --> 12:45.601
Oblitobot!

12:45.602 --> 12:47.936
(LAUGHS) My perfect creation!

12:47.937 --> 12:50.939
Your master commands you to step forward.

12:52.876 --> 12:54.409
Yes...

12:54.410 --> 12:55.511
Yes!

12:57.447 --> 12:58.947
(ALARM CONTINUES)

13:02.452 --> 13:03.819
COLLECTOR: No!

13:06.890 --> 13:08.457
(GROWLS)

13:08.458 --> 13:09.525
Whoa, that's my boy.

13:10.293 --> 13:11.326
(CACKLES)

13:18.668 --> 13:21.436
Hey, wait up. Stop!

13:21.437 --> 13:23.071
Ah!

13:23.072 --> 13:25.307
Hey. Hey, what gives?

13:29.078 --> 13:31.313
My collection!

13:31.748 --> 13:32.915
(GROWLS)

13:37.587 --> 13:39.354
(MOANS)

13:39.355 --> 13:41.056
Pocket Dimension Storage Vial.

13:41.057 --> 13:43.091
Extremely useful for collecting.

13:43.092 --> 13:44.593
What's with the choke?

13:44.594 --> 13:46.361
Why can't I leave the lab?

13:46.362 --> 13:49.565
Clearly your habitat allowed
you too much freedom as it is.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.467
What do you mean, "habitat?"

13:52.468 --> 13:54.636
Haven't you figured it out?

13:54.637 --> 13:56.805
You're part of my collection.

13:56.806 --> 13:59.775
I found that maintaining
the illusion of freedom

13:59.776 --> 14:03.412
keeps some of my specimens more docile.

14:03.413 --> 14:05.981
(GROANING) That collar is
a neural control device,

14:05.982 --> 14:08.750
programmed to keep you in
the confines of your habitat.

14:08.751 --> 14:10.552
(CREATURES ROARING)

14:12.655 --> 14:14.089
Cheer up, Rocket.

14:14.090 --> 14:16.825
I don't just collect any old alien species.

14:16.826 --> 14:19.061
You have to be very special, indeed.

14:21.664 --> 14:23.498
In your case...

14:23.499 --> 14:24.867
One-of-a-kind.

14:25.768 --> 14:26.835
(SHUDDERS)

14:33.977 --> 14:36.445
GAMORA: I don't see a destination
on the map. I think we need more...

14:36.446 --> 14:38.013
I am Groot.

14:38.014 --> 14:39.848
What's the matter, you need
some fertilizer or something?

14:39.849 --> 14:41.483
I am Groot!

14:41.484 --> 14:42.818
You need a bud-vase?

14:42.819 --> 14:44.486
You're pollinating?

14:44.487 --> 14:45.888
You require a pruning?

14:45.889 --> 14:48.523
(GROANS)

14:51.160 --> 14:52.995
I am Groot.

14:52.996 --> 14:54.630
Rocket's in danger.

14:54.631 --> 14:56.665
<i>Repairs are complete,
Captain Land-Lord, sir.</i>

14:56.666 --> 14:58.033
<i>Will we be following the map?</i>

14:58.034 --> 15:00.802
Nope, we're going after Rocket.

15:00.803 --> 15:02.704
And you can call me Star-Lord.

15:05.475 --> 15:07.776
Follow the map or bring it to me.

15:07.777 --> 15:11.580
Either way, I will add the
Cosmic Seed to my collection.

15:14.517 --> 15:16.485
Think, fur-brain.

15:16.486 --> 15:19.655
How do you bust out of a
collar that keys on brainwaves?

15:19.656 --> 15:20.923
Oh...

15:20.924 --> 15:21.990
Duh!

15:31.200 --> 15:34.102
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

15:37.473 --> 15:40.475
Yo, Groot, can you find
Rocket with that wrist corsage?

15:46.015 --> 15:47.482
I am Groot.

15:53.489 --> 15:56.458
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

16:01.564 --> 16:03.565
Where's Rocket?

16:03.566 --> 16:06.601
<i>COLLECTOR: Safely filed
away in my collection.</i>

16:06.602 --> 16:08.036
But I'll consider a trade.

16:08.037 --> 16:11.006
The rodent for your Spartax CryptoCube.

16:14.711 --> 16:16.645
ROCKET: Hey, I got a trade for you!

16:18.581 --> 16:21.249
You let us go, and I'll
bust you in the chops.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.584
Sound fair?

16:22.585 --> 16:24.052
The neural collar.

16:24.053 --> 16:25.821
How...
- ROCKET: Neural amplifier.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.589
Boosted my own brainwaves

16:27.590 --> 16:29.658
and overloaded your stinkin' necklace.

16:30.059 --> 16:31.960
I am Groot.

16:31.961 --> 16:34.129
You said it, pal.

16:34.130 --> 16:37.532
Oh, and one more thing. The rest of
your little zoo is coming with us.

16:37.533 --> 16:38.734
You do not want to do that.

16:38.735 --> 16:40.135
Watch me!

16:41.938 --> 16:43.538
(ROARING)

16:46.709 --> 16:48.777
(GASPS) On second thought...

16:48.778 --> 16:50.645
(ROARS)

16:50.646 --> 16:52.647
I wondered what happened to him.

16:56.085 --> 16:57.152
Whoa!

16:59.088 --> 17:01.056
Fin Fang Foom.

17:01.057 --> 17:03.725
Last of the Makluan species.

17:03.726 --> 17:06.060
Fortunately, I added him to my collection

17:06.061 --> 17:09.131
shortly after your own
unfortunate encounter.

17:09.132 --> 17:10.732
He's truly one of a...

17:10.733 --> 17:12.300
ROCKET: Coming through!
(SCREAMS)

17:22.310 --> 17:28.150
(ROARS) Get away from my
friends, you flying barbeque pit.

17:31.254 --> 17:33.688
Oh, so you admit we're friends?

17:33.689 --> 17:37.759
Just keep dragon-breath
busy for me! I got an idea.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.161
Keep him busy how?

17:39.162 --> 17:41.797
Oh, I'm sure you'll think of something.

17:46.602 --> 17:47.702
How did you...

17:48.805 --> 17:50.806
Check your pockets, genius.

18:02.351 --> 18:04.653
Time to tame the dragon.

18:06.756 --> 18:07.889
But first...

18:14.664 --> 18:17.065
How do you like it, fin-face?

18:24.207 --> 18:25.607
PETER: Uh, is it just me,

18:25.608 --> 18:27.109
or is this thing kind of indestructible?

18:28.711 --> 18:29.878
So are we.

18:31.848 --> 18:33.882
So nice of you to join us.

18:33.883 --> 18:35.984
Look, we need you to...
- Zip it, Quill.

18:35.985 --> 18:37.652
This time, I'm the one making demands.

18:37.653 --> 18:39.154
Groot? You're with me.

18:39.155 --> 18:41.356
The rest of you distract lizard-boy.

18:41.357 --> 18:43.158

18:50.700 --> 18:53.168
No, no, no! Not in there!

19:11.954 --> 19:14.689
My Third Dynasty Krylorian Crystal!

19:14.690 --> 19:17.159
My A'Askavariian Moon Ritual Icons!

19:17.160 --> 19:19.761
My Gunavan Tentacle-Flosser!

19:19.762 --> 19:20.862
This is not happening!

19:20.863 --> 19:22.764
Give me a boost up to his neck.

19:23.733 --> 19:25.767

Uh, I propose a new trade.

19:41.083 --> 19:44.152
I promise to never
collect any of you again,

19:44.153 --> 19:47.155
and you leave and never, never come back.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.462
Who's docile now?

19:54.463 --> 19:56.765
What do you think? Should we trust the guy

19:56.766 --> 19:58.700
who sent us to get
swallowed by an asteroid?

19:58.701 --> 20:03.038
Even though we got the crystal anyway? Ha!

20:03.039 --> 20:05.840
I say we let him enjoy
his one-of-a-kind creature,

20:05.841 --> 20:07.876
from the inside.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.111
No, wait. You need more Pandorian crystals

20:10.112 --> 20:12.147
to unlock the CryptoCube's secrets.

20:12.148 --> 20:13.848
I can tell you where to find them.

20:13.849 --> 20:15.317
Deal.

20:15.318 --> 20:17.452
(STUTTERS) Not so fast.

20:17.453 --> 20:19.788
I wanna stick around a while.

20:19.789 --> 20:23.024
I never had so much fun breaking stuff.

20:23.025 --> 20:25.260
Please go, I will do anything.

20:25.261 --> 20:27.462
Anything?

20:28.798 --> 20:30.365
about where to find those crystals?

20:30.366 --> 20:32.067
ROCKET: Eh, you'll find out.

Soon as we get these creatures

20:33.502 --> 20:35.136
back to their proper homes.

20:35.137 --> 20:37.739
What about you? Going home too?

20:38.441 --> 20:39.507
Hmm.

20:43.279 --> 20:45.046
I am home.

20:45.047 --> 20:47.482
Excellent, I look forward to
more of your feeble attempts
