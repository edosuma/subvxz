01:09.695 --> 01:16.535
We knew that they would come for us.

01:18.996 --> 01:22.416
Like they always had before.

01:24.918 --> 01:29.673
We tried to warn the others
that they would come for them too.

01:31.133 --> 01:36.430
Because we knew how far they would go.

01:40.934 --> 01:45.480
Four years ago, I was fasting in the bush.

01:46.607 --> 01:54.656
I saw that a swarm of giant mosquitos
would be coming for us.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.621
I also saw that a person, a guardian,

02:00.746 --> 02:07.211
would come from the north to help us.

02:09.128 --> 02:16.595
We heard stories about
this place called Bigstone.

02:17.095 --> 02:22.559
We thought this person
could lead us there.

42:53.490 --> 42:55.242
This is Cree land.

43:17.514 --> 43:18.390
You're Cree?

43:24.188 --> 43:25.397
Do you speak Cree?

44:09.483 --> 44:11.026
Were you tracking her?

44:16.073 --> 44:17.574
I think she might beÂ okanaweyihcikew.

44:25.415 --> 44:28.460
Find out everything you can on her. Hurry.

44:30.796 --> 44:33.131
I need to talk to the
Elders and the leaders.

44:33.382 --> 44:34.091
Wait.

44:34.174 --> 44:35.008
No.

44:35.676 --> 44:36.510
No.

44:37.803 --> 44:39.721
Our search may be over.

45:04.204 --> 45:07.791
You were so busy playing around while
there was a battle going on,

45:07.833 --> 45:09.835
you didn't notice her coming.

45:16.383 --> 45:17.926
Just like your farts.

45:27.394 --> 45:28.937
Welcome Niska.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.235
Get her some food.

45:52.419 --> 45:54.796
I was woken up

45:55.172 --> 45:57.341
to come and meet this woman.

45:58.217 --> 45:59.051
Where is she?

45:59.968 --> 46:01.303
There she is.

46:01.345 --> 46:02.596
From Kiskachewanohk.

46:04.139 --> 46:05.057
Niska come.

46:23.575 --> 46:27.371
I am glad to meet you.

46:36.505 --> 46:44.721
Long ago, we were told that someone
would be arriving from the north.

46:45.097 --> 46:49.726
We have been waiting
for you for a long time.

46:50.519 --> 46:54.147
You are the guardian.

47:03.365 --> 47:05.951
And now we will dance.

47:06.618 --> 47:14.751
Two more children have been brought back
along with one of our own. Welcome.

51:03.105 --> 51:06.149
You are welcome here
in Kitsaki, Niska.

51:06.775 --> 51:09.862
Come. Get some rest.

52:23.519 --> 52:25.437
Welcome Niska.

52:31.485 --> 52:33.946
Waseese is in an evil place.

52:40.285 --> 52:44.665
The kids are trained to become
Jingo puppets.

52:45.249 --> 52:47.960
They are subjected to unspeakable things.

52:53.882 --> 52:56.134
Wouldn't you rather talk to Waseese?

52:56.760 --> 53:00.472
We can get her from the Academy.

53:05.352 --> 53:08.605
But there is one thing
we ask of you in return.

53:09.898 --> 53:14.069
We need you to take the children
to a safe zone up north.

53:20.117 --> 53:21.326
No, it's real.

53:21.827 --> 53:24.663
And we need someone
to take the children there.

54:31.647 --> 54:35.526
We look at these rocks as
life forms, similar to the trees.

54:35.567 --> 54:38.654
This reflects how we see and think.

54:41.031 --> 54:42.824
This is a balsam tree.

54:45.244 --> 54:47.037
We use them in many different ways.

55:21.363 --> 55:22.489
What are you doing here?

55:36.837 --> 55:38.797
You better go convince her then.

1:15:27.110 --> 1:15:28.195
Come in.

1:15:33.408 --> 1:15:38.580
All of our relations are meeting here.

1:15:39.039 --> 1:15:44.211
We need to do this in a good way
and think in a good way.

1:15:45.128 --> 1:15:47.172
Thank you grandmother.

1:15:47.881 --> 1:15:53.512
We must evacuate the camp
children by tonight.

1:15:58.392 --> 1:16:00.853
The Jingoes have built a new mining road

1:16:00.894 --> 1:16:03.981
overnight that is heading
straight for our camp.

1:16:04.356 --> 1:16:13.323
We're concerned that we've run
out of time for the raid.

1:16:17.703 --> 1:16:21.331
We want to help but they've advanced much
faster than what we thought.

1:16:30.799 --> 1:16:38.265
Long ago, our grandfathers were here.
They all lived here.

1:16:39.016 --> 1:16:47.316
But then this government
forced us to leave.

1:16:48.275 --> 1:16:55.240
They even tried to kill us.

1:16:55.782 --> 1:16:58.702
They even tried to kill us.

1:16:58.827 --> 1:17:00.162
But they could not do it.

1:17:00.954 --> 1:17:05.083
We are still here.

1:17:08.170 --> 1:17:12.174
The goose is never alone on a journey.

1:17:12.424 --> 1:17:20.098
In order to succeed,
she always travels with a partner.

1:17:20.474 --> 1:17:23.393
This is what we also have to do as people.

1:17:25.062 --> 1:17:27.189
Thank you grandmother.

1:17:33.987 --> 1:17:37.241
Niska, do we agree or not?

1:17:42.454 --> 1:17:45.916
Somonis, prepare the
camp. Leo and Charlie,

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:49.086
you'll raid tonight for the last time.

1:26:51.128 --> 1:26:53.839
Run!

1:26:58.677 --> 1:27:00.220
Any sign of them?

1:27:02.931 --> 1:27:04.600
How many?

1:27:05.017 --> 1:27:05.851
Twenty...

1:27:16.403 --> 1:27:18.197
I'll get the kids out.

1:27:18.488 --> 1:27:20.032
You lead the line.

1:27:22.534 --> 1:27:23.368
No.

1:27:23.535 --> 1:27:26.788
The kids need protection.

1:27:27.581 --> 1:27:29.249
You can do this.

1:27:35.923 --> 1:27:40.969
Nothing makes me more proud
than to stand with you all.

1:27:42.221 --> 1:27:47.226
If we take our last breaths fighting
against our colonizers,

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:51.772
then it will be a good way to die.

1:27:57.069 --> 1:27:59.112
Somonis will lead the line.

1:28:46.785 --> 1:28:49.288
Give me enough time to get them out.

1:34:48.772 --> 1:34:54.319
It was her mother that brought her to us.

1:34:55.445 --> 1:34:58.198
All the way down from the north.

1:34:59.324 --> 1:35:06.331
She came back to her people
to protect us on that day.

1:35:09.251 --> 1:35:13.255
We call her the guardian.
