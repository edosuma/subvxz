We spoke earlier on the phone.
- Yeah, sure.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.135
- Look, I know you're still
on the fence about the job

12:25.179 --> 12:27.355
so I figured I'd swing by,

12:27.398 --> 12:30.967
see if I could set the hook.

12:31.011 --> 12:34.318
That is a '51 Chris-Craft
Special Runabout.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.624
One owner.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.278
Been under a dusty tarp
for decades.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.280
- Came up at auction.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.803
Said to my girlfriend,

12:40.847 --> 12:42.326
"Put the trip to New Zealand
on ice, babe.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.024
We are buying a boat."

12:44.067 --> 12:46.156
- Well, you got a nice one.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.592
They stopped making these
in '52.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.985
- Mm-hmm.
My son--

12:49.029 --> 12:50.204
I have a ten-year-old--

12:50.247 --> 12:51.553
he flipped out.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.337
He loves anything
to do with water.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.338
Jet-skis, fishing.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.079
Anyway,

12:56.123 --> 12:58.995
I'm hoping we can have this
sea-worthy by summer.

12:59.039 --> 12:59.996
- I'd want to take
a closer look at it,

13:00.040 --> 13:00.997
but yeah, I don't see why not.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.477
- Yeah.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.392
Well, Greg Rogers
at Marina Outfitters...

13:04.435 --> 13:06.220
I said, "Give me
your best recommendation"

13:06.263 --> 13:09.179
for a restorer--he wrote down
your name, two seconds flat.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.441
- Yeah, Greg's a good guy.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.183
And this is...

13:13.227 --> 13:14.532
it's beautiful.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.534
- It's a big job, I know.

13:16.578 --> 13:19.407
And I, uh--I realize it'll
take up a lot of your time.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.626
But you seem like
the kind of guy

13:21.670 --> 13:24.281
that'll take your time
and do it right.

13:24.325 --> 13:27.110
And, uh...

13:27.154 --> 13:29.199
I'm in.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.114
- Great.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.203
Great, man.
Let me, uh...

13:33.247 --> 13:34.683
Let me give you the address.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.380
- Okay, hey.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.469
Who didn't put in yet?

13:40.123 --> 13:42.691
- Oh, uh...

13:42.734 --> 13:46.477
our captain had a bit
of a tragedy last night, so...

13:46.521 --> 13:47.696
we're pitching in.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.263
- Hey, hold up.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.923
- Wow.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.708
That, uh...

13:59.751 --> 14:02.145
that's mighty nice of you.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.190
- Glad I could help.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.234
Kelly.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.019
See you later?

14:06.062 --> 14:07.020
- Yeah.
- Come by any time.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.935
- All right, pleasure.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.245
- A little razzle dazzle,

14:15.289 --> 14:17.073
some rah-rah energy,

14:17.117 --> 14:20.424
the entire senior class
is gonna give us a standing O.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.644
Yeah, that's not
how high school works.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.473
- You can't do a cheer, Brett.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.910
They will either laugh
right in your face

14:27.954 --> 14:29.651
or they will post
your failure on Twitter

14:29.694 --> 14:30.652
and then good luck
living that down

14:30.695 --> 14:32.175
for the next millennium.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.394
- That's what
I've been telling her.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.091
Let's just set up
the training door

14:35.135 --> 14:36.963
and, Cruz, you can Slamigan
the hell out of it,

14:37.006 --> 14:39.617
and, Otis, you can work
the robot gadget.

14:39.661 --> 14:40.618
- Kyojo.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.185
- Uh-huh.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.534
And then we turn on
the ambo's lights,

14:43.578 --> 14:45.014
we blare the horn
a couple times,

14:45.058 --> 14:46.015
boom, boom,
thank you for coming,

14:46.059 --> 14:47.147
and we're out of there.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.931
- They're 17,
they're not seven.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.194
- You just need to know how
to speak their language

14:51.238 --> 14:52.717
with the memes and the texting.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.198
See, my kids, they're always
saying things like

14:55.242 --> 14:58.636
"B-T dubs" and "Lim-fow."

15:00.073 --> 15:02.162
- Yeah, "laughing my face off."

15:02.205 --> 15:04.164
- Yeah, that's not what
that means.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.124
- Food is what
they'll respond to.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.735
- It's true.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.476
- Okay.

15:15.131 --> 15:18.482
♪ We are the CFD,
so get on your feet ♪

15:18.526 --> 15:22.747
♪ Rise up, 'cause fire safety
can't be beat! ♪

15:22.791 --> 15:24.619
- No, Brett.
Just no.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.143
- Looking for
Chief Boden's office.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.797
- Oh, uh...

15:28.840 --> 15:31.800
it's just, uh, down the hall.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.454
- Thanks.

15:37.719 --> 15:40.722
- Here he comes now.
Come on in, Detective.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.160
- Just keeping you in the loop
as promised.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.162
Fire Investigation's
still working the scene.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.164
So far they've found
a melted gas can

15:48.208 --> 15:49.513
in the living room,

15:49.557 --> 15:51.080
but can't pull prints off it
due to charring.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.299
Security cameras caught someone

15:52.342 --> 15:53.604
approaching the back
of the building

15:53.648 --> 15:56.520
about 2:20 am, ten minutes
before the fire.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.174
He was wearing a backpack.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.220
- Yeah.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.700
But he also wore a hoodie
that obscured his face.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.181
Still looking for eyewitnesses
who might've seen the guy.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.183
- Seems like you're going
about this backwards.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.229
Shouldn't you just question
Gordon Mayfield?

16:09.272 --> 16:11.405
- I did.
He's got a firm alibi.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.797
His sister and brother too.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.538
- Nobody's suggesting
one of the Mayfields

16:14.582 --> 16:16.714
put on a hoodie
and set the fire.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.151
They hired somebody.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.761
- Okay, but Gordon Mayfield
strikes me

16:19.804 --> 16:21.589
as a pretty smart guy,

16:21.632 --> 16:22.590
which makes me ask myself,

16:22.633 --> 16:23.591
"Why would a guy that smart

16:23.634 --> 16:25.549
carry out a plan that dumb?"

16:25.593 --> 16:26.637
There are better ways
to kill people.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.335
- He didn't just want us dead.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.379
He was trying to destroy
the evidence we collected.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.598
- And let's not forget,

16:30.641 --> 16:32.208
for a dumb plan,
it nearly worked.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.515
These two barely got out alive.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.388
- Hey, you may be right.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.216
But Mayfield didn't crack
under questioning

16:40.260 --> 16:41.609
and now he's lawyered up.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.219
I can't go at him any harder

16:43.263 --> 16:45.134
until I exhaust
all other leads.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.399
- You make occasional enemies

16:49.443 --> 16:51.097
in your line of work,
don't you?

16:51.140 --> 16:53.403
Weren't you even in politics
for a while?

16:53.447 --> 16:54.839
- That has nothing
to do with this.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.190
- And I understand
you wrote a big exposé

16:57.233 --> 16:59.888
about a kingpin
in the Sinaloa cartel?

16:59.931 --> 17:01.498
- Four years ago.

17:01.542 --> 17:04.501
- Still, I have to exhaust
all possible scenarios.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.245
We know who's behind this.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.507
- Casey, take it easy.

17:10.551 --> 17:13.684
We almost died.

17:13.728 --> 17:17.645
Everything I own,
my whole life, is ash.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.560
And this guy's too scared
of Mayfield's lawyers

17:19.603 --> 17:21.910
to do anything about it.

17:30.658 --> 17:30.832
.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.964
- What about
that voicemail I got?

17:33.008 --> 17:34.009
That was either a warning
or a threat.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.184
- It was an anonymous call

17:35.228 --> 17:36.751
that came
from a blocked number.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.100
Unless you can tell me
who left it--

17:38.144 --> 17:39.884
- It was someone who had
inside information

17:39.928 --> 17:41.756
about Grandbrook,
probably an employee.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.888
- Look, I get your frustration.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.716
I'm trying to get
to the bottom of this

17:45.760 --> 17:48.980
but you gotta let me
do it my way.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.550
I'll be in touch.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.167
- Oh.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.604
There you are,
you poor thing.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.084
- Cindy.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.215
Let me give you a hand.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.132
Psst.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.047
- Oh, hey, honey.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.788
Hey.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.485
Thanks, honey.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.794
- It's for you.

18:19.837 --> 18:20.795
- Cindy...

18:20.838 --> 18:22.144
- It's just the basics.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.668
There's some clothes.
Toothbrush.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.454
Razor.
- This must've cost a fortune.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.064
- Yeah, don't worry about that.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.587
Some rich buddy of Severide's

18:30.631 --> 18:33.503
dropped a fistful of C-notes
in the boot, so.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.810
- What, are you
passing the boot?

18:35.853 --> 18:36.985
You didn't have to do that.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.160
- Ah, come on, Casey.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.510
Of course we're gonna do that.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.905
- Well, I--I don't know
what to say.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.168
You...

18:46.212 --> 18:48.562
You guys are the best.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.913
Come here.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.133
- We got your back, brother.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.960
So, uh,

18:56.004 --> 18:58.180
what'd that Sergeant Friday
have to say?

18:58.224 --> 19:01.183
He make an arrest yet?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.535
♪

19:05.579 --> 19:09.539
Guess you just gotta
be patient.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.541
- No.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.631
I don't.

19:14.675 --> 19:18.069
♪

19:18.113 --> 19:21.986
I wanna go talk
to the Mayfields myself.

19:22.030 --> 19:25.512
I wanna see them try to deny
their involvement to my face.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.166
- They won't talk
to us again, Matt.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.169
They're pulling up
the drawbridge.

19:32.910 --> 19:36.697
We can let Hollander do things
his way, but...

19:36.740 --> 19:40.614
I have my own way
of getting information.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.181
- You need to look
at the fire

19:42.224 --> 19:44.574
that happened last week
outside Indianapolis

19:44.618 --> 19:46.750
at the Dunlap trailer village.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.143
You have no idea
what you've done

19:48.187 --> 19:49.710
with that article of yours.

19:49.753 --> 19:53.279
You better start
watching your back.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.716
- Okay.
Here we go.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.153
The Grandbrook company
directory.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.590
Every employee's
contact information.

20:02.940 --> 20:06.814
- This is what I do.

20:06.857 --> 20:10.252
There's almost 1,100
phone numbers listed here.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.298
- We better go print it up.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.127
- What if we show them
online videos

20:16.171 --> 20:17.607
where people get hurt

20:17.651 --> 20:19.130
and describe how we would
set up a rescue?

20:19.174 --> 20:20.610
I saw this one yesterday

20:20.654 --> 20:22.133
where this helicopter
was dangling off

20:22.177 --> 20:23.918
the side of a building.

20:23.961 --> 20:24.919
I was like, "Whoa."

20:24.962 --> 20:26.094
- That was us.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.575
- Yeah, big time.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.273
- I couldn't help overhearing
about your presentation.

20:31.317 --> 20:34.058
You should consider
doing some cheers.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.060
That would be amazing.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.195
- Ain't happening, partner.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.154
- She told you to say that,
didn't she?

20:43.198 --> 20:44.286
- I'm telling you,

20:44.330 --> 20:46.723
food is the key.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.768
Taco Tuesday.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.248
It's a thing everyone loves.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.293
- I don't think our hearts
are into this right now.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.816
- Agreed.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.122
Let's pick this up
at Molly's later.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.732
All of my best ideas come

20:55.776 --> 20:57.125
between two and three drinks.

20:57.168 --> 21:00.346
- Wait, wait.
I have it.

21:00.389 --> 21:03.044
We build an obstacle course,

21:03.087 --> 21:05.089
"American Ninja Warrior" style,

21:05.133 --> 21:07.309
except we have stretcher races
and a rope climb

21:07.353 --> 21:10.181
and things we actually do
to train.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.835
- We could use the ladders
on the ground

21:11.879 --> 21:13.228
as, like, a high-knees section.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.969
- Yeah.
- And a dummy drag.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.840
- Put 'em in turn out coats
to really wear them out.

21:16.884 --> 21:17.972
- Uh-huh.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.714
- There's something here.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.325
- A class action lawsuit.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.896
- She took off
a little while ago.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.117
- Hell yeah we are.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.865
- Hey, Stella.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.954
You know what I found
in the back of my drawer?

- It's just stuff, Matt.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.027
- There's more to it.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.247
It's not just stuff.

36:02.290 --> 36:07.643
It's time and memories and...

36:10.472 --> 36:14.302
I spent the last
four years here.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.565
A lot happened
inside these walls.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.614
- I'm sorry I brought
all this dirty business

36:21.657 --> 36:24.007
to your doorstep.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.271
- Don't be.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.534
We did a good thing here.

36:28.577 --> 36:31.189
- We did.

36:36.411 --> 36:40.198
- You're leaving.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.590
Where to?

36:41.634 --> 36:43.331
- Zurich.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.507
For an assignment.

36:45.551 --> 36:47.683
It came up fast.
These things usually do.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.207
- Yeah.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.731
Great, that's...
that's great.

36:51.774 --> 36:54.212
- It is.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.170
What's not so great is

36:56.214 --> 37:00.174
cutting our time together
short.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.524
I wish there'd been more of it.

37:02.568 --> 37:05.397
- Same here.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.576
- For what it's worth,

37:10.619 --> 37:13.274
I think you should
take this stuff,

37:13.318 --> 37:14.754
put it somewhere safe,

37:14.797 --> 37:18.714
and then...
forget about it.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.804
Now's the time

37:21.848 --> 37:24.285
to make new memories.

37:24.329 --> 37:27.680
Have fun.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.509
- Yeah.

37:30.552 --> 37:34.034
You're a fun person,
Matt Casey.

37:34.077 --> 37:36.079
- So are you.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.769
- You were right about Tyler.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.734
Yeah, apparently I'm the idiot.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.301
- You're not an idiot.

38:23.344 --> 38:26.260
- Here's the thing, Kelly.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.176
It doesn't matter.

38:29.219 --> 38:30.917
It was never about Tyler.

38:35.138 --> 38:38.359
You've been pushing me away
ever since your dad died.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.492
And I've done everything I can

38:40.535 --> 38:42.537
to be there for you,

38:42.581 --> 38:45.148
to try and make this work.

38:45.192 --> 38:47.107
And, uh...

38:47.150 --> 38:49.544
it hasn't changed anything.

38:49.588 --> 38:52.417
Your jealousy...

38:52.460 --> 38:54.897
The way you keep
shutting me out.

38:59.598 --> 39:03.123
You're going down
some dark hole

39:03.166 --> 39:04.603
and I know
what that looks like,

39:04.646 --> 39:10.130
because I've been there before
with Grant.

39:10.173 --> 39:13.829
And maybe you want me
to keep showing up...

39:13.873 --> 39:17.659
to somehow pull you
out of this,

39:17.703 --> 39:21.315
but I have been the lifeline
for a drowning man,

39:21.359 --> 39:23.491
and I will never do that again.

39:29.976 --> 39:33.196
I love you.

39:37.462 --> 39:41.422
But I can't be with you
anymore.
