WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:01.469
Last time on
Make It Pop.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.636
(scream)

00:02.670 --> 00:06.074
The air conditioning
system has malfunctioned

00:06.107 --> 00:07.241
and sprung
a leak.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.509
Who is
responsible for this?

00:08.542 --> 00:11.112
I don't think I've ever
seen you and masked girl

00:11.145 --> 00:13.147
in the same place
at the same time.

00:13.181 --> 00:13.914
I'm Masked Girl.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.217
* Ever, ever, ever, ever

00:16.250 --> 00:17.585
It was you!?

00:17.618 --> 00:19.187
You're Masked Girl!

00:19.220 --> 00:20.788
And you lied
to me about it?

00:20.821 --> 00:22.190
I wanted to tell you--

00:22.223 --> 00:23.824
--but you didn't.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.592
Jared.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.628
I don't want
to hear it, Corki.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.464
You know, I don't know what
could hurt more than this.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.666
Except maybe this hangnail
that's been keeping me up

00:32.700 --> 00:35.436
at night. but,
that's a whole other story.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.476
Drama.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.145
And not the
kind I teach.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.680
This is the all clear.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.816
I repeat, all clear.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.153
Students, please return
to your original rooms.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.487
Social order
has been restored!

00:53.521 --> 00:56.257
Okay everyone, the sooner
you get back to your rooms

00:56.290 --> 00:58.659
the sooner I can have a
hot bath and contemplate

00:58.692 --> 01:00.428
my life choices!

01:00.461 --> 01:01.262
Okay, let's go.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.436
Nice going, newbie.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.505
Jared is so
done with you.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.706
Oh yeah?

01:12.740 --> 01:15.209
We'll see who he likes better
when my girl locks a spot

01:15.243 --> 01:16.477
on Homecoming Court.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.178
What?

01:17.211 --> 01:18.412
That's right!

01:18.446 --> 01:21.415
Kiss the crown goodbye, because
Corki is going all the way.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.316
Right, Corki?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.385
Um.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.188
She's still getting the hang of
the whole witty-comeback-thing.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.329
Sharpen your pencil, Corki.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.498
Because you're
about to get schooled.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.401
Yeah, well, maybe
I enjoy getting schooled

01:40.434 --> 01:43.471
Because I value a
good education.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.409
It was a good effort.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.110
She'll work on it.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.222
You really think
this will work?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.055
It has to.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.358
If we let Valerie
tell us what to do,

02:04.392 --> 02:07.295
we'll spend high school
in almost cool limbo.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.530
And I am not
almost anything.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.631
Hear that, girls?

02:10.664 --> 02:13.301
It's the sound of a someone
not making an impression

02:13.334 --> 02:15.169
on student voters.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.670
You're out of
your league, Corki.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.273
No freshman has
ever beaten a senior

02:19.307 --> 02:21.342
and you're not
going to be the first!

02:24.445 --> 02:27.415
* Make it pop! Woo, Woo

02:27.448 --> 02:31.285
* Make it pop! Woo, Woo

02:31.319 --> 02:32.686
* I can't wait, no

02:32.720 --> 02:34.288
* I can't wait, no

02:34.322 --> 02:37.491
* I can't wait no,
I can't wait no, I can't wait *

02:37.525 --> 02:38.892
* So, make it pop!

02:38.926 --> 02:41.295
* We're bout to,
we're bout to blow! *

02:41.329 --> 02:42.696
* Wait till we drop!

02:42.730 --> 02:44.698
* Oh yeah,
we're ready to go *

02:44.732 --> 02:47.701
* Ain't gonna stop, when
is it time for the show? *

02:47.735 --> 02:50.504
* We make it, you make it,
we make it *

02:50.538 --> 02:53.807
* M-m-m-m-m-
make it pop! *

02:54.842 --> 02:56.777
Corki: Why is
Valerie like that?

02:56.810 --> 02:59.413
Deep-seeded
insecurities stemming

02:59.447 --> 03:00.748
from a
perfect childhood.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.250
That makes no sense.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.851
It makes total sense.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.753
All perfect people
are hiding something!

03:05.786 --> 03:07.588
I thought you said
you were perfect.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.357
I'm the
exception to the rule.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.458
Don't worry
about Valerie.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.594
She's just jealous because
you might actually win.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.830
But it was Masked Girl
who was popular, not me.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.233
We're not
giving up, Corki.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.902
We just need a
brilliant campaign,

03:21.935 --> 03:24.838
which means we need a
brilliant campaign manager,

03:24.872 --> 03:27.275
which means
we need me.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.310
You guys really
think I stand a chance?

03:29.343 --> 03:30.611
Of course you do.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.414
You just need a total,
irrational belief

03:33.447 --> 03:35.549
that everything you
do is awesome,

03:35.583 --> 03:37.651
no matter the reality
of the situation.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.786
That's called
being delusional.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.456
Nooooo, it's called
being a dreamer.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.358
Or a web celeb.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.359
Or delusional.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.529
A little higher
on the left.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.665
Right.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.500
Heather!

03:52.533 --> 03:53.567
No!

03:53.601 --> 03:56.870
When I said "right"
I mean the left is correct.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.838
This is my left.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.674
I know because it has my
left bracelet on it.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.378
Right!

04:04.412 --> 04:07.981
I remember my
homecoming days,

04:08.015 --> 04:12.686
when we would re-unite,
partake in gluttonous endeavors,

04:12.720 --> 04:16.690
frolic in
the fall leaves.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.959
No one's
listening to me.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.329
Lovely job on
the banner, Heather.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.597
Keep it up.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.666
Mr. Stark, that's what
the rope is for.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.574
Let's give this
a test run.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.075
Ouuu!

04:35.108 --> 04:37.578
Thank you, thank you,
you're too kind.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.382
Of course I'll autograph
that for you, Heather.

04:42.550 --> 04:46.053
Um, Valerie, that's
permanent marker.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.388
Lucky you!

04:47.421 --> 04:48.055
(gasping)

04:48.088 --> 04:49.022
I love it!

04:51.525 --> 04:53.361
Mr. Stark: This is
a disaster!

04:54.795 --> 04:56.697
I just received a
last minute cancellation

04:56.730 --> 04:58.566
from the Homecoming DJ.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.068
I think we have different
definitions of disaster

05:01.101 --> 05:04.438
Mr. Stark,
earthquakes, monsoons,

05:04.472 --> 05:05.706
dates that
dine and dash,

05:05.739 --> 05:06.039
What?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.508
What?

05:07.541 --> 05:10.411
Those are disasters.

05:10.444 --> 05:14.114
But without music, how will they
be overtaken by the rhythm.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.417
They'll just dance like--

05:16.450 --> 05:18.519
Eeeehhhh, eeeeh!

05:23.457 --> 05:24.257
--that.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.127
Please don't do
that in my office.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.029
Just find another DJ.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.097
But--

05:30.130 --> 05:31.665
You can go now.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.873
This paint job
is ugh,

05:39.907 --> 05:42.476
It's really
something.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.988
Man, where did
Mr. Stark go?

05:57.858 --> 05:58.926
Hey Caleb!

05:58.959 --> 06:00.160
Oh hey, Jodi.

06:00.193 --> 06:00.894
How's it goin'?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.730
Hey, have you
seen Mr. Stark?

06:02.763 --> 06:03.531
No.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.073
So, listen...

06:13.106 --> 06:16.577
I've been thinking and the
homecoming dance is soon,

06:16.610 --> 06:19.413
so, since I'm going
and you're going--

06:19.447 --> 06:21.815
Hey, you know what, this is
great small talk but,

06:21.849 --> 06:23.050
I really gotta go!

06:26.119 --> 06:27.955
Corki,
for homecoming!

06:27.988 --> 06:29.723
This is what it
takes to win.

06:29.757 --> 06:33.927
Posters, buttons an online
campaign at warp speed.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.664
I'm averaging 75 new
fans an hour.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.933
And people laughed at my
daily finger excersises.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.870
If we play this right, you
could be crowned a queen,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.472
in a Jodi Mapa design.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.873
You really think so?

06:49.242 --> 06:53.814
* We're gonna take
down the whole system *

06:53.847 --> 06:55.983
* Right now we're
on a mission *

06:56.016 --> 06:58.819
* There's never a
better time to be doing it *

06:58.852 --> 07:04.157
* Time for a change, let's
make a change here tonight *

07:04.191 --> 07:07.728
* We're losing our minds,
We're losing our patience *

07:07.761 --> 07:11.231
* We're using up every
bit of passion we have *

07:11.264 --> 07:18.772
* On everything else except for
love (except for love) *

07:18.806 --> 07:20.708
* We're all out of time

07:20.741 --> 07:22.943
* We're tired of chasing

07:22.976 --> 07:26.113
* Chasing what
they want us to be *

07:26.146 --> 07:33.621
* But we've had
enough, oh enough *

07:33.654 --> 07:38.058
* We're gonna take
down the whole system *

07:38.091 --> 07:40.160
* Right now we're
on a mission *

07:40.193 --> 07:42.963
* There's never a
better time to be doing it *

07:42.996 --> 07:49.102
* Time for a change, let's
make a change here tonight *

07:49.136 --> 07:52.973
* Na na na na
na na na na na na na *

07:53.006 --> 07:56.710
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

07:56.744 --> 08:00.147
* Na na na na na
na na na na na na *

08:00.180 --> 08:03.116
* Hey, hey, hey,

08:03.150 --> 08:07.154
* So get up and stand,
stand up for something *

08:07.187 --> 08:10.591
* Something that we all can
believe (Can believe) *

08:10.624 --> 08:17.931
* But who can we trust
except for us oohh *

08:17.965 --> 08:22.536
* We're gonna take
down the whole system *

08:22.570 --> 08:24.738
* Right now we're
on a mission *

08:24.772 --> 08:27.174
* Never a better
time to be doing this *

08:27.207 --> 08:30.711
* It's time for a change, let's
make a change here tonight *

08:32.680 --> 08:39.219
* We're gonna raise our flag
so high can't take it down *

08:39.252 --> 08:40.487
* Wo oh oh

08:40.520 --> 08:49.229
* It's our time yeah were gonna
rule this town Oh oha whoa *

08:49.262 --> 08:53.767
* We're gonna take down the
whole system (take down) *

08:53.801 --> 08:55.769
* Right now we're
on a mission *

08:55.803 --> 08:58.606
* There's never a
better time to be doing it *

08:58.639 --> 09:01.875
* Time for a change, let's
make a change here tonight *

09:01.909 --> 09:03.644
(cheering)

09:04.878 --> 09:06.880
Let's do this!

09:06.914 --> 09:07.815
Button?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.617
Corki for Homecoming,
get a free button!

09:13.053 --> 09:14.221
I'm so sorry.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.355
It's okay.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.928
I mean it.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.796
I am sorry.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.632
I never meant to
lie to you,

09:24.665 --> 09:27.768
I just couldn't let anyone
know it was me behind that mask.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.770
Why?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.339
I can't say.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.142
It's kind of like how I never
tell anyone about the

09:35.175 --> 09:38.245
black-and-white artsy photos of
flowers I take on weekends.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.080
You do?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.381
Let's change the subject.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.384
Too much information.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.319
Would you
wear my button?

09:46.353 --> 09:47.921
Sure.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.991
So apology accepted?

09:51.024 --> 09:54.294
I'm a bigger man
than most, so yes.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.629
Nobody's perfect.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.830
Even Masked Girl?

10:05.238 --> 10:07.307
Now you'll be
looking at me all day.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.842
Especially my chin region.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.911
(laughing)

10:19.219 --> 10:21.955
Mr. Stark, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.124
I heard your
DJ bailed on you.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.092
Hmm.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.860
No, Come on, I've got
tons of experience.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.261
Two years
as a house DJ.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.262
Impressive, where?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.298
My family's basement,
I went on every night

10:31.331 --> 10:32.700
and my Nana loved it.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.335
Well, DJ'ing a MacKendrick
Prep homecoming

10:35.368 --> 10:37.404
is a different beast
entirely, Mr. Davis.

10:37.437 --> 10:41.008
It's about striking a balance
between old and new music,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.777
Mmm, catering to all
tastes and styles--

10:43.811 --> 10:45.378
I'll play at least
10% show tunes.

10:45.412 --> 10:45.913
Twenty.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.848
Fifteen.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.250
Welcome to the prestigious
world of a high school DJ.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.151
Yes!

10:51.184 --> 10:53.987
Ahem!

10:54.021 --> 10:55.022
Stop that.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.423
Stop that, don't.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.058
Hmph!

10:58.091 --> 11:03.063
My campaign is working--
people are talking about you.

11:03.096 --> 11:07.000
That doesn't look like the
friendly kind of talk we want.

11:07.034 --> 11:07.935
They're nervous.

11:07.968 --> 11:11.271
Probably too awestruck
to meet you in person.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.773
Hey, newbie.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.374
Nice try with
the campaign.

11:14.407 --> 11:19.146
That Masked-Girl-thing was cute,
but it's so two-days-ago.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.914
Better luck when
you're a senior.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.722
Sun Hi!

11:28.756 --> 11:31.224
We have to
get those down!

11:31.258 --> 11:32.392
Don't worry.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.928
No way that many
people have seen them yet.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.830
(schoolbell rings)

11:38.431 --> 11:42.269
(crowd murmuring)

11:51.011 --> 11:53.346
Well this looks like an
inordinately large amount

11:53.380 --> 11:54.547
of equipment.

11:54.581 --> 11:58.151
I'm going to make this the
best Homecoming ever, Mr. Stark.

11:58.185 --> 12:01.288
I just need access to
the main power system

12:01.321 --> 12:04.892
so I can connect my subwoofers
to the tactile transducers.

12:04.925 --> 12:11.331
Caleb. I'm hearing a lot of
this: "Untz Untz Untz"

12:11.364 --> 12:17.537
But I what I wanna be hearing
is: 5-6-7-8, ta-ta, ta-ta,

12:17.570 --> 12:20.507
annnnnnddd jazz hands!

12:20.540 --> 12:23.510
You're not familiar with the
"Caleb Sound Effect Theory"

12:23.543 --> 12:26.246
where more is
better, are you?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.480
No.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.151
You will be, then you'll know
I'm the man to do music for

12:31.184 --> 12:33.453
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.890
One thing at a time,
Mr. Davis.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.092
One thing at a time.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.931
Caleb, I'm going to
the dance this Friday,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.132
and I'm going with you.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.399
Got it?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.368
Wow, that felt good.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.170
Jodi, I don't know
what to say.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.972
If you know
what's good for you,

12:52.005 --> 12:54.174
you'll say that you've never
felt more excited about

12:54.207 --> 12:56.143
anything in your life.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.145
I'd like to say that--

12:58.178 --> 13:01.514
But I can't be your
date, I'm DJ-ing it.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.582
You got the gig?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.017
Pretty cool, right?

13:04.051 --> 13:05.085
Yeah.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.453
That's great, Caleb.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.155
Thanks.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.191
So technically we'll be
at the dance together--

13:11.224 --> 13:12.292
Just not--

13:12.325 --> 13:13.493
together.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.101
Hey, let me know if you have
any song requests, okay?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.103
Sure, will do!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.242
If that was
any indication,

13:29.276 --> 13:31.311
it would have been
fun dancing with you.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.252
This Homecoming election

13:39.286 --> 13:42.022
shouldn't be about cheap
mudslinging tactics.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.858
It should be about
character and ethics.

13:44.892 --> 13:47.560
That's why, moving forward,
I will continue to conduct

13:47.594 --> 13:51.031
my campaign with
integrity and positivity.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.134
Because it's the right way,
it's the honorable way,

13:54.167 --> 13:56.136
it's the
MacKendrick Prep way.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.304
Thank you.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.307
(crickets)

14:00.340 --> 14:01.108
(cellphone beeps)

14:04.211 --> 14:06.579
I see you're using the
personal touch and reaching out

14:06.613 --> 14:09.016
to the voters
one at a time.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.289
Um Val,
there's a door there.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.459
Look on
the bright side.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.062
No one saw her make
fun of you this time.

14:22.095 --> 14:22.963
I'm quitting.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.097
You can't quit!

14:24.131 --> 14:26.199
Someone needs to show Valerie
and her peppy goon squad

14:26.233 --> 14:28.035
that how they
behave isn't cool.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.037
I don't want to prove
anything to Valerie.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.039
I just want to
be a nice person.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.440
Didn't you listen
to my speech?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.142
Of course I did.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.376
It was about
Homecoming, right?

14:36.409 --> 14:39.546
Look, I know you mean well, but
every time you try to help,

14:39.579 --> 14:41.949
the Spirit Squad
just get weirder.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.150
I know, right?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.085
We're a good team.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.355
Ugh!

14:49.189 --> 14:51.358
If Caleb won't go to
the dance with me,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.193
at least my
dress can be there.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.296
Maybe, I should
take you.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.232
A couple of dummies
on the dance floor.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.301
Why did I ask
Caleb to the dance?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.238
What are you doing?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.407
Definitely not
hugging this dummy.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.209
Hey, check this out.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.378
This dress is
gonna be sick!

15:11.411 --> 15:14.181
It's my statement that I don't
care about going to Homecoming.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.282
I'm not going either.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.416
What?!

15:16.449 --> 15:20.587
That means my statement
about not going won't be going!

15:20.620 --> 15:21.654
Arghhh.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.524
Move over.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.692
Arghh!

15:30.030 --> 15:31.398
Selfie!

15:33.433 --> 15:34.501
Ahh!

15:34.534 --> 15:35.302
What'd I miss?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.204
Neither of us is
going to Homecoming.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.705
Ugh, yes you are.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.609
We still have a shot at this
thing, nothing is impossible.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.411
Except kissing
your own elbow.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.246
Believe me, I've tried.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.514
Good pep talk,
Sun Hi.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.517
Especially the part that made me
picture you kissing your elbow.

15:53.620 --> 16:06.066
(violin plays)

16:06.099 --> 16:07.500
Sad song.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.768
Yeah.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.337
It's an original piece.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.538
I call it,

16:11.571 --> 16:14.307
"Literal Interpretation of My
Current Emotional State."

16:14.341 --> 16:17.044
Catchy.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.611
Things that bad, huh?

16:18.645 --> 16:22.315
I don't want to run for
Homecoming Court anymore.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.317
Well, if that's what
you think is best.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.318
Too bad though.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.720
I was coming around to
the idea of me and you

16:27.754 --> 16:31.024
on Homecoming
Court together.

16:31.058 --> 16:31.758
You were?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.027
Uh-oh, too much
information.

16:34.061 --> 16:34.727
I gotta go.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.668
I talked to Jared, I'm going
to stay in the race.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.370
That's great,
Corki.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.106
At least my
dress will be there.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.474
Oh, no, Corki.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.576
Your campaign to become
invisible in this school,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.644
didn't exactly work out.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.680
I can still see you!

16:53.713 --> 16:56.183
Sun Hi, don't do it.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.151
Argh.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.752
Fine, If that's what
you want, Corki.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.789
I guess sometimes in life,
it's best to just admit defeat

17:02.822 --> 17:04.457
and walk away.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.460
Glad you
finally smartened up.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.462
I'm impressed, Sun Hi.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.764
You handled
that very maturely.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.833
Our little girl
is growing up.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.668
It was bound to
happen eventually.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.571
(screaming)

17:20.773 --> 17:21.574
Or not.

17:31.218 --> 17:31.818
You.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.753
Oh Valerie!

17:33.786 --> 17:36.489
You match
your bathrobe!

17:36.523 --> 17:39.092
This isn't over!

17:41.561 --> 17:44.131
I guess the guy at the joke
Store wasn't kidding

17:44.164 --> 17:46.466
when he said, a little
goes a long way.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.702
Sun Hi, I told you this isn't
how I want to conduct myself.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.106
I'm not like them, I want
to stay true to who I am

17:53.140 --> 17:55.375
and what I believe
no matter what.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.144
It's time you
start respecting that.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.315
It washes off.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.250
Eventually.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.119
*

18:06.153 --> 18:09.122
(cheering)

18:14.494 --> 18:19.666
* They say you'll
know when it's true *

18:19.699 --> 18:24.737
* But what I'm feeling,
it's just all so brand new *

18:24.771 --> 18:29.776
* They say you'll
know when it's right *

18:29.809 --> 18:33.680
* But I've never been here
before, I've never tried *

18:33.713 --> 18:36.516
* I wanna know,
wanna know *

18:36.549 --> 18:38.818
* What this love is about

18:38.851 --> 18:43.823
* I, I don't know what I'm
feeling gotta figure it out *

18:43.856 --> 18:47.294
* I wanna know,
gotta know *

18:47.327 --> 18:51.898
* What all of this
could lead to *

18:51.931 --> 19:00.673
* Am I really falling for you
Ohh-ohh- Falling for you *

19:00.707 --> 19:05.612
* Ohh, Ohhh

19:05.645 --> 19:10.650
* You say you
wanna be friends *

19:10.683 --> 19:15.722
* We play it cool but
it's so hard to pretend *

19:15.755 --> 19:19.959
* Deep down I think
we both know *

19:19.992 --> 19:22.962
* You and I and what we
have could some how *

19:22.995 --> 19:25.965
* Continue to grow

19:25.998 --> 19:33.906
* Not a day goes by without
me thinking about you *

19:33.940 --> 19:36.376
* And your sweet smile .

19:36.409 --> 19:50.457
* Could we one
day be together, Oooh *

19:50.490 --> 19:52.925
* I wanna know,
wanna know *

19:52.959 --> 19:56.496
* What this love is about

19:56.529 --> 20:00.600
* I don't know what I'm
feeling gotta figure it out *

20:00.633 --> 20:03.603
* I wanna know,
gotta know *.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.973
* What all of this
could lead to *

20:07.006 --> 20:08.475
* Whoaa

20:08.508 --> 20:15.348
* Am I really
falling for you? *

20:15.382 --> 20:20.420
* Fallin for youuu

20:20.453 --> 20:23.923
* Ohh, Ohhh
Falling for you *

20:23.956 --> 20:28.728
* Oh, Ohh,
Gotta know, Gotta know *

20:28.761 --> 20:32.799
* Am I really
falling for you *

20:32.832 --> 20:38.505
(cheering)

20:38.538 --> 20:40.940
Jodi: Check it out, some
Corki fans in the crowd.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.523
I'm gonna need
more power.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.326
It'll be fun to see you
get on the Homecoming court.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.393
You mean
you're coming?

21:00.427 --> 21:01.628
Yeah.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.796
I don't need a
date to have fun.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.432
Great, Jodi.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.367
Just don't plan
on talking to me.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.337
I'll be busy getting mobbed by
fans after my solo performance.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.572
And then Mr. Stark
will cast me as Dorothy,

21:12.605 --> 21:14.474
and my career
will be launched.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.909
Ah, it's good
to be me.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.547
This could end up being an
awesome Homecoming after all.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.881
(crashing)

21:21.914 --> 21:24.050
What was that?

21:30.757 --> 21:33.426
That would be another
safety violation.
