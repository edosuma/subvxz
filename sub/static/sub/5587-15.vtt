ADULT ADAM:
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.168 --> 00:04.036
<i> everyone had their favorite</i>
<i> guitar-shredding rock god.</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:06.005
<i> But there's only one</i>
<i> musical bad boy</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:08.140
<i> who rocked my world.</i>

00:09.076 --> 00:10.209
<i> Weird Al.</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:11.810
Dare to be stupid?

00:11.812 --> 00:12.277
You know it!

00:12.279 --> 00:13.979
<i> Weird Al made me want</i>
<i> to write comedy.</i>

00:13.981 --> 00:17.383
<i> The way he'd parody a pop song</i>
<i> never ceased to amaze me.</i>

00:17.385 --> 00:19.418
Is that my Cher wig
from Halloween?

00:19.420 --> 00:20.019
Darn right.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.721
Can I borrow some hair spray?
I think I need more body.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.422
You are so weird.

00:23.424 --> 00:27.026
<i> Weird Al even inspired me</i>
<i> to write my own parody songs.</i>

00:27.028 --> 00:27.559
Good news, bro.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.561
I've decided to honor you
in song.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.162
It's about time!

00:30.164 --> 00:32.364
You know the Wang Chung song
<i> Everybody have fun tonight?</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:35.034
Well, I changed all the lyrics
to make them all about you.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.770
Ah, you've improved the song.
Let's hear it.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.873
<i> ¶ Everybody have fun tonight</i>

00:40.875 --> 00:43.776
<i> ¶ My brother Barry</i>
<i> is a wang tonight</i>

00:43.778 --> 00:46.378
<i> ¶ Barry's gonna</i>
<i> kick your ass tonight ¶</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.213
<i> Yep, Weird Al</i>
<i> was my comic muse,</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.816
<i> and I finally had the chance</i>
<i> to see him live.</i>

00:50.818 --> 00:53.919
Mom, I have the single
greatest news on the planet.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.188
You have that
terrible disease that
makes you stop growing,

00:56.190 --> 00:58.724
and you're gonna stay
my little schmoopie forever.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.393
No. Weird Al is playing
at the Mann Music Center.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.630
And you want to take
your mama as your date. Aw.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.099
Stop hearing
what you want and listen.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.400
He has two shows
this week,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.636
and Dana's in town
visiting her grandma.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.937
I'll surprise her
with tickets!

01:11.939 --> 01:14.206
While I find his
Hawaiian shirts festive,

01:14.208 --> 01:14.973
you're much too young

01:14.975 --> 01:17.476
to go to a family-friendly
comedy show unsupervised.

01:17.478 --> 01:21.413
Please, you have to say yes.
Dana's the love of my life.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.414
(GROANS)

01:22.416 --> 01:24.483
I mean, after you.
(GROANS)

01:24.485 --> 01:25.918
The best mama in the world.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.452
(GROANS)

01:26.454 --> 01:29.121
I'll let you sniff the top
of my head for two seconds.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.122
Thirty.
Five.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.356
Ten.
Five.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.758
Thirty.
Done.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.093
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:34.095 --> 01:35.394
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:35.396 --> 01:39.531
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:41.402 --> 01:42.334
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:42.336 --> 01:46.271
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:46.273 --> 01:48.740
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was February 12,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

01:48.742 --> 01:51.543
<i> the day my brother actually</i>
<i> got involved in school.</i>

01:51.545 --> 01:53.879
What's that?
Just a lame old
sign-up sheet

01:53.881 --> 01:56.181
for kids that want to
become peer counselors.

01:56.183 --> 01:59.318
(CHUCKLES) It's a boring
old club for nerds.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.819
You're not a nerd,
are you?

02:00.821 --> 02:03.589
'Cause this here,
this is nerd city.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.457
Sign me up.
What? No.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.125
You're underselling it,

02:06.127 --> 02:08.393
which means it's awesome,
and I want in.

02:08.395 --> 02:08.994
(SIGHS)

02:08.996 --> 02:11.263
Look, Mr. Goldberg,
I have dreamt of starting

02:11.265 --> 02:14.399
a peer-counseling program
at this school for years.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.001
I need emotionally
mature students

02:16.003 --> 02:18.537
who are a healing presence
in school.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.471
Well, you just got yourself

02:19.473 --> 02:21.940
an officially licensed
school therapist.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.977
No! Wow.
Do not tell people that.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.278
It's too late.
I signed the sheet,

02:26.280 --> 02:29.414
which means I can advise
anyone on anything,

02:29.416 --> 02:31.350
and they have to
listen to me.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.317
That's not what it means.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.988
Fellas, I've recently become
a fully licensed and bonded

02:35.990 --> 02:37.623
medical psychiatrist,
so if any of you want

02:37.625 --> 02:41.059
to work through
your personal issues,
this is your safe space.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.227
I really miss
my grandpa.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.796
You're short, be taller.
Boom. Next!

02:44.798 --> 02:45.764
There's this girl I like,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.099
but she won't give me
the time of day.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.201
Well, that's 'cause
you suck at nunchucks, bro.

02:49.203 --> 02:52.771
The fastest way to a girl's
heart is some sweet chuckin'.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.372
Boom. Next!

02:53.374 --> 02:55.541
I feel like my father
doesn't respect me.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.341
So be less boring.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.376
Boom! Next!
No, stop!

02:57.378 --> 03:00.312
No one listen to a word
this douche-monger just said.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.614
Naked Rob, just open up
to your dad a bit.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.749
Nothing earns respect more

03:03.751 --> 03:04.716
than being honest
with how you feel.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.686
And, Andy,
it's perfectly normal
to miss your grandpa,

03:07.688 --> 03:08.887
no matter
what size you are.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.590
And, you, this girl,
who's clearly me,

03:11.592 --> 03:12.424
just wants to be friends.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.561
My heart hurts,
but I appreciate
the open communication,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.596
and it only
makes me like you more.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.197
Well, well.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.666
God gives you one Goldberg
and counters it with another.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.935
You're right.
She's the worst.

03:22.937 --> 03:23.535
JTP out.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.004
Erica, look, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush
about this.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.639
I need you to become
a peer counselor.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.909
You're smart,
you're popular,
and only you can undo

03:30.911 --> 03:32.477
the terrible damage
that your brother

03:32.479 --> 03:34.179
is going to wreak
upon this school.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.314
I appreciate
the offer, but--

03:35.316 --> 03:37.983
I'll give you an "A"
in any class you want.

03:37.985 --> 03:38.684
What? You can do that?

03:38.686 --> 03:41.286
Open up a file cabinet
and make a mark with my pen?

03:41.288 --> 03:43.222
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, I can do that.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.090
Seems wrong to give me
an "A" in gym

03:45.092 --> 03:47.159
when I've been
cutting all year.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.093
That said,
I won't notice

03:48.095 --> 03:50.128
'cause I'll be too busy
counseling peers and stuff.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.797
(CHUCKLES) Deal.
(MILK CARTON CLATTERS)

03:51.799 --> 03:54.566
Here's your
informational binder

03:54.568 --> 03:56.134
and your therapy puppet.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.369
This is usually
for smaller kids,

03:57.371 --> 03:59.471
but the burners
like it, too. (CHUCKLES)

03:59.473 --> 04:02.241
ADULT ADAM: <i> As Erica</i>
<i> was getting ready</i>
<i> to connect with others,</i>

04:02.243 --> 04:05.544
<i> I was about to reconnect</i>
<i> with the love of my life.</i>

04:05.546 --> 04:06.778
Hi, Mrs. Goldberg.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.247
Dana.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.915
I brought you some
coffee beans from Seattle.

04:09.917 --> 04:14.419
Aw. That is so thoughtful
for someone who drinks coffee.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.021
I don't.
I'm a tea drinker.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.289
You've known me
for two years,

04:17.291 --> 04:19.191
but thanks
for the partial gift, Dana.

04:19.193 --> 04:20.826
That's very sweet.
(CHUCKLES)

04:20.828 --> 04:23.595
Adam, Dana brought me
a bag of beans!

04:23.597 --> 04:27.199
Dana Eleanor Caldwell,
are you ready
for the greatest,

04:27.201 --> 04:29.534
most romantic weekend
of your life?

04:29.536 --> 04:30.636
(GIGGLES)
In this box,

04:30.638 --> 04:32.304
I've prepared
our greatest hits,

04:32.306 --> 04:35.340
and we're gonna
tackle each one.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.644
Laser tag,
<i> ALF</i> marathon,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.979
Super Mario Bros.,

04:40.981 --> 04:41.613
pogo ball.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.483
You in?
Um, sure,
it's been a while.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.219
Come on! Pogo balling
is just like riding a bike.

04:47.221 --> 04:50.155
Oh! We should
also ride bikes.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.523
Classic us. (GIGGLES)

04:51.525 --> 04:53.659
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But to our surprise,</i>

04:53.661 --> 04:56.828
<i> our greatest hits</i>
<i> suddenly felt like misses.</i>

04:56.830 --> 04:58.430
Pogoing on a ball is fun.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.799
Well, it's kind of hard
in these jellies.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.701
But they're cute, right?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.169
Yeah, they're shoes.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.070
<i> We were off to a slow start,</i>

05:05.072 --> 05:07.806
<i> but a romantic</i>
<i> Beefaroni dinner</i>
<i> would change that.</i>

05:07.808 --> 05:10.709
Is it me,
or did your tree house
get smaller?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.210
No. Same size.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.546
Guess it's us
who got bigger.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.115
You want an Ecto Cooler?

05:17.117 --> 05:20.218
Chef Boyardee himself
recommends it with the beef.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.121
Yeah, I'm just gonna
grab a Perrier.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.456
(THUDS)

05:24.458 --> 05:26.024
Balls!

05:26.960 --> 05:30.195
Maybe I should
spend a little time
with my grandma.

05:30.197 --> 05:30.829
No, wait!

05:30.831 --> 05:32.297
I actually have
a big surprise for you.

05:32.299 --> 05:37.035
You and me are going to our
first rock concert together!

05:37.037 --> 05:38.103
No way! Who is it?

05:38.105 --> 05:40.372
Only the greatest artist
of our time.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.406
Madonna?
Better!

05:41.408 --> 05:42.341
The Police?
Better!

05:42.343 --> 05:43.909
Michael Jackson?
Well, he's worked
with all three,

05:43.911 --> 05:45.677
but in a way,
he's improved their work

05:45.679 --> 05:47.012
by making it super funny!

05:47.014 --> 05:49.247
(GASPS)
Weird Al Yankovic!

05:49.249 --> 05:51.383
The guy who sings about food.

05:51.385 --> 05:55.587
Sure, some songs
are about food,
like <i> Eat it, Lasagna,</i>

05:55.589 --> 05:58.056
<i> I love rocky road,</i>
and <i> My bologna.</i>

05:58.058 --> 06:01.460
But he also sings about
love and life and hernias!

06:01.462 --> 06:04.296
I didn't realize
you were still into him.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.263
And the best part...

06:05.265 --> 06:08.500
I got us Al shirts
to wear to the concert.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.001
Ladies' choice.
(CHUCKLES)

06:10.003 --> 06:10.702
But if I were a lady,

06:10.704 --> 06:14.005
I'd want to see my man
in a jungle tiger pattern.

06:14.007 --> 06:14.506
Rawr!

06:14.508 --> 06:15.907
<i> As I was planning</i>
<i> our big date,</i>

06:15.909 --> 06:18.477
<i> Erica helped Naked Rob</i>
<i> make a big breakthrough.</i>

06:18.479 --> 06:21.680
I can't thank you enough
for all the help with my dad.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.615
I really think
we turned a corner.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.385
That's my job, Naked Robert.
I'm here for you.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.987
So great to have someone
I can trust and--

06:28.989 --> 06:30.422
How dare you!
What?

06:30.424 --> 06:33.458
Healing my nutjob friends
behind my back?

06:33.460 --> 06:35.227
You're not legally authorized
for that.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.095
Only I am!
Not anymore, pal.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.331
Mr. Glascott asked me,
and you know what?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.266
It feels awesome
to actually help people.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.802
Unlike you, who just leaves
behind a wake of broken souls.

06:43.804 --> 06:47.506
All you did was
charm Naked Rob
with your feminine wiles.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.642
If it was anyone else,
I'd totally out-counsel you.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.476
It's adorable
you think that.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.413
Then I challenge you
to a counsel-off.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.280
Name anyone.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.048
First one to fix
that person's brain

06:57.050 --> 06:59.751
is crowned
champion adviser.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.919
First of all, not a word,

07:00.921 --> 07:03.688
and second,
when you lose, you quit.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.123
Same goes for you,
sucker.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.925
Go ahead.
Pick anybody.

07:06.927 --> 07:07.793
The more depressed,
the better.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.896
Do you even know
what the signs of
depression actually are?

07:10.898 --> 07:11.463
Of course!

07:11.465 --> 07:15.000
I just need you
to say them so you can
understand them better.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.202
(SIGHS) Fine.
Number one, fatigue.

07:17.204 --> 07:21.239
Will you two stop yapping?
I'm exhausted from a hard day.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.941
Number two, lethargy.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.443
(GROANING) Oh, so far.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.243
Number three, irritability.

07:25.245 --> 07:30.048
I told you two morons,
put the remote
in the side pocket!

07:30.050 --> 07:31.817
Four, persistent
aches and pains.

07:31.819 --> 07:36.521
(GROANS) Oh, now I hurt
my back from stretching!

07:36.523 --> 07:37.556
Five, mood swings.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.257
Eh, <i> Love Boat's</i> on!

07:39.259 --> 07:42.060
And finally,
sudden exhaustion.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.161
(SNORING)

07:43.163 --> 07:44.663
BOTH: Dad!

07:44.765 --> 07:46.164
All right, first one
to fix that man's

07:46.166 --> 07:46.998
crippling depression wins.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.167
This is gonna be
really hard.

07:49.169 --> 07:49.601
(SNORING)

07:49.603 --> 07:52.037
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica and Barry</i>
<i> were playing therapist,</i>

07:52.039 --> 07:54.172
<i> Dana and I were playing</i>
<i> Mario Bros.,</i>

07:54.174 --> 07:56.241
<i> but even though</i>
<i> we were on the same side,</i>

07:56.243 --> 07:57.609
<i> we felt miles apart.</i>

07:57.611 --> 07:59.544
Hey, snuggle bunny,
and also Dana.

07:59.546 --> 08:02.481
Gear up, we're gonna leave
in five minutes.

08:03.050 --> 08:03.849
Even though we all agree

08:03.851 --> 08:06.184
Adam should be taking me
to his first comedy concert.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.187
The good news is
Adam will be
all yours soon enough.

08:09.189 --> 08:13.558
What do you mean?
Look at how they're playing
"super immigrant plumbers."

08:13.560 --> 08:16.228
Their thumbs are in it,
but their hearts aren't.

08:16.230 --> 08:19.498
No way. Adam and Dana
are as solid as ever.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.132
Did you see them pogo ball?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.400
That's a sport for lovers,

08:22.402 --> 08:25.737
and they were just
going through the motions.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.172
Oh, my God. No!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.741
Adam and Dana
are so wonderful together!

08:29.743 --> 08:31.409
Since when do you like Dana?

08:31.411 --> 08:32.777
I adore the girl.

08:32.779 --> 08:33.879
Got to say, I'm surprised,

08:33.881 --> 08:36.515
given all the
passive-aggressive
interactions,

08:36.517 --> 08:39.217
not to mention
the aggressive-aggressive
ones.

08:39.219 --> 08:43.955
But deep down, I think she's
sweet and kind and beautiful,

08:43.957 --> 08:46.758
and it helps that
she lives 3,000 miles away

08:46.760 --> 08:49.461
and I get Adam
98% of the time!

08:49.463 --> 08:51.830
That's the whole problem
right there, Bevy.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.298
They've been apart
too long.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.101
Let's hope that Weird Al
is just what they need

08:56.103 --> 08:58.236
to bring them
back together.

08:58.238 --> 08:58.870
What?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.071
CROWD: (CHANTING)
<i> Weird Al!</i>

09:00.073 --> 09:04.476
ANNOUNCER:
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i> Weird Al!</i>

09:04.478 --> 09:05.310
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

09:05.312 --> 09:06.778
Oh, my God.
This is amazing!

09:06.780 --> 09:08.680
We got to get a photo
of the two of us.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.614
Yeah, that'd be nice!

09:09.616 --> 09:13.218
Make sure you get
Weird Al's whole body in it.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.022
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

09:21.461 --> 09:24.462
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Barry and Erica's</i>
<i> counsel-off was on.</i>

09:24.464 --> 09:26.031
<i> It was a mano-a-mano battle</i>

09:26.033 --> 09:28.366
<i> of who could fix Dad first.</i>

09:28.368 --> 09:30.368
Hey, big guy.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.370
How you feeling today?
You look sad.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.305
Are you sad?
Can I help?

09:33.307 --> 09:36.508
I'm not giving you money.
I'm not here for money.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.309
I'm here for you.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.510
You're afraid
to open up to me.

09:38.512 --> 09:41.913
Feels like we can tackle this
with some word association.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.248
You ready?
No.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.683
Abandonment.
Stop.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.517
Family.
Go!

09:45.519 --> 09:47.586
Love.
Leave!

09:47.654 --> 09:48.820
You seem angry, bro.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.889
Know what cures me
when I'm angry?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.757
Screaming into something.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.559
Here. Try my rage pillow.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.460
It'll make you
feel better.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.363
What? You're supposed
to yell in it,
not throw it at me!

09:58.365 --> 10:01.066
What's the matter with you?
That's my favorite pillow!

10:01.068 --> 10:02.667
I do feel better.

10:02.669 --> 10:03.468
ERICA: Hey, Mur-man.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.403
It's safe to tell me
your dark secrets.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.472
What's with the puppet?
What's going on?

10:07.474 --> 10:08.106
Get out of here!

10:08.108 --> 10:11.876
You're getting sleepy.
When you wake up--

10:11.878 --> 10:13.878
What the hell's
wrong with you two?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.513
Forget what
that dope's doing.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.716
All I'm looking for
is a smile on your face.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.251
Let me see that smile.
Yeah, smile for Barry.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.052
No.
Shut up.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.921
Smile for Erica!
Fine.

10:22.923 --> 10:26.658
If I smile,
will you both leave?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.426
Mmm-hmm.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.429
That's your smile? Why?
God, what is that?

10:31.431 --> 10:32.864
Yeah, this is
what you wanted.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.165
It's so wrong
and disturbing!

10:34.167 --> 10:35.000
Look at it!
Stop it!

10:35.002 --> 10:37.636
Look at the joy on my face!
Are you my dad?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.037
Now get over here
and hug me!

10:39.039 --> 10:40.472
This was a terrible mistake!
I'm so sorry!

10:40.474 --> 10:43.375
No, wait! Don't leave me
alone with that face!
Oh, my God!

10:43.377 --> 10:45.143
That's right!
Run!

10:45.145 --> 10:46.144
Okay, that didn't count.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.813
Just pick someone else
we can counselor-ate.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.681
Forget the competition!

10:49.683 --> 10:53.084
Don't you realize we have
a dad who can't even smile?

10:53.086 --> 10:55.053
That's like
an actual problem.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.187
I see what you're saying.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.123
You forfeit! Barry wins.
The puppet's mine.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.891
Forget the puppet!
I want the puppet!

10:59.893 --> 11:03.194
Take the stupid puppet.
I'll just help Dad myself.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.397
Damn it. You've made this
a hollow victory.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.598
And now I'm worried.
Wait up.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.868
<i> As Barry and Erica were</i>
<i> on a mission to help my dad,</i>

11:09.870 --> 11:12.170
<i> I was on a mission</i>
<i> to meet my hero.</i>

11:12.172 --> 11:13.371
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Look! There he is!

11:13.373 --> 11:15.907
His glasses are
so much bigger
in real life.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.743
People, please,
please, please,
settle down.

11:18.745 --> 11:19.778
No, we're too far back.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.946
Come on. Let's elbow
our way to the front.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.449
Can we maybe just do
something more fun instead?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.283
How can you say that?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.985
Wasn't it fun
when we slow-danced

11:26.987 --> 11:28.319
to <i> I Think I'm a Clone Now?</i>

11:28.321 --> 11:30.188
Only 'cause I like
the Tiffany song.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.558
I closed my eyes
and imagined
the original lyrics.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.125
You faked it?

11:34.127 --> 11:37.429
I just don't like Weird Al
like I used to, okay?

11:37.431 --> 11:37.796
Ouch!

11:37.798 --> 11:40.598
Not gonna lie,
random child.
That stings.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.834
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Mr. Weird.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.803
Mr. Al.
She didn't mean it.

11:44.805 --> 11:45.603
Sounded like she did, bro.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.138
Please don't judge me
by her words.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.640
I don't even know her.
Adam!

11:48.642 --> 11:50.842
How do you know my name,
strange lady?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.545
Seriously?
You're picking him
over me?

11:53.547 --> 11:54.412
I don't know what to do!

11:54.414 --> 11:56.114
I've never been asked
to choose between

11:56.116 --> 11:57.849
two people I love equally.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.884
I'm so out of here.

11:59.953 --> 12:00.585
Fine! Go!

12:00.587 --> 12:03.221
I'll just be here
cold chillin' with
my new best buddy, Al.

12:03.223 --> 12:07.492
Ooh. (CHUCKLES)
I really wouldn't make me
part of your plan.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.628
Look. I didn't even
want to be here.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.396
I just wanted to hang out,

12:11.398 --> 12:14.799
not ride bikes
or play laser tag
or pogo ball.

12:14.801 --> 12:20.004
What are you saying?
I just don't think
we get each other anymore.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.042
Ooh!

12:24.044 --> 12:26.711
She looks super mad!

12:26.713 --> 12:28.146
Kind of like that time
I asked Prince

12:28.148 --> 12:34.419
if I could turn
<i> When doves cry</i>
into <i> When spuds fry.</i>

12:34.421 --> 12:36.020
You know,
spuds are potatoes.

12:36.022 --> 12:36.721
No, it's genius.

12:36.723 --> 12:40.091
It's just...
things are so bad with Dana.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.593
You know,
sounds to me like

12:41.595 --> 12:44.062
you and Agnes
just drifted apart.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.798
Doesn't mean you don't
love each other, Todd.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.966
You just grew up.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.936
<i> As Dana was slipping away,</i>
<i> Erica and Barry were trying</i>

12:51.938 --> 12:53.571
<i> to get a grip</i>
<i> on my dad's depression.</i>

12:53.573 --> 12:57.041
You kids made
the right choice
coming to old Glascott.

12:57.043 --> 12:57.609
Let's do this.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.512
Well, technically,
we came to you
for a recommendation.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.147
And I recommended myself.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.048
I come highly recommended.
(CHUCKLES)

13:04.050 --> 13:08.253
Look, if anyone knows
the ins and outs
of depression,

13:08.255 --> 13:08.720
it's me.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.589
I'm proud to say that
I've slayed that dragon
many a time.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.392
Dad's coming down the hall.
Get in position.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.228
Mr. Goldberg.

13:17.230 --> 13:17.896
Got your call.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.331
What'd these morons do that
I had to leave work early?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.633
Please, have a seat,
Mr. Goldberg.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.502
We need to have
a very serious discussion

13:24.504 --> 13:25.136
about you.
Me?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.807
Your kids are concerned
that you might have
a real case of the blues.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.776
Luckily, I'm here to help,
and so is Carl.

13:31.778 --> 13:35.113
He's a real sad sack, too.
Why don't you two talk?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.315
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Hey, Mr. Goldberg.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.116
What's up, buddy?

13:38.118 --> 13:39.951
What's with everybody
and puppets?

13:39.953 --> 13:40.785
You can talk to me.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.487
Is that what this
is all about?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.588
You're worried about me?

13:43.590 --> 13:46.224
You're very moody
and sleepy and angry.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.561
And you sit a lot.
I'm not depressed.

13:49.563 --> 13:49.994
I'm a dad!

13:49.996 --> 13:51.329
(NORMAL VOICE)
Let me get this straight.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.031
You don't struggle
getting out of bed
every morning

13:53.033 --> 13:53.932
because, what's the point?
No.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.901
You don't desperately
fear being alone
again at Thanksgiving?

13:56.903 --> 13:59.971
No.
You've never faced the bottom
of an ice-cream pint

13:59.973 --> 14:02.173
and thought, "Screw it.
I'm going again"?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.475
No.
You don't write "Help me"

14:04.477 --> 14:06.177
in the steam
on the shower door?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.078
What?
Nothing.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.747
Okay, well, look.
I'm glad that we could
help you, Mr. Goldberg.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.951
If you guys don't mind,
I need to take
a personal day.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.253
Hey, kiddo.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.655
I know you're hurting,
but you're never gonna be

14:17.657 --> 14:20.458
over one girl
until you're under the next.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.794
Whoa!
Shut the (BLEEP) up, Dad.

14:22.796 --> 14:26.197
What he means is
don't give up on Dana.

14:26.199 --> 14:26.998
We can still fix this.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.568
But Al's my number one hero,
and I believe
anything he says.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.971
What exactly did
Weird Al say to you?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.139
All that matters
is that he was right.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.675
People change
and love dies.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.777
ADULT ADAM:
<i> At that moment,</i>
<i> all my mom wanted</i>

14:39.779 --> 14:41.246
<i> was to fix my broken heart.</i>

14:41.248 --> 14:44.082
<i> And so she did</i>
<i> the only logical thing.</i>

14:44.084 --> 14:46.284
Weird Al!
Over here, Weird Al!

14:46.286 --> 14:48.720
We need to talk!
It's about love!

14:48.722 --> 14:50.154
(CLATTERS)
Who said that?

14:50.156 --> 14:51.956
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.992
Who is this
who speaks of love?

14:53.994 --> 14:55.927
(SIGHS) Beverly Goldberg.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.897
I'm sure you remember
my delicious boy, Adam.
Of course.

14:58.899 --> 15:03.101
Super-tall mute dude
with dreadlocks
and a droopy eye?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.903
Please tell him I said...

15:05.105 --> 15:08.840
No, look.
You made him think
his relationship was over,

15:08.842 --> 15:10.308
and now you're gonna fix it.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.010
It's not happening.
Oh, it's happening.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.244
You're gonna
get on that tour bus,

15:13.246 --> 15:16.347
take it into the suburbs,
and put on a private concert

15:16.349 --> 15:18.616
for Adam and Dana
with all their favorite songs.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.652
Such as?
<i> Every rose has its thorn.</i>

15:20.654 --> 15:22.120
<i> Every toe has its corn?</i>

15:22.122 --> 15:23.621
<i> The wind beneath my wings.</i>

15:23.623 --> 15:25.056
<i> The bed above my springs.</i>

15:25.058 --> 15:27.392
<i> Material girl.</i>
<i> Bacterial Earl!</i>

15:27.394 --> 15:28.927
<i> Heaven is a place on earth.</i>

15:28.929 --> 15:30.995
<i> Kevin is a dude with girth.</i>

15:30.997 --> 15:32.130
<i> Careless whisper.</i>

15:32.132 --> 15:32.997
<i> Your hairless sister.</i>

15:32.999 --> 15:35.833
<i> Fight the power.</i>
<i> Smell the flounder?</i>

15:35.835 --> 15:36.701
Stop it.
Listen.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.570
A private concert
isn't gonna bring those
kids back together.

15:39.572 --> 15:43.508
But do you know what can?
A mother's love.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.044
You think?
Yes.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.313
Only you can fix this.

15:48.315 --> 15:52.116
Their future
is in your hands.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.785
Thank you, Weird Al.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.853
Thank you so much.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.487
(GIGGLES)

15:56.489 --> 15:58.890
Move it! I need to fix
my baby's relationship.

15:58.892 --> 16:02.126
Okay, why do I even
pay for security?

16:02.128 --> 16:06.864
She was clearly crazy,
and you just stood there! Ugh!

ADULT ADAM:

<i> from Weird Al,</i>

16:10.403 --> 16:12.937
<i> my mom decided</i>
<i> to put on a show of her own.</i>

16:12.939 --> 16:15.239
There he is!
Come on in, smushie.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.608
You know Dana.
Have a seat.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.043
Oh, God.
What have you done?

16:19.045 --> 16:20.478
What is this?
Why are you here?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.714
All I'm asking
is for a minute
of your time.

16:22.716 --> 16:26.417
After that, you can both
move on with your lives.
Please.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.019
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

16:28.021 --> 16:30.054
Now, what I'm about
to show you

16:30.056 --> 16:31.089
was gonna be played
at your wedding,

16:31.091 --> 16:34.425
so when the day comes,
act surprised.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.060
(BEVERLY CHUCKLES)

16:36.062 --> 16:37.128
Remember this?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.396
DANA: Wow, I actually do.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.665
I lost my kite,
and you gave me yours.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.868
I was so nervous
talking to you.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.405
That was the night
of our first kiss.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.741
Yeah.
Best birthday ever.

16:49.743 --> 16:53.044
Wait. Were you, like,
lurking around the whole time?
No.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.380
Then how did you--
Moving on.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.715
Dude, were you
spying on us?

16:57.717 --> 16:58.383
What? No.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.351
I was cleaning the closet,
and, you know--

17:00.353 --> 17:03.321
Shh! Just focus on your love.

17:03.323 --> 17:03.955
ADAM: What the...

17:03.957 --> 17:05.323
You took that
hanging off the roof?

17:05.325 --> 17:08.426
A photographer does
what she needs to do
to get the shot.

17:08.428 --> 17:12.797
The point is,
it's always been
Adam and Dana.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.899
You can't just
throw that away.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.202
Enough!
All those photos
are in the past.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.070
There's nothing to show now

17:19.072 --> 17:22.573
'cause Dana lives in Seattle
and I'm stuck here.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.844
It just isn't the same.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.717
He's right.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.987
Seeing those photos, it's...
It's not us anymore.

17:35.989 --> 17:39.023
I just wish you two
didn't leave it like this.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.625
You deserve
so much better.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.194
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.330
I just thought
I could fix it.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.166
I'm kind of surprised.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.601
I always thought
you didn't like me.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.603
Oh, Dana.

17:52.605 --> 17:57.275
You'll always be
the best first love
my baby could have.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.279
Besides me, of course.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.736
This is how you won me over

So this is how I want
to say goodbye.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.614
I thought you don't
like him anymore.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.382
I may have outgrown him,

18:38.384 --> 18:40.585
but it doesn't mean
I still don't like him.

18:40.587 --> 18:44.989
I just thought we'd be
together forever, you know?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.691
And maybe we will.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.558
But for now,

18:47.560 --> 18:50.194
I think we're
supposed to be apart.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.662
That still doesn't
change the fact

18:51.664 --> 18:54.899
that you will always be
my first crush.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.168
My first kiss.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.070
My first love.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.075
You keep it.
To remember me.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.777
I will always
remember you, Adam.

No.
Not about feelings.

19:21.961 --> 19:22.727
We just want to apologize.

Yeah, we didn't realize

you crazy happy.

I watch TV.

I yell at you two morons.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.873
And honestly,
that's my happy place.

Well, it's good to know
we don't have to
worry about you.
