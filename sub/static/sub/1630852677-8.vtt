- What?
Why?

28:56.647 --> 28:58.258
- Ben just got a call
from some company

28:58.301 --> 29:00.129
that wants to put
a resort here.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.740
Says he's gonna be
mayor for decades.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.133
- Nobody's putting
a resort here.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.308
What are you talking about?

29:05.352 --> 29:06.701
- I don't know.
He says he took pictures

29:06.745 --> 29:08.442
of the Grady land
to sell them on the idea,

29:08.485 --> 29:09.965
and now they want to do it.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.619
- What?
He said he was using

29:11.662 --> 29:13.490
those pictures
for the town website.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.102
What?

29:16.145 --> 29:17.320
- Excuse me.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.499
Hey, didn't realize
you were still here.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.284
- Yeah, just thought
I'd grab something to eat.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.460
- That was like an hour ago.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.244
- I guess I've been eating
for an hour.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.247
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.379
- [mutters]
Didn't realize I hired Jughead

29:32.422 --> 29:34.250
to deliver the cake.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.904
Hey,
what are you two talking about?

29:35.948 --> 29:38.037
- Oh, I was just catching up
with D'arcy

29:38.080 --> 29:40.300
about the pictures
that you took for the resort.

29:40.343 --> 29:41.780
- You know, the ones
that you lied to me about,

29:41.823 --> 29:43.607
that you said were
for the "town website."

29:43.651 --> 29:46.132
- Well, I plan on using those
pictures for the town website

29:46.175 --> 29:47.698
as well, so...
not a lie.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.439
Hey, uh,
should I order more food?

29:49.483 --> 29:51.311
'Cause Jay is going through it
like a lawnmower.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.139
- Nope, you totally lied to me.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.531
I mean, Jesus.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.533
We spent the whole day
rock climbing, ATVing,

29:56.577 --> 29:57.926
what, so you could
just bring in a resort

29:57.970 --> 29:59.101
and destroy the town?

29:59.145 --> 30:00.624
- Uh, you went rock climbing?

30:00.668 --> 30:02.713
- [stammering]
A little bit--small rock.

30:02.757 --> 30:05.412
- So when I got home from my
mom's, and I said, you know,

30:05.455 --> 30:07.414
"What have you been doing?"
and you said, "Nothing,"

30:07.457 --> 30:10.373
was "nothing" rock climbing
with D'arcy?

30:10.417 --> 30:11.984
- Uh... you know, I mean,

30:12.027 --> 30:14.900
isn't "nothing" kind of like
a catchall expression?

30:14.943 --> 30:16.336
I mean, it really could mean
lots of different things.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.859
- No.
It means nothing.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.296
You know, what you and D'arcy
did, it wasn't nothing.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.385
It was something,
and for some reason,

30:22.429 --> 30:24.648
you just didn't tell me
about it.

30:24.692 --> 30:25.998
- I just didn't think
it was a big deal.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.695
- Oh shit.
Uh, look.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.610
[clears throat]
I hate to insert myself here,

30:29.653 --> 30:31.612
but it looks like Ben
could use a little help,

30:31.655 --> 30:33.527
so just know
D'arcy kissed Ben,

30:33.570 --> 30:34.702
not the other way around.

30:34.745 --> 30:37.400
He's a completely
innocent bystander.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.489
- You kissed Ben?

30:39.533 --> 30:40.447
- [nervously laughs]

30:40.490 --> 30:42.928

You two kissed...

30:49.282 --> 30:50.674
each other!
- I told you to tell her

30:50.718 --> 30:52.067
about the kiss.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.503
- You know, this is on me.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.332
I was drunk
and in a really horrible place.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.681
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.248
It's not Ben's fault.
- Well put.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.554
- Well,
if it wasn't your fault,

31:00.597 --> 31:01.860
then why wouldn't you
just tell me about it?

31:01.903 --> 31:03.209
I mean, then again,
why would you?

31:03.252 --> 31:04.993
'Cause I'm only just now
hearing about you putting

31:05.037 --> 31:06.342
a stupid resort in town.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.735
- What resort?

31:07.778 --> 31:09.128
You can't put a resort
in Patience.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.347
- See?
I didn't tell anybody.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.915
- Is this the resort you were
talking about that Ben wanted?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.264
- Yeah.
I think it's a bad idea.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.831
so does my mom.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.093
- I might've told Mike,
thought he could keep a secret.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.660
- You can't keep
secrets from somebody

31:19.703 --> 31:21.096
who buys your bear claws
every morning.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.272
- It took two bear claws
to find out about the kiss.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.187
- Why is everyone
listening to this?

31:25.231 --> 31:28.016
- 'Cause you're having a
public fight, and we have ears.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.017
- I'm not having a fight.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.671
I am explaining to my wife

31:30.714 --> 31:31.715
why I didn't tell her

31:31.759 --> 31:32.673
about hanging out with D'arcy

31:32.716 --> 31:33.717
a couple nights ago.

31:33.761 --> 31:34.893
- So you hung out at night too?

31:34.936 --> 31:35.981
- Okay, now it's a fight.

31:36.024 --> 31:37.199
- I'm not fighting.

31:37.243 --> 31:38.984
I don't care
if he hangs out with D'arcy.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.899
They're friends.
I--I--

31:40.942 --> 31:41.812
I just don't know
why you wouldn't

31:41.856 --> 31:43.510
just tell me about this.

31:43.553 --> 31:47.601
- After we left the Grady land,
D'Arcy came back to the house.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.386
She found some weed that
she had hid in Max's closet,

31:50.430 --> 31:51.605
and we smoked it.

31:51.648 --> 31:54.042
- Wait, you hid pot
in my son's closet?

31:54.086 --> 31:55.217
- Yeah, but I hid it
back in high school

31:55.261 --> 31:56.436
when I was bangin'
your husband.

31:56.479 --> 31:57.567
- Ho, ho, ho...

31:57.611 --> 31:59.569

for a hard joke.

31:59.613 --> 32:00.614
- No.
- No.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.050
- Look, this is ridiculous.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.009
Nothing happened.
She fell asleep.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.402
I tucked her into Max's bed.
End of story.

32:06.446 --> 32:07.882
- Wait, you slept over?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.928
- Ho, ho, it appears the story
has a few more chapters.

32:09.971 --> 32:10.885
- Wait,
you smoked 15-year-old weed?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.018
- I did.
It was not good.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.976
- Ben--
- Yes, D'arcy slept over

32:15.020 --> 32:17.065
in Max's bed,
and I am telling you now

32:17.109 --> 32:19.372
because I have nothing to hide.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.069
- So where were you when
I came home the next morning?

32:21.113 --> 32:22.679
- Ben told me to hide.
I snuck out the window.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.072
- I made a gesture.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.595
You took it to mean hide.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.075
- I also stole
one of your kid's candy bars.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.511
I'm sorry.
- I can't believe this.

32:28.555 --> 32:30.426
You were hiding in my house?

32:30.470 --> 32:31.862
We hung out after that.

32:31.906 --> 32:34.648
You couldn't just tell me
all of this?

32:34.691 --> 32:36.867
This whole thing was fake.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.695
I really thought
you were my friend.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.959
- No, I am your friend.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.699
- She apologized
for kissing Ben.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.745
- I don't care about that,
okay?

32:44.788 --> 32:46.834
It's a stupid kiss.
Who cares?

32:46.877 --> 32:49.097
D'arcy was drunk and sad.
Big surprise.

32:49.141 --> 32:50.620

if you didn't freak out so hard

32:50.664 --> 32:52.100
about your husband
hanging a sign on the wall,

32:52.144 --> 32:53.232

33:02.023 --> 33:03.546
who's real and available
is too scary.

learn to talk to Ben
