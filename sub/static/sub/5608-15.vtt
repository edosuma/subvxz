WEBVTT

00:04.881 --> 00:06.048
GARRETT:
Well, that's what you said.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.814
I did not say
"when hell freezes over."

00:07.817 --> 00:08.750
What then?

00:08.753 --> 00:10.519
I said I will make my decision

00:10.522 --> 00:12.656
when the mayor gets his head
out of his ass.

00:12.657 --> 00:13.855
Sorry, wrong cliché.

00:13.859 --> 00:15.057
Oh, cut it out.
And his head's

00:15.060 --> 00:16.393
not out of his ass?

00:16.393 --> 00:17.859
Is it partly out?

00:17.862 --> 00:18.894
Do you have a progress report?

00:18.896 --> 00:20.297
I'll make it simple
for you!

00:20.298 --> 00:23.733
When the mayor asks me to re-up,
himself, in person...

00:23.734 --> 00:24.833
And what's with all
the qualifiers?

00:24.835 --> 00:25.702
That's two qualifiers!

00:25.702 --> 00:27.268
Two!
And the peas cannot touch

00:27.271 --> 00:28.571
the mashed potatoes.

00:28.574 --> 00:29.739
I serve at the pleasure
of the mayor.

00:29.740 --> 00:32.942
All I ask is that he ask me
to re-up!

00:32.945 --> 00:34.677
He's trying to schedule
a signing ceremony.

00:34.679 --> 00:35.679
That's not the same thing.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.380
With you and yours
and the brass

00:37.381 --> 00:39.381
and press in formation.
That is not the same thing!

00:39.383 --> 00:41.549
It's <i> the</i> thing!
Did Mrs. Moore hire the hall

00:41.551 --> 00:44.185
and the caterers <i> before</i>
you asked her to marry you?

00:44.188 --> 00:45.720
It's not the same thing.

00:45.723 --> 00:47.490
Well, it's damn close.
Same principle.

00:48.759 --> 00:52.262
Some requests,

00:52.264 --> 00:54.463
some decisions,

00:54.466 --> 00:58.167
deserve to have
protocol respected.

00:58.170 --> 01:01.570
Deserve to have it honored.

01:01.573 --> 01:02.706
Or what?

01:02.707 --> 01:05.242
Or what? Or what?
What do you mean, "Or what?"

01:05.242 --> 01:07.010
How long you gonna
let this go on?

01:07.012 --> 01:09.045
As long as it takes
the mayor and you

01:09.046 --> 01:10.579
to accept the fact
that I will

01:10.581 --> 01:12.248
only do this one way.

01:12.251 --> 01:12.915
Your way.

01:12.918 --> 01:15.150
The right way.

01:15.152 --> 01:18.587
I serve at the pleasure
of the mayor, and you serve

01:18.590 --> 01:19.823
at the pleasure
of the commissioner.

01:19.825 --> 01:21.156
Am I right?

01:21.158 --> 01:22.224
Yes, sir.

01:22.227 --> 01:23.460
Then act like it.

01:24.495 --> 01:26.028
If you're so eager
to make this happen,

01:26.031 --> 01:29.132
make it happen the way
your boss wants it to happen.

01:33.138 --> 01:35.771
(jazz piano playing)

01:35.774 --> 01:39.408
(laughing)

01:39.411 --> 01:40.676
What's so funny?

01:40.679 --> 01:42.078
Nothing.

01:42.079 --> 01:43.479
It's my frisée salad,
isn't it?

01:43.481 --> 01:44.747
(chuckles)

01:44.750 --> 01:46.549
I look like a giant wimp
right now.

01:46.551 --> 01:48.218
You're picturing me in a dress.

01:48.219 --> 01:50.219
No, no, it's nothing like that.

01:50.222 --> 01:52.289
It's just been a long time
since I've done this

01:52.290 --> 01:56.293
and an even longer time
since I've enjoyed it.

01:56.295 --> 01:57.926
(phone ringing)

01:58.930 --> 02:01.197
(sighs)
Anthony.

02:01.198 --> 02:02.399
Uh-oh.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.266
Who's Anthony?

02:05.037 --> 02:06.736
Sorry. Hello?

02:06.737 --> 02:08.237
Hey, Erin. It's me, Anthony.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.872
Yes, Anthony, I know.

02:09.875 --> 02:12.141
I have caller I.D.,
just like everyone else

02:12.144 --> 02:14.210
in the Western Hemisphere.
(chuckles)

02:14.211 --> 02:15.412
We got a problem.
You should get down here.

02:15.413 --> 02:18.147
I just texted you the address.

02:18.150 --> 02:20.783
You're texting the wrong number.
I'm not catching tonight.

02:20.786 --> 02:22.686
Erin, listen,

02:22.687 --> 02:24.920
trust me,
you need to get down here.

02:24.923 --> 02:26.923
We got a cop shot and killed.

02:27.759 --> 02:29.959
Oh, no. I'm on my way.

02:29.961 --> 02:33.195
Erin, wait. Wait.

02:33.198 --> 02:34.364
I'm really sorry, but...

02:34.365 --> 02:35.698
You're certain
that wasn't just

02:35.700 --> 02:38.901
one of your girlfriends calling
to get you out of here, right?

02:38.903 --> 02:40.804
A police officer's been killed.

02:40.805 --> 02:43.105
I'm sorry.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.783 --> 02:54.683
Excuse me.

02:54.686 --> 02:55.918
Detective Reagan.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.486
Yes.

02:57.489 --> 02:58.722
Sergeant Rutkowski.

02:58.723 --> 03:00.223
I'm here on instructions
from Lieutenant Gormley.

03:00.224 --> 03:01.457
I'm supposed to give you this.

03:02.426 --> 03:05.127
What exactly is
Lieutenant Gormley gifting me?

03:05.129 --> 03:06.596
A missing cop.

03:06.598 --> 03:08.431
Missing how?

03:08.432 --> 03:10.734
Officer Kenneth Nelson
missed roll call

03:10.735 --> 03:11.901
about four hours ago.

03:11.902 --> 03:13.269
DANNY:
And the CO declared him AWOL?

03:13.271 --> 03:14.637
Yeah. That's right.

03:14.639 --> 03:16.139
Okay. Who's this?

03:16.140 --> 03:18.408
Officer Abrams.
I'm Kenny's partner.

03:18.409 --> 03:19.675
Yeah, I brought him along.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.243
Thought you might want
to pick his brain.

03:21.246 --> 03:23.112
So?

03:23.115 --> 03:24.013
Kenny's a good cop.

03:24.014 --> 03:25.281
Have you heard from him?

03:25.283 --> 03:26.316
No, I haven't.

03:26.318 --> 03:27.449
That's not so good.

03:27.451 --> 03:28.518
Kenny's been having
a tough time lately.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.954
I'm not sure
if that has anything to do

03:30.955 --> 03:32.756
with him not showing today,
but...

03:32.757 --> 03:35.424
I wanted to put it out there.
I'm...

03:35.426 --> 03:38.328
not exactly sure what it is
you're putting out there.

03:38.329 --> 03:39.995
Officer Nelson's son
passed away

03:39.997 --> 03:41.396
a couple years back.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.865
Leukemia.
Oh.

03:42.867 --> 03:44.734
Well, I'm sorry.

03:44.735 --> 03:47.336
Kenny's boy was just seven
years old when he lost him.

03:47.338 --> 03:50.372
Needless to say, the guy's
never been the same since.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.040
Okay.

03:52.043 --> 03:53.810
I'll get on it.

03:58.682 --> 04:00.015
I called you back five times!

04:00.018 --> 04:01.784
Every time,
straight to voicemail.

04:01.787 --> 04:04.721
I know. I'm sorry. I was on
the phone with the office,

04:04.723 --> 04:06.122
and then
my cell died in the tunnel.

04:06.123 --> 04:07.257
Where's the body? This way?

04:07.259 --> 04:08.390
Listen, we got to talk.

04:08.393 --> 04:09.692
Yeah, I think I got
everything on the way.

04:09.693 --> 04:10.794
Listen...

04:10.795 --> 04:12.694
Officer Donald Gibson.
12 years on the job.

04:12.697 --> 04:16.199
Was shot approximately 9:17 p.m.
in a drug deal gone bad.

04:16.201 --> 04:18.100
Yeah, but listen...
Where's his partner?

04:18.103 --> 04:20.670
I heard he got a glimpse of
the shooter when he was fleeing.

04:20.672 --> 04:21.805
Yeah, he did.

04:21.807 --> 04:22.939
He-He's right over there.
Great.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.374
Erin, listen...
Let's start there.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.675
Erin! Hang on.

04:26.677 --> 04:28.778
Anthony, I just want
to get the description

04:28.779 --> 04:30.146
while it's fresh in his mind.

04:30.148 --> 04:31.747
We already got the shooter.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.649
What? Well, that's great.

04:33.651 --> 04:35.985
Yeah. The partner put
the description over the air

04:35.987 --> 04:37.353
right after the shooting.

04:37.355 --> 04:39.122
RMP picked him up
about ten minutes ago.

04:39.124 --> 04:40.824
But we have a problem.

04:40.826 --> 04:43.393
The shooter's name
is Adrian Cooke.

04:43.394 --> 04:44.661
Adrian Cooke?

04:44.663 --> 04:45.862
Yes.

04:56.574 --> 04:58.274
Anthony,
what are you telling me?

04:58.276 --> 05:00.877
Nothing.
I-I'm just saying what I said.

05:02.146 --> 05:04.613
You mean to say
I'm responsible for this?

05:40.161 --> 05:44.096
We put Adrian Cooke in the
Manhattan Fresh Start program

05:44.096 --> 05:45.362
instead of prosecuting him

05:45.365 --> 05:47.465
because he was
a nonviolent offender.

05:47.466 --> 05:49.067
And then he goes out

05:49.069 --> 05:51.769
and kills a cop.

05:51.771 --> 05:53.170
But you gave him
that second chance

05:53.173 --> 05:55.105
because you believed
he deserved it.

05:55.108 --> 05:57.141
Doesn't matter what we thought.

05:57.143 --> 06:00.144
We clearly made the wrong
decision in this case.

06:00.146 --> 06:02.680
But because I was the
lead prosecutor on it,

06:02.682 --> 06:06.149
I'm gonna be the face
of that decision.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.754
Oh, my gosh.

06:09.755 --> 06:11.788
(reporters clamoring)

06:16.028 --> 06:18.096
What do we do?

06:18.098 --> 06:19.329
It's okay. Keep calm. Keep calm.

06:19.331 --> 06:20.464
(horn honking)

06:20.466 --> 06:22.667
(clamoring continues)

06:28.408 --> 06:29.507
Mom, go!

06:29.509 --> 06:30.807
Go!

06:38.817 --> 06:40.384
(knocking)

06:42.922 --> 06:45.088
(sighs)

06:46.558 --> 06:47.725
Good morning,
Mrs. Nelson.

06:47.726 --> 06:49.927
Detective Reagan.
Detective Baez.

06:49.928 --> 06:52.028
What can I do for you?
Well, we've been

06:52.031 --> 06:54.132
calling all morning.
No answer.

06:54.134 --> 06:55.165
Okay.

06:55.168 --> 06:56.100
Your husband, he didn't show up

06:56.101 --> 06:57.067
for work last night.

06:57.069 --> 06:58.935
So we were hoping
to have a word.

06:58.937 --> 07:00.071
Be my guest.

07:00.072 --> 07:02.206
May we come in?

07:02.208 --> 07:03.540
This is my house.
You want to talk to Kenny,

07:03.543 --> 07:04.541
you go to his house.

07:04.543 --> 07:05.642
His house?

07:05.644 --> 07:07.644
We're separated six months.

07:07.646 --> 07:09.947
Well, we hadn't heard that.
Yeah, well, I guess

07:09.949 --> 07:11.281
you don't watch
<i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

07:11.283 --> 07:12.649
It was a big deal.

07:12.651 --> 07:13.550
That's funny.

07:13.552 --> 07:15.252
Can you give us
his new address?

07:15.254 --> 07:16.521
No.
Well,

07:16.523 --> 07:17.954
you know,
your husband never updated

07:17.956 --> 07:20.024
his contact information
with the NYPD.

07:20.026 --> 07:21.324
Interesting.

07:21.326 --> 07:23.194
You have any other
thrilling anecdotes like that?

07:23.196 --> 07:24.928
I'll pull up a chair.
Maybe you

07:24.930 --> 07:27.264
don't understand the seriousness
of the situation.

07:27.266 --> 07:29.901
Your husband went AWOL
from the NYPD.

07:29.903 --> 07:31.235
If he misses much more,

07:31.237 --> 07:33.603
he's gonna lose the job
and the pension.

07:34.441 --> 07:36.040
First of all,

07:36.042 --> 07:38.308
he <i> was</i> my husband.

07:38.310 --> 07:40.745
And second, please,
the guy's got bigger problems

07:40.747 --> 07:42.012
than you two.

07:42.014 --> 07:43.548
Really? Like what?

07:43.550 --> 07:44.848
You're the big-shot detectives.

07:44.850 --> 07:46.884
Start detecting.

07:47.420 --> 07:48.853
Come on.

07:48.855 --> 07:50.187
Can't you help us out?

07:51.191 --> 07:52.189
You have a warrant?

07:52.192 --> 07:53.691
No, we don't have a warrant.

07:53.692 --> 07:55.893
Then have a nice day.

07:58.331 --> 08:00.430
(both sigh)

08:00.432 --> 08:02.533
What the hell
was that all about?

08:02.535 --> 08:04.569
I don't know.

08:29.795 --> 08:31.829
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Frank.

08:31.831 --> 08:34.565
It's what we do, you and I.

08:34.567 --> 08:37.301
And thanks for coming up.
I know this is long overdue.

08:37.302 --> 08:40.705
And it's going to have
to stay that way, for now.

08:40.706 --> 08:42.072
What is?

08:42.075 --> 08:44.841
The question of whether
I stay on or not.

08:45.711 --> 08:48.678
Frank, we both have
packed schedules.

08:48.681 --> 08:50.248
Your office specifically
asked me...

08:50.250 --> 08:51.982
I have not heard one word

08:51.985 --> 08:53.417
from this office

08:53.418 --> 08:55.318
about the travesty that led up

08:55.321 --> 08:57.087
to Officer Gibson's murder.

08:57.090 --> 08:59.990
I released a statement
the moment I heard.

08:59.993 --> 09:01.792
About my officer, yes.

09:01.793 --> 09:04.861
I'm talking
about your Fresh Start program.

09:04.864 --> 09:06.264
<i>Our</i> Fresh Start program, Frank.

09:06.265 --> 09:07.798
We're all
on the same team together.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.701
Well, the team bus left
without me on that one.

09:10.702 --> 09:13.437
Look, I'm sorry ADA Reagan
is taking the heat,

09:13.438 --> 09:15.273
but I know
she can take it.

09:15.274 --> 09:16.974
Take it for you.

09:16.975 --> 09:18.408
So that's
what this is all about?

09:18.411 --> 09:20.110
You think I hung Erin
out to dry?

09:20.113 --> 09:21.412
Oh, come on, Mr. Mayor.

09:21.413 --> 09:22.679
You know me better than that.

09:22.682 --> 09:23.748
This isn't about Erin.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.582
She just drew the short straw.

09:25.585 --> 09:28.219
I told you from day one

09:28.221 --> 09:30.855
that this program
was fundamentally flawed.

09:30.856 --> 09:33.256
And I thanked you
for your unsolicited input

09:33.259 --> 09:34.625
and implemented the program.

09:34.626 --> 09:37.928
To spectacular results.

09:38.764 --> 09:40.498
Look, Frank,

09:40.500 --> 09:44.268
I am deeply sorry
that we lost Officer Gibson.

09:44.269 --> 09:47.538
And I feel terrible that one
of our Fresh Start pilot cases

09:47.539 --> 09:50.006
appears to be responsible,
but that doesn't negate the good

09:50.009 --> 09:51.042
that this program can do.

09:51.043 --> 09:52.143
I got a dead

09:52.144 --> 09:53.443
police officer, Carter.

09:53.446 --> 09:54.912
Don't talk to me about good.

09:54.913 --> 09:57.782
And don't isolate a tragedy
to make a blanket case.

09:57.783 --> 09:59.584
Look, I'll make
a joint statement

09:59.586 --> 10:01.885
with the acting DA
before the evening news cycle.

10:01.888 --> 10:03.955
Plenty of time
to practice your furrowed brow

10:03.956 --> 10:05.556
and solemn rhetoric.

10:05.557 --> 10:07.658
Frank, you're out of line.

10:07.659 --> 10:09.360
You're right. I am.

10:09.361 --> 10:11.227
Out of line, behind the times,

10:11.230 --> 10:14.398
fresh out of patience
for Fresh Start and its ilk.

10:14.399 --> 10:16.600
And its ilk? What,
do you have some kind of list?

10:16.602 --> 10:18.602
You really want to know?
No.

10:18.605 --> 10:19.669
Where do you want me to start?

10:19.672 --> 10:20.671
I think you've already started.

10:20.673 --> 10:22.840
A homeless program
that produces nothing

10:22.841 --> 10:25.576
but statistics
and leaves it to the police

10:25.577 --> 10:26.811
to play the villain...

10:26.812 --> 10:29.080
Commissioner, that's enough.

10:30.383 --> 10:33.116
Yes, sir.

10:34.453 --> 10:38.923
Now, Frank, do you remember
why I invited you up here?

10:38.924 --> 10:40.991
You know,

10:40.994 --> 10:42.927
I don't.

10:42.928 --> 10:46.062
I forgot.

10:51.903 --> 10:54.304
A couple years back,
a guy, Nelson,

10:54.307 --> 10:56.506
he worked out of your house.
You guys know him?

10:56.509 --> 10:58.408
Yeah, a little.
Good guy, good cop.

10:58.411 --> 10:59.876
Now he's an AWOL cop.

10:59.879 --> 11:01.077
Really? What happened?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.245
I don't know.

11:02.248 --> 11:03.547
His partner hasn't heard
from him.

11:03.548 --> 11:04.981
His soon-to-be ex-wife

11:04.984 --> 11:06.783
doesn't give a damn
if he's dead or alive.

11:06.785 --> 11:09.052
Anything you can remember about
him that might shed some light?

11:09.054 --> 11:11.589
He was only with us
for a cup of coffee.

11:11.591 --> 11:13.289
And that was before
he lost his son.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.125
Yeah, well, he's got
plenty of rips since then--

11:15.128 --> 11:16.293
reporting late for duty,

11:16.294 --> 11:18.796
improper patrol,
civilian complaints.

11:18.798 --> 11:21.599
Well, I can't say for sure,
but I did hear some rumors.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.899
What kind of rumors?

11:22.902 --> 11:24.368
Nothing I ever
saw myself,

11:24.370 --> 11:26.770
but I-I heard Kenny
was messing with drugs.

11:26.773 --> 11:30.674
His partner never said a word
to me about him using drugs.

11:30.677 --> 11:32.308
He would've known.

11:32.311 --> 11:34.211
Yeah, if he was hitting the pipe
and we were riding together

11:34.212 --> 11:35.645
every day
and I didn't notice,

11:35.648 --> 11:37.313
I wouldn't deserve
to wear the uniform.

11:37.316 --> 11:39.417
That's what I'm thinking.

11:41.019 --> 11:42.720
(sighs)

11:44.856 --> 11:48.292
This is Cooke running north
along First Avenue towards 195

11:48.293 --> 11:50.894
just before
he's snatched up by NYPD.

11:50.897 --> 11:52.562
See there,

11:52.565 --> 11:54.365
he's got the gun.

11:54.366 --> 11:56.900
We lose him for a sec,

11:56.903 --> 11:58.735
pick him up the next block.

12:01.274 --> 12:02.639
But here,

12:02.642 --> 12:03.774
there's no gun.

12:03.775 --> 12:05.643
So somewhere between
here and there

12:05.644 --> 12:08.479
Cooke ditches it.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.413
NYPD searching
that block already?

12:10.416 --> 12:11.749
Every inch of it.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.417
Investigating detectives
need anything--

12:13.418 --> 12:14.784
and I mean anything--

12:14.787 --> 12:16.086
you let me know.

12:16.088 --> 12:17.421
10-4.

12:18.457 --> 12:20.791
And get a word out to our
friends in Corrections.

12:20.793 --> 12:22.493
So long as Adrian Cooke
is in the custody

12:22.495 --> 12:25.462
of this city, he is to be
treated like the Pope himself.

12:25.465 --> 12:26.697
Guy's a cop killer.

12:26.698 --> 12:28.698
You know what they do
to those guys in the joint.

12:28.701 --> 12:30.835
Which is why I want you
to make sure it doesn't happen.

12:30.836 --> 12:33.269
I am not gonna lose this case
on a trumped-up appeal

12:33.272 --> 12:36.440
because some son of a bitch
guard took a cheap shot.

12:36.442 --> 12:39.275
Copy you. And, look,
for what it's worth...

12:39.278 --> 12:41.879
Sorry to interrupt, but,
uh, Officer Gibson's widow

12:41.880 --> 12:44.148
is here and asked
to speak with you.

12:46.119 --> 12:47.851
I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:48.888 --> 12:50.721
Tell her you're tied up?

12:50.722 --> 12:52.990
Where is she?

13:14.246 --> 13:16.447
Mrs. Gibson.

13:21.854 --> 13:23.988
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:27.826 --> 13:29.293
You're Erin Reagan?

13:29.294 --> 13:31.427
I am.

13:31.429 --> 13:34.331
If you'd like to go
to my office so we could talk...

13:36.635 --> 13:39.269
No, that's okay.

13:39.272 --> 13:51.948
Are you sure?

13:51.951 --> 13:53.384
(sighs)

14:02.336 --> 14:04.202
And then what happened?

14:04.698 --> 14:07.500
And then she hauled off
and slapped me.

14:07.501 --> 14:08.600
Hard.

14:08.602 --> 14:10.568
Still hurt?

14:10.571 --> 14:12.370
Not so much on my face.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.105
But on the inside, yeah.

14:14.107 --> 14:15.640
You want to press charges?

14:15.643 --> 14:17.610
No, of course not.

14:18.947 --> 14:21.313
You didn't come
all the way over here

14:21.316 --> 14:23.182
to tell me
someone slapped you.

14:23.183 --> 14:25.017
I came all the way over here

14:25.019 --> 14:27.552
to ask you in person
to try not to intercede

14:27.554 --> 14:28.854
with the mayor on this.

14:28.855 --> 14:30.489
I already tried to intercede

14:30.490 --> 14:32.390
before the damn program
got rolled out.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.293
Good, then you're on record.

14:34.294 --> 14:35.827
Stay out of the current mess.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.797
What makes you think I'd try?

14:37.798 --> 14:40.332
40 years of knowing you.

14:40.335 --> 14:42.268
And by the way, I would still

14:42.269 --> 14:45.203
back the mayor on this program
if I had to do it over.

14:48.009 --> 14:50.710
I don't know how
you can still be for it.

14:50.711 --> 14:53.346
A cop was murdered
on account of this thug

14:53.347 --> 14:55.114
getting a fresh start.

14:55.115 --> 14:57.917
How many innocent men got
roughed up by stop and frisk?

14:57.918 --> 14:59.150
Roughed up isn't dead.

14:59.153 --> 15:01.953
The greater good
trumps a single setback.

15:01.956 --> 15:03.855
Maybe we should quit here
while we're ahead here.

15:03.857 --> 15:06.491
I was quoting you there,
Dad, on the greater good.

15:06.494 --> 15:08.027
Well, in this case, misquoting.

15:08.028 --> 15:09.195
It presumes
the mayor's program...

15:09.197 --> 15:11.129
One I support.

15:11.131 --> 15:14.799
...that your and the mayor's
program serves the greater good.

15:14.802 --> 15:17.802
But there's a fact
that proves you wrong.

15:17.804 --> 15:21.907
And it's plain as day laying
on a slab down in the morgue.

15:25.413 --> 15:27.645
Hey, Danny.

15:27.648 --> 15:30.015
Officer Abrams,
congratulations,

15:30.018 --> 15:32.485
you won yourself a first-class
ticket to my doghouse.

15:32.486 --> 15:34.120
What's going on?
Move it.

15:34.121 --> 15:35.520
That's an excellent
question.

15:35.523 --> 15:39.357
One I look forward to prying
out of you like a rotten tooth.

15:41.696 --> 15:44.897
"I am not a bad person.

15:44.899 --> 15:47.099
"But I have done bad things.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.501
"By the time I'm six,
I'm on my own,

15:49.504 --> 15:51.470
"either in the streets
or in the system.

15:51.471 --> 15:53.706
"So yeah, I done stuff,

15:53.707 --> 15:56.975
"but I ain't never hurt no one,
not really.

15:56.977 --> 15:59.845
"I want to be good and if
you give me this chance

15:59.846 --> 16:01.312
"I will do whatever it takes

16:01.315 --> 16:05.017
"to be the best me I can be.

16:05.019 --> 16:06.985
"Thank you for your time.

16:06.988 --> 16:08.553
Adrian."

16:08.556 --> 16:12.024
That's a very moving letter.

16:12.025 --> 16:15.061
Unfortunately
it's complete fiction.

16:15.062 --> 16:16.128
Nah, it ain't.

16:16.129 --> 16:17.062
It's good,
don't get me wrong.

16:17.065 --> 16:18.697
Good enough to convince me

16:18.698 --> 16:20.799
and the rest
of the review board.

16:20.802 --> 16:22.534
But it's still a con job.

16:22.537 --> 16:23.936
That's all true.

16:23.937 --> 16:25.004
Every word of it.

16:25.005 --> 16:26.337
"I ain't ever hurt no one,

16:26.340 --> 16:27.907
not really?"

16:27.908 --> 16:29.307
Yeah, I didn't.

16:29.309 --> 16:31.943
I think Officer Gibson
might disagree if he could.

16:31.946 --> 16:34.312
Unfortunately, we will never
hear from him again.

16:34.315 --> 16:35.681
I ain't kill that cop, aiight?

16:35.682 --> 16:37.482
His partner ID'd you as the man

16:37.485 --> 16:40.119
fleeing the scene
with a gun in his hand.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.187
And he's wrong.

16:41.188 --> 16:43.456
Dead wrong.
And yet when the cops caught you

16:43.457 --> 16:44.956
you were running.

16:44.959 --> 16:48.427
Moments after the shooting
a few blocks away.

16:48.428 --> 16:49.595
Why?

16:49.596 --> 16:50.796
I was jogging.

16:50.798 --> 16:52.998
Jogging.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.701
In jeans,
a hoodie and work boots.

16:55.702 --> 16:57.102
Okay, fine.

16:57.105 --> 16:59.071
I wasn't jogging.

17:00.841 --> 17:02.475
But I didn't
kill that cop either.

17:02.476 --> 17:04.710
(door opens) Why were you running
from the scene?

17:08.615 --> 17:12.117
I don't know.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.685
Just because.

17:13.688 --> 17:15.587
Good luck with that.
You better hope

17:15.589 --> 17:17.789
the jury's made up
of five-year-olds.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.460
Excuse me.

17:26.267 --> 17:28.299
Merry Christmas.

17:30.137 --> 17:32.171
I want Harbor Patrol

17:32.173 --> 17:34.173
in that river,
like, 15 minutes ago.

17:34.174 --> 17:35.974
I'm on it.

17:42.282 --> 17:43.982
This is you

17:43.984 --> 17:46.152
with the gun.

17:47.188 --> 17:49.387
And when the cops
pull it out of the river

17:49.390 --> 17:50.955
you're going up the river.

18:00.934 --> 18:03.935
Listen, I haven't
done anything wrong.

18:03.938 --> 18:05.237
All I know

18:05.239 --> 18:07.705
is he didn't show up
for work last night.

18:07.708 --> 18:10.276
Come on. Your partner's
got a drug problem

18:10.278 --> 18:12.290
and you're gonna color
in the details for us right now.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.000
Should I have my PBA rep
in here with me?

18:14.001 --> 18:16.383
You know what,
that's a brilliant idea.

18:16.384 --> 18:18.116
Why don't you
call your PBA rep

18:18.118 --> 18:20.085
and I'll call the
chief of department

18:20.086 --> 18:21.252
and we can order in pizza

18:21.255 --> 18:22.721
and make a day of it,
how's that sound?

18:22.722 --> 18:24.256
No.

18:24.258 --> 18:25.691
Then cut the crap.

18:25.692 --> 18:27.926
All right, all right.
Forget I mentioned it.

18:27.929 --> 18:31.763
You know where your partner is,
don't you, Officer Abrams?

18:31.766 --> 18:33.097
I do not.

18:33.099 --> 18:34.232
You're lying.

18:34.234 --> 18:35.300
No, I'm not.

18:35.302 --> 18:36.734
Yes, you are.

18:38.873 --> 18:40.405
We dumped your partner's phone.

18:40.407 --> 18:42.641
The two of you chirped
for 18 minutes

18:42.643 --> 18:45.243
about an hour before
he was to start his tour.

18:49.383 --> 18:51.317
Still don't know anything?

18:52.353 --> 18:53.786
How jammed up am I?

18:53.788 --> 18:56.521
A lot less
once you start helping.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.358
I know you guys
got a job to do here

19:00.361 --> 19:02.294
and I respect that.

19:02.296 --> 19:04.395
But I'm all
Kenny's got right now.

19:04.397 --> 19:05.663
Well, the longer

19:05.665 --> 19:08.133
this drags out,
the worse it gets for Kenny.

19:08.134 --> 19:10.501
So if you really
want to help him,

19:10.503 --> 19:12.371
you're gonna help us.

19:17.678 --> 19:20.346
I told him I'd cover for him

19:20.347 --> 19:21.747
for a few hours.

19:21.749 --> 19:24.849
Enough time for him
to check himself into rehab.

19:24.852 --> 19:26.451
Because if he makes it to rehab

19:26.453 --> 19:29.320
the NYPD can't get
their hands on him for 30 days.

19:29.323 --> 19:31.824
Which means no drug test.

19:31.826 --> 19:35.193
And he comes out sober
and gets to keep his job.

19:38.898 --> 19:42.067
(sighs)

19:45.272 --> 19:47.038
I'm thinking after
this whole thing is over,

19:47.040 --> 19:50.009
maybe we should
go after Abrams.

19:50.010 --> 19:51.442
The guy interfered

19:51.444 --> 19:53.578
with a police investigation,
after all.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.079
Yeah?

19:55.082 --> 19:56.214
Yeah.

19:56.217 --> 19:57.915
'Cause I might
want to give him a hug.

19:58.885 --> 20:00.952
What?
He was protecting

20:00.954 --> 20:02.621
his partner--
I respect that.

20:02.623 --> 20:06.258
Some partner. The guy's using
while wearing the uniform.

20:06.259 --> 20:07.625
He's a disgrace.
You forget the part

20:07.627 --> 20:10.962
already where he lost his
seven-year-old kid to cancer?

20:10.964 --> 20:13.731
No, I didn't forget that, okay?
And it's a tragedy, no doubt.

20:13.733 --> 20:15.601
Still no excuse

20:15.603 --> 20:18.002
to go doping
while you're on the job.

20:18.005 --> 20:20.972
You know one in every
ten people in this country

20:20.974 --> 20:22.340
is suffering with addiction?

20:22.343 --> 20:25.943
Look, I understand that this
is a delicate subject for you,

20:25.945 --> 20:27.913
given your
family's history

20:27.914 --> 20:29.548
with your brother and drugs.

20:29.549 --> 20:31.282
Danny, how many people
do you have sitting around

20:31.285 --> 20:33.085
that Reagan family
dinner table, huh?

20:33.086 --> 20:34.252
I'm guessing

20:34.255 --> 20:35.586
close to ten, right?

20:35.588 --> 20:37.388
Are you trying
to say something here?

20:37.391 --> 20:39.625
This is a problem for all of us

20:39.626 --> 20:41.326
and one day
it may even come home

20:41.328 --> 20:43.162
to roost
under your very own roof.

20:43.163 --> 20:44.730
That is never going to happen.

20:44.731 --> 20:46.464
Well, I sincerely
hope not.

20:46.467 --> 20:50.134
But that's exactly what everyone
else says just before it does.

20:51.404 --> 20:53.172
Look, I'm just saying.

20:53.173 --> 20:55.007
Maybe bring it down a notch

20:55.009 --> 20:57.276
and show a fellow cop
a little love.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.579
A little love, huh?

21:01.582 --> 21:03.115
Yeah.
Hm.

21:03.116 --> 21:05.250
Goes a long way, partner.

21:10.523 --> 21:12.357
Today is no different.
I'm not gonna hide

21:12.359 --> 21:14.159
and I'm not gonna
let them see me sweat.

21:14.161 --> 21:15.527
MAN: There she is!
Oh, crap.

21:15.528 --> 21:16.894
WOMAN:
Here she comes.

21:16.896 --> 21:18.630
Told you you should've
used the back door.

21:18.632 --> 21:20.798
(all clamoring)

21:20.800 --> 21:22.567
Reagan, can we
get a statement?

21:22.569 --> 21:24.303
Can you comment on the case?

21:24.305 --> 21:26.505
(clamoring continues)

21:28.642 --> 21:30.642
MAN:
Can we get a statement?

21:30.644 --> 21:32.544
OFFICER:
All right, step back.

21:32.546 --> 21:34.445
Oh, my God,
enough is enough.

21:34.448 --> 21:35.780
ABETEMARCO:
There you are.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.449
Erin.

21:37.451 --> 21:39.151
Harbor patrol's
scuba team

21:39.153 --> 21:40.618
caught a big one.

21:40.621 --> 21:42.653
They pulled Cooke's gun
out of the river.

21:42.655 --> 21:44.155
You're kidding, that's great.

21:44.157 --> 21:46.924
Yeah, but it ain't the gun
that killed Officer Gibson.

21:46.926 --> 21:48.460
What?

21:48.461 --> 21:50.261
Looks like
you're off the hook, kid.

21:50.263 --> 21:52.897
Then who <i> did</i> kill him?

22:09.425 --> 22:11.364
You got to make sense
of this for me,

22:11.365 --> 22:12.864
because I'm a little lost.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.231
I'm right there with you.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.167
It don't make no sense.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.469
Really, Anthony?

22:17.471 --> 22:19.371
If it don't make no sense,
then it makes sense.

22:19.373 --> 22:21.173
Right?
What are you talking about?

22:21.174 --> 22:23.107
Never mind.

22:23.109 --> 22:26.111
Maybe the NYPD diver pulled
the wrong nine millimeter out.

22:26.113 --> 22:28.445
I mean, there's got
to be hundreds of guns

22:28.448 --> 22:29.881
on the bottom of that river.

22:29.883 --> 22:31.048
It's Cooke's gun.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.317
His prints survived
the drink and everything.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.923
You mean
he's telling the truth?

22:37.924 --> 22:39.657
Cooke's not our shooter?

22:39.660 --> 22:41.192
Which is good for you.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.794
And it makes sense.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.497
Everything we know of him so far
is non-violent drug offenses.

22:45.499 --> 22:47.932
For him to go from that
to popping a cop--

22:47.934 --> 22:49.267
that's a pretty big leap.

22:49.269 --> 22:51.869
Let's not mistake this guy
for Mahatma Gandhi just yet.

22:51.872 --> 22:54.905
I mean, we do have video
of him running with a gun.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.641
That's a good point.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.509
What was he using that for?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.644
To make war, not peace.

23:00.646 --> 23:04.115
Coordinate with
the investigating detectives,

23:04.116 --> 23:06.785
get a list of all
the reported crimes in the area

23:06.787 --> 23:08.452
around the time
that Officer Gibson was killed.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.654
Got it.

23:11.525 --> 23:13.692
(sighs)

23:15.061 --> 23:17.596
DANNY:
<i>All I want to know is if</i>

23:17.597 --> 23:19.297
Kenneth Nelson
checked in today.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.499
I am sorry, Detective,
but I'm not at liberty

23:21.500 --> 23:23.634
to tell you
if Mr. Nelson is a patient.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.703
We don't want
to speak to him, okay?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.605
We just need to confirm
that he's here.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.707
We'll be on our merry way.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.307
I understand,
but I cannot help you.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.809
Just look in your little book

23:31.811 --> 23:33.845
and see if you can find the name
"Nelson" please.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.080
I'm sorry, Detective.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.983
If you want us to come back
with a warrant, we will.

23:38.986 --> 23:40.618
The courts have held up
time and time again

23:40.621 --> 23:42.621
that our records fall under
doctor-patient confidentiality.

23:42.623 --> 23:45.022
There is no judge
in this country

23:45.025 --> 23:46.790
who would give you
the warrant you desire.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.693
(sighs)

23:49.695 --> 23:51.695
Would you talk to her, please?

23:51.698 --> 23:53.897
Sure.

23:55.269 --> 23:56.934
I'd like to personally thank you

23:56.936 --> 23:59.336
for all the work
you and your staff do here.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.971
I think you're
miracle workers.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.307
So, thank you

24:02.308 --> 24:04.342
for your time.

24:04.344 --> 24:06.944
Well, thank you.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.749
That's it?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.950
Hey!

24:13.353 --> 24:16.186
I meant for you to talk
some sense into her,

24:16.189 --> 24:17.622
not kiss her ass.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.990
I know what you meant,

24:18.991 --> 24:20.858
because she's right,
and you're wrong.

24:20.861 --> 24:21.925
Oh, and because
Nelson isn't here.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.327
How do you know?

24:23.329 --> 24:25.797
Because I had a nice little chat
with a nurse in the ladies room

24:25.798 --> 24:27.499
who told me
no one checked in today.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.366
Great. Then where
the hell is he?

24:29.368 --> 24:31.086
(sighs) Well, I know where
my brother would be.

24:31.087 --> 24:33.638
Where?
Copping dope.

24:36.643 --> 24:40.311
The investigating detectives on
the case gave us an accounting

24:40.314 --> 24:42.547
of every crime committed
in this precinct

24:42.548 --> 24:44.348
the night that Gibson
was gunned down.

24:44.351 --> 24:47.018
About two minutes before
that call went over the air,

24:47.019 --> 24:50.087
911 received a call
about a robbery in progress

24:50.089 --> 24:51.388
at this location.

24:51.391 --> 24:52.990
You think it was Cooke?

24:52.992 --> 24:56.094
Let's go to the videotape.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.230
How you doing, pal?

24:59.231 --> 25:00.632
Hey.

25:00.634 --> 25:02.267
Yeah, roll the tape.

25:02.269 --> 25:03.902
Okay.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.575
That's him.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.346
And that's the time
of the shooting.

25:18.151 --> 25:19.750
How far are we
from the crime scene?

25:19.752 --> 25:21.086
Five blocks south.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.288
Well, Cooke is definitely
not our shooter, and it explains

25:23.289 --> 25:25.557
why he was running
like a bat out of hell

25:25.558 --> 25:26.891
when the cops scooped him up.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.960
And why he refused to tell you
what he was up to.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.862
Good work, Anthony.

25:30.864 --> 25:33.431
Yeah, congratulations to me.

25:33.432 --> 25:36.667
I just cleared
NYPD's only suspect.

25:36.670 --> 25:39.002
Now what the hell do we do?

25:39.839 --> 25:42.039
Our homework.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.482
(knocking)

25:52.352 --> 25:54.219
Garrett's here, sir.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.253
You got the news?

25:56.256 --> 25:57.288
I got the news.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.923
So Adrian Cooke gets
a fresh start

25:58.924 --> 26:00.825
to commit armed robbery instead.

26:00.826 --> 26:01.992
Fair point,

26:01.994 --> 26:04.496
but it's kind of a win-win.

26:04.498 --> 26:06.431
The mayor's program's
off the hook,

26:06.432 --> 26:08.633
Erin's no longer
the worst person in the world,

26:08.634 --> 26:11.068
and your reservations about
Fresh Start have been born out.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.671
So, actually,
it's a win-win-win.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.773
Making it the perfect
opportunity to take a mulligan

26:15.776 --> 26:17.976
on letting the mayor ask you
to stay on.

26:17.978 --> 26:20.944
Well...

26:20.946 --> 26:23.781
I'm not sure
the invitation still stands.

26:23.784 --> 26:24.915
It does.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.451
It didn't go well.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.819
So I heard.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.020
What, you had your ear
pressed to the door?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.021
By his account.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.156
Mayor Poole's.

26:32.159 --> 26:33.391
You shut it down.

26:33.393 --> 26:35.859
So why would
the invitation still stand?

26:37.564 --> 26:39.029
That's hope talking.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.499
(sighs)

26:41.500 --> 26:43.601
My counterpart
in the mayor's office

26:43.603 --> 26:45.470
is having this very
same conversation

26:45.471 --> 26:47.505
with Poole right now.

26:47.507 --> 26:49.307
So we're both being handled.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.375
No one would be foolish enough
to try to handle you.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.576
Least of all, me.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.711
Then what are you doing?

26:53.712 --> 26:55.413
The same thing I always do.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.615
Play the speed bag
till your arms get tired

26:57.616 --> 26:59.150
and you come to your senses.

26:59.152 --> 27:01.419
(sighs)

27:01.421 --> 27:04.655
Do you know how many candidates
he's already met with, Garrett?

27:04.657 --> 27:06.490
No.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.826
I figure seven or eight.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.160
I mean, four of 'em called me.

27:09.162 --> 27:10.795
I just multiply that
by about two.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.698
I'm not going down that road,
and neither should you.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.731
It's human nature.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.166
Weaker side of.

27:16.169 --> 27:17.701
I'd like to schedule

27:17.703 --> 27:19.636
a follow-up visit
for you and the mayor.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.075
I think you're gonna
be disappointed, Garrett.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.810
You know how you always talk
about the greater good?

27:26.813 --> 27:29.314
Well, there's no
place out there

27:29.316 --> 27:32.016
where you can do greater good
than you can from in here.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.986
I used to think that, too.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.859
Okay, so what do we know?

27:41.862 --> 27:44.828
Gibson's partner says
he saw a man in a hoodie

27:44.830 --> 27:46.396
fleeing the scene with a gun.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.432
Yeah, but the only
surveillance footage

27:48.434 --> 27:50.201
we have is of Adrian Cooke,

27:50.202 --> 27:51.869
and we know he's not our guy.

27:51.872 --> 27:53.203
Right.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.906
So, who's our guy, and how
the hell did he disappear?

27:55.909 --> 27:57.674
A cab?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.377
Ah, even all six feet of you
would have a hard time hailing

28:00.380 --> 28:02.513
a cab in that neighborhood.
Subway?

28:02.516 --> 28:05.383
NYPD pulled all the surveillance
from the nearest station.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.584
Bubkus.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.954
Okay, let's say
you just killed a cop.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.490
What would you do next?

28:12.491 --> 28:14.259
I would never do
something like that.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.661
I know that, Anthony.
It's a hypothetical.

28:16.663 --> 28:18.863
Well, I don't care what it is.
I wouldn't do it.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.397
We're just pretending here.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.000
Just make believe for a second
that you killed a cop.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.868
What would you would do
right after?

28:24.871 --> 28:26.538
Turn myself in.

28:26.539 --> 28:30.240
Wow. You don't have an abstract
bone in your body, do you?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.644
Yeah, well, bones
aren't abstract, Erin.

28:32.645 --> 28:34.144
No, they're not.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.248
You know what I would do
if I just killed a cop?

28:37.250 --> 28:39.651
I'd get the first ride
out of there I could,

28:39.653 --> 28:42.386
and if I couldn't, I'd take one.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.154
You mean steal a car?

28:44.156 --> 28:45.355
If I had to.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.825
Yeah, you wouldn't
have the balls.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.260
I would grow a pair real fast
if I just killed a cop,

28:50.262 --> 28:51.663
'cause there's no way
I'd be doing life.

28:51.664 --> 28:53.444
Oh, so you know how
to hot-wire a car?

28:53.469 --> 28:54.299
Maybe.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.602
I also have a gun,
so I could carjack someone.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.808
Wait a second.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.711
Wait a second.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.650
Now, look at this.

29:12.652 --> 29:15.286
Ten minutes after the shooting,

29:15.288 --> 29:16.954
right, in the next
precinct over,

29:16.957 --> 29:18.722
they had a carjack.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.991
It's like 30 blocks away.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.794
Could you cover that much
distance in ten minutes

29:22.796 --> 29:24.162
if you were running full tilt?

29:26.066 --> 29:28.432
I mean, not you, som...

29:29.536 --> 29:33.070
We need to find
who jacked that car.

29:36.142 --> 29:39.576
All right. I'm coming.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.619
BAEZ: This is where
I found my brother once.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.794
See anyone that
looks like him?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.229
State these guys are in,

29:58.230 --> 30:00.798
I don't think
I'd recognize him anyway.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.567
(groaning)

30:02.568 --> 30:04.268
DANNY:
What are you running for?

30:05.137 --> 30:07.904
Nobody has to run, okay?

30:07.906 --> 30:10.407
We're just social workers.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.381
(coughs)

30:22.321 --> 30:24.922
Wake up.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.257
Get out of here!

30:26.259 --> 30:29.394
Go on, get out of here.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.729
DANNY:
Hey, you.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.964
You.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.732
Look at the picture.
You seen him?

30:36.802 --> 30:38.201
Huh?

30:38.203 --> 30:39.436
Come on, take a look.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.342
Hey, Danny?

30:44.344 --> 30:46.644
Yeah.
I think this is Nelson.

30:51.384 --> 30:54.352
And Bingo was
his name-o.

30:54.354 --> 30:57.020
Let's call it in.

31:01.461 --> 31:03.227
What are you doing?
(sighs)

31:03.229 --> 31:04.327
Come on, I don't like
the look in your eyes.

31:04.329 --> 31:05.395
Would you just call it in?

31:05.397 --> 31:06.396
Well, what if we
didn't call it in?

31:06.398 --> 31:08.266
I mean, what if we swoop him up

31:08.268 --> 31:09.534
and take him
to that rehab facility?

31:09.536 --> 31:11.669
We can't do that, okay?
Why not?

31:11.671 --> 31:13.538
Because we'll get
jammed up, all right?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.539
Just call it in.
No, we won't.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.174
Nobody will ever know,
and if we don't,

31:17.176 --> 31:19.309
he's gonna lose his job
and his pension.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.045
Look at him.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.382
He lost his job
a long time ago.

31:24.384 --> 31:25.982
Because his life fell apart.

31:25.984 --> 31:28.452
We can help him put the pieces
back together.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.686
Is this about him,
or your brother?

31:29.689 --> 31:30.954
You don't have to remind me

31:30.957 --> 31:33.090
that my brother
is not coming back, okay?

31:33.093 --> 31:34.892
I live with that every day.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.861
Okay, just call it in.

31:36.863 --> 31:40.964
No, you're gonna have
to make that call.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.246
(sighs)

31:55.248 --> 31:57.714
5-4 detective to Central K.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.387
(sighs)

32:07.961 --> 32:09.192
I got something.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.795
What, are you lurking outside
the ladies room now?

32:10.797 --> 32:12.462
What is this?

32:12.464 --> 32:13.897
Hey, just read it.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.599
"Kendrick Morrow?"

32:15.602 --> 32:17.468
He's got a list
of priors longer

32:17.470 --> 32:18.903
than my mother's
Thanksgiving grocery list.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.371
Armed robbery,

32:20.373 --> 32:22.640
grand larceny,
attempt murder, murder.

32:22.642 --> 32:25.108
And every one,
he uses a Glock nine millimeter.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.612
So does every other
criminal in Manhattan.

32:27.614 --> 32:30.347
Yeah, but ballistics
ran the shell casings

32:30.349 --> 32:32.517
from the Gibson shooting
through IBS,

32:32.519 --> 32:34.352
and they match those
from a robbery

32:34.354 --> 32:36.520
that Morrow was collared on
two years ago.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.823
The key witness pulled out
at the last minute

32:38.825 --> 32:41.526
so the case never went to trial,
and Morrow was cut loose.

32:41.528 --> 32:43.994
Okay, now you've got
my attention.

32:43.997 --> 32:45.328
Good.

32:45.330 --> 32:46.763
You're gonna want it for this.

32:47.834 --> 32:50.734
Is that Morrow running
a red light?

32:50.737 --> 32:52.170
And not just any red light.

32:52.172 --> 32:55.205
And that's not
just any car, is it?

32:55.208 --> 32:56.473
That's the SUV
that was carjacked.

32:56.476 --> 32:59.576
19 minutes
after Gibson was shot.

32:59.578 --> 33:00.944
You have his last known?

33:00.946 --> 33:03.047
The squad and ESU
are already on their way.

33:12.123 --> 33:15.732
Let's go.
Hey, easy, easy!

33:15.733 --> 33:17.834
Come on!

33:17.836 --> 33:19.536
Come on, let me go.
I didn't even...

33:22.039 --> 33:23.105
So that's our guy?

33:23.107 --> 33:24.874
That's him.

33:24.875 --> 33:26.576
They recovered a nine
beneath his mattress.

33:26.577 --> 33:29.211
Prints and everything.

33:29.213 --> 33:30.713
Dummy.

33:30.715 --> 33:32.515
He ain't no genius,
that's for sure.

33:34.885 --> 33:36.219
What?

33:37.556 --> 33:40.256
We're gonna have to work on
your double negatives, Anthony.

33:40.258 --> 33:41.391
The what?

33:41.393 --> 33:43.026
Nothing.

33:43.028 --> 33:44.594
Absolutely nothing.

33:44.596 --> 33:45.961
You did good.

33:45.963 --> 33:47.262
I did <i> well.</i>

33:47.265 --> 33:48.364
It's an adverb.

33:48.365 --> 33:49.699
(scoffs)

33:50.836 --> 33:52.434
Good night, Anthony.

33:52.436 --> 33:53.802
Good night.

34:10.588 --> 34:11.987
I can't believe
you're doing this.

34:11.989 --> 34:13.422
Well, it's the right
thing to do.

34:13.425 --> 34:14.989
No, it's not.

34:14.992 --> 34:16.925
Uh, yes, I think
you'll see that it is.

34:16.927 --> 34:18.128
How many times

34:18.130 --> 34:19.429
have I kept my mouth shut

34:19.431 --> 34:20.797
as I watched you bend the rules?

34:20.797 --> 34:22.164
Tons.

34:22.166 --> 34:23.132
Exactly.

34:23.135 --> 34:24.567
And the one time I ask you

34:24.568 --> 34:26.202
to look the other way
just a little bit,

34:26.204 --> 34:28.637
to help a fellow cop, no less,

34:28.639 --> 34:29.773
you can't be there for me.

34:29.775 --> 34:30.606
Baez...

34:30.608 --> 34:32.375
No, Danny, look...

34:32.376 --> 34:33.842
Listen to me.

34:33.844 --> 34:36.612
Look, I get it, okay?
You think this guy's a bum.

34:36.614 --> 34:39.148
Don't do it for him.
Do it for me.

34:48.293 --> 34:49.458
Why are you turning off here?

34:49.460 --> 34:52.262
Because this is the way
to the rehab facility.

34:58.068 --> 35:00.202
Little bit of love, right?

35:00.204 --> 35:02.771
A lot of love.
Mm-hmm.

35:05.309 --> 35:08.010
(chuckles)

35:08.012 --> 35:10.179
(sighs)

35:11.817 --> 35:13.048
POOLE:
Come in.

35:14.385 --> 35:15.885
Commissioner Reagan's here
to see you, sir.

35:15.887 --> 35:17.019
Unscheduled?

35:17.021 --> 35:18.086
Yes, sir.

35:18.088 --> 35:19.588
This isn't a good time.

35:19.590 --> 35:20.590
I know that, sir.

35:20.592 --> 35:22.090
FRANK:
I apologize.

35:22.092 --> 35:23.425
I could reschedule.

35:23.427 --> 35:24.893
FRANK:
I really do.

35:24.896 --> 35:26.496
No, no. Just send him in.

35:28.032 --> 35:29.532
Commissioner Reagan.

35:39.376 --> 35:40.543
(sighs)

35:43.114 --> 35:45.114
I'm sorry.

35:45.115 --> 35:46.081
For what?

35:46.083 --> 35:47.784
For popping in like this.

35:47.786 --> 35:48.717
That's it?

35:48.719 --> 35:50.686
That's it.

35:50.688 --> 35:52.521
You got something else?

35:52.523 --> 35:53.989
Seriously, Frank?

35:53.992 --> 35:55.458
Good.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.925
You got something else
you want to ask me?

35:56.927 --> 36:00.028
Do you have something
you're eager to get asked?

36:00.030 --> 36:04.567
Yes, I would strongly recommend
Chief Alberto Segura.

36:04.568 --> 36:06.268
Okay...

36:06.271 --> 36:08.704
I talked to him
just before you did.

36:08.706 --> 36:10.739
But I didn't ask
for your recommendation, Frank.

36:10.742 --> 36:12.641
Free advice.

36:12.643 --> 36:13.909
Okay.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.244
Well, since you're
giving free advice,

36:15.246 --> 36:16.579
I'll offer some of my own.

36:16.581 --> 36:18.248
Hilary Shields.
Who's that?

36:18.250 --> 36:19.681
My campaign strategist.

36:19.684 --> 36:20.682
Best in the business.

36:20.684 --> 36:22.184
So?
So...

36:22.186 --> 36:23.619
since you want
to do my job...

36:23.621 --> 36:25.355
I don't want your job.

36:25.356 --> 36:27.344
No, you just want to be
a backseat driver.

36:27.344 --> 36:28.121
Nope.

36:28.213 --> 36:31.860
I just want to be seen
for what I've become.

36:31.862 --> 36:34.097
Which is?

36:34.099 --> 36:35.264
Well, when you first got elected

36:35.266 --> 36:37.266
and you asked me
to stay onto this job,

36:37.268 --> 36:39.501
I looked way
to the right of you.

36:39.503 --> 36:41.170
And you used
that perception

36:41.172 --> 36:42.639
to maneuver through
your first term,

36:42.641 --> 36:45.108
and you used it
to get re-elected.

36:45.110 --> 36:46.409
Used it?

36:46.411 --> 36:47.809
The liberal crusader

36:47.811 --> 36:50.280
with the right-leaning
law-and-order PC at his side.

36:50.282 --> 36:52.882
And you want to be seen
as what, Frank?

36:52.884 --> 36:54.983
Well, you know that thing

36:54.985 --> 36:57.519
where you're in the ocean
and you're swimming around

36:57.521 --> 37:00.088
and you look to the shore

37:00.090 --> 37:02.157
and you can't believe
that all of a sudden

37:02.159 --> 37:04.793
the lifeguard stand
is all the way over there?

37:04.795 --> 37:07.163
Mm-hmm.

37:07.164 --> 37:10.333
Well, the lifeguard stand
didn't drift.

37:10.335 --> 37:13.036
You did.

37:13.038 --> 37:15.771
The lifeguard stand
is right where it always was.

37:16.675 --> 37:18.141
And you're the lifeguard stand.

37:18.143 --> 37:19.309
That's right.

37:19.311 --> 37:20.976
And for better or worse,

37:20.978 --> 37:24.047
I am right where
I'm supposed to be,

37:24.048 --> 37:27.182
and I would like to think
that I can serve

37:27.184 --> 37:30.920
both you and the greater good
from that fixed position.

37:32.990 --> 37:36.224
And I'd like to think
that's valuable.

37:40.364 --> 37:43.666
So, is there anything else
you want to ask me?

37:45.003 --> 37:47.235
Frank, you want to stay on
as my police commissioner?

37:47.237 --> 37:48.438
Yes.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.204
Thank you.

37:49.206 --> 37:50.739
Thank you.

37:52.943 --> 37:54.143
May I?

37:56.313 --> 37:58.014
When should we schedule
the ceremony?

37:58.016 --> 37:59.315
I wouldn't.

38:00.751 --> 38:01.851
What do you mean, you wouldn't?

38:01.853 --> 38:03.152
Well, we both have enough

38:03.153 --> 38:05.521
pomp and circumstance
on our schedule.

38:05.523 --> 38:06.789
Here.

38:06.791 --> 38:08.157
There you go.

38:12.896 --> 38:14.230
"I, Mayor Carter Poole,

38:14.231 --> 38:16.365
"do hereby reappoint
Francis X. Reagan

38:16.367 --> 38:19.434
as Police Commissioner
for the City of New York."

38:19.436 --> 38:21.170
Sign at the bottom.

38:22.606 --> 38:24.907
Don't we need a notary
or something?

38:24.909 --> 38:27.443
Nah, it's us.

38:28.646 --> 38:30.346
(knocking at door)

38:30.347 --> 38:31.380
(door opens)

38:31.382 --> 38:33.849
These just came for you.

38:37.956 --> 38:38.887
The mayor?

38:38.889 --> 38:41.224
And... Mrs. Gibson
is here again.

38:42.393 --> 38:43.960
Should I call security?

38:43.961 --> 38:46.396
No, that's all right.
Show her in.

38:48.666 --> 38:50.333
Mrs. Gibson.

38:55.340 --> 38:58.306
Good evening, Mrs. Gibson.

39:01.545 --> 39:03.445
I shouldn't have slapped you.

39:03.447 --> 39:06.882
That's all right.

39:08.452 --> 39:09.619
I wanted to thank you

39:09.621 --> 39:13.588
for finding the monster
that killed my Donald.

39:13.590 --> 39:14.856
I...

39:14.858 --> 39:18.460
But...?

39:18.463 --> 39:21.364
I don't know.

39:21.365 --> 39:23.231
I thought it would
feel better...

39:23.233 --> 39:25.701
justice and all that.

39:29.974 --> 39:32.909
I lost my brother Joe
in the line of duty.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.782
Does it get easier?

39:49.460 --> 39:50.860
(crying)

39:50.862 --> 39:52.327
(sighs)

39:53.597 --> 39:55.797
(sobbing)

39:58.503 --> 40:00.168
I'm sorry.

40:09.813 --> 40:12.514
(dishes clinking)

40:12.516 --> 40:15.117
Would someone please
pass the potatoes?

40:16.286 --> 40:17.420
Coming down.

40:17.422 --> 40:18.954
And more of that cabbage,
please.

40:18.956 --> 40:21.356
Huh?
More of that cabbage, Danny?

40:21.358 --> 40:25.193
Can anyone explain
why we have a... a rain forest

40:25.195 --> 40:26.461
growing out of
the middle of our table?

40:26.463 --> 40:28.664
You don't like my flowers?

40:28.666 --> 40:30.166
It's just, they're...

40:30.168 --> 40:31.967
Big enough
to be a new family member.

40:31.969 --> 40:33.001
That.

40:33.003 --> 40:34.103
Where'd you get them?

40:34.105 --> 40:35.670
They were a gift, actually.

40:35.672 --> 40:38.141
LINDA: Ooh!
Hubba hubba.

40:38.143 --> 40:40.443
Who is sending you
flowers like those?

40:40.445 --> 40:41.409
The mayor.

40:41.411 --> 40:42.344
HENRY:
What?

40:42.347 --> 40:44.380
Why is Mayor Poole
sending you...

40:44.382 --> 40:45.847
two dozen roses?

40:45.849 --> 40:48.684
That's an excellent question.

40:48.686 --> 40:50.485
(glass clinking)

40:51.688 --> 40:53.922
I would like

40:53.925 --> 40:56.025
to propose a toast.

40:56.027 --> 40:57.527
(clears throat)

40:59.063 --> 40:59.996
What's the toast?

40:59.998 --> 41:03.231
To Commissioner
Francis X. Reagan.

41:03.233 --> 41:04.367
NICKY:
Oh.

41:04.369 --> 41:07.003
Commissioner Reagan?
Commissioner Reagan?

41:07.005 --> 41:08.704
Okay.

41:08.706 --> 41:10.405
I was over with the mayor

41:10.407 --> 41:12.340
and he asked me to stay on.

41:12.342 --> 41:13.476
And I said yes.

41:13.478 --> 41:14.911
(laughter, whooping)

41:14.913 --> 41:16.646
Congratulations!

41:16.648 --> 41:17.679
Congratulations!

41:17.681 --> 41:20.081
Hey! Hey!
Congratulations.

41:20.083 --> 41:23.018
It, uh, seemed like
a good idea at the time.

41:23.021 --> 41:24.619
Dad...

41:24.621 --> 41:25.820
What?

41:26.657 --> 41:28.456
Did you speak with the mayor

41:28.458 --> 41:29.858
about anything else
while you were there?

41:29.860 --> 41:32.494
Not that I recall.

41:32.496 --> 41:34.429
Did you
or did you not promise me

41:34.431 --> 41:36.157
you would not raise a stink
with the mayor?

41:36.157 --> 41:36.764
I did.

41:36.768 --> 41:38.233
And then you went ahead

41:38.235 --> 41:39.235
and did it anyway.

41:39.237 --> 41:40.268
I did not.

41:40.271 --> 41:41.436
I kept my promise.

41:41.438 --> 41:44.507
So it's just a coincidence
that the mayor

41:44.509 --> 41:46.775
sent me flowers with a card
that said "I'm sorry"?

41:46.777 --> 41:48.510
FRANK:
I don't know.

41:48.512 --> 41:50.713
Probably not.

41:52.516 --> 41:53.748
What are you playing at?

41:53.751 --> 41:55.318
NICKY:
Yeah, Grandpa.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.686
How else can you explain this?

41:57.688 --> 41:58.987
Well, last time I checked,

41:58.989 --> 42:00.889
we had some of the best
police minds in the business

42:00.891 --> 42:01.990
at this table.

42:01.992 --> 42:03.259
Maybe some of you
can figure it out.

42:03.260 --> 42:04.827
You put Garrett up to it.

42:04.829 --> 42:05.927
Negative.

42:05.929 --> 42:07.063
I got it.

42:07.065 --> 42:08.231
Oh, yeah?

42:08.233 --> 42:08.965
Uh-huh.

42:08.967 --> 42:10.065
Me, too.

42:10.068 --> 42:11.266
Me three.

42:11.268 --> 42:12.768
And how about you?

42:14.105 --> 42:16.672
You had already gone.

42:16.673 --> 42:18.807
Exactly.

42:18.809 --> 42:20.409
You're the worst.

42:20.411 --> 42:22.744
And you're the best.

42:22.746 --> 42:25.715
(laughter)

42:28.052 --> 42:30.052
I'll drink to that.

42:30.054 --> 42:32.255
(laughter)
