00:07.408 --> 00:09.343
(birds tweeting)

00:09.343 --> 00:11.912
**

00:11.912 --> 00:13.881
(sighs)

00:13.881 --> 00:16.184
(snoring softly)

00:16.184 --> 00:17.118
(sighs)

00:18.886 --> 00:20.088
Ugh.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.462
(gasps)

00:28.462 --> 00:30.631
Uh-oh.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.400
Murph.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.967
(yelps)

00:33.967 --> 00:35.703
(tires screeching)

00:35.703 --> 00:37.971
Go, go, go!

00:37.971 --> 00:40.974
(woman)
We're never
having sex again.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.143
What if you're pregnant?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.278
I mean, is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:44.278 --> 00:45.246
I don't know!

00:47.281 --> 00:48.749
Ugh.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.252
I mean...
maybe it's time.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.986
We gotta have kids
at some point,

00:52.986 --> 00:56.990
and my biological clock
is ticking, so...

00:56.990 --> 00:59.493
(distant whistling)

00:59.493 --> 01:01.595
Emily, what was that?

01:01.595 --> 01:04.998
I must've stated a commonly
held misconception.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.135
(loud thud)

01:09.603 --> 01:10.938
(rumbling)

01:12.773 --> 01:13.841
He's coming.

01:14.975 --> 01:15.909
(both shrieking)

01:15.909 --> 01:16.810
Hello, my friends!

01:16.810 --> 01:17.811
(both)
Ugh.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.147
Hate to break it
to you guys,

01:19.147 --> 01:22.116
but everything you know
about having a baby is wrong.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.685
Okay, worst entrance...
by far.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.786
Thank you!

01:25.786 --> 01:28.289
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,
and this is...

01:28.289 --> 01:29.990
(both)
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:29.990 --> 01:31.259
**

01:31.259 --> 01:32.160
Oh!
Ugh.

01:33.827 --> 01:34.795
(screaming)

01:39.700 --> 01:41.135
Hiatus over
already, huh?

01:41.135 --> 01:43.804
Yep, it's a whole new season.
Joy.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.440
Okay, so what'd I do
this time, huh?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.176
Did I pee
on the stick wrong?

01:48.176 --> 01:49.477
What? No.
It's that,

01:49.477 --> 01:51.479
when it comes to your
"biological clock,"

01:51.479 --> 01:53.647
you've got way more time
than you think.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.316
Uh, no, no, no.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.451
My uterus is getting worse
by the second.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.220
I mean, if I want
to have kids,

01:59.220 --> 02:02.122
I have to do it
by the time that I turn 35.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.991
Ah, yes, 35.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.659
The age when
the media tells us

02:05.659 --> 02:08.796
a woman's fertility rate
supposedly plummets.

02:08.796 --> 02:12.566
You got to get pretty serious
about having kids before 35.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.701
You're getting older,

02:13.701 --> 02:15.569
and you know that clock
is ticking.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.037
By the time we're 35,

02:17.037 --> 02:19.173
fertility has
decreased by 50%

02:19.173 --> 02:21.542
(Emily)
Gah! Whew.

02:21.542 --> 02:25.646
See? I got to get baking now
before this oven breaks down.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.915
I mean, they have
done studies.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.650
Sure, but where
those studies

02:29.650 --> 02:32.152
got their data from
is real weird.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.555
Was is it from a large,

02:34.555 --> 02:36.590
well-conducted sample
of modern women?

02:36.590 --> 02:39.427
Nope. It came from rural
French census records

02:39.427 --> 02:41.562
from the 1600s.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.030
(women coughing)

02:43.030 --> 02:44.698
Ohh... ohh...

02:44.698 --> 02:46.033
(speaking French)

02:50.204 --> 02:53.073
Wait, seriously?
I have been getting
fertility advice

02:53.073 --> 02:55.943
from a bunch of 400-year-old
French farmers?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
(woman)
Unfortunately, yes.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.413
Oh! Emily,
this is Jean Twenge,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.749
the author of
"The Impatient Woman's
Guide to Getting Pregnant"

03:01.749 --> 03:04.385
and the researcher
who discovered the truth
about this data.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.920
You know, when I wanted
to have kids in my late 30s,

03:06.920 --> 03:09.557
I was as freaked out
about these studies as anyone.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.725
But I'm researcher,
so I looked into it.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.395
And I found out that nobody
really noticed that these claims

03:14.395 --> 03:16.564
were based
on such old data.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.565
And that's a problem,

03:17.565 --> 03:19.767
because that means
they come from a time

03:19.767 --> 03:23.237
before fertility treatment,
antibiotics, or modern medicine.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.739
Yeah, there could've been
a lot of reasons these women

03:25.739 --> 03:27.808
weren't getting pregnant
after 35.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.310
Maybe their husbands
had gone to war.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.778
Maybe they had diseases.

03:30.778 --> 03:31.879
Or, I don't know,

03:31.879 --> 03:33.247
maybe they just
stopped having sex.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.250
Um....

03:39.052 --> 03:41.255
They truth is,
in modern data,

03:41.255 --> 03:43.591
average woman age 27
who's healthy

03:43.591 --> 03:47.127
has an 86% chance of getting
pregnant within a year.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.263
And that same woman
at age 37,

03:49.263 --> 03:51.632
her chances are to 82%.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.267
That's like
barely a difference.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.436
You know, if you don't have
fertility problems already,

03:55.436 --> 03:57.271
you can have a baby
later than you think.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.139
Age doesn't really
affect fertility that much

03:59.139 --> 04:00.808
until you're in your 40s.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.343
Take it from me,
I had three kids--

04:02.343 --> 04:05.613
one at 35, another at 38,
and then at 40.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.648
Whew, congratulations.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.350
Honestly,
it was no sweat.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.084
Okay, farmers,
let's get you

04:11.084 --> 04:12.820
back to the past
where you belong.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.121
Thanks, Jean.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.489
Yeah, au revoir, everyone,
au revoir.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.024
Yeah, merci very much.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.959
But I read
that by the age of 40,

04:18.959 --> 04:21.795
your chances
of birth defects double.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.163
(woman screams)

04:23.163 --> 04:25.499
You know, the hen house
may be workin',

04:25.499 --> 04:27.668
but the eggs are goin' sour.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.636
Not quite.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.671
Miscarriages do become
more common,

04:30.671 --> 04:32.706
but your chances of having
a baby with a birth defect

04:32.706 --> 04:37.177
only "double" from .5%...
to 1%.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.145
That's like nothing.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.347
Yeah, exactly.

04:39.347 --> 04:42.383
But if they say it doubles,
it sounds way scarier

04:42.383 --> 04:44.217
and sells more magazines.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.655
All this fear-mongering
has caused a generation of women

04:47.655 --> 04:50.491
to panic that they're going
infertile in their 30s.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.225
And if you've seen
this show before,

04:52.225 --> 04:54.328
you know what happens
when people get scared--

04:54.328 --> 04:57.164
corporate America swoops in
to take advantage.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.399
**

04:58.399 --> 04:59.567
(wind whipping)

04:59.567 --> 05:04.505
Egg freezing industry,
"ice" to meet you.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.008
Egg freezing began
as a way for women

05:08.008 --> 05:10.844
to save their eggs before
undergoing chemotherapy.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.246
But today, it's grown into
vanity industry

05:13.246 --> 05:16.550
that preys
on fertility fear.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.019
Your eggs
are rotting, fast.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.855
So we're gonna freeze some now
and thaw them out later

05:21.855 --> 05:24.024
when you're ready
to have a baby.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.393
What she failed to mention

05:25.393 --> 05:28.061
is that each of those eggs
only has a 2% to 12% chance

05:28.061 --> 05:29.397
of resulting in a baby,

05:29.397 --> 05:30.864
and the whole shebang
is gonna cost you

05:30.864 --> 05:33.401
upwards of $20,000.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.168
20 grand?
Yeah.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.505
And all that money
is usually wasted.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.873
The vast majority of women
who freeze their eggs

05:39.873 --> 05:42.710
never actually use them
because, again,

05:42.710 --> 05:45.413
you can get pregnant in life
later than you think.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.214
You scammer.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.882
Oh, oh, "snow."

05:49.950 --> 05:52.119
(wind whipping)

05:52.119 --> 05:53.887
That was awesome!

05:53.887 --> 05:55.723
Truth is, Emily,

05:55.723 --> 05:57.891
if you're in good health
through your early 40s,

05:57.891 --> 06:00.594
you don't really need to stress
that much about fertility.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.397
I've been planning my
whole life around the idea

06:03.397 --> 06:05.899
that we have to have
a baby soon.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.401
Well, you don't.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.936
If you're not ready
to have a kid now,

06:08.936 --> 06:11.572
that's okay...
you've got time.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.410
Man, I feel
so much better.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.779
You know what?
Why rush this?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.581
We should just
wait to get...

06:20.581 --> 06:22.450
pregnant?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.454
We're gonna be
parents!

06:26.454 --> 06:27.588
Sorry.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.625
I'm pregnant.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.226
There's a thing
inside you.

06:33.226 --> 06:37.798
Yeah, there's a--
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.433
Ah, woof.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.435
It just sucks I can't
get nooched or do judo

06:41.435 --> 06:43.003
for, like, nine months.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.972
Kind of wish I could just,
like, skip the pregnancy

06:44.972 --> 06:46.740
and get right to the baby.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.108
Oh, I can help
with that!

06:50.611 --> 06:52.946
(both scream)

06:52.946 --> 06:55.182
Now, let's talk
baby names.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.784
**

07:00.120 --> 07:02.790
(crowd applauding)

07:09.697 --> 07:11.298
Let me do it.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.634
Oh... so you
have a baby.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.835
That happened fast.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.303
I know.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.305
I wonder if I'll
ever have kids.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.341
You know, I have been
talking to a girl online.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.643
Sure you have, bud.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.011
(baby crying)

07:24.011 --> 07:26.547
Ooh, it's okay, heh.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.815
(gasps)
Ah, wait.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.182
Is that formula?

07:29.182 --> 07:31.519
No, tell me
you're breastfeeding.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.353
Oh, um, well, I tried.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.489
But he kind of was having
a hard time latching
at the hospital,

07:35.489 --> 07:38.659
and the nurse says it was okay
that I supplement, so...

07:38.659 --> 07:41.862
Um, formula is toxic.
You have to breastfeed.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.130
Ugh, no way.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.632
I hate when people
breastfeed in public.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.834
Do that at home,
nobody wants to see that.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.502
Um, excuse me?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.504
It's totally natural,
women have been doing it

07:50.504 --> 07:51.672
for millions of years.
Excuse you.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.541
It's rude.
Rude?

07:53.541 --> 07:55.709
Nobody wants to see
your exposed nudity.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.010
Adam, help me.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.311
Tell them which one
is right.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.714
Oh, oh, no way am I
getting in the middle of this.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.883
I heard formula
has autism in it.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.151
(woman)
That's it!

08:06.353 --> 08:07.521
(both)
Hi, Miss Murphy.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.689
Hey, Patti.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.524
How many kids
do you knuckleheads have?

08:10.524 --> 08:11.525
(both)
None.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.027
Well, I have two,
so shut up.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.195
You, you're gonna tell a mom

08:15.195 --> 08:17.097
where and when she can
feed her baby?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.398
Get a life!

08:18.398 --> 08:21.368
Breastfeeding is normal,
natural, and great.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.703
Preach, sister.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.873
And you, how dare you judge
how a mom feeds her kid.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.841
Formula isn't
just healthy and safe,

08:27.841 --> 08:29.543
it's a literal lifesaver.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.579
Emily, let me show you.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.580
Okay.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.415
Knowledge from
a primary source.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.717
(squeals)

08:36.717 --> 08:38.952
Oh, thank goodness.
Can you help me?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.421
Because the hospital says
it's okay to use formula.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.924
But then I read
an article online
that says it's baby poison.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.726
Honey, I was
just like you.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.728
First kid, I worried
about everything.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.130
Second one,
not so much.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.032
And formula
isn't poison.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.734
It's a friggin' godsend.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.938
Before formula,

08:57.938 --> 08:58.972
the only way
to feed your baby

08:58.972 --> 09:00.407
was to breastfeed.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.743
And forget about
getting anything else done

09:02.743 --> 09:05.078
because breastfeeding
takes 35 hours a week.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.581
What? That's like
a full-time job.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.950
And the worst thing is,
if you couldn't breastfeed,

09:09.950 --> 09:11.919
there weren't any other
good options.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.386
(Irish accent)
My teat's all tapped.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.924
Looks like bread soaked in water
for you little spud.

09:16.924 --> 09:17.991
This is a real thing
people did.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.927
Babies grew up
malnourished or died

09:19.927 --> 09:21.428
if their moms
couldn't breastfeed.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.830
Oh, that's horrible.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.798
Then, in 1865,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.600
this friggin'
Albert Einstein

09:26.600 --> 09:27.901
named Justus von Liebig,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.603
invented baby formula.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.940
Ma'am, your babe shall
no longer dine on duck food.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.610
Instead, he will dine...
on science.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.646
Formula allowed women
to leave the house

09:38.646 --> 09:40.113
or join the workforce.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.783
But most importantly,
it saved babies' lives.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.952
Look out, world,
here we come!

09:46.319 --> 09:47.454
Hmm!

09:47.454 --> 09:48.789
No, I need that.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.091
Formula isn't scary--
it's a modern miracle.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.293
Okay, but isn't formula
just a bunch of chemicals?

09:53.293 --> 09:55.095
Well, yeah, Emily, it is,

09:55.095 --> 09:57.464
because literally everything
is a bunch of chemicals.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.299
Breast milk
is also chemicals.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.468
The question is
whether those chemicals

10:01.468 --> 10:03.536
are nutritionally
different.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.806
And the answer is no.

10:05.806 --> 10:09.109
Meet professor
and lactation expert
Courtney Jung.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.110
Hi, Emily.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.645
Hi!
Patti's right.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.281
Formula is a safe
and nutritionally complete

10:14.281 --> 10:16.016
alternative to breast milk.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.987
For things like IQ,
asthma, allergies, eczema,

10:19.987 --> 10:22.155
once you account
for income and education,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.824
there's almost no difference

10:23.824 --> 10:26.493
between breastfeeding
and formula feeding.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.628
The evidence that breastfeeding
makes a difference

10:28.628 --> 10:30.497
is just inconclusive.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.165
Oh, yeah.
I formula-fed Murph.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.667
I breastfed
his brother Durph,

10:33.667 --> 10:34.802
and they're both idiots.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.336
(Murph)
Aw, Mom!

10:36.336 --> 10:37.905
Durph just threw
a bocce ball at me!

10:37.905 --> 10:39.639
Hey, dude, look here.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.508
Idiot!
Dude.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.910
Murph has a brother?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.045
Yeah, luckily
he doesn't visit much.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.413
You're done, dude.

10:46.413 --> 10:50.650
The fact is formula feeding
is a completely safe

10:50.650 --> 10:53.220
and nutritious alternative
to breastfeeding.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.824
If you want or need
to feed your baby formula,

10:56.824 --> 10:58.692
do it with confidence.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.560
Wow. Thank you.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.561
Thanks,
Professor Jung.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.562
No, wait!

11:02.562 --> 11:03.663
(can clangs)

11:05.232 --> 11:07.768
What about places
where they don't have
access to clean water?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.169
Good question, hairball.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.039
Mixing contaminated water
with formula can be harmful.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.175
But if you use clean water
and sterilized bottles,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.277
it's a completely safe
and nutritious option.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.211
Oh.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.081
Not so fast.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.250
I read mommy blogs,
like, for fun.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.219
And they say that breastfeeding
actually makes your baby

11:26.219 --> 11:28.889
love you more because
it releases a bonding chemical

11:28.889 --> 11:30.623
called oxytocin.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.392
Oh, oh, can I
take this one?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.393
Go ahead.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.962
Oxytocin is a hormone

11:34.962 --> 11:36.096
that gets released

11:36.096 --> 11:38.031
when you do things
like hug or cuddle.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.134
That's why the media loves
to call it "the love hormone."

11:41.134 --> 11:42.635
**

11:42.635 --> 11:44.637
But that same hormone
is also released

11:44.637 --> 11:47.607
when you do things like
fire a gun or watch porn.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.476
(gunshot)

11:49.476 --> 11:51.578
That's because hormones
are complicated chemicals

11:51.578 --> 11:53.413
that get released
all the dang time.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.149
And the truth is we don't
understand them that well.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.786
According to a comprehensive
review from 2008,

11:58.786 --> 12:01.288
there is no convincing support
for a connection between

12:01.288 --> 12:04.457
breastfeeding and the quality of
the mother-infant relationship.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.793
Hmph!

12:05.793 --> 12:08.295
Breastfeeding is a great way
to bond with your baby.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.897
But it's not the only one.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.465
And the fact is
not all women can do it.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.835
15% of moms can't breastfeed,

12:14.835 --> 12:18.071
not to mention the parents
who foster and adopt.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.241
So, the next time someone
tries to guilt trip you

12:21.241 --> 12:24.277
or any other parent about
how they feed their baby,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.279
you tell them
they can eat my feet.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.447
Thanks, Patti.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.618
Wait, where's my baby?

12:31.618 --> 12:34.955
(gently)
Then, Ronda ripped
Carmouche's arm back

12:34.955 --> 12:37.290
until she was forced
to tap out.

12:37.290 --> 12:41.628
Yeah... and that's the UFC fight
where Mommy and Daddy met.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.297
You know, Emily, another
great benefit of formula

12:44.297 --> 12:45.966
is that while Murph
feeds the baby,

12:45.966 --> 12:47.467
you get a chance to--

12:47.467 --> 12:48.802
(snoring)

12:48.802 --> 12:52.605
Oh, she looks like
a little angel.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.108
Wonder how she'll take the news
about postpartum depression?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.044
Nah, I'll break it to her
after she wakes up.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.445
Shh.
Okay. Go.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.349
(snoring)

13:04.384 --> 13:07.720
**

13:07.720 --> 13:08.956
Hello, everybody,

13:08.956 --> 13:10.991
I'm here in the "Adam
Ruins Everything" office

13:10.991 --> 13:12.993
with Courtney Jung
because I have

13:12.993 --> 13:15.528
a few more questions for her
about breastfeeding.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.364
So how did we get this idea

13:17.364 --> 13:19.332
that breastfeeding
is the only way to go?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.400
Where'd that come from?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.070
That goes all the way
back to 1970s.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.406
You have Nestle
producing formula

13:26.406 --> 13:29.476
and aggressively marketing it
in poor countries

13:29.476 --> 13:32.179
where woman don't
have access to clean water,

13:32.179 --> 13:36.850
and they are over diluting
formula because it's expensive.

13:36.850 --> 13:37.918
Oh...

13:37.918 --> 13:39.920
So it leads to babies
that are malnourished

13:39.920 --> 13:41.021
and actually dying.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.556
So you have a spike
in infant mortality.

13:43.556 --> 13:47.227
And that creates the impression
that formula is dangerous.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.930
But all the activism
against Nestle,

13:49.930 --> 13:53.266
you have the Nestle Boycott
starting in the 1970s

13:53.266 --> 13:56.069
continuing to this day.

13:56.069 --> 14:00.540
That's the history of the idea
that formula is poison.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.376
So what happened was Nestle
sort of pushed formula

14:03.376 --> 14:04.777
in these places where formula

14:04.777 --> 14:07.114
wasn't really appropriate
in those countries,

14:07.114 --> 14:09.049
but people sort of
generalized that

14:09.049 --> 14:11.084
into this overall idea
that formula

14:11.084 --> 14:13.720
is bad everywhere
when it really isn't.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.225
Well, the fact is
that around 15% of mothers

14:18.225 --> 14:20.460
actually cannot breastfeed.
Really?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.463
They will not produce enough
milk to feed their babies.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.366
And so for
that 15% of women

14:26.366 --> 14:28.902
who actually, literally,
can't breastfeed,

14:28.902 --> 14:32.439
formula is obviously
a lifesaver for their children.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.207
Those women shouldn't
be stigmatized

14:34.207 --> 14:36.309
in any way for that.
Right, exactly.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.978
One of the things that happens

14:37.978 --> 14:41.581
is that babies
are endangered.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.285
Because women truly believe
all women can breastfeed.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.920
"All women" can breastfeed

14:46.920 --> 14:50.457
is one of the slogans
of breastfeeding advocates.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.426
So women believe,
and doctors tell them,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.596
all women can breastfeed,
which is simply not true.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.466
And so that's what
leads to the shame.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.135
And I want to be clear,
like-- like your position

15:02.135 --> 15:05.905
is that, uh, breastfeeding
is a great thing to do.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.608
Absolutely.
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with it if--

15:08.608 --> 15:12.245
I have two kids,
I've breastfeed both my kids.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.913
For me, it was easy.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.950
But it's not easy
for a lot of people.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.752
If breastfeeding works
for you, that's great.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.688
If formula feeding
works for you,

15:21.688 --> 15:23.923
your baby's
going to be okay, too.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.959
Well, Courtney,
thank you so much again

15:25.959 --> 15:28.628
for coming on the show
to talk us about this topic.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.297
And, guys, we will be back
in just a second

15:30.297 --> 15:32.699
with more
"Adam Ruins Everything."

15:35.168 --> 15:36.303
(baby cooing)

15:36.303 --> 15:37.704
(gasps)
Look at you.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.339
Maternal bliss.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.674
This is the happiest time
in a woman's life.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.643
It was probably
love at first sight.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.980
God, aren't you just, like,
obsessed with your baby?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.516
I-- I mean, I guess.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.352
Wow, look at the time.
Let's go.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.988
You'd take a bullet
for him, right?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.023
Right?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.993
Hey.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.329
I guess it's--
it's just us now.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.330
(baby fussing)

16:03.330 --> 16:05.999
Oh! Shh, shh.
Oh, come on.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.500
(baby crying)
You're happy.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.038
I'm happy.
Love at first sight, remember?

16:11.038 --> 16:12.339
(crying continues)

16:12.339 --> 16:14.974
Would I take
a bullet for you?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.243
I don't know.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.844
I don't know if I would.
I don't know you.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.347
You are a freaking stranger!

16:20.347 --> 16:23.550
Ohh... hi, baby.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.852
(chuckles)
Oh... here we go.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.587
There we are.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.522
Uh...

16:29.522 --> 16:33.026
He, Em.
What's goin' on?

16:33.026 --> 16:36.029
It's just this instant
maternal joy

16:36.029 --> 16:39.066
that everyone says
I'm supposed to feel.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.733
It's not there.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.071
I'm a bad mom.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.039
Emily... you know
it's normal

16:46.039 --> 16:49.209
not to instantly fall
in love with your baby, right?

16:49.209 --> 16:50.210
No, it's not!

16:50.210 --> 16:51.711
We're supposed to have
this ancient

16:51.711 --> 16:53.046
mother-child bond,

16:53.046 --> 16:55.048
and it's not happening!

16:55.048 --> 16:58.218
Actually, that idea
is really recent.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.120
Really?
Yeah.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.589
In that past, infant
mortality was so high,

17:02.589 --> 17:05.392
many people preferred
not to get too attached.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.694
Sometimes, they wouldn't
even name the baby

17:07.694 --> 17:10.230
until it had survived
an entire year.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.065
Nice to meet you,
number four.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.067
I hope you make it.

17:14.067 --> 17:17.404
But after modern medicine,
infant morality plummeted.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.772
It became safer to emotionally
invest sooner,

17:19.772 --> 17:24.411
and we developed this idea of
an instant mother-child romance.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.045
Oh, my!

17:26.045 --> 17:28.581
Who are you?

17:28.581 --> 17:30.417
But as far
as scientists can tell,

17:30.417 --> 17:33.453
there's no biological basis
for this behavior.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.789
It's just a cultural shift
we made about 100 years ago.

17:36.789 --> 17:40.127
Now, if you immediately
feel that maternal joy,

17:40.127 --> 17:41.294
that's great.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.263
But if you don't,
there's nothing wrong

17:43.263 --> 17:45.465
or unnatural about that.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.635
Sometimes, that kind of love
just takes time to grow.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.137
Or you might have...

17:50.137 --> 17:52.439
(trumpet fanfare)

17:52.439 --> 17:53.440
(slide whistle,
whoopee cushion)

17:53.440 --> 17:55.275
Postpartum depression!

17:55.275 --> 17:56.509
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.644
I don't want this.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.312
You don't
have a choice.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.349
Postpartum depression
is chemically identical

18:02.349 --> 18:03.650
to regular depression,

18:03.650 --> 18:05.952
except it's triggered
by pregnancy.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.487
And it's really common.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.290
Every year,
up to 600,000 women

18:10.290 --> 18:12.125
get it in the US alone.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.994
That's more common
than breast cancer!

18:14.994 --> 18:16.196
Ugh, sorry.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.331
Durph's PT Cruiser
wouldn't start.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.200
Whoa, what's happening?
What's this bird?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.334
Oh, he brings...

18:21.334 --> 18:23.035
Postpartum depression!

18:23.035 --> 18:24.704
(slide whistle, clunk)
What?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.973
Men can get it, too!
Hmm.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.641
Oh, this
feels awful.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.144
(thunder rumbling)

18:31.144 --> 18:34.781
(rain pattering)

18:34.781 --> 18:37.016
I just don't feel
like myself anymore.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.555
I feel stuck.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.858
Like every decision
I am ever going to make,

18:45.858 --> 18:47.860
I have already made.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.498
And I don't know if I like
the way that it turned out.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.900
I just-- I feel like
I'm gonna feel this way

18:53.900 --> 18:55.868
for the rest of my life.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.504
You don't have to.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.673
There is an effective treatment
for postpartum depression.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.009
Really?
Wh-What is it?

19:03.009 --> 19:04.344
Talking about it.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.380
Research shows that just
a few short therapy sessions

19:07.380 --> 19:10.683
can dramatically reduce
feelings of guilt and sadness.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.386
But we're so scared
to talk about this problem

19:13.386 --> 19:15.188
that more than
half of women

19:15.188 --> 19:17.390
never even tell their friends
they have it.

19:17.390 --> 19:21.361
And only 15%
ever go to a therapist.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.763
15? That's really low.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.265
Yeah... it's a shame,

19:25.265 --> 19:28.235
because talking
really is the best medicine.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.003
(exhales shakily)

19:32.572 --> 19:36.276
Murph... I'm frustrated
with our baby,

19:36.276 --> 19:39.045
and sometimes,
I regret having him.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.282
And I feel guilty
that I feel that way.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.916
Emily...

19:43.916 --> 19:45.385
**

19:45.385 --> 19:46.453
Me, too.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.054
Really?

19:48.054 --> 19:51.123
Yeah... having a baby
kinda sucks.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.459
It does!

19:52.459 --> 19:54.894
And he's like so loud.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.896
And like,
he's cute, but...

19:56.896 --> 19:59.232
sometimes he just
looks like a wet cashew.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.933
Plus,
now there's just...

20:00.933 --> 20:03.069
(both)
...poop everywhere!

20:03.069 --> 20:06.138
Ahh, that feels better.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.441
(thud)

20:10.076 --> 20:12.745
(stork)
Mm, bea-utiful.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.314
Why are you still here?!

20:14.314 --> 20:15.715
(stork munching)

20:15.715 --> 20:18.084
(both sigh)

20:18.084 --> 20:20.253
I feel really
overwhelmed.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.489
Yeah, you're allowed to be.

20:22.489 --> 20:25.124
In this country, we put
so much pressure on ourselves

20:25.124 --> 20:27.960
to live out this
perfect parent narrative.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.763
You have to give birth young,
you have to breastfeed.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.632
You have to fall in love
with your baby instantly

20:32.632 --> 20:34.267
and be happy forever.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.635
But the truth is,

20:35.635 --> 20:38.405
no family's story is the same
as every other's.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.672
And you guys
have to do what's best

20:39.672 --> 20:42.742
for you and your family.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.778
Once again,
he's right.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.848
And, actually, there's one more
huge cultural norm

20:48.848 --> 20:50.783
you guys have been following
the whole time

20:50.783 --> 20:52.285
without even realizing it.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.820
What?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.288
Wh-What is it?

20:55.288 --> 20:56.489
Oh! I'll show you.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.626
(loud clattering,
couple screaming)

21:03.129 --> 21:05.798
**

21:05.798 --> 21:08.635
Welcome back!
I got more questions
for Jean Twenge.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.603
People say, "Oh, if I
have the kid later,"

21:10.603 --> 21:12.805
they have this idea that,
oh, then the kid's gonna
have a worse life.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.608
But there's also the idea
that if you spend more
time in the workforce

21:15.608 --> 21:17.710
to sort of get your income up,
or-- or save up,

21:17.710 --> 21:19.712
that can be just as beneficial
to the kids' life

21:19.712 --> 21:20.980
in terms of stability or--

21:20.980 --> 21:22.549
Yeah, absolutely--
there's a couple studies

21:22.549 --> 21:24.717
showing that women
who have kids younger, they--

21:24.717 --> 21:27.487
it ends up impacting
their overall lifetime income.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.988
So there's that
consideration, you know,

21:28.988 --> 21:30.957
for the woman
or the couple themselves.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.224
But then also for the kid.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.893
I mean, there's advantages
and disadvantages,

21:33.893 --> 21:35.662
no matter when you
have your kid.
Right.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.863
So you probably have
a little bit more energy

21:36.863 --> 21:38.831
if you have them earlier,
but you have less money...

21:38.831 --> 21:40.567
and less stability
and less maturity.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.870
So I think it's a good message
for women to know

21:43.870 --> 21:46.839
that there's not this,
oh, 35 and you're all done.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.307
I mean, that's sort of
one of the goals of our show

21:48.307 --> 21:50.042
is to sort of reduce worry,

21:50.042 --> 21:52.345
and so that was why we were
so happy to find your work.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.547
Well, and as a psychologist,
I endorse your goal, um...

21:54.547 --> 21:55.682
(laughing)

21:55.682 --> 21:57.350
Reducing worry
among the populace.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.419
That's great, well,
thank you so much for
being on the show, Jean.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.021
I really appreciate it.
Absolutely, thank you.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.424
(couple screaming)

22:04.424 --> 22:05.692
Where are we?

22:05.692 --> 22:08.260
We're in a time tunnel.
See? Look at all the clocks.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.762
We can't be
in a time tunnel.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.531
We have a baby
to take care of.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.765
Oh, no you don't.

22:12.765 --> 22:13.866
What?

22:13.866 --> 22:15.034
Oh, none of that happened.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.703
I just took you down
an alternate time line.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.037
Did I not say that
in act one?

22:18.037 --> 22:19.372
No!

22:19.372 --> 22:21.107
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.875
Normally, I say everything
that comes into my head.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.744
I thought I snapped.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.045
Why?!

22:26.045 --> 22:28.080
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to show you guys

22:28.080 --> 22:30.249
that you don't have to follow
this cultural script.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.552
You don't have to beat
the biological clock.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.621
You don't have to be
obsessed with your baby.

22:34.621 --> 22:37.223
Most importantly,
if you don't want to,

22:37.223 --> 22:39.225
you don't have
to have a kid at all.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.061
What? My mom told me
that if I don't have kids,

22:42.061 --> 22:43.596
I'm going to regret it!

22:43.596 --> 22:45.565
Yeah, isn't life empty
without them?

22:45.565 --> 22:46.733
That's true for some people,

22:46.733 --> 22:48.568
but it doesn't have to be
for everyone.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.236
Having a child
is rewarding,

22:50.236 --> 22:52.639
but it also closes off
other life paths

22:52.639 --> 22:54.073
that can be
just as rewarding.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.442
That baby really was
putting a crimp

22:55.442 --> 22:56.909
in my MMA career.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.411
But who's gonna take care
of us when we're old?

22:58.411 --> 22:59.746
I don't know,
maybe each other?

22:59.746 --> 23:01.914
Plus, kids are no guarantee
in that department.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.983
I mean, are you guys
supporting your parents?

23:03.983 --> 23:05.918
Woof, not on
a teacher's salary.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.587
Just because
you don't have kids

23:07.587 --> 23:09.456
doesn't mean you won't
have kids in your life.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.091
I mean, you could be
godparents or foster parents,

23:12.091 --> 23:14.226
or you could help support
your nieces and nephews.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.729
Durph is gonna
need help with that.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.097
Dude is super fertile.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.499
(Durph laughing)

23:19.499 --> 23:22.168
If you really wanna have kids,
that is great.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.270
But there's no reason
you have to.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.939
There is such a thing
as a happy, fulfilled,

23:26.939 --> 23:28.608
no-baby life.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.010
And that's something we all
need to give more credit.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.646
So... what is the test
going to say?

23:33.646 --> 23:35.114
I don't know the future.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.949
I just wanted you guys
to know that,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.451
no matter what the test says,

23:38.451 --> 23:40.487
you're gonna be okay.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.855
So we might
actually be...

23:42.855 --> 23:44.457
(wind whooshing)

23:46.493 --> 23:48.127
(Emily)
Not pregnant.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.764
Okay.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.765
Okay.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.703
I can live with that.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.871
Yeah... we can wait.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.172
Yeah.

24:00.172 --> 24:03.142
And, since we're not gonna
have a baby right now,

24:03.142 --> 24:04.844
maybe we should go travel.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.513
Or maybe we could
get another cat.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.280
(gasps)
Ooh, or we could keep up

24:08.280 --> 24:10.817
naked jujitsu Fridays.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.821
Thanks, Adam.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.155
Oh, and hey...

24:16.155 --> 24:18.024
Yeah?

24:18.024 --> 24:19.726
Don't ever make me
give birth again.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.730
My perineum...
shht!

24:24.831 --> 24:26.499
Like tissue paper.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.535
Won't happen again!

24:28.535 --> 24:29.902
Bye, friends!

24:32.404 --> 24:34.507
(sighs)

24:34.507 --> 24:36.709
Whoop, just got
my period.
