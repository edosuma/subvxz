20:25.311 --> 20:26.964
You know, the whole thing
was her idea?

20:27.008 --> 20:28.705
- What whole thing?

20:28.749 --> 20:30.620
- Maria was complaining
we were too loud,

20:30.664 --> 20:32.535
so Lexi tried
to loosen her up,

20:32.579 --> 20:33.928
starting dancing with her,

20:33.971 --> 20:35.756
had me give her drugs,

20:35.799 --> 20:37.279
turning her out like a pro.

got into the freezer?

20:43.677 --> 20:45.679

20:45.722 --> 20:46.767
All right, this year?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.464
People have lost their minds.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.119
Maybe she and Lexi
got into a fight

20:51.162 --> 20:54.731
when Maria realized Lexi
gave away all her stuff.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.690
Man, I should've known.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.304
- How much of this
did Lexi tell you?

21:02.348 --> 21:03.610
- She's a mess, but I don't
think she's good for--

21:03.653 --> 21:05.568
- Rollins.
- I know what you're thinking.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.004
- How much?

21:07.048 --> 21:10.007
- Not a word.

21:11.182 --> 21:14.011
- Put her in interrogation.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.977
- Look,
I didn't mention this before,

21:23.020 --> 21:25.153

21:25.196 --> 21:26.981
There was cash missing;

21:27.024 --> 21:28.374
the medicine cabinet
was cleaned out.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.376
- He told us you gave him that
to pay for the drugs.

21:30.419 --> 21:33.640
- What?
No, he robbed us.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.337
He must've killed Maria!

It's the only thing
that makes sense!

21:39.689 --> 21:41.517
Don't you believe me?

21:41.561 --> 21:42.953
- To be honest, Lexi,

21:42.997 --> 21:45.086
I'm just trying to reconcile

21:45.129 --> 21:47.218
Sean's story with yours

21:47.262 --> 21:48.350
because they are
very different.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.265
- What's he saying?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.441
- He saying this whole thing
was your idea.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.574
That you made him
give Maria drugs.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.445
- They were weed gummies.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.229
- Yeah, well, there was more
than weed in her system, Lexi.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.448
How did it get there?

21:59.492 --> 22:02.016
- Sean's edibles
must've had opium in them!

22:02.059 --> 22:03.496
I don't even remember
what happened!

22:03.539 --> 22:05.324

suggesting a three-way?

22:05.367 --> 22:07.456
- What?
No!

22:07.500 --> 22:08.762
That's what he's saying?

22:08.805 --> 22:11.547
- Yes, he said that you
initiated the three-way.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.462
And you know what else he said?

22:13.506 --> 22:15.421
He said Maria was fine

22:15.464 --> 22:16.770
when he left.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.338
- This is your last chance

22:19.381 --> 22:21.383

22:21.427 --> 22:23.167

22:23.211 --> 22:26.083

22:30.000 --> 22:31.524
I don't know

22:31.567 --> 22:32.699
- Well, you were fine

22:32.742 --> 22:35.441
- I told you,
I was making bad choices!

22:35.484 --> 22:37.573
- Did that include murder?

22:37.617 --> 22:39.183
- Wow.

22:39.227 --> 22:41.577
