00:02.419 --> 00:04.505
Previously on 90210:
Adrianna, what's wrong with you?

00:04.630 --> 00:05.714
You can't go out there
like this.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.257
Of course I can.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.550
Annie, you're up.
Change out of that costume.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.093
Put on Adrianna's.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.428
Mom, it's not just

00:11.553 --> 00:13.096
a casual fling with her and Dad.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.265
He's moving her
into the beach house.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.265
What?

00:16.391 --> 00:17.518
Give me a break!

00:17.643 --> 00:19.186
You are never gonna be happy
with somebody else

00:19.311 --> 00:20.187
because you're still

00:20.312 --> 00:22.147
in love with Dylan,
and you know it!

00:22.272 --> 00:23.524
So, you think more
about the party after?

00:23.649 --> 00:26.193
In your hotel room?

00:26.318 --> 00:27.361
Ty's in the shower.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.612
In the shower?

00:28.737 --> 00:30.322
Rinsing off.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.073
He didn't tell you
to meet him here,
too, did he?

00:33.325 --> 00:35.202
♪ ♪

00:39.623 --> 00:41.458
Here's the thing, Adrianna.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.670
If you have a problem
and you let us know now,

00:44.795 --> 00:46.588
then there are options.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.674
I don't know
what Miss Walsh told you,

00:48.799 --> 00:50.634
but all I did was
take some cough medicine

00:50.759 --> 00:52.219
to preserve my voice.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.721
Which is something
She's been doing

00:53.846 --> 00:56.807
since she won the Miss Sunburst
Beauty Pageant at age six.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.893
I don't know what you were on,

00:59.018 --> 01:00.268
but you were on
more than just

01:00.394 --> 01:01.687
cough syrup, and you know it.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.814
Do you have proof of that?

01:03.939 --> 01:06.316
Okay, this is not just
about Adrianna's behavior

01:06.441 --> 01:07.484
the night of the play.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.110
Her attendance this year
has been terrible;

01:09.236 --> 01:11.572
she shows up late
and exhausted;

01:11.697 --> 01:12.573
her eyes are red...

01:12.698 --> 01:13.908
Okay, you know what?

01:14.033 --> 01:16.702
I go to, like, five auditions
a week, so, yeah,

01:16.827 --> 01:19.580
I'm a little tired, but that
doesn't mean I'm on drugs.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.789
Well, maybe it's time to think
about pulling back

01:20.915 --> 01:21.665
on the acting a little bit.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.250
Well, maybe it's time

01:23.375 --> 01:24.710
you think
about lightening her workload.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.420
That's not gonna happen.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.421
Adrianna, you are

01:27.546 --> 01:28.672
a fantastic actress.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.840
And if you choose to,

01:29.965 --> 01:31.550
you're gonna have great success,

01:31.675 --> 01:33.594
but there's plenty
of time for that.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.345
Maybe you should take
a little bit of pressure

01:35.470 --> 01:36.555
off of yourself right now.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.892
Do you really think
I want to end up like you,

01:40.017 --> 01:43.395
acting in some tragic
theater company, (scoffs)

01:43.520 --> 01:45.773
directing high school musicals
in my spare time?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.399
No, thanks.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.985
Adrianna, this is the
one and only time

01:50.110 --> 01:51.319
we're gonna offer you
this solution.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.947
If we find out
that you're using

01:53.072 --> 01:54.615
unprescribed or
illegal drugs,

01:54.740 --> 01:56.324
we'll have no choice
but to expel you.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.578
You people

01:59.703 --> 02:01.538
are unbelievable.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.790
Isn't it enough

02:02.915 --> 02:04.583
you embarrassed her
in front of the

02:04.708 --> 02:06.167
entire school,
not to mention

02:06.293 --> 02:08.336
half a dozen
industry executives?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.298
Adrianna does not use drugs.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.883
If you try
to imply otherwise,

02:13.008 --> 02:16.177
I'll sue.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.679
Come on, baby.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.973
Let's go.

02:35.614 --> 02:36.782
Good job.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.450
You were amazing, Annie.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.827
You were so good.

02:39.952 --> 02:43.288
Oh, my God, it's like
you were performing just for me.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.748
Nice job, Ty.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.458
GIRL:
Good job, Annie.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.793
(students applauding)

02:47.918 --> 02:49.920
Annie, we need to talk.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.797
No, we don't. In fact, I think

02:51.922 --> 02:55.634
it'd be best if you just
never spoke to me again ever.

02:55.759 --> 02:56.718
I don't get you.

02:56.844 --> 02:57.886
You don't get me?

02:58.012 --> 02:59.888
It's a joke.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.724
Annie, please, just...

03:02.850 --> 03:04.351
(exasperated sigh)

03:04.476 --> 03:06.227
Oh! I'm sorry.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.354
Yeah, right.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.565
You're the girl who took
Adrianna's part.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.192
ADRIANNA:
Principal Wilson's
daughter.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.404
It's all starting
to make sense now, isn't it?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.698
Yep.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.450
God, what is her problem?!

03:20.575 --> 03:21.994
She is having
a rough time.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.328
Yeah, but so is
everybody else.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.454
It's called "high school."

03:24.579 --> 03:25.998
I'm just saying
it might be easier

03:26.123 --> 03:28.333
if you can find a way
to be the bigger person

03:28.458 --> 03:29.334
where she is concerned.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.712
Oh.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.220
My mom said she read
in some cougar blog that

03:40.345 --> 03:42.514
apparently, young guys
like the "trick"
with the Altoids.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.807
Oh, wow.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.100
I live in a nightmare.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.560
I mean, my parents
are acting like

03:46.685 --> 03:48.353
20 years' worth of marriage
meant nothing.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.354
Sorry.
Don't.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.814
Don't what?

03:50.939 --> 03:52.357
Don't say you're sorry
like there's no hope.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.193
Your dad's the one
who said there's no hope.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.986
Only because Gail has him
under some kind of spell.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.072
I mean, the minute he got
in the same room with my mom,

03:58.197 --> 03:58.864
they ended up
in bed together.

03:58.989 --> 03:59.948
What does that tell you?

04:00.074 --> 04:01.742
That they're still horny.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.661
No, that they still have
feelings for each other.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.164
All I have to do
is get them back

04:07.288 --> 04:08.874
in the same place
at the same time.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.584
How are you gonna do that?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.630
Um, I kind of have to cancel
our dinner plans.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.630
Is that okay?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.925
Why?
(phone beeps on)

04:18.050 --> 04:20.677
'Cause I have dinner plans

04:20.802 --> 04:21.928
with Daddy and his mistress.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.599
Hello, kitten.
Daddy?

04:25.724 --> 04:28.018
And what about Bill Fontaine?
I mean,

04:28.143 --> 04:29.603
is he still in Milan?

04:29.728 --> 04:33.314
Figures. Well, see if
you can get him anyway.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.610
And send me a list of everybody
who's stateside and available.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.986
Thank you.

04:39.654 --> 04:43.324
Antonio is...
is everything okay?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.535
No. The Pacific Coast
Fashion Show's

04:45.660 --> 04:47.370
one of my biggest jobs
of the year,

04:47.495 --> 04:50.124
and my #2 photographer's
just... pulled out.

04:50.249 --> 04:54.335
Oh, and you can't shoot an
entire runway show by yourself?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.503
And everyone I ever worked with

04:55.629 --> 04:56.922
is either booked
or out of the country.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.843
Antonio...

05:01.969 --> 05:03.845
maybe I could work
the show with you.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.513
I mean,
you said yourself

05:05.639 --> 05:06.765
I did a great job

05:06.890 --> 05:08.349
with the Los Angeles Magazine
spread.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.851
Debbie, thanks,
but this type of shoot,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.686
it's, it's rough work,
even for veterans.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.772
Tough angles,
difficult light...

05:13.897 --> 05:14.856
I wouldn't offer

05:14.982 --> 05:16.817
if I didn't think
I was 100% ready.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.568
I know how important

05:18.693 --> 05:19.903
this job is to you.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.741
The models come later today
for camera tests.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.701
Let's just...

05:26.827 --> 05:28.162
see how that goes,
and we'll take it from there.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.455
You won't be sorry.
I promise.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.417
(quietly):
Yes!

05:40.632 --> 05:42.383
I can't believe this.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.886
What?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.596
Dude, you've been
in Beverly Hills,
like, ten minutes

05:46.721 --> 05:47.472
and you're already
have a girlfriend.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.389
You know what
that makes me?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.850
A loser?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.101
No, a third wheel.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.560
See, this is why you don't go

05:52.686 --> 05:53.895
befriending
the new kid,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.605
because they're always gonna
be your friend until this.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.983
Wow. Needy much?
Whoa...

05:58.108 --> 06:00.861
I mean, is this like
a bona fide mid-teen
breakdown right now?

06:00.986 --> 06:02.321
All I'm saying

06:02.445 --> 06:03.655
is that I refuse
to be the third wheel.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.739
Are we clear?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.158
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.909
Yes, listen, I'm gonna let
you guys just hug this out

06:08.035 --> 06:09.661
while I go try to blog
Navid a whole new wheel.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.662
Please don't do that.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.830
Hey, the only thing worse

06:11.955 --> 06:12.831
than a third wheel

06:12.956 --> 06:13.832
is a fully exposed

06:13.957 --> 06:15.167
squeaky one, okay?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.376
Ugh, yeah, it's just
kind of what I do.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.882
Later.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.382
Silver, I'm serious.

06:25.052 --> 06:25.844
Dude, what the hell?

06:25.969 --> 06:27.762
Touch me again.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.931
So what do you think
is up next for Adrianna?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.267
Well, honestly, uh,
rehab at Promises.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.728
Maybe a mug shot
on Perez Hilton.
I don't know.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.231
Really, how do you relate
to a child actor

06:37.356 --> 06:39.107
who probably peaked
at age 14?

06:39.233 --> 06:41.568
It's a shame it had
to go this way, Brenda,

06:41.693 --> 06:42.861
'cause it really seemed

06:42.986 --> 06:44.946
like you were getting through
to her during the play.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.698
Maybe if I had
just let her go on,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.033
none of this would
be happening.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.159
No, you did the right thing.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.119
I saw her that night, too,

06:51.245 --> 06:52.204
and something
is definitely up.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.914
Or maybe she's
telling the truth.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.957
I mean, maybe it really
is just a classic case

06:56.083 --> 06:57.625
of militant stage mom

06:57.751 --> 06:58.793
meets one-too-many hits
of Robitussin.

06:58.919 --> 06:59.961
On a lighter note,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.713
what's next for Brenda Walsh?

07:01.838 --> 07:04.674
Well, tonight is our final
performance at the Taper,

07:04.799 --> 07:07.386
so I'm thinking, afterwards,
a glass of chardonnay

07:07.510 --> 07:08.803
and a hot bath
sounds about right.
(phone ringing)

07:08.929 --> 07:10.680
What about you two?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.140
Oh, well, I was hoping
I'd take this one to dinner.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.516
Hello?
What do you say, Kels?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.185
Tonight the night?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.644
Uh...
Hi.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.812
What's the matter?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.856
It's Dylan.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.277
Where is he?

07:24.819 --> 07:26.196
He says Wyoming.

07:27.906 --> 07:28.990
Yeah, well,

07:29.116 --> 07:31.451
um, actually,
I'm here with Kel now.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.079
Okay.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.705
He wants to talk to you.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.879
Hello?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.089
Uh, who's Dylan?

07:44.214 --> 07:46.883
Sammy's dad.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.219
Yeah.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.079
Don't forget your "Future
Enterpriser" assignments

08:16.204 --> 08:17.705
are due next week.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.625
Five pages detailing
your research on any career

08:20.750 --> 08:23.170
in any industry
that interests you.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.922
No, Adrianna, you can't do
the paper on yourself.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.216
(laughter,
school bell rings)

08:32.971 --> 08:36.183
Annie, what's your plan
for the assignment?

08:36.308 --> 08:37.558
Um, my mom's taking pictures

08:37.683 --> 08:38.934
at the Pacific Coast
Fashion Show.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.229
Dixon and I are gonna be
her assistants, so I thought

08:41.355 --> 08:42.688
I could write about that.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.857
You, uh, think
your mom could use

08:43.982 --> 08:44.774
a third helper?

08:44.899 --> 08:45.942
Um...

08:46.067 --> 08:47.735
Thanks, I don't need
your charity.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.862
No, what you need

08:48.987 --> 08:50.864
is a B or higher
on this assignment to keep

08:50.989 --> 08:51.948
from failing my class.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.703
Fine.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.163
Yeah, we are leaving

08:58.288 --> 09:00.040
right after school
for my mom's studio,

09:00.165 --> 09:01.124
and if you're late,
we're leaving without you.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.543
Good, then it's settled.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.296
Have you lost your mind?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.965
I want nothing to do with you.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.260
No, if anybody gets to have a
problem here, it's me with you.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.012
Oh, are you serious?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.181
You stole my part in the play.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.224
Adrianna,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.393
I was your understudy.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.019
I had to go on.
You, on the other hand,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.271
did not need to sleep with Ty.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.731
Then why are you helping me?

09:24.856 --> 09:25.899
Because

09:26.024 --> 09:29.027
unlike you,
I'm actually a nice person.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.578
Kind of ran off
there. You okay?

09:39.954 --> 09:40.997
Kelly?

09:41.122 --> 09:44.125
Oh, yeah, sorry.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.335
Brenda filled me in

09:45.460 --> 09:47.170
on the whole Dylan saga.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.089
Thought he was supposed
to be off saving the world.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.925
Uh, well, he said
he was tired of traveling.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.760
He wants to come back home.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.387
But not to you and Sammy.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.014
Not to Beverly Hills, at least.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.434
He wants me and Sammy with him.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.478
Guess a romantic dinner with me
is kind of out.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.982
Ryan...

10:08.108 --> 10:10.818
Look, you are
a really great guy.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.072
I mean it. Any girl would
be lucky to have a chance

10:14.197 --> 10:15.615
with someone like you,
but with things

10:15.740 --> 10:19.202
the way they are with Dylan,
I just don't know if or when

10:19.327 --> 10:21.871
I'm gonna be able to go there
with somebody else,

10:21.996 --> 10:24.665
and you deserve more than that.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.419
Are you asking me to wait?

10:27.544 --> 10:29.254
'Cause I got
nothing but time

10:29.379 --> 10:30.838
and the distinct feeling

10:30.964 --> 10:32.840
that women like you don't
come around very often.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.806
I don't want you to wait.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.184
I'm sorry.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.187
Me, too.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.609
Hey, uh, Kelly,

10:50.733 --> 10:52.944
do you have your phone
with you today?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.362
Yeah. Why?

10:54.488 --> 10:58.366
I was just wondering,
if Dylan wanted to talk to you,

10:58.492 --> 11:00.660
why was he calling Brenda?

11:08.126 --> 11:11.004
ERIN:
It's not that I don't want
to go with you,

11:11.129 --> 11:14.549
it's just... I reject
the unrealistic expectations

11:14.673 --> 11:17.218
the modeling industry
pushes on average women.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.179
And I totally agree.
(laughs)

11:19.304 --> 11:20.847
I totally don't believe you.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.183
(laughs): Look, it's not
like I'm not interested

11:23.308 --> 11:25.268
in seeing runway models
in their underwear,

11:25.393 --> 11:27.061
because that would be a lie.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.813
I would like that,
a lot, actually.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.273
(laughs):
Okay,

11:30.398 --> 11:32.317
if you're still trying
to convince me to go,

11:32.442 --> 11:34.319
you are failing miserably.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.862
Check it,
I figured out

11:35.987 --> 11:36.863
a solution

11:36.988 --> 11:37.905
to our third-wheel problem.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.574
Uh...

11:39.698 --> 11:41.409
Dude, that's your problem,
not our problem.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.036
But you guys are still going
to the fashion show,

11:43.161 --> 11:44.245
aren't you?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.288
How about

11:45.413 --> 11:46.498
you let me tag along?

11:46.623 --> 11:50.084
Isn't tagging along
the essence

11:50.210 --> 11:52.212
of the third-wheel problem?
Not if I'm not alone;
if I bring somebody,

11:52.337 --> 11:53.838
then we'll have all four wheels

11:53.963 --> 11:55.507
on the same track, fully loaded.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.051
Oh, all right, all right.
So who are you bringing?

11:58.176 --> 12:00.220
Uh, well, that's where
you come into play.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.055
You know, after the epic
flame-out with Ty,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.265
I figured
I'd take a shot at Annie.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.933
What do you think?
(laughs)

12:06.059 --> 12:07.060
What do I think?
Yeah.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.228
I think that's going

12:08.353 --> 12:09.688
in the "Never Gonna Happen"
pile. No.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.190
Why? She's hot.
I'm hot. We're bros.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.608
It makes perfect sense.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.610
Don't make me drop you
in the lunch line, bro.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.613
Thanks, man.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.618
Looking for this?

12:23.742 --> 12:26.413
I borrowed it for my lunch date
this afternoon.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.164
Your lunch date?
With who?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.916
Mr. Wellington.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.501
Dad's investment guy?

12:31.626 --> 12:33.503
Hello? He's gay.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.962
Yeah, well, I know that now.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.340
He spent the entire lunch
talking about

12:37.465 --> 12:40.260
his partner, William,
and I thought he meant
business partner,

12:40.385 --> 12:44.097
until he whips out his pictures
from his cruise to Barcelona.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.057
Nice, Mom.
Yeah.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.059
It's just as well.
I really don't know
what I was thinking.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.103
Do you want to get some
takeout from Mr. Chow's?

12:50.228 --> 12:52.272
Oh, no, Daddy's taking me
to dinner at the Marina Club.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.941
Oh. Well, that
sounds nice.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.403

tan, young runway models?

Naomi, how bad do you want me
to feel about myself?

13:17.422 --> 13:19.006
I didn't mean that.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.342
I meant, you're beautiful

Thank you, sweetheart.
Of course.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.707
We all know you're not exactly

15:15.832 --> 15:17.751
the world's greatest
communicator, Daddy.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.502
I was worried I might not get
to know your girlfriend

15:19.627 --> 15:21.337
if I didn't take the lead.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.382
Obviously, my dad's legendary
secrecy isn't news to you.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.259
Actually, Charles and I
have always

15:26.384 --> 15:27.427
talked openly
about everything.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.262
Oh, well, then you know
what a workaholic he is.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.972
I mean, expect him to be gone
most nights and weekends,

15:32.098 --> 15:33.433
and lots of business trips.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.436
It's been like that
since way before you guys met.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.354
Or is that how you guys met?
Actually,
Gail and I

15:38.479 --> 15:40.523
met in line at a gelato stand
in Century City.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.110
Mm? That's so cute!

15:44.235 --> 15:46.279
I didn't even know
you liked gelato, Daddy.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.698
Must be one of his
dirty little secrets.
Sweetheart,

15:48.823 --> 15:50.199
I know what you're trying to do,

15:50.324 --> 15:52.285
and it's not
going to work.

there is to know about me.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.290

Oh, well, that is

15:57.415 --> 15:58.499
truly amazing.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.959
How are you handling

16:00.084 --> 16:02.336
the current situation
with him and my mom?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.464
You must be a saint
to allow them

16:04.589 --> 16:08.718
to keep their own "lines
of communication" flowing.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.637
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.764
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I just...

16:12.889 --> 16:15.683
figured since you and my dad
were so open and honest

16:15.809 --> 16:17.435
that he would have told you

16:17.560 --> 16:18.686
that he and my mom

16:18.812 --> 16:20.020
are still sleeping together.

22:38.316 --> 22:40.693
but I told him that he was
already messing up,

22:40.818 --> 22:43.112
and that if he was serious
about reconnecting with you,

22:43.237 --> 22:44.613
he needed to come back
to the States

22:44.738 --> 22:45.739
and do it the right way.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.450

so many times,

22:48.575 --> 22:50.161

to protect you.

Yeah.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.289
Did you tell me to
be nice to Adrianna

27:45.414 --> 27:46.706
because you wanted proof

27:46.832 --> 27:48.334
she was using drugs?
No! Of, of course not.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.252
I would never put you
in that position.
Yeah.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.795
Well, she thinks I
was spying for you.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.130
She's probably
texting every number

27:53.255 --> 27:54.923
in her Sidekick
as we speak.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.425
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Yeah. Thanks.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.888
What is so important that
I had to meet you here?

28:02.014 --> 28:02.973
Ethan.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.058
Where'd she go?

28:05.184 --> 28:05.976
Where did who go?

28:09.396 --> 28:11.898
You gotta be kidding me.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.985
Young lady, what
are you up to?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.153
Charles.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.404
What are you doing here?

28:17.530 --> 28:19.031
I received an
urgent text message

28:19.156 --> 28:20.115
from your daughter
saying that

28:20.240 --> 28:21.783
there was an
emergency here.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.118
Now I see she was lying.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.411
I wasn't lying.

28:24.537 --> 28:25.454
TRACY:
Would you explain this

28:25.579 --> 28:27.289
to those of us
who have no idea

28:27.414 --> 28:28.207
what you're
talking about.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.333
Uh, we were set up.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.792
Set up?

28:30.917 --> 28:33.253
Clearly, Naomi expected
me to come in here,

28:33.379 --> 28:35.506
find you in the arms of
your ridiculous companions

28:35.631 --> 28:37.757
and whisk you off
in a jealous rage.

28:37.883 --> 28:38.884
Is this true, Naomi?

28:39.009 --> 28:40.302
Did you really
just invite me here

28:40.427 --> 28:42.054
as some sort of game?

28:42.179 --> 28:43.514
No, this wasn't
some sort of game.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.266
I just wanted you guys
to give your marriage a chance.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.893
I figured
if you were together...

28:48.018 --> 28:49.311
We are not
together, Naomi.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.438
Your mother and I will
never be together.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.232
Charles...

28:53.357 --> 28:54.900
you don't have
to be cruel.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.235
No, I have tried
the civil route,

28:56.360 --> 28:57.695
and it didn't work.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.154
You'll accept that
this marriage is over,

28:59.279 --> 29:00.739
and we can all move on
with our lives.

29:10.708 --> 29:13.252
I hope you and Gail
are happy together.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.966
Looks like this party's
really kicking into high gear.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.219
Yeah, I never should
have gotten involved.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.763
Hey, you know, you were
just trying to help.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.641
I think I may get out of town
for a little bit, you know?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.935
Take a break from acting,
recalibrate.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.062
Any idea what you might do?

29:32.187 --> 29:34.523
Might go visit my brother
Brandon and his family.

29:34.648 --> 29:35.982
I didn't know
you had a brother.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.318
There's a lot that
you don't know about me,

29:38.444 --> 29:40.613
and it's probably better
that it stays that way.

29:40.738 --> 29:44.366
I'm heading in your direction
if you want a ride.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.118
How do you know
where I'm heading?

29:46.243 --> 29:48.036
I don't.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.583
Let's go.

29:56.629 --> 30:00.299
Now, I thought the modeling
world was not for you.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.760
(sighs)
Morbid fascination.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.971
I was dragged here
kicking and screaming.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.431
You know how you can tell

30:07.556 --> 30:08.890
when one of these girls
are really special?

30:09.015 --> 30:12.519
You catch them in
their everyday life.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.020
I discovered
Rebecca Romijn

30:14.146 --> 30:17.149
in a supermarket
in Santa Cruz.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.692
Seriously?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.694
Mm-hmm. I was
also the first to

30:20.819 --> 30:22.613
see the potential
in Heidi as well.

30:22.738 --> 30:26.408
You know, you've got
the exact same thing they have.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.368
Oh, really. What's that?

30:28.494 --> 30:30.537
Me backing you.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.038
All you need now
is an agent

30:32.164 --> 30:34.541
and a stylist
and a portfolio.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.002
But I can help
you with that.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.505
But if you're not interested...

30:42.174 --> 30:44.551
How about I get my driver
to take us back

30:44.677 --> 30:46.303
to my house
in the hills,

30:46.428 --> 30:47.971
and we can plot
the world domination

30:48.096 --> 30:50.307
of Silver in my Jacuzzi?

30:50.432 --> 30:51.308
You're kidding, right?

30:51.433 --> 30:52.559
Do you know

30:52.685 --> 30:54.144
how old I am?

30:54.269 --> 30:55.562
Oh, age, to me,
is more of a state of mind.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.189
Yeah, well,

30:57.314 --> 31:00.066
in the state of California,
it's 15 to 20 hard time.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.655
Look, you're obviously
a very smart girl,

31:04.780 --> 31:06.490
and this is
a once-in-a-lifetime

31:06.615 --> 31:08.325
opportunity, so

31:08.450 --> 31:09.409
why don't you think
about all the good

31:09.535 --> 31:11.077
the money could do?

31:11.203 --> 31:13.455
Don't.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.415
Get your hands off her!

31:15.541 --> 31:17.751
Dixon, what are you doing?!

31:17.876 --> 31:20.086
Who the hell is this thug?
Security!

31:20.212 --> 31:23.590
This young man
is my son.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.259
Oh, really?
And who the baby daddy?

31:26.385 --> 31:28.387
Excuse me, Mom.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.930
DEBBIE:
Dixon! Oh!

31:31.056 --> 31:33.350
Get... get off!
Get... get off me!

31:33.475 --> 31:34.351
Oh! Oh!

31:34.476 --> 31:35.268
Hey!

31:35.394 --> 31:36.520
Knock it off.

31:36.645 --> 31:37.270
Back off!
Hey.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.438
Hey.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.481
What the hell is
the matter with you?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.107
ANTONIO:
Debbie?

31:41.233 --> 31:42.609
What's going on here?
What's going on

31:42.735 --> 31:45.278
is this protégé of yours
and her little

31:45.404 --> 31:46.363
Compton kid
Compton...

31:46.488 --> 31:48.532
just lost you
your biggest account.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.328
You're fired.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.213
(clears throat)

32:03.338 --> 32:05.215
Hey.
Hey.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.217
You okay?

32:07.342 --> 32:09.469
No.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.471
I'm an idiot.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.516
Do you know I...

32:14.641 --> 32:16.435
actually almost started
believing that guy.
Hey, hey.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.729
That guy is a pig.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.022
But he was right
about one thing.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.066
You are definitely

32:23.191 --> 32:25.736
the most beautiful girl
in the room tonight.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.126
Thank you.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.673
Let me take you home,
all right?

32:48.717 --> 32:51.678
(laughter)

32:51.804 --> 32:53.138
NAVID: That was at
Palisades High.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.223
It's is like,
"We found pigs 1, 2, and 4,

32:55.348 --> 32:56.558
"but where the hell is 3?

32:56.683 --> 32:57.601
"We've looked everywhere,

32:57.726 --> 32:59.060
and we can't find
the fourth pig."

32:59.185 --> 33:01.855
But the joke was,
there was only three pigs.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.357
We just numbered them
1, 2, and 4.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.568
(laughs)

33:06.693 --> 33:07.653
Yeah, I don't get it.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.279
There was no fourth pig.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.989
But then what happened
to pig number three?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.453
Hey.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.621
Ty.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.665
What are you doing here?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.667
I got a text from Adrianna

33:21.792 --> 33:23.251
about an hour ago.
Oh.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.503
She told me about what happened
at The Roosevelt.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.463
Yeah.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.465
Looks like we
were set up.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.217
Yeah, lots of that
going on around here.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.636
Look,

33:32.761 --> 33:34.387
I'm sorry.
About what?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.139
Even with Adrianna
standing there

33:36.264 --> 33:37.641
in that towel,

33:37.766 --> 33:39.309
I knew you weren't
that kind of guy,

33:39.434 --> 33:40.602
I should have trusted
my instincts.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.522
Yeah. You should have.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.942
You know, I went to the hotel

33:47.066 --> 33:48.401
that night, thinking
it was going to be

33:48.527 --> 33:50.153
the night for us.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.614
There's other nights,
other hotels.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.407
Yeah, not... not for me.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.576
Not yet.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.286
I'm just not ready.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.830
God, this town really

33:59.955 --> 34:01.331
messes with your head,
doesn't it?

34:01.456 --> 34:02.708
Well...

34:02.833 --> 34:05.168
you've always got a friend
with me.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.879
If you need one.

34:07.921 --> 34:10.382
I think that might be exactly

34:10.507 --> 34:12.425
what I need right now.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.302
Friends it is.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.650
(under breath):
God...

34:32.237 --> 34:33.947
Antonio, I'm so sorry.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.282
If you want to fire me,
I totally understand.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.324
Ah, please.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.493
You were defending your son.

34:38.618 --> 34:39.828
Life's too short

34:39.953 --> 34:41.496
to work with people
like that.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.581
And you're too talented
not to keep around.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.375
Thank you.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.252
Thank you.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.590
He did not fire you?
No.

34:51.715 --> 34:52.799
(sighs)

34:52.925 --> 34:54.175
Hey, is Dixon okay?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.217
Yeah, I gave him

34:55.342 --> 34:56.386
Grandma's Mercedes.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.888
He is taking Silver home.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.556
Where's Annie
and Adrianna?

34:59.681 --> 35:01.433
That is a whole
other story.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.311
Can we get out
of here already?

35:06.479 --> 35:07.731
(sighs)

35:07.856 --> 35:10.400
I will fill you in
on the way home.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.568
Every time I try to fix it.

35:11.693 --> 35:12.861
Every time.

35:12.986 --> 35:13.946
I should have just
listened to you.

35:14.071 --> 35:15.196
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.198
I just wanted everything
to be the same

35:17.323 --> 35:20.118
before... before all this drama.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.164
Now my parents
will never get back together.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.583
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

35:26.708 --> 35:27.960
How can you say that?

35:31.379 --> 35:34.841
Some people just...

35:34.967 --> 35:36.301
aren't meant to be together.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.177
That's all.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.598
They were together, Ethan.

35:41.723 --> 35:42.808
That's the point.

35:42.933 --> 35:43.850
That doesn't mean anything.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.852
Sex always means something.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.437
It says there's still some

35:47.562 --> 35:49.355
feelings, connection,
emotion.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.149
It's that way with us, right?

35:53.359 --> 35:55.528
Right?

35:55.654 --> 35:56.863
Not always.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.491
Wow.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.829
So is that why you couldn't say
you loved me earlier?

36:06.414 --> 36:07.582
It's complicated.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.251
It shouldn't be complicated, E.

36:10.376 --> 36:14.172
I'm just so tired.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.968
I'm tired of pretending

36:18.093 --> 36:20.804
that my parents are
gonna be together forever.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.140
I'm tired of pretending

36:23.264 --> 36:25.851
that we're ultimately
gonna stay together.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.776
I think it's over, E.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.903
For good, this time.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.910
I think you're right.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.635
Hey, kiddo.
How was the party?
Hey.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.970
Oh, you know.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.930
Dreams built up and shattered.

37:04.056 --> 37:04.973
Typical night in Hollywood.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.599
I'm sorry. Is he awake?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.476
I don't want to wake him up.
Oh, no.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.686
He's down for the count.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.688
We had a big day.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.733
What's up with
the suitcases?

37:14.858 --> 37:17.569
Well, Sam and I are going
to visit Dylan.

37:18.945 --> 37:22.115
Oh, my God.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.449
Are you gonna get back together
with him?

37:23.575 --> 37:25.368
No.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.038
And there is every possibility
that after this,

37:28.163 --> 37:30.040
Dylan may be out
of our lives for good,

37:30.165 --> 37:31.875
but I have to find out
one way or the other.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.002
I can't keep living in this
in-between place, you know?

37:34.127 --> 37:35.628
You actually think he's changed?

37:35.754 --> 37:38.381
There's one way to find out.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.634
Well, how long
are you gonna be gone?

37:41.760 --> 37:44.888
The school gave me
a two-week leave.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.348
And I talked to your dad.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.850
He has a room ready,
and he's waiting for you.

37:48.975 --> 37:52.020
You're kidding, right?

37:52.145 --> 37:55.232
I am not gonna go stay with Mel
and his latest child bride.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.775
I think that girl's actually
in my homeroom.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.236
Ugh, I don't know.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.238
Well, you can't stay with Mom.
That's for sure.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.656
And you're not going back
to that shelter.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.533
Uh, thought.

38:06.868 --> 38:07.994
Why don't I stay here?

38:08.120 --> 38:10.413
I can look
after your place,

38:10.538 --> 38:11.998
bring in your mail,

38:12.124 --> 38:13.583
pay your everything,
you know,

38:13.708 --> 38:14.918
water your flowers.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.419
Come on. My stuff's
already here anyways, so.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.546
Okay.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.173
Okay?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.841
Okay, yes, I think
you can handle it.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.009
Oh!

38:23.135 --> 38:24.928
Thanks!

38:25.053 --> 38:27.555
And... that means
you have to come back,

38:27.680 --> 38:29.348
right?

38:29.474 --> 38:31.017
With or without Dylan.

38:31.143 --> 38:34.062
Don't worry about it, okay?

38:34.187 --> 38:36.022
Silver, you and I are family.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.150
You'll never be alone.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.611
Come here.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.071
Thanks.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.363
I love you.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.865
I love you.
