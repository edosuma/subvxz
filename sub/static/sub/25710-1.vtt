00:45.525 --> 00:47.565
Okay, I'll fire her up.

00:49.085 --> 00:52.725
I see you downloaded the new maps. Cool.
You got any weed?

00:52.805 --> 00:54.725
- What... what are you doing?
- Don't you have another controller?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.165
No, I meant what are you doing <i>here?</i>

00:56.245 --> 00:58.325
Oh, I got a cousin's wedding in Germany.

00:58.405 --> 01:00.005
Worked out cheaper

01:00.085 --> 01:01.565
if I stay here a couple
of nights in London.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.045
You know, didn't think you would, uh...

01:03.125 --> 01:04.685
Oh, shit!

01:04.765 --> 01:08.285
Dude! It was from here, wasn't it?
Holy mother of...

01:08.365 --> 01:09.925
Shh! Keep your voice down.

01:10.845 --> 01:12.045
What, is Becca sleeping?

01:12.125 --> 01:12.925
Not any more.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.325
Oh... Hello, darling.

01:16.885 --> 01:19.525
Yeah, babe, do you remember Will_5000?

01:19.605 --> 01:23.925
You know, that guy I play online with?
Well, he's come to stay for a few nights.

01:24.565 --> 01:28.045
That's funny. You think I'd remember
one of your friends who I've never met

01:28.125 --> 01:30.445
planning to arrive at my flat
in the middle of the night.

01:30.525 --> 01:34.285
Sorry. I kind of, um,
sprung it on Daniel. Yeah.

01:34.365 --> 01:35.365
Right.

01:35.885 --> 01:36.845
Okay.

01:37.485 --> 01:38.845
Welcome to our home.

01:39.525 --> 01:41.205
Thank you, Becca.

01:41.285 --> 01:44.205
And again, sorry. I know it's kinda late.

01:44.285 --> 01:47.365
No, no... it's... it's fine, um...

01:48.965 --> 01:50.645
Why didn't you tell me?

01:50.725 --> 01:53.605
Oh, look, he just turned up, okay?
I didn't know he was coming.

01:53.685 --> 01:55.085
What's wrong with his face?

01:55.645 --> 01:56.845
I don't know.

01:56.925 --> 01:58.645
It's the first time I've ever met him.

01:59.725 --> 02:01.805
Oh, he's not gonna need all this.

02:02.365 --> 02:03.605
It's not just for him.

02:15.405 --> 02:17.885
You never told me about the, er...

02:18.525 --> 02:19.725
- The mask?
- Mmm.

02:21.005 --> 02:22.605
Everyone wants to know about the mask.

02:23.565 --> 02:24.965
It's the cheapest one I could get.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.485
I'm saving up for surgery.

02:27.405 --> 02:29.445
So... what... what happened?

02:32.965 --> 02:34.365
I was eight years old.

02:35.605 --> 02:37.205
Mom had been ironing in our trailer.

02:38.285 --> 02:39.165
She left the iron on.

02:39.925 --> 02:42.325
I was standing on a stool,
reaching for the cookie jar.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.245
The stool gives way.

02:44.725 --> 02:47.005
I come down, bring the ironing board
down with me and...

02:48.045 --> 02:49.205
Fuck!

02:49.885 --> 02:52.045
- I'm sorry, man. That's...
- Well...

02:53.805 --> 02:56.405
At least it didn't land on my dick.

02:56.485 --> 02:57.485
Right?

02:58.045 --> 02:59.325
Fuck you, asshole!

02:59.405 --> 03:02.685
Ooh, can we just...?
Let's just keep it quiet.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.725
You saw that, right?

03:03.805 --> 03:06.405
I mean, I emptied a full fucking clip
into this guy, he doesn't go down.

03:06.485 --> 03:07.445
I mean, in what world?

03:07.525 --> 03:09.565
Do you know what?
I'm gonna try and get some sleep.

03:10.365 --> 03:11.245
Totally.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.365
I am so fucking jetlagged right now,

03:13.445 --> 03:15.845
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
for hours, you know.

03:17.645 --> 03:21.565
You motherfucker!
Suck my dick! Suck it!

03:23.965 --> 03:25.245
I wasn't sure at first,

03:25.325 --> 03:27.445
but I think that new haircut
takes years off you.

03:27.525 --> 03:28.885
Oh, thank you.

03:29.445 --> 03:33.245
And also, I'd like to officially thank you

03:33.325 --> 03:35.325
for agreeing to share our...

03:36.245 --> 03:37.925
our martial bed once again.

03:38.845 --> 03:39.885
And now...

03:41.205 --> 03:43.325
No, no, no, no, Iain.
I'm not quite ready for that, no.

03:43.405 --> 03:45.485
- Please!
- No, Iain. Soon, darling.

03:47.405 --> 03:50.725
Sorry. Make way!

03:52.285 --> 03:53.845
- Iain!
- I'm sorry.

03:55.005 --> 03:58.805
07700 900843.
Dr. Iain Glennis speaking.

03:58.885 --> 04:00.125
<i>Iain, it's Sherry.</i>

04:00.205 --> 04:01.885
Oh, hello, Sherry.

04:01.965 --> 04:04.845
<i>How would you and Mrs. G
like to join me and Mrs. S at the club?</i>

04:05.605 --> 04:06.685
Oh, yes.

04:06.765 --> 04:09.045
Yes, I'd like that very much.

04:09.645 --> 04:11.765
<i>Well, great. See you there at midday.</i>

04:11.845 --> 04:13.445
Yes. Goodbye.

04:14.685 --> 04:17.365
- Sherry?
- Yes, short for Sherringford.

04:18.084 --> 04:19.365
Sherringford?

04:19.445 --> 04:21.045
Yes. Sherringford Samson.

04:22.205 --> 04:23.845
He's just invited me

04:24.765 --> 04:27.005
and the most beautiful woman in the world

04:27.085 --> 04:31.525
to spend the afternoon with him
in his rather exclusive

04:31.605 --> 04:32.925
country club.

04:34.285 --> 04:36.445
Oh, Iain!

04:37.125 --> 04:38.365
- Oh!
- Oh.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.285
I'm just going to pick out my outfit.

04:43.405 --> 04:44.685
We have to clean the whole flat?

04:44.765 --> 04:46.885
Yes. I want it to look nice for Vanessa.

04:46.965 --> 04:49.085
Why would she come in the bedroom?

04:49.165 --> 04:51.205
- I'll get it!
- Thanks, Will!

04:51.285 --> 04:52.325
Because, you know...

04:56.765 --> 04:59.005
I'm really sorry.

04:59.365 --> 05:02.685
Please, Vanessa, stop apologizing.
I'm used to it.

05:02.765 --> 05:03.805
Okay.

05:03.885 --> 05:05.485
How are you feeling, Daniel?

05:06.645 --> 05:09.725
- You know, not too bad.
- Why, what's wrong?

05:12.245 --> 05:14.525
I'm sure...
I'm sure I told you about my...

05:15.405 --> 05:16.525
illness.

05:16.605 --> 05:18.765
Oh, right!

05:19.165 --> 05:20.245
God!

05:20.965 --> 05:22.645
And how are you, Vanessa?

05:23.445 --> 05:24.525
I'm okay.

05:25.765 --> 05:27.045
I lost my husband recently.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.685
Mmm. Ash, right?

05:29.365 --> 05:32.525
Daniel's other best friend.
He sounded like a cool dude.

05:32.605 --> 05:33.805
He was.

05:34.925 --> 05:36.405
I'm just starting to think...

05:37.365 --> 05:39.645
how well did I really know you, Ash?

05:40.925 --> 05:42.565
I found condoms in his wallet.

05:45.605 --> 05:47.645
We hadn't used condoms for ages.

05:47.725 --> 05:49.125
Well, maybe they were old ones.

05:49.765 --> 05:51.325
I still don't know where his car is.

05:52.965 --> 05:54.525
And now this thing with his phone.

05:55.245 --> 05:58.245
I can't get into it.
His code was always 2019.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.165
- Yeah.
- The same as yours.

06:00.245 --> 06:03.245
- Yeah, it was always that.
- The year <i>Blade Runner's</i> set. Very cool.

06:03.325 --> 06:06.245
But since I got it back from the hospital,
that code doesn't work.

06:08.405 --> 06:10.205
Oh, well, you know.

06:10.285 --> 06:14.565
Maybe it caught a virus from being
at the hospital.

06:16.885 --> 06:19.365
- That's not funny, Daniel.
- That is <i>not</i> cool, bro.

06:20.645 --> 06:23.725
Is there a way of getting into a phone
without knowing the code?

06:23.805 --> 06:25.885
Well, even the FBI
can't hack those things, Vanessa.

06:25.965 --> 06:28.565
Anyway, I have got some
excellent carob bars.

06:29.765 --> 06:33.125
Yeah! They're zero calories
and taste amazing.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.725
Please, Dad.

06:36.005 --> 06:39.445
It's a lovely day.
Your mother wouldn't be very happy

06:39.525 --> 06:41.165
if I took you to a dark cinema, would she?

06:41.685 --> 06:44.485
- But it's a classic!
- Maybe if it was <i>The Hunger Games,</i>

06:44.565 --> 06:46.045
but not <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

06:46.125 --> 06:47.205
You're 11.

06:52.205 --> 06:54.365
Put that in the dishwasher.

06:54.445 --> 06:55.525
Hello?

06:56.445 --> 06:58.805
Okay. Well, I'll get there
as soon as I can.

06:59.405 --> 07:02.005
Um... We're going to have to
take a trip into work.

07:02.085 --> 07:03.605
But it's Sunday.

07:03.685 --> 07:06.245
Well, I'm sorry, young lady,
but the alarm has gone off.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.725
Oh, so I'm not allowed to see
an acclaimed horror film,

07:08.805 --> 07:11.685
but I am allowed to be a security guard
for a health insurance firm?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.565
Can you just...

07:14.965 --> 07:16.485
...grow up?

07:18.245 --> 07:19.765
I wish we had a nicer car.

07:19.845 --> 07:21.925
What? This is an Audi, my darling.

07:22.005 --> 07:23.885
Yes, and it's bashed to pieces.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.565
Accidents can't be helped, can they?

07:25.645 --> 07:28.565
Yes, they can. You just need to
take more care, darling.

07:29.525 --> 07:32.645
I... I told you.
I was swerving to avoid a squirrel.

07:34.965 --> 07:37.085
So, where is Ash buried?

07:38.205 --> 07:39.565
He was cremated.

07:40.645 --> 07:45.565
I, um... I haven't scattered the ashes
yet. I just... I've not felt ready.

07:45.645 --> 07:46.765
I get that.

07:47.285 --> 07:48.565
So where did you guys meet?

07:49.645 --> 07:52.565
Funny enough, right here, in the garden.

07:53.325 --> 07:56.765
Daniel and Becca's barbecue,
three years ago.

07:59.565 --> 08:00.725
Down here?

08:00.805 --> 08:02.005
Uh... yes.

08:02.605 --> 08:05.125
It was a summer evening.

08:05.805 --> 08:08.125
He was wearing his Indiana Jones
T-shirt.

08:08.205 --> 08:09.325
Raiders?

08:10.045 --> 08:11.565
Uh... I guess.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.365
Vanessa, you should totally
scatter his ashes in the garden.

08:15.445 --> 08:16.685
Oh, Will!

08:17.205 --> 08:19.325
You heard what she said.
She's... she's not ready.

08:19.405 --> 08:21.805
No, he's right. I should.

08:22.325 --> 08:23.685
Do it today!

08:23.765 --> 08:26.205
Oh, it's a bit... Let's not rush her.

08:27.045 --> 08:28.485
Could we do it today?

08:29.365 --> 08:33.605
No. I think you need to get permission
from the council before you...

08:34.284 --> 08:35.725
scatter ashes in a...

08:35.804 --> 08:37.205
For God's sake, Daniel!

08:37.284 --> 08:38.684
Look, of course we can.

08:38.765 --> 08:40.684
I'll drive you back
and we can get the urn.

08:41.485 --> 08:42.605
Okay.

09:00.645 --> 09:01.805
He is dead.

09:07.165 --> 09:08.525
- Jesus!
- Hey.

09:08.605 --> 09:11.565
You scared the shit out of me.
Why did you suggest that to Vanessa?

09:11.645 --> 09:13.245
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.

09:13.645 --> 09:17.405
Well, we're gonna be scattering
his ashes where he landed.

09:17.885 --> 09:18.885
Shit!

09:18.965 --> 09:20.405
I didn't think. Forgive me.

09:20.925 --> 09:23.125
Just... think in future.

09:23.205 --> 09:24.365
Will do.

09:24.445 --> 09:28.125
So, what are you doing here?
Checking there's no sign of him?

09:29.245 --> 09:30.605
I'm just... just seeing

09:30.685 --> 09:32.445
- if I've missed anything.
- Hmm.

09:33.165 --> 09:34.845
Like, did you ever notice that?

09:36.645 --> 09:37.925
Oh, fuck!

09:39.805 --> 09:42.685
If there's any footage,
I'll need to delete it before he sees it.

09:43.485 --> 09:46.445
I'll create a diversion.
So, what's he like?

09:46.525 --> 09:47.645
A bit weird.

09:48.165 --> 09:50.085
Sometimes I see him
going through our bins.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.085
Plus there's...

09:53.365 --> 09:55.285
Cameras.

09:58.605 --> 10:00.285
Maybe he's not in.

10:01.045 --> 10:02.805
Hello! Anybody home?

10:02.885 --> 10:04.885
- We're not Jehovah's Witnesses!
- Will!

10:05.485 --> 10:07.325
See?

10:11.805 --> 10:13.165
What do you want?

10:13.245 --> 10:14.725
Hi.

10:15.325 --> 10:16.925
Sorry, I've completely forgotten
your name.

10:17.005 --> 10:18.125
It's Paul.

10:18.205 --> 10:19.605
Paul, yeah.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.725
Um, my drainpipe at the back of ours
has come loose

10:22.805 --> 10:25.645
and it looks like someone
might've tried to break in.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.605
Mmm. And maybe he fell into the garden.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.965
You have a security camera
pointing at our wall

10:32.045 --> 10:34.285
and I just thought you might have
some footage of what happened.

10:34.365 --> 10:35.645
I might.

10:37.325 --> 10:39.205
Right. Is there...?

10:39.285 --> 10:41.685
- Can we come in and...
- What's wrong with your face?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.325
- I was eight years old.
- Mmm?

10:46.885 --> 10:49.845
Mom had been ironing in our trailer.
She left the iron on.

10:49.925 --> 10:52.005
I was standing on a stool,
reaching for the cookie jar.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.405
The stool gave way, took the ironing board
down with me and...

10:56.525 --> 10:58.045
And... what?

11:00.005 --> 11:02.525
And... the iron fell on my face.

11:02.605 --> 11:03.845
Oh, right.

11:04.885 --> 11:08.085
As long as you're not some kind of
masked burglar

11:10.845 --> 11:12.125
Wait here.

11:14.205 --> 11:15.525
I'm going to get changed.

11:15.605 --> 11:17.525
Can you... can you just stop
saying things?

11:17.605 --> 11:18.645
What?

11:18.725 --> 11:20.645
He might've fallen in the garden!

11:20.725 --> 11:23.085
Yeah, but that is what the footage
is gonna show, right?

11:25.365 --> 11:27.165
On what day do you think it happened?

11:27.765 --> 11:29.165
Let me think...

11:30.485 --> 11:33.165
- Could we try May the 16th?
- Mm-hm.

11:33.285 --> 11:34.725
About 1:45 pm?

11:36.285 --> 11:38.005
Is that an Xbox One?

11:38.085 --> 11:39.565
Yes!

11:39.645 --> 11:42.725
If you're a serious gamer, you should
really consider getting the PS4.

11:42.805 --> 11:44.725
The Xbox One is a superior machine.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.525
For pure gaming, it's not,
and their network is a turd.

11:47.605 --> 11:49.525
Has PlayStation
got backwards compatibility?

11:49.605 --> 11:51.085
No, because we don't live in the past.

11:51.165 --> 11:52.685
You're just a PlayStation fanboy.

11:52.765 --> 11:55.485
And you're just a Microsoft pussy
with a Microsoft dick.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.365
- Right, get out!
- Let's not overreact...

11:57.445 --> 11:58.525
No, you too. Out.

11:58.605 --> 12:00.285
But we haven't looked at the footage yet.

12:00.365 --> 12:02.965
No, and you and Boardwalk Empire here
never will.

12:03.045 --> 12:04.885
- Apologize, Will.
- No fucking way!

12:04.965 --> 12:06.885
Get out! I'm calling the police on you.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.485
Out! Move! Thank you.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.850
Oh, the owners are here to greet us.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.730
I think they're the staff, Iain.

12:16.810 --> 12:18.410
Really? Okay.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.690
Darling, I do wish you'd worn
your matching trousers.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.770
I know, but moths had eaten
the gusset, darling.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.290
- Iain.
- Ah, Sherry.

12:30.810 --> 12:31.890
Hello.

12:32.730 --> 12:35.650
And your fragrant wife.

12:35.730 --> 12:37.370
Yes. This is Annette.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.370
- Hello... Sherry.
- Hello.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.890
Come and meet Mrs. S.
And the Frobishers are here and the-

12:43.970 --> 12:45.290
Excuse me, Mr. Samson.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.650
You've trodden in something.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.130
No, I don't think I have.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.290
Oh, bedknobs and broomsticks!

12:52.370 --> 12:54.290
- Make your excuses and go and clean them.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

12:54.770 --> 12:56.490
I'll go and find a hose.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.530
Oh, what?

12:59.770 --> 13:01.490
- 07700 800...
- It's me.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.330
Okay, you need to get here right now.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.970
I can't, Daniel. I'm at a function.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.650
There's footage of what happened
in the garden!

13:06.730 --> 13:09.570
My neighbor has a security camera
pointed right where it happened.

13:09.970 --> 13:11.050
Have you been arrested?

13:11.130 --> 13:13.210
No, but if he sees it then we both will.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.450
What am I supposed to do?

13:15.530 --> 13:17.810
Right. I need you to go round there

13:17.890 --> 13:19.930
and you need to steal the hard drive.

13:20.010 --> 13:22.250
How? Using my invisibility cloak?

13:22.330 --> 13:23.810
There must be something you can do.

13:23.890 --> 13:24.970
Ugh!

13:31.010 --> 13:33.210
It's always left to bloomin' muggins!

13:37.250 --> 13:38.490
I think Ash was having an affair.

13:39.170 --> 13:41.090
Ash? An affair? Don't be so silly.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.490
Oh, I think, um...

13:44.570 --> 13:45.810
Huh? Oh.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.210
Well, he certainly takes after his dad.

13:49.530 --> 13:52.690
Don't you, Mr. Stinky Winky?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.690
I miss you so much.

14:05.770 --> 14:08.050
I just want a little bit of you to keep.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.010
Fuck!

14:26.810 --> 14:27.810
Fuck.

14:50.610 --> 14:51.650
Hey.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.290
- You okay?
- Yes.

14:56.490 --> 14:57.490
Yeah.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.370
Got Ash.

15:06.010 --> 15:09.170
- Oh, hello.
- Who are you?

15:09.250 --> 15:13.690
I'm from the council,
sir. Just here spraying for pests.

15:13.770 --> 15:16.330
- What kind of pests?
- You never know, sir.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.610
There's a big increase in...

15:19.330 --> 15:20.930
in woodlice there.

15:23.050 --> 15:25.730
- Can I come in, sir? May I?
- Yes.

15:26.490 --> 15:27.810
Thanks a million.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.690
Stay close.

15:41.130 --> 15:42.770
Oh, right, yeah. Okay, good.

15:43.370 --> 15:46.570
Now... don't be scared, okay?

15:46.650 --> 15:48.130
- I'm not.
- Well, good.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.290
What if someone broke in?

15:49.370 --> 15:52.010
You said animal rights protestors
hate Mr. West.

15:52.090 --> 15:53.850
No one's broken in.

15:53.930 --> 15:56.210
Okay, hide.

16:03.410 --> 16:04.530
Get down!

16:09.850 --> 16:12.490
- Linda!
- Michael, what are you doing?

16:12.570 --> 16:14.570
We thought you were
an animal rights protestor.

16:14.650 --> 16:17.210
Oh, right.
And who are you?

16:17.290 --> 16:19.650
Well, my wife's away,
so I had to bring Beth with me.

16:20.410 --> 16:21.890
Well, nice to meet you.

16:22.410 --> 16:23.570
Are you his mistress?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.530
No! This is my daughter.

16:26.090 --> 16:27.370
- Oh, right.
- What are you doing here?

16:27.450 --> 16:29.770
Well, Mr. West asked me
to come and meet him here

16:29.850 --> 16:33.130
to show him my latest invention,
the office bracelet.

16:33.210 --> 16:35.290
Mr. West wouldn't call a meeting
on a Sunday.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.810
Oh, he was very insistent, and he told me
to wear my yellow dress.

16:40.610 --> 16:45.410
Okay, well, let's go and sort these lights
out before Mr. West gets here.

16:46.490 --> 16:48.930
Mr. West is trying to have sex with her,
isn't he?

16:49.370 --> 16:50.810
I don't know what that means.

16:57.530 --> 16:58.970
This is where we met

16:59.610 --> 17:01.290
and where he proposed to me.

17:02.530 --> 17:04.810
And now it's where he'll stay forever.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.210
Goodbye, Ash.

17:11.810 --> 17:13.410
Oh, God!

17:17.970 --> 17:19.890
Why... why is he like that?

17:21.210 --> 17:25.089
Well, the lid mustn't have
shut properly. I guess condensation?

17:25.890 --> 17:27.050
But he...

17:27.130 --> 17:30.130
Well, he can't just sit there on the lawn,
looking like a...

17:30.810 --> 17:32.010
- Turd.
- Will!

17:33.450 --> 17:36.370
I think it's gonna rain later.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.210
You know, that will, um, help to...

17:40.370 --> 17:41.450
evenly

17:42.810 --> 17:44.490
distribute... him.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.690
Oh, God!

17:47.530 --> 17:49.490
How do you evenly distribute a turd?

17:51.250 --> 17:52.730
You said you'd get that fixed.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.410
Oh, yeah. No, I called someone,

17:55.490 --> 17:58.930
but they said they couldn't
get it done for a couple of weeks.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.530
Well, somebody's tried to break in.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.410
No, it's squirrels. I told you.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.650
Becca, even if you wanna find out
if someone's broken in,

18:04.730 --> 18:05.970
he won't show you the footage.

18:06.450 --> 18:07.850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, what footage?

18:07.930 --> 18:10.690
- He's just...
- The camera up there

18:10.770 --> 18:11.810
would've filmed everything,

18:11.890 --> 18:13.330
- but there's no use going next door.
- Why?

18:13.410 --> 18:15.730
Because we already asked.
He said he wouldn't show us,

18:15.810 --> 18:17.890
stupid fucking Xbox fanboy.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.450
- Yeah, well, I'm going round right now.
- Wait!

18:21.530 --> 18:24.610
Do you know what, I think he said he was
going on holiday. He's not gonna be in.

18:27.450 --> 18:30.450
Sorry, sir. Could I have
a glass of water, sir?

18:32.010 --> 18:34.090
Oh, couldn't have it from the tap,
could I?

18:34.170 --> 18:35.810
I don't like the flavor of the bottles.

18:36.770 --> 18:38.050
Smells like dog shit in here.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.810
You're not welcome in here.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.850
Okay, you heard him.
Let's go, Becca.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.690
You have a camera
pointed at my property.

18:53.770 --> 18:55.370
Do you want me to have you arrested
as a peeping tom?

18:55.450 --> 18:57.570
I'm not a peeping tom!
I'm keeping the neighborhood safe.

18:57.650 --> 18:59.330
- Then show us the footage.
- Fine.

18:59.410 --> 19:02.450
But your mate Phantom of the Opera
was very insulting.

19:02.530 --> 19:04.570
- Yeah, sorry about him.
- Whoa!

19:07.810 --> 19:10.330
Council, spraying for bugs.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.890
- They not been to yours?
- No.

19:12.970 --> 19:15.290
I'll be round
to yours after here, madam.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.890
I know. Why don't you go back
and look after Vanessa

19:17.970 --> 19:20.130
and I'll stay here and take care of this.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.250
Can you just show us
the footage, please?

19:22.330 --> 19:26.050
I've already isolated the recording
from the day in question.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.170
Oh, yeah. That looks too grainy.

19:29.970 --> 19:32.610
I think this has been a waste of time.
I think we should... Let's go, Becca.

19:32.690 --> 19:35.930
It's 720p HD with a two-megapixel camera.

19:36.010 --> 19:37.650
It is <i>not</i> grainy.

19:42.370 --> 19:43.410
Whizz it on a bit.

19:48.330 --> 19:49.410
Right, yes.

19:49.490 --> 19:50.930
Oh, Seamus, ye...

19:51.650 --> 19:53.090
Ye ficking idiot, so!

19:54.130 --> 19:57.290
I have to pop out to me van.
I've forgotten something.

20:00.850 --> 20:02.410
I don't fucking believe it!

20:03.410 --> 20:04.770
You were right.

20:04.850 --> 20:05.890
Squirrels.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.930
See? Yeah, I told you.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.290
Bloody pests.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.290
- Thank Christ for that.
- What do you mean?

20:13.370 --> 20:14.930
Now we can't claim on the insurance.

20:15.690 --> 20:17.290
No, yeah, well, I meant, you know...

20:17.370 --> 20:21.650
Thank Christ we weren't targets
of dangerous thieves.

20:22.570 --> 20:24.490
So a squirrel blocked my lens

20:24.570 --> 20:26.890
whilst its mate vandalized your drainpipe?

20:27.530 --> 20:31.010
- Yeah. Yeah, that...
- that makes sense to me.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.210
You want me to

20:39.290 --> 20:41.170
spread it around a bit with my shoe?

20:45.050 --> 20:46.250
No.

20:50.610 --> 20:51.810
Bit more.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.570
Bit more. Thank you.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.250
Hello.

20:59.970 --> 21:01.010
Where have you been?

21:01.530 --> 21:04.330
You've missed all Sherry's stories
about playing billiards with Alex Higgins.

21:04.410 --> 21:08.290
Iain! Mrs. G told me
about your little accident.

21:08.370 --> 21:10.250
There's a lot of deer
in Barlow Lakes' grounds.

21:10.330 --> 21:13.370
Yes, my diagnosis is one of them has a...

21:14.290 --> 21:16.570
a bad case of deer-o-rrhea.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.650
Diarrhea.

21:20.170 --> 21:21.410
Very good, yes.

21:22.530 --> 21:25.330
I should look into getting you two
membership here.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.970
With Kenny West and me as sponsors,

21:27.050 --> 21:28.090
you'll be a...

21:28.170 --> 21:29.650
a shoe-in!

21:36.450 --> 21:38.370
- Finally.
- There you go.

21:38.450 --> 21:41.010
Nothing to be scared of. But, you know,
if you can't handle a dark office,

21:41.090 --> 21:44.290
then I don't think you can handle
<i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

21:49.250 --> 21:50.250
Kenny?

21:52.170 --> 21:53.490
Kenny?

22:05.010 --> 22:06.090
Kenny!

22:06.170 --> 22:07.330
Kenny, no!

22:11.570 --> 22:13.570
Mr. West committed suicide.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.570
Nope.

22:15.650 --> 22:17.810
That's autoerotic asphyxiation.
