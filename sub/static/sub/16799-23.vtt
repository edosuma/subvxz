00:01.500 --> 00:03.468
Previously on Elementary...

00:03.500 --> 00:04.467
SHINWELL:I'm looking for Joan.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.467
Mr. Johnson, I presume.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.330
Call me Shinwell.

00:06.370 --> 00:07.667
You're a formerdrug dealer, correct?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.337
Former drug user.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.338
Going from beinga doctor to this?

00:13.380 --> 00:15.177
It's must'vebeen hard, right?

00:15.210 --> 00:18.099
Yeah, actually, it was.I'm trying to change, too.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.378
This is the Bronx,SBK territory.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.116
South Bronx Killers?

00:22.150 --> 00:24.345
HOLMES: Shinwell's still engaged with SBK.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.381
Right, but he stillwants to bring SBK down.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.081
I offered that we train youto be an informant.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.519
We can teach youthe skills you require

00:29.560 --> 00:31.528
to survivethat undertaking.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.527
I'm telling you,Doc, I'm close.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.549
A couple more months,

00:33.600 --> 00:34.828
and this will all be over.

00:34.860 --> 00:38.364
SBK and their top brasswill go away forever.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.766
(knocks at door)WATSON:Shinwell?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.358
(lightbulb buzzes)

00:42.410 --> 00:43.559
Shinwell!

00:53.480 --> 00:55.778
GREGSON:Joan.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.412
Joan?

00:57.450 --> 00:59.452
You all right?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.253
We can go if you wish.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.326
No, we should talk toShinwell's neighbors.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.520
It's already done.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.425
No one heard or sawanything suspicious.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.291
You may have arrived justminutes after the killer left,

01:08.330 --> 01:10.389
but it might as wellhave been years.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.136
This scene is as coldas they come.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.138
GREGSON; You saidyour friend was working

01:14.170 --> 01:16.206
for the department as a C.I.,he was undercover in SBK?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.502
That's right.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.802
GREGSON:Gang informants

01:18.840 --> 01:20.637
have two jobs thatcan get them killed.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.500
I get whatthis looks like,

01:22.550 --> 01:24.347
him getting stabbed in the back.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.143
WATSON: That's whatthis gang does to snitches.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.841
You stab them in the back,they do the same to you.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.313
It's been that way for years.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.385
There's no sign of forced entry.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.150
Whoever did this may havebeen sent because Shinwell

01:33.190 --> 01:35.215
was willing tolet them in.We trained him.

01:35.260 --> 01:36.557
He would neverturn his back on someone

01:36.590 --> 01:37.682
he didn't trust completely.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.550
It was SBK, I'm sure of it.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.091
Do you have any ideawhy he invited you down here?

01:43.370 --> 01:46.430
He said he was making progress,moving up in the gang.

01:46.470 --> 01:47.562
Whatever he needed,

01:47.600 --> 01:49.329
he knew I'd try to help him.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.530
You were that close?

01:51.740 --> 01:54.436
It was complicated.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.402
I believed in what he was doing.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.543
EMS:Captain.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.712
GREGSON: I don't know ifit's any consolation,

02:05.750 --> 02:08.514
but we're gonnafind the guy who did this.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.359
I've always found it

02:22.410 --> 02:24.765
one of your mostcommendable qualities,

02:24.810 --> 02:26.437
that you're moreforgiving of other people

02:26.480 --> 02:29.802
than you areof yourself.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.477
But this was not your fault.

02:31.510 --> 02:32.579
None of it was.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.838
Shinwell wason this path

02:34.880 --> 02:36.643
long before we came across him.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.839
He knew better than anyoneit could end this way.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.788
I don't feel responsible.

02:46.430 --> 02:47.658
I'm angry.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.764
And I'm not surethat I'm ready to say

02:51.800 --> 02:53.563
that his path was a dead end.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.397
What do you mean?

02:55.440 --> 02:58.500
Say we find the personwho killed him, so what?

02:58.540 --> 03:00.235
That person was justfollowing orders,

03:00.280 --> 03:02.544
protecting his boss, making surethat nothing changes,

03:02.580 --> 03:05.549
so the drugs keep flowingand the bodies keep piling up.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.946
Shinwell was tryingto do something important.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.585
We have to decide

03:10.620 --> 03:12.611
whether that died tonight, too.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.878
You sure you want to do this?

03:17.430 --> 03:19.625
Well, get some sleep then,Watson.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.321
Tomorrow morningwe go to war with

03:21.360 --> 03:23.521
one of New York'sdeadliest gangs.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.897
*

03:59.300 --> 04:00.699
(elevator dings)

04:00.740 --> 04:02.037
Detective Guzman.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.901
Thanks for comingdown here so quickly.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.579
Of course, no worries.

04:06.610 --> 04:09.647
Entire gang unit feels likethey were punched in the gut.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.898
Shinwell was a good C.I., but...

04:11.950 --> 04:13.611
he was your friend.

04:13.650 --> 04:14.776
Sorry for the loss.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.481
Thank you.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.885
I broughtwhat you asked for.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.478
Happy to give youthe rundown on SBK,

04:19.520 --> 04:20.748
but I got to warn you,

04:20.790 --> 04:22.655
the pool of suspectson this is huge.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.726
There's about 200 people on thestreet that could've done this.

04:24.760 --> 04:25.886
That's all right,Sherlock and I

04:25.930 --> 04:27.056
aren't really lookingat the case

04:27.100 --> 04:28.727
that way.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.728
What do you mean?We're hoping you can

04:30.770 --> 04:33.398
bring us up to speed on theperson who's really responsible.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.896
We want the head of SBK.

04:34.940 --> 04:39.309
Well, hell,I like the sound of that.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.729
Bonzi Folsom, that's our guy.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.578
Head of SBK since 2004.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.316
13 years.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.818
Where I grew up, no one was kingof the hill for more than three.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.887
Yeah, Bonzi's probably sneakingup on some sort of record.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.979
Helps when you get startedas young as he did.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.621
Raised by a single mom,

04:58.660 --> 05:00.093
grew up with a fewhalf brothers and sisters

05:00.130 --> 05:01.654
in Section 8 housing.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.565
First arrest at 14.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.022
GUZMANzFirst and last.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.891
He was suspected of a few gangmurders in his teens,

05:07.940 --> 05:09.032
but never enough to charge.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.538
Made it to the throne at 21

05:12.580 --> 05:13.774
and we haven't laida glove on him since.

05:13.810 --> 05:15.368
He must be careful.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.843
That would bethe understatement of the year.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.074
He's downright paranoid.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.543
Ruthless, too.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.877
Pretty deadly combo.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.046
So, if this is whowe're going after,

05:22.080 --> 05:23.547
what's the best angle?

05:24.590 --> 05:25.887
Your guess is as good as mine.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.717
We've thrownthe kitchen sink

05:27.760 --> 05:29.079
at Bonzi Folsom; nothing sticks.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.758
Over the years,we've brought cases

05:30.790 --> 05:32.394
against dozensof his people;

05:32.430 --> 05:34.694
nobody ever flips.Never?

05:34.730 --> 05:36.095
Usually, they're too afraid

05:36.130 --> 05:38.098
of what would happen totheir families if they talked.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.092
What aboutelectronic surveillance?

05:41.140 --> 05:43.529
We're up on all their phones;it's a waste of time.

05:43.570 --> 05:46.061
Nobody in the gang ever talksbusiness on the open line.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.998
So how do they communicate?Everything is face-to-face?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.473
We don't know.

05:49.510 --> 05:50.875
Bonzi mostlystays holed up

05:50.910 --> 05:52.104
in his apartment.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.573
He lives on the top floor

05:54.620 --> 05:56.417
of the Greenwood Projects.

05:56.450 --> 05:59.715
Probably because it's rightin the middle of his territory.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.648
Crazy thing is,

06:01.690 --> 06:03.089
he almost nevergets any visitors.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.690
And we have eyes onhis place at all times,

06:05.730 --> 06:07.618
and we never see anybodycome or go.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.059
You make himsound like a hermit.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.067
It's weirder than that.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.399
He keeps a couple of girlsin his place 24/7,

06:13.440 --> 06:15.499
couple of guards, too,but they go where he goes.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.508
We got eyes on his social media.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.837
But it's about as exciting

06:18.870 --> 06:20.178
as your averagesoccer mom's.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.677
Take a look.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.944
BELL: "Ten old sitcom starsthat are getting fat.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.538
Number six will amaze you."

06:28.520 --> 06:29.919
So, I got to ask,

06:29.950 --> 06:31.588
given how littleyou've got on the guy,

06:31.620 --> 06:33.485
how can you be so surehe's the one

06:33.520 --> 06:34.885
running the gang?Trust me.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.480
Nobody who livesin SBK territory has any doubt.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.498
And we didn't buildthis org chart

06:39.530 --> 06:40.997
based on whispers in the street.

06:41.030 --> 06:43.521
Shinwell wasn'tthe first C.I. we've lost,

06:43.570 --> 06:45.026
he was our third.

06:45.070 --> 06:46.662
All of them said Bonziwas the shot-caller,

06:46.700 --> 06:48.668
all of them gottaken out on his orders.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.065
We just can't prove it.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.034
Perhaps Mr. Folsom's familyare aware of his methods.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.071
Have you tried talking tohis half brother, Tyus Wilcox?

06:55.110 --> 06:57.078
We had high hopes for Tyus.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.510
A bright guy, sort of theblack sheep of the family

06:59.550 --> 07:01.040
because he didn'tgo into the drug trade.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.446
Won't takeBonzi's money.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.050
He's a small businessconsultant, lives in Midtown.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.614
And?

07:07.660 --> 07:08.957
And we approached hima couple years back,

07:08.990 --> 07:10.628
after Bonzi put himin the hospital

07:10.660 --> 07:12.218
with a broken jaw.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.023
He's been estranged fromthe family ever since,

07:14.060 --> 07:15.596
but he still won't talk to us.

07:15.630 --> 07:16.767
HOLMES: Well, perhapshe just hasn't been

07:16.800 --> 07:19.530
properly motivated yet.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.868
I think I might havea remedy for that.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.799
Yes. Thank you very much,Agent Burke,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.774
we appreciate it.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.472
Right, so it's as I suspected.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.171
Bonzi Folsom's mother, Odette,

07:32.210 --> 07:34.019
can be prosecutedunder federal law.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.472
For cheating on her taxes?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.181
Well, cheating implies intent.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.040
I think someone just madea tabulation error.

07:39.090 --> 07:41.513
But the salient fact isthat she owed $10,000 more

07:41.560 --> 07:43.152
than she paid in 2012.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.489
Looks like Ms. Folsom'sdoing all right for herself.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.498
GUZMAN: SBK membersmostly get paid cash,

07:48.530 --> 07:50.669
but Bonzi's family lives large.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.019
They have to beable to show income

07:52.070 --> 07:53.162
to keep the feds off their back.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.862
So they get paidfor no-show jobs

07:55.900 --> 07:58.505
and a couple of, uh,car washes and an arcade.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.007
Bonzi owns them throughshell corporations.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.530
It's an elegant scheme,

08:01.580 --> 08:04.208
but one thatrequires better maths

08:04.250 --> 08:06.969
than are displayedon Odette's 1099

08:07.020 --> 08:08.908
Our friend at the Bureau saysthat it's a fringe case,

08:08.950 --> 08:10.645
but he will support usif we want to use it

08:10.690 --> 08:12.282
to lean on Tyus.WATSON:If he loves his mother,

08:12.320 --> 08:15.619
he won't want to see herprosecuted for tax fraud.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.127
I just can't believewe missed this.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.594
Could I talk to youfor a second?

08:23.300 --> 08:24.767
What's up?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.631
Not to put too finea point on it,

08:26.670 --> 08:28.831
but I don't think you and Marcusshould feel obligated

08:28.870 --> 08:30.758
to take Guzman with you whenyou go to speak to Mr. Wilcox.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.232
The gang unit didn'tget anywhere in 13 years,

08:32.270 --> 08:34.079
I think it's past timefor new blood.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.032
Mm. What about you?You're not coming?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.571
I know it's bad timing,but I have to go to a meeting.

08:38.610 --> 08:40.077
Is everything okay?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.212
Yeah. It will be.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.010
HOLMES: My name is Sherlock and I'm an addict.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.755
GROUP: Hi, Sherlock.

08:48.790 --> 08:52.123
Some time ago,my business partner and I,

08:52.160 --> 08:54.151
we started workingwith a man who

08:54.200 --> 08:59.661
needed to change,but just couldn't.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.134
Any-Aanay. . .

09:02.170 --> 09:04.900
yesterday,it all ended in failure.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.942
Tragedy, actually.

09:15.220 --> 09:18.041
The-The man of whom I speak,he was, he was not an addict,

09:18.090 --> 09:22.083
but he was attemptinga recovery of sorts.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.759
(sighs deeply)

09:26.800 --> 09:29.291
In many respects,he just didn't try hard enough.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.261
It just,it-it reminded me that, uh,

09:36.300 --> 09:38.302
that I need to try harder.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.642
GROUP LEADER:Would anyone else like to share?

09:45.680 --> 09:50.049
TAYLOR: Hi. My name is Taylor,and I'm an addict.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.240
GROUP:Hi, Taylor.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.212
WOMAN :Sherlock?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.285
I'm sorry about your friend.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.925
Thank you,but he wasn't my friend.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.349
Well, the thing is, I've knownyou a good deal longer

10:01.400 --> 10:02.822
than that lot.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.767
You've got more on your mind.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.268
Yeah, I suppose I do.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.201
I'm always here to listen.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.276
It is sort of my job.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.171
HOLMES: Several weeks ago,in Bronxville,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.313
911 received a call

10:22.350 --> 10:25.410
from a high school senior

10:25.450 --> 10:27.156
named Luke Munro.

10:27.190 --> 10:30.682
He said an intruderhad broken into his family home

10:30.730 --> 10:32.948
and strangled his girlfriend,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.252
a girl named Mira Tunney.

10:35.300 --> 10:39.327
When the police arrived,Mira was dead.

10:39.370 --> 10:42.237
Ligature marks indicatedthat she had been choked

10:42.270 --> 10:43.828
with a metal chain.

10:43.870 --> 10:49.331
Luke had similar markson the palms of his hands.

10:49.380 --> 10:53.976
Now, he claimed that the woundswere the result of a struggle

10:54.020 --> 10:57.217
with Mira's killer,who fled the scene.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.309
The police thought they weremuch more likely caused

10:59.350 --> 11:02.057
when Luke killed Mira himself.

11:02.090 --> 11:07.153
There were rumorsthat she'd been unfaithful.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.988
Problem was, the murder weaponcould not be found.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.190
And there were no indications

11:12.230 --> 11:14.790
that Luke had everleft the scene.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.398
Now, the detectivecharged with the case,

11:16.440 --> 11:18.408
was an acquaintance of minecalled Perkins.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.273
He, he invited meto attend Luke's interrogation.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.847
When it concluded,I told Perkins

11:23.880 --> 11:28.249
that everything I'd heardwas a lie.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.215
I mean, the young man's hapticswere in direct contrast

11:31.250 --> 11:33.150
to the story he was peddling.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.158
I predicted it was a matterof time before the weapon

11:35.190 --> 11:36.851
that he used was found,

11:36.890 --> 11:40.098
and, uh... I encouraged Perkinsto arrest him on the spot,

11:40.130 --> 11:41.859
which he did.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.460
Well, that soundslike a very positive outcome.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.866
So what's the problem?

11:46.900 --> 11:48.492
Well, a couple of days ago,

11:48.540 --> 11:51.839
Luke Munro fashioneda noose out of some sheets

11:51.870 --> 11:54.338
and hung himselfin his jail cell.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.269
And he left a notein which he swore

11:57.310 --> 11:59.198
he did not hurt Mira Tunney.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.345
Well, he won't bethe first killer

12:02.380 --> 12:04.780
to go to his graveprotesting his innocence.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.310
And if the greatSherlock Holmes

12:06.350 --> 12:08.750
thought he was lying, well,

12:08.790 --> 12:12.180
that's typically rathera strong indicator of guilt, no?

12:12.230 --> 12:15.757
I never visited the crime scene.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.395
I never spoke to the friendsand family of the victim,

12:19.430 --> 12:21.193
or the alleged killer.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.798
You were never asked to.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.501
And the chainstill hasn't been found.

12:24.540 --> 12:28.203
What if that's because LukeMunro was telling the truth,

12:28.240 --> 12:31.846
and the real culprittook it with him when he fled?

12:34.150 --> 12:38.883
You can sit down if you want,but this isn't gonna take long.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.387
I don't have anything to say.

12:40.420 --> 12:43.059
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,Mr. Wilcox.

12:43.090 --> 12:44.284
When we spoke on the phone,

12:44.330 --> 12:46.423
it sounded like you were willingto cooperate.

12:46.460 --> 12:50.066
Well, I didn't want my momto suffer for Bonzi's mistakes.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.068
Now, I'll talk to you,and pay her back taxes

12:52.100 --> 12:53.829
if that's what it takes,

12:53.870 --> 12:55.292
but I don't have anythingthat's gonna help you.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.399
Your mothertakes money from Bonzi.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.305
Blood money that he makesfrom selling drugs.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.228
She does the best she can.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.269
BELL: Did she clothe best she could

13:02.310 --> 13:03.800
raising Bonzi?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.374
Matter of fact, yeah, she did.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.809
Look at me.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.442
He and I grew upin the same house.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.347
Right. You got good grades,you went to good schools,

13:11.390 --> 13:12.789
you startedyour own business doing...

13:14.960 --> 13:16.154
I'm sorry.What is it you do here?

13:16.190 --> 13:18.351
Complex systems analysis.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.051
Right. That's not exactlyslinging drugs

13:20.100 --> 13:21.249
and killing people.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.098
I mean, is thatwhy he broke your jaw?

13:24.130 --> 13:25.529
He wanted to take youdown a peg?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.292
I told himI was worried about him.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.205
He'd always usedhis own product,

13:31.240 --> 13:35.108
but I thoughtit was getting worse.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.108
I guess he didn't appreciatethe concern.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.874
He resents you. Your education,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.171
the life you've built.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.471
My brother isn't jealous.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.385
He thinks I'm weak.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.217
He's a lot smarterthan I am.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.081
There's nothing averageabout him.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.929
BELL:We don't disagree.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.428
Bonzi's been staying a stepahead for a long, long time.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.257
Our gang unitcan't even figure out

13:54.300 --> 13:57.224
how he directs his organization,how they communicate.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.137
And you think I knowhow he talks to his people?

14:00.170 --> 14:02.263
He doesn't even talk to me.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.131
Come on, Mr. Wilcox.You grew up with this guy.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.035
We haven't been in thesame room for two years.

14:06.070 --> 14:07.628
I have no cluehow he runs things.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.501
I'm not allowed anywherenear him or his place.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.872
Really? Because that photo lookslike it was taken at New Year's.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.217
Those are Bonzi'sdaughters,

14:15.250 --> 14:16.569
right?Yeah.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.611
But I didn't take that picture.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.356
He put that up online.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.424
That's the only wayI get to see them anymore.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.348
I'm telling you.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.393
I don't know that manany better than you do.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.395
Hey, how was the meeting?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.499
Uneventful.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.906
How did it gowith Bonzi's little brother?

14:39.940 --> 14:41.339
He's on the outsidelooking in,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.371
just like the NYPD.The only difference is,

14:43.410 --> 14:45.298
the way he keeps tabson his brother

14:45.350 --> 14:47.215
is a little more useful thanthe department's surveillance.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.218
What are you talking about?

14:49.250 --> 14:50.615
He stays currenton Bonzi's social media,

14:50.650 --> 14:52.379
something we should start doing.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.058
I think it's howBonzi runs his gang.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.251
You know why he posted this?

14:56.290 --> 14:58.053
Either to celebrate or protest

14:58.090 --> 15:00.024
the current president. Withoutknowing Mr. Folsom's feelings

15:00.060 --> 15:01.550
on bearded dragons,it would be difficult to say.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.966
The picture is beside the point.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.218
His whole feedis random junk like this.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.965
Family photos, recipes,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.558
political memes,birthday wishes.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.704
It looks as innocentas Guzman said it was.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.628
But there's more to itthan meets the eye?

15:13.680 --> 15:17.104
Check out the filename.

15:19.510 --> 15:20.272
Now, lots of socialmedia platforms

15:20.320 --> 15:22.311
use randomizedstrings of letters

15:22.350 --> 15:23.942
to link to imagesfrom other sites,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.446
but that's not what this is.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.412
He uploaded that imagefrom his own computer.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.587
And he named it himself.I think it's a code,

15:29.620 --> 15:31.383
instructionsonly his guys can read.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.727
You haven't cracked it yet?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.455
Not yet.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.092
I've run a bunch of thesethrough Mason's

15:36.130 --> 15:37.620
decryption software, but so far,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.490
I've come up empty.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.669
(phone chimes)

15:41.700 --> 15:45.329
According to Marcus, BonziFolsom just called the police.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.338
He says he hasinformation

15:47.380 --> 15:50.247
regarding Shinwell's murder.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.639
What do you wantto bet the elevator's

15:56.680 --> 15:58.318
not really out of order,

15:58.350 --> 15:59.647
and this guy'sjust screwing with us?

15:59.690 --> 16:02.659
You might've raisedthat possibility in the lobby.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.391
Cops here.

16:12.330 --> 16:16.437
What's up, detectives?

16:16.470 --> 16:18.529
You must be the oneI talked to on the phone.

16:18.570 --> 16:19.730
I'm Marcus Bell.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.102
This is SherlockHolmes, Joan Watson.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.574
Thank you for havingus in your home.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.747
I see it wasn't

16:25.780 --> 16:27.145
just paid for by cocaine,

16:27.180 --> 16:29.375
but your decoratorwas also a fan.

16:29.420 --> 16:31.547
Hard work paidfor this home, man.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.581
I'm not a drug dealer,I'm a community leader.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.417
HOLMES:What a coincidence,

16:35.460 --> 16:37.451
that the community you leadis teeming with drugs.

16:37.490 --> 16:39.378
BELL:Look, you called us,

16:39.430 --> 16:41.694
Mr. Folsom. What's this about?

16:41.730 --> 16:45.427
Look, people in this community,they, they trust me.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.563
And I, I hear things.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.161
I can't tell you where I heardthis one thing in particular,

16:51.210 --> 16:52.700
but I think I know somethingabout that guy

16:52.740 --> 16:54.469
they pulled out of that buildingon 124th street.

16:54.510 --> 16:56.774
Shinwell Johnson.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.599
You can say his name.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.642
Yeah, um, Shinwell.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.478
You're gonna want to talkto this dude,

17:05.520 --> 17:07.659
lives around the way.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.612
Goes by Tall Boy.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.218
You're talking aboutLaquan Eversley.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.148
He's one of your people.

17:15.530 --> 17:18.226
I got nothingto do with SBK.

17:18.270 --> 17:22.195
What I heard is Tall Boystabbed your man,

17:22.240 --> 17:23.468
and chucked the knifein a dumpster

17:23.510 --> 17:25.569
behind the Ydown the block.

17:25.610 --> 17:29.398
If I was you, I'd go look.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.712
That's all I know.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.672
We know what you're doing.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.418
Oh, yeah? What's that?

17:40.460 --> 17:43.327
You're selling out one of yourpeople to tie this thing off.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.527
You think that Tall Boy's

17:45.560 --> 17:46.686
gonna take the fall,

17:46.730 --> 17:49.198
and we'll take the win, andwe'll stop looking deeper.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.698
But you're wrong, becauseShinwell is dead because of you.

17:51.730 --> 17:54.563
And we're not gonna stopuntil you're behind bars.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.603
That's all right,that's all right, fellas.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.460
Just 'cause shewants to get hostile

17:59.510 --> 18:01.808
doesn't mean that we have to.

18:04.410 --> 18:07.140
I think it's timefor y'all to go.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.582
(door opens)

18:16.620 --> 18:19.487
Do you remember me?I'm Joan Watson.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.658
I work with the detectiveswho brought you in here.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.624
I was friends with Shinwell.

18:25.670 --> 18:28.639
You're herebecause earlier tonight,

18:28.670 --> 18:30.467
a switchblade was foundthat was consistent

18:30.510 --> 18:32.364
with the typethat was used to kill him.

18:32.410 --> 18:34.298
It had yourfingerprints

18:34.340 --> 18:35.637
and traces of his blood on it.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.669
We know that you killed him.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.710
I'm talking to youbecause I think

18:40.750 --> 18:42.342
that's what he would've wanted.

18:42.380 --> 18:45.178
A long time ago,SBK had him

18:45.220 --> 18:46.380
kill a friend, too.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.717
He never got over it.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.682
The pain that you're feelingright now?

18:49.720 --> 18:52.382
I don't thinkhe would've wanted that for you.

18:55.230 --> 18:58.620
In fact, if he were still here,I think he would forgive you.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.806
You are notas important to the police

19:03.840 --> 19:06.661
as the personwho ordered the murder.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.701
So give them a name, and I thinlqou can spare yourself

19:08.740 --> 19:09.809
some time in prison.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.443
You think I'm a snitch?

19:13.480 --> 19:14.572
I think you're ina lot of trouble.

19:14.620 --> 19:15.644
(laughs)

19:15.680 --> 19:16.772
You think I killed someone

19:16.820 --> 19:17.889
for talking to the police,

19:17.920 --> 19:19.683
and now I'm gonna talk, too?

19:19.720 --> 19:22.359
No, of course not.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.324
Because SBK has a code.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.282
You and your friends,you don't talk.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.719
But who do you think told themabout the switchblade?

19:28.760 --> 19:30.318
Who do you thinktold them where it was?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.292
You gonna try to tell meit was one of my boys.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.490
No, it wasn't one of your boys.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.939
It was Bonzi Folsom.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.670
SBK, they're not your friends,Laquan.

19:40.710 --> 19:41.608
They used youfor what they needed,

19:41.640 --> 19:43.744
and then they threw you away.Shinwell,

19:43.780 --> 19:45.338
he was your friend.No.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.610
Shin wasn't my friend,he was a rat.

19:47.650 --> 19:50.517
You acting like thepolice want to help me.

19:50.550 --> 19:52.279
Only, where were theywhen my mom's boyfriend

19:52.320 --> 19:54.311
chased me out of the housewhen I was 13, huh?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.453
Where were they when Ididn't have a place to live,

19:56.490 --> 19:57.582
or food to eat?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.292
SBK took me in.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.729
They took care of me.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.625
And they trusted meto take care of them.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.490
Just like they trusted Shinwell.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.998
They my family.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.928
And I'm not sayinganything against them.

20:09.970 --> 20:11.733
Not ever.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.868
Hey.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.400
Chin up.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.644
You made a good run in there.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.819
Maybe his lavwercan talk some sense into him.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.249
Get him to take a deal?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.713
I wouldn't count on it.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.389
Our gang unit's had plentyof shots at this crew.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.253
SBK guys don't flip.

20:29.290 --> 20:31.554
WATSON: I thoughthe might be different.

20:32.860 --> 20:36.523
You found one?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.824
GREGSON:What is that?

20:38.870 --> 20:42.328
This is an Enigma machine.

20:42.370 --> 20:43.667
During the Second World War,this device

20:43.710 --> 20:45.701
representeda transformative leap forward

20:45.740 --> 20:47.605
in cryptography.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.608
It is a product of pure genius.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.641
What's it doing here?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.875
We're keeping upwith the Joneses.

20:52.910 --> 20:55.344
Or rather, keeping upwith the Folsoms, Bonzi Folsom.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.644
He had the very samemodel in his apartment.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.578
HOLMES: I noticed it tucked under his desk.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.757
Didn't quite fit with the rest of his aesthetic.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.610
Every day, Mr. Folsom uses

21:02.660 --> 21:03.752
his Enigma machineto encrypt messages

21:03.790 --> 21:06.827
he wants to sendto his SBK brethren.

21:06.860 --> 21:08.054
He then takesthe ensuing codes

21:08.100 --> 21:09.988
and disguises themas ﬁlenames

21:10.030 --> 21:11.497
on his social media feed.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.758
His cronies, then,using their own

21:12.800 --> 21:14.836
Enigma machines,decrypt the messages,

21:14.870 --> 21:15.962
carry out the orders.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.639
There are digital Enigmasimulators online,

21:18.670 --> 21:19.898
but Bonzi uses a real one.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.669
So we thought we'dbetter get one, too,

21:21.710 --> 21:23.974
in case he modifies histo affect the encryption.

21:24.010 --> 21:26.979
How long beforewe're reading his mail?

21:27.010 --> 21:29.444
Might take a while.We've narrowed it down

21:29.480 --> 21:31.983
to 100 billionsubstitution codes.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.510
The machine hasfour rotors.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.858
Each rotor hasZ6 contact pins

21:35.890 --> 21:37.084
representing the lettersof the alphabet.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.485
WATSON: What we needto do is figure out

21:38.530 --> 21:41.328
how SBK synchronizestheir settings

21:41.360 --> 21:45.091
to their machines,and then we'll have them.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.597
Excuse me a moment,would you?

21:54.740 --> 21:56.537
We've been over this.I know.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.808
I'm not supposedto come here.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.375
I just wanted to seehow you were doing.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.743
You seemed so troubledyesterday.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.439
Well, actually,I'm doing better.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.117
I believe I've determinedwhy the police in Bronxville

22:08.160 --> 22:09.809
were unable tolocate the chain

22:09.860 --> 22:11.657
which was used tokill Mira Tunney.Oh?

22:11.690 --> 22:14.056
Well, they made the mistakeof questioning some

22:14.100 --> 22:16.455
of Luke Munro's story,but not all of it.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.060
He claimed that she waskilled inside his home.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.795
I think the deedwas done elsewhere.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.864
I think he moved the body

22:21.900 --> 22:23.834
before he called 911.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.662
The Munro's neighbor is

22:26.710 --> 22:28.678
a divorced father of two,often away on business.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.109
So over the last few months,Luke and his friends

22:30.140 --> 22:32.472
have taken to partyingin his backyard.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.546
I found theseon social media.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.948
Is that him?Mm-hmm.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.912
Luke Munro.

22:42.190 --> 22:45.079
Note the chains on the swinghe's sitting on.

22:45.130 --> 22:48.156
You think he used oneof those to strangle Mira?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.862
The spacing on the linksappears to be a match

22:50.900 --> 22:52.424
for the ligatureson her neck.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.938
So he killed herin the neighbor's yard,

22:54.970 --> 22:56.767
and carried her backto his house.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.507
I'm planning to visit the sceneat my earliest convenience.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.768
I'm hoping there'llbe some blood

23:00.810 --> 23:02.471
from either his handsor Mira's neck

23:02.510 --> 23:03.909
on the offending chain.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.442
Well, I'm happy for you.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.811
You can resta bit easier now.

23:08.850 --> 23:11.011
Can I?

23:11.050 --> 23:13.951
I don't understand.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.878
I'll be very clear.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.928
Don't come here again.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.105
(birds singing)

23:34.210 --> 23:35.939
WATSON:Good morning.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.900
You haven't changedsince yesterday.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.076
I haven't slept.

23:40.110 --> 23:42.044
Now I couldn't sleep,even if I tried.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.913
After you went to bed,I kept working

23:44.950 --> 23:46.178
on the big question.

23:46.220 --> 23:47.949
So how do Bonzi'stoadies know

23:47.990 --> 23:49.912
which Enigma settings to use

23:49.960 --> 23:52.178
to translate his messages?Yes.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.654
So take a look at the blindsin these surveillance photos

23:55.700 --> 23:57.827
of Bonzi's place.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.133
Hmm.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.968
So he's taken to bendingdifferent slats on his windows.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.966
The blinds have morethan 40 slats,

24:06.010 --> 24:08.035
but he never goesbelow the 26th one.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.641
26 letters in the alphabet.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.478
Four different gearson this model of Enigma.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.919
Four blindsflipped every day.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.986
Anyone looking up at hiswindow could see them.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.818
I've been decoding hisold messages since midnight.

24:20.860 --> 24:21.918
Look.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.986
Oh, that's unfortunate.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.850
He's careful, right?

24:27.900 --> 24:30.152
Hmm, not only does the mancommunicate in code,

24:30.200 --> 24:32.020
everything he saysis euphemistic.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.697
He never comes right outand says what he means,

24:33.740 --> 24:37.039
but I think Iunderstand his slang.

24:37.070 --> 24:39.129
So, this picture'sfilename reads,

24:39.170 --> 24:42.537
"If T needs fresh,get him an orange."

24:42.580 --> 24:44.775
"T" is obviouslyan SBK dealer,

24:44.810 --> 24:47.005
and according to the fileswe got from the gang unit,

24:47.050 --> 24:49.041
SBK likes to usedifferent color paper

24:49.080 --> 24:51.048
to wrap differentquantities of drugs.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.183
So orange isa kilo of coke.

24:53.220 --> 24:55.586
Mr. Folsom couldplausibly deny

24:55.620 --> 24:57.212
the meaning of anyof these messages.

24:57.260 --> 24:58.784
The captainagrees with you.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.718
I woke him up withthis two hours ago.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.091
He said the DA. needsproof that we're

25:02.130 --> 25:04.223
interpreting thegang's lingo correctly.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.762
You know what would goa long way to that end?

25:07.800 --> 25:09.665
A successful stingbased on intercepted

25:09.700 --> 25:11.861
and properly decodedSBK messages?

25:11.910 --> 25:13.605
There's one in the offing?

25:13.640 --> 25:15.073
Actually, one should havealready gone down.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.943
Marcus took a tactical unitto a spot where a deal

25:17.980 --> 25:20.073
was supposedto take place.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.078
We'll be able toshow the DA. that

25:22.120 --> 25:23.712
we knew where to go

25:23.750 --> 25:25.149
thanks to this little gem.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.978
"Pick up 10 oranges at grandma'sfor breakfast. 8:30."

25:29.020 --> 25:30.157
"Grandma" isthe street name

25:30.190 --> 25:31.987
of a suspectedSBK associate.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.022
He runs a bodega nearthe Port of New York.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.994
Well, you seem to haveeverything well in hand.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.099
I should sleep inmore often.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.860
(phone ringing)

25:44.370 --> 25:46.736
(ringing)

25:48.740 --> 25:50.071
Hello?

25:50.110 --> 25:51.008
GREGSON:We go a problem.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.642
Our bust just went bust.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.170
What are you talking about?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.211
At 8:30 we saw two known SBKmembers enter the bodega.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.013
When they moved out,we moved in.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.280
Only they didn't haveany drugs on them.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.254
That can't be.Bonzi's message said,

26:02.290 --> 26:04.087
"Pick up 10 oranges."

26:04.130 --> 26:05.654
Yeah, it did. And you wantto know what we found

26:05.690 --> 26:06.987
on these guys?

26:07.030 --> 26:09.624
Actual oranges.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.218
I don't know how,but Bonzi Folsom

26:11.270 --> 26:12.294
realized we were onto him.

26:12.330 --> 26:13.831
Try and bring any of this

26:13.870 --> 26:15.337
to the DA. now, and he'll say,

26:15.370 --> 26:17.258
"This just proves that when SBK

26:17.300 --> 26:19.006
"talks about oranges,

26:19.040 --> 26:20.337
they're talking about produce."

26:20.370 --> 26:22.270
Captain, look at this.

26:26.050 --> 26:28.245
Joan, take a lookat Bonzi's feed.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.210
He killed it.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.613
More than that.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.355
He killed anychance we had

26:37.390 --> 26:38.687
of using it against him.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.929
All the A.D.A.s were passingthis one around last week.

26:46.970 --> 26:49.097
People think the baby looks likeJudge Natrino.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.368
Yeah, well, we'repretty sure

26:50.400 --> 26:52.334
Bonzi Folsom posted that

26:52.370 --> 26:54.930
to order the beatingof a shopkeeper.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.333
The guy tried toshoo SBK dealers

26:56.380 --> 26:59.770
away from his business,now he's in a coma.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.346
Y
ou're "pr
etty
sure."

27:04.790 --> 27:07.145
So what I'm looking at,they represent

27:07.190 --> 27:10.079
all of Mr. Folsom'scommunication with SBK

27:10.120 --> 27:12.224
during the past five years?

27:12.260 --> 27:14.899
Yeah, it was all archivedbefore he deleted his account.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.898
You mean beforeyour failed operation.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.693
What went wrong there, guys?

27:18.730 --> 27:20.391
BELL:Look, a few days ago I went

27:20.430 --> 27:22.159
to Mr. Folsom's homewith two of our consultants.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.189
One of them noticedan encryption device

27:23.240 --> 27:24.832
in his apartment.

27:24.870 --> 27:27.338
Now, it could be Mr. Folsomnoticed him noticing,

27:27.370 --> 27:29.235
realized that we could

27:29.280 --> 27:30.679
get up on theircommunications.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.041
The operation this morning,we went looking

27:32.080 --> 27:33.377
for a smoking gun,we didn't get it.

27:33.410 --> 27:36.277
But, Nelson, there's stillplenty of smoke there.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.787
Those messages in your hand,

27:37.820 --> 27:40.084
they direct SBK membersto buy and sell drugs,

27:40.120 --> 27:41.712
to kill people.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.011
Even without the confirmation

27:43.060 --> 27:45.085
that we know every bitof their slang,

27:45.130 --> 27:46.427
the pattern ought to suggest

27:46.460 --> 27:48.451
that there'sa pretty strong case

27:48.500 --> 27:51.219
against Folsom.I've got to disagreewith you, Captain.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.919
I can't gopoint the finger

27:52.970 --> 27:54.267
without proof ofwhat all this means.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.734
I'm sorry.

27:56.770 --> 27:58.738
These guys have beendropping bodies

27:58.770 --> 28:00.931
all over the Bronxfor almost two decades.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.800
Then keep combing throughthese old messages.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.102
You got a ton, right?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.105
There's got to be some kind of

28:05.150 --> 28:06.845
handhold for you in here.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.144
Find me somethingand come back.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.183
Preferably when I'mnot late for court.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.329
(ringing)

28:19.890 --> 28:21.118
How'd it go?

28:21.160 --> 28:23.196
GREGSON:Uh, about as well as we thought.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.027
The D.A.'s notgonna go for it.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.368
We need another angleon Bonzi Folsom.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.038
HOLMES (over phone):Actually, we're not sure we do.

28:29.070 --> 28:32.005
We think we've found a new wayto attack SBK.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.205
So Sherlock and Iwent through

28:35.240 --> 28:37.379
all of SBK'sold messages.

28:37.410 --> 28:39.298
A few of them actuallymention names--

28:39.350 --> 28:41.011
civilians who don't appear

28:41.050 --> 28:42.870
to have anythingto do with the gang.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.309
"Matthew Katzman,

28:45.350 --> 28:46.840
"Neal Watters, Carol Logan,

28:46.890 --> 28:48.858
Kristen Hargis."Who are these people?

28:48.890 --> 28:51.779
A bank employee from SoHo,a developer from Chelsea,

28:51.830 --> 28:53.320
two Midtown real estateinvestors.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.998
Money people, basically.

28:55.030 --> 28:56.224
You think they're the oneswho help the gang

28:56.260 --> 28:58.490
launder their cash?Unlikely.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.930
By the time they show upon Bonzi's social media feed,

29:00.970 --> 29:03.131
these individuals werealready dead.

29:03.170 --> 29:04.967
WATSON:Most of the killings were

29:05.010 --> 29:07.103
run-of-the-mill streetcrimes, never solved.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.471
A carjacking,a couple of robberies.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.000
HOLMES:The messages we found

29:10.040 --> 29:13.544
make reference to themas examples.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.811
"J gonna end uplike Neal Watters.

29:16.850 --> 29:18.943
Take B Dog to Carol Logan."

29:18.990 --> 29:20.810
Once again, it is notthe dispositive proof

29:20.860 --> 29:22.350
the DA. is looking for,

29:22.390 --> 29:24.449
but we thinkthat they might be

29:24.490 --> 29:27.482
references to past hitscarried out by the gang.

29:27.530 --> 29:30.090
We're pretty sureall four were killed

29:30.130 --> 29:31.563
so that someone elsecould profit.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.794
Bonzi's half brother,

29:32.830 --> 29:34.092
Tyus Wilcox.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.960
His consulting firm would have

29:36.000 --> 29:37.160
put him in contactwith all of them.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.838
He must havewanted them dead.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.030
I don't understand.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.799
Why would Bonzi helphis little brother?

29:41.840 --> 29:42.807
They had a falling-out.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.807
They don't eventalk anymore.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.499
They allege to not talk anymore.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.949
And as you'll recall,their falling-out

29:46.980 --> 29:48.811
was quite public--staged ones often are.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.511
Okay, but they didn't needto pretend

29:50.550 --> 29:53.439
to hate each other for Bonzito do Tyus a few favors.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.583
We think that Bonzipunching Tyus

29:55.620 --> 29:57.850
wasn't about hidinga few favors.

29:57.890 --> 29:59.824
We think it was abouthiding a partnership.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.294
Tyus Wilcox is asmall-business guru.

30:02.330 --> 30:06.460
His brother's gang justmight be his biggest client.

30:06.500 --> 30:10.539
Last time we talked,I told you everything I knew.

30:10.570 --> 30:12.003
No, the last time wetalked, you left out

30:12.040 --> 30:14.577
the fact that you'rea criminal mastermind.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.538
Matthew Katzman,Kristen Hargis,

30:20.580 --> 30:24.038
Carol Logan,and Neal Watters.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.489
Now, we're stillconnecting the dots,

30:25.520 --> 30:27.044
but two of them were

30:27.090 --> 30:29.012
obvious rivals to yourconsulting business.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.255
The others workedin related fields

30:31.290 --> 30:33.155
and must havecrossed you somehow,

30:33.190 --> 30:35.988
so you had them killed by SBK.

30:36.030 --> 30:37.395
What is it gonna takefor you to understand

30:37.430 --> 30:39.193
I have nothing to do with SBK?

30:40.630 --> 30:42.188
All these people died

30:42.240 --> 30:44.037
during the last two years.

30:44.070 --> 30:46.504
You don't know them, but youknow the dates of their deaths?

30:46.540 --> 30:49.100
There's dates on these files.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.505
My point is thatyour department has been

30:53.550 --> 30:54.869
watching my brother like a hawk

30:54.920 --> 30:56.615
this whole time.

30:56.650 --> 30:57.548
Now, you guys know I haven'ttalked to my brother

30:57.580 --> 30:59.912
in two years.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.656
Not in person,not on the phone.

31:01.690 --> 31:04.488
You're dissembling.You communicate via

31:04.530 --> 31:07.181
viral memes andfascist codes.

31:07.230 --> 31:10.529
All of these posts weretaken from your brother's

31:10.560 --> 31:12.289
social media account.

31:12.330 --> 31:16.630
Each one has a filenamegenerated by an Enigma machine.

31:16.670 --> 31:19.002
I don't even knowwhat you're talking about.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.598
BELL:Come on, Mr. Wilcox.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.336
You're the real brainsin your family.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.540
We met Bonzi.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.901
He's a thugand a cokehead.

31:26.950 --> 31:29.578
But you, you're acomplex systems analyst,

31:29.620 --> 31:32.646
and all this ispretty complex.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.055
You said it yourself.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.617
My brother posts this stuff.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.287
HOLMES:Well, actually, he doesn't.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.150
Or at least he doesn't postall of it.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.999
We've just learned from CCS that

31:42.030 --> 31:44.396
the majority ofthose posts come

31:44.430 --> 31:46.990
from a masked IP address.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.669
So it's difficult to sayfor sure who posted them.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.669
Which made us wonder why
wouldyour brother use a proxy server

31:52.710 --> 31:53.608
to disguise the fact that

31:53.640 --> 31:55.073
he's giving orders

31:55.110 --> 31:56.998
to his gang sometimes,but not others.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.974
He wouldn't,

31:59.010 --> 32:00.375
which leads us to believe that

32:00.410 --> 32:02.469
you're not justyour brother's partner.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.283
You may just bethe man in charge.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.242
(laughs)I'll tell you what.

32:06.290 --> 32:07.689
I think thisdepartment is about

32:07.720 --> 32:10.450
to have a discrimination suiton its hands.

32:10.490 --> 32:12.981
Is that right?I'm discriminating against you?

32:13.030 --> 32:15.954
I don't know where elsethis could be coming from.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.298
I'm a businessman.I'm clean.

32:18.330 --> 32:20.719
I don't know these people

32:20.770 --> 32:22.738
and I sure as hell didn'ttell anyone to kill anyone.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.704
Now, as far as mebeing some sort of

32:24.740 --> 32:29.336
drug kingpin... nah.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.473
I'm an innocent man.

32:31.510 --> 32:33.444
Until we prove you guilty.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.040
(chuckles)

32:39.020 --> 32:41.159
Don't count on it.

32:41.190 --> 32:44.023
WATSON: So, what do you think?

32:44.060 --> 32:46.085
When Marcus listedthe names of the victims,

32:46.130 --> 32:48.496
"Carol Logan"got a rise out of him.

32:48.530 --> 32:51.522
He blinked twice, he shiftedhis weight and tilted his head.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.026
Well, lots of people squirm

32:53.070 --> 32:54.594
when they're accusedof multiple murders.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.766
True.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.529
But he was stock-stillfor the others

32:57.570 --> 33:00.505
and his haptic responsewasn't the only thing

33:00.540 --> 33:01.632
that doesn't fit the pattern.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.772
What do you mean?

33:02.810 --> 33:04.675
Well, SBK has been responsible

33:04.710 --> 33:06.371
for dozens of fatalities:

33:06.410 --> 33:07.547
gangland slayings,

33:07.580 --> 33:09.241
hits disguised as street crimes

33:09.280 --> 33:11.441
to benefit Tyus Wilcox.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.240
They're the kind of murders

33:12.290 --> 33:13.439
which don't garnerany headlines.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.048
And then there's Carol Logan.

33:15.090 --> 33:16.284
She was abducted,she was raped,

33:16.320 --> 33:17.719
dumped in a river.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.682
It is not the kind of crimethat he would design

33:19.730 --> 33:21.049
to quietly dispose

33:21.100 --> 33:22.351
of a business rival.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.061
BELL:So, you think it's just

33:24.100 --> 33:25.294
a coincidence that she worked

33:25.330 --> 33:26.695
at the branch where his business

33:26.730 --> 33:28.539
does its banking?I think it could be.

33:28.570 --> 33:30.561
How does he benefit

33:30.600 --> 33:31.737
from the deathof a mere bank teller?

33:33.110 --> 33:34.304
There's a loose thread there.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.329
We need to pull it.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.238
Where's your partner?

33:43.280 --> 33:45.748
He said he hadan errand to run.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.554
Come on, he's the one who wantedbreakfast burritos.

33:48.590 --> 33:50.319
We're not gonna be ableto eat right now, anyway.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.782
I've got to go get a warrant.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.422
What did you find?

33:53.460 --> 33:55.655
Carol Logan'skiller, I think.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.260
So, these pictures weretaken at her apartment

33:58.300 --> 34:00.165
when police were investigatingher disappearance.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.758
They found signsof a struggle.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.064
Two days later, they foundher body in the river.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.704
So, take a lookat this shot glass.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.300
It was a promotional item thatthey gave out at a launch party

34:09.340 --> 34:11.843
for a new tequilacalled Plata Fuego.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.472
The event took placeat a Chelsea club

34:13.510 --> 34:15.819
the same night thatCarol Logan was murdered.

34:15.850 --> 34:18.080
That's the only place youcould've gotten that shot glass.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.815
Last time Carol was seen alive,

34:19.850 --> 34:21.659
she was having dinnenNith friends.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.783
They said she told themshe was going straight home,

34:23.820 --> 34:25.685
but you think she lied, ditchedthem and went out dancing?

34:25.730 --> 34:29.552
I pulled thisfrom Plata Fuego's Web site.

34:30.530 --> 34:32.225
Look in the back corner.

34:33.870 --> 34:35.064
There's Carol Logan.

34:36.270 --> 34:37.828
Is she sittingwith Bonzi Folsom?

34:37.870 --> 34:39.531
Mm-hmm.Looks like he'scoming onto her

34:39.570 --> 34:41.800
and I don't seehis entourage anywhere.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.104
According to the gang unit,he'd like to slip away

34:44.150 --> 34:46.368
every once in a while and rubelbows with a different crowd.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.870
She invites him back to herplace, it all goes south,

34:50.920 --> 34:52.547
he rapes and kills her?

34:52.590 --> 34:54.854
Then after he goes home,he sends a message to his guys

34:54.890 --> 34:55.857
to get rid of her body.

34:55.890 --> 34:57.517
The important thing

34:57.560 --> 34:59.881
is that CSU collected DNAfrom the attacker,

34:59.930 --> 35:01.227
but they couldnever find a match.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.727
That makes sense.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.660
Bonzi had the one juvie arrest,

35:04.700 --> 35:06.497
but he's never takena collar as an adult.

35:06.530 --> 35:08.168
His DNA wouldn't bein the system.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.293
So, if we can pinCarol Logan's murder to Bonzi,

35:10.340 --> 35:12.137
that's life in prison.

35:12.170 --> 35:14.832
Might be enough leverageto get him to flip on Tyus

35:14.880 --> 35:17.440
and the rest of SBK.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.209
We'd be able to takethe whole gang down.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.447
Not that I wasn't happy to hearyou were in Bronxville,

35:22.480 --> 35:24.539
but why did you wantme to meet you here?

35:24.590 --> 35:27.479
I arrived a short while agoto test a theory.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.613
I think Luke Munro may haveused one of the chains

35:29.660 --> 35:31.389
on these swingsto choke Mira Tunney.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.228
As you can see, testing mytheory has proved impossible.

35:35.730 --> 35:38.699
So, whoever took themdid so a short while ago.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.163
There are footprints here.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.838
They were herein the last 24 hours.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.168
Question is who are they

35:44.210 --> 35:45.461
and why do thewant to protect

35:45.510 --> 35:47.205
the memoryof a dead teenager?

35:47.240 --> 35:48.502
(chuckles)

35:48.540 --> 35:51.179
And that amuses you?

35:51.210 --> 35:53.405
Well, no, it's just...

35:53.450 --> 35:55.839
you're messingwith me, right?

35:55.880 --> 35:58.314
You didn't send mea text yesterday?

35:58.350 --> 36:00.386
No.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.583
Around 3:00,I got this message.

36:03.620 --> 36:07.226
"Collect chainsfrom swing set

36:07.260 --> 36:08.625
"at home of LukeMunro's neighbor.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.628
"Test for blood evidence,likely murder weapon.

36:10.660 --> 36:11.922
S. Holmes."

36:11.970 --> 36:14.894
I didn't recognizethe number,

36:14.940 --> 36:16.589
but I thought maybeyou switched phones.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.903
Aanay, ifI had to guess,I'd say the prints are

36:20.940 --> 36:22.908
from the CSU investigatorwho took the chains

36:22.940 --> 36:24.749
into evidence last night.

36:24.780 --> 36:27.271
They're in a lab in WhitePlains now, getting tested.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.609
But if you didn't send thatmessage, who the hell did?

36:32.020 --> 36:34.784
Look alive, guys.It's right up here.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.357
(woman shouting in distance)You seem prettykeyed up, Detective.

36:37.390 --> 36:39.529
We're just serving a warrantfor a DNA sample, right?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.699
Yeah, another wayto look at it is

36:41.730 --> 36:43.994
we're about to tell the mostdangerous gangster in New York

36:44.030 --> 36:46.999
he has to incriminatehimself in a murder.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.863
WOMAN (sobbing):Bonzi! Bonzi, please!

36:49.900 --> 36:51.663
Police! We're coming in.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.359
WOMAN 2:It's about time.

36:53.410 --> 36:54.707
What took you guys so long?

36:54.740 --> 36:56.708
Whoa, relax.You don't need that.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.344
Everything's undercontrol now.What's going on?

36:58.380 --> 36:59.847
What are you doing here?EMT:What do you mean?

36:59.880 --> 37:01.370
We came on a medicaldistress call.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.376
We called for backup.That's not us.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.512
Whatever. We coulduse a hand.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.245
Guys, look around.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.348
Make sure the place is secure.

37:07.390 --> 37:08.687
Can you get somewater for this one?

37:08.720 --> 37:09.482
Try to calm herdown. She's upset.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.010
I need to get backto my partner.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.982
(crying):There was so much blood.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.021
He just wouldn't move!Slow down.

37:15.060 --> 37:16.550
Who wouldn't move?Bonzi!

37:16.600 --> 37:19.592
(crying): We were justhanging out, having some drinks.

37:19.630 --> 37:21.393
And so B says he'sgonna blow a few lines.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.862
Cocaine?

37:22.900 --> 37:24.299
He's got his private stash,

37:24.340 --> 37:25.034
the good stuffthat's just for him.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.935
He took two bumpsand he just...

37:26.970 --> 37:29.279
he started shakingand passed out.

37:29.310 --> 37:30.629
EMT: Can you helpus on the stairs?

37:30.680 --> 37:32.045
If we don't move right now,

37:32.080 --> 37:33.479
I don't think thisguy's gonna make it.

37:33.510 --> 37:35.569
Oh.

37:46.930 --> 37:49.490
We've done everything we can.

37:49.530 --> 37:50.690
I'm afraid Mr. Folsomis going to remain

37:50.730 --> 37:52.561
in a persistentvegetative state.

37:52.600 --> 37:55.728
There wasn't any meaningfulbrainwave activity on his EEG.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.465
I don't expecthim to recover.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.331
Has the toxicologyreport come back?

38:01.380 --> 38:05.407
No, but I think it'sgonna be interesting.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.419
I've seen plenty of ODs.Norma||y, with coke,

38:08.450 --> 38:11.647
a patient presents like somebodywho suffered cardiac arrest.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.419
They're drenched in sweat,

38:13.450 --> 38:14.781
but that's about it.

38:14.820 --> 38:15.809
This guy's eyes

38:15.860 --> 38:17.487
were really red.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.726
And it lookedlike there was

38:18.760 --> 38:20.819
a chemical burnin his nasal cavity.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.657
BELL:Pretty sure it was bleach.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.520
We found his stashat the scene,

38:24.570 --> 38:26.697
sent it to the lab sothey could test it,

38:26.730 --> 38:28.493
but I thought I smelledtraces of chlorine.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.394
Figure he got a hot shot.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.499
That's more likely thana regular user like Bonzi

38:32.540 --> 38:34.735
snorting cleaning suppliesby accident.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.845
(sighs)

38:39.880 --> 38:41.541
I wonder ist. Folsom knows

38:41.580 --> 38:43.343
that one of her boys justtried to kill the other.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.416
We can't be completelysure Tyus did this.

38:45.450 --> 38:48.613
WATSON:He has to be behind it.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.389
The timing istoo convenient.

38:50.420 --> 38:53.059
He knew we were taking anotherlook at Carol Logan's case.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.695
Well, he's probably afraidwe'd hang it on Bonzi,

38:55.730 --> 38:56.719
flip him on the gang,

38:56.760 --> 38:58.523
but now he's gotanother problem.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.767
Bonzi Folsom was a namethat rang out on the street.

39:01.800 --> 39:06.567
Most gangs, when they losetheir leader, they fall apart.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.999
WATSON: I'm not sure SBKhas lost its leader.

39:09.040 --> 39:13.602
Question is, how didhe dose Bonzi's coke?

39:13.650 --> 39:15.641
His lines of communicationwith the gang were cut off.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.671
He never got near Bonzi'sapartment last night.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.689
We know because the gang unithad it under surveillance.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.483
WATSON: If we'reright about this guy,

39:22.520 --> 39:25.728
he's been running one of themost dangerous gangs in New York

39:25.760 --> 39:27.125
from a Midtown officefor a decade.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.627
I'm sure he could figure out

39:28.660 --> 39:31.094
how to slip some bleachup his brother's nose.

39:31.130 --> 39:33.598
Maybe he'll tell us how.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.967
Ms. Folsom, we justwanted to say

39:39.010 --> 39:41.399
that you have our sympathiesfor your loss.

39:41.440 --> 39:44.546
My brother isn't dead.

39:44.580 --> 39:45.979
No, but close enough, right?

39:46.010 --> 39:49.639
(quietly): Mom,I'l| be right back, okay?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.991
That was rude.

40:04.030 --> 40:06.419
My mom doesn't needto hear that.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.563
I'm not the one who turnedher son into a vegetable.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.760
How'd you do it, Tyus?

40:09.800 --> 40:10.869
I didn't.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.733
This is a tragedy.I told you before,

40:13.770 --> 40:15.738
I've been worried for my brotherfor a while.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.633
This was bound to happen.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.170
Is that whyyou're so calm right now?

40:18.210 --> 40:20.747
When you're fromwhere I'm from...

40:21.820 --> 40:23.219
...you lose people.

40:23.250 --> 40:26.014
Bonzi isn't my firstor my favorite.

40:27.090 --> 40:28.148
So who wasyour favorite victim?

40:28.190 --> 40:29.418
Was it Shinwell?

40:31.760 --> 40:33.648
We know who you really are.

40:33.690 --> 40:35.157
We know that you did this.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.657
You're in the deepend now, Tyus.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.759
Your brother wasthe one everyone feared.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.166
I'd be carefulthese next few weeks.

40:42.200 --> 40:46.466
I could say the same thingto both of you.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.900
Apparently, I'm the guywho got your friend killed.

40:49.940 --> 40:51.100
The guy who overdosedhis own brother

40:51.140 --> 40:52.698
to stay out of jail.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.012
I can't imagine

40:55.050 --> 40:56.244
what I'd do to you.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.840
(scoffs)

41:09.800 --> 41:11.153
You wanted to see me?

41:11.200 --> 41:14.124
Yeah, I did.

41:14.170 --> 41:16.138
Not like you.

41:16.170 --> 41:19.105
You don't look good.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.937
There's a meetingin about an hour if you want.

41:20.970 --> 41:22.528
No, I don't wantto go to a meeting.

41:22.580 --> 41:23.808
Don't-Don't needto go to a meeting.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.274
"Need" is a relative term.

41:26.310 --> 41:29.814
I had to lie to a colleague ofmine today about this-this text

41:29.850 --> 41:31.647
that he received.

41:31.690 --> 41:36.514
I told him I didn't knowwho sent it, but...

41:36.560 --> 41:38.050
I think I do.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.719
That can't happen again.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.227
Then stop ignoring me.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.128
Things will get worse.

41:47.170 --> 41:49.832
(chuckles)That sounds like a threat.

41:49.870 --> 41:54.307
People who love each otherdon't make threats, Sherlock.

41:54.340 --> 41:55.705
They make promises.
