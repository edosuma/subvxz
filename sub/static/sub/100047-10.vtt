Do I look like I lead the kind of life

00:58.240 --> 01:00.240
- What d'you mean?
- I don't want any of you in my house.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.280
- [Jaq] You need to chill.
- [Taylor] I need to chill?

01:02.360 --> 01:04.000
- In my own house you're tellin' me that?
- [Jaq tsks]

01:04.080 --> 01:05.440
And don't kiss your teeth at me either.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.440

01:10.920 --> 01:11.840
Aight.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.160
Didn't have nowhere else to go.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.440
I couldn't exactly turn you away,
could I, Sully?

01:30.920 --> 01:33.440
But I do not want you in my house,
do you understand?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.000
You need to be gone by the time
Tash gets home from school.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.080
You think I want her to come home
and see me like this?

01:43.640 --> 01:44.720
Don't come back.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.200
I don't want you bringin' danger

Lizzie.

02:22.000 --> 02:22.920
How?

02:23.520 --> 02:25.280
She gets hold of her phone somehow.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.840
Or she had another phone.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.120
We didn't search her.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.040
She texts Jamie.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.600
Texts him and say what?

02:32.960 --> 02:33.960
The address.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.920
I didn't know the address.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.480
Did you?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.880
Jaq weren't there when it went down.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.040
It weren't Jaq.

02:47.120 --> 02:47.960
Why?

02:48.680 --> 02:49.800
She's loyal.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.240
Just trust me on that one.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.840
Well...

03:08.800 --> 03:10.640
Nah. No fuckin' way.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.680
Bruv, it better not be him.
That's all I'm sayin'.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
You know it don't fuckin' matter anyway.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.040
Bro, I just can't see a way out
right now, fam.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.400
There's always a way.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, well, I can't see it.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.640
That's all I'm sayin'.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.160
[tsks] Fuckin' underestimated
that yout, man.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.520
What, so now he's some
criminal mastermind?

03:47.600 --> 03:50.440
- That's not what I'm sayin'.
- That's what it sounds like you're sayin'.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.400
[sighs]

03:54.080 --> 03:55.480
Do you wanna know what I think?

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
He's a fuckin' kid.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.440
That lives in our borough.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.920
He wakes up every mornin'.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.640
He has a shit and a shower.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.480
And he ain't special.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.560
And we can get to him.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.480
Because there is always a way.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.320
Seriously, you need
to get your shit together.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.120
Figure this shit out.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.960
- [Jermaine] Yeah...
- [groans]

04:33.040 --> 04:34.480
He's got an issue with his eye.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.880
Yeah, he's managed to get some
boilin' water on his eyeball,

04:38.960 --> 04:42.000
and, erm, it seems to have
become infected.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.520
It's causin' a lot of pain and irritation,

04:44.600 --> 04:46.560
so I was just wonderin' if
you had anything.

04:46.640 --> 04:47.560
So, darlin'...

04:47.640 --> 04:51.040
[Jermaine] ...appointments or even
walk-ins are available or somethin'...

04:51.120 --> 04:55.320
Me and you need to have a conversation.

04:56.600 --> 05:01.760
I want you to introduce me to the people
that you work with.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.680
Do I really have to explain this to you?

05:04.760 --> 05:06.560
[Jermaine] All right, cool. Could you...

05:07.200 --> 05:08.640
In this business,

05:08.720 --> 05:11.440
how people avoid gettin' caught
and goin' to prison for 40 years...

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
is by being clever.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.280
They know me and they trust me.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.680
They don't know you
and they won't meet you.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.080
Well, you and I are gonna change that,
aren't we?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.400
[Jermaine] Yo, I got you a doctor.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.320
A top doctor still. Dr Cicero.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.400
He can fix your eye
and he's 20 minutes away.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.800
[Modie] Aight, by the time
that I come back,

05:39.880 --> 05:42.400
you're gonna tell me
everything that I wanna know.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.040
Yeah?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.920
[Modie] You sure this Dr Cicero
can fix my eye?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.840
[Jermaine] Yeah, bruv,
he can fix your eye.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.800
He's proper tings, bruv.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.960
Aight. Text me the address.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.920
We don't have to wear
our uniforms tomorrow.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.760
Yeah? Why?

06:08.440 --> 06:11.080
It's Non-School Uniform Day.
It's for charity.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.880

I'm gonna give you something for that.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.840
The important thing is to keep it clean.

Clean it with this before you go to bed,
when you wake up in the morning

10:19.880 --> 10:24.280

four times a day, five drops each time.

You restored their vision and that?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I think you're chatting shit
and you're a fuckin' liar.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.280
- We don't have fuckin' time for this!
- [Jermaine] Hang on, babe.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.840
Jamie, you got that tea, brother?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.160
Just a second, man.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.640
All right, safe.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.800
[Jermaine] Where's Dillian?

13:32.720 --> 13:35.320
Yeah, put him on the phone.
Let me talk to my little striker.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.200
What's happening, Champ?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.040
[suspenseful music playing]

13:43.120 --> 13:44.840
What d'you mean who's this?
Don't be cheeky.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.320

13:56.640 --> 13:57.800
[both grunting]

13:57.880 --> 13:59.320
[Jermaine] What the fuck you doin'?

13:59.920 --> 14:01.040
What are you doin'?

14:01.480 --> 14:03.640

14:03.720 --> 14:06.040

14:21.680 --> 14:22.840
You're finished, yeah?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.240
[Lizzie groans]

14:26.400 --> 14:28.000
- Come here! Come here!
- [Jamie groans]

14:28.240 --> 14:29.200
Get up!

14:30.280 --> 14:32.040
[panting]

14:32.120 --> 14:34.000
[Jamie grunts, yells]

14:38.280 --> 14:39.280
[Lizzie grunts]

14:41.120 --> 14:42.920

14:55.880 --> 14:56.760

[Lizzie coughs]

15:09.120 --> 15:10.200
[Jermaine] Jamie, wait!

15:11.840 --> 15:12.920
Modie's dead.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.760
Wait, bruv!

15:15.920 --> 15:18.080
[Jermaine] Modie's dead, bruv.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.280
[newsreader speaking indistinctly]

15:29.480 --> 15:30.640
[Lizzie coughs]

15:30.720 --> 15:32.280
[newsreader] ...he escaped four days ago

15:32.360 --> 15:35.320
when he was taken to hospital
for treatment for an eye injury.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.200
More on this story as we receive it.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.440
[kids yelling]

15:58.160 --> 15:59.600

Oi, listen.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.680
Jaq, you know that Stef yout?

16:18.120 --> 16:18.960
[Jaq] Mm-hmm.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.720
Is he still living in the house?

16:20.800 --> 16:21.680
[Jaq] Yeah.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.320
Him and his other brother.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.640
What?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.480
You wanna go after the brothers
or something?

16:30.400 --> 16:31.480
Who's the other brother?

16:32.280 --> 16:34.160
Aaron. He goes uni.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.840
Everyone says that he's a nice kid.
Don't bother with no one.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.360
And moretime, you already know that
Jamie's got CCTV at his entrance.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.840
By the time we get to his floor,

16:43.920 --> 16:46.000
ZTs be waitin' for us
when we get back down.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.760
[Sully] Why're you so interested
in the brothers?

16:52.480 --> 16:54.600
As you can see,
none of them's on the road.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.400
And I ain't harming no kids.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.600
Did anyone say anything
about harming kids?

17:02.360 --> 17:04.640
You said there's always a way, remember?

17:05.920 --> 17:07.000
But not this way.

17:08.920 --> 17:09.880
I mean it.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.440
[car engine starts]

18:34.960 --> 18:36.400
[electronic bell ringing]

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
Wah gwaan.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.040
Long time.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.080
I don't see your bredren.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.160
It's 'cause he didn't come.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.520
Thought you and Sully
were joined at the hip.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.560
Not all the time, no.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.720
Well, what can I do for you?

19:23.360 --> 19:24.600
I need some information.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.920
You know what I sell, Dushane.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.800
Need a car? I can rent you a car.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.800
You need a piece? I can get you a piece.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.920
I don't do information.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.040
Well, you're gonna have to this time.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.680
This is ballistic glass.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.880
Seventy-nine mil thick.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.280
It's actually made of two types of glass,

19:52.640 --> 19:54.240
one more elastic than the other,

19:54.320 --> 19:55.680
- so when it's hit...
- [sighs]

19:56.640 --> 19:57.680
...it don't shatter.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.080
It flexes and absorbs the impact.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.640
My car, my yard,
I got everything belled up.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.120
Cameras all over them.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.480
What I'm saying is you need to leave, now,

20:12.520 --> 20:14.960
and we can forget this conversation
ever happened.

20:15.040 --> 20:15.920
You finished, Ruben?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.440
I ain't trying to threaten you, bro.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.560
I wouldn't do that.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.560
- Name your price.
- Price for what?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.000
I don't know what you're buying.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.280
You hooked up CCTV for Jamie, didn't you?

20:35.200 --> 20:36.920
I need to see what Jamie sees.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.840
Name your price.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.360
There ain't no price. You need to leave.

20:44.760 --> 20:45.760
Yo!

20:48.080 --> 20:49.040
Listen.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.160
Me and you, we go way back, bro.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.920
We got history.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.160
We got respect.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Jamie and them man,
they don't give a shit about you, cuz.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.320
Now,

21:06.560 --> 21:07.880
name your price, Ruben.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.520
Yo, listen. Modie's dead.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.640
Yeah, we know.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.640
What about that pussy Jermaine?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.120
[Jamie] We ain't gonna hear
from Jermaine no more.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.520
- What happened to your face, man?
- Don't worry about that.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.720
We have one more person to take care of,
and that's Dushane.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.360
And that needs to happen today.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.280
Tell A-Road,
tell all of these other crews.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.440
I want everyone,
everywhere lookin' for him.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.680
Do you understand?

21:47.760 --> 21:52.560
If they see him, shoot him on sight,
no matter where the fuck he is.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.400
Finish him off!

21:55.480 --> 21:57.440
Come on, man! Let's fuckin' do this!

23:16.400 --> 23:18.320
Just tell me where I can find Dushane.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.440
Hey, Farah, give them your number.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.880
[Farah] Bruv, pass your phone.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.000

23:36.280 --> 23:39.480
You see Dushane, you see Sully,

24:51.320 --> 24:52.960
You lost me a lot of Ps, bruv.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.320
Now you gotta pay me back.

24:55.960 --> 24:56.800
So you got my Ps?

24:57.320 --> 24:58.200
No.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.480
Your mum got it?

[Jamie scoffs, chuckles]

25:58.680 --> 26:00.080
What you sayin', G?

26:00.680 --> 26:03.280
Where's Jermaine?
He ain't answering his phone.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.000
Bruv, why do you care
where Jermaine is, fam? Wah gwaan?

26:08.560 --> 26:10.280
Me and Jermaine had a deal, bruv.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.600

Fam, you know you fucked up, innit?

26:18.360 --> 26:19.640
[Jamie chuckles]

27:36.240 --> 27:37.200
[Aaron] Ay, shut up!

27:37.280 --> 27:39.080
[Abby] Tell your brother.
Why's he bein' like that?

27:39.160 --> 27:42.600
- If you put all the stalks together...
- [Aaron] I know what I'm doin', all right?

27:42.680 --> 27:45.000
- [Abby] Tell your brother to listen!
- [Stefan] He don't wanna listen.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.880
[Aaron] You're not even helpin'. Shut up.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.880

He's just tryin' to help. Hey, Ats!

[Stefan] My guy!

27:59.160 --> 28:00.480
Yo, wah gwaan! You good?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.720
[Abby] We're making chili.
There's tons if you want some.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.800
- [Stefan] It's not real chili, man.
- [Abby] It is!

28:04.880 --> 28:07.040
- It just doesn't have any meat.
- I ain't gonna lie.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.360
I'm not gonna like this ting.
Abby tryin' to do some vegan rubbish.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.840

Waffle.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.120
- It's a poem!

28:16.200 --> 28:18.160
'We must all love one another or die.'

28:18.480 --> 28:21.280
[Abby] Which I think is beautiful,
and it also applies to animals.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.760

28:23.840 --> 28:25.400

28:28.440 --> 28:29.800
[Abby] Leave him alone, Aaron.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.640
Can't lie, they're a bit mad.
I'mma have to give you one of mine still.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.000
Not gonna lie, those things
