00:01.758 --> 00:03.413
<i>Every generation</i> <i>
of every family</i>

00:03.482 --> 00:05.931
<i>wants its children to have</i> <i>
a better life.</i>

00:06.000 --> 00:07.931
<i>For many black families</i> <i>
in the '60s,</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:10.103
<i>a better life simply meant</i> <i>
being able to walk a dog</i>

00:10.172 --> 00:12.034
<i>instead of being chased</i> <i>
by them.</i>

00:12.103 --> 00:16.000
<i>For my family, a better life
meant a better education.</i>

00:16.068 --> 00:17.827
I talked to
your guidance counselor.

00:17.896 --> 00:18.896
He said
that volunteering

00:18.965 --> 00:20.862
for the Big Sister,
Little Sister program

00:20.931 --> 00:23.448
could help your college
application stand out.

00:23.517 --> 00:25.793
I've spent 12 years
as Dean's big sister.

00:25.862 --> 00:27.551
Shouldn't that count towards
community service?

00:27.620 --> 00:29.689
Spent the first two years
trying to send him back.

00:29.758 --> 00:31.517
Kept wasting good stamps.

00:31.586 --> 00:33.241
Well, I went to all
his stupid baseball games.

00:33.310 --> 00:34.724
You went to one game,

00:34.793 --> 00:36.620
and the one game
that you actually went to,

00:36.689 --> 00:37.931
you thought
I was another kid.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.448
You all wear
the same color shirts.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.172
This is a good thing,
and you're doing it.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.068
You might enjoy
having a Little Sister.

00:43.137 --> 00:45.068
I'm sure there's an
underprivileged girl out there

00:45.137 --> 00:46.448
who could learn a thing or two
from you.

00:46.517 --> 00:48.793
Like what?
How to hog the bathroom?

00:48.862 --> 00:50.896
Or how to fake-cry
to get yourself out of trouble?

00:50.965 --> 00:52.620
Shut up, Dean.
You know, that just shows

00:52.689 --> 00:54.517
how out of touch with women
you really are.

00:54.586 --> 00:57.413
Hey! I'm not out of touch
with women!

00:57.482 --> 00:59.517
Okay, now that Keisa and I
are friends again,

00:59.586 --> 01:02.103
my three-year plan to get her
to like me is back on track.

01:02.172 --> 01:04.413
<i>You poor,</i> <i>
delusional bastard.</i>

01:04.482 --> 01:07.241
Three years?
Are you out of your mind?

01:07.310 --> 01:09.379
By then, you'll be...

01:09.448 --> 01:10.655
"just a friend."

01:12.000 --> 01:13.206
Why?
Is being friends bad?

01:13.275 --> 01:15.000
Girls don't fall in love
with their friends.

01:15.068 --> 01:17.413
Yeah, my mom and dad
aren't friends at all.

01:17.482 --> 01:19.344
Are you going to ask her to
the Valentine's Day dance?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.896
Not as a friend?

01:20.965 --> 01:22.103
Check this out.

01:22.172 --> 01:24.068
Music. Dancing.

01:24.137 --> 01:26.689
The opening refrain to
"When a Man Loves a Woman".

01:26.758 --> 01:28.655
Then I'll reveal
my true feelings for Keisa.

01:28.724 --> 01:29.896
Hmm.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.758
- No?
- Don't listen to them, Dean.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.068
I'm on the dance's planning
committee,

01:34.137 --> 01:36.448
and this year's theme
will be perfect for your plan.

01:36.517 --> 01:38.724
I could tell you
the theme now,

01:38.793 --> 01:41.241
but I'd hate to
give away the surprise.

01:42.793 --> 01:46.172
Fine, it's "Under The Sea."
Happy?

01:49.482 --> 01:51.517
There she is.

01:51.586 --> 01:54.103
Here goes nothing.

01:54.172 --> 01:56.000
Not just a friend.

01:56.068 --> 01:57.620
Not just a friend.

01:57.689 --> 02:00.379
- Hey, you wanna race?
- Um, n-no.

02:00.448 --> 02:02.068
Don't worry.
I'll give you a head start.

02:02.137 --> 02:03.206
That's not why.

02:03.275 --> 02:04.724
Then why not?

02:04.793 --> 02:07.793
Uh, because I race with Cory
and Brad and those guys

02:07.862 --> 02:10.206
all the time, and, uh, you and I
can do other stuff.

02:10.275 --> 02:12.034
Like, I don't know,
maybe --

02:12.103 --> 02:14.103
Wait, you don't want to race me
because I'm a girl?

02:14.172 --> 02:15.379
Well, kinda, yeah.

02:15.448 --> 02:16.517
I throw better than you.

02:16.586 --> 02:17.586
- So?
- I kick the ball

02:17.655 --> 02:18.724
- better than you.
- Okay.

02:18.793 --> 02:20.034
We don't have time
to go through the whole list.

02:20.103 --> 02:22.379
C'mon, let's race.

02:22.448 --> 02:24.413
On your mark, get set...

02:26.068 --> 02:27.551
Dang.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.896
I was just about to
beat you, too.

02:28.965 --> 02:31.379
Do you want me
to carry your books?

02:31.448 --> 02:33.310
Do you want me
to carry yours?

02:33.379 --> 02:34.758
A-Allow me.

02:34.827 --> 02:38.724
Anyway, so, uh, Keisa,
I was wondering,

02:38.793 --> 02:39.896
do you have any plans
for the --

02:39.965 --> 02:41.241
Oh, I almost forgot.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.724
My parents signed me up
for Big Sister, Little Sister,

02:43.793 --> 02:45.103
and I picked Kim
as my mentor.

02:45.172 --> 02:46.896
What?
Wait, my sister?

02:46.965 --> 02:48.931
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.275
Whenever I saw your sister
with you,

02:50.344 --> 02:51.620
she always seemed
so cool.

02:51.689 --> 02:53.241
Keisa thought Kim was cool?

02:53.310 --> 02:55.448
<i>Maybe she wasn't as smart</i> <i>
as I always thought.</i>

02:55.517 --> 02:57.896
She even invited me over
after school today to meet.

02:57.965 --> 02:59.862
So, guess I'll see you
at your house later?

02:59.931 --> 03:02.931
Right. My house.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.034
So, what'd you want to
ask me?

03:04.103 --> 03:05.724
N-Nothing.
N-Nothing.

03:05.793 --> 03:08.379
<i>Wait, she's</i> <i>
gonna be in my house?!</i>

03:08.448 --> 03:10.000
<i>With my sister?!</i>

03:10.068 --> 03:12.379
Hey. You got my books,
remember?

03:14.586 --> 03:16.586
Kim,
please promise

03:16.655 --> 03:18.241
that you won't do anything
to embarrass me

03:18.310 --> 03:19.862
when my friend Keisa
comes over.

03:19.931 --> 03:21.758
Oh, it's that Keisa?

03:21.827 --> 03:23.379
Sure, I won't even
mention you.

03:23.448 --> 03:25.344
I'll leave the embarrassing part
up to you.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.379
Great. Thanks.

03:26.620 --> 03:29.068
<i>With Kim on my side
now, I just had to ensure</i>

03:29.137 --> 03:32.034
<i>my home field was wiped clean
of any other embarrassments --</i>

03:32.103 --> 03:34.896
<i>like a naked photo of me</i> <i>
as a baby.</i>

03:38.689 --> 03:41.551
<i>And another -- Did my parents</i> <i>
ever bother to dress me?</i>

03:41.620 --> 03:44.586
<i>Even the pictures
I drew of myself were naked.</i>

03:44.655 --> 03:46.172
<i>What kind of a freak was I?</i>

03:46.241 --> 03:48.862
<i>Great.
Nothing embarrassing left.</i>

03:55.413 --> 03:57.448
Okay.

04:01.655 --> 04:02.931
Hey, Keisa.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.103
Sorry, I completely forgot
you were coming.

04:05.172 --> 04:06.206
Uh, c'mon in.

04:06.379 --> 04:10.103
Dean! Why is your
dinosaur underwear in the oven?!

04:27.172 --> 04:28.931

I have a older brother.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.620
This is actually
his jacket.

04:30.689 --> 04:32.620
Oh. Well, how are you liking
school this year?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.517
It's been fun.
I have a lot of fun classes.

04:34.586 --> 04:36.344
Don't mind me.

04:36.413 --> 04:39.586
Just -- phew --

04:39.655 --> 04:43.448

One million and one,

04:47.310 --> 04:50.000
Hey, Keisa, look --
I'm about to set a new record.

04:50.068 --> 04:52.103
Okay, I know
what this is about.

04:52.172 --> 04:53.413
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

04:53.482 --> 04:55.620
Dean is clearly jealous

04:55.689 --> 04:57.896
that I'm spending time with you
instead of him.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.448
<i>The one time</i> <i>
I've ever benefited</i>

04:59.517 --> 05:01.172
<i>from Kim's narcissism.</i>

05:01.241 --> 05:03.034
C'mon,
let's go to my room.

05:08.448 --> 05:10.965
<i>As they entered
the abyss that was Kim's room,</i>

05:11.034 --> 05:13.448
<i>I knew I'd have to wait before</i> <i>
I got my moment alone</i>

05:13.517 --> 05:16.517
<i>with Keisa to ask her to</i> <i>
the dance.</i>

05:16.586 --> 05:20.000
So, Keisa...

05:20.068 --> 05:23.310
will you go
to the dance with me?

05:23.379 --> 05:25.344
No.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.862
So, Keisa...

05:27.931 --> 05:30.551
will you, uh, go to the dance
with me?

05:30.620 --> 05:33.172
Keisa.

05:33.241 --> 05:35.000
Will you go to
the dance with me?

05:36.482 --> 05:37.827
Nailed it.

05:40.655 --> 05:42.034
I knew I shouldn't eavesdrop,

05:42.103 --> 05:43.965
<i>but I couldn't resist</i> <i>
the temptation.</i>

05:44.034 --> 05:45.689
<i>For all I knew,
they could be talking about</i>

05:45.758 --> 05:47.862
<i>how much Keisa liked me.</i>

05:47.931 --> 05:50.000
This closet
is outta sight.

05:50.068 --> 05:51.827
I wish I had clothes
this cool.

05:51.896 --> 05:53.034
Where do
you like to shop?

05:53.103 --> 05:56.241
You know,
like, wherever.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.034
Two words -- swap meet.

05:58.103 --> 05:59.379
- Wow, really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:59.448 --> 06:01.068
They got great stuff.
We should go this weekend.

06:01.137 --> 06:04.206
We only buy new clothes
when school starts.

06:04.275 --> 06:05.551
Gotcha.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.551
Sometimes, my mom makes
my clothes.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.172
- Do you like that?
- No.

06:09.241 --> 06:11.275
I didn't think so.

06:11.344 --> 06:13.551
She wants me to dress all girly,
like her.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.068
Mm. Some things
you can always count on --

06:16.137 --> 06:18.689
like mothers having different
tastes than their daughters.

06:18.758 --> 06:20.275
And...

06:20.344 --> 06:21.896
<i>♪ All right</i>♪

06:21.965 --> 06:24.000

<i>♪ Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah</i>♪

06:27.655 --> 06:29.931
Maybe you don't have to wait
until next school year.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.931
Believe it or not,
I was your size once.

06:34.689 --> 06:36.206
<i>At dinner,</i> <i>
I eagerly awaited</i>

06:36.275 --> 06:38.172
<i>my opportunity.</i>
What's the matter, boy?

06:38.241 --> 06:40.275
- You okay?
- What do you mean?

06:40.344 --> 06:43.344
You aren't feeling constipated
again, are you?

06:43.413 --> 06:44.793
Sorry for the wait.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.034
We just wanted to freshen up
before dinner.

06:47.103 --> 06:48.413
<i>I didn't think</i> <i>
Keisa could get</i>

06:48.482 --> 06:52.896
<i>any more beautiful,</i> <i>
but, boy, was I wrong.</i>

06:52.965 --> 06:54.758
<i>Nothing in the world
could give me the confidence</i>

06:54.827 --> 06:56.724
<i>to talk to someone</i> <i>
that gorgeous.</i>

06:56.793 --> 06:58.896
Keisa,
you look lovely.

06:58.965 --> 07:01.758
Yes, very...lovely.

07:01.827 --> 07:04.068
Very in-indeed.

07:04.137 --> 07:05.724
He ain't right.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.344
<i>Then the worst
thing in the world happened.</i>

07:07.413 --> 07:09.862
<i>Mama and Daddy's parental</i> <i>
intuition kicked in,</i>

07:09.931 --> 07:12.379
<i>and they figured out
I had feelings for Keisa.</i>

07:12.448 --> 07:15.896
Dean, doesn't Keisa
look pretty?

07:15.965 --> 07:18.482
Uh -- Uh --
Uh -- Uh --

07:18.551 --> 07:19.620
Say something.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.206
I-I-I -- What I was going to say
is, I like dresses.

07:23.275 --> 07:26.068
O-- I mean,
I-I like that dress.

07:26.137 --> 07:28.724
O-On you.
Pretty.

07:28.793 --> 07:30.172
Stop saying something.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.655
Dean, didn't you mention
something about

07:31.724 --> 07:33.827
a dance
at your school?

07:33.896 --> 07:35.862
Uh, well, I, uh --

07:35.931 --> 07:37.758
Haven't I seen you practicing
your Hully Gully in the mirror?

07:37.827 --> 07:39.620
He's a bad man
on the dance floor.

07:39.689 --> 07:41.275
Sweepin' or moppin'?

07:41.344 --> 07:43.034
But school dances
are solid.

07:43.103 --> 07:44.793
- Are you going?
- Oh, I can't.

07:44.862 --> 07:47.206
My parents won't let me
date boys until I'm older.

07:47.275 --> 07:49.241
Ugh, I remember
those stupid rules.

07:49.310 --> 07:52.034
They aren't stupid.
I respect her parents for that.

07:52.103 --> 07:53.448
Boys ain't nothin'
but trouble.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.241
Be cool.

07:58.551 --> 08:00.068
Father...

08:00.137 --> 08:01.655
<i>
Jesus, please kill me.</i>

08:04.965 --> 08:07.758
Dang, man,
you missed your shot.

08:07.827 --> 08:10.275
Now every guy's
gonna be asking her.

08:10.344 --> 08:12.275
That there's
an eighth-grade boy, too.

08:12.344 --> 08:14.586
They already have
their man voices.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.000
- You're doomed.
- Doesn't matter.

08:17.068 --> 08:19.068
Her parents won't let her go
to the dance anyway.

08:19.137 --> 08:21.034
My parents have
the same rule,

08:21.103 --> 08:22.551
but they're okay
with me going to the dance

08:22.620 --> 08:24.517
as part of the committee.

08:24.586 --> 08:28.931
Hampton,
that's a great idea.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.413
Hey, Keisa.

08:30.482 --> 08:32.413
<i>My mind had never</i> <i>
worked so fast.</i>

08:32.482 --> 08:34.172
- Hey, what's up?
- I was thinking about

08:34.241 --> 08:35.413
what you said
about your parents

08:35.482 --> 08:36.689
saying you couldn't go
to the dance,

08:36.758 --> 08:37.827
but how you really wanted
to go.

08:39.103 --> 08:40.586
And then I realized
that Hampton and I

08:40.655 --> 08:42.034
are on
the dance committee.

08:42.103 --> 08:43.172
We are?

08:43.241 --> 08:45.068
Yes. We are.

08:45.137 --> 08:48.103
Right. We are.

08:48.172 --> 08:49.172
You should join.

08:49.241 --> 08:52.551
Then we -- I mean,
you can go to the dance.

08:52.620 --> 08:53.586
While Hampton secretly prayed

08:53.758 --> 08:56.862
<i>for forgiveness for lying,</i> <i>
I prayed for a miracle.</i>

08:56.931 --> 08:59.448
Oh, got it.
Sounds like fun.

08:59.517 --> 09:01.758
I'll ask my parents after school
if I can join.

09:01.827 --> 09:04.275
Thanks for the idea.
See ya.

09:05.931 --> 09:08.931
- Hampton, that was amazing!
- What did I do?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.241
If Keisa joins the committee,
she can still go to the dance,

09:11.310 --> 09:12.931
and I can still reveal
my true feelings to her.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.034
It's perfect.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.896
Oh.
Y'all are serious?

09:19.965 --> 09:21.482
Well, y'all two
have fun with that.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.965
Hey, Little Man.

09:26.034 --> 09:28.034
<i>Perry Barlow --</i> <i>
the most perfect boy</i>

09:28.103 --> 09:29.241
<i>in all of junior high.</i>

09:29.310 --> 09:30.931
<i>Man, he had it all.</i>

09:31.000 --> 09:32.034
So, what's the deal
with that girl

09:32.103 --> 09:33.862
you was talking to
back there?

09:33.931 --> 09:35.551
Anyone taking her
to the dance yet?

09:35.620 --> 09:37.448
<i>
Nice try, Perry,</i>

09:37.517 --> 09:39.862
<i>but only a man with a plan</i> <i>
can get to Keisa.</i>

09:39.931 --> 09:42.448
Sorry, her parents
won't let her date boys.

09:42.517 --> 09:43.620
They're real religious.

09:43.689 --> 09:45.931
Got it.
Thanks for the skinny.

09:50.586 --> 09:51.827
<i>
Keisa's parents decided</i>

09:51.896 --> 09:53.241
<i>she could join the committee,</i>

09:53.310 --> 09:55.172
<i>but they still wanted her under</i> <i>
their watchful eye</i>

09:55.241 --> 09:57.862
<i>if she was going to work</i> <i>
after school with boys.</i>

09:57.931 --> 09:59.896
Great job on
those waves, Keisa.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.448
You clearly studied
the references

10:01.517 --> 10:02.758
I gave you
this morning.

10:02.827 --> 10:04.758
Look, guys!
I'm a walrus!

10:04.827 --> 10:08.068
Arr-arr-arr-arr-arr-arr!

10:08.137 --> 10:10.379
If you're gonna play around,
use a flat-top,

10:10.448 --> 10:11.896
not our Filberts.

10:11.965 --> 10:13.931
Everything was going to plan.

10:19.482 --> 10:21.655
<i>What in the Barlow</i> <i>
is he doing here?</i>

10:21.724 --> 10:23.000
Hello. Are you
Keisa's mother?

10:23.068 --> 10:24.586
I am.
And you are?

10:24.655 --> 10:25.896
My name
is Perry Barlow.

10:25.965 --> 10:27.517
I go to school
with your daughter.

10:27.586 --> 10:28.862
May I please speak
with your husband?

10:28.931 --> 10:33.241
Lucious, there's a young man
from Keisa's school at the door.

10:37.517 --> 10:39.379
Sorry.
We don't want anything.

10:39.448 --> 10:41.241
Oh, I'm not
selling anything, sir.

10:41.310 --> 10:43.896
I'm here because there's
a Valentine's Day dance

10:43.965 --> 10:47.172
coming up at school, and I'd
like to ask for your permission

10:47.241 --> 10:49.000
to go to the dance
with your daughter.

10:50.448 --> 10:52.068
<i>Uh-oh, kid.</i> <i>
You're in for it now.</i>

10:52.137 --> 10:53.379
I understand
you have concerns

10:53.448 --> 10:54.931
with your daughter
going out with a boy,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.931
so I wanted to speak with you
face-to-face.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.344
My father, Dr. Barlow,
will be taking us.

10:59.413 --> 11:02.586
He drives
a 1964 Lincoln Continental.

11:02.655 --> 11:05.551
Keisa will be home by 10:00,
or even earlier, if you'd like.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.034
If you have any questions
about me,

11:07.103 --> 11:08.482
I believe you know
Reverend Tucker?

11:09.724 --> 11:10.793
I babysit his children.

11:11.931 --> 11:13.241
Well,
you're right, son.

11:13.310 --> 11:15.034
It is our rule that Keisa
can't date

11:15.103 --> 11:16.724
until she turns
at least 13.

11:16.793 --> 11:19.793
But you seem like
a polite young man,

11:19.862 --> 11:22.620
and it's nice to see kids that
are respectful to their elders

11:22.689 --> 11:24.413
and know how
to talk to grown folk.

11:24.482 --> 11:25.862
- Good teeth, too.
- Thank you.

11:25.931 --> 11:28.241
- I noticed that.
- Mm.

11:28.310 --> 11:31.620
Maybe we'll leave it
up to Keisa to decide.

11:31.689 --> 11:35.172
Keisa! There's a young man
that want to ask you something.

11:40.896 --> 11:43.000
Keisa, will you go
to the dance with me?

11:49.275 --> 11:51.379
Yes, I'd love that.

11:51.448 --> 11:53.448
Great. I'll be here
by 7:00 to pick you up.

11:53.517 --> 11:55.551
I can't wait.
Thank you.

11:55.620 --> 11:56.758
I understood why her parents

11:56.827 --> 11:57.965
<i>would fall for his charade,</i>

11:58.034 --> 12:00.551
<i>but I couldn't believe</i> <i>
Keisa fell for it, too.</i>

12:00.620 --> 12:03.241
<i>Why would she want to go
to the dance with that guy?</i>

12:03.310 --> 12:07.896
<i>Just because he was tall and
handsome and loved the Lord.</i>

12:07.965 --> 12:09.620
<i>[sighs]</i> <i>
Who was I kidding?</i>

12:09.689 --> 12:11.206
<i>I would have loved</i> <i>
for my daughter</i>

12:11.275 --> 12:13.241
<i>to have dated someone</i> <i>
like Perry Barlow.</i>

12:13.310 --> 12:16.241
So, guess I can't be a part
of the committee anymore.

12:16.310 --> 12:20.241
But don't worry, I'll still help
you guys finish up tonight.

12:20.310 --> 12:22.896
It's getting late.
Y'all need to be going.

12:22.965 --> 12:25.103
Keisa, c'mon.

12:25.172 --> 12:27.482
Sorry, guys.

12:27.551 --> 12:28.931
Poor Keisa.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.068
Can you believe she's gonna
miss out on all this fun?

12:36.793 --> 12:39.758
My man.
First dance tonight.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.379
You know what? Your curfew's
extended until 10:00.

12:42.448 --> 12:44.551
- Cool.
- You meeting Keisa there,

12:44.620 --> 12:45.689
or are you guys
picking her up?

12:45.758 --> 12:48.103
Actually, I'm not going
with Keisa.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.517
I never asked her,
and now she's going

12:50.586 --> 12:52.517
- with an eighth grader.
- Then who are you going with?

12:52.586 --> 12:53.896
I'm on
the planning committee.

12:53.965 --> 12:56.344
Be home by 8:00.

12:56.413 --> 12:58.517
Don't laugh.

12:58.586 --> 13:01.068
This is all your fault
for giving Keisa a makeover.

13:01.137 --> 13:02.896
Now all the other guys
like her.

13:02.965 --> 13:05.517
Do you have a problem with a
girl feeling good about herself

13:05.586 --> 13:08.310
and not being dependent on you
for her self-esteem?

13:08.379 --> 13:09.586
No.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.344
Well, all I did was give Keisa
a dress and a bit of makeup.

13:12.413 --> 13:14.586
As her friend,
you should be happy for her.

13:14.655 --> 13:16.931
Okay. I don't have time
for this, all right?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.931
Hampton asked me to go
to the drug store

13:19.000 --> 13:21.517
and get him some
last-minute decorations.

13:21.586 --> 13:24.758
Apparently, our ocean backdrop
isn't turquoise enough

13:24.827 --> 13:26.448
to match the Atlantic.

13:34.137 --> 13:35.689
Hey, Dean. <i>
Perfect.</i>

13:35.758 --> 13:38.172
<i>As if I hadn't been
embarrassed enough already.</i>

13:38.241 --> 13:40.379
Hey, Keisa.
What are you doing here?

13:40.448 --> 13:42.103
Oh, just looking for
some stuff.

13:42.172 --> 13:43.862
But I couldn't find it.

13:43.931 --> 13:45.931
<i>Wow. She couldn't</i>
even <i>look me in the eye</i>

13:46.000 --> 13:47.103
<i>after what she did to me.</i>

13:47.172 --> 13:48.827
<i>Must have been</i> <i>
her guilty conscience.</i>

13:48.896 --> 13:50.862
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.586
C'mon,
I'll walk you out.

13:53.655 --> 13:56.275
Stop right there.

13:56.344 --> 13:57.689
I saw you steal
that makeup.

13:57.758 --> 13:59.862
- What are you talking about?
- What?

13:59.931 --> 14:01.620
She would never
do something like that.

14:04.965 --> 14:06.482
What's this?

14:09.241 --> 14:10.758
You're both
coming with me.

14:10.827 --> 14:12.103
Let's go.

14:19.724 --> 14:22.068
Okay.

14:22.137 --> 14:25.000
You two sit here and wait
for your parents to show up.

14:31.482 --> 14:34.551
I'm sorry.

14:34.620 --> 14:39.068
I don't get it.
W-Why were you stealing?

14:39.137 --> 14:41.689
Was it 'cause of
the money?

14:41.758 --> 14:43.965
<i>All of the years</i> <i>
I'd known Keisa,</i>

14:44.034 --> 14:46.275
<i>I didn't notice that she never</i> <i>
wore new clothes</i>

14:46.344 --> 14:48.448
<i>or always had to borrow</i> <i>
my comic books</i>

14:48.517 --> 14:50.275
<i>instead of buying her own.</i>

14:50.344 --> 14:53.827
People kept saying the new
things made me look pretty.

14:55.586 --> 14:57.689
Well...

14:57.758 --> 15:02.000
I-I always thought you were
pretty the way you were.

15:06.793 --> 15:09.689
My dad's gonna kill me
when he finds out.

15:33.172 --> 15:35.206
They're right back here.

15:35.275 --> 15:38.103
Caught the girl stealing makeup.
The boy served as a decoy.

15:46.586 --> 15:47.827
Let's go.

15:50.689 --> 15:53.758
I am so incredibly sorry for
what they put you through today.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.068
I assure you, they'll
get a thorough talking-to

15:56.137 --> 15:58.413
when we go home.
Come on, let's go.

15:58.482 --> 16:01.896
Whoa. I c-- I can't let two kids
go with another kid.

16:01.965 --> 16:04.000
They can either wait for
their parents or the police.

16:04.068 --> 16:06.586
Sir, I really appreciate
your concern,

16:06.655 --> 16:08.827
but our parents
will be working late.

16:08.896 --> 16:10.344
I can save you
the trouble.

16:10.413 --> 16:12.000
They'll just have to
wait, then.

16:12.068 --> 16:13.620
As Kim fought to get us out,

16:13.689 --> 16:15.896
<i>it became clear to me that,</i> <i>
in a way,</i>

16:15.965 --> 16:18.103
<i>she felt responsible</i> <i>
for what had happened.</i>

16:18.172 --> 16:21.275
<i>When this started, it was just
a line on a college résumé.</i>

16:21.344 --> 16:23.793
<i>But now she realized she was</i> <i>
in over her head,</i>

16:23.862 --> 16:26.620
<i>and it was her job</i> <i>
to make this right.</i>

16:28.448 --> 16:31.241
This is all my fault.

16:31.310 --> 16:33.275
I was responsible
for them today,

16:33.344 --> 16:35.758
and I wasn't paying
enough attention.

16:35.827 --> 16:39.206
And now look at them.
They're felons.

16:39.275 --> 16:43.896
Our parents work so
hard to keep us out of trouble,

16:43.965 --> 16:47.551
and they were relying on me
to be a good big sister.

16:47.620 --> 16:51.068
But instead,
I disappointed everyone.

16:51.137 --> 16:52.931
<i>Now I had seen
enough of Kim's fake tears</i>

16:53.000 --> 16:55.379
<i>to know what she was doing,
but everyone else seemed to be</i>

16:55.448 --> 16:58.758
<i>buying it, so I was fine just
shutting up and nodding along.</i>

16:58.827 --> 17:01.103
I'll be happy to pay
for what they took.

17:01.172 --> 17:04.379
Fine.

17:04.448 --> 17:06.517
But y'all are never allowed back
in this store again.

17:06.586 --> 17:07.689
- You hear me?
- Thank you

17:07.758 --> 17:09.206
for understanding, sir.

17:13.448 --> 17:15.620
Thank you, Kim.

17:15.689 --> 17:18.241
Were my parents mad
when you told them?

17:18.310 --> 17:20.620
Girl, I didn't tell anyone
anything.

17:20.689 --> 17:22.758
So, Mom and Dad don't know
about this, either.

17:22.827 --> 17:25.172
Nope. I just pretended
to be Mom on the phone

17:25.241 --> 17:26.551
when the store clerk
called.

17:26.620 --> 17:28.896
- They have no idea.
- Thanks.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.586
But that doesn't mean
I can't tell them later

17:30.655 --> 17:31.758
about what you did.

17:31.827 --> 17:33.379
Please don't punish Dean.

17:33.448 --> 17:35.344
He didn't do
anything wrong.

17:35.413 --> 17:37.586
This is all my fault.

17:37.655 --> 17:40.000
This probably means
you won't be my Big Sister

17:40.068 --> 17:41.517
anymore, doesn't it?

17:41.586 --> 17:44.413
No. This doesn't change
anything.

17:44.482 --> 17:46.689
Just, next time you need
something,

17:46.758 --> 17:48.275
make sure
you come to me.

17:48.344 --> 17:51.413
It's what big sisters
are for.

17:51.482 --> 17:54.034
But don't you ever
do that again.

18:02.586 --> 18:05.172
<i>Kim saved us
from real trouble that day.</i>

18:05.241 --> 18:08.068
<i>That was the first time
I remembered being thankful</i>

18:08.137 --> 18:09.517
<i>to have a big sister.</i>

18:09.586 --> 18:11.103
Thank you, Kim.
It was really cool

18:11.172 --> 18:12.758
how you fooled
that guy back there.

18:12.827 --> 18:13.896
You're welcome.

18:14.103 --> 18:17.000
And by the way, strong women
should never resort to crying

18:17.068 --> 18:19.551
unless no one was there
to see it.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.931
Right?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.758
Oh -- Oh.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.172
Now c'mon.

18:24.241 --> 18:26.689
Dance starts in two hours,
and you gotta get ready.

18:26.758 --> 18:30.931
And, Dean, you need
a bath bad.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.827
<i>♪ I love you, girl</i>♪

18:49.896 --> 18:51.758
<i>♪ Don't you understand?</i>♪

18:51.827 --> 18:54.206
Have fun.

18:54.275 --> 18:57.034
Well, look who it is.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.655
Hi, Dean.
Nice to see you again.

18:59.724 --> 19:01.379
Uh, have you met
my boyfriend?

19:03.482 --> 19:05.931
Anyway, it looks like
you have a busy night,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.586
so we won't keep you.

19:07.655 --> 19:10.103
We'll just be off, you know,
movin' and groovin'.

19:14.482 --> 19:16.896
Ah, isn't it magical?

19:16.965 --> 19:19.379
All of our hard work
has finally paid off,

19:19.448 --> 19:21.068
and you've got the best job
in the house.

19:21.137 --> 19:23.931
You get to see everyone's faces
as they first lay eyes

19:24.000 --> 19:25.965
on our underwater fantasy.

19:27.827 --> 19:29.724
"Fanta-sea."

19:29.793 --> 19:31.241
That would have been

You really did a great job
with these decorations.

Hope you dance
your socks off.
