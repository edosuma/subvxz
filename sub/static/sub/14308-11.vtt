00:12.333 --> 00:14.800
MY FAVORITE DAY

00:14.833 --> 00:16.767

IS CREEPING NEAR,

00:16.800 --> 00:19.367
SO EVERYBODY BEST BEWARE

00:19.400 --> 00:22.100

00:22.133 --> 00:24.633
- HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

00:25.667 --> 00:27.233

00:38.467 --> 00:41.133
- COOL.
CAN I BE PART OF THE HAUNT?

00:41.167 --> 00:42.633
PLEASE.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.733
YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH US,
ESPECIALLY ON HALLOWEEN.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.100
TONIGHT, YOU WILL SEE
THE PRESTON MEN

00:48.133 --> 00:51.100
SCARIER THAN YOU'VE
EVER SEEN US!

00:53.900 --> 00:55.767
- LOOK, I DREW A SMILEY FACE
ON THIS APPLE

00:55.800 --> 00:57.300
USING RAINBOW SPRINKLES.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.833
- I GAVE MINE

00:58.867 --> 01:00.700
MARSHMALLOW EYES
AND A JELLYBEAN NOSE.

01:00.733 --> 01:03.433
BOOP!

01:03.467 --> 01:07.800
- EEK.
SOMEBODY SAVE ME.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.767
- WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS?

01:09.800 --> 01:11.833
- TAYLOR'S HAVING
A BIG HALLOWEEN PARTY,

01:11.867 --> 01:13.700
AND WE PLANNED
SOME REALLY COOL TRICKS.

01:13.733 --> 01:16.567
JIGGLING SKELETONS.
- FLOATING CANDY CORN.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.167
- AND THE SCARES
JUST KEEP ON COMING.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.167
- YOU GUYS, MY PARTY
IS CREATING MAJOR BUZZ.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.667
NOT TO BE AN OVERLY
DRAMATIC TEEN,

01:25.700 --> 01:27.767
BUT THIS EVENT
COULD LITERALLY MAKE OR BREAK

01:27.800 --> 01:29.800
MY ENTIRE SOCIAL LIFE!

01:29.833 --> 01:33.433
- WHOA, PRINCESS,
BACK IT UP.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.300
HALLOWEEN IS OUR HOLIDAY.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.600
TONIGHT, IT'S ALL ABOUT
US GETTING OUR SCARE ON.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.367
- LOUIE, I'M LOOKING
FOR A FUN PARTY,

01:39.400 --> 01:40.733
NOT SCARRING MY GUESTS
FOR LIFE.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.533
- SHE'S RIGHT, SON.

01:42.567 --> 01:45.500
WE LIVE WITH THE HATHAWAYS NOW,
MADE A PROMISE NOT TO HAUNT.

01:45.533 --> 01:48.733
- I DIDN'T!
I JUST SPENT THE LAST TWO WEEKS

01:48.767 --> 01:52.200
MASTERING HOW TO TURN MYSELF
INTO A GIANT SCORPION!

01:55.733 --> 01:56.800
UGH!

01:56.833 --> 01:58.633
I'LL BE IN MY PLAYPEN.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.433
CRIB!

02:00.467 --> 02:02.367
ROOM!

02:06.967 --> 02:09.700
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:09.733 --> 02:12.567
* YOU'VE GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:12.600 --> 02:14.667
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:14.700 --> 02:18.633
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:18.667 --> 02:20.867
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:20.900 --> 02:22.500
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:22.533 --> 02:25.367
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:25.400 --> 02:28.233
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:28.267 --> 02:30.233
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:30.267 --> 02:33.833
*

02:33.867 --> 02:36.100
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:36.133 --> 02:37.633
*

02:41.833 --> 02:43.633
- YOUR BROTHER'S STILL
REFUSING TO COME DOWN.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.300
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THIS UPSET BEFORE.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.500
HE'LL CHEER UP

02:47.533 --> 02:49.233
AS SOON AS HE SEES
THIS SCARECROW,

02:49.267 --> 02:50.467
BECAUSE AT THE PARTY,

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
PUMPKIN-HEAD
WILL BE DOING A DANCE

02:52.533 --> 02:54.333
THAT GOES A LITTLE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.433
HEH, WATCH ME NOW.

02:58.467 --> 03:02.433
HEY! HO! HEY! HO!

03:02.467 --> 03:04.300
UH, UH, UH!

03:04.333 --> 03:06.533
ER, ER, ER, ER.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.200
I'M HOPING
A LITTLE BIT OF MYSELF

03:09.233 --> 03:11.100
COMES THROUGH
IN THE PERFORMANCE.

03:11.133 --> 03:14.467
- OH, YOU COME THROUGH
LOUD AND CLEAR.

03:19.133 --> 03:23.100
I'VE COME
FOR YOU, TAYLOR HATHAWAY.

03:23.133 --> 03:25.333
- AH, SO SCARY!

03:25.367 --> 03:27.267
NICE TRY, FRANKIE.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.767
YEAH, FRANKIE, SUPER LAME.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.633
- THAT'S THE FIFTH COSTUME
YOU TRIED ON.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.400
WHICH ONE ARE YOU
GOING TO WEAR?

03:35.433 --> 03:37.133
- ALL OF THEM.

03:37.167 --> 03:39.333
- SHE FINDS THE HOUSES
THAT GIVE OUT THE MOST CANDY

03:39.367 --> 03:42.700
AND KEEPS HITTING THEM UP
IN DIFFERENT COSTUMES.

03:42.733 --> 03:46.300
- MY RECORD HAUL WAS 24 POUNDS,
BACK IN '09.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.233
GOOD TIMES.

03:49.233 --> 03:50.800
- AMAZING NEWS, FAMILY.

03:50.833 --> 03:53.433
THE LOCAL TV STATION IS DOING
A PIECE ON NEW BUSINESSES,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.733
AND GUESS WHO THEY WANT
TO INTERVIEW TONIGHT?

03:55.767 --> 03:57.167
MOI.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.667
- ARE YOU FORGETTING
WHAT HAPPENED

03:58.700 --> 04:00.600
LAST TIME "MOI" WAS
INTERVIEWED ON CAMERA?

04:00.633 --> 04:03.533
IT WAS DEADLY.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.333
- MA'AM, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING IN LINE

04:05.367 --> 04:06.533
FOR TICKETS TO LOVE LAKE?

04:08.133 --> 04:12.367
- OH, DUH--
UH, CAMERA--PEOPLE--MOVIE--

04:12.400 --> 04:14.133
AH!

04:14.167 --> 04:17.300
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME, RIGHT?
WEIRDO!

04:17.333 --> 04:20.667
THAT NEWS CREW AMBUSHED ME.
THIS TIME, I WILL BE PREPARED.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.167
I HOPE SO.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.500
IT WAS A TRAIN WRECK.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.567
- YOU WANT TO BE GROUNDED,
REAPER?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.467
- NO, MOMMY.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.200
- MICHELLE,
YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN,

04:33.233 --> 04:36.367
ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
THE TRUE MEANING OF HALLOWEEN.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.100
- I SUPPOSE.
- CAN I INTEREST YOU

04:38.133 --> 04:39.700
IN EYEBALLS
RAINING FROM THE CEILING

04:39.733 --> 04:41.167
DURING YOUR TV INTERVIEW?

04:41.200 --> 04:45.100
MIGHT BE A NICE TOUCH.
AM I RIGHT?

04:45.133 --> 04:47.433
- LOUIE, I'M REPRESENTING
A FAMILY BAKERY.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.333
THERE WILL BE NO HAUNTING.

04:49.367 --> 04:53.133
- SO I'VE MISJUDGED YOU THEN.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.333
- WELL, I'VE GOT TO GET
CAMERA-READY.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.067
- AND I HAVE TO GET CHANGED.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.633
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER!

04:59.667 --> 05:03.800
- YEAH,
FOR EVERYBODY BUT ME.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.533
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS ONE?

05:09.567 --> 05:11.467
I'M A NEW YORK STRONGMAN.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.267
GIVE ME
THE CANDY, OR I GIVE YA A SMACK.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.633
OH!

05:16.833 --> 05:18.767
NOTHING?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.600
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S HALLOWEEN,

05:20.633 --> 05:23.667
AND I'M STUCK BEING
A COSTUME CONSULTANT.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.867
- I TOLD YOU
I'D HELP YOU HAUNT.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.533
- PLEASE,
YOU'RE A LITTLE GIRL.

05:28.567 --> 05:31.167
HEY! WHOA!
LOOK AT THE GUY WITH THE MOUTH!

05:31.200 --> 05:34.267
LIL' RESPECT, HUH?

05:35.700 --> 05:37.500
- HEY GUYS,
I GOT SOME GREAT STUFF

05:37.533 --> 05:40.467
FROM GHOST WORLD FOR THE PARTY.
CHECK OUT THIS GHOST WHISTLE.

05:44.267 --> 05:48.300
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
THIS IS WAY TOO SCARY.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.333
"AGES SIX AND UP?"
MY LEFT FOOT.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.167
EVERYONE OKAY?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.267
- YOU JUST CAME
OUT OF THAT MIRROR!

05:56.300 --> 05:59.500
- YEAH, THAT'S OUR PORTAL
TO GHOST WORLD.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.167
- THAT'S THE COOLEST THING EVER!

06:02.200 --> 06:04.833
I JUST THOUGHT YOU GUYS ZAPPED
TO GHOST WORLD AND BACK.

06:04.867 --> 06:09.400
YEAH, FRANKIE,
'CAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.667
ANYWAY, LOUIE, DON'T FORGET
WE NEED YOU DOWNSTAIRS

06:11.700 --> 06:13.567
IN 30 MINUTES
TO POP BALLOONS.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.333
NOW, THAT'S FUN
FOR ALL AGES.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.833
- I'D GIVE ANYTHING
TO BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

06:20.867 --> 06:23.100
TO PULL OFF
MY OWN HALLOWEEN SCARE.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.533
I NEED SOMEBODY LIKE THIS.
CHECK OUT THIS AD.

06:26.567 --> 06:28.833
- "CALL ON GRUESOME GLENDA.

06:28.867 --> 06:31.467
"NEED AN ALL-POWERFUL GHOST
TO HELP FREAK OUT A MORTAL?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.133
SIMPLY DRAW A RED DOOR
RIGHT ON YOUR PORTAL."

06:34.167 --> 06:36.667
WHAT DO YOU NEED HER FOR?
YOU GOT ME.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.100
- NOT THE SAME.

06:38.133 --> 06:42.533
- FINE, SUIT YOURSELF.

06:42.567 --> 06:46.233
HAPPY HALLOWEEN,
BALLOON-POPPER.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.267
- I AM NOT A BALLOON-POPPER!
I'M A GHOST IN MY PRIME!

06:59.300 --> 07:02.533
AND IT'S TIME I STARTED
ACTING LIKE ONE.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.533
- WELL, AREN'T YOU
A CUTIE PATOOTIE?

07:22.667 --> 07:24.567
YES, I AM.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.400
BUT WHAT?

07:27.433 --> 07:28.700
WHO ARE YOU?

07:28.733 --> 07:30.833
- I'M GLENDA THE GOOD GHOST.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.467
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
A GRUESOME

07:32.500 --> 07:34.400
ALL-POWERFUL SCARE EXPERT,

07:34.433 --> 07:37.133
NOT SOME GIRL WITH A PURSE
AND A FRIENDSHIP BRACELET.

07:37.167 --> 07:39.200
- OH, WHEN I SAY "GOOD,"
I MEAN...

07:39.233 --> 07:42.367
VERY GOOD.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.300
YOU'RE MY HERO.

07:59.533 --> 08:03.567
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

08:05.333 --> 08:08.533
- IT'S A COSTUME, EMMA,
JUST LIKE YOURS.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.800
- RIGHT, COSTUME.

08:10.833 --> 08:13.167
I'M DRESSED THIS WAY
BECAUSE IT'S HALLOWEEN,

08:13.200 --> 08:16.200
NOT BECAUSE I GOT MY HEAD
STUCK IN A BUCKET.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.567
- TAYLOR, HUGE NEWS!

08:20.600 --> 08:23.400
THE WORD IS THE NINTH GRADE
BOYS' SWIM TEAM MIGHT SHOW UP.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.467
AMAZING!

08:27.500 --> 08:30.800
- I'M SO GLAD
I DID MY HAIR.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.633
- MILES.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.533
WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE?

08:35.567 --> 08:39.067
I'M 1/4 OF A BARBERSHOP QUARTET.

08:39.100 --> 08:43.233
* HELLO, HELLO, HELLO

08:43.267 --> 08:46.067
- YEAH, SO CAN WE GET
THIS SCARE SHOW ON THE ROAD?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.200
- * YOU GOT IT, TAY--

08:48.233 --> 08:49.267
- MILES.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.667
LET'S DO IT!

09:05.167 --> 09:07.333
- TAYLOR,
THAT WAS SO COOL!

09:07.367 --> 09:09.267
- I KNOW.
HOW ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS?

09:09.300 --> 09:12.467
- HEY, A ZOMBIE CHEERLEADER
NEVER DIVULGES HER SECRETS.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.133
AND IF I DID,
I'D HAVE TO EAT YOUR BRAINS.

09:16.167 --> 09:19.200
- GOOD LOOK FINDING MY BRAINS.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.100
'CAUSE I'M WEARING
A BUCKET.

09:21.133 --> 09:24.133
- I GET IT.
- YES, THAT'S WHY.

09:25.867 --> 09:28.300
- SO WE'LL START WITH WHY
YOU DECIDED TO OPEN

09:28.333 --> 09:29.800
YOUR BAKERY
HERE IN NEW ORLEANS.

09:29.833 --> 09:31.300
- WELL, THAT ANSWER WILL BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

09:31.333 --> 09:34.367
GET IT, CAKE?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.867
- ARE YOU GONNA WEAR
THAT SHIRT?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.733
- OH, UM--

09:37.767 --> 09:40.400
OH, HI, HONEY, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE DOING GREAT OUT THERE.

09:40.433 --> 09:42.233
- OH, ARE YOU
A LITTLE EINSTEIN?

09:42.267 --> 09:43.700
HEY, WHOA! LIL' RESPECT!

09:43.733 --> 09:46.767
OH, WAIT, I CHANGED.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.367
NOW UPSTAIRS
FOR COSTUME NUMBER THREE.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.433
- SHE IS QUITE A PISTOL.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.833
YEAH, MY GIRLS ARE MY LIFE.
BAKING'S REALLY MY SECOND LOVE.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.733
THAT BEING SAID, I NEVER
TAKE FOR GRANTED THE FACT,

09:56.767 --> 09:58.800
THOUGH, THAT I GET TO OWN
AND RUN MY OWN BUSINESS.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.367
HEY, THAT SOUNDED
PRETTY GOOD.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.133
- IT WAS GREAT.
KNOW WHAT?

10:02.167 --> 10:04.700
LET'S JUST LIVE WITH THE SHIRT
AND GET THIS ON CAMERA.

10:04.733 --> 10:07.100
- OH--
- AND ACTION.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.367
I'M HERE
WITH MICHELLE HATHAWAY,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.200
BUSINESS OWNER,
BAKER, MOTHER.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.267
MICHELLE,
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

10:15.900 --> 10:19.133
- UH--UH--

10:19.167 --> 10:21.467
BAH!

10:25.467 --> 10:27.767
- I FEEL LIKE MY FAMILY
DOESN'T GET ME.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.767
IT'S LIKE
I'M A LONELY CASTAWAY

10:29.800 --> 10:31.900
STRANDED ON "ME ISLAND."

10:33.200 --> 10:34.500
WOW.

10:34.533 --> 10:37.700
I WASN'T PREPARED
TO OPEN THAT DOOR.

10:37.733 --> 10:40.200
- WELL, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING
BY CALLING ME.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.033
EVERY GHOST DESERVES
AN AMAZING HALLOWEEN.

10:43.067 --> 10:46.300
- GREAT. SO I'M THINKING
SPIDERS, MOANING.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.367
AND IF AN EYEBALL
DROPS FROM THE CEILING,

10:48.400 --> 10:51.033
I WON'T COMPLAIN.

10:54.633 --> 10:57.733
OH, SWEETIE,
YOU'RE THINKING TOO SMALL.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.633
WE'RE GONNA SCARE
THESE HATHAWAYS SO BADLY,

10:59.667 --> 11:01.767
THEY'LL TREMBLE IN FEAR.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.867
AND NEVER
ENTER THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

11:05.900 --> 11:09.167
OKEYDOKEY?

11:09.200 --> 11:10.367
- UH--

11:13.233 --> 11:16.267
- OH, MAN, MY DAD.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.800
- HEY, BUDDY.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.733
WE MISS YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

11:19.767 --> 11:21.367
WHO'S THIS?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.100
- NO WAY.

11:23.133 --> 11:26.367
I HAVE THE SAME
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.133
- HUSH UP, BOW TIE.

11:28.167 --> 11:29.833
I'M GLENDA.

11:29.867 --> 11:31.600
AND THIS POOR KID
SUMMONED ME HERE

11:31.633 --> 11:34.400
BECAUSE THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE DEPRIVED HIM OF GHOSTING.

11:34.433 --> 11:37.533
I WOULDN'T SAY SUMMONED.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.600
I-I DREW A DOOR.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.067
- WELL, IT'S TIME
FOR BOTH OF YOU

11:43.067 --> 11:45.500
TO REFLECT
ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.700
LET US OUT RIGHT NOW.

11:52.733 --> 11:55.067
- DON'T THEY LOOK SILLY
IN THERE?

11:55.067 --> 11:57.100
- NO, WE NEED
TO LET THEM OUT.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.367
- BUT THE FUN'S
JUST GETTING STARTED.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.400
IT'S TIME TO GET RID
OF THESE HATHAWAYS FOREVER.

12:07.367 --> 12:09.100
- SO--

12:09.133 --> 12:12.300
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.467
TIME TO GET
THIS PARTY STARTED.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.833
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

12:32.867 --> 12:34.533
- JUST 'CAUSE
I LIKE TO SCARE

12:34.567 --> 12:36.600
DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T
LOOK CUTE DOING IT.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.500
- LOOK, GLENDA.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.167
JUST GIVE ME THE KEY
TO THE PORTAL

12:41.200 --> 12:43.233
SO I CAN
LET MY FAMILY OUT NOW.

12:43.267 --> 12:45.233
- FINE! GOSH.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.267
OH, BUT ONE SMALL THING.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.133
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME

12:49.167 --> 12:51.333
AND TAKE IT FROM ME FIRST!

12:54.167 --> 12:55.467
- ALL RIGHT.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.767
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.333
UNSTOPPABLE
BALL OF ENERGY!

13:04.267 --> 13:05.767
LOOK AT ME NOW.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.233
SCARED?
YOU SHOULD BE.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.300
SO UNCOOL!

13:17.233 --> 13:20.367
- THAT'S DEFINITELY
YOUR BEST SIDE, KIDDO.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.733
I'M LOVING THIS LIP GLOSS.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.700
- HOPE YOU'RE
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

13:27.733 --> 13:28.867
RAY!

13:28.900 --> 13:31.700
HEY, HAVE MORE PUNCH.

13:31.733 --> 13:32.833
MILES!

13:32.867 --> 13:34.267
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

13:34.300 --> 13:36.300
I'M DYING OUT HERE.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.767
- TAY, THE SWIM TEAM
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.167
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.400
THE PARTY
STARTED OFF GREAT,

13:41.433 --> 13:42.600
BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE BORED.

13:42.633 --> 13:44.633
- SUSAN, DON'T BE RUDE.

13:44.667 --> 13:46.467
WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY WAS,

13:46.500 --> 13:48.767
"TAY, YOUR PARTY STINKS."

13:49.900 --> 13:51.333
- DON'T WORRY.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.233
I HAVE SOME AMAZING THINGS
COMING UP.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.233
MILES.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.333
- TAYLOR, OVER HERE.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.833
- UH, EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

13:59.867 --> 14:02.533
- LOUIE, WHERE ARE MILES
AND RAY?

14:02.567 --> 14:04.400
I'M LOSING THESE PEOPLE.

14:04.433 --> 14:05.767
- TAYLOR, FORGET THE PARTY,

14:05.800 --> 14:08.300
AND GET YOUR FRIENDS
OUT OF THIS HOUSE NOW.

14:09.633 --> 14:11.600
- I MAY HAVE UNLEASHED
AN EVIL SUPER-GHOST

14:11.633 --> 14:13.800
WHO'S BENT
ON TOTAL DESTRUCTION.

14:13.833 --> 14:17.400
- CAN I JUST
HAVE ONE NORMAL DAY?

14:17.433 --> 14:19.300
- OH, NO.
THERE'S THE SHE-DEVIL.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.333
SHE'S HERE!

14:21.367 --> 14:23.333
- WAIT. THAT'S WHO
YOU'RE SCARED OF?

14:23.367 --> 14:24.800
- HI, SWEETIE.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.567
DOES YOUR PAR-TAY
NEED A LITTLE PICK

14:27.600 --> 14:29.133
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.500
CAN YOU WHIP UP
SOMETHING FUN?

14:30.533 --> 14:32.733
- NO, SHE'S GONNA
RUIN YOUR ENTIRE--

14:36.733 --> 14:38.867
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE JUST THE ILLUSION

14:38.900 --> 14:41.267
FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.367
- LOVE HER.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.467
HEY, EVERYONE.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.400
TRICK OR TREAT?

14:51.233 --> 14:53.433
- EVERYONE OUT.
GO, GO, GO.

14:53.467 --> 14:56.833
[all screaming,
electricity buzzing]

14:58.267 --> 15:00.767
COOL BEANS.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.900
I'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND GET EVERYONE IN ONE ROOM,

15:02.933 --> 15:04.600
AND THEN IT'S TIME
TO TERRIFY.

15:04.633 --> 15:07.600
COME ON. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
WANNA MISS THIS.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.633
- FRANKIE,
I NEED YOUR HELP!

15:15.667 --> 15:17.600
- SORRY, MADAME, NO DICE.

15:18.933 --> 15:21.333
GET IT?

15:21.367 --> 15:24.133
BESIDES, OLD PEOPLE START
TO GO TO SLEEP AROUND NOW

15:24.167 --> 15:26.700
AND LEAVE THEIR BOWLS
OF CANDY OUT ON THE PORCH.

15:26.733 --> 15:28.700
- BUT BAD THINGS ARE ABOUT
TO HAPPEN TO ALL OF US.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.367
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.167
- BUT I'M JUST
A LITTLE GIRL.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.200
- OKAY,
I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

15:35.233 --> 15:38.233
I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY EARLIER COMMENTS.

15:38.267 --> 15:39.700
- SAY, "FRANKIE'S AWESOME."

15:39.733 --> 15:41.167
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.767
- SAY IT!
- FRANKIE'S AWESOME.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.900
- OKAY.
I FORGIVE YOU.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.600
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

15:46.633 --> 15:50.400
- TO APOLOGIZE AND MAKE YOU
COME UP WITH THE PLAN.

15:54.733 --> 15:57.367
- DIDN'T WORK
THE FIRST FOUR TIMES, SON.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.133
- BUT WE HAVE TO STOP
THAT CRAZY GIRL

15:59.167 --> 16:01.867
WITH THE AWESOME
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.300
I HOPE YOU HAVE
A SUITABLE PUNISHMENT

16:06.333 --> 16:07.667
LINED UP FOR LOUIE.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.367
- EH, NO ONE'S
GETTING PUNISHED, MILES.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.133
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

16:12.167 --> 16:13.533
IT WAS MINE.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.567
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:16.867 --> 16:18.633
LIVING WITH THE HATHAWAYS
IS TRICKY.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.767
I WANNA RESPECT
OUR ARRANGEMENT,

16:20.800 --> 16:22.467
BUT I MIGHT HAVE
LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT

16:22.500 --> 16:23.733
THAT LOUIE'S A LITTLE KID
MISSING OUT

16:23.767 --> 16:25.333
ON HIS FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

16:25.367 --> 16:29.667
I WANNA RAISE GOOD SONS
BUT ALSO HAPPY GHOSTS.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.200
- YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY POPS.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.667
I READ YOU MY JOURNAL ENTRIES
EVERY DAY.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.833
- YES. YES, YOU DO.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.433
I GUESS THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT WAIT.

16:43.467 --> 16:47.567
- OR PASS THE TIME
WITH A BARBERSHOP CLASSIC.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.733
* HELLO, MY BABY,
HELLO, MY HONEY *

16:49.767 --> 16:52.133
* HELLO, MY RAGTIME GAL

16:52.167 --> 16:53.633
- AAH.

16:58.767 --> 17:04.367
- AND THAT'S HOW THE DONUT
GOT ITS NAME.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.467
INVENTED BY BOB DONUT.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.300
AHH.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.867
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.367
I TOTALLY JUST
MADE THAT UP.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.133
- OH, NO, MICHELLE,
THAT WAS REALLY--

17:15.167 --> 17:16.500
NOT GOOD.

17:16.533 --> 17:19.233
THIS IS ALL UNUSABLE.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.467
- I KNOW.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.567
- WHO HAS AN ELEVATOR
IN THEIR HOUSE?

17:27.600 --> 17:30.400
- NEVER MIND.
EVERYBODY OUT.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.367
- NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.900
WHY I'M YOU.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.733
- UH-OH.
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

17:51.767 --> 17:56.233
HAPPY HALLOWEEN, HUMANS.

17:56.267 --> 17:58.767
- AW. YOU TOO, MRS. H.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.867
SHE'S THE BEST.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.200
HE'S YOUR SAVIOR?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.200
HOW SAD.

18:12.233 --> 18:14.133
- SAD FOR YOU.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.467
THE L-TRAIN IS HERE

18:15.500 --> 18:17.433
TO TEACH YOU
A LESSON IN MANNERS.

18:17.467 --> 18:18.833
- HM. HOW'S THIS--

18:18.867 --> 18:23.233
GROWING DONKEY EARS,
PLEASE.

18:23.267 --> 18:26.133
- NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND...
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,

18:26.167 --> 18:29.267
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE TO
FACE THE MUSIC.

18:34.433 --> 18:36.233
SO SCARY.

18:36.267 --> 18:39.233
LET ME SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.700
- BOO!

18:48.400 --> 18:50.700
- EH, WE GAVE IT A SHOT.

18:50.733 --> 18:52.467
- LOUIE, YOU HAVE
SERIOUSLY GOT TO BE

18:52.500 --> 18:54.600
THE WORST GHOST EVER.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.133
LOUIE?

18:57.167 --> 18:59.433
- I MAY NOT BE
A LEVEL TEN GHOST,

18:59.467 --> 19:02.900
BUT AT LEAST I DIDN'T FALL
FOR THE OLD DIVERSION TRICK.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.800
- MY KEY.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.200
THAT MEANS--

19:06.233 --> 19:09.500
- I UNLOCKED THE MIRROR!

19:12.800 --> 19:15.767
I'M RAY,
ALSO A LEVEL TEN GHOST.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.633
AND YOU MESSED
WITH MY FAMILY,

19:17.667 --> 19:20.567
MY WHOLE FAMILY.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.833
- YEAH, AND I'M MILES.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.567
TRICK OR TREAT, GLENDA?

19:24.600 --> 19:28.867
OH, AND WE'RE FRESH
OUT OF TREATS.

19:28.900 --> 19:32.733
- UM, GUYS, ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE TRAPPED OVER HERE, SO--

19:32.767 --> 19:35.667
- OKAY, GLENDA,
TIME TO GO.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.800
- BOYS,
LET'S SHOW HER THE EXIT.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.533
WHAT'S NEXT,
YOU'RE GONNA PATTY

19:45.567 --> 19:47.267
OOH!

19:49.500 --> 19:52.500
WHOA, WHOA!

19:56.767 --> 19:57.933
- THIS IS SO WORTH
MISSING OUT

19:57.967 --> 20:00.233
ON OLD PEOPLE CANDY.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.600
- ALL RIGHT, LOUIE.

20:01.633 --> 20:05.933
SEND HER ON...HER...WAY!

20:05.967 --> 20:07.933
- COPY THAT, POPS.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.533
GLENDA, OUT!

20:10.567 --> 20:12.700
IT WORKED!

20:12.733 --> 20:15.400
- WE DID IT.
- YEAH, WE DID.

20:15.433 --> 20:17.800
THE PRESTON BOYS
BROUGHT IT TONIGHT!

20:17.833 --> 20:19.767
- BEST HALLOWEEN EVER.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.900
COME ON.

20:21.933 --> 20:25.233
- HEY, GUYS, I JUST WANNA SAY,
THIS PARTY...

20:27.167 --> 20:29.567
- THAT WAS AWESOME!

20:29.600 --> 20:31.833
- WENT EXACTLY
HOW I PLANNED IT.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.467
- I WAS SCARED
FOR A MINUTE,

20:33.500 --> 20:35.533
BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY
THE PARTY OF THE YEAR.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.267
- YEAH, OR MAYBE EVEN
THE MONTH.

20:39.733 --> 20:42.267
- EVERYBODY,
LET'S GO BACK UPSTAIRS.

20:44.467 --> 20:48.667
- SO, DID I MENTION
WE ALSO CATER WEDDINGS?

20:56.500 --> 20:57.800
TO EVERYBODY

20:57.833 --> 21:00.133
FOR WHAT I DID TONIGHT.

21:00.167 --> 21:01.400
- NO WORRIES, LOUIE.

21:01.433 --> 21:05.433
I'M PRETTY SURE
I ROCKED THAT INTERVIEW.

21:05.467 --> 21:07.733
- THE CAMERA IS BROKEN.
THE FOOTAGE IS LOST.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.167
- YES!

21:10.200 --> 21:12.133
- AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.200
ONCE WE SAWED THE BUCKET
OFF EMMA'S HEAD,

21:14.233 --> 21:16.300
EVERYONE HAD A GREAT TIME.

21:18.167 --> 21:19.667
- DAD, MILES,
ARE YOU TWO GOOD?

21:19.700 --> 21:21.233
- AH, FORGET ABOUT IT.

21:21.267 --> 21:23.467
DAD AND I ACTUALLY HAD
SOME NICE BONDING TIME.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.233
- WE SURE DID.

21:25.267 --> 21:27.300
HIT IT!

21:28.733 --> 21:30.300
- * HELLO, MY BABY

21:30.333 --> 21:31.833
- * HELLO, MY HONEY

21:31.867 --> 21:35.667
both: * HELLO,
MY RAGTIME GAL *

21:35.700 --> 21:37.433
WE HAD
A LOT OF TIME IN THERE.

21:37.467 --> 21:39.167
- BUM, BUM, BUM.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.100
* SEND ME A KISS

21:41.133 --> 21:42.300
- * BY WIRE

21:42.333 --> 21:43.733
- * BABY, MY HEART'S ON

21:43.767 --> 21:46.567
- * FIRE

21:48.133 --> 21:50.167
YEP, I THINK THEY LEFT.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.800
- WE LOST 'EM.
