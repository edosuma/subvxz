WEBVTT

00:00.177 --> 00:01.697
Previously on "30 Rock".

00:02.330 --> 00:03.797
Say you approve of Criss.

00:03.831 --> 00:05.098
I'm in your head.

00:05.133 --> 00:07.317
Why did you have to offend the
gay community?

00:07.352 --> 00:10.003
Did you just call me an idiot
on this TV?

00:10.038 --> 00:13.774
Tracy has organized a protest
of NBC by his fellow idiots.

00:13.808 --> 00:15.325
Mr. Hornberger?

00:15.360 --> 00:16.476
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

00:16.511 --> 00:18.997
But I know someone who does.

00:20.632 --> 00:21.648
Talk to me.

00:28.856 --> 00:30.824
They're still mad?

00:30.858 --> 00:32.893
We sent Elton and David a
honey-baked ham.

00:32.927 --> 00:34.161
What more do they want?

00:34.195 --> 00:36.063
I'm joined now by one gay
rights advocate

00:36.097 --> 00:38.966
who isn't sure Jordan and NBC
have learned their lesson.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.167
Devin Banks, welcome.

00:40.201 --> 00:41.235
Thank you, Dallas.

00:41.269 --> 00:42.836
I have seen you
since Michael Kors'

00:42.870 --> 00:44.271
new year's Eve masquerade.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.739
Uh, I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:45.773 --> 00:48.041
Right. Let's dive in.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
Banks.

00:56.484 --> 00:58.752
Hey, try this. New recipe.

00:58.786 --> 01:00.254
We have to talk.

01:00.288 --> 01:01.555
How fresh is that dog?

01:01.589 --> 01:04.340
Yesterday, that was the face,
feet and colon of a pig.

01:04.375 --> 01:06.093
I'm so fired up, Liz.

01:06.127 --> 01:07.160
I got some cash now.

01:07.195 --> 01:08.295
I can finally make
a down payment

01:08.329 --> 01:09.763
on a real food truck.

01:09.797 --> 01:10.847
Yeah, the van's not great.

01:12.767 --> 01:13.717
All right, kids.

01:13.768 --> 01:14.718
Who wants some?

01:14.769 --> 01:15.802
Get in my van.

01:15.836 --> 01:17.271
Is there a problem, officer?

01:17.305 --> 01:18.855
But you can't take that money.

01:18.890 --> 01:20.173
What, why not?

01:20.191 --> 01:22.876
Because the guy who
wrote you the check...

01:22.910 --> 01:24.811
He's my boss and he
doesn't really care

01:24.845 --> 01:28.315
about the hot dog truck or
locally sourced pig sweepings.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.751
He just needed an
excuse to meet you.

01:30.785 --> 01:32.536
Wait a minute, you know Jack?

01:32.570 --> 01:34.087
Why would he want to
pay $10,000 to meet me?

01:34.122 --> 01:35.255
Because I didn't
want him to meet you.

01:35.290 --> 01:36.723
He inserts himself
into my business

01:36.758 --> 01:37.958
whether I want him to or not

01:37.992 --> 01:39.710
and now he's inserting
himself into this.

01:39.744 --> 01:40.827
Well, that's what
she said, but...

01:40.862 --> 01:43.930
Why wouldn't you want
him to meet me?

01:43.965 --> 01:45.065
You're embarrassed
of me?

01:45.099 --> 01:46.917
No, it's not me, it's him.

01:46.968 --> 01:49.703
I didn't want him to lecture me
about how you don't have a job

01:49.721 --> 01:52.205
and your name is spelled wrong
and you went to Wesleyan.

01:52.223 --> 01:54.574
Wesleyan is the Harvard of
central Connecticut.

01:54.609 --> 01:56.443
Yale is the Harvard
of central Connecticut.

01:56.477 --> 01:58.278
Had that locked and loaded,
didn't you?

01:58.313 --> 01:59.446
Well, you know what?

01:59.480 --> 02:00.447
This isn't a Jack problem.

02:00.481 --> 02:01.565
I think this is a Liz problem.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.683
Because you wouldn't care what

02:02.717 --> 02:04.818
he thought unless
you agreed with him.

02:04.852 --> 02:05.819
Like you're so perfect.

02:05.853 --> 02:06.987
Let's not do this.

02:07.021 --> 02:07.988
You don't say cholesterol
correctly.

02:08.021 --> 02:08.989
"Chloresterole."

02:09.023 --> 02:11.258
You're a 41 year old woman
who cheats at board games.

02:11.292 --> 02:13.493
You don't use the tab closures
on cereal boxes.

02:13.528 --> 02:16.330
If you think those are doing
anything to seal in freshness,

02:16.364 --> 02:18.231
you are living in a fantasy
world, pal.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.833
Forget it.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.668
This was a good day, Liz.

02:21.703 --> 02:23.253
I'm gonna be in
the park meditating.

02:23.287 --> 02:24.638
What would Jack say about that?

02:24.672 --> 02:26.473
He'd say, "good God, Lemon."

02:26.507 --> 02:27.507
Locked and loaded.

02:33.581 --> 02:35.982
Good God, Lemon.

30 ROCK
Ep 03 - Idiots Are People Three

02:52.317 --> 02:55.817
Sync and corrected by dr. jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:59.374 --> 03:01.041
I'll have you know the
last man who wore jeans

03:01.075 --> 03:03.110
in this office was named
Theodore Wrangler.

03:03.144 --> 03:04.778
And you, Banks,
could not even

03:04.796 --> 03:08.114
carry his trademark,
floor-length, suede cape.

03:08.132 --> 03:09.949
I was wondering when
I'd hear from you, Jack.

03:09.967 --> 03:13.487
Do you know what comes up on my
phone when you call?

03:13.521 --> 03:15.121
Where did you get that?

03:15.139 --> 03:16.590
The only copy of
that photograph is in

03:16.624 --> 03:18.792
Stephanie Seymour's
safety deposit box.

03:18.810 --> 03:22.496
You have bigger things to
worry about, Jack.

03:22.530 --> 03:25.499
See, I've got you right
where I want you.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.633
Really?

03:26.667 --> 03:27.967
You think you have
leverage here?

03:27.985 --> 03:29.703
The news cycle is
done with Tracy.

03:29.737 --> 03:31.438
They've moved on
to a story about

03:31.472 --> 03:33.190
teenagers huffing
other teenagers.

03:33.241 --> 03:35.308
Tracy's apologies have
been accepted by GLAAD

03:35.343 --> 03:36.309
and I don't even know
what organization

03:36.344 --> 03:37.310
you're here representing.

03:37.345 --> 03:38.829
We're new,
we're called PEEN.

03:38.863 --> 03:40.080
And what is that
an acronym for?

03:40.114 --> 03:41.248
Acronym?

03:41.282 --> 03:42.649
Okay, you've succeeded in

03:42.683 --> 03:44.150
annoying me and wasting my time.

03:44.168 --> 03:45.452
But your 15 minutes is up.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.854
And...you've got nothing.

03:47.889 --> 03:49.089
Really?

03:49.123 --> 03:51.291
Nothing?

03:51.325 --> 03:55.512
See that little Tracy Jordan
gem that I leaked last night

03:55.546 --> 03:58.331
was just the tip of
the iceberg, Jack.

03:58.349 --> 04:01.835
And NBC is the <i>Titanic.</i>

04:01.869 --> 04:03.670
The highest grossing
movie of all time!

04:03.704 --> 04:05.505
The boat, not the movie,
the boat!

04:05.540 --> 04:07.641
See, I've been following Tracy's
standup act for months

04:07.675 --> 04:09.543
now and if any of this gets out,

04:09.577 --> 04:11.411
every protected
group in America's

04:11.446 --> 04:13.513
gonna be picketing this network.

04:13.531 --> 04:14.548
Enjoy.

04:16.868 --> 04:18.517
Good God.

04:18.536 --> 04:20.454
Oh, is this one about how
asians act on the subway?

04:20.488 --> 04:22.622
I know, I almost threw up
the first time I heard it.

04:23.658 --> 04:24.624
Oh, this one's fun.

04:24.659 --> 04:25.725
Starts out as a joke about our

04:25.760 --> 04:26.710
first Mexican President.

04:26.744 --> 04:27.894
My Lord.

04:27.929 --> 04:29.629
And ends up as just a rant
against women.

04:29.664 --> 04:30.897
Oh...

04:30.932 --> 04:32.966
No one can ever listen to this.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.751
Then she had teeth down there!

04:36.587 --> 04:38.255
What do you want, money?
A job?

04:38.306 --> 04:40.173
This isn't a
business play, Jack.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.475
I mean, what's the point.

04:41.509 --> 04:43.908
After going head to head with
you for the last five years,

04:43.909 --> 04:45.779
I've ended up as a house
husband in Brooklyn.

04:45.813 --> 04:47.314
You won, Jack.
So what are you saying?

04:47.348 --> 04:50.100
I've given up trying to beat
you in the board room.

04:50.151 --> 04:52.102
But there are still
things I can make you do.

04:52.153 --> 04:54.321
All right, you can watch me
shower, but no touching.

04:54.355 --> 04:55.939
No touching just
makes it hotter.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.574
No, I'm after
bigger game than you.

04:57.608 --> 04:59.559
See you're a very influential
man, Donaghy.

04:59.594 --> 05:03.230
You can pull strings in the kind
of venerable institutions

05:03.264 --> 05:05.298
that still reject
creeps like me.

05:05.333 --> 05:09.202
I want you to get my triplets
into preschool...

05:09.236 --> 05:10.871
At St. Matthew's.

05:10.905 --> 05:13.273
Banks, that's impossible.

05:13.307 --> 05:15.292
Just last year,
they rejected one of

05:15.343 --> 05:17.644
St. Matthew's
actual descendents.

05:17.678 --> 05:18.628
I know.

05:18.679 --> 05:19.880
I head that during her interview

05:19.914 --> 05:23.416
she turned the class
hamster into a dove.

05:23.434 --> 05:24.434
Good luck.

05:28.823 --> 05:29.856
Pick up the Mercury
with the tape,

05:29.891 --> 05:31.658
bag it, then seal the bags.

05:31.692 --> 05:33.360
We'll drive everything
out to the meadowlands

05:33.394 --> 05:34.594
and roll the car into a swamp.

05:34.629 --> 05:36.830
We should take two cars.

05:36.864 --> 05:38.431
You didn't tell me he was alive!

05:38.466 --> 05:39.599
Well of course he is.

05:39.634 --> 05:40.967
Pete's our friend, Kelsey.

05:41.002 --> 05:42.068
Damn it!

05:42.103 --> 05:43.169
No names!

05:43.204 --> 05:44.204
We don't want him to die.

05:44.238 --> 05:45.205
But more importantly,

05:45.239 --> 05:46.206
we don't want to be blamed for

05:46.240 --> 05:47.207
what's happened to him.

05:47.241 --> 05:48.208
It's been five hours since

05:48.242 --> 05:50.744
he's pressed an elevator button.

05:50.778 --> 05:52.495
His office is on
this floor, isn't it?

05:52.547 --> 05:55.482
Yes, but to get him there, you
have to go through the backstage

05:55.516 --> 05:57.317
and the backstage
is full of people.

05:57.351 --> 05:58.985
We need a distraction.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.005
Something to clear
the halls of TGS.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.296
How much time will
Kenneth and I have?

06:10.314 --> 06:11.398
How long is the show?

06:11.432 --> 06:12.933
I don't know.

06:12.967 --> 06:18.271
I've never done it before, baby.

06:18.306 --> 06:19.439
I will make
a brief statement

06:19.473 --> 06:21.975
on behalf of
the idiot community,

06:22.009 --> 06:23.810
then I will open
the floor for questions.

06:23.828 --> 06:26.196
Since its founding
early this afternoon,

06:26.247 --> 06:30.083
the national association for
zero intolerance, or Nazi...

06:30.117 --> 06:31.985
- We should change that.
- It's fine.

06:32.019 --> 06:35.589
We are outraged that the
American bigot, Liz Lemon,

06:35.623 --> 06:37.591
has made no effort
to reach out to us.

06:37.625 --> 06:38.825
Tracy, are you kidding me?

06:38.843 --> 06:41.160
I have been calling
your cell all day.

06:41.178 --> 06:42.545
My ringtone is
the chicken dance.

06:42.597 --> 06:44.547
If I answer it,
I won't hear the whole song!

06:44.599 --> 06:45.932
I have to go talk
to Jack right now.

06:45.967 --> 06:49.636
Wait for me in my office.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.671
Is there anything
you would like to add?

06:53.107 --> 06:56.109
These microphones look like
black ice cream cones.

06:58.145 --> 07:00.447
Thank you all for coming out.

07:00.481 --> 07:04.034
Jack, I am giving you your
money back.

07:04.068 --> 07:06.519
You can't tear up
my checks, Criss.

07:06.554 --> 07:09.039
They're printed on
Nixon's old bed sheets.

07:09.073 --> 07:11.691
Look, I don't understand
your relationship with Liz.

07:11.726 --> 07:13.126
She's my subordifriend.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.494
Well, she's my girlfriend
and I'm not

07:14.528 --> 07:15.695
gonna let you
get in between us.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.831
It's a little late for that.

07:17.865 --> 07:20.033
You're not going to want to hear
this, but I am

07:20.067 --> 07:21.635
officially disapproving of you.

07:21.669 --> 07:23.803
Well, I'm sorry, but I really
don't care what you think.

07:23.838 --> 07:26.373
That's really not how things
work around here, Criss.

07:26.407 --> 07:28.475
Damn it, Criss, stop talking
to him, it's a trap!

07:28.509 --> 07:29.476
You said I won.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.477
You said you wouldn't ask any

07:30.511 --> 07:31.878
more questions about Criss.

07:31.896 --> 07:33.713
I said I wouldn't ask
you any more questions.

07:33.748 --> 07:35.265
Semantics!

07:35.316 --> 07:36.549
You had no right
to come to my home

07:36.584 --> 07:39.319
to trick Criss to
rearrange my bathroom.

07:39.353 --> 07:40.487
- For the better.
- Yes.

07:40.521 --> 07:42.155
The basket of shells
was a nice touch.

07:42.189 --> 07:43.406
But, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

07:43.441 --> 07:46.943
I just told Criss that I am
officially disapproving.

07:46.994 --> 07:48.662
- Oh, no.
- Who cares?

07:48.696 --> 07:50.263
Of course, you're free to make
your own decisions, Lemon.

07:50.297 --> 07:53.033
You can either pretend that you
and I are not in agreement

07:53.067 --> 07:54.367
and continue this, uh...

07:54.402 --> 07:55.835
charade.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.470
Or you can part ways
with Criss now

07:57.505 --> 08:00.373
and go and find someone who will
truly make you happy.

08:00.407 --> 08:01.775
I'm sorry, is this guy
breaking up with me?

08:01.809 --> 08:03.460
Of course, you and Criss
can still be friends.

08:03.511 --> 08:06.262
Okay, Liz, I guess you
got a choice to make.

08:06.297 --> 08:08.598
You can listen to Jack,
we can call it quits

08:08.632 --> 08:09.849
and I go back to
sleeping on the floor

08:09.884 --> 08:11.351
of my Uncle's
mattress store, or...

08:11.385 --> 08:12.352
You don't understand.

08:12.386 --> 08:13.853
He's in my head.

08:13.888 --> 08:14.854
Okay, forget Jack.

08:14.889 --> 08:16.589
What does Liz think, hmm?

08:16.624 --> 08:17.757
What do you want?

08:17.775 --> 08:19.776
Do you want to be
with me or not?

08:20.811 --> 08:22.629
Don't look at me, ask her.

08:22.663 --> 08:23.997
I don't know, Liz.

08:24.031 --> 08:25.949
It's gonna go wrong
eventually, right?

08:25.983 --> 08:28.318
I mean, I like him, but,
what are we doing here?

08:28.369 --> 08:29.636
Really?

08:29.670 --> 08:32.539
This is how you see yourself?

08:32.573 --> 08:34.941
Of course I pick you, Criss.

08:34.958 --> 08:37.744
If you would just address
some of the issues

08:37.778 --> 08:40.212
that we as a group have
been talking about.

08:40.246 --> 08:42.248
Unbelievable.

08:44.451 --> 08:46.986
Well, I have to go get a bunch
of gaybies into preschool

08:47.021 --> 08:50.006
before we all get sued,
so, uh...

08:51.759 --> 08:54.260
Well done, Lemon.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.325
So, then he says
"Tiff down there"...

09:02.364 --> 09:03.915
Good one, Jack.

09:03.966 --> 09:04.916
I'll tell you,
friendship is the

09:04.967 --> 09:06.551
one kind of ship
that never sinks.

09:06.585 --> 09:08.236
Douglas, so good to see you.

09:08.270 --> 09:11.205
Uh, do you know
my friend, Devin Banks?

09:11.240 --> 09:12.206
A friend of Donaghy's, eh?

09:12.241 --> 09:13.641
I'll watch my wallet.

09:13.675 --> 09:16.093
Yes, yes, very good, Douglas.

09:16.144 --> 09:17.111
Very funny.

09:17.145 --> 09:18.512
So now we're all good friends

09:18.547 --> 09:20.114
and good friends do
favors for each other.

09:20.148 --> 09:21.682
Is that a St. Matthew's tie?

09:21.717 --> 09:22.733
I didn't know you went there.

09:22.768 --> 09:23.935
Not only did I go there,

09:23.986 --> 09:25.736
I happen to be President
of the board.

09:25.771 --> 09:27.321
Although, during
my financial report

09:27.356 --> 09:29.423
I may be President of the bored.

09:33.328 --> 09:35.079
St. Matthew's is such a
wonderful school.

09:35.113 --> 09:36.330
We were just talking about that.

09:36.365 --> 09:38.399
In fact, Devin's triplets are

09:38.417 --> 09:40.801
applying to St. Matthew's
right now.

09:40.836 --> 09:42.970
I see...

09:43.005 --> 09:44.805
Splendid.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.566
On a totally unrelated topic,

09:46.567 --> 09:50.531
did you know that I'm also on the
board of the Manhattan hospital

09:50.532 --> 09:52.813
for rich whites and
assimilated Jews?

09:52.848 --> 09:53.814
I did not know that.

09:53.849 --> 09:55.317
Unfortunately,

09:55.318 --> 09:57.232
shortly before Don Geiss died,

09:57.233 --> 10:01.188
the Geiss foundation made a
sizeable pledge to the hospital.

10:01.223 --> 10:04.558
A pledge which, sadly,
has not been fulfilled.

10:04.593 --> 10:05.653
What a coincidence

10:05.654 --> 10:08.629
because Devin and I happen
to know the new chair

10:08.630 --> 10:10.815
of the Geiss
foundation quite well.

10:10.866 --> 10:12.600
That is a coincidence.

10:19.841 --> 10:21.842
Kathy, are you
ready to come out now?

10:25.631 --> 10:27.281
There she is.

10:27.316 --> 10:28.649
Hey, you.

10:28.684 --> 10:30.217
Hey, funny.

10:30.252 --> 10:32.453
Kathy, I know this
is a lot to take in but,

10:32.487 --> 10:35.256
your father made a promise
to my friend, so,

10:35.290 --> 10:38.626
what can we do to get
that check right now?

10:38.660 --> 10:43.364
And that's why I'm so thrilled
to introduce NBC's new mascot,

10:43.398 --> 10:45.016
Magellica the Unicorn.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.317
It's wondrous.

10:46.351 --> 10:47.351
Indeed.

10:47.402 --> 10:48.836
Back to you, Thomas.

10:48.870 --> 10:51.305
Okay...we now return
to our coverage

10:51.340 --> 10:53.541
of that train derailment
in California.

10:53.575 --> 10:56.344
And idiots can do anything
we put our minds to.

10:56.378 --> 10:58.713
I played
a "nucular" psychiatrist

10:58.747 --> 11:00.848
in a James "Bong" movie.

11:00.882 --> 11:03.317
Look, what do I need to do to
make this go away?

11:03.352 --> 11:04.318
I want you to call my phone so

11:04.353 --> 11:05.786
I can hear
the chicken dance again.

11:05.821 --> 11:07.488
And I want the video
for my new single

11:07.522 --> 11:09.156
to play on TGS this week.

11:09.191 --> 11:10.458
<i> La piscine</i>

11:10.492 --> 11:12.259
<i> j'adore la piscine</i>

11:12.294 --> 11:14.378
<i> towels sunscreen
bathing suits </i>

11:14.429 --> 11:16.130
<i> diving boards and towels</i>

11:16.164 --> 11:17.548
<i> those ladders</i>

11:17.599 --> 11:18.566
<i> towels</i>

11:18.600 --> 11:19.767
Can you make it
16 minutes long?

11:19.801 --> 11:20.835
We're short this week.

11:20.869 --> 11:22.403
I'll try to cut it down.

11:22.437 --> 11:24.055
But above all, we want you to

11:24.106 --> 11:26.407
recognize who we are
as a community.

11:26.441 --> 11:29.877
Idiots aren't just strippers or
stay at home moms.

11:29.911 --> 11:31.862
Idiots are all around us.

11:31.897 --> 11:33.981
I couldn't find a Lincoln hat

11:34.015 --> 11:35.983
so I grabbed this
chimney sweep hat instead.

11:36.017 --> 11:37.017
If anyone notices...

11:38.620 --> 11:39.570
We're dead.

11:39.621 --> 11:40.955
So it would mean a lot if you

11:40.989 --> 11:42.890
apologized publically,
Liz Lemon.

11:42.924 --> 11:44.825
Let the healing begin.

11:44.860 --> 11:47.094
And since
you wrote my apology,

11:47.129 --> 11:49.363
we went on ahead
and wrote yours.

11:50.732 --> 11:52.733
Careful.

11:53.835 --> 11:54.835
Careful.

11:56.438 --> 11:57.471
Who designed your bathroom?

11:57.506 --> 11:58.639
It's exquisite.

11:58.673 --> 11:59.874
I did, you son of a bitch.

11:59.908 --> 12:01.892
I'm excellent at
rearranging bathrooms.

12:01.927 --> 12:03.544
Now get out of here,
you got what you wanted.

12:03.562 --> 12:05.596
I just wanted to
say thank you, Jack.

12:05.647 --> 12:06.597
Very impressive.

12:06.648 --> 12:07.598
Can't imagine that your boss,

12:07.649 --> 12:08.733
Hank Cooper, was all that happy

12:08.767 --> 12:10.451
about the logo change.

12:10.485 --> 12:12.052
Eh, we'll see.

12:12.087 --> 12:12.994
Our new slogan,

12:12.995 --> 12:14.989
"NBC, we have a magical horse?"

12:15.023 --> 12:18.225
Is testing, uh...Okay.

12:18.243 --> 12:21.061
Oh, I also wanted to
say that I was lying

12:21.096 --> 12:22.763
when I said that this
wasn't a business play.

12:22.798 --> 12:24.231
Banks, you're out of the game.

12:24.266 --> 12:25.232
That's true.

12:25.267 --> 12:26.734
And I've admitted defeat.

12:26.768 --> 12:28.102
For our generation.

12:28.136 --> 12:29.770
But for the next generation?

12:29.805 --> 12:32.807
Well, thanks to you,
the Banks boys are way ahead.

12:32.841 --> 12:34.208
All the favors
that you called in,

12:34.242 --> 12:36.243
you would have used next year
for little lippy.

12:36.278 --> 12:37.411
Liddy.

12:37.429 --> 12:38.646
Is that even a name?

12:38.680 --> 12:40.314
In Brooklyn, I know,
like, six lippys...

12:40.348 --> 12:42.383
Doesn't matter.

12:42.417 --> 12:44.452
You just mortgaged
your daughter's future

12:44.486 --> 12:46.103
to get out of
a little jam at work.

12:46.138 --> 12:49.790
My mommy and me group would
really judge your parenting.

12:49.825 --> 12:51.892
Especially lippy's mother.

12:51.927 --> 12:52.927
Which lippy?

12:52.961 --> 12:54.228
Lippy D.

12:54.262 --> 12:57.164
Oh, God, Liddy might have to
go to public school.

12:57.199 --> 12:58.566
See you in 30 years, Jack.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.268
I wonder what Liddy will be
doing with her degree from suny.

13:01.286 --> 13:02.269
Don't even say it.

13:02.287 --> 13:03.304
Oneonta.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.841
You, jacket.

13:13.921 --> 13:18.156
Well, hello there,
welcome to the White House.

13:20.268 --> 13:21.735
Four score and
seven years ago...

13:21.769 --> 13:23.503
What's with that hat?

13:23.538 --> 13:25.739
Oh, I think
it looks very authentic.

13:27.525 --> 13:29.543
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:35.350 --> 13:37.351
Mary Todd, you say?

13:41.039 --> 13:42.072
Wha... what's happening?

13:42.123 --> 13:44.157
Shh, Pete, don't talk.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.827
Wassup?!

13:46.861 --> 13:48.528
Yeah, baby!

13:48.546 --> 13:52.165
I'm here today to apologize for
my earlier comments.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.769
I used an offensive term to
describe a group of people

13:55.803 --> 13:59.006
who made America the great...

13:59.040 --> 14:01.375
continent that it is today.

14:01.409 --> 14:02.376
Yeah!

14:02.410 --> 14:03.543
These kickass people have

14:03.578 --> 14:06.430
given the world countless
bodacious things

14:06.481 --> 14:10.400
like the birther movement,
intelligent design...

14:11.719 --> 14:14.154
Water parks... no, I will not
endorse water parks.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.189
They are a cesspool of
disease and people boo you

14:16.224 --> 14:18.158
when you walk back
down the stairs.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.861
You know what you people
have given the world?

14:20.895 --> 14:23.563
<i>Girls gone wild.</i>

14:23.581 --> 14:27.834
The Golden Globes, cans that
tell you how cold beer is,

14:27.869 --> 14:30.570
Florida, bratz dolls.

14:30.605 --> 14:31.571
Oh, I get it.

14:31.606 --> 14:32.839
She's naming awesome things.

14:32.874 --> 14:34.241
No, listen to me.

14:34.275 --> 14:38.211
Because of you, there may be
an <i>entourage</i> movie.

14:38.246 --> 14:40.013
Hug it off, ma'am!

14:40.048 --> 14:42.349
Turtle, turtle, turtle!

14:42.383 --> 14:43.800
You know what, I give up.

14:43.851 --> 14:45.852
You should know better, but no.

14:45.887 --> 14:48.755
You're just gonna keep
on riding motorcycles,

14:48.773 --> 14:50.345
having unprotected sex

14:50.346 --> 14:53.060
and voting against
free health care.

14:53.094 --> 14:56.329
You will make the same
self-destructive decisions

14:56.364 --> 14:59.232
over and over and you will
never really be happy.

14:59.267 --> 15:02.069
And your jaw will
hurt all the time.

15:02.103 --> 15:03.453
Oh, look at you.

15:03.488 --> 15:05.105
Perfect little weiner dog,

15:05.139 --> 15:07.324
you just need a little
mustard on you like that.

15:07.375 --> 15:10.744
And a little bun,
just boop, like that.

15:10.778 --> 15:15.115
No one will make you
deutschepancakes,

15:15.149 --> 15:18.985
or welcome you home smelling of
hot dog water and onion,

15:19.020 --> 15:23.790
or let you break out of jail
when you play monopoly.

15:23.825 --> 15:26.226
Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

15:32.934 --> 15:33.900
Wanna make out?

15:33.935 --> 15:34.935
No, thank you.

15:40.408 --> 15:42.692
Hot crowd, hot crowd.

15:42.744 --> 15:44.477
We've only got a minute before I
have to get back out there.

15:44.495 --> 15:47.280
Act two is a play within a play.

15:47.315 --> 15:49.533
It's funny, in school all you
learn about Abraham Lincoln

15:49.584 --> 15:50.917
is that he was a gay alcoholic.

15:50.952 --> 15:54.988
Grab his feet.

15:55.006 --> 15:56.790
Kelsey Gram...

15:56.824 --> 15:58.425
Shh, shh, shh.

15:58.459 --> 16:00.427
There, there, there you go.

16:00.461 --> 16:02.462
Okay, okay.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.858
I've gotta get back
into character.

16:14.892 --> 16:15.909
Hit me in the face!

16:20.898 --> 16:23.483
What... I forgot to
press a floor again.

16:23.518 --> 16:26.286
Hey, what's up, Jackie d?

16:26.320 --> 16:29.589
In a lot of ways, you and I
had similar upbringings.

16:29.624 --> 16:31.191
Terrible schools,
broken homes...

16:31.225 --> 16:32.993
Thinking basketball was the
ticket out.

16:33.027 --> 16:33.994
Being wrong.

16:34.028 --> 16:35.762
At some point,
our paths diverged.

16:35.797 --> 16:38.832
I went on to Princeton, business
school, ge and beyond.

16:38.866 --> 16:40.200
And look at me.

16:40.234 --> 16:42.368
I spent all day
creating a movement

16:42.386 --> 16:44.738
just to get back at Liz Lemon.

16:45.907 --> 16:47.808
I said creating a movement.

16:47.842 --> 16:50.811
The point is that excellence
can come from anywhere.

16:50.845 --> 16:52.179
It's the same with stupidity.

16:52.213 --> 16:55.415
In this country, anyone could be
the next Jack Donaghy

16:55.449 --> 16:57.450
or the next Denise Richards.

16:59.103 --> 17:01.421
This room...

17:01.455 --> 17:03.356
Is moving.

17:03.391 --> 17:04.391
Oh, God.

17:13.416 --> 17:14.501
Banks.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.602
What are you still doing here?

17:15.636 --> 17:17.270
Well, my husband was supposed

17:17.305 --> 17:19.739
to pick me up at 6:00 but
he can be such an idiot.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.407
I'm sure he can.

17:21.442 --> 17:24.377
Where did you go
to school, Devin?

17:24.412 --> 17:27.430
I had the best education
in the world.

17:27.464 --> 17:30.917
Private kindergarten where I got
straight check marks.

17:30.952 --> 17:32.886
Experimental boarding school
in carmel

17:32.920 --> 17:34.855
where the students
teach the teachers,

17:34.889 --> 17:36.990
and the teachers teach animals.

17:37.024 --> 17:39.092
Year abroad on an
all-male catamaran.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.795
Then on to Northwestern where
I majored in confidence.

17:41.829 --> 17:44.130
I had every educational
advantage, Jack.

17:44.165 --> 17:46.933
Just like my children will.

17:46.951 --> 17:49.436
But I beat you.

17:49.470 --> 17:50.437
What?

17:50.471 --> 17:51.438
I beat you.

17:51.472 --> 17:52.973
I came from nothing.

17:53.007 --> 17:55.075
But I caught up
and I crushed you.

17:55.109 --> 17:56.877
Just like Liddy's
gonna crush your sons.

17:56.911 --> 17:59.613
She's already sorting objects by
shape and color.

17:59.647 --> 18:01.114
At 11 months,
I don't think so.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.983
She can count to ten if
you say seven for her.

18:03.017 --> 18:04.117
She gets five and nine?

18:04.151 --> 18:05.418
- She can save five words.
- So.

18:05.453 --> 18:06.786
In mandarin.

18:06.821 --> 18:08.255
They've put her with
the toddlers at her

18:08.289 --> 18:10.056
singing and clapping
class at fun factory.

18:10.091 --> 18:11.458
She's in Orange group?

18:11.492 --> 18:13.326
She's already out of the
piaget sensorimotor stage.

18:13.361 --> 18:14.661
That's impossible.

18:14.695 --> 18:17.831
She scored a 62 on the object
permanence matrix.

18:17.865 --> 18:19.799
But that's an adult score.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.301
And did I mention...

18:21.335 --> 18:22.903
She's using the potty.

18:22.937 --> 18:24.237
Surely just for wee-wee.

18:24.272 --> 18:25.272
No.

18:25.306 --> 18:27.307
See you in 30 years, Banks.

18:29.377 --> 18:30.577
It's already, like,
turning itself.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.828
But I feel like I still
have to turn it.

18:33.147 --> 18:37.033
Oh, oh, my God, mustard just
came out my nose.

18:37.084 --> 18:41.454
Oh, it's burning
the backs of my eyes.

18:41.489 --> 18:42.622
All right, I gotta go
back to work, bye.

18:42.656 --> 18:44.324
Okay, all right.

18:44.358 --> 18:46.492
Ah, it's burning my face now.

18:51.349 --> 18:55.135
All right, I'm putting you on
probationary approval.

18:55.169 --> 18:56.636
Okay, I don't really care.

18:56.670 --> 18:57.938
I'll tell you what
changed my mind, Criss:

18:57.972 --> 18:59.773
a conversation I had
with Tracy Jordan.

18:59.807 --> 19:02.776
You see, greatness can
come from anywhere.

19:02.810 --> 19:06.212
So if a poor boy from
Boston can become me,

19:06.247 --> 19:07.280
maybe you could become

19:07.315 --> 19:09.783
a suitable sex partner
for Liz Lemon.

19:09.817 --> 19:12.685
You've got three months.

19:12.703 --> 19:14.321
But your opinion
doesn't matter.

19:14.355 --> 19:16.356
You have no say in this.

19:24.298 --> 19:27.300
Liz, there's something
wrong with Pete.

19:29.003 --> 19:30.503
Oh, my God!

19:30.538 --> 19:31.705
I don't know what happened.

19:31.739 --> 19:32.872
Pete, I have been
out there putting

19:32.890 --> 19:34.090
out fires all day
while you've been

19:34.141 --> 19:35.675
hiding in here doing this?

19:35.710 --> 19:37.844
You're disgusting.

19:37.878 --> 19:41.281
No, no, I was... I didn't... I...

19:41.315 --> 19:42.715
Kelsey Grammer!

19:42.733 --> 19:44.651
Kelsey Grammer did this to me.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.852
Really, Pete?

19:45.886 --> 19:47.821
Kelsey Grammer made you do this

19:47.855 --> 19:53.026
while he was performing his one
man show about Abraham Lincoln?

19:53.060 --> 19:54.728
Ugh.

19:54.762 --> 19:57.263
Here's to another successful
operation by...

19:57.298 --> 19:58.832
The best friends gang.

20:00.001 --> 20:00.967
Hang on.

20:01.002 --> 20:02.035
I didn't notice before with all

20:02.069 --> 20:03.837
the excitement, but...

20:03.871 --> 20:05.872
I look incredibly beautiful.

20:05.906 --> 20:08.174
The lighting is back to normal.

20:08.209 --> 20:10.343
Both switches need
to be on, woman.

20:10.378 --> 20:12.078
The bulb wasn't even broken?

20:12.096 --> 20:14.014
None of this was necessary.

20:22.374 --> 20:25.874
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

20:32.131 --> 20:33.531
I know...

20:34.098 --> 20:36.718
I've been successfully
assassinated.

20:36.949 --> 20:40.149
But I have one last thing
to tell my country.

20:40.593 --> 20:44.093
Blackbeard's gold
is buried in...

20:52.773 --> 20:54.293
I am a ghost now,

20:54.389 --> 20:57.089
Leaving behind my
earthly possessions.

20:57.733 --> 21:01.833
And although I left my
country divided by war,

21:01.928 --> 21:04.728
A civil war...

21:05.140 --> 21:07.560
So that's where
that name came from.

21:07.568 --> 21:11.088
I know that future generations
will forge a stronger country

21:11.398 --> 21:14.418
And that some day,
America will be a place

21:15.262 --> 21:18.682
Where everybody
knows your name.
