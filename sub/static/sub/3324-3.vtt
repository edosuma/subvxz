00:02.003 --> 00:03.163
Previously on "Teen Wolf":

00:03.337 --> 00:05.623
- They're not gonna split us apart.
- Not us.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.747
- There's another.
- Please don't tell them.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.085
They called it a fugue state.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.717
I can't remember running through
the woods naked for two days.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.924
- How did you do that?
- I'm the Alpha.

00:18.102 --> 00:20.093
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

02:07.628 --> 02:12.292
Ever wonder what happens if
a hunter gets bitten, Allison?

02:14.218 --> 02:18.461
Ever wonder what happens
it you get bitten?

02:20.349 --> 02:23.307
What do you think
your father would do?

02:25.313 --> 02:28.555
What do you think
he'd have to do?

02:42.913 --> 02:48.453
When all it would take to
change everything is one bite.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.332
One bite...

02:56.594 --> 02:58.050
And everything changes.

03:03.643 --> 03:06.305
Is this how we're gonna do
father/daughter talks from now on?

03:07.146 --> 03:10.138
No, this is how
we're gonna train you.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.730
Do you know why we use arrows?

03:16.447 --> 03:18.938
They can't heal
until it's taken out.

03:20.451 --> 03:21.736
Look familiar?

03:22.411 --> 03:24.447
- You were going to kill him.
- That's right.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.955
And if we find Isaac on
another full moon, we will kill him.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.533
That's the hard choice we make.

03:31.504 --> 03:33.119
But it wasn't my choice.

03:34.674 --> 03:35.880
Gerard?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.799
No.

03:43.849 --> 03:50.391
You see, our family has a
surprisingly progressive tradition.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.767
Knowing wars and violence are
typically started by men,

03:57.321 --> 04:01.655
we place the final decisions,
the hard ones...

04:03.452 --> 04:04.953
with the women.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.994
Our sons are trained
to be soldiers.

04:12.962 --> 04:16.045
Our daughters, to be leaders.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.595
Training starts now.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.848
Time her.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.910
Congrats.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.416
For what? It took me
two and half hours.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.502
Took me three when I did it.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.254
It had a tail.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.632
I don't have a tail.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.927
Maybe you just haven't grown it yet.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.637
I'm not growing a tail.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.093
Ever.

06:36.981 --> 06:39.939
- Are you slowing down for me?
- I was waiting for you.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.776
- What? Waiting for me to catch up?
- You looked like you were struggling.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.987
Maybe I was admiring the view.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.110
Try admiring from afar.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.556
McCall, I don't know why, but your pain
gives me a special kind of joy.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.262
Right?

07:19.982 --> 07:21.597
All right, next two!

07:22.484 --> 07:24.941
Stilinski, Erica, let's go.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.519
The wall.

07:51.347 --> 07:52.962
Oh, please...

07:54.391 --> 07:55.346
Erica!

07:56.226 --> 07:57.602
Dizzy?

07:57.770 --> 07:59.260
Is it vertigo?

07:59.980 --> 08:03.063
Vertigo's a dysfunction of the
vestibular system of the inner ear.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.814
She's just freaking out.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.191
Erica!

08:09.114 --> 08:10.445
I'm fine.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.108
Coach, maybe it's not safe.
You know she's epileptic.

08:14.954 --> 08:17.320
Why doesn't anybody
tell me this stuff?

08:17.498 --> 08:20.160
Erica, you're fine. Just...

08:20.751 --> 08:22.833
Just kick off from the wall.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.665
There's a mat to catch you.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.421
Come on.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.715
See, you're fine.
You're on the ground.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.509
You're all right. Let's go.
Shake it off. You're fine.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.185
Oh God...

09:05.587 --> 09:06.713
Listen up.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.789
Anybody sees Isaac Lahey,
you immediately tell the principal.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.583
Get a teacher, or you call me.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.752
Except for you, Greenberg.
Don't call me for anything.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.422
I'm not kidding. Don't call me.
You shouldn't even have my number.

09:18.934 --> 09:19.969
Baac?

09:20.936 --> 09:22.722
It's Derek's problem now.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.623
What do you mean
tonight's not a good idea?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.044
I don't know.

09:46.211 --> 09:51.046
That thing that we saw last night,
Isaac missing, Allison's grandfather.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.625
All this stuff happening with Derek
just doesn't feel right.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.465
No, you're not backing out.
Do you wanna know why?

09:57.639 --> 09:59.891
Because you and Allison are obviously
having quite a good time together.

10:00.059 --> 10:02.266
And you know who else wants
to have a good time? Stiles!

10:02.436 --> 10:04.802
Stiles wants to have a good
time... Many, many times.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.972
Several times in a row.
In several different positions.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.890
Are you even listening to me?

10:10.652 --> 10:12.392
What... what is that?

10:23.332 --> 10:25.163
Put her on her side.

10:26.502 --> 10:29.369
- How'd you know?
- ljust felt it.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.719
It's been a while
since we saw you, Erica.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.427
You were being so good about
taking your medication.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.679
Are you gonna tell my mom?

10:44.853 --> 10:48.812
Well, I swear I don't want to, but
there's this team of lawyers in the back

10:48.982 --> 10:51.314
who would break my legs,
and I don't know if you've seen my legs,

10:51.485 --> 10:55.069
but for a girl my age,
they're still pretty hot. So...

10:57.950 --> 10:59.781
Doctor's gonna be in
in a minute, okay?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.244
Okay.

11:32.151 --> 11:33.266
Lie still.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.836
Side effects may include anxiety,

11:58.552 --> 12:00.964
weight gain, acne,

12:01.180 --> 12:03.592
ulcerative colitis.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.049
Who are you?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.647
Let's just say we
have a mutual friend.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.066
You get a...

12:21.992 --> 12:24.984
warning right before
you have a seizure.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.320
It's called an aura.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.493
It's...

12:31.376 --> 12:33.958
It's like a
metallic taste in my mouth.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.291
You don't have to lie, Erica.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.629
What's it really taste like?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.677
It tastes like blood.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.055
What if I told you...

12:50.270 --> 12:52.932
that all of this could go away?

12:55.484 --> 12:57.065
The side effects...

12:59.488 --> 13:01.228
the symptoms...

13:04.493 --> 13:05.778
All of it.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.579
And what if all those things...

13:11.959 --> 13:14.166
not only went away...

13:16.630 --> 13:18.495
but everything else...

13:21.927 --> 13:23.542
got even better?

13:27.808 --> 13:28.888
How?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.139
Let me show you.

13:42.281 --> 13:45.865
A small exposure to
an otherwise deadly virus

13:46.034 --> 13:49.743
can actually prevent the effects
of the infection from spreading.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.121
This is called vaccination.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.870
Dude, what the hell
did you do to my camera?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.453
The lens is cracked.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.002
- So by creating an immunity...
- Did you drop it?

14:03.218 --> 14:05.800
your body is primed
to fight off the infection.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.878
Do you know how
expensive this thing is?

14:08.432 --> 14:12.050
For meningitis to rabies
from an animal bite.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.009
- Jackson.
- Just send me a bill.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.769
Meaning the subject
is now immune.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.605
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What?

14:26.825 --> 14:28.907
Show it to me.
Show it to me. Come on.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.405
- Are you out of your mind?
- Nothing happened to you.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.990
It's like...

14:33.498 --> 14:35.079
It's like you're immune.

14:35.334 --> 14:37.541
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

14:37.753 --> 14:38.868
Listen!

14:39.087 --> 14:40.497
It's you.

14:41.381 --> 14:45.090
Whatever it is... blood, saliva...

14:45.302 --> 14:49.420
Whatever soul-killing substance is running
through your veins, you did this to me.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.677
You ruined it for me.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.555
You ruined everything!

15:26.468 --> 15:27.423
Hello?

15:33.725 --> 15:35.226
This is the girls' room.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.364
Boyd.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.327
You got the keys?

16:49.551 --> 16:52.167
This isn't a favor.
It's a transaction.

16:52.554 --> 16:53.919
Right, yeah.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.800
Absolutely.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.307
I said 50.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.687
Really, I... I remember 20.
I don't know.

17:07.903 --> 17:10.394
l have a really good verbal memory.
And I remember 20.

17:10.572 --> 17:13.405
I remember that distinctive
"twa" sound, "twa-enty."

17:13.575 --> 17:16.783
I said fifty. With a "fa" sound.
Hear the difference?

17:17.245 --> 17:20.282
If you can't, I can demonstrate some
other words with the "fa" sound.

17:20.499 --> 17:23.491
Oh, no, no, no.
I think I'm recalling it now.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.535
Maybe I just got it confused with...

17:27.339 --> 17:29.375
"for-ty."

17:38.767 --> 17:41.383
Come on, man, have you seen the
piece of crap jeep that I drive?

17:41.603 --> 17:44.515
You seen the piece of crap
bus that I take?

17:49.402 --> 17:50.482
Fiddy.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.907
Okay. Thank you.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.696
Got 'em.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.532
Pick you up right after work tonight
and we'll meet at the rink, cool?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.366
What...

18:40.537 --> 18:42.778
the holy hell is that?

18:44.708 --> 18:45.914
It's Erica.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.078
Why do | get the feeling
you've got a lot on your mind?

19:33.298 --> 19:37.041
Sorry, itjust, kind of
slipped through my fingers.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.002
Everything has been slipping
through my fingers.

19:40.221 --> 19:44.510
Now that sounds like for too world-weary
a thing for a teenager to say.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.425
Sorry.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.812
You might wanna try a
different perspective.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.857
This is just entropy at work.

19:55.111 --> 19:58.478
This is more the natural
way of the universe.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.111
But it doesn't necessarily
mean it's falling apart.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.069
It's just...

20:06.956 --> 20:08.366
changing shape.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.081
For better or worse?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.379
Exactly.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.755
Hey, doc.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.221
When are we gonna talk about...

20:24.057 --> 20:26.890
The thing that we never got
a chance to talk about?

20:27.102 --> 20:28.433
Oh, yes.

20:29.938 --> 20:33.021
We never did get a chance
to talk about that, did we?

20:34.067 --> 20:36.274
Now is definitely a good time.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.896
Thank God.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.066
What do you think?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.116
Two dollars?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.278
- Two dollars?
- You're right.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.488
$2.50 more an hour.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.991
It seems like a pretty good raise.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.869
It's not exactly what I was...

20:52.711 --> 20:54.292
$2.50 more an hour?

20:54.504 --> 20:55.710
Done.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.005
Don't forget to clean up
the cat cages.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.144
- Headed out?
- Studying.

21:20.405 --> 21:23.147
- Just studying, dad.
- | get it.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.532
But we need you to
remember what happened.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.861
You want me to stop
being friends with her?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.364
Actually, we want the opposite.

21:32.584 --> 21:37.044
I know how this might sound,
but we need you to keep an eye on her.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.496
You want me to spy on her?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.915
We want you to look out
for your friend

21:42.135 --> 21:44.467
to make sure
everything's okay with her.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.224
Seems okay to me.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.210
Could it be any colder in here?

22:19.964 --> 22:21.124
Here.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.835
I'm wearing blue.

22:24.886 --> 22:27.093
Orange and blue,
not a good combination.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.636
But it's the colors of the mets.

22:31.601 --> 22:32.556
Okay.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.153
Okay, um, maybe
orange and blue is not the best.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.288
But, you know, um,

22:56.459 --> 22:59.166
sometimes there's other things you
wouldn't think would be a good combination

22:59.379 --> 23:02.462
end up turning out to be, like,
a perfect combination, you know,

23:02.632 --> 23:04.998
like two people together...

23:06.094 --> 23:09.427
who nobody ever thought
would be together...

23:09.597 --> 23:11.553
- ever.
- No, I can see that.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.265
You can?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.017
Yeah.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.558
They're cute together.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.027
Oh, yeah, them.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.821
- Cute.
- Cute.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.153
Adorable.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.826
Since you never skated before,
maybe I should give you a few pointers?

23:37.625 --> 23:40.788
Allison. Not that this
is news to you or anything,

23:41.004 --> 23:43.495
but you remember the werewolf thing?

23:43.715 --> 23:46.502
Super speed, strength
and reflexes.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.425
So a little ice skating
should be no problem.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.836
Yeah.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.431
See? It's no problem...

24:01.649 --> 24:02.604
Maybe.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.670
Well?

24:25.882 --> 24:26.917
Come on.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.879
Okay, you got it.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.086
You got it. You got...

24:40.521 --> 24:42.261
I think I'm getting
the hang of it!

24:46.194 --> 24:48.355
You look like you hit
your head that time.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.030
What's that, coach?

24:50.281 --> 24:52.397
You definitely hit your head.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.019
Oh, my eyes.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.896
The flash triggers them.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.981
This one's normal.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.277
Oh, that's not what I meant.

25:37.453 --> 25:38.704
It's okay.

25:38.913 --> 25:39.993
Here.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.117
Thanks.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.897
Two's not enough for Derek.
I know he needs at least three.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.690
So who's next?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.817
Why does there have to be a next
when we've already got you?

26:56.991 --> 26:58.947
Who's next?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.912
You know, I never knew what
I looked like during a seizure

27:02.080 --> 27:04.412
until someone took a video
of me once and put it online.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.411
- I don't care.
- It happened during class.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.118
I started seizing on my desk and
everyone was saying how they should

27:10.296 --> 27:13.834
put something in my mouth
until some genius reads the card

27:14.008 --> 27:16.875
on my key ring which tells him not to
'cause it could break my teeth.

27:17.053 --> 27:20.295
- Erica.
- Do you know what happens next?

27:22.475 --> 27:24.340
I piss myself.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.385
And they start laughing.

27:28.940 --> 27:33.400
You know, the only good thing about
seizures was that I never remembered them.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.110
Until some brilliant jerkoff...

27:37.448 --> 27:39.939
had to go and put cameras
in everybody's phone.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.077
Look at me now, Scott.

27:49.877 --> 27:50.992
That's right.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.832
You only have eyes for her.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.738
This is so embarrassing.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.364
Not at all.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.159
l have seen far worse
come through these doors.

29:07.330 --> 29:08.866
We keep a pair of
bolt cutters in the back.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.821
Trust me, you don't wanna
know what they're for.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.875
Let me guess. Something
about men and their egos.

29:14.045 --> 29:16.286
- Boys will be boys.
- Trust me, I know.

29:16.464 --> 29:19.251
l was a teacher for years at
an all boys private school.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.505
Oh, I don't need the anesthetic.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.419
Are you serious?

29:26.891 --> 29:28.051
Okay.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.842
Speaking of boys, how's Scott?

29:31.020 --> 29:32.726
Scott? He's, uh...

29:34.023 --> 29:35.888
like every other teenager.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.770
I'm sure he was pretty devastated
after the whole breakup.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.903
He has been a little odd lately.
Well, you know,

29:42.615 --> 29:47.325
he's kind of always odd,
but he doesn't seem all that...

29:48.204 --> 29:49.569
Heartbroken?

29:50.790 --> 29:52.121
Yeah.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.200
Maybe he just hides it well.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.878
Teenagers are quite good at
hiding things, aren't they?

29:59.799 --> 30:01.005
Indeed.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.510
I know how it looked,
but she came up to me.

30:12.353 --> 30:13.684
I'm not jealous.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.470
You're not?

30:16.691 --> 30:18.682
She's with Derek now, isn't she?

30:18.859 --> 30:20.190
Like Isaac.

30:23.531 --> 30:25.897
You can't get caught
in the middle of this.

30:26.617 --> 30:29.609
Don't you feel what's happening?
My grandfather coming here,

30:30.371 --> 30:32.612
Derek turning Erica and Isaac, it's...

30:33.708 --> 30:35.573
It's like battle lines are being drawn.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.003
- I know.
- There's always crossfire.

30:39.422 --> 30:40.958
What am I supposed to do?

30:41.966 --> 30:45.504
I can'tjust stand by.
I can't pretend to be normal.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.428
I don't want you to be normal.
I want you to be alive.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.015
Scott.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.347
Do you see that?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.229
What, it's an empty table.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.276
Yeah, but whose empty table?

31:06.282 --> 31:07.317
Boyd.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.203
I'll go to the ice rink,
see if he's there.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.080
And if he's not at home,
you call me, got it?

31:18.252 --> 31:20.709
- What?
- Maybe we should let him.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.370
Boyd, you know?

31:22.548 --> 31:24.664
You said Derek's giving
them a choice, right?

31:24.925 --> 31:26.426
We can't.

31:26.635 --> 31:29.468
You gotta admit,
Erica looks pretty good.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.799
You know, the word
"sensational" comes to mind.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.387
How good do you think she's gonna look
with a wolfsbane bullet in her head?

31:35.561 --> 31:39.429
All right, all I'm saying is maybe
this one isn't totally your responsibility.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.143
They are.

31:41.359 --> 31:45.068
And you know this thing's gonna get
out of control. That makes me responsible.

31:45.780 --> 31:47.395
All right, I'm with you.

31:47.615 --> 31:50.357
And I also gotta say this newfound heroism
is making me very attracted to you.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.149
- Shut up.
- No, seriously.

31:52.370 --> 31:55.407
Do you wanna just try making out for a sec?
Just to see how it feels.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.544
Derek.

32:06.300 --> 32:10.009
I know you can hear me.
You owe me an explanation.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.176
I wanna know why it...

32:15.393 --> 32:17.304
why it didn't work.

32:20.481 --> 32:21.687
Screw it.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.067
Holy...

32:28.572 --> 32:29.732
Wait.

32:40.668 --> 32:43.205
- What happened to him?
- That's a good question.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.711
I got one for you.
What are you doing here, Jackson?

32:48.759 --> 32:50.966
Nothing, I was...

32:51.137 --> 32:52.593
I was just... Nothing. I...

32:52.805 --> 32:58.220
Jackson, I hope you're not still
pursuing something that you shouldn't be.

32:58.436 --> 33:01.098
Because I don't want to
be forced to pursue you.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.603
Stay out of this.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.560
There's so much good in your life.

33:05.734 --> 33:10.444
You're smart, good-looking,
you're captain of the lacrosse team.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.989
Co-captain.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.164
Hey, Boyd?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.089
Hey, Boyd! It's Stiles.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.213
Oh... Wow!

33:39.768 --> 33:41.975
What are you doing here, Stiles?

33:43.022 --> 33:45.513
Nothing, I was just looking for, um...

33:46.233 --> 33:47.313
Boyd?

33:48.235 --> 33:50.191
Yeah. Yes. Boyd.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.938
You know what you're doing
right now it's kind of funny?

33:55.284 --> 33:58.117
You're only looking in my eyes.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.448
That's funny?

34:00.664 --> 34:01.744
Well, yeah.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.573
Because it's that kind of look
where you're trying not to look

34:04.752 --> 34:09.462
anywhere other than my eyes,
but you want to, don't you?

34:09.757 --> 34:13.500
You want a nice, long,

34:14.220 --> 34:16.757
hard look.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.216
Not really. No.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.851
Oh. So it's just my eyes?

34:25.064 --> 34:27.726
Yes. You have beautiful eyes.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.142
- l have beautiful everything.
- And a newfound self-confidence.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.437
Congratulations, Erica.
I should get going.

34:34.615 --> 34:37.152
- You're not going anywhere.
- Why not?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.408
You're having car trouble.

35:00.683 --> 35:03.049
I was wondering if you could
give me your medical opinion on

35:03.227 --> 35:04.808
what killed this man.

35:05.020 --> 35:08.763
I don't know if you saw the sign out there,
but this is just an animal clinic.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.647
I'm aware of that.

35:12.361 --> 35:16.024
I'm also aware you're not just a vet.

35:21.495 --> 35:22.450
Boyd!

35:24.707 --> 35:26.413
I just wanna talk.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.329
Hey, come on, Boyd, please.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.494
Did Derek tell you everything?

35:33.215 --> 35:36.707
And I don't just mean going out of control
on the full moons. I mean everything.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.759
He told me about the hunters.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.011
And that's not enough
for you to say no?

35:46.562 --> 35:48.177
Whatever you want
there's other ways to get it.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.562
ljust wanna not eat
lunch alone every day.

35:50.733 --> 35:55.443
If you're looking for friends,
you can do a lot better than Derek.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.278
That really hurts, Scott.

36:00.075 --> 36:03.863
I mean,
if you're going to review me,

36:05.456 --> 36:08.072
at least take a consensus.

36:08.876 --> 36:12.334
Erica, how's life been
for you since we met?

36:14.715 --> 36:16.455
In a word...

36:17.760 --> 36:19.375
transformative.

36:23.641 --> 36:24.847
Baac?

36:25.059 --> 36:27.550
Well, I'm a little bummed
about being a fugitive, but...

36:27.770 --> 36:29.886
other than that, I'm great.

36:30.064 --> 36:32.851
Okay, hold on.
This isn't exactly a fair fight.

36:33.317 --> 36:34.978
Then go home, Scott.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.952
I meant fair for them.

37:43.804 --> 37:47.012
Don't you get it?
He's not doing this for you.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.591
He's just adding to his own power, okay?
It's all about him.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.519
He makes you feel like he's
giving you some kind of gift

37:53.731 --> 37:56.689
when all he's done is turn you
into a bunch of guard dogs!

38:00.779 --> 38:01.985
It's true.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.904
It is about power.

39:09.264 --> 39:12.176
Don't.
You don't wanna be like them.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.519
You're right.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.774
I wanna be like you.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.538
Bitch.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.587
Why aren't you healing?

39:44.758 --> 39:46.544
Because it's from an Alpha.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.798
I think maybe we better
have that talk now.
