No.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.960
Moon, have I ever mentioned
my friend, Christophe,

01:13.119 --> 01:14.920
who's a pastry chef in Paris?

01:15.160 --> 01:15.920
Mmh?

01:16.039 --> 01:20.080
Wow! I bet he has a lot of tips
that could help Moon!

01:20.280 --> 01:21.880
But I don't need help.

01:22.039 --> 01:23.800
I'm a fabulous cook!

I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:37.880 --> 01:41.119
but you know what would be great
right now, Moon?

01:41.280 --> 01:42.759
One of your brainstorms!

01:42.920 --> 01:45.119
So we can go somewhere...

01:45.280 --> 01:46.880
away from my apartment?

01:47.640 --> 01:48.440
I've got it!

01:48.600 --> 01:49.960
Stanley,

01:50.119 --> 01:52.679
could your chef friend
lend me his baking equipment?

01:52.839 --> 01:55.440
I could make
something great for the contest!

01:55.600 --> 01:58.520
I'm sure he'd be happy
to share his kitchen with you.

01:58.679 --> 02:00.000
Then let's get out of here!

02:00.399 --> 02:01.559
Before Moon bakes again.

02:01.839 --> 02:02.759

04:08.839 --> 04:10.160
And work up an appetite.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.560
If you want,
but I can do this all by myself!

and switch the cakes quietly

06:40.039 --> 06:42.120

Quietly. Yes. Good idea.

But it's so much fun
seeing Paris together.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.640

you want to do this by yourself,

09:47.480 --> 09:48.920
Fiou! What do you know?

09:49.079 --> 09:50.040
We did it!

09:50.160 --> 09:52.360
-Now let's get you some...
-Cheese!

09:54.520 --> 09:55.600
Too late?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.839
Oh no!

09:59.439 --> 10:00.720
I'm sorry, Ollie.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.439
But don't worry, I'm having a brainstorm!

10:07.280 --> 10:09.280
Presenting!

10:09.439 --> 10:10.839
The Olliemoonesque!

10:11.000 --> 10:15.640
A mountain of pastry puffs
filled... with...

10:16.240 --> 10:17.720
Cheese!

10:17.959 --> 10:19.640
Oh wow!

10:19.880 --> 10:21.360
[nom nom nom]

10:21.520 --> 10:24.280
Thanks for teaching me
how to make cheese puffs.

10:24.439 --> 10:27.319
Thank you for delivering my cake.

10:27.439 --> 10:28.400
Eh!

10:28.520 --> 10:30.640
Even big kids need help now and then.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.000
[nom nom nom]

10:34.400 --> 10:35.280

10:36.480 --> 10:37.199
<i>Guys!</i>

10:37.360 --> 10:38.000
Guess what!

10:38.120 --> 10:41.079
My cheese puffs won
first place in the contest!

10:41.240 --> 10:42.160
Yay!

10:42.319 --> 10:43.800
You totally deserve it.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.600
So, what's the prize?

10:45.760 --> 10:48.439
A pastry class in...

10:48.600 --> 10:49.480
Wait for it...

10:49.640 --> 10:50.800
Paris!

10:50.959 --> 10:52.360
Guess I'll be heading back there.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.439
<i>Woohoo!</i>

10:53.600 --> 10:55.400
Yes! Take your time please!

10:55.560 --> 10:57.040
