16:22.940 --> 16:26.649
Nikita just assaulted the deputy
prime minister of a UN-recognized--

-What matters is she's captured.
-Wait, wait, shut up, everyone.

I will send them your head in a box.

-He's buying some time.

Tell the minister of defense to radio
the checkpoints and close the borders now.

There's no way we can keep a lid on this.
No containment possible.

Look, even if Kosovo flips out
and seals its borders...

18:42.830 --> 18:45.367
...doesn't mean Division

18:48.085 --> 18:51.873

to make sure we can't cause damage again.

Well, I didn't, uh, make the leg.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.496
I merely applied the technology,
and returned to service it and collect data.

Same as I used to do at Division.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.378
