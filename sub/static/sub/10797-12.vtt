00:02.620 --> 00:08.283
Captain's log, star date 41242.4.
Our last assignment has taken us

00:08.411 --> 00:11.359
into the remote
Omicron Theta star system,

00:11.492 --> 00:14.500
home of our android crew member,
Lt. Cmdr Data.

00:14.631 --> 00:17.035
Although we're due at an assignment,

00:17.171 --> 00:20.912
I have decided to visit Data's
home planet for a few hours

00:21.044 --> 00:24.987
in the hopes of unravelling
the mystery of his beginnings.

00:25.623 --> 00:29.282
Sir, we are 20 minutes
from Omicron Theta, mark.

00:30.579 --> 00:33.988
Stand by for sub warp.
Head for standard orbit of planet.

00:34.117 --> 00:38.249
- I wonder why Data's not here.
- He said he wanted to be alone.

00:38.381 --> 00:41.791
Perhaps this is a bigger moment
for him than we thought.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.497 --> 00:55.492
- What are you doing?
- Sneezing.

00:56.494 --> 00:59.606
- Have you got a cold?
- A cold what?

00:59.742 --> 01:02.660
It's a disease
Mom said people used to get.

01:03.462 --> 01:06.540
But humans still sneeze
for other reasons.

01:06.672 --> 01:09.156
And I cannot seem to do it right.

01:12.289 --> 01:17.868
Why practise sneezing? We're going to
your home planet for the first time.

01:17.994 --> 01:21.855
- Aren't you interested in that?
- More than interested. Fascinated.

01:21.991 --> 01:25.769
One might say agog.
But I also find sneezing interesting.

01:29.795 --> 01:33.074
Capt Picard wishes
to see you on the bridge.

01:33.916 --> 01:37.825
Captain, confirming Class-M
reading there.

01:37.956 --> 01:41.235
But sensors show no life readings.
Not even vegetation.

01:41.370 --> 01:45.312
Strange. The cruiser
that found Data reported farmlands.

01:46.658 --> 01:50.862
- Want to take her into orbit, Data?
- No, thank you, sir.

02:14.362 --> 02:17.312
Continue on into close parking orbit.

02:17.443 --> 02:18.698
Aye, sir.

02:19.584 --> 02:21.905
I could say
"home sweet home", sir,

02:22.041 --> 02:25.036
if I understood how
the word "sweet" applies.

02:25.163 --> 02:29.450
- It usually refers to memories.
- To one's own memories.

02:29.577 --> 02:32.572
Do the memories you have
include farms, Data?

02:32.700 --> 02:36.608
Affirmative. But the colony's
principal interest was science.

02:36.739 --> 02:40.066
How can you hold the memories
of 411 people,

02:40.194 --> 02:43.830
if that means every experience,
every day of their life?

02:43.959 --> 02:48.695
It does not. Unfortunately.
It's the knowledge they accumulated.

02:48.830 --> 02:52.275
Actually, I am deficient
in basic human information.

02:52.410 --> 02:54.399
Sneezing, for example.

02:55.076 --> 02:57.360
Approaching close parking orbit.

02:57.489 --> 03:00.107
Assemble your away party, Commander.

03:01.487 --> 03:04.518
This must be exciting for you.

03:04.651 --> 03:09.079
I'm tempted to lead the away team,
but my First Officer may object.

03:09.207 --> 03:13.326
What would Starfleet say?
An Earth colony did disappear there.

03:13.457 --> 03:14.613
You see?

03:16.785 --> 03:18.940
Now in close parking orbit, sir.

03:19.324 --> 03:23.267
Mr. Data,... welcome home.

03:47.362 --> 03:50.477
Space, the final frontier.

03:52.150 --> 03:56.094
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:56.231 --> 04:00.410
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

04:02.202 --> 04:05.895
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

04:06.783 --> 04:10.479
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:13.154 --> 05:16.568
First Officer's log, star date 4124.5.

05:16.702 --> 05:18.899
We have found Data's home

05:19.032 --> 05:20.983
to be a completely dead world.

05:21.112 --> 05:25.482
Lifeless vegetation, no insects,
not even soil bacteria.

05:25.608 --> 05:29.518
What is it that could kill
everything on an entire planet?

05:34.770 --> 05:38.002
Recording signal
locked onto the Enterprise, sir.

05:38.148 --> 05:40.776
This looks like anything
but farmland.

05:40.906 --> 05:42.069
Agreed, sir.

05:42.739 --> 05:46.103
The soil appears
almost completely lifeless.

05:46.237 --> 05:50.394
This is the position in
the Tripoli log. Recognize anything?

05:50.526 --> 05:52.597
The land contours are familiar.

05:52.732 --> 05:55.513
Topographically,
this is the correct area.

05:55.646 --> 05:59.684
This once was rich farmland,
I'd say 20 to 30 years ago.

05:59.809 --> 06:02.261
I was discovered 26 years ago.

06:02.391 --> 06:07.815
I'd say that everything was dead
or dying at the time Data was found.

06:07.946 --> 06:11.061
I was found 20 meters
in that direction, sir.

06:17.729 --> 06:22.051
Data, any idea why you were given
the colonists' memories?

06:22.185 --> 06:24.338
I feel that it was done hurriedly,

06:24.475 --> 06:26.715
but I know little more. Here.

06:26.848 --> 06:29.609
This is where the cruiser's
landing party

06:29.738 --> 06:32.735
found the signal device
that led them here.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.440
And they found me lying there.

06:41.438 --> 06:43.842
You were just lying in the open?

06:43.978 --> 06:46.844
No identity record,
no instructions?

06:47.476 --> 06:49.347
Only a layer of dust.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.842
What's the first thing you remember?

06:51.972 --> 06:54.316
Opening my eyes.

06:54.446 --> 06:57.773
Looking into the eyes
of the Tripoli landing party.

06:57.903 --> 07:00.057
They believed the signal device

07:00.191 --> 07:02.892
sensed their presence
and activated me.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.972
Then this spot was your birthplace.

07:07.311 --> 07:08.555
Commander.

07:10.851 --> 07:13.717
I think I've got
this place figured out.

07:13.848 --> 07:16.251
This was very cleverly done

07:16.390 --> 07:20.190
to make this look like
a natural hollow in the terrain.

07:20.319 --> 07:23.235
There are signs
it was constructed in a hurry,

07:23.358 --> 07:25.180
as if to hide something.

07:25.317 --> 07:28.561
Yes. That was it, Geordi.

07:28.688 --> 07:30.806
This awakens a memory remnant.

07:30.938 --> 07:33.768
The colonists
hoped to remain hidden.

07:33.892 --> 07:36.640
But their fear of being discovered...

07:37.223 --> 07:40.054
..led to their storing information
in me.

07:42.304 --> 07:44.351
Yeah! Thought so.

08:14.065 --> 08:16.764
No life readings in here either, sir.

09:16.178 --> 09:19.707
The colonists' laboratory.
Extremely well equipped.

09:19.841 --> 09:21.830
Does this stir any memories?

09:21.966 --> 09:26.266
Only a vague impression of some
of my functions being tested here.

09:31.973 --> 09:33.929
Posted by proud parents?

09:34.972 --> 09:38.879
It depicts...
something that feels familiar, sir.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.384
And dangerous.

09:41.010 --> 09:43.792
But I have no idea
what it represents.

09:44.508 --> 09:46.165
And that is all.

09:47.130 --> 09:48.720
Except...

09:49.521 --> 09:51.806
..for an impression...

09:52.352 --> 09:57.136
..of this being
a Dr. Soong's work area.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.213
Who?

09:58.348 --> 10:01.758
- Dr. Noonien Soong?
- He was called that here.

10:01.887 --> 10:05.131
But he travelled here
under a different name.

10:05.260 --> 10:09.500
Dr. Soong, my friend, was Earth's
foremost robotic scientist.

10:09.632 --> 10:13.411
Until he tried to realize Asimov's
dream of a positronic brain.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.424
A positronic brain.
He promised so much.

10:17.559 --> 10:21.764
Then, when he failed completely,
Dr. Soong disappeared.

10:21.890 --> 10:25.384
Now we know he went somewhere
to try a second time.

10:25.511 --> 10:28.212
Data, Geordi, we'll look at this lab.

10:28.343 --> 10:31.088
You and Lt. Worf
reconnoiter the corridors.

10:31.216 --> 10:32.245
Aye, sir.

11:04.684 --> 11:06.887
Data, it's you.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.297
An epidermal mould.

11:09.430 --> 11:12.261
To give your exterior
the desired finish.

11:12.387 --> 11:15.465
- Lt. Yar to Cmdr Riker.
- Come in, Lieutenant.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.086
Sir, this installation
can hold hundreds of people.

11:19.214 --> 11:21.417
But all that's here is empty beds.

11:21.547 --> 11:25.041
Thank you. Complete your record scans
and report back.

11:25.168 --> 11:29.349
Cmdr Riker, looks like
some sort of storage area.

11:46.379 --> 11:49.956
- How many more Datas are there?
- Looks like just two.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.653
I mean, that and the real Data.

12:06.673 --> 12:07.999
Commander,...

12:09.088 --> 12:11.326
..can this be another me?

12:13.251 --> 12:15.122
Or possibly my brother?

12:16.417 --> 12:18.484
I honestly don't know, Data.

12:21.054 --> 12:24.169
- He needs assembling.
- He?

12:25.135 --> 12:30.002
Data, we don't know
that this can become alive.

12:31.380 --> 12:34.541
It is very important
for me to know, sir.

12:35.752 --> 12:40.039
I never dreamed it was possible
that I might find some link...

12:40.708 --> 12:42.922
..with a form like my own.

12:43.575 --> 12:47.504
Understood. We'll take it back
to the ship with us.

12:54.547 --> 12:58.585
Captain's log, star date 41242.45.

12:58.711 --> 13:02.748
Despite having only a few hours
to explore Data's home planet,

13:02.874 --> 13:06.866
we discovered something which
may explain Data's beginnings,

13:06.997 --> 13:12.042
if we can properly assemble and
communicate with what we've found.

13:46.712 --> 13:50.700
Signal from the Captain.
They need you at the debriefing.

13:51.705 --> 13:55.530
I have been anxious to hear
the Chief Engineer's opinion.

13:55.664 --> 13:58.303
Do you believe
he can be made to function?

13:58.436 --> 14:01.334
It includes
all the components in your body.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.580
Not that we fully understand
your construction.

14:04.714 --> 14:08.999
We have our top specialists
working on its construction.

14:10.001 --> 14:11.458
Just one thing.

14:11.584 --> 14:15.989
Without disassembling you, of course,
if we should need more...

14:17.913 --> 14:23.520
If we need to compare this with
the way... you're put together...

14:26.882 --> 14:29.962
Bringing it here was right,
Number One.

14:32.377 --> 14:37.114
Data, if your duplicate functions,
it may answer a lot of questions.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.742
Does it appear to have...

14:44.618 --> 14:46.573
..all your parts?

14:46.699 --> 14:48.517
Completely, sir.

14:48.648 --> 14:50.167
Will...

14:52.296 --> 14:54.416
Will we know how to turn it on?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.414
Alright.

14:59.085 --> 15:02.860
Legitimate questions
need not be asked apologetically.

15:02.997 --> 15:05.661
You feel uncomfortable about
your duplicate.

15:05.788 --> 15:09.363
We feel uncomfortable, too,
for no logical reason.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.659
If it's awkward to be reminded
that Data is a machine,

15:12.791 --> 15:17.162
remember that we are merely
a different variety of machine.

15:17.295 --> 15:19.699
In our case, electrochemical.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.867
Let's handle this
as we would anything else.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.373
Agreed, Captain.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.369
Let's begin with you, Data.

15:26.496 --> 15:30.074
Well, sir,
a good starting point may be

15:30.202 --> 15:32.487
why was I given human form?

15:32.618 --> 15:36.525
To make it easier for humans
to relate to you.

15:36.655 --> 15:39.663
Maybe your designer had
something else to prove.

15:39.795 --> 15:44.249
That human-shaped robots
need not be clumsy or limited.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.613
You operate as well as we do, Data.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.491
Better, in some ways, sir.

15:50.163 --> 15:54.616
Look at this. Could be a link to
the disappearance of the colonists.

15:54.743 --> 15:58.866
It was displayed in the lab.
It could be a child's imagination,

15:58.989 --> 16:01.656
but several children
did similar drawings.

16:03.384 --> 16:05.874
Dr. Crusher to the Captain.

16:06.001 --> 16:08.750
We very much need Mr. Data's help.

16:11.623 --> 16:13.364
He's on his way, Doctor.

16:19.326 --> 16:22.903
Is the synthomometer
reading positive or negative?

16:23.989 --> 16:25.813
Press your fingers there.

16:30.211 --> 16:31.453
There.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.078
It operates almost as a switch.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.907
And these small projections?

16:39.579 --> 16:41.734
An android alarm clock.

16:42.826 --> 16:44.731
Is that amusing?

16:46.740 --> 16:50.020
They time how long
I remain unconscious.

16:50.153 --> 16:53.760
Are you certain about us using
these heating devices?

16:53.896 --> 16:56.914
- I will feel nothing at all.
- Marvellous.

16:57.040 --> 17:01.282
It should be simpler once we see
how your circuitry is connected.

17:06.824 --> 17:10.944
I won't mention it to anyone.
You have my word.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.736
If you had an off switch, Doctor,...

17:14.277 --> 17:16.645
..would you not keep it secret?

17:18.209 --> 17:19.990
I guess I would.

17:32.491 --> 17:35.901
Notice the micro-circuitry here.
And here.

17:38.153 --> 17:41.598
And another fibroid-like
connection here.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.114
Let's close up.

17:56.947 --> 18:00.607
It seemed to go well,
thanks to a look inside Mr. Data.

18:00.736 --> 18:03.483
But there are no
signs of consciousness yet.

18:11.663 --> 18:14.362
It certainly is
a good match for Data.

18:14.495 --> 18:17.193
Do you think so, really?

18:18.076 --> 18:20.359
I wonder which was made first.

18:21.905 --> 18:23.233
He was.

18:26.526 --> 18:31.229
But they found him to be imperfect,
and I was made to replace him.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.065
You may call me Lore.

18:51.526 --> 18:56.806
But I am also troubled by
it describing you as imperfect.

18:56.938 --> 18:59.469
Human language
gives me difficulty, too.

18:59.607 --> 19:02.818
It could mean I lack certain
abilities he possesses.

19:02.951 --> 19:04.278
I wonder.

19:04.408 --> 19:09.737
But the point is, whether you and it
have the same capabilities.

19:09.865 --> 19:13.985
We do, sir.
And your referring to him as "it"

19:14.109 --> 19:18.645
suggests that l, too,
fit into the category of a thing.

19:20.521 --> 19:22.060
I see your point.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.563
My apologies.

19:24.691 --> 19:26.276
Gladly accepted, sir.

19:26.411 --> 19:29.322
As for Lore's abilities,
his syntax and grammar

19:29.448 --> 19:32.445
suggests he was given
human memories like mine.

19:32.571 --> 19:35.567
You have equal strength
and mental abilities?

19:35.695 --> 19:37.020
I believe so, sir.

19:37.152 --> 19:40.976
Which requires that I now ask
a very serious question.

19:41.106 --> 19:45.892
Since the two of you are so
closely related to each other...

19:46.020 --> 19:49.472
The answer, sir,
is that my loyalty is to you.

19:49.602 --> 19:51.938
And Starfleet. Completely.

19:54.573 --> 19:58.231
Thank you, Commander.
I was certain of that.

19:58.736 --> 20:03.721
Helm control is here. The ship's
heading is given in degrees.

20:03.859 --> 20:06.890
360 of them
in a full circle this way.

20:07.020 --> 20:09.343
- Then you say "mark".
- On the nose.

20:09.479 --> 20:13.067
That separates it from another
360-degree circle this way

20:13.198 --> 20:15.444
on a right angle to this one.

20:15.575 --> 20:18.320
By ordering a heading
so many degrees this way

20:18.448 --> 20:20.272
and so many this way,

20:20.404 --> 20:23.648
the ship can travel
in all three dimensions.

20:23.778 --> 20:26.345
The square of the hypotenuse
of a right triangle?

20:26.483 --> 20:30.176
Is equal to the sum of the square
of the other two...

20:30.314 --> 20:32.267
..something.

20:32.395 --> 20:35.426
Which I once heard,
but never understood.

20:35.560 --> 20:40.521
You'll learn more when the Captain
approves your being on the bridge.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.445
Have I committed an offence?

20:42.572 --> 20:46.811
You will find many rules on
starships that must be learnt.

20:47.860 --> 20:49.730
You're very clever, Wesley.

20:49.859 --> 20:52.558
I now have duties to perform.
Correct?

20:52.689 --> 20:55.685
Were you ever this anxious
to please, Data?

20:55.811 --> 21:00.016
Never. I judge Lore
to be superior in that desire.

21:00.144 --> 21:03.827
Because I was designed to be
so human, my brother.

21:03.961 --> 21:05.944
I enjoy pleasing humans.

21:06.071 --> 21:10.856
"My brother".
That has a nice sound to it, Data.

21:10.984 --> 21:14.229
You consider it important
to please humans?

21:14.358 --> 21:16.263
It's not important?

21:17.440 --> 21:21.266
There are many things of importance.
Some more than others.

21:36.358 --> 21:39.307
Cmdr Riker's hypotenuse question
tricked you

21:39.440 --> 21:43.679
into showing your knowledge was
greater than you were indicating.

21:43.811 --> 21:47.174
He didn't seem that clever.
I'll be more careful.

21:47.308 --> 21:50.174
You tend to underestimate humans.

21:50.306 --> 21:53.064
Praising young Wesley on the helm...

21:53.192 --> 21:54.459
A child!

21:54.593 --> 21:59.183
He has a child's body. But we
have found him to be much more.

22:00.608 --> 22:03.721
Thank you for that information, too.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.307
You do care about how I perform.

22:06.436 --> 22:10.133
I pledge to be worthy
of your teaching, my brother.

22:10.308 --> 22:13.055
Try not to be jealous
of my abilities.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.339
What information are you requesting?

22:35.057 --> 22:38.387
Everything available
on a Dr. Noonien Soong.

22:39.639 --> 22:41.960
Good old often-wrong Soong.

22:44.801 --> 22:46.523
A joke, brother.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.560
Actually, he was
a genius by human standards.

22:51.438 --> 22:55.511
But he destroyed his reputation
by making wild promises

22:55.644 --> 23:00.296
about his positronic brain design.
Almost all of which failed.

23:00.432 --> 23:03.343
Promises he later proved to be true.

23:05.137 --> 23:08.095
Which made you and me possible,
brother.

23:09.629 --> 23:11.806
Our beloved father!

23:13.439 --> 23:17.134
Will I soon have a uniform
like that, brother?

23:17.269 --> 23:21.971
I got mine after four years
at the Academy, three as ensign,

23:22.099 --> 23:25.130
Ten or 12 on space duties
at lieutenant grade...

23:25.265 --> 23:29.883
A system designed to compensate
for limited human ability.

23:30.009 --> 23:34.413
And you, brother, are beginning
to think as a human.

23:34.544 --> 23:38.260
You and I are completely different
from them.

23:38.397 --> 23:42.091
Are you truly satisfied
with the knowledge and memory

23:42.226 --> 23:45.092
of a few hundred human colonists?

23:45.224 --> 23:49.878
Suppose it could reflect thousands?
Or millions?

23:50.013 --> 23:55.424
Or the knowledge of hundreds of
millions of life forms of every kind?

23:58.313 --> 23:59.831
How?

24:00.813 --> 24:02.719
We will discuss that in time.

24:02.854 --> 24:08.004
And will we also discuss, Lore,
which of us was constructed first?

24:08.601 --> 24:09.972
It would be foolish...

24:11.513 --> 24:14.000
..to underestimate you, brother.

24:14.139 --> 24:18.292
Yes, I lied when I said you were
made first, but with good reason.

24:18.426 --> 24:21.755
Dr. Soong made me perfect
in his first attempt.

24:21.880 --> 24:26.345
But he made me so human,
the colonists became envious of me.

24:26.479 --> 24:28.763
You lived with the colonists?

24:29.559 --> 24:33.466
Until they petitioned Soong
to make a more... comfortable,

24:33.599 --> 24:36.383
less... perfect android.

24:37.140 --> 24:40.218
In other words, you brother.

24:44.633 --> 24:49.112
Haven't you noticed how easily
I handle human speech?

24:49.241 --> 24:51.058
I use their contractions.

24:51.187 --> 24:55.093
For example,
I say "can't" or "isn't".

24:55.224 --> 24:58.671
You say "cannot" and "is not".

25:09.548 --> 25:11.703
A very old joke.

25:11.836 --> 25:15.802
But you also have trouble
with their humour. Am I right?

25:17.017 --> 25:18.557
Quite true.

25:18.683 --> 25:23.172
I keep trying to be more human,
and keep failing.

25:24.303 --> 25:27.417
Do you realize,... brother,...

25:28.343 --> 25:31.007
..l can help you become more human?

25:31.550 --> 25:33.622
And do you realize, Lore,

25:33.754 --> 25:37.882
that I am obligated to report
all this to our ship's Captain?

25:39.703 --> 25:43.635
I assumed as much
when I began studying you.

25:44.639 --> 25:48.583
May I use this to learn more about
this vessel and its customs?

25:48.719 --> 25:51.834
Use it to describe
your time among the colonists,

25:51.967 --> 25:55.128
including all you know
about what happened to them.

25:55.258 --> 25:59.827
I promise a report
of great detail and accuracy.

26:00.836 --> 26:04.396
Thank you, Lore.
I now have duties to perform.

26:09.098 --> 26:11.217
Unless you need something more.

26:11.346 --> 26:15.419
I have more than I dreamed
possible, brother.

26:39.757 --> 26:43.002
Captain's log, star date 41242.5.

26:43.130 --> 26:47.202
Thanks to Lore's report, we now know
what happened to the colonists.

26:47.337 --> 26:51.029
Using a child's drawing,
enhanced by Lore's description,

26:51.168 --> 26:53.420
our computer constructed the image

26:53.557 --> 26:57.802
of a great crystalline entity
which feeds on life,

26:57.930 --> 27:01.790
insatiably ravenous for
the life force in living forms,

27:01.925 --> 27:06.214
capable of stripping all life
from an entire world.

27:06.338 --> 27:10.544
- How did Data escape? Or Lore?
- Lore had been disassembled.

27:10.669 --> 27:13.617
He explained it as jealousy
from the colonists.

27:13.752 --> 27:15.702
Data wasn't yet alive.

27:15.832 --> 27:19.438
Data could be left out
in no danger from that creature.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.799
Whatever happened to the colonists,

27:21.928 --> 27:25.504
he'd be found by the first crew
to respond to his signal.

27:25.635 --> 27:29.920
So Dr. Soong left proof
that his experiment did work.

27:30.047 --> 27:34.416
Captain, how believable
do you find that crystal thing?

27:35.001 --> 27:40.615
With so little of even our galaxy
explored, it is at least possible.

27:40.748 --> 27:43.967
Data, are you expecting Lore
to come up here?

27:44.102 --> 27:47.135
- He left your quarters.
- To go...?

27:47.260 --> 27:50.540
My turbo sensors say
he went to deck four. Worf?

27:50.675 --> 27:54.746
He examined some work tools
and fine-grind quadratanium.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.283
Which is used in our construction.

27:57.420 --> 28:01.954
That compound is no more suspicious
than a human looking for an ointment.

28:02.084 --> 28:03.906
But I should check it out.

28:04.038 --> 28:08.844
You're watching everything he does?
Is that the act of a brother?

28:08.974 --> 28:12.457
It's the act of a Starfleet officer
obeying his Captain.

28:17.878 --> 28:19.288
Captain?

28:20.127 --> 28:22.746
Speaking strictly as Security Chief,

28:22.875 --> 28:25.161
how much can you trust Data now?

28:29.371 --> 28:33.290
I trust him completely.
But everyone should realize

28:33.424 --> 28:37.045
that that was
a legitimate security question.

28:37.175 --> 28:38.583
Thank you, sir.

29:01.295 --> 29:04.793
Lesson number one
in becoming more human.

29:04.921 --> 29:07.586
You must observe all human customs.

29:08.418 --> 29:09.662
Champagne?

29:09.793 --> 29:15.371
An ancient ritual practised when
they observe events of importance.

29:23.168 --> 29:28.250
My brother, I toast
our discovery of each other.

29:28.381 --> 29:31.461
May it fill our lives
with new meaning.

29:37.291 --> 29:43.199
I have some doubts about the value
of human customs... in this...

29:46.532 --> 29:47.911
My brother!

29:49.307 --> 29:52.952
And let us toast, also, Dr. Soong,...

29:53.587 --> 29:58.489
..who gave me the full richness
of human needs and ambitions.

29:58.625 --> 30:03.278
A perfect match for my mind,
my body.

30:03.415 --> 30:05.035
Brother...

30:10.741 --> 30:12.950
And let us toast, also,...

30:13.926 --> 30:19.247
..the Great Crystal Entity,
with whom I learned to communicate.

30:22.209 --> 30:24.907
Before Dr. Soong disassembled me,

30:25.039 --> 30:29.444
I earned its gratitude by
revealing the way to the colonists.

30:29.578 --> 30:34.317
Imagine its gratitude when I give it
the life on this vessel!

30:37.994 --> 30:39.639
This is strange, sir.

30:39.768 --> 30:42.956
I show Cmdr Data transmitting
on a subspace channel.

30:43.084 --> 30:47.077
I know Data's been researching
Dr. Soong's background.

30:47.206 --> 30:49.077
Let's be sure.

30:52.246 --> 30:54.909
Would you look in on Cmdr Data?
Discreetly?

30:55.035 --> 30:56.313
Yes, sir.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.878
Crystal Entity.

31:04.008 --> 31:09.243
Upon arriving here, you can identify
me as the machine named Data.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.412
End of message.

31:14.536 --> 31:16.195
Come in, please.

31:19.617 --> 31:21.324
Glad you are here.

31:21.448 --> 31:24.017
Lore attacked me.
I had to turn him off.

31:24.156 --> 31:25.812
Why did he do that, Data?

31:25.945 --> 31:30.101
He discovered we have been using
sensors to follow what he does.

31:33.790 --> 31:36.820
I practised his facial tic.
Do I have it right?

31:37.371 --> 31:39.776
I'd suggest you forget
imitating him.

31:40.743 --> 31:44.189
If you'd said "we've"
instead of "we have",

31:44.326 --> 31:46.727
I might have
suspected you were Lore.

31:46.865 --> 31:50.854
Yes. I do use language
more formally than Lore.

31:50.987 --> 31:54.121
Please inform the Captain
I will come to report this.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.150
Aye, sir.

32:57.948 --> 33:02.896
Wes, tell me again how Data said
he immobilized Lore.

33:05.150 --> 33:09.378
He told me he just turned him off,
Mom. Doctor.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.944
Question, Mr. Data.

33:16.075 --> 33:20.149
Did you not swear me to secrecy
about your off switch?

33:20.988 --> 33:22.527
A change of mind.

33:22.656 --> 33:25.934
If I cannot trust the bridge crew,
whom can l?

33:27.692 --> 33:30.938
Captain, bogey coming in
on a five o'clock tangent.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.937
No ID signal, Captain.

33:33.070 --> 33:36.391
- Main viewer on tangent.
- Shields up. Yellow alert.

33:36.527 --> 33:39.568
Friendly greetings all languages,
all frequencies.

33:43.489 --> 33:46.059
I can't believe it can overtake us
this fast.

33:46.196 --> 33:48.185
Beautiful, isn't it?

33:52.482 --> 33:53.975
I recognize it, sir.

33:54.355 --> 33:56.808
It's the crystal image
Lore described.

33:59.923 --> 34:01.735
My God!

34:15.525 --> 34:17.678
Still no ID, sir.

34:17.815 --> 34:19.969
Also no answer to our inquiries.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.835
Did you get a direct look?

34:24.963 --> 34:27.822
It's like a giant snowflake,
but more complex.

34:27.949 --> 34:31.395
The entire electromagnetic spectrum
is inside it.

34:31.532 --> 34:35.060
- But I've no idea what it is.
- Thank you. Data.

34:37.069 --> 34:41.188
Anything else that Lore could tell us
may be important.

34:41.313 --> 34:44.891
- Can you control and question him?
- I must examine him.

34:46.726 --> 34:52.362
Captain. Recommend that you do not
let him roam the ship freely.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.603
Ensign?

34:53.737 --> 34:56.735
Wesley is being alert
and responsible.

34:56.864 --> 35:00.724
Something to be encouraged. Come.
You can watch everything I do.

35:00.859 --> 35:02.398
Not if I have a choice.

35:02.525 --> 35:05.556
Enough! When addressing
a senior officer...

35:05.687 --> 35:07.677
As his trainer, it's my fault.

35:07.813 --> 35:12.099
You will show proper respect.
I will accompany you to make certain.

35:12.225 --> 35:14.199
With your approval, sir.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.301
Be careful of Lore.

35:34.936 --> 35:37.887
Good. He is still unconscious.

35:38.528 --> 35:42.015
Notice the same twitch,
even though he is unconscious?

35:42.654 --> 35:47.437
Stay back. We may have problems
if he senses someone else is near.

35:55.312 --> 35:57.680
I have a few questions
to ask you.

35:59.059 --> 36:00.716
Lore, it is Data!

36:01.431 --> 36:04.738
He senses you.
I cannot control him if you stay.

36:04.875 --> 36:06.851
I will record what he says.

36:06.980 --> 36:09.141
Bring it to the bridge immediately.

36:18.103 --> 36:22.592
And you want to be as stupid
as them, dear brother?

36:38.314 --> 36:41.512
- Well, Number One?
- It was Lore, sir.

36:41.648 --> 36:43.302
Same facial twitch.

36:43.437 --> 36:46.004
Lying unconscious as Data described.

36:46.144 --> 36:49.636
It became violent, apparently
sensing Wesley and l...

36:49.764 --> 36:53.015
Or is it Lore pretending
to be Data and faking it?

36:53.144 --> 36:56.713
I asked for Cmdr Riker's report,
Acting Ensign Crusher.

36:56.850 --> 37:00.353
If you can't accept the limits
of that appointment...

37:00.481 --> 37:01.725
Captain!

37:10.391 --> 37:12.214
Deflector shields holding.

37:12.349 --> 37:16.920
Torpedoes and main phasers to ready.
Go to red alert, please.

37:20.544 --> 37:22.051
Weapons ready, sir.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.602
No, Captain, let me talk to it.

37:24.732 --> 37:27.017
You didn't say you could do that.

37:32.017 --> 37:35.877
- Affirmative. Talk to it.
- Open hailing frequencies.

37:37.056 --> 37:41.509
Crystal form,
I identify myself as Data.

37:41.636 --> 37:44.487
Advising you to stop your attack.

37:44.615 --> 37:46.710
The humans here are powerful.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.854
Capable of injuring
or even destroying you.

37:57.184 --> 37:59.848
Now, I call that communicating!

37:59.973 --> 38:02.803
Suggest moving fast
to confirm what I told it.

38:02.927 --> 38:06.705
Permission to use the large
transporter in cargo room three

38:06.843 --> 38:10.487
to beam up some living pattern.
Perhaps a large tree.

38:10.625 --> 38:14.308
- Which you'll beam to the entity?
- Correct, Riker.

38:14.437 --> 38:17.636
Ship's phasers
will then disintegrate it,

38:17.768 --> 38:20.138
proving we are dangerous.

38:20.893 --> 38:22.217
Make it so.

38:22.348 --> 38:23.757
Sir?

38:25.929 --> 38:27.256
Do it.

38:34.528 --> 38:38.178
Sir, I know this may finish me
as Acting Ensign...

38:38.311 --> 38:39.888
Shut up, Wesley!

38:42.934 --> 38:47.139
- Let me know what he does.
- Aye, sir.

38:47.263 --> 38:49.254
"Shut up, Wesley"?!

38:49.972 --> 38:51.427
Doctor...

38:52.469 --> 38:55.037
Since I am finished here,
may I say...

38:55.175 --> 38:56.288
Shut up, Wesley!

38:56.423 --> 38:59.896
..that what I have said
would've been listened to

39:00.032 --> 39:02.808
if it came from an adult officer!

39:04.102 --> 39:06.848
Permission to go to my quarters, sir.

39:06.976 --> 39:09.886
Agreed. Doctor, go with him.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.763
You're putting me off the bridge?

39:15.303 --> 39:19.459
I'm asking you to keep an eye
on your son during this.

39:27.807 --> 39:29.716
Emergency, close!

39:31.932 --> 39:34.419
Now, show me your warrior fierceness!

39:53.935 --> 39:58.966
I'll look. But I shouldn't
have let you talk me into this.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.796
It's Data! He's been hurt.

40:06.840 --> 40:11.127
- You know how to turn them on.
- This is very serious!

40:11.670 --> 40:15.107
So, just tell me to
"Shut up, Wesley", and I will.

40:16.332 --> 40:18.387
You're being very unfair, Wes.

40:19.973 --> 40:23.135
Data! The crystal thing
is outside the ship.

40:23.262 --> 40:25.298
Lore is loose on the inside.

40:25.428 --> 40:27.418
How badly are you hurt?

40:27.551 --> 40:31.873
I will function sufficiently...
to stop Lore.

40:36.670 --> 40:38.886
Crystal Entity form,...

40:39.606 --> 40:41.448
..it's your old friend.

40:50.759 --> 40:55.249
Very good.
You've understood perfectly so far.

40:55.380 --> 40:59.075
Next, I will signal that
I'm transporting something out.

40:59.211 --> 41:03.079
The deflector shields
will turn off for a moment,

41:03.216 --> 41:06.159
and if you move in at that time...

41:07.718 --> 41:09.795
How sad, dear brother.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.759
You make me wish
I were an only child.

41:22.420 --> 41:25.084
Then why this marvellous gift?

41:25.834 --> 41:28.592
The troublesome little man-child.

41:29.521 --> 41:33.249
Are you prepared for the death
you've earned, little man?

41:33.389 --> 41:36.833
If you take one more step
towards my son...

41:38.801 --> 41:40.670
Motherhood!

41:43.879 --> 41:48.287
Back off, or I'll turn
your little man into a torch.

41:48.416 --> 41:53.293
I promise him exquisite pain
unless you obey me, too, brother.

41:53.426 --> 41:55.731
Move away, Data. Please!

41:56.956 --> 42:02.300
Do you see now the advantages
of being completely human?

42:03.132 --> 42:05.088
It includes kindness.

42:05.631 --> 42:08.296
I give you your life, Doctor.

42:08.419 --> 42:10.576
Go home. Quickly.

42:11.210 --> 42:13.494
And I may not injure your son at all.

42:13.625 --> 42:15.744
I will stay with Wesley.

42:15.874 --> 42:20.522
Go! Or he'll be shrieking
by the count of five.

42:20.650 --> 42:22.911
One, two,...

42:24.552 --> 42:25.925
..three,...

42:26.051 --> 42:27.956
..four...

42:28.673 --> 42:33.373
Thank you for my human qualities,
Dr. Soong! Wait!

42:34.503 --> 42:38.031
A small payment
for your son's misdeeds.

42:55.919 --> 42:57.377
The transporter!

43:05.204 --> 43:06.531
Wesley, now!

43:25.416 --> 43:28.115
Lore's gone, sir. Permanently.

43:34.890 --> 43:38.786
Doctor, now that Wesley's safe,
go to sickbay at once.

43:39.047 --> 43:42.705
Captain, the crystal thing
has begun to move away.

43:54.371 --> 43:55.828
Are you alright?

43:56.411 --> 43:58.159
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

44:00.268 --> 44:03.876
Get rid of that damn twitch
and put on the correct uniform.

44:04.337 --> 44:05.713
Yes, Captain.

44:06.545 --> 44:09.623
- Are you able to return to duty?
- Yes, sir.

44:09.751 --> 44:13.361
Then do so. Let the bridge know
all is well here.

44:13.498 --> 44:14.777
Aye, sir.

44:18.662 --> 44:22.485
It's gone, sir.
Without Lore, it couldn't reach us.

44:22.617 --> 44:25.176
We're overdue a computer refit.

44:25.307 --> 44:30.751
Do you ever wonder if Data is more
human or less human than we want?

44:32.086 --> 44:34.951
I wish we were all
as well balanced, sir.

44:35.081 --> 44:36.457
Agreed.
