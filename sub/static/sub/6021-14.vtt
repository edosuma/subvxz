00:04.971 --> 00:08.702
Maura, I want you to know,
I've given this a lot of thought.

00:08.875 --> 00:12.504
I'm sorry, but we have to break up.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.678
No.

00:18.284 --> 00:21.185
-What's that?
-We're not breaking up.

00:23.790 --> 00:24.916
We're not?

00:25.392 --> 00:27.053
No.

00:33.466 --> 00:34.956
All right.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.772
-She said no?
-She said no.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.102
What did you do?

00:44.511 --> 00:46.206
What could I do?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.904
We fooled around
and went to a movie.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.608
George, both parties don't have
to consent to a breakup.

00:52.786 --> 00:56.449
It's not like you're launching missiles
and you both have to turn your keys.

00:57.757 --> 01:01.124
You didn't make a convincing case.
Let me hear your arguments.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.592
-Well, I don't really like her.
-That's good.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.924
-I don't find her attractive.
-Solid.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.761
-I'd like to sleep with other women.
-Always popular.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.836
Sometimes at restaurants
she talks to her food.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.803
"Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes,
you are so good."

01:15.308 --> 01:16.502
You have an airtight case.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.304
-And in bed--
-I'm afraid we're out of time.

01:21.781 --> 01:22.770
-Hey.
-What?

01:22.949 --> 01:25.747
Check these out.
These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks...

01:25.919 --> 01:27.784
...that he wore
in the movie <i>Cinderfella.</i>

01:27.954 --> 01:29.148
I got them at an auction.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.756
I got some cufflinks
I could have loaned you.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.723
Jerry Lewis is gonna be
at this Friars Club roast I'm going to.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.953
Now I have an in to strike up
a conversation.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.325
You already have an in.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.400
You have the same first name.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.801
Jerry.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.105
Oh, that'll intrigue him.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.410
Well, it worked when I met
George Peppard last week.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.771
George Peppard
has been dead for years.

01:56.549 --> 02:00.212
Well, whoever he was,
he knew a lot about <i>The A-Team.</i>

02:01.020 --> 02:04.080
So you would choose your last meal
based on the method of execution?

02:04.257 --> 02:06.088
Right, if I was getting the chair...

02:06.259 --> 02:08.489
...I'd go for something hot and spicy,
you know?

02:08.661 --> 02:11.630
Thai, maybe Mexican.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.666
Lethal injection, feels like pasta.

02:14.834 --> 02:17.826
You know, it's painless,
I don't want anything too heavy.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.472
So why don't we
get together some time?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.733
Oh, sure. Why don't you give me
your number?

02:22.909 --> 02:24.809
I think it'd be better if I called you.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.970
Oh, okay. Maybe we could grab
some lunch sometime.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.208
-Do you work around here or...?
-No, not really.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.513
So is there anything
you can tell me about yourself?

02:34.954 --> 02:36.512
I think you're very beautiful.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.291
That'll do.

02:41.694 --> 02:42.718
What about Puddy?

02:42.896 --> 02:45.262
I haven't talked to him
in like three weeks.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.194
I think it might be over.

02:49.302 --> 02:52.066
-So, what's this guy about?
-I don't know.

02:52.238 --> 02:55.696
He wouldn't tell me his phone number,
where he worked.

02:55.942 --> 02:58.706
I'll bet he's in a relationship.

02:58.878 --> 03:01.847
Or he's a crime fighter
safeguarding his secret identity.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.941
Elaine, you could be dating
the Green Lantern.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.746
-Which one is he?
-Green suit, power ring.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.015
I don't care for jewelry on men.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.789
Hey, it happened again.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.622
Another robbery in the building.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.821
So you bought a cooler?

03:19.599 --> 03:22.762
No, it's a strongbox
to protect my irreplaceables.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.200
And what would those be?

03:25.371 --> 03:28.772
Some taxidermy that's been
in my family for generations.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.105
My Tony, my military discharge.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.575
You were in the Army?

03:34.647 --> 03:36.137
Briefly.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.109
Now, I gotta find a good place
to hide this key...

03:39.285 --> 03:42.880
...because if somebody finds this, they
hold the key to all my possessions.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.889
-Literally.
-Literally?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.118
What's that supposed to mean?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.991
-You mind if I hide this somewhere?
-No, go ahead.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.131
-A little privacy, huh?
-Oh, come on.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.967
Come on, this is a security issue.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.369
You wouldn't last
a day in the Army.

04:04.544 --> 04:08.640
-How long did you last?
-Well, that's classified.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.909
Hey, what if he's married?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.145
-Kramer?
-No, the Green Lantern.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.612
Okay.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.019
So you would date a married guy?

04:20.192 --> 04:21.660
That's so hacky.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.819
Well, I don't know. I may never marry.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.795
This might be the closest I get.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.592
You peeked.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.171
This is your hiding place?

04:35.508 --> 04:37.305
It was under a spoon.

04:40.346 --> 04:45.113
And so, for all these reasons,
we are officially broken up.

04:45.752 --> 04:49.347
Thank you and good night.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.355
No, George, we're not.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.356
But I proved it.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.494
I refuse to give up
on this relationship.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.460
It's like launching missiles
from a submarine.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.565
Both of us have to turn our keys.

05:02.568 --> 05:06.470
Well, then I am gonna have
to ask you to turn your key.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.736
I'm sorry, George. I can't do that.

05:09.676 --> 05:13.305
Turn your key, Maura.
Turn your key.

05:16.282 --> 05:19.080
So how is a guy like you
not involved?

05:19.252 --> 05:21.049
I might ask you the same thing.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.012
<i>That's true.
Maybe he's not married.</i>

05:24.390 --> 05:27.325
Oh, that is so sweet.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.859
<i>How long do I have to hold this?</i>

05:32.265 --> 05:34.893
-Oh, no.
-Who is it?

05:35.068 --> 05:36.831
No one. No one.

05:38.404 --> 05:40.702
Here, let me show you a shortcut.
Come on.

05:40.873 --> 05:44.934
<i>Married. That's it,
I'm chucking the flower.</i>

05:47.347 --> 05:51.078
Jerry. Jerry!

05:51.250 --> 05:53.275
Elaine, what are you doing
down there?

05:53.453 --> 05:55.284
You didn't hear me buzzing?

05:56.122 --> 05:57.749
Oh, I guess it's broken.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.914
Throw down your key.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.561
It's liable to bounce
and go into a sewer.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.094
I'll catch it.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.629
You'll chicken out
at the last second.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.063
Yeah, you're right.

06:10.136 --> 06:13.765
Well, will you at least keep me
company until somebody comes out?

06:14.307 --> 06:15.399
All right.

06:19.846 --> 06:22.576
Hey, you know what's weird?

06:22.749 --> 06:25.912
I used to be able to have
a huge meal and go right to sleep.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.780
I can't anymore.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.444
Nodding off!

06:30.990 --> 06:34.790
Well, I was right. He's an adulterer.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.089
And he's cheating on his wife
with me.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.498
We haven't done anything yet.

06:43.202 --> 06:47.104
I'm hungry.
Can you throw something down?

06:47.273 --> 06:51.869
All right. Here.
I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.913
It went in the sewer.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.814
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

07:05.925 --> 07:09.691
You jammed your key in here.
You shorted out my intercom.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.160
You just had to go looking for it,
didn't you?

07:12.331 --> 07:14.322
See, you hate it that I have
a little secret.

07:14.500 --> 07:18.061
Anything I do,
you gotta know all about it.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.205
You're so obsessed with me.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.438
I'm gonna go let Elaine in.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.200
What are you doing with her?

07:27.914 --> 07:31.008
-Kramer.
-Security issue.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.542
-Oh, hey, you got in.
-Yeah.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.620
-Flirted with the menu guy. Here.
-Oh, thanks.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.280
That wasn't me.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.183
So he's definitely married, huh?

07:43.396 --> 07:46.331
Boy, I would loved to have been there
when you told him off.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.028
Oh, come on.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.536
Well, he could be a superhero.
You should have seen him run.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.834
Okay.

07:57.376 --> 08:00.106
All right, Jerry. Let's see
if you can get it in your head...

08:00.279 --> 08:04.909
...that this is not an Easter egg hunt
for your childish amusement.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.711
Jerry.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.250
George, the buzzer's broken.
I'll come down.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:21.234 --> 08:22.724
I believe this belongs to you.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.573
Where did you get that?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.039
I bought it.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.520
-Thanks.
-I'm sorry.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.552
-I don't know you.
-What?

08:43.722 --> 08:47.420
There's have been some robberies
in the building. I can't let you in.

08:47.593 --> 08:51.256
But I live here. I ran out to buy some
bird seed and I forgot my key.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.591
Sounds like a scam.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.767
I'm very sorry.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.634
So I broke up with Maura.
It's done. I'm out.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.605
Great.
You're lonely and miserable again.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.142
It feels right.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.274
Is that guy still there?

09:09.448 --> 09:12.747
-He's staring at us.
-Don't look at him.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.615
We don't hear that.

09:17.657 --> 09:21.058
-Want a bite?
-No, I don't.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.561
<i>That ginger ale at the coffee shop is
just Coke and Sprite mixed together.</i>

09:29.735 --> 09:31.327
<i>How can I prove it?</i>

09:31.504 --> 09:34.200
<i>Damn it, I can't. Damn it.</i>

09:40.646 --> 09:42.375
Hi, honey.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.783
What? Maura,
what are you doing here?

09:46.953 --> 09:49.751
I ended this relationship twice.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.982
George, you didn't mean that.
That was just a fight.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.955
Why does it always seem like I'm
the only one working at this breakup?

09:59.131 --> 10:01.156
George, I listened
to your arguments...

10:01.334 --> 10:04.531
...and they were rambling and flimsy.
I'm not convinced.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.929
Come on, get dressed
and let's get some dinner.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.437
All right.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.546
Mr. Apple, you have a brown spot.

10:23.589 --> 10:26.023
So this is your little love nest?

10:26.959 --> 10:29.359
It's nothing special,
just a little place I keep.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.356
Should I light a fire?

10:33.532 --> 10:36.000
That sounds romantic.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.999
I'm having a little problem
with the heat.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.502
I got some cardboard out here.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.641
<i>This is wrong. I should go.</i>

10:45.645 --> 10:48.512
-Can you get that, please?
-Oh, sure.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.478
Where's Glenn?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.622
You're the woman from the street,
and I am so sorry.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.815
You know, I'm not really
a homewrecker.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.393
I thought he was a superhero.
I swear.

11:03.562 --> 11:06.725
Lady, I'm not his wife.
I'm his welfare caseworker.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.366
Is he home?

11:08.534 --> 11:11.230
-This is his home?
-Yes.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.739
-So he's....
-Poor.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.369
I think this will burn.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.853
-So you do live here.
-Yeah.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.137
-You live on this floor?
-Yeah.

11:52.678 --> 11:57.138
-So you live right there.
-Yeah.

11:57.616 --> 11:58.605
So I guess I'll--

12:07.326 --> 12:10.762
He wouldn't give me his number,
because he doesn't have a phone.

12:10.930 --> 12:15.299
He's not married. He's poor.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.498
Is he wretchedly poor?

12:18.738 --> 12:22.071
Does he wear one of those barrels
with the straps?

12:24.110 --> 12:27.511
He probably busted it up
and burned it for heat.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.482
So when are you giving Boxcar Willie
his walking papers?

12:31.650 --> 12:35.484
How can I end it over money?
I feel bad.

12:35.654 --> 12:36.951
Well, let's think.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.455
Have you dealt with the poor
in any other situation?

12:39.625 --> 12:41.456
Yes. There was this homeless guy...

12:41.627 --> 12:43.959
...who used to urinate
on our garbage cans.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.995
Good. How did you handle that?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.292
We gave him a few bucks.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.162
He goes in the alley
across the street.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.930
Same situation.
Pay him off and you're clean.

12:53.105 --> 12:57.940
Well, I am not paying Glenn off
to get out of this relationship.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.304
What am I supposed to do?

12:59.478 --> 13:02.743
Just walk into his hovel
and hand him--

13:02.915 --> 13:05.349
Well, how much do you think
it would be?

13:06.018 --> 13:08.350
-Hey.
-Hey, where have you been?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.148
Seeing Maura.

13:10.322 --> 13:14.486
Apparently, I was unable to break up
beyond a reasonable doubt.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.725
If only he could have been
cheating on his wife.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.024
You know, things would have been
so much simpler.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.667
-Who's this? Blue Arrow?
-Green Lantern.

13:22.835 --> 13:26.168
We found out his superpower
was lack of money.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.796
-All right.
-He's invulnerable to creditors.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.705
-We get it.
-He's the Got-No-Green Lantern.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.440
Thank you.

13:34.613 --> 13:38.208
Hey, Elaine.
Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.876
Well crafted.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.786
Hey, maybe this cheating thing
is what I could use to ditch Maura.

13:44.957 --> 13:49.519
-Tell Maura you're having an affair.
-She's like a district attorney.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.687
If it's not the truth,
I'll break under the cross.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.197
I actually have to do it.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.428
Could you move over there?

14:03.475 --> 14:06.842
Hey, there's this secretary at work
that always had a crush on me.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.775
How come you never
pursued her before?

14:09.381 --> 14:10.848
She's too tan.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.917
It's the middle of the winter,
she's like a carrot.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.088
-Did I leave my glasses?
-He can wipe out his account...

14:17.256 --> 14:19.554
-...in a single bounce.
-Keep them.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.468
There's a giant parrot
in the hallway.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.035
-It's Phil's.
-Who?

14:32.204 --> 14:34.536
Our neighbor
that you turned against.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.599
I told him it would be fine...

14:37.776 --> 14:40.370
...if he wanted to let it stretch its wings
in the hallway.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.036
What did you tell him that for?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.512
Since you've been playing
God with the front door...

14:44.683 --> 14:47.117
...I've been trying
to smooth things out, Jerry.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.278
-I was just hanging out at his place.
-Really? What's it like?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.549
Is it nicer?
Where does he have the couch?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.057
Well, I don't know,
but the key problem is solved.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.888
-I hid it at Phil's.
-He let you?

14:57.062 --> 15:00.498
No, he doesn't know.
See, I hid it without telling him.

15:00.666 --> 15:05.262
So Phil won't be compulsively
looking for it like some people.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.305
You.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.949
So you say you've been
in the city all winter?

15:24.123 --> 15:27.286
I was in Maine for a couple days.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.320
Well...

15:30.996 --> 15:33.260
...here we are.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.596
George, I've always fantasized about
jumping into bed with you.

15:40.272 --> 15:45.869
But I don't wanna spoil things
by sleeping with you too soon.

15:46.045 --> 15:49.537
Are you sure? Because it could
really help me out of a jam.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.608
I wanna build something with you,
George.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.548
Oh, not more building.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.685
And I won't take no for an answer.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.450
-No?
-No.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.287
All right.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.163
What are we doing
in this alley, anyway?

16:11.337 --> 16:12.565
It's a surprise.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.806
-What are you doing? What is that?
-It's a bag of doughnuts.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.472
-It's garbage.
-No, no.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.548
When they make the new ones,
the old ones come out right here.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.685
All right, that's it.

16:26.852 --> 16:29.514
-How do you spell your last name?
-It's a bear claw.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.883
You have no idea how rare this is.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.048
I'll make it out to cash.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.093
How about 200 bucks? Two-fifty?

16:38.364 --> 16:40.025
Make it 300.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.860
You know, Elaine...

16:42.368 --> 16:46.464
...you're the bear claw
in the garbage bag of my life.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.933
Oh, Glenn.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.019
-Hi, is Phil here?
-Yeah, I'm here.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.386
Phil. Hi.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.582
I know we got off to kind
of a bad start, but your bird...

17:07.760 --> 17:12.128
...which is lovely, by the way,
made a mess on my door.

17:12.564 --> 17:13.553
And?

17:13.732 --> 17:16.565
I thought maybe you'd clean it up
or your maid there.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.032
That's my wife.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.369
All right, I think we're done here.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.207
So you're in a relationship
with a woman you don't like...

17:31.383 --> 17:34.477
...and you're having an affair
with a woman that won't have sex.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.119
This isn't going well.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.854
I cannot find
my Jerry Lewis cufflinks.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.549
Without them, I have no in.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.686
You don't need the cufflinks.
You have the same name.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.496
Jerry.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.999
Where are you going? Help me look.

17:52.171 --> 17:55.004
It's a big night.
I'm ice-skating with one...

17:55.174 --> 17:59.338
...and going to a staged reading
of <i>Godspell</i> with the other.

17:59.945 --> 18:03.073
-Which is with who?
-It doesn't matter.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.977
Yeah, you clean up nice.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.179
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.017
Yeah. See, I knew you
would lose them.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.753
That's why I took them out of your
drawer and put them in my strongbox.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.590
You're a lifesaver.
Would you get them, please?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.426
We'll stop by Phil's,
pick up the key.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.597
Hey, what's going on?

18:27.172 --> 18:28.833
Fredo is dead.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.999
That strange Portuguese guy
that lives next to the incinerator?

18:32.177 --> 18:36.113
No, my bird. We just got back
from the pet cemetery.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.579
Oh, Phil.

18:39.351 --> 18:43.151
Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.

18:43.322 --> 18:44.880
Oh, I'll bet you are.

18:45.057 --> 18:49.289
They told us he was poisoned.
Something in his food.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.361
But I didn't--

18:51.930 --> 18:54.125
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.561
And who buries a bird?

18:55.734 --> 18:57.759
Yeah, just give it
to the Portuguese guy...

18:57.936 --> 19:00.461
...and he puts it in the incinerator.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.603
Just get the key
and let's get out of here.

19:03.775 --> 19:07.006
You know, it's a funny thing
about that bird dying.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.204
I hid the key in Fredo's food dish.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.045
That's a weird coincidence.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.679
-Kramer.
-What?

19:13.852 --> 19:15.319
You killed Fredo.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.657
Fredo was weak and stupid.
He shouldn't have eaten that key.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.292
Kramer, I need those cufflinks...

19:21.460 --> 19:23.985
...but now they're in the box
and the key is in the bird.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.960
What are we gonna do?

19:26.131 --> 19:27.996
You just answered
your own question.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.827
-Oh, no.
-I'll get the shovel.

19:34.606 --> 19:39.339
The actor that played Jesus
made some odd choices.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.368
What?

19:42.147 --> 19:44.672
I mean, I had fun ice-skating.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.757
-George.
-Maura.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.622
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

19:56.795 --> 19:58.194
You told me to meet you here.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.756
I'm caught in my own web of lies.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.870
-I'm Maura.
-I'm Loretta. You wanna join us?

20:06.038 --> 20:08.370
This is all blowing up in my face.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.032
My serious girlfriend
and my torrid love affair...

20:12.211 --> 20:13.906
...have accidentally crossed paths.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.946
I have ruined three lives.

20:17.382 --> 20:22.479
Well, I understand if you never wanna
see me again. So--

20:22.654 --> 20:25.179
What we have is too important.
We can work through this.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.587
So can we.

20:28.493 --> 20:29.721
What?

20:30.729 --> 20:33.493
-So this is still not over?
-No.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.966
-You?
-No.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.394
All right.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.712
Elaine, oh, wow. A TV, a stereo.

20:49.881 --> 20:53.146
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood
so you won't have to burn them.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.917
Oh, my God, Alison.
You're home early.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.252
-Who is this?
-His wife.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.756
You're poor and married.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.187
Looks like it.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.594
Who the hell are you?

21:08.767 --> 21:12.294
I guess I'm Lois Loan.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.265
I can't believe we're grave robbers.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.637
"Man's best friend."

21:19.811 --> 21:22.177
Jerry, I want something like that
on my tombstone.

21:23.815 --> 21:24.975
Oh, my God, here he is.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.015
I don't wanna dig him up.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.447
All right, then you're the one
getting the key out of him.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.217
I'll dig.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.120
Listen, I heard that Lassie
number three's buried here.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.492
I'm gonna go check it out.

21:49.341 --> 21:52.674
Well, that was easy.

21:52.844 --> 21:58.043
All right, honey, one last look, then
you have to let Fredo rest in peace.

21:59.851 --> 22:03.753
Hey, Kramer. I dug Fredo out.
Now let's cut him open.

22:03.922 --> 22:06.356
Oh, my God.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.186
Hey, neighbor.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.098
All right.

22:21.907 --> 22:25.468
I'm gonna try giving them $55 each.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.102
What do you think?

22:29.281 --> 22:32.444
Give me 40.
You'll never see me again.

22:36.254 --> 22:39.519
So, what are you gonna do? Are you
gonna live here, or move out or what?

22:39.991 --> 22:43.017
I'll just take the fire escape
to get in and out of the building.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.398
So, what's in the cooler?

22:52.137 --> 22:55.436
Well, will you look at that.
I guess I forgot to lock it.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.268
You mean, it was open?

23:00.445 --> 23:03.812
We desecrated a pet cemetery
for nothing?

23:03.982 --> 23:06.780
Well, this is one for the books,
huh, Jerry?

23:10.255 --> 23:12.382
<i>Really one for the books.</i>
