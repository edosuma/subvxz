00:02.093 --> 00:05.130
Hey, hey, hey, y'all ready
to hit the City of Sisterly Love?

00:05.293 --> 00:07.090
Don't you mean "Brotherly Love"?

00:07.293 --> 00:09.648
Take my word on this one, Carlton.

00:10.893 --> 00:13.612
It doesn't matter
how you sugar coat it, Will...

00:13.773 --> 00:17.607
...this vacation
has all the earmarks of stinking.

00:17.773 --> 00:20.128
- Well, I'm looking forward to it.
- Yeah, me too.

00:20.293 --> 00:23.444
Come on, Carlton.
This is Philadelphia in the springtime.

00:23.613 --> 00:26.923
Man, there's people all over the place.
There's guys playing stickball.

00:27.093 --> 00:31.405
- Girls in the street playing double dutch.
- No country club reciprocity.

00:32.493 --> 00:35.849
Geoffrey, we'll be gone for about
four or five days. You know what to do.

00:36.013 --> 00:38.811
Don't worry, sir,
the house is in excellent hands.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.408
Do we have to go?

00:41.573 --> 00:45.088
Carlton, your Aunt Vy is dying to show us
how she's redecorated her home.

00:45.293 --> 00:48.410
- God forbid she should send a picture.
- Philip.

00:48.573 --> 00:50.006
Come on, kids, let's go.

00:50.173 --> 00:53.449
Oh, all right, let's get it over with.

00:53.613 --> 00:56.207
Carlton, would you cool out
a little bit, man.

00:56.373 --> 00:59.570
What, just because you're not going
to some fancy resort somewhere...

00:59.733 --> 01:01.610
...that means you can't have
a good time?

01:01.773 --> 01:04.685
It is a damn shame when people
are spoiled by money.

01:08.053 --> 01:11.170
G, put some butter on that,
bring that out to me in the car.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

02:31.133 --> 02:34.011
Come on, y'all come right on in.
Make yourself at home.

02:34.173 --> 02:37.165
Oh, there it is, y'all.
Hey, check it out.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.403
My TV chair.

02:40.573 --> 02:44.691
I spent 10 years customizing
this thing to my boogie.

02:45.573 --> 02:47.165
Now, I don't want none of y'all...

02:47.333 --> 02:49.972
...sitting in it and stretching out
my sweet spot.

02:52.053 --> 02:54.203
Y'all know who you are.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.650
Don't make me kill you
in your mother's home.

02:58.413 --> 03:00.643
I'm going to check out my bedroom.

03:01.253 --> 03:03.050
Well, what do you guys think?

03:03.213 --> 03:06.205
Vy, you have really perked
this place up.

03:06.373 --> 03:08.091
Hasn't she, Hilary?

03:08.773 --> 03:10.331
Yeah.

03:10.493 --> 03:12.290
I mean it's so...

03:13.333 --> 03:14.732
...poor.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.325
Hey, my bedroom
is exactly how I left it.

03:19.493 --> 03:21.529
I even found
my What's Happening! Home game.

03:21.693 --> 03:23.649
What's Happening!
Or What's Happening Now?

03:25.413 --> 03:27.404
What's Happening!

03:27.613 --> 03:30.127
Neato! I get to be Rerun.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.683
Listen, go find yourself a beret,
and I'm gonna go get my stuff unpacked.

03:33.893 --> 03:35.121
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

03:35.293 --> 03:38.205
I'm putting both of you right out here
on the convertible couch.

03:38.373 --> 03:40.523
And Ashley and Hilary
will be with me.

03:40.693 --> 03:43.332
Philip and Vivian will have your room.

03:43.493 --> 03:46.053
Hey, Mom, listen,
you should probably make sure...

03:46.213 --> 03:48.568
...that Uncle Phil sleeps
on the bottom bunk.

03:48.733 --> 03:52.248
Because if he get up on the top bunk...
Well, you know gravity ain't no joke.

03:52.413 --> 03:55.371
You know what I'm saying?
He could end up in China.

03:56.253 --> 03:58.721
You know, Vy,
we don't wanna be any trouble.

03:58.893 --> 04:02.442
Why don't we just make reservations
at a hotel and just get out of your hair.

04:02.613 --> 04:04.968
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- No, no, no.

04:05.173 --> 04:07.926
- There is plenty of room right here.
- Yep, yep.

04:08.093 --> 04:10.687
And I'll take it as a personal insult
if you guys leave.

04:10.853 --> 04:13.526
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

04:13.933 --> 04:15.525
How about if just I left?

04:17.853 --> 04:20.572
That's what I get
for being considerate.

04:20.813 --> 04:24.772
Vy, we'd be happy
to stay here with you. All of us.

04:24.933 --> 04:30.007
Good, but don't bother unpacking now,
because we got to get to the ballpark.

04:30.173 --> 04:32.892
Teddy Pendergrass
is singing the national anthem.

04:33.053 --> 04:35.772
Oh, yeah, Phillies in the house!

04:35.933 --> 04:38.686
You know, Vy,
we're all a little jet-lagged.

04:40.253 --> 04:41.925
Well, I know Will wants to go.

04:42.093 --> 04:44.368
Yeah, take the sub
right to Broad and Patterson.

04:44.533 --> 04:46.285
- You know it.
- Hey, I'll tell you what.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.762
I'll race you to the station.
Loser pays the fare.

04:48.933 --> 04:52.130
You're on. But wait a minute.
Tie your shoes first.

04:53.253 --> 04:56.802
You're cheating. You're cheating.
My mama cheating.

04:56.973 --> 04:58.725
Come here!

04:59.253 --> 05:01.562
How come we never had
that much fun?

05:01.733 --> 05:03.405
I don't know.

05:03.613 --> 05:05.808
What's on TV?

05:06.133 --> 05:08.693
God, I wish I was home.

05:08.853 --> 05:11.606
Right about now, I bet Geoffrey
is turning back my covers...

05:11.813 --> 05:13.804
...and putting a little mint
on my pillow.

05:51.373 --> 05:53.568
Hey, program!

05:53.773 --> 05:56.446
Hey, program!

05:57.133 --> 05:59.886
Here we go, man.
How you doing, man?

06:00.053 --> 06:02.521
Here you go. Thanks.

06:18.653 --> 06:21.690
Here it is, y'all,
best hoagie spot in the whole city.

06:21.853 --> 06:24.970
They got the kind of food here
that sticks to your ribs.

06:26.893 --> 06:28.611
And your feet.

06:29.773 --> 06:32.890
What do you have to tip
the maitre d' to get a good stool?

06:37.133 --> 06:40.603
Unless you're here to stick up
the joint, sit down and eat.

06:40.773 --> 06:43.970
Take a tip, buddy, you won't get
anywhere in the service industry...

06:44.133 --> 06:46.363
...treating customers like that.

06:46.533 --> 06:49.730
Why don't you take your Bing Crosby butt
over to the golden arches...

06:49.893 --> 06:52.646
...and lie down
in front of a drive-through window.

06:54.813 --> 06:56.724
Ain't he great?

06:57.093 --> 06:59.129
Hey, dude,
give me four cheese steaks, man.

06:59.493 --> 07:02.007
Four Joe Frazier's in cheese trunks.

07:02.173 --> 07:05.290
- Joe Frazier?
- Yeah, it means "big beef."

07:05.453 --> 07:07.569
Duke names all the sandwiches
after people.

07:07.733 --> 07:11.521
- Give me one with mushrooms, dude.
- Wrap one in fungus.

07:16.853 --> 07:21.324
I don't believe it. This is the only song
this jukebox ever played.

07:21.533 --> 07:24.570
We used to sing to this all the time.

07:40.973 --> 07:43.282
Yo, Dumbo, pick up.

07:43.653 --> 07:47.532
Y'all gonna love these drawers.
Hey, thanks a lot, Duke.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.482
I've been dying for one of these.

07:50.653 --> 07:52.609
My God, these are a mess.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.525
They're filled with grease.

07:55.653 --> 07:57.769
Yeah, it's great, ain't it?

07:58.173 --> 08:02.883
Hey, Will, is that the legendary park
where you used to play basketball?

08:03.053 --> 08:04.486
Oh, yeah, it sure is.

08:04.653 --> 08:09.124
You call that pathetic strip
of graffiti-littered concrete legendary?

08:10.733 --> 08:12.325
Can we go there after we eat?

08:14.133 --> 08:17.284
No. No, no, I don't think so.

08:19.653 --> 08:23.566
Wow, it's Dick Clark.
Hey, I grew up watching you.

08:23.733 --> 08:26.531
- Thank you, thank you.
- How come I got older, but you didn't?

08:26.733 --> 08:28.485
Duke's sandwiches,
a fountain of youth.

08:28.653 --> 08:30.883
Duke, give me a chicken sandwich to go,
will you?

08:31.053 --> 08:34.250
Sure thing, Mr. Clark. One Will Smith.

08:34.413 --> 08:35.607
Will Smith?

08:35.813 --> 08:37.530
Yeah, we named it after this guy...

08:37.693 --> 08:39.967
...who got into a little scrape
across the street.

08:40.133 --> 08:44.046
Only instead of fighting, he ran
clear across the country to California.

08:44.212 --> 08:47.285
He was a chicken to go.

08:48.733 --> 08:52.567
What a coincidence,
his name is Will Smith.

08:53.173 --> 08:55.528
You're kidding... Wait a second.

08:55.693 --> 08:56.921
Yeah, a little taller.

08:57.093 --> 09:00.130
The ears were a little bigger,
but it is you!

09:00.293 --> 09:02.090
My man!

09:02.253 --> 09:04.847
All right!

09:05.613 --> 09:09.686
Listen, it's me,
but I didn't exactly run.

09:09.853 --> 09:13.243
Hey, look. Hey, Mr. Clark,
we got another celebrity over here.

09:13.453 --> 09:17.332
Say hello to Chicken Will.
Come on, my man, strut your stuff.

09:17.493 --> 09:20.883
Hey, it's got a good beat,
and you can run to it.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.161
Not you too, Dick.

09:28.373 --> 09:30.364
Hey, there he goes,
he's running again.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.569
Hey! Hey, where you going?

09:32.733 --> 09:35.691
California's the other way!

09:44.533 --> 09:46.091
Okay, okay.

09:53.453 --> 09:56.729
Yeah! If it isn't the Fresh Prince!

10:02.573 --> 10:04.928
Man, what y'all been into?

10:05.093 --> 10:06.970
Nothing, man,
just working them 40 hours.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.601
Yo, man, we thought
you was living phat in California?

10:10.133 --> 10:13.011
Yeah, I was. And I would
have stayed there if I'd have known...

10:13.173 --> 10:15.289
...I was getting played
like a clown back here.

10:15.453 --> 10:18.206
That's not true. Everybody just
wanna know where you been.

10:18.373 --> 10:21.524
Gladys, look, that's Vy's boy, Will.

10:22.293 --> 10:24.602
- Hey, Will.
- How you doing?

10:33.373 --> 10:35.284
- That's funny?
- I ain't laughing.

10:35.453 --> 10:37.330
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

10:37.493 --> 10:41.168
I thought y'all was my boys. Why you
ain't telling my rep was getting sliced up.

10:41.373 --> 10:44.649
Yo, we are your boys, man.
We figured you was never coming back.

10:44.813 --> 10:47.885
But every time somebody
tried to diss you, we step to them.

10:48.053 --> 10:50.362
We got beat up plenty of times
protecting your rep.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.569
- Right.
- Word.

10:52.773 --> 10:54.604
- Y'all did?
- Yeah, man.

10:54.773 --> 10:57.128
We don't run away from our fights.

10:57.293 --> 11:00.251
- We can't. All our relatives live here.
- Right.

11:00.413 --> 11:02.369
All right, you hooligans, disperse.

11:02.533 --> 11:06.321
Stop taunting my cousin just
because he ran away from a fight.

11:07.493 --> 11:11.008
Look, stumpy, I did not run.

11:11.173 --> 11:15.769
I just went to visit y'all
for four years.

11:18.253 --> 11:22.132
Look, this is Chill,
Soup, Steve, Word.

11:22.293 --> 11:24.284
What's up, stumpy?

11:30.053 --> 11:32.613
Why won't you go upstairs
if you gotta use the bathroom.

11:32.773 --> 11:36.129
Hey, mister, there's nothing worse
than dirty Dockers.

11:36.533 --> 11:39.252
Look, squash that.
What am I supposed to do about my rep?

11:39.413 --> 11:41.643
Yo, you got to stand up
to Omar Boulware, man.

11:41.853 --> 11:44.845
- Word.
- Who's Omar Boulware?

11:45.053 --> 11:46.771
Some guy Will wouldn't fight.

11:47.213 --> 11:51.092
The dude that be spinning me
over his head in the opening credits.

11:52.973 --> 11:56.682
Man, that is one mean brother, man.

11:56.853 --> 11:59.083
Yo, remember in junior high...

11:59.253 --> 12:02.404
...when he stole the principal's car
just to run him over?

12:03.453 --> 12:05.728
Yo, where he be hanging at, man?

12:05.893 --> 12:07.611
Yo, he down around
Shepherd Park, man.

12:07.813 --> 12:10.850
You're not thinking
of fighting this ruffian, are you?

12:11.013 --> 12:12.446
Look, that's the only way, man.

12:12.613 --> 12:13.841
Word.

12:14.053 --> 12:15.532
Yo, Will, we got your back, man.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.048
- He can't take all of us.
- Straight up.

12:18.253 --> 12:20.050
That's right.

12:20.853 --> 12:22.844
I've been reading.

12:23.413 --> 12:25.927
I appreciate y'all
having my back and everything...

12:26.093 --> 12:28.448
...but, you know,
I gotta take care of this myself.

12:28.613 --> 12:30.205
All right.

12:30.373 --> 12:32.682
Hey, Carlton, come here, man.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.452
Listen, I need your help, man.

12:34.613 --> 12:37.252
I gotta go into training.
I'm gonna kick Omar's butt.

12:37.453 --> 12:39.648
- Come on.
- I thought you said this is one-on-one.

12:39.853 --> 12:43.323
- What do you need me for?
- Well, if I win, I need a witness.

12:43.493 --> 12:46.451
If I lose, you're my blood type.
Come on.

12:46.613 --> 12:48.092
- Keep cool.
- All right, man.

14:10.453 --> 14:13.445
Gee, this playground makes
the other one look like Club Med.

14:13.613 --> 14:17.731
- Come on, what are you trying to prove?
- You don't understand about reputations.

14:17.893 --> 14:21.010
I mean, they can follow you around
like a bad smell.

14:23.373 --> 14:25.523
Maybe you do understand.

14:25.693 --> 14:27.012
I do know one thing, Will...

14:27.173 --> 14:31.246
...a bad smell isn't worth
a mouthful of bloody Chicklets.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.005
Let me explain something to you...

14:33.173 --> 14:36.085
...I'm not some skinny little
14-year-old kid no more.

14:36.253 --> 14:38.323
If anybody's gonna be bleeding,
it's gonna be...

14:38.493 --> 14:41.451
...that big, pumpkin-head Omar.

14:41.653 --> 14:44.406
- Will...
- Carlton, I have the advantage.

14:44.573 --> 14:47.007
Not only is he big and dumb,
he's slow.

14:47.173 --> 14:48.447
- Will...
- Carlton...

14:48.613 --> 14:51.969
...it's like his brain is so tiny,
if he shake his big head like this...

14:52.133 --> 14:54.522
...it'd sound like a BB in a canteen.

14:55.253 --> 14:57.847
Does he wear a black sweatshirt?

14:58.013 --> 15:01.005
How am I supposed to remember
if he wears a black sweatshirt?

15:01.453 --> 15:03.284
Turn around.

15:05.053 --> 15:07.521
Hey, man.

15:07.693 --> 15:11.208
Yo, man, we got this court.

15:13.493 --> 15:16.769
Is that so?
You don't remember who I am, do you?

15:16.933 --> 15:20.005
I don't care who you are.
I said we got this court.

15:23.773 --> 15:26.412
You funny.
Listen, we ain't scared of you, man.

15:26.613 --> 15:28.968
Me and Carlton can take you.

15:30.213 --> 15:31.726
You and who?

15:31.893 --> 15:33.770
Carlton. Ain't that right...?

15:36.413 --> 15:38.005
Carlton?

15:41.093 --> 15:44.608
Geoffrey, I will never live down
the shame of a domestic vacation.

15:44.773 --> 15:47.492
Look, go to Rodeo Drive,
buy a bunch of stuff...

15:47.653 --> 15:49.644
...send it to someone you know
in England...

15:49.813 --> 15:52.611
...and have him mail it
to all my friends.

15:55.933 --> 16:00.085
Where have you two been?
I sent you out of here four hours ago.

16:00.253 --> 16:02.084
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

16:02.293 --> 16:05.524
We went for a long walk.
I love this city.

16:05.693 --> 16:07.843
Tell her about that scrapple place.

16:08.013 --> 16:09.446
You ate scrapple?

16:09.613 --> 16:13.162
That's made from the part of the pig
that's not good enough to go in sausage.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.723
- But it's good enough to go in Philip.
- Oh, baby.

16:18.013 --> 16:22.529
Yeah, well, this is all very nice,
but where are my groceries?

16:22.973 --> 16:25.533
I knew we forgot something.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.002
I don't know,
I'm supposed to be in England.

16:28.173 --> 16:31.131
Get some English muffins.

16:31.333 --> 16:34.405
Is that Geoffrey?
Let me talk to him.

16:34.933 --> 16:38.528
Geoffrey, I can't find my gold
silk bathrobe, did you pack it?

16:39.293 --> 16:42.205
Did I forget to pack that?

16:42.373 --> 16:46.332
I'll keep an eye out for it, sir.
I'm sure it will turn up.

16:46.533 --> 16:49.923
Enjoy the rest of your vacation.

16:50.133 --> 16:51.851
Goodbye.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.765
There is room for one more.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.046
Let me tell you something, man.

17:09.213 --> 17:13.252
You have kicked me
off of this court for the last time.

17:13.653 --> 17:16.041
I don't remember kicking you off
the first time.

17:16.573 --> 17:19.371
- You really don't remember me, huh?
- No.

17:21.053 --> 17:23.169
Okay, okay, okay.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.528
Hey, can I see that ball, brother?

17:26.012 --> 17:28.321
How about a little hint?

17:30.613 --> 17:31.841
Oh, I remember you.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.364
But, hey, man,
I'm not like that anymore.

17:34.573 --> 17:36.165
Oh, really.

17:36.373 --> 17:39.012
You look like the same
bald-headed punk to me.

17:39.413 --> 17:41.881
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

17:42.053 --> 17:44.169
You're the chicken sandwich guy.

17:47.253 --> 17:49.892
I am not a chicken!

17:50.053 --> 17:52.931
My mama made me move, man.
My mama made me move.

17:53.093 --> 17:55.049
I would never leave Philly!
I love it here.

17:55.213 --> 17:57.602
So do I.
That's why I'm giving back to it.

17:57.773 --> 17:59.650
I stayed to help the kids in the area...

17:59.813 --> 18:02.850
...so that they wouldn't make
the same mistakes I did.

18:03.013 --> 18:07.052
You sound like an after-school special,
or something.

18:07.733 --> 18:10.122
But that ain't gonna do nothing
for my rep.

18:10.293 --> 18:13.729
Let's go right now,
and I ain't taking no for an answer.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.484
You have no choice. Let's go.

18:19.053 --> 18:23.410
Okay, well, you're so stupid,
you thought a quarterback was a refund.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.607
How about that?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.849
You so ugly, when you was born...

18:28.013 --> 18:30.447
...the doctor just slapped
both your parents.

18:30.613 --> 18:33.286
And your mom... Oh, my goodness!

18:33.453 --> 18:37.048
She is like a doorknob,
everybody gets a turn!

18:40.973 --> 18:43.567
I guess the mom's the red button.

18:43.853 --> 18:47.289
Okay, come on, let's go.
Let's go.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.161
Look here, man...

18:51.333 --> 18:55.611
...I know what you're trying to do,
but I am not gonna hit you.

18:58.693 --> 19:01.082
Then I'm gonna tell everybody
you're a punk, then.

19:01.253 --> 19:03.483
- Be my guest.
- What about your rep?

19:03.653 --> 19:06.804
Look, you see those guys over there?

19:07.613 --> 19:09.490
That's my rep.

19:10.053 --> 19:12.283
Brother, you need to grow up.

19:24.013 --> 19:25.446
Will.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.328
Let me know when you need me.

19:31.933 --> 19:34.163
- Thank you for a lovely time.
- You're welcome.

19:34.333 --> 19:38.645
Will, the plane leaves in an hour.
Come on, hurry it up.

19:40.533 --> 19:43.650
Oh, baby,
it was so good having you.

19:43.813 --> 19:46.281
And here.
Here's the Phillies schedule.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.968
Maybe you can come back
when they make it to the World Series.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.166
I can't do it.

19:54.373 --> 19:56.284
No need to get melodramatic, Will.

19:56.453 --> 19:59.172
Just watch it on TV
with the rest of us.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.206
I'm talking about going back to Bel-Air.

20:02.373 --> 20:04.967
I ain't ready to leave yet, y'all.
I'm still having fun.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.328
Fun? You've been ostracized
since you got here.

20:07.493 --> 20:09.882
What you talking about?
That Chicken Will thing?

20:10.053 --> 20:12.806
That ain't nothing.
Guys be tripping like that all the time.

20:12.973 --> 20:15.328
You mean I was in a garbage can
for nothing?

20:15.493 --> 20:17.563
When were you in a garbage can?

20:17.733 --> 20:19.405
Look, I'm just saying, you know...

20:19.573 --> 20:23.486
...I didn't realize how much
I miss just sitting out on the stoop.

20:23.653 --> 20:25.848
Look, when we get back,
Dad will buy us a stoop.

20:26.013 --> 20:27.605
Come on,
we're gonna miss the plane.

20:27.773 --> 20:30.970
Yeah, I don't wanna spend
another minute in this sardine can.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.363
Thanks for everything, Aunt Vy.

20:36.613 --> 20:38.968
Will, I'll tell you what...

20:39.133 --> 20:42.887
...you stay for another week or so, then
you come home when you're ready, okay?

20:43.053 --> 20:45.203
- All right.
- Thanks a lot, Vy. It was wonderful.

20:45.373 --> 20:47.603
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

20:47.773 --> 20:50.048
- Call me when you get home.
- I will.

20:50.213 --> 20:53.649
- Okay, take care.
- All right, bye, Hillary. Bye, Ashley.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.567
Well, isn't this a surprise?

20:56.733 --> 21:01.523
- Just me and you, just like old times.
- That's right.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.763
Now, go clean up your room.

21:03.973 --> 21:05.531
Go on.

21:10.173 --> 21:12.607
- What time is Will's plane coming in?
- I don't know.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.287
He was supposed to call
with his flight arrangements...

21:15.453 --> 21:17.683
...but he gets so wrapped up
in his own life...

21:17.853 --> 21:21.004
...that he cannot take the time
to be a little bit responsible.

21:21.173 --> 21:23.129
That must be him now.

21:25.093 --> 21:27.402
- Hello?
- Hey, Uncle Phil.

21:27.573 --> 21:29.450
Will, are you at the airport?

21:29.613 --> 21:32.810
No, I'm at home.

21:32.973 --> 21:35.487
Well, what happened?
You miss your flight?

21:36.093 --> 21:37.492
Sort of.

21:37.653 --> 21:39.928
Well, when you coming back, then?

21:41.493 --> 21:42.721
I'm not.
