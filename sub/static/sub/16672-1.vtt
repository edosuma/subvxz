what are you doing in my room?

08:01.649 --> 08:03.551
Putting clothes on.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.586
Girl, you've been trying
clothes on all day long.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.888
Okay, Mom, what do you think?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.890
- I think you look beautiful.
- And my hair?

08:09.923 --> 08:13.694
- Your hair?
- You like my hair?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.195
Mom.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.064
It's beautiful, darling.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.634
- Careful, you're gonna mess it up.
- Okay.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.202
Is Kool here yet?

08:22.235 --> 08:25.673
Is Kool here yet?
Yeah, Kool is here.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.975
He's in the back yard with
his gangster rapper buddies.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.248
- Mom, he is not a gangster.
- He's not? Then what is he?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.580
- He's an artist.
- An artist?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.582
If he was an artist,
he'd be in college.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.750
You know college
isn't for everybody.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.619
Then who's it for?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.563
It's for me.
I'm going to college and Kool isn't.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.655
What, so you want
to support a rapper?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.192
- We'll support each other.
- You'll support each other?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.027
You be nice to your new
son-in-law now.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.296
Excuse me? Son-in-law?
I don't think so.

08:49.329 --> 08:53.000
Darling, do you have any idea of the
life span of a rapper these days?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.169
I don't want my daughter to
be a widow at 25 years old.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.938
I want more for you.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.007
I want you to marry
a doctor or a lawyer,

09:00.040 --> 09:01.942
not some flaky artist.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.945
- I like Kool.
- It's not that I don't like him.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.747
I don't like
the company he keeps.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.616
Now what did I tell you?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.618
"If you want to see
your future tomorrow,

09:10.651 --> 09:12.720
look at your
friends today."

09:12.753 --> 09:16.156
Come on, girl, get
some sense about you.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.158
Okay.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.693
I love you, Mom.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.129
I love you, too.
I love you, too.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.932
You are my baby girl.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.169
I'm still marrying Kool.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.109
Hey, you guys had enough food?

09:38.045 --> 09:41.048
Okay, Pee Wee,
this is Tammy and this is Sasha.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.884
How are you ladies doing?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.619
Let me ask y'all,

09:45.653 --> 09:47.655
( stammers do... do
y'all kn-know... know...

09:47.688 --> 09:49.657
What a menage-a-trois is?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.360
Well, how about...
About just a foursome?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.831
Well h-how about...
How about an orgy?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.271
L-look here, let me
ask you a question.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.040
- Have you ever did it to two men at once?
- Please.

10:07.074 --> 10:11.111
What about one man at two?
It's a quarter till.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.051
Hi, Mrs. Farrell.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.888
Hello, Kool.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.123
- Hey, Kool.
- How are you doing, Mr. Farrell?

10:23.156 --> 10:25.158
Go ahead, Kool, ask her.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.828
Ask me what?

10:27.861 --> 10:31.699
Well, I was kind of
thinking that...

10:31.732 --> 10:34.001
Yes, Kool, you can
have some food.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.336
It's Kool's birthday next week

10:36.369 --> 10:39.873
and he and his friends
are gonna go to Vegas.

10:45.713 --> 10:46.914
No.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.317
You are not taking
my daughter to Sin City.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.386
Mrs. Farrell, I was just thinking it
could be a going-away present for her.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.724
Since we're not gonna see each other
for a while, I was hoping that...

10:56.757 --> 10:59.026
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back it up, okay?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.028
If you really want
to give her a present,

11:01.061 --> 11:04.231
the first-semester
schoolbooks are about $600.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.967
Why, Kool, you can
pick the tab up for that.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.971
Dad, you have some input
in this. Say something.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.942
Yeah, well, I think that we sh...

11:14.975 --> 11:17.277
It... it doesn't seem...

11:17.310 --> 11:20.347
You don't want to
sleep on the couch tonight.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.754
What happened to the big talk we
just had about compromising, Mom?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.756
I am compromising.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.192
Okay, Kool, you can
take her to a museum.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.994
To a mu...?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.029
You said he was an artist.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.169
Your mom is mean, man.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.380
Say, Harold, how about some
of those baby back ribs, man?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.840
Aw, man, you ate up
half the pig already.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.277
- This is my last time.
- Damn.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.445
I promise.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.320
Dawg, let me get
some potato salad.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.290
- You know I got you, baby.
- Good looking out.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.058
Where are you going
when you leave here?

12:05.092 --> 12:07.060
Man, we need to get
a hotel room,

12:07.094 --> 12:08.905
me and you go do something,
you know what I'm saying?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.263
- Shit.
- You with that?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.299
- All these hos?
- For sure, for sure.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.904
Young Joe Dawg.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.006
- What's up with you, baby?
- Nothing.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.341
- What are you drinking?
- Some Kool-Aid. You want some?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.343
- No, thanks.
- Christopher,

12:23.376 --> 12:25.779
now, you know only grown
folks drink in my house.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.948
Sorry, Auntie.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.818
Man, Joe, you're gonna
get us caught, man.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.085
Let's get up out of here.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.128
Watch out for the lawman.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.297
What's up, dawg?
How's the policing business going, baby?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.800
Saint, what the hell
are you doing here?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.902
What am I doing here?

12:48.936 --> 12:51.071
This is a neighborhood
barbecue, ain't it?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.073
Everyone is invited.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.075
You know something, nigga?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.544
I remember back in the day
we used to be friends, boy.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.555
You must have me confused
with someone else, Saint,

12:59.579 --> 13:01.882
'cause you and I
were never friends.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.918
Why are you trying to embarrass
me in front of my girls, man?

13:04.952 --> 13:09.089
Fake K-Mart, rent-a-cop
motherfucker.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.458
Yeah, I'll catch you
later, Saint.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.418
Remember, in a fight,
as in life,

13:38.451 --> 13:40.420
you've got to have the
courage and the discipline

13:40.453 --> 13:42.122
to go with the energy,
not against it.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.924
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.425
Because if you go
against the energy,

13:45.458 --> 13:47.427
you might wind up
living on the dark side.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.030
Remember, respect all
and fear none.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.933
- Okay? Any questions?
- No, sir.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.567
Salute.
Thank you.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.341
Before we close today,
I have a very special promotion.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.577
Kool, right here.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.980
Okay, down.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.249
Everybody down with us.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.321
Your father and I
grew up in this art.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.424
We got our black belts on
the same day from Mr. Parker.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.193
This is a very special moment.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.497
Thank you.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.536
In Kenpo, when a brown
belt becomes a black belt,

14:29.569 --> 14:32.539
a boy becomes a man.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.475
Today you're a man.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.279
I know how proud
your father would be.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.586
This was also a gift from
Mr. Parker to your father

14:46.619 --> 14:48.621
many, many years ago.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.058
I think it's time you had it.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.131
Bow and touch your
forehead to the belt

14:58.165 --> 15:00.233
and pick it up.
It's yours.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.624
Hey, he should have

15:57.657 --> 16:00.260
put his ear in that
motherfucker's mouth.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.106
Man, fuck that. You ain't supposed to
bite nobody's ear while you're boxing.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.366
Look at this... this
motherfucker here.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.169
Damn, I wonder what
that shit feels like.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.507
What's up, boss?

16:19.079 --> 16:21.348
That nigga's
name is Saint.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.683
He got everything...
Money, power, bitches.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.619
I guess he's fixin'
to take over our hood.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.290
Man, I sure wish I knew
what that felt like.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.525
Shit, we rob his ass,
we'll see what it feels like.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.761
Y'all check this out.
Check this out. Check this out.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.064
There he go.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.332
♪♪ I need money,
mo' money, mo' money... ♪♪

16:39.366 --> 16:44.304
Kool, it's all right, but the beat
is bumping like a motherfucker.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.782
- Turn it up a little bit. - You know
what's wrong here, the problem is?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.776
Y'all niggas be hating. Y'all need
to give some niggas props, dawg.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.512
- Never. - Y'all niggas know
my rap's the bomb, dawg.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.647
Why don't you all say
my rap's the bomb?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.316
Your rap's the bomb.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.120
- What's up, LaShawna?
- So are you, baby.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.622
A-ain't that cute?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.392
Ghetto-ass Homeo and Luliet.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.394
That's Romeo and Juliet.

17:07.426 --> 17:10.230
You know, Pee Wee,
if you would start cracking a book

17:10.262 --> 17:14.401
and spend less time picking a crack
in your ass, you might know that.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.470
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm ready to break this spot.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.409
- What the fuck you doing, nigga?
- Hold up, dawg, play that shit.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.811
I tell you all, fellas,
it's about time I gotta leave.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.448
Peace, niggas.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.250
Does that mean we can't
listen to your beat?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.352
No, it just means
you gotta get your own.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.687
Say, Kool, I heard you
wanna be on motherfucking

17:34.721 --> 17:36.556
"Star Search"
or something, nigga.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.259
You gonna be like Vanilla
Ice, you motherfucker.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.763
That boy's in love.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.534
Something wrong with him.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.209
You remembered.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.311
Happy birthday, baby.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.612
Aww.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.381
Make a wish.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.254
What'd you wish for?

18:07.287 --> 18:10.557
A chance to finally
take you on a real date.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.559
When do you think
that's gonna happen?

18:12.592 --> 18:16.696
When I can get my mama
to let you in the door.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.732
So until then, you're just
taking advantage of me.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.469
I'd be happy to let you
take advantage of me.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.304
I want to.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.672
Good.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.544
What's this?

18:31.578 --> 18:34.414
It's an amulet.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.417
Master Keaton gave it to me.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.721
It means to always be
true to myself.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.723
I'll always be
true to you, baby.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.627
Me, too.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.541
What the fuck are you doing?

19:01.574 --> 19:03.443
I told you not to show
your face around here.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.645
Saint sent me.
He wants to know

19:05.678 --> 19:07.823
what's happening with this cat
that I'm meeting with tonight.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.183
There is no meeting tonight.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.485
What?

19:12.519 --> 19:15.888
I just found out that this guy's an
undercover cop in the Rampart Division.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.690
Is that right?

19:17.724 --> 19:19.392
Yeah.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.461
Well, there is gonna be
a meeting tonight

19:21.494 --> 19:23.696
and you'd better be there.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.938
Homicide.
Detective Mack speaking.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.478
So you're writing
a new song?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.281
It's called
"LaShawna's Groove."

19:41.314 --> 19:43.383
I want to hear it.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.917
No, you can't hear it right now.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.254
What do you mean I can't
hear it right now?

19:47.287 --> 19:50.457
When it's time.
But it's the bomb, baby.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.492
I ain't gonna lie.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.494
It's gonna get us out of here.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.597
One day I'm gonna
get you everything.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.599
I'm gonna spoil you rotten...

19:59.632 --> 20:04.337
Fur coats, diamond rings,

20:04.371 --> 20:06.406
Rolls-Royces, Bentleys.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.475
I don't need nothing
but you, Kool.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.743
I want to get us
out of here, man.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.480
It's only right.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.549
Don't you understand?

20:16.583 --> 20:19.919
Make sure my house has
a field of sunflowers.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.296
- God.
- Hold up.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.332
Coming, man.
Hold up.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.833
Damn.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.436
- Come on, dawg.
- Hey, you by yourself, dawg?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.647
- I'm with my girl. - Man,
it's Pee Wee. He's gone crazy tripping.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.707
- Come on, bro.
- What's going on?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.276
We gotta go handle this shit.
Fuck all that. Let's go, bro.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.030
Give me a minute.
I'll be out in one minute.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.550
Yo, babe, that was Tyrell
and them at the door.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.387
I heard. Go see
about your friend.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.589
I don't want you walking
home by yourself, though.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.526
I'll be fine.
Go on.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.361
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.430
That's why I love you.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.931
- Call me later.
- All right.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.999
- See you later, all right?
- Yeah.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.734
Hey, buddy, how's it going, man?

21:41.768 --> 21:43.870
- It's all right. How are you?
- All right.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.606
You got the stuff
we talked about?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.107
Yeah, I got it.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.009
You got the cheddar?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.411
The what?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.613
The money, fool.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.515
I have the money.
I have the money right here.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.849
Yeah?

22:10.697 --> 22:12.932
Just remember our deal.

22:37.924 --> 22:41.127
Help me.
Help me.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.630
- My God.
- Help me. Stay with me.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.033
Okay, okay, you just hold on.
My God.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.102
- Stay calm. I'll go get help.
- Stay with me.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.572
- My God. My God.
- My wallet. My wallet.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.173
What do you need?
What? I got it.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.008
- Get my wallet.
- I got it. Okay. I got it.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.612
Here you go. Here.

22:59.646 --> 23:02.682
My God, you're a cop.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.951
Is that your daughter?

23:04.984 --> 23:06.653
She's beautiful.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.956
Okay, okay.
Here.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.758
You're all right.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.696
Who did this to you?
Who did this?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.131
Hang on.
Hang on, all right?

23:19.165 --> 23:23.936
- I'm cold.
- Here. Here.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.975
God, just hold on, all right?
Hold on. You're gonna be fine.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.645
My God.

23:32.679 --> 23:35.114
It was
that moment... just that quick,

23:35.147 --> 23:38.851
everything changed.
In the hood, things can turn on a dime.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.823
Hey, hey, hey, lady, lady,
where are you going?

23:43.856 --> 23:46.726
Hey, lady, stop. Hold it.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.596
Freeze!
Lady, freeze!

24:03.109 --> 24:05.077
Get away from the door!
Hands up!

24:05.111 --> 24:06.913
Freeze!
Hold it right there!

24:06.946 --> 24:08.548
Mama, mama, mama!

24:08.581 --> 24:11.618
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Mama!

24:11.651 --> 24:14.754
- I need everyone to step out of
the house slowly. - No! No! No!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.789
- Step out of the house.
- No!

24:16.823 --> 24:18.791
All right, now slowly
turn around

24:18.825 --> 24:21.561
- and put your hands up on the wall.
- Are you all right?

24:21.594 --> 24:23.896
- Ma'am.
- What did she do?

24:23.930 --> 24:27.567
- I'm gonna tell you, ma'am.
- Wait a minute, what did she do?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.068
Please do what I say.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.538
Slowly turn around and
put your hands on the wall.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.806
- Joseph, go get Kool. Go.
- Hold it right there.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.708
- Just stand still. Don't move.
- Joseph!

24:35.742 --> 24:37.777
- Kool! Kool!
- Ma'am, again,

24:37.810 --> 24:39.746
turn around and put
your hands on the wall.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.615
Okay, just relax.
Just calm down.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.017
- What did she do?
- Just relax. No one's...

24:45.051 --> 24:48.020
- What did she do? - I didn't do
anything, Mama. I don't know anything.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.591
Ma'am, everything will be fine.
Just put your hands on the wall.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.059
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.127
No one is gonna
hurt anyone, ma'am,

24:55.161 --> 24:58.264
if you please put your
hands on the wall slowly.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.802
I was just trying to help him.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.837
I didn't do anything, Mama.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.906
I didn't do anything.

25:06.939 --> 25:10.109
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.644
It's okay.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.312
I am not gonna
let them hurt you.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.548
Mama.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.083
Mama!

25:17.116 --> 25:19.852
Ma'am.

25:19.886 --> 25:23.322
- Ma'am, step back.
- I'll get you out of this.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.091
Open it up.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.959
Somebody get her.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.828
In the car.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.130
Get in the car.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.600
Just relax.
Just relax.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.668
Roberts.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.037
Take her away.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.640
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.977
Shawna! Shawna, wait!
Mama, why are they taking her?

25:45.011 --> 25:47.614
Shawna! Shawna! Shawna!

25:47.647 --> 25:49.949
Hey, hey. I got him.
I got him. I got him.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.118
Hey, man, tell me what's
going on around here.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.953
Why are these cops out here?

25:53.986 --> 25:55.922
That's what I've been
wanting to ask you, Kool.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.891
- What? - LaShawna just got
charged with murder one.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.160
What?

26:01.193 --> 26:03.963
Eddy, you know LaShawna could
never do nothing like this.

26:03.996 --> 26:07.266
Yeah, I do.
What about you?

26:07.299 --> 26:11.070
Eddy, you know LaShawna
her whole life.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.371
You know what I mean?
Forever.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.307
We boys. Right?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.980
I guess we are friends, Kool.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.091
I'd like to help you with this
one, but my hands are tied.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.818
- It's not my case.
- Whose case is it?

26:25.852 --> 26:27.854
This hard-ass white cop
named Tully.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.622
Where can I find him at?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.294
- That's him right there.
- Thanks, Eddy.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.329
- Officer Tully.
- Yeah?

26:37.363 --> 26:39.666
- I need to talk to you.
- Make an appointment.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.744
- I need to talk to you now.
- I don't have the time.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.003
- It's important, though.
- I don't have the time, son.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.281
- What do you mean, you don't have time?
- You make the appointment

26:46.305 --> 26:49.141
or you'll get in trouble here.
Goodbye.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.563
Somebody tell
me what the fuck's going on.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.450
Detective Division.
Hold, please.

28:04.483 --> 28:07.186
Ma'am, I'm here to see
Detective Tully.

28:07.219 --> 28:10.757
- Do you have an appointment? - No, but I
just seen him. He told me to come down here.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.893
- Okay, well, have a seat. I'll tell him.
- I'm here to see my girl.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.962
She don't belong in there.
She didn't do this.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.998
You need to have
a seat. Okay?

28:19.031 --> 28:21.033
I can't believe this shit.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.304
If you don't have evidence,
you don't have a case.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.473
Call me back when you got
something to say.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.176
Jiminy, I can't believe it.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.012
Come in.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.481
Sorry to bother you, sir.
There's someone here to see you.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.183
Do they have an appointment?

28:37.216 --> 28:39.786
No, sir,

28:39.819 --> 28:41.921
but she's insisting on
seeing the officer in charge

28:41.954 --> 28:43.990
and I think you might
want to see this girl.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.892
Okay, send her in.

28:47.994 --> 28:51.263
- Thank you so much. I really
appreciate it. - My pleasure.

28:51.297 --> 28:54.867
Hi. Look, okay,
I got charged with prostitution,

28:54.901 --> 28:57.012
but it's not what it sounds like.
I'm not a prostitute.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.514
I went to a bachelor party to do a
dance, and that's all I did.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.808
I'm actually a college student.
And I went in there

29:01.841 --> 29:03.876
and I danced around
and the guys...

29:03.910 --> 29:06.512
Did you have sex with
any of the men there?

29:06.545 --> 29:08.781
No, I didn't have sex
with any... I did nothing.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.950
Let me show you what I did.
This is all I did.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.285
I walked up to the guys.
I mean, they sat around...

29:13.319 --> 29:15.021
This is while you're dancing?

29:15.054 --> 29:17.123
Yeah, at a bachelor party,
you know, like this.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.228
What else did you do?

29:22.261 --> 29:24.530
Well, I took my top off.

29:24.563 --> 29:28.367
Topless in the face.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.270
And I do this thing with a dollar,
and that's when they arrested me.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.005
What is that?

29:33.039 --> 29:34.841
I put a dollar right there.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.142
There?

29:36.175 --> 29:38.144
There, and I...

29:38.177 --> 29:40.146
I take it like this.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.414
Okay, okay, okay,
that's good.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.917
Okay, zip up.
I'm gonna give you my card.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.453
I want you to call this
number after midnight

29:47.486 --> 29:49.455
- and we'll have an interview, okay?
- All right.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.891
- It's really important.
- I know it is.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.592
- Okay.
- What's your name?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.594
- I'm Roxanne.
- Roxanne, take care of yourself.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.897
- And get a shirt.
- Okay, thank you.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.908
- Cover that up.
- I really appreciate it. Thank you.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.001
The pleasure is mine.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.577
Man, I've been here
for over an hour.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.612
Did you tell him I was here?

30:13.645 --> 30:16.615
Yes, I told him.
And he'll get to you when he's ready.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.219
- Please sit down.
- That's bullshit. I gotta go see him now.

30:20.252 --> 30:23.089
Where you going? You're not
allowed back there. Wait a minute.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.500
I've been waiting for two hours out here.
When the hell are you gonna help me?

30:25.524 --> 30:27.635
- Sorry, sir. - You told me to
make an appointment and I made one.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.062
- Come outside.
- Get this idiot out of here.

30:30.096 --> 30:33.299
Man, Tully,
my girlfriend is innocent.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.035
Just tell me what I gotta do.
I'll do anything.

30:36.068 --> 30:40.206
- What's your girl's name?
- LaShawna... LaShawna Farrell.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.942
- Come on, let's go.
- Let him go.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.178
You gonna be all right, sir?

30:46.212 --> 30:49.348
I'll be fine.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.483
Have a seat.

30:53.419 --> 30:56.455
- So that's your girl?
- Yeah.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.991
It'd be a shame to see
all that prettiness

30:59.025 --> 31:01.928
get raped away in some
penitentiary up north.

31:01.961 --> 31:05.164
- My girl didn't kill nobody.
- I don't know that.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.499
The only thing I know
is two things...

31:07.533 --> 31:09.969
One is what my men
saw in the alley.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.104
- What's two?
- Instincts.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.672
- Instincts?
- Yeah.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.909
I have a feeling there's
someone new in town

31:16.943 --> 31:19.011
that might be behind
this pile of shit

31:19.045 --> 31:21.313
that you find your girl
and you standing in.

31:21.347 --> 31:24.483
- I could be wrong.
- But what if you're right?

31:24.516 --> 31:26.085
Then your girl goes free.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.487
Then why don't you just
go bust his ass?

31:28.520 --> 31:31.657
You got all these cops here.
Take your men and just go bust their ass.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.326
That's good.
Why didn't I think of that?

31:34.360 --> 31:38.197
Problem is, I don't have enough
evidence to pin murder on him.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.632
Just instincts,
and they're never wrong.

31:40.666 --> 31:44.303
- Never?
- Never.

31:46.638 --> 31:50.042
I need to find somebody
to get down with his crew

31:50.076 --> 31:52.278
so the crew will trust him.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.281
Do you know who that
someone might be?

31:57.183 --> 31:58.951
What's their name?

31:58.985 --> 32:00.152
Saint.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.354
Saint?

32:02.388 --> 32:06.125
- Ring a bell?
- Yeah, I've seen him before

32:06.158 --> 32:08.160
and I don't think
you want to fuck with him.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.531
Yes, I do.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.551
Hi.

33:05.584 --> 33:09.021
- How are you doing?
- Not so good.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.023
It's scary, you know?

33:11.057 --> 33:12.624
But I'm innocent.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.526
I know.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.395
They can't keep me
in here forever, right?

33:16.428 --> 33:18.664
I don't know what
they're gonna do.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.800
But I think I found
a way to get you out.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.503
- I'm gonna get you out.
- What are you talking about?

33:24.536 --> 33:27.506
- I can't tell you right now.
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?

33:27.539 --> 33:30.309
- I just can't tell you right now.
- Kool, I'm innocent.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.620
The police will find that out
and they'll let me go, right?

33:32.644 --> 33:36.482
Right?

33:38.650 --> 33:41.620
They will.
I know they will.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.622
So you just keep
your hands clean.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.692
You hear me?

33:46.725 --> 33:48.794
- Look, LaShawna, I can't...
- No, listen.

33:48.827 --> 33:52.164
You're a good person.
You stay that way.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.699
You hear me?

33:55.334 --> 33:57.136
LaShawna, I can't keep you
in jail like...

33:57.169 --> 33:59.571
Just promise me you'll stay
a good person, Kool.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.277
But I don't know if I can
promise you this.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.646
I don't know.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.848
You know,
I never could understand

34:09.880 --> 34:13.119
how LaShawna could care
more about me than herself.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.286
She was like that.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.356
But I couldn't stand to
see her locked up in jail.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.092
I just had to do something to get her out.
I just had to.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.629
Make sure she doesn't
say anything

34:23.661 --> 34:25.364
until we find her
the right lawyer.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.141
But I don't know why.
She's got nothing to hide.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.635
- She told them everything she knows.
- And?

34:29.668 --> 34:33.239
And it's like the whole
system doesn't work anymore.

34:33.272 --> 34:36.275
I mean, you see her...
A black girl

34:36.308 --> 34:39.311
with a little cop blood on
her... a white cop at that.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.580
The man's trying to hang
her, throw away the key.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.858
- You know she was only trying to
save his life. - I understand that,

34:43.882 --> 34:46.318
but, see, that's why we've got
to find her the right lawyer.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.654
I've got a friend.
Now just let me make a phone call.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.295
Hey.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.666
How come you're not ready?

35:05.637 --> 35:07.606
I'm not going.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.576
Baby, what do you
mean, you're not going?

35:10.609 --> 35:12.678
I can't.

35:12.711 --> 35:16.615
I can't stand to see my
daughter in some jail cell.

35:16.648 --> 35:21.387
Look, Dee,

35:21.420 --> 35:24.390
this is hard on me, too.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.459
I need you.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.761
She needs you.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.401
Do you know what today is?

35:35.434 --> 35:37.503
What today is?
Today...

35:37.536 --> 35:41.207
God, college.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.209
- College.
- College.

35:43.242 --> 35:47.346
After all your hard work,
our hard work,

35:47.379 --> 35:49.181
our daughter should be
in a college dorm,

35:49.215 --> 35:52.484
not some jail cell.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.953
I can't.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.623
You want to see her... you go.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.957
I can't see her today.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.261
- Not today, baby.
- All right.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.463
Okay, you go. Okay?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.498
Okay.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.235
Okay.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.610
- What did he say? - I just hung up
with him. He's gonna help us out.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.946
Great. Yes!
So when can we go see her?

36:20.979 --> 36:24.316
Well, he'll be available
for us in a couple of days.

36:24.350 --> 36:27.986
Man, I can't wait
a couple of days.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.756
Shawna's locked up.
I gotta get her out, man.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.824
Shawna's in jail.
I can't...

36:35.494 --> 36:37.829
Look, Kool, this guy is
really a big-time lawyer.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.666
He's gonna help us.
He's gonna be able to get her out.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.834
He said that?

36:42.868 --> 36:44.836
No, he didn't say that,

36:44.870 --> 36:46.772
but look, we're kind of
caught in the loop here.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.885
You know, this is just the
way that the system works.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.285
All right, hold it.
Break! Back up.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.620
Dave, do you mind stepping out?
Come on in.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.256
Come on, Kool.
This will be good for you.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.668
Come on, we'll work out.
We'll get your mind off it a little bit.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.660
Come on. Is it all right with
you, Mohammed?

37:08.694 --> 37:10.538
- It's all right.
- Okay, fighting stance. Come on.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.965
Come on, get in
a fighting stance.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.667
You ready?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.436
Fight!

37:19.805 --> 37:22.007
Break!
Back up.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.709
Are you all right?
Come here.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.477
What's the matter with you?

37:25.511 --> 37:27.913
You know better
than to do that in here.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.917
Man, fuck this shit.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.787
Just tell me what I gotta
do, man.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.756
To get my girl out,
I'll do anything.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.025
Look at this.
This looks like a phone,

37:40.058 --> 37:42.027
but it's not.
It's a recorder.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.696
So, you will go in, punch power,

37:44.730 --> 37:47.666
and you will record
their conversations.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.369
We'll get a confession
on clear tape

37:50.402 --> 37:51.870
then we'll bust him.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.606
This is gonna be a piece of cake.
We got your back.

37:54.640 --> 37:58.444
So if I do this,
I get my girl back?

37:58.477 --> 38:00.779
Don't worry about it.
We'll get her out.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.615
Yeah, it'll help
getting her back.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.784
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.354
Let's go. Let's go.
You got the keys to the car?

Those guys up there, man...
They're killers.

38:29.841 --> 38:33.011
They already killed a cop.
Think they won't take me out?

If you don't follow
through with this order,

Shit, it's Ribbe.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.795
Yeah? Who is he?

38:49.828 --> 38:51.430
I've been knowing him
since I was 12.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.932
What else?

38:53.965 --> 38:56.067
He's a friend
of LaShawna's, too.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.112
He was like a close friend of
ours till he started for Saint.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.806
He's sure to recognize us.
We better call this off.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.150
- I don't think it's gonna work.
- Shut up. I'll take care of it.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.644
Open the glove box and
hand me what's in there.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.615
What are you gonna do with this?

39:09.648 --> 39:12.651
Act nonchalant.
I'm gonna do my job.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.962
- You got a cigarette?
- Say what?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.865
- You got a cigarette?
- Yeah, sure, man.

39:28.066 --> 39:31.136
What?

39:31.169 --> 39:34.005
- You killed him!
- Cigarettes will fucking kill you.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.041
What you did?

39:36.074 --> 39:39.611
This gun has your
fingerprints all over it.

39:39.645 --> 39:42.848
That makes you the killer.
That's life without parole.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.984
If you don't get your ass in there
and do what you're ordered to do,

39:46.017 --> 39:49.821
you're going away
for a long time.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.996
This is bullshit.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.198
We'll see you when you're done.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.634
Fucking pig.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.107
Here we go, baby.
We whipped that ass, didn't we?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.745
Yo, man, where's Saint?
All right.

40:16.882 --> 40:19.951
- Yo, Saint.
- Hey, hey, where are you going, man?

40:19.985 --> 40:22.153
- Where are you going?
- I need to talk to Saint, man.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.691
- No, that ain't happening, partner.
- It's cool. It's cool.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.926
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

40:27.959 --> 40:30.596
I got some business.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.699
He wants to talk to me
about business.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.767
He wants to talk
about some business?

40:45.076 --> 40:46.878
What kind of business
you got, man?

40:46.912 --> 40:49.748
I want to be down with you.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.883
- I want to get paid.
- You want to get paid?

40:51.917 --> 40:54.219
Don't sound like you
want to do no business.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.922
Sounds like you want me to
do you a motherfucking favor.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.827
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't want no trouble.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.529
I just came to talk to Saint.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.206
Well, you're gonna get
some trouble, motherfucker,

41:05.230 --> 41:06.765
if you don't get
the fuck out of here.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.967

41:31.022 --> 41:32.891

41:32.924 --> 41:35.126
Yeah, I know how to fight,

but I don't really like to.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.865

41:45.871 --> 41:48.006
I know you just had a cop
knocked off.

know that?

Fish warehouse...
You know where that is?

42:19.838 --> 42:21.907
Yeah.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.876
All right, Kool.

42:24.910 --> 42:25.977
See you then.

42:26.011 --> 42:28.179
Okay.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.716
If I got
with this motherfucker Saint,

42:30.749 --> 42:33.351
I knew I'd be one step closer
to getting LaShawna out

42:33.384 --> 42:34.620
and that's all I wanted.

42:39.858 --> 42:42.293
What happened?

42:42.327 --> 42:43.862
It's not enough.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.697
What you mean, it's not enough?

42:45.731 --> 42:47.899
It's not enough.
There's too much garbage on the tape.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.801
You can't hear it properly.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.879
You told me all I needed was a confession.
I got you a confession.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.271
Now it's not enough.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.273
You didn't get
a clear confession.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.375
What you need to do is get down

42:57.408 --> 42:59.745
and get close to him
so he'll trust you.

42:59.778 --> 43:02.881
Catch him in the act of doing something.
Then we can put him away.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.917
I cannot get down with this man.
To get close to him is impossible.

43:05.951 --> 43:08.654
That's your job.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.756
You're not helping
your girl at all.

As a matter of fact,
I think you should go see her right now.

good condition.

why don't you take him?

- Come on, let's go see her.

43:21.266 --> 43:23.168
Kool, what are you doing here?
Something wrong?

43:23.201 --> 43:26.337
- What'd they do to you?
- What are you talking about?

43:26.371 --> 43:28.807
Officer Tully said you were
in some kind of condition.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.844
Officer Tully?
Why were you talking to a cop?

43:32.878 --> 43:36.114
- LaShawna, what'd they do to you?
- They didn't do nothing.

43:36.147 --> 43:37.949
What's all the shit
he's talking about?

43:41.119 --> 43:44.923
LaShawna, look at me.

43:47.358 --> 43:50.195

I didn't want
to tell you like this.

43:56.434 --> 43:59.037
I didn't want to tell you we
were gonna be a family in jail.

Pregnant?

Afraid of her living the rest

44:47.018 --> 44:51.256
I barely knew my father.

44:53.424 --> 44:55.093

No retirement,

no savings.

This goddamn fish warehouse

45:10.108 --> 45:14.179
broke his back
and left him nothing.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.448
All they did was take and take.

six feet under,

45:24.022 --> 45:26.424

- What?

45:26.457 --> 45:29.160
I bought that motherfucker.

45:29.194 --> 45:31.396
- You know why?
- Why?

Because I never want to forget

that a motherfucking fish

45:44.075 --> 45:46.044
Always get paid.

45:46.077 --> 45:49.848
You know what I'm saying?
Always get paid.

45:51.850 --> 45:53.118
Do you want to get paid?

45:53.151 --> 45:54.986
Yeah.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.890
Then you gotta help me clean
my organization of a bad fish.

45:58.924 --> 46:00.491
What do you mean?

46:00.525 --> 46:02.928
Bad fish's name is Willie.

46:02.961 --> 46:05.563
I took over his neighborhood.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.499
Motherfucker made his first
payment, but I'm sure it was short.

46:08.533 --> 46:11.069
I need you to get my money.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.538
It's your first test.

46:13.571 --> 46:15.140
Can you pass it?

46:17.208 --> 46:18.209
Yeah.

46:18.243 --> 46:20.111
You got a gun?

46:22.013 --> 46:24.115
Yeah, I got one.

46:24.149 --> 46:26.317
I don't really believe
in violence myself.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.388

it's necessary.

- What are you doing here?

46:43.001 --> 46:45.079
- Where's your brother at?
- What the fuck do you want?

46:45.103 --> 46:47.405
- You know smoking's bad for you?
- Fuck you, man.

46:47.438 --> 46:49.107
Fuck you.

46:53.544 --> 46:56.514

You know it takes a person four
minutes to die without air?

47:50.135 --> 47:52.546
And three if they're panicking.
And this nigga panicking.

47:52.570 --> 47:55.273
- So where the money at?
- I ain't got no motherfucking money.

47:55.306 --> 47:58.119
Look, nigga, let's bust a deal. What the
fuck you want? Drugs? I got that shit.

47:58.143 --> 48:01.055
Fuck drugs. I ain't gonna play no games.
Don't make me use this motherfucker.

48:01.079 --> 48:03.448
Now get the fuck up
and get my money.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.917
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you motherfucking money.

48:05.951 --> 48:08.395
- Just take the bag off my brother's head.
- Fuck this nigga, bro.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.655
I'm calling the shots, nigga.
I want my money, dawg.

48:10.688 --> 48:13.925
Get my fucking money.
Come on, let's go, get up.

48:13.959 --> 48:15.994
Come on.

48:20.698 --> 48:23.969
I'm gonna tell you, nigga,
don't you fuck with Saint's money no more.

48:24.002 --> 48:26.004
Now get out of here.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.440
Breathe, nigga, breathe.
Breathe, nigga.

48:29.474 --> 48:31.176

- Good to see you.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.525
- You want something to drink?
- What you got here?

48:47.558 --> 48:51.296
I got vodka.
I got gin. I got rum.

48:51.329 --> 48:53.298
What you want? Rum and Coke?
Vodka and cranberry?

48:53.331 --> 48:55.400
What you want? Carrot juice?
What? What?

48:55.433 --> 48:57.535
- Gin, fine.
- Get him a gin, man.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.237
Gin and... you want
something in it?

48:59.270 --> 49:01.006
You want tonic?
You want orange juice? What?

49:01.039 --> 49:03.574
- Naw, gin straight.
- Straight gin, my man.

49:03.608 --> 49:07.412
So you got something
for me, Mr. Kool?

49:07.445 --> 49:10.015
As a matter of fact, I do.

49:10.048 --> 49:12.050
Yeah, yeah.

I gotta tell you, boy,
you got steel in your heart.

49:18.589 --> 49:20.725
I never thought
you'd pull this thing off.

49:20.758 --> 49:24.495
And you know how you did it?
I didn't have to ask you twice.

49:24.529 --> 49:27.098
See what I'm saying?
My man's a soldier.

49:27.132 --> 49:29.734

Freeze!
Put your hands on your head!

53:14.525 --> 53:16.227
Freeze!

53:16.261 --> 53:20.431
Stop where you are!
Don't move!

53:20.465 --> 53:23.234
You are surrounded.
Stop right there!

53:23.268 --> 53:25.436
Hey, hey!

53:34.979 --> 53:37.482
Get him on the other side!
Move, move, move, move!

53:41.486 --> 53:43.521
Move it, move it, move it.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.756
Hold it.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.991
Aw, fuck.

54:24.862 --> 54:26.864
- Yo, Kool.
- What up, Pee Wee?

54:26.897 --> 54:29.600
I got some tickets to P's concert tomorrow.
You down, right?

54:29.634 --> 54:31.945
- No, I ain't gonna make it. - What
the fuck you mean, you can't make it?

54:31.969 --> 54:35.005
- I got plans, nigga.
- What kind of plans you got

54:35.039 --> 54:38.476
where you can't come
hang out with your boys?

54:39.477 --> 54:41.312
Kool.

54:41.346 --> 54:43.047
I told you, dawg,
my girl gets out tonight.

54:43.080 --> 54:46.083
How-how the fuck
is your girl getting out tonight?

54:46.116 --> 54:47.752
I found a way, nigga.

54:47.785 --> 54:50.020
Hey, yo, Kool, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

54:50.054 --> 54:52.690
For real,
what the fuck did you do?

54:55.593 --> 54:57.428
I dropped the dime on Saint.

54:57.462 --> 54:59.797
I made a deal with the cops.

54:59.830 --> 55:02.367
You're the motherfucker
that dropped that dime?

55:02.400 --> 55:04.469
Keep your mouth closed, nigga.

55:04.502 --> 55:07.004
I dropped a dime on the nigga.
My girl's getting out tonight.

55:08.939 --> 55:11.308
Keep your mouth closed.

55:26.724 --> 55:28.893
Open the door.

55:34.499 --> 55:36.367
LaShawna Farrell?

55:36.401 --> 55:37.568
Yeah.

55:37.602 --> 55:39.637
I'm Officer Mack Stevens.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.806
I want you to come with me.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.841
I'm getting out?

55:45.843 --> 55:48.646
Get the fuck in.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.648
What are you doing?

55:50.681 --> 55:52.683
What?

55:52.717 --> 55:54.552
- I...
- Shut the fuck up.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.487
- What's going on?
- Shut the fuck up!

55:56.521 --> 56:00.458
You don't talk. I do the talking.
You got that?

56:00.491 --> 56:02.769
- What the fuck did he tell you?
- What are you talking about?

56:02.793 --> 56:05.563
I'm talking about that guy in the alley.
What the fuck did he say?

56:05.596 --> 56:07.798
- He was dying.
- What did he say before he died?

56:07.832 --> 56:10.076
- He didn't say anything. He was dying.
- That's bullshit.

56:10.100 --> 56:12.570
- What are you doing?
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

56:12.603 --> 56:15.840
- You're a cop. - Don't you
fucking lie to me, you lying bitch!

56:15.873 --> 56:17.742
God damn it, get up!
Get up!

56:20.044 --> 56:22.423
- What do you want? - Listen,
I'm gonna beat the holy shit out of you

56:22.447 --> 56:24.591
if you don't tell me what happened.
Now what the fuck happened?

56:24.615 --> 56:28.152
- Nothing happened.
- What the fuck happened?

56:28.185 --> 56:29.954
You'd better fucking talk to me.

56:29.987 --> 56:32.657
- Now what did you tell Kool?
- What are you doing?

56:32.690 --> 56:34.935
- Don't fucking lie to me. Don't you
fucking lie to me. - What are you doing?

56:34.959 --> 56:37.662
Look, you little fucking whore,
you talk to me right now.

56:37.695 --> 56:40.565
- What the fuck did he say to you?
- He didn't say anything.

56:40.598 --> 56:43.501
- What the fuck did he say to you?
- I don't know.

56:43.534 --> 56:45.670
I'll beat the fucking shit out of you.
You got that?

56:45.703 --> 56:47.938
What did you say to him?

56:47.972 --> 56:50.908
I didn't say anything to Kool.
He doesn't have anything to do with this.

56:50.941 --> 56:53.578
God damn you, you lie
to me one more time...

56:58.148 --> 57:00.594
I wonder what
she was thinking at that moment.

57:00.618 --> 57:02.620
She was the one who always
believed in justice.

57:02.653 --> 57:05.490
So did I, till then.

57:05.523 --> 57:08.192
I couldn't understand it.
Why my girl?

57:08.225 --> 57:10.194
That just proves it...

57:10.227 --> 57:13.464
There's no justice
in this world.

57:13.498 --> 57:16.100
It's the world that
I'm losing faith in, fast.

57:22.006 --> 57:23.974
- Next.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

57:24.008 --> 57:25.952
- Excuse me, she is next.
- Ma'am, this is important.

57:25.976 --> 57:27.845
I need to see LaShawna Farrell.

57:27.878 --> 57:29.714
She's my girl.
She's getting out tonight.

57:29.747 --> 57:31.916
You can't see this prisoner
without an appointment.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.860
What do you mean, I can't see
her without an appointment?

57:33.884 --> 57:35.853
She's supposed to be
getting out.

57:35.886 --> 57:39.557
I'm sorry. Apparently she's not
available for visitors anyway.

57:39.590 --> 57:42.727
- It looks like she's in the infirmary.
- For what?

57:42.760 --> 57:45.563
I'm sorry, sir,
that's all I can tell you.

57:45.596 --> 57:47.541
Ma'am, you're trying to tell
me my girl's in the hospital

57:47.565 --> 57:50.200
- and y'all ain't gonna tell
me the problem? - Nelson.

57:50.234 --> 57:52.546
- That's all I can tell you. - Don't you
think somebody should tell me something?

57:52.570 --> 57:54.772
Sir... Nelson, get him
out of here.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.883
- I'm not going away till somebody
tells me something. - Next.

57:56.907 --> 58:00.010
- Let me go, man.
- Come on. Let's go.

58:00.044 --> 58:01.946
Come on.

58:10.855 --> 58:14.291
Yo, Eddy, Eddy, LaShawna's
in the infirmary.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.293
- Yeah, I know.
- I need you to help me, man.

58:16.326 --> 58:18.763
Can you get me in?
I need to see her.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.965
Okay, I'm gonna see
what I can do for you.

58:20.998 --> 58:23.276
- Just wait right here a minute and
let me take care of it. - Thanks, Eddy.

58:23.300 --> 58:25.570
Come on now.
Yeah, you just happened

58:25.603 --> 58:27.972
to grab the purse on the way
down to the ground, didn't you?

58:30.140 --> 58:32.076
- He's with me.
- Okay.

58:33.944 --> 58:38.015
- Okay, great.
- Dr. Carlson, he needs to see his girl.

58:38.048 --> 58:41.318
She's in no condition to see anybody, guys.
She's been severely beaten.

58:41.351 --> 58:45.122
And she just really... I said she's
in no condition to see anybody.

58:49.259 --> 58:51.562
LaShawna.

58:58.235 --> 59:01.105
LaShawna, baby, what happened?

59:07.645 --> 59:09.179
Hi, baby.

59:17.354 --> 59:20.257
Who did this?

59:20.290 --> 59:22.793
Who did this?

59:22.827 --> 59:25.062
Tell me.

59:25.095 --> 59:27.632
Who the fuck did this?

59:29.634 --> 59:32.036
I lost the baby.

59:33.904 --> 59:36.273
You still want me, Kool?

59:40.110 --> 59:43.280
I'm sorry.

59:56.393 --> 59:59.129
Nurse!

59:59.163 --> 01:00:01.699
Yes, it's okay.
Okay.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.901
- Don't just stand there. Help her.
- You gotta leave.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.946
You need to get out of here
and let us do our job, okay?

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.205
- You can't stay here.
- No, I gotta stay by her, man.

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:09.916
Gotta go. Come on,
let the doctors do their work.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.909
I couldn't believe it.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.912
Right before my eyes,
she was just slipping away.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:19.149
Her life, our life,
our baby's life...

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.819
My world was getting
completely destroyed

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:24.021
and I couldn't do
nothing about it.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:27.157
Lord, amend unto Thee

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:30.127
the body, soul, and spirit

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.863
of our beloved
daughter and sister

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:34.999
LaShawna Farrell.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:39.136
I ask that You let her
find peace in heaven,

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:42.773
peace that she could not
find on this here earth.

01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:45.375
And we ask that You
make her truly happy

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:48.713
and safe within Your fold.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:51.882
For those of you
who knew LaShawna,

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.885
she was a pillar in our society.

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:57.321
She was a girl that never
caused anyone any trouble.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:00.324
She never caused anyone
any pain.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.127
She was the beloved daughter

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.163
of Mr. and Mrs. Farrell.

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:08.165
From the dust we came,

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.868
to the dust we shall return.

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:14.772
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:17.441
Amen.

01:01:24.749 --> 01:01:27.818
She was good.
She was a good girl.

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.727
Yeah, I still want you.

01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:40.064
You! Because of you,
my kid is dead!

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.266
- You scum.
- She was my girl, too.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:45.402
- Shut up. You shut up, trash.
- Come on, Delores.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:48.038
Get out of here.
You are not wanted.

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.040
Get away from me.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:53.210
Get away from me.
Stay away from my family.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:55.980
- Trash. Trash!
- Come on, come on.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:58.015
Kool, wait a second.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:02.987
Are you okay?

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.521
I'm fine.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.924
Can't you see I'm fine?

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:09.059
You're fine. They're fine.
Everybody's fine,

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:13.097
but LaShawna isn't, now is she?

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.033
I'm sorry. I know
how you must feel.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.368
You don't know how I feel.
You don't know shit how I feel.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.504
I appreciate you coming,
but you know what?

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:23.116
Some things I gotta do on my own.
I gotta take care of this shit on my own.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.877
Wait a minute.
Don't do anything stupid.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.316
Down!

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:14.791
I'm gonna get you.

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.620
Fuck you!

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.210
I'm gonna get you.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.546
You come fuck with us?

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.987
What do you think you're living
in, the Old West?

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:59.256
You've endangered civilians.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.125
You've caused hundreds
of thousands of dollars

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:03.060
of property damage,
wrecking cars.

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:05.495
God, what you've done
is inexcusable.

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:08.565
And that could put you
in jail for 20 years.

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:10.600
- 20 years?
- Yeah, think about it.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.070
He was a bad cop.
You must have forgot.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:16.040
- He came shooting at us.
- If I were you, I'd shut up.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:18.175
You're in enough trouble.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.524
Man, we thought we was
gonna find you out here.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.670
- What's up, my nigga Kool?
- What's up, dawg?

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.696
Man.

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.434
Man, this shit
ain't right, dawg.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.470
Life ain't right, man.
You know these motherfuckers

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.605
out here are playing
for keeps nowadays, feel?

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:51.575
You know what? It's about time I
started playing for keeps, too.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:54.211
What are you
talking about, Kool?

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.613
It's time to get paid.
It's time to make some real money.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.648
Nigga, you don't know
about playing hard.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:00.584
And what do you know
about making real money?

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.586
You want to be
a rapper, remember?

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:07.557
Nah, nigga, that was then.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:10.527
This is now.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.096
Y'all niggas down?

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:15.199
Shit, nigga, you know
I'm down with you, Kool.

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:18.268
- I'm gonna need y'all to do
one thing for me. - Anything.

01:07:18.302 --> 01:07:22.406
Round up all our boys.
We're having a meeting later.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:24.508
Shit, we could meet now.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.211
No, I got something
I gotta take care of now.

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.478
Y'all meet me later.

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:31.047
- Nigga, consider it done.
- Later.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.261
I'll always miss you.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:46.296
For sure.

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:01.645
Hey!

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:04.314
Girl Scout cookies,

01:08:04.348 --> 01:08:06.250
right on time.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.288
Where's the gun?

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:13.323
I'm a cop.
You're not gonna get away with this.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.697
Say where the gun's at.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.767
It's in the dresser,
second drawer.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.902
Where do you keep
the luggage at?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.272
Why do you want luggage?

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:29.749
I'm taking some
of these guns with me too.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.341
I'm taking
all this shit with me.

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:33.310
- This is my gun collection.
- Fuck that.

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:35.612
Don't you think you owe me this?

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:38.182
Guns are replaceable.
Your life isn't.

01:17:11.995 --> 01:17:15.298
I said Kool, not Kool-Aid.

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:19.168
Pee Wee, you see me trying to have
a good motherfucking time, nigga.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:22.972
We all happy and shit,
you bringing my spirits down.

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:26.876
Man, I'm about to go out of town

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:29.178
and I got to go
handle my business,

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:31.414
but I n-need to borrow
some money.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:34.851
Man, look, it's for Mama, man.

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:37.887
I got to pay her bills

01:17:37.921 --> 01:17:40.924
because they're talking about kicking
her out if her bills ain't paid.

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:43.226
- It's about Mama?
- Yeah, man.

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:44.961
She still making
them black-eyed peas?

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:48.464
Man, you know Mama be
making them peas, man.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.100
She told me to tell you hi, too.

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.703
All right.

01:17:53.737 --> 01:17:55.438
What you need?

01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:58.107
About $10,000.

01:17:58.141 --> 01:17:59.976
- Ten...?
- It's for Mama.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.747
I got to pay all
the bills and stuff.

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.315
- $10,000 for Mama?
- Yeah, man, she's gonna...

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:09.753
Mama sure gonna be happy
w-when she finds out

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:12.121
you done this for her.

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.025
Man, you sure is a friend.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:20.296
I-I'll pay y'all's drink bill.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:22.298
Thanks, man.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.301
That's probably too much
for that drink bill.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.506
I don't trust that nigga, man.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.809
I don't trust him.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.780
Trust... what is trust?

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:39.749
I started to wonder,
who could I really trust?

01:18:39.783 --> 01:18:43.052
That motherfucker Pee Wee was starting
to act real suspicious lately.

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:46.856
Looks like you and I
gotta make a little deal.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:49.926
You got a cigarette?

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:53.029
Sorry, I don't smoke.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:56.866
How the fuck are we gonna make a deal
if you can't even get me a cigarette?

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.511
This ain't a social call, Mo. We didn't
come here to drink and smoke together.

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:02.205
Quite frankly, if you don't
cooperate, I don't really give a shit.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:04.273
I'll send your ass back to jail.

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:07.243
Man, you ain't got shit on me.

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:10.046
So you want me to do your
motherfucking job for you?

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:12.015
Is that what you've come
to talk to me about?

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:13.883
Just cut the tough guy shit
with me.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.054
You know who killed my brother?

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:21.090
Yeah, your brother was hanged.

01:19:21.124 --> 01:19:24.527
The rope was so tight,
it almost took his head off.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.063
The word on the street...
You're gonna be next.

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.365
So I suggest,
if you know something,

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:33.002
you cooperate with me, 'cause right
about now I'm your only friend.

01:19:37.841 --> 01:19:41.444
This nigga T-Cat, man...
He's working for Kool,

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:44.380
but I know this nigga
on the same payroll.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.449
How do you know this?

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:49.585
I seen the niggas together. I don't
know who the fuck killed my brother,

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:52.155
but it's got to be
one of them fools.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:56.092
You want to take him out?
I know the perfect place.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.527
But you gotta get them
both together.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.396
I'm listening.

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:04.934
This nigga Saint got enough
money to beat any drug charge.

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:08.104
The fool just post bail
on a million-dollar bond.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:10.907
But this little nigga Kool...

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.242
He's quiet, but he's ruthless.

01:20:13.276 --> 01:20:15.845
And the nigga knows
Saint want to take him out,

01:20:15.879 --> 01:20:18.414
so he knows he gotta take
Saint out before he get him.

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:20.416
But that's when you come in.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:22.418
Let the motherfuckers
kill up each other,

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:25.288
and whoever's left,
you put 'em in jail.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.490
Now if you want me to
show you where they're at,

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:30.293
you gotta get my
black ass out of here.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:34.230
And I'll give you the time,
the place, and where to be.

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:36.532
Where are you going?

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.502
To get you some cigarettes.

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:42.105

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:45.474

I- I bet you won't lay down
with me and do this shit.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:57.053
Shut up, you little bitch.
Who the fuck sent you?

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:58.454
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:01.024
M-man, tell your

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:03.927
two girlfriends to move
so I can talk to you.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.529
Take him the fuck out of here.
In fact, kill his ass.

01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:10.066
No, no, y-you got to
listen to me, man.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.367
You got to listen, man.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.669
What the fuck do you want?

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.405
Nigga?
What the fuck do you want?

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:20.043
Man, they're gonna
put a hit out on you

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:21.644
and-and I know all about it.

01:21:21.677 --> 01:21:24.447
I can t-tell you everything.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.683
What do you mean,
they're coming to put a hit on me? Who?

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.486
Kool is gonna put
a hit out on you

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:33.289
and I can tell you
the time and the place.

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:35.624
But first y-you got to
guarantee me

01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:37.994
a position in your organization,

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:40.596
because Kool ain't
paying me shit.

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:44.000
What time, motherfucker?

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.936
I said what time,
motherfucker, and where?

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:49.305
Guarantee me the position
and I can take you there

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:51.007
and switch it around

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.277
and you can make
the hit on them.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.146
How do I know you're not lying?

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.550
Man, if I'm lying,
you can kill me.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:06.555
I believe you, little bitch.

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:11.260
Tell you what I want you to do...

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:15.564
I want you take me to Kool.
I want you to set it all up.

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:18.434
And I'm gonna take over his
whole motherfucking operation.

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:20.536
I'm wiping all those
motherfuckers out.

01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:25.074
Let him up.

01:22:25.108 --> 01:22:27.343
Get him a drink.

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:29.578
Get him out of here.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:33.516
Get your goddamn
hands off me, boy.

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:48.564
Hey, you little motherfucker,
what the fuck is you doing here?

01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:52.135
- What's up, dawg? No, I'm tasting it, man.
- Tasting it?

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:54.303
Man, you better get you a
cup of coffee or a lollipop

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:56.172
if you want to taste
something, nigga.

01:22:56.205 --> 01:22:58.117
You don't get paid to taste
the motherfucking dope.

01:22:58.141 --> 01:22:59.784
- Explain yourself, nigga.
- I'm just tasting it, dawg.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.610
- What?
- I was tasting it.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:03.884
Get the fuck out of here, nigga.
We're going to see Kool.

01:23:09.252 --> 01:23:12.755
Hey, Kool, this bitch-ass nigga
Pee Wee been sniffing, dawg.

01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:14.323
What?

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:18.127
What's up, Kool?
How-how you living?

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:21.264
Not well at all.

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:24.533
I called the old folks' home.

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:28.137
Your mama... she died last month

01:23:28.171 --> 01:23:30.106
and you ain't bothered
telling me?

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:33.042
I thought we went way back.

01:23:33.076 --> 01:23:36.545
I used to table with you and her.
I even ate her black-eyed peas.

01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:38.714
And you know I hate
black-eyed peas.

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:41.626
And you ain't bothered
to tell me the bitch died?

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:45.588
It-it never came up.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:48.057
B-but you know
Mama really loved you.

01:23:48.091 --> 01:23:50.093
This ain't about your mama.

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:55.331
Where you was last Sunday?

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.366
You cut a deal with him?

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.536
Didn't you?

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:03.239
He told you that?

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:06.675
You're motherfucking right I told
him, you bitch-ass nigga.

01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:10.379
You know what, Pee Wee?

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:15.751
We used to be boys.

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:18.354
You was my ace.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:22.358
Now, you're just another
ghetto stuttering motherfucker.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:26.562
Man, look, man, me and you...
We still boys, right?

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:29.298
Nah, Pee Wee.

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:31.434
Nah, not at all.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:34.370
We used to be boys,

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.206
but now I'm a motherfucking man.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.676
And you know what else?

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:42.111
I ain't to be fucked with.

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:44.180
Come on, man, come on.

01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:58.594
Why the fuck did you kill him?

01:24:58.627 --> 01:25:00.829
Kool, I mean, God damn, dawg,

01:25:00.863 --> 01:25:04.400
I seen this nigga talking to Saint
the other day. This nigga was a snake.

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:06.845
If I hadn't smoked that nigga,
he was gonna get us smoked, man.

01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:10.806
You know I'm only looking out for the Hot
Boyz, my nigga. You know how we do it.

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:13.509
Damn, dawg, I wasn't
even gonna kill 'em...

01:25:15.411 --> 01:25:17.480
I was just gonna send him home.

01:25:17.513 --> 01:25:21.417
- Shit, I sent him home for you, dawg.
- For sure.

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.593
Go, go, go, go.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:33.162
- Thanks. Where are they?
- They're all upstairs.

01:25:33.196 --> 01:25:36.199

Upstairs, go, go!

There was a
time when the world was ours.

01:30:16.512 --> 01:30:18.981
LaShawna, me, our child...

01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:21.484
The future looked so good.

01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:24.687
Now I'm on a dead-end path,
a crash course for destiny.

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.613
Funny... when you're
38 feet below,

01:30:50.646 --> 01:30:52.615
all the guns and the money
in the world

01:30:52.648 --> 01:30:54.617
don't even matter much.

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:57.185
You find yourself thinking
about the strangest things.

01:30:57.219 --> 01:30:59.955
I found myself thinking
a lot about justice

01:30:59.988 --> 01:31:03.091
and realized I had never
found any for myself.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:06.529
I had just been sinking
deeper and deeper.

01:31:06.562 --> 01:31:09.732
And now all I wondered is if
I had enough air to get away.

01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:11.767
And if I did get away,

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.069
did I have anything
to live for anymore?

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:16.071
Eventually they found me

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:18.073
and I found myself
locked in jail

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:20.108
for 30 years without parole

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:23.178
until Eddy got me off
on some legal loophole

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.614
after only serving five years.

01:31:25.648 --> 01:31:28.083
He gave me a second chance
to live a good life...

01:31:28.116 --> 01:31:31.086
The life my girl and my child
would approve of.

01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:39.227

always be true to you, baby.

- Yeah, Kool is here.

01:31:49.738 --> 01:31:52.207
He's in the backyard with
his gangster rapper buddies.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.677
- Mom, he is not a gangster.
- He's not? Then what is he?

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:57.012
- He's an artist.
- He's an artist?

01:32:00.816 --> 01:32:03.085
- So you're writing a new song?
- Yeah.

01:32:03.118 --> 01:32:06.321
- And guess what it's called.
- What?

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.791
"LaShawna's Groove."

01:32:08.824 --> 01:32:10.793
- I want to hear it.
- No, you can't hear it.

01:32:10.826 --> 01:32:14.229
- Why not?
- Um-um. When the time is right.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.132

You're not taking
my daughter to Sin City.

01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:37.786
Mrs. Farrell, I was thinking it could
be a going-away present for her.

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.756
I mean, since we're not gonna
see each other for a while...

01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:43.291
I don't need
nothing but you, Kool.

01:32:43.325 --> 01:32:46.895
