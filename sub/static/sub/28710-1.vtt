WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:05.237
<i> - Previously on</i>Pure...
- Sounds like the Menno mob.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.106
- You're kidding, right?
The Mennonite mob?

00:07.108 --> 00:10.075
You really do want these people,
<i> your</i>people, behind bars, huh?

00:10.077 --> 00:13.312
- They're violent and
degenerate. They're
your people now.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.682
- Ma'am, we have a warrant to
search the premises. Jackpot.
- That's not mine.

00:16.684 --> 00:21.687
- Gerry says someone gave the
police the drugs to plant so
he'd be forced to sell our land.

00:21.689 --> 00:25.457
- You put Gerry in jail?
Now you're the new boss.

00:25.459 --> 00:29.628
- Say no again, and it will be
your family in that hole.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.663
- Lie to anyone you want to,
but not to me.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.967
I will do whatever I have to
to protect my family.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.703
- So we're just going to pretend
that this is a normal day?

00:37.705 --> 00:40.939
That Foda didn't just tell
everyone he's going to war
with the drug dealers?

00:40.941 --> 00:43.475
- I had to tell Voss that
I would take Gerry's place.

00:43.477 --> 00:48.147
God wants me to submit to His
plan so I can meet everyone
in Voss' business

00:48.149 --> 00:51.250
and write down their names
and their crimes,

00:51.252 --> 00:53.819
and then I can destroy
this whole satanic mob.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.955
- Show me where
the money is counted.
- If I bring you into this,

00:56.957 --> 01:00.859
how do I keep you safe?
- If you don't, how
do I keep<i>you</i>safe?

01:00.861 --> 01:04.730
Your father and I want you
to accept Jesus Christ
into your heart

01:04.732 --> 01:07.366
as your earthly guide
and eternal saviour.

01:07.368 --> 01:11.637
- I need you, brother. The only
way we can do this is together.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.739
No!
(gasps)

01:15.709 --> 01:18.644
<i> Na!</i>
(gunshot)

01:21.048 --> 01:25.818
Accept God into your heart.
Repent.

01:25.820 --> 01:29.655
And pray for His mercy.

02:22.076 --> 02:25.344
(screaming)

03:00.915 --> 03:05.050
- No! No! No!
(gunshot)

03:05.052 --> 03:08.187
- Gentlemen.

03:08.189 --> 03:12.124
Your uncle Eli
let his guard down.

03:12.126 --> 03:15.160
Now he's dead,
as is his pipeline.

03:15.162 --> 03:20.799
So, you will act as my personal
Mennonite consultants.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.437
What do you say?

04:01.742 --> 04:05.611
(alarm clock ringing)

05:03.671 --> 05:07.472
- Amen.

05:07.474 --> 05:12.344
(dog barking, men shouting)

05:24.158 --> 05:27.993
(hubbub)

06:00.861 --> 06:03.895
- Hey, cheddar head.
You don't own this place.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.901
Foda drives away the devil that
they created,

06:09.903 --> 06:12.270
and they tell us to go to hell?
- Isaak.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.607
- They're all such hypocrites.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.746
- Find a table before
my arms fall off.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.884
- Detective Gates,

06:25.886 --> 06:29.221
how are you?
- Hi, Anna. What's going on?

06:29.223 --> 06:32.023
- It seems as though
we have been set aside

06:32.025 --> 06:34.893
from the church and the market.

06:34.895 --> 06:39.064
We will find another place.
Did you talk to your contact

06:39.066 --> 06:41.566
in Belize?
- Yeah, I did.

06:41.568 --> 06:45.303
Look, it's not much to go on,
but there was a guy

06:45.305 --> 06:47.739
that showed up at
an orphanage by the colony

06:47.741 --> 06:50.375
at San Ignacio.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.645
Might match Noah's description.
It's hard to tell.

06:53.647 --> 06:57.416
Went by the name Klaas Klassen,
worked his tail off,

06:57.418 --> 07:00.051
wouldn't take any money,
slept in a shed and moved on.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.121
But that was
six months ago, so...

07:03.123 --> 07:07.592
- So... what now?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.395
Is that it?
- Look, Anna,

07:10.397 --> 07:12.931
if a guy doesn't
want to be found,

07:12.933 --> 07:16.868
maybe it's best to--
- I understand.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.938
You have done more
than anyone could ask.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.809
- Well, I told Bronco
I'd do my best, but...
- I thank you.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.412
Please take some perishky.
- Oh no, you don't have to--

07:27.414 --> 07:31.216
- I insist. I want to give you
something for all you've done.

07:33.687 --> 07:37.456
- Look, my contact in Belize
said there's a truckload
of guys up here

07:37.458 --> 07:39.658
already working
for a local farmer.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.260
I'll find them, hand
around a picture of Noah

07:42.262 --> 07:45.831
and maybe someone will
recognise him. But...

07:45.833 --> 07:48.333
this has to be
a last shot kind of deal, OK?

07:52.372 --> 07:55.140
Thanks.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.809
<i> - 18 to 0?!</i>

07:57.811 --> 08:00.779
18-zip? If it was
basketball, OK,

08:00.781 --> 08:02.948
but it's hockey, Ricky.
You're all we've got.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.618
You're our number 1 and our
backup, but you stood there

08:06.620 --> 08:10.622
like a traffic cone.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:10.624 --> 08:14.793
Dial it back a little.
He feels bad enough.

08:14.795 --> 08:18.363
Ricky, go get changed. I need
a word with Coach Barry.
- Mom!

08:18.365 --> 08:21.833
Don't.
- Ricky, go.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.670
(sighing)

08:25.672 --> 08:28.273
You need to lighten up
on the kids a little bit.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.276
Mine in particular.
- Look, Val,

08:31.278 --> 08:34.079
I respect the fact that
you played a little bit
of pro hockey--

08:34.081 --> 08:38.416
- CWHL. Canadian
Women's Hockey League.
- I know what CWHL is.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.219
- Then you know that you don't
speak to players like that.
At any level.

08:41.221 --> 08:45.657
- You used to be a player
and now you're a mom.

08:45.659 --> 08:49.094
And I refuse to stand here
and be lectured

08:49.096 --> 08:53.398
by someone's mommy.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.501
(grunting)

09:17.190 --> 09:20.125
- Excuse me?

09:20.127 --> 09:23.795
There's a puddle
in the owner's office.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.931
You should clean
that first.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.601
Before he comes in.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.537
- Thank you.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.806
I speak English.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.682
<i> Oba na...</i>

10:02.636 --> 10:06.137
<i> Na--</i>
- No, I insist.
This mess is my fault.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.743
I'm Augustus Nickel.

10:11.745 --> 10:15.914
This is my place.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.316
- I'm... I'm Anna Funk.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.820
- Edentola?
- I was.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.390
Now, my children and I,
we live in town.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.293
- I'm reformed.
My parents left the colony

10:28.295 --> 10:30.662
when I was...

10:30.664 --> 10:33.331
when I was small.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.734
And then my...

10:35.736 --> 10:38.837
my wife passed away and...

10:38.839 --> 10:41.973
a little voice inside my head

10:41.975 --> 10:44.743
started whispering.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.012
- [Augustus to the warehouse.
Augustus to the warehouse.]

10:53.520 --> 10:55.954
- Pleasure to meet you,
Anna Funk.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.032
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad!

11:07.034 --> 11:09.134
- Just need to have
a word with your mom.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.971
- Go wait in the car.

11:12.973 --> 11:17.509
It's not your day.
Why are you here?
- You'd know if you'd responded

11:17.511 --> 11:20.512
to my texts or answered
any of my calls.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.814
I got the job
in California,

11:22.816 --> 11:25.350
so... we have to talk.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.253
- There's nothing to discuss.
We have a custody agreement.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.156
- It has to be revised.
- No, it doesn't.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.324
Congrats on the job.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.833
- So Dad got the job
in California?

11:41.835 --> 11:44.269
- Yeah.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.673
(radio transmissions)

12:01.054 --> 12:05.156
- You punched a coach.
- Yes.
- And why did you punch a coach?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.625
- Were there any
actual eyewitnesses?
- You will apologize

12:07.627 --> 12:09.894
to the coach
or you'll be charged.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.831
If you're charged,
you'll be suspended.
- Okay.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.400
- You were hired
as an accountant.
- I remember.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.769
- Stop punching people.
- I will.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.604
- What the hell
were you thinking?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.406
You're a forensic accountant.
And a police officer.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.946
Oh... Narcotics got a conviction
on a coke dealer in Antioch.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.582
They need a list compile
of all his assets.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.586
I volunteered you,
because<i>that</i>is accounting.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.522
- No, that's making a list.

12:43.196 --> 12:46.865
♪♪♪

13:20.600 --> 13:22.600
- Anna?

13:22.602 --> 13:25.036
- May I have a word?

13:29.042 --> 13:31.643
It has been a year

13:31.645 --> 13:34.445
since we were excommunicated.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.849
You promised that, after
enough time had passed,

13:37.851 --> 13:41.186
I could make my case
why I should return.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.321
Now that my table has been
taken at the market,

13:43.323 --> 13:45.723
I earned even less
than last week.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.126
And last week,
I did not earn enough

13:48.128 --> 13:51.262
to pay the rent and to put
food on the table.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.933
I am asking for the sake
of my children,

13:54.935 --> 13:56.935
not myself.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.938
- Anna, you must understand--

13:59.940 --> 14:02.473
- If Justina Epp is allowed,

14:02.475 --> 14:05.476
after what her husband
and Joey did...

14:05.478 --> 14:08.546
- She was homeless.
Gerry's dead.

14:08.548 --> 14:13.051
Joey's disappeared.
She stays in the spare room.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.620
- We will be homeless soon too.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.089
Please.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.725
For Tina and Isaak.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.166
- I will speak to the elders.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.082
(sawing sound)

14:44.084 --> 14:47.385
- Hey! Hey!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.387
Antioch P...

14:52.092 --> 14:55.660
Detective Gates, Antioch PD.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.330
I'm looking for this guy.
Noah Funk.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.200
May go by another name.

15:06.740 --> 15:11.342
- I've seen him. My cousin
gave him a drive with
a work crew up north.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.611
- Okay, so where's
your cousin now?

15:17.050 --> 15:20.451
Hey!

15:20.453 --> 15:22.553
Oh, don't you dare make me run.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.924
Oh, he's making me run. Hey!

15:25.926 --> 15:28.960
Hey!

15:28.962 --> 15:31.930
I'm not Immigration police!

15:31.932 --> 15:34.299
I just wanna talk!

15:43.510 --> 15:47.278
You gave this guy a ride.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.580
Where'd you leave him?

16:04.364 --> 16:07.565
(city sounds)

16:18.378 --> 16:21.446
- Hello, Jackie.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.948
Okay. Brought you a sandwich.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.718
I know how much you like
peanut butter.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.287
And a bottle of water.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.023
- Noah Funk?

16:32.025 --> 16:34.392
Detective Gates.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.095
I was Detective Novak's partner.
Got a minute?

16:37.097 --> 16:41.099
Your wife's trying
to find you.

16:41.101 --> 16:45.069
I need to know
what to tell her.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.310
How long have you
been here?

16:54.314 --> 16:57.315
After Bronco left, he told me
to keep an eye on your family.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.151
They've had a rough go
without you.

17:00.153 --> 17:03.254
No money, excommunicated
from the colony,

17:03.256 --> 17:06.991
and you... you were what?

17:06.993 --> 17:10.661
Having a gap year?
Why don't you go home?

17:14.267 --> 17:17.168
- I took a life.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.937
- Eli Voss.
- A life.

17:19.939 --> 17:24.008
For what I have done,
God could never forgive me.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.477
And I would follow Voss
straight into hell right now

17:26.479 --> 17:30.148
if taking my own life
didn't offend Him even more.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.884
I need to leave Anna

17:32.886 --> 17:38.456
and the children to find
their own way back to God.
- But here you are.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.826
You could have stayed
in Belize. Why not?

17:41.828 --> 17:46.197
- Because I am weak.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.968
I know I can never
see them again.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.638
I cannot...

17:56.142 --> 18:00.178
I can't be so far away.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.814
Please,

18:02.816 --> 18:06.818
don't tell Anna you found me.

18:06.820 --> 18:10.555
She needs to believe I am dead.

18:10.557 --> 18:15.226
It's the only way she will make
a new life for herself.

18:17.163 --> 18:20.398
It's the kindest thing
you could do.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.872
- So what's the plan now?
Just keep trying to work
yourself to death?

18:27.874 --> 18:30.241
- Yes.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.579
If that is God's will.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.169
- Detective Krochak.
- Detective Lee.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.771
- Boss says you volunteered
to help us with this coke
dealer in Antioch.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.175
I did an inventory of assets
at the time of his arrest,
but the thing is--

19:04.177 --> 19:05.910
- Yeah, got it.
- The thing is,

19:05.912 --> 19:07.745
I found a great deal
of paperwork, but no actual...

19:07.747 --> 19:09.981
- Yeah, OK.
- You know, I can do it myself.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.983
There are some things
I'd like to follow up on.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.887
- I got it.

19:20.293 --> 19:24.195
- Antioch PD, open up!
(knocking)

19:31.538 --> 19:34.672
Wilhelm Klippenstein!

19:34.674 --> 19:39.277
Judge ordered you to report to
the Southwest Detention Centre
two days ago.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.547
I have a warrant
for your arrest.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.885
Hello?

20:00.233 --> 20:02.900
Anybody home?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.847
(water bubbling)

20:22.822 --> 20:24.922
Oh...

20:32.365 --> 20:34.365
Ugh!

20:53.353 --> 20:56.287
- (both): Drop your weapon!
- Drop it! Drop it!

20:56.289 --> 21:01.292
- OPS, Organised Crime!
Drop your weapon!
- Gates, Antioch PD!

21:01.294 --> 21:04.629
(retching)

21:04.631 --> 21:06.330
Ugh!

21:06.332 --> 21:08.899
- What are you doing here?
What was that?

21:08.901 --> 21:12.536
- I got here first, so... Ugh!

21:12.538 --> 21:14.538
My crime scene.

21:14.540 --> 21:19.043
(both retching)

21:21.147 --> 21:24.115
(hubbub)

21:24.117 --> 21:26.751
Thanks.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.120
- You fished that out
of the hot tub, right?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.756
- I called your boss.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.325
You're here to do a proceeds
of crime inventory,

21:34.327 --> 21:36.861
not investigate a homicide,
which this was not.

21:36.863 --> 21:41.699
It's just a drug dealer who
partied way too hard before they
hauled his ass off to prison.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.435
- If there's more to this,
I'd like to help.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.771
- Try calling us first
to let us know you're here,

21:46.773 --> 21:48.873
in our jurisdiction.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.375
- Look, all I'm saying is
we're on the same team. Here.

21:51.377 --> 21:55.513
Take my card. You need my help,
you give me a call.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.381
- Ah, I get it.

21:57.383 --> 21:59.850
You're an accountant.
That was probably the first time

21:59.852 --> 22:02.787
you ever drew your weapon.
Exciting, isn't it?

22:02.789 --> 22:06.891
Now, you can go back
and finish your inventory,

22:06.893 --> 22:09.460
which shouldn't be too hard
because there's nothing there

22:09.462 --> 22:11.829
to inventory. Good day,
Detective Krochak.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.809
- Excuse me?
- Sterling MacKay?
- Yes?

22:24.811 --> 22:27.411
- Detective Gates, Antioch PD.
Got a second?

22:27.413 --> 22:29.480
- I'm in the middle
of meeting with a client.
Who let you in here?

22:29.482 --> 22:32.350
- I apologise for the intrusion.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.719
- Did Rosie let you in?

22:34.721 --> 22:38.856
- Wilhelm Klippenstein.
Name ring a bell?
- No.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.859
- I'd remember a name like that,
I mean, even if I hadn't seen
him turn to soup.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.195
You should too,
since he was a client.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.397
So why would a partner

22:46.399 --> 22:49.700
in this town's biggest law firm
represent a Mennonite
migrant worker?

22:49.702 --> 22:52.603
- Klippenstein. Klippenstein.
That's right. Okay.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.939
Everyone here has to do their
fair share of pro bono work,

22:54.941 --> 22:59.310
and I am no exception. Alright?
Now have a nice day...
- So this tomato picker

22:59.312 --> 23:02.213
is moving cocaine by the kilo,
but his lawyer has
to work for free?

23:02.215 --> 23:05.216
- That's what pro bono means.
For free.

23:05.218 --> 23:09.754
And if I recall, Mr.
Klippenstein wasn't convicted of
trafficking, merely possession.

23:09.756 --> 23:14.792
- Which is why he was able to
get out on bail, to go home to
his mansion and OD in a hot tub.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.261
- You are gonna have to make
an appointment, Detective.

23:17.263 --> 23:21.432
Thank you very much.
- I did. I'll see you
at the station tomorrow.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.573
- Oh, that proceeds
of crime inventory...

23:29.575 --> 23:32.109
- Was unnecessary because
there was nothing in the house?

23:32.111 --> 23:35.679
- Well, except
a dead body by the
name of Wilhelm Klippenstein.

23:35.681 --> 23:39.316
The coroner's saying that--
- Cocaine toxicity causing heart
attack, yeah. I read the report.

23:39.318 --> 23:43.120
- Who was that guy, anyway?
- Mennonite farmhand,
born in Mexico.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.791
- How does a farmhand
afford a house like that?

23:46.793 --> 23:48.759
- By selling large
amounts of cocaine.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.763
- I think you missed something.
- Yes, a trafficking conviction.

23:52.765 --> 23:56.467
- You don't think there's
more to it than that?

23:56.469 --> 24:00.137
Give me what you got on the dead
Mennonite. I'll dig in.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.773
I'll follow the money.
I can help you.

24:13.286 --> 24:16.320
(indistinct conversations)

24:37.143 --> 24:39.143
(sigh)

24:44.851 --> 24:46.851
(sigh)

25:06.973 --> 25:09.340
(gunshot imitation)

25:21.587 --> 25:24.588
(sniffling)
(laughing)

25:28.060 --> 25:31.662
- I'm lying in that quarry,
and the last thing I remember

25:31.664 --> 25:35.866
is you shouting "Abel!"

25:35.868 --> 25:39.603
And the blood is
pouring out of me.

25:39.605 --> 25:43.741
And I look up
and I see God.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.677
And He's...

25:46.679 --> 25:50.114
He's pure... light.

25:52.418 --> 25:55.653
And that light says to me:

25:55.655 --> 25:58.489
"From now on,

25:58.491 --> 26:01.959
"all you have to do is live.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.795
"No guilt,

26:04.797 --> 26:07.364
"no rules.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.968
Just live."

26:10.970 --> 26:14.438
Then everything
went black

26:14.440 --> 26:17.575
and I woke up
in the hospital

26:17.577 --> 26:20.477
with tubes sticking
out of me

26:20.479 --> 26:23.647
and a big nurse telling me
how big my bill was gonna be.

26:23.649 --> 26:26.016
So as soon as the lights
went out...

26:26.018 --> 26:27.918
Boop, boop, boop!
Out come the tubes.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.722
Down the hallway I go,
sneak out the door and...

26:31.724 --> 26:35.159
I have been alive ever since.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.663
I mean...

26:39.665 --> 26:41.966
truly alive.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.868
Picking crops,

26:44.870 --> 26:47.271
sleeping rough,

26:47.273 --> 26:50.474
travelling from Texas to Kansas,

26:50.476 --> 26:52.710
where I found Ezekiel.

26:52.712 --> 26:56.380
Living with relatives.
And he's safe.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.849
He's strong.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.652
Thanks be to God.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.690
Same God that gave me a mission:

27:06.692 --> 27:10.060
to save your skin.

27:10.062 --> 27:14.331
Just like
you saved mine.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.700
Before you, uh,

27:16.702 --> 27:19.970
left me to die in the quarry.

27:23.909 --> 27:27.244
(phones ringing)

27:27.246 --> 27:29.880
- You have an hour.

28:12.625 --> 28:15.259
- Hi.

28:22.635 --> 28:25.502
My divorce settlement
just came in.

28:27.773 --> 28:30.374
I'm so into this whole...

28:30.376 --> 28:32.643
What is this style? It's...

28:32.645 --> 28:34.611
- Wood?

28:36.615 --> 28:39.983
- I was just wondering how much
it might cost to furnish
a whole house.

28:39.985 --> 28:42.319
- I got this, buddy.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.823
So, living room, kitchen,
two, three bedrooms?

28:45.825 --> 28:49.259
- Oh, it's four bedrooms
and a finished basement.
- Okay.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.195
Well, if you'd like
to look at our catalogue,

28:51.197 --> 28:53.163
we can go through a couple of--
- Oh, I have no time.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.733
Just ballpark it for me?

28:55.735 --> 28:58.502
- If I had to guess,

28:58.504 --> 29:01.939
seven rooms fully
furnished... $20,000?

29:01.941 --> 29:06.076
- Well, I'll think about it.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.413
- Okay.

30:53.385 --> 30:57.855
- I offer no excuse
for our wickedness.

30:57.857 --> 31:02.426
We did it not for the money
but because we felt that
we had no other choice.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.995
I think that many
of you here today

31:04.997 --> 31:08.131
can understand that.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.052
- Thank you, Bishop,

32:02.054 --> 32:05.389
for leaving this decision to us.

32:05.391 --> 32:09.793
We felt that the matter
was best decided by those
not so close to the family.

32:09.795 --> 32:12.195
Difficult as it is,

32:12.197 --> 32:16.033
our decision stands. Anna
will remain excommunicated.

32:16.035 --> 32:19.469
Come back in a year.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.372
Maybe hearts will have softened
and memories of your sins

32:22.374 --> 32:25.375
faded by then.
- My sins?

32:25.377 --> 32:30.347
How dare you punish us for doing
what you asked us to do?
What you men

32:30.349 --> 32:33.517
lacked the courage
to do? What?

32:33.519 --> 32:35.686
What more can I lose?

32:35.688 --> 32:38.188
Members of this community
came to my husband

32:38.190 --> 32:41.425
and you begged him to save you,
and God help us,

32:41.427 --> 32:45.495
he was foolish enough to listen.
- We understand why you did it.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.165
It was how you did it.

32:48.167 --> 32:51.234
You took over that filthy
business, built it up,

32:51.236 --> 32:56.206
let no one stand in your way,
not even Gerry Epp.
Perhaps it was

32:56.208 --> 33:00.210
the shame of his arrest
that caused his death.

33:00.212 --> 33:03.180
I can't stop thinking
that it was something else

33:03.182 --> 33:05.449
that led him to the end
of that rope.

33:13.926 --> 33:17.594
- The Pastor has agreed

33:17.596 --> 33:20.998
that Isaak and Tina
can come back,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.201
to my bible studies
class at my house.

33:24.203 --> 33:28.038
If they are serious
about following our ways,

33:28.040 --> 33:30.574
they will be welcomed back.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.343
- But not my mother?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.446
You tell those old Kosse that--
- Isaak!

33:36.448 --> 33:39.216
<i>Jenauch!</i>

33:41.587 --> 33:45.589
<i> Danke schoen.</i>
They will come.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.224
- Good.

34:20.059 --> 34:23.860
- Excuse me. I think
I might be lost.

34:23.862 --> 34:27.264
Can you take a look at
these directions, please?

34:27.266 --> 34:29.599
- Yeah. Sure, no problem.

34:33.672 --> 34:37.441
Alright, where are you
trying to go here?

34:41.346 --> 34:43.947
(faint moans)

35:13.378 --> 35:15.712
- So. I go to these guys
and I say:

35:15.714 --> 35:19.583
"How much to fill my house with
your beautiful furniture?"
- Who?

35:19.585 --> 35:22.986
- "Muhlbach and Moody". The
company on the receipt
you scooped up

35:22.988 --> 35:26.523
when you busted Klippenstein.
$20,000.
- So?

35:26.525 --> 35:30.127
- So, that receipt tells me that
the farmhand in the slow cooker

35:30.129 --> 35:33.797
paid $100,000 for the same
furniture from the same store.

35:33.799 --> 35:38.568
But as you pointed out,
his house was empty.

35:38.570 --> 35:43.106
- So you're saying these guys,
Muhlbach and Moody, are dealers?
- No. I'm saying

35:43.108 --> 35:46.610
that this could be one
of the many businesses
washing cash for them.

35:46.612 --> 35:50.714
- My Sergeant's gonna need more
than an invoice to authorize
a surveillance operation.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.683
(phone ringing)

35:53.685 --> 35:56.052
- Krochak.

35:58.090 --> 36:01.958
(indistinct radio transmissions)

36:01.960 --> 36:03.727
- Looks like a coronary,

36:03.729 --> 36:06.496
but an autopsy will tell.
You guys friends?

36:06.498 --> 36:11.101
- No. We were working together
on a case. Are you sure there
was no sign of a struggle?

36:11.103 --> 36:14.371
- It looks to me like he had
an undiagnosed heart condition

36:14.373 --> 36:18.041
and nature took its course.
Why? Did he have any enemies?

36:18.043 --> 36:22.946
- He was a police officer.
- You know how many cops die
from heart disease every year?

36:22.948 --> 36:27.384
(phone buzzing)
Excuse me. I gotta
take this. Hello?

36:53.111 --> 36:56.613
(dramatic music)

38:14.226 --> 38:17.394
- Noah Funk?

38:17.396 --> 38:21.531
Detective Krochak.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.934
(alarm clock ringing)

38:55.133 --> 38:58.735
- Anna Funk.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.905
I must say I expected someone...

39:01.907 --> 39:06.343
I don't know...

39:26.765 --> 39:29.299
I am Hector Estrada

39:29.301 --> 39:31.968
and I work for
the Norteuo cartel.

39:31.970 --> 39:36.172
A new management position has
opened up, and from what I hear,

39:36.174 --> 39:39.676
nobody ran this end of
the business more profitably

39:39.678 --> 39:42.445
than you did.

39:42.447 --> 39:45.281
- I have a friend.

39:45.283 --> 39:48.852
A policeman.

39:48.854 --> 39:52.522
You need to leave right now.

40:07.406 --> 40:10.173
- You have no friends.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.409
But you have
two children,

40:12.411 --> 40:16.012
and I will take one
as insurance.

40:16.014 --> 40:19.315
And when your work is done,
I will give you your child back.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.818
Either one.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.387
You can choose.

40:27.759 --> 40:31.027
Call the number programmed
in this phone in ten minutes

40:31.029 --> 40:33.163
and we'll make
arrangements.

40:33.165 --> 40:35.899
Or my colleague
will take your kids

40:35.901 --> 40:38.735
and chop them
into pieces so small,

40:38.737 --> 40:42.338
you will need DNA
to identify them.

42:08.293 --> 42:11.394
- I'll see you
in a few hours.

42:27.178 --> 42:30.280
- So it's empty?
Just clean the floors?

42:30.282 --> 42:33.216
