-[Lisa laughs]: I can't believe
we pulled that off.

19:43.792 --> 19:47.041
-I heard Tony and Samuel gave
the performance of a lifetime.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.291
-And you should have seen
everyone's faces.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.458
I mean, I almost felt bad for
them.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.458
-Oh, you shouldn't.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.750
When I heard what they
were going to do to you,
I couldn't go through with it.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.000
Besides, I never liked those
jerks.

19:58.041 --> 20:00.917
-Thanks Peter. So, what's next?

20:00.959 --> 20:03.291
-It's only a good prank if they
think I'm really dead.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.125
-So, I'm moving to New York.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.959
-Really?
-A friend of mine has a lead on
a teaching job there.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.709
Everything's set up.
-That's commitment.

20:13.750 --> 20:16.583
-Come with me.
-Oh no.

20:16.625 --> 20:19.208
No, I can't do that.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.750
-Run away with me.

20:21.792 --> 20:24.291
-No. Sorry.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.500
-Oh, 'cause I thought we
had something.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.250
-Yeah, yeah we have something.

20:29.291 --> 20:32.208
Just not that something.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.875
-I guess I misread the
situation.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.834
-Yeah.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.583
-Well, if you change your
mind...

20:40.625 --> 20:44.125
I'll be at Gate 23,
Terminal C...

20:44.166 --> 20:46.375
9PM tonight.

20:47.625 --> 20:51.125
-Peter, it was really nice
pranking with you.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.458
Thanks.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.542
-I love you.
-Okay.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.083
[Lisa]: Awesome.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.000
Thank you.
