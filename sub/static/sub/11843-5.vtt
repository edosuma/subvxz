It's quite good, Michael.

32:13.562 --> 32:15.621
- It is.
- Thank you.

32:15.698 --> 32:18.065
Don't you think it's time
you drew something else?

32:19.935 --> 32:23.997
- Somethin' else?
- Well, when the class drew fruit...

32:24.073 --> 32:26.007
you drew this.

32:26.075 --> 32:30.512
When the class sketched
a human form, you drew this again.

32:30.579 --> 32:33.276
You're a talented artist,
Mr. Guerin.

32:33.349 --> 32:37.650
But you can't go through the semester
drawing only a geodesic dome.

32:37.720 --> 32:41.020
- A what?
- A geodesic dome?

32:41.090 --> 32:46.654
Perhaps before your time. It's a type
of house, architecturally postmodern.

32:46.729 --> 32:51.189
- <i>House?</i>
- <i>As I was saying, Mr. Guerin...</i>

32:51.267 --> 32:56.068
an artist of your ability can draw
something else, something besides this.

32:56.138 --> 32:59.233
Perhaps-

33:13.455 --> 33:16.425
<i>[ Charcoal Scraping Paper]</i>

33:23.699 --> 33:26.430
Stick with the dome.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.839
<i>[ Max] Michael's painting isn't
our biggest problem right now.</i>

33:36.211 --> 33:39.272
Does that imply that there's
a problem I'm not aware of?

33:42.184 --> 33:46.553
But, before I tell you,
you need to know that...

33:46.622 --> 33:49.614
it's not Liz's fault.

33:49.692 --> 33:53.185
You see, Liz keeps ajournal.
Everything that happens to her...

33:53.262 --> 33:56.596
she writes down-
including that day at the café.

33:56.665 --> 33:59.965
What I did, who I am.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.466
Who you are.

34:03.539 --> 34:05.940
But you can't blame her, all right?
You gotta promise me that.

34:06.008 --> 34:10.809
- Blame her for what?
- For losing herjournal.

34:11.947 --> 34:14.074
<i>- [ Isabel] Oh, my God.
- I know it sounds bad.</i>

34:14.149 --> 34:16.641
But it'll turn up. I know it will.

34:17.753 --> 34:20.745
<i>But until then, I'm handling it.</i>

34:20.822 --> 34:23.656
<i>Michael?
Did you hear what I said?</i>

34:23.726 --> 34:25.922
<i>Michael?</i>

34:26.094 --> 34:29.065
<i>- [ Water Running]
- [ Doorbell jingling]</i>

34:29.130 --> 34:31.623
Sorry, we're closed!

34:33.002 --> 34:35.300
- <i>[ Door Closes, Bell Rings]</i>
- <i>Michael.</i>

34:35.371 --> 34:38.306
Um, I'm sorry that
the kitchen's closed.

34:39.375 --> 34:41.639
That's all right. I just ate.

34:42.878 --> 34:47.246
You know, actually,
this is for employees only.

34:56.091 --> 34:58.321
Max told me what happened.

34:59.895 --> 35:01.829
Oh, he did.

35:03.232 --> 35:05.428
What did he say?

35:05.501 --> 35:07.663
He said you wrote it
all down, Liz.

35:09.905 --> 35:11.896
He said that.

35:19.882 --> 35:22.283
What do you want?

35:26.422 --> 35:29.619
I want you to know it wasn't smart
to write all those things down, Liz.

35:32.094 --> 35:34.586
Yeah. I know that now.

35:35.798 --> 35:37.732
I knew it a week ago.

35:40.536 --> 35:42.868
Excuse me?

35:42.938 --> 35:45.771
That was the night
I sat at the first booth.

35:45.841 --> 35:47.832
Maybe you remember.

35:49.578 --> 35:52.912
<i>[Michael's Voice] It was late, like
tonight. And you were at the counter.</i>

35:52.981 --> 35:54.972
<i>Writing.</i>

35:56.085 --> 36:00.454
- Homework?
- Uh, yeah.

36:00.522 --> 36:03.514
A little bit.

36:08.597 --> 36:10.929
But it wasn't homework, was it?

36:10.999 --> 36:13.263
No, it wasn't.

36:13.335 --> 36:16.032
You could have put us
in an awful spot, Liz.

36:16.105 --> 36:19.336
<i>Roswelfs not exactly the town
you want to be unique in.</i>

36:21.276 --> 36:23.677
If you know what I mean.

36:28.951 --> 36:30.942
You have to know
who your friends are.

36:35.124 --> 36:37.058
I had to know the risk.

36:38.861 --> 36:41.193
Sol had to know
what yourjournal said.

36:41.263 --> 36:44.130
<i>You took it.</i>

36:52.775 --> 36:55.073
I never meant for things
to get out of control.

37:00.883 --> 37:03.147
It's nice to know we have at least
one friend in this town.

37:06.989 --> 37:09.617
- Does Max know that you-
- No.

37:09.691 --> 37:12.592
And you know
what would be really great?

37:12.661 --> 37:15.392
If you didn't tell him.

37:18.901 --> 37:21.495
But why didn't you just
destroy this, Michael?

37:21.570 --> 37:24.904
Because anyone that... found this
would know all about you.

37:24.905 --> 37:24.928
Because anyone that... found this
would know all about you.

37:25.872 --> 37:29.570
No. They'd know all about you, Liz.

37:32.579 --> 37:35.844
Thank you for giving me
one more reason to envy Max Evans.

37:46.326 --> 37:49.091
And you might want to
get better window locks.

I seem to be finding myself here
quite a bit lately.

38:20.894 --> 38:23.693
Well, maybe you'd be
interested in a season pass.

Everything's okay, Max.
I have my journal.

38:38.311 --> 38:41.110
You found it?

38:41.181 --> 38:43.206
Ah, I guess you could say
that it found me.

38:43.283 --> 38:45.945
- [ Sighs]
- I left it at the Crashdown.

38:46.019 --> 38:49.978
- A customer returned it.
- A customer?

38:51.091 --> 38:54.425
A friend. A-A good friend.

38:59.699 --> 39:03.158
Uh, look, Max, now that this
is all over and everything-

39:03.236 --> 39:07.230
I feel like I owe you an explanation
to why I wrote those things.

39:07.307 --> 39:09.071
No. You don't.

39:09.142 --> 39:13.375
No, I know you think that I was foolish,
to write about that day, and you...

39:13.446 --> 39:17.576
and everything, but-

39:17.650 --> 39:21.553
What I wrote in my journal...

39:21.621 --> 39:24.215
it didn't really have
anything to do with science.

39:28.595 --> 39:31.394
Um-

39:31.464 --> 39:34.525
That day that you saved me...

39:34.601 --> 39:39.471
I-I felt something that
I just had to put into words.

39:39.539 --> 39:42.736
So years from now,
if anyone ever--

39:42.809 --> 39:45.369
lfanyone ever touches me
the way that you did...

39:48.348 --> 39:51.283
I'll know what it's
supposed to feel like.

39:59.292 --> 40:03.991
So, can I see it?
What you wrote?

40:04.064 --> 40:09.230
Oh. Yeah, I don't-l don't think
that's a good idea.

40:09.302 --> 40:12.670
- No?
- No.

40:12.739 --> 40:14.935
Why?

40:15.008 --> 40:18.239
Because if I read what
you wrote in yourjournal...

40:22.048 --> 40:25.143
I realize how
you really see me.

40:28.021 --> 40:30.183
Exactly.

40:40.834 --> 40:42.768
I can't believe
