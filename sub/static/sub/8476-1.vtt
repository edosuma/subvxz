01:03.761 --> 01:06.095
Usually when I walk ...

01:06.129 --> 01:09.674
night or, well, being alone,

01:09.712 --> 01:11.599
if I feel fear o. ..

01:11.632 --> 01:13.486
Then he appears.

01:13.519 --> 01:16.137
She tells me about what I do,
I advised

01:16.175 --> 01:18.509
saying, "Do not be afraid.

01:18.543 --> 01:21.608
"At night walk
in the middle of the street. "

01:21.646 --> 01:23.021
And I do.

01:23.054 --> 01:25.225
Road in the middle of the street.

01:25.261 --> 01:27.683
Or, I dunno, say something like ...

01:28.653 --> 01:31.303
"It's an embarrassment.
This street is an embarrassment.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.933
"Lighting is very poor.
Did you write?

01:32.972 --> 01:35.175
"You write."

01:35.212 --> 01:37.121
The always straightforward.

01:37.163 --> 01:40.839
I mean, always was.
I guess that is not ...

01:40.875 --> 01:44.420
But you know, too
I spoke in Spanish.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.240
Something strange because
he could not speak Spanish.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.589
And when I feel sluggish,

01:50.633 --> 01:53.862
very lonely and hopeless ...

01:53.896 --> 01:55.238
he appears ...

01:55.272 --> 01:56.799
their presence.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.490
And nothing happens, fine.

01:59.528 --> 02:01.731
And he says he loves me ...

02:04.294 --> 02:06.498
and then is gone.

02:07.558 --> 02:09.565
And how you feel then?

02:10.949 --> 02:12.892
Well, fine.

02:12.933 --> 02:16.249
I am careful, I suppose,

02:16.293 --> 02:17.503
protected.

02:18.981 --> 02:21.762
He never says anything profound,
nothing shocking.

02:21.796 --> 02:25.144
He does not say,
"God thinks such a thing" or ...

02:26.339 --> 02:29.470
Not to mention the planet or
of world events ...

02:29.506 --> 02:31.775
nor does it say, "No God."

02:31.810 --> 02:34.941
It is always, "Lie down,
brush your teeth. "

02:34.978 --> 02:37.116
Cepillármelos Either way,

02:37.153 --> 02:39.422
because the brush always
horizontally ...

02:39.456 --> 02:42.173
and when I do, he says,
"From top to bottom.

02:42.208 --> 02:45.786
"Come on up and down,
bottom-up ".

02:45.823 --> 02:48.573
O. .. "Close the back door."

02:51.551 --> 02:52.892
How can he say?

02:53.791 --> 02:55.317
Close the back door.

02:55.358 --> 02:59.699
Do you think it is important
you say it in Spanish?

03:07.004 --> 03:08.727
I already did.

03:08.764 --> 03:09.811
Is closed.

03:12.028 --> 03:14.416
How long has Jamie died?

03:18.362 --> 03:19.310
Nina?

03:21.849 --> 03:25.165
Jamie ... When did he?

04:04.722 --> 04:10.863
REAL, CRAZY AND DEEPLY

06:08.541 --> 06:10.645
"Good evening.
"So long, Carolyn.

06:10.685 --> 06:12.277
"Until tomorrow.
"Good evening.

06:14.524 --> 06:17.273
"Good evening, Sandy.
"Bye, Carolyn.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.504
I love your hair.

06:28.570 --> 06:32.017
- What?
"Your hair ... looks, I know ...

06:32.057 --> 06:33.999
Have you done anything differently?

06:34.041 --> 06:36.015
Or are the earrings?
They are beautiful.

06:36.057 --> 06:37.366
They look something ...

06:37.400 --> 06:38.960
They appear to be Incan.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.388
Sandy, what
are you talking about?

06:41.431 --> 06:42.675
Are you depressed?

06:44.759 --> 06:47.987
I do not want only
because you translate my post.

06:48.023 --> 06:49.516
I know.

06:49.558 --> 06:52.906
We are all somewhat
worried about you.

06:52.949 --> 06:54.127
Who are "all"?

06:54.165 --> 06:56.685
Because you've gone.
You hide.

06:56.725 --> 06:59.059
I do not go, nor invite anyone.

06:59.093 --> 07:01.002
"You look terrible.
"Except my hair.

07:01.044 --> 07:05.648
Well, actually, you know, your hair
was never your forte either.

07:05.683 --> 07:07.471
Is it still Jamie, then?

07:07.507 --> 07:09.678
- What ... Why?
"I understand.

07:09.714 --> 07:11.721
God knows how
Gabriela strange.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.420
I hated it, but I miss her.

07:13.458 --> 07:16.457
I understand,
but you need to leave.

07:16.497 --> 07:19.082
Please salts,
ever meet anyone.

07:19.121 --> 07:21.706
Well ... well, honey, thanks.

07:21.744 --> 07:24.133
Take a sip
to Uncle Sandy.

07:24.176 --> 07:26.216
Sandy, I can not.

07:26.256 --> 07:27.401
I can not.

07:32.654 --> 07:34.083
I simply can not.

07:42.477 --> 07:43.426
Hello.

07:44.237 --> 07:45.513
Is everything OK?

07:47.820 --> 07:49.096
Okay safe now.

07:49.132 --> 07:51.750
I am much happier
with the door.

07:53.964 --> 07:55.458
Would take 10 man lying.

07:55.499 --> 07:57.637
Titus, it's almost midnight.

07:57.674 --> 08:01.536
Yes, I came to see if they still
I need the morning.

08:01.578 --> 08:04.545
Ah, yes, indeed,
need you, please.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.781
The closet doors
do not close the kitchen.

08:14.568 --> 08:17.863
And, of Titus, hey, I have rats.

08:17.895 --> 08:21.026
I or two giant rats
they never stop eating ...

08:21.062 --> 08:22.972
or 2,000 on a diet.

08:23.015 --> 08:25.884
A man put enough today
poison to kill ...

08:25.926 --> 08:29.308
half the population
North London ...

08:29.349 --> 08:31.072
and is disappearing, look.

08:31.109 --> 08:32.832
I miss Poland.

08:34.308 --> 08:35.388
Clear.

08:35.428 --> 08:37.730
Sometimes I think
I hate to Poland,

08:37.764 --> 08:42.236
but then I remember some
song or music, or taste ...

08:42.275 --> 08:44.860
I remember the taste
Polish bread.

08:46.338 --> 08:48.858
The man should not drink
because it overcomes ...

08:48.898 --> 08:52.792
nostalgia for their homeland,
by his mother and his mistresses.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.742
Yes, go to bed.

08:55.777 --> 08:59.038
I'm exhausted.
I've had a busy day.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.021
Nina ...

09:01.055 --> 09:05.081
You're the only pretty woman
I have met in London.

09:05.119 --> 09:07.126
You're absolutely right.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.923
It has nothing to do
with drinking.

09:08.958 --> 09:11.860
I am the only
beautiful woman in London.

09:13.374 --> 09:14.803
Good night.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.602
See you in the morning.

09:19.356 --> 09:21.658
In my country ...

09:21.692 --> 09:23.928
when we want
eliminate the rats ...

09:23.964 --> 09:25.851
do not use poison.

09:25.884 --> 09:27.639
Bailamos.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.683
To flee
rats, we ...

09:29.723 --> 09:31.249
we dance.

09:47.448 --> 09:50.927
I would be surprised
if the rats return.

10:05.268 --> 10:08.945
Oh, my God.

10:46.574 --> 10:49.803
Excuse me, are you Nina?

10:49.837 --> 10:51.779
"At the bottom.
"Thanks.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.169
- Nina?
-Sandy.

10:57.772 --> 10:58.982
What happens here?.

11:00.683 --> 11:04.512
The refrigerator still works
and fish remains frozen.

11:04.555 --> 11:08.548
Wow, Nina,
this apartment is not very ...

11:08.586 --> 11:09.862
Not really.

11:09.898 --> 11:11.872
Who's the guy on the rafter?

11:11.913 --> 11:15.077
Keith, the plumber,
plumber for the environment.

11:15.113 --> 11:16.869
We have water problems.

11:16.904 --> 11:19.838
Titus tries to adjust
the closet doors.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.440
Did you know Titus?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.690
Titus!

11:22.728 --> 11:24.800
This is Sandy.
Sandy manages the agency.

11:24.839 --> 11:27.010
Hello, Titus, good job.

11:27.047 --> 11:29.764
George is here. George?

11:30.790 --> 11:33.757
This place is a disaster
it breaks down.

11:33.798 --> 11:36.961
Why I bought it, Sandy?
You warn me.

11:36.998 --> 11:39.234
Jamie too.
All I was warned.

11:39.269 --> 11:41.473
Nina, this is very important.

11:41.508 --> 11:44.737
"Hello.
"George, it is Sandy, my boss.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.844
- Have you addressed these containers?
-No.

11:46.884 --> 11:49.665
- Have not you cast?
-No.

11:49.699 --> 11:51.902
Got a problem
very seriously, Nina.

11:51.939 --> 11:54.142
You have an infestation
Rodents,

11:54.179 --> 11:55.607
perhaps even nests.

11:55.650 --> 11:57.821
Can I use your phone?

11:57.858 --> 11:59.199
Got mice?

12:01.953 --> 12:04.822
- Rats? My goodness.
"I have to move.

12:04.864 --> 12:06.522
Sandy ...

12:06.560 --> 12:07.639
Do you want "borscht"?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.021
How?

12:09.056 --> 12:11.870
"Borscht", try it.
Titus believes that solves everything.

12:11.904 --> 12:13.943
Ah, "borscht" Yes, thank you.

12:13.982 --> 12:17.178
Nina, I have buried here
a postcard from Charlie.

12:17.215 --> 12:18.360
Got a minute?

12:18.398 --> 12:21.212
Sandy, you
to learn Spanish.

12:21.246 --> 12:23.482
It is perverse given
agency languages ...

12:23.518 --> 12:25.884
How many languages do you speak?
And no power ...

12:25.917 --> 12:29.080
Is your son. You should be able
understand what he says.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.538
The same problem
you had with Gabriela.

12:31.580 --> 12:34.132
"They could not understand.
"Then it was phenomenal.

12:34.172 --> 12:36.593
Just to begin to communicate
We disconnected.

12:36.635 --> 12:39.537
It was great when we
understood by signs.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.714
Weakling.

12:41.754 --> 12:44.340
- What is this?
-Urgent job for you,

12:44.378 --> 12:47.411
manuals and other things,
but first the postcard.

12:47.449 --> 12:50.798
Read me the postcard, or I'll
an anxiety attack.

12:52.569 --> 12:54.772
- "Dear Dad ..."
- Where does it say that?

12:57.143 --> 12:59.053
Fantastic.

12:59.095 --> 13:02.029
"We spent the holidays
in Mar del Plata.

13:02.071 --> 13:05.387
How charming.
I hear it's beautiful.

13:05.430 --> 13:09.226
"Swimming in the sea
and I'm not using ... "

13:10.198 --> 13:11.790
What do you call ...?

13:11.829 --> 13:14.195
- "I'm not using ..."
- Bathing suit?

13:14.229 --> 13:15.177
Buoys.

13:15.988 --> 13:19.217
"Mario teaches me to swim
under water.

13:19.251 --> 13:21.226
The son of a bitch.
- "We were ...

13:21.268 --> 13:23.788
"in a large hotel
that has a television ...

13:23.827 --> 13:25.420
"in the bathroom.

13:25.459 --> 13:28.176
Sounds like Gabriela,
TV in the bathroom.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.217
Do not you feel like laughing?

13:30.258 --> 13:33.902
Both criticize the materialism
to bathe in luxury.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.872
"Last night we went to
a football game and then ...

13:36.913 --> 13:39.760
"We did a barbecue
that gave me diarrhea. "

13:39.792 --> 13:40.872
That's terrible.

13:40.912 --> 13:43.694
Because Mario is,
no doubt possible

13:43.728 --> 13:47.556
a bastard irredeemable that
and stepfather, what does?

13:47.599 --> 13:48.842
It poisons my son.

13:48.879 --> 13:51.431
"I'm enjoying myself very much.
Wish you were here.

13:51.471 --> 13:53.063
"With much love, Charlie".

13:57.965 --> 13:59.907
What is going great.

14:01.484 --> 14:05.510
I have to answer, Nina.
Will you help me write?

14:05.548 --> 14:08.809
Sandy, if you promise to do
the effort to learn Spanish.

14:12.298 --> 14:13.443
You're a good person.

14:14.474 --> 14:15.652
How's the soup?

14:15.690 --> 14:17.097
"Fantastic?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.868
"It's fantastic.
-Fantastic.

14:20.905 --> 14:22.531
I said last night ...

14:22.569 --> 14:25.318
that is a very pretty woman.

14:25.353 --> 14:27.141
It's very pretty.

14:27.176 --> 14:28.125
You are.

14:29.512 --> 14:31.399
I think it's beautiful.

14:31.432 --> 14:32.861
Who is the beautiful?

14:32.904 --> 14:34.692
We talked about Nina.

14:34.727 --> 14:36.003
Yes it is.

14:36.038 --> 14:37.761
Come on, what's this?

14:48.293 --> 14:50.202
She loved him intensely.

14:50.244 --> 14:51.192
It's tragic.

14:52.548 --> 14:55.166
He was young, younger than me.

14:55.203 --> 14:57.342
It is cruel and hard.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.060
He had a sore throat.

15:00.098 --> 15:02.815
Then,
are examining what y. ..

15:02.850 --> 15:04.192
suddenly stopped breathing.

15:04.226 --> 15:06.528
The anesthetist
meterle the tube failed.

15:06.561 --> 15:09.528
With a cough lozenge,
not have happened.

15:10.592 --> 15:12.567
I think she likes me.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.989
I know I still do not know, but ...

15:18.624 --> 15:19.933
Do you like washing?

15:19.967 --> 15:23.131
Yes, I like to put
hands in warm water.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.377
I like dry.

15:24.415 --> 15:27.262
"Me too.
"Me too.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.203
Watch this water comes out brown.

15:30.174 --> 15:32.508
It's a miracle
we have some water.

15:32.541 --> 15:34.548
This apartment is
in very poor conditions.

15:43.387 --> 15:48.121
Or I find myself sitting
his head in my hands ...

15:50.394 --> 15:53.939
and an hour or more
has gone well.

15:55.577 --> 15:57.202
And I'm
completely numb.

16:02.232 --> 16:04.882
The kettle can
boil indefinitely ...

16:04.920 --> 16:06.228
or the phone ring ...

16:14.102 --> 16:15.857
and I'm crying.

16:15.894 --> 16:18.676
If someone watching television
says, "What's wrong with you ?"...

16:18.709 --> 16:20.749
It makes me tear. It's ridiculous.

16:25.140 --> 16:26.733
Strangely,
simply bizarre.

16:26.772 --> 16:28.943
The strange, strange,
I miss him.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.987
I know I should do this.

16:40.817 --> 16:44.842
In the room I feel I do not want
bed because he is not.

16:44.881 --> 16:48.011
And I do not want to wake up
get out of bed.

16:53.103 --> 16:55.437
It is anger, right?
It is anger, rage!

16:55.471 --> 16:58.885
And I'm furious with other people,
with love, disenchanted ...

16:58.926 --> 17:01.959
and people love wasting
and women with children,

17:01.998 --> 17:04.233
children who are
growing, fertile!

17:04.269 --> 17:07.171
But above all,
I am so angry with him!

17:09.579 --> 17:11.468
I'm so mad at him!

17:15.468 --> 17:18.762
I can not forgive
for not being here, I can not.

17:51.973 --> 17:55.421
Ah, I've spent my time.

17:55.461 --> 17:56.475
Sorry.

17:59.876 --> 18:02.298
In fact, I'm fine.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.387
I'm fine.

18:08.674 --> 18:11.259
God, I'm late.
Listen ...

18:11.298 --> 18:14.145
Until next Tuesday.
Thank you.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.322
May I?

18:19.425 --> 18:20.373
Bye.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.297
-Walk.
"Yes, walk.

18:26.336 --> 18:29.085
"We're looking at things.
"We're looking at.

18:30.207 --> 18:33.206
"Say it.
"We're looking at things.

18:35.102 --> 18:37.207
"Y. .. What things can we do?

18:37.246 --> 18:38.871
Well, we can see ...

18:39.837 --> 18:42.520
- Trees?
"Well, we can see trees.

18:44.508 --> 18:47.159
"People.
"Yes, we can see some people.

18:47.196 --> 18:49.367
We can see some people.

18:49.403 --> 18:50.897
We can see ... "heaven".

18:53.947 --> 18:56.630
- Heaven!
"Okay.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.804
We can see heaven y. ..

19:06.489 --> 19:09.522
"Clouds.
"Yes, yes, Maura.

19:10.936 --> 19:13.172
We can see the clouds
in heaven.

19:27.797 --> 19:29.487
What are you doing?

19:29.525 --> 19:31.281
No problem.

19:31.316 --> 19:33.356
We gossip
while we clean.

19:33.396 --> 19:34.639
Claire ...

19:34.676 --> 19:39.050
I have plumbers who will return,
carpenters, exterminators ...

19:39.092 --> 19:42.320
and now sinking
One wall of support.

19:43.635 --> 19:45.423
Cleaning is difficult.

19:45.458 --> 19:48.393
Vacuum the dust will not hurt.
Let me do it.

19:48.434 --> 19:50.703
I enjoy cleaning.

19:50.737 --> 19:53.835
-Just like Mom.
- Not true, shut up!

19:53.873 --> 19:57.484
You like to mess
and I like clean.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.065
You should let me help you more.

20:01.104 --> 20:04.070
"I could pass this y. ..
"No thanks.

20:07.119 --> 20:09.006
Harry, what are you doing?

20:12.205 --> 20:14.856
That's rat poison.
Harry, is poison!

20:14.893 --> 20:15.908
God!

20:16.877 --> 20:19.659
Did you eat any of that?
What's in your mouth?

20:19.692 --> 20:21.699
- Spit!
- OK, it's chocolate!

20:21.740 --> 20:23.266
The venom is purple.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.528
God, it's my fault.

20:26.571 --> 20:28.131
Sit.

20:30.026 --> 20:33.190
Sit down, by God,
and try not to ...!

20:35.210 --> 20:36.158
He is impossible.

20:38.025 --> 20:39.235
But what you want.

20:40.201 --> 20:43.496
I want it, but it is impossible.

20:43.528 --> 20:46.015
I do not always.

20:46.056 --> 20:49.438
Try not to poison
for 5 minutes.

20:52.454 --> 20:53.883
Nina ...

20:58.086 --> 21:00.507
How can you have rats?

21:01.509 --> 21:03.297
A defect in my personality.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.155
Seriously.

21:05.188 --> 21:06.682
Do not talk, Claire.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.928
I've tried,
but do not answer.

21:08.964 --> 21:10.174
"What are they doing here?."

21:11.139 --> 21:12.066
Nothing.

21:12.099 --> 21:16.255
Something smells bad.
There is a strange smell.

21:16.290 --> 21:17.697
Even Harry noticed.

21:17.730 --> 21:19.835
The rats are
dying, Claire.

21:19.874 --> 21:22.208
That is the source of the odor.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.167
Why do not you stay
with us?

21:28.257 --> 21:32.151
You could hire repairers
get it fixed properly.

21:32.192 --> 21:33.501
Or sell it.

21:35.487 --> 21:39.098
I'm disgusted to live here
all alone.

21:39.134 --> 21:40.345
I'm fine.

21:41.310 --> 21:43.677
Jamie never lived here.

21:43.710 --> 21:45.498
It has to do with Jamie.

21:49.661 --> 21:50.643
How is Nick?

21:51.837 --> 21:53.909
He's busy.

21:53.948 --> 21:55.442
You know what Everest?

21:55.484 --> 21:58.167
Daddy is going to climb
Everest peak.

21:58.204 --> 22:00.658
Are they kidding? When?

22:00.699 --> 22:02.640
At some point
after Christmas.

22:03.642 --> 22:05.016
When is the baby?

22:05.050 --> 22:07.733
The baby will be several months
then.

22:07.769 --> 22:09.460
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

22:10.425 --> 22:12.313
Probably not.
Anyway ...

22:12.345 --> 22:14.232
he is incompetent
with babies.

22:17.368 --> 22:20.269
I can not sell the apartment.
Nobody is buying.

22:20.311 --> 22:23.093
Only a fool would buy it,
and anyway ...

22:23.127 --> 22:24.501
I like it.

22:26.518 --> 22:27.947
I like it.

22:32.725 --> 22:36.020
"I like it.
"Bravo, Harry is like.

22:36.053 --> 22:37.940
It's big.

22:37.973 --> 22:38.955
And you too.

22:40.853 --> 22:42.794
How do you feel about the baby?

22:42.836 --> 22:44.144
I do not mind.

22:45.396 --> 22:47.250
You look fabulous.

22:48.275 --> 22:50.860
- What about school?
"I worry that will not fit ...

22:50.899 --> 22:52.721
the four in our bed.

22:52.754 --> 22:56.976
Sure, if you push.
The trick is to use the elbow.

22:57.010 --> 22:59.791
Has brilliantly
and enjoys school.

22:59.825 --> 23:03.120
"You're acomodándote in luxury.
-No.

23:03.152 --> 23:04.265
Well.

23:04.304 --> 23:07.238
Say "back" and "Trotsky"
daily before meals.

23:07.279 --> 23:09.068
Do not.

23:10.479 --> 23:12.934
Did you tell Nina
your lessons?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.862
Is taking
cello lessons.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.553
Really?

23:16.590 --> 23:18.793
Is not it great?

23:18.830 --> 23:21.677
- Are not you going to ask Nina?
"Ask yourself.

23:21.709 --> 23:22.756
"Ask what?

23:23.885 --> 23:25.673
Well, Harry was wondering ...

23:25.709 --> 23:28.523
She is taking lessons y. ..

23:28.556 --> 23:32.003
at some point ... school
provides them with instruments ...

23:32.043 --> 23:36.418
to see whether they will continue
serious consideration.

23:36.459 --> 23:39.557
But eventually need
his own cello.

23:39.594 --> 23:41.350
Yes, what are you going?

23:41.386 --> 23:43.873
Well, tell me if bad idea.

23:43.913 --> 23:46.913
But we wondered
if the cello Jamie ...

23:46.953 --> 23:48.960
Is that bad idea?

23:49.001 --> 23:50.943
You do not touch and maybe ...

23:53.032 --> 23:55.236
You want the cello Jamie?

23:55.271 --> 23:59.777
Not as a gift, it would be for
Harry will borrow ...

23:59.815 --> 24:01.189
or we could buy it for you.

24:01.223 --> 24:04.703
Do you have any idea
the value of that cello?

24:04.742 --> 24:07.360
Of course I know
that is a good one.

24:09.925 --> 24:12.193
I can not believe
you're so insensitive.

24:13.636 --> 24:15.938
It is practically
all I have of him.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.044
It's him.

24:19.139 --> 24:20.514
The same.

24:21.475 --> 24:23.297
It's like asking me his corpse.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.697
Nina, not true.

24:25.731 --> 24:27.421
Well, I would not give.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.213
Well, sorry.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.478
"You're right, it was stupid ...
"You should not ever ask.

24:33.569 --> 24:35.957
It's so horrible.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.066
I did not anticipate that
react well, Nina.

28:25.530 --> 28:27.537
I kept thinking ...

28:27.577 --> 28:30.260
"How lucky I,

28:30.296 --> 28:32.205
"die of a sore throat.

28:34.232 --> 28:35.758
But to die ...

28:36.984 --> 28:39.220
the experience of dying,
How come?

28:39.255 --> 28:43.183
Dying was easy, so I do not
like was the general anesthesia.

28:44.214 --> 28:46.483
"I'm serious.
"Me too.

28:48.054 --> 28:49.810
I do not know ...

28:49.845 --> 28:53.674
perhaps I did not die properly
and that is why I return.

28:56.340 --> 28:57.289
I do not know.

29:00.723 --> 29:04.072
It was like standing
behind a glass wall ...

29:04.115 --> 29:05.937
while others
I missed.

29:07.858 --> 29:09.352
It did not hurt.

29:09.394 --> 29:12.524
And you know I'm
rather sensitive to pain.

29:12.562 --> 29:14.220
It did not hurt anything.

29:19.152 --> 29:20.526
But where are you going?

29:22.448 --> 29:23.396
I mean ...

29:26.512 --> 29:29.380
Are you going to Heaven o. .. or what?

29:32.238 --> 29:33.645
I think not.

29:37.774 --> 29:39.813
I do not know how to absorb all this.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.026
Where do I start?

29:55.498 --> 29:57.767
Are you here?. Yes, you are.

29:57.802 --> 29:59.557
I'm here.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.604
Are you staying?

30:07.016 --> 30:08.805
Well, I think so.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.807
I would like. Is this OK?

30:17.190 --> 30:19.099
It's great.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.250
Can I kiss?

30:29.093 --> 30:30.041
Yes

30:48.865 --> 30:51.166
Your lips are a little cold.

30:51.201 --> 30:53.469
In fact, I
fantastic cold.

30:53.505 --> 30:56.733
Yes I feel that this apartment
is like a refrigerator.

30:56.768 --> 30:59.189
The heating is,
or should be working.

30:59.231 --> 31:01.019
I tell you ...

31:01.055 --> 31:03.356
this apartment is terrible.

31:03.391 --> 31:05.529
"I know.
-Malísimo.

31:06.590 --> 31:09.371
Honestly, Nina,
you are absolutely incurable.

31:09.406 --> 31:12.024
And another thing that bothers me ...

31:12.061 --> 31:15.224
're behind in your bills
gas and telephone.

31:15.261 --> 31:17.170
"It's not smart.
"I know.

31:18.076 --> 31:20.018
And never assert
the back door.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.961
"She's crazy.
"Now I will not.

31:57.494 --> 31:59.119
Thanks for strangers.

32:00.117 --> 32:01.873
I missed you, I miss you ...

32:03.413 --> 32:04.656
I missed you.

32:06.580 --> 32:07.660
I know.

32:10.323 --> 32:12.462
But the pain, your pain.

32:13.715 --> 32:15.176
I could not stand it.

32:17.554 --> 32:19.496
There is a girl.

32:20.786 --> 32:23.884
I see this little girl
occasionally.

32:23.921 --> 32:26.157
Alice, who is 3 years.

32:26.193 --> 32:29.902
Three and a half and is charming.
Everyone loves her and pampered.

32:29.936 --> 32:34.027
But it is spoiled,
was not consensual.

32:34.063 --> 32:37.412
She died of a stroke.

32:37.455 --> 32:42.091
And her parents, relatives and their
kindergarten friends ...

32:42.125 --> 32:43.816
She went to a park ...

32:44.942 --> 32:47.625
and told me ...

32:47.661 --> 32:49.603
made an area in the park.

32:50.892 --> 32:53.827
They donated money for swings
and wooden animals.

32:55.340 --> 32:59.779
And there are plaques on the swings ...

32:59.819 --> 33:02.207
and stomach of the horse ...

33:02.250 --> 33:04.519
"In Alice's parents,

33:04.554 --> 33:07.652
"lovingly commemorating
Alice, who used to play here. "

33:09.194 --> 33:11.103
And Alice returns
the place continuously.

33:12.969 --> 33:14.878
When you see your parents ...

33:15.976 --> 33:18.114
raising the boys
the swing ...

33:19.463 --> 33:21.088
and see the board ...

33:22.183 --> 33:26.819
and then hold the child
or daughter so closely ...

33:28.230 --> 33:30.881
as who they are
holding life itself.

33:32.709 --> 33:36.189
And the ability of people
have to love ...

33:38.180 --> 33:39.674
Where are you going?

33:39.716 --> 33:40.926
I do not know.

33:41.891 --> 33:43.451
I blame the government.

33:43.492 --> 33:45.946
- What?
"The government.

33:45.987 --> 33:48.026
What has the government to do?

33:48.067 --> 33:50.303
I hate the bastards.

33:50.338 --> 33:53.185
"Even in death you still pending
party politics?

33:53.218 --> 33:55.421
Still attend the meetings.

33:55.458 --> 33:56.886
Jesus Christ.

33:56.929 --> 34:00.125
It's more than I can
some people say.

34:04.384 --> 34:05.627
Knock on my door.

34:05.664 --> 34:08.248
It is rather late,
Are you expecting someone?

34:08.286 --> 34:09.235
No.

34:10.942 --> 34:12.632
I will muddle through.

34:14.909 --> 34:16.632
I made a decision.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.524
Come to Paris.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.596
Let's make love for a week.

34:22.364 --> 34:23.542
Titus.

34:24.315 --> 34:26.868
You are fabulous and sweet.

34:29.916 --> 34:32.054
Titus, I can not
go to Paris with you.

34:32.091 --> 34:33.684
Wow.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.688
Why ... you do not like Paris?

34:36.731 --> 34:38.257
Do not you want to make love?

34:38.297 --> 34:41.396
Why a week?
No. No, I love Paris.

34:42.521 --> 34:45.303
It has to do with
your invitation, which is nice.

34:47.193 --> 34:49.559
It's more than kind,
is charming.

34:49.592 --> 34:52.242
I just do not
looking lover.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.451
It's not your fault.
It would be like with anyone.

34:54.487 --> 34:56.080
- Can I come?
-No.

34:56.119 --> 34:58.769
"Just to talk.
-No.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.083
It's too late.

35:03.221 --> 35:04.945
Now I'm depressed.

35:04.982 --> 35:06.443
Sorry.

35:06.485 --> 35:08.754
I bought tickets.

35:08.789 --> 35:12.978
I am a man of great emotion
with a big heart.

35:13.013 --> 35:14.190
I know, Titus.

35:15.443 --> 35:16.588
Thank you.

35:17.939 --> 35:18.888
Well ...

35:23.858 --> 35:24.938
I love you.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.238
You follow me?

35:29.233 --> 35:30.215
I follow.

35:38.768 --> 35:39.716
Jamie.

35:54.093 --> 35:55.980
Jamie, please, where are you?

36:01.515 --> 36:03.403
Jamie, please return.

36:17.066 --> 36:18.592
Who was that?

36:25.511 --> 36:27.333
Is this your special trick?

36:27.368 --> 36:29.604
It sounded a man's voice.

36:29.639 --> 36:31.133
Titus ...

36:31.174 --> 36:32.352
It was Titus.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.212
Do not worry.

36:34.247 --> 36:35.872
It's Polish.

36:35.910 --> 36:39.226
"A little late to visit.
"That's what I said.

36:40.710 --> 36:42.018
So ...

36:42.053 --> 36:43.875
What?

36:43.908 --> 36:45.534
Are you in love with you?

36:45.572 --> 36:47.360
I think not, no.

36:52.515 --> 36:53.693
Honey?

36:54.947 --> 36:55.961
What are you doing?

36:58.818 --> 37:00.312
I heat up the lips.

37:22.686 --> 37:25.053
Your mother.

37:25.085 --> 37:27.060
You always say that the clouds.

37:27.101 --> 37:29.402
Sounds like your mother. Look ...

37:29.437 --> 37:30.931
eyes ...

37:30.973 --> 37:33.209
nose, eyebrows ...

37:33.245 --> 37:36.059
"Brilliant.
"My mother has no beard.

37:39.035 --> 37:40.944
Well, I think it could be ...

37:42.523 --> 37:44.083
flyers.

38:01.592 --> 38:04.690
You are in my blood as

38:04.726 --> 38:08.021
The sacred wine

38:08.055 --> 38:11.054
Your taste is so bitter

38:11.093 --> 38:12.370
Bitter and sweet

38:12.405 --> 38:14.794
And so sweet that I

38:14.837 --> 38:19.179
Could you drink boxes of

38:21.524 --> 38:23.695
My love

38:23.731 --> 38:28.302
And yet

38:28.339 --> 38:36.815
I keep up

38:40.081 --> 38:41.161
I love you.

38:43.313 --> 38:44.490
I love you.

38:46.480 --> 38:50.057
I do really love you.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.128
"I love you truly.
"Real, true and madly.

38:53.167 --> 38:54.541
Real, real, crazy,
deeply.

38:54.575 --> 38:57.095
I love you really, truly, crazy,
deeply and passionately.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.043
Real, real, crazy,
deep, passionate ...

38:59.085 --> 39:00.329
and dramatically.

39:00.365 --> 39:02.569
I love you really, truly, crazy,
deep, passionate,

39:02.605 --> 39:04.612
extraordinary ...

39:08.812 --> 39:10.056
deliciously.

39:10.092 --> 39:13.059
I love you really, truly, crazy,

39:13.099 --> 39:16.394
passionate, extraordinary
jugosamente delicious.

39:16.427 --> 39:17.670
Deeply.

39:17.707 --> 39:18.754
Deeply!

39:18.794 --> 39:20.866
You jumped "deep"
that was your word.

39:20.905 --> 39:23.327
This indicates that the felt.

39:23.370 --> 39:24.744
You're a phoney ...

39:27.784 --> 39:30.151
You are probably
a figment of my imagination.

39:31.112 --> 39:32.355
Jugosamente.

39:34.632 --> 39:35.809
Fine for you.

39:38.951 --> 39:40.892
You touch that I dance.

40:02.563 --> 40:06.621
Solitude

40:06.658 --> 40:09.407
It is the coat you're wearing

40:09.442 --> 40:11.580
Jamie, love

40:11.618 --> 40:14.039
A deep blue tone

40:15.713 --> 40:19.771
It is always present

40:21.472 --> 40:25.781
The sun does not shine more

40:25.822 --> 40:29.815
The moon will not rise to the sky

40:29.854 --> 40:35.418
Tears continuously
eyes are overwhelming

40:35.453 --> 40:41.049
When you have love

40:41.084 --> 40:45.044
My darling

40:46.012 --> 40:48.248
- Lsadora!
"The vacuum

40:50.490 --> 40:52.792
It's where you

40:52.826 --> 40:55.411
Jamie, love

40:55.450 --> 40:57.686
With nothing left to lose

40:57.721 --> 41:02.358
And nothing more to gain

41:02.393 --> 41:06.833
He just will not shine more

41:06.872 --> 41:11.126
The moon will not rise to the sky

41:11.159 --> 41:18.676
Tears continuously
eyes are overwhelming

41:18.710 --> 41:23.947
When you have love

41:28.116 --> 41:29.098
I'll go.

41:39.571 --> 41:40.999
Ah, Claire.

41:41.042 --> 41:44.140
I wanted my cello, right?

41:44.177 --> 41:45.453
How brazen.

41:46.929 --> 41:48.423
I want everyone to leave.

41:51.408 --> 41:54.539
I do not know everyone, but
the rats are gone.

41:56.432 --> 41:57.576
How?

41:57.615 --> 41:59.818
The terrified of ghosts.

41:59.855 --> 42:01.261
- Yes?.
"Yes.

42:02.894 --> 42:05.796
And now your sister
is gone too.

42:49.830 --> 42:52.677
Early morning
when the sun rose

42:52.710 --> 42:54.335
I wondered
if you have changed

42:54.374 --> 42:57.570
"If your hair would still be red
"Oh, leave me.

42:59.877 --> 43:03.771
The weatherman says
to be a beautiful day

43:03.812 --> 43:07.292
There will be no clouds in my way

43:07.331 --> 43:10.647
But it's raining

43:10.691 --> 43:14.651
Raining in my heart

43:19.329 --> 43:20.606
Pig.

43:22.177 --> 43:24.032
"I'm sick.
"You're not.

43:24.064 --> 43:25.591
"I'm sick.
It's not true.

43:25.632 --> 43:27.519
I am.

43:27.552 --> 43:28.926
My stomach hurts.

43:31.455 --> 43:32.732
Am I dying.

43:32.767 --> 43:34.971
That will be next,
I die too.

43:36.894 --> 43:38.138
Oh, sorry ...

43:39.326 --> 43:41.878
Forgive me, I can not
I believe that.

43:42.909 --> 43:45.592
I wondered
if you go to work today.

43:49.564 --> 43:51.669
I can not believe I said that.

43:51.708 --> 43:52.853
Do not worry.

43:59.130 --> 44:02.927
You should call so they know
you are dying.

44:02.970 --> 44:04.214
They might worry.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.562
Nina ... Sandy speaks.

44:08.601 --> 44:11.121
Are you hibernating? Where are you?

44:11.161 --> 44:12.949
You think I should go?

44:12.984 --> 44:15.351
- Are not you boiling?
"No, I'm freezing.

44:15.383 --> 44:16.660
Try and repair your heater.

44:16.695 --> 44:20.208
Who installed it?
It's unbelievable, is not working.

44:20.247 --> 44:22.865
What's that guy
that installed ...?

44:22.902 --> 44:25.869
It works perfectly.
We are here as 35 degrees.

44:26.838 --> 44:28.212
So I'll be sick.

44:28.246 --> 44:30.766
I have a disease
as tropical malaria.

44:30.805 --> 44:33.074
I can not go to work
with malaria.

44:33.108 --> 44:35.693
What would you do if
I go to work?

44:35.732 --> 44:38.120
Do not worry,
I have much to do.

44:38.164 --> 44:40.432
"I've been studying Spanish ...
- Spanish?

44:40.468 --> 44:41.809
I knew.

44:41.844 --> 44:43.120
I knew ...

44:44.083 --> 44:46.155
Yes, because when ...

44:46.194 --> 44:50.088
You know, when I could
feel your presence ...

44:50.129 --> 44:51.656
and told me what to do,

44:51.697 --> 44:54.446
as "Close the door
back "and other ...

44:54.481 --> 44:56.520
he said in Spanish.

44:56.561 --> 44:58.862
And that ... that really ...

44:59.825 --> 45:01.253
moved me.

45:03.408 --> 45:05.447
Your accent is not good, but ...

45:22.188 --> 45:24.130
Well, it seems that I'm going to work.

45:27.596 --> 45:28.544
Jamie ...

45:30.507 --> 45:31.455
What did you ...?

45:32.426 --> 45:33.354
What did you ...?

45:33.386 --> 45:34.760
Like it?

45:34.794 --> 45:36.517
Just change a few things.

45:38.121 --> 45:39.550
I cleared a little.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.366
Where is my tiger?

45:44.136 --> 45:46.557
Could return
to where it was.

45:46.601 --> 45:48.804
"No, I just ...
"You know better decorum.

45:48.840 --> 45:51.108
You never learn
to attach a picture.

45:51.144 --> 45:52.518
Let me turn the home.

45:54.950 --> 45:55.899
Y. ..

45:56.870 --> 45:58.910
That you gave me.

46:00.742 --> 46:03.491
I think I must go
to work.

46:03.526 --> 46:05.565
I feel the warmth in the face.

46:05.605 --> 46:08.539
I have to be careful.
I am prone to cold.

46:08.581 --> 46:11.963
lmagínate, if I grab a cold
now I will last an eternity.

46:15.171 --> 46:18.171
No kidding, I'm serious.

46:21.378 --> 46:22.523
Thank you.

46:24.449 --> 46:25.464
Why?

46:26.273 --> 46:27.582
By returning.

46:55.164 --> 46:58.230
- Nina!
"Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:58.268 --> 46:59.283
Maura.

46:59.324 --> 47:01.112
Hello. Ah, no.

47:01.148 --> 47:03.602
Good heavens, "today is ... Thursday?

47:03.643 --> 47:05.650
It's Friday, Nina.
Where have you been?

47:06.715 --> 47:09.682
"Titus? Hello.

47:09.722 --> 47:11.729
"Hello.
- Maura has ...?

47:11.770 --> 47:13.493
Have you been here since yesterday?

47:17.305 --> 47:19.573
"He's doing the cleaning.
- What do you mean?

47:19.609 --> 47:22.227
We need cleaners.
She needs money.

47:22.264 --> 47:25.111
Sandy, she is
to give birth.

47:25.143 --> 47:27.990
Excuse me,
begin again.

47:28.023 --> 47:29.877
You disappear for a week ...

47:29.911 --> 47:32.147
while we work
and return to scold.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.670
Excuse me.
Treats you right away.

47:35.829 --> 47:37.356
Is it really Friday?

47:37.397 --> 47:38.411
Jesus Christ.

47:39.381 --> 47:41.868
To make matters worse,
I called Gabriela.

47:41.908 --> 47:44.941
Screaming hysterically,
as usual.

47:44.980 --> 47:47.630
"Luckily, Maura was here.
- How did that?

47:47.667 --> 47:48.911
Gabriela spoke with Maura,

47:48.948 --> 47:51.598
Maura can talk to you
and thou with me.

47:51.635 --> 47:54.951
And Titus? Do you work here
all our former customers?

47:59.121 --> 48:03.049
Come, come, you owe me
an explanation. lnvéntate something.

48:03.089 --> 48:06.155
And where do you get the gall
to see you so happy?

48:06.192 --> 48:08.679
That really is
a difficult question.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.021
I thought so.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.779
- Do you love me?
-No.

48:12.815 --> 48:14.986
"I mean, as a friend?
-No.

48:15.023 --> 48:18.089
"You do love me as a friend.
"Not me.

48:26.669 --> 48:29.254
You had better call
Rachel Reed.

48:29.292 --> 48:30.634
Did he say why?

48:30.668 --> 48:32.577
No. You'll be late.
He called on Monday.

48:34.860 --> 48:36.201
The 14 days ...

48:41.354 --> 48:43.209
I anticipate
forgive me.

48:45.961 --> 48:47.750
Hello, are you okay?

48:47.785 --> 48:50.632
I'll come tonight
to finish the cabinets.

48:50.665 --> 48:53.664
Well ... no good for me tonight.

48:53.704 --> 48:56.071
Well, I will come tomorrow.

48:56.104 --> 48:58.110
Could we discuss this morning?

48:58.152 --> 49:00.901
"I'll call, Titus.
"Sure.

49:00.935 --> 49:04.644
It is not disinterest
to complete the ...

49:04.679 --> 49:08.027
Is that I guests,
friends in my apartment.

49:08.070 --> 49:11.004
They came unexpectedly y. ..

49:24.195 --> 49:25.755
How's the baby?

49:25.795 --> 49:27.802
Fine, just perfect.

49:29.635 --> 49:34.620
Do not we say "too perfect"
but I like it.

49:34.657 --> 49:37.559
And how should I put it?

49:37.601 --> 49:38.910
"Too perfect" will be fine.

49:46.304 --> 49:50.045
"English, Maura ... if you can.
"It can not.

49:50.079 --> 49:54.453
Sandy and Titus are
sorry for you.

49:54.494 --> 49:56.218
Why just me?.

49:56.254 --> 49:59.602
By the death of his companion.

49:59.645 --> 50:01.979
Does your partner? My companion.

50:02.013 --> 50:05.078
"Yes.
"Well, I'm sad.

50:05.116 --> 50:06.577
Maura ...

50:06.620 --> 50:09.205
Do you think there is life
after death?

50:22.809 --> 50:24.270
Did you make a documentary?

50:26.136 --> 50:28.111
In English, in English.

50:28.152 --> 50:31.730
I make movies,
many films in Chile.

50:33.080 --> 50:36.079
I make films in Chile
I do cleaning and in London.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.588
Spirits
are everywhere.

50:41.622 --> 50:44.469
We are joined here and now
on our walk.

50:45.429 --> 50:46.803
Definitely.

51:08.305 --> 51:11.600
"I used to work here.
- Yes?. It's lovely.

51:17.551 --> 51:20.169
Robert, my friend Nina.
Nina, this is Roberto.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.865
Pleased to meet you.

51:21.903 --> 51:24.750
-Maura told us that help.
"Well ...

51:30.445 --> 51:32.038
A coffee would be great, thanks.

51:33.549 --> 51:36.713
- Roberto is from Chile?
"No, of El Salvador.

51:36.748 --> 51:38.820
It's very good friend.

51:38.861 --> 51:39.809
Maura ...

51:41.036 --> 51:43.687
Does your baby's father is Robert?

51:47.339 --> 51:51.713
I think the Welsh knew
at the Glastonbury Festival.

51:51.754 --> 51:53.280
Not sure.

51:53.321 --> 51:54.848
I have tried to find it.

51:54.889 --> 51:57.409
Ah, no problem.
The baby is mine alone.

52:05.191 --> 52:07.231
What is this?
What do you do?

52:07.271 --> 52:08.732
Roberto is my doctor.

52:08.775 --> 52:10.946
I do not like hospitals.

52:10.983 --> 52:13.852
I'm a doctor ... a physician
in my country.

52:14.822 --> 52:17.822
But continually tell
you should go to hospital.

52:17.862 --> 52:21.277
"I never listen to me.
"It's the same with her.

52:25.541 --> 52:26.784
Shit, your boss.

52:28.004 --> 52:29.826
- Coming!
- What is happening here?.

52:30.627 --> 52:33.529
"Nothing, I'm going away.
"I should have known.

52:33.571 --> 52:34.651
"They paid for the coffees?

52:34.690 --> 52:37.178
"It has brought us.
"Sure.

52:37.218 --> 52:39.192
- Excuse me?
-Continue to deceive.

52:39.234 --> 52:41.405
- How?
"I counted the money ...

52:41.442 --> 52:43.929
accounts and the number
customer and, you know?

52:43.969 --> 52:45.311
Not add up.

52:46.433 --> 52:49.399
I try to help you,
who should not work.

52:49.441 --> 52:52.702
I did not look much and Timan
under my nose.

52:52.735 --> 52:55.255
"Excuse me, speaking very quickly.
"Okay.

52:55.296 --> 52:56.223
Well ...

52:56.255 --> 52:57.913
I will tell you in words
monosyllabic.

52:57.951 --> 53:00.122
You have me
cajoling,

53:00.158 --> 53:01.205
stealing my money,

53:01.246 --> 53:03.002
crucified economically
stealing!

53:10.845 --> 53:12.470
Does anyone here speak English?

53:12.508 --> 53:14.930
He says you
rip-off employees.

53:14.972 --> 53:16.597
Not true!

53:21.530 --> 53:23.669
What is he saying?

53:23.706 --> 53:24.753
Shut up a minute!

53:24.794 --> 53:27.314
You promised to pay
4 pounds per hour,

53:27.354 --> 53:30.484
criminal in itself, but in fact,
only paid 3.

53:30.521 --> 53:33.488
They pay no taxes.
They come here to suck ...

53:33.529 --> 53:36.114
- I pay taxes!
"We ought to consult the law.

53:36.152 --> 53:38.705
They are paying the extra pound
themselves,

53:38.744 --> 53:40.021
of his own money.

53:40.056 --> 53:42.543
These people will
the police headquarters.

53:44.119 --> 53:46.028
I understood that,
calling me a bastard!

53:46.071 --> 53:48.689
Do not think I do not understand!

53:48.726 --> 53:50.962
Look what he's doing!

53:50.998 --> 53:53.965
Nothing in my left sleeve
or the right.

53:54.005 --> 53:56.655
I have nothing on my plate,
just gravy.

53:56.693 --> 53:57.870
Yum.

53:57.908 --> 54:01.737
I take a Russian novel ... should
always be a Russian novel ...

54:01.780 --> 54:03.667
and released into the air.

54:12.498 --> 54:14.669
Any chance
another coffee?

54:21.425 --> 54:22.537
How do you know?

54:24.592 --> 54:26.501
Do I bring?

54:28.048 --> 54:30.535
We're fine, thanks. Right?

54:31.727 --> 54:34.541
Thanks for your intervention.
It was more than extraordinary.

54:35.983 --> 54:37.160
I'm glad I helped.

54:37.197 --> 54:41.801
- Is professional magician?
- Magician? No, no, I'm ...

54:43.597 --> 54:44.545
What?

54:45.900 --> 54:48.682
Nothing but good. Good.

54:49.644 --> 54:50.920
Bye.

54:53.067 --> 54:54.725
A person "too perfect".

55:09.769 --> 55:12.037
I've been calling
and calling.

55:12.072 --> 55:14.177
"Oh, hi, George.
"Your answering machine ...

55:14.216 --> 55:16.354
seems not to work,
so I decided to come.

55:16.392 --> 55:19.042
- Have you been waiting?
"I was worrying about you.

55:20.007 --> 55:21.533
I'm fine.

55:21.574 --> 55:23.396
"Lingers still the situation?

55:23.430 --> 55:25.339
- What situation?
"In your apartment.

55:26.309 --> 55:27.258
George.

55:28.741 --> 55:31.740
You will not believe. They're gone.

55:31.781 --> 55:34.562
Well, only in appearance.
But well, well.

55:34.596 --> 55:36.538
No, surprisingly
are gone forever.

55:36.580 --> 55:41.249
Nina, I have many years
pest control y. ..

55:41.283 --> 55:44.795
as in any war, one
learn to respect the enemy.

55:44.835 --> 55:46.939
Never underestimate the enemy.

55:50.561 --> 55:52.928
Remain silent.

55:52.961 --> 55:54.074
Jamie.

55:54.113 --> 55:57.909
Surprisingly,
remain undetectable.

55:57.952 --> 56:00.734
Do not touch the feeders ...

56:00.767 --> 56:02.622
and I disappear.

56:03.967 --> 56:07.065
And then come back.
They are not stupid.

56:11.134 --> 56:13.500
The feeders are untouched.

56:15.933 --> 56:18.420
The feeders are untouched.

56:19.389 --> 56:22.684
You know, I think
spoken to each other.

56:28.283 --> 56:29.974
"You've cleaned.
"Yes.

56:30.939 --> 56:33.207
I needed that.

56:33.242 --> 56:35.030
He likes to indulge.

56:35.066 --> 56:36.472
- Who?
-A Titus.

56:37.529 --> 56:40.343
I've always
Poles liked.

56:41.305 --> 56:43.760
- You'd take a cup of tea?
"Perfect.

56:46.488 --> 56:49.204
Will it be me, or does
very hot in here?.

56:53.943 --> 56:55.219
Me. I'm leaving.

56:55.255 --> 56:57.905
Okay, George.
Thanks for coming.

56:57.941 --> 56:58.956
Y. ..

56:58.998 --> 57:00.853
forgive me if I was unkind.

57:02.293 --> 57:03.503
You are lovely.

57:04.469 --> 57:06.672
He spoke of you with my wife.

57:08.564 --> 57:09.611
Really?

57:09.652 --> 57:12.073
George, I thought
your wife was dead.

57:12.116 --> 57:13.871
In 1978.

57:13.907 --> 57:17.103
But still I talk and
I explain my daily affairs.

57:18.066 --> 57:20.368
Do not you do the same?

57:20.402 --> 57:22.224
I do, yes.

57:22.258 --> 57:25.224
"And death
not have the ".

57:26.673 --> 57:28.877
We know you and me, right?

57:46.189 --> 57:47.596
God!

57:47.630 --> 57:48.742
Hello.

57:48.781 --> 57:52.610
You scared me terribly.
Do not do that again.

57:52.652 --> 57:55.205
- Is it a bad time?
"Yes, very bad, Jamie.

57:55.244 --> 57:56.585
There are some things ...

57:56.620 --> 57:58.474
Come on, do not be so elusive.

57:58.508 --> 58:00.777
I'm being serious. Go.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.658
Honey, I know
you shave your legs.

58:03.691 --> 58:05.665
I can not
locked the door.

58:05.706 --> 58:08.259
"I thought you would enjoy seeing me.
"Well, no.

58:09.962 --> 58:13.507
Yes I see you,
but leave me alone for a while.

58:13.545 --> 58:16.992
Of course I am happy.
Much afraid that you were gone.

58:21.224 --> 58:22.784
Good-bye.
"Yes.

58:26.567 --> 58:29.501
- Why locked?
I do not know.

58:31.686 --> 58:33.115
Have you switched on the television?

58:34.853 --> 58:35.933
Ah, yes.

58:37.253 --> 58:38.682
Listen, honey ... Do not ...

58:38.724 --> 58:41.058
Some of the group
wanted to return ...

58:42.053 --> 58:44.256
to see some videos.

58:44.292 --> 58:45.273
Who?

58:45.316 --> 58:47.650
Friends, just friends.

58:49.315 --> 58:50.330
"Friends dead?

58:51.778 --> 58:53.339
I dunno, I guess.

58:53.378 --> 58:56.476
You mean dead,
watching videos in my living room?

59:00.193 --> 59:01.599
Well, I know ...

59:01.633 --> 59:03.159
Not available
those videos ...

59:03.201 --> 59:05.437
where they are normally?

59:05.472 --> 59:08.919
Listen, if you create problems ...
These are my friends, Nina.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.261
Okay. I'll tell
to leave.

59:11.295 --> 59:13.564
No, okay.
It's perfectly fine.

59:13.599 --> 59:15.453
Forgotten it could be.

59:15.487 --> 59:17.461
- To be what?
"No matter.

59:17.502 --> 59:18.909
I told you right.

59:23.837 --> 59:24.785
Health.

59:26.716 --> 59:27.731
Health.

59:35.547 --> 59:38.035
I'll tell you his name,
Eric Stewart Campbell.

59:38.075 --> 59:39.962
He is the protagonist
of this film.

59:39.995 --> 59:42.002
This section is a bit silly.

59:42.042 --> 59:44.180
The best scene
is the fight with ...

59:44.218 --> 59:46.322
Eric Stewart Campbell
at the station.

59:46.362 --> 59:48.979
Even Charlie Chaplin
participates. It's brilliant.

59:49.017 --> 59:51.253
Eric died months
after filming.

59:51.288 --> 59:52.782
He said he was overwhelmed.

59:52.824 --> 59:55.377
- And the picture?
-Press the button fly.

01:00:01.207 --> 01:00:02.636
This is Freddie ...

01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:04.751
These are Pierre, Bruno y. ..

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:06.830
-Isaac.
-Isaac, hi.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.593
This is Nina.

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.801
"I'm Bruno.
"Hello.

01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:11.785
Freddie, hi.

01:00:18.644 --> 01:00:21.491
- I can serve anything?
"No thanks.

01:00:21.524 --> 01:00:25.003
The tape says it is
"Manhattan" and it is not.

01:00:25.043 --> 01:00:27.115
You know, the other day ...

01:00:27.154 --> 01:00:29.837
tried to record
"Hannah and Her Sisters" ...

01:00:29.874 --> 01:00:31.084
"Excellent.
-Woody Allen.

01:00:31.122 --> 01:00:34.798
Yes, and I have a hunch ...
I'm useless with that machine.

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:37.069
Did you recorded on it, Nina?

01:00:37.104 --> 01:00:39.079
Kinda made with
"Strangers on a Train."

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.803
- Right?
"I love that movie.

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.366
"He is wonderful.
- Who?

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.992
Robert Walker.
"What a pity, really.

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:48.006
Sorry.

01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:55.844
Laura?

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.387
Yes, John.

01:01:00.428 --> 01:01:02.468
Whatever your dream,

01:01:02.508 --> 01:01:04.777
was not a happy dream, right?

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:11.137
Can I help in any way?

01:01:14.059 --> 01:01:16.425
Yes, Freddie.
You always help me.

01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:18.465
You've been so far
so long.

01:01:22.217 --> 01:01:24.518
Please come back to me.

01:01:36.198 --> 01:01:38.500
FLN

01:01:49.252 --> 01:01:52.219
"" My life is my life "
or "Fitzcarraldo"?

01:01:52.259 --> 01:01:55.968
Friends, sorry,
but I have to sleep.

01:01:56.003 --> 01:01:57.529
Good night.

01:01:57.571 --> 01:01:59.065
I'll be with you soon.

01:02:01.826 --> 01:02:02.774
No evenings.

01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:06.334
Sometámoslo a vote.

01:02:34.044 --> 01:02:35.800
You smell delicious.

01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:41.429
Are you asleep?

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.922
Do you have that bottle
hot water?

01:02:51.962 --> 01:02:55.922
Jamie, I'm so hot
I'm suffocating.

01:02:55.961 --> 01:02:59.572
Forget it, do not worry.
I love you. Go to sleep again.

01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:15.916
My friends are
nice, right?

01:03:18.933 --> 01:03:20.559
Buenísimos types.

01:03:50.479 --> 01:03:51.624
Come on, Maury.

01:03:52.975 --> 01:03:54.885
- Okay?
"Yes, Mark.

01:03:56.078 --> 01:03:57.322
Excuse me.

01:03:57.358 --> 01:03:59.049
"Oh, hi.
"Hello.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.941
- How are you?
"Well.

01:04:00.973 --> 01:04:03.362
This is Anthony.
This is my friend ...

01:04:04.877 --> 01:04:06.764
"Hi, Nina.
"Hello.

01:04:06.797 --> 01:04:09.414
Let's walk,
then paint a bit ...

01:04:09.453 --> 01:04:11.176
and then tea.

01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:12.619
Will you come with us?

01:04:12.652 --> 01:04:15.553
'She must be busy.
-Love,

01:04:15.595 --> 01:04:17.831
but I have an appointment
and I'm late.

01:04:18.795 --> 01:04:22.056
"Well, nice to see you.
"You're nice.

01:04:24.074 --> 01:04:25.153
And your friend?

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:29.121
"The one who will give birth.
-Maura. Okay.

01:04:30.697 --> 01:04:32.158
No, I lost.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.502
Helen! Adrian!

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:38.048
I'd better go.

01:04:39.527 --> 01:04:40.475
Bye.

01:04:49.862 --> 01:04:51.007
Sorry.

01:04:51.045 --> 01:04:52.506
Wait a second.

01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:55.299
I was wondering if any ...
You think we could ...?

01:04:55.332 --> 01:04:58.332
It's probably terrible, but
you can always say no ...

01:04:58.372 --> 01:05:00.641
"Yes, I would.
- Really?

01:05:00.676 --> 01:05:04.418
- Can I phone?
"Yes, no, I'll call you.

01:05:04.451 --> 01:05:06.906
"Well.
"Seriously, I'll call, but ...

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:11.134
"I have no pen, do you?
"Yes, I think.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:14.039
Sorry, does
a pen, please?

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:15.455
Okay, okay.

01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:17.398
"I have no role.
"Write here.

01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:22.491
Well, is 261-08-40.

01:05:22.528 --> 01:05:25.724
And the work is the 267 ...

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.588
"I do not remember.
"No problem.

01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:30.940
"Goodbye.
"Goodbye.

01:05:34.046 --> 01:05:35.671
Goodbye, Ms. Bus.

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:37.138
Farewell, Stephanie.

01:05:42.428 --> 01:05:43.508
I read ...

01:05:46.524 --> 01:05:48.695
I read, probably
in books ...

01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:51.120
I gave
about grief,

01:05:51.163 --> 01:05:52.111
y. ..

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.122
was about the possibility ...

01:05:55.162 --> 01:05:56.788
for some people ...

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.958
of becoming intensely ...

01:06:00.986 --> 01:06:03.090
which the beloved has returned.

01:06:04.313 --> 01:06:07.062
I do not mean to feel
its presence in the abstract,

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.779
but who have returned
indeed ...

01:06:11.704 --> 01:06:13.297
and are in the house.

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:19.470
What do you think of that?
Do you consider ridiculous?

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:20.884
What?

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.535
What is ridiculous?

01:06:25.494 --> 01:06:27.315
Well, I dunno.

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:30.163
When I read it,
I considered ridiculous.

01:06:30.197 --> 01:06:31.211
Why?

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.958
I can imagine.

01:06:34.996 --> 01:06:38.094
I can imagine returning
home tonight ...

01:06:38.132 --> 01:06:39.538
and meeting Jamie.

01:06:40.883 --> 01:06:43.271
"He has returned.
"Well.

01:06:43.314 --> 01:06:44.459
But then ...

01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:47.598
But then what?

01:06:47.633 --> 01:06:50.088
So what
find ridiculous?

01:06:52.657 --> 01:06:53.704
Well ...

01:06:55.088 --> 01:06:57.227
Ah, I know, I know.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:58.824
Everything, everything, everything, everything.

01:06:58.863 --> 01:06:59.943
I do not know.

01:08:03.653 --> 01:08:06.336
Sorry, sorry
sorry, sorry.

01:08:06.372 --> 01:08:07.681
So sorry.

01:08:12.515 --> 01:08:15.002
"Sorry.
"Oh, are precious.

01:08:16.227 --> 01:08:17.536
Thank you.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:20.603
What a delightful smell.
It's ridiculous, but has already started.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.910
No matter.
We can do something else.

01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:24.984
I can not.
- Why?

01:08:25.024 --> 01:08:26.683
Is something wrong?

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.568
I must go elsewhere.
It's very complicated.

01:08:31.264 --> 01:08:33.051
It's complicated, but no ...

01:08:33.087 --> 01:08:36.349
I guarantee that what
think is not right.

01:08:38.366 --> 01:08:41.300
What will I tell my group?

01:08:41.343 --> 01:08:42.749
They are well anxious.

01:08:42.782 --> 01:08:44.243
Is that ...?

01:08:44.285 --> 01:08:47.318
- Are they your work o. ..?
"Yes, we drew trees.

01:08:47.358 --> 01:08:50.652
Draw a tree
and roots and branches ...

01:08:50.685 --> 01:08:51.796
put the names ...

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:52.948
Do you have time for this?

01:08:52.988 --> 01:08:54.548
"Yes, yes, sure.
"Well.

01:08:55.868 --> 01:08:57.493
You draw a tree and then ...

01:08:57.531 --> 01:09:00.826
writing about the roots
the names of people who ...

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:04.371
you formed, stabilized,
who took care of you ...

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:05.937
parents, siblings, former ...

01:09:05.978 --> 01:09:09.490
then write the names of
people around you now,

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:12.017
on the branches, and leaves.

01:09:12.057 --> 01:09:15.024
"Excuse me, do you follow?
"Yes, I think so.

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:18.412
Is ambitious, but I did.
I was doing my tree.

01:09:18.456 --> 01:09:21.423
Anthony, whom you met,
said, "Where is Nina?"

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:25.227
In fact ...

01:09:26.613 --> 01:09:29.712
not only the group
is anxious, but ...

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.876
- Need a ride somewhere?
"No, I'll be fine.

01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:37.393
Are not we both northbound?

01:09:37.428 --> 01:09:40.013
I leave you at last
of the road. It would ...

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.866
No, I will take the bus.
It's better this way.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:45.004
Please join me on the subway.

01:09:45.044 --> 01:09:45.992
If you want.

01:09:51.602 --> 01:09:54.766
The shorter appointment
of my life, and yours?

01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.589
"Also.
"We have something in common.

01:09:58.193 --> 01:09:59.948
Want to know my name?

01:09:59.985 --> 01:10:01.927
- Wait, wait, stop!
- What?

01:10:01.969 --> 01:10:04.237
Well, well, that is
what.

01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:08.101
I tell you all my life
between here and that statue.

01:10:08.143 --> 01:10:11.012
See? And you tell me
yours, right?

01:10:11.055 --> 01:10:13.259
We do jumping,
of course.

01:10:13.294 --> 01:10:16.392
Without lying, without interrupting,
no questions asked.

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:17.706
And we left.

01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:20.490
Mark Damian DeGrunwald,
nearly 32 years of age,

01:10:20.525 --> 01:10:23.045
born Budleigh Salterton,
under the sign of Capricorn.

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.710
I do not believe in zodiac signs.

01:10:24.749 --> 01:10:27.596
Parents alive, retired.
Father, silent.

01:10:27.628 --> 01:10:28.838
Practically,
completely silent,

01:10:28.876 --> 01:10:30.763
18 years older than my mother,

01:10:30.796 --> 01:10:32.289
who is not silent.

01:10:32.332 --> 01:10:35.146
Owners in series
several small businesses.

01:10:35.179 --> 01:10:36.836
Amateur magician, my father ...

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:40.704
and I was his assistant at dinner
Conservative club.

01:10:40.746 --> 01:10:43.593
Regularly sawed in two
from 7 years ...

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:45.764
and disappeared in circumstances
ideologically unfavorable.

01:10:45.801 --> 01:10:47.110
Change legs.

01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:50.657
What else? The house parents,
puberty, all acceptable.

01:10:50.696 --> 01:10:53.991
An older brother, happy
academic career without problems.

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.920
Slightly asthmatic, I tried
suicide at age 17,

01:10:57.959 --> 01:10:59.747
not remember how sad.

01:10:59.782 --> 01:11:01.026
Cleaning the stomach,

01:11:01.063 --> 01:11:03.429
followed by sessions
with educational psychologist ...

01:11:03.462 --> 01:11:05.828
by those who develop
intense passion ...

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:08.512
encouraged me to become
a psychologist myself.

01:11:08.549 --> 01:11:11.331
Degree in psychology,
University of Sussex,

01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:13.153
training in art
therapy ...

01:11:13.188 --> 01:11:16.123
What is art as therapy?
Draw trees.

01:11:16.164 --> 01:11:19.459
I have a daughter, Gemma, 7 years.
I had to say before.

01:11:19.491 --> 01:11:21.378
His mother left me ...

01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:24.509
by a theology student ...
I do not believe in God ...

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.433
enough time with me
to get pregnant.

01:11:26.466 --> 01:11:28.091
Gemma is 7 years old. Did I?

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:32.951
His hair is curly and erupt
freckles bright sun ...

01:11:32.993 --> 01:11:35.676
I called Mark DeGrunwald
and the pastor, Father.

01:11:35.713 --> 01:11:37.817
I enjoy basically everything
music, curry.

01:11:37.856 --> 01:11:40.027
I recite the works
complete ...

01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:43.677
I live alone, my fridge is empty.

01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:46.558
I am interested Nina
who is not on my tree.

01:11:46.591 --> 01:11:49.046
- Your turn! Do not think, say it!
I can not.

01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:50.908
Yes

01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:53.014
Nina Mitchell. I ...
"Say jumping.

01:11:53.054 --> 01:11:55.988
God! Nina Mitchell.
I can not believe this.

01:11:56.029 --> 01:11:59.127
Capricorn, but do not think,
So, forget it.

01:11:59.165 --> 01:12:01.619
I think it can be a God,
'm interpreter ...

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.903
I started at the end.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.241
I believe in protest
and the possibility ...

01:12:05.276 --> 01:12:06.737
to improve the planet.

01:12:06.779 --> 01:12:09.779
I hate how this country
is himself

01:12:09.819 --> 01:12:13.430
how it treats people
of other races and visitors.

01:12:13.466 --> 01:12:15.190
It happens every day. Oh, help!

01:12:16.794 --> 01:12:18.648
I once witnessed in the coffee.

01:12:18.681 --> 01:12:21.430
If you have skin, size, or form
different, you're lost.

01:12:21.464 --> 01:12:23.853
Or religion, ideology,
or different class.

01:12:23.896 --> 01:12:27.376
That's me ... ah, you want
that focus more on the personal?

01:12:27.415 --> 01:12:30.000
Granted, my parents
living in Gloucestershire.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.047
Teachers: he, geography,
her story.

01:12:32.087 --> 01:12:33.613
Holidays wondering,
"Dad, where are we?

01:12:33.655 --> 01:12:34.931
"Mom, what were here before?"

01:12:34.966 --> 01:12:36.788
Enjoy them.
I have a sister, Claire.

01:12:36.822 --> 01:12:39.440
I love you,
but I hate her husband.

01:12:39.478 --> 01:12:42.412
He is a social climber,
climber in business ...

01:12:42.453 --> 01:12:45.682
and now, finally,
has begun to climb mountains.

01:12:45.716 --> 01:12:48.749
They have a son, Harry,
and now await the second.

01:12:48.788 --> 01:12:51.275
I love to their son,
my nephew.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:54.065
Did I mention I was born in Stratford?

01:12:54.099 --> 01:12:56.302
Payment for speaking
once a week.

01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:59.884
That's what I was when I saw you.
To Dr. Burge.

01:12:59.922 --> 01:13:02.639
The difference is that
Army beyond me ...

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:04.561
and you seems to flow
effortlessly.

01:13:04.594 --> 01:13:06.732
I play piano and I love Bach.

01:13:06.768 --> 01:13:09.288
I have rats and a big mess.
I live alone.

01:13:09.329 --> 01:13:11.084
I have not always lived alone ...

01:13:18.383 --> 01:13:20.325
Vamos, Nina, you are jumping.

01:14:25.316 --> 01:14:27.323
I love you, do not stop playing.

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:28.541
Where have you been?

01:14:28.579 --> 01:14:31.426
Nowhere, nowhere.
At work.

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:32.865
It's so late.

01:14:32.899 --> 01:14:34.687
I know, sorry.

01:14:34.722 --> 01:14:35.801
I was worried.

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:37.817
Forgive me.

01:14:38.785 --> 01:14:40.574
As in the happy years.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.655
Is there something you want me?

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.571
I feel you're with me
all day, is it true?

01:14:54.015 --> 01:14:56.917
Sometimes I think you
continuously watching ...

01:14:56.958 --> 01:15:00.405
and if so, you know
I like someone loading ...

01:15:00.445 --> 01:15:03.227
loved ones
shoulders.

01:15:03.261 --> 01:15:05.399
If that is what I asked.

01:15:06.365 --> 01:15:08.535
It was not the case, but thanks.

01:15:16.027 --> 01:15:19.190
Where is the TV
and machine videos?

01:15:19.226 --> 01:15:21.397
I put in
the bedroom because ...

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:25.557
were uncomfortable here
with cold and I wanted to play.

01:15:25.593 --> 01:15:28.014
Do not worry, will
when we go to bed.

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:29.333
No problem.

01:15:29.369 --> 01:15:31.507
"Do not get embarrassed.
"Please.

01:15:31.545 --> 01:15:33.716
You can not return
late at night ...

01:15:33.752 --> 01:15:35.726
and complain because
I have guests.

01:15:35.768 --> 01:15:37.294
It's not late.

01:15:37.335 --> 01:15:39.855
I know these people.

01:15:39.895 --> 01:15:43.123
Neither know what historical era
belong! This is ridiculous.

01:15:43.159 --> 01:15:45.460
You could try
talk to them.

01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:48.592
I can not believe it.

01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:51.662
I ghost watching videos
in my bedroom

01:15:51.701 --> 01:15:53.392
What you accuse me of what?

01:15:53.428 --> 01:15:54.770
What you accuse me?

01:15:55.732 --> 01:15:57.161
Jamie, are dead!

01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:59.506
The rats were.
Now I have ghosts!

01:15:59.539 --> 01:16:02.887
There are only 8 or 9 people.
Do not hurt.

01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:06.159
If you want to sleep,
tell him and leave.

01:16:07.186 --> 01:16:09.422
If you want me to go, tell me.

01:16:09.458 --> 01:16:13.069
Why are only men?
Do not want you to go.

01:16:13.105 --> 01:16:14.927
I do not know what I want.

01:16:21.263 --> 01:16:22.212
Well ...

01:16:23.183 --> 01:16:25.419
I bought a bottle
hot water.

01:16:26.383 --> 01:16:27.331
You want it?

01:16:31.406 --> 01:16:33.097
Thank you.

01:16:33.133 --> 01:16:34.889
Yum.

01:16:38.605 --> 01:16:42.881
Why not return to glory
when I go to work?

01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:48.073
I do not know, is like choosing
and then you ...

01:16:48.107 --> 01:16:49.895
I do not know.

01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:52.516
I'm here.
Okay, I feel good.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:54.792
I love you.

01:16:58.186 --> 01:17:00.073
Gently.

01:17:01.065 --> 01:17:04.229
Hi Nina, I heard your voice.
"You remembered to go to ...?

01:17:04.264 --> 01:17:05.824
Yes

01:17:05.865 --> 01:17:08.581
They had "l Vitelloni"
but I brought ...

01:17:11.624 --> 01:17:13.511
Pinocchio and "Forget Venice.

01:17:13.543 --> 01:17:16.128
Formidable. Have you seen,
Jamie, "Forget Venice"?

01:17:16.167 --> 01:17:18.588
Tremendous and so tender.

01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:20.452
Isaac says you're in check.

01:17:20.486 --> 01:17:23.333
Your turn.
Luce bad your situation.

01:17:24.293 --> 01:17:26.148
It can not be ...

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.147
How will I be in check?
One minute, love.

01:17:58.559 --> 01:17:59.606
Sorry.

01:18:02.302 --> 01:18:04.157
Thanks, Freddie. Hello?

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.258
Yes

01:18:09.949 --> 01:18:11.258
Oh, God!

01:18:11.293 --> 01:18:13.561
Well, yes, of course.

01:18:13.597 --> 01:18:14.938
Yes, I go.

01:18:29.818 --> 01:18:32.501
Hello, I'm friends with Maura.
How is she?

01:18:32.538 --> 01:18:35.319
Okay, list
to the delivery room.

01:18:36.856 --> 01:18:39.060
- Can I accompany you?
I do not see why not.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:43.565
- Is ... is all ... all ... ?
"Do not worry.

01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:45.495
Ah, listen, sorry.

01:18:45.528 --> 01:18:48.210
Have you talked about
drugs? Because ...

01:18:48.247 --> 01:18:50.134
Have you given any drugs?

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:51.443
It has not taken anything yet.

01:18:51.478 --> 01:18:54.380
You can get gas and air
or Pethedine, or whatever.

01:18:54.422 --> 01:18:57.967
No, no, let me ask.
Do not think that's going a. ..

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.089
Yes, yes, drugs.
Give me drugs, yes.

01:19:07.123 --> 01:19:09.840
He believes that the wishes
for now, but ...

01:19:10.898 --> 01:19:12.360
What's wrong?

01:19:23.569 --> 01:19:26.635
He mentions it frequently.
"Titus is the father of the baby?

01:19:30.576 --> 01:19:32.037
Will you want?

01:19:32.079 --> 01:19:34.250
Really? Good.

01:19:34.287 --> 01:19:36.392
"We can go now.
"Okay.

01:19:40.462 --> 01:19:42.633
Breathe deeply y. ..

01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:44.808
Push! Well, fine.

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.827
Push!

01:19:46.829 --> 01:19:48.584
Well. Excellent, push!

01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:50.213
Right now.

01:19:51.148 --> 01:19:54.344
Well, there's the head.
The head is there.

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.135
Push again
He's ready to leave.

01:19:56.171 --> 01:19:58.276
You should now gasping. Do you understand?

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:02.947
Pant, pant, pant.
Again.

01:20:05.865 --> 01:20:07.458
Well. I head out.

01:20:07.497 --> 01:20:10.279
He left his head. Okay.

01:20:51.234 --> 01:20:52.608
Hello, beautiful.

01:21:01.792 --> 01:21:02.937
A new life.

01:21:06.143 --> 01:21:07.834
A new life.

01:21:24.892 --> 01:21:28.208
- What's here?.
Nina, hello. Wait.

01:21:28.252 --> 01:21:31.066
And tell me, was male or female?

01:21:31.099 --> 01:21:34.546
"A girl.
- It was a girl, Pierre!

01:21:34.586 --> 01:21:36.473
-Pierre.
- What?

01:21:36.506 --> 01:21:38.677
-Maura gave birth to a girl.
- Tremendous!

01:21:38.713 --> 01:21:40.753
It is so touching birth.

01:21:40.793 --> 01:21:42.702
Freddie, what do
with the furniture?

01:21:42.745 --> 01:21:43.989
Ah, will be phenomenal.

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:46.446
Jamie reviewed the soil
and loved ...

01:21:46.489 --> 01:21:48.179
magnificent plates
Victorian.

01:21:48.216 --> 01:21:50.517
They are pulling the rug
as we speak.

01:21:58.263 --> 01:21:59.921
Good work.

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.609
You just need a good polishing.
It is oak.

01:22:02.646 --> 01:22:04.882
"It's hard wood.
- Oak or Ash?

01:22:04.918 --> 01:22:06.772
Jamie, what are you doing?

01:22:06.805 --> 01:22:08.266
What incredible plates
hidden ...

01:22:08.309 --> 01:22:10.251
for that carpet so disgusting.

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:13.358
You should burn because
have mold and silverfish.

01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:15.916
But these plates.
So was a girl?

01:22:15.955 --> 01:22:17.297
I like that rug.

01:22:17.331 --> 01:22:19.022
Do not be absurd.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:22.125
Well, I like
and have no right to treat ...

01:22:22.162 --> 01:22:23.656
my apartment as if ...

01:22:23.698 --> 01:22:26.032
Nina, the carpet was
worn to the fullest.

01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:28.170
Is worn,
moldy and full of mushrooms.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:30.762
You must admit that the plates
are very beautiful ...

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.524
I feel I am
being raided ...

01:22:32.561 --> 01:22:35.048
Each time I arrive at my house!

01:22:36.272 --> 01:22:38.606
Dear God ... The apartment ...

01:22:38.639 --> 01:22:42.086
You take away my pictures
where I put them ...

01:22:42.127 --> 01:22:44.941
This is my apartment, Jamie!
It's my apartment!

01:22:49.518 --> 01:22:51.372
Want to discuss
this in public?

01:22:51.406 --> 01:22:54.918
It's a little embarrassing
for all and for me ...

01:22:54.957 --> 01:22:56.996
No, I do not want.

01:22:57.036 --> 01:22:59.338
I do not want an audience
in my own apartment.

01:22:59.372 --> 01:23:02.154
It is absolutely true.
Can you leave your friends?

01:23:03.307 --> 01:23:06.373
Could he go around the world,
do you think?

01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:09.891
Could I be
alone in my ...? Now!

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:11.752
Now.

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:12.996
Please.

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.510
Is it much to ask?

01:23:23.816 --> 01:23:24.764
Sorry.

01:23:32.294 --> 01:23:33.571
Satisfied?

01:23:48.868 --> 01:23:50.428
It's just dust.

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:55.547
Nina, that was
truly humbling.

01:23:57.154 --> 01:24:00.415
They are asked to help
voluntarily,

01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:02.621
I loaded the furniture
for hours ...

01:24:02.657 --> 01:24:04.828
and you return
and burst a tantrum.

01:24:05.793 --> 01:24:07.702
That was ... really ...

01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:12.215
very, very humiliating.

01:24:20.702 --> 01:24:21.946
Was that before?

01:24:23.198 --> 01:24:25.238
- What?
-Prior.

01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:27.186
Was it so we got?

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.178
Like what?

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:33.943
Listen.

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:36.598
Your friend has just given birth.
You're stale.

01:24:36.636 --> 01:24:39.450
It's traumatic.
It is an emotional experience.

01:24:39.483 --> 01:24:41.108
Do not turn it into ...

01:24:42.075 --> 01:24:44.246
Tell me about our
first night together.

01:24:47.674 --> 01:24:48.622
Why?

01:24:49.369 --> 01:24:51.125
Will you, really?

01:24:52.409 --> 01:24:53.750
What did we do?

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:56.598
We talked.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.508
What else?

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.949
The conversation was
the major component.

01:25:06.614 --> 01:25:08.043
You touched that piano.

01:25:09.558 --> 01:25:10.703
And I played y. ..

01:25:11.765 --> 01:25:13.772
both touch ...

01:25:13.814 --> 01:25:17.075
I do not remember a duo.

01:25:18.164 --> 01:25:21.938
You danced for 3 hours
until I fell asleep,

01:25:21.972 --> 01:25:24.273
but you were fantastic.

01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:29.226
And then we ate cereal.

01:25:32.274 --> 01:25:35.023
And when we kiss ...

01:25:35.057 --> 01:25:38.602
at about 11:00
the next morning ...

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:43.365
trembling so
we could not undress.

01:25:49.903 --> 01:25:51.212
You know, I ...

01:25:54.446 --> 01:25:57.228
I held that baby ... so ...

01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:04.874
It's life.
It's a life I want.

01:26:05.836 --> 01:26:07.658
My likes, my stuff ...

01:26:07.692 --> 01:26:09.895
After dying, unearth
things in my trunk ...

01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:13.095
he had kept because
tu te mofabas of them ...

01:26:13.131 --> 01:26:15.497
books, photos and stuff.

01:26:15.531 --> 01:26:17.189
I did not know ...

01:26:17.226 --> 01:26:19.909
change a fuse
or find a plumber ...

01:26:19.945 --> 01:26:21.472
or adjust the heating.

01:26:21.513 --> 01:26:22.920
But now they are.

01:26:22.953 --> 01:26:25.026
And this is
an apartment ridiculous

01:26:25.065 --> 01:26:28.741
but I will get gradually and will
beautiful, it could be, I think.

01:26:28.777 --> 01:26:29.856
And I ...

01:26:29.897 --> 01:26:32.744
I longed so much.

01:26:35.431 --> 01:26:37.057
I craved.

01:26:46.117 --> 01:26:47.677
How good is your Spanish?

01:26:50.724 --> 01:26:52.350
What?

01:26:52.388 --> 01:26:55.038
I would like
I translate a poem.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.616
I read it and there's a piece ...

01:26:59.652 --> 01:27:02.269
I'd like to hear ...

01:27:18.912 --> 01:27:20.286
I know that poem.

01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:49.433
All the leaves fall
in my chest.

01:28:16.054 --> 01:28:17.647
Your accent is horrible.

01:28:39.475 --> 01:28:43.086
My feet want to go
to where you sleep ...

01:28:44.561 --> 01:28:46.568
but I shall live.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.615
- You want me to go?
"No, never, never, never.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.208
So?

01:30:07.267 --> 01:30:08.958
I think so.

01:30:11.234 --> 01:30:12.249
Yes

01:30:54.779 --> 01:30:56.305
The explorers arriving by train.

01:30:56.347 --> 01:30:58.070
All aboard the train.

01:31:12.728 --> 01:31:14.037
Where is the lion?

01:31:18.071 --> 01:31:19.249
Is it dangerous?

01:31:20.438 --> 01:31:22.064
Is it dangerous?

01:32:06.511 --> 01:32:08.299
We can always watch a film.

01:32:09.326 --> 01:32:11.333
Or, will you try
drama again?

01:32:14.254 --> 01:32:15.814
Or just ...

01:32:15.853 --> 01:32:18.220
we go to dinner.

01:32:18.253 --> 01:32:20.457
"As you like.
"Okay.

01:32:37.993 --> 01:32:39.455
Sorry, I a. ..

01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:44.070
mourn ... and will do ...
any way y. ..

01:32:45.641 --> 01:32:47.495
I feel so ... I'm sorry.

01:33:00.934 --> 01:33:02.046
I have ...

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:06.179
I suspect that living with someone.

01:33:06.212 --> 01:33:09.114
I'm a private detective
but do not give me ...

01:33:09.156 --> 01:33:11.970
or your address,
or your phone, so ...

01:33:12.004 --> 01:33:14.425
No, really
I do not live with anyone.

01:33:14.467 --> 01:33:16.190
Because I think ...

01:33:17.347 --> 01:33:19.005
if you are not free ...

01:33:21.122 --> 01:33:23.227
then, honestly ...

01:33:24.705 --> 01:33:25.883
I will be ...

01:33:27.457 --> 01:33:29.312
which play
embarrassing role.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.974
I think I'm free.

01:33:40.703 --> 01:33:43.092
You see, I wanted
someone so much.

01:33:44.638 --> 01:33:45.947
Plenty.

01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:48.439
But he died.

01:33:50.365 --> 01:33:51.608
He died.

01:33:52.796 --> 01:33:56.178
And I was very difficult
cope.

01:34:02.107 --> 01:34:05.903
Why do not we
home and talk?

01:34:05.947 --> 01:34:08.434
You can tell me
whatever you want.

01:34:08.474 --> 01:34:10.329
Anything, everything.

01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.079
Whatever you want.

01:34:37.077 --> 01:34:39.346
Would you stop, you could
stop, please?

01:34:44.628 --> 01:34:46.034
Are you okay?

01:35:09.935 --> 01:35:11.626
What was this stop?

01:35:13.871 --> 01:35:15.147
It is not a threat.

01:37:46.549 --> 01:37:48.239
Hello, I am.

01:37:48.277 --> 01:37:50.513
"Oh, hi.
- Can you come to pick?

01:37:52.308 --> 01:37:54.130
No, I'm sorry.

01:37:56.467 --> 01:37:59.402
Because I know where you live.

01:37:59.443 --> 01:38:00.904
It's a small problem.

01:38:04.882 --> 01:38:10.063
"It's the 6-A of Evingham Road.
- Where is that?

01:38:10.097 --> 01:38:12.300
-M6, yes.
"I'll find.

01:38:13.297 --> 01:38:15.914
- Am I now or what?
"Yes.

01:38:15.952 --> 01:38:17.032
I'm on the road.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.593
Remember your toothbrush.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:22.593
Okay.
