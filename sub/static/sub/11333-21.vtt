00:01.543 --> 00:02.836
Previously on:

00:02.836 --> 00:04.129
Finn Court, please.

00:04.129 --> 00:05.506
Not here.
Excuse me?

00:05.506 --> 00:07.382
Checked out about an hour ago.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.259
You know, you really should be
a little nicer to me

00:09.259 --> 00:12.137
now that I'll be handling
your finances.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.097
I know you can take
this tennis all the way.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.767
No more distractions,
no more girlfriends.

00:16.767 --> 00:17.977
Break up with her,
Teddy.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.353
I believe in you,
and to see you

00:19.353 --> 00:21.396
like this, all depressed
and down on yourself,

00:21.396 --> 00:23.524
it hurts-- the worst feeling
in the world.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.610
Seeing you happy--
that means everything to me.

00:26.610 --> 00:30.656
A beautiful girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend?

00:30.656 --> 00:31.699
(chuckles)

00:31.699 --> 00:33.325
Uh, no, I don't.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.453
There's no one, no special guy,

00:36.453 --> 00:38.288
no one.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.878
So, what movie are we going
to see, guys?
I don't care,

00:43.878 --> 00:46.505
as long as it's not some stupid
pop culture piece of crap.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.007
You know, I mean,
just because something's popular

00:48.007 --> 00:49.048
doesn't mean it's any good.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.175
No, in fact, sometimes,

00:50.175 --> 00:52.011
sometimes
it's the exact opposite.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.137
Lots of people like cigarettes,
but they cause cancer.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.347
You have any idea
what he's talking about?
No.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.057
Yeah, stupid pop
culture cancer--

00:57.057 --> 00:58.183
that's what I'm talking about.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.518
Dude, what is
your problem?

00:59.518 --> 01:01.061
You want to know
what my problem is, man?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.270
You want to know
what my problem is?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.772
I'll show you my problem.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.857
That.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.817
This right here is my problem.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.109
Javier, huh?

01:08.109 --> 01:09.987
Hey, can you get
out of here, please?!

01:09.987 --> 01:11.030
I'm tired of looking

01:11.030 --> 01:13.156
at his face!

01:13.156 --> 01:14.783
Aren't you guys
broken up?

01:14.783 --> 01:15.868
Yeah, wow,

01:15.868 --> 01:17.745
I know that already, okay?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.873
(sighs)

01:20.873 --> 01:22.374
But maybe I don't want to be.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.420
Well, have you told Ade that
you ended it with Lila yet?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.087
No, I didn't tell her yet.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.965
Dude, that's the first step:
you're supposed to tell her.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.634
Yeah, and step two:
let her know you want her back.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.053
And step three: cut a single,

01:34.053 --> 01:35.930
become
an overnight teen heartthrob.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.306
NAOMI:
Does he kiss like
a teen heartthrob or not?

01:38.306 --> 01:40.684
I don't know. We've been
on, like, two dates.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.978
If you guys come to my gig
on Friday, you can meet him.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.522
He'll be there.
Aah, Ade, it's your first gig!

01:45.522 --> 01:46.523
I'm so excited!

01:46.523 --> 01:47.649
Um, Miss,

01:47.649 --> 01:48.943
do you have another card?

01:48.943 --> 01:51.612
This one's
been declined.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.365
Why were my cards
declined?

01:55.365 --> 01:56.742
Fix this, please.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.703
Oh, let me take
a look and see.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.496
(sighs)

02:02.790 --> 02:06.835
They don't work
because I canceled them.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.798
You've been spending entirely
too much money and, well,

02:10.798 --> 02:13.467
you're on a financial diet
now, consisting

02:13.467 --> 02:15.052
of low-denomination greens--

02:15.052 --> 02:17.220
that's fives and tens,
little sister.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.932
Oh, thank you.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.391
Oh, would you excuse me?

02:21.391 --> 02:24.061
I have to sign a check
for my shrimp vendor.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.940
I'll ask if he's hiring.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.114
(phone ringing)

02:35.114 --> 02:36.406
Hello.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.533
Hi. This is Jay Boyd.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.535
I don't know a Jay Boyd.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.787
JEN:
What are you doing?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.038
That's my phone.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.623
(sighs)

02:44.623 --> 02:46.207
Hello.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.335
Hi, yes, this, this
really isn't a good time.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.754
Can I call you back?

02:50.754 --> 02:52.714
Okay.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.802
What was that all about?
None of your business.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.386
Look, now that I'm in charge,
things are going

02:58.386 --> 03:01.348
to change--
a lot of things.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.267
Frugal is the new black.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.939
Do you really have
to go to Australia

03:08.939 --> 03:10.107
all summer?
Oh...

03:10.107 --> 03:13.234
I mean, I'm gonna
really miss you.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.698
You should come.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.366
To Australia?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.493
I mean, if you wanted to.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.662
No, no, I-I want to.

03:23.662 --> 03:24.955
Really?

03:24.955 --> 03:27.666
Yeah, I really want to.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.835
(both laugh)

03:29.835 --> 03:32.546
Cool.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.091
(both laugh)

03:38.052 --> 03:39.970
So I've got an idea.
Okay.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.304
What if we start
our presentation

03:41.304 --> 03:43.557
by playing Vivaldi
for, like, ten minutes?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.976
Which means we'd only have
to talk about Vivaldi

03:45.976 --> 03:47.186
for, like, five.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.478
Yeah, I think
Matthews had something

03:48.478 --> 03:50.438
a little more
interactive in mind.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.399
But we could do an
interpretive dance

03:52.399 --> 03:53.942
while the music plays...
Yeah.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.318
Hmm, yeah, and
I'm serious.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.778
Bring the ballet slippers
next meeting.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.864
Okay.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.856
So... when did you get
out of the hospital?

04:32.856 --> 04:34.482
Couple days ago.

04:34.482 --> 04:38.028
My doctors think I'm ready
to reintegrate into West Bev,

04:38.028 --> 04:39.320
so here I am.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.031
Reintegrating.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.033
Well, that's great.

04:43.033 --> 04:47.328
And, um, are you...
Better?

04:47.328 --> 04:49.957
Yeah. I feel better.

04:49.957 --> 04:54.211
Or at least I will, once I say
to you what I need to say...

04:54.211 --> 04:55.587
Look.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.215
Annie, there's no excuses
for what I did.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.925
But I need to explain.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.468
You don't have to.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.053
I do.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.015
I was always an outcast.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.184
And then you came along.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.813
And I saw how much
my uncle's death affected you,

05:12.813 --> 05:14.648
and I took advantage of that.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.653
I didn't think I was gonna
fall in love with you.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.281
But I did.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.284
And then, when you threatened
to leave me,

05:25.284 --> 05:26.701
I panicked.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.498
Whatever.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.292
I'm not here to make excuses.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.876
I'm here to apologize.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.671
You're one of the
good ones, Annie.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.799
If there's any way
that you can forgive me,

05:40.799 --> 05:42.217
maybe we can be friends.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.011
Jasper, stop.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.429
I can forgive you.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.723
And I do.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.683
You do?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.185
Mm-hmm.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.770
But we can't be friends.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.690
There's just too much
that's happened.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.818
I understand.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.820
Thanks for listening to me.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.122
Okay, so what's the difference
between a big tennis practice

06:12.122 --> 06:13.707
and a regular
tennis practice?

06:13.707 --> 06:14.958
Well, a big tennis practice

06:14.958 --> 06:16.417
comes before a big
tennis tournament.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.461
(sighs)
Which I'm gonna win,
by the way,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
earning myself #1 rankings
in nationals.

06:20.922 --> 06:21.798
Hold your applause.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.342
I can't. Look.
I can't.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.593
So, then, you
better go.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.595
Yeah, I should definitely go.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.513
Yeah.
Yeah.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.057
Yeah.
Yeah.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.226
(chuckles)

06:32.226 --> 06:34.728
Okay. Okay.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.271
Go.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.523
(laughs)

06:39.274 --> 06:40.817
(groans)
What?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.778
Has Teddy dipped his pen
in the ol' inkwell recently?

06:43.778 --> 06:44.905
Dipped his pen...?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.740
Have you done
the mattress mambo?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.908
No, okay?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.951
No, we have not had sex.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.080
But I want to.
I really want to.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.664
It's just... Okay.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.291
The only time
I've ever done it,

06:56.291 --> 06:58.335
I was going through
a manic phase.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.419
So, now...
I don't know...

07:00.419 --> 07:02.463
I feel like I'm a virgin
again, or something.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.757
You know?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.550
I just want it to
be right this time.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.554
But how do you know
when it's the right time?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.514
I think you'll just know.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.291
What are you doing here?

07:37.291 --> 07:39.251
Every now and then I like
to stop at high schools

07:39.251 --> 07:40.919
and get a little ego boost.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.503
(laughs)

07:42.503 --> 07:43.880
I just wanted to see you.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.006
(chuckling)

07:48.176 --> 07:50.678
Come. I have a special night
planned for us.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.055
Um...

07:52.055 --> 07:54.515
I am really not dressed.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.268
I had my assistant
pick up a dress

07:56.268 --> 07:58.686
and shoes.
I hope that's okay.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.817
Oh... Are you serious?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.068
Is that a yes?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.403
Yes, that's a yes.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.196
(laughs)
Let's go.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.614
This is amazing.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.718
(phone beeps)

08:36.350 --> 08:39.477
All right.
Thanks, man.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.729
You're still pushing
your forehand a little.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.858
(chuckles) Everyone's an expert
from the sidelines.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.526
Well, but I know.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.611
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.239
You got a text
from, uh, Silver.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.658
Hmm.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.243
Still having
a little trouble

08:55.243 --> 08:57.578
accepting it's over?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.080
Actually, uh, it's not.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.540
Over.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.209
I thought we decided
you were breaking up with her.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.169
Hmm. No, you-you
decided.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.129
I decided I-I
didn't want to.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.047
Teddy...

09:07.047 --> 09:09.174
I love her, Dad.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.633
I'm not breaking up with her.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.634
Teddy.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.136
You're not thinking straight.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.637
You got to focus
on your tennis right now.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.097
I am focusing
on my tennis.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.765
I can do both, okay?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.021
What?

09:23.021 --> 09:25.023
I don't know.
I thought you were different.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.483
I thought you were going
to be the one kid of mine

09:26.483 --> 09:28.943
that was a success.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.544
Uh, hey.
Is this a good time?

09:45.544 --> 09:46.420
Sure.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.671
Yeah. What's
going on?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.382
Well, um...

09:50.382 --> 09:52.884
Ivy and her mom are going to
Australia this summer, you know.

09:52.884 --> 09:56.596
Just for some fun.
And, um, they invited me, so....

09:56.596 --> 09:57.680
Absolutely not.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.057
Harry...

09:59.057 --> 10:01.642
No. Dixon doesn't deserve
a trip right now.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.229
What do you mean,
he doesn't deserve a trip?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.689
I mean, he's not going.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.358
Shouldn't this be
a discussion?

10:08.358 --> 10:10.026
DIXON:
You know, um...

10:10.026 --> 10:11.152
It's okay.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.446
No, no. It's not okay.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.905
I happen to think

10:13.905 --> 10:15.865
the trip sounds like
a really great opportunity

10:15.865 --> 10:18.410
if there's parental
supervision.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.536
It's not gonna happen.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.580
And in case
you've forgotten,

10:21.580 --> 10:23.081
I have a say in this, too.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.041
(sighs)

10:25.041 --> 10:27.502
DIXON: Really, please, um...
Just forget it.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.421
No, no. We're not going
to forget it.

10:29.421 --> 10:33.091
Your father and I
will discuss it like a couple.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.095
And then we will
get back to you.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.024
Javier?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.445
Hello?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.573
(chuckles)

10:56.573 --> 10:58.866
Where are you?

11:03.413 --> 11:05.999
Isn't this
theater amazing?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.042
Please, sit.

11:09.461 --> 11:13.173
(playing guitar)

11:15.049 --> 11:17.511
♪ I... ♪

11:17.511 --> 11:20.888
♪ Can't get enough
of what you do ♪

11:22.516 --> 11:27.812
♪ I'm drowning in your eyes
so blue ♪

11:27.812 --> 11:31.858
♪ My clothes are stained
in your perfume ♪

11:31.858 --> 11:34.235
♪ Oh, yeah... ♪

11:35.028 --> 11:37.696
(singing in Spanish)

11:43.411 --> 11:45.372
(knocking)

11:51.044 --> 11:52.212
Hey.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.171
Hey.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.340
What's wrong?
You okay?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.133
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.678
Uh, Teddy, I don't
think you're fine.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.055
Come on. What's going on?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.057
(sighs)

12:04.057 --> 12:05.684
It's my dad.

12:05.684 --> 12:09.479
He is such an ass,
I swear.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.898
Sometimes the only place
I feel like I can breathe

12:11.898 --> 12:13.107
is here with you.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.447
I mean it.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.449
You make me so happy, Silver.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.577
Me, too.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.538
You make me
so happy, too.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.516
(zipper unzipping)

12:51.354 --> 12:53.106
Um...

12:54.899 --> 12:56.943
I thought you
wanted to wait.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.153
I did.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.156
Now I'm ready.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.451
It just feels so right.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.218
(engine sputtering)

13:26.514 --> 13:28.015
All right.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.607
Can you believe Jen?

13:35.607 --> 13:36.941
She sent my Mercedes back

13:36.941 --> 13:38.693
and is making me drive
that hunk of junk.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.695
There was a lot of smoke
coming from the exhaust.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.821
I'll take a look at it.
I'm poor, Liam.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.324
What is there to live for?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.618
I have to get my money back.
I have to.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.411
I think Jay Boyd is the key.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.579
Who's he?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.122
That's the problem--
I don't know.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.873
There's like a dozen Jay Boyds
in the phone book,

13:52.873 --> 13:54.459
but I have to find
the right one--

13:54.459 --> 13:55.794
the one that made Jen
all jittery and suspicious.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.045
Or you could just wait
until you turn 18

13:58.045 --> 13:59.213
when you get it
back anyway.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.590
Are you insane?

14:00.590 --> 14:01.882
I can't live like a pauper
for six months.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.510
Come on, you're not
exactly a pauper.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.261
I can't shop. I can't spa.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.846
I might as well eat fast food
out of the trash can.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.599
Naomi, come on.

14:09.599 --> 14:13.019
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
you're being so unsympathetic.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.270
I need your support.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.730
I need you to be
here for me.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.608
You have got to
be kidding me.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.901
All I am is there for you.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.903
In fact, if anyone
hasn't been here, it's you.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.989
What are you...
what are you talking about?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.575
The fact that you have no idea
what's going on in my life

14:27.575 --> 14:29.994
for the last month-- none.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.329
So for you to say

14:31.329 --> 14:34.541
that I'm not there...

14:34.541 --> 14:36.209
Whatever, Naomi.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.552
Mm.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.221
Hey, you ready
for bangers and mash?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.765
That's Australian
for sausage and hash browns.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.642
You know, you better
get used to the lingo,

14:52.642 --> 14:54.977
because if you can come up
with the money for a ticket,

14:54.977 --> 14:57.188
you are going.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.523
To Australia?

14:58.523 --> 15:00.567
(Australian accent):
You got it, mate.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.153
Wow. Um, so are you going to
talk like that until I leave?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.946
I'll give it a fair go.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.324
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.868
(normal voice):
You're welcome.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.035
Yes!

15:11.035 --> 15:14.622
Wait, why is everybody
staring at me?

15:14.622 --> 15:16.916
Oh, I don't know.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.459
Could have something to do

15:18.459 --> 15:20.920
with the limo that pulled
up to school yesterday.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.047
Which brings me
to my next question.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.174
Would you be open to doing
an interview with the Blaze

15:25.174 --> 15:27.343
about what it's like
recording with Javier?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.969
Lila was going to ask
you to do the story,

15:28.969 --> 15:30.805
but she's laying low
on all things Blaze

15:30.805 --> 15:32.515
since the breakup with Navid.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.851
Wait, Navid and Lila broke up?

15:34.851 --> 15:36.728
Yeah.
When?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.772
I don't know...
like a week ago.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.648
Why wouldn't he tell me that?

15:40.648 --> 15:43.067
Why would he tell you that?

15:43.067 --> 15:44.235
No, you're right.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.986
I guess there's no reason to...

15:45.986 --> 15:48.072
Okay, what's going on?

15:48.072 --> 15:50.867
Do you like Navid? Again?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.453
It doesn't even matter.
No, it doesn't matter.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.997
Navid and Lila have been
broken up for over a week

15:56.997 --> 15:59.417
and if he liked me,
he would have told me.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.877
Okay.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.760
Well, well, well.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.805
If it isn't
Mr. Hollywood Sign.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.640
Hey, welcome back.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.142
Really, we've all
missed you.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.312
Well, not me, but I'm sure
some junkies missed you.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.689
What, they put
a straitjacket

16:21.689 --> 16:24.484
on your tongue
in the nuthouse?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.193
He is crazy.

16:26.193 --> 16:29.405
I wouldn't be surprised
if he killed his uncle.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.825
What is wrong with you?

16:31.825 --> 16:34.285
You're pathetic.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.203
You two belong together.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.376
You didn't have to do that.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.878
I did.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.422
Jasper, all of this,
everything that's happened...

16:46.422 --> 16:49.425
I mean, it all started
with me and your uncle...

16:49.425 --> 16:50.969
Annie, it's not your fault.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.638
It is. If I hadn't...

16:53.638 --> 16:54.764
It's okay.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.516
How can you say that?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.184
You forgave me.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.435
And I forgive you.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.814
I forgive you.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.406
(knocking)

17:15.075 --> 17:16.953
Mr. Montgomery. Hi.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.829
Spence. Please.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.665
Spence. Okay.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.124
Are you looking for Teddy?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.792
Because he's not
here right now.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.921
No, actually, I'm here
to talk to you.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.548
Oh, okay.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.132
Well, come on in.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.220
Would you like something
to drink or to eat?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.596
I don't actually think
I have anything...

17:35.596 --> 17:37.515
I'm fine. Thanks.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.684
I'd like to ask you
a question.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.311
How long have you
been going out with my son?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.022
Uh, officially?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.524
A couple months, I guess.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.484
Do you know how long
he's been playing tennis?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.237
Since he was four.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.573
Wow. That's a long time.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.866
Long time.

17:54.866 --> 17:58.160
Now he's got this
one chance to go pro.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.787
One chance.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.124
Do you want to be the one
that ruins that for him?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.710
Me?

18:05.710 --> 18:08.254
Yeah, your relationship
is starting to get in the way.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.090
He's losing focus.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.051
So tell me something.
How much is it

18:13.051 --> 18:14.677
going to cost
to get you

18:14.677 --> 18:16.679
to walk away?

18:16.679 --> 18:18.514
What?

18:18.514 --> 18:20.349
$100,000.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.978
(gasps)

18:23.978 --> 18:25.104
$150?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.774
No, no, I think...

18:27.774 --> 18:29.817
I think you should leave.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.069
Please.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.531
If you love my son,

18:35.531 --> 18:37.450
don't get in the way
of his dream.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.218
Hey.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.096
Hi.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
Looks good.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.183
Thanks.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.104
Look, Liam,
you were right.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.857
I've been entirely too
wrapped up in my own life.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.526
But I want to be here
for you. I do.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.947
I screwed up.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.531
But I'm here now.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.328
And I promise
it will not happen again.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.251
Come on.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.711
Tell me what's going on.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.632
My dad came back.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.883
What? I thought he was in...

19:35.883 --> 19:36.968
He got out.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.385
Early parole.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.637
He just showed up here

19:39.637 --> 19:41.597
talking about how he
wanted a relationship.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.683
He did?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.602
What happened?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.146
He took off.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.565
I'm sorry, Liam.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.526
Whatever. I'm fine.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.862
I know you're fine.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.989
I can't believe
I wasn't there for you.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.993
It's okay.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.078
It's not okay.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.831
But like I said,
it won't happen again.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.082
You can trust me.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.126
Poor people tend
to be honorable.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.293
(laughing)

20:17.800 --> 20:20.928
Dude, you've got to stop
torturing yourself.

20:20.928 --> 20:26.767
"Romantic night for Javianna."

20:26.767 --> 20:29.145
"Javianna?" Really?

20:29.145 --> 20:30.229
(knocking)

20:32.314 --> 20:33.858
Hey.
Hey.

20:33.858 --> 20:34.817
What's up?

20:34.817 --> 20:35.860
Um, nothing.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.319
I was just looking for Silver.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.780
Oh, uh, she's-she's not here.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.115
Oh, okay.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.534
Thanks.
Yeah.

20:43.534 --> 20:47.538
Um, so I hear
you and Lila broke up.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.666
Oh, uh, yep. Yeah, that we did.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.001
No, but it's cool.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.128
You know, I'm glad to be free.

20:54.128 --> 20:57.464
You know me, I'm not one
to be tied down.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.341
So, how about you?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.676
Javianna?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.511
Oh, my God, you saw that?

21:02.511 --> 21:03.846
No, I didn't.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.473
No, I did.
Because Dixon showed it to me.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.268
So yeah, I did see it,
indirectly.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.063
Let me just say that I'm
really happy for you, Ade.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.190
I mean, Javier...

21:14.190 --> 21:16.567
Javier-- he seems like
such a terrific guy.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.527
Talented, handsome.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.072
He seems like one of those
guys with the, uh,

21:21.072 --> 21:22.740
washboard abs. Am I right?

21:23.532 --> 21:26.035
Um, yeah, I guess so.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.370
Dude, I knew it!
(snapping fingers)

21:28.370 --> 21:30.164
You go, girl!

21:30.164 --> 21:33.042
Uh, tomorrow is
my first solo show,

21:33.042 --> 21:34.961
so in case you want to come.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.462
Oh, cool.

21:36.462 --> 21:41.217
Yeah, I'll run it through
the, uh... old calendario.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.718
Okay.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.844
Bye.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.266
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:48.266 --> 21:49.850
Did I let on that I had
too many feelings?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.435
No, no, not at all.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.353
You let on that you have
feelings for Javier.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.730
And his washboard abs.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.067
Dude, she...
she doesn't like me, all right?

21:58.067 --> 22:00.486
See, how can I compete
with a guy like that?

22:00.486 --> 22:03.156
I can't serenade her
in some fancy theater.

22:03.156 --> 22:06.366
My rabbi made me lip-synch the
Torah portion at my bar mitzvah.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.327
All right. Look. I'm sorry.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.831
But you have something that
Javier can't sing about, man.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.583
You have a history
with Adrianna.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.128
Dude, you guys
were in love, man.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.796
So tap into that.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.756
And, uh, make your play already.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.386
Yeah.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.932
Yeah.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.693
(cheering and applause)

22:47.074 --> 22:48.784
Match point.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.923
(cheering and whistling)

23:05.009 --> 23:07.636
Good game.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.433
Let's go. Let's go.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.316
175.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.110
Dude, I can't go any
lower than 200.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.362
Look, look, man.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.780
This represents
two years of my life.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.282
Carefully cultivated.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.868
All right, I got a playlist
for every occasion.

23:30.868 --> 23:34.288
And I'm throwing in my
dock, dude. Come on.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.331
Oh, wow.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.624
Annie's Sweet 16 party mix.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.168
Yeah, that was me.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.754
Ah, what the hell?

23:42.713 --> 23:43.839
Ooh-ooh.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.300
DIXON:
Thank you, man.
Yeah.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.136
Hey.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.847
What-What was that all about?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.015
Making money, baby.

23:53.015 --> 23:56.018
$600 in a day,
to be exact.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.395
Why are you selling
all your stuff?

23:57.395 --> 23:59.021
For our trip
to Australia.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.273
My parents said
if I could come up

24:00.273 --> 24:01.857
with the money
for the ticket,

24:01.857 --> 24:03.359
I can go, so, uh...

24:03.359 --> 24:04.777
I'm coming up
with the money.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.528
By selling all your stuff?

24:06.528 --> 24:09.323
(laughs) Look, honestly,
this trip to Australia

24:09.323 --> 24:12.576
is the only thing
I'm focusing on right now.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.453
I mean, with everything
going on with my parents,

24:15.453 --> 24:19.625
going on this trip and, uh,
spending my summer with you...

24:19.625 --> 24:21.043
It means everything to me.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.855
I'm so sorry.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.565
I just lost my #1 ranking,

24:43.565 --> 24:45.525
which means I just screwed up
my draw at nationals,

24:45.525 --> 24:47.485
which means I just
threw away everything

24:47.485 --> 24:50.448
I've been working for
for the past three years.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.993
I shouldn't have lost.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.078
I mean, I've beaten
that kid twice.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.580
Maybe-Maybe he got better.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.540
No.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.252
I shouldn't have stayed up
so late last night.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.962
I should have gone to bed.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.094
Teddy, um...

25:14.138 --> 25:15.973
This isn't working.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.019
Our relationship. It's...

25:20.019 --> 25:22.480
It's too much for me and...

25:22.480 --> 25:25.691
It's gotten too serious.
It's not what I wanted.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.525
I've been thinking
about this for a while,

25:27.525 --> 25:30.446
and I just wanted to wait
until after your match.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.738
I'm sorry.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.866
No. Silver, wait!

25:52.134 --> 25:54.428
You're gonna knock
'em dead, you know?

25:54.428 --> 25:57.264
(laughs)
Thank you.
(knocking)

25:58.015 --> 25:59.475
Oh, my God. Stop kissing

25:59.475 --> 26:02.311
or I might take a picture
and send it to Perez.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.646
Okay, well, on that note,
I should probably go.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.815
Wait, what? You're not staying
for Ade's first real gig?

26:06.815 --> 26:09.151
Javier has to go to New York.
He has a gig tomorrow.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.570
Good luck.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.572
Thank you.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.784
(laughing)

26:17.784 --> 26:19.619
It's a full house out there.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.829
Really?
Yes!

26:20.829 --> 26:22.873
So, uh, um...

26:22.873 --> 26:24.041
Did Navid come?

26:24.041 --> 26:25.792
I didn't see him, actually.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.086
Oh, no.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.504
Navid again? Really?

26:28.504 --> 26:30.423
No. There is no "Navid again."

26:30.423 --> 26:32.425
I mean, he's moved on.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.634
And so have I.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.220
Mmm.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.560
Dude.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.852
What took you so long?

26:43.852 --> 26:45.687
Dude, I had
to pick this up.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.022
Whoa.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.775
Listen. Um, Navid, look.
Uh, I like you,

26:49.775 --> 26:51.693
but me and Ivy, we kind
of got a good thing...

26:51.693 --> 26:54.238
Just shut up.
It's for Ade, okay?

26:54.238 --> 26:55.448
Making my play, bro.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.823
Like you said,
we have history.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.117
I just, uh, need
to remind her

26:58.117 --> 26:59.910
that no one else knows her
like I do.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.662
So, uh, here's
the 11 and a six

27:02.662 --> 27:05.082
because we first kissed
on the sixth of November.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.376
And here's her
favorite flower.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.086
(in baby voice):
A little tulip.

27:09.086 --> 27:12.672
And, uh...her favorite food:
a little hamburger

27:12.672 --> 27:14.091
with tiny, tiny pickles on it.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.052
(laughs)
Cool.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.472
Um...
Just do me a favor.

27:19.472 --> 27:22.766
When you actually give it
to her, lose the baby voice.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.394
Gotcha. But I'm not
gonna give it to her.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.396
I'm going to put it
in her dressing room

27:27.396 --> 27:28.355
while she's performing,

27:28.355 --> 27:30.274
with a note on it that says,

27:30.274 --> 27:32.318
"Meet me on the roof."

27:32.318 --> 27:33.819
Why the roof?

27:33.819 --> 27:35.362
Well, Ade's favorite movie
is An Affair to Remember.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.989
And there's this, like,
super-romantic scene

27:36.989 --> 27:38.240
where they're supposed
to meet on the roof

27:38.240 --> 27:39.158
of the Empire State Building.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.784
How cute is this?

27:40.784 --> 27:43.454
(baby voice):
A little, mini
Empire State Building.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.540
Dude. The voice.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.375
Uh, yeah. Whatever.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.836
Uh, wish me luck, bro.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.045
Gotcha.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.131

Uh... what's wrong?

28:54.774 --> 28:57.194
Okay, look. Dixon.
I've just...

28:57.194 --> 28:59.530
I've been thinking,
and I really don't think

28:59.530 --> 29:01.114
you should be selling all
your stuff to come to Australia.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.033
I just think it's a little
extreme, don't you think?

29:03.033 --> 29:05.118
I mean, how else am I
going to get the money?

29:05.118 --> 29:07.413
We're not all rich, you know?

29:07.413 --> 29:09.998
And what do you mean by that?

29:09.998 --> 29:12.668
Are you, like, implying
that I'm spoiled or something?

29:12.668 --> 29:14.169
No. No. That's not what I meant.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.129
That's kind of exactly
what it sounded like, Dixon.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.799
I mean, I'm sorry
that my mom has money.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.093
And I'm sorry my parents don't.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.554
You see? This is
kind of exactly why

29:23.554 --> 29:25.097
you shouldn't be
selling your stuff.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.682
I'm sorry. What?

29:26.682 --> 29:27.849
What do you mean, "what"?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.268
Dixon, look at us.
We're fighting.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.769
Yeah, because you're
being all judgmental.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.146
Oh. Okay. So now, all of
a sudden I'm judgmental?

29:33.146 --> 29:34.940
You know what?
If that's what you think,

29:34.940 --> 29:36.900
then you just really shouldn't
be coming to Australia at all.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.152
Fine. Then maybe we
shouldn't be dating at all.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.654
Wow.

29:40.654 --> 29:41.905
Okay.

29:41.905 --> 29:46.660
♪ I'm in love, love, love. ♪

29:48.245 --> 29:51.123
Okay, so, for the visual part
of the presentation,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.083
I thought we could use
some visual aids.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.918
I mean, obviously,
we'll use a portrait,

29:54.918 --> 29:57.671
but maybe we could actually
take one of Vivaldi's scores

29:57.671 --> 29:59.798
and blow it up really big.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.175
What?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.885
(sighs)

30:03.885 --> 30:05.554
Look, I don't know
if this is my place or not,

30:05.554 --> 30:08.557
but I saw you with Jasper
the other day...

30:08.557 --> 30:09.558
Oh.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.727
Annie, the guy
is a psycho.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.604
No, he's not.
He just...

30:13.604 --> 30:15.355
He snapped.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.107
But everything's okay now.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.443
All right? He apologized to me.

30:19.443 --> 30:20.819
You can't really be serious.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.530
Look, please, just let's
not talk about Jasper.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.407
I know what I'm doing.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.493
So, will you, um,

30:27.493 --> 30:29.202
pull up the written
part on my laptop

30:29.202 --> 30:30.746
while I look
through our notes?

30:30.746 --> 30:32.122
Yeah, sure.

30:32.122 --> 30:33.457
What'd you call it?

30:33.457 --> 30:35.751
Uh... "Vivaldi,"
I think.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.253
Well, here's a, uh,
untitled document.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.588
Hmm.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.844
What just happened?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.929
Nothing. Um...

30:47.929 --> 30:50.516
Look, I don't feel like
doing work anymore, okay?

30:51.975 --> 30:52.934
Okay.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.020
That's fine.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.438
I'll just
get out of here.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.535
Having fun?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.870
Uh, not really. No.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.666
Me and Ivy just
got into a fight.

31:15.666 --> 31:18.960
And, um, I think we broke up.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.588
Ah. Seems to be a lot
of that going around.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.631
Hmm.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.675
Me and Teddy...

31:24.675 --> 31:27.010
We kind of broke up, too.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.470
Really?

31:29.555 --> 31:30.681
I'm sorry.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.474
It sucks.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.518
Yeah. It really sucks.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.353
Hey, Dixon!

31:36.353 --> 31:39.398
My man!
Your music library?

31:39.398 --> 31:40.982
It's friggin'
awesome, dude.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.818
And I'm not just saying that
'cause I'm drunk.

31:42.818 --> 31:43.943
(laughing)

31:43.943 --> 31:45.362
Uh, good to know, man.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.780
But I am!

31:46.780 --> 31:48.407
I'm seriously wasted!

31:48.407 --> 31:49.616
Oh.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.201
You guys want some vodka?

31:51.201 --> 31:52.619
Uh...

31:52.619 --> 31:54.830
Sure. Why not?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.956
Oh.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.792
Okay.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.586
Mademoiselle?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.671
Sure.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.465
Cheers.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.925
Cheers.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.311
Hey. What are you
doing out here?

32:18.311 --> 32:20.355
I don't know.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.401
Okay. What's wrong, hon?

32:24.401 --> 32:26.361
I broke up with Dixon.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.113
What? Why?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.823
Last I heard, he was
coming away with us.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.450
I know, I know.
But, you know,

32:31.450 --> 32:32.826
then he starts selling
all of his stuff

32:32.826 --> 32:34.953
to pay for his ticket, and...

32:34.953 --> 32:37.205
And?

32:37.205 --> 32:40.208
And I don't know.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.168
It just suddenly became, like,
the biggest thing in his life.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.503
You know, it was
all he could talk about.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.088
I mean, what if we get
to Australia and,

32:45.088 --> 32:46.799
you know, we don't
even get along?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.425
Well, then, we'll
just have to drive him

32:48.425 --> 32:49.802
to the Outback and ditch him.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.386
It's not funny.

32:51.386 --> 32:56.015
Or we could take him
to the airport.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.225
You freaked out, huh?

32:57.225 --> 32:58.852
I totally freaked out.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.439
I get why you're freaked out,

33:02.439 --> 33:05.651
but, Ivy, sweetie,
instead of picking a fight,

33:05.651 --> 33:07.945
you know, maybe you could
have talked to Dixon

33:07.945 --> 33:10.697
about how you
were feeling...

33:10.697 --> 33:12.491
right?

33:12.491 --> 33:13.784
(both laugh)

33:14.952 --> 33:17.245
Oh...

33:17.245 --> 33:19.414
Shh!

33:20.666 --> 33:22.960
Are you sure the
bathroom is this way?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.169
(laughs)

33:24.169 --> 33:26.338
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
for sure.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.547
No clue?

33:27.547 --> 33:28.423
Not a one.
(laughs)

33:28.423 --> 33:29.758
Not a one.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.343
(both laugh)

33:31.343 --> 33:33.136
Oh, wait.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.429
Here it is!
Ah!

33:34.429 --> 33:36.473
Ladies first.
Thanks.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.600
(laughs)

33:39.726 --> 33:40.727
Dixon, one question.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.895
Huh?

33:41.895 --> 33:43.104
What is it
about this place

33:43.104 --> 33:44.439
that says
"Ladies' Room" to you?

33:44.439 --> 33:45.482
What?

33:45.482 --> 33:46.900
(giggles)

33:46.900 --> 33:48.234
It's a broom closet!

33:48.234 --> 33:49.903
You sent me to go
to the bathroom

33:49.903 --> 33:51.112
in a broom closet!

33:51.112 --> 33:52.906
Okay, okay,
guilty as charged.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.074
Let's, let's go.
Wait-wait-wait.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.702
Can I say one thing
before we leave

33:56.702 --> 33:57.911
our broom closet
forever?

33:57.911 --> 34:00.163
Forever! (laughs)

34:00.163 --> 34:03.166
Ivy's an idiot
for breaking up with you

34:03.166 --> 34:08.005
because you, Dixon Wilson,
you are a great guy.

34:08.005 --> 34:10.007
(scoffs)
Oh, stop.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.591
Thank you.
Yeah.
(hands slap)

34:11.591 --> 34:14.594
And, uh, I mean,
I have to say, too, uh, Teddy

34:14.594 --> 34:17.389
is a complete idiot

34:17.389 --> 34:19.766
because you, Miss Erin Silver...

34:19.766 --> 34:21.768
(giggles)

34:21.768 --> 34:23.478
you are a great girl.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.478
Thank you!

34:24.478 --> 34:25.731
(both laugh)

34:25.731 --> 34:27.815
No problem,
no problem.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.612
Mmm...

34:41.830 --> 34:44.917
Listen...
No, no, this is a total...
it was a mistake.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.210
Total, total mistake 'cause...

34:47.210 --> 34:49.504
Yeah, yeah.
...we're both drunk.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.340
Exact. Totally drunk, and, um,

34:52.340 --> 34:53.759
to-totally idiotic.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.761
(laughs)
Totally idiotic! So it never...

34:55.761 --> 34:57.387
Yeah, yeah, nothing.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.346
Never happened.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.890
Never happened.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.642
Okay.
Yeah, uh,
ladies first.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.477
All right.

35:09.566 --> 35:12.569
Hey, Dixon, can I, um...?

35:12.569 --> 35:13.820
can I talk to you for a second?

35:13.820 --> 35:14.863
Uh...

35:14.863 --> 35:16.239
I'll see you later.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.282
Sure.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.285
Okay, look, I messed up, okay?

35:20.285 --> 35:22.495
I know. I just...

35:22.495 --> 35:24.414
I don't even know.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.125
I guess I'm kind of this...

35:27.125 --> 35:29.669
you know, no-strings-attached
kind of girl,

35:29.669 --> 35:32.130
and, and somehow in my mind,

35:32.130 --> 35:35.926
Australia just kinda
became like this marriage.

35:35.926 --> 35:39.054
No offense or anything,
but to me, it was just a trip.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.221
Right.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.974
A chance to get away
for a summer

35:41.974 --> 35:45.351
with a cool girl and maybe
see a kangaroo or something.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.938
I know. I just freaked out.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.564
But...

35:49.564 --> 35:53.777
I do really want you to come
if you still want to.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.361
Come here.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.906
ADRIANNA (in distance):
♪ Want you to stick to me ♪

35:57.906 --> 36:01.576
♪ Like glue to prove
my love for you ♪

36:01.576 --> 36:06.164
♪ Want you to stick to me
like glue ♪

36:06.164 --> 36:09.668
♪ To prove my love for you. ♪

36:09.668 --> 36:11.711
(cheering)

36:18.677 --> 36:20.137
Hey.
Good job.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.973
Hey, you were great out there.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.641
Thank you.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.895
Amazing!

36:28.895 --> 36:31.148
What are you still
doing here?!

36:31.148 --> 36:33.232
I thought you had to catch
a plane to New York.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.443
One of the perks
of private planes.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.611
I stayed for
the first song,

36:36.611 --> 36:37.821
and I just
couldn't leave.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.280
Oh, stop it.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.825
No, really.
Which got me thinking.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.869
How'd you like
to come to New York

36:43.869 --> 36:46.913
and perform
our duet onstage?

36:46.913 --> 36:48.456
You're kidding, right?

36:48.456 --> 36:50.792
No, there's a car outside,
but we have to leave now.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.752
Now? As in now now?

36:52.752 --> 36:55.005
As in five minutes
ago now.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.631
What about my stuff?

36:56.631 --> 36:58.257
My assistant will pack
your dressing room

36:58.257 --> 36:59.759
and make sure everything
is in the hotel,

36:59.759 --> 37:00.844
and anything else
you need

37:00.844 --> 37:03.555
we'll just buy
in New York.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.890
You in?

37:04.890 --> 37:06.850
Yeah, I'm in.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.476
I am totally in!

37:08.476 --> 37:10.353
Let's go.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.689
(giggles)

37:25.368 --> 37:30.832
(crowd screaming and clamoring)

37:36.046 --> 37:38.506
We're off to New York!
Come out and see us there!

37:58.651 --> 38:02.488
Hey, Dixon. Hey.
What's up, Dad?

38:02.488 --> 38:05.242
How could you even ask
if you could go to Australia?

38:05.242 --> 38:07.911
What were you thinking?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.829
Well, look,
I thought it would be

38:09.829 --> 38:11.330
a great opportunity,

38:11.330 --> 38:13.959
and Mom told me that you and her
talked about it...

38:13.959 --> 38:16.169
Yeah, yeah, we did, and of
course, she said you could go

38:16.169 --> 38:17.420
because she doesn't know
what happened.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.131
She doesn't know
about the gambling,

38:19.131 --> 38:20.632
about the breaking
into school.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.968
Well, then maybe you should
tell me about it.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.928
(sighs)

38:28.514 --> 38:30.308
How's the surfing going?

38:30.308 --> 38:31.893
How's it going?

38:31.893 --> 38:34.020
Yeah, I mean, have you learned
any new tricks recently?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.313
I mean, I don't
really do tricks.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.440
(phone rings)

38:37.440 --> 38:39.025
What's all this
interest in surfing?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.359
Ooh, potential housekeeper.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.070
I'll call her back
after lunch.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.529
What do you mean?
We have Rosa.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.948
Why would we need
another housekeeper?

38:44.948 --> 38:47.742
Oh, we, uh, we had
to let Rosa go.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.327
What? Why?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.579
She stole some coins
from Jeffrey's collection.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.918
I...

38:56.918 --> 38:59.712
I don't think
that could be true.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.966
I mean, it can't be.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.136
(phone rings)

39:06.136 --> 39:07.179
NAOMI:
Hello?

39:07.179 --> 39:09.848
LIAM:
Hey, it's me.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.308
Look, can I see you?

39:11.308 --> 39:12.934
I really need to talk.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.480
Naomi?

39:19.941 --> 39:21.484
Naomi?

39:21.484 --> 39:24.737
Yeah, listen, um...
can we talk later?

39:24.737 --> 39:26.990
I'm actually in bed.
I think I have the flu.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.201
Are you okay?
Do you need anything?

39:29.201 --> 39:31.911
Just rest.
I'll call you back, okay?

39:31.911 --> 39:33.663
All right.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.500
(horn blares)

39:38.668 --> 39:42.005
Up yours, loser!

39:45.508 --> 39:47.385
(phone rings)

39:51.556 --> 39:52.682
Hey.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.017
Hey.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.935
Listen, I'm really sorry

39:55.935 --> 39:57.603
that I butted
into your business last night.

39:57.603 --> 40:01.274
No, no, um, I'm sorry
I overreacted.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.276
I was just in a bad mood.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.862
No, it's fine.
It happens.

40:05.862 --> 40:09.074
Listen, I could really use
your advice.

40:09.074 --> 40:12.785
Can we meet in the park?
Of course.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.954
All right.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.497
Bye.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.052
Uh, what are you doing here?

40:29.052 --> 40:31.429
More to the point,
what are you doing here?

40:32.389 --> 40:35.725
Oh, so you must be Jay Boyd?
(chuckles)

40:35.725 --> 40:38.103
Are you having an affair
with my sister?

40:38.103 --> 40:39.854
God, no.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.190
No offense, sweetie.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.566
Naomi, this is my

40:43.566 --> 40:45.777
new assistant Leo.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.447
Well, who's Jay Boyd then?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.823
Why'd you act like
you were hiding something

40:50.823 --> 40:52.033
when he called you on the phone?

40:52.033 --> 40:53.659
Jennifer Clark?

40:53.659 --> 40:55.912
Dr. Boyd will see you now.

40:55.912 --> 40:59.498
Okay, thank you.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.876
Because, Naomi,
I was hiding something.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.836
You got me.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.922
Jay Boyd is my OB.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.051
Surprise!

41:10.051 --> 41:12.304
(laughs)

41:12.304 --> 41:14.097
You're gonna be an auntie.
