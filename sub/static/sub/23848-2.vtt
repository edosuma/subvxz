00:17.080 --> 00:18.320
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:20.520
<i>Gereon Rath.</i>

00:20.640 --> 00:22.000
Can't get rid of you, huh?

00:22.080 --> 00:24.360
They've got König.
He didn't destroy the film.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.960
But I explicitly told him to.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.120
Krajewski? He used to be one of us.
A police officer.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.080
<i>He honestly thought he could just go back</i>
<i>to working after the war.</i>

00:33.160 --> 00:34.480
<i>A trembler.</i>

00:34.600 --> 00:36.640
<i>You know what I'm looking for.</i>
<i>Where is the film?</i>

00:36.720 --> 00:39.480
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

00:39.560 --> 00:44.200
I have been told that our mutual friend
is doing business for his own account.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.760
The train crossed the border this morning.
There were no problems.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.560
It's going straight to Berlin!

00:50.960 --> 00:51.720
You're my hero.

01:14.080 --> 01:20.080
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
DETENTION CELL WING, MITTE, BERLIN

02:01.920 --> 02:03.240
Hello, König.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.200
What do you want?

02:08.840 --> 02:10.000
Pray.

02:24.640 --> 02:30.400
Lord... God of revenge... appear.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.760
Repeat after me.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.440
You are my Lord and God.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.560
You are my Lord and God.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.200
You watch over me.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.320
You watch over me.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.080
Even in the darkness of my dungeon...

02:53.520 --> 02:55.960
Even in the darkness of my dungeon...

02:56.040 --> 02:58.280
...I know your strict hand is above me.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.240
...I know your strict hand is above me.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.400
Your wrath is deserved.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.080
Your wrath is deserved.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.280
Your revenge is terrible.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.960
Your revenge is terrible.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.640
I'm sorry,
but when a picture is so ruined...

04:41.160 --> 04:43.360
If you had the negative,
I could work with that.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.080
But I don't have it.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.560
Was it a professional photographer,
I mean cameraman?

04:49.040 --> 04:49.880
Why?

04:50.280 --> 04:51.680
It's very thinly lit.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.040
It's a miracle
you can see anything at all. It was taken secretly.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.880
Very well. When it's finished,
where may I deliver it to, Inspector?

05:02.960 --> 05:04.360
I'll take it now.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.840
-And, Mr...
-Gräf.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.880
Don't tell anyone about this.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.640
You have never seen this picture.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.560
Gereon.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.840
I have something for you.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.760
Well, our 14 is on the ball.
Went down the shaft right away.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.160
Barrel calibrated and cleaned,
everything spick-and-span.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.360
Bruno, we could interrogate
the man together.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.760
I won't get involved.
Don't worry.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.400
One has to let Polly out of jail.
I'm off.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.400
Where is the film?

06:29.960 --> 06:33.080
Come on,
blackmail is a little ambitious for you.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.680
Tell me who your clients are,

06:38.760 --> 06:41.400
where the film is, and you can go.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.520
I need some fresh air.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.480
Please.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.240
I can't breathe.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.080
Very good idea. And now? Close your eyes.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.640
And then?

07:19.600 --> 07:20.960
You won't get out of here.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.360
Not alive.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.960
Close your eyes.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.400
Think about it, König.
We're not after you.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.280
-You have nothing to worry about.
-Close your eyes!

07:38.320 --> 07:39.160
No. GENTS

08:38.760 --> 08:40.960
GENTS

09:24.920 --> 09:27.080
What happened? Can you hear me?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.200
What? I can't understand.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.160
Inside pocket.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.480
This? Do you want this?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.200
How much? One?

09:56.920 --> 09:57.760
Good?

10:22.840 --> 10:24.000
I'll get help.

10:27.040 --> 10:27.960
Please.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.240
But you are bleeding.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.400
It's not mine.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.920
Am I wrong here or is it you?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.360
Do you how many men's restrooms
there are in headquarters?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.120
Fifty-two.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.800
And how many ladies'?

11:09.200 --> 11:10.640
May I ask you a favor?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.680
-You don't have to. I get it.
-You do?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.200
I'm Charlotte Ritter.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.280
-Rath, Gereon.
-Gereon?

11:27.080 --> 11:28.800
Where are you from, the Middle Ages?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.280
From Cologne.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.280
I'll manage on my own.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.160
Are you sure?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.400
Yes.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.520
Alright.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.560
I'll close the door, OK?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.040
Drive on, please.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.920
Do you have the papers?

12:27.400 --> 12:28.560
Very good.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.840
CONSIGNMENT NOTE

12:37.200 --> 12:39.280
You have to put
the number of the car here.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.600
AB 32-2-1.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.920
And here the destination station.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.200
Istanbul.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.800
Everyone at the printer's is ready.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.040
Tomorrow, a new chapter
will begin for the Russian people.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.880
And you made it possible.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.440
And you will finish it.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.600
Kardakov...

13:17.880 --> 13:19.400
I love you.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.000
And I you.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.280
A call to Cologne.
Thirteen-zero-eight. Thank you.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.240
<i>Hello?</i>

14:08.600 --> 14:09.840
It's me.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.640
-G<i>ereon?</i>
-Can you talk?

14:14.000 --> 14:14.840
<i>Yes.</i>

14:16.040 --> 14:17.240
König is dead.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.600
<i>-Do you have the material?</i>
-No.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.600
-Just one single picture.
-<i>What? No film?</i>

14:26.040 --> 14:27.080
Not yet.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.600
<i>You know about your responsibility.</i>
<i>You must destroy the film.</i>

14:32.680 --> 14:35.000
<i>Nobody can know it exists. Gereon.</i>

14:35.080 --> 14:37.120
Man, where have you been?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.000
What happened?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.480
He grabbed my gun.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.640
-They're expecting us.
-Who are they?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.560
The political department.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.760
-Benda?
-In person. Come on.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.440
Yes, I understand.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.080
Yes, of course.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.120
Goodbye.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.720
-Wolter, Rath. He's expecting us.
-Please.

15:31.040 --> 15:31.920
Councillor.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.160
How could you let this happen?
You knew König.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.720
You were sent here because
you've been trailing this guy for weeks.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.000
You must have known what he's capable of.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.240
The inspector has not acted negligently...

15:47.320 --> 15:48.960
Nobody is asking you, Wolter!

15:52.640 --> 15:54.440
You interrogated him yesterday.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.520
Together with the chief inspector.
Yesterday afternoon.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.520
-And the wounds?
-Pardon?

16:00.600 --> 16:06.520
This file here says that König arrived
at the detention center with injuries.

16:07.080 --> 16:07.920
How come?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.440
He tried to resist arrest by escaping.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.120
Please excuse us, gentlemen.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.440
Mr. Wolter, in private, please.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.720
Take a seat, inspector.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.600
It would be disastrous in your position
to keep something from me.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.400
I am aware of that.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.240
I phoned Cologne earlier.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.920
Your father told me
you would explain everything.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.800
The Lord Mayor of Cologne
is being blackmailed.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.640
Dr. Adenauer. My most senior employer.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.640
The affair is unsavory.
To be dealt with before the elections.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.000
Blackmailed. By König?

17:15.680 --> 17:16.800
I knew König.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.840
A stuck-up, arrogant chap.
Until this morning.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.400
-He was changed. A different guy.
-Meaning?

17:26.720 --> 17:28.480
I think there is a contracting entity.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.600
Here in Berlin.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.640
Where is this film?
Do you have any leads yet?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.160
Yes.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.920
Good. Don't lose any time.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.040
And as far as the incident
with König is concerned,

17:43.120 --> 17:46.440
leave the apparatus in the castle,
the press and Wolter to me.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.240
-Cigarette?
-Please.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.520
Your father mentioned you have
a personal connection with Dr. Adenauer?

18:02.440 --> 18:05.920
My mother died immediately after the war.
From Spanish flu. Dr. Adenauer took good care
of the concerns of the family.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.480
He was a strong support for both my father
and me during a very difficult time.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.160
Where do you stay, Rath?

18:22.160 --> 18:25.280
Nowhere since this morning,
my hotel is fully booked.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.920
We'll take care of it.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.040
-Are you Catholic?
-Yes.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.840
Do come to mass on Sunday.
St Antonius in Friedenau.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.680
-I play the organ.
-I'd love to.

18:42.760 --> 18:46.640
And Mr. Wolter, please provide
our colleague with accommodation.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.800
-Long-term.
-Will do.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.040
-Behnke speaking.
-El<i>isabeth.</i>

18:57.120 --> 18:59.000
<i>It's Bruno. I need a room.</i>

18:59.400 --> 19:01.880
<i>-</i>For when?
-<i>Immediately, ideally.</i>

19:02.960 --> 19:06.160
The balcony room has just been vacated.
I need to prepare it.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.920
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>It's for a colleague of mine.</i>

19:09.000 --> 19:13.040
Thanks, Bruno. Send the gentleman over,
the room will be ready in two hours.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.000
ALEXEY KARDAKOV EVERY FRIDAY
JULY TO SEPTEMBER 1928

19:30.920 --> 19:34.440
<i>It's six marks a week. If you pay</i>
<i>for a whole month, it's cheaper.</i>

19:34.640 --> 19:36.880
Elisabeth will explain it all to you.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.000
-Who?
-Behnke, your landlady.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.360
She's the widow of a mate.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.560
Jänicke?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.840
Now go to your new pad.
And tomorrow come over for dinner at ours.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.920
Alright, thanks.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.440
-Chief?
-Can you drive?

19:52.760 --> 19:55.120
-I beg your pardon?
-Drive a car? Vroom, vroom?

19:56.040 --> 19:56.880
Yes.

19:59.320 --> 20:04.800
Staff car. Take this suitcase
and this inspector to 25 Bayreuther St.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.200
You'll bring the car back washed.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.200
Yes, sir.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.200
Why are you still standing here
looking helpless? Go.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.840
It's great that everything runs
so smoothly around here.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.760
-Let me take that.
-Thanks.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.600
-Please take me to Hermannplatz first.
-Right now?

20:41.000 --> 20:41.840
Yes, please.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.880
-I'm with Wolter.
-Alright.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.840
Rabbit boy. Want to warm up some?

21:07.840 --> 21:10.680
-Copper.
-So? They're cold too.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.440
-Where's the other one?
-It's my shift.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.960
Come with me.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.360
-Have you heard?
-Sure.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.280
Stuff like that spreads like wildfire.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.480
König wasn't a guy who would kill himself.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.800
Who is afraid that König would spill?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.800
The... emperor?

21:51.320 --> 21:56.000
König was a mystery-monger. No one knew
for whom he was doing those films.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.320
But he made good money.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.680
Where did you record this?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.200
Who are the women?

22:17.600 --> 22:20.560
-This one, I know her.
-Which one?

22:21.760 --> 22:22.680
This one.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.440
That's...

22:25.920 --> 22:27.040
Mutti from Wedding.

22:45.800 --> 22:50.040
SOVIET EMBASSY
MITTE, BERLIN

22:52.000 --> 22:52.920
Hello.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.000
Follow me.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.640
Who is the leader of the group?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.280
ALEXEY KARDAKOV

23:12.360 --> 23:14.200
Alexey Kardakov.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.720
Consider it done.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.880
On behalf of the Soviet government...

23:30.280 --> 23:32.200
I thank you for your help.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.000
Comrade General. We managed
to identify the leader of the group.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.480
<i>Alexey Kardakov.</i>

23:51.800 --> 23:53.400
-Take this.
-No, I'm OK.

23:53.480 --> 23:57.640
Take it. I'm going to Istanbul tomorrow
where it's warm.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.720
Thanks.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.680
<i>We also know</i>
<i>where the counterrevolutionaries meet.</i> I have already arranged for it,
Comrade General.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.520
Thank you, Jänicke.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.000
Come on in.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.120
Breakfast is at half six, dinner is extra.
That's at six.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.200
Warm on Sundays and Wednesdays,
sandwiches the other days.

24:29.480 --> 24:33.360
I'll do the bed linen, but you have
to take care of towels and stuff.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.000
You can use the balcony as you wish,
but please air the room regularly.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.200
-Well, if that's not lucky.
-Are you superstitious?

24:47.880 --> 24:49.720
-No. You?
-No.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.080
-I'll take the room.
-On a weekly or monthly basis?

25:00.360 --> 25:01.520
-Weekly.
-Fine.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.200
I need an advance
for the first three weeks.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.120
Mr. Katelbach! Excuse me.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.560
-Mr. Katelbach?
-Yes?

25:10.640 --> 25:13.280
Have you looked at the calendar?
End of the month.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.880
One more day and you're moving out.

25:16.600 --> 25:21.320
Dear Ms. Elisabeth,
I have something very special for you.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.400
In three hours, a special show
at the Admiralspalast.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.960
A jazz opera like the other day?
No. You're not airing the room.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.680
<i>I promise you, you'll love it.</i>

25:30.920 --> 25:33.160
<i>Sell your complimentary tickets,</i>
<i>I want my rent.</i>

25:33.240 --> 25:35.560
<i>You'll get your money,</i>
<i>when I'm back from Vienna.</i>

25:35.640 --> 25:38.200
<i>Vienna again?</i>
<i>Who is paying for this trip?</i>

25:38.280 --> 25:40.040
<i>My publisher, of course.</i>

25:40.640 --> 25:44.520
<i>The government in Vienna wants to make</i>
<i>a guy from the Middle Ages chancellor</i>

25:44.600 --> 25:47.040
-and revive the corporative state...
-When will you pay?

25:48.960 --> 25:52.200
As soon as my commentary is printed,
you'll get your money.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.760
What if it doesn't get printed?

25:53.960 --> 25:57.640
That, dear Ms. Elisabeth,
is a <i>conjunctivus irrealis,</i>

25:57.720 --> 25:59.600
an impossibility.

26:01.280 --> 26:05.760
However, would it be possible in return
to have some of that delicious...

26:05.840 --> 26:07.320
First pay, then eat.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.680
Said the executioner to the delinquent.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.680
I bid you goodbye.
Your respectful servant.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.680
Good day.

26:17.000 --> 26:17.880
A journalist?

26:19.280 --> 26:22.040
-An Austrian snot.
-What's on the menu?

26:22.600 --> 26:23.440
Dumplings.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.560
-And at ours?
-What do you think?

26:27.840 --> 26:30.160
-Black pudding.
-With or without?

26:30.240 --> 26:32.080
Without you? That would be nice.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.360
Get going, we need briquettes.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.120
Bloody bitches.

26:39.720 --> 26:43.080
Jesus, Karlchen, get on the bench!
Do I have to write it on your forehead?

26:44.600 --> 26:45.560
Now!

26:48.200 --> 26:50.840
What's up with you
going off over nothing today?

26:51.680 --> 26:53.960
-Haven't slept all night.
-Why not?

26:54.640 --> 26:56.480
Mother was coughing, Erich was puking,

26:56.560 --> 26:59.160
Grandpa wet the bed, Toni was crying,

26:59.240 --> 27:01.440
Magda was yelling,
Karlchen had diarrhea.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.600
-And Lotte wasn't home, as always.
-But I got the sausage.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.600
-And how was school today?
-It was nothing.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.680
-You didn't actually go, right?
-I did.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.320
-You were at the spinning mill.
-Just a few hours.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.760
They needed someone.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.240
-How much?
-One fifty.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.080
-Who has it?
-Ilse, of course.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.680
If you go to work,
you won't keep up in school.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.160
Finished. As good as new, madam.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.040
Don't distract, madam.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.600
-Dolly.
-Yes, Mother?

27:45.120 --> 27:48.280
You need to rub
some rubbing alcohol on me.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.720
Grandpa!

28:05.720 --> 28:08.720
...your money
and very soon we own the world!

28:08.800 --> 28:12.960
Banks eat up your money
and very soon we own the world!

28:13.040 --> 28:16.880
Banks eat up your money
and very soon we own the world...

28:26.080 --> 28:27.720
-Good evening, Charlotte.
-Good evening.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.720
Thank you.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.480
Hello there. Put some in?

28:57.760 --> 28:58.600
Thank you.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.200
It has to be you.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.080
Oh, Saint Gereon of Cologne.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.200
-Good evening, Mr. Döhmann.
-Robert, do me a favor

29:38.280 --> 29:41.400
and leave your master alone
with the inspector.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.840
Go buy some cigarettes or something
and flip the sign over, OK?

29:44.920 --> 29:48.080
-Will do.
-Good. Well then.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.040
So, when are you going back home?

29:51.720 --> 29:52.560
Soon.

29:53.880 --> 29:57.440
I'm hoping you have
that prescription for me.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.600
Thank you. Yeah, yeah,
you're lucky, you still have hope.

30:07.680 --> 30:13.120
I'll probably be amongst those frigid
Berlin broads until the end of my life.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.640
What have I done to deserve this?

30:16.520 --> 30:18.800
Just because I married a girl
from Charlottenburg.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.760
How could I be so stupid?

30:21.000 --> 30:24.840
They pretend to be swinging,
but compared to a proper Cologne bird

30:24.920 --> 30:30.000
you can forget them all.
Here. Ten milligrams max.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.680
Orally. That's two per day.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.520
No more. Or you'll get addicted.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.440
I just want some rest.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.600
Rest, at your age?
You should be ashamed.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.600
-Have a nice evening.
-Yes, you too.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.440
What the heck is this?

31:32.280 --> 31:36.720
Now look here, old chap. Those broads.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
Look around.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.640
They're everywhere.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.120
Broads over broads.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.520
-You don't know where to look.
-I do.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.000
That one?

31:51.440 --> 31:52.840
Is that your bird?

31:53.200 --> 31:55.840
Well, I wouldn't say that, but...

31:57.160 --> 31:59.160
But she doesn't know it yet, right?

32:06.560 --> 32:07.440
Hold this.

32:09.000 --> 32:09.840
Hey.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.400
A little soda?

32:17.640 --> 32:20.400
-Thanks.
-My friend sends me.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.840
-Oh yeah, I know him.
-He feels unable to.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.520
But you don't?

32:29.360 --> 32:32.320
-Does he dance?
-Why, of course. Hold these.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.680
Hey, what else can I do for you?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.480
<i>...please welcome Le Grand Nikoros.</i>

32:38.560 --> 32:40.640
Bye, you were wonderful. Come on.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.960
-I have to see you again.
-Definitely.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.320
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

33:17.720 --> 33:19.320

35:03.080 --> 35:06.240

35:32.480 --> 35:34.960
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

35:35.040 --> 35:38.640
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

35:38.720 --> 35:43.320
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>

35:44.000 --> 35:45.840
-Do you know this one too?
-Sure thing.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.840
<i>mesdames et messieurs...</i>

37:50.280 --> 37:51.720
<i>Ladies' choice!</i>

37:53.200 --> 37:54.720
What's up? You seem so tense.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.000
Good work, mate.
No difference to the original.

38:09.520 --> 38:14.320
Wagon number AB three-two-two-one.
And the signature.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.760
-That's right.
-Thanks.

38:21.480 --> 38:24.120
PRINTER'S

41:43.520 --> 41:45.920
PRINTER'S

42:29.000 --> 42:30.640
You were wonderful, <i>ma chère.</i>

42:42.920 --> 42:43.920
Wegener.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.680
You were wonderful.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.040
Where is Kardakov, that scoundrel?

42:58.680 --> 43:00.040
I haven't seen him.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.440
Look at this. Is this something?

43:09.480 --> 43:12.200
We'll take it, for the boss.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.920
Come on, let's go.

43:14.680 --> 43:15.880
Parasites!

43:25.880 --> 43:26.760
Back to the embassy.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.280
We have to go!

44:39.000 --> 44:41.280
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>
