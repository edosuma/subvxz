WEBVTT

00:00.549 --> 00:01.750
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.750 --> 00:03.507
So, we've swept the entire school.

00:03.508 --> 00:05.415
No sign of the Stratos kid anywhere.

00:05.462 --> 00:08.840
I burnt down the warehouse, so
they're gonna send me to jail anyway.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.966
You just have to put the gun down.

00:11.086 --> 00:14.058
I want to get bars on the windows,
whatever it takes to make us safe.

00:14.072 --> 00:15.936
Today's been kind of intense, you know.

00:15.953 --> 00:19.434
I don't want you to think that we're
like starting up something again.

00:19.434 --> 00:21.155
Maybe there's something
going on with Jude and Taylor?

00:21.162 --> 00:23.230
He's just doing this
'cause he wants attention.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.945
- _
- He's not straight.

00:24.965 --> 00:26.233
Why you being such a douche?

00:26.238 --> 00:27.731
- Moms know.
- How?

00:27.731 --> 00:29.024
I told them.

00:29.024 --> 00:30.554
Callie, they're not gonna unadopt you.

00:30.674 --> 00:32.708
You had sex with you foster sister?

00:32.723 --> 00:34.483
- But I'm not coming home.
- What are you gonna do, B?

00:34.500 --> 00:36.984
I'm gonna live here, with Cortney.

00:36.990 --> 00:39.038
If we had told you,
what would you have done?

00:43.981 --> 00:46.701
Callie, your... Lena and I have

00:46.884 --> 00:48.583
talked a lot about everything.

00:50.923 --> 00:53.076
And, uh, this is a
really hard thing to say.

00:53.115 --> 00:54.825
We've made a decision.

00:55.399 --> 00:57.065
What happened between you and Brandon,

00:57.078 --> 00:58.974
it was an incredibly selfish thing to do.

00:59.002 --> 01:02.753
- But I... we...
- And the lying...

01:03.193 --> 01:05.304
I mean, how are we supposed
to get past all of that?

01:07.562 --> 01:09.912
- I'm really sorry, and...
- Honey.

01:09.914 --> 01:12.627
- I know what we did was wrong...
- The point is,

01:12.627 --> 01:14.235
you betrayed our trust,

01:14.355 --> 01:16.421
and that's not something
that can be repaired.

01:17.688 --> 01:18.717
So...

01:22.408 --> 01:24.815
We've decided to reverse your adoption.

01:28.018 --> 01:31.454
We, uh... we asked your social
worker to come and get you.

01:36.644 --> 01:39.239
She's right here. Come on in.

01:45.873 --> 01:46.946
Mom?

01:48.613 --> 01:49.969
Hello, Callie.

02:53.603 --> 02:55.436
Let's get going. Get
your stuff. We gotta go.

02:55.556 --> 02:58.482
- You want some fruit, Mariana?
- No, I'll get some at lunch.

02:58.884 --> 03:00.625
Um, Callie, we would

03:01.010 --> 03:03.505
like it if you'd stay
for a second, please.

03:04.694 --> 03:07.406
Listen, uh, you know,
if there are any rumors

03:07.433 --> 03:10.394
or gossip at school,
just to ignore it, right?

03:10.722 --> 03:12.631
The best way to handle stuff like this

03:12.647 --> 03:14.390
is just to let it go,
you know, rise above.

03:14.451 --> 03:15.818
Try to respond to that kind of thing

03:15.840 --> 03:18.535
and often it'll just add fuel to the fire.

03:18.757 --> 03:19.985
Yeah, okay.

03:21.677 --> 03:23.426
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

03:29.286 --> 03:30.725
- How about you?
- Hmm?

03:30.730 --> 03:32.174
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.636
Okay, I will be there
all day if you need me.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.556
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay?

03:37.082 --> 03:39.455
Um... did you, uh...

03:39.898 --> 03:41.597
Were you able to get
any of those quotes back

03:41.619 --> 03:43.118
from the alarm companies?

03:43.816 --> 03:45.846
I'm still waiting to hear.

03:45.966 --> 03:47.650
Okay. Just let me know, okay?

03:47.899 --> 03:48.922
I've got to get going.

03:48.934 --> 03:50.267
- Love you.
- Okay.

03:53.061 --> 03:55.330
Can you just get it up and do it?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.299
Like that? Can you do that?

03:59.193 --> 04:00.513
Watch it. Watch it.

04:00.547 --> 04:02.527
Oh, it was a close one.

04:06.506 --> 04:09.482
Sorry, this... I... I started this.

04:09.602 --> 04:11.042
What's up?

04:11.568 --> 04:14.141
Uh, Eddie can't take Mason this afternoon,

04:14.152 --> 04:16.741
so I have to call in sick, again.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.315
I can watch him.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.923
Wait. Don't you have to
practice after school?

04:23.923 --> 04:26.137
Yeah, no. But I got my keyboard there.

04:26.164 --> 04:27.481
I can just practice after I put him down.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.589
Really? Are you sure?

04:31.067 --> 04:31.869
Yeah.

04:31.908 --> 04:34.282
Hey, Mommy, you eat it!

04:35.887 --> 04:38.399
Thank you.

04:40.618 --> 04:41.973
Look!

04:42.399 --> 04:43.650
Okay.

04:46.399 --> 04:48.646
I'll, uh... I'll be back home by...

04:48.939 --> 04:52.491
uh, back here by 5:00.

04:52.502 --> 04:54.556
It's cool. I'll just
get the rest of these.

04:55.313 --> 04:57.501
I'm sorry about the mess.

04:57.501 --> 04:59.536
- Bye, Mason.
- Bye.

05:23.498 --> 05:25.795
_

05:32.987 --> 05:34.287
It's like juvie.

05:34.342 --> 05:37.314
From now on, make sure you
all give yourselves extra time

05:37.332 --> 05:38.763
to get through security.

05:38.824 --> 05:41.059
We don't want you to be
late for first period.

05:45.901 --> 05:46.964
Don't worry.

05:47.191 --> 05:48.447
I got your back.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.985
Hey. So... I'm sorry.

05:54.046 --> 05:55.894
I shouldn't have said that
thing during the lockdown.

05:55.905 --> 05:57.333
I was just freaked out.

05:57.499 --> 05:58.489
It's okay.

05:58.561 --> 06:01.806
I guess, I just didn't want to see
Taylor get hurt like I did, so, I...

06:02.262 --> 06:03.989
Anyway, I'm sorry.

06:04.047 --> 06:05.047
Thanks.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.056
Well, that was cool.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.157
Do you want to go to
church with me after school?

06:18.084 --> 06:19.782
Okay, come on up.

06:27.173 --> 06:29.408
Nice, Mom. You couldn't have
just told me you took the car?

06:29.441 --> 06:31.058
You didn't tell me you
were leaving the house,

06:31.074 --> 06:33.277
without my permission, taking a
car that doesn't belong to you.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.346
Well, now I'm late! And how
am I supposed to get around?

06:35.540 --> 06:37.809
You're an adult. Figure it out.

06:44.591 --> 06:46.319
So what's the end game here?

06:46.439 --> 06:48.174
Are you trying to get
Brandon to come back home,

06:48.178 --> 06:50.331
or are you trying to
push him further away?

06:56.978 --> 06:58.404
Why are you doing this?

06:59.105 --> 07:01.470
- Doing what?
- Moving out, fighting with Mom.

07:01.483 --> 07:03.606
Why do you think, Callie?

07:05.017 --> 07:06.688
Just come home.

07:06.721 --> 07:09.515
Why? So Mom can berate me
again, treat me like a bad kid?

07:09.515 --> 07:11.667
No! No, so we can deal with it.

07:11.868 --> 07:12.979
Seriously?

07:13.223 --> 07:16.288
You're one to talk. You're
like the queen of running away.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.315
Well, I'm not running away, am I?

07:19.382 --> 07:21.207
Callie, come on.

07:21.746 --> 07:24.842
It's... it's... better this way. Okay?

07:24.892 --> 07:28.218
Moms won't say it, but it's
just easier on everyone.

07:28.267 --> 07:30.398
And how are we supposed to live
under the same roof, anyway?

07:30.398 --> 07:32.501
We lived under the same roof
for a long time, Brandon.

07:32.548 --> 07:34.299
That was different.
We didn't have everyone

07:34.310 --> 07:36.844
staring at us and watching our every move.

07:37.962 --> 07:38.936
Whatever.

07:39.246 --> 07:40.712
Do what you want, Brandon.

07:40.723 --> 07:42.641
I just hope you know how
much you're hurting Moms.

07:42.941 --> 07:44.983
No. I'm not the one who told them.

07:49.448 --> 07:51.472
So do you only bang
your brother, or, like,

07:51.506 --> 07:52.728
do I have a shot?

07:54.350 --> 07:57.050
Oh!

08:01.421 --> 08:03.096
Callie, we understand this is not easy,

08:03.097 --> 08:04.818
but I have no choice here.

08:05.117 --> 08:08.237
We have a zero tolerance policy for
physical violence, you know that.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.435
You're suspended. Go home.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.414
Hey, you know what? While you're there,

08:13.429 --> 08:15.532
why don't you try to use the time
to figure out a new senior project,

08:15.548 --> 08:18.309
since the last two,
you know, blew up. Okay?

08:24.777 --> 08:28.065
You know, I, uh... I probably
would've punched him too.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.838
- Sorry.
- Today of all days, this is the last thing I needed.

08:31.861 --> 08:33.111
Are you at all worried

08:33.322 --> 08:34.395
with her being home alone?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.236
Well, you know, I wouldn't
be if we had an alarm.

08:38.715 --> 08:41.924
For me, the worst part
was when it got quiet.

08:42.379 --> 08:43.264
You know?

08:43.740 --> 08:45.494
I was, like, so scared.

08:46.103 --> 08:48.902
That's understandable. I
would've been scared too.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.275
- Anyone else want to talk?
- Is it true?

08:51.607 --> 08:53.516
Nick showed up at your house with a gun?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.745
Oh, um...

08:56.631 --> 08:59.546
- yeah.
- 'Cause you were cheating on him.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.335
Well, no. He...

09:02.455 --> 09:04.050
he was gonna hurt himself.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.417
I... you know, I had
to talk him out of it.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.642
Um, you're the reason he flipped out,

09:07.675 --> 09:09.849
so don't go acting like
you're some kind of hero.

09:09.871 --> 09:11.100
Whoa. You weren't even there,

09:11.116 --> 09:12.096
so you don't know what happened.

09:12.112 --> 09:13.757
Okay? So why don't you shut the hell up.

09:13.784 --> 09:16.080
You can't just sit there and
point fingers at my sister

09:16.096 --> 09:18.000
- for something she didn't do.
- This is not productive. Okay?

09:18.033 --> 09:19.827
Let's all calm down.

09:20.004 --> 09:22.228
We're not here to assign blame.

09:32.419 --> 09:34.074
That was really cool of you,

09:34.090 --> 09:36.021
standing up for your sister like that.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.309
So what are you doing after school?

09:43.319 --> 09:46.114
Whoa. I'm... I'm confused.

09:46.163 --> 09:47.906
When I said I didn't want to date,

09:48.089 --> 09:50.025
I didn't mean that I
didn't want to be friends.

09:50.026 --> 09:53.460
Well, I don't usually
make out with my friends.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.509
How about friends with benefits?

09:55.758 --> 09:57.412
Would you be interested in that?

09:57.532 --> 09:59.658
Let me ask my friend?

10:00.306 --> 10:01.247
Yeah.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.687
Yeah, we're fine with that.

10:12.189 --> 10:14.834
_

10:31.280 --> 10:34.367
_

10:37.372 --> 10:39.120
- Hey.
- Don't.

10:39.646 --> 10:42.396
- What's up?
- Just... don't.

10:42.435 --> 10:43.553
Um...

10:44.156 --> 10:45.635
I'll talk to you later.

11:06.481 --> 11:08.790
- Oh, sorry.
- No, worries.

11:09.913 --> 11:12.541
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

11:15.319 --> 11:16.785
Law school?

11:17.250 --> 11:19.298
Yeah. Why do you sound so surprised?

11:19.418 --> 11:21.107
Oh, nothing. I just, um...

11:21.372 --> 11:23.813
you seem kind of young
to be in law school.

11:23.846 --> 11:25.882
I am. I'm only 19.

11:26.002 --> 11:28.421
It's a five-year law program.

11:28.541 --> 11:31.325
You get your bachelor's
and your JD all at once.

11:31.397 --> 11:32.686
Cool.

11:33.074 --> 11:35.094
What about you? You in school?

11:36.310 --> 11:37.605
Yeah, um...

11:37.882 --> 11:41.478
- I... go to NYU. I'm studying photography.
- Oh, yeah?

11:41.598 --> 11:42.878
What are you doing here?

11:42.889 --> 11:44.782
I'm just in town, visiting some friends.

11:44.798 --> 11:46.193
Nice.

11:47.394 --> 11:49.712
I'm Aaron... by the way.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.113
Cameron.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.967
Nice to meet you, Cameron.

11:56.905 --> 11:59.146
I think we need to make
this fencing permanent,

11:59.190 --> 12:01.281
and I think we're gonna need
to add another metal detector,

12:01.298 --> 12:03.301
or getting on and off
campus is gonna take forever.

12:03.301 --> 12:06.217
- Whoa. How are we supposed to pay for that?
- We've got the Kilfer grant.

12:06.223 --> 12:09.487
That's supposed to be
for music, art, science...

12:09.515 --> 12:11.363
programs you've been
really passionate about.

12:11.402 --> 12:13.880
I'm actually more passionate
about keeping kids safe.

12:13.914 --> 12:16.188
And for the record, I've already
had multiple calls from families

12:16.193 --> 12:17.925
- who want to pull their kids out of school.
- A few.

12:17.925 --> 12:19.773
Sure, that's to be expected,

12:19.839 --> 12:22.609
but is how we want to spend
what little money we have?

12:22.634 --> 12:23.801
Excuse me.

12:23.995 --> 12:26.225
Hey! Going somewhere?

12:26.463 --> 12:27.672
Don't worry.

12:27.711 --> 12:30.378
I'm just stepping out for
some air. It's my free period.

12:30.632 --> 12:31.728
Stay there.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.663
Brandon, I'm sorry that Mom took the car

12:39.696 --> 12:41.046
without talking to you about it first,

12:41.084 --> 12:43.159
but, you know, it does
belong to the family.

12:43.159 --> 12:45.931
Yeah. I know, I know. I was
gonna bring it back. You know,

12:46.318 --> 12:48.160
she could've just asked me.

12:50.335 --> 12:53.693
- So how are things, uh, at Court's?
- Good.

12:54.487 --> 12:55.873
Yeah, it's fine. It's okay.

12:55.906 --> 12:57.842
You're eating enough? You're
getting your homework done?

12:57.870 --> 12:59.215
You're practicing for Juiliard?

12:59.701 --> 13:01.245
Uh, well...

13:01.594 --> 13:03.615
yeah, but... um...

13:03.735 --> 13:05.815
Dad had to get rid of
the piano at his place

13:05.816 --> 13:09.728
'cause I wasn't using it, and the
keyboards aren't exactly the same, so...

13:10.464 --> 13:12.987
I've been playing the
piano here at school.

13:13.756 --> 13:16.423
Brandon, you know you can
always play the piano at home.

13:17.718 --> 13:19.743
You think Mom will be okay with that?

13:20.464 --> 13:21.966
She will be.

13:28.286 --> 13:29.985
So why law school?

13:30.307 --> 13:32.071
Um, well...

13:32.191 --> 13:34.427
I don't really think I wanna practice,

13:34.547 --> 13:36.103
but I wanna work at a non-profit...

13:36.223 --> 13:38.826
you know, social justice,
that kind of thing...

13:38.848 --> 13:41.299
and a law degree is super helpful.

13:41.327 --> 13:44.486
- That's cool.
- Yeah. I've been interning

13:44.502 --> 13:46.533
at the Juvenile Justice
Project. Have you heard of it?

13:46.577 --> 13:48.043
Oh, thanks.

13:48.447 --> 13:49.288
Uh...

13:49.311 --> 13:52.597
they help minors who can't
afford proper legal representation

13:52.620 --> 13:54.351
or who were given unfair trials.

13:54.351 --> 13:56.592
- It's pretty incredible.
- Wow.

13:57.162 --> 13:58.950
What about you? I mean, I know you said

13:58.967 --> 14:01.030
you're studying photography,
but is that what you...

14:01.069 --> 14:03.161
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's cool.

14:03.366 --> 14:04.589
Very brave.

14:04.755 --> 14:07.831
I'm not sure I could pursue
a career that was that risky.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.399
Well, it was great
talking to you, Cameron.

14:11.449 --> 14:12.982
Yeah, you too.

14:26.410 --> 14:28.341
Do you have an extra helmet?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.334
Where are you taking me?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.817
You'll see.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.577
Wait. This is your church?

15:04.577 --> 15:07.305
Uh, no. This is youth group.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.503
We just, like, talk and hang out,

15:10.713 --> 15:12.534
and there's usually
some songs or something.

15:12.949 --> 15:14.094
It's really chill.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.870
Hey, Taylor. What's up?

15:16.080 --> 15:17.209
Hi. I'm Noah.

15:17.226 --> 15:19.007
Sorry. This is Jude.

15:19.368 --> 15:21.036
Noah's the pastor's son.

15:21.156 --> 15:23.211
- Oh, your dad's the...
- My mom, actually.

15:23.244 --> 15:24.307
Oh, cool.

15:24.362 --> 15:26.542
- Jude goes to Anchor Beach with me.
- Oh.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.241
Were you guys there for
the whole lockdown thing?

15:28.247 --> 15:29.552
I saw it on the news.

15:29.602 --> 15:31.461
Yeah, it was pretty intense.

15:31.516 --> 15:33.365
Taylor was like a total rock, though.

15:33.485 --> 15:35.379
Okay, everyone, let's do this!

15:35.406 --> 15:38.079
Oh, before I forget,
we still need volunteers

15:38.118 --> 15:40.060
to help organize the
supplies for the rummage sale

15:40.066 --> 15:41.775
tomorrow after school. Who's in?

15:41.825 --> 15:44.442
- I'm in
- Sweet. Thank you.

15:45.338 --> 15:47.541
Also, I'm seeing a new face.

15:47.574 --> 15:48.919
Somebody want to make an introduction?

15:48.946 --> 15:53.783
Um, this is Jude. He's
my friend from school.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.851
Just a friend?

15:55.851 --> 15:57.240
Well, welcome, Jude.

15:57.555 --> 16:00.388
So, Jude, what we do at these
meetings is, we have a theme,

16:00.682 --> 16:02.718
and today's theme is trust.

16:02.774 --> 16:04.268
We start off with a song,

16:04.273 --> 16:05.695
we read a little from the Bible,

16:05.717 --> 16:07.765
and then we just talk about it. Cool?

16:08.047 --> 16:09.862
Uh, yeah.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.353
All right. Well, let's get started.

16:11.356 --> 16:13.110
- Shawn, you want to sing us in?
- Sure.

16:16.856 --> 16:19.568
♪ Don't forget about love ♪

16:19.607 --> 16:21.233
♪ Around us ♪

16:21.255 --> 16:24.010

16:43.862 --> 16:45.350
I, uh... I, um...

16:45.621 --> 16:47.535
I don't have a condom.

16:47.563 --> 16:48.857
Oh.

16:48.896 --> 16:51.452
Well, just so you know,
I'm on the, uh, pill.

16:51.572 --> 16:53.200
Mm. Yeah?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.594
Yeah, so...

16:54.628 --> 16:56.719
So, I guess we don't need a condom.

17:00.027 --> 17:02.877
You were with Haley, right?

17:03.237 --> 17:04.526
Yeah.

17:05.433 --> 17:06.894
Anyone else?

17:07.104 --> 17:08.079
Um...

17:08.199 --> 17:10.165
Yeah, some others.

17:10.546 --> 17:11.736
What about you?

17:11.945 --> 17:14.336
Well, Bobby...

17:14.628 --> 17:16.278
Yeah, and?

17:17.252 --> 17:18.829
Some others.

17:21.595 --> 17:25.900
Well, I guess, we probably
should get a condom, then.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.530
Actually, that's not what I was thinking.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.506
In the Psalm of David,

17:50.517 --> 17:53.748
he tells us that his trust
in God is why he prevailed

17:53.770 --> 17:56.161
when he was pursued by
Saul and all of his armies.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.900
So what do you think your
trust in God does for you?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.800
Well, for me, um,

18:03.387 --> 18:05.362
most of you guys know I
got dumped this summer,

18:05.379 --> 18:06.884
and it hit me hard.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.384
But what I've realized is that

18:10.042 --> 18:11.581
there's nothing wrong with me,

18:12.516 --> 18:14.048
that I didn't do anything...

18:16.648 --> 18:19.166
that I'm not bad, you know?

18:21.319 --> 18:24.141
And that God's gonna send me the
boyfriend I want when the time is right.

18:24.733 --> 18:27.356
Yeah, I have no doubt about that, Noah.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.134
Because trusting God
means trusting yourself.

18:30.421 --> 18:32.269
Trusting that you're loved,

18:32.389 --> 18:34.775
lovable and perfect,

18:34.963 --> 18:36.258
just the way you are.

18:46.711 --> 18:49.539
So, is this the kind
of photography you do?

18:49.572 --> 18:51.027
You take a lot of selfies?

18:51.147 --> 18:52.449
Who's taking selfies?

18:52.743 --> 18:55.720
- I'm shooting you.
- Wait. What?

18:55.962 --> 18:57.694
Yeah, it's like a good trick.

18:57.888 --> 18:59.796
It's kind of the only way to
catch people being themselves.

18:59.835 --> 19:01.539
You know what I mean?

19:02.004 --> 19:04.472
Um, I got the idea from Helen Levitt.

19:04.488 --> 19:06.392
- You ever heard of her?
- No.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.960
She took these really awesome
pictures of street kids,

19:08.993 --> 19:10.930
but they never knew that
she was shooting them.

19:10.985 --> 19:12.424
Huh? How'd she do that?

19:12.473 --> 19:14.748
Well, she had this
attachment on her Leica,

19:14.868 --> 19:17.304
which made it look like she
was pointing her camera one way,

19:17.338 --> 19:19.917
but, actually, she was
taking the photos over here.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.792
It's cool, right? Here look.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.238
Wow.

19:29.184 --> 19:30.601
What?

19:31.061 --> 19:32.876
These are... great.

19:32.926 --> 19:36.395
Uh... I usually hate
having my picture taken.

19:36.893 --> 19:38.702
And, well, I've just... n

19:39.079 --> 19:40.838
ever seen myself like that.

19:40.877 --> 19:42.632
You look really handsome.

19:56.474 --> 19:58.367
All right, so, in keeping with our topic,

19:58.367 --> 20:00.464
I thought we would do
a little trust exercise.

20:00.497 --> 20:01.832
Okay, everyone stand up for me.

20:01.835 --> 20:03.082
I want you to pick a partner,

20:03.104 --> 20:05.566
but don't pick someone
that you already know well.

20:06.258 --> 20:08.697
Hey, why don't you go with Jude?

20:08.902 --> 20:09.677
Sure.

20:09.937 --> 20:11.486
All right, everyone get a partner?

20:11.552 --> 20:12.460
Let's partner up.

20:12.764 --> 20:15.248
Thank you. Okay. Have a
seat on the floor for me.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.328
Everyone have a seat.
Sit face-to-face. Okay?

20:17.367 --> 20:20.017
Legs crossed, knees touching.

20:20.477 --> 20:22.873
Might feel a little
uncomfortable, but that's okay.

20:23.044 --> 20:24.234
Don't worry.

20:24.694 --> 20:26.924
Now I want you to look
into each other's eyes.

20:27.516 --> 20:29.806
And relax your hands over your partner's,

20:29.845 --> 20:31.538
palm-to-palm.

20:33.824 --> 20:36.166
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Mine are sweaty too.

20:36.286 --> 20:37.857
Shh. No talking please.

20:38.872 --> 20:40.812
I want you to begin
to let your guard down.

20:41.917 --> 20:44.558
Trust that the person
across from you, accepts you

20:44.613 --> 20:45.725
just as you are.

20:46.422 --> 20:48.376
Let your partner see the real you.

20:48.590 --> 20:50.224
Let that be okay.

20:50.718 --> 20:52.493
Let that be enough.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.446
Sorry, I...

20:54.638 --> 20:55.951
I gotta go.

20:59.796 --> 21:00.980
Jude!

21:01.798 --> 21:03.281
Why did you bring me here?

21:03.602 --> 21:05.726
- I thought you'd like it.
- Really?

21:05.846 --> 21:08.233
It didn't have anything to do
with the fact that Noah's gay?

21:08.653 --> 21:11.143
Well, I saw you texting
Connor at the lockdown.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.169
So? You don't know me. Okay?

21:13.202 --> 21:15.055
I knew you liked Connor before you did.

21:15.332 --> 21:18.199
I just thought you might like Noah.

21:18.691 --> 21:21.380
Or at least you could make another friend.

21:21.862 --> 21:23.488
I don't need any more friends.

21:36.918 --> 21:38.782
Hey, can you take a right up there?

21:50.148 --> 21:51.680
Will you stop up here?

22:05.148 --> 22:07.279
Cameron, you okay?

22:17.079 --> 22:18.185
What is this?

22:19.158 --> 22:20.984
It's the house I grew up in.

22:21.776 --> 22:24.686
Oh. I didn't realize you were from here.

22:25.173 --> 22:27.137
I guess I just thought
you grew up back East.

22:27.148 --> 22:28.460
No.

22:29.777 --> 22:31.362
How long did you live here?

22:31.929 --> 22:33.323
Until my mom died.

22:34.532 --> 22:35.979
Oh.

22:36.466 --> 22:38.077
I'm sorry.

22:38.293 --> 22:39.918
How old were you?

22:40.038 --> 22:41.231
Ten.

22:41.895 --> 22:43.291
What about your Dad?

22:44.639 --> 22:46.532
He... went to jail.

22:46.878 --> 22:49.049
He was driving the car. He was drunk.

23:02.384 --> 23:03.895
We should go.

23:41.393 --> 23:42.936
That's the piece you won States with.

23:44.867 --> 23:47.302
Do you remember that trip?

23:47.315 --> 23:49.255
When the car broke down

23:49.255 --> 23:50.859
on the five on the way up to Bakersfield.

23:50.871 --> 23:53.078
- And then that guy that picked us up.
- Oh, my gosh!

23:53.111 --> 23:55.936
- He smelled so bad. The smell!
- So bad!

23:56.334 --> 23:57.844
That is the only time you will

23:57.845 --> 24:00.994
ever ride in the back of
a pick-up truck, young man.

24:05.166 --> 24:06.423
Thank you.

24:07.430 --> 24:08.835
For doing that.

24:09.310 --> 24:10.572
And...

24:11.297 --> 24:13.908
for the millions of miles that you drove

24:14.634 --> 24:18.388
to take me to lessons and contests and...

24:19.164 --> 24:20.576
everything else.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.232
I don't say that enough.

24:25.927 --> 24:27.144
And thank you for...

24:27.459 --> 24:29.119
letting me practice here.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.351
Mama didn't tell you.

24:36.471 --> 24:38.172
That's fine. It's fine.

24:38.742 --> 24:40.059
You know, you can come here and practice

24:40.092 --> 24:42.245
any time you want to, you know that, B.

24:43.973 --> 24:45.433
Hmm.

24:45.553 --> 24:47.611
Stay for dinner if you like.

24:53.609 --> 24:56.254
_

24:59.464 --> 25:00.626
I can't.

25:02.955 --> 25:05.035
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

25:21.071 --> 25:22.665
Here is good.

25:28.773 --> 25:31.014
So, how long you in town for?

25:31.134 --> 25:32.874
You want to hang out again?

25:32.934 --> 25:34.301
Um...

25:34.866 --> 25:36.636
I sort of have a boyfriend.

25:39.088 --> 25:42.258
But thank you for the day... um, the ride.

25:42.378 --> 25:44.056
Any time, Cameron.

25:57.779 --> 25:59.638
Nice motorcycle!

26:01.043 --> 26:02.648
Who's the organ donor?

26:06.295 --> 26:08.934
You were riding on a motorcycle
with a complete stranger.

26:08.950 --> 26:11.119
What the hell is wrong with you, Callie?

26:11.130 --> 26:12.519
You're supposed to be
earning back our trust.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.836
You think this how you're
going to accomplish that?

26:13.836 --> 26:16.603
Do you have anything to say, young lady?

26:16.647 --> 26:18.341
You're hitting kids at school.

26:18.390 --> 26:20.093
You're deliberately disobeying us.

26:20.106 --> 26:21.904
What is going on with
you? What are you thinking?

26:21.937 --> 26:23.619
I don't know. What are you thinking?

26:24.509 --> 26:26.823
- Excuse me?
- No. What's going on?

26:26.943 --> 26:29.953
Are you gonna undo my adoption?
'Cause if you are, just do it.

26:30.468 --> 26:31.967
Undo your... I don't...

26:31.984 --> 26:34.446
- what are you talking about?
- I looked into it, you totally can.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.305
Callie, we would never undo your adoption.

26:39.316 --> 26:40.877
Why would you even think
something like that?

26:40.899 --> 26:42.260
We never said anything like that.

26:42.271 --> 26:43.881
'Cause you never said anything at all.

26:44.069 --> 26:45.972
And when I asked you if
you would've gone ahead

26:45.983 --> 26:48.056
and adopted me if you
knew about me and Brandon,

26:48.061 --> 26:50.513
you didn't answer and...

26:51.801 --> 26:54.031
Oh... my love.

26:58.540 --> 27:00.538
Honey, I am so sorry.

27:01.511 --> 27:02.596
I think...

27:03.691 --> 27:05.617
I think we didn't know what to say,

27:05.617 --> 27:07.752
so we didn't say anything.

27:08.062 --> 27:10.458
That must've been really
awful for you. I'm so sorry.

27:10.578 --> 27:12.506
Callie, we're family.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.857
We're a family forever.

27:15.145 --> 27:18.736
Look, I get it. You know,
you've been in and out of

27:18.797 --> 27:23.237
so many homes. And I have no
idea how that must've felt.

27:24.216 --> 27:28.371
But somehow... somehow,
you've gotta trust us,

27:28.399 --> 27:32.615
or trust this, that no
matter how tough things get,

27:32.620 --> 27:34.535
that we're never going anywhere.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.477
Never.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.005
I promise you that.

27:43.918 --> 27:45.712
- Hey, where you been, love?
- Church.

27:48.545 --> 27:51.234
Church? Did you know about this?

27:51.354 --> 27:53.470
He thinks God doesn't want him to be gay.

27:53.763 --> 27:56.120
Okay.

27:56.579 --> 27:57.963
I got this.

28:09.393 --> 28:11.916
It was just a youth
group at Taylor's church.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.039
Okay.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.105
- Was that her idea?
- Don't worry. I'm not going back.

28:17.091 --> 28:18.593
Something happen?

28:18.883 --> 28:20.637
Nope. It's just not for me.

28:21.102 --> 28:23.404
- Yeah? You want to talk about it?
- Nope.

28:25.230 --> 28:26.809
- You sure?
- Yep.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.505
- Dinner is ready soon.
- Okay.

28:46.299 --> 28:47.334
So?

28:48.573 --> 28:50.291
How was the rest of school?

28:56.890 --> 28:59.673
_

29:00.304 --> 29:01.970
Well, that's messed up.

29:02.805 --> 29:04.150
But why do you care?

29:04.553 --> 29:05.682
It's not true.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.890
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.

29:08.266 --> 29:10.131
It's never the boy
that gets called a slut.

29:10.435 --> 29:12.007
Okay, maybe.

29:12.974 --> 29:14.186
But so what?

29:14.463 --> 29:16.681
What, some idiot takes a cheap shot?

29:16.881 --> 29:19.708
Like if I worried about
everything people said about me,

29:19.719 --> 29:21.086
I'd be...

29:22.380 --> 29:23.509
you.

29:23.786 --> 29:25.263
Hey!

29:30.044 --> 29:32.828
Um, did you ever get

29:33.182 --> 29:35.263
tested for... ?

29:35.988 --> 29:37.028
Eww.

29:37.482 --> 29:38.788
- Do you have something?
- What? No.

29:38.849 --> 29:40.625
Emma wants me to.

29:40.954 --> 29:42.495
So are you and Emma back together?

29:42.615 --> 29:46.153
No. No, not really. I mean, we're friends.

29:46.192 --> 29:51.077
- Friends don't ask friends to get tested.
- I mean, we're friends with benefits.

29:51.131 --> 29:53.554
She doesn't really want
anything serious, so...

29:53.674 --> 29:55.369
we're kind of just, you know...

29:56.072 --> 29:58.008
- Having sex?
- Yeah.

29:59.386 --> 30:00.719
I mean, that's cool.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.780
Well, play on, player.

30:35.736 --> 30:38.161
So, Brandon was here when I got home.

30:38.914 --> 30:42.857
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- Fine, fine.

30:42.878 --> 30:44.819
I managed to be quite sweet to him.

30:44.847 --> 30:47.160
- You were? Good for you.
- Yeah.

30:49.119 --> 30:50.282
Just wish he would come home.

30:50.286 --> 30:52.904
I know, honey. He will when he's ready.

30:53.197 --> 30:56.152
He's just being stubborn. I
wonder where he got that from.

30:56.578 --> 30:58.974
I don't know if it's just being stubborn.

30:59.445 --> 31:01.874
He's got a white knight
complex, has to save everyone,

31:01.901 --> 31:03.760
and I know he got that from me, so zip it.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.996
His father too. Poor
kid, never had chance.

31:07.116 --> 31:10.321
Sometimes I think we're just failing
miserably at this whole parenting thing.

31:10.337 --> 31:11.853
No, no, no. We are not. We are not.

31:11.875 --> 31:13.298
We just have to find a balance, you know,

31:13.298 --> 31:15.146
between allowing them to
make their own mistakes

31:15.168 --> 31:17.812
and being there for them when they do.

31:17.878 --> 31:20.556
Just must be a constant source of

31:20.821 --> 31:22.221
annoyance for them.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.124
Remember how we felt about our
parents when we were that age.

31:24.244 --> 31:26.432
Yeah, but my parents were monsters.

31:26.438 --> 31:28.081
We're not like them. We're cool.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.108
Are we? I hope so.

31:34.909 --> 31:36.409
I'm gonna go check on Callie.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.777
- Sweetheart, she's...
- I'm gonna go check on her.

31:49.657 --> 31:50.990
Hey.

31:51.447 --> 31:53.115
I just wanted to say good night.

31:55.786 --> 31:57.059
Um...

31:58.061 --> 32:00.832
My senior project, I think
I know what I want to do.

32:00.865 --> 32:02.044
Oh, really?

32:02.254 --> 32:04.290
Yeah, it's like a photo essay,

32:04.473 --> 32:07.560
with all the houses
that Jude and I were in.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.236
So, I'll take pictures and then,

32:10.239 --> 32:14.300
like, write about my
experiences in each house,

32:14.344 --> 32:16.452
so, what happened to me,
what happened to Jude,

32:16.685 --> 32:20.685
and... how we found our way to our family.

32:22.556 --> 32:24.287
I think that sounds great.

32:30.628 --> 32:33.169
Um, I was thinking about
what you guys said...

32:34.635 --> 32:36.655
and I realized that...

32:39.028 --> 32:41.114
I think I got a lot of walls.

32:44.273 --> 32:47.980
I think I just thought that it
would stop me from getting hurt.

33:18.113 --> 33:21.279
Sorry, I, uh... I just put him down.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.623
You're so bad.

33:23.188 --> 33:25.451
Did you get to practice at all?

33:25.479 --> 33:27.050
Uh, yeah, actually, I did.

33:27.084 --> 33:30.951
I went home to my moms'
house, after school.

33:31.421 --> 33:32.744
Oh.

33:33.175 --> 33:34.635
Good. How'd it go?

33:34.755 --> 33:36.743
Uh, good. Fine.

33:37.833 --> 33:39.919
Not my best, actually, but it just

33:39.942 --> 33:42.017
felt good to be back in it.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.142
So, listen, I...

33:48.562 --> 33:50.222
I...

33:51.384 --> 33:52.950
It's Eddie.

34:00.408 --> 34:02.594
- I wanna see Mason.
- He's asleep.

34:02.810 --> 34:03.954
If you wanted to see him,

34:03.965 --> 34:05.260
you shouldn't have bailed
on taking him tonight.

34:05.271 --> 34:07.059
- I'll take him now.
- No, you won't.

34:08.623 --> 34:10.068
Shouldn't you be at home?

34:10.118 --> 34:12.790
- Don't you have a curfew or something?
- I live here.

34:14.539 --> 34:16.924
Now get out before I call the police.

35:06.906 --> 35:09.235
- Sit with me in assembly?
- Sure.

35:10.625 --> 35:11.842
Hey, look.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.889
It's Mariana Fost-whore.

35:17.817 --> 35:20.274
It's Adams Fost-whore.

35:25.337 --> 35:28.967
My daughter said something
really wise last night.

35:30.267 --> 35:32.707
She said walls don't keep you safe.

35:34.390 --> 35:37.577
She wasn't talking about Anchor
Beach, but it got me thinking.

35:39.153 --> 35:41.018
What kind of school do we want?

35:41.826 --> 35:44.509
Do we want an armored fortress?

35:44.957 --> 35:47.209
A monument to fear?

35:47.868 --> 35:50.535
Or do we want an open, inclusive space

35:50.557 --> 35:52.499
where our kids can come and learn

35:52.521 --> 35:54.281
and explore and create?

35:54.298 --> 35:56.173
Dead kids can't paint.

35:58.276 --> 35:59.543
That's true.

36:00.428 --> 36:01.984
But let's be honest,

36:02.675 --> 36:05.585
no fence is going to keep all dangers out.

36:05.586 --> 36:08.950
Me and my friends, we
don't mind the fences.

36:08.989 --> 36:12.220
'Cause when we come here,
we just want to feel safe.

36:12.685 --> 36:14.300
Really?

36:15.086 --> 36:16.962
You want to feel safe?

36:18.301 --> 36:19.906
Well, I do too.

36:20.487 --> 36:23.469
But I can't when you and your
friends are calling me names,

36:23.502 --> 36:25.488
saying I'm a bitch and a whore.

36:25.510 --> 36:27.530
Saying that it's my fault that
Nick brought a gun to school,

36:27.541 --> 36:30.110
like I drove him to it or something.

36:30.418 --> 36:33.887
These fences might keep us safe
from what goes on on the outside.

36:34.695 --> 36:37.229
But who's going to protect us
from what's going on inside?

36:48.622 --> 36:51.034
The only way we're gonna
keep our kids safe...

36:51.770 --> 36:54.144
is by being aware...

36:54.415 --> 36:56.794
and present, and proactive...

36:57.685 --> 36:59.555
by being better parents,

37:01.680 --> 37:03.340
We tell you kids,

37:04.059 --> 37:05.913
"See something, say something."

37:07.147 --> 37:08.441
And you did.

37:09.742 --> 37:11.097
It worked.

37:11.689 --> 37:12.895
Thank you.

37:13.437 --> 37:15.705
But how is it that school
shootings have become

37:15.706 --> 37:18.704
something to expect and prepare for?

37:19.557 --> 37:22.744
As a country, as a community,

37:23.784 --> 37:26.451
we've accepted this as normal.

37:27.669 --> 37:28.986
Why?

37:30.386 --> 37:32.555
This isn't normal!

37:33.246 --> 37:35.631
This shouldn't be normal.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.537
We're all in this together,

37:39.902 --> 37:41.971
and that's the only way
we're gonna get through it.

38:00.127 --> 38:01.952
Can I ask you something?

38:03.547 --> 38:05.550
Somebody at that church
say something to you

38:05.566 --> 38:07.758
to make you feel badly about yourself?

38:07.878 --> 38:10.850
- They didn't have to.
- Hey, listen to me.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.041
You know that I'm not a church person.

38:13.428 --> 38:15.940
I believe that there is a God.

38:16.249 --> 38:18.197
I'd being willing to
bet a great deal of money

38:18.208 --> 38:20.560
that she thinks you're just as amazing

38:20.571 --> 38:21.905
and wonderful and delicious

38:21.910 --> 38:24.334
and squishy and adorable as I do.

38:24.649 --> 38:26.093
Okay?

38:26.951 --> 38:28.257
I love you, Boo.

38:28.301 --> 38:30.154
Okay. All right. We're at school.

38:30.176 --> 38:31.449
- Sorry.
- Chill.

38:58.658 --> 39:01.032
I didn't even know that
there were this many...

39:01.093 --> 39:03.539
what do they call them? STIs?

39:03.659 --> 39:05.088
I know, right?

39:05.458 --> 39:08.076
- Chlamydia is not a flower.
- Yeah, no kidding.

39:08.196 --> 39:10.449
And look, HPV, HIV,

39:10.471 --> 39:14.306
gonorrhea, super gonorrhea, syphilis,

39:14.426 --> 39:17.360
and what the hell is tricho-moni-asis?

39:17.570 --> 39:19.695
Hell if I know.

39:23.324 --> 39:25.537
But at least we're all good.

39:25.587 --> 39:27.015
Yeah, but what's the point?

39:27.734 --> 39:30.168
I mean, if we're having sex,

39:30.196 --> 39:32.885
and we're having sex with other people...

39:34.761 --> 39:37.627
So, maybe we're exclusive

39:37.860 --> 39:39.575
friends with benefits?

39:39.940 --> 39:42.370
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

39:42.403 --> 39:44.572
But we're not, you know, dating.

39:44.588 --> 39:46.691
No, no. We're just...

39:46.907 --> 39:50.707
friends with benefits who don't
have other friends with benefits.

39:51.045 --> 39:52.760
- Deal.
- Good.

40:09.481 --> 40:11.140
I came to help.

40:11.672 --> 40:12.878
Sweet.

40:14.432 --> 40:16.396
So, clothes go there,

40:16.402 --> 40:19.472
and dishes and kitchen
stuff goes over there.

40:20.258 --> 40:21.404
Sounds good.

40:21.730 --> 40:22.997
Okay.

40:28.962 --> 40:30.821
That was really cool, what you said.

40:31.203 --> 40:33.803
I couldn't believe the
look on Renee's face.

40:34.572 --> 40:38.312
And if any of those girls ever say
anything about Nick to you again,

40:38.478 --> 40:40.671
- you just have to...
- Can we

40:40.791 --> 40:42.855
not talk about it anymore?

40:43.045 --> 40:45.800
I just want to be done with it, you know,

40:45.920 --> 40:47.388
once and for all.

40:48.235 --> 40:51.145
I just want us to start over
and pretend it never happened.

40:51.825 --> 40:53.026
You got it.

40:55.350 --> 40:56.639
Thank you.

40:57.331 --> 41:00.086
Let me just grab my stuff,
and I'll walk you home?

41:11.301 --> 41:12.274
Hello?

41:12.496 --> 41:13.592
Mariana.

41:14.079 --> 41:16.005
It's me, Nick.

41:17.736 --> 41:20.470
- Hey.
- I miss you so much.

41:20.590 --> 41:21.607
When are you, uh...

41:21.646 --> 41:23.223
when are you coming to see me?
