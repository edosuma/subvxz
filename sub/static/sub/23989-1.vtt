01:46.975 --> 01:48.925
- Anna.
- I'm trying. Don't rush me!

01:49.005 --> 01:50.733
- Hurry.
- Five seconds left.

01:50.813 --> 01:54.471
- I know!
- Four. Three.

01:55.351 --> 01:56.579
Two.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.675
One.

02:03.317 --> 02:05.158
Time's up.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.473
He's coming.

02:09.865 --> 02:11.889
It's going to kill us...

02:13.371 --> 02:15.204
...like the others.

02:16.646 --> 02:19.557
No. He can't.

02:20.067 --> 02:23.213
We're safe as long as we stay in the circle.

02:24.255 --> 02:25.769
Where is he?

02:26.259 --> 02:27.591
Do you see him?

02:32.395 --> 02:37.038
I don't want to play this game anymore.
None of us do. This game is over!

02:40.989 --> 02:43.276
Not yet.

02:43.716 --> 02:45.053
I don't want to die.

02:45.133 --> 02:48.075
- Mary. Mary! Get back in the circle, quick!
- It's going to get me.

02:48.155 --> 02:50.376
Mary, get back in the circle!

02:50.456 --> 02:53.172
- No, I can't.
- Mary, get back in the circle!

02:55.144 --> 02:57.457
- Mary! Mary!
- Anna, help me!

02:57.537 --> 02:59.567
- Come on!
- It's going to get me!

03:01.609 --> 03:04.758
Anna, help me! No, not the dark!

03:04.838 --> 03:07.889
No! No! No!

03:09.241 --> 03:11.539
Anna, fix the circle, quick!

03:14.455 --> 03:16.016
There.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.019
Mary?

03:34.224 --> 03:36.056
You can't hurt us.

03:36.436 --> 03:40.043
We're in the circle. The candle is lit.

03:40.523 --> 03:43.043
It's... it's almost 3:33.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.671
We won.

03:44.751 --> 03:46.600
You have to leave.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.619
It's the rules. We followed the rules!

03:49.699 --> 03:51.547
The game is over!

04:11.203 --> 04:14.043
You lose.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.187
Help me. Help me.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.575
Run!

04:35.661 --> 04:37.349
Shh.

04:37.429 --> 04:38.992
Listen.

04:41.034 --> 04:43.013
What is it?

04:43.093 --> 04:44.930
I thought...

04:46.672 --> 04:48.277
...he's coming.

04:48.357 --> 04:51.636
- We have to hide.
- He'll find us.

05:42.744 --> 05:44.725
I'm so scared.

05:44.805 --> 05:46.235
Shh.

05:46.315 --> 05:48.191
Where is he?

05:58.577 --> 06:00.230
Come on!

06:00.310 --> 06:03.753
- Wait! It's against the rules.
- Forget the rules, Anna.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.277
We have to escape. Now's our chance.

06:06.357 --> 06:08.465
He'll kill you, like the others.

06:08.545 --> 06:11.777
Anna, please. It's just a game.

06:11.857 --> 06:14.088
We have to go now!

06:14.468 --> 06:17.600
You can't leave the house! It's a rule!

06:17.680 --> 06:19.699
Anna, come on!

06:19.779 --> 06:22.946
You can't leave the house!
It's against the rules.

06:23.026 --> 06:25.673
We have to go! Anna!

06:28.115 --> 06:30.161
Max! No!

06:32.593 --> 06:36.015
No! Max! No!

06:36.095 --> 06:37.733
No!

07:19.742 --> 07:22.603
- Grandma Anna?
- No.

07:25.665 --> 07:29.762
- Let's get you back to bed.
- No. No.

07:31.504 --> 07:35.318
Thank God you don't sleepwalk.
I'd never find you in this house.

07:44.050 --> 07:46.002
Did I scare you?

07:46.894 --> 07:48.440
No.

07:51.232 --> 07:53.237
What are you doing up so late?

07:53.317 --> 07:55.334
Checking on you, young lady.

07:55.414 --> 07:59.310
Speaking of which, you should be
in bed. Doctor's orders.

07:59.390 --> 08:01.260
I'm not a young lady.

08:04.202 --> 08:07.669
And look, it's only 8:20. It's early.

08:08.149 --> 08:10.095
Okay, come on. Let's get you back in bed.

08:10.175 --> 08:12.047
Don't touch me.

08:12.727 --> 08:15.543
Okay, well, the doctor said
you need to sleep, so...

08:16.323 --> 08:18.370
...come on, can you please go to bed?

08:18.450 --> 08:20.322
What are you gonna do?

08:20.902 --> 08:22.922
Grams, you need to go to bed.

08:24.164 --> 08:27.913
- Come on.
- Don't put your hands on me!

08:31.755 --> 08:34.361
- Come on, grams.
- I'm coming.

08:38.604 --> 08:40.498
I don't want the covers.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.616
It's too hot.

08:44.759 --> 08:46.612
Come on, please.

08:52.043 --> 08:54.338
Make sure you do your rounds.

08:56.347 --> 09:00.004
Doors locked. The windows sealed tight.

09:00.384 --> 09:02.123
And you be mindful of the rose garden.

09:02.203 --> 09:05.609
Since your grandpa passed,
it has never been the same.

09:09.151 --> 09:12.439
Okay, if you need anything, just call.

09:14.981 --> 09:16.887
Thank you for coming, Alex.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.241
I don't think I could do this without you.

09:19.791 --> 09:22.215
Of course you could. You're a tough chick.

09:23.057 --> 09:26.315
- I love you.
- I love you.

09:31.399 --> 09:33.863
Thank you for finding my burettes.

09:33.943 --> 09:35.795
Of course, grams.

09:48.399 --> 09:50.538
<i>Hey, stranger. It's Friday night.</i>

09:50.618 --> 09:53.325
Yeah. Again.

09:53.405 --> 09:56.219
- <i>So, what's up?</i>
- Just killing time. You?

09:56.299 --> 09:57.827
<i>YouTubin'.</i>

09:58.607 --> 09:59.738
As always.

09:59.818 --> 10:04.185
<i>There's this crazy video with this guy
and this cat. I can't stop watching it.</i>

10:04.265 --> 10:06.145
<i>I don't know why he's doing this.</i>

10:06.225 --> 10:08.857
- Aw.
- <i>What?</i>

10:09.437 --> 10:11.516
I just broke one of the wax flowers.

10:11.596 --> 10:14.445
<i>I don't know what that means.</i>

10:14.525 --> 10:18.156
<i>So you want some company tonight?
Like old times.</i>

10:18.236 --> 10:20.550
Yeah, come over around 10:00?

10:20.630 --> 10:22.188
<i>Plan.</i>

10:23.826 --> 10:26.641
- What do you want to do?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

10:26.721 --> 10:28.659
Want to watch a movie or something?

10:28.739 --> 10:30.941
<i>Your grandma finally get a TV?</i>

10:31.883 --> 10:34.500
Nope. I keep forgetting that.

10:35.180 --> 10:38.361
<i>By the way, it's so awesome
that you're back in town.</i>

10:38.441 --> 10:42.136
<i>Sorry about your grandma though.
She getting any better?</i>

10:42.958 --> 10:45.785
No. Just older.

10:47.365 --> 10:49.772
But everything happens for a reason, right?

10:50.452 --> 10:53.976
<i>Um, not really,
but you can pretend that's true.</i>

10:54.056 --> 10:55.897
<i>I won't stop you.</i>

10:58.126 --> 11:00.984
<i>So, how did you get roped into nurse duty?</i>

11:01.264 --> 11:04.491
<i>I mean, it's cool you're doing it and all
but what about your school?</i>

11:04.571 --> 11:06.405
School can wait.

11:06.985 --> 11:09.405
And to answer your real question...

11:10.747 --> 11:12.819
...I guess I just love her.

11:14.961 --> 11:17.843
Besides, it's not like she has anybody else.

11:18.423 --> 11:21.654
<i>Only you, Alex. Only you.</i>

11:25.596 --> 11:27.993
<i>Hello? What are you doing?</i>

11:28.073 --> 11:29.880
Fixing stuff.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.140
Perfect.

11:35.206 --> 11:37.688
- <i>Nonsense! I have every right!</i>
- Hey, I gotta go.

11:37.768 --> 11:40.923
- <i>Don't you tell me...</i>
- <i>All good. I'll see you later.</i>

11:41.003 --> 11:43.050
<i>Oh, don't forget to leave
the front door open for me.</i>

11:43.130 --> 11:47.637
- Yeah, will do. Bye.
- <i>Red is the color of roses.</i>

11:47.717 --> 11:49.789
<i>Red is the color of...</i>

11:51.431 --> 11:53.575
<i>Red is the color of...</i>

11:54.917 --> 11:56.813
<i>Nail polish.</i>

11:59.155 --> 12:02.210
<i>Red is the color of tomato soup.</i>

12:04.852 --> 12:07.597
<i># Red is the color of roses #</i>

12:07.677 --> 12:11.103
<i># Red is the color of roses ##</i>

12:23.854 --> 12:25.435
Nana?

12:25.515 --> 12:27.380
Everything okay in here?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.441
Alex?

12:36.883 --> 12:38.738
What is it, dear?

12:40.250 --> 12:43.500
It's nothing, I just...
I thought I heard something.

12:45.592 --> 12:47.437
Do you need something?

12:48.579 --> 12:50.401
No, not really.

12:53.693 --> 12:55.541
Miles is coming over tonight.

13:03.010 --> 13:05.665
I always liked that Miles boy.

13:08.758 --> 13:10.997
Don't really care for the rest of them.

13:11.677 --> 13:15.125
The rest of who, nana?
There is no rest of them.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.388
Not likely.

13:23.430 --> 13:26.438
Do you remember my roses?

13:27.718 --> 13:29.599
I do.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.340
I remember the roses.

13:32.882 --> 13:36.339
I remember my roses. My roses.

13:38.663 --> 13:42.556
Oh. I haven't tended to them in years.

13:44.185 --> 13:46.641
Oh, how I loved my flowers.

13:50.383 --> 13:52.012
Sometimes...

13:52.492 --> 13:54.383
...people forget...

13:55.363 --> 13:59.857
...painful memories. They push them
aside for new ones. For better ones.

14:01.869 --> 14:04.682
Okay, well, are you sure
you don't need anything?

14:07.474 --> 14:09.663
I'm fine. Really.

14:09.743 --> 14:11.330
Okay.

14:13.672 --> 14:15.180
Alex?

14:16.808 --> 14:18.621
There is one thing.

14:20.163 --> 14:24.611
Could you fetch me my hand mirror, please?

14:25.193 --> 14:26.769
Sure.

14:27.611 --> 14:31.036
You won't find it there among
my things. It's not there.

14:33.759 --> 14:37.249
- Do you remember where it is?
- I do.

14:37.929 --> 14:39.750
It just came to me.

14:41.252 --> 14:43.302
I can picture it in my mind...

14:43.382 --> 14:46.783
...clear as a bell,
one of my favorite things.

14:50.475 --> 14:52.792
Besides you and your mother, of course.

14:54.472 --> 14:56.285
God rest her soul.

14:59.227 --> 15:01.873
Oh, how I loved...

15:01.953 --> 15:04.839
...my silver vanity mirror.

15:07.210 --> 15:12.461
The last time I recall seeing it,
it was in Grandpa Luster's travel chest.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.215
- Where's that?
- Why, it's in the attic, of course...

15:17.295 --> 15:20.074
...where it's always been.
What is the matter with you?

15:23.376 --> 15:26.217
Okay. I'll try and find it for you.

16:24.345 --> 16:26.163
This place is falling apart.

18:57.881 --> 18:59.910
Please don't be the boogeyman.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.409
Shit!

19:04.989 --> 19:07.725
Okay, now you're scarier than the boogeyman.

19:08.767 --> 19:11.588
Let's just cover you back up.

19:21.130 --> 19:22.688
There you are.

21:18.939 --> 21:20.597
Boo.

21:21.775 --> 21:23.485
Really, Miles?

21:23.565 --> 21:25.366
I made it.

21:25.446 --> 21:28.937
- When did you get so jumpy?
- Jumpy?

21:29.017 --> 21:32.565
- What's all this stuff?
- How did you know I was in the attic?

21:32.645 --> 21:34.766
The light was on, I saw it when I drove up.

21:34.846 --> 21:37.502
Look, I'm here now, so everything is cool.

21:39.544 --> 21:42.150
Guns. And knives.

21:42.230 --> 21:46.654
- You hit the mother load.
- Yeah, well, I was looking for this.

21:47.284 --> 21:48.973
Okay?

21:49.053 --> 21:52.060
Don't ask. Grandma.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.998
Got it.

21:56.861 --> 21:59.523
You know, come to think of it, your grandma
never let us come up here that much...

21:59.603 --> 22:02.246
...when we were little. Did she?

22:02.326 --> 22:05.722
No, not really. It was always off limits.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.865
Can you help me put this stuff away?

22:09.857 --> 22:11.902
You think this thing works?

22:12.894 --> 22:15.709
I don't know. Maybe.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.096
I found these.

22:23.438 --> 22:26.626
No. I know what you're thinking
and the answer is "No."

22:26.706 --> 22:28.753
Absolutely no way.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.558
I'm not stupid.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.452
Hey, we should totally call Kelly.

22:35.532 --> 22:38.038
I know for a fact she's staying home tonight.

22:38.118 --> 22:41.331
Unless, of course, you're not into it.

22:42.473 --> 22:45.530
Maybe. She still practicing goth?

22:45.610 --> 22:47.256
Yeah, sorta.

22:47.736 --> 22:50.076
Well, kinda.

22:50.156 --> 22:52.528
No. No, not really, no.

22:52.608 --> 22:55.219
Okay. Cool.

22:55.661 --> 22:57.559
Hey, what do you think of this?

23:02.101 --> 23:03.959
It's heavy.

23:04.854 --> 23:06.750
And there's definitely stuff in it.

23:07.430 --> 23:09.317
I want to know what's inside.

23:11.159 --> 23:14.175
Well, it looks like somebody
really didn't want it opened.

23:15.155 --> 23:16.900
Like ever.

23:21.062 --> 23:23.927
- Is it bad?
- Is what bad?

23:24.007 --> 23:26.724
- If we open it?
- I don't know.

23:28.986 --> 23:30.617
It could be nothing.

23:30.697 --> 23:32.775
It could be a stash of money...

23:32.857 --> 23:36.527
...or your granny's
favorite childhood toy or...

23:37.007 --> 23:39.681
...it could be something
you're not supposed to see.

23:41.075 --> 23:42.886
So, it's totally up to you.

23:45.128 --> 23:47.829
But I say we do it.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.622
- Open it.
- Why me?

24:01.702 --> 24:04.773
'Cause then I won't be lying
when I say I didn't do it.

24:06.915 --> 24:08.724
Good thinking.

24:35.358 --> 24:36.962
Salt shaker.

24:45.454 --> 24:47.303
A candle.

24:52.345 --> 24:54.214
A pencil.

24:55.256 --> 24:59.495
Okay, we're safe. None of this
changes my opinion of grandma.

25:09.579 --> 25:12.385
- Wait. Is this blood?
- What?

25:16.427 --> 25:18.647
Yeah. It is blood.

25:21.249 --> 25:23.918
"Anna?" That's granny...

25:24.860 --> 25:27.983
- "Max?"
- Who?

25:28.063 --> 25:30.260
My grandma had a brother.

25:30.340 --> 25:33.372
His name was Maximilian, Max for short.

25:34.302 --> 25:37.758
She never talked about him much.
I think he died of polio or something.

25:40.050 --> 25:42.087
Wow. Look who I found.

25:42.829 --> 25:44.935
"Max Luster, age ten.

25:46.115 --> 25:49.768
Fear, scared of spiders."

25:55.407 --> 25:57.811
"Mary Wellington, age nine.

25:58.753 --> 26:01.594
Fear, scared of the dark."

26:03.474 --> 26:06.088
"Josh Christopher, age ten.

26:06.168 --> 26:09.775
Fear, scared of drowning."

26:13.317 --> 26:14.864
Weird.

26:14.944 --> 26:16.855
No!

26:18.197 --> 26:21.284
You opened the game!

26:24.796 --> 26:27.627
- Grams?
- Holy shit.

26:35.756 --> 26:37.787
Thank you so much for coming.

26:38.467 --> 26:40.431
Is she gonna be alright?

26:40.511 --> 26:43.157
Oh, yes, I am confident she'll recover.

26:45.049 --> 26:46.987
Storm is really moving in.

26:47.067 --> 26:49.688
Ah. Good. Thank you for fetching my bag.

26:51.980 --> 26:54.529
- What's that for?
- Um...

26:54.609 --> 26:56.756
...I'm not quite sure actually.

26:56.836 --> 27:00.468
Allen, the stethoscope, if you please.

27:00.548 --> 27:03.489
Yes, of course, Doctor Harding. Here you are.

27:03.569 --> 27:07.825
Thank you. And, uh, if you would be
so good as to prepare an injection?

27:07.905 --> 27:10.509
- Yes.
- 25 CC only.

27:11.751 --> 27:13.380
Injection?

27:13.460 --> 27:16.875
It's a vitamin cocktail really.
Nothing too serious.

27:16.955 --> 27:20.967
Your grandmother has been taking them
for years. It helps with the dementia.

27:21.047 --> 27:23.924
I have never seen her so scared...

27:24.554 --> 27:26.642
...up in the attic... It was...

27:27.984 --> 27:29.955
It was really creepy.

27:32.997 --> 27:36.704
Well, uh, Anna should be just fine.

27:36.784 --> 27:38.646
She has a strong heart.

27:40.988 --> 27:45.963
Alex, um, look,
I know this has been hard on you...

27:46.043 --> 27:48.362
...but you must understand that, uh

27:48.442 --> 27:51.644
...sometimes getting old...

27:52.274 --> 27:54.619
...well, it's just not that much fun.

27:55.961 --> 27:59.886
She's resting now, she should be
right as rain in the morning.

27:59.966 --> 28:01.987
Allen, you finish up here.

28:02.067 --> 28:04.198
Yes, sir. Any other instructions?

28:04.278 --> 28:08.722
No, no, uh... just join us, uh,
downstairs when you're done here.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.439
Miles, Alex?

28:12.519 --> 28:14.317
Can we have a word downstairs?

28:14.397 --> 28:15.975
Sure.

28:35.168 --> 28:37.298
You said she fainted in the attic?

28:37.378 --> 28:38.690
Yeah.

28:38.770 --> 28:40.960
We, uh, carried her back to bed.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.850
The attic?

28:43.492 --> 28:46.157
I still can't believe Anna made it that far.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.690
She hasn't left her room in years.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.249
Perhaps it might be a good idea
if you would lock her door...

28:54.329 --> 28:57.318
...from the inside. Now, I know
that sounds rather harsh...

28:57.398 --> 29:02.475
...but, uh, even wandering around one's
own home can be extremely dangerous.

29:03.455 --> 29:05.307
Especially in this old house.

29:07.199 --> 29:10.290
Ah, so, uh, I took the liberty of...

29:10.370 --> 29:12.826
...writing down my private office number.

29:13.206 --> 29:16.019
Give me a call on Monday, we'll talk.

29:16.099 --> 29:17.589
Will do.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.090
You're a very blessed woman, Ms. Luster.

29:21.572 --> 29:25.260
I hope my little boy treats me the way
your granddaughter treats you.

29:26.402 --> 29:28.271
Sleep well.

29:51.919 --> 29:53.950
Everything alright, Allen?

29:54.030 --> 29:57.402
Yes. She was sleeping
soundly when I left her.

29:57.482 --> 30:00.548
I put a bottle of aspirin
at the end of the table for you...

30:00.628 --> 30:02.914
...in case she wakes up a little sore.

30:02.994 --> 30:05.302
I would also recommend...

30:05.382 --> 30:08.322
...perhaps a nice hot bath
with a little bit of Epsom salt...

30:08.402 --> 30:11.241
Does wonders for soothing
the occasional bump and bruise.

30:11.321 --> 30:12.969
Sound advice, doctor.

30:13.049 --> 30:17.397
And in the meantime, just, uh,
keep an eye out on your grandmother.

30:17.477 --> 30:19.624
She can be pretty stubborn, as you know.

30:19.704 --> 30:23.517
Uh, she's sleeping now, so I'm guessing
you'll have an easy night of it.

30:25.577 --> 30:27.135
Alexandra...

30:28.047 --> 30:30.218
...you're doing a good thing here.

30:30.298 --> 30:32.121
Your mother would be proud.

30:32.901 --> 30:35.632
The world lost a fine soul
the day she passed...

30:35.712 --> 30:37.777
...and for that, I am truly sorry.

30:38.557 --> 30:40.427
Thank you, Doctor Harding.

30:41.769 --> 30:42.997
Means a lot.

30:44.939 --> 30:46.793
Shall we?

30:48.451 --> 30:49.928
Goodnight.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.325
Strong as a horse.

30:56.867 --> 30:58.922
Yes, she is.

30:59.002 --> 31:00.833
You never told me the story behind her.

31:00.913 --> 31:05.505
Oh, not much to tell. Old family, old money.

31:05.585 --> 31:09.092
To be sure, they've had more
than their fair share of sorrow.

31:09.172 --> 31:10.301
How so?

31:10.381 --> 31:13.888
How sorrow can take many shapes and forms.

31:13.968 --> 31:16.074
I never would have guessed.

31:16.154 --> 31:18.217
This family hides it so well.

31:18.847 --> 31:23.014
- Their sadness, that is.
- Hmm. Indeed they do.

31:23.094 --> 31:24.915
Indeed they do.

31:31.234 --> 31:32.796
Wow.

31:34.238 --> 31:36.096
Now what?

31:37.884 --> 31:39.745
I don't know.

31:40.587 --> 31:43.081
Nana said, "You opened the game."

31:44.123 --> 31:45.946
What game?

31:47.454 --> 31:50.107
What'd she mean? Did you see that look on
her face when she saw what we were doing?

31:50.187 --> 31:54.459
Are you kidding? I wish I hadn't.
She was terrified.

31:55.851 --> 31:58.924
Yeah, but of what?

32:37.676 --> 32:39.531
Some candles.

32:42.973 --> 32:44.831
A salt shaker.

32:48.913 --> 32:50.760
A pencil.

32:54.802 --> 32:56.444
A sewing needle.

32:57.846 --> 32:59.873
The rules. This is the game.

33:02.910 --> 33:04.744
The rules.

33:05.128 --> 33:06.944
"The midnight game."

33:08.182 --> 33:10.677
My! I guess that solves that mystery.

33:12.161 --> 33:13.972
Does it?

33:15.256 --> 33:17.085
I mean...

33:17.165 --> 33:19.446
...it doesn't look like a fun game.

33:19.526 --> 33:21.372
Where's the dice?

33:22.455 --> 33:24.739
I don't think it's that kind of game.

33:25.423 --> 33:27.013
Listen to this.

33:27.093 --> 33:31.085
"To call the Midnight Man into your house,
you must follow these steps precisely.

33:32.765 --> 33:35.835
"First, you must write your name
down on a piece of paper.

33:45.679 --> 33:48.689
<i>"Then, using a needle, prick your finger.</i>

33:49.539 --> 33:52.189
<i>"Place a single drop of blood
next to your name.</i>

33:58.073 --> 34:01.140
<i>Light a candle and turn out
all the house lights."</i>

34:21.655 --> 34:25.329
<i>"Attach the paper with your name and blood
mark on it to the front door of your house.</i>

34:25.409 --> 34:28.737
<i>"It must be the front door
and the door must be made of wood.</i>

34:29.755 --> 34:32.245
<i>"Here's where it gets complicated.</i>

34:32.324 --> 34:35.848
<i>"At midnight and not a moment sooner,
knock 22 times on the door.</i>

34:35.928 --> 34:39.185
<i>"You must complete this step
before the final stroke of midnight."</i>

34:53.170 --> 34:55.996
One. Two. Three.

34:56.706 --> 34:59.095
Four. Five.

34:59.175 --> 35:02.666
Six. Seven. Eight.

35:02.746 --> 35:05.060
Nine. Ten.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.422
Eleven. Twelve.

35:07.502 --> 35:09.384
Thirteen. Fourteen.

35:09.464 --> 35:13.034
Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen.

35:13.114 --> 35:16.403
Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty.

35:16.793 --> 35:18.615
Twenty-one.

35:20.482 --> 35:22.298
Twenty-two.

35:34.771 --> 35:37.394
Okay. Now, go outside
and blow out your candle.

35:45.672 --> 35:48.318
Quickly, get back inside.
We have to relight it.

36:00.657 --> 36:02.477
What happens now?

36:02.557 --> 36:04.430
Let me check the rules.

36:12.199 --> 36:14.843
"The Midnight Man is now in your house.

36:23.077 --> 36:26.751
Avoid him at all costs until 3:33."

36:28.740 --> 36:32.081
- That's it? Did we do it right?
- Something's missing.

36:32.161 --> 36:33.524
- What?
- I don't know.

36:33.604 --> 36:36.855
It just says, "You must never fall"
and then the page is torn.

36:38.768 --> 36:40.330
What now?

36:40.410 --> 36:42.279
Let's check the box.

36:54.666 --> 36:58.314
It's got to be there. You know
my grandma, she's practically a hoarder.

36:59.671 --> 37:02.566
I don't know, Alex. I've checked everything.

37:03.350 --> 37:06.213
- This might be a loss.
- Keep looking.

37:08.097 --> 37:12.854
<i>Red is the color of roses.</i>

37:12.934 --> 37:15.458
- <i>Red...</i>
- I should go check on her.

37:15.538 --> 37:19.644
<i>Squeeze the life right out of her.
Squeeze the life...</i>

37:23.028 --> 37:24.554
Creepy.

37:25.338 --> 37:27.820
Do you, um, want me to come with you?

37:28.300 --> 37:32.174
After all, the Midnight Man is out there.

37:32.654 --> 37:34.240
Waiting.

37:36.224 --> 37:38.040
Is he?

37:40.996 --> 37:43.010
I'll be okay.

37:43.090 --> 37:44.906
Be right back.

37:45.660 --> 37:48.721
Oh, Alex, take a candle.

37:49.405 --> 37:53.174
- What for?
- In case we got it right.

37:53.254 --> 37:57.341
The candle part was in the rules. Remember?

37:57.821 --> 37:59.427
Right.

38:01.025 --> 38:02.841
Stay alive.

38:43.943 --> 38:45.945
I think I found something.

38:54.737 --> 38:57.081
I definitely found something.

39:15.792 --> 39:17.343
Nana?

39:27.220 --> 39:28.800
Nana?

39:31.407 --> 39:33.235
Everything okay in there?

39:35.219 --> 39:37.047
I'm coming in.

39:48.431 --> 39:50.347
You in here?

40:13.882 --> 40:15.397
One.

40:16.516 --> 40:17.708
Two.

40:17.789 --> 40:22.637
"You must never fall asleep or stay
in the same place during the game.

40:22.717 --> 40:25.326
If you do, the Midnight Man will take you."

40:25.406 --> 40:26.947
Three.

40:28.340 --> 40:29.401
Four.

40:29.481 --> 40:32.965
"If your candle blows out
you must relight it in 10 seconds..."

40:33.045 --> 40:35.410
- Five...
- "If it doesn't relight...

40:35.490 --> 40:38.759
...surround yourself with a circle
of salt for protection."

40:38.839 --> 40:40.419
Six.

40:41.536 --> 40:42.941
Seven.

40:43.021 --> 40:44.976
"If any of theses rules are broken...

40:45.056 --> 40:48.561
...The Midnight Man will manifest
your worst nightmares."

40:49.901 --> 40:51.768
Oh, Alex!

41:14.952 --> 41:16.690
Grams!

41:19.374 --> 41:22.187
Grams! Grams!

41:24.721 --> 41:26.945
I've been waiting for you.

41:29.075 --> 41:33.096
- No!
- What's your fear?

41:34.480 --> 41:36.067
No!

41:36.147 --> 41:37.663
No!

41:39.325 --> 41:42.146
- No!
- It's blood.

42:32.396 --> 42:34.263
No!

42:41.722 --> 42:43.535
No!

43:02.000 --> 43:05.257
Red is the color of your blood.

43:05.337 --> 43:09.414
It's your blood, Alex! It's your blood!

43:18.243 --> 43:20.055
Bleed!

43:20.135 --> 43:21.840
Bleed!

43:31.664 --> 43:33.895
It's your blood!

43:33.975 --> 43:39.018
Your disgusting, disgusting blood!

43:46.052 --> 43:47.615
Alex.

43:52.986 --> 43:55.218
Alex. Alex!

44:04.489 --> 44:08.719
Alex! Alex! Look at me. Look at me.
It's okay. It's over.

44:08.799 --> 44:12.499
It's okay. It's ov... it's over.
It's over now.

44:12.579 --> 44:16.871
Alex, look at me. Look at me, it's okay.
It's okay. It's all over now.

44:16.951 --> 44:19.567
It's all over. Okay?

44:21.213 --> 44:23.177
What just happened?

44:23.257 --> 44:25.862
- It wasn't real, was it?
- Yes, yes, it is real.

44:25.942 --> 44:29.122
- What are you doing?
- I'm pouring a circle of salt.

44:30.156 --> 44:31.908
Okay. Now...

44:31.988 --> 44:34.276
- ...where's your candle?
- My what?

44:34.356 --> 44:37.166
- Your candle. Where is it?
- I was checking on gram...

44:37.246 --> 44:40.385
No, no, no. Stay in the circle!
Stay in the circle! You have to stay here.

44:40.465 --> 44:41.676
Why? What the hell is going on?

44:41.756 --> 44:45.340
You just have to trust me, please.
You have to trust me.

44:45.420 --> 44:47.628
I found the rest of the rules.

44:49.717 --> 44:52.158
Alex, we should have never played this game.

44:53.329 --> 44:56.236
Now, where is your candle?

44:56.816 --> 44:59.848
I set it on the mantle
to come check on the bathroom.

45:01.228 --> 45:04.927
- No. Turn that back on. What are you doing?
- Trust me. It's safer in the dark.

45:05.007 --> 45:09.827
It's safe. Now, you just need to stay in
the circle. I'm gonna be right back. Okay?

45:18.111 --> 45:21.346
- Where's grams? What happened?
- We have to keep moving.

45:21.426 --> 45:24.980
No, you have tell me what's going on first.
Right here. Right now.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.621
Have you ever heard of Pandora's box?

45:28.405 --> 45:31.119
Yeah, well, we just opened it.

45:31.199 --> 45:32.812
A really bad version of one...

45:32.892 --> 45:35.724
...and I promise you that bad stuff
is gonna happen if we stay here.

45:35.804 --> 45:39.189
- So we have to move.
- What about grams?

45:39.269 --> 45:42.526
She's fine. She's not playing
the game, so she's safe.

45:42.613 --> 45:44.502
I think.

45:45.547 --> 45:48.965
Okay, we have to move. Come on. Let's go.

45:58.719 --> 46:00.275
Alex.

46:00.555 --> 46:02.371
Alex, let's go.

46:34.422 --> 46:38.288
When you went to go check
on your grandma... here, hold this.

46:38.368 --> 46:42.513
After I found the rules,
I tried a little experiment.

46:42.838 --> 46:45.687
I got it, here. Take this. Take this.

46:45.767 --> 46:49.624
Now you have one, that's yours, okay?
Listen, Alex. Alex?

46:49.704 --> 46:52.292
If we get separated for any reason
or if your candle goes out...

46:52.372 --> 46:56.572
...and you can't relight it in ten
seconds, exactly ten seconds...

46:56.652 --> 46:59.341
...you have to stop what you're doing
and you pour a circle of salt around you...

46:59.421 --> 47:02.470
...and you stay in that circle
until you can relight your candle, okay?

47:02.550 --> 47:04.532
Or what?

47:04.612 --> 47:07.068
I think you know the answer to that.

47:07.858 --> 47:09.653
What was your experiment?

47:10.817 --> 47:12.688
I blew out my candle.

47:17.172 --> 47:18.761
One.

47:18.941 --> 47:20.496
Two.

47:20.576 --> 47:22.164
Three.

47:22.344 --> 47:23.846
Four.

47:24.330 --> 47:25.846
Five.

47:26.206 --> 47:27.722
Six.

47:28.017 --> 47:29.688
Seven.

47:29.768 --> 47:31.284
Eight.

47:32.020 --> 47:33.523
Nine.

47:34.507 --> 47:36.023
Ten.

47:46.068 --> 47:47.640
Alex?

47:48.645 --> 47:51.085
<i>You have to die... have to...</i>

47:51.165 --> 47:54.172
<i>You have to die too.</i>

47:58.706 --> 48:02.841
Alex. I swear to God,
if you're trying to scare me...

48:09.525 --> 48:11.335
...it's working.

48:58.382 --> 49:00.672
Hello, Miles.

49:04.596 --> 49:07.684
Show me your fear.

49:12.983 --> 49:15.557
You're afraid of pain.

49:15.807 --> 49:17.680
Perfect.

49:37.780 --> 49:39.469
<i>One.</i>

49:39.549 --> 49:40.862
<i>Two.</i>

49:41.442 --> 49:43.134
<i>Three.</i>

49:43.214 --> 49:47.186
- <i>Four.</i>
- Someone else wants to play.

49:53.495 --> 49:56.185
- Ah!
- <i>Ten.</i>

49:59.469 --> 50:02.303
<i>No! No!</i>

50:08.109 --> 50:11.015
Okay. No. No.

50:11.095 --> 50:13.106
No. No. No.

50:29.981 --> 50:31.860
It's real.

50:34.078 --> 50:35.594
Alex.

50:44.722 --> 50:46.538
Okay, come on.

51:14.910 --> 51:17.925
This is insane. This can't be happening.

51:18.405 --> 51:20.320
I think it is.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.355
I think it's really happening.

51:22.435 --> 51:25.457
So, what, we're just stuck
in this house till 3:33 a.m.?

51:25.537 --> 51:27.055
Yes.

51:27.949 --> 51:29.669
Hey.

51:30.109 --> 51:32.945
I tried the front door, but no answer.

51:35.231 --> 51:37.070
Hey, dork.

51:41.554 --> 51:44.593
Did you, uh, forget to pay the electric bill?

51:45.257 --> 51:47.504
Kelly, what are you doing here?

51:47.984 --> 51:51.934
I, um, I invited her
before we started the game.

51:52.014 --> 51:54.486
I didn't think she would show up
with the snow and all.

51:54.566 --> 51:57.621
Okay, well, this might
not be the best timing.

51:59.205 --> 52:00.727
Okay.

52:01.207 --> 52:03.208
What have you two been doing?

52:42.072 --> 52:43.568
Two hours left.

52:45.384 --> 52:46.731
Wow.

52:47.385 --> 52:50.447
When you guys screw up, you really screw up.

52:51.381 --> 52:53.255
That's not really helping.

52:54.259 --> 52:57.108
I can't believe you guys
called the Midnight Man.

52:57.938 --> 53:02.443
I mean, that's the kind of shit
that you read about in Creepypastas.

53:04.497 --> 53:07.317
You've heard of Creepypastas, right?

53:10.501 --> 53:14.116
It doesn't matter. From what I know...

53:14.196 --> 53:17.028
...and from what you've told me...

53:17.978 --> 53:21.094
...the only way for me to help
is to join the game.

53:21.528 --> 53:23.400
I don't know.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.438
This isn't a joke, Kelly.

53:26.294 --> 53:28.189
I'm not joking.

53:28.269 --> 53:30.723
This thing you saw...

53:31.203 --> 53:33.004
...this Midnight Man...

53:36.259 --> 53:38.522
...it uses your fears against you.

53:40.306 --> 53:43.560
Fears you don't even know
you have until it's too late.

53:45.602 --> 53:48.359
Like subconscious shit.

53:48.839 --> 53:51.445
That's the whole point of the game.

53:52.484 --> 53:54.324
That's its deal.

53:55.004 --> 53:57.242
Well, we know that one already.

54:03.091 --> 54:04.792
It's freezing.

54:10.737 --> 54:13.154
When the Midnight Man is near,
your candle will blow out.

54:13.234 --> 54:16.838
- Near? That wasn't in the rules, was it?
- No, no. I didn't...

54:17.218 --> 54:18.681
One.

54:18.761 --> 54:21.807
Two. Three.

54:22.181 --> 54:23.499
Four.

54:24.183 --> 54:25.699
Five.

54:26.088 --> 54:27.166
Six.

54:30.564 --> 54:33.557
You guys definitely need my help.

54:38.114 --> 54:43.163
<i>Red is the color of roses.</i>

54:43.243 --> 54:49.417
Red is the color of roses.

54:50.367 --> 54:54.979
<i>Red... is the color of blood.</i>

55:01.863 --> 55:03.379
Ow.

55:06.558 --> 55:09.624
Kelly, are you sure? You can still leave.

55:10.104 --> 55:12.585
And leave my best friends alone to die?

55:13.065 --> 55:15.910
Besides, it's just a game.

55:16.644 --> 55:19.451
Wait. No, it's not a game. It's real.

55:20.381 --> 55:21.957
Right.

55:34.044 --> 55:35.560
You're in.

55:37.924 --> 55:40.811
Now, all we have to do
is avoid the Midnight Man.

55:41.994 --> 55:45.268
- This is gonna be fun.
- No, it's not.

55:46.348 --> 55:48.153
Let's keep moving.

56:24.261 --> 56:26.408
Do you still have the mirror?

56:26.488 --> 56:29.327
- Yeah.
- I want to check something out.

57:04.343 --> 57:06.264
This place used to be beautiful...

57:08.998 --> 57:10.816
...until my mom...

57:12.100 --> 57:14.181
Um, what are we looking for?

57:15.270 --> 57:18.602
I don't know. I... I just keep
thinking about how she died.

57:20.651 --> 57:23.722
You guys really need a better plumber.

57:26.456 --> 57:30.421
Wait, did your mom die in this house?

57:31.245 --> 57:33.648
My mom killed herself in this house.

57:44.399 --> 57:46.346
Forgive me.

57:50.190 --> 57:52.880
That was the last time I saw my mother.

57:52.960 --> 57:56.202
Wait a second, you saw all of this?

58:04.356 --> 58:07.144
- I thought your mom died in...
- Everybody did.

58:07.224 --> 58:10.240
That was just a story grams concocted.

58:11.176 --> 58:14.508
She said suicide was
an embarrassing way to die.

58:15.588 --> 58:17.677
And you never said anything.

58:17.757 --> 58:19.630
I was ten.

58:19.710 --> 58:23.101
I didn't understand anything until now.

58:23.581 --> 58:25.677
The game, don't you see?

58:25.757 --> 58:28.378
- We found it in the attic.
- So?

58:28.458 --> 58:32.476
So, what if my mom found it, like we did?
What if she played it and lost?

58:32.556 --> 58:36.001
- It's possible.
- And grandma knew all along.

58:36.985 --> 58:42.235
I just remember grams staring
into that stupid vanity mirror all the time.

58:42.315 --> 58:45.542
I mean, even the night
my mom died, she was so cold.

58:46.821 --> 58:49.116
Not a single tear.

58:50.700 --> 58:53.998
Almost like she was happy.

58:54.628 --> 58:57.908
Wow. I thought my family was messed up.

58:58.790 --> 59:00.985
Hey, can I see the mirror?

59:01.065 --> 59:02.516
Yeah.

59:04.279 --> 59:06.234
I always thought grams was just vain.

59:06.314 --> 59:08.736
Staring at herself
in this thing all the time, but...

59:09.916 --> 59:13.136
...I don't think she was looking at herself.

59:13.956 --> 59:16.384
I think she was looking for something else.

59:17.668 --> 59:20.379
He's right behind us. He's right there.

59:24.709 --> 59:26.247
- There's nothing there.
- No.

59:26.327 --> 59:30.226
- Your mind's just playing games on you.
- No. I saw him, he was right there, smiling.

59:30.306 --> 59:32.353
Ah, this is so bad.

59:32.433 --> 59:35.813
We should just keep moving,
it's getting cold in here.

59:37.813 --> 59:39.701
It's too late.

59:41.895 --> 59:44.288
Oh, shit! I have matches. Come on!

59:46.022 --> 59:47.979
Take my candle.

59:50.708 --> 59:51.884
Miles, come on!

59:57.040 --> 59:59.498
We're running out of time. Come on!

01:00:10.021 --> 01:00:11.634
Okay.

01:00:11.714 --> 01:00:15.288
Okay, let's just go to the attic...

01:00:15.368 --> 01:00:18.812
...pour out a giant circle of salt
and wait this thing out.

01:00:18.892 --> 01:00:21.770
- Will that work?
- We should try.

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:23.806
Yeah.

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:28.760
Shit! Here take, take this! Take this.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.161
One. Two.

01:00:31.241 --> 01:00:34.081
Three. Four.

01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:37.471
- Five. Six.
- Come on, Miles!

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.812
- Seven. Eight.
- The wick is wet, it won't light!

01:00:39.892 --> 01:00:42.625
- Dammit! What do I do?
- This isn't working! Don't panic!

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:45.777
- What does that mean, don't panic?
- Make a circle of protection around you!

01:00:45.857 --> 01:00:48.068
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:00:54.064 --> 01:00:56.684
Okay. Did I make it?

01:00:57.468 --> 01:00:59.286
Am I safe?

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.975
What do we do now?

01:01:02.055 --> 01:01:04.431
There's candles in the dining room.
We'll go get one.

01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:07.714
- Yeah, yeah.
- What? No, somebody stay with me.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:11.536
No, we can't stay in one place.
We have to keep moving.

01:01:11.616 --> 01:01:15.159
No, wait. You guys are just
playing with me, right?

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:19.299
Listen, just stay in the circle, okay?
We're gonna be right back.

01:01:19.379 --> 01:01:22.638
- Okay? We're gonna be right back.
- Okay, but hurry.

01:01:22.718 --> 01:01:24.578
We will.

01:01:25.562 --> 01:01:27.417
I'm serious.

01:01:43.122 --> 01:01:44.985
What is it?

01:01:45.665 --> 01:01:47.922
How could she let this happen?

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:51.032
What's the game still doing in this house?

01:01:54.716 --> 01:01:57.412
I saw something in my grandma's bathroom.

01:01:59.696 --> 01:02:03.083
And it really scared me, and I really
thought that I was gonna die.

01:02:03.743 --> 01:02:07.367
Until that moment,
I didn't really know what that meant.

01:02:08.147 --> 01:02:10.912
To die. But I know now.

01:02:11.592 --> 01:02:14.212
I don't care what happens to me...

01:02:15.396 --> 01:02:17.597
...but I do care what happens to you.

01:02:19.158 --> 01:02:20.698
Alex...

01:02:21.351 --> 01:02:24.573
...you know I have always...

01:02:34.072 --> 01:02:35.192
Okay.

01:02:36.116 --> 01:02:38.038
We have to destroy the game.

01:02:38.118 --> 01:02:41.606
Burn it. Throw it away. I don't care.
But, Miles, we can't let anybody else die.

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:45.438
How could we? I mean... there could
be a thousand different boxes...

01:02:45.518 --> 01:02:49.584
...like your grandmother's in a thousand
different attics all over the place.

01:02:49.964 --> 01:02:52.370
Well, at least we can destroy it in this one.

01:03:04.853 --> 01:03:07.068
Oh, this is bullshit.

01:03:11.652 --> 01:03:13.664
I'm not scared of you.

01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:18.035
You hear me, Midnight Man?

01:03:20.719 --> 01:03:22.537
You're a game.

01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:25.610
An internet urban legend.

01:03:27.843 --> 01:03:29.698
You don't even exist.

01:03:33.482 --> 01:03:35.552
And even if you do exist...

01:03:36.636 --> 01:03:38.214
...I'm protected.

01:03:40.498 --> 01:03:42.338
I'm within the circle.

01:03:43.618 --> 01:03:45.473
That's a rule.

01:03:46.053 --> 01:03:47.863
You can't break that.

01:03:51.284 --> 01:03:53.100
I'm not afraid.

01:03:53.927 --> 01:03:56.197
You should be.

01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:59.217
Alex?

01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:02.053
Miles?

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:03.922
Guys!

01:04:05.556 --> 01:04:08.851
No one is coming for you.

01:04:12.687 --> 01:04:17.551
- Oh, my God.
- No, not God.

01:04:25.935 --> 01:04:27.651
I'm protected.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:30.577
Yes, the salt.

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:45.587
You can't do that, it's cheating!

01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:49.235
Try and stop me.

01:04:58.392 --> 01:05:00.741
Two can play at that game.

01:05:15.225 --> 01:05:16.772
Yes!

01:05:17.052 --> 01:05:19.937
You see that, you fucking freak!

01:05:20.027 --> 01:05:21.985
Clever girl.

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.375
I thought you said
your grandma kept extra candles.

01:05:27.455 --> 01:05:30.117
She does. I saw them, they were right here.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.620
- Unless she took them?
- Your grandma? No, no...

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.467
...she couldn't have taken them because
we'd locked her door, remember?

01:05:36.547 --> 01:05:39.044
We should get back to Kelly
and go to the attic like you said.

01:05:39.124 --> 01:05:42.926
- I'll grab your grandfather's gun.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

01:05:52.972 --> 01:05:55.445
Dr. Harding? What are you doing here?

01:05:55.525 --> 01:05:58.774
I'm waiting for you. We need to talk.

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:02.744
There's some things you need to hear
about your grandmother.

01:06:03.324 --> 01:06:05.140
About me.

01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:07.948
About The Midnight Man.

01:06:08.028 --> 01:06:09.854
You're playing the game, aren't you?

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.764
Well, that is most unfortunate.

01:06:22.984 --> 01:06:25.537
I can wait you out all night.

01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:31.163
You can't touch me.

01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:34.118
You must be punished!

01:06:47.668 --> 01:06:50.957
I see your fear now.

01:06:55.893 --> 01:06:57.377
Kelly.

01:06:58.087 --> 01:07:00.185
Kelly.

01:07:01.957 --> 01:07:04.687
Is that you?

01:07:06.471 --> 01:07:08.518
How do you know my name?

01:07:08.598 --> 01:07:11.019
You killed me.

01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:15.031
How could I forget you?

01:07:18.028 --> 01:07:20.814
You slit my throat.

01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:23.804
- You're lying.
- No!

01:07:28.084 --> 01:07:32.318
Now, it's your turn to feel the blade.

01:08:14.038 --> 01:08:16.358
You're not dead yet.

01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:26.247
I'm not dead.

01:08:28.144 --> 01:08:30.015
I'm not dead.

01:08:40.872 --> 01:08:42.696
Miles!

01:08:44.152 --> 01:08:45.808
Alex!

01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:58.639
- My God! There's three of you playing?
- Our friend, Kelly.

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:01.564
We had to leave her though,
but she's in the circle of protection.

01:09:01.644 --> 01:09:04.133
- Her candle went out.
- That's what we were looking for.

01:09:04.212 --> 01:09:05.834
Another candle.

01:09:05.913 --> 01:09:08.821
I'm afraid, that's not how it works.

01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:11.261
Your friend is in grave danger.

01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:14.037
Wait, how do you know so much about the game?

01:09:19.386 --> 01:09:21.435
I was in the attic...

01:09:22.122 --> 01:09:25.386
...the night that your grandmother
played the game the first time.

01:09:26.317 --> 01:09:27.850
Run!

01:09:46.673 --> 01:09:49.314
I see you.

01:09:55.898 --> 01:09:57.728
She'd invited me over, but...

01:09:58.796 --> 01:10:00.390
...then...

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.316
...she wouldn't let me play.

01:10:02.796 --> 01:10:05.070
Said it was for the big kids only.

01:10:09.854 --> 01:10:12.726
Anna was the only one
that survived that night.

01:10:17.035 --> 01:10:19.472
But she still plays the game...

01:10:21.156 --> 01:10:23.045
...over and over...

01:10:23.425 --> 01:10:25.520
...unable to stop.

01:10:26.104 --> 01:10:28.918
She's trapped somehow...

01:10:28.998 --> 01:10:32.031
...in the Midnight Man's clutches.

01:10:33.711 --> 01:10:36.727
She has been supplying him
with players ever since.

01:10:37.307 --> 01:10:38.892
Why?

01:10:40.426 --> 01:10:43.657
I'm sorry, Alex, I... I honestly don't know.

01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:47.377
But one thing I know for certain...

01:10:47.457 --> 01:10:50.872
...this is no game for kids
or bored teenagers.

01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:57.910
The Midnight Man is utterly ruthless.

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.920
He's some kind of Pagan entity.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.837
It only knows punishment.

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:08.608
- You mean, he's an executioner?
- Yes, and I fear...

01:11:08.688 --> 01:11:10.784
...I fear it's only gonna get worse.

01:11:10.864 --> 01:11:13.559
How could this possibly get worse?

01:11:15.043 --> 01:11:17.786
The Midnight Man doesn't like to lose.

01:11:18.156 --> 01:11:19.993
What does that mean?

01:11:20.073 --> 01:11:23.620
He, uh, tends to bend the rules sometimes.

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.816
You mean he cheats?

01:11:25.896 --> 01:11:30.076
Yes. And he's very, very good at it.

01:11:35.155 --> 01:11:38.916
Did you say your friend
is in another room of the house?

01:11:38.996 --> 01:11:40.140
Yeah.

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:44.683
Good. Good. Perhaps,
she can keep him occupied...

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:47.179
...while... while we go to the attic...

01:11:47.659 --> 01:11:49.724
...and destroy the game.

01:11:50.204 --> 01:11:52.424
We can't just leave her as bait.

01:11:54.008 --> 01:11:57.287
I'm... I'm afraid she's no longer bait.

01:11:57.949 --> 01:11:59.764
She's the appetizer.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.979
Kelly!

01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:35.987
Liar! Liar!

01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:38.613
I know your secret.

01:12:38.693 --> 01:12:41.092
I don't wanna play this game anymore.

01:12:41.772 --> 01:12:45.618
Your tears mean nothing, Kelly.

01:12:46.702 --> 01:12:49.266
Liar, liar.

01:12:49.746 --> 01:12:52.554
Where are you going, Kelly?

01:12:52.934 --> 01:12:54.664
You killed me.

01:12:54.744 --> 01:12:57.550
You can't run, Kelly, remember?

01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:01.095
Are you sad now, Kelly?

01:13:01.455 --> 01:13:04.165
- Stop it.
- You murdered me.

01:13:04.245 --> 01:13:05.586
Stop it!

01:13:05.666 --> 01:13:07.871
Murderer.

01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:10.860
- No!
- Now, it's your turn.

01:13:12.044 --> 01:13:13.978
Leave me alone!

01:13:14.058 --> 01:13:15.877
Shut up!

01:13:19.802 --> 01:13:22.624
I want to show you something.

01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:11.698
Your game is over.

01:14:15.182 --> 01:14:16.735
No.

01:14:30.439 --> 01:14:31.960
No!

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.756
Kelly!

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.018
She's gone.

01:14:42.098 --> 01:14:43.511
- Oh, shi...
- Oh, my God!

01:14:43.591 --> 01:14:45.048
Taken.

01:14:45.128 --> 01:14:48.052
This is what happens when you lose the game.

01:14:48.132 --> 01:14:50.151
We have to get to the attic now.

01:14:51.035 --> 01:14:54.483
That's where you started the game, right?
That's where you found the box?

01:14:54.563 --> 01:14:56.782
- Yeah.
- Alright.

01:14:58.066 --> 01:14:59.837
We're running out of time here.

01:15:02.321 --> 01:15:04.128
Let's end this.

01:15:19.204 --> 01:15:22.048
Quickly now. We must finish this.

01:15:22.228 --> 01:15:23.946
Do what you need to do.

01:15:24.026 --> 01:15:27.153
- What are you doing?
- I just have to know.

01:16:00.688 --> 01:16:01.939
It's true.

01:16:03.523 --> 01:16:06.944
"Annie Luster, age 30.

01:16:07.428 --> 01:16:09.292
Fear of heights."

01:16:12.976 --> 01:16:16.102
Please just d... don't hurt my daughter.

01:16:16.662 --> 01:16:18.830
Do it.

01:16:20.066 --> 01:16:22.931
- I can't.
- Do it.

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:25.612
Take your life.

01:16:25.692 --> 01:16:28.380
Father, forgive me.

01:16:34.914 --> 01:16:36.841
Look at her.

01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:40.215
Look at her!

01:16:41.495 --> 01:16:43.509
My mom didn't kill herself.

01:16:43.989 --> 01:16:46.511
She was murdered by my grandma.

01:16:46.591 --> 01:16:49.284
She tricked her into playing
the game. Like you said...

01:16:49.364 --> 01:16:52.993
...she's been supplying the Midnight Man
with players knowing what could happen.

01:16:53.073 --> 01:16:56.372
And she sent me up here to get
her mirror knowing I would find the box.

01:16:56.452 --> 01:17:00.446
- And she knew I would open it.
- None of that matters now.

01:17:00.526 --> 01:17:04.521
You need to surround yourselves
with the salt.

01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:08.090
Make a... a circle of protection. Fast!

01:17:10.274 --> 01:17:12.918
- Wait, how much time is left?
- Just... just hurry.

01:17:13.335 --> 01:17:16.384
All that matters now
is that you both survive.

01:17:17.264 --> 01:17:19.374
Easier said than done.

01:17:23.754 --> 01:17:25.280
Anna.

01:17:26.214 --> 01:17:28.096
Anna, no more.

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:31.632
Please, just listen to me.

01:17:31.712 --> 01:17:35.536
This must stop now! I beg of you!

01:17:35.616 --> 01:17:37.600
Why did you do it?

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.403
Why did you kill your own daughter?
How could you?

01:17:41.483 --> 01:17:45.129
She was a thief and a liar and a whore!

01:17:45.209 --> 01:17:47.340
She deserved to be punished.

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.125
And I got picked to punish her.

01:17:50.205 --> 01:17:52.286
Don't listen to her, Alex.

01:17:53.016 --> 01:17:55.545
That's not your grandmother anymore.

01:17:57.209 --> 01:17:58.793
What?

01:18:02.527 --> 01:18:04.273
He's here.

01:18:06.127 --> 01:18:09.203
He's using her for a conduit.

01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:11.732
Is... is the circle finished?

01:18:12.632 --> 01:18:14.657
Shit, the candles are out.

01:18:16.557 --> 01:18:18.126
Shi...

01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:21.207
There's one left.

01:18:21.287 --> 01:18:24.827
It's okay 'cause we're in the circle.
We're in the circle. We're in the salt.

01:18:24.907 --> 01:18:27.030
Dr. Harding, get in the circle.

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:30.872
No. It doesn't work for me.
I... I'm not in the game.

01:18:30.952 --> 01:18:32.825
He can't hurt me.

01:18:43.309 --> 01:18:44.895
Tommy?

01:18:53.436 --> 01:18:54.852
Annie.

01:18:58.016 --> 01:18:59.858
My Annie.

01:19:03.986 --> 01:19:05.736
Dr. Harding!

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.754
No!

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.466
Stop!

01:19:29.054 --> 01:19:30.856
Stop it.

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.825
Nana, stop!

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.203
I said stop!

01:19:59.685 --> 01:20:02.308
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:20:02.388 --> 01:20:05.010
I didn't... I didn't wanna hurt you.

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:07.988
I was just a little girl.

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:13.117
Just like you.

01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:18.223
And my mom said that you had to die too.

01:20:18.303 --> 01:20:21.477
My mommy said that you have to die too.

01:20:21.557 --> 01:20:23.705
You have to be dead too.

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.847
You have to be dead too!

01:20:25.927 --> 01:20:29.413
Be dead too! You should be fucking afraid.

01:20:57.384 --> 01:20:59.248
It's over.

01:20:59.928 --> 01:21:01.773
It's over.

01:21:03.157 --> 01:21:04.972
Is it?

01:21:08.278 --> 01:21:11.566
Not yet.

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:35.300
The half hour mark! It's 3:30.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.424
Three more minutes.

01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:39.848
We made it.

01:21:49.227 --> 01:21:51.058
You've lost.

01:21:51.538 --> 01:21:53.427
We won.

01:22:08.414 --> 01:22:11.807
I am so sad!

01:23:20.904 --> 01:23:22.462
One.

01:23:23.046 --> 01:23:24.562
Two.

01:23:25.866 --> 01:23:27.423
Three.

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.494
Four.

01:23:34.834 --> 01:23:36.653
It's 4 a.m.

01:23:37.937 --> 01:23:39.814
It's 4:00.

01:23:40.398 --> 01:23:42.219
We made it.

01:23:42.299 --> 01:23:44.195
It's over.

01:23:49.968 --> 01:23:52.782
You sacrificed yourself for us.

01:24:04.196 --> 01:24:06.494
Let's destroy this game and get out of here.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.471
The Midnight Man doesn't like to lose.

01:24:25.051 --> 01:24:29.497
Sometimes he, uh, tends to bend the rules.

01:24:33.451 --> 01:24:35.558
It's not 3:33 yet.

01:24:47.706 --> 01:24:49.376
Miles, no!

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.717
No!

01:24:53.361 --> 01:24:54.922
No!

01:25:04.908 --> 01:25:07.238
There is no escape!

01:25:22.816 --> 01:25:27.067
Your tears mean nothing to me.

01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:38.875
Your game is over.

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.591
- Dad?
- Yeah.

01:26:41.671 --> 01:26:43.610
You knew the people that lived here?

01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:47.087
- Yes, I did.
- What happened to them?

01:26:47.167 --> 01:26:48.990
Sorrow happened.

01:26:58.245 --> 01:27:01.316
- Can I have this?
- Let me see.

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:06.565
I don't see why not. Looks harmless.

01:27:06.645 --> 01:27:07.958
Cool.

01:27:08.038 --> 01:27:10.492
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

01:27:12.318 --> 01:27:14.073
So what do you think is in there?

01:27:14.153 --> 01:27:16.726
I don't know. I hope it's a game.

01:30:13.707 --> 01:30:17.047
<i>So if you really...</i>

01:30:17.127 --> 01:30:19.007
<i>...go the whole way...</i>

01:30:19.087 --> 01:30:23.371
<i>...and see how you feel
at the prospect of vanishing forever.</i>

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.136
<i>Have all your efforts...</i>

01:30:26.216 --> 01:30:29.351
<i>...and all your achievements
and all your attainments...</i>

01:30:29.431 --> 01:30:32.855
<i>...turning into dust and nothingness.</i>

01:30:33.335 --> 01:30:36.599
<i>What is the feeling? There is no feeling.</i>
