Hello? Hello?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.276
Hello?

02:41.370 --> 02:43.293
Another day.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.921
Another day.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.573
Go away.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.124
Go away.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.428
When I say stop, you have to...
Morning.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.053
Have a nice day.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.899
<i>Good morning, madam.</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:24.727
<i>We at Euphoria Finance want to put
the "you" back into euphoria.</i>

04:24.931 --> 04:26.899
<i>Your lifestyle is our concern.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:28.977
<i>Your dreams are our dreams.</i>

04:29.186 --> 04:32.315
<i>That's why we say,
"Enough is never enough."</i>

04:32.522 --> 04:35.617
<i>Call us today and ask for more.</i>

04:35.817 --> 04:37.945
<i>Good morning, madam.
We at Euphoria...</i>

04:38.862 --> 04:41.490
<i>Everyone's getting rich, except you.</i>

04:41.698 --> 04:45.293
<i>Learn the secrets of their success
tonight at 8 on DuMBC.</i>

04:45.494 --> 04:48.122
<i>Bored with Buddhism,
sick of Scientology?</i>

04:48.330 --> 04:51.379
<i>Then the Church of Batman
the Redeemer may be the answer.</i>

04:51.583 --> 04:54.086
<i>The future has come and gone.</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:55.637
<i>Where were you?</i>

04:55.837 --> 05:00.092
<i>Don't miss out the next time.
Call 897-3434.</i>

05:16.858 --> 05:19.236
<i>Occupy Mall Street now.</i>

05:19.444 --> 05:22.288
<i>Autumn sales have started.
Bargains galore.</i>

05:22.864 --> 05:26.459
<i>Up to 100 percent off selected items.</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:29.459
<i>Autumn sales have started.
Bargains galore.</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:32.337
<i>Up to 100 percent off selected items.</i>

05:32.541 --> 05:35.385
<i>...24 hours a day at BabyC.</i>

05:35.544 --> 05:37.842
<i>We've cut out all the bad news.</i>

05:41.091 --> 05:44.891
<i>We live in
a chaotic, confusing world.</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:49.350
<i>So many choices, so little time.</i>

05:49.558 --> 05:51.526
<i>What do we need?</i>

05:51.726 --> 05:53.399
<i>Who do with love?</i>

05:53.603 --> 05:56.447
<i>What brings us joy?</i>

05:58.900 --> 06:02.825
<i>Mancom, making
sense of the good things in life.</i>

06:05.031 --> 06:08.752
Ahem. I hope you
enjoyed our presentation.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.375
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.174
Now, if you'll please follow me.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.298
Please stay together.
Here's your chance to observe

06:17.502 --> 06:21.632
Mancom's proprietary Q-void
computation system in action.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.263
No photos, please. Thank you.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.016
We call it the power of six.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.188
Six degrees of convergence,

06:29.389 --> 06:33.610
providing stability
for business or personal needs.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.647
As you can see, our company
encourages an atmosphere

06:36.855 --> 06:40.359
of vigorous
but healthy competition.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.526
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.
Corporate Health Maintenance</i>

07:14.726 --> 07:18.697
<i>have approved review of your
disability request for today at 14:40.</i>

07:18.897 --> 07:20.319
<i>Please be prompt.</i>

07:20.523 --> 07:23.367
We're nothing if not prompt.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.090
All right, Quinn.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.720
How's it hanging?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.098
It's Qohen, Mr. Joby.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.806
And as we've told you before,
it isn't hanging well. We're dying.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.314
You should see the medics about that.
Can't afford to lose you.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.692
We have an appointment this afternoon.
Not this afternoon.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.239
You approved it.
Cancel.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.363
You got still the Transfinite Paradox
project due today.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.661
Finished.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.908
Pathologics division's running
the standard redundancies.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.910
You do all that this morning?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.921
As mentioned to you repeatedly,
we detest working here.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.129
Considering our output,
we can't begin to understand

08:20.333 --> 08:24.054
why you insist on our coming here.
That's a Management issue.

08:24.254 --> 08:29.306
It's Qohen. Q. no U, O-H-E-N.
Out of my hands.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.312
Then perhaps we should be talking
to Management.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.482
No, no, no.
Nobody speaks to Management.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.812
You know that. No way, no way.
Look, take my advice.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.568
Knock off the bitching and moaning.
It's not bad.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.575
We could accept
braving this ghastly place

08:45.734 --> 08:47.736
were it not for fear
of missing our call.

08:47.944 --> 08:52.450
Oh, that call, yeah. Could you not let
the machine take it or call forwarding?

08:52.657 --> 08:56.628
I could always bend the rules
on personal calls in your case.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.915
We have to be home to receive it.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.046
Look, I'll see what I can do, all right?

09:05.253 --> 09:06.550
Sorry.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.225
We prefer not to be touched.
All right.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.974
Qohen Leth,
ontological research division,

09:17.432 --> 09:20.311
requesting disability leave.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.605
Or reassignment to work at home.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.814
That's Management's decision,
Mr. Leth.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.993
We only deal with health issues
here.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.912
What seems to be the problem?

09:31.112 --> 09:33.331
- We are dying.
- Who's we?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.167
Us. Ourselves.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.541
- But there's only one of you.
- So it would appear.

09:40.997 --> 09:45.673
This subject has undergone
five physicals the last year.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.971
He's healthy as a horse.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.890
- My hair has fallen out.
- Perfectly normal.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.887
You're the most productive
number cruncher in your unit.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.981
Entity crunchers.

09:58.181 --> 10:03.187
We work with esoteric data
that have a life on their own

10:04.020 --> 10:07.490
and are substantially more complex
than numbers.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.411
In the experience of this board,
dying people are rarely so productive.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.785
Nevertheless, we're dying.
No, we're not.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.036
Yes, we are.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.743
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.294
We're not.
Yes, we are.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.792
Not. Not. Not.
Bus, bus.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.293
May the party-party bug.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.966
I'll do this one.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.387
You're not dying.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.013
Although, in a way,

10:35.218 --> 10:37.846
from the moment of birth,
we all begin to die.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.728
Call it divinely planned
obsolescence.

10:40.932 --> 10:44.732
Soon or late, beggar or king,
death is the end of all things.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.898
Why, life might be seen as a virus

10:48.106 --> 10:50.484
infecting the perfect organism
of death.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.821
That's enough, doctor.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.239
It's true.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.409
Disability request denied.
It's back to work for you.

10:59.284 --> 11:03.460
However, this board recommends
further psychiatric evaluation.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.090
I haven't time for more therapists.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.719
I hope you'll have time for this.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.599
Did you hear about tonight?
Changed.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.848
It's not 8, it's 7:30, right?
Okay.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.269
I'm going as a tiger.

11:21.097 --> 11:25.068
All right, Quinn. I told you,
the medics wouldn't help. Leave it.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.939
It's all right. Joby's on the job.
Problem solved.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.903
You're sending us home?
One thing at a time.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.487
I can get Management to see you.
He's coming to my party tonight.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.077
Party?
I'll just give you the address.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.704
You turn up and I'll do the rest.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.126
We're afraid we can't.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.579
What, staying in
and washing your hair?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.210
We have to stay home,
wait for our call.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.760
Look, do you want my help or not?

11:51.628 --> 11:54.131
We fear parties.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.392
Never quite know where to stand.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.060
You kill me, you lunatic.
You don't know where to stand?

12:04.015 --> 12:05.312
You gotta love it.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.436
I'll see you tonight, Quinn.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.397
It's Qohen.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.425
Hey! Quinn!

12:41.135 --> 12:43.103
That's the wrong way.
This way. This way.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.353
Party. Party. Come in. Come in.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.019
Yeah.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.697
This is the main room,
everything's free in there.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.492
Hello, Barbara.
How you doing, darling? All right?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.536
You... She can't...

12:58.903 --> 13:00.371
You see what this is?

13:00.571 --> 13:02.539
You see this? Know what it is?

13:02.740 --> 13:05.459
That's marble. It's real marble.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.379
This place is covered in it.
It's my uncle's.

13:08.579 --> 13:12.334
It was my uncle's. He lost everything
in the Sit On My Facebook crash.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.590
The removal men
are coming tomorrow

13:14.794 --> 13:16.637
but tonight, it's ours,

13:16.838 --> 13:22.186
so you party. Heh. Whoo!

13:22.427 --> 13:25.727
Is Management here?
MM! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.687
Keep it down.
You don't wanna start a rumour, right?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.814
Where's Management?
Shh.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.691
When he gets here, I'll let you know.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.947
In the meantime, lighten up.
Have some fun for a change.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.780
And mingle, Quinn. Mingle, all right?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.456
It's Qohen.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.329
Yeah, yeah, of course.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.758
Hi.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.930
I love the look.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.010
Final evolution or re-product?

14:03.468 --> 14:06.972
Maximum brain, minimalist body.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.641
Excuse us.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.494
Sit.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.458
Now, what seems to be the problem?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.795
We simply want to go home.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.628
Home?

15:19.419 --> 15:22.844
We can tell that you are a man
who values his solitude,

15:23.047 --> 15:26.221
and we too are better off left alone.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.101
We fail to see the logic
in wasting time commuting

15:30.304 --> 15:33.023
to a cubicle
where we work independently

15:33.224 --> 15:36.603
amid other workers
similarly cubicled.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.237
We could easily double
the output there

15:41.441 --> 15:42.943
at home.

15:44.318 --> 15:48.494
And our chief concern
is that we might miss our call.

15:48.698 --> 15:53.295
You see, we've been waiting
for a call all our life now.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.873
And, well, we've...

15:57.081 --> 16:00.255
The nature or the origin of our call
remains a mystery to us.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.588
We can't help but hope

16:02.795 --> 16:06.971
that it will provide us with a purpose
we've long lived without.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.523
You're quite insane, Mr. Leth.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.156
We're sorry to have disturbed you.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.909
Drink?
No.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.492
Drink?

16:33.242 --> 16:37.088
Oh! Whoa. Quinn,
you chrome dome bastard.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.632
Where are you sneaking off?
Sneaky, sneaky.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.880
Give me that coat.
We've seen him.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.303
Who?
Management.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.174
Would you stop?
Management parties incognito.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.135
No, this isn't what he...
You're blowing his cover.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.017
We really must go home now.

16:53.221 --> 16:57.397
No. Look, I'll sort something out.
I'll get you a proper meeting with him.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.353
There's no way you're going
without something to eat.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.608
It's Qohen.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.362
We've had, apparently, our meeting.
Just one.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.819
Our diet dictates against any foods
with perceptible flavour.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.078
All right, all right, all right.
Eat, eat, eat. That's an order.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.873
Plenty of eats.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.923
Plenty more.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.876
Plenty for everybody.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.842
All right.
Hey. Hold. Hold it. Yeah.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.846
What is the meaning of life,
Mr. Leth?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.566
Ah. So close to its end
and still no answers.

17:42.436 --> 17:46.441
I have a special project for you that
could prove to be mutually beneficial.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.863
There's not a lot of time,
not much time at all.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.648
Whoo!

18:26.772 --> 18:28.945
Okay.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.748
You alive in there?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.296
Whoo. Are you okay?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.001
Yeah?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.512
Yeah.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.763
Excuse us.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.479
Care to join me?
Excuse us?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.651
I won't be long.

19:28.542 --> 19:32.092
So I saved your life.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.889
So what?

19:35.675 --> 19:38.645
Thank you.
You're welcome.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.812
I'm Bainsley.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.141
And you are?

19:43.349 --> 19:46.319
Qohen. Q, no U.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.362
And you work with these people?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.065
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.870
What do you do?
Us? We crunch entities.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.165
You got a mouse in your pocket? Heh.
Excuse us?

19:59.365 --> 20:00.992
But who's "we"?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.952
Us. Ourselves.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.834
Oh, catchy.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.336
Hey, help!

20:09.834 --> 20:11.711
You're staring at me.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.263
You think my dress
is incredibly ugly?

20:18.092 --> 20:20.686
Well, it's my daddy's fault.

20:20.886 --> 20:25.266
He used to buy me these incredibly
ugly clothes to keep the boys away.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.817
It didn't work.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.361
Only made me wanna get naked.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.903
And that's no way
to keep the boys away.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.359
Excuse us.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.535
<i>We really must leave now.</i>

20:36.736 --> 20:38.113
<i>No, wait.</i>

20:38.279 --> 20:39.952
<i>Just wait.</i>

20:40.156 --> 20:41.328
<i>Wait.</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:54.595
Did anybody ever tell you,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

20:54.795 --> 20:58.516
Excuse us? What's all this about?
You're going home.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.610
Zero theorem.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.529
All very hush-hush.

21:12.730 --> 21:16.325
Management's been handpicking talent
since before I was hired.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.199
Nobody lasts.
It's a guaranteed burnout project.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.327
I worked at it for about three weeks
when I was young.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.748
Drove me balmy.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.327
After Zip-T,
I couldn't crunch Coco Pops.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.754
That's why Management
made me a supervisor.

21:28.954 --> 21:33.209
You might've noticed I'm a few raisins
short of a full scoop. Ha-ha.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.928
That's why he chose you,
I think. Ooh.

21:36.253 --> 21:40.224
Nothing left to lose. The Tech boys
should be around at your place now,

21:40.424 --> 21:44.429
changing the locks, setting up the
standard at-home work force security.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.106
I've got my money on you, Quinn.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.651
You'll be proving that theorem
in no time.

21:50.851 --> 21:54.651
What exactly will we be proving?
That Management's getting desperate.

21:58.400 --> 22:03.327
Have you ever wondered where
all the stuff you crunch winds up?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.787
Voilà.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.297
Here. Put this on.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.306
Come.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.894
Neural Net Mancrive.

22:30.099 --> 22:33.103
The centre of Management's
entire operation.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.109
Smart as shit and still learning.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.908
Now, be very, very quiet.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.703
We're hunting entities.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.413
Working hard, Bob, or hardly working?

22:48.576 --> 22:49.828
Today's the same, Bob.

22:50.035 --> 22:54.290
Don't mind me, Bob, I'm just getting
Quinn started on the old Zipster.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.678
That's a waste of time, Bob.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.721
I give him two weeks.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.549
That's Bob, summer intern.

23:03.924 --> 23:07.679
- Why does he call you Bob?
- Oh, Bob calls everybody Bob.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.007
He says it's a waste of brain cells
remembering names.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.275
He's a hardware specialist.
Isn't he rather young for that?

23:13.475 --> 23:16.319
No, that kid could programme
before he could walk.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.875
Right. Now, here's your software.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.545
Management will send you
new data downloads every week.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.124
How long is this project
going to take?

23:36.332 --> 23:39.336
Don't know. It could take forever.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.849
When I was a little tyke, everybody
thought neutrinos had no mass.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.017
Somebody discovered
they do have mass.

23:47.217 --> 23:50.266
Tiny little bit of mass,
but mass is mass, right?

23:50.471 --> 23:52.724
It's got to add up to something.

23:54.099 --> 23:58.070
That stuff used to keep me awake
at night. Not that you should worry.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.319
Everything's under control.
You got everything you wanted.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.785
Ever get a feeling the world's
giggling behind your back?

24:04.985 --> 24:06.487
Everybody in the universe

24:06.695 --> 24:09.164
is in on some cosmic joke.
Everybody but you.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.451
The only reason you're not laughing
is you're the punchline.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.086
You ever get that feeling, Quinn?
It's Qohen.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.254
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.423
Well, it pays the same, Bob.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.592
<i>Pays the same.</i>

24:27.633 --> 24:32.639
<i>Zero currently equals 93.
78926 percent.</i>

24:33.097 --> 24:35.771
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

24:36.558 --> 24:41.735
<i>Your first instalment of processed data
is due for upload in four hours.</i>

24:41.939 --> 24:43.566
<i>Good luck.</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:20.440
Yeah.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.865
Hmm.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.393
Yeah.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.599
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.</i>

25:58.807 --> 26:02.607
<i>Your next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.</i>

26:12.404 --> 26:15.328
<i>Enter number of minutes needed
for target overrun.</i>

26:47.481 --> 26:50.109
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.</i>

26:50.317 --> 26:54.868
<i>Zero currently equals
93. 789 percent.</i>

26:55.072 --> 26:58.622
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

27:06.792 --> 27:08.385
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, Qohen Leth.</i>

27:08.585 --> 27:12.385
<i>Your next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.</i>

27:12.589 --> 27:15.138
<i>If the target timetable is attainable,
press one.</i>

27:15.342 --> 27:17.970
<i>If not, enter what is needed
for target overrun.</i>

27:18.178 --> 27:21.352
<i>Your next instalment of processed data
is...</i>

27:35.320 --> 27:38.073
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

27:39.867 --> 27:42.711
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

27:43.370 --> 27:46.749
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

27:53.589 --> 27:56.012
<i>You seem tense, Qohen.</i>

27:58.760 --> 28:01.809
<i>Let's return to the subject
of your fears.</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:07.271
<i>In past sessions, you have reported
a fear of death, a fear of life,</i>

28:07.477 --> 28:09.650
<i>a fear of open spaces,
closed places,</i>

28:09.855 --> 28:12.199
<i>a fear of people,
a fear of being alone,</i>

28:12.399 --> 28:14.401
<i>a fear of missing certain.</i>
No.

28:14.610 --> 28:18.365
We fear a great many things,
but we fear nothing most of all.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.916
<i>Please go on.</i>
In what manner?

28:21.074 --> 28:23.873
<i>Are you trying to be difficult?</i>
Not at all.

28:24.036 --> 28:27.757
It seems we're capable
of being difficult without trying.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.547
<i>We've spoken about your fears.</i>

28:30.751 --> 28:33.220
<i>Let's speak about your joys.</i>

28:33.420 --> 28:37.300
At present, there's very little
we can think of that brings us joy.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.477
<i>What brought you joy in the past?</i>

28:42.012 --> 28:46.438
We recall enjoying food once.
<i>What was your favourite food?</i>

28:46.850 --> 28:48.852
That, we can't recall.

28:49.645 --> 28:53.616
At present, we feel no joy.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.531
<i>What do you feel?</i>

28:56.735 --> 28:58.408
Nothing.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.325
<i>You're a tough nut to crack, Qohen.</i>

29:02.532 --> 29:05.786
<i>And, of course, I don't mean "nut"
in the pejorative sense.</i>

29:08.080 --> 29:09.206
<i>Let's examine...</i>

29:11.041 --> 29:14.090
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.</i>

29:14.503 --> 29:18.258
<i>Your next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.</i>

29:18.465 --> 29:20.809
What?
<i>If target timetable is attainable,</i>

29:21.009 --> 29:22.477
<i>press one. If not, ent...</i>

29:23.262 --> 29:27.017
<i>Please enter number of minutes needed
for target overruns.</i>

29:27.224 --> 29:30.103
<i>One moment, please.
Management have authorised</i>

29:30.310 --> 29:32.233
<i>a 60-minute overrun.</i>
No, that...

29:32.437 --> 29:34.735
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Leth</i>.
That's nothing... No.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.118
<i>We can finish this session
another time, Qohen.</i>

29:38.318 --> 29:41.993
<i>I think you'd better get back to work.</i>
These entities refuse

29:42.197 --> 29:43.369
to remain crunched.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.951
Each has its own meaning,
but that changes

29:46.159 --> 29:48.207
depending on the following.
<i>Qohen.</i>

29:48.412 --> 29:50.255
Which then changes <i>Deep breath.</i>

29:50.455 --> 29:53.959
Depending on the meaning of...
<i>Deep breath in and out.</i>

29:54.334 --> 29:56.177
<i>Deep breath in...</i>

29:56.962 --> 29:59.761
<i>and out.</i>
All we want is our call.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.800
<i>Yes, your call.</i>

30:02.009 --> 30:04.478
<i>We'll complete this session
another time.</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:14.984
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.</i>

30:15.188 --> 30:17.657
<i>Your next instalment of processed data
is due...</i>

30:17.858 --> 30:20.452
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.</i>

30:20.652 --> 30:24.407
<i>Your next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.</i>

30:24.614 --> 30:26.161
<i>Hello, Qohen Leth.</i>

30:26.366 --> 30:29.165
<i>Are you an entity process?</i>

30:29.494 --> 30:31.917
<i>Have you tried them?</i>

30:32.289 --> 30:34.257
<i>You should try herbs.</i>

30:34.458 --> 30:36.426
<i>I'm happy with herbs.</i>

30:36.626 --> 30:38.720
<i>Way happy.</i>

30:38.920 --> 30:42.094
<i>They should put them
in the drinking water. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

30:42.299 --> 30:44.848
<i>Black fluoride. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

30:45.510 --> 30:46.557
Are you here alone?

30:48.805 --> 30:51.854
We are generally everywhere alone.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.104
I love mystery.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.573
Turns me on.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.610
Well, you don't know me
and I don't know you.

31:01.818 --> 31:02.865
No.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.038
I'm the neighbour.
MM-hm.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.001
There's always a neighbour
at this kind of party.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.213
Care to come to my place?

31:13.413 --> 31:18.635
We'd only disappoint you
as we have countless others.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.048
That's the best line I've heard
all night.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.350
Thank you.
MM.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.227
We must leave now.

31:27.427 --> 31:28.849
Hey, wait.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.852
Wait.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.234
Don't say no.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.774
Just think about it.

31:37.521 --> 31:41.822
If it's not now, some other time.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.996
Just have to call me.

31:47.572 --> 31:51.452
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Leth. Goodbye, Mr.
Leth. Goodbye, Mr. Leth.</i>

31:51.618 --> 31:52.915
Oh!

32:06.133 --> 32:09.683
<i>Next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.</i>

32:09.886 --> 32:12.435
<i>If the target timetable is attainable,
press one.</i>

32:12.639 --> 32:15.142
<i>If not, enter what is needed
for target overrun.</i>

32:15.350 --> 32:18.695
<i>Please enter the number of minutes
needed for target overrun.</i>

32:18.895 --> 32:21.068
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

32:22.482 --> 32:25.326
<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

32:33.326 --> 32:36.455
Go like this.

32:37.914 --> 32:42.340
Ha-ha-ha.
Sideways walks the crab, and...

32:49.176 --> 32:51.053
Ha-ha-ha, oh!

32:58.226 --> 33:00.149
No. No.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.656
Come on.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.625
Yeah.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.165
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.167
No, no, no!

33:19.581 --> 33:22.004
- What? Not now.
<i>- Processed data is due for upload.</i>

33:22.209 --> 33:25.429
<i>Please enter number of minutes
needed for target overrun.</i>

33:25.629 --> 33:29.634
<i>That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.</i>

33:29.841 --> 33:33.812
<i>Please enter the estimated number.</i>
Shut up. Shut up.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.559
<i>That timetable is not authorised.</i>

33:37.098 --> 33:39.726
<i>Please enter the estimated number.</i>
I'm gonna catch them.

33:39.935 --> 33:43.860
<i>That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.</i>

33:44.064 --> 33:47.819
<i>That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.</i>

33:48.026 --> 33:50.074
<i>- No.
- Deep breaths, Qohen.</i>

33:50.278 --> 33:52.398
<i>Not you. No, we won't breathe!
Deep breaths, remember?</i>

33:55.283 --> 33:56.626
And you too!

33:56.826 --> 33:58.954
No!

34:24.396 --> 34:25.739
Hello?

34:25.938 --> 34:28.612
<i>Management says
you've got a problem.</i>

34:52.215 --> 34:56.561
Quinn, you tortured little slut,
that is. Been a long time.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.560
How are you? Still dying, I see.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.732
What are you doing here?
Field work.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.733
I love it. Gets me out of the office
into a snappy uniform. Ha, ha.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.156
You could use a woman's touch,
Quinn.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.327
Eh...

35:16.948 --> 35:18.996
Ah. Management
can't get through to you.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.372
What's the story?

35:21.036 --> 35:25.086
At present, we have difficulty
maintaining our upload schedule.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.590
The entities
are behaving very strangely.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.170
Yeah.

35:31.421 --> 35:34.095
Personnel meltdown.
I've seen plenty of it.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.517
I'd pull you off the pitch

35:36.718 --> 35:39.392
but Management wants
to give you another chance.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.314
Don't ask me why.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.600
Ooh.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.190
Phone trouble, was it?

35:46.394 --> 35:49.022
Tried to fix it yourself, did you?

35:54.444 --> 35:55.866
Wrong tool for the job.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.492
Ball-peen's more for hammering out
dents in sheet metal,

35:59.699 --> 36:02.248
not for close tolerance
phone repair.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.124
It's all about connections, Quinn.

36:08.917 --> 36:15.926
Wires, wireless,
weaving a World Wide Web.

36:16.132 --> 36:19.056
Can't get anything
if you're disconnected.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.973
Voilà.

36:24.307 --> 36:27.060
Tell you what,
this manual work's giving me a thirst.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.862
You've not got a beer
for a working man, have you?

36:30.063 --> 36:31.189
We have tap water.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.900
Yu m-yum.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.160
Thank you.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.540
I miss you, Quinn.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.923
Supervisors
don't make many friends.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.466
You consider us a friend?
Yeah, of course I do.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.885
Of course I do.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.188
So, what's the real problem?

37:07.016 --> 37:09.690
The zero theorem is unproveable.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.315
<i>We still haven't received
our phone call.</i>

37:13.523 --> 37:15.525
<i>You don't trust Management.</i>

37:15.734 --> 37:17.111
<i>Nothing adds up.</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:21.198
No, you got it backwards. Everything
adds up to nothing, that's the point.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.455
What's the point?
Exactly. What's the point of anything?

37:24.659 --> 37:27.879
You've got a case
of the zero theorem heebie-jeebies.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.753
Don't you think working
sucked the soul out of me?

37:30.957 --> 37:34.552
Bet your big bald buns, it did.
I was nowhere near where you are.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.428
You're knocking on the door, Quinn.
No wonder you're stressed.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.224
Sit down.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.018
Sit down.

37:44.471 --> 37:47.315
Do you really have no idea
what you're doing?

37:49.225 --> 37:51.694
We don't care.
All we care about is our call.

37:51.895 --> 37:55.274
Could you inform Management
we want our call and we want it now?

37:55.482 --> 37:57.985
Yes, yes, yes,
God, talk about tunnel vision.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.912
You'll get your call.
You're a bundle of nerves.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.240
You can't work like this.

38:03.448 --> 38:08.045
You're not gonna get that call of yours
all wound up tight like this.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.840
I've got a friend
who might be able to help.

38:13.041 --> 38:18.639
You said you didn't have any friends.
Ouch, Quinn, ouch. That hurts.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.553
It's Qohen.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.477
Q, no U, O-H-E-N.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.522
All right.
No need to spell it out, man.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.224
I've got the picture.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.477
Let Joby handle it.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.125
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. Leth?</i>

38:51.329 --> 38:53.206
<i>Qohen Leth?</i>

39:08.680 --> 39:10.682
Surprise.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.809
Bainsley.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.189
I waited.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.442
You never called.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.620
Oh, you poor thing.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.915
Joby's right, you need me.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.286
You're Mr. Joby's friend?

39:31.494 --> 39:34.998
Well, Joby doesn't have any friends.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.547
I feel so, so holy,

39:40.670 --> 39:44.015
going to the chapel of love.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.343
We prefer not to be touched.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.930
The rent must be outrageous.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.812
Actually, we own the building.

39:53.016 --> 39:56.395
We bought it from an insurance
company some years ago.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.152
There'd been extensive fire damage.

40:00.857 --> 40:04.031
The previous occupants
were an order of monastic monks

40:04.235 --> 40:08.991
who've sworn vows of chastity...

40:10.533 --> 40:13.628
poverty and silence.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.423
Apparently, no one broke the silence
to yell fire.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.878
And what do we have here?

40:23.588 --> 40:25.181
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.842
Goodness me.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.645
What other surprises do you have
for me?

40:31.804 --> 40:33.272
That was a gift from...

40:33.431 --> 40:34.648
Shh.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.068
You have...

40:39.520 --> 40:45.823
the most intriguing bone structure.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.495
So polished.

40:48.029 --> 40:51.374
So, so pure.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.706
Ahh. So pure.

40:57.080 --> 41:01.176
Hey, a mighty big hard drive
you got here.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.800
What work do you do exactly?

41:05.004 --> 41:07.598
Well, I shoot trouble.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.680
Mr. Joby seemed to think

41:09.884 --> 41:12.512
that you might help us get our call?
Yeah.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.769
Yeah, he mentioned the call thing.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.810
You're staring at me.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.817
We're terribly sorry.
Ahh!

41:24.857 --> 41:27.360
I just broke a nail.

41:28.027 --> 41:32.203
On your big, fat, stupid keyboard.
We'll get our first aid kit.

41:33.533 --> 41:37.504
Would you please just kiss it.
Excuse us?

41:37.704 --> 41:41.550
Whenever I hurt myself,
my daddy would kiss it

41:41.833 --> 41:43.335
and make it all better.

41:44.377 --> 41:47.597
Well, we fail to see how...
Please.

41:58.391 --> 41:59.768
You call that a kiss?

42:12.321 --> 42:14.073
There.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.413
All better?

42:16.617 --> 42:18.057
<i>Excuse me,</i>

42:18.119 --> 42:20.998
<i>couldn't help noticing this
young lady's pathological attempts</i>

42:21.164 --> 42:24.668
<i>to project upon you her unresolved
issues of paternal abandonment.</i>

42:24.876 --> 42:28.130
<i>Given the significant age difference
between the two of you...</i>

42:28.337 --> 42:30.214
Nosy bitch.

42:30.423 --> 42:33.643
My daddy didn't abandon me.

42:34.135 --> 42:35.978
He died.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.645
In case you're getting
the wrong idea,

42:39.849 --> 42:42.819
I should tell you
that I don't do sexual intercourse.

42:43.019 --> 42:46.193
I don't care if a guy wraps himself up
like a latex mummy.

42:46.397 --> 42:50.743
But...
But nothing is going inside me.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.037
Way too dangerous.

42:53.237 --> 42:59.085
I'm into tantric,
bio-telemetric interfacing now.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.541
It's smart and safe.

43:01.746 --> 43:07.879
And, God, it just feel so super tingly.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.551
Got anything to eat around here?

43:10.755 --> 43:13.429
I'm starving my ass off.

43:15.843 --> 43:18.972
Ah. What a mess.

43:23.559 --> 43:26.028
You're staring at me again.
Forgive us.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.481
Well, I don't mind.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.237
Just noticing, that's all.

43:30.817 --> 43:33.491
You're a pretty intense guy.

43:33.694 --> 43:38.245
So here you are, Qohen,

43:38.449 --> 43:44.047
locked up all alone
and waiting for...

43:44.247 --> 43:47.376
For what? For a phone call?

43:47.917 --> 43:50.545
So tell me, what's that all about?
Hmm?

43:50.753 --> 43:54.223
No, we've grown weary
explaining ourselves.

43:55.716 --> 44:00.643
But how am I supposed to help
if you don't tell me? Hmm?

44:02.932 --> 44:04.309
Please.

44:04.517 --> 44:06.190
Please.

44:14.861 --> 44:16.204
So come on.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.498
How did it all start?

44:22.201 --> 44:24.374
We're not quite certain.

44:27.748 --> 44:33.346
We must confess
that for good or ill,

44:33.796 --> 44:37.221
that we always wanted
to feel different,

44:37.633 --> 44:39.101
unique.

44:40.887 --> 44:44.733
Objective analysis, however, concluded
that we're as inconsequential

44:44.932 --> 44:46.354
as anyone else.

44:47.351 --> 44:51.606
We are but one
in many single worker bee

44:51.814 --> 44:53.282
in a vast swarm

44:53.482 --> 44:58.454
subject to the same imperatives
as billions of others.

44:59.030 --> 45:05.288
We dulled our discontent
in alcohol, drugs, sex.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.833
And then it happened.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.053
One night...

45:15.963 --> 45:19.058
oh, a long time ago,

45:19.258 --> 45:22.137
we were awakened
by the phone ringing.

45:23.262 --> 45:24.479
We picked it up.

45:24.680 --> 45:28.310
A voice on the other end said:

45:28.517 --> 45:30.986
"Qohen Leth."

45:34.315 --> 45:36.409
But before we could respond,

45:36.609 --> 45:39.829
we felt
this great yawning maul of power

45:40.029 --> 45:42.498
opening through the phone line.

45:42.698 --> 45:47.750
We felt a sudden rush of joy
unlike anything we've ever felt before.

45:47.954 --> 45:51.629
Then we knew quite clearly
that we only had to answer "yes"

45:51.832 --> 45:55.507
and the voice would tell us
the meaning of our life.

45:55.711 --> 45:59.932
The voice would tell us
our special calling.

46:00.132 --> 46:04.057
The voice would give us a reason
for being.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.271
And then?

46:10.393 --> 46:12.316
And then...

46:12.979 --> 46:14.697
in our excitement,

46:15.147 --> 46:18.947
we dropped the receiver,
disconnecting ourselves.

46:23.114 --> 46:27.119
You've been waiting for a call-back
ever since?

46:27.285 --> 46:29.458
What other reason is there
to pick up the phone?

46:29.662 --> 46:32.131
Well, communication for one.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.083
It's mostly unnecessary.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.294
But that's what we're doing now.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.847
In a manner of speaking.

46:42.383 --> 46:47.139
So all this time, you've been waiting
for a mysterious voice

46:47.346 --> 46:50.350
to tell you what to do
with your life.

46:52.143 --> 46:56.614
Wow. Probably just
a cold call anyway.

46:56.856 --> 47:01.111
If you hadn't dropped the phone,
you'd own a time share in Majorca.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.367
Big deal. Heh.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.331
Do you really believe everything
you've just told me?

47:13.539 --> 47:14.836
Yes.

47:17.293 --> 47:18.920
Okay.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.177
Okay.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.052
I can help you.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.559
But don't go away.

47:29.764 --> 47:33.234
<i>And I'll be back in a tail shake,
all right?</i>

47:47.281 --> 47:49.375
<i>- Bainsley?
- Bob, buzz me in.</i>

47:50.576 --> 47:52.954
<i>Bob who?
Bob, (have to take a wicked pee.</i>

47:53.162 --> 47:55.130
<i>Buzz me in, Scotty.</i>

47:55.331 --> 47:56.548
Our name isn't Scotty.

47:56.749 --> 47:57.966
<i>I know that, Bob.</i>

47:58.167 --> 47:59.669
Our name isn't Bob.
Come on.

47:59.877 --> 48:02.050
<i>I'm doing the tinkle dance here.</i>

48:14.016 --> 48:15.859
Where's your bathroom?

48:16.811 --> 48:18.529
Where's your bathroom?

48:18.729 --> 48:20.197
It's here.

48:38.457 --> 48:39.504
How did you get in?

48:39.708 --> 48:41.756
Fucking magic.

48:41.961 --> 48:44.305
Excuse my French.

48:45.047 --> 48:49.598
Holy shit, man, I think I did some
renal damage holding it in that long.

48:49.802 --> 48:51.304
Slim got stuck in traffic.

48:51.512 --> 48:52.638
Chubs drove, Bob.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.815
Fast as I could.

49:01.313 --> 49:02.405
Sign here.
What?

49:02.606 --> 49:04.108
A receipt of delivery.

49:04.316 --> 49:07.490
We're delivering...
Bob. Assigned to help you. Sign.

49:09.530 --> 49:12.283
Brilliant.
We'll pick him up in exactly four hours.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.243
Don't lose him.
Don't lose him.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.414
I wouldn't mess with the clones
if I were you.

49:18.622 --> 49:22.217
They look harmless, but they'd
just as soon flame you to death.

49:23.085 --> 49:27.056
This is a...
This is a creepy place you got here.

49:27.756 --> 49:29.474
Are you okay?

49:29.675 --> 49:31.552
Actually, we're dying.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.980
For me to be with, I mean.
You're a scary looking guy, Bob.

49:35.181 --> 49:37.400
Would you please stop
calling us Bob?

49:37.600 --> 49:40.069
What do you want me to call you?
Mr. Leth.

49:40.269 --> 49:44.274
Leth? No, no, it's too wormy.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.860
Qohen, then.
Q, no U, O-H-E-N.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.570
Gotta buy another vowel.

49:49.778 --> 49:51.872
Q.
Or Q.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.665
Yeah, Q will do.

49:53.866 --> 49:55.368
Q is you.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.203
Happy now?

49:57.411 --> 49:58.458
Why are you here?

49:58.662 --> 50:01.381
Old man assigned me
to get you up and running again.

50:01.582 --> 50:03.050
The old man?
The boss.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.173
The Darth Vader
of microprocessing.

50:05.377 --> 50:08.221
The guy I call Daddy Dearest,
also known as Management.

50:08.422 --> 50:10.971
You're Management's son?
The one and only.

50:11.175 --> 50:15.396
Heir to his dark throne,
stuck working this summer job.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.815
Order us a pizza.
I missed breakfast

50:18.015 --> 50:19.892
and this is gonna take a while.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.944
We have oatmeal if you chose...
If I wanted to vomit.

50:23.771 --> 50:26.365
Order the pie, double cheese.

50:29.109 --> 50:33.489
Fuck. Fuck.
How can you work like this?

50:33.948 --> 50:36.827
Oh, it's fucking ridiculous.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.918
Fuck. Fuck.

50:42.331 --> 50:44.880
<i>I can't stand people gawking at me.</i>

50:45.084 --> 50:47.086
<i>Dad, Dad.</i>

50:47.503 --> 50:48.629
<i>Bob's on the job.</i>

50:51.840 --> 50:53.092
That's better.

50:53.300 --> 50:57.680
Who can work...? Who can work
with him looking over your shoulder?

50:57.930 --> 51:00.183
We have nothing to hide.

51:00.933 --> 51:04.107
The point is moot since we're not
working for him any longer.

51:04.311 --> 51:07.315
Yeah, right,
keep telling yourself that.

51:08.315 --> 51:12.661
What do you mean?
The old man is not done with you yet.

51:13.153 --> 51:14.405
But we're done with him.

51:15.656 --> 51:18.500
Like those preceding us,
we have burnt out.

51:18.701 --> 51:20.703
We have decided to quit.
Smart move.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.585
Too bad you can't.
What do you mean? Mr. Joby...

51:23.789 --> 51:26.588
Joby will tell you
whatever the old man wants him to.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.170
You're a tool.
The old man uses everybody.

51:29.378 --> 51:30.925
That yummy night nurse chick?

51:31.088 --> 51:32.556
Bainsley?
Tool.

51:33.007 --> 51:34.384
No.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.516
She promised to help us.
We are waiting for her.

51:37.720 --> 51:41.065
Wait all you want. She's not
gonna be back. Your call girl,

51:41.265 --> 51:42.983
she was paid by the hour.

51:43.851 --> 51:45.853
We don't believe you.

51:46.937 --> 51:50.862
So, what do you think?

51:51.650 --> 51:54.529
This thing is years ahead
of the competition.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.660
It works on nerve endings,
of course,

51:56.864 --> 52:00.289
but it's also synced directly
to the brain synapses.

52:00.492 --> 52:03.120
And Joby said
it was one of your projects.

52:03.329 --> 52:05.377
We can't imagine.

52:05.873 --> 52:10.219
We never thought of our project
actually having any purpose.

52:11.086 --> 52:15.717
Top secret.
I'm the cyberspace test pilot.

52:15.924 --> 52:18.302
But first,
you have to do something for me.

52:24.266 --> 52:25.609
Voilà.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.562
And one size fits all.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.865
Isn't it dangerous?
Oh.

52:31.357 --> 52:34.611
Depends on your idea of danger.

52:37.946 --> 52:39.198
Just trust me.

52:39.406 --> 52:45.038
Suit up, plug in,
and click on my website at midnight.

52:52.044 --> 52:56.845
You're going out like that?
They can look, but they can't touch.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.516
And don't be late.

53:02.888 --> 53:04.765
I can't wait.

53:09.269 --> 53:12.398
<i>So here's the deal, Q,
straight from the old man himself.</i>

53:12.606 --> 53:15.234
You go back to work
on this nasty Zippity-T...

53:15.442 --> 53:18.446
We're no longer interested.
And in return,

53:18.654 --> 53:20.531
I get you your call.

53:21.031 --> 53:23.454
You? You will get us our call?

53:23.659 --> 53:27.755
Yes, I will get you your call.
You're not the only genius around here.

53:27.955 --> 53:31.084
I'm downloading your Shrink-Rom files
even as we speak.

53:31.291 --> 53:34.261
Those sessions are private.
Sure they are.

53:37.381 --> 53:41.056
Pizza! Pizza!

53:43.971 --> 53:45.644
Pizza.

53:45.931 --> 53:47.604
Ooh.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.403
Nice.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.822
That's nice.

53:55.190 --> 53:57.739
Uh... Where do I put it?

53:58.527 --> 53:59.870
Hmm.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.834
Not Just A Pizza.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.837
So...

54:09.496 --> 54:10.748
cash or charge?

54:12.833 --> 54:14.460
Hey.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.220
Thank you.

54:22.468 --> 54:25.938
What are you staring at?
Uh, sorry. Shit. Nothing.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.600
Uh, um... Sorry.
Oops. Heh-heh.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.019
Wrong answer.

54:31.226 --> 54:32.523
Thank you.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.782
Hey.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.079
Thank you.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.783
Aaah!

54:45.949 --> 54:48.168
Holy shit.

54:48.410 --> 54:52.631
Oh, I think I got this hormonal
paradigm shift going on right now.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.378
Was she looking at me funny?

54:54.541 --> 54:56.964
We've grown accustomed to people
looking at us funny.

54:57.169 --> 54:58.967
Yeah, but you are funny looking.

54:59.171 --> 55:02.050
<i>♪ Not Just A Pizza, yum, yum ♪♪</i>

55:03.342 --> 55:05.344
All right, I gotta run.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.304
You can have the rest.

55:08.096 --> 55:10.849
Our diet precludes pizza.

55:11.058 --> 55:13.277
All right, well, save it.

55:13.477 --> 55:17.448
I'll study your files,
be back first thing tomorrow.

55:22.903 --> 55:25.247
You're late.
I'm right on time, Bob.

55:25.447 --> 55:28.291
No excuses. Don't
let this happen again.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.790
I'll be back, Q, you can trust me.
Let's go.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.246
Why would we trust you?

55:32.454 --> 55:34.923
You trusted everybody else.
Might as well trust me.

55:35.123 --> 55:38.218
Lose the "we" thing. I can't work with it.
Too annoying.

55:38.418 --> 55:40.967
Just ask the doc
if you don't believe me.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.820

Something special

57:18.560 --> 57:20.813
for a special guy. Heh, heh, heh,

57:20.979 --> 57:24.483
We're not at all sure
it's quite us.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.785
Don't be silly.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.029
We no longer drink.

57:29.237 --> 57:31.660
But you can do

57:31.865 --> 57:34.459
You can drink

57:49.883 --> 57:51.180
MM.

57:55.055 --> 57:57.149
Huh.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.442

58:03.814 --> 58:05.157

58:16.034 --> 58:17.536
MM.

58:18.328 --> 58:20.251
Do you feel this?

58:21.331 --> 58:22.548
But it's not real.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.592
It's better than real.

58:24.793 --> 58:27.967
You're in your computer.
I'm in mine.

58:28.505 --> 58:32.351
We're connected by memory chips
and fibre optics.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.429
And we're safe here.

58:35.887 --> 58:37.889
Just trust me.

58:40.809 --> 58:43.528
And let's get
this party started.

58:44.396 --> 58:46.364
Ah! Oh! Ha, ha, ha.

58:47.983 --> 58:49.530
Ooh!

58:59.828 --> 59:02.422
Hey, come on.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.966
Just come.
Ha, ha, ha.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.175
Hey. Go. Whoo!

59:09.713 --> 59:10.760
Yah!

59:15.761 --> 59:17.513
Here, here.

59:17.721 --> 59:18.973
Yeah.

59:23.018 --> 59:24.565
Hey?

59:27.773 --> 59:29.275
Qohen?

59:29.691 --> 59:31.284
Qohen?

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.801
Who knew?

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:34.131
Can we die here?

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:36.345
I don't think so.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:41.021
I hope.
You're not supposed to.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:01.834
Apparently, Management has assigned
his own son to get us our call.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:06.714
We really think that he's far too young
to be entrusted with the responsibility

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:10.543
of such an extent that...
<i>Oh, don't be such a wuss, Q.</i>

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.494
How did you tamper
with our Shrink-Rom programme?

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.252
Oh, it's easy. She's a tool too,
in case you didn't notice.

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:53.093
Anyway, how long have you been
talking like the Queen of England?

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:57.215
Longer than we can remember.
Stop. Fuck off.

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:01.268
A former therapist suggested it
as a way to...

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:02.515
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.518
As a way to closer relate
to humankind.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.316
Yeah, you keep it up,
I'm gonna hurl.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:13.071
Dear old Dad says I can
use Mancom to get you your call,

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.820
as long as you keep
crunching, of course.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.072
He's all hot on you.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.950
We can't imagine why.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.285
I've been wondering
about that too.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:29.338
I figure there can only
really be one reason.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.792
You're the one, Q.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:38.472
You are the chosen one.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:44.561
You're the one the oracle said
would someday come to us.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:55.314
No. My guess: The old man picked you
because you're such a work dog.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.616
The man says mush,
you hit the harness.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.490
You drag that sled
till you drop.

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:05.161
You have any idea what
the zero theorem is all about?

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.536
Never seemed important.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:14.295
Okay. Here's the poop, the whole
poop, and nothing but the poop.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:19.221
You're trying to prove
that the universe is all for nothing.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:23.051
All matter, all energy, all life,

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:26.637
it's just this one-time-only
Big Bang glitch.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:31.229
Expanding universe
will eventually contract

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:34.312
into a super dense black hole.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:37.940
Gravitational forces will be so strong
that everything

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.992
will get squeezed
into a point of zero dimension,

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.694
and "poof" the centre disappears.

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:45.621
No space, no time, no life,
no afterlife, nothing.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.621
Nada, zilch, zip, zero.
Stop.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.999
How would anyone believe
such a horrible thing?

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.797
What's so horrible?
I believe it.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:57.171
Nothing's perfect.
Nothing lasts forever.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:00.379
It's nothing to worry about
if you really think about it.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:03.719
Your father should've assigned
the zero theorem project to you.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:07.553
Well, he's been trying to,
for as long as I can remember.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:10.981
But I refused to work on Zip-T.
Why?

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.979
Well, because I'm nobody's tool.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.026
All right, that's your job.

Did you know...

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.715
that more than 33 different
aboriginal tribes believe

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:07.716

in the lower digestive tract?

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.047

knowledge of each other's existence.

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:49.332
but I need you...
I need you to believe me.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:55.797
You said you never wanted

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.765

will assign someone else

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:21.280

We have work to do.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.860

to a special place,

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.289

And you need me.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:26.141
And I need to be needed so bad.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.275
Just come with me.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:39.025

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:42.911
Just run away with me.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.580

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.022
We feel like a rat in a rat trap.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.979

01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:33.806
I'm tired. I'm stressed.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:37.188

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:41.193

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:55.203

- Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.587

Jeez. What are you doing?

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:45.756
Get out of my way.
Punks!

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.464
Fuck you.
I know, I know, I'm fucking...

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.925

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.276
A little tail would make that thing

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.821
You ever have a girlfriend?

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:18.081
Yeah, we had a girlfriend
when we were your age.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:21.129
We spent every possible
moment with our long walks,

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.675
movies, lying in the backyard
staring up at the stars

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.505
until her parents called her in,
sent us home.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:31.761
Very much in love with her,
as we recall.

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.512
What ever happened to her?

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:38.101
We married her,
she eventually divorced us

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:40.353
and we never saw her again.

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:43.026
Thanks for that happy,
hopeful little parable.

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:47.027
I can hardly wait for my
own first divorce. Heh.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:51.948
Yeah, more, more. That's it, yeah.
I don't know any girls my age.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.622
Seems like getting old
would be pretty boring.

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:59.543
Old people, they just... They do
the same thing day after day after day.

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:03.168
Like listening to the same song
over and over and over.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:05.090
Yeah, maybe it's a good song.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:08.169
Maybe. After a while, it gets old.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:11.722
Ah!
Get out of here. Go.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.302
You know, I'm 15.

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:20.060
I'm 15 and already tons of stuff
bores me to death.

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:23.525
Think about what will happen
when I get as old as you.

01:24:28.438 --> 01:24:30.156
I'm about to crash.

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:31.779
I need some food.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.952
Do us a couple of dogs, Q?

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:37.247
A couple of wieners
for a couple of weenies.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:42.419
Can we have some relish on ours?
Of course. You got it.

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:46.627
You know, I just met her,
but I really miss Bainsley.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:49.335
Must be killing you,
losing a doll like that.

01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:51.796
Sorry, man.
I'm going.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.098
<i>Just come with me.</i>

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.351
<i>We connected.</i>

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.274
<i>You need me.</i>

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:12.112
<i>And I need to be needed so bad.</i>

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:27.006
What's the matter? Just realising what
a jerk you were dumping Bainsley?

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:29.674
I'm just thinking...

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.128
Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:37.759
I told you.
I've been working on it.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:40.970
That's what I like about you,
man.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:44.689
You're not too old a dog
to learn new tricks.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.283
What's wrong?
I'm just dizzy. I'm dizzy.

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:00.410
Just a little dizzy.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:04.622
You're burning up.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.079
Happens when I don't sleep.
Not a big deal.

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:10.211
You need medical attention.
Just get me aspirin

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.088
and run me a cool bath.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:19.638
I feel better already.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:24.054
I just need some sleep.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.158
<i>Bob?</i>

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:38.944
<i>Bob?</i>

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.128
Unh!

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:48.164
I... No.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.834
I don't wanna take...

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:54.504
I knew nothing.

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:11.312
Ow.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.654
Unh!

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.460
You have made
a very big mistake.

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:35.712
He just needs some rest.
Yeah.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:38.961
Come on.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:44.509
- I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
- Here we go.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:48.053
We'll be back tomorrow
for the hardware.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:50.056
Don't touch anything.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:53.059
We have notified
your supervisor.

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:34.311
Quinn, you bastard.

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:39.768
I just called by

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:43.401
to say thank you
for getting me fired from my job.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:46.279
You're still a tool.

01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:49.657
At least I'm not playing patty-cake
in a bathtub

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:52.284
with a teenage boy, you sick freak.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.245
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:56.042
I know what I know.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.414
I had a good job till you came along
and you fucked it up

01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:03.751
and you fucked up Zip-T
and you fucked up poor old Bob.

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:07.213
Well, I'm here to say fuck you
and the entity around it all.

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:11.095
That's F-U-Q-U, Quinn!

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:15.312
You know my name.
I know who you are.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.432
Leth!

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:21.435
Do you?

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:20.456
Unh!

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:41.848
I'm afraid you won't
find my son here, Mr. Leth.

01:32:42.766 --> 01:32:45.019
He's been hospitalised.

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:46.443
Is he all right?

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:51.570
If I believed in miracles,
I'd be praying for one now.

01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:53.739
He's not well.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:56.787
My son's never been well.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:33:00.367
I've tried to protect him, but
he's always chafed at my touch.

01:33:00.867 --> 01:33:04.292
This morning, he stole a car
from my vintage collection.

01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:06.919
Are you real
or are you just in my mind?

01:33:07.123 --> 01:33:10.502
It doesn't matter at all. You're
part of the neural net now.

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:15.098
So there's no answer?
Depends on the question.

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:16.470
What I'm living for?

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:20.520
That's a good question, Mr. Leth,
posed to the entirely wrong person.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.940
You seem to have mistaken me
for a considerably higher power.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.360
I'm not the source of your call.
I'm not God or the devil.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.404
I'm just a man seeking the truth.

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:34.109
What truth if...?
Turn around and look.

01:33:34.567 --> 01:33:35.910
That's it.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.742
Chaos encapsulated.

01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:42.284
That's all there is at the end,

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:45.371
just as it was at the beginning.

01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:48.297
There it is then.
You've proved the zero theorem.

01:33:48.498 --> 01:33:52.423
Not quite. Mancom is still,
as you said, crunching the data.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:57.007
Why would you want to prove
that all is for nothing?

01:33:57.215 --> 01:34:00.685
I never said all is for nothing.
I'm a businessman, Mr. Leth.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.558
Nothing is for nothing.

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:08.231
What?
There's money in ordering disorder.

01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:12.484
Chaos pays, Mr. Leth. Chaos
comprises a rich vein of ore

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:15.738
that with Mancom's muscle,
will be all mine

01:34:15.942 --> 01:34:17.285
to mine.

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:21.493
The saddest aspect of mankind's
need to believe in a God,

01:34:21.698 --> 01:34:25.077
or to put it another way,
a purpose greater than this life,

01:34:25.285 --> 01:34:27.663
is that it makes this life
meaningless.

01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:31.921
You see, this is all just a way station
on the road to promised eternity.

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:33.798
The reason I chose you...

01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:36.050
I mean, rather perversely,
I admit,

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:40.475
is because you represent
the antithesis of my project.

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:41.972
A man of faith.

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:45.272
You see, you've persisted in
believing that a phone call

01:34:45.471 --> 01:34:48.850
could give your life meaning.
You've waited and waited,

01:34:49.058 --> 01:34:52.858
and as a result,
you've led a meaningless life.

01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:58.027
I'm sorry, but I no longer
require your services.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:03.369
You pervert! You devil!

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:04.745
You monster!

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:07.122
You tear me up,
charge me interest.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:10.957
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I
no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:11.581 --> 01:35:14.460
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth.
I no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:17.921
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth.
I no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:21.887
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth.
I no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:25.270
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth.
I no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:28.940
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth.
I no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:32.068
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Leth.
I no longer require your services.</i>

01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:36.944
<i>Mancom, making
sense of the good things in life.</i>

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:41.578
<i>Mancom, making sense
of the good things in life.</i>

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:46.495
<i>Mancom, making sense
of the good things in life.</i>

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:51.455
<i>Mancom, making sense
of the good things in life.</i>

01:35:51.663 --> 01:35:54.587
<i>Mancom,
making good things of man life.</i>

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:57.044
<i>Man things in good...</i>

01:35:58.962 --> 01:36:00.760
<i>Making good things...</i>

01:36:00.964 --> 01:36:02.307
<i>Making...</i>

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:05.807
<i>Making man life... Making man life...
Making man life...</i>

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.934
<i>Making man life... Making man life...
Making man life...</i>

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:24.287
Oh.

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:27.369
