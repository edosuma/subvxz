-Cute and cuddly boys.

-I am smiling Private, and
you know how I hate that.

-Coming Skipper.

Well, I did note that
the lemurs were unusually

01:40.030 --> 01:41.690
quiet during the
nocturnal hours.

01:41.690 --> 01:44.500
-Perhaps it's because
they're not there.

-Ringtail, you can't just
wander off like that.

-If Alice were to take
notice of your absence,

02:24.540 --> 02:27.130
the zoo would be put
into total lockdown.

-You can't move to the park.

-Stand down men.

a bang up idea.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.340
-Skipper, you can't be serious.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.610
-Lemurless silent
nights, Private.

03:18.610 --> 03:21.830
-But one mistake, and our whole
operation could be compromised.

03:21.830 --> 03:22.530
-Nah.

to fly under the radar.

This tunnel is your ticket
in and out of the zoo.

more of a guideline.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.630
-It's upscale and very spacious.

04:12.630 --> 04:13.650
-Right, Phil.

04:13.650 --> 04:16.020
We could use a
classier environment.

to throw poo at.

-Woo-hoo!

19:30.620 --> 19:31.960
-Kowalski, what happened?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.780
-Judging by the
vibration of my voice,

19:33.780 --> 19:35.800
I'd say the cloning
machine overloaded

19:35.800 --> 19:37.850
and is about to
explode beneath us.

19:40.790 --> 19:43.240
-The Higgs boson particle!

19:43.240 --> 19:46.250

-These are the last dodos ever.

19:58.910 --> 20:03.030
-Gentlemen, final battle of
bird versus nature ends now.

20:03.030 --> 20:07.150
At stake is the survival
of an entire species.

20:07.150 --> 20:09.740
Some of us probably
won't make it through.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.720
But this mission
is bigger than us,

20:11.720 --> 20:14.930
and our tolerance
for excruciating pain

20:14.930 --> 20:15.990
is bigger than--

20:15.990 --> 20:17.230
-Skipper, while
you were talking,

belonging to you?

He was showering me with the
wacky bird tribute, which

21:27.030 --> 21:32.250
it was cabooming, and is
so not cool with the king!
