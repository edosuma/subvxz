But word on the street is he's
out here begging most Saturdays.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.962
He'll be here.
Don't worry about it.
God, hunting is awesome, Dennis!

09:56.964 --> 09:59.297
Yeah.
You get to wear sweet clothes
and get wasted all day.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.633
It's just like our normal lives,
except at the end of it,

10:01.635 --> 10:03.902
we get to put our nuts
in some dude's mouth.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.805
Uh, yeah.
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about that aspect of it.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.174
What's up?
You're not happy with the plan?
Look, dude.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.409
We've been tea bagging
Cricket since high school.
Yeah!

10:11.411 --> 10:13.211
I feel like we need
to make some progress.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.314
I think we should give him
a gorilla mask.
What's a gorilla mask?

10:16.316 --> 10:20.318
You put something sticky
all over his face. And then
sprinkle it with shaved pubes.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.356
Mmm, no, I don't like it.
What? What's not to like?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.057
Cricket with a face full
of pubes? Hilarious.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.193
But where are we supposed
to get that many pubes, man?
We shave!

10:28.195 --> 10:31.763
That's gonna be a problem.
I laser. It's like
a turtle shell down there.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.066
What?
Yeah. Look, man. Classics
are classics for a reason, okay?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.469
Why go and mess with that?
Well, it's called
progress, Dennis.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.005
I don't want to make progress!
We're sticking with
the tea bagging!

10:40.007 --> 10:41.406
But tea bagging
doesn't even leave a mark!
Well, fine!

10:41.408 --> 10:45.010
I'll dip my nuts in ink or
something and then put it in
his mouth! That make you happy?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.112
Well-- Yeah, actually.
I think that's
a pretty good idea.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.749
- It leaves a mark all over him.
- Holy shit. I'm glad
we just thought of it.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.183
So we can dunk him down
and, like-- Whoo!
Cheers, man.

just do that?
I'm not doing that, Dennis.

No. That was
incredibly dangerous.
Let's go polish off that case.

he was capable of that.

Of small plates
of things.

Many small items
on a hot plate.
He mostly just heated it up.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.794
And we thought maybe if he saw
or was near the hot plate
one more time--

12:09.796 --> 12:11.429
It would make him feel--
Right, right, right, right.

No, I prefer the white meat.
I always have.
Yeah. So it's not that guy.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.964
putting your balls
in each other's mouths.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.733
It's fun.
It's funny.

19:28.735 --> 19:32.470
I just don't understand
your generation.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.906
[ Laughs ]

19:34.908 --> 19:38.342
Raccoon meat!
Bullshit!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.311
What?
That was human meat
and I know it!

19:40.313 --> 19:42.713
Look! I don't give a shit
what you think.
<i>Oh, really?</i>

19:42.715 --> 19:47.351
I'm gonna chop off a piece
of that fat little calf muscle
of yours, Frank,

19:47.353 --> 19:48.953
and I'm gonna eat it!
Oh, yes.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.190
- We're gonna put it on
the hot plate, right?
- Yes, Charlie. Get him!

19:52.192 --> 19:55.293
- Oh! You can't run from me!
- Get him! Get him!

19:55.295 --> 19:58.095
And I guess the hunt
is on once again.
<i>Indeed it is.</i>

19:58.097 --> 20:02.433
-They're gonna have so much fun.
-Oh, those two are gonna
have a blast, huh?

20:02.435 --> 20:07.405
So I guess the only thing
that's left is to figure out
what to do with Mr. Cricket.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.441
Yeah. Oh, what to do,
what to do.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.477
I guess it's just us.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.613
It's just you
and us...
[ Crunching Food ]

20:15.615 --> 20:21.552
and a couple pairs
of sour, sweaty balls.
