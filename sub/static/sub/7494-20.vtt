WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.770
Last time on Make It Pop...

00:02.803 --> 00:04.538
Valerie: How could
you do this to me?!

00:04.572 --> 00:07.341
Jodi: We've come too
far to quit now.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.542
Is the play ours yet?

00:08.576 --> 00:09.410
Mr. Stark: Let the show go on!

00:09.443 --> 00:11.145
Sun Hi: No sleep tonight!

00:11.179 --> 00:11.945
(all yelling)

00:11.979 --> 00:13.647
We are not
ready for this.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.150
It's on.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.719
Mr. Stark: Welcome to a very...

00:18.752 --> 00:22.956
...Special evening of theatre.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.525
Now ladies and gentlemen...

00:24.558 --> 00:27.161
I proudly present...

00:27.195 --> 00:29.563
"Hunting Dorothy".

00:29.597 --> 00:34.902
(applause)

00:34.935 --> 00:35.936
The Chang Pool.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.839
Only five million dollars
to get your name on it.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.941
Dorothy, Where are you?

00:40.974 --> 00:43.711
(applause)

00:43.744 --> 00:44.945
How you doing?

00:44.978 --> 00:48.716
*

00:48.749 --> 00:49.983
Tin Woodman!

00:50.017 --> 00:54.021
We must find the evil Dorothy
who's crushed a citizen of Oz.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.190
Witches aren't citizens.

00:56.224 --> 01:00.428
So although it isn't technically
illegal to crush them,

01:00.461 --> 01:02.029
it's still rude.

01:02.062 --> 01:06.700
And then to take off with
her shoes-- super rude!

01:06.734 --> 01:10.138
The Great Oz has promised me
a brain if I find Dorothy.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.873
At last, I will be able
to think great thoughts.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.542
The Wizard said he'd give me

01:14.575 --> 01:16.710
a heart that would make
everyone love me.

01:16.744 --> 01:20.814
Let's find her before
she drops a house on us.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.082
That's how she gets you.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.717
(laughter)

01:23.751 --> 01:25.586
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:25.619 --> 01:31.659
*

01:31.692 --> 01:33.060
Line?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.196
I am the LION!

01:35.229 --> 01:37.064
I am the Lion.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.068
Who dares come to...

01:41.101 --> 01:41.935
Line?

01:41.969 --> 01:43.704
Come into my forest!!

01:43.737 --> 01:44.738
Not yet, Caleb!

01:44.772 --> 01:47.608
*

01:47.641 --> 01:48.909
...Line?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.711
Corki! You can do it!

01:50.744 --> 01:52.146
Just wing it!

01:52.180 --> 01:54.648
I'm not the 'winging it' type!

01:54.682 --> 01:56.817
The Wizard said he'd
give you great courage

01:56.850 --> 02:00.654
if you help us find Dorothy.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.655
Line...

02:02.856 --> 02:05.025
(frustrated noises)

02:05.058 --> 02:08.796
*

02:08.829 --> 02:11.232
The Wicked Witch
followed Dorothy to...

02:11.265 --> 02:13.667
the Forest of Doom.

02:13.701 --> 02:19.106
*

02:19.139 --> 02:20.174
Line?

02:20.208 --> 02:25.145
*

02:25.179 --> 02:27.648
Just close the curtain!
Close the curtain!

02:27.681 --> 02:33.854
*

02:33.887 --> 02:35.256
* Make it pop,

02:35.289 --> 02:37.258
* Woo, woo,

02:37.291 --> 02:38.826
* Make it pop,

02:38.859 --> 02:41.595
* Woo, woo,

02:41.629 --> 02:44.665
* I can't wait,
No I can't wait *

02:44.698 --> 02:47.568
* No, I can't wait,
no, I can't wait. *

02:47.601 --> 02:49.002
* So make it pop,

02:49.036 --> 02:51.205
* We're bout to, We're
bout to blow, *

02:51.239 --> 02:52.806
* Wait till we drop,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.808
* Oh yeah, we're
ready to go, *

02:54.842 --> 02:56.043
* Ain't gonna stop,

02:56.076 --> 02:58.246
* When is it time
for the show, *

02:58.279 --> 03:01.048
* We make it, you
make it, they make it, *

03:01.081 --> 03:04.752
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop! *

03:05.253 --> 03:06.186
*

03:06.220 --> 03:07.955
You played the cowardice
of the lion perfectly.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.790
I felt your fear.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.725
Because I was afraid.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.160
I'm always prepared.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.028
I prepare for school, music...

03:15.062 --> 03:17.130
heck, I prepare for sleep.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.333
But for this show,
I'm not prepared!

03:19.367 --> 03:22.603
Not prepared and adorable.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.904
Boop!

03:23.937 --> 03:25.706
(giggles)

03:25.739 --> 03:28.342
Jared this is not the time
for your irresistible charm.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.111
Ha! Good one, Corki.

03:33.381 --> 03:33.947
What?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.617
Oh. You're serious.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.251
Oh, don't worry!

03:37.285 --> 03:38.686
I'm gonna save this play!

03:38.719 --> 03:39.287
*

03:39.320 --> 03:40.654
What is wrong with her?

03:40.688 --> 03:41.989
We rehearsed.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.825
You curtseying and saying
"I'd like to thank my fans"

03:44.858 --> 03:47.895
over and over while we build
sets doesn't really count.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.763
(gasps)

03:49.797 --> 03:52.933
I don't even have to
try to make you look bad.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.001
Ha! That's right.

03:54.034 --> 03:57.070
We can do that on our
own, thank you very much.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.672
Wait. I just burned
myself, right?

03:58.706 --> 03:59.873
So bad you'll need aloe.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.342
*

04:01.375 --> 04:02.910
The Forest of Doom.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.179
No one has ever come
out of here alive.

04:06.213 --> 04:09.350
I think the Lion
wants to say...

04:09.383 --> 04:11.919
Dorothy will be
easier to catch!

04:11.952 --> 04:15.022
I'm not the smart one, but if
everyone who enters is doomed,

04:15.055 --> 04:17.257
doesn't that also make us...

04:17.291 --> 04:19.059
you know what? Never mind.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.260
(laughter)

04:20.294 --> 04:21.662
*

04:21.695 --> 04:22.162
(shrieks)

04:22.195 --> 04:25.065
Raaaaaaaaawr!

04:25.098 --> 04:27.901
Who dares enter
the Troll Kingdom?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.169
Don't worry I got this.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.371
There's no Troll in Oz.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.439
There is now.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.974
You guys were dying out here.
I had to do something.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.208
Just go with it.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.043
(clears throat)

04:36.076 --> 04:40.981
Troll guy, we're
looking for Dorothy.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.249
Can you help?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.784
Of course.

04:43.817 --> 04:49.423
We'll go on foot
paTROLL. Heh heh.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.326
I'm not just
handsome, I'm witty.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.727
Are you always
this self-posessed?!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.095
Don't yell at him, Jodi!

04:55.128 --> 04:56.296
He's just trying to help.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.899
Not a word out of
you until he shows up?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.901
The guy who bet
he could kiss you.

05:00.934 --> 05:01.602
(gasps)

05:01.635 --> 05:03.070
Hey, we were
moving past that.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.204
*

05:04.237 --> 05:05.373
(panicked yells)

05:05.406 --> 05:07.408
(CRASH!!!!)

05:07.441 --> 05:08.241
Caleb!?

05:08.275 --> 05:10.143
Perfect.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.946
Caleb might not have
a chin like Jared,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.181
but he's trying to help.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.049
But why does it
always end in

05:16.083 --> 05:18.251
a crash, explosion,
or detention?

05:18.285 --> 05:20.688
You're blocking me
from the audience!

05:20.721 --> 05:22.690
Do people really
need to see this...

05:22.723 --> 05:24.825
...one more time?!

05:24.858 --> 05:26.860
It's better than
watching you do nothing!

05:26.894 --> 05:28.796
(lightning cracks)

05:28.829 --> 05:31.965
*

05:31.999 --> 05:35.869
The Troll Prince will take
his leave before the Witch

05:35.903 --> 05:40.107
takes vengeance for
coating her with paint.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.809
Sorry again, Val.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.278
Scarecrow.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.148
You should be glad
to have no brains.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.317
They get you in trouble.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.351
Lion...

05:51.385 --> 05:53.821
Ruler of the forest...

05:53.854 --> 05:56.156
...Too afraid. Ha!

05:58.025 --> 05:59.960
The Tin Woodman...

05:59.993 --> 06:02.730
I prefer Glimmering
Woodwoman,

06:02.763 --> 06:05.132
slightly more upscale
and gender specific.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.435
I prefer your heartless
self be pounded into knives,

06:07.468 --> 06:10.037
forks, and spoons for
my castle's kitchen.

06:10.070 --> 06:10.904
(cackles)

06:10.938 --> 06:13.941
Nobody puts me in
a cutlery drawer.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.042
Valerie!

06:15.075 --> 06:16.910
You're completely off-script
and you promised to help!

06:16.944 --> 06:18.879
And you stole the
play from me!

06:18.912 --> 06:20.380
Deal with it!

06:20.414 --> 06:24.284
You wanna rewrite the
play, you deal with it.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.318
Come on, girls!

06:25.352 --> 06:28.321
This pompom shaking
witch won't take us down.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.857
(shouting)

06:29.890 --> 06:30.458
Bring it!

06:30.491 --> 06:31.859
(whistle blows)

06:31.892 --> 06:36.129
*

06:36.163 --> 06:37.397
(Sun Hi's battle cry)

06:37.431 --> 06:42.870
*

06:42.903 --> 06:44.337
I'm supposed to
be chasing you.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.338
(yelps)

06:45.372 --> 06:46.540
*

06:46.574 --> 06:47.274
Caleb: Run!

06:47.307 --> 06:53.947
*

06:53.981 --> 06:55.248
I win!

06:55.282 --> 06:58.051
I will find Dorothy
and her shoes...

06:58.085 --> 07:00.353
Then I will rule
The Emerald City...

07:00.387 --> 07:02.790
which I will
immediately dye pink!

07:02.823 --> 07:04.024
(giggles)

07:04.057 --> 07:04.858
(lightning cracks)

07:04.892 --> 07:06.560
(audience gasps)

07:06.594 --> 07:08.261
(applause)

07:08.295 --> 07:10.330
Weren't we supposed
to beat the witch?

07:10.363 --> 07:13.266
Have there been some
revisions I am unaware of?

07:13.300 --> 07:15.202
I for one am loving it!

07:15.235 --> 07:19.573
Oh... Well it does have a
theater of the absurd vibe...

07:19.607 --> 07:21.308
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.310
I got up to help
Mr. Jenneson,

07:23.343 --> 07:25.212
he needed directions
to the bathroom.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.080
I think he went
to throw up.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.218
(cackles)

07:32.953 --> 07:34.254
What was that all about?

07:34.287 --> 07:37.257
She's saying it's
over for me.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.226
Look...

07:39.259 --> 07:42.830
...from "Calico
Catfish and the Princess."

07:42.863 --> 07:44.297
My first musical here.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.432
It's not over yet!

07:45.465 --> 07:49.169
If we don't fix this, the
auditorium will be a pool!

07:49.202 --> 07:52.540
And my hair will
turn chlorine green!

07:52.573 --> 07:55.075
Maybe it's not so bad.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.944
Yes it is/ Absolutely horrible.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.446
I'm never going on stage again.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.515
Ever!

08:01.549 --> 08:03.584
Maybe we should
just call it a day.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.185
I mean, look at my work.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.620
You're just going
to give up?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.922
Because of one
bad performance?

08:08.956 --> 08:09.256
Yup.

08:09.289 --> 08:09.823
Yes.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.858
I'm allergic to straw.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.895
Think, Mellie.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.930
How can we fix this?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.398
*

08:18.431 --> 08:21.101
*

08:21.134 --> 08:24.004
As long as I'm Head of
Performing Arts at MacKendrick,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.372
the show will go on!

08:25.405 --> 08:27.007
Sun Hi: She can't
even talk!

08:27.040 --> 08:30.310
And even if she could, we
don't have another lion costume.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.013
Well, not in the
traditional sense.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.586
Corki, think!

08:38.619 --> 08:40.253
What gives you strength?

08:43.657 --> 08:45.926
Caleb, remember
that thing I told you?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.895
You shouldn't use
fireworks in the shower?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.396
No, the other thing.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.165
The "trust your
imagination!" speech.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.466
You never told me that...

08:53.500 --> 08:57.304
Well, I'm
telling you now.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.939
Maybe I wrote it wrong?

08:58.972 --> 09:02.442
If it came from inside
you, how could it be wrong?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.977
Trust yourself.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.080
Do you think Shakespeare
had this much trouble

09:07.114 --> 09:08.148
when he wrote Macbeth?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.049
What?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.017
You didn't!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.685
I heard... nothing.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.520
There is no curse.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.962
This will take
things up a notch...

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
We're going to
need a miracle.

09:24.097 --> 09:28.235
You may be correct, your theater
program could use some tweaks.

09:28.268 --> 09:32.072
Yeah. Just like my spine,
according to my chiropractor.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.108
Know what's good
for a bad back?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.577
Swimming.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.279
Chang pool.

09:39.613 --> 09:43.116
(applause)

09:44.084 --> 09:49.222
And now the conclusion
of "Hunting Dorothy".

09:49.256 --> 09:51.992
(applause)

09:52.025 --> 09:54.962
*

09:54.995 --> 09:57.230
Mr. Stark, go for it?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.532
Always, Sun Hi. Always.

09:59.566 --> 10:05.538
*

10:05.572 --> 10:07.607
Annnnd, curtain!

10:07.641 --> 10:17.651
(violin music)

10:17.685 --> 10:26.126
(violin music)

10:26.159 --> 10:28.395
(audience gasps)

10:28.428 --> 10:31.765
(roaring)

10:31.799 --> 10:34.601
* Let's come together,

10:34.634 --> 10:39.372
* We'll build it up
and make it better, *

10:39.406 --> 10:42.275
* When walls divide it,

10:42.309 --> 10:47.380
* We tear them down
become united, *

10:47.414 --> 10:51.218
* It's symptomatic
of automatic love, *

10:51.251 --> 10:54.221
* This could be our night,

10:54.254 --> 10:58.658
* For us to come alive,

10:58.692 --> 11:01.494
* It's time to show
them who we are, *

11:01.528 --> 11:02.730
* Who we are,

11:02.763 --> 11:09.202
*

11:09.236 --> 11:10.437
* Who we are,

11:10.470 --> 11:16.543
*

11:16.576 --> 11:18.045
* Who we are,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.146
(cheers)

11:19.179 --> 11:21.514
* So fascinating,

11:21.548 --> 11:26.219
* Our journey to our
destination, *

11:26.253 --> 11:28.688
* It's so amazing,

11:28.722 --> 11:34.261
* On this golden road
we're blazin', *

11:34.294 --> 11:38.098
* It's symptomatic
of automatic love, *

11:38.131 --> 11:40.768
* This could be our night,

11:40.801 --> 11:45.505
* For us to come alive,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.375
* It's time to show
them who we are, *

11:48.408 --> 11:49.843
* Who we are,

11:49.877 --> 11:55.816
* Oh, oh, oh,

11:55.849 --> 11:57.350
* Who we are,

11:57.384 --> 12:03.556
*

12:03.590 --> 12:06.159
* Who we are,

12:06.193 --> 12:08.528
* It's so amazing,

12:08.561 --> 12:13.100
* On this golden road
we're blazin', *

12:13.133 --> 12:16.169
* It's so amazing,

12:16.203 --> 12:18.571
* On this golden road
we're blazin', *

12:18.605 --> 12:20.173
* Who we are,

12:20.207 --> 12:20.673
*

12:20.707 --> 12:22.209
* Who we are,

12:22.242 --> 12:25.745
*

12:25.779 --> 12:27.547
* Who we are,

12:27.580 --> 12:33.420
*

12:33.453 --> 12:34.888
* Who we are,

12:34.922 --> 12:40.760
*

12:40.794 --> 12:43.563
* Who we are.

12:43.596 --> 12:53.573
(cheers and applause)

12:53.606 --> 13:02.482
*

13:02.515 --> 13:05.752
Show Dorothy to me, the
Wonderful Wizard of Oz!

13:05.785 --> 13:07.587
*

13:07.620 --> 13:08.021
(gasps)

13:08.055 --> 13:09.422
Jared Anderson?!

13:09.456 --> 13:10.423
Oh come on!

13:10.457 --> 13:13.593
It's Dennis, actually.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.528
I dropped a house on a witch.

13:15.562 --> 13:20.200
I wore some old troll costume
that smells like hot garbage,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.402
and now I'm wearing this dress.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.271
All for the Cowardly Lion!

13:24.304 --> 13:26.840
*

13:26.874 --> 13:27.640
Really?

13:27.674 --> 13:28.508
Really?!

13:28.541 --> 13:29.676
All: Really?

13:29.709 --> 13:34.514
You have all served Emerald
City well and I thank you.

13:34.547 --> 13:41.254
But what you seek is, and always
has been, inside of you.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.257
(applause)

13:44.291 --> 13:47.194
(cheers)

13:47.227 --> 13:51.731
(applause)

13:51.764 --> 13:52.532
Wow.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.967
We did it.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.702
They like us.

13:55.735 --> 13:56.937
It's not about us.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.771
(applause)

13:58.805 --> 14:02.575
Everyone, thank you so much!

14:02.609 --> 14:06.246
But there was someone else
who deserves the applause.

14:06.279 --> 14:10.918
He gave us the courage to
trust our hearts and minds.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.552
Mr. Melwood Stark.

14:12.585 --> 14:22.595
(applause)

14:22.629 --> 14:27.700
(applause)

14:27.734 --> 14:29.702
These aren't tears.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.639
I was making French
onion soup backstage.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.741
(scattered laughter)

14:34.774 --> 14:37.644
(applause)

14:38.411 --> 14:40.247
The felt so good!

14:43.883 --> 14:46.486
Oh. My. Gosh.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.288
Who designed the
costumes here?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.289
That would be me...

14:49.322 --> 14:50.890
You're Jodi Mapa?

14:50.924 --> 14:51.858
I'm Hye Jung--

14:51.891 --> 14:54.727
I know. Best designer ever.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.563
I've been trying
to track you down.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.266
We found this in
one of our trucks.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.867
Your designs are remarkable.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.470
Mr. Stark told me all
about you and this play.

15:03.503 --> 15:10.310
*

15:10.343 --> 15:13.680
I'm in need of a smart
designer for an internship.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.948
A smart designer.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.384
Oh. Okay, um...

15:17.417 --> 15:19.719
Wait! You're
talking about me.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.620
Yeah.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.823
I'm the smart designer.

15:23.856 --> 15:24.557
Yes!

15:24.591 --> 15:25.358
Okay!

15:25.392 --> 15:26.659
Thank you!

15:26.693 --> 15:31.364
*

15:31.398 --> 15:32.599
Did you like it?

15:32.632 --> 15:35.635
Unique, unexpected, thrilling.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.637
So brave to get out
there and perform.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.472
You think I'm brave?

15:39.506 --> 15:43.476
I was so afraid,
my mind went blank.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.080
Everybody's afraid of
something, but courage is not

15:47.114 --> 15:50.617
the absence of fear, it's
the ability to face it.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.986
And you are very
courageous, Corki.

15:53.020 --> 15:53.786
(laughs)

15:53.820 --> 15:55.388
*

15:55.422 --> 15:57.324
I'd like to donate
a new building.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.926
We could put your name on
the bottom of the pool.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.094
Everyone will see it.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.796
Chang Pool! Chang
Pool! Chang Pool!

16:03.830 --> 16:04.631
No.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.565
What??

16:05.598 --> 16:06.599
I hate pools.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.367
Why?!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.436
The Stark
"Theater Arts Building".

16:09.469 --> 16:11.904
If Mr. Stark agrees to
stay on as Artistic Director.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.374
Nooooo!!!

16:14.407 --> 16:15.808
Ouch.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.510
I'll have to think about it.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.911
It's a big check.

16:18.945 --> 16:19.612
I'm in.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.715
*

16:22.749 --> 16:24.417
(excited gurgling)

16:24.451 --> 16:26.553
(laughter)

16:26.586 --> 16:28.021
You did this.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.689
It was nothing.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.391
It was everything.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.893
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.762
You opened your heart to me.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.065
Guys!! I have a heart!

16:38.098 --> 16:39.132
(audience clamouring)

16:39.166 --> 16:40.833
Is that... more applause?

16:40.867 --> 16:43.136
The highest praise an
audience can give!

16:43.170 --> 16:44.737
(applause)

16:44.771 --> 16:46.005
An encore!

16:46.039 --> 16:48.675
Well, let's
get out there!

16:48.708 --> 16:49.509
(snapping)

16:49.542 --> 16:50.577
(shrieks)

16:50.610 --> 16:52.145
(CRASH!!!)

16:52.179 --> 16:53.646
(gasps)

16:53.680 --> 16:56.083
All: The curse
of MacBeth!!!!!

16:57.417 --> 16:57.784
Everybody run!!

16:57.817 --> 16:58.885
Wait!

16:58.918 --> 17:01.821
I'm not not doing
our first encore.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.391
It'll break my heart.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.892
And I just got it.

17:05.925 --> 17:09.129
Everyone, calm
down, don't worry.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.531
There was a minor
technical issue.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.932
But there will be an encore.

17:12.965 --> 17:13.766
Follow me.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.469
Hey Club Ry Ri!

17:16.503 --> 17:18.438
We're XO-IQ!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.073

17:20.107 --> 17:27.580

17:27.614 --> 17:29.849

18:45.225 --> 18:48.595
* Now do you feel the love,

18:48.628 --> 18:52.865

Audience: XO-IQ!
XO-IQ! XO-IQ!

19:56.729 --> 19:57.597
The dresses worked!

19:57.630 --> 20:00.667
Caleb: You guys
are awesome.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.601
Great job guys!

20:01.634 --> 20:02.835
Maybe you need a raise.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.970
Have we met before?

20:04.003 --> 20:05.004
It's me.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.172
Your boss.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.340
Randy.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.775
Randy!?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.077
Wait, so you're
not a shadow?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.145
A friend of mine
wants to meet you.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.047
Hey Nick!

20:15.081 --> 20:17.083
Wassup.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.751
Wait-- You're--

20:18.785 --> 20:20.687
You're Nick Cannon!

20:21.821 --> 20:23.155
Does he always do that?

20:23.189 --> 20:24.023
Pretty much.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.258
Sometimes he throws up.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.593
Oh... well.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.094
Randy always let
me know when

20:28.127 --> 20:29.629
something special
rolls through,

20:29.662 --> 20:32.064
and you ladies are
definitely something special.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.866

20:33.900 --> 20:34.801
Stunned selfie!

20:34.834 --> 20:37.704
(camera shutter)

20:37.737 --> 20:40.973
Hey, I'm thinkin I want you
guys to go on tour with me.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.676
I'm talkin thirty
dates, thirty cities.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.379
O-M-G.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.214
I'm sorry,
I can't.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.349
I have an
internship.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.117
Jodi! Let's talk
about this--

20:51.150 --> 20:52.752
--There's nothing
to talk about.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.622
I didn't send you to MacKendrick
to abandon your education.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.657
Corki, you're coming home.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.692
(protests)

21:01.861 --> 21:04.163
And I'm retracting my donation.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.899
But, but, Mr. Chang!

21:06.933 --> 21:10.102
It seems like your band has
some stuff to sort out...

21:10.136 --> 21:11.871
Call me when you do.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.375
*

21:15.408 --> 21:17.109
Wha-- wha--
what happened?

21:17.143 --> 21:18.345
Where's Nick Cannon?

21:18.378 --> 21:19.879
We need to talk.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.852

21:25.885 --> 21:27.086

21:27.119 --> 21:29.889
(wailing shrieks)

21:29.922 --> 21:32.725
*

21:32.759 --> 21:33.760
(shrieking continues)
