WEBVTT

01:13.741 --> 01:15.117
Drew.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.495
Where do you think you're going?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.622
I got a life
outside the store, you know.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.705
Besides, my shift's over.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.833
That's your regular shift.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.377
You still got overtime to do.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.628
Overtime?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.964
Oh, come on, Warren, not again.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.382
The store's practically empty.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.342
Other kids beg for overtime.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.094
Maybe I should hire one of them.

01:45.648 --> 01:47.650
Sorry, hon. We're all out of your size.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.738
Hey, you can't just come...

02:01.789 --> 02:03.249
All right, it's yours.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.627
All of it!

02:19.390 --> 02:21.309
Stay here. You'll be safe.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.657
Why are you doing this to me?

02:36.741 --> 02:39.410
'Cause you don't
respect the kids who work for you.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.037
That's it?

02:41.120 --> 02:42.413
Because of some loser kids?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.748
You gotta be crazy!

02:46.917 --> 02:48.419
Like I had to say it.

02:51.005 --> 02:54.050
Look, look, I'm sorry, okay?

02:54.133 --> 02:55.843
- I'm sorry!
- Too late.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.929
You should have
respected the people you didn't fear.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.479
- Batman?
- Payback, right?

03:06.562 --> 03:09.732
- Yeah, your new ally.
- Ally?

03:09.815 --> 03:13.235
- What are you talking about?
- I do the same thing you do.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.987
Sorry, pal, not even close.

03:24.997 --> 03:28.167
If you're not with me,
then you're the enemy, too!

03:51.065 --> 03:51.899
Whoa.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.234
I want one.

03:59.865 --> 04:00.865
Aah!

04:13.838 --> 04:15.172
Look at this place.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.591
You couldn't fight the guy outside?

04:24.557 --> 04:26.451
This Payback guy thinks
he's some sort of vigilante

04:26.475 --> 04:28.018
standing up for kids.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.438
The good news is,
I finally met him face to face.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.857
<i>But the bad news is,
you didn't stop him.</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:35.860
I couldn't. I had the manager
and Drew to worry about.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.903
- <i>Drew?</i>
- He's a kid from my school.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.029
<i>Really?</i>

04:46.579 --> 04:50.124
Another student at your school
was also connected to Payback.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.251
The son of the man
who was attacked last week,

04:52.334 --> 04:54.462
and the two boys
have something else in common.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.465
They're both patients
at the Gotham Youth Counseling Center.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.675
- Know anything about it?
- What's there to know?

04:59.758 --> 05:02.261
Sometimes people just need a place
to talk out their problems.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.931
Some people, anyway.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.058
Is anyone else from the center
connected to Payback?

05:08.142 --> 05:10.561
I don't know.
I can't get into their computer.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.770
It's not on the net.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.856
Great. So much for that lead.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.651
You know, we did do detective work
before there was a net.

05:22.615 --> 05:24.408
He hasn't called me in a week.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.692
You're better off without him.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.119
How can you say that?

05:27.203 --> 05:29.288
DuWayne cheated on you, Trina.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.582
- Lied to you, too.
- DuWayne loves me.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.791
Will you say something?

05:32.958 --> 05:36.420
How about we let Trina
work things out at her own speed?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.881
Now, before time runs out,
we have a new member to meet.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.049
Terry McGinnis.

05:40.716 --> 05:41.550
Hey.

05:41.634 --> 05:42.801
- How ya doin'?
- Hi.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.605
Terry, why don't you tell us
about yourself?

05:44.803 --> 05:45.803
Uh...

05:45.846 --> 05:47.556
What do you wanna know, Dr. Stanton?

05:47.640 --> 05:49.433
Well, for starters,

05:49.517 --> 05:51.810
- what brings you here?
- Nothin' special.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.313
So everything's perfect in your life?

05:54.396 --> 05:56.036
Maybe you don't belong here
at the center.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.192
- No, no, I do, really.
- What's your problem then?

05:58.275 --> 06:00.319
I guess you could say
my problem's not a "what."

06:00.402 --> 06:01.946
It's a "who."

06:03.989 --> 06:06.700
It sounds to me
like Mr. Wayne really does respect you

06:06.784 --> 06:08.744
but that he has a hard time showing it.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.204
Why do you think that is?

06:10.287 --> 06:13.040
Maybe some trauma in his past.
I don't know.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.459
But if he keeps
getting on your nerves, quit.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.877
It's only an after-school job.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.587
Actually, it's a little more than that.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.506
Whoa! Close one!

06:23.217 --> 06:25.052
So you got your own virtual arcade, huh?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.971
This is just one of Howard's hobbies.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.889
He does all our video work.

06:28.973 --> 06:30.133
He's pretty much of a genius.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.476
And here's the other resident genius,

06:32.560 --> 06:33.769
my son, Kenny.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.397
Dad, you wanna play?

06:36.480 --> 06:39.483
Can't right now, but say hello
to Terry McGinnis. He's new here.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.568
Hi-

06:41.235 --> 06:43.195
And this is Howard Lewis, Terry.

06:43.279 --> 06:46.115
- McGinnis.
- Maybe we can play tonight?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.117
- Or go to a movie?
- I'd love to, but...

06:48.200 --> 06:51.161
But you gotta work late.
You always say that.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.539
Kenny, there are so many kids
with problems

06:53.622 --> 06:55.624
big problems,
I wouldn't be much of a doctor

06:55.708 --> 06:57.352
if I didn't do everything
I could to help them.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.421
Dr. Stanton, there's a young lady
down in reception,

07:00.504 --> 07:02.047
says she needs to see you right away,

07:02.131 --> 07:03.465
an emergency.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.926
- Did you get her name?
- Maxine Gibson.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.178
Oh, she's not a patient,
but if it's an emergency...

07:08.262 --> 07:09.930
You'll have to see yourself out, Terry.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.121
Max's timing was perfect.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.564
I'm in Stanton's office right now.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.172
I'm starting the download.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.150
Welcome back.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.904
What happened?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.322
Looks like you fainted.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.115
Anything like this ever happen before?

08:11.075 --> 08:12.409
Howard found you on the floor.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.412
- I was looking for Dr. S.
- Lucky for me.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.916
Terry, one thing.
What were you doing in here?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.377
I was coming down the hall
and I started to feel dizzy.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.212
I figured there'd be a couch in here.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.506
- Dizzy, huh?
- First dayjitters, maybe?

08:26.632 --> 08:27.841
Maybe.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.014
OW!

08:34.098 --> 08:35.849
Why weren't you watching your back?

08:35.933 --> 08:38.102
I was too busy watching my front!

08:38.185 --> 08:39.496
Am I supposed to have eyes everywhere?

08:39.520 --> 08:42.064
Only if you want to live
to a ripe old age.

08:42.147 --> 08:45.275
You don't make it sound too inviting.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.986
I severed the computer link
when I lost contact with you.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.323
- Did you get all the files?
- Uh-huh.

08:51.407 --> 08:54.993
And every one of Payback's attacks
is linked to kids at the center.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.913
Each victim was
a patient's parent, teacher, boss.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.374
The people kids gripe about.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.686
So Payback's attacking
whoever gets ratted on in that room.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.546
But these patients
aren't all in one group.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.716
So our suspect has to be someone
who has access to every session.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.552
I'm so ahead of you.
Bring up a guy named Howard Lewis.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.721
The center keeps
vid-disks of the sessions

09:13.804 --> 09:16.223
and this guy's the librarian.
He's got the access.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.184
- But what about a motive?
- He acts like a kid himself.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.704
Maybe he's decided
to be their protector.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.856
Why rule out Dr. Stanton?
He's got access, too.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.858
You taught me to follow my gut.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.945
Be careful, your gut's still young.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.290
It looks like Lewis is the one

09:41.373 --> 09:43.333
who made those creepy sculptures
at the center.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.419
<i>Well, that should be enough
for a conviction.</i>

09:48.672 --> 09:49.923
He's got the laser, too.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.342
<i>Even still warm.</i>

09:52.676 --> 09:53.676
Now do you believe me?

10:26.335 --> 10:27.920
It's over, Payback.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.339
- Who?
- Don't bother.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.466
I've seen that laser
close enough to singe my suit.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.967
The laser?

10:34.051 --> 10:36.470
I cut my sculptures with it, that's all.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.223
- Save it for the cops.
<i>- Terry, stop.</i>

10:39.306 --> 10:41.391
What? Don't tell me you're buying this.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.686
He's telling the truth.
Is there a vid-screen around there?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.190
- Yeah, but-
- Tum it on, any channel.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.157
Payback?

10:59.409 --> 11:00.409
Um...

11:00.619 --> 11:01.620
Sorry?

11:53.589 --> 11:55.007
DuWayne, do something!

11:56.174 --> 11:59.094
Yeah, DuWayne,
protect your girlfriend.

11:59.177 --> 12:02.055
Or do you care as little about her
as you did the last one?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.588
I know what you're doing,
and you're nuts!

13:16.672 --> 13:18.672
You think those kids
want you to hurt these people?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.515
You don't know anything about kids.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.266
I know how kids think!

14:39.796 --> 14:41.256
This time
Payback was after a kid

14:41.339 --> 14:43.550
who was two-timing
one of the girls in the group.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.885
He got away again.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.344
You might've gotten there in time

14:46.428 --> 14:48.346
if you hadn'tjumped the gun with Lewis.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.807
- I know.
- Do you?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.852
You injured an innocent man.
That's inexcusable!

14:53.935 --> 14:55.812
And I'm sorry, okay?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.874
But I got something
more important to do right now.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.567
- And what might that be?
- Stanton.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.819
If Payback's not Lewis,
Stanton's gotta be the one.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.197
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.991
but from now on,
we're handling it my way,

15:08.075 --> 15:10.952
which means, taking our time
and getting it right.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.708
<i>He 's never satisfied
with anything I do.</i>

15:16.792 --> 15:19.062
It... It's like he thinks
he's the only one in the whole world

15:19.086 --> 15:20.504
who could ever do this job right.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.149
Just feel like I'm
never gonna be good enough for him.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.893
<i>Terry, why don't you
“fit find another 30's?</i>

15:24.966 --> 15:26.009
That'd be too easy.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.637
He should confront the old man tonight.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.263
You're probably right,

15:30.347 --> 15:32.700
except tonight he's gonna be
at that big party at the new hotel.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.393
No excuses, Terry, you can't put it off.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.538
Hey, maybe if he gets away
from that house for a night,

15:37.562 --> 15:38.855
it'll mellow him out a little.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.607
That old guy?
From what you've told us,

15:40.690 --> 15:42.734
he'll never mellow out.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.194
You don't know the half.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.907
Look, I don't wanna
talk about this anymore, okay?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.784
<i>Gotham's elite
are gathering tonight</i>

15:50.867 --> 15:52.244
<i>to celebrate the opening</i>

15:52.327 --> 15:55.288
<i>of the spectacular
new Vreeland Marquis Hotel.</i>

15:55.372 --> 15:58.208
<i>Prominent on the guest list
is billionaire Bruce Wayne,</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:00.418
<i>a longtime friend
of the Vreeland family,</i>

16:00.502 --> 16:02.254
<i>who will be making
a rare public appearance.</i>

16:42.002 --> 16:45.505
I'm here for him.
The rest of you can go.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.557
You're a mean, old man, you know that?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.726
Mmm-hmm. And what are you?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.227
Your worst nightmare.

17:01.146 --> 17:04.232
You have no idea
what my nightmares are like.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.366
- You okay?
- What kept you?

17:54.449 --> 17:56.769
I figured he'd at least wait
till after the hors d'oeuvres.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.628
It's Stanton's son.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.304
He was always hanging around with Lewis.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.987
And he had access to the vid-disks, too.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.152
This is all my fault.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.447
I was always so busy,
I kept dumping him on Lewis.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.033
He must've thought
if he solved my patients' problems,

20:00.116 --> 20:01.618
I'd have more time for him.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.828
- I'm so sorry.
- Go to your son.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.460
You called it.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.921
I put down the bait like you said,
and Payback took it.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.923
Only it wasn't
who I thought it would be.

20:15.006 --> 20:18.051
- I was wrong, twice.
- Learn from it.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.511
That's all you can do.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.555
By the way,
exactly what did you say in that group

20:22.639 --> 20:24.432
to get Payback so mad at me?

20:24.516 --> 20:26.643
You must've given
quite a convincing performance.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.021
Who said anything about performing?
