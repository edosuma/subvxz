WEBVTT

00:01.813 --> 00:04.030
Okay, I need two volunteers.

00:04.030 --> 00:05.964
Oh, right here, I'm first! Pick me!

00:06.033 --> 00:09.568
Okay, thank you, Mateo. Who else?

00:09.603 --> 00:10.702
Anyone?

00:12.739 --> 00:13.805
Garrett!

00:13.874 --> 00:15.541
Yeah, I just wanted to say no.

00:15.576 --> 00:16.908
You're all ingrates.

00:16.944 --> 00:18.577
I hope someone sets you all on fire,

00:18.612 --> 00:20.078
and you need a volunteer to put it out.

00:20.113 --> 00:21.580
It's too much for 6:00 a.m., Dina.

00:21.615 --> 00:22.647
I don't think it's enough.

00:22.716 --> 00:24.415
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

00:24.451 --> 00:26.650
Okay, thank you, Jonah.

00:26.650 --> 00:28.350
You and Mateo will be in charge

00:28.385 --> 00:31.475
of our in-store dog adoption today.

00:32.174 --> 00:33.142
Yes, that's right.

00:33.143 --> 00:35.476
That volunteer job was desirable.

00:35.512 --> 00:37.087
That was a lesson.

00:37.088 --> 00:41.123
"And lo, the Samaritan,
as he traveled, came to where..."

00:41.124 --> 00:42.423
6:00 a.m., Glenn.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.436
Okay, right.

00:43.437 --> 00:46.471
Anyway, while the rest of you
are having normal, dogless days,

00:47.081 --> 00:50.615
these two selfless heroes
will be in puppy heaven.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.584
I want to be in puppy heaven.

00:52.619 --> 00:53.752
I'll switch if anybody wants.

00:53.787 --> 00:54.920
I don't really care about dogs.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.721
What?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.723
- What did he say?
- I mean, I don't dislike them.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.692
I just, you know, I don't
really have strong feelings

01:00.727 --> 01:02.928
- one way or the other.
- You're a psychopath.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.729
Sociopath, he's a sociopath.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.431
Is it because they don't like you?

01:06.466 --> 01:10.468
No, no I think it says
something about our priorities

01:10.537 --> 01:12.736
that we spend so much money on pets

01:12.772 --> 01:14.972
when there are literally
millions of children

01:15.041 --> 01:17.641
without adequate nutrition.

01:17.710 --> 01:18.642
I hope you die.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.579
Okay, I need another volunteer.

01:21.614 --> 01:22.780
Me me me me me me me me!

01:22.815 --> 01:24.782
Sandra, thank you.

01:24.817 --> 01:25.916
Come on up.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.452
And I am glad that
you're an animal lover

01:28.487 --> 01:31.538
because we have a large
number of hornets nests

01:31.539 --> 01:33.106
around the perimeter of the store.

01:33.141 --> 01:37.076
That's right, it's not always
good to volunteer.

01:37.112 --> 01:38.990
That was another lesson.

01:43.861 --> 01:46.028
No, look, I want the sour
cream and onion chips.

01:46.063 --> 01:48.497
I can't eat the ones
with the ridges on them

01:48.532 --> 01:49.999
because they hurt the top of my mouth!

01:50.034 --> 01:51.867
That's part of the experience, Cheyenne.

01:51.902 --> 01:54.703
I feel like I don't even
know who you are anymore.

01:54.738 --> 01:56.571
Hey hey, what is happening?

01:56.640 --> 01:58.740
I don't even know who Bo is anymore.

01:58.809 --> 02:00.008
- Okay, all right.
- Are you kidding me?

02:00.043 --> 02:01.510
You know that's because
I never get what I want.

02:01.545 --> 02:03.912
All I ever do now is babysit for free!

02:03.981 --> 02:07.849
It's not babysitting
when you're the dad!

02:07.885 --> 02:09.083
- Whoa!
- Hey, guys, chill.

02:09.151 --> 02:10.519
No, come on.

02:10.554 --> 02:13.687
This doesn't have to wind up on YouTube.

02:13.723 --> 02:15.723
Film one of my impressions instead.

02:15.758 --> 02:16.991
Okay, you want to start something now?

02:17.027 --> 02:19.060
- Yeah!
- "Hi, I'm Batman."

02:19.095 --> 02:20.395
That was Batman.

02:20.430 --> 02:23.531
"And now I'm the Joker."

02:23.566 --> 02:25.033
Somebody has to clean all of this up.

02:25.068 --> 02:30.871
"You merely adopted the dark,
I was born in it."

02:30.907 --> 02:34.374
Damn, tight Bane! Respect.

02:34.410 --> 02:35.676
Thank you.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074

02:47.089 --> 02:49.756
I know we've always
had this unspoken rivalry.

02:49.791 --> 02:52.263
Not a rivalry, you're just
always mean to me.

02:52.436 --> 02:56.205
And not unspoken, you talk
about it all the time?

02:56.240 --> 02:57.943
Well, anyway, since
we're stuck together,

02:57.943 --> 02:59.376
I figured we could at least be civil.

02:59.411 --> 03:01.878
Okay, somebody needs
to be in charge of the...

03:01.913 --> 03:03.046
I'll do it. I'll do it better.

03:03.081 --> 03:04.580
This guy doesn't even like dogs so.

03:04.616 --> 03:05.915
See, you're even trying to embarrass me

03:05.951 --> 03:07.050
in front of the dog lady.

03:07.085 --> 03:10.319
"Dog lady?" Jonah, she has a name.

03:13.091 --> 03:14.991
- Lydia.
- Lydia.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.726
Really, Lydia?

03:16.762 --> 03:18.227
- Yeah.
- Ouch.

03:18.263 --> 03:21.096
Attention shoppers, are you
thinking of having a baby,

03:21.132 --> 03:22.298
but want to test the waters

03:22.333 --> 03:24.166
with something that's
not the same at all?

03:24.235 --> 03:25.901
Adopt a dog today.

03:25.936 --> 03:28.003
Hey, you forgot to
clock in this morning.

03:28.072 --> 03:31.006
Oh, yeah, I came in behind
Elias and got distracted.

03:31.075 --> 03:32.608
What's going on with his butt?

03:32.644 --> 03:33.743
Make sure to clock in at some point

03:33.778 --> 03:34.843
so we can start paying you.

03:34.912 --> 03:36.178
Oh, hold up. Wait.

03:36.247 --> 03:37.746
I haven't been paid
for the last two hours?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.848
Can't you just adjust the timesheet?

03:39.917 --> 03:41.616
Can. Won't.

03:41.652 --> 03:42.951
Rules are rules.

03:42.987 --> 03:44.119
Are you being serious?

03:44.155 --> 03:45.400
Yeah, I'm being serious,

03:45.401 --> 03:48.435
and "what's up" with Elias's
butt is he started cycling.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.736
Obviously.

03:51.806 --> 03:52.939
Sh...

03:53.400 --> 03:56.167
I feel like all we ever do now is fight.

03:56.202 --> 03:58.035
We used to have so much fun.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.237
We would talk about everything.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.507
Movies, music, politics...

04:02.542 --> 04:05.243
- Politics, really?
- Mm-hmm.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.879
But now, I mean, we're
supposed to get married

04:07.914 --> 04:11.916
in a few months,
and I'm starting to think

04:11.951 --> 04:13.918
maybe we should move that up.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.853
- Wait, what?
- Oh good, a wedding!

04:16.890 --> 04:18.389
Because then we'll be newlyweds

04:18.423 --> 04:19.523
and we won't fight anymore.

04:19.558 --> 04:20.892
Fine by me.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.059
Just get it over with.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.227
Not on Tuesday, though.
I got my DJ class.

04:24.263 --> 04:25.462
I can call my church and see

04:25.531 --> 04:27.097
if they have an opening next week.

04:27.132 --> 04:30.233
Oh, and I get points
in the gift shop for referrals.

04:30.269 --> 04:34.471
- No, Glenn, wait...
- Customer service, thank you.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.241
Guys, getting married is not
gonna solve all these problems.

04:38.277 --> 04:40.110
Yes, there is a honeymoon period...

04:40.145 --> 04:43.079
Honeymoon period. Banging everywhere.

04:43.115 --> 04:44.381
Mmm. Mmm.

04:44.416 --> 04:47.817
Yeah, and all that banging
builds a foundation

04:47.886 --> 04:51.288
of love and trust that lasts forever.

04:51.323 --> 04:53.423
No, marriage is hard.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.593
It's a big deal.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.953
It's gonna be one of the
hardest things you ever do.

04:56.954 --> 04:59.254
It's not something
you just want to rush into.

04:59.297 --> 05:00.274
Okay, hang on.

05:00.275 --> 05:02.841
Do you guys want a black
choir or a white choir?

05:02.878 --> 05:04.878
- Black choir.
- Definitely black choir.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.946
I mean, I'm not really
on board with this whole...

05:07.015 --> 05:08.882
Yes, a black choir, of course.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.417
We'll take Lucius and
the Gang, thank you.

05:12.139 --> 05:14.406
All right, I think you guys are all set.

05:14.457 --> 05:16.435
So I'll be back at 6:00 to close down

05:16.435 --> 05:18.469
and take the dogs that don't get
adopted back to the shelter.

05:18.504 --> 05:19.937
Oh, these guys aren't going back.

05:19.972 --> 05:21.472
I'm gonna get them all adopted.

05:21.507 --> 05:25.008
You might as well find new dogs
at the junkyard or wherever.

05:25.043 --> 05:27.811
Honestly, most of them
probably won't get adopted.

05:27.847 --> 05:29.645
But even one life saved
makes it all worth it.

05:29.681 --> 05:31.514
Wait, "one life saved"?

05:31.549 --> 05:33.049
Yeah, we're an open admissions shelter,

05:33.118 --> 05:35.618
meaning we do have to euthanize
based on duration of stay.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.854
So unfortunately, most of these
guys, they're out of time.

05:37.889 --> 05:40.357
- Oh, my God.
- That's terrible.

05:40.392 --> 05:42.625
Oh... oh, God no,
that's not what I meant.

05:42.660 --> 05:43.826
No, no, no.

05:43.862 --> 05:45.862
- Oh, okay.
- You won't have to kill them.

05:45.897 --> 05:47.964
We have a service that comes in.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.326
I'm dating the injection guy.

05:50.362 --> 05:51.628
Yeah, he's great.

05:51.663 --> 05:55.165
He's divorced. Most of
them are at my age, so.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.666
Yeah. Do you sell stamps?

05:56.701 --> 05:58.535
- At the register.
- Yeah, okay.

05:58.570 --> 06:00.736
I'm gonna just... excuse me.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.995
Oh, and dryer sheets, actually?

06:04.030 --> 06:07.332
- Aisle 12.
- 12, 12. Thank you.

06:13.564 --> 06:15.564
I don't know why they bother
calling it a shelter.

06:15.565 --> 06:19.166
They should just call it
Doggie Death Row.

06:19.451 --> 06:20.918
I don't know why you're so upset.

06:20.953 --> 06:22.947
I thought you'd be
jumping for joy by now.

06:22.948 --> 06:24.915
"Yay! Dead dogs! It's Jonah Christmas!"

06:24.950 --> 06:27.751
Look, we only have until 6:00 p.m.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.286
to get all of these dogs homes.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.455
And the only way that we're
gonna do that is by working to...

06:31.490 --> 06:33.290
We've got to work together.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.858
We got to work together
if we're gonna do this.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.361
- You up for that?
- Yes, it's a great idea.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.995
Great, we'll do my plan.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.801
- Just step over the...
- Okay.

06:46.635 --> 06:49.002
Do you ever regret getting
married so young?

06:49.037 --> 06:52.539
Um, no.

06:52.608 --> 06:55.541
I mean, I wouldn't say regret,

06:55.625 --> 07:01.197
but I did miss out on some
experiences and stuff.

07:01.198 --> 07:02.865
Yeah, like threesomes.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.368
- No, I didn't mean...
- Like sex with Italian guys?

07:06.403 --> 07:08.203
More like Nordic.

07:08.239 --> 07:13.466
But I didn't mean sex,
I meant life and dating

07:13.536 --> 07:15.277
and, you know, stuff like that.

07:15.312 --> 07:16.878
Yeah.

07:16.913 --> 07:19.046
Like, how do I know that Bo's the one?

07:19.082 --> 07:21.949
I mean, my friends
all thought I was crazy

07:21.985 --> 07:23.951
to go out with Bo when Cole liked me.

07:23.987 --> 07:25.119
Who's Cole?

07:25.155 --> 07:26.120
This guy at my school.

07:26.156 --> 07:28.055
He's like the anti-Bo.

07:28.091 --> 07:31.993
He's like always reading,
mature, really sweet.

07:32.061 --> 07:34.095
So why did you pick Bo?

07:34.130 --> 07:36.297
Cause Bo's wild.

07:36.332 --> 07:39.300
He used to smash bang-snaps
on his forehead.

07:39.335 --> 07:41.102
Cole would never do that.

07:41.137 --> 07:45.172
He was too busy tutoring or,
you know, doing debate team.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.440
Wow.

07:46.475 --> 07:49.246
This Cole guy sounds kind of great.

07:49.246 --> 07:53.715
I mean, it's nice to kind of
explore your options.

07:53.750 --> 07:57.052
Even though it's probably
too late now, right?

07:57.088 --> 07:58.720
Right.

07:58.755 --> 08:00.021
Right.

08:00.057 --> 08:01.222
Right.

08:01.257 --> 08:03.558
Right.

08:03.594 --> 08:06.194
What are we doing?

08:06.229 --> 08:08.196
Look, Cheyenne,

08:08.231 --> 08:10.765
I just want you to do what's
gonna make you happy.

08:10.801 --> 08:14.769
You know, whether that's being
with a sweet, responsible guy

08:14.805 --> 08:17.205
who likes books and helping people,

08:17.240 --> 08:20.708
or whether that's Bo
who's a wannabe rapper,

08:20.743 --> 08:23.277
who's saving up for a gold tooth.

08:23.313 --> 08:25.779
I trust you to make the right decision.

08:25.815 --> 08:27.215
Thanks, Amy.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.782
You're welcome.

08:28.818 --> 08:31.752
You're so old and wise.

08:31.787 --> 08:33.087
Okay.

08:35.957 --> 08:39.592
44, 43, 42...

08:39.629 --> 08:40.828
What are you doing?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.962
"Employees may take no
longer than 15 minutes

08:42.999 --> 08:43.974
for their lunch break."

08:43.975 --> 08:45.940
I've been timing you
since you walked in.

08:45.976 --> 08:47.799
You got 40 seconds left.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.599
Come on, I needed
to re-tighten my ponytail.

08:49.635 --> 08:51.000
I can't go out there
looking like a slut.

08:51.036 --> 08:53.036
Rules are rules, that's what you said.

08:53.104 --> 08:55.638
Unless you want to go back on that?

08:55.673 --> 09:00.710
35, 34, 33...

09:00.778 --> 09:01.978
32...

09:02.013 --> 09:04.780
Oh, it's so hot. It's burning my mouth.

09:04.816 --> 09:06.615
Less talking, more swallowing.

09:06.651 --> 09:08.283
God, my mouth skin.

09:08.319 --> 09:10.018
Hey, Bo.

09:10.054 --> 09:11.887
Now I don't want to sway you,

09:11.956 --> 09:14.690
but my church is offering
a nuptials package.

09:14.733 --> 09:18.968
It includes a future baptism at
half-price, no blackout dates.

09:18.996 --> 09:19.757
Yeah, I don't know.

09:19.757 --> 09:21.768
Maybe jumping into this
is, like, a mistake.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.067
- Oh.
- It's not like getting married

09:23.101 --> 09:24.734
is gonna suddenly fix everything.

09:24.769 --> 09:26.736
We're still gonna be
fighting all the time,

09:26.771 --> 09:29.872
all cramped up in Cheyenne's
mom's basement with the baby.

09:29.908 --> 09:33.910
Well, you know, maybe
that's the problem.

09:33.946 --> 09:35.745
You're all cooped up.

09:35.780 --> 09:37.780
You're like one of those
chickens in the tiny cages

09:37.816 --> 09:39.715
that can't turn around.

09:39.751 --> 09:42.552
It makes them crazy,
and then they taste different.

09:42.587 --> 09:44.386
The [Bleep] you talking about?

09:44.422 --> 09:47.890
Look, a married couple
needs their own place.

09:47.926 --> 09:51.727
My friend Kathy from church,
she's a real estate lady.

09:51.763 --> 09:55.064
No, wait, Glenn, darn it. It's 2016.

09:55.099 --> 09:56.999
She's a real estate man.

09:57.068 --> 09:59.468
I'm so sorry to hear
that your husband passed.

09:59.503 --> 10:01.437
What was his name?

10:01.472 --> 10:02.904
- Jeremy.
- Jeremy.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.840
And how long ago did he leave us?

10:04.908 --> 10:06.075
Two years ago.

10:06.110 --> 10:08.010
Oh, bless his soul.

10:08.079 --> 10:09.144
Tell me more about him.

10:09.828 --> 10:12.561
He loved camping,
and the outdoors and...

10:12.597 --> 10:13.445
Hey!

10:13.446 --> 10:15.846
Hold on, Mateo, she's in
the middle of a lovely story.

10:15.914 --> 10:18.448
No, I found Jeremy in the
camping section again.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.416
This dog's name is Jeremy?

10:20.452 --> 10:22.586
Yep, little 2-year-old Jeremy.

10:22.621 --> 10:23.653
That's so crazy.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.756
You and I... You don't think...

10:26.792 --> 10:28.592
Jeremy?

10:28.627 --> 10:31.760
Are you in there?

10:31.796 --> 10:34.663
The carpets were all replaced last year.

10:34.699 --> 10:36.966
And there's a washer/dryer
right behind the kitchen.

10:37.002 --> 10:38.968
Oh, wow.

10:39.004 --> 10:40.503
Oh, yeah.

10:40.538 --> 10:42.771
You know, I was hoping for
one of those double staircases

10:42.807 --> 10:44.107
that meet at the top.

10:44.142 --> 10:46.008
You got any houses with
double staircases, Kathy?

10:46.043 --> 10:48.143
Kind of like a built-in fish tank,

10:48.178 --> 10:49.712
big enough for, like, a little shark?

10:49.780 --> 10:51.814
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:51.849 --> 10:54.717
But wait, look at this kitchen.

10:54.785 --> 10:56.619
So while you're cooking you could just

10:56.654 --> 11:00.789
put on some Motown and groove on, baby.

11:00.825 --> 11:01.991
Yeah, you know what.

11:02.026 --> 11:03.525
Actually, I'm seeing a lot of

11:03.560 --> 11:05.027
pretty good bang spaces around here.

11:05.062 --> 11:08.630
Got this countertop, this
nice little window zone here,

11:08.665 --> 11:10.865
and what's up, these floors
are like made for it, right?

11:10.901 --> 11:15.003
Yeah, but it's also great for a family.

11:15.039 --> 11:17.739
What do you think?

11:17.807 --> 11:20.742
Throw in that dope brooch,
you've got a deal.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.010
No.

11:22.045 --> 11:24.879
Psych, I don't want
your ugly-ass brooch.

11:24.915 --> 11:26.147
I'll take the place.

11:26.182 --> 11:28.016
Wonderful. Great.

11:28.051 --> 11:29.584
Yes, I'm thrilled.

11:29.653 --> 11:32.854
Glenn, I assume you're cosigning.

11:32.889 --> 11:33.988
Cosigning?

11:34.024 --> 11:36.590
Wait, like I'd be responsible for...

11:36.659 --> 11:38.992
Yes, in case he can't pay
or there's damage.

11:45.334 --> 11:47.535
I texted Cole.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.036
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

11:49.072 --> 11:50.671
And he came over right away.

11:50.706 --> 11:52.272
He's right over there.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.875
Oh, wow, he's cute.

11:54.910 --> 11:56.944
I know, right?

11:57.012 --> 11:58.011
Do you want to meet him?

11:58.047 --> 11:59.613
Sure.

11:59.682 --> 12:02.015
Hey, Cole!

12:02.051 --> 12:04.217
Come over here!

12:04.252 --> 12:06.753
Okay, just be cool.

12:09.657 --> 12:11.657
So Cole, um...

12:11.658 --> 12:14.960
Cheyenne says she knows you from school?

12:14.996 --> 12:16.395
Sophomore English.

12:16.463 --> 12:20.565
Oh, okay, but, so...

12:20.634 --> 12:22.567
- You were her teacher.
- I was her teacher.

12:22.636 --> 12:25.637
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- That's, uh, so...

12:25.672 --> 12:27.372
Don't worry, nothing happened back then.

12:27.408 --> 12:29.974
I read the laws very carefully.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.510
Oh, good.

12:31.545 --> 12:34.212
He's so romantic.

12:34.247 --> 12:36.480
I don't want to make
a big deal out of it,

12:36.516 --> 12:38.917
but these dogs are
actually celebrity dogs.

12:38.985 --> 12:43.354
Oh, this one over here, he was
in a movie with George Clooney.

12:43.390 --> 12:44.923
Oh, cool.

12:44.991 --> 12:47.225
And this one is friends
with John Leguizamo.

12:49.662 --> 12:51.328
I think I'll take the Clooney one.

12:51.363 --> 12:52.530
That's an excellent choice.

12:52.565 --> 12:55.232
Not a Leguizamo fan?

12:58.604 --> 13:00.003
Move, I gotta pour one out.

13:00.039 --> 13:02.506
"Employees are allotted

13:02.542 --> 13:04.542
one bathroom break per shift."

13:04.577 --> 13:06.009
You took one a little earlier.

13:06.045 --> 13:07.411
I know 'cause I wrote it down.

13:07.446 --> 13:09.212
That was a false alarm. I barely went.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.680
We're talking less than a half an ounce.

13:10.715 --> 13:13.383
What was it they said about rules?

13:13.419 --> 13:16.253
That's right, rules are rules.

13:16.288 --> 13:17.620
You think this bothers me?

13:17.689 --> 13:19.189
I do a thousand Kegels a day.

13:19.224 --> 13:22.059
I could break a walnut down there.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.393
Okay, I have the papers

13:24.429 --> 13:27.430
all ready for both of you to sign.

13:27.466 --> 13:30.806
Just as soon as Ricky texts me
your Social Security number.

13:30.807 --> 13:32.806
Hey, my boy Ricky's got all my numbers.

13:32.842 --> 13:36.344
Okay, you know what, homies,
I've been thinking.

13:36.379 --> 13:38.346
Nerd.

13:38.381 --> 13:40.214
I'm not sure I still love this.

13:40.249 --> 13:43.350
I mean this kitchen, isn't it too open?

13:43.385 --> 13:46.418
I mean, you can be attacked
from any direction here.

13:47.722 --> 13:49.321
Oh.

13:49.357 --> 13:50.757
That is Ricky with your Social.

13:50.825 --> 13:53.159
Yeah, boy, let's do this.

13:53.194 --> 13:56.328
And that is Ricky's penis.

13:56.364 --> 13:58.731
Naw, that's Jared's. Ricky wishes.

14:06.540 --> 14:10.208
Go ahead, pick out anything
you want under $10.

14:10.244 --> 14:11.510
Oh, that's okay.

14:11.545 --> 14:14.079
Besides all the jewelry
here gives me a rash.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.414
So sorry to interrupt.

14:15.449 --> 14:17.716
Cheyenne, can I speak to you
for a moment alone?

14:17.752 --> 14:19.217
Sure, I'll miss you.

14:19.253 --> 14:20.451
Thanks.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.123
- Cheyenne?
- Mm-hmm?

14:25.192 --> 14:26.524
You cannot go out with that guy.

14:26.559 --> 14:27.759
Why?

14:27.795 --> 14:29.394
Because he's a middle-aged man.

14:29.429 --> 14:30.896
And because he was your teacher.

14:30.931 --> 14:32.463
Do you really need another reason?

14:32.532 --> 14:37.402
Cole says we are all teachers
and journeymen and thieves.

14:37.437 --> 14:39.069
Isn't that beautiful?

14:39.105 --> 14:40.405
No, it's terrible.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.407
And what about Bo?

14:42.442 --> 14:43.474
Really?

14:43.543 --> 14:44.909
I always thought
that you didn't like Bo.

14:44.944 --> 14:46.944
I'm probably just a little intimidated

14:46.979 --> 14:50.981
by his talent, and his looks,
and, you know, his face.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.983
He's the whole package.

14:53.052 --> 14:55.385
Oh, that's really nice of you to say.

14:55.421 --> 14:57.254
I don't know why he doesn't like you.

14:57.290 --> 14:59.056
I'm sorry, what?

14:59.091 --> 15:00.557
Bo doesn't like me?

15:00.592 --> 15:02.893
Yeah, he says you're a poser.

15:02.929 --> 15:04.094
Okay. Um.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.063
Whatever. That's beside the point.

15:06.098 --> 15:09.899
The point is if I had to pick
between Bo and Cole,

15:09.935 --> 15:10.967
I would pick Bo.

15:11.002 --> 15:13.069
If those were my only two options.

15:13.104 --> 15:15.572
Okay, I'll think about it.

15:15.607 --> 15:17.307
He really called me a poser?

15:17.343 --> 15:19.175
Yeah, a big one.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.447
Bo's the poser.

15:23.482 --> 15:26.015
Oh, God.

15:26.084 --> 15:27.917
Oh, God.

15:27.953 --> 15:31.454
Oh, God, oh, God.
You're fine. You're fine.

15:31.489 --> 15:32.989
You're fine, you're fine.
You can hold it forever.

15:33.024 --> 15:34.958
It's like a steel trap.

15:38.096 --> 15:40.929
I gotta say, we made a pretty good team.

15:40.965 --> 15:42.998
And I usually hate being in teams.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.333
I can get pretty competitive.

15:44.369 --> 15:48.838
You know what, I actually
used to be the same way.

15:48.873 --> 15:51.340
It's why I burnt out of business school.

15:51.376 --> 15:52.842
I thought you flunked out.

15:52.877 --> 15:56.311
Well, I flunked out because I burnt out.

15:56.347 --> 15:58.013
Sounds like you're making excuses.

15:58.048 --> 15:59.314
Well, you weren't there so.

15:59.686 --> 16:02.653
Anyway, the point
is I got super stressed

16:02.654 --> 16:04.119
about being the best in my class,

16:04.119 --> 16:08.488
and I ended up in the hospital
with dehydration for two days.

16:08.556 --> 16:10.323
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:10.392 --> 16:14.393
I once got dehydration so bad
I was hospitalized for a month.

16:14.428 --> 16:16.462
They said it was like the
worst case they'd ever seen.

16:16.498 --> 16:19.499
Oh, my God. Really?

16:19.567 --> 16:22.635
No, I was just trying
to beat your story.

16:22.670 --> 16:25.270
Sorry, I'm competitive.

16:25.306 --> 16:26.639
Yeah, well.

16:26.674 --> 16:28.608
We all got our stuff.

16:28.643 --> 16:30.275
I got more stuff than you, though.

16:30.311 --> 16:32.677
Okay.

16:32.746 --> 16:34.679
I want to talk last.

16:34.748 --> 16:38.517
Bo "The Truth" Thompson.

16:38.585 --> 16:40.519
Ya boy, who's got... Okay, all right.

16:40.587 --> 16:44.756
That's plenty. Now, Glenn.

16:44.791 --> 16:46.458
Oh. Thank you.

16:52.432 --> 16:54.198
Yo, it's G-L-E-M.

16:54.267 --> 16:56.134
Okay, I know how to spell my own name,

16:56.169 --> 16:58.670
and it's Glenn, not Glem.

16:58.705 --> 16:59.971
Glenn?

17:00.007 --> 17:01.640
What the hell kind of name is Glenn?

17:01.675 --> 17:02.974
I can't sign this.

17:03.010 --> 17:05.143
- I'm sorry.
- What?

17:05.178 --> 17:07.545
Take the job in St. Louis, Kathy.

17:07.613 --> 17:09.780
You won't miss New York at all.

17:09.815 --> 17:12.282
- Christ.
- Katherine.

17:12.318 --> 17:14.685
Okay, this was your idea, yo.

17:14.720 --> 17:18.522
If it was just my money
I wouldn't care, I swear.

17:18.558 --> 17:21.191
But I have a family, Bo.

17:21.226 --> 17:23.160
I'm sorry.

17:25.698 --> 17:27.665
You know, I get it.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.399
Maybe someday, right?

17:29.468 --> 17:31.334
Get a place just like this.

17:31.370 --> 17:35.238
Mark the baby's tallness on the
door frame, just watch her grow.

17:35.307 --> 17:38.375
Sit around here and
have dinners together,

17:38.410 --> 17:40.043
watching the news,

17:40.079 --> 17:42.512
roasting chestnuts on an open fire.

17:42.548 --> 17:43.646
Mm-hmm.

17:43.682 --> 17:46.249
Folks all dressed up like "Exkimos."

17:46.318 --> 17:48.718
Cripes, Kathy, fine, you've got a sale.

17:48.753 --> 17:51.521
- What?
- Oh, hooray a rental.

17:51.557 --> 17:53.355
I just made $12.

17:53.391 --> 17:55.357
Why you got to be a [Bleep] Kathy?

17:57.740 --> 18:00.838
I'm really not sure we're
meant to be together.

18:00.839 --> 18:02.104
I totally understand,

18:02.140 --> 18:03.973
but I am sure

18:04.008 --> 18:05.607
and I'm the adult here,

18:05.643 --> 18:09.478
so why don't we go
and talk about it in my car?

18:09.513 --> 18:10.779
Oh, hell, no.

18:10.815 --> 18:12.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Eastwick?

18:12.683 --> 18:15.951
Mr. Thompson, uh, nice to s... see you.

18:15.986 --> 18:17.118
You flunked me out of English class,

18:17.154 --> 18:18.520
and now you're flirting
with my girl, son?

18:18.556 --> 18:20.155
Bo, nothing is going on.

18:20.190 --> 18:21.557
Let's just talk this through.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.124
Talk it through like one of
the "Voices of Fiction"?

18:23.160 --> 18:25.561
We're not there right now.
We're in my house, boy.

18:25.629 --> 18:27.195
- Okay.
- How do you like that, huh?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.663
- I don't like it.
- What're you talking about?

18:28.698 --> 18:30.498
Read this book.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.734
You little bitch.

18:32.802 --> 18:34.169
Don't hurt Bo.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.545
Oh, my God, the shampoo!

18:44.581 --> 18:45.813
Yeah, hit him!

18:45.849 --> 18:47.815
Oh, God, this is pathetic.

18:47.851 --> 18:49.684
Come on guys, no.

18:49.719 --> 18:51.185
Break it up.

18:51.220 --> 18:52.854
Whoa, someone's touching my junk.

18:52.889 --> 18:53.921
No!

18:53.990 --> 18:55.690
He's so romantic.

18:55.725 --> 18:56.924
No. Come on, put away your camera.

18:56.993 --> 18:58.926
There's nothing interesting here.

18:58.995 --> 19:00.995
Now Brett's got to clean this up.

19:01.030 --> 19:03.530
Come on, guys. Be considerate.

19:03.565 --> 19:06.166
There's nothing interesting here.

19:08.604 --> 19:11.671
The comments are so mean.

19:11.707 --> 19:16.010
Do I look like "a gigantic, red baby"?

19:16.045 --> 19:17.577
No.

19:17.613 --> 19:19.880
Oh, what's the hurry?

19:19.915 --> 19:21.347
Bathroom. I'm off the clock.

19:21.383 --> 19:24.083
Oh, you know what, restrooms
are for customers only,

19:24.119 --> 19:27.037
and it doesn't appear that
you've purchased anything.

19:30.793 --> 19:33.192
- Oh, a stapler?
- Yeah, I could use this.

19:33.228 --> 19:35.128
Sure you can. We could
all use a stapler.

19:35.196 --> 19:36.695
You're gonna pay for this tomorrow.

19:36.731 --> 19:39.065
- I don't work tomorrow.
- Then the next day.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.866
- Not until Sunday.
- Sunday then.

19:40.902 --> 19:43.937
Sunday you will pay for...
oh wait, I'm not in Sunday.

19:43.972 --> 19:44.938
Damn it.

19:44.973 --> 19:46.973
This is so worth the two hours.

19:47.042 --> 19:48.707
I hate you so much.

19:48.743 --> 19:52.044
Guys, thank you both so
much for everything.

19:52.079 --> 19:54.279
So is everything okay with Bo?

19:54.315 --> 19:56.916
Yeah, we're not gonna
get married this weekend,

19:56.951 --> 19:58.855
but we're gonna be okay.

19:58.856 --> 20:00.755
Yo, Chey, where the dog treats at, yo?

20:00.799 --> 20:05.032
You adopted many dogs.

20:05.064 --> 20:06.463
Oh yeah, I got it all figured out.

20:06.499 --> 20:07.899
The dogs take care of the baby,

20:07.934 --> 20:10.067
and the baby grows up
and takes care of the dogs.

20:10.103 --> 20:11.769
Whomp. Whomp.

20:11.805 --> 20:14.071
- Circle of life.
- She gets it.

20:14.107 --> 20:15.973
See, I'm not a poser.

20:16.009 --> 20:18.475
Lets get them to their new home.

20:18.511 --> 20:20.611
This is Ding-Dong. That's Weed.

20:20.646 --> 20:23.580
This is Richard, and that's Snapdragon.

20:23.616 --> 20:25.582
There goes my security deposit.

20:25.618 --> 20:26.917
Oh, yeah.

20:26.952 --> 20:29.920
Wow, you guys really got
all the dogs adopted.

20:29.955 --> 20:32.656
- Yup.
- That's great.

20:32.692 --> 20:35.926
I guess I'll just wait till next
week to see the injection guy.

20:35.961 --> 20:37.695
You know what, I'm an adult.

20:37.763 --> 20:40.463
I'm gonna call him on the...
I'm gonna text him.

20:40.498 --> 20:42.933
- Sounds good.
- Cool.

20:42.968 --> 20:44.201
I'm gonna do it now.

20:47.972 --> 20:50.172
Well, nice working with you.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.107
It was nice working with you too.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.498
Hey, you know, I was thinking
of seeing a movie tonight

20:55.499 --> 20:56.464
if you want...

20:56.500 --> 20:57.699
I'm seeing two movies.

20:57.735 --> 20:59.334
Okay.

20:59.369 --> 21:03.905
Oh, the dogs are all gone?

21:03.906 --> 21:05.794
- Girl.
- Uh-huh.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.062
Were they cuddly?

21:08.131 --> 21:11.132
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

21:11.167 --> 21:13.300
Yeah.
