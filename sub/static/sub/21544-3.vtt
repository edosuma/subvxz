WEBVTT

00:05.085 --> 00:07.257
<i> I'm Johnny,
 the brains of the outfit.</i>

00:07.257 --> 00:10.300
<i> And I'm his twin brother,
 Randy, the handsome one.</i>

00:10.300 --> 00:13.684
<i>And we got ahead
by building furniture.</i>

00:13.684 --> 00:15.556
<i> For your feet.</i>

00:15.556 --> 00:17.137
<i>Welcome to our...</i>

00:18.478 --> 00:20.230
This show is so dumb.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.563
You could always
turn off the telly.

00:22.563 --> 00:24.645
The remote's
way over there.

00:27.317 --> 00:28.488
Oh, forget it.

00:28.488 --> 00:31.201
Any big plans for today?

00:31.201 --> 00:34.414
Thought I'd move to
the big TV in a few hours.

00:34.414 --> 00:36.917
You know...
( belches )

00:39.620 --> 00:42.122
Aahh! Do we have
any more Pep?

00:42.122 --> 00:44.625
You've got six
full cans right here.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.506
I only like
that first sip.

00:46.506 --> 00:49.299
Peak carbonation.
Never mind, I'll call Beakley.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.301
Oh, man,
my phone's dead.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.262
Guess I gotta
buy a new one.

00:52.262 --> 00:53.934
Just charge it.

00:53.934 --> 00:55.676
Eh, this one's
three months old anyway.

00:55.676 --> 00:58.178
Who cares? We're rich.

00:58.178 --> 01:00.601
No.<i> I'm</i> rich.

01:00.601 --> 01:03.734
That's it, laddie.
You are coming to the office

01:03.734 --> 01:06.356
to learn the value
of a hard day's work.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.288 --> 01:20.160
Whatcha doin'?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.833
- I'm not breaking in;
you're breaking in.
- Busted.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.546
You think I put glitter
on my top-secret notebooks
just because it's pretty?

01:26.546 --> 01:28.168
Well, sure,
it's a perk, but...

01:28.168 --> 01:29.590
I'm sorry.
I was just looking

01:29.590 --> 01:31.762
for information
about my family.

01:31.762 --> 01:34.214
You shoulda asked.
What do you want,
shoe sizes,

01:34.214 --> 01:36.266
horrible dark secrets
known only to
your Uncle Scrooge

01:36.266 --> 01:38.268
that could change
the fate of the world
as we know it?

01:38.268 --> 01:40.721
- What do you know
about my mom?
- ( gasps )

01:42.773 --> 01:44.274
What do you know
about your mom?

01:44.274 --> 01:46.817
Uncle Donald just told us
she was gone.

01:46.817 --> 01:50.320
The only thing
we have of her is this photo.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.782
Photographic evidence!

01:51.782 --> 01:53.824
I've gotta add it to
my Della Duck file.

01:53.824 --> 01:56.156
You have a whole file
on my mom?

01:56.156 --> 01:58.739
Seriously? This is it?

01:58.739 --> 02:01.662
I've been looking
into her for years,
but there's nothing.

02:01.662 --> 02:05.085
No photos, no records.
No one even talks about her.

02:05.085 --> 02:08.588
One time, a piece of
junk mail with her name
on it showed up at our door,

02:08.588 --> 02:11.251
and a day later,
Scrooge bought the post office,

02:11.251 --> 02:13.964
and I never saw
our mailman again.

02:13.964 --> 02:15.966
Maybe he retired?

02:15.966 --> 02:18.809
Bad things happen
to people who ask
about Della Duck.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.851
So who are we gonna ask?

02:22.392 --> 02:25.265

You have arrived

02:59.259 --> 03:02.933
Be back at 6:00,
Launchpad.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.976
We've a long, hard
day of work ahead of us.

03:07.147 --> 03:08.939
Gotcha, Mr. McD.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.941
Thanks for letting us
tag along, Uncle Scrooge,

03:10.941 --> 03:15.405
but I suddenly very much
have to use the bathroom.

03:15.405 --> 03:18.949
Oh, and I will show you
where to go to that place.

03:21.912 --> 03:23.453
Oh, no, you don't.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.325
( bell dings )

03:27.707 --> 03:29.709
What is this place?

03:29.709 --> 03:32.462
The private library
of Scrooge McDuck.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.886
If there's info
about your mom,
it's in here.

03:42.052 --> 03:43.894
Go away, Webby.

03:43.894 --> 03:46.516
For the last time,
Mr. McDuck's archives

03:46.516 --> 03:47.938
are strictly off-limits.

03:47.938 --> 03:50.941
Except to
his family.

03:50.941 --> 03:52.352
Meet Dewey Duck.

03:53.854 --> 03:56.526
Behold, heir of
Clan McDuck,

03:56.526 --> 03:59.119
the Archives!

03:59.119 --> 04:00.911
( bell dings )

04:00.911 --> 04:01.952
( gasps )

04:11.371 --> 04:13.333
The money!

04:14.674 --> 04:16.546
You want me to count
the gold?

04:16.546 --> 04:18.428
Can we go out
and spend some gold

04:18.428 --> 04:19.759
to make sure
it doesn't expire?

04:19.759 --> 04:22.682
There's more to money
than just money.

04:22.682 --> 04:25.225
Gold is a beautiful thing,

04:25.225 --> 04:28.308
but even something
as small as a dime
can have meaning.

04:28.308 --> 04:29.349
For instance...

04:31.561 --> 04:34.484
Are you out of your head?
You'll crack your skull open.

04:34.484 --> 04:36.276
But you swim in money
all the time.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.569
Yes, but I worked hard
to perfect that skill,

04:39.569 --> 04:42.402
building muscles
and dexterity.

04:42.402 --> 04:45.906
If you want something,
you work hard to get it.

04:45.906 --> 04:49.079
SECRETARY: <i> Mr. McDuck,
 the board is here to see you.</i>

04:49.079 --> 04:50.871
We don't have
a board meeting today.

04:50.871 --> 04:52.672
No matter.
Come, lad.

04:52.672 --> 04:55.465
Welcome to the fast-paced
world of business.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.588
As you know,
revenues are down

04:58.588 --> 05:00.130
in our international
markets--

05:00.130 --> 05:04.594
Dawson, Lillehammer,
Eldorado, and Culebra.

05:04.594 --> 05:06.186
We feel that--

05:06.186 --> 05:08.228
Shut up, everyone.
I've done something brilliant.

05:08.228 --> 05:10.480
Ah, Gyro.
Gyro Gearloose,

05:10.480 --> 05:12.602
my head of
research and development.

05:12.602 --> 05:15.525
- I'm sorry, but we--
- Apology accepted.

05:15.525 --> 05:17.487
Now try to keep up
with my mind-numbing genius.

05:17.487 --> 05:20.861
Gyro, what did we say about
interacting with other people?

05:20.861 --> 05:23.573
The cards. Fine.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.947
"Hello, Mr. McDuck,
and others.

05:26.947 --> 05:28.448
Are you tired of all those
single-use gadgets

05:28.448 --> 05:30.410
cluttering up
your junk drawer?

05:30.410 --> 05:32.162
What a mess.

05:32.162 --> 05:34.504
There's got to be
a better way!"

05:34.504 --> 05:36.296
Meet Lil' Bulb,
the tiny,

05:36.296 --> 05:38.168
all-purpose robot
that does it all.

05:38.168 --> 05:39.880
Wait, what does it do?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.962
It all.

05:41.962 --> 05:43.463
Lil' Bulb is an artificially
intelligent

05:43.463 --> 05:45.465
personal robot helper.

05:45.465 --> 05:47.968
He can make toast,
find your keys,

05:47.968 --> 05:50.560
serve as a book light
for your late-night reading.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.234
You'll never have to do
anything yourself again.

05:54.234 --> 05:57.067
Mm-hmm. And how do you
ensure this one

05:57.067 --> 05:59.779
won't achieve sentience and turn
evil like all the others?

05:59.779 --> 06:02.652
Only half my inventions
turn evil.

06:02.652 --> 06:05.245
The other half
are just wildly misunderstood.

06:05.245 --> 06:06.536
( buzzing )

06:06.536 --> 06:07.697
What's it doing?

06:09.659 --> 06:10.951
Waving. It likes you.

06:12.702 --> 06:14.494
Request denied.

06:14.494 --> 06:17.047
( sighs )

06:17.047 --> 06:19.920
Keep at it, Gyro.
I know you'll come up
with something great.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.962
Lil' Bulb
is something great.

06:21.962 --> 06:24.174
I'll show you.
I'll show you all!

06:24.174 --> 06:27.677
And maybe wait until
you're out of the room
to say that next time.

06:27.677 --> 06:29.469
A robot that does
everything for you?

06:29.469 --> 06:31.311
How could you
say no to that?

06:31.311 --> 06:33.853
Part of hard work
is knowing how
to work with others.

06:33.853 --> 06:36.897
My board are the only people
cheaper than I am.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.280
I trust them completely to make
good financial decisions--

06:40.280 --> 06:41.942
Indeed. Which is why
we've called this meeting

06:41.942 --> 06:43.613
to discuss cutting
your unnecessary spending

06:43.613 --> 06:46.326
here at the Money Bin.

06:46.326 --> 06:47.697
Unnecessary?!

06:47.697 --> 06:49.529
I'm Scrooge McDuck.

06:49.529 --> 06:51.741
I don't spend one penny
more than I need to.

06:51.741 --> 06:54.704
It's says here you're spending
$15 million

06:54.704 --> 06:57.037
on magical defense.

06:57.037 --> 06:59.169
Do you have any idea

06:59.169 --> 07:02.132
how many vengeance curses
I have on my head?

07:02.132 --> 07:04.594
Think I'm just
gonna go

07:04.594 --> 07:06.636
and get a drink.
Yeah.

07:08.008 --> 07:11.101
<i> The Collected
 Treasure Maps of Peruvia.</i>

07:11.101 --> 07:13.513
<i> The Topographical Atlas
 of Plain Awful.</i>

07:13.513 --> 07:17.107
<i> Scrooge's Favorite Smells,
 Volume 12.</i>

07:17.107 --> 07:19.689
Fresh cookies.
I knew it.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.940
Focus, Webby.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.363
We're here to find out
about Della Duck.

07:23.363 --> 07:26.566
So the blue one seeks
to learn of his past.

07:26.566 --> 07:29.739
But is he strong enough
to learn the truth?

07:29.739 --> 07:31.992
Yes.

07:31.992 --> 07:34.704
Wrong! You must first
prove yourself worthy

07:34.704 --> 07:37.417
by passing the trials!

07:39.379 --> 07:40.960
( coughing )

07:40.960 --> 07:42.712
This is my new
favorite library.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.084
( bell dings )

07:46.716 --> 07:48.138
A dollar ten?

07:48.138 --> 07:50.640
Who keeps dimes on them
anymore?

07:57.517 --> 07:59.359
Sweet. Scrooge has
an emergency dime.

08:02.862 --> 08:05.025
I'll pay you back later.

08:05.025 --> 08:07.567
But how do you justify
spending $5,000

08:07.567 --> 08:09.949
on a velvet pillow
for a dime?

08:09.949 --> 08:13.413
That dime deserves
its own velvet pillow.

08:13.413 --> 08:15.705
It's my number-one dime.

08:15.705 --> 08:18.168
The first dime
I ever earned.

08:18.168 --> 08:21.041
I was a young shoe shine
in Glasgow

08:21.041 --> 08:24.084
<i> when a man came in,
 his boots cemented in mud.</i>

08:24.084 --> 08:28.628
<i> I worked and worked until
 those boots sparkled.</i>

08:28.628 --> 08:33.263
<i> In return, he gave me
 an American dime.</i>

08:33.263 --> 08:37.015
<i> That dime inspired me
 to move to America</i>

08:37.015 --> 08:39.188
and find my fortune.

08:39.188 --> 08:42.812
It means more to me
than every bit of bullion

08:42.812 --> 08:44.644
in my Money Bin.

08:44.644 --> 08:45.645
( slurping )

08:45.645 --> 08:47.487
( gulps )
Uh...

08:47.487 --> 08:49.649
I gotta go. Bye.

08:51.071 --> 08:52.652
Gotta get the dime,
gotta get the dime!

08:52.652 --> 08:53.993
( sighs )

08:54.994 --> 08:57.037
( panting )

08:59.249 --> 09:00.870
( music playing
over headphones )

09:03.083 --> 09:04.874
No, no, no, no...

09:04.874 --> 09:06.046
( bell dings )

09:06.046 --> 09:07.797
57?

09:07.797 --> 09:08.668
Oh, boy.

09:08.668 --> 09:12.672
( panting )

09:15.345 --> 09:16.806
Come on!

09:20.810 --> 09:24.064
Hey. Wait.
The dime!

09:24.064 --> 09:25.605
Ahh!

09:31.861 --> 09:33.653
Okay. Easy.

09:33.653 --> 09:36.786
Break in, grab the dime,
sneak back downstairs,

09:36.786 --> 09:38.868
Oh, maybe stop at
the vending machine.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.168
Well, I'm dead.

09:51.711 --> 09:53.633
WOMAN: <i> Today we're gonna teach
 you how to pick a lock.</i>

09:53.633 --> 09:56.846
<i> First you need a small,
 thin object, like a dime.</i>

09:56.846 --> 09:58.718
If I had that,
I wouldn't need the video!

09:58.718 --> 10:00.930
No, don't switch to an ad.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.062
<i> This week on
</i> Ottoman Empire,

10:03.062 --> 10:05.525
<i> we're working on an ottoman
 for Flintheart Glomgold.</i>

10:05.525 --> 10:07.277
<i> He wants an ottoman
 with storage</i>

10:07.277 --> 10:08.728
<i> by this afternoon!</i>

10:08.728 --> 10:11.691
( laughs ) They're never
gonna get that ottoman

10:11.691 --> 10:13.863
tufted in time.
Focus!

10:17.497 --> 10:21.040
Aw, there's gotta be
a better way.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.874
Fools! They'll rue the day they
overlooked us, Lil' Bulb.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.796
Ding!
Wait, hold the elev--

10:28.748 --> 10:30.210
( groans )

10:30.210 --> 10:32.212
So what do you know
about my mom?

10:32.212 --> 10:33.883
Was she really
an adventurer?

10:33.883 --> 10:37.347
Silence!
Behold your first test.

10:37.347 --> 10:41.891
You must decipher the ancient
and mysterious code within.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.933
Yes! I love codes!

10:43.933 --> 10:46.065
Dewey, you start with
a Number Shift Cipher

10:46.065 --> 10:48.318
while I try
a Monoalphabetic Substitution.

10:48.318 --> 10:50.270
Pretty sure this is
just a library card catalogue.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.611
Mystery solved.

10:51.611 --> 10:53.443
Oh, yeah? If it's
just a card catalogue,

10:53.443 --> 10:56.776
then how does it
know your name?

10:56.776 --> 10:58.658
Come on!

11:05.545 --> 11:06.746
( panting )

11:06.746 --> 11:08.838
Hey, Gyro Gearloose.

11:08.838 --> 11:10.750
If this is about
the Gearloose Magnetic backpack,

11:10.750 --> 11:12.792
I specifically said
they should not be used

11:12.792 --> 11:14.884
as school bags.
Blathering blatherskite,

11:14.884 --> 11:16.886
one teen gets stuck
to a moving school bus.

11:16.886 --> 11:18.558
No, no, no, no, no.

11:18.558 --> 11:20.930
Louie Duck,
Scrooge's super-rich nephew.

11:22.762 --> 11:24.804
Keep talking... sir.

11:24.804 --> 11:26.856
I can't believe Scrooge
and that tired old
board of his

11:26.856 --> 11:29.108
didn't see the potential
in Lil' Bulb here.

11:29.108 --> 11:32.862
I'd love to invest,
but I'm gonna need

11:32.862 --> 11:34.404
to test this little guy
out first.

11:34.404 --> 11:36.316
Do you mind if I borrow
him for the afternoon?

11:36.316 --> 11:38.278
Anything you say,
rich nephew.

11:38.278 --> 11:40.200
Lil' Bulb, you be good.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.702
Don't you rise up
against your masters.

11:43.993 --> 11:46.746
Ha ha. Just a little
robot humor.

11:49.539 --> 11:52.422
Wait. I need to go...
up!

11:52.422 --> 11:55.215
( imitating Scrooge )
Put in a hard day's work.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.837
I think I'm so much
smarter than--

11:57.837 --> 11:59.599
Louie! Where
have you been?

11:59.599 --> 12:01.050
Trying to get out
of work again.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.142
What? No.

12:03.142 --> 12:04.804
I just, um...

12:04.804 --> 12:07.227
filled up my notepad
with all that precious
business wisdom,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.058
so I went to go
find another.

12:09.058 --> 12:11.441
Good lad.

12:11.441 --> 12:13.853
You're free to take
as many pads as you want.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.275
Or are we not allowed
to use those either,

12:15.275 --> 12:17.277
ye penny-pinching
buzzards?!

12:17.277 --> 12:19.279
No, but really.

12:19.279 --> 12:21.361
Make sure to use the front
and back of every page.

12:21.361 --> 12:23.743
And write small.

12:25.865 --> 12:27.667
And that's how
you unlock a door.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.420
- Good job, Louie.
- ( buzzing )

12:30.420 --> 12:32.962
Finding one specific dime
in this mess

12:32.962 --> 12:35.335
is gonna be
a pretty big job.

12:35.335 --> 12:36.966
You better get to it.

12:44.053 --> 12:46.145
It's, like, a dime.
Ah, you'll find it.

12:46.145 --> 12:48.848
<i> Ready to put your feet up,
 Mr. Glomgold?</i>

12:48.848 --> 12:50.229
<i> You call this
 an ottoman?</i>

12:50.229 --> 12:51.811
<i> It does not even
 have my face on it.</i>

12:51.811 --> 12:52.892
<i> Do it again!</i>

12:52.892 --> 12:55.735
( laughing )

13:17.677 --> 13:20.089
In order to gain knowledge
from the Archives,

13:20.089 --> 13:23.303
one must first
offer up knowledge.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.264
Look, Quackfaster.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.557
Normally I would be super-into
a mysterious conspiracy quest.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.058
But couldn't you
at least give me

13:29.058 --> 13:30.930
a tiny piece of
information on my mom?

13:30.930 --> 13:33.483
Dewey, don't question
the ancient methods.

13:33.483 --> 13:34.984
I'm just saying,

13:34.984 --> 13:36.356
these are feeling a little
less like trials,

13:36.356 --> 13:37.937
and a little more
like stalling.

13:37.937 --> 13:41.701
It is not for us to understand
the ways of the Archives.

13:41.701 --> 13:44.113
That is literally
your job.

13:44.113 --> 13:45.905
I'm out.
She doesn't know anything.

13:45.905 --> 13:48.998
No. None shall leave
once the Trials are undertaken.

13:48.998 --> 13:52.291
There are those who would
destroy you for the knowledge
you seek.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.294
( whispers )
Just like the mailman.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.547
Who's gonna destroy me?
Scrooge? The government?

13:57.547 --> 13:58.918
The Unicorn Illuminati?

13:58.918 --> 14:00.299
- Me.
- Wait.
- What?!

14:03.803 --> 14:07.387
GLOMGOLD: <i> You expect me
 to put my feet up on
 my own face, you loons?</i>

14:07.387 --> 14:09.429
<i> Do it again!</i>

14:09.429 --> 14:11.641
I used to hate this show,
but now, I kinda love it.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.523
It's like every ottoman
tells a story.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.976
Hey, you found it.

14:16.976 --> 14:18.978
Great job... little buddy.

14:24.534 --> 14:26.536
( shrieking )

14:29.829 --> 14:31.751
If you can find me 3,000 gallons
of silver polish for cheaper,

14:31.751 --> 14:33.703
I'd love to hear about it!

14:33.703 --> 14:35.374
This is getting us nowhere.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.336
If you won't make
your own cuts,

14:37.336 --> 14:39.799
then we're forced to fire staff
at the Bin to save money.

14:39.799 --> 14:42.171
The obvious choice
is the archivist.

14:42.171 --> 14:44.343
Fire Quackfaster?! Never!

14:44.343 --> 14:46.596
For 50 years, that woman's
level-headedness

14:46.596 --> 14:49.599
has kept my archives
secure and orderly.

14:49.599 --> 14:51.811
You disrespect the Archives,

14:51.811 --> 14:55.104
you shall become
one with the Archives!

14:55.104 --> 14:56.816
This isn't working.

14:56.816 --> 14:58.397
Here. Knowledge is
the greatest weapon of all.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.659
Fine. Quackfaster stays.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.411
But Gyro is definitely
unnecessary.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.123
Are you insane?!

15:14.123 --> 15:16.165
Gyro Gearloose is
one of the most brilliant minds

15:16.165 --> 15:17.587
of our time.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.172
You miserable
piece of rust.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.844
I am man,
you are machine.

15:24.844 --> 15:27.386
Do as I command
or I will pull your plug.

15:27.386 --> 15:29.258
Aaah! He's turned
against me.

15:29.258 --> 15:31.811
He's sucking up
all the dimes. Help, help!

15:34.013 --> 15:35.645
Oh.

15:40.229 --> 15:42.271
If you're going to fire
all the employees,

15:42.271 --> 15:44.824
why don't you just go ahead
and shut the whole Bin down?

15:44.824 --> 15:47.066
You do have a perfectly
good office downtown.

15:47.066 --> 15:50.239
Do you really need
a Money Bin?

15:53.833 --> 15:55.334
I think we lost her.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.246
Foolish child.

15:57.246 --> 15:58.838
You do not know
what you think you know.

15:58.838 --> 16:00.630
I don't know
anything,

16:00.630 --> 16:02.672
and it's really
frustrating!

16:04.884 --> 16:06.045
- Louie!
- Louie, over here.

16:06.045 --> 16:07.466
( screams )

16:07.466 --> 16:08.928
Uh, never mind.

16:08.928 --> 16:10.680
Look, a distraction.

16:16.055 --> 16:18.688
Lazy Tuesday
was an afternoon of TV.

16:18.688 --> 16:22.151
Hard working
was giant robot attack.

16:22.151 --> 16:23.482
Great life lesson, Scrooge.

16:32.702 --> 16:34.744
No!

16:34.744 --> 16:36.165
You are not evil.

16:36.165 --> 16:38.207
You are good,
Lil' Bulb.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.169
Good.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.022
You cannot
get rid of the Bin.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.234
You may think they're
crackpots and weirdos,

17:06.234 --> 17:08.237
but they're the ones
who push innovation,

17:08.237 --> 17:12.531
and creativity, and spur
this company ever forward.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.705
Just a little malfunction.

17:16.705 --> 17:19.367
Definitely not evil.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.369
Look, they're all mad as loons,
and if you fire them,

17:21.369 --> 17:23.752
they're definitely
going to seek revenge.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.374
All in favor of
keeping the Bin

17:25.374 --> 17:27.587
and everyone in it
far away from our offices.

17:27.587 --> 17:28.758
ALL: Aye!

17:31.260 --> 17:32.932
No!!

17:38.938 --> 17:40.099
Come on!

17:46.776 --> 17:48.147
( panting )

17:49.398 --> 17:51.781
No. No, no, no, no, no!

17:51.781 --> 17:53.903
Mine, mine. Wait!
Wait, wait, mine!

17:57.156 --> 17:59.158
Of course.

17:59.158 --> 18:01.250
Book throw,
book throw.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.702
Throwing books.

18:02.702 --> 18:04.203
This is our last book.

18:04.203 --> 18:05.665
Make it count.

18:05.665 --> 18:07.376
What are you doing?

18:07.376 --> 18:09.589
Don't come any closer,
or the book gets it.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.971
I will crease
this corner, man,

18:11.971 --> 18:13.382
so back off.

18:13.382 --> 18:15.474
Tell me about
my mom.

18:15.474 --> 18:17.346
Why don't you
see for yourself?

18:17.346 --> 18:20.219
This is it.
This is it!

18:20.219 --> 18:22.351
This is...

18:22.351 --> 18:23.683
nothing.

18:25.224 --> 18:27.396
Wait. I've seen
that number before.

18:27.396 --> 18:29.488
Follow me.

18:29.488 --> 18:31.490
Just a dime,
just a dime.

18:31.490 --> 18:34.193
Oh, a quarter!
Wait, there it is.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.827
Oh, I know
what went wrong.

18:37.827 --> 18:39.659
This is a 75-watt bulb.

18:39.659 --> 18:41.540
Lil' Bulb's only built
for 50.

18:41.540 --> 18:44.003
Ha ha, he just went
a little mad with power.

18:53.462 --> 18:54.804
Whoa, what the...

18:56.215 --> 18:58.758
So you write me a check or...

18:58.758 --> 19:00.389
( growls )

19:00.389 --> 19:01.761
A pleasure as always.

19:01.761 --> 19:03.262
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

19:03.262 --> 19:05.064
Please don't need me.

19:06.315 --> 19:08.107
I don't understand.

19:08.107 --> 19:09.689
It should be here
somewhere.

19:09.689 --> 19:12.031
Wait. These books.

19:12.031 --> 19:13.532
They're all
out of order.

19:13.532 --> 19:15.905
Quackfaster's a lot
of things, but
she's not sloppy.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.737
QUACKFASTER:
<i> Use your training.</i>

19:17.737 --> 19:19.869
<i> The most valuable knowledge
 must be learned.</i>

19:19.869 --> 19:22.281
Okay, how much of this
is about us doing
your work for you?

19:22.281 --> 19:25.624
<i> About 50%.</i>

19:34.253 --> 19:36.385
Curse me kilts!

19:37.426 --> 19:40.429
Come on, come on,
you got this!

20:02.661 --> 20:04.283
Oh, there you are.

20:04.283 --> 20:06.325
( panting )
I can't catch my breath.

20:06.325 --> 20:07.536
Don't be so dramatic.

20:07.536 --> 20:09.328
A little work
never killed anybody.

20:09.328 --> 20:12.421
Okay, here goes.
Ow!

20:12.421 --> 20:14.754
What is up
with this stupid library?

20:14.754 --> 20:17.757
COMPUTER VOICE:
<i> Duck family DNA recognized.</i>

20:22.261 --> 20:23.893
Wow!

20:30.649 --> 20:32.481
Mom...

20:32.481 --> 20:34.523
Why would this stuff
be hidden?

20:34.523 --> 20:37.486
- I gotta show
Huey and Louie.
- Wait. What's this?

20:37.486 --> 20:40.449
DEWEY: "Scrooge, I've taken
the Spear of Selene.

20:40.449 --> 20:42.952
I'm sorry. Della."

20:42.952 --> 20:45.494
Wait, what did she take?
Why is she sorry?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.497
Did she betray
your Uncle Scrooge?

20:48.497 --> 20:52.291
We can't tell anyone
about this until we
find out what it means.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.464
I'm proud of you, lad.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.466
You put in
a full day at the office.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.428
I think you've
earned this.

20:59.428 --> 21:01.550
You're giving me
your number-one dime?

21:01.550 --> 21:03.432
It's not my lucky dime.

21:03.432 --> 21:05.554
I never let my dime
out of my sight.

21:05.554 --> 21:06.806
That was just a decoy.

21:06.806 --> 21:08.597
I'm not an idiot.

21:08.597 --> 21:10.229
This place is
full of lunatics.

21:10.229 --> 21:12.391
A dime sure means more

21:12.391 --> 21:15.354
when you have to work
for it, eh, lad?

21:16.946 --> 21:20.399
Maybe I'll get my own
velvet pillow for this baby.

21:20.399 --> 21:22.241
Oh, hold up.

21:24.533 --> 21:28.537
Noooooo!!

21:30.669 --> 21:32.501
Gyro creates robot...

21:32.501 --> 21:34.123
Robot gains free will...

21:36.585 --> 21:39.008
Robot turns on Gyro...

21:39.008 --> 21:41.720
Gyro controls robot...

21:41.720 --> 21:45.304
Gyro is robot...
