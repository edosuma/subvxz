11:20.379 --> 11:23.147
Well, according to him, you're
the one playing hard to get.

me to play hard to get?

11:28.987 --> 11:29.987
Good point.

11:31.156 --> 11:32.123
But the whole reason he's going

11:32.157 --> 11:34.158
to the party tonight is
because he wants to see you,

11:34.192 --> 11:36.027
and that says "interested" to me...

11:36.061 --> 11:40.064
- as does that dress.
- Do you think he'll like it?

11:40.098 --> 11:43.067
Trust me, he's a dude, and
we all like the same thing...

straps we can figure out in the dark.

Let me check my hair.

your pay-per-view.

- I didn't think y'all were coming back until tomorrow.

Oh, Gerard and I
caught an earlier flight

You should come, get a sitter.

- Yes.

and do laundry tonight.

- Ooh, sorry.

"Tucker, help out behind the bar,"

I think she meant, "Tucker,
help out behind the bar."

staff didn't show up.

not being evaluated.

one more thing go wrong.

some tables? I'll help Ben.

think you didn't like me.

everywhere for you.

doesn't mean "good looker."

[ Chuckles ] Well, I like a woman
who plays hard to get.

probably not gonna take a whole lot

to kick this baby out of neutral.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.028
The only thing great about this night

is that I left the tags on this dress.
