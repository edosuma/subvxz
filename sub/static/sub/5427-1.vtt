WEBVTT

00:52.000 --> 00:56.710
I've got jungle fever
she's got jungle fever

00:56.720 --> 01:00.998
we've got jungle fever
we're in love

01:01.000 --> 01:05.358
she's gone black-boy crazy
I've gone white-girl hazy

01:05.360 --> 01:09.991
ain't no thinking maybe
we're in love

01:18.680 --> 01:22.992
I've gone white-girl crazy
she's gone black-boy hazy

01:23.000 --> 01:27.358
we're each other's baby
we're in love

01:44.760 --> 01:49.470
She can't love me
I can't love her

01:49.480 --> 01:53.553
cause they say
we're the wrong color

01:53.560 --> 01:57.997
staring, gloating
laughing, looking

01:58.000 --> 01:59.752
like we've done something wrong

01:59.760 --> 02:02.195
because we show love strong
get real, come on

02:02.200 --> 02:06.990
calling us names
too bad to mention

02:07.000 --> 02:10.994
but we pay them no attention

02:11.000 --> 02:15.039
for color-blind
are inner feelings

02:15.040 --> 02:18.874
if we feel happiness
and know our love's the best

02:18.880 --> 02:21.713
forget their mess
I've got jungle fever

02:21.720 --> 02:26.715
she's got jungle fever
we've got jungle fever

02:26.840 --> 02:28.194
we're in love

03:12.000 --> 03:16.471
I've got jungle fever
she's got jungle fever

03:16.480 --> 03:20.599
we've got jungle fever
we're in love

03:20.600 --> 03:25.231
she's gone black-boy crazy
I've gone white-girl hazy

03:25.240 --> 03:29.438
ain't no thinking maybe
we're in love

03:38.040 --> 03:42.716
I've gone white-girl crazy
she's gone black-boy hazy

03:42.720 --> 03:48.398
we're each other's baby
we're in love.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.837
Oh, shit.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.996
Right there, right there.
Oh, God, oh.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.990
Don't wake the baby!
Don't wake the baby!

05:38.000 --> 05:40.992
Don't wake the baby!

05:44.320 --> 05:48.632
You know you probably
woke up Ming again.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.756
Why do you always say that?

05:50.760 --> 05:53.195
Because you always wake her up.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.356
I'm not the vocal one, Flipper.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.000
You are. Baby, I can't
believe you said that.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.958
You make too much noise. I love
it, but you make a lot of noise.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.997
I was very quiet.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.991
Ming? Ming!

06:29.000 --> 06:32.356
Come on, Ming-a-ling-a-ling,
you're gonna be late for school.

06:32.360 --> 06:36.035
Wake up.
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

06:36.040 --> 06:41.035
I know you're faking.
I can see your eyes moving.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.957
Last chance.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.840
One, two, three.
That's it.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.992
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.959
Daddy, why did you do that?
Because you were faking.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.759
That's why and
you're gonna be late.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.479
Good morning. How are you? Fine.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.153
How did you sleep?
Fine.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.720
Good, okay.
Put your slippers on.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.998
You go to the bathroom, brush
your teeth and wash your face.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.991
<i>Mommyâ€œ be here
to do your hah...</i>

07:10.000 --> 07:12.310
And this is what
you're gonna wear, okay?

07:12.320 --> 07:14.960
Yes. See you later. High five.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.076
Psych.
That's not fair.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.833
Morning.
Morning.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.798
Good morning, baby. Watch your hand.
Morning.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.952
Daddy, why do you
always hurting Mommy?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.554
Eat your oatmeal.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.439
Mommy's always screaming
like you're hurting her.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.670
Eat your oatmeal, baby.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.194
Honey, you know what?

07:37.200 --> 07:42.195
Remember how we go to school
and feed the pigeons? Yes.

07:42.840 --> 07:47.073
Remember the sparrow was biting
that other sparrow on the booty...

07:47.080 --> 07:48.753
and I said... I remember.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.149
And the squirrels with the
peanuts were biting each other?

07:51.160 --> 07:55.074
- I think so.
- I said it was a spring thing.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.960
I remember.
Mating season.

07:58.960 --> 08:03.955
Well, baby, that's what
your mom and dad are doing.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.680
We're making love.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.594
I know, I was testing you
if you'd tell me the truth.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.830
You knew.
You little smarty.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.751
You are too smart for your age.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.354
- Mommy and Daddy...
- Eat your oatmeal.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.830
You doing it to be doing it or
are you trying to make a baby?

08:20.840 --> 08:24.356
- Eat your oatmeal.
- I would like a baby brother.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.919
So you feel full?

08:25.920 --> 08:29.675
Yeah, that oatmeal is filling.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.832
How do you like it?

08:32.840 --> 08:34.558
I'm kinda tired of oatmeal.

08:34.559 --> 08:39.554
I'm tired of oatmeal myself.
You never eat your oatmeal.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.956
Yeah, 'cause I'm tired of it.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.716
We should have Mommy fix something
different. We should tell her tomorrow.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.030
You think that I don't
know that you be awake.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.999
That you have your door open
every morning, listening.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.753
You're trying to jive me
to think you're asleep.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.354
I know what's going on.
You know that?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.000
Nothing gets past you.
Nothing gets past me.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.196
Okay, baby, here.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.671
I love you so much, mmmm!

09:07.680 --> 09:09.990
Have a nice day, okay?
Okay.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.312
Tell Mrs. Jones I said hello.
Bye,baby. Okay. Bye.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.799
This is fun day

09:22.800 --> 09:24.996
on a fine day

09:25.000 --> 09:27.992
when the air is filled
with tweeting birds

09:28.000 --> 09:30.913
that sing together in the sun

09:30.920 --> 09:32.718
this is your day.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.350
- Where'd you temp before?
- I worked in a law firm.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.920
Could you wait here? Sure.

09:38.920 --> 09:39.910
Hey, Flip.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.993
Good tie, nice ensemble. Very sharp.
Thank you, Jerry.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.957
Leslie, Tony's work is awful.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.999
He's got this elevator shaft six
inches off where it is supposed to be.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.673
We caught that.
Whew!

09:51.680 --> 09:54.957
Listen, we have somebody
we want you to meet.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.840
She comes highly recommended.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.551
This is Angela Tucci. She's
gonna be replacing Terri. Hi.

10:05.560 --> 10:10.270
What? She'll be replacing Terri.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.429
- Glad to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.272
I'm looking forward
to working for you.

10:16.280 --> 10:21.275
We explained to the temp service
how hardworking Terri was.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.874
Said give us the best you got.
And here she is.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.236
Listen, just call me Angie.
I don't like Angela.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.992
Angie it is.
Okay.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.437
You don't have a problem with
this, do you, Flip? No, no.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.990
All right.
She's all yours.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.434
Bye.
Uh...

10:38.440 --> 10:42.399
It went pretty well.
Yeah, of course.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.914
So your name is Angela Tucci?
Yeah.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.915
- You're Italian?
- What else would I be?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.992
And you don't like
to be called Angela.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.992
Angie's fine.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.991
Flip is a nice name.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.709
If you don't mind my asking,
what kind of a name is that?

11:05.720 --> 11:06.994
My father.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.560
If you don't mind me asking,

11:09.560 --> 11:12.074
how long have you been temping?
Since high school.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.914
Have you ever worked in
an architectural firm?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.433
No, I haven't.
But I learn really quick.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.638
I like to learn new things.
I like to be around new people.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.110
- I like people.
- You like people?

11:25.120 --> 11:28.715
I love people.
Uh-huh.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.998
Excuse me just a minute, okay?
Okay.

11:33.320 --> 11:38.156
- Guys, what is this?
- Someone needs a chill pill.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.518
I asked for an African-American
to replace Terri.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.990
You requested an Afro-American?
African-American.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.833
Jerry, you know I did.
I put it in writing.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.877
I didn't see it.
You see it?

11:50.880 --> 11:52.678
If you don't like her,
you send her back.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.992
You tell her you didn't like her
performance because she's white.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.675
What?
That's not the point.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.035
She's been here five minutes,
give her a chance.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.431
This sounds dangerously
like reverse discrimination.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.991
What? This is not
reverse discrimination.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.914
Why is it that I'm the only person
of color working in this office?

12:14.920 --> 12:17.673
Is that discrimination? Why
should we hire someone...

12:17.680 --> 12:21.310
solely on the qualification
of being an African-American?

12:21.320 --> 12:23.118
That's not fair.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.236
We hire who we feel...

12:25.240 --> 12:29.996
is the best human being
for the job.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.000
Fine, fine.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.038
Miss Angela Tucci it is.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.237
I want you to know,
I hope this works out.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.438
Since she likes people.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.436
I think Angie's home.
Dinnertime.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.829
All right, now to the graveyard.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.990
Why can't they kick ass...
Put 'em in the graveyard.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.276
What time is it? The
"N" train broke down.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.317
We're hungry. We're starving.
All right.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.233
How was your day? It was good.
New job.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.753
Fancy place.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.752
I'm glad they got rid of Strawberry.
He was too much trouble.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.993
If he wants his ass kissed, let him
go to I.A. and let Lasorda kiss it.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.277
He says he's a born-again Christian.
Fuck born-again.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.358
Play the fucking game.
We're starving here, Ange.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.000
- You three grown men crippled?
- God forbid.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.719
Do your arms and fingers work?
Don't be mean.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.712
What's to eat, Ange? You cook it.
We'll help.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.280
Yeah, help lift
your fork to your mouth?

13:46.280 --> 13:48.191
Good, huh?
It's good.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.272
No, no, that's plenty.
I'm eating like a fucking pig.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.989
Dad, are we gonna
cuss at the dinner table?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.991
Sorry, sweetheart.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.789
Sorry. I'm still
eating like a pig.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.998
You guys, you should
thank your sister.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.638
For what?
She works hard all day.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.951
Oh, we don't work now! She rushes home.
She cooks for us...

14:09.960 --> 14:12.952
like your mother used to do,
may she rest in peace.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.471
- I like Mommy's cooking better.
- So why don't you cook?

14:17.480 --> 14:19.676
Jimmy, why don't you cook
for the rest of the week?

14:19.680 --> 14:22.115
Jimmy's cooking for the rest of the week.
What's the matter?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.555
You're smart. What's
the matter with you?

14:24.560 --> 14:27.951
Didn't you just hear me say you
should thank your sister? Yeah.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.112
You heard me? Did you
understand what I meant?

14:31.120 --> 14:35.000
I just said it. I was thinking
that and I just said it.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.834
This girl broke her ass for you.
She made a dinner fit for kings.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.990
And "I like Mommy's
cooking better."

14:41.000 --> 14:42.911
Is that nice?
He got no brains.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.993
I want you to apologize
to your sister.

14:47.000 --> 14:47.990
Fucking apologize.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.834
Don't kick my chair. I'll put
this glass in your fucking face.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.150
Why don't you apologize?
Shut the fuck up.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.039
Shut up for ten minutes.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.953
I was telling the truth.
No one cooked like my mother.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.429
- What a fucking life.
- Just eat.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.751
Angie, come on in here.
Sit down and eat.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.991
You got no class. A whole world
affair you're making it into.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.559
That's it. I've had it.
Forget about it.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.552
I'm done. Come and sit down.
Just smack him in the head.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.758
Come and sit down.
Please, Ange.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.870
Flip.
What's up, Cyrus?

15:29.880 --> 15:34.033
You got any gum?
Gum, gum, gum, yeah.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.317
Doublemint.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.038
What's up, man?

15:42.040 --> 15:45.999
Doing my 25 miles...
daily.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.835
What's up with you?
Hey, brother.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.070
I'm just a natural black man
trying to survive...

15:51.080 --> 15:54.471
in a cruel and harsh
white corporate America.

15:54.480 --> 15:59.077
I don't know how you do it.
I don't know how you do it!

15:59.080 --> 16:02.072
Hey, Cody.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.913
How you doing?
What's up, boy?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.480
How you feeling, man? Hi, I'm fine, Vera.
How you doing?

16:07.480 --> 16:10.154
What's Drew up to? She's
downstairs getting ready to cook.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.754
Tell her to give me a call.
All right, bye.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.718
See ya. Come on, Cody,
let's go downstairs.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.996
Whew.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.231
Ohhh.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.312
Vera, how you doing?
Hi, honey.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.679
What are you staring at?

16:31.680 --> 16:34.991
Those birth control pills
enlarging your breasts.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.880
Yeah, did you remember
to pick up that prescription?

16:38.880 --> 16:40.279
I forgot.
I'm sorry.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.953
Oh, you weren't supposed to forget.
I forgot.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.874
When are we having some kids anyway?
I just got my promotion!

16:45.880 --> 16:47.917
It's not an easy job to get.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.514
You promised me
you'd go back to school...

16:50.520 --> 16:53.034
before we had some kids.
That I did.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.919
You make all their money.
Been making all their money.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.116
Their whole Japanese
account is because of me.

16:58.120 --> 17:02.318
They'd be crazy not to do this.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.640
Baby?
What?

17:06.640 --> 17:10.234
I want you to be prepared,
though, all right?

17:10.240 --> 17:12.992
Prepared for what?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.993
Prepared for if they say no.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.958
If they say no?
Look...

17:19.960 --> 17:22.917
No, no. They're not going to say no.
They'd be...

17:22.920 --> 17:25.992
They have no right to say no. I
deserve this. totally crazy.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.991
I've done everything
they've ever asked me to do.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.994
Most of the money they make
is because of me. Totally!

17:32.000 --> 17:33.070
I deserve this.
You do!

17:33.080 --> 17:36.277
They're not going to say no.
Don't think about it. I'm not.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.840
No negative thoughts, right?
That's right.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.751
Right?
That's right.

17:40.760 --> 17:45.152
Positive thoughts. Positive!
I'm so positive.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.913
What do you want, scumbag?

17:59.920 --> 18:04.517
- I'd like to see your sister.
- Angie's not home, Paulie.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.989
Don't try to be slick
and tell me she's not home.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.038
You know and I know
that she's washing dishes.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.350
I want to see Angie now.
Please, come on.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.512
Oh, Angie, it's for you. What?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.832
Hi, Paulie.
Coming out?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.956
Yeah, I ain't washing
the dishes tonight.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.395
The boys are. Charlie's
washing, Jimmy's drying.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.398
That's a change of pace.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.993
Let me go.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.229
Yo, Jimmy?
What?

18:30.240 --> 18:34.996
Prince Charming's here.
Check it out.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.995
Whoa, Paulie. Paulie
Carbone, my man.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.031
What's up?
Hey, Jim.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.997
How you doing?
Good.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.230
Look, Paulie,
we was wanting to know...

18:47.240 --> 18:49.993
if you were fucking our sister.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.640
You fucking my sister?

18:52.640 --> 18:54.790
What kind of question is that?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.279
That's a good question.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.715
It's a stupid question
and I ain't answering it.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.951
If you're fucking my sister,
you better not be.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.633
'Cause you'll get
a fucking beating.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.429
If we ever hear she's not a
virgin, your ass is grass.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.080
You're gonna wish
your mother never had you.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.310
You get her pregnant... Hey!

19:12.320 --> 19:16.075
I don't know why I'm thinking
this, but if you did...

19:16.080 --> 19:18.390
I'm gonna give you
the abortion, Paulie.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.232
Then you're gonna
marry her, okay?

19:20.240 --> 19:23.870
Angela's not some slut.
She's our sister.

19:23.880 --> 19:29.000
Don't even think aboutfi.
Don't even think about it!

19:30.120 --> 19:34.000
You guys.
You guys are sick.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.877
No, we're not sick.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.837
You look like a bum.
What do you got?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.992
Louie's hand-me-downs on?
Tu-eee.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.719
Angie, come out here
and talk to this bum...

19:43.720 --> 19:48.032
before I stomp him into the stoop.
I'm coming.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.031
Whoa. What is this? Prom night?

19:50.040 --> 19:52.998
Go finish watching the game.
Coleman just homered.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.992
Where you going?
Have something to eat.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.992
Where you taking her?
You going with this guy?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.560
Paulie, this doesn't
settle anything.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.915
We'll be waiting, Paulie.
Waiting right here.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.831
You better be careful.
The clock is running.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.639
Don't wait up. We'll
see you in the morning.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.598
Paulie, why don't you say something?
I just did.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.989
Like I'm not a man,
I'm a woman, right?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.435
When my brothers pick on me,
I can deal with it.

20:16.440 --> 20:19.000
When they pick on you,
you grin and take it.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.152
With all due respect, your
brothers are retarded. They are.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.915
I'm serious. Jimmy and Charlie
are definitely retarded.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.196
The poor guys don't even know it.
They don't.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.797
Lucky for you, retardation
isn't hereditary.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.155
Is it? 'Cause it might be.
I don't think so.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.753
No, you could be retarded.

20:36.760 --> 20:41.391
I could be going out with a retarded
girl and I don't even know it.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.995
"Now concerning the things
whereof ye wrote unto me:

20:53.000 --> 20:57.995
"It is good for a man
not to touch a woman.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.839
"Nevertheless,
to avoid fornication...

21:02.840 --> 21:06.799
"let every man have
his own wife...

21:06.800 --> 21:11.636
and every woman
have her own husband."

21:11.640 --> 21:14.792
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Well, well.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.520
I'll get it.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.434
Gator!

21:31.440 --> 21:33.351
Is the good reverend
doctor home?

21:33.360 --> 21:37.149
Can't you tell? Yeah,
there's Mahalia.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.357
Come on in, but please be quiet.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.237
This is your father's
quiet time.

21:42.240 --> 21:46.120
Time for meditation,
time for prayer.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.673
Let me fix you something to eat.
You don't look right.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.114
I look fine.
You been eating?

21:52.120 --> 21:56.671
Like a horse, but I'm not hungry.
I'll just have a candy bar.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.318
That's not good eatin'.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.880
It's quick energy,
sugar, glucose, you know.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.996
I'm cooking you something,
just the same.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.072
You don't look like
you've been eating regularly.

22:06.080 --> 22:10.711
Did I ask you that already?
Mm-hmm.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.996
My mind is getting bad.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.991
Are you on that stuff again?
You promised.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.469
I promise, Mama.
I'm straight, I'm clean.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.278
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.749
You can rest your heart.
That's why I came by here.

22:21.760 --> 22:26.596
I got this great new job,
but there's one catch.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.240
The application calls
for one hundred bucks.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.437
They say I have the job.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.919
But the fee is $100.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.634
Boy, you must think you
have a fool for a mother.

22:36.640 --> 22:41.350
No, I don't! I think I have a
great, understanding mother.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.000
Hush, your foolishness.
I'll pay you back...

22:44.000 --> 22:46.037
with my first check
with interest.

22:46.040 --> 22:51.035
I'm trying, Mama.
It's just a lousy $100.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.994
Don't tell your father.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.118
Lucinda, what is he
doing in our home?

22:59.120 --> 23:03.239
The "he" is your son, our son;
Our first child, Gator.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.880
And I'm fixing him
something to eat.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.315
He is not allowed in our home.

23:08.320 --> 23:13.315
But this is his home too. How
much money did he ask for?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.471
Gator did no such thing.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.996
Go listen to Mahalia while
I get him something to eat.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.231
Now, go on back inside.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.880
Go on.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.113
I take care of Gator.
You go on back.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.756
Gator, dance for me.
Do that new move I like.

23:58.080 --> 24:02.119
Don't forget to call me
<i>as</i> soon as you get that job.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.873
I am of the world.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.075
I have been out there.

24:07.080 --> 24:11.711
The good reverend doctor knows.
The devil's work is never done.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.792
Food's almost ready. The
devil is always busy.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.116
Angie, you can do that
in the morning.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.318
You done enough. That's all right.
I like to work.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.960
You like to what?
I like to work.

24:37.960 --> 24:42.079
Besides, I want my father and
brothers to eat McDonald's tonight.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.994
You want
your father and brothers...

24:46.000 --> 24:47.115
to eat McDonald's?

24:47.120 --> 24:51.990
See, when I get home, I usually
gotta cook and I don't wanna.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.994
So I figure if I don't go home
they're left to their own...

24:56.000 --> 24:58.469
They're grown men.
Why you cooking for them?

24:58.480 --> 25:02.678
It's what they expect
'cause I always do.

25:02.680 --> 25:07.197
I think it's time for them to grow up.
Dig it, dig it.

25:07.200 --> 25:11.194
So you're a good cook?
You can cook, huh?

25:11.200 --> 25:14.670
Yeah, I can cook. I love to cook.
Oh, yeah?

25:14.680 --> 25:17.399
What? What can you cook?
I can cook anything.

25:17.400 --> 25:22.315
- What? Spaghetti?
- Yeah, I can cook spaghetti.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.836
Lasagna? Yeah, lasagna.
You like lasagna?

25:25.840 --> 25:30.835
Ilovelasagna. Oh, yeah?
I'll make lasagna for you.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.560
What? You're gonna
make lasagna for me?

25:34.560 --> 25:37.996
Yeah, I'll make lasagna. I'll make
it at home and bring it in for you.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.992
Why don't I come over and
eat it with your family?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.992
You could try.
I don't know if...

25:44.000 --> 25:47.789
It's a joke.
It's just a joke.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.395
I'm joking.
I know, I know.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.434
Okay.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.479
Shoot, all this talk about food
is making me hungry. Yeah.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.869
Are you hungry?

26:01.960 --> 26:04.110
Yeah.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.079
Where you from?

26:08.080 --> 26:10.276
Bensonhurst.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.999
Bensonhurst?
Mmm.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.276
Nice neighborhood.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.113
Yeah.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.917
Uptown.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.039
The Bronx?
No. Harlem.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.749
Harlem, U.S.A.
Wow.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.991
You ever been there?

26:35.000 --> 26:38.675
No? You've never
been to Harlem?

26:38.680 --> 26:43.470
No, I've never met
anybody from Harlem.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.998
I mean, not in
Bensonhurst anyway.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.152
Well, you know, you should...

26:50.160 --> 26:51.992
You should go.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.995
You'd like it. There's
a lot of nice people there.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.960
Yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.550
Mmm.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.916
- You like it?
- When you put soy sauce on it.

27:12.920 --> 27:16.834
I don't like
the soy sauce so much.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.516
What?

27:23.520 --> 27:27.195
What? What are you looking at?

27:27.600 --> 27:30.991
Wait, don't tell me.
I know.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.472
I know what you're thinking.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.039
You're going,

27:36.040 --> 27:40.910
"Wow! Look at
your skin color,

27:40.920 --> 27:42.593
"How dark it is.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.069
"I love your color complexion.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.993
"I mean, I'm so white,
I'm so pale.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.038
"I get sun now and then when
I hang out at Jones beach.

27:51.040 --> 27:56.114
But nothing like that!"
I hate the beach.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.113
You're definitely
not a mind reader.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.590
I do admit I was looking
at your skin.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.998
Boy, it's amazing,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.959
this preoccupation with color.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.351
I mean here
you are staring at me.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.194
My experiences, my people...

28:23.000 --> 28:26.675
I've been called every...

28:26.680 --> 28:29.991
Black, dot, smut,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.958
midnight, spot.

28:32.960 --> 28:38.194
Every black derogatory name
you could ever think of.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.790
And then white people
comment all the time.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.236
They love it.

28:46.240 --> 28:51.235
It's a deep, dark tan.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.995
Sorry.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.992
It's kind of messed up, huh?

29:00.000 --> 29:04.756
Yeah, it really is.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.994
It's beautiful.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.716
You happy?

29:14.720 --> 29:18.156
Um, we've been going out...

29:18.160 --> 29:20.993
for a long time,
since high school.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.709
How does he treat you?

29:24.720 --> 29:26.836
He's all right.

29:26.840 --> 29:30.231
Just all right?

29:30.240 --> 29:32.390
He's a nice guy.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.119
He's just from the neighborhood.

29:35.120 --> 29:39.000
It's the kind of thing
I'm outgrowing.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.638
Yeah?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.677
I'm just saying, I mean,

29:43.680 --> 29:46.513
you like all these things,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.989
but you're temping.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.038
I think you could be doing
a lot more than that.

29:52.040 --> 29:56.398
Guess it's time to go home, right?
Yeah.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.718
You want any more? No.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.915
Sure?
Positive, positive.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.313
How long does it take you
to get back to Bensonhurst?

30:17.680 --> 30:20.672
Forty, forty-five minutes.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.717
And your...

30:22.720 --> 30:26.998
boyfriend meets you
at the subway station?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.037
No.
No?

30:29.040 --> 30:29.996
No.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.436
What, there's no one
there waiting for you?

30:33.440 --> 30:36.876
Is that safe?
Yeah.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.589
Let me help you with this.
Thank you.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.392
You know, Angie, um...

30:57.400 --> 31:01.792
I've never cheated on
my wife before.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.674
I mean, I'm married.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.035
Happily married.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.593
I know.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.353
I kinda figured that.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.954
Okay?
Yeah.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.190
Wait.
Ohhh.

32:06.400 --> 32:10.280
Take this off.
Ohhh.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.752
What's the matter, Daddy?

33:24.040 --> 33:26.953
Is there something wrong?

33:32.640 --> 33:35.951
How come you're not
talking to me, Daddy?

33:35.960 --> 33:40.750
You're usually full of laughs
and everything.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.755
Bye.

34:12.840 --> 34:16.993
Paulie, how many Daily
News did you order?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.991
Seventy-five.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.958
How many Posts? Fifty.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.951
How many Newsday?

34:23.960 --> 34:27.554
Papa, I order the
same number every day...

34:27.560 --> 34:30.120
and every day you ask me
the same question.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.670
I gotta know. You do know.
It never changes.

34:33.679 --> 34:38.311
You kidding?
Newspapers change every day.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.231
Here.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.072
Eat your breakfast, okay? Yeah.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.233
Call me at lunchtime. I'll
call you at lunchtime.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.996
Okay. All right?
Hey, hey, wait.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.550
You gonna say good-bye
to your mother?

34:52.560 --> 34:54.835
Okay.

35:02.960 --> 35:03.950
Okay.

35:03.960 --> 35:07.999
Call me at lunchtime. I'll
call you at lunchtime.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.036
Lock the door.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.717
Running for your life
by the night.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.916
Running from your wife yipes.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.231
You should have stuck with home.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.991
Turn this shit off!

35:41.000 --> 35:42.752
Hey! It's giving me a headache!

35:42.760 --> 35:44.671
It's P.E.. I don't care!
I don't like it!

35:44.720 --> 35:46.950
Flavor Flav, man. I like it.
I like Madonna.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.110
Madonna's out.
Old! Okay?

35:49.120 --> 35:50.997
Look, I gotta go
inside for a second.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.072
You said we were gonna spend the
day together. We are, okay?

35:54.080 --> 35:55.434
Wait here.
Take me with you.

35:55.440 --> 35:59.513
No, no, all right? Come on, you
always hang out with those goombahs.

35:59.520 --> 36:03.991
Ten minutes. All right.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.230
Hi, Vinny.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.990
What are you talking about?
It harasses me.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.957
I can't tell you nothing.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.590
Paulie, give me another
egg cream, will you?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.951
Every day I see you reading.
What's with this reading?

36:26.960 --> 36:30.510
Some guy makes up some story,
fuck 'em. It's a waste of time.

36:30.520 --> 36:34.309
Tell me one thing that I don't know
that's important from your reading.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.676
Right here, I'm reading
this story right here.

36:37.680 --> 36:41.560
- Yeah, so what?
- I'll tell you what.

36:41.560 --> 36:45.997
These Sicilian guys
in Louisiana had a factory.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.638
It was around 1899...

36:47.640 --> 36:50.996
and they gave the black workers
equal status.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.276
The regular white people
found out and lynched...

36:53.280 --> 36:57.592
the five Italian guys who owned
the factory, that's so what.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.352
Good, they got
what they deserved.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.829
They shouldn't have got
involved with no niggers.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.992
- That's not the point.
- That's my fucking point.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.594
- Give me the money for lotto.
- Put it on my tab.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.719
Give me the money.
Tab, my ass.

37:13.320 --> 37:17.029
Paulie, give me another
chocolate egg cream.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.431
That's five egg creams
you're drinking.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.239
What, does Donna
got you in a state?

37:23.240 --> 37:26.517
I think she's banging
the blond-headed guy.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.990
The one with the big blue
eyes, the pretty boy.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.992
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh pretty boy

37:33.000 --> 37:34.877
I'm only telling ya.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.315
Just 'cause I don't
look like that...

37:37.320 --> 37:39.755
Tall, blond, blue eyes.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.513
That don't mean
I don't feel like that.

37:42.520 --> 37:46.593
What am I?
Some kind of Neanderthal?

37:46.600 --> 37:50.958
These fucking Italian girls.
They're all the same.

37:50.960 --> 37:55.557
You'd think... You'd think
they'd want their own kind.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.791
Nah, nah.
What do they want?

37:58.800 --> 38:02.077
Fucking Robert Redford
they want. Harrison Ford.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.991
They got money, that's why.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.233
Who's that other Wasp?
William Hurt.

38:08.240 --> 38:11.119
White Anglo-Saxon pricks.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.875
Those bums don't know shit
about fucking romance.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.315
Guess who's coming now.
Guess who's coming.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.870
Veeshay, what's up?

38:22.000 --> 38:25.595
Good morning, Paulie. The usual.
Good morning, Orin.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.353
One Daily News for
your parents...

38:28.360 --> 38:29.953
and one Newsday for you.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.789
Yeah, what else? Have you
talked to your father yet?

38:33.800 --> 38:38.795
About what? About the possibility
of getting The Times in here.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.991
- The Sunday Times at least.
- I did.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.870
He says it don't sell. It don't sell, he
don't order. Simple, supply and demand.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.397
- I'll keep trying.
- Thank you.

38:49.400 --> 38:53.951
Here.
Oh, I got something for you.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.913
I picked up that application
from Brooklyn College.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.276
It's a lot of information,

39:02.280 --> 39:04.396
but don't let that scare you.

39:04.400 --> 39:08.030
Thanks for remembering. No problem.
I'll see you later, bye.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.793
Have a good day.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.272
She ain't bad for a black girl.

39:18.920 --> 39:23.994
Enough already, all right?
She's a beautiful girl.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.558
Beautiful. Every
morning the same shit.

39:27.560 --> 39:32.555
I don't believe it. She
looks like Diana Ross.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.073
Paulie, where's my egg cream?

39:34.080 --> 39:37.198
She does. How come we
don't sell Ebony and Jet?

39:37.200 --> 39:39.919
We don't get The
Amsterdam News either.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.833
Yeah, but tell her
you can get copies in Bed-Stuy.

39:42.840 --> 39:47.835
- Tell her to move over there?
- Shut up, Orin is nice people.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.515
You don't know class when you see it.
My ass.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.192
Gentlemen, I, um...

39:57.200 --> 40:00.989
I think we all know
why we're here.

40:01.640 --> 40:06.396
My contribution to this
company's success and growth...

40:06.400 --> 40:08.869
speaks for itself.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.998
Jerry, Leslie, you know
I've worked very hard...

40:12.000 --> 40:14.992
and put in some very long hours.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.799
We know that.
We both know that.

40:17.800 --> 40:22.829
And now I think it's time
for a vertical move.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.995
I have moved as lateral
as I can go.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.310
And I think the
only fair thing to do...

40:29.320 --> 40:34.394
is to accept me
into the position of partner.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.119
Now, I'm not making any demands.

40:38.120 --> 40:42.478
I'm just saying that... You're
not making any demands?

40:42.480 --> 40:45.711
You ask for a partnership?
That's not a demand?

40:45.720 --> 40:48.997
I'm asking what I'm due.
I deserve this.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.311
I'm the next one in line.
And besides, you promised.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.915
We promised in due time. "In
due time" is what we said.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.639
Look, fellows, time is due.

40:58.640 --> 41:02.395
Look, we both understand...

41:02.400 --> 41:04.198
how anxious you are.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.999
And how patient you've been.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.231
But we can't do this now.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.754
Not at this time.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.715
When?

41:17.960 --> 41:20.918
Honestly, I can't say.
I, uh...

41:20.920 --> 41:22.354
You can't say?

41:22.360 --> 41:24.795
Flipper, what is the deal here?
What is...

41:24.800 --> 41:28.759
Is this an issue of money
or is it this new secretary?

41:28.760 --> 41:32.833
It has nothing to do with the secretary.
Don't patronize me. I'm not.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.990
You know that I work very hard.
I work hard too!

41:35.000 --> 41:39.153
I bust my balls, Jerry. I work seven
days a week! I bust my balls too.

41:39.160 --> 41:42.391
How long you been with this company,
Flipper? From the very beginning.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.199
What does that say?
Mast and Covington.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.079
I helped create that.
That's my design up there.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.756
I set up this
goddamn company with...

41:52.760 --> 41:54.990
Still,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.959
we can't do this now.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.993
Well,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.753
that really disappoints me.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.154
Um...

42:13.160 --> 42:18.155
I can see that you have
no respect for me...

42:18.240 --> 42:20.356
or my contribution
to this company.

42:20.360 --> 42:25.355
So you have forced me to turn
in my letter of resignation.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.994
I can see that
I have no future here at...

42:33.000 --> 42:35.992
Mast and Covington.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.434
Gentlemen, have a nice day.

42:37.440 --> 42:41.354
- Come on, Flipper, come on.
- Let him go.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.959
Quiet.
Flipper, come on.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.032
You don't have to...
Don't walk away like this.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.316
There's nothing left to talk about.
Let him go.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.789
Look at this. This is my work.
Mine, mine, mine.

42:50.800 --> 42:54.555
You know what your problem is? Your
ego's out of control. Lighten up.

42:54.560 --> 42:59.999
Come on, who's gonna play third
base for us? I don't give a damn.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.194
Look, we spent a long... Mine!

43:04.200 --> 43:06.191
Okay.
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

43:06.200 --> 43:08.510
Ego, ego, ego.
Come on, quiet.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.990
Don't tell me to be quiet.
I'm telling you to be quiet.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.833
What's his problem? It's been too...
We've, we've...

43:14.840 --> 43:17.559
We've worked
together too long...

43:17.560 --> 43:21.519
to end a relationship like this.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.954
Let's just cool down
and talk about this.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.995
All we're asking for
is a little bit more patience.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.958
We don't have any more patience.

43:41.960 --> 43:46.830
Fine. If you're
that unhappy here,

43:46.840 --> 43:48.751
Q0.

43:48.760 --> 43:53.516
Come on. We don't
have to deal with this.

43:56.600 --> 44:00.150
Look, I'm really sorry.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.956
- So you quit?
- I resigned.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.959
Good move. You need to start your own firm.
We need our own businesses.

44:07.960 --> 44:10.270
- Exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Let me ask you a question.

44:10.280 --> 44:14.751
Why are we out here tonight?
In this park late at night?

44:14.760 --> 44:17.798
- What's the problem?
- Why are we out here?

44:17.800 --> 44:22.397
You've got to promise me you're
not going to tell anybody.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.871
Who am I gonna tell?
I don't say nothing to nobody.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.712
I-I-I-I-I nothing.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.916
You got to promise me.
I know you, Cyrus.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.151
My lips are sealed.
What happened?

44:34.160 --> 44:36.959
<i>'U.</i>

44:36.960 --> 44:40.112
I cheated on Drew
for the first time.

44:40.120 --> 44:44.398
You did that? When did this happen?
The other day.

44:44.400 --> 44:48.109
Yeah? I thought you
were going to drop a bomb.

44:48.120 --> 44:51.317
Well, uh...

44:51.320 --> 44:52.958
She's white.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.317
You're crazy.
She's Italian.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.914
- H-bomb.
- From Bensonhurst.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.878
Nuclear megaton bomb.

45:02.880 --> 45:07.716
- I know you didn't bone her.
- No, no, no. Uh-uh.

45:07.720 --> 45:11.998
Know you got better judgment than that.
Right, I do.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.560
My man, that's right.
I didn't. Good.

45:14.560 --> 45:17.518
I'm glad you didn't bone her.
Nope, no.

45:17.520 --> 45:22.390
You could have, but you didn't.
No, no.

45:22.400 --> 45:25.119
She put it in your face,
but you refused...

45:25.120 --> 45:29.353
'cause you are strong, you're
a strong black man. Strong.

45:29.360 --> 45:32.637
Strong black man who...

45:32.640 --> 45:34.438
I threw her on the table.

45:34.440 --> 45:39.435
Oh, Flip, you did.
You boned her.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.352
And I was...

45:41.360 --> 45:43.271
You promised, you promised.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.750
Nuclear holocaust.
Hey, man,

45:46.760 --> 45:47.989
it just happened.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.709
I got a bad feeling
about this one, bad feeling.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.199
What's so important?

45:53.200 --> 45:56.989
I'm to go out with Vinny. What'd you
get us here for? What's going on?

45:57.000 --> 46:00.994
You gonna finally have a wedding?
No... I don't know.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.674
But you're wearing that ring.
Why do you look so happy?

46:03.680 --> 46:06.194
This isn't about Paulie.
She's got that glow.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.953
I'm not glowing.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.314
So what is it?
What's going on?

46:10.360 --> 46:14.319
All right, but you gotta swear.
This is like swearing on Bibles.

46:14.320 --> 46:18.518
Swearing on rosary beads. I swear
on my great grandmother, okay?

46:18.520 --> 46:20.079
We swear, we swear, what?

46:20.080 --> 46:23.994
- I'm seeing somebody.
- Yeah, you two-timing?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.992
- Who are you seeing?
- Somebody from work.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.312
That new job. That was quick.
A very fancy place.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.960
So what's he look like?
Who is this guy?

46:33.960 --> 46:36.634
- What's his name?
- It's a weird name.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.233
- Try me.
- Flipper.

46:38.240 --> 46:41.995
Flipper? What the fuck kind
of name is Flipper? Flipper?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.833
I told you it's a weird name.
Don't laugh.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.753
And what is he?
Blond, blue-eyed surfer type?

46:47.760 --> 46:50.229
Hey, dude.
Right? What is that?

46:50.240 --> 46:54.120
He's black.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.356
Something wrong with your face?
Black?

46:57.360 --> 47:00.318
You did it with a black guy?
Yeah.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.709
If your father ever found out.
I don't know.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.394
He's not gonna.
Of course not.

47:05.400 --> 47:08.358
Not from us.
I'm just saying keep it quiet.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.998
Look at Gina.
Gina who?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.992
She brought that guy into the
neighborhood, that black guy.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.994
Look what they did to him. What you talking
about that Puerto Rican crackhead for?

47:17.000 --> 47:20.709
She brought him into the neighborhood
and they killed the guy.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.119
You better be careful.

47:22.120 --> 47:25.033
I don't think she's stupid
enough to bring him in.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.793
Whatever.
Our lips are sealed.

47:27.800 --> 47:31.759
Personally, I think
it's disgusting.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.991
Really? Yeah, I
think it's gross.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.911
How could you... Hey.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.797
Me, myself, personally,
I could never.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.997
You're not sleeping with
the guy. What do you care?

47:42.000 --> 47:43.673
I just think
she's a beautiful girl.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.832
She can have any guy. Why does
she have to go with a moolie?

47:46.840 --> 47:48.399
I mean, Jesus Christ.
I mean...

47:48.400 --> 47:53.395
This is the '90s. There's nothing wrong
with it. You having a good time?

47:54.840 --> 47:59.835
I have to admit I've been
curious about Caucasian women.

48:00.280 --> 48:04.831
That doesn't mean to say that white is
right and sisters aren't beautiful.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.956
Sisters are beautiful too.

48:06.960 --> 48:10.351
But, hey, I was curious.

48:10.360 --> 48:13.955
So ljustjumped on it.

48:13.960 --> 48:18.079
- Literally.
- Yes, indeedy.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.598
I mean, hey, hey,
that doesn't mean to say...

48:23.600 --> 48:26.069
that because a brother
is with a white girl...

48:26.080 --> 48:29.277
that he's less down,
I mean, less progressive.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.989
- I'm still very pro-black.
- You're black all right.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.037
My shit is correct,
very correct.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.395
You got a big problem.
You and her.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.994
The both of youse got the fever.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.469
- The what?
- The fever.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.994
The both of youse
got jungle fever.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.513
The both of youse.

48:46.520 --> 48:50.673
Soon as we get some money we're going
straight back to that motherfucking house.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.478
Straight back.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.950
Babe bro, come on, baby.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.949
Nigger, don't push on me. This is
the bitch with the golden halo.

48:59.960 --> 49:03.032
He done stepped right off
into the cash money thing.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.316
Mr. Flip man.

49:05.320 --> 49:09.314
Yo, babe bro. Cyrus.
Black men.

49:09.320 --> 49:13.200
Successful and shit. I want
you to meet my new woman, Viv.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.636
That's short for Vivian.
She's good people.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.631
I like her.
Mmmmm!

49:18.640 --> 49:22.110
I was most fortunate to make
her acquaintance recently.

49:22.120 --> 49:25.556
That's my baby brother, the one
I've been telling you about.

49:25.560 --> 49:30.555
He a architect and shit.
And that's his main man, Cyrus.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.991
He a, uh...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.799
Damn, what is it you do again?

49:35.800 --> 49:38.952
I teach high school.
Damn, that's right.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.951
He a high school teacher
and shit.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.270
Hey, I'm sorry.
My mind's getting bad.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.749
I gotta go.
You leaving me?

49:45.760 --> 49:47.353
I gotta go.

49:47.360 --> 49:51.035
You promised. I promise.
My lips are sealed.

49:51.040 --> 49:55.034
Vivian, nice to meet you.
Gator, peace, two fingers.

49:55.040 --> 49:59.511
Peace. Viv, let two loving
brothers get a moment alone...

49:59.520 --> 50:02.194
to get reacquainted and shit?

50:02.200 --> 50:04.953
Where am I to go? I don't
give a fuck where.

50:04.960 --> 50:08.954
Sit in a fucking swing and wait for me.
A swing? It's cold!

50:08.960 --> 50:11.952
I'm trying to get motherfucking
money from my brother.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.110
What do I look like?
A fool?

50:14.120 --> 50:15.952
Put this in your mouth.
Smoke this shit.

50:15.960 --> 50:19.191
Give me a motherfucking light.
Take this goddamn lighter.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.919
Carry your motherfucking ass over
on that swing. Hurry your ass.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.309
Get the fuck over there. You
better come back with money.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.357
Hurry up.
Motherfucker. Shit.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.998
Go, go, go.
It's cold out here.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.560
I don't give a fuck if you
freeze your motherfucking ass.

50:30.560 --> 50:35.350
I'm tired of waiting on your
motherfucking ass. Shit.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.910
Oh, I like her.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.433
Mmm.

50:40.440 --> 50:41.999
Look here, baby brother.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.870
I'm a little light. Could you
let me hold some change?

50:46.880 --> 50:51.317
No. No, Gator. That dancing
shit ain't gonna work.

50:51.320 --> 50:53.152
I ain't giving you a red cent.

50:53.160 --> 50:56.596
What? Come on, you can
do me this one solid.

50:56.600 --> 51:00.639
Would you rather I go out
and rob some elderly person?

51:00.640 --> 51:01.960
Steal?

51:01.960 --> 51:04.395
Either way, I'm gonna get high.

51:04.400 --> 51:09.395
I hate to resort to knocking elderly
people in the head for their money.

51:10.560 --> 51:15.396
But I'll do it. I'll do it.
You know I'll do it.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.789
'Il do it I'll do it.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.791
You know I'll do it

51:19.800 --> 51:23.316
like getting high.

51:23.320 --> 51:27.279
Cause I'm a... crackhead

51:27.280 --> 51:30.352
<i>I</i> like to get high

51:30.360 --> 51:34.399
I'm a... crackhead.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.991
My brother.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.991
Tch. Yeah. Yo, Viv.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.233
I'm not doing this anymore.
Come on, let's go.

51:43.240 --> 51:46.790
That's it, Gator.
That's it.

51:46.800 --> 51:51.590
I got 50 fucking dollars.
Fifty dollars!

51:51.600 --> 51:54.035
That's right.
Get off me!

51:54.040 --> 51:57.237
Ladies, we have one
chicken livers and onions...

51:57.240 --> 52:00.551
with candied yams
and collard greens;

52:00.560 --> 52:04.519
And one Sylvia's world-famous
talked-about ribs special...

52:04.520 --> 52:07.273
with potato salad and
black-eyed peas? Right.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.998
Two iced teas?
Thank you.

52:09.000 --> 52:14.074
Can I get you anything else?
No, that's fine.

52:20.760 --> 52:24.071
I really should have
done this a long time ago.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.959
Break away and start
my own business.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.315
You still going to work
at Mast and Covington?

52:29.320 --> 52:31.994
I'm a temp secretary, remember?

52:32.000 --> 52:34.310
Yeah. Damn it.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.357
<i>Excuse me, miss, miss.</i>

52:36.360 --> 52:37.759
May we order, please?

52:37.760 --> 52:42.516
Yes, may I take your order?
Is this your station?

52:42.520 --> 52:44.158
Yes, this is my station.
Unfortunately.

52:44.160 --> 52:49.030
You could have taken my order 30 minutes
ago when I sat my black ass in this chair.

52:49.040 --> 52:51.998
Can I take your order?

52:52.000 --> 52:53.991
Excuse me,
do you have a problem?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.389
Yes, I do have a problem,
to be honest with you.

52:56.400 --> 53:00.871
Fake, tired brothers like you
coming in here. That's so typical.

53:00.880 --> 53:03.030
I can't believe you brought...

53:03.040 --> 53:06.396
her stringy-haired ass up here.

53:06.400 --> 53:07.799
It's not your business...

53:07.800 --> 53:10.553
who I bring in here. Parade
your white meat somewhere else.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.713
It's not your business. You are a waitress.
Your job is to wait.

53:14.720 --> 53:18.429
Today's specials are
the Maryland crab cakes,

53:18.440 --> 53:22.354
Creole shrimp gumbo
and blackened catfish.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.795
I suggest you have
the blackened catfish.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.199
I suggest you find the manager.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.237
You want my manager?
I want your manager.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.039
It's like that, right?
I want the manager.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.316
Fine, I'll get my manager.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.994
You're fired.
You're tired.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.560
She's white.
Mm-hmm.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.995
I love her.
She's great.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.915
We have a great marriage,
a great daughter.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.513
What does she do?

53:47.520 --> 53:51.400
She's a buyer
for Bloomingdale's.

53:52.920 --> 53:56.390
So what are we doing?

53:56.400 --> 54:00.997
I honestly don't know.

54:03.520 --> 54:06.433
I guess I don't expect
you to leave her.

54:06.440 --> 54:09.034
Well, I'm not.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.680
So then what are we doing?

54:11.680 --> 54:14.991
I don't think
we're just fooling around.

54:17.200 --> 54:21.558
All right, is it true black men
don't like to go down on women?

54:21.560 --> 54:24.996
Come on, you heard that, right?

54:25.000 --> 54:26.991
No, no. Don't tell me
you didn't hear that.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.879
Untruth, untruth.
That's like white boys...

54:29.880 --> 54:32.474
have little
mini-frosted Wheaties dicks.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.996
Why? Is that true? I don't know.
You tell me.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.719
I don't know.
It's not true.

54:38.720 --> 54:41.394
Of course not.
It's a myth. I think.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.835
Take it!
Take all his stuff.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.990
You just take it.
Take everything.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.435
Cyrus, leave his stuff alone.
You let them take it.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.990
Take all his stuff, his papers,
blueprints, board, clothes.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.230
Take them on home. Y'all take them.
Hey!

54:54.240 --> 54:57.676
Drew! Drew! I don't want it in my house.
Get it outta here.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.877
Hey, give me that back.
Drew, what did I do?

55:00.880 --> 55:03.918
Don't give it back
to him, Cyrus!

55:03.920 --> 55:06.275
You take it.
What did I do?

55:06.280 --> 55:07.998
Put that back!
Drew!

55:08.000 --> 55:11.959
I don't want it in my house. Why
are you throwing my papers out?

55:11.960 --> 55:13.598
Drew, what did I do?

55:13.600 --> 55:16.672
- Tell me what I did.
- You're a liar and bastard.

55:16.680 --> 55:20.514
A what? A bastard and
a liar, you fuckhead.

55:20.520 --> 55:23.911
What is she talking about?
She's hip to Angie.

55:23.920 --> 55:27.117
Throw out the refrigerator.
Wait, wait.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.997
Drew, listen, listen.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.355
Hey, Mommy.
I can explain.

55:31.360 --> 55:35.991
Explain? Explain a fucking
white bitch you're fucking.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.834
Vera, take Ming upstairs
to your apartment.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.478
Take her to your apartment!

55:41.480 --> 55:43.756
Don't talk to her.
That's my friend.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.957
Don't talk to her. Fuck you!
Don't listen to him.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.873
Do we have to discuss
this in front of Harlem?

55:49.880 --> 55:52.952
Why do we have to discuss this
in front of all of Harlem?

55:52.960 --> 55:56.157
We <i>don't</i> have <i>shit</i> to <i>discuss.
Discuss that!</i>

55:56.160 --> 56:00.040
What am I gonna do
about the business?

56:00.040 --> 56:01.599
Oh, fuck your fucking business.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.399
I'm gonna use the house as my office.
Oh, fuck you.

56:04.400 --> 56:07.313
You better get
a new house then, asshole.

56:07.320 --> 56:10.950
Give me this.
Get off of it.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.270
Look, baby.

56:16.200 --> 56:21.991
There will be
no penis between us.

56:24.440 --> 56:26.875
Asshole.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.352
We can talk this out.

56:29.360 --> 56:33.319
I know we can talk this out.

57:00.640 --> 57:05.635
Let us pray. Heavenly Father,
make us truly thankful...

57:05.880 --> 57:08.759
for this of thy bounty
which we are about to receive...

57:08.760 --> 57:10.990
for the nourishment
of our bodies.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.279
In the name of thy son, Jesus.
Amen. Amen.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.277
So...

57:18.280 --> 57:20.954
you have been cast
out of your home...

57:20.960 --> 57:25.955
like Jonah was cast out
of the belly of the whale.

57:25.960 --> 57:28.873
I pray adultery
was not the cause?

57:28.880 --> 57:32.999
- It's complex.
- Let the boy eat his meal.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.119
You don't have to answer. I know
you and Drew will work this out.

57:37.120 --> 57:42.115
Was it the temptation of the sweet
nectar of another woman's fruit?

57:43.280 --> 57:45.590
The devil is always at work.

57:45.600 --> 57:48.672
People are responsible
for their own actions, Dad.

57:48.680 --> 57:50.353
The devil had little,
if anything, to do with it.

57:50.360 --> 57:54.354
It was thinking like that that led
you from the straight and narrow.

57:54.360 --> 57:59.036
Do you ever just talk?
Let him who is without sin...

57:59.040 --> 58:00.872
cast the first stone.

58:00.880 --> 58:04.271
Straight and narrow?
Not you, not me...

58:04.280 --> 58:06.999
and definitely not you.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.435
You and me come from the
same crooked straits.

58:09.440 --> 58:12.000
That's the end
of this conversation.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.992
Go get your wife back.
You both need each other.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.718
And Ming needs the both of you.

58:16.720 --> 58:21.999
Please, let's eat
this meal in peace.

58:27.720 --> 58:31.998
Mmm! She ain't nothin'
but a low-class...

58:32.000 --> 58:34.389
white trash.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.993
She probably didn't even
finish high school.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.914
You know that's the truth.
That's what he left me for.

58:39.920 --> 58:41.957
I always thought Flipper
was the ideal husband.

58:41.960 --> 58:45.271
You can never tell.
They're all dogs!

58:45.280 --> 58:47.635
I promise you, they're all dogs!

58:47.640 --> 58:49.119
Every last one.
That's right.

58:49.120 --> 58:51.953
We gonna have to start datin' white men.
Stop it, Nilda.

58:51.960 --> 58:53.951
It's true. I'm not
datin' no white man.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.952
It ain't no good black men out there.
Yes, there are.

58:56.960 --> 59:00.840
Most of them are
drug addicts, in jail, homos...

59:00.840 --> 59:04.151
The good ones know they the shit
so they got ten women at a time,

59:04.160 --> 59:07.676
- leaving babies all over.
- My marriage is wrecked.

59:07.680 --> 59:10.513
It's fucked up; The man is gone.
He's fucking some white bitch...

59:10.520 --> 59:12.989
and I still believe there's
good black men out there.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.799
Where?
What are the options?

59:15.800 --> 59:17.598
Be a nun, be gay... You
know what the options are?

59:17.600 --> 59:22.595
Or see somebody who likes you no matter
what... Chinese, black, white, whatever.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.712
Exactly. You're as wrong
as the day is long.

59:24.720 --> 59:28.953
They're out there. The problem is
we're lookin' in the wrong places.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.076
We're looking someplace... I
don't know where we're looking,

59:31.080 --> 59:35.995
but we're not lookin' at bus drivers, truck
drivers, a lot of them are doing that.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.994
We just won't give 'em the time
of day, but they're good men.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.997
How many men do you know...
Black men...

59:42.000 --> 59:46.995
Who can effectively deal with a mate who
has more education and makes more money?

59:47.000 --> 59:48.991
Not many. They freak.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.913
- I know there are.
- The fact remains...

59:51.920 --> 59:53.831
that we are losing our men;
That's the bottom line.

59:53.840 --> 59:56.309
A lot of this doesn't have
so much to do with black men.

59:56.320 --> 59:59.756
I know it does, we want to blame
them, and it is their blame.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.957
Part of it is that white bitches
throw themselves at black men.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.913
Do you see the way they look at 'em?
That's true.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.639
You can't walk down the street
with your man...

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.996
without 29,000 white bitches
comin' onto 'em.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.514
They will give up their pussy
because their fathers...

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.079
tried to keep it from them
all their lives.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.152
When they turn 18 and leave home
they gonna get that black dick.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.835
Hey gonna get it. It can be
yours, yours, or mine...

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.990
and they want it,
and they're gettin' it.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.991
Deal with the black man
for a minute.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.356
There's a lot of self-hate goin' on
when he can't deal with his sister.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.079
How would you know?
You won't deal with a black man.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.075
I do date black men; But I also date Chinese,
Latino, Jewish... the full spectrum.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.875
That's not a consolation
for this particular argument...

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.359
that we're having.
It's not supposed to be.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.876
You think I should date black men,
but I'm gonna date who I like.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.951
Give me a man,
regardless of color,

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.716
who is nice to me, sweet to me
and who I believe loves me.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.396
Inez, I'm not the
rainbow-fucking kind.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.313
You are the leading
rainbow girl.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.994
We know this about you.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.992
If it will make you happy, I'll
make a pilgrimage to Africa...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.389
the motherland, and find
myself a true tribesman.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.394
- A true Asiatic black man.
- With a dick down to his knees,

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.869
to keep me happy for days.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.109
Oooh! Zulu dick!
That's right, girl.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.717
- I'm gonna get serious Zulu dick in the bush.
- What a nasty!

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.996
Do any of you know
what it is like...

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.070
not being thought of
as attractive?

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.075
I can't believe you believe that!
It's the kind of shit you buy into.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.033
I was always the darkest one
in my class.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.599
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.991
All the guys ran after the light-skinned
girls with long, straight hair.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.118
That left me out. It's that
same kind of thinkin'...

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.350
that leaves us out when
it comes to white women.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.355
Back in the day, brothers would
get sisters that looked like you.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.990
But now, light skin
ain't even good enough.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.037
Today, brothers are
going for the gusto...

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.998
I mean the real McCoy.
That's why Flipper's gone.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.071
- White girls got it made.
- The whole thing...

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.075
Everything in society... we keep
doin' the same thing over and over;

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.638
We keep telling ourselves,
negatin' ourselves.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.718
Look at them! Most of the
brothers who have made it...

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.075
got white women on their arms.
That's true.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.720
In order to go up that ladder
to success, seems like...

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.439
you got to have "Miss
Thing" on your arm. Mm-hmm!

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.193
Their responsibility level
isn't the same as ours.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.999
It's not even a question
of responsibility.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.389
It's a fundamental disrespect for women.
Yes, it is.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.597
I don't care, the best man...
It's hard for him to say no,

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.999
some pussy starin' him
in the face.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.153
I'm sorry. I don't know the man that's
been born that's gonna say no...

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.596
He look around, nobody here...
He gonna fuck the pussy.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.716
If you want
a committed relationship,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.435
It's the "art of no" theory
for me.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.317
If you know you're involved
with this person,

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.596
you have no business... I don't believe...
Look around.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.319
I know there's such...
You gonna get turned on.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.756
You gonna see somebody you wanna fuck,
but your mind's supposed to tell you,

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.116
I have a committed relationship,
I have a wife, whatever.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.875
And tell the dick to shut
the fuck up and get down.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.271
Strap that motherfucker down!
You know? Come on.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.989
You're right.
You have to.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.752
You know somethin', though?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.311
It don't even matter
what color she is.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.676
My man is gone.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.870
Nah, Flipper.
Nah.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.034
I wanna talk to Drew. There's a war
council goin' on in your living room.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.509
Where's Ming?

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.990
Asleep upstairs with us.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.159
Let's take a walk.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.950
How did Drew bust me?

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.998
Don't tell me it was because
you opened your big mouth.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.994
Goddamn, C.
I trusted you!

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.035
You see what happens?

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.716
If I can't tell my wife, who can I tell?
Nobody, nobody, nobody!

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.950
Nobody, nobody!

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.997
I told you...
don't tell a soul.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.991
You promised me.
You 4-1-1 or somethin'?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.436
How was I supposed to know
Vera was gonna tell Drew?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.229
I didn't know that shit. Use your
better judgment, that's how.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.993
She is a woman.
All women stick together.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.673
They always do and always will.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.433
Now I'm thrown out of my house
because of your silly,

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.593
no-keepin'-a secret,
married-to-a-blabbermouth wife!

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.513
Don't talk about my wife.
You need a place to stay,

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.397
you can stay with us
<i>as</i> long as you want.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.596
Just say the word, but
don't talk about my wife.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.595
Yeah, right. Right!
And be spied on all night?

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.673
I'd rather live
with the F.B.l. and C.l.A.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.950
She would be giving her an
on-the-hour report...

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.474
of everything I did to Drew.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.869
Miss... big mouth!

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.998
Hey, did big mouth say
go fuck that lady?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.230
We had nothin' to do
with that shit.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.030
Put the fuckin' blame on
the blamee... you, not me.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.997
That's right.
Why you laughin'?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.630
'Cause you fucked me up,
that's why I'm laughin'.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.439
I didn't mean that shit. Ho-ho.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.159
You gotta place to stay. So
your marriage's fucked up.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.356
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.
Fuck you.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.751
It was a mistake.
I shouldn't have told her.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.479
She has a big, fuckin' mouth.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.433
While the night is young

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.997
and the stars are out

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:07.515
and your eyes are all aglow.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.557
Excuse me, miss.
Can you help me, please?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.233
Flipper, why are you here?

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.790
Drew, these are for you.
I don't want them.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.593
I need to talk. I don't
want to talk to you.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.035
All right.
Sorry.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.035
Not out here, please. In my office.
All right.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.995
Look, baby, I know you're upset,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.756
but... I guess I just wasn't
light enough for you, was I?

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.355
You had to eventually
go get yourself a white girl.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.718
Eventually? What I mean is you
got a complex about color.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.950
You've always had it.
I never wanted to believe it.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:54.716
All the girls you ever dated have been
light-skinned girls... you and Cyrus, both of you.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.712
You don't know what type of women
I dated before we got together.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.918
That's not the issue. The issue is 'cause
you're so black, you have a problem.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.833
That's insane! That's insane!
Yes. Yes!

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.037
I've told you what happened
to me when I was growin' up.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.714
I've explained to you.
I've poured my heart out.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.599
I told you how they called me
high yellow, yellow bitch.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.353
White honky, honky white;
White nigger, nigger white;

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.036
Octoroon, quadroon, half-breed, mongrel...
and what do you do?

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.556
Do you love this girl?
Ohh! Oh, Drew.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.996
You've gotta be kidding me.
Do you love her?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.995
- I love you.
- Do you love her?

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.317
No, no, no!

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.789
No, I don't.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.839
I'm so glad for you.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.194
So glad.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.033
'Cause don't you know white
people hate black people...

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.396
'cause they're not black?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.629
They can't relate.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.679
Look, Drew, did your white
father hate your black mother?

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.557
You talkin' about my family?

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.871
This is what I'm saying.
Color's got you fucked up, too.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.633
Maybe it has!
Maybe it has!

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.998
Maybe that's why this hurts me so much.
Can't you see that?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.994
I trusted you.
I...

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.436
- And I loved you.
- And you still do.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.636
Oh, please,
don't tell me what I feel!

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.993
I don't.
And I won't again.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.437
Take your tired-ass roses and get the
fuck out of my place of business.

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:28.435
Love can be so insecure

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.798
so please

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.953
be sure.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:54.279
- Can you lend me Starbursts?
- Some Now-And-Laters, too?

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.510
I'm gonna lend it to you?
What am I, a library?

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.273
Come on, get out. I told
you I was closed. Come on.

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.920
Just 'cause I'm a nice guy...
Come on, Paulie.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.196
I seen that.
Come on, man.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.113
Get out. Out! Hey, come on.
You're a Cheapskate.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.317
I can't help it.
It's my nature.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.996
Ohhh!

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.073
- You want another egg cream?
- No.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.598
Boy, it seems like forever
since I seen ya.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.193
Where ya been?

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.953
Oh, just...
been doin' things.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.109
You want another egg cream? No.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.000
Sure?
Yeah.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.435
Paulie, sit down.
All right.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:45.716
We've been goin' out
for a long time, Paulie.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.029
Yeah.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.350
Look...

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:54.991
I care about you too much
to bullshit you.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:02.155
But, uh, I need to get away
from here as far as possible.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.718
I just...
I wanna get out of here.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.600
I don't understand.
You movin' or somethin'?

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.989
Oh.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.150
Paulie.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.757
Paulie...
please.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.789
What is this about?

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.990
This is about something else.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.753
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me? Stop.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.360
- Yeah?
- Is your watch broken?

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.830
I know what time it is. I
haven't eaten for ten hours!

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.838
Know you're hungry. I'm starving,
you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.470
Know you haven't eaten since lunch.
What am I, on a diet?

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.472
All right.
I'll be up in a bit.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.873
Lou's hungry.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.150
Open the door.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.879
Paulie?

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.712
Let me in.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.873
No.
Paulie?

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.952
I gotta pee.
No, you don't!

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.510
Leave me alone.
You just want to get in here.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.118
Paulie, I'm gonna
pee in my pants.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.353
Open the fuckin' door!
I gotta take a leak!

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.991
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.269
What's the matter with you?
What the hell are you doin'?

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.796
You lied! You said
you had to take a leak.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.430
Locking yourself in the john
like a little girl!

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.511
All because of some skirt.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.036
Not some skirt. It's Angie.
She's a woman.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.429
You call that a woman!

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.195
I was married to
a real woman... your mother.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.679
That was a woman!

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.991
- I wanted to marry Angie.
- She did you a big favor.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.594
Marriage to her
would have been hell.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.991
Besides, marriage
to her is a joke.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.991
People get married,
divorced, married.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.197
All they think
marriage is for is humping.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.192
- They don't know the duties.
- What duties?

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.237
Wifely duties.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.995
Those kind of women are rare.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.153
Your mother and me,
we had our wars.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:14.633
She didn't talk to me
for almost... two years.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.957
Not... Not a word.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.238
Still, she scrubbed my back.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.995
Never stopped doin' her duties.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.356
That woman was there for me.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.990
Till death do us part.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.437
That...
was a fuckin' marriage.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.555
Sometimes when I'm alone,
she says to me,

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.277
â€œLou.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.352
Me."

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.270
But I...

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.874
I try.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.834
But I can't find her lips.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.991
When was the last time

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.675
that they heard you say

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.718
mother or father

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.758
love you

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.391
when was the last time
that they heard you say.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.074
A nigger! A nigger!

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.640
A nigger! What kind of woman...
Daddy!

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.315
What kind of a woman are you?
You fuck a black nigger?

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.075
I didn't raise you to be with no nigger!
I'd rather you be a murderer...

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.596
Jimmy! Charlie! or a child
molester than fuck a black nigger!

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.036
What's goin' on? What'd you do?
Get back!

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.600
I'm telling ya to get back.
Don't do it!

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.989
It's none of your
fucking business.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.358
You! Your mother's turning over
in her grave. Stop, Daddy!

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.317
This is how you scar
your mother's memory?

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.996
I raised you to be a good Catholic girl.
You're a disgrace!

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.991
No! No!
You're a disgrace!

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.038
Pop, what're you doin'?
Stop!

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.112
You're a disgrace to the Italians!
You're a disgrace!

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.316
You could've gone out
with a Jew or Irishman,

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.994
but you picked a fucking nigger!
Calm down.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.640
I wish your mother had lived
and you had died.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.350
Let go of me! Get off me!
Calm down.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.993
I'd rather stab myself
in the heart with a knife...

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.153
than be the father
of a nigger lover.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.993
As far as I'm concerned...

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.594
Look at all you people.
What the fuck you lookin' at?

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.399
Why don't you mind
your goddamn business!

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.960
Knowing you didn't always show.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.955
Just how much you loved him so

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.997
these three words

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.718
sweet and simple Hi, Frankie.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.236
Why don't you come inside?
Come on, let's go.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.272
- Hey, Paulie.
- Denise, just stay here.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.715
Okay.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.317
Hey, Paulie. How ya doing, Paulie?
All right.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.596
Paulie, how's you r father?
Okay.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.352
Don't take too long, Vinny.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.036
I need an egg cream.
He's a nice kid.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.631
Paulie, we know.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.234
You know.
We all know.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.835
You're a jerk-off
most of the time,

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.797
but I feel for you.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.995
A colored?
A spook?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.038
A spearchucker?
Jesus Christ, a fuckin' eggplant.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:46.113
You know, Paulie,
Jew girls do that all the time.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.589
But I would have
thought better of Angela.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.319
She went to Catholic school
for eight years.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.996
- That's 16 years, you moron!
- It's a fuckin' mystery.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.198
- You gonna give her a beatin'?
- Her father did that already.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.510
I'm not talkin' about her father.
I'm talkin' about you.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.558
He ain't talkin' about Mike.
He's talkin' about you.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.153
See my girl, Denise.
She knows better.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.994
She got out of line one time,
I stomped her in the midsection.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.992
Morning, Paulie.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.235
Good morning.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.953
How are ya?
Ah.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.600
Just okay?
The same.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.716
All right.
I'll see you later.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.631
Have a nice day.
You, too.

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.439
Have a nice day.
Thank you.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.356
Ooh, she's sweet, man.
I'd fuck her.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.671
- Definitely.
- You'd fuck a mozzarella.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.991
I'd fuck her. I'd fuck a
nigger or spic in a second.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.992
- Yeah... and the mozzarella.
- I'd do it, too.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.037
I wouldn't let anyone see us
together. No way I'd walk...

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.431
down 18th avenue with a black
on my arm, no fuckin' way.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.398
Not even Paula Abdul?
Not even Paula Abdul.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.995
- Abdul says she's not black.
- Who's Paula Abdul?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.153
- She got big tits?
- It's gotta stop somewhere.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.720
Next thing, a black guy
will wanna pork Denise.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.476
They took over sports... baseball,
basketball, football, boxing...

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.756
What do we got left?
Hockey?

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.592
- Golf.
- Golf! Come on, man.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.070
They fuckin' elected Dinkins.
Christ, when does it stop?

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.994
I don't need this shit
from you guys today.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.992
All you ever do
is complain, complain.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.038
When Dinkins won, the next day
everybody was packin' up.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.350
And where'd you go?
Around the corner?

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.876
The first thing he does... appoints
that black police commissioner.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.917
- What's his name?
- Lee Brown.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.877
- Downtown Brown.
- Did you vote?

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.998
- I didn't. I had to fix my car.
- Patty, did you vote?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.958
- No. I had to help my mom.
- Veeshay?

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.634
- Yeah, I voted.
- You didn't vote.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.950
I did vote!
Fuck you.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.952
You're full of shit.
Frankie Botz?

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.156
Sure, I voted...
about six times.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.276
I wrote Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.159
I put a stamp on it.
I don't know if they got it.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.152
Airmail. Fuckin' flew it in.
You're full of shit.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.232
- Sonny, did you vote?
- I went to P.S. 205.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.313
They must've moved. What am I gonna do?
Walk around all day?

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.072
You guys didn't even
register to vote.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.152
You never voted in your life.
No wonder Giuliani lost.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.834
What's the sense of voting?
Look at Marion Barry,

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.150
smokin' crack
with his girlfriend.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.959
I mean, the mayor of D.C.,
the nation's capital!

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.951
What does that have to do
with David Dinkins?

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.752
- Two different people.
- He's black!

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.713
There's Marion Barry
and there's David Dinkins.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:36.360
- Black on black.
- David Dinkins, Marion Barry.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.000
- Black on black.
- He's talkin' of Dinkin Donuts.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.197
One plus one is two...
Two different people.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.396
They're both black!
Read the Post.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.835
- I sell the Post.
- What about Central Park?

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.514
- Yeah, Salaam Baloney.
- Guy writes a rap poem...

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.750
and says he innocent;
He's not remorseful one bit.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.237
What the fuck was that? "I'm a cool type
of fellow, cool, calm, and mellow."

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.154
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm not talking Central Park!

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.720
What are you talkin' about?

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.712
Let me ask you somethin'.
Did you vote?

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.950
Did I vote? Did I vote! Yeah.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.758
- Did you vote?
- I voted.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.195
- Who'd you vote for?
- That's my business.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.199
Your business, huh?
You probably voted for Dinkins.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:20.398
The guy who likes tennis.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.878
For what?
I don't want to talk about it.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.951
I don't want to
go to the doctor.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.674
There may be a fracture.
No, no, no.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.513
No, no, no?
No, no, no.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.592
You're a toughie, huh?

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.318
So, what do you think?
What?

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.996
I mean, it's small and the
rent is an arm and a leg.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.593
That's to be expected.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.480
I always wanted
a village apartment.

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:16.438
You did?
Well, here it is.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.991
The humble residence of two outcasts.
Uh-huh .

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.198
You got that right.
Mmm.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.158
Who's that?
I don't hear shit.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.992
Did you tell anybody
we were here?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.753
Give out your address? I
didn't give out my address.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.673
Go away.
Nobody lives here yet.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.116
Stay right there.
Mmm.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:55.990
A I right! Tell them
we don't want any.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.118
All right.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.511
Yeah? I'm here to see
my younger brother.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.433
I'm his older brother, Gator.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.392
Hey!
Hi.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.075
Angela.
Nice to meet ya.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.600
Come on in.
Thanks.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.479
How ya doin'?
Pretty good.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.197
Flipper?
Yeah?

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.989
It's your brother.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.879
My brother?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.196
Hey!
Hey.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.080
I'm gonna go unpack. All right.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.799
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.918
How'd you find this address?
Cyrus give it to you?

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.914
She's white! No shit!
Yeah, she's white.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:00.959
She got any money...
Real long money?

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.112
No, she doesn't have any money.

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:08.000
She's a temp.
A secretary?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.118
You mean to say my brother
got him an ofay...

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.999
who ain't got no mo-nay? Shh.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.995
What about Drew?
Ming?

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.957
It's complex, man.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.156
You see, me,
myself, personally...

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.834
I would have opted
for some money and shit.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.717
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.950
But I gots to give you some dap.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.237
She looks good!

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.595
Most brothers
with white bitches,

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.389
nine out of ten, they don't never
have 'em no penthouse pet.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.273
Most brothers be havin'
an outhouse pet...

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.510
A dog with flies, fleas...

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.751
But that don't work
for the white boy, see.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:53.072
If a sister's on his arm,
I guarantee you...

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.835
she be slammin'...
Boom! Pow!

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:00.595
All right. What is it
that you want?

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.511
You sure she ain't ot no mone ?
<i>Y</i>

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.194
She could be frontin',
know what I'm sayin'?

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.635
Perpetratin' on the green.

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:11.076
She's Jewish, right?
She's Italian.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.674
Ohhh, shit!

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.000
Wha...

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.995
You always had to do things
the hard way.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.591
Lookee here.
I'm a little light, so...

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.955
how' bout a loan?

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.997
Hmph! Help me.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.552
You didn't get your check
from Soul Train yet?

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.154
Don lost my address.
Uh.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.632
Come on, hit me.
No, no.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.200
Put some cash in my hand.
Don't let the door...

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.955
hit you where God split your back.
Man, gimme some money.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.156
Get out. Don't do
me like this here.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.992
I'm not giving you anything.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.038
Gator, no. Let me go
in and ask the bitch.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.395
No, no.
Don't call her a bitch.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.914
She's not a bitch.
I didn't mean that.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.719
Apologize and get the fuck out.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.278
You okay?

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:28.633
I should go
and see my little girl.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.469
Daddy!
Hey!

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.198
Come here.

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.430
That's a 'girl.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.239
Look what I've got for you.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.629
She's beautiful.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.554
Yes, she is.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.870
Daddy, Mommy takes me the wrong
way to school every day.

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.029
She does?
Yeah.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.078
Ming-a-ling, there's more
than one way to go to school.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.991
I still like our way, Daddy.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.277
I miss you and Mommy making
funny noises in the morning.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.035
That's your mother. She's the loud one.
Wakes up all of Harlem.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.510
It doesn't bother me.
I wish you and Mommy...

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.797
were back together
making those funny noises.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.757
You coming home?

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.912
Uh, go ask your mother. I did.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.354
She told me to ask you.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.990
Your father says to go ask your mother.
I just did.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.072
Yo, Daddy. I'll suck
your dick good for $5.00.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.879
You what? Five dollars.
I'll suck your dick.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.632
Get off me!
$5.00!

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.998
Get away from me! All right, $3.00.
Motherfucker!

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.037
Fuck you!

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.034
Watch where you're goin', man.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.109
You listen to me.
Ahh.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.000
If I ever see you usin' drugs,
I'll kill you. Understand?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.038
<i>L</i> didn't do anything!

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.639
My dear, are you a Catholic?

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.519
Umm... I went to
Catholic school my whole life,

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.989
so I guess I am by now.
Umm.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.116
In this house, we are Baptists.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.273
Yes, the good reverend doctor
was the head of his own flock...

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.794
The Hard Rock Baptist Church.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.795
The devil and his cohorts conspired
to oust me from my congregation.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.633
Now, Daddy, you know...

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.790
the devil ain't had
nothin' to do with it.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.316
It was you. You and your stubbornness.
That's all.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.712
â€œFor it must needs be that
offenses come into the world;

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.193
But woe unto him
by whom the offense cometh."

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.551
I recognize the devil's
handiwork when I see it.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.313
That's good.
Please,

01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.234
let's not argue
at the dinner table.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.995
Flipper, have you
met Angie's folks?

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.880
Not as of yet.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.875
Well, my mother passed away
and my father, he's, uh...

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.997
He's asked me to leave.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.992
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.992
I just don't think we'll
be having dinner there soon.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.949
Has Flipper told you about
his loving wife and daughter?

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.998
Yes, he has.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.959
Um, excuse me.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.599
You think I don't understand
about the white woman...

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.433
committing black adultery,
but I do.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.795
Now, Daddy, no sermons, please.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.270
There was a lot of lynchings
in Willicoochee, Georgia...

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.317
where I come from
when I was a boy.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.598
Willicoochee, Georgia!
What a name!

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.476
Willicoochee.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.996
"Baby, you are the flower...

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.073
"of white southern womanhood,
too holy and pure...

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.277
"to be touched by any man,
including me.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.033
"I'm gonna put you
up on a pedestal...

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.998
"so the whole world will
fall down and worship you.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.631
"And if any nigger
so much as look at you,

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.790
I'll lynch his <i>ass."</i>

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.110
She believed him,
thought she really was...

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.919
holy and pure,
like the Virgin Mary.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.594
She let him put her
up on that pedestal.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.991
Meanwhile, the husband... no
sooner than the sun went down...

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.550
Down to the slave quarters
grabbin' up every piece...

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.757
of black poontang
he could lay his hands on,

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.719
then running to the gin mill
to brag about it.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.599
And that's how our blood
got diluted...

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.069
Mulattoes, quadroons,

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.071
octoroons.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:49.075
I'm sure that most of those
high and mighty white ladies...

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.672
felt abandoned.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.675
But they were so proud to be
white, and therefore superior,

01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:01.959
they kept their mouths shut
and their legs locked tight.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.360
But in the midnight hour,

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.512
layin' there, alone,

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.592
on the hot bed of lust,

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.831
I'm sure they must've thought
what it would be like...

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.834
to have one of them
big, black bucks...

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.993
their husbands were
so desperately afraid of.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.719
I feel sorry for you.
Here it is the nineties,

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:29.395
still tryin' to make up
for what you missed out on.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.994
But I don't blame you.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.479
As for the black man...

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.155
Like my own son, Flipper,
who ought to know better...

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.033
Got a loving wife and daughter...

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:44.989
Still got to fish
in the white man's cesspool,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.389
I have nothing but contempt.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.960
Excuse me.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.873
I don't eat with whoremongers.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.238
<i>But you knew she was comm'.</i>

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.392
That's all right, Mama.
That's all right.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.994
Angie, we're leavin'.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.074
Let's go.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.072
Mama, I'm sorry.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.953
But you invited them.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.000
Great. One good thing
that's happened all night...

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.753
A parking space.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.920
<i>Comm' out'?</i>

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.399
Mmm.
Ohhh!

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.711
Uh! Pow. Hey, hey!
Don't mess with me.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.358
I got two rough brothers.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.512
Who do you think taught Mike Tyson?
Yeah.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.954
Gus D'Amato.
Gus D'Amato?

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.998
But when he died, I taught him
everything he knows. Oh, yeah?

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.072
You wouldn't hit me with
glasses, would you? I would.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.640
All those good
Italian boxers there are.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.393
Graciano, Marciano.

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.994
Come on. LaMotta. LaMotta!

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.349
How's that?
What about Muhammad Ali?

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.715
I hate Ali.
What?

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.917
Ali was a Muslim, and he preached
hate on the white people.

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.276
I'll kill you,
you ever talk about Ali.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.477
You're a witch.
Get off!

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.838
I'll never stand for nobody
to talk about Muhammad Ali.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.070
That's you...
a heretic witch!

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.993
Okay, game over.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.196
Game over.
Gimme my glasses.

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.033
Say please. I'm not
gonna say please.

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.749
That's not gonna stop me
from being angry. Just...

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.195
Get your hands up!
Put 'em up.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.999
Put 'em up.
Get your hands up!

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.991
- Get your hands up.
- Back away.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.879
Get your hands up... now!
Move!

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.518
What'd I do?
Against the wall!

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.911
- You all right, ma'am?
- I'm all right. Let go of me.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.797
Hat's my boyfriend. What are you doing?
Get back.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.555
I'm not her boyfriend. We're just lovers...
just friends.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.359
This must be some kind of mistake.
Angie, shut up.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.431
She doesn't know
what she's talkin' about.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.829
- He wasn't trying to rape you?
- No!

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.673
- I didn't do anything.
- Take the gun from his head.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.038
Talk to me. What? It's just
a big misunderstanding.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.759
That's all.
Slow. Turn around.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.912
I was just makin' sure she got home safe.
All right.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.070
- Sorry about that.
- No harm, no foul.

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.993
We got a call that
an Afro-American male...

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.991
was attacking a Caucasian woman.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.719
You all right, man?
Just a little excitement.

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:54.350
No problem. What?
Give me a reason, man!

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.000
Don't you dare try it!
Better luck next time.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.559
Excuse the intrusion.
Are you crazy?

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.599
I'll have your badge.
I'll bring you up on charges!

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.630
What's the matter with you,
telling 'em we're lovers!

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.792
You tryin' to get me killed?
It's none of their business.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.269
What a waste!

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.915
What the fuck am I doin' here?

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.436
Let's go.
Don't touch me.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.154
Let's go.
Please.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.991
- Morning, Paulie.
- Morning.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.356
- How are you today?
- Good.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.079
See ya later.
Bye.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.074
Excuse me please Your Majesty

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:15.039
enhanced it small but nervously

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.350
Orin?
Yeah.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.000
Can I ask you a question? Yeah.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.152
Did you fill out that application?
Not yet.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.959
Paulie!
I'm gonna get to it.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.237
Listen I... I...

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.077
Do you think you could be
attracted to a white boy?

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.276
A white boy.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.796
Could this white boy
be Paulie Carbone?

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.996
Possibly.
Yeah.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.755
I don't know. Maybe.
I'd have to think about it.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.718
Why don't you think about it?

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.280
Okay. But can I
be honest with you?

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:55.638
I have never thought
of you in that way.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.711
I'm sorry.
I like you.

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.953
You're serious.
Why? Why me?

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:04.190
You really wanna know?

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:07.158
You wanna know?
Yeah, I wanna know.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:12.473
You're intelligent
and I find you very...

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.952
Very attractive.

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.713
Thank you. That's nice.
It's sweet.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.758
But I got to get to work.
I have a class later.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.991
I gotta g0,
Bye.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.234
Remember, think about it
on the way to the subway.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.311
Yeah, right.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:45.749
You see this shit?
I don't believe it.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.990
Don't get too long.
You'll burn your brain out.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.958
I don't know why you're trying
to rap Miss Goody. Goode.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.958
Goode, whatever.
Doesn't even talk to us.

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.430
- Who does she think she is?
- Orin talks...

01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.317
to whoever talks to her.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.470
She said good morning
to me one time.

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.711
Paulie, did you fuck her?

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.838
Did you fuck her?
You know, colored women...

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.989
they like to fuck.
Oh, yeah?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.551
They're built that way. You put a saddle
on them, you ride them into the sunset.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.473
- I'm telling you, they love it.
- How do you know?

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:21.031
- He asked his mother.
- What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.270
My mother's not black.
She's just dark.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:25.556
There are dark Italians.
Come on. Basta.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:28.552
- I'm as white as anybody here.
- Okay, Frankie. Relax.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.712
- We're just busting your balls.
- My brother ain't no crackhead.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.711
- Hey, Frankie!
- Tony's on methadone.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.958
- Fuckin' drug addict. - He's a
recovering addict on methadone. Fuck you!

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.999
- Fuck me? Fuck you!
- Don't talk about my brother that way.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.994
Your brother's a fucking thief. He
stole a radio out of my oar. Come on.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.991
- How do you know?
- How do I know!

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.593
He tried to sell it back to me.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.989
You're full of shit.
Nobody listens to you anyway.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.196
Full of shit? Ask Sonny.
Fuck Sonny.

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.750
- I'm gonna wring your neck.
- I'll wring your neck.

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.550
Hey, hey, hey!

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.914
Go get a job or do something
else somewhere else.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.560
Leave me alone.
Give me room here.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.915
You don't even have
the fucking balls...

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.951
to get a piece of that
big black ass.

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.917
You don't got the pallinis.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.309
- What?
- You don't have the balls.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.790
- Says who?
- Says who? Says all of us!

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.430
- I only hear you.
- I'm in charge here... right?

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.990
- Whatever you say.
- We're friends, all right?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.994
Friends... no such thing.
Either you're doin' it...

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.118
or you're not doin' it,
and you're not doin' it!

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.000
You're jealous because
she speaks to me every morning.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.994
We're dyin' of envy here, Paulie.
Hey!

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.752
Seen Angie lately?

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.593
You miss her, right?

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.833
I heard she's Iivin' in Harlem.
I saw her buyin' a kanga.

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.996
Hear she got a pair of
unlaced Jordans too.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.674
You got a big mouth.
Shut your mouth!

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.954
- I'm not...
- Don't you laugh.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.112
- Eat your fuckin' cake.
- Get outta here.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.919
I'll bury you, you fuck.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.995
Okay, Mama.
It's all right.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.991
I don't know what's wrong
with Gator!

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.233
I've prayed so much for that boy.
He's gonna give me a heart condition.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.995
What did he do now? Gator
left before you got here.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.992
Come over wantin' to
borrow the color TV.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.994
For what? Said he wanted to watch
the Mets, see Gooden pitch.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.469
I told him he couldn't watch
the game here because...

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.475
the reverend would be back and would raise
holy hell if he saw him in this house.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.200
- What happened then?
- He got mad,

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.159
unplugged the TV, picked it up
and walked on out of here.

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.993
Said he'd bring it back
after the game.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.560
Look, Mama. Listen.

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.597
Just listen.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.714
Mama, you can forget about
the TV.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:57.996
You should also forget
about Gator.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.719
In the end, he's only
gonna break your heart.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.313
Hush your foolishness.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.711
The good Lord knows I raised
you two the best I know how.

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.759
Gator is your oldest brother, me
and your father's first child.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.434
Your first child is a crackhead.
Don't say that!

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.353
It's the truth. You mustn't
say that about your brother.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.636
Look, Mama...
He is not a crackhead.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.233
It's not your fault,
not my fault,

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.234
not the good reverend doctor's fault; And
it ain't got nothin' to do with the devil.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.279
Find him and get the TV back
before your father comes home.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.353
Mama, please listen to me.
Forget about the TV.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.034
I don't want to hear any
back talk, not another word!

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.077
Do as I say.
Find your brother...

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.357
and get the good
reverend's I V back. Okay.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.990
All right.
All right.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.000
All right.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.720
Love ya a heap.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.715
In all thine ways, acknowledge the
Lord and He will direct thy path.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.873
Our Father, which art in heaven,

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.240
hallowed be thy name.

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:08.235
Boy is born
<i>in</i> Hard Time, Mississippi

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:13.715
surrounded by four walls
that ain't so pretty

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.198
is parents give him
love and affection

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.990
to keep him strong moving
in the right direction

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.995
livin' just enough just enough

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:31.999

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.674
What's up, man?
What's up?

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:37.274
You seen Gator?
I haven't seen him, man.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.796
He hasn't passed by here? Not
that I know of. If I see him...

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.872
I'll let him know
you're looking for him.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.515
All right.
Peace out.

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.635
And you best believe
she hardly gets a penny.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.354
I know you hear me.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.991
This fuckin' money's short.
I want my fuckin' money!

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.995
Yeah! I'm gonna go over
to Brooklyn and kill you!

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.998
Red is down!
How many you want?

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.957
Red is down!

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.272
Come on, baby, how many you want?
Red is down, red is down.

Livin' Large. My man! What up'?

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.799
This brother's a architect!

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:34.237
I want you to build me
one of those penthouse joints.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.753
Shit is gettin' real good.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.991
It's like gravy. Look, Livin'
Large, I'm lookin' for Gator.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.709
Now I'm the missin' person's bureau.

Fuck it. I know

Yo, what's the name
of that basin' joint?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.435
Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal?
That's the name?

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.716
That's where's he's at,

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.997
- What's the Taj Mahal?
- The Taj Mahal is...

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.391
It's like the Trump Towers
for crackheads around here.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.995
That's where your brother's at.
He's a basin' thief, I'm sorry.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.914
- Where's it at?
- Up on 145th and Convent.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.798
livin' just enough

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:23.433
livin' just enough

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.315
just enough

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.189
just enough

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.431
livin' just enough

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.999
stop givin' just enough

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:47.997
givin' just enough

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.996
I'm sorry.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.559
Gator!

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.952
You crazy or something?
I'll kill you.

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:28.315
I'm sorry.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.395
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Fuck you.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:56.633
I got the shit! Well, light it then!
Come on, Viv.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.278
Gator.
Hey!

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:02.592
Welcome to the Taj Mahal,
eighth wonder of the world.

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:03.999
Mama wants to know
where the TV is.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.995
The Mets lost! They're sorry motherfuckers.
Half can't play as good as Mama.

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.993
Where is the TV, Gator?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.799
Where do you think
the motherfuckin' color TV is?

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.112
It's right here! Me and Viv
smokin' the fuckin' IV.

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:23.399
Sony... no baloney.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.631
Motherfucker, don't...
Hey, hey, hey!

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.996
Come on, Viv. Calm down, baby.
Don't be touchin' me!

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.913
It's all right. Come on! Shit!

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:36.959
That fuckhead's shittin' with my shit!
Look, look here.

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.716
Mama is cryin' her eyes out
over your sorry black ass!

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.757
Look, I like gettin' high.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.196
Why you think I got a room here
at the Taj Mahal?

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.477
I'm a junkie, a crackhead.

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.438
Just tell Mama her older son
is a crackhead.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.398
Fine, that's it.
We're cuttin' you off, Gator.

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.040
Don't come by the good
reverend doctor's house.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.439
Don't ever ask me for shit!

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:04.559
If you want to go out like this,
fine, do it with your crack ho.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.793
Crack ho, crack ho! Eat me,
motherfucker! Fuck you!

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.633
Take your box-head ass on
outta here, motherfucker!

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.395
Get the fuck downtown with
your Mickey Mouse ass...

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.518
and that spaghetti-cookin'
bitch of yours!

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.955
Leave me alone.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.749
All you crackheads!
I'll shoot you.

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.958
Crapshoot for crackheads!

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.995
Give it to me!
Goddamn it, give it to me!

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.880
Pull this motherfuckin'
shit out of your pocket!

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.396
Fuck! Get off me! Where the
fuck you get this from?

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:41.994
I've been suckin' dicks
for your ass,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.116
and you got this shit
in your pocket.

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.872
Gimme all this goddamn shit!

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.316
You and your brother can kiss
my fuckin' yellow ass!

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:53.200
Where's my lighter, man?
Fuck you!

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.318
Fuck all y'all!

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.958
Motherfucker.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.999
Come on, shit, bring
your sorry ass over here.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.994
Here!
Motherfucker.

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:26.273
So, where we goin'?

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:29.238
We gonna be together?

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:33.473
We're together now.

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.869
I don't know.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.316
You don't know.
Who the fuck knows?

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:45.189
Is that the way it is?
That's the way it is.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.430
What about children?

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.716
No, no.
That's not gonna happen.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.553
I'm sayin'...
if we work it out.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.393
No children.

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.994
No, no, no.
No babies.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.470
Besides, I gotta be married
to have children.

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.229
Or have you forgotten
that I already am married?

01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:06.799
With a child.

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.112
No. No half-black,
half-white babies for me.

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:14.476
No!

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.872
Aren't Drew and Vera mulattoes?

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.791
Their skin is lighter than mine.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:25.795
No octoroon, quadroon,
mulatto... babies.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.474
No!

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.997
Don't you have a daughter
who's got white blood?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.399
Yeah, so what?

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.030
At least in my eyes,
Drew and Ming are black.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.435
It's hard enough
just being black out here.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.273
A lot of times the mixed kids...

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.433
they come out all mixed-up,
a bunch of mixed nuts.

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.832
You're not that much
different than my family.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.990
Your family is racist!

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.994
What is this stuff
you're talking now?

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:26.190
Angie?

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.674
Angie!

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.436
I'll be damned.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.637
Ain't that some shit.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.312
Would you like me
to tell you what happened?

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:23.715
I still care about you, Paulie.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.274
How do you feel?

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:32.955
How do you expect me to feel?

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:37.792
I don't feel the same.

01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:39.438
Angie, I gotta go.

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:42.512
Nice to see you back
in the neighborhood.

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.000
Okay.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.400
Out?

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.994
Out where?

01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.317
Out on a date.

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.994
Ahh. A date.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.991
Who with?

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.560
<i>Orin Geode.</i>

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.956
She's...

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:16.993
She's... She's black.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.594
Yeah. Right.
So what?

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:24.549
You don't bring no brown
sugar home to this house!

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.676
If your mother was alive,

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:29.798
she'd turn over in her grave!

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:32.030
Papa, I'm going out.

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.998
You are not going out.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.039
I'm going out. I'll kick your
balls through your throat!

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.999
Pop, I got no life,
you understand?

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.356
Everything I do is for you!

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.590
Paulie, do this.
Paulie, do that.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:51.956
Paulie, wash my back.
Paulie, what's for dinner?

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:55.032
I'm not your fuckin' wife!

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.951
I'm our son!
<i>Y</i>

01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:01.830
You had your life! I want a life, man!
You had yours!

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.719
You...

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.792
You hate me.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:13.995
You hate your own father.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.673
I don't hate you.

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.036
I'd like to kill you,
but I don't hate you.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.118
You are not my son!

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.636
You bastard.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.950
Fuckin'...

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:37.950
You are not my son!
Lou, damn!

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:41.999
You bastard!
You are not my son.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.992
What's the matter?
Where you goin', Paulie?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.595
You burn your supper? Paulie,
who's the lucky girl?

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.671
You look pretty tonight, Paulie.

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.990
You goin' out with
that fuckin' nigger?

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.958
You think you're better
than me, Paulie?

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.998
You're a fuckin' disgrace.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.674
Asshole, you're
no better than me.

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.672
Where's your books, Paulie, huh?

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:08.594
Fuckin' piece of shit, Paulie.

01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:17.959
Aaah! Aaah!

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.000
Hi, Orin. Paulie. Good
God, what happened to you?

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.471
I fell over some garbage.
Come on in.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.992
You look terrible.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.200
Hi.

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:13.235
Angie, I don't think there's
anything left to talk about.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.990
<i>L</i> give UP-

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.038
It's not worth it.
I know.

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.353
I don't love you.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.358
And I doubt seriously
if you've ever loved me.

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.990
Don't tell me what I felt
or didn't feel.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.435
Look, Angie,

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:42.475
this â€œlove will overcome everything"
is in Walt Disney films.

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.150
I've always hated Disney films.

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.476
I didn't come here to
talk about "Snow White."

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:55.474
You got with me
to spite your family...

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.360
'cause you were curious
about black.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:04.117
Is that what you think it was?

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.158
Yeah, I do.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.356
And I was curious about white.

01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.636
Okay, look,
I just came to say...

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.349
I hope everything
works out with your wife.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:25.318
Yeah.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.233
Angie, hold on a second.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.312
You gonna be all right? Yeah.

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.955
Well, I'm moving out
of here in the morning.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:51.952
You can have it if you want.

01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.873
That's okay.

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.956
Okay.

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.952
Okay.

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:30.797
There he is. Going to walk
that goddamn barkin' rat of his.

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.991
Hurry up, old man.
Just keep walkin', keep walkin'.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.958
Here we go.
Showtime!

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:49.000
Gator! What do you want?
I need to see you.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.469
The good reverend doctor isn't here.
I know.

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.677
That's why I need
to see you now.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.039
Well, hurry up!
Come on!

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:02.997
Hey, pretty lady, remember me?

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.630
Say whatever you have to say and
go before your father comes back.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:09.029
What's the matter? Don't you
like my dancing anymore?

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:12.954
You usually offer to cook me something
to eat. I ain't playin' with you.

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:15.474
Say what you got to say
and then go!

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:19.269
If it's money you want, forget it!
The answer is no!

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.035
Mama, I need money!
I'm sick!

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.953
In order for me to get right,
I need money!

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:28.998
You'd feel better
if you had a bath!

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.399
The devil's got you.

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:37.395
75 cents! What the hell am I
gonna do with 75 cents? Gator!

01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.509
Goddamn coupons!

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.990
I save a lot of money using them coupons.
I need some money!

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.037
I know you got money
in here somewhere!

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:48.829
What happened to that $100 I gave
you last time and the time before?

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:52.674
Fuckin' Mon...
Mama, give me some money!

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.832
Don't you raise your voice at me!
I'm still your mother.

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:58.992
As God is my witness,
this is my last time.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.913
I swear 'fore God
and four more white people,

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:05.231
this is the very last time, I swear!
Lies, lies!

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:09.234
You're out of your mind.
I'm not giving you a red cent.

02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:12.710
And what happened to
your father's color TV?

02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:14.996
Mama, I smoked the TV.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.231
Lord have mercy
on your twisted soul.

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:23.235
I ain't goin' nowhere
till you give me some money!

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:26.951
I don't have any money!
What about some jewelry?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.470
These pearls aren't real.
This is costume jewelry.

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.949
Well, gimme something!
Just leave, boy!

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.951
Go before your father
gets back in this house.

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:39.955
I know there's some money here somewhere.
You won't find nothing.

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.997
Just stop!

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.913
Let go of
your mother's pocketbook!

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:47.116
Get away, Mama. I need some money!
I'm sick!

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:51.193
If you're sick, why don't you
go someplace and lie down?

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.669
What is all this shit?
Where is the money?

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.311
Why are you treating me like this? You
won't find money in that pocketbook.

02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:01.995
I haven't got any money,
not the kind you lookin' for.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.277
$20? Is that all
the money you got?

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:08.113
Oh, my God!

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.231
$20 ain't shit!
For the love of Jesus, go!

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:15.790
Boy, didn't I tell you never
to set foot in my house again?

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.995
Where's the money?
Why you hidin' it?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.834
Have you lost your natural mind as
well as your soul? Let him leave.

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.993
Didn't I tell you never to darken
my door again? Gator's leaving.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.995
- I ain't going nowhere.
- All right, all right.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.195
I'll put you out.

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.909
See, Mama? If you gave me the money,
I'd be gone before he came back.

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:38.311
Now give me some money. If I
had money, I'd give it to you.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:42.314
You've got money. Give it to me.
Take anything in this house.

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.994
You can sell it. You got
more money than this $20!

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.470
See this? You can sell it.
I don't want that shit!

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.951
My own flesh and blood, my
firstborn son, and I love you.

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:55.918
But you're evil
and you're better off dead!

02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:00.312
All right, all right!
I'm leavin'.

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.880
I'm leavin'!

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:04.359
Take it. Sell it.

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.593
The devil's work is never done.
The devil's always busy.

02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.878
Mama, check out this new step.

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:15.679
I made this one up just for you.

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.957
I paid a lot for these.
Take 'em!

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.678
Sell it, sell it!

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.717
Take these and sell it, boy.

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:25.838
For God's sake, Gator,
please go.

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.116
I'll pray for you, my son.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:31.829
Father, I stretch
my hands to thee.

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.956
Aaah!

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.200
- Oh, God!
- Help me.

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.830
It hurts! Aaah! My baby.

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.674
No! No!
Make it stop.

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:46.796
Oh, God, no!

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.950
My baby.

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.600
My darling b0)!-

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.473
My firstborn.
No! Not my firstborn!

02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:59.791
Mommy's here.

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.953
Mommy's here!

02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:08.997
Mommy's here!

02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:23.793
No other help I know.

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:27.998
If thou withdraw thyself from me...
Mommy's here!

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.992
Ah, whither shall I go?

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:41.874
Mommy's here.

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:45.232
Mommy's here.

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:48.232
It won't hurt.

02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.993
You better go now.
Just leave.

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.592
Ming.

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.956
Come on, wake up, you faker.

02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:22.711
Daddy, I heard you and Mommy.

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:26.953
Are you moving back in with us?

02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:30.316
No, not today, baby.

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:35.633
Maybe in the future.
When is the future?

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.276
Soon.

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:45.400
Daddy, can you walk me
to school today?

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:28.799
Yo, Daddy, I'll suck your
big black dick for $2.00.

02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:40.469
No!
