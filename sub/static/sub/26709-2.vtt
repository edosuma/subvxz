I've never been
to Austria before.

52:34.433 --> 52:36.000
Alone.

52:36.033 --> 52:38.433
**

52:38.467 --> 52:40.500
You said
you'd be close!

52:40.533 --> 52:44.000
I will be,
but not in the car.

52:44.033 --> 52:46.000
And once you reach
Salzburg Train Station,

52:46.033 --> 52:47.533
I'll find you again.

52:47.567 --> 52:50.433
Hmm.

52:50.467 --> 52:52.233
But there's
one more thing.

52:52.267 --> 52:53.467
Of course.

52:53.500 --> 52:56.667
**

52:56.700 --> 52:58.200
Turn right at the end.

52:58.233 --> 53:04.700
**

53:04.733 --> 53:11.200
**

53:11.233 --> 53:17.600
**

53:17.633 --> 53:20.000
[Seatbelt unbuckles, door opens]

53:20.033 --> 53:26.033
**

53:26.067 --> 53:32.167
**

53:32.200 --> 53:35.000
From here,
you'll be driving that car.

53:35.033 --> 53:37.133
What's the difference?

53:37.167 --> 53:39.033
There's just papers
in there, love.

53:39.067 --> 53:40.733
Nothing sinister.

53:40.767 --> 53:44.367
The point is, you've promised
to do this for Michel here.

53:44.400 --> 53:47.533
Now, if there's any trouble,
you're on your own.

53:47.567 --> 53:48.933
[Keys rattle]

53:48.967 --> 53:51.367
**

53:51.400 --> 53:55.133
It's Russian semtex,
divided into bricks...

53:55.167 --> 53:56.267
Gadi!

53:56.300 --> 53:57.933
...hidden
in the interior panel.

53:57.967 --> 54:01.767
Enough for
a dozen bombs.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.200
Is this real?

54:03.233 --> 54:05.233
It's real.

54:05.267 --> 54:07.000
**

54:07.033 --> 54:08.933
What are you gonna
use it for?

54:08.967 --> 54:13.300
To kill Jews
throughout Europe.

54:13.333 --> 54:16.800
And just as they dispersed
the people of Palestine,

54:16.833 --> 54:18.900
so shall we punish them
in their diaspora

54:18.933 --> 54:20.933
and declare our agony
to the world.

54:20.967 --> 54:23.367
**

54:23.400 --> 54:25.967
I ask you to do this,
Charlie.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.700
**

54:28.733 --> 54:30.767
For me.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.533
For love.

54:33.567 --> 54:37.333
For our great
revolution.

54:37.367 --> 54:40.533
To prove that you are
as special as I believe.

54:40.567 --> 54:43.800
**

54:43.833 --> 54:47.767
This is your debut
in the theater of the real.

54:47.800 --> 54:54.800
**

54:56.233 --> 55:03.233
**

55:03.600 --> 55:10.600
**

55:11.000 --> 55:18.000
**

55:18.400 --> 55:25.400
**
