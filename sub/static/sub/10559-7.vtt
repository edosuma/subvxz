00:47.400 --> 00:49.197
Good morning, Constable.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.719
- George, what have you?
- A skeleton, sir.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.348
Yes, thank you, Constable.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.477
- The circumstances?
- Uh, yes, of course, sir.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.039
The workers were digging this pit here,

01:26.120 --> 01:28.395
they found this poor chap
about 15 feet down.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.595
They should have left the body
where it lay,

01:29.680 --> 01:30.999
but time is money, I suppose.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.269
Indeed.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.111
I'd say he's been
down there some time, sir.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.192
Mmm.
Yes, about 30 years or so, I'd say.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.000
- Thirty years?
- Yes, he was buried under a landfill.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.592
If I'm not mistaken, there were once
docks here for passenger boats.

01:51.880 --> 01:52.949
Mmm.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.399
Interesting.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.079
Perhaps he was expecting trouble.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.155
Indeed.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.758
His pocket flask has held up well.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.671
And, sir, it appears those chains
were wrapped around his entire body.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.595
In that case, George,
however he went into the water,

02:09.680 --> 02:13.309
I'd say it's safe to assume someone
didn't want him coming back up.

02:19.120 --> 02:23.557
A Philadelphia Derringer
manufactured in 1862.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.108
The same type of gun used
to kill Abraham Lincoln.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.712
When was the dock filled in?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.472
1865.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.951
So our man was murdered between
'62 and '65. That's 35 years ago.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.397
Probably just some rummy who got rolled.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.508
This flask is full.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.072
Oh! Bloody gin!

02:47.240 --> 02:48.832
It's filled to the top.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.517
This is a five-ounce flask.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.635
So?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.877
There are only four ounces in it.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.110
- Oh, my.
- Well, how about that?

03:16.960 --> 03:20.191
Jerod Hampson and Lyndon Grove.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.271
"Mr Shanly is to be entrusted
under my authority

03:39.360 --> 03:41.954
"to oversee this cargo. "

03:42.920 --> 03:46.151
Which cargo? And what did this key open?

03:47.280 --> 03:51.478
I have no idea, sir, but
this is signed by a John A MacDonald.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.119
The old Prime Minister?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.952
Our first Prime Minister, sir.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.312
It would appear that this victim of ours
isn't just some rummy.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.830
Sir, I love secret compartments.
They're so mysterious.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.229
I'm thinking about putting
a secret compartment in my book.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.198
I mean the story, not a secret
compartment in the actual...

04:13.960 --> 04:15.871
Sir!
A secret compartment in the actual book!

04:15.960 --> 04:19.315
Think about it, you could hide a...
A smaller book.

04:20.680 --> 04:24.195
George, why don't you see
if Jerod Hampson and Lyndon Grove

04:24.280 --> 04:25.713
are included in the census records?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.279
Yes, sir. Sir, what's this key for?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.118
I don't know yet, George.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.192
Sir, do you think this note was signed
by the John A MacDonald?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.110
Well, I have no reason
to believe it wasn't.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.755
I hear he was something
of a tragic figure, sir.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.274
He had a sickly wife
who was addicted to opium,

04:41.360 --> 04:42.588
his younger brother was murdered

04:42.680 --> 04:44.477
and, of course, he himself, sir,
was a bit of a...

04:45.800 --> 04:46.949
Run along now, George,

04:47.040 --> 04:50.350
and see if you can find any newspaper
reports on Shanly's disappearance

04:50.440 --> 04:52.749
and if he had
any dealings with MacDonald.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.068
Yes, sir. Right, away.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.912
Any initial impressions,
Doctor?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.754
Actually, I have discovered
something of interest.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.715
The lateral section of the fourth rib
had a deep scratch,

05:08.120 --> 05:09.951
suggesting an encounter with a knife.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.993
Could that be the cause of death?

05:12.440 --> 05:15.910
I can only say that at some point
in this man's life, he was stabbed.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.231
The knife entered the ribs
just below the right armpit

05:19.320 --> 05:21.754
by what appears to have been
a slight upper thrust.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.754
But, yes, it likely killed him.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.633
I find that an odd location,
beneath the arm.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.075
Shake my hand.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.354
Interesting.
Yes, that could be how it happened.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.997
Yes. Which would imply
that the killer was left-handed.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.918
Oh, very good, Julia.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.794
Was there anything else?

05:51.440 --> 05:53.192
This is a pile of bones, William.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.157
Consider yourself lucky
we found what we did.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.674
Yes, of course.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.953
Sir, I'm afraid there's no record
of a Jerod Hampson

06:05.040 --> 06:07.474
or a Lyndon Grove pre-dating 1861.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.358
However, I do think
we've found Mr Shanly.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.269
He disappeared October 22, 1864.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.556
The Minister of Defence?

06:16.840 --> 06:17.955
Top toff, then, was he?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.632
Which begs the question,

06:20.720 --> 06:22.312
how does a Minister
in the Canadian government

06:22.400 --> 06:24.152
end up being chucked
into Toronto harbour?

06:24.360 --> 06:28.035
Actually, sir, begging the question
is a term for a logical fallacy

06:28.120 --> 06:30.839
in which the proposition to be proved
is assumed in the premise.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.317
It's not a question
that begs to be asked?

06:33.400 --> 06:34.515
No.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.794
Then why the hell do they call it that?

06:35.880 --> 06:36.949
I don't know.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.309
Mmm. So how do you intend to proceed?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.640
Well, sir, I believe I'll start
with Mr Shanly's widow.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.474
Mortimer just dropped off
the face of the earth.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.153
I'd assumed he'd met
some unkind fate, of course.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.197
Do you have any idea what he might have
been doing down at the docks?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.599
None.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.432
As far as I knew, he was in Quebec City,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.272
where parliament was in session.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.279
Did he have any enemies?

07:02.520 --> 07:03.714
He was in politics.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.950
Ones that may have wished him harm?

07:07.800 --> 07:08.949
Mortimer was obsessed

07:09.240 --> 07:12.789
with the idea that the Union Army
would attack Canada

07:12.880 --> 07:14.154
when the South was defeated.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.958
Ah, yes. A common fear at the time.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.871
One of the reasons
for Canadian Confederation.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.598
Morty was convinced that
the Union government was spying on him.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.833
They may very well have been.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.639
He was the Minister of Militia
and Defence, after all.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.753
Do you think
that's who killed him, then?

07:31.480 --> 07:32.595
The Americans?

07:33.360 --> 07:36.557
It's much too early to say
for certain, Mrs Shanly.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.673
Well, please keep me informed.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.675
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:43.400 --> 07:46.039
I've got to make plans
to bury my husband.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.158
Detective Murdoch, I presume?

07:59.920 --> 08:01.876
<i>- Yes?
- Carson Turner, Toronto Gazette.</i>

08:01.960 --> 08:03.439
Any developments on the Shanly case?

08:03.960 --> 08:06.428
Not as yet.
And now is certainly not the time.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.078
Was anything recovered from the body?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.272
A letter from John A MacDonald, perhaps?

08:11.480 --> 08:14.074
I'm not at liberty to discuss
matters of evidence.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.112
Do you deny finding such a letter?

08:16.880 --> 08:20.668
I won't confirm or deny anything
until I've concluded my investigation,

08:20.760 --> 08:22.273
Mr Turner, was it?

08:22.360 --> 08:23.395
Thank you for your time.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.749
Good day.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.953
George.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.873
Rather a small turn-out.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.597
Have you spoken with everyone?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.068
Yes, sir. Mostly friends
and professional acquaintances.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.628
- I have all their names and addresses.
- Very good.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.678
Sir, an old friend of ours
is here today.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.239
An old friend?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.313
Terrence Meyers.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.915
We are gathered here today to mark
the passing of Mortimer Shanly...

08:55.000 --> 08:59.278
So, sir, clockwise from this chap
nearest us we have Colonel Grodin...

08:59.600 --> 09:02.398
- Army man?
- Yes, sir. American Civil War.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.711
- Oh? Which side?
- The South, told me twice.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.359
He's living in St Catharines now.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.873
What's his relationship
to the deceased?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.831
Uh, friends, apparently.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.071
Next to him we have Lawrence Cheevers,
now that's Shanly's old secretary,

09:14.160 --> 09:16.230
now working for
the government of Ontario.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.514
Over here standing next
to the widow and her family,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.272
Bertrand Jacobson, another friend.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.754
Now lives in Toronto.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.592
He leadeth me towards water.
He restores my soul.

09:28.680 --> 09:32.275
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness for his name's sake.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.316
- Amen.
- Amen.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.833
He is at peace.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.391
- Detective.
- Mr Meyers.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.792
Is there any point in asking you
what your connection is to this case?

09:56.880 --> 09:58.074
Hmm. Well, let's see.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.878
Shanly was Minister
of Militia and Defence.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.996
I work for the Ministry
of Militia and Defence.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.279
Mmm. And are you here
to scuttle my investigation once again?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.920
Oh, it's too late for that.
Cat's already out of the bag.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.198
The public demands an investigation.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.508
But it's going to be on my terms.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.670
There are issues
of national security involved here.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.148
Aren't there always.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.594
I want you to keep me apprised
of any developments whatsoever.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.355
Call me at this number and I'll be
at the station within the hour.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.555
Oh...

10:25.480 --> 10:29.917
If you're approached by this man,
say nothing and inform me immediately.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.877
I was already approached by him.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.235
<i>His name is Turner,
he's a reporter for the Gazette.</i>

10:34.600 --> 10:38.718
Reporter...
His real name is Allen Clegg.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.473
He's an attaché with
the American Consulate, ergo a spy.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.629
What did he want?

10:43.320 --> 10:45.629
He wanted to know if a letter
from Sir John A MacDonald

10:45.720 --> 10:47.836
had been found with Mr Shanly's remains.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.116
Uh-huh. What did you tell him?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.669
Nothing.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.599
This letter must never be
mentioned to anyone. Especially Clegg.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.318
What's the significance of the letter?

11:01.640 --> 11:02.709
Well, there is no letter.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.318
You didn't find one, did you?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.519
What did you find, Murdoch?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.634
- A pistol and a flask.
- Uh-huh.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.274
Anything else?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.238
The contents of the flask.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.636
Well, that's not surprising.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.792
Shanly had a fondness for the bottle.
Not by MacDonald's standards, but...

11:25.760 --> 11:26.875
Anyway...

11:27.760 --> 11:30.558
Remember, Detective, any developments.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.669
Meyers, eh?

11:32.760 --> 11:35.274
This Shanly business must have rattled
a few closets in Ottawa.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.033
All over this little note.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.237
Well, I didn't give it to him, sir.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.039
He likely would have confiscated
the only evidence we had.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.229
Careful, Murdoch.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.799
Meyers has threatened us
with treason before

11:44.880 --> 11:46.029
for keeping secrets from him.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.918
Sirs, according to Shanly's schedule,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.595
he cancelled all appointments
on October 21 and 22, 1864.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.073
- He disappeared on the 22nd.
- Well, something must have been up.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.076
Also, he seems to have had
quite a few meetings

11:59.160 --> 12:00.593
with the Secretariat of the Treasury

12:00.680 --> 12:02.318
in the weeks leading
up to his disappearance,

12:02.400 --> 12:03.469
a Frederick Norton.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.518
Is he still alive and kicking?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.750
No, sir, I checked.
He died 10 years back.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.796
But Shanly's secretary might know
something of these meetings.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.552
He's still alive.
He was at the funeral today.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.149
A Mr Cheevers.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.993
I don't know
why Mr Shanly was in Toronto.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.399
No one told me anything.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.914
According to his appointment book,
Mr Shanly had no less than six meetings

12:22.000 --> 12:25.675
with the Secretariat of the Treasury
in the weeks leading up to his death.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.988
What was discussed in those meetings?

12:27.800 --> 12:30.155
I'm afraid I wasn't privy
to those meetings, either.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.349
But you were aware of them?

12:34.360 --> 12:38.273
Well, they later became the subject
of some controversy.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.959
Why is that?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.268
A rumour circulated
that gold bullion had been removed

12:44.360 --> 12:46.749
from the Treasury
the day Mr Shanly disappeared.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.200
- Oh? How much?
- A million dollars' worth.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.869
There was a flurry of activity
in both ministries.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.428
Police confiscating files
and such.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.993
And then, suddenly, everything was fine.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.318
An accounting error, apparently.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.792
Uh, sorry to interrupt, sir,
but there's been a development.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.514
- Sir.
- George.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.550
Do you think it's coincidence
that Mr Shanly's good friend

13:23.640 --> 13:26.074
Bertrand Jacobson is now lying here
shot to death?

13:26.640 --> 13:27.755
I wouldn't say, sir.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.434
No.
It would appear our case from the past

13:30.520 --> 13:33.034
has taken a detour into the present.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.468
Sir, Mrs Jacobson said
she surprised the killer

13:43.560 --> 13:45.551
going through her husband's
desk drawers.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.154
She's confident she would recognise him
if she saw him again.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.309
Very good.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.436
Sir, the weapon lies here,
as we found it.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.239
Hmm.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.790
- A cap and ball revolver.
- Yes, sir.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.269
I haven't seen one of those
since my training day.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.595
"Training Day"?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.315
It's been fired recently.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.075
This was standard issue
for the Confederate Army.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.951
Colonel Grodin was
a Confederate soldier.

14:14.560 --> 14:19.076
Sir, what I find a great coincidence
is that two men killed 35 years apart

14:20.080 --> 14:22.275
both have a wound
to this unusual part of the body.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.108
Yes. How does one get shot
in the underarm?

14:26.760 --> 14:29.752
One thing I thought of, sir,
was that perhaps it's a defensive wound.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.957
Perhaps he raised his arm thusly,
exposing his underarm.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.519
Meaning he knew the shot was coming.

14:36.440 --> 14:40.956
Hmm. George, perhaps the contents
of Mr Jacobson's desk drawers

14:41.040 --> 14:42.837
will tell us
what the killer was searching for.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.353
I'll pack them up straight away, sir.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.834
<i>It's such a shock.</i>

14:47.560 --> 14:49.835
Bertie and I had been together
for 34 years.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.475
Since I was 18.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.878
You met him in 1864?

14:55.480 --> 14:56.913
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mrs Jacobson,

14:57.360 --> 15:00.033
did you know him
on October 22 of that year?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.719
Why, no.
That was the day before I met him.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.313
- How is it the two of you met?
- Oh, it was...

15:09.280 --> 15:10.872
Like a miracle, really.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.995
He washed up at my family's cottage
on Toronto Island.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.749
- That's unusual, to say the least.
- He'd fallen off a fishing boat.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.880
He was near dead and frozen
by the time we found him.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.153
I nursed him back to health.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.709
He was a good man.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.513
Brave, too.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.791
He almost died in that lake yet
he went back out fishing every Sunday.

15:33.320 --> 15:37.074
Mrs Jacobson, what do you know
about your husband's life

15:37.160 --> 15:38.639
prior to him meeting you?

15:39.760 --> 15:40.909
I know he was an American,

15:41.760 --> 15:43.318
born and raised in Virginia.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.356
Did he fight in the American Civil War?

15:45.840 --> 15:47.717
- Yes, he did.
- For which side?

15:47.800 --> 15:48.835
Both.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.153
He was drafted into the Union Army,
but he switched sides.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.557
- And do you know why?
- No, I don't.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.116
He didn't like to talk about his past,
especially the war.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.955
Yes.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.035
According to your statement
to my constable,

16:04.120 --> 16:06.873
you got a good look
at the killer before he fled.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.279
Can you describe him?

16:08.600 --> 16:11.592
Dark hair, high forehead,

16:11.720 --> 16:13.631
um, not very tall.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.593
Is this the man you saw?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.069
That's him!

16:25.080 --> 16:26.593
That's definitely him.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.674
Sir, Allen Clegg is on his way.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.069
And look what I've just found
in Jacobson's files.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.039
Elvira May.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.518
Who's Elvira May?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.318
Not who, sir, but what.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.789
Have a look.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.273
<i>Elvira May was a steamboat?</i>

16:49.840 --> 16:53.196
A steamboat that sank
on October 22, 1864,

16:53.440 --> 16:56.238
one day before Jacobson
washed ashore on Toronto Island.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.949
Bertrand Jacobson claims
to have fallen off of a fishing boat.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.589
<i>He washed up on shore the day after
the Elvira May went missing.</i>

17:05.040 --> 17:08.635
Jacobson knew Mortimer Shanly.
Shanly was killed on the docks.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.438
<i>How does Shanly connect
to the Elvira May?</i>

17:12.640 --> 17:14.631
<i>Where was the Elvira May going?</i>

17:14.720 --> 17:17.518
According to the papers, it was
commissioned to go to St Catharines.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.432
George, we know someone
from St Catharines.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.589
Colonel Grodin.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.796
Yes, I knew Jacobson.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.678
We both fought the war
for Southern independence.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.639
You mean the Civil War?

17:31.720 --> 17:35.998
There was nothing civil about what
those Yankee bastards did to my home.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.399
How did you come to know Jacobson?

17:38.640 --> 17:42.269
We broke out of a Union prison
in Ohio and headed north.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.391
We found a home for ourselves here.

17:44.920 --> 17:49.357
Jacobson carried on to Toronto
and I settled in St Catharines.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.990
Yes, St Catharines.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.799
<i>That was the destination
of the Elvira May, yes?</i>

17:56.760 --> 17:58.079
You're familiar with that name?

17:58.720 --> 17:59.914
Of course I am.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.276
Jacobson was on the boat.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.351
Oh, I think
it's more than that, Colonel.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.628
I believe that boat
was on some kind of mission

18:08.320 --> 18:10.470
involving a special cargo.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.790
And I think Mr Shanly was also involved.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.034
He was.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.511
In fact, until a day or two ago,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.717
I believed he had gone down
with that boat, too.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.160
Shanly and Jacobson
were on their way to see you?

18:24.840 --> 18:25.909
Yes.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.313
- Why?
- We...

18:29.440 --> 18:30.839
We had business.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.189
What kind of business?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.990
I'm afraid I made a promise
never to breathe a word of that.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.796
A promise to Shanly?
He died 34 years ago.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.672
It's a question of honour.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.756
A Southern gentleman keeps his promises.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.193
Sir?

18:48.280 --> 18:50.157
- Yes, George?
- Allen Clegg is here.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.356
<i>Mr Turner, how are things
at the Toronto Gazette?</i>

18:54.920 --> 18:57.229
I apologise for
deceiving you, Detective.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.595
Where were you yesterday
at about half past two?

19:00.080 --> 19:01.479
I was at Bert Jacobson's house.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.233
You admit it?

19:03.320 --> 19:06.039
The truth is Jacobson was dead
by the time I arrived.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.713
But instead of reporting to the police
that a man had been murdered,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.438
you rifled through his desk drawers?

19:12.440 --> 19:14.556
I would have preferred to talk
to him personally, but...

19:15.640 --> 19:17.949
- What were you looking for?
- Information.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.071
On a boat that sank 34 years ago.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.919
<i>The Elvira May.</i>

19:23.640 --> 19:25.596
Do you know what cargo it was carrying?

19:26.200 --> 19:28.475
I have my suspicions, but by all means.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.240
<i>The Elvira May was hired
by Mortimer Shanly</i>

19:32.320 --> 19:34.993
to transport four strongboxes
of gold bullion

19:35.080 --> 19:37.640
from the government reserves in Kingston

19:37.720 --> 19:40.154
to a Confederate agent in St Catharines.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.830
- To what end?
- You have to ask?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.712
Your government supported
the Confederate States.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.790
Sir, Canada was neutral
during the Civil War.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.871
Nobody's neutral, Detective.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.595
Everyone has an agenda.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.759
Canada's was the break-up
of the American Union.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.314
You were under specific instructions
not to talk to that man.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.198
That man is the lead suspect
in a murder investigation.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.634
He has diplomatic immunity.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.518
We still need to know what happened.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.752
This investigation
is now over, gentlemen.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.990
I don't think so,
Mr Meyers.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.949
I beg your pardon.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.998
We live in a democracy, pal.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.116
You want to shut down
this investigation,

20:26.200 --> 20:27.315
show us your letter of authority.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.598
And while you're at it, tell us
about Shanly, the missing gold

20:30.680 --> 20:32.477
and the letter from John A MacDonald.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.551
There is no letter.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.315
I found it.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.069
And I want to know what it means.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.669
Where is it?

20:44.320 --> 20:46.197
Where you can't get
your grubby little hands on it.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.235
4179.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.832
It's Meyers here, put him on.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.753
Yes, sir. It's as we feared, I'm afraid.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.400
Uh, no, sir,
I think you'd better come to us.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.155
Thank you, sir.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.799
That was my boss.
And he's coming to speak to you.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.313
I tell you, lads,
this year the Stanley Cup goes

21:23.400 --> 21:24.515
to the Ottawa Capitals.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.194
They've just acquired this brilliant
chap from the Rat Portage Thistles.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.759
He used to play cover point.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.548
I'm here to speak
with Detective Murdoch.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.879
- Bloody hell!
- Ah, gentlemen,

21:41.960 --> 21:44.633
allow me to introduce
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.110
- Prime Minister.
- Sir.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.675
Gentlemen, we need to talk.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.790
Yes, this is Sir John's handwriting.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.234
Then this note must be destroyed.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.992
But it has evidentiary value.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.396
Murdoch, if the Americans were
to get their hands on this,

22:11.480 --> 22:13.357
it would mean the end of Canada.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.000
Apologies, Prime Minister,
but what the hell is going on?

22:16.080 --> 22:18.036
- Inspector, we...
- Gentlemen.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.752
Have either of you
heard of the Copperheads?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.553
A loose assortment
of Confederate-leaning renegades

22:30.640 --> 22:34.315
who sought to end
the American Civil War, I believe.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.234
Yes, they also sought to create
a second breakaway republic

22:38.320 --> 22:40.390
in the American north-west.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.752
Now you can see the benefits
to Canada in such a scenario.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.154
An American republic divided
into three parts would be vastly weaker.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.879
So it's true, then?

22:49.960 --> 22:53.032
The Canadian government
conspired to fund the Confederacy?

22:53.120 --> 22:57.033
Elements of the government conspired,
namely Shanly and Frederick Norton.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.272
The Secretariat of the Treasury?

22:59.360 --> 23:02.511
Shanly arranged to steal gold
bullion from Government reserves

23:03.040 --> 23:05.076
and transport it to a Confederate agent.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.869
But surely even the Minister of Defence
can't simply walk into the Treasury

23:08.960 --> 23:11.474
and check out a million dollars
in gold bullion.

23:11.920 --> 23:15.276
No, it would have to be transferred
according to a strict protocol.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.670
Overriding protocol required
a special letter of authority

23:18.760 --> 23:20.512
from the highest office in the land.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.875
Why would John A MacDonald
write such a letter?

23:22.960 --> 23:23.995
Shanly lied to him.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.954
He told him a Canadian soldier
was killed

23:27.040 --> 23:30.555
taking part in a Confederate raid
into Vermont from Canadian soil.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.955
- Oh, the St Albans Raid, sir.
- Oh.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.235
The Americans were
already furious about that.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.118
MacDonald knew
if a Canadian soldier was involved,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.269
it would have meant war.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.757
Shanly claimed the soldier's body
was smuggled back across the border,

23:44.320 --> 23:46.834
but that Union spies
had gotten wind of it.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.629
So he requested a letter of authority
to escort the casket home,

23:50.720 --> 23:52.790
to ensure the spies
didn't intercept the body.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.958
- But there was no dead soldier.
- No.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.993
It was all a ruse to obtain
the letter of authority.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.470
Which Shanly then used to transport gold
bullion to the Confederates instead.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.949
So who killed Shanly?

24:03.320 --> 24:04.719
We have no idea.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.156
Whatever became of the gold,
the Americans must never find it.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.156
It's proof
of a Canadian-Confederate conspiracy.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.877
The war that would provoke
would destroy the Dominion.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.033
But, sir, it was 34 years ago.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.914
McKinley's administration
has already attacked Spain

24:21.000 --> 24:22.513
on the slimmest pretext.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.198
Now, on the verge of victory,
they'll be itching for more.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.398
We can't give them an excuse.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.478
Well, if it's of any help,
Prime Minister,

24:33.200 --> 24:34.599
I believe I know where the gold is.

24:37.920 --> 24:41.037
I believe this map
is what Allen Clegg was searching for

24:41.120 --> 24:42.951
at Bertrand Jacobson's house.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.629
Clegg told me that Shanly
loaded the gold

24:45.720 --> 24:48.188
into strongboxes and shipped them aboard

24:48.280 --> 24:52.034
<i>a steamer called the Elvira May,
headed for St Catharines.</i>

24:52.880 --> 24:55.474
So the Confederate agent
was to receive the gold there?

24:55.880 --> 24:57.950
<i>Yes, sir. But the Elvira May sank.</i>

24:58.560 --> 25:02.758
Jacobson's wife told me that
he went out fishing every Sunday,

25:02.840 --> 25:05.593
<i>probably dragging his nets
for the Elvira May.</i>

25:05.680 --> 25:08.513
I believe this shaded area here
represents the section

25:08.600 --> 25:10.670
where Jacobson thought the boat sank.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.077
Those are American waters,
less than, what,

25:13.160 --> 25:14.752
ten miles from their shores?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.874
<i>Why would the Elvira May
end up in American waters</i>

25:17.960 --> 25:19.598
if she was destined for St Catharines?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.671
Maybe Jacobson had the location wrong.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.035
It's possible.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.155
I don't know what we're worried about.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.357
No-one is going to find a sunken boat
in a circle five miles wide.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.236
Well, sir, at that shallow depth,
a convoy of fishing boats

25:31.320 --> 25:33.675
dragging their nets
would eventually snag on it.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.916
So if the Americans are bent
on finding this, they will.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.158
That means we have to find it first.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.598
Sir, surely we can't send a convoy
of our boats into their waters.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.315
There may be another way.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.754
It would involve some untried science,
but I think it could work.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.150
Murdoch, I am loathe to say this,
but I'm listening.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.471
I'll need some special equipment
and some time, Prime Minister.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.393
- Not too much time, Detective.
- Sir.

26:25.480 --> 26:30.031
Everything we see is the result
of light waves being reflected off

26:30.120 --> 26:32.554
of the surface of any given object.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.712
Unfortunately, light waves
don't travel very far under water,

26:35.800 --> 26:38.951
but sound waves do
and the same principle applies.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.712
We call it an echo.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.914
So it stands to reason

26:44.000 --> 26:48.755
that, if we were to send strong pulses
of sound from our source here,

26:48.840 --> 26:53.960
any that hit a hard, vertical surface
will be reflected back

26:54.040 --> 26:56.952
and detected by our microphone here.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.955
Up to what distance?

26:59.480 --> 27:01.789
- By my calculations, up to one mile.
- Hmm.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.519
And since sound travels
at a fixed rate of speed,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.231
by continuously measuring the amount
of time it takes for the waves

27:08.320 --> 27:10.390
to be reflected back to the microphone,

27:10.480 --> 27:13.233
we can determine the distance
to the sunken vessel.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.591
To that end I've built...

27:18.560 --> 27:19.595
A graphiser.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.789
Hmm.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.110
As the sound pulses are collected
by the microphone,

27:32.200 --> 27:34.350
they are then converted
to electrical pulses

27:34.440 --> 27:36.635
which move the needle
and mark the paper.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.589
Let me try that. Hah!

27:40.880 --> 27:43.314
You can see my voice!

27:43.400 --> 27:44.913
Very good, sir.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.875
So when is this to happen?

27:47.240 --> 27:50.710
Constable Crabtree has secured
a fishing vessel. We sail tonight.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.633
I can't see a bloody thing.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.558
Sir, how can you tell where we are?

28:10.800 --> 28:14.475
At a fixed bearing and speed,
location is a function of time.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.356
Okay. So where are we?

28:18.120 --> 28:19.872
We're entering our range.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.919
Right then, George.
Put the microphone in the water.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.035
Aye, aye, sir.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.595
"Aye, aye"?

28:25.880 --> 28:27.757
Just trying to get into
the nautical spirit of things, sir.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.915
The needle's moving already.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.115
It's capturing the sound
of the motors, sir.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.035
What the hell was that?

28:41.480 --> 28:42.879
That's our source sound.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.996
I've rigged it below decks
to sound automatically.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.235
Ah.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.956
Suppose the Americans proved
that we tried to fund

28:56.040 --> 28:58.031
the Confederates and these Copperheads.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.751
Do you really think they'd
up and march across the border?

29:01.720 --> 29:03.517
Probably not how it would happen.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.513
A bully doesn't pick a fight
with a punch.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.794
He provokes it with an insult.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.797
Most fistfights start
with a shoving match.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.633
Exactly. And then they would
demand an apology.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.517
If we gave them one,
we'd be admitting guilt.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.950
The yellow press would
demand punitive action.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.829
Any further denial would be
viewed as fresh provocation,

29:18.920 --> 29:19.989
and so it would go.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.354
Until they're marching
across the border.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.273
Make no mistake,
they'd hand us our heads.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.951
I think we've got something. Murdoch!

29:33.840 --> 29:35.034
Cut the engines!

29:40.240 --> 29:41.309
Fifty yards and closing.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.554
George, time to for you
to put on your diving suit.

29:44.640 --> 29:45.709
Sir.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.878
<i>How do we know it's the Elvira May
that's down there?</i>

29:48.920 --> 29:49.989
We don't, sir.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.795
- Ready, Crabtree?
- Sir.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.912
- Good luck.
- Ow!

30:07.000 --> 30:08.513
Thank you, sir.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.715
I'll fasten the helmet.

30:10.800 --> 30:14.110
- Now, George, you remember the signals?
- Yes, sir.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.031
- When you find the boat?
- One bell.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.156
Good. And when you
locate the strongboxes?

30:18.240 --> 30:20.390
- Two.
- Very good.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.473
Now remember, it's only 100 feet
but the pressure will be tremendous.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.150
Don't hold your breath
on the way back up.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.470
- Yes, sir.
- Right, then. Skipper.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.117
All right. Take it down.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.275
He's found the boat.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.518
Bloody hell,
he's found the strongboxes, too.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.669
Bring him up, skipper.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.228
- Are you all right, George?
- I'm all right.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.599
I found it!

31:49.920 --> 31:52.070
At least we found the gold
before the Yanks.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.793
Sir, we're picking up a sound.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.598
Something's coming right at us.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.436
<i>You are in American waters.
Prepare to be towed to port.</i>

32:09.320 --> 32:10.389
Bloody hell!

32:13.920 --> 32:15.592
- Meyers.
- Clegg.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.831
We meet again, as they say.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.712
Open the strongbox.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.791
We don't have the key.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.033
Drill the lock, we'll blow it.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.070
Stand back. Shield your eyes.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.790
Bricks. Nothing but damn bricks!

33:04.280 --> 33:06.669
I wasn't sure that the Yanks
weren't going to lock us up anyway.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.115
We're not made of gold, Inspector,
it's that simple.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.470
But that look on Clegg's face.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.673
What I don't understand though, is,

33:16.760 --> 33:19.672
how did 240 pounds of bullion
turn into bricks?

33:20.200 --> 33:22.191
Maybe there never was any bullion.

33:22.280 --> 33:25.078
No? One thing we know for certain
is one million dollars' worth

33:25.160 --> 33:26.593
was removed from the Treasury.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.839
<i>If it helps, sirs, I think I know how
the Elvira May went down.</i>

33:29.920 --> 33:31.114
How?

33:31.200 --> 33:32.474
Well, there was
a great hole in the hull, sir.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.835
That's how I was able to locate
the strongboxes so easily.

33:34.920 --> 33:35.989
You think she hit something?

33:36.560 --> 33:38.437
I don't think so, sir.
The hole was splintered outward

33:38.720 --> 33:40.199
and one of the boxes
seemed to be blown apart.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.632
So there must have been
a bomb in that box.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.239
But who set it?
And what happened to the bloody gold?

33:50.480 --> 33:52.471
According to records, four strongboxes,

33:52.560 --> 33:56.235
each containing 60 pounds of gold, were
removed from the Treasury in Kingston,

33:56.320 --> 33:58.515
then taken to the train
in an armoured wagon.

33:58.960 --> 33:59.995
What then?

34:01.120 --> 34:02.838
<i>The strongboxes were placed
in a safe,</i>

34:02.920 --> 34:05.559
<i>to which only the rail guard
knew the combination.</i>

34:06.760 --> 34:09.638
<i>The key to the strongboxes
was then entrusted to Mortimer Shanly</i>

34:09.719 --> 34:12.553
<i>after he showed the letter of authority
to the Treasury officials.</i>

34:14.239 --> 34:17.550
Then the strongboxes were accompanied
by Shanly and the rail guard

34:17.639 --> 34:19.551
until the train reached Union Station.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.476
Could Shanly have stolen
the gold after that?

34:23.400 --> 34:24.514
Unlikely.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.478
<i>Why would Shanly put the strongboxes
on board the Elvira May</i>

34:27.560 --> 34:29.516
if he had already removed the gold?

34:30.840 --> 34:33.991
Sirs, the rail guard from Grand Trunk
who oversaw the shipment is here.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.869
Ah.

34:36.679 --> 34:39.069
Were you guarding the baggage car
the whole time?

34:39.159 --> 34:42.357
Most of the time. Mr Shanly told
me to get dinner at one point.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.512
Then about Port Hope,
I came down with a case of potty trots.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.715
But there was always someone there.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.349
We all took our turns.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.514
All?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.319
Me, Shanly and the other guy.

34:53.719 --> 34:54.789
What other guy?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.559
I don't remember his name.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.911
Do you remember
anything specific about him?

34:59.680 --> 35:02.831
He was nice.
Shared some of his candy treats with me.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.239
We talked a bit.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.790
As I recall, he had a bit of a stutter.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.318
Mr Shanly intended to claim
ministerial prerogative

35:11.400 --> 35:14.836
but this was always
of questionable legality.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.718
- So you didn't steal the gold?
- How could I?

35:17.840 --> 35:21.071
It was locked up in that safe.
I didn't have the combination.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.074
But the safe was opened
while you were in the baggage car.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.993
You could have noted
the combination, Mr Cheevers.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.038
There was a guard at all times.
Mr Shanly was there.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.516
They didn't leave to have dinner?

35:33.080 --> 35:36.675
And I believe you fed the guard
laxatives in the form of candy.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.999
No, Mr Cheevers,
I believe there was a period of time

35:41.080 --> 35:42.911
when you were alone in that baggage car.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.912
And a time when Shanly
was alone in there.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.432
He stole the gold.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.156
No, sir, it was you.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.353
<i>When Shanly and the guard were gone,
you opened the safe</i>

35:55.280 --> 35:57.874
<i>and removed the strongboxes
filled with the gold.</i>

35:58.560 --> 36:02.838
<i>You then replaced those strongboxes
with identical ones filled with bricks.</i>

36:03.360 --> 36:06.272
You then took the original strongboxes
filled with the gold

36:06.360 --> 36:09.113
and put them back in the shipping crate.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.559
Bravo, detective.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.436
You make it sound so easy,
I almost wish I'd done it.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.795
Do you really think I'd have spent
the last 34 years

36:17.880 --> 36:19.154
in a boring government job

36:19.240 --> 36:21.834
if I had a million dollars of gold
at my disposal?

36:27.960 --> 36:31.316
Sir, we struck gold, so to speak.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.277
We found these in Cheevers' basement.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.758
I see you've been to my house.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.878
You sawed through the boxes
once you got them home.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.199
What choice did I have?

36:48.680 --> 36:52.355
That's right. Mr Shanly had the key
to these strongboxes.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.510
You have the key to these boxes?

36:57.720 --> 36:59.756
Why not put your theory to the test.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.311
These bars are made of lead.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.114
Disappointing, isn't it.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.949
Try sawing through them
for two weeks and see how you feel

37:33.960 --> 37:37.475
and then try doing it again,
just in case the first was an anomaly.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.873
I obviously didn't steal any gold.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.229
So what's the charge?

37:46.120 --> 37:47.189
Murder.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.310
Murder? I...

37:51.160 --> 37:52.957
I didn't kill Shanly.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.951
I was nowhere near
the docks that night.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.515
Perhaps, but in order
for your plan to work,

37:57.600 --> 37:59.955
you needed Shanly
to disappear, permanently.

38:00.720 --> 38:03.757
That's why you loaded a strongbox
with a time bomb,

38:03.840 --> 38:06.434
<i>believing Shanly would sail
on the Elvira May.</i>

38:06.640 --> 38:07.755
You have no evidence.

38:08.440 --> 38:11.398
We found the one of the strongboxes
blown apart on the lake floor.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.231
<i>People died when the Elvira May
went down, Mr Cheevers.</i>

38:18.040 --> 38:21.635
First bricks, now lead.
Where's the bloody gold?

38:21.720 --> 38:23.039
Could a rail guard have taken it?

38:23.680 --> 38:25.272
No, I believe it was Mr Shanly.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.959
But you said it wasn't him.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.476
Yes, I know, sir.
At first, I thought it didn't make sense

38:30.560 --> 38:34.030
that Shanly would knowingly ship
the strongboxes filled with bricks,

38:34.120 --> 38:37.237
but it makes perfect sense if he thought
his mission was compromised.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.634
You think he knew that Cheevers
was going to make a play for the gold?

38:41.160 --> 38:43.151
- Not Cheevers.
- A spy.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.235
Right? He thought an American spy
was onto the plan.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.313
And what better way to flush out a spy

38:48.400 --> 38:50.550
than to go ahead
with the plan as intended,

38:50.640 --> 38:52.835
but substitute the lead bars for gold.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.158
Stash the gold somewhere safe.
Get it to the Confederates another day.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.232
Where the hell did he stash it?
And how did he do it?

39:00.720 --> 39:01.994
The same way that Cheevers did.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.878
<i>Mr Shanly observed the combination
to the safe, as did Cheevers.</i>

39:06.960 --> 39:08.871
<i>Later that night,
when the others were at dinner,</i>

39:08.960 --> 39:11.872
<i>Shanly removed the strongboxes
containing the gold,</i>

39:11.960 --> 39:14.679
<i>but instead of using a shipping crate,
as Cheevers did,</i>

39:14.760 --> 39:16.830
<i>he used the coffin
of the fictitious soldier.</i>

39:20.640 --> 39:22.312
So Shanly thought he was compromised,

39:22.400 --> 39:24.152
so he brought along lead bars
in the coffin.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.593
Cheevers wants to steal the gold,

39:25.680 --> 39:29.229
so he brings along four strongboxes
of bricks in a shipping crate?

39:29.560 --> 39:30.629
Yes.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.953
Cheevers thinks
the gold is in the crate,

39:34.040 --> 39:36.349
but Shanly has it in the coffin.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.637
So, gentlemen,
where the hell is the coffin?

39:39.880 --> 39:42.314
Mr Meyers, I believe I know where it is.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.752
Jerod Hampson
and Lyndon Grove.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.514
Lyndon is a small town
just west of Hamilton.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.669
The rail line runs through it.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.235
What's Grove then?

39:59.800 --> 40:01.358
Sirs, would anybody else like to...

40:01.640 --> 40:02.834
Come on, hurry up there, son.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.112
Is this
what you're looking for, Mr Meyers?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.272
A million dollars in gold.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.720
Actually it's only worth
about 370,000 now, Murdoch.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.473
The market value of gold has diminished
somewhat since the Civil War.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.950
Hmm, and what's the Government going
to do with all of this found money.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.435
Oh, that's top secret.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.592
- Really.
- Not really, no.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.398
I have no idea. It's not my job.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.948
What exactly is your job, Mr Meyers?

40:54.480 --> 40:55.913
Well, that is top secret.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.318
Well, you found the gold, Murdoch,

41:02.400 --> 41:04.914
but you still have to solve
the murders of Shanly and Jacobson.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.718
Yes, I've been giving
that some thought, sir.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.869
No doubt.

41:08.160 --> 41:12.278
Well, sir, I've been considering
Prime Minister Laurier's question,

41:12.360 --> 41:14.476
"What was a boat
that was headed to St Catharines

41:14.560 --> 41:15.834
"doing in American waters?"

41:16.480 --> 41:18.789
Unless it was headed to America.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.390
<i>There was a Union spy
on the Elvira May.</i>

41:23.040 --> 41:25.508
He killed Shanly, left him at the docks,

41:25.600 --> 41:27.511
took control of the boat
and headed to America.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.149
Exactly, George, and I believe that
Union spy was Bertrand Jacobson.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.435
Why him?

41:32.520 --> 41:34.238
He knew of the plans to ship the gold.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.596
His wife told me that he fought
in the Union Army but switched sides.

41:37.840 --> 41:38.875
I don't think he switched sides.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.394
I believe he became a spy
for the Union Army.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.391
And Shanly's killer was left-handed.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.517
Jacobson was also left-handed.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.629
George, take some of the men
over to the Jacobson property.

41:49.720 --> 41:50.835
I believe you'll find the ball...

41:50.920 --> 41:53.912
The ball from a Griswold
and Gunnison revolver. Sir, right away.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.868
So who killed Jacobson?

41:56.440 --> 41:57.839
Colonel Grodin.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.717
You were the Confederate agent

41:59.800 --> 42:02.712
awaiting that shipment of gold
in St Catharines, weren't you?

42:04.720 --> 42:09.396
I know what you are thinking.
I did not murder Jacobson.

42:12.040 --> 42:15.237
I've noticed that you choose
your words very carefully, Colonel.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.920
Murder, that's cowardly.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.035
A Southern gentleman
does not commit murder

42:23.240 --> 42:26.516
but he can kill with honour, can't he?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.758
This is a ball

42:33.320 --> 42:36.392
that my constables
found on Jacobson's property.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.913
We've tested it
and it matches Jacobson's pistol.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.833
Is that so?

42:42.920 --> 42:45.388
It was found roughly
where you were standing

42:45.480 --> 42:47.516
when you shot Bertrand Jacobson.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.156
You challenged him
to a duel, didn't you?

42:52.120 --> 42:53.599
I did nothing of the kind.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.398
No. That's your answer?

42:57.960 --> 43:01.270
Would you stake your honour
as a gentleman on that?

43:06.360 --> 43:10.638
We agreed to fire at the count of three.
He fired first.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.755
And missed?

43:12.400 --> 43:16.234
No, I dodged at the count of two.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.039
I knew he would cheat.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.236
He was a Union man, after all.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.392
How did you know he was a Union man?

43:24.320 --> 43:28.472
<i>Jacobson told me that Shanly
went down on the Elvira May.</i>

43:29.120 --> 43:30.758
Now why would he lie about that

43:30.840 --> 43:33.229
unless he was the son of a bitch
who killed him?

43:34.360 --> 43:39.354
And why would Jacobson kill Shanly
unless he was a goddamn Union spy?

43:39.920 --> 43:42.229
That's why I killed Jacobson.

43:45.160 --> 43:49.995
Well, the country is safe from invasion
and you've solved two murders in one go.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.548
You'll sleep well tonight,
me old mucker.

43:52.360 --> 43:53.679
Yes, sir, I believe I will.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.998
One thing that puzzles me.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.832
How did you know
that Jacobson was a lefty?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.230
Well, I surmised
that only a left-handed shooter

44:01.320 --> 44:04.630
would have exposed his left underarm
to Grodin's line of fire.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.994
Hmm.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.959
In other words, you assumed
your conclusion in your premise.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.593
You just begged the question, Murdoch.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.875
Yes, sir, I did.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.595
Oh...

44:27.880 --> 44:29.757
- Prime Minister.
- Detective Murdoch.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.712
- Inspector.
- Sir.

44:31.960 --> 44:36.033
I wanted to thank you personally.
Your country owes you a great debt.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.399
Thank you, sir.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.515
Gentlemen.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.957
You realise, of course, the country can

44:45.040 --> 44:46.951
never really know
of the debt it owes you?

44:47.240 --> 44:49.117
I'm aware of that, Mr Meyers.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.316
Ah, well, till we meet again.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.198
Oddly this time, Mr Meyers,
I look forward to it.

44:54.560 --> 44:55.595
Huh.
