WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.660
I gotta tell you, Rick.
It's pretty great...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.787
to be in this spaceship,
just the two of us, you know?

00:05.881 --> 00:07.497
Just cruising around,
Rick and Morty style.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.002
I agree, Morty.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.503
It's nice to get
back to the basics

00:10.594 --> 00:12.335
after a pretty intense,
mixed-bag of a year.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.464
- Ohh!
- Relax.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.137
That's what windshields
are for.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.090
I didn't know that
there were bugs out in space.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.515
Well, w-what did you think,
Morty?

00:18.602 --> 00:20.263
Life just developed
on Earth by itself?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.937
Here, let me
take care of this.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.061
Geez, Rick, that's disgusting.
I don't wanna look at that.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.357
Yeah, guess
I'm out of fluid.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.310
L-Let me find
a place to stop.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.366
Hey, muchacho, does your planet
have wiper fluid yet,

00:36.453 --> 00:38.660
or are you gonna freak out
and start worshipping us?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.279
The general store
ought to have what you need.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.785
Thanks.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.116
Of course, you'll be wanting
to be gone from here by sundown.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.043
Yeah, sure thing.
Wait a minute. What? Why?

00:46.129 --> 00:48.120
Sundown is when
the festival begins.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.250
The festival?

00:49.341 --> 00:51.457
Ooh, well, for millennia,

00:51.552 --> 00:54.385
our society has been free
of crime and war,

00:54.471 --> 00:56.462
- Living in perfect peace.
- Oh, I know what this is!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.298
You've been able
to sustain world peace

00:58.392 --> 01:00.429
because you have one night
a year where you all run around

01:00.519 --> 01:02.931
robbing and murdering each other
without consequence.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.260
- That's right.
- What?!

01:04.355 --> 01:06.142
It's like "The Purge," Morty.
That movie "The Purge"?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.974
Oh, have you
been here before?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.979
No, no, but I've been to a few
planets with the same gimmick.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.562
You know, sometimes it's called
the Cleansing or the Red Time.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.114
There was this one world that
called it just Murder Night.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.690
I-It's a purge planet.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.693
They're peaceful, and then,
you know, they just purge.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.620
- T-That's horrible!
- Yeah.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.323
You want to check it out?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.408
♪♪

01:55.198 --> 01:56.984
So, what do you do
during the festival?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.237
You lock yourself in,
or you go out and do some stuff?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.365
Oh, I do
some pretty bad stuff.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.867
Oh, I bet you do, old timer.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.664
Gee-- Rick, come on.
The sun is setting.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.207
W-We got to
get out of here.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.285
All right, well, w-what do
I owe you for the wiper fluid?

02:09.378 --> 02:11.711
It's on the house.
Oh, and, uh,

02:11.798 --> 02:14.210
why -- why don't you have
some candy bars, as well?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.883
Oh, no way.
That's really nice of you.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.711
I'm a nice guy...
for now.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.421
Ohh, I don't doubt it.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.005
- Rick!
- Yeah, yeah.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.807
Hey, have a good festival,
old timer.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.426
I intend to.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.646
Rick, unlock it!

02:29.733 --> 02:30.814
Just a second, Morty.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.604
Oh, look at that sunset.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.230
Stop screwing around.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.648
There we go. Much better.
Now we can see.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.698
Great.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.492
Hey, you know what, Morty?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.694
Why don't we christen our
squeaky-clean windshield here

02:43.789 --> 02:45.450
by watching a little
of this purge through it?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.372
What?! No!
What is your problem?!

02:47.459 --> 02:49.200
Morty, grow up.
If you don't want to watch,

02:49.294 --> 02:50.784
don't watch,
but, you know, it's my car.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.790
Also, if you
tell your mom about this,

02:52.881 --> 02:54.542
- I'll purge you.
- You're the worst.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.670
This planet is the worst.
How can you be into this?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.501
You know, people are gonna
kill each other.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.506
So, what, y-y-you trying
to sit here and tell me that

03:00.597 --> 03:02.634
i-if -- if there's
a video online

03:02.724 --> 03:03.805
with someone getting
decapitated,

03:03.892 --> 03:05.428
- You don't click on it?
- No!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.601
Why -- Why would I do that?
You do that?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.224
I don't,
because it would bore me.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.770
I see shit like that
for breakfast, Morty.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.518
But if you don't do it,
I say it's because

03:12.609 --> 03:14.270
you're afraid of your own
primal instincts.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.943
So you stuff them down and --

03:16.029 --> 03:17.485
Oh, oh!
Shh. Shh. It's starting.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.937
- Oh-Ho-Ho! Here we go.
- I'm not watching.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
your medal's in the mail.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.525
- I'm gonna get a closer look.
- Oh, okay, sure.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.950
And then someone's
gonna throw a rock

03:24.037 --> 03:25.698
and hit the car
and then we're gonna crash

03:25.789 --> 03:27.279
and we're gonna
be stuck down there

03:27.374 --> 03:28.614
and it's gonna be
what we deserve.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.575
Yawn.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.330
Whoa!

03:32.421 --> 03:34.833
Whoa, they are purging
the fuck out of each other.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.506
Oh, my God!

03:37.592 --> 03:39.629
Oh shit!

03:39.720 --> 03:42.712
That was --
Okay, yeah. T-That was gross.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.968
Wow. Man, I think my eyes
were bigger than my stomach

03:45.058 --> 03:46.844
on this one, Morty.
Ugh.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.560
My appetite for purge-spectating
got filled pretty quick.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.353
Oh, God.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.646
Get away from me!

03:56.737 --> 03:58.227
No! No! Help!

03:58.321 --> 03:59.436
Somebody help me! Aah!

03:59.531 --> 04:01.272
All right, Morty.
L-Let's get out of here.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.448
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
W-We have to go down there.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.821
What? Why?

04:04.911 --> 04:06.993
That poor girl.
W-We have to save her.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.991
Uh, Morty, in space,
we have something we call

04:09.082 --> 04:11.449
the non-interference policy.
We got the wiper fluid.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.534
We watched them kill each other.
We're leaving.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.370
Help me save that girl, or I'm
telling Mom you brought me here.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.752
You little turd.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.628
Please! Leave me alone!

04:20.719 --> 04:22.676
Leave you alone?
During a purge?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.345
I don't think so, baby.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.266
It's okay.
We're not gonna hurt you.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.559
My name is Morty.
This is my grandpa.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.013
- We're tourists.
- Not anymore.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.472
- Aah!
- Aah!

04:35.567 --> 04:37.023
Oh, my god.
This is fucking awesome!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.851
Morty, this is really cool.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.687
Hey, y-you want to help me out
here and kill some people?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.398
It's fun.
We're totally justified...

04:43.492 --> 04:45.324
because we're saving
a little girl.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.822
I mean, w-w-we're both free and
clear to murder these people.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.620
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.162
I have to find
somewhere to hide.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.705
Well, you can hide with us.
Rick?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.534
- Yeah?
- Do you think we could take --

04:54.628 --> 04:55.914
- W-What's your name?
- Arthrisha.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.790
Could we take Arthrisha
up in the ship

04:57.881 --> 04:59.622
and, you know,
just wait out the purge?

04:59.716 --> 05:00.877
Oh, Morty, how can I refuse

05:00.967 --> 05:03.254
after all you've done
to blackmail me?

05:07.599 --> 05:09.966
Your vehicle --
Is it from the gods?

05:10.227 --> 05:11.592
- No.
- Yes.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.850
So, uh, you know,
when the purge started,

05:15.941 --> 05:17.727
did people get into it
right away,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.934
or were they like,
"Wait, what?

05:20.028 --> 05:22.395
This is gonna stop crime
how, exactly?"

05:22.489 --> 05:25.402
Yeah, it took some time
for people to accept it.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.903
Yeah, I bet.
I bet.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.779
Yeah, it's kind of like
cellphones, you know?

05:28.870 --> 05:30.201
At first,
everyone was like,

05:30.288 --> 05:31.528
"Look at those
douchebags purging."

05:31.623 --> 05:32.863
And then
the next thing you know,

05:32.958 --> 05:34.619
they're like,
"It's just so convenient."

05:34.709 --> 05:36.199
Geez, you working on
your tight five

05:36.294 --> 05:37.784
for the comedy store,
Morty?

05:41.758 --> 05:42.919
Whatcha doing?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.421
Watching some TV,
playing on your phone?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.379
- Is that a real question?
- Just making conversation.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.965
Are you? What part of that
gives me anything to work with?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.847
My choice is to say nothing,
be sarcastic,

05:53.937 --> 05:55.894
or bark "yes"
like a trained animal.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.471
It's not a conversation.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.022
You're holding me
verbally hostage.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.392
Okay, ass-face.
I'll go in the kitchen.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.692
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.395
Whatcha doing?
Going into the kitchen?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.650
Okay.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.356
- Yeah, you like that?
- Screw you.

06:07.450 --> 06:11.569
So, uh, do most people
wear masks when they purge?

06:11.663 --> 06:13.825
I-I don't want to answer
any more purge questions.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.701
All right,
hey, hey, that's cool.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.499
I can roll with that.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.548
- My nana!
- Huh?

06:25.635 --> 06:27.672
My nana!
We have to save her!

06:29.681 --> 06:31.843
You just now remembered
your nana exists.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.844
I-I was traumatized.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.926
Haven't you been through
like 15 purges?

06:36.021 --> 06:37.136
I mean, some as a child?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.971
Will somebody
just help me get her?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.931
Fine, whatever.
Morty, stay.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.031
Oh, God. Oh, crap. Oh, crap!

06:53.121 --> 06:54.907
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:54.998 --> 06:57.160
Get the fuck out
of the flying machine!

06:57.250 --> 06:58.866
Oh, my God!
O-Okay! Okay!

06:58.960 --> 07:00.450
Back up, asshole.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.956
- Back up.
- Ohh.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.459
- Back the fuck up!
- Aah!

07:04.549 --> 07:07.462
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry,

07:07.552 --> 07:09.509
but that's not really
worth anything tonight, is it?

07:09.596 --> 07:12.463
Y-You can't leave us here.
You're killing us!

07:12.557 --> 07:14.924
You hear me? Come back.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.556
Y-You got to come back.
Change your mind.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.058
Oh, geez.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.015
Morty! Aah!
Fucking Amish bitch shot me!

07:23.109 --> 07:24.816
She tried to purge me, Morty.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.985
You let your wiener do
the walking, and now I'm dead.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.484
- Rick, she took the car!
- You fucking kidding me, Morty?!

07:29.574 --> 07:30.860
She took my car
and the gun.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.658
We're like the rest
of these assholes now.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.075
W-W-We're gonna
get purged, Morty.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.535
Help me up.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.953
Oh, geez, geez!
Wait a minute, Rick.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.656
Why don't we just use
your portal gun?

07:38.750 --> 07:39.911
It's in the car, dip-ass.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.491
Oh, God, it hurts.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.076
She got me right in
the goddamn liver, Morty.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.079
It's the hardest-working liver
in the galaxy, Morty,

07:45.340 --> 07:47.081
and now it has a hole in it.
I hope it was worth it.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.798
I was just trying
to do right.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.092
Yeah, well, that's not really
the theme of tonight's party.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.757
Heads up. Rapists.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.087
Well, don't just stand there,
Morty.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.305
- Purge 'em.
- Me?

07:55.392 --> 07:57.224
No, me. Should I rub
my liver hole on them?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.142
Pick up a stick or something
and kill them.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.932
Um, w-we come in peace.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.389
Oh, my God.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.938
There's more
where that came from!

08:07.028 --> 08:08.314
You want to get purged,
you bring it!

08:08.405 --> 08:11.272
Drop drop your shit!
Drop it all.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.027
Morty, go get their shit.
Hurry up.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.700
I only had one
of those things I threw.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.447
I'm holding a box of Tic Tacs
right now.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.868
- Want some crackers?
- No, thank you.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.541
Are you ready
to be nice to me?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.413
In exchange
for crackers?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.166
- What happened to you?
- Dad, get a job.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.836
You're trying to create drama
because you're bored.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.963
Oh.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.465
It's the space phone
Grandpa gave us.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.388
- Hello?
- Hey, Summer, it's Grandpa.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.260
I need you
to do me a favor.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.761
- I can barely hear you.
- Who is it?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.469
<i>Morty and I are on a planet
that's purging.</i>

08:41.563 --> 08:43.850
- <i>I need you to take down --</i>
- A plan that's what?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.897
We're on a planet
that's purging, Summer. Purging.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.521
We lost our car and my gun,
and we're in a purge.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.147
- Ooh, is it Taddi Mason?
- Like the movie "The Purge"?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.979
<i>Yes, I-I need you
to take --</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:54.360
- That movie sucked.
- Oh, my God. Hold on.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.112
<i>It's not Taddi Mason?</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:57.863
<i>Dad, who the fuck
is Taddi Mason?</i>

08:57.954 --> 08:59.035
- <i>My friend.</i>
- Aah!

08:59.122 --> 09:00.578
Are you okay?
I'm putting you on speaker.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.281
- Taddi?
- Yes, Jerry, it's Taddi,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.082
a person no one's ever heard of
until now,

09:04.169 --> 09:05.751
calling you
on a space phone.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.419
<i>I can't tell
if you're being sarcastic.</i>

09:09.466 --> 09:10.956
Aah!

09:12.594 --> 09:14.551
Reload, fast.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.469
Summer, w-we need you
to take down this number.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.888
- Quit screwing around.
- Morty? Are you all right?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.057
- <i>No!</i>
- Why are you with Taddi Mason?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.431
<i>Holy shit Dad!
Shut the fuck up!</i>

09:23.521 --> 09:26.980
Okay. I guess I'm just this
entire family's toilet paper.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.058
Are you writing this down?
Will you please write this down?

09:29.152 --> 09:32.235
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>
- 7-7-1-9-8...

09:32.489 --> 09:36.232
...3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.109
Aah!

09:41.623 --> 09:43.785
You son of a bitch!

09:43.875 --> 09:45.457
Morty, I don't want to be
the "a little help" guy,

09:45.543 --> 09:48.160
but a little help?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.086
- Aah!
- <i>Okay, I have a pen. Go.</i>

09:50.173 --> 09:53.837
7-7-1-9-8-3-
6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.133
A spoon, Morty?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.335
- A spoon?!
- I'm sorry.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.090
There's a pile of silverware
next to you,

09:58.181 --> 10:00.343
and you throw me the one thing
that can never kill anything?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.015
All right, okay!

10:02.102 --> 10:04.093
Summer, on the shelf above
my workbench in the garage,

10:04.187 --> 10:05.894
<i>there's a red box
with a keypad on it.</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:07.721
<i>You're gonna
take that box outside,</i>

10:07.816 --> 10:10.103
<i>and you're gonna type the number
I just gave you into the keypad.</i>

10:10.193 --> 10:11.649
- <i>Got it?</i>
- Got it.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.477
Is it just part of growing up
to hate your dad?

10:13.571 --> 10:16.484
I'm ignoring you.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.406
Morty, if I can get to the top
of that lighthouse,

10:18.493 --> 10:20.530
I can send the beacon, and your
sister can launch our package.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.281
Just remember,
if there's people in there

10:22.539 --> 10:24.121
and they try to purge us,
we got to purge them first.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.164
We're not purging anyone, Rick,
all right? W-Will you stop it?

10:26.251 --> 10:27.958
Morty, if we're gonna
survive tonight,

10:28.044 --> 10:30.502
you're gonna need to harness
your repressed rage.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.544
I don't have any!

10:31.631 --> 10:34.464
Spoken like a person
with repressed rage.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.086
I take no part
in the festival.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.592
If you desire to kill me,
I only ask you do it quickly.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.048
No such agenda, chief.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.725
We're not too keen on the purge,
either, sir.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.927
We were just hoping to get
on the roof of your lighthouse

10:47.021 --> 10:48.853
so we can send a beacon
to my sister on Earth.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.647
- It's a different planet.
- By the way,

10:50.733 --> 10:53.475
life on other planets exists.
Don't let it distract you.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.902
I'll let you use my lighthouse
for shelter and beacon-sending

10:55.989 --> 10:57.571
on the condition that you listen
to my tale.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.523
- Okay.
- Deal.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.403
All right, I'm gonna go
to the roof and set things up.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.485
- Morty, you listen to his tale.
- Okay.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.624
"Fade in. Exterior.
Unnamed city. Day.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.706
The hustle and bustle
is a symphony of progress.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.417
We pan past windows, each of
which contain a different story,

11:18.511 --> 11:21.549
to find Jacey Lakims, 28 --
hot, but doesn't know it.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.004
Jacey stops
when her high heel gets caught

11:23.099 --> 11:24.715
in the grating of a sewer.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.301
Suddenly, a man steps into frame
and points a gun at her.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.473
This is not her day.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.975
Fade to black.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.978
Title -- 'Three weeks earlier.”

11:36.362 --> 11:39.104
You really don't want
to talk to me about this.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.566
Dad, Grandpa and Morty
are in danger.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.195
You're unemployed,
and you're bored.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.994
- They're a higher priority.
- Stop saying I'm unemployed!

11:46.080 --> 11:49.323
Okay, 7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1

11:49.584 --> 11:52.246
- 2 -- Aah!
- Good Lord! Now what?

11:54.214 --> 11:57.457
Look, I'm your father, and
I love you is all I'm saying.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.757
- I'll leave it at that.
- Fine, Dad!

12:01.346 --> 12:04.088
Oh, he might have said
to take it outside.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.468
Come on, Summer.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.765
How hard is it
to type some numbers into a box?

12:07.852 --> 12:09.217
<i>Target locked.</i>

12:09.312 --> 12:10.768
Oh, thank God.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.313
Well, I did my job.
Summer did her job.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.892
Now all Morty has to do is
finish listening to that tale.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.353
Maybe I don't need
a new friend.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.901
Maybe you're
the only friend I need.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.073
Need, or want?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.151
I've never been much
for wanting.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.783
Spoken like someone
with needs.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.034
- Oh, geez.
- Hmm?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.035
Uh, sorry.
K-Keep going.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.958
"Jacey reaches out
and touches his face.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.376
It's clear he needs
what she wants.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.166
She's a woman.
He's a man.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.840
The city burns in the background
as he takes her in his arms.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.087
Fade out.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.009
Title -- 'The End'...

12:43.096 --> 12:44.052
question mark."

12:44.138 --> 12:45.424
- Wow.
- Yeah?

12:45.682 --> 12:48.265
It's...
G-Good job. Good job.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.841
- You liked it?
- Of course I did.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.722
You didn't laugh
at the scene in the bar.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.771
I... thought it was funny,
but I wanted to hear the rest.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.598
Do you have any thoughts?
Notes?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.730
No. I-I just enjoyed it.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.982
That's my note, you know?
Please write more.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.188
- Seems a little insincere.
- What? No.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.865
You don't have
to mollycoddle me.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.942
I want to improve my writing.
Tell me your real thoughts.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.949
All right. Well, um,
I'm not a huge fan, personally,

13:10.039 --> 13:11.905
of the whole "three weeks
earlier" teaser thing.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.456
I feel like, you know,

13:13.710 --> 13:14.871
we should start our stories
where they begin

13:14.961 --> 13:16.417
not start them
where they get interest--

13:16.671 --> 13:18.082
- Get out.
- Um, what?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.879
No, I'm sick of this.
You bang on my door,

13:19.966 --> 13:21.877
you beg me to help you, I share
something personal with you,

13:21.968 --> 13:23.299
and you take
a giant shit on it.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.047
Hey, man, we asked
if we could put up a beacon --

13:25.138 --> 13:26.549
Well, you can't.
I want you out of here.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.050
You're a petty person,
and you're insecure,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.973
and you're taking it out on me.
That's a good script.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.220
What the hell?!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.426
I don't care.
I want you out.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.018
- What?
- Take that thing down.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.971
Your grandson
is a shitty person. Leave now.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.476
- Morty!
- Rick, I didn't do anything.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.224
I sat through
his entire screenplay --

13:39.319 --> 13:40.480
You "sat through it"?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.444
Yes! Did you want me
to weep with joy?

13:42.697 --> 13:45.234
- It's terrible!
- Whoa Morty! We're guests here.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.033
I tried to be a good guest!
He dragged it out of me!

13:48.119 --> 13:50.326
- I'm taking down this beacon.
- No, stop! That's not fair!

13:50.413 --> 13:52.120
Just because
you hate your own writing

13:52.206 --> 13:53.696
doesn't make me
a bad person!

13:53.791 --> 13:54.781
Aah!

13:56.336 --> 13:59.169
You like that? You want me
to cut to three weeks earlier

13:59.255 --> 14:00.290
when you were alive?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.169
Whoa, Morty.
You just purged.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.045
<i>Beacon arriving.</i>

14:05.136 --> 14:06.877
Okay, time to go.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.962
Well, terrific.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.924
Dad, what's going on?
What's the deal here?

14:12.018 --> 14:14.180
I just wanted to spend some time
with my daughter.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.931
You're growing up so fast.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.933
- You used to be my little girl.
- Yeah.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.435
Remember when we used to
go to the playground,

14:19.525 --> 14:21.061
and I'd push you
on the swings?

14:21.152 --> 14:23.484
Oh, you could push me higher
than all the other kids.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.354
You were so small
and cute.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.439
I thought you were gonna fly
right off into the street.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.444
I used to pee my pants.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.742
I know,
and now look at you!

14:31.829 --> 14:33.911
You have a job.
You're making really good money.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.204
You're not paying any rent,

14:35.291 --> 14:37.202
so you have plenty
of disposable income.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.624
Oh, God, Dad.
Please, don't.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.372
I just need
a few hundred dollars

14:40.463 --> 14:42.374
to get through the month. I have
some interviews coming up.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.126
Something's gonna come through.
I can feel it.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.378
I'm going inside.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.635
I guess this is what
rock bottom feels like, Jerry.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.212
Ow!

14:51.307 --> 14:53.218
It's okay, Morty.
It's the purge, you know?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.892
Pushing old lighthouse keepers
down the stairs is totally cool.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.390
It's not cool, Rick.
I-I'm not like these people.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.347
I can't run around chopping
people's heads off

15:00.441 --> 15:02.773
one day a year and then
sleep well the rest of the time.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.022
Well, you better start getting
used to it, little bitch,

15:05.113 --> 15:07.400
because we got
some fucking company.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.106
Hey, there he is.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.565
Here I am.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.368
Morty.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.294

Never expected that

15:44.652 --> 15:46.859
All right, uh,
let's go find my ship.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.572
Hey, hey, Morty, Morty. There
it is down there -- My ship.

15:54.829 --> 15:55.864
It looks to me like the...

Okay, Morty, now you're just
shooting corpses.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.303
- How do you like this?
- Okay, buddy.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.005
All right. That's good.
Good job.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.886
Time to go home.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.226
Wait, stop!
Please, don't kill me!

16:24.317 --> 16:26.479
I-I never intended to harm you,
I swear.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.731
I am trying to end the festival.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.313
- W-W-What do you mean?
- I was going to use your ship

16:31.407 --> 16:34.365
to destroy the rich assholes
that run our society

16:34.452 --> 16:37.490
and save my people from the
horrors of this yearly festival.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.197
Fuck that, Rick! We gotta
kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

16:40.291 --> 16:42.453
Whoa! Geez, Morty,
purge it down a little.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.079
"Purge! Don't purge!"

16:44.170 --> 16:45.660
You're sending me
mixed messages, Rick.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.208
Morty...
you're acting like

16:47.298 --> 16:48.504

you old, rickety piece of crap!

17:00.937 --> 17:02.678
Now, where are
these rich people?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.270
To another successful year
of the festival,

17:11.364 --> 17:15.073
pitting poor people against each
other for thousands of years.

is one of your poor people,

17:26.337 --> 17:27.792

felt like it was okay

17:27.880 --> 17:29.541
to subject her
to inhuman conditions

17:29.632 --> 17:31.794
because there was no chance
of it ever hurting you.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.670
It's sort of
the socio-political equivalent

17:33.928 --> 17:36.090
of, say, a suit of power armor
around you.

I mean, thank you so much

Okay, okay,
you can stop saying it.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.523

Oh, you're so sweet, I just --
Oh, but I can't.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.909
Yeah, you're still
doing it.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.614
It won't be easy creating a new
society from the ground up.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.042
Well, a helpful rule might be if
you need something, you get it.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.789
- Pretty simple, right?
- I need food.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.630
- Who's got food for that guy?
- I do, but this is for me.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.956
Can't you make some more?

19:37.051 --> 19:39.509
Oh, sure. And while
I'm making food for everyone,

19:39.595 --> 19:41.506
who takes care of my kids?

19:41.597 --> 19:45.511
I'll take care of your kids,
if I get some extra food for it.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.012
Extra food?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.845
Well, I'm not gonna do extra
work if we all get the same.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.517
All right,
okay, fair is fair.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.393
If you do extra work,
you get extra food.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.270
Oh.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.601
Who's gonna keep track

19:56.696 --> 19:59.028
of who gets how much food
for how much work?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.651
Hello. I can do that.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.482
I'll keep track
of everyone's food,

20:02.576 --> 20:04.237
you know,
in exchange for food.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.739
That's not a real job!

20:05.830 --> 20:07.821
Oh, and making food is?

20:07.915 --> 20:10.247
You son of a bitch!

20:10.334 --> 20:11.540
Eat this!

whoa, whoa.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.415
Cool it, now.
Take it easy.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.716
There's too much
aggression here.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.840
What if we designate
a period of time

20:22.930 --> 20:26.093
during which we can all
get this hate, murder,

20:26.183 --> 20:29.016
and rage out of our system --

20:29.103 --> 20:30.559
I can't help
but feel ashamed

20:30.646 --> 20:32.228
about what I did
back there, Rick.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.476
I guess you were right. I've got
a lot of repressed stuff

20:34.567 --> 20:36.558
- I need to deal with.
- Don't worry about it, Morty.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.359
Remember
those candy bars earlier...

20:38.446 --> 20:40.562
- that we got in the first act?
- Yeah, what about them?

20:40.656 --> 20:42.818
Turns out they have a chemical
in them called purgenol

20:42.908 --> 20:44.740
that amplifies
all your violent tendencies.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.989
Oh, boy. Whew!
Thank goodness for that, huh?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.240
