Spare me your concern for my well-being

Our child. She was kind, clever, loving.

It's agony to remember.

came from that direction.

Probably that rooftop, maybe 600 lengths.

Excuse me, I'm speaking to you.

You can't ignore me, girl.
I'm the Princess.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.458
She must answer me.

06:30.333 --> 06:34.083
[servant] Leave her, Princess.
The girl cannot speak.

06:34.666 --> 06:38.333
She was injured.
Other children took her voice.

06:43.958 --> 06:49.916
Over thousands of years,
I've seen wonders and horrors, never this.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
The arrow was meant to kill her.
It should have killed her.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.291
So it missed some vital target.

06:56.375 --> 07:00.958
No. The Princess is somehow
dead and alive, all at once.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.666
Like a dream of death. Like a poem.

[teen Mirana] The girl saw
other servant children steal them from us.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.000
One overheard her tell her mother.

07:18.083 --> 07:22.541
She's small, weak.
So, they punished her. They hurt her.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.208
You must do something, Father.

07:25.291 --> 07:27.916
The throne should not abide
thieves or cruelty.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.541
There are many things
the throne should not abide, but must.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.208

Most of all, you can have
all the power in the world,

the people from themselves.

Even when you want to.
Even when it breaks your heart.

07:53.208 --> 07:56.875
Your father shouldn't be bothered
with the business of servants.

to what the girl endured.

They overstepped it. There was a cost.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.250
I see the little man couldn't be bothered
to visit her himself.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.875
There are security concerns.

14:52.958 --> 14:57.416
Obviously. He summoned half the army.
Always overcompensating.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.291
The Dragon Knight has an official request.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.125
Under the circumstances,
I think we should expedite it.

15:03.208 --> 15:05.833
I came to see the Emperor.
I need to see the Eye.

15:07.208 --> 15:10.958
I will arrange your meeting.
Praise the Dawn Star.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.791
You didn't sleep.

15:15.875 --> 15:19.958
[Davion] No. I, uh,
sometimes I have problems sleeping.

15:20.041 --> 15:22.791
This felt like it might be
one of those nights.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.125
I don't even understand
what she was doing here.

15:25.208 --> 15:31.958
That's a state secret. But at this point,
she was going to marry the Emperor.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.416
I need some air.

15:38.708 --> 15:41.541
Shabarra thought that marrying
the Princess would solve it all.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.125
In the short run, perhaps.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.750
In the end, it would have
only made things worse.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.791
So, a marriage of convenience.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.416
That's one point of view.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.583
You said it was a state secret.
Who knew about all this?

15:53.666 --> 15:57.750
Me, Kashurra, Asar,
and the Praetorian Guard, the War Council.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.416
Legatus Tihomir funded the effort
to return the Princess home.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.541
You mean, kidnap her.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.541
-That's also a point of view.
-And what's your point of view?

16:07.583 --> 16:10.875
Princess Mirana should never
have left the Nightsilver Woods.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.291
[Mirana] Honestly!

16:14.375 --> 16:19.125
This gown looks like the taffeta
came to life and decided to swallow me.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.708
[sighs]
Don't look at me that way, Marci.

16:21.791 --> 16:25.125
Of course, I appreciate
the complexities of dressmaking.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.541
I have to wear the dresses after all.

16:27.625 --> 16:30.541
But is it really too much to ask that…

16:30.625 --> 16:31.666
[gasps]

16:31.750 --> 16:33.500
[rumbling]

16:34.333 --> 16:36.166
[woman 2 grunts]

16:36.250 --> 16:38.166
-[breathing heavily]
-[leader soldier] Ready shield!

16:38.250 --> 16:40.458
[soldiers] Ready shields!

16:40.541 --> 16:42.041
[leader soldier] Ready arms!

16:42.125 --> 16:43.416
[soldiers] Ready arms!

16:45.625 --> 16:47.541
[indistinct clamoring]

16:47.625 --> 16:48.666
[soldiers grunting]

16:49.458 --> 16:52.875
[Asar] Your Highness, the Viceroy sent me.
We must leave.

16:53.625 --> 16:56.416
Mirana, your parents are dead.

16:57.291 --> 16:58.875
-[panting]
-[tense music playing]

17:01.291 --> 17:03.208
-[growls]
-[grunts]

17:05.458 --> 17:06.500
[soldier 2 screams]

17:09.458 --> 17:11.041
[soldier 3] Where is the Princess?

17:11.125 --> 17:13.833
[Asar] For the Dawn Star.

17:15.291 --> 17:17.625
[tense music continues playing]

17:17.708 --> 17:18.791
[gasps]

17:21.458 --> 17:22.583
[grunts]

17:22.666 --> 17:24.583
Marci! Ah!

17:25.291 --> 17:26.916
[breathing heavily]

17:32.333 --> 17:34.333
[grandiose music playing]

17:37.666 --> 17:38.833
[grunts]

17:59.791 --> 18:03.208
[Lina] Remember, make him feel
like he holds the cards.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.833
Then he'll listen.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.708
You really think about how this guy ticks.
His weaknesses.

18:07.791 --> 18:09.750
He gives you a lot to think about.

18:09.833 --> 18:16.000
The Emperor will see the Dragon Knight.
But only the Dragon Knight.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.958
I'll send the Emperor your best.

18:21.833 --> 18:25.958
[Shabarra] Davion the Dragon Knight.
You have something of a reputation.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.666
I understand you knew the Princess.

18:27.750 --> 18:32.291
No. Not "knew." I know her.
The Princess isn't dead.

18:32.375 --> 18:37.541
Nor is she alive. Or so I'm told.
And what brings you to my feet?

18:37.625 --> 18:41.208
As I told Viceroy Kashurra
when I requested this meeting, I need--

18:41.291 --> 18:46.416
The Eye. A relic so holy no one
has touched it in 3,000 years,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.125
other than the God Emperor.

18:48.208 --> 18:53.083
Yet you think I would just hand it
over to you, merely because you ask me.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.375
Amuse me with the reason.

18:55.458 --> 18:58.708
-It's complicated.
-[Shabarra] Simplify it for me.

18:58.791 --> 19:01.791
No king denies a request from our order.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.375
Our protection has always been
enough to ensure that.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.125
[Shabarra] Dragon Hold is rubble.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.375
You knights couldn't even
protect yourselves.

19:08.958 --> 19:09.958
Everyone out.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.125
[door opens]

19:12.875 --> 19:16.000
-I would love to help you. I would.
-[door closes]

19:16.083 --> 19:19.416
But you have to give me something
more than the Dragon Knight dodge.

19:20.541 --> 19:23.125
There's a demon. Terrorblade.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.708
He's killed all the Eldwyrms
and stolen their souls,

19:25.791 --> 19:28.166
all but the one hiding in my body.

19:28.250 --> 19:33.208
I need the Eye so that dragon can travel
to the hell of hells and stop Terrorblade

19:33.291 --> 19:36.166
from remaking the entire
gods-damned universe in his image.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.583
You could have just told me no.
[sighs]

19:41.666 --> 19:44.833
I'm afraid the Solar Throne
must deny your request.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.125
Please convey my kind regards to…

19:47.208 --> 19:49.416
[groans]
You choose.

19:50.166 --> 19:53.083
[Hieronimo]
Quite an unorthodox proposition.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.875
He collects the bounty on us
in exchange for Vanari's head.

19:58.166 --> 20:02.625
-You realize he will betray us.
-If he does, he dies first.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.958
-[crickets creaking]
-[whoosh]

20:09.125 --> 20:10.625
Wait for everyone.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.875
[foreboding music playing]

20:17.041 --> 20:18.833
You have no idea what you're doing.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.333
This isn't a little fight with a dragon.

20:22.416 --> 20:25.208
Your experience
with the nuance of divine power

20:25.291 --> 20:27.666
and executive authority is limited.

20:27.750 --> 20:32.333
There won't be a world.
Not for you, not for me, not for anyone.

20:32.416 --> 20:34.750
The Sun always rises.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.125
[Davion] The Princess.
Someone tried to kill her.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.791
I assume you plan
to do something about that.

20:41.875 --> 20:45.500
-I've tripled my security.
-I mean, the Princess.

20:45.583 --> 20:51.041
You failed to protect her. It should
have been you. Pathetic little mouse.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.208
"Mouse"? I am a god.

20:53.291 --> 20:56.833
[Slyvion] Even gods stand
below the pillars of creation.

20:56.916 --> 20:58.250
Guards.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.458
Majesty, come with me.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.000
[guards grunting]

21:04.666 --> 21:06.333
The Eye is ours.

21:06.416 --> 21:07.958
Balls.

21:08.041 --> 21:08.958
[Slyvion growls]

21:09.041 --> 21:10.250
[grunts]

21:10.333 --> 21:11.375
[choking]

21:11.458 --> 21:13.250
[groaning]

21:14.958 --> 21:16.833
[Shabarra yells]

21:18.250 --> 21:20.250
[tense music playing]

21:29.041 --> 21:30.958
[Shabarra screaming]

21:34.000 --> 21:35.916
[Slyvion snarls]

21:38.083 --> 21:41.708
[sniffs]
God Emperor Shabarra.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.583
You don't smell like a god.

21:43.666 --> 21:48.166
I, I can't. I can't give you
or anyone the Eye.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.083
[Slyvion growls]

21:49.166 --> 21:51.958
Please! When I took the throne,
I performed the ritual,

21:52.041 --> 21:55.041
but nothing happened. I wasn't worthy.

21:55.125 --> 21:58.916
If the Imperium learns the truth,
there will be civil war.

21:59.000 --> 21:59.875
[snarls]

22:04.375 --> 22:08.166
[growls]
Slaughter one another.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.666
[dramatic music playing]

22:16.000 --> 22:17.833
[Shabarra screaming]

22:29.625 --> 22:31.625
[suspenseful music playing]

22:38.250 --> 22:39.708
[Urlo] No, wait!

22:40.666 --> 22:41.750
Traitor.

22:41.833 --> 22:42.875
[Luna groans]

22:44.291 --> 22:46.416
[both grunting]

22:53.875 --> 22:54.708
[groans]

22:54.791 --> 22:58.583
[Vanari] Did you come
looking for answers? Revenge?

22:59.166 --> 23:02.333
Tell me, what do you see?
[growls]

23:04.583 --> 23:07.750
[grunts]
Stop! It is pointless to flee.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.625
[flare whistles]

23:16.041 --> 23:17.416
[growls]

23:19.166 --> 23:20.125
[groans]

23:21.083 --> 23:21.958
[in French]
Shit.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.875
[breathing heavily, grunts]

23:35.916 --> 23:37.708
[grunts, gasps]

23:45.625 --> 23:47.375
[Mirana in English]
You will help me?

23:47.458 --> 23:51.375
You will always be safe here.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.958
In my shadow.

23:53.750 --> 23:56.583
My Princess of the Moon.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
[closing theme music playing]
