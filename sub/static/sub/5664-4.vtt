00:00.458 --> 00:02.441
<i>Previously on</i> Sleepy Hollow:

00:02.442 --> 00:04.176
No, there's nothing in
here that might explain

00:04.177 --> 00:06.278
why the shard's so important
or who else might be involved.

00:06.279 --> 00:08.316
More people are gonna
come after this thing, Joe.

00:08.317 --> 00:11.175
We got to get ahead of that
by figuring out who they are.

00:11.176 --> 00:12.542
- I'm going to do it.
- Do what?

00:12.543 --> 00:15.311
Become a full citizen of this country.

00:15.312 --> 00:18.514
Ichabod Crane, American.
I like the sound of that.

00:18.515 --> 00:20.149
At the Academy, we helped

00:20.150 --> 00:22.140
push each other, made each other better.

00:22.141 --> 00:23.742
I'd like to try

00:23.743 --> 00:26.077
to find a way to keep that
working for the both of us.

00:26.078 --> 00:27.746
Betsy Ross? The flag woman?

00:27.747 --> 00:29.581
CRANE: <i>Betsy...</i>

00:29.582 --> 00:31.182
was a woman of many talents.

00:31.183 --> 00:33.852
ABBIE: <i>Betsy and Crane
kind of were a thing.</i>

00:33.853 --> 00:35.854
CRANE: <i>Pandora's box was
said to contain all</i>

00:35.855 --> 00:38.857
the evils in the world.
Which begs the question,

00:38.858 --> 00:41.192
which one does she have
in store for us next?

00:42.194 --> 00:43.828
(girls giggling)

00:43.829 --> 00:47.332
Are you using the purple?

00:47.333 --> 00:49.200
Here.

00:49.201 --> 00:50.869
Thank you.

00:50.870 --> 00:55.941
(giggling)

00:55.942 --> 01:00.645
Got ya! Come on. Lights out
means lights out, okay?

01:00.646 --> 01:03.148
Off you go.

01:06.686 --> 01:09.320
Hey.

01:10.890 --> 01:13.958
And... teeth brushed?

01:15.928 --> 01:18.163
Now go to bed, okay?

01:24.370 --> 01:26.604
(crickets chirping)

01:26.605 --> 01:28.973
(creaking in hallway)

01:31.377 --> 01:33.912
(growling)

01:33.913 --> 01:38.116
(screaming)

01:38.117 --> 01:40.985
(rapid gunfire on TV)

01:43.990 --> 01:45.991
ABBIE: Nice coaster.

01:45.992 --> 01:47.726
Have you thought about opening it?

01:47.727 --> 01:50.562
Your citizenship test is
at the end of the month.

01:50.563 --> 01:51.896
Lieutenant,

01:51.897 --> 01:53.898
if I have not yet belabored the point,

01:53.899 --> 01:55.400
allow me to endeavor.

01:55.401 --> 01:57.669
I do not need to study history.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.404
I lived it.

01:59.405 --> 02:00.706
You know they're gonna
test you on events

02:00.707 --> 02:01.816
that happened after 1781.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.883
They offer you four
options for every query.

02:03.884 --> 02:05.485
Multiple choice.

02:05.486 --> 02:07.620
It's practically a parlor game.

02:07.621 --> 02:09.823
Hmm.

02:09.824 --> 02:13.660
Okay. Pop quiz.

02:13.661 --> 02:15.297
"On what date was

02:15.298 --> 02:17.867
the Declaration of
Independence ratified?"

02:17.868 --> 02:20.158
- July the second, 1776.
- (imitates horn blowing)

02:20.159 --> 02:22.025
July Fourth.

02:22.026 --> 02:24.161
You know, Independence Day.

02:24.162 --> 02:26.430
Picnics, hot dogs, fireworks.

02:26.431 --> 02:28.165
Land of the drunk and free.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.900
Yes, I'm perfectly aware of the holiday.

02:29.901 --> 02:31.268
'Tis a symbolic representation.

02:31.269 --> 02:32.836
It need not be precise.

02:32.837 --> 02:36.240
No, the historically accurate
date is July the second.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.876
I should know. I attended the
second Continental Congress.

02:38.877 --> 02:40.144
I don't doubt it, Crane.

02:40.145 --> 02:41.945
But you're not being
tested on what happened.

02:41.946 --> 02:44.882
You are being tested on
what is in <i>Civics Today.</i>

02:44.883 --> 02:48.585
Oh. So 'tis not disgraceful
enough that I must implore

02:48.586 --> 02:50.902
to become a citizen of the
country I, in part, founded.

02:50.903 --> 02:54.372
I must also learn by rote
a compendium of solecisms

02:54.373 --> 02:56.541
masquerading as our nation's history?

02:56.542 --> 02:58.877
Welcome to America.

02:58.878 --> 03:02.314
Also, you got a text from Zoe.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.616
Oh.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.653
Ah, Miss Corinth has proofread

03:08.654 --> 03:12.357
my N400 form and says, 'tis good to go.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.826
I must say, she has made navigating

03:14.827 --> 03:19.030
the choppy briny of citizenship
a far more bearable undertaking.

03:19.031 --> 03:21.399
At a rate of 20 texts
a hour, I should hope

03:21.400 --> 03:23.034
that she's steering you
in the right direction.

03:23.035 --> 03:24.803
How do you know...?

03:24.804 --> 03:26.705
We share a roof, Crane.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.708
I know a lot of things I cannot unknow.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.011
Oh, on the subject of
invaluable communication,

03:33.012 --> 03:35.046
when, pray tell, did you intend to inform

03:35.047 --> 03:37.749
- Miss Jenny that you located your father?
- Hey.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.385
Things I cannot unknow.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.854
Well, it's complicated, Crane.

03:42.855 --> 03:46.391
My dad has a whole other
life now, a new family.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.193
Jenny took it really hard when he left.

03:48.194 --> 03:49.694
And she's in a good place now.

03:49.695 --> 03:51.463
And I don't want to
throw a wrench in that.

03:51.464 --> 03:56.134
You will make the right decision
at the right time, Lieutenant.

03:58.304 --> 04:02.974
(phone ringing)

04:02.975 --> 04:04.979
Hey, Joe. You find a name
for the mystery girl

04:04.980 --> 04:06.480
who's trying to steal our shard?

04:06.481 --> 04:08.415
Uh, well, your sister's asking around,

04:08.416 --> 04:10.184
but so far, no hits.

04:10.185 --> 04:13.120
Actually, I'm, uh... I'm
calling about something else.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.724
Look, I was just first
responder on a code three.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.692
A little girl fell into a coma.

04:19.694 --> 04:23.530
No one knows why, but...

04:23.531 --> 04:26.834
her sister claims that she
saw a monster attack her.

04:26.835 --> 04:30.837
What kind of monster?

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:40.682 --> 04:42.916
Hi, sweetie.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.752
It's a pretty doll.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.755
It's my sister's.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.058
Yeah.

04:51.059 --> 04:53.760
It's awful what happened to her.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.897
But you don't worry, sweetheart.

04:56.898 --> 05:00.067
Your sister is going to be just fine.

05:21.923 --> 05:24.424
Hi, Saffron.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.294
I'm Abbie.

05:27.295 --> 05:29.129
This is <i>my</i> sister, Jenny.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.697
We wanted to talk to you about what

05:30.698 --> 05:33.066
you saw in your bedroom,
if that's all right.

05:36.871 --> 05:40.307
And we wanted to tell you
that we think you're very brave

05:40.308 --> 05:42.442
for telling everyone what you saw.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.945
I know how hard it is to
open up about something

05:44.946 --> 05:46.446
when no one believes you.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.216
Especially something scary like this.

05:49.217 --> 05:53.220
And if you do want to talk
about the monster you saw,

05:53.221 --> 05:55.255
we're here to listen.

05:57.125 --> 06:01.762
JENNY: <i>Well, she's still
pretty traumatized, so</i>

06:01.763 --> 06:03.030
there's not much to go on,

06:03.031 --> 06:05.132
but my gut tells me
that she saw something.

06:05.133 --> 06:07.634
Mine, too. But we need more information.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.770
We must keep this incident contained.

06:09.771 --> 06:12.406
If Pandora's behind it, as I fear,

06:12.407 --> 06:15.042
widespread panic is her desire.

06:19.948 --> 06:22.482
(phone ringing)

06:22.483 --> 06:24.952
Reynolds.

06:24.953 --> 06:27.487
It's Abbie. I got a weird call last night

06:27.488 --> 06:29.756
involving a peeping Tom and some kids.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.858
Probably nothing, but I
said I'd check it out.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.660
If you're looking for more work, Abbs,

06:33.661 --> 06:34.928
I've inherited quite a backlog.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.630
Couple of hours, I promise.

06:36.631 --> 06:37.798
Just check in with me later.

06:37.799 --> 06:40.667
You got it, Danny. Thank you.

06:40.668 --> 06:44.805
You two start in the girls' bedroom.

06:44.806 --> 06:47.474
I shall try my luck with
the young Miss Saffron.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.876
(birds singing)

06:52.880 --> 06:55.882
This reminds me of our room
when we lived on Lindbrook.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.284
But without the boat window.

06:57.285 --> 06:59.786
Boat window?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.655
Come on, you remember.
The boat window.

07:01.656 --> 07:03.257
I guess I was too young.

07:03.258 --> 07:05.459
The circular window above my bed?

07:05.460 --> 07:07.294
We used to pretend it was a porthole.

07:07.295 --> 07:09.029
- (laughs)
- Imagine

07:09.030 --> 07:11.365
we were on a boat going somewhere else.

07:11.366 --> 07:13.133
Somewhere far away I bet.

07:13.134 --> 07:15.135
It was actually Dad's idea.

07:15.136 --> 07:18.105
We used to pretend like we were
going on an adventure together.

07:18.106 --> 07:20.674
I think that he wanted us to know

07:20.675 --> 07:23.110
that there was a big world
outside of Sleepy Hollow for us

07:23.111 --> 07:25.712
to explore and that we
could leave if we wanted.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.948
Well, he certainly took his own advice.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.851
You ever think of Dad?

07:30.852 --> 07:34.421
Pretty much never...
which I'm confident is mutual.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.392
People change.

07:38.393 --> 07:40.727
Not people like that.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.196
They just get better at hiding it.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.832
Or they drink themselves to death.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.272
(birds singing)

07:52.273 --> 07:55.509
(knocking)

08:02.850 --> 08:04.851
Have you seen my quarter?

08:04.852 --> 08:07.487
I could have sworn I had a quarter.

08:09.190 --> 08:13.059
(loudly): You appear to be
a little hard of hearing.

08:15.430 --> 08:18.332
Oh.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.333
Oh!

08:21.569 --> 08:23.203
Oh!

08:23.204 --> 08:24.938
Little wonder.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.841
You had a silver specie
nestled in your ear!

08:27.842 --> 08:30.243
It was your hand the whole time.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.846
Right.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.751
There once was a lady from Cork

08:38.753 --> 08:41.688
whose pa made a fortune in pork.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.990
He bought for his daughter
a tutor who taught her

08:43.991 --> 08:46.593
to balance green peas on her... Ouch!

08:46.594 --> 08:50.931
- Oh.
- (laughing)

08:50.932 --> 08:55.268
You have rather a sadistic
sense of humor, don't you?

08:59.006 --> 09:04.177
My dad thinks I'm making the monster up.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.213
He's my dad.

09:06.214 --> 09:08.515
He's supposed to believe me.

09:13.087 --> 09:18.258
Perhaps if you drew
for him what you saw,

09:18.259 --> 09:21.761
you might help him believe
what he cannot see.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.406
This is what she saw.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.647
Saffron, who is this a drawing of?

09:40.648 --> 09:43.416
The Tooth Fairy.

10:20.662 --> 10:24.232
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

10:26.563 --> 10:27.730
The Tooth Fairy.

10:27.773 --> 10:29.340
Isn't she supposed to be some kind,

10:29.341 --> 10:31.175
sweet woman with a magic wand?

10:31.176 --> 10:33.811
Many fairy tales are derived
from darker origins.

10:33.812 --> 10:35.847
Subsequently lost in translation.

10:35.848 --> 10:37.949
I do not recall Disney's <i>Cinderella</i>

10:37.950 --> 10:40.651
featuring the wicked sisters
cutting off their own feet.

10:40.652 --> 10:42.420
So we know the PG version
of the Tooth Fairy.

10:42.421 --> 10:43.955
Now we got to figure out the real one.

10:43.956 --> 10:46.924
I may have some insight on that matter.

10:46.925 --> 10:48.960
The loss of a child's tooth.

10:48.961 --> 10:51.362
I've seen it be harbinger
to an identical tragedy.

10:51.363 --> 10:55.700
One that nearly destroyed Betsy Ross.

10:57.669 --> 11:00.096
<i>Betsy's niece had succumbed</i>

11:00.097 --> 11:03.366
<i>to an unconscious state that
no physician could diagnose.</i>

11:05.403 --> 11:07.470
<i>A mysterious illness,</i>

11:07.471 --> 11:10.674
<i>affecting only the
children of our township,</i>

11:10.675 --> 11:12.679
<i>from which no child was safe</i>

11:12.680 --> 11:16.249
<i>and there was no cure.</i>

11:16.250 --> 11:19.085
♪

11:20.922 --> 11:23.924
Betsy was trying to stay
strong <i>for her nephew,</i>

11:23.925 --> 11:26.415
<i>her family, but she was
absolutely distraught.</i>

11:26.416 --> 11:28.718
<i>Briefly, I thought I might be the one</i>

11:28.719 --> 11:30.785
<i>to help her through this harrowing time,</i>

11:30.786 --> 11:34.337
<i>until I realized she
called upon someone else.</i>

11:34.338 --> 11:36.139
- Ichabod.
- Mr. Revere.

11:36.140 --> 11:37.707
<i>Paul Revere.</i>

11:37.708 --> 11:40.617
<i>Revere, a dentist as
well as a silversmith,</i>

11:40.618 --> 11:43.004
<i>was making a house visit
to Betsy's niece.</i>

11:43.005 --> 11:46.730
<i>16 children in the area had
died following the same coma.</i>

11:48.784 --> 11:50.569
<i>All, like Betsy's niece...</i>

11:50.570 --> 11:52.337
Trade you.

11:52.338 --> 11:55.907
<i>...right after the loss
of a deciduous tooth.</i>

12:05.651 --> 12:06.984
Betsy?

12:06.985 --> 12:09.386
You shouldn't be here.

12:13.493 --> 12:15.393
(brief crackle)

12:16.729 --> 12:18.662
I didn't know then that Revere

12:18.663 --> 12:21.700
was a soldier in the
supernatural war against evil.

12:21.701 --> 12:24.035
Shortly after his visit,

12:24.036 --> 12:27.038
Betsy's niece made a full recovery.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.708
So Revere had a cure, or he
might've killed the thing.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.843
Precisely. Whichever the solution,

12:31.844 --> 12:33.745
it lay hidden

12:33.746 --> 12:35.747
in his dentistry bag.

12:35.748 --> 12:37.682
It appears as though Revere
used his orthodontics

12:37.683 --> 12:40.786
as a cover for his
supernatural activities.

12:40.787 --> 12:43.651
Mind you, having experienced
his dental work firsthand,

12:43.652 --> 12:46.286
it makes infinitely more sense.

12:46.287 --> 12:49.322
Crane hasn't been to a dentist
since he's been here.

12:49.323 --> 12:50.757
And that is no oversight.

12:50.758 --> 12:52.469
My jaw aches

12:52.470 --> 12:54.471
just thinking of how
Revere manhandled me.

12:54.472 --> 12:56.607
You know, there have been
a lot of improvements

12:56.608 --> 12:58.442
in the dental industry
since the 18th century.

12:58.443 --> 13:00.277
And I have no interest in any of them.

13:00.278 --> 13:03.881
Okay, then I'm gonna try
and find Paul Revere's

13:03.882 --> 13:05.516
not-dentist bag.

13:05.517 --> 13:08.018
Ah. Here. "The Tooth Fairy Legend

13:08.019 --> 13:10.287
"and Origin of the Abyzou,

13:10.288 --> 13:13.156
an Assyrian demon that
eats children's souls."

13:13.157 --> 13:15.759
ABBIE: "A child's open wound
serves as a beacon for the Abyzou,

13:15.760 --> 13:18.762
allowing them to harvest
the child's life force."

13:18.763 --> 13:21.565
"A process which takes
48 hours to complete."

13:21.566 --> 13:23.667
So Tessa has 36 hours left.

13:23.668 --> 13:26.103
"The Abyzou were nocturnal, territorial

13:26.104 --> 13:29.339
"predators that often steal
their victim's teeth

13:29.340 --> 13:31.308
- as trophies."
- "While Abyzou are

13:31.309 --> 13:35.445
"nearly impossible to defeat,
their one weakness...

13:35.446 --> 13:37.547
is silver."

13:38.449 --> 13:39.950
Of course.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.521
Revere gave Betsy's
nephew a silver dollar.

13:44.522 --> 13:46.557
(snaps fingers) In fact,
it soon became commonplace

13:46.558 --> 13:49.326
for parents to give their
children dimes, silver dollars,

13:49.327 --> 13:51.461
reals when they lost a tooth,

13:51.462 --> 13:54.197
in lieu of the standard copper penny.

13:54.198 --> 13:55.866
So Revere started using the silver coins

13:55.867 --> 13:58.135
to ward off the Abyzou.

13:58.136 --> 14:00.304
And why is there no picture?

14:00.305 --> 14:02.339
It says here the Abyzou was invisible.

14:02.340 --> 14:03.941
Well, what about Saffron's drawing?

14:03.942 --> 14:06.443
- She saw a monster.
- CRANE: It could be both...

14:06.444 --> 14:08.946
if the creature is visible...

14:08.947 --> 14:11.348
but only to children.

14:15.486 --> 14:18.388
Open up. Let's see how we're doing.

14:18.389 --> 14:20.157
(soft gasp)

14:20.158 --> 14:21.358
Pretty close.

14:21.359 --> 14:22.993
Want me to pull it out?

14:22.994 --> 14:24.361
- Mm-mm.
- (laughs softly)

14:24.362 --> 14:27.497
Okay. Good night, pumpkin.

14:33.538 --> 14:35.339
(low growling)

14:35.340 --> 14:37.140
Mom! Mom!

14:37.141 --> 14:38.308
What? What is it?

14:38.309 --> 14:40.010
There's a monster in there!

14:40.011 --> 14:41.378
I saw!

14:41.379 --> 14:43.013
Honey, what are you talking about?

14:43.014 --> 14:44.481
There's no such thing as monsters.

14:44.482 --> 14:45.349
Here, I'll show you.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.616
No! Don't!

14:53.791 --> 14:56.493
No more scary movies, okay?

15:09.007 --> 15:12.109
♪

15:29.927 --> 15:31.995
(floor creaks quietly)

15:50.248 --> 15:52.049
- (growls)
- (screaming)

15:52.050 --> 15:54.184
(snarls)

15:55.987 --> 15:58.088
(low growling)

16:03.609 --> 16:04.424
What if we said

16:04.425 --> 16:05.934
it was an epidemic?

16:05.935 --> 16:07.536
They could quarantine the kids.

16:07.537 --> 16:09.471
An ordeal of that measure would involve

16:09.472 --> 16:12.474
incredible local, if not
national, attention.

16:12.475 --> 16:15.477
The exact kind of panic
Pandora wishes to provoke.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.813
Yeah, you're right.

16:17.814 --> 16:20.783
Okay, let's think. What do
we know about the Abyzou?

16:20.784 --> 16:23.552
It is invisible to adults.

16:23.553 --> 16:26.155
It preys on children
who just lost a tooth.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.723
It's territorial.

16:27.724 --> 16:29.625
All the victims in the past

16:29.626 --> 16:32.961
lived within a small community,
within a five-mile radius.

16:32.962 --> 16:35.197
Okay. It looks like there's only one

16:35.198 --> 16:38.434
elementary school within
ten miles of the Paynters.

16:38.435 --> 16:41.136
We should go down there,
suss out what children

16:41.137 --> 16:42.971
are close to losing a tooth.

16:42.972 --> 16:46.074
How do we do that
without raising suspicion?

16:46.976 --> 16:49.077
I have an idea.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.514
Students.

16:52.515 --> 16:56.618
We have a very special
surprise guest speaker today.

16:56.619 --> 16:59.254
Please give a very warm
welcome to Ichabod Crane,

16:59.255 --> 17:03.092
curator of the new Hudson
Valley Historical Society.

17:03.093 --> 17:05.861
CHILDREN: Hello, Ichabod Crane.

17:05.862 --> 17:07.762
Thank you... for that...

17:07.763 --> 17:09.431
warm welcome.

17:09.432 --> 17:12.034
It is most heartening to see
how the educational system

17:12.035 --> 17:13.635
has evolved over the years,

17:13.636 --> 17:16.271
and all without the threat of the rod.

17:17.473 --> 17:19.141
(chuckles): This is too good.

17:19.142 --> 17:21.143
Now, if you'll allow me
to start today by setting

17:21.144 --> 17:23.679
a few historical inaccuracies
right about our first president,

17:23.680 --> 17:26.281
George Washington, a great man.

17:26.281 --> 17:28.117
But who is not, in fact,

17:28.117 --> 17:29.618
the wealthiest man in America.

17:29.619 --> 17:32.187
He did not farm his own hemp.

17:32.188 --> 17:34.289
Although he did partake
in laudanum tincture

17:34.290 --> 17:35.858
from time to time...

17:35.859 --> 17:37.639
- but who didn't?
- (teacher clears throat)

17:39.162 --> 17:43.432
And he did not have wooden teeth.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.167
Now...

17:45.168 --> 17:49.705
who can tell me who George
Washington's dentist was?

17:49.706 --> 17:51.273
Anyone.

17:51.274 --> 17:53.208
Anyone.

17:53.209 --> 17:54.676
No?

17:54.677 --> 17:58.213
Has anyone heard of Paul Revere?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.113
You.

18:00.114 --> 18:02.951
Isn't that the guy who
did the Midnight Ride?

18:02.952 --> 18:05.220
Yes! The very same. Well done.

18:05.221 --> 18:07.022
Now, an important question.

18:07.023 --> 18:10.425
Which of you has ever lost a tooth?

18:10.426 --> 18:12.261
Ah...

18:14.063 --> 18:18.634
And which of you has a
loose tooth right now?

18:27.043 --> 18:28.443
(bell rings)

18:28.444 --> 18:31.079
TEACHER: Okay, kids,

18:31.080 --> 18:33.048
that's it for today.
How about a nice round

18:33.049 --> 18:34.950
of applause for Mr. Ichabod Crane.

18:43.593 --> 18:45.594
Is everything okay

18:45.595 --> 18:48.163
with that boy? Gregory?

18:48.164 --> 18:50.265
Oh, he's just a little woozy.

18:50.266 --> 18:52.901
Actually, he's very close
to losing a tooth.

18:52.902 --> 18:55.304
Maybe the assembly was
a little much for him.

18:55.305 --> 18:56.371
Oh.

18:56.372 --> 18:58.440
(quietly): Thank you.

19:00.109 --> 19:02.844
JENNY: Gregory.

19:04.848 --> 19:06.348
Hey.

19:06.349 --> 19:10.319
I want you to take this.

19:12.589 --> 19:16.258
It'll protect you against the
things that only you can see.

19:16.259 --> 19:17.859
You understand?

19:18.828 --> 19:20.595
(softly): Good.

19:23.266 --> 19:26.235
That's who we need to watch tonight.

19:26.236 --> 19:28.804
And Sarah Fogel.
Do we have the location

19:28.805 --> 19:30.439
- of Revere's bag?
- Yes.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.341
It's at the Colonial Raleigh Museum.

19:32.342 --> 19:34.076
Abbie's throwing her FBI weight around

19:34.077 --> 19:36.278
trying to get it shipped to us overnight.

19:36.279 --> 19:37.980
The silver coins are a good repellent,

19:37.981 --> 19:40.315
but we have to find a
way to kill this thing.

19:40.316 --> 19:43.285
If silver is the Abyzou's foible,

19:43.286 --> 19:47.122
perhaps a weapon of that
nature can deal a fatal blow.

19:48.791 --> 19:51.393
No, sir, I am actually
acutely aware of the fact

19:51.394 --> 19:55.230
that this is a delicate
and valuable relic.

19:55.231 --> 19:57.332
I have a feeling the
Colonial Raleigh Museum

19:57.333 --> 19:59.334
is not impressed with
Abbie's FBI status.

19:59.335 --> 20:02.170
ABBIE: I happen to have
greater reverence

20:02.171 --> 20:05.574
for historical artifacts
than you could ever imagine.

20:05.575 --> 20:07.409
How now, my name is Ichabod Crane,

20:07.410 --> 20:09.177
curator of the soon to be

20:09.178 --> 20:11.213
Hudson Valley Historical
Society and Armory.

20:11.214 --> 20:12.648
How do you fare?

20:12.649 --> 20:15.350
Superlative. You see,

20:15.351 --> 20:17.319
the reason for this summon in sooth

20:17.320 --> 20:19.187
is that this weekend
is our grand opening,

20:19.188 --> 20:22.491
and we were so hoping,
perhaps a little beetle-headely,

20:22.492 --> 20:25.794
that Paul Revere's
dentistry bag could be

20:25.795 --> 20:28.463
the featured article in
our premiere exhibition...

20:28.464 --> 20:32.300
Forging the Forefathers:
The Men Behind the Masters.

20:37.307 --> 20:40.142
Blessed be your heart.

20:40.143 --> 20:43.312
Yes, first thing on the
morrow would be divine.

20:43.313 --> 20:46.915
I can give you the address,
if you have a quill.

20:49.485 --> 20:51.219
CRANE (over walkie-talkie): Lieutenant,

20:51.220 --> 20:53.922
any activity outside
young Gregory's home?

20:53.923 --> 20:55.257
Nope. All quiet

20:55.258 --> 20:57.426
on the Abyzou front. You?

21:00.196 --> 21:02.230
- Much the same.
- (slurping loudly)

21:02.231 --> 21:04.132
- (slurping)
- You know, you mainline

21:04.133 --> 21:06.201
a lot of sugar for a guy

21:06.202 --> 21:08.870
who won't get his teeth cleaned.

21:10.606 --> 21:13.275
(phone chimes)

21:13.276 --> 21:17.145
JOE: You're back in the saddle, huh?

21:17.146 --> 21:19.715
Jenny finally set you up?

21:19.716 --> 21:22.250
Beg your pardon?

21:22.251 --> 21:23.652
Don't worry, I've been through it, too.

21:23.653 --> 21:26.555
The Mills sisters are great
at killing monsters,

21:26.556 --> 21:29.458
but their true passion
lies in matchmaking.

21:29.459 --> 21:32.928
Word to the wise... if they try
to hook you up with Diane...

21:32.929 --> 21:34.496
run.

21:34.497 --> 21:37.165
If you are referring to Miss Corinth,

21:37.166 --> 21:39.601
she is guiding me
through the procurement

21:39.602 --> 21:42.237
of my citizenship.

21:44.273 --> 21:45.707
She is a dragoman,

21:45.708 --> 21:48.810
an advisor, a-a tutor.

21:48.811 --> 21:50.479
Nothing more.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.949
Yes, I had a math tutor
in high school... Fred.

21:53.950 --> 21:55.884
We didn't text every two minutes.

21:55.885 --> 21:58.887
And if we did, we wouldn't have
used that little monkey emoji

21:58.888 --> 22:00.255
where he covers his eyes.

22:04.093 --> 22:06.595
Mr. Corbin...

22:06.596 --> 22:10.265
in my experience, obfuscating
a working relationship

22:10.266 --> 22:12.834
by indulging in auxiliary feelings

22:12.835 --> 22:15.904
can become rather... complicated.

22:17.707 --> 22:19.041
I don't know.

22:19.042 --> 22:22.144
Sounds like you're overthinking it.

22:22.145 --> 22:25.113
As is my way.

22:25.114 --> 22:27.716
I know, baby. I miss you, too.

22:27.717 --> 22:28.984
Here.

22:28.985 --> 22:30.452
Yep. Yeah.

22:30.453 --> 22:31.620
Lisa...

22:31.621 --> 22:33.955
Oh, it's just not that easy.

22:33.956 --> 22:35.557
- Please?
- What? Hold on.

22:35.558 --> 22:37.559
What is with you tonight?

22:37.560 --> 22:39.895
I just want you to watch with me.

22:40.863 --> 22:43.198
(sighs) All right,

22:43.199 --> 22:45.567
I'll make you a deal.
You give me ten minutes

22:45.568 --> 22:47.169
to finish up my phone call,

22:47.170 --> 22:49.237
I will take you out for ice cream.

22:49.238 --> 22:50.205
Does that sound fun?

22:50.206 --> 22:51.940
Ten minutes, okay?

22:53.242 --> 22:54.543
BABYSITTER: Yeah.

22:54.544 --> 22:56.545
No. He's ridiculous.

22:56.546 --> 23:00.015
(insects chittering)

23:00.016 --> 23:01.550
Jen?

23:03.453 --> 23:06.822
I have something I want to tell you,

23:06.823 --> 23:09.457
and I don't think you're gonna like it.

23:14.230 --> 23:16.264
I found Dad.

23:16.265 --> 23:19.201
(exhales, laughs)

23:19.202 --> 23:21.703
Yeah, I knew something was up.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.572
I found him five years ago.

23:23.573 --> 23:26.508
He moved around a lot
before he remarried.

23:26.509 --> 23:29.211
Pamela. Stepson Walter.

23:29.212 --> 23:32.514
Really sold them a bill of goods.

23:32.515 --> 23:35.016
Five years?

23:35.017 --> 23:37.085
I've been feeling guilty
for not telling you

23:37.086 --> 23:39.087
for two months, and you've known

23:39.088 --> 23:40.622
- for five years?
- Oh, come on,

23:40.623 --> 23:42.524
what was I supposed to say?

23:42.525 --> 23:44.593
The guy who wants nothing to do with us

23:44.594 --> 23:46.428
has a new address and family?

23:46.429 --> 23:49.064
I thought it would upset you.
I know how much you hate him.

23:49.065 --> 23:52.334
I don't hate him. I'm trying
to have an open mind.

23:52.335 --> 23:54.503
You're the one who can't stop
talking about how horrible he is.

23:54.504 --> 23:56.238
Because that's what you've
told me my whole life.

23:56.239 --> 23:57.839
- Come on!
- He left

23:57.840 --> 24:00.942
when I was three...
I barely even remember the guy.

24:00.943 --> 24:03.044
I only hate him because you hate him.

24:03.045 --> 24:05.180
You said he ruined our childhood.

24:05.181 --> 24:08.550
(scoffs) You want to
reconnect with that deadbeat?

24:08.551 --> 24:09.885
Go ahead.

24:09.886 --> 24:11.219
Just don't come crying to me

24:11.220 --> 24:13.154
when it turns out he's still a jerk.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.234
- (snarling)
- (yelling)

24:27.170 --> 24:28.270
It's go time.

24:29.172 --> 24:31.206
(growling)

24:36.779 --> 24:38.780
(hisses)

24:44.861 --> 24:46.087
Hey. Where's the monster, Greg?

24:46.088 --> 24:47.355
- Show us.
- There!

24:47.356 --> 24:49.157
- JENNY: Where?
- GREG: To the left!

24:49.158 --> 24:50.792
Where is it now?

24:50.793 --> 24:53.161
- Right!
- JENNY: I can't see it.

24:53.162 --> 24:54.396
(growling)

24:54.397 --> 24:56.398
GREG: In front of you!

24:56.399 --> 24:58.500
(hissing)

24:58.501 --> 24:59.601
There it is!

25:04.273 --> 25:06.942
Wow! Okay. Someone's
excited for ice cream.

25:06.943 --> 25:08.843
Let's go, you little monster.

25:09.512 --> 25:10.812
Did you see that?

25:10.813 --> 25:13.114
I got an idea.

25:15.785 --> 25:18.520
- (growling)
- There!

25:22.091 --> 25:24.025
Jenny?

25:24.026 --> 25:25.260
(groans)

25:36.672 --> 25:39.207
Abbie!

25:39.208 --> 25:40.742
Abbie.

25:40.743 --> 25:42.477
Abbie.

25:43.813 --> 25:45.580
Abbie! Abbie.

25:53.141 --> 25:55.475
CRANE: She is strong, Miss Jenny.

25:56.778 --> 25:58.412
The strongest person I've ever known

25:58.413 --> 26:00.313
in this or any other time.

26:04.252 --> 26:08.121
Clearly, our limited knowledge
of the Abyzou has led us astray.

26:08.122 --> 26:10.324
Silver may repel the beast,

26:10.325 --> 26:13.593
but it by no means
inflicts a mortal wound.

26:13.594 --> 26:15.295
I should like to return to the Archives,

26:15.296 --> 26:16.596
examine the texts further.

26:16.597 --> 26:18.165
There may be a detail we missed.

26:18.166 --> 26:21.668
I'm gonna stick around
here for a bit longer.

26:21.669 --> 26:24.438
Of course.

26:31.212 --> 26:33.113
Lieutenant?

26:35.616 --> 26:39.119
Your duty in this battle is now to heal.

26:41.022 --> 26:44.324
This is not your time, dear friend.

26:52.367 --> 26:55.168
♪

27:15.690 --> 27:18.291
What happened to your sister?

27:19.560 --> 27:21.895
She got hurt.

27:22.864 --> 27:24.398
The doctors told my parents

27:24.399 --> 27:26.933
they don't think my
sister's gonna wake up.

27:29.370 --> 27:31.571
I'm her big sister. I was
supposed to protect her.

27:31.572 --> 27:33.240
This is all my fault.

27:33.241 --> 27:35.976
Hey.

27:35.977 --> 27:38.245
You know, when Abbie and
I were about your age,

27:38.246 --> 27:41.448
we got into this huge fight. (chuckles)

27:41.449 --> 27:45.252
We didn't talk for a long, long time.

27:45.253 --> 27:47.721
But now, whenever I think about Abbie,

27:47.722 --> 27:51.391
I never think about that fight.

27:51.392 --> 27:53.894
I just think of the good times

27:53.895 --> 27:56.897
and all the ways she's
been such a great sister.

27:56.898 --> 27:58.865
That's how I think about her,

27:58.866 --> 28:01.334
and that's how Tessa thinks about you.

28:01.335 --> 28:04.137
Because you're her big sister.

28:04.138 --> 28:07.073
There's no one she loves more than you.

28:08.142 --> 28:10.310
And nothing in the world...

28:10.311 --> 28:14.114
no monster, no evil...

28:14.115 --> 28:16.516
can ever change that.

28:17.452 --> 28:18.685
You and I,

28:18.686 --> 28:20.187
we're gonna have many more

28:20.188 --> 28:22.222
happy years together with our sisters.

28:24.058 --> 28:26.393
I promise.

28:40.775 --> 28:42.876
PANDORA: So many words

28:42.877 --> 28:46.413
and empty promises these
adults of yours make.

28:46.414 --> 28:48.682
Huh?

28:48.683 --> 28:51.685
I don't even know how they
keep it all straight,

28:51.686 --> 28:55.121
seeing as they don't believe you.

28:57.225 --> 28:59.326
I believe you.

29:00.461 --> 29:02.896
And if you've a mind to,

29:02.897 --> 29:05.865
I know what you can do to help
make your sister all better.

29:20.348 --> 29:21.781
JENNY: So, what do you we got?

29:21.782 --> 29:24.651
Would you believe it?
Actual dentistry tools.

29:24.652 --> 29:26.153
They call to mind
many a torturous memory

29:26.154 --> 29:28.955
but bring us no closer
to defeating the Abyzou.

29:28.956 --> 29:31.992
Oh, Revere and his secrets.

29:31.993 --> 29:34.127
He was too clever by half.

29:34.128 --> 29:37.764
Everything is masked
by a cipher or a riddle,

29:37.765 --> 29:40.834
or buried beneath one of
his banal colloquialisms.

29:40.835 --> 29:42.502
"Nothing is as it seems."

29:42.503 --> 29:44.538
"The forest for the trees."

29:44.539 --> 29:47.874
"The whole is greater than
the sum of its parts."

29:49.343 --> 29:52.112
"The sum of its parts."

30:03.891 --> 30:05.525
These tools fit together.

30:06.694 --> 30:09.362
They create a greater contraption.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.985
CRANE: <i>Revere used these
parts to build a weapon,</i>

30:31.986 --> 30:34.721
<i>one that could defeat the Abyzou.</i>

30:34.722 --> 30:36.923
<i>Dentist tools provided the perfect cover,</i>

30:36.924 --> 30:40.026
<i>but he needed something more: ammunition.</i>

30:42.330 --> 30:44.064
<i>Silver.</i>

30:44.065 --> 30:46.266
Not for filling teeth

30:46.267 --> 30:48.902
and not for killing the Abyzou.

30:50.905 --> 30:53.006
<i>Something else, then.</i>

30:53.007 --> 30:55.342
If only I knew what
happened behind that door.

30:58.412 --> 31:00.714
<i>There was a flash of light.</i>

31:00.715 --> 31:02.649
JENNY: <i>Silver nitrate.</i>

31:02.650 --> 31:04.918
An explosive chemical compound

31:04.919 --> 31:07.954
used in experiments with
early flash photography.

31:07.955 --> 31:11.258
So silver nitrate creates a flash of light.

31:11.259 --> 31:14.294
And there are trace
amounts of it in water,

31:14.295 --> 31:16.263
which would explain why Abbie and I

31:16.264 --> 31:18.898
briefly saw the Abyzou's form
back at the Gonda house.

31:18.899 --> 31:23.336
So silver exposes the Abyzou and
leaves it vulnerable to attack.

31:23.337 --> 31:26.439
It must have a weak point, a
kill shot that you have to see.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.841
That's how silver weakens it.

31:27.842 --> 31:30.176
And that's how we kill it.

31:30.177 --> 31:32.278
(humming a tune)

32:10.574 --> 32:11.874
Hello, Sleepyhead.

32:20.465 --> 32:22.376
What the hell are you doing here?

32:22.377 --> 32:23.243
Shh.

32:23.244 --> 32:25.045
There's no need for that.

32:26.748 --> 32:29.449
There's no need for any of it.

32:29.450 --> 32:31.585
But we fight

32:31.586 --> 32:34.621
and we fight and we fight, don't we?

32:34.622 --> 32:36.623
And then we get hurt.

32:36.624 --> 32:39.993
Poor thing.

32:39.994 --> 32:43.463
As long as you keep attacking children...

32:43.464 --> 32:46.333
I will keep fighting.

32:46.334 --> 32:51.071
You're not like the others, are you?

32:51.072 --> 32:53.573
And you don't crave mortality.

32:53.574 --> 32:56.276
Not your own or your sister's

32:56.277 --> 32:58.278
or even your fellow <i>Napalutu.</i>

32:58.279 --> 32:59.279
(echoing): Napalutu...

32:59.280 --> 33:01.248
And yet you fight.

33:01.249 --> 33:06.219
You fight like you have
something to lose.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.722
So what is it, my brave one?

33:08.723 --> 33:11.091
What is the one pesky thing

33:11.092 --> 33:13.727
that you cannot accept

33:13.728 --> 33:15.562
to lose?

33:15.563 --> 33:17.931
It can't be your mother.

33:17.932 --> 33:20.367
<i>We know what happened to her.</i>

33:22.270 --> 33:24.371
<i>Then what about your father?</i>

33:25.640 --> 33:27.207
(monitor beeping faster)

33:29.577 --> 33:31.011
Mm.

33:32.847 --> 33:34.915
God spoke to my father.

33:34.916 --> 33:37.250
Told him to beat me.

33:37.251 --> 33:39.352
Until I forgot all language.

33:41.689 --> 33:46.493
When I tired of it...

33:46.494 --> 33:49.362
he sold me to slavery,

33:49.363 --> 33:52.966
boasting of my prelapsarian innocence.

33:52.967 --> 33:55.735
But then...

33:55.736 --> 33:57.604
when I learned how to speak again,

33:57.605 --> 34:01.041
I convinced my owner to
feed my father to his lion.

34:02.343 --> 34:05.412
And it was sadder than I expected.

34:08.248 --> 34:10.717
But I suppose that's
that parent-child bond.

34:14.355 --> 34:17.190
Well... I do hope

34:17.190 --> 34:18.625
that you didn't grow too attached

34:18.626 --> 34:20.393

who should apologize.

I appear to have mistaken
a certain intimacy

fetch my timber plank

I suggest you wait to respond.

40:01.222 --> 40:05.158

But I also know

41:10.959 --> 41:14.728
that no matter what...

41:14.729 --> 41:17.064
we're gonna be fine.

41:19.467 --> 41:22.135
No fight is ever gonna
keep us apart again.

41:25.873 --> 41:29.543
So, what do you want to do?

41:29.544 --> 41:31.511
You want to talk to him?

41:31.512 --> 41:33.080
(sighs)

41:33.081 --> 41:35.015
I do.

41:35.016 --> 41:37.684
But then, I think about
his, you know, new life,

41:37.685 --> 41:40.153
new family, his kid.

41:40.154 --> 41:42.956
I don't want to screw
that up for anyone.

41:42.957 --> 41:45.125
Not even him.

41:45.126 --> 41:47.094
Well, you know, we don't need to.

41:47.095 --> 41:48.962
We got each other.

41:48.963 --> 41:51.565
That's all that matters.

41:51.566 --> 41:54.501
Mm.

41:55.703 --> 41:58.972
- Find anything?
- Yes.

41:58.973 --> 42:00.941
Though it is rather disconcerting.

42:00.942 --> 42:03.310
The word Pandora spoke to you, "Napalutu"

42:03.311 --> 42:06.346
is Sumerian for "destroyers."

42:06.347 --> 42:09.983
The very same word engraved
on our prophesied tablet.

42:09.984 --> 42:12.753
So this isn't the mythical
Pandora of ancient Greek fame?

42:12.754 --> 42:14.988
Pandora is an archetypal figure,

42:14.989 --> 42:17.157
present in a plethora of cultures.

42:17.158 --> 42:20.327
It appears this one hails from Sumeria.

42:20.328 --> 42:22.763
Which means that she's connected
to the prophecy somehow?

42:22.764 --> 42:24.598
One that says that we destroy the world.

42:24.599 --> 42:27.167
Though I'm not sure that I buy

42:27.168 --> 42:29.036
some slip of the tongue from Pandora.

42:29.037 --> 42:32.172
CRANE: Well, erroneous message or not,

42:32.173 --> 42:35.942
<i>what's in it for releasing
evil upon Sleepy Hollow?</i>

42:35.943 --> 42:40.180
<i>To test us, raise the level of fear?</i>

42:40.181 --> 42:42.582
<i>But more importantly, Lieutenant,</i>

42:42.583 --> 42:45.552
what if there is some truth to it?

42:45.553 --> 42:49.450
<i>What if we are the destroyers?</i>

42:59.614 --> 43:04.515
