WEBVTT

00:25.400 --> 00:27.652
How you doing, baby?

00:27.736 --> 00:30.030
No, not you.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.033
You. The bow-legged one.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.464
Shoop.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.150
Okay.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.153
Good.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.324
Now, big breath in...

02:00.078 --> 02:01.412
and out.

02:04.833 --> 02:05.750
Nice.

02:06.918 --> 02:11.005
Okay, let's start coming back.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.970
And... we're coming back to ourselves now.

02:20.056 --> 02:20.890
Alex.

02:22.809 --> 02:23.768
How did that go?

02:27.605 --> 02:28.690
Did you get there?

02:31.109 --> 02:34.904
So that's a simple five-minute
meditation you can do

02:34.988 --> 02:37.073
when you're feeling overwhelmed.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.118
Or having a panic attack.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.956
Let your mind take you back
to that memory,

02:45.039 --> 02:47.625
that place where you felt good.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.003
And breathe into it.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.716
Okay.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.052
Who would like to share?

02:59.220 --> 03:00.221
Alex?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.015
I'm Alex.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.518
And...

03:09.022 --> 03:11.774
I'm here because I need therapy.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.947
And what brings you to group today?

03:19.073 --> 03:20.158
I'm just--

03:20.241 --> 03:21.576
I'm trying to...

03:22.410 --> 03:23.828
figure out some stuff...

03:24.579 --> 03:27.916
with my family right now, and...

03:30.126 --> 03:31.961
piece together how I got here.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.340
Where is here?

03:41.262 --> 03:42.764
I don't know. Uh...

03:46.643 --> 03:47.644
Um...

03:48.561 --> 03:50.271
I grew up here. Uh...

03:52.565 --> 03:54.525
So I see myself everywhere.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.319
You know, I, uh...

03:58.071 --> 04:01.532
I worked in that restaurant,
and that bakery.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.246
I went to that high school.
I skateboarded in that parking lot.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.831
Or I tried to.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.459
Now...

04:13.294 --> 04:18.299
Now I am 25 years old, and...

04:19.133 --> 04:22.804
I'm living with my mother and my kid

04:23.680 --> 04:25.974
in an RV, uh...

04:26.933 --> 04:28.559
cleaning toilets full-time.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.314
Pretty sexy stuff.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.901
Um...

04:37.819 --> 04:40.780
I almost left once. I got into college.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.032
I got a scholarship, so...

04:43.116 --> 04:47.954
I went to their orientation weekend
and everything, and, uh...

04:49.163 --> 04:53.209
I got to kayak in their river and...

04:55.378 --> 04:57.255
hike the M.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.090
There's this big M

04:59.173 --> 05:03.261
above the campus in Missoula,
on the side of the mountain.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.643
Yeah. Uh...

05:15.273 --> 05:16.399
I guess I'm just...

05:19.319 --> 05:21.279
I'm not sure what happened to me.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.334
Still 42 on the list.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.544
No movement at all?

05:41.215 --> 05:43.343
Why the fuck does this county
offer Section 8

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
if it's a mythical unicorn
that nobody gets?

05:45.511 --> 05:48.890
Yeah, well, wait-lists
are longer than usual right now.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.809
There's unprecedented homeless numbers.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.312
We need somewhere to live.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.773
We were lucky to get you
into that last apartment.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.150
I'm on seven types
of government assistance

05:59.233 --> 06:02.236
and I'm working the maximum I can
without getting my benefits cut.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.864
But after food and gas and daycare co-pay,

06:04.947 --> 06:07.909
we have a total
of nine dollars extra every week.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.744
That's a box of tampons.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.538
How am I ever supposed to afford rent,
even subsidized rent,

06:12.622 --> 06:14.207
with nine dollars extra every week.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.958
How is this assistance assisting me?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.004
I can't keep living with my mother.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.882
It's opening your heart chakras. Beating.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.426
Mom, please.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.303
It's 4 in the morning.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.306
Uh...

06:31.391 --> 06:33.726
What about Home TBRA?

06:33.810 --> 06:37.271
Yeah. Uh... If we can get you a PJ.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.107
A Participating Jurisdiction.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.733
Okay, how do I do that?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.945
Okay, so we need to find you a landlord

06:44.028 --> 06:47.573
who's willing to accept the TBRA vouchers
to subsidize the portion of the rent

06:47.657 --> 06:49.075
you can't afford.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.786
But they've got to be willing to jump
through hoops.

06:51.869 --> 06:55.498
And since Maddy is under 6,
that makes it even harder.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.292
It needs to be inspected first
to make sure it's up to code,

06:58.376 --> 07:00.628
and no landlord wants to do that.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.507
Plus, it cannot be less than 80%
of the published

07:04.590 --> 07:07.677
Section 8 existing housing
fair-market rent.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.848
We're gonna un-enroll you from Section 8
because you can't be getting Home TBRA

07:11.931 --> 07:14.392
if you're already getting TBRA
with your Section 8.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.311
Oh, my God, what is happening?

07:17.395 --> 07:19.772
It's annoying, that's what I'm saying.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.692
A lot of work for a landlord
when you could just get full rent

07:22.775 --> 07:24.360
from Tom, Dick or Sally.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.990
So Home TBRA is a unicorn too?

07:29.073 --> 07:29.907
No.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.453
Home TBRA is real,
and it's a good program,

07:33.536 --> 07:36.289
you just have to convince a landlord
to participate.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.374
Turn on the charm, Alex.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.267
So, uh...

07:57.727 --> 08:03.107
you guys need first and last,
or is there a little wiggle room?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.987
You know, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.120
You have such kind eyes.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.164
You trying to get me
to take a TBRA voucher?

08:19.123 --> 08:21.959
Can I walk you through
the TBRA guidelines?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.295
It's very flexible.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.548
It's not Monopoly money, ma'am.
It's rent assistance.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.092
I do have a job, I would be paying 70%.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.677
Help a broke bitch out.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.392
Hi, picking up Maddy Boyd.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.354
Drew, can you grab Maddy?

08:41.437 --> 08:42.271
One sec.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.489
Rose!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.287
Coming!

09:00.540 --> 09:03.751
Okay, here-- Here we go.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.171
That's not my kid.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.798
Really, you're sure?

09:08.881 --> 09:11.467
I'm sure, this is Harper,
and I'm here for Maddy Boyd.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.265
Where's Rose?

09:17.348 --> 09:19.892
Oh, she quit. We think, yeah.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.019
Went off for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.148
I'll get the right kid, hang on.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.614
You're kidding me.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.449
They couldn't find her
for 20 minutes,

09:35.533 --> 09:37.159
she was asleep in a toy closet.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.289
I don't know what's worse, losing my kid
or trying to give me somebody else's.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.958
Uh, losing your kid. Definitely.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.960
I'm pretty sure that's a felony.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.757
I'm faster.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.593
No, I'm faster.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.677
You okay?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.763
Yeah, I'm okay. She's okay, so I'm okay.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.685
-She seems okay to you, right?
-Yeah, totally.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.691
I can't ever bring her back
to that shitty daycare ever again.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.986
I'm faster than you.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.779
Well, what about Sean?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.407
Is, uh... Is he any help?

10:17.658 --> 10:19.702
You've met Sean before, haven't you?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.038
Yeah. Yeah, yep.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.290
So...

10:24.915 --> 10:27.543
I guess that's it with you guys?
Case closed?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.756
Case super closed.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.678
Yeah, but it's hard.
When you have a kid...

10:38.429 --> 10:43.017
I mean, Karina and I
kept trying to fix things for Brady.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.811
I fixed things by leaving.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.229
Maddy, wait up.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.693
I could, like,
talk to Brady's pre-school

10:52.777 --> 10:55.988
and just see if they have
an extra spot open for Maddy.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.242
-Oh, that's all right, thank you, though.
-No, honestly. They are great.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.747
They do ceramics with the kids, and...

11:04.830 --> 11:09.919
uh, they grow herbs,
and other pretentious things.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.087
Sounds awesome.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.214
No, that sounds awesome, but I, uh--

11:13.297 --> 11:17.301
I get my government grant
to supplement my daycare payments.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.221
And it's an intense pain in the ass,

11:20.304 --> 11:24.058
so really just the most garbage
daycares want to deal with that.

11:24.141 --> 11:24.975
Yeah.

11:27.103 --> 11:31.023
I'll still talk to the owner of our place,
explain the situation.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.401
She's a sweet old hippie, you know.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.986
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

11:37.154 --> 11:41.575
Look at us. You know, we're finally
on a playdate with our toddlers.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.419
Well, it was getting kind of weird
how many times you asked.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.298
Oh.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.553
-Ready to see your daddy?
-Yes!

12:01.595 --> 12:05.808
We're meeting him at this diner,
which is wildly inconvenient for Mommy.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.854
But Mommy is so accommodating
and flexible, don't you think so, Mad?

12:09.937 --> 12:10.771
Yep.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.150
Hey, how old are you about to be? Sixteen?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.985
No. Three.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.237
-Twenty-two?
-No. Three.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.740
-Nine years old? You're turning 9.
-No!

12:21.323 --> 12:23.033
-Three.
-You're turning 3?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.869
Oh, my God!

12:25.578 --> 12:26.787
There you go.

12:29.081 --> 12:29.915
Maddy!

12:30.541 --> 12:31.542
Hey!

12:32.209 --> 12:33.753
Mad-dog, hi.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.630
-Look who's here.
-How are you, buddy?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
Got a high-five for Grandpa?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.511
I got this. Stay safe.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.100
You look tired, Alexandra.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.270
What are you doing with Sean?

12:52.396 --> 12:54.648
We go to the same meeting.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.152
Sometimes we get pie afterwards.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.739
Sometimes? So this is a regular thing.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.910
Look, he's just going through
a tough time right now.

13:05.993 --> 13:10.664
And the program's all about service,
just lending a hand.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.251
I wish you'd let me help you.

13:14.794 --> 13:19.673
Heard you and Maddy are staying in a van,
with your mom and her sketchy boyfriend.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.634
He's her husband now, actually.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.762
Yeah.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.765
That sounds about right. Bye.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.603
What was my dad saying to you?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.147
Nice to see you too.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.151
I don't like you having pie with my dad.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.531
Well, sometimes we mix it up, you know.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.950
We get Jell-O, pudding.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.619
The occasional breakfast pastry. Hmm?

13:53.541 --> 13:54.458
Will you relax?

13:55.417 --> 13:56.252
All right.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.338
-He was just checking on me.
-Why?

14:01.048 --> 14:04.927
Part of getting sober
is talking about why you drink.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.430
-And that's me?
-No, Alex.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.350
Not everything in my life is about you.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.189
I happen to be figuring out
some stuff with my family right now.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.526
What stuff?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.906
Fucked-up stuff
that I didn't remember until just now.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.450
AA just shakes it all loose.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.288
Tell me.

14:33.122 --> 14:33.956
Okay.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.791
Like, um...

14:38.460 --> 14:41.088
I'd used Narcan on my mom before I was 12.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.341
That my step-dad beat me with a tire iron.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.136
That I dropped out of high school
and got a job

14:47.219 --> 14:49.471
because my brother
was legitimately starving.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.642
That, um... I've been a drunk
since I was nine.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.313
Nine?

14:59.648 --> 15:00.649
I'm being honest.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.361
Wow.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.571
Yeah.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.949
Well, Hank says it's a breakthrough.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.411
My dad is not the authority on reality.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.208
Okay.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.169
Whoa!

15:20.252 --> 15:22.129
Come on, Mad-dog, let's get out of here.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.464
What?

15:23.547 --> 15:25.090
I just shared something with you.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.807
Where am I dropping her tomorrow?

15:34.642 --> 15:35.935
Are you still at your mom's?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.812
Yeah, I'm looking at new places today.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.652
Hey, I'm sorry.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.820
I fucked up in there.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.950
What you're going through
is really tough, and I get it.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.244
I should have said
that you're doing great, because you are.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.996
-You're doing great.
-Thanks.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.710
Must be a small part of you that's,
like, "Fuck you, motherfucker.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.463
For not getting sober sooner."

16:08.092 --> 16:11.470
You're sober now,
and it's really great for Maddy.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.266
Would have been great for us,
though, you know.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.228
Just wish I'd done it sooner.

16:19.853 --> 16:20.896
Me too.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.695
See you Saturday.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.206
Let me ask you a question.
Are you familiar with Home TBRA?

16:39.289 --> 16:40.541
TBRA, can I--?

16:40.624 --> 16:43.377
I'm super nice. Please help me.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.462
Am I poor? Yes. Do I do drugs?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.215
No.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.470
I said pass me a wrench,
not manhandle me.

16:53.554 --> 16:58.267
I can't help it, babe.
You've got your hands underneath my hood.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.811
-I love what's under your hood.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.229
Ah, look who's here.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.524
-Hey, guys.
-Ah, shit.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.692
Yeah.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.527
-Oh, fuck.
-Hey.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.363
-Did you get an apartment?
-Not yet.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.574
But I have some really solid leads.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.910
Leads? Oh, that's great.
You should get back out there.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.830
-Just pound that pavement.
-What's going on with your car?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.373
Fucked if I know.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.752
Ran some errands and it--
The engine just backfired on me.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.921
Yeah, I think the old carbie
is out of whack.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.798
The carbie?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.844
Yeah, the, uh, carburetor.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.347
I think that's the radiator.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.891
Oh, come on, you two.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.809
It's a godsend that the car broke down,

17:40.893 --> 17:46.356
because time spent in town running errands
is time away from my husband,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.901
my smoking-hot husband.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.569
Hey, um...

17:51.153 --> 17:52.571
Uh, uh...

17:53.614 --> 17:58.452
Listen, honey, we've kind of got
something going on here, you know?

17:58.535 --> 18:00.454
I have to dry these for work.

18:01.663 --> 18:04.041
Look, babe, it's honeymoon time.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.168
And every second of these first few weeks

18:06.251 --> 18:09.713
are essential
to a sexually positive marriage.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.508
I've got you and a kid around here.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.969
You know, sometimes I just need
this to be a fuckpad.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.960
-Hi.
-Melody.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.504
-Alex, nice to meet you.
-You too, come on in.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.005
Thanks.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.678
It's a perfect time to tour the place.
The kids are at the farm,

18:57.761 --> 19:00.305
at our sister site,
meeting a new litter of puppies.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.765
You have a sister site?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.225
Well, two, actually.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.311
One at the farm, and one
in residence at the Seattle Aquarium.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.481
And over here, this is our gallery.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.195
Every student has their own space to
display whatever it is they're working on.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.656
This could be Maddy's.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.368
You know, we put their art on display
as a reminder

19:21.451 --> 19:23.787
that their interests
are important in this world.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.039
You know, that she is important.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.292
So, what do you think?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.045
I, um...

19:33.422 --> 19:36.967
I think that Maddy would absolutely
pee herself to come here.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.012
-But I'm--
-Nate told me.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.598
You have a WCCC grant, right?

19:42.681 --> 19:45.225
Well, we accept WCCC on occasion.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.103
Wow, you do?

19:49.062 --> 19:52.983
But it only covers
half of our tuition, unfortunately.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.110
So how much can you cover for a co-pay?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.989
Or we have a needs-based scholarship
that we could explore.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.157
To cover the rest?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.409
You are a resident
of Fisher Island, right?

20:02.492 --> 20:04.411
Oh, uh, no.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.246
Hmm.

20:08.123 --> 20:11.376
Is-- Is it a deal breaker?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.253
Not living in Fisher Island?

20:13.337 --> 20:17.341
Well, you have to have proof of residency
of this township to receive aid, yeah.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.843
Right. Um...

20:20.677 --> 20:23.597
I am actually
in the process of moving, right now.

20:24.264 --> 20:27.768
Could I have a few days
to see if there's any way I could get a...

20:27.851 --> 20:29.269
a rental here?

20:30.020 --> 20:32.522
We can hold her spot for 72 hours.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.087
I love it, Gail.

20:56.004 --> 20:56.838
I'll take it.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.216
Uh, you accept TBRA, right?

21:02.636 --> 21:05.764
Do you know anybody
on Fisher Island that takes TBRA?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.606
That bunk's yours. I call topsies.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.446
Oh, no, it's not welfare,
ma'am, it's TBRA.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.907
Tenant-Based Rental--
Just because I'm poor doesn't--

21:23.991 --> 21:25.242
Can I just--?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.015
Value Maids!

22:27.971 --> 22:28.805
Regina.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.975
Sorry, I didn't think you were here.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.020
You can skip this room this week, thanks.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.646
Okay.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.526
How are you?

22:42.611 --> 22:45.238
I see you decided not to sell the house.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.491
What?

22:47.574 --> 22:50.827
There isn't a "For Sale" sign
in the yard anymore.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.416
No, no, I'm-- I'm getting the house
as part of the, uh...

22:57.959 --> 22:58.960
So I'm staying.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.756
The Realtors took all the nursery--

23:03.382 --> 23:06.426
All the nursery staging back,
so now I have to stage it for real.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.637
Irony.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.516
Well, looks like it's gonna be
a beautiful crib.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.143
It was
supposed to arrive assembled,

23:15.227 --> 23:18.605
but I missed the stupid delivery
concierge people by five minutes,

23:18.688 --> 23:21.691
so they left it on my steps,
like a goddamned pizza.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.570
-Can I help you?
-No.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.411
I think you might be using
a screw as a nail.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.453
I said no.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.290
Thank you.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.042
Yeah, no, I'll get back to cleaning.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.883
-Fuck! What the fuck!

23:46.967 --> 23:48.635
This is so stupid!

23:48.718 --> 23:51.221
You stupid fucking piece of shit!

23:52.597 --> 23:57.018
Fuck you!
You fucking ballsack, motherfucker!

23:57.102 --> 24:00.021
What the--? What the--?
What does this even say?

24:00.105 --> 24:03.859
The whole thing is written
in goddamned Swedish Chef!

24:03.942 --> 24:08.530
Am I supposed to climb
into the crib to adjust the spokes?

24:08.613 --> 24:09.781
Damn it!

24:12.284 --> 24:13.785
I think you need a drill.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.788
I think the concierge guys
need to come back.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.458
I can do this in five minutes
if I have a screw gun.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.667
Do you have a screw gun?

24:24.171 --> 24:26.381
Did what's-his-face have a man cave?

24:37.058 --> 24:38.560
Took most of the tools.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.145
Tool.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.023
Got this, though.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.112
Rosie the Riveter over there.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.865
Can I ask you something?

24:52.449 --> 24:53.283
Of course.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.452
What the hell is this?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.039
I got it at my baby shower at the firm.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.000
What is it? Like a tiny hat?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.211
-Uh...

25:04.294 --> 25:07.422
I think-- I think that's a pee-pee teepee.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.343
It goes on the little boy's
pee-pee while you change him

25:11.426 --> 25:13.720
so that he doesn't spray pee on you.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.724
-My son is gonna piss on me?
-Yes.

25:19.601 --> 25:20.685
And so much worse.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.193
When did you transition your daughter
to her crib?

25:28.276 --> 25:29.194
Nine months?

25:30.153 --> 25:32.364
Uh, no. She's always slept with me.

25:32.447 --> 25:36.201
Interesting. So you did
the co-sleeping method.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.663
Did you do a side sleeper
or a swivel bassinet?

25:47.504 --> 25:49.339
Swivel, I think.

25:49.422 --> 25:50.298
Yeah.

25:51.091 --> 25:51.925
Yeah.

25:52.676 --> 25:58.056
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about the sleeping-method stuff yet.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.978
The firm says I can take
all my unused vacation days,

26:03.061 --> 26:04.938
but even with that it's only...

26:05.438 --> 26:07.774
I don't know, we have 16 weeks.

26:08.358 --> 26:12.028
My friends say I'm gonna have to get
a live-in nanny, but I don't know.

26:12.696 --> 26:13.530
I don't know.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.533
You're hiring a live-in nanny?

26:16.616 --> 26:17.993
Yeah. Why?

26:18.076 --> 26:22.038
You know someone
who might be interested in a nanny gig?

26:22.122 --> 26:24.541
Yes, me. I'd be very interested.

26:24.624 --> 26:25.667
You?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.254
Absolutely, yes. I'm great with babies.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.173
Have you nannied professionally?

26:32.257 --> 26:33.758
Regina, I'm a mom.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.719
It's all I do.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.347
I would do it for free
if I could just live here,

26:39.431 --> 26:43.310
because Maddy got into
Island Friends for preschool.

26:43.393 --> 26:47.272
But I have to live in Fisher Island
in order to qualify for financial aid,

26:47.355 --> 26:49.482
and so it would be a win-win
for both of us.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.610
I see.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.322
But I'm just throwing that out there.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.157
It's a good idea.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.075
It's a good idea, but, um--

26:59.159 --> 27:02.954
Yeah, I am down the road
with an au pair service,

27:03.038 --> 27:05.373
and I already made a deposit, so...

27:05.457 --> 27:06.666
sorry.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.584
No sweat.

27:08.418 --> 27:12.130
I'll keep an ear out, though,
and if I can help, I will.

27:13.131 --> 27:13.965
Thanks.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.139
If you really wanted to help,

27:21.640 --> 27:24.726
you could let me
use your address on the form?

27:26.728 --> 27:29.606
That's mail fraud, are you asking me
to commit mail fraud?

27:29.689 --> 27:33.151
No, I wouldn't even mail it in,
I would just hand it to Melody.

27:33.234 --> 27:36.363
I think the address on the form
is a technicality.

27:36.446 --> 27:40.283
Not a technicality.
I could be disbarred for mail fraud.

27:42.160 --> 27:42.994
Sorry.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.582
Why don't you go back to cleaning now?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.126
And I'll finish this.

28:05.266 --> 28:06.768
Big breath in.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.495
And out.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.818
-Filter's gross. I need to switch it out.
-You know where they are.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.779
You coming from Campbell or Tennet?

29:00.321 --> 29:02.615
Campbell. I did Tennet this morning.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.785
-They leave a check for me?
-No. They said they'd Venmo you.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.954
I hate Venmo.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.956
People forget to do it.

29:10.540 --> 29:14.335
Then I've got to invoice and follow up,
it's a whole fucking thing.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.550
Did Regina whip your ass today?

29:22.427 --> 29:23.261
A little.

29:24.179 --> 29:27.265
You're the longest
she's ever kept one of my maids on,

29:27.348 --> 29:29.225
so you must be doing something right.

29:29.309 --> 29:32.437
Wouldn't know it.
The woman gives me fucking whiplash.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.356
Sometimes I'm her friend,
sometimes I'm dog shit.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.734
No, you're always dog shit.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.611
Thanks, Yolanda.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.405
You're never friends with a client.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.202
She told me her whole life's story
on Thanksgiving.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.620
She weren't talking to you.

29:49.245 --> 29:52.165
Even if a client's looking at you,
saying words to your face,

29:52.248 --> 29:53.958
they're still talking to themselves.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.585
You don't exist.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.544
I do, though.

29:57.712 --> 30:01.633
If you dropped dead and I sent
another girl, she wouldn't even notice.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.471
Hey, don't take this personal, honey.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.933
I've been cleaning
some of these houses for ten years,

30:10.016 --> 30:13.061
and I still get called Selena, Gordita
or whatever, I don't care.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.231
I'm just a burrito they call
when their bathroom starts smelling bad.

30:16.898 --> 30:20.568
Are you fucking kidding me?
There's only three ravioli in here.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
Sorry about all the leaves.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.868
I didn't get a chance
to winterize the garden.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.163
You know, you are our very first viewing.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.749
I don't think our post
was up five minutes.

30:35.250 --> 30:39.254
Well, you know what they say,
early bird gets the studio.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.343
I'm really eager to relocate to this area

30:45.426 --> 30:47.470
because my daughter
got into Island Friends.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.265
Oh, that's fabulous. Our son went there.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.183
How old's your son?

30:53.476 --> 30:56.145
He's 22, just moved to Brooklyn.

30:56.229 --> 31:00.024
My wife travels for work,
so it's just me and my computer.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.278
-I'm a web curator. Come on in.
-Nice.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.698
Don't worry about your shoes.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.493
I'll just get the lights.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.539
Yeah.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.499
Go ahead.

31:21.671 --> 31:25.300
So it would just be you
and your daughter? No pets, right?

31:25.383 --> 31:27.093
Yeah, no, just the two of us.

31:27.176 --> 31:30.054
I recently became a single mom, so...

31:30.555 --> 31:33.266
Heroes, every single one of you.

31:33.349 --> 31:36.978
That furniture we could take it out,
or I could leave it in, whatever you want.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.608
Either way, this is, uh...

31:42.942 --> 31:45.111
It's perfect, Vivian.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.696
Yeah, I'll take it.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.031
Great.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.575
You accept TBRA vouchers, right?

31:52.577 --> 31:55.246
Oh, you poor thing.

31:56.539 --> 32:00.209
-You have to navigate that program.
-You know about TBRA?

32:01.044 --> 32:04.923
Yeah, I do some volunteer work
at a homeless shelter downtown,

32:05.006 --> 32:08.426
and I have heard how broken the system is.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.219
Yeah, yeah.

32:11.054 --> 32:16.351
It's like having a full-time job
on top of my actual full-time job.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.353
Oh, honey, I can't even imagine.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.106
But I can't take TBRA vouchers.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.692
We're not zoned
for an apartment back here,

32:24.776 --> 32:28.488
so we actually have to
keep this... under the table.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.615
Don't tell Uncle Sam.

32:31.491 --> 32:37.914
I can knock... maybe 100
off the security deposit?

32:40.667 --> 32:41.584
Um...

32:43.252 --> 32:44.671
What about a barter?

32:45.755 --> 32:48.424
I could clean for half and pay half.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.718
I'm a professional maid.

32:52.303 --> 32:56.641
You know, we already have Marta,
and she is like family to us.

32:57.892 --> 33:00.061
So, yeah.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.939
I heard you say that you're behind
in winterizing your garden,

33:03.022 --> 33:06.317
and I'm also an experienced landscaper.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.784
I really want my daughter to live here.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.452
Please?

33:17.704 --> 33:20.957
I can make your yard
look like Versailles by spring.

33:21.040 --> 33:21.916
You just wait.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.502
Well, I do hate yard work.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.254
Deal.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.539
Wait. Don't forget the wishing well.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.250
Uh, no. Maddy already cut
herself twice on that.

34:46.334 --> 34:47.752
This isn't about you.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.213
This is between me and my granddaughter.

34:50.296 --> 34:53.382
We made this piece of art together,
and she named it the wishing well

34:53.466 --> 34:56.010
and made a wish on it
that only me and the fairies know

34:56.094 --> 34:58.888
because she's a genius
little love-child person.

34:58.971 --> 35:01.682
I want you to put it underneath her bed,

35:02.225 --> 35:06.312
so when she calls out for me,
I want you to tell her that I am here,

35:06.395 --> 35:08.606
that I am in nature.

35:08.689 --> 35:12.485
In our ancestry, in the ferocious
lineage of warrior women

35:12.568 --> 35:15.196
that have banged
on the drum of life as a collective.

35:15.988 --> 35:16.823
Okay.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.908
She's going to miss me so much.

35:18.991 --> 35:21.702
She's going to be okay.
I'll see you Saturday.

35:22.328 --> 35:23.329
What's Saturday?

35:23.955 --> 35:24.997
Maddy's birthday?

35:25.498 --> 35:27.375
Oh, right.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.545
I'm going to paint the shit out
of those kids' faces.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.462
Great.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.759
Hey, Basil!

35:37.718 --> 35:38.970
Thanks for having us.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.806
He's just napping.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.851
No, he's not.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.689
Did you ask him
why there's a "For Rent" sign

35:49.772 --> 35:51.732
in your yard
and his phone number is on it?

35:51.816 --> 35:54.944
I did. He said you made it up.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.489
I sure didn't. I have a photo.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.412
Look, do me a favor, honey.

36:04.495 --> 36:08.457
Next time, take a picture of the leaves
or a chicken pot pie.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.792
Anything else.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.588
But congratulations on your new pad, babe.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.548
You willed that into existence

36:15.631 --> 36:18.759
by harnessing your feral
warfare ancestry blood.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.846
Yeah, that's right, baby.

36:21.929 --> 36:25.099
I'm so proud of you.
You're going to love that place.

36:26.184 --> 36:30.021
-I'm going to look for pine cones.
-You're looking for pine cones.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.942
-One.
-Thank you for your help, my little Mad.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.070
Two. And...

36:38.696 --> 36:39.530
Yes!

36:41.490 --> 36:42.825
I can still carry.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.205
-Ten.
-What?

36:47.747 --> 36:48.998
Good job, girl.

36:50.291 --> 36:54.212
Hey, Maddy. Come here.
Be super nice to this lady, okay?

36:54.295 --> 36:56.005
-Hi!
-Sasha's back.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.465
-She's back.
-Alex.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.634
I'm Alex. It's so nice to meet you.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.219
-Hi.
-And this is Maddy.

37:01.886 --> 37:02.720
Hi, Maddy.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.974
I feel like I already know you,
because you and Viv were such fast friends

37:07.058 --> 37:08.809
before I even knew we had a renter.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.355
Yeah. Thank you so much
for making this arrangement with us.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.898
We really love it here.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.775
Look at these rhododendrons.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.945
These bushes have never looked so good.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.988
They just needed a good trim.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.282
-Don't do it.
-Do what?

37:23.366 --> 37:26.035
Don't make the bush trimming joke.

37:26.118 --> 37:28.287
-I wasn't going to.
-Yes, you were.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.332
Did you guys want
a fun pattern or something?

37:31.415 --> 37:35.253
I could work on making that
into a lightning bolt if you'd prefer.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.506
So you don't have to make the joke,
because I did.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.343
See what I mean now? She's great.

37:42.426 --> 37:43.386
-Totally.
-Right?

37:44.553 --> 37:45.638
Hey, Maddy.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.267
Maddy. How old are you, Maddy?

37:51.185 --> 37:53.187
I think we've got a 2 under there.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.274
-A 2 that's about to be 3 on Saturday.
-Three?

37:57.191 --> 38:00.111
No. You having a party?

38:01.070 --> 38:03.781
We're doing a family
get-together at the park.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.243
You don't want to do it here?
Under the gazebo?

38:07.326 --> 38:08.536
We love the park.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.789
It's no problem at all.
We'd love to have it.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.041
You can get the bonfire going
when it gets cold.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.459
We got the best view in town.

38:15.543 --> 38:19.463
You guys are being super generous already,
so I don't want to take advantage of this.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.632
-Alex, we do nothing here.
-Nothing.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.468
Please, make use of the space.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.346
Right? You're absolving us
of our guilt, anyway.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.224
If you're certain,

38:30.308 --> 38:32.059
I mean, that'd be amazing.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.562
But it's going to be ten people.
Is that too many?

38:34.645 --> 38:36.022
-Great, perfect.
-That's fine.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.464
-You wanna blow some balloons?
-Yes.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.969
Hey! Happy birthday, Maddy!

39:07.053 --> 39:08.387
Hey, guys!

39:09.472 --> 39:11.640
-How's it going?
-Good.

39:11.724 --> 39:15.227
Brady, you remember Maddy
and Maddy's mommy, right?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.521
Hi, honey. What do you have here?

39:18.731 --> 39:20.691
-Dinosaur.
-What kind of dinosaur?

39:20.775 --> 39:21.984
-Velociraptor.
-What?

39:22.068 --> 39:24.278
-Velociraptor.
-That's a velociraptor?

39:24.779 --> 39:25.696
That's amazing.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.281
Hey, Maddy.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.326
Happy birthday. Look what I got for you.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.538
-Can you say thank you?
-Full of popcorn, can't say thank you.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.792
The thing about this present
is we've got to open it soon because...

39:37.875 --> 39:39.919
-Whoa, whoa!
-What's in there?

39:41.087 --> 39:44.256
It's-- My dad used to always... do that.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.466
It's not an animal.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.885
-It's not?
-It's not. It's, um...

39:50.763 --> 39:54.058
mermaid bath toys.
I hope she doesn't have them.

39:54.141 --> 39:55.851
-She does not.
-Good.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.520
Great. Well, then, here.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.188
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.314
She'll love that.

40:00.815 --> 40:04.068
And this one, remember, Brady?

40:04.151 --> 40:06.153
-Remember we got these...
-Hats!

40:06.237 --> 40:08.781
Mermaid birthday hats!

40:10.366 --> 40:11.951
-Should I put one on Mommy?
-Yes.

40:12.034 --> 40:14.412
-Yes, please.
-Okay, here we go.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.747
-Here.
-Thank you.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.501
-Thank you very much.
-Hold on one second. All right.

40:21.627 --> 40:22.878
And how about me?

40:23.921 --> 40:26.465
-That is a good look. There you go.
-Good for you? Yeah?

40:26.549 --> 40:29.677
-Really good. Super strong look.
-With the beard? Well...

40:29.760 --> 40:31.220
-Stop it, please.
-Yeah.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.684
Uh, Maddy, do you want to play
Brady's favorite game?

40:37.393 --> 40:40.729
It's Dinosaur, where you guys chase me
because you're dinosaurs.

40:40.813 --> 40:41.647
Yes!

40:41.730 --> 40:43.357
Let's go! Come on!

40:43.441 --> 40:44.275
Get him!

40:46.152 --> 40:47.695
Where am I going? Hey!

40:47.778 --> 40:49.905
Where do I--? I don't know where to go!

40:49.989 --> 40:52.032
Which way is it? Is it this way? Yeah.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.702
-No!

40:56.287 --> 40:57.455
I can't get away!

41:00.291 --> 41:03.961
Are you kidding me?
I'm sitting at a table, waiting for Sean.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.674
Go, Brady.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.634
Yeah. Cool.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.803
That's so cool.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.684
Can I get you some more juice?

41:26.358 --> 41:28.527
Drink your juice and be quiet.

41:30.863 --> 41:31.989
Juice?

41:32.072 --> 41:33.491
Where the fuck is Sean?

41:34.492 --> 41:36.911
Uh, I don't know, I said00.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.121
-So00 at the earliest.
-Thanks.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.831
Can you scratch my neck, please?

41:41.999 --> 41:43.167
Right there.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.545
What's been going on with you guys?
It's been forever.

41:46.629 --> 41:48.964
-Not much, just chilling.
-And?

41:49.882 --> 41:51.634
We got engaged, dick.

41:51.717 --> 41:52.843
That too.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.971
What? Congratulations, that's--
How did I miss that?

41:56.055 --> 41:58.182
We didn't post it on social media.

41:58.265 --> 42:01.644
I think it's tacky, the whole ring shot.

42:01.727 --> 42:03.395
I'll do it live, for sure.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.148
-Very pretty.
-Yeah.

42:06.232 --> 42:08.067
He did a good job.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.194
It hurt too.
I'm gonna be paying that off for years.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.863
Aww. But it was worth it.

42:14.323 --> 42:15.324
There he is.

42:15.407 --> 42:17.076
Hey, birthday girl.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.537
-Happy birthday.
-Hi.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.496
Whoa!

42:22.540 --> 42:23.916
That's the girl from The Swan?

42:25.209 --> 42:26.418
Frankie? Yeah.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.586
She's a server.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.718
Sean brought a date to Maddy's birthday?

42:36.345 --> 42:37.638
I don't know, Alex.

42:38.472 --> 42:41.684
I gotta stay out of whatever this is
with you and Sean.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.688
You know what this is with me and Sean.

42:46.313 --> 42:49.024
You told me your version, okay,
and he has his.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.943
I'm Switzerland.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.865
No, you're not.
I see you guys hanging out all the time.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.409
-You post it on Instagram.
-Yeah.

42:58.492 --> 43:02.079
Sean's been Ethan's best friend
since second grade, Alex.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.373
-Okay.
-I don't...

43:07.585 --> 43:09.962
-Hi, how are you?
-Who's behind there? It's Maddy.

43:10.045 --> 43:11.547
You look amazing.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.181
Hey!

43:21.807 --> 43:23.142
-Hey.
-You okay?

43:23.225 --> 43:27.438
Yeah, no. I was just texting my mom.
I don't know where the fuck she is.

43:27.521 --> 43:30.107
No, don't worry about it.
We're having a lot of fun, so...

43:30.190 --> 43:31.150
Thank you.

43:31.233 --> 43:35.738
I was really counting on an hour
of face-painting entertainment, but...

43:35.821 --> 43:37.698
Don't worry about it. They're, uh--

43:38.157 --> 43:39.783
They're plenty entertained.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.410
-So come join us.
-Thanks to you.

43:41.493 --> 43:42.745
Well, whatever.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.371
I'll clean this up a bit.

43:44.997 --> 43:48.250
-Who's making more bubbles than me?
-I got more bubbles.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.961
You got more bubbles?
Look, there's more juice over there.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.840
-Is he your new boyfriend?
-No.

43:54.923 --> 43:57.843
I would never bring a date
to my child's birthday.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.056
I know him. Right?

44:02.139 --> 44:05.267
He's that herb that used to
bus tables at The Neptune.

44:06.101 --> 44:09.271
All right. He is an engineer now,
and he's my friend.

44:09.355 --> 44:10.606
He's not your friend.

44:11.607 --> 44:12.650
Yes, he is.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.986
He wanted to fuck you then and now.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.198
Look at you blush.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.451
You have no right to bring
your 9-year-old girlfriend

44:22.534 --> 44:24.745
-without talking to me about it first.
-She's 20.

44:26.038 --> 44:28.082
It's important who our daughter is around,

44:28.165 --> 44:31.377
and these are the things I expect
to have conversations with you about.

44:31.460 --> 44:35.339
-I don't remember you asking me about him.
-He's not my boyfriend.

44:36.674 --> 44:37.883
-Hey, Mom.
-He wants to be.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.259
I know, I'm late.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.261
I missed the ferry.

44:41.345 --> 44:44.932
But Grammy's here now
for the birthday girl.

44:45.015 --> 44:48.477
Oh, my God,
can you believe she's 3, Sean-y?

44:48.560 --> 44:50.896
Oh, shit, man, you're just adorable.

44:51.397 --> 44:53.107
-Hey, Paula, come here.
-Look at this.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.609
-You got some pomade going on.
-Yeah.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.319
Whoo!

44:57.403 --> 45:00.322
Okay. Where's the wine?

45:00.406 --> 45:01.657
I need some wine.

45:02.282 --> 45:03.617
Did you bring the face paint?

45:04.368 --> 45:08.247
Can I just have a minute
to catch my breath before I clock in?

45:08.330 --> 45:10.874
There's only 20 minutes left,
and it was your idea.

45:10.958 --> 45:14.712
I'm sorry. Basil and I got in a fight,
and he took off.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.005
What do you mean, Basil took off?

45:17.089 --> 45:21.218
Honey, don't you have any wine?
What kind of a party doesn't have wine?

45:21.301 --> 45:24.972
A child's birthday in the afternoon,
thrown by food stamps.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.726
-So, what happened?
-I don't know.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.227
Whatever happened is your fault

45:30.310 --> 45:33.522
because you planted those ideas
in my head about him renting my house.

45:33.605 --> 45:36.567
He said he couldn't even look at me

45:36.650 --> 45:39.194
if I thought he was capable
of doing something like that.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.696
Then, my God, he just--

45:41.196 --> 45:46.618
He shoved me out of the RV
and drove off the lot with all my stuff.

45:47.786 --> 45:49.204
That RV is your home.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.249
So you're homeless now?

45:52.332 --> 45:55.419
No, no, he's just blowing off some steam.

45:55.502 --> 45:57.171
He'll be back in a few days.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.673
Oh, God.

45:59.757 --> 46:00.966
-Sean-y, baby.
-Yeah?

46:01.049 --> 46:02.176
I need booze.

46:02.718 --> 46:03.761
He's sober, Mom.

46:03.844 --> 46:06.221
Well, he's a bartender.

46:06.305 --> 46:09.099
He still knows
how to get someone booze, right?

46:09.183 --> 46:12.269
Why don't I invite my girls over?
They can bring us whatever we want.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.812
-No. Don't do that.
-Good idea.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.732
-Yeah, Chardonnay. Chardonnay.
-I'm on it.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.026
Wow.

46:19.985 --> 46:20.944
She's pretty.

46:51.558 --> 46:54.102
Not that. That one's white. Look at this.

46:55.437 --> 46:59.066
Hey, Alex, what's the address here?
My weed guy's coming over.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.734
Oh, hey, hey, no, no, no.

47:01.568 --> 47:04.613
No, you can't have your weed guy
come to my child's birthday.

47:04.696 --> 47:07.533
-We should probably head out, anyway.
-Yep. That's a good call.

47:07.616 --> 47:08.951
Don't be such a grandpa.

47:09.034 --> 47:12.746
Alex, what do you think the chances are
we can get these kids' faces painted?

47:12.830 --> 47:13.914
Face paint!

47:14.414 --> 47:16.625
Hey, Mom, what do you say
about some face paint?

47:16.708 --> 47:21.964
-But let's all be more quiet about this.
-All right, just line up one at a time.

47:22.047 --> 47:24.258
Here we go. Salut!

47:25.634 --> 47:27.845
Shh. Can we do some inside voices?

47:42.776 --> 47:44.528
Happy birthday.

47:44.611 --> 47:46.029
Did you think of your wish?

47:47.239 --> 47:48.282
All right.

47:48.991 --> 47:49.825
Ready?

47:50.701 --> 47:53.453
One, two, three.

47:54.621 --> 47:58.792
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Happy birthday!

47:59.626 --> 48:00.836
Okay, Maddy.

48:02.588 --> 48:04.965
You could have blown out
ten candles with that one.

48:05.048 --> 48:06.884
Happy birthday, baby girl.

48:15.976 --> 48:19.396
-Can I help you with this cleanup?
-I got it. I got it.

48:19.479 --> 48:20.647
-Thank you, though.
-Okay.

48:20.731 --> 48:24.860
I've got Brady konked out in
the car seat and I've got to get him home,

48:24.943 --> 48:27.404
but this was a great party.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.156
Was it?

48:29.239 --> 48:31.742
No, it was. It absolutely was.

48:31.825 --> 48:34.244
And thank you for inviting us.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.288
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah. And, uh...

48:38.582 --> 48:42.920
I was wondering if I could call you
tomorrow, if that's not like too...?

48:44.421 --> 48:46.381
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay.

48:47.799 --> 48:49.384
Okay. Thanks for coming.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.303
Cool. Then I'll take off, yeah.

48:51.929 --> 48:55.140
Happy birthday, Maddy.
Nice to see you both. Take care.

48:55.724 --> 48:56.725
Oh, okay.

49:02.356 --> 49:05.192
Okay, everybody, party's over.

49:05.275 --> 49:08.362
-What? No.
-No. Come on!

49:08.445 --> 49:11.406
The party's very over.
You all need to go home now.

49:12.449 --> 49:15.786
It's okay. Sean will build us
a real fire on the beach, won't he?

49:16.536 --> 49:18.372
-Happy birthday, Mad-dog.
-Let's go.

49:18.455 --> 49:22.292
I'm going to head on in.
I've got to put the birthday girl to bed.

49:22.376 --> 49:25.712
Hey. You girls are gonna change the world.

49:25.796 --> 49:29.383
-Take what's yours. Time's up, okay?
-Whoo!

49:29.466 --> 49:30.384
Whoo!

49:33.595 --> 49:36.431
Guys, I know a great spot down here.

49:43.188 --> 49:44.773
Come on, Sean!

50:11.758 --> 50:12.634
Mommy.

50:13.802 --> 50:14.928
Yes, sweetheart?

50:15.429 --> 50:17.556
It was the best day ever.

50:28.066 --> 50:29.192
Alex!

50:49.671 --> 50:52.174
-Hey. Sean.
-Hmm?

50:52.758 --> 50:53.675
-Get up.
-What?

50:54.259 --> 50:55.469
-What? What?
-Get up.

50:55.552 --> 50:58.555
-You're in my landlords' house. Get up.
-Alex. Hey.

50:59.097 --> 51:01.767
-Get up. Put your clothes on.
-What? Who are they?

51:01.850 --> 51:04.144
My landlords. Put your fucking pants on.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.022
Oh, shit. Okay.

51:07.105 --> 51:10.901
I'll pay for everything.
I'll take care of this. I will replace--

51:10.984 --> 51:14.488
I will replace your vase, I promise you.
I'm so sorry. I will clean this up.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.573
-Frankie...
-No. Put your pants on.

51:16.656 --> 51:18.158
...she left me on the beach.

51:18.241 --> 51:20.619
I don't give a shit about Frankie.
Put your pants on.

51:20.702 --> 51:23.830
-She was pissed I wouldn't fuck her.
-I don't care. Put your pants on.

51:23.914 --> 51:28.335
-No. Put your pants on. Not the time.
-She kept putting her hand down my pants.

51:28.418 --> 51:29.544
Outside!

51:29.628 --> 51:31.546
She kept saying, "What's wrong?"

51:32.172 --> 51:34.424
She kept asking me, "What's wrong?"

51:34.508 --> 51:36.593
-What's wrong?
-Don't touch me. Get off of me.

51:36.676 --> 51:40.388
-What's wrong with my dick... is you.
-Shut up and go outside!

51:40.472 --> 51:42.099
-It's--
-Fucking go outside!

51:58.615 --> 52:02.786
I have nothing to say
other than I'm really sorry.

52:02.869 --> 52:03.703
I--

52:04.496 --> 52:08.250
Um, I promise you
that I'll pay for all that.

52:08.333 --> 52:12.087
I'm going to replace your vase,
and I will clean that up.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.089
Um...

52:15.257 --> 52:19.344
Thank you for letting me stay here,
and thank you for letting me-- I--

52:20.720 --> 52:23.640
Please don't kick me out.
I promise this won't ever happen again.

53:48.683 --> 53:49.976
Best behavior, okay?

53:51.519 --> 53:54.272
-Hey. Look at this crew.
-Hi.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.149
I love it, please, come in.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.318
Don't mind if I do.

54:03.156 --> 54:05.408
Uh-- I'll go get your stuff.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.827
-Oh, I'll get it, don't worry about it.
-No, allow me.
