00:02.303 --> 00:04.038
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:04.072 --> 00:05.439
Tell him I might know
who killed Mia Tanner.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.308
You should've just kept your
mouth shut about that girl.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.644
TANNER:
Carlos was bleeding internally.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.413
They had to move him to county.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.514
The last time

00:13.547 --> 00:15.449
we saw each other,

00:15.483 --> 00:18.252
I was accusing your son of
the worst possible crime.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.454
I'm not sure
what to think anymore.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.291
If he didn't kill Mia and
he dies because of this...

00:23.324 --> 00:26.127
All we can hope is that we get
a chance to make this right.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.031
*

00:36.204 --> 00:38.172
What
Did Ochoa... Is-is he...

00:38.206 --> 00:39.440
No, no.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.041
For once, it's good news.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.145
Come on.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.446
DOCTOR:
He'd lost a lot of blood

00:45.479 --> 00:47.148
by the time he got here.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.550
The prison hospital
didn't do him any favors.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.652
They missed the secondary
internal injury.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.654
You can speak
to him briefly.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.489
Then he needs to rest.
Understand?

00:55.523 --> 00:56.657
Yes.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.327
Of course, Doctor.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.561
Thank you.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.300
Carlos. Carlos.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.068
Hey.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.107
Hey, your attorney said that
you were trying to call me.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.642
Tanner, give him
a second.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.180
You-you had something to tell
me before you were stabbed.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.881
You remembered something
about Mia?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.217
"Sports shop."

01:24.618 --> 01:28.156
I remembered what it meant.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.490
Who it meant.

01:32.193 --> 01:36.597
The night I called,
I had a dream about Mia.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.600
I took her out on her birthday.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.702
She saw a dude she knew.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.338
I came out
of the bathroom, and...

01:44.372 --> 01:46.907
and she was over,
talking to him.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.211
She said
he was just an old friend.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.646
She called him something.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.748
It wasn't "sports shop."

01:54.782 --> 01:57.218
No, but it was close.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.453
Okay.
Uh, she said it was a nickname.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.191
It meant, uh,

02:03.224 --> 02:05.593
"black sheep"
in another language.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.662
Maybe German?

02:08.696 --> 02:10.664
She say where she knew him from?

02:10.698 --> 02:13.501
She hadn't seen him in a while.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.772
Maybe Prague?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.641
Does that make any sense?
Yes.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.476
She was backpacking through
Europe a few years ago.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.178
Yes.
Okay, Carlos,

02:24.212 --> 02:25.546
can you give me a description?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.648
What, tall, short?

02:27.681 --> 02:29.517
Weight? Anything.

02:29.550 --> 02:33.254
I don't know.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.423
I didn't really get
a good look at him.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.763
Pretty tall, I think.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.301
She took a selfie with him.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.702
What?

02:48.736 --> 02:51.439
She took a selfie.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.208
It doesn't matter
if I know what he looked like.

02:54.242 --> 02:57.345
There's a picture of him
in her phone.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.517
Thank you.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.553
*

03:13.994 --> 03:16.597
We find the picture
and we put it up on Sophe.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.333
One step at a time, Tanner.
This is more than just a step.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.369
This is like a Michael Jordan
half-court leap...

03:21.402 --> 03:23.504
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
...ripping the rim down.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.240
It's all good, it's all good.
But even if we find the guy,

03:26.274 --> 03:27.541
we still got to link
him to the murder.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.244
Let me ask you something.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.679
How did you know?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.647
How'd I know what?

03:33.681 --> 03:36.284
How did you know that
Carlos Ochoa did not kill Mia?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.785
I'm not doing this
right now.
No, listen.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
You-you put your
ass on the line.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.854
You kneecapped
your career for it.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.357
Do you need
another black eye?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.726
Look, I'm just saying,
you did all that.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.760
Why?

03:46.794 --> 03:49.430
Just a feeling.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.831
Come on.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.866
A detective with
your experience? No way.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.303
There was something you saw.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.605
I don't know.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.040
Something... something felt off.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.343
Just...

04:02.376 --> 04:04.745
I've interrogated
hundreds of killers.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.448
He just wasn't one.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.618
But damned
if I can tell you why.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.454
But there's one key difference
between then and now.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.289
Sophe?

04:15.323 --> 04:16.857
Sophe hasn't solved it.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.760
Not yet. But we didn't have
Black Sheep until now.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.762
This is it.
I'm telling you.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.298
We're gonna get the son
of a bitch who did this

04:24.332 --> 04:25.566
and get Ochoa out.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.401
Look, Tanner,
you make it sound easy.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.902
The power of positive thinking.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.504
Well, I think you're
positively full of...

04:30.538 --> 04:31.472
SARA:
Dutch.

04:32.340 --> 04:32.840
TANNER: What?
According to the crowd,

04:33.874 --> 04:34.675
"Zwart Schaap" is
Dutch, not German.

04:35.443 --> 04:35.843
'Cause that's
not weirder at all.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.579
Nice work. See?

04:38.612 --> 04:39.347
SARA:
Did Carlos say anything else?

04:40.381 --> 04:41.349
Yes, he said
there's a picture on...

04:42.383 --> 04:42.816
Hey, hey. We're following
up on another lead.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.585
We'll let you know
if it pans out.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.756
Under-promise, over-deliver.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.492
Remember that.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.293
So...

04:54.462 --> 04:55.896
How's that going?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.565
How's what going?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.467
Since you and
Tanner. You know.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.470
I'm fine. It's fine.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.804
We are fine.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.406
You're just saying
"fine" a lot

05:05.439 --> 05:06.774
for someone who's
actually fine.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.777
Let's just concentrate
on the posts, shall we?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.680
Let's see what other connections
this drags up.

05:12.713 --> 05:13.847
BOTH:
Fine.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.785
TANNER: Dutch. Opens up
a lot of avenues,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.420
especially if it's
a family nickname.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.689
If you say so.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.891
What's going on?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.894
Nothing, man. It's...

05:26.927 --> 05:29.430
It's just, I've seen
you excited before.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.698
All right? Look.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.533
We need to take this
one step at a time.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.403
First, let's find the picture
Ochoa was talking about,

05:35.436 --> 05:37.438
and then we'll get all...

05:37.471 --> 05:39.673
Hey.
Hey.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.543
You believe him?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.645
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.600
WOMAN: I need you to confirm
this is your daughter.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.935
Do we have to?

06:07.968 --> 06:08.969
I'm afraid so.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.741
Are you ready?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.944
Yeah. Yeah.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.889
Mia. Oh... No.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.926
CAVANAUGH:
Tanner.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.895
Tanner.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.465
Are you all right?
Yeah.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.832
You good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.802
Um, June 9th is her birthday.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.403
June 9th.
Yeah.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.789
Did I miss it?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.624
Is it not there?
Hold on a second.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.862
Okay, 134, 135, 136, 138...

07:08.896 --> 07:10.731
Image 137 is missing.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.234
Photo's gone.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.905
Whoever this is
killed Mia

07:17.938 --> 07:19.873
and erased himself
from her phone.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.519
Best I can tell,
about a dozen pictures

07:31.552 --> 07:32.620
were erased from the phone.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.854
And way more
from the laptop.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.756
Most from the month
she spent in Europe.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.525
TARIQ: He even deleted
the backend logs.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.627
SARA: He must have gone through
half a dozen levels of security.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.595
He knew what he was doing.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.230
Can't you just grab the
pictures from the cloud?

07:43.263 --> 07:45.265
Mia didn't back up anything
personal on the cloud.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.134
I taught her that. I didn't want
paparazzi to get ahold of it.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.136
Wait a minute, didn't you
help create the cloud?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.704
I'm a walking contradiction.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.140
Can you guys just please
try to find that picture?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.509
We can try.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.645
Tanner, let me talk
to you for a second.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.279
Something you
asked me earlier,

07:59.312 --> 08:01.582
about that night.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.217
You were right,
he was trashed.

08:04.251 --> 08:08.088
But there was something else
about Ochoa that bugged me.

08:08.121 --> 08:08.789
How can we help?

08:10.791 --> 08:12.593
The interrogation
transcripts

08:12.626 --> 08:15.228
made it onto
Sophe, right?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.130
But not the actual video.
Yeah.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.702
I'm going back to PD
to go over the physical tapes.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.141
I'm an idiot.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.210
What?

08:30.243 --> 08:33.647
I know where to find
pictures of Mia...

08:33.681 --> 08:35.215
where this monster
couldn't possibly

08:35.248 --> 08:37.551
have gotten ahold of them.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.636
Hey.
Hey.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.237
You didn't have to
come down.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.607
You could have just
sent David with the key.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.142
I wanted to know
why you wanted it.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.750
I think there may be a picture
of Mia's killer in there.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.253
Are you serious, Jeffrey?

09:13.286 --> 09:16.590
Yeah. Her scrapbooks,
from when she traveled.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.959
She made one
after the Europe trip.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.294
Yeah, but, Jeffrey,
the police went through

09:21.328 --> 09:22.896
all of this stuff already.

09:22.930 --> 09:23.964
But they didn't know
what they were looking for.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.365
Hmm.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.834
Now we do.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.669
All right.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.708
I, um...

09:34.742 --> 09:36.877
It's just...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.880
when they asked me what to do
with all of her stuff,

09:39.913 --> 09:43.884
you know, I just, um...
couldn't deal with it.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.853
So I just, I had two
of the interns come

09:45.886 --> 09:47.988
and packaged
it up and...
Yeah.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.257
I'm sorry that I didn't
help you more.
No.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.625
I was, you know...

09:51.659 --> 09:53.293
I know.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.297
Okay, so, let's do it.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.232
You don't have to do this.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.903
No. We face it together.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.272
Come on.
Okay.

10:11.879 --> 10:14.648
*

10:30.964 --> 10:33.333
ALEX :
Jeffrey?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.268
Jeffrey?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.273
Remember, these are just
things, they aren't her.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.842
Okay. Yeah.
Okay?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.845
Okay? Say it.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.014
They're just things.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.349
They're...

10:49.382 --> 10:50.984
They're not her.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.430
*

11:22.950 --> 11:25.385
Mr. Ochoa.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.056
CAVANAUGH:
Hey.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.859
Mr. Ochoa, do you know
where you are?

11:35.128 --> 11:37.464
What was that?

11:37.497 --> 11:39.332
Mia.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.868
She here?

11:40.901 --> 11:43.904
What about Mia,
Mr. Ochoa?

11:45.939 --> 11:48.375
I...

11:48.408 --> 11:50.410
I can't leave it like this.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.379
You can't leave it like what?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.482
You can't leave it
like what, Carlos?

11:57.484 --> 11:59.853
Is this how you left her?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.454
You killed her,
didn't you, Carlos?

12:01.488 --> 12:02.890
No.

12:02.923 --> 12:06.026
No. No.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.161
You were outside her place.
No.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.496
You got in a fight earlier.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.164
The neighbors overheard you.
No.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.034
She was breaking it off
with you, right, Carlos?
No.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.803
Is that why you killed her,
Carlos?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.170
Because you didn't want
anyone else to have her?

12:17.204 --> 12:19.106
Carlos.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.778
This isn't working.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.046
Well, where are you going?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.981
He's strung out.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.383
Nothing he says
will be admissible now, anyway.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.885
We get him to crack now.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.020
He's already cracked.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.187
That's the problem.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.890
Sweet dreams, Carlos.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.768
*

13:15.128 --> 13:16.864
How you feeling?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.534
Carlos, we're gonna
ask you some questions.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.004
Some of them
we know the answers to.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.006
Some of them we don't.
Your best shot

13:26.039 --> 13:27.841
through this
is just telling the truth.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.012
I relapsed.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.214
:
Yeah.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.849
I threw away 18 months.

13:35.883 --> 13:36.984
That's the truth.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.152
Well, good. That's a good start.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.955
But we're gonna need
to go back before then.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.623
Mia Tanner.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.258
What about Mia?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.027
You went to go see her.
When?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.862
9:30. 10:00.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.130
The neighbors heard you arguing.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.999
You had a fight?

13:52.032 --> 13:54.601
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I guess we did.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.937
She wanted
to break it off, right?

13:56.970 --> 14:00.540
No. No, no, she...
she had already broken it off.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.275
I was trying to
convince her,

14:02.309 --> 14:04.477
but that didn't go over so well.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.546
And so I went down
to the Tenderloin,

14:06.579 --> 14:08.281
and I found
a dude that was holding,

14:08.315 --> 14:10.117
and I bought a bag.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.456
Why am I here?

14:16.489 --> 14:19.126
Why do you think you're here?

14:19.159 --> 14:21.628
Possession?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.999
Drunk and disorderly?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.503
Um, Mia didn't have anything
to do with this.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.940
I...

14:32.973 --> 14:35.642
I'm an addict.

14:35.675 --> 14:39.112
Um, and I...
I made the decision.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.199
:
What?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.203
Mia. Mia.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.672
Who did this?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.307
You did, Carlos.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.209
We found you at the scene.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.643
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.678
CARLOS:
You have to find...

15:12.612 --> 15:13.080
you have to find
the people that did this.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.184
I didn't do this.
This was not me.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.052
No, no, no, you have to find
the people that did this.

15:19.086 --> 15:19.652
No.

15:28.996 --> 15:32.132
RUIZ: That's when
you decided, isn't it?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.067
Yeah, I guess so.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.174
He had a key to her place.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.710
They got in a fight
earlier that night.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.980
We found his DNA on her.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.149
And all I got is a gut feeling.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.589
God, maybe I should have
kept my mouth shut.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.265
Oh, my gosh.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.100
Jeffrey, do you remember this?

16:07.134 --> 16:09.202
Me doing all the heavy
lifting while you read?

16:09.236 --> 16:12.072
Yes. Yes, I do.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.142
I swear this feels
like a lifetime ago.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.577
Oh, my gosh.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.279
Jeffrey, look at this.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.014
Do you remember this?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.183
:
Oh, my God.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.584
TANNER:
Who was that? Doctor, um...

16:24.617 --> 16:26.586
ALEX:
Dr. Bloom.
Yeah.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.221
We told her
we didn't want to know...
That's right.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.756
...and she just blurted it
right on out.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.791
"It's a girl." Yeah.
"It's a girl."

16:31.824 --> 16:35.328
Life's last great
surprise, ruined.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.331
Mm, not totally ruined. No.

16:44.371 --> 16:48.175
How could somebody
do this to her

16:48.208 --> 16:50.310
Why would they
do this to her?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.145
:
I don't know.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.785
Hey, Sara.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.288
This doesn't look good.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.156
Mia's hard drive.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.691
The killer
didn't just erase

17:04.724 --> 17:06.659
the pictures,
he blew away the sectors.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.661
Overwrote the data,
so there's no way to restore.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.231
Whatever was on there,
it's gone, like, really gone.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.434
Well...

17:14.467 --> 17:17.104
it was always a long shot.

17:17.137 --> 17:21.674
At least, now we know
he's extremely tech-savvy.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.445
Which is, you know, it's another
detail for the list,

17:25.478 --> 17:27.447
and a very useful one.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.355
Something else?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.857
Um, yeah, so...

17:37.890 --> 17:40.293
We're just worried about you.
Yeah.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.829
Why?
Well, we just found out

17:42.862 --> 17:44.264
that you were dating Tanner,

17:45.398 --> 17:47.134
and then we found out
that you had broke up with him.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.137
Now you're acting, like,
24% weird.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.106
Or 76% normal, so it could
just be a rounding error.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.442
It's just that you're not
talking about it at all.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.410
Because...

17:57.444 --> 18:00.447
only Americans think you have
to talk everything to death.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.250
BOTH:
We're worried about you.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.752
:
You've... you've said.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.122
This is going badly, isn't it?
I think it is.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.858
Look, we're...
we're not just your coworkers.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.794
Or at least, I don't think
we're just your--

18:14.827 --> 18:16.496
Are we just
your co
No.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.365
No.

18:18.398 --> 18:23.470
You are also my friends, and
I appreciate your concern,

18:23.503 --> 18:25.872
but Jeffrey and I would like

18:25.905 --> 18:28.275
to keep what happened
between us private.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.276
So something did happen.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.810
Oh, bloody hell.
Sara?

18:32.379 --> 18:34.147
I think you need to see this.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.482
Thank you, Megan.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.717
You have no idea what
you just saved me from.

18:37.750 --> 18:38.885
Excuse me.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.220
This just came in.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.821
He said it was about
Carlos Ochoa.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.256
That it might be important.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.491
You can't run away
from us forever.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.293
We still work here.

18:46.326 --> 18:50.263
Megan, how would you like
to take over their jobs?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.432
Mister...?
Glennon.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.834
HARRY :
Glennon.
Mr. Glennon. How can I help?

18:54.867 --> 18:57.170
You're trying to find
who killed Mia Tanner, right?

18:57.204 --> 18:59.206
Yes. Do you know something
that could help us?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.774
Well, I don't know
who killed her,

19:01.808 --> 19:03.776
but I know who didn't.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.812
Carlos Ochoa.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.948
See, uh, I was with him
that night.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.884
I guess I'm his alibi.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.460
See, the thing you have
to understand is,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.195
up until a few weeks ago,
I was still married.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.532
And my wife wasn't, uh...

19:25.565 --> 19:27.834
Understanding?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.270
Yes. Precisely.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.638
But now the divorce
is finalized...

19:31.671 --> 19:33.540
And there's a new
Mrs. Glennon?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.475
Oh, no. No, I'm not making
that mistake again.

19:37.244 --> 19:40.547
Uh... I-I've just been
living with this for a year,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.715
and now I can finally speak up.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.318
I just, I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't come forward before...

19:45.352 --> 19:47.920
Wait, so you were
with Carlos Ochoa?

19:47.954 --> 19:51.491
He was there when I went in.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.592
Went in where?

19:52.625 --> 19:55.228
My room. At the...

19:56.529 --> 19:57.830
...City Center Hotel.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.998
It's a-a...

19:59.031 --> 20:00.767
Gentleman's hotel.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.869
Yeah.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.638
Yeah. I was there
maybe... two hours.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.006
Um, and...

20:07.039 --> 20:09.276
when I got to the room,
he was passed out,

20:09.309 --> 20:10.810
high as a kite,
right outside my door.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.679
And then,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.815
when I came out,
he was still there.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.016
Are you sure it was him?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.551
Yeah. Positive.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.952
I-I remember 'cause his face

20:19.986 --> 20:23.756
was all over the news,
but I couldn't...

20:23.790 --> 20:25.258
Right, right, right.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.926
I don't suppose
you kept the receipt?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.729
No, not really
that kind of place.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.899
What about your date?
Can she corroborate any of this?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.834
Uh, I mean...

20:34.867 --> 20:37.537
she could, if you can find her.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.640
Well, maybe at
the, uh, City Center...

20:40.673 --> 20:42.309
Hotel.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.943
At least,
that's where she, um...

20:43.976 --> 20:46.546
worked, back then, anyway.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.024
CAVANAUGH: Hey.
Hey, you, Destiny.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.959
Hey, hey, stop
right there.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.961
You are Destiny, right?

21:03.963 --> 21:06.633
Standing around isn't a crime.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.935
I'm not vice,
I just got some questions.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.672
Hey, if I was trying to entrap
you, would I hit my siren?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.574
Come on.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.343
Just give me a few minutes.

21:18.711 --> 21:22.014
Lucky for you,
you're so handsome.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.788
There we go.
Okay.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.956
All right.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.958
Easy does it.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.844
What is that?

21:54.046 --> 21:58.385
Okay, now, Jeffrey,

21:58.418 --> 22:01.688
even if we don't
find anything in here,

22:01.721 --> 22:04.323
coming here was still worth it,
right

22:12.031 --> 22:14.033
Okay, here's Prague.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.379
That's it?

22:27.780 --> 22:29.649
Ugh!

22:43.730 --> 22:45.732
Hey, Jeffrey?

22:45.765 --> 22:47.734
Jeffrey?
I can't.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.402
You can.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.073
Look.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.443
Jeffrey, look.

23:04.984 --> 23:08.054
Do you know
any of these people?

23:08.087 --> 23:09.489
No, which
means that...

23:09.522 --> 23:11.491
He could be one of them.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.193
TANNER: Which one is he?

23:14.226 --> 23:17.530
Which one's what?

23:17.564 --> 23:19.732
Black Sheep--
is he one of them?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.033
Right here.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.871
I-I don't know. I...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.939
I-I only saw him once.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.808
He was wearing a hat.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.910
He could... he could be
any one of those dudes.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.946
Yeah, but you said that
you could identify him, right?

23:33.980 --> 23:38.150
No. That's why I told you
about the picture in the phone.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.519
No, no, there is...
The picture's gone.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.920
All right? He deleted it.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.522
Okay?

23:42.555 --> 23:45.024
So, please, just-just
look one more time, Carlos.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.125
Okay, that's
enough for now.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.495
Jeffrey.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.129
Please.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.468
Doctor, is he gonna be okay?
I mean, this is...

23:55.502 --> 23:57.103
The problem is they're
gonna return him

23:57.136 --> 23:58.571
to the prison
hospital soon.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.573
What?
Wait. They can't.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.943
He can't be moved like that.
Technically, he can.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.145
The pericardial tamponade
drained the fluid

24:06.178 --> 24:08.948
and relieves the
pressure from his heart.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.983
But the next few
days are critical.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.752
He needs to be
monitored closely.
Okay.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.121
He can't get that in a
prison hospital, trust me.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.256
Well, then we can't
move him to a prison hospital.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.859
Right, but it's not
that simple, Mr. Tanner.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.962
The Department of Corrections
does what it does.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.197
I'm on it. I'll call.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.799
Okay.
I should get
back in there.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.768
All right.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.547
CAVANAUGH:
Should be heading this way.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.148
Hey, baby boy.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.950
I remember you.
Where you been?

24:43.983 --> 24:47.153
Oh, man. Okay.

24:47.186 --> 24:51.824
Yeah. He wasn't so embarrassed
when he was calling me "Mommy."

24:54.060 --> 24:56.228
I remember
that night, sure.

24:56.262 --> 25:00.266
This kid was wrecked
out of his mind,

25:00.299 --> 25:02.068
passed out by the door.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.170
And you'd be willing to
give a written statement

25:04.203 --> 25:06.038
of everything you
remember from that night?

25:06.072 --> 25:09.175
Wait. Hold up.

25:09.208 --> 25:14.313
Um... I meant to say,
I think I remember.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.082
Uh-huh.

25:16.115 --> 25:20.186
Yeah. If you want me
to fully remember...

25:20.219 --> 25:21.921
I got to get paid.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.191
It doesn't quite
work like that.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.326
Didn't the guy
that started this thing

25:27.359 --> 25:29.596
offer up a hundred mil for help?

25:31.831 --> 25:34.934
Come on. This has to be worth
at least, like, what?

25:34.967 --> 25:37.136
50 grand?

25:39.238 --> 25:42.141
Look, tell us what you know,
and we'll see what we can do.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.212
Man, please.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.648
My memory's fading
by the second.

25:51.918 --> 25:55.221
Sara, we pay criminal informants
at PD all the time.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.089
That is a slippery slope.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.358
Once you pay her, other people
start wanting to be paid, too.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.694
Money distorts
user motivation.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.229
Someone has information
that we need?

26:03.262 --> 26:05.965
Yes.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.067
Okay. Pay 'em.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.869
Jeffrey, we've discussed this.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.704
Sophe isn't about
doling money out.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.105
Yeah, but we offered a reward.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.607
Which you intended
would be split

26:14.641 --> 26:16.242
among everyone
that participated.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.945
The reward was
to grab attention.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.980
People are returning because
of the day-to-day interaction.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.115
It's not about cash,
it's about community.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.117
If we lose that,
we lose everything.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.887
Sara, I hear everything
you're saying,

26:27.920 --> 26:29.255
and everything you're saying
is true, but right now,

26:29.288 --> 26:31.390
I don't care. Pay 'em.
All right, great.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.325
ALEX: Just let them know
it's urgent. Thanks.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.028
I have a call in
to Kamala's office

26:36.062 --> 26:38.364
and to Sacramento, but they're
not sure if we can stop them

26:38.397 --> 26:40.132
from transferring
Carlos.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.301
Why should anything be easy?

26:42.334 --> 26:45.237
Okay, can you please
put this up on Sophe?

26:45.271 --> 26:46.673
SARA:
Where's it from?

26:46.706 --> 26:49.108
ALEX: Mia's scrapbook
from her trip to Europe.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.409
Could be nothing, but we...

26:50.442 --> 26:51.744
TANNER:
I get it.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.179
I get it, all right?

26:53.212 --> 26:55.014
None of this is gonna work out.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.183
I'm chasing a ghost.
I'm the only one that cares.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.018
It's fine, all right?

26:59.051 --> 27:01.153
I'll do it alone.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.695
Okay, on that note...

27:21.073 --> 27:22.975
Do you fancy a drink?

27:40.326 --> 27:43.195
I know that...

27:43.229 --> 27:47.199
Sophe wasn't something...

27:47.233 --> 27:49.201
that you were okay with.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.973
I should've made Jeffrey
talk to you about it, but...

27:54.006 --> 27:56.375
Please, Sara.

27:56.408 --> 27:59.211
Nobody can get him to do
anything he doesn't want to do.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.347
Good point.

28:01.380 --> 28:05.184
Besides, it's not that
I don't want to find out

28:05.217 --> 28:06.753
what really happened. I do.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.421
Just, when I think about

28:09.455 --> 28:12.091
whoever did this to Mia,
you know, I...

28:12.124 --> 28:16.095
I don't know... how...

28:16.128 --> 28:18.497
I would be able
to forgive them, you know.

28:18.530 --> 28:22.501
For the longest time...

28:22.534 --> 28:24.503
it was Carlos's face,

28:24.536 --> 28:26.739
and...

28:26.773 --> 28:30.409
I just wanted to punish him...

28:30.442 --> 28:32.278
and hate him...

28:32.311 --> 28:35.514
Wanting justice
isn't unreasonable.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.385
Sara, it wasn't about justice.
It was about vengeance.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.487
I want to see

28:41.520 --> 28:44.523
whoever did this to my daughter
burn in hell.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.392
Instead,

28:46.425 --> 28:48.861
someone else might lose
their baby as well.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.763
That isn't an option.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.166
It can't be.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.213
What
What is that?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.849
Our, um, informants.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.517
Something felt wrong about them,

29:11.550 --> 29:14.220
so-so I put their picture up
on Sophe, and...

29:14.253 --> 29:15.521
they're married.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.323
They're bloody con artists.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.196
Stop him!
Stop him now. Now!

29:24.230 --> 29:24.831
CAVANAUGH:
Hey! Hey!

29:28.901 --> 29:29.869
You son of a bitch!

29:29.902 --> 29:31.170
You want to make money

29:31.203 --> 29:32.571
off my daughter's death?!

29:32.604 --> 29:34.573
Hey, hey!
Jeffrey! No!

29:34.606 --> 29:36.809
Get off.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.444
Get off. Come on.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.312
Come on.
I got him. All right.
I'm all right.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.181
You good?
Yeah.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.249
Huh?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.184
You want some of this?

29:45.217 --> 29:47.219
Take it. Take it all.
All right, okay...

29:58.998 --> 30:02.935
Okay, so run me through
Black Sheep again.

30:02.969 --> 30:06.105
Mia has this on-again,
off-again thing with Ochoa.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.841
All right, during this time,
she reconnects with this guy.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.510
Probably a rich kid,
jealous type.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.513
Maybe he finds out

30:14.546 --> 30:16.849
Mia and Carlos are still
hooking up, gets pissed,

30:16.883 --> 30:19.919
and makes her
break it off with him.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.453
She's forcing him
out the door because

30:21.487 --> 30:23.422
this Black Sheep is
on his way over.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.524
The question is:
why didn't she call the cops?

30:25.557 --> 30:28.527
Do I really have to run down
domestic abuse stats for you?

30:31.030 --> 30:33.432
So, she...

30:33.465 --> 30:35.567
she thinks that he's
gonna be jealous,

30:35.601 --> 30:38.170
but that he won't
hurt her.
Okay.

30:38.204 --> 30:42.208
Tanner said that Mia always
saw the best in people, right?

30:42.241 --> 30:44.076
Yeah.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.978
Yeah, he did.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.547
All right, let's just
go over it again.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.254
Hold up.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.523
What, you see something?

30:57.556 --> 31:00.026
Can you pull up this shot
from the first interrogation?

31:00.059 --> 31:00.993
Yeah.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.568
You see it?

31:12.238 --> 31:13.973
The logo is gone.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.142
Why'd he switch clothes?

31:16.175 --> 31:18.644
CAVANAUGH: So the roster says
you were on the desk

31:18.677 --> 31:21.113
the night of September 26th
to the 27th?

31:21.147 --> 31:23.649
If you say so. The nights
all blend together for me.

31:23.682 --> 31:24.450
RUIZ:
This was a big one.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.919
The night Mia Tanner
was murdered.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.989
Oh, yeah, the night
Ochoa came in. That was me.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.191
At some point during the night,
his clothes were changed.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.625
For the evidence search.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.961
After that.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.929
He was in a pair
of PD scrubs,

31:36.963 --> 31:38.497
but in the morning,
he was wearing a different pair.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.600
You remember why?

31:41.633 --> 31:44.103
Yeah, because was
puking all over himself.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.304
Here.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.940
After you guys
released him

31:47.974 --> 31:49.942
from interrogation,
about an hour or so after that,

31:49.976 --> 31:52.111
he started getting sick,
coming out of both ends,

31:52.144 --> 31:53.645
so I called a medic.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.214
They checked him out,
put him on fluids.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.283
We trashed the old clothes
and put him in new ones.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.251
Why weren't we told about this?

31:59.285 --> 32:02.521
He was a junkie coming down.
He never even left his cell.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.690
The medic said it was heroin.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.658
That or food poisoning.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.360
Frankly, I didn't care then,
and I really don't care now.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.262
You're true blue, Hoff.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.998
Hey, you know what?

32:12.031 --> 32:13.699
At least I didn't...
Don't finish that sentence.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.141
Food poisoning.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.976
Maybe. It could have
been anything.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.012
But it's still something
we didn't know before.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.346
It's a start.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.718
Sara, I got something
for Sophe.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.686
(Tanner grunting,
hitting bag)

32:47.333 --> 32:50.169
Hey-hey. Hi.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.671
I think you've hit

32:52.704 --> 32:54.373
enough things
for one day, don't you?

32:56.342 --> 32:58.044
If you need time
to sulk,

32:58.077 --> 32:59.678
I can come back.

33:05.717 --> 33:08.287
Jeffrey, look,
I know this is painful.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.721
And you have been staring

33:09.755 --> 33:12.024
at this thing in the face
every single day.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.225
It sucks.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.760
But that's too damn bad.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.628
This was your choice.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.630
My choice?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.666
I never had a choice.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.169
I was the only one that believed

33:23.202 --> 33:25.204
her real killer
was still out there.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.706
What... So what do you want?
Do you want a trophy?

33:27.739 --> 33:30.609
Jeffrey,
your entire life,

33:30.642 --> 33:32.778
you've built up walls
around you to keep people out,

33:32.811 --> 33:35.647
to sabotage relationships--
your parents,

33:35.681 --> 33:38.750
me, Mia, and now
those people downstairs.

33:38.784 --> 33:42.621
At some point,
you're gonna have to realize

33:42.654 --> 33:45.791
that this is nobody's fault
but your own.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.659
You decided to pick up
this boulder.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.195
Now you have to continue

33:49.228 --> 33:52.464
to carry it
up the hill.

33:52.498 --> 33:56.235
I would stop moping
and get back to work.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.681
You'd think, considering
it's after midnight,

34:09.715 --> 34:11.417
we'd have less users.

34:11.450 --> 34:14.386
Well, everyone has a great
"one time I puked" story.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.821
This one time,
when I was eight years old,

34:15.854 --> 34:17.823
I drank three cans
of orange soda,

34:17.856 --> 34:19.858
and puked all
over my cousin.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.128
He's never forgiven
me to this day.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.362
That's nothing.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.197
I once, um, met this-this bloke

34:25.231 --> 34:27.433
in a pub, after school...

34:27.466 --> 34:29.801
Rupert? Something or other.

34:29.835 --> 34:33.172
Anyway, after about
five pints too many,

34:33.205 --> 34:36.675
we went outside to snog and I...

34:36.708 --> 34:38.144
No.
Oh!

34:38.177 --> 34:39.145
Come on.
It was terrible.

34:40.712 --> 34:41.447
:
I was mortified.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.681
It was so horrible.

34:42.714 --> 34:43.849
That's disgusting.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.751
You guys okay?

34:45.784 --> 34:47.253
Yeah, sorry.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.420
We are all... fine.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.893
SARA: I-It's the picture
from Mia's scrapbook.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.262
We found one of the men.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.163
ALEX:
Who is it?

34:57.196 --> 34:59.465
Olivier Durand.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.233
He was in France
at the time of the murder,

35:01.267 --> 35:04.136
so it can't have been him,
but he may know something.

35:04.170 --> 35:07.206
See if he can talk to us,
and we'll take it in my office.

35:07.239 --> 35:10.276
OLIVIER:
Mr. Tanner, Ms. Hale,

35:10.309 --> 35:11.910
I'm so sorry about Mia.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.714
I did not know her well,
but she was lovely.

35:15.747 --> 35:16.915
Yeah, she was.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.484
Thank you.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.252
So you met her in Prague?

35:20.286 --> 35:23.289
Yes. Um, just for a day or two.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.557
I followed the story here.
I would have reached out,

35:25.591 --> 35:28.560
but I had no idea
there was anything I could do.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.297
Was there another man,
when you were with her?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.233
Someone that she had a nickname
for, like, a-a Dutch name.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.901
Yes. In fact, there was.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.504
I only met him
for a few minutes, though.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.372
Uh, and he's in the photograph?

35:40.406 --> 35:41.507
Unfortunately, no.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.842
Um, he would have been, but...

35:43.875 --> 35:46.778
he's actually the one
who took the photograph.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.847
Is there anything that you can
remember that would help us?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.449
Anything at all?

35:50.482 --> 35:53.352
Well, there may be
one other thing, actually.

35:53.385 --> 35:58.857
I remember, I asked Mia
how she knew this man.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.459
And she said...

36:00.492 --> 36:03.362
she said she knew him
through you, Mr. Tanner.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.466
Uh... Okay, well, thank you

36:07.499 --> 36:08.867
so much
for your help.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.836
Of course.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.274
Uh, y-you should
come and see this.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.809
So we ran the, um,
vomit question.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.312
But when we put it up on Sophe,
we discovered a pattern.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.880
Well, a-an outbreak, actually.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.515
Clostridium perfringens.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.817
It's a bacterium
that causes food poisoning.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.319
A number of our users report
getting it

36:27.353 --> 36:28.554
the night of Mia's death.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.589
And one of our users
is an ER nurse

36:30.622 --> 36:32.291
who says she that treated

36:32.324 --> 36:33.859
at least a dozen cases of it
that night.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.394
She checked the records,

36:35.427 --> 36:37.563
and they all are tied up
to this place.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.965
This street fair,
and more specifically,

36:39.998 --> 36:41.267
this food cart.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.434
They all ate there.

36:42.468 --> 36:43.835
Where was this street fair?

36:43.869 --> 36:45.504
About two miles
from Mia's apartment.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.905
Right by the Tenderloin.
Okay, so...

36:46.938 --> 36:48.874
So Ochoa gets high,
goes to the street fair,

36:48.907 --> 36:50.442
eats poisoned pig...

36:50.476 --> 36:52.244
And then, he goes
back to Mia's place

36:52.278 --> 36:53.912
where we pick him up outside.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.647
Which means that he could've
been at this street fair

36:55.681 --> 36:57.883
at the time that Mia was killed.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.319
Well, that's all well and good,
but we still have to prove it.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.354
Well, we better do it quickly.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.323
They're transferring Ochoa
back to the prison hospital

37:04.356 --> 37:05.891
first thing tomorrow.
ALEX: I have a call
into the judge...

37:05.924 --> 37:07.593
Well, we need to go
higher up than that.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.628
Well, I can head up to Solano,
and see if we can stall them.

37:09.661 --> 37:10.896
Can I come?

37:10.929 --> 37:11.997
Yes, ma'am.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.932
Ladies and gentlemen.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.302
It's time to save
Carlos Ochoa's life.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.010
I'm not finding anything
on Carlos.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.878
Even if we find him there,
how do we stop them

37:26.912 --> 37:28.914
from moving him back to prison?

37:28.947 --> 37:30.449
Alex is on it.
We just need to find something

37:30.482 --> 37:31.617
for her to work with.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.852
We're getting lots of partials.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.355
This is gonna take forever.

37:36.388 --> 37:40.359
Guys, I've got something here.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.361
SARA:
What?

37:42.394 --> 37:44.496
This guy, he-he takes

37:44.530 --> 37:46.398
ultra-high-resolution
gigapixel photos

37:46.432 --> 37:48.467
using a computer-controlled
camera.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.036
The organizers of the event
hired him to take this.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.504
CAVANAUGH:
You can't make out anybody
on this thing.

37:52.538 --> 37:53.872
I mean, it's too wide.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.541
Yeah, until you zoom in.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.911
That's what's so special
about a gigapixel photo.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.647
The clarity is perfect,
no matter how close you are.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.482
TARIQ:
That's so awesome.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.083
Yeah. Okay,
now we're looking for a needle

38:05.116 --> 38:06.918
in a stack of needles?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.053
Yeah, that's where
Sophe comes in.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.321
Divide and conquer.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.622
A crowd speciality.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.958
We'll get each
user to examine

38:12.991 --> 38:15.093
a chunk of the picture,
they'll say yes or no to it,

38:15.126 --> 38:16.928
and then, they'll move
on to another chunk.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.530
We'll build in
a system of doubles

38:18.564 --> 38:19.865
to make sure
there's overlap

38:19.898 --> 38:21.066
and multiple eyes
everywhere.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.568
Now, doing the math.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.536
This photo's from 11:01 p.m.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.005
Time of death
is between 10:30 and 11:00.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.840
Yeah. This is two miles
from Mia's apartment.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.676
It's late, cabs are a
huge pain in this area,

38:30.709 --> 38:32.678
e-especially with
an event going on.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.613
There's no way he would've got
to her place in that window.

38:34.646 --> 38:39.385
If Carlos is in this picture,
it proves he didn't kill Mia.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.620
Yeah, it's an urgent matter.
I know that it's early,

38:41.653 --> 38:43.989
but I... I know.
No, I realize that,

38:44.022 --> 38:45.391
and I'm sorry for
calling so early,
Alex, please!

38:45.424 --> 38:47.393
but...
Sorry, hold on.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.560
I need to call you back.
MARIA:
They're taking him.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.362
Ma'am, we were given orders
to move him.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.864
I understand that, but we're
gonna need a couple of hours.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.866
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
Lieutenant, but we were
given orders.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.968
You're a little out
of your jurisdiction up here.

38:57.002 --> 38:57.936
Okay, no. Officer.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.107
Officer Crosby,
do you know who I am?

39:02.140 --> 39:04.410
Yes, Congresswoman.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.711
Okay. Perfect, good.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.413
This man was
wrongfully convicted

39:07.446 --> 39:08.680
of murdering my daughter.

39:08.714 --> 39:09.981
Right now, we're trying
to prove his innocence,

39:10.015 --> 39:11.417
clear his name,

39:11.450 --> 39:12.918
so he can be released.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.587
If you take him back to
prison, he will die.

39:15.621 --> 39:16.488
Look at me.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.458
I need you to
leave him here,

39:19.491 --> 39:21.593
make sure that he's safe
and secure,

39:21.627 --> 39:23.429
and if you don't follow
my instructions,

39:23.462 --> 39:24.663
I will destroy you.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.099
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

39:28.133 --> 39:29.701
Yes, ma'am.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.503
Then, go.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.075
:
Okay.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.516
I've got a good one.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.459
Damn it, it's not him.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.530
Of course it isn't.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.511
Hey.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.045
You good?

40:14.079 --> 40:15.681
It's not my day.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.649
It ain't over yet.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.585
The guy from Mia's scrapbook,

40:19.618 --> 40:21.653
who I talked to?
Yeah?

40:21.687 --> 40:24.723
He said that she knows about
Black Sheep because of me.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.058
I introduced her to him.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.160
Tanner, it's not your fault.

40:29.194 --> 40:32.130
Yeah.
Look, man.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.566
You can't try to find meaning
in everything.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.168
Yeah.
The only thing
that got us here now

40:37.202 --> 40:39.705
is an interrogation room camera
pointing in the right angle.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.509
That's the hardest part
of this job.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.043
I mean, yeah, sure.

40:45.076 --> 40:48.113
Training, experience,
it means something.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.114
But so does luck.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.982
The truth is,

40:51.016 --> 40:54.085
I could've been
completely wrong.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.687
But you weren't.

40:55.721 --> 40:58.990
But what happens
when it goes the other way?

40:59.024 --> 41:01.993
When I am convinced
an innocent person is guilty,

41:02.027 --> 41:05.764
and I do everything I can
to make it stick?

41:07.132 --> 41:08.734
SARA:
We've got something.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.235
Come on.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.570
It's not over.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.539
Let's go.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.744
Okay.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.514
Cross everything.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.088
And there he is.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.591
CAVANAUGH:
With a bacon-wrapped hot dog.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.661
We did it?

41:35.694 --> 41:38.063
We did it.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.131
We did it!

41:40.165 --> 41:41.132
Yeah, good job, good job.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.568
JOSH:
It worked.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.869
Thank you, for everything.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.808
Sure.

42:22.841 --> 42:25.844
I mean, any chance
I get to yell at you, and...

42:25.877 --> 42:28.146
point out one
of your many, many flaws,

42:28.179 --> 42:29.114
I'm gonna happily take it.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.849
Yes.

42:30.882 --> 42:33.151
I get that.
Mm-hmm.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.354
You're gonna find
the son of a bitch, Jeffrey.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.690
I know that you will.

42:39.858 --> 42:42.293
We will.
