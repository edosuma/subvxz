00:48.916 --> 00:53.087
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.625
I'm X Ray Cat.
I've got super powers.

00:57.691 --> 01:02.130
I can see through
wooden doors
with my X-ray vision.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.565
I can see the criminal
on the other side.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.168
He can't see me,
and he's committing crime.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.304
I come along and say,
"I can see you!"
He says, "You can't see me."

01:10.371 --> 01:14.875
I say, "Yes, I can
with my... doo-doo-doo-doo...

01:14.942 --> 01:16.910
"X Ray... doo-doo-doo-doo...

01:16.977 --> 01:19.012
X Ray Cat."

01:19.079 --> 01:22.383
"You can't get me!
You can't get me!"
"Yes, I can. Yes, I can.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.752
Doo-doo-doo-doo.
Yes, I can."

01:24.818 --> 01:27.555
See... the bananas?

01:27.621 --> 01:31.125
I know a banana
who applied for a job
as a telephone repairman.

01:31.192 --> 01:34.328
Guy came and said,
"You want job here?"

01:34.395 --> 01:36.397
He said, "Yeah, I wanna get
a job as a telephone repairman."

01:36.464 --> 01:40.368
He said,
"You got the job!
You got the job, buddy!"

01:40.434 --> 01:42.470
Then the beavers came.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.506
The beaver started yelling
at other beaver.

01:45.573 --> 01:51.512
The beaver started yelling.
He said, "You stupid beaver!

01:51.579 --> 01:53.914
You stupid!"

02:15.068 --> 02:18.138
Bye, Gord!
Good luck!

02:32.019 --> 02:36.557
Hey!
Get off that skateboard!

02:36.624 --> 02:39.460
* Too many problems
Oh, why am I here *

02:39.527 --> 02:42.596
* I need to be me
'cause you're all too clear *

02:42.663 --> 02:45.566
* And I can see there's
something wrong with you *
I'm calling the cops!

02:45.633 --> 02:48.436
* But what do you
expect me to do *

02:48.502 --> 02:51.839
* At least I gotta know
what I wanna be *

02:51.905 --> 02:56.176
* Don't come to me
if you need pity *

02:56.244 --> 02:58.479
* Are you lonely
You got no one *

02:58.546 --> 03:02.182
* You got your body
in suspension *

03:02.250 --> 03:04.017
* That's no problem *

03:04.084 --> 03:07.755
* Problem *

03:07.821 --> 03:11.425
* Problem
The problem is you *

03:23.404 --> 03:26.707
* Eat your heart out
on a plastic tray *

03:31.945 --> 03:35.716
* Problem *

03:35.783 --> 03:38.786
* Problem *

03:38.852 --> 03:43.257
* Problem
The problem is you *

03:45.393 --> 03:49.963
Gordy, honey,
I'm so sad you're leaving.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.100
Why are you moving
to Los Angeles to work
in a cheese factory?

03:53.166 --> 03:55.503
I'm not going to Hollywood
just to work
in a cheese sandwich factory.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.540
I'm going to shop my drawings.
I'm gonna be a famous animator
like Charles Schultz.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.975
You're gonna be fine.
No, I'm gonna be
like Charles Schultz.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.612
That's my boy!
Confidence!

04:04.678 --> 04:07.147
You're a big man now.
You got a job.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.683
Goddamn real job, Gord.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.453
You finally gave up on
those stupid doodlings.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.588
They're not stupid.
They're not stupid.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.458
Whatever, son.
At least you're gettin' out
of Daddy's basement.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.127
Shh, shh.
He has a very nice job.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.664
Look at our little
baby boy's all grown up.
You come here.

04:23.731 --> 04:27.368
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!
Mom, Mom, stop it.
Baby, baby.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.370
Stop it.
Mom, I'm a 28-year-old man.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.406
Hey, baby.
You're a 28-year-old man!
Ooo!

04:32.473 --> 04:35.576
Yeah,
I'm a 28-year-old man.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.845
My bus is about to leave.

04:37.911 --> 04:42.182
So I'm gonna get on it,
and I'm gonna leave... on it.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.918
Son, wait!
What?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.920
You're not taking that bus
to Los Angeles.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.593
You bought me a ticket
on this bus to Los Angeles.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.496
That's not all
he bought you.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.375
There.
It's yours.
Hop in.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.210
Come on. You're drivin'.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.212
It's a Le Baron.

05:12.279 --> 05:16.450
You bet your boots
it's a Le Baron.
Good Car. Convertible.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.986
Geez, a convertible.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.925
It says "#1 Son."
That's me!
I'm the number-one son.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.227
What about me, Mom?

05:27.294 --> 05:29.697
You're number-one son too.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.165
How come Gord gets a Le Baron
and I don't?

05:32.232 --> 05:36.136
- It's 'cause they love me
more than they love you.
- No, no, they don't!

05:36.203 --> 05:38.472
I only see one Le Baron,
Freddy.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.442
I don't see
two Le Barons.
Gordy.

05:41.509 --> 05:46.680
-Hey, knock it off!
-Where's your Le Baron, Freddy?
-Boys, boys.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.517
- How many Le Barons?
Are there two Le Barons?
- Shut up!

05:50.651 --> 05:55.423
Gord, this car
is more than a gift.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.492
It's kind of
an investment in you.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.228
It means,
"I believe in my son."

06:01.294 --> 06:03.831
You be a good man.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.000
Father, I will be
a good man.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.438
You make your daddy proud.
You hear me?

06:10.504 --> 06:13.707
I'm gonna make you proud,
Daddy.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.909
I'm gonna make you
so proud!

06:17.344 --> 06:19.413
You make your daddy proud.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.982
You're gonna be
so proud.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.084
Proud?

06:24.151 --> 06:27.588
Proud!

06:29.122 --> 06:31.992
Get the fuck
outta the way!

06:35.996 --> 06:39.433
Well,

06:39.500 --> 06:42.402
the boy's grown up.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.173
He's finally gone.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.942
Ya-hoo!

06:49.009 --> 06:52.980
Ya-hoo!

06:59.820 --> 07:03.090
* Here in my car
I feel safest of all *

07:03.156 --> 07:06.494
* I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live *

07:06.560 --> 07:09.930
* In cars *

07:11.098 --> 07:14.602
* Here in my car
I can-- **

07:16.604 --> 07:18.639
What are you doin'
to that horse?

07:18.706 --> 07:22.275
This is a stud farm, boy.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.212
Don't climb that fence.
You can't come over here.
I wanna try the horsey.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.550
Oh, oh, oh, this is fun!
Look at me, Daddy!
I'm a farmer.

07:29.617 --> 07:33.854
Oh, this is fun!
Look at me, Daddy!
I'm a farmer.

07:33.921 --> 07:38.726
I'm a farmer, Daddy.
Whoo!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.061
- I'm a farmer!
-  Get the hell out of here!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.833
I'm really proud
of that kid.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.936
Yeah, I think
he's all grown up.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.145
* Whether I'm right *

07:58.211 --> 08:02.482
* Or whether I'm wrong *

08:02.550 --> 08:07.721
* Whether I find the place
in this world
or never belong *

08:09.757 --> 08:13.360
* I gotta be me *

08:13.426 --> 08:17.197
* I gotta be me *

08:17.264 --> 08:23.971
* What else can I be
but what I am *

08:25.472 --> 08:28.275
* I want to live *

08:28.341 --> 08:31.511
* Not merely survive *

08:33.179 --> 08:39.587
* And I won't give up
this dream of life
that keeps me alive *

08:41.121 --> 08:44.124
* I gotta be me *

08:44.191 --> 08:48.461
* I gotta be me *

08:48.528 --> 08:51.699
* Daring to try
To do it or die *

08:51.765 --> 08:55.769
* I've gotta be me *

08:55.836 --> 08:58.171
* I've gotta be free **
Look at me!

08:58.238 --> 09:00.641
I'm sexy!
I'm a sexy boy!

09:00.708 --> 09:03.911
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

09:03.977 --> 09:09.382
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

09:09.449 --> 09:14.454
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
Ding-dong.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.724
That's lunch, everyone.
Back in 45 minutes.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.826
Hey, you guys leaving?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.903
Can I help you?

09:29.970 --> 09:33.306
Excuse me?
Can I help you?
Excuse me!

09:33.373 --> 09:35.308
It's okay.
I'm here with the bag.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.277
The bag?
The bag for the eels.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.546
What?
For the badger.

09:39.613 --> 09:43.851
What?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.720
Hey, hey!
What are you talking about?
It's okay.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.989
- Are you here for delivery?
- Japan Four.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.924
What?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.995
Japan Four?

09:56.864 --> 09:59.599
I brought the package
you guys ordered.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.702
Wait, who's it for?

10:01.769 --> 10:04.772
It's smudged.
I can only make out... "boss."

10:04.838 --> 10:07.941
Mr. Davidson?
Ah...
Davidson?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.944
Dave.
Dave Davidson!
Yeah, Dave Davidson.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.346
That part was really smudged,
okay?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.548
You said "Dave Davidson."
Then it triggered it
in my brain.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.951
Before I didn't see it,
but then you said it,
it triggered in my brain.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.987
He's the head guy?
Yes.

10:20.053 --> 10:24.557
If you wanted to get a TV show
based upon your animations,
he's the guy you would talk to?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.394
Yes!
And he has brown hair?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.697
Blond.
Blond. Blond hair!

10:29.763 --> 10:32.132
I'm looking for someone
who's blond. Blond hair!

10:32.199 --> 10:34.501
Are you a blond?
Are you a blond?

10:34.567 --> 10:38.271
The blond?
He's at lunch,
so I'll take the package.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.208
He's at lunch?
Mm-hmm.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.176
His wife is dead!

10:44.812 --> 10:48.281
- What? Linda?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Linda.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.383
She's dead.
I should tell him.
My God.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.286
Probably best
that I tell him.
Who are you?

10:53.353 --> 10:57.357
I'm... I'm Quincy.
I'm at
the coroner's office.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.127
I'm like a police officer.
I'm like a police officer.

11:00.193 --> 11:04.097
So I should see
Mr. Davidson 'cause
I'm a police officer.
Okay.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.601
He'll be at that restaurant.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.238
He'll be devastated.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.877
God, he loved Linda.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.514
He did love Linda.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.483
I know.

11:23.550 --> 11:27.087
I think that's wonderful
when two people love
one another.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.389
Even though
there's always a chance one
of those two people...

11:29.456 --> 11:33.593
will die a gruesome,
horrible death, that
doesn't make me fear love.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.695
I'm not afraid of love.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.968
Could I be your boyfriend?
I love you.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.204
- Get outta here!
- No, no.
I was just thinking--

11:44.271 --> 11:47.207
A woman is dead.
Linda is dead!

11:47.274 --> 11:49.209
I thought we could grieve
together over the dead Linda.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.511
Over the dead woman!
Over the woman, over the woman.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.548
Fuck off!
You're a skinny loser!

11:55.615 --> 11:58.418
Someone call security!
Don't call them!

11:58.485 --> 12:00.287
Shit!

12:00.353 --> 12:04.557
Security!
Don't call them, okay?
I gotta go.

12:04.624 --> 12:08.095
Listen, you tell Hanna-Barbera
to go fuck themselves, okay?

12:08.161 --> 12:12.800
I got 12 Korean teenagers
in a tiger cage that can draw
a fucking dog wearing a cape!

12:12.866 --> 12:15.668
I'm looking for
a Mr. Dave Davidson!

12:15.735 --> 12:17.604
Are you Dave Davidson?
No.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.773
Are you David Davidson?
David Davidson.
My name's Peter.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.375
I'm looking for
a David Davidson.
I'm a woman.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.545
Okay, did I ask what sex
you are?
No.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.948
Did I ask if you were
David Davidson?
My name is Cheryl.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.950
Um, I'm Dave Davidson.
Is there a problem?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.819
Are you Mr. Davidson?
Really?
Yes, I am.

12:31.885 --> 12:35.322
Yeah, Officer, really.
Is there a problem?
I'm not really a cop.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.692
My name's Gord,
and I want to meet you
to show you my drawings.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.595
Your drawings.
Are you kidding?

12:42.662 --> 12:47.567
Mr. Davidson, I'm an animator.
I've got this show idea I wanna
pitch to you. It's a cartoon.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.003
It's about this cat.
It's got super powers.
It can see through wooden doors.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.940
He solves crimes.
He can fly.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.008
My friends and I,
we all think it's hilarious.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.010
He can fly like this.
It's great!

12:57.077 --> 13:00.914
Listen, I'm glad
your friends enjoy it.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.350
Tell me something.
What do you want?

13:03.416 --> 13:06.887
I want you to help me
make it into a TV show.
Let me get this right.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.290
You wanna barge into
a restaurant dressed like
a fucking English bobby,

13:10.357 --> 13:13.093
and expect someone
to give you a TV show?

13:13.160 --> 13:16.563
I don't know.
Uh... yeah.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.932
Do me a favor.
Leave me alone. Valet?
Please, please.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.134
Please, just look
at my drawings, okay?

13:21.201 --> 13:23.770
Yeah, okay.
Fine, fine.

13:23.837 --> 13:27.507
Okay, it's X Ray Cat.
Except instead of being able
to see through everything,

13:27.574 --> 13:29.442
he can only see through wood.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.145
So if there's something
going on the other side, say,
a wooden door--

13:32.212 --> 13:35.715
- See the criminal?
- I see the criminal,
I see the door.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.085
See through the door, see
the criminal, and save the day.
He saves the day. Okay?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.453
Much to the dismay
of the police,
the dismay of the mayor.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.823
They hate it when people take
the law into their own hands.
Like a Batman.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.859
Like a Batman.
Like the Guardian Angels.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.961
What's that called?
Like a vigilante.
Right.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.264
Like a vigilante!
He's like a vigilante...

13:51.331 --> 13:53.967
uh, cat--

13:57.304 --> 14:00.173
It's a cat who's a vigilante.
It's a cat who is a vigilante.

14:00.240 --> 14:05.512
I got that. Listen.
Your drawings are pretty good,
but it doesn't make any sense.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.647
It's fucking stupid.
Okay?

14:07.714 --> 14:10.317
What you need here
is elevation.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.186
There actually has to be
something that happens
that's actually funny.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.923
What the fuck
is happening here?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.824
That's a banana.
I see the banana, Gord.

14:17.891 --> 14:21.794
String attached.
Bag of eyes on the other end.
I see the string.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.763
Baboon-- Baboon eyes?

14:23.830 --> 14:26.799
With, uh, sauce,

14:26.866 --> 14:29.002
uh, dripping.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.638
Dripping sauce
and a baboon.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.842
See what I mean?

14:35.909 --> 14:39.046
It doesn't make
any sense, Gord.
It sucks!

14:39.112 --> 14:42.349
The drawings are pretty good,
but the characters are lame.

14:42.415 --> 14:46.019
The characters are lame!
I'm a loser!
I wish I was dead!

14:46.086 --> 14:49.522
Gord, lis--
Wait, wait, listen.
Listen, listen.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.891
I'm trying to give you
a piece of advice.
Will you stop?

14:51.959 --> 14:55.295
You've got to figure
these animals out.
You've gotta figure them out.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.365
You gotta get inside
the animals. Okay?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.300
Figure them out.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.803
Will you take that out?
I can't understand.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.539
I gotta get inside
the animals?
Get inside the animals!

15:08.341 --> 15:10.377
I shouldn't blow the brains
outta the back of my skull?

15:10.443 --> 15:13.113
No, you shouldn't blow
the brains outta
the back of your skull.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.984
Look, you wanna play in the
big leagues, you gotta work
on this 24 hours a day.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.652
You gotta give it weeks
and weeks and months and
months and years and years!

15:19.719 --> 15:24.391
And then, if it doesn't
work out, Gord, then blow
your fucking brains out.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.427
I can't work on this all day.
I got a job at
the cheese sandwich factory.

15:27.494 --> 15:31.431
Cheese sandwich factory?
Oh, that's really funny, Gord.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.735
That's true, I gotta
make cheese sandwiches.
I got rent--
Gord.

15:35.802 --> 15:40.307
You really wanna be an animator,
maybe you should quit
the shitty cheese job.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.376
Think about it,
all right?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.945
I--

15:59.426 --> 16:03.997
Gord, you really
wanna be an animator?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.566
Get inside the animals.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.270
Get inside the animals.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.614
You were a big boy,
weren't you?

16:31.024 --> 16:33.260
Oh, stinky.

16:33.326 --> 16:37.830
* I'd like to build
the world a home *

16:37.897 --> 16:39.966
* And furnish it with love *

16:40.033 --> 16:46.439
* Grow apple trees and honeybees
and snow-white turtle doves *

16:47.774 --> 16:51.311
* I'd like to teach
the world to sing *

16:51.378 --> 16:55.315
* In perfect harmony *

16:55.382 --> 16:57.917
* I'd like to hold it
in my arms *

16:57.984 --> 17:01.121
* And keep it company **

17:14.601 --> 17:16.903
Holy shit!

17:23.310 --> 17:26.146
I-I-I wasn't expecting
that to happen.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.566
* We're a happy family
We're a happy family *

17:46.633 --> 17:49.902
* We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy *

17:49.969 --> 17:51.838
* We're a happy family
We're a happy family *

17:51.904 --> 17:55.508
* We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy *

17:55.575 --> 17:58.378
* Sitting here in Queens
eating refried beans *

17:58.445 --> 18:02.215
Gord, thank God
you're back!

18:12.992 --> 18:15.362
There we go.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.567
Hello?

18:20.633 --> 18:24.003
Listen, Gordy's gonna be
a little upset
about being back home,

18:24.070 --> 18:26.072
so just be nice.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.841
I'm home.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.981
Gordy, why don't you sit
at the table.
We're having roast beef.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.150
Why do you guys
always have roast beef?

18:37.217 --> 18:40.153
Behold Little Lord Fauntleroy's
tummy hurts...

18:40.220 --> 18:44.291
because there's too much
roast beef in it.
It's just boring.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.627
- I'm eating a chicken sandwich.
-  No, you're not!

18:47.694 --> 18:50.397
Holy shit, this is crazy.
I'm a 28-year-old man!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.965
I should be able to eat
a chicken sandwich
if I want.

18:53.032 --> 18:57.504
He's 28 years old, and
he can eat a chicken sandwich.
Very impressive.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.973
Mike Fitzgibbons's son
is a nuclear physicist,

19:01.040 --> 19:04.911
and my son can eat
a chicken--

19:07.314 --> 19:11.684
You can either eat
that goddamn roast beef
or you can go to bed.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.991
Good!

19:19.058 --> 19:22.094
Shh!
Gord! Gord!

19:22.161 --> 19:26.599
Don't hammer 'em so loud.
It's late. You're gonna
wake up your parents.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.902
You're right.
I should probably use
the electric nail gun.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.572
Yeah.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.607
Shh, Gord.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.209
Gord!
What?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.378
Oh, boys!

19:38.445 --> 19:43.350
Would you two faggots stop
making so fucking much noise?
We're sleeping!

19:46.253 --> 19:48.521
Goddamn it!

19:48.588 --> 19:51.458
Stop the fucking hammering!

19:51.524 --> 19:54.227
I got a kid over here.
Okay?

19:54.294 --> 19:58.865
- Gord, you guys almost done
over there?
- Yeah, nearly, Mr. Malloy.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.868
Hey, Gord, can I play
on your ramp tomorrow?

20:01.934 --> 20:05.171
Sure, Andy, anytime.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.516
Your dad got like
bowel problems?

20:16.583 --> 20:19.218
Let's skate this thing.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.522
Don't you think
it's kinda dark, Gord?

20:22.589 --> 20:25.558
I gotta work tomorrow.
You mean to say we've been
working on this thing for years.

20:25.625 --> 20:30.830
We're finished now and you're
not gonna try it out and enjoy
the fruits of your labor?

20:30.897 --> 20:33.733
I don't have the right shoes on.
They're slippery...

20:33.800 --> 20:37.537
and they got no sole.

20:37.604 --> 20:42.442
Just enjoy
the fruits here.
Don't say "the fruits."

20:44.611 --> 20:46.513
Okay.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.894
You little shit!
You think that's funny?

21:01.961 --> 21:05.565
I gotta work in the morning.
Get the hell off my property!

21:05.632 --> 21:07.600
Dad, what the fuck!
He hurt his leg!

21:07.667 --> 21:10.102
Why's everybody screaming
like a banshee?

21:10.169 --> 21:12.872
Oh... Jesus Christ.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.876
Oh, God!
Get him a job!

21:16.943 --> 21:21.280
I mean, get him
an ambulance!
You get a job!

21:25.685 --> 21:28.020
What the hell
are you doing?

21:34.927 --> 21:38.097
Hi, I'm lookin'
for my friend, Darren.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.767
Shh.

21:40.833 --> 21:44.771
Wow, that's a neat trick
you do.
Yeah.

21:44.837 --> 21:48.074
Yeah, my record's seven
in a row. Oh!

21:50.910 --> 21:54.614
Wow! Are hospitals
always this fun?
Yeah.

21:54.681 --> 21:59.352
No. Um, sometimes...
sometimes people here die
of cancer.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.221
Cancer.
Yeah.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.223
Hi, I'm Gord!

22:04.290 --> 22:07.093
Hi, I'm Betty.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.896
Uh...
that creamer game is fun.

22:09.962 --> 22:13.299
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, it's, um,
it's my hobby.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.702
Yeah, my passion
really is--
The creamers?

22:15.768 --> 22:19.639
No, not just the creamers.
Physics.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.575
Flight, actually.
I'm kind of...

22:22.642 --> 22:25.144
a rocket scientist.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.880
To tell the truth.
Yeah.

22:27.947 --> 22:32.385
Well, okay, amateur.
Amateur rocket scientist.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.388
Still pretty crazy.
Yeah, I know.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.490
W-What do you do?

22:37.557 --> 22:41.093
Me?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.496
Investments.
I do investments.

22:43.563 --> 22:47.600
Um, consulting
in the business business.

22:47.667 --> 22:51.871
Analyzing stocks.
Yeah.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.674
NASDAQ, Dow Jones,

22:54.741 --> 22:57.544
Wall Street Journal,
New York City.

22:57.610 --> 23:01.280
CNN.
You must be rich.

23:01.347 --> 23:05.985
Yeah. You know,
they have creamers in places
other than hospitals.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.221
I thought maybe--
If this is forward,
you just tell me.

23:09.288 --> 23:12.659
But I thought maybe we
could go to one of those places
like a restaurant or something.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.861
We could flip them
together there sometime.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.433
That'd be fun.
Here's my number.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.736
Okay, call me.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.738
Oh, gotta run.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.407
I'll talk to you soon.
Call me, Gord.

23:28.475 --> 23:31.310
Good-bye.

23:47.627 --> 23:51.130
Have you seen that girl
outside there, the doctor?

23:51.197 --> 23:54.867
No, I haven't exactly
been able to get up
and wander around, Gord.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.738
It's weird, 'cause I asked her
out on a date,
and, uh, she said "yes."

23:58.805 --> 24:01.173
- That is weird.
-  Excuse me.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.010
Could you keep it down?
This is a hospital room,
and I'm pregnant.

24:04.076 --> 24:07.313
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't realize
that you were pregnant.

24:07.379 --> 24:12.652
So, anyway, the girl when
I asked her on the date, see,
I thought she could walk.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.321
She's handicapped.
Is that what you mean?

24:15.387 --> 24:19.458
She's in a wheelchair.

24:19.526 --> 24:24.597
Could you please
just shut the fuck up!
I am fucking pregnant!

24:26.098 --> 24:29.902
So what do you say here?
You hate people
in wheelchairs?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.038
I don't hate people
in wheelchairs.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.774
It's crystal clear
what you're saying.
You hate the handicapped.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.476
You're handicapped.
I don't hate you.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.478
See?

24:39.546 --> 24:41.614
You're handicapped!

24:41.681 --> 24:45.885
My baby is coming.
You bastard!

24:51.758 --> 24:54.260
Help.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.395
Help!
My baby is coming!

24:56.462 --> 24:59.231
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

25:02.101 --> 25:05.037
**
Are you okay, ma'am?

25:05.104 --> 25:07.506
My baby's coming!
My baby is coming!

25:07.574 --> 25:09.542
Call the doctor,
you fucking asshole!

25:09.609 --> 25:11.744
It's okay, I'm a doctor.
No, no!

25:11.811 --> 25:14.714
Get me a real doctor.
I am a real doctor.

25:14.781 --> 25:17.617
I'm a real doctor.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.186
Get away from me!

25:22.922 --> 25:28.260
- Here, spread your legs for me.
- No, no!
What are you doing?

25:28.327 --> 25:30.797
What are you doing?

25:30.863 --> 25:33.299
I see the problem here.

25:33.365 --> 25:39.071
-There seems to be a little baby
inside your body!
-No, Gordy. Don't.

25:39.138 --> 25:44.076
Give me your hand,
little fellow.
Here, little fella.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.481
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.784
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

25:51.851 --> 25:55.221
Aah! Aah!

26:02.394 --> 26:04.096
Put it back, Gord.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.601
You gotta cut the cord.
You gotta... cut the cord.

26:08.668 --> 26:12.304
Geez, do I have
to do everything?

26:19.578 --> 26:23.616
Oh, oh, oh.
Why isn't it crying?

26:23.683 --> 26:27.053
Ah... it's sleepin'?

26:27.119 --> 26:29.421
Give me my baby,
you fucker!
I'll wake up your baby.

26:29.488 --> 26:32.458
- I'll wake up your baby!
- Gordy!

26:39.966 --> 26:42.334
The baby's crying!

26:59.518 --> 27:01.353
I saved the day.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.796
Thank you.

27:09.862 --> 27:13.833
I saved the day.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.037
I saved the day.

27:23.710 --> 27:27.079
Don't ever come back!
Ever!
I saved the day.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.116
You did not save the day!
What's goin' on, Gord?

27:30.182 --> 27:32.484
I saved the day.
Don't touch my shoulder, okay?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.520
I saved the day!

27:34.586 --> 27:38.357
It seems like they got a problem
with heroes around here.
I saved the day, Betty!

27:39.892 --> 27:42.294
I'll call you tonight.

27:51.070 --> 27:55.107
Hey, come on in.
Just got four in a row.

27:55.174 --> 27:59.345
What?
Creamers.
Four creamer flips in a row.
Here, come watch.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.547
Oh, cool.
Yeah.

28:01.613 --> 28:05.117
Whoo!
I got another one.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.988
No way.
Are those actually rockets?
Uh-huh.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.157
Yeah. I'm designing my own
rocket-powered wheelchair.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.326
Really?
That's incredible.
Does it work?

28:14.393 --> 28:17.997
No. I haven't been able
to quite figure it out yet.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.432
Don't you feel
like a stupid dummy?

28:21.567 --> 28:23.402
Excuse me?

28:23.469 --> 28:26.338
I mean, you tried to make
the rocket wheelchair work,
but it doesn't work.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.975
That must make you feel
like a stupid dummy, right?

28:29.041 --> 28:34.246
No. I didn't expect to master
the intricacies of rocketry
on my first attempt.

28:34.313 --> 28:38.584
It's a process, you know?
You have to learn
from your mistakes.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.453
Hmm. Never thought of it
like that.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.491
Besides, they won't let me
work on it at the hospital
because of the politics.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.228
They don't think handicapped
people should be allowed to go
that fast, but it's bullshit.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.864
I like going fast,
and I like rockets...

28:51.931 --> 28:56.836
because they're hot
and hard and long.

29:02.141 --> 29:06.345
Actually, I thought
we could kinda go
to a movie or somethin'.

29:07.346 --> 29:11.750
Uh, hi.
How are you?

29:11.818 --> 29:15.521
I'd be a lot better
if you'd spank my legs
with this bamboo.

29:15.587 --> 29:20.059
Um--
What?

29:20.126 --> 29:23.329
Just whack it against my shins
as hard as you can, okay?

29:23.395 --> 29:26.432
Uh, I guess.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.569
How's that?

29:30.636 --> 29:35.307
Come on, Gordy,
you can do better than that.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.577
What are you,
a little puss?
A puss?

29:38.644 --> 29:40.612
A pussy--
Come on!

29:40.679 --> 29:43.315
Come on, pussy,
you can do better.
A pussy. I don't know.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.817
Oh.
How's that?

29:44.884 --> 29:50.056
Come on, pussy, pussy!
Don't be shy, little pussy!

29:50.122 --> 29:52.691
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

29:52.758 --> 29:55.828
Oh, come on!
I wanna see them bleed!

29:57.596 --> 29:59.866
Oh, yeah!

30:03.836 --> 30:05.471
Oh, yeah!
I felt a tingle!

30:05.537 --> 30:08.174
You felt a tingle?
Did you like the tingle?

30:08.240 --> 30:11.243
Oh, yeah!

30:11.310 --> 30:12.912
Oh! Oh!

30:12.979 --> 30:15.147
Do you wanna get
another tingle?

30:15.214 --> 30:18.017
Ow!
Gord, what the fuck?

30:18.084 --> 30:20.086
Aah!
Not my face!

30:20.152 --> 30:23.389
It's not my face
that's paralyzed, you fuck!

30:26.392 --> 30:30.429
Ah--
Sorry, I--

30:31.730 --> 30:34.901
never really
caned anyone before.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.405
It's okay.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.874
It's your turn now.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.745
Don't do it too hard, though.
I've--

30:46.812 --> 30:49.515
I've got sensitive knees.

30:52.118 --> 30:55.754
Oh, I'm not gonna whack
your legs with a bamboo, Gord.

30:55.821 --> 30:59.158
I'm gonna give you
a blow job.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.827
Betty, it's only
our first date.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.563
Don't you think
we should go do
some romantic stuff first?

31:04.630 --> 31:07.799
Like take a walk
in the park?
No.
I can't walk.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.768
Maybe I could take you out
for a roll.

31:09.835 --> 31:12.704
I'd rather stay here
and suck!

31:12.771 --> 31:16.275
Good thing it's--

31:18.244 --> 31:20.512
Come here, Gord.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.121
Ah--

31:29.188 --> 31:30.589
Hmm.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.591
Um--

31:34.560 --> 31:36.362
That's my umbilical cord.

31:36.428 --> 31:40.899
Didn't you ever have that...
removed?

31:40.967 --> 31:45.771
Um, it's taped.
It's just for fun.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.207
I taped it there
for fun.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.776
Uh--
Hmm.

31:50.842 --> 31:53.345
Okay.
I can work around it.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.248
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Whoo!

31:56.315 --> 31:58.517
Come on!

31:58.584 --> 32:00.552
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.722
Okay.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.092
Whoo!

32:20.706 --> 32:25.377
Hello, Father.
Hey, Freddy!
How are you, son?

32:25.444 --> 32:29.348
You know, I'm, uh...
I'm working hard,
just like you taught me.

32:29.415 --> 32:33.019
You moving back home,
Freddy?
What? No. No, no!

32:33.085 --> 32:35.921
No way, Mother.
I'm a man now.

32:35.988 --> 32:40.192
I'm all grown up,
and I'm out on my own,
and earning a good living.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.194
Is it going to be a busy day
at the bank today, son?

32:42.261 --> 32:45.031
Well, I sure hope so.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.966
Freddy?
Is that, um--

32:48.034 --> 32:50.769
That's your big brother.

32:50.836 --> 32:53.772
He couldn't handle
the complexities
of making a cheese sandwich...

32:53.839 --> 32:56.408
so now he's back home
with us.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.944
Wow.
Is that idiot
still in the shower?

32:59.011 --> 33:00.946
Shit! How much water
is he gonna use?

33:01.013 --> 33:03.549
Yeah, how much is he
gonna use? All of it?

33:03.615 --> 33:06.518
He should save some
for the fish or somethin',
huh, Pop?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.400
Gord!

33:22.534 --> 33:24.870
I'll fix him.

33:24.936 --> 33:29.075
How's the water?
Cold enough for ya?

33:36.915 --> 33:40.519
Damn it. Don't tell me
you're so goddamn stupid...

33:40.586 --> 33:43.021
you can't even tell the
difference between hot and cold.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.291
What the fuck
is going on?

33:45.357 --> 33:48.394
I'm underwater.
Look, I found a treasure!

33:48.460 --> 33:50.496
A treasure?
That's soap on a rope.

33:50.562 --> 33:54.066
Shh. I'm pretending
it's a treasure.

33:54.133 --> 33:57.903
Get out of my goddamn
scuba gear, you imbecile!

33:57.969 --> 34:02.841
Oh, no, the treasure!
It went into
that underwater cave!

34:02.908 --> 34:05.043
Get out of the toilet!

34:05.111 --> 34:09.581
Get out of the--
Get out of the toilet!

34:09.648 --> 34:11.983
You saved me
from the giant barracuda!

34:12.050 --> 34:14.453
But, look, I salvaged
the treasure.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.190
We can live like kings.
We can live like kings!

34:18.257 --> 34:20.092
Forget that fucking soap.
You clean up this mess...

34:20.159 --> 34:24.496
and get your ass out that
door looking for a job,
you retard.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.304
He's driving me insane.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.474
No, no.
You're driving him insane.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.510
You're older than me,
and you still live at home.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.179
I have a job, you know.
I pay my own way.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.282
You work in a bank.
I'm supposed to be dazzled?

34:43.349 --> 34:45.917
At least
I don't live at home.

34:45.984 --> 34:49.688
You live in a tiny shithole
and can't afford breakfast, so
you come here and eat for free.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.091
Whatever. Listen,
I'm off to work now, okay?

34:53.159 --> 34:57.696
Me and Dad have jobs. We're
doing something with our lives.
It's time for you to grow up.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.900
Good luck with that job hunt.
Let's cross our fingers,
okay, Freddy?

35:01.967 --> 35:06.104
Let's cross our fingers
and hope that I get a job.
I'm serious.

35:06.172 --> 35:10.576
Just cross your fingers.
All right!
Fingers crossed!

35:10.642 --> 35:14.313
I hope I get a jobby,
Freddy!
I got my fingers crossed.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.315
I hope I get a jobby!
I got my...

35:16.382 --> 35:18.417
fingers crossed.
Good-bye, Gord.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.287
I got my fingers crossed.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.822
Crossed.
Crossed?

35:23.889 --> 35:26.425
Cro--

35:27.493 --> 35:29.261
--ssed.

35:46.945 --> 35:50.482
* Talk about that
personality crisis *

35:50.549 --> 35:52.751
* You got it while it was hot *

35:54.353 --> 35:58.290
* But now frustration
and heartache
is what you've got *

36:10.336 --> 36:12.671
Paid for his damn college.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.807
Sits at home all day
whacking off.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.510
Better have a damn job.

36:19.645 --> 36:23.749
Proud? My ass!

36:25.784 --> 36:28.186
Hey?
I'm the backwards man.
The backwards man.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.155
The backwards man.
The backwards man.

36:30.222 --> 36:33.825
I can walk backwards as fast
as you can. I can walk
backwards as fast as you can.

36:33.892 --> 36:37.463
I'm the backwards man.
The backwards man.
What the hell is that?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.765
The backwards man.
The backwards man.

36:39.831 --> 36:43.402
The backwards man.
The backwards man.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.638
I can walk backwards
as fast as you can.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.707
Gord!
Dad!

36:48.774 --> 36:52.110
What in God's name
are you doing,
you stupid little man?

36:52.177 --> 36:54.846
Wh--
Did you get a job?

36:56.382 --> 37:01.086
Yeah. I got a job,
and I wanted
to surprise you.

37:01.152 --> 37:04.956
Hey, you bullshittin' me,
boy?
No.

37:05.023 --> 37:08.327
I got a job working nights
at a computer company.

37:08.394 --> 37:11.062
And I was just borrowing
one of your suits until...

37:11.129 --> 37:14.966
I could get enough money
to buy one of my own.
You just keep that suit!

37:15.033 --> 37:19.805
Oh, Gord,
I knew you had it in ya.
You're just a late bloomer.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.707
Yeah, I just bloomed late.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.710
Hey, can I borrow 50 bucks?
You know, for supplies.

37:24.776 --> 37:29.114
For like pens
or Liquid Paper
or a Trapper Keeper.

37:29.180 --> 37:33.785
Or one of those compasses
that you put the pencil
and screw it in.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.921
Make a perfect circle.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.324
Hey, worker, take a hundred.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.827
Golly, Gord, I knew
if I kept yelling at ya...

37:41.893 --> 37:45.030
and pounding you
over the head with it,
you'd come around.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.634
Golly, Dad,
you were right all along.

37:48.700 --> 37:52.771
Ahh, you!
Come on, come on!

37:52.838 --> 37:54.973
No, no, no.

37:55.040 --> 37:59.378
Just keep dancing.
Celebrate!
Hell, this is a great day!

38:02.481 --> 38:06.518
The backwards man!
The backwards man!

38:06.585 --> 38:09.054
Oh, oh!

38:09.120 --> 38:12.324
Gordy, you're amazing!

38:12.391 --> 38:16.395
Oh, yes!
I'm doing a good job!

38:16.462 --> 38:19.831
I'm doing...
a good job.
Ohh!

38:23.869 --> 38:25.637
Am I doing it wrong?

38:25.704 --> 38:29.608
No!
That was incredible!

38:29.675 --> 38:32.811
Time for your blow job,
Gordy.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.313
Not right now, Betty.
Oh, Gordy, come on!

38:35.381 --> 38:38.116
I thought we could go
and enjoy a nice evening.
Don't you want me to suck it?

38:38.183 --> 38:42.220
No, not right--
Betty, let go.
Betty, just let go.

38:42.287 --> 38:45.223
What, Gordy?
Come on!
Betty!

38:45.290 --> 38:47.459
Betty, Betty, come on!
Let's--

38:47.526 --> 38:49.995
Stop it, stop it!
Stop it!
What?

38:52.230 --> 38:54.199
Why are you yelling?

38:54.265 --> 38:56.368
It's just crazy.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.137
This is the second date
that we haven't even
gone out on yet.

38:59.204 --> 39:04.275
If you do what you're planning,
then you'll have sucked 200%
more times that we've gone out.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.447
I think that if we went out
on at least one date,
and you didn't do any sucking,

39:08.514 --> 39:13.885
that would make the whole
sucking-to-date ratio
far more balanced.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.758
Yeah, okay.
Let's go out then.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.293
Good. Good.

39:39.611 --> 39:43.314
Thank you for taking me out
for dinner tonight.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.452
Maybe now that Gord
is working,

39:46.518 --> 39:49.755
we can finally spend
our evenings alone together.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.559
Jim,
what are you doing?

39:58.363 --> 40:01.800
Thank you.
That was yummy.
I'm so glad you liked it.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.870
Andy, would you like
a piece of cake
for dessert?

40:04.936 --> 40:07.706
Am I really allowed
a piece of cake, Daddy?

40:07.773 --> 40:10.742
Of course you can have
a piece of cake.
It's your birthday.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.545
Yea!
Yea!

40:23.354 --> 40:25.591
So, Gord,

40:25.657 --> 40:27.693
is your job really hard?

40:30.462 --> 40:32.464
It's not hard. No.
You have to be smart.

40:32.531 --> 40:36.502
You have to be really smart.
You have to use your brain.
I have to use my brain.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.638
I like to see
when the stocks are high.

40:39.705 --> 40:43.408
Okay? And I like to see
when, when they're low.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.410
That's the basics.
Sometimes they're high.
It's interesting.

40:45.477 --> 40:50.215
Sometimes they're very high.
They go very high.
That's high.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.317
That's when you wanna sell,
when they're very high.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.252
You buy them
when they're down very low.

40:54.319 --> 40:58.156
Yeah. I have graphs.
I have some graphs
I can show you.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.492
If you pay attention
to these patterns
you can see on the graphs--

41:00.559 --> 41:02.728
I made these
on my computer.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.764
Oh, boy, I need
to spill some urine.
Where can I do that?

41:05.831 --> 41:10.435
The restrooms are at the other
end of the restaurant, sir.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.771
Thank you very, very much.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.906
Cheerio.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.009
It's all over the place.
This one here
is the highs--

41:18.076 --> 41:20.979
It's interesting.
Just look at the patterns.

41:30.388 --> 41:34.325
Is that--
Do you need to--

41:34.392 --> 41:36.427
Oh!

41:36.494 --> 41:40.365
That's my...
cellular telephone.

41:40.431 --> 41:43.869
It's wireless.
It uses satellites
and terrestrial antennas...

41:43.935 --> 41:49.007
to send and receive
transmissions.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.242
Interesting.
Hello?

41:51.309 --> 41:54.746
Hey, here's my buddy, Andy!

41:54.813 --> 41:57.583
Ah, somebody's eating
some birthday cake.

41:57.649 --> 42:00.485
Yes, sir,
it's my birthday!

42:00.552 --> 42:02.921
How you doin', Jim?
I'm great.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.123
So, I guess Gord's busy
these days.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.893
Oh, yeah, that kid of mine
is somethin' else.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.829
He's working day and night
at his big new computer job.

42:10.896 --> 42:14.265
- Yeah, I noticed him
over there.
- Hey, what?

42:14.332 --> 42:16.968
It looked like he
was having a real important
business meeting.

42:17.035 --> 42:20.305
Yeah.
You're gonna have to speak up.
I'm on my cellular telephone.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.141
I don't care, you're fired.
You're fired!

42:23.208 --> 42:26.111
You're fucking fired, Bob!

42:26.177 --> 42:30.148
Clean out your locker
at the club, Bob.
You're fucking fired!

42:30.215 --> 42:32.684
I don't fucking care
what he told you, okay?

42:32.751 --> 42:36.588
I'm talking about 40 million
fucking deutsche marks!

42:36.655 --> 42:38.990
Forty million
fucking deutsche marks!

42:39.057 --> 42:42.828
I told you to wire the money
to Geneva last week!

42:42.894 --> 42:47.132
I say "Geneva,"
you hear "Helsinki"?

42:47.198 --> 42:51.703
Forty million
fucking deutsche marks!

42:52.938 --> 42:57.108
What's going on?
Dad-- Jim, uh--
Jim, hi.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.977
Gord, is this your dad?

42:59.044 --> 43:01.479
No, this is little Timmy--
Little Timmy.
He's an employee.

43:01.546 --> 43:04.582
He works at the company.
He gets us food and stuff.
Right, Timmy?

43:04.650 --> 43:06.652
What the fuck
is going on?

43:06.718 --> 43:09.788
Why aren't you at
your new job?

43:09.855 --> 43:12.190
What are you talking about,
Timmy?

43:12.257 --> 43:15.426
Oh, Jesus, Gord!

43:15.493 --> 43:18.864
There is no computer job,
is there?

43:18.930 --> 43:21.399
You're just gallivanting around
in my suit...

43:21.466 --> 43:24.535
pretending to be some kind
of mover and shaker,
aren't you?

43:24.602 --> 43:26.805
Timmy, I'm on
this phone here.

43:26.872 --> 43:29.841
This is my phone
from my kitchen.

43:29.908 --> 43:34.145
What the hell is this?
Ah, boy, here we go.

43:34.212 --> 43:37.849
My goddamn tape recorder.

43:37.916 --> 43:42.187
He's pretending to have a
cell phone. He's an unemployed
loser living in my basement.

43:44.155 --> 43:47.592
Wait a minute.
You're a cripple.

43:47.659 --> 43:50.228
Dad.
Wh-- What?

43:50.295 --> 43:52.530
- Dad.
- You got a problem
with my legs?

43:52.597 --> 43:55.600
No, you got a problem
with your legs. Either that
or you're just lazy.

43:55.667 --> 43:59.270
- Just shut up, okay?
Just shut up!
- You're telling me to shut up?

43:59.337 --> 44:01.572
Why is he shouting, Daddy?
How would Mr. Bigwig
like a spanking...

44:01.639 --> 44:03.474
Could we get the check
over here?

44:03.541 --> 44:06.778
- in front of his
retard slut whore?
- I am not retarded!

44:06.845 --> 44:10.381
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

44:10.448 --> 44:12.650
Good-bye, Gord.

44:12.718 --> 44:14.485
Betty, don't go!

44:14.552 --> 44:16.554
Shut up, Dad!

44:16.621 --> 44:18.656
Shut up! Shut up!

44:22.660 --> 44:24.996
This is a fancy restaurant!

44:25.063 --> 44:28.633
This is a fancy restaurant!
This is a fancy restaurant!

44:28.700 --> 44:32.170
It's a fancy!
It's a fancy!

44:32.237 --> 44:35.340
Spanking! Spanking!

44:39.510 --> 44:41.747
Aaah! Aaah!

44:44.382 --> 44:47.452
Oh, no! Oh, no!

44:50.221 --> 44:52.390
Get off the fucking bar,
asshole!

45:00.031 --> 45:02.934
Um, thanks for bailing me out,
Betty.

45:03.001 --> 45:06.204
Your dad called me
a retard slut whore.

45:06.271 --> 45:09.574
I don't think he likes me
too much, Gord.
That was little Timmy.

45:09.640 --> 45:14.312
Gord, come here.
I know it was your dad.

45:14.379 --> 45:17.582
You could've told me
you lived at home.
I wouldn't have cared.

45:17.648 --> 45:19.517
Even though that means
I'm a loser?

45:19.584 --> 45:23.554
Just because
you're not a stockbroker
doesn't mean you're a loser.

45:23.621 --> 45:25.891
So what do you do?

45:25.957 --> 45:27.959
Actually,
I kinda draw pictures.

45:28.026 --> 45:31.629
Really?
What kind of pictures?
Like... fruits?

45:31.696 --> 45:33.564
Not fruits.
Oh.

45:33.631 --> 45:38.303
I've drawn fruit before.
Animations.
Oh, wow! That's great.

45:38.369 --> 45:41.572
I've never really--
Never met
a real animator before.

45:41.639 --> 45:44.675
I'm not really a real animator.
Life's a little hectic lately.

45:44.742 --> 45:47.712
I'm having trouble concentrating
with all the skateboarding
and...

45:47.779 --> 45:50.615
you sucking my penis
all the time.

45:52.650 --> 45:57.889
Oh, my ear popped.
My ear just popped.
I think I heard it.

45:57.956 --> 46:00.091
When I laughed,
my ear popped.

46:00.158 --> 46:04.229
Well, Gordy, maybe
you're just concentrating
a little too hard.

46:04.295 --> 46:07.933
I mean, maybe you just need
to relax while you draw.

46:07.999 --> 46:11.669
Eat some food,
play some music.

46:11.736 --> 46:15.106
I only have two hands,
Betty. How am I supposed
to do all that?

46:15.173 --> 46:17.142
What?

46:17.208 --> 46:19.244
Eat food and play music
and draw?

46:19.310 --> 46:21.412
What?

46:21.479 --> 46:23.581
At the same time?

46:23.648 --> 46:27.252
Oh, yeah.

46:46.504 --> 46:50.141
* Sausages, sausages
sausages, sausages *

46:50.208 --> 46:54.512
What in the name of sweet
breakfast meats are you doing?

46:54.579 --> 46:57.515
For your information,
this is me being creative.

46:57.582 --> 47:00.451
Betty told me this is what
I need to do in order
to become an artist.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.487
Oh, yeah?
Is it working?

47:03.922 --> 47:06.024
I don't know.

47:06.091 --> 47:08.293
I can't think
of anything to draw
'cause I'm so stupid!

47:08.359 --> 47:10.261
* I'm so stupid
I'm so stupid *

47:10.328 --> 47:13.364
* I'm so stupid
I'm stupid, I'm stupid
I'm stupid, I'm stupid *

47:13.431 --> 47:17.168
* I'm stupid, I'm stupid *
This is kinda funny, Gord.

47:17.235 --> 47:20.371
* I'm stupid, I'm stupid *

47:20.438 --> 47:21.539
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.

47:21.606 --> 47:24.709
Maybe you can't see it
'cause he's your dad,
but...

47:24.775 --> 47:26.711
he's a character,
your dad.

47:26.777 --> 47:28.813
He is?

47:28.880 --> 47:30.848
Yeah.

47:30.916 --> 47:33.518
He's a character?
Shit!
It's your dad!

47:33.584 --> 47:38.189
* He's a real character *
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

47:38.256 --> 47:43.895
Oh, look, honey,
our boy's a genius!

47:43.962 --> 47:48.466
He's rigged a pulley system
so he can eat sausage
and work on his stupid drawings.

47:48.533 --> 47:51.236
I'm being creative.

47:51.302 --> 47:54.272
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I still have
some work to do.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.707
* Daddy, would you like
some sausage *

47:56.774 --> 48:00.678
* Daddy would you like
some sausages, Daddy would
you like some sausage *

48:00.745 --> 48:03.248
* Sausages, sausages *

48:03.314 --> 48:06.317
Aah! Aah!

48:10.989 --> 48:13.458
Now you just get outside
and you just cool off!

48:15.026 --> 48:18.596
If this were Pakistan,
you would've been sewing
soccer balls...

48:18.663 --> 48:21.933
when you were four years old.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.103
Miserable deadbeat punk!

48:25.170 --> 48:27.338
I bust my ass
working for my family.

48:27.405 --> 48:30.441
You take his side
every time.

48:30.508 --> 48:34.279
You want me to cool out?
I'm gonna show you
a cool out.

48:34.345 --> 48:38.249
Go on,
just keep kissing his ass.

48:38.316 --> 48:41.019
Cool down.

48:41.086 --> 48:43.388
How's this
for cool down?

48:48.859 --> 48:51.329
I feel better already.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.702
Aaah!

49:08.713 --> 49:12.050
Whoa!

49:14.185 --> 49:17.122
My ramp.
Why?

49:20.391 --> 49:23.228
He's such a stupid loser.
He's not stupid.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.031
We shouldn't put up
with the way he treats us.

49:26.097 --> 49:28.166
If I were you,
I wouldn't stand for it.

49:28.233 --> 49:31.436
If I were you, I would show him
that I deserve respect.

49:31.502 --> 49:35.440
If I were you, I would go out,
I'd have sex.
Honey, no.

49:35.506 --> 49:40.211
If I were you, I'd go out,
I'd have sex with a strange man.

49:40.278 --> 49:43.148
I'd have sex with
basketball players, with Greeks.

49:43.214 --> 49:46.551
Men from Greece.

49:46.617 --> 49:48.719
And satisfy my urges!

49:48.786 --> 49:51.522
I'd satisfy my sexual desires!

49:51.589 --> 49:54.192
Gordy, honey, come on,
let's go in the house.

49:56.861 --> 49:58.929
Come on.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.133
That's my ramp.
I know.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.437
He wrecked my ramp.
I know.
It's okay.

50:06.504 --> 50:09.974
I'm sorry. Come on.

50:10.041 --> 50:14.312
When I had the sausages
on my fingers, I was
just trying to play the piano.

50:14.379 --> 50:18.616
I had the sausages.
I had the sausages
and the string.

50:18.683 --> 50:23.154
I was playing the organ.
And then he smashed
my half-pipe.

50:23.221 --> 50:25.890
Jim, do you hear
what Gord is saying here?

50:25.956 --> 50:29.760
Yeah, I hear him boo-hooing
about his broken
wheelie-board ramp.

50:29.827 --> 50:33.864
Is that what you mean?
Yes, Jim, but do you understand
what he's saying?

50:33.931 --> 50:36.801
Sounds to me like he just
wants you to accept him
as your son.

50:36.867 --> 50:41.005
To approve of him in what
he wants to do with his life.

50:41.072 --> 50:42.940
Now, how does that
make you feel?

50:43.007 --> 50:45.976
First, I don't give
a rat's ass what this
snot-nosed punk wants.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.947
As long as he lives
in my house and eats
my food, I make the rules.

50:50.014 --> 50:51.982
I wanna eat chicken burgers!

50:52.049 --> 50:56.087
You little prick.
Jim, don't hurt my baby.
Now sit down.

50:56.154 --> 50:58.456
You're an embarrassment
to my family.

51:01.592 --> 51:04.929
Oh, yeah? Well, at least
I don't touch Freddy.

51:04.995 --> 51:07.565
- Hey, what?
- Excuse me?

51:07.632 --> 51:10.135
Yeah, he touches
my little brother.

51:10.201 --> 51:13.738
He takes him down
behind the furnace, and
he touches him in his pants.

51:13.804 --> 51:16.541
See the insanity
I have to put up with?
He's embarrassed.

51:16.607 --> 51:21.112
He touches
my little brother. He--

51:21.179 --> 51:23.681
He, he fingers him.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.217
You're a goddamn liar!

51:26.284 --> 51:30.188
Jim, do you touch him?
Do you finger our boy?

51:30.255 --> 51:33.324
Don't you get wacky on me.
What the fuck
are we talkin' about here?

51:33.391 --> 51:35.693
Mr. Brody,
this is very serious.

51:35.760 --> 51:40.265
Based on what I've heard here,
I am required by law
to notify the authorities.

51:40.331 --> 51:43.534
Do you hear that, Dad?
You're gonna pay!

51:43.601 --> 51:45.403
He's a molester.

51:45.470 --> 51:48.506
He's a child... molester!

51:48.573 --> 51:50.208
Aaah!

51:51.876 --> 51:53.544
Aaah! Aaah!

51:54.645 --> 51:57.615
You better run!

51:57.682 --> 51:59.484
You liar!

52:01.686 --> 52:05.523
Then we placed
a self-retaining retractor.

52:05.590 --> 52:08.159
This holds the abdominal
wall open so we can have--

52:14.365 --> 52:19.204
That takes us to the area
of the lymph nodes.

52:26.844 --> 52:28.679
Hi.
Can I help you?

52:28.746 --> 52:32.750
Yes, you can.
We're here for little Freddy.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.652
I'm Freddy.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.088
No.

52:38.155 --> 52:41.659
Well, um, Freddy,

52:41.726 --> 52:45.630
I'm a doctor,
and we need to take you
with us.

52:45.696 --> 52:48.233
What?

52:48.299 --> 52:50.401
What did I do wrong?

52:50.468 --> 52:52.870
No, no, you didn't do
anything wrong.

52:52.937 --> 52:56.173
That's the most important thing
for you to remember.

52:56.241 --> 53:00.044
It's not your fault
your dad fingered you.

53:00.110 --> 53:03.381
What are you
talking about?
My dad doesn't finger me.

53:03.448 --> 53:05.483
Come on, son.
We'll take you outta here.
No!

53:05.550 --> 53:09.186
No, I'm not going anywhere.
My father
does not finger me.

53:09.254 --> 53:11.856
It's over, Freddy.

53:11.922 --> 53:16.427
We'll take you someplace
where your dad won't be able
to hurt you anymore.

53:16.494 --> 53:19.230
Officer.
Come with me, son.

53:19.297 --> 53:22.467
My dad doesn't finger--
Are you crazy?

53:22.533 --> 53:25.903
It's okay, Freddy.
You'll be safe now.
I'm 25 years old!

53:28.739 --> 53:31.609
Dad? Dad!

53:31.676 --> 53:35.179
Dad? Help. Please help.
What are you doin'
with my boy?

53:35.246 --> 53:37.848
I'll get you a lawyer.
Freddy, no!

53:39.717 --> 53:43.153
Bye, Fred.
It's okay, Julie.

53:43.220 --> 53:47.224
Your husband's deeply disturbed,
and we won't let him hurt
your little boy anymore.

53:48.793 --> 53:50.895
I didn't do anything.

53:53.097 --> 53:56.734
What are you lookin' at?
Bitch.

53:56.801 --> 53:59.370
Honey! Julie!

54:18.856 --> 54:21.091
- What do you think
you're doing?
- Stop it, Dad.

54:21.158 --> 54:23.227
I'm working hard on those.
I'm gettin' em ready
to show Mr. Davidson.

54:23.294 --> 54:25.229
Stop it.

54:27.332 --> 54:30.401
"Oh, stop it.
Stop it."

54:32.537 --> 54:35.706
"Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it."

54:35.773 --> 54:37.742
Fuck you, Dad.

54:41.111 --> 54:43.514
Fuck me?

54:43.581 --> 54:46.484
Yeah, fuck you.

54:46.551 --> 54:49.219
Do you wanna fuck me?
Is that what you said?

54:49.286 --> 54:51.288
What?

54:51.356 --> 54:54.258
Do you want to fuck me?

54:54.325 --> 54:58.228
Huh?
All right, Gord.

54:58.295 --> 55:03.267
Come on over here...
and fuck me.

55:03.334 --> 55:06.103
Come on, Gord!
Dance over here and fuck me!

55:06.170 --> 55:08.973
Just stick it right in here!

55:09.039 --> 55:11.409
Put your ass away.
I don't--

55:11.476 --> 55:13.978
Here.
Your sketches here--

55:14.044 --> 55:16.814
Holy shit, Dad.
What are you doing?

55:16.881 --> 55:20.317
Why don't you come on over here
and fuck your daddy?

55:20.385 --> 55:23.253
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!
-  Here we go!

55:23.320 --> 55:26.791
- Hey!
-  That's disgusting.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.534
Julie?

55:40.805 --> 55:43.541
Sweetie?

55:48.212 --> 55:50.347
Hey.

55:50.415 --> 55:54.519
You're gone, Brody.
You're nothing.

55:54.585 --> 55:58.222
- You've always been nothing,
and you'll always be nothing.
- Dad--

55:58.288 --> 56:02.026
God!
I've never been so ashamed
of anything in my life.

56:02.092 --> 56:05.229
Julie!
Dad.

56:05.295 --> 56:08.399
Sweetie!

56:08.466 --> 56:12.937
* Don't nobody know
my troubles but God *

56:13.003 --> 56:17.442
* Ooh, Lordy
I got troubles so hard *

56:17.508 --> 56:21.879
* Ooh, Lordy
I got troubles so hard *

56:21.946 --> 56:26.383
* Don't nobody know
my troubles but God *

56:26.451 --> 56:30.688
* Don't nobody know
my troubles but God *

56:49.039 --> 56:54.311
* Ooh, Lordy
I got troubles so hard **

56:54.378 --> 56:57.848
Ah, shit.

57:02.853 --> 57:05.890
The hypergolic propeller's
not mixing.

57:17.835 --> 57:20.705
Of course.
It's the oxidizer.

57:20.771 --> 57:24.408
Too bad it didn't work, huh?
Oh, hey, Gord.

57:24.475 --> 57:26.443
How are the animations
coming along?

57:26.511 --> 57:28.879
Well, see,

57:28.946 --> 57:31.215
there's been
a change in plans.

57:31.281 --> 57:34.919
I figured instead of following
my dream of being an animator,
I'm just gonna give up.

57:36.186 --> 57:39.557
Why?
Because.

57:39.624 --> 57:41.792
Because why?
'Cause why shouldn't I?

57:41.859 --> 57:44.895
My dad was right all along.
It is stupid.

57:44.962 --> 57:47.965
It's time I grow up
and get a job
and do something with my life...

57:48.032 --> 57:50.200
instead of acting like
a little baby all the time.

57:51.802 --> 57:54.171
But Gord, you're not
a little baby.
You can't just quit.

57:54.238 --> 57:56.607
Shut up, Betty.
Just shut up.

57:56.674 --> 57:59.009
I have about as much a chance
of being an animator...

57:59.076 --> 58:02.146
as you have of getting
this stupid rocket-powered
wheelchair to work.

58:02.212 --> 58:04.615
Can't you see we're both just
a couple of stupid idiots?

58:04.682 --> 58:06.951
Gord--
"Gord!"

58:07.017 --> 58:09.620
"Gordy!"

58:11.689 --> 58:13.824
Gord, I'm so close
to getting this rocket
to work.

58:13.891 --> 58:16.994
"Rockets! Rockets!
I'm gonna get
my rockets to work!"

58:17.061 --> 58:20.264
It's always about the rockets!
It's always about the rockets!

58:37.848 --> 58:39.717
* Girls and boys
come out to play *

58:39.784 --> 58:41.886
* The moon is showing
a gorgeous day *

58:56.200 --> 58:58.035
You got fingered?

58:59.536 --> 59:01.572
No. Okay?

59:03.708 --> 59:07.544
It's okay.
I know.

59:10.615 --> 59:12.583
Now, I'll tell you
once more.

59:12.650 --> 59:15.720
Stop trying to act
so grown-up.

59:15.786 --> 59:17.722
I think I'd better
run along, Wally.

59:26.831 --> 59:29.667
Is there a problem?
Yeah, moron.

59:29.734 --> 59:33.103
I ordered a cheese sandwich,
and there's hardly
any cheese in here.

59:33.170 --> 59:35.740
That's no good, is it?

59:35.806 --> 59:38.042
Here, give me your sandwich.
I will fix it for you.

59:41.345 --> 59:43.447
We can't have
people complaining that
there's not enough cheese...

59:43.513 --> 59:45.616
in the cheese sandwiches,
now, can we?

59:45.683 --> 59:47.952
I mean, if there's no cheese
in a cheese sandwich,

59:48.018 --> 59:50.020
it's basically just
two slices of bread!

59:50.087 --> 59:54.491
If word of that
were to get out,
I could lose my job!

59:54.558 --> 59:57.061
I could lose all of this!

59:57.127 --> 59:59.196
And we wouldn't want that,
now, would we?

59:59.263 --> 01:00:02.332
Would we?
Would we?

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.301
Huh?

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:09.707
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with that?

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:11.876
Well, you could stick it
in your bum-bum.

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:16.947
You could put the cheese
in your bum.

01:00:18.783 --> 01:00:20.718
You can just go on upstairs
to your room.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:22.619
Okay, if that's
what you want.

01:00:22.687 --> 01:00:25.422
Julie!

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:27.725
Sweetheart, wait!

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:29.727
Let's talk, sugar.

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:34.031
There's nothing to talk about.
I can't be with you
another second.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:37.101
Hey, what about
our dreams, baby doll?

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:40.237
Oh, I'm sure you'd rather find
some young boys
instead of me.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.207
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.976
I saw what
you were doing downstairs!

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:48.645
Whatever you saw was
completely out of context!

01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:52.216
I just told him to fuck me
because Gord said,
"Fuck you, Dad."

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:54.151
Don't you get it?
Fuck you? Fuck me?

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:57.021
Fuck you. Fuck me.
Fuck you. Fuck me.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:03.593
And I never
fingered Freddy!

01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:14.138
Andy.
Andy, Andy.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.619
Here's one
for the history books.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.655
We've all heard of
electric wheelchairs,

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:33.758
but have you heard of one
powered by rockets?

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:35.659
A local girl
by the name of Betty Manger...

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:38.796
may not be able to walk,
but it certainly hasn't
slowed her down any.

01:01:38.863 --> 01:01:41.531
She's an amateur
rocket scientist...

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:45.502
who designed a wheelchair
that does zero to sixty
in under four seconds.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.972
She did it.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:55.913
Look at her go!

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:01.752
Way to go, Betty.

01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:03.921
Yeah, hi.

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:08.192
Um, do you think that I pay you
to stand around watching TV?

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:11.728
Get back to work.
Sorry, kid, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:13.730
Don't call me kid, okay?

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:17.534
Sir, although I respect
your authority here
at Submarine Supreme...

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:20.037
and I admire
your position of power,

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:24.674
I regretfully am going
to have to once again bow out
of the sandwich industry.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:28.913
Because in reality,
I am an animator!

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:31.081
I'm an animator!

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:33.050
Okay?

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.221
I, um--
I have some fetishes.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.389
See ya.

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:43.093
Where the hell do you think
you're goin', Gordy?
I'm going to get a job, Dad.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.930
You must think
I'm a damn idiot!
Uh, yes.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.065
Bullshit,
you're getting a job!

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.700
You're a liar!
You're grounded, you liar!

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.669
Grounded?
I'm 28 years old.

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:55.405
- I don't care!
Go to your room!
- Bye-bye, Daddy.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:58.142
Bye-bye, Daddy.
I'm going to get a jobby!

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:01.478
No, not-- not in this
damn car, you're not!

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:05.115
Bye-bye, Daddy!
I'm your number-one son!
Fuck you!

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.556
Where the fuck is he?
Mr. Brody?

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.524
Where's my son?
What?

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:16.460
Where is he?

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.996
Mr. Brody, please!
I don't know!

01:03:19.063 --> 01:03:22.332
Aah!
Are you gonna tell me,
you little punk?

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:29.306
He's in Hollywood
selling his cartoons.
Oh, yeah?

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:49.927
Japan Four!

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:53.898
Okay, Davidson for four
at 3:00--

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:59.069
Mr. Davidson, I have
something you need to see.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:02.272
Is there a bomb
in there, Gord?
It's not a bomb!

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.475
I did what you told me
to do, okay?
I quit my shitty cheese job.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.811
I went home.
I moved in with my parents.
I worked really hard.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:10.780
I came up
with a concept.
Mm-hmm.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.017
It's called
"Zebras in America."
Okay?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.953
It's about a family of zebras.
They move to America.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.955
It's a classic
"fish out of water" story.

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:20.958
Except it's not fish.
It's, uh, zebras...

01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:23.160
out of water.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.362
Of course, zebras
don't live in water, Gord,
but I understand.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.564
I know.
I know. Exactly.
Who cares?

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:29.599
That's what I'm talking about.
The zebras aren't in the water.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:32.202
It's like Splash.
It's like Splash.
I saw it. I loved it.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:35.805
But I have a question for you.
Is this the father character
with the goatee like you?

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.874
Is that him?
Y-Y-Yeah.

01:04:37.942 --> 01:04:39.944
Just seems a little
unrealistic, that's all.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.979
It's unrealistic.
Yeah.
It's unreal--

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:44.281
He's a centaur.
He's like a half-man,

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:46.450
half-zebra.
Right.
Clash of the Titans.

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:49.686
- Right. Sure. I get it.
- Half-man, half-zebra mutant.

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:52.122
He's a-- He's a--
He's a myth.
He's a myth.

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:54.158
It's a mythological--
It's like a Greek myth.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.961
It's like a Greek myth,
except African.
Sure.

01:04:57.027 --> 01:05:01.031
- African-American
Greek myth. Yes.
- Myth.

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:07.137
Can I help you?
Yeah, you can help me, bitch.

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.273
Get off your fat ass and tell me
where my fucking son is.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.308
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.477
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.316
But the father is real.
No.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:22.219
Nobody does this shit.
I don't buy it.
It doesn't seem--

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:25.622
Ahh! Here you are,
you goddamn lying car thief!

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:33.030
What's so fuckin' funny,
you little prick?

01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:34.965
You're fuckin' funny.
You think that it's funny...

01:05:35.032 --> 01:05:39.303
to brainwash my kid
so he sits around with
his fingers up his ass?

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:42.706
- I'll show you what's funny!
- Mr. Davidson, run!

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:46.276
Oh, don't hurt me, big daddy!
Oh, don't hurt me!
I'll kick your ass!

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:49.179
Oh, yeah!
Don't mess with my son!

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:53.583
I'm the father here!
I'll get you!

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:56.953
I'll get you, Gord,
you son of a bitch!
You too, you little prick!

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:59.589
Ow! That hurt!
Hey!

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:03.327
Ow! Goddamn!
Great job! Nice show!

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.395
Where'd you get this guy?
Central Casting?

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.032
He is fucking great.
I love the whole bit.
It was hilarious, Gord.

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:10.400
That's great shit.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.237
Mr. Davidson, I'm sorry.
That's my father.
He's crazy.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:16.273
Gord, whatever.
Listen, do me a favor.
Stop the act, okay?

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.375
Let me tell you something.

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:21.445
I've been doing this job, okay,
for six years.

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.081
I have never seen
a more creative
or exciting pitch than that.

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:26.750
I wasn't even thinking
about writing a check today.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.053
But with that kind
of creativity,

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:32.222
I'm completely comfortable
green-lighting
this fucking project.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.691
I'm gonna write you a check
right now, partner,

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:38.495
for, I don't know,
how's one million dollars
sound to you?

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.866
Oh. Uh--
Sound good?

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.734
Sounds real--

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.239
Hi. My name is Harry.

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:52.309
Do you hear the funny sound?
Do you hear the funny sound?

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.112
It's my hooves!
It's my hooves!

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:59.216
In Africa,
the humans hated us because
of our zebra lower bodies,

01:06:59.283 --> 01:07:01.751
and the zebras hated us because
of our human upper bodies.

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:04.721
So my family,
we moved from Africa
to start over in America.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:10.494
But life in America
wasn't perfect.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.264
Especially for zebras who were
used to living in fields,
not houses.

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:18.635
My hooves! My hooves!

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:23.407
My dad was weird in Africa,
but America made him crazy.

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:25.642
I'm not gettin'
a stupid job, Dad!

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.744
I never had
a part-time job in Africa.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:29.613
How dare you!

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:36.953
How do you like that, fucker?
Huh, fucker?
How do you like that, fucker?

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.189
Huh, fucker?
You fucker!

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:42.159
You fucker!
Eh, fucker?
Fucker! Fucker!

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:45.395
So check us out.
You'll laugh at how
simple misunderstandings...

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:48.132
always seem to get us into
a whole heap of trouble.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:51.067
It's crazy!
Listen to my hooves!

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:53.970
Listen to my hooves!

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:56.506
Listen to them
cloppity-clop.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.475
Listen to them
cloppity-clop.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:01.745
Zebras in America!

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:24.401
Darren! Darren!

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.037
Darren.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:32.509
What do you want, Gord?
Darren, you're not
gonna believe this.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:34.877
I don't think
we can be friends anymore,

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.846
because you're crazy
and your father's crazy too.

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:40.149
You wanna see what
a million dollars looks like?
Will you keep it down?

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.085
I have to work in--

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:46.456
What the hell is that?
It's a check
for a million dollars.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:49.259
I sold my cartoon.
My dad said
I couldn't sell my cartoon.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:52.095
But guess what?
I sold my cartoon...

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:54.564
for a million dollars!

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.367
- Shh!
- I got a million dollars
for my little drawings!

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:59.435
No, no, no.
For my little drawings!

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:02.805
Don't rub on Mr. Lee.
No, no, no, no.
Not my plant.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:06.443
Give me my plant, Gord.
Gord, give--

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.345
Don't you see?
I don't have to take
his crap anymore.

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:13.983
You're right.
You've done it.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:16.118
You don't even have to live
in their basement anymore.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:20.890
Look, just give me $100,000
in cash, put the rest
in my checking/savings account.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:25.261
What do you want
with 100 grand, Gord?

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:28.198
Hmm!
Hmm!

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.300
Hmm!
No.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:32.902
- Don't--
Don't do that.
- I wonder!

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:35.538
I wonder!
I wonder!

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:53.189
Betty! Betty,
come to the window!

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:56.493
Betty! Betty!

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.963
Gord?
Gord, is that you?

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.832
Look at me, Betty!
I'm flying!

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:11.641
- Gord, what do you want?
- Meet me on the roof!

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:15.812
Meet me on the roof,
Betty, please!

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:29.526
* When a man loves a woman *

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:34.030
* Can't keep his mind
on nothin' else *

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:39.303
* He'd trade the world
for a good thing he's found *

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:44.408
* If she is bad
he can't see it *

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:47.143
* She can do no wrong *
Gord, what are you doing?

01:10:49.313 --> 01:10:51.415
* Turn his back
on his best friend *

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:53.450
* If he put her down *
What?

01:10:53.517 --> 01:10:55.452
I saw you on TV--

01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:58.522
* When a man loves a woman *

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.590
Gord, I can't hear you!

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:04.328
I saw you on TV,
and you inspired me
to keep trying.

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:08.031
So I did it,
and I sold my animations and--

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:13.637
Remember that day
I lied to you and told you
that I was a stockbroker?

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.740
Guess what?
Now I really am rich, and--
Here.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.977
I have a bag
of jewels for you.
Gord.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:25.549
- Gord--
- They're jewels, Betty.
They're jewels.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:28.485
I got them all for you.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:31.921
But Gord,
I don't care about jewels.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:35.959
I just wanna--
I just wanna suck your cock.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.863
Do you-- Do you
really mean that, Betty?

01:11:41.365 --> 01:11:43.600
Yes, Gord.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:46.903
Even if you were poor,
I'd still just wanna
stay home and--

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:52.008
and suck your cock.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:55.812
* When a man *
Oh, Betty.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:59.449
* Loves a woman *
Oh, Gordy.

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:02.118
* Down deep in his soul *

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:04.688
* She can bring him *

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:09.926
Are you crying, you silly?
No! No!

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.997
Yes, you are.
Okay, maybe just a little.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:18.568
I gotta go!
I gotta go!

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:20.637
Okay. But where
are you going, Gord?

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:24.741
I'm going to see my daddy!

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.511
* When a man loves a woman *
Good luck, Gord!
Good luck!

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:32.215
I'm going to see my daddy!

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.184
Good luck, Gordy!

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.887
My daddy!
My daddy!

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:51.561
Somebody
in this room?

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:55.064
I'll kick your ass.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:04.007
Fuck.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:08.211
Sweet dreams, Daddy.

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:18.922
You see, Mr. Brody?
This part here,
that's the trickiest part.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.757
It'll take 30 men.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:24.594
Believe me, it would be
a lot cheaper if you just
tear the whole thing down and--

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:26.663
Money's no object.

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.732
'Cause I had
a million dollars, okay?

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.334
And then I spent $150,000
on the jewels, okay?

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.938
And then I spent $100,000--
I rented a helicopter, okay?

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:37.574
And then you add this $750,000,
that's all my money.

01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:41.811
That's all my money, gone.
It's a million dollars gone.

01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:44.514
Easy come, easy go.
Yeah.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.650
I tell ya.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:57.861
Oh, yeah, Frida.
That's the ticket.

01:15:16.913 --> 01:15:19.983
Where in the fuck's
that water?

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:41.370
Surprise, Daddy!
We're in Pakistan!

01:15:41.437 --> 01:15:44.574
I thought we could go
sew some soccer balls together!

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:47.310
Pakistan?
Pakistan?

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.713
That's a fuckin' camel!

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:52.616
We're going
for a ride, Daddy!

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:58.087
What is going on?

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:03.126
What is going on?
Why the hell
did you do this to me?

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.932
- Oh, no!
- Stop! Stop!

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.846
Dad, uh--

01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:34.590
There ain't gonna be
no discussion from now on!

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:37.193
I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.195
I'm gonna kill you!

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:41.330
Hey!
Hey, hey!

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:44.634
You're fuckin' dead.

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:52.642
Oh, God.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:56.980
You didn't know
I could run this fast,
did you, fuck-face? Hey!

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.248
You better run,
you little shit!

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:06.322
Look at me, Daddy!

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:09.458
Oh! Look at me!

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:11.661
Look at me, Daddy!
Look what I can do!

01:17:11.728 --> 01:17:15.431
What the fuck
do you think you're doing,
you sick son of a bitch?

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:17.333
Look! Oh!

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:31.247
Dad?

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.256
Oh!

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.028
Gord.
Are you okay?

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:46.963
I think so.

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:51.000
Shit.

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:53.002
I wanna ask you something,
all right?

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:56.539
How the fuck
did you afford all this?

01:17:56.605 --> 01:17:58.407
Where'd you get the money?

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:02.278
I got a job.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:06.515
I'm an animator.
I'm a real animator.

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:10.319
A job?
You mean your doodles?

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:13.957
Yeah, Dad.
I sold them.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:17.260
They gave me a million dollars
for my drawings.

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:22.465
Good God Almighty, Gord!
A million dollars?

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.433
This doodlin' thing's
for real.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:29.238
Yeah, you must be
a pretty damn good doodler,
aren't you?

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:33.542
Look, I know
we've had our differences.

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:37.013
You and I never
really see eye to eye,
but I learned something.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.548
I could see that.
No.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.384
Not just how to
whack off an elephant.

01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:45.955
I learned to believe
in myself.

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:48.792
And I'm sorry if you're
ashamed of me sometimes...

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:52.728
because I do things
a little differently,
but I got that from you.

01:18:52.796 --> 01:18:57.633
'Cause you always do things
your own way, no matter
what other people think.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.736
Maybe I needed
to do the same.

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:06.209
I know I'll never be
the man you want me to be,

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:08.111
but I'm your son.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.281
And I want you
to be proud.

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:21.991
Son, you did it.

01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:26.029
I am proud of you.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:29.198
Proud?

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.267
Proud.

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.202
What is this?

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.285
Topping world news tonight:

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.287
The creator of a popular
television show...

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:54.223
has been captured
by villagers in Pakistan.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.460
The American State Department
has confirmed that
Gordon Brody,

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:00.596
creator of the animated series
Zebras in America--

01:20:00.663 --> 01:20:03.532
...creator of the animated
series Zebras in America--

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:06.836
...were taken hostage
earlier today while vacationing
in the Thar Desert--

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:11.040
...while vacationing
in the Thar Desert along
the Pakistan-India border.

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:14.077
At this hour,
their conditions are not known.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:35.398
The world got its first glimpse
of Gordon and Jim Brody.

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:38.467
Earlier today, the Pentagon
released this videotape...

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:41.037
which they received
from the captors.
Why are we watching this?

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:43.306
Are you still in love
with your husband?
No, Shaq, honey.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:46.842
That's my son--
my little baby boy.
They're holding him hostage.

01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:49.712
- I'm just being
a concerned mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.814
I did all this for you--
nipples pierced.

01:20:51.881 --> 01:20:53.716
Can he do it like this?
Huh?

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:56.819
Can he do it like that?
Or do all this?
Do all that?

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:59.923
...to bring the Brody's
home alive.

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:02.658
A happy ending in
the Brody hostage crisis.

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:06.930
After 18 months in captivity,
the father and son
were freed yesterday.

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:10.934
Gordon and Jim Brody
were expected to return to
their home in Portland today...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.536
where the real healing
will begin.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:17.573
The mayor and the city
have organized a celebration
for the Brodys' return.

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:38.061
Hey, Gord!

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.765
Wait for me!
Andy, no!

01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:19.068
Andy!

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.270
No!

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:25.408
Daddy!
I'm okay! I'm okay!

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:28.244
I'm okay, Daddy!

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:30.713
May I have your attention,
please?

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.916
May I have your attention,
please?

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:37.386
Will the real Slim Shady
please stand up?

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:41.390
I repeat: Will the real
Slim Shady please stand up?

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.492
We're gonna have
a problem here.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:45.728
* Y'all act like you never seen
a white person before *

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.397
* Jaws all on the floor
like Pam, like Tommy
just burst in the door *

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:52.301
**
You can't hurt me,
not with my cheese helmet!

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:55.538
He's a stupid--
He's a stupid--
Not stupid.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:58.141
He's stupid!
He's stupid!
Not stupid. Not stupid.

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:01.144
Ooh! Now I'm stinky!

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:05.448
Now I'm stinky!
Now-- Now I'm stinky!

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:07.483
It's a monster!
What the hell
are you doin'?

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:10.453
You're a tasty monster.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.824
Uh-oh!
Oh! Oh!

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:54.230
Get up off your ass!

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.367
What the fuck am I doing?

01:23:58.434 --> 01:24:01.537
* Yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys
are just imitating *

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:04.173
* So won't the real Slim Shady
please stand up *

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.409
* Please stand up
Please stand up *

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:10.813
I guess there's a Slim Shady
in all of us.

01:24:14.617 --> 01:24:17.353
Let's all stand up.

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:42.511
One, two!
Do the Freddy!

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.880
* Do the Freddy, do the Freddy
Do the Freddy, do the Freddy *

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:49.718
* Do the Freddy, do the Freddy
Do the Freddy, do the Freddy *

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.841
* Whether I'm right *

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:15.444
* Or whether I'm wrong *

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:18.013
* Whether I find
a place in this world *

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.149
* Or never belong *

01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:22.751
* I've gotta be me *

01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:25.288
* I've gotta be me *

01:25:25.354 --> 01:25:30.125
* What else can I be
but what I am *

01:25:30.193 --> 01:25:32.961
* I wanna live *

01:25:33.028 --> 01:25:35.631
* Not merely survive *

01:25:35.698 --> 01:25:38.267
* And I won't give up
this dream of life *

01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:40.436
* That keeps me alive *

01:25:40.503 --> 01:25:42.938
* I've gotta be me *

01:25:43.005 --> 01:25:45.541
* I've gotta be me *

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:50.746
* The dream that I see
makes me what I am *

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:53.081
* That faraway prize *

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.618
* A world of success *

01:25:55.684 --> 01:26:00.789
* Is waitin' for me
if I heed the call *

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:03.226
* I won't settle down *

01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:05.828
* Or settle for less *

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:10.866
* As long as there is a chance
that I can have it all *

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:13.336
* I'll go it alone *

01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:15.838
* That's how it must be *

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.507
* I can't be right
for nobody else *

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:20.976
* If I'm not right for me *

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:23.312
* I gotta be free *

01:26:23.379 --> 01:26:26.249
* I gotta be free *

01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:28.517
* Daring to try
to do it or die *

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:30.819
* I've gotta be me *

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:33.456
* I've gotta be me *
* I've gotta be me *

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.858
* I've gotta be me *
* I've gotta be me *

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:38.694
* I've gotta be me *
* I've gotta be me *

01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:43.566
* One, two, three
Gotta be me **

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:58.947
And cut!
