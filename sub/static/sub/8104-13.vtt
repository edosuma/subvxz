00:03.170 --> 00:04.796
It's all about the tongue, man.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.090
You stick it in their mouth,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.593
but not all the way.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.969
They like that?

00:12.096 --> 00:13.638
Dude, they love it.

00:15.391 --> 00:16.724
What are you doing?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.101
Climbing.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.855
Just deep enough to lick her teeth,

00:22.981 --> 00:25.983
slow, one at a time,
like you're painting them.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.445
This girl Rachel, she's a junior.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.947
She's experienced.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.907
Mom says I gotta be home by 5:00.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.994
Just chill, okay? And hop the fence
before someone sees you.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.336
Are you sure this is okay?

00:45.462 --> 00:47.004
Dave's mom's a realtor.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.716
If it's for sale and empty,
it's a clubhouse.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.385
And if you say anything, you're dead.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.888
I told them you were cool.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.890
These are very serious dudes.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.687
Come on.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.774
Cub Scout meeting's down the street,
boys.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.904
- What a loser.
- Lame.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.532
Gabe's cool, man.
He's one of us.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.992
He better be.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.832
I'm not thirsty.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.918
What's this?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.378
Club business, little man.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.796
What shall we ask?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.089
Put your hands on.

01:32.926 --> 01:37.680
O dark spirit, will any of us die
in the year to come?

01:42.895 --> 01:43.728
You're moving it.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.563
Put your hands back.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.232
Now.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.032
Who among us will die?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.333
"G,"

02:09.922 --> 02:10.963
"A."

02:12.090 --> 02:13.466
Oh, man.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.260
"B,"

02:22.267 --> 02:23.726
"E."

02:23.852 --> 02:25.269
"Gabe."

02:25.395 --> 02:26.813
That blows.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.864
That's it. We're going to the hospital.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.492
No, Mom. I'm too tired.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.745
Come on, sweetie. You've had a fever
for almost a week now.

02:49.545 --> 02:50.545
Ow!

02:50.671 --> 02:51.712
Oh, my God.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.799
Oh, Gabe. Are you okay?

02:54.925 --> 02:58.094
Are you okay? Baby, what's wrong?

03:01.265 --> 03:02.807
I'm dying.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.816
12-year-old male.
Spiking fever, congested chest,

03:53.942 --> 03:56.360
coughing up green sputum,
pain in breathing.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.905
Baffling,
though I vaguely recall a disease

03:59.031 --> 04:01.449
called "meunomia"? "Pneumania"?

04:01.575 --> 04:05.161
But his chest X-ray and CT scan
show an atypical pattern for pneumonia.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.954
Pneumonia! That's it.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.041
Just a guess here,
but his parents big donors?

04:10.167 --> 04:13.461
No infiltrate,
just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.964
Tiny unicorns goring his bronchial
tubes would be cooler,

04:17.090 --> 04:19.008
and the way
you're ignoring the question,

04:19.134 --> 04:21.719
wow, they're extremely big donors.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.804
He's not responding to cefuroxime,

04:23.931 --> 04:27.266
his pulse ox is dropping much faster
than it should for pneumonia,

04:27.392 --> 04:28.976
and plus he's got an odd little rash.

04:29.102 --> 04:29.977
Excessive irritation.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.521
- He's 12. He's on auto-stroke.
- On his arm.

04:32.648 --> 04:36.067
Papular lesion, one centimeter,
on top of a long, thin scab.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.111
Ah. You need a dermatologist.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.364
If it's dry, keep it wet.
If it's wet, keep it dry.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.115
If it's not supposed to be there,
cut it off.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.784
I never could master all that.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.369
There you are.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.829
Were you scared?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.414
It's okay. You're home now.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.417
Fine.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.877
Cuddy.

04:57.589 --> 04:58.839
As a special favor to you...

04:58.966 --> 05:02.343
No. Admit it. I got you with the rash.

05:02.469 --> 05:07.556
The rash is a total snooze, unless
it's connected to the pneumonia,

05:09.601 --> 05:11.394
then it's party time.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.693
Purulent sputum, dyspnea,
rhonchi bilaterally.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.987
What kind of pneumonia
causes this kind of rash?

05:21.113 --> 05:22.029
Legionnaire's disease.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.990
Usually means
industrial ventilation systems,

05:24.116 --> 05:25.741
convention centers. He's 12 years old.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.328
Send off a urine antigen and check
if he's joined the Elks. Next?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.746
- Fungal.
- Excellent.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.498
Maybe the lodge went spelunking.

05:32.624 --> 05:33.791
Chlamydia pneumonia.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.960
12-year-olds don't have sex.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.712
Their mistake.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.549
That's it? Other possibilities?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.467
What if we're thinking about
this backwards?

05:43.593 --> 05:47.096
The rash came first,
caused the pneumonia. Nice.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.889
Rickettsial. Tick bite.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.892
Nymphal ticks are out now.
They're bloodthirsty little bastards.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.602
Rash would be more pustular.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.646
Not always,
and there's only one rash, which fits.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.481
New Jersey,
it's most likely Lyme Disease.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.984
All right. Let's keep him on fluids

06:00.110 --> 06:02.236
and the cefuroxime to be safe.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.196
Biopsy that rash.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.242
And take another history. Even if we
don't learn what's causing this,

06:08.368 --> 06:12.747
we definitely need to know if
12-year-olds are getting any action.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.126
What are you doing now?

06:17.252 --> 06:18.753
We're collecting fluids from the rash.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.837
Why?

06:19.963 --> 06:20.963
They know what they're doing, Jeffrey.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.717
Great endorsement coming from the
woman who thought it was a nasty cold.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.052
If I had had him last week...

06:26.178 --> 06:27.887
This isn't helping.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.308
We're checking to see
if your son has a tick bite.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.019
Gabe, have you been camping recently,

06:35.145 --> 06:37.688
playing sports outside,
anything like that?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.065
I'm not that good at sports.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.025
No hanging out anywhere new,
strange places?

06:41.151 --> 06:42.026
We've been through this.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.279
We don't let him run wild
through the neighborhood, right?

06:48.075 --> 06:51.368
Okay. This might be a bit delicate.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.539
We need to know
if you're sexually active.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.665
I beg your pardon?

06:56.792 --> 06:57.750
Mr. Reilich, we need to...

06:57.876 --> 06:59.043
No.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.922
Nothing like that.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.719
We've gotta get another CT scan,
check his lungs again.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.679
- Third floor, right?
- Yeah, Radiology is just...

07:10.806 --> 07:13.516
Sorry, medical personnel only.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.104
Where's the machine?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.022
Well, we passed it, actually.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.732
A little tension in the room
back there.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.484
Thought you could use a break.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.320
Your dad's a pretty high-powered guy.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.199
Yeah. He was an Air Force test pilot.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.034
Real "Top Gun" stuff.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.078
Flew mach 3.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.455
Hard to deal with sometimes?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.582
Guess I'm more like my mom.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.708
Listen.

07:41.169 --> 07:44.672
I promise to keep my mouth shut,
but I need to know.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.801
You definitely haven't had
any sexual contact of any kind?

07:48.927 --> 07:50.219
I wish.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.972
You know what?

07:53.098 --> 07:56.350
Girls like the cool guys now,
but give it a few years.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.894
They start liking the smart guys.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.813
You'll be all right.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.443
Can you keep a secret?

08:06.570 --> 08:08.779
I have to. It's my job.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.035
I'm cursed. I'm not kidding.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.872
This sÃ©ance thing the kids did?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.707
It spelled out my name.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.834
Said I was gonna die.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.752
First name and last name?

08:23.879 --> 08:26.797
We've got a Gabe upstairs
who's very old, very sick.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.759
No. It's me. I have the worst luck.

08:30.886 --> 08:33.846
One time I broke this mirror,

08:33.972 --> 08:37.141
the next week,
my parents got separated.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.435
My parents split up, too.

08:39.561 --> 08:43.105
Every kid feels like it's his fault.
It never is.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.400
So, what about the rest of the stuff?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.944
Any playing outside
your parents don't know about?

08:49.070 --> 08:50.988
Anything like that?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.949
Maybe you were somewhere
you weren't supposed to be?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.784
Triage nurse,
pick up line 274.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.786
Oh, man.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.998
Gabe, it's important.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.046
A secret club. What's the secret?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.839
They're all morons?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.549
He fell on something in the attic,

09:10.675 --> 09:13.594
scraped his arm,
got the rash the next day.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.971
Said it smelled really moldy up there.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.767
Fungal pneumonia
without the cave. Clever.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.101
I'm gonna get a sample.

09:22.979 --> 09:27.942
Dr. Chase, you have a few moments?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.987
Sorry, I've gotta go.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.243
These young doctors.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.578
It's like they don't care about people.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.871
No manners.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.623
My fault, probably.

09:43.875 --> 09:48.587
That's an interesting accent
you have there. I'd say Czech

09:48.713 --> 09:51.465
with about 30 years of Aussie.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.467
You have quite an ear.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.178
You're Chase's dad.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.057
Hard to miss, you know, the big hug

10:00.183 --> 10:02.601
and how happy he was to see you.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.570
- Need a consult.
- With a patient.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.489
Urgent doctor stuff.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.996
Twenty-six-year-old male,
sudden loss of the ability to speak.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.665
Just because you got out of clinic duty
doesn't mean everybody did.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.791
To his father.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.459
Differential diagnosis?

10:27.585 --> 10:28.585
Chase?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.588
Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.965
Dad say why he was here?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.009
See? You asked.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.013
Dad comes 5,000 miles,
you're more curious than Junior is.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.681
Can't just be about the divorce.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.892
It's been 15 years,
and Mom's been dead for 10 of them.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.644
You think Daddy murdered her?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.147
You want to get to the bottom of this,
you're doing it exactly right.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.773
Don't talk to the people involved.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.899
Drag your buddy away from work

10:51.026 --> 10:52.776
for some pointless speculation.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.529
You want to know how two chemicals
interact, do you ask them?

10:55.655 --> 10:59.408
No. They're gonna lie through
their lying little chemical teeth.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.286
Throw them in a beaker and apply heat.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.705
Even I don't like you.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.999
You know, words can hurt.

11:21.765 --> 11:25.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, guys.
I don't care that you're up here.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.728
You a cop?

11:27.854 --> 11:30.647
Doctor. I'm treating Gabe Reilich.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.900
He said he fell over near some pipes?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.651
Yeah, over there.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.696
What, here?

11:37.822 --> 11:38.906
Yeah.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.659
Any of you guys
been feeling sick lately?

11:42.786 --> 11:44.787
Rash, cold, anything?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.121
No.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.379
Oh, crap.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.005
He is a cop!

11:55.131 --> 11:56.215
Damn it!

12:18.738 --> 12:21.782
He fell on it.
Some weird kind of insulation.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.618
It's old. House was built in the '60s.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.120
What's it made of?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.664
Felt. Fibers of what, cotton?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.796
Sorry. Forgotten
how funny your dad was.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.965
Not as funny as you.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.925
High praise.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.220
I know how protective
kids can be of their parents.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.769
Not cotton. Animal hair.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.731
Get me the CT scan.

12:59.237 --> 13:03.240
First, find the name of the company
that made the insulation,

13:03.366 --> 13:05.033
and second, tell me what I'm seeing

13:05.160 --> 13:08.078
that makes me want to
short their stock.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.998
Enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.082
Peribronchial thickening.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.250
Pleural effusions.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.711
Less obvious, more scary.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.756
Well, the mediastinum
doesn't look right.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.175
Slightly widened.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.760
Oh, God.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.431
It can be transmitted through
infected animal hair.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.557
But the Gram's stain
would have shown...

13:28.683 --> 13:29.933
No. The cefuroxime would have killed

13:30.059 --> 13:31.685
some of it, clouded the result.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.563
We've gotta get this kid on Levaquin.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.442
What does he have?

13:38.985 --> 13:43.447
Anthrax.
This house belong to old man Hussein?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.744
Maybe he is cursed.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.676
Anthrax.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.513
So what, you think there were
terrorists in that attic?

14:07.639 --> 14:09.598
It's a naturally occurring bacteria.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.517
We believe it was in the insulation.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.643
How sick is he?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.896
Anthrax is very dangerous,
but we've caught it early.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.315
He's on Levaquin.
It's the best antibiotic we have.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.525
Lisa, you buy this?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.069
Jeff, you've helped our hospital a lot.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.946
I wouldn't have assigned
Dr. House to your case

14:24.072 --> 14:25.489
if I didn't have
every confidence in him.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.699
- Then who's this guy?
- Jeffrey!

14:27.825 --> 14:29.743
There's all these weird diseases that
can cause a rash.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.287
What about leishmaniasis or filariasis?

14:32.413 --> 14:33.497
Where'd you hear about those?

14:33.623 --> 14:34.623
Internet. I did some research.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.542
Well, those are very rare conditions.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.544
And anthrax grows along the interstate?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.879
Leishmaniasis doesn't cause pneumonia,
and filariasis...

14:41.005 --> 14:42.172
Just look into everything.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.799
This is my son, all right?

14:43.925 --> 14:46.260
And I'm gonna stay on top of you
until I know he's safe.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.845
I wouldn't expect anything else.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.850
Everyone's a doctor.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.150
Breathe, baby. It's okay.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.610
Breathe. I need you to breathe.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.362
- His breathing...
- It's on the inhale.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.488
What does that mean?

15:06.614 --> 15:08.198
It means his airway's closing up.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.826
Is the anthrax doing it?

15:10.952 --> 15:12.160
All right. Hold still, Gabe.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.289
This is gonna be
a little uncomfortable.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.299
We've got you. It's okay.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.302
Nodules in his throat.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.511
Airway's occluded?

15:29.637 --> 15:31.221
We've got to intubate. Ativan!

15:31.347 --> 15:32.889
Pushing 3 cc's.

15:43.818 --> 15:44.818
Airway's too tight.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.945
What's wrong? What's wrong?
No, you're killing him!

15:47.071 --> 15:48.697
Jeffrey! Let them do their job.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.073
Airway's too tight.
Get me a smaller tube.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.158
We're traching.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.576
Smaller tube.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.000
- His lips are cyanotic.
- Oh, my God, he's not breathing.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.376
Foreman, we're traching.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.420
No. I can do it. I'll get it.

16:04.714 --> 16:05.964
Foreman,
you're not getting through.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.841
He's not getting air.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.925
We have to trach him right now.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.052
No, I can do it.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.678
Betadine.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.977
I'm doing this.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.980
Got it.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.911
He's okay.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.084
Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?

16:42.210 --> 16:43.418
I don't think so.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.296
We switched him to rifampin, and there
was no change in the swelling.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.839
We should try another antibiotic.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.175
You really think he's allergic to
two antibiotics?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.719
I wanna know what Dr. Chase thinks.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.929
It's possible he's allergic...

16:54.055 --> 16:56.306
Oh! I'm sorry. Not you.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.141
Understandable mistake.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.601
The other Dr. Chase.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.439
Boy gets anthrax

17:04.565 --> 17:08.026
and happens to be allergic to
two antibiotics.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.945
Hate to step on anybody's toes,

17:10.071 --> 17:12.906
but is it possible your guys
got this one wrong?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.908
The rash is classic anthrax.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.201
Except the color.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.828
The rash hasn't turned black yet.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.162
No necrosis, no anthrax.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.958
Necrosis can theoretically take
as long as two weeks.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.753
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:26.879 --> 17:29.840
Guys, it's not a competition.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.341
It's a diagnosis.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.303
Okay. Who thinks Junior wins?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.683
Four to one. It's not anthrax.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.685
So we start over. What's changed?

17:41.811 --> 17:43.645
What do the nodules tell us?

17:44.689 --> 17:46.231
Sarcoidosis.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.234
Excellent. Send an ACE level.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.738
If it comes back positive,
put him on methotrexate.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.993
We ran some tests, and
the results point toward sarcoidosis.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.662
It makes the body's tissue swell up.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.914
It seems to have gone
after Gabriel's skin and lungs

18:03.040 --> 18:04.958
and given him this fever.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.126
Doctor.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.758
We don't know what causes it.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.843
But you're sure he has this one?

18:14.969 --> 18:17.554
We have a world-renowned doctor
consulting.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.973
He's convinced this is sarcoidosis.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.099
Is it treatable?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.809
Very, actually.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.895
See, this is IV methotrexate.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.938
It's an anti-inflammatory.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.984
It should make all the swelling go down
and get you all better.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.068
Stop.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.407
My God, it's black.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.827
Necrosis.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.289
It's definitely anthrax,
and it definitely can't be anthrax.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.124
It doesn't cause throat nodules.

18:46.250 --> 18:51.087
Only explanation is, this kid's got
anthrax and sarcoidosis.

18:51.214 --> 18:55.509
Right, two incredibly rare diseases
just happening to strike at once.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.344
Unless you've got a better theory.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.137
Anthrax plus an allergic reaction.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.933
Call 'The Lancet', because that's
one bizarre allergic reaction.

19:03.059 --> 19:06.228
Come on. There's no reason
you both can't be wrong.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.730
It's not allergy,
but it's not coincidence either.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.024
Disease number one set off
disease number two.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.776
Anthrax weakened his immune system.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.237
And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.240
Keep him on antibiotics for the
anthrax, and start the methotrexate

19:18.366 --> 19:21.159
for the sarcoidosis. See what happens.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.452
Fine.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.872
Better go with him.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.917
Make sure he doesn't snap
and hurt somebody.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.422
Yeah, but you're treating him
for both diseases.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.007
We're covering all the bases.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.510
What? Throw everything against the wall
and see what sticks?

19:38.636 --> 19:40.387
Works for spaghetti.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.955
Are you being funny?

20:07.081 --> 20:08.582
Apparently not.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.084
You know why I give money
to this hospital?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.795
It's the only way to get attention.
See this?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.088
Is this a magic trick?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.549
'Cause I am
a total David Copperfield fan.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.885
Although I thought that tornado of
fire, that seemed a little fake.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.095
Pain in the wrist.
It won't go away for months.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.265
Six doctors' brilliant conclusion is
to take it easy.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.684
I write a check, name goes on a plaque,

20:27.810 --> 20:29.686
and 48 hours later I've got two MRIs,

20:29.812 --> 20:32.063
a bone scan and a diagnosis,
carpal tunnel.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.941
I'm in surgery that afternoon.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.693
Fascinating story.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.779
Have you thought of
adapting it for the stage?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.199
I love my...
Look at me. I love my son.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.659
I love him more than anything else
in the world.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.661
You're gonna start
paying attention to this case

20:46.787 --> 20:47.787
or I'm gonna make things miserable...

20:47.914 --> 20:49.164
Go back to your son's room.
I'm not leaving here

20:49.290 --> 20:50.457
until you get your ass...

20:50.583 --> 20:52.584
There's a problem.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.886
What is it?

21:04.305 --> 21:05.639
I don't know.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.332
Skin lesions are spreading
all over his body.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.043
They're opening up,
and the fatty tissues are oozing out.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.044
He'll be septic in a matter of days.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.631
Death by dermatitis.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.257
Where's Robert?

21:41.384 --> 21:43.176
He has clinic duty this morning.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.636
No, he doesn't.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.179
I rescheduled you guys
so you'd be free.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.516
Yeah, but he re-rescheduled himself.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.226
Hmm.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.899
It doesn't hurt yet.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.275
Keep going.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.528
You page me?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.321
No, I don't need you. Come on.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.739
We all need help now and again.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.409
You're getting a consult.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.536
Okay. We've got new skin lesions,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.204
bigger and uglier.
What would cause that?

22:11.330 --> 22:12.330
My hand hurts.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.250
What if his body worked so hard
attacking the anthrax

22:15.376 --> 22:17.085
that it started attacking itself?

22:17.211 --> 22:18.211
Autoimmune.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.671
Wouldn't present this aggressively.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.756
It's not likely, but it is possible.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.758
What, in a 12-year-old male?

22:23.884 --> 22:25.218
This isn't about me, is it?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.886
Gabe's dad found leishmaniasis

22:27.013 --> 22:29.014
and filariasis
on the Internet yesterday.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.890
They didn't fit then,
but now they kind of do.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.143
Sure, except for the nodules,

22:33.269 --> 22:35.437
and we're not working out of
Calcutta General.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.188
Multiple neurofibromatosis.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.274
You think this is neurological?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.109
The only reason
you're thinking autoimmune

22:41.235 --> 22:42.736
is because you're a rheumatologist.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.196
If you were a proctologist,
you'd think rectal cancer.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.657
Gotta go with Senior.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.743
He literally wrote the book
on this one.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.036
Autoimmune is a big universe.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.997
It could be anything from scleroderma
to Churg-Strauss.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.373
Whatever it is,
we should start him on steroids,

22:55.499 --> 22:56.499
keep the swelling down.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.169
A hundred milligrams of cytoxan,
it treats most autoimmunes.

22:59.295 --> 23:03.923
Well, give it to him now before the fat
starts dripping out his eyeballs.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.011
Hey, my fingers are numb.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.305
Your watch is on too tight.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.315
You're messing with my head.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.733
Your relationship with your dad

23:21.859 --> 23:23.318
is messing with your ability
to do your job.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.653
Only because you made my dad
part of my job.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.738
Good point.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.656
You haven't seen him in years,
he flies across the Atlantic

23:28.783 --> 23:29.908
- to see you.
- Pacific.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.951
You breeze by him like he's
a Hare Krishna at the airport,

23:32.078 --> 23:33.995
you don't even ask why he's in town.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.955
It's probably a conference.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.248
Probably.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.752
I was hoping to do this through
sheer manipulation,

23:40.878 --> 23:43.671
but if you insist on talking, fine.
Talk.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.008
What did he do to you?

23:47.134 --> 23:50.220
How would you feel if I interfered
in your personal life?

23:50.346 --> 23:53.973
I'd hate it. That's why I cleverly have
no personal life.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.142
I'm gonna biopsy his skin lesions.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.562
Good thinking.
Prove your dad wrong.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.231
That'll solve everything.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.291
Who extubated him?

24:20.417 --> 24:21.376
I did.

24:21.502 --> 24:24.712
Temperature's down two degrees,
and the swelling's almost gone.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.090
And his skin looks better, too.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.134
Cytoxan is working.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.385
Feeling better, Gabe?

24:30.511 --> 24:32.137
Yep, a lot.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.431
Dr. Chase,
can you and I have a word?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.228
Your diagnosis is wrong.

24:40.354 --> 24:41.938
No autoimmune disease.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.649
The swelling's probably just down
because we've got him on steroids.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.651
It's masking whatever's really wrong.

24:46.777 --> 24:47.986
ANA's are unreliable.

24:48.112 --> 24:52.323
Phospholipid antibodies are negative,
so no lupus. Same for Churg-Strauss.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.450
You're arguing with a rheumatologist.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.578
There's about 20 distinct
autoimmune diseases.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.288
Why are you here?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.959
SLE conference.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.878
You were in New York last year

25:05.004 --> 25:08.006
for the scleroderma conference.
I didn't hear anything from you.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.883
Just wanted to say hi this time.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.051
You said it. You're still here.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.179
I miss you.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.600
I was 15 years old when you walked out.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.768
Now you're walking back in?

25:20.895 --> 25:23.271
I left your mother. I didn't leave you.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.106
Mum was living on gin and tonics.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.816
How was I supposed to take care of her?

25:26.942 --> 25:28.318
She wasn't your responsibility.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.862
I know! She was yours.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.825
I'm sorry she died.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.994
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.749
But she was falling apart
long before...

25:42.875 --> 25:46.002
I've got to talk to House
about this treatment.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.343
But the patient's getting better.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.345
In spite of the cytoxan.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.431
On the other hand, getting better.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.893
Cytoxan makes him
more susceptible to infection.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.520
The anthrax could relapse
and be more resistant.

26:04.647 --> 26:05.688
Better!

26:05.814 --> 26:08.691
You want a negative test for every
autoimmune disease known to man?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.610
Fine. I'll get them.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.156
Be home by midnight or you can't have
the car this weekend.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.659
You guys talk?

26:17.785 --> 26:19.327
Did he tell you why he's here?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.247
The SLE conference.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.969
Going back to the conference?

26:36.095 --> 26:39.347
Afternoon panel.
I hope I can stay awake.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.391
I hope you can get in.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.850
You're not registered.

26:47.022 --> 26:50.733
I get it. You had to make up a lie.

26:51.235 --> 26:54.112
Can't just tell your kid
you're here to see him.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.698
I mean, what father does that?

26:58.909 --> 27:01.577
That little blue dot under your collar,

27:01.745 --> 27:04.539
it's a tattoo for guiding
radiation treatment.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.917
I was looking for it after I saw
what you had for breakfast,

27:08.043 --> 27:09.127
brown rice, vegetables.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.170
It's a macrobiotic diet,

27:11.297 --> 27:15.216
popular with Hollywood starlets
and cancer patients.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.721
Lungs. Stage IV.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.057
You look good.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.267
I'm not.

27:25.019 --> 27:29.772
Came to the States to go to
Sloan-Kettering and see Dr. Wilson.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.524
What'd he say?

27:32.443 --> 27:33.609
Three months.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.362
But you haven't told Robert.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.491
You don't want to burden him,
because you were such a lousy dad.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.954
I'd prefer you not tell him.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.750
Yeah. That's better.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.296
I'll get to see his face
when he reads his dad's obituary.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.340
It's not your business.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.886
I suppose it isn't.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.980
You sure do a lot of tests.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.941
If we figure out exactly
which autoimmune condition it is,

28:14.068 --> 28:16.110
we can get you better quicker.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.404
Was that your dad before?

28:18.530 --> 28:19.614
Yeah.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.657
That's so cool.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.576
Do you guys work together a lot?

28:24.495 --> 28:26.162
Not really.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.122
When can I go home?

28:28.248 --> 28:29.415
We'll see.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.377
Looks like you got your appetite back.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.836
That's a good sign.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.298
- Want some water?
- Yes.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.138
Here you go.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.266
Whoops!

28:47.393 --> 28:48.976
That's all right. Water's cheap.

28:49.103 --> 28:50.395
Oh, God.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.022
What?

28:54.358 --> 28:56.734
I... I can't move my hand.

29:07.204 --> 29:10.123
Can you squeeze my fingers
for me, Gabe?

29:15.796 --> 29:16.879
He's getting worse.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.215
Now his entire right hand
and forearm are paralyzed.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.134
And his fever's back. It's up over 105.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.927
If we don't stop
the nerve deterioration quickly,

29:23.053 --> 29:24.554
he'll be paralyzed for life.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.807
Well, luckily, at this rate
that should only last about a week.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.766
Okay. So...

29:28.892 --> 29:31.644
I told you we should get him off
the cytoxan.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.271
This is toxic neuropathy.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.022
We've been shoving drugs
into his system

29:35.149 --> 29:36.357
for a disease he doesn't have.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.276
Well, it could be neurological.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.987
What kind of brain process
would cause a paralyzed hand,

29:41.113 --> 29:44.615
skin lesions
and swollen throat nodules?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.868
Robert was right.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.412
You said multiple neurofibromatosis.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.165
Are you saying that for the chance
at a beautiful family moment,

29:52.291 --> 29:53.875
or is there some medicine involved?

29:54.001 --> 29:55.460
Mmm-mmm. Fits better.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.920
Too bad. I was hoping
for the other reason.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.881
I was gonna go get my camera.

30:00.007 --> 30:03.009
Get a CT scan. His brain this time.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.936
You'd think three copies
would be enough, right?

30:14.062 --> 30:17.273
One's always been
more than enough for me.

30:17.399 --> 30:21.235
Why didn't you tell me
that Rowan Chase was in to see you?

30:21.778 --> 30:22.987
Excuse me.

30:24.031 --> 30:27.700
Ethics, confidentiality,
does any of this ring a bell?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.536
You could have covered yourself,
called me in for a consult.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.663
It is a juicy piece of gossip.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.748
You know what happened?

30:33.874 --> 30:36.834
I got all focused on his cancer
and lost perspective.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.794
You can't tell Chase, but I can.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.046
What should I do?

30:40.172 --> 30:41.923
This is where I give you advice

30:42.049 --> 30:44.550
and pretend you're gonna listen to it.
I like this part.

30:44.718 --> 30:45.968
Did Rowan ask you not to tell?

30:46.094 --> 30:47.553
I promised I wouldn't.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.680
My fingers were crossed, though,
so I'm wide open.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.933
I was wrong.
This is the musing-out-loud part.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.142
Do I actually need to be here?

30:53.268 --> 30:54.477
Telling him.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.312
Now, that's got
real entertainment value.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.481
Mmm. He might even cry.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.067
On the other hand,
there is the do-unto-others thingy.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.860
Well,
then I should definitely tell him.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.154
- I'd wanna know.
- You wanna know everything.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.074
There's also
the keeping-your-promises thingy.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.743
You never run out of thingies,

31:10.869 --> 31:13.079
like that blonde thingy
you were chatting up.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.582
She's the hospital accountant.
We were going over billing procedures.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.584
Double-entry bookkeeping?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.757
What are you gonna do?

31:26.260 --> 31:27.927
Billing procedures.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.679
They're so complicated, aren't they?

31:47.072 --> 31:50.700
You know, parents are never as bad as
kids think they are.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.578
If you like my dad so much,
ask him out.

31:54.663 --> 31:55.955
I'd make an excellent step mom.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.832
I'm very lenient.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.131
He's your father.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.633
You never see him, and he's here.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.469
Unless he's done some unspeakable
thing, you should lighten up.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.722
Great. Thanks for the tip.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.141
Okay.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.104
He beat your mom. He beat you.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.650
- What did he do?
- Really, don't push it.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.992
All this hate. It's toxic.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.121
Then stay away.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.591
There's nothing there.

32:48.717 --> 32:52.637
No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing.

32:52.763 --> 32:57.391
- It's not neurofibromatosis.
- Drs. Chase are 0 for 3.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.518
Even when they agree, they're wrong.

32:59.645 --> 33:03.105
So, next, what else could cause neural
damage as well as all the nodules?

33:03.231 --> 33:04.190
Berger's disease.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.441
He's never been out of the country.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.610
Have his parents?
They could have brought it back.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.278
- I don't think so.
- It doesn't matter.

33:09.404 --> 33:12.073
His lesions are in the wrong place.
His feet are the one clear spot.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.200
Kid's dad mentioned leishmaniasis.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.576
Yeah, and filariasis.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.411
But the throat nodules
still don't fit with that.

33:17.537 --> 33:21.290
That's two diseases pretty much
exclusive to Southeast Asia.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.756
What if the anthrax didn't set off
the second disease?

33:29.633 --> 33:30.883
We're back at coincidence again?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.803
No. What if something else
was the trigger?

33:33.929 --> 33:35.221
Nothing else happened.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.472
We happened.

33:36.598 --> 33:37.640
Antibiotics?

33:37.766 --> 33:40.309
We've been through this.
It's not an allergy.

33:41.478 --> 33:42.853
I gotta pee.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.745
What did the CT scan tell you?

33:59.871 --> 34:00.996
Nothing.

34:02.040 --> 34:02.998
Ow!

34:03.125 --> 34:04.792
Scale from one to ten, how painful?

34:04.918 --> 34:06.794
Not half as painful as when
I punch you in the face.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.004
Don't do that. It'll hurt you.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.424
Carpal tunnel surgery
obviously didn't work.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.717
Who are you?

34:12.843 --> 34:15.469
The little ones call me Uncle Greg.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.972
Your dad never had carpal tunnel.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.891
You mentioned two obscure diseases
to Dr. Chase.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.226
How did you know about them?

34:22.352 --> 34:23.394
I read about them on the Internet.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.520
What did you search for?

34:24.646 --> 34:26.939
"Diseases from Asia that don't match
my son's symptoms"?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.190
You heard about them in Asia.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.358
I've never been there.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.403
Well, you probably just forgot.
Let me refresh your memory,

34:32.529 --> 34:37.491
some remote, dusty village,
close quarters, at least a year?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.368
- Starting to come back?
- I'm calling Dr. Cuddy.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.829
Excuse me, what does this have to do
with our son?

34:41.955 --> 34:43.706
Your dad's pissed off.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.040
He should be.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.294
Comes here expecting us to do
an extra-good job

34:48.420 --> 34:50.337
because he gives a whole lot of money
to this hospital.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.797
Don't talk to my son like that!

34:51.923 --> 34:53.507
Just telling him my job
and my obligation...

34:53.633 --> 34:56.719
Stop! What's going on?

35:01.475 --> 35:04.727
There's only one thing
you guys have gotta do.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.107
Tell the truth, or your son will die.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.111
How long were you in Asia?

35:18.366 --> 35:20.618
Jeff, it's a simple question.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.582
Two years, in India.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.877
Why would you lie
about something like that?

35:30.003 --> 35:31.796
It was '87 and '88.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.469
This...

35:40.931 --> 35:44.725
This guru,
I thought he had some answers.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.770
I went to his ashram

35:49.397 --> 35:54.360
and ended up with no money
and no answers.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.657
I was embarrassed.
I didn't want anyone to know.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.284
No.

36:04.204 --> 36:07.456
No. You were a test pilot.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.291
I'm so sorry, Gabe.

36:11.253 --> 36:14.004
What does this have to do with my son?

36:19.344 --> 36:21.846
Clue number one, if I were Jesus,

36:21.972 --> 36:25.599
curing this kid would be as easy as
turning water into wine.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.268
Demonic possession?

36:27.394 --> 36:29.436
Close, but no wafer.

36:29.563 --> 36:32.898
Clue number two,
Rheumatology Rowan was almost right.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.526
It causes autoimmune symptoms.

36:35.652 --> 36:36.819
Leprosy?

36:36.945 --> 36:39.071
Yeah, that's real big
in the Jersey suburbs.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.615
It's leprosy.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.576
Run a Fite stain. It'll be positive.

36:44.411 --> 36:47.204
Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of
Indian ashram.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.040
But it's obviously dormant in the dad.
How could the kid catch it?

36:50.166 --> 36:52.626
It's not dormant in the dad.
It's just slow.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.295
Damaged his ulnar nerves.

36:54.421 --> 36:59.884
Was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.
Never trust doctors. Run a Fite stain.

37:00.343 --> 37:04.471
No wonder he got anthrax. The leprosy
weakened his immune system.

37:04.598 --> 37:08.017
Vicious circle, the leprosy made him
vulnerable to the anthrax,

37:08.143 --> 37:10.728
and the anthrax treatment
put the leprosy in overdrive.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.272
But the antibiotics we gave him,
they cure leprosy.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.901
Yeah. That's where the trouble starts.

37:17.027 --> 37:21.113
The antibiotics hit the nerve strands.
They kill the leprosy bacteria,

37:21.239 --> 37:22.948
and the corpses
get tossed into the system.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.118
And as fascinating as our bodies are,
they're also stupid.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.331
They produce antibodies
to beat dead bacteria.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.958
And these aren't the polite antibodies.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.754
They're the ones that won't sit still,
kick during nap time.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.714
They attack his neural and fat cells,

37:38.840 --> 37:42.134
causing inflammation
and all the rest of his symptoms.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.553
So the cure's killing him.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.889
I want you to call down to Carville,
Louisiana,

37:47.015 --> 37:49.934
home of the last leper colony
in the Lower 48.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.769
Get them to send up some thalidomide.

37:51.895 --> 37:52.895
Thalidomide?

37:53.021 --> 37:55.147
12-year-olds don't have sex,
right? So he can't be pregnant.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.899
Make the call.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.614
I need to speak to your boy.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.588
Why does everybody need to know
my business?

38:19.714 --> 38:22.174
People like talking about people.

38:22.300 --> 38:26.011
Makes us feel superior,
makes us feel in control,

38:26.137 --> 38:30.933
and sometimes, for some people,
knowing some things makes them care.

38:31.059 --> 38:34.687
I tell you my dad left,
my mum drank herself to death,

38:34.813 --> 38:37.773
- you gonna care about me more?
- Cameron would.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.984
Me, I just like knowing stuff.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.738
I know you hate your dad.

38:44.864 --> 38:45.990
Now, I'm gonna tell you something.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.242
I don't hate him.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.327
I loved him until I figured out

38:50.453 --> 38:53.622
that it hurts a lot less
to just not care.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.875
You don't expect him to turn up
to your football match,

38:57.002 --> 38:58.961
no disappointments.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.462
You don't expect a call
on your birthday,

39:00.588 --> 39:02.381
don't expect to see him for months,

39:02.507 --> 39:04.299
no disappointments.

39:05.802 --> 39:10.889
You want us to go make up, sink a few
beers together, nice family hug?

39:14.144 --> 39:17.312
I've given him enough hugs.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.565
He's given me enough disappointments.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.195
Okay.

39:28.742 --> 39:29.950
That's it?

39:30.869 --> 39:32.077
That's it.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.352
Breathe.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.232
Breathe again.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.986
Breathe again.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.240
Are you gonna have to tell my friends
I'm a leper?

40:10.366 --> 40:13.911
You had the antibiotics.
You're not contagious anymore.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.456
Well, what if they already caught it?

40:17.582 --> 40:21.919
Leprosy is incredibly hard to catch.
Even your mum didn't get it.

40:22.045 --> 40:24.379
Right. I want you to make a fist.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.966
It's still kinda stiff.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.177
It'll get back to normal
in a month or two.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.513
Your skin, two or three weeks.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.765
Security 12, call...

40:35.433 --> 40:37.935
You haven't asked about your dad.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.563
He lied about everything.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.151
He lied to my mom. He lied to his boss.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.113
He's just a liar.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.074
He loves you.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.619
I don't love him.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.498
Yeah, you do.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.591
Nothing you can do about it.
He's your dad.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.095
It doesn't matter what he does.
You're gonna love him.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.193
Here. Thanks.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.155
Hey!

41:42.792 --> 41:44.334
When's your flight?

41:44.460 --> 41:45.752
You got time for a drink?

41:46.921 --> 41:48.213
Wish I did.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.549
Dr. Chase?

42:00.643 --> 42:02.060
I got it.

42:05.607 --> 42:08.775
You're gonna be getting down to Oz
any time soon?

42:10.361 --> 42:13.363
Not too long. Next autumn, I hope.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.074
I'll call you.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.288
Well, you're all set.

42:30.423 --> 42:31.965
I'll see you.

42:32.175 --> 42:33.175
Yeah.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.844
I'll see you.
