WEBVTT

02:30.484 --> 02:32.151
Men, are you over 40?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.946
When you wake up in
the morning, do you
feel tired and rundown?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.155
Do you have that
listless feeling?

04:15.339 --> 04:16.339
Jefferies.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.548
Congratulations, Jeff.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.591
For what?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.384
For getting rid
of that cast.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.428
Who said I was
getting rid of it?

04:22.512 --> 04:23.971
This is Wednesday.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.850
Seven weeks from
the day you broke
your leg. Yes or no?

04:28.936 --> 04:33.564
Gunnison, how did you ever
get to be such a big editor
with such a small memory?

04:33.649 --> 04:35.608
Thrift, industry
and hard work.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.778
And catching
the publisher with
his secretary.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.820
Did I get
the wrong day?

04:39.905 --> 04:41.614
No.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.449
No, wrong week.

04:43.533 --> 04:48.162
Next Wednesday
I emerge from this
plaster cocoon.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.289
That's too
bad, Jeff.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.167
Well, I guess I can't
be lucky every day.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.585
Forget I called.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.964
Yeah, I sure
feel sorry for
you, Gunnison.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.676
Must be rough on you
thinking of me wearing this
cast for another whole week.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.637
That one week is
gonna cost me my
best photographer

05:04.721 --> 05:06.973
and you a big
assignment.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.057
Where?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.850
There's no point in
even talking about it.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.519
Oh, come on,
come on. Where?

05:11.603 --> 05:13.145
Kashmir.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.856
Got a code tip
from the bureau
chief this morning.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.692
The place is about
to go up in smoke.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.528
What did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you that's
the next place to watch?

05:20.612 --> 05:21.612
You did.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.031
Okay. When do I leave?
Half-hour? Hour?

05:24.116 --> 05:26.325
With that cast
on? You don't.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.661
Stop sounding stuffy.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.623
I can take pictures
from a jeep or a water
buffalo, if necessary.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.835
You're too valuable
to the magazine for
us to play around with.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.753
I'll send Morgan
or Lambert.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.755
Morgan or Lambert.
That's fine.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.967
I get myself
half-killed
for you,

05:43.051 --> 05:45.594
and you reward
me by stealing
my assignments.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.348
I didn't ask you to stand
in the middle of that
automobile racetrack.

05:49.433 --> 05:53.978
You asked for something
dramatically different.
You got it.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.480
So did you.
Goodbye, Jeff.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.026
Now wait a minute,
Gunnison. You've got
to get me out of here.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.570
Six weeks sitting in
a two-room apartment

06:02.654 --> 06:04.864
with nothing to do but
look out the window
at the neighbors.

06:04.948 --> 06:05.948
Bye, Jeff.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.366
No, Gunnison, I...

06:07.451 --> 06:10.244
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.163
I'm gonna do
something drastic.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.205
Like what?

06:13.290 --> 06:14.373
"Like what?"
I'm gonna get married.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.709
And then I'll never
be able to go anywhere.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.169
It's about time
you got married,

06:18.253 --> 06:21.547
before you turn
into a lonesome
and bitter old man.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.051
Yeah, can't you
just see me?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.095
Rushing home to
a hot apartment

06:28.180 --> 06:32.141
to listen to the
automatic laundry and
the electric dishwasher

06:32.225 --> 06:36.937
and the garbage
disposal and the
nagging wife.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.566
Jeff, wives don't nag
anymore, they discuss.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.235
Is that so?
Is that so?

06:43.320 --> 06:45.905
Well, maybe in the
high-rent district
they discuss.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.157
In my neighborhood,
they still nag.

06:48.241 --> 06:52.661
Yeah? Well, you know best.
I'll call you later, Jeff.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.748
Yeah, have some
good news the
next time, huh?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.846
Good morning.
I said,
"Good morning!"

07:51.930 --> 07:53.722
Oh, good morning.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.535
Say, I wouldn't dig
so deep if I were you.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.330
You're giving them
far too much water.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.584
Why don't
you shut up?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.088
Well!

08:28.425 --> 08:29.425
I do declare.

08:29.509 --> 08:33.345
New York State sentence
for a Peeping Tom is six
months in the workhouse.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.972
Oh, hello, Stella.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.683
And they got
no windows in
the workhouse.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.770
You know, in the old days,
they used to put your eyes
out with a red-hot poker.

08:41.855 --> 08:46.775
Any of those bikini bombshells
you're always watching
worth a red-hot poker?

08:46.860 --> 08:50.905
Oh, dear. We've become
a race of Peeping Toms.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.868
What people ought to do is
get outside their own house
and look in for a change.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.286
Yes, sir.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.496
How's that for a bit
of homespun philosophy?

08:59.581 --> 09:01.999
Reader's Digest,
April, 1939.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.251
Well, I only quote
from the best.
Yeah.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.545
You don't have to take my
temperature this morning.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.381
Quiet. See if you
can break 100.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.884
You know, I should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller

09:11.968 --> 09:14.053
instead of an
insurance-company
nurse.

09:14.137 --> 09:18.432
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

09:18.516 --> 09:22.895
You heard of that
market crash in '29?
I predicted that.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.105
Just how did you
do that, Stella?

09:25.190 --> 09:26.482
Oh, simple.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.069
I was nursing
a director of
General Motors.

09:30.153 --> 09:34.281
"Kidney ailment,"
they said.
"Nerves," I said.

09:34.366 --> 09:38.535
Then I asked myself,
"What's General Motors
got to be nervous about?"

09:39.496 --> 09:42.790
"Overproduction,"
I says. "Collapse."

09:42.874 --> 09:46.460
When General Motors
has to go to the
bathroom 10 times a day,

09:46.544 --> 09:49.088
the whole country's
ready to let go.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.424
You know, Stella,
in economics,

09:52.509 --> 09:55.219
a kidney ailment
has no relationship
to the stock market.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.470
None whatsoever.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.597
Crashed,
didn't it?

09:58.682 --> 10:01.725
I can smell
trouble right here
in this apartment.

10:01.810 --> 10:06.397
First you smash your
leg, then you get to
looking out the window,

10:06.481 --> 10:09.149
see things
you shouldn't
see. Trouble.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.403
I can see you
in court now,

10:12.487 --> 10:15.948
surrounded by a
bunch of lawyers in
double-breasted suits.

10:16.032 --> 10:21.245
You're pleading. You say,
"Judge, it was only a
little bit of innocent fun.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.331
"I love my neighbors,
like a father."

10:24.416 --> 10:26.458
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.878
"You've just given birth
to three years in Dannemora."

10:29.963 --> 10:32.631
Right now I'd welcome
trouble, you know.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.258
You've got a
hormone deficiency.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.051
How can you tell
from a thermometer?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.053
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

10:38.138 --> 10:41.598
haven't raised your
temperature one
degree in a month.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.811
Here we go.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.360
One more week.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.242
No, I think you're right.
I think there is gonna be
trouble around here.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.744
I knew it.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.120
Ooh!

11:03.204 --> 11:05.414
Do you ever
heat that stuff?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.249
Gives your circulation
something to fight.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.334
Oh, I see.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.960
What kind
of trouble?

11:10.045 --> 11:11.795
Lisa Fremont.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.088
You kidding?

11:13.173 --> 11:17.843
She's a beautiful
young girl, and you're a
reasonably healthy young man.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.219
She expects me
to marry her.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.346
That's normal.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.638
I don't want to.

11:21.723 --> 11:22.723
That's abnormal.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.434
I just... I'm not
ready for marriage.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.687
Every man's ready
for marriage when the
right girl comes along.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.690
And Lisa Fremont is
the right girl for any
man with half a brain

11:31.775 --> 11:33.192
who can get
one eye open.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.860
She's all right.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.862
What'd you do,
have a fight?
No.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.530
Father loading
up the shotgun?

11:38.615 --> 11:39.656
What?

11:39.741 --> 11:40.908
Please, Stella.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.534
It's happened
before, you know.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.161
Some of the world's
happiest marriages

11:44.245 --> 11:47.748
have started
"under the gun,"
as you might say.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.166
No, she's just not
the girl for me.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.417
Yeah, she's
only perfect.

11:50.502 --> 11:55.506
She's too perfect. She's too
talented. She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.633
She's too everything
but what I want.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.095
Is what you want
something you
can discuss?

12:01.179 --> 12:03.597
What? It's very
simple, Stella.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.768
She belongs to that
rarefied atmosphere
of Park Avenue, you know.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.021
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.148
People with sense
belong wherever
they're put.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.151
Can you imagine her
traveling around the
world with a camera bum

12:16.236 --> 12:18.320
who never has more
than a week's salary
in the bank?

12:18.405 --> 12:21.073
If she was
only ordinary.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.450
You never gonna
get married?

12:23.535 --> 12:25.994
I'll probably get
married one of
these days,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.539
but when I do, it's
gonna be to someone
who thinks of life

12:28.623 --> 12:33.293
not just as a new
dress and a
lobster dinner

12:33.378 --> 12:35.421
or latest scandal.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.507
I need a woman who's
willing to... Hold it.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.469
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.140
So the honest thing for
me to do is just call
the whole thing off.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.225
Let her find
somebody else.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.227
Yeah, I can
hear you now.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.563
"Get out of my life,
you perfectly
wonderful woman.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.314
"You're too
good for me."

12:54.399 --> 12:56.775
Look, Mr. Jefferies,
I'm not an
educated woman,

12:56.860 --> 12:58.610
but I can tell
you one thing.

12:58.695 --> 13:02.030
When a man and a
woman see each other
and like each other,

13:02.115 --> 13:06.452
they ought to come together,
wham, like a couple of taxis
on Broadway,

13:06.536 --> 13:10.747
and not sit around analyzing
each other like two
specimens in a bottle.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.959
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.169
Intelligence.

13:15.253 --> 13:19.214
Nothing has caused
the human race so much
trouble as intelligence.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.009
Modern marriage.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.636
No, we've
progressed
emotionally.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.096
Baloney.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.516
Once it was, "See somebody,
get excited, get married."

13:30.560 --> 13:34.396
Now it's, "Read a lot of
books, fence with a lot
of four-syllable words,

13:34.481 --> 13:36.231
"psychoanalyze
each other

13:36.316 --> 13:37.900
"until you can't tell
the difference between

13:37.984 --> 13:41.987
"a petting party and
a civil service exam."

13:42.071 --> 13:44.531
People have different
emotional levels...

13:44.616 --> 13:48.494
When I married Myles,
we were both a couple
of maladjusted misfits.

13:48.578 --> 13:53.999
We are still maladjusted
misfits, and we have loved
every minute of it.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.083
Well, that's
fine, Stella.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.169
Now, would
you fix me a
sandwich, please?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.462
Yes, I will.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.423
And I'll spread
a little common
sense on the bread.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.343
Lisa's loaded
to her fingertips
with love for you.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.471
I got two words
of advice for
you. Marry her.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.805
She pay you much?

14:08.890 --> 14:09.932
Oh!

14:26.783 --> 14:28.325
There.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.498
Here's
the key.
Thank you.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.175
Well, if you want
anything, just ring.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.315
Honey.
Come on.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.492
Got to carry you
over the threshold.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.100
Window shopper.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.110
How's your leg?

16:27.195 --> 16:28.570
It hurts a little.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.656
And your stomach?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.240
Empty as a football.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.828
And your love life?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.538
Not too active.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.250
Anything else
bothering you?

16:42.585 --> 16:43.877
Mmm-hmm.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.129
Who are you?

16:48.591 --> 16:52.636
Reading from top
to bottom, Lisa

16:56.140 --> 16:57.474
Carol

17:01.813 --> 17:03.105
Fremont.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.151
Is this the Lisa Fremont
who never wears the
same dress twice?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.695
Only because it's
expected of her.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.532
It's right off the
Paris plane. Do
you think it'll sell?

17:14.617 --> 17:17.202
That depends on the quote,
you know. Let's see now.

17:17.286 --> 17:22.040
There's the airplane ticket
over and import duties,
hidden taxes, profit markup...

17:22.125 --> 17:24.084
A steal at $1, 100.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.502
Eleven hundred?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.047
They ought to list
that dress on the
stock exchange.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.175
Why, we sell a
dozen a day in
this price range.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.719
Who buys them,
tax collectors?

17:33.803 --> 17:37.264
Even if I had to pay,
it would be worth it.
Just for the occasion.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.474
Why, is something big
going on somewhere?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.352
It's going on
right here.
It's a big night.

17:42.437 --> 17:47.774
It's just an old
run-of-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.

17:47.859 --> 17:52.904
It's opening night of
the last depressing week
of L.B. Jefferies in a cast.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.575
Well, I haven't
noticed a big demand
for tickets or anything.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.453
That's because I
bought out the house.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.330
You know, this
cigarette box has
seen better days.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.960
I picked that up in
Shanghai, which has
also seen better days.

18:07.044 --> 18:11.339
It's cracked and
you never use it.
It's too ornate.

18:11.424 --> 18:15.302
I'm sending up a plain,
flat, silver one with
just your initials engraved.

18:15.386 --> 18:18.054
That's no way
to spend your
hard-earned money.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.556
Well, I wanted to.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.391
Oh!

18:23.311 --> 18:26.396
What would you think
of starting off
with dinner at '21 '?

18:26.481 --> 18:29.024
You have, perhaps, an
ambulance downstairs?

18:29.108 --> 18:32.694
No, better
than that. '21.'

18:37.116 --> 18:40.702
Thank you for waiting,
Carl. The kitchen's
right there on the left.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.537
Oh, I'll take
the wine.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.042
Good evening,
Mr. Jefferies.
Carl.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.753
Just put everything
in the oven,
Carl, on low.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.463
Yes, madam.
Let's open
the wine now.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.923
All right.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.133
It's a
Montrachet.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.386
A great big glassful.
There's a corkscrew
right over there.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.848
Here, I'll do it.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.601
Big enough?

19:04.685 --> 19:06.144
Yeah, they're fine.

19:06.229 --> 19:10.065
I can't think of anything
more boring or tiresome than
what you've been through,

19:10.191 --> 19:11.942
and the last week
must be the hardest.
Let me, sir.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.610
All right.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.780
Yeah, I want to
get this thing off
and get moving.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.408
Well, I'm going to
make this a week
you'll never forget.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.913
Fine, thanks.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.290
Just a
minute, Carl.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.334
This will take care
of the taxi as well.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.627
Thank you,
Miss Fremont.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.212
Have a
pleasant dinner,
Mr. Jefferies.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.589
All right.
Good night.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.091
Good night.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.845
What a day
I've had.

19:39.929 --> 19:40.887
Are you tired?

19:40.972 --> 19:42.055
Not a bit.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.307
I was all morning
in a sales meeting,

19:44.392 --> 19:47.894
then I had to dash to the
Waldorf for a quick drink
with Madame Dufresne,

19:47.979 --> 19:51.147
who's just over
from Paris with
some spy reports.

19:52.316 --> 19:56.278
And then I had to go to '21 '
and have lunch with the
Harper's Bazaar people.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.363
And that's when
I ordered dinner.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.199
Then I had two
fall showings
20 blocks apart.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.869
Then I had to have
a cocktail with Leland
and Slim Hayward.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.662
We're trying to
get his new show.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.789
And then I had to
dash back and change.

20:07.874 --> 20:12.419
Well, now, tell me.
Tell me. Now, what was
Mrs. Hayward wearing?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.379
Oh, she looked
wonderfully cool.
She did.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.340
She had on the most
divine Italian hand-print

20:17.466 --> 20:19.426
mousseline
de soie...
Oh, Italian?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.553
Oh, you.
Italian. Imagine.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.098
To think I planted
three nice items in the
columns about you today.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.182
You did?

20:26.267 --> 20:27.726
You can't buy that
kind of publicity.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.394
I know.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.356
Someday you may want
to open up a studio
of your own here.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.110
How would I run it
from, say, Pakistan?

20:37.820 --> 20:39.446
Jeff...

20:40.489 --> 20:44.743
Isn't it time you
came home? You could
pick your assignment.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.662
I wish there
was one I wanted.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.997
Make the one
you want.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.916
You mean leave
the magazine?
Yes.

20:51.000 --> 20:51.958
For what?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.919
For yourself
and me.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.297
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.343
Don't laugh.
I could do it.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.219
That's what
I'm afraid of.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.556
Can you see me driving
down to the fashion
salon in a jeep,

21:06.641 --> 21:09.768
wearing combat boots
and a three-day beard?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.227
Wouldn't that
make a hit?

21:11.354 --> 21:15.982
I could see you looking very
handsome and successful
in a dark blue flannel suit.

21:16.067 --> 21:19.653
Let's stop talking
nonsense, shall we?

21:19.737 --> 21:20.820
Hmm?

21:23.449 --> 21:26.451
Guess I'd better start
setting up for dinner.

21:35.795 --> 21:41.299
To see you is to love you

21:42.218 --> 21:47.055
And I see you everywhere

21:48.015 --> 21:52.852
In the sunrise
In the moon glow

21:54.021 --> 21:58.108
Any place I look you're there

21:59.777 --> 22:04.906
To see you is to want you

22:05.700 --> 22:10.078
And I see you all the time

22:11.288 --> 22:15.500
On a sidewalk
In a doorway

22:16.752 --> 22:21.423
On the lonely stairs I climb

22:23.259 --> 22:27.512
Someday let me show you

22:27.888 --> 22:32.350
How happy endings start

22:33.102 --> 22:38.606
You'll find how well
I know you

22:39.483 --> 22:43.028
'Cause to know you at all

22:43.112 --> 22:46.740
Is to know you by heart

22:47.992 --> 22:53.788
To see you is to love you

22:54.248 --> 22:59.461
And you're never out of sight

22:59.962 --> 23:05.133
And I love you
and I'll see you

23:06.093 --> 23:10.555
In the same old dream

23:10.639 --> 23:16.102
Tonight

23:30.826 --> 23:32.494
Miss Lonelyheart.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.413
At least that's
something you'll never
have to worry about.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.082
Oh?

23:37.166 --> 23:41.044
You can see my apartment
from here, all the way up
on 63rd Street?

23:41.128 --> 23:44.297
No, not exactly,
but we have a
little apartment here

23:44.381 --> 23:46.591
that's probably about
as popular as yours.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.261
You remember,
of course, Miss Torso,
the ballet dancer?

23:51.305 --> 23:54.557
She's like a queen bee
with her pick
of the drones.

24:04.235 --> 24:07.987
I'd say she's doing
a woman's hardest job.
Juggling wolves.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.371
Thank you.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.302
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.472
She's not in
love with him
or any of them.

24:34.557 --> 24:37.142
Oh, how can you
tell that from here?

24:38.227 --> 24:41.437
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

24:57.746 --> 25:00.081
I hope they're
cooked this time.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.919
Where's that wonderful
music coming from?

26:28.003 --> 26:31.256
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.715
Wow!

26:32.800 --> 26:36.844
He lives alone. Probably
had a very unhappy marriage.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.348
Oh, it's enchanting.

26:43.644 --> 26:47.272
It's almost as if it
were being written
especially for us.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.398
Hmm.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.484
No wonder he's
having so much
trouble with it.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.823
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.034
Lisa, it's perfect.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.538
As always.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.802
There can't be that much
difference between people
and the way they live.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.346
We all eat, talk,
drink, laugh,
wear clothes.

27:20.431 --> 27:21.889
Well, now look...

27:21.974 --> 27:24.809
If you're saying all this
because you don't want
to tell me the truth,

27:24.893 --> 27:27.228
because you're hiding
something from me, then
maybe I can understand.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.980
I'm not hiding
anything. It's
just that...

27:29.064 --> 27:30.440
It doesn't
make sense.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.651
What's so different about
it here from over there
or anyplace you go

27:33.736 --> 27:36.321
that one person
couldn't live in both
places just as easily?

27:36.405 --> 27:37.989
Some people
can. Now, if
you'll just let me...

27:38.073 --> 27:41.409
What is it but traveling
from one place to
another, taking pictures?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.661
It's just like being
a tourist on an
endless vacation.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.079
Okay. Now
that's your opinion.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.998
You're entitled
to it. Now, let me
give you my side.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.125
It's ridiculous
to say that it
can only be done

27:49.209 --> 27:52.253
by a special,
private little group
of anointed people.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.298
I made a simple
statement, a
true statement,

27:55.382 --> 27:58.885
but I can back it
up if you'd just
shut up for a minute.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.305
If your opinion is as rude
as your manner, I don't
think I care to hear it.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.806
Oh, come on now.
Simmer down.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.185
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.521
I mean, according to you,
people should be born, live
and die on the same spot!

28:10.606 --> 28:11.814
Shut up!

28:14.568 --> 28:16.944
Did you ever eat
fish heads and rice?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.654
Of course not.

28:18.739 --> 28:21.282
Well, you might have
to if you went with me.

28:21.367 --> 28:27.121
Did you ever try to keep warm
in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,
20 degrees below zero?

28:27.206 --> 28:30.375
Oh, I do it all the
time. Whenever I have
a few minutes after lunch.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.919
Did you ever get shot at?
Did you ever get run over?

28:33.003 --> 28:34.420
Did you ever get
sandbagged at night

28:34.505 --> 28:37.799
because somebody got
unfavorable publicity
from your camera?

28:37.883 --> 28:40.676
Did you ever... Those
high heels, they'll be
great in the jungle.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.929
And the nylons and
those six-ounce lingerie.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.555
Three.
All right, three.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.059
They'll make a big hit
in Finland, just before
you freeze to death.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.729
Well, if there's one
thing I know, it's how to
wear the proper clothes.

28:51.814 --> 28:52.980
Yeah, yeah.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.609
Well, try and find
a raincoat in Brazil,
even when it isn't raining.

28:56.693 --> 29:00.321
Lisa, in this job
you carry one suitcase.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.907
Your home is
the available
transportation.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.159
You don't sleep very
much. You bathe less.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.286
And sometimes
the food that
you eat

29:07.371 --> 29:11.124
is made from things that
you couldn't even look
at when they're alive.

29:11.208 --> 29:15.002
Jeff, you don't have to be
deliberately repulsive just
to impress me I'm wrong.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.423
Deliberately repulsive?
I'm just trying to make
it sound good.

29:18.507 --> 29:21.759
You just have to face it,
Lisa, you're not meant
for that kind of a life.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.553
Few people are.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.889
You're too stubborn
to argue with.

29:26.974 --> 29:30.435
I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.

29:30.519 --> 29:34.397
I know, a lesser man
would have told me
it was one long holiday,

29:34.481 --> 29:38.192
and I would have
been awakened to
a rude disillusionment.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.570
Oh, well now,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

29:40.654 --> 29:45.491
If you want to get vicious
on this thing, I'd be very
happy to accommodate you.

29:46.869 --> 29:49.745
No, I don't
particularly
want that.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.624
So that's it?

29:53.709 --> 29:56.836
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.046
It would be
the wrong thing.

30:01.216 --> 30:05.219
You don't think
either one of us
could ever change?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.513
Right now it
doesn't seem so.

30:12.603 --> 30:16.397
I'm in love with you.
I don't care what
you do for a living.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.359
I'd just like to be
part of it somehow.

30:22.613 --> 30:25.573
It's deflating to find
out the only way
I can be part of it

30:25.657 --> 30:28.784
is to take out
a subscription
to your magazine.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.122
I guess I'm not
the girl
I thought I was.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.208
There's nothing
wrong with
you, Lisa.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.294
You've got this
town in the palm
of your hand.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.923
Not quite,
it seems.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.718
Goodbye, Jeff.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.011
You mean
good night.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.471
I mean
what I said.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.933
Well, Lisa,
couldn't we just...

30:52.226 --> 30:53.601
Uh...

30:53.977 --> 30:58.064
Couldn't we
just keep things
status quo?

31:00.901 --> 31:02.527
Without any future?

31:02.611 --> 31:04.987
When am I gonna
see you again?

31:06.615 --> 31:08.533
Not for a
long time.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.744
At least

31:11.828 --> 31:13.871
not until tomorrow night.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.118
Don't!

32:17.144 --> 32:18.519
Hey! Rain.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.985
Grab that. The rest
of the blanket. Wait,
I'll get the clock.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.403
Oh, no!

32:30.365 --> 32:31.616
Put it in, now.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.912
Pull on it.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.956
Let me do it.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.708
In you go.

34:57.179 --> 35:00.681
No, you can't
come in. It's
much too late.

35:00.766 --> 35:05.102
No, no, not now. Get your
foot out of the way.
No, I said good night.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.788
What's that
supposed to be,
ma'am?

36:47.873 --> 36:49.874
It's called
"Hunger."

37:13.315 --> 37:16.191
You'd think the
rain would have
cooled things off.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.443
All it did was
make the heat wet.

37:17.527 --> 37:18.569
That's it.
That's it.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.654
That's stiff one,
right there.
Right there.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.157
You know, the
insurance company
would be much happier

37:23.241 --> 37:26.285
if you'd sleep in bed
at night instead of
in that wheelchair.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.453
How'd you know?

37:27.537 --> 37:29.204
Eyes are
all bloodshot.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.248
Must have been
watching out that
window for hours.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.791
Yeah, I was.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.460
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

37:34.544 --> 37:36.086
It depends
which one.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.671
Miss Torso,
for example...

37:37.756 --> 37:39.924
You keep your
mind off her.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.468
She sure is the "Eat,
drink and be merry" girl.

37:42.552 --> 37:45.721
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.097
Yeah.

37:47.182 --> 37:53.312
Speaking of misery, poor
Miss Lonelyheart. She drank
herself to sleep again, alone.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.606
Poor soul.
Oh, well.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.691
Maybe one day she'll
find her happiness.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.611
Yeah, and some man
will lose his.

38:00.695 --> 38:04.281
Isn't there anybody in the
neighborhood who could cast
an eye in her direction?

38:04.366 --> 38:05.741
I don't know.

38:05.825 --> 38:09.536
It just might be
that the salesman
will be available soon.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.497
Oh, him and his wife
splitting up?

38:11.581 --> 38:13.290
I just can't
figure it.

38:13.375 --> 38:18.045
He went out several times
last night in the rain,
carrying his sample case.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.338
Well, he's a
salesman, isn't he?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.799
What would he be selling
at 3:00 in the morning?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.300
Flashlights.

38:23.385 --> 38:27.554
Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.849
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.978
I think he was
taking something
out of the apartment.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.062
Uh-huh.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.148
His personal effects.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.610
He's gonna run out
on her, the coward.

38:41.695 --> 38:43.153
Yeah.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.906
Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

38:45.991 --> 38:50.828
Yeah, well, it takes a
particularly low type of man
to do a thing like that.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.624
How about this morning?
Any further developments?

38:56.668 --> 38:58.752
The shades are all
drawn in the apartment.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.879
In this heat?
Yeah.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.798
Well, they're
up now.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.014
Get back!
Get back!

39:10.098 --> 39:11.348
Where do you
want me to go?

39:11.433 --> 39:12.725
Come on, get
out of sight.
Get out of sight.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.226
What is it?
What's the matter?

39:14.310 --> 39:17.021
That salesman's
looking out of his
window. You see?

39:17.105 --> 39:19.064
Get back!
He'll see you.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.608
I'm not shy.
I've been
looked at before.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.652
That's no
ordinary look.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.031
That's the kind
of look a man gives

39:27.115 --> 39:30.284
when he's afraid
somebody might
be watching him.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.428
Get away from there.
Get away from there.
He'll be after you.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.722
Go on, into the house.
Into the house.

39:54.517 --> 39:57.311
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.645
Uh-huh.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.364
And don't sleep in
that chair again.

40:09.449 --> 40:10.407
Uh-huh.

40:10.492 --> 40:11.700
"Uh-huh.
Uh-huh."

40:11.951 --> 40:13.952
Great conversationalist.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.664
Stella.

40:18.792 --> 40:22.628
Take those binoculars
out of the case and bring
them here, will you?

40:22.712 --> 40:25.547
Trouble.
I can smell it.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.676
I'll be glad when
they crack that cast,
and I can get out of here.

40:29.761 --> 40:30.928
Uh-huh.

44:07.270 --> 44:10.522
How far does a girl
have to go before
you'll notice her?

44:10.606 --> 44:14.651
Well, if she's pretty
enough, she doesn't
have to go anywhere.

44:14.736 --> 44:16.945
She just has to "be."

44:17.030 --> 44:18.071
Well, ain't I?

44:18.823 --> 44:20.657
Pay attention to me.

44:23.202 --> 44:26.788
I'm not exactly
on the other
side of the room.

44:27.248 --> 44:28.832
Your mind is...

44:29.751 --> 44:32.586
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.675
Don't you ever
have any problems?

44:38.760 --> 44:40.385
I have one now.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.180
So do I.

44:44.766 --> 44:46.641
Tell me about it.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.103
Why...

44:51.356 --> 44:57.027
Why would a man leave his
apartment three times on
a rainy night with a suitcase,

44:57.111 --> 44:59.863
and come back
three times?

44:59.947 --> 45:01.782
He likes the way his
wife welcomes him home.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.784
No, no. No, no.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.870
No, no. Not this
salesman's wife.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.955
And why didn't he
go to work today?

45:09.040 --> 45:11.375
Homework. It's
more interesting.

45:14.045 --> 45:17.547
What's interesting
about a butcher knife

45:17.632 --> 45:20.050
and a small saw

45:20.134 --> 45:22.552
wrapped in newspaper?
Hmm?

45:22.637 --> 45:25.222
Nothing,
thank heaven.

45:25.306 --> 45:28.183
Why hasn't he been
in his wife's
bedroom all day?

45:28.309 --> 45:30.435
I wouldn't dare
answer that.

45:31.813 --> 45:37.275
Well, listen. I'll
answer it, Lisa. There's
something terribly wrong.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.447
And I'm afraid
it's with me.

45:42.532 --> 45:43.532
What do you think?

45:44.992 --> 45:47.494
Something too
frightful to utter.

45:49.122 --> 45:53.333
He went out a few minutes
ago in his undershirt,
hasn't come back yet.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.682
That'd be a
terrible job
to tackle.

46:14.647 --> 46:17.732
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

46:20.194 --> 46:24.406
Jeff, I'll be honest
with you. You're beginning
to scare me a little.

46:26.868 --> 46:29.119
Jeff, did you hear
what I said? You're
beginning to scare...

46:29.203 --> 46:31.204
Shh! Shh!

46:31.289 --> 46:32.998
He's coming back!

47:00.860 --> 47:02.777
Jeff, if you could
only see yourself!

47:02.862 --> 47:03.862
What's the matter?

47:03.946 --> 47:06.531
Sitting around
looking out of the window
to kill time is one thing,

47:06.616 --> 47:10.702
but doing it the way
you are, with binoculars
and wild opinions

47:10.786 --> 47:13.413
about every
little thing you
see, is diseased!

47:13.498 --> 47:16.166
What, do you think I
consider it recreation?

47:16.250 --> 47:18.001
I don't know what
you consider it,

47:18.085 --> 47:20.170
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.338
What's the...

47:21.422 --> 47:22.797
What is it you're
looking for?

47:22.882 --> 47:25.675
I just want to find out
what's the matter with the
salesman's wife, that's all.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.427
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

47:27.512 --> 47:29.346
What makes you think
there's something
the matter with her?

47:29.430 --> 47:33.016
A lot of things.
She's an invalid. She
demands constant care.

47:33.100 --> 47:37.354
Yet neither the husband
or anybody else has been
in to see her all day. Why?

47:39.106 --> 47:40.440
Maybe she died.

47:40.525 --> 47:43.193
Where's the doctor?
Where's the undertaker?

47:43.277 --> 47:46.154
She could
be sleeping,
under sedatives.

47:46.239 --> 47:49.074
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

47:49.158 --> 47:51.660
There is something...
I've seen it
through that window.

47:51.744 --> 47:54.579
I've seen bickering
and family quarrels

47:54.664 --> 47:57.916
and mysterious trips
at night and knives
and saws and ropes.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.876
And now,
since last evening,
not a sign of the wife.

47:59.961 --> 48:01.336
All right.
Now you tell me
where she is.

48:01.462 --> 48:03.380
I don't know.
What's she doing?
Where is she?

48:03.464 --> 48:06.424
Maybe he's leaving
his wife. I don't know.
I don't care!

48:06.509 --> 48:09.636
Lots of people have
knives and saws and
ropes around their houses.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.681
And lots of men
don't speak to
their wives all day.

48:12.765 --> 48:15.350
Lots of wives nag
and men hate them
and trouble starts,

48:15.434 --> 48:19.563
but very, very few of them
end up in murder, if that's
what you're thinking.

48:19.647 --> 48:21.982
It's pretty hard for
you to keep away
from that word, isn't it?

48:22.108 --> 48:24.776
You could see all that
he did, couldn't you?
Of course...

48:24.860 --> 48:26.486
You could see
because the shades
were up

48:26.571 --> 48:29.864
and he walked along
the corridor and the street
and the backyard.

48:29.949 --> 48:31.324
I've seen him
in the backyard,
fixing the flowers...

48:31.409 --> 48:34.411
Oh, Jeff, do you think
a murderer would
let you see all that?

48:34.495 --> 48:37.205
That he wouldn't
pull the shades down
and hide behind them?

48:37.290 --> 48:39.416
Just where he's being
clever. He's being
nonchalant about it.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.334
And that's
where you're
not being clever.

48:41.419 --> 48:45.255
A murderer would never
parade his crime in
front of an open window.

48:45.339 --> 48:46.423
Why not?

48:46.507 --> 48:47.507
Why, for all
you know,

48:47.592 --> 48:50.760
there's probably something
a lot more sinister going
on behind those windows.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.095
Where?

48:52.179 --> 48:53.263
Oh!

48:55.808 --> 48:57.225
No comment.

49:19.832 --> 49:23.418
Let's start from
the beginning
again, Jeff.

49:23.502 --> 49:26.880
Tell me everything
you saw

49:26.964 --> 49:29.758
and what you
think it means.

49:42.229 --> 49:43.229
Yeah?

49:43.314 --> 49:44.397
The name
on the second floor

49:44.482 --> 49:47.984
rear mail box reads,
"Mr. And Mrs. Lars."

49:48.069 --> 49:50.445
That's L-A-R-S.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.489
Lars Thorwald.

49:52.573 --> 49:54.240
What's the number of
the apartment house?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.868
125 West
9th Street.

49:58.079 --> 49:59.496
Thank you, dear.

49:59.580 --> 50:01.831
Okay, chief.
What's my next
assignment?

50:01.916 --> 50:02.916
Just go home.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.711
All right,
but what's
he doing now?

50:06.796 --> 50:10.256
He's just sitting
in the living room
in the dark.

50:11.050 --> 50:13.593
Hasn't gone
near the bedroom.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.345
Now you go home
and get some sleep.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.389
Good night.
Good night.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.566
All right.
What's it all about, Jeff?

50:28.651 --> 50:31.986
Now look, Doyle, it's
just something I can't tell
you over the telephone.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.947
You have to be here
and see the whole setup.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.031
Important, huh?

50:35.116 --> 50:36.616
Well, it's probably
nothing important at all.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.785
It's just a little
neighborhood murder,
that's all.

50:38.869 --> 50:39.869
Did you say
"murder," Jeff?

50:39.954 --> 50:41.579
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder."

50:41.664 --> 50:43.039
Oh, come now.

50:43.124 --> 50:46.459
My only thought was
throwing a little business
your way, that's all.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.504
I figured a good detective
would jump at the chance of
something to detect.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.214
I'm not
working.
What?

50:51.298 --> 50:52.966
This happens to
be my day off.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.010
Well, I usually took
my best pictures
on my day off.

50:56.137 --> 50:57.178
I'll drop by.

50:57.263 --> 50:59.889
Okay, Doyle. All right.
As soon as you can.

51:01.308 --> 51:05.103
Bless your heart,
Stella. Gee whiz,
look at this.

51:05.187 --> 51:07.147
I can't tell you
what a welcome
sight this is.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.232
No wonder
your husband
still loves you.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.900
The police.
What?

51:10.985 --> 51:11.985
You called
the police.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.987
Well, not exactly.

51:14.071 --> 51:17.782
Not an official call.
It's just an old
friend of mine.

51:17.867 --> 51:20.910
An old, ornery
friend of mine.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.830
Just where do you
suppose he cut her up?

51:25.499 --> 51:28.001
Of course.
The bathtub.

51:28.878 --> 51:32.922
That's the only
place where he could have
washed away the blood.

51:41.807 --> 51:45.685
He better get that
trunk out of there
before it starts to leak.

52:07.208 --> 52:08.625
Harry?

52:14.006 --> 52:16.049
Look, look,
Mr. Jefferies.

52:53.754 --> 52:56.005
I thought Doyle would
be here by the
time the trunk left,

52:56.090 --> 52:58.550
or I'd have called
the police. Now
we're gonna lose it.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.218
Hold everything.
Don't do
anything foolish.

53:00.302 --> 53:02.136
I'm just gonna
get the name off
that freight truck.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.472
I'll keep
an eye on
the alley.

53:18.028 --> 53:19.654
Long distance.

53:44.805 --> 53:48.391
You didn't see the killing
or the body. How do you
know there was a murder?

53:48.475 --> 53:51.519
Because everything
this fellow's done
has been suspicious.

53:51.604 --> 53:55.356
Trips at night in the rain,
and knives and saws
and trunks with rope

53:55.441 --> 53:57.692
and now this
wife that isn't
there anymore.

53:57.776 --> 54:02.572
I admit it all has a
mysterious sound. It could
be any number of things.

54:02.656 --> 54:03.990
Murder's the
least plausible.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.492
Doyle, don't
tell me he's an
unemployed magician,

54:06.577 --> 54:09.579
amusing the neighborhood
with his sleight of hand.
Don't tell me that.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.081
It's too obvious
and stupid a way
to commit murder.

54:12.166 --> 54:13.791
In full view
of 50 windows?

54:13.876 --> 54:15.084
Then sit over there
smoking a cigar,

54:15.169 --> 54:16.753
waiting for the police
to come and pick him up?

54:16.837 --> 54:19.255
All right, Officer,
do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

54:19.340 --> 54:22.592
Jeff, you've got
a lot to learn
about homicide.

54:22.676 --> 54:24.886
Why, morons have
committed murder
so shrewdly,

54:24.970 --> 54:28.222
it's taken a hundred
trained police minds
to catch them.

54:28.307 --> 54:30.934
That salesman wouldn't
just knock his
wife off after dinner

54:31.018 --> 54:33.519
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

54:33.604 --> 54:34.938
I'll bet it's
been done.

54:35.022 --> 54:38.232
Most everything's
been done, under panic.

54:38.317 --> 54:40.401
This is a
thousand-to-one
shot.

54:40.486 --> 54:43.780
He's still sitting around
the apartment. That man's
not panicked.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.949
You think I
made all this up?

54:46.033 --> 54:47.951
Well, I think
you saw something.

54:48.035 --> 54:50.662
There's probably
a very simple
explanation for that.

54:50.746 --> 54:52.288
For instance?

54:52.373 --> 54:53.915
Wife took a trip.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.000
His wife was
sick in bed.

54:57.461 --> 54:59.253
Yeah, so
you told me.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.299
Well, Jeff, I've
got to run along.

55:04.551 --> 55:09.806
I won't report this to the
department. Let me poke
into it a little on my own.

55:09.890 --> 55:12.642
No sense in your
getting a lot of
ridiculous publicity.

55:12.726 --> 55:14.060
Thank you.

55:16.271 --> 55:19.232
We know the wife is
gone, so I'll see if I
can find out where.

55:19.316 --> 55:20.566
Do that.

55:21.777 --> 55:24.278
You had any
headaches lately?

55:24.363 --> 55:25.738
Not until you
showed up.

55:26.782 --> 55:29.784
It'll wear off, along
with the hallucinations.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.452
See you around.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.311
Get along.

56:18.584 --> 56:20.084
He has a
six months' lease.

56:20.169 --> 56:23.129
Used up a little
more than five and
a half months of it.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.631
He's quiet, drinks,
but not to drunkenness.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.634
Pays his bills promptly
with money earned as a
costume jewelry salesman.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.053
Wholesale.

56:30.304 --> 56:33.431
Kept to himself. None
of his neighbors got
close to him or his wife.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.349
Yeah, well, I think
they missed their
chance with her.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.434
She never left
the apartment...

56:36.477 --> 56:38.269
Where is she?
The icebox?
...until yesterday morning.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.730
What time?
6:00 a.m.

56:40.814 --> 56:42.148
6:00 a.m.

56:43.192 --> 56:45.985
I think that's about
the time I fell asleep.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.320
Too bad.

56:47.654 --> 56:51.491
Thorwalds were
leaving their apartment
at just that time.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.535
Feel a little foolish?

56:54.953 --> 56:56.496
No, not yet.

57:08.133 --> 57:09.926
How's your wife?

57:10.010 --> 57:11.177
Oh, she's fine.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.891
Who said
they left then?

57:17.518 --> 57:18.518
Who left where?

57:18.602 --> 57:20.686
The Thorwalds,
at 6:00 in the morning.

57:20.771 --> 57:23.439
Oh, the building
superintendent
and two tenants.

57:23.524 --> 57:26.567
Flat statements,
no hesitation. They jived
with the letter.

57:26.652 --> 57:29.070
Thorwalds were on
their way to the
railroad station.

57:29.154 --> 57:32.698
Well, now, Tom,
how could anybody
possibly guess that?

57:32.783 --> 57:36.911
What, did they have signs
on their luggage, saying,
"Grand Central or bust?"

57:36.995 --> 57:39.747
The superintendent
met Thorwald
on his way back.

57:39.832 --> 57:42.959
Thorwald told him
that he'd put his wife
on a train to the country.

57:43.043 --> 57:46.212
I see. I'd say this is
a pretty convenient guy,
this superintendent.

57:46.296 --> 57:49.215
Have you
checked his bank
statements lately?

57:50.384 --> 57:51.467
Huh?

57:51.552 --> 57:54.095
Well, what good's
his information?

57:54.179 --> 57:56.556
It's a secondhand version
of an unsupported story

57:56.640 --> 57:58.391
by the murderer
himself, Thorwald.

57:58.475 --> 58:02.019
Now did anybody
actually see the wife
get on the train?

58:03.021 --> 58:03.980
I hate to
remind you,

58:04.064 --> 58:06.858
but this all started
because you said
she was murdered.

58:06.942 --> 58:10.069
Now, did anyone,
including you, actually
see her murdered?

58:10.154 --> 58:11.988
What are you doing?

58:12.072 --> 58:16.117
Are you interested in
solving this case or in
making me look foolish?

58:16.201 --> 58:18.327
Well, if possible, both.

58:18.412 --> 58:19.912
Well, then, do a
good job of it.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.873
Go over there and
search Thorwald's
apartment.

58:21.957 --> 58:23.833
It must be
knee-deep
in evidence.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.376
I can't do that.

58:25.460 --> 58:27.712
Well, no, I don't mean
right now, but when he
goes out for a drink,

58:27.796 --> 58:30.047
or a paper, or something.
What he doesn't know
won't hurt him.

58:30.132 --> 58:32.508
I can't do that,
even if he
isn't there.

58:32.593 --> 58:37.346
What's he... Does he have a
courtesy card from the police
department, or something?

58:37.431 --> 58:39.265
Now don't
get me mad.

58:39.474 --> 58:42.602
Not even a detective
can walk into an
apartment and search it.

58:42.686 --> 58:45.771
If I were caught in
there, they'd have my
badge within 10 minutes.

58:45.856 --> 58:48.357
All right. Make sure
you don't get caught,
that's all.

58:48.442 --> 58:50.693
What? If you find
something, you've
got a murderer,

58:50.777 --> 58:52.862
and they don't care
anything about a
couple of house rules.

58:52.946 --> 58:55.031
If you don't find
anything, the
fellow's clear.

58:55.115 --> 58:59.535
At the risk of sounding
stuffy, I'd like to remind
you of the Constitution

58:59.620 --> 59:02.496
and the phrase,
"Search warrant
issued by a judge

59:02.581 --> 59:04.624
"who knows his Bill
of Rights verbatim."

59:04.708 --> 59:06.292
He must ask for evidence.

59:06.376 --> 59:07.710
Give him evidence.

59:09.588 --> 59:11.505
Yeah, I can
hear myself.

59:11.590 --> 59:15.635
"Your Honor, I
have a friend who's
an amateur sleuth.

59:16.637 --> 59:20.389
"Well, the other
night after having
a heavy dinner, he..."

59:20.474 --> 59:22.934
He'd throw the
New York State penal
code right in my face.

59:23.018 --> 59:25.061
And there's
six volumes.

59:25.812 --> 59:28.522
You know, by tomorrow
morning there may not
be any evidence left

59:28.607 --> 59:30.733
over in that apartment.
You know that.

59:30.817 --> 59:33.110
It's a detective's
nightmare.

59:33.528 --> 59:35.905
What do you need
before you can search?

59:35.989 --> 59:37.198
Tell me. Now,
what do you need?

59:37.282 --> 59:39.784
Bloody footsteps
leading up
to the door?

59:39.868 --> 59:43.537
One thing I don't need
is heckling. You called
me and asked for help.

59:43.622 --> 59:46.165
Now you're behaving
like a taxpayer.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.918
How did we ever
stand each other
in that plane

59:49.002 --> 59:51.003
for three years
during the war?

59:53.340 --> 59:56.300
I guess I'll go over to
the railroad station and
check on Thorwald's story.

59:56.385 --> 59:58.094
Oh, forget
about the story.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.846
Find the trunk.
Mrs. Thorwald's in it.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.431
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.893
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.146
mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.315
That's 80 miles
north of here.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.194
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.737
"Love, Anna."

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:20.574
Oh...

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.034
Is that...

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.496
Anna... Is that
who I think it is?

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.207
Mrs. Thorwald.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.005
Oh, so anything
you need, Jeff?

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.924
You might send me
a good detective.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:52.893
Many dreams ago

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:58.357
I dreamed many dreams

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:05.573
Waiting for my true love

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:09.952
To appear

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:16.584
Though each night it seems

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:22.256
Someone filled my dreams

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.092
Still the face

01:03:25.177 --> 01:03:30.556
That I kissed wasn't clear

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:39.106
So I let my heart dance

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:44.570
To many sweet refrains

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:49.742
But now just one song

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:55.915
And just one dream remains

01:03:56.124 --> 01:04:00.127
That one song is you

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:06.008
And at last I know

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:10.930
You're the one I dreamed of

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:15.434
Many dreams ago

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.986
Hello?
Hello, Miss Doyle?

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.029
Yes?

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.697
This is Jeff again.
Has Tom come in yet?

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:29.740
Not yet, Jeff.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.825
You mean you haven't
even heard from him?

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.412
Not a word. Is
it something really
important, Jeff?

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:37.164
Yeah, I'm afraid
it is, Tess.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:39.250
I'll have him call
the moment I
hear from him.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:40.709
No, no, don't
bother to do that.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:43.379
Just have him get
over here as
soon as he can.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.172
Looks like Thorwald's
pulling out tonight.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:46.215
Who's Thorwald?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.424
He'll know,
he'll know.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:50.219
And Thorwald's
a man, Tess,
don't worry.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.680
Good night,
you idiot.
Good night.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.282
Long distance again.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.153
There's somebody
at the door.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.534
Hi.
Hello.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.058
Hello.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:23.687
What'd you
do to your hair?

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:25.481
Oh, well,
I just sort of...
Take a look at Thorwald.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:29.026
He's getting ready
to pull out for good.
Look at him.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:33.989
He doesn't seem
to be in any hurry.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:36.575
He's been laying
out all his things
on one of the beds.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.911
Shirts, suits,
coats, socks.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.121
Even his wife's...
That alligator handbag

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.540
his wife had
on the bedpost.
What about it?

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.377
He had it hidden
in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:50.381
He took it out, went to
the telephone and made
a long-distance call.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:53.175
He had his
wife's jewelry
in the handbag.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.301
Seemed worried
about it.

01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:56.178
Asked somebody's
advice over
the telephone.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:57.888
Someone not his wife.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.140
Well, I never saw
him ask her for advice.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:04.061
She volunteered plenty,
but I never saw him
ask her for any.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.823
I wonder where
he's going.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.241
I don't know.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.702
Suppose he
doesn't come
back again?

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.413
He'll be back.
His things are
still there.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.541
Well, I guess it's safe
to put on some lights now.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.126
No, not yet!

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:38.554
Okay, you can turn it on
now. He must have gone
someplace to the right.

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:43.016
All day long, I've
been trying to keep
my mind on my work.

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.727
Thinking about Thorwald?

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.979
And you and your
friend, Doyle.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.481
Did you hear
from him again,
since he left?

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.566
Not a word.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.235
He said he was gonna
check the railroad
station and the trunk.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.195
He must be
still at it.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:57.823
Something on
your mind?

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.075
It doesn't make
sense to me.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.618
What doesn't?

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.496
Women aren't that
unpredictable.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:05.998
Mmm.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.209
Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.670
A woman has a
favorite handbag

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:15.883
and it always hangs on
her bedpost, where she
can get at it easily.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:19.970
And then, all of a sudden,
she goes away on a trip
and leaves it behind. Why?

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:21.721
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.807
And where she's
going, she wouldn't
need the handbag.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:26.769
Yes, but only
her husband
would know that.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.270
And that jewelry.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.148
Women don't keep their
jewelry in a purse

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.734
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.402
Well, do they
hide it in their
husband's clothes?

01:08:35.487 --> 01:08:37.069
They do not.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.865
And they
don't leave it
behind, either.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.326
Why, a woman
going anywhere
but the hospital

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.412
would always take
makeup, perfume
and jewelry.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.874
Put that over
there. That's
inside stuff, huh?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.584
It's basic
equipment.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.545
And you don't leave
it behind in your
husband's drawer

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.087
in your favorite handbag.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.466
Well, I'm with you,
sweetie. I'm with you.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.510
Tom Doyle has
a pat answer
for that, though.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.553
That Mrs. Thorwald
left at 6:00 a.m.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:02.720
Yesterday with
her husband?

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.473
According to
those witnesses.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.809
Well, I have a pat
rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.729
That couldn't have
been Mrs. Thorwald,
or I don't know women.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.856
What about
the witnesses?

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:15.192
We'll agree they
saw a woman,

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.986
but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.656
That is, not yet.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.740
Is that so?

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.328
Come here.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:34.169
I'd like to see
your friend's face
when we tell him.

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:36.462
He doesn't sound like
much of a detective.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:40.008
Oh, don't be too
hard on him. He's
a steady worker.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.595
I sure wish
he'd show up.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.265
Don't rush him.
We have all night.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.894
We have all what?
Night.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.604
I'm going to
stay with you.

01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:58.819
Well, you'll have
to clear that
with my landlord.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:01.947
I have the whole
weekend off.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.826
That's very nice,
but I just have
one bed.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:10.163
If you say anything
else, I'll stay
tomorrow night, too.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.126
I won't be able to
give you any pajamas.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.676
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.097
I'll bet yours
isn't this small.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:28.807
This is a suitcase?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.810
Well, a Mark Cross
overnight case, anyway.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.397
Compact, but
ample enough.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.733
Looks like you
packed in a hurry.

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:40.319
Look at this.
Isn't that amazing?

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.779
I'll trade you...

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.949
My feminine intuition
for a bed for the night.

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:48.118
I'll go along
with that.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.051
There's that
song again.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:14.353
Where does a man get
inspiration to write
a song like that?

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:17.522
Well, he gets it
from the landlady
once a month.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.569
It's utterly beautiful.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.072
I wish I could
be creative.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:26.865
Oh, sweetie,
you are.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.286
You have a great
talent for creating
difficult situations.

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:32.663
I do?
Sure.

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:35.123
Like staying here
all night uninvited.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:38.543
Surprise is
the most important
element of attack.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.755
And besides,
you're not up on your
private eye literature.

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.966
When they're in
trouble, it's always
their Girl Friday

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.384
who gets them
out of it.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.636
Is she the girl
that saves them
from the clutches

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.179
of the seductive showgirls

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:51.473
and the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.642
The same.
That's the one, huh?

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:57.479
It's funny.
He never ends up
marrying her, does he?

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:58.730
That's strange.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:11:59.940
Weird.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.278
Why don't I slip
into something
more comfortable?

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:07.072
By all means.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.992
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.577
Oh, and some
brandy, too, huh?

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.672
Harry.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.474
Jeff.
Hi.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:28.737
What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:32.240
Well, enough to scare me
you wouldn't show up in
time and we'd lose him.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.283
Think he's getting
out of here?

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.826
Look, he's got
everything he owns

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.497
laid out over there
in the bedroom,
waiting to be packed.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:44.002
I'm just warming
some brandy.
Mr. Doyle, I presume?

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.757
Tom, this is
Miss Lisa Fremont.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:49.841
How do you do?

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.886
We think Thorwald's guilty.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.520
Careful, Tom.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.026
Hello.
Lieutenant Doyle.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.487
Yeah, he's right here.
For you.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.406
Hello.
Lieutenant Doyle, sir?

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:14.783
Speaking.

01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:17.160
Yeah.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.539
All right.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:23.125
I see.
Thank you.
Goodbye.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.794
Coffee will be
ready soon.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.630
Jeff, aren't you
going to tell him
about the jewelry?

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:29.756
Jewelry?

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:33.218
He's got his wife's jewelry
hidden in his clothes in
the bedroom over there.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.427
You sure it
belonged to
his wife?

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.555
It was in
her favorite
handbag.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.307
Mr. Doyle, that
can only lead to
one conclusion.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:40.433
Namely?

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:44.479
That it was not
Mrs. Thorwald that left
with him yesterday morning.

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:45.981
You figured
that out, eh?

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.525
Well, it's simply
that women don't leave
their jewelry behind

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.610
when they go
on a trip.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:51.903
Come on,
come on,
Tom.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:55.615
Now you don't really
need any of this
information, do you?

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.748
As a matter
of fact, I don't.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.924
Lars Thorwald
is no more a
murderer than I am.

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:19.514
You mean to say you can
explain everything that's
gone on over there,

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:20.891
and is still
going on?

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.851
No, neither
can you.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.937
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.982
People do a lot of things
in private they couldn't
possibly explain in public.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.942
Like disposing
of their wives?

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.778
You get that idea out of
your mind. It'll only lead
in the wrong direction.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:36.323
What about
the knife and
the saw?

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:37.991
Did you ever
own a saw?

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.744
Well, at home in
the garage I had...

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:43.121
How many people
did you cut up with it?

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:47.626
Or with the couple of
hundred knives you've probably
owned in your lifetime?

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.045
Well, your logic
is backward.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:54.007
You can't ignore the wife
disappearing and the
trunk and the jewelry.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.843
I checked the
railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

01:15:56.928 --> 01:15:58.887
Ten minutes later,
he put his wife
on a train.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:02.098
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:05.227
That might have been a
woman, but it couldn't
have been Mrs. Thorwald.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:06.853
That jewelry...
Look, Miss Fremont.

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:09.731
That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:12.776
But in real life,
it's still a fairy tale.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.569
I don't know
how many wasted
years I've spent

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:17.239
tracking down
leads based on
female intuition.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.950
All right. I take
it you didn't
find the trunk,

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:23.536
and all this is from an
old speech you once made
at the Policemen's Ball.

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.122
I found the trunk
a half-hour after
I left here.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:29.876
I suppose it's normal
for a man to tie up a
trunk with heavy rope?

01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:31.962
Well, if the lock
is broken, yes.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:35.173
And what did you find
inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:37.342
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.845
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.764
Didn't you take them
off to the crime lab?

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.725
I sent them on their
merry and legal way.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.603
Why, when a woman
is taking a simple,
short trip,

01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:50.605
does she take
everything
she owns?

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.401
Let's let the female
psychology department
handle that one.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.821
I would say it
looked as if she
wasn't coming back.

01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.614
That's what's known
as a family problem.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.534
And if she wasn't
coming back, why didn't
he tell his landlord?

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:07.414
I'll tell you why he didn't
tell his landlord. Because
he was hiding something.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.002
Do you tell your
landlord everything?

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:13.795
I told you to
be careful, Tom.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:17.048
Look, if I'd have been careful
piloting that reconnaissance
plane during the war,

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.633
you wouldn't
have had the chance
to take the pictures

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:23.138
that won you a medal,
and a good job,
and fame and money.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:30.020
What do you say we all
sit down and have a nice,
friendly drink, too? Hmm?

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.731
Forget all about this.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.985
We can tell lies
about the good old
days during the war.

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.030
You mean
you're through
with the case?

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.949
There is no case
to be through with,
Miss Fremont.

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:44.909
How about that drink?

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.627
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.257
Well, I think
I better get home
and get some sleep.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.260
Cheers.

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:08.808
Not much of a snifter.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.191
Oh, Jeff, if you
need any more help...

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.778
Consult the Yellow Pages
in your telephone directory.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.114
Oh, I love funny
exiting lines.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.867
Who was that trunk
addressed to?

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:27.410
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:30.038
Well, then let's
wait and find out
who picks it up.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.540
Oh, that telephone call.
I gave them your number.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.958
I hope you don't mind.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.543
Depends on
who they were.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.212
The police at
Merritsville.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:39.464
They reported
the trunk was
just picked up

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.508
by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:44.844
Don't stay up too late.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.073
Look.
What?

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:39.649
Yeah,
he's kind of
young, isn't he?

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.270
What are you doing?

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:48.218
You know, much as I hate
to give Thomas J. Doyle
too much credit,

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.595
he might have gotten a hold
of something when he said

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.848
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:21:00.772
I wonder if it's ethical
to watch a man with binoculars
and a long-focus lens.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:05.527
Do you... Do you
suppose it's ethical,

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.780
even if you prove
that he didn't
commit a crime?

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:13.034
I'm not much on
rear-window ethics.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.702
Of course, they can
do the same thing to me.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:18.289
Watch me like
a bug under a glass,
if they want to.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:21.876
Jeff, you know, if someone
came in here, they wouldn't
believe what they'd see.

01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:22.961
What?

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.254
You and me
with long faces.

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:28.841
Plunged into despair
because we find out
a man didn't kill his wife.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:32.387
We're two of the most
frightening ghouls
I've ever known.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:37.433
You'd think we could be
a little bit happy that the
poor woman is alive and well.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:43.314
Whatever happened
to that old saying,
"Love thy neighbor"?

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:48.361
You know, I think
I'll start reviving
that tomorrow.

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.990
Yeah, I'll begin
with Miss Torso.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:56.703
Not if I have to move
into an apartment
across the way

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:01.499
and do the Dance
of the Seven Veils
every hour.

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.462
Show's over
for tonight.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.928
Preview of coming
attractions.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:19.058
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:23.396
No, Lisa, I don't
think he did.

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:40.330
What do you think?

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:41.414
Well...

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.751
I will rephrase
the question.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.085
Thank you.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.755
Do you like it?

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:50.923
Yes, I like it.

01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:53.968
Well...

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.312
What's the matter?

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:09.108
Somebody's hurt?
It's the dog.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.694
Something's
happened
to the dog.

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:17.659
What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.620
See, it's a dog
down there.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.955
It's dead.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.376
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:29.003
Which one of
you did it?

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:31.506
Which one of you
killed my dog?

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.010
You don't know the meaning
of the word "Neighbors."

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:40.056
Neighbors like
each other, speak
to each other,

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.475
care if anybody
lives or dies.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:44.977
But none of you do!

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:51.359
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:54.821
that you'd kill a little
helpless, friendly dog.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:00.868
The only thing in this
whole neighborhood
who liked anybody.

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:11.921
Did you kill him
because he liked you?

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.173
Just because
he liked you?

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:18.636
Let's go inside.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.727
Come on.
Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:42.076
You know, for a minute,
that Tom Doyle almost
had me convinced I was wrong.

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:44.078
But you're not?
Look.

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:48.374
In the whole courtyard,
only one person didn't
come to the window.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:49.667
Look.

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:58.426
Why would
Thorwald want to
kill a little dog?

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:02.305
Because it
knew too much?

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.399
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.443
Is he
cleaning house?

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:18.112
He's washing down
the bathroom walls.

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:19.238
Hmm.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.449
Must have
splattered
a lot.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.703
Well, why not?
That's what we're
all thinking.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:28.623
He killed her in there,
he has to clean up those
stains before he leaves.

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:31.375
Oh, Stella, your
choice of words.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.879
Nobody ever
invented a polite
word for a killing yet.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:42.970
Lisa? Lisa, back there,
on that shelf, there's a
little yellow box. You see it?

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:44.806
Top one?
Right on top, yeah.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.391
Bring it. And bring
me the viewer there.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:50.853
I just got a...

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.315
Now, these are
about two weeks old.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:58.069
I hope I took something
else besides leg art.
Now which one...

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.530
What are you
looking for?
Here.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.200
There's something, and
if I'm right, I think
I've solved a murder.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:06.077
Mrs. Thorwald?
No.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:09.288
No, the dog.

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:11.624
Uh-huh.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:14.710
I think I know
why Thorwald
killed that dog.

01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:18.381
Here, now you take
a look. Tell me
what you see.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.341
Now take it down.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:24.470
Now look again.
Now take it down.
You see?

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.140
But it's just a picture
of the backyard, that's all.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:32.228
One important change.
One important change.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:36.274
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet
flower bed.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:39.277
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.822
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.993
Look, right?
Those two yellow
zinnias on this end

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:48.911
aren't as tall
as they were.

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:52.331
Now, since when do
flowers grow shorter
in two weeks?

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:53.875
There's something
buried there.

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:55.668
Mrs. Thorwald.

01:26:56.295 --> 01:26:59.547
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:02.675
Mr. Thorwald could
scarcely put
his wife's body

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:05.720
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:08.639
Unless, of course,
he put her in
standing on end,

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:11.434
and then he wouldn't
need a knife and saw.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:15.187
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:17.565
Leg in the East River...
Oh, Stella, please!

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.066
No, no, no. There's
something in there.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:21.736
Those flowers have
been taken out
and put back in.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.696
Maybe it's the
knife and saw.
Yeah.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.822
Call Lieutenant Doyle.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:26.073
No, let's wait.

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:29.911
Let's wait till it gets
a little darker, and I'll
go over there and dig them up.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:33.998
You'll go? You won't
dig anything up and
get your neck broken.

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:36.292
No, no, we've...

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:40.129
We're not gonna call
Doyle until I can produce
Mrs. Thorwald's body.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:43.049
What we've got to do
is find a way to get
into that apartment.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:44.592
He's packing.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:46.969
Uh-oh.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:49.347
Here, get me
a pencil.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.559
Stella, get me some
note paper. It's up
here someplace.

01:27:53.644 --> 01:27:55.186
There it is.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.682
You did it,
Thorwald.
You did it.

01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:19.812
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:21.981
You never should
have let her do it.
If he ever...

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:23.357
Look. Look. Look.

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:45.713
Well, thank heaven
that's over.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:49.925
All right if I
have a drink?

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.594
Sure, go ahead.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:04.065
There's no doubt about
it. He's leaving. It's
just a question of when.

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.817
Mind if I use that
portable keyhole?

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:11.989
Go ahead, just as long
as you tell me what
you're looking at.

01:30:17.996 --> 01:30:18.996
I wonder...

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:20.206
Wonder what?

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.166
Miss Lonelyheart's
just laid out something

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.877
that looks like rhodium
tri-eckonal capsules.

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:26.253
You can tell
from here?

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:29.298
I've handled enough of
those red pills to put
everybody in Hackensack

01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:30.674
to sleep for the winter.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.426
Well, does she have
enough of them to...

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:34.512
No. It will make
the rest easy to...

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.014
Wasn't that close?

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:40.768
What was his reaction.
I mean, when he looked
at the note?

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:44.772
Well, it wasn't the kind of
an expression that would get
him a quick loan at the bank.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.690
Jeff, the handbag!

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:14.343
Suppose
Mrs. Thorwald's
wedding ring

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:17.429
is among the jewelry
he has in that handbag?

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:20.099
Now, during the phone
conversation he
held up three rings.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:23.519
One with a diamond,
one with a big
stone of some sort

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:25.479
and then just
a plain gold band.

01:31:25.564 --> 01:31:29.650
And the last thing
she would leave behind
would be a wedding ring.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:31.944
Stella, do you ever
leave yours at home?

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:36.490
The only way anybody could
get that ring would be to
chop off my finger.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.663
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:47.126
Why not? I've
always wanted to
meet Mrs. Thorwald.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.836
What are you
two talking about?
You got a shovel?

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.171
A shovel? Of course I
don't have a shovel.

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:52.047
There's probably
one in the basement.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:54.175
Jeff, if you're
squeamish, just
don't look.

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.551
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:59.180
I just don't want you two
to end up like that dog
ended up. That's all.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:02.516
Oh, you know,
Miss Fremont, he might
just have something there.

01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:04.685
Just hold on.
Here, take this.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:07.104
No sense taking any
chances in this thing.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:09.440
Here, give me
the phone book.

01:32:10.609 --> 01:32:11.859
What for?

01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:14.570
Maybe I can get him
out of that apartment.

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:16.155
We only need
a few minutes.

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:17.948
I'll see if I can
get about 15 minutes.

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:19.074
How?

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:20.159
Thorwald.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:24.622
Thorwald...
Thorwald...

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:29.418
Chelsea 27099.

01:32:30.337 --> 01:32:31.879
27099.

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:35.132
We scared him once,
maybe we can
scare him again.

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:38.886
Well, I guess I'm
using that word
"we" a little freely.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:40.930
I mean,
you're taking
all the chances.

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:42.932
Shall we vote
him in, Stella?

01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:44.058
Unanimously.

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:46.435
27099. Look out.

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:54.401
Chelsea.

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:14.588
Go on, pick it
up, Thorwald.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.466
Go on,
you're curious.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:21.595
You wonder if it's
your girlfriend calling,
the one you killed for.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.347
Go on,
pick it up.

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:28.811
Hello?

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:31.647
Did you get my note?

01:33:33.692 --> 01:33:35.901
Well, did you
get it, Thorwald?

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:37.152
Who are you?

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.446
I'll give you
a chance to
find out.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:42.283
Meet me in the bar
at the Albert Hotel.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:44.118
Do it right away.

01:33:44.202 --> 01:33:45.786
Why should I?

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:47.413
A little business
meeting...

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:50.874
To settle the estate
of your late wife.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:54.920
I don't know
what you mean.

01:33:55.005 --> 01:33:59.425
Come on. Quit stalling,
Thorwald, or I'll hang
up and call the police.

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:01.677
I have only
$100 or so.

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:03.053
That's a start.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:07.224
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:28.329
Come on, Stella,
let's go.

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:29.997
One of you
keep an eye
on this window.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:33.667
If I see him coming
back, I'll signal
with a flashbulb.

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:09.847
This is
the Doyle residence.

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:14.143
Hello, this is
L. B. Jefferies speaking.
I'm a friend of Mr. Doyle.

01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:15.436
Who's this?

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.645
This is a
babysitter.

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:18.188
Oh. Uh...

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:19.523
When do you
expect them in?

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:24.153
Well, I'm hired till
1:00. They went to dinner
and maybe a nightclub.

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:25.863
I see.

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:29.992
If he calls in, would you
have him get in touch with
L.B. Jefferies right away?

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:31.994
I might have quite
a surprise for him.

01:36:32.078 --> 01:36:34.997
Well, do we have
your number,
Mr. Jefferies?

01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:37.207
He has it.
Good night.

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:38.750
Good night.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:59.521
Stella was wrong
about Miss Lonelyheart.

01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.805
Lisa, what are you...
Don't do...

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:52.616
Lisa, what are you
doing? Don't go...

01:38:26.442 --> 01:38:29.069
Come on, come on!
Get out of there!

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:39.204
She said ring Thorwald's
phone the second you
see him come back.

01:38:39.289 --> 01:38:40.247
I'm gonna ring
it right now!

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:43.083
Oh, no. Give her
another minute.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:48.922
All right, fellows,
let's try it once
from the beginning.

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:50.757
Miss Lonelyheart.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.718
Oh, call the police!

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:56.096
Operator.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.265
Get me the police,
sixth precinct.

01:38:58.349 --> 01:38:59.683
Yes, sir.

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:14.573
Mr. Jefferies,
the music stopped her.

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:23.790
What... Lisa!

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.377
Lisa!

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.349
Precinct 6,
Sergeant Allgood.

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:45.604
Hello. Hello. Look, a man
is assaulting a woman at
125 West 9th Street.

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:49.232
Second floor,
at the rear.
Make it fast!

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.317
Your name?

01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:52.027
L.B. Jefferies.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:53.111
Phone number?

01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:55.489
Chelsea 25598.

01:40:16.094 --> 01:40:17.761
The door was open.

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:41.827
I told you...
Oh, no!

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:45.706
Let go of me! Jeff!

01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:46.998
Oh, no!

01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:48.625
Jeff! Jeff!

01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:50.210
Jeff!

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:52.963
Lisa!

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:56.550
Stella, what
do we do?

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:57.843
Jeff!

01:40:58.636 --> 01:41:00.887
Jeff!
Well,
here they come.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:53.148
What's she
trying to do? Why
doesn't she turn him in?

01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:54.566
She's a smart girl.

01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:56.276
"Smart girl"?
She'll get
herself arrested.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:59.029
It'll get her out
of there, won't it?

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.617
Look, the
wedding ring!

01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:11.875
Turn off the light!
He's seen us!

01:42:21.803 --> 01:42:23.470
How long do
you think he'll
stay there?

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:27.641
Well, unless he's dumber than
I think he is, he won't
wait until his lease is up.

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:29.726
Get my billfold
out of the drawer
in the table there.

01:42:29.811 --> 01:42:31.019
What do you
need money for?

01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:32.687
I'm gonna bail
Lisa out of jail.

01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:35.106
You know, you could
leave her there
till next Tuesday,

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:37.651
then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

01:42:37.735 --> 01:42:41.655
Yeah, let's
see. $127.

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:42.781
How much do
you need?

01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:46.284
Well, this is
first-offense burglary,
that's about $250.

01:42:46.369 --> 01:42:48.245
Lisa's handbag.
Yeah.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.664
How much
does she have?

01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:52.040
Fifty cents.

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:53.333
Here, take this.

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:55.335
Look, I got $20 or so
in my purse.

01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:56.837
What about the rest?
What about the rest?

01:42:56.921 --> 01:42:59.464
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

01:42:59.549 --> 01:43:00.841
Well, hurry up.

01:43:05.096 --> 01:43:07.430
Just a minute.
Hurry up!

01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:09.099
Jefferies.

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:10.851
All right.
What is it now?

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:14.104
Doyle, I've got
something really
big for you.

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:16.106
Why did I have to
return your call?

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:19.401
Look, Jeff! Don't
louse up my night
with another mad killer...

01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:24.072
Listen to me! Listen
to me! Lisa's in jail.
She got arrested.

01:43:24.448 --> 01:43:26.157
Your Lisa?
My Lisa.

01:43:26.242 --> 01:43:30.078
Boy, you should have
seen her. She got into
Thorwald's apartment.

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:33.331
But then he came back, and
the only way I could get her
out was to call the police.

01:43:33.416 --> 01:43:35.041
I told you...
I know you told me!

01:43:35.126 --> 01:43:38.211
She went in to get
evidence and she came
out with evidence.

01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:39.921
Like what?
Like what?

01:43:40.006 --> 01:43:42.924
Like Mrs. Thorwald's
wedding ring.
That's like what.

01:43:43.009 --> 01:43:46.803
If that woman was alive,
she'd be wearing
that ring. Right?

01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:50.015
A possibility.
A possibility.
It's a fact!

01:43:50.099 --> 01:43:54.102
He killed a dog last night
because the dog was scratching
around in the garden.

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:58.356
You know why? Because he had
something buried in that
garden that the dog scented.

01:43:58.441 --> 01:43:59.566
Like an old
ham bone?

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:02.736
Look, I don't know what
pet names Thorwald
had for his wife,

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.195
but I'll tell you this,

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.532
all those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

01:44:07.617 --> 01:44:09.242
he wasn't taking
out his possessions,

01:44:09.327 --> 01:44:12.746
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.497
Perhaps it was
old "ham bone."

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.207
Yeah, in sections.

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:17.626
And I'll tell you
something else.

01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:20.795
All the telephone calls
he made were long
distance, all right?

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.633
Now, if he called
his wife long distance
on the day she left,

01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:26.927
after she arrived
in Merritsville,

01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:30.263
why did she write a card to
him saying that she'd
arrived in Merritsville?

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:32.182
Why did she do that?

01:44:32.934 --> 01:44:34.184
Where'd they
take Lisa?

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:35.268
Precinct 6.

01:44:35.353 --> 01:44:36.686
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:38.188
Maybe you
won't need it.

01:44:38.272 --> 01:44:39.272
I'll run it down, Jeff.

01:44:39.357 --> 01:44:41.441
All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:43.360
This fellow knows
he's being watched.

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:45.278
He's not gonna
wait around forever.
Hurry up.

01:44:45.363 --> 01:44:47.364
If that ring checks out,
we'll give him an escort.

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:49.574
So long, Jeff.
So long.

01:44:57.708 --> 01:45:01.544
Hello. Hello. Tom,
I think Thorwald's
left. I don't see...

01:45:04.256 --> 01:45:05.632
Hello...

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:39.452
What do you
want from me?

01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:45.458
Your friend, the girl,
could have turned me in.

01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:47.085
Why didn't she?

01:47:49.213 --> 01:47:53.007
What is it you want?
A lot of money?
I don't have any money.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.304
Say something.

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:02.976
Say something!
Tell me what
you want!

01:48:06.105 --> 01:48:08.356
Can you get me
that ring back?

01:48:09.525 --> 01:48:10.984
No.

01:48:11.068 --> 01:48:12.902
Tell her
to bring it back!

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:15.113
I can't. The police
have it by now.

01:48:52.276 --> 01:48:54.110
Lisa! Doyle!

01:49:02.536 --> 01:49:03.953
Over there!

01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:12.295
Look! Look, over
in that apartment!

01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:32.649
Doyle!

01:49:36.737 --> 01:49:38.821
Creele!
Give me your.38!

01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:51.584
I'm sorry, Jeff. I got
here as fast as I could!

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:53.419
Oh, Mr. Jefferies!
Don't let anybody
touch him.

01:49:53.504 --> 01:49:55.380
Get my medical
bag from upstairs.

01:49:55.464 --> 01:49:57.590
Oh, Lisa, sweetie,
if anything had
happened to you...

01:49:57.675 --> 01:49:59.425
Oh, shut up.
I'm all right.

01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:01.469
Gee, I'm proud of you!

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.889
You got enough for
a search warrant now?

01:50:04.974 --> 01:50:06.140
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:50:06.225 --> 01:50:08.268
Lieutenant Doyle!
Yeah?

01:50:08.352 --> 01:50:09.435
Is he okay?

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.561
He's alive.

01:50:10.646 --> 01:50:14.190
Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.698
Did he say what was
buried in the flower bed?

01:50:21.782 --> 01:50:25.910
Yeah. He said the dog
got too inquisitive,
so he dug it up.

01:50:26.537 --> 01:50:29.372
It's in a hat box
over in his apartment.

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:30.999
Want to look?
No, thanks.

01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:33.293
I don't want any
part of her.

01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:42.302
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

01:50:42.386 --> 01:50:44.304
I'd love
to hear it.

01:50:44.388 --> 01:50:47.724
I can't tell you
what this music
has meant to me.

01:50:57.568 --> 01:51:03.072
Lisa, with your starry eyes

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:05.199
Now, let's try
it again, puppy.

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:07.493
Stay still. Stay.

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:13.666
Hold me and whisper
the sweet words
I'm yearning for

01:51:13.751 --> 01:51:15.209
Drown me in kisses

01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:16.753
Stanley!
Hi, baby!

01:51:17.004 --> 01:51:19.756
Caresses I'm burning for

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.633
My, look
what the Army's
done for you!

01:51:22.718 --> 01:51:24.469
Lisa, every touch
is new ecstasy

01:51:24.553 --> 01:51:28.598
The Army's made me
hungry. What've you got
in the icebox to eat?

01:51:29.266 --> 01:51:31.351
Boy, it's good
to be home.

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:34.687
Lisa, angels dance
when you cling to me

01:51:34.772 --> 01:51:36.356
I don't care if
you help me or not,

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:39.442
but if you'd told me you'd
quit your job, we wouldn't
have gotten married.

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:41.402
Oh, honey, come on...

01:51:41.487 --> 01:51:46.449
If this is dreaming

01:51:46.575 --> 01:51:52.455
I hope I'll never wake

01:51:54.291 --> 01:52:00.213
But dream forever

01:52:01.465 --> 01:52:08.096
In your arms, oh, Lisa

01:52:11.183 --> 01:52:15.144
Lisa
