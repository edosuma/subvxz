-But he was here.

02:50.538 --> 02:54.239
After you said he was back and
you were all worried,
I asked her.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.774
She said he was here
for about a day.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.776
She scraped together
all the money she could

02:57.778 --> 02:59.311
and gave it to him.

-Where'd he go?
-I don't know.

to bring the money.

Don't touch me, okay?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.409

tell her to.

look at you right now.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.845
And now,
I'm never afraid.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.315
Because I always say yes.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.785
And if you want to be
somebody else so bad,

05:53.787 --> 05:56.054
why not be me?

05:56.056 --> 05:59.658

12:05.425 --> 12:07.392
busted Brother Jerry
a couple months back.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.493
They take
all of his property,

12:08.495 --> 12:11.196
and they put it into a little
plastic bag for "storage."

12:11.198 --> 12:14.165
His ID card and his patch
goes into his property bag.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.601
And when he makes bail,
the man gives him
back everything

12:16.603 --> 12:18.903
but those two things,
and they lip-service it.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.971
Tell him it got lost.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.741
-Except that
this guy here...
-Bri.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.876
Bri, right. Bri here sees
a guy pushing dope

12:24.878 --> 12:26.444
down in Santa Monica
a couple days ago

12:26.446 --> 12:28.546
repping as
our Brother Jerry.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.848
Definitely said
he was a Satan,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.584
but I know you guys
don't travel alone.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.487
And I know you wouldn't go
five kilos.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.087
Hmm.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.188
You see him,
you keep him around

12:37.190 --> 12:39.390
and you call us,
and we'll do to him

12:39.392 --> 12:41.192
what you did to my knee.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.395
Again, I'm sorry
about that.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.363
No, it's okay.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.732
You get a reset
with all the positives...

12:47.734 --> 12:50.135
Even though I can't ball,
like, at all.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.437
I can't put any weight
on my knee,

12:52.439 --> 12:53.738
not even somebody else's.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.875
So, you know what? Next time
you and I are going downhill,

12:56.877 --> 12:58.343
you first.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.178
(CHUCKLES)

13:00.180 --> 13:03.882
Well, if I'm getting a reset,
uh, I got a favor to ask.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.317
When you jacked up your knee,
you remember we were

13:06.319 --> 13:09.521
heading out to try and find
your friend Charlie?

13:13.026 --> 13:17.428
Well, she was wondering if
maybe we could try again.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.668
Sugar Clam.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.739
(CHUCKLES)

13:27.874 --> 13:29.641
SADIE: <i> Right on the corner</i>
<i> of Oak and Lyon.</i>

13:29.643 --> 13:31.409
<i> The heart of Ashbury.</i>

13:31.411 --> 13:33.344
God, that was such
a good house.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.513
Tell her who lived
right down the street.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.515
Janis.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.083
-Joplin?
-Yeah.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.152
We could
hear her practicing.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.821
Look, Cherry.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.092
Almost as beautiful
as you.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.936
You should leave.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.606
Make an excuse,
your monthlies, I don't know.

14:03.977 --> 14:04.809
(SIGHS)

14:04.811 --> 14:08.046
Some rough terrain here,
I think I need
a baby-doll crutch.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.056
Hey, sugar pie...

14:19.993 --> 14:22.760
All right,
Charlie's waiting.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.835
(CHUCKLES)
Hey.

14:33.807 --> 14:36.908
-Mmm.
-(LAUGHING)

14:39.112 --> 14:40.645
(GIGGLES)

14:49.789 --> 14:51.623
Charlie, um...

14:52.225 --> 14:54.225
I thought I saw
my dad leave.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.661
This morning, in his car?

15:04.271 --> 15:06.004
Did he talk to you?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.406
Did he say
he wanted to talk to me?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.375
What did he say?

15:11.278 --> 15:15.880
Well, I wouldn't tell you this
if I didn't know

15:15.882 --> 15:17.415
you could hear it
for what it is,

15:17.417 --> 15:21.085
but he asked me
how much I wanted.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.720
For you.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.156
Like you were a used car
or a

15:25.158 --> 15:27.425
horse or a cow.

15:28.128 --> 15:33.431
If no one owns something,
it can't ever be for sale.

15:45.879 --> 15:49.247
(CHUCKLES)
Look who's walking again.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.650
Sugar Clam here says
she knows you, Charlie.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.521
Been pulling everyone's coat
looking for you.

15:56.690 --> 15:57.989
Huh.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.526
You want to find me
so bad, girl,

16:01.528 --> 16:03.561
you found me.

16:03.897 --> 16:07.231
And I can't say
I don't want to,

16:07.367 --> 16:09.567
and maybe I will, but

16:09.803 --> 16:11.769
I don't know you at all.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.507
I don't blame you

16:17.043 --> 16:18.810
for not remembering me.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.547
I wouldn't remember me
either.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.416
But you have to remember
that place.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.553
In the canyon at the edge
of the creek,

16:28.555 --> 16:31.055
where the road sloped up.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.792
It wasn't winter,
but it was cold.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.828
There was a little fire
in the fireplace,

16:36.830 --> 16:40.298
and we all huddled around
in a circle

16:40.300 --> 16:42.867
and closed our eyes,
and then...

16:45.238 --> 16:47.472
(HOWLING)

16:50.677 --> 16:53.578
(HOWLING)

17:03.890 --> 17:07.458
(HOWLING)

17:07.694 --> 17:10.194
(ALL HOWLING)

17:19.372 --> 17:21.239
(LAUGHING)

17:21.408 --> 17:23.741
Well, all right.
That's great.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.410
You kids want some candy?

17:26.980 --> 17:28.813
Don't know.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.148
Depends, I guess.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.949
MANSON: Depends on what?

17:31.951 --> 17:34.819
Chunky chocolate, taffy bits,
marshmallows?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.555
You... You don't know
if you like that stuff?

17:37.557 --> 17:40.024
-I know I do.
-Course you do.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.193
'Cause you never
got enough.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.796
Mommy and Daddy used it
like a weapon.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.899
Took it away
when you were bad.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.401
(CHUCKLES)

17:51.171 --> 17:53.638
But we're all
good children here.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.040
We get all the candy
we want.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.148
I want some now.
What... What about you?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.451
Yeah, we want some, too.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.487
Good.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.155
Moving on.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.025
Hey.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.927
ROY: She'll be right there.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.963
Thought you said you couldn't
put any weight on that knee.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.364
I can't.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.834
I'll take a little
head, though.

18:23.837 --> 18:26.471
Or maybe a lot. (CHUCKLES)

18:31.878 --> 18:33.678
I know Charlie,
so I know how Charlie goes.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.047
He goes through Roy,
remember?

18:36.216 --> 18:39.117
Go have some candy.
Please.

18:44.624 --> 18:48.059
All right, look, not only
was I here once
already today, Sam,

18:48.061 --> 18:49.193
I don't know where you get off
summoning me

18:49.195 --> 18:50.761
-like somebody's housemaid.
-You're Gladner.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.762
-You're pushing it.
-I'm the killer.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.065
I come up on you
when your back is turned,

18:54.067 --> 18:55.066
and I... Whap, whap!

18:55.068 --> 18:56.801
Both the first and the second
neck wound were fatal.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.036
So after those, he probably
went to his knees
at some point.

18:59.038 --> 19:02.006
-Oh. Okay.
-Took the next five there.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.709
One, two, three, four, five.
And then he's down.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.745
And for the last two,
he was flat on the ground.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.548
-(CHUCKLES)
-Oh, it's funny to you, too?

19:10.550 --> 19:13.117
Watching a man
lose his mind?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.153
Time of death?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.087
Last night.

19:16.089 --> 19:16.888
Mr. Gladner had been dead

19:16.890 --> 19:18.890
about eight, 10 hours
before he was found.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.092
That's eight to 10 hours
before Vickery was seen

19:21.094 --> 19:22.827
-running out of there.
-And he came back.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.629
High as a kite,
dumb as a carp.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.430
Ah, but the downward angles
of the wound

19:26.432 --> 19:28.065
show that the killer
was taller than Gladner.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.134
Vickery is not.
The killer's also a righty.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.669
I've been to
Vickery's apartment,

19:31.671 --> 19:32.603
I saw his crappy guitar.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.206
Pick guard and the bass
"E" string on the wrong side.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.507
He's a lefty.
He is not the guy.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.409
Okay, stop, stop, stop.
When you want to talk

19:38.411 --> 19:40.344
about this like cops
and not these

19:40.346 --> 19:42.580
amateur theatricals,
you let me know.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.749
And you touch me again,
I'm going to pour you out

19:44.751 --> 19:46.117
like a drink.

19:51.057 --> 19:54.959
So, you and Cut
not partners anymore, huh?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.295
Good catch.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.968
(LAUGHTER)

20:55.521 --> 20:58.823
MANSON: Thought maybe
you got lost.

21:01.361 --> 21:05.129
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
This pad is crazy.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.232
-It yours?
-Nah.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.935
Older lady I met in Frisco.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.640
Devil worship's her trip
at the moment.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.340
(CHUCKLES)

21:16.342 --> 21:18.009
She gave me a standing invite
to this place.

21:18.011 --> 21:21.612
And so when
we came down south,
we just parked the bus here

21:21.614 --> 21:26.350
and joined the preachers,
and the socialites,

21:26.452 --> 21:28.486
and the blood-drinkers.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.855
I saw it, man.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.924
Saw a guy chug some blood.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.161
House is full of people
just like that.

21:37.163 --> 21:41.766
Come here to do what they
don't want to be seen doing.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.469
That the kind of gig
you're into?

21:46.472 --> 21:47.138
I don't know.

21:47.140 --> 21:51.409
This place is full
of a lot of fear and shame.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.344
I don't want that.

21:53.913 --> 21:54.979
I want to stay
feeling good,

21:54.981 --> 22:00.451
and I don't think
good feelings
stick around here.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.255
But I guess we'll see, huh?

22:11.464 --> 22:12.930
Why, hello.

22:17.603 --> 22:18.569
Oh.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.272
Don't you both look good
and worn out.

22:21.274 --> 22:24.408
(CHUCKLES)
How'd she do?

22:26.179 --> 22:29.046
She could learn a thing
or two from Sadie, for sure.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.417
But she'll get there.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.123
Vickery's
a known associate.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.926
His alibi for established
time of death is

22:41.928 --> 22:44.028
he was home alone.
Wow.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.063
He's got a previous
knife assault on his jacket.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.065
He's got a face I want to hit
with a phone book.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.935
And you're making this
about some pissant
rear door key

22:50.937 --> 22:52.670
-and a guitar string, what?
-You arrest Vickery,

22:52.672 --> 22:54.805
you'll just end up
voiding it later.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.673
-It's not him.
-Says you.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.542
Then the real guy's lawyer
will use that voided arrest

22:58.544 --> 23:00.111
-to get the case thrown out.
-Well, if that happens,

23:00.113 --> 23:02.046
you get to say,
"I told you so."
Oh, you'll hate that.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.682
Or you can delegate me to
go find the real guy for you

23:04.684 --> 23:06.150
and then you can take
the credit.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.018
You'll hate that.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.020
Fine. Take a day.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.789
No, take two.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.557
You used to be
more fun, too.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.694
Yeah, a lot of things
used to be more fun.

23:29.709 --> 23:32.276
How'd you know to tell him
about that house?

23:32.745 --> 23:33.778
I didn't.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.346
It just sounds like
a million other places

23:35.348 --> 23:37.648
they've been to
and forgotten.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.318
-Was it real?
-It was.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.255
I went there with my mother,
years ago.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.891
She had a thing for the guy
who owned it.

23:46.893 --> 23:50.461
One night, she called him over
and over, and no answer, so...

23:50.463 --> 23:53.697
She woke me up
and we drove all the way
out there in the dark.

23:53.699 --> 23:54.965
And what happened?

23:54.967 --> 23:57.067
He told her
she should go home.

23:57.069 --> 24:00.938
And what about the, uh...
(HOWLS)

24:03.075 --> 24:05.309
I don't know where
that came from.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.516
I chose.

24:12.919 --> 24:13.684
Charmain...

24:13.686 --> 24:16.153
I'm serious about
being a cop.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.923
About being a great cop.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.425
As serious as you are.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.761
Okay?

24:26.232 --> 24:28.466
-Okay.
-(ENGINE STARTS)

24:28.835 --> 24:31.135
Sam?

24:31.938 --> 24:33.671
(GROANS)

24:33.673 --> 24:35.673
So, I didn't know

24:35.675 --> 24:39.009
if I should read it
or burn it.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.047
Anyway...

24:43.783 --> 24:45.683
I didn't open it.

24:45.685 --> 24:46.817
You're gonna do
what you're gonna do,

24:46.819 --> 24:49.553
but he is not going
back to that place.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.188
Ever.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.723
That, we agree on.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.592
He's going to prison

24:54.694 --> 24:56.360
because of you.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.110
(DOOR OPENING)

25:14.547 --> 25:15.980
All right, look.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.147
I talked to my guy
at Pendleton

25:17.149 --> 25:19.183
who said MPs
don't bother looking nowadays.

the guitar.

he looked at me and said

26:15.808 --> 26:20.277

I could just pick it up
and play it.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.345
(THUDDING)

39:42.414 --> 39:44.080
(GLASS SHATTERS)

39:44.082 --> 39:46.483
(DOOR OPENS)

39:55.360 --> 39:57.694
Charlie.
Did you just break...

39:57.963 --> 39:59.629
What are you doing here?

40:02.401 --> 40:04.000
What is this?
Why are you here?

40:04.002 --> 40:05.635
I brought you
a present.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.806
Two presents.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.376
I don't understand.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.978
Oh, I'll, uh...

40:14.980 --> 40:16.646
I'll stay long enough
to make sure

40:16.648 --> 40:19.249
there's no static, but, uh...

40:19.518 --> 40:21.451
But they're yours, man...

40:22.053 --> 40:24.053
For as long
as you want 'em.

40:30.362 --> 40:31.294
(CHUCKLES)

40:31.296 --> 40:34.164
You shared your good
with me, man.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.733
Now I'm sharing mine.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.817
Just tell me.
Tell me anything.

40:53.819 --> 40:54.984
Just stop.
Will you stop?

40:54.986 --> 40:56.119
Where you were,
where you go,

40:56.121 --> 40:57.987
what you think,
who you are.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.156

41:05.230 --> 41:08.331
MANSON: <i> I knew you'd want</i>
<i> to hear this, Kenny.</i>

41:08.667 --> 41:11.067
<i> I knew you'd be waiting to.</i>

41:11.937 --> 41:16.139
Something so beautiful
from something so ugly.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.775
<i> And all because of you.</i>

41:22.247 --> 41:25.048
GIRLS:
<i> # Always is always forever</i>

41:25.050 --> 41:27.283

41:27.285 --> 41:30.453
<i> # Inside yourself</i>
<i> for your father</i>

41:30.455 --> 41:33.256
<i> # All is none, all is none,</i>

41:33.391 --> 41:36.459
<i> # It's time to drop</i>
<i> all from behind you</i>

41:36.528 --> 41:38.328
Listen to your Emma.

41:38.763 --> 41:41.464
<i> Like an angel's dream</i>
<i> of an angel.</i>

41:41.800 --> 41:45.034
<i> Through her, I finally see</i>
<i> how to do it.</i>

41:46.304 --> 41:48.705
How to make the worm turn.

41:49.941 --> 41:50.874
Hello? Who is this?

41:50.876 --> 41:52.542
<i> # The valley of death</i>
<i> may not find you</i>

42:00.986 --> 42:02.318
Emma, baby.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.521
<i> # No cold and fear</i>
<i> or hunger</i>

42:04.523 --> 42:08.625
<i> # You can see, you can see,</i>
<i> you can see #</i>
