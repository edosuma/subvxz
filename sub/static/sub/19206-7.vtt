WEBVTT

00:01.541 --> 00:03.379
We are getting married...

00:03.871 --> 00:04.878
tonight.

00:05.351 --> 00:07.812
We're gonna get a chuppah
because Lily's Jewish.

00:07.846 --> 00:09.080
I saw Emmett last night.

00:09.115 --> 00:10.611
- How's he doing?
- A lot better.

00:10.650 --> 00:12.090
He's taking a photography class

00:12.092 --> 00:15.151
and he wants to take photos
of me giving him a tattoo.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:24.098 --> 00:26.223
You showed your tattoo to Travis?

00:28.190 --> 00:31.902
As long as I'm with Travis,
you and I can't be friends.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.471
Hey. Ally, right?

00:34.486 --> 00:36.356
You know I had open heart surgery.

00:36.401 --> 00:38.033
It was actually a heart transplant.

00:38.073 --> 00:40.331
Two years ago, on April 14th.

00:40.354 --> 00:42.758
The donor was a man who
died in a car accident.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.634
You have Angelo's heart.

00:46.294 --> 00:50.588
- For the 100th time, it's okay.
- I still feel awful.

00:50.637 --> 00:51.858
What's up?

00:51.900 --> 00:54.343
I lost the necklace that you gave her.

00:54.385 --> 00:55.896
- The one with the heart.
- It's from Milan.

00:55.917 --> 00:58.056
You will have to go to
Italy to get another one.

00:58.089 --> 01:00.806
Mm, that's perfect. Next
summer, huh? All of us?

01:00.851 --> 01:02.545
- What do you say? Huh? Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

01:02.912 --> 01:05.872
Look what Angelo scored
for your apartment.

01:05.992 --> 01:08.543
I raided the restaurant kitchen.

01:08.565 --> 01:10.699
- My chef was not pleased.
- Awesome!

01:10.716 --> 01:12.738
I mean, not that I know
how to use any of this,

01:12.766 --> 01:15.183
but thankfully my roomie does.

01:16.284 --> 01:20.197
Mm, mm! That is to die for.

01:20.270 --> 01:21.950
A new dish on the menu.

01:21.985 --> 01:24.325
- Bucatini All'Regina.
- Aww...

01:24.445 --> 01:26.687
All right, lovebirds. Hey!

01:26.708 --> 01:28.275
Do you think that Carlton's awake yet?

01:28.311 --> 01:29.948
- Oh, let's go see.
- Yes!

01:31.028 --> 01:32.524
The baby!

01:39.824 --> 01:41.864
Wow, you...

01:42.323 --> 01:44.519
Hey, Grandpa!

01:44.815 --> 01:48.882
Do you know Angelo's
offers senior discounts?

01:48.931 --> 01:50.824
Oh, is that right? Oh, well,

01:50.853 --> 01:51.987
you just wait, my friend,

01:52.005 --> 01:53.315
'cause you're gonna
get there soon enough.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.574
- I know.
- Hey, I'm making a list of venues

01:55.601 --> 01:57.107
for the athletic department fundraiser,

01:57.109 --> 01:59.273
and I wanted to put
Angelo's on the list.

01:59.323 --> 02:02.512
I don't know, the manager
is a pretty tough negotiator.

02:02.543 --> 02:03.718
Stop it!

02:03.731 --> 02:05.661
- Just send me the dates.
- Will do.

02:05.679 --> 02:08.186
Where is my adorable nephew?

02:08.191 --> 02:10.418
- Uh, Lily's feeding him.
- Toby, I was thinking maybe you and I

02:10.431 --> 02:12.609
could build him a swing set?

02:12.943 --> 02:14.271
Oh, that'd be amazing.

02:14.289 --> 02:15.956
There he is!

02:15.969 --> 02:17.036
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:17.072 --> 02:18.183
Carlton!

02:18.242 --> 02:19.380
Here he is.

02:26.124 --> 02:27.485
He's so beautiful.

02:27.499 --> 02:28.840
You're so good with him.

02:30.331 --> 02:32.089
I can't wait to be a grandpa.

02:34.691 --> 02:37.221
Sweetheart, are... are you okay?

02:39.759 --> 02:41.503
I just wish you were here.

02:51.504 --> 02:55.641
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:01.934 --> 03:02.983
Are you alone?

03:05.666 --> 03:06.574
Hm.

03:55.196 --> 03:59.261
Like, seriously, the best sex ever.

04:06.124 --> 04:07.877
Oh, my god!

04:07.900 --> 04:09.680
How could you even ask me that?

04:09.721 --> 04:12.941
Okay, you have got to figure this out.

04:19.081 --> 04:21.498
It's Daphne, she needs
to see me. Something's up.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.071
Hey, Mom, have you
seen Carlton's elephant?

04:34.496 --> 04:37.151
Oh, yeah. It's around here somewhere.

04:38.038 --> 04:40.162
Um... hey, honey?

04:40.324 --> 04:42.105
I have a call-in to Reverend Steve

04:42.145 --> 04:44.390
to check dates for Carlton's baptism.

04:44.425 --> 04:45.244
Oh, yeah?

04:45.321 --> 04:47.702
Yeah, I was thinking sometime
in the next couple of weeks

04:47.724 --> 04:49.314
if that's okay with you and Lily.

04:51.565 --> 04:52.559
Ah!

04:53.349 --> 04:54.772
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.505
Uh, yeah, sounds good to me.
Let me run it by the wife.

04:57.523 --> 04:58.653
Okay.

04:59.755 --> 05:01.250
What does she want?

05:01.589 --> 05:03.681
To thank us, I guess.

05:03.735 --> 05:06.491
She was born with a
congenital heart defect,

05:06.522 --> 05:08.352
and she was pretty bad off.

05:08.472 --> 05:11.493
She said a few more days
and she would have died, too.

05:12.929 --> 05:14.063
Are you a little weirded out?

05:14.398 --> 05:15.898
Yeah, of course.

05:17.944 --> 05:19.363
She seems cool though.

05:19.589 --> 05:21.463
Just try to have an open mind.

05:24.545 --> 05:26.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:28.015 --> 05:30.232
Bay, this is Ally. Ally, this is Bay.

05:30.268 --> 05:31.407
Nice to meet you.

05:31.647 --> 05:33.359
Uh, you too.

05:34.988 --> 05:36.941
God, this is strange, isn't it?

05:37.844 --> 05:39.467
It feels kind of like a blind date.

05:39.895 --> 05:41.711
Yeah. A little.

05:43.726 --> 05:45.664
Well, I just wanted
to thank you in person.

05:45.944 --> 05:47.514
I know it must have been really hard

05:47.548 --> 05:49.233
to donate your dad's organs, but

05:49.522 --> 05:51.040
you literally saved me.

05:51.361 --> 05:54.690
Uh, we wanted something good to...

05:55.463 --> 05:56.498
come of his death.

05:56.733 --> 06:00.401
We heard he helps 34
people with his organs.

06:00.521 --> 06:01.775
That's incredible!

06:02.240 --> 06:04.526
There's this massive group
of us who are still alive

06:04.544 --> 06:05.881
because of Angelo Sorrento.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.273
Science is pretty amazing.

06:10.393 --> 06:11.809
I wanted to do the same thing,

06:11.822 --> 06:13.701
but my mom's organs weren't healthy.

06:13.821 --> 06:15.820
Did you say that your mom died?

06:16.132 --> 06:17.568
Pancreatic cancer.

06:18.283 --> 06:19.977
She never stopped fighting.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.629
For either of us.

06:22.832 --> 06:24.820
Do you have any other family?

06:24.940 --> 06:26.347
It was just us.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.169
Anyways, I vowed if I
ever got a new heart,

06:30.354 --> 06:32.085
I would make the most of my life.

06:32.383 --> 06:34.136
Never take anything for granted.

06:34.195 --> 06:36.200
- You're healthy now.
- I feel amazing.

06:36.499 --> 06:38.720
I'm doing things I never
thought I'd be able to do.

06:39.071 --> 06:41.145
I literally went
skydiving a few months ago.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.046
I'm mountain biking,

06:43.091 --> 06:45.291
- salsa dancing...
- Wh... No way!

06:45.806 --> 06:48.663
- Angelo loved salsa dancing.
- Seriously?

06:48.719 --> 06:50.365
Well, it's not that coincidental.

06:50.394 --> 06:53.195
It makes sense that someone
with a new, healthy heart

06:53.229 --> 06:55.471
would have a more active lifestyle.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.138
That's true.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.507
- But...
- But?

07:02.117 --> 07:04.353
I'm having all these
weird cravings I never had

07:04.370 --> 07:07.048
before the surgery, like red wine.

07:07.168 --> 07:09.311
And I like different types
of music, like classical,

07:09.333 --> 07:12.089
which I never paid attention to before.

07:14.161 --> 07:15.697
But tell me more about you guys!

07:15.703 --> 07:17.363
Daphne's pre-med. What about you?

07:17.380 --> 07:20.357
- Well, I'm a tattoo artist.
- No way!

07:20.374 --> 07:22.847
I've been thinking about getting
one to cover my chest scar.

07:22.864 --> 07:24.253
I just haven't landed
on the right one yet.

07:24.282 --> 07:26.179
I work at Bombshell Betty's on Lynwood.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.415
Come by. We'll figure it out.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.855
That would be awesome.

07:30.578 --> 07:31.561
Well, I gotta go.

07:31.561 --> 07:34.164
But I am so glad we
got a chance to connect.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.428
Next time, I'd love to meet Regina.

07:37.241 --> 07:38.546
Definitely.

07:38.585 --> 07:41.219
Uh, we should talk to her first.

07:41.699 --> 07:42.970
Totally get it.

07:43.235 --> 07:44.884
I will wait for the green light.

07:45.918 --> 07:47.561
See you both soon, I hope?

07:47.957 --> 07:49.126
Bye.

07:52.497 --> 07:54.919
You were right. She's awesome.

07:58.053 --> 07:59.318
Baptized?

07:59.330 --> 08:00.905
What do you mean? Like
dunking him in water?

08:01.154 --> 08:02.854
No, there's no dunking.

08:02.888 --> 08:05.192
It's just a few drops. It's symbolic.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.044
Of turning him into a Christian?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.148
Yeah, I guess.

08:09.183 --> 08:11.132
I thought we agreed not
to raise him as anything.

08:11.133 --> 08:13.261
We'll just do the fun
stuff, like holidays.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.566
My mom brought it up.

08:14.617 --> 08:17.062
I think it would mean a lot to her.

08:17.316 --> 08:19.468
- I'm Jewish, Toby.
- I know.

08:19.502 --> 08:21.698
But we had a blended wedding ceremony,

08:21.732 --> 08:24.926
and that worked. So, Carlton
can be both religions,

08:24.940 --> 08:27.890
- Jewish and Christian.
- You can't be both when you're baptized.

08:27.899 --> 08:28.893
Look,

08:29.195 --> 08:30.650
we'll put him in a little white suit,

08:30.691 --> 08:32.063
we'll take some pictures,

08:32.100 --> 08:33.953
then we all go out and have
a great meal. That's it.

08:34.124 --> 08:36.044
Look, I can decorate a Christmas tree,

08:36.102 --> 08:39.197
I can dye some Easter eggs, but

08:39.256 --> 08:41.578
baptism is a bridge too far.

08:43.570 --> 08:46.041
Well, what's that ceremony
where they chop off

08:46.073 --> 08:47.608
the foreskin of the kid's Johnson?

08:47.943 --> 08:48.928
A bris.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.505
Yeah, that one. Um,

08:50.568 --> 08:51.806
we didn't do that one.

08:52.217 --> 08:54.101
And I just figured if

08:54.168 --> 08:56.454
- religion was that important to you...
- No, of course my parents

08:56.472 --> 08:57.963
bugged me about having a bris.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.516
I just didn't want to
impose my religion on you.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.982
Like I'm doing to you right now.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.525
Hey, Mom?

09:09.742 --> 09:12.083
- Yeah?
- So, I'm doing this project for school

09:12.096 --> 09:15.340
on something called cellular memory...

09:15.368 --> 09:19.112
- Yeah?
- It's the theory that every cell

09:19.121 --> 09:21.895
contains a full set of genetic material.

09:22.015 --> 09:23.652
So that means that

09:23.772 --> 09:28.814
organ transplant patients
would inherit their donor's DNA.

09:28.849 --> 09:30.966
Sounds like an interesting assignment.

09:34.932 --> 09:36.743
Have you ever wondered

09:36.820 --> 09:40.371
about any of the people
who got Angelo's organs?

09:40.452 --> 09:41.428
What?

09:41.767 --> 09:42.756
No.

09:43.054 --> 09:46.637
So, you've never thought
about meeting any of them?

09:46.709 --> 09:47.839
Absolutely not.

09:48.792 --> 09:49.867
How come?

09:50.676 --> 09:54.516
Because I... don't like
to think about that day.

09:54.534 --> 09:56.174
That decision.

09:56.579 --> 09:58.058
That whole time.

09:59.264 --> 10:00.819
Last person I want to
dredge all that up with

10:00.832 --> 10:02.038
is a complete stranger.

10:02.111 --> 10:03.502
But those people have

10:03.990 --> 10:06.226
a piece of him inside of them.

10:06.461 --> 10:08.010
I'm not interested.

10:23.606 --> 10:24.667
Boo.

10:25.115 --> 10:26.452
Hey, you!

10:26.502 --> 10:29.700
- Rad place.
- Yeah, I lucked out.

10:30.061 --> 10:31.041
Are those for me?

10:31.050 --> 10:33.322
Uh, yeah.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.689
I wasn't sure what you
were looking for, but, um...

10:36.809 --> 10:38.329
Super cool.

10:39.020 --> 10:43.520
I... I also didn't know
how long the scar was, so...

10:43.895 --> 10:45.453
It's pretty gnarly.

10:45.801 --> 10:47.486
Like, from here to here.

10:48.182 --> 10:50.445
- You wanna see?
- Sure.

10:56.015 --> 10:57.235
You wanna feel it?

10:57.736 --> 10:58.956
Yeah.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.033
That's your dad's heart.

11:14.145 --> 11:15.541
That is so crazy.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.497
Yeah.

11:19.205 --> 11:20.425
Either of these are great.

11:20.443 --> 11:21.875
Cool! Um...

11:21.951 --> 11:24.228
the thing is, is I've heard that, uh,

11:24.246 --> 11:26.040
scar tissue is tricky.

11:26.049 --> 11:28.466
It's less porous, so it
holds the ink differently.

11:28.475 --> 11:30.499
It may require repeat sessions.

11:30.619 --> 11:34.149
I've got the time, but if it's
pricey, I may have to postpone.

11:34.442 --> 11:36.570
I'm not exactly flush
with cash right now.

11:36.610 --> 11:39.059
Oh, no, god. It's on the house.

11:40.315 --> 11:41.517
Okay.

11:41.637 --> 11:43.275
Uh, I have a couple more ideas.

11:43.284 --> 11:45.723
Why don't I just come by your
place later? Where do you live?

11:45.983 --> 11:48.795
I'm actually kind of
inbetween places at the moment.

11:48.915 --> 11:50.634
The landlord at my last apartment

11:50.669 --> 11:52.736
- wouldn't stop hitting on me.
- What?

11:52.856 --> 11:54.315
I had to threaten to call the cops

11:54.337 --> 11:55.934
just to get my security deposit back.

11:55.936 --> 11:57.915
That is awful.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.001
Where are you staying now?

12:00.638 --> 12:01.785
My car.

12:01.849 --> 12:03.434
- Ally!
- It's fine!

12:03.461 --> 12:04.550
I know all the good spots to park

12:04.564 --> 12:06.059
so I don't get busted or bothered.

12:06.104 --> 12:07.956
You could stay with me and Daphne.

12:08.076 --> 12:09.889
No. No, no, no, no, no.

12:09.916 --> 12:13.523
- That's really cool of you, but...
- I mean, we have so much extra space

12:13.540 --> 12:15.223
and plus, we have a couch that is

12:15.240 --> 12:16.793
way more comfortable than bucket seats.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.678
And it would give us a chance to get
to know each other better. Please?

12:20.260 --> 12:22.778
I would really, really like that.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.070
Okay.

12:25.854 --> 12:27.468
Thanks.

13:35.793 --> 13:38.678
- No way!
- I swear to God.

13:38.706 --> 13:39.784
And I went to prom with him,

13:39.801 --> 13:41.371
and I had that van for two years.

13:41.371 --> 13:43.981
- That is awesome!
- Best decision I ever made.

13:45.262 --> 13:46.940
- Hey!
- Oh, you're home!

13:47.109 --> 13:48.121
What's so funny?

13:48.149 --> 13:50.944
Well, she was just telling
me this hilarious story

13:50.967 --> 13:53.931
about this one time
this high school kid,

13:53.959 --> 13:56.388
he tried to sell her his VW van.

13:56.388 --> 13:58.840
But I was broke, so I offered
to go to prom with him instead.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.824
And he agreed.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.577
- Cool.
- I actually had a blast that night.

14:03.612 --> 14:06.792
Oh! And, we just came up
with the most amazing idea.

14:06.809 --> 14:09.576
Next summer, the three of us, Italy.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.933
- O... okay.
- To meet Angelo's family!

14:12.940 --> 14:15.007
I have this friend who can
hook us up with cheap flights.

14:15.007 --> 14:16.983
- Anywhere we want to go.
- Sounds great.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.382
I will text my friend.

14:18.394 --> 14:20.262
Oh, hey, there's better
reception in the bedroom.

14:20.279 --> 14:21.522
Oh.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.181
What are those?

14:25.210 --> 14:30.259
Ah, Ally's inbetween
apartments right now, uh,

14:30.298 --> 14:34.262
so I told her that
she could stay with us.

15:20.542 --> 15:22.834
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm, definitely.

15:23.709 --> 15:26.832
Actually, I talked to Regina,

15:27.126 --> 15:30.848
and she's not ready to meet you yet.

15:31.441 --> 15:32.638
Oh.

15:33.525 --> 15:34.874
Okay.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.133
It's just hard for her.

15:38.190 --> 15:39.590
It's fine.

15:39.607 --> 15:41.154
I can't really blame her.

15:42.773 --> 15:43.868
Hey, at least the three of us

15:43.887 --> 15:45.083
are getting to know each other, right?

15:45.107 --> 15:46.354
Yeah.

15:46.614 --> 15:48.627
Ooh! More snacks!

15:52.573 --> 15:54.461
Oh, thank you, honey.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.035
So, uh,

15:58.116 --> 16:00.371
since it's kind of a
foreign thing to her,

16:00.403 --> 16:02.838
I don't think Lily's totally
down with the whole...

16:03.168 --> 16:04.885
baptism thing.

16:05.485 --> 16:07.035
He has to be baptized.

16:07.582 --> 16:09.860
- Why?
- 'Cause that's what you do.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.934
- Well, it's what Christians do.
- Isn't Carlton Christian?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.289
I... don't know.

16:17.797 --> 16:18.954
I mean,

16:19.586 --> 16:22.291
typically, that's a
conversation you have

16:22.336 --> 16:25.889
before you have kids
and get married, except

16:26.009 --> 16:28.429
we obviously didn't have
that conversation, so...

16:28.610 --> 16:31.996
Here's the thing. You were baptized.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.754
Bay was baptized.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.029
I missed out with
Daphne. I really just...

16:36.221 --> 16:39.694
I wanna have that moment
with my first grandchild.

16:39.728 --> 16:41.495
Yeah, I totally get it.

16:42.332 --> 16:45.822
Look, as long as you're okay
with it, then I'll talk to her.

16:45.850 --> 16:48.363
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

16:49.504 --> 16:50.949
It's gonna be fine.

16:57.359 --> 16:59.335
You get such amazing light in here.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.515
It's one of the things
I love most about it.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.667
Hey, sweetie.

17:04.711 --> 17:06.252
What are you doing here?

17:06.569 --> 17:08.166
I... I was just getting a coffee.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.358
I told you, she doesn't
want to meet you.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.569
- What's going on?
- I wasn't gonna tell her. I swear.

17:13.825 --> 17:14.960
Tell me what?

17:15.079 --> 17:18.461
- It's... it's nothing.
- Don't lie to me.

17:18.792 --> 17:20.776
Mom, this is Ally.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.729
She has Angelo's heart.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.972
I'm sorry, I just wanted to see you.

17:37.159 --> 17:38.910
You need to go.

17:43.625 --> 17:45.475
Mom.

17:53.013 --> 17:54.834
I am so sorry.

17:56.528 --> 17:59.476
- How long have you known her?
- Just a few days.

17:59.596 --> 18:02.412
I told her you didn't want to meet her.

18:02.532 --> 18:05.317
- I don't know why she did that.
- It's not your fault.

18:05.437 --> 18:08.874
I just hope from now on
she respects our wishes.

18:09.051 --> 18:10.668
I'll talk to her.

18:10.788 --> 18:12.559
Thank you.

20:46.528 --> 20:49.069
This is all happening way too fast.

20:49.091 --> 20:52.537
I mean, for all we know, she
doesn't even have Angelo's heart.

20:52.554 --> 20:53.526
- Daphne!
- What?

20:53.554 --> 20:55.356
That's a horrible thing to say!

20:55.384 --> 20:58.226
- Plus, I've seen her scar.
- Maybe it's someone else's

20:58.231 --> 21:00.925
or some other surgery altogether,

21:00.948 --> 21:04.297
and she read about us and
saw we were from Mission Hills

21:04.342 --> 21:08.449
- and decided to play us.
- Where is all of this coming from?

21:08.494 --> 21:10.160
She is a complete stranger,

21:10.205 --> 21:14.352
- and now she is living with us.
- She has our dad's heart.

21:14.408 --> 21:17.141
- And I like having her around.
- Why?

21:17.152 --> 21:19.665
Because when I'm around her,

21:19.682 --> 21:22.235
I feel connected to Angelo.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.997
The question is, why don't you?

21:29.815 --> 21:32.463
So I heard Carlton's
big day is coming up.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.225
How do you feel about all that?

21:34.473 --> 21:36.077
What? Baptism?

21:36.197 --> 21:41.374
Everything. God, angels, Heaven, Hell.

21:41.395 --> 21:43.563
I mean, I don't necessarily
see myself playing a harp

21:43.591 --> 21:45.517
on a little white cloud, but...

21:46.223 --> 21:48.729
I do believe you get
to see your loved ones.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.630
I'm gonna see my mom.

21:51.651 --> 21:54.009
You really think she's up there?

21:54.129 --> 21:57.683
- Watching over you?
- Yeah. Actually, I do.

21:58.855 --> 22:00.908
I even talk to her sometimes.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.378
Really?

22:02.648 --> 22:05.759
Yeah, I mean, don't you ever
think about your dad or Angelo?

22:05.946 --> 22:11.435
I'd like to believe that
we go on after we die,

22:11.555 --> 22:16.303
that there's life after this one, but...

22:16.992 --> 22:18.459
I don't.

22:18.896 --> 22:21.403
I think when we're done, we're done.

22:21.849 --> 22:23.051
Okay.

22:23.537 --> 22:25.745
There's no reason to
feel guilty about that.

22:26.192 --> 22:27.914
It's not guilt.

22:28.298 --> 22:29.704
I just think...

22:30.342 --> 22:31.771
you're lucky.

22:32.223 --> 22:34.707
To get comfort from that.

22:37.763 --> 22:42.083
The Internet has made it far
too easy to identify donors.

22:42.156 --> 22:44.601
In fact, we've stopped
telling recipients

22:44.635 --> 22:46.922
their age and sex for that very reason.

22:47.042 --> 22:48.904
I'm not here to blame anyone.

22:49.226 --> 22:52.361
I just want to make sure that Ally
actually got my father's heart.

22:52.552 --> 22:54.034
I'm sorry.

22:54.154 --> 22:57.465
I can't reveal the recipient's
identity without their consent.

22:57.745 --> 23:00.239
Ally claims she has Angelo's heart.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.742
Her identity's out there.

23:01.742 --> 23:04.571
She approached my family.
Our identity's out there.

23:04.576 --> 23:07.626
Now, I'm just trying to
confirm that she was, in fact,

23:07.637 --> 23:09.918
the actual recipient.

23:12.595 --> 23:16.002
- "Sorrento" with two 'R's?
- Yes.

23:18.692 --> 23:20.103
Let's see...

23:23.309 --> 23:25.222
Alexandra Morel.

23:25.709 --> 23:27.304
Yeah, that's her.

23:27.619 --> 23:30.662
- So, she does have Angelo's heart?
- Yes.

23:32.937 --> 23:34.036
What is it?

23:34.071 --> 23:35.645
I remember her case.

23:36.070 --> 23:37.922
It presented the hospital with

23:37.936 --> 23:40.142
a very complicated situation.

23:40.262 --> 23:41.736
What do you mean?

23:43.294 --> 23:45.151
I can't share the details,

23:46.036 --> 23:48.643
but you might want to do some
digging into her background.

23:51.142 --> 23:53.455
It's such a pleasure,
meeting you and Carlton.

23:53.505 --> 23:55.365
- He's a wonderful child.
- Thank you.

23:55.485 --> 23:57.500
So, Lily wasn't raised in our faith,

23:57.511 --> 23:59.837
and so I'm helping her
navigate all of this.

23:59.854 --> 24:02.436
Could you just tell her a
little bit about the ceremony?

24:02.556 --> 24:03.881
Well, it's very simple.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.004
We'll sprinkle a bit of holy
water over Carlton's head,

24:07.066 --> 24:08.822
and speak the Rite of Baptism.

24:08.839 --> 24:12.328
Can I just ask, what does
the ceremony mean exactly?

24:12.368 --> 24:15.022
Well, infant baptism is a way of

24:15.028 --> 24:17.286
removing the stain of
sin from a child's soul.

24:17.755 --> 24:20.771
I... I don't understand. How
can a one-year-old have sinned?

24:21.110 --> 24:23.811
We believe every child
is born with original sin

24:23.834 --> 24:25.361
passed on to us through our parents.

24:25.374 --> 24:27.759
Not a single one of us is blameless,

24:27.796 --> 24:30.731
and, God forbid anything
should happen to Carlton,

24:30.766 --> 24:33.541
that way, he would die in
the light of God's mercy.

24:33.596 --> 24:37.269
So, Carlton has to be baptized
and saved from the fires of Hell

24:37.389 --> 24:39.705
because of the terrible things
that Toby and I have done?

24:40.875 --> 24:42.243
Kathryn, is that what you think?

24:43.431 --> 24:45.870
I see it as more symbolic.

24:45.947 --> 24:47.122
Right, Reverend?

24:47.916 --> 24:49.927
It is that as well, and

24:50.000 --> 24:51.811
a reminder that we are immersed

24:51.829 --> 24:54.137
in the Father's love for
us through Jesus Christ.

24:54.257 --> 24:56.129
"Father". Of course.

24:56.188 --> 24:58.687
- All men.
- Don't worry, Lily.

24:58.746 --> 25:01.276
Our church is very inclusive of women.

25:01.574 --> 25:05.441
Um, now, I have some exciting news.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.820
The bishop himself will be
at our church next Sunday.

25:09.227 --> 25:11.535
He would be more than happy
to perform the ceremony.

25:11.655 --> 25:15.053
Amazing! This is a really big
deal, Lily. What do you think?

25:15.077 --> 25:16.487
Will next Sunday work?

25:19.836 --> 25:20.815
No.

25:21.610 --> 25:22.622
It won't.

25:22.966 --> 25:24.646
You see, I'm Jewish.

25:24.907 --> 25:27.334
And I'm gonna be
raising my child Jewish.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.161
Thank you for stopping by, Reverend.

25:31.758 --> 25:34.365
It was very... illuminating.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.835
If you have anything else in mind,

25:46.853 --> 25:48.140
now is your chance.

25:48.490 --> 25:49.656
I think it's cool.

25:49.692 --> 25:50.827
All right.

25:52.978 --> 25:54.871
- Can I ask you a
question? - Mm-hmm.

25:55.142 --> 25:56.841
How'd the accident happen?

25:57.713 --> 25:58.855
Um...

25:58.975 --> 26:02.397
doctor said that he had
an aneurysm while driving.

26:02.704 --> 26:04.955
He lost control of the car, and...

26:05.524 --> 26:06.872
hit a tree.

26:07.905 --> 26:11.086
- Where was it?
- Not far from here. Just, uh,

26:11.434 --> 26:12.609
on Brixton Road.

26:12.645 --> 26:14.159
It's past the power station.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.618
I know that spot.

26:17.805 --> 26:19.395
I used to see flowers there.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.753
I can't even bring
myself to drive past it.

26:21.762 --> 26:24.833
I go miles out of the
way just to avoid it.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.213
- Hey!
- She's been lying to us.

26:28.240 --> 26:30.656
You weren't born with
a congenital defect.

26:30.679 --> 26:33.345
You ruined your heart
from cocaine abuse,

26:33.358 --> 26:36.074
and your mom didn't die from cancer.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.335
She's in prison.

26:37.814 --> 26:40.533
- What are you talking about?
- She's been arrested, too.

26:40.653 --> 26:42.841
- Twice, for DUls.
- First of all,

26:42.868 --> 26:44.968
I was barely stoned.
I had, like, two bumps.

26:44.991 --> 26:46.821
You're defending driving high?

26:46.826 --> 26:48.470
The cop asked me out after he booked me.

26:48.484 --> 26:50.584
He was just looking for
a reason to pull me over.

26:50.621 --> 26:52.943
And my mom may be in jail,
but she's still dead to me.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.944
Sounds to me like you didn't deserve

26:54.957 --> 26:57.035
- to be on the transplant list.
- Who are you to judge me?

26:57.044 --> 26:58.391
You don't know anything about me!

26:58.427 --> 27:00.315
A Mission Hills girl
telling me what I did wrong?

27:00.342 --> 27:03.211
You do not get a pass
because you had a hard life.

27:03.270 --> 27:04.747
I had a hard life, too.

27:04.867 --> 27:06.220
Hold on a second.

27:07.757 --> 27:09.740
Just tell us the truth, okay?

27:10.006 --> 27:11.601
Did you lie about...

27:12.328 --> 27:13.394
everything?

27:13.828 --> 27:16.913
The connection that
you felt with Angelo...

27:17.460 --> 27:19.091
were you making all of that up?

27:19.211 --> 27:20.623
What do you want me to say?

27:21.552 --> 27:24.131
I lost my biological dad

27:24.434 --> 27:26.299
the day that I got switched

27:26.760 --> 27:31.151
and then I lost him again
the day that he died.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.030
And thanks to you,

27:33.057 --> 27:35.967
I just lost him for a third time.

27:40.246 --> 27:41.876
I said what you wanted to hear.

27:57.128 --> 27:59.405
Hey, what happened?

28:00.326 --> 28:01.415
I shouldn't have said anything

28:01.447 --> 28:03.335
without talking it
through with you first.

28:03.863 --> 28:07.348
By the way, I had no idea my mom
was gonna ambush you like that.

28:07.357 --> 28:09.526
I knew it was coming
from a good place, but...

28:10.407 --> 28:13.470
I just sat there growing
more and more uncomfortable.

28:13.590 --> 28:16.176
But hearing that reverend
say "Christ" a million times,

28:16.203 --> 28:18.299
I have never felt
more Jewish in my life.

28:18.313 --> 28:20.111
And then I realized,

28:20.391 --> 28:23.449
I don't want my child
to be nothing, or both.

28:23.684 --> 28:25.681
I want him to have an identity.

28:25.984 --> 28:27.488
A Jewish identity.

28:28.364 --> 28:31.662
Jews are defined by being
other than, not Christian.

28:32.023 --> 28:34.377
For me, you're either Jewish,

28:34.422 --> 28:36.804
different from the rest of
the world and proud of it,

28:37.007 --> 28:37.973
or you're not.

28:39.026 --> 28:40.454
And I'm Jewish.

28:41.457 --> 28:42.545
Wow.

28:42.862 --> 28:43.956
So...

28:44.904 --> 28:47.050
does this mean I have to be Jewish?

28:47.506 --> 28:49.219
I would never put that on you.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.627
I know I'm asking a lot,
to hope that you'll agree

28:53.641 --> 28:56.220
to bring up our child
solely in my faith.

28:56.292 --> 28:57.751
Is any of this...

28:58.434 --> 28:59.502
Do you think...

28:59.622 --> 29:02.307
why you're looking for
another connection with him...

29:03.939 --> 29:05.763
Because he has Down syndrome?

29:07.022 --> 29:10.512
I mean, are you looking for
more ties with him because...

29:11.094 --> 29:14.635
- he's so different from us in other ways?
- I don't know.

29:15.222 --> 29:16.735
Maybe.

29:17.333 --> 29:18.897
I just know

29:19.439 --> 29:21.823
that when I think of
teaching him about Shabbat

29:22.269 --> 29:26.883
or imagine him getting married
under a chuppah someday...

29:27.227 --> 29:28.730
I get happy.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.772
Okay.

29:47.394 --> 29:50.351
I'm sorry you're disappointed with her.

29:50.796 --> 29:52.237
Aren't you?

29:53.728 --> 29:56.840
Feels good having saved
a young girl's life.

29:59.206 --> 30:01.380
I just wish she was more deserving.

30:03.328 --> 30:04.869
After I died,

30:05.327 --> 30:07.252
you went through some rough time.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.408
You did some things
you were not proud of.

30:10.528 --> 30:11.950
Yes?

30:13.475 --> 30:17.244
- It's true.
- Remember how angry you were at me

30:17.278 --> 30:20.107
for leaving you and
Regina when you were three?

30:21.479 --> 30:24.686
Everyone deserves a second chance.

30:25.963 --> 30:30.102
I'm grateful I got one with you.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.454
Ally.

32:29.718 --> 32:31.142
What are you doing here?

32:31.419 --> 32:32.885
I wanted to see it.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.788
And we both ended up
here at the same time?

32:37.568 --> 32:39.171
I've been here a while.

32:46.354 --> 32:48.116
It's just a regular old tree.

32:50.561 --> 32:53.001
You'd never know that someone died here.

32:54.819 --> 32:56.993
And someone was reborn.

32:59.671 --> 33:01.534
I really do have his heart.

33:03.003 --> 33:04.906
I don't like to think about him.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.863
He's dead and I'm alive.

33:13.541 --> 33:18.559
I wanted this, like,
mystical connection to you.

33:19.169 --> 33:21.242
I just wanted to feel him again.

33:21.993 --> 33:23.947
It wasn't fair to put that on you.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.517
I started to want that, too.

33:27.522 --> 33:29.611
Look, your sister was right.

33:30.295 --> 33:33.242
I did use. I do have a record.

33:33.847 --> 33:34.898
I just...

33:36.123 --> 33:37.636
I just thought announcing that

33:37.664 --> 33:39.195
wouldn't have been what
you guys wanted to hear.

33:39.234 --> 33:42.476
- If you had changed, or you were at least trying...
- I am trying.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.125
I don't use any more.

33:45.622 --> 33:47.718
And I really have been living in my car

33:47.746 --> 33:49.508
because my landlord was stalking me.

33:49.982 --> 33:52.918
I would have loved to go
to Italy with you guys.

33:55.273 --> 33:57.558
I wasn't lying about everything.

34:02.185 --> 34:06.539
And I am really sorry for making
you lose him all over again.

34:20.951 --> 34:22.233
Ally...

34:28.889 --> 34:30.725
I still want to do the tattoo.

34:33.085 --> 34:34.187
Uh...

34:34.864 --> 34:36.547
maybe not the feather.

34:40.501 --> 34:42.088
Something to honor him.

34:42.799 --> 34:44.234
I'd like that.

34:51.665 --> 34:53.472
Angelo's tree.

34:53.652 --> 34:54.918
I love it.

35:02.243 --> 35:06.445
- Um... can you just hold on one second?
- Yeah.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.582
What's going on?

35:22.780 --> 35:24.446
You're sure?

35:31.349 --> 35:32.852
I love you.

35:33.466 --> 35:34.885
Love you too.

35:49.588 --> 35:51.897
Uh,

35:52.461 --> 35:55.404
- is it cool if he...
- Takes pictures? Yeah.

35:55.410 --> 35:58.091
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.714
Okay.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.722
Okay. Ready?

36:13.123 --> 36:14.433
I'm so proud of you.

36:21.434 --> 36:22.500
Ready.

36:27.170 --> 36:29.443
I told you, I am not interested.

36:29.464 --> 36:32.288
- She has Angelo's DNA.
- That doesn't mean anything.

36:32.408 --> 36:34.794
He gave her a second chance at life.

36:34.822 --> 36:38.209
- I think that's worth celebrating.
- Then let her family celebrate.

36:38.904 --> 36:41.282
I lost my husband

36:41.402 --> 36:44.733
and I don't really want to think
about that every time I see her.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.138
She doesn't have any family.

36:47.387 --> 36:49.114
She's going through a hard time.

36:49.955 --> 36:53.558
What if I see her and
I don't feel anything?

36:53.773 --> 36:55.377
Oh, Mom...

36:57.275 --> 37:00.549
Honestly, I don't know
what I believe either.

37:00.871 --> 37:03.734
But maybe we should give
her a second chance, too.

37:07.817 --> 37:08.992
Jewish?

37:09.410 --> 37:11.364
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:11.844 --> 37:14.487
It's just religion means more
to her than it does to me.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.704
- That's not true. You're very spiritual.
- Mom, come on.

37:17.744 --> 37:20.584
- I haven't been to church in years.
- That's not your fault.

37:20.601 --> 37:21.810
I should have done a better job

37:21.844 --> 37:23.521
making sure it was a
bigger part of your life.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.220
You exposed it to me plenty.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.699
Organized religion is just not for me.

37:27.744 --> 37:30.325
- Okay, but can't we just raise him both ways?
- Mom,

37:30.929 --> 37:32.618
this is my family now.

37:33.736 --> 37:35.363
I have to put them first.

37:37.972 --> 37:39.737
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:40.928 --> 37:42.464
Are you mad at me?

37:42.694 --> 37:45.174
- No, sweetie...
- I'm sure this isn't easy for you.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.248
- I know it wouldn't be for me.
- It's just

37:47.248 --> 37:50.483
that my faith has given me such comfort.

37:50.603 --> 37:52.507
When my father died, when

37:52.986 --> 37:54.531
- Angelo passed...
- I know,

37:54.558 --> 37:56.180
and I respect that.

37:56.916 --> 37:59.035
And for me, it's all that,

37:59.049 --> 38:01.471
plus it's cultural.

38:02.171 --> 38:04.940
We have our own history.
Our own language.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.614
Our own food. Our own sense of humor.

38:07.826 --> 38:10.469
And everyone who's
Jewish is bonded by that,

38:10.501 --> 38:13.311
and I want my son to be in
that little circle with me.

38:14.187 --> 38:15.596
Can you understand that?

38:16.713 --> 38:18.533
Yes. I can.

38:18.931 --> 38:22.707
- So sorry I pushed...
- No, no, you meant well.

38:26.700 --> 38:28.674
I... I have a question.

38:28.837 --> 38:32.261
Can we still celebrate
Christmas and Easter?

38:32.722 --> 38:34.312
At your house, we can.

38:34.660 --> 38:38.478
At our house, we're going
to be celebrating Hanukkah,

38:38.938 --> 38:40.222
and...

38:40.778 --> 38:42.160
What's the other big one?

38:42.196 --> 38:43.452
Passover.

38:43.678 --> 38:44.781
That one.

38:44.901 --> 38:47.495
I'm going to be taking
some classes very soon.

38:47.496 --> 38:48.828
And so will I.

38:50.007 --> 38:51.123
Thank you.

38:58.234 --> 38:59.503
Hey, Mom.

39:00.090 --> 39:01.414
This is Ally.

39:03.647 --> 39:04.776
Hi.

39:05.838 --> 39:07.541
Ally, this is Regina.

39:09.408 --> 39:12.249
I am so sorry for the
way I went about this.

39:13.234 --> 39:15.005
For all the pain you've been through.

39:17.327 --> 39:20.705
I promise I will try to live
my life to be worthy of him.

39:22.286 --> 39:23.623
Your necklace.

39:24.870 --> 39:26.099
What is that?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.543
It's a prism.

39:31.516 --> 39:33.744
I like to be surrounded by light.

39:49.443 --> 39:50.753
This is the key...

39:51.223 --> 39:53.798
to the house that Angelo
and I were building.

39:53.918 --> 39:56.625
Our first apartment
together had terrible light.

39:56.815 --> 39:59.091
We spent half the time in darkness.

39:59.344 --> 40:00.930
He gave me this.

40:01.165 --> 40:04.264
And he said we would never
live in the dark again.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.513
You never told us that.

40:09.892 --> 40:11.369
I know.

40:18.142 --> 40:20.315
Would it be okay if I hugged you?

40:45.545 --> 40:48.858
I feel him.

40:50.792 --> 40:52.952
I feel his heart.

41:08.948 --> 41:11.341
It's nice to meet you, Ally.
