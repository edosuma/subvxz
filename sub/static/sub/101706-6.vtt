11:17.711 --> 11:19.713
There's just so many favors
I can squeeze out of GND.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.283
If Darryl keeps spending
time in public with Leroy,

11:23.416 --> 11:24.517
he's gonna get
flagged again.

11:24.651 --> 11:25.618
Understood.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.356
You're welcome.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.160
Thank you, sir.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.499
Hey.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.172
(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

11:48.008 --> 11:50.110
Amen, my friends.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.545
Praise the Lord
and pass the plate.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.848
Give until it hurts.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.684
Because we sacrifice
for God

11:57.818 --> 12:00.420
to prove our faith
in Him.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.690
Our love for Him.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.725
And we will be blessed
with great rewards

12:05.859 --> 12:07.160
now and forever after.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.661
WOMAN: Amen.
MAN: Amen, brother.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.965
(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)

12:12.099 --> 12:13.934
Second Corinthians 9:7 says

12:14.067 --> 12:16.203
"God loves a cheerful giver."

12:16.336 --> 12:19.172
So don't skimp on
the Lord, my friends.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.175
Put some legs
on all your faith,

12:22.309 --> 12:25.979
all your prayers
and all your worship.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.459
Hi.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.830
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

12:47.200 --> 12:48.936
JUANITA: Hello.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.103
Did you enjoy
the service?

12:50.237 --> 12:51.939
I haven't been
to church in a while.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.107
Welcome back
to God's house.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.608
How long have you guys
been, uh, coming here?

12:55.742 --> 12:57.444
Um, three years
now, Henry?
HENRY: Mm-hmm.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.847
Church keeps
getting bigger.
And better.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.616
Services seven days a week,
morning, afternoon, evening.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.386
The bishop is here
for the Blessed.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.355
You were generous today,
with the collection.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.824
The ATMs make it easy
to get cash.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.894
Most of us just tithe directly
from our bank accounts,
to avoid the fees.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.562
HENRY: And the cash limits.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.631
Like the bishop preaches,
it takes money to make money.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.367
On Earth
as it is in heaven.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.534
Mm, praise the Lord.
There's money in heaven?

13:22.870 --> 13:25.405
You don't believe
the Bible, sister?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.140
Welcome to the Kingdom
of the Blessed.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.142
What's your
name, sister?
Christina.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.345
Well, I know how Juanita
and Henry came to be
God's servants,

13:32.479 --> 13:33.646
but how'd the Lord
choose you, Christina?

13:33.780 --> 13:35.448
You'd have to ask Her.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.950
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

13:39.252 --> 13:40.587
You're not a believer.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.955
Well, that's how
I used to think,

13:42.089 --> 13:43.756
and then I met Zoey,
and she told me
about the Kingdom

13:43.891 --> 13:44.624
and all the good work
that you do.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.126
Your mission.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.594
I thought Zoey
would be here today.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.196
She's here.
She's in the girls' dorm.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.998
Part of our
youth outreach.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.966
We have an early-morning
prayer meeting
for the residents.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.567
They have
a different taste
in music.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.969
Is it okay
if I say hi to her?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.304
I'll walk you over.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.476
Girls on this side
of the compound,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.879
boys on that side,
as far away
as we can put them.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.680
And we still have
to lock the doors.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.149
Like your mom
did, right?

14:09.282 --> 14:10.984
You don't know
my family.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.685
I know you, Christina.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.327
Visitor for you, Zoey.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.696
It was a beautiful service,
like you said.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.498
Lot of good people
under one roof.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.267
Christina wants to learn more
about our youth program,

14:28.201 --> 14:29.536
which depends
entirely upon

14:29.669 --> 14:32.172
the generosity of individual
donors such as yourself.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.673
Stay as long
as you like.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.008
We have no secrets here.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.209
My mom liked to say

14:36.343 --> 14:37.677
"No secret
is the biggest secret of all."

14:37.810 --> 14:38.878
God rest her soul.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.215
Or you wouldn't have
used the past tense.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.151
Come back soon.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.390
(DOOR CLOSES)

14:50.523 --> 14:51.491
What do you want?

14:51.624 --> 14:52.659
Are you here by choice?

14:52.792 --> 14:56.296
I was living on a sidewalk
before this.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.265
Here is better
than wherever
there used to be,

14:58.398 --> 14:59.499
for all of us.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.101
Do you understand?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.835
Dylan thinks
you're in trouble.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.037
So he told a cop?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.740
Look, I'm fine, okay?
I made a mistake with him.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.877
And I knew better.
Every family has rules.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.980
And punishments?
Like your hair?

15:13.113 --> 15:15.182
The bishop
gives us a home.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.416
He brings us
closer to God.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.087
I don't want something
to happen to Dylan
because I was stupid.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.188
You think he's in danger?

15:21.321 --> 15:22.289
You're gonna
make it worse.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.124
Zoey, who would hurt him?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.260
You can talk to me.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.696
I'm not getting sent
to the Yellow House.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.098
What does that mean?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.000
Can you just go away? Please?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.803
Dylan gave me your number.
I'm texting you mine.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
I'll delete it.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.673
Up to you.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.409
Something's so wrong there.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.843
It's like they've all
been hypnotized.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.146
This couple I met,
turns out they got
a second trust deed

15:46.279 --> 15:47.880
on their little house
and gave Miller
all the money.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.216
It was their nest egg.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.583
Church donations
aren't illegal.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.420
I'm not willing
to wait for God
to judge, all right?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.455
What about slave labor,
domestic violence,

15:55.588 --> 15:57.690
unlawful restraint,
financial abuse?

15:57.824 --> 15:59.926
We have a duty,
don't we? As cops?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.394
Who have you already
talked to about this?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.163
You, Deacon.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.364
Well, you got
to follow protocol.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.932
Take it to Vice
or Human Trafficking.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.300
Without evidence
or eyewitnesses

16:07.434 --> 16:08.968
or a verified crime?
Nothing happens.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.337
We're not detectives,
Chris.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.239
We're out of uniform,
we're off duty,

16:12.372 --> 16:13.406
so I'm gonna tell you
that's some BS.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.808
What have you both done
on your own time

16:15.942 --> 16:16.776
because it was
the right thing?

16:18.278 --> 16:20.613
I know a sergeant in North
Hollywood Division, Bob Garza.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.582
I'll check in
with him tomorrow,
get the lowdown.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.817
What about right now?
(CHUCKLES) Alonso,
you are tough, aren't you?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.220
That's why you love me.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.588
All right, Deac, go on.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.157
Chris obviously ain't
giving this up.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.291
I'll clear it with Hicks.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.034
Hey, what's going on, Tan?

16:41.168 --> 16:43.170
The wedding's off.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.805
You're kidding.
What'd you do?

16:45.938 --> 16:48.341
Nothing.
The hotel canceled on us.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.976
Can't even guarantee
a new date.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.978
There's always
Deacon's backyard.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.182
Not with 300-plus guests.
I've stopped counting heads.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.184
There's so much family
to offend on both sides
of the aisle.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.385
And now there's no aisle.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.553
The beach is big.
And cheap.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.954
Yeah, neither one
of our moms

17:02.089 --> 17:03.590
is gonna walk across
sand for this.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.991
Not barefoot
and definitely
not in heels.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.859
You could always elope.

17:06.993 --> 17:10.230
I'm not about to let Bonnie
miss out on her dream
wedding by eloping.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.465
No way.
We just got to wait.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.033
How's she doing with that?

17:14.167 --> 17:15.335
We're philosophical.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.869
Both of you?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.138
Bonnie's fine.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.510
You saw her.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.179
You get it.
She's-she's brainwashed.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.647
Zoey's worried about you.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.250
Her real name is Abby.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.552
From A to Z, right?

17:32.685 --> 17:34.654
As far away
as she could get
from her father,

17:34.787 --> 17:35.988
who used to like to crawl
in bed with her at night.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.493
He called it their-their
"Rock-a-bye Baby time."

17:41.894 --> 17:44.397
Now she ends up
with another version
of the same thing.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.532
Except this one's
hiding behind God.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.601
They were never
gonna hunt us down.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.670
There's always another
kid for the corner.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.240
She just
had to walk away.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.408
Miller would've moved on
to somebody else.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.344
I get the impression
he doesn't let go easy.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.579
Yeah, but we would've been
in San Francisco by now.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.713
Way out of reach.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.782
Did she ever mention
the Yellow House?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.685
The monster
under the bed? Yeah.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.820
The hellmouth. Th...

18:07.954 --> 18:09.889
That's how Miller
keeps them all in check.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.159
Is that an actual place?
With an address
this side of eternity?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.693
I don't, I don't know.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.928
If Zoey calls you...
So you're done?

18:16.062 --> 18:18.131
So that, that's it?
She doesn't want to leave.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.299
I-I can't force her.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.436
Why'd I ever bother
talking to you?

18:37.217 --> 18:38.885
Get in. Now.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.087
(GRUNTING)

18:41.221 --> 18:42.689
Let's go.
Help!

18:42.822 --> 18:44.257
(TIRES SCREECHING)

18:49.429 --> 18:51.931
Hondo, I think
Zoey's boyfriend
just got snatched.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.640
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

19:00.773 --> 19:02.008
They're still talking.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.010
Courtesy takes
a minute, Chris.
Settle down.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.179
This is Garza's division.
We're just guests
at the party.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.649
We got onto this
phony pastor pretty quick
after he set up shop.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.084
Lot of red flags,
nothing ever sticks.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.120
How about kidnapping
witnessed by a team member?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.322
Unless the boy
went voluntarily.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.589
Your officer
couldn't see it.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.957
Miller's got these kids
panhandling all day

19:18.090 --> 19:19.792
to stay in the shelter.
It-it's forced labor.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.230
Volunteers for the Lord,
with a business license
from the city.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.897
You don't get a license
for false imprisonment
and abuse.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.667
No evidence,
no probable cause.
He's slick as slime.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.102
Feel free to nail his ass.
I've tried.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.172
Miller invited me back.
It's not trespass,
I'm a guest.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.475
I'll keep my phone mic hot
so you have audio.
Am I good to go?

19:35.608 --> 19:36.976
You're only here
to gather information,

19:37.109 --> 19:39.178
see if there's
any real danger.
This is not a mission.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.480
I understand
the difference, Hondo.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.452
Don't make me sorry.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.622
Hell, I'm already sorry.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.000
I'm looking for Zoey.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.203
I'm a friend of hers.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.638
She...
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:09.576 --> 20:11.378
Do you need a meal, Christina?

20:11.511 --> 20:12.845
CHRIS: <i>No thanks, Bishop.</i>

20:12.979 --> 20:14.180
I just came to see Zoey.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.948
Is she around?
It's after visiting hours.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.518
I'll walk you out.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.324
You think he's onto her?

20:24.457 --> 20:25.658
He's smart.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.129
Even peace officers need God.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.434
And usually a warrant.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.669
L.A.P.D.?

20:36.803 --> 20:37.870
I'm here
as Zoey's friend.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.606
If you were her friend,
you'd know that she left

20:39.739 --> 20:41.474
the Kingdom
without telling us.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.176
<i>And I hope she brings that man</i>
<i>of hers back to the Lord</i>
<i>and they find their way home,</i>

20:44.311 --> 20:46.212
<i>but God lets us</i>
<i>make our own choices.</i>

20:46.346 --> 20:50.016
Good and bad. Free will.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.518
Why do you keep
the kids locked up?

20:51.651 --> 20:54.253
They're not kids,
they're adults, all of them.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.423
We enforce an early curfew
for their safety,

20:56.556 --> 21:00.259
and each building
has an emergency exit
with an alarm.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.028
Zero risk to the residents.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.096
I appreciate
how much you care.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.632
I'm being real with you.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.434
They're locked in,
but not locked out?

21:07.567 --> 21:08.568
So everybody
can come home, yes.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.370
Miller's not even worried.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.704
Well, that's his weakness.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.406
He doesn't think
we can't touch him.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.074
So far he's right.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.711
You're not here all
by yourself, Christina.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.081
You have backup listening.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.950
Peace be with you, Officers.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.284
(SCOFFS)

21:25.418 --> 21:26.453
I hate this man.

21:26.586 --> 21:27.720
I'm gonna pray for Zoey.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.523
And you, too, Christina.
Don't bother.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.126
Even hopeless sinners
need prayer.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.431
So Dylan gets grabbed
and Zoey goes missing

21:38.565 --> 21:40.433
and the guy plays like
he's God's best friend.

21:40.567 --> 21:41.501
We'll put out a BOLO
for both of them.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.071
A bishop? What?
He's no real
kind of bishop.

21:45.204 --> 21:46.305
He just likes the way
the word sounds.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.807
To make himself legit.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.308
Well, you're not a deacon,
either, are you?

21:49.442 --> 21:50.743
It doesn't matter.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.244
He's a felon
without a jacket,
he's a predator

21:52.379 --> 21:54.481
hiding behind his twisted
readings of the Bible.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.115
Dial your heat down, Alonso.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.850
We got two missing victims,
Commander.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.251
That no one has
officially reported.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.653
I'm reporting it.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.489
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

22:02.622 --> 22:03.956
Okay, fine.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.092
But you stay
on call tomorrow,
like every day off.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.527
S.W.A.T. takes
priority, copy?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.196
Copy that.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.765
And don't go thinking
you're some kind of
damn task force.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.739
All the good people
sure this place is holy,

22:19.872 --> 22:21.374
getting hustled out
of their paycheck

22:21.508 --> 22:24.444
so Miller can dress sharp
and live big and ride around
in flashy cars.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.479
God's pimp.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.981
At least a pimp
on the corner's honest
about his services.

22:29.115 --> 22:32.585
Well, Miller's proof
that prayer works.
What?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.921
He's showing off
his direct connection
to God.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.489
He's got them
convinced that

22:36.623 --> 22:38.324
he's their last chance
for rewards on Earth.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.360
That he can save them,
for a price.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.662
That's beyond ugly.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.097
And protected
by the First Amendment.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.365
You're gonna pray
for the sinner?

22:47.567 --> 22:48.801
I think I'll pray
for more saints.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.340
(INAUDIBLE)

22:54.474 --> 22:55.875
That's the girl
who had something
to tell me.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.209
Let's try
to get her alone.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.021
What's up, Leroy?

23:10.490 --> 23:13.493
Why you here?

23:13.626 --> 23:16.062
Gang and Narcotics
opened a new file on Darryl
as a gang associate.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.831
You play like
you got pull.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.332
There's surveillance photos
of him hanging

23:20.467 --> 23:21.668
with a known gang member,
which is you.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.670
I'm being watched?
(SCOFFS)

23:23.803 --> 23:25.905
Come on, now.
Waste of taxpayer money.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.274
I'm too old to matter
to the young Gs, man.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.409
I'm out of the game.
I'm shut out of the game.
Come on, man.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.579
Blood in, blood out.
You're still a Hammer.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.080
A triple OG.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.315
All by yourself, you made
Darryl a gang associate.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.184
Look, all I'm saying

23:38.317 --> 23:39.919
is maybe you should hang back
for a bit to protect Darryl.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.721
Yeah, you keep
finding reasons

23:41.854 --> 23:43.856
to keep me away from
my boy, don't you?

23:43.990 --> 23:46.593
Just until GND
loses interest in you, man.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.860
You're still
a hot subject.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.562
Yeah, and how long
is that gonna take?

23:49.696 --> 23:51.263
Sometime between
now and never?

23:51.397 --> 23:53.900
You asked me to
do right by Darryl
because you couldn't.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.902
I'm just trying to honor
my promise to you.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.404
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Big man. Big talk.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.640
Leroy, you are welcome
to visit Darryl at home

24:00.773 --> 24:02.374
as often as you want
for as long as you like.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.276
Just not in public
where y'all can get seen.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.778
Oh, man,
this country been

24:05.912 --> 24:07.847
breaking up Black families
for centuries.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.717
So, that's a problem with
the system, not with me.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.884
Oh, so you're
Malcolm X now?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.653
Yo, I've done my time.
All right?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.989
I'm gonna enjoy my freedom,
no thanks to you,
and I won't forget.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.291
(SCOFFS)
You ain't gonna put me

24:19.425 --> 24:22.028
under some kind
of house arrest
to see my boy.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.262
Are you done
listening to yourself?

24:24.831 --> 24:27.299
Hey, why don't
I come by later?

24:27.433 --> 24:30.169
We let Darryl
make up his own damn mind.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.505
I mean, you and me,
we was grown-ass men
at 17.

24:32.639 --> 24:33.472
Okay, but he ain't.

24:33.606 --> 24:34.707
Whose fault is that?

24:35.742 --> 24:37.043
I'm doing my best, Leroy.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.077
Same here.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.924
So, where's home?

24:52.058 --> 24:54.761
You're a cop, aren't you?
What do you want?

24:54.894 --> 24:56.663
Just talk to us
about Zoey.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.165
You wanted to tell me
something last night.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.534
If the bishop finds out,
he'll send me
to the Yellow House.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.169
Then you better
talk fast.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.271
Second time I've heard
about the Yellow House.
What is it?

25:05.404 --> 25:09.842
It's the self-improvement
center for hopeless sinners.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.678
I think that's
where he put Zoey.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.212
No one comes
back the same.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.346
Where is this place?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.882
I don't know.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.116
I don't ever
want to know.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.520
This girl,
this young woman...
Jenn.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.990
She's never been to what
they call the Yellow House.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.925
If it's even real.
The fear is real.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.326
And you both believed her?

25:27.459 --> 25:29.461
100%.
All right.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.497
We could access the
automatic plate reader

25:31.631 --> 25:33.666
and see where this "BLESSED"
car's been riding around.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.967
If they're careless
and we get lucky,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.136
we might be able
to find the block.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.771
DEACON: And if
we can narrow
it to an address

25:38.905 --> 25:40.306
that matches
the description,

25:40.439 --> 25:42.274
Garza could
take a couple unis,
do a welfare check.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.542
That's a lot
of ifs and maybes.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.311
While Zoey and Dylan
and how many other kids

25:45.444 --> 25:46.913
are going through
who knows
what kind of hell.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.848
Chris, do you
have a better plan that
you want to share?

25:49.982 --> 25:51.017
No, sir.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.791
Hey. Any more
wedding news?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.994
Yeah. We decided to
hit pause on the whole thing
for a minute.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.330
I'm never gonna tell Bonnie,
but I'm kind of relieved.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.397
I can breathe again.

26:05.531 --> 26:06.666
(CHUCKLES)
That doesn't sound good.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.200
All the planning,

26:08.334 --> 26:10.202
family drama
around every single choice.

26:10.336 --> 26:13.572
Color of the cocktail napkins.
Nobody notices. Who cares?

26:13.706 --> 26:14.741
I'm guessing the mothers.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.108
And the sisters.
Correct.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.778
You know, I've never
seen two people

26:18.911 --> 26:20.112
better together
than you and Bonnie.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.547
Who are you, Dear Abby?

26:21.681 --> 26:23.382
Pretty sure she's dead.
(GRUNTS) Lucky her.

26:23.515 --> 26:24.651
No more worries.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.218
What do you
have to worry about?

26:26.352 --> 26:27.720
You get paid

26:27.854 --> 26:29.756
to do a job
with a purpose.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.523
Your family's healthy.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.125
You're living
in a safe zone

26:33.259 --> 26:35.561
with the lady you love.
Your life's beautiful.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.797
I don't know.
Starting to feel
like high-stakes poker.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.766
You bet big, you lose big.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.333
So now you're afraid
of happiness?

26:41.467 --> 26:42.835
That's some
existential crap.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.336
What if something
happens to me?

26:44.470 --> 26:46.105
What if something
happens to her?

26:46.238 --> 26:47.406
Till death do us part?

26:47.539 --> 26:48.941
What if it does?

26:49.075 --> 26:50.977
Okay, that'd be tragic,

26:51.110 --> 26:54.146
but loneliness
is lousy insurance.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.883
You gonna spend
the rest of your life
flying solo?

26:57.016 --> 26:58.450
Maybe it's just
wedding jitters.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.387
Yeah, maybe.

made it to the porch.

27:24.977 --> 27:25.978
We took fire
through the front door.

in this cage?

29:58.898 --> 30:00.066
I don't know.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.134
Long enough to repent
from offending the Lord.

30:02.668 --> 30:03.769
For what?

30:03.903 --> 30:06.772
I bought a lipstick
with money from donations.

in here, Carla?

judging him, and...

And then the gun
went off.

didn't answer me
anymore.
