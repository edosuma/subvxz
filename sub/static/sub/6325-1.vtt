00:40.415 --> 00:44.293
- All present and accounted for, sir.
- Thank you, captain.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.218
As of this moment...

00:53.720 --> 00:59.349
...you are the property of the
Penal Administration of French Guiana.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.812
After serving your
full terms in prison...

01:04.313 --> 01:07.066
...those of you with sentences...

01:07.233 --> 01:10.069
...of eight years or more...

01:10.236 --> 01:11.987
...will remain in Guiana...

01:12.322 --> 01:14.865
...as workers and colonists...

01:15.033 --> 01:19.286
...for a period equal
to that of your original sentences.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.289
As for France...

01:22.457 --> 01:24.958
...the nation has disposed of you.

01:25.710 --> 01:29.171
France has rid
herself of you altogether.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.718
Forget France and put your clothes on.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.919
Papillon. Papi.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.505
You'll be back, Papillon.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.050
Don't worry, you'll be back.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.225
No, you won't.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.280
You, that way.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.866
Down there. You too. You too.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.202
Next. Next, over here. Come along.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.996
Come on. Come in here. Yeah.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.498
You too. You too.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.500
Over there. Over there.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.254
Come along, up there. Hurry up.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.132
You too. You too. Down.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.804
Down. In there. In there.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.473
Come along, now. Down.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.643
Come on down. Down there.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.109
Come on, up there.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.318
In there. In there.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.801
We're really something, aren't we?

06:25.968 --> 06:29.471
The only animals in the world that
shove things up their ass for survival.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.391
First time I shoved one up my gut...

06:32.558 --> 06:36.645
...it infected me so bad
the camp doctor had to cut it out.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.980
He doesn't have any ether...

06:39.148 --> 06:41.650
...so he knocks me out with rum.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.820
- Then you know what he did?
- He stole it.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.242
The butterfly.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.161
You're Papillon, aren't you?

06:53.329 --> 06:54.621
Yeah.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.623
The bastards gave you life.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.669
Right to the end of the line,
they think.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.296
May not be as long as you think.

07:03.464 --> 07:07.384
Forty percent of us will die
the first year out.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.014
They gave him life too.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.641
Kid's only 18.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.353
Look at him. No wonder he dreams.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.106
He'll never make it.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.029
But a man like you could make it,
if you have enough money.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.199
How long were you there?

07:31.367 --> 07:35.954
Nine years of work camp,
nine years a colonist.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.207
You were outside the walls.
Why didn't you run?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.543
There's no place to run to.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.421
You're in the middle of a swamp,
1000 miles from no place.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.716
Now, if you got a lot of money,
that's a different thing.

07:47.884 --> 07:52.053
I mean, you take somebody
like Dega there. Back there.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.224
Louis Dega.
The best counterfeiter in France.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.477
National Defense Bonds.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.563
- Series of 1928.
- Right.

08:02.356 --> 08:07.235
Now, if you've got money like he has,
there's a chance to buy your way out.

08:07.445 --> 08:12.824
That is unless somebody cuts his guts
open first to get at all that cash.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.827
Everybody up! Let's go!

08:15.995 --> 08:17.037
Everybody up!

08:17.205 --> 08:20.832
Come on, everybody up!
Let's go! Let's go!

08:50.279 --> 08:52.822
Mind if I sit down here?

08:53.950 --> 08:56.076
If you wish.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.832
You're Dega, aren't you? Louis Dega?

09:06.462 --> 09:07.796
Sorry to see you here.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.383
I presume most of us have earned
our passage.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.346
You're Papillon. You got life for killing
a pimp. Then you had the bad taste...

09:16.514 --> 09:19.432
...to tell the prosecutor
you were going to kill him too.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.197
I was framed for that murder.
I'm innocent.

09:21.297 --> 09:22.894
No one is innocent.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.982
I'm no pimp killer, for chrissake.
I'm a safecracker.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.859
That's a profession of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.489
I put almost everything I had
into National Defense Bonds.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.450
Series of 1928.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.869
1928?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.291
Your instincts were sound.
How much did you lose?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.919
I wouldn't put my money on those bonds,
not any more than you would.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.504
Oh. I'm relieved to hear that.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.716
But if that's true,
then why are we having this little chat?

09:54.885 --> 09:58.179
Every convict on this ship knows
who you are.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.975
Any of them would slit you open to reach
inside and get what you're carrying.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.144
So?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.354
You need protection.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.441
From you?

10:13.321 --> 10:15.572
You remember what the chicken said
to the weasel?

10:17.033 --> 10:20.535
If he was a healthy weasel, the chicken
didn't get a chance to say anything.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.288
Think about that.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.102
Hose down!

10:46.270 --> 10:49.147
Come on, off your asses! Hose down!

10:55.696 --> 10:59.324
Come on, you got a fever.
Come on. Do what I tell you.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.034
Come on.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.744
Julot.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.665
Got a question.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.169
If I wanted to get a boat when I got there,
small boat, maybe 15-footer...

11:11.337 --> 11:13.588
- ...how much would it cost?
- Thirty-five hundred.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.799
Forty-five maybe. It all depends.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.218
What if I could
pick up the money to buy one?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.095
I guess you'd have yourself a boat.

11:20.262 --> 11:23.431
You know the country. You and I
could make it out of there. Huh?

11:23.599 --> 11:27.435
The answer is no. Nothing against you,
but the answer is no.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.939
If I gotta go to solitary for some
half-assed escape that didn't work...

11:31.107 --> 11:34.359
...I want the mistake to be mine,
not anybody else's. You understand?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.611
The answer is no.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.480
How'd it feel, kid?
Come on, spit it. Spit.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.492
Come on, kid. Spit it up.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.989
All right. Come on, move it.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.206
Move it a little.
Move it a little. Let's go.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.544
Let's move.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.818
What do you want?

13:39.985 --> 13:42.654
Almost unbearable, isn't it?

13:43.405 --> 13:46.407
- What?
- Heat.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.742
Oh, it's not too bad.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.495
Of course,
you're closer to it than I am.

13:50.955 --> 13:55.333
Oh, yes, yes. You're referring
to last night, aren't you?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.544
Well, aren't you?

13:57.711 --> 13:59.337
May I tell you something?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.924
At first glance, I'm afraid
that I regarded you with rather...

14:03.092 --> 14:06.719
...a large degree of, uh,
unworthy suspicion.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.888
- Am I clear?
- No.

14:09.181 --> 14:13.768
Well, it now seems quite possible that,
until we get to a decent jail...

14:13.936 --> 14:18.982
...with bribable guards,
I may stand in some need of...

14:19.441 --> 14:21.734
...rather close physical protection.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.988
That depends on how long
you wanna live.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.781
Oh, a long time.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.535
Well, then you got a problem.

14:31.370 --> 14:37.041
Well, I presume that you have some, uh,
goal, some particular need that...

14:37.209 --> 14:39.627
...outweighs all others.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.922
I mean, if so, uh, may I ask what it is?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.216
- Money.
- For what?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.759
Escape.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.304
Very good.

14:49.805 --> 14:53.349
You keep me alive
until we land in Guiana...

14:53.517 --> 14:56.019
...and I'll underwrite any escape
you care to arrange.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.814
Escape for me, not for us.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.482
Oh, of course. I, uh...

15:01.650 --> 15:06.988
Ha, ha. I have no intention
of even attempting an escape. Ever.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.159
Done.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.121
Thank you.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.902
Leave him alone,
or I'll cut your head off.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.281
Hide this.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.437
Over there is St. Joseph's.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.731
The other island is Royale.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.441
The one on the right is Devil's.

17:07.192 --> 17:11.695
Julot, why is it so hard
to escape from there?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.740
A man could almost swim
to the mainland.

17:13.906 --> 17:16.159
No, there must be a better way
than swimming.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.077
No, no, swimming's not the way.

17:18.244 --> 17:22.290
The current is so strong, it'll push you
right back where you started from.

17:22.458 --> 17:26.669
You know, when you're on those islands,
you're there for keeps.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.300
Where do we go?

17:33.635 --> 17:35.219
We go up the Maroni River.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.638
Then we dock at Saint-Laurent.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.892
That's where they decide
whether to send you to the work camps...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.643
...or to the islands.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.605
Left. Left. Left.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.565
Left, right, left.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.567
Left. Left.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.277
Left, right, left.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.211
Column, halt.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.506
Left.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.645
See those two on the dock with the guns?
Right over there.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.400
They served their time,
and now they're colonists.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.195
- They've turned man hunter.
- Man hunter?

18:35.030 --> 18:36.989
Yeah, you escape, they hunt.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.617
For money, I presume. A reward.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.245
- Jesus.
- All right. Get ready to move.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.705
Line up to disembark.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.938
I'm gonna have an accident going down
that gangplank, and it's gotta look good...

19:09.106 --> 19:11.732
- ...so lend me your shiv.
- What the hell for?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.401
Because I'm a two-time loser.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.988
No matter what happens, I'll be sent
to the islands on the next transport.

19:17.156 --> 19:21.284
I've gotta get into that hospital to give
me time to think. Now give me that shiv.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.942
You're crazy, Julot.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.404
- Single file. March.
- Single file down the gangplank.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.420
Hold it. Hold it.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.193
Let's go.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.570
Single file.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.869
Move. Move. Let's go.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.205
Bring a stretcher.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.918
Single file, single file.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.172
- Move him out.
- Take him away.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.341
- Move it.
- All right, move. Move.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.218
- All right, let's go.
- Move it.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.367
Come on, move them. Let's go. Let's go.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.787
Come on. Come on.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.581
- Get up. Come on.
- Get up there. Off your ass.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.836
- Come on.
- Line them up. Right there.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.546
Come on.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.091
Get in the rank.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.969
Come up over here.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.637
Come on.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.181
Hurry it up.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.405
Column, march.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.780
Keep moving. Keep moving.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.361
Prisoner, pick him up quickly.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.390
Attention!

24:45.233 --> 24:47.776
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

24:47.944 --> 24:49.361
...of French Guiana...

24:50.071 --> 24:52.281
...whose prisoners you are...

24:52.449 --> 24:54.992
...and from which there is no escape.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.037
First attempts at escape...

24:58.205 --> 25:02.416
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.127
Second attempts add five more.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.422
Of course, more serious offenses...

25:08.590 --> 25:12.968
...are dealt with in this fashion.

25:20.602 --> 25:26.148
Make the best of what we offer you,
and you will suffer less than you deserve.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.025
Dismissed.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.240
Into the bunkhouse.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.159
One, two, three, four.

25:37.327 --> 25:40.120
Go on! Go on! Get a move on!

25:47.420 --> 25:48.837
Mr. Dega?

25:49.297 --> 25:52.758
Oh, yes, indeed.
I know all about you, Mr. Dega.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.134
Very intelligent man.

25:54.302 --> 25:57.680
Thank you. I, uh-- I seem to be known
in all the wrong places.

25:57.847 --> 26:02.309
Well, I have a friend who is a guard.
For very--

26:02.644 --> 26:03.644
Yes, go ahead.

26:03.812 --> 26:08.649
For very little money, he can arrange
for certain people to stay here...

26:08.817 --> 26:12.820
...instead of being sent to a work camp
or one of the islands.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.864
Can he get us a job here
so we can walk around the place?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.659
Perhaps a selection from which
we may choose?

26:18.827 --> 26:21.870
Oh, yes. That is, my friend can.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.582
You take our money,
and you put your life on the line.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.959
Mm. Of course.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.794
How much will it cost?

26:28.962 --> 26:34.008
Well, my friend has a very large family.
Many little children, you understand?

26:34.175 --> 26:36.969
And his sergeant has a mother,
heart trouble.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.221
He was asking you how much,
not how many.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.016
If you don't mind,
I'll do the negotiating.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.936
How much?

26:46.104 --> 26:50.691
For you, 500. For him, 1500.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.568
He made trouble.

26:52.736 --> 26:58.240
Yes, indeed, he did. Nevertheless,
I'll give you 1250 for the both of us.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.660
Now, you take it or leave it as you wish.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.596
Try again.

27:20.764 --> 27:24.308
Very well. I want two pairs of
comfortable shoes for the both of us...

27:24.476 --> 27:27.269
...and you, you get the 2000.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.772
Don't you have to go to the toilet?

27:29.939 --> 27:32.650
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you excuse me a moment?

27:32.817 --> 27:37.029
You don't need to, Mr. Dega.
Unless, of course, you want to.

27:37.197 --> 27:40.074
I can pick it up in the morning.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.944
Get moving, white men!

28:17.112 --> 28:19.947
Let's go! Right now! Okay! Let's go!

28:20.115 --> 28:21.281
Come on, move it!

28:21.449 --> 28:23.325
On your feet!

28:24.077 --> 28:26.120
- Come on, get up.
- Move it! Come on!

28:26.830 --> 28:28.580
Come on!

29:08.204 --> 29:12.583
Attention! Present arms!

29:19.924 --> 29:22.509
No! No!

29:23.178 --> 29:26.346
"Deliver your servant, O Lord,
from all the dangers of hell...

29:26.514 --> 29:30.100
- ...from constraining punishments...
- No!

29:30.268 --> 29:31.560
Amen."

29:33.521 --> 29:35.606
May the angels take him...

29:48.578 --> 29:52.206
Mr. Dega, did you get the money?

29:57.378 --> 30:00.047
Move it! Move it! Move it!

30:02.592 --> 30:03.967
Get going! Move it!

30:07.055 --> 30:08.555
Fischer, what the hell's wrong?

30:08.723 --> 30:11.892
Some son of a bitch broke out
of the hospital compound.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.186
Julot.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.688
All right, break it up. We'll get him.

30:17.649 --> 30:26.240
Next.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.748
You're fine. Next.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.543
Must be better than I feel.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.420
You're in wonderful shape.

30:40.588 --> 30:43.298
Hey, how do you fail
an examination like this?

30:43.466 --> 30:44.758
Next.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.847
7551.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.311
- Dega?
- Yes, sir, Louis Dega.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.434
It was suggested
that I speak to you, sir--

30:58.534 --> 30:59.690
I have it right here.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.110
We'll just keep you on here
in the cleaning squad.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.237
Thank you, sir. There's also my friend.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.652
You're Louis Dega?

31:06.752 --> 31:09.199
I am, sir.
And this is my friend, Papillon.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.786
We have a great deal in common,
Mr. Dega. I'm extremely glad to see you.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.873
Why, thank you, sir.
Of course, if the circumstances were--

31:16.040 --> 31:19.793
My family lost everything they had
in counterfeit National Defense Bonds.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.591
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

31:25.758 --> 31:30.804
Uh, even so, buying them was a tribute
to their patriotism, wouldn't you say?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.892
- And you're Mr. Dega's friend, huh?
- Well, we--

31:35.059 --> 31:37.311
There's one thing about Saint-Laurent
you'll like:

31:37.478 --> 31:40.314
We never separate old friends.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.483
Kilo 40. Both of them.
Today's transport.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.118
What is Kilo 40?

31:56.331 --> 31:59.374
Ready, heave!

31:59.834 --> 32:03.337
Ready, pull!

32:04.756 --> 32:07.049
Ready, heave!

32:07.216 --> 32:12.012
Ready, pull! Move!

32:12.472 --> 32:14.014
Heave!

32:14.182 --> 32:16.850
Don't touch him.
You'll wind up worse off than he is.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.226
Move! Get moving!

32:22.607 --> 32:24.524
Ready, aim...

32:25.026 --> 32:26.068
Duck!

32:26.235 --> 32:27.861
Pull!

32:29.530 --> 32:31.657
Get up, you lazy bastards!

32:31.824 --> 32:33.784
You get that croc
and you bring him along!

32:33.952 --> 32:36.870
You, pick another man
and grab that croc.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.133
Move! Come on, move!

32:50.301 --> 32:52.803
Move! Move!

33:11.656 --> 33:13.991
Son of a bitch isn't dead,
they just irritated him.

33:14.158 --> 33:17.202
- Get his tail.
- You get his tail.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.580
- Where's his tail?
- Go there.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.085
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.586
- So am I.
- Go ahead.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.422
Okay.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.468
Ready?

33:33.928 --> 33:35.262
- Is that the tail?
- No.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.181
Oh. I'd better go over to this side.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.227
You get the head.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.438
- The head?
- Yeah.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.690
You try the tail.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.153
Okay, now you try the head.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.032
Grab him!

33:56.367 --> 33:57.826
He's dead.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.120
Still talking.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.999
He's dead.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.334
He's dead?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.469
Move forward.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.228
Come on.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.813
Come on, come on. Hands up.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.608
Next. Next.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.652
Two. Three. Four.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.989
- Next.
- Bring it around here.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.116
Just lay the croc right there.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.119
- Just drop it. All right, search them.
- Hold it.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.496
- Move out.
- Move.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.791
He's pretty big.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.667
This skin's worth some money.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.636
Move it!

34:57.804 --> 34:59.846
What the hell are you looking at?

35:21.202 --> 35:22.410
You're Louis Dega.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.748
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Clusiot.

35:26.916 --> 35:30.252
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

35:31.045 --> 35:32.879
Favoritism.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.637
Friend's kind of quiet, isn't he?

35:40.847 --> 35:42.722
He's dead.

35:43.224 --> 35:47.644
He jammed a piece of wood down
his throat and choked himself to death.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.773
Three-way split.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.400
Fair, isn't it?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.003
Quinine.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.631
Worst country in the world for malaria.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.892
Here, take them.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.062
Go ahead. I've got some left.

36:32.106 --> 36:35.317
Well, if I'm gonna get my sleep...

36:35.526 --> 36:38.904
...I'll have to take this poor bastard
with me.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.619
- Decent man.
- Mm.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.831
Dega.

36:51.125 --> 36:54.044
The man hunters.
The ones we saw down at the dock.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.379
Son of a bitches.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.679
- Butterflies?
- Yeah, that's right.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.640
Some guy named Richter.

37:06.807 --> 37:10.644
He works every camp on the river,
buying the damn things.

37:10.978 --> 37:15.106
We catch them, he buys them,
the guards get the big payoff.

37:15.274 --> 37:17.776
It's called the Blue Morphus butterfly.

37:17.944 --> 37:21.863
Its wings are used, uh, for dye
in making American currency.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.575
How often does he come up here?

37:25.743 --> 37:27.953
- A couple times a month.
- Boat?

37:28.120 --> 37:30.247
No other way.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.874
- Why?
- Thinking.

37:33.209 --> 37:36.503
I handle a boat pretty good myself,
you know.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.671
Yeah?

38:05.032 --> 38:08.451
You're supposed to catch them,
you clumsy bastard.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.481
- Where do you send these bugs, sir?
- United States.

39:24.945 --> 39:27.947
How much you charge
to send this one as far as Panama?

39:31.702 --> 39:32.911
Guard, come here a minute.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.790
Don't turn me in, for chrissake.
I got 1000 for you.

39:36.957 --> 39:41.127
- I didn't hear you.
- I said I got 2000, on me, right now.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.296
What's the trouble?

39:47.343 --> 39:51.346
This man just brought me
the finest Morphus I've ever seen.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.892
- Why don't you get him a net?
- Right away, sir.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.103
I want a seaworthy boat, new sail.

39:58.270 --> 40:02.816
Cost you 4000, my friend.
Half now, half on delivery.

40:02.983 --> 40:05.402
- When will that be?
- One week from tonight.

40:05.569 --> 40:08.988
- Where will the boat be?
- Half a mile downriver.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.366
About 300 yards this side of the river...

40:11.534 --> 40:13.993
...there's a big tree.
You can't miss it.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.329
I'll be there.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.873
You bring me the rest of the money.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.252
I'll take you to your boat.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.384
You're a goddamn burglar...

40:29.677 --> 40:31.511
...and that proves it.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.617
Are you asleep?

40:56.287 --> 40:57.954
No.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.207
I've been thinking. ...

41:02.710 --> 41:05.295
When you decide to go...

41:06.714 --> 41:10.049
...I'd very much appreciate
going with you.

41:14.054 --> 41:15.054
What?

41:20.102 --> 41:22.562
- Can you handle a boat?
- No.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.982
Well, can you even see a boat
without your glasses?

41:27.109 --> 41:28.151
I can help.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.154
Jesus Christ. You were the one
that didn't wanna escape.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.406
I didn't.

41:33.699 --> 41:36.075
Now I have no choice.

41:36.535 --> 41:40.955
If I stay here in this place...

41:43.584 --> 41:45.418
...I'll die.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.132
Well, it's your money.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.276
You two, got a job for you.

42:10.444 --> 42:14.280
You load a stiff into the boat.
You load him right now.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.503
Julot.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.135
Pick him up.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.772
Dega!

42:48.566 --> 42:50.650
Don't puke here!

42:50.818 --> 42:52.485
Hey, sarge!

42:52.945 --> 42:54.946
Sarge!

42:55.114 --> 42:57.073
He didn't mean it, sir. He's sick.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.325
I'll take care of him.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.538
Stop that, you pig!

43:17.511 --> 43:19.721
He didn't-- He didn't mean it.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.347
I'll take care of him, sir.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.650
Stop, you bastard!

43:57.384 --> 44:02.722
Do you realize that the first man
who carved a wheel out of stone...

44:02.890 --> 44:05.558
...used it as an ornament?

44:07.561 --> 44:10.146
I've always admired him for that.

44:14.234 --> 44:16.361
There's one search party that gave up.

44:23.369 --> 44:26.704
Instead of trying to make
the orifice fit the lens...

44:26.872 --> 44:29.582
...I made the lens fit the orifice.

44:35.756 --> 44:38.758
What do you think?
Did he make it or didn't he?

44:41.679 --> 44:44.764
Oh, I'd say his chances are very poor,
wouldn't you?

44:44.932 --> 44:49.394
Jesus. Is that all you've got to say?

44:50.479 --> 44:53.022
What do you expect me to say?

44:53.440 --> 44:57.318
That man risked his life to save mine.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.781
For me, that's a new experience.

45:08.288 --> 45:11.207
These may work better than I had hoped.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.061
I told you you couldn't miss it.

45:36.316 --> 45:41.320
The only trouble is,
you're a week early.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.574
It's up to you.

45:44.742 --> 45:48.411
You're worth just as much dead
as you are alive.

46:28.285 --> 46:31.370
The rule here is total silence.

46:31.538 --> 46:33.498
We make no pretense
of rehabilitation here.

46:33.665 --> 46:36.501
We're not priests, we're processors.

46:37.377 --> 46:40.379
A meatpacker processes live animals
into edible ones.

46:40.547 --> 46:43.341
We process dangerous men
into harmless ones.

46:44.510 --> 46:47.303
This we accomplish by breaking you.

46:47.471 --> 46:52.141
Breaking you physically, spiritually,
and here.

46:52.309 --> 46:57.146
Strange things happen to the head here.
Put all hope out of your mind...

46:57.898 --> 47:01.526
...and masturbate as little as possible.
It drains the strength.

47:01.693 --> 47:04.028
That's all. Take him away.

49:16.828 --> 49:29.256
One, two, three, four, five.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.552
Oh, Jesus.

50:58.764 --> 51:03.809
No. You'll eat everything they give you.

51:13.487 --> 51:21.660
I'm gonna be fine.

51:21.953 --> 51:26.207
One, two, three, four, five.

52:03.703 --> 52:05.871
I'm Jo-Jo.

52:06.289 --> 52:07.331
Papillon.

52:09.376 --> 52:10.876
How do I look?

52:11.044 --> 52:13.712
I feel pretty good...

52:13.880 --> 52:17.633
...but I need somebody
to tell me how I look.

52:19.094 --> 52:21.971
Fine. You look fine.

53:14.858 --> 53:17.985
"Chew the coconut well...

53:20.614 --> 53:22.072
...then swallow the pulp.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.367
One each day, for strength.

53:25.535 --> 53:28.162
My thoughts are with you.

53:28.622 --> 53:29.788
Squinter."

53:29.956 --> 53:35.419
Dega. I'll be a son of a bitch. Dega.

53:42.510 --> 53:44.011
Mm.

54:27.180 --> 54:29.974
I'm still here, you bastards.

55:41.421 --> 55:44.465
Prisoner, show yourself.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.939
You've been receiving coconuts.

56:01.107 --> 56:04.651
Unless you tell us who sent them,
your rations will be cut in half.

56:04.819 --> 56:08.280
Well, how can I tell you...

56:08.448 --> 56:11.700
- ...who sent me stuff I didn't get?
- What stuff?

56:13.286 --> 56:16.830
Well, I-- I don't know.

56:16.998 --> 56:18.415
You...

56:18.583 --> 56:20.459
You said coconut.

56:20.835 --> 56:23.087
I want that name, and I want it now.

56:27.884 --> 56:30.969
Put him on half rations
and screen his cell for six months.

56:33.264 --> 56:36.558
Darkness does wonders
for a bad memory.

57:27.193 --> 57:29.319
You know the charge.

57:29.946 --> 57:31.697
I'm innocent.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.866
I didn't kill that pimp.

57:34.033 --> 57:37.536
You couldn't get anything on me,
and you framed me.

57:38.371 --> 57:41.206
That is quite true.

57:41.458 --> 57:46.336
But your real crime has nothing to do
with a pimp's death.

57:48.089 --> 57:50.507
Well, then, what is it?

57:50.675 --> 57:56.555
Yours is the most terrible crime
a human being can commit.

57:56.723 --> 57:59.141
I accuse you...

57:59.309 --> 58:01.810
...of a wasted life.

58:04.981 --> 58:06.023
Guilty.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.152
The penalty for that is death.

58:12.155 --> 58:23.999
Guilty.

59:18.805 --> 59:19.930
They know.

59:26.896 --> 59:28.230
- Hey.
- Hey.

59:28.398 --> 59:29.606
Hey.

59:29.774 --> 59:31.650
That's right, Cliff.

59:33.611 --> 59:35.821
Switch it to diamonds.

59:44.872 --> 59:46.623
How did you hear?

59:46.791 --> 59:50.836
Trustee. Works on the launch
between here and Saint Joseph.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.297
That's all that he said?

59:55.258 --> 59:57.759
Then it's only a matter of time.

59:57.927 --> 59:58.969
You think so?

59:59.137 --> 01:00:02.347
He's on half rations now.
He can't exist on that.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:06.351
Forced to choose between starvation
and telling, what would you do?

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.522
We're not talking about me.
What would you do?

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:14.359
I'd tell. I'd have to.

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:18.822
You get weak, you get delirious,
you lose control...

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.783
...and you talk.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.245
Then you won't blame him, huh?

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.378
Blame is for God and small children.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.512
I eat bugs.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.600
I don't... I don't have enough sense
to get out of the rain. Ha, ha.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.330
Prisoner, show yourself.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:56.354
Give me the name,
and you're back on full rations.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.357
Just one name.

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:04.946
I don't-- I don't get that hungry.

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:09.785
You'll starve. You should see yourself.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.622
I was born skinny.

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.043
Then you'll die.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:07.592
One, two...

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.613
I'm Papillon.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.782
Francisco.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.868
How do I look?

01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:35.120
Do I look okay?

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.454
You look swell.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:23.501
That's 30 days more, pimp killer.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:25.712
I wanna see the warden.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.798
I wanna talk to him.
I have something I wanna tell him.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.799
Who gave you the food?

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.393
I...

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:26.231
Jesus, warden...

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:29.484
...I had it.

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:34.239
I had the name, honest to God. I...

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:37.742
I must be light--

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:43.456
I must be lightheaded or something,
because I...

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:48.837
I'm trying.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:52.549
I... I can't remember.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:56.928
Honest to God, I can't. I can't.
I can't remember.

01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:02.642
It's not there, Mr. Prosecutor.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.603
I know. It's not-- It's not there.

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:07.439
No.

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:20.952
He's dying.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:26.411
You're dead.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:00.320
Your term is completed.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:47.825
One, two, three, four...

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:50.370
...five...

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.377
...six.

01:10:58.003 --> 01:11:00.463
Oh, you son of a bitch.

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.979
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

01:11:16.146 --> 01:11:18.690
...of French Guiana...

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.109
...whose prisoners you are...

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:24.612
...and from which there is no escape.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.867
First attempts at escape...

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:34.706
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:40.336
Second attempts add five more.

01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:44.173
Of course, more serious offenses...

01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:47.677
...are dealt with in this fashion.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.985
Hello, Papi.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:11.075
Don't take advantage. I'm in handcuffs.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:14.162
Make the best of what we offer you...

01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:17.957
...and you will suffer less
than you deserve.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.917
Dismissed.

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:26.549
Into the bunkhouse! One, two...

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.784
I have hot soup, with real meat in it.

01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:55.453
Dega sent it to you.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:12.720
My name is Maturette.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:30.840
How are you?

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:33.384
Pretty good.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:39.223
You'd be in much better health,
you know, if you'd given them my name.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.476
Almost did.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.564
Someone once said
that temptation resisted...

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:50.193
...is the true measure of character.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.197
How'd you get out of Kilo 40?

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:57.575
It was the rankest sort of corruption.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:01.412
Suffice it to say the warden
now has a new house...

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.706
...and I've become his chief clerk.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:07.877
Papi, look, my wife and lawyer...

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:11.172
...have convinced certain members
in the Ministry of Justice...

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.424
...that my sentence was a bit harsh.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:18.513
Some months back,
I asked them to look into your case...

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.973
...and they've made some headway.

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:23.809
One of the principal witnesses
against you...

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:27.271
...may be willing to change his story...

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:28.439
...for a price.

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:31.567
If this happened, when would it be?

01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:33.611
You could be out in perhaps three years.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.322
- Too long.
- No, it isn't.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.617
And with a good job,
the time will pass very quickly.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.787
Listen, my friend...

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.789
...you owe me nothing.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.256
Tell me what you want.

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:55.675
A boat.

01:16:02.307 --> 01:16:04.475
I should have known.

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.781
- Papi, don't you remember me?
- Yeah.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:27.493
- Clusiot.
- Yeah.

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.037
What happened to your eyes?

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:37.545
I put some ground-up castor beans in them
so I'd look sick enough to get in here.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.213
Why?

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.006
I'm going with you.

01:18:41.174 --> 01:18:44.802
- What?
- Yeah. Listen.

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:48.013
Dega's got you on the x-ray list
for tomorrow.

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:51.642
The x-ray doctor, he's a convict.
Some kind of Hindu or something.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:55.146
He's got somebody on the outside
who can sell you a boat...

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:57.815
...if the price is right.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:02.319
When do we run, Papi?

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:09.785
Soon. I'll talk to that doctor tomorrow.

01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:22.923
The last boat I obtained
was for a sex murderer.

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:26.927
They shot him to pieces
six miles down the river, poor man. Ha.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.555
But the boat stood up very well.

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:32.641
- You have the heart of an ox.
- What kind of a boat?

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:38.773
Fourteen feet, complete with compass,
sails, tools, clothes.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:43.152
Ah, the generator begins.
Science takes over. Ha, ha.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.405
You know, x-rays are quite worthless.
They always have been.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:49.116
Lie down, please, on the back.

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:50.826
How much would it cost?

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:54.038
Three thousand in advance,
which you pay to me...

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:57.166
...and I pay to Pascal,
who provides everything.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:00.836
Draw a deep breath, please,
and hold completely still.

01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:05.341
Another 3000 you must pay directly
to Pascal when he delivers the boat.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:08.427
Exhale, please, and turn over.

01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:12.765
If I decide to make a deal,
how do we handle it?

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:16.393
Have no fear. Ways will be found.

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:20.231
Trust me for everything.

01:20:20.398 --> 01:20:23.651
Last time I did that
cost me two years in solitary.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.654
Aha. So you have been cheated, eh?

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.907
Ha, ha. Well, happily for you,
money doesn't tempt me.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:33.577
I'm after bigger game.
Draw a deep breath.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.038
You see...

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:38.332
...I killed my whole family.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.003
All of them.
My wife and four little ones.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:46.298
Exhale, if you haven't already.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.303
You double-cross me, I'll kill you.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.973
Of course.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.851
I would consider that a favor.

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.228
A very great favor.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.501
One of these nights I might ask you
to take that turnkey into the toilet.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:26.297
Show him a good time.
When you come out, you'll get 1000.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:29.592
Why?

01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:34.221
That's my business. Your business is
to make him happy for 10 minutes.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.348
One thousand.

01:21:36.516 --> 01:21:38.100
He's filthy.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.936
All right, 2000.
Does that make him any cleaner?

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.986
- You think I'm a whore, don't you?
- Easy.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.280
Well, you're wrong.

01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:53.657
Next.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:19.201
I'll do what you ask, on one condition:

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:22.746
You keep your money,
and you take me with you.

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:23.956
No.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:26.583
I'm the only one
who can get you out of here.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:35.843
- You're a f--
- I know.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:41.306
I'm a queer. I'm a fairy. I'm a poof.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.102
But there's one thing you forgot.

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:48.313
You may have been framed,
as you say you were...

01:23:48.481 --> 01:23:49.940
...but I wasn't.

01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:52.526
Between the two of us...

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:56.321
...I'm the one who's killed a man,
not you.

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:02.828
Okay.

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:49.666
It's tonight during the concert.

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:53.670
I'll be there. I have to.
I'm, uh, serving refreshments.

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:56.632
I think you ought to go with us.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.635
- You ought to.
- Thank you.

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:03.764
But my wife is arranging for my release.
The letter from her is overdue.

01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:08.852
Listen to me.

01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:13.607
If your wife was here and you were
in Paris with all of that money...

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.360
...how much would you pay
to get her back?

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.070
Everything I have.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.992
And how much would she pay
to get you back?

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:30.958
That's why you should run.

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:34.044
Now, Louis, while you've got a chance.

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:36.713
But I have a chance without running.

01:25:39.884 --> 01:25:42.219
Me, they can kill.

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:44.054
You, they own.

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:50.811
Goodbye.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.855
Good luck.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:20.807
Clusiot.

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:25.187
Halt!

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:38.575
Dega, you bastard.

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:40.452
- Guard!
- Shit.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:48.376
Guard!

01:31:50.546 --> 01:31:56.760
Pull.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:03.350
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

01:32:16.447 --> 01:32:17.739
Let's go.

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:20.075
- Where's Clusiot?
- Guard got him.

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:21.910
Let's go.

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:38.093
Here. Here.

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:40.470
- Where's the other one?
- Right here. Right here.

01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:42.472
Just a little twist.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.474
Come on, come on.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.686
There's your boat over there.

01:33:31.522 --> 01:33:33.398
Three thousand.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:42.866
Check her out, see if everything's okay.
Come on, come on. I'm in a hurry.

01:33:43.367 --> 01:33:45.493
Let's go. Let's go.

01:33:47.246 --> 01:33:50.915
I wouldn't use those guns if you don't
want the man hunters down on you.

01:33:52.543 --> 01:33:55.378
I put two gallons of rum aboard.

01:33:55.546 --> 01:33:58.048
Send me a postcard
when you get to Honduras.

01:34:16.233 --> 01:34:18.485
Let's have a drink of that rum.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:27.160
What the...?

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.455
Well, this...

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.999
...goddamn boat's no good.

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:35.502
Look at it. I'll kill that bastard.

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:38.922
- Son of a bitch is made out of kindling.
- So is my leg.

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.718
I didn't twist my ankle, I fractured it.

01:34:43.886 --> 01:34:47.055
You broke your leg?
Well, why didn't you say something?

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:49.766
I had the unworthy suspicion
you might leave me behind.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:52.477
- You're goddamn right.
- It's broken, all right.

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:54.771
We've got to set this. I need your help.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:57.607
- I presume it'll be somewhat painful?
- You bet it will.

01:34:57.983 --> 01:35:00.944
I ask you to remember that
that's my money that's sinking.

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:03.363
I'm here out of an act
of unnatural heroism...

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.615
...which prevented a guard
from shooting you.

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:08.201
He probably would've
missed me anyway.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.703
- Now relax.
- What?

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:12.747
- Relax.
- You're at the wrong end.

01:35:16.627 --> 01:35:19.045
It'll only last a couple of minutes.

01:35:23.634 --> 01:35:26.302
- Jesus.
- Hold him above the knee.

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:28.346
Ready?

01:35:35.855 --> 01:35:37.439
That finishes it.

01:35:37.606 --> 01:35:39.399
How'd you do that?

01:35:40.025 --> 01:35:43.403
- We've all got our sensitive spots.
- What happened?

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:46.322
He found a sensitive spot
you didn't know you had.

01:36:05.509 --> 01:36:07.677
Move, and you're dead.

01:36:08.554 --> 01:36:10.513
Turn around.

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.850
Throw that gun out in front of you.

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:20.523
You know, I get 200 for one of these.
I wouldn't wanna lose it.

01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:22.525
Turn around.

01:36:25.362 --> 01:36:28.531
You and two others broke out
of Saint-Laurent last night, didn't you?

01:36:28.699 --> 01:36:30.992
- That's right.
- And the others are at the boat?

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:33.953
- That's right.
- And the boat's no good.

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:35.622
Not worth a damn.

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.374
Been expecting you.

01:36:45.716 --> 01:36:47.509
Come on.

01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:57.143
Don't shoot. It's okay.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:04.526
Caught these two man
hunters asleep just before sunup.

01:37:04.693 --> 01:37:07.695
They've been hanging around
for two days waiting on you.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:12.325
You know, each time he sells that boat,
it's in worse shape than the last time.

01:37:15.746 --> 01:37:16.996
You like this?

01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:19.666
Oh, very much.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:22.585
I did too, at the time, but I was drunk.
Ha, ha.

01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.630
Here, take this.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.799
Cut yourself some bamboo
from around here.

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:31.928
Lash it together with sailcloth.
I'll be back around sunset.

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:37.892
I'll tow you upriver to Pigeon Island.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.979
You can get a boat there
if you got enough money.

01:37:41.772 --> 01:37:44.774
If you haven't got enough money,
they'll probably kill you.

01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:48.611
Doesn't matter much to them either way.
They're all lepers.

01:38:34.366 --> 01:38:37.035
You noisy son of a bitch.

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:40.496
Do dogs carry leprosy?

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:53.927
Well...

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.428
...the hell with it.

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.555
- You better take the--
- Shh.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:02.018
I don't wanna fight these people.

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:05.188
Just wanna try and talk them
out of a boat.

01:39:52.903 --> 01:39:55.071
Who are you?

01:39:57.741 --> 01:40:00.326
Escaped prisoner, Papillon.

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.245
Where are the other two?

01:40:02.413 --> 01:40:04.497
They're down on the beach.

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:07.166
One's got a broken ankle.

01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:09.502
Come in.

01:40:52.963 --> 01:40:54.380
You have two rifles.

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:58.092
- That's right.
- And you want a boat.

01:40:59.136 --> 01:41:02.430
- That's right.
- But you're short of money.

01:41:04.099 --> 01:41:06.225
That's right too.

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:11.230
Why don't you have the courtesy
to look at me when you speak?

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:28.372
We do a lot of smuggling here.
We raid the mainland. We steal boats.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.333
When an outsider comes in...

01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:33.836
...we generally kill him,
as a security measure.

01:41:35.297 --> 01:41:37.507
That makes sense.

01:41:37.674 --> 01:41:39.342
Well...

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:42.678
...a man of Christian understanding.

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:46.349
Do you like cigars?

01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:49.060
When I can get them.

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:53.648
Try this one.

01:42:23.762 --> 01:42:28.599
How did you know I have dry leprosy,
that it isn't contagious?

01:42:30.602 --> 01:42:32.395
I didn't.

01:42:58.172 --> 01:43:01.257
Normal weather, you should sight
Honduras in three and a half...

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.676
...maybe four weeks.

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:08.556
When you get there, you'll need
some money. We passed the hat.

01:43:09.099 --> 01:43:12.518
Take it. It's disinfected.

01:43:14.104 --> 01:43:18.941
If you're gonna catch leprosy, it's better
to catch it from money than from people.

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:24.947
Take it.

01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:30.578
All we use it for is gambling...

01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:34.540
...bringing in women lepers from Albina.

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:37.293
We've always got enough for that.

01:43:43.634 --> 01:43:47.970
Hurry up. Get onboard.
You'll miss the tide.

01:44:00.984 --> 01:44:02.818
Goodbye.

01:44:39.314 --> 01:44:40.356
Honduras.

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:07.758
My leg! Get it off my leg!

01:45:07.926 --> 01:45:09.343
It's on my leg!

01:45:09.511 --> 01:45:11.220
Goddamn it!

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:14.367
All right, come on. Come on, one more.

01:46:14.534 --> 01:46:18.079
- I'm already so drunk I can't think.
- Yeah.

01:46:18.246 --> 01:46:20.247
That's what I want.

01:46:24.002 --> 01:46:26.754
I want you to put this
between your teeth.

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:31.050
It's gonna hurt you, Louis.

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:36.722
If you wanna yell, you yell.

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.225
I certainly will.

01:47:08.839 --> 01:47:11.507
- I fooled you.
- What?

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.011
I fooled you, didn't I?

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:58.614
Goddamn it, we... We made it.

01:49:41.825 --> 01:49:43.117
Huh?

02:04:11.527 --> 02:04:13.153
Huh?

02:05:18.427 --> 02:05:19.552
What was your crime?

02:05:22.097 --> 02:05:23.890
Murder.

02:05:24.225 --> 02:05:26.893
But I wasn't guilty.
I've never killed anybody in my life.

02:05:28.521 --> 02:05:31.731
If you did regain your freedom,
what would you do with it?

02:05:33.776 --> 02:05:35.944
I haven't had much time
to think about that.

02:05:36.111 --> 02:05:39.906
If you are a thief or a murderer,
by morning...

02:05:40.074 --> 02:05:42.784
...you might have stolen
everything we have.

02:05:48.082 --> 02:05:51.251
These are mine. They were a gift.

02:05:52.127 --> 02:05:54.796
You keep them until I leave.

02:06:13.190 --> 02:06:14.816
Are you awake?

02:06:14.984 --> 02:06:16.693
Yes, ma'am.

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:37.213
If you are sinful, you have made amends
by feeding half the poor in Santa Marta.

02:06:37.715 --> 02:06:40.925
If you are truly not sinful,
you have nothing to fear.

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:43.303
God will watch over you.

02:07:58.921 --> 02:08:02.256
Your five years in solitary confinement
are at an end.

02:08:03.425 --> 02:08:05.927
You've paid part of your debt to France.

02:08:57.604 --> 02:08:58.813
Papi.

02:09:09.825 --> 02:09:11.909
We're free.

02:10:51.301 --> 02:10:54.512
That's the only way off Devil's Island.

02:10:57.558 --> 02:11:00.560
We try to take things easy here.

02:11:01.478 --> 02:11:03.771
The sharks and the tide
do the real guard work...

02:11:03.939 --> 02:11:06.774
...so it's live and let live...

02:11:06.942 --> 02:11:09.819
...unless you make trouble.

02:11:13.115 --> 02:11:15.408
That one's empty.
You might as well take it.

02:11:15.576 --> 02:11:17.451
But watch yourself
around the other huts.

02:11:17.619 --> 02:11:20.288
Somebody might take you for a poacher
and kill you.

02:12:02.497 --> 02:12:04.957
How dare you sit there?

02:12:05.125 --> 02:12:08.002
This bench belongs to Captain Dreyfus.

02:12:08.170 --> 02:12:10.588
Who are you to sit on that bench?

02:12:11.965 --> 02:12:13.007
Nobody.

02:12:13.467 --> 02:12:16.594
That's right. Ha, ha. Nobody.

02:12:17.179 --> 02:12:19.847
Do you know who I am?

02:12:45.165 --> 02:12:55.049
Dega?

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:01.555
Dega.

02:13:12.025 --> 02:13:13.693
Dega?

02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:40.469
Louis.

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:47.727
I wish you hadn't come here.

02:13:58.363 --> 02:14:00.281
Are you fond of crayfish?

02:14:31.938 --> 02:14:33.355
Good.

02:14:34.941 --> 02:14:36.692
You really think so?

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.529
It's the best I've had in years.

02:14:46.328 --> 02:14:47.828
Did you hear about my wife?

02:14:49.539 --> 02:14:53.667
She married my attorney,
or else he married her...

02:14:53.835 --> 02:14:57.171
...although, actually,
it doesn't really matter.

02:14:57.339 --> 02:15:01.509
I mean, it all works out
to the same thing, don't you think?

02:15:07.724 --> 02:15:12.436
Well, I have not heard from her
in about...

02:15:13.855 --> 02:15:16.524
It is nice here, isn't it?

02:15:17.275 --> 02:15:20.152
You've made it nice, Louis.

02:15:21.196 --> 02:15:23.114
Really nice.

02:15:26.034 --> 02:15:28.202
Funny...

02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:31.705
...you and me ending up here.

02:15:32.916 --> 02:15:35.626
We're the only ones left.

02:15:38.463 --> 02:15:41.382
- Do you ever wonder about it?
- No.

02:15:43.218 --> 02:15:44.885
I do.

02:15:47.848 --> 02:15:49.723
Get away!

02:15:51.601 --> 02:15:54.562
Get away! Get away!

02:15:55.063 --> 02:15:56.897
That's enough!

02:16:08.743 --> 02:16:10.911
They come and steal from my garden.

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.580
Who does?

02:16:18.253 --> 02:16:21.589
- Maybe I better go.
- Yes.

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:28.971
I know your house.
There's no ghost in it.

02:17:04.090 --> 02:17:06.467
My thoughts are with you.

02:17:34.955 --> 02:17:36.789
Jesus.

02:18:06.945 --> 02:18:09.446
Louis. Louis.

02:18:09.614 --> 02:18:13.075
Come look. Remember those seeds
that Sergeant Santini gave me last month?

02:18:13.243 --> 02:18:15.326
- They've come up. We'll have carrots.
- Louis.

02:18:15.495 --> 02:18:18.289
It said six weeks on the packet,
but it's only taken four.

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:20.820
Louis If I could find
a way to get off this island,

02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:22.183
would you like to come with me?

02:18:22.252 --> 02:18:23.544
Oh, yes, of course.

02:18:23.712 --> 02:18:27.172
Get away. Freddie, you know better
than that. Get away.

02:18:28.717 --> 02:18:31.885
- I got no money. They took it all.
- Forget about that.

02:18:32.053 --> 02:18:34.430
- You can't buy your way out of here.
- Then how?

02:18:36.391 --> 02:18:37.433
I don't know yet.

02:18:37.892 --> 02:18:41.395
Then we don't have to discuss it.
Tell me, do you like tomatoes?

02:18:41.563 --> 02:18:45.691
I have some extra seeds.
You might like to start your own garden.

02:19:10.174 --> 02:19:13.427
You see? It's a horseshoe.

02:19:13.594 --> 02:19:16.472
When the waves break,
they have no place else to go...

02:19:16.638 --> 02:19:18.474
...except go back out again.

02:19:18.641 --> 02:19:21.852
Well, you can't launch a boat from here.

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:22.740
In fact...

02:19:22.745 --> 02:19:25.873
there's no place on the entire island
where you can launch a boat.

02:19:25.982 --> 02:19:29.777
Bags of coconuts tied together,
just throw them over...

02:19:30.445 --> 02:19:32.612
...float out on a wave.

02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:35.991
Then what happens?

02:19:36.325 --> 02:19:41.120
The mainland's only 24 miles.
You just drift with the current.

02:19:43.290 --> 02:19:45.125
Only two days.

02:19:45.293 --> 02:19:47.127
- You're certain?
- Yeah.

02:19:49.297 --> 02:19:52.841
Seems so..... Ha, ha, so desperate.

02:19:53.676 --> 02:19:54.927
Yeah.

02:19:56.346 --> 02:19:58.639
You think it will work?

02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:01.433
Does it matter?

02:20:07.524 --> 02:20:10.484
Get. Get. Now, that's not yours.

02:20:10.652 --> 02:20:11.693
Now, you get away.

02:20:11.861 --> 02:20:15.030
I'm not going to tell you again.
Here you are, Freddie.

02:20:15.198 --> 02:20:17.199
Freddie's not feeling well today...

02:20:17.367 --> 02:20:19.660
...and you should appreciate that fact.

02:20:20.286 --> 02:20:21.829
Here we are.

02:20:24.416 --> 02:20:26.792
Okay, little one. All right.

02:20:29.170 --> 02:20:30.712
Freddie.

02:20:31.423 --> 02:20:34.174
Freddie, that's not for you.
That's Adam's.

02:20:34.342 --> 02:20:36.176
Come here, Adam.

02:20:37.637 --> 02:20:40.431
- Let's take a walk.
- Certainly.

02:20:40.598 --> 02:20:43.016
Isn't that a little small?

02:20:43.518 --> 02:20:46.937
- It's just to try it with.
- Certainly.

02:20:47.981 --> 02:20:52.025
You know, I've been thinking
of building a porch.

02:20:52.193 --> 02:20:55.904
There's not a home on the entire island
with a porch.

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:59.158
Not even Sergeant Santini has a porch.

02:20:59.325 --> 02:21:02.995
- What do you think, huh?
- Come on.

02:23:29.517 --> 02:23:31.268
It was the wrong wave.

02:23:32.979 --> 02:23:35.314
Oh, yeah.

02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:38.233
They come in a series of seven.

02:23:38.401 --> 02:23:40.694
And the seventh wave is big enough...

02:23:40.862 --> 02:23:43.530
...to take us both out
beyond the point of return.

02:23:46.117 --> 02:23:48.577
- Are you certain?
- Yeah.

02:23:49.746 --> 02:23:51.371
Excellent.

02:23:56.002 --> 02:23:59.296
Oh, if we're going,
I better pick those carrots.

02:24:14.354 --> 02:24:16.396
Fourth wave.

02:24:25.615 --> 02:24:26.907
Ready?

02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:29.826
I must tell you something.

02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:33.622
Louis, you don't have to say anything.

02:24:34.624 --> 02:24:36.625
I meant to.

02:24:37.752 --> 02:24:38.794
I'm sorry.

02:24:40.922 --> 02:24:42.047
I know.

02:24:46.594 --> 02:24:48.261
You'll be killed.

02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:49.846
You know that?

02:24:50.932 --> 02:24:51.932
Maybe.

02:24:53.226 --> 02:24:54.976
Please don't do it.

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:43.270
Hey, you bastards, I'm still here.

02:27:54.991 --> 02:27:57.868
<i>Papillon made it to freedom...</i>

02:27:58.286 --> 02:28:03.456
<i>...and for the remaining years
of his life, he lived a free man.</i>

02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:08.628
<i>This, the infamous penal system
in French Guiana...</i>

02:28:08.796 --> 02:28:11.089
<i>...did not survive him.</i>
