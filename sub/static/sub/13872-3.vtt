00:55.021 --> 00:58.354
- Meatwad, are you in here?
- I'm in here.

00:58.425 --> 01:02.361
- You're gonna spoil your dinner, boy.
- Dinner? This is my dinner.

01:02.462 --> 01:05.022
- A jumbo bag of Enchiladitos?
- Yep.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.396
<i>Enchiladitos
they make you want to eat 'em</i>

01:07.467 --> 01:11.028
I'll have you know that I've been in there
cooking a three-bean casserole...

01:11.104 --> 01:13.629
Quick question here.
Is it Zesty Ranch flavor?

01:13.706 --> 01:15.071
No, it's bean-flavored.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.939
Yuck City.
Have fun eating it, 'cause I'm eating this.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.740
You're gonna stunt your growth...

01:19.813 --> 01:21.781
Quiet now. I need complete, total silence.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.045
Otherwise, I'm not gonna
be able to execute this here...

01:26.419 --> 01:28.284
cheese procedure.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.288
What is that stink in the kitchen?

01:30.356 --> 01:33.689
Because if that... Enchiladitos!
Where did you... How did...

01:33.760 --> 01:36.558
- I got them at the store.
- You're not allowed out there.

01:36.629 --> 01:40.156
- Precious Ranch dust!
- That's my dust there. You give it back.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.962
What are these, temporary tattoos?

01:42.035 --> 01:44.026
- Get them out of here!
- Don't throw them away.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.470
- I gotta lick that dust off of them.
- My goodness!

01:46.539 --> 01:49.303
Meatwad, you've just won
two tickets to the Super Bowl.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.070
Yeah, I believe you.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.975
- Yeah, right.
- You're bluffing.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.139
He is. Look at him. He's sweating.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.843
Congratulations, consumer.
You're going to the Super Bowl.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.908
Give me those! They're mine! I won them!

01:59.986 --> 02:01.419
I bought the bag.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.514
- I get the bag and everything inside it.
- And you have the bag.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.821
You're a deep sea diver.
Go drink some salt water.

02:06.893 --> 02:09.794
Shake, Meatwad bought the chips.
The tickets are his.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.661
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

02:12.732 --> 02:17.533
No one escapes the... From the...

02:18.771 --> 02:21.706
- Alcatraz.
- Congratulations, Meatwad.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.140
You and a friend
are going to the Super Bowl.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.976
Don't that kick a little ass?
Wait. I ain't got no friends.

02:28.047 --> 02:31.073
I'm your friend.
I'm going to the Super Bowl with you.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.051
We better hide them tickets.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.653
God, this is so gross.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.059
What? Good morning.

02:44.397 --> 02:47.059
- What are you doing?
- I didn't leave my keys in here.

02:47.133 --> 02:50.728
I'm such a silly...
This must be the wrong place.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.667
Good morning.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.741
Good morning.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.901
Good...

02:58.978 --> 03:01.913
- Stay down, fool!
- You looking for something?

03:02.448 --> 03:05.383
- Yeah, are you looking for something?
- Just everlasting peace.

03:05.451 --> 03:08.011
Look, I shrunk the tickets down
and injected them...

03:08.087 --> 03:09.577
into my bloodstream.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.891
I said to hide them,
not get them all bloody.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.723
You know, you didn't have to do that.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.696
I'm not an animal. I don't eat my own crap.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.494
I mean, I have standards.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.426
Shut up. Damn.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.941
Can I help you?

03:30.009 --> 03:32.409
You're not Mr. Jones, Room 302.

03:32.478 --> 03:36.107
Where are my charts?
No charts? Somebody's fired.

03:36.182 --> 03:39.379
I gotta fire someone.
I'm just gonna shut the door behind me.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.511
You go back to bed, you trooper.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.817
Carl, how you doing?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.716
Just the man I want to see there.

03:46.793 --> 03:50.593
I heard through the grapevine
that someone won a big prize recently.

03:50.663 --> 03:54.690
- Yep. I got two tickets to the Super Ball.
- No, it's "bowl".

03:54.767 --> 03:57.702
That's cute that you said that,
'cause you're a freaking idiot.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.933
I got a pigskin here. Let's wing it around.
Know what I'm saying?

04:01.007 --> 04:02.838
Pig... skin?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.969
Yes. They strip the skin off of little pigs...

04:06.045 --> 04:09.776
and then pour vinegar
all over their little pumping organs...

04:09.849 --> 04:11.680
all for a game.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.811
Get your meat ass out here
and have some fun with me.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.286
Get away from my buddy.
He's my good friend.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.485
But if you tell anyone I said that,
I will deny it up and down.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.960
Look, it's a super ball, like you said.

04:23.029 --> 04:27.022
It's what they use in the...
You know, where we're going.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.297
You're going. You.
You won the tickets, right?

04:30.370 --> 04:32.861
You... This is the one
that won the tickets, right?

04:33.573 --> 04:37.009
Okay, so you got the ball now.
You want to wrap your...

04:37.076 --> 04:40.307
You know, that stretchy little sticky thing.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.540
- Like this?
- No.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.946
- What about this?
- No, not like that either.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.042
- How about this?
- Sure, whatever.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.951
It's going right in the trash after this.
So, yeah, let her rip.

04:50.423 --> 04:53.517
Yeah, hooray! We won.
Who are you taking to the Super Bowl?

04:53.593 --> 04:58.189
- I guess I'll take my best friend.
- I mean, that's me, right?

04:58.264 --> 05:00.664
I mean, who just threw
the ball with you that...

05:00.733 --> 05:04.191
- you know, that one time I did.
- That's all nice and everything...

05:04.270 --> 05:07.398
but I'll tell you how
you can be a better friend.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.307
You can heat that pool up like a Jacuzzi.
It'd be real nice.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.504
Yeah, I could do that.

05:13.579 --> 05:17.037
But I could turn that hose on,
and you could, sort of, you know...

05:17.116 --> 05:20.847
- flip around in the sprinkler.
- Yeah, that'd be fun if I was stupid.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.514
- Heat the whole pool.
- I'll see what I can do there.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.457
Hi! Little buddy!

05:26.526 --> 05:30.622
How's my favorite little man doing?
Come here. Give me a... Stand by me.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.791
Tell you what,
my shoulders sure do ache...

05:33.866 --> 05:35.766
from throwing that ball so hard.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.736
You don't have shoulders.
You'd be lucky to have...

05:39.272 --> 05:41.797
I mean, let me rub them for you.

05:41.874 --> 05:46.072
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Why you got them oven mitts on?

05:46.145 --> 05:50.445
I ain't touching you skin-to-skin.
I mean, it's extra padding.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.677
You know? It's for your pleasure.

05:52.752 --> 05:56.654
I'm not entirely comfortable
with the level of asbestos in these mitts.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.884
Just take deep breaths. Breathe it in. Die!

05:58.958 --> 06:00.050
Give me those tickets!

06:00.126 --> 06:02.287
Why do you get to go?
You don't know what it is.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.990
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?

06:05.331 --> 06:07.856
How's your alignment feel now?
Is that straight?

06:07.934 --> 06:10.334
Yes, thank you. That does feel better.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.339
I'm such a butterfingers.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.598
Boy, I wonder...

06:15.675 --> 06:19.111
who should I get to go with me
to the Super Bowl, Frylock?

06:19.178 --> 06:22.079
It could be you,
if you know which buttons to push.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.673
I'm not that much of a sports fan, really.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.117
- Why? Is it a sporting event?
- Yeah.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.780
I mean, yes, it is a sporting event.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.051
It's the biggest football game of the year.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.422
Tell you what.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.520
You give me that there computer,
and maybe you'll get to go with me.

06:37.597 --> 06:41.727
- I really don't want to go.
- Super Bowl is in Detroit this year.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.903
- Oh, boy. Detroit.
- Yep.

06:45.938 --> 06:49.271
- The home of RoboCop.
- I don't want to go to the Super Bowl.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.140
Good, you won't get to,
'cause I'm taking my best friend...

06:52.211 --> 06:54.907
which is not you at the moment
because you yelled at me.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.471
Fine with me.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.312
Maybe I could shrink you
and put you into my bloodstream...

07:00.386 --> 07:01.478
Get the hell out of here!

07:02.789 --> 07:04.916
Look who just got a minibike.

07:04.991 --> 07:08.119
Look who just insulted me
with this 10-horsepower piece of crap.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.491
You think I'm a child?

07:09.562 --> 07:11.689
Don't look at the streamers.
Look at the frame.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.256
- This is a man's bike.
- Keep her cranked. Let me go get my dolly.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.937
How we doing, Carl?
Is that pool heated yet?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.701
Still kind of harping on that?

07:21.774 --> 07:24.868
You know, this little area right here
is pretty warm.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.107
Come on, hop in. Pee wherever.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.409
I know you do that.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.746
You're not doing the job I asked you to do.

07:31.818 --> 07:36.346
- I still see ice. That is a problem to me.
- Okay, time-out here.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.457
Something I need to say, you know.

07:38.524 --> 07:42.358
Ever since my son was never conceived...

07:42.428 --> 07:45.556
because I never had consensual sex
without money involved...

07:45.631 --> 07:48.930
I always sort of looked at you as...

07:49.635 --> 07:53.002
Well, kind of a thing that I could,
you know...

07:53.072 --> 07:56.269
live next to in accordance with state laws.

07:56.342 --> 08:00.438
That's so sweet.
You're trying to say that you love me.

08:00.513 --> 08:04.381
Whoa. Let's not put people
on the spot here.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.814
Who are you taking
to that freaking Super Bowl?

08:06.886 --> 08:07.978
Carl, your finger.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.686
Shake, what are you doing?

08:11.757 --> 08:14.385
I'm getting those other tickets
to the Super Bowl.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.690
Maybe I'll take you, but I doubt it.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.857
You played your cards wrong.

08:19.932 --> 08:24.062
- You backed the wrong pony.
- Why not just dump them all out, Shake?

08:24.136 --> 08:26.036
You don't have to eat all the chips.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.131
But they're so delicious. They torture me.

08:29.208 --> 08:33.804
And when I win, I'm gonna sit next to him
and ride his ass...

08:33.880 --> 08:37.043
'cause I'm not kissing his ass
for one more second.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.676
- Hey, y'all.
- How's that minibike treating you, sport?

08:39.751 --> 08:44.587
I gotta get that back to the place by 5:00,
so, you know, you have fun within reason.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.722
Forget it. I'm done now.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.317
This hog ain't got enough torque
for this man.

08:49.395 --> 08:52.262
Torque? I'll torque...
Get over here in my hands.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.531
I think we need to go get you to a doctor.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.661
What I need to go see is the Super Bowl.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.502
Don't play with my emotions.
Who are you taking?

09:01.574 --> 09:03.872
- Yeah, who are you taking?
- How did you get in here?

09:03.943 --> 09:06.173
The window, jackass. Who are you taking?

09:06.245 --> 09:07.405
This is a box.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.971
Are you out of your freaking mind?
You'll get arrested.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.916
Gentlemen, meet my new best friend...

09:12.985 --> 09:14.350
Boxy Brown.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.417
Meet your new dead best friend.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.287
<i>Fool. Step back.</i>

09:19.358 --> 09:21.622
You best listen to Boxy, now.
He don't play.

09:21.694 --> 09:24.857
Listen to what? He's imaginary, for...

09:25.097 --> 09:28.658
You don't even like feetball.
I'm the number one super fan.

09:28.968 --> 09:31.596
See y'all later.
I'm going to the Super Bowl.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.730
<i>Down in Motown.
You see what I'm saying?</i>

09:33.806 --> 09:35.433
- Have fun, Meatwad.
- Fine!

09:35.508 --> 09:37.533
Go to the Super Bowl, you frigging...

09:37.610 --> 09:41.137
Have fun having empties
thrown into your best friend all day.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.840
I don't feel good.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.783
Carl, will you grab Shake's other hand?
We need to get him to a clinic.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.877
Yeah, sure. I'll do that.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.789
- Carl, are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.693
<i>Carl, you're one crazy...</i>

09:57.096 --> 09:59.564
Great. Now I got diabetes.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.122
The game just started.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.465
What a contest. 55-3 in the first quarter.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.364
Shut it off. Did you hear me?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.035
- The doctor said I have cancer.
- Is that the ticket?

10:14.113 --> 10:17.446
Call a cab. Let's go, come on.
We gotta get to the airport.

10:17.516 --> 10:20.952
We are back.
That was fun, wasn't it, Boxy?

10:21.020 --> 10:24.114
<i>Sure was, brother.
We raised the roof all up in there.</i>

10:24.190 --> 10:28.058
- But the tickets are right here.
- I know. They didn't even want them.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.687
They just sort of, you know,
kind of pecked at us...

10:30.763 --> 10:32.128
like a bunch of chickens.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.894
<i>Sure did, and they was chickens, my man.</i>

10:34.967 --> 10:36.195
<i>It was a hen hizzy.</i>

10:36.268 --> 10:38.998
No, they're professionals.
I doubt they'd use chickens.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.767
<i>- Chickens?
- Fool, do not make him repeat himself.</i>

10:41.841 --> 10:44.241
We got to drink milk straight from a cow...

10:44.310 --> 10:46.574
and then pet a goat, and that goat...

10:46.646 --> 10:49.046
that goat snatched Boxy's arm off,
I tell you.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.878
<i>Sure did, that goat.</i>

10:51.017 --> 10:54.180
There's really no telling
where you've been, now, is there?

10:54.253 --> 10:57.711
Yep, Super Bowls are fun.
We got bragging rights this year.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.782
- Number one.
- Who? Who's number one?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.027
- I don't know.
- You don't know...

11:03.095 --> 11:06.223
because you went to a... farm,
you... imbecile!

11:06.332 --> 11:09.028
Get back here!
You cost me my one chance!

11:09.101 --> 11:11.968
I got... diabetes and cancer because of you!
