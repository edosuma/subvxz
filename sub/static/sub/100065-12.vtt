WEBVTT

00:02.987 --> 00:04.097
Eddie.

00:04.121 --> 00:06.099
Keeping it in the family today, huh?

00:06.123 --> 00:07.934
- Ha, ha.
- What you got?

00:07.958 --> 00:11.070
Vic is Katherine Webster,
41 years of age, D.O.A.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.940
Looks like she was assaulted,
blunt force trauma.

00:13.964 --> 00:16.910
Her husband and her daughter
were at home at the time.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.077
They see anything?

00:18.101 --> 00:21.714
They heard a noise
at 4:00 a.m., they got up

00:21.738 --> 00:24.884
and allegedly saw the perp
jump out the window.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.252
"Allegedly"?

00:26.276 --> 00:27.754
They give a description?

00:27.778 --> 00:30.557
Male, 30s, wearing jeans and a hoodie.

00:30.581 --> 00:32.220
No further details.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.260
You the homicide A.D.A.?

00:34.284 --> 00:35.475
A.D.A. Reagan.

00:35.499 --> 00:36.821
Detective Reggie Hotchkiss.

00:36.845 --> 00:38.048
Murder weapon recovered?

00:38.072 --> 00:39.799
No murder weapon found, no signs

00:39.823 --> 00:41.163
of forced entry.

00:41.187 --> 00:43.153
- And I was talking to the neighbors...
- I'll take it

00:43.177 --> 00:44.202
from here, Officer.

00:44.226 --> 00:46.829
Why don't you go outside,
sit on the family.

00:50.167 --> 00:52.512
No forced entry,
but we got an open window.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.206
Anybody see or hear anything?

00:54.230 --> 00:55.748
No, but we're canvassing
the neighborhood.

00:55.772 --> 00:57.150
M.E. is on the way.

00:57.174 --> 00:58.251
Make sure to get statements

00:58.275 --> 01:00.381
from the other neighbors on the floor.
And the doorman.

01:00.405 --> 01:02.285
- Already on it.
- And the family?

01:02.309 --> 01:03.546
Are across the hall.

01:07.084 --> 01:09.395
Mr. Webster, Amanda,

01:09.419 --> 01:11.531
this is Assistant District
Attorney Erin Reagan

01:11.555 --> 01:13.198
and Investigator Anthony Abetemarco

01:13.222 --> 01:14.233
from the D.A.'s office.

01:14.257 --> 01:15.789
We're very sorry for your loss.

01:15.813 --> 01:18.556
- You see the guy?
- Just his back.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.473
If you're up for it,
we'll have someone bring you

01:20.497 --> 01:22.375
to the precinct
so you can give a statement.

01:22.399 --> 01:23.650
Thank you.

01:24.868 --> 01:26.179
Can you handle that?

01:26.203 --> 01:27.863
Yeah, I can handle that.

01:28.472 --> 01:30.073
Hey, hold on.

01:30.807 --> 01:32.819
Uh, could you take them?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.495
You can come with me.

01:37.748 --> 01:39.258
You okay?

01:39.282 --> 01:42.061
Oh, I'm used to detectives
being territorial.

01:42.085 --> 01:43.386
No offense.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.499
No, I mean...

01:46.523 --> 01:50.336
I don't know, you seem like
you doubt... Webster's story.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.238
Oh.

01:52.262 --> 01:54.664
Something you want to share with us?

01:55.699 --> 01:56.843
Yeah.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.853
Those two are lying through their teeth.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.812 --> 02:10.857
So what does he want to talk to me for?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.425
As it is, this is highly unusual...

02:12.449 --> 02:13.760
a suspect in DEA custody

02:13.784 --> 02:15.561
refusing to talk to anyone but you?

02:15.585 --> 02:16.729
Well, why are you entertaining him?

02:16.753 --> 02:18.064
Because he said if he didn't talk to you,

02:18.088 --> 02:20.566
and only you, alone,
he's not gonna testify

02:20.590 --> 02:21.901
against the Sangriento cartel.

02:21.925 --> 02:24.070
And we need him to make our case.

02:24.509 --> 02:26.239
When's he scheduled to testify?

02:26.263 --> 02:28.641
Day after tomorrow, so
do what you need to do

02:28.665 --> 02:31.277
to make sure he sings
like a bird on the stand.

02:31.301 --> 02:34.103
Nobody's gonna make that guy do anything.

02:39.443 --> 02:43.122
Locked up and still
causing problems, huh?

02:43.647 --> 02:46.459
It's the only thing I'm good at.

02:46.483 --> 02:47.684
How you doing?

02:47.709 --> 02:50.763
Never thought I'd consider
ramen noodles to be a delicacy.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.832
But I brought this on myself.

02:52.856 --> 02:54.300
My kids didn't.

02:54.324 --> 02:55.635
I've been checking in on them.

02:55.659 --> 02:57.035
I know.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.564
I got a message.

03:05.589 --> 03:07.167
- From who?
- Doesn't matter.

03:07.192 --> 03:09.064
The cartel's threatening to kill them.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.712
Did you tell the DEA about it?

03:10.741 --> 03:11.818
No.

03:11.842 --> 03:16.189
I need you to make sure my boys are safe.

03:16.213 --> 03:17.981
What makes you think I'm the guy to help?

03:18.005 --> 03:19.783
Family's like your kryptonite.

03:20.717 --> 03:23.520
And these boys are
the only family I have left.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.782
Hey. What'd he say?

03:44.141 --> 03:45.608
I'll tell you later.

04:00.891 --> 04:02.535
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:02.559 --> 04:05.204
- How are you, Sarge?
- Martin. Roll call's about to start.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.813
I'll be there.

04:25.115 --> 04:26.916
Gunfire!

04:30.287 --> 04:32.288
Gunfire!

04:33.156 --> 04:35.175
Gunfire!

04:35.759 --> 04:38.471
Officer down!

05:12.062 --> 05:14.063
I don't know how you do it.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.945
The consoling. I-I wouldn't
know what to say.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.805
You say as little as possible.

05:22.973 --> 05:25.641
You're there to represent...

05:27.496 --> 05:29.163
...all of us.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.925
Rosemary, this is Commissioner...

06:05.949 --> 06:07.767
I know who he is.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.498
Mrs. Martin, I'm so sorry. I...

06:12.522 --> 06:15.334
Don't. Don't you dare
tell me how sorry you are.

06:15.358 --> 06:16.525
Rosemary.

06:17.459 --> 06:19.070
It's okay.

06:20.330 --> 06:22.208
How many officers have to die

06:22.232 --> 06:24.043
before someone tells the truth,

06:24.067 --> 06:26.712
- that no one has their backs anymore?
- Rosemary, please.

06:26.736 --> 06:28.848
My husband is dead because of you.

06:28.872 --> 06:31.583
So save your damn condolences.

06:55.877 --> 07:03.877
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

07:07.064 --> 07:08.408
Mateo.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.545
- Where's your brother?
- The principal's getting him.

07:11.569 --> 07:13.880
Carlos brought you to school today?

07:13.904 --> 07:15.257
He dropped me off and then he walked

07:15.281 --> 07:16.706
around the corner to his entrance.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.757
Carlos Delgado, is he here?

07:23.781 --> 07:26.560
I'm afraid he didn't make it to school.

07:38.562 --> 07:39.840
Hey.

07:39.864 --> 07:41.008
Hey.

07:41.032 --> 07:42.773
How'd that interview go?

07:42.797 --> 07:44.878
They didn't see much,
nothing we could use,

07:44.902 --> 07:46.213
but two apartments were burglarized

07:46.237 --> 07:47.748
in that building last night.

07:47.772 --> 07:49.249
And you think they're related?

07:49.273 --> 07:51.007
Perp has a history of assault.

07:52.410 --> 07:54.162
What makes you think
they're hiding something?

07:54.186 --> 07:55.756
The way they avoided eye contact,

07:55.780 --> 07:57.728
the way Amanda pulled away from her dad.

07:57.729 --> 08:00.175
The demeanor, the physicality.

08:00.199 --> 08:01.976
It could all be explained by the trauma

08:02.000 --> 08:03.178
of seeing her mother murdered.

08:03.202 --> 08:05.680
Or because they are hiding something.

08:05.704 --> 08:08.683
Okay. I'm gonna need
something more concrete

08:08.707 --> 08:10.474
than just a gut instinct.

08:12.377 --> 08:16.291
Sure. Right. 'Cause I'm not a detective.

08:16.315 --> 08:18.760
So I should just walk away.

08:18.784 --> 08:21.276
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

08:26.425 --> 08:27.925
Thank you, Baker.

08:29.874 --> 08:33.020
Well, it's not often I get to have

08:33.044 --> 08:36.080
my entire God squad in the same room.

08:37.336 --> 08:38.835
So...

08:39.504 --> 08:42.650
Officer Martin is number 11,

08:42.674 --> 08:46.321
which means our ranks have had
more suicides in the last year

08:46.345 --> 08:49.137
than line-of-duty fatalities.

08:49.848 --> 08:51.473
Help me.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.496
Look,

08:55.520 --> 08:57.165
I think we should classify suicides

08:57.189 --> 08:59.167
as line-of-duty fatalities.

08:59.191 --> 09:00.802
No.

09:00.826 --> 09:02.737
No, Frank, they're not.

09:02.761 --> 09:04.505
Then, what?

09:04.529 --> 09:07.141
Not even collateral damages, no.

09:07.165 --> 09:09.811
Well, then help me understand.

09:09.835 --> 09:11.312
And don't hold back.

09:11.336 --> 09:15.037
You weren't asked up here to
spare my feelings or blow smoke.

09:15.061 --> 09:19.854
Well, the job can weigh
on a man, that's natural,

09:19.878 --> 09:22.757
but to cause that man
to take his own life,

09:22.781 --> 09:24.926
he's not in his right mind.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.467
That's not the job's fault.

09:26.491 --> 09:29.631
But the perquisites that used
to alleviate the pressures

09:29.655 --> 09:32.900
of the job have largely disappeared.

09:33.430 --> 09:36.771
The respect for the police
was one of the perks.

09:36.795 --> 09:40.441
Was. But an anti-cop culture
has taken hold,

09:40.465 --> 09:43.111
and not just in our city.

09:43.135 --> 09:45.603
There's a lot of hate
directed at our cops.

09:46.972 --> 09:50.675
Hate is something I can't control, Imam.

09:51.710 --> 09:55.690
But it's harder to hate up close.

09:55.714 --> 09:58.192
We need to keep working
on schooling the public

09:58.216 --> 10:01.157
about what our officers
deal with on a daily basis.

10:01.181 --> 10:04.432
And getting rid of the stigma
for when they ask for help.

10:05.255 --> 10:09.103
Yeah, but you're asking guys to
ask for help who see themselves

10:09.127 --> 10:12.183
as the guys who are doing the saving.

10:12.207 --> 10:15.176
Then we reeducate them.
This is all about outreach.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.678
On a retail level.

10:16.702 --> 10:18.713
Well, that's hard to do with 35,000 cops.

10:18.737 --> 10:22.105
But with God's help, not impossible.

10:27.312 --> 10:29.457
Thank you, gentlemen.

10:29.481 --> 10:32.740
I look forward to your recommendations.

10:34.138 --> 10:37.537
And if you need more resources,
my door is open.

10:57.576 --> 10:59.620
You think you've got
some kind of special privilege

10:59.644 --> 11:01.522
'cause I'm a Catholic?

11:02.103 --> 11:04.359
You know what I think?

11:04.383 --> 11:07.017
Rosemary Martin got to you.

11:10.435 --> 11:13.865
Every time I lose an officer,
it gets to me, Father.

11:14.726 --> 11:17.862
People in pain say a lot
of things they don't mean.

11:20.665 --> 11:23.177
Can't you do better than that, Walter?

11:23.201 --> 11:26.814
Frank, there were other
complications in his life.

11:26.838 --> 11:28.383
Like what?

11:28.407 --> 11:30.385
I'm not at liberty to say.

11:30.409 --> 11:32.820
Oh, so you want me to blame myself.

11:32.844 --> 11:34.589
You're gonna blame yourself,

11:34.613 --> 11:37.081
and you're gonna
carry it around with you.

11:40.585 --> 11:42.797
Don't get all holy on me, Walter.

11:42.821 --> 11:45.222
There's nothing anyone could have done.

11:47.092 --> 11:48.403
And that's it?

11:48.427 --> 11:52.273
You know the stress of this
job better than anyone.

11:52.297 --> 11:55.843
The terrible stuff we see
on a daily basis.

11:55.867 --> 11:58.546
You add into that the anti-cop sentiment

11:58.570 --> 12:00.748
and daily access to guns.

12:01.412 --> 12:03.985
I refuse to believe it's impossible

12:04.009 --> 12:06.167
to prevent another suicide.

12:07.043 --> 12:09.891
We've prevented dozens of suicides.

12:09.915 --> 12:12.090
And one is still too many.

12:12.943 --> 12:14.550
Always will be.

12:24.896 --> 12:26.597
Hi.

12:27.632 --> 12:28.843
Hi.

12:28.867 --> 12:31.112
I wanted to come by
and see how you're doing,

12:31.136 --> 12:34.015
and let you know that you're not alone.

12:34.039 --> 12:35.416
And, you know, maybe,

12:35.440 --> 12:38.252
you thought of something that
you didn't think of before.

12:38.276 --> 12:39.420
Like what?

12:39.444 --> 12:41.189
Well, maybe you didn't see someone

12:41.213 --> 12:42.818
climbing out of that window.

12:42.842 --> 12:44.122
What are you doing?

12:45.331 --> 12:47.083
Amanda, go sit in the car.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.465
What do you think you're
doing showing up here?

12:50.489 --> 12:51.779
We're both on the same team.

12:51.803 --> 12:53.423
My daughter's been through enough.

12:54.025 --> 12:55.860
Don't come near her again.

13:02.584 --> 13:04.198
We checked every plate on the block?

13:04.223 --> 13:06.214
Every one in a three-block radius.

13:06.238 --> 13:08.082
TARU's going through
security footage right now.

13:08.106 --> 13:09.517
What about Carlos's phone?

13:09.541 --> 13:11.451
It last pinged in Washington Heights.

13:11.475 --> 13:13.588
- Hey, Reagan.
- Yeah?

13:13.612 --> 13:14.922
We got video.

13:14.946 --> 13:16.090
We got a plate?

13:16.114 --> 13:18.926
Came back stolen. Put out an alarm,

13:18.950 --> 13:20.361
run it through license plate readers.

13:20.385 --> 13:21.629
You guys always make it a habit

13:21.653 --> 13:23.898
of keeping secrets
during active investigations?

13:23.922 --> 13:25.700
Delgado asked us not to say anything

13:25.724 --> 13:27.835
until he knew his kids
were safe. Okay? Relax.

13:27.859 --> 13:29.136
And look how that turned out.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.672
- Who told Delgado not to testify?
- I don't know.

13:31.696 --> 13:33.374
Could have fooled me. You could have said

13:33.398 --> 13:35.009
Delgado told you his sons were in danger.

13:35.033 --> 13:37.545
He's about to testify against
one of the biggest drug cartels

13:37.569 --> 13:38.946
in North America.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.716
It didn't occur to you that
his kids could be in danger?

13:41.740 --> 13:43.584
It didn't occur to you before
they went after your wife.

13:43.608 --> 13:44.919
- Did it?
- Hey!

13:44.943 --> 13:46.109
What is wrong with you?

13:46.133 --> 13:47.729
Guys, Patrol has the car.

13:47.753 --> 13:48.776
Washington Heights.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.576
Corner of Riverside and 166th.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.017
Great. Let's go.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.799
The person that called it in around?

14:08.823 --> 14:10.434
Not a soul here when we rolled up.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.768
Anybody else in the vehicle?

14:11.792 --> 14:14.271
No. We called it in
as soon as we got here.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.576
Is that blood?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.012
Yeah.

14:22.036 --> 14:24.068
Get CSU down here forthwith.

14:24.092 --> 14:25.382
We got any bodies inside?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.883
No.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.018
Hello?

14:28.042 --> 14:29.419
Please,

14:29.443 --> 14:31.087
Help me.

14:31.111 --> 14:33.423
Carlos? Where are you?

14:33.447 --> 14:34.791
If my dad testifies,

14:34.815 --> 14:37.093
they said they're gonna kill me.

14:37.117 --> 14:38.762
No, Carlos, nobody's gonna
kill you, okay?

14:38.786 --> 14:40.263
But you got to tell me where you are.

14:40.287 --> 14:42.055
Do you have any idea where you are?

14:43.090 --> 14:45.469
Give Delgado the message.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.494
Hello?

14:55.293 --> 14:56.703
Ms. Reagan?

14:56.727 --> 14:58.546
Yes. What can I do for you?

14:58.570 --> 15:01.143
For starters, if you have
questions for my daughter,

15:01.168 --> 15:02.312
you should go through me.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.713
- Oh, I...
- And don't have cops

15:03.737 --> 15:06.049
sitting on my home, violating my privacy.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.717
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.458
You had an officer confront Amanda

15:09.482 --> 15:12.226
about her mother's murder
right outside my home.

15:12.227 --> 15:14.072
I think you might be mistaken.

15:14.096 --> 15:16.719
U-Um, did this officer
identify themselves?

15:16.743 --> 15:18.209
Officer Edit Janko.

15:18.233 --> 15:19.744
The one that was at my apartment.

15:19.768 --> 15:23.571
If it happens again, I'm filing
an order of protection.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.858
And according to Rosemary Martin,

15:33.882 --> 15:35.860
the current rash of police suicides

15:35.884 --> 15:39.864
can be attributed to the current
NYPD commissioner Frank Reagan.

15:40.381 --> 15:43.899
"He doesn't stand up for his cops.

15:43.923 --> 15:46.137
"He's not doing enough
to prevent suicides

15:46.161 --> 15:48.039
"among the rank and file.

15:48.063 --> 15:50.441
They have no support system."

15:50.465 --> 15:52.533
End quote.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.282
Everyone will see that for what it is:

15:57.306 --> 16:00.785
a grieving widow lashing out
at an easy target.

16:00.809 --> 16:03.521
She also retained
a lawyer who sent a letter

16:03.545 --> 16:06.057
to the Legal Bureau demanding
access to the results

16:06.081 --> 16:09.016
of our investigation
into her husband's death.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.537
So?

16:12.254 --> 16:14.232
Releasing the results
would certainly put an end

16:14.256 --> 16:16.791
to her blaming you for
her husband's death.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.756
That's not really the point.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.275
Apparently, Officer Martin

16:28.299 --> 16:29.799
went out one night,

16:29.823 --> 16:32.940
off duty, hooked up with a pro.

16:36.845 --> 16:39.857
So? He's no angel.

16:40.682 --> 16:43.961
Who was also a grifter who
took his watch and credit cards

16:43.985 --> 16:45.496
and took photographs.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.165
Explicit photos of Officer Martin

16:47.189 --> 16:49.951
in compromising positions.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.123
I'm not gonna look at that.

16:57.165 --> 17:01.346
Compromising positions
is a pretty vague term.

17:01.370 --> 17:02.780
Well, it's blackmail.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.549
The "Or else" being she was
gonna go to the department

17:04.573 --> 17:06.851
and his wife with the photos.

17:06.875 --> 17:09.186
The investigation
determined that this was

17:09.211 --> 17:11.945
the main contributing factor
in his suicide.

17:13.248 --> 17:16.828
There's no way
she knows any of this stuff.

17:16.852 --> 17:18.496
She wouldn't be skewering you
in the media

17:18.520 --> 17:20.131
if she knew the real truth.

17:20.155 --> 17:21.566
Exactly.

17:21.589 --> 17:23.233
So, what are you gonna do, boss?

17:24.151 --> 17:26.204
I need to see her.

17:26.228 --> 17:29.107
Just send the results of the
investigation to her lawyer.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.158
She's a police widow.
She deserves a face-to-face.

17:32.182 --> 17:33.644
From what I heard of your last encounter,

17:33.668 --> 17:36.180
- I strongly advise against that.
- I agree.

17:36.204 --> 17:38.139
It's my job.

17:39.207 --> 17:41.519
It's the hardest part of it,

17:41.543 --> 17:45.423
but it's also
the most important part of it.

17:46.047 --> 17:48.801
And no matter how she feels about me,

17:50.051 --> 17:52.096
she gets a pass.

17:53.221 --> 17:55.533
My shoulders will just have
to be broad enough

17:55.557 --> 17:58.058
to take some of the weight off of hers.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.599
Hi.

18:15.577 --> 18:17.422
Eddie, did you speak to Amanda Webster

18:17.446 --> 18:19.276
about her mother's death

18:19.300 --> 18:20.658
while off duty?

18:21.208 --> 18:22.560
Yes, I did.

18:22.584 --> 18:23.694
What are you doing?

18:23.718 --> 18:25.852
I am making sure a 16-year-old girl

18:25.876 --> 18:28.055
doesn't get railroaded into lying.

18:28.079 --> 18:30.034
And what if she was the one who did it?

18:30.058 --> 18:31.908
I don't know.
Maybe she would've confessed.

18:31.932 --> 18:33.438
You're not a trained investigator.

18:33.462 --> 18:35.973
When we were partners,
you and I would always

18:35.997 --> 18:37.875
follow up when we thought
something wasn't right.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.944
But this is a murder charge,
and you speaking

18:39.968 --> 18:43.448
to Amanda Webster on your own
complicates things.

18:43.472 --> 18:45.683
Mr. Webster already complained that
his daughter was being harassed.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.218
Since when is asking questions
harassment?

18:47.242 --> 18:48.873
They got spooked,
they're not cooperating.

18:48.897 --> 18:50.757
Because they're hiding something.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.123
Guilty or innocent,

18:52.147 --> 18:54.592
this girl is crying out for help.

18:54.616 --> 18:56.894
I get it. You think you saw something...

18:56.918 --> 19:00.498
- I know I saw something.
- I cannot make a case based

19:00.522 --> 19:01.899
on gut instincts.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.568
I need facts, I need evidence.

19:03.592 --> 19:05.069
And I would be saying this to Jamie,

19:05.093 --> 19:07.371
I'd be saying it to Danny,
I'd be saying it to any Reagan.

19:07.395 --> 19:08.573
- I...
- But, see, I'm not a Reagan.

19:08.597 --> 19:10.141
What are you talking about?

19:10.165 --> 19:13.478
I'm one of you, but I am not like you.

19:13.502 --> 19:16.481
I didn't grow up with a dad
who is a paragon of virtue,

19:16.505 --> 19:17.982
who breaks bread with me every Sunday.

19:18.006 --> 19:20.751
I bring something different to the table.

19:20.775 --> 19:22.553
I don't have good instincts

19:22.577 --> 19:23.888
because I'm a cop.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.058
I have good instincts
'cause my dad is a criminal.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.227
And so I felt compelled to help you

19:29.251 --> 19:33.072
because I see something in this girl...

19:33.922 --> 19:36.534
I see something you can't see.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.845
You can't tell Delgado
his son is missing.

19:47.869 --> 19:49.146
- He doesn't know?
- No.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.615
Are you kidding me?

19:50.639 --> 19:53.784
If he knows the cartel has
Carlos, he won't testify.

19:53.808 --> 19:56.487
So you expect us to lie
to the guy about his own kids?

19:56.511 --> 19:58.679
Without Delgado, we don't
have enough to convict.

20:11.359 --> 20:13.137
Did you get my boys?

20:13.161 --> 20:16.301
Got 'em both.
Put 'em in protective custody.

20:16.325 --> 20:18.268
They're going into witness protection.

20:18.292 --> 20:20.344
That's the only way to make sure
they're both safe.

20:20.368 --> 20:22.380
And after you testify,
we'll get you transferred

20:22.404 --> 20:23.648
to another prison that's near them

20:23.672 --> 20:24.872
so we can arrange visits.

20:32.587 --> 20:34.254
This true?

20:35.717 --> 20:39.219
Mateo is in a secure location.

20:42.657 --> 20:45.426
But Carlos never made it to school.

20:46.580 --> 20:47.981
What the hell is wrong with you?

20:52.267 --> 20:53.578
Delgado!

20:53.602 --> 20:54.695
Wait, wait!

20:55.570 --> 20:57.315
- Get off of him!
- Come on!

20:59.908 --> 21:01.185
Take it easy.

21:01.209 --> 21:03.421
Who gave you the message they
were coming after your boys?

21:03.445 --> 21:04.922
Guards!

21:05.539 --> 21:07.992
Look, we got about two seconds
before they yank us out of here.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.544
Now give us a name
so we can help find your son.

21:13.755 --> 21:16.824
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.236
Bring him back to his cell!

21:19.260 --> 21:21.505
Hey. What'd he say to you?

21:21.529 --> 21:23.574
He said he wasn't gonna testify

21:23.598 --> 21:25.392
until we found his son.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.954
Happy now?

21:39.281 --> 21:40.524
Hey.

21:40.548 --> 21:41.759
How's it going?

21:41.783 --> 21:44.261
Well, somehow I've become
the bad guy with Eddie.

21:44.285 --> 21:46.931
She thinks Jamie and I
are working against her.

21:46.955 --> 21:48.599
I can understand that.

21:48.623 --> 21:50.368
You can understand that why?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.837
E-Eh, you're a tough bunch, you Reagans.

21:52.861 --> 21:54.271
You always play offense.

21:54.295 --> 21:55.610
That is not true.

21:55.634 --> 21:56.607
Yes, it is.

21:56.631 --> 21:58.273
And to be honest, I
wouldn't want to be her

21:58.297 --> 22:00.778
at that Sunday dinner
table with you guys.

22:00.802 --> 22:02.013
Because why?

22:02.037 --> 22:04.682
Because she's the low man
on the totem pole.

22:04.706 --> 22:07.351
She's the lowest-ranking member
of the department,

22:07.375 --> 22:11.055
and frankly, the lowest-ranking
member of the Reagan family.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.390
What are you talking about?

22:12.414 --> 22:13.791
She married in.

22:13.815 --> 22:17.151
She's literally
the only outsider at that table.

22:18.586 --> 22:19.963
Well, I didn't think of that.

22:19.988 --> 22:21.299
And, listen, you guys are great.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.900
You're all great at your jobs,

22:22.924 --> 22:26.003
uh, you're confident a-and you kick ass,

22:26.027 --> 22:28.163
and it's hard to compete.

22:33.535 --> 22:35.312
Is that what you came here to say?

22:35.336 --> 22:37.982
No. I came here to tell you
that Mrs. Webster

22:38.006 --> 22:40.484
was having an affair
with her husband's best friend.

22:40.508 --> 22:43.120
Wow. So you think he did it?

22:43.144 --> 22:44.622
Were not sure yet,

22:44.646 --> 22:47.815
but, uh, sure gives Mr. Webster motive.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.238
Frank.

23:01.262 --> 23:03.097
Have a seat.

23:17.412 --> 23:19.757
I invited him to come.

23:20.815 --> 23:24.829
Someone dies, we automatically
look for a reason.

23:24.853 --> 23:27.231
Something, or someone, to blame.

23:27.255 --> 23:29.333
I know who to blame.

23:29.357 --> 23:32.002
I've been at this a long time,
and I know that it's never

23:32.026 --> 23:34.543
one thing or one person or one reason

23:34.567 --> 23:36.635
that causes someone
to take their own life.

23:36.659 --> 23:38.976
Okay, then, Father, give me the list.

23:39.526 --> 23:43.948
My husband is the 11th cop
to commit suicide this year.

23:43.972 --> 23:45.683
What are you doing about it?

23:45.707 --> 23:47.826
Everything I can.

23:48.952 --> 23:50.788
You know what it's like
to tell a ten-year-old

23:50.812 --> 23:53.113
that his father ate his gun?

23:54.349 --> 23:56.660
He asked why.

23:57.211 --> 23:59.253
What do I tell him?

24:04.093 --> 24:06.771
My husband was a good husband,
a good father

24:06.795 --> 24:09.440
and a damn good cop,
and he didn't deserve this.

24:09.464 --> 24:11.776
My son doesn't deserve this.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.444
Of course he doesn't.

24:13.468 --> 24:15.179
I didn't come here for sympathy.

24:15.562 --> 24:18.502
My lawyer requested the results
of the NYPD investigation

24:18.526 --> 24:20.401
into my husband's death.

24:24.279 --> 24:25.923
I'm aware.

24:25.947 --> 24:27.908
Will that be forthcoming?

24:32.620 --> 24:34.621
I'm afraid not.

24:38.326 --> 24:39.837
Why?

24:40.328 --> 24:42.907
What are you trying to hide?

24:43.966 --> 24:47.077
I can tell you that by all accounts,

24:47.101 --> 24:49.914
your husband was
an exceptional police officer

24:49.938 --> 24:51.640
with a stellar record.

24:53.392 --> 24:54.585
I know that.

24:54.609 --> 24:57.813
I want access
to your internal investigation.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.986
Mrs. Martin...

25:06.354 --> 25:10.000
...you are looking for a reason
to explain this tragedy.

25:10.024 --> 25:13.671
I am afraid that you
will never find a reason

25:13.695 --> 25:16.248
good enough to explain it.

25:21.114 --> 25:22.963
You go to hell.

25:39.354 --> 25:42.643
All I'm saying, Francis,
yes he is he should've thought

25:42.667 --> 25:44.191
about his son
before he pulled the trigger.

25:45.193 --> 25:47.405
It's a complicated issue.

25:47.429 --> 25:50.241
A permanent solution
for a temporary problem.

25:50.265 --> 25:52.667
Isn't that the saying?

25:53.887 --> 25:55.580
I mean, I just don't understand.

25:55.604 --> 25:58.306
Like, why do so many cops
kill themselves anyway?

26:01.877 --> 26:03.321
The stress of the job.

26:03.754 --> 26:05.797
It's easy access to a gun.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.510
The cumulative trauma of the job.

26:10.946 --> 26:13.591
And too proud to ask for help.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.968
Most days, you're faced
with the worst of humankind

26:16.992 --> 26:19.260
and the most vulnerable victims.

26:20.295 --> 26:21.668
Sorry, I'm late.

26:21.692 --> 26:22.774
Hey.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.108
I'll warm up your dinner.

26:24.132 --> 26:26.344
No, it's okay, Gramps. I'll have dessert.

26:26.902 --> 26:28.546
Okay.

26:28.570 --> 26:30.815
How many hours you been on duty?

26:30.839 --> 26:32.684
- Don't know.
- 22 straight.

26:33.367 --> 26:35.520
You're not gonna be any help to anyone

26:35.544 --> 26:37.155
if you try to function like that.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.556
I know,

26:38.580 --> 26:41.292
but I, but I got a ticking
clock, you know? A kidnapping.

26:41.316 --> 26:42.560
- Okay.
- Funny how

26:42.584 --> 26:43.861
he was your sworn enemy,

26:43.885 --> 26:45.920
and now here you are trying to help him.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.290
He lost his wife.

26:52.594 --> 26:54.138
Yeah.

26:54.162 --> 26:57.164
Enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

27:01.169 --> 27:02.680
Sometimes you think someone's your friend

27:02.704 --> 27:04.705
and then it turns out they're not.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.720
You want to expand on that?

27:08.744 --> 27:10.488
Can we talk about this later?

27:10.512 --> 27:12.323
Why don't you and Erin
talk about this later

27:12.347 --> 27:13.647
and let me know what you come up with?

27:14.426 --> 27:16.561
That seems to be
how it works in this family.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.204
W-What did I miss?

27:19.588 --> 27:22.767
It seems like Eddie's mad at
Aunt Erin and Uncle Jamie for...

27:22.791 --> 27:24.268
something.

27:24.292 --> 27:25.737
- Easy, Sean.
- What?

27:25.761 --> 27:27.171
Are we just supposed to
pretend that we don't notice

27:27.195 --> 27:29.374
the Arctic chill coming
from that side of the table?

27:29.398 --> 27:31.042
Just a misunderstanding, all right?

27:31.066 --> 27:33.544
Yes, I didn't understand
that I'm not entitled to have

27:33.568 --> 27:36.796
an opinion about any significant
crimes that happen on my watch.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.617
What you're supposed to do
is follow proper protocol.

27:39.641 --> 27:42.037
Oh, right, like all of you guys do?

27:42.061 --> 27:43.921
She has a point there.

27:43.945 --> 27:45.423
You don't know anything about this,

27:45.447 --> 27:46.999
and you think
you can put in your two cents?

27:47.023 --> 27:49.894
Well, I get the gist.
You have some thoughts

27:49.918 --> 27:52.330
on a case that's going
on, and your husband

27:52.354 --> 27:56.267
and your sister-in-law want
you to just back off. Right?

27:56.291 --> 27:58.436
- Pretty much.
- Danny, you're out of line.

27:58.460 --> 28:00.538
Maybe so, Gramps, but I've made a career

28:00.562 --> 28:02.206
out of following my gut,

28:02.230 --> 28:04.642
despite people telling me to back off.

28:04.666 --> 28:05.977
So don't back off.

28:06.001 --> 28:07.779
Go with your gut.

28:07.803 --> 28:09.755
It's all we got.

28:14.576 --> 28:17.649
Emmanuel Garcia spoke
with Jose Flores last week

28:17.673 --> 28:19.150
- while he was incarcerated.
- Uh-huh.

28:19.174 --> 28:21.125
One call for six minutes,
another for four.

28:21.149 --> 28:22.794
Well, what's this Flores's deal?

28:22.818 --> 28:25.190
The Feds say he's a hit man
for Mano Sangriento.

28:25.214 --> 28:26.931
- Of course.
- I have a recording of the call.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.533
- Good, we'll...
- What the hell are you two doing?

28:28.557 --> 28:30.101
- What?
- You put in a request

28:30.125 --> 28:32.970
for phone records of an inmate
at the same facility as Delgado?

28:32.994 --> 28:34.172
- So?
- So, that means

28:34.196 --> 28:35.673
Delgado gave you a name.

28:35.697 --> 28:37.275
Emmanuel Garcia?

28:37.299 --> 28:38.976
You're withholding information.
You said...

28:39.000 --> 28:41.446
You asked us to lie
to a father about his son.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.019
No, I asked you to help
get Delgado to testify.

28:44.043 --> 28:45.516
Yeah, that's because
all you give a damn about

28:45.540 --> 28:46.851
is Delgado's testimony.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.686
You're damn right, because I can
save hundreds of lives

28:48.710 --> 28:49.854
if I nail the Clam.

28:49.878 --> 28:51.522
Well, we're trying to save one life.

28:51.546 --> 28:53.858
The life of a little boy.

28:53.882 --> 28:55.883
That's what we care about.

28:57.185 --> 28:58.830
Officer Janko, you got a minute?

28:58.854 --> 29:00.198
We're bringing in a collar.

29:00.222 --> 29:02.233
Gomez can process the arrest.

29:02.257 --> 29:03.475
Come with me.

29:09.798 --> 29:12.443
I thought there were a few
things that we should talk about.

29:12.467 --> 29:14.212
I hope you're not looking for an apology,

29:14.236 --> 29:15.379
'cause there isn't one coming.

29:15.403 --> 29:17.782
- Eddie.
- I mean, I don't care who I piss off.

29:17.806 --> 29:19.283
I'm always gonna go the extra mile

29:19.307 --> 29:20.685
if I think someone's lying.

29:20.709 --> 29:22.353
- Eddie.
- Are you done?

29:22.377 --> 29:24.455
Yeah, I'm done. Can I go to work?

29:24.479 --> 29:25.623
No.

29:25.647 --> 29:27.291
Eh, there might be something

29:27.315 --> 29:28.793
in the water at that Reagan house.

29:28.817 --> 29:30.361
I'm telling you.

29:30.385 --> 29:31.877
What-what are you talking about, Anthony?

29:31.901 --> 29:35.066
Uh, you can't go back to work
because Erin requested

29:35.090 --> 29:37.384
to use you on this case.

29:37.926 --> 29:39.337
What?

29:39.361 --> 29:42.140
I'm going to reinterview Amanda
Webster, and I thought it would

29:42.164 --> 29:44.342
be worth it to have you there,
because you're right.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.511
You do see things differently,

29:46.535 --> 29:47.979
and I thought we could use that.

29:48.562 --> 29:49.803
Oh.

29:51.145 --> 29:52.612
I'll see you outside.

29:54.442 --> 29:56.387
I really stepped in that, didn't I?

29:56.411 --> 29:57.989
- No kidding.
- You could've stopped me.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.157
I tried.

29:59.181 --> 30:00.782
Man.

30:04.578 --> 30:06.497
You tell Delgado if he opens his mouth,

30:06.521 --> 30:10.368
his sons are gonna suffer
a long, slow, painful death.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.085
You got that?

30:13.261 --> 30:14.739
Where's Delgado's son?

30:14.763 --> 30:16.340
- I don't know.
- You delivered the threat.

30:16.364 --> 30:17.441
You know where he is.

30:17.465 --> 30:18.676
Hey, I'm just the messenger, man.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.778
- Messenger for who?
- Kiss my ass.

30:21.469 --> 30:24.248
You know, I got a better idea.

30:24.272 --> 30:27.775
How about you kiss my ass instead?

30:30.412 --> 30:32.390
That's my wife!

30:32.414 --> 30:34.425
Settle down. You don't
want her to go into labor.

30:34.449 --> 30:36.093
Get those cuffs off.

30:36.117 --> 30:38.529
Your wife was pulled over
for a broken taillight.

30:38.553 --> 30:41.232
The cop that pulled her over
found a gun in her car.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.134
I told you it's not mine.

30:43.158 --> 30:45.136
So, she's gonna be sent
down to central booking,

30:45.160 --> 30:48.206
strip-searched and maybe
some time tomorrow,

30:48.230 --> 30:50.441
- she'll be arraigned.
- Actually, the gun was fully loaded,

30:50.465 --> 30:52.710
so she's not making bail any time soon.

30:52.734 --> 30:55.079
Unless of course, you're
willing to cooperate,

30:55.103 --> 30:57.848
in which case, maybe we might
be able to work something out

30:57.872 --> 30:59.758
and she can go home.

31:00.475 --> 31:02.385
What do you say, tough guy?

31:03.011 --> 31:05.846
Okay, your wife will have
your baby in jail. Let's go.

31:08.016 --> 31:09.627
No! Okay, all right.

31:09.651 --> 31:11.295
All right.

31:11.319 --> 31:14.273
Look, all I know is that
Carlos is being held upstate.

31:14.297 --> 31:17.034
- Where?
- At a cabin. They got, like,

31:17.058 --> 31:18.769
400 acres up there, okay?

31:18.793 --> 31:20.995
Is Delgado's son still alive?

31:33.642 --> 31:34.960
Go.

31:35.543 --> 31:37.213
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

31:37.237 --> 31:38.759
Move it! Let's go!

31:38.783 --> 31:40.214
Move!

31:51.092 --> 31:52.870
Danny?

31:52.894 --> 31:55.162
- Dogs have a scent!
- Let's go.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.547
Go, go! Move out!

32:03.571 --> 32:05.850
Move, move, move, move!

32:05.874 --> 32:07.852
Go, go, go!

32:13.882 --> 32:15.375
Carlos!

32:17.231 --> 32:18.665
Carlos?

32:19.187 --> 32:21.555
Police. Turn your head away.

32:26.294 --> 32:29.296
It's okay. It's okay.

32:30.398 --> 32:32.043
We're gonna get you
out of here, all right?

32:32.067 --> 32:35.854
He's all right. He's okay.
Let's get him a bus.

32:41.407 --> 32:42.453
Where's my dad?

32:42.477 --> 32:45.239
We wanted to speak to you
without your father.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.519
Everything you say to us will stay here.

32:47.543 --> 32:49.367
Well, I don't have anything to say.

32:49.391 --> 32:51.412
Well, then just listen.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.464
I see you...

32:54.489 --> 32:56.567
when your dad's around,
you-you hang back.

32:56.592 --> 32:58.337
You don't look at him.

32:58.362 --> 33:00.306
You kind of move away from him.

33:00.331 --> 33:02.205
- No, I don't.
- I recognize it

33:02.230 --> 33:04.932
'cause it's something
I used to do with my own dad.

33:06.094 --> 33:07.605
What do you mean?

33:07.630 --> 33:09.230
My dad was a criminal.

33:10.352 --> 33:11.929
I didn't want anybody to know.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.080
And so I would cover for him
and I would make

33:16.104 --> 33:17.382
excuses for him.

33:17.406 --> 33:20.206
Right? Because I thought
that if I did that,

33:20.231 --> 33:22.709
if I pretended everything was okay,

33:22.734 --> 33:23.878
then everything would be.

33:24.246 --> 33:25.823
And what happened?

33:25.847 --> 33:27.481
My dad went to jail.

33:29.751 --> 33:34.169
And from that point on,
I-I made my own choices,

33:34.193 --> 33:38.551
and I made a promise to myself
that I would always do

33:38.575 --> 33:40.638
whatever I thought was right.

33:40.662 --> 33:43.341
I decided it didn't matter who he was,

33:43.365 --> 33:45.632
it doesn't define who I am.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.547
Is that why you're a cop?

33:49.969 --> 33:51.872
That's why I'm a cop.

33:53.375 --> 33:55.763
I know... I know what
you're feeling right now.

33:55.787 --> 33:57.845
I know what you're feeling, okay?

33:59.247 --> 34:03.191
But lying about your mom's murder...

34:04.152 --> 34:05.953
is gonna haunt you forever...

34:07.782 --> 34:09.860
...if what you're telling us isn't true.

34:09.885 --> 34:11.830
It's not true.

34:11.855 --> 34:12.831
Okay.

34:12.857 --> 34:14.639
So there wasn't an intruder?

34:14.665 --> 34:15.829
No.

34:16.531 --> 34:18.581
So what happened?

34:18.900 --> 34:20.433
They were fighting...

34:21.882 --> 34:24.695
...'cause my dad found out
that my mom cheated on him,

34:24.719 --> 34:27.532
and he-he lost it.

34:27.556 --> 34:31.594
He-he pushed her really hard,
and then she slammed her head.

34:33.962 --> 34:36.388
But I-I swear he didn't mean to kill her.

34:36.413 --> 34:38.744
It was an accident. I'm so sorry.

34:38.768 --> 34:40.146
I didn't want to lie.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.063
You did good.

34:58.567 --> 35:01.012
The Feds want to change my identity,

35:01.037 --> 35:02.748
put me in witness protection.

35:02.773 --> 35:03.918
Hmm.

35:05.694 --> 35:08.298
Well, you better change
your wardrobe, too.

35:09.230 --> 35:11.208
You're gonna stick out like a sore thumb

35:11.233 --> 35:13.668
you show up dressed like that
in east cupcake.

35:19.294 --> 35:21.137
Maybe I should change my name
to "Danny Reagan."

35:21.161 --> 35:22.907
I hear he's a badass.

35:22.931 --> 35:26.144
But in actuality, he's a family guy,

35:26.168 --> 35:28.212
a widower,

35:28.236 --> 35:30.820
who just wants to raise his two boys.

35:32.980 --> 35:34.457
Me, too.

35:34.991 --> 35:37.445
You got to spend
some time with your boys.

35:40.682 --> 35:43.041
Y-Yeah. Uh...

35:44.078 --> 35:45.668
Yeah, I did.

35:53.361 --> 35:55.261
I don't know how to thank you.

36:01.970 --> 36:03.704
You can...

36:05.600 --> 36:08.168
...thank me by getting on that stand...

36:10.205 --> 36:11.849
...and putting away the sons of bitches

36:11.874 --> 36:13.875
who did this to our families.

36:21.256 --> 36:23.157
Will do.

36:29.197 --> 36:30.965
Delgado, you're up.

36:53.113 --> 36:54.724
Hey.

36:54.856 --> 36:57.186
So Mr. Webster retained a lawyer,

36:57.211 --> 36:59.156
but it looks like he's gonna cooperate,

36:59.181 --> 37:02.027
save, uh, Amanda from having to testify.

37:02.052 --> 37:03.863
That's the least he can do,

37:03.888 --> 37:05.622
considering he had her lie for him.

37:07.882 --> 37:11.595
It really was something
watching you open up to her,

37:11.620 --> 37:13.521
getting her to confess.

37:14.709 --> 37:17.011
Well, glad I could help.

37:18.098 --> 37:20.299
All those things you said
about your dad...

37:21.449 --> 37:23.308
Are all true.

37:23.431 --> 37:25.976
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know.

37:26.001 --> 37:28.736
Well, how could you?
I never talked about it.

37:31.519 --> 37:34.498
Listen, I-I know that
I complicated things for you...

37:34.523 --> 37:36.835
No, you-you had good instincts.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.205
No, but I went about it all wrong

37:39.230 --> 37:40.841
and I came on way too strong.

37:40.866 --> 37:43.078
What, like a Reagan?

37:43.578 --> 37:47.275
What I meant when I made that
comment about not being a Reagan

37:47.300 --> 37:50.746
is... sometimes I'm sitting
at that dinner table

37:50.771 --> 37:52.348
and I look around

37:52.373 --> 37:55.352
and... I don't know...
you're all just so...

37:55.377 --> 37:56.955
outspoken.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.457
You say whatever you're thinking,

37:58.482 --> 38:00.260
and you put it all out there.

38:00.285 --> 38:01.563
And that's great.

38:01.588 --> 38:06.235
I-I just was brought up
the complete opposite,

38:06.260 --> 38:09.306
and sometimes I-I hold back.

38:09.331 --> 38:11.609
Well, you didn't this time.

38:11.634 --> 38:16.214
Because this time
I was looking in a mirror, Erin.

38:16.239 --> 38:18.618
Amanda Webster was me.

38:18.907 --> 38:21.558
Well, because of you,
we were able to save her

38:21.582 --> 38:24.945
from living a lie,
and that's-that's a win.

38:27.715 --> 38:29.726
You know, not if I alienated you.

38:30.583 --> 38:33.443
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to alienate me.

38:33.468 --> 38:34.745
Besides,

38:34.770 --> 38:36.537
I think we should stick together.

38:36.562 --> 38:38.251
There's way too much testosterone

38:38.276 --> 38:39.987
at that family dinner, don't you think?

38:40.012 --> 38:42.095
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

38:42.597 --> 38:45.676
And may the souls
of the faithful departed,

38:45.700 --> 38:49.680
through the mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

38:49.704 --> 38:51.249
rest in peace.

38:51.273 --> 38:52.416
Amen.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.874
Amen.

39:03.004 --> 39:06.006
When I look out at all of you,
I immediately think of Tommy.

39:07.601 --> 39:10.206
I thought he looked so handsome
in his uniform.

39:11.899 --> 39:15.294
I've always been proud
to be a cop's wife,

39:15.856 --> 39:17.901
but when Tommy took his life last week,

39:17.926 --> 39:21.639
I won't lie,
that I blamed the department,

39:21.664 --> 39:24.977
the commissioner, the job, myself,

39:25.002 --> 39:27.974
and anyone else I could think of

39:28.092 --> 39:30.637
for leaving me alone, and our son Travis

39:30.662 --> 39:32.520
without a father.

39:35.116 --> 39:37.661
I've spent a ton of time wondering

39:37.686 --> 39:41.612
what went through Tommy's head
before he pulled the trigger,

39:42.416 --> 39:44.384
and I don't know the answer.

39:46.561 --> 39:47.905
I wish he'd known

39:47.929 --> 39:52.310
that we would do anything
in this world to help him.

39:52.334 --> 39:54.348
I wish he'd thought about asking

39:54.372 --> 39:58.004
for help from us or from one of you

39:58.029 --> 40:01.131
or from one of the department
programs that are out there.

40:02.811 --> 40:05.990
It takes courage
to stand up to our enemies,

40:06.015 --> 40:08.026
but it takes just as much courage

40:08.051 --> 40:10.391
to stand up to our weaknesses.

40:11.252 --> 40:12.396
So,

40:12.420 --> 40:15.605
if any of you ever feel like life

40:15.630 --> 40:18.899
is more than you can handle,
reach out to someone for help.

40:28.969 --> 40:30.436
How's she doing?

40:31.651 --> 40:33.706
She's doing just fine.

40:34.776 --> 40:36.910
You think it's helping?

40:38.632 --> 40:40.166
I think it is.

40:42.010 --> 40:43.925
I don't know.

40:44.952 --> 40:48.255
I'm still not sure it was a good idea.

40:49.117 --> 40:51.390
It was a good idea.

40:52.127 --> 40:54.788
Although, I'm not so sure
she would've come

40:54.812 --> 40:57.271
if she knew you were behind it.

41:00.836 --> 41:02.837
Well, whatever it takes.

41:07.508 --> 41:10.009
You never told her what you know.

41:16.123 --> 41:18.124
No, I did not.

41:24.192 --> 41:26.527
I better get back in there.

41:28.915 --> 41:32.161
Frank, maybe you should
heed your own advice

41:32.186 --> 41:34.398
and avail yourself of one of our programs

41:34.423 --> 41:36.757
to share what's weighing on you.

41:39.474 --> 41:42.319
I got my own program for that, Walter.

41:42.343 --> 41:44.311
Oh, yeah? What's that?

41:45.807 --> 41:47.974
My family's dinner table.

41:48.305 --> 41:54.297
