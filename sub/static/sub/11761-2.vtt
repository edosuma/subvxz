<i>Camelot...</i>

00:02.895 --> 00:04.610
You're not welcome, Morgan.

00:04.645 --> 00:07.925
Father, I learned more
than you can imagine.

00:08.235 --> 00:10.625
Uther! Somebody help him!

00:10.660 --> 00:12.050
<i>Merlin!</i>

00:12.085 --> 00:14.675
<i>The King is dead. Murdered.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:15.995
What's that got to do with us?

00:16.030 --> 00:18.770
You... are Uther's son.

00:18.805 --> 00:20.900
I'm Uther's
daughter and sole heir.

00:20.935 --> 00:26.365
If we forge a union, we'd have
the strength to unite the realm.

00:26.505 --> 00:29.355
Who is she? Who is she?

00:29.390 --> 00:30.620
I don't know!

00:30.655 --> 00:33.575
I am the true and legitimate
heir to Uther's throne.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.555
And you will show me respect!

00:35.590 --> 00:37.685
No!

00:37.935 --> 00:42.375
But if you don't leave,
there will be more slaughter.

02:16.076 --> 02:20.111
O Lord, grant eternal
rest, and let everlasting

02:20.132 --> 02:23.234
light shine upon your
servant here and deliver

02:23.302 --> 02:26.270
her from eternal death in
that awful day, when the

02:26.338 --> 02:30.441
heavens and the earth
shall be shaken and thou

02:30.509 --> 02:34.746
shalt come to judge
the world by fire. Amen.

02:34.813 --> 02:36.781
Amen.

02:39.485 --> 02:41.319
Wait.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.456
It's my fault.

02:45.524 --> 02:46.524
No.

02:46.592 --> 02:47.625
But it is.

02:47.693 --> 02:48.826
Don't
let it rule you.

02:48.894 --> 02:51.062
Lot murdered her so
you would buckle.

02:51.130 --> 02:56.667
Take what you're feeling
and use it as fuel.

02:56.735 --> 02:58.269
We'll make this right.

02:58.337 --> 03:01.305
But you can't be distracted;
there's too much at stake.

03:01.373 --> 03:04.409
We need to return
to Camelot now.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.779
No.

03:07.846 --> 03:10.381
No!

03:15.187 --> 03:20.892
I want to
stay with her-on my own.

03:22.895 --> 03:25.897
I'm giving you an order.
Plan my defences.

03:25.964 --> 03:29.434
I'll return
before sundown.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.569
Now leave me to
make my peace.

03:56.595 --> 03:58.830
How many have
you killed with this?

03:58.897 --> 04:03.935
You think I keep count?

04:05.204 --> 04:08.473
You're thinking
about the boy again, aren't you?

04:08.540 --> 04:11.175
I thought he
understood my warning.

04:11.243 --> 04:12.810
You gave him a chance.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.947
You were fair.
Don't brood.

04:16.014 --> 04:18.548
She was his mother.

04:18.617 --> 04:20.918
He has a
spare, doesn't he?

04:22.988 --> 04:25.690
Do you remember
when your parents died?

04:25.757 --> 04:29.794
Yes. I killed them.

04:32.998 --> 04:36.901
Now are we going to mourn
the corpse that gave us

04:36.969 --> 04:42.673
the victory, or celebrate
the strength of our unity.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.379
Soon, the boy will
be gone, and you and

04:48.447 --> 04:51.782
I will have the throne.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.586
We need to move fast.

05:28.654 --> 05:32.056
We now have four dawns
before King Lot will attack.

05:32.124 --> 05:35.493
Strengthen every
aspect of our defences.

05:35.561 --> 05:37.828
More guards at all
exits and entrances.

05:37.896 --> 05:41.966
Challenge anyone
you don't recognize.

05:42.034 --> 05:44.101
Trust no one.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.369
We don't
have enough forces.

05:45.437 --> 05:47.205
Leave that to me.

05:47.272 --> 05:54.545
As of now, you have one
single priority: protect Arthur.

05:54.613 --> 05:56.781
Protect your future king.

06:26.545 --> 06:27.945
What're you doing?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.380
You were
staring at me.

06:29.448 --> 06:32.416
And this is where I go
NOT to be stared at!

06:32.484 --> 06:37.321
I can explain.

06:37.389 --> 06:39.156
Go on then.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.558
I had a dream.

06:40.626 --> 06:43.861
Maybe a vision-of
u-walking out of the sea.

06:43.929 --> 06:45.296
No!

06:45.364 --> 06:47.632
I know what goes on
around these lands now.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.668
And you are not going
to lay a finger on me.

06:50.736 --> 06:51.736
Whatever's
going on round here,

06:51.803 --> 06:55.206
I'm not a part of it, I swear.

06:55.274 --> 06:57.341
I came to get away.

06:57.409 --> 07:02.313
And then you ... appeared.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.483
Get away from what?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.086
I buried my
mother. On the hill above.

07:09.154 --> 07:11.789
She was murdered
yesterday.

07:11.857 --> 07:17.495
You can go see the grave
if you don't believe me.

07:19.865 --> 07:21.165
How did she die?

07:21.233 --> 07:23.034
A warrior
called Lot killed her.

07:23.101 --> 07:24.368
Why did he kill her?

07:24.436 --> 07:27.071
I killed his son.

07:27.139 --> 07:32.843
I see. He'll
come for you next.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.647
My family, my uncles, they
stood up to him once.

07:36.715 --> 07:39.283
He killed them all.
He won't stop.

07:39.351 --> 07:40.651
So I must be
stronger than him.

07:40.719 --> 07:41.852
You can't be.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.424
I have to be.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.297
This dream,
the one I was in.

07:53.365 --> 07:58.769
How did it end?

07:58.837 --> 08:01.806
I can't remember.

08:01.873 --> 08:05.743
<i>Arthur!</i>

08:08.513 --> 08:10.581
It's my father. I
thought they'd killed him too.

08:10.649 --> 08:13.584
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

08:13.652 --> 08:15.920
I'm Arthur.

08:15.987 --> 08:17.288
Good luck, Arthur.

08:17.356 --> 08:18.622
But I don't
know your name.

08:18.690 --> 08:22.960
No. You don't.

08:27.599 --> 08:29.867
Father!

08:32.437 --> 08:34.871
I thought
you were dead.

08:35.941 --> 08:37.975
They came and
they took us both.

08:38.043 --> 08:41.812
I managed to escape. I
let your mother down.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.949
No. I misjudged
what Lot was capable of.

08:45.016 --> 08:47.585
I bear the responsibility.

08:47.652 --> 08:52.089
Then you help us.
Help us avenge her death.

08:52.157 --> 08:59.130
Now we'll
fight-not by blood, by guile.

08:59.197 --> 09:03.100
Follow me and she won't
have died in vain.

10:44.669 --> 10:47.671
Where are you?

10:59.351 --> 11:04.088
Uther is dead.
But there's another.

11:04.155 --> 11:07.625
Uther's boy.

11:13.732 --> 11:15.799
It makes no difference.

11:15.867 --> 11:20.070
He has nothing now.
His mother was killed.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.340
His spirit is broken.

11:31.016 --> 11:35.452
It's nearly the time.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.021
I swear.

11:38.456 --> 11:39.557
You've a
big task today.

11:39.624 --> 11:40.758
You say
that every day.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.860
This is
your biggest.

11:42.928 --> 11:44.061
D'you know what
he's talking about?

11:44.129 --> 11:46.697
Nope. He said
you'd need me.

11:46.765 --> 11:48.098
But then, you
always need me!

11:48.166 --> 11:49.533
I don't think so.

11:49.601 --> 11:52.603
A king exists
primarily as an idea.

11:52.671 --> 11:57.174
We persuade the people to
believe in the idea of you,

11:57.242 --> 11:59.243
we can make
it a reality.

11:59.311 --> 12:00.878
Leontes will join us.

12:00.946 --> 12:03.514
He has the equipment
you'll need.

12:03.582 --> 12:04.949
What equipment?
What're you talking about?

12:05.016 --> 12:07.418
Yeah, how do
I become a new idea?

12:07.485 --> 12:10.621
By doing
the impossible.

12:16.294 --> 12:17.461
The Romans
believed that sword

12:17.529 --> 12:20.698
belonged to Mars,
their God of war.

12:20.765 --> 12:22.366
We all know
the legend, thank you.

12:22.434 --> 12:23.867
We were told
it as children.

12:23.935 --> 12:25.436
I didn't believe
it then, either.

12:25.503 --> 12:26.770
How long has it
really been there?

12:26.838 --> 12:29.406
Nobody knows
exactly how long.

12:29.474 --> 12:32.710
Today, you'll retrieve it.

12:32.777 --> 12:35.279
Good luck
with that, Brother.

12:35.347 --> 12:36.880
No way.

12:36.948 --> 12:38.849
Anyone who's
tried it has died.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.819
- The legend's
- whoever pulls the

12:41.886 --> 12:43.887
sword from that rock
shall be the King to

12:43.955 --> 12:45.756
unite all of Briton.

12:45.824 --> 12:47.224
It's been
there for centuries.

12:47.292 --> 12:49.226
No one's ever done it
before; what makes you

12:49.294 --> 12:50.894
think I can do it?

12:50.962 --> 12:52.529
Because no one's
ever needed to do it,

12:52.597 --> 12:55.399
as much as you do.

12:55.467 --> 12:59.536
This is your moment.
Believe in yourself.

13:01.439 --> 13:02.506
Maybe with
some training-

13:02.574 --> 13:04.041
No! It
has to be now.

13:04.109 --> 13:05.576
If it's so important,
why don't you do it?

13:05.644 --> 13:08.212
Stop pulling at me
and start pushing yourself!

13:08.279 --> 13:10.114
You've strength
and intelligence.

13:10.181 --> 13:14.551
But if you won't try,
you're not my king.

13:14.619 --> 13:19.356
And everything will
have been for nothing.

13:23.528 --> 13:25.229
I have an idea.

13:38.543 --> 13:40.210
Where were you?

13:40.278 --> 13:42.212
I woke and you
weren't beside me.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.181
I like to
walk in the mornings.

13:44.249 --> 13:47.685
Move your
arse, ya trout.

13:47.752 --> 13:49.019
Walk where?

13:49.087 --> 13:51.522
The woods.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.858
The word has spread.

13:54.926 --> 13:58.195
We've made our mark.
They're sending gifts.

13:58.263 --> 13:59.563
Send them back.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.366
It's too early for gifts.
Nothing's been won.

14:02.434 --> 14:04.368
Ah come, come, it's
never too early for gifts.

14:04.436 --> 14:08.272
They understand who'll be
in charge of the realm.

14:08.339 --> 14:09.873
They want to show respect.

14:09.941 --> 14:12.843
We'll deserve it
when the boy is gone.

14:12.911 --> 14:14.445
The boy
was seen riding out of

14:14.512 --> 14:16.280
Camelot this morning.

14:16.347 --> 14:18.148
They're scurrying away.

14:18.216 --> 14:20.384
And you
know that for sure?

14:20.452 --> 14:23.020
I know what
fear does to people.

14:23.088 --> 14:25.255
We will drive all those
that remain from the

14:25.323 --> 14:27.725
ruins of Camelot.

14:27.792 --> 14:29.793
Then we will celebrate
our wedding and make

14:29.861 --> 14:32.863
preparations for
our coronation.

14:32.931 --> 14:39.236
Oh, come on, you've got
to admit, it's exciting.

14:39.304 --> 14:42.773
I'd be excited if
you were planning battles,

14:42.841 --> 14:47.211
instead of
ceremonies-my Lord.

14:49.581 --> 14:53.317
My father stayed King because
he never became complacent.

14:53.384 --> 14:58.355
I hope I won't have cause
to doubt our alliance.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.334
Ready?

15:10.401 --> 15:12.436
Stronger together.

15:27.619 --> 15:29.019
I'm looking for
my sons, Kay and Arthur.

15:29.087 --> 15:30.954
Have you seen them?

15:32.757 --> 15:35.392
You're Ector?

15:35.460 --> 15:38.462
And you're
his mother.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.731
I gave
birth to him.

15:40.799 --> 15:43.000
But your wife was
more his mother.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.170
I'm so sorry
for her death.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.139
Thank you.

15:49.207 --> 15:51.809
We always wondered
what you looked like.

15:51.876 --> 15:54.545
How much of
you was in him.

15:54.612 --> 15:56.513
We used to talk about what
might happen if you came

15:56.581 --> 15:58.282
to claim him.

15:58.349 --> 16:00.317
But you never came.

16:00.385 --> 16:03.520
I couldn't. I was
forbidden to search for him.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.621
Or speak of him.

16:04.689 --> 16:05.956
<i>A rider approaches...</i>

16:06.024 --> 16:07.724
Of course.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.160
<i>Open the gates!</i>

16:10.228 --> 16:11.662
What's going on?

16:11.729 --> 16:14.598
Someone's trying
to pull the sword of Mars.

16:14.666 --> 16:15.999
Arthur.

16:19.604 --> 16:23.440
It's working! It's working!

16:25.877 --> 16:27.444
Come on, up more!

16:27.512 --> 16:31.315
That's cheating.

16:31.382 --> 16:34.918
It's initiative.

16:39.657 --> 16:42.326
Yes! Come on!

16:44.996 --> 16:47.898
Prepare the beacon.

16:47.966 --> 16:51.101
Waste of wood.
He'll not get that sword.

16:51.169 --> 16:53.070
Piss off.

17:00.278 --> 17:01.712
Come on!

17:06.818 --> 17:09.419
We did it!

17:26.404 --> 17:27.503
I thought you
said our priority was to

17:27.571 --> 17:29.206
protect the King.

17:29.274 --> 17:30.407
I've been on those rocks.

17:30.475 --> 17:31.942
You're sending
him to his death.

17:32.010 --> 17:32.943
Even if he gets
to the sword, it's

17:33.011 --> 17:34.678
impossible-can't be done.

17:34.746 --> 17:39.883
It can.
It must. We've nothing.

18:03.908 --> 18:04.942
You're wasting
your time, lads.

18:05.009 --> 18:08.245
He'll never make it.

18:08.313 --> 18:10.147
He'll make it.

18:10.214 --> 18:14.017
They've come to
watch a legend born.

18:20.692 --> 18:24.261
<i>Don't stop Arthur!</i>
<i>Don't stop!</i>

19:46.544 --> 19:48.712
<i>Concentrate,</i>
<i>Arthur.</i>

19:48.780 --> 19:52.883
Strength and intelligence-

19:55.953 --> 20:01.591
<i>Now stop pulling at me</i>
<i>and start pushing yourself!</i>

20:15.406 --> 20:17.441
Yes!

20:53.811 --> 20:56.446
Arthur!

21:05.123 --> 21:07.491
Arthur?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.893
Is he breathing?

21:09.961 --> 21:13.130
You did it, my boy.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.435
He did it!

21:22.573 --> 21:26.743
Send the signal. Light the
beacon. Tell everyone.

21:26.811 --> 21:30.180
The new king has come.

21:35.786 --> 21:38.088
It can't be true.

21:38.156 --> 21:39.923
If he has the
sword of the Gods,

21:39.991 --> 21:41.258
people will fight for him.

21:41.325 --> 21:42.592
You think
I don't know that?

21:42.660 --> 21:44.561
That's why he
rode out this morning.

21:44.629 --> 21:48.598
You underestimated
him, you lazy cunt!

21:50.401 --> 21:54.070
Don't you
talk to me like that!

21:54.138 --> 21:58.008
We have an alliance and my
allies don't speak to me

21:58.075 --> 22:01.211
in that way.

22:02.947 --> 22:08.084
Now, if you
were a man, I'd kill you.

22:08.152 --> 22:11.821
I'm just going to teach
you a lesson instead.

22:11.889 --> 22:14.524
You're right.
Show them how you control me.

22:14.592 --> 22:17.460
Here, however you want. Do it.

22:17.528 --> 22:19.296
Assert your supremacy.

22:19.363 --> 22:22.899
They need to see
you're strong. Do it!

22:22.967 --> 22:24.768
Come on! I'm
ready. Do it!

22:33.477 --> 22:36.012
No.
I've got a better idea.

22:51.095 --> 22:52.429
You all
need to rest.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.697
We're not leaving him.

22:53.764 --> 22:58.034
You're no
good to him exhausted.

23:01.038 --> 23:03.306
We'll take turns to sit
with him through the night.

23:03.374 --> 23:10.447
If he worsens, whoever's
on duty can wake the others.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.883
Do something!
You have powers!

23:13.951 --> 23:15.785
Fix this!

23:15.853 --> 23:18.755
No.

23:18.823 --> 23:23.593
Then
what use are you?

23:36.941 --> 23:39.676
You're
a clever bitch.

23:39.744 --> 23:41.611
But you can't
play me, woman.

23:41.679 --> 23:42.979
Release me!

23:43.047 --> 23:44.681
You brought
me into your castle.

23:44.749 --> 23:47.050
You thought you could control
me, for your own ends,

23:47.118 --> 23:48.551
but you were wrong.

23:48.619 --> 23:49.786
We should be
focusing on Uther's bastard!

23:49.854 --> 23:52.956
Ah, shh, shh.

23:53.991 --> 23:58.094
You need to think about
the nature of our alliance.

23:58.162 --> 24:03.166
And where the
true power lies.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.634
Don't do this.

24:04.702 --> 24:07.504
I'll talk
to you in the morning.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.207
Unless the wolves
get you first.

24:24.655 --> 24:30.427
You've had a terrible
loss and nothing can...

24:30.494 --> 24:34.064
heal that.

24:34.131 --> 24:37.267
And I could be useful.

24:37.335 --> 24:41.738
I know that we are strangers,
but I could help you.

24:41.806 --> 24:48.778
I know how a castle is run, and
I know how a king should live.

24:49.847 --> 24:53.683
I can do that for you.

24:53.751 --> 25:01.558
Please, please let me
atone for my mistakes.

25:22.079 --> 25:25.115
I searched for you.

25:25.182 --> 25:27.717
You didn't come.

25:27.785 --> 25:31.821
<i>He is wrong.</i>

25:31.889 --> 25:34.157
Who is?

25:34.225 --> 25:44.801
<i>He is wrong. He is wrong.</i>

25:45.703 --> 25:48.772
He's no worse.
That's something.

25:48.839 --> 25:54.778
You should rest.
I'll watch till dawn.

25:54.845 --> 25:58.348
I won't have any more
death in my family, Merlin.

25:58.416 --> 26:00.283
He did this so
your wife's death would

26:00.351 --> 26:01.651
serve the cause.

26:01.719 --> 26:03.486
I don't care
about your cause!

26:03.554 --> 26:07.957
My son's life far
outweighs any plan that

26:08.025 --> 26:10.360
you might have.

26:33.584 --> 26:36.019
Hello.

26:36.086 --> 26:39.556
You had a fall.

26:42.359 --> 26:44.360
Did I do it?

26:44.428 --> 26:49.265
Do what?

26:52.903 --> 26:56.840
You did it!

26:56.907 --> 27:01.144
You were extraordinary!

27:35.012 --> 27:39.516
Do we understand
each other now?

27:39.583 --> 27:42.118
Yes.

27:42.186 --> 27:44.320
Good girl.

27:54.498 --> 27:57.300
The boy has the
sword of the gods and the

27:57.368 --> 28:00.270
word is that people
rally to him.

28:00.337 --> 28:02.639
I've given him five dawns.

28:02.706 --> 28:05.008
He thought he
could outwit me.

28:05.075 --> 28:07.076
My patience is done.

28:07.144 --> 28:11.981
I... no, we...

28:12.049 --> 28:14.651
we attack today.

28:14.718 --> 28:16.486
Come on.

28:16.554 --> 28:20.557
If you're lucky, I'll let you
ride on the back of my horse.

28:28.632 --> 28:29.699
Careful.

28:29.767 --> 28:31.167
Oh no.

28:35.439 --> 28:37.574
How did I do it, when
so many others had failed?

28:37.641 --> 28:40.343
This is what
you were born for.

28:40.411 --> 28:44.814
Uther's bloodline,
Ector's education.

28:44.882 --> 28:46.349
You used your knowledge.

28:46.417 --> 28:48.918
Only you have that.

28:48.986 --> 28:55.091
You're right.
I did it. Me.

28:55.159 --> 28:58.628
On my own.

28:58.696 --> 29:01.631
Nearly on my own.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.266
Something you said.

29:03.334 --> 29:07.270
About pushing,
not pulling.

29:07.338 --> 29:13.009
But how could you
know- unless-

29:13.077 --> 29:15.945
you put the sword there.

29:16.013 --> 29:17.113
You created a legend
knowing that, one day,

29:17.181 --> 29:18.648
someone would conquer it.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.985
Eyes round.

29:25.923 --> 29:29.325
That sword's been
there hundreds of years.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.161
Nobody knows
exactly how long.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.097
Except you.

29:34.164 --> 29:36.232
You've had
a bump on the head.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.067
Oh, thank God.

29:39.336 --> 29:40.770
Oh, shut up.

29:40.838 --> 29:42.038
If you want to be a king,
you've gotta learn to take

29:42.106 --> 29:43.539
a few knocks.

29:43.607 --> 29:44.574
Hate it to say it,
but you didn't need me.

29:44.642 --> 29:47.944
For once.

29:50.381 --> 29:51.814
Thank you.

29:51.882 --> 29:54.250
Your
servant, my Lord.

29:56.854 --> 29:59.422
Now.
They're waiting.

29:59.490 --> 30:02.992
Who are?

30:13.804 --> 30:16.339
They saw what
you did, from afar.

30:32.489 --> 30:35.625
In the
beginning was the word.

30:35.693 --> 30:40.096
And the word spread.
And the people came.

30:40.164 --> 30:45.501
Now we'll crown you,
in front of them.

30:45.569 --> 30:48.304
You want
to crown me now?

30:48.372 --> 30:50.339
They'll be your forces.

30:50.407 --> 30:53.376
Take your place as King.

30:55.946 --> 30:57.814
What does she want?

30:57.881 --> 31:00.183
I'll take care of her.

31:07.224 --> 31:09.158
What're you, the decoy?

31:09.226 --> 31:10.760
I came to warn you.

31:10.828 --> 31:12.729
Lot knows about the sword.
You don't have another dawn.

31:12.796 --> 31:14.063
He's coming.

31:14.131 --> 31:17.533
Why tell me this?

31:17.601 --> 31:18.701
Morgan!

31:24.141 --> 31:26.642
Good luck.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.646
Pass the word around.

31:30.714 --> 31:33.649
King Lot is on his way.
Everything must be prepared.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.718
Now we know when; we
just don't know how.

31:35.786 --> 31:39.555
Nothing must stop
this coronation.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.693
Arthur, make
me your champion.

31:43.761 --> 31:46.662
Make me your champion, and
I will find Lot and avenge

31:46.730 --> 31:48.698
the death of your mother.

31:48.766 --> 31:50.800
For our family
and country.

31:50.868 --> 31:54.003
It's Merlin!
With the sword!

32:02.980 --> 32:07.550
Today, we pledge
our allegiance to the

32:07.618 --> 32:09.986
King of all Britons;

32:10.053 --> 32:14.290
the one who removed
the sword of the gods.

32:20.664 --> 32:28.704
I present to you,
your undoubted King.

32:49.059 --> 32:50.459
Will you
solemnly swear to rule the

32:50.527 --> 32:53.029
peoples of this realm
according to their laws

32:53.096 --> 32:57.266
and customs and cause law
and justice, in mercy, to

32:57.334 --> 33:00.937
be executed in all
your judgments?

33:01.004 --> 33:02.338
I will.

33:02.406 --> 33:03.673
Will you
maintain the laws of God

33:03.740 --> 33:05.675
and the true profession
of the Gospel?

33:05.742 --> 33:07.410
I will.

33:07.477 --> 33:10.046
With this
crown, I anoint you

33:10.113 --> 33:13.382
King of the Britons.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.152
Arise, King Arthur.

33:27.731 --> 33:30.233
When I hear
of kings, I think of

33:30.300 --> 33:35.004
warriors, coming to the
throne through slaughter.

33:35.072 --> 33:37.340
I am not that person.

33:37.407 --> 33:41.410
But I have known loss at
the hands of those men.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.646
I'm something new.

33:43.714 --> 33:47.049
Standing here before
you, I realize that.

33:47.117 --> 33:50.219
I know I carry
your hope in me.

33:50.287 --> 33:53.155
And I will establish,
here at Camelot,

33:53.223 --> 33:55.791
a new way of ruling,
for you, the people!

34:02.766 --> 34:06.002
Everything I
am, I owe to my family.

34:06.069 --> 34:09.938
Not just my bloodline,
but those who raised me.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.009
And a country is nothing
if not a family.

34:13.076 --> 34:19.215
So, I call upon my father and
my brother to join me here!

34:24.254 --> 34:25.288
Without my
brother's guidance,

34:25.355 --> 34:27.889
I wouldn't be the man I am.

34:27.958 --> 34:31.092
I demand he apply his
stewardship to all the realm.

34:31.161 --> 34:34.397
My brother, Kay-
Marshal of England!

34:41.772 --> 34:44.507
And every king
needs his champions.

34:44.574 --> 34:50.079
And on my coronation, I
choose my father, Ector.

34:50.147 --> 34:53.516
There is no greater man.

34:53.583 --> 34:59.288
And also Leontes, to
whom I owe my life.

34:59.356 --> 35:03.960
This is not
my country. It is ours.

35:04.027 --> 35:08.664
I am Arthur Pendragon and
I am proud to be your King.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.605
Hello.

35:49.673 --> 35:51.340
Hello.

35:51.408 --> 35:54.377
So, what
is your name?

35:54.444 --> 35:55.778
It's Guinevere.

35:55.846 --> 35:57.113
Arthur.

35:57.180 --> 36:01.217
Yes. I know.

36:01.284 --> 36:04.487
Let's find a
quieter place to talk.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.257
I didn't think
I'd see you again.

36:08.325 --> 36:10.826
From what I hear,
you're lucky to be alive.

36:10.894 --> 36:13.329
That was pretty
reckless-

36:13.397 --> 36:15.531
and very brave.

36:15.599 --> 36:18.000
Thank you.

36:18.068 --> 36:19.568
I like
what you said.

36:19.636 --> 36:22.605
I never expected a King
to say those things.

36:22.672 --> 36:25.041
Is that
a good thing?

36:25.108 --> 36:28.844
To me it is.
What was it like up there?

36:28.912 --> 36:30.646
All those people?

36:30.714 --> 36:36.552
Like, for only the
second time in my life,

36:36.620 --> 36:38.854
I was standing in the right
place at the right time.

36:38.922 --> 36:41.223
When
was the first?

36:41.291 --> 36:43.993
On a beach with
someone I'd just met.

36:49.633 --> 36:52.902
You can see the
beach from the ramparts.

36:52.969 --> 36:55.237
Come on, I'll show you.

37:17.294 --> 37:20.863
You took him
from me, 20 years ago.

37:20.931 --> 37:22.798
And yet you look no older.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.368
Your memory
is playing tricks.

37:26.436 --> 37:33.175
No. That night
is branded on my soul.

37:33.243 --> 37:37.813
You have not aged one
day. How is that possible?

37:37.881 --> 37:42.118
It's not.

37:52.429 --> 37:56.465
It
is beautiful.

37:56.533 --> 38:02.238
What are
you thinking about?

38:04.040 --> 38:05.407
The future.

38:05.475 --> 38:09.011
What about it?

38:09.079 --> 38:10.112
Don't you
worry that all this

38:10.180 --> 38:12.081
responsibility
will change you?

38:12.149 --> 38:13.315
Close you down?

38:13.383 --> 38:17.720
I didn't until
you just said it.

38:19.723 --> 38:24.727
Do you think you'd
die if you jumped off here?

38:24.794 --> 38:28.664
No. I'm living proof.

38:28.732 --> 38:33.469
It's a lot
higher. Are you sure?

38:35.872 --> 38:38.474
As long as you
avoid those rocks.

38:38.542 --> 38:40.075
And that stump.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.544
Of course you wouldn't
want to hit that stump.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.612
How deep do you
think that sea is down there?

38:43.680 --> 38:47.850
Do you
want to find out?

39:02.365 --> 39:08.170
If you do, I will.

39:08.238 --> 39:15.578
Ready? One-

39:15.645 --> 39:18.280
Two, three.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.251
Are you all right?

39:22.319 --> 39:23.519
I knew you weren't
going to do it.

39:23.587 --> 39:25.120
I
would if you had.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.089
It is
madness down there.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.657
It is
madness up here.

39:28.725 --> 39:31.460
Leontes, have you
met Guinevere?

39:31.528 --> 39:32.962
No.

39:33.029 --> 39:37.466
Guinevere, this
is the amazing Leontes.

39:37.534 --> 39:40.469
Actually, we've known
each other a very long time.

39:40.537 --> 39:43.205
We've been friends
since childhood.

39:43.273 --> 39:47.209
This is my betrothed.

39:47.277 --> 39:49.845
I am.

39:51.147 --> 39:54.149
That's wonderful.
Congratulations!

39:54.217 --> 40:01.490
Thank you. I was
just looking for her.

40:03.627 --> 40:08.764
You're very lucky.
A lucky couple.

40:08.832 --> 40:10.599
This man saved my life.

40:10.667 --> 40:16.405
Yes,
he does that.

40:16.473 --> 40:19.475
Well then. I should
get back to the madness.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.543
Enjoy.

41:06.222 --> 41:07.589
They're already here!

41:12.829 --> 41:16.699
Kay!
Protect the King!

41:21.204 --> 41:24.139
This way! Go, go, go!

41:54.137 --> 41:55.938
Stand strong men!

42:04.414 --> 42:09.718
Get him
out of here!

42:19.996 --> 42:22.264
Out of my way
and you live-

42:22.332 --> 42:23.999
You don't know who
I am, do you?

42:24.067 --> 42:26.802
I don't
care who you are.

42:26.870 --> 42:33.308
I'm the man
whose wife you killed.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.477
And?

42:35.545 --> 42:37.679
Tell me her name.

42:37.747 --> 42:39.114
What?

42:39.182 --> 42:44.653
The name of the
woman you slaughtered.

42:44.721 --> 42:48.123
The only thing
matters is she died.

42:48.191 --> 42:53.028
She spent her last
hours on her knees.

43:19.055 --> 43:23.358
Enough!

43:26.930 --> 43:30.599
And now you're
going to join her.

44:13.076 --> 44:15.410
<i>Father!</i>

44:21.818 --> 44:24.853
Father!

44:24.921 --> 44:31.760
Oh no, no, no no...no...
father...

44:34.797 --> 44:36.632
Drag his body
into the courtyard.

44:36.699 --> 44:41.203
Make sure everyone knows
King Lot has been vanquished.

44:43.740 --> 44:50.479
My sons. I love you.

45:50.239 --> 45:54.543
I tried an
alliance with a man.

45:54.611 --> 45:58.080
But he was wrong.

45:58.147 --> 46:03.785
Men are not my
way to this.

46:03.853 --> 46:08.290
I'll find another
way to take it.

46:13.229 --> 46:17.399
Why do you
need to take it at all?

46:17.467 --> 46:22.437
I'm placing your castle under
my protection from now on.

46:22.505 --> 46:27.309
In gratitude for
your warning.

46:27.377 --> 46:31.580
don't need
to be opposed.

46:31.648 --> 46:36.151
We can work together.

46:36.219 --> 46:38.687
It's either you
or me. It can't be both.

46:38.755 --> 46:40.389
Why not?

46:40.456 --> 46:42.791
For you,
this is nothing.

46:42.859 --> 46:46.628
For me, everything.

46:53.202 --> 46:57.005
What did you
see in the night?

46:57.073 --> 47:04.079
I know what it is. Do you?
Don't go near it.

47:04.147 --> 47:06.648
Don't have anything
to do with it!

47:29.372 --> 47:31.273
Where
are you?

47:46.956 --> 47:49.191
I need more.

48:01.003 --> 48:05.340
Tell me
what I have to do.
