12:07.814 --> 12:10.294
GOT HIM.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.166
WHAT'S WITH THE MARK
ON HIS FOREHEAD?

12:12.209 --> 12:13.602
RUNNING FACIAL REC.
RIGHT NOW.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.257
DON'T BOTHER.
IT'S VICTOR ZSASZ.

12:16.300 --> 12:20.087
HE'S A HITMAN.
HE LOGS HIS KILLS
WITH HASH MARKS.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.784
HOW ARE YOU
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS

12:21.828 --> 12:23.960
WITH A PROLIFIC
HIRED ASSASSIN?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.791
BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE
WHO KNOW HIM.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.185
WHAT? WE KIND OF RUN
IN THE SAME CIRCLES.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.969
LUKE: RUN IN THE--
MARY: RAN

12:33.013 --> 12:34.492
IN THE SAME CIRCLES, OK?

12:34.536 --> 12:38.932
PAST TENSE
AND VERY LARGE,
WIDE CIRCLES,

12:38.975 --> 12:41.282
WHICH HAS NOW JUST
COME IN HANDY

12:41.325 --> 12:43.458
BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW
WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.416
MY P.O. IS
AT THE HOLD-UP
LOOKING FOR ME.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.548
I GOT TO GO.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.376
WHAT ABOUT ZSASZ?

12:48.419 --> 12:50.421
I'LL DEAL WITH HIM
WHEN YOU FIND
HIS ADDRESS.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.380
HIS SCARS ARE WORKS
OF ART.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.862
HE SHIPS IN SOME
HIGH-END FRENCH
SKIN CARE LOTION.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.081
NAME TRANSLATES
LIKE A BABY'S BUTT
OR SOMETHING.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.084
OH! LES FESSES DE BEÉBE!

13:01.128 --> 13:04.609
WHAT? IT'S REALLY
GOOD STUFF.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.176
YEAH. YOU TWO, GO--

13:06.220 --> 13:09.179
TRACK THE BABY'S BUTT.
YEAH. I GOT IT.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.702
OK.

13:22.671 --> 13:23.890
[DEVICE BEEPING]

13:29.896 --> 13:32.463
ONE LAST MEAL
BEFORE THE SLAUGHTER?

13:37.338 --> 13:41.342
I HAD YOU DRUGGED,
KIDNAPPED, AND SHIPPED
TO MY DOORSTEP.

13:41.385 --> 13:45.955
THIS IS MY WAY OF SAYING
NO HARD FEELINGS.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.739
COME.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.220
SIT WITH ME.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.701
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU,

13:52.744 --> 13:56.487
I PREFER MY POISON
IN PILL FORM.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.054
YOU THINK I'D GO
TO THE TROUBLE

13:58.098 --> 13:59.795
OF BRINGING YOU
ALL THE WAY HERE

13:59.839 --> 14:01.666
JUST TO POISON YOU?

14:01.710 --> 14:05.583
YEAH, SO YOU COULD
HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT.

14:05.627 --> 14:09.849
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
STARTED THIS FIGHT, ALICE.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.634
WHAT IS THE
APPROPRIATE REACTION

14:12.677 --> 14:14.201
TO LEARNING
MY SISTER'S PLANE

14:14.244 --> 14:15.637
WAS BLOWN OUT
OF THE SKY?

14:15.680 --> 14:18.770
YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK,

14:18.814 --> 14:20.903
EXPOSED MY ISLAND'S
MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE

14:20.947 --> 14:23.645
TO EVERY OPPORTUNIST
IN GOTHAM.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.519
WELL, A WISE WOMAN
ONCE TAUGHT ME

14:28.563 --> 14:31.174
IT'S NOT WORTH SENDING
A MESSAGE

14:31.218 --> 14:32.959
UNLESS IT'S LOUD.

14:40.618 --> 14:44.492
YOU ALWAYS WERE
MY BEST STUDENT,

14:44.535 --> 14:48.278
BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE BEEN MISINFORMED.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.020
I DIDN'T BLOW UP
YOUR SISTER'S PLANE.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.022
SOMEONE WANTS YOU TO THINK
I KILLED KATE

14:53.066 --> 14:55.895
WHEN THE TRUTH IS
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT HER OR YOU

14:55.938 --> 14:59.333
SINCE YOU LEFT THIS ISLAND
5 YEARS AGO,

14:59.376 --> 15:04.338
WHICH MEANS THE TWO OF US
HAVE A PUZZLE TO SOLVE,

15:04.381 --> 15:09.430
SO SIT, MY FRIEND,
AND JOIN ME
FOR A GLASS

15:09.473 --> 15:11.214
LIKE OLD TIMES.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.915
RYAN: SURE YOU GOT
THE RIGHT ADDRESS?

15:15.958 --> 15:19.483
BECAUSE WHAT KIND
OF STONE-COLD KILLER SHOPS

15:19.527 --> 15:20.963
AT STORAGE & STUFF?

15:21.007 --> 15:23.835
AN ACTUAL PSYCHOPATH.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.185
FOUND THE DRIVE.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.839
NICE.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.537
ZSASZ: YOU MUST BE
THE NEW GIRL.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.150
DID YOU FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

15:34.194 --> 15:35.543
B-BATARANG?

15:35.586 --> 15:36.892
SOMEBODY USED
THEM ALL.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.111
THEY RUN OUT?

15:38.154 --> 15:39.851
USE THE BO STAFF.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.505
WHILE WE'RE ALL
WAITING FOR
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN,

15:41.549 --> 15:43.159
CAN I MAKE YOU
A DRINK?

15:43.203 --> 15:46.293
LUKE: THERE'S A BUTTON
HIDDEN ON THE SIDE.

15:46.336 --> 15:49.252
SO I TAKE IT YOU'RE
THE REPLACEMENT.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.732
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OLD ONE?

15:50.775 --> 15:52.429
SHE GET KILLED,

15:52.473 --> 15:54.605
OR ARE YOU LIKE
SAMMY HAGAR

15:54.649 --> 15:56.520
TO HER DAVID LEE ROTH?

15:56.564 --> 16:00.220
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
WONDERING WHICH
OLD WHITE GUY I AM?

16:00.263 --> 16:03.614
UGH. KIDS TODAY.
NO SENSE OF HISTORY.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.313
YEAH. NOT GONNA SWEAT
SOME FREAK WHO USES

16:06.356 --> 16:08.968
HIS SKIN
AS A KNIFE SHARPENER.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.840
WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S MY SKIN

16:11.883 --> 16:15.061
BECAUSE--AND I'M ONLY
BEING HONEST--

16:15.104 --> 16:18.151
YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY COMFORTABLE
IN YOURS.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.630
IT'S LIKE...

16:19.674 --> 16:23.156
TRYING TO PASS
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.288
I DIDN'T DESIGN
THE DAMN SUIT.

16:25.332 --> 16:29.379
HEH. I CAN TELL

16:29.423 --> 16:33.166
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE
THE BATWOMAN IN YOU,

16:33.209 --> 16:36.169
AND MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE

16:36.212 --> 16:40.086
THE YOU IN BATWOMAN.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.913
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I SEE?

16:41.957 --> 16:45.004
IS IT A SHOULDER-FIRED
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.701
OH, HELL, NO!

16:59.888 --> 17:02.064
I DOVE OUT
OF A FLAMING BUILDING

17:02.108 --> 17:03.631
JUST FOR A LIST
OF NAMES?

17:03.674 --> 17:05.328
MARY:
JUST A PROLIFIC HITMAN

17:05.372 --> 17:08.070
WITH A LONG LIST
OF NAMES.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.898
ANYONE ELSE HAVE
A PIT IN THEIR STOMACH?

17:09.941 --> 17:12.857
LET'S FIGURE OUT
WHO THEY ARE FIRST.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.556
JANET EVANS IS...

17:15.599 --> 17:18.428
A NINTH GRADE
BIOLOGY TEACHER.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.692
PAUL AKINS...PLUMBER.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.304
JAMAL WALKER...
STOCK BROKER.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.523
I--I DON'T GET THIS.
I'M NOT SEEING
A CONNECTION.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.396
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
PROTECT ALL THESE PEOPLE.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.054
WHAT IF WE
DON'T HAVE TO?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.795
ZSASZ DOESN'T
FIND WORK,
WORK FINDS HIM,

17:37.839 --> 17:41.973
MEANING SOMEONE
HIRED HIM TO GET
THIS LIST.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.367
WE FIGURE OUT
WHO HE WORKS FOR,

17:44.411 --> 17:46.195
AND WE STOP THEM.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.892
-BUT HOW?
-I ASK HIM.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.851
BECAUSE HE REALLY OPENED UP
TO YOU THE LAST TIME.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.245
NOT AS BATWOMAN.
AS RYAN.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.247
ARE YOU INSANE?
WHY WOULD A HITMAN

17:54.290 --> 17:56.162
RAT OUT HIS EMPLOYER?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.819
BUT HE DOES KNOW
WHO YOU ARE

18:01.863 --> 18:04.866
OR AT LEAST OF YOU
PERIPHERALLY,

18:04.909 --> 18:06.781
SO IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.348
OR YOU BECOME
A TALLY MARK

18:08.391 --> 18:09.827
OVER HIS
RIGHT EYEBROW.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.787
OR I FIND OUT
WHO HIRED HIM.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.963
YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE,
RIGHT?

18:15.006 --> 18:16.747
HOW MUCH OF THAT
IS LIQUID?

18:32.285 --> 18:34.809
PLENTY OF OPEN SEATS
ELSEWHERE.

18:34.852 --> 18:38.029
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.597
I DATED
ANGELIQUE MARTIN.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.730
YOU'RE ANGELIQUE'S EX?

18:42.773 --> 18:44.601
HEH HEH HEH.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.473
THEN BY ALL MEANS,

18:46.516 --> 18:48.605
STAY AND DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.782
JUST DON'T DO TO ME
WHAT YOU DID TO HER.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.219
SO YOU DO KNOW ME.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.221
I KNOW YOU BROKE
HER HEART.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.744
APOLOGIES IF I'M
OVERSTEPPING.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.181
I'M JUST A SUCKER
FOR LESBIAN DRAMA.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.836
HEH HEH. SHE WAS
BAD FOR ME.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.577
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
IT'S LOVE.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.321
WORD ON THE STREET

19:08.364 --> 19:11.454
YOUR LAST JOB
WENT SIDEWAYS.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.500
THAT MEAN YOU'RE
AVAILABLE FOR HIRE?

19:26.904 --> 19:28.515
YOU WANT ME TO KILL
YOUR EX?

19:28.558 --> 19:31.953
I WANT YOU TO TAKE OUT
ALICE.

19:31.996 --> 19:35.522
HER WONDERLAND GANG
KILLED MY MOM.

19:35.565 --> 19:38.655
SIDEWAYS DOESN'T MEAN
MY JOB'S OVER.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.483
SO WHOSE PRICE DO I
NEED TO BEAT?

19:40.527 --> 19:41.745
HEH.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.749
I DON'T KILL
AND TELL.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.461
LUKE, DID I GET THE SNIFFER
CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIS PHONE?

20:01.504 --> 20:04.028
LUKE: YEP. VACUUMED UP
ALL HIS DATA

20:04.072 --> 20:06.117
ALONG WITH 3 LAYERS
OF ENCRYPTION.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.946
STAND BY WHILE I
BURROW THROUGH HIS
MOST RECENT CONTACTS,

20:08.990 --> 20:10.818
AND...

20:10.861 --> 20:13.516
THE MYSTERY CLIENT IS...

20:15.344 --> 20:17.825
SAFIYAH.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.567
I KNOW YOU WANT ME
TO BE A BAD PERSON,

20:20.610 --> 20:22.482
BUT I'M NOT.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.875
I DIDN'T KILL
YOUR SISTER.

20:24.919 --> 20:28.052
LAST THING I'D EVER
DO IS DRAW ATTENTION
TO MY ISLAND.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.924
THEN WHY DO I HAVE A NOTE
SIGNED BY YOU

20:29.967 --> 20:32.579
SAYING OTHERWISE?

20:32.622 --> 20:35.277
OH, THEN BY ALL MEANS,
YOU GOT ME ALICE.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.931
MY NAME WAS ON A NOTE.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.933
THEN WHO BLEW IT UP?

20:38.976 --> 20:41.457
CLEARLY SOMEONE WHO
THOUGHT YOU STILL
MATTER TO ME.

20:43.546 --> 20:47.942
LAST YEAR, I WORKED
WITH ONE OF YOUR MEN,
THE RIFLE.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.033
TRADED A WEAPON DESIGNED
TO KILL BATWOMAN

20:52.076 --> 20:56.690
IN EXCHANGE FOR A VIAL
OF YOUR DESERT ROSE SERUM.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.953
ONLY I RENEGED ON MY END,

20:58.996 --> 21:02.086
HANDED OVER
A BROKEN PIECE
OF TECHNOLOGY.

21:03.697 --> 21:07.918
GO ON. I'M DYING
TO KNOW HOW THIS ENDS.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.921
YOU KILLED MY ENTIRE GANG
IN RETALIATION.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.575
YOU HAVE A GANG?

21:14.055 --> 21:16.492
-HAD.
-KILLING LACKEYS.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.928
SOUNDS TEDIOUS.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.365
OR THOROUGH.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.410
IF I WAS BEING
THOROUGH,

21:21.454 --> 21:23.847
WHY ARE YOU
STANDING HERE?

21:32.378 --> 21:34.728
[SIGHS]

21:34.771 --> 21:37.078
SO WHY IS ALICE
STILL ALIVE?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.344
SAFIYAH PRIDES
HERSELF

21:42.388 --> 21:45.913
ON BEING A FAIR
AND JUST RULER.

21:45.956 --> 21:49.569
SAFIYAH TOOK HER IN,
GROOMED HER TO BE
A SOLDIER,

21:49.612 --> 21:51.701
AND PROMISED HER
AN ETERNITY

21:51.745 --> 21:54.051
OF PROTECTION
AND HEALTH.

21:54.095 --> 21:55.531
BUT ALICE HAD HER HEART
SET ON DESTROYING

21:55.575 --> 21:58.360
THE KANE FAMILY BACK
IN GOTHAM.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.319
SO LET ME GUESS.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.711
ALICE BETRAYED HER?

22:03.844 --> 22:08.501
ALICE BROKE
THE CARDINAL RULE
OF THE ISLAND.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.635
SHE TRIED TO LEAVE
AND TAKE

22:12.679 --> 22:15.334
A DESERT ROSE FLOWER
WITH HER.

22:17.771 --> 22:21.731
SAFIYAH: I'VE FORGIVEN
YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO...

22:23.646 --> 22:25.779
WHICH IS WHY IT'S GOING
TO BE MUCH HARDER

22:25.822 --> 22:27.520
FORGIVING YOU FOR THIS.

22:28.912 --> 22:32.351
YOU EXPOSED THE SECRET
OF THE DESERT ROSE
TO THE WORLD.

22:35.571 --> 22:39.358
CORYANA IS THE GARDEN,
AND I AM ITS KEEPER.

22:39.401 --> 22:43.013
MY FAMILY HAS DEDICATED
LIFETIMES TO PROTECTING
ITS SECRET.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.407
HISTORY IS LITTERED
WITH COLONIZERS

22:45.451 --> 22:47.235
WHO COME WITH THEIR
FALSE IDEALS

22:47.278 --> 22:49.368
AND PILLAGE FOR THEIR
OWN PROFIT--

22:49.411 --> 22:53.372
THE AFRICAN DIAMOND TRADE,
OIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.287
CORYANA IS NO DIFFERENT.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.202
OUR GARDEN WILL BE
RAVAGED,

22:58.246 --> 23:02.119
AND OUR PEACEFUL ISLAND
WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.121
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

23:04.165 --> 23:06.559
BEFORE YOU BLEW UP
MY SISTER'S JET.

23:06.602 --> 23:09.170
I DIDN'T BRING DOWN
HER JET.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.563
AND I DIDN'T EXPOSE
THE SECRET

23:10.606 --> 23:13.566
OF THE DESERT ROSE
TO THE WORLD.

23:13.609 --> 23:16.656
I GAVE IT TO JUST
ONE PERSON,

23:16.699 --> 23:19.572
AND SHE DID THE REST.

23:19.615 --> 23:23.314
AND WHO IS
THIS PERSON?

23:23.358 --> 23:25.447
SAFIYAH. I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF HER.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.623
IT'S ONE OF HER
MANY ALIASES.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.146
THE ONLY SAFIYAH WE
HAVE IN OUR DATABASE

23:29.190 --> 23:30.670
HAS HALF A DOZEN
EUROPEAN PASSPORTS

23:30.713 --> 23:31.888
WITH JUST AS MANY
NAMES--

23:31.932 --> 23:33.934
NASAR, SOHAIL, PATEL...

23:33.977 --> 23:35.457
OK. SO HOW DO
WE FIND HER?

23:35.501 --> 23:37.328
WELL, IF SHE'S
EXTREMELY SHADY,

23:37.372 --> 23:41.028
ODDS ARE RYAN'S ALREADY
IN A BOOK CLUB WITH HER.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.986
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH HER?

23:43.030 --> 23:44.901
I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH RYAN.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.124
THEN WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH ME?

23:54.955 --> 23:56.696
THIS IS NOT
A PERMANENT GIG.

A SECRET IDENTITY.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.238

38:48.282 --> 38:49.762

39:21.968 --> 39:23.622
FOR BEING SO HARD

39:25.450 --> 39:27.669

MAJOR ASS YESTERDAY.

39:30.803 --> 39:35.373
I GET IT.

39:35.416 --> 39:38.027

JEWISH HONOR FOR THE DEAD.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.586
I'M NOT READY
TO SAY IT YET.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.286
I NOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
KEPT HOW I FEEL FROM YOU.

40:19.329 --> 40:22.768
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT IT IS
HOW I FEEL.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.596
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
HOW I FEEL.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.875
WHAT'S HIS MASK MADE
OF--WOOD?

40:42.918 --> 40:44.833
COMMANDER SAYS TO
GO AFTER THE HEAD
OF THE SNAKE.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.574
ACCORDING TO MY C.I.,
THAT GUY IS

40:46.618 --> 40:48.489
AT THE TOP OF
THE FALSE FACE
SOCIETY.

MY CALLS,

41:27.485 --> 41:28.964
I HAD THE TECH TEAM
ON ALL NIGHT

41:29.008 --> 41:31.227
TRYING TO OVERRIDE
THE PASSWORD.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.707

41:34.840 --> 41:37.277
KATE WAS DOING LOOKING
INTO A PAINTING

41:37.320 --> 41:40.149
