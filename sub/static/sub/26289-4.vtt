00:02.654 --> 00:03.612
It's time to take a stand
withThe Gifted.

00:03.655 --> 00:06.310
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.354 --> 00:08.095
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.271
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.314 --> 00:11.750
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.794 --> 00:13.143
andLethal Weapon.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.972
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.236
Anyone can stand up to an enemy.
I need people who are

00:19.280 --> 00:21.282
strong enough
to stand up to their friends.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.286
Any of you ever heard
the name "Reeva Payge"?

00:25.329 --> 00:26.939
She had taken over
the Inner Circle.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.637
-So help us stop her.
-There is a mutant.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.899
Goes by Erg.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.292
Nothing happens in town
he doesn't know about.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.554
-And he'll help?
-He might.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.469
I talked to Erg.
He said that the Frosts

00:34.512 --> 00:35.992
were tapping into a data cable

00:36.036 --> 00:37.907
under the Health Department.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.475
-What's going on?
-I've been getting the headaches
since Andy left.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.259
I don't know what's happening.
When I touch things,

00:42.303 --> 00:44.696
they've been crumbling.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.959
You could have come to me.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.483
This is different.
It had to be mutants.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.572
-There's no other explanation.
-Jace, I am begging you.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.314
-You have to move on.
-I made some calls.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.142
Sentinel Services, they
gave me the rundown on you.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.969
Frivolous reports about dead...

00:57.013 --> 00:59.363
They're not dead!
I just saw them.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.670
Mr. Turner, it's time
for you to go home.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.367
It was weird.
Didn't feel like a dream.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.890
CAITLIN:
You saw Andy?

01:04.934 --> 01:07.806
-LAUREN:
He looked older, different.
-Lauren!

01:08.851 --> 01:10.113
Andy, get back!

01:12.376 --> 01:14.770
[yelling]

01:18.252 --> 01:20.384
WOMAN:
Mr. and Mrs. Strucker,

01:20.428 --> 01:22.604
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

01:22.647 --> 01:25.215
The prognosis is worse
than we expected.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.350
Okay, so...

01:29.393 --> 01:31.700
what's the treatment?
What are our options?

01:31.743 --> 01:34.268
Your liver function is already
seriously affected.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.400
And I'm afraid
we don't have many options

01:36.444 --> 01:38.272
besides... termination.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.361
Oh, God.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.579
But she's five months pregnant.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.190
There must be something.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.408
I'm sorry, Mr. Strucker.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.193
At 20 weeks,
the baby isn't viable.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.412
And carrying it to term
is very risky.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.284
No, this... this is crazy.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.764
I know it's difficult,
but you have to understand.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.289
The pain you're experiencing
will get worse.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.987
There could be severe bleeding,
seizures.

01:58.030 --> 02:01.208
[crying]: But there, there ha--
there has to be a chance.

02:01.251 --> 02:05.168
A successful pregnancy
is technically possible.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
Yeah.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.390
But there's a much greater
chance of death for you,

02:09.433 --> 02:12.393
your baby or both of you.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.004
[Caitlin's breath quivers]

02:16.658 --> 02:19.182
[sniffles, sighs]

02:21.010 --> 02:23.012
-[Caitlin sniffles]
-[sighs]

02:23.055 --> 02:26.450
Honey... I am so sorry.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.670
Reed, I'm not gonna do it.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.194
-But you heard the doctor.
-Yes, I did.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.762
And I'm not gonna
lose this baby.

02:33.805 --> 02:36.982
You have
to consider your health.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.681
And Lauren...

02:39.724 --> 02:42.771
we-we don't have
to decide this right now.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.991
[quietly]:
I have already decided.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.472
I am not giving up on our son.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.692
He's gonna make it,

02:50.735 --> 02:52.694
and he is gonna be amazing.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.262
Just like our daughter.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.397
All right.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.921
All right, then.

03:10.407 --> 03:13.149
LAUREN:
That was delicious.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.107
It's been an eventful week.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.413
I thought
I'd make something special.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.460
Or at least
burn something special.

03:19.503 --> 03:23.377
Lauren, your mom and I
have been talking,

03:23.420 --> 03:27.468
and I'm gonna discuss
my powers with John,

03:27.511 --> 03:30.166
see if I can figure this out.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.516
We want you to know
we're also thinking about you.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.344
You don't need to.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.911
I'm fine.

03:35.954 --> 03:39.480
Hey, you don't have to be fine.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.699
I realized,
I have been so focused

03:41.743 --> 03:43.135
on getting your brother back...

03:43.179 --> 03:44.485
REED:
We never considered what

03:44.528 --> 03:46.661
finding Andy might mean to you.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.490
CAITLIN: Your dad told me
about what you said.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.535
The reality of what
you can do together...

03:51.579 --> 03:54.669
REED:
My situation with my powers has

03:54.712 --> 03:57.149
opened my eyes to...

03:57.193 --> 03:59.413
how terrifying it is for you.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.546
CAITLIN:
What we're trying to say is

04:02.590 --> 04:04.461
we're sorry, honey.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.073
I'm sorry, too.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.512
All this time,
I've been so... scared

04:11.555 --> 04:14.428
of what happened,
of the dreams,

04:14.471 --> 04:16.778
what I thought they meant.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.693
But I think I was wrong
about them.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.129
How do you mean?

04:20.172 --> 04:22.436
I think
the dreams are telling me

04:22.479 --> 04:26.266
I need to be the one
that brings Andy home.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.799
ECLIPSE:
You guys need to understand

04:37.842 --> 04:39.975
what we're up against here.
It's not just

04:40.018 --> 04:42.456
the Frosts.
This woman Reeva, she's...

04:42.499 --> 04:44.458
she's powerful.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.547
I mean, she's got a hold
on Andy and Lorna

04:46.590 --> 04:48.723
that's greater than anything
I thought possible.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.551
Andy's 15. She's probably
giving him whatever he wants.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.682
Of course he's caught up
in this...

04:51.726 --> 04:54.511
Caitlin, I saw him.
I talked to him.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.384
I'm telling you,
he's a believer.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.387
And with Lorna, she, uh...

05:00.430 --> 05:03.346
She looked me in the eye,
and she told me she loved me,

05:03.390 --> 05:05.609
and that whatever
they're doing matters more.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.961
Then we need
to find out what that is.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.964
How? We've been
following them for six months,

05:13.008 --> 05:15.750
and all we know is they're
well-hidden and well-funded.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.491
Well, we also know that

05:17.534 --> 05:18.796
they like destroying stuff
and killing people.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.363
But we can't just sit
on our hands

05:20.407 --> 05:22.583
waiting for them to make a move.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.411
She's right.
We know they were hacking

05:24.454 --> 05:26.630
into data cables.
Maybe we can go to Wire.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.850
See if he can-- I don't know--
hack the system,

05:28.893 --> 05:31.287
-find out for us.
-He nearly killed you
and my mom.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.071
BLINK: Yeah. I mean, last time
I checked, he hates you.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.073
You really think
he's gonna cooperate?

05:35.117 --> 05:39.077
Well, if he doesn't, we'll have
to find a way to make him.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.384
Okay, that's dark.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.300
If anyone has a better idea,

05:44.344 --> 05:47.129
I'd love to hear it.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.966
REED:
Hey, John?

05:58.009 --> 05:59.489
Can I have a word?

06:01.143 --> 06:03.493
What's going on?

06:03.537 --> 06:05.103
I need your help with something.

06:05.147 --> 06:08.890
You know
my father's experiments?

06:08.933 --> 06:11.196
When he tried to suppress
the effects of the X-Gene in me?

06:11.240 --> 06:13.460
Yes.

06:13.503 --> 06:16.463
It seems that
he wasn't entirely successful.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.639
What?

06:18.682 --> 06:20.641
You're manifesting powers?

06:20.684 --> 06:23.687
When I've been touching things.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.820
They've been
beginning to crumble

06:25.863 --> 06:27.996
and fall apart, and when
it happens, it's destructive.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.519
I-I have no control.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.216
Okay, well,
it's not unusual to feel like...

06:31.260 --> 06:34.481
Believe me,
it doesn't feelusual.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.221
I don't know if it's related
to what my dad did,

06:36.265 --> 06:37.701
but the headaches,
the way the power accelerates...

06:37.745 --> 06:39.529
Yeah, you need,
you need training.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.488
But I don't have time for that.
I just need it to stop.

06:41.531 --> 06:44.708
You can't, all right? Your-your
powers-- they're a part of you.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.710
They're linked
to your deepest emotions.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.495
Well, then
if I could control them...

06:48.538 --> 06:50.714
No, no. I've seen people try,
all right?

06:50.758 --> 06:52.716
Anxiety medications,
tranquilizers--

06:52.760 --> 06:54.457
it's gonna work
for a little while,

06:54.501 --> 06:55.458
-but you're always...
-That's all I need.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.852
I just need some time
until everything calms down.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.898
You don't want to go down
that road, okay? Trust me.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.596
You need training.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.119
-If this is happening...
-John!

07:04.162 --> 07:05.555
We're ready. Let's go.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.688
You go. You go.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.167
We can, we can talk
about it another time.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.778
It's good.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.653
[groans]

07:31.712 --> 07:33.714
[Blink sighs]

07:35.716 --> 07:38.109
I hated this idea even before
I saw the neighborhood.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.502
This place is sketchy.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.417
-Ah, you didn't have to come.
-Uh-uh.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.375
If you guys are planning
on doing something this stupid,

07:43.419 --> 07:44.986
someone's got to be there
if something goes wrong.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.770
The sooner we get this done,
sooner we're out of here.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.424
Look, I might not be
Wire's favorite person,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.121
but he's a businessman.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.210
A businessman who threatened
to sell you to our enemies.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.212
It wasn't pretty,
but we got what we needed.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.345
Chances are he whines a little,
then he takes the cash.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.086
-That's it.
-And if he doesn't?

07:58.129 --> 08:00.218
Then maybe one
of his hacker buddies might.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.785
They have a whole little nest
in there.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.395
They smoke Kick all day,

08:03.439 --> 08:04.571
they hack into systems
and steal stuff.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.311
Sounds delightful.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.400
Yeah, well,
it's the best chance we have

08:08.444 --> 08:09.793
of saving Lorna and Andy.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.447
Who you said
don't want to be saved.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.884
They have my daughter.

08:13.928 --> 08:18.367
Clarice, it's a long shot,
but it's all we've got.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.725
-[door rattling]
-Come on!

08:33.991 --> 08:35.776
Oh, well. Nice try, guys.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.342
Let's grab a latte
on the way back.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.996
-What do you say?
-Hold up. Hey.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.049
Someone's in there.

08:48.092 --> 08:51.661
Yo! Wire, it's me. It's Marcos.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.445
-[gunshots]
-[groaning]

08:53.489 --> 08:55.578
-Oh, God. John!
-[Thunderbird yells]

08:55.622 --> 08:57.841
Stay back!
[groans]

08:57.885 --> 08:59.756
[grunts]

09:00.975 --> 09:03.107
Just a businessman, huh?!

09:04.195 --> 09:06.502
-No, no, no, no.
-Hey, stop.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.417
We just want to talk.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.854
[groans]

09:10.898 --> 09:13.030
-[grunting]
-Die!

09:13.074 --> 09:15.163
What the hell's
the matter with you?

09:15.206 --> 09:18.035
Hey, hey, put the gun down,
all right? We just want

09:18.079 --> 09:20.037
-to talk to you.
-You got my brother killed.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.866
Talk to this, bitch.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.607
[groaning]

09:24.651 --> 09:26.087
-Aah.
-[groans]

09:27.828 --> 09:30.439
Oh!

09:30.482 --> 09:31.875
Are you okay?

09:31.919 --> 09:33.094
You're the one that got shot.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.617
Oh, I'm fine.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.401
BLINK:
Who the hell is this guy?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.229
-That's Wire's brother.
-Hey, hey.

09:38.273 --> 09:39.622
We got to get out of here
right now.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.885
Yeah, we needed a hacker.
He'll have to do.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.757
Let's go.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.803
-[groaning]
-[siren wailing]

10:00.817 --> 10:03.254
[sighs]

10:22.491 --> 10:24.754
[sighs]

10:38.986 --> 10:40.727
[phone vibrating]

10:47.385 --> 10:49.561
Hello?

10:49.605 --> 10:50.954
MAN:
Is this Jace Turner?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.564
Yeah. Who's this?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.175
Officer Ted Wilson
from the seven-oh-nine.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.872
You came to the precinct?

10:55.916 --> 10:57.831
Yeah. Man, look, I talked to
the sergeant. He made it clear.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.963
I get it. I'll stay away
from the station. Thank you.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.138
Yeah, that's not why
I'm calling.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.837
Okay. Why are you calling?

11:03.880 --> 11:06.317
I, uh...

11:06.361 --> 11:09.364
I heard some of what you said to
the sergeant. I'd like to talk.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.887
What do you want to talk about?

11:10.931 --> 11:13.237
WILSON: Better to explain
in person. It's, um....

11:15.326 --> 11:17.067
It's about the mutant situation.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.940
I think you'll find
we got lots to discuss.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.898
There's a diner nearby,
Melissa's.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.857
Can you meet there at 1:00?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.641
Uh... 1:00?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.861
Yeah. I think
I can make that work.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.384
Good.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.125
I should go.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.953
I'll see you there.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.788
[Thunderbird clears throat,
gasps softly]

11:41.831 --> 11:44.355
The less you squirm,
the faster this goes.

11:45.574 --> 11:46.967
Okay.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.578
-Got it.
-BLINK: Weird.
-Okay.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.188
I thought you were
indestructible.

11:51.232 --> 11:55.671
No. Shotgun at point-blank range
still hurts.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.761
That's what you get for
listening to Marcos's bad ideas.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.763
We don't know if it was
a bad idea yet.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.808
-Maybe the hacker's helping.
-Oh, yeah.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.374
He seemed real eager to please.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.811
Let him try.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.116
Try what?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.162
We've already tried kidnapping.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.904
Have we graduated to torture?

12:10.947 --> 12:12.862
We went to a lot of trouble

12:12.906 --> 12:14.908
to get the information
about the data cables.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.953
Going to see Evangeline.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.390
[sniffs]
You talking to Erg.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.048
Fine. I just...

12:25.092 --> 12:29.096
I don't want anyone who's
not bulletproof getting hurt.

12:31.402 --> 12:35.102
-Wake up.
-[groaning]

12:37.887 --> 12:40.672
-What the hell?
-I'm glad you enjoyed your nap.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.196
We've got a lot to talk about.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.980
Are you eating paint chips?
Do you think

12:44.024 --> 12:45.155
I'm just gonna chat with you?

12:45.199 --> 12:47.027
Yeah, you shot my friend
with a shotgun.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.029
-Three times.
-What the hell
do you expect, man?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.813
My brother just got iced.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.163
Slow down.
What's your name?

12:53.207 --> 12:55.078
It's Graph.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.384
What happened to Wire, huh?

12:56.427 --> 12:57.602
What happened?

12:57.646 --> 12:58.865
I'll tell you what happened.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.389
Three hot triplets
walked into the store.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.740
Wire looks 'em up and down,
then out of nowhere,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.002
he puts a nine-millimeter
in his mouth

13:06.046 --> 13:08.265
-and pulls the trigger.
-And you saw them?

13:08.309 --> 13:11.051
No. Wire came back
from the dead to tell me.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.531
I hacked the security cams.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.317
So your abilities, they're...

13:16.360 --> 13:17.971
they're like
your brother's were, then?

13:18.014 --> 13:19.929
I can break any door
at the code level.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.062
REED:
We need your help.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.672
We can pay.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.500
You think I'm an idiot?

13:25.543 --> 13:28.720
I know what my brother
was doing for you guys.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.332
This chick Reeva Payge,
runs the Inner Circle,

13:31.375 --> 13:32.899
she didn't just come after Wire.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.946
Check this out.
I want to show you something.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.783
This is what she does
to her friends.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.698
Bunch of the old
Hellfire Club folks

13:49.741 --> 13:51.091
got killed, spread around D.C.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.049
Some kind of hostile takeover.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.572
She's got this little project,

13:54.616 --> 13:56.270
and she'll kill anyone
who gets in her way.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.880
So I'm not gonna get in her way.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.143
I don't need my own visit
from the suicide girls.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.884
Please. She took our son.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.668
[mock crying]:
Oh, no.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.235
Your son?

14:05.279 --> 14:06.933
Well, that's awful.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.935
Except I don't care!
As far as I'm concerned,

14:08.978 --> 14:11.111
she can eat your son!

14:11.154 --> 14:14.070
You want to get rough,
we can get rough.

14:14.114 --> 14:17.465
You gonna hit me with another
one of those flashbulbs?

14:17.508 --> 14:19.380
No, but I can melt your eye
out of your skull.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.381
How about that?

14:20.424 --> 14:22.296
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

14:22.339 --> 14:25.908
And how am I supposed to hack
without eyes, genius?!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.137
How's it going?

14:37.180 --> 14:39.182
He has no intention
of helping us.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.401
So it's over?

14:40.444 --> 14:42.707
No. We tried asking nicely.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.710
-Now we'll try something else.
-Like what?

14:45.754 --> 14:47.147
Graph's an addict,
like his brother.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.714
In the ER, I saw addicts
stab themselves

14:49.758 --> 14:51.107
for a scrip of oxycodone.

14:51.151 --> 14:54.981
Past a certain point, a junkie
will do anything for a fix.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.025
Mom.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.593
What are you gonna do?

14:58.636 --> 15:01.988
It's our family, Lauren.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.077
I'll do what I have to.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.605
All right, all right,
how about this?

15:10.648 --> 15:13.173
You let me go, I won't tell
these Inner Circle psychos

15:13.216 --> 15:14.652
that you're after them.

15:14.696 --> 15:15.653
If you want to
get out of here,

15:15.697 --> 15:16.872
you're gonna have to
deal with us.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.354
Actually, you're gonna
have to deal with me.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.444
Are you familiar
with Hypertrexone?

15:25.881 --> 15:28.101
When Kick addicts come in
with an O.D.,

15:28.144 --> 15:30.190
we give them this.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.147
It counteracts the drug,

15:31.191 --> 15:33.019
and it brings them down
in seconds.

15:33.062 --> 15:36.544
The addicts hate it because

15:36.587 --> 15:39.068
they go into immediate
withdrawal.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.419
Can you hold him down?

15:42.463 --> 15:43.420
GRAPH:
Come on.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.856
No.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.684
Get away from me
with that thing.

15:46.728 --> 15:47.685
-Get away!
-All right...

15:47.729 --> 15:50.558
No, please. Please, no.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.081
[groans]

15:52.125 --> 15:53.691
[straining]

15:53.735 --> 15:56.868
[gasping]:
I can't breathe.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.435
I can't breathe.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.046
[gasping]

16:00.089 --> 16:04.180
Help me find my son!

16:04.224 --> 16:06.139
[cries out]

16:11.971 --> 16:13.363
[Graph screaming]

16:13.407 --> 16:17.106
BLINK:
Wait, Graph's actually helping?

16:17.150 --> 16:19.804
Uh, Caitlin was, uh...

16:19.848 --> 16:21.067
persuasive.

16:22.503 --> 16:25.288
He, uh... he told us
the Inner Circle

16:25.332 --> 16:27.595
were looking at
a mental facility in Bethesda.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.727
You talking about Lynwood?

16:29.771 --> 16:31.164
You know it?

16:31.207 --> 16:34.384
It's more prison than hospital.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.430
They declare mutants
mentally unstable

16:36.473 --> 16:38.519
-and detain 'em without trial.
-How is that legal?

16:38.562 --> 16:40.042
You just get a shrink to say

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
that they're a danger
to themselves or society.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.176
That's all they need.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.699
When she was young,
a judge put Lorna

16:44.742 --> 16:46.222
into one of those hellholes.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.268
She had nightmares
about it for years.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.183
We don't even know what
they're doing in there.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.098
It's something damn important
if you're gonna convince Lorna

16:52.141 --> 16:53.664
to set foot
in a place like that.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.362
[Graph cries out]

16:58.321 --> 16:59.975
Guess we'll find out
soon enough.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.065
I gave you what you wanted.
Now, please, I'm sick.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.111
We need you to find out
what they're doing.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.764
How am I supposed to do that?

17:06.808 --> 17:09.202
We just need you to access
the hospital's network.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.291
Look at me, man.
I have the shakes.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.901
You gonna let her do this to me?

17:12.944 --> 17:14.511
I didn't do this to you.
You did it to yourself.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.252
I didn't put the Kick pipe
in your mouth.

17:16.296 --> 17:19.212
Oh, please spare me the personal
responsibility debate, okay.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.170
I'm about to throw up
on myself here.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.432
You want it to end?
Then find out

17:22.476 --> 17:24.695
what they're doing
at Lynwood Hospital.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.144
I can get into
the hospital's system,

17:38.187 --> 17:40.537
but I can't promise I can find
anything on your friends.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.588
REED:
What are we looking at here?

17:47.631 --> 17:49.764
It's a bunch of crap.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.200
They got terabytes of data

17:51.244 --> 17:52.375
on what time people
took their pills,

17:52.419 --> 17:54.334
and how many carrots
they had for dinner.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.945
-I can't find what you want.
-Then look harder.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.382
Look, I can't find something
that's not there, okay?!

17:59.426 --> 18:01.167
Look, I don't know
if Reeva is looking for

18:01.210 --> 18:02.690
somebody else to try and murder,

18:02.733 --> 18:06.781
or maybe she realized
they need psychiatric help or...

18:08.174 --> 18:09.566
Whoa.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.352
Whoa? What's whoa?

18:12.395 --> 18:15.137
Somebody built a backdoor
to the hospital SCADA system.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.486
Did a nice job, too.

18:16.530 --> 18:19.576
All comm systems are down.
Nothing in or out.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.274
When? When did this happen?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.927
GRAPH:
Uh, it looks like

18:22.971 --> 18:26.148
it went into emergency mode
12 minutes ago.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.323
12 minutes? Then...

18:27.367 --> 18:30.109
Whatever they're doing,
it's happening right now.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.547
REED:
They disabled communications.

18:33.590 --> 18:36.376
That's all we know so far.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.333
Graph's gonna get into
their security system.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.769
We'll let you know
if he finds something.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.510
Do we have a plan? I mean,

18:40.554 --> 18:42.382
other than just driving up to
the hospital/prison thing

18:42.425 --> 18:43.383
and knocking on the door?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.211
This is the best lead we've had

18:45.254 --> 18:47.300
in the last six months;
I'm not letting it

18:47.343 --> 18:48.475
slip through our fingers.

18:50.390 --> 18:54.220
Mom, Dad... Andy's there.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.005
We don't know who he's with.
It could be dangerous.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.224
-They can handle it.
-Andy and I are connected.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.183
If anyone can get through
to him, it's me.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.011
[truck engine starts]

19:04.447 --> 19:06.188
We got to move.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.452
Go.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.151
Bring your brother back safe.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.964
[line ringing]

19:46.533 --> 19:49.710
PAULA [on phone]:
You have to stop calling, Jace.

19:49.753 --> 19:53.366
Baby, you're upset.
I totally get it, okay.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.672
Just hear me out. I got
a meeting with this-this cop.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.457
I'm making progress.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.459
I just need you to bear with me
for a little bit longer.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.810
PAULA:
Jace, stop.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.681
We can't just give up, Paula.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.379
It's not about giving up.

20:06.422 --> 20:10.121
It's about moving on.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.601
JACE: That's exactly why
I need to see this through,

20:11.645 --> 20:12.646
so I can move on.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.256
So I can be
the husband you deserve.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.475
PAULA:
All I need

20:15.518 --> 20:20.044
is a husband who's with me.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.742
A husband who is really with me.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.440
I will be, Paula.
You know that I will be.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.313
When the job is done,
I promise I will be.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.228
Jace...

20:32.187 --> 20:35.146
...the job will never be done.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.105
Don't...

20:37.148 --> 20:39.499
I mean, you act like
I'm doing this for myself.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.761
You think I'm doing this
for myself?

20:40.804 --> 20:42.328
[sighs]

20:42.371 --> 20:44.547
I'm doing this for Grace.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.419
And for every other little kid
just like her.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.334
PAULA [voice breaking]:
Grace is gone.

20:48.377 --> 20:53.513
I love her, and I always will...

20:53.556 --> 20:55.689
but I have to start
living again.

20:55.732 --> 20:59.910
Paula. Paula...

20:59.954 --> 21:02.435
-Stop calling.
-Don't say that.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.306
