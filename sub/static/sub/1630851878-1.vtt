00:34.801 --> 00:38.029
(Chimera)

00:48.743 --> 00:51.342
A mythical creature
with the face of a lion,

00:52.283 --> 00:54.483
the body of a goat, and
the tail of a snake.

00:57.222 --> 01:00.423
A monster that breathes out
fire to kill people, Chimera.

01:06.262 --> 01:08.832
Chimera, a mythical
monster in Greek mythology,

01:09.732 --> 01:11.032
could also mean...

01:11.033 --> 01:13.153
different genetic traits
that lie in the same entity.

01:17.402 --> 01:18.402
Shoot me.

01:22.073 --> 01:23.112
Shoot.

01:25.883 --> 01:26.953
Shoot me!

01:30.523 --> 01:34.292
That moment, what was
he trying to say to me?

01:36.663 --> 01:38.163
The way he looked at me...

01:39.092 --> 01:40.592
felt warm and sorrowful.

01:43.963 --> 01:45.032
But why?

01:46.232 --> 01:50.243
Why did that murderer's
eyes make my heart throb?

01:54.443 --> 02:01.213
(Episode 1)

02:02.413 --> 02:05.753
(August 2019, Seoul)

02:06.223 --> 02:08.722
(Explosive Ordnance
Disposal Training Ground)

02:08.723 --> 02:10.122
- Hello. - Hey, there.

02:11.292 --> 02:13.792
One second, please.
Excuse me, coming through.

02:14.163 --> 02:15.532
Goodness, coming through.

02:18.103 --> 02:19.172
Hello.

02:21.003 --> 02:23.103
- Keeping up the good work? - Yes, sir.

02:23.603 --> 02:24.943
This experiment is conducted...

02:25.473 --> 02:27.913
to help us implement quick
actions against IED attacks...

02:28.243 --> 02:31.011
and to help improve your
evidence recovery skills.

02:31.012 --> 02:33.053
With the support of the Air Force's EOD,

02:33.353 --> 02:36.082
KCSI's Post Blast Investigation Team...

02:36.083 --> 02:39.022
will reenact a terrorist attack...

02:39.023 --> 02:41.093
that often happens in Southeast Asia.

02:41.492 --> 02:43.163
With us today...

02:43.292 --> 02:47.892
is an FBI anti-terrorism
expert, Agent Eugene Hathaway.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.603
She will oversee the experiment.

03:00.042 --> 03:01.142
IED.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.212
The Improvised Explosive Device...

03:04.683 --> 03:08.253
is an explosive made with chemicals
obtainable in everyday life.

03:09.353 --> 03:13.392
Terrorist attacks using IEDs
are on the rise worldwide.

03:14.353 --> 03:16.163
The beef and blood packs...

03:16.292 --> 03:19.261
were placed to show how far
and in what shape and form...

03:19.262 --> 03:22.832
human tissue and blood are
dispersed by the blast.

03:25.332 --> 03:26.873
The explosive we'll use is ANFO.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.373
It's a mix of ammonium nitrate and diesel.

03:31.142 --> 03:32.642
A typical homemade bomb.

03:33.373 --> 03:35.511
When used in a crime or act of terrorism,

03:35.512 --> 03:39.982
steel balls or steel scraps, nails
are left around the explosive.

03:40.353 --> 03:41.711
Back in 2013, there was...

03:41.712 --> 03:44.823
the Boston Marathon bombing,
which I'm sure you remember.

03:45.253 --> 03:47.052
Many were killed or wounded...

03:47.323 --> 03:50.063
because of the steel balls
inside the pressure cooker.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.163
What about Korea?

03:53.133 --> 03:56.003
Are terrorist attacks a
story from a faraway land?

03:58.232 --> 04:00.133
(KCSI, Police)

04:05.443 --> 04:06.573
Fire in the hole!

04:11.283 --> 04:12.283
(Bomb Disposal Unit)

04:13.383 --> 04:15.082
Counting down! Three, two,

04:15.653 --> 04:16.723
one!

04:32.563 --> 04:35.033
Gosh. That's incredible.

04:35.873 --> 04:38.142
That ANFO thing is powerful.

04:38.373 --> 04:41.042
How amazing. Wow.

04:42.343 --> 04:44.141
(Police)

04:44.142 --> 04:45.482
One day,

04:45.813 --> 04:48.183
that exact thing could happen
in the center of Seoul.

04:48.652 --> 04:52.823
That concludes the experiment with
an Improvised Explosive Device.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.762
Sir.

05:05.402 --> 05:06.673
- You made it. - Yes.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.503
Why is the area taped
out like a checkerboard?

05:10.142 --> 05:12.472
That's the FBI way. One-meter squares.

05:14.142 --> 05:16.042
An American planned it,
so it's American style.

05:16.043 --> 05:18.742
Oh. Is she really FBI?

05:18.743 --> 05:21.581
She's obviously Korean. Is she an expat?

05:21.582 --> 05:23.282
You're way too curious.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.851
Why don't you just join CSI?

05:25.852 --> 05:27.322
Quit Violent Crimes.

05:27.323 --> 05:29.662

05:29.793 --> 05:32.392
Hey, Unit One. Wait!

05:32.592 --> 05:34.363
You punks!

05:36.063 --> 05:37.661
- Darn you. - What was that about?

05:37.662 --> 05:39.972
Do you take me for a fool?

05:40.373 --> 05:42.373
Do you think I don't know this is rigged?

05:42.873 --> 05:45.641
I want my money back.
Give me back my money!

05:45.642 --> 05:48.172
That old man is at it again.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.641
Where are your manners?

05:49.642 --> 05:51.012
You frauds.

05:51.383 --> 05:53.552
Remember your place!

05:53.553 --> 05:55.383
You duped me first!

05:58.152 --> 06:00.552
- My gosh. - He'll take our share too.

06:00.553 --> 06:02.352
You targeted the wrong guy.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.891
- Darn you. - You moron.

06:04.892 --> 06:06.493
- Get lost. - Get out of here.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.331
You ruined the mood again.

06:11.332 --> 06:13.102
I said if you do it once more, you're out.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.372
Don't take it out on me.

06:15.373 --> 06:17.601
The guy with glasses hid a card.

06:17.602 --> 06:19.141
Check your cameras.

06:19.142 --> 06:21.011
Okay, I won't do it again.

06:21.012 --> 06:23.882
Let me off. Let me go just this once.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.912
Let go of me. Let go, punks!

06:50.402 --> 06:53.613
The idiots. They took me for a fool.

06:55.243 --> 06:57.911
Back in the day, with just a pen,

06:57.912 --> 07:00.152
I got to decide who lived and who died.

07:00.912 --> 07:05.222
They've never met an intellectual,
so they'd never recognize one.

07:15.363 --> 07:16.363
What?

07:17.633 --> 07:18.803
What is this?

07:31.443 --> 07:33.983
Darn it. Why won't it go up?

07:35.352 --> 07:38.323
How annoying.

08:46.253 --> 08:48.053
Gosh. What is this mess?

08:54.433 --> 08:55.793
Everything's burned.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.033
- Isn't that a lighter? - My gosh.

09:37.303 --> 09:39.173
- It has a marking. - It's nothing.

09:39.673 --> 09:42.372
Watch your grubby hands.
Where are your gloves?

09:43.882 --> 09:44.882
Hey.

09:52.323 --> 09:53.653
Was the car faulty?

09:54.092 --> 09:55.823
Will there be another mass recall?

09:56.962 --> 09:58.023
Let's see.

09:59.063 --> 10:00.461
I think it's suicide.

10:00.462 --> 10:03.263
With what? There are no
charcoal briquette marks.

10:03.933 --> 10:05.303
Couldn't that have been burned?

10:05.832 --> 10:09.502
A charcoal briquette
leaves a circular mark.

10:10.372 --> 10:12.471
There must've been a butane gas can.

10:12.472 --> 10:14.472
It's obvious he lived in his car.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.813
Does he have no home?

10:18.582 --> 10:20.712
We'll never identify him at this rate.

10:23.683 --> 10:24.823
I don't smell anything?

10:25.452 --> 10:27.591
A smell? What kind of smell?

10:27.592 --> 10:30.362
There must've been a flammable substance.

10:30.962 --> 10:33.992
Whether it's gasoline or
alcohol, there should be a smell.

10:34.763 --> 10:36.243
Doesn't it evaporate with the flames?

10:36.403 --> 10:39.772
Oil fires smell of oil and
gas fires smell of gas.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.773
There's always a trace which is
why fire scenes are so messed up.

10:43.502 --> 10:45.001
Something blew up by accident.

10:45.002 --> 10:46.972
Wrap it up and transfer
it to Transportation.

10:50.313 --> 10:51.342
That's odd.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.683
Why is there no ignition source?

10:55.313 --> 10:56.352
A what?

10:56.482 --> 10:57.522
Ignition source.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.352
The cause or start of the fire.

11:14.332 --> 11:17.472
We have more pressing theft and rape cases.

11:18.102 --> 11:20.842
Jae Hwan, are you sure we have a case here?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.042
That's your problem.

11:25.043 --> 11:28.252
You doubt and suspect every single case.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.981
Like Captain said, there
must've been a butane gas can.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.492
Watch it. Don't cut corners.

11:34.952 --> 11:35.992
It wasn't butane gas.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.892
- What? - What?

11:37.893 --> 11:40.693
Or charcoal briquette,
gasoline, or paint thinner.

11:42.063 --> 11:43.063
What was it, then?

11:43.563 --> 11:44.732
(Fire Evaluation Report)

11:46.832 --> 11:48.472
There was no cause.

11:48.972 --> 11:50.001
What?

11:50.002 --> 11:51.403
The fire had no cause.

11:55.242 --> 11:57.543
(Fire Evaluation Report)

12:04.222 --> 12:06.852
(Violent Crimes 1)

12:09.592 --> 12:12.423
How can there be no cause.
They just couldn't find it.

12:13.862 --> 12:14.933
That could be it.

12:15.163 --> 12:17.362
Cigarette butts burn without a trace.

12:19.232 --> 12:21.173
Can a cigarette butt burn a whole body?

12:21.803 --> 12:22.871
Does that make sense?

12:22.872 --> 12:25.943
If the spark spreads, that is possible.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.472
Inside a car?

12:27.573 --> 12:31.143
The car seats, floor, the
finishing materials for the roof...

12:31.413 --> 12:33.682
Wouldn't all synthetic fabrics burn easily?

12:33.683 --> 12:36.622
You think the fire started
from a cigarette butt?

12:36.982 --> 12:40.222
But he had no idea until his
whole body was up in flames?

12:41.023 --> 12:43.103
He could've fallen asleep
after having a few drinks.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.663
I don't think that's it.

12:45.193 --> 12:46.193
Why?

12:46.563 --> 12:48.362
You can't sleep while driving.

12:48.563 --> 12:50.433
- The car was moving. - Exactly.

12:55.573 --> 12:58.073
Then did the car really explode on its own?

13:13.693 --> 13:16.213
You know how they say something
about falling into a fiery pit?

13:17.163 --> 13:20.393
I heard the most painful way
to die is to be lit on fire.

13:20.793 --> 13:24.303
Who knows? There are various
ways people burn to death.

13:24.732 --> 13:27.273
Isn't that why they
consider fire to be extreme?

13:27.573 --> 13:30.573
Burning something could also
be considered as purification.

13:30.673 --> 13:32.202
It depends on the religion, of course.

13:32.842 --> 13:34.643
Okay. Take a look at this.

13:35.073 --> 13:36.313
Juvenile hematoma.

13:37.643 --> 13:39.683
When a human skull gets overheated,

13:40.212 --> 13:41.482
there is a bleed.

13:41.752 --> 13:43.522
There's no subdural hemorrhage,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.252
and there's no skull damage, so it
didn't happen when he was alive.

13:47.122 --> 13:48.452
What's the cause of death.

13:48.592 --> 13:50.793
He has burns in his airway.

13:51.193 --> 13:52.892
He breathed in...

13:52.893 --> 13:54.461
and inhaled the fire.

13:54.462 --> 13:55.562
Goodness.

13:55.563 --> 13:57.731
Usually, bodies that die in a fire...

13:57.732 --> 13:59.332
present with heat fractures.

13:59.933 --> 14:03.872
Heat fractures are when the bone breaks...

14:04.073 --> 14:05.742
as the body burns.

14:05.903 --> 14:08.173
- The bones? - In that case,

14:08.712 --> 14:11.543
it's hard to tell the difference
between the breaks before death.

14:12.183 --> 14:14.283
But look here.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.852
What is this?

14:22.393 --> 14:24.693
The bone broke and came back together.

14:26.023 --> 14:27.362
Is it not suicide?

14:28.933 --> 14:30.063
Doctor.

14:30.462 --> 14:34.433
Can a person catch on fire all of a sudden?

14:34.673 --> 14:36.903
It's called spontaneous human combustion.

14:37.472 --> 14:40.172
There was a case where someone
suddenly caught on fire and died.

14:40.173 --> 14:41.642
That was in the States.

14:41.643 --> 14:43.963
Is there a rule that says that
this can't happen in Korea?

14:46.183 --> 14:48.913
Did they ever find out the cause of that?

14:50.323 --> 14:53.393
Since it happened in the
States, ask an American.

14:56.622 --> 14:59.293
(Central Police Agency)

14:59.462 --> 15:01.132
(Eugene Hathaway)

15:21.452 --> 15:22.582
Is this...

15:23.823 --> 15:25.722
a real case?

15:26.423 --> 15:27.951
Spontaneous human combustion.

15:27.952 --> 15:30.592
It's a mystery where
humans suddenly ignite.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.332
A mystery? So they don't
know the cause yet?

15:35.832 --> 15:38.101
But the case you brought with you...

15:38.102 --> 15:39.663
presents a bit differently.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.372
This is closer to an explosion.

15:42.673 --> 15:43.702
An explosion?

15:44.342 --> 15:45.842
I'm sorry that I'm not more helpful.

15:48.443 --> 15:52.413
Have you ever seen a case
that's similar to this?

15:52.882 --> 15:54.482
In the States?

15:55.352 --> 15:56.482
I'm not sure.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.581
There was nothing in the car.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.023
No combustible material or ignition source.

16:03.252 --> 16:04.823
Is that possible?

16:05.193 --> 16:07.462
Forensics say that the cause is unknown,

16:08.033 --> 16:11.362
and we've never seen a case
like this, so we're frustrated.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.702
It is strange.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.903
I can't say anything
based on this photograph.

16:23.073 --> 16:24.112
Right.

16:24.582 --> 16:26.712
Can I go to the scene?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.793
You were dispatched here?

16:39.362 --> 16:40.793
How long will you be here?

16:41.163 --> 16:42.232
For a year.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.763
You're very good at Korean.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.872
I knew a lot of Korean
international students.

16:49.202 --> 16:51.173
They even introduced me to Korean dramas.

16:51.773 --> 16:54.242
People would think you lived
in Korea all your life.

16:54.612 --> 16:56.682
If your last name is Hathaway,

16:56.683 --> 16:59.242
is your father American?

16:59.783 --> 17:01.553
Both my parents are American.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.482
I see.

17:12.722 --> 17:14.332
But...

17:14.792 --> 17:17.403
How did you end up in the FBI?

17:19.063 --> 17:21.202
My major was social psychology,

17:21.332 --> 17:24.342
and I saw something interesting
during a lecture on serial killers.

17:25.403 --> 17:26.443
What was it?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.643
The room of a serial murderer
who killed 14 people.

17:31.543 --> 17:33.913
What was so interesting about it?

17:35.752 --> 17:37.323
It looked exactly like my room.

18:12.182 --> 18:14.463
The windows were completely
demolished through the blast.

18:14.953 --> 18:16.293
Okay. Look here.

18:16.592 --> 18:18.762
If there was a car defect,
the engine would explode...

18:18.763 --> 18:20.862
and the fire would spread
from here to there.

18:21.793 --> 18:23.362
But that's not the case here.

18:23.862 --> 18:25.402
Was there really nothing here?

18:29.432 --> 18:30.703
That's impossible.

18:31.073 --> 18:32.941
A fire could start with a small spark,

18:32.942 --> 18:34.342
but an explosion is different.

18:34.942 --> 18:36.983
That means that something
was inside the car.

18:37.682 --> 18:41.253
Are you suggesting that someone
put something in the car?

18:41.513 --> 18:42.582
Probably.

18:43.382 --> 18:44.452
No way.

18:44.453 --> 18:47.293
Why would anyone go through all
that trouble to kill someone?

18:47.692 --> 18:49.752
The person who sets a fire
at the scene of the crime...

18:49.753 --> 18:51.622
has a specific goal in mind.

18:52.463 --> 18:53.533
A goal?

18:53.793 --> 18:55.293
There are two types.

18:55.832 --> 18:58.132
The first is to hide
the scene of the crime,

18:58.432 --> 19:00.512
and the second is to bring
a case out into the open.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.202
I understand why they
would want to hide it,

19:03.203 --> 19:05.363
but why would they want to
bring it out into the open?

19:05.743 --> 19:07.672
They want someone to find the body.

19:08.912 --> 19:09.973
Why?

19:10.382 --> 19:12.341
For example, if they were
after the insurance money,

19:12.342 --> 19:14.512
the body needs to be found
for the death to be confirmed,

19:14.513 --> 19:15.852
and they can get the money.

19:16.352 --> 19:18.351
Or they could set a fire
at a certain time...

19:18.352 --> 19:20.523
to create an alibi.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.523
Regardless, their intentions are clear.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.023
They want you to see it.

19:26.662 --> 19:29.563
Is it like a notice?

19:40.342 --> 19:43.743
Oh, they identified the victim.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.212
His name is Son Wan Ki, 65 years old.

19:49.213 --> 19:51.421
He has been detained a few
times for drunk driving...

19:51.422 --> 19:52.723
and violence while inebriated.

19:54.523 --> 19:55.553
What is it?

19:55.692 --> 19:57.122
Is this Mr. Son Wan Ki's home?

19:57.763 --> 19:59.891
He doesn't live here!

19:59.892 --> 20:01.432
How many times must I tell you?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.002
This is his address.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.563
(Lee Gun Young, Police Agency)

20:08.932 --> 20:10.902
He left a long time ago.

20:12.102 --> 20:13.172
Why?

20:21.576 --> 20:23.816
He just set his address
to his mistress' home.

20:24.276 --> 20:25.975
Can we believe in what she says?

20:26.246 --> 20:28.016
He could've been here a couple times.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.316
Are there any CCTV cameras?

20:31.455 --> 20:33.256
Let's take a look around.

20:33.385 --> 20:35.685
I'll go right. You go left. Let's go.

20:36.455 --> 20:37.496
Jae Hwan,

20:37.996 --> 20:39.295
that route is longer.

20:39.296 --> 20:40.965
- Lee Gun Young. - Yes?

20:41.125 --> 20:43.425
Work has been easy for you these days.
Hasn't it?

20:44.496 --> 20:47.106
You're beginning to sound more
and more like the captain.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.674
Hold on. I think you guys
are looking more alike too.

20:50.675 --> 20:53.536
Gosh. Get over here. That punk...

21:58.175 --> 21:59.776
Wait, what? No.

22:00.576 --> 22:03.445
- Where did he go? - This way.

22:04.546 --> 22:05.546
My gosh.

22:06.675 --> 22:07.685
What a bummer.

22:09.586 --> 22:12.586
It must've been tough trying
to tail me that obviously.

22:13.586 --> 22:15.256
Are you looking for Mr. Son Wan Ki?

22:15.526 --> 22:16.526
Yes.

22:18.356 --> 22:19.395
Who are you?

22:20.225 --> 22:21.424
Why are you lurking around here?

22:21.425 --> 22:23.585
Darn it, it took me lots of
work to find this address.

22:24.435 --> 22:27.336
I have to find him in a hurry.

22:28.465 --> 22:29.536
Do you know where he is?

22:31.387 --> 22:32.458
I mean,

22:33.087 --> 22:35.698
if you don't know, how would we know?

22:37.698 --> 22:39.728
That means you know who Son Wan Ki is.

22:51.808 --> 22:53.147
Haven't you heard?

22:54.147 --> 22:55.518
Son Wan Ki is dead.

22:58.718 --> 22:59.788
You didn't know?

23:06.587 --> 23:07.698
Hey, you.

23:12.998 --> 23:14.867
Don't you want to know how he died?

Show some respect for the deceased.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.367
Yes, that deceased man...

23:51.968 --> 23:53.738
came to see that woman from time to time...

23:54.278 --> 23:55.308
whenever he had money.

23:56.508 --> 23:58.176
What money? He was a credit delinquent.

23:58.177 --> 23:59.448
Come on, Detective.

24:00.077 --> 24:03.077
He paid back three months'
interest all at once in cash.

24:03.577 --> 24:04.697
Do you want to see our book?

24:05.647 --> 24:06.748
Where did he get the money?

24:09.417 --> 24:12.528
The rumor has it that
he found a new bookie.

24:13.827 --> 24:14.827
A bookie?

24:15.157 --> 24:19.427
He had been taking advantage of
this slow guy at a gambling den.

24:23.498 --> 24:25.438
Where is that gambling den?

24:28.407 --> 24:29.877
- Hey! - Bring it here.

24:30.478 --> 24:32.176
Darn it, man.

24:32.177 --> 24:34.518
- Cut it out. - What?

24:35.018 --> 24:36.677
I totally had that hand.

- What do you think you're doing? - Hey!

24:39.488 --> 24:41.518
I just played this card!

24:55.337 --> 24:57.137
You aren't from around here.

24:59.038 --> 25:00.167
Who are you looking for?

25:01.738 --> 25:03.907
The living or the dead?

25:06.407 --> 25:07.817
Do you know a man named Son Wan Ki?

25:08.617 --> 25:10.248
I hear he's a regular here.

25:10.718 --> 25:11.817
Son Wan Ki.

25:13.248 --> 25:14.488
Oh, Reporter Son.

25:15.218 --> 25:16.218
He's a reporter?

25:16.617 --> 25:18.587
I heard he used to be a reporter.

25:19.627 --> 25:22.327
He's quick-witted and quick to move too.

25:22.958 --> 25:25.867
But he isn't too bold, so
he's a lost cause around here.

25:27.337 --> 25:29.538
Did he associate with anyone here?

25:29.698 --> 25:32.667
Or someone he had bad blood with?

25:35.278 --> 25:37.748
That man isn't bold enough
for anybody's grudge.

25:38.407 --> 25:40.278
I heard he had a bookie.

25:42.617 --> 25:43.817
Oh, the doctor.

25:44.518 --> 25:45.587
The doctor?

25:51.558 --> 25:52.688
This must...

25:53.788 --> 25:55.427
seem like a hand tremor to you.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.627
But that person knew what
it was at first glance.

26:03.867 --> 26:05.508
Do you know what Parkinson's disease is?

26:12.077 --> 26:14.718
Do you know that doctor's name?

26:16.817 --> 26:17.948
Where does he work?

26:19.387 --> 26:20.718
I don't know that much.

26:25.288 --> 26:27.063
You must have cameras
around the gambling hall.

26:27.087 --> 26:29.558
Let me take a few files of
Mr. Son Wan Ki's footage.

26:31.627 --> 26:33.298
What will you do with it?

26:34.097 --> 26:35.667
He's dead anyway.

26:39.637 --> 26:41.208
I never said he died.

26:43.808 --> 26:44.847
Then...

26:45.548 --> 26:48.117
why would a detective come here
looking for someone who's alive?

26:54.188 --> 26:55.458
You're right about that.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.458
How did Reporter Son die?

27:03.657 --> 27:05.927
Lack of exercise and stress.

27:10.397 --> 27:12.708
He was probably eaten alive by beasts.

27:14.778 --> 27:15.808
Sorry?

27:17.677 --> 27:19.677
The beast that people keep.

27:21.377 --> 27:23.778
But the beast that also devours people.

27:26.887 --> 27:28.657
The beast that can...

27:30.188 --> 27:32.558
grow bigger or smaller than people.

Be careful...

27:39.397 --> 27:41.097

28:10.498 --> 28:11.538

28:14.067 --> 28:16.038
I think he knows where the cameras are.

This is the best shot.

stories during my training.

There was a big explosion in the 80s,

29:56.397 --> 29:58.717
but the MO was unidentified,
so it became an urban legend.

it was done by armed communists.

Do you remember Son Wan Ki?

33:14.938 --> 33:15.998
Who?

33:18.337 --> 33:20.968
Back when Chimera happened,

33:21.677 --> 33:23.938
the reporter who looked into Lee Sang Woo.

33:24.208 --> 33:25.407
Darn it.

33:27.948 --> 33:29.577
What about him?

33:30.917 --> 33:33.317
The dead man. It's him.

33:35.917 --> 33:37.488
His car exploded.

33:38.028 --> 33:40.188
In the exact same way as 35 years ago.

33:51.338 --> 33:52.808
- Do you... - What?

33:56.938 --> 33:58.047
Never mind.

34:02.748 --> 34:06.387
Captain Han. You retire soon and
must have a lot on your mind.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.018
Even so,

34:09.188 --> 34:12.657
why would you bring up something
from so many years ago?

34:42.688 --> 34:43.918
Why here?

34:49.398 --> 34:51.268
He doesn't just kill.

34:51.827 --> 34:54.097
An explosion, flames, a loud noise.

34:55.568 --> 34:58.867
He required a stage. Then...

35:08.117 --> 35:10.217
He follows, stops,

35:10.847 --> 35:12.547
and picks a location.

35:15.257 --> 35:16.918
But why here?

35:17.418 --> 35:19.087
It's a secluded area.

35:19.088 --> 35:22.157
There are not many people here
because it'll soon be redeveloped.

35:22.498 --> 35:23.727
Easy to notice,

35:23.728 --> 35:26.728
but there won't be any collateral damage.

35:28.068 --> 35:29.797
The criminal is a cautious person.

35:30.338 --> 35:33.137
Arsonists rarely put much
thought into anything.

35:33.538 --> 35:35.207
That's because rather than the target,

35:35.208 --> 35:36.977
their goal is to watch the fire blaze.

35:36.978 --> 35:39.777
That's right. I bet he watched.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.217
But from where?

36:06.737 --> 36:08.478
(Parking)

36:16.648 --> 36:18.188
(Parking)

36:18.447 --> 36:19.546
No.

36:19.547 --> 36:21.788
(Parking)

36:26.958 --> 36:28.827
He put something in the car first.

36:28.927 --> 36:30.728
(LPG)

36:32.628 --> 36:33.967
(LPG)

36:37.907 --> 36:40.867
No. To fill the whole car...

36:43.137 --> 36:45.847
(LPG)

36:49.018 --> 36:50.818
How would you fill a car with gas?

36:50.918 --> 36:53.148
If you stick a hose into the window...

36:55.088 --> 36:56.188
It would leak.

36:56.657 --> 36:58.327
Through the AC system?

36:59.188 --> 37:00.727
The trunk would be a better bet.

37:00.728 --> 37:02.797
You can stick a hose all the way in.

37:05.728 --> 37:06.728
(Caution)

37:08.498 --> 37:11.407
Wait. Where did the gas canister come from?

37:12.438 --> 37:13.867
From his own car?

37:14.907 --> 37:15.938
It's huge.

37:16.407 --> 37:17.538
What about the cart?

37:18.748 --> 37:22.117
The killer could've driven a truck.

37:22.878 --> 37:23.946
What?

37:23.947 --> 37:25.987
Should I look up the
trucks that came in here?

37:26.987 --> 37:29.858
Could it be someone who lives nearby?

37:31.458 --> 37:32.487
I doubt that.

37:40.128 --> 37:41.197
Hello?

37:43.697 --> 37:46.338
Yes. I left the message.

37:48.777 --> 37:50.438
Yes, today's fine.

37:50.677 --> 37:52.407
Okay. I'll come over.

37:54.378 --> 37:55.546
It's the Ppuyoppuyo Firefighter.

37:55.547 --> 37:57.447
He actually called.

37:58.887 --> 38:00.887
How much was the bet?

38:02.088 --> 38:03.117
Here.

38:04.257 --> 38:07.157
Hey, you owe me another bill.

38:08.657 --> 38:10.096
I'll go, then.

38:10.097 --> 38:12.728
- I'll give you a ride. - No, it's fine.

38:13.927 --> 38:16.136
Give me a call if you learn anything.

38:16.137 --> 38:19.068
(Police Line, Do Not Enter)

38:20.237 --> 38:22.108
It's the left.

38:22.577 --> 38:24.637
Your left. Left...

38:25.248 --> 38:26.308
Left.

38:26.608 --> 38:27.608
Okay.

39:14.827 --> 39:15.927
What are you looking at?

39:16.527 --> 39:18.967
Whatever one does with a gas canister,

39:19.597 --> 39:21.077
a person who people would not notice.

39:22.097 --> 39:24.168
Gun Young, what's an arsonist's main goal?

39:24.668 --> 39:26.966
- To watch the fire. - Say you set a bomb.

39:26.967 --> 39:28.808
Where would you go to watch?

39:29.038 --> 39:32.308
Somewhere too close would be dangerous.

39:33.007 --> 39:34.108
A good vantage point?

39:34.748 --> 39:36.847
That's the only building facing this way.

39:37.648 --> 39:39.547
That building's going to be torn down.

39:39.987 --> 39:41.827
But why does that flat
have new window frames?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.717
Everyone else has left,

39:45.458 --> 39:47.128
but one stayed back?

39:55.440 --> 39:58.008
- It was morning, not dawn. - What was?

39:58.009 --> 39:59.980
The explosion was meant
to happen in the morning.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.310
What?

40:01.311 --> 40:03.619
The peak time for frauds and
gamblers is early morning.

40:04.049 --> 40:05.850
They let you win until 2 or 3am,

40:06.190 --> 40:07.989
then get to work after 4am.

40:09.319 --> 40:12.330
Son Wan Ki loses everything
and leaves in the morning.

40:13.489 --> 40:16.230
The sun rises and shines
through the windows.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.630
Those windows face east.

40:20.369 --> 40:21.869
Toward the rising sun.

40:22.199 --> 40:25.440
You can't enjoy a blazing fire
if the sun's in your face.

40:26.270 --> 40:28.210
It requires some set up.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.839
I must be able to see you,

40:31.909 --> 40:33.779
but you must not be able to see me.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.179
In that case...

40:39.389 --> 40:40.449
tinted windowpanes.

40:41.790 --> 40:43.790
(The day of the Lord
will come like a thief.)

40:46.029 --> 40:47.229
(The day of the Lord
will come like a thief.)

40:47.230 --> 40:51.330
Sinil-dong 416, Unit 405.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.580
Since it's apartment
405, it must be that one.

42:02.721 --> 42:03.821
Excuse me.

42:10.460 --> 42:11.560
Excuse me.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.431
Excuse me. Do you...

42:18.670 --> 42:19.670
Stop right there!

42:32.080 --> 42:33.080
Hey!

42:40.960 --> 42:41.991
Hey!

42:52.670 --> 42:53.701
Hey, you!

43:01.610 --> 43:03.250
That punk. Go around!

43:10.721 --> 43:11.761
Hey, you!

44:02.341 --> 44:05.610
Hello. Are you the one who
called me upon seeing my blog?

44:06.080 --> 44:08.241
Yes, are you Ppuyoppuyo Firefighter?

44:08.880 --> 44:10.580
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

44:11.451 --> 44:12.721
It's okay.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.591
May I ask why you called?

44:16.621 --> 44:19.321
I was curious about a
few things you posted.

44:21.560 --> 44:22.630
Did you see him?

44:24.661 --> 44:25.959
He's not here.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.531
He's really fast.

44:27.830 --> 44:29.031
Did you find anything?

44:29.431 --> 44:31.971
Get the CCTV footage from all
the buildings in the route.

44:32.701 --> 44:34.141
I'll keep looking for him.

44:36.471 --> 44:40.241
I looked into the case because
I was interested in it.

44:40.911 --> 44:43.580
It was in 1984, so it was 35 years ago.

44:44.551 --> 44:46.480
Why were you interested in the case?

44:46.980 --> 44:48.991
There was a fire, but no cause.

44:49.750 --> 44:52.290
It's scary, and it's cool.

44:53.491 --> 44:55.390
It even had a nickname.

44:55.391 --> 44:58.931
People who love mysteries
called it the Chimera Case.

44:59.201 --> 45:01.130
Oh, Chimera?

45:01.661 --> 45:02.770
So you've heard of it.

45:03.801 --> 45:07.301
The shape of the lighter
found at the scene...

45:09.471 --> 45:12.911
That wasn't revealed to the public.

45:14.310 --> 45:16.010
I heard about it during my training.

45:16.011 --> 45:18.820
Us firefighters look into
the cause of the ignition...

45:18.821 --> 45:20.250
and do debates on it.

45:21.951 --> 45:24.091
Do you know the cause of ignition?

45:24.190 --> 45:27.060
I found out later.

45:27.121 --> 45:29.360
Of course, there's no way to prove it.

45:29.931 --> 45:30.991
What is it?

47:23.841 --> 47:25.141
(Detective Cha)

47:26.241 --> 47:29.080
Detective Cha. I was
just about to call you.

47:29.851 --> 47:32.451
Agent Hathaway, can you
look at something for me?

47:44.591 --> 47:47.560
Isn't this a chimera?

47:49.130 --> 47:51.471
Where are you?

47:51.900 --> 47:54.470
I'm by the scene of the crime.
I think this is his hideout.

47:54.471 --> 47:56.011
How did you find it?

47:56.440 --> 47:57.840
Do you remember the
building in front of us?

47:57.841 --> 47:59.240
We were questioning people there...

47:59.241 --> 48:01.141
when we saw someone suspicious.

48:02.250 --> 48:03.851
Take a look at this.

48:04.610 --> 48:06.410
You can see the scene
of the crime from here.

48:10.051 --> 48:13.060
The windows are blocked off...

48:13.460 --> 48:16.391
What do you mean "blocked off"?

48:20.630 --> 48:22.130
What else is in that room?

48:35.580 --> 48:36.650
Hold on.

48:37.710 --> 48:38.750
What is it?

48:39.650 --> 48:40.750
You have to leave.

48:41.580 --> 48:43.891
- What? - You have to get out of there now!

48:45.321 --> 48:46.591
What are you talking about?

48:53.460 --> 48:56.140
You have to get out of there right now.
There's no time to explain.

49:21.991 --> 49:24.161
The door isn't opening.

49:25.230 --> 49:26.960
I think he broke it on purpose.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.130
Don't move. It's dangerous.

49:31.201 --> 49:32.270
Why?

49:33.101 --> 49:36.040
The place is completely filled with it.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.371
No color. No odor.

50:09.710 --> 50:12.511
Is it oxygen?

50:16.810 --> 50:19.170
Out of everything I've experienced,
oxygen is the scariest.

50:19.650 --> 50:21.820
It makes up about 20 percent
of the air we breathe,

50:21.821 --> 50:24.021
but if it goes up even 1
percent, it becomes dangerous.

50:24.491 --> 50:25.661
We call it "over range".

50:26.161 --> 50:27.720
In a sealed room,

50:27.721 --> 50:29.681
if the oxygen level simply
goes up to 30 percent,

50:29.891 --> 50:32.630
the room will be ablaze
even with the tiniest spark.

50:35.101 --> 50:37.500
Do not move. You cannot make a move.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.601
A tiny spark, no, even statics
will put an end to everything.

50:43.511 --> 50:45.511
That's why there was nothing in the scene.

50:47.181 --> 50:49.181
Nothing is left behind
when everything burns down.

50:54.980 --> 50:56.540
Wait just a little. I'll be there soon.

51:10.830 --> 51:11.830
Agent Hathaway.

51:14.801 --> 51:15.810
I think it's too late.

51:17.741 --> 51:18.741
Detective Cha.

51:20.141 --> 51:21.181
Detective Cha!

52:12.830 --> 52:14.201
(Emergency Center)

52:16.270 --> 52:17.899
The fall patient is here!

52:17.900 --> 52:20.240
Jae Hwan, wake up. Wake up, Jae Hwan!

52:20.241 --> 52:22.041
We need an orthopedic surgeon.
Call them now.

52:24.241 --> 52:25.721
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

52:27.241 --> 52:29.250
Sir, guardians must wait outside.

52:32.451 --> 52:34.519
His pupils are fine. Check his vitals.

52:34.520 --> 52:35.520
Yes, Doctor.

52:39.891 --> 52:41.391
Bring me dressing and suture.

52:43.790 --> 52:46.230
His vitals are fine. So
is his oxygen saturation.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
Hurry.

52:52.031 --> 52:53.040
Saline.

52:57.371 --> 52:58.371
Forceps.

53:23.971 --> 53:25.000
Are you all right?

53:36.781 --> 53:37.851
Detective Cha.

53:44.790 --> 53:45.860
Agent Hathaway.

53:46.661 --> 53:47.721
Are you all right?

54:22.761 --> 54:23.860
Eugene.

55:20.781 --> 55:21.821
(Seoryoon Hospital)

55:33.601 --> 55:35.330
- This way. - In here?

55:49.681 --> 55:52.781
Oh. You're here.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.650
Where is he?

55:59.221 --> 56:01.320
Hey, Mom. You're here.

56:01.321 --> 56:02.891
Jae Hwan, are you okay?

56:03.190 --> 56:04.830
Are you allowed to walk around like this?

56:05.060 --> 56:06.601
I heard you fell from a building.

56:07.330 --> 56:10.130
Hey, goodness. Listen to this kid.

56:10.601 --> 56:11.630
It's me.

56:11.931 --> 56:13.740
It was about 3, 4 stories.

56:13.741 --> 56:16.070
I spun around three times in the air,

56:16.071 --> 56:18.270
then rolled on my back. The end.

56:18.770 --> 56:20.540
I'm fine. I'm completely fine.

56:20.810 --> 56:22.951
Mr. Cha, you can't move around like this.

56:23.210 --> 56:25.491
Those cracked bones are more
dangerous than broken bones.

56:30.051 --> 56:32.121
You got fractured? Where?

56:34.891 --> 56:36.730
- Ribs... - Say it right.

56:37.431 --> 56:40.801
Ribs. Just a little.
Everything else is fine.

56:45.031 --> 56:47.700
I'm sorry. It's...

56:47.701 --> 56:49.741
You're hurt, you can't
walk around like that.

56:50.371 --> 56:52.710
The sun was nice, so I took a walk.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.560
Mom, I'm...

57:14.230 --> 57:15.431
I just needed to see you.

57:15.801 --> 57:19.130
Since you're here already,
you should stay for a meal.

57:19.341 --> 57:20.500
We aren't here to celebrate.

57:22.170 --> 57:25.011
And I can't be away from the
store for too long. I'm leaving.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.710
Goodbye, Ms. Cha.

57:30.310 --> 57:32.150
I'll see her off. Get back in bed.

57:46.201 --> 57:47.230
Are you all right?

57:51.730 --> 57:52.940
Let me take you home.

57:56.940 --> 57:57.971
I'm fine.

59:14.020 --> 59:16.990
(Chimera)

59:16.991 --> 59:18.391
When something is burnt,

59:19.051 --> 59:20.591
it can also mean purification.

59:21.221 --> 59:23.531
There was an explosion
in the middle of Seoul.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.129
Maybe the culprit is
set on the next target.

59:26.130 --> 59:29.060
People can't really tell when
people like us kill someone.

59:30.431 --> 59:31.471
The doctor.

59:31.871 --> 59:34.431
Why are these cases similar, and
