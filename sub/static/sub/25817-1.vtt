[Patty] <i>I've heard stories of girls
who grow up happy and well adjusted...</i>

00:13.639 --> 00:14.473
[baby laughs]

00:14.932 --> 00:18.602
<i>...with a healthy relationship
to food and their bodies.</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:20.437
[record scratch]

00:20.521 --> 00:21.563
<i>Screw those bitches!</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.440
[ding, ding, ding]

00:23.524 --> 00:26.652
<i>I went on my first diet
at just eight years old.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:29.530
<i>For as long as I can remember,
I've been hungry.</i>

00:30.072 --> 00:31.365
<i>Insatiable, really.</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:34.743
<i>I spent my entire adolescence
hating my body,</i>

00:35.077 --> 00:38.539
<i>the target of bullying and cruel jokes.</i>

00:38.664 --> 00:42.709
<i>So, while my classmates were out
losing their virginity,</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:45.295
<i>I was at home, stuffing another hole,</i>

00:45.837 --> 00:47.130
<i>binging my brains out</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:50.676
<i>and watching every Drew Barrymore movie
ever made.</i>

00:51.093 --> 00:52.594
<i>With Nonnie, my only friend.</i>

00:53.220 --> 00:55.806
<i>But if you're thinking
of feeling bad for me, don't.</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:57.224
<i>I know now.</i>

00:57.307 --> 01:00.727
<i>All of those years I spent
feeling miserable,</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:02.771
<i>they made me who I am.</i>

01:02.938 --> 01:05.774
<i>So I would be ready
when I met Bob Armstrong.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:09.570
- [old man] Hi, Bob.
- [Patty] <i>He was my destiny.</i>

01:09.778 --> 01:12.447
[Bob] <i> I never much believed in destiny.</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:15.617
- [bicycle bell dings, dog barks]
- <i>I was the master of my own fate.</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:18.662
<i>I had a booming law practice,</i>

01:19.079 --> 01:21.707
<i>a wardrobe to rival Andy Cohen's,</i>

01:21.873 --> 01:23.959
<i>a picture-perfect family.</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:27.379
<i>But my greatest joy</i>

01:27.462 --> 01:30.716
<i>was the time I spent moonlighting
as a pageant coach.</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:32.134
<i>Who would have thought</i>

01:32.217 --> 01:35.053
<i>playing Henry Higgins
in a church production of My Fair Lady</i>

01:35.137 --> 01:37.764
<i>would have shown me my true calling?</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:41.393
<i>Helping young ladies
become their very best selves.</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:42.311
[applause]

01:42.686 --> 01:43.854
<i>But that wasn't enough.</i>

01:44.146 --> 01:46.898
<i>I had an insatiable need to win</i>

01:47.399 --> 01:50.110
<i>and Dixie Sinclair could go all the way.</i>

01:50.444 --> 01:52.154
<i>There was just one problem,</i>

01:52.738 --> 01:54.072
<i>her personality.</i>

01:54.156 --> 01:56.533
So, we've been thinking
about what you said.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.576
About my interview.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.037
Yes, neutral topics, no politics.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.997
Neutral won't win.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.458
We came up with a great argument

02:04.541 --> 02:06.960
about keeping trannies
out of the ladies room.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.502
You can't stay "trannies."

02:08.628 --> 02:10.172
[quieter] You can't stay "trannies."

02:10.839 --> 02:12.924
- It's homophobic.
- We're not!

02:13.175 --> 02:15.260
We wanna keep the homophobes
out of our country.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.304
Oh, my god.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.973
[Patty] <i>I was tired of making food
my higher power,</i>

02:20.057 --> 02:21.600
<i>I wanted to be in control.</i>

02:21.892 --> 02:23.894
<i>I went on a cleanse,
started counting my steps.</i>

02:23.977 --> 02:25.187
Take a lap, you're late.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.607
Smells like bacon.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.524
[girls chuckle]

02:29.608 --> 02:30.817
Just ignore 'em.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.820
Are you okay?
When was the last time you ate?

02:34.363 --> 02:35.697
Last... Tuesday.

02:35.781 --> 02:36.740
[thump]

02:37.032 --> 02:39.034
[Patty] <i>I was used
to feeling bad about myself.</i>

02:39.451 --> 02:41.203
<i>High school was a nightmare.</i>

02:42.454 --> 02:44.289
<i>But Brick Armstrong...</i>

02:45.749 --> 02:49.294
<i>was like a dream come true.</i>

02:56.593 --> 02:58.011
[Bobby] <i>There was only one person</i>

02:58.095 --> 03:01.098
<i>who was a bigger nightmare
than Dixie's mom, Regina.</i>

03:01.390 --> 03:04.601
Hey! I wanted to wish y'all luck.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.105
[Bobby] <i>Bob Bag-o-Boners Barnard.</i>

03:08.271 --> 03:11.149
<i>He was the DA, my nemesis in work,</i>

03:11.316 --> 03:13.735
<i>and he was my nemesis in life.</i>

03:14.069 --> 03:18.240
<i>With his perfect hair and his
perfect smile and his perfect beard.</i>

03:18.573 --> 03:19.408
Bob.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.993
[hands clap, both laugh]

03:23.662 --> 03:25.414
Good luck to you and Magnolia, too.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.334
[Bobby] <i>His daughter, Magnolia,
had won every pageant in Georgia.</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:32.129
<i>I was dying to dethrone her.</i>

03:32.337 --> 03:35.799
No family should live in fear
of their child getting sick

03:35.882 --> 03:37.759
because they can't afford health care.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.344
Thank you.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.055
[applause]

03:42.347 --> 03:46.393
[Bobby] <i>Dixie and Magnolia were tied.
It all came down to the interview.</i>

03:47.394 --> 03:48.687
[host] Dixie Sinclair.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.898
What are your thoughts about ISIS?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.109
[Bobby] <i>A political question.</i>

03:54.609 --> 03:57.279
<i>I prayed that Dixie
would follow my guidance.</i>

03:57.362 --> 04:00.323
Ices? Like Italian ices?

04:00.949 --> 04:03.243
I love 'em. Orange is my favorite.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.120
Thank you.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.455
[microphone squeals]

04:06.538 --> 04:08.749
[Bobby] <i>But fate had other plans.</i>

04:09.332 --> 04:10.792
[Patty] I feel like a stalker.

04:11.376 --> 04:15.172
The fact that Brick comes here for beer
every night and we happen to be here

04:15.255 --> 04:16.589
is pure coincidence.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.798
[cash register clacking]

04:17.882 --> 04:20.469
Oh, my god, he's here. Come on.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.679
Let's go.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.848
[Nonnie] Brick. Brick Armstrong?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.975
Yeah? Oh.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.394
You're the one from my gym class.
You feeling better?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.021
Er, yeah.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.817
Patty wants to ask you for coffee,

04:36.276 --> 04:37.694
to say thanks for earlier.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.780
You know, like a date.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.615
Ow.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.410
God, you thought that
just 'cause I was nice to you, that...

04:47.287 --> 04:48.955
Wow. Wow, uh...

04:49.623 --> 04:50.457
I gotta go.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.626
[footsteps departing]

04:52.709 --> 04:54.169
[door creaks open]

04:56.922 --> 04:58.423
[applause]

04:58.882 --> 05:02.302
[Bobby] <i>I was crushed,
but I had to keep a brave face.</i>

05:04.471 --> 05:05.889
This is your fault!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.016
For trying to dim her light.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.143
I want my money back, or else.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.646
Or else what? It's over, Regina.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.649
[triumphant music playing]

05:22.697 --> 05:23.865
[Magnolia gasps]

05:23.949 --> 05:25.992
I demand a rematch!

05:26.451 --> 05:29.037
Dixie was disturbed, because of him.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.873
He touched her hoo-hoo!

05:32.499 --> 05:34.209
What? No, no!

05:35.168 --> 05:36.127
She's lying!

05:36.837 --> 05:38.171
[Bobby] <i>And that was it.</i>

05:38.630 --> 05:42.175
<i>I was an accused molester
saying the victim made it up,</i>

05:42.592 --> 05:45.470
<i>which was almost as bad
as if I'd actually done it.</i>

05:45.554 --> 05:49.349
<i>It was the single worst moment of my life.</i>

05:50.058 --> 05:52.102
[Patty] <i>I thought it was
the worst moment of my life.</i>

05:52.185 --> 05:54.396
<i>But looking back, it was one of the best.</i>

05:54.479 --> 05:56.648
<i>'Cause it brought me to the man
who put me on the path</i>

05:56.731 --> 05:59.067
<i>to becoming the most famous beauty queen
in the country.</i>

05:59.401 --> 06:01.361
Hey, you got five bucks?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.238
How about that candy bar?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.407
It's not like you need it, fatty.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.785
[thump]

06:09.119 --> 06:11.913
[Patty] <i>What can I say?
This story is full of some crazy...</i>

06:12.539 --> 06:13.832
[thump]

06:17.002 --> 06:19.004
[Bobby] <i>Regina never formally
pressed charges,</i>

06:19.087 --> 06:20.839
<i>because she made the whole thing up,</i>

06:21.298 --> 06:23.925
<i>but she still ruined my reputation.</i>

06:24.009 --> 06:25.176
[indistinct whisper]

06:26.219 --> 06:31.433
<i>Three months later, I still couldn't get
a single coaching gig, or legal case.</i>

06:31.516 --> 06:34.227
- [passer-by] Don't look him in the eye.
- [Bobby] <i>I felt empty</i>

06:34.311 --> 06:37.188
<i>and the last thing I needed
was a pep talk from my dad.</i>

06:38.106 --> 06:39.691
You had so much potential, Bob.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.484
Graduated top of the class.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.612
Best damn litigator in all of Georgia.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.322
Civil litigation, criminal.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.658
Then you went and ruined it,
by trying to play princess,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.619
- like some big old...
- Can we skip the lecture

06:50.702 --> 06:53.455
- and just get straight to the firing?
- Oh, I'm not gonna fire you yet.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.957
Matter of fact, I have a case for you.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.876
Defending a teenage girl.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.794
She punched a homeless guy in the face.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.547
They can't pay, but at least
it'll give you something to do.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.257
Since when do we do pro-bono?

07:04.341 --> 07:07.177
Since nobody cares about fatties
or homeless people.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.763
I'm tired of you sitting around
doing diddly squat.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.975
You're an embarrassment, Bob.
To me, to yourself, to the family, to me.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.102
You said "to me" twice.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.521
Thank you so much for coming.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.192
I begged every lawyer in town
to take my daughter's case pro-bono.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.612
I am an advocate for the underdog,
being one myself.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.866
I'm sorry, but as a mother,
I just have to ask.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.286
The accusations were completely false.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.830
I'm a champion of women,
especially young women.

07:36.122 --> 07:40.418
I wanna touch as many of them
as I possibly can.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.504
[clears throat] Is your daughter at home?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.255
Oh, unfortunately, no.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.257
I will need to speak with her.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.842
Well, she'll email you.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.388
Oh, her jaw's wired shut.
That homeless guy broke it.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.139
She's the one who got arrested?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.891
Well, she did break his nose.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.810
He tried to take away her chocolate bar.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.104
She's very serious about her food.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.857
Here, here she is.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.861
See? It can't be easy, you know,

08:07.237 --> 08:08.363
looking like that

08:09.239 --> 08:11.282
and having a mother who looks like me.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.328
[Bobby] <i>I didn't have to imagine,
I'd lived through it.</i>

08:15.745 --> 08:18.164
<i>My own yearbook filled with insults.</i>

08:18.248 --> 08:20.792
[Patty's mother]
I was almost Miss Georgia back in the day,

08:20.875 --> 08:22.252
but I got knocked up.

08:23.086 --> 08:23.920
Had Patty,

08:24.963 --> 08:26.715
started at the Wiener Taco.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.633
I blame myself.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.176
I was a drunken whore.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.636
But I am sober now.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.807
And I really wanna do right by her.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.394
Her arraignment is in two days, so...

08:41.520 --> 08:42.355
Please.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.775
Mr. Armstrong...

08:47.110 --> 08:48.403
Can't you help us?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.575
[door creaks shut]

08:53.658 --> 08:55.952
I got a case.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.414
- We're celebrating.
- Nobody's coming to our gala.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.375
Regina Sinclair sent an email
to the entire PTA.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.336
[Regina] <i> If any of y'all go to
that molester's gala,</i>

09:05.462 --> 09:07.547
<i>me and all of the other single moms</i>

09:07.630 --> 09:10.091
<i>will veto
the daddy-daughter chastity dance.</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:12.719
She should. It's creepy and incestuous.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.345
Bob, that is not the point.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.972
We have got to do something.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.682
I'm gonna talk to Etta Mae Barnard.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.601
Oh, absolutely not.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.687
Bob, Etta Mae has influence
and if we wanna get back

09:22.812 --> 09:24.689
- into high society...
- Wait, wait.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.442
Is that why you started this center?
I thought

09:27.525 --> 09:29.444
you wanted to honor my mama's memory.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.030
[tense music playing]

09:35.700 --> 09:37.202
Do you wanna talk about your mama?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.079
Or do you wanna celebrate?

09:42.832 --> 09:45.752
- [Bobby unzips pants, unbuckles belt]
- [Coralee unzips dress]

09:47.545 --> 09:48.588
[knocking on door]

09:50.840 --> 09:51.841
Dinner's ready.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.137
Adele, again.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.098
You got dumped three months ago.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.934
Just trying to drown out you and Mom
celebrating in the kitchen.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.144
Brick Armstrong, show some respect.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.355
You got something on your pants.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.693
[door creaks shut, cell phone chiming]

10:13.446 --> 10:15.406
[Bobby] <i>I decided to go
for a plea agreement.</i>

10:16.199 --> 10:17.158
<i>Settle for probation.</i>

10:17.242 --> 10:19.744
<i>I figured the best I could do
was keep Patty out of jail,</i>

10:19.828 --> 10:20.870
<i>and move on.</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:23.540
Where's Patty?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.834
- You said she got her wires out today.
- [Patty] I'm right here.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.628
[slow-motion swoosh]

10:30.964 --> 10:33.925
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Armstrong.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.761
[Bobby] <i>Broken jaw, liquid diet.</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:49.498
There was something going on
between him and jail bait Jane.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.752
This could be our chance
to take him out for good.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.130
You mean, kill him?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.217
- Hey, diddle diddle.
- Regina.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.929
Whatever it is you're doing, please stop.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.515
You know, I never touched her.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.059
Plenty of people think you did.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.979
Plenty of people think
red and pink don't clash.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.565
Excuse me, I have a speech to give.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.697
A lot of people ask me, why anal cancer?

21:21.989 --> 21:26.285
My mother was afflicted
by this terrible disease,

21:27.077 --> 21:29.997
but so many are affected
and don't seek treatment.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.583
They're embarrassed by the symptoms.

21:33.584 --> 21:34.418
Diarrhea.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.795
[fart noise]

21:35.878 --> 21:38.088
- [guests clamoring in disgust]
- [man] Disgusting!

21:38.464 --> 21:40.132
[clears throat] Rectal itching.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.592
[makes fart noise]

21:43.803 --> 21:45.179
Fecal discharge.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.263
[makes fart noise]

21:47.807 --> 21:49.642
Seriously. What is she, like five?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.728
We have to bring anal cancer
out of the closet.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.898
It is a silent, but deadly killer.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.859
- Does he even know what he's saying?
- Sorry we're late.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.236
Barnard.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.988
We just got back from the county fair.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.450
Magnolia qualified for Miss Magic Jesus.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.701
- Oh!
- [guests applaud]

22:08.452 --> 22:10.079
[Bobby] That's great, but, er...

22:10.162 --> 22:11.705
Thank you for coming,

22:11.789 --> 22:13.874
we've got a great turnout.
Thanks you to Etta Mae.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.960
- [Bobby] Excuse me?
- Oh, well, a deal's a deal.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.254
And I talked to the junior leaguers
about you, too.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.507
- Ahem. As I was saying...
- Did you get a spray tan?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.759
Oh, I've been training for a marathon,

22:23.843 --> 22:26.011
- so maybe I got some color.
- [Bobby] Honey?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.473
Well, you are glowing.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.267
- [thuds, microphone squeals]
- Are we done?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.812
[shouting] Or is your tan more important

22:34.895 --> 22:38.524
than saving someone's anus from cancer?

22:38.607 --> 22:39.775
[guests gasp]

22:39.859 --> 22:41.026
[murmuring]

22:43.654 --> 22:45.197
<i>One! Kick!</i>

22:46.156 --> 22:47.825
You ruined everything!

22:48.325 --> 22:49.451
All my hard work!

22:49.827 --> 22:52.329
I'm sorry, Regina and Dixie threw me off.

22:52.538 --> 22:56.000
And then Bob Backstreet Boy Barnard
stole my spotlight.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.918
And now I can't join the Junior League.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.545
Back to square one.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.380
[Bobby] <i>Except I wasn't.</i>

23:04.174 --> 23:06.385
That's Patty.
We're working on her testimony.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.304
Can you get the door?
I have got to change.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.515
[Regina] That's him.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.059
Unfortunately,
I don't have anything on the girl.

23:14.852 --> 23:15.686
That's fine.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.771
I'll just start by following him.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.148
I'm sorry.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.860
You just...
You seem awfully young to be a PI.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.153
And hot.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.156
I promise, ladies.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.949
I'm very experienced.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.076
[PI laughs]

23:33.037 --> 23:34.830
Everybody thinks we're sisters.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.752
I mean,
I could take it from my peers and my mom.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.254
Even my Nutra-Right leader.

23:43.881 --> 23:44.840
But, this guy?

23:44.924 --> 23:47.259
I mean, this guy who smelled
of booze and onions...

23:47.343 --> 23:50.387
Stop! When you're on the stand,
you are playing a role.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.973
And you are done playing fatty Patty.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.017
Remember, seduce me.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.770
- Play the damsel.
- I'm trying.

23:58.854 --> 23:59.855
Come here.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.607
[Patty] <i> I wanted to let go of fatty Patty,</i>

24:01.732 --> 24:05.402
<i>but after all those years of torture,
she was in me, like a demon.</i>

24:05.819 --> 24:06.654
Now.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.032
Tell me what you feel about what you see.

24:10.824 --> 24:11.867
I don't know.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.537
[exhales] Close your eyes.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.459
Tell me the truth.

24:21.043 --> 24:21.961
[Patty chuckles]

24:24.254 --> 24:25.881
I feel like I don't deserve you.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.926
Your support.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.261
You think you deserve to be punched?

24:32.096 --> 24:33.055
You didn't.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.226
You were the victim of bullying,
of society.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.187
He was right.
I was fat, I was out of control.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.315
- You were sick, you were scared.
- I still want to eat all the time.

24:43.399 --> 24:45.192
- And why don't you?
- Because...

24:47.111 --> 24:49.571
I'm afraid if I get fat again,
you won't think I'm beautiful.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.578
You are beautiful. Inside and out.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.416
You came through hell
and lived to tell about it.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.169
And when you are on that stand,
you are gonna find that voice,

25:04.253 --> 25:07.256
so you never have to eat over it again.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.593
- What if I can't?
- You can.

25:12.553 --> 25:13.762
I'll help ya.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.600
Because I believe in you.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.102
[birds chirping]

25:22.312 --> 25:23.147
And...

25:24.940 --> 25:26.150
Because quite honestly,

25:27.317 --> 25:28.527
you're the first person,

25:28.736 --> 25:31.071
in a very long time,
that has believed in me.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.662
[both exhale sharply]

25:40.080 --> 25:42.750
[camera zoom whirring, shutter clicks]

26:03.604 --> 26:06.815
[Bobby] <i>I'd filed a motion to dismiss
and everything was in order.</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:08.776
<i>Patty looked great.</i>

26:09.234 --> 26:11.779
<i>And homeless guy
didn't even bother to show up.</i>

26:12.362 --> 26:15.532
<i>But it was up to me to prove self-defense,</i>

26:15.991 --> 26:19.286
<i>which meant Patty had to be
more convincing than the clerk.</i>

26:22.748 --> 26:23.749
What was that?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.460
He's like, kind of in love with me.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.545
- Because I...
- Don't say another word.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.591
[Bobby] <i>It was a risk
to call their witness myself,</i>

26:33.008 --> 26:36.136
<i>but if Patty was right,
I could ruin their case</i>

26:36.678 --> 26:40.140
<i>and stick it to Bob Baby Banana Barnard.</i>

26:40.474 --> 26:42.476
<i>So, I took a leap of faith.</i>

26:42.559 --> 26:43.811
[exhales sharply]

26:45.604 --> 26:48.065
The defense calls Donald Choi.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.650
[crowd gasps]

26:49.733 --> 26:53.570
Tell us the events of August 29th,
as you recall them.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.032
[irreverent music playing]

27:02.329 --> 27:05.207
Let me remind you, young man,
that you're under oath.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.046
I don't remember.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.465
I'm sorry.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.554
[Bobby] <i>Whatever Patty had done,
it worked.</i>

27:19.054 --> 27:20.848
<i>Now, it all came down to her testimony.</i>

27:20.931 --> 27:23.392
He threatened me verbally

27:23.976 --> 27:27.479
and then he got physically aggressive.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.816
He was making comments about my body,
so I thought...

27:31.608 --> 27:33.318
he was gonna try and force himself on me.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.653
And what did you do?

27:35.487 --> 27:36.947
I defended myself.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.742
Nothing further, your honor.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.245
[Bobby] <i>Patty had played
the damsel perfectly.</i>

27:43.579 --> 27:48.500
<i>She just had to survive
a cross examination by Captain Dildacorn.</i>

27:48.917 --> 27:50.085
Ms. Bladell.

27:50.711 --> 27:51.962
[inhales]

27:52.045 --> 27:54.882
You said the victim
commented on your body.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.216
What did he say exactly?

27:57.176 --> 27:58.343
He called me a fatty.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.888
"And nobody calls me fatty!"

28:01.930 --> 28:04.850
That was the written statement
you gave the arresting officer.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.103
- I don't remember writing that.
- Your remember punching him?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.148
Hard enough to break his nose?

28:11.732 --> 28:12.816
Yes, but...

28:12.941 --> 28:16.403
Would you say you're a violent person,
Ms. Bladell?

28:16.987 --> 28:19.448
No. No, definitely not.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.783
So then why would you hit him?

28:22.534 --> 28:25.037
Was it because
he was trying to take your food?

28:28.457 --> 28:31.210
Sure, fatty Patty threw a punch
to protect her chocolate.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.175
Are you saying...
I deserved what happened?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.677
Just because I was fat?

28:41.553 --> 28:44.431
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- Because I didn't.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.725
And if you're saying that,

28:47.142 --> 28:50.812
then you're telling every single
overweight teenager in America to just...

28:51.563 --> 28:53.315
shut up and take it.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.778
Even if it means
getting punched in the face.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.367
And that's not exactly a message
I wanna be sending.

29:03.951 --> 29:04.910
Do you, your honor?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.204
[upbeat music playing]

29:14.378 --> 29:15.921
Case dismissed!

29:16.296 --> 29:18.507
We should celebrate, make out.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.550
With guys, not each other.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.470
It's balls that homeless guy
wasn't there to see me win.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.265
- Can we file a counter suit?
- Why? He's homeless.

29:26.348 --> 29:30.602
Yeah, I want revenge against anyone
who has ever been mean to me.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.980
I had a taste of victory,
but it's not enough.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.941
- I want more.
- The best revenge is a life well lived.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.946
You could be a role model for girls
that struggle with their weight.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.406
You could show them what's possible.

29:42.823 --> 29:45.784
You could help change the system
from the inside.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.328
Pageants.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.497
I'd like to coach you.

29:51.164 --> 29:53.208
Excuse, like beauty pageants?

29:53.292 --> 29:56.503
Yes! Look at her, Angie, she's stunning.

29:56.878 --> 30:00.257
Yeah, I know,
she looks like me when I was her age,

30:00.507 --> 30:02.509
- except smaller boobs.
- And...

30:03.635 --> 30:04.636
[hesitating]

30:05.554 --> 30:06.680
You won your first.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.933
Being in front of a judge,
that is the biggest pageant there is.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.019
Beauty pageant.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.771
We'll start small, Miss Magic Jesus.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.482
But with me on your team,

30:17.941 --> 30:23.739
I think you have a shot
at being the next Miss USA.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.074
What do you say?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.076
[sighs]

30:31.913 --> 30:33.081
Absolutely not.

30:33.623 --> 30:37.794
I don't want my daughter
sexualized, objectified.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.297
Especially not by older men.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.258
You stay away, okay? From both of us.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.802
No, mom! Hey!

30:50.390 --> 30:53.268
[Angie] I don't wanna hear another word
about Bob Armstrong, okay?

30:53.352 --> 30:55.062
You won your case, you got skinny.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.605
- That's enough.
- No, it's not.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.359
I could be famous,
like Drew Barrymore famous.

31:00.609 --> 31:03.570
So all those jack holes
who made fun of me will be so jealous,

31:03.653 --> 31:04.821
they can't even breathe.

31:04.905 --> 31:09.493
Come on, I'm a 100 days sober.
Today is supposed to be about me!

31:11.244 --> 31:13.622
Crap, these donuts are supposed to be
for the meeting.

31:13.997 --> 31:17.417
I have a box of chocolates in the trunk,
if you wanna pound those back, too?

31:19.169 --> 31:20.420
Those my shorty shorts?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.297
Yeah, that okay?

31:23.173 --> 31:25.842
Sure, they look better on you.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.557
Her mother was jealous,
it was written all over her face.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.268
I was gonna help her do
something important.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.854
Well, it's not like
she'll be curing ass cancer.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.941
I can't imagine
how different my life would be,

31:41.274 --> 31:44.277
if someone had encouraged me to be myself,

31:44.611 --> 31:48.448
instead of spending my entire adolescence
being the other Bob

31:48.532 --> 31:54.287
being obfuscated by the dazzling light
that is Bob Bagina Barnard.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.206
Did you just say "bagina"?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.792
Plus, he's so perfect all the time!

31:59.167 --> 32:03.463
Him and Etta Mae and Magnolia.
It's just...

32:03.547 --> 32:06.091
Ugh, if Patty had just let me coach her.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.342
Oh my god.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.095
You never cared about helping that girl,

32:10.178 --> 32:11.847
you just wanted to stick it
to Bob Barnard.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.141
- That is so not true.
- That is true.

32:14.224 --> 32:17.310
You thought that
you could use Patty to beat Magnolia.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.478
Screw Magnolia.

32:18.562 --> 32:21.231
- If the stick was any further up her...
- Hi.

32:21.314 --> 32:24.276
Mr. Armstrong. Mrs. Armstrong.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.404
- Magnolia.
- Wow, look, what are the odds?

32:27.487 --> 32:28.530
I work here.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.491
Those are pretty good odds.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.492
All right, well,

32:32.576 --> 32:35.620
I'm gonna get going now.
Will you have your mother call me?

32:35.704 --> 32:37.539
I wanna talk about Junior League.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.584
Actually, I'll just call her myself.
You look beautiful.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.419
And you, I love you.

I'm sorry about what I said,

32:49.676 --> 32:50.886
But, I agree with you.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.180
Especially the stuff you said
about my dad.

32:54.764 --> 32:58.101
But do you... really think I'm stuck up?

33:00.479 --> 33:04.608
I think it must be tough,
living up to your father's expectations.

33:04.691 --> 33:07.235
That is something
I can relate to very much.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.780
You know what would
really piss off my dad?

33:11.948 --> 33:14.242

[all] Hi, John.

When I first came in here,
I never thought I'd last a day.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.203
I lost my job, my home.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.750
But, I didn't admit I had a problem
until I punched a fat girl in the face.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.837
And I don't know
if I'll ever forgive myself.

Oh, no.

Thank you. I, uh...

That is older than you are.

Um, come upstairs, I wanna show you
my wardrobe for Miss Magic Jesus.

it was probably a bad idea</i>

Nice. That is perfect for your body type.

I don't know... Can I show you?

35:48.521 --> 35:49.439
Look at him.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.567
He thinks he can hurt me
and then have me arrested

35:52.651 --> 35:54.736
and then just move on with his life?

35:55.779 --> 35:56.613
No.

I'm gonna screw that guy.

I don't think that's a thing.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.718
I'm gonna sleep with him
and he's going to be so in love with me.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.554
And I'm going to reject him
and he's gonna be crushed.

36:21.638 --> 36:22.681
It'll be epic.
