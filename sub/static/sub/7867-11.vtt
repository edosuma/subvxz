01:55.500 --> 01:57.237
Three, two, one.

01:57.277 --> 01:59.013
Happy new year!

01:59.292 --> 02:00.590
Of school!

02:03.205 --> 02:04.370
What are you doing?

02:04.455 --> 02:07.100
It's the first day of school!

02:07.300 --> 02:09.359
You're the government's problem now!

02:09.473 --> 02:10.473
Yeah!

02:11.890 --> 02:14.946
Free at last. Free at last.

02:15.444 --> 02:17.980
I can't believe we have to start
another year of school.

02:17.985 --> 02:20.035
I never learned anything
at that suckshack.

02:20.245 --> 02:21.458
Who taught you that language?

02:21.534 --> 02:22.534
Kid at school.

02:22.412 --> 02:24.120
So you did learn something.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.481
Homie, the insurance bill is due today.

02:26.632 --> 02:27.888
Can you make sure to mail it?

02:29.099 --> 02:31.886
Absolutely! Insurance is
the greatest deal ever.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.680
If I get hurt, I get paid.

02:33.775 --> 02:35.968
And man, do I get hurt.

02:48.452 --> 02:49.460
Easy...

03:08.325 --> 03:08.903
What is it?

03:26.700 --> 03:28.034
What a week!

03:32.525 --> 03:33.961
Welcome to another school year!

03:34.217 --> 03:35.096
One important note:

03:35.275 --> 03:37.590
The flower-based names
of the reading groups...

03:37.591 --> 03:39.418
are now barnyard-based.

03:39.806 --> 03:41.536
Mr. Becker has protested the move...

03:41.693 --> 03:44.300
so his group will remain the Daffodils.

03:45.347 --> 03:49.392
Where my Dils at?

03:50.500 --> 03:51.869
I never tire of that.

03:52.161 --> 03:53.326
One other announcement:

03:53.395 --> 03:55.957
At the end of the month,
we'll be participating in the...

03:56.131 --> 03:58.219
Vice-President's Assessment Test.

03:58.451 --> 03:59.507
He stinks!

03:59.759 --> 04:01.872
We're assessing you, not him.

04:02.116 --> 04:02.957
Withdrawn.

04:03.214 --> 04:05.074
The VPAT is part of the
federal government's...

04:05.239 --> 04:06.912
"No Child Left Alone" act.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.739
It will be a rewarding day of pencil sharpening
and "eyes on your own paper" keeping.

04:10.912 --> 04:12.912
Cut the horse bull Seymour!

04:13.079 --> 04:14.628
Your scores on this test...

04:14.746 --> 04:18.622
will determine how much money this
suckshack gets for years to come.

04:18.850 --> 04:21.624
So we will spend every moment
of the next two weeks...

04:21.822 --> 04:26.502
drilling the questions and answers
into your soft little skulls.

04:26.819 --> 04:30.308
Shy is to Gregarious

04:30.482 --> 04:35.400
As peaceful is to bellicose

04:41.036 --> 04:41.806
Children.

04:41.828 --> 04:43.784
the answers of the
standardized test fall into...

04:43.962 --> 04:45.820
12 basic patterns.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.848
Read after me:
Accaca-Dabacca-Accacaca.

04:50.242 --> 04:52.590
Accaca-Dabacca-Accacaca.

04:52.596 --> 04:55.500
Number two:
Dacacca-Adada-Badacad.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.108
Dacacca-Adada-Badacad.

05:00.887 --> 05:01.800
Biggest city in Montana?

05:02.004 --> 05:02.519
Helena?

05:02.737 --> 05:03.550
Wrong!

05:04.200 --> 05:05.705
912 divided by 6?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.400
You can't teach this way!

05:07.475 --> 05:08.356
Yes, I can!

05:08.931 --> 05:09.931
Pretty sure this works!

05:10.738 --> 05:12.623
Where are these studies conducted?

05:12.625 --> 05:13.625
Ball State.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.600
So when you take your practice test,

05:16.643 --> 05:19.000
take your number two pencil, and...

05:19.296 --> 05:20.800
What kind of pencil do we take again?

05:21.112 --> 05:23.181
Number two, take a number two.

05:24.922 --> 05:26.425
Looks like you took a big number two.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.884
Yes, quite so. As you can see,
I'm holding a big number two in my hands.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.802
enjoying the weight and feel of it.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.835
Whoo-hoo! Test day at last!

05:48.099 --> 05:50.343
Now I can show-off on the federal level!

05:50.591 --> 05:52.087
Hey Bart, on the practice test yesterday,

05:52.249 --> 05:55.905
what did you pick as the best title for
the paragraph about manifest destiny?

05:55.947 --> 05:57.061
Slurt my snot.

05:58.677 --> 06:01.075
I wrote "slurt my snot" in
the ovals on the answer sheet.

06:01.365 --> 06:01.796
True story.

06:02.093 --> 06:04.782
Dad! Bart's throwing away his future!

06:05.132 --> 06:08.528
Oh no, now who will
sell oranges on the off-ramp?

06:12.060 --> 06:13.756
Great jokes make me hungry.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.168
I wonder what's in the pantry.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.038
Wait a minute...

06:29.968 --> 06:31.583
Wait a minute!

06:39.958 --> 06:42.815
Bart, we need to talk to you
about your practice test.

06:44.785 --> 06:46.791
I warned you.

06:47.029 --> 06:48.703
You got a perfect score.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.909
Wonderful job, son.
Just stellar.

06:54.076 --> 06:54.855
How did I do?

06:54.992 --> 06:55.635
96.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.981
What did I get wrong?

06:57.161 --> 06:57.985
Several answers.

06:58.142 --> 07:00.200
Several? That's more than a few,

07:00.395 --> 07:01.493
and almost a bunch!

07:01.715 --> 07:04.442
Bart, because of your superior intellect...

07:04.528 --> 07:06.795
But, wait! I aced the math
part right? Because I...

07:10.519 --> 07:13.386
Bart, you and the other
perfect-scoring superstars...

07:13.620 --> 07:16.559
are exempt from taking
the actual test today.

07:16.642 --> 07:17.564
No test?!

07:17.896 --> 07:22.251
Don't be too disappointed. We are
throwing you a pizza-party at a bowling alley.

07:22.488 --> 07:23.700
Well, it's about time.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.672
Come, your helicopter awaits.

07:34.558 --> 07:37.588
Check it out! Bart's a superstar, too!

07:37.761 --> 07:38.761
- Bart's here!
- Awesome!

07:39.284 --> 07:41.200
Wait a minute.
This ain't no genius-copter.

07:41.270 --> 07:42.619
This is con-air!

07:43.904 --> 07:45.100
Take it away, Willie!

07:47.826 --> 07:49.704
Enjoy your flight!

07:49.810 --> 07:53.400
Brilliant plan to remove all
the underperformers for test day, sir.

07:53.568 --> 07:55.662
Yes. All of them.

07:56.026 --> 08:00.500
Why Seymour, it seems I left
my sunglasses on the bus.

07:59.978 --> 08:01.202
Well I'd best retrieve them.

08:01.661 --> 08:03.338
Yes, yes. You'd best.

08:05.747 --> 08:06.700
Sir?

08:07.599 --> 08:09.801
So long, superstars!

08:18.800 --> 08:22.313
Can't believe it.
Superintendent Chalmers betrayed me.

08:22.523 --> 08:25.803
After all the wrapping paper
I bought from his daughter.

08:26.212 --> 08:28.162
Pizza party, pizza party!

08:28.323 --> 08:31.096
Helicopter, helicopter!

08:31.337 --> 08:32.918
Stop it, all of you!

08:33.092 --> 08:34.265
What's the matter, superstar?

08:34.436 --> 08:36.299
Feeling sorry for the normals?

08:36.535 --> 08:38.905
Don't you get it?
There is no pizza party!

08:39.145 --> 08:40.871
This isn't a helicopter!

08:41.068 --> 08:42.700
No pizza party?

08:42.736 --> 08:44.010
Not a helicopter?

08:50.700 --> 08:51.825
Let me explain it to you...

08:51.858 --> 08:54.259
in terms even
the simplest can understand.

08:54.479 --> 08:56.700
We're hiding you in
capital city for the day...

08:57.088 --> 08:59.581
so your numbskullary won't
drag down the test scores...

08:59.741 --> 09:01.545
of the children who are our future.

09:01.731 --> 09:02.330
Told you.

09:02.571 --> 09:03.927
Will there be other numbskulls there?

09:04.276 --> 09:06.631
Sort of a numbskull Olympics as it were?

09:06.654 --> 09:07.844
Let's all act stupid!

09:11.525 --> 09:12.837
Guys, guys, save it for the competition!

09:17.526 --> 09:18.532
ID please.

09:19.656 --> 09:20.656
Must be in the glove box.

09:26.464 --> 09:27.754
This was due two weeks ago!

09:27.941 --> 09:28.993
I'm uninsured!

09:29.781 --> 09:33.888
For the first time in my life,
I'm financially responsible for my own actions!

09:34.528 --> 09:35.868
Uninsured, uninsured!

09:36.563 --> 09:37.254
Idiot!

09:38.264 --> 09:40.000
I'm not in good hands. I'm in no hands!

09:40.389 --> 09:42.217
Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!

09:44.413 --> 09:47.265
Dear stupid insurance company,

09:47.652 --> 09:50.663
I meant to mail this...

09:51.117 --> 09:52.237
on time.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.481
What do you mean too bad?

09:55.749 --> 09:57.492
Screw you!

09:57.833 --> 09:59.113
Heh heh.

10:04.708 --> 10:06.870
Oh, I won't be insured until two o'clock!

10:07.326 --> 10:09.768
Okay, until then, I have to
avoid any serious injuries...

10:10.130 --> 10:11.400
or accidents on my property.

10:11.496 --> 10:12.496
Or I'm ruined.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.198
Oh no you don't!

10:20.573 --> 10:24.563
Now, I know some of you
may suffer from test anxiety.

10:24.945 --> 10:26.099
Here's a helpful hint.

10:26.294 --> 10:29.194
Imagine each question is a baby chick.

10:29.532 --> 10:32.532
If you answer wrong, the chick dies.

10:34.063 --> 10:35.752
Shut up, they would've died anyway.

10:36.018 --> 10:39.800
Now the test will begin in 5... 4... 3...

10:39.937 --> 10:43.552
Oh, my God, we should've begun
four minutes ago. Go, go, go!

10:45.181 --> 10:46.221
You can do it, Lisa.

10:46.403 --> 10:48.980
There's nothing in the room
but you and the test.

11:09.750 --> 11:10.780
Focus.

11:13.543 --> 11:15.016
Pride is to downfall

11:15.198 --> 11:17.198
as overconfidence is to.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.053
What? They're all equally valid.

11:24.595 --> 11:27.498
That can't be! In life,
everything only has one answer!

11:29.533 --> 11:31.195
Piece of cake, huh?

11:32.564 --> 11:35.354
Ah, I'm writing on my shirt!

11:40.809 --> 11:42.460
Hey Seymour, I just realized something.

11:42.488 --> 11:44.800
You're stuck babysitting us losers,

11:44.820 --> 11:46.781
which makes you the real loser.

11:48.674 --> 11:50.094
For your information, I am not a loser.

11:50.235 --> 11:53.073
I am a successful principal
who paints houses in the summertime.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.290
You painted our garage and
it was peeling by October!

11:56.565 --> 11:59.441
Your dad insisted I use an inferior primer.

11:59.674 --> 12:01.600
Loser! Loser!

12:01.653 --> 12:03.599
Excuse me, Mommy, I have to go potty.

12:04.643 --> 12:05.878
Otto, can you pull over?

12:07.307 --> 12:08.212
Pull over!

12:09.071 --> 12:10.847
Sorry. I was mesmerized
by the little boy's dance.

12:15.337 --> 12:24.570
*Wannabe - Spice Girls*

12:24.757 --> 12:26.400
Ralph, are you almost finished?

12:26.438 --> 12:28.106
I finished before we came in.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.394
All right, now we can
get back on the bus, and...

12:35.827 --> 12:36.943
All aboard!

12:37.437 --> 12:40.245
Hey Skinner, wanna see our impression of you?

12:40.300 --> 12:42.836
Well, I guess I can use
an affectionate homage.

12:46.428 --> 12:47.957
All right, stay calm boys.

12:48.169 --> 12:51.844
Oh, God. We're at the corner of Cesar Chavez Way
and Martin Luther King Boulevard.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.498
¡Ay, caramba!

12:56.572 --> 12:58.780
Homie, what are you doing home so early?

12:58.947 --> 13:00.379
Marge, I won't bore you with the truth.

13:00.565 --> 13:02.141
All I can say is that until 3 P.M.,

13:02.180 --> 13:06.190
we must avoid all accidents and injuries,
or we're all going to the poor house.

13:06.198 --> 13:08.575
You mean back to the poor house.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.090
Fine, back.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.990
And we can't let anyone else
get hurt on our property.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.080
I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.

13:15.241 --> 13:17.183
Me too, baby, but we gotta get real.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.500
We can discuss it later.

13:18.524 --> 13:21.361
Right now, while you're here,
you can help host my book club.

13:21.744 --> 13:26.200
Book club? That's the most stupid boring
thing ever! Oh, thank you.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.450
Now, I would never say a bad word
about Cletus and Brandine,

13:33.452 --> 13:37.022
but I hear he's been feeding
slop to another woman's pig!

13:44.839 --> 13:46.484
I've been cleaved!

13:47.896 --> 13:50.120
Oh, my God, oh, my God, we're totally liable!

13:54.845 --> 13:56.500
Oh, yeah...

13:58.297 --> 14:00.204
I mean, no!

14:04.585 --> 14:06.351
Maybe I should just move onto question two.

14:06.963 --> 14:09.739
Question two: using what
you learnt in question one...

14:13.700 --> 14:16.722
Lisa, like Captain Kurk,
I'm not supposed to interfere.

14:17.002 --> 14:19.820
But like TJ Hooker,
I say what's on my mind.

14:19.933 --> 14:22.043
If you don't know the answer, just guess.

14:22.273 --> 14:24.400
This test penalizes guessing!

14:24.450 --> 14:25.676
It does?

14:25.624 --> 14:26.880
All right, nobody guess!

14:27.097 --> 14:28.445
Just be right!

14:28.645 --> 14:29.900
Get down on your knees,

14:29.918 --> 14:31.800
pray to your God,

14:31.818 --> 14:34.336
and ask him-- no demand he tell you the answer.

14:34.514 --> 14:37.136
And if he won't, he is no God of yours!

14:39.636 --> 14:41.277
What's your plan now, Skinrash?

14:41.636 --> 14:43.870
My name isn't Skinrash, it's Principal Skinner!

14:43.877 --> 14:46.055
And you will address me as such!

14:46.216 --> 14:47.200
Sure thing, Such.

14:47.491 --> 14:49.500
I'll deal with your insubordinate wordplay later.

14:49.517 --> 14:52.482
My first duty is to get you boys to safety,
and that's... Where's Ralph?

14:55.738 --> 14:57.025
I'm playing with Elmo!

15:06.708 --> 15:11.830
Okay. I just have to keep these
tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds.

15:14.109 --> 15:17.805
Van Johnson was never half the man
Van Heflin was.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.300
Knife!

15:51.280 --> 15:52.300
Apaches!

15:53.222 --> 15:57.300
Oh, Mr. Burns. Why do
terrible things always happen...

15:57.340 --> 15:59.700
to wonderful people at 3:01 P.M.

15:59.711 --> 16:01.235
Which, for the record, is the correct time.

16:08.903 --> 16:09.903
So...

16:10.691 --> 16:11.691
Planning for the weekend?

16:13.028 --> 16:16.131
Marge, are you mad I forgot
to send in the payment?

16:16.416 --> 16:17.730
No, sweetie.

16:17.881 --> 16:21.849
At this point in a marriage, a wife should know
what her husband can do and what he can't.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.310
Who was I to think you can mail an envelope?

16:24.540 --> 16:27.259
Baby, I hope you've got snuggle insurance...

16:27.411 --> 16:29.861
'cos I'm about to file a claim.

16:44.454 --> 16:46.000
- Bart, do you have your slingshot?
- No, sir.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.305
I see it in your backpocket.

16:47.576 --> 16:48.715
Just don't stretch it out.

16:49.012 --> 16:50.737
I was once a boy, and like all boys...

16:51.147 --> 16:52.660
You like all boys?

16:53.404 --> 16:57.395
Shut up!
I child is in danger under my aegis!

17:20.613 --> 17:21.935
Run, Ralph! Run!

17:22.026 --> 17:23.026
Okay.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.768
Time to do what I've never done as principal:

17:30.800 --> 17:32.000
Something.

17:38.888 --> 17:40.518
Skinner's spazzing out!

17:40.713 --> 17:41.800
I'm not spazzing out.

17:42.641 --> 17:46.495
I'm using the principal of conservation of
angular momentum to turn the container!

17:50.348 --> 17:53.373
That is so cool! That's the kind
of stuff they should teach in school!

17:53.800 --> 17:54.930
We do teach it in school.

17:55.097 --> 17:57.668
You're too busy eating
sugar snacks and horsing around!

17:57.895 --> 18:00.200
He's right. Learning can teach you things.

18:00.407 --> 18:01.903
Education rules.

18:13.950 --> 18:17.200
But I reckon I gotta light out for
the territory ahead of the rest.

18:17.209 --> 18:20.781
Because Aunt Sally, she's gonna adapt me,
and civilize me,

18:20.971 --> 18:22.547
and I can't stand it.

18:22.992 --> 18:24.575
I've been there before.

18:24.715 --> 18:26.120
That book was awesome!

18:27.375 --> 18:30.075
Next stop: Springfield Elementary!

18:30.914 --> 18:31.890
Skinner!

18:32.185 --> 18:33.185
Otto! Me bullies!

18:34.333 --> 18:35.600
The cowerbunger kid!

18:35.873 --> 18:38.164
And a real nitwit!

18:38.362 --> 18:40.174
It's so good to see you all!

18:45.887 --> 18:50.410
All done. And I've got two minutes
to take care of these stray marks.

18:52.331 --> 18:53.200
Well, that's it.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.200
The test is almost over, and I haven't done a thing.

18:56.606 --> 18:57.843
I've blown my whole future.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.000
Right.

18:59.021 --> 19:03.020
Oh, well. Maybe it'll be
more fun to be a regular,

19:03.020 --> 19:05.940
average, stay-at-home...

19:06.718 --> 19:08.363
This test is a joke!

19:09.798 --> 19:10.434
Skinner?!

19:10.760 --> 19:14.703
Today, I received an education in how children really learn:

19:14.941 --> 19:18.900
By seeing their principal run around
on top of a shipping container.

19:19.272 --> 19:21.330
So children, put down your answer sheet.

19:21.519 --> 19:23.376
And drop that number two.

19:25.115 --> 19:26.448
Yes, I know what that means.

19:26.552 --> 19:27.980
I've learned so much today.

19:28.284 --> 19:31.253
This is my school, and I'm throwing out the test.

19:33.432 --> 19:36.700
Hurray! I'm a brainy outcast again!

19:36.727 --> 19:38.526
And finally, effective immediately,

19:38.701 --> 19:40.991
I'm overturning this school's ban on dancing.

19:41.229 --> 19:48.229
