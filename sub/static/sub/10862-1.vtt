 "If thou wilt cut off

00:30.960 --> 00:33.000
"the heads of thy two children

00:33.000 --> 00:39.320
"and besmear me with their blood, 
 I shall receive life again."

00:39.320 --> 00:41.040
"Besmear me"?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.880
That's disgusting.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.560
Fairy tales?

00:50.560 --> 00:52.320
Weak, Kris. Very weak.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.800
Weak? 
 Have you ever read these things?

00:56.800 --> 00:58.920
Not the Wimpy versions-- 
 the original ones.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.840
Ah, no. 
 Can't say I have.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.280
[Gary] 
 I have.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.160
They're full of stabbings 
 and demons

01:05.160 --> 01:06.600
and man-eating animals

01:06.600 --> 01:10.560
and cutting off limbs 
 and what not-- cool stuff.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.400
My favorite's the one where 
 the old man kidnaps the prince

01:15.400 --> 01:18.800
and puts blood on the queen's 
 mouth while she sleeps

01:18.800 --> 01:21.680
to make the king think she ate him.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.040
That's so gross. 
 I love it!

01:24.040 --> 01:25.600
I'm not buying it.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.880
A kiddie story's a kiddie story, 
 no matter how you cut it.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.560
Oh, man, 
 you're not going to tell

01:29.560 --> 01:31.400
some tired old fairy tale, 
 are you?

01:31.400 --> 01:32.920
[Kristen] 
 Not exactly.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.480
The story I'm going to tell is 
 about a girl who loved fairy tales.

01:37.480 --> 01:41.920
She had a huge collection. 
 She knew most of them by heart.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.160
But the trouble was, 
 she spent so much time

01:45.160 --> 01:47.520
thinking about the world 
 of make-believe

01:47.520 --> 01:50.120
that she started to forget 
 the difference

01:50.120 --> 01:55.120
between reality and imagination, 
 and when you do that,

01:55.120 --> 02:02.360
a fairy tale can soon become 
 a scary tale.

02:07.640 --> 02:12.520
Submitted for the Approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

02:12.520 --> 02:15.040
I call this story...

02:23.440 --> 02:25.480
Go ahead, my dear.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.880
Have a taste.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.360
Such a pretty apple.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.400
You must take a bite, 
 for if you don't, I'll have to...

02:36.400 --> 02:38.760
force you to eat it!

02:38.760 --> 02:40.720
Ah ha ha ha!

03:26.080 --> 03:28.720
You got to grow up, Jill.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.320
This is stupid.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.080
There's nothing under there.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.720
Aah!

03:57.000 --> 03:59.920
Mom, Dad-- the bed! 
 There's something there!

03:59.920 --> 04:01.960
Something under the bed-- 
 it grabbed me!

04:01.960 --> 04:03.280
Oh, Jill, not again.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.960
I swear it! 
 It grabbed me!

04:04.960 --> 04:09.280
- Oh, honey, it was a dream. 
 - Oh, it wasn't!

04:13.760 --> 04:15.480
I sat on the bed,

04:15.480 --> 04:18.040
and these green, 
 nasty-looking, scaly hands

04:18.040 --> 04:21.000
reached out and tried 
 to pull me under.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.520
I'm not kidding. 
 Look!

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
Aah!

04:34.560 --> 04:36.320
Mmm.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.760
Didn't we have this last week?

04:38.760 --> 04:40.960
Don't make fun of me.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.480
[boy] 
 What's going on?

04:42.480 --> 04:44.720
Nothing. 
 Jill had a nightmare.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.760
It wasn't a nightmare. 
 There was something under there.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.480
Jill, we all have nightmares.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.880
You just can't take them 
 so seriously.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.960
Go back to bed.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.880
- Got you. 
 - It was you?

05:00.880 --> 05:01.880
Mom!

05:03.680 --> 05:06.960
Come on. 
 Don't be such a snitch.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.480
I hate you! 
 Why did you do that?

05:09.480 --> 05:12.240
I thought you wanted to 
 find something under the bed.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.600
- You're always looking. 
 - Why don't you just grow up?

05:15.600 --> 05:18.960
Me? You're the one who's 
 still living in a fairtland, princess.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.520
You're 13 years old. 
 Listen to the radio.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.640
Go to a concert or something.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.440
Stop being a kid, 
 and maybe you won't be scared

05:27.440 --> 05:29.680
or bogeymen under the bed anymore.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.960
Sweet dreams.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.880
Jill, come on!

05:37.880 --> 05:40.440
You're going to miss the bus.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.520
Jill, don't do this again.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.960
I'm coming.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.240
[Kirsten] 
 Jill was having a rough time.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.600
Everyone kept telling her 
 to "grow up" and "act your age,"

05:50.600 --> 05:53.720
but she didn't know 
 how to grow up any faster,

05:53.720 --> 05:55.520
and she wasn't exactly sure

05:55.520 --> 05:57.880
how kids her age 
 were supposed to act.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.480
- Yuck. 
 - I can't wait. Adios!

06:00.480 --> 06:03.120
Jill, I am not going 
 to call you again!

06:03.120 --> 06:05.640
- I'm late. 
 - Why does she always do this?

06:05.640 --> 06:07.520
I don't know, but if 
 she missed the bus again,

06:07.520 --> 06:09.000
it's your turn to drive her.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.400
- But-- 
 - Bye.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.520
Jill, I am not going 
 to be late for work.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.160
I'm coming!

06:25.000 --> 06:27.880
- Sorry. 
 - Why do you do this?

06:27.880 --> 06:30.400
All I ask is that you 
 get up and out on time.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.840
Now I'm going to have 
 to drive you to school,

06:32.840 --> 06:35.000
and I'm going to be 
 late for work again.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.960
- I told you I'm sorry. 
 - Don't ignore me.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.520
You are going to have to 
 learn some responsibility, miss.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.160
Other people live in this house,

06:43.160 --> 06:46.320
and we're getting tired of 
 putting up with your childishness.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.040
Come on.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.320
[Kristen] 
 Jill kind of understood

06:58.320 --> 07:01.360
why her family 
 was getting angry,

07:01.360 --> 07:04.440
but her friends weren't 
 helping much, either.

07:09.080 --> 07:09.800
[sigh]

07:13.360 --> 07:15.400
He's so fine.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.400
I'd talk to him, but 
 I'd probably drool or something.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.000
Aren't you guys 
 being kind of obvious?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.080
We're just looking.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.760
Yeah-- 
 like a couple of silly gooses.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.840
Silly gooses?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.200
My grandmother says that.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.720
Did you see that?

07:40.720 --> 07:42.800
He checked her out! 
 Did he check her out?

07:42.800 --> 07:45.560
No way. 
 He wouldn't check out a geek.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.280
Look at this-- Grimmes' 
 Fairy Tales, Mother Goose,

07:51.280 --> 07:54.800
the Sandman and other tales. 
 What is with her?

07:54.800 --> 07:57.760
Is she, like, 
 a baby or something?

07:59.280 --> 08:02.400
Talk about us! 
 We saw you flirt with him.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.840
I didn't! 
 I had to sharpen my pencil.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.800
Yeah, right.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.520
He's coming. He's coming.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.720
- Hey, Jill. 
 - Hi.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.520
You have that reading 
 assignment

08:15.520 --> 08:17.640
Kelly gave us yesterday? 
 I lost it someplace.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.440
[Jill] 
 Sure.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.640
This what you're supposed 
 to read?

08:24.640 --> 08:27.680
- Hey! 
 - These are really interesting.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.360
You reading these?

08:29.360 --> 08:32.520
Yeah. No. 
 I have to do a book report.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.480
- On what-- Humpty Dumpty? 
 - [boy] Hey, trolls!

08:35.480 --> 08:38.640
I used to play with these 
 when I was a kid.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.240
Jill plays with them now.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.640
Get out of here. 
 Really?

08:44.280 --> 08:46.840
Hey, Jill, 
 you forgot your doll.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.960
[Kristen] Jill knew 
 she was being kind of childish,

08:52.960 --> 08:55.120
but there was something 
 inside her

08:55.120 --> 08:57.880
that didn't want to give up 
 the world of fairy tales,

08:57.880 --> 09:00.960
because in all those stories, 
 no matter how bad things got,

09:00.960 --> 09:03.360
everyone always lived 
 happily ever after,

09:03.360 --> 09:06.720
and the princess 
 always got the prince.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.160
I've come to awaken you, 
 Sleeping Beauty.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.760
- Grrr! 
 - Aah!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.640
- Oh, Jill, it's me. 
 - Why did you do that?

09:18.640 --> 09:21.800
I got this for Halloween, 
 and I just wanted to show you.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.280
You did not. You wanted 
 to scare me again.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.920
No, really, I didn't mean--

09:25.920 --> 09:28.360
Yes, you did! I hate you! 
 I hate all of you!

09:28.360 --> 09:30.680
I'm sorry! Geez, don't 
 get so bent out of shape.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.560
Get out of here! 
 Leave me alone!

09:32.560 --> 09:35.080
No sweat. I'm gone.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.280
What's so wrong about 
 wanting to live in a world

09:54.280 --> 09:58.440
where dreams come true 
 and you can wish on a star?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.480
I wish I could,

10:01.480 --> 10:04.840
and I wish everybody 
 would just leave me alone.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.120
[ticking]

10:35.520 --> 10:38.120
Jon! 
 That's it, I'm telling!

10:38.120 --> 10:40.200
You're going to get it!

10:49.000 --> 10:51.280
I'm sorry, but Jon is--

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
Mom?

11:01.920 --> 11:02.920
Dad?

11:04.840 --> 11:07.160
Are you down there?

11:15.640 --> 11:16.640
Jon?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.600
Come out, will you?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.720
[rustling]

11:22.920 --> 11:24.520
You are such a slime.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.760
If you think that you're 
 going to scare me again--

11:27.760 --> 11:32.120
- Hi, there! 
 - Aah!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.600
Aah!

11:38.600 --> 11:39.360
No!

11:50.760 --> 11:51.840
[ticking]

12:06.760 --> 12:08.600
Hello?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.120
Hello?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.360
Excuse me.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.400
I got to be dreaming.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.800
[snoring]

13:43.680 --> 13:46.880
Don't touch that! 
 You'll ruin everything!

13:46.880 --> 13:48.680
Who-- who are you?

13:48.680 --> 13:51.720
Who do you think I am? 
 Take a guess.

13:51.720 --> 13:55.200
- You're the guy under my bed. 
 - That's it?

13:55.200 --> 13:59.280
My entire persona described as 
 "that guy under your bed"?

13:59.280 --> 14:03.200
I think you can do 
 a little better than that.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.200
This is a dream.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.320
I've got to be dreaming.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.240
You're getting warmer, 
 but you're only half-right.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.640
This place is a dream, 
 but you're not dreaming.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.400
I don't like riddles.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.320
"The strangest things 
 I've are there for me,

14:18.320 --> 14:21.200
"both things to eat 
 and things to see.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.640
"And many frightening 
 sights abroad

14:23.640 --> 14:26.080
till morning in the Land of Nod."

14:26.080 --> 14:30.640
Stop it. I'm scared, and 
 I want to know where I am.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.680
Oh, all right. You're no fun.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.840
Young Miss, 
 you're in the Land of Nod,

14:35.840 --> 14:37.640
where everyone goes to dream.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.040
Land of Nod? 
 And who are you?

14:40.040 --> 14:42.000
Uh, isn't it obvious?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.240
I'm the Sandman...

14:45.280 --> 14:47.960
and this is my home.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.240
The Sandman.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.240
Like, the guy who puts 
 sand in your eyes

14:51.240 --> 14:53.360
to make you go to sleep?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.480
At your serivce. 
 Thank you.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.640
But that's a fairy tale.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.920
Exactly. 
 Now we're getting somewhere.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.840
Excuse me.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.320
[snoring]

15:12.320 --> 15:13.070
Oh!

15:13.840 --> 15:17.120
- Needs more snooze. 
 - I don't believe you.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.760
I don't believe any of this. 
 It's a joke.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.680
- It's... it's just... 
 - It's, uh, what you wished for.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.680
- What? 
 - Here's the scene.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.760
You took my book, 
 clutched it to your chest,

15:30.760 --> 15:33.240
looked out at the first 
 star, and said,

15:33.240 --> 15:35.720
"What's so wrong 
 about wanting to live

15:35.720 --> 15:37.840
"in a place when dreams come true,

15:37.840 --> 15:39.800
"where you can wish 
 upon a star?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.280
"I wish I could,

15:41.280 --> 15:44.040
and I wish everybody 
 would leave me alone."

15:44.040 --> 15:46.560
Sound familiar?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.920
No. No way.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.120
Yes way! 
 You're in your own fairy tale.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.800
Would you like to see 
 how it comes out?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.000
Yes!

15:55.000 --> 15:56.600
Sorry. 
 That would be cheating.

15:56.600 --> 16:00.040
- I want to go home. 
 - Uh...

16:00.040 --> 16:03.160
Sorry. 
 That's not what happens.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.800
Besides, 
 fairy tales can't be changed.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.280
Where's my family? 
 Did you take them, too?

16:09.280 --> 16:11.120
Don't worry. They're here.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.320
They won't bother you anymore, 
 just like you wished.

16:14.320 --> 16:17.760
- No. I'm going home. 
 - You can't. That's reality.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.720
You wanted a fairy tale, 
 remember?

16:19.720 --> 16:22.800
No, I don't. 
 I want to go home.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.560
Then maybe you should have 
 been a little bit more careful

16:27.560 --> 16:30.040
about what you wished for.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.400
Ha ha ha ha!

16:34.960 --> 16:37.880
[Sandman laughing]

16:47.240 --> 16:50.480
[Sandman] 
 I don't think so. Ha ha ha!

16:51.840 --> 16:55.400
[Sandman laughing]

17:03.160 --> 17:05.400
[Sandman] 
 Hoo hoo hoo!

17:06.599 --> 17:09.000
Like to try another fairy tale?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.480
They're all so much fun.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.319
Off with her head!

17:20.319 --> 17:21.319
Aah!

17:24.000 --> 17:25.560
[Sandman] 
 Ha ha ha ha!

17:25.560 --> 17:28.079
Didn't like that fairy tale?

17:28.079 --> 17:30.640
Try another. Ha ha ha ha!

17:30.640 --> 17:32.560
Hoo hoo hoo!

17:34.040 --> 17:39.120
I was expecting Hansel and Gretel, 
 but you'll do nicely.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.080
Come closer, my dear.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.400
Ah ha ha ha!

17:44.400 --> 17:46.960
[Sandman] 
 Maybe you should have left

17:46.960 --> 17:49.040
a trail of breadcrumbs,

17:49.040 --> 17:53.400
or maybe you should stick 
 with your own fairy tale.

18:00.120 --> 18:00.840
Stacy?

18:02.160 --> 18:04.640
Stacy, wake up!

18:07.680 --> 18:09.520
Rick?

18:10.480 --> 18:13.400
Jon, wake up. 
 You got to wake--

18:16.800 --> 18:20.600
- [Sandman laughing] 
 - [Jill] No!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.680
I didn't want this!

18:22.680 --> 18:25.200
This isn't what I wished for!

18:26.360 --> 18:28.320
[Sandman] 
 Yes, you did!

18:29.400 --> 18:33.000
Welcome to your fairy tale. 
 Ha ha ha ha!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.800
Aah!

18:57.400 --> 18:59.880
I want to go home!

19:02.040 --> 19:05.240
I'll break it! I swear!

19:06.640 --> 19:09.560
Put it down, Jill. 
 You don't know what you're doing.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.880
You send me home,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.240
and send my family 
 and friends home, too.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.320
I can't. 
 Fairy tales can't be changed.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.680
They are what they are. 
 Now, leave it alone!

19:20.040 --> 19:22.360
Not until you let us go.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.120
But you wanted everyone 
 to live happily ever after.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.000
They'll sleep peacefully 
 forever in the Land of Nod.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.800
They're prisoners, 
 and so am I.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.600
This isn't the way your family 
 tale's supposed to end,

19:33.600 --> 19:37.760
but if insist on being foolish, 
 I'll have to put you to sleep, too.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.120
What?

19:41.120 --> 19:44.320
So the fairy tale can 
 be changed, after all.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.720
I didn't say that.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.600
Yes, you did. 
 It's my fairy tale,

19:47.600 --> 19:49.680
and if you can change it, 
 so can I.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.720
Please, put that down!

19:50.720 --> 19:53.720
And I'm going to close the book!

19:53.720 --> 19:54.470
No!

19:56.680 --> 19:58.880
Off with her...

19:58.880 --> 20:01.040
- Just like you... 
 - No!

20:01.040 --> 20:02.440
[Sandman laughing]

20:02.440 --> 20:06.240
- Ha ha ha! 
 - Aah!

20:06.240 --> 20:07.520
Jill?

20:07.520 --> 20:10.080
Jill, honey, 
 what's the matter?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.760
Yeah, now what?

20:15.200 --> 20:19.000
It-- it was a dream.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.440
It was all a dream.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.640
You were screaming. 
 Are you OK?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.920
No. She's not. 
 She's a nut case.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.200
Ha ha ha!

20:28.200 --> 20:31.480
- See? 
 - No. I'm fine.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.600
It was a stupid nightmare. 
 I'm sorry.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.400
It's OK, honey.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.080
Go back to sleep.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.280
[Jill] 
 Guys?

20:46.280 --> 20:49.880
I know I've been kind of a pain.

20:49.880 --> 20:55.040
I think it's time to start 
 giving up this fairy tale stuff.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.920
Hooray.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.040
That's fine, honey.

21:00.040 --> 21:04.080
Just don't give up on 
 the kid inside altogether, OK?

21:08.640 --> 21:11.560
I'm never going to get back to sleep.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.120
[Sandman] 
 The little girl went back to sleep,

21:57.120 --> 22:00.040
promising never to believe 
 in fairy tales again.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.520
If only she knew--

22:01.520 --> 22:04.920
she would have never 
 gone back in that bed again!

22:04.920 --> 22:08.560
Ha ha ha ha!

22:08.560 --> 22:10.520
The End.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.760
So...

22:13.760 --> 22:16.000
don't take fairy tales lightly.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.520
You never know 
 which ones are made up

22:19.520 --> 22:22.240
and which ones are real.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.560
Excellent.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.920
I just have one question.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.680
What?

22:30.680 --> 22:34.960
Where's the part about the kids 
 getting their heads chopped off?
