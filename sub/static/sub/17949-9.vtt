WENT WELL?

02:00.888 --> 02:02.723
- FANTASTIC.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.993
- YOU'RE LYING.
- ABSOLUTELY.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.197
- SO ARE WE ALL SET
FOR MY CABANA BIRTHDAY LUNCH?

02:09.197 --> 02:10.264
- YOU KNOW IT.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.899
- I GOT TO SAY,
I'M PRETTY EXCITED

02:11.899 --> 02:14.235
ABOUT THIS GIFT
YOU SAY I'M GONNA LOVE.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.338
- WELL, IT IS UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW
READY TO BE WRAPPED.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.806
- ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU AT 2:00?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.474
- DON'T BE LATE.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.216
I FORGOT JO'S BIRTHDAY!

02:28.216 --> 02:30.684
- HOW COULD YOU FORGET
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY?

02:30.684 --> 02:34.422
- I THOUGHT IT WAS THE 23RD,
BUT IT'S THE 21ST.

02:34.422 --> 02:37.525
23RD, 21ST;
THEY RHYME.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.559
- THEY DON'T RHYME.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.861
- NOW I CAN'T GET HER GIFT.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.029
I WAS GONNA
GET HER A GOLD NECKLACE,

02:42.029 --> 02:43.797
BUT WE DON'T GET PAID
UNTIL TOMORROW,

02:43.797 --> 02:45.999
AND RIGHT NOW,
I ONLY HAVE HALF THE MONEY.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.502
- THIS LOOKS LIKE
A JOB FOR SUPER FRIEND

02:48.502 --> 02:49.903
AND HIS POWER CARD.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.072
YOW!

02:52.072 --> 02:55.108
OKAY, LOOK, I'LL PUT HALF OF
THE NECKLACE ON MY DEBIT CARD,

02:55.108 --> 02:56.109
AND YOU CAN
PAY ME BACK TOMORROW.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.645
- OH, THANK YOU, BUDDY.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.714
- NO, THANK SUPER FRIEND.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.450
NOW...

03:02.450 --> 03:05.052
DOES ANYONE ELSE
NEED SUPER FRIEND'S HELP?

03:05.052 --> 03:07.588
- WE'LL BE FINE.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.789
- WE'RE ALMOST DONE SULKING

03:08.789 --> 03:10.624
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
GET OUR OWN GOLD RECORD.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.092
- CARRY ON.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.861
FRIENDSHIP AWAY!

03:13.861 --> 03:15.263
- PLEASE DON'T DO THAT
IN THE STORE.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.930
- WA-POW!

03:18.766 --> 03:20.167
- OKAY, ONE MORE SULK,

03:20.167 --> 03:25.306
CONSIDERING MY GOLD RECORD
COLLECTION IS SERIOUSLY LACKING.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.441
- NOW HOW AM I GONNA PLAY IT?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.842
- DUDE, YOU DON'T PLAY
A GOLD RECORD.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.077
IT'S JUST FOR DECORATION.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.712
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.447
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ONE?

03:33.447 --> 03:34.715
- NO.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.317
- AND YOU'RE NOT CURIOUS

03:36.317 --> 03:39.320
TO KNOW WHAT BIG TIME RUSH
SOUNDS LIKE IN GOLD?

03:43.991 --> 03:46.394
both: GOLD.

03:46.394 --> 03:50.331
- [mimicking lawn mower]

03:51.632 --> 03:53.434
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE FANCY JACKET?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.568
- SCHOOL PROJECT.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.803
WE HAVE TO CREATE A BUSINESS,

03:55.803 --> 03:58.739
SO I'M OPENING UP
A PSYCHOLOGY PRACTICE.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.040
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD CALL,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.310
THERE'S A LOT OF WEIRDOS
AROUND HERE.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.446
[mimicking leaf blower]

04:07.147 --> 04:09.082
[loud squishing]

04:09.082 --> 04:10.318
- WHAT WAS THAT?

04:20.561 --> 04:22.195
- THAT'S OIL.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.198
BLACK GOLD.
TEXAS TEA.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.535
DINO JUICE.
CAR SAUCE.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.536
BIG MAMA'S--

04:28.536 --> 04:30.938
- IT'S OIL.
I GET IT.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.109
AND I GOT AN IDEA
FOR A NEW SCHOOL BUSINESS...

04:39.179 --> 04:41.148
ONE THAT'S GOING
TO MAKE US RICH.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.453
[pump whirring]

04:48.589 --> 04:50.223
- DUDE,
I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.759
JO IS GOING TO LOVE THIS.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.494
- ALL IN A DAY'S WORK,
CITIZEN.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.364
- OKAY, NOW I JUST HAVE
TO RESERVE THE CABANA,

04:56.364 --> 04:57.631
GET BALLOONS, FOOD--

04:57.631 --> 05:00.200
OH!
AND I HAVE TO WRAP THE NECKLACE.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.735
- NEVER FEAR!

05:01.735 --> 05:03.437
SUPER FRIEND AND HIS
GIFT-WRAPPING POWERS

05:03.437 --> 05:04.872
WILL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.742
- SO YOU JUST GONNA KEEP UP WITH
THE SUPER FRIEND THING ALL DAY?

05:08.742 --> 05:10.277
- I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN.
WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

05:10.277 --> 05:12.179
- THANK YOU.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.948
HELLO, CAMILLE!

05:14.948 --> 05:16.384
- HEY, LOGAN, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED TO--

05:16.384 --> 05:18.586
[gasps]

05:18.586 --> 05:20.388
LOGAN MITCHELL,

05:20.388 --> 05:23.156
OH, YOU REMEMBERED
OUR 15-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.158
OH!
OH, GOD!

05:25.158 --> 05:28.128
I RUINED YOUR SURPRISE,
BUT IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.463
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT--

05:29.463 --> 05:31.799
- AND I WAS JUST SAYING
HOW YOU NEVER BUY ME ANYTHING,

05:31.799 --> 05:36.103
AND YOU GO AND BUY ME
THIS GOLD NECKLACE.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.038
OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU WERE SAYING?

05:39.239 --> 05:40.708
- HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

05:44.244 --> 05:48.248
- OKAY, NOW, HOW DO WE GET IT
OUT OF THE FRAME TO PLAY IT?

05:48.248 --> 05:50.618
- VERY CAREFULLY.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.653
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:52.653 --> 05:55.723
both: NOTHING.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.858
- WE'RE GONNA PLAY OUR GOLD
RECORD AND HEAR US IN GOLD.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.662
- WHAT?

06:01.662 --> 06:04.064
- GUYS, IT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ANYTHING.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.734
- DO YOU KNOW THAT FOR SURE?

06:06.734 --> 06:08.669
HAVE YOU EVER
PLAYED A GOLD RECORD?

06:08.669 --> 06:09.670
HMM?

06:09.670 --> 06:10.838
- HUH.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.239
I ACTUALLY
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.877
- YOU WILL NEVER
PLAY THIS RECORD.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.747
NOW GET OUT OF MY STUDIO!

06:19.747 --> 06:23.651
[screaming]

06:25.453 --> 06:27.821
WELL, THEY WON'T
TRY THAT AGAIN.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.502
- BEST BOYFRIEND EVER.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.870
I GOT THE BIRTHDAY LUNCH...

06:42.870 --> 06:44.705
- OOH.
- THE BALLOONS.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.073
- HEY.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.975
- NOW ALL I NEED IS JO'S
GIFT-WRAPPED GOLD NECKLACE,

06:47.975 --> 06:50.077
COURTESY OF SUPER FRIEND.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.712
- MM-HMM.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.514
- SO WHERE IS IT?

06:53.514 --> 06:54.515
- WHERE'S WHAT?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.049
- THE GOLD NECKLACE.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.585
- [laughs]
YEP.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.953
- YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT,
DID YOU?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.154
- NO, NO.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.756
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS.

07:04.792 --> 07:05.959
- CAMILLE
THOUGHT IT WAS FOR HER

07:05.959 --> 07:07.360
BECAUSE IT'S OUR
15-MONTH ANNIVERSARY,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.630
AND I'M YOUR SUPER FRIEND,
AND DON'T HURT ME.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.298
I HAVE POWERS.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.400
- YOU GAVE IT TO CAMILLE?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.334
- YOU DIDN'T SEE HER FACE.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.136
I COULDN'T SAY NO, OKAY?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.971
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
A TERRIBLE BOYFRIEND.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.308
- BUT NOW I'M GONNA BE
A TERRIBLE BOYFRIEND.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.176
I HAVE A SPECIAL LUNCH WITH JO
IN ONE HOUR.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.211
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO GIVE HER?

07:29.182 --> 07:30.183
- NO?

07:30.183 --> 07:31.284
- NO!

07:33.554 --> 07:35.956
- I FIGURE WE CAN PUMP
ABOUT THREE BARRELS A DAY.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.057
AND WITH
THE CURRENT COST OF OIL,

07:37.057 --> 07:39.527
THAT'S $150 APIECE.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.128
- WHICH MEANS
I CAN FINALLY AFFORD

07:41.128 --> 07:42.963
TO BUY A NICE PAIR OF SLACKS.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.898
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO HEAR SOMEBODY SAY,

07:44.898 --> 07:47.835
"HEY, BUDDHA BOB,
NICE PAIR OF SLACKS."

07:48.869 --> 07:50.771
- IT'S GOOD TO HAVE GOALS.

07:50.771 --> 07:54.274
- UM, WHAT'S
KATIEBOB OIL COMPANY?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.009
- NOT AN OIL COMPANY.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.883
- YOU ARE CLEARLY PUMPING OIL
ON PALMWOODS PROPERTY,

08:02.883 --> 08:05.553
WHICH GIVES ME THE POWER
TO SHUT YOU DOWN

08:05.553 --> 08:07.888
UNLESS YOU CUT ME IN.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.224
- I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S NOT OIL.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.126
- I'M HERE TO PICK UP
A BARREL OF OIL

08:13.126 --> 08:15.563
FROM KATIEBOB OIL COMPANY.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.831
- YEAH, IT'S OIL.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.437
- NICE BEING IN BUSINESS
WITH YOU, LITTLE LADY.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.573
[horse whinnies]

08:25.573 --> 08:27.140
- DON'T CALL ME THAT.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.244
- * ELEVATE A LITTLE HIGHER

08:31.244 --> 08:34.347
* GONNA GET ME SOME SNACKS
FROM THE PANTRY *

08:34.347 --> 08:36.049
* DO-DO, DO, DO

08:44.858 --> 08:46.994
- OKAY, WE NEED
TO WORK ON OUR CARTWHEELS.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.361
- YEP.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.599
BUT FIRST, WE MUST GET THAT
FRAMED BEAUTY TO THE CRIB,

08:51.599 --> 08:56.336
SMASH IT, AND THEN
LISTEN TO BTR IN PURE GOLD.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.905
- GOLD.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.907
- OH!

08:59.907 --> 09:02.242
- BAD DOG ALERT!
BAD DOG ALERT

09:02.242 --> 09:03.977
- WHAT?

09:03.977 --> 09:08.616
- AH!
- RUN!

09:08.616 --> 09:10.618
- I TOLD YOU
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE IT ALONE.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.319
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE IT ALONE?

09:12.319 --> 09:15.222
- MANY, MANY TIMES.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.457
- OUR GOLDEN VOICES
MUST BE HEARD.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.030
- THIS DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ANYTHING.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.733
BUT NOW THAT YOU CLEARLY
CANNOT BE TRUSTED,

09:25.733 --> 09:27.635
I'M GONNA HANG THIS
IN MY OFFICE

09:27.635 --> 09:31.805
SO THAT WAY, I CAN KEEP
MY EYES ON IT AT ALL TIMES.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.544
- DON'T YOU GUYS EVER GET TIRED
OF SCHEMES AND HIJINKS?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.546
- SOMETIMES.
- BUT NOT TODAY.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.815
WHOO!
- WHOO-HA-HOO!

09:41.815 --> 09:42.783
OH!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.754

09:46.754 --> 09:48.756
THAT'S RESERVED CABANA
FOR A SPECIAL LUNCH

09:48.756 --> 09:50.658
IN ONE HOUR
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.661
NOW SEE THAT?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.028
THAT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND

09:55.028 --> 09:57.364
WEARING MY GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY
PRESENT AROUND HER NECK.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.666
- I DON'T LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.601
- SO USE YOUR SUPER POWERS,
TELL HER YOU MESSED UP,

10:01.601 --> 10:03.003
AND GET THAT GOLD NECKLACE BACK.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.237
- [sighs]

10:04.237 --> 10:05.639
THE SUPER FRIEND
IS ON THE CASE.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.810
[clears throat]

10:09.810 --> 10:13.513

I NEED THE NECKLACE.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.348
- I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.751
CAMILLE WILL BE CRUSHED
AND HATE ME.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.485
TECHNICALLY,
I DID PAY FOR HALF OF IT.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.057
OKAY, WHAT I MEAN IS,
I NEED A SUPER FRIEND.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.325
OKAY?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.994
HELP ME, SUPER FRIEND.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.462

11:02.462 --> 11:03.731
I'LL BE A SUPER FRIEND.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.501
- OKAY,

11:08.501 --> 11:09.937
- WE JUST NEED TO GET CAMILLE

11:09.937 --> 11:12.639
TO GIVE US THE NECKLACE BACK
FOR ONE DAY.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.274
THEN, WHEN WE GET PAID TOMORROW,

11:14.274 --> 11:15.743
WE'LL GO BUY
ANOTHER GOLD NECKLACE

11:15.743 --> 11:18.311
SO BOTH OF OUR GIRLFRIENDS
WILL BE HAPPY.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.448
- GENIUS.
HOW?

11:21.448 --> 11:22.850

THE NECKLACE ENGRAVED

11:24.117 --> 11:26.053
AND YOU'LL HAVE IT
BACK TO HER BY TOMORROW.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.855
BUT REALLY,
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO ME

11:27.855 --> 11:30.157
SO I CAN GIVE IT TO JO

11:49.309 --> 11:51.578
YOU GUYS
ARE GOLD-OBSESSED.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.315
IF ANYTHING, IT'S AN OLD RECORD
THEY REUSE AND SPRAY PAINT.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.153
- THEN I GUESS
YOU WOULDN'T MIND JOINING US

12:00.153 --> 12:01.789
IN OUR GOLD RECORD TEST.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.224
- IF IT WILL GET YOU
OUT OF THE STUDIO,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.793
WHAT'S THE TEST?

12:05.793 --> 12:08.461
- IF ONE OF THOSE GOLD RECORDS
PLAYS THE SONG ON ITS PLAQUE,

12:08.461 --> 12:11.664
WE KNOW OUR GOLD RECORD
WILL PLAY OUR SONG.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.133
- IN GOLD.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.634

TO HEAR THAT RECORD.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.359
- OH.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.062
- SO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
THE NECKLACE BACK?

12:42.062 --> 12:44.865
- BUT JUST TO MAKE IT BETTER
BY GETTING IT ENGRAVED.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.868
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.238
I LOVE IT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.705
- NO, YOU DON'T...

- THERE HE IS.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.401

14:28.401 --> 14:30.737
- I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED
A COMPANY CAR,

14:30.737 --> 14:34.441
PAID FOR WITH
MY COMPANY EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.209
- WE DON'T HAVE
AN EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.145
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OIL
WE'D HAVE TO PUMP A DAY

14:38.145 --> 14:39.646

AND LET'S NOT BLOW A GOOD THING
BY GETTING GREEDY.

14:58.298 --> 15:02.202
GREED IS WHAT
MADE THIS COUNTRY GREEDY.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.438
