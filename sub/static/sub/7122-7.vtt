Yeah, man.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.048
- What?
- Nice.

00:56.050 --> 00:57.783
Hey, princess Bubblegum.

00:57.785 --> 00:59.852
Hey, everybody.

00:59.854 --> 01:02.890
Finn's here! Yay!

01:10.368 --> 01:16.608
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:16.610 --> 01:19.979
Man, dancing is rough.

01:19.981 --> 01:22.982
Yeah. I'm having
some sweat issues

01:22.984 --> 01:24.751
here. I'll go get
us some snack-ity

01:24.753 --> 01:32.753
- juice.
- Hey, man. I'm Jake.

01:34.164 --> 01:38.235
I'm Jake. Hmm.

01:38.237 --> 01:40.838
Check it out, Jake. I
got us some peanuts...

01:40.840 --> 01:44.976
And punch!

01:50.719 --> 01:56.959
Pbht! Choking!

01:56.961 --> 02:01.464
Don't give up on me, man.

02:01.466 --> 02:03.567
Hyah!

02:08.709 --> 02:11.644
Yay!

02:11.646 --> 02:15.416
- Whoa, Finn. Nice book!
- Yeah. It's pretty cool.

02:15.418 --> 02:18.286
It's the enchiridion...
the hero's handbook.

02:18.288 --> 02:21.056
Hey, guy.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.159
Are you all right?

02:23.161 --> 02:25.395
He's all good.

02:25.397 --> 02:28.031
Everybody get back
to your dancing.

02:34.474 --> 02:37.277
Uh, Finn? I think that
bear is following

02:37.279 --> 02:38.812
- us home.
- Whoa.

02:38.814 --> 02:40.881
I think you're right.

02:40.883 --> 02:45.520
Hey, bear. You gonna
come hang out with us?

02:45.522 --> 02:50.126
What do you say, bear?

02:51.931 --> 02:53.997
- Awesome.
- I don't know, Finn.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.367
- This guy seems kind of weird.
- Yeah.

02:56.369 --> 02:58.137
He's totally weird.

02:58.139 --> 03:04.444
Hmm.

03:04.446 --> 03:07.882
Jake. Hey, Jake. Jake?

03:07.884 --> 03:09.718
- What?
- Come here.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.154
- You got to check this out.
- Yeah, okay.

03:12.156 --> 03:14.891
Check this out, man. This
bear is tops blooby!

03:14.893 --> 03:17.661
Watch this.

03:17.663 --> 03:18.863
Ah... Ah...

03:18.865 --> 03:20.599
Choo! Choo!

03:20.601 --> 03:22.501
You got to try this, Jake.

03:22.503 --> 03:28.275
He does everything I do.

03:30.546 --> 03:33.348
Oh, stop.

03:33.350 --> 03:36.152
Come on, Jake. Try it.
It's awesome!

03:36.154 --> 03:39.256
Um, yeah, okay.

03:39.258 --> 03:42.160
Sweepy, sweepy, sweepy!

03:42.162 --> 03:44.762
Sweep, sweep, sweep! Sweeping.

03:48.302 --> 03:51.037
He's got me down pat.
Sweeping's weak.

03:51.039 --> 03:54.742
Mm. Sweeping weak.

03:54.744 --> 03:57.312
Whoa! This guy's all right.

03:57.314 --> 04:00.783
This guy just busted
me in my chops, Finn.

04:00.785 --> 04:02.919
Hey, come on. He's just a bear.

04:02.921 --> 04:07.158
- He don't know nothing.
- Mm. Yeah, I guess.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.494
Well, anyway, it's
getting pretty late.

04:09.496 --> 04:13.032
Probably time for everyone to go
back home to their own houses.

04:13.034 --> 04:15.502
Yeah, I guess
you're right, Jake.

04:15.504 --> 04:18.206
It is pretty late. He
should probably stay here

04:18.208 --> 04:22.277
tonight. You can sleep
in the bathtub.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.279
- Brathtrub.

04:24.281 --> 04:26.316
- Sleep in.
- "Brathtrub!"

04:26.318 --> 04:28.651
This guy's tops blooby.

04:34.494 --> 04:39.933
- Finn?

04:55.354 --> 04:58.991
What?

04:58.993 --> 05:05.031
Hey, princess Bubblegum.
Hey, everybody.

05:05.033 --> 05:11.773
What? Hey. Hey,
princess Bubblegum.

05:11.775 --> 05:19.416
Hey, everybody. What? Hey.

05:19.418 --> 05:21.019
Aah! What are you doing?

05:21.021 --> 05:23.354
Shh. Come with me. You
got to see something.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.392
This bear's wiggy, Finn. He's
wearing your clothes and

05:26.394 --> 05:29.529
- dancing around all crazy.
- That sounds rad, man.

05:29.531 --> 05:31.933
What?! No. Just...

05:34.805 --> 05:38.107
- Aw, man!

05:38.109 --> 05:40.677
Oh, you got to believe me, Finn.

05:40.679 --> 05:43.080
I swear. He was, like,
all wigged out.

05:43.082 --> 05:45.884
He was dancing.

05:45.886 --> 05:48.253
- I do believe you.
- Oh.

05:48.255 --> 05:50.656
It's just, you know, who cares?

05:50.658 --> 05:53.427
Dancing, wearing clothes...
he ain't hurting nobody.

05:53.429 --> 05:56.731
He's just doing it up, you know?
He's just cool, and he likes my

05:56.733 --> 05:58.399
style. That ain't a crime.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.769
No. I guess not.

06:00.771 --> 06:03.339
Okay, great. I'm
going back to bed.

06:03.341 --> 06:05.809
- You coming, smart guy?
- Yeah, okay.

06:24.668 --> 06:28.437
Ahh! Ahh!

06:28.439 --> 06:30.707
<i>You're not even a little
weirded out by this?</i>

06:30.709 --> 06:32.744
No, man. He's just
doing his instincts.

06:32.746 --> 06:34.245
He's just doing his instincts.

06:34.247 --> 06:36.482
He's like a parrot or
chameleon or something.

06:36.484 --> 06:38.417
Like a parrot or
chameleon or something.

06:38.419 --> 06:39.986
He's funny. He's funny.

06:39.988 --> 06:44.258
Anyway, I got to go pick
up beemo from soccer.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.994
I'll be back soon. And remember...
don't eat my

06:46.996 --> 06:50.499
special Finn cakes. Finn only.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.869
Yeah, I get it. You don't
need to tell me that

06:52.871 --> 07:00.871
every time you make Finn cakes.
Bah!

07:02.950 --> 07:08.555
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

07:08.557 --> 07:12.493
Why, you little...
Trying to set me up, eh?

07:12.495 --> 07:17.067
You think you're so smart,
but this time, I'm ready.

07:25.179 --> 07:29.682
Oh, my glob! What?! Jake!
You ate all my Finn cakes.

07:29.684 --> 07:32.186
- What the stink?!
- Uh, nope.

07:32.188 --> 07:34.456
The bear did it, and
I've got proof.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.624
- I taped the whole thing!
- The bear ate all my

07:36.626 --> 07:39.228
cakes, and you just sat there
and watched him do it?!

07:39.230 --> 07:42.966
- What's wrong with you!?
- Uh, what? No, man.

07:42.968 --> 07:45.770
He was trying to frame me, Finn!
He's trying to steal your

07:45.772 --> 07:48.473
identity! Why can't
you grok that!?

07:48.475 --> 07:50.409
He's a bear, Jake.

07:50.411 --> 07:52.579
He's a wild animal. He
doesn't know things.

07:52.581 --> 07:55.982
- He just does stuff. He's cool.
- Oh, fine.

07:55.984 --> 07:59.753
Well, that's just great. Then you and m.C.
Cool friend

07:59.755 --> 08:03.391
can go stink it up together at
your stupid, cool Finn party all

08:03.393 --> 08:05.862
by yourselves, 'cause
I'm not going!

08:05.864 --> 08:08.398
Wait... what? What party?

08:08.400 --> 08:12.170
What? Your party, man. Tonight?
In the woods?

08:15.208 --> 08:17.176
But I didn't make this flyer.

08:17.178 --> 08:18.945
Huh? Well, who did, then?

08:18.947 --> 08:25.052
The bear.

08:25.054 --> 08:26.054
I knew it.

08:26.956 --> 08:30.460
See, dude?

08:30.462 --> 08:33.964
He's not just jacking your
style, he's jacking your whole

08:33.966 --> 08:36.467
you! Jacking yo' you up.

08:36.470 --> 08:40.339
- What the what?
- He got in close and

08:40.341 --> 08:43.009
used you. Now he's
feeding nuts to your

08:43.010 --> 08:45.345
ex-girlfriend. - Sure, I'll have

08:45.347 --> 08:49.317
- another nut.
- She's not my... we

08:49.319 --> 08:53.822
- never went steady.
- Bleh.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.126
He's trying to replace

08:56.128 --> 08:59.764
you, and he's already got
everyone convinced he's you!

08:59.766 --> 09:04.036
He didn't really like you.
He used you.

09:08.509 --> 09:12.981
Troops brooby! Troops brooby!
Troops...

09:12.983 --> 09:14.249
Ow!

09:14.251 --> 09:16.652
Not cool, man.

09:16.654 --> 09:20.257
You're not me. You're
just a bear acting like

09:20.259 --> 09:27.600
me.

09:27.602 --> 09:30.169
It's okay, everyone.
The imposter is gone.

09:30.171 --> 09:33.106
Finn, nobody really
thought the bear was you.

09:33.108 --> 09:35.376
- Wait. What?
- We just thought it

09:35.378 --> 09:38.814
was one of your
jokey-joke jokes.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.658
- Hey! Hey, bear!
- Wait up, guy.

09:47.660 --> 09:50.962
Hey, I... I didn't mean

09:50.964 --> 09:53.466
to make you feel so
bad about yourself.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.169
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Me, too.

09:56.171 --> 09:59.673
But you're a super-rad bear,
so why not just be you?

09:59.675 --> 10:06.582
- I want be hero like you!
- Aww.

10:06.584 --> 10:10.487
I guess he's got a heart
of gold after all.

10:10.489 --> 10:13.557
Hold on, bear. I got
something for you.

10:13.559 --> 10:16.395
It's the enchiridion...
the hero's handbook.

10:16.397 --> 10:21.034
Everything you need to know
about being a hero is in this

10:21.036 --> 10:24.705
book. Take it and learn.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.676
Finn, are you nuts? We
can't give that book away.

10:27.678 --> 10:29.845
- It's, like, crazy important.
- Whatever, man.

10:29.847 --> 10:32.181
We never use it except for,
like, sitting on it when the

10:32.183 --> 10:36.721
grass is wet and stuff. Drink
your fill of knowledge.

10:36.723 --> 10:41.727
Someday, you'll be a great hero.
Thank you, Finn.

10:41.729 --> 10:44.264
Thank you.

11:03.656 --> 11:08.995
Ooooh! Did you bring the book?

11:08.997 --> 11:13.101
Yes. One step closer.
