WEBVTT

00:01.801 --> 00:02.973
Morning.
Hey.

00:03.036 --> 00:05.516
Hey, can you approve this new
design for the campaign poster?

00:05.572 --> 00:08.348
Oh, Ann, you beautiful,
rule-breaking moth.

00:08.408 --> 00:11.218
You know we can't talk
about my campaign in here.

00:11.277 --> 00:14.019
Seriously? It's a
yes or no question.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.822
When you're
running for office,

00:15.882 --> 00:17.327
there are,
like, a million rules

00:17.450 --> 00:18.929
of what you
can and cannot do.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.020
Yes.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.087
And because I work
for the government,

00:21.154 --> 00:23.100
I am not allowed to do
anything campaign-related

00:23.156 --> 00:24.430
inside a
government building.

00:24.991 --> 00:26.664
Boss, I need your
Herbie Hancock on this.

00:26.726 --> 00:28.034
Outside.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.766
It's kind of a pain in the ass.
But it's great exercise.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.503
But it's a
pain in the ass.

00:33.566 --> 00:34.704
So, Perd Hapley
wants to do Thursday now.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.769
Fine.

00:35.835 --> 00:36.973
Did you finish
the maintenance report?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.516
I did not finish it,
but I will finish it.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.278
So, wait. What was your question again?
The slogan?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.341
Okay. Can I just
come out there

00:41.408 --> 00:42.443
so we can talk
about everything?

00:42.509 --> 00:44.955
No. April, I need to keep
my work separate. Okay?

00:45.011 --> 00:47.218
Just think of it
like a fun game.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.588
Parks is inside,
campaign is outside.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.492
Parks is inside.
Campaign is outside.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.859
You know what would
make it more fun?

00:52.919 --> 00:54.193
What?
Oh, my God. This.

00:57.123 --> 00:58.158
April!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.812 --> 01:20.223
It's time, Leslie.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.783
You have to take a leave of
absence from the department.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.453
Ron, that is ridiculous.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.621
We've talked about this.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.822
No, you've talked about it.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.729
And I've ignored it
because it is ridiculous.

01:28.955 --> 01:31.765
Need I remind you that even
if I win the election,

01:31.825 --> 01:33.668
I can still work at
the Parks Department.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.171
City Council is
a part-time job.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.606
But campaigning
is a full-time job.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.167
Right now, you're working
50 hours a week here

01:40.233 --> 01:42.270
and 50 hours
a week on the campaign.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.643
Well, I have
time to spare.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.343
I'm also volunteering at
Wheels for Meals on Wheels.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.347
We repair vans
for Meals on Wheels.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.849
You're a month
behind on everything.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.824
You forgot to file the Weekly
Parks Maintenance Report.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.758
You do it every week,
and you forgot.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.557
Things are falling
through the cracks.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.791
I'm pretty sure you've worn that
sweater four days in a row.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.425
Or I own four identical
versions of the same sweater.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.299
No, you don't.
There's an old lollipop

02:05.425 --> 02:07.336
that's been stuck to
the back since Tuesday.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.436
That's the style now, Ron.
It's called lollipoping.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.101
All the kids
are doing it.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.079
Leslie, you need to
take a sabbatical.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.209
Okay. You know what, Ron?
I accept your apology,

02:20.273 --> 02:21.946
I will not take a
sabbatical, as we agreed,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.782
and we will never
discuss this again.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.115
Sorry, Ann. You can't
open this gift.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.058
It's for the most
beautiful girl in Pawnee.

02:30.917 --> 02:34.364
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
Wait. That's you.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.259
Wow.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.462
Yeah. And look,
I got one, too.

02:41.628 --> 02:42.834
Matching his and hers.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.844
So, I'm Tommy's Girl and you're just Tom?
Why not Ann's man?

02:47.433 --> 02:49.344
Nobody owns me, cupcake.
Not even you.

02:49.402 --> 02:53.373
You can either burn these hats in a
fire, or you can use a blowtorch.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.816
How about this option?

02:55.275 --> 02:57.255
We put the hats on...
Don't say it.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.846
And we take
everything else off.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.986
These Kangol hats
are exactly

03:04.050 --> 03:06.621
like the one Samuel L. Jackson
wore to the Latin GRAMMYs.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.687
How could she not
like them?

03:07.754 --> 03:08.755
I don't know.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.700
It's like, somehow, everything
I do with her is wrong.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.999
Dude, seriously,
leave me out of this.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.937
I kind of set up
Tom and Ann.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.373
And now, they won't stop
asking me for advice.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.342
Which is a really
bad move on their part.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.279
Because I really don't care
what happens to them.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.014
Or anyone.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.284
Champion. Hey, bud.
I missed you.

03:31.344 --> 03:32.880
Thank you so much.
I hope he wasn't a handful.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.392
Not in the slightest.
As the Germans would say...

03:38.284 --> 03:39.456
He is a wonder dog.

03:39.519 --> 03:40.520
Oh.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.260
The dog training course I took was
conducted entirely in German.

03:43.323 --> 03:46.861
And so, now, I'm fluent in German.
Words relating to dogs.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.735
April and Andy
went away for the night,

03:48.861 --> 03:50.670
and I looked
after Champion here.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.870
He's a mutt.
Half amazing, half terrific.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.748
Ich bin ein three-legged dog.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.245
Well, I took him to PetSmart.
I got him various toys,

04:01.307 --> 04:02.980
got him shots,
got him groomed,

04:03.109 --> 04:04.782
and gave him
plenty of exercise.

04:04.844 --> 04:05.879
He's healthier
than ever.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.891
Wait, did his leg
grow back?

04:07.947 --> 04:10.188
No. No,
that's okay.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.752
Andy, if I may...
Yes.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.355
Dogs tend to take on the
personalities of their owners.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.731
So, if you were to sit on your
couch all day, watching cartoons

04:17.790 --> 04:18.928
and eating
nothing but Cheetos,

04:19.058 --> 04:20.230
that's what he
would want to do, too.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.331
Who wouldn't? That sounds
like an amazing day. Right?

04:23.396 --> 04:25.205
Okay. Well, thanks.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.770
Bye, Champion.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.375
Morning, Leslie.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.679
Jerry. Take that shirt off.
You look ridiculous.

04:32.739 --> 04:36.687
Gayle gave me this shirt
yesterday as a birthday present.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.623
Oh, my God. Jerry. I can't
believe I forgot your birthday.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.991
Leslie, it is okay. I mean, let's face it.
It's a tough one to remember.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.656
My birthday
is February 29th.

04:46.719 --> 04:49.893
So, I only get one real birthday,
you know, once every four years.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.401
But it's great,
because my wife, Gayle,

04:51.524 --> 04:52.969
makes such a big
deal out of it.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.734
We go and we split a huge piece
of cotton candy cheesecake

04:55.795 --> 04:57.570
from Cakey J's
Cheesecake Facility.

04:57.630 --> 05:02.010
And then, well, we hold hands for
awhile, we listen to some Anita Baker,

05:02.535 --> 05:06.244
she meets up with some
friends, and I turn in early.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.547
This is unacceptable.
Birthdays are important.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.019
I'm so sorry
we forgot yours.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.716
I guess it just
slipped through the cracks.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.050
Yes, I guess it did.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.560
Anyway. happy
birthday to Jerry.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.827
You are a kind
and wonderful soul.

05:19.886 --> 05:20.887
Thank you.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.695
Also, I need you to do some fecal
contamination testing at the reservoir.

05:23.756 --> 05:24.826
Now?
Yes.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.097
Go get a kit
from Maintenance,

05:26.159 --> 05:27.763
and I need you to check
the water for bird dung.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.999
Okay. Can I at
least grab the gloves?

05:29.062 --> 05:31.338
Jerry, what are you doing standing here?
Our water has poop in it.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.637
Oh, my God.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.272
Now, Jerry is
turning 64 this year.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.337
He's only 64?

05:37.437 --> 05:39.417
Sixty-four
divided by four is...

05:39.472 --> 05:40.473
- Sixty-four.
- Sixteen.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.646
So, we're going to throw him
a Sweet 16 surprise party.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.348
It's going to be
very special.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.015
The usual?
Cake and pop?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.821
No, April,
the unusual.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.083
Fish and pop.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.719
No.
Cake and fish?

05:51.784 --> 05:55.755
No. No fish. Jerry only gets a
real birthday every four years.

05:55.822 --> 05:59.634
And four years from now, who knows,
he might be retired or dead.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.172
Let's start a pool. Who wants retired?
Who wants dead?

06:02.228 --> 06:03.263
Dead.
No.

06:03.329 --> 06:04.808
I got one dead.
No.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.006
Do you need
to take that?

06:07.100 --> 06:10.206
No. The campaign can wait. Because
this is official Parks business.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.612
Donna, can we use
your lake house?

06:12.672 --> 06:13.844
How did you
know about that?

06:13.906 --> 06:17.547
My family has a lake house up in the
foothills, but we keep it quiet.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.248
We're not big
on hospitality.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.849
The Meagles
are a cold people.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.258
Can we use
your house?

06:25.118 --> 06:28.588
I suppose.
Bring your own towels.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.531
Wow, Donna.
This place is beautiful.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.368
Yes, it is,
and it will stay that way.

06:35.428 --> 06:38.671
These are the house rules.
No dirty shoes in the house.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.472
Upstairs is
Meagle space only.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.446
And if you listen closely... That
is the bubbling of the hot tub.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.677
You do not have
access to it.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.846
If you follow these rules,
we won't have a problem.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.014
Oh, my God.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.614
Is that Ginuwine?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.082
Uh-huh.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.993
Why do you have Ginuwine's
Platinum Record on your wall?

06:59.552 --> 07:03.056
Why do you have a photo of you
with Ginuwine at some place?

07:03.122 --> 07:06.763
Oh, have I never talked about this before?
Ginuwine is my cousin.

07:07.627 --> 07:08.935
Ginuwine?

07:08.995 --> 07:12.101
The Ginuwine
is your cousin?

07:12.165 --> 07:13.610
How do I not know this?

07:13.866 --> 07:15.140
Who's Ginuwine?

07:17.136 --> 07:18.171
Ginuwine?

07:20.773 --> 07:25.017
Ginuwine is Ginuwine.
He's Ginuwine.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.079
Saying his name over and over
again is not going to help me.

07:27.146 --> 07:30.184
He's an R&B singer?
Pony? Differences?

07:31.217 --> 07:33.163
Do you really not know
who Ginuwine is?

07:33.219 --> 07:34.926
I know that he's
Donna's cousin.

07:35.321 --> 07:39.098
When I'm dating someone, I have
a list called my "Oh-no-no's."

07:39.158 --> 07:42.105
lf a woman commits an Oh-no-no,
it can end the relationship.

07:42.161 --> 07:48.203
Not loving '90s R&B music is number
three on the Oh-no-no's list.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.111
Girl don't even know
who Ginuwine is.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.214
Hey, boy.
How was the ride?

07:54.273 --> 07:55.411
Hey, you want me to
show you something?

07:55.541 --> 07:56.679
Okay.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.422
See? It's pretty cool, huh?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.429
Would you like me
to teach you?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.396
Whatever. I mean,
anybody can do that.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.662
Champion. Taxi. Foxit.

08:11.924 --> 08:15.895
Chech-en-chess.
Ka-te-day. Toxic. Merkel.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.300
Merkel.
What is "Merkel"?

08:17.530 --> 08:19.635
She's the
Chancellor of Germany.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.947
Not only more jobs,
but better jobs.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.449
I just did a phone interview
while simultaneously decorating

08:26.506 --> 08:28.110
this house for
Jerry's surprise party.

08:28.541 --> 08:32.318
Totally multi-tasking.
Totally on top of all of it.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.188
Crow for dinner tonight
Mr. Swanson?

08:35.248 --> 08:37.193
Okay. We are locked and loaded.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.296
Music is ready.
Slide show is prepped.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.592
April, when does
Jerry arrive?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.392
How would I know?

08:42.488 --> 08:43.990
Who was supposed
to invite Jerry?

08:44.490 --> 08:48.028
Guys, someone was supposed
to invite Jerry. It's his...

08:49.161 --> 08:51.038
Crap. It was me.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.299
I forgot to invite Jerry.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.215
You need to
take a sabbatical.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.839
I'm not taking
a sabbatical.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.249
Is this because I
forgot to invite

09:01.374 --> 09:02.751
Jerry to his
own birthday party?

09:02.808 --> 09:04.014
It did seem
like an oversight.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.383
I have a prediction, Ron.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.787
By the end of the night,
you are going

09:06.913 --> 09:08.256
to take a bite
of Jerry's cake.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.352
Which, incidentally, we need
to pick up on the way home.

09:11.417 --> 09:14.887
And you are going to say,
"Sabbatical shmabbatical.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.594
"Leslie can do it all. She's
the best, and I'm stupid."

09:18.758 --> 09:20.704
That does sound like me.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.097
Hey. Here's a fun game.

09:24.163 --> 09:27.474
Let's talk minimum acceptable
thread count for sheets.

09:27.934 --> 09:28.935
That does sound fun.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.412
Stop me when I hit it.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.675
1,000.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.176
800.

09:35.675 --> 09:36.745
700.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.014
600?

09:40.079 --> 09:42.081
Ann, I'm at 600. Are you
really not stopping me?

09:42.148 --> 09:43.957
I have those
cotton t-shirt sheets.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.017
Huh?

09:45.918 --> 09:49.764
It's always the most beautiful
ladies who hurt you the worst.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.002
She's never seen a single
Paul Walker movie.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.231
That's a huge
Oh-no-no.

09:54.293 --> 09:57.570
She also "doesn't care"
about Blu-ray.

09:57.697 --> 09:58.732
She's a monster.

09:58.864 --> 09:59.899
April, this is serious.

10:00.232 --> 10:01.506
I might have to
break up with Ann.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.569
Yeah. Well,
then, break up with her.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.114
But she's
my dream girl.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.445
Then, don't break up
with her.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.880
Except she hates
everything I like.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.420
I own more pairs of
UGGs than she does.

10:10.643 --> 10:13.522
I was getting kind of sick
of listening to Tom and Ann

10:13.579 --> 10:15.889
talk about
their relationship.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.622
But then I remembered
that alcohol existed.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.665
Thank you, alcohol.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.501
Jerry? Jerry?

10:27.827 --> 10:29.170
Where the hell
can he be?

10:29.228 --> 10:31.504
Maybe someone else
had a surprise party

10:31.597 --> 10:33.941
and actually remembered
to invite him.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.505
Jerry? Jerry?

10:39.038 --> 10:41.018
- Jerry? Jerry?
- Come on in!

10:42.708 --> 10:44.813
Oh, God.
Leslie.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.356
Hello, Jerry.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.619
Jerry. Why did you
call us in here?

10:48.781 --> 10:50.192
Well, because
I thought you were Gayle.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.727
What are you
doing in my bathroom?

10:51.784 --> 10:54.958
Yes, Leslie. What are we
doing in Jerry's bathroom?

10:55.454 --> 10:59.834
There is a Parks emergency that
only you can help us solve.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.838
So, we need you to get out of the tub.
Let's get going.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.465
Oh, God. Okay, jeez.
I've got to get dressed.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.873
No. There's no time.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.341
There's time, Jerry.
Get dressed.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.341
Okay. Well,
what is the big emergency?

11:10.469 --> 11:12.745
Did we lose more
seniors in the woods?

11:12.805 --> 11:14.079
No. It's a sinkhole, right?

11:14.140 --> 11:18.088
Crap on a catapult. They
screwed up my campaign signs.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.418
Now, I've got to deal with this.

11:19.545 --> 11:20.819
Okay. But what about
the sinkhole?

11:20.880 --> 11:24.259
Don't worry. Leslie will deal
with this and the sinkhole.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.852
Right, Leslie?

11:26.519 --> 11:30.524
Yes, Ron. I will, Ron.
And I shall do it with aplomb.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.504
What the hell is wrong with Tom?
Don't know.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.166
It's like I'm dating some
idiotic game show host.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.438
He is driving me crazy
with these stupid questions.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.807
Well, soon,
it won't matter.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.806
Why? What did
he tell you?

11:43.936 --> 11:45.040
Nothing.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.984
Wait. Is he going to
break up with me?

11:48.407 --> 11:49.784
I don't know. I'm...

11:49.842 --> 11:53.984
No,no,no. No. That's not
how this ends. Okay?

11:54.046 --> 11:55.821
I break up with him.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.221
I think I will celebrate
with a drink.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.561
Quit pulling. Fine,
I'll let you off the leash.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.161
- Andy.
- What the , dude?

12:07.226 --> 12:08.637
Where did you come from?
I think that Champion

12:08.694 --> 12:12.437
should stay on his leash. There's
unfamiliar terrain and strange smells.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.637
No. Leashes are just for dogs
that bite people.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.940
That's not true.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.572
Chris, Champion is my dog.
Okay?

12:18.938 --> 12:20.144
He's not
going anywhere.

12:20.206 --> 12:23.016
Sometimes, you just have to
let a dog be a dog.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.611
He'll be all right.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.248
Champion!

12:30.182 --> 12:31.422
He'll come back.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.090
So, as you can imagine,
we would never have

12:34.153 --> 12:36.292
ordered a sign with all this
complicated nonsense.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.528
Because, you know,
we're not insane.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.593
You see right here
on the order form?

12:40.659 --> 12:42.570
It says,
"H-T-T-P-colon...

12:42.628 --> 12:44.574
"...slash-slash-W-W-W-dot..."
I realize that.

12:44.630 --> 12:45.973
"...knope-201 
It does.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.477
"...dot-com-slash-images,
C-M-Y..." Well...

12:48.734 --> 12:50.372
But this isn't the...
"...K-slash-campaign..."

12:50.436 --> 12:51.471
This isn't what...

12:51.604 --> 12:52.674
"...slash-Q-T-Y-
1-0-0-1-2-3..."

12:52.738 --> 12:54.581
You don't need to
read the whole thing.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.550
"...slash-0-9-2-
3-0-0-2-3-0-9...

12:56.609 --> 12:57.815
"...T-W-poster..."
It does say that.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.016
"...dot-J-P-E-G."

13:00.312 --> 13:03.020
J-PEG. Yes, Walter, it does say that.
You're right.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.858
But using basic logic
and human intelligence,

13:05.918 --> 13:09.525
one can surmise that this
is a link to an image.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.159
This isn't what we wanted
printed on the signs.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.135
Whatever's on
the order form, I print.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.899
In this case, it was a long
string of letters and numbers.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.839
Can I just show you something here?
There you go.

13:18.898 --> 13:19.933
This is highly
against protocol.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.137
Well, here. Look.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.078
Now, that's
a good sign.

13:23.669 --> 13:24.909
You should have
used that.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.351
You told April you were
breaking up with me?

13:28.407 --> 13:31.752
Ann, we consistently disagree
on who wore it best.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.848
You still use
an iPad One.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.689
You read books. All the time.
Okay.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.990
How about my
Oh-no-no's for you?

13:39.051 --> 13:40.428
You make me see
terrible movies,

13:40.553 --> 13:41.930
and then you
talk through them.

13:42.021 --> 13:45.093
You put 20-inch rims
on your Volkswagen Golf.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.635
And you insist on being
introduced as the brown Gosling.

13:48.694 --> 13:52.232
Everything you just said
makes me like me more.

13:52.298 --> 13:56.041
I can't take it anymore. Okay? I'm
breaking you up. You guys are done.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.136
Fine.
Fine with me.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.238
Fine.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.044
Oh, April.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.552
I'm drunk. You made me drunk.
You made me drunk.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.380
And you.

14:05.444 --> 14:06.923
No. No.
Give it a rest.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.925
No. I need it.
Okay.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.425
- Fine!
- Let's get you to bed.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.359
You know, why are you guys
even fighting anyway?

14:12.418 --> 14:13.453
It's so stupid.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.590
I hate Ann because
of this stupid reason.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.362
And I hate Tom for this stupid reason.
Who cares?

14:18.791 --> 14:20.668
You want some help?
No, I got it.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.330
Well, we did
everything, Ron.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.101
We got new signs, we put
them in people's yards,

14:24.230 --> 14:25.971
we got Jerry
for the surprise...

14:26.031 --> 14:29.376
The sinkhole emergency,
and we briefly ran out of gas.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.210
And then, we walked to the gas
station and we got more gas.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.681
And now, we're all good.
Yep.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.308
You truly are attempting
to do it all.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.374
Thank you.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.318
We didn't get to the drugstore
for my liver medication.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.480
Well, you should
have thought about that

14:38.544 --> 14:40.080
before we dragged you
out of the bath, Jerry.

14:40.646 --> 14:41.750
Yeah.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.327
Okay, wait a second. This is
clearly not a sinkhole problem.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.522
What's going on?

14:46.585 --> 14:50.192
Jerry, as soon as we open this door,
everything will become clear.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.395
- Surprise! Oh, no.
- What the!

14:58.631 --> 14:59.905
Surprise.

15:02.201 --> 15:03.680
Where the hell
is everybody?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.842
Well, it got so late, we just
weren't sure you were still coming.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.444
Everybody's either in bed
or out looking for Champion.

15:10.509 --> 15:11.920
Oh, yeah.
Champion ran away.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.752
Wake everybody up.
Leslie.

15:13.812 --> 15:14.984
No. I am not going to
let this fall apart.

15:15.047 --> 15:19.018
We are going to throw Jerry an
amazing Sweet 16 surprise party,

15:19.084 --> 15:21.655
no matter how agonizing
it is for all of us.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.861
That's the spirit.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.900
Champion!
Champion!

15:26.959 --> 15:28.029
Champion,
come here, boy!

15:28.093 --> 15:31.404
I have an organic,
gluten free, soy bone for you!

15:31.463 --> 15:32.737
Champion!

15:33.065 --> 15:34.567
Chris, there's something
I have to tell you.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.739
I ate one of your
soy bones.

15:38.804 --> 15:40.545
Really? Yeah. It
was really good.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.483
I was going to
give it to Champion,

15:42.608 --> 15:44.485
but it just,
it looked so yummy.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.548
The point is,
I'm a terrible dog owner.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.586
And I think, if we find
Champion, you should keep him.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.528
Andy, if it wasn't
for you and April,

15:55.587 --> 15:57.225
Champion would still
be back at the pound.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.099
Okay? You gave him a home.
That's amazing.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.399
He's your dog. If you just call out
his name, he will come to you.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.034
What... No, he won't. Because I've
been trying, and it didn't work.

16:08.233 --> 16:11.237
I think he likes your music.
Why don't you sing to him?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.874
Really? I don't have my guitar.
I usually... Come on.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.249
I feel naked
without it. Okay.

16:18.210 --> 16:22.181
Champion,
you're lost

16:23.148 --> 16:25.321
But soon, you'll be found

16:25.384 --> 16:30.595
<i>I rescued you
from the pound</i>

16:30.656 --> 16:33.330
Something,
something, hold me

16:34.026 --> 16:35.596
On the ground

16:36.028 --> 16:38.338
You know, I don't...

16:38.497 --> 16:39.635
Champion!

16:39.698 --> 16:43.475
Champion! Hey!
Oh, buddy, you came back.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.613
You came back.
To my voice.

16:47.806 --> 16:48.876
Dog whistle.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.312
- April, wake up.
- Jerry's here.

16:51.777 --> 16:52.847
April.
April.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.185
Hey.
Hi.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.316
Hi.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.820
Why is your arm around her?
I broke you up.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.887
Well, we got back together again.
Because of what you said.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.490
What do you mean?
I didn't say anything?

17:03.555 --> 17:06.092
Yeah, when we were carrying you
to bed, you correctly pointed out

17:06.157 --> 17:08.968
that we were arguing about
stuff that was stupid.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.531
And so, we talked it out and I
apologized and he apologized.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.133
And now,
everything is great.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.404
Thanks.
No!

17:14.867 --> 17:17.279
I'm drunk.
Don't listen to me. No!

17:17.336 --> 17:19.111
See you out there.
No!

17:19.738 --> 17:22.651
Wow! Thanks, guys. This is really...
This is really great.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.813
Okay. I want everyone
to go around

17:24.943 --> 17:27.082
and tell their
favorite Jerry story.

17:28.847 --> 17:29.951
A positive one.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.191
Who's first?

17:35.721 --> 17:40.898
Jerry, today is your birthday, but
it's about much more than that.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.696
It's also about Ann and
I getting back together

17:43.762 --> 17:45.298
and being the hottest
couple in Pawnee.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.671
I'd also like to announce our
official relationship mash-up name.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.743
It's Tan. To Tan.

17:52.938 --> 17:57.011
I would like to announce that the
name Tan is officially over.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.714
To the end of Tan.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.279
Haverkins it is.

18:00.379 --> 18:01.449
Okay. Donna?

18:01.513 --> 18:03.584
I would like to
address the fact

18:03.715 --> 18:05.820
that rule number
seven says no pets.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.364
And yet, there is a three-legged
animal in my living room.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.763
Okay. Ron?

18:10.222 --> 18:13.795
Jerry's work is
often adequate.

18:19.965 --> 18:20.966
I'll go.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.239
Jerry has a wife

18:23.302 --> 18:27.250
and three beautiful daughters. A full life.
And that's amazing.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.219
April and Andy have Champion,
and that's amazing.

18:30.342 --> 18:33.346
I have a step-brother
who lives in London

18:33.712 --> 18:36.522
and 2.8% body fat.

18:39.318 --> 18:42.492
Guys. Guys.
What do I do?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
I mean, she's asleep.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.294
You probably should just
sit there and not move.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.736
She's really tired
Just a few hours.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.966
A few hours?

18:50.562 --> 18:52.269
Is this all
the eggs we have?

18:53.098 --> 18:55.476
Yes. What are
you making?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.136
Eggs.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.984
Leslie.
Surprise!

19:03.208 --> 19:04.585
Oh, God.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.280
What happened?

19:06.345 --> 19:09.019
Well, you slept with
Jerry last night.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.557
No. I was planning Jerry's
morning surprise party.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.930
Morning surprise parties are always the best.
Let's get going.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.400
I made some coffee.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.025
Let's go for a walk.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.000
I now officially insist
that you take a sabbatical.

19:24.062 --> 19:25.439
No, no.
Let me finish.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.745
I used to work in
a sheet metal factory.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.782
But then, a job came
along at the tannery.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.581
The hours were better,
and I would get paid.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.519
Also, I'd have the chance
to work with leather,

19:38.577 --> 19:41.387
both before and
after it was on the cow,

19:41.446 --> 19:43.016
which had always
been a dream of mine.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.188
I didn't want to give
up my sheet metal job,

19:45.250 --> 19:48.231
so I tried to do both jobs
and finish middle school.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.288
How old were you?

19:49.421 --> 19:50.456
Eleven.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.064
The point is,
I was so tired,

19:54.126 --> 19:56.868
l tried to puncture an
eight gauge aluminum foil

19:56.929 --> 19:58.875
with a leather awl.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.142
Well...
I learned a lesson.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.414
Never half-ass
two things.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.482
Whole-ass one thing.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.847
So, if you want
to win that seat...

20:08.974 --> 20:10.317
Which I do.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.289
Then, commit yourself 100%.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.620
Take a sabbatical.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.518
I will cut back
to 10 hours a week.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.255
Deal.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.121
Fifteen.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.526
Ten.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.225
Deal.

20:29.194 --> 20:31.231
I can't believe I got
them back together.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.367
Now, they're always going to want
to come talk to me about stuff.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.502
No, it's a
good thing, babe.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.206
They want to talk to you because
you're important to them.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.040
Yes. But I hate them.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.412
I know you do, sweetheart.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.078
Oh, hey, by the way,
I think that Chris is lonely.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.087
So, I told him he can
borrow Champion whenever.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.183
Andy! He's kissing me!

20:52.618 --> 20:55.622
Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that
I screwed up your birthday party.

20:55.721 --> 20:56.722
Oh, that's okay.

20:56.822 --> 20:57.823
But we all pitched in,

20:57.889 --> 21:00.028
and we are sending
you and Gayle to a

21:00.158 --> 21:02.297
B&B in your favorite
place in the world.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.034
Muncie?

21:04.296 --> 21:07.641
Amazingly, yes.
Muncie, Indiana.

21:07.699 --> 21:08.871
Thank you, guys-

21:09.001 --> 21:10.173
It was really expensive.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.416
Oh, campaign.
Take it.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.351
Excuse me.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.753
It's a bed and breakfast.
They...

21:20.812 --> 21:22.485
You can sleep there
and you get breakfast, too.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.582
It was
pretty expensive.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.026
This is Leslie.
