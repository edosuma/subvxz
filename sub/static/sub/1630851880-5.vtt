A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.250 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
FIVE MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND SIX MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:23.416 --> 00:27.250
In ancient China, magnolias were used

00:27.333 --> 00:30.208
to represent femininity and gentleness,

00:30.291 --> 00:32.541
because it's a delicate
and beautiful plant.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.250
But mine looks awful.

00:34.916 --> 00:36.750
Let's see. It's because

00:38.083 --> 00:39.333
this goes over here.

00:39.916 --> 00:40.750
Okay?

00:41.666 --> 00:42.875
-Turned around?
-That's it.

00:47.583 --> 00:49.708
Take it easy, hon. No worries.

00:49.791 --> 00:52.000
-Can't you see I'm running?
-I can.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.458
-Hold this.
-Come on, I have an appointment.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.875
-Eat up.
-Are you taking this in?

00:57.458 --> 00:58.541
What else can I do?

00:58.625 --> 01:00.041
-Let's finish it.
-I'll help.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.166
-Okay.
-All right.

01:01.250 --> 01:02.333
-Let me…
-Take a bite.

01:04.458 --> 01:07.583
-Careful, you're going to eat the paper!
-You slob! Hang on.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.833
Good, give it to me.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.458
Eat up.
You're going to get it all over me.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.791
Finish it.

01:16.875 --> 01:18.333
-It's delicious.
-Yeah, it is.

01:21.125 --> 01:25.083
Hi, how are you? Good afternoon.
5:30. You're Lina, right?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.208
How are you? I'm Luis Miguel.
Not the singer. Miguel is my last name.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.291
-And you are…?
-Laura.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.083
Nice to meet you.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.500
So, come on in, please.

01:36.166 --> 01:39.208
This is the apartment.
It's totally refurbished.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.458
Original wood floors, okay?

01:41.541 --> 01:44.916
You probably saw this in the ad,
but it has two rooms, okay?

01:45.666 --> 01:47.791
It would be for the two of you, right?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.000
Yeah. Yes.

01:51.291 --> 01:55.000
This is the second room.
It's slightly smaller than the main room,

01:55.083 --> 01:59.333
but it's perfect for a small office or if…
you're planning to have kids.

02:00.416 --> 02:01.250
Well…

02:02.166 --> 02:03.916
We've thought about it, sure.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.916
Wipe your face.
You've got something there.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.541
-Here?
-No, the other side.

02:08.625 --> 02:09.666
-Look at that.
-Yeah.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.375
-Did I get it?
-Yeah, you did.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.916
This is the kitchen. It's fully equipped,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.250
and, in my opinion, just seeing it
makes you want to cook, right?

02:19.833 --> 02:23.041
Super cute, very practical. Awesome.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.083
Is there an oven?

02:25.291 --> 02:27.458
No, it doesn't have an oven.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.916
But you could have
an electric oven installed

02:30.000 --> 02:31.416
right over there, or…

02:31.500 --> 02:33.875
right there would be a good spot, right?

02:34.750 --> 02:37.625
But, babe,
have you ever even used an oven?

02:38.708 --> 02:41.375
Let me remind you,
I used to bake delicious cakes.

02:41.458 --> 02:44.083
-You loved eating them, remember?
-That's true.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.750
-Let's move on, okay?
-Yes.

02:47.833 --> 02:48.666
Yes.

02:49.916 --> 02:51.458
So, it has gas heating?

02:51.541 --> 02:52.708
Yes, of course.

02:53.291 --> 02:54.916
Awesome. It's perfect.

02:56.791 --> 02:57.875
It is lovely, yes.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.000
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.541
-Because of the oven?
-Yes.

03:05.625 --> 03:06.791
What's up?

03:06.875 --> 03:09.791
We just saw the perfect apartment.
It's amazing.

03:09.875 --> 03:12.125
But it didn't have an oven
so now she's not sure.

03:13.000 --> 03:13.833
Excuse me?

03:15.291 --> 03:18.541
Since when has an oven
been at the center of your life?

03:19.458 --> 03:22.166
-When's the last time you used one?
-I said the same thing.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.333
I love to have freshly-baked sponge cake
for breakfast in bed.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.000
I did that with Nico every Sunday.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.916
We'd take turns. A new ingredient
had to be added each week

03:31.000 --> 03:32.541
and the other had to guess it.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.250
He'd improvise,
but his were tastier than mine.

03:38.625 --> 03:39.625
We can buy one.

03:40.208 --> 03:41.041
No.

03:41.541 --> 03:44.458
That's why I need to rent an apartment
with an oven.

03:46.541 --> 03:48.083
-End of story.
-Oven it is.

04:03.208 --> 04:07.250
LINA RUÍZ, 38 DESTELLO STREET, APT 3,
28039 MADRID, SPAIN

04:55.333 --> 04:56.250
How are you?

05:10.458 --> 05:11.500
You're so tanned.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.291
You look gorgeous.

05:23.666 --> 05:24.750
Some beard you have.

05:26.208 --> 05:29.875
-You look like someone else.
-Yeah. That was the point.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.375
-How was your trip?
-Good.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.750
Good, but I was dying to see you.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.250
Morning, little sparrow.

06:10.708 --> 06:11.833
It smells like anise.

06:11.916 --> 06:14.250
I think this is the best cake
I've ever made.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.250
Yummy.

06:16.791 --> 06:17.625
Try it.

06:18.666 --> 06:19.500
Come on.

06:28.458 --> 06:29.291
So?

06:31.291 --> 06:32.208
Does it have

06:33.958 --> 06:34.791
lemon in it?

06:36.083 --> 06:37.083
And cardamom.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.333
It's good.

06:45.833 --> 06:46.958
Tell me more.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.875
Well, the beginning was bad.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.666
The first few days were hard.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.625
How so?

06:58.666 --> 06:59.500
I got sick.

07:00.666 --> 07:03.166
It must have been something I ate
when I got to Zanzibar.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.125
That, plus what I was dealing with.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.000
I started wondering why I was there.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.750
And then I sent you that postcard.
I regretted it later.

07:18.041 --> 07:19.083
What postcard?

07:20.625 --> 07:22.458
-You didn't get it?
-No.

07:24.208 --> 07:25.208
That's for the best.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.208
But then things picked up. Then, I…

07:30.458 --> 07:32.375
I went to Changuu Island and…

07:32.458 --> 07:35.083
It's the most beautiful place
I've ever scuba-dived.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.250
We have to go.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.458
We will.

07:42.666 --> 07:43.833
We have plenty of time.

07:45.416 --> 07:46.416
Want some coffee?

08:01.791 --> 08:02.875
What are you humming?

08:03.583 --> 08:04.625
A Maasai song.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.791
Can you pass me the milk?

08:11.416 --> 08:14.875
My bungalow neighbors
were this nice family from Sydney.

08:14.958 --> 08:16.500
They were there to scuba dive too.

08:17.083 --> 08:20.541
They had two kids, 10 and 11.
They loved dancing to it.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.583
They were so funny.

08:22.541 --> 08:24.458
Every morning, early in the morning…

08:34.083 --> 08:36.875
-Can you imagine us like that?
-Meaning?

08:36.958 --> 08:39.583
You, me, and a couple of kids
dancing Maasai style?

08:41.666 --> 08:42.500
Yes.

08:43.958 --> 08:44.875
Sometimes I do.

08:53.958 --> 08:54.875
I missed you.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.625
I missed you too.

09:00.541 --> 09:04.250
I'm an airport

09:05.666 --> 09:08.791
Condemned to welcome you

09:09.458 --> 09:13.208
With open arms

09:14.375 --> 09:17.625
I'm a very old heart...

09:20.541 --> 09:21.750
It smells like lentils

09:23.083 --> 09:24.750
with chorizo,

09:25.750 --> 09:27.375
black pudding…

09:29.916 --> 09:30.750
Hey.

09:32.583 --> 09:34.083
-What's this?
-What?

09:35.916 --> 09:36.958
You've got gray hairs.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.375
I'm getting old.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.666
You're starting to look like your father.

09:46.916 --> 09:47.958
I'm almost ready.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.416
Wait, you were being serious?

09:53.916 --> 09:54.791
Yeah.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.458
I do think about it.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.375
Now's the time.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.333
I'd like to experience that with you.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.041
How about you?

10:17.000 --> 10:17.833
Yes.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.541
Well, maybe… not right now.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.958
I'd like to do other stuff first, but…

10:30.375 --> 10:31.250
But yeah.

10:33.125 --> 10:33.958
Okay.

10:35.708 --> 10:37.000
We've got plenty of time.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.291
...nights would never end

10:39.375 --> 10:42.333
And a new day

10:42.416 --> 10:44.541
Would never begin

10:45.750 --> 10:47.750
What for?

10:47.833 --> 10:52.916
When nighttime feats
Are daytime defeats...

10:53.000 --> 10:56.458
"My beautiful little sparrow, I've been
thinking about writing to you for days."

10:56.958 --> 11:00.291
"No matter how far away I go,
my problems always follow me."

11:00.833 --> 11:05.041
"Since my father died, I don't
just miss him. I also miss myself."

11:05.750 --> 11:07.958
"I wish things could have been different."

11:08.958 --> 11:12.791
"I have doubts about everything.
But I can't picture my life without you."

11:13.458 --> 11:15.125
"We'll talk when I get back."

11:15.666 --> 11:18.583
"In the meantime,
I'm sending you kisses from Zanzibar."

11:18.666 --> 11:23.041
…are day defeats.

11:24.333 --> 11:29.250
I'm an airport

11:29.958 --> 11:33.250
Forced to welcome you

11:33.333 --> 11:37.083
And show you the whole world

11:37.875 --> 11:42.291
I give you an open sky

11:42.958 --> 11:47.166
That you can get lost in

11:47.250 --> 11:51.791
And where you can find something real

11:52.416 --> 11:54.541
If it were up to me

11:54.625 --> 11:58.000
Nights would never end

11:58.083 --> 12:01.125
And a new day

12:01.750 --> 12:04.041
Would never begin

12:04.833 --> 12:06.916
What for?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.458
When nighttime feats

12:11.041 --> 12:15.500
Are daytime defeats

12:28.041 --> 12:30.500
A WORK OF FICTION.
ANY SIMILARITY IS COINCIDENTAL.
