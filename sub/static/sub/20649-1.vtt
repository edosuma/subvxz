00:39.372 --> 00:41.181
Fuck, yeah!

00:43.843 --> 00:47.256
This is such a big night for you.

00:49.649 --> 00:50.855
but I'm celebrating.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.195
I finally just slept
with my high-school crush.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.255
Right?

00:55.288 --> 00:56.392
Thank you.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.596
Thank you, but I swear, now he, like,

00:58.625 --> 01:01.765
expects me to go to his graduation.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.102
Like I know where I'm gonna
be in three years, right?

01:07.133 --> 01:09.443
I'm like, "Whoa!"

01:09.469 --> 01:11.676
Slow it down.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.445
Fucking kids, right?

01:13.473 --> 01:18.149
Fucking small kids.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.714
You look, like, upset.
Like, I don't fuck kids.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.781
That's a joke.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.351
Like, I would never...

01:23.383 --> 01:24.953
I shouldn't say never.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.794
That's like... you don't know...

01:27.821 --> 01:29.732
I feel like I just painted
myself in a corner there.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.669
But... that's not a good way to start.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.069
This is a beautiful theater.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.198
I should be really grateful.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.208
I worked at a fish restaurant last week.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.039
Like, I did stand-up
at a fish restaurant,

01:39.065 --> 01:40.669
just so you guys know.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.701
That's not a joke.

01:41.734 --> 01:42.906
People were, like, eating mussels,

01:42.936 --> 01:44.381
and they were just like, "Check".

01:44.404 --> 01:47.180
And I was like, "Can you just
let me try and pursue my dream?"

01:48.241 --> 01:50.778
And this place is so beautiful.

01:50.810 --> 01:51.982
I should have started off

01:52.011 --> 01:53.217
with something other than kid fucking.

01:53.246 --> 01:55.954
You guys are right.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.155
Start over. Class it up.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.824
My mom's a cunt. Hear me out.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.663
Go with me on this, you guys.

02:04.691 --> 02:09.037
I know, like, not everyone's
comfortable with that word.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.803
Half of you were like, "Ugh," right?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.070
"No, don't say that".

02:12.098 --> 02:13.600
And the other half of you
were like, "Oh, my God.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.079
What a coincidence".

02:19.172 --> 02:22.551
"That cunt should meet my cunt mom".

02:24.344 --> 02:26.415
I just... I brought her to a soccer game

02:26.446 --> 02:28.892
'cause I wanted her to see
what boundaries looked like,

02:28.915 --> 02:31.327
you know?

02:31.351 --> 02:34.457
I was like, "Look,
stop wearing my clothes".

02:34.487 --> 02:35.761
Ugh.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.325
She's always bragging
about the dumbest stuff.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.598
The other day she was telling
me, she was like,

02:39.626 --> 02:42.266
"You know, I can still fit
in my wedding dress,"

02:42.295 --> 02:46.437
I was like, "Oh, my God.
Who cares?" Right?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.472
I mean, it is weird
that she's the same size now

02:49.502 --> 02:52.244
as she was when she
was eight months pregnant,

02:52.272 --> 02:54.343
but I just...

02:59.746 --> 03:01.817
I don't think bragging's cool.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.883
Are you okay?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.486
You're, like, choking. No?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.622
Are you allergic to talent?

03:08.688 --> 03:11.225
Hi. Hi.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.930
I'm just kidding. Are you okay, really?

03:12.959 --> 03:14.996
You need anything? Okay.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.167
Oh, God.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.874
I don't need
another death under my belt.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.437
Speaking of me taking
Plan "B" last week,

03:23.469 --> 03:25.813
I...

03:25.838 --> 03:26.839
I did.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.318
You know... you know what it is?

03:28.341 --> 03:31.185
There are some people here...
it's the morning-after pill.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.623
I take it the night before
'cause I'm smart.

03:33.646 --> 03:35.648
But...

03:35.682 --> 03:38.561
some people like to...
I'm with you good people.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.826
I believe birth begins at conception.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.662
So I just, like, beat that shit.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.665
Plan Bizzle.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.540
Who's taken it? Who's taken it?

03:52.565 --> 03:53.703
Thank you.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.235
Oh, sorry, a room of heroes.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.474
Everyone's like,

03:56.502 --> 03:58.641
"Eh"

03:58.671 --> 04:01.083
This place is old. There's probably...

04:01.107 --> 04:02.347
you're probably being inseminated

04:02.375 --> 04:05.322
by the seats right now, let's be real.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.825
I did, I took it.

04:07.847 --> 04:08.951
It's over the...

04:08.982 --> 04:11.428
I went to my normal pharmacy. I walk in.

04:11.451 --> 04:13.294
The pharmacist is like, "Hey, Ame".

04:13.319 --> 04:16.129
I'm like, "Please
don't call me a nickname".

04:16.154 --> 04:17.930
He's like, "What do you want, Ambien?"

04:17.957 --> 04:19.766
I'm like, "No, I'm not addicted to that.

04:19.791 --> 04:23.103
"You guys know that.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.972
I only take that when I'm drinking".

04:27.300 --> 04:28.574
They're like, "What do you want?"

04:28.601 --> 04:30.376
I was like, "Plan and they were like...

04:30.403 --> 04:31.404
they didn't even hide it.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.747
They were like, "Ew, you whore".

04:33.773 --> 04:35.309
I was like,

04:35.341 --> 04:39.721
"You can't... you can't say that".

04:39.746 --> 04:41.521
They're like,
"You're gonna feel nauseous".

04:41.547 --> 04:42.582
I was like, "Ugh".

04:42.615 --> 04:46.256
I took it, I felt fine.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.324
I went to yoga.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.993
I'm like, "Can these people tell

04:51.024 --> 04:52.867
"I'm, like, mid-aborsh right now?

04:52.892 --> 04:53.996
This is..."

04:59.999 --> 05:02.878
This is not good. It was easy.

05:02.902 --> 05:07.976
They should call it Plan
That's how I used it.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.783
It's a great plan.
Let's start with this one.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.848
I... I don't...

05:13.880 --> 05:14.915
I don't think that's, like,

05:14.947 --> 05:16.984
adorable that I just took Plan

05:17.016 --> 05:19.428
I'm 31. Like, that's not cute at all.

05:19.452 --> 05:22.661
That's cute when you're, like...
you're, like, 21, right?

05:22.689 --> 05:24.327
You go, you sit on your mom's bed,

05:24.357 --> 05:25.597
you cry, you're like,

05:25.625 --> 05:28.629
"Oh, the condom broke".

05:28.661 --> 05:31.141
I'm like, "The what broke?"

05:33.466 --> 05:37.278
"What now? What's this you speak of?"

05:37.303 --> 05:40.443
I do, I still think I'm
20. It's so gross.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.510
Like, every bar I go to, I show my I.D.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.614
They're like, "No, that's okay".

05:45.645 --> 05:49.525
Like, "Wow, they're really relaxed here.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.722
"I hope they don't get raided.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.459
This place, I don't know".

05:54.487 --> 05:55.761
But the girls I grew up with,

05:55.788 --> 05:57.665
they're living normal
adult lives, you know?

05:57.690 --> 06:00.227
So they call me now, and they're
like, "Ame, I'm pregnant".

06:00.259 --> 06:02.899
And I still react like,
"What are you gonna do?"

06:05.231 --> 06:07.643
"No..."

06:07.667 --> 06:11.046
I'm like, "I'll drive you, I guess".

06:13.072 --> 06:14.779
They're like, "No, you're gross,"

06:14.807 --> 06:18.755
I'm like, "Oh, we keep them now".

06:18.778 --> 06:20.883
Keep them.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.122
That's my favorite reality show.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.458
You know the show Teen Mom?

06:25.485 --> 06:27.556
Or if you're from the South, Mom.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.334
They don't wait, right?

06:33.359 --> 06:34.895
This is poor planning on my part.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.338
I'm kind of dizzy.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.898
I donated blood today.

06:37.930 --> 06:42.606
That's what I call getting an AIDS test.

06:42.635 --> 06:43.841
I know, that j...

06:43.870 --> 06:46.783
people, like, hate
that joke if they have AIDS.

06:50.109 --> 06:53.886
So if you didn't laugh, get tested.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.621
Check it out.

06:56.649 --> 06:57.855
Check it out.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.330
You have it. You have it.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.027
I'm a healer.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.335
I went through a breakup this year.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.431
I was dating this guy.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.908
I walked in on him masturbating.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.774
Yeah, he's like, "Are you mad?"

07:13.800 --> 07:15.746
I'm like, "No, but you seem to be.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.009
Holy shit".

07:22.175 --> 07:23.813
I'm like, "Does it owe you money?

07:23.843 --> 07:26.483
"Why are you..."

07:28.881 --> 07:30.656
"Is that waterboarding?

07:30.683 --> 07:33.061
I don't feel safe".

07:34.554 --> 07:37.364
Me and this guy, we were so different.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.529
I knew we were... like, he
was, like, really into family.

07:39.559 --> 07:43.598
You know, and I mentioned my mom.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.939
Like, he'd never come on
the road with me on the weekends

07:45.965 --> 07:48.571
'cause he wanted to spend
time with his wife.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.376
And I just...

07:50.403 --> 07:52.576
I'm better.

07:53.706 --> 07:54.946
No, the truth is

07:54.974 --> 07:56.009
I thought he was gonna break up with me

07:56.042 --> 07:57.851
the whole time for the lamest reason...

07:57.877 --> 08:00.289
because I wouldn't swallow.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.522
But I have a nut allergy.
Like, what did he expect?

08:11.123 --> 08:14.400
I'm gonna risk my life...

08:14.427 --> 08:16.100
for his empty calories?

08:16.128 --> 08:17.232
No!

08:20.066 --> 08:22.171
Stop telling us it's good for our skin.

08:22.201 --> 08:24.647
Fuck you guys.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.885
One girl was like, "Oh, okay".

08:36.381 --> 08:37.986
Guys are so gross, right?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.188
Guys are gross.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.390
You're gross, okay?

08:41.419 --> 08:42.558
They're so gross.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.363
I had sex with a guy recently,

08:44.390 --> 08:47.860
more semen than you've
ever seen in your life.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.465
I was like, "Did you
just get out of jail?

08:50.496 --> 08:55.275
What's... what is the meaning of this?"

08:55.301 --> 08:56.371
"It's a compliment".

08:56.402 --> 09:00.111
"No, no".

09:00.139 --> 09:02.380
But that's what guys want
'cause they're so gross.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.149
If it were up to them,
we'd all look like Carrie

09:04.176 --> 09:06.019
in the prom scene at the end, just,

09:06.045 --> 09:08.252
"Ugh"

09:11.384 --> 09:13.330
No girl wants that. We don't want that.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.831
We're lazier than you.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.026
If it were up to me,

09:16.055 --> 09:17.295
the cleanup would be me taking a Q-tip

09:17.323 --> 09:18.825
going, boop, asleep.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.496
That's it.

09:20.526 --> 09:24.235
Instead I was like, "I've been slimed".

09:27.133 --> 09:30.774
"I feel like a contestant
on Double Dare right now".

09:37.443 --> 09:41.619
"Let me just get this
self-worth off me real quick".

09:43.482 --> 09:45.052
That's why I don't like porn.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.154
Well, I like to watch porn.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.823
Like, what girls in here like porn?

09:48.888 --> 09:50.162
Thank you. I love it.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.930
All the... all the whores
are in the front.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.938
This is the best.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.633
Girls in the back are, like,

09:55.661 --> 09:58.608
reading books.

09:58.631 --> 10:02.135
They're like, "50 shades of what?"

10:02.168 --> 10:03.943
That reference will not be funny

10:03.970 --> 10:05.381
by the time this show comes out.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.611
People will be like, "What a hack.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.641
Oh, God".

10:08.674 --> 10:10.950
More references about right now,

10:10.977 --> 10:13.389
how about Sandusky... no.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.760
Wasting everyone's time
in the editing room.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.627
So, yeah, I like porn.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.827
I like that casting director
one, that's funny.

10:23.856 --> 10:27.269
He never finds the right girl.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.364
What do these girls have to do?

10:29.395 --> 10:31.238
I don't like to watch the end of porn.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.140
I don't like to
watch the end of any porn,

10:33.165 --> 10:35.702
'cause guess what happens
at the end of the rainbow

10:35.735 --> 10:37.339
every time.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.646
Spoiler alert, he cums on her face.

10:39.672 --> 10:40.742
Oh!

10:40.773 --> 10:45.654
What an amazing
choose-your-own adventure

10:45.678 --> 10:48.488
that always ends exactly the same.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.926
There's never a twist, right?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.361
He's never like... the guy
is having sex with her,

10:52.385 --> 10:54.058
and he looks off camera
in her backpack, he's like,

10:54.086 --> 10:57.966
"Oh, are you reading that
Nicholas Sparks book too?"

10:59.659 --> 11:02.663
"Oh, my God. What are the chances?

11:02.695 --> 11:04.572
Let's start a bed
and breakfast together".

11:04.597 --> 11:05.598
No.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.237
He just cums on her head.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.113
We don't wanna see that. I don't want...

11:13.139 --> 11:14.550
'cause we think about that girl.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.018
Like, that poor girl,

11:16.042 --> 11:18.750
and we know, as soon as
the director yells "cut,"

11:18.778 --> 11:20.849
that she's just
stumbling around like Helen Keller

11:20.880 --> 11:23.656
looking for a towel, just where...

11:26.652 --> 11:27.756
"Did you guys go to lunch?

11:27.787 --> 11:32.099
"This isn't cool.

11:32.124 --> 11:35.401
You promise this is good for my skin?"

11:41.400 --> 11:42.674
That's so funny.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.181
Am I the only person who ever
walked in the audience

11:44.203 --> 11:45.876
during their special?

11:45.905 --> 11:47.885
Three little Asian chicks
were just like...

11:53.879 --> 11:55.358
And that's not racist, that's just...

11:55.381 --> 11:57.827
I'm just saying that that's
how all Asian people walk.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.295
Just very creepy.

11:59.318 --> 12:02.356
I know I'm in San Fran.
I should watch my back.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.299
But...

12:04.323 --> 12:07.896
I think I could take those girls.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.406
That was funny. I was watching them.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.533
Like, every time I referenced
semen, they were just like,

12:11.564 --> 12:14.044
"Oh, no".

12:14.066 --> 12:16.444
Yes.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.215
It's not for shock value.
This happens, right?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.720
Come on, you guys,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.019
we've all taken a load
somewhere we're not proud of.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.251
So...

12:30.483 --> 12:32.485
Like, my mom's here.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.597
So the guy I was dating,
he was, like, so lazy.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.571
He was one of those dudes,
like, he wouldn't go down on me.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.939
I had to become a climber
every time, you know?

12:44.964 --> 12:47.171
Head up there, just holding
on to the headboard

12:47.199 --> 12:50.772
like a nosy neighbor
peeking over the fence.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.714
I feel like Wilson
from Home Improvement.

12:52.738 --> 12:57.278
I'm like, "Hey, Tool Man, what's..."

12:58.577 --> 13:00.250
That was embarrassing up there.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.952
That's the worst dismount in the biz.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.451
I don't care how you slice it.

13:05.484 --> 13:06.963
So I'm, like, single now. I'm dating.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.431
I suck at dating.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.797
I go outwith these guys.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.802
This guy wanted to go dancing
the other night.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.929
Like, have you ever had a guy
who's trying to date you

13:13.959 --> 13:15.063
be like, "Let's dance"?

13:15.094 --> 13:16.334
It's like, "I don't know".

13:16.362 --> 13:17.773
I'm like, "It's..."

13:17.797 --> 13:20.539
I'm like, "Look, I think you
wanna go to the parade".

13:23.369 --> 13:25.781
And it's also 'cause
I'm the worst dancer.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.547
I dance like your...
like your aunt at a wedding.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.520
Like, every move I do,
I'm surprising myself.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.544
I'm just like,

13:31.577 --> 13:34.751
"Oh, wh... what?

13:34.780 --> 13:36.418
"Whoa, whoa.

13:36.448 --> 13:39.088
Nobody saw it going this way".

13:40.686 --> 13:42.427
Everybody saw it going that way.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.128
It's so awful. So I'm, like, dating now.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.159
I'm, like, going on dates.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.298
Whenever I start seeing someone,

13:49.328 --> 13:51.171
I'm, like, this alternate
version of myself.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.733
It's just like... I'm just, like,

13:52.765 --> 13:55.245
you know, trying to be
super-cool new girl.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.575
I'm like, "Let me just sweep
this crazy under the rug

13:56.602 --> 13:58.013
"for a couple months.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.210
"You don't need to...
you don't need to see this

14:00.239 --> 14:03.083
till month three".

14:03.108 --> 14:05.088
I went on a date with a guy recently,

14:05.110 --> 14:06.646
and he was, like, really hot.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.683
So I was pretending to be
a good person, you know?

14:09.715 --> 14:10.853
I was saying things like,

14:10.883 --> 14:13.159
"I love kids, and I'm not racist".

14:14.653 --> 14:16.633
Just vague lies.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.037
And you have to, like, pretend
like you wanna use a condom.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.972
I like to say something fun
when I bring it up, but honest.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.599
I'll be like, "You're
gonna wanna wear this.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.303
I've had a busy month".

14:33.739 --> 14:35.548
"It's like a Petri dish right now.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.985
I don't know what's happening".

14:39.311 --> 14:41.484
People are so upset
about my vagina right now.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.514
They're like, "No!"

14:42.548 --> 14:44.118
Here... but this guy, we went out,

14:44.149 --> 14:45.253
and he was like...

14:45.284 --> 14:46.456
you can tell when a guy dates a lot.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.260
He had, like, date questions.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.233
He was like, "if you could
have lunch with anybody,

14:50.256 --> 14:52.463
living or dead, who would it be?"

14:52.491 --> 14:53.492
I thought about it.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.663
I answered honestly, I was like,

14:54.693 --> 14:56.434
"Mark Twain. I think he was hilarious".

14:56.462 --> 15:01.207
And he goes, "Pfft, Amy,
it's got to be somebody real".

15:04.136 --> 15:06.275
I was like, "Oh, you're legit retarded.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.114
That's so cute".

15:09.408 --> 15:13.515
"I'm gonna sleep
with a retarded person".

15:13.545 --> 15:15.547
I did.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.289
So I've been on the road a lot lately,

15:21.320 --> 15:22.993
and every town I go to,
you have to do, like,

15:23.022 --> 15:24.592
local press, you know?

15:24.623 --> 15:26.603
<i>The, like, Greenville Who Gives A Shit.</i>

15:26.625 --> 15:28.332
Like, everybody has a paper.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.500
And they all ask the same
questions every week.

15:31.530 --> 15:32.668
They ask me the same, exact question.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.109
They're just like,

15:34.133 --> 15:37.512
"What's the hardest part
about being a female comedian?

15:37.536 --> 15:39.914
What is it? What's the hardest part?"

15:39.939 --> 15:41.418
And, like, what would you guess?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.349
Well, it's the rape.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.862
The three Asian chicks
just walked back in here,

15:56.889 --> 15:59.733
and I said that, and they went...

16:02.895 --> 16:05.501
No, but it is. It's all the rapings.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.010
No... but they ask...
they're just like...

16:07.032 --> 16:08.136
and I guess it's a normal question,

16:08.167 --> 16:09.475
"Is it harder for female comics?

16:09.501 --> 16:10.673
Is it harder?"

16:10.703 --> 16:11.704
And it's not.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.216
Like, they think we just get up here

16:13.238 --> 16:14.649
and just bleed all over the stage.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.675
I'm just, "Oh, my ovaries.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.588
How do I keep them in my body?"

16:20.679 --> 16:22.352
Like, it's totally not harder.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.521
It's harder to be a chick
in general, for sure.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.827
That sucks. That's not fun.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.628
Right? Right girls?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.100
No, it is. It sucks.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.466
Just in terms of laziness.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.528
Like, look at the guys
you're here with tonight, okay?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.301
Some of them bangable, not all of them.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.864
Let's be real.

16:37.896 --> 16:41.400
Let's keep it honest, okay?

16:41.433 --> 16:44.505
But, like, what did you do
to get ready, you know?

16:44.536 --> 16:46.516
Like, how long did it
take you to get ready?

16:46.538 --> 16:49.781
You didn't get ready is the answer.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.584
Guys don't do shit.

16:52.611 --> 16:53.885
They put a shirt on,

16:53.912 --> 16:56.324
give themselves one of these
in the mirror, they're out.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.057
They're like, "I did it, bro.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.122
I fucking did it".

17:02.154 --> 17:04.531
"What did you do?"

17:06.325 --> 17:07.963
Some guys take a little more time.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.801
I dated a guy from Philly for a while.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.171
Is anybody here from Philadelphia?

17:11.195 --> 17:12.196
Yeah?

17:12.231 --> 17:14.268
Okay, some sassy babes.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.334
No dudes, though.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.641
But tell me if I'm right about this.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.672
Well, just agree, 'cause
this is for my TV special.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.951
Like, those dudes will beat you to death

17:23.976 --> 17:26.286
with a sack of batteries,

17:26.310 --> 17:28.348
but they get their eyebrows waxed.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.553
You know the kind of guy
I'm talking about?

17:30.582 --> 17:33.859
I was at a Met game... thank you.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.992
And... it was Mets, Phillies,

17:37.022 --> 17:39.024
and I'm sitting behind third base.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.301
And these huge Philly meatheads
are heckling David Wright.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.238
They're like, "You suck,
Wright. You're the worst.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.435
We hate you".

17:45.464 --> 17:48.877
And so I said,
"You're very attractive!"

17:48.901 --> 17:52.542
And the biggest one
of them goes, "True".

17:59.478 --> 18:01.424
But most guys don't do shit.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.154
Like, look at the shirts
you guys are wearing.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.593
Every one of you that I can see,

18:04.616 --> 18:05.993
you could have worn that
when you were a toddler

18:06.018 --> 18:07.019
on picture day.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.123
Every one. No difference.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.395
Check it out.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.425
But look at the
beautiful girls you're with.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.268
Look at... it's so much work for us.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.207
It takes me 90 minutes
to look this mediocre.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.404
90 minutes.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.777
Tonight it took eight hours, okay?

18:23.802 --> 18:25.611
I slept sitting up. I slept like this.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.275
It's so much work.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.183
Oh, we're like clowns.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.347
We are circus freaks, women, we are.

18:31.376 --> 18:35.347
We... we put paint on
our faces like warriors.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.984
We're... I'm wearing stilts.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.017
We wear stilts. We wear heels all night.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.031
And we put a string
in our buttholes, just...

18:43.889 --> 18:45.732
"Ah...

18:45.757 --> 18:48.431
am I pretty?"

18:48.460 --> 18:50.371
We wear jewelry, shiny shit...

18:50.395 --> 18:51.999
"Look over here.
Follow me to the altar".

18:57.302 --> 18:58.713
Ugh.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.980
It sucks. It sucks.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.350
I think as a woman as you get older,

19:03.375 --> 19:05.719
you get lazier just by looking around.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.225
No, I just... I work in Vegas a lot.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.527
That doesn't sound awesome.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.533
But I do stand-up in Vegas a lot,

19:16.555 --> 19:18.728
and I see these packs of young girls

19:18.757 --> 19:20.759
that still have the energy, you know?

19:20.792 --> 19:21.793
Just a pack of girls

19:21.827 --> 19:23.932
all wearing tube dresses, right?

19:23.962 --> 19:25.942
And just... the heels they can't handle.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.173
They have to hold each other
and do, like, Wizard of Oz walk,

19:29.201 --> 19:32.910
chain gang kind of...

19:32.938 --> 19:34.349
They all look identical.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.375
It looks like a whore computer
just shot out a prototype,

19:36.408 --> 19:37.648
and they just started walking.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.654
"Tonight, tonight's
the night, you guys".

19:44.149 --> 19:46.095
I like seeing them
at the end of the night,

19:46.118 --> 19:48.291
you know, like it didn't work out.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.698
They're carrying their heels.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.360
They're crying their makeup off.

19:52.391 --> 19:53.631
It looks like they're melting.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.195
"Why didn't anyone pick me?"

19:58.030 --> 20:00.203
"You have puke on your tube, Amber".

20:04.770 --> 20:06.113
It's all work.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.049
It's work having a vagina. That's work.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.849
Guys don't think
that it's work, but it is.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.685
You think it just shows up
like that to the event?

20:12.711 --> 20:15.351
It doesn't.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.688
Every night it's like getting it ready

20:16.715 --> 20:20.128
for its first quinceañera, believe me.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.459
Gets an updo, it cries.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.798
It's a lot of work.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.361
It didn't used to be work.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.100
I know that from watching vintage porn.

20:30.128 --> 20:33.234
It was no work.

20:33.265 --> 20:34.869
Zero.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.574
I even... I remember my mom
bottomless when I was a kid.

20:37.603 --> 20:38.604
And it was just...

20:38.637 --> 20:41.584
poof!

20:41.607 --> 20:43.746
It looked like the black
smoke monster from Lost

20:43.775 --> 20:45.379
was just following her.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.459
It's like, "Is Mom being
swarmed by bees?

20:52.484 --> 20:53.929
"What is...

20:53.952 --> 20:56.364
"Is that a tumbleweed?

20:56.388 --> 20:58.959
We're not even in the West".

21:00.726 --> 21:02.831
And then something happened.
I don't know.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.499
Like, 10, 15 years ago,

21:04.529 --> 21:07.066
all the dudes got together
and had, like, a meeting.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.911
Like a fantasy football
draft about our privates.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.574
They were like, "We can't get in there.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.642
"It's like Vietnam trying to...

21:15.674 --> 21:18.120
What do we do?"

21:18.143 --> 21:19.816
And then they just came to
us, and they were just like,

21:19.845 --> 21:23.452
"Ladies, would you mind

21:23.482 --> 21:26.929
looking like babies again?"

21:29.921 --> 21:32.424
And we were like...

21:32.457 --> 21:33.561
"Like, what do you mean?

21:33.592 --> 21:37.267
Just clean up the sides
a little bit or..."

21:37.296 --> 21:40.300
"The whole enchilada".

21:40.332 --> 21:44.781
And we were like,
"Yeah, that's not super weird".

21:44.803 --> 21:47.215
So now we go, we get it done.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.014
We have to go get it done.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.520
Ugh, yeah, like, that does... she...

21:50.542 --> 21:51.714
we go and get it done, guys.

21:51.743 --> 21:52.881
Like, it doesn't just happen.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.254
I don't care how cool your girl is.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.316
She doesn't have, like,
alopecia of the crotch.

21:56.348 --> 21:59.727
It just falls out in
the shape of your initials.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.890
That's not what happens.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.466
That's not how it goes down, no.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.266
We get it done.

22:08.293 --> 22:09.772
We have to go see a woman,

22:09.795 --> 22:14.266
usually from a third-world country.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.801
It's never from, like...

22:15.834 --> 22:17.313
like, it's never me
that comes and gets you

22:17.336 --> 22:18.644
from the waiting room.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.172
Like, I'll never be like,
"Hi, I'm Ashley.

22:20.205 --> 22:21.411
I'm here to take care of your pussy".

22:21.440 --> 22:22.817
Like, no.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.581
"Pussy!"

22:27.612 --> 22:30.092
No, it's not...

22:30.115 --> 22:31.526
that's not how it goes.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.496
Like, the chick who
does it to me in New York,

22:33.518 --> 22:35.862
I think she's from, like,
the killing fields of Cambodia.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.696
Like, this poor woman...

22:37.723 --> 22:41.466
I can tell, like, she has
seen some shit, you know?

22:43.862 --> 22:45.205
She has been through it,

22:45.230 --> 22:48.837
and she was, like, a doctor there.

22:48.867 --> 22:52.838
And now she does this, and she hates me.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.545
And she doesn't even hide it.
I walk in, she's like, "Ugh".

22:55.574 --> 22:57.417
I'm like, "Sorry".

22:59.044 --> 23:01.024
But she should, she should
hate me because I'm like...

23:01.046 --> 23:02.957
we're the worst, white, entitled girls.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.358
I walk in chewing gum,

23:04.383 --> 23:05.384
I'm on my phone.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.159
I'm just like...

23:08.186 --> 23:10.427
I'm like, "Don't get any
wax on my new UGGs.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.901
What?"

23:15.394 --> 23:18.238
She's like, "My parents
were murdered in front of me".

23:18.263 --> 23:20.243
I'm like, "I'm on the phone. What?"

23:23.602 --> 23:25.604
"It's about True Blood.
Give me one sec".

23:26.938 --> 23:28.781
She hates me, but she wins.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.878
Like, those chicks win every time,

23:30.909 --> 23:32.479
'cause what they do,
and I always forget this,

23:32.511 --> 23:34.855
they go... she goes and gets a mirror,

23:34.880 --> 23:37.690
and she shows it to me.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.890
She shows me my own vagina.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.230
And I have to act
like I'm not horrified.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.000
And I'm horrified.

23:49.027 --> 23:50.938
It's the worst thing in the world.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.964
And what she's saying in that moment is,

23:52.998 --> 23:56.571
"Are you happy now, you dumb bitch?

23:56.601 --> 23:59.605
You just paid me to assault you".

24:00.939 --> 24:02.941
"And now you look like a toddler.

24:02.974 --> 24:07.081
Is that what... is that cool, yeah?"

24:07.112 --> 24:08.386
And it's not cool.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.450
It's the worst thing
you'll ever see in your life.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.120
It's red.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.322
It looks angry.

24:13.351 --> 24:14.955
It looks like an old man frowning.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.364
Just, "No!"

24:19.658 --> 24:23.037
"Visit me!"

24:27.065 --> 24:28.373
"Birds!"

24:28.400 --> 24:30.141
I don't know. Old
people like birds, right?

24:30.168 --> 24:31.374
I don't know.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.508
They're always like, "Oh, look, a bird".

24:33.538 --> 24:37.247
Ugh. It's so much work.

24:38.076 --> 24:39.487
I think guys have it easier.

24:39.511 --> 24:40.956
I'm not sure.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.550
What do you guys think? Yeah, you do?

24:43.582 --> 24:45.960
Did you ever see an
uncircumcised penis?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.895
You did? Did you know...

24:47.919 --> 24:49.262
did you know you were gonna see it?

24:49.287 --> 24:52.131
No, it's always a
fucking surprise party, right?

24:53.959 --> 24:55.461
It's a big... it's him, right?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.202
It's him.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.800
Wait. Here's the funniest thing.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.777
I'm sorry that everyone knows
about your penis now.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.302
But here's the best part,

25:03.335 --> 25:05.542
he's wearing a shirt
that says "Browncoats".

25:05.570 --> 25:07.880
Now, if that's not funny...

25:10.175 --> 25:11.176
And that's what it looks like.

25:11.209 --> 25:14.383
It looks like your penis is
wearing a little brown coat...

25:15.680 --> 25:18.286
if you've seen one.

25:18.316 --> 25:20.125
You just... nobody ever
tells you, right?

25:20.151 --> 25:21.789
He didn't tell you.
They don't tell you shit.

25:21.820 --> 25:22.890
They're just like, boom,

25:22.921 --> 25:25.299
reunited with Snuffleupagus, enjoy.

25:25.323 --> 25:28.065
Enjoy.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.629
You guys are so cute.

25:29.661 --> 25:31.197
Why don't they tell us?

25:31.229 --> 25:32.606
Tell... tell me.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.542
We have to become
award-winning actresses.

25:34.566 --> 25:35.772
Like, "Oh, no. That's totally cool.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.110
"Mom, can you come pick me up?

25:39.804 --> 25:43.183
"I don't know. It's wearing,
like, a hat or, like, a cape.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.916
Like, a brown coat type thing".

25:51.850 --> 25:53.352
Why don't they tell us?

25:53.385 --> 25:56.025
I would tell you if I had
an extra flap over my clitoris.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.330
I'd give you a heads-up. I would.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.501
I'd be like, "You're gonna
encounter a wizard.

26:02.527 --> 26:05.371
"Keep going.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.173
"Go.

26:08.199 --> 26:09.769
Take this compass".

26:09.801 --> 26:12.577
I'd make it exciting,

26:12.604 --> 26:13.639
play the music from Zelda.

26:13.672 --> 26:14.878
It'd be great.

26:16.841 --> 26:18.514
Men don't care. They don't tell you.

26:18.543 --> 26:23.219
I hooked up with a guy one
time that had no testicles.

26:23.248 --> 26:28.561
Count them, zero "testicalo".

26:28.587 --> 26:29.861
You think he brought that up at dinner?

26:29.888 --> 26:30.889
'Cause he didn't.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.402
I got to find out in real time.

26:35.493 --> 26:37.029
It was dark in the room.

26:37.062 --> 26:40.043
Let me paint the romantic picture here.

26:40.065 --> 26:43.274
And I went right to the spot
I know them to always be,

26:43.301 --> 26:46.805
no GPS necessary.

26:46.838 --> 26:49.910
I picked up the main event and noth...

26:49.941 --> 26:51.420
I felt like a girl learning Braille.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.013
I just kept...

26:56.147 --> 26:57.592
And, like, we don't...

26:57.616 --> 26:59.061
like, girls don't care about your balls.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.358
Like, no one care...

27:00.385 --> 27:01.955
like, I would never call
my sister the morning after

27:01.987 --> 27:02.988
and be like,

27:03.021 --> 27:06.332
"Hey, okay. So, like, the sex was lame,

27:06.358 --> 27:09.931
"but this guy's balls..."

27:14.933 --> 27:16.606
No.

27:16.635 --> 27:20.412
But when they're
not there, you miss 'em.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.884
They're like grandparents.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.959
Thank you.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.364
I like that that's the one
that was too much for you guys.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.959
You're like, "Rape, AIDS, whatevs.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.062
Grandparents? Whoa!"

27:44.429 --> 27:47.535
So, yeah, the way I saw
an uncircumcised penis...

27:47.565 --> 27:50.409
I had met this guy
at a bar. He was French.

27:50.435 --> 27:51.573
So I should have known,

27:51.603 --> 27:52.707
but I didn't know
he was actually French.

27:52.737 --> 27:53.875
I thought we were
both just, like, wasted

27:53.905 --> 27:55.543
and faking the accent, you know?

27:57.442 --> 28:00.889
I was like, "Rosetta Stone!"

28:00.912 --> 28:03.324
'Cause I do, I can
only drink beer and wine now

28:03.348 --> 28:04.554
'cause I, like, my parents are...

28:04.582 --> 28:06.152
anybody have alcoholic parents?

28:06.184 --> 28:07.720
Anybody in here?

28:07.752 --> 28:09.390
Oh, no, everybody was raised awesomely?

28:10.822 --> 28:11.823
Like, my dad

28:11.856 --> 28:13.392
used to apologize to me

28:13.425 --> 28:17.373
for missing
volleyball games that he was at.

28:17.395 --> 28:20.501
So, anyway, I meet
this French guy and...

28:20.532 --> 28:22.978
'cause I don't think that's
a cute accent on dudes, right?

28:23.001 --> 28:24.480
The French accent.

28:24.502 --> 28:26.607
It just... it makes my vagina
shut like a steel trap,

28:26.638 --> 28:28.743
Just pshh!

28:28.773 --> 28:31.617
I mean, thank God
for that other hole, but...

28:34.112 --> 28:36.615
My butthole.

28:36.648 --> 28:37.718
Oh, you knew.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.319
Okay, you knew.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.797
So I went home with this French guy,

28:42.821 --> 28:44.528
'cause he said something adorable like,

28:44.556 --> 28:46.035
"I have an apartment".

28:47.726 --> 28:49.205
I was like, "Oh".

28:49.227 --> 28:52.003
So we go... I go home with him,

28:52.030 --> 28:53.441
and we're, like, making out.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.876
He was very sensual.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.140
He's one of those dudes,
like, he started to pick me up,

28:57.168 --> 28:58.772
and then he realized
he was in over his head,

28:58.803 --> 29:00.805
and I got planted back down.

29:02.607 --> 29:05.087
It's hard to feel sexy
when a dudes winded

29:05.110 --> 29:07.351
from trying to hoist you.

29:07.378 --> 29:08.982
His, like, legs are shaking.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.015
He's, like, wiping sweat.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.585
I'm like, "Can you just put me..."

29:12.617 --> 29:14.290
I tried to land cute like a gymnast.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.299
I was like...

29:16.321 --> 29:18.232
No, but I do...

29:18.256 --> 29:19.360
but I know I have a body type.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.267
Like, I know, like, I'm not a twig.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.169
Like, if a cheerleading
pyramids being made,

29:23.194 --> 29:24.605
I know I'm a base.

29:24.629 --> 29:27.075
Like, I get right down...

29:27.098 --> 29:28.338
I'm not like, "Hoist me up on top

29:28.366 --> 29:29.811
"like a star tonight, you guys.

29:29.834 --> 29:30.835
I wanna fly".

29:30.869 --> 29:32.576
Like, I know where I am.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.518
I know my body type the way
guys hit on me at bars,

29:36.541 --> 29:37.542
like, when it happens.

29:37.575 --> 29:38.576
And it's usually my idea.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.680
I'm usually like, "Hey".

29:39.711 --> 29:40.712
And they're like, "No, thanks".

29:40.745 --> 29:41.746
And I'm like, "Hey!"

29:41.780 --> 29:43.259
And they're like, "Oh".

29:47.252 --> 29:48.663
But when I do get hit on...

29:48.686 --> 29:50.427
Like, this guy just came
up to me, and he was from,

29:50.455 --> 29:52.435
like, Texas or somewhere I'm not going.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.166
And...

29:56.194 --> 29:57.571
and he comes over, and he's like,

29:57.595 --> 30:00.599
"Hey, I like you.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.873
You're sturdy".

30:06.070 --> 30:07.481
I'm like, "I'm sorry?"

30:07.505 --> 30:08.950
He's like, "You look like
you could take a punch".

30:08.973 --> 30:10.975
I'm like, "Oh".

30:11.009 --> 30:14.183
Oh, don't I feel like
the belle of the ball.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.789
So I'm making out with Frenchinator,

30:19.818 --> 30:21.525
and... he did...

30:21.553 --> 30:22.964
he put... he, like, gave up right away,

30:22.987 --> 30:24.625
'cause he's French, I guess.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.227
And...

30:28.893 --> 30:32.807
Oh, my God. Thank you.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.833
So we're making out, and... he...

30:34.866 --> 30:36.812
he pulled his dick out immediately.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.647
He must have been thinking
like, "She's the one".

30:40.672 --> 30:42.117
And I'm looking at it.

30:42.140 --> 30:45.553
I'm just like, "What... what is that?"

30:46.578 --> 30:48.649
"Are we having, like, a pillow fight?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.125
"What's...

30:50.148 --> 30:53.686
Why is the gnome from
Travelocity in your underpants?"

30:56.588 --> 30:58.568
But, like, you can't...
guys are sensitive too.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.297
I couldn't do what I was,
like, thinking, like...

31:00.325 --> 31:01.360
"Aah!"

31:01.392 --> 31:04.032
Like, run down the
five stories of his walk-up.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.973
I had to be, like, a team
player and be like,

31:05.997 --> 31:07.340
"All right, here we go".

31:07.365 --> 31:08.844
Just, like, fighting through the skin

31:08.867 --> 31:10.312
trying to find his actual pe...

31:10.335 --> 31:12.747
I felt like a magician
with the scarves, I'm just...

31:17.242 --> 31:20.314
Waiting for a dove
to hit me in the face.

31:23.748 --> 31:25.819
It sucks getting older as a chick.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.160
In your 20s, you're
just like, "Life is awesome.

31:28.186 --> 31:31.724
Everybody wants to fuck me, you guys!"

31:31.756 --> 31:33.463
Then you turn 30, and you're like,

31:33.491 --> 31:35.732
"You guys?"

31:35.760 --> 31:38.502
It's like a bus that never comes.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.475
But as I'm getting older,
what I'm doing now

31:40.498 --> 31:42.535
is I'm just making sure
I'm the best-looking one

31:42.567 --> 31:43.568
of my friends.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.205
It's really easy.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.877
I cut certain people out of my life.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.377
And I now hand-select
strangers off of Facebook

31:52.410 --> 31:55.016
and surround myself with
real trolls and reptiles.

31:55.046 --> 31:57.151
You should see these monsters.

31:57.181 --> 31:59.491
I had a friend, Nikki,
she kept losing weight.

31:59.517 --> 32:03.294
I took her out of my phone.
Fuck her, I'm sorry.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.426
But there's one chick
I've been friends with forever.

32:05.456 --> 32:06.799
Her name is Sabina.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.394
Like, she's gorgeous,

32:08.426 --> 32:10.133
and of course she is,
with the name Sabina.

32:10.161 --> 32:12.971
Like, what a white,
annoying name, right?

32:12.997 --> 32:14.670
You have to be so hot to
pull off names like that,

32:14.699 --> 32:16.406
like Sabina, Priscilla.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.380
You can't have, like,
a bum knee and a lazy eye

32:18.403 --> 32:20.815
and be like, "I'm Sabina".

32:22.807 --> 32:24.150
It's like, "Nice try.

32:24.175 --> 32:25.347
"We're gonna call you Bertha, bitch.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.788
"But that was cute.

32:27.812 --> 32:29.416
That was cute".

32:29.447 --> 32:30.926
Guys go crazy over her.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.724
I never get hit on like that.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.492
The only time I get hit on
is last call at the bar.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.760
Right?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.632
That's when I shine, I'm telling you.

32:39.657 --> 32:41.136
What a weird time of night, right?

32:41.159 --> 32:42.729
The lights go on.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.639
It just feels real rape-y
all of a sudden.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.108
Post-apocalyptic.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.337
Something happens to the men.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.902
They're just like, "I need a woman".

32:49.934 --> 32:51.607
Like, they all just start
pacing like gorillas.

32:54.272 --> 32:57.116
Their eyes widen.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.246
It looks like they can only see by heat.

32:59.277 --> 33:02.315
They're like, "What?" Like Predator.

33:05.049 --> 33:07.154
I see some dude in a full blackout

33:07.185 --> 33:08.323
just walking at me,

33:08.353 --> 33:10.424
like a zombie just pointing
at his own dick.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.298
Like, "Here".

33:15.059 --> 33:17.039
I'm like, "I'll get us a cab".

33:22.900 --> 33:25.005
I know I make it sound
like I'm so slutty up here,

33:25.036 --> 33:26.777
but I'm... I've
only been with four people,

33:26.804 --> 33:28.715
and that was a weird night.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.086
That's my business.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.421
Oh, it doesn't matter
what you do, ladies.

33:35.446 --> 33:37.187
Every guy is gonna
leave you for an Asian woman,

33:37.215 --> 33:39.024
and you know that.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.154
That's right,

33:40.184 --> 33:42.892
I'm saying it in San Francisco,
in the hotbed.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.298
In the hotbed.

33:45.323 --> 33:48.236
I get it. I can't compete
with an Asian chick.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.761
I can't. They're better.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.273
I've been thinking
about this. I did the math.

33:51.295 --> 33:53.866
I know that's their thing, but I did it.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.604
I've been thinking about
it. I can't win.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.173
How can I compete with an Asian chick?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.616
They're smarter.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.779
They have naturally silky hair.

34:04.809 --> 34:08.552
This Jew denial took
me, like, 40 minutes.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.058
They laugh like this

34:10.081 --> 34:13.688
'cause they know men
hate when women speak.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.531
They're better.

34:17.554 --> 34:19.534
They're just better.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.764
And how do they bring it
on home for the win?

34:21.793 --> 34:24.967
Oh, the smallest vaginae in the game.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.565
I can't compete with that.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.599
What do I have? What am I...

34:28.632 --> 34:30.442
I've got a B.A. in Theater and HPV.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.915
No one's buying my stock.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.646
I am plummeting.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.947
I'm going to black guys.

34:37.975 --> 34:39.420
That's what I'm trying to do.

34:39.444 --> 34:40.821
That's what I'm doing, yeah.

34:40.844 --> 34:42.290
I've... I can't believe
I've never done it.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.918
I'm built for it. It
seems weird I haven't.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.485
Gotta go for the black guy.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.121
Have you ever... black guy? Yeah.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.632
She's like, "Yeah".

34:50.655 --> 34:52.635
She's like, "Yes, look at my shirt.

34:52.657 --> 34:53.965
You know I fuck black guys".

34:53.991 --> 34:55.299
How cute are you?

34:55.326 --> 34:56.929
You're so cute. You're hot.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.406
I'm not gay.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.500
I've caught a finger,
but you get what I'm saying.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.005
Black guys are the future.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.174
Some chicks are scared.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.013
You know what they say,
"Once you go black,

35:08.039 --> 35:09.347
your parents don't talk to you anymore".

35:09.373 --> 35:11.512
Something like that. I don't know.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.284
I don't know.
Something, like, to that effect.

35:14.312 --> 35:16.223
But black guys...

35:16.247 --> 35:17.624
No, I want to do it.

35:17.648 --> 35:19.559
I almost did it last weekend.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.086
I was... like, after the show,

35:21.119 --> 35:24.726
I was standing out, and...
and I was trying to sell my CDs,

35:24.755 --> 35:26.860
and people were like, "No, thanks".

35:26.891 --> 35:30.361
And not even of my stand-up.

35:30.394 --> 35:32.499
Just, like, some shit I needed
to get rid of, you know,

35:32.530 --> 35:34.942
<i>like, the Forrest Gump soundtrack,</i>

35:34.966 --> 35:36.570
just some Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott.

35:36.601 --> 35:37.705
I'm like, "I don't need this".

35:37.735 --> 35:40.011
But, no, this dude comes up to me,

35:40.037 --> 35:41.812
this black guy, and he was into it,

35:41.839 --> 35:43.284
'cause, come on.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.809
And...

35:44.842 --> 35:49.018
he walks over, and he's
like, "I'm Derek".

35:49.046 --> 35:51.151
And I was like, "Derek?"

35:51.182 --> 35:53.321
He's like, "Derek".

35:53.351 --> 35:55.456
And he had on, like, a nice shirt,

35:55.486 --> 35:58.262
and he had, like, a job.

35:59.590 --> 36:05.199
And I was like, "No, I want a brotha".

36:05.229 --> 36:09.041
If I'm gonna do it, I wanna
really do it, you know?

36:09.066 --> 36:10.272
Not Derek.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.541
I want him to, like,
not even have a name,

36:11.569 --> 36:12.570
just like nicknames.

36:12.603 --> 36:13.741
Everyone's like, "Pookie!"

36:13.771 --> 36:16.183
He's like, "What's up?"

36:16.207 --> 36:17.686
No job.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.211
We need, like, a ton of lube,
but just, like, for his elbows.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.155
You know what I'm talking about?

36:23.614 --> 36:25.150
Oh, that was insanely racist?

36:25.183 --> 36:28.062
You're right. You're right.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.529
I love joking about race.

36:31.556 --> 36:32.660
It's, like, my favorite.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.998
I was talking about this the other day.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.199
I was hanging outwith
literally all my black friend.

36:37.228 --> 36:40.437
And...

36:40.464 --> 36:44.207
And... and I remember
I was like, "Tamambe,"

36:44.235 --> 36:46.215
or whatever.

36:46.237 --> 36:50.242
Tapestry... it's something
wild, you know?

36:51.542 --> 36:53.044
It's something crazy.

36:53.077 --> 36:55.182
I mean, that's why they need
Google in the delivery room,

36:55.213 --> 36:56.214
I think, right?

36:56.247 --> 36:57.248
It's everywhere else.

36:57.281 --> 36:58.555
Why not there, right?

36:58.583 --> 36:59.687
So when her mom was like,

36:59.717 --> 37:02.823
I'm gonna name you "Tamambo".

37:02.853 --> 37:06.801
Google would show up and say,
"Did you mean Jennifer?"

37:12.697 --> 37:14.176
And her mom would be like,

37:14.198 --> 37:16.508
"Yes, Google, I did mean Jennifer.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.377
Thank you".

37:20.338 --> 37:21.612
No, Tamambe.

37:21.639 --> 37:26.281
So I'm hanging out with Tapioca and...

37:26.310 --> 37:28.551
Tempura or something,
and what was she saying?

37:28.579 --> 37:30.081
She... she was like, "Girl".

37:30.114 --> 37:32.151
Like, I won't do some racist impression,

37:32.183 --> 37:33.184
so don't worry.

37:33.217 --> 37:34.992
But she was like, "Girl!"

37:42.560 --> 37:44.233
I mean, we were, like,
mid-double Dutch,

37:44.262 --> 37:47.471
and...

37:47.498 --> 37:48.499
And I'm just like,

37:48.532 --> 37:51.012
"Stop yelling. We're not at the movies".

37:55.706 --> 37:58.710
Thank you.

37:58.743 --> 38:01.155
Thank you.

38:01.178 --> 38:02.680
I'm glad you guys laughed at that.

38:02.713 --> 38:05.922
That does not always work,
I'll be honest with you.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.191
I mean, nothing works
100% of the time, right?

38:08.219 --> 38:09.596
Except Mexicans.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.429
I've noticed...

38:12.423 --> 38:13.766
That's the one?

38:13.791 --> 38:15.236
Boo! Right?

38:15.259 --> 38:16.738
Boo, Mexicans.

38:16.761 --> 38:17.796
I hear ya.

38:17.828 --> 38:19.330
You guys are

38:19.363 --> 38:21.468
preaching to the choir.

38:25.069 --> 38:27.049
So, ass play, you guys,
what do you guys think?

38:27.071 --> 38:28.175
For or against?

38:28.205 --> 38:30.811
Every night? Okay.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.616
I've dealt with two kinds of guys

38:32.643 --> 38:35.556
when it comes to my personal asshole.

38:37.415 --> 38:40.191
There's the kind of guy that
never acknowledges it, right?

38:40.217 --> 38:42.197
Like, the whole time
you're together just never...

38:42.219 --> 38:44.221
which is awesome because who
needs the extra maintenance?

38:44.255 --> 38:45.461
Can I get what-what, ladies?

38:45.489 --> 38:46.729
What-what!

38:46.757 --> 38:49.738
Thanks, sister friends.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.500
That guy's awesome, right?

38:53.531 --> 38:54.976
You know what you're
getting with that guy.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.774
And then there's the other kind of guy

38:56.801 --> 38:59.975
who goes for it immediately.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.006
Like, you're not even fully kissing yet,

39:02.039 --> 39:04.383
and he's trying to grab
you like a bowling ball.

39:04.408 --> 39:06.911
You're like, "No!"

39:09.780 --> 39:11.885
He's like, "You said
you like Jeff Dunham".

39:11.916 --> 39:14.624
You're like, "No!"

39:16.854 --> 39:19.801
You can't trust those guys, all right?

39:19.824 --> 39:21.394
So I was dating the first kind of guy,

39:21.425 --> 39:22.802
no ass play.

39:22.827 --> 39:24.431
Like, the sex was very vanilla.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.874
There was no funny business,
no dirty talk.

39:26.897 --> 39:29.138
If I sent him a naughty photo,
he would just write back,

39:29.166 --> 39:33.080
"Thanks," like I
sent him a fax he needed.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.051
Like I had forwarded him an e-vite.

39:37.274 --> 39:38.912
So we were together for, like, years,

39:38.943 --> 39:40.616
and one night, out of nowhere,

39:40.644 --> 39:42.123
we're at dinner, and he's like,

39:42.146 --> 39:44.183
"I'd like to talk about something.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.355
I'd like to talk about ass play".

39:47.385 --> 39:49.626
And I'm like, "Is that a Broadway show?

39:50.821 --> 39:54.735
"That show sounds awesome.
Let's go see that show".

39:54.759 --> 39:56.261
And he's like, "No, ass play".

39:56.293 --> 39:58.170
And as I'm asking him questions,

39:58.195 --> 40:00.038
I realize he hasn't thought
it through at all.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.907
'Cause I was just like,
"Do you mean on you or me?"

40:01.932 --> 40:03.070
And he was like, "Oh".

40:03.100 --> 40:05.478
I was like, "Oh, Jesus, no".

40:07.171 --> 40:10.277
This is not a brainstorm sesh here.

40:10.307 --> 40:13.811
Your PowerPoint, buddy.

40:13.844 --> 40:15.653
So that night, I was like,

40:15.679 --> 40:16.953
"I'm gonna call him on his bluff".

40:16.981 --> 40:18.654
I don't usually joke
around in the bedroom,

40:18.682 --> 40:20.423
but I was like, "Fuck this guy".

40:20.451 --> 40:21.759
So...

40:23.120 --> 40:26.590
I'm like, "This J.V. player
is gonna get it from me," so...

40:30.494 --> 40:32.167
So we're, like, making
out, and I'm just like,

40:32.196 --> 40:36.303
"Psst, where is all the ass play?"

40:36.333 --> 40:41.112
And like a frightened child,
he goes, "Tonight?"

40:43.107 --> 40:45.747
And I'm like, "Uh-huh".

40:45.776 --> 40:49.019
And he can't think... he goes,
"Well, did you shower?"

40:49.046 --> 40:50.582
I said, "I'm not gonna answer that,

40:50.614 --> 40:52.287
'cause I'm not a homeless woman".

40:52.316 --> 40:55.695
Just some schizophrenic
with a cart like,

40:55.719 --> 40:58.825
"Wash me!"

41:02.126 --> 41:04.265
So he can't think of any
other way to stall,

41:04.295 --> 41:05.774
so this is what he does, okay?

41:05.796 --> 41:07.070
This is my asshole.

41:07.097 --> 41:11.705
This is his finger. He goes like this.

41:11.735 --> 41:13.942
And he holds it there,

41:13.971 --> 41:16.508
like he was checking it for a pulse.

41:18.275 --> 41:19.811
Like he thought a groundhog
might pop out,

41:19.844 --> 41:21.414
and he'd have
to Whac-A-Mole it.

41:24.348 --> 41:26.521
And then I fist him

41:26.550 --> 41:29.997
like you wouldn't believe.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.262
He's dead.

41:38.295 --> 41:40.297
Oh, God, you guys are awesome.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.332
I... seriously,

41:41.365 --> 41:42.776
sometimes that goes so awkward,

41:42.800 --> 41:44.507
and during a set, I
just want to, like, tap out.

41:44.535 --> 41:45.980
I've had this image.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.710
Not like a wrestling tap-out,

41:47.738 --> 41:49.843
but just sort of soft-shoe
out of the room

41:49.874 --> 41:51.319
in an awkward situation.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.049
Like, why can't we do that?

41:53.077 --> 41:55.148
I was working at this club,

41:55.179 --> 41:56.852
and... I walked in the first night.

41:56.881 --> 41:59.555
And I realized at this club,
there was a bathroom attendant.

41:59.583 --> 42:00.823
Have you ever been like,

42:00.851 --> 42:03.559
"Oh, dope, a bathroom
attendant works here".

42:03.587 --> 42:04.827
No, you're like,

42:04.855 --> 42:05.959
"Ah, it's awkward".

42:05.990 --> 42:07.492
They hate you.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.368
You hate... you're just
like, "Oh, please".

42:09.393 --> 42:10.565
Like, you know, it's unnecessary.

42:10.594 --> 42:11.834
Are you ever peeing like,

42:11.862 --> 42:14.138
"How am I gonna leave here
without a Starburst?"

42:16.100 --> 42:17.807
"I don't like going
without somebody listening".

42:17.835 --> 42:19.439
No.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.143
I go in the bathroom the first night,

42:21.171 --> 42:23.947
and the bathroom attendant
stops me at the door.

42:23.974 --> 42:26.181
And she's like,

42:26.210 --> 42:28.656
"They're all full right now,

42:28.679 --> 42:32.024
so you're gonna have to wait a minute".

42:32.049 --> 42:34.529
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah,
I know how bathrooms work".

42:36.086 --> 42:38.191
Like, if she hadn't said that,
I was just gonna go rogue

42:38.222 --> 42:40.498
and start pounding on all the stalls,

42:40.524 --> 42:42.561
up and down with a shiv.

42:42.593 --> 42:44.971
"No!"

42:44.995 --> 42:45.996
Peeing in the sink.

42:46.030 --> 42:49.500
"I do what I want,

42:49.533 --> 42:51.979
bathroom attendant!"

42:54.438 --> 42:56.577
I come out. She hands me a paper towel.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.587
"Thank you.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.714
"If you hadn't saved me,
I would have just bled

43:00.744 --> 43:01.848
"and dripped like stigmata.

43:01.879 --> 43:04.052
Thank you".

43:05.883 --> 43:07.362
So unnecessary.

43:07.384 --> 43:09.386
So, the last night I'm at this club,

43:09.420 --> 43:10.421
I go in the bathroom.

43:10.454 --> 43:11.592
She's, like, facing the wall.

43:11.622 --> 43:12.623
So I'm like, "Oh, good".

43:12.656 --> 43:13.999
I go right in the stall.

43:14.024 --> 43:15.833
And I'm not gonna say anything gross.

43:15.859 --> 43:19.363
But I'm in there just
dropping a ton of heat,

43:19.396 --> 43:21.842
Just...

43:21.865 --> 43:23.173
massacring this bowl.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.271
Just...

43:28.405 --> 43:29.782
I'm texting people, like,

43:29.807 --> 43:30.911
"Am I dying?"

43:33.043 --> 43:34.454
It's like, "Your sister's a nurse".

43:34.478 --> 43:38.119
Things like that.

43:38.148 --> 43:41.425
To a lot of my family,
I just wrote, "Good-bye".

43:44.822 --> 43:47.496
Like, whatever you're picturing,
like, triple it.

43:50.327 --> 43:52.432
I'm sorry. None of that happened.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.999
You guys, none of that happened.

43:54.031 --> 43:56.238
You two, you two, none of that happened.

43:56.266 --> 43:58.644
Hey, did you know there's a show?

44:02.072 --> 44:05.315
Come on, you're pretty.
Just stop talking.

44:05.342 --> 44:08.255
No, I appreciate you
supporting live comedy.

44:08.278 --> 44:11.191
No, none of that happened.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.387
I didn't really...

44:12.416 --> 44:14.828
you guys... oh, my God,
you guys, then just...

44:14.852 --> 44:16.092
what's go... what are
you guys talking about?

44:16.120 --> 44:17.121
What's happening?

44:17.154 --> 44:18.531
Oh, you love me? It's...

44:18.555 --> 44:20.535
It's their anniversary.

44:20.557 --> 44:22.298
Oh, my God, do you remember
that I don't care?

44:22.326 --> 44:23.771
No, I'm just kidding.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.501
No, that's exciting.

44:28.132 --> 44:29.839
How many years?

44:29.867 --> 44:33.110
I'm just kidding. I don't
care. I don't care.

44:34.238 --> 44:35.581
No, I don't care.

44:35.606 --> 44:36.744
No, do you guys care?

44:36.774 --> 44:37.912
No? Okay, sorry.

44:37.941 --> 44:39.249
Sorry, nobody cares.

44:39.276 --> 44:41.756
Nobody cares.

44:41.779 --> 44:43.690
No, but seriously, thank you
guys so much for coming.

44:43.714 --> 44:44.715
Nobody cares.

44:47.117 --> 44:48.323
What's your name?

44:48.352 --> 44:49.422
Erin.

44:49.453 --> 44:51.797
That was a test. Nobody cares, Erin.

44:53.590 --> 44:54.864
You guys are so cute. I'm sorry.

44:54.892 --> 44:56.371
Thank you for spending
your anniversary with me.

44:56.393 --> 44:57.701
Mom, thank you.

44:57.728 --> 44:59.207
I'm sorry you have to sit
next to your daughter

44:59.229 --> 45:02.142
when I'm talking
about semen the whole time.

45:02.166 --> 45:06.478
Where do you stand on ass play, Mom?

45:06.503 --> 45:07.573
You're good?

45:07.604 --> 45:09.845
Okay, you don't want her to
know, but you can't get enough?

45:09.873 --> 45:11.546
Okay.

45:13.644 --> 45:16.716
You guys won't forget this anniversary.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.522
What am I... what am I talking about?

45:22.553 --> 45:23.691
Like, what was I talking about

45:23.721 --> 45:24.791
before I just talked to you guys?

45:24.822 --> 45:26.199
Does anybody remember? Shitting.

45:32.129 --> 45:34.109
I love you guys.

45:34.131 --> 45:35.667
I fucking love this crowd.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.281
The sweetest voice too.

45:42.306 --> 45:44.308
"Shitting".

45:45.909 --> 45:47.752
Oh, God, I wish that happened.

45:47.778 --> 45:49.724
Like, I wish I was
able to... to do that.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.624
But I did, I just...

45:51.648 --> 45:52.956
she was facing the wall,

45:52.983 --> 45:55.224
and I'm like... I hear
that she's crying,

45:55.252 --> 45:56.663
so I'm like,

45:56.687 --> 46:00.362
"Excuse me. I'm about
to wash my hands, so you...

46:00.390 --> 46:01.596
"you better get fucking ready."

46:07.631 --> 46:08.974
No, she's crying.

46:08.999 --> 46:10.205
No, I was like, "Well, what's wrong?

46:10.234 --> 46:11.406
"Like, is it your choices?

46:11.435 --> 46:13.540
Like, what's..."

46:15.839 --> 46:17.750
No, I asked her what was
wrong, and she was like...

46:17.775 --> 46:19.652
she told me, she
was like, "My dog died".

46:19.676 --> 46:21.713
So I was like, "I'm so
sorry. I've been there.

46:21.745 --> 46:23.019
"I'm gonna go get us some shots.

46:23.046 --> 46:24.525
"We're gonna get weird
in here tonight, okay?

46:24.548 --> 46:26.391
You and me".

46:26.416 --> 46:28.657
And she goes, "it
just really doesn't feel

46:28.685 --> 46:31.063
like six years ago".

46:33.557 --> 46:34.695
What do you say?

46:34.725 --> 46:35.965
I just looked right at her and just...

46:39.696 --> 46:40.834
What do you do?

46:40.864 --> 46:42.002
I found the owner, I was like,

46:42.032 --> 46:43.773
"She's doing a ton of blow in there.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.281
You should get rid of her".

46:50.340 --> 46:52.183
I...

46:52.209 --> 46:53.813
I've been really enjoying
being on the road

46:53.844 --> 46:56.791
ever since the roast, because
I've been on the road, like,

46:56.814 --> 46:59.090
for years, but...

46:59.116 --> 47:00.652
but people had no idea who I was,

47:00.684 --> 47:02.288
so they would see a picture
of me, and they'd be like,

47:02.319 --> 47:03.457
"Oh, she looks sweet.

47:03.487 --> 47:06.263
"She kind of looks, like,
Amish, you know?

47:06.290 --> 47:10.568
"Like... kind of
Cabbage Patchy up top, right?

47:10.594 --> 47:11.937
"We should bring the family.

47:11.962 --> 47:13.305
I bet she talks about, like, shopping".

47:13.330 --> 47:15.776
And then they get here,
and I'm like, "My pussy..."

47:21.772 --> 47:23.012
but it's way better now,

47:23.040 --> 47:24.451
'cause, like, a lot
of people saw that roast,

47:24.474 --> 47:26.454
and they just are like,
"Oh, she's, like, a bad person".

47:26.476 --> 47:28.717
So that means you guys are dirtbags too,

47:28.745 --> 47:31.589
and I appreciate you coming out.

47:31.615 --> 47:33.151
You are bad people.

47:36.753 --> 47:40.223
Thank you, bad people.

47:40.257 --> 47:41.600
But I've been really lucky.

47:41.625 --> 47:44.572
Like, my whole life, I found
friends just like me.

47:44.595 --> 47:46.597
Like, at a young age, I found
girls that were just like me.

47:46.630 --> 47:48.166
Like, we were all whores.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.233
You know?

47:49.266 --> 47:51.769
Just little drunks running around.

47:51.802 --> 47:53.839
But in every group of girlfriends,

47:53.871 --> 47:56.545
there's always, like, one
that's the sluttiest, you know?

47:56.573 --> 47:58.985
If you don't have that friend,
you're that friend.

47:59.009 --> 48:01.011
Let's be real.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.359
And it wasn't me in my group of friends.

48:04.381 --> 48:06.327
Shocker was my nickname.

48:13.023 --> 48:14.696
But, no, in my group
of friends... in my...

48:14.725 --> 48:16.534
the sluttiest of us was this girl Katie.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.335
And... we didn't judge her for that.

48:18.362 --> 48:19.932
But she... she wouldn't own it.

48:19.963 --> 48:22.068
Like as soon as she
would have a boyfriend,

48:22.099 --> 48:24.545
she'd start acting like Mother
Teresa, you know?

48:24.568 --> 48:25.774
She'd, like, walk different.

48:25.802 --> 48:27.213
She talked differently.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.238
Like, I remember one time

48:28.272 --> 48:29.444
she walked over with her new boyfriend,

48:29.473 --> 48:30.508
she was like,

48:30.540 --> 48:34.647
"Adam and I are thrilled
you could join us for brunch".

48:34.678 --> 48:37.659
I was like, "I've helped you
get cum out of your hair".

48:42.953 --> 48:44.591
"Remember, we tried using peanut butter

48:44.621 --> 48:46.123
'cause we're stupid, remember?"

48:49.293 --> 48:53.571
We didn't talk about that
at brunch with Adam.

48:53.597 --> 48:58.205
So she moved to Connecticut
and, like, was getting married,

48:58.235 --> 48:59.646
and she had a wedding shower there.

48:59.670 --> 49:01.581
And I was the only friend
from home that could go.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.381
So I met all of her new,
fancy Connecticut friends.

49:04.408 --> 49:05.751
And, like, you know women like this.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.084
Like, these girls,

49:07.110 --> 49:09.454
they were all, like,
very Stepford wife, you know?

49:09.479 --> 49:11.015
They all, like, wore, like,

49:11.048 --> 49:14.120
pastel cashmere cardigans and pearls

49:14.151 --> 49:16.961
and Burberry, like, tampons.

49:18.989 --> 49:21.799
And they all spoke like this,
like almost in a whisper.

49:21.825 --> 49:23.168
Like, they all were...

49:23.193 --> 49:25.503
everybody just walked around
whispering to each other.

49:25.529 --> 49:27.031
Like, "Oh, I guess we were just born

49:27.064 --> 49:28.839
"with different vocal cords

49:28.865 --> 49:30.173
'cause I was raised better.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.611
Do you ski?"

49:35.372 --> 49:37.249
So I'm at this party,

49:37.274 --> 49:39.117
and I'm, like, mainlining chardonnay,

49:39.142 --> 49:40.883
trying to remember fun.

49:43.180 --> 49:44.955
Just like, "Why?"

49:44.982 --> 49:48.953
So one of the girls was like,
"Let's play a game".

49:48.986 --> 49:52.092
And I'm like,
"Suicide pact? I'll go first.

49:52.122 --> 49:54.625
This party's the worst".

49:54.658 --> 49:56.467
And she goes, "No, let's all go around

49:56.493 --> 49:58.837
and admit something".

49:58.862 --> 50:01.069
And I'm like, "Oh, no".

50:03.633 --> 50:05.044
So these girls are going around.

50:05.068 --> 50:06.877
They are... the shit
they're admitting is so boring.

50:06.903 --> 50:08.541
I can't... like, one girl was like,

50:08.572 --> 50:10.552
"Once, I forgot to let
the dog out all day!"

50:10.574 --> 50:13.111
And they were all like, "No!"

50:15.946 --> 50:19.052
I'm like, "Is this
happening right now?"

50:19.082 --> 50:22.029
So the girl that goes right
before me, Bridget,

50:22.052 --> 50:24.157
the worst human I've ever met.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.393
I hope she sees this.

50:25.422 --> 50:27.732
That's how bad of a person she is.

50:29.026 --> 50:32.098
Like, Bridget, I
hope you're watching this.

50:32.129 --> 50:33.130
But she wouldn't.

50:33.163 --> 50:36.906
She wouldn't be up this late.

50:36.933 --> 50:38.037
She spoke the softest.

50:38.068 --> 50:39.376
You had to, like, lean in and squint

50:39.403 --> 50:40.882
and read her lips, 'cause she just...

50:40.904 --> 50:43.885
Bridget talked like an angel

50:43.907 --> 50:45.682
was sleeping on her tongue.

50:50.414 --> 50:52.587
<i># No one wake the angel</i>

50:52.616 --> 50:55.426
<i># On my tongue</i>

50:55.452 --> 50:56.590
That's not a real song,

50:56.620 --> 50:58.031
Comedy Central.

51:01.625 --> 51:03.127
So, anyway, she's like,

51:03.160 --> 51:04.537
"All right, you guys, it's my turn.

51:04.561 --> 51:06.063
Bring it in".

51:06.096 --> 51:07.632
And we're like, "We're
in 'cause we have to be,

51:07.664 --> 51:09.701
'cause you talk like Fievel".

51:11.535 --> 51:14.311
Use your diaphragm, Bridge.

51:14.337 --> 51:15.338
So she's like,

51:15.372 --> 51:16.749
"I'll admit this.

51:16.773 --> 51:20.220
"Sometimes after Richard falls asleep,

51:20.243 --> 51:22.917
I get up and eat ice cream".

51:24.881 --> 51:27.361
I just wanted to find one
other pair of eyes being like,

51:27.384 --> 51:30.092
"What a dumb cunt, right?"

51:30.120 --> 51:31.929
But nothing. No one.

51:31.955 --> 51:36.233
They're all looking at her like,
"Bridget! You should be asleep".

51:38.562 --> 51:43.102
"Bridget, it's night. Carbs? Come on".

51:45.035 --> 51:46.241
So then it's my turn,

51:46.269 --> 51:48.806
and... I don't look at my friend Katie.

51:48.839 --> 51:51.911
I just feel her just glaring
at me, just like,

51:51.942 --> 51:55.913
"Don't be yourself right now, bitch!

51:55.946 --> 51:58.017
This is my new life".

51:58.048 --> 51:59.288
And so I'm like,

51:59.316 --> 52:02.195
"Okay... first of all, Bridget,

52:02.219 --> 52:04.699
thank you for being so brave".

52:10.660 --> 52:12.571
"I'll admit this.

52:12.596 --> 52:15.736
"It's kind of like your ice cream thing.

52:15.765 --> 52:18.473
"One time

52:18.502 --> 52:22.211
I let a cab driver finger me".

52:38.655 --> 52:39.963
And Katie's like,

52:39.990 --> 52:41.628
"That's not how you play, Amy".

52:41.658 --> 52:43.660
I'm like, "Really?
'Cause I feel like I won.

52:43.693 --> 52:46.401
I feel..." You guys,
you were an amazing crowd.

52:46.429 --> 52:48.272
Thank you so much.

53:20.730 --> 53:24.542
I feel like this is
what I would feel like,

53:24.568 --> 53:27.549
like, if I ever kept a baby.

53:27.571 --> 53:30.347
You know, like, this kind of joy.

53:48.325 --> 53:50.737
Thank you guys so much.

53:55.432 --> 53:57.139
Thank you.

53:57.167 --> 53:59.169
Fuck, thank you.

54:01.905 --> 54:05.682
Oh!

54:05.709 --> 54:08.690
I want to jerk you
all off, even the girls.

54:08.712 --> 54:10.453
Even the girls.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.959
Guys, thank you.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.290
I really, really appreciate it.

54:13.316 --> 54:14.886
I know you guys are thinking like,

54:14.918 --> 54:16.226
"What are you doing back out here?"

54:16.253 --> 54:17.596
And some of you were just thinking like,

54:17.621 --> 54:21.000
"You're so pretty".

54:21.024 --> 54:22.503
Thank all of you.

54:22.525 --> 54:24.562
But I wanted to come out
and just sort of, like,

54:24.594 --> 54:26.904
give you an opportunity if
anybody wants to ask a question,

54:26.930 --> 54:28.341
like, now it's the time.

54:28.365 --> 54:30.311
It doesn't have to be about my set.

54:30.333 --> 54:31.505
Yeah? What's your name?

54:31.534 --> 54:33.241
And what... what actor are you?

54:35.772 --> 54:37.149
I'm Cubed.

54:37.173 --> 54:38.174
What?

54:38.208 --> 54:39.482
My name's Cubed.

54:39.509 --> 54:41.216
Cubed?

54:41.244 --> 54:43.383
Does anybody different have a question?

54:44.481 --> 54:45.983
With a name that makes sense?

54:46.016 --> 54:48.121
No, I'm just kidding.
What... what happened?

54:48.151 --> 54:49.824
Where... where are your parents from?

54:49.853 --> 54:50.957
What are you doing later?

54:50.987 --> 54:51.988
What am I doing later?

54:52.022 --> 54:53.092
Ooh, Cubed.

54:53.123 --> 54:55.034
Do you have HPV? Do you want it?

54:59.696 --> 55:02.802
I haven't drank in two months,
getting ready for this.

55:02.832 --> 55:05.642
So I'm gonna, like, black out.

55:05.669 --> 55:07.671
If anybody wants to get down with me,

55:07.704 --> 55:09.274
like, sexually,

55:09.306 --> 55:12.344
tonight is not the night.

55:12.375 --> 55:14.446
But, yes, I'm gonna tie one on.

55:14.477 --> 55:17.924
Anybody... yes, you,
sir. What's your name?

55:17.947 --> 55:19.392
- Rick.
- Hi, Rick.

55:19.416 --> 55:21.293
I want to give you a standing

55:21.318 --> 55:23.764
I think we all should
give you a standing ovation.

55:26.089 --> 55:28.660
This guy's sad 'cause he's wasted.

55:28.692 --> 55:31.798
You don't have to... thank you.

55:31.828 --> 55:35.105
This is good for the camera.

55:37.934 --> 55:39.436
Wow.

55:39.469 --> 55:41.142
Thank you.

55:43.807 --> 55:45.718
Okay, okay. Thank you.

55:45.742 --> 55:47.551
That was... that was nice.

55:47.577 --> 55:48.885
A lot of people weren't into it.

55:48.912 --> 55:51.119
Like, a lot of people got up
and were just kind of, like...

55:52.315 --> 55:54.795
"Our reservations were,
like, ten minutes ago.

55:54.818 --> 55:56.525
When's this bitch gonna wrap it up?"

55:56.553 --> 55:59.090
Yes, you, gorgeous. Hi.

55:59.122 --> 56:00.396
Can I buy you a drink,

56:00.423 --> 56:03.233
possibly have a cocktail
with you at some point?

56:03.259 --> 56:04.260
Ooh, this is awesome.

56:04.294 --> 56:05.739
You can definitely buy me a drink.

56:05.762 --> 56:07.400
I don't... I'm not gay.

56:07.430 --> 56:09.535
I mean, I've caught a
finger. I'm not boring.

56:09.566 --> 56:11.568
Trust me.

56:11.601 --> 56:13.603
But, yeah, I could totally
see that happening.

56:13.636 --> 56:15.445
I don't think that
would be weird at all.

56:15.472 --> 56:17.008
Your boyfriend doesn't seem too psyched,

56:17.040 --> 56:20.021
but he's all fired up about Pride.

56:20.043 --> 56:21.716
Oh, yes, you. Hi.

56:21.745 --> 56:26.091
So... who is your comedy mentor?

56:26.116 --> 56:27.459
My comedy mentor.

56:27.484 --> 56:29.259
That's a good question.

56:29.285 --> 56:32.357
I hang out with
mostly 45-year-old dudes.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.925
Thank you.

56:33.957 --> 56:35.698
They're all comedians.
They're alcoholics.

56:35.725 --> 56:38.467
Like, they don't drink anymore
'cause they can't, you know?

56:38.495 --> 56:39.530
And it makes sense,

56:39.562 --> 56:41.303
because, like, they look
at me, and they're just like,

56:41.331 --> 56:42.435
"Oh, my God".

56:42.465 --> 56:45.412
Like, they think I'm so hot
just 'cause I'm not their wives.

56:46.536 --> 56:47.606
I walk in, they're like...

56:47.637 --> 56:49.310
<i># Who's that girl? #</i>

56:49.339 --> 56:50.477
I'm like, "What?"

56:50.507 --> 56:52.509
But out, like, you know, in the streets,

56:52.542 --> 56:54.283
people are just throwing
lit cigarettes at me.

56:54.310 --> 56:56.620
They're like, "Ugh, pass".

56:56.646 --> 57:00.150
So, like, Dave Attell and Jim Norton.

57:01.317 --> 57:03.456
Right?

57:04.587 --> 57:06.362
And so... yeah, you
gotta love those guys.

57:06.389 --> 57:07.959
Yeah... yes.

57:07.991 --> 57:09.561
- Of women...
- Women.

57:09.592 --> 57:11.868
- Comics, who is your mentor?
- Okay.

57:11.895 --> 57:15.365
Okay, well, Jessica
Kirson was my mentor.

57:15.398 --> 57:17.207
Like, she's in New York,
and she's amazing.

57:17.233 --> 57:19.179
And then... sort of where she left off,

57:19.202 --> 57:21.739
I just like... my mentor, like,
those guys took me on the road

57:21.771 --> 57:23.773
to open for them a lot, so that's why.

57:23.807 --> 57:25.650
But I grew up loving Gilda

57:25.675 --> 57:27.586
and Goldie Hawn,

57:27.610 --> 57:30.523
and I love Margaret Cho,
and Sarah... Palin.

57:30.547 --> 57:31.719
I'm just kidding.

57:34.317 --> 57:35.819
You, sir.

57:35.852 --> 57:37.331
What's your feeling on anal bleaching?

57:37.353 --> 57:38.388
Anal bleaching.

57:38.421 --> 57:40.492
I'm glad somebody brought this up.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.767
That's a great question.

57:43.793 --> 57:45.864
Okay, so here's how I feel about it.

57:45.895 --> 57:47.101
When I heard about it, I was just like,

57:47.130 --> 57:49.041
"Ew, everybody, chill out".

57:49.065 --> 57:50.635
But then I looked at my own asshole,

57:50.667 --> 57:53.739
and I was like, "Whoa!

57:53.770 --> 57:55.477
"That looks like something
out of the universe.

57:55.505 --> 57:56.643
Maybe we should hook that up".

57:56.673 --> 57:58.380
But I still haven't done anything.

57:58.408 --> 58:01.412
But I keep a low pro, butt-wise.

58:01.444 --> 58:03.151
You... I'm doing God's work.

58:03.179 --> 58:04.920
I mean, am I healing people? Yes?

58:04.948 --> 58:06.655
What's your favorite city?

58:06.683 --> 58:07.923
My favorite city?

58:07.951 --> 58:09.259
New York City...

58:09.285 --> 58:12.061
Yeah...

58:12.088 --> 58:16.059
Sorry, one girl's like, "Boo".

58:16.092 --> 58:18.902
I like Madison, Wisconsin.

58:20.563 --> 58:21.598
Nice.

58:21.631 --> 58:23.633
And I think Cleveland's the worst.

58:27.036 --> 58:29.983
Yes, you, sir?

58:30.006 --> 58:31.280
Why is your sister here?

58:31.307 --> 58:33.048
Why is my sister here?

58:33.076 --> 58:35.750
You know what? I have no idea.

58:35.778 --> 58:37.587
I didn't fly her in. She showed up.

58:37.614 --> 58:39.150
She shows up wherever I am.

58:39.182 --> 58:43.756
My sister is here because...

58:43.786 --> 58:45.663
she's my best friend in the whole world,

58:45.688 --> 58:47.998
and I love her and
trust her more than anyone.

58:48.024 --> 58:50.368
And I dedicate this show to her.

58:51.761 --> 58:55.504
And I want to thank my mom,
who's not a cunt at all.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.034
My mom... please clap for my mom.

58:57.066 --> 58:58.409
She's not a cunt.

58:59.636 --> 59:02.310
But her bush was huge
when I was growing up.

59:02.338 --> 59:04.045
That was true.

59:04.073 --> 59:06.576
Okay, yeah?

59:06.609 --> 59:09.146
Do you have to pee as bad as I do?

59:09.178 --> 59:11.124
Oh, okay, she has to pee,
and she's really pretty.

59:11.147 --> 59:12.353
So everyone's, like,

59:12.382 --> 59:13.827
given her whatever
she wants her whole life.

59:19.656 --> 59:20.964
I don't have to pee at all.

59:20.990 --> 59:22.298
It's pretty sweet.

59:22.325 --> 59:25.238
I feel, like, physically,
real comfortable up here.

59:25.261 --> 59:26.740
I could hang out.

59:26.763 --> 59:28.071
If you don't mind,

59:28.097 --> 59:30.373
I'm gonna do my 90-minute
one-woman show now.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.241
Thank you.

59:38.274 --> 59:40.083
Thank you, Comedy Central,

59:40.109 --> 59:41.554
and thank you guys.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.989
Thank you.

59:55.058 --> 59:57.436
Oh, God, Dad died.

59:57.460 --> 59:59.462
When?

59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.907
I guess, like, today.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:07.644
Are you gonna talk about it onstage?

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:08.671
Yeah.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.013
Yeah? You should open with it.
