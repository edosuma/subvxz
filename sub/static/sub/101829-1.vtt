00:52.971 --> 00:55.272
Sweetheart, time
to get up, okay?

01:05.282 --> 01:09.152
Sarah, uh, you
gotta know this, if...

01:09.186 --> 01:11.756
If you're not happy in
New York, if you don't like

01:11.789 --> 01:14.491
New York, you can always
come back here, you can

01:14.524 --> 01:17.996
study theater here, you may even
teach theater here.

01:18.029 --> 01:19.664
Don't jinx her, okay?

01:19.697 --> 01:21.531
Just don't j...
jinx the kid.

01:21.566 --> 01:22.667
It's... She'll do fine.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.835
What are you doing?

01:23.868 --> 01:25.268
I'm... I'm giving
her an alternative.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.005
It's not... I'm not
saying don't do it.

01:27.038 --> 01:29.239
But she knows she
has a house here.

01:29.272 --> 01:31.643
Well, but I wanna tell
her she can always come back

01:31.676 --> 01:33.077
here and it's not
a big deal.

01:33.111 --> 01:34.746
Oh God, just... I... I...
It's not a failure, right?

01:34.779 --> 01:36.014
I... I know.

01:36.047 --> 01:37.715
I and... I mean it's
probably not for me,

01:37.749 --> 01:39.684
but I'll take it one
day at a time, so yeah.

01:39.717 --> 01:40.885
Well, just don't
listen to anybody.

01:40.918 --> 01:43.688
You do your... you
own thing, okay?

01:43.721 --> 01:44.889
Especially, grandma, okay?

01:44.922 --> 01:46.223
Yeah, right, who's
gonna go watch her?

01:46.256 --> 01:47.892
- You?
- Yes.

01:47.925 --> 01:49.326
I will.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.428
Yeah, I bet you will.

01:51.461 --> 01:55.600
- Okay, guys, let's...
- She's always got a home here.

01:55.633 --> 01:56.701
I know that.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.168
We love her and she can
do anything here

01:58.201 --> 02:00.537
That she could do there.

02:00.571 --> 02:01.939
It's a terrible
place, New York.

02:01.973 --> 02:03.306
- You're jinxing her.
- It's very dangerous.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.374
You're jinxing the kid.

02:04.408 --> 02:05.877
- I'm not jinxing...
- Guys, it's okay, it's okay.

02:05.910 --> 02:06.978
It'll be fine, guys.

02:07.011 --> 02:09.714
Oh, it's not a jinx,
I'm just giving her alternative.

02:11.749 --> 02:14.786
She knows she's
got a home here forever.

02:14.819 --> 02:16.486
Why are you
pushing around?

02:16.520 --> 02:17.855
Guys, it's okay.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.123
It's okay, I'm gonna be great.

02:19.157 --> 02:20.591
I promise you,

02:20.625 --> 02:23.293
- I... I will...
- I'm sure you're gonna be just fine.

02:23.326 --> 02:24.896
How's your time, honey?

02:24.929 --> 02:27.297
Well, we're good to go,
we have a couple more minutes.

02:27.330 --> 02:31.069
Okay, baby, you just watch
your step out there.

02:31.102 --> 02:32.670
Watch out for
shady people.

02:32.704 --> 02:35.840
New York is full
of shady people.

02:35.873 --> 02:38.743
You be careful, 'cause
you're a good girl.

02:38.776 --> 02:42.412
Your father was a bum you
know, and your mom

02:42.446 --> 02:45.382
was a very troubled spirit.

02:45.415 --> 02:49.854
But you're not either of
them, you're your own, kid.

02:49.887 --> 02:53.091
And you got me as a grandpa
and the apple does not

02:53.124 --> 02:55.727
fall far from
the tree, okay?

02:55.760 --> 02:56.961
Don't worry, grandpa.

02:56.994 --> 02:58.596
I'm gonna go to New York
and I'm gonna crush it.

02:58.629 --> 03:00.497
You know, I'm gonna conquer it.

03:00.530 --> 03:01.933
Oh.

03:01.966 --> 03:03.400
Just
give me a month, two tops,

03:03.433 --> 03:05.335
- and I'll own the town.
- You'll own the town.

03:05.368 --> 03:06.704
You're a monkey, come on.

03:08.305 --> 03:11.676
You're a wonderful kid, you'll
do fine, okay?

03:11.709 --> 03:15.880
Anything you need, just jump on
the phone, okay?

03:15.913 --> 03:17.148
I love you, grandpa.

03:17.181 --> 03:18.616
Yeah.

03:22.987 --> 03:24.421
But you ain't
got enough money.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.522
I do.

03:25.556 --> 03:27.424
Yeah, I'll be...
I'll be okay.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.391
Oh, give me some.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.089
Your grandfather was one cool
cat when I knew him.

03:58.122 --> 03:59.557
He was?

03:59.590 --> 04:01.559
Of course, he was.

04:01.592 --> 04:03.393
So I'm here to help
in any way I can.

04:03.426 --> 04:06.197
Just let me know if you
need anything, okay?

04:06.230 --> 04:07.799
Thank you, Helena.

04:07.832 --> 04:10.134
You know, the best
criteria for getting

04:10.168 --> 04:12.804
a New York apartment or
not is whether something

04:12.837 --> 04:14.639
moves on the floor
when you walk in.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.140
Ha!

04:16.173 --> 04:19.177
Well, nothing ran on the floor,
so I guess I'm good.

04:28.119 --> 04:30.520
Your first day?

04:30.555 --> 04:32.824
Does it show?

04:32.857 --> 04:35.325
I'm looking
for the financial aid office.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.296
It's right here.

04:38.328 --> 04:39.831
I'm Philip.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.331
- Sarah.
- Come on.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.900
Thanks.

04:50.741 --> 04:52.076
- I know, I know...
- Hmm.

04:52.109 --> 04:53.476
A banana is a
healthier source of

04:53.510 --> 04:55.079
potassium than
potato chips.

04:55.112 --> 04:57.347
Me, I'm hooked on
potato chips and I don't mean

04:57.380 --> 05:00.417
- the organic shit either.
- I hear you.

05:00.450 --> 05:01.652
- I'm Sarah.
- Luna.

05:01.686 --> 05:03.688
My parents smoked
a lot of weed.

05:03.721 --> 05:04.922
This is Josie.

05:04.956 --> 05:07.625
How small a town
are you from anyway?

05:07.658 --> 05:09.660
Does it show that much?

05:09.694 --> 05:11.428
Oh yeah.

05:11.461 --> 05:12.997
Everyone knows everyone.

05:13.030 --> 05:15.032
Everyone knows what
everyone ate for breakfast.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.033
You?

05:16.067 --> 05:16.868
Queens.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.035
Nobody knows nothing.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.070
Jersey City.

05:19.103 --> 05:19.871
Nobody cares.

05:19.904 --> 05:21.906
Like nobody.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.440
- I'm Sarah.
- Jasmine.

05:23.473 --> 05:25.042
Nice to meet
you, new girl.

05:25.076 --> 05:27.211
So do you guys
have any advice?

05:27.245 --> 05:28.312
Any tips?

05:28.346 --> 05:29.847
Regarding?

05:29.881 --> 05:31.349
Living in New York City.

05:31.381 --> 05:33.050
Oh wow!

05:33.084 --> 05:34.785
Oh, this is gonna be good.

05:34.819 --> 05:36.621
Gee, I don't know if I'm
really the person to ask.

05:36.654 --> 05:38.189
She's not the person
to ask.

05:38.222 --> 05:40.358
All I can say is get
used to lots of noise.

05:40.390 --> 05:41.491
And the filth.

05:41.524 --> 05:43.794
And totally
disgusting smells.

05:43.828 --> 05:45.796
Like smells you never
knew could exist.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.765
- And rude behavior...
- Totally rude.

05:47.798 --> 05:48.699
Just be ready for anything.

05:48.733 --> 05:49.967
And everything.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.603
And totally fucking
disgusting smells.

05:52.637 --> 05:54.437
Don't forget
that, I'm serious.

05:54.471 --> 05:56.107
Gotcha.

05:56.140 --> 05:59.277
Um, did I miss anything
important first semester?

05:59.310 --> 06:01.946
Not a fuckin' thing.

06:09.353 --> 06:10.922
Oh!

06:10.955 --> 06:13.391
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

06:13.423 --> 06:16.060
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

06:16.093 --> 06:17.995
You... you're my new
neighbor, right?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.630
Oh, um, I guess.

06:19.664 --> 06:21.299
Uh, I'm Sarah.

06:21.332 --> 06:22.600
Sarah Quintana.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.601
Frankie.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.769
Frankie Li.

06:24.802 --> 06:25.770
It's nice to meet you.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.772
Um, long night?

06:27.805 --> 06:31.309
Long night, long day,
turned to long night.

06:31.342 --> 06:34.845
You keep odd hours, Frankie Li.

06:34.879 --> 06:37.581
Saving life has
no time clock.

06:37.615 --> 06:39.449
I'm in the liquid
therapy business.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.618
I own a bar.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.518
Oh.

06:41.552 --> 06:42.720
Oh, good to know.

06:42.753 --> 06:44.555
Um, guess I'll
see you around.

06:44.588 --> 06:46.390
Yeah, see you around.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.595
I meet nothin'
but neurotics and

06:51.629 --> 06:53.097
head-cases in this city.

06:53.130 --> 06:55.399
So I start this online
dating thing since

06:55.433 --> 06:56.934
my wife flew the coop.

06:56.968 --> 06:58.501
No luck.

06:58.535 --> 06:59.904
But I went out on a date
with this woman,

06:59.937 --> 07:02.239
she was a prison guard
and she had a personality

07:02.273 --> 07:04.608
- to match.
- Hmm.

07:04.642 --> 07:06.277
She's a delicate flower.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.812
No.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.880
This girl kicked both
our asses before breakfast.

07:09.914 --> 07:12.283
I'm talking about Sarah.

07:12.316 --> 07:13.317
Who the hell is Sarah?

07:13.351 --> 07:16.420
The girl that just
moved into my building.

07:16.454 --> 07:17.421
Did you make your move?

07:17.455 --> 07:18.889
What move?

07:18.923 --> 07:20.257
Not yet.

07:20.291 --> 07:21.459
What are you waiting for?

07:21.491 --> 07:23.194
You ain't gettin'
any younger.

07:23.227 --> 07:24.562
Listen, come here,
let me see something.

07:24.595 --> 07:25.963
Open up your mouth.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.198
Ah.

07:27.231 --> 07:29.467
Listen, I can't send you
into battle with dirty teeth

07:29.499 --> 07:31.469
if this girl's
all you said she is.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.636
I gotta clean you up.

08:12.109 --> 08:14.612
Mm.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.848
You need new headshots.

08:17.882 --> 08:20.451

08:20.484 --> 08:22.319
So anyway, where do you see
yourself, Miss Sarah,

08:22.353 --> 08:24.155

08:24.188 --> 08:25.256
Oh, jeez.

08:25.289 --> 08:27.558
Um, five years.

Um, and... yeah, I mean I...
I'd really like to do like

08:48.646 --> 08:50.781

- Look,

08:53.050 --> 08:56.787

agent is I'm realistic.

08:56.821 --> 09:00.091
You come in with these big
dreams, I'm here to stomp

09:00.124 --> 09:03.627
them out, and maybe on
the way, you and I can

09:03.661 --> 09:05.062
make some dough.

09:05.096 --> 09:06.630
You dig?

09:09.800 --> 09:13.572
I think I'm gonna sign
you, not because I like you,

09:13.604 --> 09:15.239
because I think
you and I, we could make

09:15.272 --> 09:17.374
some money together.

09:17.408 --> 09:20.411
And you can learn a
little about the business.

Anyway, you have

09:35.526 --> 09:38.696
Oh, um... I don't know.

Not a dog, my patient.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.649
Glad I don't
have a job that runs

11:04.683 --> 11:06.217
the risk of getting bit.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.218
You don't have a job.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.753
Hey, being unemployed is
a fulltime job, alright?

11:09.787 --> 11:12.089
Yeah, so is finding decent
woman in this town.

11:12.122 --> 11:12.990
Phew.

11:13.023 --> 11:15.826
Kasey, how come
we never went out?

11:15.859 --> 11:17.895
How come you say
my name wrong?

11:17.928 --> 11:18.729
Kasey.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.197
It's not Kasey.

11:20.231 --> 11:21.700
It's K.C.

11:21.732 --> 11:23.234
Like Kansas City.

11:23.267 --> 11:27.404
Okay, K.C., how come
we never went out?

11:27.438 --> 11:30.575
Oh, I just really don't wanna
ruin our friendship, Bob.

11:30.609 --> 11:33.143
Come on, K.C., ruin our
friendship, please!

11:33.177 --> 11:35.913
Bob, take
it down a notch.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.481
- Too desperate?
- Oh yeah.

11:39.984 --> 11:43.655
- Oh, excuse me.
- Uh, you're excused.

11:43.688 --> 11:45.322
Well, hey there, handsome.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.658
Oh, handsome.

11:46.691 --> 11:47.858
Oh, she thinks I'm handsome.

11:47.891 --> 11:49.694
- How are you?
- Good.

11:49.728 --> 11:51.596
Uh, I have an
oral fixation.

11:51.630 --> 11:54.298
Oh.

11:54.331 --> 11:55.432
Pistachios?

11:55.466 --> 11:57.501
I think you should start doin'
some special events

11:57.534 --> 11:59.069
- in your bar.
- Like what?

11:59.103 --> 12:01.138
You know, buy one, get two
free, somethin' like that.

12:01.171 --> 12:03.575
- Like you guys been getting.
- How about this?

12:03.608 --> 12:05.276
- Get two and get four free?
- How about this?

12:05.309 --> 12:06.410
What?

12:06.443 --> 12:10.514
You spend $100, $20 for
a cleaning at my dentist place.

12:12.182 --> 12:14.818
What's a classy guy like you
doin' in a dump like this?

12:14.852 --> 12:18.623
Oh, we like this
dump um, joint.

12:18.657 --> 12:19.957
Place.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.728
What are you drinkin', miss?

12:24.663 --> 12:26.397
- Ooh!
- Phew!

12:26.430 --> 12:28.899
Let me think.

12:28.932 --> 12:31.770
God, there is just
so many choices.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.505
Right.

12:35.573 --> 12:38.275
You guys just let me
know when you're ready.

12:39.577 --> 12:42.413
What do you
recommend, big boy?

12:42.446 --> 12:45.249
Um, I don't know.

12:45.282 --> 12:49.219
What do... what do you...
what do you like to drink?

12:49.253 --> 12:52.189
Hmm, something sweet.

12:52.222 --> 12:53.390
Like you.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.526
S... s... sweet?

12:55.560 --> 12:58.697
She... she
thinks I'm sweet.

12:58.730 --> 13:02.567
People spend $100 on alcohol,
they come to my office,

13:02.600 --> 13:05.369
get a free cleaning,
but they have to

13:05.402 --> 13:07.104
be beautiful women.

13:09.973 --> 13:11.508
You uh, lookin'
for someone?

13:11.542 --> 13:13.077
Yeah, the... the chick
that was just here.

13:13.110 --> 13:14.511
- The blonde with the tits.
- Oh, yeah?

13:14.545 --> 13:15.814
Yeah, really?

13:15.846 --> 13:18.048
- You mean my wife?
- Yeah, the... no...

13:18.082 --> 13:19.350
No.

13:19.383 --> 13:21.385
- Hey, you done with class for the day?
- Yep.

13:21.418 --> 13:22.554
Cool.

13:22.587 --> 13:23.655
Let's hang.

13:23.688 --> 13:26.558
- Oh, I can't...
- Uh, Homburg at 6:00.

13:26.591 --> 13:29.193
What?

13:29.226 --> 13:30.562
Barry Homburg.

13:30.595 --> 13:31.929
His classes are
the psychological

13:31.962 --> 13:34.932
equivalent of undergoing
a Nazi medical experiment.

13:34.965 --> 13:36.500
Whoa.

13:36.533 --> 13:39.136
Anyway, can we hang
or what?

13:39.169 --> 13:40.404
I can't.

13:40.437 --> 13:41.840
I actually have a meeting
with a manager.

13:41.872 --> 13:43.073
Awesome.

13:43.107 --> 13:44.108
Who's the manager?

13:44.141 --> 13:46.143
Um, have you heard
of Alessandra Berry?

13:46.176 --> 13:47.478
No.

13:47.511 --> 13:48.479
What's the difference
between an agent

13:48.512 --> 13:50.314
and a manager, anyway?

13:50.347 --> 13:52.784
- 5%.
- Okay.

13:52.817 --> 13:54.753
You have a real
commercial look.

13:54.786 --> 13:56.788
You mean, like
for commercials?

13:56.821 --> 13:59.323
Commercials, pilots,
features, web series.

14:00.491 --> 14:03.327
So where is your
office located?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.662
Right here.

14:04.696 --> 14:05.730
In this building?

14:05.764 --> 14:07.197
In this restaurant.

14:07.231 --> 14:08.833
Wherever I happen to
be, that's my office.

14:08.867 --> 14:09.701
I see.

14:09.734 --> 14:10.968
Ladies, how is everything?

14:11.001 --> 14:12.604
Just fine.

14:12.637 --> 14:14.672
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, but you could leave.

14:14.706 --> 14:15.707
Uh.

14:15.740 --> 14:18.710
- Sure.
- Good.

14:21.679 --> 14:23.681
Um, so uh...

14:23.715 --> 14:26.316
uh, how long have you
been a manager for?

14:26.350 --> 14:27.384
Two months.

14:27.418 --> 14:30.521
I used to be an assistant
for Roger Savage.

14:30.555 --> 14:32.256
Roger Savage.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.457
Oh, you know him?

14:33.490 --> 14:35.092
I've heard of him.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.394
Yeah, he sleeps in his office
and he's really fucked up.

14:37.428 --> 14:39.997
Uh, what's your
last name, again?

14:40.030 --> 14:41.231
Um, Quintana.

14:41.265 --> 14:43.300
Oh, that's so
fucking perfect.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.636
Wait, really?

14:44.669 --> 14:46.303
You don't think
it's too ethnic?

14:46.336 --> 14:47.938
Ethnicity is in.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.373
Diversity, kid.

14:49.406 --> 14:52.009
- So I shouldn't change my name?
- No.

14:52.042 --> 14:53.912
It's never been more
advantageous in this

14:53.944 --> 14:56.915
business to be anything other
than a white man.

14:59.416 --> 15:02.052
They don't... they don't show you
movies here, do they?

15:02.085 --> 15:03.688
I wish.

15:03.721 --> 15:08.693
Well, it's up to you,
you're on your own.

15:08.726 --> 15:11.896
You absolutely must
know vintage cinema.

15:11.930 --> 15:13.832
Like old movies?

15:13.865 --> 15:16.901
Like our cinematic legacy.

15:16.935 --> 15:20.404
If you haven't seen Tay
Garnett's <i>One Way Passage</i>

15:20.437 --> 15:22.072
from 1932.

15:22.105 --> 15:24.909
It's not an old movie,
it's a new movie.

15:24.943 --> 15:27.211
Why did you want to
be an actor, anyway?

15:27.244 --> 15:29.179
It's all I've ever done.

15:29.213 --> 15:30.648
It's all I wanted to do.

15:30.682 --> 15:32.549
It's all I can do.

15:32.584 --> 15:35.152
What's the most important thing
about acting?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.220
An agent.

15:36.253 --> 15:37.589
Obviously.

15:40.090 --> 15:43.260
You gotta know the work
of Spencer Tracy, Bette Davis,

15:43.293 --> 15:48.165
Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara,
Edward G. Robinson.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.903
How many of you have
heard of John Cassavetes?

15:51.936 --> 15:55.105
How about Wild
Bill Wellman?

15:55.138 --> 15:57.842
Who?

15:57.876 --> 15:59.443
What movies have you
made, Mr. Cavallo?

15:59.476 --> 16:01.579
Look it up on IMDB.

16:01.613 --> 16:04.716
I'm not gonna give
you my résumé.

16:04.749 --> 16:08.385
And remember, the best directors
are total film geeks.

16:08.418 --> 16:10.220
If you can, you can score
major points with

16:10.254 --> 16:12.422
them if you talk cinema
classics.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.157
That's awesome advice.

16:14.191 --> 16:18.161
It's not awesome advice,
it's the fuckin' lexicon.

16:19.831 --> 16:22.000
Blondie, what are you
practicing to be?

16:22.032 --> 16:23.835
The next Marilyn Monroe?

16:23.868 --> 16:27.471
Uh, actually, Mr.Cavallo,
my name is Piper.

16:27.504 --> 16:28.873
So what about TV?

16:28.907 --> 16:31.275
Oh, the poor man's cinema!

16:31.308 --> 16:33.878
I hope they pick
up your pilot.

16:33.912 --> 16:35.647
In film acting,
you get to underplay

16:35.680 --> 16:37.247
naturalistic acting.

16:37.281 --> 16:38.616
I want to be on Broadway.

16:38.650 --> 16:40.150
Oh yeah?

16:40.183 --> 16:43.453
What time do
you wanna leave?

16:43.487 --> 16:46.958
It's all in the diaphragm.

16:49.293 --> 16:51.128
Ariel's Song
from The Tempest.

16:51.161 --> 16:52.095
"Hark, hark!

16:52.129 --> 16:53.163
Bow-wow.

16:53.196 --> 16:54.197
The watchdogs bark.

16:54.231 --> 16:55.232
Bow-wow.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.534
Hark, hark!"

16:57.569 --> 16:59.771
Alliteration, Jasmine.

16:59.804 --> 17:02.339
Peter Piper's
Practical Principles of

17:02.372 --> 17:05.944
Plain and Perfect
Pronunciation.

17:05.977 --> 17:09.479
"Peter Piper picked a
peck of pickled peppers.

17:09.512 --> 17:12.249
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked."

17:12.281 --> 17:14.384
Oh, together!

17:14.417 --> 17:17.689

- "If Peter Piper picked a peck

17:17.722 --> 17:19.455

- "Of his bones are coral made.
- "Pickled peppers

17:24.796 --> 17:26.763

17:29.199 --> 17:31.468
- "If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."
- "But doth suffer

17:31.501 --> 17:32.502
a sea-change."

17:32.536 --> 17:33.738
"Of something
rich and strange."

17:33.771 --> 17:35.439
"Picked,
pickled peppers Peter Piper picked."

17:35.472 --> 17:37.240
"Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell."
- "A Peck of pickled peppers."

17:37.274 --> 17:38.910
"Ding-dong, Hark!"

17:38.943 --> 17:41.345

17:41.378 --> 17:42.880

17:48.853 --> 17:49.854
"Pickled peppers...

17:50.855 --> 17:53.858
Jeanne,
stop finger trolling.

17:53.891 --> 17:55.927
Josie, continue.

17:59.797 --> 18:02.265
If I never find the right
someone,

18:02.299 --> 18:06.104
if I end up all alone,
if I never find the person

18:06.169 --> 18:08.706
to have the sweetness and the
pain of life with,

18:08.740 --> 18:10.140
if I never have children to take
care of me

18:10.173 --> 18:14.012
when I'm older then...
Then I'll end up all alone,

18:14.045 --> 18:16.446
by myself,
I don't want that.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.582
Who wants that?

18:17.615 --> 18:19.083
You think I do?

18:19.117 --> 18:20.084
You do?

18:20.118 --> 18:23.186
I want a real
live flesh and blood

18:23.220 --> 18:26.124
soul mate, goddammit!

18:26.156 --> 18:28.559
I just know I'll
never have it.

18:28.593 --> 18:30.527
I just know it.

18:30.561 --> 18:32.396
I mean let's
fucking face it,

18:32.429 --> 18:36.868
I'm on the lonely
road to nowhere.

18:36.901 --> 18:37.969
Very good, Josie.

18:38.002 --> 18:39.671
Thank you.

18:39.704 --> 18:42.640
Natural, real, present.

18:42.674 --> 18:44.474
Thank you, Miss Mashmeyer.

18:44.508 --> 18:46.343
Oh, Miz, if you please.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.278
I'm no longer an
ingénue, Although,

18:48.311 --> 18:50.048
I'm often mistaken for one.

18:50.081 --> 18:52.083
Yez, Miz Mashmeyer.

18:52.116 --> 18:54.819
Cute.

18:54.852 --> 18:58.956
Sarah, let's hope this
week is better than last.

18:59.924 --> 19:01.159
Fuck me.

19:01.191 --> 19:05.596
Walk with presence,
with a sense of self.

19:05.630 --> 19:08.465
Stand up uh,
stand up straight.

19:08.498 --> 19:11.501
What is it
that you're hiding?

19:11.535 --> 19:13.871
D... do you all
see this, class?

19:13.905 --> 19:16.741
We can learn from
her ineptitude.

19:16.774 --> 19:18.943
I mean do you even
wanna be an actor?

19:18.976 --> 19:20.144
Why are you here?

19:20.178 --> 19:21.411
Of course I wanna
be an actor.

19:21.445 --> 19:23.513
Do you see how she pauses?

19:23.547 --> 19:27.618
It's because she
is not clear.

19:27.652 --> 19:30.520
Can I please sit
down, Miz Mashmeyer?

19:32.023 --> 19:35.225
No.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.327
Aw, are you crying?

19:37.360 --> 19:38.663
- Why are you crying?
- I'm not crying.

19:38.696 --> 19:40.832
Is it because you're
a little girl?

19:40.865 --> 19:43.034
Woman up, Sarah.

19:43.067 --> 19:46.436
Grow a pair and stop being
such a pathetic girl

19:46.470 --> 19:47.805
who's all about her looks.

19:47.839 --> 19:50.373
God, your weakness is
just embarrassing

19:50.407 --> 19:52.342
to all of us!

19:54.946 --> 19:56.546
It's a good thing it's also
a very good lesson

19:56.581 --> 19:59.016
for the rest of the class.

20:00.952 --> 20:03.988
Can I please sit
down, Miz Mashmeyer?

20:04.021 --> 20:04.956
Oh, oh, I don't know.

20:04.989 --> 20:06.657
Can you?

20:12.029 --> 20:14.431
Class, acting is raw.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.334
It is real, it
is visceral.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.070
When Meryl Streep was
still in class,

20:19.103 --> 20:22.039
she walked out amongst
her peers, took center stage,

20:22.073 --> 20:25.342
ripped up her skirt, and took
a giant steaming dump.

20:25.375 --> 20:30.447
Now that... That is acting.

20:32.950 --> 20:33.918
Class dismissed.

20:33.951 --> 20:36.453
Hey, how do you afford
a place in the Village?

20:36.486 --> 20:38.522
Every struggling actor
I know lives in either

20:38.556 --> 20:40.658
Bed-Stuy, Bushwick,
Greenpoint,

20:40.691 --> 20:44.595
Washington Heights, Jersey
City, maybe Actoria.

20:44.629 --> 20:45.997
What's Actoria?

20:46.030 --> 20:48.032
Astoria to most people.

20:48.065 --> 20:52.536
Oh, um, the landlord is an
old friend of my grandpa,

20:52.570 --> 20:54.705
so she's giving me
a huge break on rent.

20:54.739 --> 20:56.674
Hmm.

20:57.809 --> 21:00.443
I'm thinking
about leaving.

21:00.477 --> 21:01.979
Leaving?

21:02.013 --> 21:04.749
Leaving New York
and going back home.

21:04.782 --> 21:07.417
Said every wannabe
who ever came here.

21:07.450 --> 21:09.620
Ended up 30 pounds
overweight with

21:09.654 --> 21:12.857
a red pickup truck parked
out front, a recycling bin

21:12.890 --> 21:16.160
filled with empty cans of
Coors Light, three rugrats

21:16.194 --> 21:19.764
runnin' around and another
one on the way, in a town

21:19.797 --> 21:22.600
where everyone knows everyone
and everyone's business.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.101
You should write prose.

21:24.135 --> 21:25.570
Sarah, this just in.

21:25.603 --> 21:27.470
Life is a motherfucker.

21:27.504 --> 21:31.108
Life in Manhattan
is a motherfucker on steroids.

21:31.142 --> 21:33.611
Tryin' to make it in show
business is a motherfucker

21:33.644 --> 21:36.113
on steroids
multiplied by 2.

21:36.147 --> 21:37.514
No, by... by 10.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.184
So let me get this straight.

21:40.218 --> 21:41.484
I'm dealing with, what?

21:41.518 --> 21:44.722
Four motherfuckers, three of
which are on steroids?

21:44.755 --> 21:47.424
You can't quit yet.

21:47.457 --> 21:49.227
I won't let you.

21:49.260 --> 21:52.362
You need to stick around, see
how it all ends, right?

21:52.395 --> 21:54.431
I mean, all you
need is one break.

21:54.464 --> 21:56.801
I know just...
Even with the break

21:56.834 --> 21:59.502
I'm getting on rent,
it's just so expensive.

21:59.536 --> 22:02.405
Mm-mm, true.

22:02.439 --> 22:04.242
So how do you manage?

22:04.275 --> 22:05.508
Daddy's rich.

22:05.542 --> 22:07.879
Oh, that helps.

22:10.848 --> 22:14.919
You... you really wanna make
some extra cash?

22:14.952 --> 22:16.988
I might have an idea.

22:17.021 --> 22:18.856
Of course.

22:18.890 --> 22:22.226
This might involve a little...
how do I put this?

22:22.260 --> 22:24.629
Under-the-radar activity.

22:44.615 --> 22:46.918
Were you followed?

22:46.951 --> 22:48.853
Um, followed by whom?

22:48.886 --> 22:50.655
Exactly.

22:53.624 --> 22:54.992
Come in.

22:57.695 --> 23:01.299
Um, I can't
stay very long.

23:01.332 --> 23:03.167
What, you gotta
catch your bus?

23:03.200 --> 23:05.069
Huh?

23:05.102 --> 23:07.338
I'm Mr. Danny.

23:07.371 --> 23:09.073
I'm Sarah.

23:09.106 --> 23:10.374
Sar... Please,
no last names.

23:10.408 --> 23:12.043
Sit down.

23:14.345 --> 23:16.814
Do you know why
you're here?

23:16.847 --> 23:18.049
Not sure.

23:18.082 --> 23:19.750
Good.

23:19.784 --> 23:22.820
How are you with
names and faces?

23:22.853 --> 23:24.454
Um, I don't know.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.756
Even better.

23:25.790 --> 23:27.457
Look, I need you to
run a little errand.

23:27.490 --> 23:30.127
No big deal.

23:30.161 --> 23:31.963
I'll give you
three C notes.

23:40.371 --> 23:42.173
You look a little
disappointed.

23:42.206 --> 23:43.774
Is that your way
of negotiating?

23:43.808 --> 23:46.844
Oh, no, I... I don't...
don't exactly...

23:46.877 --> 23:49.046
Okay.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.781
And here's another C note.

23:53.150 --> 23:55.019
Take it.

23:58.389 --> 24:00.257
Thanks.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.093
Now, let me cut
to the chase.

24:02.126 --> 24:04.562
I want...

24:04.595 --> 24:07.298
Now, that's Mr. Tommy.

24:07.331 --> 24:09.066
Hey.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.901
What do you hear,
what do you say?

24:10.935 --> 24:13.070
Hi.

24:13.104 --> 24:15.606
Don't mind
him, he's good people.

24:15.639 --> 24:18.309
Now, I want you to pick
up a piece of luggage for me

24:18.342 --> 24:19.910
and bring it back here.

24:19.944 --> 24:22.179
Can you do that?

24:22.213 --> 24:23.748
Yeah, sure, I guess.

24:23.781 --> 24:26.283
Um, is there a specific piece
or style

24:26.317 --> 24:27.385
that you want?

24:27.418 --> 24:29.387
Yes, there is.

24:33.324 --> 24:35.426
This key.

24:38.262 --> 24:39.797
Yes.

24:39.830 --> 24:42.400
Hey, kid.

24:42.433 --> 24:43.768
Be a good kid.

24:43.801 --> 24:46.103
Bring me back a piece
of cheesecake.

24:49.473 --> 24:52.343
Okay, seriously,
what did you get me into?

24:52.376 --> 24:54.478
I go to this disgusting
apartment and

24:54.512 --> 24:56.514
there's these two
creepy old guys there.

24:56.546 --> 24:58.082
Where are you now?

24:58.115 --> 25:01.118
They gave me some key to
pick up a piece of luggage

25:01.152 --> 25:02.119
at a locker.

25:02.153 --> 25:03.254
Let me guess.

25:03.287 --> 25:04.655
The bus station?

25:04.688 --> 25:06.290
<i>No, a bowling alley.</i>

25:06.323 --> 25:07.591
Hey.

25:13.564 --> 25:15.266
Aren't you gonna ask
me if I was followed?

25:15.299 --> 25:16.333
Followed by who?

25:16.367 --> 25:17.835
Whom.

25:17.868 --> 25:18.936
Yeah, whom.

25:18.969 --> 25:21.205
Whom on the range,
where the deers and the

25:21.238 --> 25:23.374
antelopes play.

25:23.407 --> 25:25.576
I see you made
it back in record time.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.978
Probably ran all way after you
shit your pants, am I right?

25:28.012 --> 25:29.547
Not entirely true.

25:29.580 --> 25:32.149
And you forgot
my cheesecake.

25:32.183 --> 25:33.417
I'm sorry.

25:33.451 --> 25:34.752
Good work.

25:34.785 --> 25:36.887
Yah, let's not gloss over
this cheesecake thing

25:36.921 --> 25:38.789
or lack of thereof.

25:38.823 --> 25:39.757
I have to go.

25:39.790 --> 25:41.659
Don't you wanna know
what's in the bag?

25:41.692 --> 25:43.594
Come on, you
must be curious.

25:43.627 --> 25:46.097
Uh, I think I should leave.

25:49.767 --> 25:51.469
Bada bang.

25:51.502 --> 25:53.304
Cute, ain't it?

25:53.337 --> 25:55.673
Wait, is that
filled with heroin?

25:55.706 --> 25:57.975
Like... like in that movie
with Audrey Hepburn?

25:58.008 --> 26:00.111
Movie?

26:00.144 --> 26:02.446
She's talkin' about the
movie <i>Wait Until Dark</i>.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.814
Richard Crenna
was in that.

26:03.848 --> 26:06.350
Alan Arkin, too and
they both young.

26:06.383 --> 26:09.120
But it wasn't a teddy
bear, it was a doll,

26:09.153 --> 26:10.254
creepy young girl.

26:10.287 --> 26:11.789
Excuse me, sir?

26:11.822 --> 26:12.890
No, not you.

26:12.923 --> 26:14.191
The young girl in the
movie <i>Wait Til Dark</i>.

26:14.225 --> 26:17.495
It wasn't <i>Wait Until Dark,</i>
it was Charade with

26:17.528 --> 26:18.963
Cary Grant!

26:18.996 --> 26:21.499
Wait, I'm a drug mule.

26:21.532 --> 26:24.368
Uh, I am not stuffing anything
inside any body cavities.

26:24.401 --> 26:27.004
Nobody is stuffing anythin'
in your ass.

26:27.037 --> 26:28.639
Unless you want 'em to.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.875
No drugs inside,
nothin' inside

26:30.908 --> 26:33.511
but the factory stuffin'
from Taiwan.

26:33.544 --> 26:35.679
Today was just a test.

26:35.713 --> 26:36.547
What?

26:36.581 --> 26:37.715
Uh, what do you mean?

26:37.748 --> 26:38.716
A test for what?

26:38.749 --> 26:40.384
To see if we
could trust you.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.886
And to see if you
were competent.

26:41.919 --> 26:43.154
A little bit of both.

26:43.187 --> 26:46.924
Trustworthy and competent,
good characteristics

26:46.957 --> 26:48.125
for anyone.

26:48.159 --> 26:50.294
So you were just
screwing with me?

26:50.327 --> 26:52.997
If you call $400 merely
"screwing with you",

26:53.030 --> 26:55.399
then salud, Miss Sarah.

26:55.432 --> 26:56.500
Did you see
that movie Ted?

26:56.534 --> 26:58.969
This guy looks
like the guy Ted.

26:59.003 --> 26:59.970
Mr. Danny.

27:00.004 --> 27:01.138
Mr. Tommy.

27:01.172 --> 27:02.873
- It's Mr. Danny.
- It's Tommy.

27:02.907 --> 27:04.175
It's Danny.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.578
Whatever, that guy,
he's a friends with the uncle

27:06.611 --> 27:08.946
of some dude I was doin'
a few months back.

27:08.979 --> 27:10.881
Charming.

27:10.915 --> 27:13.417
10 points.

27:14.385 --> 27:16.420
- Hey, girls.
- How's it going?

27:16.453 --> 27:17.589
Just tryin' to help
Sarah with a little

27:17.622 --> 27:19.390
gainful employment.

27:19.423 --> 27:21.058
Yeah, what do you
guys do for money?

27:21.091 --> 27:22.159
Don't ask.

27:22.193 --> 27:24.161
- Lap dances.
- That's funny.

27:24.195 --> 27:26.797
We're strippers.

27:26.830 --> 27:27.965
Wait, seriously?

27:27.998 --> 27:29.033
Where?

27:29.066 --> 27:30.367
Never in the city.

27:30.401 --> 27:31.702
You never know who's gonna walk
through the door.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.437
Right, like New Jersey
and Long Island.

27:33.470 --> 27:35.674
Anywhere except Manhattan.

27:35.706 --> 27:37.208
We can hook you up, Sarah.

27:37.241 --> 27:38.976
No experience necessary.

27:39.009 --> 27:40.711
Um, no thanks.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.780
I think I'll just stick
with Luna's friends.

27:42.813 --> 27:44.148
Suit yourself.

27:44.181 --> 27:45.316
Let us know if you
change your mind.

27:45.349 --> 27:47.985
Um, thank you.

27:48.018 --> 27:50.555
Who do I have to kill
to get some service around...

27:50.589 --> 27:53.123
Oh my God!

27:53.157 --> 27:54.559
In the corner!

27:54.593 --> 27:56.561
- It's K-Square.
- Wait, Kate Kerrigan?

27:56.595 --> 27:59.463
- Where?
- Back there.

27:59.496 --> 28:01.700
Oh my God, she is only
legit movie star to

28:01.732 --> 28:04.468
come out of our
school in decades.

28:04.501 --> 28:06.971
Is it like super uncool
if we go and talk to her?

28:07.004 --> 28:09.039
Hell, yeah.

28:09.073 --> 28:10.474
- Fuck it.
- Let's go.

28:15.045 --> 28:16.681
So sorry to bother you.

28:16.715 --> 28:19.216
The four of us actually go
to the same school as you.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.518
- As you did.
- That you went to.

28:21.553 --> 28:24.321
Conservatory.

28:24.355 --> 28:27.958
- Is that the new Bradley...
- Is Mashmeyer still there?

28:27.992 --> 28:30.060
Oh, yeah.

28:30.094 --> 28:31.428
She hated me.

28:31.462 --> 28:32.664
Wait, really?

28:32.697 --> 28:34.365
She hates me, too.

28:34.398 --> 28:35.532
And Sheldrake?

28:35.567 --> 28:36.867
Mmhmm.

28:36.900 --> 28:41.038
My ass was always black
and blue after his class.

28:41.071 --> 28:42.840
What about that
prick, Homburg?

28:42.873 --> 28:44.541
Still a prick.

28:44.576 --> 28:47.278
Yeah, well, you should
watch out for him.

28:47.311 --> 28:50.447
So could you come speak
at our school sometime?

28:50.481 --> 28:52.816
I'd rather
contract small pox.

28:52.850 --> 28:55.620
But really, let me ask you
something, did any of you

28:55.654 --> 28:58.255
have to audition
to get in?

29:00.124 --> 29:02.192
Of course not.

29:02.226 --> 29:04.128
They'll take
anyone who can pay.

29:04.161 --> 29:06.430
Uh, no offense, girls.

29:06.463 --> 29:08.700
And believe me, they do
nothing to prepare you

29:08.733 --> 29:12.803
for the real world, for
the realities of the business.

29:12.836 --> 29:15.640
So, how did you make it
then, Miss Kerrigan?

29:15.674 --> 29:18.108
You've only been
out for a few years.

29:18.142 --> 29:19.678
Luck?

29:19.711 --> 29:23.113
Some luck,
but mostly really hard work.

29:23.147 --> 29:25.282
I started out doing
student films, short films,

29:25.316 --> 29:27.752
even background
in big movies.

29:27.786 --> 29:29.253
Yuck, extra work?

29:29.286 --> 29:30.588
Don't knock it.

29:30.622 --> 29:32.856
That's how I got into
the union and I was

29:32.890 --> 29:34.391
upgraded twice.

29:34.425 --> 29:36.093
1,000 bucks a day.

29:36.126 --> 29:38.128
Not a bad day's work.

29:38.162 --> 29:39.798
And when you get out
of conservatory,

29:39.830 --> 29:41.398
keep taking classes.

29:41.432 --> 29:43.967
There are so many good
places to study like

29:44.001 --> 29:48.272
One on One on West 27th
Street, And for God's sake,

29:48.305 --> 29:50.074
create your own
work, short films,

29:50.107 --> 29:52.577
plays, one-person shows.

29:53.911 --> 29:56.246
Damn, I really wish
I could keep talking,

29:56.280 --> 29:58.549
but I have a meeting
with my agent.

29:58.583 --> 30:01.720
Thank you so much for
your time, Miss Kerrigan.

30:01.753 --> 30:05.489
Oh, and most important,
don't drink the Kool-Aid.

30:07.958 --> 30:09.026
Hey, let's go, Katie.

30:09.059 --> 30:10.729
Car's waitin' outside.

30:10.762 --> 30:14.465
Ladies, my agent,
Abram Bernstein.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.969
Are you looking for
any new clients?

30:19.002 --> 30:20.904
What have you done?

30:20.938 --> 30:23.708
- Nothing yet, but I'm abo...
- I did a commercial for public access.

30:23.742 --> 30:24.709
Me, too.

30:24.743 --> 30:26.944
Um, we have a showcase
coming up at our school

30:26.977 --> 30:28.345
- pretty soon.
- Great.

30:28.379 --> 30:30.080
So call me when you've
done something.

30:30.114 --> 30:31.649
Somethin' professional.

30:31.683 --> 30:33.685
Ready?

30:33.718 --> 30:36.387
And you should think
about gettin' a nose job.

30:39.256 --> 30:40.759
- I do not need that.
- Bye.

30:43.595 --> 30:45.295
I know the drill,
I wasn't followed.

30:47.231 --> 30:49.032
You're a little fuckin'
wise-ass.

30:49.066 --> 30:50.769
I like that.

30:50.802 --> 30:51.969
Mr. Tommy.

30:52.002 --> 30:53.370
What do you want?

30:53.404 --> 30:56.808
This little wise-ass
friend Sarah is back.

30:56.841 --> 30:59.309
I don't feel totally
comfortable with all this.

30:59.343 --> 31:01.646
Then why'd you come back?

31:01.679 --> 31:03.748
I just want to know
what it's all about.

31:03.782 --> 31:06.450
Well, come back tomorrow,
we'll take a little field trip.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.791
Michael Kors hand bags.

31:12.824 --> 31:14.692
- Hmm.
- Hermes scarves.

31:14.726 --> 31:16.160
Rolex watches.

31:16.193 --> 31:18.630
North Face jackets.

31:18.663 --> 31:21.064
Nike sneakers.

31:21.098 --> 31:22.399
- Watches...
- Right.

31:22.433 --> 31:24.636
All this beautiful
stuff and it's all fake.

31:24.669 --> 31:25.670
Right.

31:25.703 --> 31:28.238
And don't forget the
Beats by Dre headphones,

31:28.272 --> 31:30.974
I use 'em myself.

31:31.008 --> 31:34.278
- So you guys are...
- We're in the wholesale/retail business

31:34.311 --> 31:35.212
you might say.

31:35.245 --> 31:36.947
Well put.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.651
Sarah.

31:39.684 --> 31:43.220
You can take great pride
that you're a cog

31:43.253 --> 31:44.955
in a well-oiled machine.

31:44.988 --> 31:48.258
A small cog, but
an important cog.

31:48.292 --> 31:50.695
We can't offer you
medical and dental,

31:50.728 --> 31:53.530
but your gross pay is
your take-home pay.

31:53.565 --> 31:58.268
Federal, state, city taxes,
you are exempt, my friend.

31:58.302 --> 31:59.604
By the way, you
play softball?

31:59.637 --> 32:01.071
What?

32:01.104 --> 32:03.775
Well, we need a shortstop for
our company softball team.

32:03.808 --> 32:05.610
You don't have to hit
much, but you know,

32:05.643 --> 32:07.978
make a few plays
in the field.

32:08.011 --> 32:10.949
What if the cops find
out about this place?

32:10.981 --> 32:12.917
About the softball team?

32:12.951 --> 32:14.051
I was just kiddin'.

32:14.084 --> 32:15.085
We don't have a softball team.

32:15.118 --> 32:17.221
No, no, about this place.

32:17.254 --> 32:19.657
This... this
well-oiled machine.

32:19.691 --> 32:21.960
We are the cops.

32:23.695 --> 32:25.262
Retired.

32:25.295 --> 32:27.064
But once a cop,
always a cop.

32:27.097 --> 32:28.298
Right, Tommy?

32:28.332 --> 32:29.266
You got that right.

32:29.299 --> 32:30.969
Semper blue.

32:31.001 --> 32:33.470
All you have to do is make
a pick up every day and

32:33.504 --> 32:35.172
bring it back here.

32:35.205 --> 32:36.540
A pick up?

32:36.574 --> 32:39.009
I assume you don't mean
another teddy bear?

32:39.042 --> 32:40.110
No.

32:40.143 --> 32:43.046
Just the daily haul
from this place.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.181
I don't know.

32:44.214 --> 32:46.216
I mean it seems dangerous.

32:46.250 --> 32:49.353
Sarah, you're just
the messenger.

32:49.386 --> 32:53.090
No one ever kills the
messenger, right?

32:53.123 --> 32:55.760
I mean if you were a guy,
I'd tell you to grow a pair,

32:55.793 --> 32:57.629
but I think you
have a pair already,

32:57.662 --> 32:59.363
but you just don't know
where they are yet.

32:59.396 --> 33:01.265
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, no, no, no,

33:01.298 --> 33:02.901
please,
let me finish here.

33:02.934 --> 33:04.769
You have a conscience.

33:04.802 --> 33:06.771
This jungle of a city
hasn't taken that

33:06.804 --> 33:08.472
away from you yet.

33:08.505 --> 33:12.376
I had a conscience
once, and so did Mr. Danny.

33:12.409 --> 33:16.480
Well, let me allow you
in on a little secret.

33:16.513 --> 33:18.983
No one has ever made it
through this world without

33:19.017 --> 33:20.585
cutting any corners.

33:20.618 --> 33:23.688
Not the homeless guy sleepin'
in front of your buildin',

33:23.721 --> 33:25.255
not the Mayor of
City of New York,

33:25.289 --> 33:27.759
not the richest man on Earth,
and the key is to

33:27.792 --> 33:31.796
cut the right corners and
not push your luck.

33:31.829 --> 33:34.298
We are offering you
gainful employment here.

33:34.331 --> 33:36.500
Low risk, high reward.

33:36.533 --> 33:38.368
You may get arrested
once or twice, but that's

33:38.402 --> 33:40.038
par for the course.

33:40.070 --> 33:43.908
But nobody's gonna hurt
and that's not a small thing.

33:50.314 --> 33:52.717
So I've decided I'm no
longer gonna work for

33:52.750 --> 33:54.384
Mr. Danny anymore.

33:54.418 --> 33:56.086
Just too wrong.

33:56.119 --> 33:58.088
So are you back to the
whole quitting thing again?

33:58.121 --> 33:59.256
You mean like leave town?

33:59.289 --> 34:01.325
- Yeah.
- No.

34:01.358 --> 34:03.628
I just need to find
a respectable job.

34:03.661 --> 34:06.163
I guess my career
as a waitress is inevitable.

34:06.196 --> 34:07.832
You mean nanny.

34:07.865 --> 34:09.067
Like baby-sitting?

34:09.099 --> 34:12.737
Sarah, haven't you heard nanny
is the new waitressing?

34:12.770 --> 34:14.973
Alright.

34:16.406 --> 34:18.108
Hey.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.176
How we doin'?

34:19.208 --> 34:20.277
Business is goin'
great, boss.

34:20.310 --> 34:22.013
- There is a lot of orders comin' in.
- Oh yeah.

34:22.045 --> 34:23.815
The phone's ringin'
off the hook.

34:23.848 --> 34:24.815
What about that girl?

34:24.849 --> 34:27.685
- She called me back?
- Not that I'm aware, no.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.088
Keep an eye on her,
and get me a cup of coffee,

34:30.120 --> 34:32.724
and hurry back.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.166
I assume that
you're like every other

34:43.199 --> 34:46.402
socially-awkward
millennial and you spend

34:46.436 --> 34:48.873
the vast majority of your
time with your face buried

34:48.906 --> 34:50.708
in front of your...
your iPhone, right?

34:50.742 --> 34:53.275
Pretty
much, except I actually

34:53.310 --> 34:54.378
don't have an iPhone.

34:54.411 --> 34:56.146
I have a Blackberry.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.849
A Blackberry.

34:57.882 --> 34:59.449
Oy.

34:59.483 --> 35:00.852
Well, listen,
my kid's not like that.

35:00.885 --> 35:04.722
You see, she spends most
of her time with her face

35:04.756 --> 35:07.224
buried in books.

35:08.593 --> 35:11.161
That's a novel
concept, isn't it?

35:13.296 --> 35:16.500
She's not a whore,
my Heather.

35:16.533 --> 35:18.903
I think that's great, Gail.

35:20.504 --> 35:22.040
So I'm just
gonna be... I'm gonna be

35:22.073 --> 35:25.143
brutally upfront and
honest with you,

35:25.175 --> 35:27.879
and if you have a problem with
anything I'm about to say,

35:27.912 --> 35:30.547
then you can just get the
fuck out of my house.

35:30.581 --> 35:32.083
Of course.

35:32.116 --> 35:36.520
Please do not use any foul
language in front of my kid.

35:36.554 --> 35:38.422
If I find out you're
doing that, I'm gonna take

35:38.455 --> 35:41.592
your mouth and I'm gonna
drag it out in the street.

35:41.626 --> 35:43.493
Y... and if you bring your
boyfriend up here and

35:43.527 --> 35:46.964
I find out that you guys
are sucking or fucking,

35:46.998 --> 35:49.266
I don't know what
you people do,

35:49.299 --> 35:51.234
I'm gonna break both your legs.

35:51.268 --> 35:52.603
And drugs?

35:52.637 --> 35:55.272
Don't even get me
started on that!

35:57.008 --> 35:59.110
Do you use Molly?

35:59.143 --> 36:01.478
Sorry, who's Molly?

36:01.511 --> 36:03.547
If you bring any drugs
into my house that

36:03.581 --> 36:05.183
are stronger than a baby
aspirin,

36:05.215 --> 36:06.651
I'll break both your legs.

36:06.684 --> 36:10.287
Then, and only then, will I take
you to the police.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.124
Have I made myself
perfectly clear?

36:13.157 --> 36:14.158
Clear as a bell.

36:17.028 --> 36:18.930
Welcome to my house.

36:21.032 --> 36:22.066
I'm done with my homework.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.134
Awesome.

36:23.167 --> 36:24.234
And are you girls hungry?

36:24.267 --> 36:25.670
Uh, tough question.

36:25.703 --> 36:28.139
Okay, let
me re-phrase that.

36:28.172 --> 36:30.208
Um, are you girls hungry?

36:30.240 --> 36:32.275
Right now, all I do
is binge and purge.

36:32.309 --> 36:33.911
That's not a good
idea, Heather.

36:33.945 --> 36:36.147
Um, Lola, doesn't
Sarah look fat?

36:36.180 --> 36:37.682
Totally.

36:37.715 --> 36:39.917
I think she's doing
the binge without the purge.

36:39.951 --> 36:41.586
Total porker,
needs to purge.

36:41.619 --> 36:43.955
- Excuse me?
- Do you wanna get high?

36:43.988 --> 36:45.022
Shit, yeah.

36:45.056 --> 36:46.691
- What are you talking about?
- Get high.

36:46.724 --> 36:48.092
Yeah, I have some Buddha
stick up in my room

36:48.126 --> 36:48.993
some junior high
kid sold me.

36:49.026 --> 36:50.293
Nice.

36:50.327 --> 36:52.697
I think this
conversation is over.

36:52.730 --> 36:54.899
Okay, you're not
into it, that's fine.

36:54.932 --> 36:56.601
Just don't tell
my mom, okay?

36:56.634 --> 36:59.469
She's still pissed that
I got dropped back a grade.

36:59.503 --> 37:00.571
Again.

37:00.605 --> 37:01.639
Fine.

37:01.672 --> 37:03.708
I'm think I'm gonna
dress like a sexy witch

37:03.741 --> 37:04.942
- for Halloween.
- Hmm?

37:04.976 --> 37:09.312
- You know like red lips, big hair, boobs, ass...
- Yeah.

37:09.346 --> 37:10.447
- Everything.
- I love it.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.449
Wait, what are you doing?

37:12.482 --> 37:13.951
Are you out of your mind?

37:13.985 --> 37:15.553
Not yet.

37:15.586 --> 37:17.121
- Okay, give me that shit.
- Right on!

37:17.155 --> 37:18.321
No, not right on, okay?

37:18.355 --> 37:20.625
This is ridiculous.

37:20.658 --> 37:24.095
Sarah, how many guys
have you fucked in your

37:24.128 --> 37:25.263
life so far?

37:25.295 --> 37:26.998
Jesus Christ.

37:27.031 --> 37:29.133
- Just curious.
- What?

37:29.167 --> 37:30.134
Aren't you like 14?

37:30.168 --> 37:31.334
15.

37:31.368 --> 37:32.837
I'm not a virgin.

37:32.870 --> 37:34.672
Oh, gross!

37:34.705 --> 37:36.240
Oh, I let two boys
finger me last month, and

37:36.274 --> 37:37.909
then I let one of them
fuck me, but he didn't

37:37.942 --> 37:40.945
- come inside me, so...
- Okay, you need to shut the hell up!

37:40.978 --> 37:43.681
My mom hates it when
babysitters curse around me.

37:43.714 --> 37:45.950
Well, your mom
is delusional.

37:45.983 --> 37:48.853
I did not understand
why I needed to babysit girls

37:48.886 --> 37:51.689
that were basically my age
and now I do,

37:51.722 --> 37:53.390
and I'm no
longer your babysitter.

37:53.423 --> 37:54.625
Wait, you're leaving?

37:54.659 --> 37:55.660
Correct.

37:55.693 --> 37:56.828
What a pussy.

37:56.861 --> 37:58.029
Don't ever use that word.

37:58.062 --> 37:59.096
What word?

37:59.130 --> 38:00.665
Uh, you know what word.

38:00.698 --> 38:01.666
The... the P-word.

38:01.699 --> 38:03.100
Pussy, pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy.

38:03.134 --> 38:04.135
Sarah, please don't leave.

38:04.168 --> 38:05.402
I'm so sorry.

38:05.435 --> 38:07.839
I... I know I messed
up, but my mom's gonna

38:07.872 --> 38:09.506
kick my ass for this.

38:11.576 --> 38:16.147
Look, you girls do not need to
grow up so fast, okay?

38:16.180 --> 38:19.283
Just be kids.

38:19.317 --> 38:21.152
You're right.

38:24.421 --> 38:27.091
- Do you wanna do some Molly?
- Oh yeah.

38:27.124 --> 38:28.159
Got the fake IDs, bitches.

38:28.192 --> 38:29.660
Let's party!

38:29.694 --> 38:30.628
Oh, you want one?

38:30.661 --> 38:31.796
50 bucks.

38:33.564 --> 38:35.700
I'm in.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.203
Hey, Mr. Tommy, look
what the cat dragged in.

38:39.237 --> 38:42.405
Yeah, you said
she'd be back.

38:42.439 --> 38:44.041
Fuckin' cheesecake,
give me the run.

39:45.937 --> 39:47.004
The money is good.

39:47.038 --> 39:48.072
And it's harmless, right?

39:48.105 --> 39:49.807
I mean nobody's
getting hurt.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.243
A victimless crime if
there ever was one.

39:52.276 --> 39:54.078
Just don't live
above your means.

39:54.111 --> 39:55.746
What do you mean?

39:55.780 --> 39:56.948
Don't flaunt it.

39:56.981 --> 39:58.049
Keep it to yourself.

39:58.082 --> 39:59.750
The last thing you wanna
do is draw attention

39:59.784 --> 40:01.819
to yourself.

40:01.852 --> 40:04.121
So I shouldn't buy that
new apartment, should I?

40:04.155 --> 40:05.323
Not yet.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.242
Troy Remy is one director

40:25.276 --> 40:27.311
that you want to be
obsessed with you.

40:27.345 --> 40:29.780
I mean have you seen
his last film <i>The Fault Within?</i>

40:29.814 --> 40:31.182
No.

40:31.215 --> 40:32.950
It's friggin' intense.

40:32.984 --> 40:34.352
Uh, is it on Netflix?

40:34.385 --> 40:36.486
I have no idea,
check it out.

40:37.822 --> 40:42.860
And at one point, he pulls out
a Blackberry.

40:42.893 --> 40:44.228
You believe that?

40:44.261 --> 40:46.197
A fuckin' Blackberry.

40:48.265 --> 40:50.735
Hey, ladies,
what's happening tonight?

40:50.768 --> 40:52.236
How you doin'?

40:52.269 --> 40:55.239
- Yeah, no, just...
- Yeah.

40:57.608 --> 41:02.446
So Troy was wondering if
you might like to join him.

41:03.581 --> 41:07.852
So why doesn't he
ask me himself?

41:07.885 --> 41:10.888
Is that really what you
want me to tell him?

41:10.921 --> 41:12.957
Are you sure?

41:12.990 --> 41:15.593
Absopositively?

41:17.995 --> 41:20.297
Okay.

41:27.505 --> 41:30.207
Right then and there, I
knew this guy was a clown.

41:30.241 --> 41:32.576
Someone not worth
any of my time.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.749
Could you
freshen this for me, sweetie?

41:38.783 --> 41:40.618
White wine spritzer.

41:40.651 --> 41:42.787
Heavy on the spritz.

41:42.820 --> 41:44.922
You want me to get
you another drink?

41:44.955 --> 41:46.323
Isn't that your job?

41:46.357 --> 41:47.792
White wine spritzer.

41:47.825 --> 41:51.362
Um, I can get you another drink,
but it's not my job

41:51.395 --> 41:54.198
to get you another drink,
sweetie.

41:54.231 --> 41:55.332
I'll get you another
drink though,

41:55.366 --> 41:57.668
'cause it's the polite thing
to do.

41:57.701 --> 42:00.071
Never mind.

42:00.104 --> 42:02.640
Nice dress.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.811
I still shoot on film.

42:06.844 --> 42:08.479
Fuck digital.

42:08.512 --> 42:12.316
And fuck those YouTube and Snapchat hacks.

42:12.349 --> 42:15.586
I'm the true heir to
John Ford and Howard Hawks.

42:17.888 --> 42:20.291
Ladies, I got an idea.

42:20.324 --> 42:25.296
To me, the real party
is the after-party.

42:25.329 --> 42:27.298
I think it's time I gave
everyone their walkin' papers

42:27.331 --> 42:29.467
except for you two.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.435
No after-party.

42:31.469 --> 42:34.605
My girl Sarah has three big
auditions tomorrow.

42:34.638 --> 42:37.208
Two studio features
and an indie.

42:39.043 --> 42:40.611
That's cool.

42:40.644 --> 42:42.713
That's cool.

42:42.746 --> 42:44.648
Live for another day.

42:45.883 --> 42:47.284
I get it.

42:47.318 --> 42:49.820
Good luck on
that audition.

42:53.791 --> 42:55.192
Hey.

42:55.226 --> 42:56.794
Why are we
leaving so early?

42:56.827 --> 42:58.662
I thought you said you wanted
him to be obsessed with me.

42:58.696 --> 43:00.297
And he is.

43:00.331 --> 43:02.567
But I also want him to
think that other directors

43:02.601 --> 43:04.268
are obsessed with you.

43:04.301 --> 43:05.703
Look, if you wanna go
fuck his brains out tonight,

43:05.736 --> 43:06.704
feel free.

43:06.737 --> 43:09.073
Go back up there.

43:09.106 --> 43:11.742
You'll get your chance
with him and he knows it.

43:16.881 --> 43:18.315
Yeah.

43:18.349 --> 43:19.618
Hmm.

43:19.650 --> 43:21.952
If she's as pretty as you
say, you better kick-start

43:21.986 --> 43:23.787
those moves of yours.

43:23.821 --> 43:25.156
Otherwise, one of those
Wall Street douche bags

43:25.189 --> 43:27.992
is gonna pounce on her.

43:28.025 --> 43:30.094
What?

43:32.263 --> 43:36.133
She's not the type that
go for a Wall Street douche bag.

43:36.167 --> 43:38.035
Don't be so sure of that.

43:38.068 --> 43:40.304
These girls come from
small town USA

43:40.337 --> 43:42.574
and they get dollar
signs in their eyes.

43:42.607 --> 43:44.008
Make your move, Frankie.

43:44.041 --> 43:46.443
Make your move.

43:48.179 --> 43:49.280
Thank you so much.

43:49.313 --> 43:50.447
Have a lovely night.

43:50.481 --> 43:51.815
Thank you.

43:51.849 --> 43:52.983
Oh, no, no, no.

43:53.017 --> 43:54.685
- No way!
- What?

43:54.718 --> 43:55.853
I can't let you pay.

43:55.886 --> 43:57.855
We split it 50/50.

43:57.888 --> 44:00.659
I pay for all my dates.

44:00.691 --> 44:03.427
This isn't a date.

44:03.460 --> 44:06.297
Well, okay, but uh, aren't
you a starving artist?

44:06.330 --> 44:07.932
You know,
I'm your neighbor.

44:07.965 --> 44:12.303
- This is my welcome to the neighbor...
- It's okay.

44:12.336 --> 44:15.005
- Dinner.
- It's okay.

44:15.039 --> 44:17.609
Seriously.

44:17.642 --> 44:20.978
Dougie, think our boy
Frankie here is in love.

44:21.011 --> 44:22.079
Oh.

44:22.112 --> 44:23.147
Oh, shit, that...

44:23.180 --> 44:25.049
I thought it was somethin'
important.

44:25.082 --> 44:27.084
Seriously, Frankie,

44:27.117 --> 44:28.219
are you in love
with this Sarah girl?

44:28.252 --> 44:30.988
Frankie, don't answer
these guys, okay?

44:31.021 --> 44:31.989
What?

44:32.022 --> 44:33.224
What's wrong?

44:33.257 --> 44:35.125
Because Frankie is sweet
and I don't want you

44:35.159 --> 44:37.094
guys making fun of him
for being in love and shit

44:37.127 --> 44:38.295
like that.

44:38.329 --> 44:40.130
Frankie is my boy.

44:40.164 --> 44:41.633
Right, Frankie,
you my boy?

44:41.666 --> 44:43.200
Yeah, you're my boy.

44:43.234 --> 44:44.835
Am I anybody's boy?

44:44.868 --> 44:46.203
- No!
- No!

44:47.371 --> 44:50.709
Ladies, welcome to
stage combat class.

44:50.741 --> 44:52.577
Now, it's very important for you
to remember

44:52.611 --> 44:56.180
two universal
rules to guarantee safety

44:56.213 --> 44:59.450
at all times during
a stage performance.

44:59.483 --> 45:03.787
Rule number 1 is to
always, always, always

45:03.821 --> 45:06.290
make eye contact
with the person

45:06.323 --> 45:08.025
that you're working with.

45:08.058 --> 45:10.861
Rule number 2 is
always make sure that

45:10.894 --> 45:13.764
there's more than adequate
distance between you

45:13.797 --> 45:16.735
and the actual target
that you're aiming at to

45:16.767 --> 45:19.336
avoid accidental contact.

45:19.370 --> 45:20.871
Do I make myself clear?

45:22.206 --> 45:23.907
Eye contact.

45:23.941 --> 45:25.542
Eye contact.

45:25.577 --> 45:28.680
- Eye contact.
- I wanna slap you in the face right now.

45:30.848 --> 45:32.584
Eye contact.

45:35.687 --> 45:38.422
Ow!

45:39.456 --> 45:41.492
Okay, remember eye
contact, safe distance

45:41.525 --> 45:43.227
- from...
- Oh.

45:43.260 --> 45:45.296
It's so soft.

45:47.364 --> 45:49.266
Okay, I'd think
twice, like did you...

45:53.705 --> 45:55.039
"Fie!

45:55.072 --> 45:56.708
Fie!

45:56.741 --> 45:58.008
Fie!

45:58.042 --> 46:01.111
Sword and shield,
in bloody field,

46:01.145 --> 46:04.882
doth win immortal fame.

46:04.915 --> 46:09.086
Gallop apace, you
fiery-footed steeds."

46:10.722 --> 46:12.791
Josette, what say you?

46:12.823 --> 46:15.359
"Love looks not with
the eyes, But with the mind,

46:15.392 --> 46:18.697
and therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind,"

46:18.730 --> 46:21.265
A Midsummer Night's Dream,
Act I, Scene I.

46:23.434 --> 46:26.738
"All the world is a stage,

46:26.771 --> 46:29.406
and all the men and
women merely players.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.076
They have their exits
and their entrances,

46:32.109 --> 46:35.312
and one man in his time
plays many parts,"

46:35.346 --> 46:38.382
As You Like It,
Act II, Scene VII.

46:39.883 --> 46:41.852
"Doubt thou the stars
are fire,

46:41.885 --> 46:44.922
doubt that the sun doth move,
doubt truth to be a liar,

46:44.955 --> 46:46.825
but never doubt I love."

46:46.857 --> 46:49.193
Hamlet, Act II, Scene II.

46:52.296 --> 46:54.733
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

46:54.766 --> 46:57.569
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

46:57.602 --> 47:00.304
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

47:00.337 --> 47:03.374
And summer's lease hath
all too short a date."

47:03.407 --> 47:05.008
Sonnet 18.

47:06.143 --> 47:09.748
I thank thee, fair
and gentle, Sarah.

47:12.883 --> 47:15.085
So how long have you lived here?

47:15.119 --> 47:17.521
Seems like forever and a day.

47:17.555 --> 47:20.558
I came here with a dream
in my head,

47:20.592 --> 47:23.394
and stars in my eyes,
and I was gonna be the next...

47:23.427 --> 47:26.598
You fill in the blank,
the next big something.

47:26.631 --> 47:27.931
Show business?

47:27.965 --> 47:31.168
I was a singer,
dancer, actress,

47:31.201 --> 47:35.172
comedienne, but mostly
I was a waitress.

47:35.205 --> 47:37.508
And then I met
my first husband.

47:37.541 --> 47:40.578
It happened he was someone
else's husband at the same time

47:40.612 --> 47:42.814
and he swept me off
my feet and I never had to

47:42.847 --> 47:44.948
work another
day in my life.

47:44.982 --> 47:46.584
So what was New
York like back then?

47:46.618 --> 47:49.253
I've heard so much about
it from my grandpa.

47:49.286 --> 47:53.390
Oh, better in some ways
and worse in others.

47:53.424 --> 47:56.861
Just like
everything else in life.

47:56.895 --> 48:00.765
The polo grounds,
the old Penn Station,

48:00.799 --> 48:03.233
the uh,...

48:03.267 --> 48:06.503
...Fillmore East,
the Bellmore Cafeteria,

48:06.537 --> 48:10.441
the Rivoli Theaters,
they're all gone.

48:13.912 --> 48:15.979
Here, I'm gonna
show you something?

48:16.013 --> 48:18.949
Hey, could you recommend
a decent laundry service?

48:26.825 --> 48:29.594
So how about
you and Frankie?

48:29.627 --> 48:31.395
Me and Frankie?

48:31.428 --> 48:34.131
Um... Don't worry,
intra-apartment dating

48:34.164 --> 48:36.467
is not forbidden.

48:36.500 --> 48:41.071
No, uh, I mean he's nice
I guess, but we're not dating.

48:41.104 --> 48:43.073
I didn't come to Manhattan to
find a husband.

48:43.106 --> 48:44.642
Who said anything
about a husband?

48:44.676 --> 48:46.543
Look.

48:46.578 --> 48:47.912
Look at that.

48:47.946 --> 48:49.112
Do you recognize that handsome face?

48:49.146 --> 48:50.514
Grandpa.

48:50.547 --> 48:52.617
That is definitely
my grandpa.

48:52.650 --> 48:54.017
Sure is.

48:54.051 --> 48:55.352
Oh, I miss him.

48:55.385 --> 48:56.654
Oh.

49:07.264 --> 49:08.566
Hello.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.803
I got you a meeting today
with Troy Remy today at 9:00.

49:11.836 --> 49:13.370
Wait, 9:00?

49:13.403 --> 49:14.839
Shit, that's
like right now.

49:14.873 --> 49:17.575
9:00 p.m.

49:17.609 --> 49:19.276
Oh, tonight?

49:19.309 --> 49:21.545
<i>Mmhmm, it's
at the loft we were at the other night.</i>

49:21.579 --> 49:25.850
<i>Get there early and</i>
uh, oh, wear something hot.

49:25.884 --> 49:26.885
Hot.

49:26.918 --> 49:28.118
Got ya.

49:28.151 --> 49:30.153
Fucking hot.

49:30.187 --> 49:32.222
I don't think I have anything
that's fuckin' hot.

49:32.256 --> 49:35.994
Then get something
fucking hot.

49:36.026 --> 49:38.161
Jesus Christ,

49:40.832 --> 49:41.966
Oh, what the
fuck is in this?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.167
Jesus Christ.

49:48.171 --> 49:50.642
Grandpa?

49:51.943 --> 49:53.544
What are you doing here?

49:53.578 --> 49:55.013
I came to see you.

49:55.045 --> 49:56.513
Why didn't you tell me?

49:56.547 --> 49:58.415
I wanted to
surprise you, honey.

49:58.448 --> 50:00.217
Oh.

50:00.250 --> 50:01.886
You're looking great.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.054
Oh, it so, so good
to see you, grandpa.

50:04.087 --> 50:05.023
Helena's gonna be really
excited, too.

50:05.055 --> 50:06.189
- Come on.
- Thank you.

50:06.223 --> 50:07.792
- Let's go in.
- Thank you, honey.

50:10.060 --> 50:11.528
Yeah, honey, you seem to be
taking well

50:11.563 --> 50:13.831
to this city, you know?

50:13.865 --> 50:15.900
Yeah, I've made some cool
friends and

50:15.934 --> 50:17.167
I'm starting to really
feel like I'm part

50:17.200 --> 50:20.337
- of the fabric, you know?
- Uh, well.

50:20.370 --> 50:23.340
Maybe I'll take grandma down
here for a long weekend.

50:23.373 --> 50:26.143
Just take her to s...
a musical or these things.

50:26.176 --> 50:27.477
That would be awesome.

50:27.511 --> 50:29.212
She would love that.

50:29.246 --> 50:32.215
Get tickets to The
Producers, please.

50:32.249 --> 50:34.084
Well, that's going
to be tough, grandpa.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.820
The Producers
closed years ago.

50:37.387 --> 50:40.390
- That all I know about Broadway.
- Just a sec.

50:40.424 --> 50:42.594
Where are you goin' now?

50:44.461 --> 50:46.898
And I made you some
of my famous split pea soup.

50:46.931 --> 50:49.499
- Oh.
- Thank you.

50:49.533 --> 50:51.736
I must be dreaming.

50:51.769 --> 50:53.671
You haven't changed a bit.

50:53.705 --> 50:55.807
You always were
a great liar.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.342
Seeing my granddaughter
made my day

50:58.375 --> 51:01.579
and you're icing on
top of the cake, honey.

51:01.613 --> 51:03.881
Oh, flattery will
get you everywhere.

51:03.915 --> 51:05.215
Oh, thank you.

51:05.248 --> 51:06.985
So how long has it been
since you guys have

51:07.018 --> 51:08.052
seen each other?

51:08.086 --> 51:10.253
It was sometime
in the '70s.

51:10.287 --> 51:12.023
Nixon was President I think.

51:12.056 --> 51:12.991
Abe Lincoln I think.

51:13.024 --> 51:13.925
Stop it.

51:13.958 --> 51:15.392
It was 1972.

51:15.425 --> 51:17.662
I remember because
I was marching in the anti-war

51:17.695 --> 51:20.632
protest that day and
you took me to dinner

51:20.665 --> 51:21.833
in Little Italy that night.

51:21.866 --> 51:24.669
Right, I remember.

51:24.702 --> 51:29.073
Sh... she represented every
lost cause in the planet.

51:30.474 --> 51:32.043
How is your wife?

51:32.076 --> 51:34.846
She's great, thank you.

51:34.879 --> 51:37.115
She must be an
amazing woman.

51:37.147 --> 51:41.184
She is to take care of me.

51:41.218 --> 51:44.856
How about I take you two
out for a bite to eat, okay?

51:44.889 --> 51:47.257
See if my favorite
restaurant's still open.

51:47.290 --> 51:49.027
- Oops.
- Ruggiero's.

51:49.060 --> 51:50.327
I'm sorry, grandpa.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.763
I uh, I've got a thing
tonight, I should

51:51.796 --> 51:54.164
really start
getting ready.

51:54.197 --> 51:56.333
Helena, how about
you, honey?

51:56.366 --> 51:57.835
I... I have got
something, too.

51:57.869 --> 51:59.403
I think I should go.

51:59.436 --> 52:02.439
That's great, you
both blowin' me off.

52:03.574 --> 52:05.643
Take care of yourself.

52:08.713 --> 52:10.213
Thank you.

52:10.247 --> 52:12.315
Thank you for taking
care of my kid.

52:32.170 --> 52:35.073
One thing I know is chemistry.

52:35.106 --> 52:37.909
Kinetic chemistry.

52:37.942 --> 52:41.813
Whether in cinema
or in real life.

52:41.846 --> 52:44.015
It's chemistry.

52:44.048 --> 52:46.684
I like our energy.

52:46.718 --> 52:49.020
I like you.

52:49.053 --> 52:52.890
Um, s... s... so um,

52:52.924 --> 52:54.992
are you doing any
new movie soon?

52:55.026 --> 52:57.028
I'm shooting five new
movies soon, just like

52:57.061 --> 52:58.830
Fassbinder did.

52:58.863 --> 53:01.199
40 movies in 13 years.

53:01.231 --> 53:03.266
I just keep goin',
I can't stop.

53:03.300 --> 53:06.503
Cinema is like
a drug to me.

53:06.536 --> 53:09.207
You're like a drug to me.

53:09.239 --> 53:13.144
Um.

53:13.177 --> 53:16.114
Uh, uh, what's your
next movie about?

53:16.147 --> 53:17.815
It's about everything.

53:17.849 --> 53:20.752
It's about this
beautiful girl.

53:20.785 --> 53:25.322
And she's hot, she's sexy,
and she's very pretty.

53:27.658 --> 53:29.894
You know what
I mean, right?

53:29.927 --> 53:31.461
Yeah.

53:31.495 --> 53:32.663
And her smile.

53:32.697 --> 53:37.034
Wow, her smile was made
for the big screen.

53:38.368 --> 53:43.306
And her eyes, they're
sultry, smoky,...

53:45.375 --> 53:48.278
...so sexy.

53:48.311 --> 53:52.116
Her eyes, they
are so deep.

53:52.150 --> 53:54.752
Deeper than any ocean.

53:54.786 --> 53:59.757
Atlantic, Pacific, Indian.

53:59.791 --> 54:04.095
So deep, you just
get lost in them.

54:10.635 --> 54:12.170
Do... do you
have a headache?

54:12.203 --> 54:13.503
No.

54:13.537 --> 54:16.373
This... it's just something to
take the edge off.

54:16.406 --> 54:17.775
Trust me.

54:17.809 --> 54:20.477
It's really good.

55:28.913 --> 55:30.380
Hi.

55:30.413 --> 55:33.184
<i>Sarah, hi.</i>

55:33.217 --> 55:36.020
Troy, hi.

55:36.053 --> 55:38.256
<i>I wanna apologize</i> for running
out on you this morning.

55:38.289 --> 55:39.957
I had an early meeting
with some money guys

55:39.991 --> 55:42.026
who are in
town just for today.

55:42.059 --> 55:43.493
I couldn't blow them off.

55:43.526 --> 55:44.729
Yeah.

55:44.762 --> 55:48.232
Um, yeah, no,
I... I understand.

55:48.266 --> 55:49.499
You okay?

55:49.532 --> 55:52.169
Um, yeah.

55:52.203 --> 55:55.239
Yeah, yeah,
I'm... I'm fine.

55:55.273 --> 55:58.943
Anyway, I'm free right now
and I just wanted to say hi.

55:59.977 --> 56:02.079
And I wanna drop
off your wallet.

56:02.113 --> 56:04.015
I don't know if you know, but
you left it at my place.

56:04.048 --> 56:05.883
Oh shit, my wallet?

56:05.917 --> 56:07.051
Fuck.

56:07.084 --> 56:09.720
Shit, I had no
idea I'd lost it.

56:09.754 --> 56:12.657
No worries,
I've been there.

56:12.690 --> 56:14.358
I'll swing by in
an hour, okay?

56:14.392 --> 56:16.526
Um.

56:21.098 --> 56:23.367
So how was your meeting
today?

56:23.401 --> 56:24.534
It went great.

56:24.568 --> 56:27.571
These people, they got
more money than God

56:27.605 --> 56:29.407
and they're big
fans of my work.

56:29.439 --> 56:30.741
Awesome.

56:30.775 --> 56:31.742
That's really cool.

56:31.776 --> 56:34.278
Yeah, yeah it is.

56:34.312 --> 56:36.614
I know this sounds lame,
but I texted my mom

56:36.647 --> 56:40.251
in Detroit this morning and
I told her all about you.

56:40.284 --> 56:43.354
Seriously?

56:43.387 --> 56:44.689
Seriously.

56:44.722 --> 56:46.357
Wow.

56:46.390 --> 56:47.658
I know.

56:47.692 --> 56:49.660
That's heavy.

56:49.694 --> 56:51.963
Yeah, moms are heavy.

56:51.996 --> 56:56.267
Anyway, I just wanna
keep seeing you.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.903
I wanna know if
that's possible.

56:58.936 --> 57:02.273
Um, sure.

57:02.306 --> 57:05.376
Um, we can keep
hanging out and uh,

57:05.409 --> 57:07.845
I'd love to work with
you on a film.

57:07.878 --> 57:09.914
Are you seein'
anyone right now?

57:09.947 --> 57:12.116
Uh, not really.

57:16.287 --> 57:19.190
Sarah, all I'm asking
for is your time.

57:19.223 --> 57:21.524
Uh.

57:23.160 --> 57:27.098
You had a great time
last night, too, right?

57:28.299 --> 57:30.835
I don't really remember
a lot from last night.

57:30.868 --> 57:33.437
Trust me, it was a good.

57:33.471 --> 57:36.374
It was all good.

58:27.725 --> 58:29.627
- Shit.
- Convention Center.

58:29.660 --> 58:31.929
I am off the duty.

58:31.962 --> 58:33.597
Come on!

58:33.631 --> 58:35.533
Javits Convention Center.

58:35.566 --> 58:36.967
Javits Convention Center.

58:37.001 --> 58:39.870
Yeah, I hear you
first time, okay?

58:39.904 --> 58:41.272
There nothing wrong with
my hearing, but there

58:41.305 --> 58:43.474
is something wrong
with your hearing.

58:43.507 --> 58:44.875
I am off the duty.

58:44.909 --> 58:47.511
I am taking a break.

58:47.545 --> 58:50.981
Maybe this will get
you back on the duty.

58:51.015 --> 58:52.316
You are stupid.

58:52.349 --> 58:53.551
I don't need your money.

58:53.584 --> 58:55.953
I am trying to eat
my lunch and take a break.

58:55.986 --> 58:59.623
Take the Uber, mister,
the Uber, okay?

58:59.657 --> 59:01.325
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

59:01.358 --> 59:02.960
Oh yes.

59:02.993 --> 59:06.330
Maybe the taxi commission
would like to know

59:06.363 --> 59:08.365
that you won't
take me to the freakin'

59:08.399 --> 59:10.634
Convention Center.

59:10.668 --> 59:12.703
You see this,
fuck stick, okay?

59:12.736 --> 59:14.171
NYPD.

59:14.205 --> 59:15.973
How would you like to go
to the Ass Bangers Convention

59:16.006 --> 59:17.041
on Rikers Island?

59:17.074 --> 59:19.076
Now, get the fuck out.

59:19.110 --> 59:20.044
Alright.

59:20.077 --> 59:21.779
Get the fuck out of here.

59:21.812 --> 59:24.181
Douche bag.

59:24.215 --> 59:26.350
Fuckin' idiot.

59:31.222 --> 59:33.124
You're going there, really?

59:33.157 --> 59:34.458
I'm going there really.

59:34.492 --> 59:36.327
You've already gone there.

59:36.360 --> 59:37.361
I've already gone there.

59:37.394 --> 59:39.330
Yeah, I've already
gone there.

59:39.363 --> 59:41.198
I am really going there.

59:41.232 --> 59:43.734
You're really going there.

59:43.767 --> 59:45.002
I'm already here.

59:45.035 --> 59:46.670
You're already here.

59:46.704 --> 59:47.671
Bravo.

59:47.705 --> 59:48.706
Oh my God.

59:48.739 --> 59:49.740
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

59:49.773 --> 59:51.008
Hey.

59:51.041 --> 59:52.743
Hey, hey,
unintelligent talking.

59:52.776 --> 59:53.844
Quiet.

59:53.878 --> 59:55.212
That was beautiful, Luna.

59:55.246 --> 59:56.847
Beautiful!

59:56.881 --> 59:58.716
You know, Meisner
would be proud.

59:58.749 --> 59:59.850
Thanks, Barry.

59:59.884 --> 01:00:03.187
You're very welcome.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.089
Philip.

01:00:05.122 --> 01:00:06.524
I didn't believe you
for two seconds,

01:00:06.558 --> 01:00:07.725
let alone one.

01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:09.594
Thanks, Barry.

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:10.761
Yeah.

01:00:10.794 --> 01:00:13.464
I heard Starbucks
is hiring.

01:00:14.599 --> 01:00:17.101
Sarah, front and center.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.979
Take off your clothes.

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:31.616
I beg your pardon?

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.251
Take the cotton balls
out of your ears

01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:36.520
and take off
your clothes.

01:00:36.555 --> 01:00:40.224
Um, Barry... uh,
Mr.Homburg.

01:00:42.226 --> 01:00:45.496
Do you call yourself
an actress?

01:00:45.529 --> 01:00:46.764
Yes.

01:00:46.797 --> 01:00:49.366
Show us you're an actress.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.938
Take off your clothes
and show us your instrument.

01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:58.943
- Um, Barry, I... I... I really don't...
- Excuse me.

01:00:58.976 --> 01:01:00.978
How could you be a real
actress if you can't get naked

01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:03.714
in front of the world?

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:06.183
Um, I... I... I don't know.

01:01:06.217 --> 01:01:10.120
Look if you're an actress,
you can't be afraid ugh,

01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:12.923
to express naked emotions,
yeah, the...

01:01:12.957 --> 01:01:16.827
the naked body,
the naked truth.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.762
So take off your fucking
clothes right now!

01:01:18.796 --> 01:01:20.864
Barry, please.

01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:23.934
Hey, hey, don't...
don't look...

01:01:23.968 --> 01:01:25.570
Don't look at them,
look at me.

01:01:25.604 --> 01:01:27.071
Over here.

01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:29.073
Right here.

01:01:29.106 --> 01:01:30.374
Now, Josie took off her
clothes in class,

01:01:30.407 --> 01:01:31.643
didn't you, Josie?

01:01:31.676 --> 01:01:34.713
It was uh, liberating?

01:01:34.745 --> 01:01:36.681
Yeah, it was
liberating, see?

01:01:36.715 --> 01:01:37.682
And so did Jasmine.

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:38.683
Didn't you, Jasmine?

01:01:38.717 --> 01:01:40.351
I have an amazing bod.

01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:42.386
Just back off, asshole!

01:01:44.054 --> 01:01:45.356
What did you
just say to me?

01:01:45.389 --> 01:01:46.924
There are plenty of
girls at this school

01:01:46.957 --> 01:01:49.293
who don't seem to mind you
brow-beating them into

01:01:49.326 --> 01:01:53.030
getting naked for you, but
Sarah is not one of them.

01:01:53.063 --> 01:01:54.465
I understand.

01:01:54.498 --> 01:01:56.701
Both of you, get the fuck out of
my class, right now.

01:01:56.735 --> 01:01:57.801
You fucking babies,
both of you.

01:01:57.835 --> 01:01:59.203
You know something,
Barry Homburg?

01:01:59.236 --> 01:02:00.605
Yeah, a lot more than
you do, you little prick.

01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:02.406
Yeah, I know this, you've been
teaching here too long.

01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:03.907
Oh yeah?

01:02:03.941 --> 01:02:05.776
Didn't you start out to be
an actor or a director,

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:07.878
but it didn't work
out for you, did it?

01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:09.179
So you can't stand
the fact that

01:02:09.213 --> 01:02:11.081
you're a fucking failure,
bitch!

01:02:11.115 --> 01:02:13.851
Hey, fuck you and get
the fuck out of my class!

01:02:13.884 --> 01:02:15.452
Come on, Sarah.

01:02:15.486 --> 01:02:17.488
- Let's blow this popsicle stand.
- Thank you.

01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:20.057
And don't expect to be
asked back for second year!

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:21.792
I'll tell you that
right the fuck now!

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:24.161
The cops are gonna love
hearing about all

01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:27.565
the underage kids here you
ply with booze, and weed,

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:29.366
and blow, Barry.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.534
Get out!

01:02:30.568 --> 01:02:31.770
Hear up!

01:02:31.802 --> 01:02:33.404
Vice squad.

01:02:33.437 --> 01:02:34.773
Vice squad, baby!

01:02:34.805 --> 01:02:36.307
Vice squad, my ass.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.308
Bring 'em on!

01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:38.309
Bring on the cops.

01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:39.310
I don't give a shit.

01:02:39.343 --> 01:02:40.177
What am I doin'?

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:42.880
I'm only fuckin'
teaching how to be free.

01:02:42.913 --> 01:02:44.048
Free in this class, right?

01:02:44.081 --> 01:02:46.116
You guys know what I'm
talkin' about, right?

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.552
That guy is not gonna
amount to a fucking thing.

01:02:48.586 --> 01:02:50.120
You see that?

01:02:50.154 --> 01:02:52.956
If he acts like this here,
imagine what he's doin' outside.

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:54.458
His fuckin' father threw him out
of his house,

01:02:54.491 --> 01:02:56.327
I'm... I bet you any money.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.029
I... I want the truth
out of everyone, okay?

01:02:59.063 --> 01:03:00.931
That guy is not gonna
give you the truth.

01:03:00.964 --> 01:03:03.167
You are... what you're
gonna give me is

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.935
the truth, right?

01:03:04.968 --> 01:03:07.504
Jasmine, take off
your clothes again.

01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:09.039
Whatever, Barry.

01:03:09.073 --> 01:03:09.940
Huh.

01:03:14.912 --> 01:03:17.147
Excuse me, is uh,
this seat taken?

01:03:17.181 --> 01:03:18.415
It's all yours.

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:20.050
Thanks.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.986
Hey, guys.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.421
What can I get
you tonight?

01:03:24.455 --> 01:03:26.123
Um...

01:03:26.156 --> 01:03:28.225
That apple martini
looks pretty good.

01:03:28.258 --> 01:03:32.062
An apple a
day keeps somebody away.

01:03:32.096 --> 01:03:34.699
It's... it's the doctor.

01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:36.533
That's
good advice.

01:03:36.568 --> 01:03:37.569
Yeah.

01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:39.269
Can I get you another?

01:03:39.303 --> 01:03:40.971
You can
get me another one.

01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:42.506
Alright, alright, another one.

01:03:42.539 --> 01:03:44.809
Two apple
martinis, please.

01:03:44.843 --> 01:03:46.243
With extra apples.

01:03:46.276 --> 01:03:47.478
With extra apples!

01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:53.283
So what's a babe like you
doin' in a place like this?

01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:55.419
You come here often?

01:03:55.452 --> 01:03:56.387
What's my sign?

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.521
No, no.

01:03:57.555 --> 01:03:58.857
What's your sign?

01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:05.496
That's the best pick
up line I've heard all night.

01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:07.665
Guys.

01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:09.868
- You.
- Mm, mm, yum.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.435
- Thank you.
- Yeah, enjoy.

01:04:11.468 --> 01:04:13.203
Mmm.

01:04:13.237 --> 01:04:14.706
Okay.

01:04:14.739 --> 01:04:17.307
Hmm, hmm.

01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:22.614
I beat ya.

01:04:31.623 --> 01:04:33.090
Excuse me, I gotta
take this call.

01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:34.158
It's my mom.

01:04:34.191 --> 01:04:36.828
- You're excused.
- Don't go anywhere.

01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:38.128
Where am I gonna go?

01:04:38.162 --> 01:04:39.798
The movies?

01:04:43.635 --> 01:04:45.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:45.302 --> 01:04:46.370
Sorry to interrupt.

01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.238
Um, I couldn't help but
overhear what you said

01:04:48.272 --> 01:04:49.574
about the movies.

01:04:49.607 --> 01:04:52.376
Um, there's actually
a good foreign film playin'

01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:54.813
over at the Film Forum.

01:04:54.846 --> 01:04:57.381
- Uh, <i>Les Bonnes Femme</i>.
- <i>Les Bonnes Femm</i>.

01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:02.787
Oh, French fries sound
so good.

01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:03.822
You want... you
want some fries?

01:05:03.855 --> 01:05:05.557
- I can order some?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:08.492
- They're good here.
- French fries with a side of apple martini.

01:05:08.525 --> 01:05:10.929
Mm...

01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:13.197
Hey buddy,
I was sitting there.

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:14.231
Calm down, okay?

01:05:14.264 --> 01:05:16.400
I'm just having a chat
with the nice lady.

01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:18.235
Yeah, I noticed.

01:05:18.268 --> 01:05:20.037
Hey, don't be a fuckin'
hypocrite, okay?

01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:21.538
I've been watching you.

01:05:21.573 --> 01:05:22.740
You've been watching me?

01:05:22.774 --> 01:05:24.374
What are you
some kinda creep?

01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:25.610
Look, I saw her first.

01:05:25.643 --> 01:05:27.779
She's been getting hammered
for the past three hours.

01:05:27.812 --> 01:05:29.513
<i>Les Bonnes Femm</i>.

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:33.918
<i>Les Bonnes Femm</i>.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.388
Oh my God!

01:05:50.234 --> 01:05:52.837
Oh God, I'm never
drinking again.

01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:54.939
- Never?
- Never.

01:05:54.973 --> 01:05:56.440
- Your birthday?
- No.

01:05:56.473 --> 01:05:58.308
- New Year's?
- No.

01:05:58.342 --> 01:06:01.245
- Your wedding?
- I'm never getting married.

01:06:01.278 --> 01:06:04.548
Oh shit.

01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:05.617
Work.

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.317
Mmhmm.

01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:10.588
- Hmm, see ya later.
- Sure.

01:06:10.622 --> 01:06:12.256
- If you're lucky.
- Bye.

01:06:14.692 --> 01:06:16.928
Hello, there.

01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:18.228
Nice weather, huh?

01:06:18.262 --> 01:06:19.864
No?

01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:22.600
Something I said?

01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:24.334
Where are you going?

01:06:24.368 --> 01:06:26.503
Hey, I wanna talk to you.

01:06:27.605 --> 01:06:31.141
Can you please slow down?

01:06:31.174 --> 01:06:33.210
Hello?

01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:35.279
Ms. Quintana!

01:06:35.312 --> 01:06:38.850
Ms. Quintana,
can you stop moving?

01:06:38.883 --> 01:06:40.384
Excuse me?

01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:43.520
No, excuse me.

01:06:43.555 --> 01:06:45.489
Do we know each other?

01:06:45.522 --> 01:06:47.257
Kind of a one-way street.

01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:49.894
You don't know me,
I know you.

01:06:49.928 --> 01:06:51.729
Well, I know about you.

01:06:51.763 --> 01:06:54.666
I have friends on the
NYPD, I'm calling the police.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.501
I am the police.

01:06:57.534 --> 01:07:00.805
I am the NYPD.

01:07:00.838 --> 01:07:03.473
You and I, we need to talk.

01:07:03.507 --> 01:07:06.044
Here's my card.

01:07:06.076 --> 01:07:08.245
I want you to
call me today.

01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:12.717
Actually, I want you to
come and see me today.

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.852
Are we clear?

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:24.428
Look, it's a victimless crime.

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:30.635
Dealing drugs and homicide
are victimless crimes.

01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:31.703
Drugs?

01:07:31.736 --> 01:07:33.370
Homicide?

01:07:33.403 --> 01:07:36.641
What do y... what
do you mean?

01:07:36.674 --> 01:07:40.377
I mean I'm talking
about Troy Remy.

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.946
Troy?

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.414
What are you
talking about?

01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:49.721
I am talking
about Troy fucking Remy.

01:07:49.754 --> 01:07:51.488
You know him?

01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:53.256
Yeah.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.096
Sorry, uh, I don't know
anything about this.

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.635
Why don't you stop
and taken off your sunglasses?

01:08:03.668 --> 01:08:05.870
Why?

01:08:05.903 --> 01:08:08.238
'Cause it's impolite
and stupid to wear sunglasses

01:08:08.271 --> 01:08:11.174
in a closed building.

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:14.812
Well, I don't wanna get arrested
for being impolite.

01:08:14.846 --> 01:08:16.881
Or stupid.

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.853
Oh, that's lovely.

01:08:21.886 --> 01:08:23.621
Did he do that to you?

01:08:23.654 --> 01:08:25.689
Who?

01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:28.960
Your boy, Troy.

01:08:28.993 --> 01:08:30.694
Uh, no.

01:08:32.897 --> 01:08:35.800
Sarah, why don't
I believe you?

01:08:35.832 --> 01:08:38.102
That's your
issue, not mine.

01:08:38.136 --> 01:08:41.639
Well, it's gonna be your
issue, too, if you don't tell me.

01:08:41.673 --> 01:08:44.676
You wanna stay out of trouble,
don't you?

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:47.210
Yes.

01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:49.680
Then talk to me.

01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.654
Do I need a lawyer?

01:08:56.688 --> 01:08:58.790
I don't know,
Sarah, do you?

01:08:58.823 --> 01:09:02.359
Look, Troy is a hot
film director, okay?

01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:04.528
He doesn't need
to sell drugs.

01:09:04.562 --> 01:09:06.930
Did you see <i>The Fault Within</i> ?

01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:10.600
Uh, no, and neither
did anybody else.

01:09:10.635 --> 01:09:15.773
I mean, all told, his films
maybe grossed about 37 bucks.

01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:19.911
He earns his money
from dealing drugs.

01:09:21.344 --> 01:09:24.346
That's how he affords
that swanky loft of his.

01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:26.117
Can you just get
to the point?

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:30.555
Do you know he has five
ODs under his belt?

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:32.522
Only two of the
girls survived.

01:09:32.557 --> 01:09:35.292
What is it you'd like
me to write on your tombstone?

01:09:35.325 --> 01:09:38.228
"I should have listened to
Detective Belson

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.631
when I had the chance."

01:09:40.665 --> 01:09:43.568
I know guys like
this prick.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.671
I have a daughter
your age.

01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:50.875
And she is just as snarky
and know-it-all like you.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:55.479
Now, why don't you
let me help you?

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.267
Move in with me.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.401
Huh?

01:10:18.435 --> 01:10:19.837
Move in with me.

01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:21.371
Be my old lady.

01:10:21.404 --> 01:10:22.439
Your old lady?

01:10:22.472 --> 01:10:24.175
It's just an expression.

01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:25.509
Move in with me.

01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:28.079
We can make lots
of movies together.

01:10:28.112 --> 01:10:32.315
Be my muse like
Dietrich and Sternberg,

01:10:32.349 --> 01:10:33.517
Tippi and Hitchcock.

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:34.919
I'll even act.

01:10:34.952 --> 01:10:38.589
Al Pacino and
Michelle Pfeiffer!

01:10:38.623 --> 01:10:39.757
Isn't it too soon?

01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:41.793
There is no too soon.

01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:44.228
There are either right vibes
and wrong vibes.

01:10:44.262 --> 01:10:46.396
These vibes are right.

01:10:46.429 --> 01:10:48.199
When you know, you know.

01:10:48.232 --> 01:10:50.500
And I know.

01:10:50.534 --> 01:10:52.236
I am not moving
in with him.

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.471
- Sarah.
- What?

01:10:54.504 --> 01:10:57.374
- Well, then just leave.
- That's it?

01:10:57.407 --> 01:11:00.244
- Well...
- Well, what?

01:11:00.278 --> 01:11:02.079
If you leave now, can you
live with yourself knowin'

01:11:02.113 --> 01:11:05.549
that animal is peddling
pills to kids?

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:07.051
I still don't
think that's true.

01:11:07.084 --> 01:11:08.586
Oh, it's true.

01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:11.022
This scumbag has taken
advantage of young girls

01:11:11.055 --> 01:11:14.457
just like yourself and you could
live with that?

01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:17.562
- Habla Español, Señorita Quintana?
- Not really.

01:11:17.595 --> 01:11:19.597
- Si o no?
- No.

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.331
You didn't speak
Spanish at home?

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:24.769
Is this your attempt
at good cop, bad cop?

01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:28.706
What do you think this is?

01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:30.608
Television?

01:11:30.641 --> 01:11:33.311
Honey, this is not
a TV show.

01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:35.313
And you're in a real
quandary,

01:11:35.345 --> 01:11:37.380
because you have to help
yourself

01:11:37.414 --> 01:11:39.449
and you have help us.

01:11:39.482 --> 01:11:41.752
So what are you gonna do?

01:11:41.786 --> 01:11:45.189
The bottom line,
I want Troy Remy

01:11:45.223 --> 01:11:47.859
and you're gonna be
the one to help us!

01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:51.295
So do what you must do.

01:11:51.329 --> 01:11:52.663
I'm not moving
in with him.

01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:53.965
You better listen to
what he's tellin' you

01:11:53.998 --> 01:11:55.498
if you know what's good
for you.

01:11:55.532 --> 01:11:56.499
Then don't move
in with him.

01:11:56.533 --> 01:11:58.202
Be his girl.

01:11:58.236 --> 01:11:59.369
Get close to him.

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.005
Get some intel.

01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:04.108
Help us and help yourself.

01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:05.676
Am I clear?

01:12:29.734 --> 01:12:31.068
Sarah, just remember one thing,

01:12:31.102 --> 01:12:33.204
at the end of the day, they all
just wanna fuck you.

01:12:33.237 --> 01:12:35.505
They wanna fuck you
any which way they can.

01:12:35.538 --> 01:12:38.242
They all wanted to fuck me
and they all wanna fuck you.

01:12:38.276 --> 01:12:41.779
That's why you're in
the world to get fucked.

01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:43.748
I have big plans, mom.

01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:45.950
To hell with
your big plans.

01:12:45.983 --> 01:12:48.986
You don't mean anything
to any of them.

01:12:50.154 --> 01:12:52.290
Who's she?

01:12:52.323 --> 01:12:54.292
I don't know.

01:12:54.325 --> 01:12:56.493
Maybe it's you.

01:12:56.526 --> 01:12:59.130
Maybe it's future you.

01:12:59.163 --> 01:13:01.065
Is she dead?

01:13:01.098 --> 01:13:03.200
Maybe.

01:13:05.703 --> 01:13:08.272
Why did you leave?

01:13:30.628 --> 01:13:31.662
Hey.

01:13:31.696 --> 01:13:32.697
What are you doing here?

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.065
I have class.

01:13:34.098 --> 01:13:37.034
You are ducking me
and I need info.

01:13:37.068 --> 01:13:38.936
Here I am.

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.439
Fine.

01:13:41.471 --> 01:13:43.174
Right, they're cops.

01:13:43.207 --> 01:13:47.544
Well, retired cops, but
once a badge, always a badge.

01:13:47.578 --> 01:13:48.612
That's correct.

01:13:48.646 --> 01:13:50.147
What else?

01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:53.951
They're super creepy,
kinda eccentric.

01:13:53.985 --> 01:13:56.387
I almost think they
might be a couple.

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.621
A couple of what?

01:13:57.655 --> 01:13:59.457
A couple.

01:13:59.489 --> 01:14:02.126
You know like,
a couple couple?

01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:03.526
Interesting.

01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:05.262
But they're not.

01:14:05.296 --> 01:14:07.530
They're not interesting
or they're not a couple?

01:14:07.565 --> 01:14:08.799
Both.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:11.969
No, I mean, neither.

01:14:12.003 --> 01:14:13.104
Okay.

01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:15.306
And you take money back and
forth to this warehouse?

01:14:15.339 --> 01:14:16.874
Correct.

01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:19.110
And these two clowns
are always at the warehouse?

01:14:19.143 --> 01:14:21.679
Yes.

01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:23.546
Okay, I'll look into that.

01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:25.316
No.

01:14:25.349 --> 01:14:27.985
- Excuse me?
- No, this is the trade-off, okay?

01:14:28.019 --> 01:14:30.654
I gave you this and
I'm no longer your rat.

01:14:30.688 --> 01:14:32.490
I want Troy and you'll
do what I ask you to do.

01:14:32.522 --> 01:14:33.557
How's that?

01:14:33.591 --> 01:14:35.292
This is bigger than Troy.

01:14:35.326 --> 01:14:36.494
Oh, really?

01:14:36.526 --> 01:14:38.029
Little girl telling
me my business.

01:14:38.062 --> 01:14:39.797
Look, I'm walking
either way, okay?

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.499
I didn't do
anything wrong.

01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:42.833
How about six to
eight years just for

01:14:42.867 --> 01:14:44.268
carryin' that money?

01:14:44.301 --> 01:14:45.936
I'd be out in 30 months.

01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.972
And you're
willing to do 30 months?

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:51.409
It beats hangin'
out with Troy.

01:14:51.442 --> 01:14:53.644
Just do your fucking
job, alright?

01:14:53.677 --> 01:14:55.346
It's not my job to
tell you how to do

01:14:55.379 --> 01:14:57.948
your fucking job.

01:15:03.954 --> 01:15:05.723
Cops are touting their
bust up

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:08.959
of a $50-million counterfeit
goods ring.

01:15:08.993 --> 01:15:11.128
Hours ago, they raided
a warehouse here on

01:15:11.162 --> 01:15:12.930
Manhattan's West Side.

01:15:12.963 --> 01:15:17.601
The loot: fake Gucci bags,
fake North Face jackets,

01:15:17.635 --> 01:15:20.971
fake Beats
by Dre headphones.

01:15:21.005 --> 01:15:24.175
Who the hell told me
to go into business with you?

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:26.510
I know I was gonna get
locked up eventually,

01:15:26.544 --> 01:15:27.778
fucking great idea.

01:15:27.812 --> 01:15:29.947
I'm goin' first, fuck you.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.782
- Yeah, I dumped her.
- What?

01:15:31.816 --> 01:15:32.950
Are you kidding me?

01:15:32.983 --> 01:15:34.685
Well, what happened to
your delicate flower?

01:15:34.718 --> 01:15:36.554
She was getting too needy.

01:15:36.587 --> 01:15:38.089
<i>So just like that?</i>

01:15:38.122 --> 01:15:39.523
Just like that.

01:15:39.558 --> 01:15:41.592
I don't get you, kid.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:43.627
Well, let's say no
more actresses for me.

01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:45.830
Flaky self-centered
prima donnas, man.

01:15:45.863 --> 01:15:48.567
I'll remind you that next
time you date another one.

01:15:48.599 --> 01:15:51.502
Yeah, well, I don't...
Whoa, wait, Bob,

01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:52.503
I'll talk to you later.

01:15:52.536 --> 01:15:55.072
See you at my bar.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.218
What?

01:16:07.251 --> 01:16:08.352
Sarah!

01:16:08.385 --> 01:16:09.787
Where the fuck you been?

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.155
What about our movie?

01:16:11.188 --> 01:16:13.724
Come on, man, this is very
unprofessional of you.

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:17.528
Sarah?

01:16:17.562 --> 01:16:19.163
<i>Sarah!</i>

01:16:19.196 --> 01:16:20.364
Sarah!

01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:22.867
Fuck!

01:16:32.443 --> 01:16:35.112
Hey, uh, uh, are
you my new neighbor?

01:16:35.146 --> 01:16:36.814
Uh, am I?

01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:38.916
Well, if you're moving
in here, you are.

01:16:38.949 --> 01:16:39.950
I'm Frankie.

01:16:39.984 --> 01:16:42.086
- Frankie Li.
- Um, Ivy.

01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:44.955
Ivy Wellman.

01:16:44.989 --> 01:16:47.391
Enchanté.

01:16:47.424 --> 01:16:48.926
Huh?

01:16:48.959 --> 01:16:50.227
Enchanted.

01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:51.195
You enchant me.

01:16:51.228 --> 01:16:52.429
I'm enchanted.

01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:53.831
Oh.

01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:54.765
Wow.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:56.767
- Me too.
- Allow me.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.638
Okay, just... yeah,
careful with her.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.473
So are you new in town or just
a change of neighborhood?

01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:04.441
Uh, I'm new in town.

01:17:04.475 --> 01:17:06.944
I'm a singer/songwriter,
so you know,

01:17:06.977 --> 01:17:08.679
New York's
the place.

01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:09.947
Well, thank goodness.

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.082
I thought you would be
an actress or something.

01:17:12.116 --> 01:17:13.918
There's too many of
those around New York already.

01:17:13.951 --> 01:17:15.452
Oh, really?

01:17:15.486 --> 01:17:17.421
Under every rock.

01:17:17.454 --> 01:17:20.191
So what are you like
uh, Taylor Swift?

01:17:20.224 --> 01:17:23.194
Um, more like Bob Dylan.

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:25.930
He started here, so
it's good enough for me.

01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:27.798
Oh, Dylan.

01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:29.900
The Ballad of Frankie Lee
and Judas Priest?

01:17:29.934 --> 01:17:31.468
That's right,
that's a great song.

01:17:32.836 --> 01:17:36.040
Well, right
this way, Ivy Wellman.

01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:37.741
Okay.

01:17:39.777 --> 01:17:42.246
Hey, by the way, what
apartment you're in?

01:17:42.279 --> 01:17:44.715
Uh, 7B.

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:45.916
We are neighbors then.

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:46.750
I'm in 7C!

01:17:46.784 --> 01:17:48.519
Oh, how about that!

01:17:48.552 --> 01:17:49.553
You need help
with your bag?

01:17:49.588 --> 01:17:50.955
No, no, that's okay.

01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:52.089
Thank you.

01:17:52.122 --> 01:17:54.659
Hey, you have plans
for dinner tonight?

01:17:54.693 --> 01:17:57.228
Um, no, I don't,
but that would be great,

01:17:57.261 --> 01:17:58.597
because I haven't had
a chance to pick up

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.130
any groceries yet.

01:18:00.164 --> 01:18:01.198
Great.

01:18:01.232 --> 01:18:02.667
And it's on me, of course.

01:18:02.701 --> 01:18:04.401
I made a killing on Bitcoins.

01:18:04.435 --> 01:18:06.203
Wow, even better.

01:18:06.237 --> 01:18:08.339
You are such a sweetheart,
Frankie Li!

01:18:08.372 --> 01:18:10.074
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:18:10.107 --> 01:18:12.476
Oh, and can you recommend
a good laundry service

01:18:12.509 --> 01:18:14.144
around here?

01:18:14.178 --> 01:18:15.446
Why you ask?

01:18:15.479 --> 01:18:16.981
Because I'm Chinese?

01:18:17.014 --> 01:18:17.948
Oh, no, no.

01:18:17.982 --> 01:18:18.782
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:18:18.816 --> 01:18:20.284
I... I didn't mean that.

01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:22.152
Um, sorry.

01:18:22.186 --> 01:18:23.622
Just kidding.

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.456
I know a place
and they deliver.

01:18:25.489 --> 01:18:27.124
Okay.

01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:07.197
Who the fuck are you?

01:19:07.231 --> 01:19:08.265
No, don't worry,
don't worry.

01:19:08.299 --> 01:19:09.967
You left your keys in
the door, that's all.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.336
I was visiting my girlfriend
down the hall,

01:19:12.369 --> 01:19:13.738
I saw the keys
in the door.

01:19:13.772 --> 01:19:15.774
I knocked, but
you didn't answer.

01:19:15.806 --> 01:19:17.074
So I thought
something was wrong.

01:19:17.107 --> 01:19:19.243
I was getting ready
to call the police.

01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:20.745
No, don't worry.

01:19:20.779 --> 01:19:22.346
You know and you shouldn't leave
your keys in the door.

01:19:22.379 --> 01:19:25.316
A girl can't be too careful
these days in the city.

01:19:25.349 --> 01:19:26.317
Don't worry.

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:27.585
I'm sorry.

01:19:27.619 --> 01:19:29.520
I'm so sorry.

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:46.671
The choice between
hell and happiness, Sarah,

01:19:46.705 --> 01:19:49.540
is entirely yours.

01:19:49.574 --> 01:19:50.874
Don't share yourself with
those that don't

01:19:50.908 --> 01:19:53.477
have your interests
at heart.

01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:55.814
Everything you make
has consequences,

01:19:55.846 --> 01:19:57.915
so develop a sense
of caution.

01:19:57.948 --> 01:20:00.719
Save yourself from the
pain that devours your spirit

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:03.053
and destroys your soul.

01:20:03.087 --> 01:20:04.955
But how?

01:20:04.988 --> 01:20:06.423
How do I do that?

01:20:06.457 --> 01:20:08.459
Don't take it anymore.

01:20:08.492 --> 01:20:11.862
You are a warrior.

01:21:35.081 --> 01:21:40.081
