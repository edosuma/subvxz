<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

00:02.705 --> 00:06.074
The shape-shifters...
on your side are looking for someone.

00:06.104 --> 00:08.840
William Bell told me that
Newton would try to open a doorway

00:08.870 --> 00:10.673
from our universe to the other side.

00:11.124 --> 00:13.088
You once built a door

00:13.118 --> 00:15.187
that let you walk between worlds.

00:15.217 --> 00:16.578
Tell me how you did it.

00:17.705 --> 00:19.635
- I can save him.
- Peter is dead.

00:19.665 --> 00:21.243
We're talking about the other Peter,

00:21.468 --> 00:22.856
the one on the other side.

00:23.931 --> 00:26.623
- You're not my father!
- Of course I am.

00:28.127 --> 00:30.520
I've done enough damage.
I have to tell him who he really is.

00:45.814 --> 00:48.083
You feel that?

00:48.151 --> 00:49.620
What?

00:49.688 --> 00:51.323
The... the shaking.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.193
A whole lot of shakin' goin' on.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.564
No, I'm serious.

00:55.632 --> 00:57.635
And you're stoned. Give me that.

01:00.574 --> 01:03.812
I thought you said this
place was abandoned.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.015
I'm gonna check it out.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.487
- We should just go.
- No, just hang tight.

01:07.556 --> 01:09.391
I'll be fine.

02:19.922 --> 02:22.857
What the hell?

03:16.019 --> 03:17.820
This totally sucks.

03:17.888 --> 03:19.155
What took you so long?

03:19.223 --> 03:20.390
You scared the hell out of me.

03:20.457 --> 03:22.359
I want to leave here, Dave.

03:54.384 --> 03:56.452
Oh, come on, Walter, not again.

03:56.519 --> 03:58.687
I'm just rearranging.

03:58.755 --> 04:01.190
Uh, it's not quite right yet.

04:01.257 --> 04:02.625
It's fine.

04:02.692 --> 04:05.695
And it was fine yesterday and
fine the day before that.

04:05.763 --> 04:07.597
A well-ordered house

04:07.665 --> 04:09.466
is the sign of a well-ordered mind.

04:09.534 --> 04:10.834
Yeah, but staying up all night

04:10.902 --> 04:12.970
to find the perfect place
for your laundry hamper

04:13.037 --> 04:14.871
is a sign of something else,
in my books.

04:17.139 --> 04:18.305
Come on, leave that for later.

04:18.373 --> 04:19.839
<i>I got you a surprise.</i>

04:19.906 --> 04:21.841
<i>I thought maybe we could
bake a pie together.</i>

04:21.908 --> 04:22.841
<i>Your favorite...</i>

04:22.909 --> 04:24.276
say, pecan?

04:24.344 --> 04:26.111
I got all the good stuff.

04:26.179 --> 04:30.248
You want to whip the batter?

04:30.315 --> 04:31.382
The batter can wait.

04:31.450 --> 04:33.917
There's something we
have to talk about.

04:33.985 --> 04:35.852
Okay, fair enough. It's your room.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.188
- You can decorate it however you like.
- It's not that.

04:39.256 --> 04:42.090
There's something
you deserve to know.

04:45.061 --> 04:47.061
Peter...

04:47.129 --> 04:50.064
Every living thing dies.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.900
As a scientist,

04:53.968 --> 04:57.136
that's one of the hardest
things to accept,

04:57.204 --> 04:59.672
That we try to understand

04:59.739 --> 05:01.040
the mechanisms of life.

05:01.107 --> 05:04.375
But inevitably, we can't defeat death.

05:04.443 --> 05:06.777
<i>No matter how much we may want to.</i>

05:09.947 --> 05:10.946
It's Olivia.

05:11.014 --> 05:13.315
Hey. What's up?

05:15.051 --> 05:16.984
Yeah.

05:17.052 --> 05:19.019
Yeah, sure. We'll meet you outside.

05:19.087 --> 05:20.554
Something happened?

05:20.621 --> 05:21.588
Yeah, I guess so.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.357
She's on her way to pick us up.

05:25.126 --> 05:27.094
I'll get my field kit.

05:27.162 --> 05:29.430
Walter...

05:29.497 --> 05:31.765
Oh, it's...
it's all right, Peter.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.133
It can wait.

05:40.606 --> 05:41.939
Name's Jill Redmond.

05:42.007 --> 05:44.074
Her purse was found
outside the car.

05:44.142 --> 05:46.309
Patrolman found her
with a broken neck.

05:46.377 --> 05:47.843
<i>That's the cause of death.</i>

05:47.911 --> 05:49.945
<i>But the medical examiner found this.</i>

05:50.013 --> 05:52.381
Three puncture wounds
in her soft palate.

05:52.448 --> 05:54.315
<i>Raised a red flag in the FBI database</i>

05:54.383 --> 05:55.983
<i>and came up the chain to me.</i>

05:56.051 --> 05:57.785
Shape-shifters.

05:57.852 --> 05:59.987
<i>Well, the last time we heard of
Newton and his men</i>

06:00.054 --> 06:01.588
<i>was in New York.</i>

06:01.656 --> 06:03.390
They must have needed her
identity for something.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.924
<i>What else do we know about her?</i>

06:04.992 --> 06:07.126
We're running a background
check on her now.

06:07.194 --> 06:08.460
<i>Well, we should send her photograph</i>

06:08.528 --> 06:10.462
to the local and
state law enforcement.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.796
And make sure they
know that she just got

06:11.864 --> 06:14.965
a hell of a lot more
dangerous than she looks.

06:15.033 --> 06:16.734
Look...

06:16.802 --> 06:18.803
It's a lemon zinger, I believe.

06:20.206 --> 06:22.606
Mm! It's not as good
as the stuff I grow,

06:22.674 --> 06:24.575
but it's not bad either.

06:24.642 --> 06:26.109
Well, at least she
died in a happy place.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.178
I'm not so sure.

06:28.245 --> 06:29.379
The girl's wearing lipstick,

06:29.446 --> 06:31.514
but there isn't any on the joint.

06:32.883 --> 06:34.816
So you think that maybe
she was with somebody?

06:34.884 --> 06:36.151
Maybe...

06:36.218 --> 06:39.320
Maybe someone who was
lucky enough to get away.

07:08.743 --> 07:12.513
Three puncture wounds
to the soft palate.

07:13.548 --> 07:14.648
<i>All clear.</i>

07:14.716 --> 07:16.016
<i>The rest of the place is deserted.</i>

07:16.084 --> 07:17.719
Except for this.

07:25.591 --> 07:28.325
Walter, have you seen
anything like this before?

07:28.393 --> 07:29.727
<i> I think I may have.</i>

07:29.795 --> 07:31.496
<i>It's awfully familiar.</i>

07:31.564 --> 07:33.031
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

07:33.099 --> 07:34.733
It reminds me of a beanbag chair

07:34.801 --> 07:36.268
I once owned...

07:36.336 --> 07:38.470
1974.

07:44.477 --> 07:47.250
So when a shape-shifter
takes a body,

07:47.317 --> 07:48.851
<i>it's because they want access,</i>

07:48.919 --> 07:51.887
like, uh, the one
that turned into the nurse,

07:51.955 --> 07:53.222
came after me at the hospital.

07:53.289 --> 07:55.557
Or... Charlie.

07:55.624 --> 07:58.660
<i>So what would the shape-shifters
want with these kids?</i>

07:59.627 --> 08:02.895
You think that's a good idea?

08:02.963 --> 08:05.630
Oh, yeah, I think
it's harmless enough.

08:20.010 --> 08:21.944
Mercury.

08:23.913 --> 08:25.547
Walter, if that's mercury,

08:25.614 --> 08:27.948
do you think that this
is a shape-shifter?

08:28.016 --> 08:29.749
I do believe it is.

08:34.321 --> 08:37.121
Isn't that wonderful?

08:50.115 --> 08:52.049
Good morning.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.117
We're here to pick up a camera,

08:54.184 --> 08:55.551
an Argus...

08:55.619 --> 08:57.786
A2B 35mm.

09:00.923 --> 09:04.259
The secretary told me there
would be three of you.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.727
There was a problem.

09:05.794 --> 09:08.495
The third didn't make it.

09:10.064 --> 09:12.031
Marvelous.

09:13.534 --> 09:14.901
That feels like an embryo,

09:14.968 --> 09:18.068
in the sense that it's
not fully developed.

09:18.136 --> 09:19.402
Developed?

09:19.470 --> 09:20.803
<i>Well, my theory is</i>

09:20.871 --> 09:24.105
that this is the state in
which they enter our universe.

09:24.173 --> 09:26.474
<i>And as I've said,
being partly mechanical,</i>

09:26.542 --> 09:29.277
<i>they can cross over in a
way that humans can't.</i>

09:29.344 --> 09:31.412
But, uh, this one...

09:31.479 --> 09:33.980
seems to have failed
to mature properly.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.184
Peter, would you take a look?

09:39.653 --> 09:42.587
Shape-shifter embryo.

09:42.655 --> 09:43.721
Adorable.

09:43.789 --> 09:46.056
So the two teenagers...

09:46.124 --> 09:47.324
maybe there were two more of these

09:47.392 --> 09:49.093
that hatched and killed them.

09:49.161 --> 09:54.165
It's a sound proposition, but
presumably the embryonic shape-shifters

09:54.232 --> 09:57.568
would have needed features,
human identities.

09:57.635 --> 10:00.137
They certainly wouldn't
blend in otherwise.

10:00.204 --> 10:02.939
So then those two teenagers were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

10:04.241 --> 10:05.574
Dunham.

10:05.642 --> 10:07.376
It's got dozens of
different amino acids,

10:07.443 --> 10:12.215
which would allow it to survive in the
foreign conditions of our universe.

10:12.283 --> 10:13.483
Okay, that was Broyles.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.851
Astrid, I want to see if we
can download this file

10:15.918 --> 10:17.485
from the FBI's secure server.

10:17.553 --> 10:19.553
The African elephant is the largest...

10:22.458 --> 10:24.158
Okay, this was recorded last night.

10:24.226 --> 10:26.760
Now just before 9:00 p.m.,
several dozen homes,

10:26.828 --> 10:29.230
all within a half-mile
radius of the warehouse,

10:29.298 --> 10:31.365
reported an... an
odd kind of interference

10:31.433 --> 10:33.100
with their broadcast signal.

10:33.168 --> 10:34.301
That's right around when the M.E.

10:34.369 --> 10:35.468
estimated the time of
death for those kids.

10:35.536 --> 10:36.769
Walter,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.771
is it possible that the
shape-shifter embryo

10:38.839 --> 10:40.539
could have caused this kind
of interference?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.007
Yes.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.543
I believe the interfering signal

10:44.610 --> 10:47.479
may have originated in
the alternate universe.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.648
We may be getting a glimpse
into the other side.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.117
- Can we turn it up?
- Yeah.

10:54.184 --> 10:55.785
And slow it down.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.591
What is that?

11:02.659 --> 11:04.961
It almost sounds like a language.

11:05.028 --> 11:07.797
You hear the way that some of
those sounds seem to repeat?

11:07.865 --> 11:09.499
Shape-shifters are soldiers.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.335
Soldiers always come with orders.

11:12.403 --> 11:14.103
Maybe that's a message.

11:14.171 --> 11:15.538
I can see what the code breakers

11:15.606 --> 11:17.105
at the bureau can make of it.

11:17.173 --> 11:19.374
I got a better idea.

11:21.076 --> 11:22.443
It's not a language.

11:22.511 --> 11:24.045
It's math.

11:24.113 --> 11:25.280
Math?

11:25.348 --> 11:27.282
Trigonometric equations...

11:27.350 --> 11:28.449
in this case, a radio wave,

11:28.517 --> 11:33.254
the kind given off by a solar flare,
which is interesting.

11:33.322 --> 11:35.256
Interesting how?

11:35.324 --> 11:40.093
Our astronomical division picked up a surge
in solar activity right around that time.

11:40.161 --> 11:43.296
Here's a radio wave from
last night's solar flare.

11:43.363 --> 11:46.197
Uh, here's your wave.

11:46.264 --> 11:48.166
But yours couldn't have
come from the sun.

11:48.234 --> 11:49.834
Well, where else
could it have come from?

11:49.901 --> 11:51.334
I don't know.

11:51.402 --> 11:54.536
I mean, they're not in sync.

11:54.604 --> 11:57.038
Suppose it came
from a parallel universe.

11:57.106 --> 11:59.573
Wow.

11:59.641 --> 12:01.139
That... that would de...

12:01.207 --> 12:04.042
yeah, yeah, because in
a parallel universe,

12:04.110 --> 12:06.344
time would be slightly out of sync.

12:06.412 --> 12:07.712
And the waves would be too.

12:11.149 --> 12:12.549
Hmm.

12:12.617 --> 12:15.719
What?

12:15.787 --> 12:21.091
Imagine that these are
the two universes...

12:25.063 --> 12:26.530
slightly out of sync.

12:28.032 --> 12:32.601
But on rare occasion,
they perfectly line up.

12:35.972 --> 12:40.041
According to the computer,
that's gonna happen

12:40.109 --> 12:44.444
between our universe and wherever
this radio wave came from.

12:44.512 --> 12:45.945
When?

12:46.013 --> 12:51.316
Based on this, tomorrow at
precisely 3:31 p.m.

12:55.553 --> 12:57.698
- All right, who will be McCallister?
- That'd be me.

12:58.123 --> 12:59.045
He's Wu.

13:04.127 --> 13:07.930
Now everything else you need is in here.

13:07.998 --> 13:09.965
Once you're done, we'll reconvene

13:10.033 --> 13:13.001
at the exchange points tomorrow
at exactly 20 past 3:00.

13:13.068 --> 13:15.036
So that's it?

13:15.104 --> 13:16.472
We're still going through with this?

13:16.539 --> 13:18.441
Why? You have a problem with this?

13:18.509 --> 13:19.742
We're a man down.

13:19.810 --> 13:22.612
Neither of us have time to handle
the Verona assignment,

13:22.680 --> 13:24.446
and you don't have a
shifting device.

13:24.514 --> 13:26.347
Maybe we should abort.

13:26.415 --> 13:28.449
And I suppose you'll be the one

13:28.517 --> 13:30.084
to give the news to the secretary.

13:30.151 --> 13:32.786
We won't have another chance
like this for seven months.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.855
So I'll figure out how
to handle Mr. Verona.

13:35.923 --> 13:38.124
You make sure you hold your end.

13:38.191 --> 13:41.260
All right?

13:41.327 --> 13:43.094
You're the boss.

13:43.162 --> 13:44.896
Then let's get to work.

14:00.700 --> 14:01.800
Excuse me...

14:02.029 --> 14:04.926
Would you happen to know
where Franklin Street is?

14:04.927 --> 14:05.960
Sure.

14:06.027 --> 14:09.835
Uh, you're three blocks south
of Franklin, so go down this street.

14:09.903 --> 14:11.373
You'll see a convenience store.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.846
Then make a left and go two blocks west.

14:15.913 --> 14:18.682
I'll write it down for you.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.728
Hey. Where's Walter?

14:30.795 --> 14:32.196
He's out counting cars.

14:32.263 --> 14:33.697
Thinks it might help jog his memory.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.733
He says that human memory
is best triggered...

14:35.800 --> 14:37.768
When accomplishing
mundane tasks, I know.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.002
Yeah, Walter's convinced

14:39.070 --> 14:41.772
that Newton wants to build
a door to the other side.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.373
If Walter can remember
what he told Newton,

14:43.441 --> 14:46.876
we might be able to figure out what's
supposed to happen at 3:31 tomorrow.

14:46.944 --> 14:48.277
And these cars that he's tracking down?

14:48.345 --> 14:51.046
Well, he promised
to stay off the freeway.

15:11.653 --> 15:12.585
Hey.

15:12.653 --> 15:13.685
Hey.

15:13.752 --> 15:15.017
How goes it?

15:15.085 --> 15:18.353
Uh, Broyles sent over a list
of state and local events

15:18.421 --> 15:20.889
taking place tomorrow, so...

15:24.460 --> 15:26.761
Uh-oh.

15:26.828 --> 15:28.896
Star Trek convention at the
Worcester Centrum.

15:28.963 --> 15:31.198
That's not good.
I told Walter I'd take him.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.400
Maybe we'll just pretend
like we didn't see that.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.168
Sure.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.274
I think I finally figured out why it is

15:43.342 --> 15:46.743
that Walter's been
acting so strange lately.

15:46.811 --> 15:49.044
He's been carrying this
picture around with him...

15:49.112 --> 15:52.847
a family photo from when I was a kid.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.918
I think he wants to talk to
me about how my mother died.

16:01.890 --> 16:03.792
About a month after I got to Europe,

16:03.860 --> 16:06.132
I got a call from St. Claire's...

16:06.200 --> 16:07.634
from Walter.

16:07.702 --> 16:09.869
He told me that she died in a car crash.

16:09.937 --> 16:12.872
It wasn't a car crash.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.375
My mother committed suicide.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.918
It was the only time I spoke to him

16:27.985 --> 16:31.120
in the 17 years that he was
locked up in St. Claire's.

16:33.823 --> 16:36.758
He must have known the truth.

16:36.825 --> 16:40.960
I think, in his way,
he was trying to protect me.

16:41.028 --> 16:43.762
And...

16:43.830 --> 16:47.465
And for whatever reason,
he wants to talk about it now.

16:50.501 --> 16:52.501
Peter...

16:54.804 --> 16:57.606
You know that Walter
loves you very much.

17:01.177 --> 17:02.811
Peter!

17:04.346 --> 17:05.746
Our synthetic friends.

17:05.814 --> 17:08.584
I believe I know how to
figure out what they're up to.

17:08.651 --> 17:09.917
You remember what you told Newton?

17:09.986 --> 17:12.186
No, but as they say in Finland...

17:12.255 --> 17:15.790
There's more than one
way to roast a reindeer.

17:15.858 --> 17:16.957
But I'll need some supplies.

17:17.025 --> 17:19.593
I need six car batteries,
a voltage transformer,

17:19.660 --> 17:23.462
and... and several yards of
ten-gauge electrical wire.

17:23.530 --> 17:25.164
Oh! Uh, and a corpse.

17:25.231 --> 17:26.665
Any corpse will do.

17:26.733 --> 17:29.902
But it shouldn't be dead
for more than two days.

17:35.641 --> 17:38.275
- Hello.
- Hello. Can I help you?

17:38.343 --> 17:41.112
Yes, I'm here to see your manager,
Mr. McCallister.

17:41.179 --> 17:43.447
He's... he's expecting me.

17:45.449 --> 17:48.517
So, boss, you felt the
need to check up on me?

17:48.585 --> 17:51.587
Yeah.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.322
Figure out what to do about Verona?

17:53.390 --> 17:55.458
I have some thoughts.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.146
Mr. McCallister?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.414
Yes?

18:36.482 --> 18:38.549
Approval for an overdraft withdrawal?

18:38.617 --> 18:39.683
Oh, thank you.

18:39.751 --> 18:40.784
I'll be there in just a minute.

18:40.851 --> 18:42.118
Okay.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.186
You can handle the rest.

18:48.254 --> 18:50.388
Just make sure the device
remains undisturbed.

18:52.991 --> 18:56.396
Tied into the house power,
and the voltmeter is ready to go.

18:56.464 --> 18:59.101
Uh, so, Walter, you're sure
that I'm doing this right?

18:59.169 --> 19:00.739
It's perfect, Olivia.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.809
Just make sure they're tightened down.

19:02.877 --> 19:05.212
Walter, you really think
that this is gonna work?

19:05.279 --> 19:06.713
There's no reason it shouldn't.

19:06.781 --> 19:08.948
I mean, something stopped this creature

19:09.016 --> 19:12.687
from developing, and because
it's part mechanical,

19:12.755 --> 19:14.590
if we pump it with enough electricity,

19:14.658 --> 19:18.460
we should be able to restart it,
like jump-starting a car.

19:18.528 --> 19:20.562
So what's the corpse for?

19:20.630 --> 19:23.431
Is this embryo supposed to reanimate it?

19:23.499 --> 19:25.099
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

19:25.167 --> 19:28.836
B... but, if we intend to
question this creature,

19:28.904 --> 19:32.072
then it will need an identity to...

19:32.139 --> 19:34.507
to shape-shift into.

19:34.575 --> 19:36.142
'Cause that's not ridiculous at all.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.977
I think we're ready, Olivia.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.179
80 amps.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.246
80 amps.

19:46.985 --> 19:50.186
Hmm, not enough power,
but it seems to be working.

19:50.254 --> 19:53.789
Uh, try 110.

19:53.857 --> 19:55.024
110.

20:02.498 --> 20:04.265
Walter...

20:04.333 --> 20:05.500
140.

20:07.736 --> 20:10.203
140.

20:13.140 --> 20:17.043
I think we must have blown a fuse.

20:17.111 --> 20:19.178
Oh, my.

20:19.246 --> 20:21.314
Look. Astrid, quickly... some candles.

21:04.314 --> 21:05.347
Something's wrong.

21:05.415 --> 21:10.616
When I cut into it,
I must have damaged it.

21:10.684 --> 21:12.151
Peter, the corpse.

21:21.092 --> 21:22.425
All right, good on my side.

21:30.834 --> 21:33.635
Help me.

21:35.805 --> 21:38.639
Contact... Newton.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.741
Thomas Jerome Newton?

21:41.809 --> 21:43.008
Where is he?

21:43.076 --> 21:44.876
Verona.

21:44.944 --> 21:47.645
D... D... Daniel...

21:47.712 --> 21:49.245
Verona.

21:49.313 --> 21:51.046
Wait, who is Daniel Verona?

21:51.113 --> 21:55.549
Blood type A.B. negative.

21:55.617 --> 21:58.752
Cellular polarity...

21:58.820 --> 22:01.121
- We're losing him.
- Okay, tomorrow afternoon,

22:01.189 --> 22:03.089
what is happening at 3:31?

22:11.596 --> 22:15.999
I'm... sorry.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.881
Daniel Verona?

22:46.949 --> 22:48.782
FBI.

22:51.819 --> 22:54.320
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

22:54.388 --> 22:55.388
Well, there's a man.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.056
He's middle-aged, Caucasian.

22:57.124 --> 22:59.391
It looks like he's
having a heart attack.

22:59.459 --> 23:00.692
<i>What is your location?</i>

23:00.760 --> 23:02.694
I'm on the corner of
Longwood and Huntington.

23:02.762 --> 23:04.596
<i>What is your name, sir?</i>

23:25.247 --> 23:26.514
Oh, my God!

23:26.581 --> 23:28.382
Hey, this... this guy needs help!

23:28.450 --> 23:30.284
Does anyone know CPR?

23:30.351 --> 23:33.019
Someone call an ambulance, quick!

23:40.862 --> 23:44.698
He's not a shape-shifter.

23:44.765 --> 23:48.901
We'll run his blood anyway,
test it for mercury.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.770
Maybe we got to him before they could.

23:50.838 --> 23:52.172
Why him?

23:52.240 --> 23:53.875
I mean, why Daniel Verona?

23:53.943 --> 23:57.478
What could they want with him?

23:57.546 --> 24:00.315
Medical examiner, works out
of Boston General...

24:01.850 --> 24:03.951
It's anybody's guess.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.934
Yeah, you too.

25:11.002 --> 25:12.669
Okay. Good night.

25:12.737 --> 25:14.237
Agent Dunham?

25:14.305 --> 25:15.972
Yeah. Verona was a bust.

25:21.210 --> 25:22.677
Walter...

25:22.745 --> 25:25.279
You've been awake for two straight days.

25:25.347 --> 25:26.547
You need to get some rest.

25:26.614 --> 25:28.815
Shape-shifters...

25:28.883 --> 25:33.252
I should have been more careful
with my initial dissection.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.254
If I hadn't caused so much damage,

25:35.322 --> 25:37.556
it would... it could
have told us everything.

25:37.624 --> 25:39.291
But you couldn't
possibly have known that.

25:39.359 --> 25:42.460
It was definitely
stupid and inexcusable.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.964
Calm down.

25:47.032 --> 25:48.666
It's gonna be okay.

25:48.733 --> 25:50.401
Okay, yeah.

25:50.468 --> 25:52.436
We're gonna figure it out,
just like we always do.

25:52.503 --> 25:53.904
Okay. Okay.

25:53.972 --> 25:56.606
- Okay?
- Hmm.

25:56.674 --> 25:59.676
I want you to get some rest, dad.

25:59.744 --> 26:00.810
I'm gonna hit the sack.

26:00.878 --> 26:02.878
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

26:02.946 --> 26:04.380
"Dad."

26:04.447 --> 26:05.914
Huh?

26:07.783 --> 26:09.850
You just called me dad.

26:14.554 --> 26:16.722
Yeah, I guess I did.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.224
Peter!

26:19.292 --> 26:20.758
Yeah?

26:20.826 --> 26:22.727
Newton...

26:22.795 --> 26:24.895
I think I know what he's planning to do.

26:27.898 --> 26:29.765
She's here.

26:29.833 --> 26:32.466
Agent Dunham, I'm...
I'm sorry to get you out of bed.

26:32.534 --> 26:35.069
Oh, it's okay. Okay. Now...

26:35.137 --> 26:38.372
Geometry and harmonic vibrations...

26:38.440 --> 26:41.441
that's how we did it, Belly and I.

26:41.509 --> 26:42.809
Did what?

26:42.877 --> 26:47.877
Sent Belly's Monte Carlo from
this universe to the other side.

26:47.944 --> 26:51.612
Now as I've said before, the two
universes vibrate at different frequencies.

26:51.679 --> 26:54.713
So we set up three harmonic rods

26:54.781 --> 26:59.717
arranged as an equilateral triangle
and then activated the rods.

27:04.819 --> 27:10.153
When the car began to vibrate
at just the right frequency...

27:12.990 --> 27:15.824
That's how we sent Belly's
car to the other side.

27:15.892 --> 27:17.859
And it's exactly what Newton
did with the building.

27:17.927 --> 27:19.227
But Newton's attempt failed.

27:19.295 --> 27:20.695
Yes, indeed it did,

27:20.763 --> 27:23.431
b... because the building
that Newton brought over

27:23.499 --> 27:27.000
landed in a location that was
already occupied by another.

27:27.068 --> 27:28.502
But I suspect that Mr. Newton

27:28.569 --> 27:29.736
has found a way around that problem,

27:29.804 --> 27:32.304
because he has something
that Belly and I never had.

27:32.372 --> 27:33.305
What's that?

27:33.372 --> 27:35.941
Agents in both universes.

27:36.009 --> 27:37.776
Yes, Peter.

27:37.844 --> 27:40.877
So if we set up the harmonic rods

27:40.945 --> 27:42.879
in exactly the same position

27:42.947 --> 27:46.314
in each universe, like so...

27:46.382 --> 27:49.450
And we activate the rods...

27:49.518 --> 27:50.751
Boom.

27:50.819 --> 28:00.022
Then whatever is in the center of each
triangle will simply be exchanged.

28:00.090 --> 28:04.225
Of course, that would likely require
that the universes be in sync.

28:04.293 --> 28:07.761
3:31 this afternoon.

28:07.829 --> 28:09.463
Okay, so, uh...

28:09.530 --> 28:11.131
so what could Newton bring here?

28:11.198 --> 28:15.334
Last time he brought a building, so I
suppose anything he could fit inside of it...

28:15.402 --> 28:16.802
a... a machine.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.168
- An army.
- Yes.

28:18.236 --> 28:20.770
If the triangle is large enough,
that is possible.

28:20.838 --> 28:22.305
Okay, so we have roughly ten hours

28:22.373 --> 28:25.207
to figure out where the center
of Newton's triangle is.

28:25.275 --> 28:27.008
Yes.

28:27.076 --> 28:28.810
But it could be anywhere.

28:50.407 --> 28:52.108
Three points...

28:52.175 --> 28:53.709
Newton would have to
place the harmonic rods

28:53.776 --> 28:56.177
at three specific
locations across the city.

28:56.245 --> 28:57.778
Okay, so that's why
Newton's going after Verona,

28:57.846 --> 29:00.383
because Verona must have access
to one of the three points.

29:00.451 --> 29:02.653
So that would suggest either
Boston General Hospital

29:02.721 --> 29:03.788
or Verona's home.

29:03.856 --> 29:06.091
Okay, so Verona lives in Beacon Hill...

29:06.159 --> 29:07.826
520 South Garden Street.

29:07.893 --> 29:08.960
It doesn't matter.

29:09.028 --> 29:10.261
It's only a couple
blocks from the hospital.

29:10.329 --> 29:13.031
So for our purposes,
that's our first point.

29:13.098 --> 29:14.699
I think I might be able to help.

29:14.767 --> 29:17.435
Boston P.D. just found a corpse
in Chestnut Hill Village.

29:17.502 --> 29:19.035
Three punctures to his soft palate.

29:19.103 --> 29:20.803
His name is Ben McCallister.

29:20.871 --> 29:23.305
He's a branch manager at
Pinewood Savings Bank.

29:23.372 --> 29:25.005
He was found just outside his office.

29:25.073 --> 29:27.273
Not easy to access a bank.

29:27.341 --> 29:28.942
Okay, 185 Mason Ave.

29:29.010 --> 29:30.244
Mason...

29:30.312 --> 29:33.513
Excellent. So that's our second point, and now
we have the first leg of our triangle.

29:33.581 --> 29:34.680
We've got more than that, son.

29:34.748 --> 29:36.548
We're looking for
an equilateral triangle,

29:36.616 --> 29:37.883
therefore, the third point...

29:37.951 --> 29:40.453
Can only be in one of two places, right.

29:46.392 --> 29:52.497
All right, so the third point is
either Arlington or... Cedar Grove.

29:52.565 --> 29:53.731
Well, try both.

29:53.799 --> 29:56.133
See what's in the
center of each triangle.

30:00.638 --> 30:04.373
It's either Hyde Park...

30:04.441 --> 30:06.041
or right on the Charles River.

30:06.109 --> 30:07.342
So he's got to be targeting Hyde Park.

30:07.410 --> 30:10.778
Is there a bridge on the Charles?

30:12.080 --> 30:14.047
Yeah, a condemned railway bridge.

30:14.115 --> 30:15.816
Why?

30:18.752 --> 30:23.722
Uh, the water would absorb any excess
energy caused by Newton's procedure,

30:23.789 --> 30:26.190
so he must be making the
exchange on the bridge.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.524
She's right, Peter.

30:29.893 --> 30:33.427
Uh, it's Dunham.
I think we have something.

30:47.338 --> 30:48.871
We're all set.

30:48.939 --> 30:50.606
- Any problems?
- All good.

30:54.710 --> 30:57.411
Go deal with it, now.

31:06.194 --> 31:08.095
<i>Are we sending anyone to look
for the harmonic rods?</i>

31:08.163 --> 31:11.298
Agents are on their way to the morgue
and McCallister's bank in Chestnut Hill.

31:11.366 --> 31:12.633
Boston P.D. have been deployed

31:12.701 --> 31:13.768
to the Andrews Avenue bridge.

31:13.835 --> 31:14.935
What's your status?

31:15.003 --> 31:16.437
We're a few minutes away.

31:16.504 --> 31:17.671
Whatever Newton's trying to bring over,

31:17.739 --> 31:19.205
Walter thinks he can stop it.

31:19.273 --> 31:21.040
<i>Okay, call me when you get there.</i>

31:21.108 --> 31:22.975
Walter, how is this thing gonna work?

31:23.043 --> 31:24.777
Vibrations are composed of shock waves,

31:24.845 --> 31:28.513
and like sound waves, they can
be nullified by their opposite...

31:28.581 --> 31:31.082
- right, like noise-canceling
headphones. - Precisely.

31:31.149 --> 31:34.318
The seismograph will pick up the
vibrations from Newton's device.

31:34.386 --> 31:38.220
The laptop will calculate its opposite
and transmit it to the pneumatic hammer.

31:38.288 --> 31:40.756
To send out vibrations that would
cancel out Newton's device.

31:40.824 --> 31:43.393
Of course, we have to
get the hammer as close

31:43.460 --> 31:46.829
to the center of the bridge as possible,
which might be dangerous.

31:46.896 --> 31:47.829
Dangerous how?

31:47.897 --> 31:52.834
The vibrational waves that Newton
will need to generate the intensity...

31:52.902 --> 31:53.836
devastating.

31:53.903 --> 31:55.037
What do you mean, "devastating"?

31:55.104 --> 31:57.506
I suspect it would tear a man apart.

32:16.989 --> 32:20.958
Walter, I need you to stay here and
finish putting that thing together, okay?

32:23.628 --> 32:26.462
Hey... we need to get on that bridge.

32:26.530 --> 32:28.997
I'm afraid that's not possible.

32:29.065 --> 32:32.333
Uh... I'm with the FBI.

32:32.401 --> 32:33.801
You're the boss.

32:33.869 --> 32:37.070
Let me just check with the sergeant.

32:43.342 --> 32:44.643
How did you know?

32:44.711 --> 32:46.712
A cop wouldn't call his
sergeant on a cell phone.

33:09.896 --> 33:11.763
Walter! No!

34:16.612 --> 34:18.446
It's 3:32.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.748
Walter's not gonna make it in time.

34:20.815 --> 34:23.083
I'm going up there. Cover me.

34:38.763 --> 34:39.763
Hey.

34:39.831 --> 34:41.498
Peter, you need to get off this bridge.

34:41.565 --> 34:42.831
I have to put this right.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.067
I started this, I've got to...

34:44.134 --> 34:46.333
It's gonna go faster
if we do it together.

35:05.053 --> 35:07.054
What?

35:07.088 --> 35:09.656
Yeah, the two on the bridge...
get them out of there.

35:20.932 --> 35:22.299
Peter and Walter are on the bridge.

35:22.366 --> 35:23.366
It's started.

35:25.670 --> 35:26.837
Pneumatic is ready.

35:26.904 --> 35:28.738
Seismograph is ready.

35:31.575 --> 35:32.876
Cleaning up the program!

35:35.879 --> 35:37.579
Something's wrong!

35:41.717 --> 35:43.751
I don't understand.
It should be working.

35:43.819 --> 35:46.353
There's something wrong with your
frequency-recognition program.

35:46.421 --> 35:48.088
But don't worry. I can fix it.

35:48.156 --> 35:50.090
How we doing?

35:50.157 --> 35:51.491
I need you all to get
off this bridge now.

35:51.559 --> 35:52.625
Get off the bridge.

35:52.693 --> 35:53.893
No, Walter, there's
nothing else you can do.

35:53.961 --> 35:55.360
I need you to get him off this bridge.

35:55.428 --> 35:56.995
Come on, Walter.

35:57.063 --> 35:58.963
- No, no. I... No, I... Olivia.
- Walter, come with me. Walter...

36:42.066 --> 36:44.033
Aah!

36:44.101 --> 36:45.267
You okay?

37:29.036 --> 37:30.703
Welcome back.

37:49.015 --> 37:50.548
How long was I out?

37:50.616 --> 37:54.118
Uh, about a day and a half.

37:54.186 --> 37:55.986
Here.

38:07.166 --> 38:09.267
The doctor said that you'd be fine,
but Walter was worried.

38:09.335 --> 38:12.737
I'm fine.

38:16.874 --> 38:18.343
Is he here?

38:18.410 --> 38:21.278
Yeah. He wouldn't leave.

38:21.346 --> 38:23.747
He'll want to know that you're up.

38:23.815 --> 38:25.916
Olivia...

38:27.785 --> 38:30.220
I'd like to speak to him alone,
if that's okay.

38:32.156 --> 38:33.757
Sure.

38:42.598 --> 38:44.166
Peter.

38:46.903 --> 38:51.673
Oh, they told me you'd be all right,
but I was so worried, son.

38:54.876 --> 38:57.177
And...

38:57.245 --> 38:59.412
There was another man on that bridge.

39:02.482 --> 39:06.918
When Newton's device started to work,
I saw him there...

39:06.986 --> 39:10.487
Just walking down the bridge.

39:10.555 --> 39:13.557
He had to have been from the other side.

39:15.993 --> 39:20.664
You said the effects of Newton's
vibrations would be devastating.

39:20.732 --> 39:23.166
And...

39:23.234 --> 39:24.400
They were.

39:24.467 --> 39:26.234
They destroyed that FBI agent.

39:26.302 --> 39:28.536
They just...

39:28.604 --> 39:32.239
disintegrated him like
he wasn't even there.

39:35.243 --> 39:38.578
But they didn't kill the
man from the other side.

39:40.581 --> 39:41.981
And they didn't kill me.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.594
I'm not from here, am I?

39:58.298 --> 40:03.368
You didn't just open up a
hole to the other side.

40:03.436 --> 40:06.004
You went through...

40:06.072 --> 40:07.940
and you brought me back.

40:09.943 --> 40:12.544
That's why I was able to
survive Newton's device.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.446
It's why I can't remember my childhood.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.847
You were dying, Peter...

40:16.915 --> 40:19.116
It's why my mother committed suicide.

40:20.585 --> 40:21.885
Isn't it?

40:21.953 --> 40:24.020
She knew...

40:24.088 --> 40:26.388
Didn't she?

40:26.456 --> 40:31.026
And when I left, the guilt was
too much for her to live with...

40:31.094 --> 40:33.629
the lie.

40:35.732 --> 40:37.198
Peter, you need to understand something.

40:37.266 --> 40:39.400
I understand, Walter.

40:41.903 --> 40:44.906
I understand everything now.

40:47.409 --> 40:48.376
Son...

40:48.444 --> 40:50.379
I am not your son.

40:57.486 --> 41:00.520
I'd like to be alone now.

41:39.625 --> 41:43.694
Uh, it... it would be easier if you
don't try to talk just yet, Mr. Secretary.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.796
You see, despite the preparation,

41:45.864 --> 41:48.499
crossing over is quite
an ordeal on your body,

41:48.566 --> 41:52.436
and, uh, the consequences
are unpredictable.

41:52.503 --> 41:55.172
This... this should help.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.542
You should...

42:01.610 --> 42:03.744
you should be able to sleep for a while.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.947
And hopefully, when you wake up,
you'll be stabilized.

42:27.032 --> 42:28.965
Walter, it's 6:00.

42:29.033 --> 42:31.032
Peter's probably still sleeping.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.700
I have to go to the hospital now.

42:32.768 --> 42:35.235
Are you going to drive me,
or shall I call a cab?

42:42.108 --> 42:43.876
Hey.

42:46.845 --> 42:48.279
Walter...

42:55.620 --> 42:58.588
Peter checked himself out of
the hospital three hours ago.

43:00.457 --> 43:05.727
He isn't at the lab, and he's
not answering his phone.

43:09.331 --> 43:10.864
He's gone.
