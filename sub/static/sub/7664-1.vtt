01:13.782 --> 01:19.287
20 million years ago,
an ape-like creature inhabited the Earth.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.938
And the ape stood, and became man.

02:53.632 --> 02:59.637
The greatest calamity that could befall
early man was the loss of fire.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.432
Fire, the mysterious phenomenon
that cooked his food,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.769
heated his cave, and kept him alive.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.732
If he could not start a fire,
he and his would surely die.

03:32.254 --> 03:38.551
Even in most primitive man,
the need to create was part of his nature.

03:38.719 --> 03:44.140
This need, this talent,
clearly separated early man from animals

03:44.308 --> 03:46.976
who would never know this gift.

03:50.355 --> 03:54.233
And here, in a cave somewhere
in the North American continent,

03:54.401 --> 03:56.736
about two million years ago,

03:56.904 --> 03:59.155
the first artist was born.

04:15.839 --> 04:20.176
And, of course,
with the birth of the artist,

04:20.344 --> 04:23.554
came the inevitable afterbirth.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.432
The critic.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.910
In the year one million BC,

04:46.078 --> 04:50.873
it is thought the first
Homo sapien marriage occurred.

04:59.216 --> 05:04.303
It was shortly followed
by the first homosexual marriage.

05:08.225 --> 05:13.938
One of the first weapons
man invented was the spear.

05:55.313 --> 06:00.359
In ancient times, man was ignorant
as to the cause and nature of death.

06:00.527 --> 06:05.072
So death was greeted
with a certain degree of awe.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.165
But because man did not have
the time for complicated rituals,

06:14.332 --> 06:18.085
funeral services were often brief.

06:25.969 --> 06:31.974
Even in early man, the need to laugh
was vital for emotional survival.

07:04.049 --> 07:09.345
Music began long before it was formalized
into notes and phrases.

07:09.513 --> 07:13.099
For mankind, it began with an accident.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.518
Gunga heard the sound and liked it.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.855
Gunga begged Gowie to repeat
the beautiful scream, but Gowie could not.

07:20.023 --> 07:25.361
So Gunga thought and thought,
and finally he found the answer.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.469
And so, music was born.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.056
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

07:54.224 --> 07:55.975
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

07:56.143 --> 08:01.647
Hallelujah!

08:06.987 --> 08:11.532
Moses went to the mountain,
and God spoke unto him.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.787
Moses, this is the Lord, thy God,

08:16.955 --> 08:21.750
commanding you to obey my law.
Do you hear me?

08:21.918 --> 08:26.463
Yes, I hear you. I hear you.
A deaf man could hear you.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.466
- What?
- Nothing. Gornisht. Forget it.

08:29.634 --> 08:34.471
O Lord, why have you chosen me?
What would you have me do for you?

08:34.639 --> 08:40.269
I shall give you my laws,
and you shall take them unto the people.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.687
Yes, Lord.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.733
Wow.

08:50.906 --> 08:55.951
Lord, I shall give these laws
unto thy people.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.246
Hear me, O hear me!

08:59.414 --> 09:01.207
All pay heed.

09:01.374 --> 09:06.837
The Lord, the Lord Jehovah,
has given unto you these fifteen...

09:10.258 --> 09:14.887
Ten! Ten commandments, for all to obey.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.898
Rome! Vortex of modern civilization.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.026
Rome! Fountainhead of culture.

09:29.194 --> 09:34.406
Rome! Blazing pronouncement
of mankind's most glorious achievements.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.081
All right, now. Columns! Columns!

09:42.249 --> 09:45.125
Columns! Columns! Get your columns here.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.836
Ionic, Doric, Corinthian.

09:48.004 --> 09:52.091
Put a few columns out in front,
turn any hovel into a showplace.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.177
Columns! Sir, don't touch the merchandise.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.179
All right, now. Columns! Columns!

09:57.347 --> 10:00.182
Haircut, shave, shampoo, bloodletting?

10:00.350 --> 10:03.269
Sooth! Soothsaying!
Get your sooth said right here.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.271
I can tell the future.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.399
You, sir!
For a wee fee of two drachmas,

10:08.566 --> 10:12.069
I can tell you your future.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.531
Yes, yes, I see... I see...

10:15.699 --> 10:19.368
I see that you are going on a long journey.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.869
Yes.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.580
You, sir, are going to Rome.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.167
- But I am in Rome.
- Do I lie?

10:28.545 --> 10:32.298
Sooth, sooth! We give great sooth!

10:33.008 --> 10:35.467
Chariots! Used chariots!

10:35.635 --> 10:37.511
Low mileage. They're great.

10:54.612 --> 10:59.908
I'm very excited about it.
It's a new concept. It's called a centerfold.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.329
Plumbing! Plumbing!

11:04.372 --> 11:08.542
Plumbing here, plumbing.
Yes, citizens, plumbing.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.253
It's the latest invention to hit Rome.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.757
It moves water from one place to another.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.760
It's astounding. It's amazing.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.054
Get on the bandwagon.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.098
Pipe the shit right out of your house.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.142
Plumbing! Plumbing here.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.020
Plumbing! Brand new invention!

11:36.112 --> 11:38.489
- Occupation?
- Gladiator.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.034
- Did you kill last week?
- No.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.996
- Did you try to kill last week?
- Yeah.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.374
This is your last week on insurance.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.960
Either you kill next week,
or we have to change your status.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.129
- Yeah.
- OK. Sign here.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.304
Next. Occupation?

12:02.472 --> 12:05.349
- Stand-up philosopher.
- What?

12:05.517 --> 12:07.559
Stand-up philosopher.

12:07.727 --> 12:14.149
I coalesce the vapor of human experience
into a viable and logical comprehension.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.277
Oh. A bullshit artist.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.281
Did you bullshit last week?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.991
No.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.078
Did you try to bullshit last week?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.663
Yes.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.290
Comicus! Comicus, Comicus!

12:31.876 --> 12:36.338
- Back in the line.
- He's not in line. He's my agent, Swiftus.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.966
Good news. I just got you a job.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.845
- Now you're working, you won't need this.
- Wait! That's mine.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.681
I'm sorry, I'm on my wine break.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.272
Dopus! I only had the money in my hand.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.691
Oh, I like that. I like that.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.986
I go and bust my anus to get you a job
and you're angry with me?

12:59.154 --> 13:03.115
Boy, you are nuts. N-V-T-S, nuts.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.702
- OK, OK. What kind of a job is it?
- Just the best gig in all Rome.

13:06.870 --> 13:10.998
A date every stand-up philosopher,
including Socrates, would die for.

13:11.166 --> 13:16.128
Believe it or not,
you are gonna play Caesar's palace.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.922
- The main room?
- The main room!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.216
Groovus!

13:21.384 --> 13:24.720
- Come on, the show starts in an hour.
- The main room!

13:24.888 --> 13:26.221
The main room!

13:26.389 --> 13:27.556
10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10...

13:27.724 --> 13:28.765
20, 20, 20, 20...

13:28.933 --> 13:29.975
30, 30, 30, 30, 30...

13:30.143 --> 13:32.144
40, 40, 40, 40, 40...
Do I hear 50?

13:32.312 --> 13:36.315
- 50!
- 50! Sold to the Venetian for 50 libra.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.817
- Oh, no. No! No!
- Come here, you.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.111
The slave auction is over.

13:41.279 --> 13:45.449
All right, take these rejects over to
the Colosseum, sell 'em for lion bait.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.119
- No!
- Wait a minute! Wait! Wait a minute.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.039
What is this with lions?
I can't go to the lions.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.208
I cannot go to the lions.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.920
Oh, no. 'Cause I happen to know
that the lions only eat Christians.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.256
Christians. And I am a Jew.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.551
Jewish person. Yes.
I can prove it. Watch. Look out.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.017
Everybody!

14:15.980 --> 14:19.733
- No! Hold it.
- Listen, I'm Jewish, I'm telling you.

14:19.901 --> 14:23.612
Call the temple. Call the rabbi.
Call Sammus Davis Jr.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.658
Call Sammus. He'll vouch for me.
He and I are tight. He knows...

14:27.825 --> 14:30.285
Jewish, huh?

14:30.453 --> 14:35.123
He missed. I jumped, and he missed. It was
his first day on the job, he was nervous.

14:35.291 --> 14:39.962
I got an appointment for Thursday. 11
o'clock, I go in, they give me a local, boom!

14:40.129 --> 14:44.258
- Get him out of here.
- You could make a lot of money with me.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.426
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Money?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.512
Come here.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.474
- How?
- I'm entertaining. I got special talents.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.769
I'll show you. Look out.
Sand. I gotta have a little sand.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.021
- What?
- Sand. You're standing on it.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.650
Sand. Give him the sand.
What the hell's the matter with you?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.319
- Here.
- Thank you.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.612
Yes.

15:05.780 --> 15:11.285
A little sand on the stage
for the native shim-sham sand dance.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.662
Look out. I'm gonna start.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.677
Born to do it.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.932
Hey, what country are you from?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.184
Ethiopia.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.395
What part?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.440
1 25th Street.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.027
I'm gonna sign him up.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.030
The big turn.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.868
And that's the Ethiopian shim-sham.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.329
He's good. He's great.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.874
What's wrong with you?
He's good. That guy is good.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.835
Hey, that kid is wonderful...

16:03.296 --> 16:04.546
Holy shit!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.882
Come on, get up.
You're costing me money.

16:10.345 --> 16:14.222
Please, stop it!
Can't you see the poor thing's in pain?

16:14.390 --> 16:16.850
Outta the way, or you'll get the same.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.310
No, you mustn't...

16:18.478 --> 16:21.438
Hey, hey, hey! What, are you crazy?

16:24.901 --> 16:27.903
Oh! Whoa.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.325
- Give it a little shot. Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.412
He was beating that poor exhausted horse.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.914
Oh, gee.

16:39.749 --> 16:43.043
Oh, he's not exhausted.
Here's the problem.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.837
See?

16:46.381 --> 16:50.092
Come on, boy.
You can get up. Come on, fella.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.437
Wait a minute. I know this horse.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.982
He used to be the fastest horse
in the Circus Maximus.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.069
His name is Miracle.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.571
Miracle? Oh, what a beautiful name.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.866
What's yours?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.285
Miracle... Comicus.

17:17.453 --> 17:22.499
- I'm a stand-up philosopher.
- Oh. I'm Miriam. I'm a vestal virgin.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.002
I'm really sorry to hear that.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.922
- I work at the palace.
- We're gonna be there.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.924
- Really?
- Look out!

17:31.092 --> 17:33.093
Whack!

17:34.220 --> 17:36.221
Wow.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.807
Put it there, pal. Man, you saved my life.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.518
Comicus, stand-up philosopher.
Who are you?

17:41.686 --> 17:44.563
I'm Josephus.
I'm the main course at the Colosseum.

17:44.731 --> 17:49.359
The main course... Say hello to some friends
of mine. My agent, Swiftus Lazarus.

17:49.527 --> 17:53.363
- You're good, man.
- And this is Miriam. She's a vestal virgin.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.323
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.160
- Seize him!
- Oh, seize this, honkus.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.579
No, don't ever say that to the cops!

18:00.747 --> 18:05.876
Seize him! Do you know the punishment
for a slave who strikes a Roman citizen?

18:06.043 --> 18:10.172
- I do!
- OK. You. You had your hand up first.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.175
- Death by torture.
- No. You?

18:13.342 --> 18:16.178
- Crucifixion.
- Wrong. You?

18:16.345 --> 18:19.806
They shove a living snake up your ass.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.225
No, but that's very creative.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.187
- You?
- They send you to the lions.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.189
- Right.
- No!

18:27.356 --> 18:30.025
What? He was right.
They send you to the lions.

18:33.571 --> 18:37.199
The empress! It's the empress!

18:37.366 --> 18:40.368
Move that miserable piece of shit!

18:56.177 --> 18:58.094
Halt!

18:58.262 --> 18:59.554
Stop.

18:59.722 --> 19:06.478
Could you please step on
the same foot at the same time?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.689
My tits are falling off.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.692
- Empress Nympho! Empress Nympho!
- Miriam?

19:12.860 --> 19:13.944
What are you doing here?

19:14.111 --> 19:17.614
VVs are not allowed outside
the palace without an escort.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.243
Empress, this man saved our lives.
Now they want to kill him.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.830
- We need your help.
- The white guy or the colored guy?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.790
The color... The slave.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.085
Please spare his life. I beg you.

19:30.253 --> 19:33.880
Perhaps you can use him at the palace.
He's truly gifted.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.132
Gifted?

19:36.300 --> 19:39.094
- Bob?
- Yes, Your Highness?

19:39.262 --> 19:44.266
Oh, Bob, do I have any openings
that this man might fit?

19:47.603 --> 19:52.107
- We could use another wine steward.
- I got a great corkscrew.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.694
- This is a hip crowd.
- Oh, I'll say.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.989
All right. Well, schlep him along.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.450
For the time being,
we will use him as a litter bearer.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.787
Oh, thank you, Your Highness. Oh, good!

20:05.955 --> 20:07.998
Good work, good work.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.043
Litter bearers, prepare to move.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.380
Litter bearers, harch!

20:21.262 --> 20:23.471
- See you at the palace.
- Bye.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.181
Goodbye.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.058
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.395
- Come on. We gotta go.
- We really have to go. See you later.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.022
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.885
All hail Caesar, emperor of Rome,

21:02.053 --> 21:05.931
monarch of the Roman Empire,
ruler of the world.

21:06.098 --> 21:10.060
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar!

21:10.227 --> 21:14.230
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar!

21:51.727 --> 21:55.397
All hail the commander
of His Majesty's Roman legions,

21:55.564 --> 21:59.401
the brave and noble Marcus Vindictus,

21:59.568 --> 22:05.824
who returns to Rome after winning
a great victory over the Cretins at Sparta.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.328
Make that the Spartans at Crete.

22:15.084 --> 22:18.920
Remember, thou art mortal.
Remember, thou art mortal.

22:19.088 --> 22:23.174
Remember, thou art mortal.
Remember, thou art mortal.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.301
Oh, blow it out your ass.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.846
O Caesar.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.934
I have brought your name
before the four corners of the Earth.

22:33.102 --> 22:37.105
I have subdued and conquered
the barbaric hordes in the name of Rome.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.357
I've penetrated into the farthest...

22:39.525 --> 22:41.776
What's under the sheet?

22:41.944 --> 22:42.944
- Sheet?
- Sheet!

22:43.112 --> 22:45.030
Sheet? Oh! Oh, the sheet. Yes.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.282
To begin with, number one,

22:47.450 --> 22:52.120
a beautiful hand-carved
alabaster bathing vessel.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.374
Nice. Nice.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.877
Not thrilling, but nice.

23:00.004 --> 23:05.884
Aha! But to fill the tub,
behind curtain number two,

23:06.052 --> 23:08.595
treasure from the Orient!

23:13.851 --> 23:16.144
Treasure. Bathtub.

23:17.146 --> 23:21.191
Treasure bath.
I'm going to have a treasure bath!

23:21.358 --> 23:23.735
Treasure bath!

23:23.903 --> 23:26.196
Treasure bath!

23:30.826 --> 23:32.952
Do it! Do it to me!

23:40.002 --> 23:45.298
Oh, Nympho. I would do anything, anything,
if you would only grant me your favors.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.343
How can I entice you?
How can I ensnare you?

23:48.511 --> 23:51.179
What bait must I use to catch your love?

23:51.347 --> 23:53.389
I am your servant.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.895
But the servant waits
while the master baits.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.356
Ye...

24:09.657 --> 24:11.825
Here, wash this.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.410
Yes, sire.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.582
The muse is upon me.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.377
Thank you, Caesar.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.879
All be quiet.

24:25.047 --> 24:29.551
His divine immortality has consented
to favor us with a new poem.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.678
Speak.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.973
O glorious Caesar. Speak.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.058
- You faggot.
- Yes, sire. Thank you.

24:37.226 --> 24:40.520
- Bring me a small lyre.
- A small lyre. Small lyre.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.981
I didn't do it. I wasn't even there.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.900
I was at a friend's house.
Check's in the mail.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.028
Not that kind of liar. Take him back out!

24:49.196 --> 24:51.156
- What?
- Take him out of here!

24:51.323 --> 24:53.408
Get him out. Take him out.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.035
Miriam, wine.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.955
Josephus, wine.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.253
Say when.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.505
8:30.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.180
It's so lonely at the top of Olympus.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.225
More women! More wine!

25:19.393 --> 25:21.436
More...

25:25.316 --> 25:27.901
OK, faggot. What's next?

25:28.485 --> 25:32.280
Comicus, the new
stand-up philosopher from Vesuvius.

25:32.448 --> 25:35.575
Good. I like a mountain comic.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.369
Comicus, you're on.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.005
Good evening, ladies and emperors.

25:49.173 --> 25:54.135
I just got back from Venice,
and boy, are my arms tired.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.973
Let me tell you about Venice.
Venice is a very old city.

25:59.141 --> 26:02.310
Wonderful, ancient city.
You can learn a lot in Venice.

26:02.478 --> 26:07.190
You want to know how to make
a Venetian blind? Like this.

26:09.902 --> 26:14.906
Have you heard about this new sect,
the Christians? They are a laugh riot.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.492
First of all, they are so poor...

26:17.660 --> 26:20.411
- How poor are they?
- Thank you.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.999
They are so poor
that they have only one god.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.674
Romans are rich.
We got a god for everything.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.177
Only thing we don't have a god for
is premature ejaculation.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.931
But I hear that that's coming quickly.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.519
The little fag gets it.

26:44.687 --> 26:45.853
Terrific, terrific.

26:46.021 --> 26:49.190
Let's face it, let's face it.
What's the rage today?

26:49.358 --> 26:52.485
Losing weight is all the rage.
Everybody in Rome

26:52.653 --> 26:54.862
is either in a steam room or a vomitorium.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.616
I mean, half of Rome
is either cooking or puking.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.743
"Cooking or puking"!

27:01.704 --> 27:06.165
But you can't blame these people. You can't
blame people for wanting to be thin.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.627
Who wants to look like a big fat pig?

27:12.047 --> 27:14.048
Did he say "big fat pig"?

27:14.216 --> 27:16.592
- Yes, he did, sire.
- Do you think he meant me?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.803
I believe he did, sire.

27:19.805 --> 27:23.057
Get off the fat jokes! Get off fat!
Get off fat!

27:23.225 --> 27:25.435
Fat, off... No...

27:26.937 --> 27:30.898
There's two Jews got off... No.
Syrian...

27:32.735 --> 27:35.903
Politics, politics, politics, politics, politics.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.114
Yes. The Roman Senate.

27:38.282 --> 27:43.578
The Roman Senate
is the best legislature that money can buy.

27:43.746 --> 27:47.415
It starts with the peddlers.
They bribe an assemblyman,

27:47.583 --> 27:49.667
who bribes a councilman,
who bribes a senator...

27:49.835 --> 27:53.421
It goes all the way up to the emperor!

27:54.256 --> 27:55.840
Shit!

27:58.761 --> 28:00.428
Kill him.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.057
Taxi? Hey, no autographs, no autographs.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.266
Seize him!

28:05.726 --> 28:06.934
Seize him!

28:08.103 --> 28:10.772
- More wine.
- More wine, more wine.

28:12.566 --> 28:18.571
Boy. When you die at the palace,
you really die at the palace.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.453
Whoops.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.916
Kill him. Kill him, too.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.126
Please, Empress. Save them.

28:38.050 --> 28:42.845
Wait. I've just had a wonderful idea.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.972
What was my idea?

28:45.974 --> 28:52.897
Oh, yes. Let these two fools fight
each other to the death during dessert.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.242
We who are about to...

29:05.327 --> 29:07.662
die, salute you.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.873
Salute.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.837
Hey, all right, all right. I'm sorry.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.506
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.716
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.097
I never killed another
human being in my life.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.684
But you gotta start sometime!

29:31.061 --> 29:32.645
Maniac.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.897
Wait... Watch it... Wait!

29:35.065 --> 29:37.525
- What?
- Isn't that Lena Horne over there?

29:45.200 --> 29:50.037
O Emperor, spare this poor man. He has
fought so bravely for your amusement.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.249
Let him...

29:55.335 --> 29:57.336
die.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.550
Tough shit.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.772
I can't do it.
Here, take the shield. Take the sword.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.317
- Come on, we'll fight our way out.
- Guards!

30:19.485 --> 30:21.068
Destroy them.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.744
You're the first white person
I even considered liking.

30:29.912 --> 30:30.912
Get outta here.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.837
Oh, the tide is turning.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.343
In the name of Caesar, halt!

30:45.511 --> 30:47.261
The rope.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.267
No! Goddammit, your hands are cold.

30:55.562 --> 31:00.107
Find them. Capture them. Kill them.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.695
- Wash this.
- Oh, yes, sire.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.203
Oh, it's you.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.747
This way, men.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.660
All right, forget that shit.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.328
I almost fell.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.417
Virgins, fall out.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.421
Competence.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.008
O Competence, tell me.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.678
What will happen to those two rogues
when they are caught?

32:10.846 --> 32:13.681
If they're captured, they're hung.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.434
Not necessarily.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.145
Whoo, girls.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.653
- Where are you leading me?
- The reviewing stand.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.364
To choose your escorts
for the midnight orgy.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.657
I had almost forgot.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.162
- Send them in.
- Left flank, harch.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.418
Arms rest.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.548
A very nice selection.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.177
I'm gonna start on this end.

32:55.015 --> 32:58.976
Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no

32:59.144 --> 33:01.687
Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no

33:01.855 --> 33:03.731
Yes, no, no, yes

33:03.899 --> 33:07.318
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

33:07.486 --> 33:09.945
Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no

33:10.113 --> 33:12.490
Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no

33:12.658 --> 33:15.242
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

33:15.410 --> 33:16.869
No, no, no, no...

33:17.037 --> 33:18.412
Wait a minute...

33:19.164 --> 33:23.584
Yes!

33:23.752 --> 33:25.711
Olé!

33:27.130 --> 33:30.591
- Very good. That'll be all.
- Quick-time harch!

33:37.432 --> 33:39.809
I love quick-time harch.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.605
- Where are we?
- Don't worry.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.406
Who's that?

33:56.952 --> 33:59.954
Quick, hide behind the drape.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.084
I liked your choices.
You made some very big decisions.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.044
Thank you.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.715
Search the area.
They can't have gotten far.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.091
Halt!

34:13.802 --> 34:18.013
All right, virgins.
Put on your "No Entry" signs.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.812
We are about to confront guys.

34:31.110 --> 34:35.822
How dare you? No man
may search the empress' quarters.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.824
As you wish.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.119
- You're beautiful when you...
- Shove it.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.500
Speak up, Mucus.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.377
Eunuch.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.422
- Ca-ca.
- What?

34:51.840 --> 34:55.926
That slave over there.
He looks rather puny.

34:57.679 --> 35:01.515
Is it not true when eunuchs are castrated,
they become enormous?

35:02.184 --> 35:06.771
It's Josephus, your wine steward.
Please help him.

35:10.025 --> 35:13.527
You have to give him some time.
He has just been snipped.

35:16.114 --> 35:22.244
If he is truly a eunuch like the others,
there would be no harm to take the test.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.497
- Test?
- Test?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.415
Test?

35:30.545 --> 35:31.962
Test.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.883
Eunuchs, come down here.

35:36.885 --> 35:43.432
Let us have Caladonia do her
highly erotic temple dance in praise of Eros.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.937
And if all these creatures
are indeed eunuchs...

35:50.565 --> 35:55.236
then nothing should arise. Get it?

35:56.863 --> 35:59.406
Caladonia! Caladonia!

35:59.574 --> 36:01.909
Let's make their big heads so hard.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.605
- He is a eunuch.
- Yeah.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.744
He is a eunuch.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.135
He's dead.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.646
He'll never survive.

37:26.328 --> 37:29.997
- The jig is up.
- And gone.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.792
- After him!
- Go on, men, get him.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.171
Quick. Back through the corridor.

37:37.339 --> 37:41.216
He's heading for the Senate. We can
meet him near the cloak room. Come on.

38:00.070 --> 38:03.030
In factorum, quid pro quo.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.075
In pecunium, sic transit gloria.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.494
I didn't know Gloria was sick.

38:09.037 --> 38:12.706
- Where is he?
- Don't worry, he has to come this way.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.834
- He should be here.
- The Senate is in session.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.044
Senate.

38:17.212 --> 38:20.631
O fellow members
of the Roman Senate, hear me.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.677
Shall we continue to build
palace after palace for the rich?

38:24.844 --> 38:31.392
Or shall we aspire to a more noble purpose
and build decent housing for the poor?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.185
How does the Senate vote?

38:34.688 --> 38:38.148
- Fuck the poor!
- Good.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.238
Joe!

38:44.406 --> 38:47.282
The man was dead
when I got there, I swear.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.743
What's the matter?
Where've you been? Who was dead?

38:49.911 --> 38:52.079
Never mind. How do we get out of here?

38:52.247 --> 38:54.039
- Here, put this on.
- All right.

38:54.207 --> 38:58.961
OK. I'm gonna find Swiftus, then I'll meet
you at the theater across from the baths.

38:59.129 --> 39:01.380
- The theater across from the baths.
- Right.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.507
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.426
- Stop with the goodbyes.
- OK.

39:05.593 --> 39:09.972
One more thing. Wait!
If we do escape, will you come with us?

39:10.140 --> 39:12.307
- Of course.
- Of course.

39:12.475 --> 39:17.938
Of course. Goodbye. Of course. Of course!
She's coming with us...

39:18.106 --> 39:19.606
- Come on.
- OK.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.443
Let's follow these senators.
Put your hood up.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.821
Behind these guys. Here we go.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.198
Ah, bullshit, bullshit.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.381
Give to Oedipus.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.969
Give to Oedipus.

39:49.512 --> 39:53.307
- Hey, Josephus.
- Hey, motherfucker.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.752
They should have been here
over 30 grains ago.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.674
- What could be keeping them?
- I don't know.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.470
There they are. Come on.

40:31.638 --> 40:35.182
Come on. Now, hurry. Walk this way.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.278
Hurry, get into these Trojan costumes.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.493
Che faccia da homma da left,
che faccia da homma da right.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.454
Che faccia da homma da,
che faccia da homma da,

40:57.622 --> 40:58.705
let's fight!

41:00.166 --> 41:02.543
Relax. Casual. Casual.

41:02.710 --> 41:07.339
No matter what happens, don't panic.
Don't panic.

41:07.507 --> 41:11.051
Che faccia da homma da left,
che faccia da homma da right.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.887
- Che faccia da homma...
- There they are!

41:14.055 --> 41:15.848
Panic!

41:17.684 --> 41:21.019
Che faccia da homma da left,
che faccia da homma da right...

41:24.899 --> 41:26.775
Captain Mucus, let's get after them.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.278
You take the left flank,
I'll take the right flank.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.573
Don't you know left flank from right?

41:32.740 --> 41:35.951
- I'm sorry, sir. I flunked flank.
- You flunked flank?

41:36.119 --> 41:38.912
Get the flunk out of here. Men!

41:43.918 --> 41:45.419
Here, this way.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.179
- Chemist, can you help me?
- What are you looking for?

41:55.346 --> 41:58.348
- A pack of Trojans.
- Gee, I just ran out.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.434
Captain Mucus!

42:01.603 --> 42:05.606
- Captain Mucus! Have you found anything?
- Nothing, Commander. Nothing.

42:05.773 --> 42:09.276
Search all the marketplaces,
the square, the alleys.

42:09.444 --> 42:14.948
Half you men, search that area there.
And the others will run with Mucus.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.871
We've gotta get out of Rome.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.790
But how? The streets
are crawling with soldiers.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.250
See?

42:30.715 --> 42:35.135
We'll never get out of here.
Only a miracle can save us.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.847
- Miracle!
- Miracle!

42:39.015 --> 42:40.474
- Miracle!
- Miracle!

42:42.143 --> 42:45.771
We've gotta get to that wagon.
Wait here, I'll see if the coast is clear.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.401
Come on. Hurry.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.746
No, you don't.

43:06.834 --> 43:10.796
Oh, my God! I'm fighting with cardboard.

43:10.964 --> 43:13.632
- Goodbye, head.
- Hello, balls.

43:18.263 --> 43:20.430
- Come on, run, Comicus.
- Come on, hurry.

43:21.683 --> 43:25.602
- OK, hurry, take off.
- Let's go, Miracle.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.860
What... Commander, where are they?

43:34.028 --> 43:38.532
Get the horses.
Get the chariots. Get the men.

43:38.700 --> 43:40.117
Onward!

43:40.785 --> 43:42.786
Get me an ice pack. Hurry.

43:46.708 --> 43:49.334
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.179
Here come the bad guys.

44:01.347 --> 44:04.891
Run, Miracle, hurry!
They're gaining on us.

44:05.059 --> 44:08.520
- Hurry!
- Come on, Miracle. Go, boy.

44:08.688 --> 44:10.814
Come on, men. We're gaining on them.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.899
They're gaining on us.

44:13.943 --> 44:15.193
Come on, Miracle.

44:16.404 --> 44:20.198
Go, boy, go!
Stretch out those long white legs!

44:23.995 --> 44:27.539
We're pulling away.
We're losing them.

44:27.874 --> 44:30.208
Run, run!

44:30.376 --> 44:32.544
Quickly, go to the left.

44:32.712 --> 44:35.714
Go to the right. Stop!

44:41.054 --> 44:43.347
I smell something familiar.

44:43.514 --> 44:47.059
Laz! Laz, I got an idea! Pull over.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.353
Pull over!

44:51.147 --> 44:53.273
- I knew I smelled something.
- You crazy?

44:53.441 --> 44:57.444
Think I don't know what I'm talking about?
The nose knows.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.446
What the heck is he...

44:59.614 --> 45:02.074
- What's he doing?
- Picking flowers.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.618
- Roman Red.
- Roman Red?

45:04.786 --> 45:07.788
A whole field of wacky weedus.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.749
- He's picking those weeds.
- Papyrus.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.959
Rolling papyrus.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.213
- Paper! Paper!
- What? Like this?

45:16.381 --> 45:18.131
That's good.

45:20.802 --> 45:23.553
Easy, whitus.
These people don't know the value.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.390
Josephus, hurry.

45:36.150 --> 45:39.277
Hold this. Yes, indeed.

45:39.445 --> 45:42.531
- They'll be here any minute.
- Not to worry. Not to worry.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.784
We are now armed with mighty joint.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.995
- Pull out.
- Let's go, Miracle.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.415
Hurry, we've got to catch them.

45:53.709 --> 45:54.960
Quickly, after them.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.261
Oh, mama!

46:04.887 --> 46:07.722
We've got to... We've got to...

46:07.890 --> 46:09.850
get moving.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.978
- It's working!
- It's working!

46:14.188 --> 46:17.107
We gotta stay loose, you know?

46:17.275 --> 46:21.027
Let it cool.
Let the coolness get into our vertebrae.

46:36.711 --> 46:38.712
You men go northward.

46:38.880 --> 46:43.675
You go southward.
I'm gonna walk here, round in a circle.

46:49.056 --> 46:50.891
What are we gonna do? We're trapped.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.896
- Hey, who's that?
- Look what he's done!

46:56.647 --> 46:57.814
Oh, my God.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.404
Oh, what a wonderful man.

47:05.573 --> 47:08.074
Let's go, Miracle.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.257
And keep 'em up.

47:28.429 --> 47:31.097
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

47:31.265 --> 47:34.434
An old man! They don't let you live!
They don't let you breathe!

47:37.188 --> 47:40.065
You son of a bitch...

47:43.027 --> 47:46.071
- No, go this way. It's a short cut.
- To where?

47:46.239 --> 47:48.698
The port. There's a ship leaving for Judaea.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.784
- Judaea?
- Judaea.

47:50.952 --> 47:52.452
Judaea!

47:59.210 --> 48:02.587
I'm gonna stay right here.

48:02.755 --> 48:05.131
No, I'm gonna move here.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.844
- You care if it falls?
- What?

48:10.012 --> 48:13.306
- The Roman Empire.
- Fuck it.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.311
Is that our men?

48:18.479 --> 48:19.646
Why have they stopped?

48:22.316 --> 48:24.734
- Oh, Marcus!
- Why have you stopped?

48:24.902 --> 48:28.822
Why aren't you still chasing them?
Have you lost your senses?

48:28.990 --> 48:31.783
Do you want to be stripped
of rank and privileges?

48:31.951 --> 48:35.787
Do you want to be thrown into
the dungeon? Do you want to...

48:37.665 --> 48:39.332
Do you want to dance?

48:39.709 --> 48:41.668
Lindus!

49:15.411 --> 49:19.623
Hey, look. There's the ship
that's gonna take us to Judaea.

49:19.790 --> 49:24.127
We're off on the road to Judaea

49:24.295 --> 49:28.715
We certainly do get around

49:41.437 --> 49:44.898
See? I told you
there was work to be found here.

49:46.984 --> 49:51.905
You're right. "Help wanted. Cashier, waiter
and dishwasher." I'm gonna be waiter.

49:52.073 --> 49:54.157
- Cashier.
- I'll be the hat-check girl.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.993
- What are you...
- All right, I'll be the dishwasher.

49:57.161 --> 50:01.247
Hey, kids. I'll take Miracle
and scout the area for a possible club date.

50:01.415 --> 50:05.085
I'll try Galilee. I heard that
King Herod is bringing in gambling.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.462
Let's go, Miracle.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.757
- Take care, Swiftus.
- Bye, Miracle.

50:13.052 --> 50:14.928
Comicus.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.182
Sir.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.978
- Sorry.
- Now, tonight, we have a private party.

50:24.146 --> 50:30.235
Take their orders. Be correct. Be polite. And
push the mulled wine, we're stuck with it.

50:30.403 --> 50:32.320
"Push the mulled wine, we're..."

50:32.488 --> 50:34.864
- Don't write it now. Now go.
- Yes, sir.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.411
Can't get any good help today.

50:43.624 --> 50:47.919
Before this night is over,
one of you shall betray me three times.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.337
No, no.

50:49.505 --> 50:52.090
Master, how can you feel
anyone here would betray you?

50:52.258 --> 50:54.676
You, who we'd follow even unto death?

50:54.844 --> 50:56.469
Yes, yes.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.722
Does everybody want soup?

50:58.889 --> 51:01.975
Please, we must talk.
This may be our last supper.

51:02.143 --> 51:05.478
Hey, it's my first order.
One question and I'll let you all go.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.106
Are you all together,
or is it separate checks?

51:08.274 --> 51:11.735
- Please go away! Go away.
- All right, OK, OK.

51:11.902 --> 51:14.487
Yea, yea, so you say.

51:14.655 --> 51:18.450
But one who sits amongst us
has already betrayed me this night.

51:18.617 --> 51:21.161
- Who?
- Who? Who can it be?

51:21.328 --> 51:22.871
Judas!

51:23.038 --> 51:26.332
Do you want a beverage?
Try the mulled wine, it's terrific.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.251
No! Leave us alone.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.295
Go, go.

51:30.463 --> 51:32.464
All right, all right. Jesus!

51:32.631 --> 51:35.008
- Yes?
- What?

51:35.176 --> 51:37.427
- What?
- What?

51:37.595 --> 51:38.678
Yes.

51:38.846 --> 51:39.888
- Jesus!
- What?

51:40.055 --> 51:41.222
- Yes?
- What?

51:41.390 --> 51:43.016
Well, you said "What?"

51:43.184 --> 51:44.267
What?

51:44.435 --> 51:45.727
Nothing.

51:47.271 --> 51:50.565
- Ah. Leonardo.
- Buongiorno.

51:50.733 --> 51:54.027
- Just a second...
- It's all right. We ordered a group portrait.

52:03.746 --> 52:07.874
This is no good.
All I got is the backs.

52:11.212 --> 52:16.174
OK. Everybody wanna be in the picture,
get up and go to the other side of the table.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.149
Hold it.

53:21.073 --> 53:24.242
The year was 1489.

53:24.410 --> 53:27.161
The black plague ravaged the continent.

53:27.329 --> 53:30.832
It was the hour of the infamous auto-da-fé,

53:31.000 --> 53:34.711
where, for public amusement,
heretics and non-believers

53:34.879 --> 53:38.089
were tortured and burned
in a carnival-like atmosphere.

53:38.257 --> 53:41.885
And it was guided by
the most fearful specter

53:42.052 --> 53:45.555
to ever sit in judgment over good and evil:

53:45.723 --> 53:50.143
The Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada.

53:50.311 --> 53:52.353
All pay heed.

53:52.521 --> 53:55.315
Now enters His Holiness, Torquemada,

53:55.482 --> 53:58.318
the Grand Inquisitor
of the Spanish Inquisition.

54:05.993 --> 54:09.871
Torquemada.
Do not implore him for compassion.

54:10.039 --> 54:13.833
Torquemada. Do not
beg him for forgiveness.

54:14.001 --> 54:17.170
Torquemada. Do not ask him for mercy.

54:17.338 --> 54:21.507
Let's face it,
you can't talk him outta anything.

54:22.092 --> 54:26.012
Let all those who wish
to confess their evil ways,

54:26.180 --> 54:29.515
and to accept and embrace the true Church,

54:29.683 --> 54:33.853
convert now, or forever burn in hell.

54:34.021 --> 54:38.358
For now begins the Inquisition.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.115
The Inquisition, let's begin

54:46.283 --> 54:48.368
The Inquisition, look out sin

54:48.535 --> 54:53.206
- We have a mission to convert the Jews
- Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jews

54:53.374 --> 54:55.500
We're gonna teach them wrong from right

54:55.668 --> 54:57.919
We're gonna help them see the light

54:58.087 --> 55:02.840
- And make an offer that they can't refuse
- That the Jews just can't refuse

55:03.008 --> 55:04.676
Confess

55:04.843 --> 55:07.345
Don't be boring

55:07.513 --> 55:09.514
Say yes

55:09.682 --> 55:10.974
Don't be dull

55:12.267 --> 55:13.977
A fact

55:14.144 --> 55:16.854
You're ignoring

55:17.022 --> 55:20.400
It's better to lose
your skullcap than your skull

55:20.567 --> 55:21.734
Oy, oy, gevald

55:21.902 --> 55:24.028
The Inquisition, what a show

55:24.196 --> 55:26.322
The Inquisition, here we go

55:26.490 --> 55:31.119
We know you're wishing that we'd go away

55:31.286 --> 55:35.164
But the Inquisition's here
and it's here to stay

55:35.332 --> 55:36.374
Oh, boy

55:36.542 --> 55:39.043
The Inquisition, what joy

55:39.211 --> 55:41.838
The Inquisition, oy, oy

55:43.674 --> 55:47.176
I was sitting in a temple,
I was minding my own business

55:47.344 --> 55:50.388
I was listening to a lovely Hebrew Mass

55:50.556 --> 55:53.349
These Papist persons plunge in,
throw me in a dungeon

55:53.517 --> 55:56.352
And they shove a red-hot poker up my ass

55:56.729 --> 56:00.106
Is that considerate? Is that polite?

56:00.274 --> 56:04.152
And not a tube of Preparation H in sight

56:05.112 --> 56:08.156
I'm flicking chickens,
looking through the pickings

56:08.323 --> 56:10.450
And suddenly these goys
break down my walls

56:11.577 --> 56:14.287
I didn't even know them,
they grabbed me by the scrotum

56:14.455 --> 56:17.290
And they started playing
Ping-Pong with my balls

56:17.458 --> 56:20.793
Oy, the agony! Oh, the shame

56:20.961 --> 56:24.338
To make my privates public for a game

56:29.303 --> 56:31.637
The Inquisition, what a show

56:31.805 --> 56:34.140
The Inquisition, here we go

56:34.308 --> 56:39.312
We know you're wishing that we'd go away

56:39.480 --> 56:42.315
But the Inquisition’s here
and it's here to...

56:42.483 --> 56:44.567
Hey, Torquemada, what do you say?

56:44.735 --> 56:49.322
- I just got back from the auto-da-fé
- Auto-da-fé? What's an auto-da-fé?

56:49.490 --> 56:52.450
It's what you oughtn't to do
but you do anyway

56:57.164 --> 56:59.665
- Will you convert?
- No, no, no, no

56:59.833 --> 57:02.126
- Will you confess?
- No, no, no, no

57:02.294 --> 57:04.587
- Will you revert?
- No, no, no, no

57:04.755 --> 57:07.215
- Will you say yes?
- No, no, no, no

57:07.382 --> 57:09.967
Now, I asked in a nice way,
I said pretty please

57:10.135 --> 57:13.221
I bent their ears,
now I'll work on their knees!

57:35.452 --> 57:38.496
Hey, Torquemada, walk this way

57:40.499 --> 57:42.708
We got a little game you might want to play

57:42.876 --> 57:45.545
So pull that handle, try your luck

57:45.712 --> 57:48.047
Who knows, Torque, you might win a buck

57:48.215 --> 57:50.007
All right!

58:07.317 --> 58:09.402
Put it in the car.

58:10.028 --> 58:11.737
- In the car.
- In the car.

58:14.992 --> 58:17.201
How we doing? Any converts today?

58:17.369 --> 58:20.246
Not a one, nay, nay, nay

58:20.414 --> 58:23.666
We've flattened their fingers,
we've branded their buns

58:23.834 --> 58:26.169
Nothing is working

58:27.379 --> 58:29.088
Send in the nuns!

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.389
The Inquisition, what a show

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.892
The Inquisition, here we go

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:52.982
We know you're wishing that we'd go away

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:56.610
So come on, you Muslims and you Jews

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:59.572
We got big news for all of yous

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.116
You better change your point of view

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:05.411
Tonight

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:08.247
'Cause the Inquisition’s here

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.499
And it's here

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:17.298
To stay

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:40.988
Paris. A city filled
with poverty, misery and despair.

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:45.076
The time was ripe for revolution.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.537
Apple cores!

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:52.500
Freshly picked from the garbage of the rich.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:56.295
Apple cores. Apple cores.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.589
Rats. Rats.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.342
Nice dead rats for sale.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.888
Perfect for rat stew, rat soup, rat pie,

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:09.600
and the ever-popular ratatouille.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:12.561
Nothing. Nothing.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:15.606
I got absolutely nothing for sale.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.447
Sir, please help me.
I'm starving to death.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:27.326
- Help, give me something...
- Get away. Don't bother me, you swine.

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:30.329
Please, money, food, anything.
Help me, help...

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.833
Get your filthy hands off me. Begone.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.086
Please!

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.171
Something, anything.
I'm starving to death...

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.550
Look what we have come to.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:46.679
Beggars begging from beggars.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.023
Bonjour, Madame Defarge.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.443
Bonjour, scum.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.820
All keep quiet. The meeting begins.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.573
Fellow wretches.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:10.828
I don't have to tell you
that poverty stalks the streets of Paris.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.705
Yeah!

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:16.584
Families don't even have
enough money for bread.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:19.128
- No.
- We are down to almost nothing.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:23.466
Last week, I myself ran out of wool.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.387
- We have no rights.
- No.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:31.390
- We have no say.
- No.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:34.518
- We have no dignity!
- No!

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:40.024
We are so poor,
we do not even have a language.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:42.651
Just a stupid accent.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:48.199
She's right! She's right.
We all talk like Maurice Chevalier.

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:54.788
What we need is a new language.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:04:01.545
A song that speaks of struggle,
that speaks of triumph...

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.259
- It is time for action!
- Yes!

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.930
Everybody stand.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.682
Repeat after me...

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:25.277
No, no, no. Dumb scum.

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:29.073
I mean death to King Louis.

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:33.118
Death to King Louis.

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:36.121
Good! Good.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:41.752
And now, let's end this meeting
on a high note.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:57.309
Oh, but with this long trip and
this exhausting conversation, I'm famished.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:58.978
Bearnaise?

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:01.063
Yes?

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:06.110
Do we have any of those
delicious raisins left?

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.196
You ate yours.

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:11.365
These are mine.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:14.868
Au contraire. They are mine.
I paid for them.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.620
Hand them over.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.086
Au contraire.
I paid for them. Those are mine.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.173
Don't be saucy with me, Bearnaise.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.854
Count de Money.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.773
Count de Money.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:49.278
Count de Money, Count de Money.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:54.241
- Count de Money, Count de Money!
- De Monet, de Monet.

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:57.620
- Count de Money.
- Count de Money.

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:09.757
We should get rid of your tailor.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:14.595
I don't like your cuffs. I don't like
your cuffs, I don't like your cuffs.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:20.142
A man's cuffs should be even
with the tip of his pee-pee.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.896
Yours are all the way down to your balls.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:28.817
- At least I have them.
- You bitch.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.448
- Lackey!
- Count de Money.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.575
De Monet.

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:39.912
- Monet. Say it! Monet. Monet.
- Mo... Mo..net.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.873
Mo...net.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.751
Perfect. Don't forget it.
Give it to me again. Monet.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:48.295
- Monet.
- Very good. Where's His Majesty?

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.506
Sir, the king is playing chess.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.718
Chess? I hate chess.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.977
It's your move, Your Majesty.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:10.401
I'm quite aware of that, you petit putz.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.446
I see.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:22.538
Knight to rook four.

01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:32.005
- Your move, Poppinjay.
- Yes, sire.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:43.767
- Pawn threatens bishop.
- What the hell did you say?

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.395
Pawn threatens bishop.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.939
All right. I understood.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:53.986
Pawn threatens bishop. All right, Poppinjay.
I'm invoking the king's privilege.

01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:56.321
Three moves to one. Yes!

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.286
Knight jumps queen.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:06.498
Bishop jumps queen.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.670
Pawns jump queen.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:19.344
Gangbang! Come on,
let's all jump the queen.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:25.142
Whip out those little dicks!
Here we go.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:34.693
What a spectacle.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:42.117
Isn’t the queen a good sport?

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:46.537
And he is such a fool. Nevertheless,
we must do everything we can

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:50.459
to save the thing that divine right
and history have placed on his head.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:54.630
- His wig?
- No, you twit. His crown.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.590
The symbol of "Might makes right."

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:59.885
The thing that our fortunes
and titles are attached to.

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:01.470
The monarchy.

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:06.725
- Are you going to speak to His Majesty?
- Perhaps later.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.562
We had a bouncy journey,
I must relieve myself before I burst.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.232
- Where is the garçon de piss?
- I saw him just now.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.359
Oh, there he is. Over there.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.822
- Oh, merci, monsieur.
- Piss boy!

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.282
Ah, oui, monsieur. Oui.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.411
- Oui, oui?
- Yes, a lot of it.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.372
S'il vous plaît.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.880
Keep searching. You'll find it.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.424
Oh, leave me alone. I can handle this.

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:51.520
You look familiar. Who do you look like?

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:54.022
Je ne sais pas.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.445
Who is that girl? She's gorgeous.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:08.287
- Pardon, pardon, pardon.
- Yes?

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.789
You are pissing on my shoe.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:13.500
- Sorry. Mind your pail!
- Sorry, sorry.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:22.676
Wait for the shake.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.601
Now, there. That's for you.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.561
Piss off.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.273
Thank you. I'll get it later.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.069
Oh, that's better.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.782
Let the queen up, give the queen some air.
She's been so good to all of us.

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:54.374
Ooh! There's a naughty bit of crumpet.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.884
Oh, Your Majesty.

01:11:04.052 --> 01:11:07.679
- How's it going, Marie?
- Oh, you are so naughty.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.727
It's good to be the king.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:35.082
Everything's so green!

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:38.377
Majesty, may I have a word with you?

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:41.088
- Care for a little toot?
- Non, merci.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.674
Don't indulge, eh?
Well, leaves more for us.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:49.054
- Who are you?
- Your Majesty, I am Mademoiselle Rimbaud.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.349
Nice names.

01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:56.144
- Tell me, my dear, what can I do for you?
- Your Majesty.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:01.108
My father, Monsieur Rimbaud,
for ten years has languished in the Bastille.

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:03.902
If I don't get him out soon,
he will surely die.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:07.322
I throw myself on your mercy.
Please release him.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:12.411
- Why was he put into the Bastille?
- He said something at a royal dinner party.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:17.332
- What did he say?
- He said, "The poor ain't so bad."

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:22.587
Pouilly Fuissé! "The poor ain't so bad"?
You're lucky he's still alive.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:27.759
Please, Your Majesty, don't let him die.
I'll do anything to gain his pardon, anything.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.137
Anything?

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:35.934
Your Majesty, I was raised in a convent.
I don't indulge in pleasures of the flesh.

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:40.272
You don't put out, he don't get out.

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:43.942
Your Majesty, I simply don't do it.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:48.488
Come on, you do it. You know you do it.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:52.034
We all do it. We love to do it. You do it.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.953
- No, I don't.
- You want to do it. I do it.

01:12:55.121 --> 01:13:01.293
I love to do it. I just did it and I'm ready
to do it again. Don't tell me you don't do it.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:06.548
Now, either you do it, or your father dies.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.925
It's either hump or death.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:13.972
- Humperdinck?
- Not Humperdinck. "Hump or death."

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.643
You got ten seconds to make up your mind.
Hump. Death. Hump. Death. Hump. Death.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.312
Hump. Death. Hump. Death.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.731
Hump. Death. Your time is running out!
Hump. Death...

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.108
All right, all right. Hump!

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:31.239
Very good. I'm glad you thought it over.
Be at my chambers at midnight.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.492
A toute à l'heure.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:34.826
Wait!

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.871
Don't wear anything...

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:40.248
complicated.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:55.013
It's good to be the king.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.729
Your Majesty,
I must have a word with you...

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.857
Ah, the Count de Money.

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:08.527
- De Mo...
- Don't correct me. What is it?

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:10.612
Of course, Your Majesty.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:14.950
I've come on most urgent business.
It is said that the people are revolting.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.577
You said it. They stink on ice.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:22.499
No, this is a very serious problem. The
peasants feel you have no regard for them.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:25.794
What? I have no regard for the peasants?

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:29.131
They are my people. I am their sovereign.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.300
I love them. Pull!

01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:40.058
- Drifting to the left.
- Your Majesty, the situation is worsening.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:42.769
The peasants may grow violent.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.188
- Violent? You think?
- Yes.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.066
I hate violence. It's the one thing I detest.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:51.069
Violence. I abhor it.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.737
Pull!

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:56.241
Fell like a stone.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:15:01.913
But, Your Majesty, just in case of the
remote possibility of a temporary revolution,

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:06.251
don't you think it would be wise
to have you safely spirited out of Paris?

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:12.090
Perhaps you're right. But who
would sit on my throne in my absence?

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:18.346
- We'll find a double, put him on the throne.
- Ah. A double in case of trouble. I like it.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.936
But where would you find
a handsome dog to replace me?

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.566
Oh, yes, of course, of course. That's it!

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:35.697
- Your Majesty, you look like the piss boy!
- And you look like a bucket of shit!

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.866
No, you don't understand, Your Majesty.

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:41.912
It is God's will.
Except for the beauty mark and mustache.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.623
- There's our double.
- Sacrebleu!

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.958
You're right. I do look like the piss boy.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:51.463
All right. At the first sign
of trouble, he shall be the king.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:53.757
- Go.
- Immediately, sire.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:57.636
Bearnaise! Garçon,
I must have a word with you.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.305
- I'm not finished.
- You are. Come with me.

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:03.099
- You're finished.
- I'm finished.

01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:05.227
Lackey.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.272
Your Majesty.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.741
It's good to be the king.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:24.746
- Good. Now the beauty mark.
- It's coming.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:35.757
Wonderful. No one would ever suspect
that His Royal Highness

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:39.302
is really the lowly piss boy.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.723
This is never gonna work.
Please, Count de Money...

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:45.850
De Monet, de Monet.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:49.271
De Monet, Dubonnet, Ciboney -
it's not gonna work.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.524
I can't behave like a king.
I don't know king things.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.361
Please, let... See? See?
I can't even walk like a king.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.990
I can't walk in heels.
I'm no good in heels. He's good in heels.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:03.952
This'll never work. Why are you
doing this to me? What's this about?

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.455
Why are you dressing me like the king?
Why do I have to be the king?

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:11.042
It's very simple, really.
Is my hair all right?

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.878
- Dreadful.
- Well, fix it.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:20.760
Yes. You see, recently, there has
been a rumor about a revolution.

01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:23.430
And if this revolution should succeed,

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:26.057
the first thing the people will do
is cut off the king's head.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.936
If there is a double on the throne,
the king can remain in safety

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:33.231
- while they cut off the double's head.
- I get it.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:37.068
Whoa! I get it! I get it!

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:41.948
- They're here to cut off my head?
- Hide in there, I'll see who it is.

01:17:49.749 --> 01:17:55.587
All right, take me! Ravage me,
Your Majesty. A bargain is a bargain.

01:17:56.714 --> 01:18:00.091
- All right.
- Wait! You're not the king.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:05.138
True, true. I am the Count de Money...
De Monet, de Monet.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:09.434
But the king is temporarily indisposed.
You've come to the right place.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:10.727
Please.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:20.528
You seem troubled, my dear.
Let me help you.

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:25.617
- I don't see how you can.
- Why not?

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:31.790
I've decided to trade my virginity
for my father's freedom,

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:36.419
and submit to the king's lustful wants.

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.463
Oh, lustful wa...

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.843
Chipped.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:48.098
This is the saddest night of my life.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:52.310
And the happiest night of mine.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.064
Excuse me.

01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:03.321
Count?

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.491
Count de Money? Count de Money?

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:09.244
De Monet... De Monet...

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:11.704
Excuse me, did you see the count?

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:14.040
He was here a moment ago...

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:19.337
All right, Your Majesty. Please ravage me.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.673
Gee, I just ate. I want...

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:25.009
- Take me, Your Majesty, take me!
- Where?

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:31.933
Despoil me! Humiliate me!
Only do it! Do it! Hump! Hump! Hump!

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:35.937
It's good to be the king.
Look, come here. Let's talk about this.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:38.606
Why don't we have
a wonderful candlelit dinner?

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:42.360
Then a couple of magnums of wine,
see a few nude paintings.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:46.698
- Get in the mood, you know what I mean?
- Your Majesty, I don't understand.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:52.036
You said if I let you have your way with me,
you'd let my father out of the dungeon.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.747
Ah! That's what I said.

01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:58.585
Look, for all intents and purposes,
I'm the king, right?

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:01.921
Why don't we go to my desk?
There must be a pardon in the desk,

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.716
and we'll get your daddy
out of jail. Come on.

01:20:04.884 --> 01:20:09.554
Let's look through the desk. Must be
thousands of pardons in the king's desk.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:12.807
Here we go. OK.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:18.730
Execution, execution, execution,
execution, execution, ex... Tough guy.

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:22.275
This can't be...
Must be a pardon somewhere. Let's see.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:28.156
Ah! One. One left. We're lucky. Yes.

01:20:28.908 --> 01:20:31.075
Let's see. Your father's name?

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.619
Rimbaud.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:35.914
Rimbaud? How do you spell "R..."?
Oh, never mind.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.833
- Rimbaud. Is that French?
- Oui.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:44.297
All right. Here we go. July 14, 1789,

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:47.926
signed by Louis...
quatorze, quinze, sixteen...

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:51.387
- How do you say "sixteen" in French?
- Seize.

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:55.433
Seize you. Good.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:05.443
Now, you give this to the head officer
at the jail, and he will set your father free.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.029
Your Majesty.

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:14.160
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, quack, tweet, tweet.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:17.830
Hello? No song for me today, Pierre?

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:21.459
What's the matter with you?
Cat got your tongue?

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:27.507
I was right. He got his tongue,
eyes and beak. The lot.

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:30.051
Oh, dearie me.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:33.096
Not so lucky, Pierre

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:39.477
Oh, you. You naughty pussy.
Naughty, naughty pussy.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:43.314
And now, to invent the catapult.

01:21:47.695 --> 01:21:49.362
He's in there.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.825
Father!

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.621
Oh, my darling father, I have good news.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:00.331
You're free.

01:22:02.293 --> 01:22:07.505
Free! Did you hear that,
my little winged friends? Free. Free!

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:11.217
And so, they shall be free too.

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:20.143
Fly, my pretty one. Fly.

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:24.355
Away! The sky is your playground.

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.900
Happy landing, Mother, Mrs. Schultz.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:31.779
Hurry, father. Hurry,
before the king changes his mind.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.825
What a racket! How can I sleep?

01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:37.660
Guns, fireworks...

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:40.747
Your Majesty!

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:46.294
Quick, you've got to escape.
They're storming the palace.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.172
So that's the noise. The revolution!

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:53.426
- Free, I'm free...
- My father, the man you pardoned.

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:57.472
Thank you, Your Highness.
I thought I'd never live to see the day

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.225
- when I would once again...
- Yes, yes.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.395
Dad!

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:08.358
What fool put a carpet on the wall?

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:10.193
- Hurry up.
- Quick, Dad.

01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:12.695
You're not as tall as you used to be.

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:14.322
- I was wrong.
- Quick, follow me.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.074
Quick, hurry.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.456
What the... Who designed this place?

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:31.089
That way, that way.

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:35.885
- There he is.
- Wait, wait. You're making a big mistake.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:38.638
- In the name of the people of France...
- Fronce.

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:43.768
..Fronce, we place you,
King Louis, under arrest.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:47.897
But, dot dot dot, you don't understand!

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:51.609
Take him away. Take them all away.

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:54.779
No, wait! I'm with you.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:59.283
Whee! Whee!

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:19.303
Oh, Jacques, Jacques.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:23.975
Courage, my dear. Watch me,
and take heart by my example.

01:24:24.601 --> 01:24:28.187
I may not have been born a king,
or lived like a king,

01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:30.898
but I can die like a king.

01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:34.610
Your Majesty? You're next.

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:38.114
- Do you require a blindfold?
- None.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.616
- Have you any last words?
- None.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.578
Test the guillotine.

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:48.332
Holy shit! Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:52.336
- Last request, last request.
- What is your last request?

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:55.965
- Novocaine.
- Wait a moment.

01:24:56.717 --> 01:25:00.470
There is no such thing
known to medical science.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:04.640
- I'll wait.
- Seize him!

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.268
Off with his head! Off with his head!

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.354
Oh, please, listen to me. I'm not the king.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:12.273
Bullshit!

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.692
It's a very hard crowd.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.403
- Seize him.
- Wait. Wait a minute. Gimme a break.

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:21.824
- Put his head on the block.
- Wait, I don't want to die. Don't hurt me.

01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:36.839
Only a miracle can save him.

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.220
It's Miracle!

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:46.682
I don't believe it! Josephus!

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.726
Whoa!

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:51.896
- Hey, baby! Get down. Get down.
- Jump!

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:07.620
How'd you get all the way here
from the Roman Empire?

01:26:07.788 --> 01:26:12.333
Don't be square, mon cher.
Movies is magic.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:20.508
We had better kiss soon.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:25.221
- Why?
- We're coming to the end. See?

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:27.932
Oh, my darling...

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.686
Oh, my darling.

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:37.817
Looks like it's a big ending.

01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:52.748
Wait! Where are you going?

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:58.629
Coming soon! Don't miss
History of the World Part ll.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:01.549
See Hitler on ice.

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:19.317
See a Viking funeral.

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:43.841
See Jews in space.

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:52.350
We're Jews out in space

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.519
We're zooming along,
protecting the Hebrew race

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:59.690
We're Jews out in space

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:03.861
If trouble appears,
we'll put it right back in its place

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:08.199
When goyim attack us

01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:10.993
We'll give them a smack,
we'll slap them right back in the face

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:31.430
We're Jews out in space

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:38.521
We're zooming along,
protecting the Hebrew race

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:38.604
We're zooming along,
protecting the Hebrew race
