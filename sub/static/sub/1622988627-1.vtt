WEBVTT

01:36.208 --> 01:37.708
Don't be scared.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.333
Hey?

05:04.500 --> 05:05.667
Tucker?

05:06.542 --> 05:07.542
Tucker?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.167
Tucker?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.125
Breathe. Just breathe.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.000
It's clean.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.792
Radiation?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.458
No, no radiation.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.000
No neurological damage.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.708
Where's Holden?

05:46.958 --> 05:48.125
She crossed over.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.333
That puts you in command.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.167
- We need to report.
- Yes.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.667
How long until
the tide comes back in?

06:05.750 --> 06:07.250
Six hours and 45 minutes.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.042
OK. We'll use that time
to gather data.

06:09.125 --> 06:10.750
I want to report results
by then.

06:11.208 --> 06:12.375
Let's gear up.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
I'm gonna do
the first recon on my own.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.667
<i>Blake. Can you hear me?</i>

07:12.750 --> 07:15.917
- First recon underway at 8:17.
<i>- Copy.</i>

07:16.542 --> 07:17.792
Argh...

07:42.708 --> 07:44.292
<i>What's it like out there?</i>

07:45.292 --> 07:46.458
Still flat.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.042
We should go into detail.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.750
<i>What ya got?</i>

07:53.000 --> 07:54.417
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

08:11.500 --> 08:13.625
<i>Confirming
biogeochemical recycling.</i>

08:13.750 --> 08:15.500
This exceeds
the model's predictions.

08:23.292 --> 08:24.583
Can you classify?

08:25.083 --> 08:26.500
<i>Chelicerata.</i>

08:26.917 --> 08:28.250
Clearly a reproductive.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.207
I'm guessing
internal fertilisation.

08:38.042 --> 08:39.000
We should test.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.500
It's too soon.

08:41.582 --> 08:44.167
We've been away from Kepler's
radiation for 563 days.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.792
<i>It's worth a shot.</i>

08:49.208 --> 08:51.667
<i>Run the biometer.
That's an order.</i>

09:11.042 --> 09:12.958
Erythrocyte count
is normal range.

09:13.042 --> 09:16.125
- Yeah, haemoglobin's the same.
- Minor reduction in leukocytes.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.625
Well, that's a good sign,
right?

09:19.542 --> 09:20.833
Negative.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.042
Hey, Blake.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.542
<i>At least it's a prospect.</i>

09:38.875 --> 09:40.083
Moving on.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.458
Blake?
I'm tracking some weather.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.167
I'm getting a high
humidity reading.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.083
<i>The patterns
are changing real fast.</i>

09:56.500 --> 09:58.917
Copy. What are they?

09:59.375 --> 10:01.792
<i>Ah... Aurelia aurita.</i>

10:01.875 --> 10:04.750
They reproduce
both sexually and asexually.

10:19.292 --> 10:20.750
- What happened?
- It stung me.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.458
<i>Your vitals are fine.</i>

10:22.583 --> 10:24.292
<i>They have these barbs
on their tentacles.</i>

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
Maybe I should've
warned you about that.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.333
Thank you.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.750
<i>Blake, the weather's
getting worse.</i>

10:31.083 --> 10:32.750
<i>It's probably
a storm coming in.</i>

10:34.292 --> 10:36.083
<i>Let's send
what we've got so far.</i>

10:45.792 --> 10:47.000
<i>Our next communication window</i>

10:47.083 --> 10:48.958
<i>is in four hours
and five minutes.</i>

10:49.083 --> 10:50.250
Copy.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.833
I lost visibility.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.250
You better come back to base.
I'll shoot you a flare.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.417
Got it. Coming in.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.958
- That was quick.
<i>- What was?</i>

12:11.083 --> 12:13.458
- You.
- But I'm still two clicks away.

12:19.875 --> 12:20.958
<i>Tucker?</i>

12:21.500 --> 12:23.208
<i>Tucker, do you copy?</i>

12:28.000 --> 12:28.958
Blake, go again.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.083
- What's going on?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

12:32.292 --> 12:34.042
–

12:45.333 --> 12:47.000
- Tucker!
- –

13:21.542 --> 13:23.875
Help! Blake!

13:25.750 --> 13:27.458
Help!

14:35.833 --> 14:37.500
- What happened?
- They came out of nowhere.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.250
Survivors?

14:46.833 --> 14:47.833
Mmm.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.458
I'm going to get you the meds.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.875
- Hey!
<i>- Agi!</i>

15:21.958 --> 15:23.875
My colleague
needs medical help!

15:31.958 --> 15:33.417
I saw a child, Tucker.

15:34.833 --> 15:35.750
A child.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.625
Keep pressure on it.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.125
<i>Enugoro! Ordu!</i>

16:29.083 --> 16:31.042
<i>Kumit. Kick na ooke.</i>

16:31.458 --> 16:32.625
<i>Hilfen.</i>

16:36.583 --> 16:37.583
<i>Hilfen.</i>

16:38.667 --> 16:39.917
<i>Hilfoken.</i>

16:46.583 --> 16:48.167
I need my medical equipment.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.750
- Do you understand me?
- <i>Mayi ye nel ye.</i>

16:54.833 --> 16:56.250
Narvik!

16:56.917 --> 16:58.083
Where is it?

17:00.958 --> 17:02.000
Where is it?

17:03.792 --> 17:04.833
In the pod.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.833
–

17:30.000 --> 17:31.333
<i>Mish griev.</i>

17:50.208 --> 17:51.458
<i>Men ai nochte zere.</i>

17:54.042 --> 17:55.417
Then hold him still.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.750
I said keep him still!

19:18.625 --> 19:19.708
Tucker?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.167
- Tucker.
- Blake...

19:23.833 --> 19:27.125
A whole community.
I saw babies.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.292
Babies, Tucker!

19:32.042 --> 19:34.083
- We have to let Kepler know.
- How?

19:35.833 --> 19:37.500
They destroyed the pod...

19:37.833 --> 19:39.542
the panel, everything...

19:41.125 --> 19:42.708
but I spotted the biometer.

19:43.042 --> 19:44.625
We'll just have to gain
their trust.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.458
Maybe we can find
the Ulysses 1.

19:56.750 --> 19:59.417
- I've lost too much blood.
- You don't have to do this.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.875
I'll only slow you down.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.083
Base orders.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.167
If we pose a threat
to the mission, we have...

20:07.292 --> 20:10.083
No, you're my fertility match.
87%, remember?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.583
Without transmission...

20:12.750 --> 20:14.167
none of this even matters.

20:17.000 --> 20:17.875
Go.

20:18.625 --> 20:19.750
Get the biometer.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.333
Find the Ulysses 1.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.750
Maybe he's still alive.

20:32.958 --> 20:34.125
For the many.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.167
I have something for you.

20:59.625 --> 21:00.917
I'm gonna give you one...

21:01.917 --> 21:03.542
and I'm gonna take
this one for me.

21:06.542 --> 21:09.000
My father got them
from his father.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.417
What is it?

21:19.708 --> 21:20.958
Don't be scared.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.000
Every time the second moon
passes Cygnus

21:26.458 --> 21:27.667
you light a match...

21:28.708 --> 21:30.000
and wherever I am...

21:30.250 --> 21:32.958
in a ship or on a planet
far, far away...

21:33.375 --> 21:34.250
I'll do the same.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.333
And before
the last one's gone...

21:38.292 --> 21:39.667
we'll be together again.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.667
I promise.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.667
Daddy, please don't leave me.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.792
What does Kepler teach us,
Louise?

21:52.625 --> 21:54.375
We will not think
about ourselves.

21:54.875 --> 21:56.500
We will not let
our emotions guide us.

21:56.625 --> 21:57.917
We do this for the many.

21:58.042 --> 21:58.917
Please.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.125
- For the many, Louise.
- I don't want

22:00.208 --> 22:02.625
- to be here without you.
- Say it. For the many.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.625
- For the many.
- Again, why do we do it?

22:04.750 --> 22:06.792
- For the many.
- Yes, say it, for the many.

22:06.917 --> 22:08.417
That's why we do it,
for the many.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.000
Good.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.958
For the many.
For the many. For the many.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.625
For the many. For the many.

22:21.917 --> 22:25.875
For the many. For the many.
For the many.

23:07.875 --> 23:08.917
Oh!

23:14.958 --> 23:15.958
Hey!

23:23.833 --> 23:24.750
Help!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.583
Help!

23:34.500 --> 23:35.667
Help me!

26:02.583 --> 26:04.833
She was called Mother Earth.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.875
It's close enough to the sun
to have water

26:09.208 --> 26:11.000
air and fire.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.333
There used to be
tropical jungles

26:13.417 --> 26:16.417
and mighty forests
breathing oxygen for us.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.042
And we couldn't stay?

26:20.792 --> 26:22.708
No, we plundered
everything she offered.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.958
Now, you see,
we can take this...

26:32.917 --> 26:34.042
That's it.

26:37.500 --> 26:41.250
This is the seedling
of a plant called "a tree".

26:41.958 --> 26:43.292
Will they ever grow?

26:43.667 --> 26:45.083
No, not here.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.708
Maybe I should take them
with me, what do you think?

26:49.792 --> 26:50.708
You had a signal?

26:51.250 --> 26:52.875
Yeah. I did.

26:53.375 --> 26:55.708
We left all these weather
stations around the globe.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.250
And to our surprise,
we got some data

26:59.333 --> 27:01.375
from one of the weather
stations right here.

27:01.958 --> 27:04.458
This one. It's called
the "Henderson Hub".

27:04.750 --> 27:07.500
It seems like there's
a new area of regeneration.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.167
I mean, of course,
it's miles away

27:09.250 --> 27:11.042
from any former
human civilisation

27:11.500 --> 27:12.833
but that's a good thing.

27:13.625 --> 27:16.625
Because humans basically
spoiled the rest of the Earth.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.792
Listen, if...

27:22.417 --> 27:25.917
if what we find promises
to be true and it's safe...

27:27.583 --> 27:29.833
I'll send for you, alright?

27:30.625 --> 27:31.917
You promise?

27:32.083 --> 27:33.750
- I promise.
<i>- Five, four...</i>

27:33.917 --> 27:36.042
<i>three, two...</i>

27:36.375 --> 27:37.958
<i>one, ignition!</i>

28:02.417 --> 28:06.250
For the many.
For the many. For the many.

28:06.333 --> 28:09.875
For the many. For the many.
For the many.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.708
For the many. For the many.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.167
- For the many.
- For the many. For the many.

28:25.708 --> 28:27.000
<i>Back in grot.</i>

28:29.000 --> 28:31.417
Hey! I'm thirsty!

28:32.167 --> 28:33.500
I need water!

28:33.625 --> 28:36.583
<i>Yas di iey iech?</i>

28:38.208 --> 28:39.250
Where did you get this?

28:44.625 --> 28:45.708
Hey.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.042
Can you get that...
that red case?

29:00.500 --> 29:02.625
The boy has it.
Can you get it from him?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.583
No, the red case.

29:21.042 --> 29:22.625
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

29:25.792 --> 29:27.292
<i>Wien ar vu?</i>

29:29.750 --> 29:32.458
<i>Wien... ar... vu?</i>

29:32.875 --> 29:35.708
- Oh, where am I from?
- <i>Frams eiland?</i>

29:42.792 --> 29:44.000
Earth.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.250
<i>Aarda?</i>

29:45.833 --> 29:48.667
Yes.
And very far away from here

29:48.958 --> 29:51.583
there is another planet,
Kepler 209.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.542
<i>Aarda? Wai kira?</i>

29:56.625 --> 29:58.042
Why we came to Earth?

30:00.542 --> 30:01.750
People...

30:03.708 --> 30:05.833
I mean, there are
no babies anymore.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.333
<i>No kinders?</i>

30:16.250 --> 30:17.375
Maila.

30:19.708 --> 30:20.917
I'm Blake.

30:24.708 --> 30:25.875
OK, Maila...

30:27.167 --> 30:29.083
if you could find
this thing for me.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.042
Can you bring it to me?

31:36.375 --> 31:37.542
Shh!

31:55.208 --> 31:58.125
–

32:14.833 --> 32:17.667
<i>Laat me!</i>

32:18.917 --> 32:19.792
<i>Huej!</i>

32:19.875 --> 32:23.167
<i>Laat me! Laat me!</i>

33:43.667 --> 33:45.125
Shh, shh, shh.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.667
Maila?

34:12.250 --> 34:13.667
Maila!

34:17.833 --> 34:19.042
Maila?

34:26.500 --> 34:28.875
Mama! Mama!

34:34.083 --> 34:35.917
Mama!

34:43.000 --> 34:44.458
Mama!

34:51.375 --> 34:52.583
Mama?

35:01.208 --> 35:02.417
Narvik.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.583
<i>Wier jir gan?</i>

35:10.875 --> 35:12.625
<i>Umsoyak hur hahr.</i>

35:18.333 --> 35:19.958
<i>Eiker cum kjeareah.</i>

36:19.125 --> 36:20.542
Who were those people?

36:22.542 --> 36:23.708
Who were they?

36:57.833 --> 36:58.792
Maila, she...

36:58.875 --> 36:59.875
She's your sister?

37:01.625 --> 37:02.542
Daughter.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.458
Where's her father?

37:17.583 --> 37:18.667
Flood took him.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.125
Why are you following me?

37:43.417 --> 37:44.542
I wanna help you.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.208
You just want your stuff back!

37:56.708 --> 37:59.125
<i>Nje! Nje!</i>

37:59.292 --> 38:00.458
Maila.

38:38.792 --> 38:41.792
<i>Nje! Nje!</i>

38:42.083 --> 38:43.000
Maila.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.125
- What are you doing?
- They're leaving.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.167
- That's just a flare gun.
- If they leave, she's gone!

39:00.833 --> 39:02.500
Listen to me! Shoot in the air.

39:03.750 --> 39:04.958
- Shoot in the air.
- What?

39:05.042 --> 39:06.958
They'll be distracted,
while we free her.

39:11.167 --> 39:13.333
Trust me! Give it to me!

39:13.542 --> 39:14.750
- Narvik!
- Ah!

39:31.500 --> 39:33.958
<i>Huej! Weasmea!</i>

41:01.167 --> 41:03.208
<i>Oy, wegladea!</i>

41:04.042 --> 41:04.958
<i>Oy.</i>

41:05.292 --> 41:06.917
- <i>Jea.</i>
- <i>Joa sortan wealech.</i>

42:52.583 --> 42:53.958
<i>Wa je skear je.</i>

43:04.125 --> 43:06.458
<i>Huej! Heuj! Heuj!</i>

43:22.042 --> 43:23.125
<i>Nje!</i>

43:24.542 --> 43:26.208
<i>Joa komm me!</i>

43:26.750 --> 43:29.750
<i>Kaam! Kaam!</i>

44:50.958 --> 44:52.167
<i>Kom!</i>

45:06.792 --> 45:07.958
Paling!

45:34.875 --> 45:35.958
<i>Werk.</i>

45:48.083 --> 45:49.167
<i>Werk.</i>

45:53.125 --> 45:54.167
<i>Skirra!</i>

46:01.792 --> 46:03.000
<i>Far hahr oop.</i>

46:04.292 --> 46:05.583
<i>Til Kumin avic me.</i>

46:11.000 --> 46:11.875
Blake!

46:22.917 --> 46:24.542
<i>Where hedoen vous
veined deehea?</i>

46:32.125 --> 46:33.917
<i>Vjimay yiz deehea?</i>

46:37.958 --> 46:39.875
<i>Vjimay yiz deehea?</i>

47:31.750 --> 47:32.625
Stop.

47:34.208 --> 47:35.625
Take off your cape.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.167
Take it off.

47:52.542 --> 47:53.625
Hands up.

47:54.458 --> 47:55.542
Hands up!

48:12.542 --> 48:13.875
Mind your head.

48:26.667 --> 48:27.583
Wait here.

48:45.042 --> 48:46.458
You're not from here.

49:03.792 --> 49:05.583
Are you an astronaut?

49:11.750 --> 49:12.667
She is.

49:17.542 --> 49:18.833
I can't believe it.

49:21.667 --> 49:22.917
Welcome!

49:24.500 --> 49:25.792
We've waited so long.

49:28.042 --> 49:29.208
I'm Gibson.

49:30.917 --> 49:32.125
Louise Blake, sir.

49:35.292 --> 49:36.458
Louise?

49:39.042 --> 49:40.833
Oh, God, I remember you.
You were...

49:41.458 --> 49:43.750
his size the last time
I saw you.

49:46.042 --> 49:49.042
Well, I'm sorry you didn't
receive a warmer welcome.

49:52.042 --> 49:53.250
What happened to your crew?

49:54.042 --> 49:55.167
They crossed.

49:56.958 --> 49:59.583
We had a malfunction
after entering the stratosphere.

50:01.375 --> 50:03.292
Have you communicated
with Kepler?

50:04.208 --> 50:07.042
No, the people we encountered
damaged the pod.

50:07.708 --> 50:09.667
Well, the people here,
they're...

50:11.208 --> 50:12.292
hot-headed.

50:13.583 --> 50:15.208
But we still have the biometer.

50:16.958 --> 50:19.875
We developed it on Kepler
to measure biochemical changes.

50:20.167 --> 50:21.875
It's specialised in fertility.

50:22.500 --> 50:24.917
Your men took it.
It must be here somewhere.

50:25.417 --> 50:26.458
Can it transmit?

50:27.792 --> 50:28.958
Not by itself.

50:32.167 --> 50:35.167
I figured I could connect it
to the Ulysses 1's transmitters.

50:39.583 --> 50:42.417
I'm afraid the Ulysses 1
was completely destroyed.

50:47.625 --> 50:48.708
And my father?

51:05.375 --> 51:08.250
The people of Kepler
owe him a huge debt.

51:10.208 --> 51:11.292
What happened?

51:15.208 --> 51:18.292
Shortly after sending
our last status report

51:19.833 --> 51:21.500
we encountered the survivors.

51:22.333 --> 51:24.000
"Muds", we called them.

51:24.167 --> 51:26.167
We were stunned
these people had survived.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.375
Your father, in particular,
was very good with them.

51:30.583 --> 51:34.958
And then, we were waiting for
the next communication window

51:35.625 --> 51:38.458
to send our report to trigger
the Kepler homecoming...

51:41.667 --> 51:44.708
and they rebelled,
erupted in violence

51:44.792 --> 51:47.083
destroyed everything
including the Ulysses 1

51:47.417 --> 51:49.458
our only means
of communication.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.042
It was...

51:52.792 --> 51:53.958
mystifying...

51:54.375 --> 51:56.292
after we'd offered them so much.

51:58.792 --> 52:00.542
Stafford was killed that day...

52:02.000 --> 52:03.375
and so was your father.

52:09.042 --> 52:12.042
It's so dangerous here, we've
been forced to arm ourselves.

52:12.583 --> 52:15.125
We found weapons in one of
the abandoned ships.

52:15.750 --> 52:17.500
But we're running out
of arsenal.

52:17.583 --> 52:18.875
Daddy?

52:19.667 --> 52:21.417
Can I give her a present?

52:24.542 --> 52:25.583
Come.

52:29.875 --> 52:31.458
It's a Space Shuttle.

52:33.583 --> 52:35.917
I had a bit of trouble
with the nose cone.

52:37.875 --> 52:38.917
Very nice, Neil

52:39.083 --> 52:41.583
but off you go now,
with your mother.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.000
He's excited you came.

52:56.333 --> 52:57.625
Is he your son?

52:58.708 --> 52:59.750
I adopted him.

53:00.750 --> 53:02.500
What's the situation on Kepler?

53:02.792 --> 53:03.958
Much worse.

53:04.542 --> 53:06.875
All reproductive technology
efforts failed

53:07.000 --> 53:08.167
for both men and women.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.083
Well...

53:15.208 --> 53:18.042
it's imperative now
that we bring our people

53:18.458 --> 53:20.292
and realise
your father's vision.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.417
How do we handle
Kepler's arrival?

53:26.583 --> 53:29.625
Tide waters, mudflats,
unstable sediment

53:29.708 --> 53:31.375
make it extremely complex.

53:44.833 --> 53:47.250
A dam across
the mouth of the estuary.

53:47.708 --> 53:49.917
This way, we'll finally
hold back the sea.

53:50.875 --> 53:53.125
But the rebellion
set back our progress.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.292
Almost all the work
had to stop.

53:55.792 --> 53:57.042
Are those turbines?

53:59.250 --> 54:02.000
Your father realised the tides
might provide a source of...

54:02.083 --> 54:03.458
Hydroelectricity.

54:05.458 --> 54:07.792
He knew the constant
ebb and flow of the water

54:07.875 --> 54:09.583
could power a whole community.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.167
It's not just for us.

54:12.792 --> 54:16.125
Have you noticed how hardly any
of the Muds is older than 30?

54:16.917 --> 54:18.833
It's the conditions
they live under.

54:18.958 --> 54:21.583
Twice a day,
stricken by mist and tide.

54:23.750 --> 54:26.333
We have to take care
of future generations.

54:26.917 --> 54:28.583
Give them the...

54:29.292 --> 54:31.083
...the chance of civilisation.

54:32.375 --> 54:33.417
Sir?

54:35.875 --> 54:37.083
Cabin is ready.

54:47.583 --> 54:51.083
The shower works,
but the water's a bit cloudy.

54:52.958 --> 54:55.500
Right. I'll leave you
for the night.

54:56.583 --> 54:57.750
Gibson.

55:01.917 --> 55:02.875
Thank you.

55:03.375 --> 55:05.542
I'm so pleased that
you're here with us now.

55:29.333 --> 55:31.000
For the many.

55:31.875 --> 55:33.167
For the many.

55:34.542 --> 55:35.708
For the many.

55:36.292 --> 55:37.917
Carbon dioxide...

55:38.875 --> 55:40.000
oxygen...

55:40.708 --> 55:42.042
water vapour?

55:42.583 --> 55:43.917
Very good, and?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.167
- Nitrogen?
- Nitrogen. Very good.

55:46.375 --> 55:49.625
See that orange glow is made
out of tiny atoms of carbon.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.250
Can you imagine that moment...

55:57.000 --> 55:59.500
when humans
first discovered fire?

56:02.542 --> 56:05.000
Suddenly, we could
control the elements.

57:16.542 --> 57:18.417
I brought you
some fresh clothes.

57:20.500 --> 57:21.667
Thank you.

57:50.708 --> 57:51.875
Children.

57:54.792 --> 57:57.625
We have an incredibly
special visitor today.

57:58.125 --> 58:00.333
Shh, shh, shh!

58:01.500 --> 58:04.708
Children, this is Louise Blake.

58:04.792 --> 58:06.208
Would you like
to say something?

58:06.958 --> 58:10.125
- Welcome, Miss Blake.
- Very good.

58:10.708 --> 58:13.375
We will perform
what we've learnt.

58:14.083 --> 58:15.208
Stand up.

58:17.208 --> 58:20.250
They've waited a long time
to perform for a Kepler.

58:22.292 --> 58:23.208
And...

58:23.750 --> 58:26.708
♪ We were lost, alone in space ♪

58:27.250 --> 58:30.375
♪ So far from home
in airless waste ♪

58:30.958 --> 58:34.333
♪ Alone within
our star-filled dome ♪

58:34.875 --> 58:38.417
♪ No countryside
in which to roam ♪

58:39.042 --> 58:43.000
♪ We endured
that we may endure ♪

58:43.208 --> 58:46.292
♪ To make our destiny secure ♪

58:46.708 --> 58:50.333
♪ To find a land of hope
and plenty ♪

58:50.667 --> 58:53.375
♪ For the many, for the many ♪

58:53.458 --> 58:54.667
Well done, children.

58:54.750 --> 58:55.750
Sit down now.

58:56.208 --> 58:58.292
Do you mind if they ask you
a few questions?

58:58.583 --> 58:59.958
- No, of course.
- Sit.

59:01.667 --> 59:03.250
- Any questions?
- Sir!

59:03.542 --> 59:04.833
- Mr Gibson!
- Damek.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.208
Can you swim on Kepler?

59:07.750 --> 59:10.500
We have simulation pools,
but there's no...

59:11.417 --> 59:12.958
lake or oceans.

59:13.042 --> 59:15.375
- Do you like it here?
- Yes.

59:15.500 --> 59:18.417
I like it here. I mean, it's
a bit wet sometimes, but...

59:20.000 --> 59:23.583
Remember on Kepler, it's dry,
and it's arid, very rocky

59:24.333 --> 59:27.250
so when you go outside,
you need to wear a respirator

59:28.250 --> 59:29.500
and people live

59:29.625 --> 59:31.792
inside these huge...

59:32.292 --> 59:34.042
- Biodomes.
- Well done, Lexi!

59:34.208 --> 59:36.875
Very good. Any more questions?

59:37.458 --> 59:38.708
Do you miss home?

59:44.708 --> 59:47.292
Well, actually, I'm hoping that
this could become my home.

59:47.958 --> 59:49.000
Any more questions?

59:51.542 --> 59:53.167
No, that... that's enough.

59:53.292 --> 59:54.333
That's enough, I think.

59:54.417 --> 59:56.042
What do you want to say,
children?

59:56.292 --> 59:58.750
Thank you, Miss Blake!

1:00:14.333 --> 1:00:15.750
Why aren't you at school?

1:00:16.042 --> 1:00:17.625
I get private lessons.

1:00:27.417 --> 1:00:28.875
Are you good at maths?

1:00:30.542 --> 1:00:31.542
Test me.

1:00:34.583 --> 1:00:37.458
What's 83 times 76?

1:00:38.958 --> 1:00:40.917
6,308.

1:00:49.792 --> 1:00:52.542
What's 67 times 54?

1:00:54.708 --> 1:00:56.792
3,618.

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.583
Do you want to know a secret?

1:01:29.792 --> 1:01:31.542
It's called a "tree".

1:01:40.125 --> 1:01:42.625
Do you know, they used to be
as big as me...

1:01:44.458 --> 1:01:45.750
and everywhere?

1:01:48.917 --> 1:01:50.042
Imagine...

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.083
- Who taught you this?
- What?

1:01:55.167 --> 1:01:56.250
The tree.

1:01:59.875 --> 1:02:01.417
Christopher Columbus.

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:06.917
He lives in a cabin
next to the engine room.

1:02:09.292 --> 1:02:11.792
I talk to him
through the pipes.

1:02:14.458 --> 1:02:15.500
Show me.

1:02:17.417 --> 1:02:19.000
I'm not allowed to go there.

1:04:03.792 --> 1:04:05.458
I'm sorry I lied to you.

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:10.417
Why is he in there?

1:04:12.083 --> 1:04:14.208
- Give me a chance to explain.
- Just tell me why?

1:04:20.458 --> 1:04:22.167
The rebellion I told you about.

1:04:23.667 --> 1:04:25.917
It wasn't the Muds who led it,
it was your father.

1:04:28.250 --> 1:04:29.958
- You're lying.
- No, Blake.

1:04:31.708 --> 1:04:32.958
Why would he do that?

1:04:35.208 --> 1:04:36.417
He fell in love...

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:39.958
with a Mud woman.

1:04:42.167 --> 1:04:44.000
Forgot whose side he was on,
I guess.

1:04:50.667 --> 1:04:51.750
Open the door.

1:05:26.625 --> 1:05:27.625
Papa.

1:05:28.042 --> 1:05:29.167
Louise.

1:05:31.125 --> 1:05:32.375
Oh, Louise.

1:05:39.292 --> 1:05:41.375
I missed you so much.

1:05:51.667 --> 1:05:52.875
Louise...

1:05:56.875 --> 1:05:58.000
I'm sorry.

1:05:59.333 --> 1:06:00.375
Papa.

1:06:05.750 --> 1:06:06.917
Is it true?

1:06:10.333 --> 1:06:11.583
You betrayed us?

1:06:20.792 --> 1:06:22.958
Fifteen years I waited
to hear from you.

1:06:23.375 --> 1:06:25.500
I did everything to be sent
on this mission

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:27.417
just to know what had
happened to you.

1:06:28.375 --> 1:06:29.708
And you gave up on me?

1:06:32.375 --> 1:06:33.375
I did.

1:06:35.667 --> 1:06:37.083
You gave up on Kepler?

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:41.083
Why?

1:06:43.292 --> 1:06:44.500
I had to stop it.

1:06:46.167 --> 1:06:48.250
- Stop what?
- The mistakes.

1:06:52.542 --> 1:06:53.750
I don't understand.

1:06:56.500 --> 1:06:58.167
Can't you see
what's going on here?

1:07:04.083 --> 1:07:05.875
Kepler shouldn't come back,
Louise.

1:07:06.333 --> 1:07:08.250
None of us
should have come back.

1:07:14.333 --> 1:07:15.417
Louise!

1:07:38.375 --> 1:07:41.083
He ruined everything we'd
worked so hard to achieve.

1:07:42.708 --> 1:07:45.833
In the end, nothing changes
the fact he's still from Kepler.

1:07:48.750 --> 1:07:50.083
That's the Henderson Hub?

1:07:53.167 --> 1:07:55.125
They wanted to
destroy that, too.

1:07:55.458 --> 1:07:56.667
But we stopped them.

1:07:58.500 --> 1:07:59.917
I'll transmit from there.

1:08:00.417 --> 1:08:02.042
It's just a weather station.

1:08:02.708 --> 1:08:04.083
But it's intact, right?

1:08:04.833 --> 1:08:06.708
I could connect
the biometer to it.

1:08:08.458 --> 1:08:09.667
And send what?

1:08:09.875 --> 1:08:12.583
Kepler wants proof that
we could procreate here.

1:08:16.957 --> 1:08:19.375
It looks like my TSH levels
have recovered.

1:08:24.917 --> 1:08:26.582
We'll find the biometer.

1:08:27.667 --> 1:08:29.000
I'll send Paling now.

1:08:32.332 --> 1:08:34.832
Our predecessors failed us
in so many ways

1:08:35.457 --> 1:08:38.125
but this was one of
their greatest inventions.

1:08:45.832 --> 1:08:47.957
- For the many.
- For the many.

1:08:57.750 --> 1:08:58.957
Again?

1:08:59.167 --> 1:09:00.625
- Soup!
- Neil.

1:09:03.667 --> 1:09:04.832
<i>Dyen korse.</i>

1:09:05.832 --> 1:09:07.875
I'm still learning
their language.

1:09:08.417 --> 1:09:10.332
The vocabulary is remarkable.
They have...

1:09:10.667 --> 1:09:12.500
thirteen different words
for water.

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:14.417
Fourteen, Daddy.

1:09:14.750 --> 1:09:16.625
It depends on what it does.

1:09:17.042 --> 1:09:18.667
Saltwater.

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.500
Drinking water.

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:23.042
- Floodwater...
- You know what, Neil?

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:25.625
You should be our interpreter
when they come.

1:09:25.750 --> 1:09:27.832
I don't want to be
an interpreter.

1:09:27.917 --> 1:09:31.875
I want to be an astronaut,
saving people's lives.

1:09:32.082 --> 1:09:35.167
You're thinking of a superhero,
not an astronaut.

1:09:35.457 --> 1:09:36.957
He found some old comics.

1:09:37.542 --> 1:09:39.250
But you saved my life.

1:09:40.957 --> 1:09:42.707
Your favourite story, isn't it?

1:09:44.542 --> 1:09:47.250
Munay, why don't you
tell it to Blake?

1:09:53.167 --> 1:09:55.042
When I delivered Neil

1:09:56.083 --> 1:09:57.167
his...

1:09:58.333 --> 1:09:59.500
"Naelsnora"?

1:10:00.542 --> 1:10:01.833
Umbilical cord.

1:10:04.833 --> 1:10:06.875
It was wrapped around his neck.

1:10:08.375 --> 1:10:10.542
Out there, in the ocean

1:10:10.625 --> 1:10:13.375
both Neil and I
would be dead now.

1:10:16.708 --> 1:10:18.958
This man saved our life.

1:10:20.417 --> 1:10:23.792
He cut my stomach open,
got the baby out

1:10:24.792 --> 1:10:26.042
treated my wounds.

1:10:26.708 --> 1:10:29.000
And then he made us
into his family.

1:10:29.583 --> 1:10:31.375
Dramatic way to start a family.

1:10:32.917 --> 1:10:35.042
- Fish balls!
- Neil...

1:10:36.583 --> 1:10:37.542
No, Neil!

1:10:38.750 --> 1:10:40.208
Use a knife and fork.

1:10:41.167 --> 1:10:43.083
You're a civilised human being,
for God's sake.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.292
Oh, don't worry,
it's just a blackout.

1:10:50.042 --> 1:10:51.542
Happens from time to time.

1:10:57.458 --> 1:11:00.167
Sir, we were looking
for the biometer

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:01.708
when there
has been an intrusion.

1:11:01.792 --> 1:11:03.417
Someone took out the guards
by the generators

1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:04.667
and killed the power.

1:11:05.208 --> 1:11:06.583
Secure this floor.

1:11:06.708 --> 1:11:08.583
Have all guards check
every entrance.

1:11:08.917 --> 1:11:10.292
- Yes, sir.
- You take Neil

1:11:10.375 --> 1:11:11.458
lock yourself in.

1:11:11.750 --> 1:11:12.750
Mummy?

1:11:13.083 --> 1:11:15.667
- I'll check the corridors.
- You're safest in your room.

1:11:17.625 --> 1:11:18.708
That's an order.

1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:44.792
Maila, where is she?

1:11:45.250 --> 1:11:46.417
Where is she?

1:11:47.417 --> 1:11:48.667
Take me to her.

1:11:50.417 --> 1:11:51.417
Alright.

1:11:52.250 --> 1:11:53.375
OK.

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:22.250
Maila?

1:12:26.167 --> 1:12:27.292
<i>Huej!</i>

1:12:27.667 --> 1:12:29.208
<i>Naskiratsi tsi strap pissot!</i>

1:12:30.125 --> 1:12:31.458
- <i>Huej!</i>
- Maila!

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:34.375
Ma! Ma!

1:12:36.125 --> 1:12:37.125
Mama!

1:12:38.042 --> 1:12:39.500
Mama!

1:12:39.708 --> 1:12:41.875
<i>Lemnach ma Mama ensama!</i>

1:12:42.292 --> 1:12:44.875
What the fuck
is going on here? Enough!

1:12:46.667 --> 1:12:47.750
Ma!

1:12:52.417 --> 1:12:54.375
Narvik.

1:12:55.083 --> 1:12:56.667
- Stop!
- Mama!

1:12:56.750 --> 1:12:58.458
Stop it! You stop it!

1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.125
Mama!

1:13:00.333 --> 1:13:01.500
What did you say?

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.375
Take this thing away.

1:13:06.667 --> 1:13:09.042
<i>Lemnach ma Mama ensama!</i>

1:13:09.375 --> 1:13:11.792
<i>Lemnach ma Mama ensama!</i>

1:13:14.083 --> 1:13:15.417
They only take the girls.

1:13:20.167 --> 1:13:22.292
Mama! Mama!

1:13:24.333 --> 1:13:25.833
Mama!

1:13:26.333 --> 1:13:27.500
Are you OK?

1:13:46.042 --> 1:13:47.208
You will be fine.

1:13:50.750 --> 1:13:52.917
- What will happen to her?
- Shh.

1:13:54.167 --> 1:13:55.958
Better if we are not talking.

1:14:28.875 --> 1:14:30.292
You have his eyes.

1:14:33.833 --> 1:14:35.167
How's the throat?

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:48.542
I'll survive.

1:14:49.542 --> 1:14:51.625
I'm sorry you got
caught up in all this.

1:14:52.708 --> 1:14:54.750
Narvik has quite a temper.

1:14:55.292 --> 1:14:56.500
You know her name?

1:14:57.208 --> 1:14:59.417
She was one of the guards
who turned against us.

1:15:04.167 --> 1:15:05.333
They hate us.

1:15:07.333 --> 1:15:08.917
She just wanted her daughter.

1:15:11.375 --> 1:15:12.958
She's a Kepler daughter now.

1:15:17.667 --> 1:15:18.875
Why only girls?

1:15:21.208 --> 1:15:22.375
Let me ask you this.

1:15:23.667 --> 1:15:26.667
What's the average age
of our females back home?

1:15:27.458 --> 1:15:30.208
Maybe late, mid-40s?

1:15:31.167 --> 1:15:32.833
Assuming they leave now

1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:34.958
most of them will be
in their 50s

1:15:35.042 --> 1:15:36.417
by the time they arrive.

1:15:37.125 --> 1:15:38.667
Do the maths, Blake.

1:15:39.208 --> 1:15:41.417
Even if their fertility
is restored

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:43.875
it'll be too late
for most of them to conceive.

1:15:44.958 --> 1:15:47.833
We need a diverse
and vigorous gene pool.

1:15:47.917 --> 1:15:49.167
They are children.

1:15:49.958 --> 1:15:52.417
They won't be by the time
our people arrive.

1:15:55.667 --> 1:15:57.083
So is this our mission?

1:15:57.708 --> 1:15:59.833
To ensure we don't die out?
Absolutely.

1:16:00.208 --> 1:16:01.708
In case you didn't notice,
Gibson

1:16:01.792 --> 1:16:03.833
the human race doesn't
actually need us to survive.

1:16:03.917 --> 1:16:05.458
You sound just
like your father.

1:16:06.542 --> 1:16:07.833
They're not like us.

1:16:08.833 --> 1:16:11.208
We can repopulate our planet.

1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:14.417
Our current predicament

1:16:15.167 --> 1:16:17.042
calls for a measure
of expediency.

1:16:17.667 --> 1:16:19.708
If you have an alternative,
please...

1:16:20.583 --> 1:16:21.625
enlighten me.

1:16:28.167 --> 1:16:29.208
Paling.

1:16:29.708 --> 1:16:30.958
It was on the tugboat.

1:16:31.667 --> 1:16:32.750
Thank you.

1:16:35.125 --> 1:16:38.167
Now, Paling is a perfect
example of a Mud

1:16:38.250 --> 1:16:40.208
who worked out
what's best for him.

1:16:46.583 --> 1:16:47.708
Where is it?

1:16:48.875 --> 1:16:50.458
- Where is it?
- It must be back at the camp.

1:16:50.583 --> 1:16:52.125
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Shut up!

1:16:56.167 --> 1:16:59.000
When the tide comes in,
you and Paling...

1:16:59.583 --> 1:17:02.458
you're gonna go back there
and find the damn thing.

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:07.500
And Narvik?

1:17:12.458 --> 1:17:14.208
She'll be executed at dawn.

1:17:19.792 --> 1:17:21.583
Are you still with us, Blake?

1:17:26.375 --> 1:17:27.458
Yes, sir.

1:17:32.583 --> 1:17:33.917
Keep an eye on her.

1:17:43.375 --> 1:17:44.500
What's that?

1:18:10.125 --> 1:18:11.750
Hey.

1:18:11.833 --> 1:18:13.167
What are you doing here?

1:18:14.958 --> 1:18:16.083
Blake!

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:34.792
Listen to me.

1:18:37.125 --> 1:18:38.625
We're gonna find your mother.

1:18:40.333 --> 1:18:41.292
Ma?

1:18:41.375 --> 1:18:42.458
Yes, Ma.

1:18:42.542 --> 1:18:45.125
Open the door!

1:18:46.167 --> 1:18:48.333
It's alright. Just wait here.

1:18:51.083 --> 1:18:52.250
Stay there.

1:18:55.792 --> 1:18:57.792
Captain's order, open!

1:19:07.708 --> 1:19:08.958
I have to search your cabin.

1:19:11.042 --> 1:19:12.542
One of the girls is missing.

1:20:08.458 --> 1:20:09.500
I'm curious.

1:20:11.417 --> 1:20:13.292
What was it like
being on Kepler...

1:20:14.375 --> 1:20:15.583
with no one?

1:20:17.167 --> 1:20:19.458
Must make a woman hungry...

1:20:20.750 --> 1:20:22.250
to feel life inside.

1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:31.583
Have a seat.

1:20:43.333 --> 1:20:44.458
Come.

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:19.667
Paling!

1:21:55.417 --> 1:21:56.458
Let's go.

1:22:34.792 --> 1:22:36.208
<i>Varidi es hou heir?</i>

1:22:36.708 --> 1:22:39.833
<i>Con vous yjelp mezure
fjyend dai tochlett?</i>

1:22:43.250 --> 1:22:44.500
<i>Vous net hier!</i>

1:22:45.417 --> 1:22:46.875
<i>No vous fier! No vous...</i>

1:23:15.667 --> 1:23:16.625
Ma!

1:23:18.167 --> 1:23:19.292
Maila!

1:23:49.917 --> 1:23:50.958
Come!

1:24:06.292 --> 1:24:08.208
Mama? Mama?

1:24:19.750 --> 1:24:21.042
Let's get out of here.

1:24:23.250 --> 1:24:24.292
Louise.

1:24:26.708 --> 1:24:29.042
What's going on here?
Come and see this.

1:24:34.417 --> 1:24:35.875
Why are they going there?

1:24:38.250 --> 1:24:39.750
Gibson never leaves the ship.

1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:41.417
Never.

1:24:48.542 --> 1:24:49.792
How did you get this?

1:24:53.917 --> 1:24:56.542
It's Neil.
He sends me surprises.

1:25:01.917 --> 1:25:03.500
It was in there all the time.

1:25:04.042 --> 1:25:05.625
What? What was?

1:25:06.708 --> 1:25:07.833
The biometer.

1:25:09.750 --> 1:25:11.917
They want the proof
that we can procreate here.

1:25:14.708 --> 1:25:16.000
But there's none on there.

1:25:16.458 --> 1:25:17.917
No. No!

1:25:19.250 --> 1:25:21.500
He has the proof.
He has it with him.

1:25:21.583 --> 1:25:24.583
- What do you mean? What proof?
- Neil is the proof.

1:25:26.042 --> 1:25:27.958
Neil is a Kepler.

1:25:28.792 --> 1:25:31.458
Whatever Gibson told you,
it's a lie.

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:37.458
We have to stop him.

1:25:39.708 --> 1:25:41.083
You have to stop him.

1:25:43.375 --> 1:25:44.458
Louise.

1:26:04.583 --> 1:26:05.708
Louise?

1:26:09.708 --> 1:26:11.333
I never lit the last one.

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.000
Come!

1:27:26.208 --> 1:27:27.583
Come!

1:27:34.417 --> 1:27:35.458
Go!

1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:14.542
Stop it!

1:29:15.917 --> 1:29:18.208
- No, please!
- Drop the gun!

1:29:18.458 --> 1:29:20.917
- Please!
- He's your own flesh and blood.

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:23.458
Please!

1:29:23.542 --> 1:29:25.000
- Tell her!
- It's true!

1:29:25.542 --> 1:29:26.917
He's your brother.

1:29:32.125 --> 1:29:33.333
Drop the gun.

1:29:36.125 --> 1:29:37.792
- You don't think I'll do it?
- No!

1:29:38.083 --> 1:29:39.417
No, please, Gibson!

1:29:39.542 --> 1:29:40.833
No! No!

1:29:42.750 --> 1:29:43.792
Mama!

1:29:44.500 --> 1:29:45.667
Drop the gun.

1:29:47.708 --> 1:29:49.375
- Drop it!
- Mama!

1:29:59.625 --> 1:30:00.833
No, Mama!

1:30:01.167 --> 1:30:02.333
Mama!

1:30:15.375 --> 1:30:16.542
It's sent!

1:31:38.083 --> 1:31:39.500
Wake up!

1:31:58.167 --> 1:32:00.542
Wake up!

1:32:13.667 --> 1:32:14.667
Blake.

1:33:37.208 --> 1:33:38.583
Go to him, Louise.

1:33:39.625 --> 1:33:41.042
He trusts you.

1:33:51.375 --> 1:33:52.375
Hey...

1:33:58.792 --> 1:34:00.000
Can I sit down?

1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:20.583
My father got this
from his father.

1:34:22.042 --> 1:34:24.292
He told me it must be
handled with care.

1:34:28.458 --> 1:34:29.708
Now it's yours.

1:34:40.042 --> 1:34:42.208
He must have named you
after one of them.

1:35:02.625 --> 1:35:03.792
Are they coming?

1:35:06.375 --> 1:35:07.542
Maybe.
