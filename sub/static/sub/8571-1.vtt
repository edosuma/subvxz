00:15.040 --> 00:18.522
<i>In other news, Chuckie Sol,
a made man in the Black Mask Mob</i>

00:18.680 --> 00:22.366
<i>was kidnapped at gunpoint
by masked assailants earlier today.</i>

00:22.520 --> 00:26.206
<i>Suspicion is high that Sol was
a victim of the recent turf war</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.647
<i>raging between the Mob
and a new rival gang</i>

00:28.840 --> 00:30.080
<i>composed of high-tech criminals</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:32.168
<i>known to have crossed paths with Batman.</i>

00:33.480 --> 00:35.240
I don't know about
any weapon shipment, Tusk.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.486
Mask don't tell us...

00:37.840 --> 00:39.683
You could do
better than that, Chuckie.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.285
We ain't got all night.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.121
Old Electrocutioner here
gets mighty ticked when someone lies.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.120
When is that weapons shipment due?

01:12.320 --> 01:13.321
Wait...

01:13.960 --> 01:15.849
Batman doesn't use guns.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.481
Batman doesn't.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.766
But I do.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.531
I'm just the accountant.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.721
Shut it!

01:58.040 --> 01:59.804
That's no way to treat a lady.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.530
I could've handled
these C-listers on my own.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.887
Dressing like a bat
doesn't make you a hero.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.451
It just makes you a target.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.281
And using a gun makes you just like them.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.121
I want you out of here.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.281
Now!

03:05.480 --> 03:06.481
Whoa!

03:31.280 --> 03:32.281
Down!

03:41.960 --> 03:44.486
This wasn't a break-in. Was it, Firefly?

03:45.320 --> 03:46.651
Of course not.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.484
They're working for someone new.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.641
Who?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.208
This is truly an honor, Batman.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.966
I've waited so very long for this moment.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.324
Though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.167
Do I know you?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.171
Intimately.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.481
And not at all.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.806
And you rag on me for stealing your look.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.371
Onyx, now.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.889
Rest well, Batman.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.089
<i>It's not like he punches a time clock,</i>

06:02.240 --> 06:04.481
<i>but I can assure you
that the Gotham Police Force</i>

06:04.640 --> 06:07.450
<i>is more than capable of
keeping this city safe.</i>

06:07.880 --> 06:09.962
<i>Even without a masked hero to back us up.</i>

06:13.440 --> 06:15.408
You're a bad liar, Gordon.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.400
<i>So, are on your way?</i>

06:31.480 --> 06:33.528
Yeah, babe. You can't believe the traffic.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.680
<i>It's Blockbuster!</i>

06:44.440 --> 06:45.965
<i>Can't wait to see you.</i>

06:46.120 --> 06:47.929
<i>It's been weeks, Dick.</i>

06:48.440 --> 06:50.807
<i>I've almost forgotten what you feel like.</i>

06:50.960 --> 06:51.961
I'll remind...

06:55.760 --> 06:56.761
<i>It's...</i>

06:56.920 --> 06:57.921
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

06:58.120 --> 06:59.121
Construction.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.685
Hold on, I think I see an opening.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.327
Huh?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.803
Yup. All clear, Kori.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.400
I'll be at the tower in...

07:16.840 --> 07:19.286
Babe, you have no idea
how sorry I am, but...

07:20.040 --> 07:22.281
<i>- But what about our...</i>
- Got a family emergency.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.441
Nightwing out.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.928
Your timing really sucks, Alfred.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.285
<i>Well, your trip to
the rainforest seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne.</i>

07:43.480 --> 07:45.448
With the World Tech Summit coming up...

07:45.600 --> 07:47.568
<i>It's not for another week, Ms. Bannister.</i>

07:47.720 --> 07:49.404
<i>We're down here studying rare herbs</i>

07:49.560 --> 07:51.881
<i>that could prove revolutionary
for medical research.</i>

07:52.040 --> 07:55.010
And earn millions for
our pharmaceutical interests.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.164
All well and good.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.891
But why did you have to lead the team?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.570
<i>Because it's my company.</i>

08:01.720 --> 08:04.007
<i>And I can do whatever
the bloody hell I want to.</i>

08:04.480 --> 08:07.211
<i>You still have to
answer to this board, Mr. Wayne.</i>

08:07.360 --> 08:10.011
<i>- And frankly...</i>
- I think we're done here.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.969
If any of you have further concerns,

08:12.400 --> 08:13.845
bring them to Lucius.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.049
He's more than capable
of handling things while I'm gone.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.530
Oh, dear.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.360
<i>I'd watch those "bloody hells," governor.</i>

08:28.080 --> 08:29.206
Don't want to be giving yourself away.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.487
Master Dick.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.688
It's bad manners
to sneak up on a person like that.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.080
Sneaking up on people is
kind of what we do around here, Alfred.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.760
That's a joke.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.724
We are not amused.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.527
I'm not exactly in a festive mood either.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.761
How long has he been gone?

08:49.960 --> 08:53.646
Two weeks, one day, 15 hours.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.051
Wouldn't be the first time.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.967
But he's never been gone this long
without notifying me in some way.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.805
Last night, the signal was up for an hour.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.485
Third time this week.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.007
And if the police are
aware of his absence,

09:08.160 --> 09:11.130
then you can be certain
the criminal class is as well.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.322
<i>There's already been a sharp uptick
in underworld activities.</i>

09:16.120 --> 09:18.327
<i>If Batman doesn't return soon...</i>

09:18.480 --> 09:19.481
I know.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.722
All bloody hell's gonna break loose.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.205
Even when you've disappeared,
I can't get away from you.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.286
Mr. Fox.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.329
I think it's way past time we...

09:33.480 --> 09:34.925
Apologies, Ms. Bannister.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.845
I have an important visitor
who simply can't wait.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.321
Huh! That woman!

09:44.520 --> 09:45.646
What's wrong, Dad?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.802
Bannister's been barking at you for years.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.530
You never let her get under your skin.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.889
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.403
Come on. Let's get some grub.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.489
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel, Luke.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.483
Too much on my plate right here.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.640
Of course, if you'd finally
accept Mr. Wayne's offer,

10:02.800 --> 10:04.040
we could do lunch every day.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.201
Dad...

10:05.360 --> 10:07.488
With your background in physics and math...

10:07.640 --> 10:09.847
- Dad...
- You'd be an extraordinary asset.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.121
Dad!

10:11.600 --> 10:14.683
I said no before I went into the service
and it's still no.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.241
Why?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.846
You're the one who told me
to follow my own path.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.686
Yes.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.771
But I never thought
it would take you to Afghanistan.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.286
<i>I thought your doctor told you
to give that up.</i>

10:50.360 --> 10:52.249
I've decided to live dangerously.

10:52.760 --> 10:53.807
Like my daughter.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.081
As I recall,

10:55.240 --> 10:58.130
I picked up the art of dangerous living
from you, Colonel Kane.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.281
How are you, Dad?

10:59.440 --> 11:01.761
I'm more concerned with how you are, Kate.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.445
I haven't seen you in weeks.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.802
I was hoping you'd met some nice girl.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.726
I've been trying to find out something,
anything, about my mystery man.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.281
And...

11:13.480 --> 11:15.244
It's like he doesn't even exist.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.771
What about his friends?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.810
Vanished without a trace.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.088
I watched that place blow apart, Dad.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.566
There was no way he could've escaped.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.291
And I keep wondering
if there was something...

11:26.440 --> 11:28.124
Anything that I could've done.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.724
Are you sure he's dead, Kate?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.962
This is Batman we're talking about.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.124
No one could've survived that.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.849
I need your help on this one.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.528
Your mother always thought
you'd be an artist.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.441
Elizabeth was the one
with the real talent.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.842
Katey. Are you okay?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.321
Kate?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.321
Huh?

12:05.840 --> 12:08.684
I'll see what my network can dig up
on your mystery man.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.047
They keep hoping
for an answer, don't they?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.121
Why don't you give them one?

12:15.280 --> 12:16.361
Not my style.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.161
It seems reports of his death
have been greatly

12:33.160 --> 12:34.321
exaggerated.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.686
Watch your back, Kate.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.248
New guy thinks he can move in.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.563
I'm gonna show those punks
who's top dog around here.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.729
Gotham's my bitch.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.729
<i>Which makes you mine, Mask.</i>

12:59.200 --> 13:01.009
You're supposed to be dead.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.685
<i>Let me fix that for you.</i>

13:21.800 --> 13:22.881
Damn it!

13:27.960 --> 13:30.804
I bet 50 grand
that you were dead this time.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.521
You lost.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.041
Always bet on black.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.161
Robin?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.243
<i>Somebody kill this freaking kid!</i>

14:06.240 --> 14:07.366
Damian?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.481
What?

14:54.040 --> 14:55.644
I could've handled this alone.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.810
If that's your best Batman,
you're not gonna fool anyone,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.001
Grayson.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.686
Maybe you'd like a megaphone
to announce that?

15:12.520 --> 15:14.966
There's no way you're gonna
pull this off without my help.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.481
Modest as ever, I see.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.648
I'm more Batman than you'll ever be.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.086
Just follow my lead.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.881
We're being tailed.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.044
You've been tracking me all night.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.531
I want to know why.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.609
First, tell me why you're
running around Gotham playing dress-up.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.764
I'm guessing Nightwing?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.171
Hmm! Busted.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.409
Actually, I think he's more than capable
of fooling most people.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.484
And you're certainly not gonna
pass for Batman, short stack.

16:13.880 --> 16:14.881
Who the hell are you?

16:15.040 --> 16:16.280
Easy, Robin.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.281
Tell me what you want
and why you've been following me.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.169
I just had to make sure.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.448
You see, I was there
the night Batman died.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.963
<i>He threw me clear and saved my life.</i>

16:30.120 --> 16:33.203
But before I could
get back up here it blew apart.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.244
And we're just supposed to believe that?

16:37.400 --> 16:38.686
Believe what you want.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.046
I don't trust her.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.964
Oh, but you did trust Talon.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.161
Shut up.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.886
Who was it?
Who were Tusk and Firefly working for?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.041
I don't know.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.568
But when I find out,
I'll drop a note in your lunchbox.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.884
If you're serious about hunting them down,
then we should work together.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.605
Just because I wear this,

16:57.760 --> 16:59.888
doesn't mean
I'm a part of your little cult.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.482
You really have a way with women, Grayson.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.250
Do you think he's really dead?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.445
I don't know.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.971
You'd like it, wouldn't you?

17:22.119 --> 17:23.645
If he never came back?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.404
Then you get to keep that suit.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.246
I've struggled for years
to get out of Bruce's shadow,

17:35.400 --> 17:39.007
to build a life for myself
as far away from his world as possible.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.645
And the last thing I want

17:40.800 --> 17:42.928
is to be wearing this damn thing!

17:44.640 --> 17:45.641
<i>Um...</i>

17:45.800 --> 17:50.010
<i>I've finally managed to locate
Master Bruce's files on Batwoman.</i>

17:50.160 --> 17:51.446
How come I never heard of her?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.927
<i>She's kept a rather low profile.</i>

17:54.160 --> 17:55.889
Not low enough for Batman, I'll bet.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.482
<i>Investigative report on Batwoman,
aka Katherine Kane.</i>

18:01.840 --> 18:02.841
Katey?

18:03.600 --> 18:04.681
You know her?

18:05.120 --> 18:06.929
<i>Her father is Colonel Jacob Kane.</i>

18:07.080 --> 18:08.320
<i>Military intelligence.</i>

18:08.800 --> 18:13.044
<i>On Katherine's 12th birthday, she and
her twin sister Elizabeth were abducted,</i>

18:13.200 --> 18:15.089
<i>along with their mother, Gabrielle,</i>

18:15.280 --> 18:16.520
<i>and held for ransom.</i>

18:17.000 --> 18:20.004
<i>Colonel Kane led a rescue mission
that saved Kate's life.</i>

18:20.560 --> 18:24.360
<i>But in the attempt, both Gabrielle
and Elizabeth were murdered.</i>

18:24.840 --> 18:28.049
<i>She would follow in her father's
footsteps, enrolling at West Point,</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:30.084
<i>but ultimately expelled.</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:31.810
<i>Something broke inside Kate.</i>

18:32.520 --> 18:35.046
<i>Two years later,
Katherine emerged as Batwoman.</i>

18:35.520 --> 18:36.681
<i>She's impressive,</i>

18:36.880 --> 18:38.803
<i>but her methods make her
a danger to this city.</i>

18:39.360 --> 18:40.725
<i>And to herself.</i>

18:40.880 --> 18:44.043
<i>It's time for me to decide if
I'm going to take her under my wing.</i>

18:46.280 --> 18:47.805
<i>Or take her down.</i>

18:50.720 --> 18:51.960
Poor Katey.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.407
It always begins with death.
Doesn't it, Alfred?

18:54.560 --> 18:57.086
<i>I'm as astonished as you are, Master Dick.</i>

18:57.840 --> 18:59.569
Anyone mind filling me in?

18:59.720 --> 19:00.721
How do you know her?

19:01.400 --> 19:02.561
I just do.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.448
I had to dig very deep, my dear,

19:17.600 --> 19:21.082
reach out to contacts
that even I find somewhat unsavory.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.760
But here he is, your mystery man.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.606
The Heretic.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.842
That's his accomplice. Onyx.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.646
Heretic?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.006
What kind of name is that?

19:31.360 --> 19:33.249
One that invokes disbelief.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.204
His accomplishments certainly do.

19:35.920 --> 19:40.005
<i>In the last 10 months, he has quietly
forged some dangerous alliances,</i>

19:40.160 --> 19:42.845
as well as become a thorn
in the side of Black Mask.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.482
He may have gathered half
the criminals in Gotham under his command.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.761
But who is he?

19:48.040 --> 19:50.566
All I know is,
that he's left a trail of empty vaults

19:50.720 --> 19:53.087
and dead bodies across this city.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.368
And as your experience attests,

19:55.520 --> 19:58.126
he seems to have a fixation with Batman.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.760
With all due respect, Dad,
that doesn't help much.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.281
I'm sorry.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.727
I just need to figure this out on my own.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.090
I'll see you back at the house.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.845
Don't worry, Kate.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.650
I won't let you down again.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.928
If you're gonna keep standing
me up for dinner, Dad,

20:27.120 --> 20:28.201
you could at least call.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.489
God. Luke, I'm sorry.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.926
I'm just swamped.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.291
It's not just the summit, is it?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.041
Excuse me?

20:41.200 --> 20:43.600
This has something to do
with the fact that Batman's missing.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.921
Batman?

20:45.960 --> 20:49.089
Dad, you've been bringing me here
since I was a kid.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.844
I've seen enough over the years
to figure out

20:51.000 --> 20:54.004
that there's some connection
between Wayne Enterprises and Batman.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.845
Somehow I missed that
in the last stockholder's report.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.163
In fact, if I was gonna
make an educated guess,

21:00.360 --> 21:02.328
I'd say you supply him
with some of his tech.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.131
That's some theory.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.441
Dad, I just...

21:29.960 --> 21:32.122
It's coming from Wayne Tech. The vault.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.210
Don't play games with me.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.249
I don't know about any vault.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.047
Fine.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.601
Kill him.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.487
Get us into the vault, Mr. Fox,

22:05.680 --> 22:08.047
or your son becomes a memory.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.761
Stop!

22:37.760 --> 22:40.764
Ooh, look at all these magnificent toys.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.371
You know what we need, Kuttler.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.804
Yes. A fleet of trucks,
so we can take it all.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.569
But for now,
the components will have to do.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.565
How could you know?

23:07.080 --> 23:09.924
This is the 21st century, Mr. Fox.

23:10.080 --> 23:13.129
There are no secrets
in this world anymore.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.481
Dad!

23:19.200 --> 23:21.487
Except the ones we take to our graves.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.047
Ahhh!

23:56.600 --> 23:59.683
You dare to wear the mantle of the Bat?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.565
Get to the transport.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.527
The boy.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.010
Ahhh!

24:34.600 --> 24:36.170
Electrocutioner, stop!

24:36.960 --> 24:39.725
You're gonna fry up real good,
you stupid little...

24:45.160 --> 24:47.731
Come back and fight, you cowards!

24:59.480 --> 25:01.130
- Damn it.
<i>- Help!</i>

25:02.760 --> 25:04.091
He needs an ambulance.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.324
You want more, Bruce?

25:15.720 --> 25:17.848
Don't take it all for yourself.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.281
Don't worry, ladies.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.568
Plenty of me to go around.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.000
Mother's pearls?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.286
Where did you get those?

25:28.440 --> 25:29.771
Where did you get them?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.645
What the hell is this?

26:47.560 --> 26:48.641
Ah!

26:48.800 --> 26:50.848
Still no progress, Tetch?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.089
So much memory.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.685
So much experience.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.602
It's a delicate job,
threading my way through the layers.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.122
You, on the other hand,
could be reprogrammed in an hour.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.882
You're like wet sand,
compared to this concrete.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.883
His trauma runs so deep.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.211
<i>It's as if he defines himself by his pain.</i>

27:12.000 --> 27:13.286
Such madness.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.687
- Huh?
- You have to dig deeper.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.690
Push past the trauma.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.965
To the child he was,
before he lost his precious parents.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.449
Then, you'll break him.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.528
And then, he'll be ours.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.126
You make it sound so easy, Talia.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.689
Easier than dying, Mr. Tetch.

27:43.280 --> 27:47.410
We had the detonators.
But the Bat was there, waiting for us.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.681
Grayson.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.046
Not just him.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.401
The boy.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.601
Of course.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.161
He was nearly killed, but I saved him.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.930
I saved him.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.650
I would expect no less.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.771
We should capture Damian. Bring him here.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.649
I prefer to keep my son at arm's length.

28:06.800 --> 28:07.801
For now.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.685
But if we remove him
from the battle till it's over, then...

28:10.840 --> 28:12.444
I've told you, no.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.241
I know why you want the boy, Heretic.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.645
I'd stay away from that rabbit hole,
if I were you.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.288
Mind your own business, Tetch.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.127
Nothing would give me more pleasure.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.520
I'm so sorry, Luke.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.604
That's all you have to say?

28:45.240 --> 28:47.163
I was in the vault, Dick. I know.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.441
Listen, I don't think this is the time.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.163
My dad might feel differently,

28:54.320 --> 28:55.481
if he could talk.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.249
I came home from one war,
only to walk right into another one.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.171
And I want to be a part of it.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.366
Best way to help is right here,
at your father's side.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.601
I'm a soldier, Dick.

29:09.760 --> 29:10.761
I need to be on the front lines,

29:10.920 --> 29:13.844
not stuck in some lab or boardroom
or freakin' bedside chair.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.651
And last night,
I saw the weapons that could help me.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.083
Weapons that my dad created
and almost got killed for.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.881
No, Luke, listen.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.089
I understand, I really do,
but it's not my call.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.523
Not right now. Things are complicated.
Trust me, okay?

29:31.840 --> 29:33.126
- Dick...
- Alfred.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.525
I'm on it.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.887
I got to run. I'm sorry.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.367
God, I haven't laughed
like that in so long.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.405
I noticed you looked pretty miserable
when you came in.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.925
One of those days?

30:02.120 --> 30:03.690
One of those lives.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.331
Excuse me!

30:08.640 --> 30:10.324
So, you're a cop?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.891
A detective.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.684
You have a problem with that?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.008
No, not at all.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.881
You just don't look the part.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.089
What's a cop supposed to look like?

30:24.720 --> 30:25.926
Not as hot as you.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.847
Did I just say that out loud?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.764
Uh... Yeah, you did.

30:30.920 --> 30:31.921
You're good.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.605
Actually, I'm terrible.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.280
I haven't dated in over a year and I...

30:42.640 --> 30:44.244
- Is something wrong?
- What? No.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.441
No.

30:45.600 --> 30:50.128
No. Look, I do have to go,
but can I give you my card? Call me?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.280
Yeah, right.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.488
That's not a line, Rene, I...

30:55.640 --> 30:57.927
I like you, I really do.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.285
But something's come up.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.091
Where's the kid?

31:17.960 --> 31:20.486
I thought we could talk alone, Katey.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.605
How long have you known?

31:24.080 --> 31:25.889
Me? Not long.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.407
But Batman's been on to you
from the start.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.370
Look, just so you know,
I haven't given up. I just

31:33.800 --> 31:35.404
needed to clear my head.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.642
We all need to
take off the mask sometimes.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.087
To remind ourselves
that we're people underneath.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.685
Dick Grayson.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.686
You know, when we were kids and I'd see
you at all those society bashes,

31:49.880 --> 31:51.245
I had quite a crush on you.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.926
Really? I thought you were
totally annoying.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.048
Took me a while
to get a hang of the girl thing.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.806
Yeah, me too.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.165
Why reveal yourself?

32:03.320 --> 32:05.209
Call it a hunch. Come on.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.447
I don't have a concussion.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.331
I wasn't aware you received
a medical degree

32:13.480 --> 32:15.847
while you were in the Himalayas,
Master Damian.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.925
I've been hurt worse than this
sparring with my grandfather.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.727
I'd hardly hold Ra's Al Ghul up

32:21.880 --> 32:24.326
as an example of
enlightened child-rearing.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.886
Master Dick was quite explicit.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.089
At least 24 hours of observation.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.051
He's not my father!

32:33.760 --> 32:34.761
And neither are you.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.649
And for that, young man,

32:36.800 --> 32:39.690
you should be profoundly grateful.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.401
He saved my life once before, you know.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.721
In a way, he created me.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.608
Yeah, he does that.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.121
He pissed me off.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.245
He does that, too.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.760
<i>When I got kicked out of the military,</i>

33:05.920 --> 33:10.084
<i>my life was a blur of sex,
drugs and techno house.</i>

33:10.920 --> 33:13.161
<i>But I thought I could take care of myself.</i>

33:17.760 --> 33:19.091
How ya doin', gorgeous?

33:19.240 --> 33:20.605
Out of my way, asshole.

33:20.760 --> 33:21.921
I don't think so.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.004
You little bitch!

33:51.040 --> 33:52.405
You're welcome.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.642
After that night, I swore I'd never
need Batman or anyone saving me again.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.442
My mother and sister
were victims of the animals out there.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.601
Not me.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.364
I get that, Kate.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.159
But it doesn't mean you have to be alone.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.121
Ahhh!

34:40.040 --> 34:42.168
You made a big mistake coming here.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.002
I was trained to never make mistakes.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.360
Just like you.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.124
Don't fight it, Damian.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.805
I've had the flaws bred out of me.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.048
But you... You're just a boy.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.046
What was it like growing up with him?

35:22.240 --> 35:24.163
When I was a kid, I idolized him.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.727
Hell, I wanted to be him.

35:27.680 --> 35:31.048
But the older I got, the more I realized
that I didn't know him at all.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.927
How could I?

35:33.440 --> 35:36.523
Bruce Wayne is as much a mask as Batman.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.524
And I think the only thing
behind those masks is pain.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.842
<i>A pain he refuses to share with anyone.</i>

35:44.120 --> 35:45.724
So what was it like?

35:47.480 --> 35:48.720
Lonely.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.041
It's Alfred.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.804
Your butler is a part of this, too?

36:44.960 --> 36:46.291
Trust me, he's a total badass.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.441
Yeah?

36:47.640 --> 36:49.961
<i>Master Damian is gone, sir.</i>

37:22.360 --> 37:23.646
Where am I?

37:28.520 --> 37:30.124
What the hell are you doing?

37:30.280 --> 37:34.365
Unfortunately, I have no more choice
in this than you do.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.725
Who are you?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.443
I'm you, Damian.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.010
All grown up.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.762
You're not me. You can't be.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.126
I'm the product of a program that your,

37:57.280 --> 37:59.487
our grandfather initiated.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.806
He wanted to create the perfect soldier.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.010
<i>They used your DNA</i>

38:05.160 --> 38:08.164
<i>and put it through a process
of accelerated growth.</i>

38:08.320 --> 38:10.402
Most of the prototypes died quickly.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.649
But I survived.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.883
I was the strongest of them all.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.561
Still,

38:17.720 --> 38:21.884
I was an empty shell, till Mr. Tetch here
brought me to full consciousness.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.967
And as good a job as he did,

38:25.120 --> 38:27.521
there's always been something missing.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.210
A void.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.761
And I'm going to fill that void

38:33.440 --> 38:34.566
with you.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.287
Everything in there

38:38.440 --> 38:40.522
is going in here.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.083
You, brother,

38:43.440 --> 38:45.920
will provide me with a soul.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.285
The hell, I am.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.249
I don't understand why she just
doesn't grow another one of you.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.721
- She's got a freezer full...
<i>- Are you insane?</i>

39:01.800 --> 39:02.881
Mother.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.324
How dare you!

39:12.480 --> 39:14.130
It wasn't my idea.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.931
- This lunatic said he'd kill me if I...
- Shut up!

39:17.280 --> 39:19.282
You'll suffer for this.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.611
My entire life I've been suffering!

39:24.320 --> 39:27.403
<i>Tell me, what is a man without memories?</i>

39:28.200 --> 39:32.091
I want to know you,
and love you, as he does.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.967
<i>I want to feel you in my heart.</i>

39:35.320 --> 39:36.651
<i>In my blood.</i>

39:38.440 --> 39:40.647
I've always served you without question.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.087
I've never asked anything of you.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.530
Please, let me have this.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.321
You poor tormented creature,

39:53.520 --> 39:56.285
how could I not have felt
the depths of your pain?

39:57.400 --> 40:00.370
<i>How could a mother have
left her child so alone.</i>

40:01.160 --> 40:02.400
<i>In the dark.</i>

40:08.880 --> 40:10.450
How could you just kill him like that?

40:10.600 --> 40:12.170
- He was...
- He was flawed.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.321
What about me, am I flawed, too?

40:15.480 --> 40:17.289
Remove all memories of this incident

40:17.440 --> 40:19.727
and then make
the other necessary adjustments.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.006
Adjustments?

40:21.160 --> 40:22.810
You're of no use to me like this.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.088
Recalcitrant, emotional.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.528
Your father's influence, no doubt.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.001
Onyx, get this trash out of here.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.001
<i>Good thing Alfred had the foresight.</i>

40:37.200 --> 40:38.884
<i>To put a tracker on the kid's uniform.</i>

40:39.600 --> 40:41.728
The Sisters of Perpetual Grace.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.565
A respected religious order
with missions across the world.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.688
Perfect front for criminal scumbags.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.965
This isn't gonna be easy.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.208
<i>Nuns with M60s and katanas?</i>

41:19.240 --> 41:21.083
That would make them nunjas.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.245
Kind of hate I let you
talk me into using rubber bullets.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.440
<i>Looks like you could use a little help.</i>

42:06.280 --> 42:07.964
- Hello, nurse.
- Luke?

42:08.840 --> 42:10.729
You want a megaphone to announce that?

42:11.080 --> 42:12.286
Call me Batwing.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.167
Batwing? That's original.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.449
Can't say I'm not glad to see you.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.961
It's the Bats.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.281
Three of them!

42:49.720 --> 42:50.960
Three?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.001
We retreat.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.281
Why?

42:56.200 --> 42:57.804
The compound is expendable.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.167
We have more urgent matters to attend to.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.761
Come.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.724
Kill him! Kill him!

43:44.160 --> 43:45.207
Aah!

44:08.680 --> 44:10.808
It's me, it's your son.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.967
Come on, Father.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.691
Batman, we need you.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.410
Can you blow those doors?

44:48.280 --> 44:49.611
God's not going to like this.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.842
I don't think she's been here for a while.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.881
This way!

45:46.840 --> 45:47.887
<i>Come on, Father.</i>

45:53.840 --> 45:54.841
How are you?

45:55.040 --> 45:58.442
In one piece, which is more
than I can say for this place.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.207
No.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.808
Thanks for saving
our butts back there, Luke.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.048
Yeah, too bad they got away.

47:42.760 --> 47:45.650
Well, Dad always wanted me
to work with Bruce Wayne.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.283
I'm proud to be a part of your team.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.843
We can handle this on our own.

47:53.080 --> 47:55.890
Nightwing, Robin, back to Gotham.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.802
You're welcome.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.565
You really should be resting.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.570
The summit's tomorrow.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.563
It's been a week, I'm fine.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.649
Like father, like son.

48:18.880 --> 48:21.326
All things considered, Master Bruce,

48:21.480 --> 48:23.721
you're in surprisingly good condition.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.845
She treated you, treated us,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.446
like we were machines
that she could just program.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.491
That's all we were to her.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.731
After Bruce Wayne completes
his hosting duties at the summit,

48:34.880 --> 48:36.689
we'll gather any leads we can to find her.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.161
Why wait?
I'll call in Kate and Luke and then...

48:39.920 --> 48:40.921
No.

48:41.080 --> 48:43.287
You shouldn't have involved them
in the first place.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.448
Batwing pretty much involved himself.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.886
And Batwoman?

48:47.360 --> 48:49.249
Did she force you to reveal our secrets?

48:51.840 --> 48:53.490
You weren't here, sir.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.405
Master Dick made a judgment call,

48:56.560 --> 48:58.369
and I think it was the right one.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.200
Maybe so, but from here on

49:02.560 --> 49:03.846
it's only family.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.171
Kate's going through the hard drive
we pulled from the convent.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.209
Fine, but when she's done, that's it.

49:10.360 --> 49:13.091
- But we have to...
- You're not Batman anymore, Dick!

49:13.240 --> 49:15.083
I call the shots around here.

49:19.440 --> 49:23.126
He's been through
an extraordinary ordeal, Master Dick.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.487
Yeah? Well, so have we.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.405
<i>As the summit kicks off today,</i>

49:28.560 --> 49:31.803
<i>politicians and dignitaries from
more than 20 nations converge on Gotham,</i>

49:31.960 --> 49:35.726
<i>for what promises to be a pivotal look
at how technology will shape our future.</i>

49:35.880 --> 49:39.248
<i>Minutes ago, Bruce Wayne
arrived to deliver the keynote address</i>

49:39.480 --> 49:40.481
<i>that will kick off the conference</i>

49:40.640 --> 49:43.564
<i>and also unveil
ground-breaking technological advances.</i>

49:43.720 --> 49:47.441
<i>Up next, researchers discover
mysterious findings on Mars.</i>

49:50.600 --> 49:52.648
What do you mean he doesn't want my help?

49:54.080 --> 49:56.401
He says he's grateful
for everything you've done, Kate,

49:56.560 --> 49:57.971
but he just feels that...

49:58.880 --> 50:00.609
Hell, you know what he's like.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.649
He just wants to keep it in the family.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.600
I thought you wanted me
to be part of the family.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.922
Yeah, what do I know?

50:14.760 --> 50:16.444
<i>Find anything on that hard drive, yet?</i>

50:16.880 --> 50:18.609
No, I gave it to Batwing.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.121
I figured his father's tech could help us.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.250
<i>I'm sorry about this, Kate.</i>

50:25.720 --> 50:27.245
If it were up to me...

50:27.640 --> 50:29.961
Nothing to be sorry about. Goodbye, Dick.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.040
Dad!

51:19.160 --> 51:22.801
<i>As the co-chair of Wayne Enterprises,</i>

51:22.960 --> 51:27.204
<i>it is my profound privilege
to present our host.</i>

51:27.400 --> 51:28.925
<i>A man of fellowship,</i>

51:29.080 --> 51:30.764
<i>A man of kindness,</i>

51:30.920 --> 51:32.922
<i>a man of peace.</i>

51:33.480 --> 51:35.403
<i>Mr. Bruce Wayne.</i>

51:54.360 --> 51:56.840
Soon, we'll be through
the looking glass, gentlemen.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.766
<i>You're all wearing beta versions</i>

51:59.920 --> 52:02.446
<i>of Wayne Tech's latest breakthrough
in communications.</i>

52:02.600 --> 52:03.647
<i>With these translators,</i>

52:03.800 --> 52:06.565
<i>we hope to build bridges
between language and culture.</i>

52:10.520 --> 52:12.329
- Hmm.
- What?

52:12.520 --> 52:14.329
We're about to take over the world.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.761
Can't a man dress for the occasion?

52:17.400 --> 52:18.640
Idiot!

52:20.880 --> 52:21.927
Walrus.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.482
<i>The world has become
a more dangerous place.</i>

52:24.640 --> 52:26.722
<i>To meet these threats,
Wayne Tech and STAR Labs</i>

52:26.880 --> 52:28.609
<i>have developed the Watchtower Initiative.</i>

52:28.760 --> 52:31.411
<i>Prepare to embark
on the greatest adventure.</i>

53:33.480 --> 53:36.370
Dad doesn't even remember doing it.
He was programmed.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.926
But why?

53:39.120 --> 53:41.043
Somehow, they knew I had that drive.

53:41.200 --> 53:44.329
Like they knew about the vault
at Wayne Enterprises.

53:44.680 --> 53:45.727
Bruce told them.

53:45.880 --> 53:46.961
Not my father.

53:47.160 --> 53:48.730
Talia had him in there for weeks

53:48.880 --> 53:51.929
and he suddenly snaps out of it
just because we show up?

53:52.480 --> 53:55.131
No, you're wrong. He's fine.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.406
No, he's not.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.525
He's not fine.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.326
She got to him.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.004
She's not finished, is she?

54:03.160 --> 54:04.600
<i>She's just getting started.</i>

54:07.520 --> 54:09.090
Found this on the hard drive.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.321
There are vice-presidents on this list.

54:13.560 --> 54:14.800
Military and corporate leaders,

54:14.920 --> 54:16.729
the Vice-Chancellor of Germany.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.450
So, why would Talia have this?

54:18.600 --> 54:22.571
What if Talia got to the men
and women on that list, brainwashed them?

54:22.920 --> 54:26.288
Then that would place the League of
Shadows' influence in every country.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.523
She'd control the world.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.160
My God, kid, your mom's got game.

54:32.240 --> 54:35.005
And all the leaders she would need
are at the summit.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.049
Along with Bruce Wayne.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.531
Master...

54:56.880 --> 54:57.881
Status?

54:58.040 --> 54:59.246
Just a second.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.446
Activating power boost.

55:03.840 --> 55:05.444
<i>You're on, Tetch.</i>

55:06.400 --> 55:08.323
Beginning brain wave synchronization.

55:09.120 --> 55:10.565
<i>So many minds.</i>

55:11.200 --> 55:12.247
<i>So little time.</i>

55:12.880 --> 55:14.928
And a new age dawns.

55:15.120 --> 55:17.691
Even Ra's Al Ghul couldn't achieve this.

55:21.440 --> 55:24.728
<i>Hey, Batwing,
need a ride in the Batwing?</i>

55:25.160 --> 55:26.446
<i>Very funny.</i>

55:28.440 --> 55:29.965
You sure they won't know we're coming?

55:30.120 --> 55:32.771
<i>Not once we jam their radar
and shut down the alarm system.</i>

55:32.920 --> 55:34.888
Good thing you got us those schematics.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.920
<i>Hope my dad understands
when he finds out I hacked his computer.</i>

55:39.760 --> 55:40.761
Got 'em.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.086
Engaging auto-pilot.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.851
Heads up, looks like we've got company.

56:19.600 --> 56:20.965
How long, Kuttler?

56:21.880 --> 56:23.484
Twenty minutes at most.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.125
Make it 10.

56:25.760 --> 56:26.886
Get it.

56:27.880 --> 56:29.723
I brought you a little something.

56:41.480 --> 56:43.920
We've got to find
the dignitaries and evacuate them.

56:44.200 --> 56:45.281
What about Father?

56:45.440 --> 56:47.408
Our first priority is
getting those people out.

56:47.560 --> 56:48.561
Not mine.

57:02.360 --> 57:03.930
We don't have time for this, Damian.

57:04.440 --> 57:06.124
Join us or die.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.126
Father.

57:30.520 --> 57:34.366
<i>The League of Shadows
compels you to be one with us.</i>

57:34.720 --> 57:36.370
<i>There is no you.</i>

57:36.960 --> 57:38.371
<i>You have no home.</i>

57:39.120 --> 57:40.451
<i>You have no people.</i>

58:47.320 --> 58:49.004
Ahhh!

59:32.200 --> 59:33.486
That can't be good.

59:46.320 --> 59:50.211
<i>You are the League of Shadows
and it is your home.</i>

59:50.360 --> 59:52.010
<i>We are your people.</i>

59:52.160 --> 59:53.321
About time you came back.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.682
Indeed.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.280
Come on!

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.367
No!

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.481
Justice!

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.889
Not vengeance.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.801
Damn.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.724
<i>Batwing to Robin. Uh...</i>

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.291
Got a situation here.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.724
I need you to manually transfer power

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.201
from the damaged thruster
to the remaining two.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.640
<i>Crap!</i>

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.040
<i>Dad's gonna kill me.</i>

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.211
You dirty...

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.841
<i>The League of Shadows...</i>

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.451
Shut it down.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.161
<i>You have no...</i>

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.725
<i>You are the League of Shadows.</i>

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.926
Bloody hell.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.087
Huh?

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.530
<i>Cutting it kind of close!</i>

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.120
<i>Hurry up, kid!</i>

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.646
Well done, beloved.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.962
We will at least have this victory.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.320
Finish him.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.488
Bruce! Don't.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.528
That's what it's all about
in the end, isn't it, Mother?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.890
Not the vision of a better world
my grandfather had.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.804
It's just about control.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.651
Start with the bastard.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.131
We can always make more.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.725
Bruce, you don't kill.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.291
You've never killed.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.764
Don't let her win.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.362
Don't let her take your soul.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.249
<i>If anything, I have cleansed it.</i>

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.603
I washed away his trauma.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.686
<i>Finish them.</i>

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.082
You brought us all together
because you understood our pain,

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.811
<i>our loneliness better than anyone could.</i>

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.451
<i>We needed family.</i>

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.446
<i>We needed you.</i>

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.126
Shoot him!

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.442
You're not just a mask.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.331
You're a man.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.922
The best man I've ever known.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.203
No!

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.691
Can't fight it.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.330
Yes, you can, damn it!

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.211
For the little boy
who lost his world in that alley.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.609
Enough!

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.526
I'm sorry.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.448
I'm so sorry.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.485
It's all right, Father.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.241
That's for what you did
to my father, bitch!

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.806
It's over, Mother.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.289
Your grand plan has ended.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.082
How is it I ever loved either of you?

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.850
I don't think you ever did.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.209
Beloved, you have no idea.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.285
<i>I have thought of little else
for the last 12 years.</i>

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.204
<i>But nothing,</i>

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.251
not my passion,
not the death of my father,

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.609
not even our child
could bring you to my side.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.249
I know now,
I will never have you in this life.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.722
- But perhaps, in death.
- Get her!

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.365
She played us again.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.250
From what Nightwing said,

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.445
once the programming is broken,
it can't be reset.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.490
Not yours, not anybody's.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.649
Well, I suppose Tetch could've done it,
if he hadn't lost his head.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.170
I'm proud of you, Kate.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.327
Gabrielle and Elizabeth
would be proud, too.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.286
I hope so.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.563
I'm a... A little early.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.131
No, no.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.645
You're right on time.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.400
<i>I'm heading to the tower.</i>

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.005
Thanks for lunch, Alfred.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.962
- What's going on?
- Master Bruce is having

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.009
a heart-to-heart with Damian.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.887
One can't help feeling bad.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.889
<i>Despite her madness,</i>

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.724
<i>she was his mother.</i>

01:08:10.748 --> 01:08:26.747
