WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:02.210
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:02.252 --> 00:05.630
It's been 39 days since Talon
brought the Blackbloods through.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.382
She's the last remaining
Blackblood prophetess.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.135
I am Yavalla,
prophetess of the Blackbloods.

00:10.176 --> 00:13.054
The way to paradise
is somewhere at the Outpost.

00:13.096 --> 00:16.683
- The kinj.
- I'm requisitioning this
facility for official use.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.601
- Excuse me?
- I need your word

00:18.643 --> 00:20.353
that there will be no more
trouble from your people.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.313
My people will remain peaceful.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.899
For the sins
of your ancestors.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.569
- For the Queen.
- ( groans )

00:46.129 --> 00:47.964
( growls )

00:48.006 --> 00:49.382
( shouts )

01:07.067 --> 01:08.610
( growling )

01:23.917 --> 01:25.085
( shouts )

01:33.051 --> 01:34.552
( shouts )

02:04.541 --> 02:05.500
( growling )

02:08.753 --> 02:11.256
( gasping )

02:13.299 --> 02:16.261
( theme music playing )

02:22.559 --> 02:24.811
( grunting, gasping )

02:39.534 --> 02:42.370
Any last words, human,

02:42.412 --> 02:44.372
before justice is done?

02:45.456 --> 02:46.833
Justice?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.129
Blood for blood.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.512
Zed, you'd go to war
with your own kind

02:59.554 --> 03:01.681
to protect
one worthless human?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.809
We might be the same species,
Yobahn, but we are not
the same kind.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.270
The priestess will judge him
after a trial.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.484
This man murdered Kezzun

03:13.526 --> 03:16.738
and another of my men
in cold blood.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.156
You gave me your word

03:18.198 --> 03:20.074
your people wouldn't do
something like this.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.618
Now look what has happened.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.037
If Captain Spears did this,
he had a reason.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.331
Kezzun tried to murder
their queen.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.957
Garret is her
sworn protector.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.167
If Yobahn disciplined his man,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.460
none of this
would have happened.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.836
Kezzun was demoted.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.004
He should have died
for that crime.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.672
Yobahn: For what?

03:34.714 --> 03:38.092
For allegedly trying
to kill a human?

03:41.387 --> 03:44.974
And there she sits,
without any harm done to her.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.185
This was not a life
for a life.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.145
He would have killed me
had Zed has not stopped him.

03:49.187 --> 03:53.399
Would have?
Conspiracy is not
punishable by death.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.443
You know that, Zed.

03:55.485 --> 04:00.156
This human murdered
two of my men in cold blood!

04:00.198 --> 04:03.076
Technically, your Lu-Qiri
killed one of them.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.621
And I did not murder Kezzun.
It was a fair fight.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.249
Impossible.
Kezzun was a great warrior.

04:09.290 --> 04:14.128
He was a mediocre warrior
and he was high on colipsum.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.839
- Ah!
- Yobahn.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.682
Captain Spears,
do you deny killing Kezzun?

04:28.017 --> 04:31.437
I killed him,
but it was not murder.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.814
Was it self defense?

04:32.855 --> 04:34.315
He was defending the queen.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.483
He was seeking retribution.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.068
Garret is not a murderer.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.569
Kezzun's life
was not his to take.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.530
Mine is not Kezzun's to take.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.782
You are a queen.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.076
If a man ignores your own law

04:45.118 --> 04:48.663
for vengeance and murder,
what would be your judgment?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.044
As I thought.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.548
No!

04:59.632 --> 05:02.385
Captain Garret Spears,

05:02.427 --> 05:04.971
you are sentenced
in the tradition of
our ancestors--

05:05.013 --> 05:06.639
No!

05:09.100 --> 05:10.018
( snarls )

05:11.853 --> 05:13.229
To death by drowning.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.775
May your death bring peace
through justice.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.485
I won't let you murder him!

05:19.527 --> 05:23.239
I'm sorry, Talon,
I must uphold the law.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.167
Janzo, they're going to
execute Garret.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.503
What? I thought Gwynn
would've been able to...

05:37.545 --> 05:40.715
She tried, all right?
So did Zed, but they
won't listen to her.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.301
- We have to stop it.
- "We"? And how do you
suppose "we" do that?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.137
You and I against
dozens of Blackbloods
and a bunch of Lu-Qiri?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.723
- We don't stand a chance.
- I don't know, Janzo, just--

05:48.765 --> 05:50.433
just think
of something, all right?
There has to be a way.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.268
How do they plan
on doing it?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.478
Decapitation? Hanging?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.521
The traditional
Blackblood execution.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.315
- Drowning.
- Drow-- why would
they do it that way?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.941
Because Blackbloods
are terrified of drowning.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.735
Think of something, Janzo.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.111
Right. Come on.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.799
There's too many.
We wouldn't have a chance.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.009
The price for rebellion
is death.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.345
Captain Spears
has made his choice,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.972
- and now he will die for it.
- ( crowd gasping )

06:30.014 --> 06:32.016
Without justice,
there can be no peace.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.227
This isn't peace!
This is tyranny!

06:34.268 --> 06:37.063
The trial is over
and the sentence is death.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.565
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Proceed.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.866
Janzo: Wait!

06:48.908 --> 06:52.286
Wait!

06:52.328 --> 06:55.331
The least you can do
is to allow Talon
to say a proper good-bye.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.333
This man saved her life
more than once.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.627
He means a lot to her.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.466
I will allow it.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.363
( gulping )

07:29.782 --> 07:32.076
- What was that?
- Shh.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.580
Good-bye, Garret.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.754
Yobahn: Proceed.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.758
( crowd gasping )

08:05.359 --> 08:06.277
That's enough. He's dead.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.077
( crowd gasping )

08:17.288 --> 08:18.581
A life for a life.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.000
Justice is satisfied.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.508
This human is dead.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.469
Step aside, come on.
Respect for the dead.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.221
This man deserves
a proper burial.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.681
- We will take it from here.
- My condolences.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.850
I understand
he was close to you.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.480
Garret Spears was a hero

08:42.522 --> 08:44.690
to all the Outpost.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.692
Yavalla: Perhaps in time
you will forgive me.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.403
I did what I thought was just.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.989
Surely you understand
why it had to be done.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.039
You're monsters, all of you.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.126
Garret Spears was a hero,
but how quickly you all
forget how he saved us all,

09:04.168 --> 09:05.836
especially you
and your Lu-Qiri

09:05.878 --> 09:08.130
when you were about
to die in battle.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.465
Shame on you!

09:11.759 --> 09:15.137
And you, Zed,
you had me fooled back there.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.889
Thought you were a good man.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.141
But I couldn't have been
more wrong.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.735
- Do you think it worked?
- Don't know.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.112
But we don't have much time.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.067
( gasping )

10:10.109 --> 10:12.236
What happened?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.989
Talon passed you
a sleeping death elixir
when she kissed you.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.576
It slows down the heart rate
to almost nothing

10:18.618 --> 10:20.661
until you take the antidote.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.497
Unless you wait
too long, of course.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.042
Any longer,
you'd have been actually dead.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.960
- Oh.
- Open.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.880
Janzo, you're a genius.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.506
Uh, what about me?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.510
- Open. Ah.
- Yeah.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.846
Eyes. Hmm.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.223
Why'd you kill the Blackfist?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.600
Because he tried to kill Gwynn.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.893
- Yeah, but he didn't.
- Ahh!

10:43.934 --> 10:45.978
You knew what would happen
if you did that.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.064
You knew the consequences.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.024
- You're just trying
to kill yourself.
- What? No.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.234
Clearly Sana and The Three
just messed him up so badly

10:52.276 --> 10:54.487
that he's become suicidal.

10:54.528 --> 10:57.365
What other explanation
do you have for
your stupid behavior?

10:57.406 --> 11:00.284
Well, to be honest,
I hadn't really thought
it all through that--

11:00.326 --> 11:01.786
- ( grunts )
- Obviously not.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.039
- Please stop hitting me.
- I'm so angry at you.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.341
- Huh.
- Don't do that again.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.096
All right,
but if you kiss me as well,

11:20.137 --> 11:21.931
then it is tempting.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.433
All right, so what now?

11:26.560 --> 11:29.855
Well, everyone already thinks
he's dead anyway,

11:29.897 --> 11:32.775
- so just open--
there we go.
- Ah!

11:32.817 --> 11:36.112
He'll have to
just wait down here
and recover in hiding.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.989
If he shows his face,
then they'll probably just
want to kill him again.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.741
Probably even want
to just chop off your head.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.451
But guess what.
I don't have
any elixirs for that.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.623
No, no, please,
no more hitting.
I-- I can't--

11:51.794 --> 11:53.671
Hey, how come
he gets two kisses?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.464
'Cause she's not
in love with you, stupid.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.675
- ( Munt muttering )
- Janzo: Let's go!

11:57.717 --> 11:59.885
- Why did she kiss me?
- Come on, you nosy warthog,
let's go.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.846
- Maybe if we wait,
we can get another chance.
- Let's go!

12:08.769 --> 12:10.604
Mm.

12:10.646 --> 12:14.066
I think my ribs
are trying to punish me.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.277
Broken ribs will tend
to do that.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.072
Ah!

12:22.867 --> 12:26.537
That's what you get
for being so reckless.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.123
You used to tell me
the opposite,

12:29.165 --> 12:32.793
that I was too cautious
and too proper.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.672
Yeah, well,
things were different then.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.507
How?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.595
I saw you die, Garret.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.723
And I never want
to see that again,
you understand me?

12:45.765 --> 12:49.351
Talon, that bastard
tried to kill our queen.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.395
If given the chance,
he would have tried again.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.938
It filled me with rage.
I couldn't stop myse--

12:52.980 --> 12:55.941
Yeah, and I wanted
to kill him, too,

12:55.983 --> 12:58.486
but killing just leads
to more killing.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.157
The old Garret knew that.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.410
I'm not the old
Garret anymore.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.246
Ever since The Three
messed with my brain,
I've been so--

13:09.288 --> 13:10.873
And you need to let that go.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.379
I know.
It won't happen again.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.766
Stay here.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.768
Stay quiet.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.187
And rest up.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.980
I'll be back.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.780
Where are you going?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.740
Can't let Gwynn
believe you're dead.

13:59.129 --> 14:03.801
Oh, sweet gods.
That's the best news
I've heard in a long time.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.389
- No one can know.
- Of course. How is he?

14:08.430 --> 14:13.227
He's weak from the beatings
and the poison, but he'll mend.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.272
I'm just worried his anger
will drive him to do
something stupid again.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.232
Hmm. Sounds like
someone else I know.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.444
- Hey.
- You know, I feel so useless.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.654
I'm cut off from everyone.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
Hasn't Yavalla
given you more freedom?

14:25.739 --> 14:27.908
No. I don't think
she ever will.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.661
She hasn't won you over
with the promises
of peace and love?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.830
Mm. Call me crazy,
but nothing that's ever

14:32.872 --> 14:34.164
walked out of
the Plane of Ashes

14:34.206 --> 14:36.834
has made my life
easier thus far.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.836
Look, I really hope
it's different this time.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.462
And so do I.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.965
You must find out
what she's up to.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.223
I told you
to stay out of here.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.474
My ale is downstairs.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.685
My thirsty patrons
are upstairs.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.480
Seems that Blackbloods
have twice the tolerance
of human drinkers.

14:58.522 --> 15:03.068
- Just hurry up.
- You know, you've, uh,
been floundering around

15:03.110 --> 15:04.945
with that box
for a few days now.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.780
- I might be able to help.
- No.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.450
Why? What are you scared of?
That I'm smarter than you?

15:23.547 --> 15:25.132
- Mm?
- Question.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.509
Was this box designed
to keep the wrong person out

15:27.551 --> 15:30.596
or was it designed
to let the right person in?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.723
It was designed
to let my mother
the high priestess in.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.516
Now give it back.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.976
It's pretty evil-looking,
isn't it?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.478
I mean,
look at all these skulls.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.812
That's a cultural bias.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.564
You call our Lu-Qiri demons

15:40.606 --> 15:41.732
like they're
some kind of monster

15:41.774 --> 15:43.025
out of a human fairy tale.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.526
- Give it to me.
- No!

15:44.568 --> 15:46.779
- No! Get off!
- Give it to me.

15:46.820 --> 15:51.742
Wren, do you know
what represents danger
in almost every culture?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.328
- Mm. Fine.
- Skulls.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.330
Then it was designed
to keep the wrong person out.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.541
My mother is not
the wrong person.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.876
If you say so.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.008
What if it was designed
to keep everyone out?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.134
What if it was designed

16:09.176 --> 16:11.178
to protect us
and the whole world

16:11.220 --> 16:15.224
from whatever
is inside that box?

16:30.030 --> 16:31.740
( indistinct chatter )

16:38.747 --> 16:39.915
Yavalla.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.503
Yavalla.

16:46.630 --> 16:47.589
Can I talk to you?

16:47.631 --> 16:49.758
Of course.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.387
Wait here.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.577
So, Talon,
what can I do for you?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.585
You can tell me what
you're really doing here.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.629
I believe
I've told you everything.

17:27.671 --> 17:31.175
I don't believe you have.
You're holding something back.

17:31.216 --> 17:35.012
I admire your candor,
disrespectful as it may be.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.722
You have to earn
my respect to get it.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.974
Then I hope I will.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.935
My dear, you are so much
like your father.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.356
- I never knew my father.
- I did.

17:46.398 --> 17:50.569
You have the same stubborn
fighting spirit.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.820
How could you know my father?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.447
You were banished to
the Plane of Ashes

17:53.489 --> 17:55.199
before he was even born.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.617
I knew him
in the Plane of Ashes.

17:56.658 --> 18:01.497
- I don't believe you.
- His name was Sai-vek.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.458
- Sai-vek Redwan.
- So you have a name.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.336
- It proves nothing.
- What do you know
of your father?

18:09.088 --> 18:13.467
Not much. He was gone
before I can remember.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.803
My mother said
he died saving us.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.472
Your mother opened the portal
and sent him through.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.600
Why would she do that?

18:21.642 --> 18:22.810
He would never say.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.228
He lived apart from us,

18:24.269 --> 18:25.896
rarely let us
get close to him.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.565
I tried talking
to him occasionally.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.401
He was difficult.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.278
Headstrong.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.031
A loner. Sound familiar?

18:36.073 --> 18:39.076
Is he still there?

18:39.118 --> 18:42.079
No. He passed away
a little while ago.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.793
How'd he die?

18:47.835 --> 18:52.506
Talon, the Plane of Ashes
is a brutal place.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.007
I'm sorry.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.263
Gwynn: I have done
all that Yavalla asked.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.889
She's given my people
more freedom,

19:00.931 --> 19:02.224
so why has that courtesy
not been extended to me?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.561
And allow you
among your people? Why?

19:05.602 --> 19:08.313
So you can hatch
some new revolution?

19:08.355 --> 19:09.940
Because I'm lonely, Zed.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.317
Is that something
you can understand?

19:12.359 --> 19:15.946
Maybe more than most.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.115
If our roles were reversed,

19:18.157 --> 19:20.242
would you let me meet
with my soldiers?

19:20.284 --> 19:23.745
Not really relevant.
I would have taken your head.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.456
I'm sure that's true.
So does that answer
your question?

19:28.792 --> 19:32.129
Will you at least give me
the dignity of having
my handmaid back?

19:32.171 --> 19:35.007
It would be someone
to talk to.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.383
Or is a handmaid
too big a threat for you?

19:36.425 --> 19:39.011
Fine. You can meet
with your handmaiden.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.096
But only once a day.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.786
Progress, daughter?

20:04.828 --> 20:07.623
Mother, I didn't know
you were coming.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.999
It has been several days.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.459
I had expected
a breakthrough by now.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.377
I know. I know.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.130
And I've been researching,
analyzing, and experimenting.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.548
Three holes, three symbols.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.091
This one was lichen spore.
Easy enough.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.801
This one was abracite crystal.
Fine.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.929
And this one? Black oak?
I don't know.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.139
I've tried everything.
I can't seem to figure out
what's going on--

20:24.181 --> 20:28.977
Stop. Just breathe.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.814
It will come to you.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.983
Everything is riding on this.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.611
I need what is in that box.

20:37.653 --> 20:42.199
The Outpost, it is like
dry grass waiting for a spark.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.285
There is so much tension
between ourselves
and the humans.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.496
I know, Mother,
and I'm almost there.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.414
It's something simple,
I know it. I'm--

20:49.456 --> 20:52.834
- I'm just stuck right now.
- Then get unstuck.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.630
Unlocking that box
is the way to unlock peace
in this world.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.382
All of us are counting on you.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.593
- I understand.
- I hope so.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.930
Because if you fail,
this world will surely explode

21:04.972 --> 21:07.766
into war and death.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.667
- ( clears throat )
- What?

21:33.709 --> 21:37.087
So, um, if you open
that black box of yours,

21:37.129 --> 21:38.588
then the Blackfist
will finally leave us alone?

21:38.630 --> 21:41.425
- That's the plan.
- Then let me help you.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.053
- I don't need your help.
- Seems like time isn't
exactly on your side.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.680
Ah, you were eavesdropping.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.850
Might have overheard
a thing or two.

21:49.891 --> 21:53.520
Yavalla said that
your failure would result in
death and war in this world.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.940
Besides, I'm no stranger
to a demanding mother.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.277
Do you know what?
Actually, one time my mother
got bitten by a Plagueling.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.571
Do you know what I had to do?
I had to develop a cure

22:02.612 --> 22:06.116
for the whole Plagueling
epidemic before her body
turned to colipsum.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.451
Do I look like I care?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.538
The point is
that I saved her life,

22:11.580 --> 22:13.123
not that she ever thanked me.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.042
She always just expected me

22:15.083 --> 22:16.918
to know everything
and perform miracles.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.254
- Sounds like my mother.
- I'm trying to relate.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.674
- Where is your mother?
- She was killed.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.679
In the act of saving my life.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.726
I'm sorry.

22:32.768 --> 22:36.313
- So what haven't you tried?
- Shouldn't we start with
what I have tried?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.856
No point rehashing
what you have tried

22:37.898 --> 22:39.524
because clearly
it hasn't worked, has it?

22:39.566 --> 22:41.526
Well,
if I knew all the things
that I haven't tried,

22:41.568 --> 22:45.030
I would have already
tried them, obviously.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.366
The lichen spore was a cinch,
the abracite was obvious,
but then this--

22:47.407 --> 22:49.951
Really? I would have never
decoded the mark for abracite.

22:49.993 --> 22:53.330
- It was brilliant. Well done.
- Yes, it was brilliant.
Thank you.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.540
But this one, you see,
the mouth hole is just
the symbol for "tree."

22:55.582 --> 22:58.126
It looks like black oak.
But there is no leaf,
bark, or wood extract

22:58.168 --> 23:00.170
- that reacts with
lichen spore and abracite.
- Have you tried thornberry?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.464
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- Hmm, oak pulp?

23:02.506 --> 23:04.549
Gnarled ash?
Oh, spruce bark?

23:04.591 --> 23:06.510
Yes, all of that
and dozens more.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.475
- Why is it upside down?
- What?

23:13.517 --> 23:16.978
Come. This, this is
the Yindrian sigil for tree,

23:17.020 --> 23:19.606
but it's upside down
in relation to
the other symbols.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.691
So it's a upside down tree.
What difference does it make?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.777
Hmm.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.570
Maybe it's not a tree.
What if it's...

23:25.612 --> 23:27.781
- Both: Roots!
- But which root essence
would react--

23:27.823 --> 23:30.158
Hemlock root.
Hemlock root plus abracite
makes ravensbane.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.785
Which reacts with
lichen spore to make...

23:31.827 --> 23:33.537
- Both: Infernal acid!
- Boom!

23:33.578 --> 23:35.580
Well, not really boom, right?
We don't want boom.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.124
We have to be very,
very careful.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.168
Hemlock root.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.963
Don't get carried away.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.005
I've had false
breakthroughs before.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.049
- It'll work.
- Right.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.968
So, lichen spore
in the right eye,

23:48.009 --> 23:49.886
abracite in the left,
hemlock root in the mouth hole.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.180
All at once.
Don't screw this up, human.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.559
On three.
One, two, three.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.312
Not too much abracite.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.410
( clicking, whirring )

24:13.452 --> 24:14.870
Hmm.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.040
It worked!

24:19.082 --> 24:21.042
- But what is it?
- I don't know.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.919
Janzo: Don't get too close.
It might be dangerous.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.555
What is it?

24:35.056 --> 24:37.350
It's a map! It's a map!

24:37.392 --> 24:39.936
Clearly marking the location
of the entrance.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.981
This is it, Mother,
and it's right here
in the Outpost.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.399
Well, the city's completely
different, of course,

24:44.441 --> 24:46.151
and none of the buildings
are the same.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.944
I just need to coordinate
the landmarks somehow.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.113
May I ask,
where does this map lead to?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.407
- Who is that?
- Well, he helped me
unlock the box.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.409
You alone
were entrusted to this.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.704
Mother, without Janzo's help,
I may never have opened it.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.665
I had thought my daughter
smart enough to solve
this riddle herself.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.878
- I suppose I owe you thanks.
- I only just helped.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.298
It was actually
your daughter's genius
that solved it.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.344
Well, whoever is responsible,

25:12.385 --> 25:14.304
at least the pathway
is now clear.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.307
Well, it's not exactly a path
and it's anything but clear.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.602
Opening this box
is most likely the easiest
part of the whole conundrum.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.730
We survived
in the Plane of Ashes
for centuries.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.483
Everything is easy
compared to that.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.069
All I'm saying is that
whoever designed that map

25:29.110 --> 25:30.862
went to great lengths
to make it difficult.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.072
Painfully,
extraordinarily difficult.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.615
Jonesy-o,
that is your name, yes?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.909
- Mm.
- Jonesy-o, we thank you.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.662
You may leave us now
without another word.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.085
It's actually Janz--

25:47.546 --> 25:48.505
Jonesy-o is just fine.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.805
Yavalla: The only thing
that matters now

25:56.846 --> 25:59.683
is finding the lost kinj
with all haste.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.852
Zed, maintain the peace
a little while longer.

26:02.894 --> 26:08.191
We shall all soon
be rewarded in paradise.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.865
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.918
Garret, do you
remember your mother?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.006
Not really.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.383
I think I was about
four years old when she died.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.760
Most of the images of her
that I still have in my mind,

26:35.802 --> 26:40.181
they're, uh-- they're vague.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.309
Same as my father.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.562
Yavalla said she knew him
in the Plane of Ashes.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.355
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.193
Said my mother sent him
through the portal.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.195
Why would she do that?

26:54.237 --> 26:56.197
Don't know.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.407
Yavalla doesn't know either.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.784
Maybe she's lying.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.995
I don't think so.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.580
Why would you trust her?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.541
Well, I don't trust her.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.168
But why would she lie
about knowing my father?

27:08.209 --> 27:10.962
To manipulate you.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.214
To get you
to open the portal
and go see him.

27:13.256 --> 27:16.801
That's not it.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.261
She told me he's dead.

27:24.476 --> 27:28.396
Well, maybe she's just trying
to get you to drop your guard.

27:34.027 --> 27:34.944
Maybe.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.202
But whatever it is,
I'm going to find out.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.469
Warlita, I'm so glad
Zed allowed you to come.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.804
As am I, Majesty.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.475
Let me do that.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.478
I've come accustomed to doing
these things for myself.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.355
Now you have me back.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.609
I didn't ask you here
to brush my hair, Warlita.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.444
I need your services
in another capacity.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.489
Yes, ma'am. Anything.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.159
I had tremendous distrust
that Yavalla and Zed
will ever free us.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.079
They scare me, Your Majesty.

28:26.121 --> 28:30.583
Me, too. I need to speak with
Lord Tobin to devise a strategy.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.086
- I could take a message.
- It needs to be more
of a conversation.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.754
I must speak
with him in person.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.047
And how can I help?

29:05.952 --> 29:07.287
( knocking on door )

29:10.665 --> 29:13.501
- ( knocking )
- All right.

29:22.802 --> 29:23.720
Warlita?

29:25.847 --> 29:26.765
Do you have word from Gwynn?

29:30.185 --> 29:31.686
Better than word.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.315
Gentlemen,
may we have the room?

29:38.693 --> 29:40.111
Man: Come on.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.591
- Gods, I missed you.
- Not as much
as I've missed you.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.178
- How did you get out?
- Warlita took my place.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.931
Warlita is queen now?
Excellent.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.397
You must go to Aegisford.
Raise an army.

30:16.439 --> 30:20.527
Lay siege at the Outpost
until Yavalla and Zed...

30:20.568 --> 30:23.404
- I thought you--
- ...free us and our people.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.282
I thought you
wanted to see me purely
for romantic reasons.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.201
I do.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.496
Look, I love you, Tobin,

30:31.538 --> 30:35.291
but I must send you away.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.670
You're the only one
that can save us now.

30:38.711 --> 30:42.257
There are demons on every wall.
Blackbloods at every egress.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.426
Not every.
There's a secret route
through the mines,

30:45.468 --> 30:46.553
a smuggler's route.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.019
How do I find it?

30:55.061 --> 30:56.646
Take Munt.
He knows the way.

30:56.688 --> 31:02.235
Munt? Are you sure?

31:02.277 --> 31:04.028
'Cause it seems
like Yavalla is planning
to set us free anyway.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.780
I don't trust her. Do you?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.907
- I don't trust any Blackblood.
- Except Talon.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.450
I don't trust her, either.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.994
The way she aligned herself
with the Blackbloods?

31:12.495 --> 31:14.789
Things aren't always
as they appear.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.668
You must go.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.840
Can I wait until
after midnight, maybe?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.675
I mean, there's
a lot fewer guards then.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.761
Okay, after midnight.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.721
Good.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.850
In the meantime...

31:38.938 --> 31:40.440
( door opens )

31:43.526 --> 31:45.069
What are you doing? Get out.
We're closed.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.237
That's fine.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.825
I'm here for Munt.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.412
I'm Munt.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.837
Where are you going in such
a hurry, servant girl?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.091
Servant girl!

32:07.133 --> 32:12.096
- I serve the queen.
- ( laughing )

32:12.138 --> 32:14.974
Queen of what? Her bedroom?

32:15.016 --> 32:18.394
Why don't you try serving
the real ruler of this Outpost?

32:19.896 --> 32:20.897
Unhand me.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.316
You're not supposed to be

32:23.358 --> 32:26.152
out of your room, Queenie.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.153
- Come on.
- ( Gwynn grunts )

32:27.195 --> 32:28.529
Leave her alone!

32:34.786 --> 32:37.455
What are you going to do,
an old unarmed man?

32:37.497 --> 32:40.959
I've sworn to protect
my queen with my bare hands
if it comes to that.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.211
- Now let her go.
- Better run along.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.713
- Not until you release her.
- I'll give you one chance.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.881
I'll give you one chance.

32:49.968 --> 32:50.885
( grunts )

33:01.062 --> 33:04.565
Whoa, she's safe.
That's all I wanted.
Now let's part ways.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.613
- No!
- Murderer!

33:19.205 --> 33:22.417
Everyone saw this.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.294
This old man assaulted me.

33:25.336 --> 33:29.090
My queen, it's--
it's been an honor.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.806
- ( muttering )
- No, stop!

33:36.848 --> 33:38.641
He must die for his actions,
Your Majesty!

33:38.683 --> 33:41.519
Not like this.
Take him into custody!

33:43.521 --> 33:44.856
( screams )

33:44.897 --> 33:47.692
Take him away!

33:47.734 --> 33:51.821
Is this the peace
you promised?

33:51.863 --> 33:55.116
An unarmed man was murdered
defending the queen's honor.

33:55.158 --> 33:58.077
Calkussar was our friend
and our brother,

33:58.119 --> 33:59.495
and we will have vengeance!

34:01.247 --> 34:04.834
- Your Majesty, this incident--
- Gwynn: He murdered him.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.629
This animal murdered
Captain Calkussar
for defending my honor,

34:08.671 --> 34:12.550
and for that,
we demand the same justice

34:12.592 --> 34:14.385
that was dealt
to Captain Spears.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.471
Is that true, Yobahn?

34:24.395 --> 34:26.981
It is agreed.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.192
The same justice
shall be carried out.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.487
Take him away.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.781
No! No!

34:34.822 --> 34:37.158
No! No!

34:37.200 --> 34:38.826
No!

34:44.499 --> 34:47.418
( crowd murmuring )

34:49.670 --> 34:51.047
Any last words?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.466
Blackbloods don't kill
Blackbloods.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.384
You killed yourself with
your own actions, Yobahn.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.228
Wait! Wait!
This is wrong!

35:05.269 --> 35:08.022
Wait! Wait!

35:09.732 --> 35:11.484
Let it be known
the law applies equally

35:11.526 --> 35:12.735
to Blackbloods
and humans alike.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.278
( gurgling )

35:14.320 --> 35:15.696
May the gods overlook
his crimes

35:15.738 --> 35:17.240
and accept this warrior

35:17.281 --> 35:19.575
as he crosses
to the other shore.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.663
( splashing )

35:28.918 --> 35:29.877
It's done.

35:33.214 --> 35:36.926
I hope this
convinces Your Majesty
my intentions are just.

35:36.968 --> 35:41.639
There will be peace,
no matter the cost.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.111
Don't know if
I should be doing this.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.530
- I don't need no trouble.
- ( Tobin grunts )

35:57.572 --> 36:00.324
Oh, you'll be a hero, Munt.
You'll be saving your queen.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.452
- I will?
- Yeah.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.955
So these mines, they, uh--
they get us out how, exactly?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.374
They lead to the pipes,
which leads to the dam wall.

36:10.501 --> 36:11.627
Dam wall?

36:24.599 --> 36:26.726
- ( gasps )
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.733
- This is the only way?
- Yeah.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.860
Beautiful, isn't she?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.739
I think I might just be
a little bit afraid of heights.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.699
Ah, it's not so bad.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.160
Now you just--

36:44.202 --> 36:45.286
you just hold onto
this chain...

36:47.330 --> 36:49.207
...and you walk that ledge.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.458
Don't worry.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.543
Been used for years
by Mum's smugglers.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.963
Smuggled all sorts of things,
even Gwynn herself.

36:56.005 --> 36:59.759
Right. You go first.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.428
Me? No. No, I'm not going.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.598
Munt, I need your help.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.683
You've proven yourself
a warrior now,

37:07.725 --> 37:09.101
not a barmaid.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.812
I like the sound of that.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.689
- Munt the Warrior.
- Sure.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.942
Whatever you want
to call yourself, Munt.

37:18.152 --> 37:22.031
Munt the Magnificent,
do-er of mighty deeds!

37:22.073 --> 37:23.032
You've got this.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.619
- Munt, the man who--
- Go, Munt!

37:26.661 --> 37:28.412
Right, right, yeah.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.623
( grunts )

37:30.665 --> 37:31.999
Okay, there we go.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.252
All right,
do you like that better

37:34.293 --> 37:36.212
or do you like
Munt the Magnificent?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.631
Sure. Whatever.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.553
See, everything on this map
is different except from--

37:44.595 --> 37:46.847
except from the mountains
and the dam wall,

37:46.889 --> 37:49.225
which is the oldest remaining
structure on the Outpost.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.185
Yeah, but even just that
is enough to triangulate.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.486
- Wren?
- What?

38:00.528 --> 38:01.612
Wren?

38:17.503 --> 38:20.464
Is it even possible
that this is the same well?

38:20.506 --> 38:22.091
I mean, how old is this map?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.551
My mother said
the box was handed down

38:23.592 --> 38:24.885
between Blackbloods
for the past seven centuries.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.470
Well, nothing's
that old around here

38:26.512 --> 38:29.640
except, uh, that.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.477
If that old wall
is this wall...

38:33.519 --> 38:35.688
And we're here,

38:35.730 --> 38:36.897
then we just have to
follow the wall.

38:36.939 --> 38:40.568
Let's go!

38:40.609 --> 38:41.527
Come on!

38:48.826 --> 38:52.496
- What are we doing?
- It's just, uh...

38:52.538 --> 38:54.498
Wait. You know the way, right?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.125
Yeah, I know the way.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.919
- To where?
- To Aegisford, Munt.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.921
We're going to Aegisford.
Rosmund said you knew the way.

39:00.963 --> 39:03.632
No, no, no.
I know the way out
of the Outpost.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.510
- So we're lost?
- Don't worry.

39:06.552 --> 39:11.349
I've been to Aegisford,
just, uh, not from here.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.933
But either way,
I've always known
which way to go.

39:12.975 --> 39:16.312
- And how is that?
- Always downhill.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.065
Munt, this mission's too
important to be left to chance.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.442
There's no time to be
wandering in the woods.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.362
We're going to raise an army
to fight the Outpost, right?

39:24.403 --> 39:26.280
But what if I don't
want another war?

39:26.322 --> 39:28.783
Sometimes war is
the only option, Munt.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.534
The war hasn't started,

39:30.576 --> 39:32.370
and we still have the option
of not starting it.

39:32.411 --> 39:35.164
The Blackbloods
have already started it.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.168
After the big battle,
they sent me out
to help bury the bodies.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.838
A lot of bodies.
More than I can even count.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.758
I'm in no hurry
to do that again.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.303
Maybe we'll get an army there
and it will scare

39:49.345 --> 39:50.679
the Blackbloods
into making peace.

39:50.721 --> 39:54.558
- How does that sound?
- Sounds tricky.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.771
Munt, Rosmund has sent me
on a mission to get an army,

39:58.813 --> 40:00.981
and that's what
I'm going to do, okay?

40:01.023 --> 40:03.359
She's a smart woman.
She's not going to do anything

40:03.401 --> 40:05.194
that's gonna get people killed
unless she has to.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.365
- She is a smart queen.
- She's amazing,

40:09.407 --> 40:11.784
and I'll do anything for her,
even if it kills me.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.995
Yeah. Ah-ha! There it is.

40:15.037 --> 40:16.539
The road to Aegisford.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.386
- Right about here.
- This can't be right.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.805
This is the Smith's place.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.723
The man who knew all about
our prophecies and histories?

40:34.765 --> 40:37.893
Wily old bastard.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.813
He must have known. He had to.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.022
It should be right beneath us.

41:02.209 --> 41:03.127
Janzo?

41:07.089 --> 41:09.842
- What is she doing here?
- He is good!

41:09.884 --> 41:13.971
So bloody genius. Come on!

41:17.600 --> 41:19.101
Oh, amazing.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.771
How didn't I know
this was there?

41:22.813 --> 41:26.233
Why would you know
to dig under two feet of sand
in a blacksmith's pit?

41:26.275 --> 41:27.943
More symbols.
More Yindrian symbols.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.114
Don't! Aah!

41:32.156 --> 41:34.575
( shouting )

41:45.211 --> 41:47.838
Do one of you
want to explain to me
what this is?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.840
This is what we've been
searching for, cousin.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.095
This is what
will free us all.
