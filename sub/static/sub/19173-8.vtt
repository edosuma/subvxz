00:16.117 --> 00:19.453
Lend us your help
and we will do whatever
must be done

00:19.553 --> 00:21.055
to move Nassau forward.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.058
She agreed.
Madam Guthrie.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.727
Everything we want for Nassau.

00:26.827 --> 00:31.031
But Flint...
she wants him dead
and she wants me to do it.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.068
They all turned on me,
and I want them all
to pay for it.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.771
I tried once,
but I didn't possess
the instrument to make it work.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.109
You do.
Nothing justifies
trading her life for your war.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.311
No one is saying
that we let her die.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.114
You cannot
guarantee that...
We will sail to Nassau.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.416
And we will find her
and we will bring her home.

00:48.516 --> 00:52.052
You're confident in his plan
maybe because it's a good plan.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.589
But maybe you'll have to
show him that you're prepared
for the failure

00:55.689 --> 00:58.192
and that a treasure
he wanted left in the ground...

00:59.260 --> 01:01.162
ain't in the ground no more.

04:51.859 --> 04:55.763
Seemed only fair
that I remind you that
our fates are now linked.

04:55.863 --> 04:59.600
If this plan
to secure the cache
ends badly for me,

04:59.700 --> 05:02.936
you can be certain
it will end badly for you.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.916
It was where I said
it would be, was it?

05:29.497 --> 05:32.232
That's how close
Mr. Gates was
to Flint.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.603
Stored his most prized
possessions in his cellar.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.672
Avery's journals.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.675
Despite that measure of trust,

05:41.775 --> 05:44.244
all it took
was a disagreement
over a little money

05:44.445 --> 05:46.046
for Flint to kill him.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.051
There are no two people
close enough

05:51.151 --> 05:53.621
that something
cannot separate them.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.492
Some point at which
they were never fully
connected to begin with.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.637
It happened
with Gates and Flint.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.975
It will happen
with Flint and Silver.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.124
This plan will work.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.062
You want the exchange
of the money to happen
off this island,

06:35.162 --> 06:36.997
somewhere no one
need know of it.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.167
There it is.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.972
You'll lead them there

06:45.072 --> 06:47.040
and they will follow you.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.017
Kofi and his men
are on their way to Nassau.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.522
What happens after this?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.256
They'll use resistance routes

07:36.356 --> 07:39.092
to evade detection
by the governor's soldiers.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.595
They're probably already
nearing town by now.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.031
They'll find friends there,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.166
discover through them
where Madi is being held,

07:46.266 --> 07:49.537
and be back to the beach
for us to recover by morning.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.404
Once we know where she is,

07:51.539 --> 07:52.973
we'll move to get her
out of there.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.776
What happens after all of it?

07:57.277 --> 08:00.948
Assume your plan succeeds

08:01.048 --> 08:03.584
and we retrieve her alive.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.619
Assume your war begins...

08:06.820 --> 08:09.022
spreads throughout
the New World.

08:10.658 --> 08:14.061
I saw what came of Nassau
when it was touched by it.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.131
In the first instant,

08:18.231 --> 08:22.670
it was deprived of
Eleanor Guthrie's commerce

08:22.770 --> 08:25.038
or Jack Rackham's prosperity

08:25.138 --> 08:27.174
or Woodes Rogers' oppression.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.579
There's nothing
in Nassau but horror.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.583
You said it was
just a transition.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.688
That something better
lay beyond it,

08:40.788 --> 08:42.990
something meaningful.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.595
But what if that isn't so?

08:50.130 --> 08:54.001
What if the result of this war
isn't beyond the horror?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.706
What if it is the horror itself?

09:02.610 --> 09:05.078
Have you given this
any thought at all?

09:28.902 --> 09:33.006
If we are to truly
reach a moment

09:33.106 --> 09:34.975
where we might be
finished with England...

09:38.178 --> 09:40.848
cleared away to make room
for something else...

09:44.818 --> 09:49.122
there most certainly lies
a dark moment between
here and there.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.928
A moment of terror

09:55.028 --> 09:57.497
where everything appears
to be without hope.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.132
I know this.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.139
But I cannot believe that
that is all there is.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.047
I cannot believe we are
so poorly made as that.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.153
Incapable of surviving
in the state to which
we are born.

10:22.455 --> 10:27.160
Grown so used to the yoke
that there can be no
progress without it.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.268
It's a lot to ask...

10:36.837 --> 10:40.307
to wager
so much suffering
on blind faith.

10:40.407 --> 10:46.013
Well, it isn't entirely faith.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.016
We'll have the right people
in place to lead us through it

10:49.116 --> 10:52.219
and hold the world together
while it finds its balance.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.990
You think so much
of what you and I can
accomplish together.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.759
You and her.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.733
You and Madi.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.937
She's as wise as her father.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.406
She's as strong as her mother.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.609
There isn't a man
or woman in Nassau

11:16.744 --> 11:19.112
who'd argue that she isn't
the best of them all.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.753
The cache is
critical to our war,
but so is she.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.757
Critical to holding
our alliance together.

11:31.825 --> 11:35.395
We absolutely
must get her back alive.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.166
And you think
I'm the one best suited

11:39.266 --> 11:41.769
to lead our people through this?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.773
I think that you are
the best of us.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.312
The two of you together
are the world in balance.

11:54.848 --> 11:58.451
For all the damage Billy's done,
at least he got that right.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.970
Better.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.508
Sorry I was not here
to do this yesterday.

12:21.608 --> 12:25.512
The meetings with
Madam Guthrie and her man
grow longer every day.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.883
I believe I am
gaining her trust.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.285
I believe
I have persuaded them
our proposal is sound,

12:32.385 --> 12:34.888
and still
the questions continue.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.825
But I feel as though
something is coming,

12:37.891 --> 12:40.660
a moment in which
this will cease
to be our idea

12:40.828 --> 12:42.395
and become her own.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.835
If I am able
to reach that moment

12:47.935 --> 12:50.437
and emerge from it
a true partner to her,

12:50.537 --> 12:53.673
if Jack is able to fulfill
his end of the bargain,

12:53.841 --> 12:56.309
I am beginning to see
a future for us in which...

13:00.313 --> 13:02.215
Why are you doing this?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.420
Talking about us
like it's a thing?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.324
A future?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.228
I don't know who broke it first.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.066
But it broke.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.904
And there ain't
no putting it back
together again.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.955
Are you all right?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.765
Wait.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.334
Is there something you need?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.669
Yeah.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.772
There is.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.124
They waited an hour
before disbanding.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.029
Evidently, that is the lifespan
of "the governor is on his way"

14:22.129 --> 14:24.131
as a viable measure of delay.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.303
The solution to our problems
is not going to come from
a council meeting.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.273
They are losing faith in you.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.112
They see the problems we face
in rebuilding this colony,

14:39.212 --> 14:41.481
the dangers if we fail.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.701
And they are
growing more and more
skeptical by the day

14:43.750 --> 14:45.953
that you have anything
in the way of a solution.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.023
My fear is it's worse than that.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.496
My fear is
they will learn what
your solution actually is.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.970
I know you intend to
ransom away that slave woman

15:03.003 --> 15:04.671
to Captain Flint
and his maroon allies

15:04.771 --> 15:07.975
in exchange
for the pirates'
cache of gems.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.111
As brazenly as you pursued
this bargain,

15:11.211 --> 15:13.846
did you really believe
that no one would find out
about it,

15:14.047 --> 15:15.082
that I wouldn't find out?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.323
My wife made the bargain
for the cache, Mr. Soames.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.493
All I'm going to do is collect.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.828
The pirates are gone, sir.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.663
The threat that
they presented us
is done!

15:30.763 --> 15:33.566
The threat
the pirates present
has never been greater.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.835
Their intent is to cause
terror and destruction

15:36.003 --> 15:38.305
until civilization
simply ceases to function.

15:38.405 --> 15:42.342
The threat will not...
The defense of civilization
is not your responsibility, sir!

15:44.577 --> 15:48.348
Your duty is to restore
stable profits to Nassau.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.917
And the men charged
to follow you to that end

15:51.018 --> 15:53.386
are already questioning
their trust in you.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.189
If they see pirates return here,

15:56.289 --> 15:59.359
if they see skirmishes
begin again on this island

15:59.459 --> 16:01.419
and they know
that it was because
you invited it...

16:02.795 --> 16:06.399
then you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands, sir.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.374
"I fear for my husband's safety

17:21.473 --> 17:24.211
"from men I've long
called enemies,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.579
"from men I once called friends.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.616
"I will move
heaven and earth
to protect him,

17:29.716 --> 17:33.353
but while playing this role,
the limits of my influence
are ever-present."

17:38.725 --> 17:43.130
I was just
packing everything away
as you asked, my lord.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.133
Ready my things.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.301
I sail at first light.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.590
She must've
slipped in behind us
during the night.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.627
She's already at anchor.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.998
Looks like she's been
waiting for us.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.068
It looks like she knew
where to wait for us.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.238
Jesus Christ!
On their rail!

18:33.413 --> 18:34.847
He caught them.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.883
How's that possible?
Overnight?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.249
All up on deck!

19:36.709 --> 19:38.578
Back the fore-topsails.
Bring us about.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.747
Back the fore-topsails!
Gun crews at the ready!

19:40.847 --> 19:43.316
Bring us about!
What are you doing?

19:43.416 --> 19:45.856
We bring our guns to bear,
he'll think twice about
killing her.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.520
Belay that order!

19:47.620 --> 19:48.955
Belay that order!

19:51.458 --> 19:53.460
Go get it.
Bring it up here
right now.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.266
Go get what?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.574
What did you bring with us?

20:07.674 --> 20:10.877
Your plan failed.
We're moving onto my plan.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.546
Do not repeat your order.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.681
Do not think about it.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.405
Bring it up here.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.509
Get it where they can see it.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.854
Signal him.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.290
Go!

20:59.125 --> 21:01.328
Signal the Eurydice.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.695
Do it now!

21:02.795 --> 21:04.531
Strike the bell!

21:15.908 --> 21:16.976
Open it.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.288
- He's hauling up the anchor.
- Where the fuck is he going?

22:02.389 --> 22:04.757
Wherever he's going,
we follow him.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.572
This should be good.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.686
What is it I can do
for our lord governor?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.955
I don't come on behalf
of the governor, ma'am.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.893
You are Governor Rogers'
woman, are you not?

22:40.993 --> 22:45.131
I am, which is why
I believe you and I
may be able to help each other.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.739
Really, ma'am,
someplace private
may be more appropriate.

22:54.507 --> 22:58.277
Privacy always comes
with a price, dear.

22:58.445 --> 23:01.448
Let's see what it is
you have to say first,
shall we?

23:03.650 --> 23:06.018
I'm sure you would, yeah.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.894
The governor moves in a dark
and destructive direction.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.465
His grief and his anger...

23:20.099 --> 23:23.836
I believe,
have unmoored him
from sound judgment

23:23.936 --> 23:27.474
and have left us
all in grave danger
if he is not reined in.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.542
You've noticed this, have you?

23:33.480 --> 23:35.582
You were excluded
from the council.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.487
On the outside
of its goings-on.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.956
I don't know
what information
you were privy to...

23:44.056 --> 23:45.858
I appreciate your concern.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.561
Come back when you like.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.063
I may be able to help you
get back inside.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.868
Back on the council?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.175
Go on.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.785
I found a journal Eleanor kept.

24:15.622 --> 24:20.192
In it, she mentioned that
when Nassau last threatened
to descend into chaos...

24:22.762 --> 24:26.032
you were the one
to whom she turned
to help prevent it.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.870
The men surrounding the governor

24:30.970 --> 24:35.041
now have all failed
to challenge him in
any meaningful way.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.210
I am hoping that
if I could provide you

24:38.310 --> 24:41.781
with information
from inside his office...

24:41.881 --> 24:44.751
it might help you
maneuver your way
back onto the council.

24:46.786 --> 24:50.156
That sounds an awful lot
like treason to me.

24:52.759 --> 24:56.162
And what exactly,
aside from good government,

24:56.262 --> 24:58.798
do you hope to gain
from this, hmm?

25:05.805 --> 25:08.908
Eleanor promised me
passage to London.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.079
A release from my service,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.047
that I might return home.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.251
If I help you...

25:21.087 --> 25:22.922
will you help me?

25:41.107 --> 25:43.610
When you asked me
if I could help you learn

25:43.676 --> 25:44.977
where the governor's
ship went...

25:46.345 --> 25:49.248
to what place he drew
Captain Flint,

25:49.348 --> 25:51.984
I thought it unlikely
I could be of much help.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.158
But you will never believe
what just walked
through my door.

26:08.835 --> 26:11.503
Is that not it?
What?

26:11.638 --> 26:13.348
We don't seem to be
preparing for a landing.

26:13.372 --> 26:16.042
Is that not
our destination ahead?

26:16.142 --> 26:17.910
No, it isn't.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.713
It's a waypoint.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.015
Two features on that island
are the markers.

26:23.115 --> 26:27.086
Maybe two peaks
or some points along
the coast.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.346
You run a line through them,
and that direction becomes

26:29.388 --> 26:32.258
the course
the governor will set to reach
our final destination.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.429
How do you know that?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.101
I don't understand.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.870
If the governor knows
our destination,

26:43.970 --> 26:47.740
why can't he just
plot a course directly
to a spot on the chart?

26:47.840 --> 26:51.143
Because Skeleton Island
is not on any chart,

26:51.243 --> 26:54.881
not on any civilized one,
at any rate.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.717
Remote.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.720
Well outside any
established trade route.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.822
It's been used from time to time

27:02.922 --> 27:07.727
for transactions
neither party wished
would ever be acknowledged.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.034
Of course I love her.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.803
I let you try it your way!

27:16.903 --> 27:18.805
I did trust you.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.240
But I'm through wagering
with her life now.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.176
If what it takes
to secure her release
is to turn over the cache,

27:24.276 --> 27:26.045
I'm very glad
I brought it with us.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.816
We had it.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.184
We had it in our hands.

27:32.284 --> 27:35.722
This war was breathing air,
it was alive.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.356
Now Julius is back in that camp,

27:37.456 --> 27:38.925
pointing to a hole
in the ground,

27:39.025 --> 27:40.265
telling anyone who will listen,

27:40.359 --> 27:43.229
"This is what it looks like
when you trust a pirate."

27:43.329 --> 27:45.297
Yesterday, he had nothing.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.800
He was shouting at the rain.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.737
Now you've given him
all he needs to kill
this war dead.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.005
My God.

27:53.105 --> 27:56.375
The number of times
I have followed you blindly,

27:56.475 --> 27:57.844
backed you with the men blindly,

27:57.944 --> 28:00.179
put men in the fucking ground...

28:00.279 --> 28:03.750
good men, friends...
because you said,
"I know the way.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.251
Don't ask me how.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.653
Just do as I say."

28:07.754 --> 28:09.732
I may not have understood it,
I may not have supported it,

28:09.756 --> 28:11.390
but I did it!

28:11.490 --> 28:14.393
And God damn it,
right now you're going
to return the favor!

28:16.262 --> 28:18.464
We will find a way
to put it all back together

28:18.564 --> 28:22.001
with whatever we have left
at our disposal.

28:22.101 --> 28:26.605
But do not ask me to choose
between a war and a wife.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.175
I do not think you're
going to like the answer.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.848
Whatever must be done
to secure Madi's release,

28:35.948 --> 28:37.483
I'm going to do it.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.620
I do not expect
your understanding,

28:41.788 --> 28:43.956
but I demand your support.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.794
As my partner,

28:47.894 --> 28:49.395
as my friend.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.066
Do I have it?

28:59.305 --> 29:01.440
Do I have it?

29:10.449 --> 29:12.184
Yes.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.417
I got what you asked.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.960
These are
the ships either in port
or soon expected to be

31:01.060 --> 31:03.429
and willing
to accept passengers.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.104
You really intend to leave...

31:13.940 --> 31:15.607
whether Jack
returns alive or not?

31:17.176 --> 31:19.111
Jack will return.

31:20.412 --> 31:23.315
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.584
Chances are good
you've seen the last of him.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.266
You killed a friend of mine.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.303
Her name was Charlotte...

31:45.972 --> 31:48.607
and you did it
for reasons that
had nothing to do with her.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.981
There were men I knew that
would've killed you for me.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.018
I wanted to ask them.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.520
Had the money.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.591
But Max refused.

32:08.394 --> 32:12.298
I couldn't tell then
if it was because she was
afraid of you.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.234
Wouldn't have blamed her.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.502
I was.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.539
Or if it was something else.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.145
But I respected her wishes.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.815
Obeyed when
she said we'd protect you
despite what you'd done.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.483
Do you know why?

32:34.086 --> 32:37.223
Because despite
the world reminding her
every day of her life

32:37.323 --> 32:41.093
that she's undeserving
of being given anything by it,

32:41.193 --> 32:44.363
that she was unworthy of
what little she'd managed
to take from it...

32:45.597 --> 32:48.267
despite all of that,

32:48.367 --> 32:50.436
she never believed a word of it.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.041
That woman
has been fighting
the whole goddamn world

32:55.107 --> 32:56.742
since the day she was born.

32:58.844 --> 33:01.047
She's a breath away
from winning that fight.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.885
For whatever reason,

33:07.053 --> 33:09.421
she wants to share
the spoils with you.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.126
And you'd walk away.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.332
You killed my friend.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.702
I wanted you to know that.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.391
We are not going
to Mr. Grace's library.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.467
I understood there was
someone you wanted me
to meet there today.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.469
Has something changed?

34:47.152 --> 34:50.222
Walk with me.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.772
Those are the pirates.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.007
They've inhabited the east bank,

35:09.175 --> 35:12.311
across from
Springett Island for years.

35:12.411 --> 35:15.347
The governor promises
this is the year he'll
chase them off,

35:15.447 --> 35:17.416
but there they are.

35:19.751 --> 35:23.222
Seven major shipping concerns
in the city here.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.493
In less than 10 years,
more goods will move
through here

35:27.593 --> 35:30.729
than any
English-speaking port
outside London.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.266
There will be civilization here.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.336
Where will the pirates be?

35:39.438 --> 35:43.342
On the east bank,
across from Springett Island.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.644
Why?

35:45.744 --> 35:47.313
Because the shipping concern

35:47.413 --> 35:51.317
charges a premium for the risk
the pirates present.

35:51.417 --> 35:54.486
I assume the governor, too,
profits from this.

35:54.586 --> 35:58.524
There is theft,
but everyone benefits.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.892
Why would anyone want to end it?

36:04.730 --> 36:07.433
How well did you know
my granddaughter?

36:10.602 --> 36:12.738
I knew her well.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.540
Was she happy?

36:16.242 --> 36:17.676
Happy?

36:17.776 --> 36:19.978
There are things
I know about Nassau,

36:20.246 --> 36:22.113
about her.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.950
There are things that
are harder to know
across an ocean.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.455
I honestly do not know.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.726
Her grandfather
disowned her some time ago,

36:34.826 --> 36:39.698
assumed she'd simply
become one with the wild men.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.633
When the trial began

36:41.733 --> 36:46.037
and Guthrie became
a contemptible name
to utter in London,

36:46.272 --> 36:47.839
didn't help matters.

36:49.341 --> 36:53.312
But I held out hope
from the beginning.

36:53.412 --> 36:57.516
A fantasy that despite
what we'd heard of her,

36:57.616 --> 37:00.552
she was learning, growing.

37:02.288 --> 37:05.957
And that someday,
she'd seek me out and...

37:06.057 --> 37:10.396
a woman who reminded me
of myself when I was younger
would arrive in Boston

37:10.496 --> 37:14.165
and I'd walk
the Charles with her

37:14.300 --> 37:18.937
and teach her
the things a woman
can do in this world.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.676
It's the wrong river
and the wrong woman,

37:24.776 --> 37:29.014
but perhaps to
get even this close
to a fantasy is something.

37:30.749 --> 37:35.487
So, let us assume that
we're past conversations
about ledgers

37:35.587 --> 37:39.425
and that the measuring of you
and your proposal are done

37:39.525 --> 37:43.429
and that we are partners
in a venture

37:43.529 --> 37:47.333
to acquire and reform Nassau.

37:49.335 --> 37:52.871
So, now all that's left
to know about this venture

37:52.971 --> 37:54.940
is who is going to lead it.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.185
Edward Houghton.

38:07.353 --> 38:11.357
The only male heir
to his family's banking
operation.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.992
Supremely uncurious,

38:14.092 --> 38:17.028
bordering on dim,
but fundamentally decent.

38:17.128 --> 38:21.567
The investments he's overseen
have shown modest gains at best

38:21.667 --> 38:24.370
and losses more frequently.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.673
This is not the man
you would like to put
in charge of Nassau.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.444
I'd like to put you
in charge of Nassau.

38:32.544 --> 38:37.416
But on this particular issue,
the world won't much care
for what I'd like.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.986
And of the men available,
this one has merits.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.922
His family would be
relieved beyond measure

38:44.022 --> 38:47.926
that he'd found himself
a future far away from
their business.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.096
He'd come with money,

38:51.196 --> 38:53.399
he'd open doors
to new partners...

38:55.066 --> 38:59.405
and he'd be most amenable
to doing whatever else
you told him to do.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.775
You think he would
listen to me as an advisor?

39:13.419 --> 39:15.687
You think he would
listen to me as a wife.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.265
I suppose it needn't be him.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.568
But to have
the kind of control
you will need to have,

39:29.668 --> 39:33.439
there will need to be
someone occupying the role,

39:33.472 --> 39:38.444
and that someone solves
a number of problems
all at once.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.813
Money, limited ambition...

39:43.449 --> 39:45.851
and reform-minded
parents

39:45.951 --> 39:48.487
would find your story
most intriguing.

39:53.925 --> 39:58.464
In terms of
your obligations to him,

39:58.497 --> 40:00.566
there are plenty of ways
for a man like that

40:00.666 --> 40:04.436
to retain satisfaction
in a place like Nassau

40:04.536 --> 40:07.005
with little
or no participation
from you.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.408
You'd likely retain
as much freedom

40:10.509 --> 40:12.944
in that regard as you desired.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.049
To rise from where you began

40:18.149 --> 40:19.751
to where you now stand,

40:19.851 --> 40:22.754
I cannot imagine
the road you've traveled.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.525
The humiliations

40:26.625 --> 40:29.194
and the sacrifices

40:29.427 --> 40:30.862
and the defeats...

40:32.197 --> 40:33.965
and the illusions maintained

40:34.065 --> 40:37.202
at so great a cost
to your sense of self.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.974
But that road has led you to me.

40:44.576 --> 40:48.614
I am the gate
through which your journey
becomes something else.

40:49.781 --> 40:53.051
I can make the dreams
you have built real.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.828
The toll is small,
but it must be paid.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.164
Tell me you're ready
to pay it...

41:07.599 --> 41:09.701
and you and I
will walk downstairs,

41:09.801 --> 41:12.403
I will introduce you to him,

41:12.538 --> 41:16.207
and... as I imagine,
you'll have no difficulty
taking things from there.

41:18.109 --> 41:22.648
Our partnership
may move forward
fully formed.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.887
Are you ready to do it?

41:39.698 --> 41:43.569
That is a very old man.

41:43.602 --> 41:48.406
The governor's woman
overheard his ship was
bound for Skeleton Island.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.577
That man, I have it
on good authority,

41:51.643 --> 41:55.213
is the last man on this island
once sailed with Avery.

41:55.313 --> 41:58.016
Claims to have been
to Skeleton Island

41:58.116 --> 41:59.785
and can show us the way.

42:02.688 --> 42:03.955
And you believe he can do it?

42:05.290 --> 42:07.926
Two possible outcomes
as far as I can tell.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.661
One, he fails,

42:09.761 --> 42:11.897
in which case
we sail around
till we tire of it,

42:11.997 --> 42:13.965
then go back to the camp.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.101
Or two,

42:16.201 --> 42:20.005
by some miracle,
he actually succeeds
in getting us there.

42:22.708 --> 42:26.377
And I can't tell
which of the two
is of more concern.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.113
What does that mean?

42:28.213 --> 42:31.617
Killing Flint
was already going to be
a near impossible feat.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.886
Now we need
to evade the governor
and his soldiers as well.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.456
Wouldn't it make
a whole lot more sense

42:38.624 --> 42:40.692
to just wait for the governor
to kill him for us?

42:40.792 --> 42:42.628
If Woodes Rogers
secures that cache,

42:42.728 --> 42:45.631
he secures
his position here
as well.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.999
Negates our plan
to see him removed.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.534
He wins.

42:49.635 --> 42:53.204
Yeah, but...
Everything we need
is on that island.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.173
Flint, Rogers,

42:55.273 --> 42:59.077
and my cache of gems.

42:59.177 --> 43:01.713
If that very old man
over there can get us there...

43:03.815 --> 43:05.817
why are we still standing here?

43:27.072 --> 43:29.941
If you leave him alive
long enough,

43:30.041 --> 43:32.744
he's going to
make you pay for it.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.983
He won't move against me.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.887
This will pass.

43:43.354 --> 43:46.057
And that's the end
of this conversation.

43:48.827 --> 43:51.096
So many lies

43:51.196 --> 43:53.398
to deny a simple truth.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.401
What?

43:57.703 --> 43:59.905
The crown does not divide.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.606
It cannot be shared.

44:01.707 --> 44:03.775
You know it.
You want it done.

44:03.875 --> 44:06.311
You just don't know
how to ask yet.

44:14.352 --> 44:16.221
Hear me very clearly.

44:17.789 --> 44:20.992
There is no hidden message
and no equivocation.

44:22.527 --> 44:25.096
You will make
no move against him.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.898
You will not speak of doing so

44:26.998 --> 44:30.001
to any man on this crew
nor to me again.

44:31.102 --> 44:34.806
Do it and you'll answer for it.

45:00.298 --> 45:01.933
Fuck you doing out here?

45:03.468 --> 45:06.171
It's a fucking mess out here.
Come inside.

45:10.108 --> 45:11.542
Or don't.

45:12.844 --> 45:14.112
I don't care.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.015
It happened.

45:19.417 --> 45:24.255
She has committed
to the plan, to me.

45:24.355 --> 45:27.993
The moment we have
been working towards
since we arrived...

45:29.227 --> 45:30.962
it happened.

45:33.131 --> 45:35.000
That's good news.

45:38.369 --> 45:40.338
So, why do you look like that?

45:40.438 --> 45:44.142
I told her
I could not agree to it.

45:44.242 --> 45:47.012
You told her no?

45:47.112 --> 45:51.449
She needs for there to be
a man in the governor's office,
not Jack.

45:51.549 --> 45:55.921
A man of her choosing,
and she wants me
to be his wife.

45:56.021 --> 45:57.923
His wife?!

45:58.023 --> 46:02.360
In name only and for
appearance's sake,
nothing more.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.896
The power would rest with us.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.434
Just for appearance?

46:11.569 --> 46:13.171
And you said no?

46:15.073 --> 46:16.975
Why would you do that?

46:22.580 --> 46:24.950
I remember when
I first met Eleanor,

46:25.050 --> 46:26.952
how stunned I was.

46:27.052 --> 46:29.955
A woman who spoke
the way she did,

46:30.055 --> 46:33.358
who had no fear of the world
or the men who reigned over it.

46:33.458 --> 46:36.862
When I became her lover,
I watched the decisions
she made...

46:38.163 --> 46:39.965
and resolved to learn from them.

46:41.432 --> 46:44.135
When I became her rival,
I watched the mistakes
she made

46:44.235 --> 46:46.571
and resolved
never to repeat them.

46:46.872 --> 46:48.339
But at the end,

46:48.439 --> 46:52.577
when I felt I had
surpassed her in every way,

46:52.677 --> 46:57.082
it seemed as though
there was something she was
still trying to say to me.

46:59.885 --> 47:04.589
Surrendering everything
she had sacrificed
so dearly for,

47:04.689 --> 47:08.259
because it would have
come at the expense of
the one she loved.

47:10.128 --> 47:13.198
She was trying to tell me,
I just could not hear her,

47:13.298 --> 47:15.500
about what is truly important.

47:17.202 --> 47:19.938
I said no
to Marion Guthrie's plan...

47:21.506 --> 47:23.408
despite having no alternative

47:23.508 --> 47:27.745
and at the risk of losing
the entire endeavor

47:27.913 --> 47:31.482
because I refuse
to situate a man
in a position

47:31.582 --> 47:33.784
where he might interfere one day

47:33.919 --> 47:37.222
with my ability
to repair things with you.

47:46.431 --> 47:50.301
You are the bravest person
I have ever known.

47:52.938 --> 47:56.174
The truest person
I have ever known.

47:58.009 --> 48:01.146
And I betrayed you
and it sickens me.

48:10.621 --> 48:14.559
I am so sorry
for working so hard
to protect the wrong things.

48:16.227 --> 48:19.130
For failing to see that
there is nothing important

48:19.230 --> 48:21.432
that does not include you.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.098
The story,
as it was recounted to me,

49:27.198 --> 49:31.602
is that Avery was
the first Englishman
to find the island.

49:34.539 --> 49:38.509
The Spanish had been
using it to conduct illicit
transactions for decades.

49:40.045 --> 49:42.147
Avery plans to lie
in wait for them.

49:42.247 --> 49:46.251
He and his crew of 44 arrive

49:46.351 --> 49:47.818
and sail inland.

49:56.127 --> 49:57.895
But as they move up the inlet,

49:58.063 --> 50:01.166
they see something
most unexpected.

50:08.473 --> 50:11.042
She was Spanish,

50:11.142 --> 50:14.245
but not one of the ships
they'd been hunting.

50:14.345 --> 50:17.315
This ship had been there
far longer than that.

50:19.617 --> 50:22.453
Captain's log identifies her
having set sail

50:22.553 --> 50:25.890
from Havana in 1636.

50:26.124 --> 50:29.327
31 souls aboard.

50:29.427 --> 50:32.397
Avery finds
the remains of all 31.

50:33.631 --> 50:35.166
Slaughtered.

50:35.266 --> 50:37.635
Brutally so.

50:37.735 --> 50:39.204
Evidence that a number of them

50:39.304 --> 50:42.507
had been dismembered
while still alive.

50:43.741 --> 50:45.643
There were natives
on the island?

50:45.743 --> 50:50.081
All 31 bodies were found
still on the ship,

50:50.181 --> 50:52.049
locked inside the hold.

50:53.118 --> 50:54.619
Locked from within.

50:56.487 --> 50:58.523
They ate each other alive.

51:01.426 --> 51:05.563
Avery claimed
to have seen the log.

51:05.663 --> 51:09.134
It said that the crew
had refused to go inland

51:09.167 --> 51:10.835
to forage for food
or for fresh water.

51:13.871 --> 51:15.806
That the first men in
had returned,

51:15.906 --> 51:18.676
reporting sounds
coming from the forest.

51:22.547 --> 51:25.283
The men said it sounded to them

51:25.383 --> 51:27.285
like the voice of God...

51:29.354 --> 51:31.389
warning them to stay away.

52:01.619 --> 52:05.523
It's an open question
how much of this story
Avery invented.

52:05.623 --> 52:08.726
But what is undeniably true

52:08.826 --> 52:12.263
is how undeniably effective
that story has been

52:12.363 --> 52:14.632
in achieving a result.

52:24.709 --> 52:26.344
Captain...

52:27.812 --> 52:31.216
It's no accident
that Billy chose it.

52:31.282 --> 52:35.220
A place likely
to put us all
out of balance,

52:35.253 --> 52:38.055
where our imaginations
might run wild

52:38.223 --> 52:40.625
and our darkest impulses

52:40.725 --> 52:45.363
somehow made far more
difficult to resist.

52:46.964 --> 52:49.234
If we are to survive
this experience...

52:50.368 --> 52:53.070
if our cause is to survive,

52:53.238 --> 52:56.907
some of us must find a way
to keep our wits about us

52:57.007 --> 52:59.277
on behalf of those who cannot.

52:59.377 --> 53:02.447
See the truth ahead of us

53:02.547 --> 53:05.450
through the fear and the haze.

53:07.252 --> 53:10.321
Mr. Silver, I fear,

53:10.421 --> 53:13.258
is compromised in this regard.

53:14.625 --> 53:16.261
At this moment...

53:18.463 --> 53:21.832
I find myself in need
of a new partner.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.698
I knew it would come to this.

54:28.966 --> 54:30.601
I tried to tell him.

54:36.907 --> 54:39.377
We fight,

54:39.477 --> 54:42.447
only two outcomes I can see...

54:42.547 --> 54:45.850
I die or you die.

54:45.950 --> 54:49.854
Either way,
he's gonna take me
to blame for it.

54:51.422 --> 54:54.392
That's how far you've
burrowed into his head.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.862
He won't put you out of it

54:57.962 --> 55:00.965
until he sees you
for what you are.

55:06.904 --> 55:08.839
Go.

55:45.776 --> 55:47.645
Do you see it now?

55:56.921 --> 55:58.823
Do you see it?

56:01.626 --> 56:03.428
Prepare a launch.

56:41.466 --> 56:43.734
Captain Flint
killed one of my men

56:43.834 --> 56:46.170
and managed to haul
the cache to shore.

56:47.472 --> 56:48.473
I came in the hopes

56:48.539 --> 56:50.174
my presence
might buy us some time

56:50.274 --> 56:52.009
before you reacted
to this news...

56:53.277 --> 56:56.914
and until I am able
to remedy the situation.

56:57.014 --> 56:59.717
What sort of remedy is that?

57:06.791 --> 57:08.959
I sent six of my men after him.

57:10.561 --> 57:13.030
The best men I have left.

57:13.130 --> 57:17.535
Their orders,
in no uncertain terms,

57:17.635 --> 57:20.070
are to track Captain Flint

57:20.170 --> 57:21.706
and retrieve the cache.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.509
There was another order...

57:28.946 --> 57:30.515
wasn't there?

57:36.186 --> 57:37.655
Yes.

57:39.023 --> 57:41.559
What else did you
tell them to do?

58:03.648 --> 58:06.617
I instructed them
to kill Captain Flint.
