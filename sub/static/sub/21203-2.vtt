WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.037
ELLARIA: The Lannisters have
declared war on house Tyrell.

00:07.038 --> 00:08.288
They have declared war
on Dorne.

00:08.580 --> 00:11.788
We must be allies now,
if we wish to survive.

00:12.329 --> 00:14.872
I offer vengeance...
justice...

00:15.329 --> 00:16.705
Fire and blood.

00:18.538 --> 00:19.579
SAM: I traveled south

00:19.580 --> 00:21.329
under orders
from the Lord Commander.

00:21.663 --> 00:23.663
RANDYLL:
You ought to be a Maester.

00:23.872 --> 00:26.078
Spending your life reading
about the achievements

00:26.079 --> 00:27.204
of better men.

00:27.580 --> 00:29.078
SAM: It's a map of Dragonstone.

00:29.079 --> 00:30.204
GILLY: That's dragonglass.

00:30.455 --> 00:31.895
A mountain of it,
beneath the ground.

00:32.037 --> 00:33.204
John needs to know.

00:33.955 --> 00:34.955
You must send me away.

00:35.204 --> 00:37.120
I command you to heal yourself.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.413
I command you to find the cure.

00:46.288 --> 00:49.413
So why's a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

00:49.830 --> 00:51.246
I'm going to kill the queen.

00:52.747 --> 00:54.537
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

00:54.538 --> 00:56.204
the new king
of the Iron Islands.

00:58.663 --> 01:02.079
The Iron Fleet is the greatest
armada Westeros has ever seen.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.287
The surest way to
a woman's heart is with a gift.

01:05.288 --> 01:08.371
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

01:11.413 --> 01:12.413
Shall we begin?

( theme music playing )

03:09.038 --> 03:11.246
( thunder crashing )

03:40.246 --> 03:43.037
Tyrion: On a night like this,
you came into the world.

03:43.038 --> 03:44.328
Varys:
I remember that storm.

03:44.329 --> 03:47.078
All the dogs
in King's Landing

03:47.079 --> 03:49.078
howled through
the night.

03:49.079 --> 03:50.704
I wish I could
remember it.

03:50.705 --> 03:53.620
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

03:53.621 --> 03:55.412
Doesn't feel
like home.

03:55.413 --> 03:57.746
We won't stay
on Dragonstone for long.

03:57.747 --> 03:59.038
Good.

04:00.455 --> 04:02.287
Daenerys:
Not so many lions.

04:02.288 --> 04:05.203
Varys: Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.495
The lords of Westeros
despise her.

04:07.496 --> 04:10.370
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

04:10.371 --> 04:13.871
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

04:13.872 --> 04:16.495
They drink secret toasts
to my health?

04:16.495 --> 04:18.454
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

04:18.454 --> 04:20.495
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

04:25.288 --> 04:29.328
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

04:29.329 --> 04:31.328
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

04:31.329 --> 04:33.912
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

04:33.913 --> 04:36.329
But you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

04:37.955 --> 04:39.078
No.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.328
We can take
the Seven Kingdoms

04:41.329 --> 04:44.203
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

04:44.204 --> 04:46.787
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

04:46.788 --> 04:48.871
the game is won.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.328
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

04:51.329 --> 04:54.495
we have powerful allies
in the south.

04:54.496 --> 04:57.078
I never properly
thanked you for that.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.829
They joined our side,
my queen,

04:59.830 --> 05:02.370
because
they believe in you.

05:02.371 --> 05:04.705
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

05:06.038 --> 05:07.328
I did.

05:07.329 --> 05:08.662
And then you served
the man who overthrew him.

05:08.663 --> 05:10.412
I had a choice,
Your Grace...

05:10.413 --> 05:12.537
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

05:12.538 --> 05:14.871
But you didn't
serve him long.

05:14.872 --> 05:16.329
You turned
against him.

05:17.788 --> 05:21.495
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

05:21.496 --> 05:23.579
There have been
few rulers in history

05:23.580 --> 05:25.662
as cruel
as the Mad King.

05:25.663 --> 05:28.120
Robert was
neither mad nor cruel.

05:28.121 --> 05:30.662
He simply had no interest
in being king.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.370
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

05:33.371 --> 05:35.579
Your Grace,

05:35.580 --> 05:38.579
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

05:38.580 --> 05:40.620
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

05:40.621 --> 05:43.538
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

05:44.955 --> 05:48.245
All your spies,
your little birds,

05:48.246 --> 05:51.913
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

05:54.038 --> 05:58.537
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

05:58.538 --> 06:01.203
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

06:01.204 --> 06:03.704
I knew nothing about you,
save your existence

06:03.705 --> 06:06.037
and that you were said
to be beautiful.

06:06.038 --> 06:09.746
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

06:09.747 --> 06:11.746
Which you turned
to your advantage.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.788
Who gave the order
to kill me?

06:17.788 --> 06:19.829
King Robert.

06:19.830 --> 06:22.579
Who hired
the assassins?

06:22.580 --> 06:25.746
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

06:25.747 --> 06:30.287
- Your Grace, I did what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

06:30.288 --> 06:32.579
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.370
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

06:34.371 --> 06:38.078
If he dislikes one monarch,
he conspires to crown the next one.

06:38.079 --> 06:40.495
What kind of a servant
is that?

06:40.496 --> 06:42.620
The kind
the realm needs.

06:42.621 --> 06:45.996
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

06:45.997 --> 06:48.955
As long as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

06:50.663 --> 06:52.662
I wasn't born
into a great house.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.245
I came from nothing.

06:55.246 --> 06:58.203
I was sold as a slave
and carved up as an offering.

06:58.204 --> 07:02.037
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

07:02.038 --> 07:04.620
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

07:04.621 --> 07:07.829
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

07:07.830 --> 07:11.787
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

07:11.788 --> 07:14.163
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

07:15.955 --> 07:19.871
If you demand
blind allegiance,

07:19.872 --> 07:22.620
I respect your wishes.

07:22.621 --> 07:26.620
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

07:26.621 --> 07:29.203
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

07:29.204 --> 07:32.495
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

07:32.496 --> 07:34.996
because I choose you.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.538
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.997
Swear this to me,
Varys.

07:50.496 --> 07:53.954
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

07:53.955 --> 07:57.162
you won't conspire
behind my back.

07:57.163 --> 07:59.120
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

07:59.121 --> 08:00.955
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.955
I swear it,
my queen.

08:12.288 --> 08:16.203
And I swear this...
if you ever betray me,

08:16.204 --> 08:17.913
I'll burn you alive.

08:21.246 --> 08:24.663
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

08:27.747 --> 08:29.704
Forgive me, my queen.

08:29.705 --> 08:32.871
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

08:47.288 --> 08:49.038
( speaking Valyrian )

09:09.163 --> 09:12.954
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

09:12.955 --> 09:16.871
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

09:16.872 --> 09:18.537
No, it didn't.

09:18.538 --> 09:22.370
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

09:22.371 --> 09:24.245
We've just decided
to pardon those

09:24.246 --> 09:26.913
who once served
the wrong king.

09:30.872 --> 09:34.245
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

09:34.246 --> 09:37.912
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

09:37.913 --> 09:39.412
can serve his cause.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.329
What does your lord
expect from me?

09:47.121 --> 09:49.663
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

09:51.204 --> 09:52.954
I'm afraid
I'm not a prince.

09:52.955 --> 09:54.537
Missandei: Your Grace,
forgive me,

09:54.538 --> 09:57.495
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.245
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

10:00.246 --> 10:03.203
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

10:03.204 --> 10:07.579
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

10:07.580 --> 10:09.746
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

10:09.747 --> 10:11.288
No, but I like it
better.

10:12.872 --> 10:14.829
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

10:14.830 --> 10:17.620
Prophecies are
dangerous things.

10:17.621 --> 10:20.954
I believe you have
a role to play.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.829
As does another...

10:22.830 --> 10:25.329
the King in the North,
Jon Snow.

10:26.621 --> 10:28.037
Jon Snow?

10:28.038 --> 10:30.829
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

10:30.830 --> 10:33.996
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

10:33.997 --> 10:38.120
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

10:38.121 --> 10:40.829
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

10:40.830 --> 10:43.746
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

10:43.747 --> 10:45.996
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

10:45.997 --> 10:48.078
to protect them
from grave danger.

10:48.079 --> 10:49.662
As King in the North,

10:49.663 --> 10:52.495
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

10:52.496 --> 10:54.996
so together they may
face their common enemy.

10:54.997 --> 10:57.120
He sounds like
quite a man.

10:57.121 --> 10:59.495
Summon Jon Snow.

10:59.496 --> 11:01.162
Let him stand
before you

11:01.163 --> 11:02.787
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

11:02.788 --> 11:06.413
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

11:07.955 --> 11:09.579
I can't speak
to prophecies

11:09.580 --> 11:12.203
or visions
in the flames,

11:12.204 --> 11:14.996
but I like Jon Snow
and I trusted him.

11:14.997 --> 11:17.495
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

11:17.496 --> 11:19.954
If he does
rule the North,

11:19.955 --> 11:21.705
he would make
a valuable ally.

11:23.038 --> 11:24.954
The Lannisters
executed his father

11:24.955 --> 11:27.120
and conspired
to murder his brother.

11:27.121 --> 11:30.329
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

11:34.705 --> 11:36.495
Very well.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.287
Send a raven north.

11:38.288 --> 11:40.287
Tell Jon Snow
that his queen

11:40.288 --> 11:43.287
invites him to come
to Dragonstone...

11:43.288 --> 11:45.038
and bend the knee.

11:49.204 --> 11:51.747
( chatter )

11:54.580 --> 11:57.579
Gather round.
Come here.

11:57.580 --> 12:00.078
Sansa: You think
it's really Tyrion?

12:00.079 --> 12:03.579
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

12:03.580 --> 12:05.120
Read the last bit.

12:05.121 --> 12:09.746
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

12:09.747 --> 12:11.495
What does that mean?

12:11.496 --> 12:14.413
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

12:15.747 --> 12:17.580
You know him better
than any of us.

12:18.747 --> 12:19.747
What do you think?

12:23.204 --> 12:25.829
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

12:25.830 --> 12:29.620
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

12:29.621 --> 12:31.620
"The Seven Kingdoms
will bleed

12:31.621 --> 12:34.120
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.287
Join us.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.121
Together, we can
end her tyranny."

12:41.288 --> 12:43.287
Sounds like a charmer.

12:43.288 --> 12:45.495
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

12:45.496 --> 12:48.454
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

12:48.455 --> 12:49.997
a bit less charming.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.162
What?

12:53.163 --> 12:56.412
Fire kills wights,
you told me.

12:56.413 --> 12:57.580
What breathes fire?

12:59.663 --> 13:01.787
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

13:01.788 --> 13:04.203
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

13:04.204 --> 13:07.162
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

13:07.163 --> 13:09.663
do we have enough men
to fight them?

13:13.997 --> 13:16.370
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

13:16.371 --> 13:18.288
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

13:19.621 --> 13:22.537
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

13:22.538 --> 13:25.662
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

13:25.663 --> 13:28.871
With their help,
the Mad King's daughter

13:28.872 --> 13:32.370
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

13:32.371 --> 13:36.162
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

13:36.163 --> 13:40.328
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

13:40.329 --> 13:42.537
rape and enslave
your women,

13:42.538 --> 13:45.454
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

13:45.455 --> 13:50.328
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.162
- ( people murmuring )
- Cersei: You all remember the Mad King.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.704
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.704
His daughter
is no different.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.495
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

14:01.496 --> 14:05.787
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

14:05.788 --> 14:08.454
And when she
grew bored of that,

14:08.455 --> 14:10.704
she fed them
to her dragons.

14:10.705 --> 14:14.287
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

14:14.288 --> 14:17.454
But I need your help,
my lords.

14:17.455 --> 14:20.246
We must stand together,
all of us...

14:21.455 --> 14:23.454
if we hope to stop her.

14:23.455 --> 14:25.163
( all murmuring )

14:28.788 --> 14:31.872
She has three full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

14:33.246 --> 14:35.037
The same as Aegon
when he conquered

14:35.038 --> 14:37.537
the Seven Kingdoms.

14:37.538 --> 14:39.913
How do you propose
to stop them?

14:43.580 --> 14:47.705
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.705
( chatter )

14:54.580 --> 14:55.580
Lord Tarly.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.328
Ser Jaime.

14:59.329 --> 15:01.037
I believe
you know my son.

15:01.038 --> 15:02.038
Ser Jaime.

15:02.039 --> 15:03.537
Rickard, isn't it?

15:03.538 --> 15:05.245
Dickon.

15:05.246 --> 15:06.787
That's it.

15:06.788 --> 15:08.787
Thank you for coming.

15:08.788 --> 15:12.704
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.412
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.704
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

15:17.705 --> 15:20.496
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

15:23.371 --> 15:25.746
You ride for
Horn Hill today?

15:25.747 --> 15:28.454
I have an army
to mobilize.

15:28.455 --> 15:30.787
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

15:30.788 --> 15:33.246
And which side
will you be fighting for?

15:34.830 --> 15:37.579
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.495
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
could do that.

15:39.496 --> 15:42.454
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

15:42.455 --> 15:45.412
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

15:45.413 --> 15:47.537
I want you to swear
allegiance to Cersei

15:47.538 --> 15:50.537
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

15:50.538 --> 15:52.370
All her enemies.

15:52.371 --> 15:54.413
Including
Olenna Tyrell.

15:57.163 --> 15:59.662
I'm a Tarly.

15:59.663 --> 16:01.163
That name
means something.

16:02.663 --> 16:05.203
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

16:05.204 --> 16:07.662
We don't stab
our rivals in the back

16:07.663 --> 16:10.496
or cut their throats
at weddings.

16:12.621 --> 16:15.537
I swore an oath
to House Tyrell.

16:15.538 --> 16:18.872
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

16:20.288 --> 16:22.662
I've known Olenna
since I was a child.

16:22.663 --> 16:25.287
She was
a great woman once.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.662
Now she's broken.

16:27.663 --> 16:29.787
She wants revenge
so badly,

16:29.788 --> 16:32.037
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

16:32.038 --> 16:35.955
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

16:38.621 --> 16:40.871
I know you don't
like my sister,

16:40.872 --> 16:44.037
but you have
to make a choice.

16:44.038 --> 16:46.078
Do you fight with us

16:46.079 --> 16:48.204
or with foreign savages
and eunuchs?

16:53.455 --> 16:55.704
When the war is won,

16:55.705 --> 16:58.871
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

16:58.872 --> 17:01.704
I can think
of no better man

17:01.705 --> 17:03.538
than Randyll Tarly.

17:05.579 --> 17:08.369
Ebrose: The infection
has spread too far.

17:08.371 --> 17:11.329
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

17:14.038 --> 17:15.163
How long?

17:17.913 --> 17:20.037
It'll be years
before it kills you.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.619
Could be 10.

17:21.621 --> 17:23.287
Could be 20.

17:23.288 --> 17:25.038
But how long until...?

17:26.454 --> 17:28.537
Your mind?

17:28.538 --> 17:31.413
Six months,
maybe fewer.

17:38.705 --> 17:39.705
( grunts )

17:44.079 --> 17:45.204
Um...

17:46.747 --> 17:49.912
Pardon, Archmaester.

17:49.913 --> 17:52.912
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

17:52.913 --> 17:55.370
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

17:55.371 --> 17:56.954
- Ebrose: No.
- Isn't there some way...

17:56.955 --> 17:58.746
Ebrose: Does this look
like a baby to you?

17:58.747 --> 18:00.078
- No.
- Have you studied

18:00.079 --> 18:02.120
the varying rates
of greyscale progression

18:02.121 --> 18:03.747
in infants
and fully grown men?

18:05.788 --> 18:07.163
No.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.537
Ebrose:
Maester Cressen discovered

18:10.538 --> 18:13.121
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.288
This is quite advanced.

18:18.121 --> 18:20.329
And beyond
our skills, ser.

18:23.788 --> 18:26.746
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

18:26.747 --> 18:29.287
to live out your life
with the stone men.

18:29.288 --> 18:33.121
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

18:35.913 --> 18:38.455
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

18:44.955 --> 18:45.955
Come, Samwell.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.705
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

18:54.329 --> 18:55.329
Jorah.

18:57.163 --> 18:59.662
Jorah Mormont.

18:59.663 --> 19:01.704
Mormont?

19:01.705 --> 19:03.454
There's no need.

19:03.455 --> 19:06.038
I've been dead
to them for years.

19:07.705 --> 19:09.371
Ebrose:
Come, Samwell!

19:22.329 --> 19:25.245
Qyburn: Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

19:25.246 --> 19:26.747
No, I can't say
I have.

19:28.997 --> 19:32.454
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

19:32.455 --> 19:36.412
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

19:36.413 --> 19:38.579
They were his trophies.

19:38.580 --> 19:39.787
He couldn't
keep them around.

19:39.788 --> 19:41.704
They would have
made him look small.

19:41.705 --> 19:45.246
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

19:47.705 --> 19:50.413
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

19:57.747 --> 19:59.538
Balerion the Dread.

20:01.371 --> 20:03.954
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

20:03.955 --> 20:06.871
His flames forged
the Iron Throne

20:06.872 --> 20:09.747
and brought the Seven
Kingdoms to heel.

20:10.913 --> 20:12.079
Powerful...

20:13.204 --> 20:14.621
but not invincible.

20:19.079 --> 20:22.412
Apparently,
one of Daenerys's dragons

20:22.413 --> 20:26.079
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.912
And if they can
be wounded,

20:29.913 --> 20:31.288
they can be killed.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.579
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

20:36.580 --> 20:39.413
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

20:45.955 --> 20:48.455
If you'll kindly
pull that lever.

21:04.913 --> 21:07.455
Yara: If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

21:09.538 --> 21:12.620
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

21:12.621 --> 21:16.287
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

21:16.288 --> 21:18.787
The city will fall
within a day.

21:18.788 --> 21:21.704
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

21:21.705 --> 21:23.287
It's called war.

21:23.288 --> 21:26.287
You don't have the stomach for it,
scurry back into hiding.

21:26.288 --> 21:27.620
I know
how you wage war.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.370
We don't poison
little girls here.

21:30.371 --> 21:31.662
Myrcella was innocent.

21:31.663 --> 21:33.037
She was a Lannister.

21:33.038 --> 21:35.662
There are no
innocent Lannisters.

21:35.663 --> 21:38.954
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

21:38.955 --> 21:40.829
Daenerys:
That's enough.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.412
Lord Tyrion
is Hand of the Queen.

21:42.413 --> 21:43.830
You will treat him
with respect.

21:47.788 --> 21:50.830
I am not here to be
queen of the ashes.

21:52.079 --> 21:54.245
That's very nice
to hear.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.203
Of course,
I can't remember a queen

21:56.204 --> 21:59.162
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

21:59.163 --> 22:01.120
The common people
loved her.

22:01.121 --> 22:02.871
The nobles loved her.

22:02.872 --> 22:04.620
And what is left
of her now?

22:04.621 --> 22:07.454
Ashes.

22:07.455 --> 22:09.162
Commoners, nobles,

22:09.163 --> 22:11.037
they're all
just children, really.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.663
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

22:16.663 --> 22:18.912
I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna,
for your counsel.

22:18.913 --> 22:20.829
I'm grateful
to all of you.

22:20.830 --> 22:23.454
But you have chosen
to follow me.

22:23.455 --> 22:25.829
I will not attack
King's Landing.

22:25.830 --> 22:28.662
We will not attack
King's Landing.

22:28.663 --> 22:32.328
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

22:32.329 --> 22:33.663
By asking nicely?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.203
We will lay siege
to the capital,

22:37.204 --> 22:38.912
surrounding the city
on all sides.

22:38.913 --> 22:40.704
Cersei will have
the Iron Throne,

22:40.705 --> 22:43.078
but no food for her army
or the people.

22:43.079 --> 22:45.996
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.037
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

22:48.038 --> 22:49.704
by appealing
to their loyalty,

22:49.705 --> 22:51.370
their love
for their country.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.287
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

22:53.288 --> 22:54.996
we prove her point.

22:54.997 --> 22:56.620
Our army should be
Westerosi.

22:56.621 --> 22:58.912
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

22:58.913 --> 23:00.203
You are.

23:00.204 --> 23:03.580
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

23:06.496 --> 23:09.579
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

23:09.580 --> 23:11.579
back up to King's Landing.

23:11.580 --> 23:14.412
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

23:14.413 --> 23:16.454
alongside
the Tyrell army.

23:16.455 --> 23:19.120
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

23:19.121 --> 23:24.245
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

23:24.246 --> 23:27.621
Forgive me for asking, but why did
you bother to bring your own?

23:29.079 --> 23:32.120
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

23:32.121 --> 23:35.704
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

23:35.705 --> 23:39.871
And the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

23:39.872 --> 23:41.787
Grey Worm
and the Unsullied

23:41.788 --> 23:44.663
will sail for the Rock
and take it.

24:03.204 --> 24:04.830
Do I have
your support?

24:06.621 --> 24:07.997
You have mine.

24:09.788 --> 24:11.663
Dorne is with you,
Your Grace.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.329
Thank you all.

24:19.038 --> 24:20.663
Lady Olenna, may I speak
with you alone?

24:27.872 --> 24:29.620
( door closes )

24:29.621 --> 24:34.037
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

24:34.038 --> 24:37.954
But I swear to you,
she will pay for what she's done.

24:37.955 --> 24:40.620
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

24:40.621 --> 24:42.662
Peace?

24:42.663 --> 24:45.328
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

24:45.329 --> 24:48.454
Or his father?
Or his?

24:48.455 --> 24:51.120
Peace never lasts,
my dear.

24:51.121 --> 24:53.455
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

24:55.496 --> 24:57.454
He's a clever man,
your Hand.

24:57.455 --> 25:01.287
I've known
a great many clever men.

25:01.288 --> 25:03.203
I've outlived them all.

25:03.204 --> 25:05.120
You know why?

25:05.121 --> 25:06.662
I ignored them.

25:06.663 --> 25:10.162
The lords of Westeros
are sheep.

25:10.163 --> 25:11.538
Are you a sheep?

25:13.246 --> 25:14.871
No.

25:14.872 --> 25:17.162
You're a dragon.

25:17.163 --> 25:18.705
Be a dragon.

25:22.288 --> 25:25.037
- ( knocking on door )
- Grey Worm: Mají.

25:25.038 --> 25:26.538
( door opens )

25:29.747 --> 25:31.163
You leave tomorrow.

25:33.997 --> 25:36.412
Were you going
to say goodbye?

25:36.413 --> 25:39.037
I will see you
when I return.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.913
But you don't know
when that will be.

25:42.913 --> 25:43.913
No one knows.

25:46.747 --> 25:48.747
I wish you
good fortune.

25:51.246 --> 25:52.288
Missandei.

26:00.788 --> 26:03.245
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

26:03.246 --> 26:04.454
Why?

26:04.455 --> 26:06.120
You know why.

26:06.121 --> 26:07.204
I don't.

26:10.455 --> 26:13.872
Y-you are my weakness.

26:15.204 --> 26:17.328
That's what I am?

26:17.329 --> 26:18.787
Your weakness?

26:18.788 --> 26:22.496
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

26:23.913 --> 26:26.454
One boy is scared
of dogs,

26:26.455 --> 26:28.328
one boy hates
high places,

26:28.329 --> 26:31.162
one is frightened
of the ocean.

26:31.163 --> 26:33.620
They make the boy
sleep with dogs

26:33.621 --> 26:35.537
or climb a cliff.

26:35.538 --> 26:37.829
They throw him
in the water.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.120
If he learns
to swim, good.

26:40.121 --> 26:42.079
If he drowns, good.

26:43.288 --> 26:46.287
Either way,
strong Unsullied.

26:46.288 --> 26:48.704
But I had no fears.

26:48.705 --> 26:52.496
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

26:54.079 --> 26:57.163
but I was bravest,
always.

26:58.621 --> 27:00.579
- I believe it.
- Until...

27:00.580 --> 27:04.371
I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

27:05.913 --> 27:09.163
Now I have fear.

27:14.788 --> 27:15.997
I do, too.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.038
( sniffles )

28:31.788 --> 28:33.204
No.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.413
I want to see you.

28:37.788 --> 28:39.121
Please.

29:50.538 --> 29:53.371
( panting )

30:11.955 --> 30:13.120
Might be useful.

30:13.121 --> 30:14.996
Ch'Vyalthan was
a dreadful writer,

30:14.997 --> 30:16.829
but an excellent
researcher.

30:16.830 --> 30:19.287
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

30:19.288 --> 30:21.162
Maester Faull was
quite the opposite...

30:21.163 --> 30:23.912
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

30:23.913 --> 30:25.537
Um, I wanted
to ask you...

30:25.538 --> 30:27.328
If you're going
to write histories, Tarly,

30:27.329 --> 30:28.912
you have to do
the research.

30:28.913 --> 30:30.787
If you want people
to read your histories,

30:30.788 --> 30:33.037
you need
a bit of style.

30:33.038 --> 30:35.037
I'm not writing
"A Chronicle of the Wars

30:35.038 --> 30:36.871
Following the Death
of King Robert I"

30:36.872 --> 30:39.163
so it can sit
on a shelf unread.

30:41.496 --> 30:43.997
What?
You don't like the title?

30:45.204 --> 30:46.537
What would you call it, then?

30:46.538 --> 30:49.871
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

30:49.872 --> 30:52.620
We're not poets, Tarly.

30:52.621 --> 30:54.787
Um, Archmaester,
if I could just have a moment.

30:54.788 --> 30:56.537
This is your moment.

30:56.538 --> 30:57.997
Use it wisely.

30:59.913 --> 31:01.997
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

31:03.621 --> 31:05.370
There are
two recorded cases

31:05.371 --> 31:07.203
of advanced greyscale
being cured.

31:07.204 --> 31:09.037
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

31:09.038 --> 31:10.370
by Archmaester Pylos.

31:10.371 --> 31:12.537
I'm familiar with
Archmaester Pylos

31:12.538 --> 31:14.495
and his study
of rare diseases.

31:14.496 --> 31:16.495
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

31:16.496 --> 31:18.413
And shall I tell you
how he died?

31:19.580 --> 31:20.913
From greyscale.

31:22.705 --> 31:24.579
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

31:24.580 --> 31:25.820
which is why
it's now forbidden.

31:44.329 --> 31:46.246
( cart wheels squeaking )

31:59.788 --> 32:01.496
( door opens )

32:10.163 --> 32:11.579
Hello.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.121
- What are you doing?
- ( door closes )

32:15.496 --> 32:17.662
You're Jorah Mormont,

32:17.663 --> 32:19.621
the only son
of Jeor Mormont.

32:20.955 --> 32:22.746
My name
is Samwell Tarly,

32:22.747 --> 32:24.537
Sworn Brother
of the Night's Watch,

32:24.538 --> 32:27.328
training to serve
as maester at Castle Black.

32:27.329 --> 32:28.620
I knew your father.

32:28.621 --> 32:30.121
I was with him
when he died.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.329
You are not dying today,
Ser Jorah.

32:44.329 --> 32:45.954
Drink this.

32:45.955 --> 32:47.746
- What is it?
- Rum.

32:47.747 --> 32:49.907
Drink it all, please.
I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

32:55.872 --> 32:58.329
( coughing )

33:07.913 --> 33:10.328
( clears throat )

33:10.329 --> 33:12.997
If you could
take off your shirt.

33:19.079 --> 33:21.246
( grunts )

33:26.788 --> 33:29.872
If you wouldn't mind,
bite down hard.

33:31.371 --> 33:33.328
I'm sorry, but no one
knows I'm here,

33:33.329 --> 33:35.569
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

33:39.413 --> 33:41.038
Jorah: Have you ever
done this before?

33:48.496 --> 33:49.496
No.

33:51.121 --> 33:53.747
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

33:57.246 --> 33:58.705
Have a seat.

34:02.913 --> 34:05.620
I'm going to have to remove the entire
upper layer of infected tissue,

34:05.621 --> 34:07.913
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

34:20.246 --> 34:23.746
- ( groaning )
- Shh, shh!

34:23.746 --> 34:25.996
Shh.

34:25.996 --> 34:28.411
Again, I'm sorry,

34:28.413 --> 34:30.913
but please try
not to scream.

34:39.621 --> 34:42.786
( grunting )

34:42.788 --> 34:44.455
( shushing )

34:49.663 --> 34:51.455
( whimpering )

35:07.288 --> 35:09.495
( groans )

35:09.496 --> 35:13.079
( muffled shouting )

35:24.705 --> 35:27.163
( chatter, laughter )

35:29.621 --> 35:32.245
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

35:32.246 --> 35:34.996
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

35:34.997 --> 35:36.579
I hope it's true.

35:36.580 --> 35:39.620
If she lays siege to King's Landing,
prices will triple.

35:39.621 --> 35:42.996
As long as we get back
there before they start.

35:42.997 --> 35:45.538
One more round.
It's a long ride.

35:46.663 --> 35:48.996
Hot Pie:
Arry!

35:48.997 --> 35:50.204
Hello, Hot Pie.

35:51.496 --> 35:52.538
Sit down.

35:54.955 --> 35:56.204
Who's that for?

36:04.997 --> 36:06.705
Mm. This is good.

36:08.705 --> 36:10.162
You think so?

36:10.163 --> 36:12.912
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

36:12.913 --> 36:15.871
Most people don't do that 'cause
it takes up too much time.

36:15.872 --> 36:17.495
Mm, I didn't do that.

36:17.496 --> 36:19.037
You've been
making pies?

36:19.038 --> 36:21.370
One or two.

36:21.371 --> 36:23.370
I can't believe
you're here.

36:23.371 --> 36:25.829
Did you meet
the big lady?

36:25.830 --> 36:28.829
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

36:28.830 --> 36:31.037
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

36:31.038 --> 36:34.871
She was looking for your sister,
but I told her about you.

36:34.872 --> 36:36.371
Did she ever find you?

36:37.955 --> 36:39.329
She found me.

36:44.621 --> 36:45.872
What happened
to you, Arry?

36:56.371 --> 36:57.371
You got any ale?

37:01.413 --> 37:02.788
( pouring )

37:12.747 --> 37:14.912
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

37:14.913 --> 37:17.412
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

37:17.413 --> 37:18.996
Heard she blew up
the Great Sept.

37:18.997 --> 37:20.579
That must have been
something to see.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.370
- Boom.
- Mm.

37:22.371 --> 37:24.579
I can't believe
someone would do that.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.121
Cersei would do that.

37:28.288 --> 37:31.328
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

37:31.329 --> 37:33.454
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

37:33.455 --> 37:35.913
No, the Boltons
are dead.

37:37.329 --> 37:39.287
What?

37:39.288 --> 37:41.454
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

37:41.455 --> 37:43.245
and won the Battle
of the Bastards.

37:43.246 --> 37:44.663
He's King
of the North now.

37:46.371 --> 37:47.454
You're lying.

37:47.455 --> 37:49.328
Why would I lie
about that?

37:49.329 --> 37:50.788
He's your brother,
right?

37:57.705 --> 38:00.120
- Thanks for the pie.
- ( coins jingling )

38:00.121 --> 38:02.037
Friends don't pay.

38:02.038 --> 38:04.328
Can't believe
I thought you were a boy.

38:04.329 --> 38:06.246
You're pretty.

38:07.455 --> 38:08.455
Thanks.

38:14.371 --> 38:15.872
Take care
of yourself, Hot Pie.

38:16.997 --> 38:18.662
Try not
to get killed.

38:18.663 --> 38:20.078
Ah, I won't.

38:20.079 --> 38:21.328
I'm like you, Arry.

38:21.329 --> 38:22.997
( sniffs )
I'm a survivor.

38:27.246 --> 38:29.329
200 miles
to King's Landing.

38:30.872 --> 38:32.997
One bottle of rum.
You think we'll make it?

38:34.204 --> 38:35.455
( grunts )

39:05.371 --> 39:07.078
( knocking on door )

39:07.079 --> 39:08.746
Come in.

39:08.747 --> 39:12.204
A raven, my king,
from the Citadel.

39:22.371 --> 39:24.746
Jon: This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

39:24.747 --> 39:28.078
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

39:28.079 --> 39:32.620
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.412
He's discovered proof
that Dragonstone

39:35.413 --> 39:38.245
sits on a mountain
of dragonglass.

39:38.246 --> 39:40.621
( all murmuring )

39:42.413 --> 39:46.579
I received this
a few days ago

39:46.580 --> 39:48.204
from Dragonstone.

39:49.872 --> 39:52.203
It was sent to me
by Tyrion Lannister.

39:52.204 --> 39:54.245
( all murmuring )

39:54.246 --> 39:57.579
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

39:57.580 --> 40:01.620
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

40:01.621 --> 40:03.537
She has a powerful army
at her back

40:03.538 --> 40:07.412
and, if this message
is to be believed,

40:07.413 --> 40:08.704
three dragons.

40:08.705 --> 40:10.704
( all murmuring )

40:10.705 --> 40:13.454
Jon: Lord Tyrion has
invited me to Dragonstone

40:13.455 --> 40:15.204
to meet with Daenerys.

40:16.538 --> 40:17.954
And I'm going
to accept.

40:17.955 --> 40:19.288
- ( all shouting )
- Man: Accept?!

40:21.955 --> 40:25.746
We need this dragonglass,
my lords!

40:25.747 --> 40:27.704
We know that dragonglass
can destroy

40:27.705 --> 40:29.620
both white walkers
and their army.

40:29.621 --> 40:33.163
We need to mine it
and turn it into weapons.

40:34.621 --> 40:36.537
But more importantly,
we need allies!

40:36.538 --> 40:40.829
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

40:40.830 --> 40:42.579
We can't defeat them
on our own.

40:42.580 --> 40:44.412
We don't have
the numbers.

40:44.413 --> 40:48.120
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

40:48.121 --> 40:51.412
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

40:51.413 --> 40:54.537
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

40:54.538 --> 40:56.954
then sail
for Dragonstone.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.871
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

40:59.872 --> 41:02.078
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

41:02.079 --> 41:04.370
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

41:04.371 --> 41:07.495
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

41:07.496 --> 41:09.495
The North is one
of those seven kingdoms.

41:09.496 --> 41:12.328
This isn't an invitation;
it's a trap.

41:12.329 --> 41:15.620
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

41:15.621 --> 41:17.996
You know him.
He's a good man.

41:17.997 --> 41:21.829
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

41:21.830 --> 41:24.912
I remember the Mad King
all too well.

41:24.913 --> 41:27.662
A Targaryen
cannot be trusted.

41:27.663 --> 41:29.871
- Nor can a Lannister.
- All: Yeah!

41:29.872 --> 41:33.328
Aye. We called
your brother king.

41:33.329 --> 41:37.245
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

41:37.246 --> 41:41.037
Winter is here,
Your Grace.

41:41.038 --> 41:43.912
We need the King in the
North in the North.

41:43.913 --> 41:47.246
- Men: Aye!
- ( pounding tables )

41:55.663 --> 41:57.997
You all crowned me
your king.

41:59.872 --> 42:02.203
I never wanted it.

42:02.204 --> 42:04.662
I never asked for it.

42:04.663 --> 42:08.954
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

42:08.955 --> 42:13.245
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

42:13.246 --> 42:14.663
no matter the odds.

42:17.371 --> 42:19.329
But the odds
are against us.

42:22.496 --> 42:25.537
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
None of you.

42:25.538 --> 42:29.579
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.580
We need allies,
powerful allies.

42:35.413 --> 42:37.413
I know it's a risk.

42:39.204 --> 42:40.620
But I have
to take it.

42:40.621 --> 42:43.370
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

42:43.371 --> 42:44.912
Daenerys is a queen.

42:44.913 --> 42:47.245
Only a king can
convince her to help us.

42:47.246 --> 42:49.037
It has to be me.

42:49.038 --> 42:50.996
You're abandoning
your people!

42:50.997 --> 42:52.787
You're abandoning
your home.

42:52.788 --> 42:54.704
I'm leaving both
in good hands.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.121
- Whose?
- Yours.

42:58.163 --> 42:59.620
You are my sister.

42:59.621 --> 43:01.704
You're the only Stark
in Winterfell.

43:01.705 --> 43:05.621
Until I return,
the North is yours.

43:28.830 --> 43:30.747
Littlefinger:
I delivered his bones myself.

43:32.288 --> 43:33.912
Presented them
to Lady Catelyn

43:33.913 --> 43:36.413
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

43:37.747 --> 43:39.246
Seems like
a lifetime ago.

43:40.955 --> 43:43.580
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

43:46.997 --> 43:48.954
I was sorry
when he died.

43:48.955 --> 43:52.663
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

43:55.329 --> 43:56.872
So did I.

43:59.163 --> 44:01.329
She wasn't fond
of you, was she?

44:03.246 --> 44:06.288
Well, it appears she vastly
underestimated you.

44:08.413 --> 44:09.746
Your father
and brothers are gone,

44:09.747 --> 44:11.788
yet here you stand,
King in the North.

44:13.163 --> 44:15.496
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

44:20.621 --> 44:22.663
You don't belong
down here.

44:24.038 --> 44:25.455
Forgive me.

44:27.246 --> 44:30.704
We haven't ever
talked... properly.

44:30.705 --> 44:32.204
I wanted
to remedy that.

44:33.538 --> 44:35.371
I have nothing
to say to you.

44:37.121 --> 44:39.454
Not even
"thank you"?

44:39.455 --> 44:43.704
If it weren't for me, you'd have been
slaughtered on that battlefield.

44:43.705 --> 44:47.079
You have many enemies, my king, but I
swear to you, I'm not one of them.

44:49.663 --> 44:51.746
I love Sansa,

44:51.747 --> 44:53.412
as I loved her mother.

44:53.413 --> 44:54.413
( grunts )

44:57.538 --> 44:59.038
( choking )

45:03.705 --> 45:07.246
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

45:08.455 --> 45:09.913
( gasps )

45:19.413 --> 45:21.705
( chatter )

45:22.913 --> 45:26.246
( horse neighing )

45:33.121 --> 45:34.872
- Man: Ready?
- Man #2: Ready?

45:38.538 --> 45:39.913
Man #2:
Ready!

45:43.413 --> 45:44.538
Come on.

45:48.038 --> 45:50.288
- Man: Yah!
- Man #2: Come on!

46:11.747 --> 46:12.954
( nickering )

46:12.955 --> 46:15.079
( blowing )

46:21.788 --> 46:24.246
( nickering )

46:37.580 --> 46:39.663
( nickering )

46:44.413 --> 46:47.037
( twigs snap )

46:47.038 --> 46:48.997
( rustling )

46:51.246 --> 46:53.496
( footsteps approaching )

46:57.371 --> 46:59.245
( rustling continues )

46:59.246 --> 47:02.329
- ( horse neighing )
- ( wolves snarling )

47:08.455 --> 47:09.997
( horse neighs )

47:11.496 --> 47:15.037
( wolves snarling )

47:15.038 --> 47:16.871
( barks )

47:16.872 --> 47:18.246
( bellows )

47:24.246 --> 47:27.246
( snarling )

47:28.538 --> 47:31.079
( snarling )

47:39.580 --> 47:41.203
Nymeria?

47:41.204 --> 47:43.872
( growling )

47:55.580 --> 47:58.913
Nymeria,
it's me, Arya.

48:00.747 --> 48:01.913
( grunts )

48:03.997 --> 48:06.246
I'm heading north, girl.

48:08.747 --> 48:11.288
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

48:14.830 --> 48:16.079
Come with me.

48:26.288 --> 48:27.705
Come with me.

48:55.830 --> 48:57.455
That's not you.

49:00.621 --> 49:04.079
( men shouting )

49:13.329 --> 49:16.287
Nym: You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

49:16.288 --> 49:17.704
Obara:
I'm oldest.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.829
Mama will want Cersei
for herself.

49:19.830 --> 49:21.829
She's not my mama.

49:21.830 --> 49:23.912
You can have Cersei.

49:23.913 --> 49:26.454
I want the Mountain.

49:26.455 --> 49:28.579
The Mountain
killed Father.

49:28.580 --> 49:30.328
He'll crush you
with one hand.

49:30.329 --> 49:33.078
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

49:33.079 --> 49:35.287
Will you shut up
about Mama?

49:35.288 --> 49:36.871
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

49:36.872 --> 49:40.746
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

49:40.747 --> 49:42.288
And then I won't
have to share.

49:44.788 --> 49:45.997
Both:
"Mama!"

49:48.038 --> 49:49.996
How can you drink
this piss?

49:49.997 --> 49:52.120
When we reach
Sunspear,

49:52.121 --> 49:54.662
I'll treat you
to a Dornish red.

49:54.663 --> 49:57.078
The best
in the world.

49:57.079 --> 49:58.495
Have you ever
been to Dorne?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.495
A few times.

50:00.496 --> 50:01.871
Never stayed long.

50:01.872 --> 50:03.413
A boy in every port?

50:04.538 --> 50:05.997
A boy, a girl.

50:07.538 --> 50:08.913
Depends on the port.

50:12.580 --> 50:14.747
Could we get
some more?

50:16.038 --> 50:17.912
I thought
it wasn't for you.

50:17.913 --> 50:20.204
I'm developing
a taste for it.

50:21.747 --> 50:23.997
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

50:25.955 --> 50:30.704
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

50:30.705 --> 50:32.537
Once I kill my uncle.

50:32.538 --> 50:34.996
And what will you be,
handsome?

50:34.997 --> 50:36.704
Whatever
my queen commands.

50:36.705 --> 50:40.537
He'll be my advisor,
my protector.

50:40.538 --> 50:42.787
Oh, I see.

50:42.788 --> 50:44.204
Your protector.

50:45.955 --> 50:48.495
So, if someone gets
too close to you...

50:48.496 --> 50:50.287
He might have
to intervene.

50:50.288 --> 50:52.078
To hold
that person back.

50:52.079 --> 50:54.747
Until they've made
their intentions known.

50:58.121 --> 51:00.081
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

51:01.580 --> 51:03.662
A foreign invasion
is underway.

51:03.663 --> 51:05.413
Leave him be.

51:08.663 --> 51:10.788
Seems like you
don't need a protector.

51:12.872 --> 51:15.121
- ( crashing )
- ( men shouting )

51:16.580 --> 51:17.705
Stay here.

51:20.705 --> 51:23.663
- ( all shouting )
- Man: We're under attack!

51:45.955 --> 51:47.413

Kill us.

Get it over with.

55:16.788 --> 55:18.788
- ( screams )

Little Theon!

56:15.329 --> 56:18.246
Ah, come on,
you cockless coward.

56:21.913 --> 56:23.996
I have her.

56:23.997 --> 56:25.580
Come and get her.
