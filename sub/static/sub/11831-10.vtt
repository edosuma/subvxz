Preparations continue here
for tonight's execution...

12:27.605 --> 12:29.938
of convicted murderer
Randall Jefferson.

12:30.005 --> 12:34.505
Just minutes ago, the state
supreme court dismissed
his last series of appeals.

12:34.572 --> 12:38.205
That means his lawyers
will now have to race off
to federal court.

12:38.272 --> 12:40.738
But for now,
preparations continue--

12:40.805 --> 12:44.472
Here we go. District court
names are at top,
court of appeals at bottom.

12:44.538 --> 12:47.072
I've starred
the Reagan appointees.
I should've crossed them off.

12:47.138 --> 12:49.105
Fax numbers, home phones,
reversal rates.

12:49.172 --> 12:52.038
You're sure we can get around
the new habeas restrictions?
It's not really habeas.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.205
We're asking for a hearing based
on evidence not available
to the trial court.

12:55.272 --> 12:57.172
It would be nice
if we <i>had</i> some new evidence.

Where are we on

12:59.272 --> 13:01.538
Affidavits from two clerks
sayin' his first lawyer...

13:01.605 --> 13:03.672
basically sat passive
through most of the trial.

13:03.738 --> 13:05.838
A fact which seemed
to bother no one.

13:05.905 --> 13:08.305
I just got off the phone with
Franklin Walters, the judge
from the original trial.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.172
He's willing to say that
if he would have known about
the abuse in Randy's past,

13:11.238 --> 13:13.238
he would have used
his discretion...

13:13.305 --> 13:15.238
to convert the death sentence
into life without parole.

13:15.305 --> 13:17.305
He's faxing it over right now.
Well, that's something.

13:17.372 --> 13:19.438
What about that
jury pool business?
<i>It won't fly.</i>

13:19.505 --> 13:23.405
Under <i>McCleskey,</i> we'd still have
to show specific discrimination
in this case.

13:23.472 --> 13:26.905
What about that jailhouse
witness, Dugger, the one
who claimed Randy confessed?

13:26.972 --> 13:28.872

Yeah, yeah.
No, there is something.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.038
<i>I was going through</i>
<i>these press files again,</i>

13:31.105 --> 13:34.438
and Frank Dugger gave
a few interviews around the time
of the first state appeal.

13:34.505 --> 13:38.838
And there is one here,
and he said something
really strange.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.938
Yeah.
"There's no question.
I heard what I heard.

13:41.005 --> 13:44.405
The man told me he killed
that girl. I took that test,
so you know I'm not lying."

13:44.472 --> 13:46.772
Test?
Like in a polygraph test?

13:46.838 --> 13:49.338
Who gave him a lie detector?
And why isn't it
in the record?

13:49.405 --> 13:51.272

Okay, that gives us six hours.

first of all.

13:56.405 --> 13:59.138
Was there a polygraph,
what was the result, and what
the hell happened to it?

to leak this thing, maybe

I's ready.

15:36.772 --> 15:39.038
[ Interviewer ]
What's the difference between
a polygraph and a lie detector?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.938
A polygraph
<i>is</i> a lie detector.

15:41.005 --> 15:44.505
Okay, so this
unreported polygraph test,
why is it so important?

15:44.572 --> 15:46.472
I thought
they were inadmissible.
They are.

15:46.538 --> 15:51.238
But if the prosecution took a
polygraph and the result in any
way suggested Randy's innocence,

15:51.305 --> 15:53.605
the law is they got to turn
that over to the defense.

15:53.672 --> 15:55.672
If they didn't,
it's prosecutorial misconduct.

15:55.738 --> 15:57.938
If they did and
the defense ignored it,

15:58.005 --> 16:00.505
well, then that's
ineffective assistance
of counsel.

16:00.572 --> 16:02.605
And that's enough
for a stay of execution?

16:02.672 --> 16:06.538
Ten years ago, with Brennan
and Blackmun and Marshall,
even money.

16:06.605 --> 16:08.572
Today--

16:08.638 --> 16:10.872
Eugene, what's your impression
of Randy Jefferson?

16:10.938 --> 16:13.472
I don't really know him.
But that's not the point.

16:13.538 --> 16:15.572
Who or what he is
is beside the point?

16:15.638 --> 16:18.872
What he is is black,
among other things.
There's a point to that.

16:18.938 --> 16:22.372
So this is a question
of race with you?
The death penalty is about race.

16:22.438 --> 16:26.105
The fact is if you're
a person of color and you kill
a white man in this country,

16:26.172 --> 16:29.472
or, God forbid, you do what
they say Randy Jefferson did
and kill a white girl,

16:29.538 --> 16:32.005
you are 12 times more likely
to end up on death row...

16:32.072 --> 16:33.872
than a white man for killin'
a black person.

16:33.938 --> 16:37.872
But that's not something
you can actually argue in court.
Nope.

16:37.938 --> 16:41.538
Can't argue that much
in court.

You know, I asked
some buddies of mine up north
what they knew about you.

38:35.686 --> 38:38.353
Did you?
They felt it was a bit
hypocritical for you...

Shortly after midnight

was initiated.

By 12:03, the condemned
was fully unconscious...

just a few minutes ago...

42:02.435 --> 42:05.301

42:06.835 --> 42:09.601
His final words were...

42:09.668 --> 42:13.268
that he was innocent
of the crime for which
he had been convicted,

42:13.335 --> 42:16.768
that he asked pardon
of any people he had hurt,

42:16.835 --> 42:20.668
