IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.875 --> 00:12.146
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.448
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.350 --> 00:17.651
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.685 --> 00:20.054
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.290
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.393
- UGH, REALLY?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.295
YOU DRAGGED ME OUT
TO A MIDNIGHT MOVIE?

00:27.328 --> 00:29.130
- IT'S THE ORIGINAL
DAWN OF THE DEAD.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.798
- WE CAN NETFLIX IT
AT HOME.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.633
- COME ON,
YOU'LL HAVE FUN.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.236
BESIDES, DID I MENTION
THE THEATER SERVES BOOZE?

00:35.269 --> 00:38.072
- DID I MENTION HOW MUCH
I LOVE MIDNIGHT MOVIES?

00:38.106 --> 00:39.607
[car alarm blares]

00:39.640 --> 00:42.076
- HEY! GET AWAY
FROM MY CAR!

00:44.812 --> 00:47.315

00:56.190 --> 00:58.626
- [groans]
- [screams]

00:58.659 --> 01:00.694
- A BYSTANDER
YANKED THE KNIFE OUT?

01:00.728 --> 01:02.130
- AND UNCORKED THE ARTERY.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.063
WHEN IT STARTED SPURTING,

01:03.097 --> 01:05.166
THE GIRLFRIEND TRIED
STICKING IT BACK IN.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.468
- EVERYONE GRABBING THIS THING,
PERP'S PRINTS ARE LONG GONE.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.103
- CROTCH THE ONLY
STAB WOUND?

01:09.137 --> 01:10.003
- ANOTHER TO THE ABDOMEN

01:10.037 --> 01:11.872
AND A DEFENSIVE CUT
ON HIS RIGHT HAND.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.108
VICTIM'S LUCKY
HIS B.A.C. WAS .19.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.110
BEING DRUNK PROBABLY
BLUNTED THE PAIN.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.378
- NO WONDER
HE COULDN'T FIND HIS CAR.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.846
- BIGGEST PROBLEM IS,
HE BANGED HIS HEAD

01:18.879 --> 01:20.348
AND HIS BRAIN
STARTED BLEEDING.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.150
AND WE OPERATED
AND STABILIZED HIM,

01:22.183 --> 01:23.684
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE'S STILL COMATOSE.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.186
- GOT A NAME?
- JOHN DOE.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.155
NO WALLET,
NO I.D., NO PHONE.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.489
ONLY THINGS ON HIM
WERE CAR KEYS

01:28.522 --> 01:30.324
AND A BLOODY PARKING STUB
IN HIS POCKET.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.792
- WELL,
WE'LL FINGERPRINT HIM,

01:31.825 --> 01:34.562
GET A DNA SWAB,
MAYBE I.D. HIM THAT WAY.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.230
- GOOD LUCK.
- THANKS.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.165
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:37.198 --> 01:41.235
SEX CRIME, REVENGE ATTACK,
BOTCHED ROBBERY?

01:41.269 --> 01:43.371
- HOW ABOUT
ALL OF THE ABOVE?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.778
[Law & Order theme]

01:50.811 --> 01:58.752
*

02:35.723 --> 02:38.192
- GUY SEEMED NORMAL WHEN HE
PULLED IN AND TOOK HIS TICKET.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.560
HE EVEN SMILED AT ME
AS HE HEADED OUT.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.861
- FAST FORWARD
TO WHEN HE CAME BACK.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.396
[typing on keyboard]

02:44.265 --> 02:45.566
- BY THEN HE WAS EFFED UP.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.735
DRUNK.
BANGED ON MY WINDOW,

02:47.768 --> 02:48.936
WANTED HELP
FINDING HIS CAR.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.771
- YOU HELP HIM OUT?
- MM-MMM.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.673
BOSS DOESN'T LIKE ME
LEAVING THE BOOTH.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.575
- YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER
WITH A KNIFE

02:54.608 --> 02:55.776
STICKING OUT
OF HIS CROTCH.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.811
- THE COUNTER'S IN THE WAY.
I NEVER SAW IT.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.513
- RIGHT.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.682
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.684
- UH-HUH.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.686
[tires squealing]

03:05.719 --> 03:07.655
- GET ANYTHING?
- COUPLE OF BLOODY SHOE PRINTS.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.490
I SENT PATROL
TO TRACK 'EM BACK

03:09.523 --> 03:10.991
TO WHERE OUR VICTIM
WAS CUT UP.

03:11.024 --> 03:15.729
- LIV, ELLIOTT,
LEVEL TWO, EAST STAIRWELL.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.931
- JOHN DOE'S CAR.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.333
- WENT AROUND
CLICKING HIS REMOTE.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.468
DOORS ON THIS ONE POPPED.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.670
- SAME MAKE AND MODEL AS
THE ONE HE TRIED BREAKING INTO.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.405
- YEAH, WELL,
GETTING KNIFED IN THE NADS

03:24.438 --> 03:25.906
HAS A WAY
OF CONFUSING YOU.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.278
- WELL, OUR JOHN DOE'S
REAL NAME IS JERRY BULLARD.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.280
LIVES ON WEST 74TH.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.714
- YEAH?

03:33.747 --> 03:36.417
AND HE WORKS
AT A PLACE CALLED B.A.S.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.853
- THAT STANDS FOR
"BULLARD AVIATION SYSTEMS."

03:41.355 --> 03:44.558
- "AFGHANISTAN DEPLOYMENT:
JUNE 2011."

03:44.592 --> 03:46.727
- THE GUY KILLS PEOPLE
FOR A LIVING.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.698
- KILL PEOPLE?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.900
NO, JERRY DESIGNS TIRES
ON THESE THINGS,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.436
LANDING GEAR, STRUTS.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.571
BORING STUFF HE LEARNED
IN THE AIR FORCE.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.972
- SO, YOU DON'T THINK
THE ATTACK ON YOUR HUSBAND

03:59.006 --> 04:00.474
WAS WORK-RELATED?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.310
- HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
A SECURITY CLEARANCE.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.778
- MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:04.812 --> 04:06.614
- JANETTE,
YOUR DAD'S BEEN HURT.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.715
- WHAT?

04:07.748 --> 04:08.716
- NOW, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.751
HE'S ALREADY
AT THE HOSPITAL.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.353
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.288
HOW DID HE GET BACK
FROM D.C. SO QUICKLY?

04:14.322 --> 04:15.789
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
HE NEVER WENT.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.725
WE FOUND HIS SUITCASE
AND HIS BOARDING PASS

04:17.758 --> 04:18.726
IN HIS CAR.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.961
- BUT HE HAD MEETINGS
AT THE PENTAGON TODAY.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.731
WE HAD DINNER WITH HIM
BEFORE HE LEFT FOR LA GUARDIA.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.399
- HE KISSED US BOTH GOOD-BYE.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.734
- MRS. BULLARD,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

04:26.767 --> 04:29.670
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.539
- WE DON'T HAVE SECRETS
IN THIS FAMILY.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.074
- OKAY.

04:34.107 --> 04:38.812
UM, DID YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
HAVE ANY MARITAL PROBLEMS?

04:38.846 --> 04:39.847
- WHY?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.815
- WELL, THE ASSAULT
HAD SEXUAL OVERTONES TO IT

04:41.849 --> 04:45.419
AND MAY BE THE ACTIONS
OF A SPURNED LOVER.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.688
- JERRY BULLARD
WAS NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.890
HE'S AS VANILLA
AS THEY COME,

04:49.923 --> 04:51.759
AND OUR SEX LIFE
IS GREAT.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.026
- MOM, EW.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.728
- HOW ABOUT YOU,
JANETTE?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.730
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING OFF
ABOUT YOUR FATHER LATELY?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.600
WAS HE DIFFICULT
TO GET ON THE PHONE OR...

04:59.633 --> 05:00.868
- DAD'S BEEN TOTALLY NORMAL.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.336
AND HE IS A PRUDE.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.971
HE DIDN'T LET ME START DATING
TILL I WAS 15.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.840
- [laughs]

05:06.874 --> 05:08.976
- CAN WE GO SEE HIM NOW?
- OF COURSE, SWEETHEART.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.645
GO GRAB MY BAG.
GO ON.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.648
PLEASE. FIND THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.351
JERRY IS OUR WHOLE LIFE.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.652
- AND BULLARD
AVIATION SOLUTIONS

05:18.686 --> 05:20.488
CAN HELP YOU GO
WHEELS UP

05:20.521 --> 05:23.491
IN ACHIEVING
YOUR FLIGHT SYSTEM SUCCESS.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.825
AS PRESIDENT OF B.A.S...

05:24.858 --> 05:26.427
- OUR VICTIM AS CLEAN
AS HE LOOKS?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.895
- SQUEAKY.
- I GUARANTEE IT.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.863
- NICE FAMILY,
NO WORK TROUBLES.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.699
HE WAS SCHEDULED TO FLY OUT
OF LA GUARDIA LAST NIGHT,

05:31.732 --> 05:34.568
BUT NO BRIDGE, TUNNEL, OR TOLL
SHOWS HIM LEAVING MANHATTAN.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.436
- WELL, WHEREVER HE WENT,

05:35.469 --> 05:36.937
IT MUST'VE BEEN
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE

05:36.970 --> 05:38.472
OF THAT GARAGE.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.108
YOU FIND
THE ACTUAL CRIME SCENE?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.443
- WELL, PATROL
TRIED BACKTRACKING

05:42.476 --> 05:43.411
THE BLOODY FOOTPRINTS,

05:43.444 --> 05:45.846
BUT THEY CRISSCROSSED
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.681
IT WAS LIKE
BULLARD WANDERED AIMLESSLY

05:47.715 --> 05:48.716
AFTER HE WAS ATTACKED.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.117
- ANY IDEA
WHERE HE GOT DRUNK?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.452
- WELL, THE WIFE SAID
HE LEFT THE HOUSE

05:51.485 --> 05:52.420
SOBER AS A JUDGE,

05:52.453 --> 05:54.622
AND WE COULDN'T FIND
A SINGLE BAR IN THE AREA

05:54.655 --> 05:55.923
THAT SAID
THAT THEY SERVED HIM.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.691
- SO, WE GOT NO CRIME SCENE,

05:57.725 --> 05:59.159
AND OUR VICTIM
IS STILL IN A COMA.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.394
WE GOT NOTHING.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.595
- EXCEPT A SUSPECT.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.764
BUNCH OF PEOPLE
SAW THE NEIGHBORHOOD WEIRDO

06:03.797 --> 06:05.699
WEARING BLOODY CLOTHES
THAT NIGHT.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.635
- "NEIGHBORHOOD WEIRDO"?

06:07.668 --> 06:08.736
- HIS NAME'S ALDO.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.738
WORD IS HE STARTED OFF
A NORMAL GUY.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.774
ITALIAN IMMIGRANT, WIFE,
JOB AT THE BUTCHER SHOP.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.142
- WELL,
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.545
- A YEAR AGO, HE CUT OFF
A COUPLE OF HIS FINGERTIPS

06:17.578 --> 06:18.812
ON THE SLICER.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.448
THEN HE GETS FIRED,
HIS WIFE SPLITS,

06:20.481 --> 06:22.450
AND HE STARTS WALKING
THE STREETS, ACTING ODD,

06:22.483 --> 06:23.484
SCARING PEOPLE.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.819
AROUND THERE, THEY CALL HIM
THE NIGHT STALKER.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.625
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS GUY'S OUT HERE?

06:31.659 --> 06:32.960
ALL I'VE SEEN
IN THE LAST HALF HOUR

06:32.993 --> 06:34.462
IS A FIVE-POUND RAT.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.529
- YEAH, YOU GOT IT BAD?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.765
I JUST SAW A TRANSVESTITE
WHO LOOKS LIKE MUNCH.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.066
- [laughs]
MY APOLOGIES.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.203
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
WE MAY HAVE MOVEMENT.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.573
- IS IT
THE NIGHT STALKER?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.174
- FITS THE DESCRIPTION.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.510
AND I'LL BE DAMNED
IF HE STILL ISN'T WEARING

06:49.543 --> 06:50.611
THE BLOODY SHIRT.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.879
HE'S COMING RIGHT TO YOU.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.981
- I'LL ENGAGE,
YOU FLANK.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.621
EXCUSE ME. SIR?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.723
POLICE. CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.692
- HOW YOU DOING, ALDO?

07:04.725 --> 07:07.160
- LEAVE ME ALONE!
I--I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

07:07.194 --> 07:09.663
- ALDO, WHY DO YOU HAVE BLOOD
ALL OVER YOUR SHIRT?

07:09.697 --> 07:12.666
- AND WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO SQUIRRELY?

07:12.700 --> 07:14.001
LET'S GO.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.904
- LET GO OF ME!
I'M NOT HURTING ANYONE!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.639
I JUST WANNA GO TO SLEEP!

07:18.672 --> 07:20.240
WHY WON'T ANYONE
LET ME SLEEP?!

07:20.273 --> 07:23.110
[pounds table]

07:23.143 --> 07:25.946
- WHY WON'T ANYONE
LET ME SLEEP?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.649
- ALDO, I'M DR. HUANG.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.150
I'M A PSYCHIATRIST.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.788
- I JUST WANT TO SLEEP.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.224
- THE DETECTIVES ASKED ME
TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT A RUN-IN

07:37.257 --> 07:39.493
THAT YOU MIGHT'VE HAD
WITH THIS MAN.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.232
DO YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

07:47.635 --> 07:49.737
- WHAT DAY IS THIS?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.038
- WEDNESDAY.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.940
BUT WE THINK YOU
MIGHT'VE SEEN HIM ON MONDAY

07:52.973 --> 07:56.109
BETWEEN 8:30 AND MIDNIGHT.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.145
- WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

07:58.178 --> 07:59.547
- I'M DR. HUANG.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.217
SO, DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS MAN?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.590
- I THINK SO.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.759
WAS IT LAST YEAR?

08:11.792 --> 08:14.695
- ALDO, DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE
KEEPING TRACK OF TIME?

08:14.728 --> 08:15.729
- YES.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.231
BUT NOT BECAUSE I'M CRAZY.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.900
IT'S BECAUSE I NEVER SLEEP.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.902
- YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
INSOMNIA LATELY?

08:21.935 --> 08:25.005
- FOR A YEAR.
- YOU MUST DOZE OFF AT TIMES.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.608
EVEN WITH INSOMNIA,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID HAVING

08:27.641 --> 08:28.742
WHAT ARE CALLED MICRO-SLEEPS.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.612
- NO, NO, NO,
I NEVER SLEEP!

08:31.645 --> 08:33.781
NOT ONE NIGHT,
NOT ONE SECOND!

08:33.814 --> 08:37.785
I TAKE SLEEPING PILLS,
BUT NOTHING HELPS.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.588
MY BRAIN,
IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.090
I CAN'T GET MYSELF
TO THINK RIGHT.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.793
- LOSING FOCUS
CAUSED YOUR ACCIDENT AT WORK.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.231
- SLICER CUT OFF
TWO OF MY FINGERS.

08:51.264 --> 08:55.669
AFTER THAT, MY WIFE,
SHE NOT COULD TAKE IT ANYMORE.

08:55.703 --> 08:59.673
AND THEN THE LADY DOWNSTAIRS,
SHE CALLED THE COPS,

08:59.707 --> 09:03.110
'CAUSE I, UH, I KEPT HER UP,
PACING ALL THE TIME.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.813
- SO, NOW YOU WALK
THE STREETS AT NIGHT.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.883
AND THIS ALL STARTED
A YEAR AGO?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.184
- YES.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.587
THE SWEATING TOO.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.322
I CAN'T STAY DRY.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.925
EVEN IN WINTER.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.064
- ALDO, CAN I LOOK
IN YOUR EYES A MOMENT?

09:32.973 --> 09:36.209
- WHAT IS IT, DOCTOR?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.078
CAN YOU SEE
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.747
- I MEAN,
HE'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.749
- ONLY FROM
AN UNDERLYING DISORDER.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.117
HIS INSOMNIA, SWEATING,
AND EXTREME MYOSIS

09:44.151 --> 09:45.653
ARE ALL SYMPTOMS

09:45.686 --> 09:47.655
OF A KIND OF GENETIC,
NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE

09:47.688 --> 09:49.890
CALLED
FATAL FAMILIAL INSOMNIA.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.724
- NEVER HEARD OF IT.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.259
- IT'S ONLY RECENTLY
BEEN DESCRIBED

09:52.292 --> 09:53.260
IN THE LITERATURE.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.862
IT MAINLY AFFECTS FAMILIES

09:54.895 --> 09:56.730
FROM A SMALL TOWN
IN ITALY, LIKE HIS.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.932
- AND BY "FATAL,"
YOU MEAN FATAL.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.668
- MOST PATIENTS DIE
OF EXHAUSTION

10:00.701 --> 10:02.202
WITHIN 15 MONTHS
OF THE FIRST SYMPTOMS.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.871
- AND HE'S ALREADY
HAD IT FOR 12.

10:03.904 --> 10:04.738
- WELL, HE COULD STILL BE
OUR KILLER.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.807
I MEAN, CSU RAN
A SWATCH OF HIS SHIRT,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.842
AND THAT'S
OUR VICTIM'S BLOOD ON IT.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.147
- I DID SEE THIS MAN
MONDAY NIGHT,

10:14.181 --> 10:17.284
AND I THINK
I REMEMBER WHERE.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.120
THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENED.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.354
- IT'S WHERE WHAT HAPPENED?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.023
- WHATEVER MAKE HIM BLOODY.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.258
THAT'S HOW IT GOT
ON MY CLOTHES.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.827
HE RUN--RUN INTO ME.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.995
- OUT HERE IN THE ALLEY?

10:28.028 --> 10:31.699
- NO, I--I WAS--
I WAS OVER THERE.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.001
I WAS OUT WALKING

10:34.034 --> 10:35.869
WHEN I HEARD A COMMOTION
IN THE ALLEY.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.205
- WHAT COMMOTION?
LIKE, UH, PEOPLE YELLING?

10:38.238 --> 10:40.373
- LIKE, UH,
SOMEONE BEING MURDERED.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.743
I GOT SCARED.
I SLOWED DOWN.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.845
THAT'S WHEN I SEE
THE GUY COME AROUND THE CORNER,

10:44.878 --> 10:47.715
COVERED IN BLOOD,
AND HE RUN RIGHT INTO ME.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.183
- YOU SEE HIS ATTACKER?
- [laughs]

10:50.217 --> 10:51.919
I'M TOO BUSY
BEING KNOCKED DOWN.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.688
- AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOU SAW THE BLOODY MAN.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.157
- YEAH. HE DRESSED VERY NICE
LIKE THE OTHERS.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.826
- LIKE WHAT OTHERS?

10:58.859 --> 11:01.061
- LIKE THE ONES, UH,

11:01.094 --> 11:03.430
FROM OVER THERE.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.098
- WHAT IS THAT PLACE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.166
BUT A LOT OF TIMES
I WALK AROUND,

11:06.199 --> 11:08.101
AND I SEE PEOPLE
COME IN AND OUT.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.103
LIKE MONDAY NIGHT.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.340
SO, UH,
I CAN GO NOW, RIGHT?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.342
YOU--YOU SEE
I--I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.144
- YOU'VE BEEN
VERY HELPFUL, ALDO,

11:17.177 --> 11:20.848
BUT I'D LIKE TO ADMIT YOU
TO A HOSPITAL, RUN SOME TESTS,

11:20.881 --> 11:22.349
TRY TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONDITION BETTER.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.385
- THEN YOU'LL CURE ME?

11:31.925 --> 11:34.427
- I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN FOR YOU.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.398
COME ON.

11:38.431 --> 11:42.069
- WELL, WE MIGHT'VE LOST
OUR MURDER SUSPECT...

11:42.102 --> 11:44.371
BUT I'M THINKING OUR NEXT CLUE
IS BEHIND THIS DOOR.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.339
- PLACE IS CALLED
"THE SWING SET.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.841
NEW YORK DOT COM."

11:47.875 --> 11:50.010
- IS THAT A SWINGER CLUB?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.845
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A SINGLE POLYESTER PANTSUIT.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.213
- WELL,
THE SWING SET'S MOTTO

11:53.246 --> 11:55.148
IS "NOT YOUR PARENTS'
PLAYGROUND."

11:55.182 --> 11:57.517
"A NEW KIND OF
EROTIC ESTABLISHMENT."

11:57.550 --> 12:00.520
- THEMED PLAY ROOMS,
S&M SHOWS,

12:00.553 --> 12:04.324
SEXUALITY WORKSHOPS, FULL BAR,
AND A NIGHTLY BUFFET.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.326
- REMIND ME TO STEER CLEAR
OF THE FINGER FOODS.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.395
- IT ALSO SAYS,
"THE SWING SET IS OPEN

12:08.428 --> 12:09.529
"TO SINGLES, COUPLES,
AND THREESOMES,

12:09.562 --> 12:13.266
BUT NEW MEMBERS MUST BE INVITED
BY A CURRENT MEMBER."

12:14.334 --> 12:16.904
- HOW DO YOU WANNA PLAY IT?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.206
- TELL 'EM OUR GOOD FRIEND
JERRY INVITED US.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.414
[indistinct chatter]

12:31.885 --> 12:35.188
- WELCOME TO THE SWING SET.
I'M SUZETTE.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.057
- HI, SUZETTE.
UH, THIS IS MY WIFE OLIVIA.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.325
I'M ELLIOT.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.793
- AND YOU WERE INVITED BY...

12:39.827 --> 12:41.094
- FRIEND OF MY HUSBAND,
JERRY BULLARD.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.264
- JERRY! ONE OF
OUR BEST MEMBERS.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.934
FIRST TIME EXPERIENCING
THE LIFESTYLE?

12:46.967 --> 12:49.069
- [chuckles]
- IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.303
- YOU TWO ARE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF FUN.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.872
COME ON.

12:59.847 --> 13:00.914
- CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.182
- UH, TWO CLUB SODAS.
- YEAH.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.819
- SPIDER, TWO CLUB SODAS
FOR OUR NEW FRIENDS.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.120
- COMING RIGHT UP.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.989
- SO, UM...

13:09.022 --> 13:10.123
SINCE THIS
IS OUR FIRST TIME,

13:10.157 --> 13:13.126
IS IT OKAY IF WE JUST,
YOU KNOW...

13:13.160 --> 13:15.162
- JUST WATCH?
- YES.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.966
- ABSOLUTELY. DON'T FEEL
ANY PRESSURE TO DO ANYTHING.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.934
YOU CAN WALK AROUND
AND MINGLE,

13:20.968 --> 13:24.504
OR JUST SIT BACK, RELAX,
AND DRINK IT ALL IN,

13:24.537 --> 13:27.140
ALTHOUGH WHAT YOU SEE
WILL BE VERY TEMPTING.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.277
- ENJOY, FOLKS.
- THANK YOU.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.981
- TO QUENCHING
YOUR EVERY THIRST.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.849
- [chuckles]

13:35.883 --> 13:36.950
[glasses clink]

13:36.984 --> 13:38.385
- UH, SO,
UH, JERRY SAID

13:38.418 --> 13:40.020
THAT HE WAS GONNA
BE HERE TONIGHT.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.154
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

13:41.188 --> 13:42.489
- NOT YET.
BUT YOU WANNA FIND JERRY,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.124
JUST LOOK FOR CASSANDRA.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.393
- WHO'S CASSANDRA?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.161
- I'M SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T MENTION HER.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.397
HE PROBABLY WANTS
TO KEEP HER ALL TO HIMSELF.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.866
- [chuckles]
- OH, THERE SHE IS NOW.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.036
- WOW, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.039
- SEE WHAT I MEAN
ABOUT TEMPTATION?

14:04.077 --> 14:07.948
[whispering]

14:15.422 --> 14:17.657
- ELLIOT, OLIVIA.
- HI.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.625
- GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.660
- NOT HALF AS GLAD AS WE ARE.
- [chuckles]

14:20.693 --> 14:22.462
- DO YOU MIND IF YOUR HUSBAND
BUYS ME A DRINK?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.131
- WELL, IF HE DOESN'T,
I WILL.

14:24.164 --> 14:24.998
- WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.566
- SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS,
SPLASH OF WATER.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.634
- COMING RIGHT UP.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.303
- SO, UH, SUZETTE SAYS
YOU KNOW OUR FRIEND JERRY.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.039
- YEAH.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.909
JERRY AND I PLAYED TOGETHER
JUST THE OTHER NIGHT.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.045
I--I HOPE HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU
ALL THE DETAILS

14:38.078 --> 14:39.146
AND SPOIL THE FUN.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.181
- JERRY DIDN'T SAY A WORD,

14:41.214 --> 14:44.251
EXCEPT THAT WE SHOULD
COME HERE AND PLAY TOO.

14:44.284 --> 14:48.288
- UH...

14:48.321 --> 14:49.589
- HI.
- HI.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.391
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
HERE BEFORE.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.226
- NO. I'M OLIVIA.
I'M A NEWBIE.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.130
- OH. WE LOVE NEWBIES.
- [laugh]

14:57.164 --> 14:58.966
- ELLIOT.
- MM-HMM?

14:58.999 --> 15:02.469
- COME HERE.
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.575
- RELAX, OLIVIA.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.077
YOU'RE SAFE WITH US.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.111
- PROBABLY.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.147
all: [laugh]

15:20.087 --> 15:22.355
- A LITTLE CROWDED
IN HERE.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.357
- I LIKE THE ENERGY
A LITTLE BETTER.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.625
- HMM.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.261
- SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.263
- I'M INTO AVIATION DESIGN
LIKE JERRY.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.432
- [laugh]

15:32.465 --> 15:35.135
I DON'T MEAN
FOR A LIVING.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.238
OLIVIA'S LOVELY.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.539
- YEAH...

15:39.572 --> 15:42.109
- I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
YOU'RE WILLING TO, UH,

15:42.142 --> 15:44.144
SHARE HER
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.380
- WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO BROADEN OUR HORIZONS.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.717
[sighs]
WHAT'S JERRY INTO?

15:53.220 --> 15:55.688
- EVERYTHING.
- HMM.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.190
- WE HAD A LOT OF FUN
MONDAY NIGHT.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.026
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.560
POOR THING.
HE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.729
HE WENT OUTSIDE FOR SOME AIR,
AND I LOST TRACK OF HIM.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.564
- OH.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.599
DID YOU SEE
WHO HE LEFT WITH?

16:09.236 --> 16:11.204
- YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT JERRY.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.007
ARE YOU--I MEAN,
IT'S TOTALLY COOL

16:14.041 --> 16:15.008
IF YOU TWO ARE...

16:15.042 --> 16:16.076
both: [laugh]

16:16.109 --> 16:17.744
- NO, JERRY'S MY PAL.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.212
both: [chuckle]

16:19.246 --> 16:20.713
- GOOD.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.049
YOU'RE INTO WOMEN.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.117
- MM.
- MM.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.520
HOW INTO WOMEN ARE YOU?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.057
- WELL, ELLIOT AND I HAVE BEEN
INTO EACH OTHER FOR SO LONG

16:30.090 --> 16:32.192
THAT, UH,
WE DECIDED TO...

16:32.225 --> 16:33.726
SPREAD OUR WINGS
A LITTLE.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.395
- YOU FLEW
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.696
- WHO EXTENDED
THE INVITATION?

16:36.729 --> 16:39.099
- UH, JERRY BULLARD.
YOU KNOW HIM, RIGHT?

16:39.132 --> 16:40.800
- WE'VE MET JERRY
A COUPLE TIMES.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.136
HARD TO GET
HIS ATTENTION, THOUGH.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.039
- HE ONLY HAS EYES
FOR CASSANDRA.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.374
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.475
- CAN YOU BLAME THEM?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.476
both: [laugh]

16:49.509 --> 16:52.345
- SEE? EVEN HER.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.614
- YOU KNOW,
SINCE I'M NEW HERE,

16:54.647 --> 16:58.051
I--I WAS SORT OF WONDERING,
HOW DO, UH,

16:58.085 --> 16:59.686
HOW DO YOU TWO
DEAL WITH THE JEALOUSY?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.688
- I NEVER GET JEALOUS.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.423
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE FUN
IF YOU'RE NOT OPEN

17:03.456 --> 17:05.092
TO EVERYONE
AND EVERYTHING?

17:05.125 --> 17:08.628
- MM, I TELL THAT TO OLIVIA
ALL THE TIME.

17:08.661 --> 17:12.299
- WELL, I WISH MORE MEN
WERE LIKE YOU.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.034
SOME CAN GET,
UH, POSSESSIVE.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.107
- IS THAT HOW
YOU GOT THIS SCAR?

17:22.109 --> 17:24.144
- YOU'RE VERY OBSERVANT.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.213
- I LIKE THE VIEW.

17:26.246 --> 17:30.150
- THIS IS COURTESY
OF MY EX-BOYFRIEND DOUG.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.151
- DOUG?

17:31.184 --> 17:32.819
- [sighs deeply]
YEAH.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.188
YOU KNOW, SOME MEN JUST
CAN'T HANDLE THE LIFESTYLE.

17:35.222 --> 17:39.359
- MM-HMM.
- HE...JUST COULDN'T.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.229
IT TAKES A MAN
WITH REAL CONFIDENCE, YOU KNOW?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.465
- IS MY HUSBAND SAFE
WITH CASSANDRA?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.533
- [chuckles]

17:46.566 --> 17:49.736
ONLY DANGER HERE IS HAVING
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD TIME.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.105
- UNLESS DOUG COMES IN AGAIN.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.174
- WHO'S DOUG?
- CASSANDRA'S EX-BOYFRIEND.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.842
UH, HE WON'T LEAVE HER ALONE.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.610
- OR THE GUY
SHE HOOKS UP WITH.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.381
DOUG MADE A BIG SCENE
IN HERE A WEEK AGO.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.184
WE WERE ALL
IN THE PLAY ROOM...

18:04.217 --> 18:05.618
- JERRY AND I
WERE HAVING FUN

18:05.652 --> 18:07.620
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
WE HEARD THIS, UH,

18:07.654 --> 18:08.855
YELLING OUT AT THE BAR.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.757
- DOUG STORMED IN
THE FRONT DOOR.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.592
I HEARD SUZETTE TELL SPIDER
TO THROW HIM OUT,

18:12.625 --> 18:13.460
BUT BEFORE HE COULD,

18:13.493 --> 18:16.163
DOUG CAME BARGING
INTO THE PLAY ROOM.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.165
- SCREAMING ABOUT
HOW I BELONG TO HIM

18:18.198 --> 18:21.834
AND ANY MAN WHO TOUCHES ME
IS GONNA GET HIS ASS KICKED.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.837
- DID HE ATTACK JERRY?
- HE TRIED.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.341
BUT THEN JERRY JUMPED UP
AND GOT IN DOUG'S FACE

18:28.375 --> 18:30.710
AND TOLD HIM
HE WAS GONNA KICK HIS ASS.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.213
- JERRY'S USUALLY
A QUIET GUY.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.316
- YEAH, BUT THAT NIGHT,
HE WAS AMAZING.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.652
I MEAN, JUST THE ENERGY
COMING OFF HIM...

18:39.686 --> 18:40.653
[inhales sharply]

18:40.687 --> 18:43.490
I WAS SO TURNED ON
AFTER THAT.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.657
- EVERYONE WAS.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.394
I WAS WITH
JERRY'S WIFE JANE.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.728
SHE PUSHED ME DOWN
ON THE COUCH

18:48.761 --> 18:50.730
AND SCREWED ME
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.365
- [exhales]

18:52.399 --> 18:55.235
- JERRY DIDN'T SAY
THAT HE BROUGHT HIS WIFE.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.672
- WHY DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
YOU WANNA GUESS?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.341
- WE'RE JUST SAYING
THAT IT WOULD'VE HELPED

19:01.374 --> 19:02.809
TO HAVE KNOWN
ALL THE FACTS,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.877
ESPECIALLY ABOUT
THE SWING SET.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.546
- I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE MENTIONED IT.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.215
I'M JUST SO USED
TO GETTING THE LOOK.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.048
- WHAT LOOK?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.917
- THE ONE YOU'RE
GIVING ME RIGHT NOW.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.786
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND SWING,
SO YOU MUST BE DEVIANTS.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.588
THE LIFESTYLE IS NOT
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS,

19:15.622 --> 19:17.357
AND IT ISN'T ILLEGAL.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.961
- FAIR ENOUGH.

19:21.994 --> 19:22.895
- [sighs]

19:22.929 --> 19:24.964
BUT WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH JERRY?

19:24.997 --> 19:25.798
- WELL, HE WAS NOT
ON HIS WAY

19:25.832 --> 19:27.934
TO WASHINGTON, D.C.
MONDAY NIGHT.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.802
HE WAS AT THE SWING SET.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.871
HE WAS ATTACKED
OUTSIDE THAT PLACE.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.874
- BUT...
[sighs]

19:34.907 --> 19:37.244
WE PROMISED EACH OTHER

19:37.277 --> 19:39.212
WE WOULD ALWAYS
GO TOGETHER

19:39.246 --> 19:40.613
AND WE WOULD LEAVE
TOGETHER.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.449
- EVEN THOUGH YOUR HUSBAND
WAS VERY FOND

19:42.482 --> 19:43.716
OF ANOTHER WOMAN THERE?

19:43.750 --> 19:44.917
- CASSANDRA.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.453
EVERYONE'S FOND OF HER.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.722
NOT ME.
WOMEN AREN'T MY THING.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.958
- BUT YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
WITH THOSE TWO BEING TOGETHER.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.361
- THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF GOING.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.230
IF CASSANDRA EXCITES JERRY,
THEN I'M EXCITED FOR HIM.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.998
- DID YOU EVER WORRY
ABOUT CASSANDRA'S EX?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.234
I UNDERSTAND THERE
WAS A CONFRONTATION THERE

20:01.268 --> 20:02.235
A WEEK AGO?

20:02.269 --> 20:04.237
- OH, GOD.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.239
YOU--YOU THINK DOUG
ATTACKED JERRY?

20:06.273 --> 20:08.741
- WELL, YOUR HUSBAND
DID GET IN HIS FACE.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.909
WHAT'S DOUG'S LAST NAME?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.278
- NO ONE KNOWS
LAST NAMES THERE.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.445
- DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD DESCRIBE HIM

20:12.479 --> 20:13.513
TO A SKETCH ARTIST?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.014
- EASILY.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.484
THE GUY'S A CREEP.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.586
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO IS BACK.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.421
- HEY. HOW ARE YA?

20:21.454 --> 20:23.590
- I THOUGHT I'D
SCARED YOU OFF LAST NIGHT.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.425
- NO, NO, IT WASN'T YOU.
IT WAS US.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.893
WE WERE BOTH
GETTING A LITTLE, UH...

20:26.926 --> 20:27.860
- [indistinct whispering]

20:27.894 --> 20:29.862
- WORKED UP.
- OH.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.265
DOES THAT MEAN TONIGHT YOU'RE
GONNA DO MORE THAN WATCH?

20:32.299 --> 20:34.434
[engine roars]

20:43.943 --> 20:45.845
- EL, HEADS UP.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.247
DOUG'S ON THE WAY IN.

20:49.849 --> 20:50.817
- CASSANDRA!

20:50.850 --> 20:53.286
- DOUG, I TOLD YOU
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.722
[thud, glasses clank]

20:55.755 --> 20:57.357
- GET AWAY
FROM MY GIRLFRIEND.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.460
- I WILL
WHEN SHE ASKS ME TO.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.061
- DOUG, LEAVE US ALONE.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.597
- NOW YOU'RE "US"?
YOU AND THIS PRICK?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.333
MAN, GET OUT OF HERE.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.834
- FREEZE.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.002
- YOU DON'T PLAY WELL
WITH OTHERS, DOUG.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.839
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE?
- NYPD. EVERYBODY RELAX.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.707
- YOU'RE A COP?
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

21:14.741 --> 21:17.644
WE HAVE A KNIFE HERE.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.312
IT LOOKS BRAND NEW.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.613
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR OLD ONE, DOUG?

21:20.647 --> 21:22.382
YOU LEAVE IT STUCK
IN JERRY BULLARD'S CROTCH?

21:22.415 --> 21:23.816
- GET OFF ME.
I AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.885
- SHUT UP AND WALK.

21:27.053 --> 21:30.557
- CASSANDRA, I NEED YOU
TO COME DOWN TO THE PRECINCT.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.006
- "DOUG LOVELESS."

21:47.039 --> 21:48.708
EVEN YOUR NAME SAYS
YOU CAN'T KEEP A GIRLFRIEND.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.677
- [scoffs]
GO TO HELL.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.011
- DOUG YOUR REAL NAME?

21:52.044 --> 21:54.046
- YOU RAN MY PRINTS.
ANYTHING POP?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.449
- NO, AND THAT MAKES ME
EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.052
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE
FOR A WHILE, PAL.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.588
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.023
- YEAH, SO YOU CAN RUN
MY DNA OFF THE CUP.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.958
- SEE? YOU DO KNOW
HOW COPS WORK.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.727
THERE'S NO WAY YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.762
- SPINNING YOUR WHEELS.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

22:09.796 --> 22:13.099
- EXCEPT BARGE INTO A CLUB
THAT YOU HAD BEEN BANNED FROM

22:13.132 --> 22:15.535
AND ASSAULTING A FEW PEOPLE
TO GET INTO MY FACE.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.103
- I BROKE A GLASS.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.705
YOU LAID HANDS ON ME FIRST.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.708
- I WON'T BE TESTIFYING
TO THAT, BADASS.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.910
YOU TAKE SWINGS AT ANYONE
WHO JUST LOOKS AT CASSANDRA?

22:23.943 --> 22:24.911
IS THAT IT?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.579
- THE GUYS IN THAT CLUB
DO A HELL OF A LOT MORE

22:26.613 --> 22:27.680
THAN LOOK.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.416
- SO, YOU SHOW THE GIRL
WHO DUMPED YOU

22:29.449 --> 22:31.017
WHAT A BIG, SCARY MAN
YOU ARE, HUH?

22:31.050 --> 22:34.854
- IF CASSANDRA'S SO SCARED,
THEN WHERE IS SHE?

22:34.887 --> 22:37.757
SHOULDN'T SHE BE HERE
PRESSING CHARGES,

22:37.790 --> 22:39.626
FILING A RESTRAINING ORDER?

22:39.659 --> 22:41.461
- [sighs]
- I DON'T BLAME YA.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.630
LETTING HER
UNDER YOUR SKIN.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.597
SHE'S A FINE PIECE OF ASS.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.700
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
YOU PLAYED THE BIG HERO.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.702
SHE DIDN'T EVEN STICK AROUND
FOR A KISS GOOD-BYE.

22:49.736 --> 22:52.639
- YEAH, WELL, WHERE'D YOU GET
THE SCRAPE ON YOUR FACE?

22:52.672 --> 22:54.641
- YOU ROUGHING ME UP.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.443
- NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S ALL SCABBED OVER.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.777
THAT'S A COUPLE DAYS OLD.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.047
YOU GET IT FROM
ATTACKING JERRY BULLARD

23:01.080 --> 23:02.915
OUTSIDE THE SWING SET
MONDAY NIGHT?

23:02.949 --> 23:04.617
- WHO?

23:04.651 --> 23:07.987
- WHO? THE GUY THAT
YOU LEFT YOUR KNIFE IN.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.723
THAT'S WHY YOU
HAD TO GET A NEW ONE.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.659
- [laughs]

23:12.692 --> 23:13.793
I DIDN'T STAB ANYBODY.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.663
LOOK, I LOST MY OLD KNIFE
THE SAME WAY

23:16.696 --> 23:17.797
THAT I GOT THIS SCRAPE.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.000
56TH STREET, SOME IDIOT
OPENS UP HIS DOOR INTO TRAFFIC.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.769
I HAD TO LAY MY BIKE DOWN.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.036
- AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE
AN INSURANCE CLAIM

23:24.070 --> 23:25.505
TO PROVE THAT.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.708
- I KICKED IN HIS WINDOW.
WE CALLED IT EVEN.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.544
I WANT A LAWYER.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.983
- WELL, HE DIDN'T
COUGH UP MUCH.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.685
- YOU CAN GIVE IT A SHOT
IF YOU WANT.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.219
- IF HE'S THE GUY
THAT ATTACKED BULLARD--

23:40.252 --> 23:42.589
- JILL, YOU DIDN'T SEE
THE RAGE ON HIS FACE

23:42.622 --> 23:43.355
WHEN HE STORMED
INTO THAT CLUB.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.991
- HIS FACE
WON'T PUT HIM AWAY.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.159
WE HAVE NOTHING PROVING
HE WAS IN THAT ALLEY MONDAY

23:47.193 --> 23:49.161
OR TYING HIM TO THE KNIFE
FOUND IN THE VICTIM.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.698
- OKAY, WELL, CASSANDRA SAYS
HE GOES IN THERE ALL THE TIME,

23:51.731 --> 23:53.700
THREATENING HER
OR ANY GUY SHE'S WITH.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.568
- AND WHEN SHE GETS
THE CHANCE TO HELP THE COPS,

23:55.602 --> 23:56.636
SHE BOLTS.

23:56.669 --> 23:57.737
WE CAN'T NAIL
THIS CREEP YET.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.640
- THEN LET JERRY DO IT.
HE JUST WOKE UP.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.012
- I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.747
- MR. BULLARD,
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.583
- I LIED.
I DID A LOT OF BAD THINGS.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.219
- DAD, WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO TO D.C.?

24:13.252 --> 24:14.821
- JANETTE, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO OUT IN THE HALLWAY

24:14.854 --> 24:15.822
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.157
- NO, NO, NO. SHE--
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR THE TRUTH

24:18.190 --> 24:19.526
ABOUT HER FATHER.

24:25.565 --> 24:30.002
HONEY, I, UM,
I GOT INVOLVED IN, UH,

24:30.036 --> 24:31.671
THIS PLACE...

24:33.005 --> 24:36.142
AND I FELL IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.644
- WHAT ABOUT MOM?

24:37.677 --> 24:40.647
- I NEVER WANTED
TO HURT HER OR YOU.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.782
- WHO IS SHE?

24:42.815 --> 24:45.251
- HER NAME IS CASSANDRA.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.185
I NEVER EXPECTED IT
TO HAPPEN.

24:46.218 --> 24:49.656
IT'S JUST WHEN I--
WHEN I FIRST MET HER,

24:49.689 --> 24:52.058
I--I JUST--
I FELT--I FELT--

24:52.091 --> 24:54.293
- ALIVE AGAIN.
- YES.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.628
I HEADED TO THE AIRPORT.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.297
THEN I THOUGHT,
WHAT AM I DOING?

24:58.330 --> 25:01.834
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
STUPID AIRPLANE TIRES.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.239
ALL I WANTED TO DO
IS BE WITH CASSANDRA.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.076
- OKAY, SO, WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU SAW HER?

25:10.109 --> 25:11.644
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHO ATTACKED YOU?

25:11.678 --> 25:13.045
- HELL YES.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.246
HER.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.120
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- YEAH, WE DO.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.622
YOU TRIED TO KILL
YOUR HUSBAND.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.290
- I LOVE JERRY.
- I KNOW YOU LOVED HIM.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.124
YOU TOOK CARE OF HIM.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.993
YOU GAVE HIM
A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.229
AND HOW DOES HE REPAY YOU?
HE DRAGS YOU TO A SEX CLUB.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.931
- WHERE HE TRADES YOU IN
FOR A YOUNGER MODEL.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.199
- OH, PLEASE.

25:33.232 --> 25:36.603
YOU THINK MEN ARE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

25:36.636 --> 25:37.904
MEN ARE THE ONLY ONE
WHO GET TIRED

25:37.937 --> 25:39.606
OF THE SAME OLD
SUNDAY MORNING SEX,

25:39.639 --> 25:40.773
SAME OLD POSITION?

25:40.807 --> 25:44.110
- SO, ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THE SWING SET WAS YOUR IDEA?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.178
- I TOLD YOU,
JERRY IS MR. VANILLA.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.647
- AND YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT CASSANDRA.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.982
- I ONLY CARED
ABOUT HIM SCREWING US,

25:50.016 --> 25:51.984
DESTROYING OUR FUTURE!

25:52.018 --> 25:53.219
[cries]

25:53.252 --> 25:55.054
JERRY...

25:55.087 --> 25:58.591
JERRY WAS TAKING MONEY
OUT OF MY CHECKING ACCOUNT.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.760
JANETTE'S COLLEGE FUND!

26:00.793 --> 26:03.129
$30,000, $40,000, $50,000,

26:03.162 --> 26:04.731
ALL OF IT COMING OUT
OF OUR POCKETS

26:04.764 --> 26:06.132
AND GOING INTO HERS.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.834
[sighs]

26:08.835 --> 26:11.804
OH, DEEP DOWN...

26:11.838 --> 26:15.007
I KNEW
HE WOULDN'T GO TO D.C.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.175
I CALLED THE HOTEL.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.811
THEY CONFIRMED
HE NEVER CHECKED IN.

26:18.845 --> 26:21.347
- AND YOU KNEW
WHERE HE WAS.

26:22.715 --> 26:26.318
- [laughs]

26:26.352 --> 26:29.822
A VOICE INSIDE OF ME
SAID, "DON'T GO.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.858
YOU'LL DO SOMETHING BAD."

26:33.425 --> 26:35.828
I JUST SAT IN
THE DARK HOUSE, DRINKING.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.664
- UNTIL YOU
GRABBED THE KNIFE.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.832
- I--I WENT DOWN
TO THE CLUB.

26:39.866 --> 26:42.001
I WAITED IN THE ALLEY,
AND WHEN HE CAME OUT,

26:42.034 --> 26:44.671
I CALLED HIM OVER,
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,

26:44.704 --> 26:46.038
I WAS STABBING HIM.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.740
- AND YOU GRABBED
HIS WALLET AND HIS PHONE

26:47.774 --> 26:48.675
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
HE WAS MUGGED.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.242
- I SWEAR, WHEN YOU
CAME BY THE NEXT DAY

26:50.276 --> 26:53.245
AND TOLD ME HE WAS ALIVE,
I WAS HAPPY.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.147
I WAS JUST SO DRUNK
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

26:55.181 --> 26:58.150
AND I WAS SO ANGRY
ABOUT THE MONEY!

26:58.184 --> 27:01.153
I...
[cries]

27:01.187 --> 27:04.090
I WAS GONNA BEG FORGIVENESS
THE MOMENT HE WOKE UP.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.126
[crying]

27:10.730 --> 27:12.865
OH, GOD.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.169
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
IT'S NOT THAT DIRTBAG.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.706
- SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
- YOU LET HIM GO.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.340
WIFE CONFESSES,
DIRTBAG WALKS.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.442
- BARGING INTO THE SWING SET
IS TRESPASSING.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.977
- THE CLUB WOULD HAVE
TO PRESS CHARGES.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.445
THEY DON'T WANT
THE PUBLICITY.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.447
- HE TORE UP THE PLACE.
THAT'S CRIMINAL MISCHIEF.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.849
- SO, GIVE HIM A DESK TICKET
AND SEND HIM PACKING.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.050
WITH THE KNIFE.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.385
- THAT'S A WEAPON.
- UNDER FOUR INCHES.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.654
A TOTALLY LEGAL ONE.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.758
- LET'S CUT HIM LOOSE.

27:40.459 --> 27:43.129
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU CLOWNS
TO GET ME A LAWYER.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.731
- IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.
YOU'RE LEAVING.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.065
- IT'S OUR LUCKY DAY TOO.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.466
- OH...

27:47.499 --> 27:50.402
COULDN'T MAKE YOUR CASE.
THAT'S GOTTA STING.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.270
- THE ONLY PAIN
IS GONNA BE YOURS

27:51.303 --> 27:54.140
IF YOU DON'T STAY AWAY
FROM CASSANDRA.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.142
- RIGHT BACK AT YA.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.912
- YOU'RE REALLY BENT
ON BEING A DUMBASS, HUH?

27:59.946 --> 28:01.413
- I'M JUST TELLING YOU
HOW IT IS, OFFICER.

28:01.447 --> 28:04.316
- NO, HERE'S HOW IT IS.
GET OUT.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.485
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.354
- GUY'S GOT MORE BALLS
THAN BRAINS.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.056
- AND BARELY ANY
OF EITHER.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.258
- WELL, HE'S GONNA GO
RIGHT BACK AFTER CASSANDRA,

28:12.291 --> 28:14.160
AND IT'S GONNA BE HARD
FOR US TO PROTECT HER

28:14.193 --> 28:15.327
IF SHE'S IN THE WIND.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.463
- I'LL PUT LIV AND ELLIOT
ON HIS TAIL

28:17.496 --> 28:18.831
SO HE DOESN'T GET
THE CHANCE.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.235
[engine roars]

28:44.523 --> 28:46.225
- CASSANDRA!

28:56.936 --> 29:00.372
- [laughs]

29:01.473 --> 29:06.045
- THEY'RE LOVERS.
- AND WE'VE BEEN PLAYED.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.480
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
GET DOWN HERE.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.916
- WHAT THE HELL?

29:09.949 --> 29:11.517
- ELLIOT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:11.550 --> 29:13.185
- PUTTING AN END
TO THE CHARADE.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.486
YOU'RE BOTH UNDER ARREST.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.989
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.334
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE ARRESTED ME.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.568
I'M A VICTIM.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.939
- YOU'RE A CON ARTIST.
SIT DOWN.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.240
- AND WHAT ARE YOU,
DETECTIVE?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.441
- I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.243
I'M NOT FLEECING GUYS
LIKE JERRY BULLARD

29:37.276 --> 29:38.177
OUT OF THEIR LIFE SAVINGS.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.913
- EXCUSE ME?
- WE FIGURED OUT YOUR SCAM.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.082
YOU GO TO SEX CLUBS,
YOU BAT YOUR EYELASHES,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.450
YOU SUCK MEN
INTO YOUR WEB,

29:44.483 --> 29:47.286
AND THEN YOU SPIN A STORY
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE TERRIFIED

29:47.319 --> 29:48.320
OF YOUR OLD BOYFRIEND,

29:48.354 --> 29:52.892
AND YOU FLASH THAT
NECK SCAR OF YOURS AS PROOF.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.193
- SO, THAT'S
WHEN YOU BARGE IN,

29:54.226 --> 29:56.328
MAKING ALL SORTS
OF JEALOUS THREATS,

29:56.362 --> 29:57.529
AND THEN ONCE YOU LEAVE,

29:57.563 --> 30:00.166
CASSANDRA FALLS
INTO THIS DUPE'S ARMS,

30:00.199 --> 30:01.467
BEGGING FOR HELP.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.235
NOW, HE'S
SO HEAD OVER HEELS

30:03.269 --> 30:05.171
THAT HE'LL JUST COUGH UP
ABOUT ANYTHING SHE WANTS,

30:05.204 --> 30:06.338
RIGHT?

30:06.372 --> 30:08.140
SPENDING MONEY,
A NEW CAR,

30:08.174 --> 30:10.142
MAYBE NEW CLOTHES,
AND A NEW HAIRDO

30:10.176 --> 30:11.477
SO YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE HER.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.446
- YOU HAVE GOT
A GOOD IMAGINATION, LADY.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.215
- SO DO YOU, STEVE.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.385
- MY NAME IS DOUG.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.287
- YEAH, IT IS ON YOUR
NEW YORK DRIVER'S LICENSE.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.156
SEE, BUT WE TOSSED
YOUR LITTLE GRIFTER LOVE NEST,

30:24.190 --> 30:27.026
AND WE FOUND
ALL SORTS OF ALIASES, HUH?

30:27.059 --> 30:29.896
STEVE HARLAN
FROM CALIFORNIA,

30:29.929 --> 30:32.564
JUDD FLEISS, MICHIGAN.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.901
OH, AND MIKE PROGELHOF,
ALABAMA.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.204
THEY JUST KEEP ON GOING.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.572
JUDY VACARRO
FROM CONNECTICUT,

30:40.606 --> 30:43.542
REBECCA FRANKLIN
FROM ILLINOIS,

30:43.575 --> 30:46.145
AND, OF COURSE,
CASSANDRA DAVINA

30:46.178 --> 30:48.280
FROM NEW YORK, WHICH,
AND I GOTTA TELL YA,

30:48.314 --> 30:51.117
THIS IS BY FAR
THE SEXIEST.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.052
- ELLIOT.
- HMM?

30:53.085 --> 30:55.654
- LET ME EXPLAIN.
- NO, LET ME EXPLAIN.

30:55.687 --> 30:59.058
YOU PREY
ON MIDDLE-AGED MEN...

30:59.091 --> 31:00.326
AND THEIR MIDDLE-AGED LIVES,

31:00.359 --> 31:01.928
AND YOU TELL 'EM
HOW SPECIAL THEY ARE,

31:01.961 --> 31:03.195
AND THEN YOU DRAIN 'EM DRY,

31:03.229 --> 31:05.531
AND YOU SKIP TOWN
WITH YOUR BOY DOUG

31:05.564 --> 31:07.900
OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.370
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:13.272 --> 31:17.243
I KNEW YOU WERE SMARTER
THAN ALL THE REST.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.348
- YOU REALLY
CAN'T HELP YOURSELF, CAN YOU?

31:23.382 --> 31:25.084
- SO, YOU TWO RIP MEN OFF,

31:25.117 --> 31:27.219
AND YOU KNEW THAT YOUR VICTIMS
WOULDN'T RAT YOU OUT.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.288
I MEAN, WHO WANTS
TO TELL THE COPS

31:29.321 --> 31:32.524
THAT YOU'RE A PATSY
AND A SWINGER?

31:32.558 --> 31:35.361
- IF NOBODY'S COMPLAINING,
THEN YOU AIN'T GOT NO CASE.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.130
- OH, WE HAVE A CASE.

31:38.164 --> 31:42.434
LARCENY, FRAUD,
SCHEME TO DEFRAUD,

31:42.468 --> 31:44.036
CRIMINAL IMPERSONATION.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.038
EVERY TIME
YOU RUN OUT OF MONEY,

31:46.072 --> 31:47.506
YOU FIND ANOTHER VICTIM.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.376
- GOOD LUCK GETTING
ANY OF THOSE SO-CALLED VICTIMS

31:50.409 --> 31:51.543
ON THE STAND.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.345
- YEAH?
I'M PRETTY SURE

31:53.379 --> 31:55.481
THAT WE CAN CONVINCE
JERRY BULLARD.

31:55.514 --> 31:58.484
- THE THING IS...

31:58.517 --> 32:02.621
HE GAVE ME MONEY
OUT OF THE GOODNESS...

32:02.654 --> 32:03.990
OF HIS OWN HEART.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.057
- WELL, AFTER YOU TOLD HIM

32:05.091 --> 32:06.292
THE BIG, BAD WOLF
WAS AFTER YOU.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.627
- JERRY LOVES ME.
- MM.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.996
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THE BEST PART

32:10.029 --> 32:11.597
ABOUT ALL THIS IS?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.299
ONCE WE'RE DONE WITH YOU,
YOU AND BIKER BOY

32:13.332 --> 32:14.566
GET A FREE TRIP TO MIAMI.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.402
- MIAMI?
- MM-HMM.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.736
- WHAT'S IN MIAMI?

32:17.769 --> 32:20.106
- THERE'S A SWINGERS CLUB
YOU TWO HIT LAST SUMMER.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.743
THE OPEN DOOR.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.612
- HMM. NEVER HEARD OF IT.

32:26.645 --> 32:30.216
- REALLY? BECAUSE
THE NAME PRISCILLA CRUZ

32:30.249 --> 32:32.318
SURE RANG A BELL
WITH THE MIAMI P.D.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.653
IT TURNS OUT YOU AND DOUGIE
ARE PERSONS OF INTEREST

32:34.686 --> 32:36.488
IN THE DEATH OF A SWINGER

32:36.522 --> 32:38.224
NAMED CLAUDE BAILEY.

32:38.257 --> 32:41.293
- NOW, YOU REMEMBER CLAUDE,
DON'T YOU?

32:41.327 --> 32:44.163
HE ENDED UP FACE DOWN
IN A POOL OF BLOOD.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.665
BANK ACCOUNT DRAINED
TO THE TUNE OF $50,000.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.534
- ME AND CASS
WERE NEVER IN MIAMI.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.036
- OF COURSE
YOU DON'T WANNA ADMIT IT.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.371
IT'S THE PLACE
WHERE YOU FINALLY SCREWED UP.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.540
YES, YOU LEFT TOWN
WITHOUT LEAVING FINGERPRINTS,

32:54.573 --> 32:58.077
BUT, UH,
GOOD OLD CLAUDE HERE

32:58.110 --> 33:00.546
GOT A PIECE OF ONE OF YA.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.314
- YEAH, MIAMI P.D.
FOUND SKIN CELLS

33:02.348 --> 33:04.283
UNDERNEATH
CLAUDE'S FINGERNAILS,

33:04.316 --> 33:06.585
AND I BET THAT AS SOON AS
WE SEND YOUR DNA SAMPLES

33:06.618 --> 33:08.554
DOWN TO 'EM,

33:08.587 --> 33:10.689
IT'S GONNA TELL US A STORY
ABOUT WHO MURDERED HIM.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.625
UNLESS YOU
WANNA SAVE SOME TIME

33:13.659 --> 33:16.328
AND JUST TELL ME YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.529
YOU KNOW?

33:17.563 --> 33:21.400
'CAUSE YOU LIKE ME SO MUCH MORE
THAN ALL THOSE OTHER GUYS.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.173
- WELL...

33:27.206 --> 33:28.440
[door opens]

33:28.474 --> 33:31.143
- MY CLIENT DOESN'T HAVE
TO ANSWER THAT.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.145
- YOUR CLIENT?

33:33.179 --> 33:35.447
- I DON'T HAVE A LAWYER.
- YOU DO NOW.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.284
BY REQUEST OF ANOTHER CLIENT
OF MINE, JERRY BULLARD.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.229
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
- I'M NOT.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.231
NOW, IF I CAN HAVE THE ROOM.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.767
- YEAH.
- TOLD YOU HE LOVES ME.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.217
- A LOT OF CHARGES HERE,
MS. HARDWICKE.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.319
I HOPE YOU AREN'T TRYING
TO SUBSTITUTE

34:13.352 --> 34:14.420
QUANTITY FOR QUALITY.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.555
- YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENDANTS
ARE SERIAL CON ARTISTS

34:16.588 --> 34:18.257
WHO'VE DEFRAUDED
COUNTLESS VICTIMS.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.227
- THEN WHY ISN'T THE GALLERY
OVERFLOWING WITH THEM?

34:21.260 --> 34:23.229
- ONE IS SEATED RIGHT THERE.
JERRY BULLARD.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.830
- YOU MEAN THE MAN
WHO'S WILLINGLY PAYING

34:24.863 --> 34:26.332
FOR MY CLIENT'S DEFENSE.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.733
- THAT'S IRRELEVANT.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.502
- MR., UH...SHANKMAN.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.671
- UH...

34:32.704 --> 34:34.840
- WANNA PIPE IN HERE
ON BEHALF OF YOUR CLIENT?

34:34.873 --> 34:35.974
- YES, YES.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.345
MY CLIENT WOULD LIKE TO PLEAD
NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.712
- AS DOES MINE.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.847
- AND THE PEOPLE REQUEST REMAND
FOR BOTH DEFENDANTS

34:41.880 --> 34:45.184
WHO'VE DISPLAYED QUITE A TALENT
FOR TRICKERY, COERCION,

34:45.217 --> 34:46.185
AND THREATS.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.320
BOTH USE ALIASES,
BOTH LACK COMMUNITY TIES,

34:48.354 --> 34:50.322
AND BOTH ARE
AN EXTREME FLIGHT RISK.

34:50.356 --> 34:53.325
- UH, YOUR HONOR, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS OTHER SUSPECT,

34:53.359 --> 34:55.161
BUT MY CLIENT HAS
NO HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

34:55.194 --> 34:57.196
AND HAS NEVER BEEN CHARGED
WITH A CRIME.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.331
- UH, ME NEITHER. I'VE NEVER
EVEN BEEN FINGERPRINTED.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.799
- SIR, IF YOU
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

35:00.832 --> 35:02.234
YOU NEED TO SAY IT
THROUGH COUNSEL.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.236
- BUT HE'S
NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.904
- YOUR HONOR, IN ADDITION
TO THE CHARGES BEFORE YOU,

35:05.937 --> 35:07.406
THE DEFENDANTS
ARE ALSO SUSPECTS

35:07.439 --> 35:08.874
IN AN OUT-OF-STATE MURDER.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.310
IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE
TO ALLOW THEM TO GO--

35:11.343 --> 35:13.212
- ARE YOU ASKING
FOR AN EXTRADITION HOLD?

35:13.245 --> 35:14.246
- WELL, NO.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.648
SPECIAL VICTIMS COLLECTED
THE DEFENDANTS' DNA

35:16.682 --> 35:18.417
AND SENT IT TO MIAMI P.D.,

35:18.450 --> 35:19.885
BUT WE'RE STILL
AWAITING CONFIRMATION.

35:19.918 --> 35:22.388
- THEN YOU'RE TAP-DANCING
WHILE I SHOULD BE AT LUNCH.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.356
BAIL WILL BE SET
FOR EACH DEFENDANT

35:24.390 --> 35:26.225
AT $250,000.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.394
BOTH WILL SURRENDER
THEIR PASSPORTS.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.128
[bangs gavel]

35:33.532 --> 35:34.700
- DON'T WORRY, CASSANDRA.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.302
I'M GONNA GO POST
YOUR BAIL RIGHT NOW.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.270
- THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.
- [indistinct]

35:38.304 --> 35:39.505
- CASS,
WHAT ABOUT MY BAIL?

35:39.538 --> 35:40.739
YOU'RE NOT JUST
GONNA LEAVE ME HERE.

35:40.772 --> 35:44.276
- SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.
- BACKSTABBING BITCH!

35:44.310 --> 35:45.611
- I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU OUTSIDE.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.614
- THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.
THANK YOU.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.385
- YOU ARE MAKING
A FOOL OF YOURSELF.

35:53.419 --> 35:55.287
- NO, I'M NOT.
- SHE'S PLAYING YOU.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.589
CASSANDRA IS NOT
EVEN HER REAL NAME.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.291
- THAT'S HER NAME WITH ME.

35:59.325 --> 36:02.328
CASSANDRA LOVES ME
JUST AS MUCH AS I LOVE HER.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.729
NOW LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.202
- THINK CASSANDRA
WILL MANAGE OUT THERE

36:10.236 --> 36:11.770
WITHOUT HER PARTNER
IN CRIME?

36:11.803 --> 36:13.772
- OH, I'M SURE SHE'LL HAVE
NO PROBLEM RUINING LIVES

36:13.805 --> 36:14.940
ALL ON HER OWN.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.442
- THANK YOU.
[slams down phone receiver]

36:16.475 --> 36:18.944
- WHAT'S UP?
- MIAMI P.D. JUST CALLED.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.380
SAY THEY FAXED OVER
THE DNA RESULTS.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.815
THEY SAY WE GOTTA READ IT
TO BELIEVE IT.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.517
[fax machine whirrs]

36:28.520 --> 36:31.390
SKIN CELLS UNDER
THE DEAD GUY'S FINGERNAILS

36:31.423 --> 36:33.392
ARE A PERFECT MATCH TO DNA
ON THE BOYFRIEND.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.461
- THAT'S IT? DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
DOUG KILLED THE GUY.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.962
- YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S ONE MORE THING

36:36.995 --> 36:40.332
THE DNA SAMPLE FROM DOUG
AND CASSANDRA REVEALED.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.937
- THEY'RE RELATED?
- YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN

36:45.971 --> 36:47.706
WHO'S BEEN HAVING SEX
WITH HER BROTHER.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.942
- THAT'S A LIE.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.447
YOU JUST WANNA RUIN
WHAT I HAVE.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.783
- YOU KNOW WHAT, JERRY?
WE REALLY DON'T CARE.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.386
BUT IF CASSANDRA
IS BANGING HER BROTHER,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.454
THEN WHAT ELSE
IS SHE CAPABLE OF?

37:02.488 --> 37:04.890
DO YOU REALLY WANT
YOUR DAUGHTER AROUND THAT?

37:04.923 --> 37:06.725
- MAYBE IT'S ALL A MISTAKE.

37:06.758 --> 37:07.893
I MEAN,
HOW DO YOU REALLY KNOW

37:07.926 --> 37:09.295
THAT THEY
WERE SLEEPING TOGETHER?

37:09.328 --> 37:10.829
- OKAY, WELL,
THE DAY WE RELEASED DOUG,

37:10.862 --> 37:12.398
HE RAN
INTO CASSANDRA'S ARMS

37:12.431 --> 37:13.865
AND RAMMED HIS TONGUE
DOWN HER THROAT.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.369
- WE ALSO FOUND A USED CONDOM
AT THEIR PLACE

37:17.403 --> 37:18.537
UNDER THE ONLY BED.

37:19.538 --> 37:22.007
- OH, MY GOD.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.975
BUT I LOVE HER...

37:24.009 --> 37:25.644
IN A WAY
I NEVER FELT WITH JANE.

37:25.677 --> 37:29.315
I LOVE CASSANDRA
WITH EVERY BIT OF MY HEART.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.716
WE'RE SOUL MATES.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.287
[sighs]

37:35.321 --> 37:39.958
UH, I--I GAVE UP
MY WHOLE LIFE

37:39.991 --> 37:41.493
TO BE WITH HER.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.470
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
MOVING ON UP, HUH?

37:51.503 --> 37:53.372
NEW HOME, NEW LIFE.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.541
- JERRY INVITED ME
TO LIVE WITH HIM.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.376
SAYS WE'LL HAVE
THE WHOLE PLACE TO OURSELVES.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.578
- WELL, GREAT. YOU CAN BANG HIM
IN EVERY ROOM OF THE HOUSE,

37:59.611 --> 38:02.448
THE WHOLE TIME FANTASIZING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.418
- WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE
WANT FROM ME?

38:06.452 --> 38:09.888
- MM, TO HEAR YOU DEFEND IT.
- THERE'S NOTHING TO DEFEND.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.023
WHAT DOUG AND I DO
IS TOTALLY CONSENSUAL.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.224
- IT'S STILL INCEST.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.728
- THAT WORD DOES NOT EVEN BEGIN
TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE HAVE.

38:16.762 --> 38:20.332
- HOW ABOUT "SICK"?
UH, HOW ABOUT "DEPRAVED"?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.335
- DOUG IS MY TWIN.

38:23.369 --> 38:26.004
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

38:26.037 --> 38:28.374
WE SHARE A SOUL.

38:28.407 --> 38:31.377
EVER SINCE WE CAME TO BE
IN OUR MOTHER'S WOMB,

38:31.410 --> 38:32.478
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.779
WE ALWAYS WILL BE.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.815
- IT'S STILL INCEST.
- TWINCEST.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.486
- WE ARE NOTHING
WITHOUT EACH OTHER.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.020
- WELL, GREAT.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.690
YOU'LL JUST WANNA REMEMBER THAT
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IN MIAMI,

38:44.723 --> 38:48.660
TESTIFYING ON THE STAND
FOR DOUG'S MURDER TRIAL.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.128
- HE'S NOT A MURDERER.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.863
- AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
HANGING OUT WITH JERRY BULLARD

38:51.897 --> 38:53.399
LIKE A BIG, FAT TICK ANYMORE.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.400
THAT'S ABOUT TO END.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.501
HE WAS PRETTY WEIRDED OUT

38:55.534 --> 38:58.103
WHEN WE DROPPED THE BOMB
ABOUT, UH, YOUR BROMANCE.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.372
- YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO SMART?

39:00.406 --> 39:02.474
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH JERRY.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.643
HE WASN'T WEIRDED OUT AT ALL.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.112
IN FACT, HE SAID
I SHOULD GET HOME SOON,

39:07.145 --> 39:10.148
BECAUSE HE HAS
THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ME,

39:10.181 --> 39:11.383
FOR BOTH OF US.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.989
WHAT?

39:18.023 --> 39:20.526
[door hinges squeak]

39:21.527 --> 39:23.862
- JERRY,
IT'S DETECTIVE STABLER!

39:26.498 --> 39:29.067
- HEY, BAIL PAPERS
FOR DOUG.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.180
- IT WAS EASY
GETTING HIM HERE.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.782
I TOLD HIM
NO HARD FEELINGS,

39:43.815 --> 39:46.084
CASSANDRA
WOULD BE HOME SOON.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.455
HE PLOPPED DOWN,
I GAVE HIM A BEER.

39:49.488 --> 39:52.491
HE NEVER EVEN SAW ME
PICK UP HIS KNIFE.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.126
- JERRY,
STEP OUT OF THE WAY.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.168
- NOW CASSANDRA AND I
CAN BE TOGETHER.

40:03.201 --> 40:07.105
FOREVER.
RIGHT, HONEY?

40:07.138 --> 40:08.807
[approaching footsteps]

40:10.776 --> 40:11.843
- NO!

40:11.877 --> 40:13.545
NO!

40:14.846 --> 40:17.015
[crying]
OH, DON'T LEAVE ME.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.717
[sobbing]

40:18.750 --> 40:22.120
I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.958
[crying]

40:34.165 --> 40:35.667
- [sighs]
