<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd.Enjoy The Flick</b></font>

04:36.610 --> 04:39.716
And finally...

04:39.946 --> 04:44.019
How do you fit 30 Iraqis
in one telephone booth?

04:47.521 --> 04:50.297
Tell them that it
does not belong to them!

04:52.926 --> 04:53.836
Goodbye!

04:53.894 --> 04:54.998
Congratulations!

04:55.095 --> 04:56.574
You're very kind, Excellency.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.337
Oh, I'm a mere Prince, Ranjit.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.044
Answerable to His Excellency.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.170
The Emir.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.213
But Ranjit,
you know this deal would mean...

05:04.271 --> 05:06.945
a lot of your friends
will be unhappy with you.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.120
So, how do you explain to them?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.153
To me, profit explains everything.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.221
Everything-

05:13.280 --> 05:15.089
Always the shrewd businessman.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.560
You should rule, Your Excellency
and let me slave in peace.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.595
Allah be with you.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.863
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

05:32.098 --> 05:33.076
Heemaar!

05:33.133 --> 05:34.077
Sorry, sir?

05:34.134 --> 05:35.943
Donkey, Nair, Donkey!

05:36.369 --> 05:38.815
Your India is fully of them.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.849
But seems like only
I run into them in Kuwait.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.117
- Play some music.
- Okay, sir.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.829
Nair, you're still not a Kuwaiti.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.628
Haven't you learn't anything from me.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.858
Sorry, sir.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.026
Thank you.

06:13.773 --> 06:14.808
Just have a little.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.319
Simu, that's it.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.946
- Goodnight.
- No, mama... five minutes.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.217
No five minutes, that's it.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.690
Simu.

06:20.780 --> 06:24.057
Simu. Come on, jump. Jump. Jump.

06:24.150 --> 06:27.620
Jump. Jump. Jump.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.293
Goodnight.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.630
Where's my kiss.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.158
Goodnight.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.200
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't be scared.

06:34.261 --> 06:34.966
Rita.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.132
- Yes, ma'am.
- Just tuck her in.

06:36.663 --> 06:37.971
Keep the door open.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.143
Why is Simu still awake?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.644
Don't worry,
we won't be late for the party.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.052
And anyway... she's a kid,
not your car...

06:48.108 --> 06:49.678
that you can turn off with a key.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.151
You've already star-ted?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.224
Decide... whether you want
to party or fight?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.256
Me?

06:58.919 --> 06:59.989
OK. Let's party.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.740
Nair, your family must be thrilled.

07:10.830 --> 07:11.740
Yes, madam.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.106
It's my daughter's
first visit to India.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.305
Look ahead, Nair.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.244
This isn't India.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.112
- Ranjit.
- What?

07:18.905 --> 07:20.248
Fine, fine... take
your daughter along too.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.045
She's only four years old...

07:21.107 --> 07:22.279
No one will ask her
for any bribe either.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.288
Take her to India.
She'll like it.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.852
- Be in a good mood.
- We'll see.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.330
- And please don't drink too much.
- We'll see.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.167
- Hey, guys.
- How are you, Ranjit?

07:37.223 --> 07:39.066
- Hello, how are you?
- Very good. Hi.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.229
Hi, you're looking beautiful.
As usual.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.365
Hi, how are you?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.407
So nice to see you.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.238
Ashok.

07:46.166 --> 07:46.906
How are you?

07:46.967 --> 07:47.968
Well...

07:48.134 --> 07:51.013
- Ranjit, where's Prem?
- Prem?

07:51.371 --> 07:52.850
I invited him...
Hasn't he shown up yet?

07:52.939 --> 07:55.943
You ruined him,
and then invited him.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.212
Why would he come?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.083
The Fawad deal was his, Ranjit.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.189
You snatched it.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.193
You should never mix
business and friendship.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.056
It's his problem
that he didn't show up.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.766
- Even witches spare friends.
- I am a demon.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.031
- How about some blood?
- No, Mr. Demon.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.504
- You drink it.
- Thank you.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.744
My head's lost
in those Arabic eyes.

09:01.441 --> 09:05.014
"Your lies have plundered me."

09:14.788 --> 09:17.997
My head's lost
in those Arabic eyes.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.437
"Your lies have plundered me."

09:23.430 --> 09:27.071
My head's lost
in those Arabic eyes.

09:27.934 --> 09:31.108
"Your lies have plundered me."

09:32.172 --> 09:34.277
"It was lying inside my chest..."

09:34.340 --> 09:36.377
"in the season of love."

09:36.476 --> 09:38.387
"A single gesture..."

09:38.445 --> 09:40.447
"and I gave my hear-t to you."

09:40.547 --> 09:41.753
"Gave it..."

09:41.815 --> 09:42.850
"Gave it..."

09:42.916 --> 09:44.896
"Gave it..."

09:45.051 --> 09:46.052
"Gave it..."

09:46.119 --> 09:47.120
"Gave it..."

09:47.187 --> 09:49.326
"Gave you my heart..."

09:49.389 --> 09:50.390
"Gave it..."

10:18.218 --> 10:21.893
"Magnificent... simply magnificent."

10:21.955 --> 10:24.060
"You're just so addictive."

10:24.124 --> 10:26.161
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

10:27.060 --> 10:28.437
"Amazing..."

10:28.495 --> 10:30.600
"Your attitude's simply amazing."

10:30.830 --> 10:32.867
"You're so stubborn."

10:33.032 --> 10:35.137
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

10:35.869 --> 10:38.008
"Every time I looked at you."

10:38.071 --> 10:40.176
"L never thought twice."

10:40.240 --> 10:42.186
"A single gesture..."

10:42.242 --> 10:44.222
"and I gave my hear-t to you."

10:44.277 --> 10:45.278
"Gave it..."

10:45.345 --> 10:46.380
"Gave it..."

10:46.446 --> 10:48.426
"Gave it..."

10:48.615 --> 10:49.593
"Gave it..."

10:49.816 --> 10:50.954
"Gave it..."

10:51.017 --> 10:53.088
"Gave you my heart..."

10:53.153 --> 10:54.131
"Gave it..."

10:54.187 --> 10:55.291
"Gave it..."

10:55.355 --> 10:57.426
"Gave it..."

10:57.490 --> 10:58.400
"Gave it..."

10:58.558 --> 10:59.559
"Gave it..."

10:59.626 --> 11:01.902
"Gave you my heart..."

11:01.961 --> 11:03.031
"Gave it..."

12:53.206 --> 12:57.712
Go! Go! Go fast!

12:58.011 --> 13:03.256
You go to the right.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.238
Hello.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.353
Hold on.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.050
'Iraq and Kuwait had shared
a tense relationship for some time.'

13:35.348 --> 13:38.454
'The tension was caused
by what always causes tension'

13:39.185 --> 13:40.129
'Money.'

13:40.987 --> 13:43.297
'Iraq owed Kuwait
14 billion dollars...'

13:43.423 --> 13:44.959
'...that Iraq wanted waived.'

13:45.024 --> 13:46.002
Okay, I'll call you later.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.539
'They were also demanding that
Kuwait produce less oil...'

13:48.928 --> 13:51.204
'...so that oil prices go up...'

13:51.531 --> 13:53.841
'...and Iraq profits more.'

13:55.501 --> 13:57.174
'Amidst these apologies
and threats...'

13:57.470 --> 13:59.347
'...the Iraqis also
accused the Kuwaitis of...

13:59.939 --> 14:01.247
'...stealing oil.'

14:02.041 --> 14:03.884
'We had grown used
to these threats by now.'

14:04.010 --> 14:06.286
'And believed that the
situation wouldn't change'

14:06.979 --> 14:08.219
'But we were wrong.'

14:08.314 --> 14:09.418
'It did.'

14:09.549 --> 14:13.190
'And along with it, changed
the identities of us Kuwaitis.'

14:14.954 --> 14:16.262
Ranjit?

14:17.390 --> 14:21.202
- Ashok called.
- At 3am?

14:22.295 --> 14:26.209
- Apparently Saddam attacked Kuwait.
- Come on, Ranjit.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.975
I am sure there must have been
some minor action at the border.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.179
- Ranjit...
- I've an idea.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.847
Simran and you go to London.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.088
Do you really think
there's some kind of threat?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.144
I don't think so.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.324
I'm sure schools will
be closed for few days.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.925
You can come back in a week.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.391
And everything will be fine.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.023
- Could Saddam have really..
- Nothing has happened.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.067
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, l just...

14:50.356 --> 14:51.835
Do me a favour.
Go back to bed.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.435
Go! I just want to make some calls.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.870
Go. Carry on. - Okay.

14:54.927 --> 14:55.371
Go, go.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.346
Kuwaitis! Come out!

15:11.411 --> 15:15.587
This is our land now!

15:16.849 --> 15:20.160
- Hail Saddam!
- Get down.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.493
Hail Saddam!

15:22.555 --> 15:25.092
Hail Saddam!

15:25.224 --> 15:26.931
Hail Saddam!

15:26.993 --> 15:28.529
Hail Saddam!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.338
- Oh God! How bad is it?
- Very bad!

16:10.903 --> 16:13.042
Just when I need them
most no one takes my calls.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.550
Did you try Sheikh Faisal
at the Internal Ministry?

16:15.842 --> 16:18.118
Don't tell me who to call.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.748
- Why are you shouting?
- I've already tried him, Amrita.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.951
Relax, Ranjit.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.160
The entire Kuwaiti Government is gone.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.526
There's not a single official here.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.060
We're practically without
a government, and you are...

16:29.121 --> 16:30.794
- Gone?
- Yes.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.197
They ran away the
first chance they got.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.872
Don't they have any responsibility
towards their own people?

16:35.928 --> 16:37.134
- Amrita...
- Mummy.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.331
Why is Simu awake?

16:38.397 --> 16:41.401
There's no school today.
Go. Go back to sleep.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.970
Rita, please take her inside.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.513
Go, baby. Go inside, please.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.550
Nair, what's happening outside?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.856
Sir, I avoided the main roads
and took the highway to get here.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.213
The Iraqi army is everywhere.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.257
They're checking everyone.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.586
They're sparing everyone else...

16:56.816 --> 16:58.489
but seeking out
Kuwaitis and killing them.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.059
- Ranjit, why did you call him...?
- Amrita, mind your own business...

17:01.120 --> 17:02.360
and let me do mine.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.025
- Get the car, I'll go get ready.
- Okay sir.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.400
- Now you're going out tool?
- Just calm down.

17:06.592 --> 17:07.569
What's wrong with you?

17:07.894 --> 17:08.804
I'm going to the Embassy.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.804
We'll get out of Kuwait
once even/thing's arranged.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.101
Okay. Relax now.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.326
Nair, don't be scared.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.971
Stop the car!

17:46.999 --> 17:47.943
Get out!

17:48.334 --> 17:51.872
Indian.. Indian..
I'm Indian.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.383
Indian we are Indian.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.550
Don't talk with them
in Arabic language.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.183
Nair please sit in the car.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.416
Nair!

18:46.726 --> 18:48.763
Get in!

18:54.700 --> 18:56.179
Play the music.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.683
What's that shining in your hand?
Give it to us.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.944
Good, good!

19:28.868 --> 19:30.040
Come on, move.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.518
'You must be really happy today'.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.887
Amitabh Bachchan...?

19:42.848 --> 19:43.826
Deewar...?

19:44.984 --> 19:47.726
Mr. Ranjit, yes or no?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.237
If I hadn't passed through
that checkpoint today...

19:59.899 --> 20:02.971
then you wouldn't be still alive,
Mr. Ranjit.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.241
Let me guess...

20:07.773 --> 20:11.118
You didn't recognise me.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.758
A year ago... you came to Baghdad...

20:20.119 --> 20:24.033
with your wife Amrita
and daughter Simran...

20:24.090 --> 20:25.330
for a Fundraiser.

20:25.691 --> 20:29.366
And by the grace of Allah...
who was your security in-charge?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.108
I was with you for two days...

20:35.801 --> 20:38.611
yet you don't recognise me.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.179
I am kind of hum, Mr. Katiyal.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.853
- I remember...
- No! You don't!

20:50.616 --> 20:55.588
Successful people...
should only remember important people.

20:55.654 --> 20:59.363
And now... suddenly...
I am someone important.

21:00.126 --> 21:04.802
Mr. Khallaf Bin Zayed.
Iraqi Republican Army.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.706
- At your service.
- Thank you.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.013
I'll give you plenty
of oppurtunities...

21:10.069 --> 21:12.106
to express your gratitude.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.615
Like I gave him.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.045
Fawad?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.757
<i>Fawad Al Sawed.</i>

21:20.913 --> 21:22.915
Your business partner.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.693
Al An Hazir Iraq, Mr. Katiyal.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.194
Now this is Iraq.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.424
And people like you...

21:30.890 --> 21:34.133
will help us keep it that way.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.969
I'm taking another step towards that.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.236
A small gift.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.635
This sticker.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.714
Put it on the windshield of your car.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.384
It'll be helpful at checkpoints.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.187
Otherwise... we could
be meeting every day.

21:55.414 --> 21:58.088
We're friends now, Mr. Ranjit.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.422
If you ever need anything...

22:00.753 --> 22:03.893
don't hesitate.

22:04.089 --> 22:07.093
In return... l'm sure
you too honor this friendship.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.034
You can go.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.456
Mr.Saini.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.355
Mr. Katiyal, over here.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.992
Thank God you saw me.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.256
It's okay.

22:38.023 --> 22:38.831
Brij!

22:38.958 --> 22:41.234
Brij! What the hell is happening?

22:41.460 --> 22:42.905
What happened? Calm down.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.876
A 16 year old Iraqi
soldier shot my driver.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.012
They dragged me to the Dasman palace.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.206
I couldn't tell if...

22:50.269 --> 22:52.840
that Iraqi Major
was being friendly...

22:52.905 --> 22:53.940
or threatening me.

22:54.006 --> 22:54.984
And you're asking what happened?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.348
Come, sit.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.217
Have some water.

22:58.477 --> 22:59.922
We'll son it out, don't worry.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.163
- I am sorry.
- No, it's okay.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.702
What is the airport situation?

23:23.102 --> 23:24.843
The Iraqis have control over it.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.575
No one can come in.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.982
And there's no question of leaving.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.711
And the Indian Government?

23:29.875 --> 23:31.183
As usual, must be watching the show.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.421
Your Kuwaiti government...

23:32.478 --> 23:33.548
didn't even wait
for the show to start.

23:33.679 --> 23:34.783
They fled.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.517
Policy decisions
are not made in hours.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.060
And the entire world's
watching the show.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.560
Brij, do something.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.431
Get me and my family out of here.

23:47.493 --> 23:48.494
We have to get out.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.905
Yes. And so do another
170,000 Indians.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.007
But how will you?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.549
Okay... do one thing.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.617
Bring your family here.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.022
Take her.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.191
Look! What a fancy house!

25:15.648 --> 25:17.025
Look, a Kuwaiti Teddy!

25:19.685 --> 25:21.096
Dead Kuwaiti Teddy!

26:42.768 --> 26:43.872
What are you doing?

26:44.703 --> 26:47.149
Give me your ID.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.986
Okay, you can go.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.597
Amrita!

27:03.722 --> 27:05.065
Amrita!

27:06.592 --> 27:07.900
Simu!

27:10.996 --> 27:12.566
Amrita!

27:13.699 --> 27:15.076
Amrita!

27:17.002 --> 27:18.174
Amrita!

27:19.738 --> 27:20.842
Simu!

27:23.442 --> 27:24.546
Simu!

27:26.512 --> 27:27.684
Amrita!

27:39.858 --> 27:40.893
Simu!

28:52.497 --> 28:53.908
Joseph, did anyone call from home?

28:53.966 --> 28:54.808
Ranjit.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.981
- Do you know how scared I was?
- Papa!

29:02.040 --> 29:05.078
You have no idea howl
brought Simu in here.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.185
Where were you?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.693
Ranjit, please. Let's just leave.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.563
You were saying that
we should go to London.

29:18.690 --> 29:19.760
Let's go to London.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.530
- Just get us out of here.
- Nair's been shot.

29:21.627 --> 29:24.665
- Are you even listening?
- Amrita, Nair's been shot.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.542
Nair?

29:28.867 --> 29:30.141
So were you at the hospital?

29:31.069 --> 29:32.571
How is he now?

29:38.577 --> 29:39.647
Ranjit.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.617
- Ranjit.
- He's dead.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.623
- What?
- Yeah...

29:45.617 --> 29:48.188
They killed him...
right in front of my eyes.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.133
Little kids are walking
around with guns.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.866
Fawad Al Sayyed was
hanging off a crane.

29:56.995 --> 29:59.805
- Oh <i>my...</i>
- So what is Ranjit Katiyal worth?

30:01.700 --> 30:05.477
I couldn't even ask
about Nair's body.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.610
His wife just called.

30:26.792 --> 30:27.702
Mother.

32:10.829 --> 32:13.366
Mr. Ranjit, why are you standing?

32:13.432 --> 32:15.105
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

32:15.233 --> 32:16.371
Not here.

32:18.236 --> 32:19.271
Here.

32:28.313 --> 32:31.988
There's a price to everything,
Mr. Ranjit.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.761
I am ready to pay.

32:35.187 --> 32:38.862
The Kuwaiti Dinar is worthless now.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.730
300,000 dollars for 3 people.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.240
- We are five.
- Five?

32:48.734 --> 32:51.340
My driver's wife and his child.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.740
Driver's wife...

32:58.043 --> 33:00.990
This is your chance to
get out with your family.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.720
Don't get involved in social work...

33:03.849 --> 33:05.522
you'll only get stuck further.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.231
I'm not the type who gets stuck.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.459
Anyway... l can arrange for your money.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.267
Very good!

33:17.095 --> 33:18.073
Thank you.

33:20.732 --> 33:21.472
Joseph.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.344
- How much do we have?
- Earlier, there were 200.

33:24.403 --> 33:25.438
- And now..
- I'm talking about cash.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.508
Sir, thank God you've come.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.410
It now feels like
things will get better.

33:30.475 --> 33:31.749
We're scared.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.186
Please tell us what to do.

33:34.880 --> 33:35.790
Sir...

33:58.870 --> 34:02.010
Joseph, make a list of our
staff and their families.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.186
See if we can accommodate
everyone here.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.845
Otherwise,
we'll make other arrangements.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.213
Relax everyone.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.324
Sit.

34:12.050 --> 34:12.994
Relax.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.831
What do you think you're doing?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.869
Why aren't you getting us out of here?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.728
I can't just desert them, can I?

34:23.862 --> 34:25.341
But you can desert us.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.906
Don't you have any
responsibility towards us?

34:29.134 --> 34:30.135
Of course I do.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.210
But these people work for me.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.277
They have the same
expectations from us...

34:34.339 --> 34:36.341
as we did
the Kuwaiti government.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.416
How can anyone run from
their responsibilities...

34:43.481 --> 34:45.154
- these were your words.
- Yes, they were.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.159
But it's easy to make tall claims.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.389
That was my mistake.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.322
But you're making an even bigger one.

34:50.388 --> 34:51.924
And why this sudden
urge to be a Messiah?

34:51.989 --> 34:53.969
I have no interest in being a Messiah.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.101
I too want to get us out of here.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.239
But... once I make
some arrangements for them.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.292
Take care of yourselves.

35:19.584 --> 35:22.224
Soon we'll make some arrangements.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.862
Did you eat?

35:24.823 --> 35:26.131
Did you eat?

35:40.872 --> 35:42.374
Give me some space.

35:42.607 --> 35:44.143
Where do you expect me to sleep?

35:44.442 --> 35:45.614
Strange problem.

35:45.877 --> 35:46.582
Calm down.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.484
Isn't there enough of
a battle for space outside?

35:49.548 --> 35:50.925
Stop being childish.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.393
Come here.
Here.

35:52.517 --> 35:53.427
Come on.

35:54.386 --> 35:57.299
There's space here.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.190
Excuse me.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.689
The toilets have become very dirty.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.627
They're stinking.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.192
You're the <i>boss,</i> aren't you?

37:02.787 --> 37:04.323
That's why I am telling you.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.167
- Do you work here?
- No!

37:06.224 --> 37:08.261
Hey come here.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.406
Let me know when it's clean.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.332
I'm in this room.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.700
Hey, move aside.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.645
I'm not going to be called a refugee
along with these drivers and coolies...

37:17.702 --> 37:19.704
- Sir, any problem?

37:20.338 --> 37:22.215
- Who is he?
- I don't know, sir.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.209
Around 100 more came here last night.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.820
There are many like him.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.457
More than 1000 Indians
are waiting outside.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.024
How did they get here?

37:31.082 --> 37:33.688
Sir, they say they're friends,
relatives, etcetera...

37:33.752 --> 37:35.163
of our employees.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.164
They had nowhere to go.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.665
So they came here...

37:37.722 --> 37:39.360
because they feel
safer when they're together.

37:41.893 --> 37:45.397
Sir... it's hard to arrange
food for 500 people.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.902
What will we do with 1600?

37:49.434 --> 37:51.436
If you want, I can identify
those who work for us...

37:51.669 --> 37:53.478
and ask the rest to leave?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.248
No!

38:09.854 --> 38:11.128
Hello, sir.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.301
This way.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.970
Wasn't Ranjit heading here?

38:20.598 --> 38:22.669
But I heard the situation
is pretty bad in the city center.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.046
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

38:26.171 --> 38:27.582
- Hey, Ranjit.
- He's here.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.614
How are you?

38:29.040 --> 38:29.984
Thank you.

38:30.775 --> 38:33.119
Ranjit, you too?
In the day?

38:33.244 --> 38:35.815
Saddam has turned
everything on its head.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.755
Ranjit, when all
this is over tomorrow...

38:39.951 --> 38:43.194
you'll have an exciting
story to tell your grandchildren.

38:43.354 --> 38:46.665
Like "When uncle Saddam
was swirling Kuwait around..."

38:46.891 --> 38:50.304
l was swirling a glass of
scotch in Kurien uncle's supermarket.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.931
- So it'll all be over tomorrow?
- Of course, Ranjit.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.405
You think America will stay quiet?

38:54.766 --> 38:56.109
So what is America waiting for?

38:56.201 --> 38:58.010
For us to finish our scotch.

38:58.203 --> 38:59.614
Calm down, Ranjit.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.283
They'll keep us afraid of
the villain for a couple of days.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.979
Then tell the Arabs,
'look at what happened to Kuwait.'

39:04.242 --> 39:06.244
'Let us in... build a military base.'

39:06.344 --> 39:07.288
'And we'll keep you safe.'

39:07.345 --> 39:09.154
And everything will
be back to business.

39:09.214 --> 39:10.318
It's a question of a few days.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.925
So gentlemen, this is everything.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.726
You guys can take what you want.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.424
Ranjit.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.133
- Ibrahim.
- Yes, sir.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.170
Ranjit sir... l'm sure
you haven't brought a truck.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.933
So Ibrahim will load up...

39:22.994 --> 39:24.735
and deliver it to your office.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.341
Tell me something...

39:27.732 --> 39:30.212
Why are we dividing all the food?

39:32.871 --> 39:35.784
Why don't we all
gather at one place...

39:35.907 --> 39:37.853
and take all the stuff there.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.950
You know,
if we Indians stay together...

39:42.447 --> 39:44.393
- What happened?
- We Indians?

39:44.749 --> 39:45.250
Oh, come on!

39:45.316 --> 39:47.193
Since when did you
become an Indian, Ranjit?

39:47.252 --> 39:48.788
Weren't you always a Kuwaiti.

39:49.754 --> 39:52.667
Ranjit, let's just take the
first flight out of here.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.228
Saddam has attacked them.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.396
Why should we be bothered?

39:55.460 --> 39:56.996
What's the bother?

39:57.429 --> 39:59.807
All we need is a big space,
that's all.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.209
It's a question of
couple of days, Ranjit.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.838
- What's the problem?
- Hold on.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.342
- Ranjit is right.
- Let's solve our own problems.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.751
Trying to help 170,000..

40:12.143 --> 40:15.215
will only add to our problems.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.021
Come on, Ibrahim.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.052
Ashok...

40:23.955 --> 40:25.866
outside of this supermarket...

40:26.090 --> 40:28.195
nobody recognizes you or me.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.396
We have no standing.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.375
The only thing we
have is our identity.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.444
We're Indian, not Kuwaiti.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.810
Together we're something...

40:40.705 --> 40:41.740
If not...

40:42.874 --> 40:43.852
Nothing!

40:52.083 --> 40:55.929
It's old whiskey... but not
worth 500,000 dollars, Mr. Ranjit.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.365
I did try to tell you...

41:01.426 --> 41:04.373
Getting involved
in social work is a trap.

41:06.397 --> 41:07.842
That's not it, sir.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.100
Once the camp is set up...

41:09.167 --> 41:11.238
I'll leave with my wife and child.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.339
As long as you're with us.

41:13.404 --> 41:17.181
Aah... you're trying to flatter me.

41:19.410 --> 41:22.823
Even the President considers
Indians as friends.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.057
You can setup camp anywhere you want.

41:25.183 --> 41:27.356
- You have my permission.
- Thank you.

41:28.119 --> 41:31.760
But why take your family to the camp?

41:33.057 --> 41:35.799
Tell your wife it's safe at home.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.038
You have my word.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.230
Thank you.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.006
Come on.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.274
Excuse me.

42:54.872 --> 42:55.907
There are classrooms at the back.

42:55.973 --> 42:56.917
You can sleep there.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.815
There are bathrooms here too.

42:59.143 --> 43:01.589
There's water available
here.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.784
And Ashok's trying to find out.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.788
You see... we can put up tents here...

43:07.852 --> 43:09.957
and let people sleep.

43:10.154 --> 43:11.861
- Ranjit.
- Yes, Ashok.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.199
The canteen's on that side.
We can serve them meals in there.

43:16.227 --> 43:17.228
Simu.

43:18.196 --> 43:19.197
Simu!

43:20.264 --> 43:21.174
Simu!

43:23.201 --> 43:24.236
Simu!

43:24.869 --> 43:25.870
Simu!

43:26.771 --> 43:27.875
Simu!

43:29.073 --> 43:29.983
Simu!

43:30.408 --> 43:31.751
Mom.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.250
Simu, out of the bus!

43:36.280 --> 43:38.260
I told you to stay right here!

43:38.783 --> 43:39.625
Come on.

43:40.418 --> 43:41.192
Come here.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.691
You can stay here.

43:47.158 --> 43:49.434
This is my luggage-

43:50.161 --> 43:51.765
What do you mean by that?

43:54.666 --> 43:57.806
- This is my room.
- No, we'll shift to some other room.

43:58.336 --> 44:02.443
It should be first come, first served.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.180
I saw it first.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.414
What do you think this is...

44:05.743 --> 44:07.051
'finders keepers'?

44:07.345 --> 44:09.689
- We'll go..
- No, no, not at all.

44:09.747 --> 44:12.785
If she's okay...

44:19.123 --> 44:20.431
Nonsense!

44:21.859 --> 44:22.860
Come here.

44:30.468 --> 44:31.811
- Come on, let's go.
- No!

44:31.869 --> 44:33.871
We won't stay here.

44:34.439 --> 44:36.419
We'll all be together here.
It'll be safe.

44:36.474 --> 44:37.282
Safe!

44:37.742 --> 44:39.949
I found Simu playing with this!
A bullet!

44:41.913 --> 44:43.790
You can help them settle down,
if you want.

44:43.881 --> 44:45.155
Don't involve us.

44:46.150 --> 44:47.322
- Amrita...
- No.

44:47.819 --> 44:50.163
When you're ready,
pick us up from home.

44:50.755 --> 44:52.928
The Major has guaranteed
our safety, hasn't he?

44:55.126 --> 44:56.264
I'm leaving.

44:58.896 --> 44:59.897
Are you coming?

45:03.468 --> 45:04.811
Okay, sit.

45:11.709 --> 45:12.949
- I'll drop her home.
- Okay.

45:13.010 --> 45:14.182
Take care of things.

45:26.824 --> 45:27.962
What are you doing?

45:29.160 --> 45:30.935
Get lost.

45:30.995 --> 45:32.804
Get lost.

45:34.432 --> 45:36.036
Is this a picnic?

45:37.368 --> 45:38.472
There's a war going on...

45:38.703 --> 45:40.080
Do you have any sense?

45:40.805 --> 45:42.045
No discipline at all.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.310
Look at him screaming.

45:43.374 --> 45:44.352
Who's that?

45:44.742 --> 45:46.346
- It can be only one guy?
- Who?

45:46.811 --> 45:47.755
My husband.

45:55.019 --> 45:56.362
Let me take him...

45:56.420 --> 45:58.798
While you eat something.

46:03.895 --> 46:06.501
I'll take it... We'll eat later.

46:23.147 --> 46:24.353
Ashok, we've finished our scotch...

46:24.415 --> 46:25.894
Where is America?

46:25.950 --> 46:27.861
Forget America... Where's India?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.356
Around 150,000 Indians are stuck here.

46:30.421 --> 46:31.729
Is anyone concerned?

46:32.290 --> 46:33.462
They haven't done anything for us.

46:33.524 --> 46:35.231
It's not like we've done anything
for India either.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.374
You might
not have done anything.

46:38.429 --> 46:40.534
We send millions of Dinar to India.

46:41.165 --> 46:44.271
They want our Dinar...

46:44.936 --> 46:46.882
but they don't
care about our lives.

46:47.205 --> 46:50.118
If this had
been a western country...

46:50.274 --> 46:52.481
their embassy would've
gotten their people out by now.

46:52.844 --> 46:54.346
The embassy can do something...

46:54.412 --> 46:56.255
only if they know
that we've setup a camp.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.385
- How will they find out? When we..
- What's this?

46:59.784 --> 47:01.786
There's no discipline in the camp.

47:05.223 --> 47:06.031
What?

47:06.958 --> 47:07.993
Didn't you hear?

47:09.160 --> 47:10.298
I heard.

47:10.561 --> 47:11.767
Good.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.815
Let's go to the embassy.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.657
- Kurien, look there.
- Yes.

47:43.027 --> 47:44.904
- Where's everyone?
- Gone.

47:45.129 --> 47:45.869
Gone?

47:45.963 --> 47:47.203
Where's Brij?

47:47.431 --> 47:49.104
The entire embassy has been evacuated.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.335
I'm leaving too.

47:50.835 --> 47:53.179
Saddam says there's no point in
having two embassies in one country.

47:53.371 --> 47:54.748
All the embassies
are in Baghdad anyway.

47:54.805 --> 47:57.684
So will all the Indians
go to Baghdad now?

47:57.742 --> 47:59.415
No point yelling at me.

47:59.744 --> 48:01.155
Talk to the External
Affairs Ministry in Delhi.

48:01.312 --> 48:02.416
They'll tell you
what Indians should do.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.687
- What nonsense.
- Wait. Wait.

48:04.849 --> 48:05.953
Do you have any number?

48:06.017 --> 48:07.087
Someone we can call?

48:16.961 --> 48:18.235
Mr. Mishra, come.

48:18.996 --> 48:19.997
Come on.

48:50.795 --> 48:52.866
Hello, Ministry of External Affairs.

48:53.064 --> 48:56.204
This is Ranjit Katiyal
speaking from Kuwait city.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.107
Yes.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.079
We've been given a few numbers...

48:59.336 --> 49:01.009
By the way, who is this?

49:01.272 --> 49:04.014
Joint Secretary, Sanjeev Kohli.

49:04.075 --> 49:06.021
I wanted to talk to you about...

49:06.077 --> 49:08.216
the situation of
Indians living in Kuwait.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.320
We Indians have setup
camp in Apex School...

49:11.582 --> 49:14.358
Look,
I don't handle the Gulf Division.

49:14.685 --> 49:16.824
You've been given the wrong number.

49:16.887 --> 49:19.060
Look Mr. Kohli, we need help.

49:19.223 --> 49:21.294
And we need it right now.

49:22.059 --> 49:22.969
Well...

49:25.129 --> 49:27.609
I'll communicate this...

49:27.765 --> 49:30.678
to the Joint
Secretary of the Gulf division.

49:30.735 --> 49:32.646
Give me the number to your school.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.351
Green chilly?

49:41.045 --> 49:42.353
No, thanks.

49:42.647 --> 49:43.819
Meher! Meher!

49:46.917 --> 49:48.260
This is where we're going to live?

49:48.619 --> 49:49.825
With these people?

49:50.154 --> 49:51.792
- I'm leaving!
- Dad!

49:52.122 --> 49:54.068
They are killing people outside.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.066
Meher, Saddam has guaranteed...

49:56.127 --> 49:58.403
that Iraqis won't hurt Indians.

49:58.629 --> 49:59.403
How would they know...

49:59.630 --> 50:00.938
who's Kuwaiti, who's Indian?

50:00.998 --> 50:03.000
Meher... The bank has
my entire life's savings...

50:03.067 --> 50:04.137
not yours!

50:06.904 --> 50:07.974
I'm leaving!

50:14.879 --> 50:16.017
It's okay, dear.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.386
It'll be okay.

50:21.085 --> 50:22.359
Let me do it.

50:22.887 --> 50:24.093
Can I tie that for you.

50:24.622 --> 50:26.260
Allow me...

50:26.724 --> 50:27.634
What?

50:28.959 --> 50:29.937
What did you say?

50:29.994 --> 50:31.439
Are you Kuwaiti?

50:40.571 --> 50:41.549
You go ahead.

50:44.809 --> 50:46.152
Sheer insensitivity.

50:46.644 --> 50:49.716
There's no communication from
the External Ministry yet.

50:49.813 --> 50:51.156
- While taking our number...
- Papa!

50:51.315 --> 50:53.989
My sweetie-pie.

50:54.185 --> 50:55.892
Hello, stranger.

50:57.555 --> 51:00.126
This is the first nice
surprise after 2nd August.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.169
You hardly ever come home.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.697
So I have to bring Simu
here to see her father, don't I?

51:05.763 --> 51:06.764
Thank you.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.602
What's going on?

51:11.669 --> 51:13.171
Nothing much. We've been trying to
reach the External Affairs Ministry...

51:13.237 --> 51:14.944
in Delhi for four days,
but haven't managed to.

51:15.306 --> 51:16.148
Hello, ma'am.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.048
- How are you?
- Fine.

51:17.107 --> 51:17.744
Yes.

51:17.808 --> 51:18.718
Come, Simu.

51:18.776 --> 51:20.722
I'll show you something really nice.

51:21.612 --> 51:23.990
- Are you enjoying all this?
- What?

51:24.048 --> 51:27.621
I have no idea when you come or go.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.690
I'm trying to son all this.

51:30.888 --> 51:32.834
- Our people..
- Our people?

51:33.657 --> 51:35.000
Our people?

51:36.060 --> 51:38.973
Calling Delhi every day,
playing Indian Indian...

51:39.330 --> 51:41.037
Since when did you
star-t caring so much about them?

51:41.298 --> 51:43.574
Whenever I spoke about
going to India... - Amrita.

51:43.701 --> 51:46.614
Amrita, once we have
some clarity from Delhi..

51:46.670 --> 51:49.378
about the status of our people
we'll get out of here.

51:49.607 --> 51:50.915
- Hello, ma'am.
- Yeah.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.886
Will you answer one question?

51:56.313 --> 51:57.792
And I'm not asking in anger.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.593
Why? Why all this?

52:00.884 --> 52:01.794
Why this charade?

52:01.852 --> 52:05.800
And what are you
suddenly trying to be?

52:06.357 --> 52:07.597
Ranjit?

52:12.363 --> 52:14.673
- Look at these people.
- Why?

52:15.065 --> 52:16.203
Amrita, look at them.

52:18.402 --> 52:20.882
Some of them have been
working in our office...

52:20.938 --> 52:22.849
for 5... 10... 12 years.

52:23.841 --> 52:25.878
But I didn't even know their names.

52:26.944 --> 52:29.618
Unfortunately, now I do.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.259
If we walk away...

52:34.251 --> 52:36.356
we will be leaving these
names behind, not just any crowd.

52:37.087 --> 52:39.795
It's true, they're not related to us.

52:40.891 --> 52:42.700
But neither was Nair.

52:44.195 --> 52:45.799
And he lost his life.

52:46.130 --> 52:48.303
And it's not like I'm giving up
my life for these people.

52:51.035 --> 52:54.016
If I turn away now, won't you ask...

52:54.438 --> 52:56.782
"Ranjit, what kind of a man are you?"

52:59.843 --> 53:00.981
Ranjit!

53:06.917 --> 53:08.863
Sir, we're Indians.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.760
We have permission.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.296
We have permission.

53:46.390 --> 53:50.463
- Ismail, Mani. Go hide the food.
- Okay.

55:51.648 --> 55:53.628
Good to see you, Mr. Ranjit.

55:53.984 --> 55:56.624
Where's my whiskey today?

55:59.156 --> 56:00.726
Your soldiers came...

56:00.791 --> 56:02.270
They looted our camp.

56:02.626 --> 56:03.798
I am sorry.

56:03.961 --> 56:05.804
But what can they do?

56:05.863 --> 56:07.809
Baghdad sent us...

56:07.998 --> 56:10.069
but forgot our supplies.

56:10.567 --> 56:13.605
They thought we could depend
on your hospitality.

56:13.837 --> 56:16.249
But... why are you so worried?

56:16.640 --> 56:18.847
It's not like they
really did anything to you.

56:19.009 --> 56:19.885
Did they?

56:19.977 --> 56:21.183
Maybe they will come back.

56:21.245 --> 56:22.349
I can't stop them.

56:22.579 --> 56:24.581
How do I ensure the
safety of my people?

56:25.315 --> 56:28.228
Ranjit! Ranjit! Ranjit!

56:28.652 --> 56:32.293
Now I know for sure you're trapped.

56:32.756 --> 56:35.760
You can all leave Kuwait
anytime if you want.

56:36.126 --> 56:39.300
The President, like me, is
a friend of Indians.

56:39.630 --> 56:42.008
And he has already
permitted Indians to leave.

56:42.066 --> 56:46.310
- You never told me that.
- You never asked.

56:46.604 --> 56:48.049
And that's why you never told me?

56:49.706 --> 56:50.844
May Allah be with you.

56:56.914 --> 56:59.258
But Ranjit... tell me..

57:00.083 --> 57:03.189
Where will you go
with all these people?

57:07.057 --> 57:09.435
- Yes, sir?
- Joseph. My medicines are almost over.

57:09.860 --> 57:10.964
I'll look into it, sir.

57:11.295 --> 57:14.071
What if the soldiers come back?

57:14.131 --> 57:15.201
There's nothing we can do, sir.

57:15.265 --> 57:16.938
- Joseph.
- Yes, sir.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.068
Excuse me.

57:18.769 --> 57:20.214
Make a list...

57:20.337 --> 57:21.338
of the people here.

57:21.705 --> 57:22.683
Write down all their names.

57:22.739 --> 57:24.275
We should know how
many people are here.

57:24.741 --> 57:25.913
And what are we doing about food now?

57:25.976 --> 57:27.785
Sir, we still have food for 2-3 days.

57:27.844 --> 57:30.723
Ibrahim managed
to hide half the food.

57:32.850 --> 57:34.727
Thank God.
Well, that's good.

57:35.319 --> 57:37.526
But why are you calling me?

57:37.754 --> 57:40.166
I already passed on
the number to the Gulf Desk.

57:40.324 --> 57:41.997
Sir, no one has called
from the Ministry yet.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.231
And they probably never will.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.362
- I need your help.
- What?

57:45.729 --> 57:48.141
Look, Saddam Hussain has permitted...

57:48.198 --> 57:50.269
us Indians to get out of Kuwait.

57:51.001 --> 57:52.742
But we don't know where to go...

57:52.803 --> 57:53.975
when or how?

57:54.037 --> 57:56.779
If you could help us,
then it'll be really great.

57:56.840 --> 57:59.946
Let me speak to the
Minister and call you back.

58:02.813 --> 58:03.382
Okay.

58:03.747 --> 58:04.691
Yes, Kohli.

58:04.781 --> 58:06.886
Those Indians stuck in Kuwait...

58:06.950 --> 58:09.157
Talk to Sharma at the Gulf Desk.

58:09.286 --> 58:11.129
Sir, if you could just
put in a word.

58:11.188 --> 58:13.691
Kohli! The Prime
Minister's waiting for me.

58:14.024 --> 58:14.832
Hurry HP!

58:16.894 --> 58:18.703
Father's name, Vasudevan.

58:19.129 --> 58:20.073
Trichur.

58:20.197 --> 58:21.369
Okay, please.

58:21.832 --> 58:22.936
Next.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.283
We must tell sir now.

58:38.782 --> 58:40.386
Ibrahim, have you lost your mind?

58:41.418 --> 58:43.056
You shouldn't have
hidden this from me!

58:43.787 --> 58:46.324
If those Iraqi soldiers
had found out...

58:47.090 --> 58:48.763
that she's a Kuwaiti.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.233
They would've shot
everyone in the camp.

58:54.665 --> 58:56.440
Sir, I didn't think about that.

58:56.733 --> 58:59.976
I only thought about what
they would've done to her.

59:06.109 --> 59:07.417
But honestly, sir...

59:07.778 --> 59:11.157
what is the proof
that we're not Kuwaiti.

59:12.015 --> 59:14.325
Most of them don't have any documents.

59:15.118 --> 59:16.756
Agents have their passports.

59:17.321 --> 59:18.959
Who will believe we're Indian?

59:28.866 --> 59:30.174
Mr. Ranjit Katiyal.

59:30.434 --> 59:33.108
Look, I couldn't find out much.

59:33.170 --> 59:35.446
But I was informed
by the Gulf Division that...

59:35.972 --> 59:38.452
you could possibly go to Jordan.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.115
Possibly?

59:41.278 --> 59:45.385
But Mr. Kohli,
many of us don't have passports.

59:45.516 --> 59:49.020
- What do we do?
- I don't know about that.

59:49.286 --> 59:50.458
But...

59:51.455 --> 59:53.765
Do you have any contacts in Baghdad?

59:54.525 --> 59:55.731
Are you crazy?

59:56.860 --> 59:57.998
He'll go to Iraq?

59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.135
Do you think it's a picnic?

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.936
Those boy soldiers,
who haven't even reached puberty...

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:03.943
Crazy!

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.272
Ashok, what choice do we have?

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.080
You said that so easily
but what choice do we have?

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.379
Those crazy Iraqis
can come back anytime.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.921
They can blow up
our school.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.012
And what can we do?

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.382
Isn't it better that I go to Baghdad?

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.018
Talk to some people.
I know some people.

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.560
We must do something.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.023
We can't just sit here
with our hands tied.

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.769
Sir, there's a hospital up ahead.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.573
Can we stop there for a minute...

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:36.935
If you don't mind...

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:38.776
Thank you.

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.547
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.223
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:06.931
Paper.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:07.967
Paper.

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.236
Indian. Indian.

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.235
Sticker!

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:18.810
How did he get this?

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:20.404
Okay, let him go!

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.239
Open the way!

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.980
- Go! Go!
- Thank you!

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.236
Is someone at the hospital?

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:45.430
I got married 8 days ago.

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:48.473
My bride's name is Shazin.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.937
The ceremony was
to be two days later...

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.547
along with the send-off.

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:56.313
But... Saddam sent
his cavalry that night.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.047
Shazin is a nurse at the hospital.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.549
And she's been busy
at the hospital since then?

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:04.985
No, sir. She's not at the hospital...

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:07.187
nor was she at home.

01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:09.486
I've been looking for her...

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:11.423
but I haven't
found any trace of her.

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:28.646
Don't go, Ranjit. It's not safe.

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:32.951
Why don't you understand
me these days?

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:37.157
Neither of us understands the other.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:41.257
It's the circumstances
that are wrong... Not us.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:46.963
"L am going to love you so much."

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:52.970
I'm going to love
you 100 times in a moment.

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:59.642
"If you ever live me."

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:04.943
"I will only wait for death."

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:08.317
"I've forsaken the world for you."

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.591
"My breath stops on you."

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:14.161
"I love you so much."

01:04:14.618 --> 01:04:17.599
"You can never imagine."

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:20.700
"I've forsaken the world for you."

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.701
"My breath stops on you."

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.400
"I love you so much."

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:30.676
"You can never imagine."

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:37.774
Sir, we've
setup camp in a school...

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.147
You haven't tried it yet.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:40.643
Have some...

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.383
It's called Kleicha.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.984
It's considered Iraq's
national biscuit.

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:47.927
I am talking about my problem.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.191
I've heard a lot
about this boy lately.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.963
But he made only 10
runs in the first innings...

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.762
and then 27 in the second.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:56.929
I think the selectors
don't have a clue.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.504
I mean... they put anyone
in the Indian team.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.042
Look, I'm not here
for your biscuits...

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.941
nor to discuss anyone's future...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.071
on the Indian cricket team.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:09.941
We're all trapped in a
war-zone in a foreign country.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:13.419
And you are... - I am trying
to change the subject, Mr. Katiyal...

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.113
because I know what you're facing.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.783
I have no interest in hassling you.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:21.892
How would we know if...

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:25.125
everyone in your camp is Indian.

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.724
What if they turn out to
be Pakistani or Bangladeshi?

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.094
We can't issue them passports, can we?

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.804
I get it.

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:40.547
Thank you.

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:42.110
Sorry, Mr. Katiyal.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:44.541
All I can offer you is this Kleicha.

01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:47.148
Please take one.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.015
At least take one.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:56.496
Sir, anything?

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:00.534
Iraqi biscuit. Kleicha.

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:18.715
It doesn't feel like these
are the guys who just attacked Kuwait.

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:27.855
Thank you.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:29.758
What now, sir?

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.929
Do we even matter to Delhi?

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.863
We matter to ourselves.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.528
We'll have to keep trying, what else?

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.229
We can't blame Delhi either.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:40.731
There are many here...

01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:42.572
who didn't care
about Delhi until now.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.639
They thought they were Kuwaiti.

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.246
That's human nature, Ibrahim.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.280
When you're hum,
you first call out to your mother.

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.554
I'll go call Kurien.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:00.660
Yes, Kurien.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:03.992
Nothing. Kuwaitis were of no help.

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.225
Just as the Indians weren't.

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:06.999
That leaves us with just one option.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.295
I know some Iraqis.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.502
I'll try asking them for help...

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.564
to meet Saddam's
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.039
Mr. Katiyal.

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.238
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.176
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:27.147
- Would you like some tea?
- No. Thank you.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.057
- Have some.
- Thank you.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:39.166
Mr. Katiyal,
this is what I can do for you.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.332
There's a ship called Tipu Sultan...

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:43.933
coming from India.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:47.734
With 10,000 tons of food
and medical supplies for Iraq.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.742
Indians have been good...

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.207
when the whole
world was against us.

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.978
I can allow the Indians in Kuwait...

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.077
to go on their ship back home.

01:07:59.976 --> 01:08:00.852
Thank you.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:02.856
Thank you, Mr. Aziz.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.550
I really appreciate.
Thank you.

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:45.930
The Night's over... and
the morning has arrived.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.296
"Happiness has crossed all limits."

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.798
The Night's over... and
the morning has arrived.

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:53.033
"Happiness has crossed all limits."

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.608
"My heart leaps and jumps..."

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.712
"with the beat of the drums."

01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:59.644
"Today I want to..."

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.542
"Today I want to dance."

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.812
"Today I want to dance."

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.218
"Today I want to dance."

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:10.121
"Today I want to dance."

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.291
Show me that step. Show it.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.956
Hello, Mr. Ranjit.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.661
How many people can get on that ship?

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.062
I don't know.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.795
Women and children first.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.673
And then the old men, I know.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:28.638
Hold on.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:32.145
Did you take it in
writing from Tariq Aziz?

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.040
What? Ranjit?

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:39.843
You simply took his word for it?

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.889
You must do things properly.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.386
Paperwork is highly important.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.692
I don't know how you handled
such a huge company.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.043
That's good news, Mr. Katiyal.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:08.915
See you soon.

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:11.277
Papa, what else will we see in India?

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:14.748
Well there's... there's...

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.657
- You don't remember?
- No, sweetheart. Of course I do.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:22.663
But if I tell you now,
it'll ruin your surprise.

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:27.761
"Every heart's high on joy."

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:31.666
"Life Will be filled With bliss."

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:35.069
I'm going to lift my
feet and dance all night.

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:37.668
No one's going to
feel tired and sit down.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.247
We're going to shake the
earth with the thump of our feet.

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:44.845
"Its time for friends to rejoice."

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.854
"All thanks to God."

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.616
"Today I want to..."

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:51.716
"Today I want to dance."

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.886
"Today I want to dance."

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.326
"Today I want to dance."

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:59.657
"Today I want to dance."

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:15.445
- Hello.
- Mr. Katiyal.

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:17.944
Yes, Mr. Kohli.
We were just leaving.

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:21.919
There's bad news, Mr. Katiyal.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.017
UN has enforced an embargo on Iraq.

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.954
Which means... nothing
can enter or leave Iraq.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:30.861
And...

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.835
Tipu Sultan has been stopped.

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.898
Unfortunately, it won't reach you.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:47.938
It's being turned away to Dubai.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:49.706
I'm so sorry.

01:12:09.259 --> 01:12:11.796
The United Nations
has proposed the imposition...

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:14.670
of numerous sanctions
on Iraq for attacking Kuwait.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.066
The UN has refused credibility...

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:21.081
to the newly formed Kuwait
government after the attack.

01:12:21.137 --> 01:12:26.109
They refuted Iraq's claim...

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:28.220
Where are you going?

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.116
Where would I go...

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:36.197
in this pigeon coop.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:40.734
We used to have a
mansion back in Lahore.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:42.198
We used to play football...

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:45.034
and cricket in there!

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:46.902
For years you've been telling
me about a place...

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.735
where I'm never
going to be able to go.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.874
Laugh all you want, son.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:58.179
The Indians trapped in
Kuwait are faced with a dilemma.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:03.013
Those who are forced to
leave their homes in a jiffy...

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:07.659
they don't laugh.

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:14.524
Sir... Food is going to be a problem.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:15.261
What do I do?

01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:16.998
Farm the desert?

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:18.970
Why do you come to me?

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:20.234
Solve your own problems.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:22.332
Saddam hasn't made me the Emir.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:24.169
- Ranjit, what are you saying?
- What else can I do?

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.907
Give them hope, and then shatter
it again? And again!

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.605
It's not your fault.

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:30.309
And we can't even to talk
to those who are at fault.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.644
Stay here!

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:34.751
We're not going inside!

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.823
Let's just go.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:39.051
You can go. I need to talk.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.889
Talk! Talk about what?

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.122
I don't talk to Sidekicks!

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:44.597
Whom did you call a sidekick?

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:46.834
Who do you think you are?

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:49.028
You've been a trouble-maker
since you got here!

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:51.865
He didn't have anything in writing.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:55.940
He made us pack our bags.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.300
Sit in buses...

01:13:57.367 --> 01:13:58.710
and then asked us to get off.

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:00.178
Is this a joke?

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.613
He was harping about Baghdad.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.779
Where's Baghdad now?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.314
Forget it. Let's go.

01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:09.186
I won't, you go.

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:14.954
You like being a leader, don't you?

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:16.863
<i>A leader has answers.</i>

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:17.863
Do you have any?

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.526
You're a big man...

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:26.771
how would you know
what it feels like...

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.738
to have hopes shattered.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.000
Why are you standing
there quietly now?

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:34.213
Because he's a big man.

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.110
If he was petty like you...

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.243
he'd be talking
as much as you, or more.

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:41.653
What do you mean to us?

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.291
He could've left with
Simu and me days ago.

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:51.188
He still can. But he isn't.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:54.360
Instead of staying with his family...

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:57.796
he worries about you all the time.

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.196
And at a time like this...

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:02.675
he left us and went to Baghdad.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:06.313
You'd be scared to even
go to the end of the street.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.146
It's easy to point out mistakes,
Mr. George.

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:13.715
But it takes a lot to
have the courage to make mistakes.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.182
And he has that courage.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:20.924
You don't. - So who asked him...
to take on our responsibility?

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:22.256
No one did.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.026
You're right.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.128
I even warned him against it.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:27.930
But what could I do?

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:30.594
Suddenly he developed a conscience...

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:33.867
and realized he
shouldn't be selfish.

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:35.801
He should help others.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:39.206
Some people have a kind of a...
manufacturing defect.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.205
They change during tough times.

01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:42.979
He changed too.

01:15:44.107 --> 01:15:45.643
You stand here...

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.346
blaming him for everything.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.854
But you don't realise... Mr. George...

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:54.760
you're only standing
here because of him.

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.726
Because he setup this camp.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.626
Unfortunately, you'll never meet...

01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:03.431
the man that Ranjit Katiyal
was 10 days ago.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.436
Otherwise... he was an expert...

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.197
in showing a man his place.

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.740
You talk about feelings?

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.009
I saw his face when he was told...

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:15.672
that Tipu Sultan
had been turned back.

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:19.011
You feel bad for your family...

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.215
Imagine the plight of the man...

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:26.418
who was hoping to send
thousands of families back home?

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.267
Any more problems?
Should I go on?

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.362
Please, take him inside.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.282
What?

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:57.784
I've already told him...

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.690
Mr. Kohli is back
with the Kuwait issue.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:03.663
The Minister hasn't
been answering the phone since.

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:06.028
It looks like he won't go home today.

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:07.998
I just need to talk to him.

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:13.396
I don't get it.
You're not even in the Gulf Division.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:18.612
Everyone else is preparing
to leave for the Malaysia conference.

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.938
And you're sitting here.

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:24.318
Lata, those people are in trouble.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.820
There's a guy who calls me everyday.

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.614
What do I say to him?

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:35.828
I told you that the
Minister will support the PWD.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:38.228
Please sit, don't worry.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:41.668
Yes, sir.

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:43.226
Has Kohli left or is he still there?

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.968
- I think he's gone.
- Good riddance.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.303
- You come in.
- Here I am, sir.

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:53.875
Sorry, sir.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.946
I knocked,
but you were on the intercom.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:00.249
Kohli, stop acting like
you're scared of me. - Sir.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.687
Kuwait is not our priority.

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:04.816
Sir, I have only one request.

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:08.988
You know our government is not stable.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:11.827
There's no guarantee
how long we'll stay in power.

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.164
- Of course not sir..
- But you bureaucrats...

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:16.429
are here until your retirement.

01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:19.837
And something will happen
only if you want it to.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:22.675
You're right, sir.

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:26.705
I've been waiting for
four hours to say exactly this.

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:28.711
It's been four hours?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.784
Fine...

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.713
you guys handle it.

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:45.861
Hello.

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:48.668
Yes, hold on Kurien.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.068
Ranjit, it's Kurien.

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:57.801
Hello. Yes.

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:02.882
Fine. That's good.

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:04.009
Fine.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:04.949
What happened?

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:06.680
They're running out
of food in the camp.

01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:07.786
So what are they doing?

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:10.380
Kurien sent Ibrahim to the docks.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.915
There's some holding shed...

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:14.188
where they used to buy
stuff for the supermarket.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.294
He saw some activity there.

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:18.865
- Now?
- So Kurien's going there.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.500
He might find something.

01:19:20.723 --> 01:19:21.963
Shouldn't you be going?

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:25.368
Why? Are you feeling
like yelling at George again?

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.273
I go there, return empty handed...

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.479
George blames me,
and you yell at him.

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:34.271
And we get entertained in Kuwait.

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:39.015
Come on, Ranjit.

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.081
Ranjit.

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:45.119
You're a negotiator, baby.

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.754
They can't get what you can.

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:51.492
What if I fail?

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:54.459
You won't.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:56.759
You won't.

01:19:58.027 --> 01:19:59.267
Its not in your DNA.

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:14.387
It's definitely not a supply ship.

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:16.914
Seems like they're
preparing to leave though.

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:18.314
Let's go take a look.

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.760
Excuse me... are you Indian?

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:34.103
Yes. Why?

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:37.801
No... ls this ship going anywhere?

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:43.012
Yes... is there a problem?

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:46.277
No, I... Are they letting you out?

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:48.117
We're taking garbage.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:50.687
Garbage?

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:54.250
Hey fatso... Come here.

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:59.825
Who cares about
garbage in the middle of a war?

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.796
I do. I am the captain of this ship.

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:04.735
Our company has a contract for this.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.804
Anything else?

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:09.099
Captain, how many people
can get on this ship?

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:12.010
Around 500.

01:21:12.134 --> 01:21:13.875
But don't even think about it.

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.472
Can you think about it if I pay you?

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.087
Hey... Leave.

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:29.887
Quickly. Double-march.

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:35.024
I can.

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:38.534
- But not a single Kuwaiti.
- Of course.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:40.732
How much for a single person.

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:45.006
- 5000 dollar.
- Hey...

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:48.141
Who pays 5000 dollars for garbage?

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:51.011
I can dump garbage in
the middle of the sea.

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:52.515
Not you.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:57.852
- Who do I have to take?
- What do you care about names?

01:21:58.347 --> 01:21:59.826
I can pay you 200 dollars per person.

01:22:03.819 --> 01:22:06.231
Why would I risk
my life for 200 dollars?

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:08.097
You can for 100,000 dollars?

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.468
200 dollars per person. 500 people

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.562
100,000 dollars.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.906
It's a two hours journey
The money will be all yours.

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:19.969
Let's go, Kurien.

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:22.380
Now what?

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:24.384
Don't look back,
keep walking straight.

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:26.317
- Look straight...
- Wait a minute.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:27.250
Fine.

01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:31.322
But they won't be my responsibility.

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:32.515
Okay?

01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:35.392
Get the money and
the people at midnight.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.929
But not a single Kuwaiti.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.768
Poonawala.

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.840
The Sheikhs are having a meeting.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.012
They didn't invite us.

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:56.306
Wherever the ship takes you...

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:59.842
you call Red Cross
and claim refugee status.

01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:01.986
I've spoken to the captain.

01:23:02.111 --> 01:23:04.990
It will be 200 dollars per person.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.824
You can all afford it.

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.892
I personally feel,
it's a risk worth taking.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.761
This is the army tank,
these are guns and this is the Police.

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.870
Baby, why?

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:21.072
Amrita, Simmu isn't ready yey?

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:22.865
You haven't packed either.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.839
Why pack when we
aren't going anywhere?

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:26.974
Papa, give me my book.

01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:28.070
Give it back.

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:33.715
Don't be childish.

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:35.288
I think you've forgotten Punjabi.

01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:38.019
<i>"I'll</i> go wherever my husband goes."

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.193
Don't force me, Ranjit.

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.727
I'm not going anywhere without you.

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:45.360
And like you said...

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:48.065
Our fate is entwined
with the fate of the others.

01:23:54.163 --> 01:23:56.302
Why don't you just admit
that your real problem is the garbage.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.318
Hello.

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.819
Sanjeev Kohli, Mr. Katiyal.

01:24:08.944 --> 01:24:10.446
You've called after quite a while.

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:12.220
Where were you all these days?

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:15.258
Well... l couldn't figure anything out.

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:18.398
But now we're talking to Jordan...

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.265
to let the Indians in Amman.

01:24:21.323 --> 01:24:22.267
Amman?

01:24:23.025 --> 01:24:25.232
Amman is 1000 kilometers from here.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.203
And we'll have to go through Iraq.

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:29.500
Kohli sir, you can say it so easily.

01:24:29.832 --> 01:24:31.106
But how will we get there?

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:34.406
You see... this is
the only option we have.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.083
And even that is not confirmed.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.483
Then confirm it.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:42.245
Because we can't stay here for long,
and that's confirmed.

01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:43.781
Another thing Kohli sir.

01:24:43.879 --> 01:24:46.291
I'm sending 500 people
on a ship from here.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:49.462
Please... try to get them asylum.

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:51.058
I'll give you the details.

01:24:51.153 --> 01:24:52.393
And don't just stop there.

01:24:52.788 --> 01:24:54.131
There are still 150,000 left here.

01:25:00.062 --> 01:25:05.102
- Sir... how will we go with them...
- You go with Kurien.

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:07.340
Kurien, look after them.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.213
Don't worry.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:10.242
Come.

01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:18.291
Ranjit.

01:25:20.049 --> 01:25:23.292
- Thank you, buddy.
- Good luck.

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:24.958
Look after everyone.

01:25:26.255 --> 01:25:30.203
Ranjit. What did you say?

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.264
First women and children
and then old men.

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:35.971
But here only the rich are going.

01:25:36.031 --> 01:25:37.772
This is really, really unfair Mr.
Katiyal.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.846
Just because we can't give
the money... - Mr. Poonawala...

01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:41.210
l know you don't have money.

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.807
And all the people with
you don't have money either.

01:25:43.906 --> 01:25:45.852
I do... but I am not going.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.288
There's no point in getting
jealous of those who are going.

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:52.154
- And anyway, they're paying a price.
- And us?

01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:55.387
- Should we look out for ourselves?
- I didn't say that.

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:57.660
I am still here with you.

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:01.326
- Joseph, take the bus.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:03.328
- Look, Mr. Ranjit.
- Hey..

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.670
Enough... in one moment

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:10.009
I'll prove Amrita wrong...

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:12.078
and go back to
being the old Ranjit...

01:26:12.134 --> 01:26:14.011
which none of you will like.

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:18.682
I am doing whatever I can.

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:21.116
Don't ask for more.

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:37.326
Heads down. Heads down.

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:58.848
Give me. - Yeah take.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:04.321
Come on Simu.

01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:15.905
Spicy Indian food and whiskey.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:20.313
I know you're a man of your words.

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:25.217
Then... why are you cheating?

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.411
Cheating?

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:33.459
You said... l am the Emir now.

01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:36.960
Wouldn't I know that...

01:27:37.019 --> 01:27:40.796
you're illegally
sending 500 Indians out?

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.808
They can still go...

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:54.505
Just pay the price to the Amir.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.550
I've already have.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.215
2 bottles of whiskey and this.

01:28:06.849 --> 01:28:09.261
I want 100,000 dollars.

01:28:09.551 --> 01:28:11.121
I said I was wrong.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:14.028
You're not the Emir.

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:19.904
If you were the Emir...

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.339
then you would've know about
the deal I made in Baghdad.

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:23.873
What deal?

01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:26.472
Talk to the External Minister.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.839
Everyone knows...
if the US intervenes...

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:31.510
lraq will no longer have Kuwait.

01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:34.847
But they will definitely
have the riches looted from Iraq.

01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:38.889
All that money
goes to the <i>Swiss</i> Bank.

01:28:39.581 --> 01:28:42.960
And your government
has asked me to do this for them.

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:47.991
Call Baghdad and let the bus go.

01:28:48.257 --> 01:28:51.170
Otherwise your President
Mr Saddam Hussien will

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.432
hang you like he did Fawad...

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.640
I want 100,000 dollars right now.

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.853
May I please speak to Mr Tariq Aziz

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.859
- this is Ranjit Katiyal speaking.
- Mr. Ranjit.

01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:17.693
Please, stop.

01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:20.297
This is not necessary.

01:29:20.622 --> 01:29:22.101
Please, finish dinner.

01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:25.898
I insist Major, please.

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:38.343
Ranjit,
you never told me about the deal.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.914
There was no deal.

01:29:41.076 --> 01:29:42.987
Did you...

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.690
I had no other option.

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:46.382
What if he cross-checks?

01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:49.186
No one can risk
cross-checking with Saddam.

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:51.397
But that Major...

01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:53.391
He'll definitely do something.

01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:55.195
I was just thinking that

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:57.370
I hope I didn't risk
the lives of 150,000..

01:29:57.659 --> 01:29:59.104
in order to save 500.

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:14.579
Hello. - Mr. Katiyal, at this hour?

01:30:14.710 --> 01:30:15.950
Mr. Kohli, I am leaving
for Jordan in the morning...

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:17.217
along with my people.

01:30:17.279 --> 01:30:17.950
Jordan?

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.657
What happened?

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:22.293
I never trusted the Iraqi army.

01:30:22.451 --> 01:30:23.930
The situation here is getting worse.

01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:26.363
But you can't go to Jordan just yet.

01:30:26.488 --> 01:30:28.934
Look... we just started
negotiating with them...

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:31.436
and they haven't
made a decision yet.

01:30:31.493 --> 01:30:33.439
Then get a decision taken, Mr. Kohli.

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:34.902
We don't have an option.

01:30:34.997 --> 01:30:37.807
Trying to get there with
so many people is dangerous.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:40.504
Staying is
Kuwait is even more dangerous.

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:42.372
Give me a few days.

01:30:42.971 --> 01:30:45.611
I'm talking to the
Civil Aviation ministry...

01:30:45.707 --> 01:30:47.687
Mr. Kohli, please hurry up.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:50.253
Get the Jordan border to open for us.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:51.651
Because we're leaving.

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:53.490
Goodnight.

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:08.703
Hello.

01:31:09.364 --> 01:31:11.366
Can I talk to Amrit Pal?

01:31:12.534 --> 01:31:14.639
I know it's late,
but it's very urgent.

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.941
This is Kuwait and this is Jordan.

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:21.817
The distance from here
to here is 1091 kilometers.

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:24.423
And for that I need all your help.

01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:25.923
Take as many men as you can.

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:33.925
Ahmed.

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:09.165
- Why can't I come?
- Why don't you understand?

01:32:09.224 --> 01:32:11.500
We're doing this for a reason.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.971
Mr. Poonawala, you get on that bus.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:14.803
Meher, go with your dad.

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:16.934
Joseph, tell everyone...

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:19.672
that everyone leaves in
groups of 3-4 vehicles. - Okay.

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.236
- And we all meet at Jahra border.
- Okay.

01:32:21.303 --> 01:32:22.873
- And from there we go together.
- Okay, sir.

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.883
Did you make sure some young men

01:32:25.941 --> 01:32:27.579
- are in each vehicle.
- Yes... l did.

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:28.586
Okay.

01:32:28.844 --> 01:32:30.050
Where's Ibrahim.

01:32:30.145 --> 01:32:31.624
Sir, I don't know.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:33.187
OK don't worry about it.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:46.537
So now you're making
a fuss instead of George.

01:32:50.032 --> 01:32:51.272
Sir, I won't go.

01:32:52.701 --> 01:32:54.271
Not without Shazin.

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.740
It's not right for me to go.

01:32:56.872 --> 01:32:58.943
I'll stay here, and look for her.

01:32:59.207 --> 01:33:02.347
If you want to find
her then move ahead.

01:33:03.345 --> 01:33:05.325
By staying here you're proving...

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.954
that you've lost
all hope to see her.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.029
Try to look for her where
all Indians are going.

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:12.689
Maybe...

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.372
Good thing we are going from here.

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:30.872
God knows what it will be like there.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.647
Whatever it is,
it will be better than here.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.991
- What did she say?
- What?

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:44.128
She's your sponsor, right?

01:33:44.386 --> 01:33:45.956
- Sponsor...
- She's a Kuwaiti?

01:33:46.822 --> 01:33:48.358
You worked for her, didn't you?

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:49.193
No, sir...

01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:50.836
Why are you getting involved?

01:33:51.093 --> 01:33:53.937
He's the kid, not me.

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:55.733
She spoke in Arabic.

01:33:56.031 --> 01:33:57.601
You're a Kuwaiti, aren't you?

01:33:57.666 --> 01:33:58.736
I'm telling you...

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.073
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:02.080
George sir.

01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:03.207
Where are you going?

01:34:05.173 --> 01:34:06.811
Why did you get off the bus now?

01:34:06.908 --> 01:34:08.216
You need me to get something
in writing from Saddam?

01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:11.284
You weren't able to,
but I found out.

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.757
A time-bomb is ticking
in the bus. - What?

01:34:14.082 --> 01:34:17.063
The woman traveling with Preethi,
she's a Kuwaiti.

01:34:17.619 --> 01:34:19.758
- I know that.
- You know.

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:23.028
And yet you let her stay in the camp.

01:34:23.258 --> 01:34:24.896
If the Iraqi army
would have found out...

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.769
they would've cut
us all to pieces that day.

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:28.398
They didn't find out,
you're still alive, aren't you?

01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:29.370
Let's go.

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:31.308
Is this a joke, Mr. Ranjit?

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:35.314
If the Iraqi army finds out...

01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:39.318
that we're taking
a Kuwaiti in our bus...

01:34:39.708 --> 01:34:41.779
then our lives will be in danger.

01:34:42.444 --> 01:34:44.720
Leave a woman and
a child behind to die...

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.856
only because she's a Kuwaiti?

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:51.160
I can't do that, George.

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.021
What?

01:34:53.388 --> 01:34:56.665
That Kuwaiti life
is important to you..

01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:59.031
not ours?

01:34:59.928 --> 01:35:02.465
You have no right to do this.

01:35:02.998 --> 01:35:04.136
This is wrong.

01:35:10.272 --> 01:35:11.342
Ranjit.

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:17.216
- Ask her to come out.
- Sir.

01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:20.156
- Tell her to come out.
- Sir, where will she go?

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.694
You come out first.

01:35:22.117 --> 01:35:22.993
Come out.

01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:24.352
Come out.

01:35:25.587 --> 01:35:26.793
Give me the kid.

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:29.861
Sir. - Come.

01:35:29.925 --> 01:35:32.269
- Sir, please.
- Come.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.033
- Sir...
- Come on.

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:36.732
- Sir.
- Let's go.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.678
Come on.

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:45.784
Get down.

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:54.048
Do I have the right to risk my life...

01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:57.192
Or should I get that in writing too?

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:01.632
Get into the bus.

01:36:17.172 --> 01:36:20.085
She's Tasneem.
She'll be going with us to Amman.

01:36:20.241 --> 01:36:21.413
She's a Kuwaiti.

01:36:22.644 --> 01:36:24.248
You can come with us, in our car.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:30.753
"The desire of my eyes..."

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:36.668
"is to keep staring at your face."

01:36:37.392 --> 01:36:42.364
"My slumbers are filled..."

01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:47.774
"with only your dreams."

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:51.117
"They all lead me to you..."

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:53.982
"all the paths in the world."

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:57.021
"I love you so much."

01:36:57.178 --> 01:37:01.058
"You cannot imagine."

01:38:29.938 --> 01:38:33.078
Go meet Mr. Tripathi, okay.

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.316
Kohli, we've forwarded the proposal.

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:37.219
And we're talking
to the Air-Force chief.

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:38.518
We'll have to Airlift them.

01:38:38.947 --> 01:38:41.553
But sir, 170,000 people
in Air-Force planes?

01:38:42.884 --> 01:38:45.421
- I know it's not possible.
- So then?

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.431
The Air India Chief has
been summoned in the morning.

01:38:50.225 --> 01:38:52.205
Air India planes can do it,
can't they?

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:54.872
But, sir... civilian
aircraft in a war zone?

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:56.133
That's crazy.

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.579
Two dates.

01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:07.920
Are we breaking a
fast or eating a meal?

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.453
I'll take it if he doesn't want it.

01:39:12.847 --> 01:39:13.484
Here you go.

01:39:13.815 --> 01:39:15.852
No, mom, no dates.
Something else.

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.058
Baby, eat this now.

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:20.224
We'll eat 'jalebis'
when we get to India, okay.

01:39:20.488 --> 01:39:21.523
Good girl.

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:29.206
You must help us with the evacuation.

01:39:29.464 --> 01:39:33.037
We're commercial pilots, sir.
Not the Indian Air Force.

01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:35.172
Look, we already had a
word with the Air India chief.

01:39:35.237 --> 01:39:35.977
So?

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:37.977
We have to fly planes
Into a war zone, not him.

01:39:38.173 --> 01:39:38.913
Yes.

01:39:39.007 --> 01:39:41.248
And if we wanted to risk our lives...

01:39:41.409 --> 01:39:43.218
then we would've
joined the Air Force.

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.448
Why don't you volunteer
to fly the plane?

01:39:45.814 --> 01:39:46.884
Sir, can I talk to them.

01:39:53.121 --> 01:39:55.328
Look, there's no
question of forcing you.

01:39:56.524 --> 01:39:58.333
It's your choice
whether you go or not.

01:39:58.626 --> 01:40:02.164
But 175,000 people are
waiting for us in Jordan.

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:05.070
And their only fault is...

01:40:05.133 --> 01:40:07.306
that they're Indians,
but not our kin.

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.174
I can't give you a reason...

01:40:11.272 --> 01:40:12.945
to risk your lives for them.

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:17.046
It's best that you
find one yourselves...

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.488
that would save their lives.

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:42.937
Meher.

01:40:45.806 --> 01:40:47.786
I've seen so much news.

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:52.114
But never thought that someday
we'll be the news.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.323
Indian Refugees in
Kuwait Because of Iraq.

01:40:58.319 --> 01:41:00.663
It's so confusing, isn't it?

01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:10.200
Oh yes...

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:13.310
The Minister was asking...

01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:15.080
who's going to pay for all this?

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.678
I think the Finance Ministry
will have to jump in.

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:23.950
Will you talk to them or should I?

01:41:24.145 --> 01:41:25.215
You do it, sir.

01:41:25.713 --> 01:41:26.783
You see, they have no documents...

01:41:26.848 --> 01:41:29.795
so I'll try and get
temporary passports issued.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:57.812
Ranjit.

01:41:58.279 --> 01:41:59.257
Ranjit.

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.431
Don't get out of the car?

01:42:12.694 --> 01:42:13.672
Officer, Indian.

01:42:13.728 --> 01:42:16.140
Indian.
We all Indian.

01:42:16.731 --> 01:42:18.301
We got permission
from President Saddam...

01:42:18.366 --> 01:42:19.902
- Papers...
- To go to Jordan.

01:42:20.068 --> 01:42:20.842
Passport.

01:42:20.902 --> 01:42:21.972
Show me the passport.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.309
Don't try to ruin things now.

01:42:24.372 --> 01:42:25.442
Get back.

01:42:25.673 --> 01:42:26.310
Show me the passport

01:42:26.374 --> 01:42:27.478
I don't have passport No passport.

01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:28.710
- But we assure you...
- Kuwaiti.

01:42:28.776 --> 01:42:30.153
Kuwaiti. Kuwaiti.

01:42:30.211 --> 01:42:31.485
- Kuwaiti.
- No, no, no... we're not Kuwaiti.

01:42:31.846 --> 01:42:32.756
Stop it.

01:42:32.814 --> 01:42:35.693
- Passport Passport.
- Stay inside, Amrita.

01:42:40.955 --> 01:42:42.866
Indian. We're Indians, sir.

01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:46.233
Two more people.

01:42:46.294 --> 01:42:47.705
- I want two more passports.
- No, no, no.

01:42:47.795 --> 01:42:49.433
They are all Indians.
We don't have passports.

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:50.708
- Kuwaiti?
- No, no, no...

01:42:50.765 --> 01:42:51.800
No, Indian.

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:52.707
Kuwaiti...

01:42:52.767 --> 01:42:55.145
- We're Indian. Indian. Kuwaiti.
- No, Indian.

01:42:55.303 --> 01:42:57.715
Indian. Indian.

01:42:57.772 --> 01:43:02.812
- Dollar. Money.
- You take your money, I take your wife.

01:43:03.244 --> 01:43:05.520
She's a Kuwaiti.
Let my boys have some fun.

01:43:52.994 --> 01:43:54.098
Ranjit.

01:43:54.562 --> 01:43:56.542
Stop it. Leave me.

01:43:56.965 --> 01:43:57.909
Ranjit.

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.043
Ranjit.

01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:00.945
Ranjit.

01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:03.346
Help!

01:44:06.107 --> 01:44:07.450
Please, no...

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:11.546
Please, don't.
Please.

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:40.944
Drop your gun... and you all can live.

01:45:15.443 --> 01:45:17.980
No, no, no... it can't be
done at your level, Mr. Kohli.

01:45:18.112 --> 01:45:20.752
Why are you arguing, Mr. Chapekar?

01:45:21.349 --> 01:45:24.421
I told you that the Minister
from Kuwait division...

01:45:24.485 --> 01:45:27.261
Mr. Kohli, without confirming
at the secretary level...

01:45:27.355 --> 01:45:30.495
<i>at</i> the Amman embassy,
we can't issue temporary passports.

01:45:30.725 --> 01:45:31.726
Please try and understand.

01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:32.964
Let people come in...

01:45:33.027 --> 01:45:36.201
and I'll ask the Minister himself
to speak to you.

01:45:56.417 --> 01:45:57.794
What now?

01:45:57.952 --> 01:45:59.158
Will he open the gate?

01:46:10.798 --> 01:46:11.936
Well done Kohli.

01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:03.124
Sir...

01:47:03.751 --> 01:47:04.821
Sir, what now?

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:05.963
Where are the others?

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:07.931
Some got down with Joseph.

01:47:08.022 --> 01:47:09.831
And the rest are sitting on the buses.

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:13.304
Excuse me. Mr. Katiyal.

01:47:13.361 --> 01:47:15.637
- One question.
- Not now.

01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:17.400
Mr. Poonawala,
please go sit in the bus.

01:47:17.632 --> 01:47:19.202
- Not now.
- Ranjit.

01:47:19.767 --> 01:47:20.905
There are flags from all countries...

01:47:21.102 --> 01:47:22.740
but where's the Indian flag?

01:47:24.005 --> 01:47:26.383
- Do one thing, take her.
- Yes.

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:28.878
- Hold my hand, Simu.
- Move.

01:47:38.853 --> 01:47:41.060
Mr. Kohli, I could've
insisted for written orders...

01:47:41.122 --> 01:47:42.066
But I am not.

01:47:43.224 --> 01:47:44.328
Please hold on.

01:47:44.859 --> 01:47:45.633
Hello.

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:46.804
Yes, Mohan.

01:47:47.195 --> 01:47:48.003
Huh?

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:50.738
- They're at the airport.
- They've already arrived...

01:47:50.798 --> 01:47:52.368
and you're still
stuck in red tape.

01:47:52.667 --> 01:47:54.669
Mr. Kohli.
Will you please keep quiet?

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:55.746
Please.!

01:47:55.803 --> 01:47:56.713
Hello...

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.374
Yeah, I'll do something.

01:47:58.706 --> 01:48:00.083
Give me sometime, I'll do something.

01:48:00.908 --> 01:48:04.014
Chapekar sir... they are our people.

01:48:04.712 --> 01:48:06.783
They've already suffered a lot.

01:48:07.014 --> 01:48:08.425
Please don't make
them suffer any more...

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:10.151
by waiting for orders.

01:48:10.284 --> 01:48:11.319
Please.

01:48:12.086 --> 01:48:12.894
Excuse me.

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:13.998
Excuse me.

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:18.363
We're around 170,000 Indians...

01:48:18.426 --> 01:48:19.734
who've come from Kuwait.

01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:21.898
And we've no clue what to do.

01:48:22.096 --> 01:48:24.337
Look, all the people
standing outside...

01:48:24.465 --> 01:48:26.411
are waiting for
the same information.

01:48:26.767 --> 01:48:27.768
You have to wait too, please.

01:48:27.835 --> 01:48:29.143
Saddam has barged into our homes...

01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:30.715
and you're asking us to wait.

01:48:31.172 --> 01:48:34.119
Look... no point in getting heated up.

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:36.716
I really don't know anything.

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:37.719
Please.

01:48:41.749 --> 01:48:42.489
Hello.

01:48:42.717 --> 01:48:43.787
Yes, from Delhi.

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:44.994
Yes.

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.721
Yes, sir.

01:48:46.787 --> 01:48:47.857
Okay, sir.

01:48:47.955 --> 01:48:50.492
Okay, sir.
Thank you.

01:49:15.983 --> 01:49:20.983
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

01:49:29.697 --> 01:49:34.544
"You kept living on..."

01:49:35.102 --> 01:49:41.542
"and he kept dying for you."

01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:48.552
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

01:49:49.116 --> 01:49:55.499
he came to your rescue,
leaving everything behind.

01:49:55.623 --> 01:50:01.733
"With happiness in your path."

01:50:02.663 --> 01:50:08.670
"He's with you at every turn."

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:14.783
"Leaving everything behind."

01:50:17.111 --> 01:50:21.787
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

01:50:22.650 --> 01:50:28.498
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:51:00.654 --> 01:51:01.189
Next.

01:51:01.522 --> 01:51:02.592
Behram Poonawala.

01:51:06.227 --> 01:51:07.035
Yes, next.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.106
- Meher Poonawala.
- Daljit Singh.

01:51:13.501 --> 01:51:14.138
Next.

01:51:14.702 --> 01:51:15.874
Your name?

01:51:17.238 --> 01:51:18.308
Ma'am, what's your name?

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:19.748
Shazin.

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.050
Shazin what?

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:22.753

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:25.286

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:26.915

01:51:30.084 --> 01:51:36.330
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:51:36.891 --> 01:51:43.172
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

01:51:43.697 --> 01:51:50.080
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:51:50.337 --> 01:51:56.049
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

01:51:56.276 --> 01:52:01.276
"The tears that were..."

01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:12.662
"With happiness in your path."

01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:15.100
How did you decide the seating?

01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:17.768
Meaning, who sits in first class...

01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:19.071
and who sits in economy?

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:20.370
Well, I'll just check on that, sir.

01:52:20.734 --> 01:52:21.303
Excuse me.

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:23.946
Otherwise it's very unfair.

01:52:25.573 --> 01:52:26.347
Kohli.

01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:29.679
Congratulations.

01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:31.683
The first flight's about to take-off.

01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:47.762
"Vande Mataram!"

01:52:49.797 --> 01:52:53.677
"Vande Mataram!"

01:52:53.868 --> 01:52:55.711
The World's biggest rescue operation.

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:57.472
Air India, Indian Airlines...

01:52:57.538 --> 01:53:00.883
and Indian Air Force
pilots flew 488 such flights.

01:53:01.142 --> 01:53:04.385
The world has never witnessed nor will
probably ever witness...

01:53:04.445 --> 01:53:07.016
a rescue operation of this scale:

01:53:07.515 --> 01:53:09.927
India brought home, over a 100,000 of
her citizens

01:53:10.384 --> 01:53:11.658
who were stuck in another country.

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:15.427
And we've brought our
people back safe and sound.

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:20.798
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:27.408
Those we never met, and never
got the chance to meet later...

01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:30.709
Many government officers
like Sanjeev Kohli...

01:53:30.871 --> 01:53:32.145
made this possible.

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.017
Birdy flew.

01:53:35.776 --> 01:53:36.982
Plane flew.

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:39.889
- Simu flew.
- No.

01:53:39.947 --> 01:53:40.982
Mom flew.

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:43.528
I flew.
How can I fly?

01:53:57.097 --> 01:54:02.012
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:05.143
Even today I get upset
over some problems in India.

01:54:05.606 --> 01:54:06.812
I am still cynical.

01:54:06.907 --> 01:54:09.251
But after boarding that last flight...

01:54:09.643 --> 01:54:13.056
l have never asked, what
has my country done for me.

01:54:45.279 --> 01:54:50.279
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

01:54:58.792 --> 01:55:03.400
"You kept living on..."

01:55:04.398 --> 01:55:10.542
"and he kept dying for you."

01:55:11.205 --> 01:55:17.645
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

01:55:18.345 --> 01:55:24.387
he came to your rescue,
leaving everything behind.

01:55:24.652 --> 01:55:30.762
"With happiness in your path."

01:55:31.625 --> 01:55:37.769
"He's with you at every turn."

01:55:38.265 --> 01:55:42.805
"Leaving everything behind."

01:55:46.373 --> 01:55:51.373
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

01:56:59.246 --> 01:57:04.924
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:12.494
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

01:57:12.726 --> 01:57:19.075
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:57:19.533 --> 01:57:25.074
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

01:57:25.372 --> 01:57:30.372
"The tears that were..."

01:57:38.685 --> 01:57:44.795
"With happiness in your path."

01:57:45.759 --> 01:57:52.005
"He's with you at every turn."

01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:56.741
"Leaving everything behind."

01:58:00.374 --> 01:58:05.374
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:47.626
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:58:47.788 --> 01:58:54.364
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

01:58:54.494 --> 01:59:01.002
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

01:59:01.368 --> 01:59:07.148
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

01:59:07.374 --> 01:59:12.374
"The tears that were..."

01:59:20.487 --> 01:59:27.496
"With happiness in your path."

01:59:27.561 --> 01:59:33.807
"He's with you at every turn."

01:59:33.867 --> 01:59:37.542
"Leaving everything behind."

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:59.132
"Vande Mataram!"

02:00:00.727 --> 02:00:07.474
"Vande Mataram!"

02:00:07.534 --> 02:00:14.110
"Vande Mataram!"

02:00:14.174 --> 02:00:21.524
"Vande Mataram!"

02:00:22.305 --> 02:00:28.591
