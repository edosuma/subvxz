WEBVTT

00:02.423 --> 00:05.381
You've told me how little
you know about her.

00:05.383 --> 00:07.941
A Jew who lived through the war
in Europe.

00:07.943 --> 00:10.261
Who knows what lengths
she went to to survive?

00:10.263 --> 00:12.421
I don't care what it costs.

00:12.423 --> 00:15.101
Find something
that will rid us of her forever.

00:15.103 --> 00:16.661
You must not hurt our baby.

00:16.663 --> 00:18.461
It's taking a life, it's a sin.

00:18.463 --> 00:20.461
I couldn't be with you
if you did that, ever.

00:20.463 --> 00:22.621
The baby's gone.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.381
What if he doesn't believe me?

00:24.383 --> 00:26.141
He'll think
you've had an abortion?

00:26.143 --> 00:28.221
Can I kiss you?

00:28.223 --> 00:31.041
I'm gonna seek
professional help while I'm
there.

00:31.043 --> 00:32.741
There are doctors
for that sort of thing.

00:32.743 --> 00:35.821
I'll get it out of me,
even if he has to cut it out.

00:35.823 --> 00:38.403
What's it worth to you
for the world not to find out

00:38.448 --> 00:39.968
that your son's a queer?

00:40.928 --> 00:43.246
I reckon a thousand quid
should be about right.

00:43.248 --> 00:44.766
He's been seen
with Harry Polson!

00:44.768 --> 00:47.448
Oh, God.
We're being blackmailed!

02:25.667 --> 02:28.507
Why would I dream
he was making love to Olivia,

02:29.007 --> 02:31.407
and see her so abandoned,

02:31.678 --> 02:33.916
when I'm the one who...

02:33.918 --> 02:35.636
Yes?

02:35.638 --> 02:37.796
I'm the one who...

02:37.798 --> 02:40.156
desires Harry.

02:40.158 --> 02:42.356
Why make it Olivia in my dream?

02:42.358 --> 02:45.316
You saw her
as she would see you -

02:45.318 --> 02:47.316
a wanton betrayer.

02:47.318 --> 02:50.116
How'd it make you feel?

02:50.118 --> 02:52.036
Sick to my stomach.

02:52.038 --> 02:54.038
Any other feeling?

02:58.158 --> 03:00.676
I was envious.
Why?

03:00.678 --> 03:03.076
That I wasn't in her place.

03:03.078 --> 03:04.838
Thank you.

03:08.718 --> 03:10.598
I want you to cure me.

03:13.438 --> 03:14.956
It won't be pleasant.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.996
Being like this isn't pleasant.

03:16.998 --> 03:19.836
I will need your total
commitment.

03:19.838 --> 03:22.318
You have it.

03:26.278 --> 03:28.396
They told me
you'd be back soon.

03:28.398 --> 03:30.396
And here I am.

03:30.398 --> 03:33.596
You've no doubt seen me pop in
from time to time to offer

03:33.598 --> 03:36.636
pastoral care to patients
less fortunate than some.

03:36.638 --> 03:37.636
Yes.

03:37.638 --> 03:39.116
I was wondering

03:39.118 --> 03:42.116
if some of your house patients
may also benefit.

03:42.118 --> 03:44.356
I'll, um... I'll give it
some thought.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.916
'Cause I'd be delighted.

03:45.918 --> 03:47.398
Miss Adams?

03:48.398 --> 03:52.436
Is that a ring I'm seeing,
third finger, left hand?

03:52.438 --> 03:54.836
Yes, it's a ring.

03:54.838 --> 03:56.716
Did a little birdie tell me

03:56.718 --> 03:59.556
it might have something
to do with Mr Bligh?

03:59.558 --> 04:03.276
Well, I'm not sure exactly
what the little birdie said...

04:03.278 --> 04:05.996
but it is from Mr Bligh.

04:05.998 --> 04:08.998
And I'm sure you'll be invited
to the wedding.

04:15.078 --> 04:16.555
Still under?

04:16.558 --> 04:18.356
Yeah, it was a strong draught.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.676
You're staying?

04:20.678 --> 04:24.156
Yeah, I want to make sure of
her state of mind when she
wakes.

04:24.158 --> 04:26.036
You've no idea what caused it?

04:26.038 --> 04:29.156
Some sort of argument
with George.

04:29.158 --> 04:31.116
About Sarah?

04:31.118 --> 04:32.998
I'm not sure.

04:34.278 --> 04:36.596
She kept mentioning James.

04:36.598 --> 04:38.718
I don't know.

04:43.278 --> 04:46.236
Might I have time
to pop into town briefly?

04:46.238 --> 04:48.676
Yeah. Be a good hour.

04:48.678 --> 04:50.798
Plenty of time, then.

05:01.318 --> 05:03.716
I predicted it,
did I not, Alma, dear?

05:03.718 --> 05:05.836
I saw Cupid flying
through the air.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.156
I knew those arrows
would hit their mark.

05:08.158 --> 05:10.316
Of course, they're from
very different worlds.

05:10.318 --> 05:12.516
Goodness knows
what they're going to do

05:12.518 --> 05:15.916
about her being a daughter of
Abraham, but love conquers all.

05:15.918 --> 05:19.076
Did I mention she's already
invited me to the wedding?

05:19.078 --> 05:20.558
Yes, Doris.

05:28.598 --> 05:30.436
I have to put these
in Dr Duncan's office.

05:30.438 --> 05:31.916
Indeed, Alma, indeed.

05:31.918 --> 05:33.996
Duty calls.

05:33.998 --> 05:36.676
Of course,
it's rather a good thing

05:36.678 --> 05:39.716
that Miss Adams is getting
beyond the age for kiddies.

05:39.718 --> 05:41.476
The wee one would be torn

05:41.478 --> 05:43.358
between Christian pillar
and Jewish post.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.596
And the wedding itself
may present a little dilemma.

05:56.598 --> 05:59.276
I suspect they may go
for a quiet civil affair,

05:59.278 --> 06:02.236
unless they have two,
one for him and one for her.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.518
But that seems a little
excessive, don't you think?

06:06.438 --> 06:08.716
Excuse me.

06:08.718 --> 06:10.438
Maude!

06:15.678 --> 06:17.278
Sister.

06:18.558 --> 06:20.676
When you hear I'm gone,

06:20.678 --> 06:22.876
don't take solace in the fact.

06:22.878 --> 06:26.596
There's many a slip
twixt the cup and the altar.

06:26.598 --> 06:28.598
Shalom.

06:47.398 --> 06:49.916
He wants to start straightaway.

06:49.918 --> 06:52.798
He's confident he can help.
That's wonderful.

06:54.638 --> 06:57.556
It might not be pleasant.
In what way?

06:57.558 --> 07:00.396
Oh, he said he'll explain
when I'm admitted.

07:00.398 --> 07:02.636
Requires a stay
in an institution.

07:02.638 --> 07:05.036
A MENTAL institution?
It's a mental condition.

07:05.038 --> 07:07.116
But...
I trust him.

07:07.118 --> 07:09.558
He can fix me.

07:12.158 --> 07:13.838
As long as you're sure.

07:15.318 --> 07:17.196
I'm doing it for us.

07:17.198 --> 07:19.718
The three of us.

07:21.278 --> 07:24.118
I need a drink.
Let me.

07:30.278 --> 07:32.118
Yes?

07:34.638 --> 07:36.158
Father.

07:37.198 --> 07:40.076
I was just pouring James a
drink.

07:40.078 --> 07:43.836
I'd like a quiet word with my
son, if you don't mind.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.836
What is it?

07:44.838 --> 07:47.278
I'll be in the other room.

07:51.478 --> 07:53.276
Uh, what's wrong?

07:53.278 --> 07:55.956
Might be best
if we keep our voices down,

07:55.958 --> 07:57.958
for Olivia's sake.

08:00.398 --> 08:04.116
You were seen in the Walkers'
barn.

08:04.118 --> 08:06.476
I don't know...

08:06.478 --> 08:08.756
Grandmother has confirmed
what you are,

08:08.758 --> 08:12.478
and Bert Ford
is blackmailing us.

08:15.518 --> 08:17.198
Well?

08:19.478 --> 08:22.276
What have you got
to say for yourself?

08:22.278 --> 08:24.196
James?

08:24.198 --> 08:26.196
I, um...

08:26.198 --> 08:28.878
Is this why you tried
to kill yourself?

08:30.118 --> 08:31.716
Might be best if you had.

08:31.718 --> 08:33.596
You disgust me!

08:33.597 --> 08:35.556
Stop it!

08:35.558 --> 08:37.035
He's your son!

08:37.038 --> 08:38.596
What, you know?
Yes.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.716
For months.
And you're here?

08:40.717 --> 08:44.076
I love James.
If you can't, get out.

08:44.078 --> 08:46.716
The lies?
Can you blame him?!

08:46.718 --> 08:49.236
You just wished him dead!

08:49.238 --> 08:51.476
You should be ashamed, not him.

08:51.478 --> 08:54.316
I know it's a shock,
but we are dealing with it.

08:54.318 --> 08:56.078
Dealing with it?
Yes!

08:59.518 --> 09:01.438
Oh, my darling.

09:06.518 --> 09:09.996
The number on the paper
by the phone, Dr Stewart.

09:09.998 --> 09:11.478
Tell him what's happened.

09:13.638 --> 09:15.438
NOW!

09:18.598 --> 09:20.918
It's alright, I'm here.

09:22.318 --> 09:24.398
It's alright.

09:57.194 --> 09:58.194
Mrs Bligh...

09:58.259 --> 10:00.339
Can't I go with him?
We'll settle him first.

10:00.531 --> 10:02.169
Then you can see him.

10:02.171 --> 10:03.769
A word with you both.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.251
Of course.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.571
A man suffering James's malady

10:08.631 --> 10:11.669
fears the gaze of his father
more than any other.

10:11.671 --> 10:13.251
He's been teetering
on the verge

10:13.271 --> 10:14.451
of a breakdown for months.

10:14.484 --> 10:16.224
You were simply
the tipping point.

10:16.306 --> 10:18.104
Don't be hard on yourself.

10:18.106 --> 10:20.384
Or you on him, Mrs Bligh.

10:20.386 --> 10:24.104
You and Mr Bligh will need
to find some common ground

10:24.106 --> 10:26.904
to help James through this.

10:26.906 --> 10:29.904
For a father to discover
his son is deviant

10:29.906 --> 10:31.824
is a great challenge.

10:31.826 --> 10:33.704
You can take solace, Mr Bligh,

10:33.706 --> 10:36.184
in the fact that
he was seeking help

10:36.186 --> 10:39.944
and in the fact that
he has this woman for his wife.

10:39.946 --> 10:42.224
There's nothing you can do
at the moment.

10:42.226 --> 10:45.344
In fact, your presence
would be counterproductive.

10:45.346 --> 10:47.864
So please return to your life

10:47.866 --> 10:50.544
and I'll keep you informed
of his progress.

10:50.546 --> 10:52.506
I'll telephone
when he's settled.

10:53.546 --> 10:55.746
Any questions?

10:56.786 --> 10:59.746
Look after... my boy.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.424
I understand
how shocked you are.

11:14.426 --> 11:16.984
I was too, initially.

11:16.986 --> 11:20.704
So I can forgive your reaction.

11:20.706 --> 11:24.864
Everything but wishing
he'd succeeded on the ship.

11:24.866 --> 11:27.264
I was upset.
You meant it.

11:27.266 --> 11:30.226
I'm not proud.
Nor should you be.

11:34.506 --> 11:36.824
I am proud of you, however.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.304
I...

11:38.306 --> 11:41.704
And what I've been told,
he's seeking help.

11:41.706 --> 11:43.184
What if that doesn't work?

11:43.186 --> 11:45.824
What if Dr Stewart
can't cure him?

11:45.826 --> 11:48.904
He just said that...
What if he can't?

11:48.906 --> 11:50.944
I'll still love him.

11:50.946 --> 11:52.426
Will you?

11:55.066 --> 11:59.266
If you can't find
the answer yes in your heart...

12:00.306 --> 12:02.226
Don't come back.

12:17.746 --> 12:19.466
Oh.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.544
Welcome back.

12:25.546 --> 12:27.384
Oh.

12:27.386 --> 12:31.344
Oh, what was in
that witches' brew you gave me?

12:31.346 --> 12:33.624
Worked its magic.

12:33.626 --> 12:35.586
What did I say?

12:36.626 --> 12:38.226
You just slept.

12:41.106 --> 12:43.624
I'd like to readmit you.
No.

12:43.626 --> 12:45.104
Look, the way you were...

12:45.106 --> 12:46.664
I can't control this
from a hospital.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.264
You can't control it
from a coffin.

12:48.266 --> 12:50.504
I want you close to care.

12:50.506 --> 12:52.104
I have to be here.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.906
It's not just Sarah, is it?

12:58.866 --> 13:01.464
Alright. I'll leave you
something.

13:01.466 --> 13:03.864
I insist you take it,
even though it will

13:03.866 --> 13:06.426
keep you a bit groggy,
and I'll check in daily.

13:14.746 --> 13:16.224
You lost it?

13:16.226 --> 13:18.466
Just like that?

13:19.786 --> 13:21.784
Yes.

13:21.786 --> 13:23.704
Why?

13:23.706 --> 13:25.664
How?

13:25.666 --> 13:28.666
Perhaps
it just wasn't meant to be.

13:31.906 --> 13:33.864
We'll never hold our baby.

13:33.866 --> 13:35.506
No.

13:36.986 --> 13:39.424
We should be happy.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.106
We should.

13:42.346 --> 13:44.546
This is easier.
Yes.

13:57.106 --> 13:58.546
Come.

13:59.826 --> 14:05.504
Father Joe would say our baby
will spend eternity in Limbo.

14:05.506 --> 14:08.824
I don't believe that.
That's what the Church says.

14:08.826 --> 14:11.226
God should punish us...

14:12.266 --> 14:14.784
not our baby.

14:14.786 --> 14:17.504
I wanna pray here,

14:17.506 --> 14:21.586
not in a place where they say
our baby's damned.

14:28.466 --> 14:31.026
Our baby's soul.

14:41.266 --> 14:43.226
Dear God...

14:45.626 --> 14:47.586
take our baby...

14:48.626 --> 14:50.584
love our baby...

14:50.586 --> 14:52.506
please.

14:53.946 --> 14:55.626
Amen.

14:57.386 --> 14:59.104
You know that I didn't...

14:59.106 --> 15:01.744
If I had done that,
I would tell you.

15:01.746 --> 15:03.906
I know.

15:05.186 --> 15:07.506
You do?

15:08.826 --> 15:11.066
Yes.

15:19.506 --> 15:21.266
I was so scared.

15:28.826 --> 15:31.504
Jack?
He's gone.

15:31.506 --> 15:35.024
Oh, I must've
drifted off again.

15:35.026 --> 15:37.104
George?
No word.

15:37.106 --> 15:39.946
Oh.
I've used the time well.

15:41.026 --> 15:43.104
The Jew's job application.

15:43.106 --> 15:46.986
All the information to give me
a starting point over there.

15:52.346 --> 15:54.344
I've underestimated you.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.146
You have.

15:56.806 --> 15:58.046
I'll pack.

15:58.463 --> 16:00.177
Any money you need,
you let me know.

16:00.179 --> 16:03.577
I'll let you know.
Just remember our quid pro quo.

16:03.579 --> 16:07.537
You rid me of her, you have
my blessing to pursue George.

16:07.539 --> 16:10.459
As my reward or his punishment?

16:18.059 --> 16:21.817
This has
precipitated a complete
breakdown.

16:21.819 --> 16:26.337
It makes our task difficult,
but not impossible.

16:26.339 --> 16:29.497
It's, um... It's best
if you leave him now.

16:29.499 --> 16:32.337
You can see him again
after the first treatment.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.777
I can't...

16:33.779 --> 16:36.977
I will need your total
cooperation.

16:36.979 --> 16:38.259
I'll wait outside.

16:40.939 --> 16:43.179
Can he hear me?

16:44.739 --> 16:49.979
He's retreated into himself,
but I believe so, yes.

16:57.019 --> 16:58.459
Just remember...

17:00.019 --> 17:03.139
we love you.

17:07.138 --> 17:10.819
He didn't mean
the things he said.

17:12.138 --> 17:14.138
He was hurt.

17:15.779 --> 17:18.098
He loves you too.

17:37.819 --> 17:40.099
You're sure?

17:41.139 --> 17:43.297
We have all night.

17:43.299 --> 17:45.419
No-one knows I'm back.

17:52.499 --> 17:53.937
Sister?

17:53.939 --> 17:56.497
You've got a message.
Oh.

17:56.499 --> 17:58.619
Prince Charming telephoned.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.217
He can't see you tonight.

18:01.219 --> 18:03.977
Says he'll see you in the
morning, the usual place.

18:03.979 --> 18:06.777
Who took this?
Maude did. I read it.

18:06.779 --> 18:09.819
You've been living
with Doris too long.

18:26.219 --> 18:28.497
A thousand pounds. Count it.

18:28.499 --> 18:30.257
Oh, I'm sure
I can trust a gentleman

18:30.259 --> 18:32.297
who wants to keep
his son out of jail.

18:32.299 --> 18:34.497
Mind you, there's those inside

18:34.499 --> 18:37.977
who might welcome the arrival
of a good-looking young bloke.

18:37.979 --> 18:39.697
There's another 500
if you leave the district

18:39.699 --> 18:41.179
and never come back.

18:42.939 --> 18:46.539
You trying to separate a man
from his loved ones, George?

18:48.779 --> 18:51.059
Yeah, why not?

18:53.899 --> 18:55.899
You're out of our lives forever.

18:58.499 --> 19:00.897
You cross me on this...

19:00.899 --> 19:02.539
you'll regret it.

19:10.459 --> 19:14.177
I'm not proud of my reaction.
There's no undoing it.

19:14.179 --> 19:16.857
He'll recover?
He's in good hands.

19:16.859 --> 19:18.337
This Dr Stewart?

19:18.339 --> 19:20.537
Seems to be the right man
for the job.

19:20.539 --> 19:22.257
He said he would
keep us informed.

19:22.259 --> 19:24.697
And Olivia?

19:24.699 --> 19:27.417
She's a fine woman.
His strength.

19:27.419 --> 19:29.019
Yes.

19:31.619 --> 19:34.019
You should've told me.

19:35.859 --> 19:39.539
George, sit. We need to put
our differences aside for this.

19:42.619 --> 19:45.337
I've controlled Bert Ford.
Good.

19:45.339 --> 19:48.657
You think you know your
children, and then suddenly...

19:48.659 --> 19:51.339
I could say the same of you.

19:53.219 --> 19:55.857
Your choice of wife
is no less shocking to me

19:55.859 --> 19:57.417
than James's inclinations
are to you.

19:57.419 --> 19:59.137
That is ridiculous.

19:59.139 --> 20:02.057
Both are unexpected,
both are betrayals of the norm.

20:02.059 --> 20:03.937
Sarah and I don't compare.
Oh, stop.

20:03.939 --> 20:06.497
You're at your least attractive
at your most sanctimonious.

20:06.499 --> 20:09.337
You expect me
to accept what he is?

20:09.339 --> 20:11.937
He's your son, George.

20:11.939 --> 20:15.859
You're too good a man
not to... in time.

20:16.859 --> 20:20.417
And I think you're too good
a woman not to accept Sarah...

20:20.419 --> 20:22.577
in time.

20:22.579 --> 20:25.297
Life is full of ironies.

20:25.299 --> 20:28.137
I have always feared that
she would destroy this family.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.857
I can only bend so far.

20:29.859 --> 20:34.017
Mother, if anyone destroys
this family, it will be you.

20:34.019 --> 20:37.219
Don't use Sarah
as your scapegoat.

21:41.625 --> 21:44.703
So much has happened,
I don't know where to start.

21:44.705 --> 21:48.105
Before you do...
we have a problem.

21:49.585 --> 21:51.265
Is he angry?

21:52.265 --> 21:54.183
He's not yelling.

21:54.185 --> 21:56.905
I thought he'd come in
and kill me.

21:57.905 --> 21:59.545
He's coming.

22:00.665 --> 22:03.143
Please, will you stop
and listen?

22:03.145 --> 22:05.143
They want to get married.

22:05.145 --> 22:07.463
And that makes it alright?
They're children.

22:07.465 --> 22:09.303
They're adults
in the eyes of the law.

22:09.305 --> 22:10.783
She's not mature enough
to be...

22:10.785 --> 22:13.185
I think Anna might surprise you.

22:16.305 --> 22:19.103
He's a Catholic.
I'm a Jew.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.783
It's different.
How is it different?

22:21.785 --> 22:25.983
You can't do to them what
Elizabeth's trying to do to us.

22:25.985 --> 22:29.823
Sarah, they're living
some romantic illusion.

22:29.825 --> 22:32.583
It will never last.
I give it three months at best.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.583
Be fair.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.625
Please.

22:36.905 --> 22:39.745
Just go in there
and be... be fair.

22:44.745 --> 22:46.705
George?

22:48.745 --> 22:51.105
What if it did survive
three months?

22:57.705 --> 22:59.503
I should go talk to him.

22:59.505 --> 23:01.543
He's leaving.

23:01.545 --> 23:03.623
Where?

23:03.625 --> 23:05.825
He just turned around.

23:15.905 --> 23:18.703
This involves your parents too.

23:18.705 --> 23:21.663
Your father's gone ahead
to prepare them.

23:21.665 --> 23:23.143
Papa will kill me.

23:23.145 --> 23:24.905
You don't know that.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.703
And I've had an idea
that might help.

23:28.705 --> 23:32.623
After everything you have done
for us, Gino has shamed us.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.543
It was my fault as much as his.

23:34.545 --> 23:36.823
No, Gino is the man.

23:36.825 --> 23:39.303
We're in love, Papa.

23:39.305 --> 23:41.345
We're gonna get married.

23:42.905 --> 23:44.905
What would I know?
I know you can't stop us.

23:48.065 --> 23:50.905
Amo! Carla! This isn't helping.

23:52.065 --> 23:54.383
We're old enough.
We don't need permission.

23:54.385 --> 23:57.905
Miss Anna,
you need God's permission.

23:58.905 --> 24:02.743
Mr George, our son is Catholic,
Miss Anna is not.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.823
Sorry, but she's not right for
him.

24:04.825 --> 24:07.383
I should've spoken.

24:07.385 --> 24:08.903
You knew?

24:08.905 --> 24:10.783
Why you don't tell me?

24:10.785 --> 24:14.423
I thought it would end.
Ah, it end here in sin.

24:14.425 --> 24:18.063
Mr Poletti, the difference
in religion is important, but...

24:18.065 --> 24:19.703
It is everything.

24:19.705 --> 24:23.783
I'm Jewish. Mr Bligh and I
are going to marry.

24:23.785 --> 24:26.983
But he's not Catholic.
No disrespect for you...

24:26.985 --> 24:29.063
Amo, I understand.

24:29.065 --> 24:33.183
If this had happened a couple
of days ago, even yesterday,

24:33.185 --> 24:35.823
I might not have been
so understanding.

24:35.825 --> 24:37.583
But Sarah has made me see

24:37.585 --> 24:41.863
that opposing this
would be hypocrisy.

24:41.865 --> 24:45.263
However, a love affair
is quite different

24:45.265 --> 24:48.103
to living together day by day
as a couple.

24:48.105 --> 24:49.783
That's what we want.

24:49.785 --> 24:52.663
Do you?
Or do you just think you do?

24:52.665 --> 24:54.785
Sarah, please.

24:56.345 --> 24:58.223
Anna and Gino are right.

24:58.225 --> 24:59.823
They can marry
without permission,

24:59.825 --> 25:02.303
and I think
they're quite prepared to.

25:02.305 --> 25:05.623
I'm suggesting you let them
live together for three months

25:05.625 --> 25:07.103
as if they were married.

25:07.105 --> 25:08.623
No, impossible...
In every way

25:08.625 --> 25:10.103
Except sharing a bed.

25:10.105 --> 25:12.743
Anna could move into your home,
in a separate room,

25:12.745 --> 25:15.863
and live the life of Gino's
wife.

25:15.865 --> 25:19.105
Mr George, you...
you agree with this?

25:21.065 --> 25:22.545
Yes.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.463
Anna?

25:26.465 --> 25:29.143
I thought...
What?

25:29.145 --> 25:31.943
I thought Gino would come
to live with us.

25:31.945 --> 25:33.663
Is that what you thought?

25:33.665 --> 25:36.985
My wife lives here with me.

25:38.305 --> 25:40.985
I see what you're doing.

25:42.345 --> 25:45.863
You think that
I'm your spoilt rich daughter

25:45.865 --> 25:47.623
who won't be able to do it.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.623
I'm giving you a chance.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.463
Alright.

25:51.465 --> 25:54.185
I would do anything
to be with Gino.

25:55.265 --> 25:58.183
Three months, and I will become

25:58.185 --> 26:02.023
the perfect Catholic
grape farmer's wife.

26:02.025 --> 26:05.265
You see? You will all see.

26:10.065 --> 26:13.023
And the Polettis agreed?

26:13.025 --> 26:15.063
After lengthy discussion.
Huh!

26:15.065 --> 26:17.743
They were about to elope.
We're lucky they didn't.

26:17.745 --> 26:19.583
Yeah, a small consolation.

26:19.585 --> 26:22.063
She won't last three weeks,
let alone three months.

26:22.065 --> 26:24.623
How long it lasts
is irrelevant, George.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.985
Her reputation will be
tarnished irrevocably.

26:29.305 --> 26:30.783
Where is she?

26:30.785 --> 26:32.423
In her room.
Yeah.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.263
Mustering the courage
to face me, I imagine.

26:35.265 --> 26:38.703
And this ludicrous scheme
was your fiancee's idea?

26:38.705 --> 26:41.985
I agreed.
You wonder why I feel...

26:43.665 --> 26:45.223
Thank you, George.

26:45.225 --> 26:47.065
Mother...
I said thank you.

27:01.545 --> 27:03.543
Next stop, Inverness.

27:03.545 --> 27:05.545
Inverness, next stop.

27:20.825 --> 27:23.185
Regina!

27:33.065 --> 27:34.585
Yes?

27:37.345 --> 27:39.783
If you have the courage
to make a choice,

27:39.785 --> 27:41.743
have the courage to face
the consequences.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.383
I was coming to see you.

27:43.385 --> 27:45.903
Yet here I am.

27:45.905 --> 27:48.345
I'm sorry I'm hurting you.

27:51.145 --> 27:53.703
It's the hurt to yourself
that worries me,

27:53.705 --> 27:55.263
when word of this gets out.

27:55.265 --> 27:57.823
I will be Mrs Gino Poletti.
I won't care.

27:57.825 --> 27:59.703
And what if you're not?

27:59.705 --> 28:01.983
What will you be then?

28:01.985 --> 28:04.583
There's only so much I can do
to contain this.

28:04.585 --> 28:06.183
I don't need your help.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.063
I don't want it. I just want
him.

28:09.065 --> 28:12.063
His Latin charms will fade,
my dear.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.105
And where will you be then?

28:15.145 --> 28:16.903
You're so bitter.

28:16.905 --> 28:20.143
You're going to end up
old and alone.

28:20.145 --> 28:22.145
Yeah, I am old.

28:23.465 --> 28:25.103
And I am alone.

28:25.105 --> 28:28.345
And all I ever wanted was
to hold this family together.

28:29.905 --> 28:33.343
Ash Park, to you,
will never be closed,

28:33.345 --> 28:37.665
but if you do this,
my heart will be.

28:38.705 --> 28:40.745
Is that what you said to...

28:43.105 --> 28:45.265
to Aunt Carolyn...

28:47.865 --> 28:51.065
when you turned your back on
her?

28:53.505 --> 28:54.985
Very similar.

28:55.985 --> 29:00.425
If I could do it to her,
I can certainly do it to you.

29:02.745 --> 29:04.743
Electroconvulsive therapy,

29:04.745 --> 29:07.623
or "shock treatment"
as it's sometimes referred to,

29:07.625 --> 29:11.463
is a medical procedure in which
brief electrical stimulus

29:11.465 --> 29:14.543
is used to induce
a cerebral seizure -

29:14.545 --> 29:17.263
a layman might call it
a "brain seizure" -

29:17.265 --> 29:19.063
under controlled conditions.

29:19.065 --> 29:21.183
It's not pleasant.

29:21.185 --> 29:23.463
Your collapse
into yourself is serious

29:23.465 --> 29:25.343
and must be treated immediately.

29:25.345 --> 29:27.703
We'll cure
your sexual aberration later

29:27.705 --> 29:30.063
using a different technique.

29:30.065 --> 29:31.783
There's nothing to fear.

29:31.785 --> 29:34.463
It's been used
on thousands of patients.

29:34.465 --> 29:36.105
Now.

29:37.145 --> 29:38.983
No, stay still.

29:38.985 --> 29:42.225
This is just to prevent you
hurting yourself.

29:59.985 --> 30:01.783
You're supposed to be gone.

30:01.785 --> 30:03.703
Yeah, on my way.

30:03.705 --> 30:05.703
But I've been thinking.

30:05.705 --> 30:08.345
Another 500 would
make sure of things.

30:09.345 --> 30:11.465
We had a deal.

30:14.545 --> 30:17.385
Nah, I reckon you got off
light.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.082
Two hours late.
Can't say I'm impressed.

30:26.201 --> 30:29.879
I had to deal with a situation.
What situation?

30:29.881 --> 30:32.239
Look, I'd tell you about it
if I could.

30:32.241 --> 30:33.679
It's...
Right.

30:33.681 --> 30:35.199
Two days engaged

30:35.201 --> 30:37.279
and it's already
interfering with your work.

30:37.281 --> 30:39.679
It won't happen again.
I hope not.

30:39.681 --> 30:43.001
I better get on with it.
Alma's handling it. No need.

30:44.601 --> 30:46.999
Take a couple of days,
sort out whatever you have to.

30:47.001 --> 30:48.801
I don't need a couple of...
Don't you?

30:51.081 --> 30:52.959
You reckon
you're gonna make this work?

30:52.961 --> 30:54.999
I can combine
a job and a marriage.

30:55.001 --> 30:56.679
It's not just any marriage.

30:56.681 --> 30:59.159
And if I can't,
you won't have to fire me.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.641
Trust me. I'll resign.

31:02.681 --> 31:05.199
He took
the first treatment well.

31:05.201 --> 31:07.799
We'll continue
on a regular basis.

31:07.801 --> 31:09.919
It's painful and disorienting.

31:09.921 --> 31:13.001
It can also lead
to memory loss.

31:15.881 --> 31:18.081
Or even confuse you
with others...

31:43.601 --> 31:46.079
You must be strong
when you see him.

31:46.081 --> 31:47.559
I can manage.

31:47.561 --> 31:49.321
Don't let him down.

32:05.961 --> 32:08.321
I'm scared.

32:14.881 --> 32:16.721
I'm here.

32:19.041 --> 32:21.241
You can do this.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.679
You know you can.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.041
Can I?

32:27.081 --> 32:28.881
Yes.

32:34.401 --> 32:36.281
Who am I?

32:37.481 --> 32:38.961
James.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.239
I'm Olivia.

32:42.241 --> 32:44.879
You're my husband.

32:44.881 --> 32:46.681
James.

32:51.521 --> 32:52.999
Bligh.

32:53.001 --> 32:55.001
Yes.

32:58.761 --> 33:00.241
James Bligh.

33:08.081 --> 33:10.039
Ah, Regina, ask Norman to bring

33:10.041 --> 33:11.999
the car around,
would you, please?

33:12.001 --> 33:13.919
I have calls to make.
Calls?

33:13.921 --> 33:16.239
Yes. The first one
doesn't concern you.

33:16.241 --> 33:18.159
The second most certainly does.

33:18.161 --> 33:21.999
You're going to need time
to unearth anything useful.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.959
You can have three months.

33:23.961 --> 33:26.121
Off you go.

33:30.721 --> 33:32.719
She must have her own room!

33:32.721 --> 33:34.359
She sleeps with Gilda.

33:34.361 --> 33:36.999
I'll move onto the veranda.
She shares a bed!

33:37.001 --> 33:39.159
She will share your bed
when you marry.

33:39.161 --> 33:41.001
You wanna scare her off?

33:42.001 --> 33:43.599
Papa, has made a decision.

33:43.601 --> 33:44.599
Mama.

33:44.601 --> 33:46.881
She shares a bed. Finito!

33:56.481 --> 33:57.959
Mrs Bligh.

33:57.961 --> 33:59.759
Carla. Amo.

33:59.761 --> 34:00.839
Mrs Bligh.

34:00.841 --> 34:02.599
You did your best.

34:02.601 --> 34:04.561
I understand.

34:06.081 --> 34:07.561
You.

34:08.721 --> 34:10.679
I love Anna.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.799
You THINK you do.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.839
You think you know her.

34:14.841 --> 34:16.319
You don't.

34:16.321 --> 34:20.119
You think you know us,
but you don't.

34:20.121 --> 34:22.319
She will break your heart.

34:22.321 --> 34:26.121
I wish I could say
you don't deserve it.

34:27.321 --> 34:30.039
Look after her. Bring her back
as soon as possible.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.281
Yes.

34:33.001 --> 34:34.801
You, I will never forgive.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.081
I'll make a good husband.

34:58.121 --> 35:00.001
She'll make a good wife.

35:03.161 --> 35:06.041
My love to Martin. OK.

35:08.521 --> 35:10.319
Miss Carolyn?

35:10.321 --> 35:13.119
It is! Goodness me!

35:13.121 --> 35:14.919
It's been so long!

35:14.921 --> 35:16.559
Hello, Mrs Collins.

35:16.561 --> 35:20.481
Look how glamorous
and sophisticated you are.

35:22.001 --> 35:23.679
You're back home
for the announcement

35:23.681 --> 35:25.359
of the engagement, no doubt.

35:25.361 --> 35:26.999
Something like that.

35:27.001 --> 35:30.319
Nothing like a special occasion
to bring a family together.

35:30.321 --> 35:33.119
I'm sure
your mother misses you.

35:33.121 --> 35:35.639
At times, I'm sure she does.

35:35.641 --> 35:38.359
You're not being picked up
by the family car, then?

35:38.361 --> 35:39.919
Not just yet.

35:39.921 --> 35:42.079
Catching up with an old friend.

35:42.081 --> 35:43.561
Oh...

35:52.281 --> 35:53.761
Thank you.

36:01.001 --> 36:03.039
It's a clever idea of yours,

36:03.041 --> 36:05.719
exposing Anna to the rigours
of Poletti life.

36:05.721 --> 36:07.921
She may prove up to them.

36:09.481 --> 36:13.199
She has a lot more to her
than you give her credit for.

36:13.201 --> 36:17.159
I'm not here to be lectured
about my own granddaughter.

36:17.161 --> 36:19.119
Why are you here?

36:19.121 --> 36:21.439
This three-month scheme...

36:21.441 --> 36:22.919
Yes?

36:22.921 --> 36:24.719
You're convinced of its worth?

36:24.721 --> 36:26.839
Yes.
You stand by it?

36:26.841 --> 36:27.999
Yes.

36:28.001 --> 36:30.121
Very well.

36:31.601 --> 36:33.319
I shall support it...

36:33.321 --> 36:35.519
on one condition.

36:35.521 --> 36:38.599
While Anna lives
with the Polettis,

36:38.601 --> 36:42.319
testing her resolve
to marry inappropriately,

36:42.321 --> 36:47.519
you will spend three months
at Ash Park doing the same.

36:47.521 --> 36:49.359
That won't change anything.

36:49.361 --> 36:53.161
Ooh, but it might...
significantly.

36:54.841 --> 36:59.639
If you do fit into our milieu,
my will could change again.

36:59.641 --> 37:02.601
George could have
both you and Ash Park.

37:03.881 --> 37:08.319
Three months sacrificed so that
he may once again inherit...

37:08.321 --> 37:10.199
That sounds like blackmail.

37:10.201 --> 37:13.721
Well, I think of it
as me being fair.

37:14.961 --> 37:18.161
And who will judge
whether or not I fit in?

37:19.521 --> 37:21.519
Why you, of course.

37:21.521 --> 37:23.801
As Anna will her situation.

37:24.841 --> 37:28.521
At the end of three months,
you will both know.

37:29.961 --> 37:32.281
Well?

38:05.857 --> 38:07.857
Three months.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.258
13 weeks, 90 days.

38:10.260 --> 38:12.218
If Anna can do it...

38:12.220 --> 38:14.178
Anna's moving into a house

38:14.180 --> 38:16.738
where she doesn't have
a sworn enemy.

38:16.740 --> 38:18.898
You don't have to
do this for me.

38:18.900 --> 38:21.058
I want to.

38:21.060 --> 38:24.818
And I want to prove to her
that she's wrong about me.

38:24.820 --> 38:27.178
My mother will do anything
to sabotage you.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.178
Let her.
She's tough.

38:29.180 --> 38:30.980
I'm tougher.

38:33.220 --> 38:36.178
I know who
I'll be putting my money on.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.820
So do I.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.580
Yes?

38:54.980 --> 38:57.180
Carolyn?

38:59.780 --> 39:01.778
It's been a long time, Jack.

39:01.780 --> 39:04.580
Over 20 years.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.460
What...

39:11.740 --> 39:14.100
I've come to talk
about our daughter.
