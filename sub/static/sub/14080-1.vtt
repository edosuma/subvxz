WEBVTT

00:40.458 --> 00:44.378
My aim is to stay alive.
I don't want to die.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.259
What is worth dying for?

00:50.426 --> 00:54.346
Is diving into a cave
worth dying for?

00:55.931 --> 00:58.517
The time comes for everyone.

00:59.018 --> 01:05.316
I do everything I can
not to die down there.

01:13.282 --> 01:17.161
MONAMI AGENCY PRESENTS

01:22.833 --> 01:26.754
IN ASSOCIATION
WITH FUGLENE

01:30.091 --> 01:34.095
A JUAN REINA FILM

01:37.014 --> 01:42.978
DIVING INTO THE UNKNOWN

01:54.073 --> 01:58.202
People often ask:
"What makes you go down there,

01:58.369 --> 02:01.455
into places hostile
to human beings."

02:15.177 --> 02:20.224
Modern technology gives us
the chance to explore

02:20.391 --> 02:24.603
every place on Earth and
on the bottom of the sea

02:24.770 --> 02:27.606
without going there yourself.

02:28.816 --> 02:34.822
The only place left that
technology cannot reach are caves.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.783
Both dry and underwater caves.

02:50.588 --> 02:54.842
For me caves are very visual places.
I enjoy that.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.846
The silence makes
a strong impression.

02:59.013 --> 03:03.142
You are looking around
in total silence.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.271
The further you dive,
you find new places

03:07.438 --> 03:10.399
that may be familiar,

03:10.566 --> 03:14.236
or in some special cases
you get to dive in places

03:14.403 --> 03:17.239
no one has ever been before.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.533
It's a fantastic feeling

03:19.700 --> 03:23.245
when no one knows
what is behind the corner.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.751
That is the true
feeling of exploration.

03:31.253 --> 03:36.967
The dives we do are
potentially life-threatening.

03:39.303 --> 03:42.056
There is always danger

03:42.223 --> 03:46.143
but you don't dive with
just anyone.

03:46.644 --> 03:50.064
You have to trust
your fellow divers 100%.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.359
You can never underestimate

03:53.525 --> 03:57.613
the importance of your
diving partner or team.

04:02.618 --> 04:06.622
We kind of have
our own brotherhood

04:06.789 --> 04:09.917
on the dives we do.

04:10.084 --> 04:14.546
You are there with the friends
you trust most.

04:23.681 --> 04:31.105
Our diving team is formed
around the Ojamo mine.

04:31.313 --> 04:36.026
I have met a lot of
new people there.

04:36.193 --> 04:40.281
We do a lot of traveling together.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.159
They are the ones I like to
travel and dive with most.

04:44.326 --> 04:49.665
I have made a lot of good
friends diving.

04:49.832 --> 04:54.420
It's such a great feeling
to travel with them

04:54.586 --> 04:58.090
and to spend vacations together.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.759
It has to be fun.

05:00.926 --> 05:04.722
If it's not fun
there's no point in doing it.

05:05.889 --> 05:10.311
It's amazing to see places
no one else has seen before.

05:11.437 --> 05:16.442
And to do that with
people who are so dedicated.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.029
It's a very hands on
type of group.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.037
We went to Norway intending

05:28.203 --> 05:33.167
to film the deep part
of the route,

05:33.334 --> 05:38.172
because no one has filmed
the entire route before.

05:38.756 --> 05:44.887
We were planning to dive
from Plura to Steinugleflåget,

05:45.054 --> 05:49.725
leave the gear there overnight
and dive back the next day.

05:50.476 --> 05:54.396
<i>Should I bring the rebreather
and everything else here?</i>

05:54.563 --> 05:57.900
Team one was Jari Huotarinen
and Patte.

05:58.067 --> 06:02.321
Their job was to make a hole
in the ice on the Plura side.

06:06.325 --> 06:10.287
Team two was me, Kaitsu
and Jari Uusimäki.

06:10.454 --> 06:14.166
Our job was to climb up
inside Steinugleflåget

06:14.333 --> 06:17.378
and take our second set
of equipment there.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.880
<i>Start the chainsaw,
Hamster.</i>

06:20.047 --> 06:23.133
The mood was laid back,
everyone was laughing.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.636
We were in a good mood
when we set out.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.013
<i>It's a bit slippery here.</i>

06:28.514 --> 06:31.433
I think everything went well.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.105
Jari and I made the hole
and were ready to go

06:36.271 --> 06:43.779
when team two told us the path
and equipment were ready

06:44.154 --> 06:49.993
and the hole was open,
so you could also get out.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.373
So, we started to get going.

06:56.542 --> 07:00.629
<i>What do you think?
Should we wait or should we just go?</i>

07:02.005 --> 07:03.924
<i>I agree.</i>

07:04.591 --> 07:07.678
<i>Famous cave diver "the Hamster".</i>

07:08.846 --> 07:10.305
<i>The hole.</i>

07:10.472 --> 07:13.600
<i>Goddamn, it's clear in there!</i>

07:20.232 --> 07:23.694
<i>Do you have two oxygen tanks?</i>

07:24.486 --> 07:27.072
<i>And two argons?
- Yeah.</i>

07:27.239 --> 07:28.699
<i>Okay.</i>

07:28.866 --> 07:31.577
<i>Are they for the trip back home?</i>

07:31.743 --> 07:35.581
<i>Well, for the trip back...
- Or if there is a problem.</i>

07:35.747 --> 07:39.585
<i>Not for today or tomorrow, but...</i>

07:39.751 --> 07:44.006
<i>Then we have one extra oxygen.
- Yes, we do.</i>

07:57.311 --> 08:01.106
When team one entered the water,
we started preparing

08:01.273 --> 08:06.653
and we left about
two hours after them.

08:12.451 --> 08:18.457
The dive between Plura and Steine
was really challenging

08:18.624 --> 08:22.878
but I have done
way more demanding dives

08:23.045 --> 08:29.051
with all of the guys we were
diving with that day.

08:29.885 --> 08:34.597
This shouldn't have been
an overly challenging dive.

08:38.018 --> 08:44.691
Looking back, perhaps we could have
done some things differently.

08:45.108 --> 08:53.108
But the accident happened in
a very short period of time.

08:55.953 --> 09:02.125
In that brief moment,
I did everything I possibly could.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.462
But the conditions were not easy.

09:09.049 --> 09:13.262
The beginning of the dive
had gone well for team one.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.890
When they passed
the deepest part,

09:17.057 --> 09:21.144
they reached a narrow tunnel
at a depth of 110 metres.

09:21.311 --> 09:26.275
Patte went through it first,
with Jari behind him.

09:26.441 --> 09:30.195
His equipment got stuck
in the tunnel.

09:31.029 --> 09:35.742
This created a cascade of problems

09:35.909 --> 09:40.289
which he didn't survive,
although Patte tried to help.

09:44.876 --> 09:49.881
We passed the deepest part,
and the cave started inclining

09:50.048 --> 09:52.342
I went through it.

09:52.551 --> 09:56.138
I saw Jari flashing his light at me.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.349
He was signaling for me
to come over.

09:59.516 --> 10:03.478
I noticed that he was
caught up in the line.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.359
I saw that he was
getting nervous,

10:09.526 --> 10:13.989
which always happens
if you get stuck so deep.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.826
I kept telling him to calm down.

10:17.993 --> 10:23.415
He gave me a tank, which I
started carrying back and forth.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.423
At some point,
he had nothing in his mouth.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.844
He was changing the regulator...
the mouthpiece.

10:36.928 --> 10:40.515
Then I saw him
taking in some water.

10:41.183 --> 10:44.144
I tried to push the regulator
into his mouth

10:44.311 --> 10:47.064
but of course it didn't work.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.861
Gradually he stopped moving.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.240
Jari was gone.

11:05.248 --> 11:11.046
I stayed there for a while,
trying to get him out.

11:12.839 --> 11:18.387
I soon realized
it wasn't going to work.

11:18.553 --> 11:22.224
I was also breathing too fast.

11:22.391 --> 11:26.770
I had to calm down and think.

11:39.950 --> 11:45.872
The first thing I thought was that
when the next team arrives

11:46.206 --> 11:51.461
this passage will be blocked and...

11:51.628 --> 11:55.674
I just remember thinking
they will all be trapped.

11:58.427 --> 12:03.598
I hardly remember the accident.

12:04.057 --> 12:09.438
I don't have a coherent
memory of the event.

12:09.604 --> 12:17.154
I remember certain images
of what happened.

12:22.993 --> 12:27.247
Suddenly I saw Uusimäki
in front of me.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.959
He was clearly having
some trouble.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.587
He tried calling out to me.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.131
I figured that
something was wrong.

12:36.298 --> 12:40.135
Everything happened
in a few minutes.

12:40.635 --> 12:44.514
After that,
I saw that Uusimäki was...

12:45.265 --> 12:48.268
...dead.

12:54.441 --> 12:59.613
I was in a hurry to
decide what to do.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.658
I swam past Uusimäki.

13:04.034 --> 13:08.330
Then I realized
more people were dead.

13:08.538 --> 13:12.876
I mean Jari Huotarinen.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.257
Next to Huotarinen was
Vesa Rantanen

13:19.591 --> 13:23.053
who tried to get through
the narrowing

13:23.220 --> 13:27.557
where Huotarinen
had gotten stuck.

13:30.227 --> 13:35.816
Then I decided to go back
the way I had come

13:35.982 --> 13:41.613
because I wasn't sure that
Vesa would make it through.

13:41.780 --> 13:46.743
I also didn't know what lay
beyond the obstruction.

13:46.910 --> 13:52.332
Would Patrik be there
blocking the way too?

13:53.208 --> 13:55.544
Or will the path be clear?

14:06.555 --> 14:09.891
130 metres down,

14:10.058 --> 14:14.229
I could hear
Huotarinen's equipment beeping.

14:15.230 --> 14:20.110
Then I saw that Jari had died
in the narrowing.

14:23.989 --> 14:27.492
My next thought was
to keep moving forward.

14:27.659 --> 14:32.455
I need to figure out
how to move past Jari.

14:33.290 --> 14:37.002
I knew if I turned around,

14:37.168 --> 14:41.506
the dive back would be too much.

14:41.673 --> 14:48.388
A dive Kaitsu eventually did -
a more than ten-hour dive.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.647
I really don't even know

14:57.814 --> 15:01.651
how I managed to keep
myself together.

15:03.111 --> 15:08.700
My family was probably
the biggest reason why...

15:13.788 --> 15:17.834
...I wanted to get out.

15:24.549 --> 15:30.597
<i>Two Finnish men have died in
a diving accident in northern Norway.</i>

15:30.889 --> 15:34.684
<i>Three of their friends
were also injured.</i>

15:34.851 --> 15:37.854
<i>The accident happened
in an underwater cave</i>

15:38.021 --> 15:40.523
<i>near the town of Mo i Rana.</i>

15:40.690 --> 15:46.029
<i>This small mountain pool is where the
Finnish men began their tragic dive.</i>

15:46.196 --> 15:50.033
<i>The police say that the victims
are 130 metres deep,</i>

15:50.200 --> 15:53.912
<i>and that foreign help
is needed in their search.</i>

15:54.079 --> 15:59.292
<i>Now, all movement and diving
in the area is prohibited.</i>

16:01.962 --> 16:05.674
Although it is sad
on so many levels

16:05.840 --> 16:09.386
that they are not here
with us anymore,

16:09.552 --> 16:14.057
there is no use thinking about
their earthly bodies.

16:14.224 --> 16:20.855
It's better to remember all the
great times we've had together

16:21.022 --> 16:25.276
and all the trips and dives
we've had together.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.488
I don't believe in a higher power,

16:28.655 --> 16:33.952
but one place that they'll
always be is in our memories.

16:35.370 --> 16:39.791
AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM TRIED
UNSUCCESSFULLY TO RETRIEVE THE BODIES

16:39.958 --> 16:44.170
THE NORWEGIAN POLICE
CLOSED THE CAVE

16:45.088 --> 16:50.051
<i>We had to abort
the ongoing operation,</i>

16:50.260 --> 16:55.056
<i>because we felt it was too risky.</i>

16:55.223 --> 17:00.437
<i>After an assessment,
we decided to abort the operation.</i>

17:01.688 --> 17:06.818
<i>For the time being, access
to the cave is prohibited.</i>

17:06.984 --> 17:10.780
<i>This was the decision
of the chief of police.</i>

17:13.742 --> 17:17.287
<i>You only found one victim.
Is the other one even deeper?</i>

17:17.454 --> 17:20.749
<i>We couldn't even access
that part of the cave,</i>

17:20.915 --> 17:24.127
<i>because the passage
is blocked by the first victim.</i>

17:24.294 --> 17:27.130
<i>So, it's impossible to get past.</i>

17:27.297 --> 17:31.718
<i>Every single dive that we do
to those depths in a cave is a risk.</i>

17:32.719 --> 17:37.807
<i>And the more dives we do,
the more risk there is.</i>

17:38.308 --> 17:40.643
<i>This really is just too dangerous.</i>

17:40.810 --> 17:45.899
<i>It's not worth to risk your own lives
to complete this task.</i>

17:46.524 --> 17:49.736
The operation has been called off.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.781
We cannot just leave them there.

17:52.947 --> 17:57.452
I don't know how their families
and friends would take it.

17:58.620 --> 18:03.083
I guess it's a kind of
a grave, but...

18:03.249 --> 18:06.961
I don't even want to
think about it.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.091
I've barely slept because

18:11.257 --> 18:14.427
I'm constantly
thinking about what happened

18:14.594 --> 18:18.139
and planning how to bring
our friends home.

18:22.352 --> 18:26.773
We feel like it's our job
to bring the boys home.

18:26.940 --> 18:32.487
We have the right team, equipment
and the skills to do it.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.573
It would be a great injustice

18:35.740 --> 18:39.702
if we didn't go to Plura
to get this done.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.625
This operation is illegal,
so the problem is that

18:45.792 --> 18:50.547
we have to take more risks,
because we are working in secret.

18:50.713 --> 18:54.050
But we have no other option.

18:54.759 --> 18:58.721
We cannot leave those
guys in that cave.

19:11.609 --> 19:15.738
On the first dive we won't
start carrying anyone.

19:15.905 --> 19:20.326
If he gets stuck and we have to
go back the way we came

19:20.493 --> 19:23.621
it's going to be
a very long dive.

19:23.788 --> 19:28.710
And the guy who is behind
won't enjoy that at all.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.963
The dive would be
too hard to handle.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.595
If everything goes well,
we'll be done in three dives.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.932
There are 16 people
in this operation.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.227
We have Kaitsu, Patte and me.

19:46.394 --> 19:51.691
Our job is to dive the deepest,
to the victims.

19:51.858 --> 19:56.362
We'll release them and
bring them up to shallower water.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.657
But we cannot do this without

19:59.824 --> 20:03.661
safety divers and assistant divers.

20:03.953 --> 20:07.999
They will make sure that
we get out safely,

20:08.166 --> 20:13.463
and they act as a link
between us and the surface.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.925
I am the surface manager.

20:17.091 --> 20:20.136
I handle the operation
on the surface.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.764
The others do the diving.

20:22.931 --> 20:27.018
My spinal cord was damaged
in the accident

20:27.185 --> 20:30.855
from decompression sickness,
so I can't dive myself.

20:31.022 --> 20:35.193
But I am going there to help
the other divers.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.572
I took a couple of body bags
from storage.

20:39.739 --> 20:44.035
If no one else wants to,
I'll bag them.

20:44.202 --> 20:47.664
Aren't we going to
leave them in the water?

20:47.830 --> 20:51.167
I thought we would bring
them to the surface.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.837
I just thought, if there are
animals in the cave...

20:55.004 --> 20:59.092
That won't be a problem.
- They can't get into the bag.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.637
Would it be better
if they were left in the water

21:02.804 --> 21:06.224
and if they stayed face down?

21:06.391 --> 21:11.521
It might take a day or two
before we get them out.

21:11.688 --> 21:16.943
The bag is airtight.
It has a zipper.

21:17.110 --> 21:21.447
Did you find out anything
about the stiffness of the bodies?

21:21.614 --> 21:26.244
Basically it starts
within the first 6 hours

21:26.411 --> 21:29.998
and during the next 6 hours
it's well under way.

21:30.164 --> 21:33.459
Then it's on for
the next 12 hours,

21:33.626 --> 21:37.046
and during the third 12 hours,
it starts going away.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.341
That is normally what happens,

21:40.508 --> 21:43.720
but when it's colder
that process slows down.

21:43.886 --> 21:47.265
It's completely different
in cold water.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.601
What about rotting?
It takes months.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.521
Or maybe a month?

21:53.688 --> 21:57.442
I was just thinking how soft...

21:57.608 --> 22:01.404
They have been
inside their suits.

22:01.571 --> 22:05.575
So it's not as bad as if
they'd been in the water.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.620
What else?
- Communications, mostly.

22:09.787 --> 22:14.417
We have to be mentally prepared
for getting caught.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.170
That's when the
media circus would start.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.839
If someone asks something,

22:20.006 --> 22:24.177
obviously we won't tell them
what we are doing, we are just diving.

22:24.344 --> 22:29.265
Or we act as dumb as possible,
which should be easy.

22:31.934 --> 22:36.647
One risk factor is that
we are emotionally involved.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.484
We all know the victims.

22:39.650 --> 22:43.071
But that cave, those conditions,

22:43.237 --> 22:45.490
that particular place...

22:45.656 --> 22:50.036
No one else has ever been there
or managed to dive there

22:50.203 --> 22:53.539
except the group
that is going there.

23:13.976 --> 23:17.897
I wonder if
Laura is coming or not?

23:18.064 --> 23:20.817
You can call and ask her.

23:20.983 --> 23:25.238
On the other hand, she might
go to the wreck seminar.

23:25.405 --> 23:30.284
Okay. It was the 27th.
From Friday to Monday.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.121
So, four days on location.

23:33.287 --> 23:38.292
It's a six-day trip if the travel time
takes a day each way.

23:38.459 --> 23:42.713
The thing that you
cannot really prepare for,

23:42.880 --> 23:45.675
especially with Kaitsu,
Patte and Sami,

23:45.842 --> 23:49.387
is how things will look
when they get down there.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.265
And how that will
affect you mentally.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.643
So you can keep
yourself together.

23:55.810 --> 24:00.398
But I have faith that they will.

24:00.565 --> 24:05.987
The accident was already
so hard for them,

24:06.154 --> 24:08.990
and they made it to the surface.

24:09.157 --> 24:13.077
I don't think this is
an impossible task.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.587
Bad things that could happen...

24:22.753 --> 24:26.716
The suit tearing
would be really bad.

24:26.883 --> 24:31.888
You would have to return to the
surface, or you would die.

24:35.391 --> 24:39.103
Could I have a napkin?
- Yes.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.023
Thank you.

24:42.190 --> 24:47.945
If your respiratory rate goes up,
that is really bad too.

24:48.112 --> 24:53.409
More carbon dioxide is generated
in deep water

24:53.576 --> 24:58.498
and you wouldn't be
able to function anymore.

25:03.878 --> 25:09.425
From the outside
this might seem foolishly risky.

25:10.218 --> 25:14.764
But life in general
can be risky.

25:14.931 --> 25:20.186
You cannot prepare for everything
that could go wrong.

25:20.353 --> 25:28.353
You just cannot practice facing
a dead friend at 110 metres.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.756
PLURDALEN, NORWAY

26:24.000 --> 26:29.088
The Plurdalen valley is located
near the town of Mo i Rana.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.718
There are lofty mountains
on both sides.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.553
PLURA ENTRANCE

26:35.720 --> 26:40.516
A few hundred metres off
is the mouth of the Plura cave,

26:40.683 --> 26:43.477
and a kilometer further

26:43.644 --> 26:49.483
is the entrance
of the Steinugleflåget dry cave.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.653
Which is a massive cave-in.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.197
STEINUGLEFLÅGET DRY CAVE

26:55.364 --> 27:00.411
It's 300 metres from the mouth
of the cave to the surface.

27:00.578 --> 27:03.414
And the height difference
is 100 metres.

27:03.581 --> 27:06.876
It's quite a job to get

27:07.043 --> 27:11.505
to the surface from
the mouth of the cave.

27:25.645 --> 27:32.443
You have to carry the tanks 30
or 40 metres down, because

27:35.696 --> 27:39.158
it's too steep.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.720
Tommi! Stay there.
Wait a moment.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.807
Let me give you this, Jani.
We'll get them, damn it.

28:45.641 --> 28:49.311
Here is the first one.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.859
Is there still
a lot of stuff up there?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.820
A couple of tanks and a scooter.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.072
Okay.

29:12.543 --> 29:15.337
Are we done?

29:15.504 --> 29:19.550
Yes. Nice.
- Is there still something up there?

29:19.842 --> 29:22.678
...18, 19, 20.

29:23.012 --> 29:25.389
There should be 24.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.477
There are three or four up there.
We will get them tomorrow.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.940
There are a few things

29:35.107 --> 29:38.611
that will define what we do
over the next few days.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.155
What do we want to
bring up from there?

29:41.322 --> 29:43.908
Do we just want the guys up,

29:44.074 --> 29:47.912
or do we want the guys
and their gear?

29:48.078 --> 29:52.500
If we want to bring
more of the gear up,

29:52.666 --> 29:56.629
it'll take an extra day or two

29:56.796 --> 30:00.841
and some of us will be
leaving before then.

30:01.008 --> 30:05.054
If we go there tomorrow,
we can get Jari

30:05.221 --> 30:07.515
and probably his scooter.

30:07.681 --> 30:11.393
Depending on who is diving,

30:11.560 --> 30:14.855
we might even
get some rebreathers.

30:15.439 --> 30:21.862
Kaitsu, do you remember
if Jari closed the loop?

30:22.488 --> 30:26.492
I don't remember...
I mean, I didn't see it.

30:26.659 --> 30:33.332
If the loop was closed
and the machine is dry,

30:33.791 --> 30:38.170
it could be worth some money
for the heirs.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.299
But again, we have to
remember the risks.

30:42.466 --> 30:47.555
Maybe we shouldn't take the risk.
We can't sell a dead man's gear.

30:47.721 --> 30:51.433
If it's upside down,
it may be flooded.

30:51.600 --> 30:56.021
The only thing is really
Uusimäki's scooter.

30:56.188 --> 31:01.569
If his wife gets it back,
and we could find a buyer for it.

31:01.735 --> 31:04.530
They would get
some money from it.

31:04.697 --> 31:08.117
It's easy to get that,
it weighs nothing.

31:09.618 --> 31:14.707
So, should we get Jari
and both scooters?

31:14.874 --> 31:18.878
Yes.
- We can get all of that tomorrow.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.756
Okay.
- Good night.

31:25.926 --> 31:30.514
Good morning. How are you?
- Very good.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.645
Is someone going to Mo today?

31:36.812 --> 31:41.066
Sorry?
- Is someone going to Mo i Rana today?

31:41.233 --> 31:45.654
I don't know, maybe.
- You need gas.

31:45.821 --> 31:49.783
If someone goes to Mo i Rana,
it's in the evening.

31:49.950 --> 31:53.412
Can we drive with
just your scooter?

31:53.579 --> 31:57.708
Yes, we can do that.
It's soaked.

31:57.875 --> 32:03.339
There is a little left,
but we'll drive until it's empty.

32:27.488 --> 32:29.990
How big should it be?

32:30.199 --> 32:32.576
Bang on it a bit.

32:32.743 --> 32:35.245
Like this?

33:05.359 --> 33:11.198
Jari Huotarinen and I
were good friends.

33:13.200 --> 33:17.204
I have thought
about how I'll react

33:17.371 --> 33:21.417
when I meet my friends
at the bottom of the cave.

33:21.583 --> 33:25.004
When you have to look them
in the eye again.

33:25.170 --> 33:29.633
But somehow you can
psych yourself up

33:29.842 --> 33:33.178
and think about
those things later.

33:40.561 --> 33:44.481
Diving is a very
psychological sport.

33:44.648 --> 33:50.779
It multiplies all your feelings,
your fears

33:50.946 --> 33:57.161
and having nerves of steel
makes up for a lot.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.792
The actual ice is underneath.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.630
It wasn't so thick, after all.

34:15.219 --> 34:20.434
When you have been through
such a traumatic experience,

34:20.601 --> 34:25.773
all the talk and everything
about the subject

34:27.149 --> 34:32.737
makes you really emotional.

34:38.702 --> 34:44.041
I never want to experience
anything like that again.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.138
We absolutely can't have
any more accidents.

34:58.305 --> 35:02.851
The rescuer becoming the victim
would be the worst case scenario.

35:04.228 --> 35:07.564
Can you hear me, Laura?
<i>- I hear you.</i>

35:07.731 --> 35:10.400
A hundred minutes from now.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.946
<i>Team two can leave
in 100 minutes?</i>

35:14.113 --> 35:17.241
That's right,
but hold on for a moment.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.952
We are making sure
that everything is ok.

35:20.119 --> 35:23.205
<i>Okay, let me know when.</i>

35:56.613 --> 35:59.324
See you on the other side.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.853
PLURA ENTRANCE

36:34.735 --> 36:37.571
STEINUGLEFLÅGET DRY CAVE

36:57.132 --> 37:00.510
This goes from down here.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.691
There was a rock slide.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.694
So the visibility
may be zero at first.

37:20.280 --> 37:24.034
What time is it?
- 3:47 pm.

37:24.201 --> 37:25.577
Okay.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.998
Don't go too fast.
I can't keep up with this scooter.

37:30.165 --> 37:33.669
I'll put it in second gear.
- That's good.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.296
All right.

38:55.751 --> 39:00.839
(Patrik:) Is that the scooter's rope?
(Sami:) Yeah.

39:20.901 --> 39:24.279
(Patrik:) There was nothing left.
(Kai:) Sorry?

39:24.446 --> 39:26.531
(Patrik:) No tanks left.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.618
(Kai:) I told you that Sami
will bring four!

39:29.785 --> 39:32.329
(Kai:) Sami will bring them.

39:35.040 --> 39:40.796
It takes extraordinary
peace of mind

39:41.755 --> 39:45.801
to slow your breathing down,
to calm yourself down.

39:46.510 --> 39:51.181
When you start breathing poorly,
it generates more carbon dioxide.

39:51.348 --> 39:54.684
You become less and less alert.

39:54.851 --> 40:00.315
When the situation goes far enough,
the diver becomes a passenger,

40:00.482 --> 40:06.405
and your diving partner is forced
to see the whole thing through.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.658
There's nothing you can do.

40:09.825 --> 40:12.411
It's Jani.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.130
Hi!

40:23.964 --> 40:25.674
Jani...

40:25.841 --> 40:28.301
Oh, shit.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.471
It really hurts.

40:32.514 --> 40:35.267
Ok, then.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.688
Fuck.
- Did it start at the end or earlier?

40:39.855 --> 40:42.899
I felt it a bit at six metres,

40:43.066 --> 40:46.361
but now it really started
when we came back up.

40:48.405 --> 40:53.577
It felt like my hand was
being hacked off with a blunt axe.

40:54.953 --> 40:59.082
This started out well...
- Not a strong start.

40:59.541 --> 41:03.378
Just take it easy and
breathe in some oxygen.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.965
I'll arrange a ride
and more oxygen,

41:07.132 --> 41:11.553
and we'll see if we have to
take you somewhere else.

41:17.851 --> 41:21.771
Laura had signs
of decompression sickness.

41:21.938 --> 41:25.817
For a moment I thought
we are totally fucked.

41:25.984 --> 41:29.571
I was thinking about
how this would turn out.

41:29.738 --> 41:33.116
I started thinking,
"What the fuck are we going to do?"

41:33.283 --> 41:36.286
Can she even sit in the car

41:36.453 --> 41:39.831
if we have to get her
out of here?

41:39.998 --> 41:45.629
If she had needed a chopper it
would've jeopardized the operation.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.008
This is not good.

42:39.558 --> 42:42.644
(Kai:) Where are you?

42:54.364 --> 42:57.492
(Kai:) Where are you?

43:01.288 --> 43:05.125
(Kai:) What the fuck
are you doing there!

43:27.772 --> 43:32.485
No one should dive down there
if it doesn't feel right.

43:32.652 --> 43:38.950
You don't only put
yourself at risk, but others too.

43:52.422 --> 43:58.470
Recurring accidents have
made me question

43:58.970 --> 44:02.349
whether I even enjoy this sport.

44:02.515 --> 44:06.936
I really want to dive, but I have
become increasingly concerned

44:07.103 --> 44:11.066
about the friends I dive with.

44:13.318 --> 44:18.156
I just never want to
go through that again.

44:18.323 --> 44:22.160
I have slept so badly that

44:22.952 --> 44:28.833
I felt I wasn't in the
right state of mind to dive.

44:31.836 --> 44:39.803
SAMI AND PATRIK CONTINUE
DIVING WITHOUT KAI

44:48.770 --> 44:51.356
(Sami:) Let's continue.

44:59.864 --> 45:03.618
(Sami:) There is the first one.

45:32.564 --> 45:36.651
(Sami:) And there is the second Jari.

45:46.703 --> 45:49.622
(Sami:) Shall we start cutting?

45:50.373 --> 45:53.251
(Sami:) Cut that.
(Patrik:) Sorry?

45:53.418 --> 45:57.172
(Sami:) Cut off that rubber cord.

46:13.229 --> 46:15.940
(Sami:) Easy, easy.

46:17.025 --> 46:22.030
(Patrik:) Take the towing rope.
(Sami:) Okay.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.094
(Sami:) Guide it a bit.

46:45.261 --> 46:49.390
(Patrik:)
Wait, I am going to pass you.

46:54.687 --> 46:57.565
(Patrik:) It's pretty tight.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.693
(Sami:) Sorry?
(Patrik:) It's tight.

47:00.860 --> 47:03.863
(Patrik:) Did you get it?
(Sami:) No.

47:04.030 --> 47:08.117
(Patrik:) Shall we take a break?
(Sami:) Yes, let's do that.

47:21.214 --> 47:24.843
(Patrik:) Shall we go?
(Sami:) Yeah.

47:28.346 --> 47:31.224
(Sami:) Lift him up.

47:41.943 --> 47:44.863
(Sami:) Jani, over here!

47:45.029 --> 47:48.366
(Janne:)
How far away is Uusimäki?

47:48.533 --> 47:51.452
(Sami:) Only about 20 metres.

47:51.619 --> 47:54.789
(Janne:) Is he attached in any way?
(Sami:) No.

47:54.956 --> 47:58.084
(Janne:) So we can get him tomorrow?
(Sami:) Yes, yes.

47:58.251 --> 48:00.169
(Janne:) Okay.

48:00.336 --> 48:03.256
(Janne:)
I'm going back to the surface.

48:03.423 --> 48:06.759
(Sami:) Go ahead.
We'll be okay.

48:06.926 --> 48:09.846
(Patrik:) Don't take him
up to the surface.

48:10.013 --> 48:12.932
(Jani:) No, we won't.

48:33.369 --> 48:41.369
AFTER A 6 HOUR DIVE

48:44.714 --> 48:48.718
Way to go, Patte!
- All right!

48:56.851 --> 49:00.813
There is more light in here
than last time.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.733
It was pretty dark then.

49:03.900 --> 49:07.403
Can you walk all the way up?
- Yeah, yeah.

49:27.423 --> 49:31.719
Uusimäki was upside down,
with all the tanks strapped on.

49:31.886 --> 49:36.599
And Jari was there on his knees,
where I left him.

49:37.517 --> 49:40.728
Just like I remembered.

49:40.895 --> 49:44.524
This trip was a success.

49:45.066 --> 49:49.988
I have been waiting for this
for a couple of months.

49:50.947 --> 49:55.618
I haven't been able to
think of anything else

49:55.785 --> 50:00.540
than getting this dive done.
And now it is.

50:04.502 --> 50:07.255
We are almost there now.

50:11.092 --> 50:16.097
Do you think this night
will go a little bit better?

50:16.264 --> 50:18.933
Were you restless?

50:19.100 --> 50:22.729
I've been thinking about this
every single night

50:22.895 --> 50:25.565
since I walked out of here.
- Yeah.

50:25.732 --> 50:29.569
About when we would be able to
come back and get them out.

50:29.736 --> 50:33.823
We are well on the way now.
- We made it here.

50:36.117 --> 50:37.827
So...

50:37.994 --> 50:41.873
Tomorrow we'll go there
from here,

50:42.040 --> 50:45.209
take the second Jari with us
and come back up.

50:46.627 --> 50:49.130
Last time I didn't know

50:49.297 --> 50:52.967
whether to come back up
or stay down there.

50:54.260 --> 50:58.389
I'm ready to go,
but I'll wait for Sami.

50:58.556 --> 51:02.351
If you're waiting,
should we all go together?

51:02.560 --> 51:06.397
Sami and I were talking
during decompression.

51:06.564 --> 51:09.484
He asked if Kaitsu
is diving tomorrow.

51:09.650 --> 51:13.654
My guess is that Kaitsu will
never dive with us again.

51:13.821 --> 51:18.743
I saw it in his eyes
this morning.

51:18.910 --> 51:23.081
Normally he never speaks,
but this morning he said

51:23.247 --> 51:25.958
that he really
doesn't want to dive.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.628
It's good that he said it.
- Yes, sure.

51:28.795 --> 51:31.589
If he had started
falling apart down there...

51:31.756 --> 51:35.051
We all would've been screwed.

51:36.511 --> 51:40.973
I could take a day off on Wednesday
because I'm so old.

51:41.557 --> 51:45.061
That's the first time you've said it.
Usually it's me.

51:45.228 --> 51:48.231
But you were serious.
I'm just joking.

51:48.397 --> 51:52.819
You must really be old if you're realizing it yourself.
- I'm not old.

51:52.985 --> 51:57.365
See, you really have a problem with it.
- Yes, I do.

51:58.449 --> 52:01.619
Once you hit 40, it's all downhill.

52:01.786 --> 52:06.207
I never thought I'd live to 30.
And look what happened.

52:13.297 --> 52:16.717
That was a pretty
long dive, too.

52:17.135 --> 52:21.556
Is there anything warm to drink?
- Yes.

52:22.181 --> 52:24.684
Cup of noodles?

52:24.851 --> 52:27.979
Yes, noodles are good.

52:31.232 --> 52:33.943
This was a fucking good day.
- Yeah.

52:34.110 --> 52:39.198
I was really careful going through
all the tight spots.

52:39.699 --> 52:43.286
We should always do
extra dives.

52:43.452 --> 52:47.498
Not like what we usually do -
going straight to the end.

52:47.665 --> 52:51.085
Like the last time
we came here.

52:51.252 --> 52:55.840
If we had done a practice run then,
things would've been different.

52:56.007 --> 52:59.760
It was totally our own fault.

53:05.558 --> 53:10.688
Now that we know the deal,
the next dive should be quick.

53:36.088 --> 53:40.551
Way to go, guys!
- We can call it a day.

53:40.968 --> 53:43.054
You bet.

54:04.450 --> 54:08.829
We felt so great after the
successful dive on Monday.

54:08.996 --> 54:13.918
In many ways it went
better than we expected.

54:14.085 --> 54:19.298
Even though you try to avoid
being lulled into thinking

54:19.465 --> 54:24.887
the next dive will be easy,
that's kind of what happened.

54:25.304 --> 54:29.600
You should never expect
that a dive will go well.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.687
Because then it never does.

54:35.022 --> 54:41.654
I guess the traumatic memories
will fade with time.

54:43.072 --> 54:47.159
Or you learn to live with them.

54:48.119 --> 54:52.581
If something happens to me,
what would happen to my family?

54:52.748 --> 54:56.627
Those all might be reasons

54:56.794 --> 55:01.007
to possibly stop diving.

55:06.262 --> 55:10.099
I guess we are ready to go.

55:13.644 --> 55:18.024
I am not too excited.
- Yeah, I bet.

55:18.190 --> 55:22.653
I'll stay on the surface.
- Yes I heard.

55:23.863 --> 55:27.033
Nothing wrong with that.

55:27.825 --> 55:33.164
You shouldn't go if
you feel down about it.

55:33.331 --> 55:36.542
So we have about 90 minutes?

55:37.084 --> 55:41.297
Should we take the stuff
down there?

55:42.548 --> 55:46.135
So that everything is ready.

55:57.646 --> 56:02.610
I'll check what we need to
check for Uusimäki.

56:02.943 --> 56:06.989
Mainly where he was
breathing from, the pressures.

56:07.198 --> 56:11.202
I'll leave the scooter
on the other side?

56:11.410 --> 56:14.705
And then...
- We'll come with our scooter.

56:14.872 --> 56:19.627
You can probably start to swim
when you reach the slope.

56:19.794 --> 56:24.757
I can check if the narrow spot
is good, it's not far from Jari.

56:24.924 --> 56:27.510
No, only about 20 metres.

56:27.676 --> 56:30.554
I can stay there to pull him.

56:30.721 --> 56:34.266
Any way you like.
We'll get him easily.

56:34.433 --> 56:37.395
You'll come with the scooter

56:38.354 --> 56:40.523
and I'll film.

56:40.689 --> 56:44.902
Then we'll start cutting.
Should we cut... these?

56:45.069 --> 56:47.613
Cut all the straps
so it drops off.

56:47.780 --> 56:51.534
The shoulder straps, belly strap...

56:51.700 --> 56:54.370
That should come off
just by pulling.

56:54.537 --> 57:00.418
Yesterday we were on
full throttle or in third gear.

57:00.584 --> 57:06.257
If he seems not to be moving,
try slowing down and then revving it.

57:06.424 --> 57:10.761
You'll hear a call from behind.
- Yell "stop"...

57:10.928 --> 57:13.931
Or "full steam, go!"

57:14.098 --> 57:17.643
"Go" is probably clearer.
- Go or stop.

57:22.648 --> 57:26.986
Oh, fuck! -<i>"Kuusamo,</i>
<i>taas kutsuu mua Kuusamo..."</i>

57:27.153 --> 57:31.198
Ok, off I go.
- Do well.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.909
Bye!

57:50.509 --> 57:54.054
(Sami:) Was it there?
(Patrik:) Was it this one?

57:54.221 --> 57:58.684
(Patrik:) Well... Yes, over there.
(Sami:) Yeah.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.371
(Sami:) OK.

58:25.336 --> 58:27.713
(Sami:) It's tight.

58:27.922 --> 58:30.841
(Patrik:) Fuck!

58:33.135 --> 58:36.096
(Sami:) Wait, wait!

58:50.277 --> 58:54.073
(Sami:) The cave is collapsing!

58:56.909 --> 58:59.870
(Sami:) OK, go!

59:07.962 --> 59:10.506
(Sami:) Pull, pull!

59:12.341 --> 59:15.469
(Sami:)
Pull, pull. Go, go!

59:26.063 --> 59:29.775
(Patrik:) Fucking hell!
(Sami:) Pull, pull.

59:33.946 --> 59:36.782
Kaitsu?
- Yes.

59:45.124 --> 59:47.835
What time is it?
- It's ten minutes to.

59:48.002 --> 59:51.505
Should we go now?
- In a couple of minutes.

59:51.672 --> 59:54.383
There is no rush,
whenever you are ready.

59:54.550 --> 59:57.928
Janne, do you have everything?
- Yeah.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:31.337
(Patrik:) Goddamn, that was heavy.
(Sami:) Yeah, it was.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:35.382
(Patrik:) He was so fucking positive
that I cut the suit,

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:37.593
but it didn't help.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:42.681
(Patrik:) I told Jani to attach
the tanks to the cord

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.768
so that it would
pull him down.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:50.064
(Patrik:) But he was in a hurry to
leave and he didn't hear me.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.905
(Veli:) Pull, pull!

01:00:58.364 --> 01:01:01.241
Wait!

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:08.290
(Janne:)
That will add some weight to you.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:21.762
(Janne:) Let's put one of those
heavy tanks on the waist rope.

01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:24.515
Here, at the end of the rope.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.856
(Veli:) Hey, stop!

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:38.737
Hey, hey!
He is drifting away!

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:42.032
(Veli:) Come down quickly!
(Mika:) Sorry?

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:46.328
(Veli:) Come down!
Grab that rope!

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:43.969
AFTER A 5 HOUR DIVE

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.306
Did they get him up?

01:02:47.473 --> 01:02:51.143
Is the rope here?
- Did they get him up?

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:54.521
Yes, he's under the brim.
- So, both are up?

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:56.106
Yes.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:03:01.028
He's 30 kg more positive
than Huotarinen.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:05.949
I almost fainted a few times.
- We had to take a few breaks.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:10.204
Fasten it under your arm
and secure it there.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.706
Let's put it there
so that he's nearby.

01:03:12.873 --> 01:03:15.250
Yes, let's put Uusimäki there.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:20.214
Try to hold it tight.
So the knot won't slip off.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.884
Vesa.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.226
Way to go, guys!

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:12.432
I gave it all I had.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:20.107
All in?
- Yes.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:24.611
I am totally exhausted.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:29.366
What an easy little job.
- Yeah.

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.707
It feels like I am
totally out of shape.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:41.420
Let me dismantle it.
- You can unzip this.

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:46.425
Has Kaitsu already
carried all the gear up?

01:04:46.592 --> 01:04:49.636
Most of it is
at the foot of the hill.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:53.932
I figured he has been
working his butt off.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:57.978
No, he was outside.
- Is he totally worn out?

01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:00.147
He's probably okay now.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:03.275
It has been tough for him.
- Yes.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:09.031
I was thinking during
the break that

01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:13.493
if there was a problem and
I took the wrong regulator

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.371
that would have been it.

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:21.001
I couldn't continue.
- Where did it happen?

01:05:21.168 --> 01:05:23.003
At 00 metres.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:28.550
I just held on to the rock
and breathe as deeply as possible.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:35.098
I need to get my lungs fixed
and start rehab.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:39.353
Detox, not rehabilitation?

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.524
Hello, hello.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:50.072
Howdy!

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:03.710
Can you take my fin?

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:08.632
Where shall I put this device?
- All the way up, if you can.

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:11.343
Show the way, Vesa.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:15.973
The surface manager will go ahead,
I can give you a push.

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:20.852
Don't.
- Okay, no more then?

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.689
"Don't touch me, God damn it!"

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:28.235
I'm not phobic, but
get your hands off my butt.

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:32.489
I might as well carry these
all the way up.

01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:36.410
Patte, did you notice?
The cave collapsed.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.120
Yes, I did.

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:41.498
You'll be able to see
in the footage

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:45.585
I was cutting the straps
and a rock fell on me.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:50.465
I was like: "What was that?
Now the cave is collapsing!"

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:56.013
I tried to fling it off and
kept going. Eventually it did.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:07:02.269
I guess we have to
start carrying the gear up.

01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:09.609
I think that the gear down there

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:14.698
can stay as a memorial.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:21.371
If someone goes there, or...

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:26.752
when it is
permitted to go there

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:33.133
it can be a reminder of what
a challenging place this is.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:44.436
My appetite is much bigger
than when we first got here.

01:07:44.603 --> 01:07:48.190
I'm not sure if it's all the
carrying or something else.

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:51.610
I guess it's something else.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:55.405
Let's hope
it's easier to sleep, too.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.119
Does Maria know?
Has anyone spoken to her today?

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:07.626
I promised to let Uusimäki's family
know that everything is okay.

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:11.797
It's tough to have to be taken
out of here by your friends,

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:14.341
but if no one else can...

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:21.515
It has been tough for us
to get our friends back.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.104
On the other hand, this
is a good tribute to them.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:34.944
If it was me,
it would be amazing to have

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:39.116
an escort on your final journey.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:43.120
Your friends coming to
get you from down there.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.872
Indeed.

01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:26.328
Hello. Is this Bjørn Einar Bjørnå?

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.332
<i>Yes.</i>
- Hello and good morning.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:33.377
This is Sami Paakkarinen calling.

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:37.340
I am calling from Plurdalen.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:44.055
And I had the knowledge
that you were the

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:49.102
investigator in the diving accident,
which happened

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.813
last month in Plurdalen.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:54.399
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

01:09:54.608 --> 01:10:02.608
We have news for you that
we have recovered the bodies up.

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:06.536
<i>Okay.</i>

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:12.042
We have been running
a project for five days, and

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:17.797
the bodies are now up
in the Steinugleflåget dry cave.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:22.552
<i>Both of the bodies?</i>
- Both of the bodies, yes.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:31.645
<i>Are you at the farm in Plurdalen?
Are you calling from there?</i>

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:35.690
Yes, I am calling from
the farm in Plurdalen.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:37.734
<i>I understand.</i>

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:42.864
We also took one
of the scooters of the victims,

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:47.118
one wrist computer
and one tank up with us.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.664
So we have those for you

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:54.626
and then we have
a video of the recovery.

01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:58.088
So we want to give them to you.

01:10:58.255 --> 01:11:01.591
<i>So you have taken both bodies up?</i>

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.927
Yes, we have.

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:08.932
<i>I will give a message to my chief</i>

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:14.062
<i>and then, one police
will contact you. Is that okay?</i>

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:17.524
Yes, it is okay.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:27.200
What, what, what...
Both?

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:30.287
Both? Yes, yes.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:40.630
Shall we bag them?
- I don't have a strong opinion about it.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:44.301
I thought we should leave
them in the water, but...

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:47.637
I am positive that
we should bag them.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:57.022
But if Torsten is opposed to it
for some reason, then...

01:11:57.605 --> 01:12:00.442
then we won't.

01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:05.113
Then we won't do it.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.075
I wish we knew how long
the officials will take.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.536
That could help us decide.

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:15.832
We have packed
almost everything.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:20.754
We'd like to hold a moment
of silence in the evening.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.175
I'd like to put them in body bags.
- Is that what you have decided?

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:29.429
Yes, but I understand
that you think it's a bad idea.

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:34.100
Well, no.
You know best.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.020
The bags are airtight

01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:40.065
and can be closed
with a zipper.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.275
I use them at work.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:46.154
Do as you see best.

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:49.699
We would like to do that.
- Do that then.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.659
It's agreed then.

01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:55.080
At some point during
the evening then.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:59.959
Thank you to everyone
who has helped us.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:04.547
I hope we can return the favour.

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:10.053
Contact us
if you come to Finland.

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:15.016
We are never
going to visit you, Patrik!

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:18.228
Okay, see you
in the summer then!

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:22.649
I'll come to your Finnish sauna!
- That can be arranged.

01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:38.790
It would have haunted me
for a long time

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:43.711
if we hadn't come back
to dive there again.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:50.593
Everyone understands how important
it is for the families

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.098
to bring our friends back
home to be buried.

01:13:55.265 --> 01:14:00.019
So there is a place
to bring flowers.

01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:22.459
Thank you, everyone,
for taking part in this.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:26.880
Now we can bring
both Jaris back home.

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:31.593
Many thanks on my behalf too.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:36.806
This wouldn't have been
possible without you.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.861
Time heals all wounds.
Maybe in this case too.

01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:54.032
But, I don't see myself

01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:57.243
as a hero in any way.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:01.581
We just brought
our friends back home.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:45.875
481 and 483 on the way,
with a strength of three.

01:15:56.511 --> 01:16:00.682
We can begin.
Good Monday morning, everyone.

01:16:01.099 --> 01:16:05.853
Before the extended meeting
of the Executive Board,

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:09.649
we have an accolade to hand out.

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:13.736
We can begin the rehearsal.

01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:16.364
But not quite yet.

01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:19.409
Fortunately,
we didn't drink yesterday.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:22.412
Too much.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:29.335
The retrieval of the victims was
an extremely challenging process.

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:35.258
Neither the Norwegian nor the British
divers could accomplish it.

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:40.179
It was also a demonstration of real
professional commitment,

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:44.267
and his respect for
brotherhood.

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:47.020
Sami, what would
your motto be?

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:51.316
I couldn't think of anything before,
so I guess I won't now either.

01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:54.360
Can you come up
with a catchy one?

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:59.616
How about what you said
before the first deep dive?

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:03.077
"See you on the other side."

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:07.582
What is this?
- An olive.

01:17:09.334 --> 01:17:12.670
Did you like it?
You didn't?

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:15.632
It's still in your mouth.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:18.801
Just spit it into the napkin.

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:27.644
In recognition, the President
of Finland has awarded you

01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:34.233
the First Class Medal
of the White Rose of Finland.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:47.789
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:49.290
Action!

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:53.419
"If you can leave something
for tomorrow, do it tomorrow."

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:58.758
Thank you.
And Sami, your turn.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.012
When?

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:06.933
Just a moment.
Look into the camera.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.185
Action!

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:14.524
"Never leave anything
until tomorrow."

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:18.111
I'm not good at
giving speeches, but...

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:21.280
The way I see it,
we had no choice.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.992
We had to get our friends back,
no matter what.

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:29.997
We took a little risk
and went to get them.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:33.042
I could never have
done it alone.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:37.880
I had a great team.
They should all get medals too.

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:40.425
But...

01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:44.971
I guess it's up to someone else
to apply for them.

01:18:45.138 --> 01:18:47.598
That's all.

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:58.151
POZO AZUL, SPAIN

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:07.577
If I can't dive anymore,
it will leave quite a void.

01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:13.207
All of my friends
are involved in diving.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:19.422
I don't want to think about it
before going into the water again,

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:23.259
to see if diving still feels good.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:30.975
Or if I have some fears or issues
that are keeping me from diving.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:40.777
I don't know if this accident
has changed me in any way.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:46.741
Would it help my family if I quit
and found something else?

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:50.995
They know that I have to dive.

01:19:51.204 --> 01:19:56.793
My wife asked the girls
if I was still allowed to dive.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.129
They said: "He has to",

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:04.258
because he is so mad
when he can't."

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:09.096
I do want to dive.
It's what I'm good at.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:13.059
It's what I enjoy doing.
That's the way I see it.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:24.111
At times it's hard to justify
going somewhere to dive.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:31.035
You have to explain a lot of things.
Like what we're doing and the risks.

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:35.706
It's annoying having to
explain it so much.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:39.502
On the other hand,
I do owe them an explanation.

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:46.717
It would be tough to tell them
I'm returning to that place again.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:52.181
That would be
unfair on my family.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:56.644
Time will tell what I am
going to do with this.

01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:06.779
I can see that someone else
has also zipped this.

01:21:07.572 --> 01:21:09.949
There you go.
- Thank you.

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:22.712
If you have to ask
why I have to go there,

01:21:22.879 --> 01:21:26.299
you probably wouldn't
understand the answer either.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:31.929
It's hard to explain to someone
who doesn't know this sport

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:38.227
why we go to places that are
so hostile towards humans.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:43.900
No matter how hard I try to
articulate or explain it,

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:51.157
you will never understand
why I have to go there.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:30.529
Patte!
Be careful out there.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:06.190
THE NORWEGIAN POLICE

01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:10.861
DECIDED NOT TO PRESS CHARGES
AGAINST THE DIVERS

01:23:12.238 --> 01:23:19.745
IN MEMORY OF JARI HUOTARINEN
AND JARI UUSIMÄKI
