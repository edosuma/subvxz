THERE WE GO.

00:33.399 --> 00:35.166
CARRIE, HI,
IT'S DEBRA

00:35.234 --> 00:37.002
FROM MURPHY, BLATT,
AND SHERMAN CALLING.

00:37.069 --> 00:39.437
JUST FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR
INTERVIEW WITH US TODAY.

00:39.505 --> 00:41.356
IT WAS WONDERFUL
MEETING YOU.

00:41.424 --> 00:43.208
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT LOOKS LIKE

00:43.276 --> 00:45.410
WE'RE GONNA GO WITH
SOMEONE ELSE FOR THE JOB,

00:45.477 --> 00:48.679
BUT, UH, HEY, LISTEN, I RAN OUT AT LUNCH

00:48.747 --> 00:51.499
AND I BOUGHT A PAIR OF
THOSE GREAT SHOES YOU HAD ON.

00:51.567 --> 00:55.320
I LOVE THEM. THANKS
FOR THE TIP. OK, BYE.

00:57.489 --> 01:01.809
I JUST HAD
THE BEST INTERVIEW.

01:01.877 --> 01:04.328
I MET WITH ONE OF
THESE FEMALE PARTNERS, OK?

01:04.396 --> 01:06.531
AND WE TOTALLY HIT IT OFF.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.366
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS
FIRM BETTER THAN MY OLD FIRM,

01:08.434 --> 01:11.035
SO SCREW THEM
FOR FIRING ME, YOU KNOW?

01:12.171 --> 01:14.739
I GUESS EVERYTHING JUST
HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

01:14.807 --> 01:17.825
YOU KNOW WHEN I KNEW
I REALLY NAILED IT?

01:17.893 --> 01:19.594
WHEN SHE SAID
SHE LOVED MY SHOES

01:19.662 --> 01:21.429
AND ASKED ME
WHERE I GOT THEM.

01:21.497 --> 01:23.180
OH, THERE'S
A MESSAGE!

01:23.248 --> 01:25.633
UH, PHONE BAD.
PHONE BAD.

01:25.701 --> 01:27.385
WHY? DID SHE CALL?
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

01:29.187 --> 01:32.156
WELL, SHE DID LOVE
THE SHOES.

01:32.224 --> 01:33.675
I DIDN'T GET THE JOB?

01:33.742 --> 01:35.343
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON NOW.

01:35.411 --> 01:36.878
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

01:36.945 --> 01:38.946
YOU JUST SAID EVERYTHING
HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

01:39.014 --> 01:41.782
COME ON. WE BOTH KNOW
THAT THAT'S CRAP.

01:41.850 --> 01:43.218
I'M SORRY, DARLING.

01:43.285 --> 01:45.687
I TAKE IT THINGS DIDN'T
WORK OUT WITH YOUR INTERVIEW.

01:45.754 --> 01:47.021
NO.

01:47.089 --> 01:49.056
I TRUST YOU'LL GIVE ME
AMPLE NOTICE

01:49.124 --> 01:51.892
IF I NEED TO MAKE
OTHER LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.395
DAD, DON'T WORRY. WE'RE
NOT GONNA KICK YOU OUT

01:54.463 --> 01:56.497
NO MATTER HOW TIGHT
MONEY GETS.

01:56.565 --> 01:57.632
MM-HMM.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.234
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
TO GET THAT IN WRITING?

02:00.302 --> 02:01.486
ARTHUR, GO!

02:01.553 --> 02:03.204
MM-HMM.

02:03.272 --> 02:06.307
I'VE BEEN ON, LIKE,
5,000 JOB INTERVIEWS.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.809
I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE.

02:08.877 --> 02:12.113
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
MIGHT CHEER YOU UP.

02:12.181 --> 02:15.683
WOULD SOMEONE LIKE A LITTLE
MAN-BREAST PUPPET THEATER?

02:21.490 --> 02:24.209
COCO, WHY YOU SO UPSET?

02:25.610 --> 02:27.511
COME OVER HERE.

02:27.579 --> 02:30.648
I CAN'T QUITE-A MAKE IT
OVER THERE.

02:30.716 --> 02:33.218
I'M NOT HUGE ENOUGH.

02:33.285 --> 02:35.653
YOU MUST EAT MORE CHEESE.

02:38.974 --> 02:41.542
IS THIS NIPPLE ON?

02:45.948 --> 02:47.214
YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH
I COULD DO?

02:47.366 --> 02:49.968
I WISH I COULD JUST FORGET THIS
WHOLE JOB SEARCH THING FOR A WHILE

02:50.035 --> 02:52.570
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
FOCUS ON ME.

02:52.637 --> 02:53.321
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:53.388 --> 02:54.539
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

02:54.606 --> 02:56.741
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 17.

02:56.808 --> 02:59.477
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS I
WOULD DO IF I HAD THE TIME.

02:59.545 --> 03:01.128
LIKE WHAT?

03:01.196 --> 03:03.197
<i>LIKE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO READ THE GREAT GATSBY,</i>

03:03.266 --> 03:05.584
AND I WANTED TO, LIKE,
REALLY LEARN HOW TO COOK.

03:05.651 --> 03:07.819
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS
AROUND HERE I WANTED TO DO.

03:07.886 --> 03:09.754
AND, OH! YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WANTED TO START

03:09.822 --> 03:12.290
MY OWN BUSINESS, MAKING
DESIGNER CELL PHONE CASES?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.426
YOU KNOW, DECORATING
THEM WITH VINTAGE, UM,

03:14.493 --> 03:15.727
FABRIC AND FUR?

03:15.794 --> 03:17.596
WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU
THINK I'D BE GOOD AT THAT?

03:17.663 --> 03:19.797
I'VE NEVER PERSONALLY
SEEN YOU WORK WITH FUR,

03:19.865 --> 03:21.899
BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC.

03:21.967 --> 03:22.983
SO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:23.051 --> 03:25.520
YOU THINK I COULD JUST
TAKE SOME TIME FOR ME

03:25.587 --> 03:27.689
AND, YOU KNOW,
JUST FIND MYSELF?

03:27.756 --> 03:31.793
YOU KNOW WHAT? YEAH, I
THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT.

03:31.860 --> 03:33.595
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

03:33.663 --> 03:36.631
WE GOT ENOUGH SAVINGS, AND
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SEVERANCE.

03:36.699 --> 03:39.834
OH, MY GOD, DOUG. THIS IS-THANK
YOU. IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

03:39.902 --> 03:42.437
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT WOULD BE GREAT.

03:42.504 --> 03:44.539
IF YOU WOULD INTRODUCE
ME AND LEFTY

03:44.606 --> 03:46.958
TO YOUR
LADY-BREAST FRIENDS.

03:48.827 --> 03:52.864
WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME
ON! I GOT BEERS IN THE VAN!

03:57.185 --> 03:58.619
HEY.

03:58.687 --> 04:00.137
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT COFFEE MAKER?

04:00.205 --> 04:04.075
AH, THE THING BROKE
- THE GLASS THING THAT HOLDS THE COFFEE.

04:04.143 --> 04:05.877
THE CARAFE?

04:05.945 --> 04:09.614
OK, WE'RE IN AMERICA.
SPEAK ENGLISH.

04:09.681 --> 04:11.749
ANYWAY, YOU GOTTA GET A NEW
ONE THAT FITS THAT, ALL RIGHT?

04:11.817 --> 04:12.917
OK, I'LL
TAKE CARE OF IT.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.319
GREAT, THANKS.

04:14.386 --> 04:15.953
WHAT'S THIS, HONEY?

04:18.658 --> 04:19.957

04:22.495 --> 04:23.661
NICE. YOU WANT ME
TO GROPE YOU

04:23.729 --> 04:25.646
SO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE ON THE SUBWAY?

04:25.714 --> 04:27.765
YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR
FILL OF THAT LAST NIGHT

04:27.833 --> 04:29.701
WHEN YOU THOUGHT
I WAS SLEEPIN'?

04:34.673 --> 04:38.376
I'M NOT PROUD OF LAST
NIGHT. CAN WE MOVE ON?

04:38.444 --> 04:39.861
HONEY, I LOVE THIS.

04:39.928 --> 04:42.230
I JUST FEEL SO ENERGIZED. LOOK AT THIS.

04:42.297 --> 04:43.665
I GOT MY BOOK,

04:43.733 --> 04:46.167
AND I GOT ALL OUR
OLD PICTURES OUT,

04:46.235 --> 04:48.135

CROSS-REFERENCE THEM

04:48.203 --> 04:49.987
WITH MY OLD
DAY PLANNER

04:50.055 --> 04:53.658
TO GET THE RIGHT DATES ON
THE BACK. HOW GREAT IS THAT?

04:53.725 --> 04:56.193
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING A DOUG
HEFFERNAN WOULD SINK HIS TEETH INTO,

04:56.261 --> 04:58.630
BUT YOU GO TO TOWN.

04:58.697 --> 05:00.631

05:00.699 --> 05:02.249
OK, BYE, HONEY.

05:09.592 --> 05:12.427
OH, "DR. PHIL CONFRONTS
GIANT BABIES."

06:51.893 --> 06:54.796
GET HIM READY
FOR HIS TRIP.

06:54.863 --> 06:55.963
THERE SHE IS.

06:57.849 --> 06:59.300
OK.

07:08.911 --> 07:10.611
HEY, MAN. DIDN'T SEE YOU THIS MORNING.

07:10.679 --> 07:13.164
YEAH, I WAS A LITTLE LATE.
I WENT RUNNING.

07:16.685 --> 07:18.286
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

07:18.353 --> 07:19.353

07:19.421 --> 07:21.038

ALL DAY?

07:21.106 --> 07:22.757
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN KELLY?

07:22.824 --> 07:25.393
I THINK ABOUT KELLY.

07:25.460 --> 07:28.529
I GUESS SHE, UH, GETS THE
KIDS READY IN THE MORNING,

07:28.597 --> 07:30.698
TAKES THEM TO SCHOOL,
RUNS SOME ERRANDS,

07:30.766 --> 07:32.633
MAKES DINNER,
THEN WE CRAWL INTO BED,

07:32.701 --> 07:35.903
AND USUALLY SOMETIME
DURING THE 11:00 NEWS

07:35.971 --> 07:38.072
SHE OPENS FOR BUSINESS.

07:38.139 --> 07:42.259
EVEN AFTER A FULL DAY LIKE
THAT, SHE OPENS FOR BUSINESS?!

07:42.327 --> 07:44.195
YOU DON'T EVEN
GOTTA BANG ON THE DOOR?!

07:44.262 --> 07:45.796
NO.

07:45.864 --> 07:47.548
SON OF A MOTHER!

07:47.616 --> 07:49.433
WHAT?

07:49.501 --> 07:50.835
CARRIE-
I MEAN, SHE'S HOME,

07:50.903 --> 07:53.738
AND SHE CAME UP WITH THIS WHOLE
PLAN ABOUT FINDING HERSELF,

07:53.806 --> 07:55.306
BUT SHE'S
NOT DOING ANYTHING.

07:55.374 --> 07:57.225
SHE MADE YOU
A PRETTY FINE-LOOKING LUNCH.

07:57.293 --> 07:59.477
I MADE IT!

07:59.545 --> 08:02.046
I WAS UP AT 6 A.M.
GRILLING FLANK STEAK

08:02.113 --> 08:04.982
JUST TO
CHEER MYSELF UP.

08:05.050 --> 08:09.103
C- CAN I HAVE A PIECE?

08:09.171 --> 08:10.054
YEAH.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.223
NOT ONLY IS SHE DOING
NOTHING DURING THE DAY,

08:12.290 --> 08:14.258
BUT THE OTHER NIGHT I TRIED
TO GET SOMETHING GOING,

08:14.326 --> 08:18.362
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS "SO TIRED
SHE COULDN'T THINK STRAIGHT."

08:18.430 --> 08:22.150
OK, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT THE
HELL ARE YOU SO TIRED FROM?

08:22.217 --> 08:24.285
AND SECOND, WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO THINK?

08:24.353 --> 08:27.255
IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE GOT A
RUBIK'S CUBE DOWN THERE.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.131
HEY, HONEY.
WHATCHA DOING?

08:37.198 --> 08:38.832
JUST MAKING

08:38.900 --> 08:40.701
OH, CAN I HAVE SOME?

08:44.105 --> 08:45.406

08:45.474 --> 08:47.975
I'D, UH, MAKE YOU
SOME COFFEE, BUT...

08:48.743 --> 08:52.129
THING'S
STILL BROKEN.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.348
DARLING, I'VE BEEN PERUSING
THE CLASSIFIEDS FOR YOU,

08:54.415 --> 08:56.517
AND I HAVE FOUND SOME
INTERESTING OPTIONS.

08:56.584 --> 09:01.489
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
DANCING EXOTICALLY?

09:01.556 --> 09:03.708
DAD, YOU WOULD
WANT YOUR OWN DAUGHTER

09:03.776 --> 09:06.177
TO STRIP NAKED
IN FRONT OF STRANGERS?

09:06.244 --> 09:07.128
YOU JUST SHUT DOWN.

09:07.195 --> 09:09.597
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
NOT EVEN THERE.

09:11.466 --> 09:12.900
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, HOL.

09:12.968 --> 09:13.901
ARTHUR,
READY FOR YOUR WALK?

09:13.969 --> 09:15.803
YES, AND
APROPOS TO NOTHING,

09:15.871 --> 09:18.506
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
A LONG-TERM HOUSEGUEST?

09:18.574 --> 09:20.908
WHY? ARE YOU
HAVING A PROBLEM?

09:20.976 --> 09:22.143
I'M NOT.

09:24.846 --> 09:25.880
CARRIE,
IS EVERYTHING-

09:25.948 --> 09:27.581
EVERYTHING IS FINE!

09:27.649 --> 09:30.885
DAD, I SAID WE'RE NOT GONNA KICK
YOU OUT ON THE STREET, ALL RIGHT?!

09:30.952 --> 09:34.221
THEN WHY WON'T YOU
PUT IT IN WRITING?!

09:34.289 --> 09:37.024
OK. WHO'S READY
FOR A WALK?

09:38.393 --> 09:40.011
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE DOING YOUR THING,

09:40.078 --> 09:42.046
SO, UH, I'M
JUST GONNA GET GOING.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.398
YEAH, I BETTER
GET ON MY STUFF, TOO.

09:44.466 --> 09:45.215
OK, BYE-BYE, NOW.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.400
BYE, HON.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.969
UH, SUPERVISOR? UH, WELL, MY-

10:20.685 --> 10:23.988
...A MAN WITH
NO EDUCATION TO MAKE A LIVING.

10:24.055 --> 10:26.557
NIGEL SAYS HE'S PROUD
OF HIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES,

10:26.624 --> 10:30.561
ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT HE'S
RECENTLY BECOME A SUCCESSFUL PIMP

10:30.628 --> 10:34.165
WITH A STABLE OF PROSTITUTES
WHO SELL THEIR BODIES FOR HIM.

10:34.232 --> 10:37.718
SOMETHING HIS MOM
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT.

10:37.786 --> 10:39.253
GOOD DAY.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.100
DOUG,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:53.168 --> 10:56.804
JUST WAITING FOR JUDGE HATCHETT
TO HAND DOWN HER DECISION.

10:56.872 --> 10:58.105
DOUG!

10:58.173 --> 11:00.040
I'M COMING AROUND.

11:03.378 --> 11:04.745
WOULD YOU PLEASE
EXPLAIN TO ME

11:04.813 --> 11:08.232
WHY YOU WERE OUTSIDE SPYING
ON ME LIKE A 2-YEAR-OLD?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.168
UH, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF
2-YEAR-OLD SPIES OUT THERE.

11:11.236 --> 11:12.753
AND THE ONLY REASON
I'M CHECKING UP ON YOU

11:12.821 --> 11:15.055
IS BECAUSE I JUST DON'T GET
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE ALL DAY!

11:15.123 --> 11:16.491
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS.

11:16.558 --> 11:17.542
NO, I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA DO,

11:17.609 --> 11:19.260
BUT I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.379
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA PUT
TOGETHER A PHOTO ALBUM, RIGHT?

11:21.446 --> 11:23.314
WELL, HERE WE ARE
IN PHILADELPHIA.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.450
AND... BLACK!

11:26.518 --> 11:29.270
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THESE
PICTURES JUST SITTING HERE.

11:29.337 --> 11:30.805

11:30.872 --> 11:32.106
LOOK. LOOK AT THIS.

11:32.174 --> 11:34.508
THERE'S CHOW MEIN
ON MY FACE.

11:34.575 --> 11:36.343
THAT'S
IN THE PICTURE.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.680
WELL,
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

11:39.747 --> 11:41.081
WHAT ABOUT
THE CELL PHONE CASES

11:41.150 --> 11:42.683
AND ALL THIS READING
YOU'RE GONNA DO?

11:42.751 --> 11:43.784
THE GREAT GATSBY-

11:43.852 --> 11:46.020
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHY HE'S SO GREAT YET?

11:46.087 --> 11:48.623
WHAT ARE YOU, MY BOSS?
I HAVE TO PROVE TO YOU

11:48.690 --> 11:50.158
ALL THE WORK
THAT I'VE BEEN DOING?

11:50.225 --> 11:51.992
WHAT? I HAVE TO ASK YOU
FOR A BATHROOM KEY

11:52.060 --> 11:53.794
NEXT TIME I HAVE TO GO?

11:53.862 --> 11:55.729
JUST HELP ME
UNDERSTAND THIS.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.298
OK, HUMOR ME HERE.

11:57.365 --> 12:01.035
OK, TELL ME WHAT YOU DID
YESTERDAY, BESIDES WATCH TV

12:01.103 --> 12:03.537
<i>AND PLAY THE BEGINNING
OF THE ROSE ON THE PIANO.</i>

12:03.605 --> 12:04.771
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM DONE TALKING TO YOU.

12:04.839 --> 12:06.273
THIS CONVERSATION
IS OVER.

12:06.341 --> 12:08.209
OH, I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN THIS IS OVER,

12:08.276 --> 12:09.377
BECAUSE I'M STILL TALKING.
WELL, GOOD.

12:09.444 --> 12:10.610
HAVE FUN
TALKING TO YOURSELF.

12:17.286 --> 12:18.519
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:18.586 --> 12:22.189
I AM TESTING PENS TO
SEE WHICH ONES ARE DRY.

12:24.959 --> 12:26.860
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

12:28.730 --> 12:29.763
LOOK, DOUG,

12:29.831 --> 12:31.565
I KNOW IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE I'VE GOTTEN

12:31.632 --> 12:33.267
A LOT OF WORK DONE
AROUND HERE,

12:33.335 --> 12:35.002
BUT I-I
HAVE BEEN THINKING

12:35.070 --> 12:37.755
ABOUT WHAT MY CELL PHONES
ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE, OK?

12:37.823 --> 12:40.007
AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
HOW TO ARRANGE THOSE PICTURES.

12:40.075 --> 12:41.275
YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT?
THINKING?

12:41.343 --> 12:42.843
YEAH, I HEARD OF THINKING.

12:42.911 --> 12:44.028
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.262
YOU EVER HEARD OF DINNER?!

12:45.330 --> 12:46.697
WHAT?

12:46.765 --> 12:49.116
YEAH. YOU THINK ONE DAY HERE
WHILE YOU'RE DEEP IN THOUGHT,

12:49.184 --> 12:53.120
YOU MIGHT JUST BUMP INTO THE STOVE
AND ACCIDENTALLY COOK ME SOMETHING?!

12:53.188 --> 12:57.774
OH, SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL
ABOUT. FOOD. THAT'S A SHOCKER.

12:57.842 --> 12:59.644
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WOULDN'T BE ABOUT FOOD

12:59.711 --> 13:00.978
IF I COULD GET MYSELF
A HOT CUP OF COFFEE,

13:01.046 --> 13:02.613
BUT THE COFFEEMAKER'S
BEEN SITTING IN THE DOORWAY

13:02.681 --> 13:04.548
FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS!

13:04.616 --> 13:06.250
YOU THINK YOU COULD
FIND YOURSELF A HALF HOUR

13:06.317 --> 13:09.886
TO GO OUT AND GET
A NEW GLASS PITCHER THING?!

13:09.954 --> 13:13.707
OK, YOU STILL CAN'T REMEMBER
THE WORD "CARAFE"?

13:13.775 --> 13:16.611
I'M NOT CALLING IT THAT.
IT SOUNDS FRUITY!

13:16.678 --> 13:18.112
WELL, YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP OUT

13:18.180 --> 13:20.147
BY PUTTING A LID
BACK ON THE PEN HERE?

13:20.215 --> 13:21.949
THESE ARE ALL DRY,
THANK YOU.

13:22.017 --> 13:25.102
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE UPSET, OK?

13:25.170 --> 13:26.603
AND YOU THINK
I'M THE BAD GUY HERE,

13:26.671 --> 13:29.356
BUT DON'T YOU FIND IT
THE SLIGHTEST BIT ODD

13:29.424 --> 13:32.025
THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR SOMEONE
TO WALK YOUR FATHER

13:32.094 --> 13:33.660
WHILE YOU'RE
HOME ON THE COUCH

13:33.728 --> 13:37.331
WITH
FULLY-FUNCTIONING LEGS?

13:39.167 --> 13:42.636
I AM FINDING MYSELF.

13:42.704 --> 13:43.487
OK, WELL,
LET ME HELP YOU.

13:43.638 --> 13:45.272
HERE YOU ARE!
RIGHT IN THERE!

13:45.340 --> 13:46.924
THAT'S YOU! I FOUND YOU!

13:46.992 --> 13:48.409
NOW MAKE SOME CHICKEN!

13:53.131 --> 13:55.266
SO HOW ARE THINGS
AT THE SENIOR CENTER?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.034
YOU EVER FIGURE OUT
WHO STOLE ALL THAT APPLESAUCE?

13:57.102 --> 13:58.119
CAN WE DROP
THE CHITCHAT

13:58.186 --> 13:59.670
AND ADDRESS
THE HUGE ELEPHANT

13:59.737 --> 14:01.872
THAT'S
IN THE ROOM HERE?

14:01.939 --> 14:03.574
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:03.641 --> 14:05.275
THIS FAMILY'S
FINANCIAL SITUATION.

14:05.343 --> 14:06.677
YOU CANCELED
MY DOG WALKER,

14:06.745 --> 14:09.246
YOU'RE NO LONGER OFFERING
COFFEE IN THE KITCHEN.

14:09.313 --> 14:10.915
WE'RE CLEARLY
GOING UNDER.

14:10.982 --> 14:13.417
WE'RE NOT GOING UNDER.

14:13.484 --> 14:14.768
OH, COME ON.
THIS IS THE WALK

14:14.836 --> 14:17.855
WHEN YOU JUST LEAVE ME
IN THE WOODS, ISN'T IT?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.056
NO! EVERYTHING'S FINE!

14:19.124 --> 14:21.808
I TOLD YOU THAT THE ONLY
REASON I'M WALKING YOU

14:21.876 --> 14:23.143
AND COOKING
AND DOING ERRANDS

14:23.211 --> 14:24.644
IS BECAUSE
DOUG IS MAKING ME.

14:24.712 --> 14:25.963
OH.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.165
WELL, YOU ARE HOME.

14:28.232 --> 14:32.402
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DOING
THINGS FOR YOUR HUSBAND?

14:32.470 --> 14:35.323
NOTHING. JUST A LOT
OF THINGS I WANT TO DO,

14:35.390 --> 14:36.790
YOU KNOW, LIKE, FOR ME.

14:36.858 --> 14:40.261
LIKE I WANTED TO DO
ALL THIS READING

14:40.329 --> 14:44.231
AND HAD THIS IDEA TO MAKE
DESIGNER CELL PHONE CASES.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.733
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO STOP BLAMING DOUGLAS

14:46.802 --> 14:50.971
AND START
FOLLOWING YOUR DREAM.

14:51.039 --> 14:53.974
I THINK CELL PHONE RAZORS
ARE A BRILLIANT IDEA.

14:54.042 --> 14:55.810
YOU TALK. YOU SHAVE.

14:55.877 --> 14:58.045
IT'S MARVELOUS.

14:58.113 --> 15:01.699
CELL PHONE CASES,
DAD. CASES.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.083
OH.

15:03.151 --> 15:08.321
WELL...
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

15:12.827 --> 15:16.080
HEY, YOU GUYS,
I WENT TO THE CRAFT STORE,

15:16.148 --> 15:17.581
AND I GOT SOME MORE FABRIC.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.716
AND I ALSO GOT
THE LITTLE PLASTIC HOT DOGS

15:19.784 --> 15:22.086
FOR THE "TAKE ME OUT
TO THE BALL GAME" PHONES.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.587
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

15:23.655 --> 15:26.323
I'M ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH
GLUING THE RHINESTONES ON THESE.

15:26.391 --> 15:29.960
SHOULD BE VERY POPULAR
WITH THE FEY CROWD.

15:30.028 --> 15:33.580
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH
FOR HELPING ME OUT HERE.

15:33.648 --> 15:35.432
CAN I TAKE A BREAK?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.502
MMM, ACTUALLY,
MICKEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:38.570 --> 15:40.972
UM, PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
COMING HERE IN A FEW HOURS,

15:41.039 --> 15:42.506
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST FINISH
WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE,

15:42.574 --> 15:44.174
AND THEN WE'LL SEE
WHERE WE'RE AT, OK?

15:44.242 --> 15:45.442
SO, ALL RIGHT,
NOW, ALL THESE

15:45.510 --> 15:47.111
ARE FOR THE COWGIRL-THEMED
PHONES, ALL RIGHT?

15:47.178 --> 15:48.946
SO YOU GUYS
GLUE ON THE LASSOS,

15:49.014 --> 15:51.749
AND I'LL-I'LL
SEW ON THE DENIM.

15:51.816 --> 15:56.570
I'M SO THIRSTY.

15:56.638 --> 15:58.305
HEY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:58.373 --> 16:02.193
HEY, HONEY. I AM
OFFICIALLY OUT OF MY FUNK.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.945
I AM FINALLY MAKING
MY CELL PHONE CASES.

16:05.013 --> 16:06.297
REALLY?
THAT'S GREAT!

16:06.365 --> 16:07.631
YEAH. HEY,
CHECK THIS ONE OUT.

16:12.670 --> 16:15.739
WOW. FUZZY.

16:15.807 --> 16:19.343
YES, AND I INVITED A FEW PEOPLE
OVER TONIGHT FOR A LITTLE PARTY

16:19.411 --> 16:21.679
SO I CAN WHIP THESE OUT
AND SELL 'EM.

16:21.746 --> 16:22.712
WHO'D YOU INVITE?

16:22.780 --> 16:24.815
OH, JUST SOME OF OUR
FRIENDS, THE NEIGHBORS,

16:24.883 --> 16:26.217
SOME PEOPLE
YOU WORK WITH.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.185
WELL,
AIN'T THAT NICE?

16:28.252 --> 16:30.120
YEAH. YEAH.

16:30.188 --> 16:31.455
WELL, IT WORKED
FOR TUPPERWARE, RIGHT?

16:34.426 --> 16:36.660
<i>TUPPERWARE
WAS A GOOD IDEA.</i>

16:40.281 --> 16:41.581
OK.

16:41.649 --> 16:43.099
UH, HELLO.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.053
I JUST WANT TO THANK
EVERYONE FOR COMING.

16:46.121 --> 16:48.922
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL WONDERING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

16:48.990 --> 16:52.025
UM, AS YOU MAY KNOW, I'VE
BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR A WHILE.

16:52.093 --> 16:54.261
IT'S OK.
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

16:54.329 --> 16:56.280
ANYWAY, UM,
WHILE I'VE BEEN HOME,

16:56.348 --> 16:57.614
I STARTED
MY OWN BUSINESS

16:57.682 --> 16:59.983
MAKING DESIGNER
CELL PHONE CASES,

17:00.052 --> 17:02.253
AND BECAUSE YOU GUYS
ARE ALL MY FRIENDS,

17:02.320 --> 17:04.521
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
FIRST CRACK AT BUYING THEM,

17:04.589 --> 17:07.824
SO MAY I PRESENT
TO YOU...

17:07.892 --> 17:09.709
MOBILE HOMES!

17:17.585 --> 17:20.387
MOBILE HOMES!
I GET IT!

17:20.454 --> 17:23.223
THEY'RE DECORATIVE HOMES
FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONE.

17:23.290 --> 17:24.958
EXACTLY.

17:25.026 --> 17:26.960
WOW. YOU MADE THESE?

17:27.028 --> 17:28.494
THEY'RE GORGEOUS.

17:28.561 --> 17:29.997
BUT I BET
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE.

17:30.064 --> 17:32.199
NOT FOR WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING.

17:36.788 --> 17:40.590
ARE THE LITTLE HAIRS ON THE BACK
OF YOUR NECK STANDING UP, TOO?

17:40.658 --> 17:43.794
DARLING, I DROPPED
MY CELL PHONE AGAIN.

17:43.862 --> 17:47.164
I WISH I HAD
A PROTECTIVE CASE PHONE-

17:47.231 --> 17:48.933
UH, PHONE CELL-

17:49.000 --> 17:51.468
I MEAN, CASE CELL-
OH, DAMN IT!

17:57.208 --> 17:59.810
OK, SO WHO'S FIRST?

18:01.313 --> 18:04.514
UH, WELL, HOW MUCH
IS THIS JETS ONE?

18:04.582 --> 18:07.901
OH, THE JETS ONE IS 45.

18:07.968 --> 18:10.603
DOLLARS?

18:10.671 --> 18:12.206
YEAH, I KNOW
IT SEEMS KIND OF HIGH,

18:12.274 --> 18:14.441
BUT YOU WANT TO PROTECT
YOUR PHONE, DON'T YOU?

18:14.509 --> 18:16.560
MY PHONE WAS FREE.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.462
HOW ABOUT YOU,
SPENCE?

18:18.529 --> 18:22.099
OH, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A COMBO PDA
PHONE, AND IT'S NOT GONNA FIT.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.150
OH, NO. I MADE THESE
TO FIT ANY PHONE.

18:24.219 --> 18:25.185
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE, UH-

18:25.253 --> 18:26.420
YEAH, LET ME SEE.

18:31.225 --> 18:33.393
YOU GOTTA WORK IT.
THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT.

18:33.461 --> 18:34.511
SEE? PERFECT.

18:34.579 --> 18:38.949
WELL, UH, OH, I THINK
IT'S DIALING SOMEBODY.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.150
LIKE YOU CAN'T USE
A NEW FRIEND, RIGHT?

18:40.218 --> 18:41.285
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, HOLLY.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.420
YOU LIKE YOUR DENIM,
RIGHT?

18:43.488 --> 18:44.788
HOLLY,
YOU LIKE YOUR DENIM.

18:44.855 --> 18:49.093
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE DENIM
COWGIRL CELL PHONE CASE, HUH?

18:49.160 --> 18:52.513
WELL, IT'S JUST, UM,
YOU RECENTLY LAID ME OFF,

18:52.580 --> 18:53.514

18:53.581 --> 18:54.932
OK, YOU'RE REHIRED.
IT'S $50.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.116
OK.
OK.

18:56.184 --> 18:57.284
HERE YOU GO.
GREAT. THANK YOU.

18:57.352 --> 18:58.969
THERE YOU GO.
AAH! OW!

18:59.036 --> 19:00.571
THE LITTLE LASSO CUT ME.

19:00.638 --> 19:03.590
I'M OK.
I'M OK. I'M OK.

19:06.761 --> 19:09.362
WHAT IS-WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

19:09.430 --> 19:10.530
I MEAN, WHY-

19:10.599 --> 19:13.300
WHY ARE NONE OF YOU
LOOKING DIRECTLY AT ME?

19:15.252 --> 19:17.587
OH, MY GOD.

19:17.655 --> 19:19.790
WHAT AM I DOING?

19:19.857 --> 19:22.959
THESE ARE AWFUL.

19:23.027 --> 19:24.027
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

19:25.763 --> 19:27.531
THEY'RE
AWFUL... GREAT.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.368
I'M-I'M SO SORRY.

19:35.022 --> 19:36.973
A LITTLE EYE CONTACT
WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU?

19:40.027 --> 19:42.429
HEY.

19:42.496 --> 19:44.164
WHAT AM I DOING?

19:44.232 --> 19:47.134
I'M GLUING PLASTIC
HOT DOGS ON CELL PHONES

19:47.201 --> 19:48.768
AND MAKING
MY FRIENDS BUY THEM.

19:51.239 --> 19:52.539
THEY'RE NICE.

19:52.606 --> 19:54.207
OH, SHUT UP.

19:54.275 --> 19:56.709
WOULD YOU MAKE THOSE PEOPLE GO AWAY?

20:05.970 --> 20:07.938
YEAH,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

20:08.005 --> 20:10.507
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I HIT ROCK BOTTOM

20:10.575 --> 20:12.543
WHEN I WAS LAYING ON THE
COUCH ALL DAY DOING NOTHING,

20:12.610 --> 20:14.278
BUT THIS IS WORSE.

20:14.345 --> 20:17.080
LOOK AT ME. I HAVE NO
JOB. I HAVE NO LIFE.

20:17.148 --> 20:21.418
I'M NOT FINDING MYSELF.
I'M TOTALLY LOST.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.704
SO-SO YOU FEEL LOST.

20:23.771 --> 20:26.873
YOU DON'T THINK
I'VE FELT LOST BEFORE?

20:26.941 --> 20:28.809
YOU DON'T THINK
THE GREAT GATSBY WAS LOST

20:28.876 --> 20:30.744
BEFORE HE BECAME A MAGICIAN?

20:36.166 --> 20:37.768
HE'S A MAGICIAN?

20:37.835 --> 20:39.269
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
COULD HE BE?

20:39.336 --> 20:42.038
HE'S THE GREAT GATSBY!

20:45.443 --> 20:49.045
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA FIND
YOURSELF EVENTUALLY.

20:49.113 --> 20:52.148
YOU KNOW, FOR NOW, MAYBE YOU
JUST NEED TO LIE ON THE COUCH.

20:52.216 --> 20:54.534
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'LL GO
OUT AND FIND A NEW JOB.

20:54.602 --> 20:57.705
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU'LL DO
THE CELL PHONE CASES AGAIN.

20:57.772 --> 21:00.373
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT PUSHING THAT.

21:02.376 --> 21:03.343
WHATEVER
YOU DECIDE TO DO,

21:03.411 --> 21:05.345
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M HERE FOR YOU

21:05.413 --> 21:08.015
AND I LOVE YOU.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.633
THANKS.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.536
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON
I KEEP YOU AROUND.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.287
I THINK I GOT IT.

21:14.355 --> 21:17.357
DARLING, I'VE DROPPED
MY CELLOPHANE CASE PHONE.

21:18.876 --> 21:20.326
DAMN IT!

21:20.395 --> 21:21.828
MICKEY,
LET'S RUN IT AGAIN.

21:28.853 --> 21:30.754
DARLING, I'VE DROPPED
MY CALL PHONE AGAIN.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.323
I WISH I HAD
A PROTECTIVE COATING

21:32.390 --> 21:34.458
ON MY COASTAL PHONE.

21:34.525 --> 21:36.359
OH, THIS IS TORTURE.
