00:00.734 --> 00:01.767
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:01.769 --> 00:03.302
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:06.038
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:08.607
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.676
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:13.112
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:14.681 --> 00:17.616
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:20.152
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:23.722
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:23.724 --> 00:26.558
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:29.461
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:29.463 --> 00:32.464
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:32.466 --> 00:35.567
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:39.271
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:39.273 --> 00:41.440
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:41.442 --> 00:43.275
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:43.277 --> 00:45.677
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:52.252 --> 00:54.219
â™ª

01:21.815 --> 01:22.815
Mr. Nelson,

01:22.817 --> 01:24.817
You're late.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.485
(sighs)
I'm sorry, avery.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.087
It's just that getting up early

01:28.089 --> 01:29.588
Is something
my body's not used to.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.324
Okay, I feel you.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.759
All right, I'll have a talk
with my body,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.194
And we'll be here on time.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.228
What you doing?

01:36.230 --> 01:38.363
Oh, rescuing a spider.

01:38.365 --> 01:41.200
Oh. Um...
(laughs)

01:41.202 --> 01:43.769
Yeah, do not come near me. Look.
Look, I'm-I'm serious. (groans)

01:43.771 --> 01:45.170
Brody nelson,
don't tell me you're afraid

01:45.172 --> 01:47.206
Of a little spider?
A little spider?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.841
Avery, look at the size
of that thing. That's not...

01:48.843 --> 01:51.410
Why are you looking
on the ground?

01:51.412 --> 01:53.745
I dropped it.
You dropped it.

01:53.747 --> 01:54.746
Avery...

01:54.748 --> 01:56.215
Your bag...
Well...

01:56.217 --> 01:57.749
Aah!
(laughing)

01:57.751 --> 01:59.318
(shouting)

01:59.320 --> 02:01.253
Well, spiders don't like it
when you're late.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.222
Sifter:
<i>So your plane's on the tarmac</i>

02:03.224 --> 02:04.890
At national, and you're
scheduled to leave

02:04.892 --> 02:07.159
In an hour for
new york city.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.128
The kirkendahl
hotel believes

02:09.130 --> 02:11.763
That their computer
network has been hacked.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.198
That connects every
location worldwide.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.633
This is the kirkendahl file.
What do we got?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.401
Three days ago,

02:16.403 --> 02:19.271
The hotel's computer intrusion
detection system

02:19.273 --> 02:22.141
Went off, sent an alert
from their east side property.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.376
And they had their
I.T. Team take a look at it?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.378
It appeared to be a glitch,
happens all the time.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.380
They reset the system,
it happened again.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.549
There's evidence
of a remote cyber intrusion.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.218
Kirkendahl's
wi-fi has been compromised.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.320
That means the hackers
could have access to

02:35.322 --> 02:36.388
The corporate computers

02:36.390 --> 02:38.390
And the guests'
personal devices.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.325
And they probably discovered
a vulnerable protocol,

02:40.327 --> 02:42.294
Used a root kit to gain access.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.795
Nah, that's doing
it the hard way.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.365
There's a known exploit in the
authentication credential.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.267
You should know
that, right?
Of course I know that.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.570
Guys? Guys?
You spilled water
on your keyboard.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.838
Then I saw a spider.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.872
It's not like I
did it on purpose.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.674
Whatever.
Let's just reign in

02:55.676 --> 02:57.176
Our intellect here.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.545
That hotel is
right next to the u.N.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.246
A lot of high-profile people
stay there.

03:01.248 --> 03:02.648
Diplomats, dignitaries,
celebrities.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.184
Yeah, and the u.N. Is back
in session in two days.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.752
We could be looking
at a dark hotel scenario here.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.887
Hackers targeting
the guests.
Yeah, or an attack

03:08.889 --> 03:10.322
Against the kirkendahl
corporation itself.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.591
Either way,
documents could be released.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.394
E-mails, texts,
sensitive information

03:15.396 --> 03:17.796
That could embarrass or expose
some very important people.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.331
Well, I've got
a meeting coming up

03:19.333 --> 03:20.532
With the fbi director.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.334
I'll tell him my team is on it,

03:22.336 --> 03:24.503
And that none
of that will happen.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.538
Enjoy your flight.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.655
Woman: <i>At the suggestion</i>
<i>of our in-house</i>

03:43.657 --> 03:46.391
Technical support team,
we shut down the wi-fi.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.228
Has any employee or guest
reported any strange e-mails,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.463
Of their individual
devices being hacked?

03:51.465 --> 03:54.466
What about pop-up alerts
instructing them

03:54.468 --> 03:56.868
To update a file
or a program?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.470
I don't know. Those pop-ups
appear all the time,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.405
Even on my home computer.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.407
Well, it's one of the ways
that devices are hacked.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.476
A free download
or product upgrade

04:04.478 --> 04:05.911
That looks like it's authentic.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.680
But instead of it being
the actual product,

04:08.682 --> 04:11.483
It's the delivery of malware--
<i>malicious software.</i>

04:11.485 --> 04:15.320
<i>The code gets released into</i>
<i>the computer like a virus,</i>

04:15.322 --> 04:16.755
<i>And the hacker takes over.</i>

04:16.757 --> 04:18.757
<i>It's like the hacker's</i>
<i>lurking inside the device.</i>

04:18.759 --> 04:20.859
<i>When a guest logs on to</i>
<i>your wi-fi, the hacker is able</i>

04:20.861 --> 04:23.695
<i>To see their room number,</i>
<i>the last name on their account,</i>

04:23.697 --> 04:24.963
<i>Even get their passwords.</i>

04:24.965 --> 04:26.632
But-but we-we shut down
the wi-fi,

04:26.634 --> 04:28.500
So that should
protect us, right?

04:28.502 --> 04:29.301
Mundo:
Depends.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.404
Some malware is programmed
to lay in wait

04:32.406 --> 04:34.373
For six hours, six days,
six months or more.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.309
Should-should we be copying
and deleting documents?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.011
No. Despite the definition
of the word "delete,"

04:39.013 --> 04:41.446
In the cyber world, almost
anything can be recovered.

04:41.448 --> 04:46.451
Agent ryan, as in-house counsel
for the kirkendahl corporation,

04:46.453 --> 04:49.388
I can't stress enough
the importance of privacy here.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.856
It is something
that we guarantee

04:50.858 --> 04:53.492
To our board members,
our employees and our guests.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.460
There must be something
that we can do.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.297
Many of our guests use aliases
when checking in,

04:58.299 --> 05:01.066
But their real names and
home addresses are in our files.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.503
Some engage in activity
that we keep very confidential,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.838
And I'm talking about more than
just ordering an adult movie.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.607
We-we send e-mails and texts

05:08.609 --> 05:11.343
Containing confidential
company information--

05:11.345 --> 05:12.511
Bonuses, salaries,

05:12.513 --> 05:13.779
Mergers.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.781
Activity that will have
serious repercussions

05:15.783 --> 05:17.816
If those communications
became public.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.519
(phone ringing)
pardon me.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.721
Yes.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.723
Say that again.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.658
(sighs)

05:26.660 --> 05:27.826
All right.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.594
Our hotel

05:29.596 --> 05:30.929
Security footage has been wiped.

05:30.931 --> 05:35.701
<i>Lobby... Entrances...</i>
<i>Guest room corridors.</i>

05:35.703 --> 05:38.403
<i>Everything recorded</i>
<i>in the past week.</i>

05:38.405 --> 05:39.838
Was the system connected
to the wi-fi?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.873
Yes.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.744
Ryan: If your surveillance
footage was wiped,

05:45.746 --> 05:47.846
I don't think
our hacker is interested

05:47.848 --> 05:49.448
In these confidential files

05:49.450 --> 05:50.682
That you're worried
about, counselor.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.884
Something else
is going on here.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.420
Something happened here
at your hotel,

05:55.422 --> 05:57.889
And someone is trying
to cover it up.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.925
(rock music playing loudly)
man: Ms. Foster?

06:01.961 --> 06:04.563
This is the hotel manager.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.733
Ms. Foster, your music
is disturbing other guests!

06:20.546 --> 06:21.646
(music stops)

06:32.592 --> 06:34.760
Ms. Foster?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.862
Oh, geez.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.633
Security. Call 911.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.708
(camera clicking)

06:52.512 --> 06:54.679
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

06:59.018 --> 07:01.853
(whimpering)

07:03.723 --> 07:05.857
(camera clicking)

07:32.618 --> 07:34.653
Mundo:
<i>The victim is adel foster,</i>

07:34.655 --> 07:38.190
She checked into this
room five days ago alone.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.659
Driver's license
lists her address as

07:40.661 --> 07:44.496
Nypd are reaching out to new
jersey police and her family.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.664
Room's disorganized.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.799
Bruises on her wrists.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.868
Indicates... A struggle.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.937
Most likely, a crime of passion.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.472
Detectives canvassed
the hotel guests.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.140
Nobody heard or saw anything.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.610
Most belonged to the victim,
the rest to housekeeping.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.878
However,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.780
I did find this
in the plumbing.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.715
The victim's cell phone.

08:07.753 --> 08:11.490
The target tried to destroy
it and then flush it.

08:17.797 --> 08:22.701
Ryan: <i>Well, the water likely</i>
<i>corroded the connectors.</i>

08:22.703 --> 08:26.605
<i>Data recovery is</i>
<i>gonna be tough.</i>

08:26.607 --> 08:28.106
The hotel invoice.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.075
Looks like around
3:00 this morning,

08:30.077 --> 08:32.010
She ordered a late-night
snack and a movie.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.645
Behavior of an insomniac.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.282
Food for one.
That indicates she was alone.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.918
Mundo:
Wait a minute. This is strange.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.587
What?
The medical examiner
just established

08:42.589 --> 08:44.122
Approximate time of death.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.624
Three nights ago.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.092
What?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.793
It's a hotel. How does
housekeeping not find the body?

08:48.795 --> 08:50.595
Stranger than that,

08:50.597 --> 08:52.764
According to the room invoice,

08:52.766 --> 08:56.201
Yesterday and the day before,
she ordered laundry,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.769
Room and spa services,

08:57.771 --> 08:58.904
And a movie.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.273
And this morning, breakfast.

09:01.275 --> 09:04.175
Well, it looks like
adel foster was alive

09:04.177 --> 09:06.778
For three days after she died.

09:10.049 --> 09:16.254
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

09:18.124 --> 09:23.895
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

09:23.897 --> 09:28.066
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

09:28.068 --> 09:31.603
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

09:31.605 --> 09:35.941
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

09:35.943 --> 09:39.644
â™ª and miles...

09:39.646 --> 09:41.813
â™ª oh, yeah.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.726
What have you got?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.695
Data from the kirkendahl hotel's
computer system.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.862
This is a blueprint layout

09:57.864 --> 09:59.030
Of a standard room.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.365
We can see the
computer controls

10:00.367 --> 10:02.801
And monitors pretty much
everything that happens.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.769
All run by one central
software package

10:04.771 --> 10:06.004
Called the
"digital butler."

10:06.006 --> 10:07.906
And this explains
why nobody in that hotel

10:07.908 --> 10:09.808
Found adel foster's body
for three days?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.009
We believe so.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.612
We detected malware
on the hotel server.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.313
It was sent to every employee

10:15.315 --> 10:16.848
Hidden inside a
party invitation.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.883
So that's how it
breached the firewall.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.886
Ah. And troy fell.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.755
Yeah, it was the trojans
themselves

10:23.757 --> 10:25.123
That opened up
their own city gates

10:25.125 --> 10:26.958
And pulled
the wooden horse inside.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.827
Just like the hotel employees

10:28.829 --> 10:30.829
Who opened the party invitation
and let in the malware.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.864
While they blindly
celebrated victory,

10:32.866 --> 10:34.966
Their enemy lay in wait.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.401
And troy fell.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.406
Krumitz:
Our hacker had

10:41.408 --> 10:43.942
Access to the hotel's
main computer.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.343
They found their way
to adel's guest room records

10:45.345 --> 10:47.112
And made it look
like she was alive and well

10:47.114 --> 10:49.381
Even though adel foster
was definitely dead.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.082
Well, that would
explain the manicure,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.385
The facial, ordering the movie,

10:53.387 --> 10:55.654
Even room service,
but what about housekeeping?

10:55.656 --> 10:57.055
No one ever
entered the room.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.256
Because the
"do not disturb" sign

10:58.258 --> 11:00.759
Is also controlled
by the computer system.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.895
Ramirez: Exactly. Maids won't
enter when the light is on.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.364
Hotels connect
physical devices and sensors

11:06.366 --> 11:08.833
In the hotel rooms
to one central computer

11:08.835 --> 11:10.902
To improve efficiency
and cut down cost--

11:10.904 --> 11:13.038
Controlling thermostats
and water temperature,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.106
Providing you with the ease
of ordering services

11:15.108 --> 11:17.809
From the hotel channel
on your television.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.011
From one computer,
they can control everything.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.846
Right. It's why they
sometimes charge you

11:21.848 --> 11:23.982
For the items in the
minibar just because

11:23.984 --> 11:26.851
<i>You move them.</i>

11:26.853 --> 11:28.853
<i>Now, the pressure</i>
<i>sensor on the shelves</i>

11:28.855 --> 11:29.888
<i>Sends a message</i>
<i>to the computer telling</i>

11:29.890 --> 11:33.358
<i>Its product has been consumed.</i>

11:33.360 --> 11:36.161
But as we all know,
computers can be hacked.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.296
I actually met the hat
who wrote the code.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.232
Called it a hospitality hack.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.334
All right, now, once
a hacker intrudes

11:43.336 --> 11:45.303
The hotel computer
system, he has control

11:45.305 --> 11:47.739
Over room assignments,
check in, check out,

11:47.741 --> 11:49.908
Television,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.010
Thermostat...

11:52.012 --> 11:54.345
Oh, my favorite: The
remote control curtains.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.114
Check this out.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.451
Wait...

11:59.453 --> 12:02.053
Nelson, are you
really doing that?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.123
Did you actually
hack this hotel from ctoc?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.858
Yeah, that was me.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.461
The point is if all
the conveniences are connected

12:09.463 --> 12:11.730
Through software
to one central computer,

12:11.732 --> 12:13.832
Once the hacker's
inside the system,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.400
He can create orders
for room service,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.168
Housekeeping, laundry pickup...

12:17.170 --> 12:18.837
Ramirez:
And none of it really happened.

12:18.839 --> 12:22.874
Mundo: <i>And all activity is</i>
<i>recorded under the guest's name</i>

12:22.876 --> 12:24.109
<i>And room number.</i>

12:24.111 --> 12:25.844
Which explains why a dead woman

12:25.846 --> 12:27.412
<i>Can order room service</i>
<i>and a movie.</i>

12:27.414 --> 12:29.247
Ryan:
<i>So as far as the hotel knew,</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:31.082
<i>The minibar</i>
<i>was being restocked,</i>

12:31.084 --> 12:32.784
<i>The laundry</i>
<i>was being picked up,</i>

12:32.786 --> 12:35.320
<i>The maids were performing</i>
<i>turndown services.</i>

12:35.322 --> 12:38.256
<i>A hacker can control</i>
<i>any guest's room 24/7.</i>

12:39.492 --> 12:42.260
This is a very sophisticated
cover-up of a murder.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.029
We need to know more
about our victim, adel foster.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.332
Her devices are on their way
to you now, krumitz.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.367
We need to find
this hospitality hacker.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.402
You can't break into a system
this complex

12:51.404 --> 12:53.304
Without leaving some
digital dust behind.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.040
We're on it.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.776
All right, so we got
our victim's laptop,

12:57.778 --> 12:59.844
Tablet and destroyed cell.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.479
Our killer has
a three-day head start.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.281
Puts him right
where we want him.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.784
(chuckles) he thinks
he got away with murder.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.085
Which means he already
made a mistake

13:07.087 --> 13:08.987
That will lead
us right to him.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.289
We are gonna find adel
foster's murderer.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.462
Nelson:
You know, I really could have

13:17.464 --> 13:19.230
Used these things two years ago.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.366
But you know every time
apple introduces a new device,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.034
There's a new cord,
a new connector,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.936
And then all the old stuff
is not compatible with

13:24.938 --> 13:27.205
The new stuff, so then you...
You know, you got to go back,

13:27.207 --> 13:29.207
Buy all the new apple products,
connect them and...

13:29.209 --> 13:30.942
Dude, dude, really?

13:30.944 --> 13:32.043
We're trying to work here.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.578
Okay, well, then give me
something to do.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.948
Here. Lay out all the
pieces of this cell phone.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.183
Disassemble it,
remove the circuit board,

13:38.185 --> 13:40.118
Then scrub the resistor
jumper connections.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.086
There's a toothbrush
and alcohol solution

13:42.088 --> 13:44.122
Right over there.
Oh, okay.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.990
I see how you do.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.326
New guy gets
the poop phone.
What?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.395
I happen to know that this was
the phone that was recovered

13:50.397 --> 13:52.030
From the toilet
in the hotel room.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.932
He's right.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.300
That is the poop phone.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.168
Really? You're gonna
encourage this?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.170
And you're not even
that new anymore.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.271
Okay, you know what, nelson?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.874
Fine. I will gladly
take the poop phone

14:02.876 --> 14:05.043
If you just do me
one favor and stop talking.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.544
Guys.
Okay, what, you in a bad
mood or something, krummy?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.046
You want to
talk about it?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.881
Oh. You're having
girl problems.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.883
Oh, my...
I knew it.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.551
Raven, could you grab me
that pen over there

14:13.553 --> 14:15.186
And stab me with it?
That would be awesome.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.222
Guys, will you cut it out
and come here.
You got no game.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.157
I found something.
I have... I have game.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.160
I went back
to the employee party invitation

14:22.162 --> 14:23.928
Where the malware was embedded.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.997
I couldn't find the information
on the computer that sent it.

14:25.999 --> 14:30.902
So, I responded yes. I got back
an auto-reply confirmation,

14:30.904 --> 14:34.239
And guess what-- our hacker
forgot to anonymize that e-mail.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.275
Pretty sure it's the same one
that sent the invitation.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.043
And I got his I.P. Address
on the computer.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.545
Yeah! These guys never
think two steps ahead.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.447
I love this job.
This is gonna

14:42.449 --> 14:44.082
Lead us right
to our hacker.

14:55.494 --> 14:58.563
â™ª

15:03.335 --> 15:05.336
Evan wescott? Is
this your computer?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.906
Yes. Why?
Fbi.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.540
You're under arrest
for computer fraud

15:09.542 --> 15:11.910
In connection with the
murder of adel foster.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.177
What? What are you
talking about? Hey, whoa.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.246
Hold on a minute.
I don't even know who that is.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.549
You got the wrong guy.
(grunts) I didn't kill anybody.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.020
We can do this the hard way,
or you can come quietly.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.029
You hacked the kirkendahl
hotel's main computer, evan.

15:31.031 --> 15:34.165
We know this because the I.P.
Address of the device used

15:34.167 --> 15:36.034
Led us back to your laptop.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.036
That's impossible.
I don't even know how to do

15:38.038 --> 15:39.671
Something like that.
Mundo:
You created a backdoor

15:39.673 --> 15:41.239
In the computer systems
and took control

15:41.241 --> 15:42.140
Of the hotel's
hospitality functions--

15:42.142 --> 15:43.374
Maid service,

15:43.376 --> 15:44.575
Room service, minibar.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.044
You murdered adel and activated

15:46.046 --> 15:50.214
Like she was alive
three days after her death.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.717
What? That's insane.
I didn't kill anybody.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.585
Your cell phone
places you at the hotel

15:54.587 --> 15:56.587
At the exact time
of adel foster's murder.

15:56.589 --> 16:01.059
Your phone's location services
puts you in that hotel.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.527
Location services?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.595
Mundo: <i>The little program</i>
<i>that's always running</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:06.564
<i>In the background</i>
<i>of your phone.</i>

16:06.566 --> 16:08.333
<i>Logs everywhere you go.</i>

16:08.335 --> 16:10.234
Ryan:
<i>Nifty little feature.</i>

16:10.236 --> 16:14.205
See the elevation listed
here? 29.7 meters.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.641
That's roughly
seven floors.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.143
Her body was found
in room 715.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.979
Okay, I-I'm not a murderer.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.046
Mundo:
Really?

16:22.048 --> 16:23.281
'cause you sure
sound like one

16:23.283 --> 16:25.283
In the text that
you sent adel.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.552
We found that
on your phone.

16:29.054 --> 16:31.089
These are not my text messages.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.192
And I already told you,
I don't know anybody named adel.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.761
Are you sure you
never talked to her?

16:36.763 --> 16:39.263
This is surveillance footage
from your bar, evade,

16:39.265 --> 16:40.331
On the night she
was murdered.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.633
â™ª

16:53.445 --> 16:56.147
I mean, 'cause that
sure as hell looks like her,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.449
And that is definitely you.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.285
Look, man, a lot of people
come into my club.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.221
And, yeah, I meet
a lot of women.
Mundo: Yeah?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.289
Well, this one was murdered
three days ago.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.458
Where were you?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.494
I was at the club.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.195
I'm always at the club.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.199
It's a pretty crowded place
at night.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.136
Could easily step out for an
hour, and no one would miss you.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.238
This is ridiculous.
I didn't do anything.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.306
At first, I couldn't understand
why you went to all the trouble

17:22.308 --> 17:25.309
To make it look like
adel was still alive.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.578
Mundo: You wanted
to buy yourself time

17:27.580 --> 17:29.781
To create an alibi.
The hotel hack.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.315
And you certainly
can't deny

17:31.317 --> 17:33.184
That you were
capable of doing it.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.286
You were a computer
science major

17:35.288 --> 17:36.754
At kenniwick university.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.456
Day one, nobody found the body.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.292
Day two, no one came for you.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.795
Mundo: Day three,
you got comfortable.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.329
You distanced yourself
from the murder.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.265
Tying you to
the scene of the crime.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.368
You got away with murder.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.436
Almost.
Evan:
No.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.637
I didn't kill anybody.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.372
I didn't do any of these things.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.673
Evan...

17:55.675 --> 17:59.377
Your devices tell us
you're lying.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.086
â™ª

18:37.750 --> 18:42.753
Adel is... Er, was...
My girlfriend.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.622
I don't understand
how this happened.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.757
Doesn't the hotel
have security?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.659
We're still investigating
the circumstances

18:48.661 --> 18:49.660
Surrounding
adel's death.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.665
When her cell kept
going to voicemail,

18:54.667 --> 18:57.602
They said that she was
still checked in.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.837
I thought that
she had lost her phone.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.839
You know? I mean,
she does that a lot.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.908
But I never thought...

19:07.279 --> 19:09.447
...You know, that, um,
that she was dead.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.516
You spoke to her the night
that she was killed.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.550
Yeah, she seemed excited.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.218
Talking a mile a minute.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.520
(sniffles)

19:15.522 --> 19:16.487
Adel saved up money

19:16.489 --> 19:18.489
For months for this trip.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.292
You know, she had
a whole itinerary:

19:21.294 --> 19:24.462
Coney island, statue of liberty,
empire state building,

19:24.464 --> 19:25.897
A couple of broadway shows.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.698
Why didn't you
go with her?

19:29.635 --> 19:31.836
I got called into work
last minute.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.504
What do you do?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.740
Some part-time stuff.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.508
Operations and safety
at the hospital,

19:37.510 --> 19:42.313
They were short on staff
and needed some extra help.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.549
I was trying to save money
so we could go to europe.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.219
I think, uh...

19:48.221 --> 19:50.521
I think she wanted to experience
new york this time on her own.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.256
She loved the city.

19:54.226 --> 19:55.693
Even though we were
in east rutherford,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.728
We didn't get
up here often.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.599
I'm sorry. I, uh...

20:01.601 --> 20:03.301
I just can't believe

20:03.303 --> 20:05.236
She's gone.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.638
All right. Every piece is
scrubbed, dried and connected.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.507
Between that spider
this morning

20:09.509 --> 20:11.542
And this phone, boy, I
could so use a hot shower.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.977
Dude, man up.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.847
We are gonna rebuild adel's
phone and resurrect its memory.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.282
You mean we
can do that?

20:18.284 --> 20:19.884
We can actually get
data off of this thing?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.586
Watch and learn, son.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.454
This is how
the good guys do it.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.656
Watch and learn.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.692
â™ª

20:47.713 --> 20:49.847
â™ª

21:00.959 --> 21:02.893
You see what I'm seeing?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.028
Yeah.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.998
Mundo: <i>So krumitz was able</i>
<i>to pull some data</i>

21:07.000 --> 21:09.500
Off adel's phone, but the
threatening text messages

21:09.502 --> 21:10.701
From evan
aren't there.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.902
Were they deleted?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.437
They never existed.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.439
So I double-checked with
evan's service provider.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.508
They have no record of the
calls or the texts either.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.511
Which means evan didn't send
or receive those texts.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.580
So how did they get
on his phone?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.715
So elijah sent me everything
he pulled off

21:24.717 --> 21:26.417
Evan wescott's phone.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.885
Those text message conversations

21:27.887 --> 21:29.954
Between evan and adel
were faked.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.523
How can somebody fake a text
on another device?

21:32.525 --> 21:34.392
Once you get a text message
into your phone,

21:34.394 --> 21:36.294
It's added to
one long database.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.663
<i>If you're smart enough</i>
<i>and have the right software,</i>

21:38.665 --> 21:40.931
<i>You can manipulate that file</i>
<i>and make it look</i>

21:40.933 --> 21:43.801
<i>Like you're getting text</i>
<i>messages from whoever you want.</i>

21:43.803 --> 21:44.869
Whenever you want.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.339
Or to someone else's phone.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.642
Mmm. "happy new year, krumitz,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.679
From your best pal, sifter."

21:54.681 --> 21:57.648
Sent from your phone
January 1, 2016.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.649
That is impressive.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.652
And a little creepy.
Yeah.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.454
Now, would you need
physical access to evan's phone

22:03.456 --> 22:08.092
No. Plus, evan's phone doesn't
even have the software necessary

22:08.094 --> 22:11.095
To manipulate the database--
it had to be done remotely.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.631
And that's not all.
Gps coordinates

22:13.633 --> 22:14.932
That put evan wescott
in the hotel room

22:14.934 --> 22:16.434
At the time of the murder...

22:16.436 --> 22:17.635
Faked.
Faked.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.770
His phone was hacked.
Yeah!

22:19.772 --> 22:20.805
Oh...
(grunts)

22:20.807 --> 22:23.074
Avery,

22:23.076 --> 22:25.810
All of our digital evidence
is lying to us.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.745
Is krumitz sure
no mistake was made?

22:27.747 --> 22:30.014
What about the
malware injected

22:30.016 --> 22:32.483
Into the hotel's
computer system?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.051
It came from
evan wescott's computer.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.520
But krumitz doesn't believe
evan is our hacker.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.389
He's sure?
Sifter: Yes.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.524
And how many times have you
told me that daniel krumitz is

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
The best white hat
hacker ever?

22:42.528 --> 22:46.597
Looks like evan wescott
is being framed for murder.

22:52.905 --> 22:56.774
They had to route the
intrusion through his laptop,

22:56.776 --> 22:58.642
Change the gps,
and create those text messages.

22:58.644 --> 23:00.044
Maybe he framed himself.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.580
Clearly, you're new to this
and don't understand

23:02.582 --> 23:04.915
The behavior of a criminal.
Other than yourself.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.051
What I understand is I would do
anything not to go to prison.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.887
Pretty risky to frame yourself.
It's working for evan.
You believe he's innocent.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.522
I believe in cyber evidence.

23:11.524 --> 23:15.459
I'm just saying his devices
could be manipulated by anybody.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.161
Evidence doesn't point
to the identity of a hacker.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.163
So what happened
when we caught you?

23:19.165 --> 23:20.598
See, why you want
to get all personal?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.732
What?
That's what I'm saying...

23:21.734 --> 23:23.834
Guys? Guys?
(arguing continues)

23:23.836 --> 23:25.803
Stop! Stop! Focus on the case!
Whatever, whatever.

23:25.805 --> 23:26.871
Focus on the case.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.706
Whoever hacked them,

23:28.708 --> 23:30.741
Gained access to
at least one

23:30.743 --> 23:31.909
Of evan wescott's devices.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.744
Evan has full access
to all of his devices.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.045
Physical access
is the easiest,

23:35.047 --> 23:37.415
Which is why I think it's evan.
Physical access

23:37.417 --> 23:38.749
Is also the riskiest.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.917
Nelson, just for a minute,

23:39.919 --> 23:41.919
Try to buy into the fact
that adel's killer

23:41.921 --> 23:46.424
The hacker behind this
had to have skills.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.192
Evan has a computer
science degree.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.794
(scoffs, groans)
I'm just saying!

23:49.796 --> 23:51.862
All right, fine,
I'll, uh...

23:51.864 --> 23:53.764
I'll play along.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.766
The hacker could've easily
done this remotely.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.835
If I'd done it,
I'd "war drive" him.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.872
<i>Pull up to his house.</i>

24:01.874 --> 24:03.574
<i>Hack into his wi-fi,</i>

24:03.576 --> 24:05.543
<i>Plant everything</i>
<i>on his computer and phone</i>

24:05.545 --> 24:09.580
<i>While he's still inside,</i>
<i>totally oblivious.</i>

24:09.582 --> 24:10.915
It's still too risky.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.650
You're sitting
outside of his house.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.185
What if somebody sees you?
Or your car?

24:14.187 --> 24:17.521
The best way to do it is from
the safety of your own home.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.856
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is "spear phish" him--</i>

24:18.858 --> 24:20.691
<i>A socially engineered attack.</i>

24:20.693 --> 24:22.693
<i>Send evan an e-mail</i>
<i>with a fake link</i>

24:22.695 --> 24:25.830
<i>From his bank or something,</i>
<i>wait for him to click on it,</i>

24:25.832 --> 24:26.897
<i>And then boom!</i>

24:26.899 --> 24:28.732
<i>Full access to his laptop</i>

24:28.734 --> 24:31.969
<i>And any device that connects</i>
<i>to it, like his phone!</i>

24:31.971 --> 24:34.672
Okay, so how you know he's gonna
click on it? And when?

24:34.674 --> 24:36.607
Whoever did this
was short on time.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.676
The best way to stay anonymous
and get instant access

24:38.678 --> 24:40.144
To evan's devices is
to wait for him

24:40.146 --> 24:42.213
To connect to an open
wi-fi signal somewhere.

24:42.215 --> 24:45.216
<i>Anywhere they're advertising</i>
<i>free wi-fi is like a hacker's</i>

24:45.218 --> 24:48.052
<i>Virtual playground-- tons</i>
<i>of unexpected people unaware</i>

24:48.054 --> 24:50.221
<i>That the person next to them</i>
<i>sharing the same connection</i>

24:50.223 --> 24:51.822
<i>Could be intruding</i>
<i>onto their devices</i>

24:51.824 --> 24:53.924
<i>And stealing</i>
<i>all their information.</i>

24:53.926 --> 24:57.261
<i>Or in evan's case,</i>
<i>adding information.</i>

24:57.263 --> 24:58.762
Look, I still think
he could've done it himself.

24:58.764 --> 24:59.763
I mean, that's just me.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.699
Wi-fi is the best option.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.834
So... Where was evan hacked?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.736
Well, according to his frequent
locations on evan's phone,

25:05.738 --> 25:07.705
He went to the gym
three or four times a week.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.006
Most gyms have free wi-fi.
Restaurants, too.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.575
I bet you he was
eating out every night.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.677
You know, club owners
score mad dates.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.714
How often is
he at carla's cafe?

25:17.716 --> 25:19.683
Ramirez:
Almost every day.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.254
Well, according to the
network logs in evan's laptop,

25:23.256 --> 25:24.855
He connected
to the coffee shop's wi-fi

25:24.857 --> 25:26.190
The morning after the murder.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.825
You still think
it's a possibility

25:27.827 --> 25:29.093
That he framed himself?

25:29.095 --> 25:31.862
Yeah. I do.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.805
All right.
So I spoke to the manager.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.742
They're just there
as a crime deterrent.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.744
They don't record
a damn thing.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.313
But... The wi-fi went
down three days ago

25:49.315 --> 25:54.585
Now, according to evan's laptop,
he was long gone at that time.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.687
But not onto the cafe's router.

25:56.689 --> 26:00.024
Maybe someone set up
an evil twin router.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.026
And that's how he got hacked.
Now, my phone...

26:02.028 --> 26:04.061
Can give the illusion
of being a wi-fi signal,

26:04.063 --> 26:05.596
Same as a twin router.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.299
All I have to do is activate
my own personal hot spot

26:08.301 --> 26:11.268
From my device,
and I am open wi-fi.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.270
I can even name it
anything I want.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.073
Say we're
in carla's cafe, right?

26:16.075 --> 26:19.944
Think I'll name
my new hot spot network...

26:19.946 --> 26:21.712
"carla's cafe."

26:21.714 --> 26:23.247
Now, log on to the free wi-fi.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.184
(laughs)

26:27.186 --> 26:29.119
Which one? There are two.

26:29.121 --> 26:32.590
The one I just created
and the real one.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.792
I'm guessing
our target eliminated

26:34.794 --> 26:36.927
The real carla's cafe wi-fi.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.696
<i>Evan came in,</i>

26:38.698 --> 26:41.632
<i>Logged on to</i>
<i>the decoy signal...</i>

26:41.634 --> 26:44.201
<i>And the hacker</i>
<i>gained control of his device.</i>

26:44.203 --> 26:45.669
You just did all that
with your phone?

26:45.671 --> 26:47.871
Just a few clicks of a button.

26:47.873 --> 26:51.609
Now, I-I can't control
your device from my phone,

26:51.611 --> 26:53.844
<i>But our target had</i>
<i>an actual router.</i>

26:53.846 --> 26:55.913
<i>He was able to push</i>
<i>any information he wanted</i>

26:55.915 --> 26:59.016
<i>Onto evan's devices.</i>

26:59.018 --> 27:01.018
I mean, anytime
you log on to open wi-fi,

27:01.020 --> 27:04.955
Or in our case,
you become a murder suspect.

27:04.957 --> 27:09.860
Looks like it just happened
to evan wescott.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.264
Raven, I need you
to track down

27:14.266 --> 27:16.400
The owner of an
evil twin router.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.747
(chuckles)
right.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.148
Nelson thinks
evan framed himself.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.317
That would be a smart move.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.653
You don't really
believe that, do you?

27:35.655 --> 27:37.187
Nelson thinks the
way hackers do.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.856
But...

27:38.858 --> 27:40.924
Evan has no motive.

27:40.926 --> 27:43.427
And no definitive
connection to adel foster

27:43.429 --> 27:45.963
Other than a kiss;
and kisses rarely

27:45.965 --> 27:47.331
Get you convicted of murder.

27:51.102 --> 27:53.937
You miss new york.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.873
Yeah, feeling a
bit nostalgic.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.909
I opened my first
practice in manhattan.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.444
Hung the shingle
on a brownstone

28:00.446 --> 28:02.913
Just like that one there.
Went from

28:02.915 --> 28:05.249
Analyzing minds to
analyzing cyber criminals.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.218
Wasn't really a plan,
it just happened.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.020
You ever think
about moving back?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.321
No.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.791
I only think about one thing.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.427
Catching the guy that
hacked and stole my files.

28:16.429 --> 28:18.962
There isn't a morning where
I don't wake up wondering

28:18.964 --> 28:20.431
If today's the day
that he's gonna

28:20.433 --> 28:22.733
Release private
patient information.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.268
And the whole nightmare
will start all over again.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.136
We'll catch him.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.138
(sighs)

28:28.140 --> 28:30.974
You know what I miss
about this place?

28:30.976 --> 28:32.076
The mets.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.144
The mets?
(laughs)

28:35.346 --> 28:37.414
I would comment,
but you'd probably fire me.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.752
But there is one question
I can't shake, elijah.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.120
Evan wescott.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.354
What about him?

28:44.356 --> 28:46.123
Well, the beauty
of an open wi-fi hack

28:46.125 --> 28:48.125
Is its sheer randomness.

28:48.127 --> 28:51.328
Our killer could've framed
anyone on his router

28:51.330 --> 28:53.230
For adel's murder.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.499
You think the target
chose evan specifically.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.768
Adel went to evan's club
the night of the murder.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.903
And the next morning,
evan ends up at carla's cafe

28:59.905 --> 29:02.840
At the exact same time
as the evil twin router.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.274
It feels personal.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.510
Our target crafted
a murder for evan.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.212
Fabricated texts

29:08.214 --> 29:11.949
And gps data, linked
him to the hotel hack.

29:11.951 --> 29:15.786
He set up evan as a fall guy
for a reason, but why?

29:18.223 --> 29:20.290
I identified the
router that was used

29:20.292 --> 29:22.126
To hack evan in carla's cafe.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.327
The latest and greatest

29:23.329 --> 29:25.162
In evil twin deception, huh?

29:25.164 --> 29:28.232
Manufacturer gave me the big
box store where it was sold.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.000
All right, from your smirk,
I'm guessing

29:30.002 --> 29:31.969
It was purchased recently.
Mm-hmm.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.238
Point of sale puts that
gentleman at the register.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.306
He paid cash.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.076
Get this to avery and elijah.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.277
We've got him.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.446
(tablet chimes)

29:42.448 --> 29:45.249
Look who was in manhattan
the morning after adel's murder.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.417
Just got this from raven.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.420
Oh. The heartbroken boyfriend.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.195
Mundo:
<i>Shane tillman, fbi!</i>

30:06.337 --> 30:08.338
He's not here.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.277
I'm gonna image the hard drive,

30:13.279 --> 30:16.146
Send it to nelson and krumitz
to comb through the data.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.248
Ryan:
Broken cup.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.386
Damaged wall.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.887
There was an argument.

30:28.593 --> 30:30.227
Adel wasn't visiting new york.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.963
She was running away from shane.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.065
You know, something struck
me as odd when I saw

30:35.067 --> 30:37.467
The bruises on her wrist
at the crime scene.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.270
Look. They're purple,
almost black.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.339
If she'd gotten these during
the struggle the night

30:42.341 --> 30:44.975
That she was killed, they'd
be pink or not even visible.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.544
She got these before
the night she was killed.

30:50.949 --> 30:54.284
Adel was leaving shane.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.619
He came home.

30:59.924 --> 31:00.991
Stop it!

31:00.993 --> 31:02.259
He pulled her things
out of her bag

31:02.261 --> 31:04.061
To prevent her from leaving.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.529
When she escaped,
he grabbed her wrists,

31:05.531 --> 31:06.997
Which caused the bruising.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.298
(both grunting)

31:08.300 --> 31:10.367
Oh, god!
(groaning)

31:15.139 --> 31:18.575
When she left,
he started drinking.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.043
He followed her

31:20.045 --> 31:21.545
To new york and
he killed her.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.148
My god.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.252
Even when women get the courage
to leave abusive relationships,

31:28.254 --> 31:30.387
Sometimes they still get killed.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.256
So what's his next move?

31:32.258 --> 31:34.358
Well, he's angry.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.059
He's calculated.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.427
He's got
nothing to lose.

31:45.003 --> 31:47.271
And he's armed and dangerous.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.906
Ramirez:
I just hit a dead end.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.607
Tillman's phone's
not showing a signal.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.377
He must have turned it off.
There's no way to track him.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.279
I'll see what we can do
with tillman's laptop.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.381
His recent online activity
should give us a glimpse

31:57.383 --> 32:02.019
Yeah, well, clearing
your history may hide porn sites

32:02.021 --> 32:04.288
From your girlfriend, but
it won't hide anything from me.

32:04.290 --> 32:08.191
Browser artifacts are easily
recovered with the right tools.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.394
Oh, check it out. Mostly
new york news affiliates.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.930
He's following the adel foster
murder investigation.
You think he knows

32:12.932 --> 32:14.364
We're onto him?
Always assume

32:14.366 --> 32:16.066
That the bad guys are two steps
ahead of you, nelson.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.301
That way, you're
prepared for anything,

32:17.303 --> 32:19.202
And you're never
caught off guard.

32:19.204 --> 32:22.539
Hey, man, he visited a
cell phone locating site?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.374
I mean, what, he
lost his cell phone?

32:24.376 --> 32:26.143
No, he wasn't looking
for <i>his</i> phone.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.011
He was tracking
someone else. Look.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.313
That area code is 212.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.315
That's new york, not jersey.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.350
Krumitz:
I'll call elijah.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.652
<i>Elijah, shane tillman is using</i>

32:35.654 --> 32:37.654
<i>A cell phone location</i>
<i>tracking site.</i>

32:37.656 --> 32:39.423
<i>He's going after evan wescott!</i>

32:39.425 --> 32:41.425
â™ª

33:20.064 --> 33:21.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.266
Problem is with me.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.768
Just let these
people go.
Shut up!

33:24.770 --> 33:27.304
This wouldn't be happening
if it wasn't for you.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.506
You took her away from me.
Buddy, I think you
got the wrong guy.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.575
It was you! It was you!

33:31.577 --> 33:34.411
I saw you with adel
right here in this bar.

33:43.187 --> 33:46.256
Look, man, just drop the gun,
and we can talk

33:46.258 --> 33:48.392
About whatever it is that
you think may have happened.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.727
No, I <i>know</i> what happened!
I know what happened!

33:50.729 --> 33:52.596
(siren wailing)

33:59.470 --> 34:01.405
You took her away from me.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.773
Of course, you don't remember.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.474
There's so many women,
aren't there?

34:04.476 --> 34:05.809
You just have to have them all?

34:05.811 --> 34:08.745
I needed a chance to explain,
to say I was sorry.

34:08.747 --> 34:12.082
To say I was sorry.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.717
But you...
You were all over her.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.186
And I could see in her eyes,
she wasn't coming back to me.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.721
Shane?

34:18.790 --> 34:20.824
Stay where you are!

34:22.060 --> 34:23.794
Stay where you are!

34:23.796 --> 34:26.696
Or this isn't gonna end
the way you want it to.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.799
Let her go and
put down the gun.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.767
He killed my girlfriend,
and you did nothing.

34:30.769 --> 34:33.770
At the count of three,
I'm gonna discharge this weapon.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.138
You need to decide

34:35.140 --> 34:37.140
What you're gonna
do. One, two...

34:37.142 --> 34:38.542
Okay.

34:38.544 --> 34:40.243
Okay.

34:42.447 --> 34:43.447
Good.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.648
Now kick it
towards me.

35:04.235 --> 35:05.602
Stay right where you are.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.175
W-wait, don't do
that, don't do that.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.211
I can't live without her!

35:14.213 --> 35:15.345
Shane. Shane!

35:18.516 --> 35:19.649
I got you!

35:19.651 --> 35:20.784
Hang on!

35:20.786 --> 35:22.185
I got you!

35:43.875 --> 35:46.143
â™ª

36:08.599 --> 36:09.933
Ryan:
Are you okay?

36:09.935 --> 36:12.669
Yeah. Yeah.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.837
We got him.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.505
We're not done.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.641
We still haven't put
shane tillman

36:17.643 --> 36:19.809
In that hotel room
at the time of the murder.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.212
We still have to prove
who killed adel foster.

36:24.482 --> 36:25.949
Anything on shane's phone?

36:25.951 --> 36:28.451
I need to know what we've got
before I question him.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.519
Sifter:
Well, nothing concrete.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.354
I'm heading in now
for an update.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.223
Krumitz: Yeah!
Nelson: That's what
I'm talking about!

36:33.225 --> 36:34.357
We got it.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.193
We found proof.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.929
(stammers)

36:38.931 --> 36:40.864
I'm gonna call you back.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.933
Wh-what kind of proof
did you find?

36:42.935 --> 36:46.369
Proof that shane tillman was
at the scene of the crime.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.471
Proof that he murdered
adel foster?

36:48.473 --> 36:49.839
If we're lucky, both.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.541
It's called a motion
tracking chip.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.842
Most new smartphones
have them,

36:52.844 --> 36:57.314
It's a motion co-processor that
collects and stores motion data

36:57.316 --> 37:00.317
On the phone's accelerometers,
gyroscopes and compasses.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.551
All right, so
basically it just...

37:01.553 --> 37:02.819
It records movement.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.821
Yeah, it's how an exercise app
knows the difference

37:04.823 --> 37:06.356
Between when you're jogging
versus walking,

37:06.358 --> 37:08.558
Which direction
you're headed--

37:08.560 --> 37:10.460
Pretty much however
your phone's moving.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.695
Krumitz:
As the phone moves,

37:11.697 --> 37:14.264
The motion tracking chip
records all of it.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.999
It will detect a pitch,
a roll, a tilt--

37:16.001 --> 37:18.001
Every movement the phone makes.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.537
Right, and it's
always on.
And it's separate
from the main processor.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.539
Let me get this right--
so if data were altered

37:22.541 --> 37:24.874
On that device, it would
never cross your minds

37:24.876 --> 37:26.543
To manipulate that file.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.545
Exactly.
So we pulled all the data

37:28.547 --> 37:32.649
Off shane's motion tracking
chip, and this is what we found.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.551
So the one on the left is
the motion tracking chip

37:34.553 --> 37:36.953
From shane's phone; the one
on the right is adele's.

37:36.955 --> 37:40.957
To the last time adel's phone
moved before she was murdered.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.299
Nelson: <i>Most people keep their</i>
<i>phones in their pants pockets.</i>

37:49.301 --> 37:51.401
Krumitz: <i>Which means the phone</i>
<i>was recording their movement.</i>

37:51.403 --> 37:54.838
So if two people were fighting,
and we had both phones...

37:54.840 --> 37:56.273
Sifter: <i>Right, we could</i>
<i>reenact the fight.</i>

37:56.275 --> 37:57.474
Nelson:
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:15.326 --> 38:16.660
Who is he?!

38:16.662 --> 38:18.828
Who is he?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.664
Tell me who he is!
Leave me alone!

38:20.666 --> 38:22.732
I'm not your
girlfriend anymore!

38:40.418 --> 38:42.352
Adel?

38:51.896 --> 38:54.531
Well, this not only puts
shane tillman in the room

38:54.533 --> 38:58.101
At the time of the murder,
it proves that he killed her.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.477
Avery: <i>You covered your tracks</i>
<i>from every possible angle.</i>

39:07.479 --> 39:09.479
You wiped your phone
of any wrongdoing,

39:09.481 --> 39:11.481
Pushed all the evidence
to evan's devices,

39:11.483 --> 39:14.784
You even hacked the hotel,
wiped its security footage.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.786
Ryan:
It was all very clever.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.022
But you forgot
one thing.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.024
One thing most people
don't know about--

39:21.026 --> 39:23.860
Your phone's
motion tracking chip.

39:25.963 --> 39:29.699
Cyber-synchronized
offender and victim.

39:31.635 --> 39:34.404
Records every
movement.

39:34.406 --> 39:37.374
Proves you killed
your girlfriend.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.908
(sniffles)

39:53.858 --> 39:55.925
What's this?

39:58.996 --> 40:00.397
Nelson: No!
(ryan stammers)

40:01.432 --> 40:03.032
No, no! You freed it?!

40:03.034 --> 40:04.701
Oh, what?

40:04.703 --> 40:07.404
Uh, there was a cup in
the middle of the floor.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.872
Hey, welcome back.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.407
Good job.
(grumbles)

40:10.409 --> 40:13.109
He has been preoccupied
with a little spider.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.778
What is all that?
(chuckles)

40:14.780 --> 40:16.479
What?
Some compressed air.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.047
I was gonna turn it over,
zap it, freeze it,

40:18.049 --> 40:19.482
Then I was gonna
set it free.

40:19.484 --> 40:20.884
Aw.
Cryonic preservation?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.852
I'm not hunting
that thing down again.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.789
Okay, I will help you
look for your spider.

40:25.791 --> 40:26.823
Thank you.

40:26.825 --> 40:27.924
We'll find it,

40:27.926 --> 40:29.459
And elijah will arrest it.
Yeah.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.427
Krumitz:
Well, now I have to help.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.462
Yeah. (shouts)

40:32.464 --> 40:34.097
Why... Why would
y'all do that?
(laughter)

40:34.099 --> 40:35.565
Why would
y'all do that?!
