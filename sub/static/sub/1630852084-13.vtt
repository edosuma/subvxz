Ooh, hold on now.

05:48.239 --> 05:51.176

my arm like that.

05:51.209 --> 05:53.645
I don't know you like that.

05:53.678 --> 05:56.681
Your grip is strong.

05:56.714 --> 05:57.849
Stronger than my mama.

05:57.882 --> 05:59.884
Girl, you got some dude

06:02.921 --> 06:05.223
- Don't be nasty, girl.
- Oh.

06:05.256 --> 06:07.192
Well, you might wanna let me
talk to him first.

06:07.225 --> 06:08.893
You know, this is really
gonna be hard for him,

06:08.927 --> 06:10.428
and he's gonna be really mad.

06:10.462 --> 06:12.030
- Why?

06:12.030 --> 06:14.599
- Because he was really
like...

06:14.632 --> 06:17.368
attached to his patch.

06:17.402 --> 06:18.803
- His patch?

06:18.837 --> 06:20.438
He trying to stop smoking?

06:20.472 --> 06:23.708
- No, his patch.

06:23.741 --> 06:26.044
His patch of weed.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.452
Not no more.

06:34.486 --> 06:35.820
- Okay.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.522
Say what?

06:37.555 --> 06:39.324

06:46.798 --> 06:48.399
- What you talking about?

06:48.433 --> 06:50.001
- And then she goes,
"Speak Spanish."

06:50.001 --> 06:52.370
Girl, I don't know how to
speak no Spanish.

06:52.403 --> 06:53.538

07:07.452 --> 07:09.420
- Okay, well, you are
safe now.

07:09.454 --> 07:11.823

07:11.856 --> 07:14.759
And she had me going
across that border.

07:14.793 --> 07:17.796
