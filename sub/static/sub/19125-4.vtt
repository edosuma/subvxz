Okay, guys, well,
let's get to it.

25:08.559 --> 25:10.860
For your Spotlight Challenge
this week,

25:10.895 --> 25:13.262
we asked you to create
a beautiful

25:13.297 --> 25:15.264

the Statue of Liberty.

Will you turn around for us?

28:31.762 --> 28:33.295
Oh.

28:33.331 --> 28:35.631
It's a huge waste of time
to sculpt hair on something

28:35.666 --> 28:37.166
that's supposed
to look like ice.

28:37.201 --> 28:38.967
It doesn't make any sense,
because they didn't even

Not so much the execution.

28:46.644 --> 28:48.143

functionally helping

28:50.681 --> 28:52.481
to support these shells.

28:52.516 --> 28:53.949
I really like the look of that.

28:53.984 --> 28:55.751
I really wish
they would have taken more time

beauty makeup on her eyes.

29:01.692 --> 29:02.958
Interesting.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.727
I like the use of silicone.

29:04.762 --> 29:07.129
I like the syncopated lines
and the way they break up,

29:07.164 --> 29:09.798
but a really wide jaw
leaves it looking masculine.

29:09.834 --> 29:11.367
This is all really well done.

29:11.402 --> 29:13.469
I just don't think this makeup
should have been used

29:16.807 --> 29:19.608
This reads like a beard

29:19.643 --> 29:21.610
I think it's
a really big misstep.

29:31.522 --> 29:32.888
this challenge, and since we've

29:32.923 --> 29:34.823
been on the bottom before,
we're really worried.

29:40.350 --> 29:41.717
It needed to go more towards

29:41.753 --> 29:43.285
the light blue-greens
or something.

29:43.321 --> 29:45.421
It's gotten so dark.

29:50.661 --> 29:52.995
really wanted to
go outside our comfort zone.

29:53.031 --> 29:56.065
I read this like black ice.
Like road ice.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.134
Maybe that's what
they were thinking too.

- Oh, she's stunning.

30:04.175 --> 30:05.474
Please turn.

30:05.510 --> 30:08.277
They seized upon the concept
of a frozen tree

30:08.312 --> 30:10.613
and used that to drive
what they were doing

30:10.648 --> 30:12.948
instead of just ice,
and that's brilliant.

30:12.984 --> 30:14.817
♪ ♪

30:14.852 --> 30:18.487
They did a great job of using
subtle differences in tone

30:18.523 --> 30:19.922
to break her face up.

30:19.957 --> 30:22.024
You're absolutely right;
It's really pretty.

30:22.060 --> 30:25.361
You know, although the
costume work is a little heavy,

30:25.396 --> 30:28.064
it feels very fitting in terms
of the character design.

30:28.099 --> 30:30.132

30:30.168 --> 30:33.803
Conceptually nice

30:35.006 --> 30:37.506
this whole crown piece up
2 inches,

30:37.542 --> 30:39.308
it would have been
really beautiful.

30:39.343 --> 30:42.244
Instead of using her natural,
beautiful shapes,

30:42.280 --> 30:43.679
it's working against it.

Tell us about your concept.

31:33.264 --> 31:34.563
This is Kiva, an Amazon

31:34.599 --> 31:36.198
that was outcast
to the mountains.

31:36.234 --> 31:38.367
And there, she became
leader of those people.

31:38.402 --> 31:39.568
She's a warrior queen.

31:39.604 --> 31:43.272
It is the single best
use of stencils

31:43.307 --> 31:46.342
that I've seen on the show.

31:46.377 --> 31:47.843
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

31:47.879 --> 31:50.880
The elongation of the forehead
really helped

31:50.915 --> 31:52.848
enhance her beauty
and facilitate

31:52.884 --> 31:55.050
a transition point into the ice.

31:55.086 --> 31:56.185
Absolutely gorgeous.

31:56.220 --> 31:57.586
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

31:57.622 --> 31:59.188
She had an incredible profile.

31:59.223 --> 32:02.191
When she walked out,
she was strong, beautiful.

32:02.226 --> 32:04.226
It's a subtle beauty makeup,
and I like the fact that

32:04.262 --> 32:06.595
you chose a dark lip for her,
because it brings out

32:06.631 --> 32:08.731
those gigantic eyes of hers.

32:08.766 --> 32:09.965
Thank you.

32:10.001 --> 32:13.135
She's so cold,
you can almost see her quiver.

32:13.171 --> 32:15.137
[laughter]

32:15.173 --> 32:16.805
Waited my whole life
to say that.

Truly, though,
the character is beautifully

your snow queen.

32:45.603 --> 32:49.505
She is a queen that led
her people through a battle,

32:49.540 --> 32:51.840
and after they won,
she decided to turn herself

32:51.876 --> 32:53.475
into an ice statue.

32:53.511 --> 32:56.579
The Statue of Liberty feel
of the snowflake

32:56.614 --> 32:59.548
helped inspire the
statuesque part of our makeup.

32:59.584 --> 33:01.417
I just don't think

the Statue of Liberty.

a great idea.

33:12.530 --> 33:13.729
Mm-hmm.

33:13.764 --> 33:15.197
She feels a little uninspired.

33:15.233 --> 33:19.034
If you're going to go
with a simile or a metaphor

33:19.070 --> 33:22.404
of something that is so classic
and so familiar,

33:22.440 --> 33:25.908
you need to execute it
in a way that's more obvious,

33:25.943 --> 33:28.177
as opposed to derivative.

33:28.212 --> 33:29.511
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

33:29.547 --> 33:32.681
She lacks the geometric beauty
of a snowflake.

33:32.717 --> 33:34.883
And that's the core
of this challenge.

33:34.919 --> 33:36.885
And because you chose to sculpt
the hair

33:36.921 --> 33:38.387
rather than the crown,

33:38.422 --> 33:40.923
you ended up with an anime look
to the sculpture.

Well, this is Evergreen,
the icy snow queen,

34:08.351 --> 34:10.652
and her reign upon the forest
is nearing an end

34:10.688 --> 34:12.187
