WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.676
My special day had veered off course

00:01.678 --> 00:03.479
so many times I'd lost track.

00:03.481 --> 00:06.500
Val hijacking graduation
for her wedding? Okay.

00:06.525 --> 00:08.350
My mother getting ordained online

00:08.352 --> 00:10.152
so she could marry my guidance counselor

00:10.154 --> 00:13.155
to some stuffed bear she
met on a ski trip, why not?

00:13.157 --> 00:14.556
The love of my life, who I thought

00:14.558 --> 00:15.624
I had all summer with

00:15.626 --> 00:17.226
telling me he's leaving?

00:17.228 --> 00:19.128
I really needed some space.

00:19.130 --> 00:21.329
Jenna Hamilton, Jenna Hamilton,

00:21.331 --> 00:24.232
please report to my office. Just kidding.

00:24.234 --> 00:28.770
Please report to me right now
because you're my Maid of Honor.

00:28.772 --> 00:30.605
Everyone, let's give it up for J-Town.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.350 --> 00:44.652
Sweetie, I know, it's so emotional.

00:44.654 --> 00:45.986
I'm getting married.

00:45.988 --> 00:48.022
You look so beautiful.

00:48.024 --> 00:49.422
You know what? You look
a little too beautiful.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.624
You're gonna have to back it up, J-Town.

00:50.626 --> 00:51.692
You're upstaging the bride.

00:51.694 --> 00:53.193
That's good. Thank you.

00:54.696 --> 00:56.463
Here we go. Thank you.

00:56.465 --> 00:58.032
Dear friends,

00:58.057 --> 01:02.681
we are gathered here today
for... well, your graduation.

01:02.706 --> 01:04.150
I'm so sorry.

01:04.821 --> 01:07.840
Also to join this man

01:07.842 --> 01:12.045
and this woman in holy cat-rimony.

01:12.047 --> 01:13.713
I didn't know how to break it to you.

01:13.715 --> 01:15.148
- Will you please go sit down?
- If anyone can show cause why

01:15.150 --> 01:16.783
these two people should not be joined,

01:16.785 --> 01:18.685
speak now or forever hold your peace.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.719
Can I just say one thing?

01:19.721 --> 01:21.720
No!

01:22.389 --> 01:24.022
Not you.

01:24.024 --> 01:25.624
I knew Matty felt bad.

01:25.626 --> 01:26.925
It's not like he planned this.

01:26.927 --> 01:28.927
It was just bad timing.

01:28.929 --> 01:30.462
Just when everything was coming together

01:30.464 --> 01:31.797
in everyone else's world,

01:31.799 --> 01:33.265
everything was unraveling in mine.

01:33.267 --> 01:36.302
By the power vested in
me by the online ministry

01:36.304 --> 01:37.803
SayYouDo.net,

01:37.805 --> 01:41.973
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:42.259 --> 01:43.641
Kiss!

01:51.218 --> 01:53.318
Still, it was a time of new beginnings.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.953
I had to find a way to be happy,

01:54.955 --> 01:56.922
to take back control of my special day.

01:56.924 --> 01:57.923
Get it, girls, get it!

01:59.426 --> 02:01.970
And then suddenly something hit me.

02:02.532 --> 02:04.562
Oh!

02:04.564 --> 02:06.364
Well, something besides that.

02:06.657 --> 02:10.211
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

02:10.619 --> 02:12.120
It's like some weird force

02:12.122 --> 02:14.589
was determined to keep me and Matty apart.

02:14.591 --> 02:16.554
Maybe we hadn't tried hard enough.

02:16.579 --> 02:18.813
Maybe we let too many
obstacles get in the way.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.993
Whatever it was, we had
wasted way too much time,

02:22.009 --> 02:23.709
which is what I was going to put a stop to.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.377
- Hey, Matty.
- Hey.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.246
As soon as I could figure
out where the hell he went.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.981
Your speech was so inspiring, Sadie.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.084
- I'm so proud of you.
- Whatever.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.819
You totally used your meanness for good.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.621
It would have been nice
if someone had been there

02:35.623 --> 02:36.822
to share it with me.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.190
Oh, like your mommy?

02:38.192 --> 02:40.992
Who gives a crap about that old slunt?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.160
I'm talking about Sergio.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.395
Anyway, who cares?

02:44.397 --> 02:46.030
It's no big deal.

02:54.173 --> 02:57.335
- Come on, Tamara, let's go.
- Just chillax.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.877
I can't believe people are
just leaving their programs.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.412
I'm sure that everyone
appreciates your devotion

03:02.414 --> 03:03.781
to the school right to the end,

03:03.783 --> 03:05.415
but you're taking some janitor's job away.

03:05.417 --> 03:08.452
I did not spend hours of hard
work on the program committee

03:08.454 --> 03:10.654
just to have my work thrown
out like an old Kleenex.

03:10.656 --> 03:12.117
So, you're saving all of them?

03:12.142 --> 03:13.624
Well, what else would I do with them?

03:13.626 --> 03:15.025
Keep one and throw the rest away

03:15.027 --> 03:17.828
like any normal,
non-hoarding high school girl?

03:17.830 --> 03:20.064
OMG, I am obsessed with "Hoarders."

03:20.066 --> 03:23.333
Some people are bat[bleep]
crazy about throwing things away.

03:23.335 --> 03:24.884
Give that back!

03:25.237 --> 03:28.405
Old homework, three composition books,

03:28.407 --> 03:32.476
an A-plus book report from freshman year?

03:32.478 --> 03:33.943
You don't need any of this, Tamara.

03:33.945 --> 03:35.746
Don't tell me what I don't need.

03:35.748 --> 03:37.281
I worked really hard on those.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.383
I am allowed to preserve and
commemorate my accomplishments.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.850
Now, give it back.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.655
- Really?
- Aww, my SAT pencil.

03:45.657 --> 03:47.190
Give it back!

03:49.485 --> 03:51.223
Hey, sweetie, where's Matty?

03:51.225 --> 03:52.925
Are you excited about grad night?

03:52.927 --> 03:54.293
Your last night of high school.

03:54.295 --> 03:55.892
Last night of a lot of things.

03:55.917 --> 03:57.367
Hey, take a spin on the Zipper for me.

03:57.392 --> 03:58.431
I love the Zipper.

03:58.433 --> 04:01.033
Ah yes, what memories
the Zipper at grad night

04:01.035 --> 04:05.070
holds for me, crying and
vomiting as it spun around.

04:05.072 --> 04:08.440
You rode the Zipper when
you were pregnant with me?

04:08.442 --> 04:10.809
Of course not, the lap
bar wouldn't fit around me.

04:10.811 --> 04:12.778
I managed to get sick
just watching your father.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.546
Hey, remember when it
got stuck all the way up?

04:14.548 --> 04:16.180
The only time any zipper in your orbit

04:16.183 --> 04:18.266
has been stuck in the up position.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.985
Jenna, look, I know this sucks,

04:20.987 --> 04:21.986
- I know you're pissed...
- We're gonna go.

04:21.988 --> 04:23.488
But we've really got to talk.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.808
Okay, so...

04:25.125 --> 04:27.792
Hey, hey, hey, guys, listen.

04:27.794 --> 04:29.294
Listen to me.

04:29.296 --> 04:31.862
Listen, life is going
to be full of challenges.

04:31.864 --> 04:35.567
You're gonna have roads to
travel and crosses to bear,

04:35.569 --> 04:36.837
crumbs to brush

04:36.862 --> 04:40.137
and hairballs to flush, but
you're gonna make it, okay?

04:40.139 --> 04:42.206
- 'Cause you're strong.
- Thanks, right back at you.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.040
Oh, never buy extended warranties.

04:44.042 --> 04:45.175
Okay, time to go.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.743
We've got a honeymoon to get to.

04:46.745 --> 04:50.180
Oh, I'm sorry, am I keeping
you from your base need

04:50.182 --> 04:52.082
to sweep me off to my marriage bed

04:52.084 --> 04:54.284
so I can perform conjugal duties?

04:54.286 --> 04:58.555
Men are such animals, but man,
once you get a taste for them?

04:58.557 --> 05:00.056
Mmm.

05:01.925 --> 05:03.892
- One more thing, J...
- Val, honeymoon.

05:03.894 --> 05:05.461
All right, all right, all right.

05:11.702 --> 05:12.768
So can we talk?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.003
Absolutely not.

05:14.005 --> 05:15.938
We only have 24 hours left, Matty.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.507
We're not gonna waste any of it talking.

05:17.509 --> 05:21.209
We have an entire
relationship to have tonight.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.211
There were so many things I
never got to do with Matty,

05:26.236 --> 05:28.203
so I was determined to
make up for lost time.

05:35.290 --> 05:37.211
- Oh!
- Ugh!

05:38.181 --> 05:40.577
I wanted us to pack as
many different experiences

05:40.602 --> 05:42.736
as we could into our last night.

05:42.738 --> 05:45.140
- Whoo hoo!
- Aah!

05:50.278 --> 05:52.246
Hoo hoo hoo ha!

05:55.883 --> 05:57.617
Why are you still carrying that thing?

05:57.619 --> 05:59.986
Because the locks on my
car are Brokedown Palace,

05:59.988 --> 06:01.521
and people are sketch.

06:01.523 --> 06:04.558
Yeah, tweakers usually pass
right over a stereo or an iPhone

06:04.560 --> 06:06.726
so they can get their
hands on some old pencils.

06:06.993 --> 06:09.362
Why do you have to be
such a Rude Boy by Rihanna?

06:09.364 --> 06:12.023
Oh, come on. Hey, T, hey.

06:12.048 --> 06:13.148
I'm sorry.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.034
Everything's changing.

06:15.036 --> 06:16.535
Adam's back at Twentynine Palms,

06:16.537 --> 06:18.203
and he's getting ready to ship out.

06:18.205 --> 06:20.218
I'm here, and I'm
getting ready to ship out.

06:20.908 --> 06:22.508
I was class president, Jake.

06:22.510 --> 06:25.077
What if I'm never president
of anything else ever again?

06:25.079 --> 06:27.012
What if... what if this was it?

06:27.014 --> 06:29.078
You have a whole new life ahead of you,

06:29.103 --> 06:33.051
a whole new world of things
to be obsessive and controlling

06:33.053 --> 06:36.315
and OCD about and to excel at.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.892
No way, red cups?

06:40.894 --> 06:43.361
Who would have the balls?

06:49.535 --> 06:50.534
Whoa.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.102
Mama needs.

06:53.972 --> 06:55.806
My treat. Come on.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.408
Hey.

06:58.410 --> 07:00.477
Oh, hold on to your allowance, Rosati.

07:00.479 --> 07:02.345
Your money's no good here.

07:02.347 --> 07:05.415
Oh, great, thanks. Why?

07:05.417 --> 07:06.683
Look at you, dude.

07:06.685 --> 07:10.086
- All downhill from here.
- What?

07:10.088 --> 07:12.321
Guys like you that wear letter jackets?

07:12.323 --> 07:13.956
This is as good as it ever gets.

07:13.958 --> 07:17.226
That jacket gets replaced with
a cheap blazer and Dockers.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.694
Middle management city.

07:18.696 --> 07:20.329
Assuming you make it
through some night classes

07:20.331 --> 07:21.564
in community college.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.633
So enjoy your last kegger on us.

07:23.635 --> 07:26.702
They won't have these at LensCrafters.

07:33.577 --> 07:36.044
I just love cotton candy so much.

07:36.046 --> 07:38.246
I wish I could fill a whole room with it,

07:38.248 --> 07:40.281
and you could just roll around in it.

07:40.283 --> 07:42.717
It'd be so cushy, except, ew,

07:42.719 --> 07:44.886
you'd probably get blue,
sticky stuff everywhere.

07:44.888 --> 07:46.354
Will you, for the love

07:46.356 --> 07:48.823
of all that is holy in
your simple little brain,

07:48.825 --> 07:50.091
shut the [bleep] up?

07:50.093 --> 07:51.359
I'm just trying to take your mind

07:51.361 --> 07:52.960
off of some of your misery and nastiness.

07:52.962 --> 07:55.363
Why would you want to take
me out of my comfort zone?

07:55.365 --> 07:57.565
So that maybe when your
night starts to get better,

07:57.567 --> 08:00.101
you won't feel bad for being
such a raving B-word to me.

08:00.103 --> 08:02.106
What are you talking about?

08:04.673 --> 08:07.224
Are you kidding me?

08:10.079 --> 08:11.612
What are you doing here?

08:11.614 --> 08:13.113
Trying to build some business

08:13.115 --> 08:14.714
and thought you might want to see me.

08:14.716 --> 08:16.015
You thought wrong.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.918
This is a high school function.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.387
You're not invited.

08:20.389 --> 08:23.223
Shouldn't you have to
have a permit or something?

08:23.225 --> 08:25.758
Seriously? You told me
she wanted to apologize.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.300
She does.

08:27.896 --> 08:29.090
Just wait here.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.500
Oh, a romantic night at the beach.

08:34.501 --> 08:36.368
Well, the real one was too windy,

08:36.370 --> 08:39.072
plus it'd be rude to bail on grad night.

08:39.073 --> 08:40.573
Okay, what do you keep doing?

08:40.575 --> 08:42.374
Checking things off our to-do list.

08:42.376 --> 08:44.943
Oh, you are very...

08:46.247 --> 08:47.779
Organized.

08:51.642 --> 08:52.940
No.

08:53.179 --> 08:54.344
Empty calories.

08:54.346 --> 08:56.446
Jenna, I am here as a friend, okay?

08:56.448 --> 08:57.647
A friend with a conscience.

08:57.649 --> 09:00.110
Comfort food is a slippery slope.

09:00.852 --> 09:02.352
You're gonna be cold in your dorm,

09:02.354 --> 09:03.446
and you're gonna be tempted

09:03.471 --> 09:05.666
by something called instant
ramen... don't do it.

09:05.691 --> 09:07.924
The sodium alone will bloat
you like nobody's business.

09:07.926 --> 09:09.492
- Okay, sorry, guys.
- Trust me.

09:09.494 --> 09:10.760
Take it from someone who couldn't fit

09:10.762 --> 09:12.962
into her shower stall freshman year!

09:12.964 --> 09:14.464
Enjoy the romance.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.388
He really wants to apologize.

09:16.735 --> 09:18.635
He told me so.

09:18.637 --> 09:21.204
He's really hurting and will
do anything to get you back.

09:21.206 --> 09:22.905
Then why didn't he just call me?

09:22.907 --> 09:26.375
Because he's probably afraid
to because you're so mean.

09:26.377 --> 09:27.743
I'm not that mean.

09:27.745 --> 09:28.845
Yes, you are!

09:28.847 --> 09:30.046
You wouldn't even let me sit with you

09:30.048 --> 09:32.248
on the scariest ride here!

09:33.838 --> 09:34.728
Official make-out session

09:34.753 --> 09:36.520
in the best make-out spot in school?

09:36.876 --> 09:37.998
Check.

09:38.985 --> 09:40.812
Nope, time for the drive-in movie.

09:40.837 --> 09:43.947
Oh, I think there's one in 1977.

09:44.389 --> 09:47.517
If we hurry to the time
machine, I think we'll make it.

09:47.542 --> 09:48.674
Come on.

09:50.431 --> 09:54.267
Okay, so I've got "Titanic,"

09:54.269 --> 09:55.935
"Pretty Woman," "Transformers"...

09:55.937 --> 09:57.636
which I'll suffer through just for you...

09:57.638 --> 09:59.605
Ooh, "Lady & The Tramp."

09:59.607 --> 10:01.841
Um, I was enjoying just making out.

10:01.843 --> 10:03.251
We're running out of time.

10:03.276 --> 10:05.088
We're gonna have to go at
this list two at a time now.

10:05.113 --> 10:08.141
Jenna, don't you think
we should talk about this?

10:08.616 --> 10:09.915
At least a little?

10:09.917 --> 10:12.018
Talking is specifically not on my list.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.516
Yeah, but it's on mine.

10:18.082 --> 10:19.566
And so it started.

10:19.591 --> 10:22.527
The conversation I'd
been avoiding all night.

10:22.582 --> 10:24.808
With no summer to
nurture this relationship,

10:24.833 --> 10:25.900
what would we do?

10:25.902 --> 10:28.602
So I mean, where do we go from here?

10:28.604 --> 10:31.620
Do you want to... I don't know, break up?

10:31.645 --> 10:32.910
No, just...

10:33.277 --> 10:35.166
I don't want to do that.

10:35.191 --> 10:37.323
- Good, neither do I.
- Breaking up would suck.

10:37.348 --> 10:38.565
We just got together.

10:38.590 --> 10:40.790
Totally suck, so let's just stay together,

10:40.792 --> 10:42.225
keep our relationship going.

10:42.227 --> 10:44.226
Yeah, let's.

10:44.829 --> 10:47.197
From opposite sides of the country.

10:47.199 --> 10:49.860
Yeah, but we can see each other, like, a...

10:50.676 --> 10:52.569
a few times a year,

10:52.571 --> 10:55.572
if our breaks line up at the same time.

10:55.574 --> 10:57.373
If we can afford plane tickets.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.120
Oh, planes suck.

11:01.012 --> 11:02.412
We could Skype.

11:02.414 --> 11:04.380
Kissing a glass tablet totally sucks.

11:04.382 --> 11:06.115
Yeah, most of these options suck.

11:06.117 --> 11:07.301
What if we did the whole,

11:07.326 --> 11:08.918
"When we're together,
we're together," thing?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.885
What about, "When we're not, we're not?"

11:11.823 --> 11:14.456
- Suckular.
- Suckfest.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.025
It was so much less complicated

11:16.027 --> 11:18.661
when I didn't know I was in love with you.

11:18.663 --> 11:20.375
Right back at you,

11:20.798 --> 11:24.215
though maybe I always knew
I was in love with you.

11:24.769 --> 11:26.265
You did?

11:27.438 --> 11:29.105
You suck.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.155
We'll figure something out.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.535
Yeah.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.316
Theo and Cole are Sid Vicious.

11:41.318 --> 11:42.584
Who cares what they think?

11:42.586 --> 11:44.386
They looked down on me,

11:44.388 --> 11:45.587
and for what?

11:45.589 --> 11:46.955
Because I have a letterman jacket?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.457
You know, I worked hard for this jacket.

11:48.459 --> 11:49.924
Oh, interesting. So would you say

11:49.926 --> 11:51.627
that you're attached to
something from your past?

11:51.629 --> 11:53.928
And so what if I'm not
going off to college?

11:53.930 --> 11:55.096
[bleep] them.

11:55.098 --> 11:56.898
They don't get to have an opinion about me.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.501
Oh, my God, Jake, you're
taking this way too seriously.

11:59.503 --> 12:01.236
- Where are you going?
- To give them a piece

12:01.238 --> 12:02.304
of my mind!

12:04.407 --> 12:06.440
Argh!

12:14.082 --> 12:15.383
Get out of the way!

12:15.385 --> 12:17.718
This is so disgusting.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.453
Really? I needed this tonight?

12:19.455 --> 12:20.655
It will wash off.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.289
It's someone else's puke, Tamara!

12:22.291 --> 12:25.358
And... and...

12:25.360 --> 12:26.493
Don't.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.329
Okay, dramz alert.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.997
Jake, come on, that's your jacket.

12:30.999 --> 12:34.620
Was my jacket, and that
jacket is not who I am.

12:34.645 --> 12:36.948
You're overreacting to some dumb comment.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.606
High school has left the building.

12:38.608 --> 12:40.975
You're totes mangling
quotes. It's annoying.

12:40.977 --> 12:44.278
As annoying as carrying
a bag of old programs?

12:44.280 --> 12:46.246
And what is that?

12:46.248 --> 12:47.414
A pom-pom?

12:47.416 --> 12:49.015
It was under the bleachers.

12:49.017 --> 12:50.355
I had to.

12:51.620 --> 12:52.898
Oh, my God.

12:53.255 --> 12:56.222
I'm standing here holding
a shriveled-up pom-pom.

12:56.224 --> 12:58.530
Jake, this is not who I am.

13:00.095 --> 13:01.366
That a girl.

13:03.464 --> 13:05.331
Yeah, get rid of all of it.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.246
Here, I'll help.

13:07.502 --> 13:10.068
Stupid composition books.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.609
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

13:16.611 --> 13:17.976
Okay, you're wasting my time.

13:17.978 --> 13:19.824
And you're wasting mine.

13:19.849 --> 13:22.558
Lissa said you were hurting
and needed to tell me something?

13:22.583 --> 13:23.749
Well, Lissa said you were hurting

13:23.751 --> 13:25.750
and wanted to tell me something.

13:25.752 --> 13:27.318
Lissa?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.621
Okay, okay, but it's technically true.

13:29.623 --> 13:31.823
You guys do both have something
you want to say to the other,

13:31.825 --> 13:33.816
even if you won't say it.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.693
No, don't... don't go.

13:35.695 --> 13:36.887
Don't go.

13:37.830 --> 13:40.096
This should absolutely be working.

13:40.098 --> 13:41.765
It totally worked in "The Parent Trap."

13:41.767 --> 13:43.434
Lissa, keep your moronic Disney

13:43.436 --> 13:45.469
wish fulfillment for your own life.

13:45.471 --> 13:46.804
I tried it with Mommy and Daddy,

13:46.806 --> 13:48.939
and it almost worked
except Daddy's too gay,

13:48.941 --> 13:52.609
but they're friends now,
and since Sergio's not gay

13:52.611 --> 13:53.944
this should be working, darn it!

13:53.946 --> 13:56.212
That is literally the stupidest thing

13:56.214 --> 13:57.247
I've ever heard.

13:57.249 --> 13:58.883
Sadita, don't be rude.

13:59.184 --> 14:01.463
But yeah, beyond dumb.

14:02.421 --> 14:03.895
Loco.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.710
- Do you have any tomatillo?
- Get the [bleep] out of here!

14:08.125 --> 14:10.020
Stand down, Lissa.

14:10.730 --> 14:13.029
I've missed some of your rudeness.

14:13.031 --> 14:15.521
And I missed your tomatillo breath.

14:18.502 --> 14:20.109
I love "The Parent Trap."

14:20.472 --> 14:22.159
Want to make out?

14:25.409 --> 14:27.777
Here lies the red cup,

14:27.779 --> 14:30.279
symbolizing my quest

14:30.281 --> 14:34.951
for popularity, my
desperate need to fit in.

14:34.953 --> 14:36.218
Nope.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.487
I feel good about this, Jake.

14:37.489 --> 14:38.921
I think we've come a long way.

14:38.923 --> 14:41.723
I'm kind of glad we're together tonight.

14:41.725 --> 14:43.573
Oh, gee, thanks.

14:43.598 --> 14:46.227
I just mean there's no one better

14:46.229 --> 14:47.929
to close out high school with.

14:47.931 --> 14:54.202
I... yeah, I kind of wouldn't
want to be with anyone else.

15:03.712 --> 15:05.020
Hey.

15:05.448 --> 15:07.615
Are we interrupting something?

15:07.617 --> 15:09.049
Only the last moments

15:09.051 --> 15:11.565
of the most profound realz I've ever had,

15:11.590 --> 15:14.385
the life-altering
conclusions about who I am,

15:14.410 --> 15:18.386
and the bold choices I have made
to celebrate those conclusions.

15:18.411 --> 15:20.488
She dumped a bunch of her old [bleep].

15:20.513 --> 15:22.113
Oh, awesome.

15:22.115 --> 15:23.448
Now just throw Hamilturd in there,

15:23.450 --> 15:25.605
- and it'll be a clean sweep.
- Sadita.

15:25.622 --> 15:26.979
Sadie, not the best time.

15:27.004 --> 15:28.657
God, lighten up, everyone.

15:28.659 --> 15:31.126
It's okay, guys. She's just making a joke.

15:31.128 --> 15:34.063
I didn't mean to really
throw you in the dumpster.

15:34.065 --> 15:35.863
Why is everyone being so weird tonight?

15:35.865 --> 15:37.299
We're out of this [bleep]hole.

15:37.301 --> 15:40.555
We have the entire summer
to do anything we want.

15:45.040 --> 15:49.110
That didn't feel as good as
I always thought it would.

15:50.145 --> 15:51.290
Hey.

15:53.116 --> 15:54.625
It's no use.

15:54.851 --> 15:56.017
What's the point?

15:56.019 --> 15:58.553
You're gone in the morning.

15:58.555 --> 16:00.121
Maybe if we'd had a summer...

16:00.123 --> 16:02.440
What if I... I blow off soccer camp?

16:02.465 --> 16:08.015
No, this is just the way things are.

16:09.299 --> 16:12.534
We've always had bad timing,

16:12.536 --> 16:16.437
and this time it's nobody's fault,

16:16.439 --> 16:17.905
- but...
- But?

16:17.907 --> 16:22.777
Maybe it would be easier
for both of us if we...

16:28.551 --> 16:29.717
Yeah.

16:50.316 --> 16:51.704
I spent the night alone.

16:51.729 --> 16:53.972
I was probably the stupidest
thing I'd ever done,

16:53.982 --> 16:55.105
or the smartest.

16:55.130 --> 16:57.309
All I wanted was for Matty
to knock on that door,

16:57.325 --> 16:59.192
to tell me that he wasn't leaving

16:59.194 --> 17:01.660
and that it wasn't
unfair of me to want that.

17:04.564 --> 17:06.263
Surprise.

17:06.266 --> 17:08.532
Oh, God, not now, please?

17:08.535 --> 17:09.934
It's not a good time.

17:09.935 --> 17:11.502
This will only take a few minutes,

17:11.505 --> 17:13.137
but it is an important few minutes.

17:13.138 --> 17:14.972
I thought of a few more things.

17:14.973 --> 17:18.242
First, floss is your friend, okay?

17:18.244 --> 17:21.345
- You do not...
- And she went on and on.

17:21.347 --> 17:22.332
Eat organic.

17:22.357 --> 17:25.459
You will be shocked at
the volume in your stool...

17:25.483 --> 17:26.718
And on.

17:26.720 --> 17:30.215
Trust your heart, because
every moment counts.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.305
Also, be wary of llamas.

17:35.328 --> 17:36.635
Well...

17:37.197 --> 17:43.033
that's all I got, J-Town, so happy trails,

17:43.035 --> 17:46.858
and you have a good life.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.480
It was a miracle.

17:49.504 --> 17:51.304
It had taken four long years,

17:51.329 --> 17:53.940
but something Val said actually resonated.

17:53.965 --> 17:57.343
"Trust your heart, because
every moment counts."

17:57.345 --> 17:58.863
Val?

17:59.547 --> 18:00.908
Thank you.

18:14.863 --> 18:16.643
Do you have everything you need?

18:16.668 --> 18:19.001
Yeah, almost.

18:19.027 --> 18:20.761
You better... you better get on the road,

18:20.763 --> 18:22.429
- or you're gonna...
- I will, Mom. I will.

18:22.431 --> 18:24.865
I just... I have to take
care of something first.

18:24.867 --> 18:26.066
Oh.

18:31.739 --> 18:32.906
Jenna?

18:33.926 --> 18:35.692
Matty, we were wrong.

18:35.694 --> 18:36.879
We can make this work.

18:36.904 --> 18:39.006
I have no clue how, and
you have no clue how,

18:39.031 --> 18:40.865
and it's okay to be completely clueless.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.399
- But what if...
- Well, what if?

18:42.401 --> 18:44.433
Life is just a series of moments,

18:44.435 --> 18:48.471
and every moment in life counts
no matter what the outcome is,

18:48.473 --> 18:52.441
and I want to spend as many of
those moments as I can with you.

18:59.351 --> 19:04.019
Jenna, these moments, they're
counting down pretty fast.

19:04.387 --> 19:07.522
We'll just have to find a
way to squeeze out a few more.

19:12.128 --> 19:13.295
Got room for another?

19:13.297 --> 19:14.796
You're both pretty small.

19:14.798 --> 19:17.532
I think we can make room.

19:19.369 --> 19:23.010
- Bye, Miss McKibben.
- Bye. Love you, Mom.

19:23.035 --> 19:24.979
It was 15 hours to Berkeley.

19:25.004 --> 19:27.246
At least that's what we told each other.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.242
Really, it was seven.

19:36.723 --> 19:37.957
- Aah!
- Ah!

19:37.959 --> 19:39.385
Give me that.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.175
Whoa...

19:42.898 --> 19:44.297
No peeking.

19:44.299 --> 19:46.132
But when you drive slow...

19:49.104 --> 19:51.286
And stop for gas all the time,

19:53.308 --> 19:55.151
and grab dinner,

19:56.344 --> 19:57.701
and hit traffic...

19:58.146 --> 20:00.284
Oh, thank God for traffic...

20:02.283 --> 20:04.123
the hours add up.

20:04.554 --> 20:06.120
Hey, there's Berkeley.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.794
And the moments slip away.

20:10.358 --> 20:12.525
Matty and I still had a lot to figure out,

20:12.527 --> 20:14.593
but we knew that somehow we would.

20:14.618 --> 20:16.207
We'd jumped through too many hoops

20:16.232 --> 20:18.398
to let a little thing like
distance come between us.

20:18.793 --> 20:21.534
We wouldn't let it, because deep down

20:21.559 --> 20:23.892
we knew that love would conquer all.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.390
Of course, that's not quite what happened.
