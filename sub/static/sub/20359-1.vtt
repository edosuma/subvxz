02:17.887 --> 02:19.680
- Victor.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.974
Victor!
Victor, come on!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.643
Ooph!

02:24.769 --> 02:25.811
Bad dog.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.616
Charles!

02:39.742 --> 02:40.784
- Oh, hi.

02:40.910 --> 02:41.952
Oh, what have you been doing?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.787
There's South American stamps
on here.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.623
You must know somebody
in Uruguay, Mr. Razaghi.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.584
- Sort of.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.127
- I hope it's good news.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.295
- Thank you.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.801
- "We do not see the need
for an authorized

02:57.927 --> 03:00.512
"biography of Jules Gund
at this time,

03:00.638 --> 03:02.598
nor at any time in the future"?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.266
- Why would they
deny me authorization?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.767
It's not like
everyone in the world

03:05.894 --> 03:09.646
is working on a biography
of Jules Gund.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.148
- Which one is Caroline Gund?

03:11.274 --> 03:12.441
- The widow.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.485
There's a daughter too,
but she didn't sign.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.529
- So who's Arden Langdon?

03:17.655 --> 03:21.909
- She's the uh...
mistress, I guess.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.660
Adam Gund, that's the brother.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.746
And Ocho Rios is the place

03:25.872 --> 03:28.081
where they all lived together
when Jules Gund was alive.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.499
- That's quite a setup:

03:29.626 --> 03:33.420
the brother, the widow,
the lover, a daughter.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.673
That's probably why they don't
want to authorize a biography.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.260
It's too tortured
and incestuous.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.512
Wait.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.681
"Your request has prompted
much discussion

03:44.807 --> 03:47.017
amongst the trustees."

03:47.143 --> 03:50.395
That could mean
they don't all agree.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.994
You'll have to go to Uruguay.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.371
- What?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.872
After that letter?

04:08.998 --> 04:10.165
- Confront the three executors

04:10.291 --> 04:11.959
and make them
change their minds.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.794
It may be easier than you think.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.212
- But they said "no."

04:15.338 --> 04:17.255
- Mm.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.423
You know perfectly well

04:18.548 --> 04:20.132
that without
getting their permission,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.469
there's no fellowship, no money,
no biography,

04:22.595 --> 04:26.306
and no new contract for you
at the university.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.685
Omar, you'll never
get another teaching job.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.729
And what else can you do?

04:32.855 --> 04:33.981
- Nothing.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.274
- Exactly.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.042
I forgot to heat the milk.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.419
Do you think it matters?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.839
- I've never heard of a sublet
that comes with a dog,

04:58.965 --> 05:01.174
and one
with such an elaborate diet.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.854
- How could you do that,
fall in a puddle?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.105
- It wasn't a puddle.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.607
It was quicksand.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.775
- For you, it's quicksand.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.278
For everyone else,
it's a puddle.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.113
It's like you have this
subconscious drive

05:23.239 --> 05:28.785
to fall in, to mess up.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.454
I think I should come with you

05:30.580 --> 05:32.414
to Uruguay.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.333
I've had more experience
with things like that.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.500
- No.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.252
I think I should go by myself,

05:37.378 --> 05:41.465
if I decide to go.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.467
- Well, if you decide to go,

05:43.593 --> 05:46.636
I think it would be better
for us to do it together.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.807
Better for us
individually and as a couple.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.101
- I think it'll be better
for both of us

05:53.227 --> 05:54.936
individually and as a couple

05:55.063 --> 05:56.772
if I were to go by myself.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.899
But I appreciate your offer.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.942
- You appreciate my offer?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.986
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.114
- Omar, it's me, Deirdre.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.742
You don't appreciate my offer.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.536
- I almost drowned in quicksand.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.622
I saw my life
flash before my eyes,

06:13.748 --> 06:17.292
and I did not like what I saw.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.294
I've decided to change my life.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.214
I have to be,
you know, more independent.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.590
Like other people.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.402
- I don't want you
to be like other people,

06:43.528 --> 06:45.112
to change.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.664
- Oh, what's wrong, buddy?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.666
You want to go outside?
Let's go outside.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.834
Come on.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.001
Come on!

07:00.128 --> 07:01.878
Oh.
Buddy.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.004
- Hopeless.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.132
- Out you go.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.939
- If you fly to Miami first,

07:21.065 --> 07:24.192
it's nonstop from there
to Montevideo.

07:24.318 --> 07:28.822
But that's horribly expensive.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.282
- What about Victor?

07:30.408 --> 07:31.741
- He's not your dog.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.909
We'll put him in a pound.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.745
Most of them
have a 30-day grace period.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.539
You can redeem him
when you get back.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.291
- Deirdre,

07:39.417 --> 07:40.459
he's part of the house-sit.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.626
I'm responsible for him.

07:41.752 --> 07:47.591
We can't just throw him
in the pound.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.134
- Ah, this is better.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.261
From Houston to Sao Paulo,

07:51.387 --> 07:53.472
then Montevideo.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.891
For some reason,
it's much cheaper.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.311
Ah, it takes much longer.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.062
Don't do that now.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.530
I'm hurt.

08:54.784 --> 08:55.825
- SeÃ±or.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.953
- Si.
- Por favor.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.386
- Are you coming to Ocho Rios?

10:38.512 --> 10:39.554
That's my house.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.848
- You speak English.
- Of course.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.183
And Spanish.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.601
- I'm Omar.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.269
Omar Razaghi.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.437
- I'm Portia.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.439
Why are you coming to Ocho Rios?

10:49.565 --> 10:50.899
- I want to write a book.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.361
I want to write a biography
about Jules Gund.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.029
Have you heard of him?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.614
- He was my father.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.699
- Your father?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.159
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.885
This is Omar.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.303
He's writing a book.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.722
This is my mother.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.515
- Mrs. Gund?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.600
I'm Omar Razaghi.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.935
I wrote you the letter

12:09.061 --> 12:10.311
about the biography.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.148
- My name's Arden Langdon.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.483
Caroline...

12:15.609 --> 12:18.653
she's Mrs. Gund.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.946
But we wrote to you.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.114
We said no.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.657
We very definitely said no.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.160
- Yes, that's why I'm here.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.746
I'm hoping
you'll change your minds.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.789
I guess
I should have written first.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.375
It was very wrong of me
to come like this.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.210
I have to find a hotel.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.587
- Where?

12:35.713 --> 12:38.506
There's nothing except
this place for miles and miles.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.426
- I can sleep outdoors
in the garden,

12:41.552 --> 12:42.594
if you'll let me.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.762
- Don't be ridiculous.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.929
Now that you're here,

12:45.055 --> 12:46.514
there's nowhere else
for you to go,

12:46.640 --> 12:49.184
so till we can get you
back into town,

12:49.310 --> 12:50.852
we'll have to let you stay.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.562
- Really?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.491
- Mad women and Englishmen:

13:46.617 --> 13:49.327
why they would want to walk here
in the sun is beyond me.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.915
Of course, those two ladies
are always beyond me.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.545
Can you help me with my cravat,
please?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.255
You know,
I've always liked this cravat.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.799
I bought it in Venice in 1966.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.300
I must have been happy
at the time.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.720
Otherwise, why would I have
bought such a beautiful thing?

14:07.847 --> 14:12.058
I look very handsome in that.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.602
- They're walking like...

14:14.728 --> 14:16.062
they're bringing important news.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.898
- Oh, what news?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.985
Great tidings at Ocho Rios.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.320
They do look serious,
don't they?

14:24.446 --> 14:26.573
Supposing we...

14:26.699 --> 14:29.492
stuck by our decision
to refuse authorization.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.995
- Then he shall have come
very far for nothing.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.998
- Yes, but he can still
write the biography

14:35.124 --> 14:36.499
without authorization.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.252
That is,
without our help and consent.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.504
That would give him
quite a free hand, wouldn't it?

14:41.630 --> 14:43.339
To make up things,
to make up stories,

14:43.465 --> 14:45.091
twist the facts.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.426
You know, once these people,

14:46.552 --> 14:48.094
these biographers
turn against you,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.179
they can become quite vicious.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.016
- Oh, he didn't look
as if he could ever be that.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.893
- How do you know?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.311
You only saw him
for five minutes

14:56.437 --> 14:58.688
before at once
inviting him to stay.

14:58.814 --> 15:02.609
- He looked so tired
and helpless somehow.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.776
- And young and handsome.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.111
- Oh, really?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.654
- That has nothing
to do with it.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.365
- Anyway, Jules said he didn't
want a biography of himself.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.702
He said it was like having
one's corpse publicly exhumed.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.538
- Oh, when did he say that?

15:15.664 --> 15:17.206
- In a letter to me years ago.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.459
- My god.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.836
Well, if we were
held accountable

15:21.962 --> 15:24.130
for the things we wrote in
letters millions of years ago,

15:24.256 --> 15:25.882
my dear,
where would any of us be?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.508
But he must have told you
other things.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.552
Um, for instance,
that he would be married

15:29.678 --> 15:32.055
and faithful to you
forever and ever.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.389
- He was.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.391
He stayed married to me.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.643
- Oh.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.145
And Arden didn't count,
or Portia?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.898
- Caroline didn't say that.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.245
The days pass,
and we live together,

15:56.372 --> 15:57.830
Caroline and I,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.332
and we manage it.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.834
Quite well, I think.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.586
And now this.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.591
Adam's so moody nowadays.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.426
- It's because of you.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.972
He's afraid you'll leave him.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.557
I used to live like that,

16:16.684 --> 16:21.562
always afraid
that Jules would leave me.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.399
He'd get into those black moods,

16:24.525 --> 16:28.277
not speak to me for days on end,

16:28.404 --> 16:29.904
not to anyone,

16:30.030 --> 16:32.281
not to Caroline.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.284
And I thought
that she'd turn against me

16:35.411 --> 16:37.954
and get him to send me away.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.497
Where would I go?

16:40.916 --> 16:42.375
Where would I go?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.336
- That's all in the past.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.466
- Yes, it's strange.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.636
Everything's easier.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.638
But now
when some stranger arrives...

16:55.764 --> 16:57.640
- Is he young and handsome?

16:57.766 --> 17:00.685
- It depends
what you mean by that.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.937
Can you find any more teaspoons?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.194
How can we just send him away?

17:11.320 --> 17:13.239
Tell him,
"Good-bye; go home"?

17:13.365 --> 17:14.406
- We're not.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.117
We're even letting him stay
in the house.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.660
We're being very friendly.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.788
- But then he might start to
think we've changed our minds.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.248
- That's his problem.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.291
I can be friendly
without changing my mind.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.211
- Well, he must have come here
with such hope.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.547
- Let's think about this.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.008
A biography would stimulate
interest in Jules' work,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.385
and that is something that we,
as his executors,

17:34.511 --> 17:35.845
should encourage.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.432
Anyway, let's not make
any hasty decisions, shall we?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.726
- My decision's made,
and it's not hasty.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.730
And Arden, for her own reasons,
is on my side.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.315
You are, aren't you?

17:47.441 --> 17:48.649
Yes, you are.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.903
So that's two
against one, Adam.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.571
- Well, I refuse
to be guided by anything

17:53.697 --> 17:56.365
as stupid as democracy.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.790
- Portia.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.254
Mustn't disturb him.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.632
- Are we gonna whisper
all night?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.425
Hmm?

18:14.551 --> 18:17.053
- He's come a long way.
He must be tired.

18:53.841 --> 19:01.597
âª âª

19:07.729 --> 19:13.276
âª âª

19:13.402 --> 19:14.443
- Hello?

19:14.570 --> 19:15.778
- Hello?

19:15.904 --> 19:17.947
I would like to speak
to Omar Razaghi, please.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.115
- Dee!

19:19.241 --> 19:20.533
- Omar?
- Hi.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.701
How did you get this number?

19:21.827 --> 19:22.869
- You don't sound like Omar.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.036
Are you eating something?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.454
- Yes, bread and honey.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.622
- What?

19:26.748 --> 19:27.790
- Honey.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.792
- Darling, I miss you too.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.627
But you won't be away long.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.795
What's it like there?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.130
I guess they're all pretty old.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.756
I only hope they're not senile.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.633
- Well, it might take longer
than we thought.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.552
- Can't you stop eating
for a minute?

19:39.678 --> 19:40.928
- We have a very bad connection.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.973
- I told you to get a cell phone
when you went down there.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.975
It could have come
out of the fellowship money.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.812
- Are you there?
Dee?

19:49.938 --> 19:50.980
- Omar?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.652
- Dee, are you there?

19:56.778 --> 19:57.862
- Hello?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.488
click!

20:06.371 --> 20:07.997
- Thank you for the bread
and the honey.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.916
It was delicious.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.751
- It's from our own bees.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.502
You know anything about bees?

20:13.629 --> 20:15.171
- Bees.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.839
I know they live in an apiary,

20:16.965 --> 20:19.175
a word derived from apis,

20:19.301 --> 20:22.678
which is Latin for "bee."

20:22.804 --> 20:24.764
This is not
very interesting information.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.020
- I can't believe it.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.105
You read a book and you think
all about the place,

20:33.232 --> 20:34.941
but you don't really think
that it exists,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.442
let alone that you'll be there.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.444
âª âª

20:38.570 --> 20:39.612
Let me help you with that.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.030
- Oh.

20:47.829 --> 20:55.836
âª âª

20:59.508 --> 21:00.967
- Coming here, to Ocho Rios,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.552
was like coming
to my first home,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.638
the first I ever had.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.806
My parents were divorced,

21:06.932 --> 21:09.809
and I went back and forth
between them.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.811
No one really cared.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.230
They both died in plane crashes,

21:14.356 --> 21:15.982
two different planes.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.650
He was on his way to Prague

21:17.776 --> 21:20.069
for one of his
not very successful films,

21:20.195 --> 21:22.488
and Mother
was going to Hong Kong

21:22.614 --> 21:25.241
to get married...
again.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.575
- All the years in America,

21:26.702 --> 21:28.995
my parents wanted to go back
to Tehran,

21:29.121 --> 21:30.246
but it never worked out.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.414
- What did they do?

21:31.540 --> 21:32.665
- They were doctors,

21:32.791 --> 21:34.500
pediatricians.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.752
They died
four years ago.

21:36.878 --> 21:41.382
First my mother, then my father
after a few months.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.844
So we're both orphans.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.179
- I think I was born an orphan.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.850
I was 18 when Jules
first brought me here.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.768
That was ten years ago.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.770
- I was 18 ten years ago.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.355
You and I are the same age,

21:56.481 --> 21:57.523
born at the same time.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.066
We could be brother and sister.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.234
- Twins.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.863
Only twins
can be born at the same time.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.115
- Oh.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.742
I am Omar Razaghi.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.952
- Yes, I know who you are,
my friend.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.120
You're the biographer

22:11.246 --> 22:14.290
who showed up
in spite of our letter.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.750
And what are you giving him?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.335
Oh, what-tea?

22:17.461 --> 22:18.627
Oh, really, Arden,

22:18.754 --> 22:20.755
you'll have to give him
something better than that

22:20.881 --> 22:22.465
to compensate
for his long journey here

22:22.591 --> 22:23.632
and back.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.426
How about some champagne?

22:25.552 --> 22:26.677
- Champagne?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.137
At this time of day?

22:28.263 --> 22:31.640
- Well, is there a special
time of the day for champagne?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.768
Well, if so, it is now.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.353
Hmm?

22:42.736 --> 22:44.153
You're flirting with him.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.321
- What?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.655
- When you start opening up

22:46.782 --> 22:49.158
the beautiful secrets
of your past-

22:49.284 --> 22:51.452
"I was born an orphan"-

22:51.578 --> 22:53.579
that's flirting.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.456
- Caroline,
try not to tease and provoke.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.291
- Oh, come on.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.001
How often do we have a guest,

22:59.127 --> 23:00.836
even an uninvited one?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.636
- I may not
make it back tonight.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.970
- Why not?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.138
- Business,

23:11.264 --> 23:13.307
as you know perfectly well.

23:13.433 --> 23:16.143
- I know your business
perfectly well:

23:16.269 --> 23:20.731
antique furniture,
and some of it not so antique.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.400
- We need to raise some cash.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.901
- I know.

23:24.027 --> 23:28.155
- Land taxes are due
next month.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.241
You have all this land;

23:30.367 --> 23:32.493
you pay big taxes on it.
- Mm-hmm.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.787
- You don't try
to make it work for you.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.002
Sorry to spoil your mood,

23:42.129 --> 23:44.255
but try and be sensible.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.589
- I'm willing to be sensible,

23:45.715 --> 23:47.299
but can you imagine
the other two

23:47.426 --> 23:48.884
ever agreeing to anything?

23:49.010 --> 23:50.177
I mean, look what's happening

23:50.303 --> 23:52.847
with this
foolish little biography,

23:52.973 --> 23:56.434
which, for all I know,
could be to our advantage.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.519
But Caroline's only pleasure
left in life

23:58.645 --> 24:00.604
is to say "no" to everything.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.274
And as for poor Arden,
well...

24:06.570 --> 24:11.115
I wish you had more of a life
of your own.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.283
- I do have.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.410
- Yeah.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.121
It saddens me.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.915
I think I was wrong
to bring you here.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.042
Sorry.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.210
Hey.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.571
- Hola!

24:53.742 --> 24:54.825
Ah.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.619
Hello, darling.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.786
Champagne.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.998
Is there a little drop
for me left, do you think?

25:01.124 --> 25:03.083
Ah, the guest.
- Hello, sir.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.502
- Mr. Ragazi
received our letter,

25:04.628 --> 25:06.295
but as you see,
it did not discourage him

25:06.421 --> 25:08.839
from coming to visit,
so now we're all having a party.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.090
- Oh.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.092
Well, then we must show
Mr. Razaghi-Omar, may I?

25:12.219 --> 25:13.344
- Oh, please.
- Omar.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.888
Yes, we must show Omar
what fine hosts we can be

25:16.014 --> 25:17.640
if, by some miracle,
a guest is washed up

25:17.766 --> 25:19.183
on our lonely shore.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.477
Huh?
What do you say?

25:21.603 --> 25:22.645
A picture show.

25:22.771 --> 25:23.812
Yes, why not?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.648
Portia proposes a picture show.

25:25.774 --> 25:26.982
Her one and only picture show.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.570
Go and show uncle Omar
where the projector is.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.241
Ocho Rios pictures presents...

25:35.367 --> 25:37.159
the Gunds.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.578
Ah.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.916
- This is very unwise,

25:44.042 --> 25:46.001
as if we're suddenly
his collaborators.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.753
- Well, we're not
showing him anything

25:47.879 --> 25:49.505
he doesn't already know, are we?

25:49.631 --> 25:52.091
After all, Jules' book
was not exactly reticent

25:52.217 --> 25:55.261
about our family affairs,
was it?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.929
Champagne.

25:57.055 --> 26:01.016
- I'll get you a glass.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.518
- So...

26:02.644 --> 26:05.187
how are you, my dear?

26:05.313 --> 26:06.522
- Peachy.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.649
- Peachy.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.243
Our parents brought
all this film footage

26:19.369 --> 26:20.452
with them from Germany,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.538
and they used to sit
and watch it

26:22.664 --> 26:24.123
the way we're doing now,

26:24.249 --> 26:29.628
drinking champagne.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.548
When they had to leave Germany
and became refugees,

26:32.674 --> 26:34.008
they were allowed
to settle here,

26:34.134 --> 26:35.217
in Uruguay

26:35.343 --> 26:37.136
on condition
that they bought all this land

26:37.262 --> 26:40.723
and developed it for a mine.

26:40.849 --> 26:44.977
My parents
always traveled in style,

26:45.103 --> 26:49.231
even when they were fleeing
Mr. Hitler and his Nazis.

26:49.357 --> 26:52.484
Always traveled first class.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.820
We lived here
the way they had done in Europe.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.405
We lived in the past,

26:56.531 --> 26:58.157
their past.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.159
They didn't want to know
about the present,

27:00.285 --> 27:02.119
any present anywhere.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.746
South America's
very good for that

27:03.872 --> 27:06.248
if you're a rich foreigner.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.110
- That's my grandfather.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.862
- They never
spoke German again...

27:39.991 --> 27:41.742
âª âª

27:41.868 --> 27:42.951
Not even to each other.

27:43.078 --> 27:47.831
âª âª

27:47.957 --> 27:50.584
- There's mysterious Aunt Sarah.

27:50.710 --> 27:55.798
She left for India
to follow her guru.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.049
Ugh.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.219
There she is,
signing away the family fortune.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.932
âª âª

28:05.058 --> 28:07.726
They went to Venice
for their honeymoon.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.813
And after that,
they went every year

28:10.939 --> 28:14.525
for as long
as it was still possible.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.861
But then the gondola
was the epitome of Europe,

28:17.987 --> 28:19.405
of their Europe.

28:24.244 --> 28:27.454
They persuaded the gondolier
to sell them his gondola.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.289
They called it
the honeymoon gondola

28:29.416 --> 28:33.293
and they had it shipped
all the way from the Adriatic,

28:33.420 --> 28:34.962
right across the Atlantic,

28:35.088 --> 28:36.797
here to Montevideo.

28:39.926 --> 28:47.349
âª âª

28:47.475 --> 28:51.937
Their maddest
and saddest enterprise maybe.

28:56.443 --> 29:00.529
But you've heard all about
our gondola from Jules' book.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.532
It's still here with us,
rotting in the boathouse.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.540
- Buenos dias.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.417
- I'm Pete.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.710
You must be Omar.

29:14.836 --> 29:15.878
- Yes.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.421
Hello.

29:17.547 --> 29:18.589
- Hi.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.300
- I'm looking
for the mill house.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.553
Miss Langdon said
it was down this way somewhere.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.972
Mr. Gund has invited me
to lunch.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.767
- He has?

29:29.893 --> 29:31.477
He hasn't told me.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.771
I'm the one who does the cooking
around here.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.608
I haven't bought anything.

29:37.734 --> 29:41.945
He'll have to take you
to the parilla.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.989
There is no other place.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.741
- Do they take Visa?

29:45.867 --> 29:47.910
- Don't worry about that.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.079
Adam always picks up the tab.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.999
He's very generous.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.126
Get in.

29:56.252 --> 30:01.089
It's a mile away.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.425
This is where I found him,

30:03.551 --> 30:05.093
Jules,

30:05.220 --> 30:07.137
by that big palm.

30:07.263 --> 30:10.474
I was the one who found him.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.103
- So near to the house?

30:15.230 --> 30:16.438
- Come on.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.158
Blew the top of his head
right off.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.494
I'm glad it was me
who found him

30:30.620 --> 30:34.164
and not one of the others.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.292
The odd thing
is that we all stayed here.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.005
- No, thank you.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.508
- Anyway,

30:44.634 --> 30:46.635
here we all are...

30:46.761 --> 30:48.178
including me.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.390
- Where are you from originally?

30:51.516 --> 30:54.518
- From Tokunoshima.

30:54.644 --> 30:57.187
A small island.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.566
I was poor with no family.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.318
When I was 14,

31:03.444 --> 31:06.780
someone liked me enough
to take me with him to England.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.497
Here.

31:15.623 --> 31:20.085
I find this old furniture
and make it look older.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.839
A lady comes twice a year
from New York and buys it.

31:23.965 --> 31:28.844
She says I have a good eye.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.638
Adam used to work at Christie's
in London.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.682
- Hello, Mr. Gund.
- Hello.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.517
- He sent me to a school there

31:35.643 --> 31:37.436
where I learned everything
about furniture.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.771
That was 25 years ago.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.273
- Yes.

31:41.399 --> 31:45.027
We're about to have our
silver anniversary, aren't we?

31:45.153 --> 31:47.154
Ready?
Should we go?

31:50.992 --> 31:52.951
I've ordered us
a platter of grilled meat

31:53.077 --> 31:54.202
and some red wine.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.370
- Not too much for me.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.039
I'm a bit of a lightweight,
I'm afraid.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.042
- Really?
How sad.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.544
What about all those
drunken Persian poets of yours?

32:02.670 --> 32:05.380
What about Hafez?

32:05.506 --> 32:06.548
"Bring me a cup of red wine

32:06.674 --> 32:08.634
that is dark red
and smells of musk..."

32:08.760 --> 32:10.427
- "Don't bring me
that expensive stuff..."

32:10.553 --> 32:11.720
- "That tastes like money..."

32:11.846 --> 32:13.055
"And smells like lust."

32:16.184 --> 32:18.810
So now, about the biography.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.313
Please understand,
unlike my two sisters-in-law,

32:21.439 --> 32:22.731
or the two ladies,
I should say,

32:22.857 --> 32:23.899
I'm on your side.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.817
- You are?
- Entirely on your side.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.486
See, I've been trying
to explain to them

32:27.612 --> 32:30.155
that to revive an interest
in Jules Gund and his work,

32:30.281 --> 32:32.741
a biography
would be invaluable to us.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.534
- Well, if only
I could convince everyone.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.161
I would be very respectful
of the past,

32:36.287 --> 32:37.329
everyone's feelings.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.247
- My dear boy,
he was my brother.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.916
I knew him better than anyone.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.250
I knew him when we were still

32:42.377 --> 32:44.294
tearing the wings
off butterflies.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.545
I was eight years older,

32:45.672 --> 32:48.507
but it was he who invented
all the little torments

32:48.633 --> 32:50.342
an older brother
inflicts on the younger.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.219
We were both sent to school
in England.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.470
I was utterly miserable,

32:53.596 --> 32:55.681
but he, when in a system,
was in his element.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.266
I suspect it was there at school
that he began to learn

32:58.393 --> 33:01.520
how to exert power
over those who adored him.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.440
It's that simple.

33:05.566 --> 33:09.611
So we must work together,
you and I.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.780
We must co-conspire.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.408
I hadn't thought of conspiring.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.742
- Well, of course not.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.581
Ah!

33:21.708 --> 33:23.250
Gracias.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.418
- Ooh!

33:36.723 --> 33:37.764
- This is Mrs. Van Euwen.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.225
The chatelaine
of Las Golondrinas,

33:40.351 --> 33:41.476
our local grand dame.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.769
Very grand.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.818
- Local color, you know?

33:49.944 --> 33:52.154
I told them all they would see
was red meat.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.363
- Yes.

33:55.783 --> 33:56.825
- Worse,

33:56.951 --> 33:59.619
why do you keep your new friend
away from me?

33:59.746 --> 34:01.455
- Oh, yes, he's very beautiful,
isn't he?

34:01.581 --> 34:03.123
Yes, I thought
you'd be interested.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.751
This is-
he's blushing.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.169
- Ooh!
- This is Omar Razaghi.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.337
He's come to do research
on my brother's biography.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.422
- Mucho gusto.
- Ah!

34:11.549 --> 34:13.132
Then you must research me.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.177
I can tell you
things about Jules

34:15.303 --> 34:16.969
that a brother
could never know...

34:17.096 --> 34:18.847
or a wife or even a mistress.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.476
You should write his life,
his and Pete's.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.271
That a more interesting story,
yeah.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.481
- Go away.
Go away.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.149
Thank you.
- I go. I go.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.110
You should come
to Las Golondrinas.

34:48.543 --> 34:49.628
- Have a sausage.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.004
- Is it pork?

34:51.130 --> 34:52.172
- Maybe.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.340
I don't know.

34:55.134 --> 34:59.179
You don't drink;
you hardly eat meat.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.515
Um...well, as I said before,

35:01.641 --> 35:02.682
I know I can trust you.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.017
I feel I can ask you
for your help

35:04.143 --> 35:06.394
as you're asking for mine.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.064
- Like I said, I'll do anything.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.066
- Wait, wait,
this is non-literary.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.735
It's nothing to do
with the biography.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.071
When our mother-that is,
Jules' mother, my mother-

35:16.197 --> 35:18.073
when our mother arrived here
as a refugee,

35:18.199 --> 35:21.284
she brought with her from
Germany some valuable things,

35:21.410 --> 35:22.911
her jewelry.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.080
Now, I have her jewelry.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.124
And I would like
to dispose of it,

35:27.250 --> 35:32.462
and I would like you to help me
dispose of it.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.755
- Is it legal?

35:33.881 --> 35:34.923
- Is what legal?

35:35.049 --> 35:37.592
- Taking these things
out of the country?

35:37.718 --> 35:39.469
- No, it's moral.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.804
They're my things.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.639
They were my mother's.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.267
When she arrived here,
she hid them away.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.768
Because of her experiences
in Germany,

35:46.894 --> 35:47.936
she trusted no one.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.896
She didn't feel safe anywhere.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.482
Outside of this cocoon
that they built here,

35:52.608 --> 35:56.153
why, she and my father
didn't feel safe on this planet.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.782
So after her death,
very shortly after my father's,

36:00.908 --> 36:02.117
I found the jewels.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.953
- Do Arden and Caroline know
about them?

36:05.079 --> 36:06.121
- Nope.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.039
They know nothing
of that history.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.624
Even Caroline
hardly knew my mother.

36:09.750 --> 36:14.129
She certainly knew nothing
of what was precious to her.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.964
So I took the jewels.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.009
I felt I could assume
that they were mine

36:19.135 --> 36:22.971
as Caroline, in due course,
felt free to take what was hers.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.556
- From what your mother left?

36:24.682 --> 36:28.476
- With Caroline,
it was what my brother left.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.728
Have you never thought,

36:29.854 --> 36:32.564
never suspected that
there might be another book?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.815
- Other than The Gondola?

36:33.941 --> 36:35.442
- Mm-hmm.

36:35.568 --> 36:39.571
- It is well known, Jules Gund
wrote only that one book.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.825
- Well, he was working
on another one when he died.

36:43.951 --> 36:47.078
It is my theory that he died,
or killed himself,

36:47.205 --> 36:50.332
because he couldn't...

36:50.458 --> 36:52.167
couldn't write anymore.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.752
Or because of what
he was writing

36:53.878 --> 36:56.755
or trying to write.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.465
A psychological impasse.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.634
- Caroline has the manuscript?

37:00.760 --> 37:03.261
- I don't know.
You have to ask her.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.679
But that is not the subject

37:04.805 --> 37:06.848
of our present little talk,
is it?

37:06.974 --> 37:08.099
My jewels.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.518
My need for money.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.895
Ah, here's Pete.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.532
Hail to thee!

38:04.198 --> 38:05.240
Come upstairs.
Follow me.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.533
I want to show you something.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.873
It is not for myself
that I need the money;

38:14.000 --> 38:15.041
it is for Pete,

38:15.167 --> 38:18.712
who may be free to leave me.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.297
- Does he want to leave you?

38:20.423 --> 38:21.589
- He should.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.385
He still has a chance at
a better life than with me here.

38:25.511 --> 38:27.554
You know, in order to bring him
here to Uruguay,

38:27.680 --> 38:30.223
I had to adopt him.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.559
Legally, he is my son.

38:38.482 --> 38:42.610
Come and sit down, please.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.739
- I'll do what you ask.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.949
- Even though it's illegal
and dangerous?

38:48.075 --> 38:50.910
- I think
it's the right thing to do.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.747
If you can trust me
not to screw it up.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.623
- Ah, we shall see.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.460
Please, sit down.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.627
So here's the treasure.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.755
Some of it is mixed up
with my father's.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.673
That's my father's watch.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.134
Mother used to keep them
locked in the safe,

39:06.260 --> 39:09.679
but sometimes she'd take it out
and wear it for me to show me.

39:09.805 --> 39:10.889
And, uh...

39:11.015 --> 39:14.267
I was her favorite, you know,
her firstborn,

39:14.393 --> 39:16.269
her Adam, she called me.

39:17.605 --> 39:20.190
Of course,
Jules could never get over that.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.150
She would show me
how she wore them

39:22.276 --> 39:25.362
and where.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.781
This at the opera.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.616
She had much smaller wrists
than mine.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.785
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

39:31.911 --> 39:32.994
Go on, you can take it.

39:33.120 --> 39:37.123
It's all right.

39:37.249 --> 39:43.004
And these at the Burgtheater.

39:43.130 --> 39:47.133
- Isn't that beautiful?

39:47.259 --> 39:50.845
Oh, yes, and this little horse
was for the races.

39:50.971 --> 39:54.641
And she'd wear this
attached to her cloche hat.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.428
- It's me, Omar Razaghi.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.934
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.519
- I'm just having my breakfast.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.814
Come in.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.529
- Oh.
No, thank you.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.206
- You don't have to say
anything nice about it.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.833
- No, I like it.
It's very interesting.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.418
- It's only a copy.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.587
That's all I do nowadays,
is copies,

41:05.713 --> 41:07.088
copy the masters.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.339
It's safer.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.593
That way,
I don't reveal anything.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.636
It's what art does,

41:13.762 --> 41:14.929
even biography.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.890
Especially biography.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.809
- I would be very discreet.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.437
I would absolutely
respect your wishes

41:22.563 --> 41:23.938
as to what to reveal.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.615
- What if I were to tell you
that Jules explicitly said

41:33.741 --> 41:37.285
he didn't want a biography
of himself?

41:37.411 --> 41:39.621
He wrote it to me in a letter.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.748
I suppose
you'd want to see that letter.

41:41.874 --> 41:42.916
- Well, yes.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.542
I'd like to very much.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.503
- And why
would I show it to you?

41:46.629 --> 41:49.005
I don't know anything about you,

41:49.131 --> 41:54.469
no more than you know about me
or ever will.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.598
What if I were to ask you,
have you ever been in love,

41:58.724 --> 42:02.560
passionately in love?

42:04.939 --> 42:06.648
See, you can't answer me.

42:06.774 --> 42:07.899
You're not sure.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.317
- I am sure.

42:09.443 --> 42:13.404
- Do you have a girlfriend?

42:13.531 --> 42:14.739
A partner?

42:14.865 --> 42:17.075
- Why do you want to know?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.577
- Are you romantically involved?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.538
- Yes.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.164
I suppose I am.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.499
- Suppose?

42:24.625 --> 42:27.001
That doesn't sound very
positive, let alone passionate.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.837
- We've been together two years.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.590
Her name is Deirdre.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.509
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

42:34.635 --> 42:38.429
I mean, here in Uruguay.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.015
I would have accepted
your decision.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.183
I would have given up.

42:42.309 --> 42:45.353
- I see.

42:45.479 --> 42:48.356
Sit.

42:48.482 --> 42:51.901
So it is your friend Deirdre

42:52.027 --> 42:54.153
who made you come
to change our minds.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.780
And what if
you can't change our minds?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.031
What will she think?

42:57.157 --> 42:59.200
She'll think you failed.

42:59.326 --> 43:00.368
- Yes.

43:00.494 --> 43:02.120
And she'd be right.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.663
I will have failed.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.540
- Sometimes it's good to fail,

43:05.666 --> 43:07.125
to try but to fail.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.793
There's nothing ignoble in that.

43:08.919 --> 43:09.961
- You don't understand.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.379
Everything depends on it:

43:11.505 --> 43:13.298
my job, my career,

43:13.424 --> 43:15.925
maybe my relationship
with my girlfriend.

43:18.929 --> 43:22.390
- You're so young.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.559
Are you sure that's
what you want your life to be

43:24.685 --> 43:27.478
forever and ever:

43:27.605 --> 43:30.523
that job, that career,

43:30.649 --> 43:32.942
that girlfriend?

43:36.530 --> 43:41.659
I'll show you
a real picture I painted.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.162
It's Jules, only it's not him,

43:44.288 --> 43:46.914
not as he really was,
which only I knew.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.917
You don't see it
because I couldn't paint it.

43:50.044 --> 43:54.922
I wasn't good enough
to paint it.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.884
I suppose now you'll write
how the widow of Jules Gund

43:58.010 --> 43:59.927
is sitting
in a south American jungle

44:00.054 --> 44:03.598
painting atrocious paintings
and slowly going mad

44:03.724 --> 44:05.058
or not so slowly.

44:05.184 --> 44:08.102
- I promise to write nothing
you don't want me to write.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.104
- Point is,
I want you to write nothing.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.856
- If you could just give me
one reason.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.107
- I don't have a reason.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.276
As anyone will tell you,
I am an unreasonable person.

44:15.402 --> 44:16.778
Jules himself
would have told you that

44:16.904 --> 44:17.945
if he'd still been here.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.114
In fact,
it's the very word he used

44:20.240 --> 44:22.784
when he felt I wasn't
being accommodating enough

44:22.910 --> 44:24.452
to his arrangements.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.454
"You're so unreasonable,
Caroline."

44:26.580 --> 44:27.622
- I'm sorry.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.040
I shouldn't have come here.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.958
- Don't apologize.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.211
No, it's good sometimes
to hear another voice.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.379
I was beginning to think

44:34.505 --> 44:36.005
that apart from
our little group here,

44:36.131 --> 44:37.924
there was no one else
left in the world.

44:42.429 --> 44:50.436
âª âª

45:12.126 --> 45:13.876
- Do you want to hear
how Arden met Jules?

45:14.002 --> 45:15.086
- Yes.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.380
- Omar doesn't want
to know that at all.

45:17.506 --> 45:21.134
- He's writing a book;
he has to know everything.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.470
- Mm-hmm.

45:24.596 --> 45:28.891
- Um...I was traveling
around Spain

45:29.017 --> 45:32.395
when I met some people
going to Uruguay.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.480
So I went with them,

45:34.606 --> 45:37.316
and they turned out
to be a missionary group

45:37.443 --> 45:41.404
sent to convert
the heathen of south America.

45:43.198 --> 45:44.949
- Don't laugh.

45:45.075 --> 45:48.578
Our name was joyful noise.

45:50.622 --> 45:54.667
And we went around in a bus
and gave concerts in the street.

45:54.793 --> 45:56.169
We never drew much of a crowd,

45:56.295 --> 45:59.839
but people listened
very politely.

45:59.965 --> 46:01.257
But by the time we'd finished,

46:01.383 --> 46:03.926
there was usually
only one or two left.

46:04.052 --> 46:07.054
But we went right on singing
and playing.

46:07.181 --> 46:11.601
- Arden shook the tambourine.

46:11.727 --> 46:16.606
- Anyway, one day,
Jules stopped to listen.

46:16.732 --> 46:21.235
And when we were through,
he came up to me and said,

46:21.361 --> 46:22.779
"What are you doing?

46:22.905 --> 46:25.281
And why are you doing it?"

46:25.407 --> 46:27.074
So I stopped.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.493
- And then I was born.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.912
- Well,
not quite so quickly, darling.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.080
- Nine months later, anyway.

47:18.001 --> 47:20.962
- I'm packing a picnic lunch.

47:21.088 --> 47:24.131
- Why are you going on a picnic?

47:24.258 --> 47:26.717
- I'm taking Omar
to show him the gondola.

47:26.844 --> 47:30.137
- Why?

47:30.264 --> 47:32.056
As if that gondola
isn't the most ludicrous

47:32.182 --> 47:34.642
of all the ludicrous
collected items here.

47:34.768 --> 47:35.810
- I don't feel that.

47:35.936 --> 47:39.313
- No...

47:39.439 --> 47:43.818
You've changed your mind
about the biography.

47:43.944 --> 47:46.320
Well, haven't you?

47:47.948 --> 47:50.324
Why shouldn't he
write the biography?

47:50.450 --> 47:51.659
He seems-

47:51.785 --> 47:54.996
he's just the right person
to understand Jules.

47:55.122 --> 47:56.664
- In what way
is he the right person?

47:56.790 --> 47:58.833
Because he's good-looking
and charming

47:58.959 --> 48:01.919
and because he's charmed you?

48:02.045 --> 48:05.590
What is it?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.133
I'm sorry.

48:07.259 --> 48:11.095
It's just that what we decided
before still stands for me.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.763
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.850
- Tell me what?

48:15.976 --> 48:17.810
- Do you know
he's in love with someone?

48:20.981 --> 48:23.357
- I didn't know that.

48:23.483 --> 48:24.942
- He told me he has a fiancÃ©e.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.110
Maybe they're not engaged,

48:26.236 --> 48:28.321
but he has
a romantic attachment.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.948
- Why are you telling me this?

48:31.074 --> 48:33.326
- Because I thought
you should know.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.536
- It has nothing to do
with anything.

48:35.662 --> 48:40.291
- I never said that it had,
but I wouldn't blame you.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.500
You're lonely.

48:41.627 --> 48:44.128
- I'm not lonely.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.297
Or maybe I am
and I didn't know it

48:46.423 --> 48:48.883
until there was a new person.

48:49.009 --> 48:54.055
When do we ever see anyone
or get to talk to anyone?

48:54.181 --> 48:55.806
And now-

48:55.933 --> 48:58.142
why are you talking to me
like this?

48:58.268 --> 48:59.852
Why do you want to hurt me?

48:59.978 --> 49:03.022
- I don't want to hurt you.

49:03.148 --> 49:05.691
I never wanted to hurt you.

49:05.817 --> 49:08.402
- Hola!

49:08.528 --> 49:10.738
- So you're off
to see the gondola.

49:10.864 --> 49:12.073
- Oh, yes.

49:12.199 --> 49:15.743
You'll be coming with us?

49:15.869 --> 49:18.663
- I've been there.

49:20.791 --> 49:21.916
- Mmm.

49:22.042 --> 49:24.168
- Maybe we shouldn't go.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.419
It's a long way.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.923
- Uh, well, if you're not
feeling up to it.

49:29.049 --> 49:31.759
- Well, if you're not allowed
to write the biography,

49:31.885 --> 49:33.552
there's no point in going.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.055
And Caroline
won't change her mind.

49:36.181 --> 49:38.265
That's the way she is.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.935
She has a much stronger
character than I have.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.103
- That's not true.

49:42.229 --> 49:43.437
- Oh, but it is.

49:43.563 --> 49:44.730
Jules used to say that

49:44.856 --> 49:48.234
any breeze could come
and blow me any which way.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.903
But actually,
why shouldn't we go?

49:51.029 --> 49:52.113
- Right.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.614
Why shouldn't we?

50:04.584 --> 50:06.544
- Whoa.

50:22.936 --> 50:24.270
Who won?

50:24.396 --> 50:25.938
- We did.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.612
- I have to go find Arden.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.448
- She is showing Omar
the gondola.

50:35.574 --> 50:36.615
- Without me?

50:36.742 --> 50:38.325
- They'll take you another time.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.286
- What if Omar goes away?

50:40.412 --> 50:41.662
Is he going away?

50:41.788 --> 50:45.166
- Do you want him to stay?

50:45.292 --> 50:47.043
- Definitely.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.841
- Do you live alone?

50:53.967 --> 50:55.509
- Yes.

50:55.635 --> 50:58.471
- But you have a girlfriend.

50:58.597 --> 51:02.141
- Yes.
I do.

51:02.267 --> 51:04.226
- What's her name?

51:04.352 --> 51:05.519
- Her name is Deirdre.

51:05.645 --> 51:10.024
She teaches
at the same university.

51:10.150 --> 51:11.650
- What does she teach?

51:11.777 --> 51:14.487
- Literature, like me.

51:14.613 --> 51:17.990
She's a good teacher.

51:18.116 --> 51:20.701
Much better than I'll ever be.

51:20.827 --> 51:24.163
The great Russians
and German poets.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.750
- Sorry, I'm being rude.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.668
I'm not used to meeting
new people,

51:29.795 --> 51:34.090
so I don't know
how to behave anymore.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.133
I shouldn't ask you
all those questions.

51:36.259 --> 51:39.220
- But think of all the questions
I want to ask you.

51:42.557 --> 51:45.184
Is all of this your land?

51:45.310 --> 51:48.938
- Pete keeps trying
to make us sell some of it,

51:49.064 --> 51:53.109
or at least lease it
for a vineyard or something.

51:53.235 --> 51:54.693
And we could do with the money,

51:54.820 --> 51:57.488
but you see how we all are.

52:05.205 --> 52:08.249
- There's no quicksand here,
is there?

52:08.375 --> 52:10.376
A swamp you could sink into?

52:10.502 --> 52:13.462
- Oh, well, yes,
there's lots of swamps.

52:13.588 --> 52:14.922
So watch out.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.931
What's wrong?

52:24.057 --> 52:26.976
- I...

52:27.102 --> 52:29.812
I feel a bit strange.

52:29.938 --> 52:31.438
Can't be the altitude.

52:31.565 --> 52:33.774
- Oh, no, we're at sea level.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.776
Maybe you're just hungry.

52:35.902 --> 52:36.944
Come on.

52:37.070 --> 52:39.738
- Maybe.

52:39.865 --> 52:41.615
- I want you to know,

52:41.741 --> 52:44.994
I've changed my mind
about the biography.

52:45.120 --> 52:49.540
Why should I be afraid
of stirring up bad memories?

52:49.666 --> 52:50.708
There aren't any.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.668
There's Portia

52:52.794 --> 52:56.630
and this lovely place
for her to grow up in.

52:56.756 --> 52:58.966
I want you to write the book.

52:59.092 --> 53:01.385
Like Adam, I'm on your side.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.387
I give you my-what is it?

53:03.513 --> 53:05.764
My-my authorization.

53:12.314 --> 53:16.233
You know, I came here
to write one kind of book.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.776
- No, thanks.

53:21.448 --> 53:25.993
- And now it's turning
into something different.

53:26.119 --> 53:30.831
Like, it's no longer
about Jules

53:30.957 --> 53:34.001
but about you-all of you.

53:34.127 --> 53:36.670
And your life here

53:36.796 --> 53:39.840
and even about me here with you.

53:39.966 --> 53:42.176
Does that make sense?

53:42.302 --> 53:44.553
No? It doesn't?

53:44.679 --> 53:48.265
- Well, not entirely,
but you said you were feeling...

53:53.980 --> 53:55.147
- Oh.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.671
May I get in?
- Yeah.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.969
It needs painting.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.387
I keep wanting to do it.

54:26.513 --> 54:27.554
- I'll help you.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.556
I'd like to do that.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.643
- Caroline hates the gondola
more than anything.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.603
I don't know why.

54:56.293 --> 55:00.921
- What's she like,
Deirdre?

55:01.047 --> 55:05.759
- She's very determined.

55:05.885 --> 55:08.262
Very strong personality.

55:08.388 --> 55:12.224
She decides what needs
to be done and does it.

55:12.350 --> 55:13.767
- That's how I'd want to be.

55:13.893 --> 55:15.519
- Well, so would I.

55:15.645 --> 55:17.062
I don't suppose
I'll ever manage it.

55:18.356 --> 55:19.565
- Me neither.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.255
Can you help me get out?
- Oh, sure.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.578
More, more.

56:19.501 --> 56:21.210
- Portia.

56:21.336 --> 56:24.505
Pete, I wish
you wouldn't let her do this.

56:24.631 --> 56:25.714
You're not even protected.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.926
- You want to help?
- No.

56:31.721 --> 56:33.472
- Gracias.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.057
- Can't I do it?
- No.

56:35.183 --> 56:36.934
Certainly not.
You're not to climb up there.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.143
- I'll do it.
- Not at all.

56:38.269 --> 56:39.645
- Can I help?
- Sure.

56:39.771 --> 56:42.940
Take the net
up the other ladder.

56:43.066 --> 56:44.942
- I'll take that.

56:55.787 --> 57:00.040
Portia, stay away
from the bees.

57:00.166 --> 57:02.167
- Pull the net towards you.

57:02.293 --> 57:06.713
- Let me get higher.
- Okay.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.382
A little more.
- Okay.

57:11.886 --> 57:13.971
Ow!

57:14.097 --> 57:15.139
- Careful.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.475
Omar.

57:18.601 --> 57:19.643
- Ow!

57:21.438 --> 57:22.563
- Omar!
- Omar!

57:22.689 --> 57:23.772
thud!

57:27.026 --> 57:28.152
- No!

57:29.612 --> 57:31.113
- Omar?

57:31.239 --> 57:32.865
Omar.

59:38.324 --> 59:40.701
Oh, Omar.

59:40.827 --> 59:43.453
Omar, the doctor's
made a mistake.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.081
He thinks I'm your girlfriend.

59:49.168 --> 59:53.964
Can you hear me?

59:54.090 --> 59:58.635
Can you feel me?

59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.137
But it's all right.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:03.473
I found Deirdre's phone number
in your book.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.852
I left a message on her machine.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:11.565
Maybe she'll come soon,
and then everything-

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.983
can you hear me?

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.736
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:19.489
Deirdre's coming.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.950
Oh, please blink.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.187
- No way.

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:30.811
- Let me just show you
your bedroom and bathroom.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.939
Did you know Omar was allergic
to bee sting?

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.148
- I did not.

01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:38.985
But I'm not surprised.

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:50.997
- Are those gauchos?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.165
- No.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.459
Oh, yes.
Gauchos.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:58.338
Cowboys.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:00.340
There's something
I must tell you.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:01.842
No, thanks.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:04.177
The doctor, Dr. Pereira,

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:08.724
he's taken very good care
of Omar, but, um...

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.977
he's made a silly mistake.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:16.273
He thinks I'm Omar's lover.

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:18.650
- Oh.

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:20.527
- It's the sort of thing
he would think.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:21.987
He's Latin American.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.322
They see the world
in a certain way.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.534
But I didn't correct him.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.327
- Why not?

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:34.332
- As I said, Dr. Pereira
is the way men are here.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:37.586
They like to think
of men and women involved,

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.963
romantically involved.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.215
I thought that
if the doctor thinks that,

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:46.428
that Omar is loved-
that I love him-

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:50.140
then he would
take very special care of him.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.308
- Moo!

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.018
- But of course,
now that you're here...

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.437
- No, that's all right.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:57.105
Whatever works best for Omar,

01:02:57.231 --> 01:03:00.192
I don't care
what a doctor thinks.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:02.360
Let him think I'm Omar's sister.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.488
- Oh, you don't look
like his sister,

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:08.200
nothing like.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:28.470
- He's in this ward,

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.638
on the right.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:30.806
I'll wait outside.

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.265
- Okay, thank you.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:07.717
- Mm.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.137
My god.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.807
Why are you here?

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:16.726
- Arden called me.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.311
You were in a coma.

01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:25.735
Has Arden been visiting you?

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.988
- Have you met her?

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.739
- Of course,
I'm staying in the house.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.242
- Don't you like it?

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.785
Isnât it amazing,

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:36.997
the house and everything?

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:41.251
- Do you remember what happened?

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.421
With the bees?

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.673
- No.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:50.468
I don't remember anything
that happened that day clearly.

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.185
- Are you a friend
of our poor Omar?

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.438
- Yes, I'm very worried
about Omar.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.689
- You must not worry.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.357
You are too beautiful to worry.

01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:08.028
All the women who visit Omar
are beautiful.

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:11.114
His recovery
has nothing to do with me.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.034
It is the beauty of women
that cured him.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.641
- Where did you
get these pajamas?

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:38.892
- I don't know.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:42.228
I woke up wearing them.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.981
- Did Arden bring them?

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.900
They may have belonged to Jules.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:49.819
You are wearing
Jules Gund's pajamas.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:53.239
- Mmm.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.992
- Do you think she's changed
her mind about authorization?

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.495
- Well, I'm not very sure
about Caroline.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.871
- We'll see about her.

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:01.331
What about Arden?

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:04.209
- She's leaning my way.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:07.253
Our way.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.381
- And the other one,
the brother?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.716
- Adam?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:11.842 --> 01:06:13.426
- He's always been on my side.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.428
And he says
he'll help me with Caroline,

01:06:15.554 --> 01:06:16.763
and I said I'd help him.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.098
- Help him with what?

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.766
What can you help him with?

01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:21.434
- It's nothing, really.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.478
He just wants me
to carry something for him

01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:25.397
when I go back to the States.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:26.940
- Carry what?

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:30.568
- Just some things.

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:32.445
- What things?

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:33.613
- Some...

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:35.573
pieces of jewelry.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.867
Stuff like that.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.035
- Jewelry?

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:42.789
Did you say you would?

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:45.792
Omar, you're crazy.

01:06:45.918 --> 01:06:47.085
It's smuggling.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.712
He's asking you
to smuggle for him.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.922
You'll go to jail.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.008
- He wouldn't ask me
to do anything criminal.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.175
He's not that type.

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:56.261
- Anyone who asks you
to take something

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.138
secretly out of the country
for him

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.973
is that type.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.684
- He's been very helpful to me
with the biography.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.935
And that's what I'm here for:

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:05.937
to get authorization
for the biography.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:07.647
- This is not the way to get it.

01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:09.733
- I'm doing it my way.
Everything's fine.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.484
- Everything is not fine, Omar.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.486
If it were, I wouldn't be here.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:14.779
- I didn't ask you to come here.

01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:16.156
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.992
I flew 5,000 miles
because you were in a coma.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.160
A coma!

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:21.369
- Stop.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.955
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

01:07:24.081 --> 01:07:27.292
I just-I wish you wouldn't
treat me like a baby.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.960
- Then don't act like a baby.

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:30.962
Don't agree to smuggle jewelry.

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.422
Don't fall out of a tree.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.841
- Falling out of a tree
was an accident.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.551
- You know what I think
about accidents.

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:38.970
- Accidents happen to people,
Deirdre.

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:42.891
We can't all be perfect
like you.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:45.810
- I'm not perfect.

01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:48.730
I know I'm not perfect.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.023
I don't think I am.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.317
I'm just trying
to help you, Omar,

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:56.488
because I love you.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:58.448
You really wish I hadn't come?

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:01.451
- No.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.744
- Because I can leave.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.037
I can leave whenever you want.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.705
- No.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.040
Want you to stay.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:17.884
- Omar,
you've broken your wrist.

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.345
Let me wipe the soup
off your face.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:38.238
- Adam!

01:08:42.408 --> 01:08:45.245
- So how is
our poor young friend?

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.455
I hear he's recovering.

01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:50.082
- His girlfriend has arrived

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.792
to comfort him,

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:55.004
and hopefully
to take him home.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.090
Where's Pete?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.591
- Taking a shower.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.685
So...

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.856
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.566
It really is a pleasure,
you know?

01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:28.037
Well, here we are.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.457
To the pleasure of you.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:36.296
- How sweet you are.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.796
- Not bad.

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:38.965
Not bad at all.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.800
Please, sit down.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.926
- It's supposed to be
a cocktail.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.140
- Cocktail.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:50.643
What a lovely word.

01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:52.353
If only one could drink it

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.314
where a cocktail
should be drunk,

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.399
sitting on a barstool

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:59.777
somewhere dark, secluded.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:00.945
But liquor is liquor

01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:02.614
wherever you go in the world,
isn't it?

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.491
- It's a Manhattan,

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.411
or half a Manhattan,
since you have no bourbon.

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:09.829
- A Manhattan.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:11.998
That's your Moscow.

01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:13.166
Hmm?

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.168
"Oh, Olga, Olga,
let us go to Moscow.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.503
There's no place in the world
like Moscow."

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.925
- Adam, I want to ask you,

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.676
do you think
I was wrong to stay here?

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:26.095
- What do you mean?

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.598
- You know what I mean.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:32.185
When Jules came back
with Arden.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.770
- I didn't judge you.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.481
It was your affair and Jules'.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.191
- She was so pathetic.

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:39.859
It was as if he'd picked up
a stray kitten

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:42.779
and brought it home,

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.489
a pregnant kitten.

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.699
- Yeah.

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:49.118
- Now I think she's changed
her mind about the biography,

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.536
as you have.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:51.746
- I never opposed it.

01:10:51.872 --> 01:10:52.914
Why should we?

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.874
A biography is nothing,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.876
an account of the facts
written by,

01:10:57.002 --> 01:11:00.046
well, just for all we know,
some academic hack.

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.714
Though I hope not.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.800
Maybe he'll surprise us.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.218
Poor boy.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:06.803
What a thing to happen.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.471
A bee, can you imagine?

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.139
- It's his own fault.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.307
Why did he come here?

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.977
He has no business here,
hack or not.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:17.146
- Supposing Jules
had written something himself.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.649
Had he?

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.109
Yes, he had.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.402
I thought so.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.321
And it would have to be
personal, autobiographical,

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.824
'cause Jules
was not an inventive writer.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.159
And as The Gondola
was about our parents' lives,

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.828
this other manuscript-

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.663
- Which no longer exists.

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.498
- Which no longer exists...

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:39.669
would be about his life with you
and Arden in this place.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.422
And for all I know,

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:45.842
even about Pete and me.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:50.179
- How could any outsider
understand this place

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:54.058
or what it was like
to all live here together

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:57.603
or what it's like now
without him?

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.272
- Yes.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.109
You know,
you could leave tomorrow

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:04.652
if you wanted to,

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:06.779
any time you choose.

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:09.907
- You very well know,
I have no money.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.076
How could I get
the fare together?

01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:13.745
Don't you think I haven't
thought of it,

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.122
that I don't sit up there
pretending to paint,

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:19.459
brooding over
where I might be instead?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.626
I need a real drink.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.629
How about you?

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.298
Scotch.
- Yeah.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.800
- Not getting very far
on just vermouth.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.098
Adam, do you like life?

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.977
Well, I wouldn't like
to live forever.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:42.106
But um, for a little while,
yes, but...

01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:44.275
yes, I like it.

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:45.818
- But living here?

01:12:45.944 --> 01:12:47.487
You wouldn't rather
be somewhere else,

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:48.654
New York, London?

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.823
- No.
- Why not?

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:52.617
- Because you have
to care about-

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:55.661
or at least pretend to care
about everything:

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:58.122
politics, fashion, culture.

01:12:58.248 --> 01:12:59.499
It's just exhausting.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.210
- What I wouldn't give
to see some new painters,

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:05.963
a new play, go to the opera.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.508
Yes, I know.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.344
To Moscow, Olga.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.972
- Yeah.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.682
This is a very potent drink.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:20.103
Perhaps I should not
have indulged in a refill.

01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:26.526
Tell me something.
Was there ever a letter?

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.735
Did Jules really write to you

01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:29.445
saying he didn't want
a biography?

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.613
- No.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.073
But I know
he wouldn't have wanted it.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.282
- How would you know that?

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.992
- Because he destroyed
the manuscript.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.162
- He destroyed it himself?

01:13:38.288 --> 01:13:39.497
- He wanted no one to know

01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:42.333
what only concerned himself
and me.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:44.168
So no matter
what you and Arden decide,

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:47.213
I shall never allow
this biography to be written,

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:49.632
even if he gets stung
by 100 bees.

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:02.603
- Excuse me.

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:05.064
Can you tell me the way
to the mill house, please?

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:07.567
- You have to go back this way

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:11.612
and then
through the bamboo grove.

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:12.905
- Through there.

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:14.073
- Thank you.

01:14:18.912 --> 01:14:20.538
- What do you think of her?

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:22.457
- What do you?

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:25.585
- I don't see her with Omar,

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.044
her personality.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:30.173
But I don't know either of them
very well.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.467
What do you think?

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.479
Will you miss them
when they're gone?

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.564
- No.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.649
- I mean Omar.

01:14:48.775 --> 01:14:49.984
Will you miss Omar?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.992
Do you love him?

01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:01.496
- No.

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:07.293
No, I don't love Omar.

01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:10.046
What?
Why did you ask me that?

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:13.216
Omar didn't say anything to you
about me

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.301
when you went to see him
in the hospital?

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:17.094
- No,
I just thought,

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.971
if I were you...

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:22.725
- If you were me, what?

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.810
- I might love him.

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:28.564
Well, it's as you said, Pete.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.899
We hardly know him.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.568
He's only been here
for a short time,

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.153
he has a girlfriend,

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:35.988
and he's leaving soon.

01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:38.908
The doctor says he can travel
in a few days.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.993
They're both leaving.

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:42.161
I'm glad.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:04.433
- Mr. Gund?

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.644
- Who calls?

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.853
- Hello.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.355
- Hello.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:11.691
- I could come back another time
if you're not free.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.109
- Not free?

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.860
As you can see, I'm quite free,

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.529
hopelessly free,

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.948
for the rest of my life.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:22.326
This is Jesus,
and you must be, uh...Deborah.

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:23.494
- Deirdre.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.037
- Deirdre.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:27.373
May I offer you something?

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:29.667
- Oh, just some mineral water
if you have it.

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:31.627
- Mineral water, hmm.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:32.962
How about a dry martini?

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.298
No.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.465
No, thank you.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:39.385
- So you must be,
um...Omar's paramour.

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.137
It's so difficult
finding the right word

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.305
to describe a relationship.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.640
At least my relationships.

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.393
They're all too complicated
for mere words.

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.228
- Paramour
is not the right word.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:53.149
I wouldn't use it to describe
Omar's and my relationship.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.860
- Do sit down, my dear.
You look as if you might bolt.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:58.821
I've offended you, no doubt.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.157
Good.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.325
You know, in my youth,

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.577
I used to call my partners
my paramours.

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.371
It's such a lovely word
to describe a lovely situation.

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:11.083
And as a result, I remained
a youth for a very long time.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:13.586
The aging process was retarded,
but alas,

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:16.255
one morning I woke up and-

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:18.924
I was an old man
who talks too much.

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.760
But it is you who've come
to talk to me, yes,

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.889
I have no doubt,
about the authorization.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:28.100
As you've probably heard,
I'm on Omar's side.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:30.436
We have made our arrangement.

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:32.229
- That is what I've come
to talk to you about,

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.231
what you call an arrangement.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.399
- So he has told you about it?

01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:40.112
- He has,
and I consider it blackmail.

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:42.615
You said you had made a bargain
with Omar.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.909
You asked him to smuggle
certain items out of the country

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.119
in return for your help
in getting him authorization.

01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:48.537
I...

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:49.914
call that blackmail.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.749
- "Smuggle," "blackmail."

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:54.960
My, my, you do have
a romantic imagination.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.587
- I will not allow him to do it.

01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:58.381
And besides,
he's the wrong person for it.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.548
- I agree with you.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.217
Omar is certainly not
the right person.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:04.178
Unlike you, he is not practical.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:10.101
But you will be returning
to the United States as well?

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:12.186
- Are you trying to make
a little bargain with me now?

01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:13.354
- Please, do sit down.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.939
I'm enjoying your company.
Sit down.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.482
You're so invigorating.

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:18.401
It's a pity
you have no sense of adventure.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.277
- I certainly have a sense
of what's legal

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.779
and what is not.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:24.532
- You know,

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:26.283
one day, you will regret this.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:29.620
You will regret having come
all the way to south America

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:33.791
and not involving yourself
in what you encounter here.

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.668
You will think, "Oh, why?

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:39.130
Oh, why
did I not smuggle those things?"

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:41.257
- So it is smuggling.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.803
- Well, you read too many books.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:47.847
Or perhaps you don't even
read books anymore.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.975
You probably just read
criticism of books.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.476
- Mr. Gund,

01:18:52.602 --> 01:18:54.979
you must consider your little
bargain with Omar dissolved.

01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:56.147
Neither he nor I

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.023
will be able to help you
in this business.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.233
We'll have to get Caroline

01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:01.235
somehow to agree
to authorization without you.

01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:04.029
- Mm-hmm.
How will you do that?

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.740
- We can try,

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.575
honestly try,

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.453
without resorting to bargains
and blackmail.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.747
- Hmm.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.417
It seems a bit stupid to me,
if I may be so blunt,

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:19.086
to alienate me like this.

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.714
After all, what is stopping me
changing my mind?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.048
- Oh.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.050
Excuse me, I...

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.344
I understood
you wanted a biography.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:32.933
I didn't think your support
was variable or could be bought.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:36.353
Gracias, Jesus.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.774
Gracias.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.402
Well, I admire your gumption.

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:45.738
But I think it best

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:49.617
that this situation be resolved
between Omar and myself.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:51.410
The arrangement was made
with Omar,

01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:54.121
so it is up to Omar
to dissolve it.

01:19:54.247 --> 01:19:56.457
I have enjoyed our little chat.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:01.170
Please excuse me.

01:20:14.392 --> 01:20:22.399
âª âª

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:37.498
- Mrs. Gund.

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:43.295
âª âª

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:46.841
These are lovely.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.552
- Are you fond of art?

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:50.761
- It's not my field,

01:20:50.887 --> 01:20:55.224
but some paintings
I like very much.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.392
I have been hoping to talk-

01:20:56.518 --> 01:21:01.146
- What kind of paintings
do you like very much?

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.148
- The impressionists,

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:06.861
Cezanne and Monet, van Gogh.

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:08.654
Perhaps they weren't
all impressionists,

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.075
or were they?

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.828
- As far you need be concerned,
they were.

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:18.330
âª âª

01:21:18.456 --> 01:21:19.790
- May I speak to you?

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:21.333
- Of course you may.

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:23.836
Sit.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:25.462
Sit.

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:29.300
- May I?

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:33.262
- Of course.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.513
Little to the left, please.

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:45.649
âª âª

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:47.776
- I'd like to assure you

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:49.945
that Omar intends
to work very closely

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.615
with you all on the biography.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.366
If you knew what this is

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:55.701
for Omar,

01:21:55.827 --> 01:21:57.620
how very much depends on it
for him

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.788
to get authorization
and write this book.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:03.792
- I am not concerned
with Omar's needs.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.294
I have other...

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.301
different allegiances.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.552
- To Jules Gund?

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:15.638
- I don't think this is really
any of your business.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.972
But yes, to my husband.

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:20.976
âª âª

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:25.648
And to myself, for that matter.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.067
- Why are you
withholding authorization?

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.778
Perhaps if you told me,
I could address your concerns.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:31.987
- Shh.

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.826
âª âª

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:40.663
Do you recognize it?

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.665
- It sounds familiar.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:46.418
- It's Poulenc,

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:51.382
Tres Lent et Calme.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:56.679
- I hope
you will consider reconsidering.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:00.516
- I have already discussed this
with Omar.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.643
I have told him more than once

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:04.603
that I will not
change my decision.

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:07.106
- But Arden has changed hers.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:10.442
- Miss Langdon has her reasons;
I have mine.

01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:15.447
âª âª

01:23:15.573 --> 01:23:17.116
lsn't it marvelous?

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:21.453
âª âª

01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:23.956
- I think I'm wasting your time.

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:27.126
- Time is not a very precious
commodity around here.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:29.628
- But you've made up your mind.

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:32.131
- I made it up long ago,

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.383
long before Omar arrived.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:38.137
- Then there's really no point
in me or Omar talking to you.

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:39.596
- Not about that subject,

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:43.809
but we could talk
about something else.

01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:45.811
Art?

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:49.106
But that's not your field.

01:23:49.232 --> 01:23:51.483
Music?

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:54.153
Or is music
not your field either?

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.824
But surely you like this.

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.075
How could you not?

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:05.330
âª âª

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.249
- No, thank you.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.838
âª âª

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:18.135
âª âª

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.568
- But why do you need Omar?

01:24:34.694 --> 01:24:36.487
- I didn't want you to know.

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:38.572
It was to be a secret.

01:24:38.698 --> 01:24:39.823
It was for you, you idiot.

01:24:39.949 --> 01:24:41.658
I wanted you to have the money.

01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:42.826
- Why?

01:24:42.952 --> 01:24:44.328
For what?

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:46.205
- I have a good business
of my own.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.540
I don't need more money.
You do.

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:49.708
I'm happy.

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:51.210
- What, here with me?

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.629
I don't think you know much
about happiness, my friend.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:54.922
- Do you?

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:57.508
- Oh, I gave up on all that
stuff a long time ago.

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.510
- You pretend you have.

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:02.096
Don't I make you happy,
at least sometimes?

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:03.764
- Yes, of course.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:08.060
- So why are you trying
to send me away?

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:10.437
- Because I don't want you
wasting yourself on me.

01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:13.107
I'm an old man,

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:16.193
"a paltry thing,
a tattered coat upon a stick."

01:25:16.319 --> 01:25:18.112
Make a life for yourself,

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:20.781
for god's sake.

01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:22.741
- Look at me.

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:24.243
Go on, look.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:25.702
- I'm looking.

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:29.581
I'm 40 years old.

01:25:29.707 --> 01:25:32.584
I've lived with you
for 25 years.

01:25:34.754 --> 01:25:38.799
I don't want any other life.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.760
- 25 years.

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:43.762
Hmm.

01:25:43.888 --> 01:25:45.889
You're a sweet boy.

01:25:46.015 --> 01:25:48.267
And I've always loved you,
and I love you now.

01:26:00.613 --> 01:26:04.241
- But there is someone
who needs money to leave.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.036
- Oh, Caroline, yes.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.459
- Don't involve Omar in this.

01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:15.794
- Hmm?

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.505
- I can get much better price
than he ever could.

01:26:18.631 --> 01:26:21.466
If not in Montevideo,
then in Buenos Aires.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:22.634
- You can?

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.802
How?

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:25.470
- I have contacts.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:29.308
- So how much do you think
you will make with these?

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:32.311
- Enough for
where she wants to be.

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:34.771
- Really?

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:38.567
Supposing we exact
a small exchange with Caroline.

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:41.904
Supposing the money
you make for her,

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.323
she takes the cash and leaves.

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:45.908
- Quite a bit of cash.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.075
- Yes.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.994
And in return
for that bit of cash,

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.746
we could make a bargain
with her.

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.748
I suggest
she might want to make over

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:57.669
her part of Ocho Rios
to you.

01:26:57.795 --> 01:27:00.255
You'd be 1/3 partner
with Portia and myself,

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:01.423
and of course, as you know,

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:03.592
we're more accommodating
than Caroline

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.762
and more used to signing things.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.430
So perhaps you could,
if you want to,

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:12.017
start one of
your moneymaking schemes.

01:27:12.143 --> 01:27:15.771
Thousands of acres of soybeans

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.982
blowing in the wind.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:20.317
- My god.

01:27:20.443 --> 01:27:23.820
How I'd make this place
work for us.

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:26.073
Oh.

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:42.839
- I'm going to Las Golondrinas
for a few days.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:44.967
I just wanted you to know.
- Why?

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.677
- I don't feel comfortable here.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:48.136
I want all these people
to go away.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.722
But as they only incapacitate
themselves and multiply,

01:27:50.848 --> 01:27:52.224
I'm going away myself.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.892
Call me when the coast is clear.

01:27:54.018 --> 01:27:55.727
- I'll do no such thing.

01:27:55.853 --> 01:27:57.604
Go if you want,
but don't give me orders.

01:27:57.730 --> 01:27:59.064
- Goodness.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:01.525
Sounds as if you're the one
who needs to get away from here.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.119
- Caroline.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:13.912
- I wonder
if Luis can get me there.

01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:17.249
Â¿Esta bien, Luis?
- A su disposicion, seÃ±ora.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:19.876
- Are you leaving
without talking to him,

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:21.044
to Omar?

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:22.212
Omar.

01:28:22.338 --> 01:28:23.380
- Why should I talk to him?

01:28:23.506 --> 01:28:24.548
I've talked a lot to him

01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:28.552
and to his
rather unpleasant girlfriend.

01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:31.096
- You're afraid that if you
stay, you'll change your mind.

01:28:31.222 --> 01:28:33.640
- I'm afraid if I stay,
I'll lose my mind.

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:42.399
- "My dear Caroline,

01:28:42.525 --> 01:28:44.568
"I have a confession to make.

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:47.779
"I am a jewel thief.

01:28:47.905 --> 01:28:51.575
"I have secretly kept
all my mother's diamonds.

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:54.786
"Graciously,
I beg you to absolve me

01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:58.623
"by accepting them
from my guilty hands.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.585
Don't overdo it."

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:02.753
- "Forgive me, if you can,

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:04.338
"and live happily
on the proceeds

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:06.923
"wherever you may choose.

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.301
"Pete and I have each other

01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:12.346
"and need almost nothing more.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:16.266
"But there is one fairly small
favor you can do for us.

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:18.852
"In return
for Mother's diamonds,

01:29:18.978 --> 01:29:22.939
"would you relinquish
your 1/3 share of Ocho Rios?

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.983
"Pete has great plans
for the estate

01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:27.944
"that I cannot even pretend
to understand.

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:30.405
"A new chapter
will soon begin for you

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:31.656
"and if, perchance,

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:33.617
"something is weighing
on your conscience-

01:29:33.743 --> 01:29:35.786
"and who among us
is without blame?

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:37.704
"Humanum errare est-

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:40.749
"rid yourself of it
with one small gesture.

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:44.211
"Allow the boy
to write the biography

01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:47.964
"yours is still
the one voice he needs.

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:49.424
Adam."

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.653
- Where is everyone?

01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:12.155
- They're busy
doing whatever they do,

01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:14.157
forging paintings,

01:30:14.283 --> 01:30:16.159
raising killer bees, I guess,

01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:17.953
and smuggling jewels.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.542
- Well,
can you please go find them

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:25.460
and tell them we're back
from the hospital?

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:32.175
- Find whom?

01:30:32.301 --> 01:30:35.846
- Arden...and everyone.

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:37.264
Caroline.

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:38.890
- Caroline.

01:30:39.016 --> 01:30:41.309
You certainly
need to speak to Caroline.

01:30:57.326 --> 01:30:58.827
- What are you drawing?

01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:16.261
- Are you finished?

01:31:16.387 --> 01:31:17.429
I'm sorry, Portia,

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:19.598
but I need to talk to Omar.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:26.438
Run along.

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.149
Can you believe it?

01:31:29.275 --> 01:31:30.775
Caroline has left.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:34.446
And without a word to us
about the authorization.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.323
I'll have to go after her
and speak to her.

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:39.951
I think she's enjoying this.

01:31:40.077 --> 01:31:42.204
These people are awful.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:47.626
- If anyone speaks to Caroline,
it'll have to be me.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:51.505
- I think I might be better
at handling a person like that.

01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:53.298
- I don't want to handle anyone.

01:31:53.424 --> 01:31:56.843
I hate that attitude.

01:31:56.969 --> 01:31:59.346
- Omar,

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:01.097
what's the matter with you?

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.564
I'm sorry.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.942
I'm sorry, you've been ill.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:15.779
You've only just
come out of the hospital.

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.864
You're not yourself.

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:19.658
And really,
you're not in a fit state

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:21.451
to go running
after crazy Caroline.

01:32:21.577 --> 01:32:23.662
- Please, Deirdre,

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.080
leave it to me.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.248
- Darling-

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.624
- Would you just let me rest?

01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:16.881
- Omar, "Las Golondrinas"

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:20.468
means little birds
that fly and sing.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:24.973
That is what we do here,
as you can see.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:28.059
Jules was always welcome here.

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:30.812
He lived with his two women
at Ocho Rios,

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:35.317
and sometimes
he had to come up for air...

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:38.153
when Caroline
was too much for him.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.988
- And Arden was too little.

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.243
- Don't you want to swim?

01:33:45.369 --> 01:33:46.911
We have plenty of suits.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:48.246
Yes?

01:33:48.372 --> 01:33:50.832
You don't have to put that arm
in the water, no?

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.500
El bracito en el agua,
Â¿para que?

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:53.668
No.

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:57.130
Traele...traele, Wilson...

01:33:57.256 --> 01:33:58.590
- No, no, no.
- Â¿Como no, no, no, no?

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:01.259
Si.
Plunk! Plunk! Plunk!

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:09.893
Jules was very, very attractive.

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.770
And depressive, of course.

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.439
But that made him
even more attractive,

01:34:14.565 --> 01:34:17.609
like Hamlet
or someone out of Dostoyevsky.

01:34:19.236 --> 01:34:22.781
He had the knack
of making each woman he met

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:27.077
feel she was the only one
who truly understood him.

01:34:27.203 --> 01:34:28.370
Only women.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:29.788
He didn't care for men,

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.207
nor they for him.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.126
And he was writing this book,

01:34:35.252 --> 01:34:38.338
another book
to make him even more famous.

01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:39.756
We thought it was thrilling.

01:34:39.882 --> 01:34:42.008
Perhaps we were all in it.

01:34:42.134 --> 01:34:45.804
And each one of us
thought she was his muse.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.765
And would go down in history,
no?

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:58.817
- God knows
what she's telling him.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:00.360
Every woman who ever met Jules

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:04.114
is convinced she understood him
better than I did,

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.491
or Arden, for that matter.

01:35:06.617 --> 01:35:09.869
- You know what I think?

01:35:09.995 --> 01:35:13.206
That he wasn't writing a book
at all.

01:35:13.332 --> 01:35:15.208
He was talking about it

01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:17.544
to impress us,

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:20.547
but he found he couldn't.

01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:24.968
And that made him-

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.469
he couldn't bear the thought

01:35:26.595 --> 01:35:29.889
of not being
a celebrated author anymore.

01:35:30.015 --> 01:35:34.144
Admired and famous and...

01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:37.272
and everyone
hopelessly in love with him.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:41.776
Ah, Wilson.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:42.944
- SeÃ±ora.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.112
- Gracias.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:50.869
Permiso.

01:35:52.621 --> 01:35:54.038
- Tango.

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:55.582
Tango.
Puedes.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.542
- Puedo.
- Puedes.

01:35:57.668 --> 01:35:59.669
- Puedes.
- Puedo, puedo.

01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:09.846
- Maybe we'll meet
in the States.

01:36:09.972 --> 01:36:11.264
I'd like that very much,

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:15.185
although maybe you prefer
to forget all about me.

01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:17.437
- I want to give you
a farewell present.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:20.106
About the biography,
go ahead and write it.

01:36:20.232 --> 01:36:23.443
Explain us to ourselves,
if you can.

01:36:23.569 --> 01:36:24.944
I'll be interested

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:28.573
to read your interpretation
or invention.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:34.788
I grant you my authorization.

01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:36.247
lsn't that what you wanted?

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:38.666
What you came here for?

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:40.752
- Of course.

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:42.754
And I'm very grateful to you.

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:48.968
- Deirdre anyway,
will be pleased.

01:36:49.094 --> 01:36:51.805
- But what about Jules' letter
that he didn't want a biography?

01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:53.264
- Jules never wrote
such a letter.

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.475
I made that up.

01:36:55.601 --> 01:36:58.812
But he did try
and write a second book.

01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:01.105
There is a manuscript.
It does exist.

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:04.859
No one's ever read it except me.

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.027
Jules never finished it.

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:08.488
He couldn't.

01:37:08.614 --> 01:37:11.449
Shall I tell you
about the last scene?

01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:14.786
The last he wrote
and then he couldn't go on?

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:18.289
In this last scene, Arden and I
are in the gondola,

01:37:18.415 --> 01:37:21.209
and we loathe each other
as we never did.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.753
Though, perhaps
that's what he was waiting for.

01:37:23.879 --> 01:37:25.296
But in the gondola,

01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:27.465
we have a terrible fight,

01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:28.883
a physical fight.

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:31.553
And I push Arden overboard.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.804
But you know what?

01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:34.806
The water isn't deep enough.

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:38.560
So I keep on pushing her down
and down.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:41.145
- Did you intend to publish it?

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:43.064
- There were times
when I felt that I had to,

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.483
that it was a responsibility,
a duty,

01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:48.736
to literature, if that
doesn't sound too grandiose.

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:52.490
- I don't believe
any of us has such a duty.

01:37:52.616 --> 01:37:55.326
I believe literature
takes its life from us,

01:37:55.452 --> 01:37:56.995
not the other way around.

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:59.998
- Is this the belief
of a professor of literature?

01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:04.752
- Oh, I'm afraid
this is the other Omar,

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.505
the misguided caliph
who burned all the books.

01:38:07.631 --> 01:38:10.091
You know,
the entire library of Alexandria

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.176
was fed into
the bathhouse boilers,

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:15.138
700,000 papyrus scrolls.

01:38:15.264 --> 01:38:17.765
It took six months
to burn them all up.

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:32.405
âª âª

01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:40.121
- Let me take that.

01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:47.587
Gracias.

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:06.981
- I was just coming down
to say good-bye.

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:08.524
- I've come up.

01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:20.578
- You must be very happy
with your success.

01:39:20.704 --> 01:39:21.829
- My success?

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.248
- You've achieved everything
you came for.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:27.251
With all three of us,
that's 100% success.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:28.586
- Arden,

01:39:28.712 --> 01:39:30.338
I'll come back soon.

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:32.507
- I know.
You have to interview all of us.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.384
- That's not
what I'm coming back for.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:43.685
- Omar?

01:39:48.357 --> 01:39:49.565
- I'll be right down.

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:58.199
Deirdre's always afraid
of missing her plane.

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.367
She never has.

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:00.535
- Have you?

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.245
- Maybe twice, three times.

01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:03.413
Whatever.

01:40:03.539 --> 01:40:05.581
There are worse things in life
than missing a plane.

01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:10.461
- Well,
try not to miss this one.

01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:12.255
- You're right.

01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:15.967
You know what I think?

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:18.219
Those bees
knew what they were doing.

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:23.307
They stung me so I'd remember
what I was here for.

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:25.351
Not for my own selfish reasons,

01:40:25.477 --> 01:40:27.812
not just to have a good time
and be happy-

01:40:27.938 --> 01:40:29.731
- But to get your PhD.

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.941
- And write the book.

01:40:32.067 --> 01:40:33.693
- And when it's published,

01:40:33.819 --> 01:40:35.903
I hope you'll send us
one copy each.

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:38.322
And please inscribe it,

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:42.493
"With best wishes,
from professor Razaghi, PhD."

01:40:42.619 --> 01:40:44.787
- Professor Razaghi.

01:40:44.913 --> 01:40:47.540
It sounds like a stage magician.

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:50.793
The kind that makes pigeons
fly out of a top hat.

01:40:52.296 --> 01:40:54.297
- And saws girls in half.

01:41:22.201 --> 01:41:23.284
Go on.

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:33.336
- Here you are.

01:41:33.462 --> 01:41:35.713
We're going to miss the plane.

01:41:35.839 --> 01:41:37.173
- Good-bye, Deirdre.

01:41:37.299 --> 01:41:40.718
I hope you and Omar have a safe
and pleasant journey.

01:41:40.844 --> 01:41:44.097
- Thank you for everything.

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:45.473
Good-bye.

01:41:51.146 --> 01:41:52.313
- Bye.

01:43:14.813 --> 01:43:15.855
- Hey, Omar.

01:43:15.981 --> 01:43:17.523
- Where you going, Omar?
- I'm in a hurry.

01:43:17.649 --> 01:43:19.317
- Oh, come on.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:23.070
Knock it off!

01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:25.323
- Hey!

01:43:33.957 --> 01:43:35.541
- In 500 words for Monday,

01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:38.794
I want you to analyze the role
of fate in hardy's novel.

01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:42.673
In Shakespeare,
character is always fate.

01:43:42.799 --> 01:43:44.508
Which we know by now
from experience

01:43:44.635 --> 01:43:45.843
to be absolutely true.

01:43:45.969 --> 01:43:48.012
What happens to me happens

01:43:48.138 --> 01:43:52.016
because I am I.

01:43:52.142 --> 01:43:54.101
Hardy's characters
are caught in situations

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:57.772
that are impossible
to get out of.

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:01.859
But are they impossible?

01:44:01.985 --> 01:44:04.612
Suppose a character decides
that he can do something

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.781
about his fate.

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:07.949
What then?

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:11.452
Any hands?

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:12.620
Come on, guys.

01:44:32.182 --> 01:44:37.561
âª âª

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:49.782
- It's Omar.

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:15.558
Omar, I found your shoe.

01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:16.892
- My shoe?

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:19.562
- The one you lost
when the bee stung you.

01:45:19.688 --> 01:45:21.063
Do you still have the other one?

01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:22.273
Then you can wear them.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:26.235
Thank you, Portia.

01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:28.112
As a matter of fact,
I did keep it

01:45:28.238 --> 01:45:30.406
as a souvenir from my bee sting.

01:45:30.532 --> 01:45:34.118
- I'll go and get it.

01:45:34.244 --> 01:45:35.953
- You can't do this.

01:45:36.079 --> 01:45:37.413
It's wrong.

01:45:37.539 --> 01:45:40.750
Walk in, walk out
whenever it suits you.

01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:42.084
No, you can't.

01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:43.294
- I should have written.

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:44.712
- Yes, you should have written.

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:46.172
- I tried to.

01:45:46.298 --> 01:45:48.466
You don't know
how often I tried,

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:49.967
how many letters I didn't send.

01:45:50.093 --> 01:45:53.262
- A postcard even,
instead of silence, nothing,

01:45:53.388 --> 01:45:54.430
not a word,

01:45:54.556 --> 01:45:55.973
as if we no longer existed.

01:45:56.099 --> 01:45:57.141
- You don't understand.

01:45:57.267 --> 01:45:58.434
- What don't I understand?

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.020
- I was always thinking,
"Go there.

01:46:01.146 --> 01:46:02.480
Go there.
Go there."

01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:04.148
I knew I had to do something.

01:46:04.274 --> 01:46:06.025
I wish
I could have done it right.

01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:07.943
If there was one thing
I could give you,

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:10.821
it would be for once
to do something right.

01:46:10.947 --> 01:46:13.449
- Well, you can't just
appear like this,

01:46:13.575 --> 01:46:14.950
horribly upsetting everyone

01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:17.912
by turning up
in these fantastic ways.

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.789
- So I should just sit
and do nothing

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:21.707
and suffer
and miss you?

01:46:21.833 --> 01:46:22.875
- Oh, please, go.

01:46:23.001 --> 01:46:24.835
Just go, Omar.

01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:38.265
- I wanted to give him
his shoe.

01:46:59.162 --> 01:47:00.162
- Omar.

01:47:00.288 --> 01:47:02.123
- Hi, Pete.
- Come in.

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:07.086
- Thank you.

01:47:07.212 --> 01:47:11.215
- I'll get you some dry socks.

01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:12.550
- Hail to thee, dear boy.

01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:13.717
Where have you sprung from?

01:47:13.844 --> 01:47:16.262
Come and sit down.

01:47:16.388 --> 01:47:18.347
Make yourself warm.

01:47:18.473 --> 01:47:20.391
Sit here.
Would you like a drink?

01:47:20.517 --> 01:47:21.892
- Please.
- Good.

01:47:34.573 --> 01:47:35.906
Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:47:36.032 --> 01:47:37.450
- You seem to have developed
the habit

01:47:37.576 --> 01:47:39.410
of popping up at the most
extraordinary times.

01:47:39.536 --> 01:47:41.787
- I'm clumsy and a fool.

01:47:41.913 --> 01:47:43.747
- I used to call myself that.

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:45.791
But now Pete has set us up
as a corporation,

01:47:45.917 --> 01:47:48.127
I'm not a fool anymore.

01:47:48.253 --> 01:47:49.962
I'm a business.

01:47:50.088 --> 01:47:51.130
And how's your business?

01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:53.632
- I've given it up,
the biography.

01:47:53.758 --> 01:47:54.800
I'm not writing it.

01:47:54.926 --> 01:47:56.260
- Oh.

01:47:56.386 --> 01:47:57.595
Well, quite frankly,
it seemed to me

01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:58.804
that it was, um-

01:47:58.930 --> 01:48:00.139
What was her name?
Deirdre.

01:48:00.265 --> 01:48:02.183
It seemed to me
that it was Deirdre's project

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.685
more than it was yours.

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.812
- Before I even came here,

01:48:06.938 --> 01:48:08.898
I lost a dog.

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:12.359
And searching for it,
I nearly drowned in a swamp.

01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:14.278
And then it happened again.

01:48:14.404 --> 01:48:15.696
I lost a dog.

01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:19.283
The same dog, Victor.

01:48:19.409 --> 01:48:22.036
And looking for him,
I came to the same swamp,

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:25.456
and I thought, "Oh, no.
No, not again."

01:48:25.582 --> 01:48:27.374
But I was sinking,

01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:30.461
not in that swamp
but in the biography,

01:48:30.587 --> 01:48:32.630
my whole life.

01:48:32.756 --> 01:48:34.215
- Well, I haven't
the foggiest notion

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:35.883
of what you're talking about,
dear boy,

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:37.718
but obviously, you've come
all the way back here

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.011
to save yourself from sinking.

01:48:39.137 --> 01:48:40.179
Welcome.

01:48:40.305 --> 01:48:41.972
- Arden told me to leave.

01:48:42.098 --> 01:48:43.474
She said
I had no right to come here.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.392
- Oh, we're always saying
things we don't mean,

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:46.977
especially in this family.

01:48:47.103 --> 01:48:49.647
In fact, we often say
the opposite of what we do mean.

01:48:49.773 --> 01:48:52.149
- Adam sends me away every day.

01:48:52.275 --> 01:48:53.859
He says it's better that way.

01:48:53.985 --> 01:48:55.653
- Yes, "It's better that way,"
which means,

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:57.404
I can't bear it, but I will.

01:48:57.531 --> 01:48:58.989
It's the Jewish mother in me,
you see.

01:48:59.115 --> 01:49:00.282
- What should I do?

01:49:00.408 --> 01:49:01.450
- Go and see her again.

01:49:01.576 --> 01:49:03.327
- But what if she tells me
to leave again?

01:49:03.453 --> 01:49:05.829
- Then come back here
and tomorrow try again,

01:49:05.956 --> 01:49:09.166
and the day after that
and the day after that.

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.545
- Omar!

01:49:31.147 --> 01:49:32.231
- Come on.

01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:49.206
- This ought to be good.

01:49:49.332 --> 01:49:51.458
- Don't forget he was only
10 or 12 when he wrote it.

01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:52.626
Be kind.

01:49:56.172 --> 01:49:58.215
Hang on.

01:49:58.341 --> 01:49:59.425
I think I know her.

01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:04.805
Excuse me.

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.224
Aren't you Caroline Gund?

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:08.726
I'm Deirdre.
We met in-

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.477
- Ocho Rios, of course.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:11.729
How could I forget?

01:50:11.855 --> 01:50:14.315
- Hello.

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:16.150
Nice to meet you.
This is Tim.

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.318
- Hello, nice to meet.

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.819
- Do you live here in Madrid?

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:20.863
- No, no, we're just visiting.

01:50:20.989 --> 01:50:22.072
We live in New York.

01:50:22.198 --> 01:50:23.240
- Really?
So do I.

01:50:23.366 --> 01:50:25.993
I teach at Columbia.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.244
Do you ever hear from them?

01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:28.579
- I do occasionally.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:29.747
They all seem very happy.

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:31.373
They've turned the land
into vineyards.

01:50:31.499 --> 01:50:32.499
And there's a baby.

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:33.917
- A baby?

01:50:34.044 --> 01:50:35.252
A boy or a girl?

01:50:35.378 --> 01:50:36.879
- A girl.

01:50:37.005 --> 01:50:39.840
A little sister for Portia.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.383
And they still keep bees.

01:50:41.509 --> 01:50:42.968
- Oh.
Those bees?

01:50:43.094 --> 01:50:44.094
- It's a business now.

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.846
They sell the honey.

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:48.265
- How funny to meet you
like this after all these years,

01:50:48.391 --> 01:50:52.394
and we both
live in New York now.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.562
- Well.

01:50:53.688 --> 01:50:57.107
- Good-bye.

01:50:57.233 --> 01:50:58.275
- Who's that?

01:50:58.401 --> 01:50:59.943
- That's a crazy story.

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:03.781
- She's not very-
- Give me a second.

01:51:03.907 --> 01:51:05.574
Caroline.

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:06.950
Call me.

01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:08.118
I'm in the phone book.

01:51:08.244 --> 01:51:09.578
The only Deirdre Rothemund,

01:51:09.704 --> 01:51:11.038
West 84th.

01:51:35.063 --> 01:51:36.647
- So who was that?

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:38.524
- Someone I met once

01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:40.484
in Uruguay, of all places,

01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:44.238
three years ago.

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:50.536
- What were you doing
in Uruguay?

01:51:50.662 --> 01:51:55.374
- I was sent for.
A friend needed me.

01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:00.504
Did you know
that a bee sting can be fatal?

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:03.549
Was it fatal?
Did he die?

01:52:03.675 --> 01:52:05.634
- No.
He recovered.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.137
But it a profound
psychological effect.

01:52:11.266 --> 01:52:19.273
âª âª

01:52:44.299 --> 01:52:46.175
- Will you call her?

01:52:46.301 --> 01:52:50.304
- She's friendlier
than I remember.

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:52.389
- What happened?

01:52:52.515 --> 01:52:53.849
- It's a long story.

01:52:53.975 --> 01:52:55.017
- Tell me.

01:52:55.143 --> 01:52:59.438
- Shh.

01:52:59.564 --> 01:53:01.732
- I'll tell you later.

01:53:04.861 --> 01:53:10.866
