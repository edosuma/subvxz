02:17.887 --> 02:19.680
- Victor.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.974
Victor!
Victor, come on!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.643
Ooph!

02:24.769 --> 02:25.811
Bad dog.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.616
Charles!

02:39.742 --> 02:40.784
- Oh, hi.

02:40.910 --> 02:41.952
Oh, what have you been doing?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.787
There's South American stamps
on here.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.623
You must know somebody
in Uruguay, Mr. Razaghi.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.584
- Sort of.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.127
- I hope it's good news.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.295
- Thank you.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.801
- "We do not see the need
for an authorized

02:57.927 --> 03:00.512
"biography of Jules Gund
at this time,

03:00.638 --> 03:02.598
nor at any time in the future"?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.266
- Why would they
deny me authorization?

03:04.392 --> 03:05.767
It's not like
everyone in the world

03:05.894 --> 03:09.646
is working on a biography
of Jules Gund.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.148
- Which one is Caroline Gund?

03:11.274 --> 03:12.441
- The widow.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.485
There's a daughter too,
but she didn't sign.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.529
- So who's Arden Langdon?

03:17.655 --> 03:21.909
- She's the uh...
mistress, I guess.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.660
Adam Gund, that's the brother.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.746
And Ocho Rios is the place

03:25.872 --> 03:28.081
where they all lived together
when Jules Gund was alive.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.499
- That's quite a setup:

03:29.626 --> 03:33.420
the brother, the widow,
the lover, a daughter.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.673
That's probably why they don't
want to authorize a biography.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.260
It's too tortured
and incestuous.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.512
Wait.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.681
"Your request has prompted
much discussion

03:44.807 --> 03:47.017
amongst the trustees."

03:47.143 --> 03:50.395
That could mean
they don't all agree.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.994
You'll have to go to Uruguay.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.371
- What?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.872
After that letter?

04:08.998 --> 04:10.165
- Confront the three executors

04:10.291 --> 04:11.959
and make them
change their minds.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.794
It may be easier than you think.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.212
- But they said "no."

04:15.338 --> 04:17.255
- Mm.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.423
You know perfectly well

04:18.548 --> 04:20.132
that without
getting their permission,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.469
there's no fellowship, no money,
no biography,

04:22.595 --> 04:26.306
and no new contract for you
at the university.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.685
Omar, you'll never
get another teaching job.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.729
And what else can you do?

04:32.855 --> 04:33.981
- Nothing.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.274
- Exactly.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.042
I forgot to heat the milk.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.419
Do you think it matters?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.839
- I've never heard of a sublet
that comes with a dog,

04:58.965 --> 05:01.174
and one
with such an elaborate diet.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.854
- How could you do that,
fall in a puddle?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.105
- It wasn't a puddle.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.607
It was quicksand.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.775
- For you, it's quicksand.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.278
For everyone else,
it's a puddle.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.113
It's like you have this
subconscious drive

05:23.239 --> 05:28.785
to fall in, to mess up.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.454
I think I should come with you

05:30.580 --> 05:32.414
to Uruguay.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.333
I've had more experience
with things like that.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.500
- No.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.252
I think I should go by myself,

05:37.378 --> 05:41.465
if I decide to go.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.467
- Well, if you decide to go,

05:43.593 --> 05:46.636
I think it would be better
for us to do it together.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.807
Better for us
individually and as a couple.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.101
- I think it'll be better
for both of us

05:53.227 --> 05:54.936
individually and as a couple

05:55.063 --> 05:56.772
if I were to go by myself.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.899
But I appreciate your offer.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.942
- You appreciate my offer?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.986
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.114
- Omar, it's me, Deirdre.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.742
You don't appreciate my offer.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.536
- I almost drowned in quicksand.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.622
I saw my life
flash before my eyes,

06:13.748 --> 06:17.292
and I did not like what I saw.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.294
I've decided to change my life.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.214
I have to be,
you know, more independent.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.590
Like other people.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.402
- I don't want you
to be like other people,

06:43.528 --> 06:45.112
to change.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.664
- Oh, what's wrong, buddy?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.666
You want to go outside?
Let's go outside.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.834
Come on.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.001
Come on!

07:00.128 --> 07:01.878
Oh.
Buddy.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.004
- Hopeless.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.132
- Out you go.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.939
- If you fly to Miami first,

07:21.065 --> 07:24.192
it's nonstop from there
to Montevideo.

07:24.318 --> 07:28.822
But that's horribly expensive.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.282
- What about Victor?

07:30.408 --> 07:31.741
- He's not your dog.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.909
We'll put him in a pound.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.745
Most of them
have a 30-day grace period.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.539
You can redeem him
when you get back.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.291
- Deirdre,

07:39.417 --> 07:40.459
he's part of the house-sit.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.626
I'm responsible for him.

07:41.752 --> 07:47.591
We can't just throw him
in the pound.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.134
- Ah, this is better.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.261
From Houston to Sao Paulo,

07:51.387 --> 07:53.472
then Montevideo.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.891
For some reason,
it's much cheaper.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.311
Ah, it takes much longer.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.062
Don't do that now.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.530
I'm hurt.

08:54.784 --> 08:55.825
- Señor.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.953
- Si.
- Por favor.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.386
- Are you coming to Ocho Rios?

10:38.512 --> 10:39.554
That's my house.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.848
- You speak English.
- Of course.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.183
And Spanish.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.601
- I'm Omar.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.269
Omar Razaghi.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.437
- I'm Portia.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.439
Why are you coming to Ocho Rios?

10:49.565 --> 10:50.899
- I want to write a book.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.361
I want to write a biography
about Jules Gund.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.029
Have you heard of him?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.614
- He was my father.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.699
- Your father?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.159
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.885
This is Omar.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.303
He's writing a book.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.722
This is my mother.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.515
- Mrs. Gund?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.600
I'm Omar Razaghi.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.935
I wrote you the letter

12:09.061 --> 12:10.311
about the biography.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.148
- My name's Arden Langdon.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.483
Caroline...

12:15.609 --> 12:18.653
she's Mrs. Gund.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.946
But we wrote to you.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.114
We said no.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.657
We very definitely said no.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.160
- Yes, that's why I'm here.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.746
I'm hoping
you'll change your minds.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.789
I guess
I should have written first.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.375
It was very wrong of me
to come like this.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.210
I have to find a hotel.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.587
- Where?

12:35.713 --> 12:38.506
There's nothing except
this place for miles and miles.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.426
- I can sleep outdoors
in the garden,

12:41.552 --> 12:42.594
if you'll let me.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.762
- Don't be ridiculous.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.929
Now that you're here,

12:45.055 --> 12:46.514
there's nowhere else
for you to go,

12:46.640 --> 12:49.184
so till we can get you
back into town,

12:49.310 --> 12:50.852
we'll have to let you stay.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.562
- Really?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.491
- Mad women and Englishmen:

13:46.617 --> 13:49.327
why they would want to walk here
in the sun is beyond me.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.915
Of course, those two ladies
are always beyond me.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.545
Can you help me with my cravat,
please?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.255
You know,
I've always liked this cravat.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.799
I bought it in Venice in 1966.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.300
I must have been happy
at the time.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.720
Otherwise, why would I have
bought such a beautiful thing?

14:07.847 --> 14:12.058
I look very handsome in that.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.602
- They're walking like...

14:14.728 --> 14:16.062
they're bringing important news.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.898
- Oh, what news?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.985
Great tidings at Ocho Rios.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.320
They do look serious,
don't they?

14:24.446 --> 14:26.573
Supposing we...

14:26.699 --> 14:29.492
stuck by our decision
to refuse authorization.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.995
- Then he shall have come
very far for nothing.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.998
- Yes, but he can still
write the biography

14:35.124 --> 14:36.499
without authorization.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.252
That is,
without our help and consent.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.504
That would give him
quite a free hand, wouldn't it?

14:41.630 --> 14:43.339
To make up things,
to make up stories,

14:43.465 --> 14:45.091
twist the facts.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.426
You know, once these people,

14:46.552 --> 14:48.094
these biographers
turn against you,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.179
they can become quite vicious.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.016
- Oh, he didn't look
as if he could ever be that.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.893
- How do you know?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.311
You only saw him
for five minutes

14:56.437 --> 14:58.688
before at once
inviting him to stay.

14:58.814 --> 15:02.609
- He looked so tired
and helpless somehow.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.776
- And young and handsome.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.111
- Oh, really?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.654
- That has nothing
to do with it.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.365
- Anyway, Jules said he didn't
want a biography of himself.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.702
He said it was like having
one's corpse publicly exhumed.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.538
- Oh, when did he say that?

15:15.664 --> 15:17.206
- In a letter to me years ago.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.459
- My god.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.836
Well, if we were
held accountable

15:21.962 --> 15:24.130
for the things we wrote in
letters millions of years ago,

15:24.256 --> 15:25.882
my dear,
where would any of us be?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.508
But he must have told you
other things.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.552
Um, for instance,
that he would be married

15:29.678 --> 15:32.055
and faithful to you
forever and ever.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.389
- He was.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.391
He stayed married to me.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.643
- Oh.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.145
And Arden didn't count,
or Portia?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.898
- Caroline didn't say that.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.245
The days pass,
and we live together,

15:56.372 --> 15:57.830
Caroline and I,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.332
and we manage it.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.834
Quite well, I think.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.586
And now this.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.591
Adam's so moody nowadays.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.426
- It's because of you.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.972
He's afraid you'll leave him.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.557
I used to live like that,

16:16.684 --> 16:21.562
always afraid
that Jules would leave me.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.399
He'd get into those black moods,

16:24.525 --> 16:28.277
not speak to me for days on end,

16:28.404 --> 16:29.904
not to anyone,

16:30.030 --> 16:32.281
not to Caroline.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.284
And I thought
that she'd turn against me

16:35.411 --> 16:37.954
and get him to send me away.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.497
Where would I go?

16:40.916 --> 16:42.375
Where would I go?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.336
- That's all in the past.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.466
- Yes, it's strange.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.636
Everything's easier.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.638
But now
when some stranger arrives...

16:55.764 --> 16:57.640
- Is he young and handsome?

16:57.766 --> 17:00.685
- It depends
what you mean by that.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.937
Can you find any more teaspoons?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.194
How can we just send him away?

17:11.320 --> 17:13.239
Tell him,
"Good-bye; go home"?

17:13.365 --> 17:14.406
- We're not.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.117
We're even letting him stay
in the house.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.660
We're being very friendly.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.788
- But then he might start to
think we've changed our minds.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.248
- That's his problem.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.291
I can be friendly
without changing my mind.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.211
- Well, he must have come here
with such hope.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.547
- Let's think about this.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.008
A biography would stimulate
interest in Jules' work,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.385
and that is something that we,

30:07.263 --> 30:10.474
I was the one who found him.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.103
- So near to the house?

30:15.230 --> 30:16.438
- Come on.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.158
Blew the top of his head
right off.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.494
I'm glad it was me
who found him

30:30.620 --> 30:34.164
and not one of the others.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.292
The odd thing
is that we all stayed here.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.005
- No, thank you.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.508
- Anyway,

30:44.634 --> 30:46.635
here we all are...

30:46.761 --> 30:48.178
including me.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.390
- Where are you from originally?

30:51.516 --> 30:54.518
- From Tokunoshima.

30:54.644 --> 30:57.187
A small island.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.566
I was poor with no family.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.318
When I was 14,

31:03.444 --> 31:06.780
someone liked me enough
to take me with him to England.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.497
Here.

31:15.623 --> 31:20.085
I find this old furniture
and make it look older.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.839
A lady comes twice a year
from New York and buys it.

31:23.965 --> 31:28.844
She says I have a good eye.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.638
Adam used to work at Christie's
in London.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.682
- Hello, Mr. Gund.
- Hello.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.517
- He sent me to a school there

31:35.643 --> 31:37.436
where I learned everything
about furniture.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.771
That was 25 years ago.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.273
- Yes.

31:41.399 --> 31:45.027
We're about to have our
silver anniversary, aren't we?

31:45.153 --> 31:47.154
Ready?
Should we go?

31:50.992 --> 31:52.951
I've ordered us
a platter of grilled meat

31:53.077 --> 31:54.202
and some red wine.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.370
- Not too much for me.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.039
I'm a bit of a lightweight,
I'm afraid.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.042
- Really?
How sad.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.544
What about all those
drunken Persian poets of yours?

32:02.670 --> 32:05.380
What about Hafez?

32:05.506 --> 32:06.548
"Bring me a cup of red wine

32:06.674 --> 32:08.634
that is dark red
and smells of musk..."

32:08.760 --> 32:10.427
- "Don't bring me
that expensive stuff..."

32:10.553 --> 32:11.720
- "That tastes like money..."

32:11.846 --> 32:13.055
"And smells like lust."

32:16.184 --> 32:18.810
So now, about the biography.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.313
Please understand,
unlike my two sisters-in-law,

32:21.439 --> 32:22.731
or the two ladies,
I should say,

32:22.857 --> 32:23.899
I'm on your side.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.817
- You are?
- Entirely on your side.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.486
See, I've been trying
to explain to them

32:27.612 --> 32:30.155
that to revive an interest
in Jules Gund and his work,

32:30.281 --> 32:32.741
a biography
would be invaluable to us.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.534
- Well, if only
I could convince everyone.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.161
I would be very respectful
of the past,

32:36.287 --> 32:37.329
everyone's feelings.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.247
- My dear boy,
he was my brother.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.916
I knew him better than anyone.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.250
I knew him when we were still

32:42.377 --> 32:44.294
tearing the wings
off butterflies.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.545
I was eight years older,

32:45.672 --> 32:48.507
but it was he who invented
all the little torments

32:48.633 --> 32:50.342
an older brother
inflicts on the younger.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.219
We were both sent to school
in England.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.470
I was utterly miserable,

32:53.596 --> 32:55.681
but he, when in a system,
was in his element.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.266
I suspect it was there at school
that he began to learn

32:58.393 --> 33:01.520
how to exert power
over those who adored him.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.440
It's that simple.

33:05.566 --> 33:09.611
So we must work together,
you and I.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.780
We must co-conspire.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.408
I hadn't thought of conspiring.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.742
- Well, of course not.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.581
Ah!

33:21.708 --> 33:23.250
Gracias.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.418
- Ooh!

33:36.723 --> 33:37.764
- This is Mrs. Van Euwen.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.225
The chatelaine
of Las Golondrinas,

33:40.351 --> 33:41.476
our local grand dame.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.769
Very grand.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.818
- Local color, you know?

33:49.944 --> 33:52.154
I told them all they would see
was red meat.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.363
- Yes.

33:55.783 --> 33:56.825
- Worse,

33:56.951 --> 33:59.619
why do you keep your new friend
away from me?

33:59.746 --> 34:01.455
- Oh, yes, he's very beautiful,
isn't he?

34:01.581 --> 34:03.123
Yes, I thought
you'd be interested.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.751
This is-
he's blushing.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.169
- Ooh!
- This is Omar Razaghi.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.337
He's come to do research
on my brother's biography.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.422
- Mucho gusto.
- Ah!

34:11.549 --> 34:13.132
Then you must research me.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.177
I can tell you
things about Jules

34:15.303 --> 34:16.969
that a brother
could never know...

34:17.096 --> 34:18.847
or a wife or even a mistress.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.476
You should write his life,
his and Pete's.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.271
That a more interesting story,
yeah.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.481
- Go away.
Go away.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.149
Thank you.
- I go. I go.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.110
You should come
to Las Golondrinas.

34:48.543 --> 34:49.628
- Have a sausage.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.004
- Is it pork?

34:51.130 --> 34:52.172
- Maybe.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.340
I don't know.

34:55.134 --> 34:59.179
You don't drink;
you hardly eat meat.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.515
Um...well, as I said before,

35:01.641 --> 35:02.682
I know I can trust you.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.017
I feel I can ask you
for your help

35:04.143 --> 35:06.394
as you're asking for mine.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.064
- Like I said, I'll do anything.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.066
- Wait, wait,
this is non-literary.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.735
It's nothing to do
with the biography.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.071
When our mother-that is,
Jules' mother, my mother-

35:16.197 --> 35:18.073
when our mother arrived here
as a refugee,

35:18.199 --> 35:21.284
she brought with her from
Germany some valuable things,

35:21.410 --> 35:22.911
her jewelry.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.080
Now, I have her jewelry.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.124
And I would like
to dispose of it,

35:27.250 --> 35:32.462
and I would like you to help me
dispose of it.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.755
- Is it legal?

35:33.881 --> 35:34.923
- Is what legal?

35:35.049 --> 35:37.592
- Taking these things
out of the country?

35:37.718 --> 35:39.469
- No, it's moral.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.804
They're my things.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.639
They were my mother's.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.267
When she arrived here,
she hid them away.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.768
Because of her experiences
in Germany,

35:46.894 --> 35:47.936
she trusted no one.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.896
She didn't feel safe anywhere.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.482
Outside of this cocoon
that they built here,

35:52.608 --> 35:56.153
why, she and my father
didn't feel safe on this planet.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.782
So after her death,
very shortly after my father's,

36:00.908 --> 36:02.117
I found the jewels.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.953
- Do Arden and Caroline know
about them?

36:05.079 --> 36:06.121
- Nope.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.039
They know nothing
of that history.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.624
Even Caroline
hardly knew my mother.

36:09.750 --> 36:14.129
She certainly knew nothing
of what was precious to her.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.964
So I took the jewels.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.009
I felt I could assume
that they were mine

36:19.135 --> 36:22.971
as Caroline, in due course,
felt free to take what was hers.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.556
- From what your mother left?

36:24.682 --> 36:28.476
- With Caroline,
it was what my brother left.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.728
Have you never thought,

36:29.854 --> 36:32.564
never suspected that
there might be another book?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.815
- Other than The Gondola?

36:33.941 --> 36:35.442
- Mm-hmm.

36:35.568 --> 36:39.571
- It is well known, Jules Gund
wrote only that one book.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.825
- Well, he was working
on another one when he died.

36:43.951 --> 36:47.078
It is my theory that he died,
or killed himself,

36:47.205 --> 36:50.332
because he couldn't...

36:50.458 --> 36:52.167
couldn't write anymore.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.752
Or because of what
he was writing

36:53.878 --> 36:56.755
or trying to write.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.465
A psychological impasse.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.634
- Caroline has the manuscript?

37:00.760 --> 37:03.261
- I don't know.
You have to ask her.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.679
But that is not the subject

37:04.805 --> 37:06.848
of our present little talk,
is it?

37:06.974 --> 37:08.099
My jewels.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.518
My need for money.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.895
Ah, here's Pete.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.532
Hail to thee!

38:04.198 --> 38:05.240
Come upstairs.
Follow me.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.533
I want to show you something.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.873
It is not for myself
that I need the money;

38:14.000 --> 38:15.041
it is for Pete,

38:15.167 --> 38:18.712
who may be free to leave me.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.297
- Does he want to leave you?

38:20.423 --> 38:21.589
- He should.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.385
He still has a chance at
a better life than with me here.

38:25.511 --> 38:27.554
You know, in order to bring him
here to Uruguay,

38:27.680 --> 38:30.223
I had to adopt him.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.559
Legally, he is my son.

38:38.482 --> 38:42.610
Come and sit down, please.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.739
- I'll do what you ask.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.949
- Even though it's illegal
and dangerous?

38:48.075 --> 38:50.910
- I think
it's the right thing to do.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.747
If you can trust me
not to screw it up.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.623
- Ah, we shall see.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.460
Please, sit down.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.627
So here's the treasure.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.755
Some of it is mixed up
with my father's.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.673
That's my father's watch.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.134
Mother used to keep them
locked in the safe,

39:06.260 --> 39:09.679
but sometimes she'd take it out
and wear it for me to show me.

39:09.805 --> 39:10.889
And, uh...

39:11.015 --> 39:14.267
I was her favorite, you know,
her firstborn,

39:14.393 --> 39:16.269
her Adam, she called me.

39:17.605 --> 39:20.190
Of course,
Jules could never get over that.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.150
She would show me
how she wore them

39:22.276 --> 39:25.362
and where.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.781
This at the opera.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.616
She had much smaller wrists
than mine.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.785
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

39:31.911 --> 39:32.994
Go on, you can take it.

39:33.120 --> 39:37.123
It's all right.

39:37.249 --> 39:43.004
And these at the Burgtheater.

39:43.130 --> 39:47.133
- Isn't that beautiful?

39:47.259 --> 39:50.845
Oh, yes, and this little horse
was for the races.

39:50.971 --> 39:54.641
And she'd wear this
attached to her cloche hat.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.428
- It's me, Omar Razaghi.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.934
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.519
- I'm just having my breakfast.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.814
Come in.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.529
- Oh.
No, thank you.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.206
- You don't have to say
anything nice about it.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.833
- No, I like it.
It's very interesting.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.418
- It's only a copy.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.587
That's all I do nowadays,
is copies,

41:05.713 --> 41:07.088
copy the masters.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.339
It's safer.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.593
That way,
I don't reveal anything.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.636
It's what art does,

41:13.762 --> 41:14.929
even biography.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.890
Especially biography.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.809
- I would be very discreet.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.437
I would absolutely
respect your wishes

41:22.563 --> 41:23.938
as to what to reveal.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.615
- What if I were to tell you
that Jules explicitly said

41:33.741 --> 41:37.285
he didn't want a biography
of himself?

41:37.411 --> 41:39.621
He wrote it to me in a letter.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.748
I suppose
you'd want to see that letter.

41:41.874 --> 41:42.916
- Well, yes.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.542
I'd like to very much.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.503
- And why
would I show it to you?

41:46.629 --> 41:49.005
I don't know anything about you,

41:49.131 --> 41:54.469
no more than you know about me
or ever will.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.598
What if I were to ask you,
have you ever been in love,

41:58.724 --> 42:02.560
passionately in love?

42:04.939 --> 42:06.648
See, you can't answer me.

42:06.774 --> 42:07.899
You're not sure.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.317
- I am sure.

42:09.443 --> 42:13.404
- Do you have a girlfriend?

42:13.531 --> 42:14.739
A partner?

42:14.865 --> 42:17.075
- Why do you want to know?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.577
- Are you romantically involved?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.538
- Yes.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.164
I suppose I am.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.499
- Suppose?

42:24.625 --> 42:27.001
That doesn't sound very
positive, let alone passionate.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.837
- We've been together two years.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.590
Her name is Deirdre.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.509
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

42:34.635 --> 42:38.429
I mean, here in Uruguay.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.015
I would have accepted
your decision.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.183
I would have given up.

42:42.309 --> 42:45.353
- I see.

42:45.479 --> 42:48.356
Sit.

42:48.482 --> 42:51.901
So it is your friend Deirdre

42:52.027 --> 42:54.153
who made you come
to change our minds.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.780
And what if
you can't change our minds?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.031
What will she think?

42:57.157 --> 42:59.200
She'll think you failed.

42:59.326 --> 43:00.368
- Yes.

43:00.494 --> 43:02.120
And she'd be right.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.663
I will have failed.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.540
- Sometimes it's good to fail,

43:05.666 --> 43:07.125
to try but to fail.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.793
There's nothing ignoble in that.

43:08.919 --> 43:09.961
- You don't understand.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.379
Everything depends on it:

43:11.505 --> 43:13.298
my job, my career,

43:13.424 --> 43:15.925
maybe my relationship
with my girlfriend.

43:18.929 --> 43:22.390
- You're so young.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.559
Are you sure that's
what you want your life to be

43:24.685 --> 43:27.478
forever and ever:

43:27.605 --> 43:30.523
that job, that career,

43:30.649 --> 43:32.942
that girlfriend?

43:36.530 --> 43:41.659
I'll show you
a real picture I painted.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.162
It's Jules, only it's not him,

43:44.288 --> 43:46.914
not as he really was,
which only I knew.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.917
You don't see it
because I couldn't paint it.

43:50.044 --> 43:54.922
I wasn't good enough
to paint it.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.884
I suppose now you'll write
how the widow of Jules Gund

43:58.010 --> 43:59.927
is sitting
in a south American jungle

44:00.054 --> 44:03.598
painting atrocious paintings
and slowly going mad

44:03.724 --> 44:05.058
or not so slowly.

44:05.184 --> 44:08.102
- I promise to write nothing
you don't want me to write.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.104
- Point is,
I want you to write nothing.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.856
- If you could just give me
one reason.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.107
- I don't have a reason.

44:13.233 --> 44:15.276
As anyone will tell you,
I am an unreasonable person.

44:15.402 --> 44:16.778
Jules himself
would have told you that

44:16.904 --> 44:17.945
if he'd still been here.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.114
In fact,
it's the very word he used

44:20.240 --> 44:22.784
when he felt I wasn't
being accommodating enough

44:22.910 --> 44:24.452
to his arrangements.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.454
"You're so unreasonable,
Caroline."

44:26.580 --> 44:27.622
- I'm sorry.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.040
I shouldn't have come here.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.958
- Don't apologize.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.211
No, it's good sometimes
to hear another voice.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.379
I was beginning to think

44:34.505 --> 44:36.005
that apart from
our little group here,

44:36.131 --> 44:37.924
there was no one else
left in the world.

44:42.429 --> 44:50.436
♪ ♪

45:12.126 --> 45:13.876
- Do you want to hear
how Arden met Jules?

45:14.002 --> 45:15.086
- Yes.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.380
- Omar doesn't want
to know that at all.

45:17.506 --> 45:21.134
- He's writing a book;
he has to know everything.

45:21.260 --> 45:24.470
- Mm-hmm.

45:24.596 --> 45:28.891
- Um...I was traveling
around Spain

45:29.017 --> 45:32.395
when I met some people
going to Uruguay.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.480
So I went with them,

45:34.606 --> 45:37.316
and they turned out
to be a missionary group

45:37.443 --> 45:41.404
sent to convert
the heathen of south America.

45:43.198 --> 45:44.949
- Don't laugh.

45:45.075 --> 45:48.578
Our name was joyful noise.

45:50.622 --> 45:54.667
And we went around in a bus
and gave concerts in the street.

45:54.793 --> 45:56.169
We never drew much of a crowd,

45:56.295 --> 45:59.839
but people listened
very politely.

45:59.965 --> 46:01.257
But by the time we'd finished,

46:01.383 --> 46:03.926
there was usually
only one or two left.

46:04.052 --> 46:07.054
But we went right on singing
and playing.

46:07.181 --> 46:11.601
- Arden shook the tambourine.

46:11.727 --> 46:16.606
- Anyway, one day,
Jules stopped to listen.

46:16.732 --> 46:21.235
And when we were through,
he came up to me and said,

46:21.361 --> 46:22.779
"What are you doing?

46:22.905 --> 46:25.281
And why are you doing it?"

46:25.407 --> 46:27.074
So I stopped.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.493
- And then I was born.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.912
- Well,
not quite so quickly, darling.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.080
- Nine months later, anyway.

47:18.001 --> 47:20.962
- I'm packing a picnic lunch.

47:21.088 --> 47:24.131
- Why are you going on a picnic?

47:24.258 --> 47:26.717
- I'm taking Omar
to show him the gondola.

47:26.844 --> 47:30.137
- Why?

47:30.264 --> 47:32.056
As if that gondola
isn't the most ludicrous

47:32.182 --> 47:34.642
of all the ludicrous
collected items here.

47:34.768 --> 47:35.810
- I don't feel that.

47:35.936 --> 47:39.313
- No...

47:39.439 --> 47:43.818
You've changed your mind
about the biography.

47:43.944 --> 47:46.320
Well, haven't you?

47:47.948 --> 47:50.324
Why shouldn't he
write the biography?

47:50.450 --> 47:51.659
He seems-

47:51.785 --> 47:54.996
he's just the right person
to understand Jules.

47:55.122 --> 47:56.664
- In what way
is he the right person?

47:56.790 --> 47:58.833
Because he's good-looking
and charming

47:58.959 --> 48:01.919
and because he's charmed you?

48:02.045 --> 48:05.590
What is it?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.133
I'm sorry.

48:07.259 --> 48:11.095
It's just that what we decided
before still stands for me.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.763
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.850
- Tell me what?

48:15.976 --> 48:17.810
- Do you know
he's in love with someone?

48:20.981 --> 48:23.357
- I didn't know that.

48:23.483 --> 48:24.942
- He told me he has a fiancée.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.110
Maybe they're not engaged,

48:26.236 --> 48:28.321
but he has
a romantic attachment.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.948
- Why are you telling me this?

48:31.074 --> 48:33.326
- Because I thought
you should know.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.536
- It has nothing to do
with anything.

48:35.662 --> 48:40.291
- I never said that it had,
but I wouldn't blame you.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.500
You're lonely.

48:41.627 --> 48:44.128
- I'm not lonely.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.297
Or maybe I am
and I didn't know it

48:46.423 --> 48:48.883
until there was a new person.

48:49.009 --> 48:54.055
When do we ever see anyone
or get to talk to anyone?

48:54.181 --> 48:55.806
And now-

48:55.933 --> 48:58.142
why are you talking to me
like this?

48:58.268 --> 48:59.852
Why do you want to hurt me?

48:59.978 --> 49:03.022
- I don't want to hurt you.

49:03.148 --> 49:05.691
I never wanted to hurt you.

49:05.817 --> 49:08.402
- Hola!

49:08.528 --> 49:10.738
- So you're off
to see the gondola.

49:10.864 --> 49:12.073
- Oh, yes.

49:12.199 --> 49:15.743
You'll be coming with us?

49:15.869 --> 49:18.663
- I've been there.

49:20.791 --> 49:21.916
- Mmm.

49:22.042 --> 49:24.168
- Maybe we shouldn't go.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.419
It's a long way.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.923
- Uh, well, if you're not
feeling up to it.

49:29.049 --> 49:31.759
- Well, if you're not allowed
to write the biography,

49:31.885 --> 49:33.552
there's no point in going.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.055
And Caroline
won't change her mind.

49:36.181 --> 49:38.265
That's the way she is.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.935
She has a much stronger
character than I have.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.103
- That's not true.

49:42.229 --> 49:43.437
- Oh, but it is.

49:43.563 --> 49:44.730
Jules used to say that

49:44.856 --> 49:48.234
any breeze could come
and blow me any which way.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.903
But actually,
why shouldn't we go?

49:51.029 --> 49:52.113
- Right.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.614
Why shouldn't we?

50:04.584 --> 50:06.544
- Whoa.

50:22.936 --> 50:24.270
Who won?

50:24.396 --> 50:25.938
- We did.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.612
- I have to go find Arden.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.448
- She is showing Omar
the gondola.

50:35.574 --> 50:36.615
- Without me?

50:36.742 --> 50:38.325
- They'll take you another time.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.286
- What if Omar goes away?

50:40.412 --> 50:41.662
Is he going away?

50:41.788 --> 50:45.166
- Do you want him to stay?

50:45.292 --> 50:47.043
- Definitely.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.841
- Do you live alone?

50:53.967 --> 50:55.509
- Yes.

50:55.635 --> 50:58.471
- But you have a girlfriend.

50:58.597 --> 51:02.141
- Yes.
I do.

51:02.267 --> 51:04.226
- What's her name?

51:04.352 --> 51:05.519
- Her name is Deirdre.

51:05.645 --> 51:10.024
She teaches
at the same university.

51:10.150 --> 51:11.650
- What does she teach?

51:11.777 --> 51:14.487
- Literature, like me.

51:14.613 --> 51:17.990
She's a good teacher.

51:18.116 --> 51:20.701
Much better than I'll ever be.

51:20.827 --> 51:24.163
The great Russians
and German poets.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.750
- Sorry, I'm being rude.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.668
I'm not used to meeting
new people,

51:29.795 --> 51:34.090
so I don't know
how to behave anymore.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.133
I shouldn't ask you
all those questions.

51:36.259 --> 51:39.220
- But think of all the questions
I want to ask you.

51:42.557 --> 51:45.184
Is all of this your land?

51:45.310 --> 51:48.938
- Pete keeps trying
to make us sell some of it,

51:49.064 --> 51:53.109
or at least lease it
for a vineyard or something.

51:53.235 --> 51:54.693
And we could do with the money,

51:54.820 --> 51:57.488
but you see how we all are.

52:05.205 --> 52:08.249
- There's no quicksand here,
is there?

52:08.375 --> 52:10.376
A swamp you could sink into?

52:10.502 --> 52:13.462
- Oh, well, yes,
there's lots of swamps.

52:13.588 --> 52:14.922
So watch out.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.931
What's wrong?

52:24.057 --> 52:26.976
- I...

52:27.102 --> 52:29.812
I feel a bit strange.

52:29.938 --> 52:31.438
Can't be the altitude.

52:31.565 --> 52:33.774
- Oh, no, we're at sea level.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.776
Maybe you're just hungry.

52:35.902 --> 52:36.944
Come on.

52:37.070 --> 52:39.738
- Maybe.

52:39.865 --> 52:41.615
- I want you to know,

52:41.741 --> 52:44.994
I've changed my mind
about the biography.

52:45.120 --> 52:49.540
Why should I be afraid
of stirring up bad memories?

52:49.666 --> 52:50.708
There aren't any.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.668
There's Portia

52:52.794 --> 52:56.630
and this lovely place
for her to grow up in.

52:56.756 --> 52:58.966
I want you to write the book.

52:59.092 --> 53:01.385
Like Adam, I'm on your side.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.387
I give you my-what is it?

53:03.513 --> 53:05.764
My-my authorization.

53:12.314 --> 53:16.233
You know, I came here
to write one kind of book.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.776
- No, thanks.

53:21.448 --> 53:25.993
- And now it's turning
into something different.

53:26.119 --> 53:30.831
Like, it's no longer
about Jules

53:30.957 --> 53:34.001
but about you-all of you.

53:34.127 --> 53:36.670
And your life here

53:36.796 --> 53:39.840
and even about me here with you.

53:39.966 --> 53:42.176
Does that make sense?

53:42.302 --> 53:44.553
No? It doesn't?

53:44.679 --> 53:48.265
- Well, not entirely,
but you said you were feeling...

53:53.980 --> 53:55.147
- Oh.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.671
May I get in?
- Yeah.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.969
It needs painting.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.387
I keep wanting to do it.

54:26.513 --> 54:27.554
- I'll help you.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.556
I'd like to do that.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.643
- Caroline hates the gondola
more than anything.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.603
I don't know why.

54:56.293 --> 55:00.921
- What's she like,
Deirdre?

55:01.047 --> 55:05.759
- She's very determined.

55:05.885 --> 55:08.262
Very strong personality.

55:08.388 --> 55:12.224
She decides what needs
to be done and does it.

55:12.350 --> 55:13.767
- That's how I'd want to be.

55:13.893 --> 55:15.519
- Well, so would I.

55:15.645 --> 55:17.062
I don't suppose
I'll ever manage it.

55:18.356 --> 55:19.565
- Me neither.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.255
Can you help me get out?
- Oh, sure.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.578
More, more.

56:19.501 --> 56:21.210
- Portia.

56:21.336 --> 56:24.505
Pete, I wish
you wouldn't let her do this.

56:24.631 --> 56:25.714
You're not even protected.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.926
- You want to help?
- No.

56:31.721 --> 56:33.472
- Gracias.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.057
- Can't I do it?
- No.

56:35.183 --> 56:36.934
Certainly not.
You're not to climb up there.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.143
- I'll do it.
- Not at all.

56:38.269 --> 56:39.645
- Can I help?
- Sure.

56:39.771 --> 56:42.940
Take the net
up the other ladder.

56:43.066 --> 56:44.942
- I'll take that.

56:55.787 --> 57:00.040
Portia, stay away
from the bees.

57:00.166 --> 57:02.167
- Pull the net towards you.

57:02.293 --> 57:06.713
- Let me get higher.
- Okay.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.382
A little more.
- Okay.

57:11.886 --> 57:13.971
Ow!

57:14.097 --> 57:15.139
- Careful.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.475
Omar.

57:18.601 --> 57:19.643
- Ow!

57:21.438 --> 57:22.563
- Omar!
- Omar!

57:22.689 --> 57:23.772
thud!

57:27.026 --> 57:28.152
- No!

57:29.612 --> 57:31.113
- Omar?

57:31.239 --> 57:32.865
Omar.

59:38.324 --> 59:40.701
Oh, Omar.

59:40.827 --> 59:43.453
Omar, the doctor's
made a mistake.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.081
He thinks I'm your girlfriend.

59:49.168 --> 59:53.964
Can you hear me?

59:54.090 --> 59:58.635
Can you feel me?

59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.137
But it's all right.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:03.473
I found Deirdre's phone number
in your book.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.852
I left a message on her machine.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:11.565
Maybe she'll come soon,
and then everything-

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.983
can you hear me?

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.736
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:19.489
Deirdre's coming.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.950
Oh, please blink.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.187
- No way.

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:30.811
- Let me just show you
your bedroom and bathroom.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.939
Did you know Omar was allergic
to bee sting?

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.148
- I did not.

01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:38.985
But I'm not surprised.

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:50.997
- Are those gauchos?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.165
- No.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.459
Oh, yes.
Gauchos.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:58.338
Cowboys.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:00.340
There's something
I must tell you.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:01.842
No, thanks.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:04.177
The doctor, Dr. Pereira,

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:08.724
he's taken very good care
of Omar, but, um...

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.977
he's made a silly mistake.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:16.273
He thinks I'm Omar's lover.

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:18.650
- Oh.

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:20.527
- It's the sort of thing
he would think.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:21.987
He's Latin American.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.322
They see the world
in a certain way.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.534
But I didn't correct him.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.327
- Why not?

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:34.332
- As I said, Dr. Pereira
is the way men are here.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:37.586
They like to think
of men and women involved,

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.963
romantically involved.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.215
I thought that
if the doctor thinks that,

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:46.428
that Omar is loved-
that I love him-

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:50.140
then he would
take very special care of him.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.308
- Moo!

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.018
- But of course,
now that you're here...

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.437
- No, that's all right.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:57.105
Whatever works best for Omar,

01:02:57.231 --> 01:03:00.192
I don't care
what a doctor thinks.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:02.360
Let him think I'm Omar's sister.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.488
- Oh, you don't look
like his sister,

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:08.200
nothing like.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:28.470
- He's in this ward,

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.638
on the right.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:30.806
I'll wait outside.

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.265
- Okay, thank you.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:07.717
- Mm.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.137
My god.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.807
Why are you here?

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:16.726
- Arden called me.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.311
You were in a coma.

01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:25.735
Has Arden been visiting you?

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.988
- Have you met her?

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.739
- Of course,
I'm staying in the house.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.242
- Don't you like it?

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.785
Isn’t it amazing,

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:36.997
the house and everything?

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:41.251
- Do you remember what happened?

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.421
With the bees?

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.673
- No.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:50.468
I don't remember anything
that happened that day clearly.

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.185
- Are you a friend
of our poor Omar?

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.438
- Yes, I'm very worried
about Omar.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.689
- You must not worry.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.357
You are too beautiful to worry.

01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:08.028
All the women who visit Omar
are beautiful.

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:11.114
His recovery
has nothing to do with me.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.034
It is the beauty of women
that cured him.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.641
- Where did you
get these pajamas?

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:38.892
- I don't know.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:42.228
I woke up wearing them.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.981
- Did Arden bring them?

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.900
They may have belonged to Jules.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:49.819
You are wearing
Jules Gund's pajamas.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:53.239
- Mmm.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.992
- Do you think she's changed
her mind about authorization?

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.495
- Well, I'm not very sure
about Caroline.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:05:59.871
- We'll see about her.

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:01.331
What about Arden?

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:04.209
- She's leaning my way.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:07.253
Our way.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.381
- And the other one,
the brother?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.716
- Adam?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:11.842 --> 01:06:13.426
- He's always been on my side.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.428
And he says
he'll help me with Caroline,

01:06:15.554 --> 01:06:16.763
and I said I'd help him.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.098
- Help him with what?

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.766
What can you help him with?

01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:21.434
- It's nothing, really.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.478
He just wants me
to carry something for him

01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:25.397
when I go back to the States.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:26.940
- Carry what?

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:30.568
- Just some things.

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:32.445
- What things?

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:33.613
- Some...

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:35.573
pieces of jewelry.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.867
Stuff like that.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.035
- Jewelry?

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:42.789
Did you say you would?

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:45.792
Omar, you're crazy.

01:06:45.918 --> 01:06:47.085
It's smuggling.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.712
He's asking you
to smuggle for him.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.922
You'll go to jail.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.008
- He wouldn't ask me
to do anything criminal.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.175
He's not that type.

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:56.261
- Anyone who asks you
to take something

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.138
secretly out of the country
for him

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.973
is that type.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.684
- He's been very helpful to me
with the biography.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.935
And that's what I'm here for:

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:05.937
to get authorization
for the biography.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:07.647
- This is not the way to get it.

01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:09.733
- I'm doing it my way.
Everything's fine.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.484
- Everything is not fine, Omar.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.486
If it were, I wouldn't be here.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:14.779
- I didn't ask you to come here.

01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:16.156
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.992
I flew 5,000 miles
because you were in a coma.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.160
A coma!

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:21.369
- Stop.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.955
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

01:07:24.081 --> 01:07:27.292
I just-I wish you wouldn't
treat me like a baby.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.960
- Then don't act like a baby.

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:30.962
Don't agree to smuggle jewelry.

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.422
Don't fall out of a tree.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.841
- Falling out of a tree
was an accident.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.551
- You know what I think
about accidents.

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:38.970
- Accidents happen to people,
Deirdre.

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:42.891
We can't all be perfect
like you.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:45.810
- I'm not perfect.

01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:48.730
I know I'm not perfect.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.023
I don't think I am.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.317
I'm just trying
to help you, Omar,

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:56.488
because I love you.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:58.448
You really wish I hadn't come?

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:01.451
- No.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.744
- Because I can leave.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.037
I can leave whenever you want.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.705
- No.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.040
Want you to stay.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:17.884
- Omar,
you've broken your wrist.

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.345
Let me wipe the soup
off your face.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:38.238
- Adam!

01:08:42.408 --> 01:08:45.245
- So how is
our poor young friend?

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.455
I hear he's recovering.

01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:50.082
- His girlfriend has arrived

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:51.792
to comfort him,

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:55.004
and hopefully
to take him home.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.090
Where's Pete?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.591
- Taking a shower.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.685
So...

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.856
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.566
It really is a pleasure,
you know?

01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:28.037
Well, here we are.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.457
To the pleasure of you.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:36.296
- How sweet you are.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.796
- Not bad.

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:38.965
Not bad at all.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.800
Please, sit down.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.926
- It's supposed to be
a cocktail.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.140
- Cocktail.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:50.643
What a lovely word.

01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:52.353
If only one could drink it

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.314
where a cocktail
should be drunk,

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.399
sitting on a barstool

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:59.777
somewhere dark, secluded.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:00.945
But liquor is liquor

01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:02.614
wherever you go in the world,
isn't it?

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.491
- It's a Manhattan,

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.411
or half a Manhattan,
since you have no bourbon.

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:09.829
- A Manhattan.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:11.998
That's your Moscow.

01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:13.166
Hmm?

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.168
"Oh, Olga, Olga,
let us go to Moscow.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.503
There's no place in the world
like Moscow."

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.925
- Adam, I want to ask you,

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.676
do you think
I was wrong to stay here?

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:26.095
- What do you mean?

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.598
- You know what I mean.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:32.185
When Jules came back
with Arden.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.770
- I didn't judge you.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.481
It was your affair and Jules'.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.191
- She was so pathetic.

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:39.859
It was as if he'd picked up
a stray kitten

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:42.779
and brought it home,

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.489
a pregnant kitten.

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.699
- Yeah.

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:49.118
- Now I think she's changed
her mind about the biography,

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.536
as you have.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:51.746
- I never opposed it.

01:10:51.872 --> 01:10:52.914
Why should we?

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.874
A biography is nothing,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.876
an account of the facts
written by,

01:10:57.002 --> 01:11:00.046
well, just for all we know,
some academic hack.

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.714
Though I hope not.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.800
Maybe he'll surprise us.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.218
Poor boy.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:06.803
What a thing to happen.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.471
A bee, can you imagine?

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.139
- It's his own fault.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.307
Why did he come here?

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.977
He has no business here,
hack or not.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:17.146
- Supposing Jules
had written something himself.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.649
Had he?

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.109
Yes, he had.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.402
I thought so.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.321
And it would have to be
personal, autobiographical,

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.824
'cause Jules
was not an inventive writer.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.159
And as The Gondola
was about our parents' lives,

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.828
this other manuscript-

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.663
- Which no longer exists.

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.498
- Which no longer exists...

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:39.669
would be about his life with you
and Arden in this place.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.422
And for all I know,

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:45.842
even about Pete and me.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:50.179
- How could any outsider
understand this place

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:54.058
or what it was like
to all live here together

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:57.603
or what it's like now
without him?

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.272
- Yes.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.109
You know,
you could leave tomorrow

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:04.652
if you wanted to,

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:06.779
any time you choose.

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:09.907
- You very well know,
I have no money.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.076
How could I get
the fare together?

01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:13.745
Don't you think I haven't
thought of it,

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.122
that I don't sit up there
pretending to paint,

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:19.459
brooding over
where I might be instead?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.626
I need a real drink.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.629
How about you?

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.298
Scotch.
- Yeah.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.800
- Not getting very far
on just vermouth.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:34.098
Adam, do you like life?

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.977
Well, I wouldn't like
to live forever.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:42.106
But um, for a little while,
yes, but...

01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:44.275
yes, I like it.

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:45.818
- But living here?

01:12:45.944 --> 01:12:47.487
You wouldn't rather
be somewhere else,

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:48.654
New York, London?

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.823
- No.
- Why not?

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:52.617
- Because you have
to care about-

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:55.661
or at least pretend to care
about everything:

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:58.122
politics, fashion, culture.

01:12:58.248 --> 01:12:59.499
It's just exhausting.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.210
- What I wouldn't give
to see some new painters,

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:05.963
a new play, go to the opera.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.508
Yes, I know.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.344
To Moscow, Olga.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.972
- Yeah.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.682
This is a very potent drink.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:20.103
Perhaps I should not
have indulged in a refill.

01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:26.526
Tell me something.
Was there ever a letter?

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.735
Did Jules really write to you

01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:29.445
saying he didn't want
a biography?

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.613
- No.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.073
But I know
he wouldn't have wanted it.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.282
- How would you know that?

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.992
- Because he destroyed
the manuscript.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.162
- He destroyed it himself?

01:13:38.288 --> 01:13:39.497
- He wanted no one to know

01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:42.333
what only concerned himself
and me.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:44.168
So no matter
what you and Arden decide,

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:47.213
I shall never allow
this biography to be written,

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:49.632
even if he gets stung
by 100 bees.

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:02.603
- Excuse me.

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:05.064
Can you tell me the way
to the mill house, please?

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:07.567
- You have to go back this way

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:11.612
and then
through the bamboo grove.

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:12.905
- Through there.

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:14.073
- Thank you.

01:14:18.912 --> 01:14:20.538
- What do you think of her?

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:22.457
- What do you?

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:25.585
- I don't see her with Omar,

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.044
her personality.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:30.173
But I don't know either of them
very well.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.467
What do you think?

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.479
Will you miss them
when they're gone?

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.564
- No.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.649
- I mean Omar.

01:14:48.775 --> 01:14:49.984
Will you miss Omar?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.992
Do you love him?

01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:01.496
- No.

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:07.293
No, I don't love Omar.

01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:10.046
What?
Why did you ask me that?

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:13.216
Omar didn't say anything to you
about me

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.301
when you went to see him
in the hospital?

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:17.094
- No,
I just thought,

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.971
if I were you...

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:22.725
- If you were me, what?

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.810
- I might love him.

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:28.564
Well, it's as you said, Pete.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.899
We hardly know him.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.568
He's only been here
for a short time,

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.153
he has a girlfriend,

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:35.988
and he's leaving soon.

01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:38.908
The doctor says he can travel
in a few days.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.993
They're both leaving.

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:42.161
I'm glad.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:04.433
- Mr. Gund?

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.644
- Who calls?

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.853
- Hello.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.355
- Hello.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:11.691
- I could come back another time
if you're not free.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.109
- Not free?

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.860
As you can see, I'm quite free,

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.529
hopelessly free,

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.948
for the rest of my life.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:22.326
This is Jesus,
and you must be, uh...Deborah.

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:23.494
- Deirdre.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.037
- Deirdre.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:27.373
May I offer you something?

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:29.667
- Oh, just some mineral water
if you have it.

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:31.627
- Mineral water, hmm.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:32.962
How about a dry martini?

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.298
No.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.465
No, thank you.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:39.385
- So you must be,
um...Omar's paramour.

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.137
It's so difficult
finding the right word

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.305
to describe a relationship.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.640
At least my relationships.

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.393
They're all too complicated
for mere words.

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.228
- Paramour
is not the right word.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:53.149
I wouldn't use it to describe
Omar's and my relationship.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.860
- Do sit down, my dear.
You look as if you might bolt.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:58.821
I've offended you, no doubt.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.157
Good.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.325
You know, in my youth,

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.577
I used to call my partners
my paramours.

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.371
It's such a lovely word
to describe a lovely situation.

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:11.083
And as a result, I remained
a youth for a very long time.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:13.586
The aging process was retarded,
but alas,

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:16.255
one morning I woke up and-

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:18.924
I was an old man
who talks too much.

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.760
But it is you who've come
to talk to me, yes,

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.889
I have no doubt,
about the authorization.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:28.100
As you've probably heard,
I'm on Omar's side.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:30.436
We have made our arrangement.

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:32.229
- That is what I've come
to talk to you about,

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.231
what you call an arrangement.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.399
- So he has told you about it?

01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:40.112
- He has,
and I consider it blackmail.

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:42.615
You said you had made a bargain
with Omar.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.909
You asked him to smuggle
certain items out of the country

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.119
in return for your help
in getting him authorization.

01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:48.537
I...

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:49.914
call that blackmail.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.749
- "Smuggle," "blackmail."

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:54.960
My, my, you do have
a romantic imagination.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.587
- I will not allow him to do it.

01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:58.381
And besides,
he's the wrong person for it.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.548
- I agree with you.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.217
Omar is certainly not
the right person.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:04.178
Unlike you, he is not practical.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:10.101
But you will be returning
to the United States as well?

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:12.186
- Are you trying to make
a little bargain with me now?

01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:13.354
- Please, do sit down.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.939
I'm enjoying your company.
Sit down.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.482
You're so invigorating.

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:18.401
It's a pity
you have no sense of adventure.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.277
- I certainly have a sense
of what's legal

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.779
and what is not.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:24.532
- You know,

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:26.283
one day, you will regret this.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:29.620
You will regret having come
all the way to south America

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:33.791
and not involving yourself
in what you encounter here.

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.668
You will think, "Oh, why?

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:39.130
Oh, why
did I not smuggle those things?"

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:41.257
- So it is smuggling.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.803
- Well, you read too many books.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:47.847
Or perhaps you don't even
read books anymore.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.975
You probably just read
criticism of books.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.476
- Mr. Gund,

01:18:52.602 --> 01:18:54.979
you must consider your little
bargain with Omar dissolved.

01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:56.147
Neither he nor I

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.023
will be able to help you
in this business.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.233
We'll have to get Caroline

01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:01.235
somehow to agree
to authorization without you.

01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:04.029
- Mm-hmm.
How will you do that?

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.740
- We can try,

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.575
honestly try,

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.453
without resorting to bargains
and blackmail.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.747
- Hmm.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.417
It seems a bit stupid to me,
if I may be so blunt,

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:19.086
to alienate me like this.

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.714
After all, what is stopping me
changing my mind?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.048
- Oh.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.050
Excuse me, I...

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.344
I understood
you wanted a biography.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:32.933
I didn't think your support
was variable or could be bought.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:36.353
Gracias, Jesus.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.774
Gracias.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.402
Well, I admire your gumption.

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:45.738
But I think it best

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:49.617
that this situation be resolved
between Omar and myself.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:51.410
The arrangement was made
with Omar,

01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:54.121
so it is up to Omar
to dissolve it.

01:19:54.247 --> 01:19:56.457
I have enjoyed our little chat.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:01.170
Please excuse me.

01:20:14.392 --> 01:20:22.399
♪ ♪

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:37.498
- Mrs. Gund.

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:43.295
♪ ♪

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:46.841
These are lovely.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.552
- Are you fond of art?

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:50.761
- It's not my field,

01:20:50.887 --> 01:20:55.224
but some paintings
I like very much.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.392
I have been hoping to talk-

01:20:56.518 --> 01:21:01.146

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:15.779
You've only just
come out of the hospital.

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.864
You're not yourself.

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:19.658
And really,
you're not in a fit state

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:21.451
to go running
after crazy Caroline.

01:32:21.577 --> 01:32:23.662
- Please, Deirdre,

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.080
leave it to me.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.248
- Darling-

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.624
- Would you just let me rest?

01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:16.881
- Omar, "Las Golondrinas"

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:20.468
means little birds
that fly and sing.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:24.973
That is what we do here,
as you can see.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:28.059
Jules was always welcome here.

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:30.812
He lived with his two women
at Ocho Rios,

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:35.317
and sometimes
he had to come up for air...

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:38.153
when Caroline
was too much for him.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.988
- And Arden was too little.

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.243
- Don't you want to swim?

01:33:45.369 --> 01:33:46.911
We have plenty of suits.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:48.246
Yes?

01:33:48.372 --> 01:33:50.832
You don't have to put that arm
in the water, no?

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.500
El bracito en el agua,
¿para que?

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:53.668
No.

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:57.130
Traele...traele, Wilson...

01:33:57.256 --> 01:33:58.590
- No, no, no.
- ¿Como no, no, no, no?

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:01.259
Si.
Plunk! Plunk! Plunk!

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:09.893
Jules was very, very attractive.

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.770
And depressive, of course.

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.439
But that made him
even more attractive,

01:34:14.565 --> 01:34:17.609
like Hamlet
or someone out of Dostoyevsky.

01:34:19.236 --> 01:34:22.781
He had the knack
of making each woman he met

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:27.077
feel she was the only one
who truly understood him.

01:34:27.203 --> 01:34:28.370
Only women.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:29.788
He didn't care for men,

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.207
nor they for him.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.126
And he was writing this book,

01:34:35.252 --> 01:34:38.338
another book
to make him even more famous.

01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:39.756
We thought it was thrilling.

01:34:39.882 --> 01:34:42.008
Perhaps we were all in it.

01:34:42.134 --> 01:34:45.804
And each one of us
thought she was his muse.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.765
And would go down in history,
no?

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:58.817
- God knows
what she's telling him.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:00.360
Every woman who ever met Jules

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:04.114
is convinced she understood him
better than I did,

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.491
or Arden, for that matter.

01:35:06.617 --> 01:35:09.869
- You know what I think?

01:35:09.995 --> 01:35:13.206
That he wasn't writing a book
at all.

01:35:13.332 --> 01:35:15.208
He was talking about it

01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:17.544
to impress us,

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:20.547
but he found he couldn't.

01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:24.968
And that made him-

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.469
he couldn't bear the thought

01:35:26.595 --> 01:35:29.889
of not being
a celebrated author anymore.

01:35:30.015 --> 01:35:34.144
Admired and famous and...

01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:37.272
and everyone
hopelessly in love with him.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:41.776
Ah, Wilson.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:42.944
- Señora.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.112
- Gracias.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:50.869
Permiso.

01:35:52.621 --> 01:35:54.038
- Tango.

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:55.582
Tango.
Puedes.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.542
- Puedo.
- Puedes.

01:35:57.668 --> 01:35:59.669
- Puedes.
- Puedo, puedo.

01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:09.846
- Maybe we'll meet
in the States.

01:36:09.972 --> 01:36:11.264
I'd like that very much,

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:15.185
although maybe you prefer
to forget all about me.

01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:17.437
- I want to give you
a farewell present.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:20.106
About the biography,
go ahead and write it.

01:36:20.232 --> 01:36:23.443
Explain us to ourselves,
if you can.

01:36:23.569 --> 01:36:24.944
I'll be interested

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:28.573
to read your interpretation
or invention.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:34.788
I grant you my authorization.

01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:36.247
lsn't that what you wanted?

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:38.666
What you came here for?

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:40.752
- Of course.

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:42.754
And I'm very grateful to you.

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:48.968
- Deirdre anyway,
will be pleased.

01:36:49.094 --> 01:36:51.805
- But what about Jules' letter
that he didn't want a biography?

01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:53.264
- Jules never wrote
such a letter.

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.475
I made that up.

01:36:55.601 --> 01:36:58.812
But he did try
and write a second book.

01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:01.105
There is a manuscript.
It does exist.

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:04.859
No one's ever read it except me.

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.027
Jules never finished it.

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:08.488
He couldn't.

01:37:08.614 --> 01:37:11.449
Shall I tell you
about the last scene?

01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:14.786
The last he wrote
and then he couldn't go on?

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:18.289
In this last scene, Arden and I
are in the gondola,

01:37:18.415 --> 01:37:21.209
and we loathe each other
as we never did.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.753
Though, perhaps
that's what he was waiting for.

01:37:23.879 --> 01:37:25.296
But in the gondola,

01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:27.465
we have a terrible fight,

01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:28.883
a physical fight.

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:31.553
And I push Arden overboard.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.804
But you know what?

01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:34.806
The water isn't deep enough.

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:38.560
So I keep on pushing her down
and down.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:41.145
- Did you intend to publish it?

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:43.064
- There were times
when I felt that I had to,

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.483
that it was a responsibility,
a duty,

01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:48.736
to literature, if that
doesn't sound too grandiose.

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:52.490
- I don't believe
any of us has such a duty.

01:37:52.616 --> 01:37:55.326
I believe literature
takes its life from us,

01:37:55.452 --> 01:37:56.995
not the other way around.

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:59.998
- Is this the belief
of a professor of literature?

01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:04.752
- Oh, I'm afraid
this is the other Omar,

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.505
the misguided caliph
who burned all the books.

01:38:07.631 --> 01:38:10.091
You know,
the entire library of Alexandria

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.176
was fed into
the bathhouse boilers,

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:15.138
700,000 papyrus scrolls.

01:38:15.264 --> 01:38:17.765
It took six months
to burn them all up.

You have to interview all of us.

Whatever.

Those bees
knew what they were doing.

They stung me so I'd remember
what I was here for.

Not for my own selfish reasons,

not just to have a good time
and be happy-

01:40:27.938 --> 01:40:29.731
- But to get your PhD.

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.941

01:40:44.913 --> 01:40:47.540
It sounds like a stage magician.

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:50.793
The kind that makes pigeons
fly out of a top hat.

01:40:52.296 --> 01:40:54.297
- And saws girls in half.

01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:38.794
I want you to analyze the role
of fate in hardy's novel.

01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:42.673
In Shakespeare,
character is always fate.

01:43:42.799 --> 01:43:44.508
Which we know by now
from experience

01:43:44.635 --> 01:43:45.843
to be absolutely true.

01:43:45.969 --> 01:43:48.012
What happens to me happens

01:43:48.138 --> 01:43:52.016
because I am I.

01:43:52.142 --> 01:43:54.101
Hardy's characters
are caught in situations

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:57.772
that are impossible
to get out of.

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:01.859
But are they impossible?

01:44:01.985 --> 01:44:04.612
Suppose a character decides
that he can do something

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.781
about his fate.

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:07.949
What then?

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:11.452

01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:07.943
If there was one thing
I could give you,

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:10.821
it would be for once
to do something right.

01:46:10.947 --> 01:46:13.449
- Well, you can't just
appear like this,

01:46:13.575 --> 01:46:14.950
horribly upsetting everyone

01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:17.912
by turning up
in these fantastic ways.

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.789
- So I should just sit
and do nothing

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:21.707
and suffer
and miss you?

01:46:21.833 --> 01:46:22.875
- Oh, please, go.

01:46:23.001 --> 01:46:24.835
Just go, Omar.

01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:38.265
- I wanted to give him
his shoe.

01:46:59.162 --> 01:47:00.162
- Omar.

01:47:00.288 --> 01:47:02.123
- Hi, Pete.
- Come in.

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:07.086
- Thank you.

01:47:07.212 --> 01:47:11.215
- I'll get you some dry socks.

01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:12.550
- Hail to thee, dear boy.

01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:13.717
Where have you sprung from?

01:47:13.844 --> 01:47:16.262
Come and sit down.

01:47:16.388 --> 01:47:18.347
Make yourself warm.

01:47:18.473 --> 01:47:20.391
Sit here.
Would you like a drink?

01:47:20.517 --> 01:47:21.892
- Please.
- Good.

01:47:34.573 --> 01:47:35.906
Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:47:36.032 --> 01:47:37.450
- You seem to have developed
the habit

01:47:37.576 --> 01:47:39.410
of popping up at the most
extraordinary times.

01:47:39.536 --> 01:47:41.787
- I'm clumsy and a fool.

01:47:41.913 --> 01:47:43.747
- I used to call myself that.

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:45.791
But now Pete has set us up
as a corporation,

01:47:45.917 --> 01:47:48.127
I'm not a fool anymore.

01:47:48.253 --> 01:47:49.962
I'm a business.

01:47:50.088 --> 01:47:51.130
And how's your business?

01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:53.632
- I've given it up,
the biography.

01:47:53.758 --> 01:47:54.800
I'm not writing it.

01:47:54.926 --> 01:47:56.260
- Oh.

01:47:56.386 --> 01:47:57.595
Well, quite frankly,
it seemed to me

01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:58.804
that it was, um-

01:47:58.930 --> 01:48:00.139
What was her name?
Deirdre.

01:48:00.265 --> 01:48:02.183
It seemed to me
that it was Deirdre's project

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.685
more than it was yours.

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.812
- Before I even came here,

01:48:06.938 --> 01:48:08.898
I lost a dog.

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:12.359
And searching for it,
I nearly drowned in a swamp.

01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:14.278
And then it happened again.

01:48:14.404 --> 01:48:15.696
I lost a dog.

01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:19.283
The same dog, Victor.

01:48:19.409 --> 01:48:22.036
And looking for him,
I came to the same swamp,

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:25.456
and I thought, "Oh, no.
No, not again."

01:48:25.582 --> 01:48:27.374
But I was sinking,

01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:30.461
not in that swamp
but in the biography,

01:48:30.587 --> 01:48:32.630
my whole life.

01:48:32.756 --> 01:48:34.215
- Well, I haven't
the foggiest notion

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:35.883
of what you're talking about,
dear boy,

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:37.718
but obviously, you've come
all the way back here

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.011
to save yourself from sinking.

01:48:39.137 --> 01:48:40.179
Welcome.

01:48:40.305 --> 01:48:41.972
- Arden told me to leave.

01:48:42.098 --> 01:48:43.474
She said
I had no right to come here.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.392
- Oh, we're always saying
things we don't mean,

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:46.977
especially in this family.

01:48:47.103 --> 01:48:49.647
In fact, we often say
the opposite of what we do mean.

01:48:49.773 --> 01:48:52.149
- Adam sends me away every day.

01:48:52.275 --> 01:48:53.859
He says it's better that way.

01:48:53.985 --> 01:48:55.653
- Yes, "It's better that way,"
which means,

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:57.404
I can't bear it, but I will.

01:48:57.531 --> 01:48:58.989
It's the Jewish mother in me,
you see.

01:48:59.115 --> 01:49:00.282
- What should I do?

01:49:00.408 --> 01:49:01.450
- Go and see her again.

01:49:01.576 --> 01:49:03.327
- But what if she tells me
to leave again?

01:49:03.453 --> 01:49:05.829
- Then come back here
and tomorrow try again,

01:49:05.956 --> 01:49:09.166
and the day after that
and the day after that.

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.545
- Omar!

01:49:31.147 --> 01:49:32.231
- Come on.

01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:49.206
- This ought to be good.

01:49:49.332 --> 01:49:51.458
- Don't forget he was only
10 or 12 when he wrote it.

01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:52.626
Be kind.

01:49:56.172 --> 01:49:58.215
Hang on.

01:49:58.341 --> 01:49:59.425
I think I know her.

01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:04.805
Excuse me.

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.224
Aren't you Caroline Gund?

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:08.726
I'm Deirdre.
We met in-

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.477
- Ocho Rios, of course.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:11.729
How could I forget?

01:50:11.855 --> 01:50:14.315
- Hello.

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:16.150
Nice to meet you.
This is Tim.

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.318
- Hello, nice to meet.

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.819
- Do you live here in Madrid?

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:20.863
- No, no, we're just visiting.

01:50:20.989 --> 01:50:22.072
We live in New York.

01:50:22.198 --> 01:50:23.240
- Really?
So do I.

01:50:23.366 --> 01:50:25.993
I teach at Columbia.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.244
Do you ever hear from them?

01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:28.579
- I do occasionally.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:29.747
They all seem very happy.

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:31.373
They've turned the land
into vineyards.

01:50:31.499 --> 01:50:32.499
And there's a baby.

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:33.917
- A baby?

01:50:34.044 --> 01:50:35.252
A boy or a girl?

01:50:35.378 --> 01:50:36.879
- A girl.

01:50:37.005 --> 01:50:39.840
A little sister for Portia.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.383
And they still keep bees.

01:50:41.509 --> 01:50:42.968
- Oh.
Those bees?

01:50:43.094 --> 01:50:44.094
- It's a business now.

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.846
They sell the honey.

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:48.265
- How funny to meet you
like this after all these years,

01:50:48.391 --> 01:50:52.394
and we both
live in New York now.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.562
- Well.

01:50:53.688 --> 01:50:57.107
- Good-bye.

01:50:57.233 --> 01:50:58.275
- Who's that?

01:50:58.401 --> 01:50:59.943
- That's a crazy story.

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:03.781
- She's not very-
- Give me a second.

01:51:03.907 --> 01:51:05.574
Caroline.

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:06.950
Call me.

01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:08.118
I'm in the phone book.

01:51:08.244 --> 01:51:09.578
The only Deirdre Rothemund,

01:51:09.704 --> 01:51:11.038
West 84th.

01:51:35.063 --> 01:51:36.647
- So who was that?

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:38.524
- Someone I met once

01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:40.484
in Uruguay, of all places,

01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:44.238
three years ago.

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:50.536
- What were you doing
in Uruguay?

01:51:50.662 --> 01:51:55.374
- I was sent for.
A friend needed me.

01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:00.504
Did you know
that a bee sting can be fatal?

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:03.549
Was it fatal?
Did he die?

01:52:03.675 --> 01:52:05.634
- No.
He recovered.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.137
But it a profound
psychological effect.

01:52:44.299 --> 01:52:46.175

01:52:46.301 --> 01:52:50.304
- She's friendlier
than I remember.

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:52.389
- What happened?

01:52:52.515 --> 01:52:53.849
- It's a long story.

01:52:53.975 --> 01:52:55.017
- Tell me.

01:52:55.143 --> 01:52:59.438
- Shh.

01:52:59.564 --> 01:53:01.732
- I'll tell you later.
