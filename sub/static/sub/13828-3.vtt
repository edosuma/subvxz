WEBVTT

00:07.195 --> 00:08.570
Go!

00:10.615 --> 00:13.022
Come on, Drew! You've got this!

00:13.201 --> 00:15.692
Keep your guard up, Drew! Come on!

00:21.376 --> 00:23.036
Go, Drew!

00:26.839 --> 00:29.330
Do the arm with the thing and the...

00:36.974 --> 00:39.466
- Come on!
- Already started? What'd I miss?

00:39.644 --> 00:43.262
Drew's eating a lot of punches,
but I think we won the first round.

00:43.439 --> 00:47.519
- So were you with Landry?
- Define "with."

00:47.694 --> 00:51.276
Good God! To be you for one day.

00:56.077 --> 00:57.405
Yeah!

00:58.413 --> 01:01.698
- How's Lynn doing?
- She's not exactly thrilled...

01:01.874 --> 01:05.492
that her parents are having twins,
or that they are actually having sex.

01:05.795 --> 01:09.460
- You have sex?
- Not as much as you, but periodically.

01:11.134 --> 01:14.300
All right, get back in there,
get back in! Get in there, Drew!

01:14.470 --> 01:16.344
Krista's really into this.
Who knew?

01:16.514 --> 01:17.629
Come on, take him down!

01:20.601 --> 01:24.053
I'm sorry, why is this fun?
Getting punched is not fun.

01:24.230 --> 01:25.808
You this crazy out of work?

01:25.982 --> 01:29.315
- I'd like to see you on the weekend.
- Clinch! Give him a knee!

01:29.485 --> 01:32.901
Dude, you know you have no chance,
right? She's so into Drew.

01:36.242 --> 01:37.653
Fight over, fight over!

01:37.827 --> 01:40.911
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

01:42.790 --> 01:44.664
- Yeah!
- Someone call a medic!

01:44.834 --> 01:46.910
Stay down, relax,
we'll take care of you.

01:48.171 --> 01:49.416
I'm a doctor.

01:49.589 --> 01:52.874
Possible depressed orbital fracture
with inferior rectus entrapment.

01:53.051 --> 01:54.510
Set up a trauma panel
and facial CT.

01:54.635 --> 01:56.712
- Did you do this to him?
- Page the surgeon.

01:56.888 --> 01:59.426
Take him to curtain one,
give him five of morphine.

01:59.599 --> 02:03.264
- Let me know when the CT comes in.
- Hey, we're gonna take care of you.

02:04.479 --> 02:06.352
You're making patients now?

02:06.522 --> 02:08.229
He was trying to do the same to me.

02:08.399 --> 02:12.100
With all the time and money you put
into training, it seems like a dumb risk.

02:12.278 --> 02:13.905
What if you get hurt
and you can't work?

02:13.988 --> 02:16.823
Then you become my problem.
Please don't become my problem.

02:16.991 --> 02:18.699
- I won't.
- Good, now clean up...

02:18.868 --> 02:20.825
- because, man, you stink.
- No good?

02:20.995 --> 02:23.569
- Get out of here.
- She's on a rampage.

02:23.790 --> 02:26.411
Hey, give the guy a break.

02:26.584 --> 02:30.249
Not every doctor's into playing golf
like your country club boyfriend.

02:30.421 --> 02:32.793
How is it that you look worse
than the two men...

02:32.965 --> 02:34.590
with their faces bashed in?

02:34.759 --> 02:36.882
You can't just get rid of the Tailgate.

02:37.053 --> 02:39.591
We need a place where we can relax
during our breaks.

02:39.764 --> 02:43.382
- You got food trucks and a break room.
- The break room's haunted.

02:47.397 --> 02:50.481
A man tried to commit suicide
from the Tailgate.

02:50.650 --> 02:51.812
It's a liability issue.

02:51.984 --> 02:55.816
Not to mention the 70 other
OSHA violations up there.

02:55.988 --> 03:00.235
It should've been closed
a long time ago. Move on.

03:00.743 --> 03:02.866
Hey, Paul, do me a favour.

03:03.037 --> 03:06.323
Grab Resusci Annie out of the
supply room and move it to the lounge?

03:06.499 --> 03:10.283
- I've got to run up to the lab.
- Yeah, no problem, got it.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.388 --> 03:23.057
Really? Okay.

03:28.688 --> 03:33.231
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's alive!

03:35.111 --> 03:37.104
Really? Not cool.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.522
Interns are supposed to
stick together, right?

03:39.699 --> 03:41.941
- Oh, yes, it's alive!
- It's alive!

03:42.118 --> 03:45.321
TC, hunting accident out near Medina.
Ambulance can't get to them.

03:45.496 --> 03:47.952
- Medevac's waiting.
- I'm on it. Paul, you're up.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.289
- Okay.
- Come on, Paul!

04:05.308 --> 04:07.799
I thought you guys
would never make it. Follow me.

04:07.977 --> 04:10.729
Henry got attacked by a hog
and fired his crossbow...

04:10.897 --> 04:15.191
and hit Amy. Now be careful,
a lot of these hunters are pretty wasted.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.233
Oh, look out!

04:20.740 --> 04:23.409
- Guys, where you at?
- What is this place?

04:23.576 --> 04:26.779
It's a hunting ground.
Feral hogs are mean sons of bitches.

04:26.954 --> 04:28.662
It's open season.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.032
They're right over here.

04:40.426 --> 04:41.469
It's okay, ma'am.

04:41.636 --> 04:44.803
Paul, focus on the primary
trauma survey, ABCDE.

04:44.972 --> 04:47.890
Airway, patent. Good air movement.

04:48.059 --> 04:52.555
- Help! Help!
- She's stable, I gotta help this guy.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.064
It's all right, buddy, I'm a doctor!

04:56.234 --> 05:00.362
Hey, tell your guys to stop firing,
or I'll shove those guns up their asses!

05:00.530 --> 05:05.357
My hand.
Damn hog just bit off my hand!

05:08.329 --> 05:11.781
Paul, I need a suture kit,
a needle driver, ten of morphine.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.582
- Paul!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.705
- Hold this.
- I got it.

05:15.878 --> 05:19.045
- Paul, come on!
- You'll be all right, okay?

05:22.677 --> 05:24.966
- What do you need?
- Suture kit, needle driver...

05:25.138 --> 05:27.223
- ten of morphine.
- Ten of morphine in the field?

05:27.265 --> 05:29.970
- He could be hypotensive.
- He's not an old lady.

05:30.143 --> 05:33.393
He's in pain. I've given twice
that in the battlefield. Come on.

05:39.152 --> 05:42.900
I need to stop this before it bleeds out.
Tell the pilot to start the chopper.

05:43.072 --> 05:45.610
We're out of here in five.
Hey, keep your head down.

05:46.826 --> 05:48.783
Hold still, you're gonna be okay.

05:48.953 --> 05:51.278
Hey, wait, we haven't even found
his hand yet.

05:51.456 --> 05:54.789
If we don't get out of here in five,
he won't need it. He'll be dead.

06:24.447 --> 06:25.906
Hi.

06:26.699 --> 06:28.241
Do you work here?

06:28.743 --> 06:30.736
No. I'm 9 years old.

06:31.371 --> 06:36.246
- You're right. Silly question.
- I don't feel good. My head hurts.

06:37.043 --> 06:39.119
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

06:39.462 --> 06:41.538
You're in the right place.
Where's your mom?

06:42.090 --> 06:43.548
She died.

06:45.051 --> 06:47.423
- And your dad?
- He's at the refinery.

06:48.388 --> 06:50.214
- How'd you get here?
- I took the bus.

06:51.224 --> 06:54.094
The 93 Express to the
Transit Centre, then the 100.

06:54.268 --> 06:57.519
- That's pretty impressive.
- Not really. I mean, it's all online.

06:59.607 --> 07:02.810
That...
Yeah, of course.

07:03.569 --> 07:05.313
- What's your name?
- Kylie.

07:05.488 --> 07:06.567
Kylie, I'm Topher.

07:07.532 --> 07:10.449
Let's call your dad.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.872
Your sutures are too far apart.

07:23.756 --> 07:26.294
Maybe if you weren't staring
over my shoulder...

07:27.260 --> 07:31.008
- Is everything okay here?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

07:31.764 --> 07:33.971
I'll be right back. Can we talk?

07:34.142 --> 07:35.184
Sure.

07:38.187 --> 07:40.394
You mind laying off
in front of the patient?

07:40.732 --> 07:42.107
Do I mind laying off?

07:42.734 --> 07:44.607
That ever work
with your drill sergeant?

07:44.777 --> 07:47.695
- You're my drill sergeant now?
- No, but I am your boss.

07:47.864 --> 07:50.189
You should've stitched that guy
ten minutes ago.

07:50.450 --> 07:55.028
A two layer closure on a facial lac,
that's first year stuff. Get it done.

08:01.878 --> 08:05.294
- Hey, Krista. Can you...?
- Hey. Yeah, what's up?

08:05.465 --> 08:06.840
I messed up my hand.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.341
I think I did more damage here...

08:09.510 --> 08:12.001
- than I did during the fight.
- You need an x-ray.

08:12.180 --> 08:14.967
I know what it's gonna say:
Hairline metacarpal fracture.

08:15.141 --> 08:19.435
I need a splint, but Jordan can't know
because she'll kill me. I need your help.

08:20.146 --> 08:22.898
Can you stick with me
and help me on my cases?

08:23.066 --> 08:24.108
Yeah.

08:24.817 --> 08:26.312
- Help me with this guy.
- Okay.

08:35.828 --> 08:38.948
Tell them to get out of our airspace
so we can get out of here!

08:47.215 --> 08:48.460
At two o'clock!

08:52.095 --> 08:55.131
We're under fire from everywhere.
I could use some help.

08:55.306 --> 08:58.889
So could I. But it ain't coming, bro.
It's all on us!

08:59.602 --> 09:00.645
<i>TC.</i>

09:01.270 --> 09:05.268
- TC, we're good to go, come on.
- All right, let's get out of here.

09:12.699 --> 09:15.699
- So Scott's in town for the weekend?
- He is.

09:15.868 --> 09:18.359
Ragosa's wining and dining him.
He wants him here...

09:18.538 --> 09:20.198
to run the trauma department.

09:20.623 --> 09:22.532
How do you feel about that?
That's big.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.602
I just wanna make sure
that it's the right step.

09:24.627 --> 09:28.043
You know, I followed TC down here
after he was discharged...

09:28.214 --> 09:31.464
and I just wanna take things slowly.

09:32.927 --> 09:36.711
Which reminds me,
I promised I would ask.

09:36.889 --> 09:39.760
- Scott's best friend, Todd. Hear me out.
- Oh, God.

09:39.934 --> 09:41.808
Look, he's really nice.

09:41.978 --> 09:45.762
He's a vascular surgeon here at
the hospital and he's seen you around.

09:46.774 --> 09:48.850
Wait, you're not seeing anyone,
are you?

09:50.111 --> 09:52.602
- No, I'm not. But...
- Okay, great, just meet him.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.572
I promise, it'll be painless.

09:54.741 --> 09:57.113
We're all going to brunch
and you know what?

09:57.285 --> 10:01.033
If you don't like him, you can kick me
under the table and we'll ditch him.

10:02.331 --> 10:04.454
- Okay.
- Good.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.002
- That hurt.
- Okay.

10:09.172 --> 10:11.497
Not gonna shine a light
in your eyes anymore.

10:11.674 --> 10:15.043
My head hurts all over.
You think it's a migraine?

10:15.345 --> 10:16.969
My dad has them.

10:17.805 --> 10:20.177
- Topher.
- Oh, speaking of whom.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.591
- Daddy!
- You had the sitter worried sick, babe.

10:22.769 --> 10:24.263
You can't just take off.

10:25.063 --> 10:27.055
I'm sorry.

10:28.274 --> 10:29.389
What's wrong with her?

10:29.567 --> 10:31.856
Complaining of headaches,
it's probably nothing.

10:32.028 --> 10:33.688
But I do wanna get an MRI.

10:33.863 --> 10:35.939
All right,
how long is that gonna take?

10:36.115 --> 10:37.396
How...?

10:38.826 --> 10:40.368
Can we?

10:48.336 --> 10:49.878
Is everything okay?

10:50.046 --> 10:52.916
Yeah, what's an MRI gonna run me?

10:53.091 --> 10:55.332
I don't think cost
should be an issue here.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.965
She has a headache,
light sensitivity, nausea.

10:58.137 --> 11:01.304
These are possible signs
of increased intracranial pressure.

11:01.724 --> 11:03.931
Look, I know my kid, all right?

11:04.102 --> 11:06.343
- This is for attention.
- I don't think it is.

11:06.521 --> 11:08.976
- She took two buses on her own...
- Save the lecture.

11:09.148 --> 11:12.268
I know I look like the world's
worst father right now, okay?

11:12.735 --> 11:14.064
Just run your tests.

11:14.237 --> 11:15.897
Just make sure she's okay.

11:17.865 --> 11:19.905
Twenty-eight-year-old female
versus arrow.

11:20.076 --> 11:23.243
Thirty-eight-year-old man
versus hog with hand amputation.

11:23.413 --> 11:25.556
- I'll take him, you take her.
- Trauma One, Trauma Two.

11:25.581 --> 11:27.208
Her name's Amy,
lung collapsed en route.

11:27.291 --> 11:28.750
No breath sounds on the right.

11:28.918 --> 11:31.539
Amy, I'm Dr. Alexander
and I'm gonna help you, okay?

11:31.713 --> 11:32.911
Hey, Kenny. Page Todd.

11:33.089 --> 11:34.982
He's a vascular surgeon,
we might be able to reattach it.

11:35.008 --> 11:37.463
- But where's the hand?
- Right behind you.

11:45.101 --> 11:48.387
Draw a rainbow.
Kenny, get that hog to radiology.

11:48.563 --> 11:51.896
Call for a forearm x-ray for this guy,
push 50 micrograms of fentanyl.

11:52.275 --> 11:56.569
- My hand. It throbs like a bitch!
- Make it a hundred.

11:58.823 --> 12:01.314
Kenny. Kenny! I need you in here.

12:01.617 --> 12:03.277
Thirty-six French.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.238
- Prep the Thora-Seal.
- I can't breathe.

12:06.414 --> 12:07.873
I know, we're gonna fix that.

12:08.041 --> 12:11.741
I'm gonna insert a tube into your chest
to re-inflate your lung.

12:14.672 --> 12:16.250
I can't breathe.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.796
- It's okay, ma'am. Try to relax.
- Amy?

12:22.972 --> 12:25.463
- You have to stop moving.
- Take deep breaths, okay?

12:25.641 --> 12:27.800
The coughing is normal.

12:28.311 --> 12:30.600
- One of Ativan.
- I can't breathe.

12:30.772 --> 12:31.970
Get it out.

12:33.775 --> 12:35.518
She's haemorrhaging.

12:36.569 --> 12:38.941
She dislodged the clot.
I need to open her up.

12:39.113 --> 12:43.740
Type and cross four units of PRBCs,
give me two units on the rapid infuser.

12:43.910 --> 12:47.243
The hog attacked your husband,
bit off his hand. Now he's stable.

12:47.413 --> 12:49.453
Oh, thank God. Henry, baby?

12:49.624 --> 12:52.541
But we're trying to find the hand
while it's still viable.

12:52.710 --> 12:56.079
- I understand. Can he hear me?
- He's in and out from the pain meds.

12:56.255 --> 12:59.541
But you're welcome to spend
a few minutes with him.

13:00.176 --> 13:03.011
TC, Jordan needs you
in Trauma Two.

13:06.766 --> 13:10.265
She pulled out the arrow. Lost
at least two litres of blood in the chest.

13:10.436 --> 13:11.812
- Suction.
- Forceps.

13:13.773 --> 13:15.766
Can you clamp that up?
I need a dry field.

13:15.942 --> 13:17.317
Will do.

13:18.528 --> 13:20.567
Two-0 Prolene.

13:21.406 --> 13:24.739
- You guys order the AB-neg, neat?
- Yeah, get it on the rapid infuser.

13:30.456 --> 13:32.912
- Sutures are in.
- Yep.

13:33.084 --> 13:35.622
All right, let's see how I did.

13:36.129 --> 13:38.252
Paul, can you release the clamp?

13:42.927 --> 13:44.090
Field's remaining dry.

13:44.971 --> 13:48.091
- BP's coming up.
- Nice job.

13:49.642 --> 13:54.351
- Hey. How's it going?
- Usual crazy. Henry's stable for now.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.479
- How about you?
- Usual crazy.

13:58.484 --> 14:01.853
So pork chopping,
sounds like it was intense.

14:02.030 --> 14:06.158
- Nothing I don't see three times a week.
- The cases, not that environment.

14:06.325 --> 14:08.077
Paul said it was like a war zone
out there.

14:08.202 --> 14:09.661
It was nothing like war.

14:09.829 --> 14:11.703
I'm just concerned about you.

14:11.873 --> 14:13.616
The gunfire, the yelling...

14:13.791 --> 14:15.914
Yelling, huh?

14:16.669 --> 14:19.540
You were doing some yelling
yourself this afternoon.

14:20.298 --> 14:23.003
I'm not trying to treat you.
I'm just checking in.

14:24.886 --> 14:28.219
And you're not nearly as charming
as you think you are.

14:30.099 --> 14:34.014
So this giant tube's gonna
take a picture of your head.

14:34.187 --> 14:36.642
Now it doesn't hurt, but it is noisy.

14:36.814 --> 14:38.439
So, I...

14:38.608 --> 14:41.692
What...? What is...?

14:45.948 --> 14:48.356
These should help with that.

14:52.163 --> 14:54.405
I'm gonna strap you in, okay?

14:55.083 --> 14:58.368
Now, I like to pretend...

14:58.544 --> 15:02.589
I'm in a rocket ship
going out into outer space.

15:03.091 --> 15:05.416
Space is a cold vacuum.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.880
Yes, I guess it is.

15:11.057 --> 15:12.884
Hey, remember,
still as a statue, okay?

15:14.811 --> 15:18.429
Daddy, are you gonna
get your picture taken too?

15:18.690 --> 15:19.970
Not today, kiddo.

15:22.276 --> 15:23.901
Okay?

15:24.362 --> 15:27.945
I will be right in the little room
and we can talk through the intercom.

15:31.369 --> 15:34.987
It should take about ten minutes.
Why don't you wait outside?

15:46.759 --> 15:50.839
So just relax and breathe easy, Kylie.
We'll start up in a minute.

15:51.014 --> 15:53.053
Hey, I need the film for the hog.

15:53.224 --> 15:58.431
Hey, what's this I hear about Todd and
Landry going out on a blind date?

15:58.604 --> 16:01.558
- Right. Good one.
- Rumour mill is working overtime on it.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.191
You mean Big Todd?

16:04.485 --> 16:06.359
Rumour has it he has a huge penis.

16:06.821 --> 16:10.107
- Hate to follow that guy.
- I took a peek once in the locker room.

16:10.283 --> 16:11.658
Talk about a hog.

16:12.535 --> 16:16.449
- Like I'm the only one who looks.
- Dwayne, the x-ray.

16:28.676 --> 16:31.630
Where's my dad?
He should be here.

16:31.804 --> 16:35.173
He's right outside, Kylie.
Just hang in there.

16:35.683 --> 16:38.055
You need to help him.

16:38.227 --> 16:39.508
I wanna stop.

16:40.438 --> 16:42.514
I wanna stop!

16:42.857 --> 16:43.972
Turn it off.

16:47.779 --> 16:49.937
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.527
Okay?

16:55.578 --> 16:59.991
I lied. I'm sorry I was faking.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.369
Don't make me go in there again.
Please.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.420
Your arrow patient is crashing.

17:11.594 --> 17:12.839
- Thank God.
- What happened?

17:13.012 --> 17:16.049
She's hypertensive and tachy.
Pulse dropped to 89 percent.

17:16.223 --> 17:19.035
I thought she was bleeding again,
but there's no output in the Thora-Seal.

17:19.060 --> 17:20.339
- Pillow.
- Okay.

17:20.853 --> 17:25.065
Okay, she's wheezing,
her neck is swollen, diffuse urticaria.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.723
She's in anaphylactic shock?
What's she allergic to?

17:28.027 --> 17:30.171
Hundred and twenty-five milligrams
of IV Solu-medrol.

17:30.196 --> 17:32.485
Zero point three milligrams
of epi IM.

17:32.657 --> 17:34.649
What did she get, antibiotics?
Analgesics?

17:34.826 --> 17:36.320
No, nothing.

17:41.457 --> 17:42.951
- It's the blood.
- But AB-neg...

17:43.126 --> 17:45.699
- typed in and cross-matched.
- Stop the transfusion.

17:45.878 --> 17:50.006
Paul, get her phone and call anyone you
can find to give us her medical history.

17:50.174 --> 17:53.626
We need to figure out what blood
to give her before she codes.

17:53.803 --> 17:55.428
His hand is in the hog?

17:55.596 --> 17:58.266
Pretty impressive his buddies
tracked it down.

17:58.433 --> 18:02.300
The vascular surgeon is on his way
in to perform the re-attachment.

18:02.478 --> 18:05.265
- Is this Henry's stuff?
- Yeah.

18:06.441 --> 18:07.639
What the hell she want?

18:08.317 --> 18:12.446
And why the hell are you calling
my husband, you no-good whore?

18:13.573 --> 18:16.823
This is Dr. Cummings from
San Antonio Memorial Hospital.

18:16.993 --> 18:19.947
Well, this is Ginger Brown.
I'm already here with my husband.

18:20.121 --> 18:23.157
So why are you calling
his phone from my sister's?

18:23.332 --> 18:27.282
- Mrs. Brown...
- Is she here? Is Amy here?

18:27.712 --> 18:31.840
Oh, son of a bitch.
Was she hunting with Henry?

18:32.008 --> 18:34.925
Oh, damn you, Henry!
Damn you to hell! You promised!

18:35.094 --> 18:38.344
- A little help in here.
- You promised me. You promised.

18:38.514 --> 18:40.756
Can we talk?

18:40.933 --> 18:43.804
- Hospital stuff or your stuff?
- Just walk with me.

18:43.978 --> 18:48.272
So my wife is going to "allow" me
to see the children over the weekend.

18:48.441 --> 18:50.398
She actually used the word "allow."

18:50.568 --> 18:52.976
God, she just really pisses me off.

18:53.154 --> 18:54.981
Everybody pisses you off.

18:56.949 --> 19:00.733
Let's be clear here. When we talk,
you're not my boss, you're my patient.

19:00.912 --> 19:03.284
I have to speak honestly
or this won't help you.

19:03.456 --> 19:05.532
Yes. You're right.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.582
Please continue.

19:08.002 --> 19:11.620
You have to stop taking everything
someone says as an attack.

19:11.798 --> 19:13.707
- I don't take...
- Your first step...

19:13.883 --> 19:15.792
is to stop being a dick.

19:16.135 --> 19:19.385
- That's your advice? Stop being a...
- Dick. Yes.

19:19.555 --> 19:22.889
I don't see you at home, but I guess
you're a lot like you are here.

19:23.059 --> 19:26.095
And here at work, taking away
the Tailgate was a dick move.

19:26.270 --> 19:30.054
That was a legal issue.
I had no choice.

19:30.233 --> 19:32.060
But you can choose to find a solution.

19:32.318 --> 19:35.604
You can't like having everybody
always pissed at you.

19:35.863 --> 19:37.406
- Comes with the job.
- It doesn't.

19:37.573 --> 19:40.610
You bring that to the job and
you bring it into your home life.

19:40.785 --> 19:42.908
You want people
to start respecting you?

19:43.079 --> 19:45.784
Then you have to learn
to meet them halfway.

19:46.457 --> 19:47.868
Kylie, why would you do that?

19:48.126 --> 19:50.284
Look, she thinks something is wrong
with you.

19:50.461 --> 19:52.253
She didn't wanna say anything
to you.

19:52.422 --> 19:55.625
- So the whole MRI was for nothing?
- I knew you'd be mad.

19:56.217 --> 20:00.297
You almost fell down last night.
You didn't think I saw, but I did.

20:00.471 --> 20:03.176
- You need a doctor.
- Damn it, Kylie.

20:03.349 --> 20:06.220
You don't look great. She says
you've been having headaches?

20:06.394 --> 20:09.311
I'm working doubles all week.
I came down with the flu.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.434
- That's all it is.
- Please, Daddy, I made him promise.

20:12.608 --> 20:13.651
No needles.

20:13.943 --> 20:19.613
Look, I have a daughter, I know
that they can be absolutely annoying.

20:19.782 --> 20:23.282
But they mean well.
We can do a quick workup.

20:23.453 --> 20:25.944
What if it's not the flu?
Better safe than sorry.

20:26.122 --> 20:29.206
Because if I miss the rest of this shift,
I risk losing my job.

20:29.375 --> 20:32.045
Kylie, I'm fine, baby, all right?
I'm not Mom.

20:32.337 --> 20:34.044
I'm sorry she wasted your time.

20:34.213 --> 20:36.502
I gotta get her home
and go back to work.

20:36.674 --> 20:39.379
Please, Daddy, no.
Stop, it won't take long.

20:39.552 --> 20:43.217
I'll do chores for a week.
He wants to help you. Please.

20:43.389 --> 20:46.474
Gotta be something we can do
to bring back the Tailgate.

20:46.642 --> 20:49.513
What if we put up railings?

20:52.398 --> 20:55.933
Made it a smaller,
more contained area?

20:56.527 --> 20:59.564
Yes, yes, I'm aware of that.

21:00.031 --> 21:01.822
Well, there are a few doctors here...

21:01.991 --> 21:04.363
who I wouldn't mind
jumping off the roof.

21:05.286 --> 21:09.154
No, no, no, that's a joke. I...

21:10.541 --> 21:12.664
What a dick.

21:22.136 --> 21:23.251
Damn it.

21:23.429 --> 21:25.422
Why is this thing still inside?

21:25.598 --> 21:28.801
Somebody get it out of here, now!

21:34.107 --> 21:36.977
- Topher, watch out!
- Look out!

21:40.363 --> 21:41.643
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

21:41.823 --> 21:44.610
He's headed towards the loading dock.
Call Animal Control.

21:44.784 --> 21:46.693
We need some tranqs.

21:50.415 --> 21:52.075
God bless Texas.

21:53.501 --> 21:57.451
Help! Topher, help! It's my Dad!

22:00.591 --> 22:04.210
- Get the head, I'll get the shoulders.
- It's gonna be okay, Daddy.

22:04.595 --> 22:08.593
- Steve, you hear me?
- He just fell. Do something, please.

22:08.933 --> 22:11.804
You hear that stridor?
His vocal cords are spasmed shut.

22:11.978 --> 22:14.136
We can't pass an ET tube.
Grab the crike kit.

22:14.313 --> 22:16.686
Hey! Hey, give us light!

22:16.858 --> 22:20.392
You've been dying to do a crike.
This is your shot.

22:20.862 --> 22:23.981
- You'll be okay.
- Let Krista do it.

22:24.407 --> 22:27.692
I would have killed for one as an intern.
You're up.

22:29.245 --> 22:33.788
Seriously?
All right, Krista, you are up.

22:33.958 --> 22:36.627
I'll walk you through it.
Just you got to extend...

22:36.794 --> 22:39.665
The neck and palpate for the laryngeal
prominence. I got it.

22:42.175 --> 22:46.042
- They'll take care of you, Daddy.
- Okay, now you make a vertical incision.

22:46.971 --> 22:49.213
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be all right.

22:49.390 --> 22:50.801
Okay, palpate again.

22:52.518 --> 22:55.638
Now you make a horizontal
incision along the cricoid membrane.

22:56.522 --> 22:58.147
You got this, Krista.

23:00.234 --> 23:02.808
Lift and stabilise the larynx.

23:03.446 --> 23:05.735
Insert the tube.

23:05.907 --> 23:08.398
- You have to save him.
- We will. Don't worry.

23:14.832 --> 23:16.908
Let's get him inside.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.875
- Okay. It's gonna be on your count.
- Okay. One, two, three.

23:25.718 --> 23:27.212
Let's get him inside.

23:32.475 --> 23:36.804
I told you something was wrong
with him, but you didn't believe me!

23:36.979 --> 23:39.138
You have to do something!
Save him.

23:39.315 --> 23:43.776
Okay. I'm gonna do my best, Kylie,
okay? I promise.

23:50.702 --> 23:51.864
He's having pauses.

23:52.036 --> 23:54.823
Order a chest x-ray, an EKG,
and a chem-20.

23:55.123 --> 23:56.165
He's got papilledema.

23:56.916 --> 23:59.537
- Brain bleed from a head trauma?
- Maybe, maybe.

23:59.711 --> 24:01.834
Add a head CT and a tox screen.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.962
- Where are his labs?
- Mass spec's down...

24:04.132 --> 24:05.626
and the ER lab is backed up.

24:05.842 --> 24:07.881
Why does everything break at night?

24:08.886 --> 24:11.674
- Whoa, chemical burn.
- That's probably an acid exposure.

24:11.848 --> 24:15.762
Everybody back. Gloves off. Switch to
neoprene. Get his clothes out of here.

24:15.935 --> 24:17.726
What kind of acid...?

24:17.895 --> 24:20.184
Who knows without blood work?
Check Poison Control.

24:20.356 --> 24:23.725
Set me up for a high volume irrigation
and grab me some Silvadene.

24:23.901 --> 24:25.016
The flu, my ass.

24:25.903 --> 24:28.904
I need morphine, stat.

24:29.073 --> 24:32.941
- Give me a thousand CCs of anything.
- Yeah, no, I'll get right on that.

24:33.119 --> 24:36.120
- Let's get that abscess drained.
- I hear you passed up a crike.

24:36.664 --> 24:37.993
Have a seat.

24:38.166 --> 24:41.665
Are you really that into Krista
or is it something else?

24:42.420 --> 24:44.792
Unbelievable. You're injured.

24:45.340 --> 24:47.831
Do you have any idea
how much trouble...

24:48.009 --> 24:50.926
- we could both be in?
- Can I get that morphine?

24:53.097 --> 24:55.469
- It's not that...
- You're on cold and flu duty...

24:55.641 --> 24:58.642
until further notice.
Get that splinted after your shift.

25:00.646 --> 25:02.853
I think she means business.

25:04.984 --> 25:06.063
Why?

25:06.569 --> 25:08.028
Why does she have to do this?

25:08.196 --> 25:12.359
Of all the men in the world, why does
she have to cheat with my husband?

25:12.533 --> 25:15.203
- I know this is hard for you...
- Henry's all I have.

25:15.370 --> 25:17.943
Now, Amy, she can have any guy
she wants...

25:18.122 --> 25:21.871
- always could, our whole lives.
- Yeah, that sucks.

25:22.043 --> 25:27.382
Okay, it really does, and I'm sorry,
but your sister is very sick.

25:28.341 --> 25:32.837
Good. God finally decided
to even things up a bit.

25:33.429 --> 25:37.842
This isn't the first time she and Henry...
But he promised me.

25:38.017 --> 25:39.761
Does she have any allergies...

25:39.936 --> 25:43.554
- or pre-existing conditions?
- She always had something going on.

25:43.731 --> 25:46.851
- Whatever got her more attention.
- Was she ever transfused blood?

25:47.026 --> 25:50.146
She had a wreck in high school.
Had to have surgery.

25:50.321 --> 25:52.148
There were all kinds
of complications.

25:52.323 --> 25:56.273
I mean, you should've seen her
sitting in her bed for months...

25:56.452 --> 25:57.911
like a princess on a pea.

25:58.079 --> 26:01.115
She's alloimmunised
against minor blood antigens.

26:02.208 --> 26:05.162
- What's that mean?
- It means your sister is allergic...

26:05.336 --> 26:06.581
to our blood bank.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.629
She needs very specific blood
lacking the same antigens as hers.

26:13.594 --> 26:15.920
- Like yours.
- Or she'll die.

26:16.097 --> 26:18.635
Oh, so she finally needs
something from me?

26:21.269 --> 26:24.768
All that girl does is take
and take and take and take.

26:27.275 --> 26:30.145
Well, all the pain she's caused me...

26:30.820 --> 26:32.896
I'm done giving.

26:34.657 --> 26:35.736
She's on her own.

26:39.996 --> 26:43.412
Her sister refuses to give blood.
There's a lot of anger there.

26:43.750 --> 26:46.288
How long can Amy hold out
without the transfusion?

26:46.461 --> 26:49.415
A couple hours. She's on pressors,
but it's delaying the inevitable.

26:49.589 --> 26:52.506
Well, you can't just force her
to give blood.

26:53.009 --> 26:55.678
Let me check with the lawyers
and see what I can do.

26:56.679 --> 26:58.055
You could just force her.

26:58.264 --> 27:01.384
We could just knock her out
and take her blood.

27:01.559 --> 27:04.015
How about we stick
with the legal option first?

27:05.688 --> 27:07.597
I liked your idea.

27:08.441 --> 27:11.940
- Oh, isn't that your date?
- Jordan roped me in.

27:12.153 --> 27:15.652
- You don't have to apologise.
- Yeah, I wasn't apologising.

27:15.823 --> 27:18.065
- Hey, TC.
- Hey, Big Todd.

27:18.993 --> 27:24.118
- Nurses been talking about me again?
- Dwayne from radiology, huge fan.

27:25.917 --> 27:28.123
Landry, right? I'm Todd.

27:28.294 --> 27:30.666
- Believe we have a date.
- Looking forward to it.

27:30.838 --> 27:33.127
So here it is.

27:33.299 --> 27:35.968
What the hell?
You called me in for that?

27:36.135 --> 27:37.795
You need a butcher, not a surgeon.

27:37.970 --> 27:40.212
Paul, the hand.

27:43.226 --> 27:46.761
Never in my life did I think
I'd be assisting on a hog surgery.

27:46.938 --> 27:50.354
- All you have to do is reattach.
- If it's still viable.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.767
Lot of work to keep that thing alive.
You do know they're pests, right?

27:56.322 --> 27:58.896
- Don't talk about Bruce that way.
- Bruce?

27:59.075 --> 28:01.648
Yeah, damn right.
Bruce is a survivor.

28:01.828 --> 28:04.532
He's been shot, presumed dead,
shot at again...

28:04.706 --> 28:06.532
You ever been shot at, Big Todd?

28:07.041 --> 28:08.749
- No.
- No. That's right.

28:09.335 --> 28:11.292
Because you didn't serve.

28:12.380 --> 28:14.953
But, hey, call me if there's a problem.

28:16.342 --> 28:17.801
Enjoy your day.

28:24.642 --> 28:26.302
Poison Control says oil workers...

28:26.477 --> 28:28.933
- can work around sulfuric acid.
- It's not that.

28:29.105 --> 28:31.774
It's not sulfuric.
Phosphoric?

28:32.275 --> 28:34.600
That doesn't explain
the other symptoms.

28:34.777 --> 28:39.024
Near syncope, tingling,
arrhythmias, and laryngospasms.

28:39.490 --> 28:41.483
Hydrofluoric acid?

28:45.747 --> 28:48.997
- What are you doing?
- It's a poor man's chem-20.

28:49.167 --> 28:51.539
Watch his hand, Krista.
Watch his hand.

28:52.420 --> 28:53.831
Son of a bitch.

28:54.005 --> 28:56.710
- Thank you.
- Push two amps of calcium chloride now.

28:56.883 --> 29:00.216
- He's hypocalcaemic? You sure?
- See that movement? Trousseau's sign.

29:00.386 --> 29:01.845
Tell-tale for hypocalcaemia.

29:02.096 --> 29:05.181
A hydrofluoric acid burn leaches
the body's calcium.

29:05.475 --> 29:07.384
Now, if the solution was diluted...

29:07.560 --> 29:10.644
Then it would take a few days
for the symptoms to start to show.

29:10.813 --> 29:14.017
Kylie was right.
She watched him deteriorate.

29:14.776 --> 29:16.602
Let's get compresses on the burns...

29:16.778 --> 29:19.399
and ice water solution
of Zephiran Chloride.

29:20.490 --> 29:21.735
All right, brother.

29:22.617 --> 29:27.409
Look, I am running out of ways
to convince you.

29:28.623 --> 29:31.244
You are not thinking this
all the way through.

29:32.418 --> 29:34.375
She did this to herself.

29:34.921 --> 29:37.376
Now, I am done
listening to you people.

29:37.548 --> 29:40.715
I am not changing my mind.

29:40.885 --> 29:42.759
You're her last chance.

29:43.680 --> 29:47.298
Now, Amy will die if you
do not give her your blood.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.396
I hope she does.

29:52.980 --> 29:56.147
I'm not doing it and that's final.

29:59.070 --> 30:01.063
EPO injection is in.

30:02.323 --> 30:04.897
It isn't enough to keep her alive
without the blood.

30:05.076 --> 30:06.950
Bolus a thousand milligrams
of IV iron.

30:07.578 --> 30:08.907
I got the blood.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.653
- Why is she sedated?
- You don't wanna know.

30:16.462 --> 30:17.505
Connection's set.

30:18.881 --> 30:19.961
She needs volume now.

30:20.133 --> 30:22.837
We can actually transfuse directly
from person to person?

30:23.011 --> 30:26.426
Yep. Buddy transfusion.
Did it all the time in combat.

30:26.597 --> 30:29.682
You just sedated her.
This is so beyond the rules.

30:29.851 --> 30:32.057
- I mean, TC, if...
- Listen, this is all on me.

30:32.228 --> 30:36.522
I couldn't let her die. You shouldn't
even be here. You got too much to lose.

30:39.193 --> 30:42.147
Well, so does Amy.
Open her up, let's do this.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.038
Get down! Get down!

30:52.832 --> 30:56.166
- Is he gonna make it?
- No. Pete's dead.

30:56.336 --> 31:00.582
I'm doing compressions to pump
the blood from his body into Boomer's.

31:00.757 --> 31:02.548
I had to do what I had to do, right?

31:03.301 --> 31:06.337
Yeah, you saved him, TC.
You saved him.

31:06.512 --> 31:10.047
Pulse is strong.
BP's up to 105 systolic.

31:10.224 --> 31:11.719
Her colour's coming back too.

31:11.893 --> 31:14.265
Let's recheck her CBCs
and see where we are.

31:14.896 --> 31:16.390
Way to go, TC.

31:18.024 --> 31:19.186
Yeah.

31:24.655 --> 31:29.994
Your dad has a tube in his neck
and that helps him to breathe.

31:30.453 --> 31:35.079
And he's gonna be okay,
all because of what you did.

31:37.752 --> 31:41.999
I'm sorry I hit you. I was so scared.

31:42.757 --> 31:44.750
I was too.

31:45.176 --> 31:49.589
But I had a promise to keep, right?

31:50.223 --> 31:52.132
Anyway, you hit like a girl.

31:52.850 --> 31:55.092
Good. Girls rule.

31:56.896 --> 31:57.939
Okay.

31:58.106 --> 31:59.766
- Ready?
- Yes.

32:25.967 --> 32:27.544
Hey, can I talk to Lynn?

32:28.469 --> 32:32.218
I know she's sleeping,
she's always sleeping.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.808
Hey.

32:36.728 --> 32:38.685
Yeah, I know it's early, honey.

32:38.855 --> 32:40.563
But...

32:42.191 --> 32:45.856
I just wanted...
I just wanted to hear your voice.

32:50.825 --> 32:56.994
No, no, I didn't huff nitrous
on my shift but that's a good idea.

32:57.498 --> 33:00.499
No, but it's probably better
that Jordan found out than Ragosa.

33:00.668 --> 33:03.954
Yeah, plus now people won't think
I wimped out on the crike.

33:04.797 --> 33:07.371
I don't think anyone thinks
you're a wimp.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.958
Here, let's see
if we can get the swelling down.

33:10.136 --> 33:12.129
It's just weird
having Jordan as the boss.

33:12.305 --> 33:16.634
We're friends and so we're just trying
to find out where we draw the line.

33:16.809 --> 33:18.719
- It's all very weird.
- Well, I mean...

33:18.895 --> 33:21.220
drawing the line
with work friends is...

33:21.481 --> 33:22.523
It's hard.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.144
You know...

33:26.569 --> 33:29.025
I never properly congratulated you...

33:30.406 --> 33:32.648
on your victory.

33:39.207 --> 33:41.532
Hey, don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

33:41.709 --> 33:42.907
It's not that.

33:43.503 --> 33:45.163
Then what...?

33:46.130 --> 33:48.123
Are you gay or something?

33:52.637 --> 33:55.044
Oh, God. You're gay?

33:58.393 --> 34:00.848
I'm gonna sue you,
I'm gonna sue this hospital.

34:01.020 --> 34:02.479
You think I give a crap?

34:03.398 --> 34:05.022
Your sister was dying.

34:05.191 --> 34:08.393
And you might not care now,
but I promise you, in a day...

34:08.569 --> 34:11.190
a week or month,
you would have cared.

34:12.699 --> 34:16.364
And trust me, you don't wanna spend
the rest of your life knowing that...

34:16.536 --> 34:19.027
you let someone die
that you could have saved.

34:19.956 --> 34:23.788
Sometimes you do
what you have to do.

34:25.962 --> 34:28.333
They just hurt me so damn much.

34:29.882 --> 34:31.542
I know they did.

34:33.761 --> 34:34.840
I'm sorry.

34:36.639 --> 34:41.016
If you still wanna see your husband
or your sister, they're in recovery.

34:47.065 --> 34:49.984
I don't get it. Because
Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell is already gone.

34:50.152 --> 34:52.643
I've been to two gay weddings
in the past six months.

34:52.822 --> 34:55.942
Okay, were either of them
military or in Texas?

34:56.367 --> 34:58.443
Just coming out changes things.

34:58.828 --> 35:02.279
Here, in my unit, in the cage...

35:05.251 --> 35:08.335
I'm not the only one
that I'm protecting either.

35:08.504 --> 35:09.785
I got...

35:10.048 --> 35:13.167
a boyfriend, Rick, over there.

35:13.551 --> 35:18.379
And Afghanistan, that's not the place
you really wanna come out.

35:19.432 --> 35:20.891
Okay.

35:21.059 --> 35:22.601
Well, I...

35:22.935 --> 35:24.098
I get it now.

35:25.146 --> 35:28.597
And don't worry,
your secret is safe with me, okay?

35:29.984 --> 35:32.606
I know, that's why I told you.

35:33.321 --> 35:39.110
All right, listen up, everybody.
I have some great news.

35:39.285 --> 35:41.194
The Tailgate is back.

35:42.622 --> 35:47.035
And even better. We are rebuilding it
in a corner of the parking lot...

35:47.210 --> 35:50.661
so that you're closer to the ER
and don't have to walk up the stairs.

35:51.381 --> 35:52.460
Thank you.

35:53.174 --> 35:54.253
That's awesome.

35:54.467 --> 35:58.928
In exchange, you have to give up one
of your 15-minute breaks each shift...

35:59.097 --> 36:02.263
as well as limit the time
you can spend there after work.

36:02.433 --> 36:03.809
That's just evil.

36:03.976 --> 36:06.894
After all,
we are footing the electric bill.

36:07.146 --> 36:10.432
The cost of doing business, so...

36:10.858 --> 36:12.483
enjoy.

36:12.902 --> 36:15.227
Way to snatch defeat
from the jaws of victory.

36:15.405 --> 36:19.402
What? I met them halfway.
But nothing's free.

36:19.575 --> 36:22.660
Now they respect me
because I didn't cave.

36:22.995 --> 36:24.655
You know...

36:24.831 --> 36:27.369
you could learn
some things from me too.

36:28.418 --> 36:31.621
- We have a lot of work to do.
- Right.

36:32.171 --> 36:34.378
I'll be in my office.

36:58.865 --> 37:01.901
- Have you seen Krista?
- Oh, dude, you gotta let that one go.

37:02.702 --> 37:06.652
Hey, do me a favour,
send Krista for Resusci Annie.

37:08.332 --> 37:09.791
If I don't strike back now...

37:09.959 --> 37:12.995
I'll be a walking punchline
for the rest of the year. Yes?

37:13.171 --> 37:15.792
- Okay.
- Thank you, thank you, okay.

37:17.717 --> 37:21.584
- So where's he off to?
- To get you with the Resusci Annie gag.

37:21.763 --> 37:23.802
He really was home-schooled,
wasn't he?

37:23.973 --> 37:25.016
You know what?

37:25.183 --> 37:28.717
Get your camera ready,
because there's going to be tears.

37:33.733 --> 37:36.224
Pretty ballsy move you pulled off
there with Ginger.

37:36.402 --> 37:39.605
Yeah, I'm not big on
letting my patients die.

37:42.450 --> 37:47.112
So, what's the deal with the dress?
You going to the prom or something?

37:47.288 --> 37:50.704
I've got my niece's confirmation
after my brunch with Big Todd.

37:52.210 --> 37:54.452
Would you like to see
what I did on my prom?

38:17.652 --> 38:22.148
Look, I'm sorry I lied. It's just,
I know you don't like the fighting.

38:22.323 --> 38:25.360
It's not that.
I hate that you'd risk your future.

38:26.744 --> 38:28.618
You could be great, Drew.

38:28.788 --> 38:33.497
But as your boss and, well,
more importantly as your friend...

38:33.668 --> 38:35.660
I'd hate to see fighting ruin that.

38:35.837 --> 38:38.458
Yeah, but it's not just
about punching someone.

38:38.965 --> 38:44.090
It's a group of vets and
we train together, talk about things.

38:44.262 --> 38:46.967
It's like the brotherhood
that I had over there.

38:47.974 --> 38:49.136
It's therapy.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.223
I didn't know that.

38:53.521 --> 38:57.186
So, okay, no more full-on bouts.

38:57.775 --> 38:59.851
But I can't stop training.

39:00.028 --> 39:01.688
I need it.

39:01.863 --> 39:04.151
And I won't ever lie you to again.

39:04.449 --> 39:08.031
Good. Because I know everything
that goes on in this place.

39:08.661 --> 39:10.737
It's my job to know all.

39:14.959 --> 39:17.082
Do you think
Big Todd will like the dress?

39:17.253 --> 39:19.709
I don't think it's his size.

39:21.174 --> 39:23.878
So you still going to brunch?

39:24.427 --> 39:27.796
- More for Jordan than Todd.
- Oh, interesting.

39:27.972 --> 39:29.929
You wish.

39:31.142 --> 39:33.514
- I don't have any girlfriends.
- No?

39:33.686 --> 39:35.513
Me neither.

39:36.647 --> 39:38.058
It's okay. I locked the door.

39:40.109 --> 39:43.525
- It's locked, are you sure he's in here?
- Maybe he's in another room.

39:45.281 --> 39:47.072
I'm meeting Drew, I gotta go.

39:47.241 --> 39:49.993
I'm sure he'll figure out
I'm not coming eventually.

39:50.370 --> 39:53.240
Or he'll be there
when our next shift starts.

39:53.790 --> 39:57.289
- Have a good one.
- You too.
