00:00.789 --> 00:04.320
Alice is dead. Initial reports
suggest she started the fire.

00:04.491 --> 00:05.632
She killed herself.

00:05.736 --> 00:08.366
The DNA results are back on
the remains in the shed.

00:08.452 --> 00:12.741
We ran them against your husband.
It's a confirmed match with your daughter.

00:14.644 --> 00:16.553
It's really Alice?

00:16.578 --> 00:17.937
I'm sorry.

00:17.962 --> 00:19.401
She asked me.

00:19.426 --> 00:20.815
She begged me.

00:20.830 --> 00:23.229
It's not Matthew's fault
that this happened.

00:23.230 --> 00:24.879
He knows what he's done.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.449
You both do.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.649
Who is this man.
Henry Reed?

00:29.650 --> 00:33.679
Why did she need to see him
before she took her own life?

00:33.680 --> 00:36.829
Henry Reed made those
payments out of guilt

00:36.830 --> 00:38.889
for what they did to my sister.

00:38.890 --> 00:41.549
Henry Reed and his army friend.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.519
A man called "Stone".

00:43.520 --> 00:45.443
She always wanted a family.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.359
It hit her hard, you know?

00:50.360 --> 00:53.179
Why can't you just
leave us alone?! Calm down.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.442
Oh!

00:58.560 --> 01:00.479
You know what I said, earlier on,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.920
about not seeing something
that's right in front of you?

01:02.921 --> 01:04.369
Well, I was right.

01:04.370 --> 01:06.326
There was another girl.

01:19.161 --> 01:21.243
Hey! Hey!

01:32.400 --> 01:34.009
Hey!

01:34.010 --> 01:35.389
Sorry.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.529
English, yeah? Yeah.
What do you want?

01:38.530 --> 01:39.829
This...

01:39.830 --> 01:41.092
You left it at the cafe.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.910
Thank you.

01:43.911 --> 01:45.199
I'm sorry for earlier.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.729
I talk too much when I'm nervous.

01:46.730 --> 01:49.910
Some people fall silent, some go
red, some will sweat - I talk.

01:49.911 --> 01:51.599
It's completely foolish, of course.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.809
What is there to be nervous of?

01:53.810 --> 01:56.889
Just talking to another person...

01:56.890 --> 01:58.835
I'm doing it all over again. Sorry.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.377
Thanks for this.

04:21.959 --> 04:25.809
♪ Oh, my love

04:25.810 --> 04:29.279
♪ We pray each day

04:29.280 --> 04:32.920

04:32.921 --> 04:35.287

05:06.760 --> 05:09.839
Ja, ich verstehe.
Ja, vielen dank.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.920
Ja, auf wiedersehen.

05:11.921 --> 05:14.989
The desk NCO says Sergeant
Stone is not available.

05:14.990 --> 05:16.537
A medical issue, they said.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.689
I hope everything
is OK with the baby.

05:20.690 --> 05:23.089
They did not disclose any more.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.849
I feel we should at least
talk to her, it's her case.

05:26.850 --> 05:29.119
Well, if you wish to see her,
I understand, of course.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.479
No.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.050
No, it's not that. It's just...

05:33.051 --> 05:35.053
Forgive me. Pretend I didn't say it.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.729
Well, we're almost there.

05:56.610 --> 05:59.409
Henry Reed's body was found here.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.689
One shot, into his mouth.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.100
The gun in his right hand.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.699
Forensics all supported
Sergeant Stone's conclusion.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.479
He killed himself.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.924
But no indication of why.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.930
Sometimes, there are not.

06:14.931 --> 06:16.171
Sometimes...

06:20.280 --> 06:21.839
What are you thinking?

06:21.840 --> 06:24.619
A British Army officer
kills himself.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.399
A few days later, an English girl,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.539
Iong thought missing, returns.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.569
She goes to the grave
of the Army officer

06:30.570 --> 06:33.559
before she sets herself on fire.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.630
Do you believe in coincidence, Jorn?

06:37.700 --> 06:41.129
"Coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

06:41.130 --> 06:43.050
A policeman who quotes Einstein.

06:43.051 --> 06:44.339
You're a rare breed.

06:44.340 --> 06:47.170
Well, if there's a connection,
I cannot imagine what it could be.

06:47.171 --> 06:48.319
Henry Reed.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.689
Does he have any family?

06:49.690 --> 06:51.359
Any loved ones in Germany?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.609
His son.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.489
He's a trooper on the base.

06:54.490 --> 06:55.899
Daniel Reed.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.769
Well, I think, perhaps,
in the morning,

06:57.770 --> 06:59.613
we should talk to Daniel Reed.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.570
So, your notes say you
have placenta praevia...

07:06.840 --> 07:08.205
..and, yes, I can see...

07:09.690 --> 07:11.779
..the placenta is
very low in the womb.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.279
With this condition,

07:13.280 --> 07:14.769
some vaginal bleeding

07:14.770 --> 07:16.289
can sometimes occur.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.289
But do you think it was
the fall that caused it?

07:18.290 --> 07:20.050
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

07:20.051 --> 07:23.529
But still, I'd like
to keep you in overnight.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.129
Are you worried about the baby?

07:25.130 --> 07:26.539
No.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.009
Not worried.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.209
Only...

07:29.210 --> 07:32.180
the baby's heart rate is a little
faster than I would like,

07:32.181 --> 07:33.649
so we'll keep you on the monitor

07:33.650 --> 07:35.499
to see if the girl settles down,

07:35.500 --> 07:36.649
OK?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.169
Good morning.

08:00.170 --> 08:03.619
Looks like we are going to
spend Christmas Eve together.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.690
And here I am, with
nothing to give you.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.731
Daniel Reed hasn't
reported in for duty.

08:16.450 --> 08:18.649
Hallo? Marlene Loweich?

08:18.650 --> 08:19.930
Ja. Ja, Polizei.

08:19.931 --> 08:22.050
Wir wurden gerne mit ihnen
uber Daniel Reed sprechen.

08:22.051 --> 08:23.079
Ja.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.854
Danke.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.899
Guten morgen.
Durfen wir hereinkommen?

08:36.900 --> 08:38.015
Ja.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.139
Wow.

08:47.140 --> 08:49.209
Wow, it smells wonderful.

08:49.210 --> 08:51.079
I'm training to become a chef.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.139
You certainly have enough
saucepans to qualify.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.729
What is this about?

08:56.730 --> 08:58.539
Daniel Reed.

08:58.540 --> 08:59.899
He's your boyfriend, no?

08:59.900 --> 09:01.339
Yes.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.340
Well, he was...

09:03.850 --> 09:06.699
..until yesterday morning, anyway.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.409
What happened yesterday morning?

09:08.410 --> 09:10.769
I woke up and he was gone.

09:10.770 --> 09:11.969
Just like that.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.689
Did he say why?

09:13.690 --> 09:15.009
These last few months,

09:15.010 --> 09:16.529
even before his father died,

09:16.530 --> 09:18.979
Daniel was very distant.

09:18.980 --> 09:23.050
And then, when Henry
took his own life, he...

09:23.051 --> 09:24.619
he fell further.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.570
Oh, scheisse.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.849
Another failure.

09:37.850 --> 09:40.419
No, it will only be a
failure if you stop trying.

09:40.420 --> 09:42.889
Right now, it's experience.

09:42.890 --> 09:46.519
Daniel started to think that
his father did not kill himself.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.930
He became paranoid.

09:48.931 --> 09:51.445
He started to talk about Iraq.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.649
He became obsessed with it,

09:54.650 --> 09:58.060
with this period that his
father's life spent there.

09:58.061 --> 09:59.449
What happened there?

09:59.450 --> 10:01.569
I don't know, he doesn't know,

10:01.570 --> 10:04.009
but it seemed very important to him.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.729
Did he ever mention Alice Webster

10:05.730 --> 10:08.339
or perhaps a girl
called Sophie Giroux?

10:08.340 --> 10:09.769
No.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.930
No. What could Daniel
have had to do with them?

10:11.931 --> 10:13.649
Well, we don't know.

10:13.650 --> 10:17.169
We are as in the dark as
you are right now, but...

10:17.170 --> 10:19.369
if you think of anything,

10:19.370 --> 10:20.709
anything at all,

10:20.710 --> 10:21.889
any news of Daniel,

10:21.890 --> 10:24.619
if you hear from him, please...

10:24.620 --> 10:25.814
call me any time.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.529
Wherever the hell he has gone,

10:28.530 --> 10:30.419
they can have him.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.069
It's their problem now.

11:14.770 --> 11:15.979
Hello?

11:20.380 --> 11:21.719
How are you?

11:21.720 --> 11:22.800
I'm fine, but...

11:24.380 --> 11:25.930
I'm tired.

11:25.931 --> 11:27.080
It was a long flight.

11:29.170 --> 11:30.740
I'm back in Germany.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.889
OK.

11:34.890 --> 11:36.529
Enough, Julien.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.772
This is enough.

11:37.797 --> 11:38.804
You're ill.

11:38.829 --> 11:40.467
You have a tumour.

11:40.506 --> 11:41.875
You have to understand that,

11:41.900 --> 11:43.499
if you do nothing,

11:43.500 --> 11:44.940
you will die.

11:44.941 --> 11:46.738
That's the choice you're making.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.989
I have to be here.

11:49.990 --> 11:51.369
Why?

11:51.370 --> 11:52.979
Why can't somebody else do it?

11:52.980 --> 11:55.409
Why can't you just let it bloody go?

11:55.410 --> 11:56.456
Celia...

12:30.420 --> 12:32.249
That is Alice's necklace.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.139
With the bird, I recognise it.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.419
We found it in the shed,

12:35.420 --> 12:37.149
after your daughter...

12:39.370 --> 12:40.779
It doesn't mean it's the same one.

12:40.780 --> 12:42.699
Alice was wearing it
when she went missing.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.139
That third girl, maybe she...?

12:44.140 --> 12:47.259
Forward me the photo
and I'll look into it.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.930
What will you do?

12:48.931 --> 12:51.810
I promise, Gemma, I'll do
everything I can to find out...

12:51.811 --> 12:53.017
who this girl is.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.535
Me and Sam, it...

13:00.610 --> 13:03.070
Me and Sam,

13:03.071 --> 13:04.345
it's over.

13:06.330 --> 13:07.945
We both knew it wasn't right.

13:10.071 --> 13:12.062
I think, maybe...

13:13.660 --> 13:17.810
Maybe if you talked
to him, about Alice...

13:17.811 --> 13:20.149
Have you showed him this picture?

13:20.150 --> 13:21.419
Oh, no.

13:21.420 --> 13:22.869
It's not my place. No.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.189
No, it's not.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.233
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.289
Eve.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.279
Nice to see you.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.851
Gemma Webster says you've been
helping her out with something.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.139
She thinks that girl...

14:02.140 --> 14:03.670
is her real daughter,

14:03.671 --> 14:05.199
that she's Alice.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.839
And Mrs Webster thinks that

14:06.840 --> 14:08.080
this girl, at the back...

14:09.671 --> 14:11.627
..she's wearing Alice's necklace.

14:14.210 --> 14:15.670
Well, it's a coincidence,

14:15.671 --> 14:17.409
a girl with the same necklace.

14:17.410 --> 14:20.089
Unless Kristian Herz
took another girl.

14:20.090 --> 14:21.459
It's possible.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.299
Maybe we should look into
reports of other missing girls.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.839
Well, I will do everything I can...

14:26.840 --> 14:29.729
but I must ask, what does
Mrs Webster expect to find?

14:31.280 --> 14:33.149
Her daughter.

14:33.150 --> 14:34.499
Her daughter is dead.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.001
I know, but I promised her.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.119
Look, if there's anything I can do,

14:39.120 --> 14:41.089
any way I can help, just...

14:41.090 --> 14:42.639
Iet me know.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.902
Wait...

14:45.500 --> 14:48.239
I've got something for you.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.434
Wait.

14:57.951 --> 14:59.361
This is for you.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.459
It's a song.

15:03.460 --> 15:05.339
A song?

15:05.340 --> 15:07.058
What's that got to do with the case?

15:08.730 --> 15:10.846
Nothing, it's just, I...

15:12.240 --> 15:14.719
You know, I wrote it and...

15:14.720 --> 15:17.019
Yeah, I should have said that.

15:17.020 --> 15:20.099
I thought you might like it and...

15:20.100 --> 15:23.092
you know, you have a CD player
in your car, and then...

15:26.390 --> 15:28.017
Thanks.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.680
You need a hand?

16:21.960 --> 16:23.154
I've heard it all now.

16:40.650 --> 16:42.389
Gem, I need to tell you something.

16:42.390 --> 16:43.759
I should've told you before,

16:43.760 --> 16:44.886
it's not fair on you.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.439
There's someone...

16:47.440 --> 16:49.806
Well, some things don't need
to be said out loud, do they?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.325
It just...

16:53.320 --> 16:54.969
..makes it real, doesn't it?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.245
And I think we've suffered
enough, don't you?

17:10.849 --> 17:13.569
I keep thinking about
what the doc said,

17:13.569 --> 17:17.489
about a place for me back
in England, for us.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.749
There's nothing for me here
now, not any more, is there?

17:19.750 --> 17:22.089
Well, we've talked about this.
Our lives are here.

17:22.089 --> 17:25.169
Pushing papers around on
a desk, three days a week.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.569
Compulsory bloody therapy...

17:26.569 --> 17:28.079
That's not why I signed up.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.869
We need something to change.

17:30.870 --> 17:31.999
Well, what about Matthew?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.849
He's 23. Well, we can't
leave him behind, can we?

17:34.850 --> 17:36.859
I thought, after what
happened a few months ago,

17:36.860 --> 17:38.169
that things would be different,

17:38.170 --> 17:40.931
but he's never going to forgive me -
so you could talk to him for us.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.491
Yeah.

17:49.210 --> 17:50.541
Yeah, fine.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.243
I'm sorry.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.289
These are his favourite.

18:21.290 --> 18:23.399
And these.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.389
When he liked something,
he'd buy two.

18:25.390 --> 18:26.439
I got that off him.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.039
Visit for you, Miss Stone.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.040
Right.

18:43.780 --> 18:46.119
Baptiste.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.291
Sergeant.

18:48.610 --> 18:50.729
Staff Sergeant now.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.599
Staff Sergeant. Forgive me.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.449
How are you?

18:54.450 --> 18:55.969
Alive.

18:55.970 --> 18:57.399
I've been in Northern Iraq.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.369
I went to find Daniel Reed,

18:59.370 --> 19:00.999
Henry Reed's son.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.331
Why?

19:05.290 --> 19:06.639
The girl who came back...

19:06.640 --> 19:09.089
Alice... she knew Henry Reed.

19:09.090 --> 19:11.810
The day before she set light
to herself inside that shed,

19:11.811 --> 19:13.479
she laid flowers on his grave.

19:13.480 --> 19:14.480
Baptiste...

19:15.691 --> 19:17.639
..this is over.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.479
Kristian Herz is rotting in prison

19:19.480 --> 19:21.049
for the abduction of Alice Webster,

19:21.050 --> 19:23.729
the same girl who ID'd him.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.159
What more do you want?

19:25.160 --> 19:26.449
Information.

19:26.450 --> 19:29.869
Information I think your father
will be able to help me with.

19:29.870 --> 19:32.479
My father needs help putting
his bloody socks on.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.649
What possible help could he be?

19:34.650 --> 19:36.880
If it wasn't important,
I wouldn't ask.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.281
He's not well.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.379
Tell me your questions
and I'll ask them.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.599
Look, I feel it would be
better if I was around...

19:49.600 --> 19:50.729
Those are the terms.

19:50.730 --> 19:53.129
It's not a negotiation.

19:53.130 --> 19:56.122
I need to ask your father
about his time in the Gulf War.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.119
Why?

19:59.120 --> 20:03.039
Because it's connected to the
abductions of Alice and Sophie.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.129
What do you mean?

20:05.130 --> 20:06.839
Your father killed a girl in Iraq.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.329
Not in battle.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.059
He murdered a civilian child.

20:11.581 --> 20:12.889
Killed a girl?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.680
I have it on good authority...

20:16.681 --> 20:17.852
"Good authority?"

20:18.931 --> 20:20.330
Whose bloody authority?

20:22.650 --> 20:25.722
Authority to accuse an
old man with Alzheimer's...

20:27.530 --> 20:29.739
..of murdering a child?!

20:29.740 --> 20:31.179
The man who told me,

20:31.180 --> 20:33.049
he has no reason to lie.

20:33.050 --> 20:34.289
The pieces fit.

20:34.290 --> 20:35.290
Leave.

20:35.291 --> 20:36.917
Right now.

20:42.681 --> 20:43.909
I'm sorry.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.889
It's hard to find out

20:46.890 --> 20:49.256
the ones you love are not
who you thought they were.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.409
Dad, I have to go.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.499
Hm?

21:30.500 --> 21:32.499
I'm going to go. I'll be back, OK?

21:32.500 --> 21:33.751
Are we going home?

21:35.670 --> 21:37.389
This is...

21:37.390 --> 21:39.560
This is your home now, OK?

21:39.561 --> 21:40.778
I'll be back.

22:27.411 --> 22:28.701
Look at this number.

22:28.702 --> 22:30.100
The day Henry Reed died,

22:30.101 --> 22:32.410
there were several
calls to this number.

22:32.411 --> 22:34.480
In the rest of the phone records,

22:34.481 --> 22:35.840
you can see more calls.

22:35.841 --> 22:38.490
Only at weekends, late at night.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.732
So, we must find out
who he was talking to.

22:46.692 --> 22:49.811
Ja, guten tag. Mein name ist
Jorn Lenhart, Polizei Eckhausen.

22:49.812 --> 22:52.310
Ich wollte gerne mit ihnen
uber einen Englander sprechen,

22:52.311 --> 22:54.927
er heisst Henry Reed...

22:56.611 --> 22:58.460
Hallo?

22:58.461 --> 23:00.020
They hung up.

23:00.021 --> 23:01.691
Can you trace the number?

23:01.692 --> 23:03.210
I would be most interested to learn

23:03.211 --> 23:05.224
why they are reluctant
to talk to us.

23:13.861 --> 23:16.540
The burns, we will have to wait.

23:16.541 --> 23:19.050
Give the skin a chance to heal,

23:19.051 --> 23:20.620
assess the damage,

23:20.621 --> 23:23.180
then we can consider our options...

23:23.181 --> 23:25.536
but there will be
extensive scarring.

23:27.331 --> 23:28.920
How is your pain?

23:28.921 --> 23:31.970
Fine. When can I go home?

23:31.971 --> 23:33.850
We'd like to monitor you

23:33.851 --> 23:35.490
for the next few hours...

23:35.491 --> 23:38.010
but, all being well,

23:38.011 --> 23:39.330
the end of the day.

23:39.331 --> 23:40.582
In time for Christmas.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.815
Thanks.

23:50.941 --> 23:52.545
I hate this place.

23:56.211 --> 23:59.980
Gem...

23:59.981 --> 24:01.210
Mr and Mrs Webster,

24:01.211 --> 24:02.620
I'm sorry to intrude.

24:02.621 --> 24:04.130
It's a time-sensitive matter,

24:04.131 --> 24:06.770
I was hoping I could have a
word with you, if that's OK?

24:06.771 --> 24:07.931
Yeah.

24:12.011 --> 24:14.050
Christ, this is the last
thing you need right now.

24:14.051 --> 24:15.268
What is it?

24:16.551 --> 24:18.180
There is a French news outlet

24:18.181 --> 24:21.010
who's got hold of a story that
they want me to comment on.

24:21.011 --> 24:23.740
They said they have got
independent sources...

24:23.741 --> 24:25.420
telling them your son, Matthew,

24:25.421 --> 24:27.628
Iocked Alice in the shed,
before she...

24:33.741 --> 24:35.470
They're planning to publish.

24:37.741 --> 24:38.900
Yeah?

24:38.901 --> 24:40.330
Well, we need to talk to them.

24:40.331 --> 24:41.930
We need to set the record straight.

24:41.931 --> 24:43.980
Why should we?

24:43.981 --> 24:45.198
It's true, isn't it?

24:46.261 --> 24:47.774
Why should we lie for him?

24:49.051 --> 24:50.427
Christ, Sam.

24:59.651 --> 25:00.982
Tell them we'll do it.

25:13.331 --> 25:14.930
What's wrong?

25:14.931 --> 25:17.370
It's just cramps again.

25:17.371 --> 25:20.277
I'll find a doctor. No, no.

25:20.302 --> 25:22.271
They keep checking
on me every 30 minutes,

25:22.296 --> 25:24.295
I'm sure it's nothing.

25:24.403 --> 25:25.737
If you want to help...

25:25.925 --> 25:28.677
...get them to turn that
bloody music off.

25:28.702 --> 25:30.980
If I hear one more Christmas song,

25:30.981 --> 25:32.266
I'll kill someone.

25:35.471 --> 25:37.821
God!

25:37.822 --> 25:39.340
Why am I here?

25:39.341 --> 25:40.571
You know why you're here.

25:40.572 --> 25:41.982
You know why you did this.

25:43.981 --> 25:45.620
All night, I couldn't sleep.

25:45.621 --> 25:48.360
I just kept thinking, "What if
something's wrong with the baby?"

25:48.361 --> 25:49.828
Then we'll deal with it.

25:50.981 --> 25:52.260
Your sister's on the way.

25:52.261 --> 25:53.546
Try not to worry.

25:55.371 --> 25:57.100
Everything's going to be fine.

25:57.101 --> 25:58.701
How do you know?

25:58.702 --> 26:01.370
Because I'm your dad
and I said so.

26:03.211 --> 26:06.010
This is ridiculous,
I'm getting a doctor.

26:06.011 --> 26:07.420
Doctor!

26:07.421 --> 26:11.711
Doktor! Meine Tochter braucht Hilfe.
Sie hat Schmerzen.

26:11.712 --> 26:13.050
Sofort!

26:15.001 --> 26:17.420
It's all right, love, here's
the doctor. You'll be fine now.

26:17.421 --> 26:19.290
It's just cramp. It's just cramp.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.735
Just let me have a quick look.

26:24.091 --> 26:27.260
Schwester! Lassen Sie
einen OP fertig machen, sofort!

26:27.261 --> 26:29.370
What? You have
a placental abruption.

26:29.395 --> 26:32.220
The lining of the placenta's coming
away from the wall of the uterus.

26:32.221 --> 26:33.701
The baby? The baby?

26:33.702 --> 26:35.780
The heart rate is not what
we would like.

26:35.781 --> 26:37.620
An anaesthetist
will put in an epidural,

26:37.621 --> 26:40.374
and we will be performing
an emergency Caesarean.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.460
But you'll be OK. You'll be fine.

26:44.461 --> 26:46.543
Don't worry. I'm right here.

26:47.741 --> 26:48.870
I'm right here.

26:48.871 --> 26:51.581
Give me your hand, that's it,
don't worry.

26:51.582 --> 26:54.660
I'm right by you, I'm right by you.

26:54.661 --> 26:57.780
Your birth was difficult,
but your mother got through it.

26:57.781 --> 26:59.190
Tell me.

26:59.191 --> 27:02.910
Well, it was...
The hospital was...

27:02.911 --> 27:05.701
It was...

27:05.702 --> 27:08.300
The hospital was near...

27:08.301 --> 27:10.269
The hospital...

27:11.901 --> 27:14.940
But you're here now.
That's all that matters.

27:14.941 --> 27:19.140
And your little one will be fine,
too. Don't worry. Don't worry.

27:19.141 --> 27:21.143
You'll be fine.

27:31.712 --> 27:34.300
This is Monsieur Soumier,
and Mr and Mrs Webster.

27:34.301 --> 27:35.552
Guillaume, please.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.861
Shall we sit down?

28:01.201 --> 28:05.340
Thank you for sitting down with me,
especially with your injuries.

28:05.341 --> 28:06.820
That's fine.

28:10.381 --> 28:16.340
As you might have been told,
a source has given some information.

28:16.341 --> 28:19.810
Now, I only wish to print the truth.

28:19.811 --> 28:22.220
We are not one of those papers
that like to...

28:22.221 --> 28:24.350
make sensational stories, you know?

28:24.351 --> 28:25.454
Good.

28:29.301 --> 28:31.630
I was told that your boy, Matthew,

28:31.631 --> 28:35.818
he locked your girl in the shed
in which she took her own life.

28:36.991 --> 28:40.990
The lock's been broken on that shed
ever since we moved in.

28:41.114 --> 28:44.193
It's one of those jobs you think you'll
get round to, and never do, you know?

28:44.218 --> 28:48.278
Like the corner of the carpet coming up, so I don't
know where you got that from but it's wrong.

28:50.541 --> 28:53.749
And you can't go printing things
that aren't true, can you?

28:54.791 --> 28:58.940
I understand. Only, my source
was quite specific...

28:58.941 --> 29:00.306
Yeah, well, they're wrong.

29:03.712 --> 29:04.986
He's a good lad.

29:20.381 --> 29:21.420
Dad!

29:21.421 --> 29:23.620
How is she?

29:23.621 --> 29:25.740
In surgery.

29:25.741 --> 29:29.530
But look, your sister's strong.
She'll get through this.

29:29.531 --> 29:32.022
Her and the baby. Don't you worry.

29:40.501 --> 29:43.100
OK, I will spray your stomach.

29:43.101 --> 29:46.457
Tell me if you feel
a cold sensation.

30:12.901 --> 30:16.630

Danke.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.380
Of all the places I thought
I'd be this Christmas Eve,

31:23.381 --> 31:25.220
this was low on the list.

31:25.221 --> 31:27.644
But still on the list? Hm?

31:44.871 --> 31:46.224
Wolfgang Hausler?

32:03.021 --> 32:05.180
Merci.

32:05.181 --> 32:06.750
Vous parlez Francais?

32:06.751 --> 32:08.082
English?

32:14.231 --> 32:15.596
Oh...

32:17.722 --> 32:22.180
That is The Three Ages Of Man
And Death, no?

32:22.181 --> 32:23.950
You know Hans Baldung?

32:23.951 --> 32:27.350
My wife loves art.
Did you paint this?

32:27.351 --> 32:29.603
Between clients. It relaxes me.

32:30.871 --> 32:32.830
It's so close to the real thing.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.630
Much like me, then.

32:34.631 --> 32:36.990
Close, but still
not quite the real thing.

32:36.991 --> 32:40.472
Have you any of your own work?

32:41.951 --> 32:44.181
I have yet to find my own style,
you know?

32:45.712 --> 32:46.918
It's impressive.

32:48.271 --> 32:51.559
What is it you want?
I'm assuming it's not my services.

32:54.031 --> 32:58.900
We are investigating the death
of Henry Reed. You knew him?

33:01.111 --> 33:05.461
I didn't realise he was dead.
He was a client.

33:05.462 --> 33:08.540
He called you the night he died,
several times.

33:08.541 --> 33:10.395
The night of the 14th December.

33:11.871 --> 33:14.900
Last time I spoke to Henry...

33:14.901 --> 33:16.980
Yes. He wanted to see me.

33:16.981 --> 33:18.983
Obviously, I mean, look at me!

33:20.541 --> 33:21.870
I couldn't.

33:21.871 --> 33:24.750
He wanted me to come to his house,
but I couldn't.

33:24.751 --> 33:26.343
I was booked up for the night.

33:35.021 --> 33:36.909
That is all that passed?

33:39.791 --> 33:41.270
That's all.

33:45.931 --> 33:48.930
Did he mean anything to you?
Henry Reed?

33:48.931 --> 33:52.321
If every dead body you detectives
came across meant something to you,

33:52.322 --> 33:54.790
you would never get out of bed
in the morning.

33:57.501 --> 33:58.945
No.

34:00.731 --> 34:05.418
This job, like yours, there's
no room for these kinds of emotions.

34:07.251 --> 34:10.090
My job is looking
for missing children.

34:10.091 --> 34:13.242
So we shall have to agree
to disagree on this point.

34:15.170 --> 34:17.685
I understand.
We'll leave you in peace.

34:21.371 --> 34:23.054
Thank you for your time.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.500
Sir...

35:17.501 --> 35:21.331
my name is Julien Baptiste.
We met almost two years ago.

35:21.332 --> 35:22.526
Do you remember?

35:25.811 --> 35:27.331
I'm sorry, I...

35:27.332 --> 35:30.460
I was on the garrison,
here in Eckhausen.

35:32.011 --> 35:34.935
It was back when the girl,
Alice Webster, returned.

35:50.811 --> 35:53.291
Memory is a complicated thing.

35:55.891 --> 35:59.250
Sometimes, a sound,

35:59.251 --> 36:00.457
a smell...

36:03.452 --> 36:07.900
They can conjure us into places we'd
forgotten about as if we were there.

36:10.891 --> 36:13.940
What time is it?
Is it time to leave?

36:13.941 --> 36:15.613
Is the car here?

36:19.371 --> 36:22.909
In a moment.
We can wait here for the car.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.221
The heat in Iraq...

36:32.452 --> 36:34.820
..it's different, no?

36:34.821 --> 36:36.869
To any other kind of heat.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.665
It was so dry.

36:41.322 --> 36:44.302
A heat that sucked
all the life from your mouth.

36:46.861 --> 36:50.300
You imagine those places
to be barren, hostile.

36:50.301 --> 36:52.110
But there are people there.

36:53.171 --> 36:55.503
Living their life
just like you and I.

36:56.691 --> 36:59.296
Empty Coca-Cola bottles
on the street.

37:01.452 --> 37:05.024
Car horns, always, a constant din.

37:06.241 --> 37:07.742
And the light...

37:13.891 --> 37:15.620
I know what happened there.

37:17.381 --> 37:19.224
Mirza Barzani told me.

37:21.101 --> 37:23.296
I know you killed that girl.

37:25.111 --> 37:28.480
So tell me -
tell me about Alice Webster.

37:28.481 --> 37:30.369
Tell me about Sophie Giroux.

37:32.481 --> 37:35.080
When are we going? We should
be leaving now, shouldn't we?

37:35.081 --> 37:36.840
We will. Your things are packed.

37:36.841 --> 37:38.081
We are going soon.

37:45.041 --> 37:46.679
Do you know him?

37:56.101 --> 37:58.300
That's Henry's boy.

37:58.301 --> 37:59.302
Daniel.

38:02.121 --> 38:04.660
He looks just like his father.

38:04.661 --> 38:09.542
You and Henry Reed, you were
in Iraq together, many years ago.

38:22.391 --> 38:25.380
What the three of us
did to that poor girl...

38:25.381 --> 38:28.010
The three of you?

38:28.011 --> 38:30.400
Who was the third person?

38:33.461 --> 38:35.461
Which girl?

38:35.462 --> 38:38.181
Are you talking about Alice Webster?

38:42.111 --> 38:44.110
We should be home by now.

38:44.111 --> 38:45.800
We cannot go right now.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.530
Don't tell me what we can
and can't do!

38:48.531 --> 38:49.870
Do you know who I am?

38:49.871 --> 38:51.180
Please, stay with me...

38:51.181 --> 38:52.671
Know your place, soldier!

38:54.541 --> 38:56.331
Was tun Sie hier?

38:56.332 --> 38:57.670
It's fine, it's fine...

38:57.671 --> 38:59.457
Verlassen Sie sofort die Station.

39:00.741 --> 39:02.550
Sofort.

39:40.131 --> 39:42.020
What are you doing?

39:42.021 --> 39:44.342
It's late. You should get up.

39:53.222 --> 39:56.316
Your dad's been offered
a new position. Back home.

39:58.301 --> 40:01.670
This is home. I have friends here.

40:01.671 --> 40:05.561
Yeah, they're not the right kind
of friends, though, are they?

40:05.562 --> 40:07.041
That's not up to you.

40:09.192 --> 40:11.331
Well, isn't it worth thinking about?

40:12.701 --> 40:14.384
Do you want to go?

40:17.091 --> 40:22.529
Oh... Maybe your dad's right,
maybe we all need a fresh start.

40:24.621 --> 40:26.770
You think that'll fix things?

40:26.771 --> 40:28.727
Matthew, your dad loves you.

40:29.871 --> 40:31.750
He got put on medical leave for you.

40:31.751 --> 40:33.560
Yeah, and then...

40:34.881 --> 40:36.473
What?

40:38.111 --> 40:39.624
Nothing.

40:40.951 --> 40:43.100
Well, we can't carry on like this.

40:43.101 --> 40:45.752
So go. What's keeping you here?

42:17.391 --> 42:18.940
Hello?

42:18.941 --> 42:20.820
'I spoke to Matthew.'

42:20.821 --> 42:23.028
He doesn't want to go back
to England.

42:24.462 --> 42:26.750
So, what, he's decided for us?

42:26.751 --> 42:29.780
England could be
a new start for us, couldn't it?

42:29.781 --> 42:32.980
'What, you think a change of scenery
can just tear up the last two years?

42:32.981 --> 42:36.750
'It's not that simple. Sam,
wherever we go, we'll still be us.'

42:36.751 --> 42:40.130
We need to try and sort it,
don't we?

42:40.131 --> 42:42.201
We can fix this.

42:43.301 --> 42:46.054
It's not just Matthew.

42:47.741 --> 42:51.910
It's me, it's me, too.
I'm not ready to go.

42:51.911 --> 42:55.900
When you come back there's
something I want to show you.

42:55.901 --> 42:57.990
'All right. I won't be long.

42:57.991 --> 42:59.913
'I love you.'

43:02.101 --> 43:03.659
OK.

43:19.061 --> 43:20.830
Sam.

43:20.831 --> 43:22.660
What are you doing here?

43:22.661 --> 43:24.710
Didn't you get my messages?

43:24.711 --> 43:27.290
I thought we said we weren't
going to see each other,

43:27.291 --> 43:28.920
that that was for the best.

43:28.921 --> 43:30.559
I'm bloody pregnant.

44:01.941 --> 44:03.226
Sweetheart...

44:04.232 --> 44:06.430
How are you feeling?

44:06.431 --> 44:08.023
Awful.

44:09.631 --> 44:11.576
I think she's asleep now.

44:13.811 --> 44:15.051
Do you want to hold her?

44:17.251 --> 44:18.661
No, it's OK.

44:21.151 --> 44:24.029
I don't know how we can
ever thank you, Eve.

44:26.011 --> 44:29.344
Just don't ask me to make her
a younger brother.

44:31.111 --> 44:33.930
Being pregnant once
was definitely enough.

44:33.931 --> 44:35.860
Maybe next Christmas.

44:35.861 --> 44:37.920
Adopt a dog next time.

44:40.081 --> 44:45.030
All right. Let's allow
your sister to get some sleep.

44:47.501 --> 44:49.910
Don't go.

44:49.911 --> 44:52.391
I like listening to you all.

45:01.511 --> 45:03.950
Do you think
this will make any difference?

45:03.951 --> 45:07.569
I think Ilsa knows more
than she's saying.

45:10.661 --> 45:14.279
And we have to delve
a little deeper to know what it is.

45:36.222 --> 45:39.221
Again?
I have a client in five minutes.

45:39.222 --> 45:43.020
This will not take so long.
We wanted to bring you something.

45:43.021 --> 45:45.990
I told you all I know. Bringing
gifts will make no difference.

45:45.991 --> 45:47.435
May we come in?

46:01.391 --> 46:02.483
Open it.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.212
It's nice.

46:23.761 --> 46:25.638
We found it in Henry Reed's house.

46:27.001 --> 46:28.810
No note, but...

46:28.811 --> 46:32.133
am I wrong to think it was for you?

46:33.571 --> 46:34.981
A Christmas present?

46:37.072 --> 46:39.552
Henry always was extravagant.

46:41.212 --> 46:43.930
To you, perhaps,
he was just another client,

46:43.931 --> 46:46.172
but he cared for you, it seems,
in his way.

46:50.202 --> 46:52.201
I do not think you are guilty.

46:52.202 --> 46:55.626
If I did, I would come here
with more than an artist's easel.

46:56.931 --> 46:59.172
But I do think you're holding back.

47:02.451 --> 47:05.022
I am not saying
this is what happened, yes?

47:07.342 --> 47:10.650
But imagine Henry called me
that night.

47:10.651 --> 47:12.369
Imagine if I went to his house.

47:14.641 --> 47:18.810
I would always wait outside until I
saw his car pull up in the driveway.

47:18.811 --> 47:21.507
Only when I saw him go in
would I follow.

47:22.811 --> 47:25.735
Neighbours, you know?
What would they think?

47:35.361 --> 47:38.530
That night,
I waited outside Henry's house...

47:38.531 --> 47:41.800
Hypothetically, of course.

47:41.801 --> 47:43.450
I waited.

47:46.291 --> 47:49.738
'For an hour, I waited.
But his car did not show.

47:52.261 --> 47:57.381
'Finally, I grew tired. "Damn
the neighbours," is what I thought.'

48:08.691 --> 48:10.647
Henry, it's Ilsa.

48:12.621 --> 48:14.031
'The door was open.

48:17.342 --> 48:18.855
'And then I saw him.'

48:20.981 --> 48:22.937
Lying in the living room.

48:58.011 --> 49:00.410
'I ran, OK?'

49:00.411 --> 49:03.160
I know how this looks. Someone
like me, in this man's house,

49:03.161 --> 49:04.571
I would be blamed.

49:07.531 --> 49:09.360
I believe you.

49:09.361 --> 49:13.780
And tell me, are you sure
the car was not there?

49:13.781 --> 49:16.170
Positive. I waited long enough.

49:18.261 --> 49:22.081
The police report says the car
was found outside his house.

49:22.082 --> 49:26.780
Somebody moved the car later.
When he was already dead.

49:26.781 --> 49:29.500
Making suicide unlikely, no?

49:31.611 --> 49:34.081
Thank you for your help.

49:34.082 --> 49:38.428
If he was murdered...
and you find out...

49:40.141 --> 49:42.097
We will tell you.

50:05.731 --> 50:06.993
Hey.

50:11.851 --> 50:13.810
How are you doing?

50:13.811 --> 50:16.650
They discharged me, so...

50:16.651 --> 50:18.810
You're not getting
a cab back, are you?

50:18.811 --> 50:20.859
Gemma's bringing the car round.

50:23.571 --> 50:25.650
Was it a boy or a girl?

50:25.651 --> 50:27.164
Girl.

50:28.781 --> 50:29.782
Where is she?

50:32.222 --> 50:33.980
She's with my sister.

50:33.981 --> 50:36.580
I was a surrogate,
for her and her husband,

50:36.581 --> 50:39.860
so now I have the stretch-marks
and hormones of a new mum

50:39.861 --> 50:41.692
but none of the responsibility.

50:44.501 --> 50:45.991
Sorry. I didn't know.

50:54.581 --> 50:55.581
I knew.

50:58.251 --> 51:00.663
I knew what I was getting into,
and I still...

51:07.701 --> 51:09.532
You just...

51:11.811 --> 51:13.631
You get attached.

51:17.631 --> 51:21.260
Look after something long enough
and it starts to take hold of you.

51:25.352 --> 51:28.435
I agreed to this
because I never wanted a family.

51:33.111 --> 51:34.530
Oh, I'm so sorry.

51:34.531 --> 51:36.730
I can't believe I'm saying
all this to you.

51:36.731 --> 51:38.450
It's OK.

51:38.451 --> 51:40.703
It doesn't matter.

51:46.061 --> 51:47.585
Nothing matters any more.

51:50.861 --> 51:52.465
Sam.

52:03.301 --> 52:06.010
That's enough fresh air for you.

52:06.011 --> 52:07.467
Back inside.

52:09.581 --> 52:10.980
Yes, sir.

52:26.102 --> 52:27.370
What next?

52:27.371 --> 52:30.351
Well, a good question.
I was asking it myself.

52:30.352 --> 52:32.610
Daniel Reed's father is murdered,

52:32.611 --> 52:36.460
then not long after
he goes absent without leave.

52:36.461 --> 52:40.660
His father must have been involved
in Alice's abduction,

52:40.661 --> 52:43.020
and Daniel knows something.

52:43.021 --> 52:44.530
Yeah, but how to find him?

52:44.531 --> 52:48.221
Well, he may call his...

52:48.222 --> 52:52.020
his girl... girlfriend...

52:52.021 --> 52:55.211
Julien?
Pull over, I need to... Pull over...

52:55.212 --> 52:58.716
Julien? Julien? Julien?

53:01.102 --> 53:04.810
Zentrale, das ist Wagen 5. Wir
brauchen sofort einen Krankenwagen.

53:04.811 --> 53:09.020
Wir sind auf der B43, ungefahr zwei
Kilometer hinter der Tankstelle.

53:09.021 --> 53:10.650
Julien, can you hear me?

53:10.651 --> 53:11.902
Julien!

53:32.092 --> 53:33.696
'Hello?'

53:42.102 --> 53:43.148
Ja.

54:46.232 --> 54:47.540
Detective Lenhart.

54:47.541 --> 54:50.050
I'm sorry to call so late.
I needed to ask you something.

54:50.051 --> 54:51.268
OK.

54:53.591 --> 54:54.900
Mind if I come in?

54:54.901 --> 54:56.460
Well, actually, I was just...

54:56.461 --> 54:57.541
It won't take long.

54:59.951 --> 55:02.181
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Sure. Come in.

55:05.741 --> 55:07.530
I'm sorry to disturb.

55:07.531 --> 55:11.101
Excuse the mess. I'm due to retire
in a couple of weeks,

55:11.102 --> 55:14.050
so thought I'd get a head-start
on clearing my stuff out, you know.

55:14.051 --> 55:15.427
Hm.

55:17.461 --> 55:22.101
This girl, she was reported missing
in 2008.

55:22.102 --> 55:24.330
Lena Garber.

55:24.331 --> 55:27.250
She was troubled,
her parents assumed she ran away.

55:27.251 --> 55:30.310
I called her mother and she said
you were a friend of the family.

55:30.311 --> 55:33.700
Yep. Yep. I haven't seen them
for years, mind you.

55:33.701 --> 55:35.271
Why do you ask?

55:37.470 --> 55:40.923
This was taken
only four years ago...

55:40.924 --> 55:43.085
It appears to be the same girl, no?

55:50.075 --> 55:52.316
Yeah, definitely, it could be.

55:56.304 --> 55:58.716
And in the front is Alice Webster.

56:01.674 --> 56:03.494
Jesus!

56:05.724 --> 56:10.684
Alice and Lena... I don't
understand - what does that mean?

56:11.724 --> 56:14.753
Well, I was hoping, since you knew
the family, you might...

56:14.754 --> 56:16.005
Daddy?

56:21.674 --> 56:23.813
I told you to stay in your room.

56:25.794 --> 56:27.513
I didn't know you had a family?

56:27.514 --> 56:29.313
My ex-wife lives in London.

56:29.314 --> 56:31.074
I don't get to see
my little girl very much.

56:32.434 --> 56:34.673
Go back to bed, sweetheart.

56:34.674 --> 56:36.494
I've done a picture.

56:38.205 --> 56:39.877
Can I see it?

56:45.874 --> 56:46.923
What is it?

56:46.924 --> 56:49.163
That's me and Mummy.

56:49.164 --> 56:50.802
In the basement.

56:52.364 --> 56:54.873
I think we should continue
this...
