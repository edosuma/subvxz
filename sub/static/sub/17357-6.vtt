00:12.199 --> 00:15.335
- How you persevering?
- Oh, my God.

00:15.345 --> 00:18.324
My head feels like a dark, dank cave.

00:18.654 --> 00:20.729
And there's a teeny
tiny construction worker

00:20.739 --> 00:23.560
jackhammering on a never-ending loop.

00:23.570 --> 00:25.762
Okay. What'd you get into last night?

00:25.772 --> 00:29.868
I think I took a road
trip to Mexico with Tinya.

00:29.877 --> 00:32.648
Ate some chicharrÃ³nes, drank some Tequila.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.966
Finished up the night with a donkey show.

00:34.976 --> 00:36.753
- Mexico's about 2,000 miles away.
- Yeah.

00:36.763 --> 00:37.945
And who the hell is Tinya?

00:39.610 --> 00:40.991
Can I get you guys anything else?

00:41.001 --> 00:43.541
What? We... we haven't even ordered yet.

00:43.551 --> 00:45.559
Oh, God. Sorry.

00:45.569 --> 00:47.976
- I'm, like, really hungover.
- That's my thing.

00:47.986 --> 00:50.658
No, this is not how I'm going
to spend my Wednesday morning.

00:50.668 --> 00:53.472
You two, y'all need to level out,

00:53.482 --> 00:54.863
because I'm gonna get you
an alcoholic beverage.

00:54.871 --> 00:55.848
I'm gonna have one too.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.518
So I won't be the only
one that not drinking.

00:57.521 --> 00:59.606
Bloody mary, bloody mary, bloody mary.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.239
What's with the lights in here?

01:07.651 --> 01:09.395
You gonna ralph, Macchio?

01:09.405 --> 01:11.524
No, I just, uh...

01:12.783 --> 01:13.865
Mary?

01:13.875 --> 01:16.755
Kevin?

01:57.574 --> 02:00.555
So, uh, what exactly is this again?

02:00.887 --> 02:03.061
You're supposed to be
able to talk to ghosts.

02:03.071 --> 02:04.429
I'm not supposed to say.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.007
Yeah, right.

02:06.017 --> 02:07.475
We're gonna summon Bloody Mary.

02:07.805 --> 02:09.053
Sounds scary.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.073
She was buried alive a hundred years ago.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.473
If you say her name three times,

02:12.805 --> 02:15.906
she appears in the mirror
and claws your eyes out.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.428
How's that for scary?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.393
That's fine. I'm just happy to be included.

02:19.690 --> 02:21.798
Okay. She only comes out on Halloween,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.596
and it's almost midnight. Ready?

02:24.920 --> 02:27.338
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary,

02:27.669 --> 02:29.181
Bloody Mary.

02:38.494 --> 02:40.249
Man, I knew this was nonsense.

02:40.579 --> 02:42.060
Right?

02:42.069 --> 02:43.815
Yeah... yeah.

02:43.825 --> 02:45.115
I'm out of here.

02:45.446 --> 02:47.102
Better not tell anyone I
let you hang out with me,

02:47.432 --> 02:48.956
shit-eater.

02:51.703 --> 02:53.888
You can see me, can't you?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.563
But you're not afraid of me, are you?

02:59.517 --> 03:01.502
How come you won't look me in the eye?

03:04.747 --> 03:05.962
Oh!

03:05.972 --> 03:07.816
Bloody Jes...

03:07.826 --> 03:09.968
bloody Jesus. I'm sorry.
That is so embarrassing.

03:09.978 --> 03:11.897
Something's happening.

03:12.229 --> 03:14.801
What? I'm becoming a statue.

03:14.811 --> 03:16.457
Oh. Oh, my God, no.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.575
That is completely natural. You're...

03:18.585 --> 03:19.843
you're just having an erection.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.492
Have you never had one before?

03:23.617 --> 03:24.843
Um...

03:27.159 --> 03:28.408
let's...

03:28.418 --> 03:30.362
let's have a talk.

03:30.371 --> 03:32.413
I can't believe I'm seeing you right now.

03:32.423 --> 03:34.301
You've come a long way from that little boy

03:34.311 --> 03:35.701
I used to hang out with every Halloween.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.413
Feeling pretty rough
today, I got to be honest.

03:37.423 --> 03:39.332
But thanks, thanks.

03:39.342 --> 03:41.718
Come on. I'm sure the girls are,
like, beating down your door.

03:41.728 --> 03:43.504
You know... I've been...

03:43.514 --> 03:46.483
yeah, I've been sort of dating
this one girl, Camomile.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.669
She's, uh, kind of playing hard to get,

03:48.679 --> 03:50.666
so in turn I've been playing harder to get.

03:50.996 --> 03:52.642
You know, and now we're at
a point where we're both

03:52.652 --> 03:54.594
just a little too hard for each other.

03:54.604 --> 03:56.615
And it's very unclear
whether either one of us

03:56.625 --> 03:58.401
will ever be gotten.

03:58.411 --> 04:01.117
Well, I think you're a catch.

04:01.127 --> 04:02.584
Thanks.

04:05.431 --> 04:08.401
Welcome back to our
spooky Halloween special.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.883
I'm here once again

04:10.893 --> 04:14.126
with celebrated paranormal
communicator, Camomile White.

04:14.136 --> 04:15.419
It is such a pleasure to have you back.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.041
Thank you, Wesley.

04:17.051 --> 04:19.291
Let's take a call. Caller, are you there?

04:19.302 --> 04:21.244
Hi, Wesley. Hi, Camomile.

04:21.254 --> 04:23.441
So I was planning on spending Halloween

04:23.771 --> 04:25.416
down at the parade in the village,

04:25.426 --> 04:28.925
but I wasn't sure if it was safe.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.879
I guess my question is, do you foresee

04:30.889 --> 04:33.967
any sort of tragedy?

04:37.179 --> 04:38.825
I see the parade.

04:38.835 --> 04:41.108
Big crowd.

04:41.118 --> 04:42.973
Lots of fun. Lots of...

04:44.627 --> 04:47.233
wait, there's... there's something else.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.114
No.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.001
It's okay.

04:52.011 --> 04:54.683
It's just dancing.

04:54.693 --> 04:57.065
- Oh!
- Fear not, dear caller.

04:57.075 --> 04:59.814
I predict nothing but fun for you tonight.

05:01.412 --> 05:02.728
That's fantastic!

05:02.737 --> 05:05.077
Enjoy.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.040
Sorry, just... the reason I ask

05:07.372 --> 05:09.877
is because I'm slightly clairvoyant myself.

05:09.887 --> 05:13.486
And last night I had this terrible vision.

05:13.496 --> 05:15.506
It was in the middle of the parade route,

05:15.516 --> 05:17.965
right around Waverly Place.

05:18.297 --> 05:20.912
People were burning, screaming.

05:21.244 --> 05:22.425
Oh. Um...

05:23.626 --> 05:24.918
Miss white, uh...

05:26.805 --> 05:29.719
Is there any chance that
you could be mistaken?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.805
I stand by my earlier prediction.

05:39.815 --> 05:44.705
No one will be set on fire at
this year's Halloween parade.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.148
Camomile White, ladies and gentlemen.

05:48.158 --> 05:49.605
This is why the world loves you.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.425
I should set you on fire.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.115
You were supposed to be
monitoring the phone calls.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.571
I don't understand. They loved you.

05:54.581 --> 05:56.359
I just went on national TV

05:56.369 --> 05:59.073
and confidently predicted
that in a New York City parade

05:59.083 --> 06:01.292
that attracts over 50,000 weirdos a year,

06:01.301 --> 06:03.155
nobody was going to be set on fire.

06:04.248 --> 06:05.628
What if something happened?

06:05.638 --> 06:07.979
What... what if it's some kind of setup?

06:07.988 --> 06:09.536
Do you know how that would look for me.

06:09.546 --> 06:11.024
For my career?

06:11.034 --> 06:12.548
Boom! Up in flames.

06:12.558 --> 06:14.510
I'm so sorry. What can I do to fix it?

06:14.841 --> 06:17.424
We'll just have to go to the parade,

06:17.755 --> 06:18.936
check out Waverly Place,

06:18.946 --> 06:20.924
make sure nobody gets lit on fire.

06:20.933 --> 06:23.075
But what if someone does get set on fire?

06:23.085 --> 06:26.253
Then we'll just have to extinguish them

06:26.263 --> 06:30.136
before anybody notices what we do.

06:34.904 --> 06:36.914
I think she was hitting on me, Roofie.

06:36.924 --> 06:39.363
- What makes you say that?
- I don't know.

06:39.373 --> 06:42.010
She kept asking who I was dating
and paying me compliments.

06:42.020 --> 06:43.833
Like, she didn't have to do that.

06:43.843 --> 06:45.255
Wait, where did you meet this bitch anyway?

06:45.265 --> 06:48.037
We met randomly in this basement
mirror when I was a kid.

06:48.047 --> 06:50.818
You know, she was so hot. I had
this super-mega crush on her.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.095
Sometimes I'd even have
wet nightmares about her.

06:54.105 --> 06:56.115
But all she ever saw
me as was a little kid.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.604
That's it.

06:57.614 --> 06:59.028
- What?
- It's the babysitter conundrum.

06:59.038 --> 07:00.550
You found a loophole.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.603
What's the babysitter "condrumdrum"?

07:02.613 --> 07:04.589
Look, it's when a boy has
a crush on his babysitter.

07:04.599 --> 07:06.122
But he's too young for her.

07:06.453 --> 07:09.522
When he finally gets old enough
where age doesn't matter to her,

07:09.532 --> 07:10.847
she's too old for him.

07:10.857 --> 07:12.081
But in this case, you know,

07:12.412 --> 07:13.826
bloody Mary's a ghost. She doesn't age.

07:13.836 --> 07:15.549
So you guys caught up.

07:15.559 --> 07:17.005
It's like fate, man.

07:17.015 --> 07:18.528
By this point, I'm like a full

07:18.538 --> 07:20.513
presidential term older than her, though.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.805
What are these for, by the way?

07:21.815 --> 07:22.974
You don't need to worry about this.

07:23.305 --> 07:24.487
You need to worry about getting on

07:24.497 --> 07:25.877
that slutty Mary's pa-chank.

07:25.887 --> 07:27.796
- How am I gonna do that?
- You know, I don't know.

07:27.806 --> 07:30.622
Be romantic. Find something
from your past together.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.211
"Herro"?

07:45.221 --> 07:46.801
Ah... oh.

07:46.811 --> 07:48.422
Hi.

07:48.432 --> 07:49.780
"Herro."

07:49.790 --> 07:51.699
Can I help you?

07:51.709 --> 07:53.663
Sister brothers.

07:55.053 --> 07:56.434
Hi, I... I, uh...

07:56.444 --> 07:58.586
I grew up here. I live...
I mean, I was an orphan.

07:58.596 --> 08:00.373
I grew up in the orphanage.
My name is Kevin.

08:00.383 --> 08:02.526
Kevin Pacalioglu.

08:02.536 --> 08:04.412
Oh, shit-eater.

08:04.422 --> 08:06.366
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, what's that?

08:06.376 --> 08:07.558
Oh.

08:07.568 --> 08:09.312
I, uh... I just stopped in

08:09.322 --> 08:12.027
because I wanted to ask you
a question about a mirror.

08:12.036 --> 08:14.311
A really special mirror that
used to be in the basement here.

08:14.321 --> 08:16.463
Uh, a friend of mine really loved it.

08:16.473 --> 08:19.476
A friend whose pa-chank I'm
desperately trying to beat up,

08:19.486 --> 08:20.933
- if you will.
- Oh.

08:20.943 --> 08:23.017
I was wondering if I could purchase,

08:23.027 --> 08:25.502
perchance borrow it, off of you.

08:25.512 --> 08:27.222
- Borrow it off of me?
- Yeah, borrow it...

08:27.232 --> 08:29.143
- Where's your English?
- Borrow it...

08:29.153 --> 08:30.410
- from me?
- For you... off of you.

08:30.742 --> 08:32.462
- You want to borrow a mirror?
- Can I borrow the mirror?

08:32.794 --> 08:35.996
You're the one who could
talk to spirits, aren't you?

08:36.006 --> 08:38.212
I'm not really supposed to say.

08:38.222 --> 08:39.967
No. Well, come with me.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.865
There's something I want
you to take a look at.

08:44.647 --> 08:47.053
Oh, wow.

08:47.062 --> 08:49.999
They really spruced up the place, huh?

08:50.009 --> 08:51.985
Did the state step in or something?

08:51.995 --> 08:53.740
All right, Kevin, listen to me.

08:53.750 --> 08:57.216
There have been some incidents recently.

08:57.226 --> 08:58.606
Ah.

08:58.616 --> 08:59.865
Kids getting hurt

08:59.875 --> 09:01.784
in horrible and inexplicable ways.

09:01.794 --> 09:03.606
Now, I can't be sure,

09:03.616 --> 09:07.581
but I believe there's
an evil spirit present.

09:08.450 --> 09:11.916
Now, if you can get rid of this demon,

09:11.926 --> 09:14.630
you can have that mirror for free.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.682
You got yourself a deal, sister.

09:16.692 --> 09:18.536
Good luck, and I'll come back to you later.

09:18.546 --> 09:20.532
Okay, thank you, sister brothers.

09:43.409 --> 09:44.790
Whoa.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.512
Let's go play somewhere else.

09:46.521 --> 09:49.335
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not right
under a teeter-totter.

09:50.494 --> 09:52.546
(Bleep) me on a cross.

10:01.085 --> 10:03.027
You're not so bad.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.187
Look at you.

10:04.197 --> 10:05.912
Ow! Foot!

10:08.826 --> 10:10.173
All right, listen, you little creep.

10:10.183 --> 10:11.898
Uh, let's get down to unfinished business.

10:11.908 --> 10:13.979
I'm kind of in a rush.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.833
All right, look, I want
to help you. I really do.

10:15.843 --> 10:17.954
But you have to tell me how, all right?

10:17.964 --> 10:19.312
I'm not a mind-reader. I'm a medium.

10:20.709 --> 10:23.157
I get that reaction a lot, actually.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.327
Uh, why don't we start over again.

10:24.654 --> 10:27.062
Here, all right? Here, look at this.

10:27.072 --> 10:28.331
Look at this flower.

10:31.007 --> 10:33.048
And you've ruined it with your mind.

10:33.058 --> 10:34.258
That's lovely.

10:35.942 --> 10:37.191
What have you found?

10:37.201 --> 10:39.045
Well, uh, I think I found your spirit.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.087
It appears he does have an
evil ghost orphan child,

10:42.097 --> 10:44.079
which is like the worst kind of ghost,

10:44.089 --> 10:45.893
and also the worst kind of child.

10:45.903 --> 10:47.092
She refuses to talk to me,

10:47.102 --> 10:48.678
so I have no idea how to help her.

10:48.688 --> 10:51.097
Well, if you want that special mirror,

10:51.106 --> 10:52.682
you have to deal with
that ghost child first.

10:52.692 --> 10:53.872
Please, sister brothers.

10:53.882 --> 10:55.111
I need that mirror by midnight.

10:55.438 --> 10:57.053
Well, then you'd better get back in there.

10:57.063 --> 11:00.631
Get busy. Remember, idle hands
are the devil's playground.

11:00.641 --> 11:02.445
No, this is the devil's playground.

11:02.455 --> 11:03.783
Oh, go on now.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.467
Okay, so welcome to my apartment.

11:14.477 --> 11:15.656
Come on in.

11:18.184 --> 11:19.661
No, Blob. I can't take
you for a float right now.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.891
- Why?
- Because I have company.

11:22.227 --> 11:23.476
I don't have to explain myself to you.

11:23.486 --> 11:26.549
Guys, guys. Come on.

11:26.559 --> 11:28.303
Hey, that's the last
thing I need right now.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.532
Okay?

11:29.542 --> 11:31.564
Stop. Go get in your box.

11:33.378 --> 11:35.766
Okay, so can you tell
me your name at least?

11:36.093 --> 11:38.472
No. Okay. What if I guess your name?

11:38.482 --> 11:40.226
If I guess your name will you nod?

11:40.236 --> 11:42.347
You'll nod. Good, great.

11:42.357 --> 11:43.715
I'm just gonna, like, rattle
off a bunch of girl names,

11:44.042 --> 11:45.628
and if I happen to get it, you stop me.

11:45.965 --> 11:47.313
All right? So here we go.

11:47.323 --> 11:50.157
Uh, Amber, Rachel, Jen...

11:50.167 --> 11:51.446
What?

11:51.455 --> 11:53.497
What... Rachel?

11:53.507 --> 11:55.658
Uh, Amber?

11:55.995 --> 11:57.610
It was the first one?

11:57.947 --> 11:59.127
I got it on the first shot.

12:00.326 --> 12:01.515
What are the odds of that?

12:06.322 --> 12:08.235
Everything looks good.

12:08.245 --> 12:10.455
Boy, is it hot in here or is it just...?

12:10.792 --> 12:12.269
Whoa!

12:12.279 --> 12:14.519
What the hell is going on here?

12:14.529 --> 12:16.451
You told me to get you the authentic one,

12:16.749 --> 12:18.830
and to just buy the
cheapest one for myself.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.993
This and this worries me.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.976
It's October outside. It's freezing cold.

12:25.986 --> 12:27.760
I can't have my assistant getting sick.

12:27.770 --> 12:30.753
You know what? You're
going to have to wear mine.

12:34.064 --> 12:35.937
See? This is so much better.

12:35.947 --> 12:37.800
I look amazing.

12:37.810 --> 12:39.683
And you still look sexy.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.110
Yeah, actually, I kind of do,

12:41.120 --> 12:43.529
just in like a masculine kind of way.

12:46.908 --> 12:48.752
So here's the backstory.

12:48.762 --> 12:51.170
I am a sexy, heroic firefighter,

12:51.180 --> 12:54.054
- and you are a burn victim.
- I don't get it.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.037
Wasn't the whole point of a fireman costume

12:56.046 --> 12:58.058
to justify the fire extinguishers?

12:58.068 --> 12:59.842
You know, the ones we'll need
in order to put out any fires

12:59.852 --> 13:01.071
at the parade?

13:01.081 --> 13:03.490
The plan is constantly evolving, Sue.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.877
It's alive. It's fluid.

13:04.887 --> 13:07.851
Try and keep up, okay?

13:07.861 --> 13:09.516
Trick or treat.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.628
Well, it's about time.

13:18.991 --> 13:21.558
Miss White, are you sure
it's wise to be on drugs

13:21.568 --> 13:22.965
during this operation?

13:23.292 --> 13:25.532
These are just a little
something to help me focus.

13:25.542 --> 13:28.714
What are you looking at, you little demon?

13:28.724 --> 13:29.843
Out.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.360
Now pull the car around.

13:31.370 --> 13:32.619
We don't want to be late.

13:32.629 --> 13:35.176
I love Halloween.

13:37.594 --> 13:39.636
Sugar? Hmm.

13:39.646 --> 13:42.262
The finer things, huh?

13:43.521 --> 13:44.700
There we go.

13:44.710 --> 13:47.148
Ooh, uh, how about a scone?

13:47.158 --> 13:50.330
I only got one, but I thought
maybe we could split it.

13:50.340 --> 13:52.659
Let me get my steak knife.

13:52.986 --> 13:54.205
I call her steak knively.

13:55.503 --> 13:56.683
Uh, I'm just gonna cut it in half.

13:56.693 --> 13:59.200
Oh, it's a little hard. Not stale.

13:59.210 --> 14:00.528
These day-olds are just a little cheaper.

14:00.538 --> 14:02.312
And, uh, they taste the same

14:02.322 --> 14:03.641
if you microwave them for about 15 seconds.

14:03.650 --> 14:05.425
Look, I can't... I can't do this.

14:05.434 --> 14:07.546
This is a two-way street, okay?
You got to communicate with me.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.468
I can't help you if you
don't tell me what you want.

14:09.478 --> 14:11.520
Come on, man. Help me out here.

14:11.530 --> 14:13.205
I need that mirror

14:13.215 --> 14:14.434
so I can impress Bloody Mary.

14:14.444 --> 14:16.049
She only comes out on Halloween,

14:16.059 --> 14:18.041
and sweet baby Lucifer,
Halloween is almost over.

14:18.051 --> 14:19.508
So just tell me.

14:23.146 --> 14:24.404
You want a psychic reading?

14:24.741 --> 14:26.218
No, that's Camomile White.

14:26.228 --> 14:28.478
She is a super-psycho hot b-i-t-c-h

14:28.775 --> 14:30.292
that I dated for a while.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.006
And I don't really want
to talk about it anymore.

14:32.016 --> 14:33.364
So why don't you just
mind your own business

14:33.374 --> 14:36.228
and drink your chamomile tea white now.

14:38.637 --> 14:39.856
What are you doing?

14:39.866 --> 14:42.899
No. No.

14:42.908 --> 14:44.256
You're my nightmare.

14:44.266 --> 14:47.319
Let me get my cleaning supplies.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.717
Why did I have to make imaginary black tea?

14:49.727 --> 14:51.115
You're all hopped up and acting crazy.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.259
So... Amber?

14:58.935 --> 15:00.590
Steak knively?

15:14.922 --> 15:17.598
What up, Tyson? How we doing tonight?

15:20.650 --> 15:21.839
Yo, what up?

15:21.849 --> 15:23.752
Hey, Roofie, it's me, man.

15:23.762 --> 15:25.943
I'm freaking out. I'm in crisis
zone here. I lost my ghost.

15:25.953 --> 15:27.826
And she's an evil little demon baby.

15:27.836 --> 15:30.869
She got steak knively with her,
and she means to do great harm.

15:30.878 --> 15:34.516
Calm down, calm down. Where was
the last place you seen her?

15:34.526 --> 15:37.261
She was here. We were having a
lovely tea party on the floor.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.649
All right, what was she doing?

15:38.659 --> 15:42.227
Uh, she was looking at this magazine here.

15:42.237 --> 15:43.813
Oh, my word.

15:43.822 --> 15:47.460
Roofie, where do you think
Camomile White is right now?

15:47.470 --> 15:49.383
Look, how the hell am I supposed
to know where Camomile White is

15:49.392 --> 15:50.800
on Halloween?

15:50.810 --> 15:52.762
Come on, man. That's like asking

15:53.099 --> 15:54.507
where kid rock is on the
4th of July. I don't know.

15:54.517 --> 15:55.736
Pick a Hooters.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.559
I'm serious.

15:57.569 --> 15:59.175
- Hey, Roof.
- What up, what up?

15:59.185 --> 16:00.602
I think I know

16:00.612 --> 16:02.634
where that Camomile
White bitch is right now.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.538
You deep in this, aren't you?

16:12.535 --> 16:15.201
This is absolute madness! It's not working!

16:15.211 --> 16:16.539
Maybe we should split up!

16:16.866 --> 16:18.244
We should split up!

16:18.254 --> 16:20.563
You go that way and I'll go this way.

16:20.573 --> 16:22.922
Keep phone on!

16:44.746 --> 16:46.055
Oh! Hey, hey, hey.

16:46.064 --> 16:47.363
Give me this. Give... give me that.

16:47.690 --> 16:49.345
What is this? What are
you, kidding me with this?

16:49.672 --> 16:52.279
You can't just wander around
decapitating people willy-nilly.

16:52.289 --> 16:54.172
That's not what you do. Bad!

16:54.182 --> 16:55.926
Bad ghost child.

16:55.936 --> 16:57.294
Who taught you how to carry
a sharp knife anyway, huh?

16:57.621 --> 16:59.266
You don't just carry it down like this.

16:59.276 --> 17:01.248
You carry it with the blade
up. That way if you fall,

17:01.258 --> 17:03.042
you kill yourself instantly.

17:03.052 --> 17:04.598
Common sense. God.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.817
And since we're getting to know

17:05.827 --> 17:07.017
steak knively so well anyway...

17:07.027 --> 17:09.891
flip her upside down.

17:09.901 --> 17:11.714
Lighter-meiser.

17:11.723 --> 17:13.964
You. What the hell are you doing here?

17:13.973 --> 17:15.134
Nothing.

17:15.461 --> 17:17.839
Uh, just... oh, my fingertips
are, like, freezing.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.009
Oh, my God.

17:19.336 --> 17:21.477
- It was you.
- What?

17:21.487 --> 17:24.460
I should have known. You
should have known what?

17:24.470 --> 17:26.512
You were going to come to the
parade and set yourself on fire

17:26.521 --> 17:28.732
- just to make me look bad.
- No.

17:28.742 --> 17:31.378
Madam, I assure you I
hatched no such scheme.

17:31.388 --> 17:32.637
Right. I'm phoning the police.

17:32.647 --> 17:33.965
Don't phone the police.

17:33.975 --> 17:36.919
Don't call the cops. It... it was me.

17:37.246 --> 17:38.534
What?

17:38.544 --> 17:39.892
I was the caller on the talk show.

17:40.229 --> 17:42.736
I had never been to the
Greenwich Village parade before.

17:42.746 --> 17:44.788
I've always wanted to go, but
you always made me stay home

17:44.798 --> 17:47.464
so you could watch me eat candy.

17:47.474 --> 17:50.715
You are going to eat so
much candy right now.

17:50.725 --> 17:54.828
And you're going to swallow all of it.

17:55.155 --> 17:57.464
Oh, my God. I'm so turned on right now.

17:57.474 --> 17:59.288
Why did you... why did you
just save me like that?

17:59.298 --> 18:00.676
Come on, Sue! Right bloody now!

18:00.686 --> 18:02.232
I have to go.

18:02.242 --> 18:03.689
When she starts in with the "bloody's",

18:03.699 --> 18:05.344
I know she's really upset.

18:05.354 --> 18:06.682
No, you don't have to
do everything she says.

18:07.009 --> 18:08.228
Oh...

18:08.238 --> 18:09.615
those two.

18:09.625 --> 18:12.103
You'd think they were bloody married, huh?

18:12.113 --> 18:15.116
Oh, Bloody Mary. Oh, my
God, it's almost midnight.

18:15.126 --> 18:17.594
You fudged me, didn't you,
you little planned fudger.

18:17.604 --> 18:18.664
Now I'm going to have to just use

18:18.991 --> 18:20.310
whatever stinking mirror is closest.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.441
Ah. Come on.

18:24.492 --> 18:26.573
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

18:26.910 --> 18:28.120
Kevin?

18:28.130 --> 18:29.309
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:29.319 --> 18:31.271
- Hi.
- Are we in a porta potty?

18:31.281 --> 18:33.422
Yeah, I know. I wanted to
do something more romantic

18:33.432 --> 18:36.138
and find the mirror from the
orphanage where we first met.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.021
Uh, but I didn't have any time.

18:38.031 --> 18:39.280
And I've been thinking a lot

18:39.289 --> 18:40.935
about the babysitter "condrumdrum."

18:40.945 --> 18:43.056
And I think Roofie was right.

18:43.066 --> 18:44.423
We beat this thing. We
can finally be together.

18:44.751 --> 18:46.069
Like bf and gf.

18:46.079 --> 18:47.952
Uh, what?

18:47.962 --> 18:49.409
Well, you know, I haven't
given a ton of thought

18:49.419 --> 18:53.314
to how the physical, uh,
intimate stuff would work.

18:53.324 --> 18:55.068
Okay, Kevin. That's enough.

18:55.078 --> 18:57.685
Um, we can't be together.

18:57.694 --> 18:59.875
We can't... what... what do you mean?

18:59.885 --> 19:01.064
Why?

19:02.531 --> 19:07.120
I always saw you as like a son.

19:07.130 --> 19:09.905
Oh, my God.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.878
Oh, my God. I'm an idiot.

19:12.888 --> 19:15.039
No, you're not. The thing is,

19:15.049 --> 19:16.684
I always wanted to be a mother.

19:16.694 --> 19:18.191
I could just never have kids of my own.

19:18.518 --> 19:20.728
But then I met you,

19:20.738 --> 19:22.680
and you were this sweet little boy

19:22.690 --> 19:24.147
who not only clearly needed a mother,

19:24.474 --> 19:26.764
but could also see ghosts.

19:27.983 --> 19:29.499
I thought it was perfect.

19:29.509 --> 19:30.956
Well, the same, Mary, I...

19:30.966 --> 19:33.444
I bungled our entire relationship.

19:33.454 --> 19:36.001
You were never really good with
picking up the nonverbal cues.

19:36.328 --> 19:38.519
No, not really.

19:43.910 --> 19:46.259
You weren't trying to
kill Camomile, were you?

19:50.204 --> 19:51.918
A mother.

19:53.217 --> 19:54.525
All right, come on.

19:54.535 --> 19:56.319
I want to show you something. Come here.

19:59.144 --> 20:00.719
Uh, Mary?

20:00.729 --> 20:03.237
This is Amber. Amber, this is Mary.

20:03.247 --> 20:04.456
Hi.

20:04.466 --> 20:06.181
Oh, my.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.302
That doesn't look very uninfected.

20:08.311 --> 20:10.492
Can I take a look?

20:13.148 --> 20:15.626
I think I can help you.

20:15.963 --> 20:17.410
What do you say, Kevin?

20:17.420 --> 20:18.669
Would that be all right?

20:19.006 --> 20:20.254
Yeah.

20:35.252 --> 20:36.915
Someone's in here.

20:42.346 --> 20:44.348
- You want a peanut butter cup?
- No.

20:44.358 --> 20:45.884
I'm going to stick with the corn.

20:45.885 --> 20:47.599
Trying to be at least a
little healthy, you know?

20:47.609 --> 20:49.185
Yeah, that's smart.

20:49.195 --> 20:50.996
How'd that thing work out
with you and Bloody Mary?

20:50.999 --> 20:52.198
Really, really badly.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.298
I completely misread that situation.

20:54.299 --> 20:55.534
That's okay, though. I'm going to go back

20:55.535 --> 20:56.965
to obsessing over Camomile White.

20:56.975 --> 20:59.378
It is one good decision
with you after another.

20:59.379 --> 21:01.177
Yeah, man. You know, and I base my decision

21:01.178 --> 21:02.525
on the fact that Camomile White exists

21:02.535 --> 21:03.725
for more than one day out of the year.

21:03.735 --> 21:05.608
So it increases my odds.

21:05.618 --> 21:08.750
Right. Let's... let's... let's hope so.
