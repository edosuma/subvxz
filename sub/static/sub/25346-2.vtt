Who do you think looks good?

10:57.281 --> 10:59.825
Oddly enough,
someone like Frasier Crane--

11:01.369 --> 11:04.497
I don't know why.
Maybe 'cause I like my sweater vest.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.956

11:11.379 --> 11:13.214
We can't-- He's a lost soul.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.008
-Tan, are you okay?
-We can't help him, Karamo!

11:16.092 --> 11:18.260
Tan, what's wrong? What's wrong?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.138
-His style icon's Frasier Crane!
-[Karamo] You're joking.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.767
Now this makes so much frigging sense
and it's terrifying.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.186
[Jonathan] Perfect, some lice shampoo.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.064
-Mm-hm. Didn't you just use her comb?
-I did.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.899
Veggie chicken strips.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.819

A lice killing shampoo that I'd love to
show you but there's a brand name on it

11:46.622 --> 11:50.209
so I'm not quite sure if I can,
but it is lice, I am nervous.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.795
I did use a plastic comb
that's right here.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.256
I did use this comb.

11:55.339 --> 11:59.176
This is neat, I like this.
Knives should be in their own drawer.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.887
I'm trying to make sure
this isn't a louse right now.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.265
[Bobby] Is that a little baby lice?
[gasps]

12:04.765 --> 12:07.601
-No, that's just dandruff. Ew.
-It's like hair, yeah.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.564
You have been together three years?
Is marrying her something you wanna do?

12:11.647 --> 12:16.110
Yes. I wanna take that step to show her
that I'm committed to her.

12:16.193 --> 12:20.322
Do you think that Shannan
wants to take the next step with you?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.075
I think I've been receiving
some hints lately.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.954
She's kind of let slip her ring size
and we went shopping...

12:27.037 --> 12:29.999
That's not a hint,
that's called a kick in the ass.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.209
-That's what that's called.
-We went shopping

12:32.293 --> 12:36.755
and she passed a window with jewelry,
and she's like, "I like this band."

12:36.839 --> 12:41.051
-So, what has been the hold up?
-I don't know how to do it.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.471
Marriage is a scary step.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.390
There's a lot of pressure on men
to do it right.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.725
But at the end of the day,

12:47.808 --> 12:51.228
if you truly love this person
and you wanna spend your life with them,

12:51.312 --> 12:55.483
you gotta step up
and be the man for your partner.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.235
By the end of this week,
what are you gonna do?

12:58.319 --> 13:01.322
-I'm gonna propose to Shannan.
-Hey.

13:02.156 --> 13:05.534
We figured out what was holding him back,
so over this next week,

13:05.618 --> 13:08.204
we're gonna figure out
how to propose.

13:08.287 --> 13:12.249
-I'm getting pretty excited.
-Boy, you seem so excited.

13:12.333 --> 13:16.212

You tuck in your shirts usually, right?

It's called a French tuck.

We're doing it slightly at the front.
Yeah, all you need is a little tuck

but it's not highlighting anything.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.436

-This is raw Brussels sprouts.
-She loves Brussels sprouts.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.624
We need a container of this.
Look how thin they cut it.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.210
See, this is like such an important thing.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.047
If you cut them thin enough,
you can enjoy them raw.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.689
Uh, American cheese.

17:45.773 --> 17:51.612

Kraft Singles or anything like that.

it's best to use art.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.967
It's not vanity, it's self-care,
there's a difference.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.927
What are your skin concerns?

21:44.011 --> 21:47.180
I have these rashy spots,
really hurts when I shave,

21:47.264 --> 21:48.765
I try not to shave too often.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.935
It sounds like
a very common inflammatory condition

21:52.019 --> 21:53.562
called seborrheic dermatitis.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.106
It's worse with people
that have beards.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.109
Shall we take some hair off,
so we can see what's going on?

21:59.192 --> 22:01.903
I think so, after we're done,
we'll examine your face

22:01.987 --> 22:04.197
with skin complexion analysis system.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.202
-Feel nice?
-It does feel pretty good.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.120
[Jonathan] Doesn't it?

22:12.331 --> 22:16.043
Aesthetically, he's got a nice face,
a nice jaw and a nice neck,

22:16.126 --> 22:19.171
and the beard is taking away
the attention from the face.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.923
-It's a big difference already.
-[Jonathan] Right?

22:22.007 --> 22:24.217
-[woman] All right.
-You look amazing.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.469
Follow me.

22:28.263 --> 22:31.725
-I love that lip color on you.
-This is what's on the surface of the skin

22:31.808 --> 22:34.061
-so you do very well here.
-Yeah.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.937
So, you're in the green.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.982
But what we can work on today
with the facial

22:39.066 --> 22:40.400
-would be texture.
-Perfect.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.736
-Let's do it.
-[Jonathan] I wanna show straight men

22:42.819 --> 22:46.239
it's about taking care of yourself.
You're worth making that skin look nice.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.951
-Look at you, gorgeous. How do you feel?
-I feel pretty good.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.204
-Feel a little relaxed?
-Yes, feels good, too.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.705
-It does, right?
-Less itchy.

22:53.789 --> 22:58.168
I've got a major hashtag "transformation

or different ones?

23:04.424 --> 23:05.717
Same one. Shannan.

-Shan-Shan does your hair?
-Yeah.

-Puts on the clippers and goes at it.
-Oh, man.

23:11.264 --> 23:15.560

and even skincare,

23:23.068 --> 23:25.987
it could make you more comfortable.
You'll be looking good

23:26.071 --> 23:28.198
-and you'll know you are approachable.
-Right.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.826
I don't know if I'll be able to keep
my hands off you.

23:30.909 --> 23:31.993

really appreciate Frasier Crane

which I will never understand
and I'm not gonna try.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.308
I'm not even gonna pretend I understand.

You like that he's in a blazer,
he's dressed up, which is great.

28:51.688 --> 28:54.357
This is the green blazer
that you tried on, you liked it.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.484
-I loved it.
-I wanted to find you things

28:56.568 --> 28:58.278
you truly liked so you will wear it.

28:58.361 --> 29:03.116
It means that you can wear jeans
or slacks or chinos.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.910
It's a really good way of dressing up
a simple look

29:05.994 --> 29:07.620
without making any real effort.

What's cool about this little guy,
there's a built-in cooler.

-Nice.
-We have all the stuff that we picked out.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.717
I got you these
Chinese food containers

29:20.800 --> 29:23.928
that are disposable and cute
and a little different.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.056
With all those elements,
we needed one more.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.642
We need one more nice special dish.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.812
Shannan mentioned cauliflower
which she really liked.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.814
Here we have our friend the cauliflower.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.984
We're gonna roast this.
Take a sharp knife like this,

29:38.067 --> 29:40.403
and you make an incision
in the trunk,

29:40.487 --> 29:43.865
and you just crack,
and it's more about crumbling it away,

29:43.948 --> 29:45.950
and the little pieces come off like so.

29:46.534 --> 29:47.952
Once you have these cut,

29:48.953 --> 29:50.789
you grab a bowl, put them in,

29:50.872 --> 29:52.582
dowse them with olive oil,

29:52.665 --> 29:55.126
so that they brown
and they don't stick to the pan.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.670
You're gonna salt them,
they're gonna go in the oven,

29:57.754 --> 30:01.925
375 for 20 to 25 minutes,
and then you flip them

30:02.008 --> 30:05.053
for another five minutes or so
on the other side to get them brown.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.806
And I wanted to pair it
with a really cool,

30:07.889 --> 30:11.351

sexy dipping sauce.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.814
It's a lot of green that we're doing here.

30:16.481 --> 30:20.819
So, we start out, fresh cilantro,
rip it off like so, parsley.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.739
Mm. It's gonna give it
just like a nice freshness.

30:24.906 --> 30:25.949
Green onion.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.868
A really nicely ripe avocado.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.578
That's gonna make it super creamy.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.498
So, we have some jalapeño,
throw that in there.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.084
And those are all our greens.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.045
Awesome. Traditionally,
a green goddess has mayo,

30:39.128 --> 30:43.258
I wanted to go on the lighter side,
so, we're gonna put Greek yogurt.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.634
And now we need some fat.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.678
A surprising amount of olive oil,

30:46.761 --> 30:50.557
otherwise it's just gonna be
a thick paste. Slip it on and pulse.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.146
It's a little dry,
so I'm gonna add some oil.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.991
-Oh, that's amazing.
-Do you like it?

31:08.575 --> 31:11.452
-It's like vegetable candy.
-Vegetable candy.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.372
I'm copyrighting that. That's really good.

-Do you think Shannan's gonna like it?
-She's gonna love it.

31:17.375 --> 31:23.673
We're going to get you all ready, okay?
You're gonna spray in your grooming spray,

31:23.756 --> 31:26.968
then we're gonna round brush your hair,
and then you'll put this in.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.511
-So, let's switch.
-Okay.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.846
Plug in your blow dryer.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.973
Use those dexterous fingers.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.352
What you're gonna do first is
take your round brush,

31:36.436 --> 31:37.937
practice going like this.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.231
That's literally the motion.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.444
There's two ways you can do this.
You can stretch and roll.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.738
See I'm doing that stretching, roll.

31:46.821 --> 31:51.326
Or you can take the section,
roll it up to start, blow dry that.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.911

-Yeah?

31:55.038 --> 31:57.332

Yes! He's doing it.
Work your way forward.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.755
Now take some of the pomade,

32:04.255 --> 32:06.716
start in the back,
work your way forward.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.719
I like how you're getting
underneath.

32:09.802 --> 32:13.056
And let's get it up in the front
a little. Yes.

32:13.139 --> 32:15.975
Start to shape it in the place
where we want it to live.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.685
-Yes.
-Looks good.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.270
This hair looks great.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.356
But if you feel like it falls,

32:21.439 --> 32:23.983
don't be afraid to hit it up
with a little more zhuzh.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.402
You should never be afraid
of a little zhuzh.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.320
All right.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.739
-Isn't my top cute? Are you obsessed?
-It is.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.824
-Do you wish you had one?
-I need one.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.409

through the mesh.
