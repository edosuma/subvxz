WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.169
<i>Previously on</i> legends...
We have a surprise for you.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.505
And an apology.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.440
I'm almost on the platform!

00:08.442 --> 00:10.776
There is no martin odum.
He's a legend.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.011
Who am I?!

00:12.013 --> 00:13.612
You know, the lapd, they found
a couple more witnesses.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.214
Why didn't you tell me
you were there?

00:15.216 --> 00:16.982
Martin: <i>I didn't kill him.</i>
<i>Rice:</i> <i>Who did?</i>

00:16.984 --> 00:19.618
I don't know.
Rice: <i>Were you working</i>
<i>undercover on a case?</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:20.953
(grunting)

00:20.955 --> 00:22.121
Maggie:
<i>Dante auerbach,</i>

00:22.123 --> 00:23.856
<i>British arms dealer.</i>

00:23.858 --> 00:25.391
Lower the gun, ana.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.826
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.029
Nothing's ever gonna be okay.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.463
I will never go back!

00:37.470 --> 00:39.505
Woman: Nice to be back
in your own skin?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.507
Oh, yeah.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.675
A big snug, actually.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.044
You look tired.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.745
Have you been sleeping?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.714
Yeah, here and there.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.883
Was it difficult coming
out of legend this time?

00:51.851 --> 00:53.719
Yeah, of course it was.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.221
Dante lives well.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.891
Nice car, nice clothes.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.860
How do you feel about going
back to martin odum?

01:01.862 --> 01:02.995
How do I feel?

01:02.997 --> 01:04.396
You mean what were my feelings?

01:04.398 --> 01:07.066
When you step back
into your own shoes,

01:07.068 --> 01:08.734
Was there a strong emotion
connected to it?

01:08.736 --> 01:11.003
Were you sad?

01:11.005 --> 01:12.404
Relieved?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.672
Were you angry?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.374
Yeah, um...

01:15.376 --> 01:17.609
Yeah, I was angry.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.545
Really angry.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.879
Because...?

01:20.881 --> 01:22.414
Because I knew
I'd have to answer

01:22.416 --> 01:24.716
Your idiotic questions again.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.251
(chuckles)

01:26.253 --> 01:29.388
Martin, when agents
come out of legend,

01:29.390 --> 01:32.357
They often indicate
signs of extreme stress.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.626
Sometimes that stress
is caused by guilt

01:34.628 --> 01:36.595
They feel about things that
they had to do undercover.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.297
Stress and guilt?

01:38.299 --> 01:40.399
What, you think
I'm indicating all that?

01:40.401 --> 01:41.633
Through your sarcasm...

01:41.635 --> 01:43.268
Yes, I think you are.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.770
What would you know about it?

01:44.772 --> 01:47.606
I've worked
with dco assets for years.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.441
Is that right?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.809
For years?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.411
Yes.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.713
Have you ever done it, then?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.715
Gone under, I mean.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.251
Stepped into a legend.
That's not part of my job.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.420
But you're gonna sit there
and tell me what I'm indicating?

02:01.422 --> 02:03.288
You, who's never done shit.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.057
Who's never been
in a tight spot?

02:05.059 --> 02:06.425
Martin, I'm here to help you.
How are you gonna help me

02:06.427 --> 02:08.227
When you don't know
what you're talking about?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.895
I can listen.
You can explain.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.263
We can talk it through...
Oh, and we'll have a good cry

02:11.265 --> 02:13.532
At the end, yeah?
Stop wasting my time.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.268
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.870
Write that down.
Gone mental.

02:18.738 --> 02:19.638
Martin:
Oh.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.440
Quite an outfit you run here.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.976
Tell you that much.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.578
People who don't do it
tell people like me

02:26.580 --> 02:28.113
Who do, how to do it.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.414
(laughing)

02:29.416 --> 02:31.617
I mean, that doesn't, uh,

02:31.619 --> 02:35.354
Exactly instill a lot of, uh,
a lot of trust, does it?

02:36.789 --> 02:38.824
Do you trust yourself?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.627
Do you feel like your legends
change who you are?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.295
Boy, you're giving me
a right bloody headache.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.329
Do you know that?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.697
What are you scared of, martin?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.332
What, am I indicating fear now?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.433
You tell me.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.468
No, actually.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.602
I'm indicating, uh,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.204
Shove it up your ass.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.519
That looked fun.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.388
I'll send you my report
this afternoon.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.856
Where's chief gates?

03:10.858 --> 03:13.025
He's in washington for
subcommittee meetings this week.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.560
It's my call.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.361
What's the verdict
on martin?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.697
He's hostile, unstable.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.032
I cannot recommend

03:20.034 --> 03:22.000
He go back to active duty.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.469
I know this was
a difficult case, agent mcguire,

03:24.471 --> 03:26.138
<i>But martin's had to deal</i>
<i>with major trauma</i>

03:26.140 --> 03:27.472
<i>In the field before.</i>

03:27.474 --> 03:29.308
I think this is something else.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.678
<i>Whatever he's dealing with,</i>
<i>it's not about what he did</i>

03:32.680 --> 03:35.013
<i>As dante auerbach or any other</i>
<i>legend, for that matter.</i>

03:35.015 --> 03:38.217
<i>He's struggling with having</i>
<i>to be martin odum again.</i>

03:38.219 --> 03:39.685
Sonya:
<i>And then you show up</i>

03:39.687 --> 03:41.720
<i>And you don't even know</i>
<i>who you are half the time.</i>

03:41.722 --> 03:43.388
Martin: <i>People died today</i>
<i>because I misread the time.</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:45.224
<i>I'm not who I think I am.</i>
<i>Man:</i> <i>Welcome home, mr. Auerbach.</i>

03:45.226 --> 03:47.025
Martin: <i>I'm not</i>
<i>who I think I am.</i>

03:47.027 --> 03:48.560
Mccombs:
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>

03:48.562 --> 03:50.062
Martin: <i>Auerbach...</i>
<i>Mccombs:</i> <i>He doesn't exist!</i>

03:50.064 --> 03:52.130
Martin:
<i>I'm not who I think I am.</i>
<i>Who am I?!</i>

04:14.120 --> 04:15.621
("breath of space"
by break science plays)

04:34.874 --> 04:37.309
Don't tell me
your date's a no-show.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.544
How you doing tonight?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.418
Tony.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.886
Crys.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.922
You want to buy me a drink?
(chuckles)

04:50.924 --> 04:52.924
I'm married, crys.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.960
Take the night off.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.029
(laughs)

04:58.598 --> 05:01.066
What?

05:01.068 --> 05:03.101
Uh...

05:03.103 --> 05:06.138
You're gonna be mad at me
when I tell you.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.307
Crys, come on, agent mcguire,
just let me explain...

05:08.309 --> 05:11.143
No. You should've identified
yourself first, asshole!

05:11.145 --> 05:12.678
Just have a couple of questions
to ask you.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.845
Did you follow me here?

05:13.847 --> 05:14.946
Couldn't approach you at work.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.214
It's about martin odum.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.452
You have about two minutes
till the valet brings my car.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.586
This is an eyewitness

05:21.588 --> 05:23.989
Video of the murder
of a homeless man--

05:23.991 --> 05:25.524
Robert mccombs.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.159
And that's your agent--
martin odum

05:27.161 --> 05:29.227
Standing over him.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.465
So, you think
martin killed this guy?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.801
I did. Then another
witness told me

05:35.803 --> 05:38.303
That a woman from the crowd
did it then and walked away.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.105
Odum steps up right after her.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.507
So, interview martin.
See what he has to say.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.709
I already did.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.043
And what he had to say

05:45.045 --> 05:46.611
Was a big old lie
about being there.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.779
And that raised one eyebrow.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.382
Then chief gates
came to my house

05:50.384 --> 05:53.819
To tell me to drop the case.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.954
That's the same look I had.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.197
(knocking at door)

06:07.400 --> 06:08.734
Who is it?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.001
Sonya.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.070
I brought dinner.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.241
Hi.
Hey.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.843
The guy downstairs
knew your order,

06:17.845 --> 06:20.011
But I got a few extra things,
just in case.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.380
I know I should've called.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.148
I feel bad how we ended
things the other night.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.549
Are you in the middle
of something?

06:24.551 --> 06:25.851
(laughs):
No.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.052
No. I'm sorry.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.087
Come in. I'm glad you came.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.033
Where'd you get the piano?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.770
Someone left it behind.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.372
Too big to move, I guess.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.840
That's why I took
the apartment.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.009
That... And the view.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.778
Mm.
(chuckles)

06:52.780 --> 06:56.081
Yeah, those two things and then
I think you're out of reasons.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.283
Well, it's cheap.

06:58.285 --> 07:01.019
Close to you guys.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.188
I'm teaching myself
to play, actually.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.423
Really?
Mm-hmm.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.958
Play me something.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.627
I don't think so.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.363
(laughs)
not yet. (laughs)

07:11.365 --> 07:12.697
(chuckles)

07:18.638 --> 07:22.307
The last time I saw you, you
said you were having trouble.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.778
Yeah, I've, uh, I've started
to see someone about that.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.914
You're seeing a shrink?

07:28.916 --> 07:31.283
Yeah. It's good.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.452
Good for you.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.057
I'm taking some time off,
actually.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.228
You look tired.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.497
Yeah, I've not been
sleeping much.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.467
Don't want to, really.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.603
Been having these...
These dreams.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.338
What about the memory stuff?

07:53.340 --> 07:56.441
Well, it's scary...

07:56.443 --> 07:57.843
To have these
blank spots.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.479
And they're
getting bigger.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.281
I've just got this fear
that one day I'm...

08:03.283 --> 08:06.818
I'm gonna wake up
and not know my own name.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.120
I know your name.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.990
It's martin
macdonald odum.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.427
Tough guy.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.663
Who stops bad guys.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.868
Yeah.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.238
(chuckles):
No. No more for me.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.842
You don't have to
leave yet, do you?

08:30.844 --> 08:34.513
No. But I know what
you're doing, martin.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.448
Yeah? What am I doing?

08:36.450 --> 08:37.849
(both laughing)

08:41.120 --> 08:43.321
Well, I've got all
sorts of scars

08:43.323 --> 08:44.556
All over my body.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.124
Haven't got a clue
where they came from.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.126
I can't believe
you don't remember.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.028
We've been
over this, martin.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.465
You were in a car accident.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.500
Drunk driver,
they think.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.537
Hit-and-run.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.540
They had to cut you
out of the wreck.

09:01.542 --> 09:05.176
You were in the hospital
three weeks, in a coma.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.279
And when you woke up...

09:08.648 --> 09:10.382
...You didn't remember much.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.418
Not even me.
When was it?

09:13.420 --> 09:15.754
February 2004.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.790
They ever find the driver?

09:19.759 --> 09:22.160
No. They didn't.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.935
It's late.
I've got to go.

09:55.461 --> 09:56.761
(car crashing, siren wailing)

09:56.763 --> 09:57.896
Sonya:
<i>I know your name.</i>

09:57.898 --> 09:59.965
<i>It's martin macdonald odum.</i>

09:59.967 --> 10:01.733
Mccombs:
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>

10:01.735 --> 10:03.468
<i>Trust no one.</i>
<i>Sonya:</i>
<i>You don't remember?</i>

10:03.470 --> 10:05.570
<i>You were in a car accident.</i>

10:05.572 --> 10:06.905
Mccombs:
<i>They don't want you</i>
<i>to know the truth.</i>

10:06.907 --> 10:08.873
<i>They don't want you to know</i>

10:08.875 --> 10:09.874
Who you are.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.410
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>

10:12.412 --> 10:14.546
<i>He's a legend.</i>
<i>Martin:</i> <i>I'm not</i>
<i>who I think I am.</i>

10:14.548 --> 10:16.915
(gun cocks)

10:16.917 --> 10:19.651
Mccombs:
<i>Everything about him is fake.</i>
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>

10:19.653 --> 10:21.586
Martin:
<i>I'm not who I think I am.</i>

10:21.588 --> 10:24.155
Mccombs:
<i>He doesn't exist.</i>
<i>There's a book</i>

10:24.157 --> 10:26.825
In the left pocket--
the answer's in there...

10:26.827 --> 10:28.627
<i>The answer's in there.</i>

10:48.514 --> 10:50.782
Maggie. Yeah, it's me, martin.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.685
<i>Can you do me a favor?</i>
<i>Write these numbers down.</i>

10:53.687 --> 10:55.186
<i>Two, zero, three...</i>

10:55.188 --> 10:57.188
<i>Seven, six, nine...</i>

10:57.190 --> 11:00.458
<i>Eight, one, eight, five.</i>

11:00.460 --> 11:02.327
I don't know.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.663
<i>Hoping you could tell me.</i>

11:16.542 --> 11:18.610
(siren wails in distance)

11:29.522 --> 11:33.291
Martin didn't tell me
anything about this.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.293
Was mccombs part
of an active

11:35.295 --> 11:36.728
Dc operation?
Not to my knowledge.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.397
Then martin odum was
mixed up in a homicide.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.167
And chief gates is
covering for him.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.802
Now, you want to tell me why?
You're crazy.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.137
Listen, hey, hold on,
now, I-I understand

11:46.139 --> 11:48.740
The conflicting loyalties,
okay? I get that.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.209
But just consider this:

11:51.211 --> 11:53.478
Right before
mccombs got stabbed,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.847
All the surveillance cameras
went static--

11:55.849 --> 11:57.849
Synchronized
electronic interference,

11:57.851 --> 11:58.883
High-emitter frequency.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.352
Now, this is
state-of-the-art tech.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.521
What does that tell you?

12:03.523 --> 12:05.023
It was a hit.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.357
From a pro.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.759
Could it be anything else?

12:07.761 --> 12:10.061
What was mccombs into?
Far as I can tell,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.997
Just dumpster diving,
drinking, some panhandling.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.935
There had to be a reason
why someone wanted him dead.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.070
Exactly.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.173
I was gonna head over
to veterans affairs,

12:22.175 --> 12:24.476
See if I can get a look
at mccombs' psych file.

12:26.679 --> 12:27.946
All right.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.748
Let's go.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.089
Hi.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.357
Hey.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.558
How are you?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.793
You look rough.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.195
Yeah. Feel it.
(chuckles)

12:44.197 --> 12:47.265
Listen, uh, thanks for meeting
me outside the office like this.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.433
Yeah.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.469
How's leave?
Been hitting the beach,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.638
Boozin' it up?
What you been doing?

12:53.640 --> 12:56.040
Aw, I just
sit around all day.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.709
Listen to my own
wheels spinning.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.611
I ran the number sequence.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.413
Yeah? And-- anything?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.315
I'm gonna give you
the short version.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.151
Okay...

13:06.153 --> 13:08.253
Cryptanalysis
came up zero; gps,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.255
Social security number,
ip address--

13:10.257 --> 13:12.323
None of those matched up--
then I remembered this guy

13:12.325 --> 13:13.725
That I dated last year who

13:13.727 --> 13:15.493
Worked for the nsa,
and he was so

13:15.495 --> 13:16.895
Into the modern
surveillance state,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.396
And how great
it would be for society

13:18.398 --> 13:20.598
And there'd be,
like, no crime...
Yes.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.800
Nightmare. You know.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.802
Not simpatico at all.
Maggie...

13:25.104 --> 13:28.173
Sorry. Uh, all of that
got me thinking,

13:28.175 --> 13:30.475
And I'm a little embarrassed,

13:30.477 --> 13:33.912
'cause it's kind of obvious,
but...

13:33.914 --> 13:35.847
Ten numbers.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.348
It's a phone number.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.118
Yeah. Might have been why
he dog-eared the pages--

13:40.120 --> 13:41.953
In case he forgot it.
Yeah.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.121
Don't bother.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.423
I already called it,
and it went

13:45.425 --> 13:47.492
To a private voice mail.
I didn't leave a message

13:47.494 --> 13:49.194
Or anything,
but there's no greeting,

13:49.196 --> 13:50.495
Just a beep.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.598
Any chance you could find who
that voice mail belongs to?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.101
Hmm... Since it bills
through the phone company,

13:57.103 --> 13:59.871
You have to have a name
and address to open an account.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.876
Guy's name is dennis evans.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.348
You know,
you got to be careful, maggie.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.383
You gotta cover your tracks,
do you understand?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.786
Don't tell anyone about this.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.287
If you get caught, you could...

14:16.289 --> 14:17.722
Lose my job, I know.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.724
Or you could lose your life.

14:24.396 --> 14:27.232
I'm being careful.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.169
Why don't you just
tell me what's going on?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.304
I-I've got a lead on a case.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.708
I can't say
what it is yet, but...

14:36.710 --> 14:38.743
I think it's significant.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.648
And the less you know...

14:43.650 --> 14:46.484
The safer you are.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.354
That's fine.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.022
You need to tell gates.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.690
Yeah, when
the time's right.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.760
I'm not on active duty
and, given my present status...

14:55.762 --> 14:58.029
"doghouse" is the designation.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.530
Yeah.
I'd rather

14:59.532 --> 15:02.166
Put the case together first.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.668
You know?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.970
Beg for forgiveness later.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.676
Dennis evans, huh?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.244
His address is
on the back.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.946
He vibes total
shut-in.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.016
<i>He lives on disability</i>
<i>from a truck driving job.</i>

15:30.129 --> 15:31.629
Dennis evans?

15:31.631 --> 15:34.032
I'm martin odum; fbi.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.767
What do you want?

15:35.769 --> 15:38.870
I was hoping to ask you some
questions about robert mccombs.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.205
No, uh, no comment
on that one, boss.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.974
What, do you know him?

15:42.976 --> 15:45.610
Not talking to nobody.
Well, I just need
a couple of minutes.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.046
Stay the hell
away from me.

15:51.417 --> 15:55.253
Please don't kill me, man!
Please don't kill me! Please...
How do you know mccombs?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.822
How do you know mccombs?
Don't start with that. If you're
gonna do it, just do it.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.324
Who do you think I am?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.492
Man, why are you
trying to torture me?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.129
I'm not gonna hurt you.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.266
I just want
some answers, all right?

16:08.268 --> 16:11.135
All right?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.337
Wait, what's your name again?

16:12.339 --> 16:13.871
Martin odum.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.475
No. No, your real name.

16:18.744 --> 16:19.911
That <i>is</i> my real name.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.679
No.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.414
No, it's not.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.952
I know you, man.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.187
I know you.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.488
You're in the photo.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.824
What photo?

16:32.826 --> 16:35.293
Sorry about that whole
hatchet thing.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.595
I thought you were
misrepresenting yourself.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.097
Were you scared
I was gonna kill you?

16:39.099 --> 16:42.500
I know ptsd does that
paranoia thing, but, uh,

16:42.502 --> 16:43.668
You still
can't be too careful.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.504
I'm telling you,
you're in this photo.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.606
If I could ever find it.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.342
Who's after you?

16:51.344 --> 16:54.012
I don't know. I mean,
I don't know who they are,

16:54.014 --> 16:55.947
But I know they're watching me.
Even tried to kill me

16:55.949 --> 16:57.949
A couple of times-- that's
why I'm living off the grid.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.751
Least I thought I was.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.022
Ah. Here. Here it is.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.690
Look.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.158
There you are.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.560
There's mccombs.
And there's me.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.166
Where was this picture taken?

17:15.168 --> 17:16.634
I was hoping
you could tell me.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.803
I don't know.
Someplace in iraq, I think.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.505
No.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.040
I was never in iraq.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.142
Yes, you were.
Yes, you were.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.977
There you are,
man, right there.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.047
And-and it's time stamped
right on the back.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.848
February, 2004.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.551
Sonya (overlapping):
<i>You were in a car accident.</i>

17:33.553 --> 17:34.919
<i>Hit and run.</i>
<i>You don't remember?</i>

17:34.921 --> 17:37.055
<i>One driver, they think...</i>
<i>February, 2004...</i>

17:37.057 --> 17:38.489
This-this must have been
manipulated somehow,

17:38.491 --> 17:42.427
'cause I was never there.
Never there.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.029
You can't remember... You can't
remember, I can't remember,

17:45.031 --> 17:46.497
Mccombs couldn't
remember.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.166
See, we all got
the same thing.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.600
They did something to
us over there, man.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.169
I don't know,
they-they-they

17:51.171 --> 17:52.670
Scrambled our brains
or something.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.772
They put, uh,
microchips in our teeth.

17:54.774 --> 17:55.840
That's paranoid nonsense.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.043
Is it?! They want us dead.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.913
They want us dead. That is why
they're hunting us down.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.681
Right? So they can
cover up whatever

18:03.683 --> 18:04.782
They did to us over there.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.019
I am telling you--
don't trust anyone.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.620
Trust no one.
Trust no one.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.323
<i>No one.</i>
<i>No one.</i>

18:13.459 --> 18:14.725
Tell me about mccombs.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.960
I don't know,
mccombs,

18:15.962 --> 18:18.963
He-he found me when
his symptoms started to show up.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.300
And we tried to get some
answers, but we just hit walls.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.969
I am telling you, there is some
kind of cover up going on.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.938
And it goes
to the top, man.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.539
To the top.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.942
Have you spoken to anyone else
in this photo?

18:30.944 --> 18:31.976
They're all dead.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.811
I thought it was just
mccombs and me left,

18:33.813 --> 18:35.480
Till you show up--
now there's three of us.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.883
No, there's still two.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.485
Mccombs is dead now.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.320
They got him?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.922
They got him...
He got too exposed.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.892
I gotta get the hell out of
here, man; I gotta disappear.

18:49.428 --> 18:50.795
Wait...

18:52.831 --> 18:54.132
Oh.
What is it?

18:54.134 --> 18:55.333
Oh, oh.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.601
Wait.
What is it?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.169
There's-there's this guy,
this guy that...

18:58.171 --> 18:59.403
Mccombs was looking for.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.805
This guy mccombs
was looking for.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.106
I wrote his name
down here.

19:02.108 --> 19:05.643
Maybe the fbi can...
Can track him down.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.945
This guy-- kyle dobson.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.914
This guy knows what
happened to us over there.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.250
He was in charge
over there.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.018
Where he is now?

19:14.020 --> 19:15.186
I don't know.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.854
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.257
I wouldn't touch that guy
with a ten-foot pole.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.925
I mean, this guy
probably killed mccombs.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.766
This issue is doctor-patient
confidentiality.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.003
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
about the treatment we provided

19:32.005 --> 19:34.005
For mr. Mccombs.
This is an active investigation,

19:34.007 --> 19:36.774
Dr. Brooks;
robert mccombs no longer

19:36.776 --> 19:38.109
Has anything to protect.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.343
He's dead.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.378
Well, I'm sorry

19:40.380 --> 19:41.646
To hear that.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.481
Still doesn't change anything.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.816
So you're gonna
make us get a subpoena?
Life's tough.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.885
Yeah.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.954
Yeah, it is, so...
Tell me, how many

19:49.956 --> 19:52.256
Oxy scrips
you writing these days?

19:53.892 --> 19:56.194
I... Couldn't say.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.329
Why?
Well, I know that oxy abuse

19:58.331 --> 19:59.497
Is a huge problem.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.865
And you know what
the dea says, right?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.633
Trust, but verify.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.834
Are you threatening me?

20:03.836 --> 20:06.170
No, no, of course not.
I would never do that.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.406
Just call it
persuasive authority.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.474
We'll keep it between us.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.343
Mccombs:
<i>No! No, no.</i>

20:12.345 --> 20:15.012
You think you know.
But you don't <i>know,</i> man.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.681
You only think you know,
but it's a...

20:16.683 --> 20:19.350
It's a tragedy of war.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.018
It chews you up.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.688
You go to iraq, they
don't care what happens to us.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.089
He was diagnosed with

20:25.091 --> 20:26.691
A dissociative identity
disorder.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.226
Is that like
a split personality?

20:28.228 --> 20:31.562
Similar.
More like he... Lost himself,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.197
Forgot who he was.
When he came back

20:33.199 --> 20:35.166
From iraq he had
severe ptsd:

20:35.168 --> 20:38.002
Insomnia, night terrors,
paranoia, memory loss.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.937
I told evans, I told evans,
I told evans...

20:39.939 --> 20:41.072
He needs to take cover.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.074
Evans-- do you know who that is?

20:43.076 --> 20:44.942
He was a friend
of mccombs' from iraq.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.344
Came in to visit him here once.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.513
His first name
was... Dennis.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.019
It was raining fire.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.690
I saw a whole world burn.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.795
(screaming)

21:09.268 --> 21:10.434
What's that saying?
"just because you're paranoid

21:10.436 --> 21:11.702
Doesn't mean they're
not out to get you"?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.638
Well played back there.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.906
How'd you know the doctor
was overprescribing?

21:15.908 --> 21:17.575
Rolled the dice,
played the odds.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.377
So you just got lucky.
No, no luck.

21:19.379 --> 21:23.047
Skill. Masterful skill.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.283
So, where did you
pick up these skills?

21:25.285 --> 21:27.885
I was with lapd homicide
before I joined the bureau.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.120
You know, the real police.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.122
Mm, I get it.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.124
You're one
of those reverse snobs,

21:33.126 --> 21:35.493
Down on anybody who came up
through the academy.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.996
You think we had it easy.
Well, facts being
what they are...

21:38.998 --> 21:41.932
Pretty much.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.802
Dco's a little different.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.806
Maggie: Kyle dobson
is wanted by interpol,

21:48.808 --> 21:51.075
But the file is sealed--
there's no access

21:51.077 --> 21:52.977
Without gates'
authorization.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.745
(sighing):
I want some duck rolls.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.147
Where did the waiter go?

21:56.149 --> 21:58.616
He just disappeared.

21:58.618 --> 22:02.153
Dobson was in
iraq from 2003

22:02.155 --> 22:03.421
To 2006.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.424
With a private military
contractor named verex,

22:06.426 --> 22:08.326
Where he was under scrutiny
for unaccounted money,

22:08.328 --> 22:09.593
Missing weapons,

22:09.595 --> 22:11.829
Even some rugs
from saddam's palace,

22:11.831 --> 22:13.297
But the investigations
went nowhere.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.666
Where is he now?
Houston.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.036
Local pd has dobson pegged as
a suspect in a smuggling ring.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.072
They can't find him.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.374
What's wrong?

22:23.376 --> 22:24.775
Did you use
the computers at dco?

22:24.777 --> 22:26.610
Did you cover your tracks
like I said?

22:26.612 --> 22:29.347
Of course.
'cause I don't want any of this
coming back on you--

22:29.349 --> 22:30.848
Not from gates,
not from anyone else.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.717
I got it, martin.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.188
Well, I don't mean to be harsh.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.689
I'm a big girl.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.758
Okay? I know what I'm doing.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.863
That's how I was able
to find this.

22:46.832 --> 22:47.965
What is it?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.533
Found it
in his iraq file.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.068
Whole thing's
been scrubbed.

22:51.070 --> 22:54.305
But I did manage to trace
the serial number on the file.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.840
It's from
the defense department.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.309
Something called
operation raining fire.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.415
Man: Take cover!
(shouting, explosions)

23:05.751 --> 23:07.051
Martin?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.755
You ever heard of it?

23:10.757 --> 23:13.924
Maggie, I need you
to get me on a plane

23:13.926 --> 23:15.526
To houston this afternoon.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.162
Why, 'cause you're gonna
go after dobson and-and what?

23:18.164 --> 23:21.198
I'm your travel agent?
Please.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.001
Please, look, just do
your computer thing, yeah?

23:24.003 --> 23:26.036
Book the ticket

23:26.038 --> 23:29.106
Under the name of len barlow.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.075
Len barlow.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.244
He's a legend?

23:33.246 --> 23:35.346
Yeah, in more ways than one.

23:35.348 --> 23:38.182
Martin, you know going solo
on this is crazy.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.519
(sighs)

23:41.521 --> 23:44.722
Okay... Tell me about him.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.924
Back-fill
his record history.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.726
Let me help.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.262
Len's a cowboy.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.031
Born a century and a half
too late.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.934
<i>Raised in midland.</i>

23:56.936 --> 23:59.870
<i>Father worked the oil rigs,</i>
<i>mother left him--</i>

23:59.872 --> 24:01.806
<i>Walked out on him</i>
<i>when he was seven.</i>

24:01.808 --> 24:04.475
<i>His life was about</i>
<i>taking what he could get.</i>

24:04.477 --> 24:05.910
<i>And he liked</i>
<i>playing the outlaw.</i>

24:05.912 --> 24:07.144
He did a dime

24:07.146 --> 24:08.446
In prison for
armed robbery.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.414
But he learned to do better.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.383
Okay, I'll give len
a long criminal record.

24:12.385 --> 24:14.251
Juvie to county
to state prisons,

24:14.253 --> 24:15.786
Probation and parole officers.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.954
Martin:
<i>Prison was grad school.</i>

24:16.956 --> 24:19.123
<i>Taught how to crack safes,</i>
<i>got out,</i>

24:19.125 --> 24:21.292
<i>Started taking down scores.</i>

24:21.294 --> 24:22.960
<i>He did well for himself.</i>

24:22.962 --> 24:25.963
(southern accent):
Cops called me an east texas
<i>contrabando.</i>

24:31.069 --> 24:33.103
Hey!

24:33.105 --> 24:34.472
<i>I got a another</i>
<i>reputation, too.</i>

24:34.474 --> 24:37.308
Let's just say
I never lost a gunfight

24:37.310 --> 24:39.410
For lack of shootin'.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.657
So mccombs comes back
from iraq ptsd,

24:53.659 --> 24:55.926
Loses touch with reality,
and ends up dead.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.962
Well, his murder definitely
wasn't an accident.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.030
Neither is martin's involvement.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.366
You're taking some big leaps.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.702
Are you sure the fact that you
two had a relationship isn't

25:04.704 --> 25:05.936
Clouding your
objectivity?

25:05.938 --> 25:08.105
Who said we had a relationship?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.773
I am good at my job.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.842
That's who said.
Not <i>that</i> good, tony.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.611
'cause I don't do relationships.

25:14.613 --> 25:16.213
Mr. Evans?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.616
Please open up. Fbi.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.886
I'm gonna go check
around the back.

25:31.396 --> 25:33.130
Shh.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.532
(quietly):
We got a break-in.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.074
(door creaks)

26:00.225 --> 26:01.926
Crystal.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.105
Oh, god.

26:18.209 --> 26:20.911
What the hell is going on here?

26:30.956 --> 26:33.457
(fast-tempo
country rock playing)

26:38.263 --> 26:41.131
â™ª I can't settle on sunshine

26:41.133 --> 26:44.068
â™ª I can't take all the heat...

26:44.070 --> 26:45.636
Shoot, man!

26:45.638 --> 26:47.705
Thought I was
done with you.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.073
How long has it been, chang?

26:49.075 --> 26:51.308
Since you last sweat me?

26:51.310 --> 26:53.444
Boot on neck?

26:53.446 --> 26:55.546
(laughs):
Two years, at least.

26:55.548 --> 26:57.615
Bartender.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.017
Bourbon for my friend.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.121
How are you these days?

27:04.123 --> 27:06.657
I'm being goat-raped,
that's how I am.
(chuckles)

27:06.659 --> 27:08.592
These guys I'm dealing with--
zero integrity.

27:08.594 --> 27:11.261
We had a deal--
I cover their stuff at the port,

27:11.263 --> 27:13.230
Make sure they get their stuff
through customs,

27:13.232 --> 27:14.832
And I get the heisman
on the kickback.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.967
Well, just sounds
like bad business.
It's stupid.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.371
To alienate a partner--
builds up resentment.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.941
Wait. You're here.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.776
Which means you
want something.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.779
Have you ever heard of a guy
called kyle dobson?

27:28.781 --> 27:30.848
Dobson?

27:30.850 --> 27:33.083
Dobson's a bad dude.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.485
You know him?

27:34.487 --> 27:36.286
Like I know dahmer
or ken skilling--

27:36.288 --> 27:37.488
Just by reputation.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.756
What's his business?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.357
Import-export.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.861
I hear he runs a lot of weight
for the sinaloa cartel.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.964
It's too bad you
don't know him personally.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.133
Too bad?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.601
Yeah, it's disappointing.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.202
Here it comes.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.871
Boot on neck.
Look,

27:53.873 --> 27:56.707
You run your little scams
down here and make your bones.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.975
Now I'm here.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.044
I can either look
the other way,

28:00.046 --> 28:03.047
Or I can run you in.
I thought we were
friends, man.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.716
Look, the deal was, you stay
on top of things down here.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.051
It's the fourth largest city
in the country.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.553
You want to be a ci
or a fish at lompoc?

28:09.555 --> 28:12.156
You need to deliver--
that's how it works.

28:12.158 --> 28:15.526
This dobson... He's the kind
of guy you're supposed to know.

28:15.528 --> 28:18.862
I'm sorry, paulie, I'm gonna
have to call in a chit.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.230
Man...

28:20.232 --> 28:22.533
I don't know dobson.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.802
(sighs)

28:24.804 --> 28:27.171
I might know
one of his girlfriends.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.806
She goes to karaoke night
at the copper bucket.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.574
Yeah, I'm listening.

28:30.576 --> 28:33.677
That's what you're gonna do,
go in through the girl?

28:33.679 --> 28:35.512
You're not her type.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.148
I'll bet I know a guy who is.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.651
She likes big hats,
man, not redcoats.

28:40.653 --> 28:42.753
She'll like len barlow.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.427
Rice:
<i>So mccombs, and now</i>

28:50.429 --> 28:52.663
Evans were both killed by pros.

28:52.665 --> 28:55.399
And the only connection
we have to 'em is...

28:55.401 --> 28:57.468
Martin odum.

28:59.704 --> 29:01.705
What is it?
Did anything turn up?

29:01.707 --> 29:03.941
I ran the phone history
for evans.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.076
I didn't find anything useful.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.445
It doesn't look like
he used the phone that much.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.880
He was hiding.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.615
His internet
was also run through

29:11.617 --> 29:13.550
Proxy servers,
so it makes sense.

29:13.552 --> 29:14.685
I'll keep digging

29:14.687 --> 29:17.287
And see if I can
follow that trail.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.622
Have you heard from martin?

29:18.624 --> 29:21.191
No. Why? Was I supposed to?

29:21.193 --> 29:24.061
No. But he's not
answering his phone.

29:24.063 --> 29:27.364
That's it. Thank you.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.633
I think it's
time we talked

29:29.635 --> 29:31.135
To martin directly.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.774
So, your plan is to just
ask him what's going on?

29:36.776 --> 29:39.276
Yep.
And you think he's
just gonna tell you?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.545
There's no reason
for him not to.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.650
Martin?

29:48.119 --> 29:49.953
(knocking)

29:49.955 --> 29:51.488
What are you doing?

29:51.490 --> 29:53.290
I'm seizing the
opportunity.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.392
We're not breaking in
to his apartment.
You're right,

29:55.394 --> 29:57.628
We're not breaking in
to his apartment.

29:58.563 --> 30:00.330
I am.

30:03.001 --> 30:05.803
Martin?

30:05.805 --> 30:08.939
This guy needs a maid.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.508
And an ikea catalog.

30:34.632 --> 30:35.966
Does the name len barlow

30:35.968 --> 30:39.436
Mean anything
to you?
Rice.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.272
Find something?
Len barlow is
one of his legends.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.675
He's gone rogue.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.185
Woman: â™ª don't come home
a-drinkin' â™ª

30:55.187 --> 30:58.555
â™ª with lovin' on your mind

30:58.557 --> 31:01.458
â™ª don't come home a-drinkin'

31:01.460 --> 31:03.527
â™ª with lovin' on your mind...

31:03.529 --> 31:04.728
Which one is she?

31:04.730 --> 31:06.230
Dobson's girlfriend?

31:06.232 --> 31:08.799
You get one guess.

31:08.801 --> 31:11.034
I got to tell you, man,
this is a dangerous thing to do.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.037
You bark up that tree,
you don't walk out of here.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.173
(southern accent):
Got to get the big dog

31:16.175 --> 31:19.042
Out from under
the porch.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.550
You sing even better
than you look.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.318
And that's
saying something.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.419
Hey.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.188
Nothin' up my sleeve.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.956
Just being friendly.

31:35.426 --> 31:37.327
Buy you another tequila?

31:37.329 --> 31:39.997
I don't think my boyfriend
would like that too much.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.899
What he don't know
won't hurt him.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.333
(chuckles)

31:43.335 --> 31:46.370
He finds out, he'll hurt you.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.772
I won't tell if you won't.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.109
(chuckles)

31:52.111 --> 31:53.443
I'm len.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.014
Mind wrangling a couple
of don julio aÃ±ejos for us?

31:57.016 --> 31:59.082
Appreciate it.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.218
You're pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

32:01.220 --> 32:03.654
Someone's got to be.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.526
To us and to others like us.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.867
Hey, tara,
you're up next.

32:16.869 --> 32:17.968
I just sang.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.870
Man:
Well, it's time
for an encore.

32:19.872 --> 32:23.040
Why don't you let her decide
if she wants to karaoke or not.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.207
Why don't you shut your mouth.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.976
You think
I'm gonna sit quiet here

32:25.978 --> 32:28.578
And listen to your aspersions,
you got another one comin'.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.547
I'm hardheaded that way.

32:30.549 --> 32:33.617
You see these big
bastards up by the stage?

32:34.319 --> 32:35.886
All I got to do

32:35.888 --> 32:37.888
Is whistle and they're
gonna charge over here

32:37.890 --> 32:39.623
And start stompin'.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.224
Don't whistle, then.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.159
(chuckles)

32:42.161 --> 32:43.994
Now...

32:45.630 --> 32:47.331
...If that's sorted out,
I'd like to finish

32:47.333 --> 32:49.733
My conversation
with the young lady here.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.401
Your name again?

32:51.403 --> 32:52.803
Tara.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.205
You are hardheaded, aren't you?

32:58.776 --> 33:02.045
Turn me loose or lose your hand.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.100
You're with him?

33:23.102 --> 33:24.935
A friend of his.

33:24.937 --> 33:28.372
That boyfriend
I was telling you about.
Well...

33:28.374 --> 33:31.441
He's a lucky guy.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.654
(laughing):
Oh, my god.

33:44.656 --> 33:45.889
That was damn close.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.125
Wow. C-hair close.
Those guys are animals.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.459
Wasn't that close.

33:49.461 --> 33:52.462
Still had some ways to go
before we got into it.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.131
You know, I like you
with this texas thing.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.732
It's bona fide, for real.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.835
Hey, martin-- len--

33:58.837 --> 34:01.304
Think I'm gonna bounce,
go hide for a few months.

34:01.306 --> 34:02.305
We're good though, right?

34:02.307 --> 34:03.740
Debt to society paid?

34:03.742 --> 34:05.809
We're good.

34:08.546 --> 34:10.547
(country music playing)

34:10.549 --> 34:12.916
Check.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.684
Tara, if you can help it,

34:14.686 --> 34:17.087
Try not to blow any strangers
on the way home.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.755
Then you better drive me.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.824
(men guffawing)

34:22.060 --> 34:24.127
(phone ringing)

34:29.367 --> 34:31.868
Sonya, you okay?

34:31.870 --> 34:33.570
Yeah. I'm fine.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.439
I just called to say hi.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.707
Not a good time to talk?
Depends on
who walks out the door

34:37.709 --> 34:38.909
I'm looking at.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.410
You at work right now?

34:40.412 --> 34:42.446
Pardon?
Are you working?

34:42.448 --> 34:45.215
I stopped by your apartment last
night, but you weren't there.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.418
I'm in houston.
Uh, fbi conference.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.954
How'd you sleep?
No nightmares, I hope.

34:50.956 --> 34:54.224
No.
Good. Listen, I just wanted
to say how nice it was

34:54.226 --> 34:56.126
To talk again.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.195
It felt like old times.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.463
I've missed that.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.098
Yeah.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.599
Yeah, I've missed it, too.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.800
I'm gonna have to get you

35:03.802 --> 35:05.635
To play the piano
for me sometime.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.971
(sonya chuckles)

35:09.073 --> 35:12.776
Can I ask you a question?

35:12.778 --> 35:14.744
February 2004.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.247
Are you sure that's when I had
my car accident?

35:17.249 --> 35:18.882
Of course I'm sure.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.084
That valentine's day, you...

35:21.086 --> 35:22.953
Were supposed to take me
to hawaii.

35:22.955 --> 35:25.422
Evans: <i>There you are, man.</i>
<i>Right there.</i>

35:25.424 --> 35:28.658
Martin: <i>I was never in iraq.</i>
<i>Evans:</i>
<i>And it's time-stamped 2004.</i>

35:28.660 --> 35:30.160
You don't remember?

35:30.162 --> 35:31.628
No, I do.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.065
I was just wondering if it was
that year or the year before.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.766
(woman laughs, man talking)

35:36.768 --> 35:38.768
Listen, can I give you a call
when I get back?

35:38.770 --> 35:40.070
It'll only be a few days.

35:40.072 --> 35:41.071
Okay.

35:41.073 --> 35:42.439
Give aiden a hug.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.907
Walk straight.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.443
I love you.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.578
(hangs up)

35:52.650 --> 35:54.651
How was that?

36:01.292 --> 36:02.626
No, we're going
right over here.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.527
Come on, this is my car.
(laughing)

36:03.529 --> 36:05.128
Just lean on my arm.
(alarm chirps)

36:05.130 --> 36:07.597
Come on. Get in.
Is this a camaro?

36:07.599 --> 36:09.332
No, it's a mustang.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.501
Damn, I haven't been in a camaro

36:11.503 --> 36:12.836
Since high school.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.540
Yeah, I know, all right?
Z/28 with the racing stripes.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.809
That thing was cherry.
Wow. You were rolling

36:19.811 --> 36:23.547
In a z/28, man.
You were the shizz, baby.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.615
Uh, hey, can we make

36:25.617 --> 36:27.684
These seats warm?
Because, you know,

36:27.686 --> 36:28.818
I get so hot
when I'm drunk,

36:28.820 --> 36:30.554
But right now my ass
is feelin' real cold.

36:30.556 --> 36:31.555
(chuckles)

36:31.557 --> 36:32.355
(quiet laugh)

36:32.357 --> 36:33.657
Hey.

36:33.659 --> 36:34.824
You ain't campbell.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.394
You ain't mad at that, are you?
(chuckles)

36:37.396 --> 36:38.995
I reckon not.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.565
Thought we'd go see
your boyfriend, dobson.

36:41.567 --> 36:42.866
What's the address?

36:42.868 --> 36:44.067
Kyle?

36:44.069 --> 36:46.203
I don't think
that's a good idea.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.506
Got a business
proposition for him.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.041
Come on, we'll get a
12-pack on the way.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.642
It'll be a laugh.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.010
Are you serious?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.712
You can't have too many friends.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.449
(engine starts)

37:00.551 --> 37:01.685
(tires screech)

37:01.687 --> 37:03.653
(engine revving)

37:03.655 --> 37:05.989
(tires screech)

37:17.235 --> 37:21.004
Kyle thinks I don't know
about this place, but I do.

37:23.174 --> 37:26.276
Let me help you there,
sweetheart.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.277
(tara chuckles)

37:27.279 --> 37:28.678
I got that.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.682
Who's in there?

37:32.684 --> 37:36.486
I don't know, probably just
kyle and one of his guys.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.090
Is there a back door?

37:40.092 --> 37:42.158
Why do you care?

37:46.897 --> 37:49.199
(knocking on door)

37:49.201 --> 37:50.267
Man:
Who is it?

37:50.269 --> 37:52.269
Tara:
It's me. Let me in.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.436
(lock buzzes)

37:54.438 --> 37:56.439
Well, this was your idea.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.308
Come on.

37:58.310 --> 38:01.778
(drill whirring,
indistinct chatter)

38:16.060 --> 38:17.093
You're not supposed
to be in here.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.828
Oh, shut up.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.830
It's Friday.

38:20.832 --> 38:24.000
We brought beer.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.002
Who's this?

38:26.004 --> 38:27.671
Name's barlow.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.139
Where's kyle, huh?

38:29.141 --> 38:31.241
He in the back?

38:36.514 --> 38:37.747
Oh. Come on.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.757
Kyle.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.760
Call you back.
Kyle.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.429
What the hell you doing here?

38:52.431 --> 38:55.699
Well, len here was nice enough
to give me a lift.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.767
Tara, I'm working.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.869
Tara: You work
too much, baby.

39:03.774 --> 39:04.908
Dobson:
Hey.

39:06.877 --> 39:07.944
Hey.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.145
What'd you say your name was?

39:09.147 --> 39:11.147
Len barlow.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.283
You look familiar.

39:13.285 --> 39:15.251
We met before?

39:17.855 --> 39:20.290
I don't think so.

39:20.292 --> 39:22.092
No?

39:24.228 --> 39:26.796
I got a memory for faces.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.432
Names... Not so much.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.302
Definitely

39:32.304 --> 39:34.537
Remember your mug.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.638
Tara: Why you
being so weird,

39:35.640 --> 39:37.073
Kyle?

39:37.075 --> 39:38.208
Hmm?

39:42.813 --> 39:44.748
You look like a guy I knew

39:44.750 --> 39:48.585
About ten years
ago, in iraq.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.388
Dead ringer.

39:53.657 --> 39:56.192
You could be his twin.

39:56.194 --> 39:58.395
Everybody's got one somewhere.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.397
Now tell me about
this friend of yours.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.532
What were you doing in iraq?

40:02.534 --> 40:04.501
I never said he was a friend.

40:08.339 --> 40:11.674
What I do know:
He's supposed to be dead.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.250
All right, you guys suck.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.119
This is no fun at all.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.687
Oh!

40:32.930 --> 40:33.730
Aah!

40:37.101 --> 40:39.569
(groaning in pain)

40:39.571 --> 40:40.904
What do you want?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.071
You want money?

40:42.073 --> 40:44.040
I want answers.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.775
(grunts)
get up.

40:46.410 --> 40:48.578
(panting)

40:48.580 --> 40:50.513
It's been a pleasure,
sweetheart.

40:55.486 --> 40:56.920
Move!

40:56.922 --> 40:59.055
Go on...

40:59.057 --> 41:00.557
Dobson: You're making
a big mistake, asshole.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.625
Get in the car!
Move!

41:02.627 --> 41:03.827
Get in! Get in there!

41:12.470 --> 41:14.370
(engine revving)

41:32.289 --> 41:35.425
(horn blaring)
