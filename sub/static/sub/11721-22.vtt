Oh, man.

01:17.515 --> 01:18.816
What happened to your face?

Dude, somebody barbecued

Oh, Mickey, that

Glad to see
you're finally

01:44.294 --> 01:46.132
reigning in
those man-boobs, bro.

01:46.134 --> 01:48.563
You know what this means,
though, right?

01:48.565 --> 01:49.930
I hooked up last night.

01:49.932 --> 01:51.265
So where's the lucky girl?

01:51.267 --> 01:52.832
Well, if she hooked up
with you

01:52.834 --> 01:54.703
looking like that,
she's probably in therapy.

01:54.705 --> 01:56.638
Oh, man.
No, no, no, no.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.669
Get away, get away.

01:57.671 --> 01:59.668
Last night must have been epic.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.670
I don't remember anything.

Hi. Yeah, room 1710.

Coffee, black.

02:09.221 --> 02:11.218

02:11.220 --> 02:12.721
Yeah.

02:12.723 --> 02:14.088
As fast as you can.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.288
Thanks.

02:15.290 --> 02:17.759
Man, I got first
dibs on the shower.

02:17.761 --> 02:19.055
(chuckles)

02:19.057 --> 02:20.728
You're finally gonna
take a shower?

02:20.730 --> 02:23.463
I think we've seen some serious
personal growth on this trip.

02:23.465 --> 02:25.430
Eat me.

02:25.432 --> 02:26.797
What are you doing?

02:26.799 --> 02:28.468
I'm seeing if we
took any cool pics.

02:28.470 --> 02:29.931
That's photographic
evidence, dude.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.602
You got to erase
that stuff right away.

04:59.805 --> 05:01.467
Oh, no, she knows,

05:01.469 --> 05:02.635
How does she know?

05:02.637 --> 05:03.866
Because she knows
everything, man.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.401
Send it to voice mail.
No, I can't do that.

05:06.403 --> 05:08.386
Then she's really gonna know
something's wrong.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.609
Something is wrong.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.891
There's a dead chick floating

all right, all right.

05:19.846 --> 05:21.613
What's the plan?

05:24.826 --> 05:26.361
Got the concept,
brutha?

05:26.363 --> 05:27.626
Yeah, I pitched you
the concept.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.994
I know, but I
refined it.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.633
"Kamekona's
personal guarantee.

05:30.635 --> 05:34.370
15-minute delivery, or
your grinds are free."

05:34.372 --> 05:36.433
I think 30 minutes
makes more sense.

05:36.435 --> 05:37.969
Plus, it's
the industry standard.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.641
Everybody does
30 minutes.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.737
But if we want to survive
in this competitive market,

05:41.739 --> 05:43.473
we got to make
a splash.

05:43.475 --> 05:44.672
So ride like the wind,

05:44.674 --> 05:45.912
'cause you've
got 14 minutes.

05:45.914 --> 05:47.376
You said 15.

05:47.378 --> 05:50.249
You wasted 60 seconds arguing
my business strategy.

05:50.251 --> 05:52.922
And remember the
company policy.

05:52.924 --> 05:54.891
If those grinds don't
get delivered on time,

05:54.893 --> 05:56.996
proceeds come straight
out of your pocket.

05:56.998 --> 05:58.860

08:21.104 --> 08:22.798
What are they saying?
Not much.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.333

could get them to talk.

08:26.704 --> 08:29.205
Yeah, be our pleasure.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.689
You okay, Jerry?

08:48.691 --> 08:50.689
No, I'm not okay. I'm pretty
freaked out right now.

08:50.691 --> 08:52.457
All right, just relax and
tell us what happened.

08:52.459 --> 08:55.192
So I'm at this light, and I see
this crazy guy pull up,

08:55.194 --> 08:57.559
grab a girl off the street,
shove her in his car.

08:57.561 --> 08:58.831
I had to do something,

08:58.833 --> 09:00.830
so I tail him
for a couple blocks,

09:00.832 --> 09:02.102
lose him for about a minute,

09:02.104 --> 09:04.901
then, boom, I round
the corner, and I find this.

09:11.038 --> 09:13.907
I thought you said
the guy abducted the girl.

09:14.740 --> 09:16.546
Yeah, that's right.

09:17.412 --> 09:19.283
So where is she?

09:34.177 --> 09:35.847
You know how many
dead bodies I saw

09:35.849 --> 09:37.711
before I started
hanging out with Five-O?

09:38.881 --> 09:40.183
That would be none.

09:40.185 --> 09:41.350
Nada.

09:41.352 --> 09:42.581
Zero.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.588
And the fun doesn't stop there.

09:44.590 --> 09:45.852
I mean, let's not forget

09:45.854 --> 09:48.091
being accused of robbery,
being abducted,

09:48.093 --> 09:50.188
having my life's
work stolen,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.492
and, oh, yeah,
then there's that Chinese spy

09:52.494 --> 09:54.195
who broke into my house
and tried to off me.

09:54.197 --> 09:56.826
Yeah, we appreciate everything
you've done for us, Jer.

09:56.828 --> 09:58.762
So where's the love?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.098
The aloha?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.634
A badge would be nice.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.738
All right, so, uh,
HPD canvassed the area.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.202
No sign of the girl.

10:06.204 --> 10:08.738
I don't get it. If it was
self-defense, why would she run?

10:08.740 --> 10:11.075
Well, this might be why.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.086
Here's our Vic,
William Malo, 30.

10:13.088 --> 10:14.519
He's local.

10:14.521 --> 10:16.751
HPD responded to multiple
domestic disputes at his house

10:16.753 --> 10:18.622
in the last year,
but no charges were filed.

10:18.624 --> 10:21.127
Okay, so maybe it's a
husband-and-wife thing

10:21.129 --> 10:22.991
that went to the next level.
That's what I'm thinking.

10:22.993 --> 10:25.159
So this is his wife.

10:25.161 --> 10:27.166
Is that the woman
you saw, Jerry?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.428
No, that's not her.

10:30.932 --> 10:33.499
Well, if she's not the
wife, then who is she?

10:33.501 --> 10:34.633
I don't know who she is,

10:34.635 --> 10:36.503
and I don't know
how she got in that tub.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.229
But I do know
we didn't kill her.

10:38.231 --> 10:39.668
Oh, you do know that, do you?

10:39.670 --> 10:41.529
'Cause you just told me
you don't remember anything

10:41.531 --> 10:42.833
from last night.

10:42.835 --> 10:44.538
Well, yeah, Th-that's
true, but...

10:44.540 --> 10:45.634
But-but-but what?

10:45.636 --> 10:48.706
All right, well,
maybe I did say that.

10:48.708 --> 10:51.947
So you're saying it's possible
you did kill that girl.

10:51.949 --> 10:53.812
No, look...

10:53.814 --> 10:55.348
I don't know, okay?

10:55.350 --> 10:57.918
I just don't know.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.928
We came over here for a
boys' weekend, all right?

11:01.930 --> 11:04.192
You got to believe me,
man, we're good guys.

11:04.194 --> 11:05.759
(laughs)
"Good guys"?

11:05.761 --> 11:07.095
Good guys? You're a bunch

11:07.097 --> 11:08.895
of married, 40-year-old guys
come all the way

11:08.897 --> 11:10.967
to Hawaii for spring break
to hit on college girls.

11:10.969 --> 11:13.568
I mean, you must have
very understanding wives.

11:14.906 --> 11:16.744
Babe, I miss you, too.

11:16.746 --> 11:18.375
Relax, all right?

11:18.377 --> 11:19.878
We'll be careful.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.614
It's not our first time
hunting together.

11:27.245 --> 11:29.448
Uh, I already told you--
wild boar.

11:29.450 --> 11:32.280
Yeah, that's what they hunt
here in Hawaii.

11:32.282 --> 11:34.321
They're all over the place.

11:36.421 --> 11:38.187
Yeah, the, uh...
the-the little...

11:38.189 --> 11:39.627
the little piggies
with the tusks.

11:39.629 --> 11:40.795
(laughter)

11:40.797 --> 11:43.227
Look, you're
probably married, right?

11:43.229 --> 11:44.899
So, you know how it is.

11:44.901 --> 11:46.131
GROVER:
No!

11:46.133 --> 11:47.635
I don't.

11:47.637 --> 11:49.171
MICKEY:
<i>We were getting stale.</i>

11:49.173 --> 11:51.339
Just crunching numbers.

11:51.341 --> 11:55.304
And-and sitting in a cubicle
watching our lives pass us by.

11:55.306 --> 11:56.671
In Cleveland!

11:56.673 --> 11:59.349
And-and-and Jake said that
we needed to do something.

11:59.350 --> 12:02.345
You know, something crazy
to get our mojo back.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.745
(humming a tune)
Oh!

12:05.747 --> 12:07.551
Boom!

12:07.553 --> 12:09.246
Oh, oh!
(yells)

12:09.248 --> 12:11.014
Ah!
Ooh!

12:11.016 --> 12:13.222
Ooh!

12:13.224 --> 12:16.055
(laughing)
Mm, all right.

12:16.057 --> 12:18.960
Say good-bye! Good-bye!

12:18.962 --> 12:20.531
All right, guys, come on, huh?

12:20.533 --> 12:22.133
Huh? To good times!

12:22.135 --> 12:24.037
All right.
Oh, and to lots of sex

12:24.039 --> 12:25.973
with women who are
not our wives.

12:25.975 --> 12:27.078
(laughing)

12:27.080 --> 12:29.278
Jake said if we
flashed a little cash,

12:29.280 --> 12:30.878
you know, scoring with
these college chicks

12:30.880 --> 12:32.647
would be like shooting
fish in a barrel.

12:32.649 --> 12:34.385
Shoot...? Or-or it ended up
being shooting

12:34.387 --> 12:36.217
a girl in the head
in the bathtub.

12:36.219 --> 12:37.625
Okay, I get it.

12:37.627 --> 12:38.993
Bad choice of words.

12:38.995 --> 12:40.623
Okay. Listen, Dopey.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.559
Uh, we found guns in your room.

12:44.793 --> 12:47.526
It was part of the ruse
for the wives, okay?

12:47.528 --> 12:49.430
They never came out of the case.

12:49.432 --> 12:52.099
Well, somebody in that room
fired that shot!

12:52.101 --> 12:54.667
Why would we kill a girl
that we don't even know?!

12:54.669 --> 12:56.066
Why would a girl
you don't even know

12:56.068 --> 12:57.634
have your hotel key
in her pocket?

12:59.637 --> 13:03.075
And how many room keys
will you be needing?

13:03.077 --> 13:06.443
18.

13:07.285 --> 13:08.483
18?

13:08.485 --> 13:10.714
Mm-hmm.
(laughing)

13:12.156 --> 13:13.482
It's a numbers game.

13:13.484 --> 13:15.185
The more lines
you throw out in the water,

13:15.187 --> 13:17.018
the better chance you have
of catching a fish.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.626
Everyone knows that.

13:18.628 --> 13:20.595
Okay, here's what I think.

13:20.597 --> 13:22.859
Um, I think that one
of you guys

13:22.861 --> 13:25.028
brought the girl
to your room and, uh,

13:25.030 --> 13:27.005
it didn't go the way you wanted
it go, feelings got hurt,

13:27.007 --> 13:28.535
and she ended up shot.
That's-that's what I think.

13:28.537 --> 13:31.074
No way! That's not
what happened! No!

13:31.076 --> 13:33.517
STEVE: You guys need to work
on your alibi.

13:33.519 --> 13:35.854
All right? You're gonna kill
somebody, you need an alibi.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.720
You literally just

13:37.722 --> 13:39.563
told me you were too drunk

13:39.565 --> 13:41.564
to remember anything
from last night.

13:41.566 --> 13:43.637
Yeah.
What if you don't remember

13:43.639 --> 13:44.974
killing that girl?

13:44.976 --> 13:46.775
No.

13:46.777 --> 13:49.112
I... I would remember that!

13:49.114 --> 13:50.607
All right, explain something
to me-- if you are innocent,

13:50.609 --> 13:52.312
then why is it
that you went all the way up

13:52.314 --> 13:54.713
to the crater to try
to dispose of this body?

13:54.715 --> 13:56.017
Why didn't you
just call the police?

13:56.019 --> 13:57.849
We were scared!

13:57.851 --> 13:59.553
Of losing our jobs.

13:59.555 --> 14:01.057
Getting caught by our wives!

14:02.595 --> 14:04.130
Look, man...

14:04.132 --> 14:06.395
you got to believe me,
all right?

14:06.397 --> 14:10.036
I'd give anything to remember
what happened last night.

14:10.038 --> 14:12.401
Anything.

14:15.572 --> 14:18.507
Clearly, the broken nails
indicate

14:18.509 --> 14:20.978
your victim struggled
with her attacker

14:20.980 --> 14:23.579
before she died.

14:23.581 --> 14:25.147
She also has

14:25.149 --> 14:26.947
defensive bruising
along the forearms.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.524
Hmm. I tell you, Doc,
I don't get it.

14:30.526 --> 14:32.219
I never could understand
this spring break thing.

14:32.221 --> 14:34.595
These parents send their
kids off on their own dime

14:34.597 --> 14:36.492
to drink and use
drugs and possibly

14:36.494 --> 14:38.060
end up like this young lady.

14:38.062 --> 14:40.364
Well, you do understand it is
a time-honored tradition

14:40.366 --> 14:43.003
among most American
college students.

14:43.005 --> 14:44.370
Including myself.

14:44.372 --> 14:46.835
Well... all due respect, Doc,

14:46.837 --> 14:49.568
you don't seem like the kind
of guy that's gonna end up

14:49.570 --> 14:51.933
sucking Jell-O shots
off some girl's belly.

14:51.935 --> 14:53.036
That is correct.

14:53.038 --> 14:55.170
However, there was
an incident in Cancún,

14:55.172 --> 14:57.936
spring of '94, that involved
a bottle of absinthe,

14:57.938 --> 15:01.543
a regrettable tattoo and
48 hours in a Mexican prison.

15:01.545 --> 15:03.375
Yeah.

15:03.377 --> 15:06.544
I don't think I want
to know any details.

15:06.546 --> 15:08.480
Nor would I care to elaborate.

15:08.482 --> 15:11.693
Yeah, let's just, uh, move on.

15:11.695 --> 15:14.328
So, can you tell me anything
else about this young lady?

15:14.330 --> 15:16.465
T.O.D. was between midnight

15:16.467 --> 15:17.801
and 2:00 a.m.

15:17.803 --> 15:18.938
Ballistic evidence

15:18.940 --> 15:20.538
recovered from her body

15:20.540 --> 15:22.138
had no matches in IBIS.

15:22.140 --> 15:24.737
However, I did discover traces
of glitter in her hair

15:24.739 --> 15:26.713
and on both of her shoes.

15:26.715 --> 15:28.313
Well, she could've
picked that up anywhere.

15:28.315 --> 15:30.481
A bar or a party or something?

15:30.483 --> 15:31.785
Or perhaps neither.

15:31.787 --> 15:34.784
Tox screen suggested
there was no signs

15:34.786 --> 15:36.784
of alcohol or drugs
in her system.

15:36.786 --> 15:39.258
However, the same test
on our three suspects

15:39.260 --> 15:41.291
told a very different story.

15:41.293 --> 15:44.164
In addition to the copious
amounts of alcohol,

15:44.166 --> 15:47.134
our three gentlemen showed
high dosages of ketamine--

15:47.136 --> 15:49.842
more commonly known
as Special K-- in their system.

15:49.844 --> 15:52.278
With that high of a dosage,
it is quite plausible

15:52.280 --> 15:54.687
that they had no recollection
of the entire night

15:54.689 --> 15:57.488
as well as the moments prior
to taking those drugs.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.654
Hmm. Well, then I guess maybe

15:59.656 --> 16:01.925
Curly, Larry and Moe
are telling the truth.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.525
The nose is a little
flatter and wider.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.303
Okay, yeah.

16:09.305 --> 16:11.470
And, uh, the cheekbones
are more pronounced.

16:13.977 --> 16:15.943
You did it. That's her.
All right, thanks, Chen.

16:15.945 --> 16:17.375
We'll take it from here.

16:18.776 --> 16:20.509
Okay. (sighs)

16:20.511 --> 16:22.982
Let's run it through facial rec.

16:31.022 --> 16:31.916
Right there!

16:31.918 --> 16:33.156
That's her!

16:36.127 --> 16:37.831
KONO:
Natalie Morris--

16:37.833 --> 16:40.631
wanted by the FBI for kidnapping
and sex trafficking charges.

16:41.337 --> 16:42.902
CHIN:
Yeah, it looks like

16:42.904 --> 16:46.069
her thing is luring young girls
over from Latin America

16:46.071 --> 16:48.501
with the promise
of lucrative modeling contracts.

16:48.503 --> 16:52.007
Once they enter the country
using temporary work visas,

16:52.009 --> 16:54.848
they disappear.

16:54.850 --> 16:56.648
JERRY: Okay, now I get
why she'd run.

16:56.650 --> 16:59.150
But why would William Malo--
a guy with no criminal record--

16:59.152 --> 17:01.852
just try to grab her off the
street in broad daylight?

17:05.556 --> 17:08.218
WOMAN: <i> Where the hell are you?</i>
(baby crying)

17:08.220 --> 17:10.089
I called your room ten times!

17:10.092 --> 17:11.922
Pick up the damn phone,

17:11.924 --> 17:14.424
you selfish son of a bitch!

17:14.425 --> 17:16.326
I knew I shouldn't
have let you go.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.996
Wild boar, my ass!

17:18.998 --> 17:20.490
Enjoy yourself, jackass.

17:20.492 --> 17:24.590
Because this will be
the last trip you ever take!

17:24.593 --> 17:25.991
You hear me?!

17:25.992 --> 17:28.932
I swear to God you are so
on the couch when you get home!

17:28.934 --> 17:30.163
(line clicks)

17:30.165 --> 17:32.761
Really seems, uh,
like a catch, this lady.

17:32.763 --> 17:35.431
Uh, six messages just like that
all from this morning.

17:35.433 --> 17:36.598
Hmm.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.964
Is that normal?

17:38.966 --> 17:40.163
What do you mean?

17:40.165 --> 17:41.731
Why you asking me?

17:41.733 --> 17:43.834
Well, you're... divorced.

17:43.836 --> 17:45.265
Oh, I see.

17:45.267 --> 17:48.400
You're comparing this to, uh...
me and Rachel.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.400
Listen.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.968
WOMAN:
I hope your plane crashes

17:50.970 --> 17:54.607
on the way back,
you hairless, ball-less loser!

17:54.609 --> 17:56.846
Never mind. Nah.
It's good.

17:56.848 --> 17:59.781
So, I just hung up
with ballistics.

17:59.783 --> 18:01.444
Our suspects' rifles
were no match

18:01.446 --> 18:03.379
for the slug pulled
out of the Vic.

18:03.381 --> 18:05.212
DANNY: Okay, uh, they
still could've dumped

18:05.214 --> 18:07.883
the murder weapon
before they dumped the body.

18:07.885 --> 18:09.283
Yeah, but this girl
was executed.

18:09.285 --> 18:10.650
One shot to the head.

18:10.652 --> 18:12.258
According
to Max's tox screen,

18:12.260 --> 18:14.259
these boys were so polluted

18:14.261 --> 18:17.058
they'd have to empty
a whole clip just to hit

18:17.060 --> 18:19.729
the side of a barn.
All right, let's just say for a minute

18:19.731 --> 18:21.392
they didn't do
it, all right?

18:21.394 --> 18:24.033
The Vic still had their room
key in her pocket, which means

18:24.035 --> 18:25.936
at some point
during the night

18:25.938 --> 18:28.231
their paths had
to have crossed, right?

18:28.233 --> 18:30.597
Well, the last thing they
remember is going to some club

18:30.599 --> 18:32.573
called the Sand Fiddler
at 9:00 p.m.

18:32.575 --> 18:35.270
Max puts the time of death
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.

18:35.272 --> 18:37.174
All right. Well, we need
to retrace their steps,

18:37.176 --> 18:39.647
try to figure out
what happened in between.

18:48.111 --> 18:51.649
♪ ♪

18:55.822 --> 18:57.959
(indistinct chatter, shouting)

19:13.618 --> 19:14.687
We've been here
for three minutes--

19:14.689 --> 19:16.483
I've already seen
six felonies.

19:16.485 --> 19:17.786
Seven.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.289
Promise me
one thing, buddy.

19:21.291 --> 19:24.654
Just promise me Gracie will get
her college degree online.

19:24.656 --> 19:27.054
Done. Why would you even

19:27.056 --> 19:29.220
bring up her name here?

19:30.924 --> 19:32.992
Hello.
Hi.

19:32.994 --> 19:34.382
How's it going?

19:34.406 --> 19:35.895
Hi. I'm guessing you guys
aren't here for the Beer Pong,

19:35.896 --> 19:38.585
Panty Jam this afternoon.
The Beer... No, no.

19:38.587 --> 19:40.255
I don't know if I want
to know what that is.

19:40.257 --> 19:41.654
No, you
probably don't.

19:41.656 --> 19:43.493
Were you, uh... were you
working here last night?

19:43.495 --> 19:44.789
I haven't left
since Tuesday.

19:44.791 --> 19:46.189
What can I
do for you?

19:46.191 --> 19:50.564
I was wondering if you could,
uh, tell us, please...

19:50.566 --> 19:52.100
you see these guys
hanging around at all?

19:52.102 --> 19:55.035
No. I don't remember seeing
any parents here last night.

19:55.037 --> 19:58.232
That's...
(chuckles) Okay.

19:58.234 --> 19:59.968
What about her?

20:01.705 --> 20:04.704
She's dead.
Yeah, she is. I'm sorry to have

20:04.706 --> 20:06.041
to show you this,
but do you remember

20:06.043 --> 20:07.547
seeing her here
last night?

20:08.783 --> 20:10.182
I'm sorry.

20:10.184 --> 20:12.824
You sure you didn't see her?

20:12.826 --> 20:15.222
Take a look around.

20:15.224 --> 20:17.820
After a while, they all start
to look the same.

20:18.830 --> 20:21.194
Yeah. Okay.
Sorry I couldn't help you.

20:21.196 --> 20:23.162
Tonight on <i> Fugitive Profiles,</i>

20:23.164 --> 20:25.960
the FBI is asking
for your help in capturing

20:25.962 --> 20:28.693
a dangerous fugitive
from justice.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.492
Her name, Natalie Morris.

20:30.494 --> 20:33.100
This episode
aired last night.

20:33.102 --> 20:36.129
Okay. So it looks
like our victim William Malo

20:36.131 --> 20:38.063
saw Natalie on TV,
tried to be a hero,

20:38.065 --> 20:40.799
but she turned the tables
and took him out. Hmm.

20:40.801 --> 20:43.638
I always thought these shows
were scripted propaganda created

20:43.640 --> 20:47.543
by huge media conglomerates
to brainwash the L.I.V.'s.

20:48.913 --> 20:51.375
Low-information viewers.

20:51.377 --> 20:53.680
They scare the unwitting public
into demanding more police

20:53.682 --> 20:55.847
on the street
and then use it as an excuse

20:55.849 --> 20:57.447
to raise taxes to feed the beast

20:57.449 --> 20:58.886
that is
Uncle Sam.

20:58.888 --> 21:00.454
Got it.

21:00.456 --> 21:01.991
Apparently,
that is not the case.

21:01.993 --> 21:03.488
But Natalie can't be too happy

21:03.490 --> 21:06.063
about her 15 minutes of fame.
Yeah.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.159
I'll reach out to the FBI,

21:07.161 --> 21:08.759
see if she had any known
associates on the island,

21:08.761 --> 21:10.096
someone she might have
reached out to for help.

21:10.098 --> 21:12.232
Okay.

21:12.234 --> 21:14.232
L.I.V.'s.

21:16.170 --> 21:18.136
WOMAN:
Oh. Yeah.

21:18.138 --> 21:20.776
I remember those guys.
They tipped.

21:20.778 --> 21:22.511
And that's-that's
memorable?

21:22.513 --> 21:24.479
During spring
break, it is.

21:24.481 --> 21:27.781
And they were old.
Like, at least 40.

21:27.783 --> 21:30.214
Sorry.
(chuckles)

21:30.216 --> 21:32.517
Okay, do you remember
anything else about these guys?

21:32.519 --> 21:37.087
Just that they hit on every girl
at the bar at least once.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.792
Hey. I love your bikini.

21:39.794 --> 21:41.529
Thanks.

21:41.531 --> 21:44.002
It would look great
on the floor of my

21:44.004 --> 21:46.568
crazy-expensive hotel suite.

21:46.570 --> 21:47.936
I'm sure.

21:47.938 --> 21:48.969
Right next to your adult diaper.

21:48.971 --> 21:50.040
(scoffs)

21:50.042 --> 21:51.704
(laughing)

21:53.178 --> 21:54.408
It's a numbers game!

21:55.313 --> 21:56.708
Ladies, ladies.

21:56.710 --> 21:59.810
So, uh, which one of you
has the lowest standards?

21:59.812 --> 22:02.144
(chuckles) 'Cause I'm here.
You know what I'm saying?

22:02.146 --> 22:04.080
I'm here. What's going on?
Wait, wait.

22:04.082 --> 22:05.376
I can turn it up, though.

22:05.378 --> 22:06.816
All right.
All right, we're cool.

22:06.818 --> 22:09.615
Hey, there's a big sale
back at my room.

22:09.617 --> 22:11.247
Clothes are 100% off.

22:11.249 --> 22:13.981
(both laughing)

22:13.983 --> 22:15.020
(laughing)

22:15.022 --> 22:16.020
I'm serious.

22:16.022 --> 22:17.884
I know.

22:17.886 --> 22:18.923
(laughing)

22:18.925 --> 22:20.986
(laughs)

22:25.162 --> 22:27.893
Was she was one of the ladies
they hit on?

22:29.430 --> 22:31.890
I don't remember
seeing her here last night.

22:31.892 --> 22:36.094
Okay, how long
did these guys stick around?

22:36.096 --> 22:37.997
I closed their tab around 11:00.

22:37.999 --> 22:41.131
They were pretty wasted,
so I called them a cab.

22:42.597 --> 22:44.299
MAN:
Do you know how hard it is

22:44.301 --> 22:46.330
to get the smell of vomit
out of pleather?

22:46.332 --> 22:49.167
GROVER:
Thankfully, I do not.

22:49.169 --> 22:50.699
Those clowns were
out of control.

22:50.701 --> 22:52.695
Grown men acting like
a bunch of drunk college kids.

22:52.697 --> 22:53.758
All right, sir.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.259
Where did you drop them off?

22:56.261 --> 22:58.694
A place called The FIX.

23:03.197 --> 23:05.561
What, uh... what happened
after that?

23:05.563 --> 23:07.025
They ordered
another round

23:07.027 --> 23:08.064
and struck out again.

23:08.066 --> 23:10.325
(loud music plays,
man howls gleefully)

23:11.166 --> 23:14.027
Ah... come on,
I wanna lay ya!

23:14.029 --> 23:15.363
(laughter, howling)

23:15.365 --> 23:16.900
Free shots for
the lovely ladies!

23:16.902 --> 23:19.532
Get 'em!
(girls cheering)

23:19.534 --> 23:20.869
Here we go!

23:21.712 --> 23:24.512
(shouting)

23:27.587 --> 23:29.785
Ladies...
Come on.

23:29.787 --> 23:30.784
Oh...

23:30.786 --> 23:31.952
Hey.

23:31.954 --> 23:33.456
They'll be back.
They'll be back.

23:33.458 --> 23:34.591
They're just doing
a boomerang.

23:34.593 --> 23:35.855
They'll come
right back.

23:35.857 --> 23:37.223
I give them "E" for effort,

23:37.225 --> 23:39.022
but after a while,

23:39.024 --> 23:40.462
it started to get
sloppy, brah.

23:40.464 --> 23:42.360
Customers started to complain.

23:42.362 --> 23:44.065
So I politely
asked them to leave.

23:48.169 --> 23:49.399
You guys refusing to leave, too?

23:49.401 --> 23:50.839
No. No. No.

23:54.441 --> 23:55.974
Come on, get him
out of here.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.244
All right, we got you,
we got you.

23:58.246 --> 24:00.811
We got to call the people.
We got to call the people.

24:00.813 --> 24:02.443
You know what?
I'm not leaving.

24:02.445 --> 24:04.241
What?
No, no.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.174
You want to get
your ass kicked?

24:06.176 --> 24:07.779
We drive BMWs, right?

24:07.781 --> 24:08.905
That punk couldn't even

24:08.907 --> 24:10.240
get us coffee back at home!

24:10.242 --> 24:11.271
No, no, no,
let it go.

24:11.273 --> 24:13.407
Just let it...
let it go.

24:15.575 --> 24:16.909
Come on.

24:20.814 --> 24:22.052
Come on, let's go.

24:22.054 --> 24:24.051
Everybody just calm down.

24:24.053 --> 24:25.018
Jake,

24:25.020 --> 24:25.954
what are you doing?

24:25.956 --> 24:27.082
Hey, buddy,
can I borrow that?

24:27.084 --> 24:28.386
Jake!
Yah!

24:28.388 --> 24:30.859
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

24:30.861 --> 24:32.091
Oh! Oh!

24:32.093 --> 24:33.292
Look out!

24:33.294 --> 24:35.062
Look out!
(laughing)

24:35.064 --> 24:36.302
Jake, take it easy!

24:36.304 --> 24:37.768
Ah! Come on, you big ape!

24:37.770 --> 24:39.272
Huh?

24:39.274 --> 24:40.336
You want some of me?

24:40.338 --> 24:41.943
(screeches like an ape)
Huh?

24:41.945 --> 24:42.974
Anybody hungry? Huh?

24:42.976 --> 24:45.078
No!
Anybody hungry? Huh?

24:45.080 --> 24:46.046
Jake!
'Cause I'm gonna

24:46.048 --> 24:48.413
shish kabob open.

24:48.415 --> 24:50.708
Hey...

24:56.189 --> 24:57.915
Ow!
(yelling)

24:57.917 --> 24:59.523
Oh!
Oh!

25:02.155 --> 25:03.992
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, hold on...

25:03.994 --> 25:05.488
Hey.
Cops, cops!

25:05.490 --> 25:06.792
Cops!
Let's go, let's go,

25:06.794 --> 25:08.696
let's go!

25:08.698 --> 25:10.464
Oh, damn...

25:10.466 --> 25:11.928
I chased them a few blocks,

25:11.930 --> 25:13.568
but I lost them
around this corner.

25:13.570 --> 25:16.504
They either ran down
one of these alleys

25:16.506 --> 25:19.072
or ducked
into a club.

25:19.074 --> 25:21.136
Hang on a second.

25:23.809 --> 25:25.175
Yeah, Steve.

25:25.177 --> 25:26.605
Listen, you remember that trace

25:26.607 --> 25:28.571
that Max found on our Vic?

25:28.573 --> 25:29.578
Well, I think

25:29.580 --> 25:31.546
I got an idea
where it came from.

25:31.548 --> 25:32.881
CHIN:
Okay, thanks.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.743
Whoa. Slow down.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.079
Where are we going?

25:39.081 --> 25:40.350
Who was that on the phone?

25:40.352 --> 25:41.582
FBI.

25:41.584 --> 25:42.885
Multiple grand
jury witnesses

25:42.887 --> 25:44.717
testified that Natalie
Morris was actually working

25:44.719 --> 25:46.588
with an unidentified
coconspirator:

25:46.590 --> 25:50.556
male, six-foot-two,
dark hair, athletic build,

25:50.558 --> 25:52.595
with a scar under
his left eye.

25:52.597 --> 25:55.229
Sound familiar?

26:01.070 --> 26:02.068
Same scar.

26:02.070 --> 26:03.605
They were partners.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.311
And with all
the recent publicity,

26:06.313 --> 26:08.278
Natalie became a liability.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.741
So he wasn't just
some Good Samaritan

26:09.743 --> 26:11.045
trying to make
a citizen's arrest.

26:11.047 --> 26:12.516
He was trying
to kill his partner

26:12.518 --> 26:14.348
before she brought him
down with her.

26:25.632 --> 26:28.230
♪ ♪

26:33.306 --> 26:35.505
(whooping, laughing)

26:46.559 --> 26:48.757

CROWD:

27:11.929 --> 27:15.591
Whoever lost this,
come and get some!

27:27.671 --> 27:29.373
Well, imagine your drunk dad

27:29.375 --> 27:31.205
hitting on college girls
with some friends.

27:31.207 --> 27:33.380
It was pretty hard to miss them.
Hmm.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.846
Were the guys hitting on
this girl here?

27:35.848 --> 27:39.154
(gasps) Oh, my gosh.
Wait a minute,

27:39.156 --> 27:41.427
you know her?
That's Rebecca.

27:41.429 --> 27:43.124
Rebecca.

27:43.126 --> 27:44.492
What's Rebecca's last name?

27:44.494 --> 27:46.501
Um... Oleana.

27:46.503 --> 27:48.368
She's-She's a
waitress here.

27:48.370 --> 27:50.009
You think those guys
did that to her?

27:50.011 --> 27:51.241
No, uh, we don't think so.

27:51.243 --> 27:53.011
But we're trying
to figure out who did.

27:54.719 --> 27:57.686
Tori, do you know if Rebecca
has any family here?

27:58.888 --> 28:01.189
Her mom, but she moved
to the mainland last year

28:01.191 --> 28:03.557
and Rebecca stayed behind
to finish up at U of H.

28:03.559 --> 28:06.427
Oh. What time'd
she leave last night?

28:06.429 --> 28:08.827
Well, she was done
early and she...

28:08.829 --> 28:10.929
she was out before
last call at 2:00.

28:10.931 --> 28:13.863
Did she leave with any
of the guys that we showed you?

28:15.097 --> 28:17.830
No. No, they-they definitely
tried hitting on her.

28:17.832 --> 28:19.900
And one of them even
gave her his room key,

28:19.902 --> 28:21.467
but... but they
were here a while

28:21.469 --> 28:22.341
after she left.

28:22.365 --> 28:23.835
Okay, wait a minute,
is there any chance

28:23.836 --> 28:25.097
that Rebecca left early because

28:25.099 --> 28:26.535
she intended on using
that room key?

28:26.537 --> 28:29.000
No. No, never.

28:29.002 --> 28:31.503
Though Rebecca said she had
to get up early for something.

28:31.505 --> 28:32.943
Early for what?

28:32.945 --> 28:36.342
I don't know,
but whatever it was,

28:36.344 --> 28:39.047
she seemed excited, so it must
have been important.

29:07.673 --> 29:09.175
Hey, Lou.

29:09.177 --> 29:10.814
Yeah?

29:12.081 --> 29:15.380
Got a letter here
for Rebecca from a lawyer.

29:16.285 --> 29:17.947
"Dear Rebecca Oleana:

29:17.949 --> 29:20.515
"After an exhaustive
investigation, Mr. Garvey

29:20.517 --> 29:22.415
"has good reason
to believe that he

29:22.417 --> 29:25.778
"is your biological father.

29:25.780 --> 29:29.150
"Unfortunately, his health
is deteriorating rapidly.

29:29.152 --> 29:32.443
"It is his sincerest
hope that you would be

29:32.445 --> 29:35.912
"open to meeting with him
in the very near future.

29:35.914 --> 29:39.318
"Please contact this office
at your earliest convenience

29:39.320 --> 29:41.349
"so the proper arrangements
can be made to finally

29:41.351 --> 29:43.316
bring the two of
you together."

29:47.652 --> 29:50.184
It's postmarked
three days ago.

29:50.186 --> 29:51.551
Well, no wonder
she was so excited.

29:51.553 --> 29:53.821
She was about to meet
her father for the first time.

30:02.930 --> 30:05.360
MAN:
Three months ago...

30:05.362 --> 30:09.064
my father was diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

30:09.066 --> 30:11.232
The last few days have
been really rough.

30:11.234 --> 30:14.802
Doctors say he can
pass at any time.

30:14.804 --> 30:17.612
I think the only thing
that's kept him hanging on

30:17.614 --> 30:20.444
was his hope of
meeting Rebecca.

30:20.446 --> 30:23.316
(clears throat)

30:23.318 --> 30:25.052
Look, if you don't
mind my asking,

30:25.054 --> 30:27.557
why were they estranged
to begin with?

30:29.792 --> 30:32.398
Look, I just
found this out myself.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.659
He had an affair 20 years ago.

30:34.661 --> 30:36.960
He didn't
want it

30:36.962 --> 30:39.460
to destroy the family,
so financial arrangements

30:39.462 --> 30:41.124
were made
with the mother.

30:42.326 --> 30:44.561
He said...

30:44.563 --> 30:46.495
it was his
biggest regret.

30:46.497 --> 30:48.662
That he was ashamed

30:48.664 --> 30:50.262
of turning his back
on his daughter.

30:50.264 --> 30:54.027
He wanted to make it
right, so...

30:54.029 --> 30:58.005
I promised that I would
find her before he passed.

30:59.438 --> 31:01.801
And you did?

31:02.971 --> 31:05.873
I spoke to her on the phone.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.775
I thought she'd be
so angry, but she wasn't.

31:07.777 --> 31:10.374
She just, you know,
wanted to meet us,

31:10.376 --> 31:11.845
make up for lost time.

31:11.847 --> 31:14.644
What about the lawyers?

31:14.646 --> 31:17.380
Did they find anything
that you think might help us

31:17.382 --> 31:19.149
figure out why
she was murdered?

31:19.151 --> 31:21.350
No.

31:21.352 --> 31:23.325
By all accounts,
she was a great kid.

31:23.327 --> 31:25.525
I'm happy to put you in touch
with the private investigator

31:25.527 --> 31:29.124
who found her.
Yeah, thank you.

31:31.566 --> 31:33.930
I don't know
what to tell him.

31:33.932 --> 31:37.125
Maybe it's just...
better to let him hope

31:37.127 --> 31:39.395
she might still
be coming.

31:45.661 --> 31:48.622
HPD searched Malo's place.
Looks like Natalie

31:48.624 --> 31:50.221
stopped by to change,
load up and

31:50.223 --> 31:52.194
grab some cash.
Means she's on the move.

31:52.196 --> 31:53.560
Everywhere's locked down.
Big Brother's watching.

31:53.562 --> 31:56.897
There aren't a lot of places
for a fugitive to hide out.

31:56.899 --> 31:58.393
Actually, there might be.

31:58.395 --> 32:00.162
Malo had several legitimate
business holdings,

32:00.164 --> 32:02.702
including a small company
called Island Spirit Coffee.

32:02.704 --> 32:05.881
The coffee is farmed on
the island of Hawai'i.
