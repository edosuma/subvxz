00:33.721 --> 00:35.931
<i>In the movies, Dracula wears a cape,</i>

00:35.973 --> 00:38.350
<i>and some old English guy
always manages to save the day</i>

00:38.434 --> 00:41.020
<i>at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.</i>

00:41.771 --> 00:44.690
<i>But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.</i>

00:45.733 --> 00:50.571
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.</i>

00:50.654 --> 00:53.115
<i>The rest of us
were just along for the ride.</i>

03:02.202 --> 03:03.870
What's this chicken scratch?

03:04.162 --> 03:06.331
It's cuneiform.

03:06.414 --> 03:08.792
It's about 4,000 years old.

03:09.459 --> 03:10.585
So why here?

03:10.669 --> 03:13.588
Because this is the cradle of civilization.

03:15.131 --> 03:17.634
He would've been comfortable here.

03:17.717 --> 03:20.178
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

03:20.262 --> 03:21.513
There's something beneath us.

03:21.596 --> 03:23.515
You find a watch?

03:26.601 --> 03:27.936
Is it a body?

03:32.232 --> 03:33.400
Guys?

03:36.945 --> 03:38.905
Aah!

03:40.657 --> 03:43.368
Go! Aah!

03:43.451 --> 03:45.287
What the fuck?!

03:55.046 --> 03:57.507
Aah!

06:15.687 --> 06:17.272
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

06:17.355 --> 06:18.732
Got it. Heading westbound.

06:18.767 --> 06:19.691
I'm just beneath ya.

06:19.774 --> 06:21.192
Go!

08:37.578 --> 08:39.414
I got him. Pull!

08:40.707 --> 08:41.707
You all right, man?

08:59.643 --> 09:00.852
He's got a gun!

09:15.408 --> 09:17.327
Oh, my God!

09:28.713 --> 09:29.881
Ouch.

09:32.676 --> 09:34.636
Staked you with silver.

09:35.512 --> 09:37.555
Why aren't you ash?

09:37.639 --> 09:39.808
Why aren't you smarter?

09:40.850 --> 09:43.395
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

09:48.900 --> 09:50.944
Set your sorry ass up.

10:09.254 --> 10:11.047
Damn.

10:38.325 --> 10:40.493
Oh, Blade.

11:17.864 --> 11:19.616
What the fuck happen tonight?

11:22.202 --> 11:23.870
How should I know?

11:24.955 --> 11:26.373
He was human.

11:27.207 --> 11:28.500
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.377
Killing vampires is clean.

11:30.460 --> 11:34.214
They ash- don't leave
any evidence behind.

11:34.256 --> 11:35.840
Killing humans is messy.

11:35.924 --> 11:37.842
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

11:38.802 --> 11:40.845
This worked really good.

11:44.975 --> 11:46.184
What's this?

11:46.268 --> 11:48.603
A new delivery system for your serum.

11:48.645 --> 11:50.647
It's an effervescent inhaler.

11:50.730 --> 11:52.566
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

11:52.649 --> 11:54.734
Delivery's automatic.

11:54.818 --> 11:56.403
Some friends of mine made it.

11:56.987 --> 11:58.613
Friends?

11:58.697 --> 12:01.491
Yeah.
You remember those?

12:01.533 --> 12:03.034
<i>It was horrible.</i>

12:03.118 --> 12:06.538
<i>The one car crashed, and then the guy
in the coat was shooting the other guy.</i>

12:06.621 --> 12:08.957
<i>- It looked like there was a lot of blood.
- Thank you.</i>

12:09.082 --> 12:11.251
<i>That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred</i>

12:11.334 --> 12:13.044
<i>during tonight's brazen shootout</i>

12:13.086 --> 12:15.338
<i>that left at least four people dead.</i>

12:15.422 --> 12:17.299
<i>Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen</i>

12:17.382 --> 12:19.175
<i>captured the whole event on video.</i>

12:19.259 --> 12:21.052
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.

12:21.136 --> 12:22.596
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

12:22.637 --> 12:24.347
It's time to take these cowboys down.

12:24.382 --> 12:25.974
That's what I'm talkin' about.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.426
What's he been doing?

13:01.509 --> 13:03.219
Fuck all. Just feeding.

13:03.303 --> 13:04.888
Been through five of them so far.

13:04.971 --> 13:06.514
Do you think we have enough security?

13:06.598 --> 13:09.809
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.

13:09.851 --> 13:10.894
You understand?

13:10.977 --> 13:12.395
I'm gonna go in.

14:22.007 --> 14:24.009
You shouldn't have woken me.

14:24.926 --> 14:26.136
We had to.

14:31.016 --> 14:35.270
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

14:36.479 --> 14:38.690
What makes you think I care?

14:38.815 --> 14:40.108
Your people need you.

14:40.191 --> 14:41.526
My people?

14:44.905 --> 14:48.700
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

14:48.742 --> 14:51.077
Look how far you have fallen.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.330
The world's changed since your time.

14:53.455 --> 14:55.248
The humans have a new hunter.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.209
Blade.

14:58.335 --> 15:01.379
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?

15:01.463 --> 15:03.632
Yes.

15:31.576 --> 15:32.577
Subject is heading west.

15:33.662 --> 15:34.788
Got him.

15:37.374 --> 15:41.419
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist

15:41.503 --> 15:47.259
<i>and author of the New York Times
bestseller Human Health,</i>

15:47.342 --> 15:49.511
<i>The Whole Being Breakthrough.</i>

15:49.594 --> 15:53.598
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.

15:53.682 --> 15:57.435
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,

15:57.519 --> 16:00.939
<i>next on Bently Tittle Live.</i>

16:02.107 --> 16:03.448
Ok
Chief Vreede.

16:03.483 --> 16:07.404
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?

16:08.363 --> 16:11.741
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?

16:13.660 --> 16:16.705
They should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

16:16.740 --> 16:17.504
Now, that's the guy I wanna hear about.

16:17.539 --> 16:20.333
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

16:20.709 --> 16:23.211
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.

16:23.461 --> 16:27.132
Blade is a troubled individual.

16:27.340 --> 16:29.801
I understand that he is
under the impression

16:30.260 --> 16:32.262
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.

16:35.348 --> 16:37.726
Now, you've got to look
at the psychiatric underpinnings

16:40.896 --> 16:43.398
Congratulations.
You're famous.

16:43.481 --> 16:44.941
Somebody nailed us.

16:45.025 --> 16:47.611
Your face is all over the papers
and television.

16:47.736 --> 16:49.446
Media's eatin' it up.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.197
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

16:51.281 --> 16:55.076
Something like this-
taking out a human-

16:55.118 --> 16:57.787
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

16:57.871 --> 17:00.081
you're public enemy number one.

17:00.123 --> 17:03.084
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.796
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?

17:06.880 --> 17:09.965
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. Campaign.

17:10.050 --> 17:13.261
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,

17:13.303 --> 17:16.473
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.

17:18.141 --> 17:21.435
You worry too much, old man.

17:21.519 --> 17:23.771
That's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

17:24.481 --> 17:27.358
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.152
You're like a son to me.

17:29.861 --> 17:32.030
I'm sorry I got old on ya.

17:32.113 --> 17:35.283
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

17:35.367 --> 17:37.285
And it breaks my heart.

17:38.828 --> 17:40.789
We can't win this war alone.

17:42.958 --> 17:45.460
Oh, got it! Got it!

17:46.378 --> 17:47.427
Baby on board.

17:47.462 --> 17:51.299
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!

18:05.522 --> 18:08.233
Chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky!

18:56.656 --> 18:58.783
Oh, yeah, baby!

18:58.867 --> 19:00.702
What's for dinner?

19:12.714 --> 19:13.840
Aah!

19:14.215 --> 19:15.717
Hey, pretty lady.

19:23.183 --> 19:25.477
No! No!

19:26.686 --> 19:27.812
No!

19:31.024 --> 19:33.151
Scream if this hurts, chica.

19:36.613 --> 19:38.073
Aah!

19:38.448 --> 19:39.991
Fuck you?

19:40.075 --> 19:42.869
Aah!

19:42.953 --> 19:44.579
Garlic!

20:46.766 --> 20:49.060
<i>Scream if this hurts, chica.</i>

20:51.855 --> 20:54.190
Aah!

21:57.671 --> 21:58.797
What is it?

22:00.131 --> 22:01.716
What you were worried about.

22:18.984 --> 22:20.485
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

22:24.489 --> 22:26.241
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

23:03.987 --> 23:05.238
Aah!

23:59.918 --> 24:01.670
Move a finger and you're dead.

24:01.753 --> 24:03.463
How's about this one?

24:03.546 --> 24:04.923
He's got something in his hand!

24:05.048 --> 24:06.424
Get out, Blade!

24:12.055 --> 24:13.098
Shit!

24:29.281 --> 24:30.824
What's going on in there?

24:30.907 --> 24:32.284
Somebody talk to me!

24:35.996 --> 24:40.333
Aah!

24:40.458 --> 24:41.876
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

25:28.423 --> 25:31.384
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

25:36.264 --> 25:39.684
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.

25:39.768 --> 25:42.312
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

25:42.938 --> 25:44.439
Whistler.

25:44.522 --> 25:45.732
Dead.

25:47.651 --> 25:49.319
Just like all your victims.

25:51.029 --> 25:52.739
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?

25:52.822 --> 25:55.158
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

25:56.493 --> 25:58.703
1,182.

25:59.454 --> 26:01.998
But they were all familiars.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.084
People who work with them.

26:04.167 --> 26:08.004
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

26:12.425 --> 26:15.887
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.

26:15.929 --> 26:17.472
It's not gonna play.

26:17.889 --> 26:19.975
We know what you are.

26:20.058 --> 26:21.810
You're a stone-cold killer.

26:21.893 --> 26:23.562
And you're sick as fuck.

26:23.603 --> 26:26.189
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

26:27.774 --> 26:29.109
Hello, Blade.

26:29.734 --> 26:30.986
My name is Dr. Vance.

26:31.069 --> 26:34.864
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.

26:35.657 --> 26:39.202
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

26:39.286 --> 26:41.121
He's all yours.

26:53.091 --> 26:55.594
I know you must find this
very frightening...

26:56.761 --> 26:59.264
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

27:00.390 --> 27:02.100
And in order for me to do that,

27:02.142 --> 27:06.396
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

27:06.730 --> 27:08.315
Do you know what day it is?

27:12.569 --> 27:16.573
<i>How about the President?
You know who that is.</i>

27:16.608 --> 27:17.073
An asshole.

27:24.289 --> 27:27.375
<i>But I want to hear you
talk about vampires.</i>

27:27.584 --> 27:29.377
What can you tell me about them?

27:31.755 --> 27:33.465
They exist.

27:34.799 --> 27:36.134
Are you one of them?

27:39.763 --> 27:41.723
Tell me about blood.

27:41.765 --> 27:43.725
When you drink blood,

27:43.808 --> 27:46.728
do you ever feel sexually aroused?

27:51.107 --> 27:55.237
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism

27:55.320 --> 27:58.949
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

28:06.206 --> 28:11.002
And I'm wondering what your
relationship with your mother was like.

28:11.037 --> 28:11.037
A nocturnal visit.

28:13.964 --> 28:15.382
Were the two of you very close?

28:23.974 --> 28:25.225
He's psychotic.

28:25.267 --> 28:26.309
No shit.

28:26.351 --> 28:27.519
For his safety and for the public's,

28:27.602 --> 28:29.896
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric-

28:30.021 --> 28:31.731
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.

28:31.815 --> 28:34.067
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.

28:34.150 --> 28:36.403
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

28:36.486 --> 28:38.905
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

28:38.989 --> 28:40.907
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.

28:40.949 --> 28:42.200
Don't fuck with my thing!

28:42.242 --> 28:45.036
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

28:45.078 --> 28:47.038
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.

28:47.122 --> 28:48.081
Not this time.

28:53.461 --> 28:57.257
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

28:59.217 --> 29:02.429
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,

29:02.512 --> 29:07.517
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,

29:07.601 --> 29:10.103
I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

29:10.186 --> 29:12.647
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?

29:15.233 --> 29:16.484
There.

29:16.568 --> 29:18.028
That wasn't so bad, was it?

29:20.238 --> 29:22.115
Ooh, you're weak.

29:22.866 --> 29:24.701
In need of your serum.

29:25.869 --> 29:27.454
That must be a bad feeling.

29:28.872 --> 29:31.416
I mean, who would've imagined

29:31.499 --> 29:34.586
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.

29:37.255 --> 29:39.299
You're one of them.

29:40.675 --> 29:42.344
A familiar.

29:46.306 --> 29:48.475
Going on five years now.

29:52.145 --> 29:54.189
It's the endgame, Blade.

29:54.814 --> 29:57.275
All their plans are coming to fruition.

29:58.026 --> 30:01.947
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

30:09.287 --> 30:13.166
I hate familiars.

30:22.759 --> 30:25.595
<i>It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.</i>

30:25.845 --> 30:28.139
<i>You're like a son to me.</i>

30:30.433 --> 30:34.729
<i>Sorry I got old on ya.</i>

30:35.939 --> 30:40.318
<i>I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.</i>

30:40.402 --> 30:42.362
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

31:08.722 --> 31:10.015
Hi, Blade.

31:10.056 --> 31:11.892
So glad to finally meet you.

31:11.975 --> 31:13.935
I am such a fan.

31:15.145 --> 31:17.272
I like your tattoos.

31:18.189 --> 31:19.733
Do they mean anything?

31:20.942 --> 31:22.152
Stupid.

31:22.819 --> 31:24.529
Are you okay?

31:24.613 --> 31:26.323
Are you tired?

31:28.366 --> 31:29.409
You're weak.

31:33.330 --> 31:36.249
We moved the humans around.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.543
Like pawns.

31:39.669 --> 31:41.087
We used them...

31:41.880 --> 31:43.506
...to flush you out.

31:52.891 --> 31:54.226
You're not so big.

31:56.394 --> 31:58.313
You're all alone, Blade.

31:59.314 --> 32:01.441
No one's gonna help you now.

32:22.671 --> 32:25.173
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

32:29.177 --> 32:30.679
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.

33:19.436 --> 33:20.520
Go!

34:08.109 --> 34:09.444
Freeze!

34:23.583 --> 34:24.751
Whistler!

34:25.960 --> 34:27.337
This way!

34:35.679 --> 34:37.097
Blade!

34:37.138 --> 34:38.681
You're dead!

34:39.349 --> 34:40.559
Get down!

34:47.940 --> 34:48.984
Blade.

34:56.658 --> 34:57.867
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:57.951 --> 34:58.952
Where are you going?

34:59.035 --> 35:00.745
Where the fuck is he going?

35:00.829 --> 35:03.039
This is supposed to be a rescue!

35:09.296 --> 35:10.422
Get back, get back!

35:13.592 --> 35:14.676
We're pinned down.

35:14.801 --> 35:15.927
I can't shoot around corners.

35:15.969 --> 35:17.053
<i>I can.</i>

35:56.051 --> 35:57.969
Aah!

36:20.575 --> 36:22.827
Okay. We're fucked.

36:22.911 --> 36:24.037
We're fine.

36:36.925 --> 36:39.010
Forgot my sword.

36:47.811 --> 36:49.521
Whoo! Come on!

37:04.119 --> 37:05.495
Abby.

37:08.290 --> 37:09.958
Aah!

37:12.460 --> 37:13.670
We got him.

37:13.712 --> 37:15.380
We'll be there soon.

37:15.463 --> 37:17.215
Who the hell are you people?

37:17.257 --> 37:20.093
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

37:20.176 --> 37:22.512
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

37:23.054 --> 37:24.389
Whistler's daughter.

37:37.027 --> 37:39.696
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

37:39.779 --> 37:43.325
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.

37:45.410 --> 37:47.662
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,

37:47.746 --> 37:49.122
and I told him I wanted in.

37:49.164 --> 37:51.708
Been doing it ever since.

37:58.423 --> 38:00.467
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

38:01.593 --> 38:03.595
How do you bankroll this operation?

38:03.678 --> 38:05.180
I date a lot of older men.

38:06.598 --> 38:08.558
Come on, man, I'm joking.

38:08.642 --> 38:10.352
You met Dex.

38:10.435 --> 38:11.728
This is Hedges.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.689
Sommerfield- she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

38:14.773 --> 38:19.945
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.

38:22.030 --> 38:23.823
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

38:24.532 --> 38:27.953
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.

38:28.036 --> 38:31.831
We were gonna go with
the Care Bears, but, uh, that was taken.

38:35.418 --> 38:36.628
How many of you are there?

38:36.711 --> 38:37.837
There's enough.

38:37.879 --> 38:39.548
We operate in sleeper cells.

38:39.631 --> 38:42.050
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

38:42.133 --> 38:44.928
Consider us your reinforcements.

38:46.263 --> 38:48.723
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?

38:50.892 --> 38:52.352
You?

38:53.436 --> 38:54.729
Look at you.

38:54.813 --> 38:56.106
You're kids.

38:56.898 --> 38:58.525
You're not ready to roll with this.

38:59.109 --> 39:01.111
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.

39:02.153 --> 39:03.947
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

39:04.781 --> 39:06.992
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."

39:07.075 --> 39:08.451
It's a joke, huh?

39:09.244 --> 39:11.580
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

39:11.621 --> 39:14.332
You think this is a fucking sitcom?

39:14.833 --> 39:17.419
Okay, first off, that's just rude.

39:17.502 --> 39:21.339
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

39:23.884 --> 39:25.677
I'm impressed.

39:25.719 --> 39:28.889
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.

39:28.972 --> 39:31.892
Like it or not, we are all you got.

39:32.475 --> 39:35.228
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?

39:35.312 --> 39:39.024
Well, here's for starters.

39:39.774 --> 39:41.234
I used to be one.

39:42.611 --> 39:44.070
Do I pass the audition?

39:45.864 --> 39:47.240
Rookies.

39:48.074 --> 39:50.452
Fucking Hannibal King!

39:50.535 --> 39:54.247
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!

39:55.624 --> 39:56.958
Ugh!

39:58.752 --> 40:00.128
Ugh!

40:02.047 --> 40:03.798
We had Blade.

40:03.882 --> 40:05.258
We had him!

40:05.342 --> 40:06.635
Ugh!

40:07.260 --> 40:10.180
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

40:10.263 --> 40:12.182
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?

40:12.265 --> 40:13.475
Blow me.

40:14.893 --> 40:17.062
We got caught with our pants down.

40:17.145 --> 40:18.521
Pants down?

40:18.605 --> 40:21.775
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.

40:21.858 --> 40:23.276
Oh, you loved it.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.986
Has he been told?

40:25.737 --> 40:27.656
About your failure?

40:28.865 --> 40:29.866
Yes.

40:31.743 --> 40:33.870
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

40:40.919 --> 40:44.172
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

40:44.965 --> 40:47.968
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,

40:48.051 --> 40:52.097
but you still manage to ask
for her number.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.140
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

40:54.224 --> 40:55.976
<i>But this betty...</i>

40:56.935 --> 41:01.273
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

41:01.815 --> 41:03.525
Her name is Danica Talos.

41:03.608 --> 41:05.151
You met her earlier.

41:05.277 --> 41:08.780
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

41:11.575 --> 41:13.159
Moving on.

41:13.243 --> 41:16.162
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,

41:16.246 --> 41:19.749
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

41:19.833 --> 41:21.501
I picked Danica up in a bar

41:21.585 --> 41:23.753
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck

41:23.879 --> 41:26.339
as her little vampire cabana boy.

41:26.423 --> 41:28.925
Eventually, Abigail found me.

41:28.967 --> 41:32.596
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

41:34.180 --> 41:37.100
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.

41:38.935 --> 41:41.146
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

41:42.022 --> 41:43.148
"We"?

41:45.233 --> 41:46.568
Yeah, we.

41:47.402 --> 41:49.195
He's come back.

41:51.781 --> 41:53.199
Take a look at this.

41:58.413 --> 41:59.831
You gotta be kidding me.

42:03.293 --> 42:05.260
He is real.
BLADE BABA

42:05.295 --> 42:06.504
This is a piece of his armor.

42:06.588 --> 42:10.050
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

42:10.175 --> 42:11.384
Check this out.

42:12.552 --> 42:15.096
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

42:15.138 --> 42:19.434
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.

42:19.517 --> 42:22.896
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

42:31.529 --> 42:35.450
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.

42:39.621 --> 42:41.039
He was the first of his kind.

42:42.082 --> 42:45.710
<i>The patriarch of hominus nocturna.</i>

42:51.132 --> 42:53.635
He was born perfect.

42:56.596 --> 43:01.560
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.

43:02.143 --> 43:03.770
Forget the movies, forget the books.

43:03.853 --> 43:05.522
There's no happy ending with this guy.

43:08.191 --> 43:10.360
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,

43:10.402 --> 43:14.864
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...

43:17.284 --> 43:18.451
...just like that...

43:22.163 --> 43:24.457
...he up and disappeared.

43:24.583 --> 43:26.209
And then we heard a rumor.

43:26.293 --> 43:28.420
The vampires were searching for him.

43:28.545 --> 43:30.964
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,

43:31.047 --> 43:34.134
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

43:34.217 --> 43:38.471
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

43:38.513 --> 43:40.348
And he was pissed.

44:05.290 --> 44:08.627
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal

44:08.668 --> 44:11.338
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

44:11.421 --> 44:14.591
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

44:14.674 --> 44:17.594
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

44:17.677 --> 44:20.472
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

44:20.555 --> 44:24.059
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

44:37.572 --> 44:39.866
In the window...

44:39.908 --> 44:42.285
You sell vampire merchandise?

44:44.621 --> 44:45.872
Uh, yeah.

44:45.956 --> 44:47.332
Look around.

44:47.415 --> 44:49.084
We might have a few things.

44:52.045 --> 44:53.713
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

44:53.797 --> 44:55.131
Did you see those?

44:55.215 --> 44:58.843
There's bobble heads, key chains.

44:59.344 --> 45:02.055
We've got just about anything.

45:02.138 --> 45:04.975
Even vampire vibrators.

45:08.770 --> 45:11.648
Was there something special
you needed?

45:13.525 --> 45:14.609
Hey, guy.

45:15.527 --> 45:16.987
She's talkin' to ya.

45:24.744 --> 45:26.288
What?

45:26.371 --> 45:28.290
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

45:28.373 --> 45:30.876
Aah!

45:30.959 --> 45:32.085
No!

45:32.168 --> 45:34.296
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

45:34.337 --> 45:37.591
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

45:37.674 --> 45:39.926
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

45:40.010 --> 45:45.140
Aah!

45:45.307 --> 45:48.602
Aah!

45:55.984 --> 45:59.404
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

46:00.071 --> 46:01.197
Why wake up Drake now?

46:01.281 --> 46:03.366
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.

46:03.450 --> 46:04.701
When I was under the fang,

46:04.784 --> 46:08.830
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

46:08.872 --> 46:10.874
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.

46:10.957 --> 46:12.959
I mean, that makes no sense, right?

46:13.001 --> 46:14.586
They've always had plans
for the human race,

46:14.669 --> 46:17.172
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,

46:17.214 --> 46:19.049
Drake's return is part of it.

46:19.132 --> 46:20.091
Let's face it.

46:20.175 --> 46:22.302
We are fighting a losing battle here.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.888
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year- big deal.

46:24.971 --> 46:27.933
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

46:28.016 --> 46:29.226
We need a new tactic.

46:29.309 --> 46:30.477
Like what?

46:30.602 --> 46:32.062
A biological weapon.

46:33.772 --> 46:35.232
For you sighted people...

46:37.901 --> 46:39.986
...here's a little show and tell.

46:40.070 --> 46:42.614
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA

46:42.697 --> 46:46.660
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

46:46.743 --> 46:48.828
We're calling it DayStar.

46:48.912 --> 46:50.538
Think about it, Blade.

46:51.248 --> 46:53.750
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.

46:53.833 --> 46:55.585
So what's been holding you back?

46:55.627 --> 46:58.004
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

46:58.088 --> 47:01.216
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.

47:02.092 --> 47:04.135
We need Dracula's blood.

47:04.177 --> 47:06.805
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,

47:06.888 --> 47:09.272
his DNA is still pure.

47:09.307 --> 47:13.979
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

47:14.062 --> 47:19.859
We get his blood, we can boost
DayStar's viral efficacy to 100%.

47:19.943 --> 47:22.112
All the vampires go bye-bye.

47:23.321 --> 47:26.324
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up

47:26.408 --> 47:28.660
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

47:34.541 --> 47:35.584
Oh.

47:35.667 --> 47:37.043
Holy shit.

47:37.085 --> 47:39.838
Um, gentlemen and hottie,

47:39.921 --> 47:42.716
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery

47:42.799 --> 47:44.801
for your viewing pleasure today.

47:44.926 --> 47:48.638
Electronic pistol- comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.

47:49.639 --> 47:51.057
Explosive rounds.

47:51.141 --> 47:53.268
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light

47:53.351 --> 47:55.312
instead of your standard hollow points.

47:55.395 --> 47:57.147
I call 'em sun dogs.

47:57.230 --> 48:00.442
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.

48:02.903 --> 48:05.322
This little pea shooter-
it's a modified version

48:05.363 --> 48:08.116
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.

48:08.199 --> 48:09.910
Pick your poison- sun dogs, stakes,

48:09.993 --> 48:11.536
heat-seeking mini rockets.

48:11.620 --> 48:14.956
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.

48:15.040 --> 48:18.001
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

48:19.711 --> 48:20.795
Oh, God.

48:20.879 --> 48:23.298
Over here, we, um-

48:23.381 --> 48:27.093
we call this the UV Arc.

48:27.135 --> 48:29.304
Whoa. Sorry.

48:29.387 --> 48:32.265
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser-

48:32.307 --> 48:34.351
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

48:35.936 --> 48:37.604
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

48:37.646 --> 48:41.024
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

48:41.066 --> 48:44.402
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

48:44.486 --> 48:46.821
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.

48:46.905 --> 48:50.408
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.

48:51.117 --> 48:53.703
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,

48:53.787 --> 48:57.749
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

48:58.625 --> 49:01.253
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

49:01.378 --> 49:04.631
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones-

49:04.714 --> 49:08.176
I have a- I have a question
about that, Hedges.

49:08.260 --> 49:10.136
Have you ever been laid?

49:10.929 --> 49:12.681
Many times.

49:12.764 --> 49:13.848
With ladies.

49:15.767 --> 49:17.352
Time for a little pressure.

49:18.061 --> 49:20.730
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command

49:20.772 --> 49:22.899
has always been their familiars.

49:22.983 --> 49:25.235
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,

49:25.318 --> 49:28.113
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.

49:28.196 --> 49:30.115
We bleed the wannabes...

49:30.824 --> 49:33.034
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

49:33.702 --> 49:35.287
I got you some new wheels.

49:35.370 --> 49:36.830
You take care of it now.

49:43.003 --> 49:44.379
She's making playlists.

49:45.255 --> 49:47.299
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

49:47.424 --> 49:49.801
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?

49:49.885 --> 49:53.930
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

49:54.639 --> 49:57.475
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?

49:59.352 --> 50:01.563
Come on, come on
like that, ya'll

50:03.607 --> 50:05.734
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all

50:06.776 --> 50:08.778
Let me see you say ho

50:30.592 --> 50:32.761
Let me see you say ho

50:37.682 --> 50:41.561
Aah!

50:45.565 --> 50:47.400
Ah! Aah!

50:53.198 --> 50:55.700
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

50:55.784 --> 50:58.078
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.

50:58.161 --> 50:59.371
Who's your handler?

50:59.454 --> 51:00.997
I don't know my fucking handler.

51:01.081 --> 51:02.874
I swear. I swear!

51:02.958 --> 51:05.126
Oh, shit! Please! Please!

51:09.965 --> 51:11.424
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

51:12.175 --> 51:13.260
I'll take that.

51:14.135 --> 51:15.095
Come on!

51:15.178 --> 51:16.680
Let's go! Come on!

51:20.892 --> 51:23.144
<i>Hello?</i>

51:24.771 --> 51:27.190
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

51:28.692 --> 51:29.651
It's for you.

51:29.734 --> 51:31.111
Yeah, go ahead.

51:31.695 --> 51:33.363
Hello?

51:33.446 --> 51:35.824
Aah!

51:36.616 --> 51:38.368
You know, at some point, you, uh,

51:38.451 --> 51:40.787
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.

51:40.870 --> 51:42.831
You know? Have a little share time?

51:42.873 --> 51:45.250
Kick back?
Get in touch with your inner child?

51:45.333 --> 51:46.334
That sort of thing?

51:46.418 --> 51:50.964
Also- just a thought- but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.

51:55.969 --> 52:00.015
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.

52:17.365 --> 52:18.366
Hey.

52:18.450 --> 52:20.702
You just can't walk in here like- aah!

52:28.543 --> 52:29.669
Excuse me, sir.

52:36.927 --> 52:38.178
Don't do that.

52:56.029 --> 52:57.030
Where's Vance?

52:57.113 --> 52:59.199
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.

53:08.416 --> 53:09.584
Sit.

53:14.464 --> 53:15.799
Can I, uh, can I help you?

53:15.840 --> 53:18.009
Remember me?
Time for payback.

53:18.093 --> 53:20.428
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?

53:23.098 --> 53:24.182
Oh, Jesus.

53:24.266 --> 53:25.433
It's him.

53:25.517 --> 53:27.227
Abby. It's Drake!

53:33.441 --> 53:35.610
Aah!

53:42.867 --> 53:45.537
So, you're the hunter they all fear.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.080
I had a feeling about you.

53:47.163 --> 53:48.415
Just shoot him!

53:48.498 --> 53:50.083
Go ahead, Blade.

53:50.166 --> 53:51.501
Show me what you're made of.

53:51.585 --> 53:52.627
Aah!

55:21.841 --> 55:24.344
Aah! Oh, my God!

55:24.427 --> 55:26.555
He got my baby!

55:26.638 --> 55:29.474
Aah! No! My baby!

56:29.075 --> 56:31.328
Ah, careful, Daywalker.

56:31.411 --> 56:33.371
I've been told about you.

56:33.455 --> 56:35.498
Your weakness for humans.

56:35.582 --> 56:37.125
Why'd you kill Vance?

56:37.209 --> 56:39.461
He'd outlived his purpose.

56:40.003 --> 56:41.087
He died a good death.

56:41.421 --> 56:43.131
Quick, clean.

56:43.215 --> 56:45.217
I wouldn't know anything about that.

56:45.300 --> 56:46.676
You will.

56:48.511 --> 56:51.139
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

56:51.181 --> 56:53.475
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

56:54.476 --> 56:57.229
I was the first of the vampires.

56:58.647 --> 57:00.440
I am unique.

57:00.523 --> 57:01.983
So that's why they brought you back.

57:02.108 --> 57:03.443
Of course.

57:03.526 --> 57:06.613
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

57:12.118 --> 57:13.620
Look at them down there.

57:13.703 --> 57:16.540
Scurrying around like insects.

57:17.165 --> 57:20.794
They don't know anything about honor
or living by the sword,

57:20.877 --> 57:22.504
not like you and I do.

57:23.046 --> 57:26.550
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

57:26.675 --> 57:27.926
You're not immortal.

57:28.718 --> 57:32.305
I must've heard hundreds of you rodents
make the same claim.

57:33.014 --> 57:35.892
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

57:35.976 --> 57:37.936
Perhaps I will too, then,

57:38.019 --> 57:41.648
but I think it is more likely
the next time we meet,

57:41.690 --> 57:44.025
<i>you fall before mine.</i>

57:44.859 --> 57:46.111
Catch!

58:05.005 --> 58:06.423
Cootchie coo.

58:08.425 --> 58:09.509
Did you see that guy?

58:09.551 --> 58:11.136
We're gonna lose, man.
We're gonna-

58:11.219 --> 58:13.471
Oh! God!

58:13.513 --> 58:15.473
We're gonna fucking lose!

58:15.932 --> 58:16.975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

58:17.183 --> 58:18.852
What are you- what is that?
What are you doing?

58:18.887 --> 58:20.353
It's an elastic protein, okay?

58:20.437 --> 58:21.897
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

58:21.980 --> 58:23.064
Okay.

58:23.148 --> 58:24.274
Is it gonna hurt?

58:24.357 --> 58:26.192
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

58:26.234 --> 58:27.736
Really?

58:30.030 --> 58:32.032
Fuck me!

58:32.115 --> 58:33.283
Aah!

58:37.120 --> 58:38.955
<i>I had a family once.</i>

58:39.706 --> 58:42.083
<i>Wife, two daughters.</i>

58:46.463 --> 58:49.049
<i>Then a drifter came calling
one evening.</i>

58:50.383 --> 58:51.635
<i>A vampire.</i>

58:52.969 --> 58:55.263
<i>He toyed with 'em first.</i>

58:57.182 --> 59:01.144
<i>Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.</i>

59:02.479 --> 59:04.689
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

59:04.773 --> 59:07.025
<i>Since before you were born.</i>

59:08.151 --> 59:10.528
<i>I don't want this life for you, Abby.</i>

59:53.488 --> 59:54.781
Hey, Blade.

59:54.864 --> 59:57.534
I got a question for you.

59:57.617 --> 01:00:00.203
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

01:00:00.287 --> 01:00:01.872
What then, huh?

01:00:02.622 --> 01:00:04.541
You ever ask yourself that?

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:06.751
I mean, somehow,

01:00:06.835 --> 01:00:12.132
l- I don't picture you teaching karate
at the local Y.

01:00:22.934 --> 01:00:24.561
He hates me, doesn't he?

01:00:24.644 --> 01:00:25.937
Yeah.

01:00:40.827 --> 01:00:42.245
Why do you do that?

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:47.334
Because there's something bad
inside of me.

01:00:48.877 --> 01:00:50.837
This keeps it from getting out.

01:00:50.921 --> 01:00:53.006
Why can't you just be nice?

01:00:58.637 --> 01:01:00.972
Because the world isn't nice.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:08.271
I found where the vampires are working.

01:01:08.605 --> 01:01:10.774
Biomedica Enterprises.

01:01:10.857 --> 01:01:13.652
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

01:01:13.735 --> 01:01:15.278
Check it out.

01:01:16.279 --> 01:01:18.031
Taq polymerase,

01:01:18.114 --> 01:01:20.992
bone marrow growth supplement,

01:01:21.034 --> 01:01:24.037
genetic sequencing enzymes.

01:01:25.205 --> 01:01:26.790
You want a party favor?

01:01:26.873 --> 01:01:28.416
Lucky seven.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.126
Silver hollow points.

01:01:30.168 --> 01:01:31.711
Done.

01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:02.576
You wanted to see me?

01:02:03.451 --> 01:02:04.786
We've got trouble.

01:02:05.328 --> 01:02:07.622
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

01:02:07.664 --> 01:02:09.165
Shit!

01:02:20.886 --> 01:02:22.345
What are you doing here?

01:02:22.929 --> 01:02:23.972
Talk.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.683
Talk.

01:02:30.395 --> 01:02:31.771
Spill it!

01:02:31.855 --> 01:02:33.064
You know what we're doing.

01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:35.233
What's inside?

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:38.653
Aah!

01:02:42.991 --> 01:02:45.785
Now, what's behind door number one?

01:02:47.787 --> 01:02:49.831
I can't tell you.
They- they'll kill me.

01:02:49.915 --> 01:02:52.042
<i>Kill you?
Motherfucker, I'll kill you.</i>

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.627
I'll just enjoy it better.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.511
You know the routine.

01:03:20.487 --> 01:03:21.738
Lights.

01:03:24.908 --> 01:03:26.034
God in Heaven.

01:03:42.008 --> 01:03:43.677
What is this place?

01:03:44.636 --> 01:03:46.680
It's a blood farming facility.

01:03:52.852 --> 01:03:56.982
Vampires decided that hunting humans
on a piecemeal basis was...

01:03:57.023 --> 01:03:58.358
too inefficient.

01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:02.320
Why kill your prey
when you can keep them alive?

01:04:05.574 --> 01:04:07.576
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate

01:04:07.617 --> 01:04:10.412
anywhere from 50 to 100
pints of blood.

01:04:11.037 --> 01:04:12.706
Productive.

01:04:14.457 --> 01:04:16.042
Where do you get all these people?

01:04:17.711 --> 01:04:20.630
They got processing centers
in every major city.

01:04:20.672 --> 01:04:22.883
At any given time, there's what,

01:04:22.966 --> 01:04:26.678
two, three million homeless
wandering around America?

01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:28.638
They just pull 'em in off the streets.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.434
Nobody cares about them.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.062
We're doing this country
a service, really.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.192
Vampire final solution.

01:04:42.193 --> 01:04:44.237
Are they aware?

01:04:44.321 --> 01:04:46.281
Do they feel anything?

01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:49.242
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

01:04:49.326 --> 01:04:50.869
They're brain dead.

01:04:54.664 --> 01:04:56.082
Look at this.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.460
This the future you want?

01:04:58.543 --> 01:05:02.923
<i>Don't you think that they have
a place for you in their future?</i>

01:05:03.632 --> 01:05:05.300
We don't have a choice!

01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:08.803
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

01:05:09.346 --> 01:05:10.555
He's come back!

01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:12.891
There's nothing stopping them now.

01:05:12.974 --> 01:05:14.476
There's me.

01:05:15.644 --> 01:05:16.895
Go!

01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:20.315
You got 20 seconds.

01:05:23.193 --> 01:05:24.569
Twenty.

01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:33.495
Shutdown password- what is it?

01:05:33.578 --> 01:05:35.288
Harvest.

01:05:36.456 --> 01:05:37.457
Put it in.

01:05:53.515 --> 01:05:54.641
Let's go.

01:06:07.195 --> 01:06:10.156
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

01:06:10.198 --> 01:06:12.909
- Oh! You win.
- One more, one more.

01:06:12.993 --> 01:06:16.746
"Now, Nome King,
having never tried to be good,

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:19.583
was very bad indeed."

01:06:20.709 --> 01:06:23.545
"Having decided to conquer
the land of Oz

01:06:23.587 --> 01:06:27.215
and to destroy the Emerald City..."

01:06:34.097 --> 01:06:35.640
This ain't no video game.

01:06:35.807 --> 01:06:37.183
This ain't no video game.

01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:42.272
Come on, now.

01:07:08.048 --> 01:07:11.092
Dude, you're dead.

01:07:18.683 --> 01:07:21.019
Mom, the lights are weird.

01:07:22.604 --> 01:07:23.897
What do you mean?

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.482
They're going on and off.

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.612
Guys?

01:07:32.072 --> 01:07:35.242
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

01:07:35.283 --> 01:07:37.869
Like we talked about. Go on.

01:10:15.402 --> 01:10:17.195
Something's not right.

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:34.981
Zoe?

01:11:38.109 --> 01:11:39.319
Whistler.

01:12:55.812 --> 01:12:57.355
Use it.

01:12:59.816 --> 01:13:01.109
Use it.

01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:07.282
Use it.

01:13:12.078 --> 01:13:14.956
Aah!

01:13:28.345 --> 01:13:30.013
Back off, pooch.

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:36.102
Jesus Christ!

01:13:37.562 --> 01:13:39.147
What the fuck?!

01:13:39.231 --> 01:13:40.523
Good dog.

01:13:40.607 --> 01:13:43.151
What the fuck?!

01:13:46.363 --> 01:13:47.614
His name's Pac-Man.

01:13:48.698 --> 01:13:52.619
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species- experimenting.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:56.665
You made a goddamn
vampire Pomeranian?

01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.292
Yeah.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.841
Precious, isn't he?

01:14:06.925 --> 01:14:09.177
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly,

01:14:09.219 --> 01:14:11.263
this dog has a bigger dick than you.

01:14:12.389 --> 01:14:16.434
And when the fuck
did you see my dick, fuckface?

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.354
Ow!

01:14:19.396 --> 01:14:22.023
<i>I was talking to her!</i>

01:14:25.777 --> 01:14:27.612
Poor King.

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:31.825
You look so distraught!

01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:37.622
Give me that chair.

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:48.925
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:51.970
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

01:14:52.012 --> 01:14:54.973
Have you tried lake trout?

01:14:55.056 --> 01:14:56.766
Mackerel?

01:14:56.850 --> 01:15:00.228
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck

01:15:00.312 --> 01:15:02.397
off the end of my dick?

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.527
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

01:15:07.611 --> 01:15:10.363
It provokes my envy.

01:15:18.163 --> 01:15:20.081
Tell us about Blade, King.

01:15:20.165 --> 01:15:22.834
What's this weapon
he's been planning?

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.462
I can tell you two things.

01:15:27.088 --> 01:15:33.053
One... your hairdo is ridiculous.

01:15:34.137 --> 01:15:39.434
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

01:15:39.476 --> 01:15:41.019
Silent but deadly.

01:15:42.479 --> 01:15:44.856
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.941
All right! Fuck!

01:15:46.024 --> 01:15:47.734
I'll tell you about the weapon.

01:15:56.159 --> 01:15:57.661
It's a new flavor crystal formula.

01:15:57.702 --> 01:15:59.579
Twice the chocolaty goodness,
half the calories.

01:15:59.663 --> 01:16:01.456
Plus, it helps
prevent tooth decay. There.

01:16:11.049 --> 01:16:13.134
You're brave, King.

01:16:13.218 --> 01:16:14.678
I'll give you that.

01:16:15.762 --> 01:16:19.683
But underneath all that swagger,

01:16:19.766 --> 01:16:22.686
I know what you really fear.

01:16:23.186 --> 01:16:26.690
What would hurt you
more than anything else.

01:16:40.078 --> 01:16:44.958
You don't want to go back
to being one of us, do you?

01:16:53.341 --> 01:16:57.429
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

01:16:57.470 --> 01:17:02.267
And I'm gonna leave you here
while you turn.

01:17:02.309 --> 01:17:06.104
I'm going to watch you day after day

01:17:06.146 --> 01:17:10.567
as the thirst
keeps building and building.

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.613
And then,

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:18.408
when you can't stand it anymore...

01:17:23.914 --> 01:17:26.666
...I'm gonna bring the little girl in here...

01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:30.170
...for you to feed on.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:34.299
Would you like that, King?

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:39.054
Would you enjoy taking her life?

01:17:55.111 --> 01:17:57.113
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

01:18:19.302 --> 01:18:20.595
Are you all right?

01:18:21.888 --> 01:18:23.890
Yeah. I'll be fine.

01:18:26.518 --> 01:18:28.562
Don't let it turn inward.

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:33.942
I already has...

01:19:32.459 --> 01:19:33.752
He's one of ours.

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.337
My name is Caulder.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.464
I'll be your driver this evening.

01:19:47.265 --> 01:19:49.768
Sommerfield left you a video message.

01:19:53.813 --> 01:19:56.066
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm already dead.</i>

01:19:56.983 --> 01:20:01.655
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?</i>

01:20:01.738 --> 01:20:04.407
<i>I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.</i>

01:20:05.617 --> 01:20:08.119
<i>We just started reading
The Emerald City of Oz.</i>

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.622
<i>You know, the one
with the Nome King?</i>

01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:17.170
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the DayStar virus.</i>

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:20.382
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder</i>

01:20:20.465 --> 01:20:22.634
<i>in case our main stock was destroyed.</i>

01:20:23.468 --> 01:20:25.554
<i>In order for it
to achieve maximum lethality,</i>

01:20:25.637 --> 01:20:27.931
<i>you're gonna need to interfuse it
with Drake's blood.</i>

01:20:28.807 --> 01:20:32.811
<i>Now, if it works,
every vampire in the immediate vicinity</i>

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.396
<i>should die almost instantly.</i>

01:20:35.647 --> 01:20:37.148
<i>There's one other thing.</i>

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:40.485
<i>Blade, you need to know</i>

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:43.238
<i>that there's a chance
the virus could destroy you, too.</i>

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.531
<i>Because you're a hybrid,</i>

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:47.993
<i>l- I'm not sure if your immune system
will be able to tolerate it.</i>

01:20:49.202 --> 01:20:53.582
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn't have
enough time to properly test it.</i>

01:20:56.126 --> 01:20:59.754
So, shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

01:21:00.839 --> 01:21:04.342
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

01:21:05.218 --> 01:21:10.265
However, I was able to outfit it.

01:21:11.474 --> 01:21:13.643
A compressed gas projectile...

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:20.901
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

01:21:23.403 --> 01:21:27.032
Either way, you must be sure
that the shot counts.

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:30.410
You would simply not have enough
for a second shot.

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.088
Do you know who I am?

01:21:42.589 --> 01:21:44.216
You're the Nome King.

01:21:45.717 --> 01:21:46.760
Ah.

01:21:46.885 --> 01:21:48.887
The Nome King.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.931
How sweet.

01:21:51.014 --> 01:21:54.142
Tell me, child,
do you want to die?

01:21:54.226 --> 01:21:55.727
I'm not afraid.

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.312
I'll go to Heaven.

01:21:58.188 --> 01:21:59.397
There is no Heaven.

01:21:59.439 --> 01:22:02.859
No God, no angels.

01:22:02.943 --> 01:22:06.196
The only thing in your future
is nothingness.

01:22:06.279 --> 01:22:08.573
But what if you could change that?

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.576
What if you could
remain a child forever?

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:13.954
Wouldn't you like that?

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:15.997
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.293
My friends are coming to kill you.

01:22:42.983 --> 01:22:45.110
This blood

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:56.371
Wake the night!

01:23:04.296 --> 01:23:06.715
It's gonna wake the night

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.139
It's gonna wake the night

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:15.974
Wake the night!

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:17.934
This blood

01:23:21.146 --> 01:23:22.397
This blood

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.900
It's gonna wake the night

01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:27.110
This blood

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.905
This blood

01:23:29.988 --> 01:23:32.616
It's gonna wake the night!

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.299
- This blood
- Wake the night!

01:23:56.556 --> 01:23:58.266
It's gonna wake the night

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.692
- This blood
- Wake the night!

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:17.118
Wake the night!

01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:18.703
This blood

01:24:19.871 --> 01:24:22.165
This blood

01:24:22.207 --> 01:24:24.376
It's gonna wake the night!

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.929
Gonna be sorry you did that.

01:24:36.012 --> 01:24:37.013
Why?

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.810
Nobody's coming for you, Kingshit.

01:24:43.937 --> 01:24:44.938
Sure they are.

01:24:45.855 --> 01:24:46.856
God-

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:52.487
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers

01:24:52.529 --> 01:24:57.909
is that when you join our club, you get
all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

01:24:57.993 --> 01:25:02.747
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:05.959
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

01:25:09.254 --> 01:25:11.381
See, when one of us goes missing...

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:15.427
...the others,
they just dial up the satellite

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.220
which is in space.

01:25:17.262 --> 01:25:18.930
And then presto.

01:25:19.723 --> 01:25:21.641
Instant cavalry.

01:25:22.642 --> 01:25:23.977
You like that, huh?

01:25:25.312 --> 01:25:26.646
Go fuck your sister.

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.648
Okay, King.

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:33.361
Where is this tracking node of yours?

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:35.947
It's in my left ass check.

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:38.658
Fine.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.452
It's in my right ass cheek.

01:25:42.204 --> 01:25:44.331
Okay, I'm- okay, seriously, now.

01:25:45.457 --> 01:25:48.877
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

01:25:52.464 --> 01:25:55.383
Seriously, just pull down
my tighty-whities and see for yourself.

01:25:55.425 --> 01:25:56.426
Enough!

01:25:56.509 --> 01:25:58.220
It's not funny anymore!

01:25:58.303 --> 01:26:00.889
No, it's not,
you horse-humping bitch!

01:26:00.931 --> 01:26:03.391
But it will be a few seconds from now.

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:07.646
See, that tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

01:26:09.147 --> 01:26:11.816
...that's atomized colloidal silver.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.486
It's being pumped through
the building's air conditioning system,

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:17.322
you cock-juggling thundercunt!

01:26:26.373 --> 01:26:29.543
Which means the fat lady
should be singing

01:26:29.626 --> 01:26:33.296
right about now!

01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:43.098
This is awkward.

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.685
Do you have a cell phone?

01:27:11.167 --> 01:27:14.379
Um... a little help here.

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.882
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:27:58.924 --> 01:28:00.425
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

01:28:00.467 --> 01:28:01.843
Okay.

01:28:05.764 --> 01:28:06.848
Thank you.

01:28:08.099 --> 01:28:09.684
I brought your toys.

01:28:10.602 --> 01:28:12.020
Try to keep up.

01:28:31.248 --> 01:28:32.541
Aah!

01:30:20.273 --> 01:30:21.650
Abby!

01:30:21.775 --> 01:30:22.776
Hey.

01:30:24.277 --> 01:30:25.904
You okay?

01:30:25.946 --> 01:30:28.031
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.366
Watch out!

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:52.180
Fuck me.

01:30:54.975 --> 01:30:57.811
Oh, fuck me sideways!

01:31:01.731 --> 01:31:02.816
Oh, yeah.

01:31:03.441 --> 01:31:05.735
He's a cute little guy, aren't ya?

01:31:05.777 --> 01:31:06.987
Good little puppies.

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:09.030
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

01:31:09.072 --> 01:31:10.615
You stay.

01:31:10.657 --> 01:31:12.868
Oh. There's a pretty smile.

01:31:13.451 --> 01:31:14.536
Yeah.

01:31:14.619 --> 01:31:16.329
I'm going to, uh...

01:31:56.912 --> 01:31:58.288
Hey, dickface.

01:31:58.330 --> 01:32:00.207
You seen my dog?

01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:02.334
Have you tried the lobby?

01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:05.754
Thank you.

01:32:11.718 --> 01:32:12.969
Fuck...

01:32:13.011 --> 01:32:14.179
Come on, King.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.597
...this.

01:32:33.198 --> 01:32:34.574
Blade.

01:32:35.742 --> 01:32:37.369
Ready to die?

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.249
I was born ready, motherfucker.

01:32:45.043 --> 01:32:46.628
Motherfucker.

01:32:46.711 --> 01:32:48.213
I like that.

01:32:49.339 --> 01:32:51.633
Aah!

01:33:49.608 --> 01:33:51.401
Aah!

01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:07.209
Aah!

01:34:16.176 --> 01:34:18.136
Aah!

01:34:24.768 --> 01:34:26.603
You broke my arm!

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:25.180
Aah!

01:38:16.333 --> 01:38:18.793
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

01:39:43.753 --> 01:39:45.088
Give it up.

01:39:45.171 --> 01:39:46.673
Come on.
Give it up, King.

01:39:47.215 --> 01:39:49.509
Give it up.
Give it up.

01:39:49.551 --> 01:39:50.760
Give it up.

01:40:17.913 --> 01:40:19.331
Hang in there, kitten.

01:40:19.372 --> 01:40:20.749
I'll get help.

01:40:31.218 --> 01:40:33.345
Funny, isn't it?

01:40:33.887 --> 01:40:38.183
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire,

01:40:38.266 --> 01:40:41.436
when one already exists.

01:40:43.104 --> 01:40:44.773
I don't need to survive.

01:40:44.898 --> 01:40:48.068
The future of our race rests with you.

01:40:49.569 --> 01:40:51.404
You fought with honor.

01:40:51.446 --> 01:40:53.198
I respect that.

01:40:54.699 --> 01:40:56.660
Allow me a parting gift.

01:40:58.119 --> 01:40:59.621
But remember this.

01:41:00.455 --> 01:41:03.708
Sooner or later,

01:41:03.792 --> 01:41:07.295
the thirst always wins.

01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:37.005
Y o, yo

01:44:37.088 --> 01:44:39.090
It's the feast of the blood

01:44:39.174 --> 01:44:40.759
Unleash the beast within

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.720
I walk around with the strength
of a hundred men

01:44:44.471 --> 01:44:46.348
You best run before I count to ten

01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:49.601
Blood dripping from my canine
like a fountain pen

01:44:49.684 --> 01:44:52.562
The shape-shifting mirror image
flash phototype

01:44:52.604 --> 01:44:55.690
The everlasting vision,
the red battle type

01:45:26.555 --> 01:45:29.474
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

01:45:29.558 --> 01:45:32.477
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

01:45:32.519 --> 01:45:35.522
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

01:45:35.605 --> 01:45:38.817
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.819
Walk with me,
come on, walk with me

01:45:40.902 --> 01:45:43.780
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

01:45:43.947 --> 01:45:46.950
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

01:45:47.033 --> 01:45:50.203
Come on, walk with me,
walk with me

01:45:50.287 --> 01:45:53.707
I strike back with a vengeance,
The father, your descendants

01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:56.960
And I can't be deflected
by your silver cross pendants

01:45:57.043 --> 01:45:59.880
Bloody holy water,
you made the false images

01:45:59.921 --> 01:46:02.883
What's waiting for the sickle?
You're like the nemesis

01:46:02.924 --> 01:46:06.094
Sting like the scorpion,
strike with the force again

01:46:06.177 --> 01:46:09.639
My blood in those
who revitalize the corpse I'm in

01:46:09.723 --> 01:46:12.642
And the last thing,
they said the dead would walk again

01:46:12.726 --> 01:46:15.770
The blind, deaf and the dumb
will talk again

01:46:15.812 --> 01:46:18.273
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

01:46:18.398 --> 01:46:21.818
Trying to claim my fame,
that's fatal

01:46:21.902 --> 01:46:24.487
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

01:46:24.571 --> 01:46:27.616
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

01:47:05.362 --> 01:47:08.281
You don't even know me

01:47:08.323 --> 01:47:11.284
You can't even see me

01:47:11.326 --> 01:47:13.954
Friendlier than daylight

01:47:14.037 --> 01:47:16.915
Now I'm back,
now I'm back again

01:47:16.998 --> 01:47:19.876
Don't be scared, baby

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.171
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

01:47:23.255 --> 01:47:25.840
Friends of the daylight

01:47:25.966 --> 01:47:29.094
Let me drink,
let me drink, my friend

01:47:29.177 --> 01:47:31.972
Don't be scared, baby

01:47:32.055 --> 01:47:34.933
Don't be afraid

01:47:34.975 --> 01:47:37.811
Friends of the daylight

01:47:37.894 --> 01:47:40.897
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

01:47:40.939 --> 01:47:43.859
Never going nowhere

01:47:43.942 --> 01:47:47.153
You can't run from me

01:47:47.237 --> 01:47:49.865
Day or night, baby

01:47:49.948 --> 01:47:53.994
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

01:47:54.452 --> 01:47:56.329
Yeah

01:47:56.788 --> 01:48:01.293
Yeah

01:48:01.835 --> 01:48:05.463
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

01:48:05.547 --> 01:48:08.383
Don't be scared, baby

01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:11.011
Don't be scared, baby

01:48:11.052 --> 01:48:13.680
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

01:48:13.763 --> 01:48:16.099
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

01:48:16.183 --> 01:48:18.852
First things first, man,
you can't fight the thirst

01:48:18.935 --> 01:48:21.855
You can't call the doctor,
you can't call the nurse

01:48:21.938 --> 01:48:24.649
You got that Louis logo
on the side of your purse

01:48:24.733 --> 01:48:27.944
And those tight minis
about to make me burst

01:48:28.028 --> 01:48:30.947
I can't think,
let me sink into your jugular

01:48:30.989 --> 01:48:33.909
Come have a drink
with the thirsty love guzzler

01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:36.453
From the dark side,
baby, don't be afraid

01:48:36.494 --> 01:48:39.873
You can't fight the thirst
nor escape the plague

01:48:39.915 --> 01:48:43.084
I've been scopin' ya
hoping you'd be open to

01:48:43.126 --> 01:48:46.087
Take a sip of the potion
'cause it's overdue

01:48:46.171 --> 01:48:49.174
It's not your ordinary,
it's a special brew

01:48:49.257 --> 01:48:52.093
In the heat of the night,
I will rescue you

01:48:53.553 --> 01:48:56.056
Never going nowhere

01:48:56.139 --> 01:48:59.351
You can't run from me

01:48:59.392 --> 01:49:02.187
Day or night, baby

01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:06.024
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

01:49:06.858 --> 01:49:08.318
Yeah

01:49:08.944 --> 01:49:13.532
Yeah

01:49:14.115 --> 01:49:17.619
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

01:49:17.702 --> 01:49:20.372
Don't be scared, baby

01:49:20.539 --> 01:49:23.500
Don't be scared, baby

01:49:23.583 --> 01:49:26.127
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

01:49:26.211 --> 01:49:29.422
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

01:49:29.506 --> 01:49:31.925
Allow me a parting gift.

01:49:33.009 --> 01:49:34.803
But remember this.

01:49:35.512 --> 01:49:38.765
Sooner or later,

01:49:38.849 --> 01:49:42.394
the thirst will always win.

01:50:02.455 --> 01:50:05.417
And I'm back,
and I'm back again
