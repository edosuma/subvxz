28:48.858 --> 28:51.556
Why didn't I notice?

28:51.558 --> 28:54.025
Why didn't I see
that you were ill?

28:57.459 --> 28:59.326
Please, Bill.

29:00.758 --> 29:03.357
Look at me.

29:03.359 --> 29:04.693
Say something.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.723
Don't you think we should
leave them alone for a minute?

29:15.725 --> 29:18.090
What for?

29:18.092 --> 29:20.956
Personal space.

29:20.958 --> 29:23.823
Right now they need us.

29:23.825 --> 29:25.922
They need our attention.

29:25.924 --> 29:27.922
What they need
is our friendship

29:27.924 --> 29:30.323
and some clear thinking.

29:30.325 --> 29:32.490
Burning.
I-I smell burning.

29:32.492 --> 29:34.691
Oh, it's the <i>vol-au-vents.</i>

29:34.693 --> 29:36.723
I'll deal with it.

29:36.725 --> 29:38.457
Isn't Jinny the chef?

29:38.459 --> 29:40.523
A very good one, actually.

29:40.525 --> 29:43.723
Runner-up on <i>MasterChef</i> last year.
Did you watch it?

29:43.725 --> 29:47.757
Two smears of parsnip and a grape <i>coulis.</i>
How could I forget?

29:47.759 --> 29:49.791
So, Jinny, could you?

29:49.793 --> 29:52.456
Ten pounds. You've gained
at least ten pounds, Martha,

29:52.458 --> 29:54.523
since the extremely
touching ceremony.

29:54.525 --> 29:57.459
- Oh. And the matching hats...

don't just sit there.

30:15.392 --> 30:18.056
- TOM: What can I do?
- Help me.

30:18.058 --> 30:21.589
I can't help anyone.
I can't even help myself.

30:21.591 --> 30:23.723
I am burning.

30:23.725 --> 30:25.556
It's the pastry cases
that are burning, Tom.

30:25.558 --> 30:28.456
Could you turn
the light on, please?

30:28.458 --> 30:30.426
(COUGHS)

30:31.992 --> 30:34.690
Do you think...

30:34.692 --> 30:36.457
Yes, my friend?

30:36.459 --> 30:38.756
Do you really think that

30:38.758 --> 30:43.723
a terminal prognosis
is a-a form of curse?

30:43.725 --> 30:45.989
Yes, I do.

30:45.991 --> 30:49.357
You see, I...
I'm a materialist.

30:49.359 --> 30:51.955
And an atheist.

30:51.957 --> 30:54.556
My worldview
has been formed

30:54.558 --> 30:56.790
on reason
and observation,

30:56.792 --> 31:00.357
cause and effect,
logic and deduction.

31:00.359 --> 31:04.390
I've always been
a rationalist, haven't I?

31:04.392 --> 31:06.590
You have, Bill.

31:06.592 --> 31:08.923
And from a statistical
point of view,

31:08.925 --> 31:12.489
as Janet's
very often reminded me,

31:12.491 --> 31:14.922
it is your...

31:14.924 --> 31:18.424
class background
and economic status

31:18.426 --> 31:20.523
that will determine
your general health

31:20.525 --> 31:22.823
and expected lifespan

31:22.825 --> 31:27.424
infinitely more than
diet or exercise.

31:27.426 --> 31:29.691
That's why health is
a political issue.

31:29.693 --> 31:31.823
We've always agreed about that,
haven't we, Bill?

31:31.825 --> 31:34.056
So words like

31:34.058 --> 31:36.822
"curse" and "voodoo"

31:36.824 --> 31:40.656
have never really featured
in my vocabulary.

31:40.658 --> 31:42.758
But now...

31:44.891 --> 31:46.923
everything looks different.

31:46.925 --> 31:49.922
Perhaps everything
<i>is</i> different.

31:49.924 --> 31:52.590
BILL:
Maybe it is.

31:52.592 --> 31:56.424
But the worst of it
is this:

31:56.426 --> 32:01.423
I'm asking myself
an unanswerable question,

32:01.425 --> 32:04.790
even a metaphysical question.

32:04.792 --> 32:08.493
And what question is that,
my friend?

32:12.325 --> 32:14.259
"Why me?"

32:22.092 --> 32:27.523
When a person becomes sick,
there is always a reason.

32:27.525 --> 32:30.324
If not in this life,

32:30.326 --> 32:33.056
then in a past life.

Oh, Gottfried.

You're an embarrassment.

Possibly, but at least
he's trying to help.

32:42.058 --> 32:44.357
Oh, you're defending
Gottfried now?

32:44.359 --> 32:47.324
April, I too
am frequently described

32:47.326 --> 32:51.590
by Internet trolls as
an embarrassment or worse.

32:51.592 --> 32:54.923
Much worse, actually. Is it a
crime to be an embarrassment?

32:54.925 --> 32:58.524
Martha, you're
a first-class lesbian

32:58.526 --> 33:00.790
and a second-rate thinker.

33:00.792 --> 33:02.923
Must be all those
women's studies.

33:02.925 --> 33:05.623
April, really.
I am a professor

33:05.625 --> 33:09.656

gender differentiation

33:09.658 --> 33:11.590
in American Utopianism.

You're really sweaty.
Are you ill too?

33:31.957 --> 33:33.523
I told you, I am burning.

33:33.525 --> 33:35.690
- I have to protect my babies.
- Yes.

33:35.692 --> 33:37.356
You do have
to protect your babies,

33:37.358 --> 33:39.689
like I have to
protect my marriage.

33:39.691 --> 33:41.790
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

33:41.792 --> 33:45.690
You are very fortunate, Jinny. Myself
and Marianne, we have not had any babies.

33:45.692 --> 33:49.723
Neither has anyone at this
party, as far as I know, but...

33:49.725 --> 33:51.990
So you're definitely
not ill, then?

33:51.992 --> 33:55.623
Tell me who is sick.
Okay? Sick!

33:55.625 --> 33:57.990
Then why aren't you
turning that thing off?

doing all right in there?

something out of the...

Let's get to the point.

34:27.591 --> 34:29.589
Listen, Bill,

34:29.591 --> 34:33.655
have they suggested
chopping a few bits out?

34:33.657 --> 34:35.989
Or off?
Because if they have,

34:35.992 --> 34:38.723
I think you should
seriously consider it.

W-What do you say,

Surgery a good choice
for Bill,

34:43.824 --> 34:47.790
yes or no, from
a life-coach standpoint?

34:47.792 --> 34:51.755
Despite my criticism
of most modern medicine,

34:51.757 --> 34:55.688
I believe surgery
can sometimes be...

34:55.690 --> 34:59.324
healing, April, as you know.

34:59.326 --> 35:02.623
Karmically cleansing.

really queasy again.

line of thought heading, chum?

36:24.058 --> 36:27.855
Well, maybe Gottfried
has a point.

36:27.857 --> 36:31.323
What once seemed like medical
science now looks like superstition,

36:31.325 --> 36:33.588
does it not, Martha?
I mean...

36:33.590 --> 36:37.790
And then there's the mystery
of the placebo effect.

36:37.792 --> 36:40.622
The so-called mystery
of the placebo effect

36:40.624 --> 36:43.623
is in fact proof
of the innate ability

36:43.625 --> 36:45.889
of the body
to heal itself.

with your analysis.

36:54.325 --> 36:56.325

...can f-faith do it?

Why not?

extraordinarily fast,

37:14.024 --> 37:16.556
from a spiritual
point of view.

37:16.558 --> 37:19.422
Concerning spirituality,
Bill has debated with

37:19.424 --> 37:22.689
leading rabbis, bishops
and Imams, and he's won.

37:22.691 --> 37:24.890
He's even written
a book about it:

37:24.892 --> 37:27.588
<i>Reason, Roads, and Religion.</i>

37:27.590 --> 37:30.723
Is there a connection, Martha,
between roads and religion?

37:30.725 --> 37:33.789
Bill specialized in Roman
history, as I think you know.

37:33.791 --> 37:37.422
Didn't he supervise
Marianne's PhD?

37:37.424 --> 37:40.588
Yes, he did. He did supervise her PhD.
Yes, her fucking PhD.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.955
And roads link more than cities.
They also link ideas.

37:42.957 --> 37:46.057
Well, thank you, Martha. Thank you for
illuminating me on the question of roads.

37:46.059 --> 37:48.455
Please!
The only one road

37:48.457 --> 37:50.822
that matters now is the road
to Bill's recovery.

37:50.824 --> 37:54.389
- BILL: Do you believe in recovery, Gottfried?
- I do.

37:54.391 --> 37:56.488
Even in a case like mine?

37:56.490 --> 37:57.926
I do.

37:59.491 --> 38:01.355
So you think
I have a future?

38:01.357 --> 38:03.422
As surely
as you had a past.

38:03.424 --> 38:05.423
Isn't this
going too far?

but is not, repeat not, a guru.

Listen, my friend.

38:34.992 --> 38:37.690

38:37.692 --> 38:40.859
You just have to listen
to your voice within.

If you seek,
you will find.

Right. And since
we're talking about truth,

something you might want to add?

I'm talking about, Bill.

any of you have heard of?

- No, Martha. No, please.
