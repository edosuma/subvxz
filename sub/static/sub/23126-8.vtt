WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:02.719
- Previously on Being Human.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.592
- Maybe you're not trying to move on.
- I'm lonely.

00:05.630 --> 00:09.134
- I know you're nothing.
You're dead.

00:09.170 --> 00:14.973
- If you haunt me or Danny,
I won't acknowledge you.

00:15.010 --> 00:17.377
- I'm in this
rehabilitation program,

00:17.410 --> 00:19.572
trying to prove
to Nora Sorgent

00:19.620 --> 00:21.679
that I'm an upstanding
member of society

00:21.720 --> 00:24.212
and not a raging ass-hat.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.252
Mail call.

00:26.290 --> 00:27.416
Hello, sexy!

00:27.460 --> 00:29.189
- They sent you that DVD

00:29.230 --> 00:31.085
because they think
I affect you.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.756
- Oh my god!
What is she doing?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.768
- Whoa!
- Make it stop!

00:36.800 --> 00:37.961
Is that what vampires do?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.399
- They get off on this,
don't they?

00:39.440 --> 00:42.239
- Someone's just messing
with me. I will get rid of it.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.438
(Car honking)

00:46.480 --> 00:49.575
- (Sally): One of mankind's
greatest abilities

00:49.610 --> 00:51.248
is the power to lie.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.113
Whether it's for good or bad,
profit or survival,

00:54.150 --> 00:56.380
we bend the truth.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.788
It's a skill we pick up early
and hone over time,

00:59.820 --> 01:02.528
pulling the wool over
the eyes of our parents,

01:02.560 --> 01:04.153
our teachers, our boss,

01:04.190 --> 01:05.521
even ourselves.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.928
We tell ourselves
we'll lose weight,

01:08.960 --> 01:10.268
quit smoking,

01:10.300 --> 01:12.291
that, at the end of the day,

01:12.340 --> 01:13.660
we're really a good person.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.963
(Knocking)

01:15.000 --> 01:15.990
- (Josh): Aidan!

01:18.810 --> 01:19.936
(Knocking)

01:19.980 --> 01:21.004
Aidan!

01:22.080 --> 01:24.606
- What's up?
- You OK?

01:24.650 --> 01:26.778
- Yeah, I was just
watching something.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.415
- Good, 'cause Sally's demanding
we take her to the bar.

01:30.450 --> 01:31.940
- She can't drink.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.412
- So what if I can't drink?

01:33.460 --> 01:35.519
Hanging out at a bar
isn't about drinking.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.789
It's about hanging,

01:36.830 --> 01:38.821
spending quality time
with my buddies.

01:38.860 --> 01:42.319
- Sally, you're a great buddy,
but you're dead.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.520
- Just because I'm dead doesn't
mean I can't have a life.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.993
- You had a life. You need
to continue your journey.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.737
- Oh God! I love how
you say journey,

01:49.770 --> 01:52.637
like I've hopped on some
fantastical winged stead

01:52.680 --> 01:54.432
and I'm soaring through
a cloudy land of adventure.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.778
And it's not like
I didn't try, OK?

01:56.810 --> 01:59.871
I went on my journey and
I got my ass handed to me,

01:59.920 --> 02:00.978
like Danny.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.385
Now you two are all I have.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.514
- Josh, back me up here.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.682
(Inaudible)

02:07.720 --> 02:09.050
- Isn't that your, um...

02:10.229 --> 02:12.358
What is she exactly?
- My Nora.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.721
I mean,
her name is Nora.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.898
(Clears throat)

02:15.930 --> 02:17.261
- Who's that guy she's with?

02:17.300 --> 02:20.361
- Travis Reid.
He's a doctor at S.E.H.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.834
- Why don't you
go over there and say hi?

02:21.870 --> 02:23.031
- No, I'm--

02:23.070 --> 02:25.334
I don't want to interrupt them.
I mean, it...

02:25.370 --> 02:26.838
looks like a date.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.439
- Looks like
an after-work drink.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.141
Probably just
talking shop.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.250
- Ah!

02:31.280 --> 02:33.044
(Clears throat)

02:34.720 --> 02:36.074
What are you doing?

02:36.120 --> 02:38.043
- I'm gonna creep up there
ninja-style and have a listen.

02:38.090 --> 02:40.912
You're always throwing it
in my face that I'm a ghost.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.122
Let's put it to use.
- Wait!

02:44.590 --> 02:46.524
- Do you have any idea
how difficult

02:46.560 --> 02:47.959
you make it for
me to work?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.149
- (Nora): Is that so?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.599
- I'm trying to focus,

02:50.630 --> 02:53.338
do my job and I'm constantly
distracted by you.

02:53.370 --> 02:54.895
You're simply
too attractive.

02:54.940 --> 02:57.500
It's gonna cost someone's life
one of these days.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.406
(Nora screams)

02:59.440 --> 03:00.874
What the hell?
- Oh my god!

03:00.910 --> 03:02.503
- That was no after-work drink.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.779
You get in there, pronto.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.369
- Can we get a towel
or something?

03:05.410 --> 03:06.741
- I'm not gonna
go over there

03:06.780 --> 03:09.249
while she's picking
glass off his lap.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.883
- The deck is stacked
against you.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.059
He's a doctor.
He's smart, rich, good-looking.

03:13.090 --> 03:15.650
He's got great hair and
a chin dimple, and you're...

03:15.690 --> 03:18.455
- Well, uh, you are Josh
and you are very smart

03:18.490 --> 03:19.889
and, uh... funny.

03:19.930 --> 03:22.820
- And you look super-cute
in that sweater vest.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.293
- Yes.
- I do?

03:25.330 --> 03:27.731
- Yes! You're rocking it.
Get in there.

03:29.870 --> 03:32.601
(* Man singing rock ballad
on stereo *)

03:35.210 --> 03:37.702
What happens when
we call our own bluff,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.718
when we can't
convince ourselves

03:39.750 --> 03:43.414
that deep down, we really
aren't the stuff of nightmares?

04:03.070 --> 04:04.708
(Honking)

04:04.740 --> 04:06.378
(Siren)

04:06.410 --> 04:08.538
(Telephone ringing)

04:12.850 --> 04:14.545
- (Man): Dr. Miller?

04:14.580 --> 04:17.379
- You know, I've been
thinking about last night

04:17.420 --> 04:20.014
and you were right
not to make a move.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.016
- Really?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.380
- No! Look at them!

04:22.430 --> 04:26.025
Josh, you can't let Nora
go out with that bastard.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.392
- Maybe she's into bastards.
I don't know.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.626
As long as
she's happy, right?

04:30.670 --> 04:32.889
- Aw! You really are
a janitor, aren't you?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.568
(Clears throat)

04:35.600 --> 04:37.864
- I'm an orderly.
- Still kind of sad.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.400
- What are you
doing here?

04:39.440 --> 04:40.908
- I just thought I'd come by,

04:40.940 --> 04:42.806
see what my homeboys
are up to, hang.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.170
- We're working.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.769
- Doesn't mean I can't--

04:45.810 --> 04:49.110
Dear God! That man looks
even better in scrubs.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.788
- Would you guys
please just leave me

04:50.820 --> 04:54.654
to mop up whatever
this is in peace, please?

04:54.690 --> 04:57.819
- Well, I'm done and, actually,
I'm glad you're here, Sally,

04:57.860 --> 05:00.625
because I wanna
show you something.

05:00.660 --> 05:03.300
(Woman on PA, indistinct)

05:10.640 --> 05:12.779
This is the
original hospital.

05:12.810 --> 05:15.529
It was built in 1878,
closed down in '89.

05:15.580 --> 05:19.539
It was Boston's pre-eminent
tuberculosis treatment facility

05:19.580 --> 05:21.378
at the turn
of the century.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.888
Ah, yes.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.183
- I'm bored.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.780
Can I go back and
watch Josh mop up urine?

05:26.820 --> 05:30.120
- The point is that many people
don't come to the old wing

05:30.160 --> 05:32.458
because many people
claim it's haunted.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.626
- Is it?

05:34.660 --> 05:36.469
- Extremely.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.731
But you'll have to
see that for yourself.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.239
- Hold up. I'm not
going in there alone.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.009
Come with me.
- Can't.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.745
- If you think
I'm going into a place

05:58.790 --> 06:00.212
that scares a member
of the undead,

06:00.260 --> 06:01.216
you flipped
your pancake.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.819
- I'm not scared.
It's just--

06:04.430 --> 06:07.491
Some of the ghosts
that wander those halls,

06:07.530 --> 06:08.998
I put them there.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.624
- And why in the world
would I go in there by myself?

06:11.670 --> 06:16.699
- Because, Josh and I
can only help you so far.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.663
There may be
answers in there.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.472
- Well, wait. What if
they hate me in there,

06:22.510 --> 06:23.978
you know, like
they hate you?

06:24.010 --> 06:25.171
- You'll be fine.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.165
(Sighing)

06:51.210 --> 06:53.702
- I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going.

07:05.850 --> 07:08.182
Holy creepies.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.779
(Woman shouting
in distance, indistinct)

07:37.590 --> 07:40.309
(Sally breathing unevenly)

07:47.730 --> 07:48.856
- Have you seen her?

07:48.900 --> 07:50.425
(Gasps)

07:50.470 --> 07:54.361
Have you seen
my Constance?

07:54.400 --> 07:56.607
She said she
wouldn't be long.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.700
Have you seen her?

07:59.740 --> 08:00.707
- No, I--

08:00.740 --> 08:03.050
- Leave her alone, Nathan.

08:04.710 --> 08:08.772
Man's been lookin' for Constance
goin' on 40 years now.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.811
I don't think he gets it.

08:12.390 --> 08:13.858
My name's Barbara,
by the way.

08:13.890 --> 08:14.789
(Exhaling sharply)

08:14.820 --> 08:16.629
- What is all this?

08:16.660 --> 08:20.028
- This is where people like us
come to search for things:

08:20.060 --> 08:22.324
loved ones who've passed,

08:22.360 --> 08:25.295
those still on their way.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.638
How about you?

08:28.900 --> 08:30.459
What are you
looking for?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.239
(Woman whispering, indistinct)

08:32.270 --> 08:33.977
- I--I don't know.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.674
A way out.

08:36.710 --> 08:39.441
- That's the most popular
question on these walls.

08:43.419 --> 08:45.286
- Has it worked
for anyone?

08:45.320 --> 08:48.551
- The answer for that question
is different for each one of us.

08:48.590 --> 08:50.627
(Sighing)

08:50.660 --> 08:52.287
- So it's a shot
in the dark.

08:52.330 --> 08:56.528
- Sometimes it helps just
to, uh, announce you're here.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.793
(Many voices
whispering, indistinct)

08:59.840 --> 09:01.239
- You must've seen her.

09:01.270 --> 09:03.409
You were out there
with the living.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.070
- You know, I need
to get a message out.

09:07.110 --> 09:09.602
- OK, but I can't--

09:09.650 --> 09:11.106
- It was Sabatino
and his guys.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.709
They're the only ones that knew.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.640
- Ah, don't worry, honey.
They can't hurt ya.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.284
No one can.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.451
You're one of us now.

09:20.490 --> 09:21.889
(Chuckling)

09:21.920 --> 09:24.082
- No! I'm not one of you!

09:24.130 --> 09:26.383
(Barbara continues chuckling)

09:28.600 --> 09:30.898
(Panting)

09:36.070 --> 09:38.061
(Birds chirping)

09:40.010 --> 09:42.536
- (Boy 1): Where do you think
you're going?

09:42.580 --> 09:43.547
Give me your bag!

09:43.580 --> 09:45.048
- (Boy 2):
Give that back!

09:45.080 --> 09:46.809
- You little twerp.
- Stop it!

09:46.850 --> 09:48.716
- No, make me.
- Leave me alone!

09:48.750 --> 09:50.741
(Boy 1 laughing)

09:50.790 --> 09:52.610
- Come on, loser!
You gotta catch it.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.082
What's he got
in here, anyways?

09:54.120 --> 09:56.987
- Hey! That's enough.
Leave him alone.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.124
- Why don't you
mind your own business?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.628
- What?

10:00.660 --> 10:02.059
- Get out of
here, creeper.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.762
- Uh, how about a little
respect for your elders?

10:04.800 --> 10:08.100
- What you gonna do? Hit me
and my dad will own your ass.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.630
(Sniffs)

10:11.370 --> 10:13.930
- OK, wait. Which one of
you wets the bed?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.732
It's you, isn't it?

10:15.780 --> 10:18.044
- I don't wet my bed.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.276
- Uh, yeah, you do.
You reek of it.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.743
I'll bet you wake up early every
morning at the crack of dawn

10:22.790 --> 10:25.213
scrubbing the sheets
until the sun comes up,

10:25.250 --> 10:29.084
but you just can't
wash it all away, can you?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.087
(Scoffing)

10:30.130 --> 10:31.222
- Let's go.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.921
- Dude, you really
pee your bed?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.450
- Shut up!

10:36.500 --> 10:37.524
- Are you OK?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.129
- Yeah, thanks.

10:39.170 --> 10:42.470
Normally I can get away,
but I forgot my keys.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.535
- What's your name?

10:46.570 --> 10:48.277
- My name's Bernie.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.971
I'm a neighbour.

10:50.010 --> 10:51.546
- Nobody's home, huh?

10:51.580 --> 10:52.945
- My mom's at work.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.610
Do you think it'd be OK
if I wait for her at your house?

10:58.850 --> 11:01.512
- Uh, I don't think
that that would be a...

11:01.560 --> 11:05.485
- OK, well, I guess
I can wait here.

11:05.530 --> 11:08.420
Maybe they won't come back.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.868
- OK, come on.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.800
- Hey!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.900
Where have
you been hiding?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.600
- Me? No hide.
I mean, I don't--

11:24.650 --> 11:25.606
(Chuckles)

11:25.650 --> 11:26.913
I have no
reason to hide.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.816
- We haven't talked
since everything

11:28.850 --> 11:30.818
went down with
your sister. Is she OK?

11:30.850 --> 11:32.181
- Emily, yeah.
She's fine.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.882
I got her cleaned up,
took her home, saw my folks.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.183
It was great.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.621
How 'bout you?
How have you been?

11:38.660 --> 11:43.268
Um, I, uh, I saw you
with Dr. Reid

11:43.300 --> 11:44.665
at the b-bar.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.829
You two looked
very close.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.599
Friendly.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.029
- Wow, stalk much?

11:52.070 --> 11:53.003
- No, not much.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.371
I mean, I don't stalk you

11:54.410 --> 11:55.832
or anyone, really,
for that matter,

11:55.880 --> 11:57.041
because I'm not
a stalker.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.618
I happened to be there and
you happened to be there, so...

12:00.650 --> 12:02.277
- Why didn't
you come over?

12:02.320 --> 12:04.687
- I didn't wanna
crash your date.

12:06.590 --> 12:08.957
Was it--
Was it that?

12:10.990 --> 12:13.527
A date, I mean.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.598
- I do love to
watch you squirm.

12:16.630 --> 12:18.359
It's as though
you're an artist

12:18.400 --> 12:19.890
and awkward is
your medium.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.398
- If you and Reid are
having a thing, I get it.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.070
OK? But I'd really like
to get together again,

12:26.110 --> 12:28.602
maybe have a--a--a date
that doesn't end with us

12:28.640 --> 12:30.199
tending to my
battered sister.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.948
- What about
tonight, 8:007?

12:33.980 --> 12:35.744
I'll cook for
you this time.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.612
- Tonight?
Like, tonight, tonight?

12:37.650 --> 12:39.709
- I have a week of
night shifts coming up.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.650
What do you say?

12:41.690 --> 12:43.624
- Is Dr. Reid
OK with it?

12:43.660 --> 12:44.627
(Chuckles)

12:44.660 --> 12:46.185
- It was an
after-work drink

12:46.230 --> 12:47.595
that could have
turned into a date.

12:47.630 --> 12:48.859
- Ah.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.291
- But you missed the end where
his beer exploded onto his lap.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.434
- Oh no, I saw that.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.598
- It was strange.
Beyond strange, actually.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.233
How do you feel
about lamb chops?

12:57.270 --> 12:59.102
I'm kind of amazing
with lamb chops...

12:59.140 --> 13:00.278
- Are you
in on this?

13:00.310 --> 13:01.539
Do you have
any idea

13:01.580 --> 13:03.400
about the freak show
going on in this hospital?

13:03.450 --> 13:04.906
- No, not now.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.042
- Not now?

13:07.050 --> 13:08.017
- No!

13:08.050 --> 13:09.415
- Yes, now.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.339
- I mean, I--I used to
like lamb chops,

13:11.390 --> 13:12.789
but--but--but not now,

13:12.820 --> 13:14.515
because I got sick
from them once.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.949
Diarrhoea.
- Oh!

13:16.990 --> 13:18.082
- Really?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.689
- Yeah, so...
But I'd love to

13:19.730 --> 13:21.152
give them another shot.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.226
(Both talking
simultaneously)

13:27.500 --> 13:29.229
- So 8:00 is good?

13:29.270 --> 13:30.635
- 8:00 is awesome.

13:30.670 --> 13:32.263
- Great.
- You don't even care!

13:32.310 --> 13:33.800
- So, it's a date.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.730
- Oh my god!
- Why would Aiden do that to me?

13:36.780 --> 13:38.270
- What the hell was that?

13:38.310 --> 13:39.300
- I don't know.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.478
- OK, I've gotta--

13:41.520 --> 13:43.147
I've gotta go
finish up some stuff.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.079
I'll see you tonight?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.384
- Yeah, I'll see
you tonight.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.459
- So what time is
your mom coming home?

13:55.500 --> 13:57.298
- 6:30.

13:57.330 --> 13:58.820
Got any 10s?

13:58.870 --> 14:00.690
- Go fish.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.390
- This is fun.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.862
(Chuckling)

14:03.910 --> 14:05.435
Really? Go Fish?

14:05.470 --> 14:08.337
Bernie, your fun bar
is set a little low.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.248
- Normally, I'd just be watching
TV or doing my homework.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.748
- Got any
favourite subjects?

14:13.780 --> 14:16.715
- History. I'm doing
a project on Paul Revere.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.081
- Oh, what a tool.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.350
- Who? Paul Revere?

14:20.390 --> 14:22.119
How would you know?

14:24.390 --> 14:26.028
- Hello!

14:26.060 --> 14:27.789
It was an
after-work drink!

14:27.830 --> 14:29.252
- You blood-sucking turd!

14:29.300 --> 14:31.098
- We're going out tonight!

14:32.300 --> 14:34.940
Hello there, little friend.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.131
- Oh, thi--

14:36.170 --> 14:38.867
Um, this is Bernie
from across the street.

14:38.910 --> 14:40.378
Bernie, this is Josh.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.902
He's hanging out until
his mom comes to get him.

14:42.950 --> 14:46.341
- I was getting bullied.
- Oh! Beat up?

14:46.380 --> 14:49.645
- Back-pack keep-away.
- See, that's...

14:49.680 --> 14:51.284
- You're lucky
I can't touch stuff

14:51.320 --> 14:53.584
or else I'd take
a piece of wood,

14:53.620 --> 14:56.487
I'd sharpen it into a stake
and shove it straight up your--

14:56.520 --> 14:57.954
- So, Bern, you hungry?

14:57.990 --> 14:59.185
- I could eat.

14:59.230 --> 15:00.789
- Good.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.389
Um, I'll make you
a sandwich.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.693
(Whooshing)

15:03.730 --> 15:05.619
- What in the hell
were you thinking?

15:05.670 --> 15:07.229
- I was thinking
maybe you could

15:07.270 --> 15:10.205
connect with your
own kind, make a friend.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.537
- A friend?
A friend. Who?

15:11.570 --> 15:13.299
One of those things
in that hallway?

15:13.340 --> 15:15.672
- They're not things.
They're spirits like you.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.075
- Not like that, I'm not.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.340
- Well, not yet.
Right now, you're OK.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.518
But if you stick around,

15:20.550 --> 15:21.676
you let things
remain unresolved,

15:21.720 --> 15:23.449
sooner or later,
it will be too late.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.050
You will end up just like
those people you saw today,

15:26.090 --> 15:27.353
searching for
the pieces of a puzzle

15:27.390 --> 15:29.358
that doesn't even
exist anymore.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.354
- What are you playing?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.459
- Go Fish.
He likes it.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.492
- That is so adorable, I can't
even be mad at you right now.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.669
Are you telling me
you're a kid person?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.239
- Hi, I'm Cindy Landon,
Bernie's mom.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.247
- Aidan. Hi.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.078
Here he is.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.444
- Bernie, what were
you thinking,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.083
coming over to
a stranger's house?

16:00.120 --> 16:03.158
- He's a neighbour, and I called
before I came over.

16:03.190 --> 16:05.227
- Oh, you called.
He could've murdered you

16:05.260 --> 16:07.149
between the phone
and the door.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.349
- Mom...
- No offense.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.993
I mean, you never know

16:10.030 --> 16:11.725
who's living
across the street.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.864
- Aiden saved me from
getting my ass stomped again.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.459
- Language!
- I'm sorry.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.229
There's no other
way to describe it.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.409
- I was happy to do it.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.670
- Thank you. If I can
ever return the favour.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.145
- Oh, I promise to
call you if anyone picks on me.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.171
Bernie!

16:29.180 --> 16:29.920
(Laughing)

16:29.950 --> 16:31.645
See you later.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.316
- Did you double-down
on antiperspirant?

16:36.360 --> 16:37.725
You sweat a lot
when you're nervous.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.489
- I went through half
a Speed Stick.

16:39.530 --> 16:40.691
- How's your breath?

16:40.730 --> 16:41.891
(Exhaling)

16:41.930 --> 16:44.297
I don't have a sense
of smell anymore.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.059
(Exhaling)

16:46.100 --> 16:47.192
(Sniffing)

16:47.240 --> 16:50.130
- I gotta be honest,
it smells like dog to me.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.569
But I'm sure
it's minty fresh.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.408
- I should just
postpone this thing.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.407
- Well, why?

16:54.440 --> 16:55.737
- I'm turning tomorrow.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.929
- So?

16:56.980 --> 17:00.439
- So, he's saying he--
You feel wolfy, right?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.619
- OK, I don't know what
"feeling wolfy" means,

17:02.650 --> 17:05.415
but I do know that you haven't
gotten laid in 2 years.

17:05.450 --> 17:08.056
Josh, be the wolf!

17:08.089 --> 17:09.717
Huh?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.887
- Be the wolf.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.250
- Be the wolf.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.098
** T've been a castaway... **

17:16.130 --> 17:18.827
- And the jerk just kept
throwing magazines at me!

17:18.869 --> 17:20.019
(Josh chuckling)

17:20.069 --> 17:21.094
- So, what did you do?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.493
- I threw every
magazine back at him...

17:22.540 --> 17:23.530
(Laughing)

17:23.569 --> 17:25.003
...told him I didn't care
if he was the archbishop.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.439
I'd kick him out
of my waiting room.

17:26.470 --> 17:29.735
- Nice. SO my nominee
for worst patient ever

17:29.780 --> 17:30.872
is Mr. Fisicos.

17:30.910 --> 17:33.470
I think he might
be the meanest dia--

17:33.520 --> 17:36.217
No, the meanest person

17:36.250 --> 17:38.412
I have literally
ever met in my life.

17:38.450 --> 17:40.043
- Yeah.

17:40.090 --> 17:42.787
They amputated
both his legs today.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.180
- Oh.

17:49.830 --> 17:52.367
It was great lasa--
Great lasagne.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.367
(Chuckles)

17:53.400 --> 17:54.367
Just great.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.538
(Clears throat)

17:55.570 --> 17:57.299
- This part sucks,
doesn't it?

17:57.340 --> 17:58.933
- What part?

17:58.970 --> 18:02.179
- The part where we sit here
and talk in circles,

18:02.210 --> 18:05.043
- when all we want to do
is move on to the good stuff,

18:05.080 --> 18:07.117
the kissing and
the groping.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.117
- Yeah...

18:08.150 --> 18:09.117
(Chuckles)

18:09.150 --> 18:12.040
I was kind of waiting
for my opening, you know?

18:12.090 --> 18:13.979
Just, like, a signal
or something.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.317
- Hmm, like the tour.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.022
Yeah, when a woman wants
to show you her apartment,

18:18.060 --> 18:20.995
it's usually just an excuse
to get you in the bedroom.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.928
Come on! No one's ever
offered you the tour?

18:24.970 --> 18:26.597
- I'm afraid not.

18:29.170 --> 18:30.638
- Josh...

18:32.470 --> 18:36.077
Would you like to see
the rest of my apartment?

18:36.110 --> 18:37.373
(Giggles)

18:37.410 --> 18:39.401
- No. Nope!

18:39.450 --> 18:41.043
(Chuckling)

18:41.080 --> 18:43.515
Mmm!

18:43.550 --> 18:45.712
- You have really
soft lips.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.616
- I'm a big
lip balm guy.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.980
(Giggling)

18:51.760 --> 18:54.092
(Panting)

18:54.130 --> 18:55.655
(Growling)

18:58.970 --> 19:00.233
(Growling)

19:00.270 --> 19:01.431
Oh my god!

19:01.470 --> 19:03.609
- What, what, what?
What's the matter?

19:03.640 --> 19:04.766
- Nothing.
Uh, nothing.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.335
No, it's--it's--

19:06.370 --> 19:07.906
I just, uh,
I can't.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.079
- Why, why, why?
Did I do something?

19:10.110 --> 19:11.646
- No. God, no.
You're perfect.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.671
No, it's me.
It's my--it's my problem.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.245
- Well, what?
What is it then?

19:15.280 --> 19:18.443
I'm a nurse. I promise this is
nothing I haven't seen before.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.015
- I just-- I have--

19:20.050 --> 19:23.429
I have a problem,
uh, controlling myself.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.054
- You and about
30 billion other guys.

19:26.090 --> 19:27.899
That's--that's not
that big a deal.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.420
Come on,
we'll take it slow.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.122
- No, no. I--I--I really, um,
I really should--

19:32.170 --> 19:33.592
I--I'm sorry.
I should go.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.893
- This was love--
This was a lovely evening.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.910
I, um... I--T'll call
you tomorrow, OK?

19:38.940 --> 19:40.601
(Door closing)

19:40.640 --> 19:42.404
(Sighing)

19:52.450 --> 19:53.713
- Hey, Aidan!

19:53.760 --> 19:54.909
- Hey! What's up?

19:54.960 --> 19:55.916
- Not much.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.282
So you wanna kick
a ball around or something?

19:59.330 --> 20:02.755
- Uh, Bernie, I'm, like,
200 years older than you.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.926
- I don't care.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.436
- They always there?

20:09.470 --> 20:11.404
- Pretty much.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.862
- You know what?
Let's do it.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.605
- Really?
- Ah, yeah.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.247
- Hey, Mom, is it cool
if I go to the park with Aidan?

20:18.280 --> 20:20.419
- I'm sure Aidan's busy.

20:20.450 --> 20:22.418
- Actually,
I'm incredibly un-busy.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.384
- Please?

20:24.420 --> 20:26.309
- Get your jacket.

20:32.860 --> 20:35.830
Are you trying to
use my son to pick up girls?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.828
"Cause that only
works with babies.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.690
- No, puppies
are good too.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.562
(Chuckling)

20:41.600 --> 20:43.659
Guess there's--
there's no guidebook

20:43.710 --> 20:45.701
for how to handle
this, is there?

20:45.740 --> 20:47.469
- What do you mean?

20:48.510 --> 20:49.875
- Letting him go,

20:49.910 --> 20:51.708
be a normal kid
and all that.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.843
You seem like
a good guy, Aidan,

20:54.880 --> 20:57.440
and I really appreciate
what you did for Bernie,

20:57.490 --> 21:01.415
but I hardly know you,
and if anything ever happens--

21:01.460 --> 21:03.485
- Well, then you know
where I live.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.420
I promise I will
watch out for him.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.495
(Dog barking)

21:16.640 --> 21:18.631
- OK.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.604
Have fun.

21:23.810 --> 21:25.869
Be careful!

21:39.030 --> 21:41.522
- Why are you vacuuming
like a crazy person?

21:41.560 --> 21:43.528
- What?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.163
It's all good.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.170
- Do you want to
talk about it?

21:48.200 --> 21:50.032
(Chuckles nervously)

22:05.290 --> 22:06.689
- I growled.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.210
- What?

22:08.260 --> 22:10.388
- Nora and I, we--we were...

22:12.130 --> 22:14.189
being together, and I...

22:14.230 --> 22:15.652
(Sighing)

22:15.700 --> 22:16.997
...growled.

22:17.030 --> 22:20.022
- Like, you were trying
to be sexy?

22:20.070 --> 22:21.265
- No.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.668
- Well, did she mind?

22:24.710 --> 22:26.360
- She didn't notice.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.777
- Oh. So what's the problem?

22:28.810 --> 22:29.800
(Whooshing)

22:29.840 --> 22:31.239
- I lost control.

22:35.750 --> 22:40.688
I knew I had no business being
around anybody, especially Nora,

22:40.720 --> 22:42.188
but I went anyway.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.257
- Because you like Nora,
and she likes you,

22:44.290 --> 22:46.258
and you deserved
to go on a date.

22:46.290 --> 22:49.624
- She doesn't deserve
to have me, what I am,

22:49.660 --> 22:52.061
inflicted on her.

22:54.670 --> 22:58.129
She deserves a guy
like Dr. Reid.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.808
(Sighing)

22:59.840 --> 23:01.171
- What you are?

23:02.610 --> 23:04.476
What you are is alive.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.650
Yeah, one night
every 4 weeks

23:08.680 --> 23:10.170
you turn into a wolf.

23:10.220 --> 23:14.259
But every other day,
you get to have a job,

23:15.560 --> 23:19.588
you get to go on dates,
fall in love.

23:21.830 --> 23:24.060
I'd kill to have
your life, Josh.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.969
I'd kill to
have any life.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.160
- I gotta be honest
with you, Bernie.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.352
It's a little strange
that you're out here,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.550
when you could be
locked in your room

23:56.600 --> 23:58.329
playing mindless
video games.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.895
- I like soccer.

23:59.930 --> 24:02.729
- Oh yeah? Huh!

24:02.770 --> 24:05.068
Well, if fresh air's
your thing,

24:05.110 --> 24:06.669
what else do you like?

24:06.710 --> 24:08.200
- I like boats.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.503
My dad had one.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.144
- Really?

24:11.180 --> 24:13.205
Did you ever
go out on it?

24:13.250 --> 24:14.809
- Once.

24:14.850 --> 24:17.490
I don't really remember
a whole lot about him, though,

24:17.520 --> 24:19.113
but I just remember that boat.

24:19.150 --> 24:20.185
I liked it.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.688
- What did you want to be
when you grew up?

24:21.720 --> 24:24.951
- I wanted to take over
my dad's printing press,

24:24.990 --> 24:27.288
but then the, uh,
the war came,

24:27.330 --> 24:28.695
so I joined the army.

24:28.730 --> 24:31.267
- Did you get to do bad-ass
stuff like shoot a gun?

24:31.300 --> 24:32.893
Did you kill somebody?

24:32.930 --> 24:36.491
- There's nothing good
about war, Bernie.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.429
Trust me on this.

24:38.470 --> 24:39.699
- Oh.

24:39.740 --> 24:42.437
Did you take over your dad's
printing press or whatever

24:42.480 --> 24:43.436
when you got back?

24:43.480 --> 24:46.541
- No. Things had changed.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.139
- Ow!

24:48.180 --> 24:50.888
(Bernie groaning)

24:50.920 --> 24:51.887
- You all right?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.217
- Think so.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.179
Yeah, just a scrape.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.221
See?

24:58.260 --> 24:59.921
- Yeah, it's OK.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.292
- Come on, Aidan.
Don't be a wuss.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.909
- Yeah, it's just a scrape.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.739
- Can I play?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.079
- Could you give me a minute?

25:31.690 --> 25:33.658
- What's with
the midget?

25:33.700 --> 25:36.089
- He's just a neighbourhood kid.
What are you doing here?

25:36.130 --> 25:37.325
- I wanted to see you.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.192
We left things a little
abruptly, didn't we?

25:39.230 --> 25:40.322
Or you did.

25:40.370 --> 25:44.204
Look, I get that you're
trying to be careful, I guess.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.505
But I was being honest
with you that night

25:47.540 --> 25:50.430
and I thought we were on
our way to being normal.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.175
- Normal?

25:53.450 --> 25:55.919
Yeah. Yeah, it was
a completely normal evening

25:55.950 --> 25:58.385
right up until Marcus
attacked Josh's sister.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.444
- He did what?

25:59.490 --> 26:00.446
- Oh!

26:00.490 --> 26:02.879
- Aiden, I swear I have no idea

26:02.920 --> 26:04.251
what you're talking about.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.928
- Yeah, because
you're so innocent.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.086
- On this, I am.

26:08.330 --> 26:09.729
Please believe me.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.178
(Sighing)

26:21.210 --> 26:22.939
- Now is not the time.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.846
- I miss you.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.315
I'm lonely.
Aren't you?

26:28.350 --> 26:31.183
Haven't you been
thinking about me?

26:32.420 --> 26:35.014
(Panting)

26:36.060 --> 26:37.755
- You may have
crossed my mind.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.758
(Sighing)

26:45.100 --> 26:46.590
I should go.

26:48.970 --> 26:50.495
(Sighing)

26:59.850 --> 27:02.012
- I've been
watching you with him.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.919
You must've been
a father once.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.384
Probably a great one, right?

27:17.600 --> 27:19.364
(Siren in distance)

27:26.140 --> 27:27.835
- We need to talk.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.836
- I was just--

27:28.880 --> 27:29.972
- Now.

27:30.010 --> 27:31.546
- -1I--I have a
tiny bit of time.

27:31.580 --> 27:32.570
I don't have--

27:37.550 --> 27:38.949
- You're embarrassed.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.118
- I'm a lot of things.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.480
- You are.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.729
You're smart and sexy,

27:45.760 --> 27:47.285
adorable.

27:47.330 --> 27:49.924
- Nora, you don't
have to do this.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.998
- I know I don't have to.
I want to.

27:53.030 --> 27:55.738
And when I want something,
I'm patient.

27:56.770 --> 27:59.501
It's nothing to be
ashamed about.

27:59.540 --> 28:03.841
We don't have to rush
right into... things.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.599
There's plenty of stuff
we can do to lead us there.

28:06.650 --> 28:08.641
(Gasps, clears throat)

28:11.120 --> 28:12.087
(Sighing)

28:12.120 --> 28:13.440
Are you
attracted to me?

28:13.490 --> 28:15.015
- Oh my god, yes.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.657
You're--you're beautiful.

28:20.430 --> 28:22.524
Your eyes,
your touch.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.899
The smell of you.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.159
- Then give me a chance--

28:31.240 --> 28:32.833
(Both moaning)

28:36.610 --> 28:39.648
** 1 |eft the TV on *

28:40.880 --> 28:43.850
* And lit a cigarette *

28:45.020 --> 28:48.058
* T left the words to you *

28:48.090 --> 28:50.013
(Growling)

28:50.060 --> 28:52.279
* The things that I would let *

28:52.330 --> 28:53.889
(Panting)

28:53.930 --> 28:57.355
* You get away with things *

28:57.400 --> 29:00.062
* And I stay up all night *

29:00.100 --> 29:02.899
(Growling)

29:02.940 --> 29:05.159
<i>* I don't wanna hear you *</i>

29:05.210 --> 29:06.837
* Hear you speak... **

29:06.870 --> 29:08.429
(Moaning)

29:09.680 --> 29:11.375
(Growling)

29:16.220 --> 29:18.848
>K

29:18.890 --> 29:21.609
- That's a little film
called Evan Almighty.

29:21.660 --> 29:24.379
- And that's your
favourite movie?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.159
- I've seen it 11 times.

29:26.190 --> 29:28.727
So, what do you think?

29:28.760 --> 29:31.127
- Do you want me to be honest?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.228
- Yeah.

29:34.070 --> 29:37.904
- I, uh, hated it.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.567
The plot was trite.
It was boring.

29:39.610 --> 29:40.702
It was insulting even.

29:40.740 --> 29:41.969
I'm dumber for
having watched it.

29:42.010 --> 29:44.877
I can't believe you enjoy
this, uh, drivel!

29:44.910 --> 29:46.400
-I'm 10.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.509
- No, look, you're
just the right age

29:48.550 --> 29:52.612
to hit the comedic jackpot
that is The Three Stooges.

29:52.650 --> 29:53.958
- That sounds lame.

29:53.990 --> 29:55.515
- Oh! Lame? Really?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.289
Let me ask you a question.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.255
Big bald guy gets hit
with a sack of wrenches

30:00.290 --> 30:03.624
then is poked in the eye
by a guy with a bowl cut.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.220
What? Funny or not?
- That's funny.

30:06.270 --> 30:10.332
- Yes! Good. Now, up in my room,
tons of Three Stooges DVDs.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.862
Pick any ones you want.
You'll thank me later.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.571
Yes! Go.
Very important.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.305
Go, go, go!

30:16.340 --> 30:17.774
(Door buzzing)

30:17.810 --> 30:18.902
Come in!

30:18.950 --> 30:21.373
Bernie will be down
in a second.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.788
- I feel like I should
pay you for baby-sitting.

30:24.820 --> 30:27.539
- Oh, no problem.
I do have one concern.

30:27.590 --> 30:30.287
Are you aware of the crappy
movies that he's watching?

30:30.320 --> 30:32.880
- Why are you two always
over here anyways?

30:32.930 --> 30:35.353
You should spend
some time at our house.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.698
You could.
come over tonight.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.198
Oh God!

30:40.230 --> 30:42.597
Am I being creepy mom?
- No!

30:42.640 --> 30:44.938
(Both chuckling)

30:44.970 --> 30:47.007
- I'll just blame
that on happy hour

30:47.040 --> 30:48.576
and half-priced Mojitos.

30:48.610 --> 30:50.533
(Chuckling,
running footsteps)

30:50.580 --> 30:53.470
- All right.
Here you go, pal.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.610
- See you, Aidan!

30:58.650 --> 30:59.879
- Bye, you two.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.513
(Door closing)

31:04.990 --> 31:06.754
(Siren in distance)

31:08.900 --> 31:10.959
(Both panting)

31:15.300 --> 31:17.598
- I don't know what
you were talking about.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.769
You controlled yourself
pretty well there, Mister.

31:22.810 --> 31:24.699
- (Whispering):
Oh my god! Oh my god!

31:24.750 --> 31:26.172
(Panting)

31:26.210 --> 31:27.769
(Clothing rustling)

31:29.780 --> 31:31.509
- Josh?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.053
Classy.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.410
(Panting)

31:40.530 --> 31:41.952
(Woman talking, indistinct)

31:42.000 --> 31:43.422
- I'm sorry.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.269
(Both talking,
indistinct)

31:47.900 --> 31:49.959
- Do you think Bernie
would like this?

31:52.010 --> 31:54.308
- Someone made
a new friend.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.138
- Shut up!

31:56.180 --> 31:57.705
- It's sweet.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.114
He could use an
older man in his life,

32:01.150 --> 32:04.415
and, uh, you could definitely
stand a little innocence.

32:04.450 --> 32:06.509
What's age, anyway?

32:06.550 --> 32:08.359
You're... what?

32:08.390 --> 32:09.983
- 257.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.181
- For real?

32:11.230 --> 32:12.425
(Door opening)

32:12.460 --> 32:14.224
- I ran out of time.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.455
Get everything breakable

32:15.500 --> 32:16.456
out of the room!

32:16.500 --> 32:17.922
- How much time do we have?

32:17.970 --> 32:19.267
- Minutes.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.859
Save the TV!

32:20.900 --> 32:22.891
- Whoa, whoa!
What's going on?

32:22.940 --> 32:25.238
- I'm changing.
- In the house?

32:25.270 --> 32:26.704
- Turn the stereo up loud.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.572
- But you just cleaned!

32:28.610 --> 32:29.600
(* Rock *)

32:29.640 --> 32:31.347
- Aaah! It's coming.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.405
Get out now.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.873
(Josh grunting)

32:35.920 --> 32:37.445
- Sally, come on!

32:37.480 --> 32:39.039
- I wanna see what happens.
- No!

32:39.090 --> 32:40.819
- Why not?
It's not like you can hurt me.

32:40.850 --> 32:43.512
- I don't care
about that! Aaah!

32:44.560 --> 32:45.721
(Panting)

32:45.760 --> 32:47.489
Fine, do whatever.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.419
Just stand where
I can't see you.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.224
- Are you sure?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.022
- (Sally): Yes!

32:53.070 --> 32:54.993
(* Man singing rock *)

33:01.540 --> 33:03.929
So, ballpark,
how long does it--

33:03.980 --> 33:06.449
(Screaming)

33:09.820 --> 33:11.242
(Screaming)

33:18.690 --> 33:21.557
(Josh screaming)

33:26.370 --> 33:27.622
(Roaring)

33:30.270 --> 33:32.364
(Bones cracking)

33:33.670 --> 33:35.877
(Roaring)

33:39.410 --> 33:40.900
Josh?

33:51.130 --> 33:53.656
(Growling)

33:56.300 --> 33:58.564
(Growling)

34:01.600 --> 34:03.136
(Glass breaking)

34:03.170 --> 34:05.559
I never imagined
it would happen like that...

34:05.610 --> 34:06.805
(Thudding and growling)

34:06.840 --> 34:08.774
...that that's what
he goes through.

34:08.810 --> 34:11.848
- Every 4 weeks for
the rest of his life.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.609
(Growling)

34:26.159 --> 34:28.822
(Dishes clinking)

34:38.110 --> 34:39.908
- Morning.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.609
- Are you OK?

34:44.679 --> 34:45.976
- Yeah.

34:46.010 --> 34:47.545
(Clears throat)

34:47.580 --> 34:50.277
I'm sorry about
last night.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.141
I never wanted
to bring it home.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.487
- You ran out of time.

34:57.790 --> 35:00.088
- I don't really know
what to say to you,

35:00.130 --> 35:01.928
'cause it's like
you've seen me naked,

35:01.960 --> 35:05.328
only way, way worse.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.169
- Just don't
say anything.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.931
And don't--don't apologize.

35:14.310 --> 35:16.608
I'm the one
who should be sorry,

35:16.640 --> 35:19.575
throwing a pity
party for myself

35:19.610 --> 35:22.341
and telling you
to suck it up.

35:25.150 --> 35:26.640
- Yeah.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.313
Not your most
gracious hour.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.325
(Whooshing)

35:38.730 --> 35:40.869
- When I saw you become--

35:40.900 --> 35:42.664
- Now you
get it, right?

35:42.700 --> 35:45.169
My--my hesitation
with people, with Nora.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.166
- I do.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.530
(Sighing)

35:47.570 --> 35:49.470
You have it so much
worse than me, Josh.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.178
(Whooshing)

35:56.580 --> 35:58.389
(Sighing)

35:58.420 --> 36:01.219
All the more reason
you deserve happiness.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.012
- Thank you.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.154
Now you have to leave.
- What?

36:07.190 --> 36:09.898
- Nora called and she's
a little rage-full.

36:09.930 --> 36:11.659
She's on her way over and
I have to clean this place up.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.623
And she already
thinks I'm a freak

36:13.670 --> 36:16.435
after jumping her bones
and running out on her.

36:16.470 --> 36:19.963
And when you're around,
odd things happen.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.229
And it's not your fault,
it's just they happen,

36:22.280 --> 36:23.600
'cause it's you,

36:23.640 --> 36:26.610
and, well, Nora,
she's a little--

36:26.650 --> 36:27.776
- She's scared of me.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.619
- No, she can't
even see you.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.485
Kind of.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.454
Yeah, she's scared of you.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.356
- Because I'm a monster too.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.154
- No, you're not
a monster.

36:38.190 --> 36:40.750
You're a... being.

36:40.790 --> 36:44.420
- Josh.
It's OK.

36:47.470 --> 36:49.564
When you say jumped her--
- No.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.965
- All right.
We'll talk later.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.001
- Yeah.
- Go.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.030
(Clearing throat)

36:59.250 --> 37:01.002
- It doesn't have
to be spotless.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.609
Just less Diary
of a Mad Man.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.641
- It's really not that bad.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.784
(Doorbell buzzing)

37:17.560 --> 37:21.963
- What kind of animal gives this
garbage to a 10 year-old boy?

37:23.800 --> 37:26.838
- Cindy, look, I--I don't know
what you think happened,

37:26.870 --> 37:27.962
but I didn't give
this to Bernie.

37:28.010 --> 37:29.273
How much did he see?

37:29.310 --> 37:32.109
- He saw exactly what you wanted
him to see, you monster,

37:32.150 --> 37:34.642
two people
screwing in a hotel.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.149
You come near Bernie again,
I'll kill you.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.982
- Cindy.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.181
Cindy, wait!

37:44.220 --> 37:45.756
Cindy, Cindy!

37:45.790 --> 37:48.293
I would never, never give
that stuff to Bernie.

37:48.330 --> 37:50.890
- Oh my god!
I am so stupid!

37:50.930 --> 37:52.091
I can't believe
I trusted you.

37:52.130 --> 37:53.268
I wanted
to trust you.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.790
"He's a good guy,"
I told myself.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.831
"He's a good neighbour.
Bernie needs that."

37:56.870 --> 37:58.133
- Cj--
- Don't talk to me!

37:58.170 --> 38:00.264
Don't ever
talk to me!

38:00.310 --> 38:02.005
- I am not like that!

38:02.040 --> 38:03.576
I am not some--

38:03.610 --> 38:04.577
(Sighing)

38:04.610 --> 38:05.941
- What? Say it.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.813
Pervert? 'Cause that's
what you are, right?

38:08.850 --> 38:11.581
Some sick piece of scum
that gets off on little kids.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.509
- Mom!

38:13.550 --> 38:15.382
I took it.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.053
- Why?

38:18.090 --> 38:19.455
- Aidan told me
to go up to his room

38:19.490 --> 38:21.254
to grab some
Three Stooges DVDs

38:21.290 --> 38:23.349
and I saw it sitting
on the shelf.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.220
I just wanted to see
what was on it.

38:25.270 --> 38:26.522
- Go in the house.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.561
-I'm so rry!
- Go! v

38:29.300 --> 38:33.066
- Cindy, I am so sorry.

38:33.110 --> 38:35.533
- Stay away
from my son.

38:39.310 --> 38:40.903
(Sighing)

38:53.260 --> 38:54.750
- You kept this. Why?

38:57.260 --> 38:58.898
- I don't know.

39:01.270 --> 39:03.432
I was gonna
throw it away, Josh,

39:03.470 --> 39:04.801
but then I thought:

39:04.840 --> 39:07.730
"I should keep this.
I deserve it.

39:07.770 --> 39:09.772
"I cut myself off
from everything else.

39:09.810 --> 39:11.471
"I can keep just
this one thing."

39:11.510 --> 39:14.741
- This one thing flies
in the face of--

39:15.750 --> 39:17.343
What are we doing?

39:17.380 --> 39:19.542
If you're gonna hold
onto things like this,

39:19.590 --> 39:21.149
what's the point?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.095
(Door slamming)

39:38.640 --> 39:41.678
- There he is,
Mr. Hit and Run.

39:42.780 --> 39:45.203
- Nora, I'm sorry.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.200
I'm--

39:48.210 --> 39:49.416
I know you're mad.

39:49.450 --> 39:50.679
- Mad?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.518
If my legs hadn't
been jellied,

39:52.550 --> 39:54.018
I would've
chased you down

39:54.050 --> 39:55.859
and kicked your ass
last night.

39:55.890 --> 39:59.326
- Yeah, about that,
the--the--the jellied legs.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.250
I mean,
I--I didn't do that.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.894
I--I'm--
I did, but I didn't.

40:04.930 --> 40:06.420
- [ Was--
I was there. You--

40:07.470 --> 40:08.494
You did

40:08.540 --> 40:11.066
and then you bolted on me.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.807
- I didn't bolt, I--

40:12.840 --> 40:15.104
I mean, I--I did.

40:15.140 --> 40:18.303
- OK, remember how I said
it's cute when you're awkward?

40:18.340 --> 40:20.240
This isn't cute.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.612
- I'm so sorry that
I left the way that I did.

40:22.650 --> 40:24.482
I'm mortified
by my behaviour.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.909
I'm not the kind of
guy who does that.

40:28.390 --> 40:32.588
I'm also not the kind of guy
who mounts women spontaneously

40:32.630 --> 40:35.053
and has furious animal sex.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.727
- You're not?

40:36.760 --> 40:38.922
- Not always.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.392
- Oh, thank God!

40:40.430 --> 40:41.397
(Laughing)

40:41.430 --> 40:44.263
I--I can't believe
I went with it myself.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.769
I mean, it was--
it was something else.

40:46.810 --> 40:48.005
(Both chuckling)

40:48.040 --> 40:50.179
But I--I--

40:50.210 --> 40:52.804
I don't know. It's just,
it's not really my style.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.170
(Sighing)

40:54.210 --> 40:56.679
I'm not a prude,
but I--I like more...

40:56.720 --> 40:58.347
- Romance?

40:58.380 --> 41:01.782
Yes, me too.
Courtship, all that.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.049
I'm--

41:03.090 --> 41:04.285
- Yeah.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.049
- Yeah.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.452
- I think there's--

41:09.500 --> 41:11.525
I think there's
something here...

41:12.570 --> 41:13.992
between us.

41:15.670 --> 41:19.959
Let's just take some time
to figure it out.

41:21.470 --> 41:23.029
- Yeah, I'd like that.

41:27.510 --> 41:31.048
** In the morning
getting out of bed *

41:31.080 --> 41:36.416
* One eye open
Covers on my head *

41:36.460 --> 41:40.328
* Seems the day's
already gone ahead *

41:40.360 --> 41:42.920
* Without me *

41:42.960 --> 41:45.964
* And that just suits me fine *

41:46.970 --> 41:49.393
* So far *

41:55.080 --> 42:00.041
* I've been counting all
the times I've been awake *

42:00.080 --> 42:03.641
* Over the last few days *

42:03.680 --> 42:06.945
* It seems I've finally
found the way *

42:06.990 --> 42:09.084
* To face mistakes *

42:10.660 --> 42:13.960
* T've got a fragile heart *

42:13.990 --> 42:17.290
* Since I left you *

42:17.330 --> 42:20.391
* So I'm looking
for a way *

42:20.430 --> 42:22.694
* That I can mend *

42:23.970 --> 42:28.203
* This fragile
Oh so fragile heart *

42:28.240 --> 42:29.776
* Since it left you *

42:30.810 --> 42:33.745
* But if I stay in bed *

42:33.780 --> 42:36.442
* I might just save the day *

42:44.760 --> 42:48.185
* T've got a fragile heart *

42:48.230 --> 42:51.359
* Since I left you *

42:51.400 --> 42:54.495
* So I'm looking for a way *

42:54.530 --> 42:57.431
* That I can mend *

42:57.470 --> 43:01.703
* This fragile
Oh so fragile heart *

43:01.740 --> 43:05.904
* Since it left you *

43:05.950 --> 43:07.770
* But if I stay in bed *

43:07.810 --> 43:10.211
* I might just save the day **
