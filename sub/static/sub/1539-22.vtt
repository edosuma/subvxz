<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

00:06.058 --> 00:09.461
You haven't, by chance,
seen Officer Doughtery?

00:09.495 --> 00:10.762
(groaning)

00:10.796 --> 00:12.163
<i>We were supposed to have dinner last night,</i>

00:12.198 --> 00:13.265
<i>and he didn't show.</i>

00:13.299 --> 00:15.734
No surprise, um, but I
haven't seen him today.

00:15.768 --> 00:17.102
Me, neither.

00:17.136 --> 00:19.437
Barbara, we're doing this for you.

00:22.308 --> 00:23.975
(gunshot, Lennon grunts, Barbara gasps)

00:24.010 --> 00:26.444
- He's dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

00:26.479 --> 00:27.946
It's gonna be okay.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.615
Bruce, your father was a true stoic.

00:30.650 --> 00:32.484
He kept his best self hidden.

00:32.518 --> 00:34.085
Your father was a good man.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.288
But even good men have secrets.

00:36.322 --> 00:38.924
You have a hard head,
James, just like your father.

00:38.958 --> 00:40.759
Gotham is on a knife edge,

00:40.793 --> 00:43.194
but I won't let it fall
apart without a fight.

Whoa.

01:26.272 --> 01:27.472
Good morning, child.

01:29.530 --> 01:31.664
We ain't children,

01:31.699 --> 01:34.567
and... it ain't morning.

01:34.602 --> 01:36.970
Oh, it will be soon.

02:12.955 --> 02:14.856
(TV news report continues, indistinctly)

02:16.592 --> 02:19.094
Still looking for secrets, are we, sir?

02:20.463 --> 02:22.431
Or just breaking stuff?

02:22.465 --> 02:24.466
Secrets.

02:25.301 --> 02:26.301
ALFRED: I don't know.

02:27.704 --> 02:29.805
Whole city's going doolally around us.

02:29.839 --> 02:34.242
I mean, there's a bloody
war on the streets...

02:34.277 --> 02:36.778
and you're in here worrying
about your poor old dad.

02:36.813 --> 02:38.947
Yes, I am.

02:38.981 --> 02:40.649
If your father had a secret life...

02:40.683 --> 02:42.317
Which I hasten to add, he didn't...

02:42.352 --> 02:43.719
I'd know about it, wouldn't I?

02:43.753 --> 02:46.221
A sober, diligent man he was.

02:46.255 --> 02:47.723
Never out gallivanting.

02:47.757 --> 02:49.992
Home every night, like clockwork,

02:50.026 --> 02:52.594
working, in this very room.

02:52.628 --> 02:54.496
Yes, I remember.

02:54.530 --> 02:56.798
I wasn't allowed to disturb
him while he was working.

02:56.833 --> 02:59.803
- Nobody was.
- Classical music...

02:59.841 --> 03:02.209
- he would play for hours.
- That's right.

03:02.243 --> 03:03.477
Mom and I would read books

03:03.511 --> 03:05.245
or play board games until he was done.

03:05.279 --> 03:08.081
I remember.

03:08.116 --> 03:10.083
I tried to sneak in to see him,

03:10.118 --> 03:13.887
but the door was locked.

03:13.921 --> 03:15.289
Was the door always locked, Alfred?

03:15.323 --> 03:17.991
Yeah, well, I suppose
so, when he was working.

03:18.026 --> 03:20.494
Why, though?

03:20.528 --> 03:22.729
Why lock the door?

03:22.764 --> 03:24.731
That's what doors are for, isn't it?

03:24.766 --> 03:27.134
It's in here.

03:27.168 --> 03:29.102
It's in this room.

03:29.137 --> 03:31.438
My father's secret, it's in this room.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.473
I know it.

03:33.508 --> 03:35.909
I know it!

03:35.944 --> 03:37.444
Uh...

03:37.478 --> 03:38.779
Oh!

Ah.

04:05.273 --> 04:07.374
Hello, young lady.

04:07.408 --> 04:10.477

04:58.626 --> 05:00.360
Officer Katz, right?

05:00.395 --> 05:02.362
Yes, sir, Katz, Griffin.

05:02.397 --> 05:04.231
Word of advice, Katz.

05:04.265 --> 05:06.600
I'm a dead duck around here.

05:06.634 --> 05:09.670
Brass are gonna fire me just as
soon as this gang war cools off.

05:09.704 --> 05:12.172
So don't salute me.

05:12.206 --> 05:14.207
Makes you look like a rube.

05:20.582 --> 05:23.016
GORDON: Hi.

05:23.051 --> 05:24.818
- Detective.
- Dr. Thompkins.

05:24.852 --> 05:26.053
Jim.

05:26.087 --> 05:28.088
Thanks for coming to see me.

05:28.122 --> 05:30.357
It's good to see you looking so well.

05:30.391 --> 05:31.758
I am well.

05:31.793 --> 05:33.193
Much better.

05:33.228 --> 05:34.761
Yes.

05:34.796 --> 05:36.797
You are. This is your last checkup.

05:36.831 --> 05:38.298
You are all healed physically.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.400
But you need to get some trauma counseling.

05:40.435 --> 05:43.237
Doc, I'm happy.

05:43.271 --> 05:45.939
I am happy to be alive.

05:45.974 --> 05:49.309
Which is why, Jim, I didn't want to leave

05:49.344 --> 05:51.411
without saying thank you properly.

05:52.914 --> 05:54.982
Thank you for saving my life.

05:56.117 --> 05:58.118
I was glad to do it.

05:59.287 --> 06:00.821
Miss Kean...

06:00.855 --> 06:03.056
trauma counseling, like, yesterday.

06:03.091 --> 06:04.958
I have several recommendations for you.

06:04.993 --> 06:07.661
- Really, Doc, I am fine.
- You're not fine.

06:07.695 --> 06:10.330
After what you've been
through, nobody would be fine.

06:10.365 --> 06:13.500
Fine. If you will be my counselor.

06:13.535 --> 06:16.937
And we do it at my place.

06:16.971 --> 06:19.973
No. I have some trauma training,

06:20.008 --> 06:22.109
but it's not my area of focus.

06:22.143 --> 06:23.343
I like you.

06:23.378 --> 06:25.279
Hey, I can talk to you.

06:25.313 --> 06:26.513
Please?

06:31.853 --> 06:33.820
Okay.

06:33.855 --> 06:35.455
Deal.

06:35.490 --> 06:37.624
Thank you.

06:37.659 --> 06:38.992
Hmm?

06:40.662 --> 06:42.496
All right, last warning to all of you!

06:42.530 --> 06:44.431
Don't free that guy!

06:44.465 --> 06:46.333
Hey, Jim, did you hear the news?

06:46.367 --> 06:47.801
Don Falcone just got hit.

06:47.835 --> 06:49.136
- Jim?
- What?!

06:49.170 --> 06:51.138
Falcone got hit 20 minutes ago.

06:51.172 --> 06:52.506
Maroni's boys blew up his car.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.007
- He's dead?
- No. He's at the hospital,

06:54.042 --> 06:56.043
- but he'll be dead soon enough.
- (sighs)

06:56.077 --> 06:59.179
Listen, Essen said City Hall
and the bigwigs okayed the hit.

06:59.214 --> 07:01.114
They switched their support to Maroni.

07:01.149 --> 07:03.116
Maroni? That hothead?

07:03.151 --> 07:04.551
They think he can run this city?

07:04.586 --> 07:05.786
- (phone ringing)
- Someone had to go.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.021
This war has been bad for business.

07:08.056 --> 07:10.057
Hello?

07:16.664 --> 07:18.665
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

07:21.603 --> 07:23.337
(grunting)

07:25.507 --> 07:27.941
(gasping)

07:27.976 --> 07:29.943
Hello?

07:29.978 --> 07:31.979
Hello!

07:32.013 --> 07:34.014
(baby crying in distance)

07:40.021 --> 07:42.022
(man coughing)

07:48.696 --> 07:51.832
(sighs)

07:51.866 --> 07:53.834
(door squeaks open)

07:53.868 --> 07:55.202
(door closes)

07:57.605 --> 07:59.706
Good morning. Good morning.

07:59.741 --> 08:01.608
Oh, Penguin, thank God.

08:01.643 --> 08:03.410
Get me out of here.

08:03.444 --> 08:05.279
Maroni's men will be here any minute.

08:05.313 --> 08:07.281
Yes, I imagine so.

08:07.315 --> 08:09.116
Mustn't stay long.

08:11.319 --> 08:13.287
But... I knew I'd regret it

08:13.321 --> 08:15.956
if I didn't say good-bye to you in person.

08:23.264 --> 08:25.299
It was me, old friend.

08:26.734 --> 08:28.202
I did this to you.

08:31.973 --> 08:34.241
I started the war.

08:34.275 --> 08:36.809
From the day I met you,
I was planning your end.

08:38.011 --> 08:40.714
I'm sorry it has to be in this...

08:40.748 --> 08:44.751
squalid little corner, but...

08:50.859 --> 08:53.727
c'est la vie.

08:53.761 --> 08:56.263
Why?

08:56.297 --> 08:59.833
Nothing personal, I assure you, sir.

08:59.868 --> 09:03.637
You have been a wise mentor

09:03.671 --> 09:06.707
and a good friend,

09:06.741 --> 09:09.343
but...

09:09.377 --> 09:10.777
business must come first.

09:10.812 --> 09:12.446
(snickers)

09:14.449 --> 09:17.251
I'm gonna take your place, old man.

09:17.285 --> 09:20.120
And I'm gonna be the
King of Gotham. (laughs)

09:20.155 --> 09:22.256
You?

09:22.290 --> 09:23.991
Never.

09:24.025 --> 09:26.760
You're going to burn in Hell.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.536
I do worry about that.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.538
(sniffles)

09:37.572 --> 09:40.841
But you first,

09:40.875 --> 09:43.277
old friend.

09:43.311 --> 09:46.847
You first.

09:46.881 --> 09:48.448
Nobody move!

09:48.483 --> 09:50.484
(grunts)

09:54.155 --> 09:57.391
- Walk away!
- Shut up.

09:57.425 --> 09:59.626
You're both under arrest
for attempted murder.

10:06.327 --> 10:07.892
(Oswald groans)

10:07.927 --> 10:10.061
Didn't you hear?

10:10.095 --> 10:11.996
Falcone is out by official decree.

10:12.031 --> 10:13.231
Everyone agreed.

10:13.265 --> 10:14.499
I heard.

10:14.533 --> 10:16.734
So, release me, Jim.

10:16.769 --> 10:18.336
Get on the winning side.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.732
Winning side, my ass.

10:20.783 --> 10:22.851
Maroni's a fool. He can't replace me.

10:22.885 --> 10:25.320
A thousand rivals will
jump up to challenge him.

10:25.355 --> 10:27.322
There'll be civil war.

10:27.357 --> 10:29.691
If I die now, Gotham falls apart.

10:29.726 --> 10:31.793
I agree, but can you turn things around?

10:31.828 --> 10:33.695
Can you take back control?

10:33.730 --> 10:35.764
Of course.

10:35.798 --> 10:37.766
Two days at my safe house.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.802
I need two days to make some moves,

10:40.837 --> 10:44.306
and I'll skin Maroni and those
disloyal scum like rabbits.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.841
OSWALD: Wake up, Napoleon!

10:45.875 --> 10:47.943
Maroni's louts are minutes away

10:47.977 --> 10:50.212
from coming here and cutting your throat,

10:50.246 --> 10:52.547
and the thing is, Jim,
they aren't very fond

10:52.582 --> 10:55.317
of me, either, so, seriously,

10:55.351 --> 10:57.886
you need to uncuff me... Jim?!

11:02.659 --> 11:04.626
(phone blips, beeps)

11:04.661 --> 11:06.328
(line ringing)

11:06.362 --> 11:07.996
Jim, where the hell'd you run off to?

11:08.031 --> 11:09.164
Harv,

11:09.198 --> 11:10.832
I'm in the hospital with Falcone.

11:10.867 --> 11:12.034
There's nobody here.

11:12.068 --> 11:14.236
No kidding. What the
hell are you doing there?

11:14.270 --> 11:15.504
You gotta get out now.

11:15.538 --> 11:17.272
They'll be coming back to finish him off.

11:17.307 --> 11:19.975
Yeah. Any moment now.

11:20.009 --> 11:21.743
Unless I get him out of here.

11:21.778 --> 11:23.211
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

11:23.246 --> 11:26.682
- I could use some help.
- No way. Are you nuts?

11:26.716 --> 11:29.384
He's a bad man, but he's
the best bad man we got.

11:29.419 --> 11:30.919
If Falcone loses control,

11:30.954 --> 11:33.488
Maroni's too wild to run Gotham.

11:33.523 --> 11:35.590
- There'll be anarchy.
- Yeah, probably,

11:35.625 --> 11:37.326
but Falcone already lost control.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.660
And he'll get it back.

11:38.695 --> 11:42.297
Listen, you're all twisted
over what happened to Barbara.

11:42.332 --> 11:43.999
You're not thinking straight.

11:44.033 --> 11:46.335
Yeah. Maybe.

11:46.369 --> 11:48.704
But I'm done in this town anyhow.

11:48.738 --> 11:52.107
- What do I have to lose?
- Your life. Huh?

11:52.141 --> 11:54.743
How 'bout your life?

11:54.777 --> 11:56.011
(phone beeps off)

11:56.045 --> 11:58.046
(phone snaps shut)

11:59.616 --> 12:01.950
What the hell are you doing here?

12:01.985 --> 12:05.187
I thought the fix was in with you guys.

12:08.691 --> 12:10.225
(chuckles)

12:17.734 --> 12:19.668
Can you walk?

12:19.702 --> 12:20.936
- If I have to.
- Let's get you

12:20.970 --> 12:22.738
out of here... I'll take
you to your safe house.

12:22.772 --> 12:24.806
Jim, my friend,

12:24.841 --> 12:27.042
you are making a terrible mistake.

12:27.076 --> 12:29.111
I'm doing this for the city,

12:29.145 --> 12:30.279
not you.

12:30.313 --> 12:31.813
You're the least worst option.

12:31.848 --> 12:33.815
If I didn't think you
could take back control,

12:33.850 --> 12:35.341
I'd let you die.

12:35.706 --> 12:38.487
- Just so we're clear.
- We're clear.

12:38.521 --> 12:40.489
You can't leave me here.

12:40.523 --> 12:42.324
Maroni's men will kill me!

12:42.358 --> 12:43.558
Possible.

12:43.593 --> 12:45.694
No. No, you-you arrested us.

12:45.728 --> 12:47.930
We are in your custody.

12:47.964 --> 12:49.831
That's true.

12:49.866 --> 12:51.900
You owe me a favor, Jim.

12:51.935 --> 12:53.502
You owe me!

12:53.536 --> 12:55.103
Damn it.

12:55.138 --> 12:57.372
LOEB (in distance): James Gordon!

12:58.841 --> 13:01.109
Detective Gordon!

13:13.056 --> 13:14.456
Don't kill 'em.

13:22.966 --> 13:24.933
Morning, fellas.

13:24.968 --> 13:26.401
What can I help you with?

13:26.436 --> 13:27.936
Yes, Gordon.

13:27.971 --> 13:30.272
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

13:30.306 --> 13:32.174
Go. Now.

13:32.208 --> 13:35.510
Why? So these men can kill Carmine Falcone?

13:35.545 --> 13:37.846
I have no knowledge of that.

13:37.880 --> 13:38.847
Go.

13:38.881 --> 13:40.616
That's an order.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.951
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

13:42.986 --> 13:46.255
I hope to see you behind bars very soon.

13:46.289 --> 13:47.923
Or dead.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.458
Whichever.

13:49.492 --> 13:53.462
Hope.

13:53.496 --> 13:55.163
It's for losers...

13:55.198 --> 13:57.199
Jim.

14:01.037 --> 14:04.039
<i>He's all yours!</i>

14:05.174 --> 14:07.476
(exhales)

14:14.350 --> 14:15.785
Get him!

14:20.356 --> 14:22.424
Move, move, move, move.

14:23.359 --> 14:25.260
(grunting)

14:27.530 --> 14:28.397
Aah!

14:36.940 --> 14:38.240
(guns blasting)

14:55.558 --> 14:57.025
(grunting)

15:08.338 --> 15:09.238
(shouts)

15:10.873 --> 15:12.207
Jim! Jim! Don't shoot! It's me!

15:12.242 --> 15:15.043
We gotta go... there are
ambulances in the basement.

15:15.078 --> 15:16.445
Where's your man?

15:16.479 --> 15:18.447
Uh...

15:18.481 --> 15:20.616
about that.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.951
We got to take Penguin and Gilzean, too.

15:22.986 --> 15:24.319
<i>- Penguin and Gilzean?
- I arrested 'em</i>

15:24.354 --> 15:26.088
for attempted murder.
They're in my custody.

15:26.122 --> 15:27.823
(groans) I don't even
want to argue with you.

15:27.857 --> 15:29.892
Come on! Let's go! Go!

15:29.926 --> 15:32.561
Tommy... Tommy!

15:32.595 --> 15:35.264
(engine revving, tires screeching)

15:35.298 --> 15:36.999
MAN: Boss! Boss! Look out!

15:37.033 --> 15:39.268
(gunfire, bullets clanking and popping)

15:39.302 --> 15:40.469
Get down!

15:46.476 --> 15:49.144
(tires screeching)

15:54.951 --> 15:56.952
Damn it.

16:07.696 --> 16:09.029
What exactly

16:09.064 --> 16:10.664
are we looking for, Master Bruce?

16:10.699 --> 16:14.602
When I find it, I'll know.

16:21.343 --> 16:23.344
(engine squeaking, clanking)

16:25.680 --> 16:27.681
(rumbling, squeaking)

16:29.351 --> 16:30.951
(engine sputters, stops)

16:33.054 --> 16:35.189
Nobody knows about this
place, right? Nobody?

16:35.223 --> 16:37.625
Nobody. Anybody who did is dead.

16:37.659 --> 16:40.060
We'll be safe here.

16:44.499 --> 16:46.000
Hello.

16:48.203 --> 16:50.504
What's up?

16:50.538 --> 16:52.740
(door rattling)

17:00.782 --> 17:03.817
I know, I know.

17:03.852 --> 17:05.819
It's astonishing.

17:05.854 --> 17:09.022
Sometimes I astonish myself.

17:12.986 --> 17:15.887
I feel like, uh,

17:15.923 --> 17:17.890
this is all a dream,

17:17.925 --> 17:20.093
and I'm gonna wake up soon.

17:23.997 --> 17:26.299
Barbara,

17:26.333 --> 17:28.367
you were abducted.

17:28.402 --> 17:31.337
Your parents were killed in front of you.

17:31.372 --> 17:33.373
Yeah. Yeah, that's real.

17:35.809 --> 17:39.779
I'm talking about this. Now. This...

17:39.813 --> 17:41.814
this is the dream.

17:41.849 --> 17:44.217
I'm gonna wake up

17:44.251 --> 17:45.885
and...

17:45.919 --> 17:48.888
he's still alive...

17:48.922 --> 17:51.924
and he's coming for me.

17:56.397 --> 17:59.298
<i>MOONEY: I thought for sure you were dead.</i>

17:59.333 --> 18:02.301
Let me look at you.

18:02.336 --> 18:04.003
Fish?

18:05.739 --> 18:10.176
Is it real... It's really you?

18:10.210 --> 18:14.080
It's... it's me, Butch. I'm home.

18:15.516 --> 18:19.018
My poor baby. What did they do to you?

18:19.053 --> 18:20.687
(panting)

18:20.721 --> 18:22.355
Nothing good.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.358
It's him, boss.

18:29.263 --> 18:32.231
Don Maroni.

18:32.266 --> 18:33.900
(chuckles softly)

18:33.934 --> 18:35.368
Yes.

18:35.402 --> 18:38.371
Alive and well.

18:38.405 --> 18:41.841
That's a long story.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.876
We need to talk.

18:44.878 --> 18:48.348
I have something you want.

18:48.382 --> 18:50.383
(grunting, gasping)

18:53.721 --> 18:56.723
They didn't find my knife.

18:57.758 --> 18:59.726
Ah.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.861
So we're saved then.

19:01.895 --> 19:03.663
It's in my sock.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.932
If you get the chance,
take some of them with us.

19:05.966 --> 19:07.433
I'll try.

19:07.468 --> 19:09.435
Hey, you.

19:09.470 --> 19:11.404
Selina, what are you doing here?

19:11.438 --> 19:14.040
Chillin'. How 'bout you?

19:14.074 --> 19:15.541
Kind of jammed up.

19:15.576 --> 19:16.943
Yeah.

19:16.977 --> 19:19.379
That's too bad.

19:24.351 --> 19:26.252
Oh...

19:26.287 --> 19:28.287
that's mime for "help us out here."

19:28.322 --> 19:29.789
- Eh.
- And totally blow

19:29.823 --> 19:33.259
the coolest gig ever just because we kinda,

19:33.294 --> 19:35.928
sorta know each other?

19:35.963 --> 19:37.297
Right?

19:37.331 --> 19:39.065
(sighs)

19:40.100 --> 19:42.101
Hello, fellas.

19:42.136 --> 19:45.505
Hmm. Carmine.

19:48.142 --> 19:49.976
Penguin.

19:50.010 --> 19:52.745
Nothing to share?

19:52.780 --> 19:54.647
Well, I have a little something.

19:54.682 --> 19:59.118
I just made a sweet deal with Maroni.

19:59.153 --> 20:02.455
He just told me I could
have all my territories back,

20:02.489 --> 20:04.424
and all I have to do in return...

20:06.093 --> 20:08.795
is give him Carmine's head.

20:10.397 --> 20:14.033
Uh, Fish, I-I need to go lie down.

20:14.068 --> 20:15.835
(exhales)

20:15.869 --> 20:19.872
What did you do to that
poor soul, you sadist?

20:19.907 --> 20:21.441
I assure you...

20:22.543 --> 20:24.177
You will die

20:24.211 --> 20:28.681
a slow, painful death on account of Butch.

20:28.716 --> 20:30.183
You, too, Carmine.

20:32.486 --> 20:34.187
You...

20:36.156 --> 20:38.691
We'll keep it simple.

20:40.094 --> 20:42.228
And you?

20:42.263 --> 20:44.631
We're cool.

20:44.665 --> 20:46.199
Any questions?

20:47.534 --> 20:48.868
How you gonna kill 'em?

20:52.239 --> 20:56.576
I love this girl.

20:56.610 --> 20:58.578
(Mooney cackling)

21:04.312 --> 21:06.471
<i>BARBARA: Jason saw right through me.</i>

21:06.534 --> 21:09.102
He knew me instantly.

21:09.136 --> 21:10.971
Like I was naked.

21:11.005 --> 21:13.306
It was scary...

21:13.341 --> 21:15.141
but thrilling.

21:15.176 --> 21:16.643
And...

21:16.677 --> 21:18.578
aren't...

21:18.613 --> 21:20.847
all the best guys

21:20.882 --> 21:23.016
a little scary?

21:23.050 --> 21:24.851
I was

21:24.886 --> 21:28.788
way more scared of Jim Gordon
the first date we went on.

21:28.823 --> 21:31.992
So butch and...

21:32.026 --> 21:33.894
stern.

21:33.928 --> 21:36.163
That type, they-they often

21:36.197 --> 21:38.165
have a bad temper.

21:38.199 --> 21:41.434
Hmm. But Jim was a sweetie.

21:41.469 --> 21:43.637
Never laid a finger on me.

21:43.671 --> 21:47.541
It was kind of surprising.

21:47.575 --> 21:48.909
Does he ever hit you?

21:48.943 --> 21:51.812
Me? No. Why?

21:51.846 --> 21:53.513
Wh-Why would he hit anyone?

21:53.548 --> 21:54.648
Any woman?

21:54.682 --> 21:56.583
You know.

21:56.617 --> 21:58.485
Out of passion.

22:01.589 --> 22:04.524
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

22:04.559 --> 22:06.693
Only I heard you and Jim were dating.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.995
No.

22:10.298 --> 22:11.665
(laughs softly)

22:11.699 --> 22:13.900
Y-Yes, we've been on a few dates.

22:13.935 --> 22:16.169
I'm sorry, I didn't think that you knew.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.672
If that makes you
uncomfortable in any way...

22:18.706 --> 22:21.441
(laughing): No. Don't be silly.

22:21.475 --> 22:23.777
I, uh... I'm happy for you.

22:23.811 --> 22:26.713
He's one of the good guys.

22:26.747 --> 22:29.449
Yeah, he is.

22:29.483 --> 22:31.084
Hey, you hungry?

22:41.128 --> 22:43.263
FISH: So, there he is.

22:43.297 --> 22:47.868
MARONI: Fish, you
mysterious, crazy, gorgeous

22:47.902 --> 22:49.069
killer, you.

22:49.103 --> 22:50.403
- I love ya.
- (chuckles)

22:50.438 --> 22:51.705
Come here. (grunts)

22:54.842 --> 22:56.476
This...

22:56.511 --> 22:59.045
this is delicious.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.647
Finally.

23:00.681 --> 23:03.750
- You're hard to kill, old man.
- No.

23:03.784 --> 23:05.919
Your people are second-rate.

23:05.953 --> 23:07.120
(scoffs)

23:08.456 --> 23:10.123
OSWALD: Miss Mooney,
if I may, a brief word.

23:10.157 --> 23:12.459
I know my life is forfeit.

23:12.493 --> 23:15.762
I speak not for my sake, but yours.

23:15.796 --> 23:16.997
(panting): Because...

23:17.031 --> 23:18.632
after all,

23:18.666 --> 23:20.467
I still love and respect you.

23:20.501 --> 23:23.270
Kill me if you must,

23:23.304 --> 23:26.006
but keep Falcone alive.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.642
As soon as he's dead,
Maroni has no use for you.

23:28.676 --> 23:30.944
You are simply a threat. He will kill you.

23:30.978 --> 23:32.412
Oh!

23:32.446 --> 23:34.114
You think?

23:34.148 --> 23:36.449
Why would he need another boss in town?

23:36.484 --> 23:37.684
Another rival?

23:37.718 --> 23:38.985
That's where you're wrong, smart guy.

23:40.321 --> 23:41.855
(A) She's not a rival,

23:41.889 --> 23:43.590
because she's not a boss.

23:43.624 --> 23:44.925
She's an underboss.

23:44.959 --> 23:47.727
An underboss takes orders.

23:47.762 --> 23:49.763
I don't take orders.

23:49.797 --> 23:51.531
- MARONI: I know that.
- We're cool.

23:51.566 --> 23:52.933
Relax.

23:53.968 --> 23:55.602
I'm relaxed.

23:55.636 --> 23:57.204
I don't think you are, babes.

24:00.074 --> 24:02.842
Please don't call me babes.

24:02.877 --> 24:04.044
MARONI: You see?

24:04.078 --> 24:06.446
Not relaxed.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.516
Babes? Really?

24:09.550 --> 24:12.052
It's a term of endearment.

24:12.086 --> 24:14.221
It means I like you.

24:15.256 --> 24:18.124
Fine. I misspoke.

24:18.159 --> 24:20.801
You're not an underboss
and you're not a babe.

24:21.116 --> 24:23.730
You tell me what you are.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.801
What we are, Sal...

24:29.537 --> 24:31.538
are partners.

24:31.572 --> 24:33.506
MARONI: Whatever you want.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.775
Partners.

24:35.810 --> 24:38.078
I'm partner number one,

24:38.112 --> 24:40.180
and you're partner number two.

24:40.214 --> 24:42.816
That's the deal, right?

24:42.850 --> 24:44.951
I'm number one...

24:44.986 --> 24:47.053
and you are...?

24:50.124 --> 24:51.758
Number two.

24:51.792 --> 24:53.894
MARONI: There you go. Simple math.

24:53.928 --> 24:56.663
One, two, babes. Oops.

24:56.697 --> 24:58.732
Sorry.

24:58.766 --> 25:01.201
That's the last time. I swear.

25:06.874 --> 25:08.108
Guys!

25:08.142 --> 25:10.777
Can you feel the buzz in the air?

25:10.811 --> 25:13.179
That's victory.

25:13.214 --> 25:14.614
Redemption.

25:14.649 --> 25:16.750
Power!

25:16.784 --> 25:18.451
When this old man dies,

25:18.486 --> 25:20.920
a new day begins.

25:20.955 --> 25:23.390
We will rule Gotham.

25:23.424 --> 25:25.692
We are building a dynasty.

25:25.726 --> 25:28.962
We will whip this town

25:28.996 --> 25:31.765
like a rented mule.

25:31.799 --> 25:33.566
Right, babes?

25:33.601 --> 25:35.435
(others chuckling)

25:35.469 --> 25:37.837
(chuckling): Oh-ho,
just... all right, relax.

25:37.872 --> 25:39.406
I'm kidding you.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.941
(chuckles)

25:40.975 --> 25:42.976
Guys, no, seriously.

25:43.978 --> 25:45.946
Don't call her "babes."

25:45.980 --> 25:48.882
Or "toots" or what have you.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.583
It's a woman's lib thing.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.957
<i>I am relaxed.</i>

26:02.830 --> 26:06.299
(gunfire, shouting)

26:11.105 --> 26:12.105
GORDON: Let's go!

26:12.139 --> 26:13.506
(gasping)

26:23.071 --> 26:25.206
Barbara, we've been
circling around the subject,

26:25.240 --> 26:29.210
but haven't talked about
what actually happened to you;

26:29.244 --> 26:31.378
wh-what was done to you.

26:31.413 --> 26:32.646
Lee...

26:32.681 --> 26:34.682
you're a nice lady.

26:36.451 --> 26:37.885
I could go there,

26:37.919 --> 26:40.554
but I'm not sure you
want to go there with me.

26:40.589 --> 26:42.690
Don't worry about me.

26:43.959 --> 26:47.261
(helicopter flying over)

26:47.295 --> 26:49.296
(sighs quietly)

26:51.177 --> 26:53.612
Has Jim told you he loves you?

26:53.646 --> 26:55.413
- Barbara...
- Fair is fair.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.649
I'm telling you all my little secrets.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.452
No, he hasn't.

27:00.486 --> 27:03.622
But he will, though, won't he?

27:03.656 --> 27:05.657
You can feel it coming?

27:05.691 --> 27:07.525
I mean, come on, look at you.

27:07.560 --> 27:11.029
You're gorgeous and smart...
Of course he loves you.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.364
Do you love him?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.432
Barbara...

27:17.270 --> 27:19.304
Tell me what happened.

27:21.374 --> 27:23.375
(yelling and gunfire in distance)

27:27.213 --> 27:29.681
If we can get to 7th
Avenue without being spotted

27:29.715 --> 27:31.683
by Fisher's people, we're home free.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.786
- Then what?
- We find a safe place, regroup.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.955
Maroni's death is a lucky break for you.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.057
Spoken like a true mafioso.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.459
You're the least worst
option, like you said.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.428
Without you, the city falls apart.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.564
Yes, I said that, and it might be true,

27:46.599 --> 27:48.366
but this has been a long day

27:48.401 --> 27:50.001
and I've had a long time

27:50.036 --> 27:51.703
to look at this world I've created.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.772
I'm done with this business.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.173
I'm out.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.509
I've got a place down south I can go to.

27:57.543 --> 28:00.378
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

28:00.413 --> 28:02.814
I know. I'm letting you down.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.150
I'm letting the city down. I know.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.318
(door slams)

28:06.352 --> 28:07.986
MAN: Hey, I heard something.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.088
MAN 2: Yeah, flash it this way.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.657
Down here, down here!

28:12.692 --> 28:15.627
Okay, plan B.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.403
(men talking in distance)

28:25.438 --> 28:27.572
Keep the light up.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.279
So you got a place down south, huh?

28:34.313 --> 28:36.047
Nice? On the water?

28:36.082 --> 28:37.716
Yes.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.718
Any work for beat-up old cops?

28:39.752 --> 28:41.052
Sure.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.687
How's that sound, Jim?

28:42.722 --> 28:44.623
Beaches, sunshine, fishing...

28:44.657 --> 28:46.191
Yeah, tempting.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.593
Hello again.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.631
Cat got your tongue?

28:58.638 --> 29:00.472
(whispers): Yes!

29:04.744 --> 29:05.944
Selena.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.712
Boys.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.781
Bless you.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.449
Got to hand it to you, Fish.

29:11.484 --> 29:14.252
You really know how to stop a
show. I couldn't help myself,

29:14.287 --> 29:16.888
Harvey, the man vexed me.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.490
Crazy move.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.825
Possibly a good move, too. We'll see.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.028
The battlefield is in flux.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.880
You could be looking at
the new Queen of Gotham.

29:25.918 --> 29:28.519
Congratulations, my dear.

29:28.554 --> 29:29.787
I'm quitting, Fish.

29:29.821 --> 29:31.355
I'm out.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.124
Does this mean I don't have to kill you?

29:33.158 --> 29:35.359
You're gonna retire

29:35.394 --> 29:37.328
someplace warm, lay back,

29:37.362 --> 29:39.196
read your little funny papers?

29:39.231 --> 29:41.365
- That was the thought.
- Yeah.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.967
Nice thought.

29:46.572 --> 29:47.371
(yells)

29:52.811 --> 29:55.513
(panting)

29:56.782 --> 29:57.782
OSWALD: Fish!

29:59.785 --> 30:01.485
(panting)

30:01.520 --> 30:02.987
Please, no.

30:04.857 --> 30:06.657
Fish!

30:06.692 --> 30:08.759
Where are you?!

30:11.096 --> 30:12.597
(gasping)

30:14.166 --> 30:16.000
Go!

30:16.034 --> 30:18.402
(gasps, grunts)

30:22.341 --> 30:24.175
(tires squealing, engine revving)

30:34.887 --> 30:36.287
(sighs softly)

30:36.321 --> 30:38.956
Then he left me.

30:38.991 --> 30:41.526
For a long time.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.928
Alone.

30:43.962 --> 30:46.464
And I slept.

30:46.498 --> 30:48.533
I don't know for how long.

30:48.567 --> 30:51.502
And then he woke me up.

30:51.537 --> 30:54.605
(helicopter flying
over) Road trip, he said.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.864
We were halfway there when...

30:58.944 --> 31:01.045
I realized...

31:04.316 --> 31:06.450
we were going to my parents' house.

31:07.486 --> 31:09.887
Go on.

31:09.922 --> 31:13.191
Well, then he tied them up to a chair...

31:14.993 --> 31:16.661
and, uh...

31:16.695 --> 31:20.565
he told me to talk to them...

31:20.599 --> 31:22.733
about my childhood issues.

31:22.768 --> 31:24.502
So I did.

31:24.536 --> 31:25.736
I...

31:25.771 --> 31:29.540
just... told them
whatever came into my head.

31:29.575 --> 31:32.376
And what came into your head?

31:32.411 --> 31:33.878
You know...

31:33.912 --> 31:36.547
just stupid kid stuff, I guess,

31:36.582 --> 31:39.250
like, uh...

31:39.284 --> 31:42.753
my mom used to call me her
little piggy when I was little.

31:42.788 --> 31:45.423
They threw away my posters.

31:45.457 --> 31:48.392
Never nurtured my self-esteem.

31:48.427 --> 31:50.761
Just slowly...

31:50.796 --> 31:53.931
steadily...

31:53.966 --> 31:56.801
grinding away at my soul.

31:58.904 --> 32:01.639
Trying to make me...

32:01.673 --> 32:03.207
disappear.

32:04.243 --> 32:07.011
That's not kid stuff.

32:07.045 --> 32:10.781
To be fair to them...

32:10.816 --> 32:13.451
they simply never understood me.

32:15.053 --> 32:17.788
They have no clue

32:17.823 --> 32:20.358
who I am.

32:21.393 --> 32:23.895
Even when I was killing them,

32:23.929 --> 32:25.696
they just gaped at me...

32:25.731 --> 32:27.765
like fools.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.635
No understanding.

32:30.669 --> 32:32.670
Barbara...

32:32.704 --> 32:34.839
Jason Lennon killed your parents.

32:34.873 --> 32:36.774
You didn't kill them.

32:38.777 --> 32:40.478
Yes, I did.

32:42.948 --> 32:44.916
I stabbed them...

32:44.950 --> 32:47.919
several times...

32:47.953 --> 32:50.288
and then I slit their throats.

32:59.366 --> 33:00.733
I'd like to leave now, please.

33:00.767 --> 33:02.267
You uncomfortable?

33:03.803 --> 33:05.070
How about now?

33:07.273 --> 33:09.008
(door opens)

33:18.683 --> 33:20.974
(Barbara grunting, banging against door)

33:20.999 --> 33:23.100
- (phone beeping)
- Damn.

33:28.740 --> 33:29.907
(elevator bell dings)

33:32.944 --> 33:34.945
(dog whimpers quietly)

33:40.685 --> 33:42.686
(grunts)

33:48.793 --> 33:53.397
(growling, screaming)

33:57.168 --> 33:58.402
(grunts)

34:05.109 --> 34:06.109
Aah!

34:23.228 --> 34:25.629
Lee.

34:25.663 --> 34:29.406
She... She just... She just went crazy.

34:33.385 --> 34:35.239
Told him that woman was trouble.

34:39.643 --> 34:41.812
(groaning, panting)

34:51.121 --> 34:52.556
(yelling)

34:52.590 --> 34:53.857
(grunting)

34:58.830 --> 34:59.830
(grunting)

35:07.605 --> 35:08.705
(screams) Aah!

35:15.680 --> 35:16.680
(screams)

35:16.714 --> 35:19.383
(grunting)

35:21.719 --> 35:23.020
Butch.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.655
About time.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.924
- Shoot her, Butch.
- Oh, really?

35:26.958 --> 35:30.561
Do as I say, Butch. Shoot her.

35:32.605 --> 35:35.073
What are you doing? Drop him.

35:35.107 --> 35:37.409
(groaning in distress) My friend,

35:37.443 --> 35:38.777
remember your training.

35:38.811 --> 35:40.712
- I order you to shoot her!
- Aah!

35:40.746 --> 35:42.147
Butch!

35:42.181 --> 35:45.216
Don't listen to him. He
did something to your mind.

35:45.251 --> 35:46.684
I'm your girl.

35:46.719 --> 35:48.586
Remember, I'm your girl.

35:48.621 --> 35:49.921
Kill her now!

35:49.955 --> 35:51.456
(grunting)

35:52.091 --> 35:53.625
Oh!

35:53.659 --> 35:55.393
Aah! Oh.

35:56.629 --> 35:58.596
(moaning)

35:58.631 --> 36:00.365
FISH: Butch...

36:00.399 --> 36:01.966
Oh, my God, what did I do?

36:03.936 --> 36:05.070
I'm so sorry.

36:05.104 --> 36:06.571
I'm so sorry, I would never hurt you.

36:06.605 --> 36:09.407
- I love you, Fish.
- It's okay.

36:09.442 --> 36:11.476
It's not your fault. I love you too.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.144
He messed with your mind.

36:13.179 --> 36:14.479
It's not your fault.

36:14.513 --> 36:16.314
I'm gonna be fine.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.782
You know me.

36:17.817 --> 36:20.685
OSWALD: Aah! (groans)

36:22.154 --> 36:24.622
(laughs slowly)

36:24.657 --> 36:26.591
Good-bye, Fish.

36:26.625 --> 36:28.960
It's all good.

36:28.994 --> 36:32.397
(screaming)

36:32.431 --> 36:33.665
- No!
- (shrieks)

36:36.669 --> 36:38.003
(distant splash)

36:47.313 --> 36:50.515
- (thunder rumbles)
- I'm the King of Gotham.

36:50.549 --> 36:54.219
(cackling)

36:54.253 --> 36:56.354
I'm the King of Gotham!

36:56.389 --> 36:58.356
(thunder rumbles)

36:58.391 --> 37:00.825
I'm the King of Gotham!

37:00.860 --> 37:03.261
(laughing)

37:04.296 --> 37:07.699
(footsteps approaching) Mr. Nygma.

37:07.733 --> 37:09.034
Miss Kringle.

37:12.038 --> 37:14.539
I just noticed something really weird.

37:14.573 --> 37:16.574
Oh?

37:21.047 --> 37:23.915
This note Officer Dougherty left for me...

37:23.949 --> 37:26.885
The first letter of every
line spells out your name.

37:29.555 --> 37:30.822
You see?

37:30.856 --> 37:33.725
N, Y...

37:33.759 --> 37:36.628
G...

37:36.662 --> 37:39.030
M, A.

37:39.065 --> 37:40.699
Yes.

37:40.733 --> 37:43.101
How, that... How-How odd.

37:43.135 --> 37:47.105
What-What a... What
an amazing coincidence.

37:47.139 --> 37:50.442
- Coincidence?
- What else could it be?

37:52.511 --> 37:54.379
So you know nothing about this?

37:54.413 --> 37:55.680
I... Me? No.

37:55.715 --> 37:57.182
No.

37:57.216 --> 38:00.752
No.

38:00.786 --> 38:02.921
Huh.

38:19.038 --> 38:21.873
(laughing quietly)

38:23.442 --> 38:25.477
<i>DOUGHERTY: You're the
guy that likes riddles.</i>

38:25.511 --> 38:27.579
Why are you laughing,
you fool? It's not funny.

38:27.613 --> 38:29.447
What a creep.

38:29.482 --> 38:31.816
She'll keep digging.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.219
Why did you have to leave a clue? Why?

38:34.253 --> 38:36.721
Relax.

38:36.756 --> 38:39.057
What can she find? What can she prove?

38:39.091 --> 38:41.159
Nothing. There's no body. Stop worrying.

38:43.262 --> 38:44.496
But she looks so sad and angry.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.131
I hate it when she looks at me that way.

38:46.165 --> 38:47.165
<i>KRINGLE: Menacing and weird.</i>

38:47.199 --> 38:49.267
- Please.
- Like it matters,

38:49.301 --> 38:51.002
like you stand a chance with her.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.470
She knows how you feel about her and she

38:52.505 --> 38:54.339
<i>treats you like dirt. Treats you like dirt.</i>

38:54.373 --> 38:56.841
I don't care, I still love her.

38:56.876 --> 39:00.178
Oh, listen to yourself. Be a man!

39:00.212 --> 39:01.646
(laughing)

39:01.680 --> 39:04.149
You'll do better with that one
if she's a little scared of you.

39:04.183 --> 39:06.351
<i>- Stop talking like that.
- GORDON: No riddles.</i>

39:06.385 --> 39:08.920
<i>- ESSEN: Formal complaints about you.
-  Just keeping it real.</i>

39:08.954 --> 39:11.022
What's black and white
and red all over? Stop it!

39:11.057 --> 39:13.124
<i>FLASS: I wouldn't quit
your day job if I were you.</i>

39:13.159 --> 39:16.161
(laughing)

39:21.300 --> 39:24.969
<i>KRINGLE: He is... so weird.
 (distorted):  So... so...</i>

39:25.004 --> 39:27.672
(helicopter flying over, siren wailing)

39:37.416 --> 39:38.950
Beautiful, huh?

39:38.984 --> 39:41.164
I'm gonna miss this town.

39:41.239 --> 39:42.954
You won't change your mind?

39:44.657 --> 39:47.358
- The town needs you.
- No.

39:47.393 --> 39:51.396
Gotham needs a lawman now.
Not a criminal like me.

39:52.998 --> 39:54.699
A strong lawman.

39:57.837 --> 39:59.304
You looking at me?

39:59.338 --> 40:02.574
Someone needs to grab this city
by the neck and shake it hard.

40:02.608 --> 40:04.576
That's you, Jim.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.245
I know it in my bones.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.747
There's a lot of powerful men

40:08.781 --> 40:11.015
who would disagree with you on that.

40:16.188 --> 40:18.189
Nice knife, huh?

40:25.698 --> 40:27.232
That was your father's.

40:27.266 --> 40:29.934
He gave it to me a long time ago.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.170
A spur-of-the-moment
birthday gift.

40:32.204 --> 40:33.705
I said no.

40:33.739 --> 40:35.507
Such a beautiful knife,

40:35.541 --> 40:38.510
and I have men with guns to protect me.

40:38.544 --> 40:40.412
He said take it.

40:40.446 --> 40:43.415
A knife is a good friend
when you have no other.

40:43.449 --> 40:46.584
You were that close.

40:47.753 --> 40:49.421
At one time.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.861
The point of the story, Jim...

40:56.896 --> 41:00.165
Your father was the most
honest man I ever met.

41:00.199 --> 41:03.268
But he carried a knife.

41:17.349 --> 41:19.584
<i>ALFRED: Enough searching, Master B.</i>

41:19.618 --> 41:21.619
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

41:24.757 --> 41:26.257
Now, your father was a good man,

41:26.292 --> 41:28.393
a flawed man, like anyone else.

41:28.427 --> 41:29.961
Doesn't mean he had a secret life.

41:29.995 --> 41:32.230
My intuition's nearly always correct.

41:32.264 --> 41:34.132
Yeah, well.

41:34.166 --> 41:36.801
It's a common delusion, I find.

41:38.471 --> 41:41.573
Arkham's full of men whose
intuitions are always correct.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.976
There are none so blind.

41:50.950 --> 41:52.450
None so blind.

41:53.953 --> 41:56.354
Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius!

41:56.388 --> 41:57.822
What about him?

41:59.725 --> 42:01.192
He was a Roman emperor.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.495
Yes, well, I'm fully aware
of that, Master Bruce.

42:03.529 --> 42:05.897
And a stoic. I think I
remember he was a stoic,

42:05.931 --> 42:09.000
like my father.

42:09.034 --> 42:11.536
Lucius Fox called my father a stoic.

42:11.570 --> 42:14.973
Lots of people are called stoic.

42:15.007 --> 42:16.975
Basically means a
hardnut. Doesn't say much.

42:17.009 --> 42:18.543
Doesn't mean it's a bloody clue, does it?

42:18.577 --> 42:21.980
It's a philosophy,
Alfred. It's a way of life.

42:22.014 --> 42:25.683
Maybe... Maybe that as
well, I suppose, but...

42:28.654 --> 42:29.621
Ah!

42:29.655 --> 42:30.855
Oh...

42:37.530 --> 42:39.964
What is it, do you think?

42:39.999 --> 42:41.166
I don't know and I don't care,

42:41.200 --> 42:42.567
and don't you dare
press that bloody button.

42:42.601 --> 42:45.637
Why not? It could be a bomb.

42:45.671 --> 42:48.072
Alfred, that seems improbable.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.714
It's a stereo.

42:57.816 --> 42:59.317
(stone grinding)

43:24.076 --> 43:25.376
(leathery wings fluttering)
