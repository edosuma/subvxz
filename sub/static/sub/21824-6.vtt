WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.001
Previously...

00:03.080 --> 00:04.081
Come with me through the stones.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.931
No, I can't.
My destiny lies on Culloden Moor.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.605
So, if our theory is correct,

00:08.680 --> 00:13.208
Jamie's alive 20 years
after Culloden, so 1766.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.445
I found him.
"Freedom and whiskey gang thegither."

00:16.520 --> 00:18.887
Only someone with knowledge of the future

00:18.960 --> 00:21.361
could have quoted lines
that hadn't been written yet.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.529
Have a look at the printers name.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.320
Alexander Malcolm.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.924
Alexander Malcolm? This is Jamie.
You can go back.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.287
We all have our secrets.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.283
Anyone with half an eye can see it.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.283
It won't be long
before Young Willie sees it himself

00:35.800 --> 00:38.963
If I go, we may never
see each other again.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.449
Can you live with that?
'Cause I don't know if I can.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.489
You gave Jamie up for me.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.844
Now I have to give him back to you.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.481
There.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.041
Cannot have you
strolling along High Street

00:54.120 --> 00:55.724
with your stock half done.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.041
Well...

00:57.720 --> 01:00.200
Ye have the advantage
of peering directly at it.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.726
Or perhaps it takes a woman's touch
to do things properly.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.680
I'll not argue that matter.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.084
Wise man.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.561
Morning.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.081
He's coming.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.326
Ye can come out.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.007
The stench of seaweed
and whiskey betrayed ye.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.089
Not to worry, Mac Dubh. It's just us.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.646
Young Ian said
we could sleep here last night.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.371
We lost our beds at the boarding house.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.681
Been sleeping in a cosh
down near the docks.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.524
Ye didn't come in the front door, did ye?

03:39.600 --> 03:41.568
I told ye he'd be upset with us.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.881
I told ye not to be seen here in daylight.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.284
This business can't afford
to be associated with the likes of you.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.691
Dinna fash, Mac Dubh.

03:48.760 --> 03:52.845
We come when it was pitch black outside.
None save an owl could've recognised us.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.770
Well, since you're here,
ye can make yourselves useful.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.601
These...

03:58.320 --> 03:59.890
are to go to Arbroath.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.562
The owner of The Three Thistles
is a papist.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.730
Deliver these to him.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.445
Once you've handed them over,

04:13.960 --> 04:17.601
dinna linger about to judge
the quality of the local women or drink.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.207
We didna plan to.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.482
Ye did plan to.
That's why I told ye not to do it.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.045
Ye dinna trust us, Mac Dubh?

04:24.520 --> 04:25.726
I trust ye with my life.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.768
Trouble is,
I dinna trust you with yer own.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.646
Be mindful.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.561
These are naught but treason.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.331
Caught, and your necks are in ropes.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.005
I see the riffraff's here... again.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.481
A pleasant morning to ye, Geordie.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.404
That boil on your neck's getting larger.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.802
Ye might want to have that lanced
before ye ignite the next plague.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.326
It's a goiter, and it's not infectious.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.803
Appears you have a small child
hanging on yer every word.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.843
Since I am in yer service,
I must come here,

04:59.920 --> 05:03.163
but must I also be subjected
to yer cohorts' ridicule?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.243
No. No, yer right.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.211
We mean ne harm by it.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.647
Aye. Just means we're fond of ye, is all.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.850
Well, pardon me
if I don't welcome that sort of amity.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.207
Out the back. Be quick about it.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.691
- Before any customers arrive.
- Aye, Mac Dubh.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.765
Before ye start yer day, Geordie,
we need more soda ash for the presses.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.841
Of course.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.131
Perhaps this evening,
before I leave for the day,

05:38.200 --> 05:41.682
you might share any chores
or errands ye'd care to have done,

05:41.760 --> 05:44.525
so I can carry them out
on my way into the shop.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.887
So I'm no' re-travelling my steps.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.080
Is that you, Geordie?

07:13.560 --> 07:15.005
Took ye long enough.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.291
Where'd you go to get the ash?
All the way to Glasgow?

07:25.600 --> 07:26.647
It isn't Geordie.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.561
It's me...

07:35.960 --> 07:36.961
Claire.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.966
Sing me a song

08:11.040 --> 08:13.771
Of a lass that is gone

08:14.040 --> 08:16.691
Say, could that lass

08:16.760 --> 08:18.728
Be I?

08:19.680 --> 08:21.728
Merry of soul

08:21.800 --> 08:24.770
She sailed on a day

08:24.840 --> 08:26.922
Over the sea

08:27.000 --> 08:29.321
To Skye

08:30.120 --> 08:32.691
Billow and breeze

08:32.760 --> 08:35.206
Islands and seas

08:35.280 --> 08:39.808
Mountains of rain and sun

08:40.559 --> 08:42.562
All that was good

08:43.039 --> 08:44.929
All that was fair

08:45.720 --> 08:47.802
All that was me

08:47.920 --> 08:50.366
Is gone

08:50.840 --> 08:53.127
Sing me a song

08:53.200 --> 08:56.044
Of a lass that is gone

08:56.120 --> 08:57.929
Say, could that lass

08:58.520 --> 09:00.249
Be I?

09:01.400 --> 09:03.528
Merry of soul

09:03.600 --> 09:06.444
She sailed on a day

09:06.520 --> 09:10.047
Over the sea

09:10.760 --> 09:15.721
To Skye

09:57.480 --> 09:58.561
You're real.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.641
So are you.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.249
I thought you were dead.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.881
Claire...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.240
What is it?

10:24.920 --> 10:27.287
I thought I'd lost hold altogether
and pissed myself,

10:27.360 --> 10:28.930
but it's all right.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.161
Just spilled the ale-pot.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.401
Do you mind?

10:44.280 --> 10:45.645
It's all right.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.241
We are married.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.561
At least, I suppose we are.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.041
Aye.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.286
We are.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.645
I never took it off.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.761
I want...

11:50.240 --> 11:51.241
I would...

11:52.040 --> 11:53.485
very much like to kiss you.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.041
May I?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.121
Yes.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.562
I havena done this in a very long time.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.089
I saw you so many times.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.850
Ye came to me so often...

12:46.160 --> 12:47.924
When I dreamed sometimes...

12:51.800 --> 12:53.131
When I was in a fever.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.204
I was so afraid and so lonely,
I knew I must die.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.884
Whenever I needed you,
I would see you, smiling...

13:04.120 --> 13:06.771
Your hair curled around your face.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.171
You never touched me.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.049
I can touch you now.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.524
Do not be afraid.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.845
There's the two of us now.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.285
I Quit!

13:50.320 --> 13:51.765
I'm Free Church.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.444
Working for a papist is one thing,

13:53.560 --> 13:55.642
but working for
an immoral papist is another.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.767
Geordie...

13:56.840 --> 13:58.205
Do as you like with yer own soul, man,

13:58.280 --> 14:02.649
but if it's come to orgies in the shop,
it's come too far.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.567
Oh, God's tooth. It's not even noon.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.764
I hope I haven't caused you trouble.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.923
He'll come back. He lives across the way.
I'll explain it to him.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.481
God knows how.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.564
Do you have another pair of trousers?

14:30.840 --> 14:32.842
Aye. In the back.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.561
Come with me?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.041
If ye dinna think it immoral.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.327
It's...

15:22.760 --> 15:25.366
It's very fine to see you again, Claire.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.411
I never thought that...

15:37.520 --> 15:38.521
Our child.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.121
Here...

15:50.360 --> 15:51.486
I thought you'd like...

15:54.800 --> 15:56.290
to see our daughter.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.921
Daughter?

16:02.080 --> 16:03.081
Our daughter?

16:06.760 --> 16:07.761
She...

16:10.880 --> 16:11.961
She knows?

16:13.120 --> 16:14.246
She does.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.441
What the devil?

16:24.800 --> 16:25.961
They're photographs.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.242
They're made with something
called a camera.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.601
It captures a person's likeness,

16:32.640 --> 16:35.644
like painting... but with light.

16:36.680 --> 16:41.402
I'm afraid if I'm to see, I'll need these.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.085
Only for reading and such.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.524
For years, I had the eyes of a hawk,

16:49.000 --> 16:50.764
but my sight is not what it once was.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.643
You look as dashing as ever.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.845
I don't look like an old man?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.560
Of course not.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.885
I know we've both...

17:05.160 --> 17:08.050
seen a few years
and all that goes with it.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.601
My hair has some grey.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.201
I dyed n.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.171
I wanted to look...

17:18.960 --> 17:21.008
Well, the same as when you last saw me.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.163
Time doesn't matter, Sassenach.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.608
You will always be beautiful to me.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.681
Now...

17:35.160 --> 17:37.686
show me my daughter.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.961
Her name.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.321
What did you name her?

18:27.800 --> 18:28.801
Brianna.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.401
Brianna.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.169
What an awful name for a wee lass.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.723
It's not an awful name.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.801
It's beautiful.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.963
I promised you I would name
our child after your father, Brian.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.687
Brianna.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.201
Beautiful.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.766
Tell me about her.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.925
What was she like as a wee lass?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.404
What did she first say
when she learned to speak?

19:03.440 --> 19:06.250
"Dog." That was her first word.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.967
- And "no" was her second one.
- Aye.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.326
They learn that one fast.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.324
She was such a tiny thing.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.044
She was such a good sleeper.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.568
She used to smile in her sleep...

19:21.560 --> 19:22.561
just like you.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.245
She has your red hair.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.281
Like her sister...

19:32.240 --> 19:33.241
Faith.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.001
YES.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.684
She was seven there.

19:48.760 --> 19:52.606
It was at the graduation.
My graduation from medical school.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.125
You're a doctor now?

19:54.480 --> 19:55.561
Surgeon.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.564
You always were one.
Now you have the title to go with it.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.291
This is her at home.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.401
And...

20:07.600 --> 20:10.046
That's her with Smoky, our dog.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.121
Dog?

20:11.200 --> 20:12.486
What sort of dog is that?

20:12.560 --> 20:13.721
Newfoundland.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.009
Splits wood, does she?

20:18.360 --> 20:21.921
Well, winters in Boston
can be as cold as Scotland,

20:22.680 --> 20:25.490
but when it's warm, she likes to swim.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.882
This is one from when we were at the coast
during the summer with her friends.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.961
Christ.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.609
Don't tell me she goes swimming in that...

20:32.680 --> 20:34.808
That rigging and with a lad?

20:37.840 --> 20:39.126
It's a bikini.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.328
All the girls wear them in 1968.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.087
If it's the bikini, I can assure you,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.648
it's actually quite modest for the time.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.845
There's something
I need to tell you, Claire.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.325
I have a son...

21:20.840 --> 21:21.841
Willie.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.566
I havena told anyone
about him, not even Jenny.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.841
It's...

21:29.320 --> 21:30.481
It's when

21:31.360 --> 21:32.407
I was in England

21:33.520 --> 21:35.284
in the service of the Dunsany family.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.841
He...

21:39.280 --> 21:41.681
I couldna say he was mine.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.041
He's a bastard.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.808
Havena seen him since he was a wee lad.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.522
I never will see him again except...

21:54.040 --> 21:55.451
perhaps in a...

21:57.720 --> 21:58.801
portrait like this.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.725
Did you love his mother?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.161
No.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.091
She died in childbirth.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.567
I am guilty of her death...

22:29.400 --> 22:30.401
before God.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.566
Perhaps more than that
because I did not love her.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.761
What's he like? Your son?

22:43.640 --> 22:44.641
He's spoiled...

22:45.640 --> 22:46.641
stubborn...

22:47.480 --> 22:48.720
ill-mannered...

22:49.440 --> 22:50.680
loud“.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.205
With a wicked temper.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.161
And braw...

22:55.840 --> 22:58.969
bonny... canty and strong.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.521
And yours.

23:04.880 --> 23:05.927
Mine.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.681
I knew...

23:09.600 --> 23:11.443
when I decided to come back...

23:12.200 --> 23:13.531
you would have had a life.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.721
Claire...

23:35.360 --> 23:38.728
did you leave Frank to come here?

23:40.160 --> 23:41.161
No.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.089
He died a few years ago.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.001
But...

23:47.800 --> 23:50.770
when you returned, he took you back?
He still loved you?

23:51.920 --> 23:52.921
YES.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.565
What did you tell him about me?

23:57.240 --> 23:58.287
Everything-

23:58.880 --> 24:01.121
Then we never spoke about it again.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.846
It was hard for him.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.482
But he loved Brianna, so we made it work.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.601
So...

24:13.560 --> 24:14.561
you were happy with him?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.880
I was happy raising Brianna with him.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.125
He was a very good father to her.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.241
Christ.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.844
The tavern. I forgot.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.246
Forgot what?

24:31.960 --> 24:34.850
I meant to be there at 1:00.
Clear right out of my head.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.645
You'll come wi' me?

24:45.280 --> 24:47.282
Wild horses wouldn't keep me away.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.483
So after Culloden, Prince Charles
spent many years a hunted man.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.528
He actually disguised himself as a woman

24:55.600 --> 24:59.082
and escaped to the Isle of Skye
until his brother came and rescued him.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.730
So he's all right, then?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.201
Present day, yes. He's alive.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.567
But he won't live a very happy life.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.081
Claire.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.725
Milady?

25:13.280 --> 25:15.203
- Fergus?
- You've returned?

25:15.840 --> 25:16.887
Fergus.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.641
It's a miracle.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.130
God has restored you.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.725
Let me look at you.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.802
You've grown into
such a handsome young man.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.968
Aye. I have.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.523
I thought I was seeing a ghost.
It is really you, then?

25:36.600 --> 25:37.647
'Tis.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.246
What happened?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.406
Lost it fighting the redcoats, milady.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.046
Aye, bravely.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.485
Where have you been all these years?
We thought you dead.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.562
After Culloden, I...

26:06.320 --> 26:07.765
I thought you were all dead.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.648
And I didn't want
to bring harm to Lallybroch,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.322
being the wife of a traitor,

26:15.360 --> 26:18.045
so I left... for America.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.609
I need to speak with you
about our friend, Mr Willoughby.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.010
Pardon us, Milady.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.205
Is Milady staying? With you?

26:47.280 --> 26:48.850
I dinna ken yet.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.801
Hope so.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.121
What about...

26:57.400 --> 26:58.401
Aye.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.088
Aye, I havena had time
to think it through.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.722
With Claire back,
I'm not sure it's even a concern.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.446
I need to consult Ned Gowan,
have him advise me on the law.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.521
Aye.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.408
Now, what's to do with Willoughby?

27:15.840 --> 27:17.490
I'm afraid he's been drinking again.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.804
- Dinna fash, lad.
- Aye.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.368
- Can I interest you in a pie?
- Thank you.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.721
Is everything all right?

27:31.680 --> 27:33.887
Aye. It's fine.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.811
An associate of ours
has got himself into some trouble.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.451
I'm late to meet someone.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.041
Because of me?

27:45.440 --> 27:46.441
No.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.686
Because of me.

27:50.040 --> 27:53.089
I hope Fergus
wasn't too shocked by my re-appearance.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.170
I didn't know what to say.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.008
You told the truth of it.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.764
You did go to America.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.765
I thought it might be wise to leave out
the whole "200 years in the future" part.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.001
A wee transgression.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.210
Where are we going now?

28:11.160 --> 28:12.571
The World's End.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.481
Give it to me!

28:21.840 --> 28:22.841
Give it...

28:25.480 --> 28:27.528
Please tell me that is not Mr Willoughby?

28:27.640 --> 28:28.971
I would, Sassenach,

28:29.040 --> 28:32.123
but I would have to lie to ye. Willoughby?

28:34.800 --> 28:36.529
What have you got yourself into?

28:37.680 --> 28:38.841
He licked my elbow!

28:39.480 --> 28:40.845
He said hejust wanted to rub it.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.763
I told him it'd cost a penny a minute.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.080
Then he just up and licked it!

28:44.600 --> 28:45.965
And without paying additionally.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.127
Your payment...

28:58.160 --> 28:59.491
in full.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.402
- Hello, I'm Claire Ran--
- Malcolm.

29:12.760 --> 29:13.761
My wife.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.321
Wife?

29:15.800 --> 29:18.485
This is Mr Willoughby, my...

29:19.720 --> 29:20.721
associate.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.567
A pleasure, Madame Malcolm.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.560
Would ye mind waiting here?

29:28.640 --> 29:32.486
I must attend to that business I spoke of.
I'll be in the back just there.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.441
Of course.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.601
I'll not be long.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.203
Sit and behave.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.280
Look after my wife.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.601
Of course.

29:48.160 --> 29:52.404
I assume Mr Willoughby
is not your real name.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.161
No.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.485
Yi Tien Cho.

29:59.480 --> 30:04.042
It means "leans against heaven."

30:05.680 --> 30:06.681
That's lovely.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.280
Why don't you use that name?

30:10.640 --> 30:15.885
Yi Tien Cho sounds very much
like a coarse Gaelic word,

30:16.360 --> 30:20.684
so your husband thought
Willoughby would do better.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.721
I see.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.285
Do you suppose I enjoy idling
in dank rooms in unsavoury establishments?

30:51.360 --> 30:53.089
I canna say what you enjoy.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.290
I should say not,
being unsavoury yourself.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.122
Seems a trifle light, Mr Malcolm.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.690
'Tis the amount we settled upon.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.285
At the outset, perhaps,

31:13.360 --> 31:16.887
but there is word you have
branched out from the High Street,

31:17.760 --> 31:20.684
as far as Arbroath and Dundee.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.722
With that comes further tax.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.803
I can assure you I only sell
the agreed amount.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.041
Forgive my impertinence, Mr Malcolm,
if I cannot rely on your word.

31:34.360 --> 31:39.082
I will expect a 25% increase
at our next meeting.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.451
And ye'll be disappointed.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.330
I only sell on the High Street.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.405
We shall see, Mr Malcolm.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.721
After that, he gave me food and work.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.162
If not for him, I could've died.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.042
Jamie is true friend. I owe him my life.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.291
We should go, Sassenach.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.847
Mr Willoughby was just telling me

32:07.920 --> 32:10.571
how he stowed away on a ship from China,

32:10.640 --> 32:14.201
and that when he got here,
he was starving and almost died...

32:15.360 --> 32:17.124
until you saved him.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.441
Aye.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.884
He's a very interesting man.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.960
Well, I hope to see you again.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.489
I would like that very much.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.727
What does that mean?

32:34.800 --> 32:36.165
Honourable wife.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.845
You speak Chinese?

32:39.960 --> 32:41.724
I manage to understand a wee bit.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.929
My pleasure, Yi Tien Cho.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.920
Monsieur Malcolm.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.681
Madame Jeanne.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.564
Monsieur Malcolm, if I might
have a word in private with you.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.642
Of course, but first,
allow me to introduce my wife.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.725
Madame Malcolm.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.851
Your... wife?

34:00.040 --> 34:01.883
Monsieur Malcolm, you bring her here?

34:03.120 --> 34:05.361
I thought, "A woman, well enough,"

34:05.480 --> 34:08.051
but to insult our own
jeunes filles is not good,

34:08.920 --> 34:10.728
but then, a wife?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.331
Bonsoir, Madame.

34:20.679 --> 34:21.726
De méme, enchantée.

34:22.760 --> 34:26.321
Is my room ready, Madame?
We shall be spending the night.

34:26.719 --> 34:27.721
Of course.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.241
Pauline?

34:29.920 --> 34:32.400
Would you fetch up
hot water and fresh linens

34:32.480 --> 34:35.210
for Monsieur Malcolm and his...

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
Wife.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.885
Right away, Madame.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.568
Merci, Madame. Bonsoir.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.761
Bonsoir.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.281
I...

35:01.240 --> 35:03.811
It's not much, but it's convenient.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.409
Take your cloak off, Sassenach.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.446
So...

35:29.720 --> 35:30.926
You live in a brothel?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.001
Aye.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.321
I'm sorry, I...

35:38.520 --> 35:40.648
knew it wasn't right
to bring you here, but...

35:41.120 --> 35:42.690
we are in need of a hot supper,

35:43.160 --> 35:46.369
and it's a good deal more comfortable
than my cot at the print shop.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.243
Perhaps it was a poor idea.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.401
We can leave if...

35:56.480 --> 35:59.927
Why... do you have a room in a brothel?

36:04.080 --> 36:07.482
Is it because you're such a good customer?

36:07.600 --> 36:08.840
Oh, no.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.684
No, I'm not a customer of Madame Jeanne.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.724
She's a customer of mine and a good one.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.009
She keeps a room for me

36:21.800 --> 36:24.690
because I'm often abroad late,
tending to business.

36:25.680 --> 36:30.288
I'd soon have a place I can come to
for food and a bed at any hour.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.961
Privacy.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.565
Sounds reasonable enough.

36:44.760 --> 36:45.761
Sassenach...

36:49.400 --> 36:50.890
why have you come back?

36:53.040 --> 36:54.883
Why do you think I've come back?

36:57.680 --> 36:58.681
I dinna ken.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.005
You're the mother of my child, and...

37:05.760 --> 37:07.842
for that alone, I owe you my soul.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.131
But have you come back to be my wife again

37:13.840 --> 37:16.605
or only to bring me word of my daughter?

37:18.920 --> 37:21.127
I came back now because...

37:22.400 --> 37:23.447
before, I...

37:25.280 --> 37:26.486
I thought you were dead.

37:29.720 --> 37:30.801
I meant to die.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.687
Tried hard enough.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.326
How did you find out...

37:44.440 --> 37:46.681
I hadna died or where I was?

37:48.920 --> 37:50.524
I had some help.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.250
A young historian.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.085
He tracked you down to Edinburgh,
and when I saw...

37:56.680 --> 37:58.011
"A. Malcolm," I...

37:59.920 --> 38:01.046
thought it might be you.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.085
So I took a chance.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.086
Then ye came back?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.166
But Still...

38:18.080 --> 38:19.081
why?

38:21.920 --> 38:23.649
Are you trying to tell me something?

38:26.320 --> 38:27.446
Because if so, I...

38:28.720 --> 38:32.520
I know you have a life now,

38:32.960 --> 38:35.406
and perhaps there are other ties or--

38:35.480 --> 38:38.131
I have burned for you
for so long, do ye not know that?

38:41.160 --> 38:43.083
But I am no longer the man you once knew.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.401
You and I,

38:46.640 --> 38:49.291
we know each other less
than we did when we were first wed.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.811
Do you want me to go?

38:58.200 --> 38:59.611
No, I don't want you to go.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.611
But I must know...

39:07.440 --> 39:09.363
do you want me?

39:14.760 --> 39:17.047
Whoever you are, James Fraser...

39:18.440 --> 39:19.441
Yes...

39:20.760 --> 39:22.330
I do want you.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.326
What about you?

39:30.800 --> 39:33.041
How do you know what I'm like now?

39:35.040 --> 39:37.407
I could be a horrible person
for all you know.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.524
I suppose ye might be, at that.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.811
But do ye know, Sassenach,

39:48.360 --> 39:49.725
I dinna think I care.

39:52.760 --> 39:53.886
Neither do I.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.451
Dinner, Mr Malcolm.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.241
Good evening to you.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.010
Thank you kindly, Pauline.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.851
We ate slowly,

40:37.160 --> 40:40.323
savouring each other
as much as the meal before us.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.250
We began reminiscing about our life
together those many years ago,

40:48.560 --> 40:52.007
then carefully filling in details
of our lime apart.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.688
We began to know each other again...

40:58.920 --> 41:00.888
and discover whether we were, in fact,

41:00.960 --> 41:03.611
the same two
who had once existed as one...

41:04.800 --> 41:06.609
And whether we might be one again.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.525
After we finished,

41:12.600 --> 41:15.729
<i>the same thought
was uppermost in both our minds.</i>

41:16.400 --> 41:18.607
It could scarcely be othenwise.

41:24.800 --> 41:25.801
Will ye...

41:28.720 --> 41:30.131
Will ye come to bed with me, then?

41:33.200 --> 41:34.247
Yes.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.006
Where are the laces?

44:54.080 --> 44:55.081
It's a zipper.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.086
You just pull the tab straight down.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.169
You bloody well say something?

45:59.120 --> 46:00.246
Christ.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.281
Claire...

46:05.160 --> 46:07.367
you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.963
You must really be losing your eyesight.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.971
I want to see you.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.051
Are you as scared as I am?

46:46.480 --> 46:48.244
I suppose I must be afraid, aye?

46:53.200 --> 46:54.281
Do you remember...

46:55.360 --> 46:56.691
on our wedding night...

46:59.200 --> 47:00.440
we were both scared.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.645
You held my hands.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.442
And told me it would be
easier if we touched.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.086
Aye, when we were wed,

47:12.360 --> 47:14.283
I saw ye standing there...

47:17.560 --> 47:21.087
so... bonny in your white shift.

47:22.920 --> 47:24.445
I couldna think of anything, but...

47:25.240 --> 47:28.130
when I could have you alone,
naked, next to me.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.926
Do you want me now?

47:30.000 --> 47:31.570
Oh, God, yes.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.805
I'm sorry. Have I hurt ye, Claire?

47:47.880 --> 47:49.882
I think I've broken my nose.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.841
No, ye haven't.

47:54.800 --> 47:55.847
When ye break your nose,

47:55.920 --> 47:58.127
it makes a nasty crunching sound
and you bleed like a pig.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.926
It's all right.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.681
Sorry.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.166
Do it now.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.721
And don't be gentle.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.450
Give me your mouth, Sassenach.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.842
Oh, God. Claire.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.601
Claire.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.566
Your breasts are...

50:41.960 --> 50:43.291
like ivory.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.121
Christ...

50:49.600 --> 50:51.284
to touch you, Sassenach...

50:54.800 --> 50:57.963
You with your skin like...

50:59.720 --> 51:03.725
white velvet and the sweet
long lines of your body.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.121
God.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.490
I couldna look at ye

51:08.280 --> 51:10.203
and keep my hands from you nor...

51:11.040 --> 51:13.042
be near you and not want ye.

51:20.120 --> 51:24.011
Is that how you felt
the first time we lay together?

51:25.720 --> 51:28.087
It's always been
forever for me, Sassenach.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.687
It's like riding a bicycle, I suppose.

51:47.280 --> 51:50.602
Did you know that you
have more hairs on your chest

51:51.440 --> 51:52.521
than you used to?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.001
Well...

51:55.240 --> 51:56.651
I dinna usually count them.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.284
What is a bicycle?

52:04.240 --> 52:05.526
I just mean...

52:05.640 --> 52:08.291
Well, we seemed to remember
what to do all right.

52:09.600 --> 52:11.568
Did you think we could forget, Sassenach?

52:12.960 --> 52:15.088
I may be lacking in practice, but...

52:15.800 --> 52:17.962
I havena lost all my faculties yet.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.684
I should have taken ye to a tavern.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.801
It's all right.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.728
Although I must say,

52:33.240 --> 52:36.050
of all the places
I imagined being with you again,

52:36.360 --> 52:37.964
I never thought of a brothel.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.444
I'm not a saint, Sassenach, but...

52:42.240 --> 52:43.810
I'm not a pimp either.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.207
Good to hear.

52:47.880 --> 52:51.248
So, do you want to tell me
what it is that you do,

52:51.760 --> 52:54.161
or shall I just run down the list

52:54.240 --> 52:57.528
of disreputable possibilities
until I come close?

52:59.720 --> 53:01.131
What's your best guess?

53:05.520 --> 53:06.521
Well...

53:09.520 --> 53:11.045
you're not just a printer.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.441
Why not?

53:12.960 --> 53:14.291
Because you're far too fit.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.450
Most men in their 40s

53:16.880 --> 53:18.848
have started
to go soft around the middle...

53:20.160 --> 53:21.924
But you haven't a spare ounce on you.

53:23.520 --> 53:26.091
Well, that's mostly because
I don't have anyone to cook for me.

53:27.280 --> 53:30.124
If you ate in taverns all the time,
you wouldn't be fat either.

53:32.120 --> 53:35.841
Luckily, it looks like you eat regularly.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.802
Don't try and distract me.

53:43.240 --> 53:46.722
You don't get muscles like that
slaving over a printing press.

53:47.880 --> 53:49.405
Have you ever worked one, Sassenach?

53:50.360 --> 53:51.361
No.

53:55.480 --> 53:56.970
I don't suppose...

53:58.800 --> 54:01.246
you've taken up highway robbery?

54:03.600 --> 54:04.601
Guess again.

54:11.800 --> 54:13.370
Kidnapping for ransom.

54:14.520 --> 54:15.681
Petty thievery?

54:17.920 --> 54:19.729
It can't be piracy,

54:19.800 --> 54:21.962
not unless
you've gotten over being seasick.

54:25.640 --> 54:29.008
You were a traitor
the last time I knew you, but...

54:29.480 --> 54:33.405
that doesn't seem like
a very profitable way to make a living.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.801
I'm still a traitor...

54:36.680 --> 54:40.321
though I havena been convicted. Lately.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.401
Lately?

54:44.560 --> 54:49.043
I spent several years
in prison for treason...

54:50.680 --> 54:51.681
for The Rising.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.802
But that was sometime back.

54:57.960 --> 54:58.961
I knew that.

55:00.840 --> 55:01.841
And a bit more.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.805
So, what is it
that you do for a living these days?

55:14.520 --> 55:15.601
I am...

55:17.320 --> 55:18.367
a printer.

55:20.640 --> 55:21.766
And a traitor?

55:23.040 --> 55:26.044
I have fought
with sword and dirk many times.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.570
The English took them away.

55:29.760 --> 55:33.287
The press was a weapon
into my hands again.

55:38.040 --> 55:42.648
I've been arrested for sedition
six times in the past two years...

55:45.840 --> 55:46.921
and...

55:47.520 --> 55:49.761
had my premises seized...

55:50.120 --> 55:51.167
twice...

55:52.160 --> 55:55.687
Though the court
wasn't able to prove anything.

55:58.560 --> 56:02.007
So what happens to you when
they do prove it one of these days?

56:03.120 --> 56:04.201
Likely hanging.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.770
That's a relief.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.720
I did warn ye.

56:12.960 --> 56:13.961
You did.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.041
Do ye want to leave now?

56:22.720 --> 56:25.883
I did not come here
to make love to you once.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.169
I came back to be with you.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.571
I canna tell ye...

56:41.200 --> 56:44.283
what it felt like
when I touched ye today...

56:46.560 --> 56:48.005
and knew you to be real.

56:54.400 --> 56:55.970
To find you again...

56:58.600 --> 56:59.647
and to lose you...

57:02.760 --> 57:04.205
You won't lose me...

57:11.800 --> 57:14.770
not unless you do something immoral.

57:21.800 --> 57:22.801
What is it?

57:23.600 --> 57:24.601
It's just...

57:26.880 --> 57:31.124
ls there something else
you haven't told me?

57:34.600 --> 57:35.601
Well...

57:36.480 --> 57:40.246
printing seditious pamphlets
isn't all that profitable.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.284
I wouldn't think so.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.809
So what else have you been doing?

57:49.920 --> 57:51.570
A wee bit of smuggling on the side.

57:52.520 --> 57:54.170
Smuggling what?

57:54.280 --> 57:57.841
Whiskey mostly, and cognac, brandy...

57:58.960 --> 58:01.281
some rum now and then,
and a wee bit of French wine.

58:03.920 --> 58:06.127
So that's what you meant...

58:07.520 --> 58:09.602
by Madame Jeanne being a customer?

58:09.680 --> 58:10.966
Aye, it works very well.

58:11.280 --> 58:15.763
We store the liquor in a cellar below
when it comes in from France.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.330
Some we sell to Madame Jeanne directly

58:18.400 --> 58:20.084
and some she keeps for us

58:20.160 --> 58:21.844
until we can ship it on.

58:25.680 --> 58:26.761
And...

58:27.320 --> 58:30.164
And as pan of those arrangements, you...

58:32.880 --> 58:35.611
The answer
to what you're thinking, Sassenach...

58:36.920 --> 58:37.967
is no.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.330
Mind reader, are you?

58:40.400 --> 58:44.803
You're thinking
do I take out my price in trade, aye?

58:45.880 --> 58:48.087
Not that that's any of my business.

58:49.400 --> 58:50.481
Isn't it, then?

58:52.560 --> 58:53.561
Is it?

58:53.960 --> 58:55.041
Aye.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.363
And you don't... With Madame Jeanne?

59:07.960 --> 59:09.007
I don't.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.201
How?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.001
Culloden.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.442
I will never leave you again.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.525
Ye were right to leave.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.451
Ye did it for Brianna.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.768
Ye were a wonderful mother, Claire.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.721
I know it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.843
Ye gave me a child, Claire.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.650
She is alive and safe.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.481
Because of her...

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.330
we will live forever...

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.961
you and I.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.883
I wanted to see if you were really here.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.730
Maybe I'm a ghost.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.409
I could watch you for hours, Sassenach.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.921
See how you've changed...

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.720
How you're the same.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.361
Your hair...

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.448
Do you recall?

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.125
My brown-haired lass.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.361
Well, yes.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.167
A long time ago,
you asked me what it was between us.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.367
I remember.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.610
What it is when I touch you
and you lie with me.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.685
I said I didn't know.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.331
I dinna ken either.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.285
I still don't.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.684
Well, it's still there.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.081
Aye?

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.046
I never thought I'd laugh
in a woman's bed again, Sassenach,

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.570
or even come to one,
save as a brute blind with need.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.080
Is that what you did
when you had the need?

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.561
Claire, I...

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.721
I...

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.406
We don't have to rush it.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.801
Are you sure?

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.730
I only have one question.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.490
Did you ever
fall in love with anyone else...

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.360
after I left?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.441
No.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.686
No, Sassenach.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.971
I never loved anyone but you.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.210
Breakfast, Mr Malcolm.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.885
Come back later, if you will.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.726
Don't you want to eat?

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.921
Aye.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.326
Where are you going?

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.726
Go back to sleep, Sassenach.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.762
I have to take care of some business.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.526
I dinna want to leave ye,

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.521
but I must.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.161
Just to remind you...

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.366
You're Mrs Malcolm here in Edinburgh.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.850
Not Fraser.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.601
Understood.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.329
You'll stay here till I return?

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.526
I'm not likely to go anywhere.
My legs are like Jell-0.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.246
Jell-O?

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.685
Hurry back, soldier.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.641
Jamie?

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.681
Sorry, mistress.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.008
Are you Mr Malcolm's woman?

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.206
I suppose I am. Who are you?

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.881
Ian Murray, mistress.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.084
I'm looking for Mr Malcolm.
But I best be on my way.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.521
Wait, hold on. Come in.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.401
Did you say Murray?

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.571
Are you Jenny and Ian Murray's son?

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.081
Aye.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.961
How'd you know?

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.281
I knew your parents a very long time ago.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.566
Your uncle and I--

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.241
How old are you?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.047
I'm 16.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.484
And dinna worry, I'm old enough to know
what sort of a place this is,

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.250
meaning no offense to you,
of course, mistress.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.287
There's none taken.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.731
Very nice to meet you, Ian.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.243
lam,well...

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.488
I'm your aunt, Claire.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.720
But...

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:23.401
you're dead.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:26.526
Not yet.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.281
You know,
some of the old women at Lallybroch

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:33.408
used to say you were
a wise woman, a white lady.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.930
Or maybe even a fairy.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.127
They say as how, when Uncle Jamie
came home from Culloden without you,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.167
that maybe ye'd gone back
to where ye came from...

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.241
Back to the fairies.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.089
Is that true? Do you live in a dun?

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680
No.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.129
I was in the Colonies.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.330
I went there after I thought
Jamie had died at Culloden.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.691
So you've come back to him?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520
I have.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.640
Well,

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.439
very pleased to meet you,
Uncle Jamie's wife.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.890
When ye see him,
will ye tell him I'm looking for him?

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.640
I will.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.441
Dinna be shy. Sit and join us.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:50.281
Thank you.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.406
You're the new lass?

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.720
Wee bit older
than Madame usually takes on.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.765
She likes them no more than five and 20,
but I'm sure you'll do fine.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.682
She's got good skin and nice bubbies.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.081
Here's us going on.
What's your name, dearie?

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.681
Claire.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.331
Well, I'm Dorcas.
And that's Peggy and Molly.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.921
Hello.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.046
You looked famished.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.723
Eat something, then we can get to know ye.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.081
Thank you.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.446
Had a rough one for yer first, aye?

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.330
- I'm not--
- Your neck.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.521
It's red.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.923
And by the manner ye walked in here,
a bit sore between the legs as well?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.690
Look, she's blushing.
You are a fresh one, aren't you?

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.361
Never mind.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.369
After breakfast,
I'll show you where the tubs are,

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.569
and you can soak your parts in warm water.
Be good as new for tonight.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.324
Make sure ye show her
the jars of sweet herbs.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.170
Put them in the water.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.720
Madame Jeanne likes us to smell sweet.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.447
And a warm bath after
helps stop a bairn from coming.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.889
Actually, mugwort is very effective
in stopping pregnancy.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.245
If there's one thing we ken, dearie,

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.209
it's how to steer clear of a kitling.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.086
The girls use a bit of sponge
dipped in vinegar

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.491
or a wee bit o' wine in a pinch.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.010
You stick that way up ye nether mouth,
ye'll nae get a squeaker.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.846
An early customer.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.290
I hate it when they come during breakfast.
Ye canna digest yer food properly.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.010
Well, ye needn't worry, Molly.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.286
Claire'll have to take him.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.760
Newest girl takes the ones no one wants.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.126
Put your finger up his bum.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.201
That'll get him off faster than anything.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.285
I'll save a bannock for ye.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.326
Thank you.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.730
Madame, what are you doing here?

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.286
Eating.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.408
Did no one bring you food this morning?

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.165
Well, no...

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.287
Merde.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.171
I'm so sorry.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.850
I will have that worthless maid
flayed for this.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.321
It's quite all right.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.368
I was actually having
a lovely chat with the ladies.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.321
If you please.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.286
I will have the rest
of your meal sent up to you.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.130
It's all right. I've had enough.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.006
It's nice to meet you all.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.886
And thanks for the tip.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.401
Who the hell are you?

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.447
None of your concern.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.801
You need to leave.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.530
No whore tells me what to do.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.929
Now, when I'm finished
looking for what I'm looking for,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.571
you can earn some coin. Wait on the bed.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.408
I think you're mistaken.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.083
I don't work here.
This is my husband's room.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.607
Husband?

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.321
Is that so?

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.888
Then you can tell me
where he keeps his ledgers.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.166
I have no idea.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.208
Maybe if I fuck you,
it'll jar your memory.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.921
Just get out!
