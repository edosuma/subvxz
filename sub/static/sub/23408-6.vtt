WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:07.640
We have a spy
inside the Cantii citadel.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.320
This spy tells me
Kerra came to see you.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.640
What deal did you make with her?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.640
Lokka himself is here.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.360
So why did
the Druids cast you out?

00:17.400 --> 00:19.840
Because
I was possessed by Pwykka.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.400
He's one of the three
Demon Kings.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.800
So he's still
inside you?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.600
Pwykka's been asleep
for a year now,

00:24.640 --> 00:25.800
but with all these rumblings,

00:25.840 --> 00:27.200
I feel him.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.280
If Lokka is here,
Pwykka won't be far behind.

00:30.320 --> 00:35.160
Veran took the Roman General
to the Underworld.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.440
Follow his footsteps.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.880
Only then will you know
what it is he seeks,

00:38.920 --> 00:40.560
and what might save us.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:37.000 --> 01:38.640
It's you.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.440
You will defeat them.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.080
I must hurry.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.200
Pwykka!

04:26.720 --> 04:28.560
Go on, see
what's happening.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.000
I pledge eternal loyalty,
my queen.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.800
May the gods protect you.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.200
Lindon of the Gaul,

05:31.240 --> 05:32.160
come forward.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.320
You have proved yourself
a noble warrior

05:36.360 --> 05:37.960
in the service
of my father.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.400
If you agree,

05:39.440 --> 05:44.080
I would have you serve
as General of all our forces.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.360
Help me.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
May the gods protect you.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.640
My queen.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.040
I pledge my undying loyalty.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.800
May the gods protect you.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.240
-Thank you.
-Next.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.040
Two, please.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.040
Two.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.040
There you are.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.160
Thank you.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.320
There we go.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.080
Thank you.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.240
So..?

07:16.280 --> 07:17.440
Come on,

07:17.480 --> 07:18.520
paint me a picture.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.040
Tall.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.080
Pale skin.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.960
Long hair...

07:25.000 --> 07:26.160
like a proper queen.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.880
Does she look wise?

07:27.920 --> 07:28.880
Very.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.160
She's going to need to be.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.960
What colour hair?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.640
Red, like fire.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.720
I knew it.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.040
Your mother
had red hair.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.640
Islene had
a touch of it, too.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.960
The gods only give their fire
to their favourites.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.240
Only for
the special ones.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.360
It doesn't
make sense.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.840
What doesn't?

07:46.880 --> 07:48.680
When I was out there
on the rocks,

07:48.720 --> 07:49.880
day after day,

07:49.920 --> 07:51.840
dragging wet salt
up that hill,

07:51.880 --> 07:53.680
one thing kept me going,

07:53.720 --> 07:57.000
that I was raising
someone special,

07:57.040 --> 07:58.240
that the gods
gave me Islene

07:58.280 --> 08:00.960
to raise for them
for a special purpose,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.720
and I'd better not mess it up.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.240
So why did
the gods punish me?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.720
Your brother
spoke to the Roman,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.280
then freed the girl
and they left together.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.320
Whatever you're thinking
right now, it's wrong.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.960
Your brother
is now your enemy.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.520
There's is no love
left between you.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.640
Phelan would never
betray his tribe.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.840
Summon the Roman.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.280
My brother
came to see you.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.200
What did he say?

08:42.240 --> 08:43.960
What did he want to know?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.720
Your father
asked me questions, too.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.640
Where did that get him?

08:54.040 --> 08:56.080
Rome kept its word.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.040
You're free to go.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.640
But with this message.

08:58.680 --> 09:02.160
Tell your General
that I will speak with him.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.080
But he comes here,

09:04.120 --> 09:05.320
to me.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.040
I'll pass your message on.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.360
I think he's going
to like it here.

09:13.400 --> 09:17.080
After all,
it is a fine fortress.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.440
What are you
doing in here?

09:25.480 --> 09:26.920
The queen demands
that we remain together,

09:26.960 --> 09:29.840
for the stability
of the tribe.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.080
Then we must do
as the queen demands.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.680
I'll find
somewhere else to stay.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.840
If we're going to pretend,

09:36.880 --> 09:38.800
we might as well
make it convincing,

09:38.840 --> 09:40.320
for the good of the tribe,
and all.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.480
I don't hate you, Amena.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.040
In fact,
I feel sorry for you.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.400
Thank you, Lindon,

09:49.440 --> 09:51.000
but there's really no need.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.080
I've always been
very resourceful in adversity.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.400
Your hands protect me

10:22.440 --> 10:24.280
from Dark Moon to Dark Moon...

10:24.320 --> 10:27.080
Your sword covers me
from Dark Moon to Dark Moon.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.000
Your care shelters me

10:29.040 --> 10:30.280
from Dark Moon to Dark Moon.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.720
All love and honour

10:32.760 --> 10:34.600
to the Dark Mother Nehellania.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.760
She shall be blinded
by the fear...

10:38.800 --> 10:40.160
Blinded by the pain.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.240
Bound by me, cursed by me...

10:43.280 --> 10:46.920
Dark Mother, send me a demon
to do my will...

11:08.520 --> 11:09.480
Praefectus.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.920
That night
the prisoner escaped,

11:10.960 --> 11:12.040
you were in the sickbay,

11:12.080 --> 11:13.800
had a clear view
of where he was tied up.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.600
That's right, Praefectus.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.000
Did you see
anything?

11:18.040 --> 11:19.000
What like?

11:19.040 --> 11:21.920
Like a blind man
freeing himself

11:21.960 --> 11:24.280
and escaping from
a heavily-armed camp?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.320
There was something...

11:27.120 --> 11:28.560
What?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.280
A small girl.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.240
Pale.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.280
Mousey hair.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.840
She called him "father".

11:36.400 --> 11:37.760
She freed him.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.880
And you didn't think
to mention this before?

12:03.360 --> 12:06.480
Shit, shit, shit!

12:11.880 --> 12:13.440
Get up.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.560
Get on your feet.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.360
We're getting out of here.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.600
Move.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.480
She wants to talk.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.720
Not in the field,

12:28.760 --> 12:29.920
in her fortress.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.080
Then talk we shall.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.360
What, so we just
let this pass?

12:33.400 --> 12:35.480
Roll over,
let her tickle your tummy.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.040
We're dealing with
a new regime now.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.160
What do you think, Vitus?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.680
Do you think we can
persuade the new queen

12:40.720 --> 12:44.320
of a golden future
inside the Empire?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.160
She's not like her father,
is she?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.680
I mean, why waste
Roman lives

12:48.720 --> 12:49.800
on the battlefield

12:49.840 --> 12:51.320
when common sense can win?

12:52.960 --> 12:54.480
No skin off my nose.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.280
That's the spirit.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.560
Vitus, the day of the ambush,

13:04.600 --> 13:06.560
we've a legionary here
who was with you,

13:06.600 --> 13:10.360
claims Vespasian
sent him back here.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.680
Is that his story?

13:12.960 --> 13:15.480
Oh, dear.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.120
Assemble
an advance party.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.600
We'll march
to Crugdunon

13:19.640 --> 13:21.240
and parlay
with Queen Kerra.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.920
Before I forget,

13:22.960 --> 13:24.360
the blind prisoner.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.240
Laughing Boy says
he knows how he escaped.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.720
Oh? How?

13:27.760 --> 13:28.880
A little girl.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.160
His daughter.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.920
She broke into camp
and freed him.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.480
What?

13:36.520 --> 13:37.840
A little girl?

13:37.880 --> 13:40.480
He's a bullshitter.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.440
I swear,
when I find him,

13:48.480 --> 13:49.880
I will fucking kill him!

13:49.920 --> 13:51.440
Did he say
what she looked like?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.000
Small, pale,

13:53.040 --> 13:54.000
dark cloak,

13:54.040 --> 13:55.320
mousey hair.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.840
She called him "father."

13:56.880 --> 13:57.880
Oh, he saw this happen?

13:57.920 --> 13:58.880
I told you,

13:58.920 --> 14:00.360
he's a bullshitter.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.640
But I know this much,

14:01.680 --> 14:03.480
someone freed that Cantii.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.720
I fed his fucking eyeballs
to the crows.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.400
A blind man...

14:13.840 --> 14:16.120
A blind father.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.160
Right...

14:22.200 --> 14:23.000
Where are you?

14:23.040 --> 14:24.280
Over here.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.200
Whoever has the stick,

14:25.240 --> 14:27.400
make a noise before I toss this.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.600
What kind of noise?

14:28.640 --> 14:29.800
Like a pig.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.640
Squeal like a pig,

14:30.680 --> 14:32.200
give me something to aim at.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.120
What happened?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.800
Too high, Dad!

14:40.840 --> 14:42.560
Sounded like a very tall pig.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.120
All right, let's try again.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.600
Again?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.440
Where'd it go?

14:52.360 --> 14:53.480
Ow!

14:55.200 --> 14:57.560
Looking for this?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.760
Your queen speaks to you.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.120
What's your name?

15:06.160 --> 15:08.640
I don't have a name.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.320
Don't be scared.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.640
I gave it away
at the Solstice.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.840
The Romans attacked
before I had my new name.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.880
Come with me.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.880
Follow me.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.960
Come.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.040
Come.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.680
My mother made this.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.360
I wore it the day
after my solstice.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.400
My first day as a woman.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.240
It's beautiful.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.440
Try it.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.280
I can't take this.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.040
It's yours.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.560
It's for somebody important.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.320
Well, soon be covered in mud, if
you're anything like me.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.040
Do you have
family here?

16:28.080 --> 16:30.440
Just me and Dad.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.200
Islene was killed by a Roman.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.920
Islene?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.400
My big sister.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.160
I'll see her again when I die.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.080
Dad said there's a place
for the ones the gods love most.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.920
It sounds like your father
misses her very much.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.120
He does.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.200
She was special.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.880
Well, that can't be easy
for you.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.080
How do you mean?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.360
Well, sometimes,

17:01.400 --> 17:03.840
fathers, they decide
who their children are,

17:03.880 --> 17:05.079
for their own reasons.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.160
It doesn't mean it's true.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.240
Islene was special.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.560
What do you think?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.880
Is that me?

17:32.920 --> 17:36.040
That's you.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.120
I'm back!

17:53.160 --> 17:55.120
Ah, we were worried.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.720
Where are you?

17:59.720 --> 18:02.800
That's my girl.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.880
Afternoon.

18:36.920 --> 18:37.880
Lovely day.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.680
Aren't they all?

18:39.720 --> 18:41.440
You look well.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.840
Have you put on
a bit of weight?

18:43.640 --> 18:45.880
I take it
they've met before?

18:45.920 --> 18:47.800
Apparently, yes.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.360
I thought so.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.880
I need to thank you,

18:53.920 --> 18:56.840
for sticking to your part
of the bargain.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.080
Was there one?

18:58.120 --> 19:00.440
Well, Pellenor's dead,
Kerra's queen.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.840
And the sky is blue,

19:01.880 --> 19:03.120
thank the gods.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.000
Why don't you
thank them for me?

19:10.720 --> 19:13.160
You were followed.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.520
On your journey.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.600
Or did you think you
were alone down there?

19:22.640 --> 19:25.720
That it was
just for you?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.160
And how do you know,
were you there, too?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.800
You were careless, Rome.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.640
Or perhaps too eager.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.120
Either way,
someone else was there,

19:36.160 --> 19:38.000
saw what you saw,

19:38.040 --> 19:39.440
knows what you know.

19:42.680 --> 19:43.880
Don't you want to know his name?

19:43.920 --> 19:45.640
I know his fucking name.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.640
Of course.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.800
You've met before.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.240
You've been most accommodating.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.560
Very helpful.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.520
But from now on, let's say
we strike another deal.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.920
And what's that?

20:01.960 --> 20:04.680
You keep away from me,
and I'll keep away from you.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.760
You stay away
from the Citadel.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.360
You have no power there.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.640
Not anymore.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.360
Are you threatening the Druids?

20:13.120 --> 20:14.760
I'm warning you.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.840
You remind me of someone,

20:20.880 --> 20:22.840
someone I met a long time ago.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.120
And who's that?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.600
Julius Caesar.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.720
What happened to him?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.920
Do we have a deal?

20:33.960 --> 20:35.560
The gods
don't deal, Rome.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.880
The gods don't deal.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.640
Is he ready?

20:58.280 --> 20:59.280
Nearly.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.880
Very nearly.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.760
Who's your skinny friend?

21:06.920 --> 21:08.480
He's no friend of mine.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.680
Forward!

22:41.160 --> 22:42.600
Halt!

22:47.440 --> 22:49.440
Help me, please...

22:55.400 --> 22:58.360
Help me, please...

23:07.520 --> 23:09.520
It's all right.

23:10.520 --> 23:14.120
Who did this to you?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.600
His name...

23:17.480 --> 23:19.200
is...

23:19.240 --> 23:20.280
Pwykka.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.520
Forward!

24:02.120 --> 24:03.680
You're late.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.360
Yeah, sorry about that.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.520
Where's my present?

24:08.560 --> 24:09.800
Present?

24:09.840 --> 24:11.280
The Druid's head--

24:11.320 --> 24:12.560
--On a stick.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.600
Yes, I'm working on it.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.280
How many?

24:22.320 --> 24:23.440
5,000.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.880
They're all standing by
across the river.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.440
I can muster twice that
by the next moon.

24:27.480 --> 24:31.560
My warriors are drawing lots
to cut the copperknob's throat.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.360
They'll have to wait
in line behind me.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.840
I'd like you
to stand your army down,

24:36.880 --> 24:41.400
until I've spoken
to the new queen.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.360
You'll all die in this field
before that happens.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.080
It will take four days
to march three legions here.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.840
Tell me,
how will your 5,000,

24:49.880 --> 24:50.880
10,000 warriors fare

24:50.920 --> 24:54.160
against 20,000 of us.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.720
Like it red then, do you?

24:59.760 --> 25:02.080
Do you want to bed her
before she dies?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.480
Stand your army down

25:05.520 --> 25:07.480
until I give the order
to attack.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.600
You'll have to kiss
more than my foot

25:12.640 --> 25:14.080
to sell that one to me.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.120
Once the Citadel has fallen,

25:16.160 --> 25:18.680
the emperor
will recognize you as queen

25:18.720 --> 25:20.720
of all the Cantii lands.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.320
Does that hit the spot?

25:24.280 --> 25:25.600
One day,

25:25.640 --> 25:27.440
and it will be sooner
than you wish,

25:27.480 --> 25:33.720
you Romans will be no more than
songs and ruins in our land.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.640
We don't want you.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.880
We don't need you.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.120
That is how the story ends.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.360
But until then,

25:46.400 --> 25:49.120
you will stand down your army?

25:59.040 --> 26:00.280
Until dawn.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.400
Then you can lick my crack.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.760
Get in my way,
and we'll kill you all.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.400
Is anybody there?

27:35.360 --> 27:36.520
Amena...

27:39.200 --> 27:40.160
Are you my demon?

27:42.040 --> 27:43.400
I beg your pardon?

27:43.440 --> 27:44.400
Amena...

27:44.440 --> 27:45.520
Who is this?

27:45.560 --> 27:46.400
Don't speak with her.
She's an imposter.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.760
Amena, that's enough.

27:47.800 --> 27:48.840
It's me you should speak to.
I'll do what you want--

27:48.880 --> 27:50.240
-Guard.
-Anything you ask.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.240
Anything.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.280
This way.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.320
Sorry for your loss.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.560
We Romans have no truck
with sacrifice.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.720
It's abhorrent to us.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.840
Are the consequences
less abhorrent?

28:39.880 --> 28:41.840
A new queen means new times.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.840
A new way
of doing business.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.960
A new future.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.880
I presume that's why
you've asked me here,

28:48.920 --> 28:50.720
to talk about the future.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.240
Who's that?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.080
Who are you?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.200
Where are you going?

29:30.880 --> 29:32.600
To the Citadel.

29:32.640 --> 29:36.600
I've come to send her
to the underworld.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.960
Then it's you.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.360
Can you take me
to her?

29:47.440 --> 29:49.800
Can you get me inside?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.240
When we show up

29:55.280 --> 29:57.080
with our ships,
and troops, and camps,

29:57.120 --> 29:58.080
it can look, um--

29:58.120 --> 29:59.600
Bad?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.920
Misleading.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.800
It's not
what the Empire's about.

30:06.840 --> 30:07.760
Oh?

30:07.800 --> 30:08.880
What is it about?

30:08.920 --> 30:10.360
One thing.

30:11.640 --> 30:12.840
Taxes.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.760
Reasonably levied,
efficiently collected,

30:14.800 --> 30:15.760
funneled back to Rome,

30:15.800 --> 30:17.400
that's it.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.880
That and a few million slaves.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.640
War is the enemy
of the tax collector.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.880
That's why we like to get
to the peace part

30:24.920 --> 30:27.120
as quickly
as possible.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.400
Which is where
your fortress comes in.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.000
Roman soldiers
stationed here

30:30.040 --> 30:31.520
with your permission

30:31.560 --> 30:32.800
could keep the peace
for a hundred years.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.920
Maybe even a thousand,

30:33.960 --> 30:35.800
and that's a lot of...

30:35.840 --> 30:37.440
peace.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.720
And a lot of taxes.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.000
You get the idea.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.800
And the safety of my tribe
can be guaranteed?

30:45.880 --> 30:46.800
That's the deal.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.360
So you're here to help.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.160
I think I've made that clear.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.080
So, why are you lying to me?

30:53.960 --> 30:55.760
I don't understand.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.920
You made a deal
with the Druids,

30:57.960 --> 30:59.640
and you made deal with my enemy.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.360
Antedia's army is standing by
if this doesn't work out.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.560
Do you deny any of that?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.720
And you want me to trust you?

31:14.360 --> 31:15.680
May I be frank?

31:17.520 --> 31:21.040
I don't know my fucking Cantiis
from my Regnis,

31:21.080 --> 31:24.280
and I genuinely don't care.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.200
We both want
the same thing,

31:26.240 --> 31:28.720
the safety and security
of these lands,

31:28.760 --> 31:29.880
and these people.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.440
Or do you trust
your Druids with that?

31:35.720 --> 31:38.280
We're the future, you and I.

31:39.960 --> 31:40.840
Chaos,

31:40.880 --> 31:43.840
sacrifice...

31:43.880 --> 31:45.000
that's the past.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.320
That's quite a trick
they have...

31:58.600 --> 32:00.840
...to know your story
before you've lived it.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.120
Do you believe it?

32:08.880 --> 32:10.560
I will be my own queen.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.400
So, we have a deal?

32:14.440 --> 32:17.080
I will retain control
of my warriors.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.120
Your soldiers will
protect my borders,

32:19.160 --> 32:22.160
and no Cantii will ever
be a slave to a Roman.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.120
If the agreement holds
in five years,

32:24.160 --> 32:26.640
we can talk about taxes.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.040
Agreed.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.720
What else?

32:29.760 --> 32:31.280
I need to speak
with my elders.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.120
You'll have your answer
by dawn.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.160
The Empire is cemented
by many things,

32:38.200 --> 32:40.240
not just war.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.760
If things go
the right way,

32:42.800 --> 32:45.920
I'd like us to become...

32:45.960 --> 32:47.400
much closer.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.080
I left my last suitor

32:52.120 --> 32:54.560
scrabbling on the floor
for his balls.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.960
Well, I've never shirked
a challenge,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.040
but if it comes to that,

32:59.080 --> 33:00.920
just give me a few yards
head start.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.520
I made you smile.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.560
You should do that
more often.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.200
What do the Druids
say about me?

33:21.240 --> 33:23.160
That Rome is a demon.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.240
What do you think?

33:26.760 --> 33:29.320
I suppose I'll find out.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.320
Oh, one last thing.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.240
You've lots of people here
looking for safety.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.480
lost their family,
lost their homes,

33:45.520 --> 33:47.160
it's most unfortunate.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.280
We came across a couple,

33:48.320 --> 33:50.160
a young girl and a blind man.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.600
We think it's his daughter.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.680
Have you seen them?

33:54.480 --> 33:56.320
What interest
do you have in them?

33:56.360 --> 33:59.280
Are they here?
I'd like to meet them.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.040
There is no one
of that description here, no.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.920
Well, if you see them,
I'd very much like to know.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.800
By dawn then.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.960
It's been a pleasure.

35:11.640 --> 35:16.760
Anyone
can make birds disappear.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.840
Even your fat, old dad
can do that.

35:18.880 --> 35:21.600
The trick is...

35:21.640 --> 35:24.120
making them come back,

35:24.160 --> 35:25.360
right...

35:26.760 --> 35:27.880
on...

35:30.160 --> 35:31.160
...cue.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.560
Hey!

36:04.600 --> 36:06.200
Get up now, wake up!
We have to go!

36:06.240 --> 36:07.880
We have to go now! Move!

36:24.320 --> 36:25.280
This way.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.640
Wait--

36:33.680 --> 36:35.560
Please, he's going to kill us.

36:35.600 --> 36:36.760
Is he your father?

36:36.800 --> 36:38.920
Yes, and we have to
get out of here now!

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.600
Halt!

37:11.640 --> 37:13.320
Seize them!

37:18.280 --> 37:19.320
Stand aside!

37:19.360 --> 37:20.640
Those prisoners belong to us.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.320
You came here
to parlay.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.360
Leave now!

37:24.400 --> 37:25.280
Take them!

37:26.160 --> 37:27.080
Guards!

37:27.120 --> 37:29.440
Protect the Queen!

37:29.480 --> 37:30.240
Come with me!

37:30.280 --> 37:31.680
It's a trap!

37:31.720 --> 37:34.120
Stand your ground!
Protect the General!

37:34.160 --> 37:36.520
Stay close to me. Hurry.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.880
Quick.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.960
Keep left at every turn,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.120
otherwise
you'll lose your way fast.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.760
You'll come out
south of the castle.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.160
Thank you.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.400
Listen to me.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.440
You are the one.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.520
It's you.

37:53.800 --> 37:54.560
Now go. Run.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.880
-Thank you.
-Run!

38:06.440 --> 38:07.960
Thank you.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.800
Let them go.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
You have made
a big mistake here today.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.240
Are you all right?

39:44.280 --> 39:45.880
Veran told me

39:45.920 --> 39:47.120
what he put here,

39:47.160 --> 39:49.760
the night
he took my mother away.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.080
He said it means,

39:51.120 --> 39:53.600
"Hope is the small daughter
of a blind father."

39:53.640 --> 39:54.760
That's you.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.640
I thought it was.

39:56.680 --> 40:00.000
But not anymore.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.080
They've sealed
the gates.

40:52.120 --> 40:54.000
So that's
a big "fuck you"

40:54.040 --> 40:56.520
from your new queen.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.960
Things change.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.400
Send word to the Regni.

41:04.440 --> 41:08.240
They can start their siege.

41:09.305 --> 41:15.537
