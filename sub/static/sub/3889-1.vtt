<i>A JANG JOON-HWAN FILM</i>

01:16.810 --> 01:18.140
<i>Something was there.</i>

01:19.010 --> 01:22.570
<i>Lurking in the stretching
darkness.</i>

01:29.320 --> 01:30.550
<i>Don't touch the bag.</i>

01:34.960 --> 01:36.290
<i>We've got customers.</i>

01:37.390 --> 01:38.550
<i>They called the cops?</i>

01:38.930 --> 01:40.090
<i>What happened?</i>

01:40.400 --> 01:42.230
The operation was kept
confidential.

01:43.530 --> 01:44.330
Yeah.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.360
I'm telling now 'cause
I just found out.

01:49.470 --> 01:50.730
Who's on?

01:51.510 --> 01:52.410
Beom-soo.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.840
<i>Can you get him off?</i>

01:57.810 --> 01:58.970
We'll try.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.280
We've got cops on board.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.190
Why do parents take
their children for granted?

02:16.930 --> 02:18.760
I'll give it to you for $1.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.530
Just a single dollar
If you look here...

02:21.600 --> 02:23.500
Hey, mister, can I take
a look at that?

02:23.570 --> 02:26.130
Of course. If you look here,
the blade is...

02:30.110 --> 02:32.140
Hey... Throw the knife away.

02:37.450 --> 02:38.390
Hey, is that a gun?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.510
Shit, let's just jump him.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.970
There's just one bullet left!

02:51.600 --> 02:52.790
Aw, shit.

02:57.710 --> 02:58.700
Hey, don't lose it!

03:09.620 --> 03:12.140
Hey, asshole!
Let go of him!

03:17.460 --> 03:18.760
Come over here! Quick!

03:25.670 --> 03:27.030
Get... get behind me...

03:50.360 --> 03:51.790
Oh, I'm sorry...

03:53.400 --> 03:54.390
This is nicely sharpened.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.220
Real sharp.

04:12.410 --> 04:15.680
Beom-soo's a lazy bum,
but he makes one hell of a gun.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.450
You should've seen
those cops' faces.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.649
Is that a gun? Is that a gun?

04:26.130 --> 04:27.490
Buh... bury it?

04:28.930 --> 04:30.260
Buh... but it's still alive!

04:30.600 --> 04:33.190
It's all withered.

04:34.370 --> 04:35.500
No good anymore.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.930
Let's end things here.
It's just too risky.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.440
If they hear he's still alive
they'll definitely... pay up.

04:44.650 --> 04:45.740
Won't they?

04:51.290 --> 04:52.720
This is so not my style.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.520
That's for me to decide.

05:03.770 --> 05:04.630
Got it?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.740
Thuh... then... we're good,
right?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.520
Aw... he's throwing up.
Is... is he sick?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.010
I'm telling you it's gone bad...

05:26.990 --> 05:29.290
Aw... gross!

05:29.760 --> 05:31.020
Young-joo!

05:31.230 --> 05:32.350
Come here for a sec!

05:35.530 --> 05:37.500
Peek-a-boo!

05:42.300 --> 05:44.770
Oh, Young-joo!

05:50.010 --> 05:51.500
He... he's cute...

05:54.050 --> 05:57.310
Whuh... what should we
call him?

<i>The police are searching
for the suspects...</i>

06:07.230 --> 06:10.560
<i>Unrevealing their faces and
dodging surveillance cameras...</i>

06:10.730 --> 06:12.060
<i>Their nickname, Day Breakers</i>

06:12.170 --> 06:16.000
<i>came from their daring capers...
during broad daylight.</i>

06:16.100 --> 06:19.070
<i>A warehouse robbery today...</i>

06:19.140 --> 06:20.770
<i>Nevertheless, their trademark...</i>

06:20.840 --> 06:24.110
<i>untraceable work,
handmade weapons...</i>

06:24.210 --> 06:27.940
<i>and unusual crime technique
are baffling the police...</i>

06:28.080 --> 06:32.820
<i>The Day Breakers case is
shocking the nation.</i>

06:33.150 --> 06:38.350
<i>A community credit coop

<i>HWAYI: A MONSTER BOY</i>

07:27.010 --> 07:30.670
You're as good as they say.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.950
What happened to your eyes?

07:41.320 --> 07:42.920
I was born like this.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.290
Then, you've never seen
anything your entire life?

07:47.700 --> 07:50.790
I can actually see
things close up.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.340
Are you expecting someone, sir?

07:58.610 --> 07:59.370
Huh?

08:01.710 --> 08:03.470
I can hear someone outside.

08:07.980 --> 08:09.380
I can't hear a thing.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.880
But someone's here...

08:11.990 --> 08:13.680
They're here...

08:13.890 --> 08:15.880
Who... who the hell
are you?

08:21.560 --> 08:22.690
And, done!

08:22.860 --> 08:23.700
Hey!

08:24.330 --> 08:28.270
Hey! Do you know who I am,
you fucking crooks?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.070
I know!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.100
Open it.

08:31.510 --> 08:35.030
Bribe money's gotta be laundered
ASAP 'cause everyone knows now.

08:35.309 --> 08:36.840
It's just some silly rumor.

08:39.510 --> 08:40.610
I'll do it, I'll do it!

08:41.480 --> 08:43.280
But...

08:43.990 --> 08:45.080
It's actually this hand.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.620
Think wisely. 'Cause I'm not
in the mood for liars.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.260
I'm not lying.

08:59.530 --> 09:00.930
It's this hand, this one.

09:02.570 --> 09:03.200
Open it.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.520
Hey you motherfuckers!

09:19.220 --> 09:21.250
You shouldn't have
underestimated me.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.920
Consider this your lucky day.

09:23.090 --> 09:25.080
I'm not in the mood for trouble.
So get the hell out!

09:25.730 --> 09:26.850
Don't you get it?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.160
Since I haven't seen your faces,
just beat it!

09:34.100 --> 09:35.040
Now you've seen me.

09:36.270 --> 09:37.030
Kill him.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.000
May I?

09:40.270 --> 09:41.140
Yes, kill him.

09:44.780 --> 09:45.940
Yuck! Shit...

09:46.610 --> 09:47.950
Hey, he's dead! Dead!

09:48.950 --> 09:50.150
What a fucking psycho.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.050
You sure know how to hit
the right spot.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.200
<i>SUNGJI (HOLY LAND)</i>

10:06.630 --> 10:07.800
So you really can't see a thing?

10:10.840 --> 10:11.670
I... I can't...

10:16.540 --> 10:17.710
Whatcha doin?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.150
Aren't ya gonna kill him?

10:20.780 --> 10:21.840
There he goes again...

10:23.250 --> 10:24.810
When the cops come, remember.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.950
You never saw ME,
but I saw YOU.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.120
Okay?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.190
Hurry up!

10:45.710 --> 10:46.830
Hurry, get up close!

10:54.480 --> 10:56.180
Hey, which way did they go?

10:57.350 --> 10:59.250
- Hey, to the left, to the left!
- Aw, shit!

11:19.040 --> 11:21.700
<i>WINTER 2012</i>

12:05.720 --> 12:08.250
Hey, school boy!
Can you lend me a hand?

12:15.630 --> 12:17.100
I've seen you a few times.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.390
You live around here,
don't you?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.360
Which school wears that uniform?

12:27.040 --> 12:29.410
I guess you don't wanna
talk to me, right?

13:00.270 --> 13:02.300
Hey, school boy,
what's your name?

13:08.620 --> 13:09.240
Hwayi...

13:10.890 --> 13:11.680
My name is Hwayi.

13:12.620 --> 13:13.250
Hwayi?

13:14.890 --> 13:16.150
What an unusual name.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.600
Bye, Hwayi!
Thanks for the orange!

13:34.840 --> 13:37.330
Why kill him when he couldn't
call the cops anyway?

13:38.410 --> 13:42.250
That dude's morally fucked up.
He's just a crook.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.090
But he's an ex-prosecutor.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.350
This could get us in deep shit.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.160
You...

13:50.990 --> 13:53.990
should've finished the job.
Why let the other guy go?

13:54.730 --> 13:57.100
Why do you have to do
things on a whim?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.590
- What's the use of planning...
- Enough, I get it.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.440
Wasn't this the plan anyway?

14:36.370 --> 14:39.900
That crook stashed so much
for himself it's hard counting.

14:56.260 --> 14:57.320
Let's go to the
public bathhouse later.

14:59.290 --> 14:59.950
I don't want to.

15:02.230 --> 15:03.490
What's the big deal?

15:12.040 --> 15:12.840
Shit!

15:14.880 --> 15:16.280
Little twerp.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.410
- I'm home.
- Hey!

15:20.010 --> 15:20.640
Hwuh, Hwayi

15:21.050 --> 15:24.610
Whi, which way did you come?
I... I kept watching for you.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.420
The orchard.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.550
You should've called me.
Whuh, why bother walking?

15:29.660 --> 15:30.390
Son!

15:31.330 --> 15:32.420
Great job today.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.790
You deserve this.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.990
Duh... don't give too much
muh... money to the kid.

15:38.270 --> 15:42.130
A real man should have
a fat pocket, right?

15:43.700 --> 15:45.070
This will make my pocket
fat enough.

15:45.370 --> 15:46.670
Any problems on the way?

15:47.440 --> 15:48.200
No, dad.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.500
Good job today.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.580
Yes, father.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.880
Fruh, from now on,
call me, okay?

16:13.370 --> 16:15.230
Did I ever mention I was
craving for this?

16:16.670 --> 16:19.370
No, but they're your favorite
anyway.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.340
Let's split one. Wait...

16:39.260 --> 16:42.160
Hey, Beom-soo. What did you
do to the bullet?

16:43.300 --> 16:45.700
- Did he hit it? Let me see.
- Nice... He totalled it.

17:08.119 --> 17:11.560
Nice! We should get him
into the Olympics.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.319
It looks like our son's
great at everything.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.300
- Stop practicing...
- Let's eat.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.359
Come here. Come, Hwayi.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.670
But Beom-soo, where would
we use these bullets?

17:23.869 --> 17:25.810
Korea's all about blades.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.810
Hwayi, let's have a blade fight
after dinner, okay?

17:29.440 --> 17:32.880
<i>Suk-tae's getting more
fucked up with age.</i>

17:33.250 --> 17:36.080
<i>He's getting more and more
crazier.</i>

17:37.050 --> 17:39.750
<i>He should think of the people
cleaning up after his shit.</i>

17:40.620 --> 17:42.780
<i>He can't go on shitting
all over my territory...</i>

17:42.860 --> 17:43.590
What about the blind guy?

17:43.960 --> 17:47.990
<i>Who cares? He's scared shitless
but you never know.</i>

17:48.960 --> 17:51.690
<i>In my opinion,
Suk-tae has no vision.</i>

17:52.400 --> 17:54.130
<i>You and I need to be swimming
in bigger waters.</i>

17:55.940 --> 17:59.270
<i>Hey! Want me to fix you up
with Mr. JEON from Incheon?</i>

17:59.610 --> 18:00.340
Who?

18:00.710 --> 18:02.940
<i>You know, Mr. JEON Seung-ki
from Incheon.</i>

18:03.540 --> 18:04.670
<i>Now that's a man with a vision!</i>

18:06.150 --> 18:08.980
You call that vision? It's just
gangsters doing business.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.990
He's not the same man
you used to know.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.690
<i>He's handling all the big
redevelopment projects</i>

18:17.960 --> 18:19.690
<i>in the metropolitan area.</i>

18:20.330 --> 18:23.560
The dude is now holding the,
veins of Korea.

18:23.960 --> 18:24.730
You don't say?

18:25.200 --> 18:29.600
They're on a redevelopment
project in our district.

18:30.600 --> 18:35.070
But one house is giving them
a headache 'cause they won't budge.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.310
How about removing them?

18:39.010 --> 18:40.780
We're no mercenary gangsters.

18:41.250 --> 18:45.650
They've already tried that
shit on these people.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.560
Breaking.

18:48.220 --> 18:49.420
Threatening.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.060
Torching.

18:53.930 --> 18:57.760
But they just won't budge.
And legally they have the right.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.300
We have no other choice

19:01.640 --> 19:02.530
but... to kill them off.

19:03.770 --> 19:06.540
So, why won't these people
move out?

19:07.470 --> 19:08.870
That's the fucked up part.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.540
IM Hyung-taek lives there.

19:12.010 --> 19:13.880
Who? LEE Myung-taek?

19:14.150 --> 19:16.980
No you moron, IM Hyung-taek,
the owner of Sungji Cement!

19:18.990 --> 19:21.150
<i>You can go wild
on your asking price.</i>

19:21.790 --> 19:23.990
<i>And if the job's done well,</i>

19:24.890 --> 19:28.160
<i>you'll get your network with
Mr. JEON and your vision.</i>

19:28.300 --> 19:30.130
<i>- How about it? Are you in?
- Hey...</i>

19:31.070 --> 19:34.500
I'm a bit busy now.
Let's talk later.

19:34.570 --> 19:37.730
<i>Busy? Are you kidding me?
What the fuck...</i>

19:41.580 --> 19:43.010
You're not busy at all...

19:54.920 --> 19:58.290
After a 3 month language course,
you can start school.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.050
And this too.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.730
Memorize the name
and date of birth.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.600
Basic things, that
I'll take care of,

20:11.540 --> 20:15.530
but for the time being...
you're on your own, okay?

20:19.110 --> 20:20.240
Okay. I'll talk to him.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.280
<i>Trust me. You'll regret this bad
if you don't do this.</i>

20:23.550 --> 20:24.610
I'll leave you two to talk.

20:33.190 --> 20:33.850
What's going on?

20:38.830 --> 20:40.300
I'm going out.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.070
Where to?

20:43.940 --> 20:44.730
Downtown.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.640
You're going out quite
often these days.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.110
Are you wearing that again?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.040
I prefer this.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.510
'Cause it doesn't stand out.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.650
You've grown again.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.190
So he wants to go?

21:09.430 --> 21:11.760
We should let him go.
It's what we agreed on.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.090
Did we?

21:19.340 --> 21:20.900
We can't keep him here like this.

21:21.910 --> 21:23.840
Hwayi's different from us.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.280
Different...

21:29.020 --> 21:30.780
You used to be different,

21:31.520 --> 21:32.250
weren't you?

21:35.820 --> 21:37.380
So what's his excuse
for staying?

21:38.260 --> 21:39.280
That IM Hyung-taek?

21:49.840 --> 21:53.000
<i>SEOKHWAWON GARDENING</i>

22:52.230 --> 22:53.900
A car accident!

22:53.900 --> 22:56.560
You crazy bastard!
You wanna get killed?

22:57.340 --> 22:59.900
Your eyes aren't
there for fun, asshole!

23:00.240 --> 23:01.870
I almost crashed into you!

23:04.750 --> 23:05.740
Jesus!

23:11.750 --> 23:12.950
You're good!

23:16.390 --> 23:17.720
Are you gonna apply
for art school?

23:18.530 --> 23:22.050
Doesn't it cost a lot?
Are your parents okay with it?

23:27.370 --> 23:30.170
I'm so jealous.
I'd like to study photography...

23:32.210 --> 23:34.700
But they want me to quit.
It costs too much.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.110
Hey, can you draw me?

23:41.850 --> 23:42.470
Huh?

23:42.720 --> 23:46.180
I'm supposed to draw
a self-portrait for my art class.

23:46.590 --> 23:49.250
Don't try to be so perfect.

23:49.890 --> 23:53.660
Go easy with the drawing.
Okay? How about Saturday?

23:56.400 --> 23:57.060
Okay.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.700
Really? Great! I was dying to
get out of this assignment.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.070
I'll take your photo in exchange.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.440
Wait... something's missing.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.370
Here, bite on this.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.640
Okay, that's good!

24:23.390 --> 24:27.230
And I did it again!
An artist never blames the material.

24:27.890 --> 24:29.620
Your number!
I'll send it to you.

24:39.310 --> 24:42.800
Look! Look!
There's a pervert over there!

24:44.510 --> 24:45.670
Have another drink.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.310
Stop enticing me, sweetheart.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.780
- Let me have a little squeeze.
- Not this!

24:52.320 --> 24:54.650
Jeez, that dude is totally whack!

24:57.690 --> 25:01.150
- Let's have another drink.
- Hwayi... Hwayi!

25:03.960 --> 25:04.690
You?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.230
Hwayi!

25:06.530 --> 25:07.630
You know that guy?

25:08.670 --> 25:09.330
Yeah...

25:10.940 --> 25:12.000
He's my dad.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.730
Who's that next to him?

25:15.940 --> 25:17.670
Stop drinking and driving.

25:17.740 --> 25:19.800
- It's dangerous.
- Who could it be, who?

25:19.910 --> 25:22.210
Who are you talking about?
I don't know.

25:23.950 --> 25:28.080
Wuh... want me to teach you
how to get girls?

25:28.190 --> 25:29.520
No thanks.

25:29.620 --> 25:30.450
First.

25:31.860 --> 25:32.660
Screw her.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.320
Then you're halfway there.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.870
Yeah, halfway... Just her body.

25:38.500 --> 25:43.560
Then guh... go for the kill
and grab her heart.

25:43.970 --> 25:44.870
Like how?

25:45.670 --> 25:46.870
Look carefully.

25:47.410 --> 25:50.380
This, this is the asshole.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.640
This one huh... this one's
the hole, the hole.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.770
And this one's the one
I told you about.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.550
Right here, get it real wet.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.090
And then, just do this.

26:01.220 --> 26:03.620
And go at it.

26:04.190 --> 26:09.430
Dad, dad, how come you're
always talking like that?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.960
And for a big one,
you just have to...

26:12.030 --> 26:13.190
Dad, dad...

26:13.670 --> 26:14.360
What?

26:15.700 --> 26:16.860
Aw come on...

26:19.670 --> 26:23.370
Hey, slow down a bit,
a bit, a little bit.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.180
Slow down.

26:25.510 --> 26:29.810
I'm glad I'm not driving.
My face totally shows.

26:30.050 --> 26:30.920
But dad...

26:32.050 --> 26:33.380
I'm in my school uniform.

26:35.860 --> 26:41.020
So stop wearing that uniform!
You're not even in school!

26:41.330 --> 26:44.230
They'll notice your uniform.
Loo, look down.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.460
- Hey, isn't that a high school student?
- Go, go, go.

26:48.030 --> 26:49.020
Go, go!

26:51.540 --> 26:52.370
Get them!

26:52.770 --> 26:53.760
Hurry, get in the car!

27:06.220 --> 27:09.710
If... if it was me. I... I'd have
ditched those fuckers by now.

27:14.490 --> 27:15.590
Sir, sir!

27:17.700 --> 27:19.170
Why, those sons-of-bitches!

27:26.440 --> 27:28.200
Step on the brakes and
slow the speed down.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.670
Sir, slow the speed down,
the speed!

27:32.180 --> 27:34.840
That's it, so you wanna play,
you motherfuckers?

27:35.350 --> 27:37.180
There, over there...
intersection...

27:41.220 --> 27:42.620
Grab the side brakes...

27:46.730 --> 27:49.090
Nuh, nuh, now! NOW!

28:02.280 --> 28:05.140
We're good! We're good!

28:05.850 --> 28:08.410
What the fuck.
Hey, you sons-of-bitches!

28:10.280 --> 28:14.480
Good job. But your timing
wuh... was a bit off...

28:14.890 --> 28:17.360
Your cue was a bit off!

28:17.520 --> 28:19.190
It was? No...

28:19.490 --> 28:24.160
It's 'cause you said
nun... nun... now!

28:27.000 --> 28:31.340
When did I say nuh, nuh, now?

28:31.440 --> 28:32.870
I said, now!

28:33.010 --> 28:34.630
So you think you can
make fun of me?

28:34.740 --> 28:36.710
You know what I'll be
doing to you!

28:36.780 --> 28:40.040
- Cut off your dick and eat it!
- I know! Stop!

28:41.250 --> 28:44.910
That's not the same story
you first gave me!

28:45.950 --> 28:49.550
You can't keep changing
your story like this.

28:52.790 --> 28:56.520
Day Breakers or not,
this isn't working. Let him go.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.530
Got it, sir.

29:00.430 --> 29:01.730
May I try?

29:07.570 --> 29:08.410
Who are you?

29:09.580 --> 29:10.870
How'd you get in here?

29:15.480 --> 29:18.280
Intercity Investigation Crime Affairs,
Det. CHOI Jeong-min.

29:20.850 --> 29:21.790
You can't see this?

29:23.920 --> 29:24.720
Really?

29:25.490 --> 29:27.190
Sir, who the hell's that asshole?

29:27.630 --> 29:29.490
Master CB CHOI Jeong-min.

29:29.860 --> 29:30.850
CB?

29:31.060 --> 29:34.760
Crazy Bastard. He's got
a grudge against the Day Breakers.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.070
He's known for his creativity.
So let's see how he does.

29:39.270 --> 29:40.800
So, you can't see...

29:42.180 --> 29:42.970
What the...

29:47.250 --> 29:49.110
Your pupils tell me you can see.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.140
Why claim you can't see
when you can?

29:53.050 --> 29:55.350
Were you threatened?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.320
Did they tell you to
keep your mouth shut?

30:01.390 --> 30:03.730
Is that why you won't
say anything?

30:07.900 --> 30:09.670
Fine. Then you may leave.

30:12.670 --> 30:13.230
Huh?

30:13.740 --> 30:15.870
We're done, you're free to go.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.270
Really?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.610
I'll tell the press you can see.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.510
And that you've seen
the killer's face.

30:25.850 --> 30:28.650
If they're the right guys,
they'll come to get you.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.490
Then I'll sweep in! And nab 'em.

30:33.130 --> 30:34.030
So get the hell out of here.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.790
Shit, didn't I tell you to
get the hell out?

30:42.970 --> 30:44.100
Hey, KIM!

30:46.040 --> 30:48.240
We don't need him anymore,
so see him out!

30:48.580 --> 30:49.980
- What?
- Are you out of your mind?

31:10.900 --> 31:12.660
<i>URGENT, THE POLICE</i>

31:13.670 --> 31:14.530
There was a scent.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.170
I smelled this scent on him.

31:20.070 --> 31:20.940
A scent?

31:21.270 --> 31:23.740
I smelled Chinese Juniper
on his hands.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.240
It's about 8 years old.

31:33.690 --> 31:35.780
They were... laughing.

31:37.790 --> 31:39.160
Even while they were
handling the body.

31:40.490 --> 31:41.480
Just laughing...

31:41.930 --> 31:42.860
Hello.

31:53.770 --> 31:56.170
You saw his face, right?

31:56.940 --> 31:57.880
His eyes...

32:00.380 --> 32:01.850
They weren't human.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.620
He was...

32:30.280 --> 32:34.180
Torn skin should be stitched up
quickly or else it'll fester.

32:36.850 --> 32:38.010
Do you get what I mean?

32:39.820 --> 32:40.410
Yes.

32:45.160 --> 32:45.820
Take it.

33:09.080 --> 33:09.780
Get ready.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.080
No need to be afraid.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.420
Just think of it as a pig's head.

33:23.060 --> 33:23.790
Pull the trigger.

33:34.170 --> 33:34.870
Shoot!

34:06.940 --> 34:08.270
Is... is it cold?

34:09.380 --> 34:10.670
Wuh... want me to turn
the heater on?

34:29.429 --> 34:32.020
It's so cold! I'm freezing!

34:40.310 --> 34:41.710
Why can't you leave
the boy alone?

34:42.510 --> 34:43.340
You crazy fuck!

34:44.080 --> 34:45.050
Let go of him!

34:46.909 --> 34:48.469
Father... Father...

34:48.679 --> 34:50.710
Father... Father...

35:03.030 --> 35:04.050
Why didn't you shoot him?

35:05.930 --> 35:06.760
Tell me.

35:13.210 --> 35:15.680
I... I saw the monster...

35:16.540 --> 35:17.270
Monster?

35:20.150 --> 35:20.880
Do you see it?

35:23.220 --> 35:25.080
Do you see it now?
Do you?

35:29.360 --> 35:30.910
I don't think I can do it.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.380
What?

35:34.960 --> 35:35.860
Say that again.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.630
I don't want to do it, father.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.000
Why not?

35:45.140 --> 35:47.300
Everyone else is,
so why can't you?

35:51.980 --> 35:53.570
You think you're different
from your dads?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.480
You think you're all clean?

35:56.250 --> 35:57.080
Is that it?

36:02.420 --> 36:03.450
Yeah, your dad is dirty.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.120
And that embarrasses you.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.500
Is that why you're running away?

36:11.800 --> 36:12.420
Is it?

36:14.830 --> 36:18.740
Forgive me, forgive me, father.
Forgive me. Forgive me.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.570
Then I guess you should
be punished.

36:27.050 --> 36:27.740
You tell me then.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.510
If you made a mistake
you should be punished, right?

36:42.700 --> 36:43.390
Okay...

36:45.370 --> 36:47.100
I'll get rid of the monster.

36:54.070 --> 36:55.370
I'll get rid of it for you.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.110
That dirty monster.

36:59.710 --> 37:02.340
No, father, no! No!

37:02.520 --> 37:06.180
There's a monster in here!
It's gonna get me!

37:07.420 --> 37:08.850
Stop being a wuss.

37:09.890 --> 37:13.050
Monster or not, don't turn away.
Look it straight in the eyes!

37:13.930 --> 37:15.330
And it'll go away.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.420
Father... Father!

37:22.840 --> 37:23.800
Father!

37:30.810 --> 37:32.570
Don't come near! Go away!

37:34.210 --> 37:35.740
Go away! Go!

37:40.620 --> 37:43.280
Dad! Dad! Dad!

37:43.920 --> 37:45.690
Dad! Dad!

37:48.690 --> 37:51.060

37:51.360 --> 37:55.170
<i>Father! Forgive me!

37:57.400 --> 37:58.530
Let's do the job.

38:01.740 --> 38:02.500
That IM Hyung-taek.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.710
We can't just let him
stay like that.

38:23.430 --> 38:26.230
It's a 30% advance.
There are just two requests.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.730
Make it look like a robbery.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.600
And finish the job by
Sunday morning.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.630
What? Tomorrow?

38:32.870 --> 38:36.600
He's losing $300,000 daily
just in interest 'cause of them.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.210
They go to church on Sundays.
We'll break in then and wait.

38:41.610 --> 38:42.550
How long will it take?

38:43.250 --> 38:46.650
The locks look like imports.
I guess 10 minutes at the least?

38:47.250 --> 38:50.660
Hell no! There are a lot of eyes
watching with the construction.

38:50.820 --> 38:54.230
And IM's public grievances
have cops patrolling the area.

38:54.590 --> 38:57.090
It's too risky.
There'll be witnesses.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.960
I... I agree.
Let's not do it, okay?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.600
Suk-tae?

39:26.260 --> 39:27.780

39:27.860 --> 39:29.730
<i>YOU HAVE 4 MISSED CALLS</i>

40:17.880 --> 40:19.350
You should go to the hospital.

40:31.460 --> 40:32.930
Is it those people again?

40:34.530 --> 40:36.720
Just finish your meal.

40:43.340 --> 40:46.740
You think... we should give up?

41:24.480 --> 41:25.170
Go.

41:27.010 --> 41:29.450
Juh... just do as you're told.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.950
Just open the door and guh...
get the hell out.

YOON Suk-tae, YOON Ki-tae
and JANG Young-joo.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.400
You all grew up at the Sungji
Orphanage in Incheon.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.340
IM Hyung-taek's father was
the foundation's Chief Director.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.470
Think carefully.

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:13.610
Are you sure you don't know?

01:38:25.190 --> 01:38:29.130
That's why you gotta make
friends with the right people.

01:38:30.230 --> 01:38:33.290
I wasn't always a bad person,
you know?

01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:40.140
But... Shit...
I made the wrong friends.

01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:43.040
And now I'm in deep shit.

01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:46.370
You startled me,
you fucking asshole!

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:50.620
What about the kid?

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.250
Did you kill him?

01:38:55.190 --> 01:38:56.320
She's on the 4th floor.

01:38:57.130 --> 01:38:59.930
I've cleared the ward for
the job, so go get...

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:05.930
What?

01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:10.940
Aw shit...

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.650
These fuckers are
the Day Breakers, right?

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:37.660
Get out.

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:39.790
You people also killed
IM Hyung-taek, right?

01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:45.060
Who's this kid?
The student at the crime scene.

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.160
He's was in it as well,
wasn't he?

01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:49.570
The kid's not dead, is he?

01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:52.040
Hwayi...

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.440
Hwayi's a good boy.
It's not his fault.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:57.970
Hwayi?

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:02.920
Hwayi tree...

01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:06.140
What the fuck...

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.790
Did you people...

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.220
really raise the kid?

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:21.900
You never saw him
grow up, did you?

01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.440
He was about this tall at first.

01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:27.970
Now he's...

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.610
Ah, but you've
seen him before, right?

01:41:34.650 --> 01:41:36.210
He's a good kid.

01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:39.920
And mighty bright.

01:41:41.190 --> 01:41:42.720
Whatever he's taught,
he learns fast.

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.920
He's good at drawing, too.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.790
He's such a great kid,

01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:54.660
but he has this sickness.

01:41:56.810 --> 01:42:00.610
He keeps on seeing things.
When it's bad, he has fits.

01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:03.330
It's heartbreaking to watch.

01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:09.480
I guess he takes that after me.

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:14.220
I used to be like that.

01:42:16.290 --> 01:42:17.160
Don't come near!

01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:19.990
Or I'll kill you...
Don't come near...

01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:23.900
Don't come near...
Or I'll kill you...

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.270
Hyung-taek...

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.280
I bet he had a heart
bigger than Jesus...

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.110
He was such a good person.

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:45.780
He said...

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.550
It was fear and anger
that tainted my soul.

01:42:51.330 --> 01:42:54.260
And praying will make
the monster go away.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.830
So I prayed really hard...

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.770
But it didn't fucking go away.

01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:15.310
I was sick of it all.

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.120
Of every goddamn prayer
and monster.

01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:27.690
So I screwed a girl he liked.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.060
Oh, I liked her too,

01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:33.800
but the bitch
didn't like me back.

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:37.430
So I...

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:42.940
Yeah?

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.850
Young-joo!

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.970
Once I got myself all dirty,
it finally went away.

01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:19.150
That filthy monster.

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.290
Oh, god...

01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:46.400
Do you get what I'm saying?

01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:52.110
You have to become the monster
to make the monster go away.

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:03.590
But Hwayi went too far
with what he did today.

01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:06.690
Don't you agree?

01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:12.020
Don't worry.

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.400
Hwayi will get better
when it's all over.

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:29.950
Answer, for crying out loud!

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:34.710
- No...
- Shit! I've got them!

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:36.850
- The Day Breakers.
- Not Hwayi...

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.520
I'll give you the address
so send me backup!

01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:42.960
Not Hwayi...

01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:47.430
Why...

01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:50.300
Why...

01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:54.170
WHY!

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:57.540
I've tried to
figure that out myself.

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:01.980
Ask when you get up there.
He'd know for sure.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:28.800
What's that?

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:30.900
A cop?

01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:34.740
I'm impressed.

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:38.040
So, how was it?

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:40.970
It's no big deal, is it?

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.260
You wanna go to a place
that's warm?

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:02.040
You know? A place so hot
you can't even think.

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.680
Let's eat first, Hwayi's coming.

01:48:20.590 --> 01:48:22.460
Not Hwayi, not him...

01:48:24.230 --> 01:48:26.630
Didn't you hear me?
Make something to eat.

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.400
Make it yourself.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:30.320
What?

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:34.340
Filthy bastard,
fucking son-of-a-bitch.

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.310
Make something to eat.

01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:52.580
No... not anymore...

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.320
No?

01:48:56.290 --> 01:48:57.880
Then why didn't you leave?

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.190
What more is left for you
to suck out of us?

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.190
Tell me.

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:06.190
You're scared, right?

01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:12.730
'Cause it's scarier out there
now, right?

01:49:12.810 --> 01:49:14.640
It's better in here, isn't it?

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:18.680
Everything you need is here.
I gave it all to you, right?

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.980
You're afraid, too, aren't you?

01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:27.350
You were scared, too,
weren't you?

01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:32.930
'Cause Hyung-taek and Hwayi
were different from you.

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.250
This scared you, right?

01:49:37.930 --> 01:49:39.870
What the fuck
are you saying? Huh?

01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:43.170
Stop.

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.800
Just let Hwayi go, please...

01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:52.140
Stop?

01:49:53.850 --> 01:49:58.310
Stop what?
I'm just getting started.

01:49:59.350 --> 01:50:00.010
Hey.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.460
Is that why you were waiting?
To run off with Hwayi?

01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:09.390
Why? Isn't a toe enough?

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.000
Want me to cut
your throat this time?

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.830
Stop it.

01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:26.180
See, I told you he'd come.

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:30.950
So what do you think?

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.520
Your home is the best place
to be, right?

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:38.220
Why did you kill her?

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.230
What? Who?

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.420
Why...

01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:46.790
Why did you do it?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.630
Why did you do that to me?

01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:53.570
You said you were
seeing a monster.

01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:56.840
You call that a reason?

01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:02.010
Your dads are all monsters,
so you should become one too.

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.480
Right?

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.680
That way we can all
live together.

01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:11.050
Live together?

01:51:11.630 --> 01:51:12.390
What?

01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:20.330
Are you still all confused?
Do you still think I'm dirty?

01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:23.330
Think about it.

01:51:24.810 --> 01:51:26.500
How dirty
you've become yourself.

01:51:30.810 --> 01:51:32.110
Aren't you feeling
much better now?

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:37.740
You don't see it anymore,
do you?

01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:40.380
Things like the monster.

01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.690
No one moves!

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.660
I got you now,
you motherfuckers.

01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:55.560
What do we have here?
A monster from the basement.

01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:02.340
Don't move. I'm a cop,
you son-of-a-bitch!

01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:05.380
Hey! Drop your gun!

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:07.910
So.

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.080
Who are you gonna shoot?

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.990
Me or the monster?

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.200
You fucking bitch...

01:52:34.610 --> 01:52:36.200
So you think you're
better than me?

01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:38.640
Stop.

01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:41.580
Crazy bitch! Filthy bitch!

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:43.780
Stop it!

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:45.550
Am I so dirty?

01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:47.920
Stop! Drop the gun, asshole!

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.760
You're fucking pieces of shit.

01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:06.840
How dare you shoot my son?

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:17.680
Haven't you had enough?

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.590
So you hate everything
including your dad, huh?

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.720
Then you're on your own
from now on.

01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:31.030
Don't!

01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:33.660
Pull the trigger.

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.210
You fucking retard... KILL!

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.310
Stop...

01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:47.080
Stop!

01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:56.220
Why?

01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:58.330
Why can't you pull the trigger?

01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:00.420
Do you see the monster again?

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.830
Do you still see it?

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:11.330
No...

01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.980
No...

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:15.970
No...

01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:20.140
Not... anymore...

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:25.110
Forgive me...

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.020
Forgive me, father.

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:45.300
Get up.

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.250
No...

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.510
Hwayi... No...

01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:08.260
Okay.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.190
It's been hell for you,
hasn't it?

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:25.810
It's all over.
It's all over now.

01:55:29.650 --> 01:55:31.310
Dad will take care of everything.

01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:34.590
Me, your dad...

01:55:45.670 --> 01:55:47.030
All I need is you.

01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:50.530
Only you...

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:48.360
- Hey, stop running!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:56.790
- You sly bitch.
- Stop!

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.130
- What is it?
- He was really hot.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.800
Who?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.440
He asked me to
give this to you. A boy!

01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:06.810
What is it?

01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:08.430
Beats me. Open it, quick!

01:58:24.190 --> 01:58:26.060
- Jeez!
- This is totally whack!

01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:28.630
I wanted to get one,
but it's so expensive.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.470
We're so jealous!

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:31.760
The guy...

01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:33.530
The boy... where's he now?

01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:35.730
The playing field... I guess?

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.920
Our special guests of honor
opening this historic moment

01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:02.750
for Golden City are coming up
on stage! The mayor of Incheon.

01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:04.920
What an amazing accomplishment!

01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:09.000
See how this redevelopment
makes such a difference!

01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:11.900
You know we still have
a long way to go.

01:59:12.010 --> 01:59:12.770
Of course I do.

01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:15.910
Do you mind if I stand
next to Mr. JEON?

01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:19.450
You know it might start a scandal.

01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:22.710
It's my pleasure to be linked
with him.

01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:25.010
