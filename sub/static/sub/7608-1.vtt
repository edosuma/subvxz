You were hoIding your breath.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.799
He's so cute.

11:48.841 --> 11:52.004
And so guIIibIe.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.056
( <i>groans</i> )

12:11.097 --> 12:12.291
What happened down there?

12:12.331 --> 12:13.525
( <i>gasping</i> ):
You wouIdn't...

12:13.566 --> 12:14.692
beIieve me if I toId you.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.062
Try me.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.865
AII right. here goes.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.701
So I meet Eris.
the Goddess of Chaos.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.296
She's got
a major crush on me.

12:22.341 --> 12:24.309
and she invited me
back to her pIace.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.708
Ha! That's a good one!

12:27.747 --> 12:29.510
-Goddess of Chaos?
-( <i>crew chuckling</i> )

12:29.548 --> 12:31.015
Oh. I'm writing that down.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.984
So. that's it then?
No Book.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.542
Now what do we do?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.884
A IittIe patience. Rat.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.684
It's not Iike we don't know
where it's going.

12:39.291 --> 12:42.852
Men. aII saiIs to Syracuse!

13:24.670 --> 13:26.433
For as Iong
as I can remember.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.167
I've dreamed of this moment.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.266
The sacred treasure

13:30.309 --> 13:32.869
that's protected us
for a thousand years

13:32.912 --> 13:35.005
is now in Syracuse.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.776
-A toast!
-To Dymas!

( <i>swords unsheathe</i> )

13:46.992 --> 13:48.323
You see?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.885
This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.192
Mm-hmm.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.789
What is he doing here?

13:53.899 --> 13:56.197
At Ieast he's not out
robbing someone.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.398
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.303
( <i>panting</i> )

14:02.374 --> 14:03.432
I'II bet you ten crowns

14:03.475 --> 14:05.272
you're about to put
those swords down.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.778
I'II take that bet.

14:06.812 --> 14:07.801
PROTEUS:
Guards...

14:07.880 --> 14:09.370

14:09.415 --> 14:11.610
I don't see you for ten years.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.346
and now twice in one day...
( <i>scoffs</i> )

14:14.386 --> 14:15.785
You're smothering me.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.118
( <i>chuckles</i> )

14:17.156 --> 14:20.455
I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your Iife... again.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.823
( <i>chuckles</i> )

14:21.894 --> 14:24.658
You probabIy just heard
we had free food and wine.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.664
You hear that. guys?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.928
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.127
Come on.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.863
There's someone
I want you to meet.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.397

14:52.291 --> 14:53.280
( <i>clears throat</i> )

14:53.325 --> 14:55.520
Sinbad. I wouId
Iike to introduce you

14:55.561 --> 14:56.858
to my fiancee.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.490
the Lady Marina.
Ambassador from Thrace.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.332
So. this is the infamous Sinbad.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.397
I heard aII about this morning.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.342
First you tried to rob Proteus.
and then you save his Iife.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.535
So. which are you...

15:14.580 --> 15:16.878
a thief or a hero?

15:16.949 --> 15:19.008
PROTEUS:
Sinbad wanted

15:19.051 --> 15:21.144
to give me an opportunity
to thank...

-( <i>indistinct conversation</i> )

Eight months on the sea

15:30.696 --> 15:33.221
with nothing but eggs
and pickIes...

15:33.265 --> 15:36.029
you don't know what
that can do to a man.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.536
Oh. it's aImost too easy.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.561
There's onIy
a handfuI of guards.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.573
Forget it.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.869
Let's get back to the ship.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.034
Just Iike that?

15:44.076 --> 15:45.941
But the Book is aImost ours.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.274
( <i>sighs</i> )

15:49.315 --> 15:50.282
Oh.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.045
Wh-What?
Who is she?

15:52.084 --> 15:53.608
An oId girIfriend?

15:53.652 --> 15:55.483
I'm afraid it's
not that simpIe.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.352
Let's go.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.857
Jed. pack it up.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.156
What? I-I... I just put the...

16:09.735 --> 16:13.364
Oh. this is just too easy.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.406
Look at it this way:

16:16.442 --> 16:17.602
Now that Sinbad's gone.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.043
your father can finaIIy reIax
and enjoy the evening.

16:20.079 --> 16:21.046
( <i>Proteus chuckles</i> )

16:21.080 --> 16:22.707
WeII. you're right about that.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.113
He's trying not to show it.

16:24.149 --> 16:28.085
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.487
He's been pIanning this day
his whoIe Iife.

16:31.523 --> 16:35.186
And soon it wiII be
your responsibiIity.

16:35.227 --> 16:37.286
Our responsibiIity.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.726
( <i>sighing</i> ):
It's beautifuI.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.964
It is.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.735
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.503
There are guards
on every IeveI.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.169
and if you Iook
up to the...

16:53.879 --> 16:56.143
Ah... ( <i>chuckles softly</i> )

You were taIking about
the ocean. weren't you?

16:58.650 --> 17:02.882
I onIy wish I'd
seen more of it.

17:02.921 --> 17:07.449

There's so much wonder.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.300
Marina...

17:20.105 --> 17:23.165
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.300
It's aIways been expected of us.

17:25.344 --> 17:28.711
But poIitics is not a reason
to get married.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.715
Uh. and I don't want you
to do this

17:30.749 --> 17:32.376
just because it's your duty.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.118
I'm asking you
for myseIf now.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.783

17:48.200 --> 17:49.565
AIthough. I'm not sure.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.899
They're doing something

It's about time.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.624
Do you reaIize
how serious this is?

Do you reaIize

20:03.936 --> 20:05.767
how many times
I've heard that today?

20:05.804 --> 20:06.736
You've betrayed Syracuse!

Proteus. here's
the way this works.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.374
First. I actuaIIy
commit a crime.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.405
and then you get
to bIame me for it!

20:17.449 --> 20:20.418
Then how do
you expIain this?

20:22.754 --> 20:24.278
Eris.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.153
What?

It was Proteus.

You see. he'd watched it aII
from his room in the paIace.
