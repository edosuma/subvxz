00:18.284 --> 00:19.518
(ellie)
previously on <i>gracepoint...</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:20.786
You have to change all this.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.187
No more stress.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.522
If you don't,
you'll end up dead.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.957
It's about mom.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.158
I went to
the bank machine yesterday.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.493
Cleaned me out.
Feel like forgetting

00:27.495 --> 00:29.361
Your troubles a little while?
Yeah.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.462
Why don't you
invite him to dinner?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.463
Invite who to dinner?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.498
Carver.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.499
It's like he was in a boat,

00:33.501 --> 00:34.533
Or he was put in a boat.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.868
Mark, do you own a boat?
Yeah.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.302
What have we got here?

00:37.304 --> 00:39.972
Danny in the gas station,
just like dean said.

00:39.974 --> 00:41.707
(emmett)
you're still sure
that's all he's guilty of?

00:41.709 --> 00:42.708
He's got nothing to do
with this?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.510
I don't know.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.279
Promise me there's
nothing else I don't know about.

00:55.488 --> 00:56.722
(man)
he's here.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.157
One of the night boats
called it in.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.992
No sign of anyone
on it.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.994
Who do we call:

01:01.996 --> 01:04.163
The harbormaster, coastguard?

01:04.165 --> 01:07.166
I need people out there
collecting every piece.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.167
The tide's coming in.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.168
It'll wash up soon enough.

01:09.170 --> 01:13.238
No, get it done!

01:13.240 --> 01:14.673
Call the harbormaster.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.409
<i>I need a marine crew</i>
<i>to north beach.</i>

01:54.380 --> 01:57.449
[cell phone buzzing]

02:10.130 --> 02:12.297
I couldn't sleep.

02:12.299 --> 02:16.969
That's understandable.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.237
You saw yesterday.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.472
You saw how angry mark is.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.307
I think you're both angry.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.742
Have you ruled him out?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.911
Beth,
it's 4:00 in the morning.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.980
Well,
what about the backpacker?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.248
We don't know yet.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.750
Ellie,
please tell me something.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.285
You had mark in
for a whole day.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.453
Then without
saying anything,

02:34.455 --> 02:36.088
You move on
to these other guys.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.923
At least tell me if my husband
is still a suspect.

02:37.925 --> 02:38.924
It's not that simple.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.259
It is very simple.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.327
Do you think
he killed danny?

02:47.433 --> 02:49.268
I don't.

02:49.270 --> 02:53.105
But there were
gaps in his movements

02:53.107 --> 02:54.273
We needed to know about

02:54.275 --> 02:59.444
That he did not want...
To talk about.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.446
Movements when?
The night danny died?

03:01.448 --> 03:02.948
Beth--
and where was he?

03:02.950 --> 03:06.285
Just tell me.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.020
You need to ask him.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.960
I saw him

03:14.962 --> 03:17.296
With gemma fisher

03:17.298 --> 03:20.132
The same night
you let him go.

03:20.134 --> 03:24.303
Does mark know that?

03:24.305 --> 03:27.806
Beth, you have to...
You have to tell him.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.208
You have to talk to him.

03:34.814 --> 03:38.650
[sighs]

03:38.652 --> 03:41.053
[sighs]
oh, god.

03:45.158 --> 03:48.160
Is that paul?

03:48.162 --> 03:51.163
How long
has he been standing there?

03:51.165 --> 03:53.565
<i>Why is he awake</i>
<i>at this time of night?</i>

03:56.903 --> 03:58.503
Over half of it
was burnt.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.006
Csi's going through
what's left.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.341
You're up late.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.909
What's going on?
Why are you back?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.510
You wanted
up-to-the-minute.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.879
You should expect
to see a lot of us.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.081
Someone lit a boat
on fire

04:09.083 --> 04:10.182
Out in the harbor
late last night.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.717
<i>But it's not mine,</i>

04:11.719 --> 04:12.851
<i>'cause mine's still</i>
<i>in the marina</i>

04:12.853 --> 04:14.186
Under close watch.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.355
Also, we're holding
a public meeting

04:16.357 --> 04:17.422
At the school at noon,

04:17.424 --> 04:18.724
Fill in the town
on where we are.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.058
I'll let people
ask questions,

04:20.060 --> 04:21.360
But none of you
needs to be there.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.694
Is the press coming?

04:22.696 --> 04:23.862
(ellie)
we haven't asked them.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.863
Why not?
Chloe.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.231
I just--I don't understand

04:26.233 --> 04:28.033
Why there's not more
being written.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.702
Even in the <i>journal</i> today,
like, six lines on page four.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.204
It's like danny
doesn't even matter.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.739
I wouldn't
judge this investigation

04:33.741 --> 04:35.040
By what's in the press.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.242
I think
what we're all wondering

04:37.244 --> 04:39.077
Is if there were
more in the papers,

04:39.079 --> 04:40.579
Wouldn't it
jog people's memories?

04:40.581 --> 04:43.215
If that hiker's picture
was printed--

04:43.217 --> 04:44.216
We've been talking
about that--

04:44.218 --> 04:45.917
We want pierson to reappear.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.552
<i>If he sees</i>
<i>his face in the papers,</i>

04:47.554 --> 04:49.554
<i>What are the chances</i>
<i>he reveals himself?</i>

04:49.556 --> 04:51.156
Let us handle the media.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.927
Morning.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.095
Ugh!

04:57.097 --> 04:58.897
There's a woman
in my apartment.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.299
Is that a rare
occurrence?

05:00.301 --> 05:03.068
Let's just say the choices
in gracepoint are--

05:03.070 --> 05:04.569
Well, maybe they feel
the same way about you.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.104
I'm sure they do.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.139
Come here for a sec.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.340
What is it?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.414
Did you just find this?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.416
Yeah.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.584
Could be worth
looking into.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.420
Yeah.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.923
I know you've got that
solano girl here most weekends,

05:24.925 --> 05:28.760
But she can't be
much use to you these days.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.595
Well, I've been trying
to give her some time.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.598
Or I could pick up shifts
in the kitchen, wash dishes--

05:33.600 --> 05:36.435
Business has been really
dragging lately, so--

05:36.437 --> 05:39.771
You got that detective
staying here, don't you?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.107
I really appreciate
you dropping by.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.608
I will keep hold of this,

05:43.610 --> 05:47.646
And maybe I can call you
if business picks up.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.181
You do that.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.454
This it?

05:55.456 --> 05:56.621
Good morning.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.290
How you doing?
I've told him.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.858
It makes
absolutely no difference.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.126
Talk to me about the boat.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.794
Well, it was doused
in gasoline.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.629
The seawater
eventually put out the fire.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.198
But if they took it out at,
say, 4:00 a.M. To burn it,

06:06.200 --> 06:07.966
How did they get back?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.635
Rear section has marks
where a motor might've been.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.637
Could've used that
to get back on another boat.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.206
Or could be
they just towed it.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.308
Any hint
why they burned it?

06:16.310 --> 06:18.310
Take a look
at this piece.

06:18.312 --> 06:21.713
We sent samples off
for analysis.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.982
Check in the grain.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.484
Strands of hair.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.386
100 bucks says
that's the boat they used

06:27.388 --> 06:29.988
And those hairs
belong to danny solano.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.224
They're panicking, miller;
starting to show themselves.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.725
That's exactly what we want.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.827
That's an amateur move,
burning it like that.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.229
Come on, miller.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.398
This guy's got work to do.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.070
<i>(man)</i>
<i>I was just at the pier.</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:48.840
There's a forensics van there,
more police tape--

06:48.842 --> 06:50.342
New evidence
has come in overnight,

06:50.344 --> 06:53.011
And we have to examine it
without disruption.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.013
Was that the boat
that was on fire last night?

06:55.015 --> 06:57.349
<i>My brother saw it</i>
<i>when he was out with his traps.</i>

06:57.351 --> 07:00.185
It's too early to talk about
specific types of evidence.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.053
[whispers] find out the real
answer to that question.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.256
Who is the young fellow
in the photo,

07:04.258 --> 07:06.191
The one you've been
showing around?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.526
A person of interest.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.860
I'm not prepared
to say more than that.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.362
<i>You said</i>

07:10.364 --> 07:13.365
The tents on the beach'd
come down any day.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.367
This is our livelihood
you're stomping on.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.068
You have to understand
that every grain of sand

07:17.070 --> 07:18.870
Has to be sifted.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.540
Every stray hair,
every shard of plastic,

07:21.542 --> 07:23.542
Fingernail, toenail,

07:23.544 --> 07:25.710
Every piece of skin
has to be tested.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.379
A crime scene on a beach

07:27.381 --> 07:28.780
Is one of the very toughest

07:28.782 --> 07:30.048
For our officers
to deal with.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.550
We'll do
everything we can

07:31.552 --> 07:33.051
To minimize the effects
on your business.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.120
I hope so.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.722
<i>No one here</i>
<i>wants the name gracepoint</i>

07:37.724 --> 07:40.125
<i>To become just</i>
<i>another word for murder.</i>

07:41.561 --> 07:42.727
(raymond)
I told you there was a boat.

07:42.729 --> 07:43.762
Are you kidding me?

07:43.764 --> 07:44.763
Half of gracepoint
owns a boat.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.399
Did you look for it?

07:47.401 --> 07:49.401
Does beth solano know
that you didn't follow up

07:49.403 --> 07:50.402
On the information
that I gave you?

07:50.404 --> 07:51.603
No, no, no.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.737
You didn't give me
any information.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.139
You took a guess.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.242
Do not get involved
or you will live to regret it.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.643
Go home.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.314
<i>(kathy)</i>
<i>ellie.</i>
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>yeah.</i>

08:02.316 --> 08:04.249
Will you pass a message
to beth and mark?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.484
Whenever they feel
able to talk,

08:05.486 --> 08:06.485
Please come to us,
to me.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.786
We'll do things properly.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.654
Uh...Okay,
I'll let them know.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.157
Longer this goes on,

08:12.159 --> 08:13.592
The more everyone
wants to stick their nose in.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.826
I know.
People are getting restless.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.428
Too many opinions.
I don't like it.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.163
Detective carver.
Oh, terrific.
You two

08:18.165 --> 08:19.664
Have found each other.
That warmeth the heart.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.166
There's something owen found

08:21.168 --> 08:22.434
We think you both
need to know about.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.469
Here we go again.
We did some digging

08:24.471 --> 08:26.004
On jack reinhold
from the kayak shop.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.606
He's lived here for years,

08:27.608 --> 08:29.107
But nobody really knows
anything about him.

08:29.109 --> 08:33.445
Turns out he was in prison
before he moved here.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.946
He was convicted.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.181
Sex with a minor.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.454
(emmett)
take a seat.

08:42.456 --> 08:43.955
(jack)
thank you.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.857
[clears throat]

08:48.794 --> 08:51.129
Is this about
the, uh, backpacker,

08:51.131 --> 08:53.031
The one who was
talking with danny?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.967
Our backpacker
is still mia.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.437
Tell us about your conviction
for statutory rape, jack.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.475
Getting a bit desperate,
are we?

09:03.477 --> 09:05.977
Just trying
to establish the facts.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.712
You didn't mention it
when we spoke.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.815
Because it's got nothing to do
with anybody,

09:10.817 --> 09:13.552
Nothing to do with danny.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.320
You run
the wildlife club.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.188
That requires
a criminal background check

09:17.190 --> 09:19.824
Cross-referenced with
the sex offenders registry.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.861
Yeah,
but I'm not a sex offender.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.830
That trial was a farce,
and I'm not on any registry.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.500
Only because it happened before
the registry got started.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.535
[laughing]
oh.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.837
You should've
just declared it, jack.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.540
What, ellie,
when I first come to town,

09:35.542 --> 09:37.709
I should've
made a little sign?

09:37.711 --> 09:40.545
Fyi: Ex-convict?

09:40.547 --> 09:42.213
No.
No.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.549
I was trying to
get away from that,

09:44.551 --> 09:45.617
And I did.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.223
20 years

09:52.225 --> 09:54.192
And no complaints.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.495
I'm not what
you're insinuating.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.267
Jack, when did you last see
danny solano?

10:02.269 --> 10:06.304
A full day
before his body was found.

10:08.741 --> 10:12.410
He showed up
in the morning

10:12.412 --> 10:14.579
And did his log as usual.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.914
What about the night
of danny's death?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.215
Where were you then?

10:17.217 --> 10:19.050
I was in on my own
reading a book.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.051
Anyone vouch for that?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.286
Only the book.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.421
Which book?
<i>Infinite jest.</i>

10:23.423 --> 10:24.823
You might not like it.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.159
Hardly any pictures.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.329
We hear you
like photography.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.369
You take a lot of pictures
of the boys in your group?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.941
[sighs]

10:42.943 --> 10:45.443
I pity you,

10:45.445 --> 10:49.147
Seeing depravity
in perfectly normal behavior.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.917
If you have
an accusation

10:52.919 --> 10:55.120
Or any real evidence,

10:55.122 --> 10:56.521
Let's hear it.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.859
Otherwise,
I've got work to do.

11:17.943 --> 11:19.277
That was quick.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.779
Yeah, I left my cell.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.280
You manage to
get an answer out of carver

11:22.282 --> 11:23.448
On the combustible boat?

11:23.450 --> 11:24.949
No, not yet,
but I will.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.117
I thought you were asking him
in the school.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.619
Just give me one hour.

11:27.621 --> 11:28.653
Simple question.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.121
Are you too busy?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.623
One hour,
that's all I'm asking for.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.291
60 minutes, and then
I will answer your query,

11:33.293 --> 11:35.293
And I think I might actually
have something else for you.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.628
Something to do
with danny solano?

11:36.630 --> 11:38.630
Maybe.

11:38.632 --> 11:39.631
Last I checked,
I was your editor.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.299
You're not just my editor.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.468
You're my mentor, my idol,
font of knowledge and patience.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.469
I love you.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.371
Get out of here.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.472
Hey.
Hi.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.640
After you.
Thank you.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.975
Yeah.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.043
Ready?

11:54.313 --> 11:55.480
No comment.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.881
Hey, have you
got a minute?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.316
What's up?

11:58.318 --> 11:59.984
So susan wright,

11:59.986 --> 12:01.653
I think she lives
over the trailer park.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.354
Short and scowly,
german shepherd?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.656
Yeah, that's her.

12:04.658 --> 12:05.990
Or at least
I think it's her.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.325
She stopped by the inn
this morning

12:07.327 --> 12:08.393
Looking for
some cleaning work.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.561
Okay.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.895
She brought up
chloe solano.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.397
She was hoping
to pick up her hours.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.832
I gave her
an application.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.734
When I ran her
social security number,

12:15.736 --> 12:19.671
A different name
came up.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.573
Ruth erlick.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.408
Strange, right?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.577
Yeah.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.246
Thank you.
Welcome.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.749
(vince)
you know, I got some venison
in the freezer.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.251
You should let me cook
for you guys.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.522
You know, like a Sunday lunch
or something.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.157
All right, try it now.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.427
Yep, there it goes.
Oh.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.062
[laughs]
all right.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.363
Thanks, boss.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.433
I can never get
this damn thing to work.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.000
Hmm.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.205
How'd this get
down there?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.441
Ah, jeez.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.542
My ma, you know?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.611
You never know.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.379
Did you clog the sink
on purpose?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.047
No, why--why
would I do that?

13:03.049 --> 13:04.949
I don't know.
Keep me busy?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.484
Take my mind off things?

13:09.889 --> 13:11.422
[clears throat]

13:11.424 --> 13:14.058
Look, why don't you let me
cook for you guys, huh?

13:14.060 --> 13:16.227
You still got to eat,
right?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.962
How many times
have you fed us?

13:21.233 --> 13:25.737
I know it's never gonna be
the same, all right, but...

13:25.739 --> 13:27.739
You're a good man,
vince.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.741
A good man.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.643
I appreciate all the--

13:31.645 --> 13:33.077
All the work
you've been doing,

13:33.079 --> 13:34.579
And the extra work.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.416
And just...

13:38.418 --> 13:42.253
I've been meaning
to give you that.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.822
60 bucks.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.089
I mean, it's not much,
but--

13:45.091 --> 13:46.424
Well, look.
Why--why don't you--

13:46.426 --> 13:47.926
Why don't you
hold on to it?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.260
Then when all this
is in the past,

13:49.262 --> 13:52.430
We can have
a real conversation

13:52.432 --> 13:54.165
About that promotion.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.339
I'm gonna ask beth
about Sunday.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.846
(beth)
hey, come on in.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.689
This is what you called us
back here for?

14:17.691 --> 14:18.690
Tell them.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.124
Danny wants to tell people

14:20.126 --> 14:21.626
That he was killed
by someone he knew.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.627
All right,
this is offensive.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.862
I'm ending this right now.

14:23.864 --> 14:24.863
No, raymond
knew about the boat.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.197
He says that he told you.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.198
You didn't listen.
Listen to what?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.700
Just hear him out, please.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.301
Go ahead.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.304
Beth, we checked into
mr. Connelly's background.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.139
He's declared bankruptcy
twice.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.307
No, no.
Wait a second.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.676
He has prior convictions
for theft

14:38.678 --> 14:40.311
And conspiracy
to commit fraud.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.813
What?
(raymond)
wait a second.

14:41.815 --> 14:42.814
Out, now.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.015
That has got nothing to--

14:44.017 --> 14:45.884
That has got
nothing to do with this!

14:47.486 --> 14:49.387
You're a moron
for letting him in.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.824
Get up.

14:52.826 --> 14:55.360
I don't know if you're
mentally ill, a liar,

14:55.362 --> 14:56.828
Or someone who actually believes
they're telling the truth.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.663
I don't care.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.832
My job is to find this killer
and prove my case in court.

15:00.834 --> 15:01.833
Let go of me.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.001
I deal in facts.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.836
All you've given her
is fantasy.

15:04.838 --> 15:07.505
Now, pete is gonna follow you
as you drive

15:07.507 --> 15:09.507
Very far away
from this house.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.342
Final warning.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.177
I see you again...

15:13.179 --> 15:14.679
I will lock you up.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.180
[grunts]
[thud]

15:16.182 --> 15:17.382
(beth)
why would he do this, ellie?

15:17.384 --> 15:18.683
<i>What does he have to gain?</i>

15:18.685 --> 15:20.184
I haven't paid him
anything.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.520
I know, but two weeks
from now--two weeks from now,

15:22.522 --> 15:25.523
He goes to the press,
and he gives them an exclusive.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.359
Six months from now,
he writes his memoir.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.061
"how I worked to solve

15:30.063 --> 15:35.066
The gracepoint
child murder case."

15:35.068 --> 15:37.702
I am so alone in this.

15:37.704 --> 15:38.903
Have you talked
to mark yet?

15:38.905 --> 15:41.706
No.
No, I can't.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.408
Beth...

15:43.410 --> 15:44.776
You have to.

16:00.392 --> 16:03.628
[no sound]

16:05.731 --> 16:07.966
You sure
your family's okay with it?

16:07.968 --> 16:10.401
Have you checked
with your mom?

16:10.403 --> 16:12.403
Okay, good.
I'll see you soon.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.471
Sustenance.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.639
Thank you.
Yeah.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.640
Me hungry isn't good.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.575
I promise you.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.444
So listen,
I was thinking

16:19.446 --> 16:21.913
We should probably
talk to jack reinhold,

16:21.915 --> 16:24.248
Get his side of the story
before we write anything.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.250
Mm-hmm,
sooner the better.

16:26.252 --> 16:29.754
Let's finish lunch,
and you'll go talk to him.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.422
You mean like alone?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.925
You saw the way he treated me.
I'm like vermin to him.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.426
This one's on you.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.929
I--[sighs]
I know the guy, though.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.098
I mean, I did
wildlife observation with him

16:40.100 --> 16:41.599
Till I was in,
like, sixth grade.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.602
Exactly why
he'll talk to you.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.505
I have something to do
anyways.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.374
You gonna tell me what?

16:50.642 --> 16:51.943
We sleep together once.

16:51.945 --> 16:54.779
You're already
keeping tabs on me?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.014
Eat and get on it.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.625
Thank you
for speaking to me.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.861
I'm not here
to pressure you.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.963
In fact, I've been
in town since day one,

17:11.965 --> 17:13.297
And I've left you alone.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.799
Yeah, it's true.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.801
I left one of danny's toys
at the beach,

17:16.803 --> 17:18.803
And she brought it back to me
so it wouldn't get stolen.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.972
Look, very simply,
I think danny's case

17:20.974 --> 17:22.473
Should be getting
more coverage.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.542
And you're here to help
with that?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.044
Well, you're not
gonna like hearing this,

17:26.046 --> 17:28.046
But part of the reason
your son's death

17:28.048 --> 17:29.814
Isn't getting the attention
it deserves is,

17:29.816 --> 17:31.149
He's not
the right profile.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.551
You know,
if danny were a girl,

17:33.553 --> 17:35.720
Blonde,
few years younger,

17:35.722 --> 17:37.655
This town would be
crawling with reporters.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.990
I hope you're kidding.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.892
I'm sorry I'm not.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.494
12-year-old boys...
People sometimes

17:43.496 --> 17:45.163
Don't really see them
as kids anymore, you know?

17:45.165 --> 17:49.000
They can get into vandalism,
steal things;

17:49.002 --> 17:50.835
If you want more focus
on this case,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.004
Beth, it's really
gonna come down to you.

17:53.006 --> 17:54.338
Me?
Why?

17:54.340 --> 17:56.174
You tell your side of things,

17:56.176 --> 17:58.576
Who your son really was,
how it's been for you,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.011
Every mom in the state
will respond.

18:00.013 --> 18:01.412
I don't know.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.849
Shouldn't we clear it
with the police?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.517
You can, absolutely.

18:06.519 --> 18:10.521
But I will say
they're being very cautious,

18:10.523 --> 18:12.190
Detective carver
in particular.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.192
He won't let anyone in the
department speak to the press.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.761
That doesn't stop
paul coates.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.229
Okay, well, what if

18:18.231 --> 18:19.931
She shows us
what she writes

18:19.933 --> 18:21.265
Before she
sends it in?

18:21.267 --> 18:25.369
Well, I don't normally
do that, but...

18:25.371 --> 18:26.871
Maybe this time,

18:26.873 --> 18:29.040
If you'd consider giving me

18:29.042 --> 18:30.975
A picture of you and danny
for the article.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.279
What do you think?

18:39.218 --> 18:40.885
Why don't we just
get back to you,

18:40.887 --> 18:41.953
Like, maybe tomorrow
or--

18:41.955 --> 18:43.788
Let's do it.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.961
What are we asking
the priest?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.229
He's one of the few
without an alibi

18:51.231 --> 18:52.296
The night
danny was killed.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.297
Know him well?

18:53.299 --> 18:55.399
A bit.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.734
He grew up here,

18:56.736 --> 19:00.238
But he's a lot
younger than me.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.739
[clears throat]

19:01.741 --> 19:03.141
That's where
you're supposed to say,

19:03.143 --> 19:05.743
"but he doesn't look it,
miller."

19:05.745 --> 19:07.078
Ah, missed my cue.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.412
Mm-hmm.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.581
Anyway, he left
right after high school.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.816
He's been back
two, three years.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.917
[knocks on door]

19:12.919 --> 19:14.418
Tom goes to
his Sunday school.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.120
So did danny.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.755
Ellie.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.424
Beth's family's
been coming here forever.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.260
You know,
mary is on our board.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.262
And you saw danny
at least once a week,

19:24.264 --> 19:25.930
Knew him really well.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.432
Well,
I wouldn't say really well.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.435
I mean, he was a good kid,
same as tom.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.104
<i>Does the priest</i>

19:33.106 --> 19:35.640
Normally teach
Sunday school?

19:35.642 --> 19:38.442
I thought that happened
during services.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.611
I've arranged
to have it afterwards.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.980
You know,
if I can personally convey

19:42.982 --> 19:46.117
Just a bit
of the comfort and joy

19:46.119 --> 19:48.452
My faith brings me
to the kids in the community,

19:48.454 --> 19:51.622
Then I think
all of gracepoint benefits.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.025
Where were you
on the night of danny's death?

19:54.027 --> 19:58.296
Like I told your officers,
in the rectory on my own.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.498
I was up late
trying to write a sermon.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.701
"trying"
being the operative word.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.304
Did you often
stay up late?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.973
Because I was
down on the corner

20:08.975 --> 20:10.641
At 4:00 a.M.
The other night,

20:10.643 --> 20:13.878
And I saw you
right outside the door there.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.879
Oh, was that you?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.314
Mm-hmm.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.815
Okay, um...

20:17.817 --> 20:21.485
Yeah, I have
terrible insomnia

20:21.487 --> 20:22.987
Off and on for years.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.822
I can't find anything
to cure it,

20:24.824 --> 20:27.992
So I get up, wander around.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.995
Anything specific
that triggered it this time?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.230
Not really, no.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.834
Were you up wandering
on that Thursday night?

20:36.836 --> 20:39.837
I don't--I don't think so.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.840
I mean, I could've gone outside
for some fresh air

20:42.842 --> 20:45.409
At some point,
but I don't remember.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.852
Susan, yes?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.188
You gonna tell me
I can't put this here?

20:57.190 --> 20:58.689
It's a public kiosk.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.691
Oh, go ahead.
I just wanted to say hello.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.527
I'm kathy.
I edit the <i>journal.</i>

21:03.529 --> 21:05.096
You sure you have
the right name on there?

21:05.098 --> 21:06.397
Is it susan

21:06.399 --> 21:08.366
Or ruth?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.934
Came across something
written about you

21:09.936 --> 21:11.736
From several years back
under a different name.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.372
Somebody must have
written it wrong.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.208
Wonder why
that would happen.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.909
I don't know
what you want with me.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.411
I got business to conduct.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.246
All right.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.282
Well, maybe we'll get a chance
to talk another time.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.483
I'll see you around.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.390
You ran track, really?

21:32.392 --> 21:35.059
Yeah, tough to believe
now, huh?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.460
What are you talking about?
You look great.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.062
[laughs]

21:38.064 --> 21:42.633
Well, anyway, I ran
middle distance, 800, 1,500.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.403
It's not so much about skill
as it is about grit.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.606
You learn to live
with the pain.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.175
Wish I could do that now.

21:54.079 --> 21:56.147
So did you ever think
about college?

21:56.149 --> 21:58.449
Yeah.
All was a time, actually.

21:58.451 --> 22:02.620
I had a scholarship
to portland state.

22:02.622 --> 22:06.424
Nice city, good school.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.426
But then I got pregnant

22:08.428 --> 22:10.328
And had my sweet chloe.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.003
Was mark
your first boyfriend?

22:21.440 --> 22:24.442
You are my strength
and shield.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.278
My heart trusts in you.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.782
May your wisdom save me
from false choices.

22:31.784 --> 22:35.186
In your straight path,
may I not stumble.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.627
That's nice work, justin.

22:43.629 --> 22:44.795
Hey, guys.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.464
Owen.
<i>Hey.</i>

22:46.466 --> 22:47.631
Hey, did you come to work?

22:47.633 --> 22:49.133
Ah, no, I, uh...

22:49.135 --> 22:50.701
Can I talk to you inside
for a sec?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.336
Well, I really
want to get this done,

22:52.338 --> 22:53.971
And, you know,
they're into it.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.973
So why,
what's going on?

22:55.975 --> 22:57.308
Um...

22:57.310 --> 22:59.810
I came across something,
and, you know,

22:59.812 --> 23:01.045
I've known you
for a long time,

23:01.047 --> 23:02.546
So I just wanted
to check with you

23:02.548 --> 23:04.048
Before it...

23:04.050 --> 23:06.217
Gets out.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.451
Gets out?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.721
What gets out?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.957
[chuckles] um...

23:14.893 --> 23:17.128
Do you have a conviction
for statutory rape?

23:20.899 --> 23:23.000
Where'd you get that
information from, the cops?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.235
No.
Is that right?

23:24.237 --> 23:25.736
I just wanted
to hear your side.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.505
Now what are you,
playing carver's game now?

23:27.507 --> 23:29.340
Really? Are you?
Huh?

23:29.342 --> 23:31.909
Just accusation, innuendo--
no.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.844
Just joking, no truth?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.846
Is that what it is?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.014
Huh?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.849
Take your hands off of me.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.018
How long have you known me?
All your life.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.588
When did I ever
do anything inappropriate?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.090
Huh?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.691
<i>Let's just go inside</i>
<i>and talk.</i>

23:47.693 --> 23:49.860
Owen burke,
you've changed.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.095
You're not the same person.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.431
You were a decent kid once,

23:53.433 --> 23:57.268
But now you're nothing
but a snake.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.270
Get out of here.
Get out!

23:59.272 --> 24:00.671
Get!

24:19.224 --> 24:20.624
Hello.
Hi.

24:20.626 --> 24:21.625
Please come in.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.561
Thank you.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.229
[ahem]
oh.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.731
You're in a suit.

24:27.733 --> 24:28.732
Is that bad?

24:28.734 --> 24:30.301
No, no.
It's fine.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.236
Why don't you
just come on in?

24:32.238 --> 24:33.771
Joe, emmett is here,

24:33.773 --> 24:35.239
And he has brought gifts

24:35.241 --> 24:37.575
Including chocolates
and wine

24:37.577 --> 24:39.577
And some beautiful flowers.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.413
I didn't know what to choose,
so I got them all.

24:42.415 --> 24:43.914
It's been a while
since I had a dinner invite.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.916
Well, thank you.

24:45.918 --> 24:46.917
Thank you.
Thank you.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.285
Thanks.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.421
I am calling you emmett
tonight, by the way.

24:50.423 --> 24:51.922
You can forget about carver.

24:51.924 --> 24:52.923
And sir.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.258
I mean, what am I gonna say?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.993
"have some guacamole, sir"?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.762
Yeah, I don't like emmett.
I've never liked emmett.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.265
Emmett.
It's better than joe.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.933
I don't get why everyone
has to use first names anyway,

25:02.935 --> 25:04.802
Like we're all in group therapy
or something.

25:04.804 --> 25:05.936
I mean, if I'm looking at a--
if I'm looking at you,

25:05.938 --> 25:07.505
You know I'm talking to you.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.273
I don't need to say your name
three times

25:09.275 --> 25:11.108
To congratulate myself
on remembering it,

25:11.110 --> 25:14.111
Like, to create some sort of--

25:14.113 --> 25:16.514
Whatever it is.
False intimacy, or...

25:20.118 --> 25:22.286
So how'd you two meet?

25:22.288 --> 25:24.121
On the job.
Um...

25:24.123 --> 25:27.291
Joe was
an amazing paramedic.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.792
Not anymore?

25:28.794 --> 25:30.628
I gave it up
when dylan came along.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.463
He's also an amazing father.

25:32.465 --> 25:33.864
[scoffs]
what?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.299
I was getting fed up
with it anyway.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.467
Fed up how?

25:36.469 --> 25:37.968
Don't get me started.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.336
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>You married?</i>

25:39.338 --> 25:41.138
This is great food.
You make this yourself?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.540
Mexican is joe's specialty.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.041
Oh, I should've done
margaritas.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.142
Oh, yeah,
you should've.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.310
No.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.344
Not married.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.647
Not anymore.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.315
Oh, that's too bad.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.984
Yeah, well, we were fighting.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.020
We moved out to rosemont

25:56.022 --> 25:58.589
To be near her family,
and then...

26:02.661 --> 26:03.661
I don't know.

26:03.663 --> 26:07.031
Well, in-laws, work stress.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.065
Partly.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.567
This job can do that to you.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.001
Ooh, let's hope not.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.770
No, I didn't--
you have any kids?

26:14.506 --> 26:17.041
A daughter,

26:17.043 --> 26:19.243
17,
lives with her mother.

26:20.378 --> 26:23.547
That must be tough.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.182
You think
you're gonna solve this case?

26:25.184 --> 26:26.717
Joe--

26:26.719 --> 26:27.718
Absolutely.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.186
Good.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.790
I'm gonna, um, excuse
myself for a second.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.727
No more work talk.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.795
Okay?

26:42.233 --> 26:43.233
Oh, no.
No more.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.269
Oh, shut up and drink.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.877
Does she like me?

26:53.879 --> 26:55.045
Sorry?

26:55.047 --> 26:58.115
Does she like
working with me?

26:58.117 --> 27:01.885
I mean, you're here
for dinner, aren't you?

27:01.887 --> 27:03.287
I think I irritate her.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.290
Oh, she hasn't
mentioned anything.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.225
You're a terrible liar.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.060
You're a terrible boss.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.061
I knew it.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.229
[laughter]

27:12.231 --> 27:13.230
Touche.

27:13.232 --> 27:17.735

27:17.737 --> 27:19.403

27:19.405 --> 27:20.638

27:21.740 --> 27:22.740
What's so funny?

27:22.742 --> 27:23.807
[coughs]

27:27.078 --> 27:28.579
(julianne)
hey, this is julianne.

27:28.581 --> 27:30.247
Leave a message,
and we'll talk soon.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.248
Bye.
[beep]

27:31.250 --> 27:33.083
Hey, it's me,

27:33.085 --> 27:36.253
Checking in
with your voice mail as usual.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.755
It's been a really long time
this time.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.324
I know you're busy
with swimming and school

27:40.326 --> 27:43.427
And all the other stuff you do,

27:43.429 --> 27:46.096
But I do think of you.

27:46.098 --> 27:50.934
If you want we could video chat,
whatever it's called, maybe...

27:50.936 --> 27:54.772
Before you forget
what I look like.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.273
Anyway, that's it.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.341
This is dad.

27:59.444 --> 28:00.844
Please try me.

[keyboard keys clacking]

28:23.535 --> 28:24.768

28:47.058 --> 28:49.560
Why are you
so interested in me?

28:50.662 --> 28:52.162
How did you get in here?

28:52.164 --> 28:55.566
What's my life
got to do with you?

28:57.402 --> 29:01.905
You're gonna stop
asking questions about me.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.543
Why would I do that?

29:06.545 --> 29:09.279
I know men who'd rape you.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.360
Night, detective.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.428
Night.

<i>Two stitches.</i>

29:58.396 --> 30:00.230
The nurse has more percocet
if you need it.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.633
What am I doing here?

30:02.635 --> 30:04.234
What are you doing here?

30:04.236 --> 30:05.569
Well, you passed out.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.304
I found you
on the bedroom floor.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.973
What were you doing
in my bedroom?

30:09.975 --> 30:11.742
Well, the guest
underneath your room

30:11.744 --> 30:16.079
Heard the crash
and called down, luckily.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.614
Is this your daughter?

30:17.616 --> 30:18.916
Where'd you find that?

30:18.918 --> 30:20.818
Oh, I was looking for
next of kin

30:20.820 --> 30:22.586
In the ambulance.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.422
Couldn't find any,
so I told them I was your wife.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.758
You did what?

30:27.760 --> 30:29.159
You could do worse.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.829
So I'm glad that
you're good,

30:31.831 --> 30:33.430
But I really do
need to get back,

30:33.432 --> 30:35.599
In case, by some miracle,
I have customers.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.601
You can't tell anyone
about this.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.837
If they find out I'm sick,
they'll take me off the case.

30:42.106 --> 30:44.341
Gemma,
I need to stay on this case.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.946
On one condition.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.614
You listen
to the doctors,

30:50.616 --> 30:52.783
And you get
some proper help,

30:52.785 --> 30:54.785
Because no one might
find you next time.

30:54.787 --> 30:55.953
I'm coming with you.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.020
They want you
to stay here.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.956
I don't care.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.625
What's this?

31:01.627 --> 31:03.293
Oh, god.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.896
I thought
that might interest you.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.776
(ellie)
why did she do this?

31:55.847 --> 31:57.214
Doesn't seem
so bad to me.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.716
But we told her not to.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.752
I got to go.

32:01.754 --> 32:02.986
See you later.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.591
Hey.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.360
I was thinking of taking
tom to church this morning.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.895
Church?

32:11.897 --> 32:13.363
Yeah.
Why?

32:13.365 --> 32:14.765
I ran into paul coates,

32:14.767 --> 32:16.900
And he said he was hoping
people would show up.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.368
Time of need.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.337
I don't know.
Might be nice.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.440
Hey, you.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.574
I thought I would've heard
from you earlier.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.243
<i>(owen)</i>
<i>it's 8:00 a.M.</i>

32:26.245 --> 32:27.444
Did you read it?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.746
Yeah.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.581
(renee)
and that's all?

32:31.583 --> 32:33.550
What do you want me to say?
It's a great piece.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.385
I really felt beth's misery.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.621
Made me wonder what you meant
by "shared byline."

32:37.623 --> 32:40.290
Owen--
(owen)
<i>so you send me off</i>

32:40.292 --> 32:41.725
To question jack
'cause you got something better?

32:41.727 --> 32:44.761
Something I knew
could help both of us.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.596
The rest of the papers
are scrambling.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.898
This town
could be packed tomorrow

32:47.900 --> 32:49.266
With you and me
ahead of everyone.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.735
[scoffs]
you and me, right.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.470
My editor is asking
for a follow-up.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.639
Your jack reinhold piece
is next.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.808
I already spoke to kathy.
I told her we had something.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.309
Well, tell her we don't.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.780
I got to go.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.415
Hey, what are you doing
with that?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.650
Mom, what--

33:08.753 --> 33:10.320
They taking everything?

33:10.322 --> 33:12.589
It's all a mistake
anyway.

33:12.591 --> 33:16.760
You said
you were gonna stop.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.262
You need to stop.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.164
Don't give me that face.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.667
You look like your father
when you do that.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.108
Don't tell me
you're going too.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.110
Yeah, ma wanted to pray.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.444
You here alone?

33:34.446 --> 33:37.681
Yeah. All the, uh,
women found religion.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.282
You know what?
I bet you our savior paul

33:39.284 --> 33:41.952
Is just loving this attention.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.154
Keep it covered
in the oven at 250.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.023
It'll stay warm
till we get back.

33:46.025 --> 33:49.292
Look, mark,
I got to tell you something.

33:49.294 --> 33:52.662
Yesterday, I saw owen
talking to jack reinhold,

33:52.664 --> 33:54.531
Asking him some questions.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.300
And from what I heard,

33:57.302 --> 34:00.370
He's got a history with kids,

34:00.372 --> 34:01.938
Some pretty nasty stuff.

34:13.484 --> 34:14.484
Good morning, sir.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.520
I--holy crap.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.988
What happened to you?

34:17.990 --> 34:19.156
Oh, I slipped in the shower
last night.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.158
You seen the <i>globe?</i>

34:21.160 --> 34:22.726
Yeah, I did.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.494
I don't know when the solanos
decided to--

34:24.496 --> 34:26.163
They've opened
the floodgates.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.998
Desk sergeant's been deluged
with media requests.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.499
I'm calling a press conference
for tonight.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.001
The family needs
to make a statement.

34:31.003 --> 34:33.503
In the meantime,
I need full background checks

34:33.505 --> 34:35.005
On jack reinhold,

34:35.007 --> 34:36.673
Raymond connelly,
and paul coates.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.509
Anyone without an alibi
goes to the top of our list.

34:39.511 --> 34:40.610
All right.

34:42.346 --> 34:44.748
<i>Sir, on the backpacker,</i>
<i>I can see--</i>

34:44.750 --> 34:46.183
No, we can't release
his picture.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.185
No, not to the media.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.020
I thought if we gave it
to the park service.

34:50.022 --> 34:51.555
<i>There's a very</i>
<i>strong chance</i>

34:51.557 --> 34:53.423
<i>He's going</i>
<i>campsite to campsite.</i>

34:53.425 --> 34:55.358
I know you think I'm still
pushing the outsider thing--

34:55.360 --> 34:56.860
No, you're right.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.128
You're right.
Go ahead.

34:59.864 --> 35:00.931
Thank you.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.236
Could I ask one more favor?

35:06.238 --> 35:08.705
I was thinking
about going to church today.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.541
Ah.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.377
Everyone all together,
opportunity to...

35:14.379 --> 35:15.712
Check on
who's acting strangely?

35:15.714 --> 35:17.814
That was not--

35:19.383 --> 35:21.284
Uh...Never mind.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.743
Ellie.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.911
Come to lunch today.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.913
Vince is cooking.

35:49.915 --> 35:50.914
You sure?

35:50.916 --> 35:51.915
Yeah, please.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.917
Like old times.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.152
Thank you, beth.
Of course.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.596
Hi, husband.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.099
How's your head?

36:09.101 --> 36:10.934
I didn't know
he was religious.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.436
I didn't know
we were either.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.405
Good point.

36:24.448 --> 36:26.116
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

36:26.118 --> 36:29.786
It is good to see
so many of you here today.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.489
<i>I'm reminded of 1st timothy.</i>

36:32.491 --> 36:34.124
<i>"this is good,</i>

36:34.126 --> 36:37.460
"and it is pleasing in the sight

<i>Who desires all people</i>
<i>to be saved."</i>

36:40.699 --> 36:42.165
<i>I'm going to ask you</i>

36:42.167 --> 36:45.302
<i>To look around</i>
<i>at your families,</i>

36:45.304 --> 36:48.205
<i>Your friends,</i>
<i>the members of your community.</i>

36:48.207 --> 36:49.973
<i>Ask yourself:</i>

36:49.975 --> 36:52.309
<i>Do you look at them</i>
<i>with suspicion?</i>

36:52.311 --> 36:55.312
<i>Do you?</i>
<i>Now look at yourself.</i>

36:55.314 --> 36:59.182
Why do you see the speck
that is in your brother's eye

36:59.184 --> 37:02.686
But do not notice
the beam that is in your own?

37:02.688 --> 37:06.189
<i>It is so easy to stir hatred,</i>

37:06.191 --> 37:08.825
<i>To cast suspicion.</i>

37:08.827 --> 37:11.361
Shame on those
who come to gracepoint

37:11.363 --> 37:14.030
To stir bitterness and turmoil,

37:14.032 --> 37:17.033
To turn neighbor
against neighbor,

37:17.035 --> 37:18.835
<i>And shame on us,</i>

37:18.837 --> 37:20.036
All of us,

37:20.038 --> 37:21.638
For allowing it to happen.

37:30.047 --> 37:32.349
I got the booster seat
for dylan.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.783
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>oh, thank you, mary.</i>

37:43.427 --> 37:44.561
Poor bambi.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.096
[laughs]
quit saying that.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.430
It smells good
in here.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.698
It's bambi bourguignon.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.700
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.402
<i>You're not getting any.</i>

37:52.404 --> 37:53.536

37:53.538 --> 37:55.372
Oh, nice.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.539
Nice.

37:56.541 --> 37:57.741
All right.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.209
All right.
Now you got to kick it.

37:59.211 --> 38:01.111
We're gonna kick it.
Ah! That was a goal!

38:02.213 --> 38:03.446
No.
Oh, hey.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.551
Everything all right?

38:08.553 --> 38:10.620
Food's almost done.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.106
You okay, sweetie?

39:03.108 --> 39:04.674
Yeah.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.743
Um, are you?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.283
Can I ask you something?

39:13.285 --> 39:15.285
You can say no.

39:15.287 --> 39:16.753
Okay.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.091
Can I have a hug?

39:25.296 --> 39:26.363
[laughs]

39:28.532 --> 39:30.033
[whimpers]

39:30.035 --> 39:31.601
I miss his hugs.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.373
[knock at door]

39:36.375 --> 39:38.441
[sighs]
better get that.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.482
(jack)
hey, beth.
Is mark here?

39:45.484 --> 39:47.150
Hey, mark?

39:47.152 --> 39:48.651
<i>Mark?</i>

39:48.653 --> 39:49.652
Hi, jack.

39:49.654 --> 39:50.854
Hi.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.823
Beth, mark,
I was in one of the kayaks,

39:53.825 --> 39:55.492
Look, and I found
something.

39:55.494 --> 39:58.561
It was back
in the holding hatch,

39:58.563 --> 40:00.397
And I found this.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.834
That's danny's phone.
(jack)
he must've left it.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.202
Uh, mark,
please hand that to me.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.904
You really just found this?
Yeah.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.840
Mark, beth, they're gonna say
things about me,

40:10.842 --> 40:12.008
And none of it's true.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.343
Jack--
well, what kind of things?

40:13.345 --> 40:14.511
Let's not
do this now.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.712
Please,
you got to believe me.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.247
(jack)
things happened before.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.915
They're gonna say
that I did it,

40:18.917 --> 40:20.517
But I'm looking you
in the eye,

40:20.519 --> 40:22.185
And I'm looking
beth in the eye

40:22.187 --> 40:23.753
Because he was your son...
(ellie)
jack--

40:23.755 --> 40:26.523
And I'm telling you
I didn't do it.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.857
I didn't.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.592
I'm not
that kind of man.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.727
You have to believe me.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.028
Jack.
No, wait.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.863
Hey, stop it.
That's enough.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.098
Please.
Come on.

40:38.035 --> 40:39.436
Hey, man.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.104
Give me that camera, man.
It's cool.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.105
(joe)
mark!

40:42.107 --> 40:43.373
Hey, man, get off me.

40:43.375 --> 40:44.374
Get off me!

40:44.376 --> 40:45.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:45.377 --> 40:47.210
No!

40:47.212 --> 40:49.045
[glass shatters]

40:49.047 --> 40:50.380
Get out of here.
What the hell!

40:50.382 --> 40:51.381
Get the hell out of here!

40:51.383 --> 40:52.882

40:52.884 --> 40:55.084

<i>Get inside.</i>

<i>(vince)</i>
<i>what the hell are you doing?</i>
<i>Get out of here! Get out!</i>

41:11.068 --> 41:12.769
Why do they
need all of us?

41:12.771 --> 41:17.073
To make people understand
how much danny meant to us,

41:17.075 --> 41:20.076
<i>How strong a family we are.</i>

41:20.078 --> 41:21.077
(emmett)
okay.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.479
You ready for this?

41:23.581 --> 41:25.248
So...

41:25.250 --> 41:26.749
Chloe,
you're at the far end,

41:26.751 --> 41:28.251
And then beth
and then mark.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.919
Okay.
Okay.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.922
[camera shutters clicking]

41:32.924 --> 41:35.492
I know about you
and gemma fisher.

41:40.764 --> 41:42.165
Mark, now.

41:56.447 --> 41:57.947
Csi confirmed.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.516
The hairs in the boat,
they match danny's.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.117
I thought they would.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.620
Also something just came in
from the oregon state police

42:03.622 --> 42:06.623
About a death on the cliffs
at cannon beach 15 years back.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.124
They've seen the details

42:08.126 --> 42:09.959
And think it has similarities
to our case.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.528
Okay, tell me later.
No, sir.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.863
Jack reinhold
used to live in arch cape,

42:13.865 --> 42:16.099
5 miles from cannon beach.

42:30.147 --> 42:31.981
Good evening.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.550
Thank you for coming.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.485
<i>We're going to start</i>
<i>with a statement</i>

42:35.487 --> 42:37.987
From danny's mother,
beth solano,

42:37.989 --> 42:40.990
And then
we'll open to questions.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.559
Mrs. Solano.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.666
Mark, chloe, and I

42:49.668 --> 42:52.068
Want to say thank you

42:52.070 --> 42:54.170
To the gracepoint police

42:54.172 --> 42:57.040
And to the community

42:57.042 --> 43:00.944
For all of the support
you have shown us.

43:04.181 --> 43:05.715
To danny's killer,

43:05.717 --> 43:09.886
You should
know that we are suffering.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.388
Every day that goes by,

43:12.390 --> 43:14.190
It gets harder,

43:14.192 --> 43:17.860
Not easier.

43:17.862 --> 43:20.229
We ask you to please,

43:20.231 --> 43:23.900
Please come forward

43:23.902 --> 43:27.136
And put an end
to this terrible time.
