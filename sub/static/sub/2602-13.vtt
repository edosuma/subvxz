WEBVTT

00:01.681 --> 00:03.689
Charles, this is exciting.

00:03.690 --> 00:06.123
- Medal of valor.
- I know.

00:06.124 --> 00:07.224
For getting shot
in the butt.

00:09.361 --> 00:12.396
Oh, my butt!

00:12.397 --> 00:13.898
For exceptional acts
of heroism

00:13.899 --> 00:15.799
or voluntary risk
of personal safety.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.434
But, you know, six of one.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.904
This is one of
the NYPD's highest honors.

00:19.905 --> 00:23.774
Today is your day,
Detective Boyle.

00:23.808 --> 00:25.976
Heroism can't be
measured by a piece of metal.

00:25.977 --> 00:27.177
But what else can we do

00:27.212 --> 00:29.213
to recognize
the brave officers

00:29.214 --> 00:31.181
that have put their
lives on the line?

00:31.216 --> 00:34.285
It is my great honor to present
the medal of valor

00:34.286 --> 00:38.122
to Detective
Charles Boyle...

00:38.156 --> 00:40.424
And sergeant
peanut butter.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.434
Oh, my God.

00:50.435 --> 00:52.036
Charles is getting
the same medal as a horse.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.171
At least Boyle
was announced first.

00:54.172 --> 00:55.806
Because the horse
outranks him.

00:55.807 --> 00:57.007
This is amazing.

00:57.008 --> 00:58.742
That's enough, Peralta.

00:58.777 --> 00:59.977
<i>This is a huge honor,</i>

00:59.978 --> 01:01.412
<i>and nothing can take that
away from him.</i>

01:01.446 --> 01:03.414
The horse is pooping
on the stage.

01:03.415 --> 01:05.382
Sergeant peanut butter
is pooping on the stage.

Peralta.

01:30.408 --> 01:31.541
Santiago.

01:31.542 --> 01:32.576
The bet ends today.

01:32.577 --> 01:34.278
Are you ready?
I was born ready.

01:34.312 --> 01:35.579
To lose?
The whole question was,

01:35.580 --> 01:36.580
"are you ready to lose?"

01:36.581 --> 01:37.881
And you said
you were born that way.

01:37.916 --> 01:39.082
Twist my words
all you want.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.584
Okay.
I'm winning this bet.

01:40.585 --> 01:41.718
- No.
-  <i>What bet?</i>

01:41.719 --> 01:42.719
<i>What are you guys
talking about?</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:44.288
Seriously?
The bet?

01:44.322 --> 01:45.722
They've been keeping score
all year.

01:45.723 --> 01:46.723
It comes up
all the time.

01:46.724 --> 01:48.425
What are you doing
all day?

01:48.426 --> 01:50.327
Nothing.
Why, you wanna hang out?

01:50.361 --> 01:52.262
<i>A year ago today,
Peralta and I made a bet</i>

01:52.263 --> 01:53.931
to prove who's
a better Detective.

01:53.932 --> 01:56.400
Whoever makes more
felony arrests, wins.

01:56.434 --> 01:57.768
What are the stakes?

01:57.769 --> 02:00.570
And don't say money,
because I know you're in debt.

02:00.605 --> 02:02.539
If you really knew
anything about me,

02:02.540 --> 02:03.941
you would've said
"crushing debt,"

02:03.942 --> 02:05.175
and I'll bet whatever,

02:05.176 --> 02:06.410
'cause there's no way
I'm losing.

02:06.444 --> 02:08.645
What about your car?
Oh!

02:08.680 --> 02:10.047
That thing
is a date magnet.

02:10.048 --> 02:12.449
I mean, how many girls have you
made out with in that car?

02:12.450 --> 02:15.118
Six?
Well, I'm gonna win, so sure.

02:15.119 --> 02:17.154
Let's bet the car.

02:17.188 --> 02:18.322
Yes.

02:18.356 --> 02:19.356
<i>No, Jakey, no!</i>

02:19.357 --> 02:20.757
<i>That car
is your superpower.</i>

02:20.792 --> 02:22.693
Thor would never
wager his hammer.

02:22.694 --> 02:25.262
Neil Patrick Harris would never
wager his showmanship.

02:25.263 --> 02:26.430
Losing that car will be
the worst thing

02:26.431 --> 02:27.497
in the world for you.

02:27.498 --> 02:28.498
Well, what's
the worst thing

02:28.499 --> 02:30.100
in the world for you,
Santiago?

02:30.101 --> 02:31.969
Being one of those girls
in Jake's car.

02:31.970 --> 02:33.303
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

02:33.304 --> 02:34.771
Then it is settled.

02:34.772 --> 02:37.674
If Peralta loses,
Santiago gets his car.

02:37.675 --> 02:41.044
If Santiago loses, she goes
for a date in said car.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.079
Game on.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.480
Game on.

02:43.514 --> 02:45.382
Wow, your handshake
is quite firm.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.415
I took a seminar.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.451
Where?

02:47.485 --> 02:49.119
And the score
is all tied up.

02:49.153 --> 02:50.887
But not for long.

02:50.888 --> 02:53.090
For in eight hours,
I will win the bet

02:53.124 --> 02:54.758
and take Santiago
on the worst date

02:54.759 --> 02:56.193
in the history
of the world.

02:56.194 --> 02:58.395
<i>Attention.</i>

02:58.429 --> 02:59.429
After today's shift,
I'd like everyone

02:59.430 --> 03:00.831
join me at the bar
for drinks

03:00.832 --> 03:03.967
in honor of Detective Boyle
and his medal of valor.

03:04.002 --> 03:05.969
Oh, my God, is peanut butter
gonna be there?

03:05.970 --> 03:08.071
That horse is a damn hero.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.740
Peanut butter
will not be joining us.

03:09.741 --> 03:12.376
He's being feted
by the united nations.

03:12.410 --> 03:14.811
<i>As you were.</i>

03:14.846 --> 03:17.014
Pen.
You... ow!

03:17.015 --> 03:18.281
Rolly chair!

03:18.282 --> 03:20.083
Gina's desk!
Oh, Jake.

03:20.084 --> 03:22.085
No!

03:24.389 --> 03:25.455
Captain, hey.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.157
<i>You're looking
stoic today,</i>

03:27.191 --> 03:29.659
like a wise old oak.

03:29.694 --> 03:31.294
I'm not gonna give you
more cases

03:31.295 --> 03:33.463
so you can win your bet
with Santiago.

03:33.498 --> 03:35.132
What?
Oh, right, the bet.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.300
Totally forgot
about that.

03:37.335 --> 03:38.935
Well, granted,
this friendly competition

03:38.936 --> 03:41.204
has led to you and Santiago
putting in more hours

03:41.205 --> 03:44.107
and arresting more perps,
especially this last week.

03:44.142 --> 03:47.177
Up by one, Peralta.

03:47.211 --> 03:48.412
Anything you want to say
to your car

03:48.413 --> 03:50.947
before you never
see it again? Hmm?

03:50.948 --> 03:54.117
Hey, Santiago, do you have
any dietary restrictions

03:54.118 --> 03:55.752
that medieval times
should know about?

03:55.787 --> 03:57.187
Yes, 3-1-1?

03:57.188 --> 03:59.623
What's the safest way
to set a car on fire?

04:01.959 --> 04:04.194
Both of you have done
exemplary work,

04:04.195 --> 04:05.429
which I appreciate.

04:05.463 --> 04:07.664
And I can see that by
the absolutely no indicators

04:07.665 --> 04:08.664
on your face.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.267
However,
you are colleagues,

04:10.268 --> 04:12.169
and the fallout from this bet
has the potential

04:12.170 --> 04:14.438
to put a strain on your
professional relationship.

04:14.472 --> 04:15.939
Only if I lose.

04:15.940 --> 04:17.173
I'm a terrible sport.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.041
Cases will be assigned
as they usually are.

04:19.077 --> 04:22.079
<i>Dismissed.</i>

04:25.883 --> 04:28.418
Captain, you look...
No.

04:32.423 --> 04:34.124
Rosa, hey,
would you like to share

04:34.125 --> 04:35.325
a cup of coffee with me?

04:35.359 --> 04:37.461
<i>I got some gorgeous
new coffee beans.</i>

04:37.462 --> 04:38.829
Sure,
that sounds great.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.864
Isn't that, like, your fifth
cup of coffee today?

04:40.898 --> 04:42.199
I'm trying
to counteract

04:42.200 --> 04:44.234
the drowsiness
from my pain meds.

04:44.235 --> 04:45.368
I took
a double dose

04:45.369 --> 04:47.504
after the incident
at the ceremony.

04:47.505 --> 04:50.907
Bring peanut
butter forward... forward.

04:50.908 --> 04:53.543
Uh, can the little guy
take a big step back, please?

04:53.578 --> 04:54.945
My name
is Charles Boyle.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.214
I won the same medal
as this horse.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.951
The footage from my fall
led the local news,

05:00.952 --> 05:03.053
so who's the hero now,
peanut butter?

05:03.087 --> 05:04.921
Peanut butter.

05:04.922 --> 05:07.290
Gina, you're just
trying to hurt me

05:07.291 --> 05:09.860
to distract yourself
from your own internal pain.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.729
Also, you should use
less conditioner,

05:12.730 --> 05:15.732
because this
is a flat mess.

05:15.766 --> 05:18.034
<i>What's going on with Boyle?</i>

05:18.069 --> 05:19.569
His pain meds
are making him weird.

05:19.604 --> 05:22.806
Oh, okay.
Yes.

05:22.807 --> 05:23.907
This happened to my dad

05:23.908 --> 05:26.243
when he got
his vasectomy un-reversed.

05:26.244 --> 05:28.712
You get all relaxed
and you have no filter

05:28.713 --> 05:31.148
and you just start dropping
truth bombs on everyone.

05:31.182 --> 05:34.084
Oh, that explains
the elevator.

05:34.118 --> 05:36.553
I'm worried you don't
find me interesting.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.122
I'm gonna pretend
someone texted me.

05:43.127 --> 05:45.862
Gina, please keep an eye
on Boyle today.

05:45.863 --> 05:47.430
He's gonna say something
to the wrong person

05:47.431 --> 05:48.598
and get himself punched.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.200
Sure, I'd love to see
Charles get punched.

05:50.234 --> 05:51.401
Try again?

05:51.402 --> 05:53.937
I will stop Charles
from getting punched.

05:53.971 --> 05:54.971
Correct.

05:54.972 --> 05:57.607
Great.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.676
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

05:59.710 --> 06:02.879
I present Carl Laudson,
who stole $3,000.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.415
Santiago takes the lead
with one minute left.

06:05.416 --> 06:06.950
Suck it, Peralta.

06:06.984 --> 06:07.984
Oh, no.

06:07.985 --> 06:09.619
That's right,
"oh, no."

06:09.620 --> 06:11.021
Oh, no.
You don't seem worried.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.022
Why aren't you worried?

06:12.023 --> 06:13.957
Bring in the Johns.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.692
I ran a prostitution sting
through vice

06:15.693 --> 06:17.727
and arrested 30 guys
for soliciting.

06:17.762 --> 06:18.895
That's not a felony.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.263
It is when
it's your second offense,

06:20.264 --> 06:22.799
which is the case for ten
of these gentlemen.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.002
Four of them
are actually named John.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.137
Ironic.

06:27.171 --> 06:28.738
Anyhoo,
ten more for Peralta.

06:28.739 --> 06:29.739
Accept your fate.

06:29.740 --> 06:30.807
Never.

06:30.808 --> 06:35.845
Five, four, three, two, one.
No.

06:35.846 --> 06:38.949
Jake wins,
Amy loses.

06:45.323 --> 06:47.257
Look!

06:51.829 --> 06:54.431
Amy Santiago,
you have made me

06:54.432 --> 06:56.199
the happiest man
on earth.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.368
I spent $1
on this ring.

06:58.369 --> 07:00.537
Will you go on the worst date
ever with me?

07:00.538 --> 07:01.938
You have to say yes.

07:01.973 --> 07:03.139
Yes.

07:03.174 --> 07:05.175
She said yes!

07:05.176 --> 07:06.643
She said yes.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.679
This is for you.

07:14.780 --> 07:17.354
Amy Santiago,
date time.

07:17.382 --> 07:18.783
Time to date.

07:18.784 --> 07:21.285
Peralta, this outfit
is ridiculous.

07:21.319 --> 07:22.453
Chop chop.

07:22.454 --> 07:23.454
There's plenty
of embarrassing to do

07:23.455 --> 07:27.391
and only a few hours
to do it in.

07:27.392 --> 07:28.592
Happy?

07:28.627 --> 07:29.994
Oh, yeah.

07:29.995 --> 07:32.062
You look like every girl
at every bat mitzvah

07:32.063 --> 07:33.330
I ever had a crush on.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.499
Let's see the bow.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.401
Just like
Jenny Gildenhorn.

07:37.435 --> 07:38.803
Why do I wish
you had braces?

07:38.804 --> 07:40.271
Should we get you braces?

07:40.272 --> 07:41.271
No, that's too much.

07:41.273 --> 07:44.508
Here I come.

07:44.509 --> 07:45.509
Nice shorts.

07:45.510 --> 07:46.510
Thank you.
Believe it or not,

07:46.511 --> 07:47.778
they were not
very expensive.

07:47.813 --> 07:49.547
Do I really have to
wear this all night?

07:49.548 --> 07:50.581
You know the rules.

07:50.582 --> 07:52.016
The date starts now
and ends at midnight.

07:52.017 --> 07:53.050
I decide what you wear,

07:53.051 --> 07:54.418
what you eat,
and where we go.

07:54.452 --> 07:58.189
Oh, and there is
one more rule.

07:58.190 --> 08:00.558
No matter
what happens,

08:00.559 --> 08:02.626
you're not allowed
to fall in love with me.

08:02.661 --> 08:05.663
Won't be a problem.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.136
Detective Boyle, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.493
Your medal
was well-deserved.

08:13.505 --> 08:14.738
Thank you, sir.

08:14.739 --> 08:16.140
Your breath is terrible.

08:16.141 --> 08:18.209
Charles,
can I speak with you?

08:18.210 --> 08:20.077
Hey, where's Rosa?

08:20.111 --> 08:21.712
I haven't seen her
all night.

08:21.713 --> 08:23.280
Did you know my wife
pays me alimony?

08:23.281 --> 08:25.416
Okay, let's take a seat.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.218
I'm gonna keep an eye on
you all night, little buddy.

08:27.219 --> 08:28.419
Okay.
Thanks.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.420
Hey, baby.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.256
Hey, baby.
Happy you made it.

08:32.256 --> 08:34.792
Captain, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Sharon.

08:34.793 --> 08:35.893
It's so wonderful
to meet you.

08:35.894 --> 08:37.260
I've heard such great things
about you.

08:37.261 --> 08:38.261
And you.

08:38.263 --> 08:40.030
Your husband
is a real hero.

08:40.030 --> 08:41.398
If you ask me,
he should've been up there

08:41.399 --> 08:42.533
with Detective Boyle today.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.634
What for?

08:43.668 --> 08:45.483
For saving my life.

08:45.503 --> 08:48.105
He means metaphorically.

08:48.106 --> 08:49.940
You know, saving him
from all that paperwork.

08:49.941 --> 08:52.157
Paper cuts
are a slow death, baby.

08:52.177 --> 08:54.078
No, I was referring to how
he threw his body

08:54.079 --> 08:55.579
at an emotionally
disturbed criminal

08:55.580 --> 08:56.780
who was trying
to kill me.

08:56.781 --> 08:58.782
Nooo!

09:00.485 --> 09:03.487
He did what?

09:03.521 --> 09:06.713
Are you
back in the field?

09:06.725 --> 09:08.859
Oh.
I have caused a problem.

09:08.894 --> 09:12.863
I think I am...

09:12.864 --> 09:14.498
Getting a text message.

09:15.767 --> 09:19.270
Ah. There it is.

09:19.304 --> 09:20.852
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

09:20.872 --> 09:22.940
I thought I told you.

09:22.941 --> 09:24.708
Remember when you were
half asleep

09:24.709 --> 09:26.443
watching the news
and the babies were quiet,

09:26.444 --> 09:28.312
and I said, real low,
"hey, baby.

09:28.313 --> 09:29.647
I'm back in the field.
You want something to eat?"

09:29.648 --> 09:30.714
And you were like,
"what?"

09:30.715 --> 09:31.916
And I was like,
"you want something to eat?"

09:31.917 --> 09:33.183
And you said, "sure."

09:33.184 --> 09:35.825
And I got you
an oatmeal cookie?

09:35.854 --> 09:37.121
Remember?

09:37.122 --> 09:39.990
You are a piece of work,
Terrance.

09:40.025 --> 09:43.416
Oh, damn.
She called me Terrance.

09:43.428 --> 09:45.696
I'm doomed.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.534
<i>Hot date coming through.</i>

09:50.568 --> 09:53.003
Hey, attention,
everyone.

09:53.004 --> 09:56.907
Now I know that tonight
is Boyle's big night.

09:58.710 --> 10:02.413
But let's forget about that
completely for a moment

10:02.447 --> 10:05.688
and admire and comment on every
terrible aspect of this.

10:08.153 --> 10:09.776
Permission to go
to the bathroom?

10:09.788 --> 10:11.322
Granted.
First of three.

10:11.323 --> 10:13.490
Use them wisely.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.659
Hey.

10:15.660 --> 10:16.794
Congrats again, buddy.

10:16.795 --> 10:18.395
I really am proud of you.

10:18.396 --> 10:19.897
Still wearing the medal,
huh?

10:19.931 --> 10:21.732
Yes, I want women to be
impressed by me.

10:21.766 --> 10:23.968
All right.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.669
Well, I'm sorry
that I can't stay,

10:25.704 --> 10:28.105
but I have a terrible night
planned for Amy.

10:28.106 --> 10:30.307
First up is the mall
photo studio,

10:30.308 --> 10:32.209
where we'll take our official
date portrait.

10:32.243 --> 10:33.811
The picture will
be the two of us

10:33.845 --> 10:35.512
playing one saxophone.

10:35.513 --> 10:37.815
Then some peel-and-eat shrimp
for dinner

10:37.816 --> 10:40.284
at a dangerously cheap
seafood restaurant.

10:40.285 --> 10:42.419
And then I've contracted
a youth choir

10:42.420 --> 10:43.620
to serenade us.

10:43.655 --> 10:48.058
♪ Santiago Santiago

10:48.059 --> 10:49.226
<i>♪ Santiago</i>

10:49.260 --> 10:50.260
♪ Santiago ♪

10:50.261 --> 10:52.863
♪ You suck so bad

10:52.864 --> 10:53.964
Yes!

10:53.965 --> 10:55.599
They'll sing to her
at midnight

10:55.600 --> 10:57.034
the middle
of Times Square.

10:57.035 --> 10:59.269
She and
500 German tourists

10:59.270 --> 11:01.171
will savor that memory
for all times.

11:01.206 --> 11:02.706
Jake, do you know why
little boys

11:02.707 --> 11:04.641
pull little girls' pigtails
on playgrounds?

11:04.676 --> 11:05.776
'Cause they're so easy
to grab.

11:05.777 --> 11:07.177
They're just begging
to be pulled.

11:07.212 --> 11:08.445
Because they
like the girls,

11:08.446 --> 11:09.446
and that's the only way
they know

11:09.447 --> 11:10.414
how to get
their attention.

11:10.448 --> 11:12.016
What are you saying?

11:12.050 --> 11:14.351
All of this teasing,
this elaborate date,

11:14.352 --> 11:16.286
somewhere down deep,
you like Amy.

11:16.287 --> 11:17.521
Like, "like her,"
like her.

11:17.555 --> 11:19.523
Okay, that's
straight-up insanity.

11:19.557 --> 11:20.891
How much did you spend
on tonight?

11:20.925 --> 11:23.494
$1,400, but all of it's
on credit cards,

11:23.495 --> 11:25.662
so it's, like, $5 a month
for the next 2,000 years.

11:25.663 --> 11:26.764
I do not like Amy!

11:26.765 --> 11:28.599
You're putting a lot
of effort into a joke.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.700
Why don't you sit down

11:29.701 --> 11:30.701
and have a real
conversation with her?

11:30.735 --> 11:32.236
Okay, Boyle,

11:32.237 --> 11:34.938
you live in your ex-wife's
new boyfriend's basement.

11:34.939 --> 11:36.440
I'm not taking advice
from you.

11:37.642 --> 11:41.412
I'm ashamed
of my living situation.

11:41.446 --> 11:43.781
Rosa, why are you
sequestered

11:43.815 --> 11:45.516
over by this
old cell phone?

11:45.550 --> 11:47.451
I'm avoiding Boyle
and his truth bombs.

11:47.485 --> 11:51.955
I sometimes worry
I'm gonna become you.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.457
He keeps saying
he wants to talk to me.

11:53.458 --> 11:54.858
I'm afraid he's gonna
tell me he loves me

11:54.859 --> 11:56.827
or propose marriage
or something.

11:56.861 --> 11:57.961
Oh, my God.

11:57.962 --> 11:59.730
That makes me kind of
want to cry.

11:59.731 --> 12:02.266
He dove in front
of those bullets for me.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.500
I can't be mean to him.

12:03.501 --> 12:05.636
I watched him
make coffee

12:05.637 --> 12:07.438
for 28 minutes
this morning.

12:07.439 --> 12:08.872
But I also can't
lead him on.

12:08.907 --> 12:11.175
Captain Holt told me not to
let him get hurt tonight.

12:11.176 --> 12:14.178
So I'll keep him
away from you.

12:15.246 --> 12:17.214
Have you seen Rosa?

12:17.248 --> 12:19.049
Rosa died
eight years ago.

12:19.084 --> 12:22.152
Come on.
Let's get you a drink.

12:22.187 --> 12:23.720
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

12:23.755 --> 12:26.857
Santiago and I will be
performing the steerage jig

12:26.858 --> 12:28.325
from the film <i>Titanic,</i>

12:28.326 --> 12:29.893
<i>which we have prepared for</i>

12:29.928 --> 12:31.495
in no way, shape,
or form.

12:31.529 --> 12:32.529
Romantic.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.831
No, embarrassing.

12:33.865 --> 12:35.332
Milady.

12:41.539 --> 12:43.340
You look pretty.
I hate your guts.

12:43.341 --> 12:45.609
Channel that passion
into the dance.

12:45.643 --> 12:47.644
Peralta.
Scully, tag in.

12:47.645 --> 12:49.780
Okay.
Keep spinning.

12:49.781 --> 12:51.882
Yes. One of
our informants just called.

12:51.883 --> 12:52.883
We've been tracking
a crew

12:52.884 --> 12:54.205
that lifts cargo
out of Laguardia.

12:54.219 --> 12:55.853
The C.I. knows
where the trucks unload,

12:55.854 --> 12:57.455
so I need you to stake out
the drop site.

12:57.489 --> 12:59.923
Oh, sir,
I'm right in the middle

12:59.924 --> 13:01.925
of this date
and I cannot reschedule.

13:01.926 --> 13:04.628
I have far, far too many
non-refundable deposits.

13:04.629 --> 13:06.864
I'm renting a tiger cub
by the hour.

13:06.898 --> 13:08.432
For what?
Don't even know.

13:08.433 --> 13:09.533
Waiting for inspiration.

13:09.567 --> 13:12.035
Well, this is not
a negotiation, so go.

13:12.070 --> 13:15.072
All right, fine,
but I'm taking Santiago with me.

13:15.106 --> 13:17.508
As soon as we're done,
it's back to the date.

13:17.509 --> 13:19.076
Darling.

13:19.077 --> 13:20.344
Brief pause.
Duty calls.

13:20.345 --> 13:23.714
Oh, thank God.

13:23.715 --> 13:24.948
Gina, tag in?

13:24.983 --> 13:27.284
No, not even
if it would cure cancer.

13:27.318 --> 13:30.320
Okay.

13:33.492 --> 13:35.827
Look, baby, I'm sorry,

13:35.828 --> 13:38.396
but Captain's life
was in danger.

13:38.397 --> 13:40.565
I just did
what I had to do.

13:40.566 --> 13:42.667
It was
an impulse decision.

13:42.702 --> 13:45.837
Well, I guess
I can understand that.

13:45.838 --> 13:47.539
<i>Sharon.</i>

13:47.540 --> 13:48.640
I have to apologize.

13:48.674 --> 13:50.508
I want to assure you
that the call

13:50.509 --> 13:51.843
to put sergeant Jeffords
back in the field

13:51.844 --> 13:55.347
wasn't a spur-of-the-moment,
impulse decision.

13:55.348 --> 13:57.949
It's been in the works
for a few months now.

13:57.984 --> 14:01.620
Terry said
it just happened.

14:01.621 --> 14:06.992
I think you two need to get
your stories straight.

14:06.993 --> 14:10.462
Perhaps I should
stop talking to your wife.

14:10.496 --> 14:12.797
That's a good call.
Captain.

14:12.832 --> 14:14.733
Sharon.

14:16.335 --> 14:17.334
<i>I'm so happy</i>

14:17.336 --> 14:18.870
<i>to be out of that dress.</i>

14:18.871 --> 14:20.338
It was weirdly hot.

14:20.373 --> 14:21.539
Oh, yeah,
it's probably because

14:21.540 --> 14:23.541
it was a cotton
and plastic blend.

14:23.576 --> 14:24.876
But not to worry.

14:24.911 --> 14:26.244
We're gonna
catch these guys

14:26.279 --> 14:27.846
and get back to the worst
date of your life.

14:27.880 --> 14:28.914
No.

14:28.915 --> 14:30.048
Nothing will
ever be worse

14:30.049 --> 14:32.017
than the date I had
with my aunt's dentist.

14:32.018 --> 14:33.318
You should try
some of this.

14:33.352 --> 14:35.820
Okay.

14:35.821 --> 14:38.223
Oh. Okay. Hold on.
Hmm?

14:38.257 --> 14:40.959
Yeah, dessert
is out of the question.

14:42.194 --> 14:43.428
What was your
worst date ever?

14:43.462 --> 14:45.931
I think it's, like,
a 50-way tie.

14:45.932 --> 14:48.500
The last lady I went out with
burst into tears

14:48.501 --> 14:51.169
when I told her
I was a Gemini.

14:51.203 --> 14:52.404
Wow.

14:52.405 --> 14:54.572
Hey, those people
left that door open.

14:54.573 --> 14:56.441
I bet there's a better vantage
point from the roof.

14:56.475 --> 14:59.344
Mmm, and I bet it doesn't
smell like old cheese.

14:59.378 --> 15:01.046
Okay, that's hurtful.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.847
Shall we?
Yeah.

15:02.882 --> 15:04.582
So what else
don't I know?

15:04.617 --> 15:05.617
You cooking meth?

15:05.618 --> 15:06.618
You breaking bad?

15:06.619 --> 15:08.253
How many phones
do you have?

15:08.254 --> 15:10.188
I'm sorry,
I need to clarify

15:10.189 --> 15:11.323
something
I said earlier.

15:11.357 --> 15:13.058
Sergeant Jeffords
was correct

15:13.059 --> 15:14.659
when he said
that his choice to go back

15:14.660 --> 15:17.128
in the field that night
was an impulse decision.

15:17.129 --> 15:19.698
He didn't even take the time
to stop and gear up, so...

15:19.699 --> 15:20.699
<i>What?</i>
So...

15:20.700 --> 15:22.267
You didn't have
your vest on?

15:22.301 --> 15:24.636
Oh, no.
Oh, goodness.

15:24.670 --> 15:25.971
I shouldn't
have said that.

15:26.005 --> 15:27.472
I feel I may
have made things worse.

15:27.473 --> 15:29.574
Wait.
I can fix this, Ray.

15:29.608 --> 15:31.409
Now is not the time, Boyle.
Hush!

15:31.410 --> 15:32.911
I want to hear this.

15:32.945 --> 15:34.312
Boyle, let's not make big...
Hush.

15:34.313 --> 15:36.114
Truth time.

15:36.115 --> 15:37.449
We love your husband.

15:37.450 --> 15:38.449
He's a great cop.

15:38.451 --> 15:40.518
We will do anything
to protect him.

15:40.519 --> 15:42.988
And you have incredibly
attractive hands.

15:42.989 --> 15:44.956
And you, what the hell
are you doing,

15:44.957 --> 15:46.091
lying to your wife?

15:46.125 --> 15:47.459
Unless you want to
end up moving

15:47.460 --> 15:49.361
into my ex-wife's new
boyfriend's basement with me,

15:49.362 --> 15:50.829
you better man up.

15:50.863 --> 15:52.564
Don't you ever
keep anything

15:52.565 --> 15:53.999
from this
beautiful woman again.

15:54.033 --> 15:56.001
Seriously,
you are beautiful.

15:56.035 --> 15:57.635
Oh.
If he ever lies to you again,

15:57.670 --> 16:00.405
you can call me.

16:00.406 --> 16:02.240
I'm sorry, honey.

16:02.241 --> 16:03.575
I just didn't
want you to worry.

16:03.609 --> 16:06.277
Baby, I am always
gonna worry about you.

16:06.278 --> 16:07.479
But if you feel
like you're ready,

16:07.480 --> 16:08.980
then get your ass
back in the field.

16:08.981 --> 16:12.217
But if you ever keep
anything from me again,

16:12.218 --> 16:14.853
I will leave you
for this short, earnest man

16:14.854 --> 16:16.621
and his ex-wife's new
boyfriend's apartment.

16:16.655 --> 16:17.822
I know you're kidding,

16:17.823 --> 16:19.991
but Hercules is actually
a very good landlord.

16:19.992 --> 16:21.993
Sometimes, when they go
on nice vacations,

16:21.994 --> 16:23.561
I'm allowed
to use the hot tub.

16:26.332 --> 16:28.166
Man, I don't know
how Batman does it.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.701
It is super scary
up here.

16:29.735 --> 16:31.036
<i>Hey, will you grab
the binoculars?</i>

16:31.037 --> 16:32.337
They're in
my stakeout bag.

16:32.371 --> 16:35.373
Your stakeout bag
is 98% nuts.

16:35.408 --> 16:36.441
I get snacky.

16:36.475 --> 16:38.009
Besides,
nuts are super healthy.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.344
They're, like, 0% fat.

16:39.345 --> 16:41.513
Jake, that's not
true at all.

16:41.514 --> 16:43.615
It's actually
the opposite.

16:43.649 --> 16:46.651
What?
That nut vendor lied to me.

16:48.387 --> 16:50.422
I think a pigeon
just flew out of your car.

16:50.423 --> 16:51.523
Yeah.

16:51.524 --> 16:53.358
The windows
don't exactly roll up.

16:53.392 --> 16:54.826
The car's
a piece of crap.

16:54.827 --> 16:57.929
Why do you love it
so much?

16:57.930 --> 17:00.398
You really
want to know?

17:00.433 --> 17:03.068
I was two days out of
the academy, super nervous.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.469
Saw this guy
run out of a bodega,

17:04.470 --> 17:05.502
clutching
a bunch of cash.

17:05.503 --> 17:08.906
So I pursued him
on foot, 11 blocks.

17:08.907 --> 17:11.076
Finally catch him,
cuff him,

17:11.077 --> 17:14.479
throw him up against
that car.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.513
Turned out there was a for sale
sign in the window,

17:16.515 --> 17:18.849
and, it being the best day
of my life, I bought it.

17:18.884 --> 17:21.853
Thus began the debt.

17:21.854 --> 17:23.088
Crushing debt.

17:23.122 --> 17:25.190
Yeah, you do know me.

17:25.223 --> 17:26.891
Nut?

17:26.892 --> 17:28.059
Only if you throw it.

17:28.094 --> 17:29.661
Ready?
Ready?

17:29.662 --> 17:32.897
Mm-hmm.
Nice.

17:32.898 --> 17:36.634
You ready?
Uh-huh.

17:39.538 --> 17:41.272
What are you doing?

17:41.273 --> 17:42.640
Trying to catch it
in your nose?

17:42.641 --> 17:45.510
I got it,
I got it, I got it.

17:45.511 --> 17:47.245
It's Holt.
Keep practicing.

17:47.246 --> 17:48.580
Okay.

17:48.581 --> 17:49.581
Peralta.

17:49.582 --> 17:50.648
Oh, good news, Peralta.

17:50.649 --> 17:51.749
I found someone
from the night shift

17:51.750 --> 17:53.184
to relieve you
on your stakeout.

17:53.219 --> 17:55.820
Ooh.
Still make Times Square.

17:58.724 --> 18:01.192
You know, Captain,
hold off on the relief team.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.560
We're already here.

18:02.561 --> 18:04.028
Plus I'm curious
to see what happens.

18:04.029 --> 18:05.396
<i>Okay, it's your call.</i>

18:05.397 --> 18:06.664
All right.

18:08.801 --> 18:10.335
What did Holt want?

18:10.336 --> 18:11.569
Just checking in.

18:11.570 --> 18:12.651
How you doing?
Any progress?

18:12.671 --> 18:16.641
Yep.
Watch.

18:16.642 --> 18:18.643
The key is volume.
I see that.

18:20.655 --> 18:21.688
So be honest.

18:21.689 --> 18:22.723
If you'd won the bet,

18:22.724 --> 18:23.890
were you really
gonna destroy my car?

18:23.925 --> 18:27.194
No.
I was gonna drive it.

18:27.195 --> 18:28.562
So I could learn stick.

18:28.596 --> 18:30.664
You wouldn't.

18:30.698 --> 18:32.466
I would.
Would've been, like,

18:33.468 --> 18:36.003
No.
No!

18:36.004 --> 18:38.672
Hey, hey!

18:38.673 --> 18:39.673
<i>There's our guys.</i>

18:39.674 --> 18:41.274
What's the play here?

18:41.275 --> 18:42.476
Just follow my lead.

18:42.510 --> 18:45.212
Give me the ring.

18:45.246 --> 18:46.613
Now give me some nuts.

18:46.614 --> 18:49.182
I'm snacky.

18:49.217 --> 18:51.018
All right, fine,
darling.

18:51.019 --> 18:52.586
I'll ask him.
Will that make you happy?

18:52.587 --> 18:53.587
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

18:53.588 --> 18:54.755
We're kind of busye.

18:54.789 --> 18:56.990
Yeah, my girlfriend,
here, thinks we're lost.

18:56.991 --> 18:58.759
No, I know we're lost.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.427
I think he's an idiot.
Idiot?

19:00.461 --> 19:01.595
You know why
we're out here

19:01.629 --> 19:03.563
in the middle
of the night, Susan?

19:03.564 --> 19:04.998
I was gonna
propose to you.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.801
On the Brooklyn bridge,
where we met.

19:07.802 --> 19:08.869
Brooklyn bridge?

19:08.870 --> 19:10.103
We met on
the Manhattan bridge.

19:10.138 --> 19:12.272
You know what?
This is over.

19:12.273 --> 19:14.574
Say good-bye to the ring
and everything it represents.

19:15.977 --> 19:17.745
You son of a bitch!

19:17.746 --> 19:19.679
Hey, hey.
Stop yelling

19:19.714 --> 19:21.415
hey, no one talks to Susan
like that.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.083
And you know what else? On the ground!
NYPD! NYPD!

19:23.084 --> 19:24.618
You're under arrest.

19:24.652 --> 19:25.819
Nice work.

19:25.820 --> 19:27.220
You too.

19:27.255 --> 19:29.456
I'm sad y'all
are arresting me,

19:29.457 --> 19:33.464
but I gotta say,
I'm glad you're back together.

19:36.030 --> 19:38.732
Hey.
I need to talk to you.

19:38.733 --> 19:41.768
Oh.
It's happening?

19:41.769 --> 19:43.837
Remember when I took those
bus for you?

19:43.838 --> 19:45.238
Okay, let's do this.

19:45.239 --> 19:46.606
I think you're sweet...

19:46.641 --> 19:48.341
I didn't know
it was you.

19:48.376 --> 19:50.610
When I jumped in front
of those bullets,

19:50.645 --> 19:52.879
I didn't know
who I was protecting.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.981
I just saw a gun
and an NYPD vest,

19:54.982 --> 19:56.716
and so
I dove on instinct.

19:56.751 --> 19:58.185
You've been extra nice
to me

19:58.186 --> 19:59.786
because you thought
I'd risked my life for you.

19:59.787 --> 20:03.690
But I only did
what every good cop would do.

20:03.691 --> 20:06.259
When you finally
go out with me, and you will,

20:06.260 --> 20:07.561
it'll be because
I do things

20:07.562 --> 20:11.565
that only Charles Boyle
would do.

20:15.303 --> 20:18.271
Um, actually,
I have a coat in here.

20:18.272 --> 20:21.208
It's, uh... it's,
like... actually, I see it.

20:21.209 --> 20:23.050
It's, like... it's blue... it's,
like, right...

20:25.346 --> 20:27.280
Excellent job on the stakeout
last night.

20:27.315 --> 20:29.783
<i>I'm glad to see you two
still work well together</i>

20:29.784 --> 20:31.251
despite that
ridiculous bet.

20:31.285 --> 20:32.919
Thanks.
Me too.

20:32.954 --> 20:35.288
And I appreciate your turning
down the relief team.

20:35.289 --> 20:37.657
I'm not sure
they could've made that bust.

20:37.658 --> 20:39.392
Yeah.
Right.

20:39.393 --> 20:41.995
The relief team.

20:42.029 --> 20:46.500
So... sorry you lost so much
money last night.

20:46.501 --> 20:48.835
Guess you can add it
to your list of bad dates.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.738
Nah, it still goes on
the good date list.

20:51.739 --> 20:55.008
You know, 'cause we caught
the bad guys.

20:55.009 --> 20:56.243
That's very mature
of you.

20:56.277 --> 20:58.278
Well,
I am very mature man.

20:58.312 --> 21:00.614
<i>Package for Amy Santiago.</i>

21:00.615 --> 21:01.781
That's me.

21:01.782 --> 21:05.051
Special delivery from
Jake Peralta to say,

21:05.052 --> 21:06.386
"thanks for last night."

21:06.420 --> 21:08.054
Oh, no.
I forgot to cancel.

21:09.490 --> 21:11.424
Cancel what?
<i>Sir, you don't have to...</i>

21:11.425 --> 21:13.460
Okay.

21:13.461 --> 21:16.096
<i>Okay.
All right, so...</i>

21:18.032 --> 21:19.366
Okay, no, no,
no, no, no.

21:19.367 --> 21:20.433
All right, stepping in,
stepping in.

21:20.434 --> 21:22.869
I'll take this bullet
for you.

21:22.870 --> 21:24.604
Ugh. Hitchcock,
what are you doing?

21:24.639 --> 21:27.240
I thought... aren't
we all gonna... no?
