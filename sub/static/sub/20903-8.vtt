WEBVTT

00:00.047 --> 00:01.347
Previously on Stitchers...

00:01.382 --> 00:03.570
I have a history of watching
people I care about

00:03.596 --> 00:05.295
get into bad situations or worse.

00:05.320 --> 00:06.678
You don't talk about your mother much.

00:06.703 --> 00:07.889
What was she like growing up?

00:07.914 --> 00:09.390
Can I call you later?

00:09.415 --> 00:10.481
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:10.506 --> 00:11.639
As far as you and I go,

00:11.664 --> 00:13.570
we're just on totally different planets.

00:13.595 --> 00:15.289
Got a call from a friend
of mine at the DOJ.

00:15.314 --> 00:16.580
My name has come up in some meetings,

00:16.605 --> 00:18.338
and there might be an opening there.

00:18.363 --> 00:21.125
What I'm about to show
you stays between us.

00:21.150 --> 00:22.616
Well, clearly we have a problem.

00:22.641 --> 00:23.765
Or an opportunity.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.187
How long have you been in
contact with your father?

00:26.212 --> 00:27.344
Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten

00:27.369 --> 00:28.335
to keep seeing her mother like that?

00:28.360 --> 00:32.375
And where, exactly, does Kirsten
see Jacqueline Stinger cooped up?

00:32.482 --> 00:34.181
How could you betray me?

00:34.206 --> 00:36.015
Kirsten, I didn't mean to. I just...

00:36.040 --> 00:38.437
Can we please talk? Hey!
Listen to me! Just...

00:39.305 --> 00:41.238
I can't stand the thought of losing you

00:41.263 --> 00:42.429
and it being my fault.

00:42.463 --> 00:44.163
I guess that means you love me.

00:46.867 --> 00:48.428
Feel anything, honey?

00:48.453 --> 00:51.260
When you find Mommy, you bring her back.

00:57.138 --> 00:58.170
Hey.

00:59.207 --> 01:02.305
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Kirsten.

01:02.944 --> 01:05.718
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07.114 --> 01:09.114
You were doing it.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.917
Oh. Again?

01:11.953 --> 01:13.886
What kind of dream was it?

01:13.921 --> 01:16.322
Oh, I don't know. I don't
remember my dreams.

01:16.357 --> 01:20.137
- You don't?
- No.

01:20.162 --> 01:22.262
Not since I was a little girl.

01:26.107 --> 01:27.855
Well, thanks for the movie night.
It was fun.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.690
Now, don't try and change the subject.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.411
I still think something
got tweaked in your brain

01:31.436 --> 01:33.068
when you were stuck in
that stitch with your mom.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.341
That was so long ago. If that
was it, we would know by now.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.215
You know, I've been thinking, I...

01:40.240 --> 01:41.950
I know a top neurologist.

01:41.975 --> 01:43.566
She's not in the program.

01:43.591 --> 01:45.239
She'd keep the results between us.

01:45.264 --> 01:47.148
No running off to Maggie.

01:48.532 --> 01:50.247
Just us?

01:50.272 --> 01:52.404
I'm not risking us again.

01:52.992 --> 01:56.074
So, yeah, just us.

01:57.346 --> 01:59.370
Let me make an appointment.

02:04.054 --> 02:05.620
Okay.

02:09.904 --> 02:12.215
- Quincy.
- Hmm.

02:12.940 --> 02:14.807
Are you awake?

02:16.044 --> 02:18.071
I'm awake now.

02:20.295 --> 02:22.462
We're doing great, right?

02:22.497 --> 02:24.230
You and me?

02:26.846 --> 02:29.517
You okay? What's wrong?

02:29.542 --> 02:31.476
Oh, nothing.

02:31.511 --> 02:33.511
- You sick?
- No.

02:33.636 --> 02:35.759
- You pregnant?
- No.

02:35.784 --> 02:37.284
Your parents coming to town?

02:37.309 --> 02:39.376
No.

02:41.402 --> 02:44.022
I got the job offer from the DOJ.

02:44.047 --> 02:45.560
I'll be in the Office of Justice

02:45.585 --> 02:48.209
for Victims of Overseas Terrorism...

02:49.153 --> 02:51.186
in Washington.

02:51.536 --> 02:52.884
DC?

02:52.909 --> 02:55.592
I asked if I could stay in LA.

02:55.666 --> 02:58.219
I can't. And this job...

02:58.976 --> 03:01.055
It's everything you worked for.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.934
Yeah.

03:06.065 --> 03:08.856
Are we good enough to
make the move together?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074

03:18.908 --> 03:20.741
Hey, Ivy.

03:20.776 --> 03:22.079
You blew me off.

03:22.104 --> 03:23.533
I'm so sorry.

03:23.558 --> 03:25.151
I had dinner all ready to go,

03:25.176 --> 03:27.477
but something came up. I feel terrible.

03:27.502 --> 03:30.222
I want to make it right, so...

03:30.247 --> 03:32.409
Breakfast? I'm buying.

03:32.434 --> 03:33.653
I'm busy.

03:33.678 --> 03:35.734
Okay, yeah.

03:35.759 --> 03:37.782
I guess I deserve that.

03:38.955 --> 03:42.865
But... I am free tomorrow
night for dinner.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.923
I have yoga. Um...

03:44.959 --> 03:46.432
Come by around 8:00?

03:46.457 --> 03:48.557
Okay. Cool.

03:57.451 --> 03:59.218
It's 7:30 in the morning, Linus.

03:59.253 --> 04:00.799
If this isn't about a case, bye-bye.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.690
- Not about a case.
- Bye-bye.

04:03.596 --> 04:05.537
You have to get over Amanda.

04:05.562 --> 04:08.160
Why?

04:08.185 --> 04:10.385
You and I are going on
a morning beach run.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.995
- That's not gonna happen.
- Yes, it is.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.922
Even if I have to drag
you out in your jammies.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.593
- I see what you're doing.
- Mm-hmm.

04:20.663 --> 04:23.691
- I get it. You're a good friend.
- I'm a great friend.

04:23.716 --> 04:26.015
Come on. Beach run.

04:26.948 --> 04:29.892
Fine.

04:29.917 --> 04:32.439
Good! Now let me see your game face!

04:33.870 --> 04:36.568
Aw, come on! You can
do better than that.

04:38.417 --> 04:41.377
Yep! That's the one.

05:14.578 --> 05:19.304
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:23.242 --> 05:25.584
- Oof!
- No joke.

05:25.609 --> 05:27.148
Body was found in Soledad Canyon.

05:27.173 --> 05:28.549
Woman walking her dogs found him.

05:28.574 --> 05:29.687
She was way out there?

05:29.713 --> 05:31.109
She's got mean dogs.

05:31.134 --> 05:33.461
LAPD was canvassing for
witnesses, so far nothing.

05:33.486 --> 05:35.218
He didn't just fall from the sky.

05:35.243 --> 05:36.342
Or did he?

05:36.367 --> 05:38.400
Say hello to Fred Overmyer.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.225
US Air Force, Classified Unit.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.015
- What's with his face?
- Unclear.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.366
The ME said the initial tox
screen came up negative.

05:44.391 --> 05:47.459
- You spoke to Amanda?
- Salt. Wound. She e-mailed.

05:47.494 --> 05:49.261
She's running more in-depth screens now,

05:49.296 --> 05:51.693
so cause of death is still
unknown for the time being,

05:51.718 --> 05:53.360
but she's fairly
confident it was murder.

05:53.384 --> 05:54.450
How can she be so sure?

05:54.475 --> 05:56.507
Expressions usually relax at death.

05:56.532 --> 05:58.533
So no sign of a struggle, no witnesses,

05:58.558 --> 06:00.725
no tire tracks, no
footprints, no forensics.

06:00.750 --> 06:01.881
And no room for error.

06:01.906 --> 06:03.546
The Air Force classified
Fred's missions.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.594
They classified the base
he was flying out of.

06:05.619 --> 06:06.618
Whatever happened to him,

06:06.643 --> 06:07.953
it's not something they care to share.

06:07.978 --> 06:11.476
The Air Force might not
want to, but Fred will.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.878
- Hey.
- Yeah?

06:17.351 --> 06:19.604
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.925
We've been working together
for a while now, Quincy.

06:23.154 --> 06:24.720
Tell me.

06:24.745 --> 06:26.717
Stephanie's taking a job in DC.

06:26.742 --> 06:28.492
She wants me to transfer there.

06:28.517 --> 06:30.050
Oh.

06:30.710 --> 06:32.348
So what do you wanna do?

06:32.373 --> 06:34.492
I'm happy here.

06:34.517 --> 06:35.582
But...

06:36.244 --> 06:38.077
Look, I'm going today

06:38.120 --> 06:39.992
to San Francisco on NSA business.

06:40.017 --> 06:41.951
I can ask about a transfer to DC,

06:41.976 --> 06:43.350
so you know your options.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.580
- Thanks.
- Okay, hey, and listen.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.062
I haven't told the team
about Stinger and Ivy yet,

06:48.087 --> 06:49.773
so let's keep that under wraps for now.

06:49.798 --> 06:51.328
Got it.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.915
Lights to 20 percent, please!

06:55.940 --> 06:57.732
I need a go-no-go for stitch neurosync.

06:57.757 --> 06:58.723
- Life-Sci?
- Go.

06:58.748 --> 06:59.633
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.

06:59.658 --> 07:00.779
- Engineering?
- Go.

07:00.804 --> 07:01.782
- Communications?
- Go.

07:01.807 --> 07:02.898
- Medical?
- Go.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.169
- Comm check. One-two, one-two.
- I hear you.

07:05.194 --> 07:06.393
Mission clock set to
five minutes, please.

07:06.418 --> 07:08.151
Okay, Kirsten, I feel the need.

07:08.176 --> 07:11.457
- For what?
- The need for speed!

07:11.934 --> 07:14.017
For speed.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.975
Okay, induce stitch
neurosync on my mark.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.234
In three, two, one, mark!

07:26.504 --> 07:28.104
It's 1985.

07:28.129 --> 07:29.952
Fred's visiting a guy at his house.

07:29.977 --> 07:32.619
He seems out of it. Catatonic.

07:33.883 --> 07:35.750
There's a woman here.

07:35.785 --> 07:37.686
Yeah. He's stuck in the past.

07:37.711 --> 07:39.195
Aren't we all?

07:39.220 --> 07:40.662
It's not the same flying without Reed.

07:40.687 --> 07:42.187
Flying without you Reed.

07:42.251 --> 07:44.117
Frontal limbic network's all lit up.

07:44.142 --> 07:45.734
Fred's feeling guilty about something.

07:45.759 --> 07:48.445
Man, this shouldn't have happened.
Not to you.

07:48.470 --> 07:49.634
Fred's apologizing.

07:49.659 --> 07:51.305
Survivor's guilt, I think.

07:53.437 --> 07:55.237
Okay, found another memory hotspot.

07:55.262 --> 07:57.311
Standby, Goose. Moving you!

07:57.817 --> 07:59.718
Fred's in an Air Force control room.

07:59.743 --> 08:02.495
Tower, we have traffic for Genesis 2.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.812
Ten miles ahead, 40 degrees.

08:03.837 --> 08:06.394
Negative, Genesis 2, all clear.
Just you up there.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.795
They hear a pilot.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.484
He's asking about other
planes in the area.

08:09.509 --> 08:10.831
Wait, I see it.

08:10.856 --> 08:12.234
Can you say the type of aircraft?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.268
Negative. I've never
seen anything like it.

08:15.417 --> 08:18.624
It sounds like the pilot
thinks he sees a UFO.

08:18.958 --> 08:21.675
It's there! it's there! It's
coming right at our windshield!

08:21.700 --> 08:23.804
Turning left, 30 degrees!

08:24.055 --> 08:25.929
Fred's with Rudy.

08:26.234 --> 08:28.608
But he's not sick. It must
be before the accident.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.328
He's a pilot. His uniform says,

08:30.353 --> 08:33.320
"RG-F117."

08:33.345 --> 08:35.278
I'm telling you it was right there.

08:35.303 --> 08:37.370
- It came right at me.
- Could've been a satellite.

08:37.395 --> 08:40.520
No way. It was a UFO.

08:42.976 --> 08:46.381
The man from the house is
the pilot that saw the UFO.

08:46.406 --> 08:48.306
I got to report what I saw.

08:48.331 --> 08:51.098
Do that, you'll never see
the inside of a jet again.

08:51.145 --> 08:53.116
Or worse.

08:53.897 --> 08:57.119
He's gotta learn the real
truth about aliens and UFOs.

08:57.492 --> 08:59.623
Fred's with a female officer now.

08:59.648 --> 09:01.235
He wants to tell the
other pilot the truth

09:01.259 --> 09:02.741
about aliens and UFOs.

09:02.766 --> 09:04.304
Government conspiracy much?

09:04.329 --> 09:05.462
More like ridiculous much.

09:05.487 --> 09:07.492
- Skeptic much?
- Man of science much.

09:07.517 --> 09:08.772
There's no proof that...

09:08.797 --> 09:10.716
I'm being pulled to another memory.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.102
Still in the past.

09:14.676 --> 09:18.558
Fred's taking the pilot
into a restricted area.

09:30.909 --> 09:32.697
Oh, my God.

09:32.722 --> 09:35.103
- What?
- There's an alien on a table.

09:35.128 --> 09:36.634
Wait, a dead alien?

09:36.659 --> 09:39.159
An imaginary alien, I imagine.

09:39.184 --> 09:41.707
No, it's a real alien.

09:48.349 --> 09:50.207
It's... it's attacking them.

09:51.641 --> 09:53.425
The... the alien's alive.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.366
No wonder Fred's memories
are in the past.

09:55.391 --> 09:57.558
That was the critical event in his life.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.690
Okay, I think I got a
lockdown on the death memory.

09:59.715 --> 10:01.261
Good, because this is
all flavors of nuts.

10:01.286 --> 10:03.481
Stand by for warp, Star Kid.

10:03.506 --> 10:05.606
Fred's older. I'm at the
scene of his death.

10:05.631 --> 10:07.642
Welcome back to the 21st century.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.214
Death memory in ten seconds.

10:09.239 --> 10:10.439
Get what you can as fast as you can.

10:10.464 --> 10:11.956
He's waiting for someone.

10:11.981 --> 10:14.386
Wait. I see lights.

10:15.558 --> 10:17.565
- A car?
- No!

10:18.279 --> 10:20.312
They're coming from the sky.

10:20.337 --> 10:23.034
Three seconds.

10:23.261 --> 10:25.474
Time to phone home, Kirsten.
Make the bounce.

10:28.415 --> 10:30.048
Did you see who killed Fred?

10:30.073 --> 10:32.923
Yeah. Aliens.

10:34.261 --> 10:35.838
- Aliens?
- Yes.

10:35.893 --> 10:37.267
- Aliens.
- Yes.

10:37.292 --> 10:39.259
Aliens just killed...

10:39.294 --> 10:42.228
What part of "Yes, aliens
killed Fred," do you not get?

10:42.252 --> 10:44.971
The part about aliens
because they don't exist!

10:44.996 --> 10:47.388
So, while Maggie jets up to SF,

10:47.413 --> 10:48.862
here is what we are going to do.

10:48.887 --> 10:51.504
You guys are going to look
into Fred's whereabouts.

10:51.529 --> 10:53.104
Phone records, credit card statements

10:53.136 --> 10:54.948
leading up to the time of Fred's death.

10:54.973 --> 10:56.949
You are going to work up a filter

10:56.974 --> 10:58.920
to quiet the guilt from Fred's past.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.375
I will update Maggie.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.470
See if she can look into
whatever Fred was up to

11:02.495 --> 11:03.651
with the Air Force lately,

11:03.676 --> 11:05.268
and we can try to put an ID

11:05.293 --> 11:07.427
on that pilot and female
officer that Fred spoke with.

11:07.452 --> 11:09.081
Maybe they can shed some light.

11:09.106 --> 11:10.490
Why don't I research UFO sightings

11:10.515 --> 11:12.151
in the Soledad Canyon area last night?

11:12.175 --> 11:13.651
Ooh. Check out the MUFON site.

11:13.676 --> 11:15.907
They've got the most legitimate reports.

11:15.932 --> 11:18.929
Man of science. I am shocked!

11:18.954 --> 11:21.001
Do you honestly think
the Stitchers program

11:21.026 --> 11:23.226
is the only secret our government keeps?

11:23.261 --> 11:25.829
X-Files, Cameron. X-Files.

11:25.864 --> 11:27.163
Saw the whole series growing up.

11:27.188 --> 11:29.188
That wasn't real.

11:29.213 --> 11:31.320
Oh, but my first crush,
Gillian Anderson,

11:31.345 --> 11:32.980
was as real as it gets.

11:33.004 --> 11:34.904
Duchovny was a distant second.

11:34.929 --> 11:37.260
Okay, we got it. You're that person.

11:37.285 --> 11:38.760
Me, too. Mostly.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.288
There's no empirical proof of aliens.

11:41.313 --> 11:43.080
- Cameron's right.
- Thank you.

11:43.113 --> 11:44.198
There's only deductive proof.

11:44.223 --> 11:45.386
I hate you.

11:45.411 --> 11:47.932
There's a hundred billion
planets in our galaxy.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.836
There are 500 billion galaxies.

11:50.861 --> 11:52.573
Some of 'em must have life on them.

11:52.598 --> 11:54.883
Yes, but not life that has evolved

11:54.908 --> 11:56.774
so much faster than we did,

11:56.799 --> 11:58.580
and are now zooming across the galaxy

11:58.605 --> 12:00.487
killing old Air Force officers.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.328
When did I become the mature adult here?

12:02.353 --> 12:03.940
What about what Kirsten
saw in the stitch?

12:03.965 --> 12:04.838
Yeah, what about that?

12:04.863 --> 12:05.932
But there have been some things

12:05.957 --> 12:08.348
that you've seen recently in
stitches that weren't real.

12:08.373 --> 12:10.340
Fred's memories were real.

12:10.365 --> 12:11.893
I cross-checked the data.

12:11.918 --> 12:13.424
Okay, okay, okay.

12:13.449 --> 12:15.926
So, you believe.

12:15.951 --> 12:18.485
You... believe.

12:18.510 --> 12:20.361
You, I'm still stunned.

12:20.386 --> 12:22.385
President Eisenhower did have a pact

12:22.410 --> 12:24.666
to share secret technology with aliens.

12:24.690 --> 12:26.095
Et Tu, Fishy?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.498
I binged conspiracy
shows after I was shot.

12:28.523 --> 12:30.259
Look, maybe Fred was going public

12:30.284 --> 12:31.950
with proof that aliens exist,

12:31.985 --> 12:32.940
and he was killed because of that.

12:32.965 --> 12:34.250
Or he was sharing government secrets

12:34.275 --> 12:35.308
with the Greys and got caught.

12:35.332 --> 12:36.963
- Greys?
- Aliens. Keep up.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.368
Or his murder has nothing
to do with aliens,

12:39.393 --> 12:42.229
and everything to do with whatever
else Fred was working on,

12:42.254 --> 12:45.041
and my guess, it was some
secret military technology

12:45.066 --> 12:46.971
that went all sorts of wrong.

12:46.996 --> 12:49.018
Oh. Wait, you have
empirical proof of that?

12:49.043 --> 12:50.580
Hmm! Funny. No.

12:50.605 --> 12:52.866
But we're gonna find some, so...

12:52.891 --> 12:54.249
go.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.235
Awesome!

13:00.260 --> 13:03.128
The trees are identical on both sides.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.309
- It's been Photoshopped.
- Oh, good catch.

13:05.334 --> 13:08.190
Hey! Just got an ID on that
pilot that was with...

13:08.215 --> 13:09.761
Oh my gosh... Fred.

13:09.786 --> 13:12.019
He was discharged from
the Air Force in 1985

13:12.044 --> 13:14.846
after suffering a nervous breakdown.

13:14.871 --> 13:16.323
- His name's...
- Rudy Grant.

13:16.348 --> 13:18.345
- How...?
- He's a major UFOlogist,

13:18.370 --> 13:19.643
like world famous.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.801
Hey. That's Rudy Grant.

13:22.044 --> 13:24.711
He was all over those shows
that I watched. He's...

13:24.736 --> 13:26.477
An alien crackpot, yeah. Just heard.

13:26.502 --> 13:27.635
And he is definitely the pilot

13:27.660 --> 13:28.859
that I saw with Fred in the stitch.

13:28.884 --> 13:30.848
Well, then maybe he knows
something about this.

13:30.873 --> 13:32.745
Checked into Fred's bank.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.939
Found a regular deposit
of thousand bucks cash

13:34.964 --> 13:37.551
into his account every month
for the past 20 years.

13:37.576 --> 13:39.995
Fred was getting paid under
the table for something.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.286
Could have been selling
Air Force secrets.

13:41.311 --> 13:42.944
If that's what it was, he had help.

13:42.969 --> 13:44.510
He was paying a guy named Pog Newcomb

13:44.535 --> 13:46.993
half his take every month
with money orders.

13:47.018 --> 13:48.817
Never met a Pog before.

13:48.842 --> 13:49.885
Well, you're about to.

13:49.909 --> 13:51.841
Go with Fisher and interview
this oddly named Pog,

13:51.866 --> 13:53.541
and we'll go have a
chat with Rudy Grant.

13:54.356 --> 13:56.659
Oh, I'm not surprised Fred was murdered.

13:56.684 --> 13:57.716
Why is that?

13:57.741 --> 13:59.575
Because of what happened to us.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.829
Which was?

14:00.854 --> 14:03.955
Which was me and Fred were
attacked by an alien.

14:03.991 --> 14:05.890
- At Dreamland.
- Dreamland?

14:05.926 --> 14:07.635
Roessell Air Force Base.

14:07.660 --> 14:10.424
California's answer to Area 51.

14:10.470 --> 14:14.048
So, can we discuss this alien attack?

14:14.073 --> 14:16.039
If that's what got Fred
killed all these years later,

14:16.075 --> 14:17.267
why not kill you too?

14:17.292 --> 14:19.519
Well, Rudy's too high-profile,

14:19.543 --> 14:20.854
too public.

14:20.879 --> 14:23.216
It would set off all
kinds of alarm bells.

14:23.241 --> 14:26.042
Rudy's got quite the following
in the UFO community.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.768
Oh, so I've heard.

14:27.793 --> 14:29.080
You're not a believer.

14:29.105 --> 14:31.172
No, sir, I am not.

14:31.197 --> 14:33.483
I get it, I get it.

14:34.056 --> 14:37.199
Any yahoo with a digital camera,

14:37.224 --> 14:38.808
tinfoil, maybe even a drone,

14:38.833 --> 14:40.705
and some scotch tape

14:40.730 --> 14:43.592
can pull off a convincing hoax.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.072
But there is, there is
life on other planets,

14:46.097 --> 14:49.268
and you give me a few nights out here,

14:49.293 --> 14:50.620
and I will prove it to you.

14:50.645 --> 14:52.679
Our house is on a ley line.

14:52.704 --> 14:54.475
- Right, honey?
- That's right.

14:54.816 --> 14:57.635
It's tectonic plates lined up,
sort of like a UFO highway.

14:57.660 --> 14:58.759
Hey!

14:58.784 --> 15:01.049
One believer out of two isn't bad.

15:01.146 --> 15:03.213
You know what, you should come, too.
We'll barbecue.

15:04.372 --> 15:06.306
Yes, yes, yes. Fred's murder.

15:06.341 --> 15:07.575
The question I have for you

15:07.600 --> 15:09.108
is when is the last
time you guys saw him?

15:09.144 --> 15:10.689
Ooh.

15:11.158 --> 15:12.924
Couple of months. Arlene?

15:12.949 --> 15:15.816
Oh, well, he did stop by
your book signing. Remember?

15:15.841 --> 15:17.541
That's right. That's when it was.

15:17.566 --> 15:19.919
Did you guys notice if
anything was bothering him?

15:20.929 --> 15:22.299
No, I didn't.

15:22.324 --> 15:24.604
Then, did he say what he was working on?

15:24.682 --> 15:26.696
No, but if he did, I couldn't
talk to you about it.

15:26.721 --> 15:27.690
You know that.

15:27.715 --> 15:31.509
Oh, come on. Can you at least
tell us where Dreamland is?

15:35.297 --> 15:37.812
For Fred, yes.

15:38.116 --> 15:40.231
But on one condition.

15:40.961 --> 15:43.761
Be careful when you go out there.

15:43.805 --> 15:46.605
Because if the aliens don't get you,

15:46.649 --> 15:49.075
the Air Force will.

15:58.068 --> 15:59.934
Hmm.

15:59.970 --> 16:02.224
Wonder what you would
look like in a uniform.

16:02.249 --> 16:03.747
Well, the uniform I could pull off,

16:03.772 --> 16:05.794
but I'd never let them touch my hair.

16:08.786 --> 16:10.803
Oh, it's the, um...

16:10.828 --> 16:13.230
neurologist. She wants to meet tonight.

16:13.255 --> 16:14.919
- Your place.
- My place?

16:14.944 --> 16:17.601
I told you I want to
keep this off the grid.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.939
Oh, yeah, okay. Text her back.
Tell her we'll be there.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.245
Where you going?

16:33.034 --> 16:35.735
Fred was out there in the stitch.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.975
The alien autopsy was down that hallway.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.001
Kirsten, our NSA badges got us this far,

16:40.026 --> 16:41.768
but the MPs with the very large guns

16:41.793 --> 16:43.660
told us that we need to stay here.

16:43.685 --> 16:45.549
Since when do we ever
do what we're told?

16:45.574 --> 16:47.188
Never, but... Kirsten.

16:47.213 --> 16:48.683
You better be getting coffee.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.678
You better... Kirsten!

16:51.073 --> 16:52.839
Kir... She's not getting coffee.

16:52.864 --> 16:54.795
Not getting coffee.

17:00.918 --> 17:02.530
This is it.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.961
You're gonna be disappointed.

17:37.193 --> 17:38.939
Disappointed.

17:54.442 --> 17:57.409
Not disappointed.

17:59.747 --> 18:02.039
Definitely not.

18:09.258 --> 18:10.796
Freeze!

18:10.821 --> 18:12.108
Don't take another step!

18:12.133 --> 18:13.425
Don't move!

18:40.558 --> 18:42.525
Agent Goodkin.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.183
Agent Clark.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.440
Colonel...

18:45.465 --> 18:47.094
Spencer.

18:47.119 --> 18:49.057
Two things saved you.

18:49.082 --> 18:51.340
One, you're with the NSA.

18:51.365 --> 18:54.433
Two, that flying saucer you saw?

18:54.458 --> 18:57.226
It's a declassified Air Force prototype

18:57.251 --> 18:59.411
we could never quite get off the ground.

18:59.436 --> 19:00.669
Heavily documented.

19:00.694 --> 19:02.019
Good thing for you,

19:02.044 --> 19:04.128
'cause if it was classified tech,

19:04.154 --> 19:06.007
you'd be in some very hot water.

19:06.032 --> 19:07.520
Is that what happened to Fred Overmyer?

19:07.544 --> 19:09.106
What do you know about his death?

19:09.980 --> 19:11.847
It's tragic.

19:11.882 --> 19:13.882
Fred was one of our best pilots.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.971
Other than that, I'm in the dark.

19:15.996 --> 19:17.619
- Wish I could help.
- What was he working on?

19:17.644 --> 19:19.284
That's classified.

19:19.309 --> 19:21.009
Classified as in

19:21.034 --> 19:23.446
the alien autopsy that
was performed here?

19:23.760 --> 19:26.562
Alien autopsy? Are you serious?

19:26.587 --> 19:27.987
We heard about it.

19:29.106 --> 19:30.171
From whom?

19:30.269 --> 19:32.002
An unstable nut bag

19:32.037 --> 19:34.071
who thinks that every weather
balloon over Dreamland

19:34.106 --> 19:35.822
is a close encounter of the third kind?

19:35.847 --> 19:37.793
Actually, I heard it from Fred.

19:40.152 --> 19:41.721
When were you in contact with him?

19:41.746 --> 19:43.412
That's classified.

19:43.447 --> 19:45.269
That's... actually true.

19:46.651 --> 19:49.433
If you think his murder is
connected with his work here,

19:49.458 --> 19:51.058
you're wrong.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.498
We have reason to believe

19:52.523 --> 19:54.550
he may have been selling
Dreamland secrets.

19:54.575 --> 19:57.030
Oh, Fred would never do that.

19:57.267 --> 19:58.653
He was a true patriot.

19:58.678 --> 20:00.444
There is something else.

20:00.469 --> 20:02.394
We need the name of a female officer

20:02.419 --> 20:05.259
that worked with Fred in 1985.

20:06.332 --> 20:09.354
Our personnel lists are classified.
Show them out.

20:09.379 --> 20:11.650
The next time you wander
off inside Dreamland

20:11.675 --> 20:13.433
without proper credentials,

20:13.458 --> 20:16.693
these NSA badges won't do you any good.

20:33.693 --> 20:35.526
- Sign.
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

20:35.551 --> 20:36.684
Texting and walking don't mix.

20:36.719 --> 20:38.035
Amanda?

20:38.060 --> 20:39.660
Ugh, you said her name.

20:39.685 --> 20:41.136
No. Cameron.

20:41.161 --> 20:42.674
They just finished up at Dreamland.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.556
They find any aliens?

20:43.592 --> 20:45.592
No, just a flying saucer.

20:45.628 --> 20:49.082
Seriously. The Air Force said
it was just a "prototype."

20:49.107 --> 20:51.510
Got to love alternative facts, right?

20:52.064 --> 20:53.899
Hey, you okay?

20:54.852 --> 20:58.551
You seem a little more wooden
and reserved than usual.

20:58.576 --> 21:00.598
- You and Steph good?
- We're fine.

21:00.623 --> 21:02.422
Yeah, okay, yeah, your lips say fine,

21:02.447 --> 21:05.846
but your face tells a
totally different story.

21:07.113 --> 21:09.013
Fisher, come on, it's me.

21:09.049 --> 21:10.260
The safe space?

21:10.285 --> 21:12.270
We tell each other stuff.

21:12.978 --> 21:15.273
Stephanie got a job offer in DC.

21:15.783 --> 21:17.261
She's gonna take it.

21:17.292 --> 21:19.611
Wow, um...

21:20.714 --> 21:23.096
Are you... are you gonna go with her?

21:23.131 --> 21:25.238
Maggie's looking into a transfer for me.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.541
I can't imagine not being
here with you guys.

21:28.566 --> 21:31.175
I hate to admit it,
but you're my family.

21:32.684 --> 21:34.710
Dysfunctional family.

21:35.186 --> 21:37.713
Best kind. Come on.

21:41.144 --> 21:44.946
You've been taking in 500
bucks a month for 20 years.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.005
A hundred and 20,000 in total.

21:47.043 --> 21:48.160
Not illegal.

21:48.185 --> 21:50.726
Well, not if you claim it on your taxes.

21:50.751 --> 21:52.684
Which you didn't. We checked.

21:52.719 --> 21:55.540
I'm trying to cooperate here,
and you had to go there?

21:55.565 --> 21:57.734
So, now I'm gonna need to see a warrant.

21:57.759 --> 21:59.665
Camille, how much do you
think this place makes?

21:59.690 --> 22:02.438
Hmm. Daily, weekly or yearly?

22:02.463 --> 22:03.663
Hmm. Not sure.

22:03.688 --> 22:05.071
Maybe we should check his books.

22:05.096 --> 22:06.560
See if he paid taxes on that.

22:06.585 --> 22:08.519
Like I haven't heard that threat before.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.048
All right, well, try this one on.

22:10.073 --> 22:11.781
Since I walked in here, I noticed

22:11.806 --> 22:15.548
one, two, three health code violations.

22:15.573 --> 22:17.148
Oh, just one second, Fisher.

22:17.173 --> 22:18.845
Ah.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.040
Four health code violations.

22:21.065 --> 22:23.184
I think this place should
shut down for a little bit.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.442
Get cleaned up.

22:24.467 --> 22:26.641
I am too old for this schnitz.

22:26.666 --> 22:28.800
The man who was giving you
money was found murdered.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.016
What was he paying you for?

22:31.041 --> 22:32.935
He wasn't paying me.

22:34.047 --> 22:35.947
I was just the middleman.

22:35.972 --> 22:37.640
The cash was going to my sister.

22:37.665 --> 22:40.276
- We're gonna need to talk to her.
- You can't.

22:41.389 --> 22:45.175
Peggy died a couple months
ago in an accident at work.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.409
Where'd she work?

22:50.329 --> 22:52.430
Aerospace somewhere.

22:52.455 --> 22:55.255
She didn't talk about it much.

22:56.847 --> 22:58.502
We done here?

22:59.515 --> 23:02.082
For now. We'll be in touch.

23:07.405 --> 23:09.271
- Aerospace?
- Accident?

23:09.296 --> 23:10.724
- I think not.
- No schnitz.

23:10.749 --> 23:12.715
- The female officer?
- I think maybe.

23:12.751 --> 23:14.264
Hey.

23:14.289 --> 23:17.357
- Linus, I'm with Fisher.
- Hey, got the advanced tox results.

23:17.382 --> 23:20.544
Looks like Fred died from a
lethal dose of nerve toxin.

23:20.569 --> 23:21.919
VX?

23:21.944 --> 23:23.610
Like Kim Jong-un's brother?

23:23.646 --> 23:25.663
That was his half-brother,
and it wasn't VX.

23:25.688 --> 23:26.927
- Toxin's unknown.
- Okay.

23:26.952 --> 23:28.514
How soon can the ME nail it down?

23:28.539 --> 23:30.764
- Don't say her name.
- Amanda tried.

23:30.789 --> 23:33.257
- You said her name.
- I'm sorry.

23:33.282 --> 23:34.634
The ME tried.

23:34.659 --> 23:36.218
The toxin is unknown.

23:36.243 --> 23:37.542
Let Cameron know what you found.

23:37.567 --> 23:39.505
I already did. He said we'll
pick it up in the morning.

23:39.530 --> 23:41.754
He and Kirsten had to be somewhere.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.155
You nervous about this?

23:44.180 --> 23:45.249
Hmm?

23:45.274 --> 23:49.177
No. Are you?

23:50.264 --> 23:51.575
Look, I...

23:51.600 --> 23:54.482
finally got over you telling Maggie

23:54.507 --> 23:56.451
where my mother was, and I'm...

23:56.476 --> 23:58.304
even wiling to give her a
little bit of slack, too,

23:58.329 --> 24:00.429
- but you cannot...
- Tell anyone. I won't, I won't.

24:00.454 --> 24:02.486
I won't. I promise, I promise.

24:15.905 --> 24:17.328
Hi.

24:17.353 --> 24:18.631
You must be Kirsten.

24:18.656 --> 24:21.085
Yes! It's nice to meet you. Come in.

24:23.479 --> 24:25.312
I'm sorry.

24:25.337 --> 24:27.437
Cameron didn't tell me your name.

24:27.462 --> 24:29.260
Of course he didn't.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.077
- Marian.
- Dr. Marian.

24:33.102 --> 24:36.278
Actually, it's Dr. Marian Goodkin.

24:37.973 --> 24:39.772
Hello, Cameron.

24:41.037 --> 24:42.624
Hi, Mom.

24:46.737 --> 24:48.470
How've you been, Cameron?

24:48.495 --> 24:50.614
Good. You?

24:50.988 --> 24:54.381
Oh, there it is. That superficial
grin you do so well.

24:54.406 --> 24:55.693
Gee, Mom, I've missed you.

24:55.718 --> 24:57.295
Sarcasm as refuge.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.763
My mother likes to analyze me.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.721
Oh, only when I see him, which I don't.

25:00.757 --> 25:02.491
Often. At all.

25:02.516 --> 25:04.417
She also likes to lay on the guilt.

25:04.442 --> 25:05.541
Real thick.

25:05.566 --> 25:08.045
She's almost as good at that
as she is at neurology.

25:08.070 --> 25:10.723
- Such a flatterer.
- I was trained by the best.

25:10.748 --> 25:13.171
Yes, you were. By his father.

25:13.196 --> 25:14.709
Who I hear you saw recently.

25:14.734 --> 25:16.634
Some sort of incident at the prison?

25:16.659 --> 25:18.382
Yes, but...

25:18.407 --> 25:20.734
- he's okay now.
- Excellent.

25:21.156 --> 25:23.881
Well... give a hug.

25:23.907 --> 25:24.819
And then get out of here,

25:24.844 --> 25:27.819
so Kirsten and I can get on with it.

25:35.282 --> 25:37.049
- Um...
- She'll be fine.

25:37.074 --> 25:38.240
Go.

25:38.530 --> 25:41.365
Are you sure? 'Cause, you know, I can...
I can wait.

25:41.390 --> 25:44.251
No, I'm fine. I'll...
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:45.699 --> 25:48.005
Come and sit down.

25:53.729 --> 25:55.931
Cameron tells me you two work together.

25:55.956 --> 25:57.306
Mmm, we do.

25:57.367 --> 25:59.433
So, how long have you been dating?

25:59.996 --> 26:01.694
He reached out to me for you.

26:01.719 --> 26:03.830
He's never done that for anybody.

26:06.419 --> 26:08.401
What do you like about him?

26:08.754 --> 26:10.454
Is this part of the exam?

26:10.479 --> 26:11.712
No.

26:11.788 --> 26:14.923
Just a mother asking,
if that's all right?

26:15.763 --> 26:17.830
Cameron's smart.

26:17.855 --> 26:20.611
He's loving and kind,

26:20.636 --> 26:23.368
and he always looks out for me.

26:23.393 --> 26:24.833
He loves you.

26:26.172 --> 26:27.471
He said that?

26:27.496 --> 26:29.423
No, but I can tell.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.673
Do you love him?

26:34.100 --> 26:35.900
You're right.

26:35.925 --> 26:38.180
That's not my business, is it?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.399
Look, I'd like to run some tests.

26:42.424 --> 26:44.189
See what's going on.

26:44.214 --> 26:46.561
So why don't we take a ride?
We'll go back to my office.

26:46.586 --> 26:49.049
Okay.

27:02.322 --> 27:04.649
Hey, you didn't call me last night.

27:04.674 --> 27:05.869
Was I supposed to?

27:05.894 --> 27:09.072
Ah, to yell at me for
springing my mother on you.

27:09.097 --> 27:10.452
Why? I liked her.

27:10.476 --> 27:12.572
Okay. Well, you don't have to say that.

27:12.597 --> 27:14.361
- I know my mother.
- Really? Do you?

27:14.386 --> 27:16.586
'Cause she's actually
incredibly insightful.

27:16.611 --> 27:19.279
Maybe bringing you to
her was a bad idea.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.805
I think you're being too hard on her.
She loves you.

27:21.830 --> 27:23.994
Okay, well, did she tell you anything?

27:24.019 --> 27:25.379
About you, not me.

27:25.404 --> 27:27.284
No. We ran some tests, did some scans.

27:27.309 --> 27:29.099
She's gonna get back to
me with the results.

27:29.124 --> 27:30.988
All right, well, don't get too attached.

27:31.013 --> 27:32.357
Why? I thought all little boys wanted

27:32.382 --> 27:33.894
to find girls just like their mummy?

27:33.919 --> 27:35.930
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with a response.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.282
Hey. I got DMV pics.

27:38.393 --> 27:42.329
Any of these Peggy Newcombs the
officer you saw with Fred?

27:42.354 --> 27:44.807
It's hard to say. The memory
was from 30 years ago.

27:44.832 --> 27:46.565
Hard to say, not hard to do.

27:46.590 --> 27:48.959
Give me a minute.

27:52.241 --> 27:53.914
On the right, that's her.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.299
Okay. Show me the money.

27:56.324 --> 27:58.534
And... Okay. Here it is.

27:58.559 --> 28:00.617
Until two days before
her "accidental" death,

28:00.642 --> 28:02.223
Officer Newcomb worked in the Air Force

28:02.249 --> 28:04.379
chemical research lab at Dreamland.

28:04.404 --> 28:06.169
She must be who Fred was
with in the stitch.

28:06.194 --> 28:06.772
Uh-huh.

28:06.797 --> 28:08.613
All right. I'll see what I
can find out about her.

28:08.638 --> 28:09.857
Great.

28:10.028 --> 28:11.376
I understand.

28:11.401 --> 28:12.867
The NSA won't budge,

28:12.892 --> 28:14.388
and there's still a hiring freeze.

28:14.413 --> 28:17.231
But it doesn't mean a spot won't
open up for you down the road.

28:17.256 --> 28:18.644
If it's DC you want,

28:18.669 --> 28:20.802
I can put in a good
word with the local PD.

28:20.827 --> 28:22.107
Thanks for trying, Maggie.

28:22.132 --> 28:23.521
Not easy, I know.

28:23.546 --> 28:25.387
Call me if you need a shoulder.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.623
I'm gonna need one either way.

28:28.782 --> 28:30.291
That Maggie?

28:32.499 --> 28:34.295
Are you going to DC?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.670
Hey, Fisher.

28:36.695 --> 28:39.759
- You got a sec?
- Yeah.

28:46.314 --> 28:48.436
What's up, boss?

28:52.731 --> 28:55.862
Maggie's notes seem to
indicate you knew about this.

28:56.431 --> 28:58.064
I accidentally saw it.

28:58.089 --> 28:59.822
So, you accidentally read it too?

29:00.175 --> 29:01.749
Maggie asked me not to say anything.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.441
- To me and Kirsten?
- To anyone.

29:03.466 --> 29:05.299
If Stinger's in contact with Ivy,

29:05.324 --> 29:06.145
I've gotta tell Kirsten.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.705
Not until Maggie gives you the go-ahead.

29:08.951 --> 29:10.925
- Okay.
- You're gonna tell Kirsten anyway.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.231
- Yep.
- Don't.

29:12.257 --> 29:13.621
- I have to.
- You can't.

29:13.646 --> 29:15.712
Fisher, the last time I kept
something from Kirsten,

29:15.748 --> 29:18.049
it almost ruined everything between us.

29:18.302 --> 29:20.717
I'm not making that mistake again.

29:22.712 --> 29:24.679
And you just found this?

29:25.335 --> 29:26.974
Few minutes ago.

29:27.494 --> 29:29.977
I haven't even told Maggie I know.

29:32.824 --> 29:35.177
Kirsten, say something.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.716
What are you gonna do?

29:38.741 --> 29:40.984
Talk to Ivy. Make her
tell me what's going on.

29:41.009 --> 29:42.975
No. No way. Not until we talk to Maggie.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.333
- Talk to Maggie about what?
- Nothing.

29:44.358 --> 29:46.424
Doesn't sound like nothing. Spill.

29:46.449 --> 29:48.661
- Don't.
- Please don't.

29:49.841 --> 29:52.832
Ivy's been in contact with Stinger.

30:03.175 --> 30:05.399
So no one's gonna say it?

30:05.963 --> 30:09.181
I let Ivy back into my life.
I'm an idiot.

30:09.206 --> 30:10.905
There's gotta be an explanation.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.391
There is. Four words.

30:12.416 --> 30:14.082
I told you so.

30:14.107 --> 30:15.727
Don't rush to judgment.

30:15.752 --> 30:17.275
Any of you.

30:17.301 --> 30:18.621
You're missing the point.

30:18.646 --> 30:21.026
This photo proves that Ivy can
get in touch with Stinger,

30:21.051 --> 30:22.150
something she said she couldn't do.

30:22.175 --> 30:24.250
She said that she didn't
know where he was,

30:24.275 --> 30:26.175
not that she couldn't
get in touch with him.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.641
Maybe he reached out to her first.

30:27.666 --> 30:29.291
Either way, she's a risk.

30:29.316 --> 30:31.033
- I'll talk to her.
- No, you won't.

30:31.059 --> 30:33.330
Fisher's right. You can't
talk to her about this.

30:33.355 --> 30:35.752
- I'll do it.
- Okay, hold it.

30:35.777 --> 30:38.581
I agree with Camille, but we are
still very much on a case here.

30:38.606 --> 30:41.274
That refractory period's up and
Fred's gonna hit his "best by" date.

30:41.299 --> 30:44.134
So, Kirsten.

30:51.533 --> 30:52.881
Yep.

30:52.906 --> 30:55.311
I'm back in 1985.

30:55.336 --> 30:56.862
Fred's with Peggy at Dreamland.

30:57.042 --> 30:59.595
Soft landing. Turning and burning.

31:02.395 --> 31:05.739
Fred's in a bookstore. Present day.

31:06.211 --> 31:08.298
Rudy's signing books.

31:09.331 --> 31:10.964
Arlene's here.

31:12.909 --> 31:14.259
Freddy boy.

31:14.284 --> 31:16.970
Yeah. Could you get me four
fresh ones for his grandkids?

31:16.995 --> 31:19.062
Four fresh ones for his grandkids.

31:19.097 --> 31:21.255
Rudy, you need to know the truth.

31:22.039 --> 31:24.244
Fred's telling Rudy he
needs to know the truth.

31:24.269 --> 31:25.253
The truth about what?

31:25.277 --> 31:27.947
That alien attack at
the base was a prank.

31:27.972 --> 31:31.565
A prank. That alien attack at the base.
A prank.

31:33.311 --> 31:35.861
Man, Rudy's gonna laugh his ass off.

31:35.886 --> 31:38.987
Well, make it quick. It's
hot as hell in this thing.

31:39.012 --> 31:42.080
The alien attack was
staged by Fred and Peggy.

31:42.105 --> 31:45.194
She pretended to be the alien.

31:47.667 --> 31:49.956
Me and Peggy didn't think
you'd freak the way you did.

31:49.981 --> 31:51.990
You know, the breakdown.

31:52.420 --> 31:55.859
Shall I make it out to
Sam or Little Sammy?

31:56.366 --> 31:57.596
You hear me?

31:57.621 --> 32:00.522
I'm gonna make it out to Sam.

32:00.854 --> 32:03.867
The money you've been
giving me I've been sharing

32:03.892 --> 32:05.285
with Peggy.

32:05.310 --> 32:07.939
The guilt's been eating at me, Rudy.

32:07.964 --> 32:10.512
Rudy's been giving Fred that money.

32:11.937 --> 32:13.994
I can't take your money anymore.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.285
Of course you can.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.971
It's your story, too.

32:16.996 --> 32:18.682
No, it was a lie.

32:18.707 --> 32:20.814
- It was a lie!
- It wasn't.

32:20.839 --> 32:23.792
Rudy's getting upset. He still
thinks that the alien was real.

32:23.817 --> 32:24.983
This!

32:25.008 --> 32:26.291
This.

32:26.316 --> 32:30.119
The aliens, UFOS... it's all lies.

32:30.144 --> 32:32.534
- Enough!
- It's a fraud!

32:32.559 --> 32:34.620
He's a fraud.

32:37.564 --> 32:40.666
Enough! Enough, that's enough!

32:40.753 --> 32:44.214
Just get out of here. Just go.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.829
I'm where he died.

32:46.854 --> 32:49.343
I see the lights.

32:52.246 --> 32:55.649
Death moment in three seconds.

32:57.365 --> 32:59.131
Time's up. Make the bounce.

33:06.251 --> 33:08.918
The chemicals were sprayed
on Fred by a drone.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.080
- So no UFO?
- Not this time.

33:11.105 --> 33:15.065
Aw, gee. You mean, sometimes junk
science is actually just junk?

33:15.400 --> 33:17.641
Fake UFO. Yeah, that's too bad.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.416
Doesn't disprove a government
conspiracy though.

33:20.905 --> 33:24.033
Rudy said that it would
be easy to fake a UFO

33:24.058 --> 33:25.166
with some tinfoil and...

33:25.191 --> 33:26.922
A drone.

33:29.621 --> 33:31.354
You think I killed Fred.

33:31.379 --> 33:33.546
If he went public about
the fake alien attack,

33:33.571 --> 33:35.304
he would've ruined your reputation.

33:35.329 --> 33:36.854
The attack wasn't fake.

33:36.879 --> 33:38.205
I was there. You weren't.

33:38.230 --> 33:39.979
Okay, Rudy, honey. Just calm down.

33:40.004 --> 33:41.741
All right, please. You're upsetting him.

33:41.766 --> 33:43.627
You got the chemicals from
Peggy Newcomb, didn't you?

33:43.652 --> 33:46.205
- What chemicals?
- All right, just stop it! Please.

33:46.230 --> 33:47.315
The nerve toxin that killed Fred.

33:47.340 --> 33:48.752
Five bucks says you got it from her.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.338
- No.
- All right, that's enough.

33:50.363 --> 33:51.293
You need to leave.

33:51.318 --> 33:53.334
We know that you've been paying
Fred off all these years.

33:53.359 --> 33:55.995
That's right. For our story!

33:56.020 --> 33:57.260
- But...
- But that changed,

33:57.285 --> 33:59.625
when you found out, he
faked the whole thing.

33:59.650 --> 34:01.483
That Peggy Newcomb
pretended to be the alien,

34:01.518 --> 34:03.315
and he was splitting his
half of the share with her.

34:03.340 --> 34:05.182
That's not true! That's not...

34:05.207 --> 34:06.658
We are not alone!

34:06.683 --> 34:08.377
We're not! Look out there.

34:08.402 --> 34:11.437
You got the ley lines,
right outside. Look!

34:11.462 --> 34:12.963
You'll see! I mean...

34:12.995 --> 34:14.844
All right. You believe.

34:15.501 --> 34:17.902
- Look out there.
- Rudy. Rudy.

34:17.934 --> 34:20.158
You said yourself that
anyone with some tinfoil,

34:20.183 --> 34:22.284
and a drone can pull off a decent hoax.

34:22.309 --> 34:23.650
- Yes.
- Fred was killed with a drone,

34:23.676 --> 34:25.393
and we know you have a
license to operate one.

34:25.418 --> 34:27.217
I never even flew the...

34:40.578 --> 34:42.545
You... you didn't.

34:42.570 --> 34:44.503
Arlene, wh...

34:49.551 --> 34:53.739
Fred wanted to take away
everything that you believed in.

34:54.822 --> 34:56.688
And I just couldn't let him do that.

34:56.714 --> 34:57.780
So you killed him.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.497
You found out where Peggy worked,

34:59.522 --> 35:00.835
and you threatened to cut her off

35:00.860 --> 35:02.240
if she didn't give you the nerve toxin.

35:02.265 --> 35:04.670
And when she refused, you killed her.

35:06.126 --> 35:09.160
Rudy is the love of my life.

35:09.185 --> 35:10.918
And I couldn't just stand by

35:10.943 --> 35:14.069
and watch him just swirl
into madness again.

35:14.444 --> 35:16.819
I had to kill him.

35:16.844 --> 35:18.680
I lost you once, sweetheart,

35:18.705 --> 35:21.540
and I could not let Fred
take you away from me again.

35:21.565 --> 35:22.936
No, no.

35:22.961 --> 35:26.479
He could never take what's real away.
Never.

35:26.504 --> 35:28.522
And what's real? That's us.

35:28.547 --> 35:31.780
Arlene, that's all that matters.
It's just us.

35:32.508 --> 35:35.381
Arlene Grant, I need
you to come with us.

35:35.406 --> 35:37.439
- Come on.
- No.

35:52.629 --> 35:55.190
Hey! I just spoke to your mom.

35:55.215 --> 35:57.823
- My test results came in.
- Is everything okay?

35:57.848 --> 35:58.848
Well, she didn't say,

35:58.873 --> 36:01.121
but she wants us to meet her
at your place at 7:00 p.m.

36:01.146 --> 36:02.728
Okay. We can do dinner after?

36:02.753 --> 36:05.386
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but I have some
stuff to do around here first,

36:05.411 --> 36:06.543
so I'll meet you there?

36:06.568 --> 36:08.331
- Sure.
- Great.

36:14.169 --> 36:17.003
So you still believe
in little green men?

36:17.335 --> 36:19.548
I believe that soldiers
wear green uniforms,

36:19.573 --> 36:21.814
and some of them work on
secret government projects.

36:21.839 --> 36:24.442
So... yeah.

36:26.922 --> 36:28.511
Hold the door.

36:28.536 --> 36:30.506
Thanks. You covered for tonight?

36:30.531 --> 36:31.696
I'm going to Krav Maga.

36:31.728 --> 36:34.262
Between my breakup and Ivy bombshell,

36:34.287 --> 36:36.519
I just might put my sparring
partner in the hospital.

36:36.544 --> 36:40.136
So, yeah. I'm covered. What about you?
You good?

36:40.244 --> 36:42.978
I'm gonna go home. I'm
gonna open a beer.

36:43.003 --> 36:45.557
I'm gonna try and figure
this whole DC thing out.

36:45.582 --> 36:47.927
Which way you leaning?

36:53.793 --> 36:55.500
Everyone gone?

36:55.525 --> 36:57.192
Let's do this.

37:04.114 --> 37:05.781
Hey.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.949
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

37:07.974 --> 37:09.933
Sorting out our clothes.

37:09.958 --> 37:11.507
You know, we don't
have much winter wear.

37:11.532 --> 37:13.231
We're gonna need to get some.

37:13.937 --> 37:15.970
I, uh...

37:16.339 --> 37:17.859
Got us some dinner.

37:17.895 --> 37:20.574
Some pad see ew and chicken satay.

37:20.599 --> 37:22.214
Thank you, babe.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.107
Steph...

37:26.216 --> 37:28.174
I couldn't get a transfer.

37:30.930 --> 37:32.696
That's okay.

37:32.904 --> 37:34.683
You'll get something else.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.722
I'm sure once I get settled in,

37:36.747 --> 37:38.418
I'll be able to work the network.

37:38.443 --> 37:40.621
I don't know. I mean, I...

37:42.576 --> 37:46.074
I just think maybe we need some
more time to figure this out.

37:48.930 --> 37:51.585
You mean you need more time.

37:55.634 --> 37:57.831
You're choosing work over us again.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.525
Aren't you?

38:07.204 --> 38:08.810
Hey, Cam.

38:08.846 --> 38:10.337
Come in.

38:10.362 --> 38:11.984
Kirsten should be here soon.

38:12.009 --> 38:14.361
Actually, she's not coming.

38:14.386 --> 38:17.500
- What?
- I told her I was still waiting on some results.

38:19.350 --> 38:20.994
She thought it would be a good idea

38:21.019 --> 38:23.088
for you and I to see each other again...

38:23.243 --> 38:24.680
by ourselves.

38:24.705 --> 38:26.004
To what end?

38:26.029 --> 38:28.901
She said that she couldn't stand by
and watch the man that she loves

38:28.926 --> 38:31.259
turn his back on his
relationship with his mother.

38:31.284 --> 38:33.866
She said that it was something
that she didn't have.

38:33.891 --> 38:35.533
Along with my trust at the moment.

38:35.558 --> 38:38.384
Look, I don't think it's such a
bad idea that you and I talk.

38:38.409 --> 38:39.642
What happens next?

38:39.820 --> 38:41.611
You and I chitchat for a
bit, and then suddenly,

38:41.636 --> 38:43.329
everything between us is better?

38:43.355 --> 38:45.407
You're right. It's a bad idea.

38:45.594 --> 38:48.033
So, dinner?

38:48.058 --> 38:50.158
Actually, I'm supposed to
get dinner with Kirsten.

38:50.183 --> 38:52.345
She's canceling on you.

38:54.884 --> 38:58.283
- So?
- Dinner.

38:59.659 --> 39:02.356
You know, I do find it
a little weird though,

39:02.381 --> 39:03.803
that her test results aren't back yet.

39:03.828 --> 39:06.795
Oh, there was just something
odd on the EEG and the scan.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.353
I sent it back for another look.

39:08.378 --> 39:10.145
Uh, should I be worried?

39:10.170 --> 39:12.964
No. It just looked like
some sort of reflection.

39:12.989 --> 39:14.252
It's not a tumor.

39:14.277 --> 39:15.807
I'm sure it's nothing.

39:15.831 --> 39:18.720
Come on. My treat.

39:24.545 --> 39:28.782
I... thought we were
just gonna talk to Ivy.

39:28.807 --> 39:31.033
You know, not break into her apartment.

39:31.058 --> 39:34.072
We're not breaking in.
We used her spare key.

39:44.755 --> 39:46.449
Okay. There's her laptop.

39:46.474 --> 39:48.083
You look around. Tell me
if you find anything.

39:48.108 --> 39:49.325
Okay.

39:57.835 --> 39:59.897
To-do list.

40:00.889 --> 40:04.593
Spelling tests, lesson plans.

40:05.114 --> 40:07.848
There's nothing here about Stinger.

40:07.922 --> 40:09.529
Okay, I'm duplicating the hard drive,

40:09.554 --> 40:12.521
so we can find every reference to
Stinger she has on her system.

40:12.546 --> 40:14.398
Although, I gotta be honest.

40:14.433 --> 40:16.116
I don't think we're gonna find anything.

40:16.141 --> 40:17.958
Well, we'll see.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.679
Be quick though, okay? Her yoga
class ends in ten minutes.

40:20.704 --> 40:21.670
Yeah.

40:26.971 --> 40:28.717
Whoa.

40:29.284 --> 40:31.096
What?

40:32.525 --> 40:34.459
She...

40:34.484 --> 40:38.432
She saved every little thing
from her life with Stinger.

40:40.700 --> 40:44.151
She... she said she hated
him, but clearly, she didn't.

40:44.176 --> 40:45.479
Oh my God!

40:45.504 --> 40:47.537
I know. I mean...

40:47.618 --> 40:49.485
God, if she still cares about him, then,

40:49.510 --> 40:51.512
what would she be willing
to do to get him back?

40:51.537 --> 40:53.275
No. No, no, no. Come here.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.088
Look. You gotta look at this.

40:55.113 --> 40:56.807
Come here.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.846
Look at this.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.260
Oh my God.

41:06.516 --> 41:09.729
Ivy ran the anomaly on us.

41:11.849 --> 41:15.014
She's the one who trapped
me in my memory.

41:16.205 --> 41:19.018
She's the one who almost killed me.
