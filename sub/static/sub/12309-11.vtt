WEBVTT

00:06.576 --> 00:07.709
That could lead us to his secret lab.

00:10.088 --> 00:12.088
We were attacked.

00:12.088 --> 00:13.422
By who?

00:13.422 --> 00:14.921
I was hoping you could tell me.

00:14.921 --> 00:17.355
Get the device
operational within one hour

00:17.355 --> 00:18.721
Or I will kill him.

00:18.721 --> 00:19.721
Do you understand?

00:22.055 --> 00:25.221
Somehow, you've found the attero device.

00:25.221 --> 00:26.522
What?

00:29.388 --> 00:30.854
We're locked in.

00:30.854 --> 00:33.921
Wait, there's a very dangerous,
serious problem with the device,

00:33.921 --> 00:35.388
And we need to
talk to your boss--

00:35.388 --> 00:37.288
If the power continues
to build like this,

00:37.288 --> 00:38.587
The gate will reach critical overload

00:38.587 --> 00:40.021
And most certainly explode.

00:40.021 --> 00:41.288
Everyone that doesn't need to be here,

00:41.288 --> 00:42.821
Get to the edge of the city.

00:42.821 --> 00:45.321
It's not enough.

00:47.521 --> 00:48.555
Move quickly.

00:48.555 --> 00:49.621
We have to get everyone

00:49.621 --> 00:50.621
To the lower levels of the tower

00:50.621 --> 00:51.788
To make sure that
everyone will be--

00:59.021 --> 01:00.221
Colonel sheppard, are you all right?

01:01.921 --> 01:02.821
John?

01:03.221 --> 01:04.120
Teyla!

01:04.120 --> 01:05.254
How many were up there?

01:05.254 --> 01:05.888
Two.

01:05.888 --> 01:07.488
I'll go get my people.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.121 --> 01:19.121
John?!

01:21.888 --> 01:23.621
They were right here when I left them.

01:23.621 --> 01:25.621
If the explosion was hot enough,

01:25.621 --> 01:29.655
There might not be anything
left for us to find.

01:34.221 --> 01:35.922
Did you hear that?

01:43.455 --> 01:44.621
John!

01:48.188 --> 01:51.054
We didn't take cover.

01:51.054 --> 01:52.822
Are you all right?

01:53.055 --> 01:55.021
Are you all right?

01:55.021 --> 01:56.422
My ears...

01:56.422 --> 01:58.421
I think I've got a
some glass in my back.

01:58.521 --> 01:59.221
Marie...

02:01.621 --> 02:03.821
We lost the stargate,
we lost the control room.

02:03.821 --> 02:04.421
That's bad.

02:04.421 --> 02:06.621
But we did not lose you.

02:06.621 --> 02:08.488
That's good.

02:08.488 --> 02:09.687
Okay.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.354
All the troops you've
requested have beamed onboard.

02:20.354 --> 02:22.087
Have them round up
the rest of the humans

02:22.087 --> 02:25.655
And confine them to
one of the hangar bays.

02:25.655 --> 02:28.221
Inform our hive to wait for us here,

02:28.221 --> 02:30.087
And under no circumstances

02:30.087 --> 02:32.688
Are they to activate their hyperdrive.

02:33.522 --> 02:34.421
Yes.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.488
Where are we going?

02:37.888 --> 02:38.955
Atlantis.

02:58.016 --> 03:00.417
I need you to get banks and her team

03:00.417 --> 03:03.151
To set up an auxiliary control
room below the damaged areas.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.084
They've already begun. how are you?

03:06.017 --> 03:07.017
I'm alive.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.250
You know, that's good for now.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.250
I still do not understand what happened.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.150
The gate blew up.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.650
That much I surmised.

03:14.650 --> 03:15.650
But why?

03:15.650 --> 03:17.517
I don't know.

03:17.517 --> 03:20.151
Where the hell's mckay
when you need him, huh?

03:24.750 --> 03:26.817
All right, so the device

03:26.817 --> 03:28.917
Creates a very specific
subspace "turbulence"

03:28.917 --> 03:30.117
That makes it impossible

03:30.117 --> 03:31.416
For the wraith to
operate their hyperdrives.

03:31.416 --> 03:32.383
You said that already.

03:32.383 --> 03:33.116
But there's a side effect.

03:33.116 --> 03:34.750
The "unforeseen" one
that janus mentions.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.017
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here

03:36.017 --> 03:37.184
Because there's no
stargate on this planet.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.984
What's the point, rodney?

03:38.684 --> 03:40.217
Although the subspace turbulence

03:40.217 --> 03:42.283
Only affects the wraith's
hyperdrive systems,

03:42.283 --> 03:45.116
It creates a very
dangerous type of radiation

03:45.116 --> 03:47.016
That, well...

03:47.016 --> 03:49.517
The messes with the basic
operation of the stargates.

03:49.517 --> 03:51.383
Stargates? what, as in all of them?

03:51.383 --> 03:53.317
All of the stargates in
the pegasus network, yes.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.317
And when you say "messes
with," you mean what?

03:55.317 --> 03:56.450
Look, when dialed,

03:56.450 --> 03:57.817
Power will build up inside the gate

03:57.817 --> 03:59.317
Until it overloads.

03:59.317 --> 04:01.050
So you're saying

04:01.050 --> 04:03.283
That as long as this
janus device is running,

04:03.283 --> 04:05.484
Every time someone dials a
gate in the entire galaxy--

04:05.484 --> 04:07.484
It'll explode.

04:07.484 --> 04:08.750
Millions of people will die

04:08.750 --> 04:10.983
If we don't shut that thing down.

04:22.684 --> 04:25.283
Good timing, mr. woolsey.

04:28.617 --> 04:32.983
Look, I don't know what
it is you think we've done,

04:32.983 --> 04:34.717
But I
assure you--

04:34.717 --> 04:36.250
Take us out of hyperspace.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.016
We haven't arrived at atlantis yet.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.884
Atlantis?

04:39.884 --> 04:41.650
We're within communications range.

04:41.650 --> 04:42.817
We don't want to get too close.

04:42.817 --> 04:44.150
Take us out.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.684
I was hoping you'd be awake for this.

04:51.983 --> 04:54.083
Well, are we up and running?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.116
Yes, sir.

04:55.116 --> 04:56.784
We've routed all the
city's main controls

04:56.784 --> 04:57.983
Into this room.

04:57.983 --> 04:59.150
At least we're not blind anymore.

04:59.150 --> 05:00.350
No, but we're severely crippled.

05:00.350 --> 05:01.484
Without the gate

05:01.484 --> 05:02.750
Or the ability to reach the daedalus,

05:02.750 --> 05:04.851
We have no way of getting to m6h-987

05:04.851 --> 05:07.217
Or rescuing rodney and dr. jackson.

05:07.217 --> 05:08.750
What should we do?

05:08.750 --> 05:11.150
5 bucks to anyone who figures
out how to contact  daedalus.

05:11.150 --> 05:12.817
Uh, colonel sheppard?

05:12.817 --> 05:14.817
You got an idea, banks?

05:14.817 --> 05:17.383
Well, no, but I am being hailed
by the  daedalus on subspace.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.217
Does that count?

05:20.217 --> 05:21.217
Technically that's not your idea,

05:21.217 --> 05:22.217
But good enough.

05:22.217 --> 05:25.250
Put 'em on screen.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.150
I'll pay you later.

05:28.150 --> 05:29.717
Daedalus, it's
good to, uh--

05:29.717 --> 05:31.717
Colonel sheppard.

05:31.717 --> 05:32.684
What the hell's going on?

05:32.684 --> 05:34.150
Where's caldwell?

05:34.150 --> 05:36.851
I'm afraid I had to relieve
him and his crew of duty.

05:36.851 --> 05:38.150
How close are they?

05:38.150 --> 05:40.016
Not close enough to go by jumper.

05:40.016 --> 05:40.917
Don't worry,

05:40.917 --> 05:42.016
I'm more than willing

05:42.016 --> 05:43.450
To return this ship and its crew to you.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.917
In exchange for what?

05:45.917 --> 05:48.250
You've activated the attero device.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.317
I need you to shut it down

05:50.317 --> 05:53.150
And give me its location immediately.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.116
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:55.116 --> 05:57.016
It was very clever of you,

05:57.016 --> 05:58.016
Luring me and my ship

05:58.016 --> 06:00.016
Out into the open

06:00.016 --> 06:01.884
So you could see for
yourself if it worked.

06:01.884 --> 06:04.350
If what worked?

06:04.350 --> 06:08.083
I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.817
I was there 10,000 years ago

06:09.817 --> 06:12.550
When the ancients first tried to use it,

06:12.550 --> 06:15.217
But they didn't have the
stomach to leave it on

06:15.217 --> 06:16.584
Once they realized

06:16.584 --> 06:18.784
How many of their precious stargates

06:18.784 --> 06:20.016
It would destroy...

06:20.016 --> 06:22.283
How many humans it would kill.

06:22.283 --> 06:23.951
Sounds like something
janus would have worked on.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.517
Give me the location
of the attero device,

06:26.517 --> 06:27.617
And once I have destroyed it,

06:27.617 --> 06:28.817
I will return this crew to you.

06:28.817 --> 06:30.817
Look, it's not what you think.

06:30.817 --> 06:32.517
We have nothing to do with this.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.484
Every minute that goes by

06:34.484 --> 06:37.217
Without you telling me
where this device is,

06:37.217 --> 06:41.951
I will kill a member of your expedition.

06:50.317 --> 06:52.684
Your time starts now.

06:52.684 --> 06:54.884
Give us a second.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.884
I don't think this should
count toward the minute.

07:00.084 --> 07:03.817
I-- I mean, he
didn't say no...

07:03.817 --> 07:05.517
Yet.

07:05.517 --> 07:08.283
What are the odds that--
what's this thing called?

07:08.283 --> 07:09.417
Uh, attero device.

07:09.417 --> 07:10.417
What are the odds

07:10.417 --> 07:11.584
That this thing was at the other end

07:11.584 --> 07:12.617
Of the subspace link that rodney opened

07:12.617 --> 07:13.584
When he went to that lab?

07:13.584 --> 07:15.550
M6h-987? very likely.

07:15.550 --> 07:16.784
It's also very likely

07:16.784 --> 07:18.183
That's where he and
dr. jackson were taken.

07:18.183 --> 07:19.584
It must be a weapon that janus developed

07:19.584 --> 07:20.717
During the wraith war.

07:20.717 --> 07:22.750
A weapon to blow up stargates?

07:22.750 --> 07:24.050
I doubt that was its original design.

07:24.050 --> 07:25.450
It doesn't seem like
an effective strategy.

07:25.450 --> 07:26.917
So, a nasty side effect.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.851
That's probably why
they stopped production.

07:28.851 --> 07:29.983
Whatever the aliens took from the lab

07:29.983 --> 07:31.617
Allowed them to reactivate it again.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.684
Whatever it is,

07:32.684 --> 07:33.851
Todd seems pretty keen to stop it,

07:33.851 --> 07:36.150
Enough to risk taking the  daedalus.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.650
Yes, but we can't give him the address.

07:37.650 --> 07:38.650
If he gets it,

07:38.650 --> 07:40.150
He'll destroy everything in his path,

07:40.150 --> 07:42.750
Including rodney and dr. jackson.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.484
John, we don't have a choice.

07:44.484 --> 07:45.750
Our shield was able

07:45.750 --> 07:47.150
To take the brunt of the explosion,

07:47.150 --> 07:48.584
But if this is happening
on other worlds,

07:49.784 --> 07:52.017
It could kill millions.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.550
Put 'em back on.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.217
Oh, thank god.

08:00.217 --> 08:02.417
We're not the ones behind this.

08:02.417 --> 08:03.250
Very well.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.983
W-w-wait!

08:05.983 --> 08:07.484
I said, we're not the ones behind this,

08:07.484 --> 08:09.584
But we may have what you need.

08:09.584 --> 08:11.550
Atlantis was attacked yesterday,

08:11.550 --> 08:13.484
By a race we have not
encountered before.

08:13.484 --> 08:15.851
They stole a piece
of ancient technology.

08:15.851 --> 08:17.851
We believe this could be a component

08:17.851 --> 08:19.884
To this attero device.

08:19.884 --> 08:21.117
We managed to track them.

08:21.117 --> 08:23.517
You swing by here, pick me up,
I will take you there myself.

08:23.517 --> 08:26.016
And give you the chance
to take out my hyperdrive

08:26.016 --> 08:27.417
With one of your drones?

08:27.417 --> 08:28.617
I think not.

08:28.617 --> 08:29.951
Why would I do that?

08:29.951 --> 08:31.067
Right now, you're one of

08:31.067 --> 08:32.183
the few people in the galaxy

08:32.183 --> 08:34.250
With a ship capable of
dealing with this problem.

08:34.250 --> 08:39.015
And I intend to keep it that way.

08:39.015 --> 08:43.183
John sheppard, transmit the coordinates

08:43.183 --> 08:45.750
Or I will feed on mr. woolsey

08:45.750 --> 08:49.917
Before your eyes!

08:51.517 --> 08:51.951
Do it.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.050
We have it.

08:57.050 --> 09:00.851
We'll be in touch.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.484
You really think that's going to work?

09:18.484 --> 09:20.217
You got a better idea?

09:20.217 --> 09:22.717
We're on a space ship.

09:22.717 --> 09:24.116
Those doors are designed to be airtight.

09:24.116 --> 09:25.784
That means something as tiny as air

09:25.784 --> 09:27.050
Can't even get through.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.317
How do you think you will?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.016
Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.

09:30.016 --> 09:32.550
Yeah... that's kind of my point.

09:35.217 --> 09:36.317
See?

09:36.317 --> 09:37.217
Ronon!

09:41.617 --> 09:42.851
You okay?

09:42.851 --> 09:43.851
Yeah.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.217
All right. come on.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.750
Wait. what's our plan?
where are we going?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.150
Get to an access ladder,

09:49.150 --> 09:50.584
Head down two floors to
the engineering rooms.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.717
Then we cripple the ship.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.684
You... know how to do all that?

09:54.684 --> 09:56.050
Yeah. don't you?

09:56.050 --> 09:57.851
Not really.

09:57.851 --> 09:59.484
Watch and learn.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.817
Hyperspace window opening.

10:06.817 --> 10:08.484
Think todd changed his mind?

10:08.484 --> 10:10.383
He might have realized
just how crippled we are.

10:10.383 --> 10:11.550
We're being hailed.

10:11.550 --> 10:13.150
Put it up.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.283
My name is katana
labrea. I'm a traveler.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.584
Larrin sent me.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.050
Well, is everything all right?

10:20.050 --> 10:22.717
No, as a matter of fact, it's not.

10:22.717 --> 10:24.150
Larrin was hoping you could tell us

10:24.150 --> 10:25.817
Why the stargates are blowing up.

10:36.337 --> 10:37.838
You. come with me.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.870
Me? why?

10:40.871 --> 10:42.871
Whoa. we'll both go. no need for that.

10:42.871 --> 10:43.571
No.

10:44.871 --> 10:46.771
I guess it... just must be your turn

10:46.771 --> 10:47.838
To use the fitness room.

10:47.838 --> 10:48.970
Right.

10:49.970 --> 10:52.171
Good luck.

10:52.171 --> 10:53.604
You too.

11:04.305 --> 11:05.571
It was the first colony we'd built

11:05.571 --> 11:06.738
On the surface of a planet

11:06.738 --> 11:07.738
In a hundred generations,

11:07.738 --> 11:10.004
And it was leveled in an instant.

11:10.004 --> 11:11.871
I was in orbit when it happened.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.838
We could see the explosion from space.

11:14.838 --> 11:17.771
I've never witnessed
anything that powerful.

11:17.771 --> 11:19.237
Mm. the gates are made of naquadah.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.771
When they become unstable,

11:20.771 --> 11:24.538
The size of the
explosion is unimaginable.

11:24.538 --> 11:25.571
We lost 3,000 people

11:25.571 --> 11:27.638
And two ships,

11:27.638 --> 11:29.937
Including our ancient vessel.

11:29.937 --> 11:31.538
Larrin would have
come herself, but--

11:31.538 --> 11:34.471
No, I'm sure she's got her hands full.

11:34.471 --> 11:38.171
Look, these aliens or whoever they are,

11:38.171 --> 11:40.271
They have two of our people hostage.

11:40.271 --> 11:41.438
They need to be stopped.

11:41.438 --> 11:45.471
We have coordinates,
but... we have no ship.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.904
Then I guess I got here just in time.

11:46.904 --> 11:48.371
That's what I wanted to hear.

11:48.371 --> 11:49.371
Zelenka, you're with me.

11:49.371 --> 11:50.538
John--

11:49.538 --> 11:51.805
Teyla, I need you to
stay here, all right?

11:51.805 --> 11:52.805
The second todd's done,

11:52.805 --> 11:53.704
There's nothing stopping him

11:53.704 --> 11:54.805
From turning that ship around

11:54.805 --> 11:56.171
And making a run at Atlantis.

11:56.171 --> 11:58.271
I need somebody I can trust
to stay in charge here.

11:59.471 --> 12:00.671
Good luck.

12:21.638 --> 12:23.438
I locked the door.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.771
This won't take long.

12:24.771 --> 12:26.171
So what do we do?

12:26.171 --> 12:27.337
Bring up the main control systems

12:27.337 --> 12:29.538
And disable them one by one?

12:29.538 --> 12:31.438
That's one way to go.

12:31.438 --> 12:33.104
Well, you'd have to lock them
out of the mainframe, though.

12:33.104 --> 12:34.805
Otherwise they could just
turn them back on again.

12:34.805 --> 12:36.871
Do you have some sort of a passcode

12:36.871 --> 12:37.937
To make sure they're locked out

12:37.937 --> 12:39.471
Once and for all?

12:39.471 --> 12:40.838
Nope.

12:40.838 --> 12:42.571
Well, then, what are you thinking?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.771
We just dropped out of hyperspace.

12:53.771 --> 12:55.471
I see that, yes.

12:55.471 --> 12:57.171
Why?

12:57.171 --> 12:58.438
I'm not sure.

12:58.438 --> 13:02.171
The computer seems to think
it's due to battle damage.

13:02.171 --> 13:04.537
Get our troops down to
the engineering room.

13:04.537 --> 13:06.670
Someone's sabotaging this ship.

13:11.537 --> 13:13.205
Wh-- what
are you doing?

13:13.205 --> 13:14.604
Disabling the ship.

13:14.604 --> 13:19.038
You can't just blast away
at vital systems like that!

13:19.038 --> 13:21.038
What if you take out
the life support system?

13:21.038 --> 13:22.071
Don't worry.

13:22.071 --> 13:24.437
The life support system is that tray.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.671
At least, I'm pretty sure it is.

13:26.771 --> 13:28.071
Okay, we're out of hyperspace.

13:28.071 --> 13:30.238
That's enough. come on.

13:45.971 --> 13:47.238
You wish to speak to me?

13:47.238 --> 13:49.604
You're the leader?

13:52.871 --> 13:55.637
You need to shut this
device down Immediately.

13:55.637 --> 13:59.470
No, I do not.

13:59.470 --> 14:02.104
Okay, look, I understand
wanting to destroy the wraith.

14:02.104 --> 14:03.138
I do.

14:03.138 --> 14:05.171
But this isn't the way.

14:05.171 --> 14:07.271
I disagree.

14:07.271 --> 14:09.437
Okay, I don't know if
you're aware of this or not,

14:09.437 --> 14:12.305
But this device has
a serious side effect.

14:12.305 --> 14:15.305
It makes stargates explode
when they're activated.

14:15.305 --> 14:17.637
We do not use the stargates.

14:17.637 --> 14:21.038
Okay.

14:21.038 --> 14:22.904
But lots of other people do.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.305
They are of no concern to us.

14:27.804 --> 14:29.305
So you're just going to let them die,

14:29.305 --> 14:31.704
Millions of people, across the galaxy?

14:34.337 --> 14:36.404
You're no better than the wraith.

14:36.404 --> 14:38.637
Perhaps. but we have little choice.

14:38.637 --> 14:39.771
Why?

14:39.771 --> 14:41.370
Our planet is dying.

14:41.370 --> 14:43.804
It can no longer sustain us.

14:43.804 --> 14:45.704
For the first time in
countless generations,

14:45.704 --> 14:48.071
We must venture out
into this galaxy again,

14:48.071 --> 14:50.071
A galaxy controlled by the wraith.

14:50.071 --> 14:53.671
If we do not destroy
them, they will destroy us.

14:53.671 --> 14:56.337
This is the way it must be.

15:02.004 --> 15:03.504
The wraith are ahead of us.

15:03.504 --> 15:04.838
As soon as they get to that planet,

15:04.838 --> 15:06.005
They'll open up with
everything they've got.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.438
Trust me, they ain't going to be
worried about collateral damage.

15:08.438 --> 15:10.104
The only chance we
have to save our friends

15:10.104 --> 15:11.571
Is to get there first.

15:11.571 --> 15:12.905
You want speed?

15:12.905 --> 15:14.838
You've come to the right place.

15:20.270 --> 15:22.171
This is your engineering room?

15:22.171 --> 15:23.205
That's right.

15:23.705 --> 15:24.571
It may not look like much,

15:24.571 --> 15:25.871
But trust me,

15:25.871 --> 15:27.604
We can outrun most anything
in the traveler fleet.

15:29.204 --> 15:30.837
Mila?

15:33.638 --> 15:36.004
This is colonel
sheppard and dr. zelenka.

15:36.004 --> 15:37.037
They're from atlantis.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.271
Mila's our chief engineer.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.204
She can't be more than 16 years old.

15:41.204 --> 15:42.037
15, actually.

15:42.037 --> 15:43.870
She's been working on ships

15:43.870 --> 15:46.271
Since she was four.

15:46.271 --> 15:49.004
We need to get where we're
going as fast as possible.

15:49.004 --> 15:50.204
I want you to do whatever you can

15:50.204 --> 15:51.904
To maximize hyperdrive output.

15:51.904 --> 15:53.237
No problem.

15:53.237 --> 15:54.404
You know, uh, zelenka

15:54.404 --> 15:57.137
Knows a thing or two
about hyperdrives himself.

15:57.137 --> 16:00.071
I'm sure he'd be happy
to give you a hand.

16:00.071 --> 16:01.104
Who knows,

16:01.104 --> 16:03.137
Maybe you'll learn a thing or two.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.171
The damage is significant.

16:16.171 --> 16:17.237
Begin repairs.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.671
Every second The
attero device is active,

16:19.671 --> 16:22.471
We risk losing more and
more of our alliance.

16:23.438 --> 16:24.738
It has come to my attention

16:24.738 --> 16:25.837
That someone from the original crew

16:25.837 --> 16:27.137
Has eluded capture.

16:27.137 --> 16:30.304
Your freedom has become a nuisance.

16:30.304 --> 16:31.904
Turn yourself in immediately

16:31.904 --> 16:33.271
Or we will begin
killing off your friends

16:33.571 --> 16:36.137
One by one.

16:36.137 --> 16:37.871
You have three minutes to comply.

16:37.871 --> 16:38.738
He's bluffing.

16:38.738 --> 16:39.604
No, he's not.

16:39.604 --> 16:40.537
Where are you going?

16:40.537 --> 16:41.638
I'm turning myself in.

16:41.638 --> 16:42.904
No, you're not.

16:42.904 --> 16:45.071
He's going to start killing people.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.071
He's going to kill you.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.804
Well, I hope not.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.037
We need to get armed,

16:49.037 --> 16:50.471
Free these people, and
take this ship back.

16:50.471 --> 16:51.371
Exactly.

16:51.371 --> 16:53.404
I turn myself in, and
he'll think he's got us all.

16:53.404 --> 16:54.738
It buys you the time you need

16:54.738 --> 16:55.904
To do what you've got to do.

16:55.904 --> 16:57.071
No. no, I'm not letting you do it.

16:57.071 --> 16:57.938
Ronon,
listen to me--

16:57.938 --> 16:58.771
Jennifer,

16:58.771 --> 17:00.071
No.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.904
Okay.

17:04.904 --> 17:06.170
You're right.

17:06.170 --> 17:07.404
Okay.

17:07.404 --> 17:08.404
Come on.

17:09.671 --> 17:12.170
We're almost there anyways.

17:19.771 --> 17:23.404
We're talking about the
deaths of millions of people.

17:24.570 --> 17:27.005
How can you be so callous?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.704
And what is it you're so afraid of?

17:29.704 --> 17:32.437
Why-- why are you still
in your battle armor?

17:32.437 --> 17:34.005
I can't hurt you.

17:35.005 --> 17:37.704
I know you're not human.

17:37.704 --> 17:38.871
You're definitely not wraith.

17:38.871 --> 17:40.871
And if you were an ancient,

17:40.871 --> 17:42.371
You wouldn't have needed our help

17:42.371 --> 17:43.838
To activate the device.

17:43.838 --> 17:46.704
So... what are you?

18:23.238 --> 18:24.204
you are asgard?

18:25.468 --> 18:27.534
You've encountered our kind before?

18:27.534 --> 18:29.434
No, not just encountered.

18:29.434 --> 18:31.067
I've worked with them,

18:31.067 --> 18:34.034
Even called a few of them my friends.

18:34.034 --> 18:35.434
Indeed.

18:35.434 --> 18:38.000
Of course, the asgard
I knew were a noble race

18:38.000 --> 18:39.501
Who actually helped the human population

18:39.501 --> 18:40.767
In my galaxy.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.267
And where are they now?

18:44.034 --> 18:45.034
Dead.

18:46.434 --> 18:48.434
But that had nothing to do with us.

18:48.434 --> 18:49.767
Are you certain?

18:49.767 --> 18:51.934
They were
clones--

18:51.934 --> 18:54.367
Copies of copies of copies,
going back generations,

18:54.367 --> 18:57.867
And they suffered irreversible
genetic degradation as a result.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.900
But you probably already know that.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.234
Of course,

19:01.234 --> 19:03.034
Because we are clones as well,

19:03.034 --> 19:05.334
Subject to the same law
of diminishing returns.

19:05.334 --> 19:08.568
And yet, we are still very much alive.

19:08.568 --> 19:10.401
So, what, you solved the problem?

19:10.401 --> 19:11.667
Not entirely.

19:11.667 --> 19:12.934
But once we were able

19:12.934 --> 19:14.800
To conduct our research
without interference,

19:14.800 --> 19:16.568
We made significant progress.

19:16.568 --> 19:19.934
Research on humans...

19:19.934 --> 19:21.733
Because our physiology is similar

19:21.733 --> 19:22.867
To what yours used to be.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.401
Precisely.

19:24.401 --> 19:25.633
I take that back.

19:25.633 --> 19:26.800
I have met an asgard like you before.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.434
His name was loki,

19:28.434 --> 19:31.000
And he was experimenting on humans too,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.401
Until he was caught

19:32.401 --> 19:35.034
And brought to justice by
the asgard high council.

19:35.034 --> 19:38.568
Because they did not believe
the ends justified the means.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.568
That's right.

19:40.568 --> 19:43.468
And look where it got them.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.501
Well, how's it coming?

19:56.867 --> 19:59.301
It does that sometimes.

19:59.301 --> 20:01.067
Don't let it bother you.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.401
Listen, what we are doing here

20:02.401 --> 20:03.434
Is not safe.

20:03.234 --> 20:04.634
What else is new?

20:04.634 --> 20:06.634
She is pushing this ship
well past its boundaries.

20:06.634 --> 20:08.467
That's kind of what we asked for, no?

20:08.467 --> 20:09.567
If we don't get rodney and danny back

20:09.567 --> 20:10.433
Before todd gets there,

20:10.433 --> 20:11.401
They're goners.

20:11.401 --> 20:13.034
This is the crudest hyperdrive system

20:13.034 --> 20:14.301
I've ever encountered.

20:14.301 --> 20:16.001
It is cobbled together
from mismatching components.

20:16.001 --> 20:17.901
She's got to be pretty smart
to put a hyperdrive together

20:17.901 --> 20:19.101
With mismatched parts.

20:19.101 --> 20:20.400
She's going to burn it up.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.967
Once out of hyperspace,
there's a high possibility

20:21.967 --> 20:24.001
We won't be able to
engage the drive again.

20:24.001 --> 20:25.901
Let's worry about
that when we get there.

20:25.834 --> 20:26.367
What was that?

20:28.867 --> 20:29.901
Just a radiation warning.

20:30.001 --> 20:32.834
The detector's a little over-sensitive.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.201
I wouldn't worry about it.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.433
I've got to get back to the bridge.

20:37.433 --> 20:38.467
I'll leave you to it.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.268
We came to this galaxy during the war.

20:45.268 --> 20:47.067
With both the wraith and
the ancients occupied,

20:47.067 --> 20:48.867
We were free to conduct our experiments.

20:48.867 --> 20:49.967
Unfortunately,

20:49.967 --> 20:51.134
The hostilities came to an end

20:51.134 --> 20:52.334
Sooner than we thought,

20:52.334 --> 20:55.001
And with an unexpected result.

20:55.001 --> 20:56.667
You were betting on the ancients.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.134
They may have tried to shut you down,

20:58.134 --> 21:00.834
But at least they
wouldn't exterminate you.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.268
The wraith do not tolerate

21:02.268 --> 21:03.867
The presence of advanced technologies

21:03.867 --> 21:05.600
Other than their own.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.700
Before we knew what was happening,

21:06.700 --> 21:08.433
We were under attack.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.867
We lost our intergalactic
ships in the first battle,

21:10.867 --> 21:12.201
And we did not have the resources

21:12.201 --> 21:13.368
To build more.

21:13.368 --> 21:15.533
So how did you survive?

21:15.533 --> 21:16.700
We had no choice

21:16.700 --> 21:17.967
But to abandon our settlements

21:17.967 --> 21:19.467
And retreat to a place

21:19.467 --> 21:21.334
Where the wraith could not look for us,

21:21.334 --> 21:25.467
A planet with a toxic atmosphere.

21:25.467 --> 21:28.400
Oh. that... sounds nice.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.700
It was tolerable at first.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.867
We were able to survive

21:31.867 --> 21:34.167
Using simple breathing apparatus.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.467
But over the eons,

21:35.467 --> 21:37.901
The environment has grown so harsh

21:37.901 --> 21:39.734
That not even our armored exoskeletons

21:39.734 --> 21:42.167
Can protect us now.

21:42.167 --> 21:43.533
So you ventured back into the galaxy,

21:43.533 --> 21:45.667
And that's when you
came across this place.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.767
We knew it was built by
the ancients, and why,

21:48.767 --> 21:50.134
But we were unable to activate it

21:50.134 --> 21:52.368
Until you came along.

21:52.368 --> 21:54.101
Look, i--
I'm sorry

21:54.101 --> 21:56.067
That you were trapped
on a poisonous planet

21:56.067 --> 21:57.368
For the last 10,000 years.

21:57.368 --> 21:58.400
I really am.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.800
I'm sure it was awful.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.433
But that doesn't justify
what you're doing.

22:02.433 --> 22:04.800
My people are dying.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.667
The fact that, as you tell us,
our brothers are already gone,

22:08.667 --> 22:10.734
Only reinforces the need.

22:10.734 --> 22:13.667
If we do not do this,
our whole civilization,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.867
A hundred thousand years of history,

22:15.867 --> 22:18.400
Will be wiped out forever.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.800
I cannot allow that to happen.

22:25.334 --> 22:28.867
Dr. keller.

22:28.867 --> 22:31.201
You're the saboteur?

22:31.201 --> 22:33.967
That's right.

22:35.134 --> 22:37.201
Where's your weapon?

22:37.201 --> 22:38.034
My weapon?

22:38.034 --> 22:39.433
Yes.

22:39.433 --> 22:42.034
The one you used to
destroy the crystal trays.

22:44.067 --> 22:45.800
I ditched it.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.967
You really think I'd want
it ending up in your hands?

22:47.967 --> 22:51.934
Oh, it's foolish of you
to see me as the enemy.

22:51.934 --> 22:53.467
Really? why's that?

22:53.467 --> 22:56.134
I'm on a mission from
your colonel sheppard.

22:56.134 --> 22:58.767
I seriously doubt that.

22:58.767 --> 23:00.334
It is a long story,

23:00.334 --> 23:01.734
But he has requested

23:01.734 --> 23:04.167
That we neutralize a
very dangerous target.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.234
Then why did you take over the ship?

23:06.234 --> 23:07.767
Why did you attack our crew?

23:07.767 --> 23:11.800
As I said, it is a long story.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.467
The mission, however,
is time-sensitive,

23:13.467 --> 23:15.167
And you have handed us a major setback.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.700
Hyperdrive,
weapons, shields--

23:17.700 --> 23:20.400
They are all down.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.467
That's a real shame.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.700
It is

23:22.700 --> 23:24.901
Considering that hundreds of thousands

23:24.901 --> 23:26.634
Of humans

23:26.634 --> 23:29.067
Could die because of it.

23:29.067 --> 23:31.600
I would think that will
weigh heavily on you

23:31.600 --> 23:32.533
In the future.

23:32.533 --> 23:34.500
What are you talking about?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.134
Hyperdrive's coming back up.

23:37.134 --> 23:38.467
And weapons?

23:38.467 --> 23:42.201
Irreparably damaged. they're
no good to us anymore.

23:42.201 --> 23:44.600
I guess you won't be able
to finish the mission, then.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.533
Oh, we'll find a way.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.368
Get us back into hyperspace

23:54.368 --> 23:57.001
And get her down with the others.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.001
You okay?

24:20.001 --> 24:21.400
I thought you were a goner.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.533
I'm all right.

24:22.533 --> 24:24.067
I mean, they need me.
you're kind of expendable.

24:24.067 --> 24:25.467
I just
figured--

24:25.467 --> 24:26.400
Yeah, I got what you meant by "goner".

24:26.400 --> 24:27.301
What did they want?

24:27.301 --> 24:29.234
Uh, to talk, actually.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.433
Oh. how did that go?

24:31.433 --> 24:32.567
They're asgard.

24:32.767 --> 24:33.867
For real?

24:33.867 --> 24:35.101
Yeah, a faction that broke
off from the guys we knew

24:35.101 --> 24:36.433
Thousands of years ago.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.301
They're the ones inside the suits.

24:38.301 --> 24:40.201
I did not see that one coming.

24:40.201 --> 24:41.967
Apparently no fans
of the wraith, either.

24:41.967 --> 24:43.867
Are they going to shut off the device?

24:43.867 --> 24:45.268
Um, no.

24:45.268 --> 24:46.201
Then I don't care.

24:46.201 --> 24:47.234
As long as that thing is on,

24:47.234 --> 24:48.634
Then millions of people could die.

24:48.634 --> 24:50.500
Besides, I think I've
figured a way out of here.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.268
Really?

24:52.268 --> 24:54.600
This is an ancient facility,

24:54.600 --> 24:55.934
And rodney mckay knows a thing or two

24:55.934 --> 24:57.301
About ancient facilities.

24:57.301 --> 24:58.368
It has been
clinically proven--

24:58.368 --> 24:59.433
Referring to yourself
in the third person

24:59.433 --> 25:01.268
Is a sign of mental instability.

25:01.268 --> 25:03.934
Mentally unstable like a fox!

25:03.934 --> 25:06.101
Okay, so, here's the plan.

25:06.101 --> 25:07.533
I blow the fire-monitoring fuse.

25:07.533 --> 25:08.834
The system suddenly goes dead,

25:08.834 --> 25:10.234
It assumes there could be a fire,

25:10.234 --> 25:11.533
Detects lifesigns inside the room,

25:11.533 --> 25:13.734
It unlocks the doors for safety.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.533
Good job.

25:20.533 --> 25:22.134
Good thing they brought
you back when they did,

25:22.134 --> 25:23.467
Because I assumed you were dead

25:23.467 --> 25:24.500
And I was going to leave.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.667
Lucky me.Yeah, you're welcome

25:26.034 --> 25:28.201
So, what do we do now?

25:28.201 --> 25:29.667
We've got to shut down the device.

25:29.667 --> 25:30.901
How do we do that?

25:30.901 --> 25:34.567
We'll just... we'll improvise.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.068
Right.

25:59.867 --> 26:01.034
Todd didn't kill you.

26:01.034 --> 26:04.201
No, but you almost got me killed.

26:04.201 --> 26:05.400
I've never fired one of these

26:05.400 --> 26:06.800
Outside of the range before.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.334
You did great.

26:18.767 --> 26:20.467
Ronon. good work.

26:20.467 --> 26:21.367
It's not over yet.

26:21.367 --> 26:22.500
There's an armory down the hall.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.367
We need everyone we can.

26:24.367 --> 26:25.967
we're taking the ship back

26:30.109 --> 26:31.076
we'll get to the device control room

26:31.109 --> 26:32.376
you're calling the soldiers

26:32.409 --> 26:33.376
then we'll create a diversion

26:34.109 --> 26:35.776
Okay, uh, we go to the
power relay station,

26:35.776 --> 26:37.209
We create a massive explosion.

26:37.209 --> 26:39.776
I never got how that
made a good diversion.

26:39.776 --> 26:40.977
What?

26:40.977 --> 26:42.543
You want to clear the device
control room of bad guys, right?

26:42.543 --> 26:43.776
Yes.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.276
Why assume if there
was a massive explosion

26:45.276 --> 26:46.276
People would run towards it?

26:46.276 --> 26:47.276
I would.

26:47.276 --> 26:48.710
I rest my case.

26:48.710 --> 26:50.109
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a good person.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.576
I'd want to save people from the fire,

26:51.576 --> 26:52.710
Maybe figure out what was going on.

26:52.710 --> 26:54.610
I'd order more guards
to protect the one room

26:54.610 --> 26:56.477
I thought whoever is blowing things up

26:56.477 --> 26:57.876
Probably wants to get to.

26:59.943 --> 27:01.176
Explosion diversions

27:01.176 --> 27:02.676
Are the very cornerstone of diversions.

27:02.676 --> 27:03.977
You don't have any better ideas?

27:03.977 --> 27:05.276
I don't have any better ideas, yes.

27:05.276 --> 27:06.376
Oh, my god. please don't kill me.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.076
You need me.

27:07.076 --> 27:07.910
Rodney?

27:07.910 --> 27:08.977
Us, us. you need us.

27:08.977 --> 27:10.243
The device needs constant care.

27:10.243 --> 27:11.943
True, I'm the only one
who knows how to work it--

27:11.943 --> 27:13.076
What am I talking about killing for?

27:13.076 --> 27:13.943
You're not a violent race.

27:13.943 --> 27:14.776
You may have
stunned us--

27:14.776 --> 27:15.743
Rodney.

27:15.743 --> 27:17.076
...more than we'd
have liked, but--

27:17.076 --> 27:18.243
They're just suits.

27:18.243 --> 27:20.776
Suits that house one of
the smartest races ever.

27:20.776 --> 27:21.977
I've always been a
big fan of the asgards.

27:21.977 --> 27:23.476
Some of my best
friends are asgards--

27:23.476 --> 27:24.443
They're empty suits.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.710
See?

27:27.743 --> 27:28.943
Yeah. I
know. I was--

27:28.943 --> 27:29.877
You were...

27:29.877 --> 27:30.843
Yeah, it's not important.

27:31.843 --> 27:33.576
From what I could tell,

27:33.576 --> 27:35.910
The inside of the suits form
around whoever's in them.

27:35.910 --> 27:37.810
One size fits all...

27:49.843 --> 27:52.710
You sure you have all that figured out?

27:52.710 --> 27:55.709
I've flown birds a lot harder
to manage than this one.

27:56.209 --> 27:59.743
I'm surprised larrin
didn't say anything.

27:59.743 --> 28:01.276
Larrin's never brought
you up before today.

28:01.276 --> 28:03.576
Really? never, huh?

28:04.576 --> 28:05.743
Nope.

28:07.943 --> 28:09.810
We're about to come out of hyperspace.

28:09.810 --> 28:11.142
Everyone, get ready.

28:26.376 --> 28:28.009
See, I knew this would happen.

28:28.009 --> 28:29.343
We burned it out.

28:29.343 --> 28:31.209
We got here, though, didn't we?

28:34.676 --> 28:36.009
Any sign of the  daedalus?

28:36.009 --> 28:38.977
No. looks like we beat them.

28:38.977 --> 28:41.543
That's the first good
news I've had all day.

28:41.543 --> 28:42.676
Wait,

28:42.676 --> 28:44.443
I've got two ships closing in.

28:44.443 --> 28:45.877
Shields up.

28:45.877 --> 28:47.476
Fire at will.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.977
Evasive maneuvers might be good.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.676
I'm on it.

29:06.843 --> 29:08.409
Clear!

29:08.409 --> 29:09.776
How come we haven't run
into any of them yet?

29:09.776 --> 29:11.643
I've got a bad feeling about this.

29:11.643 --> 29:12.643
Do a lifesigns scan,

29:12.643 --> 29:13.843
Find out where they are.

29:17.076 --> 29:20.943
I have a mass of lifesigns
in the second 302 bay.

29:20.943 --> 29:22.810
They fell back to their
ship. it's still in the bay.

29:22.810 --> 29:24.343
Why would they do that?

29:24.343 --> 29:25.510
They saw we'd armed up?

29:25.510 --> 29:26.877
Didn't want to risk a fight?

29:26.877 --> 29:28.142
That doesn't sound like todd.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.576
I'm going to check it out.

29:29.576 --> 29:31.576
Take us out of hyperspace.

29:35.376 --> 29:36.743
What is it?

29:36.743 --> 29:38.376
They locked us out of flight controls.

29:38.376 --> 29:39.843
Can you get us back in?

29:39.843 --> 29:41.576
Not quickly.

29:41.576 --> 29:43.877
What's he got planned?

29:53.776 --> 29:56.477
Okay, how long to get
the device shut down?

29:56.877 --> 29:58.910
Five minutes.

29:58.910 --> 30:01.910
All right, look.
you watch the--

30:01.910 --> 30:02.610
Oh, come on!

30:02.610 --> 30:03.643
What? what now?

30:03.643 --> 30:04.843
Well, something must have spooked them.

30:04.843 --> 30:05.510
Why?

30:05.510 --> 30:07.743
Well, aside from encrypting the
access to this workstation...

30:07.743 --> 30:09.076
Yeah, but you can break that.

30:09.076 --> 30:10.510
Yeah, in a heartbeat, but,
as they very well know,

30:10.510 --> 30:13.109
You can't operate this machine
without the control key.

30:13.109 --> 30:16.276
Look-- the thing they
stole from janus' lab

30:16.276 --> 30:17.810
To begin with.

30:17.810 --> 30:19.309
They've taken it.

30:38.643 --> 30:40.443
One down, one to go.

30:40.443 --> 30:42.409
I'm picking up a third
ship headed right for us.

30:42.409 --> 30:43.910
Wonderful.

30:55.276 --> 30:57.610
That was close. it flew into hyperspace.

30:57.610 --> 30:58.476
What?

30:58.476 --> 31:00.610
Hold on,I've got another window opening.

31:00.610 --> 31:02.109
They're coming right back at us.

31:02.109 --> 31:04.443
What kind of messed-up
battle technique is that?

31:04.443 --> 31:05.576
It's quite a bit out,

31:05.576 --> 31:07.743
Nowhere near the planet yet.

31:07.743 --> 31:10.309
Wait... it's the  daedalus.

31:11.443 --> 31:13.009
Contact them.

31:13.009 --> 31:14.977
We're going to need the help.

31:14.977 --> 31:16.810
Colonel sheppard?

31:16.810 --> 31:18.409
Surprised to see all of you guys.

31:18.409 --> 31:19.843
Same here.

31:19.843 --> 31:22.243
Look, I'm on
a travelers--

31:22.243 --> 31:24.243
I'm on a travelers ship.

31:24.243 --> 31:25.977
We've engaged the enemy.

31:25.977 --> 31:27.309
Have you gotten the  daedalus back?

31:27.309 --> 31:28.877
Because we're going to need the help.

31:28.877 --> 31:30.476
Todd let us take her back
without so much as a fight.

31:30.476 --> 31:31.843
But he's locked us out of the controls

31:31.843 --> 31:33.676
And retreated to one of the 302 bays.

31:33.676 --> 31:35.877
Why the hell would he do that?

31:35.877 --> 31:38.309
He needs that place
destroyed more than anyone.

31:38.309 --> 31:39.543
Mr. woolsey, sir?

31:39.543 --> 31:40.943
What is it, marks?

31:40.943 --> 31:43.042
Sir, the second we
came out of hyperspace,

31:43.042 --> 31:45.009
A pre-programmed
sub-routine kicked in.

31:45.009 --> 31:46.643
Meaning...

31:46.643 --> 31:47.810
Our main scanners located
a facility on the planet

31:47.810 --> 31:51.376
And immediately locked the
guidance system into it.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.209
It's taking us to the attero device.

31:53.209 --> 31:54.610
In a way...

31:54.610 --> 31:56.710
Sir, it's programmed a collision course.

31:58.209 --> 32:00.176
That's how he's going
to destroy the facility,

32:00.176 --> 32:01.643
By ramming us into it.

32:07.517 --> 32:09.351
Can't we just power
down the entire facility?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.593
You can't do much more than
turn the lights off and on

32:11.593 --> 32:12.593
Without the component thing.

32:12.593 --> 32:14.094
We have to do something.

32:14.094 --> 32:15.061
Wait a second.

32:15.061 --> 32:16.394
These suits were designed

32:16.394 --> 32:17.627
To protect the wearer from
harsh environments, right?

32:17.627 --> 32:19.494
Technically, yes.

32:19.494 --> 32:21.627
Then I have a really terrible idea.

32:22.627 --> 32:23.627
Oh, no, no.

32:23.627 --> 32:24.593
You're not thinking

32:24.593 --> 32:27.194
What I think you're thinking.

32:27.194 --> 32:29.593
The radiation in there
would be pretty extreme.

32:29.593 --> 32:30.927
Not to mention those
electrical discharges

32:30.927 --> 32:32.960
Look pretty unfriendly, but...

32:33.160 --> 32:35.227
Yeah, but the antenna
has a control crystal.

32:35.227 --> 32:36.394
If we could pull it manually...

32:36.394 --> 32:37.960
It's 50-50 we even get that far.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.394
I'd go 30-70,

32:39.394 --> 32:40.661
But I don't have a better idea,

32:40.661 --> 32:42.394
And the suits, they should protect us.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.628
We disabled the ship weapons.

32:48.628 --> 32:49.427
You did?

32:49.427 --> 32:52.060
Ronon did, yeah.

32:52.060 --> 32:53.227
They didn't have any other choice.

32:53.227 --> 32:54.461
Ramming the facility with the ship

32:54.461 --> 32:56.661
Is the only sure-fire
way to take it out.

32:56.661 --> 32:59.094
Killing all of us in the process.

32:59.094 --> 33:01.661
I don't think he's
that worried about us.

33:01.661 --> 33:03.760
They just depressurized the 302 bay.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.760
You ready?

33:16.760 --> 33:18.960
Let's just get this over with.

33:22.461 --> 33:24.494
You know we both don't
have to go in there.

33:24.494 --> 33:26.127
Well, when you get killed

33:26.127 --> 33:27.461
By one of those discharges,

33:27.461 --> 33:29.227
Someone's going to have
to finish the job, so...

33:29.227 --> 33:31.860
Oh, great pep talk. thanks.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.461
I'm pretty sure

33:52.461 --> 33:54.427
We want to avoid those touching us.

33:54.427 --> 33:55.361
Thanks, coach.

34:19.793 --> 34:21.360
What are you waiting for?

34:22.927 --> 34:23.827
I have to pull the right one

34:23.827 --> 34:26.994
Or the antenna explodes.

34:27.960 --> 34:28.960
Hurry up.

34:33.628 --> 34:35.127
But get it right.

34:38.261 --> 34:40.261
How long before the
daedalus hits the surface?

34:40.261 --> 34:41.893
A minute, tops.

34:41.893 --> 34:42.860
How many people on board?

34:42.860 --> 34:45.194
Couple hundred.

34:45.194 --> 34:47.628
Look, I've got an idea,
but you'll have to trust me.

34:47.628 --> 34:48.927
All right.

34:48.927 --> 34:51.628
Zelenka, Mila...

34:51.628 --> 34:52.860
I need you to open up the hyperdrive

34:52.860 --> 34:54.094
In 30 seconds.

34:54.094 --> 34:55.527
We're going to have
to make a short jump.

34:55.527 --> 34:56.360
Impossible.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.927
Not a problem.

34:59.027 --> 35:01.261
You can do this, marks.

35:01.261 --> 35:02.394
We're all counting on you.

35:02.394 --> 35:04.494
I've almost got it.

35:06.461 --> 35:08.394
We're entering the atmosphere.

35:20.628 --> 35:23.060
Marks...

35:41.561 --> 35:43.094
Okay.

35:43.094 --> 35:45.261
Here goes nothing.

35:48.994 --> 35:49.994
Daniel!

36:00.361 --> 36:01.994
What just happened?

36:01.994 --> 36:03.160
You're welcome.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.793
What did you do?

36:04.793 --> 36:06.294
I just opened up a hyperspace window

36:06.294 --> 36:08.594
Big enough for the both of us.

36:08.594 --> 36:12.294
We just traveled through the planet.

36:12.294 --> 36:14.760
i got it.I'm back in.

36:14.760 --> 36:15.960
We've got control of the ship.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.893
And not a moment too late.

36:18.893 --> 36:20.760
They found us again.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.261
Give them everything you've got.

36:34.294 --> 36:35.294
Okay.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.694
You're okay, you're okay.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.060
Wrong again.

36:42.893 --> 36:44.427
Did you turn it off?

36:44.427 --> 36:46.661
I did-- we
did-- you did.

36:46.661 --> 36:47.893
Look, where does it hurt?

36:49.661 --> 36:50.960
Everywhere.

36:52.728 --> 36:55.327
I don't suppose there's
a hospital nearby?

36:55.327 --> 36:58.461
I'm-- I'm pretty
sure we're on our own.

36:58.461 --> 37:00.261
Good.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.860
Look, on the bright side,

37:02.860 --> 37:05.860
We'll both be dead of
dehydration in, like, five days,

37:05.860 --> 37:07.628
So you won't have to put
up with me for much longer.

37:07.628 --> 37:11.960
I'm, uh, I'm pretty busted up, rodney.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.461
I don't... I don't think I'm
going to make it that long.

37:15.461 --> 37:17.694
Okay, um, I know it
may not seem like it,

37:17.694 --> 37:21.827
But I want you to
know I really res--

37:26.494 --> 37:27.760
Oh, thank god.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.427
I sure am glad to see you two.

37:29.427 --> 37:31.427
He's badly hurt.

37:32.827 --> 37:34.827
That's a new look for you.

37:34.827 --> 37:36.361
Well, you know me,

37:36.361 --> 37:38.893
It's function over fashion.

37:38.893 --> 37:40.361
Is the device still active?

37:40.361 --> 37:41.960
Not without this.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.694
It's the facility's
main control crystal.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.027
That's not good enough for me.

37:45.027 --> 37:47.361
Colonel sheppard,

37:47.361 --> 37:49.760
We have drs. mckay and jackson.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.060
Our weapons are not operational.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.361
Can you please see to it

37:52.361 --> 37:53.527
That we never have to deal

37:53.527 --> 37:54.994
With the attero device again?

37:54.994 --> 37:56.194
I'm locked on to its coordinates.

37:56.194 --> 37:57.793
Opening fire.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.327
Leveled.

38:09.327 --> 38:11.561
Good.

38:11.561 --> 38:12.760
Let's go home.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.494
Well, you want to... unzip me?

38:15.494 --> 38:17.893
I'll look for a can opener.

38:26.394 --> 38:28.394
Zelenka has been a big
help with ship repairs.

38:28.394 --> 38:30.260
We should have her
ready to fly in no time.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.327
Then what?

38:31.327 --> 38:33.527
Start a new settlement, I guess.

38:33.527 --> 38:34.727
That's good to hear.

38:34.727 --> 38:35.894
You tell larrin I'll help you

38:35.894 --> 38:37.160
With whatever you need.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.160
Thank you.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.293
We'll be in touch.

38:39.293 --> 38:41.460
Yeah. I'm sure you will be.

38:41.460 --> 38:42.861
Tell larrin she doesn't need to wait

38:42.861 --> 38:45.727
For the next galactic
emergency To drop by.

38:45.727 --> 38:47.827
I'm a lot more charming

38:47.827 --> 38:49.527
When my friends aren't about to die.

38:49.527 --> 38:50.827
That's not what larrin said.

38:50.827 --> 38:53.494
See, she does talk about me!

38:53.494 --> 38:55.560
Every now and again.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.227
What does she say?

38:59.694 --> 39:01.661
What, not even a hint?

39:05.761 --> 39:07.594
Hey.

39:07.594 --> 39:09.761
Hey.

39:09.761 --> 39:11.861
You all done for the day?

39:11.861 --> 39:15.260
Uh, dr. cole's taking my shift. yeah.

39:15.260 --> 39:16.293
Want to get something to eat?

39:16.293 --> 39:18.661
Um, listen,

39:18.661 --> 39:21.661
Um, I'm really glad
you came on the mission.

39:21.661 --> 39:26.028
I mean, without you there,
we'd... probably all be dead.

39:27.128 --> 39:29.394
But...

39:29.394 --> 39:33.827
I just want to be clear, because, um...

39:37.894 --> 39:39.560
I just want you to know,

39:39.560 --> 39:45.894
That, uh, I'm kind of...
interested in somebody else.

39:45.894 --> 39:48.061
So?

39:48.061 --> 39:50.727
I just didn't want to
give you the wrong--

39:50.727 --> 39:53.827
Didn't. I just, um, wanted
to get something to eat.

39:53.827 --> 39:56.360
Okay, because
I thought--

39:56.360 --> 39:58.160
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

40:01.494 --> 40:03.927
Okay.

40:03.927 --> 40:06.193
Okay.

40:07.661 --> 40:09.128
Do you still
want to go--

40:09.128 --> 40:12.961
Uh, no. I should probably...

40:15.394 --> 40:16.927
I should go.

40:23.594 --> 40:25.627
Hey.

40:26.627 --> 40:27.694
How are you?

40:27.994 --> 40:29.560
Well, it hurts to eat this fruit cup.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.761
Don't eat the fruit cup, then.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.627
Thank you, groucho.

40:32.627 --> 40:34.160
Listen, not that I don't
appreciate the visits,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.394
But shouldn't you be
trying to figure out a way

40:36.394 --> 40:37.961
To keep the asgards
out of the shield again?

40:37.961 --> 40:39.927
One step ahead of you.
that won't happen again.

40:39.927 --> 40:42.028
Oh. good.

40:42.028 --> 40:43.560
You don't think they'd
make a run at us again?

40:43.560 --> 40:44.961
Well, I'm not sure,

40:44.961 --> 40:46.627
But we did ruin the one plan they had

40:46.627 --> 40:47.794
To feel free in this galaxy.

40:47.794 --> 40:49.861
They might hold a grudge.

40:49.861 --> 40:51.627
Well, let's hope not.

40:51.627 --> 40:53.427
I don't think I'll be
around to find out, though.

40:53.427 --> 40:54.994
Yeah, I heard they're
sending you back to earth.

40:54.994 --> 40:58.128
Yeah, I guess I need some
major patching up and recovery.

40:58.128 --> 40:59.527
Landry prefers I do that
there instead of here, so...

40:59.527 --> 41:00.994
The daedalus has
already picked up a gate

41:00.994 --> 41:02.661
Left over from the old gate bridge,

41:02.661 --> 41:04.761
And my team is
installing it as we speak,

41:04.761 --> 41:06.293
So we should have you home in no time.

41:06.293 --> 41:07.360
That's good.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.627
That is good.

41:09.627 --> 41:11.293
Yes. so...

41:13.727 --> 41:16.894
Well, it's been... unique.

41:16.894 --> 41:19.994
Yes, it has. it sure has.

41:19.994 --> 41:21.727
But I do want to say thank you

41:21.727 --> 41:24.661
For, um, saying that you respected me

41:24.661 --> 41:27.160
When you thought I was
about to die back there.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.460
Excuse me? I said no such thing.

41:28.460 --> 41:29.427
Yeah, you did.

41:29.427 --> 41:30.427
You were, like, um,

41:30.427 --> 41:31.961
"i know it may not seem like it,

41:31.961 --> 41:33.028
But I really respect you,"

41:33.028 --> 41:36.227
And that means a great deal to me.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.028
I don't believe I ever
finished that sentence.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.460
How else would you have
finished that sentence?

41:40.460 --> 41:41.894
I would have said "regret."

41:41.894 --> 41:45.128
I would have said I really
regret you being here

41:45.128 --> 41:47.460
Because none of this
would have happened...

41:47.460 --> 41:48.460
Otherwise.

41:51.661 --> 41:53.594
So you can only give
compliments to the dying?

41:53.594 --> 41:57.128
It's something I'm working on.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.761
Do you want to try any of this?

41:59.761 --> 42:00.761
Ooh, fries.

42:00.761 --> 42:01.761
Yeah, yeah.

42:01.761 --> 42:04.761
Dive right in, take
the-- take the deal there.
