00:08.258 --> 00:09.718
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.801 --> 00:11.594
Tall Boy? We know
you're working for Hiram.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.805
Why would he want the town quarantined?

00:13.888 --> 00:17.225
-Apparently there was a mass seizure.
Seizures aren't contagious.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.351
So, what?

00:18.435 --> 00:20.645
There's nowhere he won't follow me.
It's over?

00:20.729 --> 00:25.025
You will stoop to any level
to get me back in your clutches.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.235
I just wanted some father-daughter time.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.361
Claudius Blossom.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.989
You may not be the Man in Black,
but his stink is on you.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.700
Sheriff Minetta's body was found
in the marsh last night.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.993
It was decapitated.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.163
No, Tall Boy was just trying to escape.
It was an accident.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.623
As far as anyone knows,
Tall Boy's been exiled.

00:46.838 --> 00:50.216
<i>Riverdale,</i>
<i>once a safe, decent, innocent place,</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:52.010
<i>had become Noir Town,</i>

00:52.093 --> 00:54.304
<i>like the setting</i>
<i>of a Raymond Chandler story,</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:58.433
<i>filled with dames to kill for,</i>
<i>postmen who like to ring twice,</i>

00:58.600 --> 00:59.559
<i>and more mobsters</i>

00:59.642 --> 01:01.770
<i>than a Scorsese retrospective</i>
<i>at the Bijou.</i>

01:02.771 --> 01:05.899
<i>We were a town of lost souls.</i>
<i>Each of us wrestling with demons.</i>

01:06.357 --> 01:08.818
<i>Each of us with secrets</i>
<i>we were trying to keep.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:11.362
<i>Mine was on the large side.</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:13.364
<i>Six-foot-five to be exact.</i>

01:13.448 --> 01:14.824
Explain it to me once more.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
We drove him to the bus station
at gunpoint,

01:17.160 --> 01:19.788
-got him on a bus out of town.
-He murdered Joaquin.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.165
You thought putting him on a bus
was enough punishment?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.042
-I don't buy it.
-I made a decision.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.336
I'm sorry you don't agree, but he's gone.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.673
I'll pretend
like I believe you idiots for now.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.469
I got my hands full
finding Hiram's would-be assassin.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.348
Next time you see me, have a better story.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.936
<i>I was covering up the death</i>
<i>of a wicked man.</i>

01:43.019 --> 01:46.356
<i>But Tall Boy Petite wasn't</i>
<i>the only fresh corpse in Noir Town.</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:49.025
<i>Claudius Blossom had taken the big sleep,</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:51.986
<i>and my girlfriend, Betty Cooper,</i>
<i>had murder on the brain.</i>

01:52.070 --> 01:55.573
<i>And murderers, in Betty's world,</i>
<i>needed to be brought to justice.</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:57.283
It's infuriating, Dad.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.079
<i>The Lodge Ledger</i> is calling
Claudius Blossom's death a suicide,

02:01.162 --> 02:04.582
-but I think he was murdered.
-But if he ingested cyanide--

02:04.666 --> 02:06.584
But how did it get in his prison cell?

02:07.001 --> 02:10.213
A gift from his former partner-in-crime
Penelope, I'm guessing?

02:10.296 --> 02:11.631
Poison does suit her.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.008
Subtle, elegant.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.804
But if nobody else is asking questions
about Claudius' death,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.139
why are you?

02:19.222 --> 02:23.268
Because it's black and white,
and wrong, Dad.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.603
Penelope's been killing people for years.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.273
She's literally getting away with murder.

02:28.356 --> 02:32.485
Daryl Doiley was poisoned with oleander,
which is something only the Blossoms grow.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.195
Featherhead, poisoned.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.822
The nuns, poisoned.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.282
And now Claudius.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.117
I just can't prove any of it.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.162
It's like she's committed
the perfect murders.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.207
You've already found the pattern,
murders disguised as suicides.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.586
Who else has died by suicide
near Penelope?

02:49.669 --> 02:50.670
Think now.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.088
Clifford.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.090
But he hung himself.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.091
Perhaps.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.760
I wonder, though,
if that's the whole story.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.430
Who was there that night?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.016
Penelope.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.603
And Cheryl.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.396
If there's a witness,

03:09.230 --> 03:10.565
it's not a perfect murder.

03:12.817 --> 03:17.322
<i>Meanwhile, Archie Andrews</i>
<i>no longer felt hunted by Hiram Lodge,</i>

03:17.697 --> 03:18.948
<i>but he was still haunted.</i>

03:19.032 --> 03:21.576
<i>Trapped in that in-between place,</i>

03:21.659 --> 03:24.495
<i>avoiding his destined face-to-face</i>
<i>with the Man in Black,</i>

03:24.579 --> 03:27.165
<i>Archie struggled,</i>
<i>searching for a sense of purpose.</i>

03:27.665 --> 03:28.833
What's going on, son?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.961
-No, Dad, it's not...

03:35.215 --> 03:36.174
I've been thinking.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.469
Maybe college isn't for me.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.640
Maybe I can work with you
in the construction company again.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.228
Well, there's no shame in hard work,
son, but where's this coming from?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.980
After the crap I've seen
these last few months,

03:51.064 --> 03:54.025
I just wanna get out of my head,
work with my hands,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.319
try and make peace with things.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.906
If you're serious about it,
you better get your butt in gear.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.908
Shift starts in about an hour.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.870
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>Archie knew for sure: he was angry.</i>

04:06.621 --> 04:08.331
<i>And hitting things made it better.</i>

04:13.169 --> 04:14.170
Meal break, boys.

04:17.131 --> 04:17.966
Andrews.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.260
This is a union crew.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.637
You need to take your mandatory break.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.013
Stop working.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.145
When I say stop, you stop.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.690
Back off. I don't need a break.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.400
You don't want to do this, kid. I got you by about 100 pounds.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.785
That's it.
I don't care if you are Fred's kid.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.829
-You're off my crew!
-The hell I am!

04:48.413 --> 04:50.832
<i>With Hiram laid up</i>
<i>in the hospital clinging to life,</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:53.876
<i>there was blood in the water,</i>
<i>and sharks were closing in</i>

04:53.960 --> 04:56.087
<i>on the mobster's daughter, Veronica Lodge.</i>

04:56.713 --> 04:57.922
From my family to yours.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.426
While I love a grand gesture, Elio,

05:02.385 --> 05:05.513
-diamonds are a girl's best friend.
-These are for your father.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.975
I heard he's still in the hospital,
and I wanted to come here personally

05:09.058 --> 05:13.187
-to tell you I'm praying he pulls through.
-Well, to paraphrase Samuel Clemens,

05:13.771 --> 05:16.524
reports of his death
have been greatly exaggerated.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.860
The vultures are circling, Veronica.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.070
They're eager to swoop in
on his territory.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.488
Talking about yourself?

05:22.572 --> 05:24.657
I'm offering some friendly advice.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.453
Jobs like the hit on your father,
it's very rare they go unfinished.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.914
<i>Yes, we all had our problems.</i>

05:32.081 --> 05:33.583
<i>The town was drowning in them.</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:36.294
<i>A good-looking one was about</i>
<i>to walk through my door.</i>

05:40.673 --> 05:42.383
Nice hat, Bacall.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.013
I've got a job for you, Jones.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.390
I want you...

05:50.475 --> 05:52.268
to find out who shot my father.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.148
You'll get the other half
when you give me their name.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.692
That is a big job.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.782
Half the people in this town wanna
see your old man kick the maple barrel.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.200
-No offense.
-None taken.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.077
I'll give you your first suspect.

06:12.288 --> 06:15.875
My mother. A few weeks ago,
I overheard my parents arguing.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.920
It was right before the quarantine,
after I had my seizure.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.797
No. I supported you.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.716
-You swore that this wouldn't happen.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.885
<i>My mother was berating my father.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:27.804
Something about breaking a promise.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.601
-I'm a big girl.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.811
I can take it.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.646
Well, then...

06:37.855 --> 06:40.108
Consider me your Philip Marlowe.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.694
<i>I didn't mind playing detective,</i>
<i>especially for this price.</i>

06:43.778 --> 06:47.281
<i>But if I'd known then and there</i>
<i>where this investigation would lead me,</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:49.867
<i>I never would've taken the money.</i>

06:56.624 --> 07:00.211
To what do I owe the pleasure?
-I'll just get right to it, Madam Mayor.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.384
-I love my husband.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.928
I hear not all is well at The Pembrooke.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.721
Records and witnesses will attest,

07:10.805 --> 07:13.141
I was on the phone with Hiram
when he was shot,

07:13.641 --> 07:15.518
picking up lunch at Pop's.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.479
What were you and Hiram arguing about
when Veronica had a seizure?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.481
Well, Mr. Jones, if you must know...

07:21.441 --> 07:23.860
we fought
because I caught Hiram having an affair.

07:24.485 --> 07:28.364
I had been suspicious for a while,
so, I had Sheriff Minetta follow him.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.451
This was before he was butchered,
of course.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.703
And he...

07:35.455 --> 07:36.456
gave me these.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.295
Now, I don't know who she is,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.173
but they met regularly
at the Five Seasons.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.633
But Hiram having another woman
is good motive to shoot him.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.926
No, it isn't.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.721
I simply asked him to end it, and he did.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.599
I'm telling you this
because I have nothing to hide.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.311
Keep those. I mean, who knows?

07:58.394 --> 08:01.272
Maybe Hiram's mistress was angry
when he called it quits.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.357
You do know how volatile blonds can be.

08:07.403 --> 08:11.532
No. You're not going to the job site today
after you picked a fight yesterday.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.203
I was trying to do my job.
It wasn't my fault. And then Vic--

08:15.286 --> 08:18.539
Vic? Vic who has worked for me
for a very a long time?

08:18.956 --> 08:21.167
-Fine. Whatever.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.461
No. We're not done here, young man.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.923
You wanna explain to me
how I found this in your bedroom?

08:27.006 --> 08:30.384
You think you're the first kid
to take a drink in high school? No.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.429
-This does not solve your problems.
-I'm out of here.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.389
Fine. Take a walk. Clear your head.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.559
While you're out there,
think about how you need to shape up!

08:41.604 --> 08:46.275
We are gathered today
to mourn the passing of one of our own.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.946
Betty.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.241
Sweet, darling Betty.
You've come to pay your respects.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.537
Well, Uncle Claudius was family, so...

08:57.620 --> 08:58.704
Mourn with us, cousin.

09:03.376 --> 09:09.006
Tragically, this ungrateful town never
welcomed Claudius to its bosom.

09:09.090 --> 09:13.094
And I believe that is why
he committed the most cardinal of sins...

09:14.554 --> 09:15.638
taking his own life.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.684
Crocodile tears.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.483
While I appreciate the company,

09:28.276 --> 09:30.611
tell me,
what are you really doing here, Betty,

09:30.987 --> 09:32.154
at our uncle's funeral?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.364
I came to talk to you.

09:34.323 --> 09:39.245
Cheryl, people connected to your mother
keep dying by poisoning,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.664
or by strange suicides,

09:41.747 --> 09:43.207
including your father.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.501
My father...

09:46.711 --> 09:49.380
hung himself in a barn, Betty.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.924
He slipped a rope around his neck

09:52.008 --> 09:54.427
and kicked a maple barrel out
from under him.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.470
End of story.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.306
Is everything okay?

09:58.889 --> 10:01.183
Betty was being a gnat,
as usual, Tee-Tee.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.270
-And I don't have any patience for it.
-Back off, Betty.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.314
It's been a rough day.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.819
Sweet Pea, Fangs.
Why bring me here? I'm on a case.

10:11.902 --> 10:15.448
I heard the Gargoyle Gang is riled up.
They're looking for Tall Boy.

10:15.531 --> 10:19.118
And as long as his body's down here,
it's a ticking time bomb.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.704
Yeah, well,
it's too hot to move him right now.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.663
Hey.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.583
Let's not lose our heads.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.377
Okay? Fangs,
I need you to stay here with Tall Boy.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.047
And I need you to lock this place up.
I'm serious.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.549
Sweet Pea,
you need to tail someone for me.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.181
<i>Nico, Leo.</i>

10:40.765 --> 10:41.807
We're in a crisis.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.394
The mob underworld smells blood,
and we need to change the narrative.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.522
Obscure the fact
that my father's down for the count,

10:48.606 --> 10:50.691
and present a strong front.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.401
-Too late.
-People are talking.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.780
No one's seen the Man in Black.
No one's collecting the vig.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.740
What

10:57.823 --> 11:00.159
We should get out there
and start collecting, immediately.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.286
Nico and I have been discussing options.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.040
It might be in your family's best interest
to align with the Grandes.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.792
You mean Elio's family?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.795
Not gonna happen.
-Your father took a bullet

11:10.878 --> 11:11.879
two inches from his heart.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.423
If we're not careful,
our next play could be our last.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.302
I don't need you to mob-splain
what's best for my family.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.055
Due respect, you're not being realistic.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.183
Due respect, you're fired.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.644
-Both of you.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.438
You're getting rid
of the only capos you have left?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.692
The same two clowns who didn't
protect my dad from getting shot?

11:32.983 --> 11:34.151
Yeah, no, we're good.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.784
I consider you both inner circle.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.953
Smithers, as my former doorman,

11:44.662 --> 11:47.873
and Reggie,
as my jacked jack of all trades,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.918
I asked you here
because I need people I can trust.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.214
Our enemies are sensing weakness,
and we need to show strength.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.590
Veronica, if I may...

11:56.882 --> 12:01.053
There was a moment, back in the trenches,
when our numbers were greatly diminished.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.558
We knew the enemy would storm
the barricade at any moment.

12:05.641 --> 12:09.311
I collected the helmets from our dead,
and propped them atop our bayonets.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.107
High enough so that they'd be visible
to our enemies and give them pause.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.025
See, sometimes,

12:15.609 --> 12:17.194
it's not what things are, it's what they appear to be.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.784
You've just given me an idea, Smithers.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.287
But we're gonna need
your bus driver's cap.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.836
So, who's this blond bombshell
that you're tracking?

12:34.211 --> 12:35.296
Hiram's mistress.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.174
He broke things off with her.
She may want revenge.

12:38.507 --> 12:42.595
Concierge tipped me off about the floor,
but I wish they'd given me a room number.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.264
Well, maybe there was no room number
to give.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.979
-Thanks for coming with me, by the way.
-My pleasure.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.733
My investigation is on hold
until I hear back from Dr. Curdle Junior.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.195
Turns out,
there was no autopsy on Claudius.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.406
Penelope had him cremated
before he could perform one.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.243
I'm hoping there's something
in Clifford Blossom's autopsy report.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.913
No one's home. Let's move on.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.290
Would Bogart move on?

13:11.582 --> 13:12.958
Let's just give it a try.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.629
What kind of hotel room is unlocked?

13:27.389 --> 13:32.353
And now apparently there's
a not-so-secret sex club in Riverdale.

13:41.904 --> 13:42.947
Excuse me. What is this place?

13:49.662 --> 13:50.663
The Maple Club.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.667
A safe place,
as long as you know the safe word.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.921
You seen this woman

14:00.089 --> 14:01.674
You just scared off my client.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.479
She doesn't work here,
but I see her around.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.023
Try Room 311.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.777
Laura, why did Mr. Arklight leave
in such a rush?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.072
Why are you two here?

14:25.656 --> 14:27.950
You know this is a private club. Get out.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.034
You mean a brothel?

14:30.160 --> 14:34.206
By the way, does the new sheriff know
there's a red light district in Riverdale?

14:36.750 --> 14:40.087
My time is costly, children,
so, what do you want?

14:40.713 --> 14:45.259
I knew you were an escort, Auntie,
but now you're exploiting other women?

14:46.969 --> 14:49.471
These women aren't victims, Betty.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.475
At The Maple Club,
it is the men who suffer.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.020
We specialize in domination.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.731
These ladies make enough
to start new lives.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.567
Oh, please. You are only helping yourself.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.818
And why shouldn't I?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.279
No one else ever has.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.780
When I was eight years old,

15:06.864 --> 15:08.866
<i>I was plucked</i>
<i>from the Sisters of Quiet Mercy</i>

15:08.949 --> 15:10.075
<i>by the Blossom family.</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:13.162
You poisoned the Sisters
because they sold you to the Blossoms?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.289
I didn't kill those nuns. And, anyway...

15:16.290 --> 15:18.751
it was the so-called monsignor
who sold me,

15:18.834 --> 15:20.294
-not the Sisters.
Fine.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.421
You didn't kill the fake nuns.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.631
Did you kill Claudius?

15:23.714 --> 15:27.885
-He committed suicide, so I was told.

15:27.968 --> 15:31.639
Either way, I was right here
when the poor man died.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.682
Ask any of my girls.

15:34.683 --> 15:38.145
<i>Fun fact of the day:</i>
<i>Penelope is the madam of a kink club.</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:40.356
Okay, her sob story
doesn't change the fact

15:40.439 --> 15:42.149
that she's a stone-cold murderer.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.778
Wanna check out Room 311?
I could use one of your bobby pins.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.742
It's Curdle. Maybe he tracked down
Clifford's autopsy report.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.203
And just like that,
you are back on the case.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.373
-No rest for the wicked.
-Not in a wicked town.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.459
See you later.

16:10.636 --> 16:16.183
♪ <i>Sooner or later</i>
<i>You're gonna be mine ♪</i>

16:35.327 --> 16:36.870
I'm a paying customer, Reggie.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.166
-I'll leave when I'm ready to leave.
-Veronica's dealing with enough crap.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.669
She doesn't need you making a scene.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.588
Can I get another bartender
in here, please?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.924
Don't touch me.
-Let's go.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.677
-Hey, Toby. Toby.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.637
It's okay. I know him.

16:54.763 --> 16:55.597
He's our friend.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.933
It's okay. I'll go.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.853
-I'll go.
I got him.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.229
I got him. It's fine.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.691
<i> </i>God.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.652
Josie.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.572
You can't tell Veronica about this.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.867
Listen up, Andrews.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.120
You are in free fall,
and I am not having it.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.331
It's time for a literal, and metaphoric,

17:21.415 --> 17:22.416
cold shower.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.752
Wait. Wait, Josie, don't--

17:29.298 --> 17:31.133
<i>At the docks,</i>
<i>it was a classic con:</i>

17:31.550 --> 17:34.803
-<i>Smoke and mirrors with a pretty girl.</i>
-Collecting for Lodge.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.308
-No longer in our employ.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.768
I'm Veronica.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.063
I'm sure you know my father, Hiram Lodge.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.986
He doesn't like to be kept waiting,
and neither do I.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.242
See you next week.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.999
Well played, Ms. Veronica.

18:04.833 --> 18:05.834
Thank you, Smithers.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.128
And you, too, Man in Black.

18:09.755 --> 18:14.343
Apologies for the delay, Ms. Cooper,
but this one took some digging.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.638
Clifford Blossom's wife requested
that there be no autopsy.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.724
But my father was nothing
if not a curious man.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.936
So, let me guess.
He performed one anyways?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.981
What does it say?
That he died of asphyxiation by hanging?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.442
There was bruising around the esophagus,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.277
consistent with a hanging.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.196
-Hmm.
-However...

18:35.030 --> 18:38.033
there was also tetrodotoxin
in his bloodstream.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.159
Puffer fish venom.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.996
In Clifford's case,
the dose was almost certainly fatal.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.291
So, you're saying Clifford
may not have died from hanging,

18:47.376 --> 18:50.003
-but from being poisoned.
-I'm saying that

18:50.420 --> 18:53.423
Clifford Blossom was already dead
when he hung himself.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.760
<i>And Betty Cooper thought, "Gotcha."</i>

19:01.974 --> 19:03.016
What's this?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.227
Um, lemon, ginger, and cayenne.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.234
Where is your dad?

19:12.526 --> 19:13.569
He's at work.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.948
I got canned on my first day,
so, I went to drown my sorrows.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.659
Look, Archie.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.121
I know we didn't talk much last year,

19:24.204 --> 19:28.333
and I can't even attempt to guess
at the hell that you've been through.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.795
And maybe all you can do now
is wallow in booze,

19:31.879 --> 19:32.921
and pick fights.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.967
But personally, I think you need
to channel your anger

19:37.050 --> 19:38.760
into something constructive,

19:38.844 --> 19:41.430
like music, maybe.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.807
-Josie--
-Or...

19:44.725 --> 19:46.935
if you're in the mood to hit things...

19:48.312 --> 19:49.813
Kevin's dad boxes at the gym.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.151
Either way, you've gotta deal
with your demons head-on.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.738
I thought I did.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.699
<i>In the cabin, I thought I faced my demons.</i>

20:01.617 --> 20:02.868
And killed them.

20:07.122 --> 20:07.956
And myself.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.250
You're losing me.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.543
You're right, Josie.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.087
I gotta face this head-on.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.716
And there's one person
I still haven't seen

20:17.799 --> 20:19.259
since I've been back in Riverdale.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.094
Archie, where are you going?

20:21.803 --> 20:25.307
I'm going to face,
and kill, one last demon.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.103
<i>That's one thing</i>
<i>about being a crime boss:</i>

20:30.479 --> 20:32.439
<i>You learn to never leave a paper trail.</i>

20:33.232 --> 20:36.985
<i>But Hermione Lodge,</i>
<i>it seems, was out of practice.</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:39.571
What the hell is this, Mom?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.241
I was entering today's take
into Daddy's ledger

20:42.324 --> 20:45.535
when I noticed a shady collection
of invoices and receipts.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.579
So, I dug a little deeper.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.333
And Daddy's Fizzle Rocks empire?

20:52.918 --> 20:54.253
You're a part of it, Mom.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.088
No.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.591
You ordered the quarantine.
You paid these invoices.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.803
-It's your name in blood-red ink.
-No, Veronica.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.724
I found out that your father
and Claudius were making drugs

21:07.808 --> 21:10.978
in the new prison,
and at the Blossom Maple Factory,

21:11.061 --> 21:13.397
so, I told him to shut it down.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.024
I even helped him create a distraction,

21:16.483 --> 21:18.485
so he could do it quickly and cleanly.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.695
The quarantine.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.988
It was a smoke screen.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.449
But then, typical of your father,
he lied to me.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.201
Instead of shutting it down,

21:26.285 --> 21:29.329
he consolidated everything
into the prison.<i> </i>Believe me.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.623
Veronica, I want no part of this.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.668
We agree, then.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.379
Let's end this nightmare.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.881
Destroy the drugs,
and the means of production.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.133
Burn it to the ground.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.843
While Daddy can't lift a finger
to stop us.

21:42.926 --> 21:45.554
Now, that is one option, yes.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.140
Or we could sell it.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.851
I already have a buyer lined up.

21:50.976 --> 21:51.977
All-cash offer.

21:52.060 --> 21:55.188
He's willing to take the drugs,
the lab, everything.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.736
Shouldn't we get something in return
for all the pain he has caused us?

22:02.863 --> 22:05.365
It's over, Auntie Blossom.

22:05.907 --> 22:06.950
I know what you did.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.827
I know what happened in the barn.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.955
How you faked Clifford's hanging
and lied to the police.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.334
And who is your witness

22:16.793 --> 22:20.255
Proof that you poisoned Clifford
with puffer fish venom.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.465
You'll go to jail for this.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.801
Won't be justice for everyone you killed,
but it's a good start.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.639
You think you know what I've done,

22:30.140 --> 22:32.684
but have you paused to consider why?

22:34.394 --> 22:37.606
Because you're a serial killer,
a black widow.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.067
The Red Dahlia, let's call you.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.985
You poison people.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.196
Not people, Betty.

22:45.989 --> 22:46.823
Men.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.370
I'm not admitting anything,
but they are the true poison.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.246
Clifford killed my son.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.082
Daryl was a Judas.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.416
And Claudius...

22:56.958 --> 22:59.211
I'm surprised
you're not thanking me for that.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.837
Why would I thank you?

23:00.921 --> 23:02.631
Because he caused your seizure.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.008
He caused everyone's seizures.

23:05.467 --> 23:08.553
Claudius was running
a Fizzle Rocks operation

23:08.637 --> 23:11.014
from our once-distinguished maple factory,

23:11.098 --> 23:14.267
and dumping the runoff
into Sweetwater River.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.854
-No, Betty.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.565
The runoff from the manufacturing
of the drug.

23:20.649 --> 23:21.650
Not the drug itself.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.819
But why did it only affect girls?

23:25.362 --> 23:29.157
I am an herbalist, Betty,
not a medical doctor.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.203
Tests on Sweetwater Reservoir
were ordered and faked.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.581
But Claudius had every intention

23:36.665 --> 23:39.709
of continuing
to poison the town with drugs,

23:40.252 --> 23:43.463
so, it was fitting that poison be his end.

23:43.547 --> 23:48.593
Just because someone is a horrible person
doesn't give you the right to kill them.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.845
Doesn't it?

23:50.095 --> 23:53.306
Isn't that what you did
with the poison that infected your home?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.641
The imposter Chic?

23:56.351 --> 23:57.686
Hal tells me things, too.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.605
<i>When you delivered Chic to the Black Hood,</i>

24:00.689 --> 24:02.232
you sent him to his death.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.443
You're not so innocent, Betty.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.320
And if you insist on turning me in,

24:08.572 --> 24:10.699
I will gladly do the same to you.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.327
<i>And that is when Betty realized:</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:17.164
<i>No one's innocent in Crime Town.</i>

24:18.290 --> 24:21.209
<i>Certainly not</i>
<i>Hiram Lodge's mystery mistress.</i>

24:33.305 --> 24:35.098
What are you doing in my room?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.101
That's a good question.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.353
Here's another one.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.190
Why's a water inspector got a gun?

24:44.649 --> 24:46.151
I only wanna talk, Ms. Mulwray.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.487
Who the hell are you?
How do you know my name?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.447
It's the Glamourge Egg, right?

24:51.281 --> 24:53.074
You shoot me, I'll drop it.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.246
I've seen one of these before.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.666
Hiram gives them as gifts.
Maybe in your case, payment.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.294
And it costs more
than you'll make in a lifetime.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.214
So, put it down before you break it.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.635
Based on the things I found in your room,
here's what I know about you.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.095
You're a health and sanitation inspector.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.265
Must pay quite a bit
if you can afford the Five Seasons.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.727
-Unless Hiram put you up.
-But I'm no kept woman.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.730
I do a job, I get paid for it.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.526
Report says you were sent
to investigate Riverdale's water supply.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.529
Specifically,
Sweetwater River and Reservoir. Why?

25:31.363 --> 25:34.199
Young women in town were having seizures.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.534
I was sent in to help.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.077
Brought in by Hiram Lodge.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.663
He also make you write to Governor Dooley,

25:40.121 --> 25:42.457
advising him
to support a town

25:42.999 --> 25:44.125
You see, I'm confused,

25:44.209 --> 25:47.921
because the letter says the water's dirty,
but the report says it's clean,

25:48.004 --> 25:50.590
you either lied to the governor
or faked that report.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.927
-Or both.

25:55.345 --> 25:58.390
Break the egg if you want. I don't care.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.810
Just get out of my room
before I call hotel security.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.236
<i>Why was Hiram faking</i>
<i>water test reports</i>

26:11.319 --> 26:13.530
<i>What did any of this have to do</i>
<i>with who shot him?</i>

26:15.615 --> 26:16.449
Yeah.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.287
<i>I followed Hermione Lodge</i>
<i>like you asked. You better get out here.</i>

26:21.830 --> 26:23.498
Stay down, and keep quiet.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.214
Is that...? It can't be.

26:35.510 --> 26:36.720
Sheriff Minetta's alive?

26:37.554 --> 26:40.432
-Thought he was decapitated.
-Nope. From the sounds of it,

26:40.515 --> 26:42.976
he and Hermione
have been having an affair for months.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.979
-Wait, listen.
-There's too many people asking questions.

26:46.896 --> 26:49.149
Which means,
our little outstanding problem,

26:49.983 --> 26:52.277
you need to take care of tonight.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.112
Now clear the decks.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.282
Use your old sheriff's gun.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.493
Then all signs will point to FP.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.871
-They're talking about framing my dad.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.707
I have to figure it out and warn him.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.899
<i> Back in an eerily deserted</i>
<i>Riverdale General,</i>

27:30.982 --> 27:33.151
<i>Archie Andrews was a man on a mission.</i>

27:33.610 --> 27:35.945
<i>On a collision course</i>
<i>with his dark destiny.</i>

27:40.367 --> 27:43.286
<i>After months of torment</i>
<i>at the hands of the Man in Black...</i>

27:46.456 --> 27:49.626
<i>he was trying to bring a sorry chapter</i>
<i>in his life to a close...</i>

27:50.627 --> 27:52.170
<i>the only way he knew how.</i>

28:01.846 --> 28:04.766
-I need to talk to you.
-There's something at the hospital.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.935
No. You can't go there.<i> </i>It's a setup.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.480
Hermione and Minetta-- He's alive.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.108
They plotted together to kill Hiram Lodge.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.192
-Yes.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.986
They're going to finish the job tonight
and pin it on you.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.197
-Dad, there is a lot you need to know.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.949
I just got back from the coroner's office.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.911
A week ago, the torso
of a Michael Minetta was found

28:24.994 --> 28:26.287
without its head and hands.

28:26.996 --> 28:29.666
But it wasn't Sheriff Minetta,
because I just saw him.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.168
-He's very much alive.
-Oh, my.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.088
-Someone must've made a grave mistake--
-Save it, Junior.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.006
Who asked you to fake Minetta's death?

28:39.843 --> 28:41.052
Hermione Lodge.

28:41.302 --> 28:45.098
I saw Minetta and Hermione,
up at some secret love shack up north.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.309
I heard them talking about setting you up.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.230
She'll try to put Hiram's shooting on you.
You need to arrest them.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.314
I can't do that.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.526
Yeah, you can. You're the sheriff.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.404
They've been trying to murder Hiram Lodge.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.321
No.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.032
No, they didn't.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.619
I shot Hiram.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.913
-Hermione came to me.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.749
She wanted it done. And I...

29:12.250 --> 29:13.293
I wanted revenge.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.754
You think I forgot about Riot Night?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.466
That son of a bitch came close
to getting you killed.

29:19.549 --> 29:23.636
I've been biding my time,
waiting for the perfect opportunity.

29:24.387 --> 29:27.891
If you and Hermione tried to kill Hiram,
why'd she appoint you sheriff?

29:28.892 --> 29:30.268
Payment. It was my payment.

29:30.935 --> 29:34.355
I was naive enough to think
the office of the sheriff would protect me

29:34.439 --> 29:36.149
if Hermione got an itch
to double-cross me.

29:36.524 --> 29:37.650
Guess I was wrong.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.197
Guess it's lucky
that you have me in your corner.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.700
I have a confession to make.

29:46.951 --> 29:47.911
About Tall Boy.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.956
There's a way
that I can solve both of our problems.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.167
But we'll need Ms. Cooper's help.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.213
I came here to end our story.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.965
When we first met, I was a scared kid,

30:01.341 --> 30:03.927
afraid that I could lose everything.

30:04.677 --> 30:08.223
You took me under your wing,
taught me to use fear as a weapon.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.433
And for a while, it worked.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.560
But it also hurt people.

30:12.977 --> 30:17.106
Of all the horrible things you've done,
you know what enrages me the most?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.984
That after my father was shot
by the Black Hood,

30:20.527 --> 30:22.403
and almost died in my arms,

30:22.987 --> 30:24.656
you hired some stooge...

30:25.532 --> 30:27.742
to take another shot at him, in our house.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.666
Maybe it's time I balance the scales.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.676
A shot for a shot.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.552
FP. Alice.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.304
-Hermione.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.514
Perfect timing. We'll start the interview.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.892
All right, FP, let's check the levels.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.144
-Yeah.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.147
Well, Madam Mayor,
I am pleased to announce

31:39.230 --> 31:41.566
that we caught the man
who shot your husband.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.321
-Mm-hm.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.990
-Gerald Petite.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.743
But you might know him as Tall Boy.

31:51.993 --> 31:55.330
It seems that Hiram kept him alive
in a secret cabin in the north,

31:55.413 --> 31:56.414
to carry out...

31:56.998 --> 31:58.333
odd jobs for him.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.337
Can you imagine that?

32:03.546 --> 32:05.757
Tall Boy resisted arrest, got violent,

32:05.840 --> 32:09.052
and unfortunately,
I was forced to discharge my sidearm.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.597
He died on the way to the hospital.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.310
-Well, thank goodness it's over.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.145
And so neatly, too.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.066
You know,
I would love to interview you next.

32:23.149 --> 32:27.320
Get your perspective as mayor,
and wife of the victim, of course.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.489
That's a great idea, Alice.

32:29.822 --> 32:33.242
It's important that the mayor and I both
go on the record about what happened.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.786
Present a united front.

32:35.578 --> 32:38.873
Don't you agree, Madam Mayor?
That we should be on the same page?

32:39.624 --> 32:40.458
Yes.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.169
I think we are.

32:44.212 --> 32:47.215
I think my mom may have hired someone
to shoot my father,

32:47.298 --> 32:50.677
so that she could make a profit
from the sale of his drug operation.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.345
-Damn.
-I know.

32:52.428 --> 32:53.972
So, we need to act fast.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.349
Tonight we're gonna break into the prison,

32:56.432 --> 32:57.392
find the drugs,

32:57.475 --> 33:01.270
and destroy them, and the equipment,
before my mom sells everything.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.773
Sounds a lot like the plot of <i>Bad Boys II.</i>

33:05.149 --> 33:06.234
I'm in, Ronnie.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.861
But why? If she's selling it--

33:08.945 --> 33:11.698
I'll be damned
if my mom gets a payout for her crimes.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.288
Archie

33:24.210 --> 33:26.212
-I gotta go.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.505
It's not what you think.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.800
But can you handle our heist
on your own, Bad Boy?

33:31.342 --> 33:32.176
Yeah.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.196
-Alive, thanks to you.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.033
But, Archie, what were you doing here?

33:56.617 --> 33:57.660
I...

33:58.953 --> 34:00.038
came looking for you.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.376
Reggie may have told you
what happened at the speakeasy,

34:05.460 --> 34:06.961
how I was acting like an ass.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.964
I wanted to apologize. I wasn't myself.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.010
-I haven't been for a while.
-I'm sorry, too.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.264
That I ever thought for a second
that you shot him.

34:19.557 --> 34:21.350
At some point, maybe I could have.

34:22.602 --> 34:24.562
But I don't hate him anymore, Veronica.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.109
He's awake.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.320
And he wants see you.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.117
And, Archie...

34:39.619 --> 34:41.579
If you ever need a friend to talk to...

34:55.426 --> 34:56.385
Archie Andrews.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.932
Veronica told me what happened.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.602
How I have you to thank for being alive.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.613
We've been locked in battle for some time.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.117
I never set out to be your enemy,
Mr. Lodge.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.870
All I want is
to live in Riverdale in peace.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.665
Well...

35:26.249 --> 35:28.292
I see no reason for us to keep fighting.

35:29.585 --> 35:30.419
So,

35:30.503 --> 35:31.838
starting tonight...

35:33.172 --> 35:34.423
I propose a truce.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.594
You don't make a move against me,
and I won't make a move against you.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.847
A life for a life.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.656
-I don't know.

35:59.699 --> 36:00.700
Maybe the truth.

36:02.910 --> 36:03.995
But probably not.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.465
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in case you'd forgotten,</i>

36:16.549 --> 36:19.010
<i>Betty's encounter with Penelope</i>
<i>had shaken her worldview.</i>

36:19.093 --> 36:21.637
<i>There was only one person</i>
<i>she could talk to about it.</i>

36:21.721 --> 36:25.099
Penelope's guilty.
I found proof that she poisoned Clifford.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.601
My clever daughter.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.978
What do you plan to do next?

36:29.061 --> 36:30.188
I'm not sure.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.442
I thought if I caught her,
I'd turn her in.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.152
But hearing her talk,

36:36.235 --> 36:38.905
seeing how she's living her life,

36:38.988 --> 36:40.698
how she's been twisted...

36:40.781 --> 36:42.950
I don't know, I feel almost feel...

36:43.034 --> 36:44.327
Pity for her?

36:44.785 --> 36:45.870
Penelope and I,

36:45.953 --> 36:48.456
we're products of our environment,
raised by those

36:48.539 --> 36:51.500
who taught us a twisted sense
of right from wrong.

36:51.584 --> 36:55.421
Do you still believe that she's a monster
who deserves to be in here?

36:55.504 --> 36:58.049
Maybe not every murderer is guilty.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.886
And maybe not every victim is innocent.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.846
Maybe it's not all black and white.

37:04.222 --> 37:08.809
I wonder, Betty, if one day,
you'll ever be able to see me

37:09.268 --> 37:11.812
in that same compassionate light.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.485
Oh.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.988
Well, how you feeling, Red?

37:21.072 --> 37:23.074
Better.
-Good.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.993
Thank you for taking care of me.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.495
Setting me straight.

37:28.287 --> 37:30.539
Sometimes we all need a little tough love.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.335
I was thinking about your advice, too.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.254
Doing something constructive.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.382
-For sure he will.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.968
And, uh, I was thinking,

37:42.051 --> 37:43.427
maybe we could...

37:43.761 --> 37:46.264
I don't know,
if you wanted to jam sometime, or...?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.934
-Yeah.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.479
Yeah, sure.

37:54.105 --> 37:54.939
Let's do it.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.024
But you're singing backup.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.360
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.782
What the hell did you do?

38:04.865 --> 38:07.076
I assume you're talking about the drugs.

38:07.868 --> 38:10.621
Reggie and I burned them last night,
with the equipment.

38:10.705 --> 38:14.083
But I told you I had a buyer lined up.
They paid in advance.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.585
So, I saved you
from being a drug dealer, Mom.

38:17.336 --> 38:20.339
-I can't, Veronica.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.259
I used the cash
to pay off Governor Dooley.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.011
To keep our names clean.

38:25.094 --> 38:28.222
And now my buyer is coming,
and they are gonna want blood.

38:29.348 --> 38:32.727
-You have no idea what you've just done.
-I know exactly what I did.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.438
And I know what you did, Mom. And I'm not the only one on your case.

38:42.361 --> 38:44.739
You think you're really smart, don't you?

38:45.740 --> 38:46.991
You have all the answers.

38:47.074 --> 38:49.785
I know Hiram's mistress works
for the Sanitation Department

38:49.869 --> 38:52.621
and doctored false water reports
for your husband.

38:52.705 --> 38:53.873
I see.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.125
Is that all?

38:56.208 --> 38:57.084
No.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.837
Not in the slightest.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.089
Betty told me about the runoff

39:02.173 --> 39:04.633
from the Fizzle Rocks manufactured
at the factory.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.471
How it poisoned Sweetwater River,
gave everyone seizures.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.223
That's why Hiram had
to doctor those reports.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.308
To cover his ass.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.894
It's also why he moved his drug lab
to the prison.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.188
Away from the water supply.

39:17.271 --> 39:21.275
Now, my guess is
that you were pissed about his drug lab

39:21.567 --> 39:24.070
and what it was doing
to all the girls in the town.

39:24.612 --> 39:28.699
Soon after, you hired my father
to shoot Hiram Lodge.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.326
When that didn't work,

39:30.409 --> 39:32.578
you tried to finish the job
in the hospital with Minetta

39:32.661 --> 39:37.166
and a sheriff-issued pistol
so that you could pin it all on my dad.

39:37.249 --> 39:39.710
Oh, and I also know why you did it.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.295
Veronica.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.423
You knew Hiram was responsible
for her seizure.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.133
Very good, Mr. Jones.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.386
But you forgot one thing.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.765
Last year, Hiram hired Tall Boy

39:52.848 --> 39:55.226
to take shots at me
during the mayoral debate,

39:55.726 --> 39:56.936
nearly killing me.

39:57.019 --> 39:59.563
So, that's what this was about

40:00.356 --> 40:04.151
So that you could run off with Minetta?
Live a happy little life together?

40:05.027 --> 40:07.405
You can't tell anyone about this.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.615
Not Veronica, no one.

40:09.698 --> 40:10.950
Because if I go down...

40:12.368 --> 40:13.494
your father goes down.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.162
And that's a promise.

40:15.788 --> 40:16.997
So, I think...

40:18.624 --> 40:19.667
we should agree...

40:21.168 --> 40:22.628
to keep each other's secrets.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.047
Don't you think?

40:30.177 --> 40:32.388
<i>So,</i>
<i>Hermione and I were deadlocked.</i>

40:32.847 --> 40:33.681
<i>In a stalemate.</i>

40:34.223 --> 40:35.599
<i>Much like Hiram and Archie.</i>

40:36.350 --> 40:37.685
<i>And Betty and Penelope.</i>

40:38.894 --> 40:39.895
<i>As for Minetta?</i>

40:40.855 --> 40:43.274
<i>I didn't imagine there was much</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

40:43.357 --> 40:44.942
Grab me a cigarette, will you?

40:45.943 --> 40:47.027
Of course, Michael.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.991
We gotta talk about what to do
with FP and his kid.

40:52.908 --> 40:55.870
Your husband always had a simple way
of tying up loose ends.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.331
He did, didn't he?

41:06.547 --> 41:09.425
<i>Perhaps, in Riverdale,</i>
<i>the best you could hope for wasn't to win,</i>

41:09.508 --> 41:12.178
<i>but to draw, and pray not to lose.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:14.763
Working late, I see.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.935
I assume you're here to find out whodunit.

41:20.019 --> 41:23.272
After my father woke up,
it was the first thing he asked me.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.817
-I told him it was Tall Boy.

41:26.901 --> 41:27.735
I think so.

41:29.528 --> 41:32.448
If it's good enough for my father,
it's good enough for me.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.869
Second half of your payment.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.461
You don't wanna know who really did it?

41:50.508 --> 41:51.759
Forget it, Jughead.
