00:14.633 --> 00:17.667
(Meredith) MY MOTHER
USED TO SAY THAT FOR A SURGEON,

00:17.700 --> 00:20.167
A DAY WITHOUT DEATH
IS A RARE GIFT.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.067
***

00:23.100 --> 00:26.100
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

00:27.667 --> 00:31.533
TIME OF DEATH--11:53.

00:31.567 --> 00:33.833
***

00:33.867 --> 00:35.767
EVERY DAY WE FACE DEATH.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.633
EVERY DAY WE LOSE LIFE.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.367
***

00:40.400 --> 00:42.300
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

00:42.333 --> 00:45.600
TIME OF DEATH--18:36.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.500
TIME OF DEATH--15:52.

00:49.533 --> 00:52.767
***

00:52.800 --> 00:56.467
AND EVERY DAY WE'RE HOPING
FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.200
***

00:59.233 --> 01:01.767
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT IT?

01:01.800 --> 01:06.200
UH, WE WERE AT HOME.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.700
YOU WERE THERE?

01:07.733 --> 01:10.400
YES, I WAS THERE.

01:10.433 --> 01:14.067
***

01:14.067 --> 01:17.167
IT'S OKAY
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.700
***

01:19.733 --> 01:22.233
DR. WYATT,
MY MOTHER TOOK A SCALPEL

01:22.267 --> 01:24.733
AND SLICED HER WRISTS
IN FRONT OF ME...

01:24.767 --> 01:27.633
AND I SAT ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
IN A POOL OF HER BLOOD,

01:27.667 --> 01:31.100
WAITING UNTIL SHE PASSED OUT
SO I COULD CALL 9-1-1.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.567
IT'S NOT OKAY
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.500
***

01:35.533 --> 01:38.367
WHY DID YOU WAIT
UNTIL SHE PASSED OUT?

01:38.400 --> 01:41.700
SHE ASKED ME NOT TO
BEFORE SHE SLIT HER WRISTS,

01:41.733 --> 01:43.633
SO I KNEW
I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE

01:43.667 --> 01:46.333
IF I TRIED
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.100
BUT YOU DID SAVE HER LIFE.

01:49.133 --> 01:51.367
SHE DIDN'T WANT IT SAVED.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.300
***

01:53.333 --> 01:55.800
YOU MUST BE VERY ANGRY
AT HER.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.833
NO.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.767
NOT AT HER.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.300
WHO ARE YOU ANGRY AT?

02:03.333 --> 02:06.700
WE'RE ATTACHED TO DEATH...

02:06.733 --> 02:08.833
CHAINED...

02:08.867 --> 02:12.433
LIKE PRISONERS...

02:12.467 --> 02:15.167
CAPTIVES.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.100
***

02:17.133 --> 02:19.267
DO YOU WANT
TO DANCE IT OUT?

02:19.300 --> 02:20.667
NO.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.533
DO YOU WANT
TO DRINK TEQUILA?

02:22.567 --> 02:23.600
NO.

02:23.633 --> 02:27.600
DO YOU WANT TO CALL ME NAMES,
MOCK ME ENDLESSLY?

02:27.633 --> 02:28.733
NO.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.367
I'M TRYING TO CHEER YOU UP.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.300
YEAH? WELL, STOP IT.
IT'S ANNOYING.

02:33.333 --> 02:36.433
AND IT'S NOT WORKING. I'M DEEP
IN THE WILDERNESS HERE.

02:36.467 --> 02:38.167
(sighs)

02:39.767 --> 02:43.067
DO YOU WANT
THE SPARKLE PAGER?

02:43.100 --> 02:45.200
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
YOU'RE SAD. ACTUALLY SAD.

02:45.233 --> 02:48.067
DO YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

02:48.100 --> 02:50.067
TO GIVE YOU
THE SPARKLE PAGER?

02:50.100 --> 02:53.733
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO SAD, YOU'RE
NOT EVEN ASKING ME FOR IT.

02:53.767 --> 02:55.567
I'M GIVING IT TO YOU.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.233
SHINY, SHINY PAGER WITH LOTS
OF SHINY, SHINY SURGERIES.

02:58.267 --> 03:00.333
IF I WERE THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO KISSED PEOPLE,

03:00.367 --> 03:03.200
I WOULD KISS YOU.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.100
***

03:09.133 --> 03:11.067
I TRIED TO CHANGE...

03:11.100 --> 03:12.700
TURN OVER A NEW LEAF.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.633
BUT THE LEAF ISN'T TURNING.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.233
YOU WEREN'T READY TO CHANGE.
AND THAT'S OKAY.

03:18.267 --> 03:21.533
ADELE WANTED ME TO CHANGE,
TO RETIRE.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.200
WELL, I'M STILL THE CHIEF,
AND THIS WEEKEND,

03:24.233 --> 03:26.167
I'M MOVING BACK HOME.
DOES ADELE KNOW THAT?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.367
SHE'LL BE FINE.
SHE WAS WRONG. I WAS RIGHT.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.067
AND NOW WE'RE--

03:30.067 --> 03:31.267
DOING IT LIKE BUNNIES.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.767
I CAN'T CHANGE.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.833
I CAN'T CHANGE.
I CAN'T CHANGE.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.733
BE WHO YOU ARE.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.633
I AM WHO I AM.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.600
A MAN.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.233
A MAN.

03:42.267 --> 03:43.600
***

03:43.633 --> 03:47.267
I HAVE A WAY ABOUT ME.
I'M A MAN WHO IS WHO HE IS.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.200
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE THAT MAN.

03:49.233 --> 03:52.100
(clicks tongue) I'M NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING. NOPE, NO JUDGMENT.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.600
(clears throat) BUT THE MAN
YOU ARE SLEPT WITH MY WIFE.

03:54.633 --> 03:57.500
AND YOU. YOU'VE BEEN
ON MY LAND FOR SIX MONTHS.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.333
BUT I GOT NO JUDGMENT.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.433
(sighs) I'M GONNA MISS
LIVING ON THE LAND.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.433
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL
PIECE OF LAND.

04:03.467 --> 04:04.733
WANNA BUY IT?

04:04.767 --> 04:06.667
YOU CAN'T SELL
THIS LAND.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.333
YOU HAVE BLUEPRINTS.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.167
THIS IS
YOUR LIVING ROOM WINDOW.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.333
THE HOUSE
THAT DEREK BUILT.
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S OVER.

04:12.367 --> 04:14.267
I'M THINKING ABOUT
GETTING A PLACE IN TOWN.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.200
BUT YOU LOVE THIS LAND.
THIS LAND AND FERRY BOATS
ARE WHO YOU ARE.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.567
A MAN CAN CHANGE.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.800
I'M SELLING THE LAND.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.733
AND FERRY BOATS...

04:23.767 --> 04:25.700
CRASH.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.567
***

04:39.667 --> 04:40.733
MORNING.

04:40.767 --> 04:41.833
HEY.

04:41.867 --> 04:45.400
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

04:45.433 --> 04:47.767
COME ON.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.667
(normal voice) HEY, CAN YOU
TAKE MY CASES THIS MORNING?

04:50.700 --> 04:53.467
CHECK IN ON MY POST-OPS?
YOU'RE NOT COMING TO WORK?

04:53.500 --> 04:55.333
NAH, I'M GONNA HANG
WITH REBECCA, WATCH MOVIES.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.367
SO IF YOU COULD
COVER FOR ME...

04:57.400 --> 05:00.267
HEY, TAKE A BITE.
YEAH, I'LL COVER FOR YOU.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.067
UM, ALEX... (whispers)
SHE'S NOT LOOKING VERY GOOD.

05:04.067 --> 05:06.833
SHE'S FINE.

05:06.867 --> 05:08.800
(Alex)
COME ON. TAKE A BITE.

05:13.867 --> 05:16.467
DR. BAILEY, I GOT
AN ANSWER FOR YOU

05:16.500 --> 05:18.400
FROM THE CHIEF
ABOUT YOUR SCHEDULE.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.667
HE SAID YOU'RE NOT SPENDING
ENOUGH HOURS IN THE O.R.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.600
BETWEEN THE CLINIC
AND YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT WORK.

05:22.633 --> 05:25.267
NOW I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY,
BUT I TOOK A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

05:25.300 --> 05:27.333
AND I CHECKED WITH
THE ATTENDINGS

05:27.367 --> 05:29.800
AND I NAILED THE CHIEF DOWN
TO A HARD COUNT.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.467
YOU NEED TO SPEND AT LEAST
15 TO 20 MORE HOURS

05:32.500 --> 05:34.733
PER WEEK IN SURGERY IN ORDER
TO SIT FOR YOUR BOARDS.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.533
SHOULD I TELL THE CHIEF
THAT'S POSSIBLE?

05:37.567 --> 05:40.333
JUST TRYING TO USE MY POWER
AS THE CHIEF'S INTERN FOR GOOD.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.500
SO... DR. BAILEY?
HUSH. I'M TRYING
TO SEE SOMETHING.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.433
WHEN I'M TRYING
TO SEE SOMETHING,

05:44.467 --> 05:47.067
I CAN'T DO IT IF YOU'RE
ASKING ME QUESTIONS.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.167
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SEE?

05:49.200 --> 05:52.600
DR. BAILEY, LISTEN, I AM
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT AVA.

05:52.633 --> 05:55.567
I MEAN REBECCA. I MEAN ALEX.
WELL, ALEX AND REBECCA...

05:55.600 --> 05:57.600
WHO USED TO BE CALLED AVA,
SO THAT'S WHY I KEEP--

05:57.633 --> 06:00.600
ANYWAY, LISTEN, SHE'S CRAZY,
AND I DON'T MEAN FUNNY CRAZY.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.533
OKAY? I MEAN BAD CRAZY.
OKAY?

06:02.567 --> 06:04.733
ALEX IS HOME WITH HER
RIGHT NOW, AND HE'S ALL,

06:04.767 --> 06:06.567
"TAKE A BITE,
TAKE A BITE."

06:06.600 --> 06:09.500
IT'S WEIRD AND SAD
AND... (sighs) I WANT TO HELP,

06:09.533 --> 06:11.433
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.467
SO I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.400
WHAT DO I DO?
SHE'S TRYING TO SEE SOMETHING.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.067
WHEN SHE'S TRYING
TO SEE SOMETHING,

06:17.100 --> 06:18.833
SHE DOESN'T NEED YOU
IN HER FACE ASKING QUESTIONS.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.733
YOU DON'T SEE ME
ASKING HER QUESTIONS.

06:20.767 --> 06:23.067
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SEE?
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.733
HUH.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.267
***

06:27.300 --> 06:29.767
(panting and moaning)

06:29.800 --> 06:32.300
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
AND ERICA...

06:32.333 --> 06:34.233
AND WE'RE GRABBING YOU,

06:34.267 --> 06:36.133
RIPPING OFF YOUR CLOTHES.
UH-HUH.

06:36.167 --> 06:39.733
AND THEN YOU'RE NAKED.
YOU'RE SO HOT... AND NAKED.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.667
(buzzing)
AND THEN ERICA STARTS
KISSING YOU.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.600
(buzz)
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.667
ERICA'S KISSING YOU
LIKE YOU NEED TO BE KISSED.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.767
(buzzing continues)
AND THEN I PIN
YOUR HANDS...

06:47.800 --> 06:48.733
MM.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.367
MM. HOLD ON A MINUTE.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.700
(buzzing continues)
ABOVE YOUR HEAD.

06:52.733 --> 06:56.233
AND THEN I WATCH
AS SHE USES ONE FINGER--
HOLD ON A MINUTE!

06:56.267 --> 06:58.233
***

06:58.267 --> 07:00.700
OOH! OH.

07:00.733 --> 07:02.633
OKAY, I'M SORRY,
'CAUSE THAT WAS GOOD FOR ME--

07:02.667 --> 07:05.633
THAT WAS REALLY,
REALLY GOOD FOR ME. GOOD BOY.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.667
BUT I HAVE A BIG TRAUMA
COMING IN DOWNSTAIRS,

07:07.700 --> 07:11.067
SO, UM, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO THIS THE FAST WAY, OKAY?

07:11.100 --> 07:14.433
***

07:14.467 --> 07:15.833
(sighs)

07:15.867 --> 07:18.500
EVERY PAGE NEEDS TO GO
IN EVERY SET OF DOCUMENTS.

07:18.533 --> 07:19.767
MISS ONE, AND YOU'RE ON SCUT
FOR A MONTH.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.767
THESE ARE THE MOST PROMISING SET
OF CLINICAL TRIAL PATIENTS YET,

07:22.800 --> 07:24.233
AND I DON'T WANT
ANY MISTAKES.
(Lexie under breath)
HARDASS.

07:24.267 --> 07:26.833
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
I HAD TO STAY WITH CRISTINA.
SHE NEEDED ME.

07:26.867 --> 07:30.167
THAT'S SO NICE. BUT REBECCA'S
AT THE HOUSE. I NEEDED YOU.
APPARENTLY SHE'S CRAZY.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.100
NOW, GEORGE,
WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION,

07:32.133 --> 07:34.467
AND WE DECIDED THAT IT'S NOT
APPROPRIATE TO CALL IZZIE CRAZY.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.333
SHE'S SPIRITED.
SPIRITED.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.733
YEAH. NOT ME! I'M NOT CRAZY.
REBECCA'S CRAZY.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.667
AND--AND ALEX IS PRETENDING
SHE'S NOT. IT'S--

07:40.700 --> 07:43.100
HELLO.
H--I-I WAS JUST HELPING
MEREDITH COLLATE.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.833
I'M ON MY WAY TO CHECK ON YOUR
PATIENTS RIGHT NOW. I SWEAR.

07:45.867 --> 07:48.067
THAT'S FINE.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.567
YOU SEEM... CHEERFUL.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.133
I'M GETTIN' MY GROOVE BACK.
I'M GETTIN' JIGGY WITH IT.

07:53.167 --> 07:55.100
I'M GETTIN' DOWN
WITH THE... GET DOWN.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.833
MEREDITH GAVE ME
THE SPARKLE PAGER.
WHAT?!

07:57.867 --> 08:00.767
SHE NEEDED IT FOR HER MOJO.
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK
THAT MAYBE I NEEDED IT?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.833
OH, YOU'D WASTE
THE SPARKLE PAGER.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.300
I NEED IT TO GET OUT
FROM UNDER HAHN.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.533
I WON'T HAVE TO BEG HER FOR
O.R. TIME IF I HAVE THE PAGER.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.800
YOU KNOW,
IF SHE'S NOT GONNA TEACH ME,

08:09.833 --> 08:11.800
I'M GONNA TEACH MYSELF.
SHE'S JUST GONNA
USE IT FOR EVIL.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.667
I... I WOULD USE IT
TO DO GOOD.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.600
AND BESIDES, THE PAGER
IS SACRED. SACRED SPARKLE.

08:15.633 --> 08:18.267
(chuckles) YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE
IT AWAY. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.433
RIGHT? SHE CAN'T DO THAT.
I THINK IT'S NONTRANSFERABLE.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.367
YOU DON'T MAKE THE RULES.
(gasps)

08:22.400 --> 08:25.067
BUT I AM THE CHIEF'S INTERN.
UH, YOU'RE THE CHIEF'S BITCH.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.833
AND YOU HAVE NO POWER...
(pager beeping)

08:26.867 --> 08:29.567
BECAUSE THE POWER--OH!
(singsongy) IS IN THE PAGER.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.467
OH, LOOK, THAT'S THE CHIEF

08:31.500 --> 08:32.833
WITH SOMETHING
IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL.

08:32.867 --> 08:34.767
NO NEED FOR PAGERS
COVERED WITH GLUE AND GLITTER

08:34.800 --> 08:36.833
WHEN YOU WORK FOR THE CHIEF.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.200
ABOUT REBECCA--
ME AND MY WORLD-CLASS
NEUROSURGEON

08:39.233 --> 08:41.333
ARE GONNA USE A BRILLIANT,
CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUE

08:41.367 --> 08:42.600
TO SAVE A LIFE.

08:42.633 --> 08:46.233
SO I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR CRAZY.
WORK IT OUT.
(mouths words)

08:46.267 --> 08:50.767
(pager beeps)

08:50.800 --> 08:52.733
OOH! A TRAUMA.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.100
(siren wailing)

08:54.133 --> 08:56.467
WHAT DO WE GOT?
IT'S NOT, "WHAT DO WE GOT?"
IT'S WHAT DO I GOT,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.400
AND I DON'T KNOW YET.
WELL, CHECK
THE SPARKLE PAGER RULES

08:58.433 --> 09:00.400
'CAUSE WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S MINE NOW.
HEY, WHAT DO WE HAVE?

09:00.433 --> 09:02.667
I DON'T KNOW YET.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.167
NO!
(mutters) SPARKLE PAGER.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.167
YOU CAN'T SPARKLE PAGER IT.
IT'S NOT HER PAGER.
UH, YANG, IT'S YOURS.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.533
STEVENS,
YOU NEED TO COVER THE PIT.

09:08.567 --> 09:11.367
AND DIDN'T YOU VOLUNTEER
TO OVERSEE KAREV'S POST-OPS?
YES, BUT I--

09:11.400 --> 09:14.067
COME ON. I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR PETTINESS. GO.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.200
HEY, CALLIE.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.500
HI. HELLO, ERICA.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

09:18.533 --> 09:19.700
NOTHING. JUST--N-NOTHING.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.400
YOU LOOK ALL HOT
AND BOTHERED.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.733
NO. IT'S JUST--
THERE'S A TRAUMA,

09:24.767 --> 09:26.767
AND IT'S REALLY BIG.
THAT'S ALL.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.333
IT'S BIG. IT'S A BIG TRAUMA.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.500
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.233
(lowered voice) SHE USES
ONE FINGER--
REALLY BIG TRAUMA.

09:33.267 --> 09:35.367
I SWEAR, TORRES,
IT'S LIKE YOU NEVER SEEN

09:35.400 --> 09:37.400
A REALLY BIG TRAUMA BEFORE.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.267
OH, MY.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.733
(whispers)
REALLY BIG TRAUMA.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.467
SO HOW DO YOU WANT
TO HANDLE THIS?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.567
UH...

09:58.133 --> 10:00.433
UH...

10:00.467 --> 10:03.767
HELP ME.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.300
REALLY BIG TRAUMA.

10:09.633 --> 10:12.767
PLEASE...

10:12.800 --> 10:13.767
HELP ME.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.633
Captioning provided by
ABC Studios, ABC, Inc.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.800
and brought to you by Ford.

10:20.733 --> 10:22.833
LOOK, WE WERE
JUST JOKING AROUND.

10:22.867 --> 10:25.433
YEAH, IT WAS--
IT WAS A DARE.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.033
(laughter)
YOU DARED... HIM

10:27.067 --> 10:29.767
TO LAY IN A VAT OF CEMENT
AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.700
HEY, WE NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D DO IT. I-IT'S ANDY.

10:31.733 --> 10:34.567
HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING.
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE GUTS, RIGHT?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.800
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

10:36.833 --> 10:38.733
YOU SNUCK INTO
A CONSTRUCTION SITE

10:38.767 --> 10:41.233
AND DARED YOUR FRIEND--
(girl laughs)
HE'S NOT OUR FRIEND.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.167
I MEAN, THE FOUR OF US,
WE'RE FRIENDS.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.100
BUT, UH, HE'S NOT REALLY
OUR FRIEND.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.767
OKAY, YOU DARED HIM
TO LIE DOWN IN CONCRETE.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.267
NOBODY MADE HIM DO IT.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.533
YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE
WE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.633
(scoffs) HOW LONG?

10:56.667 --> 10:58.333
(girl) WHAT?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.267
HOW LONG DID YOUR NOT FRIEND

11:00.300 --> 11:02.333
LAY IN THAT VAT OF CEMENT
UNABLE TO MOVE

11:02.367 --> 11:04.100
BEFORE YOU FOUR GENIUSES,

11:04.133 --> 11:06.167
YOU BAND OF BROTHERS,
YOU FUTURE MOTHER TERESAS--

11:06.200 --> 11:09.067
HOW LONG DID HE LAY THERE
IN THAT QUICK DRYING CEMENT

11:09.100 --> 11:12.633
YELLING THAT HE COULDN'T MOVE
BEFORE YOU CALLED THE POLICE?

11:12.667 --> 11:16.467
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

11:19.533 --> 11:21.433
NOW YOU SEE THE CYTOPLASMIC
VIRAL PARTICLES

11:21.467 --> 11:25.167
IN THE MALIGNANT CELLS
BUT NOT IN THE NORMAL TISSUE?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.100
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

11:27.133 --> 11:29.233
BUT IT SOUNDS BRILLIANT.
(laughs)

11:29.267 --> 11:32.200
BORING, BUT BRILLIANT.
WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.133
I MEANT GOING TO THE MOVIES
OR BALL GAMES.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.767
BUT A CLINICAL TRIAL'S
JUST AS GOOD.
HI.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.700
HEY. UH, COMBINING THE Fr1904
AND TRICHOSTATIN

11:38.733 --> 11:41.233
INCREASES THE EXPRESSION
OF THE VIRUS IN THE TUMOR.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.467
DID YOU INTRODUCE THEM DURING
THE "M" PHASE OF THE CELL CYCLE?
EXACTLY.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.300
MM-HMM. BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
WITH OUR NAME WRITTEN ON IT.
(chuckles)

11:47.333 --> 11:49.833
SEE? SHE UNDERSTANDS
HOW BRILLIANT YOU ARE.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.700
OKAY. SO JEREMY WEST
IS PATIENT NUMBER 12.
MM-HMM.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.633
AND PATIENT NUMBER 13
IS BETH MONROE.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.833
JEREMY IS SUFFERING FROM
GRAND MAL SEIZURES,

11:55.867 --> 11:58.833
AND BETH IS PARALYZED
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER BODY.

11:58.867 --> 12:01.100
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO MEET FIRST?
JEREMY'S SURGERY IS TODAY.

12:01.133 --> 12:03.600
BETH'S ISN'T UNTIL TOMORROW.
GOD, THEY'RE YOUNG.
YEAH, WHICH MAKES 'EM
RESILIENT.

12:03.633 --> 12:04.800
OKAY.
OKAY.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.467
SEE YOU.
BYE.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.433
(sighs)

12:07.467 --> 12:09.433
CLINICAL TRIAL... FUN.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.333
(man) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO FIRST?

12:11.367 --> 12:13.500
I DON'T KNOW.

12:13.533 --> 12:17.700
OKAY. WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT US TO DO FIRST?
I DON'T KNOW.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.767
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WE BLASTED HIM
OUT OF THE JOB SITE,

12:19.800 --> 12:22.500
BUT WE FIGURED,
DON'T BLAST HIM TOO CLOSE.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.433
BUT THIS IS
A LOT OF CONCRETE,

12:24.467 --> 12:27.233
SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING
ON TREATING HIM,

12:27.267 --> 12:30.667
WE NEED TO GET STARTED.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW!

12:32.367 --> 12:35.367
(crying)

12:35.400 --> 12:37.700
I'M SORRY.

12:37.733 --> 12:41.167
UH, OKAY, I-I KNOW I'M NOT
DOING MY BEST

12:41.200 --> 12:43.667
TO INSTILL A SENSE
OF CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITIES.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.600
UM, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT

12:45.633 --> 12:47.433
YOU ARE TRAPPED IN

12:47.467 --> 12:50.333
WHAT I'M GUESSING IS
SEVERAL TONS OF CEMENT,

12:50.367 --> 12:52.700
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A BOY--
WAIT, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

12:52.733 --> 12:55.333
19.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.233
N--OH.
THEN YOU'RE A MAN THEN.

12:57.267 --> 12:59.367
I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN
TRAPPED IN SEVERAL TONS

12:59.400 --> 13:01.133
OF CEMENT BEFORE.

13:01.167 --> 13:03.700
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE,
I'M GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT.

13:03.733 --> 13:05.633
OKAY, I'M--I'M GONNA WORK
WITH OTHER SURGEONS,

13:05.667 --> 13:08.600
AND WE'RE GOING TO
FIGURE OUT A PLAN

13:08.633 --> 13:10.733
AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU.
(whimpers)

13:10.767 --> 13:12.700
OKAY, I NEVER,
EVER PROMISE LIFE,

13:12.733 --> 13:15.233
BUT I'M PROMISING THIS TO YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

13:15.267 --> 13:17.533
MM. I DO.
OKAY.

13:17.567 --> 13:18.733
I-I DON'T KNOW MUCH YET,

13:18.767 --> 13:20.667
BUT THE ONE THING I DO KNOW

13:20.700 --> 13:22.567
IS THAT THE CEMENT
YOU'RE ENCASED IN

13:22.600 --> 13:25.200
IS SLOWLY LEECHING
THE WATER FROM YOUR BODY,

13:25.233 --> 13:28.633
AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED
ALL THE WATER YOU CAN GET,

13:28.667 --> 13:30.600
SO NO CRYING.

13:30.633 --> 13:34.500
YOU'RE A STRONG YOUNG MAN.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.
YEAH.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.600
GOOD.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.067
GOOD.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.767
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA LIVE.

13:41.800 --> 13:46.233
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU LIVE.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.167
(grunting)

13:48.200 --> 13:49.667
HERE YOU GO.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.367
(grunts)

13:54.367 --> 13:55.600
HELLO.

13:55.633 --> 13:56.567
HELLO.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.633
(woman)
DR. GREY, IS THIS HIM?

13:58.667 --> 14:01.267
HIM?
OH, SHE HAS
A PET NAME FOR YOU.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.367
OH.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.767
THE SEATTLE GRACE
BRAIN BUTCHER.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.367
(laughs) OH.
BETH. I'M SORRY.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.333
OH, NO, NO, THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S ME. HI. DR. SHEPHERD.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.600
HOW DO YOU DO?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU AS WELL.

14:10.633 --> 14:14.067
PLEASURE.
UM, THAT HAND'S
JUST FOR SHOW.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.800
SO COME ON, TELL ME.
HOW DOES THIS WORK?

14:15.833 --> 14:19.167
YOU'RE GOING TO INJECT
A LIVE VIRUS INTO HER TUMOR?
MM-HMM.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.067
AND THAT'S SAFE?
WELL, THE VIRUS IS STILL
IN TESTING STAGES.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.733
I'VE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT
I HOPE WILL DESTROY THE TUMOR.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.633
HEY, TUMOR DESTROYERS.
I LIKE THAT.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.400
HAS THIS EVER WORKED BEFORE?

14:30.433 --> 14:33.300
NO.
(Beth) SO I'M YOUR LAB RAT.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.400
(man) BETH.
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF THIS WORKS,

14:35.433 --> 14:38.800
MY NAME WILL GO DOWN IN
THE ANNALS OF SOME MEDICAL BOOK.

14:38.833 --> 14:42.200
THAT'S KINDA COOL.
NOT IF I BEAT YOU TO IT.

14:42.233 --> 14:45.067
(Meredith) OH, BETH. THIS IS OUR
OTHER CLINICAL TRIAL PATIENT.
JEREMY.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.600
YOU DIDN'T CALL.
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER?

14:47.633 --> 14:51.400
I THOUGHT YOU BACKED OUT.
OH, AS IF I'D BREAK OUR PACT?
COME HERE. (laughs)

14:51.433 --> 14:54.067
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.800
(Beth laughs)

14:59.833 --> 15:03.400
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?
WELL, HIS SURGERY
IS THIS AFTERNOON.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.667
I KNEW SHE DIDN'T FIND THIS
CLINICAL TRIAL ON HER OWN.

15:05.700 --> 15:09.500
BIZARRE, EXPERIMENTAL SURGERY--
IT HAD TO BE JEREMY.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.400
THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE BOTH
BEING TREATED AT MAYO LAST YEAR.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.533
THEY WENT THROUGH
CHEMO TOGETHER, RADIATION,

15:14.567 --> 15:17.267
JOINED A SUPPORT GROUP.
(Meredith) YOU DON'T
WANT THEM TO BE TOGETHER?

15:17.300 --> 15:20.067
LOOK, WE LIKE JEREMY.
HE'S A GOOD ENOUGH KID.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.800
AND I FEEL FOR HIM THAT HE'S
GOING THROUGH THIS ALONE,

15:22.833 --> 15:24.767
BUT WE WORRY ABOUT BETH.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.167
SHE THINKS
THAT SHE'S IN LOVE WITH HIM.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.200
WE JUST DON'T WANT HER
GETTING SO ATTACHED

15:29.233 --> 15:31.067
TO SOMEONE THAT MIGHT...

15:31.067 --> 15:32.633
DIE.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.767
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,
IF HE DOESN'T SURVIVE...

15:35.800 --> 15:38.800
BETH WON'T WANT TO LIVE.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.467
SHE'S MY ONLY CHILD.
SHE HAS TO...

15:42.500 --> 15:46.700
SHE HAS TO WANT TO FIGHT
TO STAY ALIVE.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.133
YOU PAGED?

15:52.167 --> 15:54.067
OH, O'MALLEY,
THERE'S A BINDER

15:54.100 --> 15:55.767
ON OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE
ARTICLES IN MY OFFICE.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.700
THERE SHOULD BE
A TOXICOLOGY SECTION.

15:57.733 --> 15:59.633
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANYTHING ON CEMENT.
YES, SIR.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.300
AND LET SHEPHERD OR GREY KNOW
I NEED TO SEE THEM.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.667
IT'S IMPORTANT.
WILL DO.

16:03.700 --> 16:07.667
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.200
MY GOD.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.733
WHY--WH--

16:14.767 --> 16:17.100
WHAT IS EVERYBODY DOING
STANDING AROUND HERE?

16:17.133 --> 16:19.733
THIS IS WHAT YOUR GUYS
TOLD US TO DO.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.400
AND EXACTLY WHERE ARE
MY GUYS?

16:22.433 --> 16:25.333
(indistinct yelling)

16:25.367 --> 16:28.733
(Mark) ...NO MORE TIME.
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
(Callie) I AM TELLING YOU,
I AM RIGHT.

16:28.767 --> 16:31.633
WHY IS THE PATIENT IN THERE
AND ALL OF YOU ARE IN HERE?

16:31.667 --> 16:33.567
(Cristina) DR. TORRES IS WORRIED
ABOUT THE LIMBS.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.100
DR. BAILEY IS WORRIED ABOUT
ABDOMINAL CRUSH INJURIES.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.067
UH, DR. SLOAN FEELS
THE THIRD-DEGREE BURNS

16:38.067 --> 16:39.400
SHOULD TAKE THE FIRST LOOK,

16:39.433 --> 16:41.700
AND DR. HAHN FEELS
THE HEART AND LUNG ISSUES

16:41.733 --> 16:44.500
ARE GONNA KILL HIM BEFORE,
UM, WE GET TO ANY OF THIS.
SO IN OTHER WORDS--

16:44.533 --> 16:47.633
NO ONE CAN AGREE
ON WHERE TO START.
NO, I KNOW WHERE TO START...

16:47.667 --> 16:51.700
(Mark, Erica, Callie and Miranda
all talking at once)

17:15.633 --> 17:17.133
THE CEMENT'S CONTRACTING,
AND IF I DON'T GET IN THERE,

17:17.167 --> 17:18.800
HE COULD LOSE BOTH OF HIS LEGS
AND HIS RIGHT ARM.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.467
WELL, HE CAN LIVE
WITHOUT A LEG.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.467
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM LIVE
WITHOUT A LIVER.
SO WE'RE SAYING
WE'D PREFER HIM TO SUFFER

17:23.500 --> 17:25.833
A LONG, SLOW, PAINFUL DEATH
AS THE ALKALINE IN THE CEMENT

17:25.867 --> 17:29.233
CONTINUES TO BURN
THROUGH HIS SKIN?
YOU CAN'T JUST START
CHIPPING AWAY.

17:29.267 --> 17:32.133
ONCE HIS CIRCULATION OPENS UP,
THE BUILT-UP TOXINS

17:32.167 --> 17:35.533
WILL STOP HIS HEART,
NOT TO MENTION RHABDOMYOL--
WE COULD TREAT THAT
WITH DIALYSIS.

17:35.567 --> 17:38.567
YANG, LET US WORK.
CHIEF, I FOUND AN ARTICLE,
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY A LOT.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.700
(Erica) I CAN
PUT IN A SWAN-GANZ.
PEOPLE ENCASED IN CEMENT

17:40.733 --> 17:42.800
ARE ALSO USUALLY
AT THE BOTTOM OF A RIVER.
THAT'S GOING
A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.533
YOU ARE SO WRONG.
I'M SO WRONG?

17:44.567 --> 17:47.100
(Callie) YOU ARE. WRONG.
YOU TWO WORKING
TOGETHER ON THIS?

17:47.133 --> 17:49.800
OKAY, EVERYBODY STAND DOWN! WE
ARE FIGHTING THE CLOCK, PEOPLE.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.067
IT TOOK ONE HOUR FOR THE KIDS
TO CALL 9-1-1.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.533
IT TOOK THREE HOURS
FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE

17:53.567 --> 17:55.600
TO GET THIS GUY
CUT OUT OF THE CEMENT.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.533
THAT GIVES US
LESS THAN FOUR TO SIX HOURS

17:57.567 --> 17:59.533
TO GET HIM OUT OF THE CEMENT

17:59.567 --> 18:01.733
AND INTO THE O.R.
BEFORE HE IS DEAD.

18:01.767 --> 18:04.267
NOW WE ARE FIGHTING
ONE HELL OF A CLOCK.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.267
EVERY MINUTE COUNTS.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.433
WE WORK AS A TEAM
OR THAT MAN DIES.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.367
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YES, SIR. OF COURSE.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.300
OF COURSE, SIR.
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME, CHIEF?

18:12.333 --> 18:14.233
GO FIND GREY
AND BE HER INTERN FOR THE DAY.

18:14.267 --> 18:17.067
I ALREADY HAVE
TOO MANY BODIES IN THE ROOM.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.633
WHAT'S THE PATIENT'S NAME?
ANDREW LANGSTON.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.467
OKAY, LET'S GO SAVE HIS LIFE.

18:25.233 --> 18:27.233
HEY.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.367
YOU INTIMIDATE ME A LITTLE.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.667
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
AN INTIMIDATING PERSON,

18:34.700 --> 18:37.300
BUT THE LEGEND...

18:37.333 --> 18:38.700
OF MEREDITH AND DEREK...

18:38.733 --> 18:41.233
IT'S... INTIMIDATING.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.167
THERE'S NO LEGEND.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.333
HE'S SELLING HIS LAND
BECAUSE OF YOU.

18:45.367 --> 18:46.700
THERE'S A LEGEND.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.233
DEREK'S SELLING HIS LAND?

18:48.267 --> 18:50.200
HE DOESN'T SAY
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU,

18:50.233 --> 18:52.133
BUT HE WAS MAKING PLANS
TO BUILD A HOUSE

18:52.167 --> 18:54.067
WHEN THE TWO OF YOU
WERE TOGETHER, AND NOW--

18:54.100 --> 18:57.433
I'M--I'M NOT TRYING TO...
(sighs)

18:57.467 --> 19:00.233
I JUST REALLY LIKE HIM.

19:00.267 --> 19:04.300
AND YOU... INTIMIDATE ME.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.633
THERE'S NO LEGEND.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.800
OKAY.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.733
OKAY.

19:10.767 --> 19:13.767
OKAY.

19:16.667 --> 19:19.667
(men speaking indistinctly)

19:23.100 --> 19:26.633
IZZIE HAD A QUESTION
ABOUT SOME POST-OPS.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.067
(sighs)

19:29.067 --> 19:30.233
WHAT'D I MISS?

19:30.267 --> 19:31.700
WHAT?

19:31.733 --> 19:33.633
THE MOVIE, WHAT'D I MISS?

19:33.667 --> 19:35.567
(man) AND DON'T WEAR
YOUR HIGH HAT.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.800
(man) NO HIGH HAT?

19:36.833 --> 19:38.733
(man) NO HIGH HAT.
AND FROM YOU, CANELL...

19:38.767 --> 19:41.100
HEY. HEY.

19:41.133 --> 19:42.467
I'M SORRY.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.800
DON'T BE SORRY.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.733
I... I THINK...

19:46.767 --> 19:50.167
I WET MY PANTS.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.100
(men speaking indistinctly)

19:52.133 --> 19:54.067
OH.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.733
OH, THAT'S, UH, THAT'S OKAY.

19:59.267 --> 20:02.233
THAT'S--THAT'S OKAY.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.500
I'LL DO BETTER.
I PROMISE.

20:04.533 --> 20:08.533
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.300
COME ON.

20:15.633 --> 20:18.200
(sniffles)

20:21.067 --> 20:23.500
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
GUESS WHO CALLED ME.

20:23.533 --> 20:25.433
CARRIE
FROM OUR SUPPORT GROUP?

20:25.467 --> 20:27.367
YEAH. SHE DIDN'T SOUND
SO GOOD.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.533
HAVE YOU
TALKED TO HER LATELY?

20:29.567 --> 20:31.233
NO, SHE...

20:31.267 --> 20:33.267
OH, GOD.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.767
HER HUSBAND SAID

20:34.800 --> 20:37.733
THAT THEY TRIED RADIATION
ONE LAST TIME.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.667
HE SAID IT WAS BAD.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.700
THE LAST DAY,
SHE DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.833
AND THE PAIN...
SHE WAS SCREAMING

20:43.867 --> 20:45.633
AND BEGGING THEM TO...

20:45.667 --> 20:47.567
HE SAID IT WAS BAD.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.633
OH.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.100
YEAH.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.467
HEY.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.533
AT LEAST WE DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.300
YOU KNOW?

20:57.333 --> 20:59.267
THIS SURGERY WILL WORK.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.067
OKAY?

21:01.100 --> 21:03.067
AND--AND IF IT DOESN'T,

21:03.100 --> 21:05.833
AT LEAST WE'LL DIE QUICK.

21:05.867 --> 21:08.167
(chuckles)

21:11.700 --> 21:16.100
YEAH, WE'LL DIE SUPER FAST
AND--AND WITHOUT PAIN.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.067
YES, EXACTLY.

21:18.067 --> 21:22.500
DR. GREY, I THOUGHT WE TALKED
ABOUT CHANGING BETH'S ROOM.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.800
IT ISN'T SUNNY ENOUGH
IN HERE.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.167
THE ROOM IS FINE,

21:26.200 --> 21:28.233
AND IT'S RIGHT DOWN THE HALL
FROM JEREMY.

21:28.267 --> 21:30.800
I'D LIKE TO MOVE HER
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.733
I'M SORRY, MRS. MONROE,
I CHECKED,

21:32.767 --> 21:34.667
AND THERE AREN'T
ANY BEDS AVAILABLE.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.800
NOT IN A PRIVATE ROOM.

21:36.833 --> 21:39.567
(mouths words)

21:41.133 --> 21:43.367
MOM, WHY DON'T YOU GO
FIND DAD?

21:43.400 --> 21:45.300
UH, I-I CAN WAIT
FOR HIM HERE.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.100
(sighs)

21:47.133 --> 21:49.067
MOM, WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIND DAD

21:49.067 --> 21:51.600
SO I CAN KISS JEREMY
WITHOUT YOU WATCHING?

21:51.633 --> 21:53.533
I THINK IT'S TIME
JEREMY WENT BACK TO--

21:53.567 --> 21:55.400
MOM,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WH--

21:55.433 --> 21:57.467
(chokes)

21:57.500 --> 21:58.700
NURSE!

21:58.733 --> 22:00.533
(gagging)

22:00.567 --> 22:04.767
(Meredith) I NEED A NURSE!
HE'S SEIZING!

22:06.500 --> 22:07.700
ALL RIGHT.

22:07.733 --> 22:11.433
LET'S RUN A SECOND SET
OF LABS BEFORE SURGERY.

22:11.467 --> 22:13.333
HOW'S BETH?

22:13.367 --> 22:15.267
WAS SH--WAS SHE SCARED?
OR...

22:15.300 --> 22:17.133
OH, SHE'S FINE.

22:17.167 --> 22:20.167
UH, THE CHIEF WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU OR SHEPHERD.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.300
HE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT.
I'LL GO.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.700
AND HE PUT ME ON YOU TODAY. SO
WHAT CAN I DO? HOW CAN I HELP?

22:24.733 --> 22:27.467
OH, YOU CAN, UH,
RUN LABS FOR ME.
LABS, THAT'S IT?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.300
YEAH. THANKS.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.567
YEAH. HI.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.100
WHAT'S THAT?

22:42.133 --> 22:44.067
I'M POURING VINEGAR
ON YOUR FLESH

22:44.067 --> 22:45.800
TO MINIMIZE THE BURNS
INSIDE YOUR SKIN

22:45.833 --> 22:47.733
CAUSED BY THE CEMENT.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.800
I'M BURNING
FROM THE INSIDE OUT?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.500
I'M DYING.
I'M DYING, AREN'T I?

22:54.533 --> 22:57.300
HEY, HEY, ANDREW. THAT WORD'S
NOT ALLOWED ANYMORE.

22:57.333 --> 22:59.300
I'M BANNING THAT WORD
FROM YOUR VOCABULARY.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.667
CAN YOU MOVE YOUR FINGERS?

23:01.700 --> 23:03.333
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

23:03.367 --> 23:06.700
I'M NOT USUALLY THIS DUMB.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.633
MOST PEOPLE THINK
I'M PRETTY SMART.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.667
I MAKE THE DEAN'S LIST.
I TUTOR.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.667
I'M--I'M NOT...

23:13.700 --> 23:15.600
I'M NOT USUALLY THE GUY
WHO'S DUMB ENOUGH

23:15.633 --> 23:18.400
TO JUMP INTO A TUB OF CEMENT
FOR A GIRL.

23:18.433 --> 23:21.433
WAIT, NOT THE GIRL
YOU CAME IN WITH?

23:21.467 --> 23:23.367
YOU DID THIS FOR HER?

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
LOLA.

23:24.433 --> 23:26.167
THE GUYS DARED ME.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.600
SHE WAS WATCHING.

23:27.633 --> 23:29.067
AND I...

23:29.100 --> 23:31.433
(chuckles) SHE WAS WATCHING.

23:31.467 --> 23:33.767
(inhales sharply) OH.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.300
MM. MM.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.067
AND NOW NOT ONLY
IS SHE TOTALLY UNIMPRESSED,

23:39.067 --> 23:40.800
BUT AFTER I'M GONE,

23:40.833 --> 23:43.667
SHE'LL REMEMBER ME FOREVER
AS THE IDIOT

23:43.700 --> 23:47.200
WHO WAS DUMB ENOUGH
TO JUMP INTO A TUB OF CEMENT.

23:47.233 --> 23:49.133
PEOPLE WILL WRITE STORIES
ABOUT MY IDIOCY

23:49.167 --> 23:51.200
AND FORWARD THEM
TO THEIR FRIENDS.

23:51.233 --> 23:53.200
I'M GONNA DIE
AS A BAD E-MAIL FORWARD.

23:53.233 --> 23:55.300
HEY, COME ON.
WE ALL MESS UP.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.333
I'M THE GUY WHO DIED
IN A BLOCK OF CEMENT

23:57.367 --> 23:59.733
TRYING TO IMPRESS A GIRL.

23:59.767 --> 24:02.767
I'M LIKE HAN SOLO.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.300
IN "STAR WARS"?

24:06.333 --> 24:08.233
HE WAS ENCASED IN CARBONITE?

24:08.267 --> 24:09.400
(mutters)

24:13.167 --> 24:15.333
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

24:15.367 --> 24:18.400
I, UH, I GOT A CALL
FROM THE I.R.B.--

24:18.433 --> 24:21.233
THE NATIONAL BOARD THAT OVERSEES
AND REVIEWS CLINICAL TRIALS--

24:21.267 --> 24:22.833
YOUR CLINICAL TRIAL.

24:22.867 --> 24:25.467
YOU'VE HAD 11 DEATHS.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.400
THEY'RE GIVING YOU
ONE LAST PATIENT.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.600
YOU GET IT TODAY UNDER THE WIRE,
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

24:29.633 --> 24:32.067
AT MIDNIGHT, IF YOU LOSE HIM,

24:32.067 --> 24:34.567
THEY'RE GONNA
SHUT YOU DOWN, PERIOD.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.667
ONE LAST PATIENT.

24:36.700 --> 24:40.367
YOU'RE ANGRY AT HIM--
THE CHIEF.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.367
BUT WHY?
WHY AM I ANGRY AT HIM?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.267
BECAUSE YOU HAVE OPENED UP
YOUR PAST.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.167
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
RELIVING IT ALL RIGHT NOW.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.500
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH HIM.
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH YOUR MOTHER.

24:49.533 --> 24:52.400
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH YOURSELF.
THE CHIEF WENT BACK
TO HIS WIFE.

24:52.433 --> 24:54.300
MY MOTHER DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE.
I GET THAT.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.833
HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO.
SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO.

24:56.867 --> 24:59.433
MEREDITH, I DON'T THINK YOUR
MOTHER WANTED TO KILL HERSELF.
NO, SHE DID.

24:59.467 --> 25:01.200
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

25:01.233 --> 25:04.067
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
SHE DIDN'T? YOU WEREN'T THERE.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.467
THE ANSWER
IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.400
THINK ABOUT IT.

25:08.433 --> 25:10.367
(sighs)

25:10.400 --> 25:12.300
THE I.R.B. IS SAYING
I FAILED?
YOU HAVEN'T FAILED YET.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.633
I FAILED MEREDITH. I'LL SIGN
THE DISCHARGE ORDER FOR BETH.

25:14.667 --> 25:17.333
NO, YOU CAN'T SEND BETH HOME.
THIS SURGERY IS HER LAST SHOT.

25:17.367 --> 25:19.267
YOU HAVE UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
JEREMY'S SURGERY'S TODAY.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.633
SO YOU MOVE JEREMY'S SURGERY UP.
WE DO BETH'S THIS AFTERNOON.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.667
YOU CAN FIT THEM BOTH IN
BEFORE THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE.

25:23.700 --> 25:27.067
DAMN IT. IF I COULD JUST
GET THE VIRUS DOSAGE RIGHT.
RIGHT. AND YOU'RE SO CLOSE.
YOU HAVEN'T FAILED.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.400
BUT ARE WE GOING
TOO FAR HERE?

25:29.433 --> 25:32.433
THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES.
(sighs) IS MY EGO TOO BIG HERE?

25:32.467 --> 25:35.067
YOUR EGO
IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.100
WE CAN DO THIS.

25:37.133 --> 25:39.433
TWO PATIENTS.

25:39.467 --> 25:42.467
BENDS THE RULES
WITHOUT BREAKING 'EM.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.567
YOU'LL CLEAR IT
WITH THE CHIEF?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.433
YEAH.

25:47.467 --> 25:49.567
JEREMY'S GOING
INTO SURGERY SOON?

25:49.600 --> 25:51.567
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.067
HOW IS HE?

25:53.100 --> 25:54.500
OH, HE'S STABLE.

25:54.533 --> 25:56.433
YEAH?
YEAH, HE'S ACTUALLY
BETTER THAN STABLE.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.367
HE CALLED ME
THE ANGEL OF DEATH.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.333
(laughs)

25:59.367 --> 26:02.167
HE'S GOOD THEN.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.100
CAN I SEE HIM?

26:04.133 --> 26:06.400
HONEY, NO.

26:06.433 --> 26:08.333
OH, I'LL JUST BE GONE
A FEW MINUTES.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.433
CAN YOU GET ME
A WHEELCHAIR, PLEASE?

26:10.467 --> 26:12.633
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SURGERY
TODAY, YOU NEED TO REST.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.600
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE--
OH--

26:14.633 --> 26:16.533
WE JUST WANT TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH YOU.

26:16.567 --> 26:18.333
THAT'S ALL.
PLEASE.

26:18.367 --> 26:21.367
***

26:21.400 --> 26:23.300
WE'RE THE LAST TWO.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.300
WHAT?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.400
FROM OUR SUPPORT GROUP.

26:27.433 --> 26:30.567
JEREMY AND I ARE
THE LAST TWO STILL ALIVE.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.600
***

26:39.567 --> 26:41.467
HEY.
HAVE YOU SEEN CRISTINA?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.400
BECAUSE I'VE DONE
EVERYTHING I KNOW TO DO,

26:43.433 --> 26:45.333
EVERYTHING
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO,

26:45.367 --> 26:47.267
BUT IF SHE SEES ME
DOING NOTHING,

26:47.300 --> 26:50.433
I AM NOT IN THE MOOD
TO GET YELLED AT TODAY.
SHE'S IN WITH THE CEMENT BOY.

26:50.467 --> 26:52.633
THERE'S A CEMENT BOY?
DON'T BOTHER.
THEY DON'T NEED INTERNS IN--

26:52.667 --> 26:54.567
THEY DON'T WANT INTERNS
IN THERE.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.267
INTERNS ARE IN THE WAY!
I'M NOT COMPLAINING.
TWO MINUTES.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.600
TWO MINUTES OF COMPLAINING
BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

26:59.633 --> 27:02.533
NO ONE HAS TO KNOW.
I HAVE ALL THIS POWER!
SUPPOSEDLY.

27:02.567 --> 27:04.067
I SUPPOSEDLY AM IMBUED

27:04.100 --> 27:05.800
WITH THE POWER OF BEING
THE CHIEF'S INTERN.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.333
BUT THERE'S A CEMENT BOY,

27:07.367 --> 27:09.267
AND I'M STUCK IN HERE,
RUNNING LABS

27:09.300 --> 27:12.067
AND RESEARCHING THE EFFECTS
OF CEMENT ON THE HUMAN BODY

27:12.067 --> 27:14.533
IN THE VAIN HOPES THAT
SOMEBODY ASKS ME A QUESTION.

27:14.567 --> 27:16.600
I'M NOT
IN WITH THE CEMENT BOY

27:16.633 --> 27:20.067
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE
ALL THIS POWER, I CAN'T USE IT

27:20.067 --> 27:22.500
BECAUSE IT'S NOT REAL POWER.
IT'S FAKE POWER?

27:22.533 --> 27:23.733
FAKE POWER.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.667
I CAN GO
INTO THE CHIEF'S OFFICE

27:25.700 --> 27:27.333
WHENEVER I WANT.

27:27.367 --> 27:29.333
YOU KNOW WHAT
HE HAS IN THERE? FILES.

27:29.367 --> 27:31.767
CONFIDENTIAL FILES ON
EVERY RESIDENT IN THIS HOSPITAL.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.700
AND I'M JUST ALLOWED IN,
AND HE'S NOT WORRIED

27:33.733 --> 27:35.633
BECAUSE HE KNOWS AND I KNOW

27:35.667 --> 27:37.700
THAT I DON'T HAVE
ANY REAL POWER.

27:37.733 --> 27:40.367
I DON'T HAVE THE POWER
TO LOOK AT THOSE FILES.
WOULD IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

27:40.400 --> 27:42.767
IF YOU COULD LOOK
AT THE FILES?
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

27:42.800 --> 27:45.667
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
IF I COULD FEEL LIKE

27:45.700 --> 27:49.400
THERE WAS A REASON FOR THIS,
THAT THERE WAS A POINT.

27:49.433 --> 27:52.500
OH, GOD.
MY POOR, POOR PARENTS.

27:52.533 --> 27:55.400
HOW WOULD THEY FACE ANYONE
AT THE FUNERAL?
OH, OKAY, ANDREW,

27:55.433 --> 27:58.233
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT
OF MISTAKES IN YOUR LIFE,

27:58.267 --> 28:00.767
BUT MISTAKES ARE--THEY'RE--
THEY'RE JUST PIECES.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.700
LIKE THIS
IS A FOOLISH PIECE,

28:02.733 --> 28:04.833
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST A PIECE.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.767
YOU NEED TO BE PROUD
OF THE WHOLE PICTURE.

28:06.800 --> 28:10.200
THE WHOLE PICTURE DEFINES YOU,
NOT JUST THIS ONE PIECE.

28:10.233 --> 28:13.567
I'M A LOSER. I'M A LOSER.
I'M A LOSER.
(monitor beeping erratically)

28:13.600 --> 28:15.267
I'M A LOSER.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.367
COME ON. UH, ANDREW.
I'M A LOSER.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.733
ANDREW. HEY, HEY,
L-LISTEN TO ME.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.667
HAN SOLO IS NOT A LOSER.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.067
HAN SOLO GOT ENCASED
IN CARBONITE,

28:24.100 --> 28:25.667
AND--AND THAT WAS A BIG MESS,

28:25.700 --> 28:27.600
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT HE'S REMEMBERED FOR.

28:27.633 --> 28:29.733
HE'S REMEMBERED AS THE GUY
WHO MADE THE KESSEL RUN

28:29.767 --> 28:31.100
IN LESS THAN 12 PARSECS

28:31.133 --> 28:32.833
AND WHO BRAVED
THE SUBZERO TEMPERATURES

28:32.867 --> 28:35.633
OF THE ICE PLANET HOTH
IN ORDER TO SAVE

28:35.667 --> 28:39.067
SOMEONE HE CARED ABOUT
FROM THE BIG, UGLY WAMPA.

28:39.100 --> 28:42.200
HE IS REMEMBERED AS THE GUY WHO
SWOOPED DOWN AT THE LAST MINUTE,

28:42.233 --> 28:44.133
BLASTED DARTH VADER
OUT OF THE SKY

28:44.167 --> 28:46.067
SO THAT LUKE
COULD USE THE FORCE

28:46.100 --> 28:48.567
AND--AND DESTROY
THE DAMN "DEATH STAR," OKAY?

28:48.600 --> 28:51.167
PRINCESS LEIA SAVED HIM
FROM THE CARBONITE...
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:51.200 --> 28:53.600
AND THEY FELL IN LOVE
AND THEY SAVED THE UNIVERSE

28:53.633 --> 28:55.533
AND HAD TWIN JEDI BABIES

28:55.567 --> 28:57.467
THAT WENT ON
TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE AGAIN.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.400
RIGHT? NOW THAT'S
THE WHOLE PICTURE.

28:59.433 --> 29:02.367
THE CARBONITE,
IT WAS JUST A PIECE, OKAY?
(muffled) YEAH.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.100
WHAT?
SO I LIKE SCIENCE FICTION.

29:10.133 --> 29:12.133
SOMEBODY GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
(Erica) NO.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.200
(Mark) NO.
IT'S GREAT.

29:14.233 --> 29:17.067
(Callie)
NO, NOT AT ALL. COOL.
DO WHAT YOU DOING.

29:17.067 --> 29:18.633
(cement crackling)

29:18.667 --> 29:22.533
(panting)

29:22.567 --> 29:25.433
SO I GOT JEREMY'S LABS BACK,
AND HE'S GOOD TO GO FOR SURGERY.

29:25.467 --> 29:27.800
CHIEF SIGN OFF ON THAT?
Y-YEAH.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.433
(panting)

29:29.467 --> 29:31.767
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
GET A WHEELCHAIR.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.300
(panting continues)

29:33.333 --> 29:35.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OH!

29:35.133 --> 29:38.067
MY--MY MOM WENT
TO GO CALL MY GRANDMA,

29:38.067 --> 29:39.800
AND MY DAD WENT
TO THE CAFETERIA.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.600
THERE WASN'T A WHEELCHAIR
IN MY ROOM.

29:41.633 --> 29:43.767
I JUST WANT TO SEE JEREMY.
PLEASE.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.767
I DON'T WANT THE SEIZURE TO BE
THE LAST TIME I SEE HIM.

29:46.800 --> 29:50.467
PLEASE. I-I JUST NEED TO SEE
HIM. PLEASE LET ME SEE HIM.
OKAY, LET'S GO.

29:52.467 --> 29:55.333
AM I GOING TO GET
TO BE ALONE WITH JEREMY?

29:55.367 --> 29:57.267
I MEAN "ALONE" ALONE?

29:57.300 --> 29:59.100
ALONE?

29:59.133 --> 30:02.300
WE'VE NEVER DONE IT,
EITHER OF US.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.767
WE'VE BEEN WAITING UNTIL
WE BOTH WERE TUMOR FREE,

30:04.800 --> 30:07.500
BUT THE SURGERY--
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

30:07.533 --> 30:08.733
WE CAN DO IT, RIGHT?

30:08.767 --> 30:11.367
IT--IT--IT WON'T KILL US
OR ANYTHING?

30:11.400 --> 30:13.100
NO, NO.

30:13.133 --> 30:15.333
NO, IT WON'T KILL YOU.

30:15.367 --> 30:17.400
I MEAN, YOU'VE DONE IT,
RIGHT?

30:17.433 --> 30:19.367
WITH EACH OTHER?

30:19.400 --> 30:21.300
HE--I'VE--HE'S DONE--

30:21.333 --> 30:24.033
HE'S DONE IT,
AND I'VE DONE IT, YEAH.

30:24.067 --> 30:26.133
WHAT'S IT LIKE?
IS IT MAGICAL?
YES.

30:26.167 --> 30:27.733
IT CAN BE.

30:27.767 --> 30:30.167
WITH THE RIGHT PERSON.

30:32.867 --> 30:35.667
I'M GONNA GO GET YOU
SOME CLOTHES.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.767
YOU GOT SHAMPOO IN THERE?

30:37.800 --> 30:41.233
(water running)

30:41.267 --> 30:44.233
(breathing heavily)

30:44.267 --> 30:47.067
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:47.100 --> 30:50.100
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I WAS PREGNANT.

30:50.133 --> 30:52.033
I WAS PREGNANT.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.800
SHH.
I KNOW I WAS.
I WAS PREGNANT.

30:53.833 --> 30:56.300
I DON'T KNOW...
SHH. IT'S OKAY.

30:56.333 --> 30:57.700
SHH.
I DON'T...

30:57.733 --> 30:59.067
IT'S OKAY.
I...

30:59.100 --> 31:01.733
YOU JUST GOT CONFUSED.
THAT'S ALL.

31:01.767 --> 31:03.600
YOU JUST GOT CONFUSED, OKAY?

31:03.633 --> 31:05.267
(sniffles) OKAY.

31:05.300 --> 31:06.233
SHH.

31:06.267 --> 31:08.267
OKAY. OKAY.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
OKAY.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.833
OKAY.

31:11.867 --> 31:14.800
(Priscilla Ahn)
* I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ALONE

31:14.833 --> 31:17.067
* IN MY LITTLE WORLD

31:17.067 --> 31:23.067
* WHO DREAMED OF
A LITTLE HOME FOR ME *

31:23.067 --> 31:25.767
* I PLAYED PRETEND
BETWEEN THE TREES *

31:25.800 --> 31:28.233
* AND FED MY HOUSEGUESTS

31:28.267 --> 31:29.267

31:29.300 --> 31:30.667
* AND LAUGHED

31:30.700 --> 31:34.600
* IN MY PRETTY BED OF GREEN

31:34.633 --> 31:37.267
* I HAD A DREAM

31:37.300 --> 31:41.100
* THAT I COULD FLY

31:41.133 --> 31:44.233
* FROM THE HIGHEST SWING

31:44.267 --> 31:47.767
* I HAD A DREAM

31:51.700 --> 31:54.533
I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE
GOTTEN A PATIENT LAID,

31:54.567 --> 31:56.467
MUCH LESS TWO PATIENTS.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.400
IT'S REALLY SWEET.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.067
WE'RE PIMPS.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.067

32:01.067 --> 32:02.267
YENTAS.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.167
(laughs)
THEY'RE SO IN LOVE.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.100
OH, YEAH.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.767
IT'S ALL NEW AND FRESH
AND EXCITING.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.700
I'VE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF NEW.

32:09.733 --> 32:12.433
I LIKE TO KNOW THE PERSON,
THEIR BODIES,

32:12.467 --> 32:14.567
WHAT MAKES THEM MOAN.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.300
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

32:17.333 --> 32:19.367
BETH ISN'T IN HER ROOM.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.467
OH, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I HAD MY INTERN

32:21.500 --> 32:23.400
TAKE HER DOWN

32:23.433 --> 32:26.300
THANK GOD. I WAS AFRAID
SHE WAS LYING SOMEWHERE IN PAIN.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.800
NO, SHE'S NOT IN ANY PAIN.

32:28.833 --> 32:31.167
WE SHOULD GO
TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM

32:31.200 --> 32:33.500
BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF
CLINICAL TRIAL PAPERWORK

32:33.533 --> 32:35.467

32:46.600 --> 32:48.500
ALL RIGHT.
SO THEN INFLATE IT MORE.
YES, DR. HAHN.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.267
EVERY TIME THEY LOOSEN
ANOTHER PIECE OF CONCRETE,

32:51.300 --> 32:53.567
THIS LEG SWELLS EVEN MORE.
HIS PRESSURE IS 18.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.733
ALL RIGHT, DOES HE HAVE
A PULSE WITH THAT?

32:56.767 --> 33:00.733
I ALWAYS DID ENJOY
A GOOD GAME OF TWISTER.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.200
IT'S FINISHED. I'M IN.

33:07.233 --> 33:09.067

33:11.500 --> 33:13.800
