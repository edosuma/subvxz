00:37.777 --> 00:39.992
<i>The autumn sled across your skin.</i>

00:40.036 --> 00:42.160
<i>Got something in my eye.</i>

00:42.205 --> 00:45.589
<i>A light that does not need to live,
And doesn't need to die.</i>

00:46.457 --> 00:50.581
<i>A riddle in the book of love,
Obscure and obsolete.</i>

00:50.623 --> 00:53.401
<i>Till witnessed here in time and blood.</i>.

00:53.446 --> 00:55.224
<i>A thousand kisses deep.</i>

01:37.065 --> 01:38.929
<i>The ponies run,
The girls are young.</i>

01:38.964 --> 01:40.493
<i>The odds are there to beat.</i>

01:40.972 --> 01:44.617
<i>You win a while and then it's done,
Your little winning streak.</i>

01:44.659 --> 01:49.084
<i>And summoned now to deal,
With your invincible defeat.</i>

01:49.128 --> 01:53.209
<i>You live your life as if it's real,
A thousand kisses deep.</i>

03:15.499 --> 03:18.970
I didn't want to leave it in the hall.
You never know.

03:21.967 --> 03:24.699
- Here you are.
- I don't understand.

03:25.351 --> 03:27.436
- Who delivered it?
- I didn't see.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.042
It's my mother's things.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.864
It must come from the hospice.

03:30.907 --> 03:33.945
They have a duty to pass on artifacts
to the next of kin.

03:33.988 --> 03:36.896
Yeah, I went there.
They gave it to me and I binned it.

03:36.940 --> 03:39.348
Well, here it is.
Somethings is never go away,

03:39.383 --> 03:41.757
you know.
They just keep coming back.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.881
Now, I have work to do.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.356
Let's bring them.

05:41.808 --> 05:42.808
Sorry.

06:20.652 --> 06:22.677
Hey Mia.
You still working nights?

06:22.721 --> 06:24.241
I don't mind. It's quite.

06:57.805 --> 06:58.805
Max!

06:59.237 --> 07:03.012
Who is that woman? The old woman.
Did you see what just happened?

07:03.057 --> 07:04.057
No, I was downstairs.

07:04.099 --> 07:07.831
And there was a dead woman on the
pavement and they just took her away.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.730
I've lived here all my life
and I...

07:10.732 --> 07:13.779
I saw it for the first time
this morning.

07:13.908 --> 07:17.074
You are a very busy young woman.

07:17.117 --> 07:20.156
You work odd hours.
You probably didn't notice them.

07:23.934 --> 07:24.934
You alright?

07:25.060 --> 07:27.189
I need to go upstairs.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.270
Thank you.

08:23.176 --> 08:26.650
- Welcome to Harmony!
- Coffee please.

08:26.694 --> 08:28.080
Have a seat.

08:32.116 --> 08:34.025
Don't you remember me, Buddy?

08:36.977 --> 08:37.977
Mia!

08:38.279 --> 08:40.147
Let me have a look at you!

08:40.581 --> 08:42.402
As gorgeous as ever.

08:43.964 --> 08:46.178
Have you seen Ludwig lately?

08:46.222 --> 08:48.437
He disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

08:49.522 --> 08:50.564
When did you last see him?

08:50.782 --> 08:52.212
Eight years ago.

08:52.255 --> 08:55.208
What, you still looking for him
after all he did to you?

08:55.251 --> 08:58.483
Every time he hurt you,
you crying in my shoulder

08:58.718 --> 09:01.715
and then run right back to him.

09:02.367 --> 09:06.795
Yeah, well. An old woman in my building
jumped out the window this morning.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.616
- Did you know her well?
- I didn't know her at all.

09:10.094 --> 09:13.784
But... she...
knew Ludwig.

09:15.822 --> 09:19.035
This is a photo that I took, what...
10 years ago?

09:19.208 --> 09:21.292
She had this picture with her
when she jumped.

09:21.335 --> 09:22.855
I thought you said you didn't know her.

09:22.899 --> 09:25.109
- Did you give it to anyone else?
- It was for you.

09:27.237 --> 09:29.277
Thanks for the coffee, Buddy.

09:29.321 --> 09:32.445
Mia, love, don't waste it.

09:34.789 --> 09:36.439
You're welcome!

09:49.024 --> 09:50.241
Max.

09:50.762 --> 09:53.237
I haven't forgotten about your radiator.

09:53.281 --> 09:55.107
Oh, never mind about the radiator.

09:55.142 --> 09:58.226
I wanted to ask you about
the old woman upstairs.

09:59.918 --> 10:01.568
She kept to herself.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.781
Rarely went out.

10:04.779 --> 10:08.207
She kept forgetting her key
and her own name.

10:08.728 --> 10:10.552
She had no friends, no family.

10:11.116 --> 10:13.330
I want to take a look at her place.

10:13.372 --> 10:15.978
No, c'mon now!
There is nothing to see.

10:17.109 --> 10:19.843
Her apartment is just like yours.
No difference.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.143
I'll be in and out.
I promise.

10:22.478 --> 10:23.658
Won't do you any good.

10:29.648 --> 10:30.779
I insist.

10:32.122 --> 10:33.122
Alright.

10:50.831 --> 10:52.085
I'll be five minutes.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.417
And you can't touch anything inside.
Nothing!

10:55.560 --> 10:56.688
I swear.

12:41.937 --> 12:44.630
Max, why are
my things in her flat?

12:44.760 --> 12:48.970
My pictures. Letters addressed to me.
Personal things.

12:49.013 --> 12:51.142
- You made a promise.
- But this is mine!

12:51.403 --> 12:54.612
Belongs to me!
It's got my name on it.

12:55.828 --> 12:57.390
You know what you've done?

12:57.433 --> 13:02.424
You see this table? This lamp?
This is where they supposed to be.

13:02.468 --> 13:06.243
This letter does not belong here...
Now.

13:06.676 --> 13:10.498
You made a mistake, Mia.
Time is out of joint.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.536
You have to put it back!

13:24.386 --> 13:25.514
We going down?

13:26.208 --> 13:28.597
This lift has a mind of its own.

13:29.162 --> 13:30.765
Where are we going, Max?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.717
You'll have to wait and see.

13:48.474 --> 13:49.819
Here we are.

13:52.425 --> 13:53.858
We're on the wrong floor.

13:56.243 --> 13:57.762
Max!?

14:09.394 --> 14:12.345
Somebody has been holding off.
You left!

14:14.340 --> 14:17.945
Hey. You look familiar!

14:19.377 --> 14:21.765
I know that we've met.
You are...?

14:21.808 --> 14:23.846
I'm on the wrong floor.
I live upstairs.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.278
You're not gonna to tell me your name?

14:26.755 --> 14:28.445
May I at least tell you mine?

14:29.096 --> 14:30.790
I'm Ludwig.

14:35.393 --> 14:36.519
Well...

14:37.517 --> 14:39.732
Very nice to meet you,
neighbor.

14:46.895 --> 14:48.543
Mia!

14:50.365 --> 14:52.881
My girl.
She likes to play games.

14:54.487 --> 14:57.568
Mia, don't do this to me...

15:03.602 --> 15:06.771
- <i>Happy birthday angel.</i>
- <i>What now.</i>

15:07.205 --> 15:09.029
<i>I brought you flowers.</i>

15:09.072 --> 15:10.853
<i>I don't want your flowers.</i>

15:21.136 --> 15:25.389
<i>You disappeared secretly!
Does Stella know?</i>

15:28.558 --> 15:30.380
<i>I can't take this anymore, Ludwig.</i>

15:30.467 --> 15:31.707
<i>We've been through all this before.</i>

15:34.115 --> 15:35.241
<i>Go away!</i>

15:39.672 --> 15:40.710
<i>Get out!</i>

15:40.797 --> 15:44.575
<i>Won't send me away.
Not today.</i>

15:47.265 --> 15:48.307
Get out!

15:48.480 --> 15:50.084
You want me to leave?

15:53.429 --> 15:54.816
You're so beautiful.

15:56.682 --> 15:59.503
- Like a star from heaven.
- No.

16:01.241 --> 16:05.537
You're so fucking beautiful.
You know that?

16:58.053 --> 16:59.573
Come here.

17:08.035 --> 17:09.207
Come here.

17:34.947 --> 17:36.116
I have to...

17:36.637 --> 17:40.454
I have to, tell you something.

17:44.103 --> 17:48.486
Go to go to New York.
America.

17:49.007 --> 17:53.174
Friend of mine he's line up
some place for me, there.

17:53.695 --> 17:59.944
I mean, I know that
I should have told you any earlier.

18:00.508 --> 18:06.540
It kills me... to think of
be away from you for so long.

18:07.191 --> 18:11.229
I've burnt too many bridges here,
Mia.

18:11.272 --> 18:14.370
I need a fresh start.

18:14.412 --> 18:17.193
And I've got to get back
to the music.

18:17.437 --> 18:22.427
You told me... You told me that...
I'm doing this for us.

18:22.462 --> 18:24.598
You're not coming back, are you?

18:25.291 --> 18:28.414
- How can you say that?
- Don't know!

18:29.065 --> 18:30.977
Trust me, Mia.

18:36.836 --> 18:38.354
Angel...

18:39.265 --> 18:40.481
I hate you.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.473
I'll be back
before you know it. I promise.

19:15.293 --> 19:16.549
Lilly, hey!

19:36.600 --> 19:37.860
You didn't put it back?

19:38.077 --> 19:39.814
I didn't have chance to.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.549
The cat shouldn't be here.

19:42.287 --> 19:43.850
Everything is out of place.

19:43.893 --> 19:45.541
I just want to go home, Max.

19:45.889 --> 19:47.191
So do I.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.425
Lilly...

20:15.654 --> 20:19.265
<i>Oops, I shouldn't be in here.
You going to get water into my trumpet.</i>

20:20.046 --> 20:21.433
<i>Not tonight.</i>

20:22.085 --> 20:24.994
<i>Don't press me, Mia.
Or I won't be able to play a tune.</i>

20:31.288 --> 20:32.677
- <i>Yay!</i>
- <i>♫ ... ♫</i>

21:11.088 --> 21:12.865
<i>You're a sculptural.</i>

21:20.983 --> 21:22.110
You know?

21:22.762 --> 21:25.237
You know
we weren't very happy there?

21:26.536 --> 21:28.925
That's... It's because I wasn't.

21:30.142 --> 21:32.355
Your mother,
<i>she reminds me of someone.</i>

21:32.657 --> 21:34.741
Those ridiculous glasses!

21:35.437 --> 21:37.237
My father gave them to her
on their anniversary.

21:37.272 --> 21:39.038
He thought it gave her an air of glamor.

21:39.386 --> 21:40.206
Going to get dressed.

21:40.241 --> 21:42.583
No, you can't go.
It's my birthday!

21:42.718 --> 21:45.026
- Your birthday!
- Ludwig, no, no, no.

21:45.061 --> 21:45.806
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

21:45.851 --> 21:47.067
<i>Oh, c'mon.</i>

21:48.457 --> 21:52.057
Please stay, I'll put milk in your
brown lulu. You would like it.

21:52.536 --> 21:56.052
Put milk in my brown lulu
the way I like it.

21:57.875 --> 22:01.087
Speaking of which,
where is my watch?

22:01.130 --> 22:02.397
<i>Come on!</i>

22:02.432 --> 22:04.816
<i>What are you going to do?</i>
Run back to your old hack?

22:04.851 --> 22:07.031
- Hey!
- Hey what?

22:07.075 --> 22:09.160
Watch your mouth!

22:10.026 --> 22:12.803
I'm not staying here by myself.
I'm going out too.

22:12.847 --> 22:15.147
No, you are not.
You are not going anywhere.

22:15.277 --> 22:18.143
Until you bring me back my watch.

22:18.187 --> 22:20.182
I didn't take your stupid watch!

22:20.226 --> 22:22.875
Yes, you did take my fucking...

22:23.700 --> 22:25.175
fucking watch!

22:25.738 --> 22:28.300
Give me my fucking watch!

22:30.381 --> 22:32.900
You think that's gonna
make me stay here, do you?

22:33.073 --> 22:34.462
Do you?

22:38.282 --> 22:40.190
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

22:41.233 --> 22:42.361
Okay.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.661
What you doing?

22:44.704 --> 22:46.789
Let's play a favorite game.

22:46.962 --> 22:48.359
Oh, please.

22:48.394 --> 22:50.261
- Give me your hands. C'mon.
- Stop.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.166
No, please.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.871
- Hurting me with...
- Shhh...

22:58.071 --> 22:59.722
Stop!

23:03.453 --> 23:04.540
Please!

23:08.965 --> 23:10.007
You know?

23:15.390 --> 23:16.864
Sweetheart, come here.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
Look at me.

23:19.036 --> 23:23.201
Look at me.
I love you so much.

23:25.285 --> 23:26.803
Please...

23:32.013 --> 23:33.791
I hate you!

23:35.398 --> 23:36.830
<i>Ludwig!</i>

23:39.261 --> 23:42.646
<i>Lilly, where are you?</i>

23:44.513 --> 23:45.945
Come here girl!

23:48.332 --> 23:50.294
Are we scare of him?

23:50.329 --> 23:53.453
<i>Just a fake.
He doesn't mean anything bad.</i>

23:54.452 --> 23:56.404
You know he loves me.

23:58.487 --> 23:59.964
<i>Lilly.</i>

24:04.175 --> 24:06.733
<i>Rise and shine, sleepyhead.</i>

24:06.777 --> 24:10.640
Your breakfast is served.

24:12.463 --> 24:15.762
- Really hurt me, you know?
- I know, but you love it.

24:15.805 --> 24:18.498
And you wouldn't have it
any other way.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.842
You really think so?

24:20.307 --> 24:23.112
<i>Trust me. I know you better than
you know yourself.</i>

24:23.213 --> 24:25.802
- <i> Untie me...</i>
- <i>Not until...</i>

24:25.837 --> 24:28.392
you have some breakfast.

24:28.740 --> 24:30.170
C'mon.

24:32.776 --> 24:34.338
Good girl!

24:35.553 --> 24:36.553
Now, tell me.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.502
Do you remember
where you put my watch?

24:39.850 --> 24:41.195
You kidding me.

24:41.630 --> 24:46.924
That watch has sentimental value.
Ah... Stella gave it to me

24:46.968 --> 24:52.306
on our wedding anniversary and
it's very, very important for me

24:52.341 --> 24:54.344
to get it back.

24:54.388 --> 24:56.082
I didn't take your watch.

24:56.126 --> 24:58.599
And I don't want to hear about your wife.

24:58.642 --> 25:03.633
Do you know that we made love
last night in the cellar.

25:03.677 --> 25:07.498
<i>And it was the best sex we had in awhile.</i>

25:07.539 --> 25:08.857
<i>But you know,</i>

25:08.859 --> 25:12.213
I was thinking about when she was
slobbering all over me.

25:12.298 --> 25:13.774
Who?

25:14.919 --> 25:17.091
You stupid, who else?

25:24.077 --> 25:26.681
You know that...

25:29.545 --> 25:30.545
I love you...

25:34.493 --> 25:36.531
I always will.

25:37.357 --> 25:38.443
I mean...

25:40.961 --> 25:44.389
We are like Siamese twins, baby.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.335
And no matter what happens...

25:51.245 --> 25:53.112
we'll always be together.

25:54.284 --> 25:56.801
<i>Ah, you go to the restaurant at 5.</i>

25:57.322 --> 25:58.755
<i>Don't be late.</i>

26:14.772 --> 26:17.070
<i>Lilly? You can come out now.</i>

26:17.114 --> 26:20.064
<i>Yeah, I told you he'll come back!
You don't need to be scared.</i>

26:21.496 --> 26:23.016
<i>See? I'm fine.</i>

26:24.058 --> 26:25.187
<i>Lilly.</i>

26:26.012 --> 26:29.226
<i>I'm have to go now.
You've been a little shit.</i>

26:29.269 --> 26:32.564
<i>You don't come out,
I'm not going to leave you any food.</i>

26:35.603 --> 26:37.210
<i>Fine.</i>

27:57.113 --> 27:59.196
Tell Ludwig to hurry up with that change.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.060
She's good.

28:03.969 --> 28:05.530
The waitress, she's good.

28:06.486 --> 28:08.136
You hear about the ad in the paper?

28:08.874 --> 28:10.523
You should talk to my husband.

28:13.354 --> 28:15.124
Oh! Great catch.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.597
Ah! A new face.

28:19.984 --> 28:23.327
My name is Ludwig.
And you are?

28:23.371 --> 28:24.544
Mia.

28:25.062 --> 28:26.322
Really?

28:26.366 --> 28:28.091
She is here about the ad.

28:28.126 --> 28:30.616
So...
You want to be a waitress?

28:30.651 --> 28:31.651
No.

28:31.703 --> 28:33.483
Well, that's what the ad was for.

28:33.527 --> 28:34.958
I didn't read the ad.

28:35.218 --> 28:36.652
Okay...

28:36.696 --> 28:38.431
Well how can I help you?

28:38.605 --> 28:40.297
You already helped me.

28:40.471 --> 28:42.684
Now returning the favor.

28:42.727 --> 28:43.916
What is all this about?

28:43.951 --> 28:45.349
It's about your husband...

28:45.592 --> 28:48.501
You should rein him in a little
else his prickle get him into trouble.

28:48.545 --> 28:51.235
Especially if he keeps leaving his things

28:51.270 --> 28:53.620
in other women's apartments.

28:53.881 --> 28:55.747
- Not the clock.
- That's...

28:58.524 --> 29:02.432
How much did the little bitch pay you
to do her dirty work?

29:02.467 --> 29:03.559
Mia!

29:03.820 --> 29:05.080
Come here!

29:05.688 --> 29:07.288
Even took a name for the role.

29:07.294 --> 29:09.246
That's very fucking original.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.502
Stella, you see what is going on here,
don't you? I mean...

29:11.546 --> 29:14.106
Mia is upset because
I didn't give her a pay rise.

29:14.150 --> 29:14.997
They set this up.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.191
She stole my watch,
gave it to her friend.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.403
I don't know what's going on.

29:18.750 --> 29:19.879
Really?

29:20.444 --> 29:21.660
Angel...

29:21.703 --> 29:23.005
Don't angel me!

29:23.048 --> 29:24.479
You think I'm stupid?

29:25.348 --> 29:27.951
No, I got to hear it from strangers.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.204
I am done with you.

29:33.203 --> 29:34.071
Don't...

29:34.116 --> 29:35.418
Don't worry about it.

29:38.022 --> 29:39.022
Mia!

29:41.234 --> 29:42.578
My child.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.054
Come here.

29:46.962 --> 29:50.739
How... fucking... dare you.

29:50.869 --> 29:54.992
You low-class piece of shit?

29:55.036 --> 29:59.027
I gave you a fucking job.
I treated you nice.

29:59.062 --> 30:01.197
I kept you working here.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.064
Even after
all the customer complaints!

30:04.107 --> 30:05.279
And this is how you pay me back?

30:05.323 --> 30:06.667
By what?
By stealing my watch.

30:06.710 --> 30:10.530
And sending your friend here to
embarrass me, to... to blackmail me?

30:10.573 --> 30:11.573
Why!

30:13.611 --> 30:14.611
Why?

30:16.432 --> 30:21.120
Do you really think...
that I would choose you over Stella?

30:21.163 --> 30:22.941
And this place?

30:23.115 --> 30:27.326
Do you think that you're so special?

30:31.449 --> 30:32.621
It's over.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.914
Just... leave.

30:41.735 --> 30:42.821
Get out!

30:51.283 --> 30:53.499
I'm sorry.

30:54.972 --> 30:57.448
Drinks for everyone, buddy,
on the house.

30:58.186 --> 30:59.401
Coming right up.

31:03.826 --> 31:07.343
So...
Can I help you with anything else?

31:08.644 --> 31:10.554
That'd be all, thank you.

31:27.610 --> 31:30.085
What the fuck...
What did you do that for?

31:30.128 --> 31:32.214
I have to talk to you,
it's important.

31:32.249 --> 31:33.814
Are you in love with Ludwig?

31:33.849 --> 31:35.380
This isn't about Ludwig!

31:35.415 --> 31:36.415
It is about you.

31:36.422 --> 31:38.723
You don't know shit about me!

31:40.067 --> 31:41.283
When you were in Year 3,

31:41.285 --> 31:43.759
Mary Reilly stabbing you with
a fountain pen right here.

31:43.786 --> 31:45.449
There was blood and ink all over the place.

31:45.711 --> 31:47.359
You still have the scar!

31:47.402 --> 31:48.865
Ludwig loves that scar.

31:48.909 --> 31:50.949
He says it that just hid from the gun shot.

31:51.858 --> 31:53.117
How do you know that?

31:54.781 --> 31:56.846
He'll keep hurting you...

31:57.046 --> 32:01.119
and humiliating you and
dumping you for someone else.

32:01.154 --> 32:03.157
That's okay, it's a fake.

32:04.374 --> 32:06.367
So cool. So handsome. So mature.

32:06.498 --> 32:07.669
So what if he's married?

32:07.713 --> 32:09.450
He treated you like no one else.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.358
And then, you wake up one morning
and he'll be gone.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.573
Just like that.

32:15.615 --> 32:18.325
And the sleeping pills you'll take
should have killed you... and they don't.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.912
This would tell you it's
a miracle you survived.

32:19.954 --> 32:22.123
But you'd just wish that
you were dead.

32:23.079 --> 32:24.555
What're you talking about?

32:25.681 --> 32:27.506
The letters he'll sent you.

32:36.533 --> 32:38.573
He has a way with words.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.654
He never sent me that!

32:41.876 --> 32:42.931
You stay with him, he will.

32:42.975 --> 32:44.347
What you want from me?

32:44.390 --> 32:46.819
I want you to stop
destroy yourself.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.552
Just forget you ever met him.

32:51.550 --> 32:53.446
Get as far away from him as you can.

32:53.448 --> 32:57.019
Because if you stay, you're screwed.

32:57.497 --> 33:01.705
And not just for now,
but for the rest of your life.

33:02.661 --> 33:07.654
And no amount of abortions, doctors
or one-night stands will save you.

33:18.675 --> 33:20.283
Just get your life back.

33:21.455 --> 33:23.624
Please don't waste it.

33:25.491 --> 33:27.489
I should be amended.

33:27.577 --> 33:29.180
I know.

33:41.552 --> 33:43.373
You have to leave
before Stella sees you.

33:43.416 --> 33:46.281
I don't care about Stella.
I have to see him. This is important.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.283
That woman,
I never met her,

33:48.285 --> 33:50.995
but she knows things about me
that nobody knows.

33:50.998 --> 33:53.356
Now listen to me...
He's not here.

33:53.789 --> 33:56.308
I talked to him already.
He knows it's a misunderstanding.

33:56.352 --> 33:59.214
And whoever that woman was,
she has nothing to do with you.

34:00.343 --> 34:01.599
Just go home, Mia.

34:02.078 --> 34:03.555
Go home.

34:09.503 --> 34:11.844
Just been out of service all day.

34:21.697 --> 34:22.824
Lilly!

34:23.694 --> 34:25.561
You must be hungry!

34:25.905 --> 34:28.547
Nobody fed you.
We all forgot about you.

34:28.641 --> 34:29.641
Sorry.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.309
We've to find you something to eat.

34:48.434 --> 34:49.690
Kitty...

34:49.734 --> 34:51.340
Hungry?

35:13.734 --> 35:17.729
You meet someone for the first time,
and...

35:18.681 --> 35:21.548
feels like you known them all your life.

35:23.199 --> 35:27.842
Like...
If always been a part of you,

35:27.886 --> 35:30.359
and you only realized that moment.

35:31.314 --> 35:32.616
Ever felt that?

35:33.440 --> 35:34.655
Never.

35:34.915 --> 35:37.866
Those moments sure make life worth living.

36:38.932 --> 36:39.975
My God!

36:44.359 --> 36:45.574
Oh, my God!

36:48.178 --> 36:49.568
Oh, God!

36:51.478 --> 36:52.478
Come back!

36:58.422 --> 36:59.507
Mia!

37:00.070 --> 37:02.154
<i>Get some help!</i>

37:33.924 --> 37:34.924
Excuse me.

37:35.008 --> 37:36.094
Yes, how can I help?

37:36.137 --> 37:37.897
Can you tell me where
the spare bathroom is, please?

37:37.917 --> 37:39.218
- Over there.
- Thanks.

37:41.086 --> 37:42.086
What're you doing?

37:42.476 --> 37:45.425
I am showing the flat to prospective tenants.
What do you doing?

37:45.644 --> 37:47.553
It's not for rent.
I'm still here.

37:47.588 --> 37:48.335
No, you are not.

37:48.590 --> 37:50.416
You were hit by a car.

37:50.461 --> 37:52.498
You still have further to go.

37:55.929 --> 37:57.102
I'm sorry.

38:10.294 --> 38:11.642
Max!

38:13.463 --> 38:14.550
Max!

38:58.080 --> 38:59.122
C'mon!

39:01.335 --> 39:04.069
Which one you little...

39:08.193 --> 39:10.797
You okay?
Can I help?

39:13.575 --> 39:15.485
I think I'm beyond help.

39:17.134 --> 39:18.610
This is important...

39:18.958 --> 39:21.689
I have to speak with your daughter.
You know where she is?

39:21.733 --> 39:22.733
Mia?

39:23.946 --> 39:25.901
She's always running around.

39:26.595 --> 39:28.636
Ever since her dad died,

39:28.677 --> 39:32.412
she makes up any excuse not to
spend any time at home with me.

39:33.410 --> 39:35.275
Even on her birthday.

39:35.838 --> 39:37.402
Is her birthday.

39:38.183 --> 39:40.441
She's turning 18.

39:41.829 --> 39:42.916
Why?

39:42.960 --> 39:44.303
Do you know my daughter?

39:44.347 --> 39:45.474
I have to go.

39:47.991 --> 39:48.686
<i>Why?</i>

39:48.859 --> 39:50.509
<i>What you want from her?</i>

39:58.495 --> 40:06.135
$200, $600, $650...
$700...

40:11.299 --> 40:13.599
Mia dear,
help Buddy with the tables.

40:13.643 --> 40:14.831
When you're done,
you can go home.

40:15.005 --> 40:15.857
Okay.

40:19.501 --> 40:20.848
How do we do tonight?

40:20.891 --> 40:24.275
Well, we broke even.
I'm so closing up early.

40:25.362 --> 40:26.923
We should let Mia go.

40:26.967 --> 40:29.312
Buddy can handle things on his own.

40:29.354 --> 40:32.347
No,
we need somebody to open up early.

40:35.823 --> 40:37.600
Can't believe that's him.

40:37.947 --> 40:39.901
It looks so sad now.

40:40.335 --> 40:42.375
You should see him with his band.

40:42.418 --> 40:44.285
He lit up this place.

40:44.633 --> 40:46.368
Queues around the block.

40:46.411 --> 40:48.539
Well, you probably weren't even born then.

40:48.973 --> 40:50.882
Why doesn't he play anymore?

40:50.925 --> 40:53.964
Stella found him with a needle
stuck in his arm... again.

40:54.399 --> 40:57.956
And he can't face the crowds
without the drugs, and...

40:57.991 --> 40:59.876
She made him stop.

40:59.911 --> 41:02.948
So asterisk that mean:
No drugs, no trumpet.

41:02.992 --> 41:05.117
No wonder he's so unhappy.

41:05.551 --> 41:07.375
Time to go home.

41:19.570 --> 41:20.308
Good night.

41:20.438 --> 41:21.741
- Good night.
- Good night, Buddy.

41:21.785 --> 41:23.045
- Bye.
- Good night Mia.

41:26.256 --> 41:27.470
She's pretty.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.420
She's young enough to be my daughter.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.761
Besides, I only got eyes for you.
You know that.

41:34.805 --> 41:37.062
I was just teasing you.

41:41.184 --> 41:43.874
You, um... Go home, relax.
I will lock up.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.177
Don't stay too long.

41:45.221 --> 41:47.349
I hate watching tele by myself.

42:27.668 --> 42:29.014
Forgot something?

42:29.493 --> 42:31.878
I... I think I left my handbag.

42:39.951 --> 42:40.951
Thanks.

42:41.730 --> 42:43.467
What was your birthday wish?

42:43.815 --> 42:45.768
How did you know?

42:45.939 --> 42:47.242
Buddy told me.

42:47.762 --> 42:49.717
Buddy has a big mouth.

42:52.278 --> 42:54.492
Well, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

42:55.792 --> 42:56.878
Okay...

42:58.570 --> 43:03.389
My birthday wish...
is to hear you play the trumpet.

43:06.339 --> 43:07.599
I love jazz.

43:10.158 --> 43:11.720
I don't play anymore.

43:16.105 --> 43:18.581
If I don't play,
you'll be disappointed.

45:44.538 --> 45:45.905
You can't go up.
You know that.

45:45.940 --> 45:47.273
What was I supposed to do?

45:48.098 --> 45:50.225
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

45:50.702 --> 45:53.003
Help me, please!

45:56.128 --> 45:57.430
Take me there.

46:19.696 --> 46:21.135
Ah, morning, Max.

46:21.170 --> 46:22.992
- Morning, Doug.
- You look well.

46:23.036 --> 46:24.251
So do you.

46:25.771 --> 46:27.637
Where're you off to today?

46:27.680 --> 46:29.938
We're going to the park
to see the clown.

46:29.981 --> 46:31.641
The clown in the park?

46:31.676 --> 46:34.226
They had someone play in the park
last week, and...

46:34.230 --> 46:36.318
She thinks they'll be there again today.

46:36.353 --> 46:38.096
It's my birthday tomorrow.

46:38.131 --> 46:39.529
Yes, I know.

46:39.573 --> 46:43.002
Happy birthday
for tomorrow, Mia.

46:43.045 --> 46:44.521
How old will you be?

46:44.565 --> 46:45.650
I'll be 10.

46:45.693 --> 46:46.908
How old do you?

46:46.951 --> 46:48.208
You know I'm very old.

46:48.250 --> 46:50.466
500 years old.

46:51.593 --> 46:53.461
I'm too old for lollipops.

46:53.496 --> 46:54.591
What do you say?

46:55.633 --> 46:56.890
Thank you.

46:57.281 --> 47:00.494
Would you...
take a picture of us?

47:00.538 --> 47:01.837
Doug!

47:02.835 --> 47:04.224
Why don't you take it?

47:13.556 --> 47:14.684
Ready?

47:17.722 --> 47:18.678
Thank you.

47:18.721 --> 47:20.281
Happy birthday.

47:21.975 --> 47:23.062
See you!

47:42.461 --> 47:44.848
Hello, birthday girl.
We meet again.

47:47.714 --> 47:49.667
You got a lovely balloon...

47:49.710 --> 47:51.495
from this clown trying to play notes.

47:51.497 --> 47:54.614
So, see you all tomorrow,
next day or whenever.

47:57.567 --> 47:59.474
See you all again.

48:02.515 --> 48:04.728
I want to hear the song
you played last week.

48:04.771 --> 48:07.290
Go to packing up, my little girl.
Sorry.

48:07.855 --> 48:09.024
Please.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.238
No, tomorrow, alright?

48:13.234 --> 48:14.754
Do you have any money?

48:17.402 --> 48:19.701
Five. That should be enough.

48:23.434 --> 48:26.429
Alright. Consider it a favor.

48:33.328 --> 48:35.327
No, the real song.

48:35.674 --> 48:37.496
"Real song"?

48:37.540 --> 48:39.450
Ho... ho...
I like that.

48:39.494 --> 48:42.357
A real song for the nice real girl.

49:07.227 --> 49:08.745
Mia, we need to leave.

49:09.223 --> 49:10.915
We have to leave right now.

49:10.957 --> 49:12.912
You need to get away from the clown.

49:12.955 --> 49:13.616
Hey!

49:13.651 --> 49:15.257
- C'mon!
- I want to watch him!

49:15.603 --> 49:17.383
- What the fuck you think you're doing?
- Sorry.

49:17.427 --> 49:19.468
- Dad!
- One second, sweetheart.

49:19.512 --> 49:22.330
Thanks.
Trying to get me away from that trumpet.

49:23.372 --> 49:25.237
I want the clown in my party.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.886
You don't want him in the party, darling.
He's just a trump.

49:27.930 --> 49:29.710
I want her to come too!

49:29.754 --> 49:30.663
Whatever!

49:30.706 --> 49:33.008
You deal with it, Doug.
I'm going home.

49:33.225 --> 49:37.520
Ah... You... You go with mommy, sweetheart.
I... I'll sort things out, I promise.

49:41.210 --> 49:44.986
Look, my daughter would like you
to come to her birthday party tomorrow.

49:45.203 --> 49:49.499
Just for an hour.
It's the corner building, Flat 4-D.

49:50.150 --> 49:53.497
- Say, one o'clock?
- Um...

49:54.621 --> 49:57.704
£80, plus food and drink.

49:57.747 --> 49:59.959
£40, plus food. No drink.

50:00.002 --> 50:02.129
It's a children's party.

50:02.911 --> 50:04.473
Done.

50:06.558 --> 50:09.508
You are welcome to come too
if... if you like.

50:10.637 --> 50:12.548
Yeah.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.266
You must be a fan.

50:23.658 --> 50:25.089
Do you want my autograph?

50:25.349 --> 50:26.826
Do you want to shake my hand?

50:26.868 --> 50:28.778
I need to talk to you.

50:30.081 --> 50:31.558
Okay.

50:31.701 --> 50:36.345
Um...
You want to join me for a drink?

50:36.679 --> 50:38.110
I mean... I am buying.

50:38.675 --> 50:40.541
Look at all that dough.

50:41.625 --> 50:44.165
I am rich.
Huh, huh.

50:44.490 --> 50:45.968
I know just the place.

50:48.441 --> 50:50.220
There you are, mate.
Keep the change.

50:50.263 --> 50:51.304
Thank you, mate.

51:17.649 --> 51:19.038
Angel, Angel...

51:19.080 --> 51:20.123
Bring me that hand.

51:20.166 --> 51:22.684
God, Ludwig.
Is that you?

51:23.377 --> 51:24.681
Do I look that bad?

51:25.376 --> 51:27.163
Thank you very much.

51:27.198 --> 51:29.498
Can I get a bottle of
something for me, and...

51:30.280 --> 51:31.711
I don't know your name.

51:31.746 --> 51:33.232
I don't have one.

51:33.275 --> 51:34.795
A bottle of whiskey for me.

51:34.838 --> 51:36.572
And the little lady,
we know 'em.

51:36.616 --> 51:39.525
Don't you have any pride?
Look what you are doing to yourself.

51:39.873 --> 51:43.691
Stella, look, I am so loaded.

51:44.212 --> 51:45.902
Buddy, Buddy!

51:46.337 --> 51:48.595
Can you vouch for me, please.

51:48.638 --> 51:50.981
- C'mon.
- It's Stella's place, Ludwig.

51:51.459 --> 51:53.153
I do what she says.

52:34.773 --> 52:36.120
Come work for me.

52:36.684 --> 52:39.547
You have a roof over you ready
and a stage to play on.

52:44.323 --> 52:45.886
Stella...

52:47.924 --> 52:49.747
Just one drink, please.

52:49.782 --> 52:51.571
No. It's for your own good.

52:52.006 --> 52:54.176
She's right. C'mon, let's go.

52:59.427 --> 53:01.293
Change your mind,
you know where to find me.

53:07.671 --> 53:08.975
Still like me, yeah?

53:11.839 --> 53:13.228
Alright Ludwig.

53:14.486 --> 53:15.876
Oh, where are you going?

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
Back.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.002
Get in.

53:18.740 --> 53:21.213
C'mon, girls.

53:21.648 --> 53:22.907
Where is my money?

53:24.600 --> 53:26.249
You see...

53:26.900 --> 53:28.940
I went inside looking for you.

53:28.983 --> 53:31.153
Oh yeah?
Why you run then?

53:31.188 --> 53:33.323
Well, because I thought
you were someone else.

53:33.368 --> 53:34.930
So I follow you and Mia.

53:34.974 --> 53:36.405
£25!

53:36.666 --> 53:39.834
You owe me £500,
you goat-face mother fucker.

53:40.744 --> 53:43.609
You gonna fuck me at £475.

53:43.914 --> 53:45.952
You touch me and
I'll scotch your eyes out!

53:45.996 --> 53:47.048
I might just like it.

53:47.083 --> 53:48.167
Okay, leave her alone.
Leave her alone.

53:48.211 --> 53:49.253
I'll get you your money.

53:49.297 --> 53:51.422
Oh, yeah?
I want it now.

53:51.769 --> 53:53.158
- Err!
- Get off!

53:57.412 --> 53:59.236
Good, good.

53:59.754 --> 54:01.412
Take this.
It was a present from Dessi.

54:01.447 --> 54:04.267
He... I mean, he used to
blow the roof off with Bruno with that.

54:04.302 --> 54:05.831
Ask anybody, it's...

54:05.874 --> 54:08.047
Worth a 100 times
more than what I owe you.

54:08.263 --> 54:12.559
Now these things are of value.
My aunt sold a piano for £2,000.

54:15.337 --> 54:19.242
This is your lucky day.
Now fuck off out of my car.

54:22.412 --> 54:24.321
You don't learn, do you?

54:24.364 --> 54:27.489
You lost everything!
You hit the bottom.

54:27.533 --> 54:29.831
I'm always at the bottom
of a bottomless pad.

54:31.134 --> 54:32.159
Leave London.

54:32.161 --> 54:34.434
There is nothing left for you here anymore.
Look at you.

54:34.476 --> 54:36.735
Sure, go to Montana,
live on a ranch,

54:36.770 --> 54:38.687
walk off the fire and I'll
breed rabbits.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.380
That's good.
Go to America.

54:40.641 --> 54:41.706
Hey, you know what?

54:41.708 --> 54:45.393
My dad, he lives in New Orleans,
or Charlotte, or... somewhere like that.

54:45.396 --> 54:48.062
I could go and see him, because I
haven't seen him for a while.

54:48.625 --> 54:50.449
Why don't you go and see him.

54:51.231 --> 54:54.311
Stay with him for a few years
while you get back on your feet.

54:54.355 --> 54:55.881
You never know,
you might like it.

54:55.916 --> 54:57.303
You have all worked out for me,
haven't you?

54:57.347 --> 54:58.910
You need a new start.

54:59.172 --> 55:01.992
Somewhere far away
where nobody knows you.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.425
Look, I got money.

55:05.553 --> 55:07.765
Enough to tie you over for awhile.

55:07.809 --> 55:09.764
But you have to leave!

55:11.975 --> 55:14.362
Thank you so much!

55:15.449 --> 55:17.314
You're my guardian angel.

55:17.357 --> 55:19.009
My savior!

55:20.398 --> 55:21.914
I'll never forget you.

55:29.035 --> 55:30.728
I hope to God you will.

55:41.924 --> 55:45.481
<i>Good day. Ah, this is...</i>
[On the radio]

55:46.654 --> 55:49.563
Why didn't the skeleton cross the road?

55:50.951 --> 55:53.295
Because he didn't have the guts to do.

55:54.336 --> 56:00.456
Because he was a... a skeleton,
he didn't have the... the... the guts.

56:16.472 --> 56:18.425
Ah, there's someone at the door.

56:25.715 --> 56:28.495
Arr, I'm glad you made it!

56:28.667 --> 56:30.969
I'm sorry
I don't even know your name.

56:31.229 --> 56:33.315
- Mia.
- Mia?

56:33.877 --> 56:35.786
- Ah, what a coincidence!
- Here.

56:36.870 --> 56:38.606
You met my wife Doris?

56:38.649 --> 56:40.950
What a wonderful housekeeper!

56:40.995 --> 56:43.162
Her kitchen is spotless.

56:44.509 --> 56:45.812
It's a photograph!

56:45.856 --> 56:48.068
Hah...
Look honey!

56:48.199 --> 56:50.498
Wait a minute. Didn't you...
just take this yesterday?

56:50.533 --> 56:51.665
With our camera.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.797
I mean...
How did you...?

56:52.927 --> 56:54.144
It's my secret, Doug.

56:55.013 --> 56:56.880
I wanted it to be a special present.

56:58.007 --> 56:59.658
Oh, splendid!

57:00.873 --> 57:03.606
I'm going to hang it right here.

57:10.507 --> 57:12.026
Let me help you in the kitchen!

57:12.373 --> 57:13.415
With what?

57:13.459 --> 57:15.151
With, whatever you're doing.

57:15.585 --> 57:17.364
Mia, go play with your friends.

57:22.659 --> 57:23.788
Where do you live?

57:23.832 --> 57:25.700
I never seen you in this building before.

57:26.264 --> 57:27.782
I live upstairs.

57:27.825 --> 57:29.475
Hope I'm not intruding.

57:29.516 --> 57:30.820
That's alright.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.772
Can help put the candles on the cake.

57:45.187 --> 57:46.922
Is everything okay?

57:47.834 --> 57:49.223
You don't seem happy.

57:50.828 --> 57:53.433
Really?
Whatever gave you that idea?

57:54.430 --> 57:57.208
My husband is imbecile,
my daughter is a selfish little brat.

57:57.251 --> 58:00.550
And there's never enough wine in the house.
Why in the world would I be unhappy?

58:03.719 --> 58:05.105
Plus me, right?

58:05.322 --> 58:08.188
I need to see the beauty
of the world around me.

58:08.753 --> 58:12.007
Enjoy every moment
as if it were my last.

58:13.311 --> 58:15.349
Maybe go see a doctor.

58:17.348 --> 58:18.909
Guess what? I did.

58:19.949 --> 58:21.557
Nobody told me...

58:22.251 --> 58:25.895
The key to happiness in life
is not having what you want.

58:26.417 --> 58:28.676
But wanting what you have.

58:30.932 --> 58:33.879
I told him to go fuck himself
and give me my money back.

58:37.223 --> 58:38.310
Mia!

58:39.654 --> 58:42.521
Cake's ready.
Come blow your candles out.

58:44.906 --> 58:45.601
Mia!

58:45.688 --> 58:48.032
Okay, I'll go.

58:48.378 --> 58:49.378
Okay?

58:51.851 --> 58:53.326
Chimpanzee.

58:53.369 --> 58:55.627
Chimpanzee, very good, very good.

58:56.670 --> 58:58.143
Elephant.

58:58.185 --> 59:00.139
<i>Elephant.
Thank you. Very good.</i>

59:01.312 --> 59:02.742
You okay, sweetie?

59:02.961 --> 59:04.915
I hate these kids stuff.

59:10.166 --> 59:11.948
Is Mia really your name?

59:11.990 --> 59:13.509
Yeah. Why?

59:13.552 --> 59:15.722
Because I'm the only Mia in the world.

59:16.721 --> 59:18.629
I used to think that.

59:18.672 --> 59:20.584
But now I know I'm not alone.

59:21.670 --> 59:23.541
Do you know what "Mia" means?

59:23.576 --> 59:25.660
Is Latin for "Star of the Sea".

59:26.226 --> 59:28.264
Your dad told you that,
didn't he?

59:28.524 --> 59:29.827
How do you know?

59:29.871 --> 59:32.127
Because my dad told me the same thing.

59:33.125 --> 59:35.037
What else do you know about me?

59:39.246 --> 59:41.112
Will I ever go to India?

59:41.154 --> 59:42.545
Let's see...

59:43.700 --> 59:48.162
You'll go to India...
Hah...

59:48.533 --> 59:50.975
Egypt...
China.

59:51.177 --> 59:54.133
You'll go all around the world!

59:54.263 --> 59:56.912
China...
<i>Wow.</i>

59:57.909 --> 01:00:01.249
You will live a long life.

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.680
You'll meet a good man...

01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:07.414
who love you and treat you right.

01:00:08.239 --> 01:00:09.930
And you will be happy.

01:00:14.054 --> 01:00:15.832
C'mon,
your friends are waiting.

01:00:20.172 --> 01:00:21.606
<i>Give me those.</i>

01:00:25.945 --> 01:00:27.117
<i>Yay!</i>

01:00:27.161 --> 01:00:29.720
Happy birthday, little girl!

01:00:30.676 --> 01:00:32.935
I couldn't miss a birthday party,
could I?

01:00:32.978 --> 01:00:34.669
I made a commitment.

01:00:34.712 --> 01:00:36.232
You know.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.274
You want some wine, clown?

01:00:38.317 --> 01:00:39.660
Ah, wine!

01:00:39.704 --> 01:00:42.655
I love some wine.
Thank you very much.

01:00:42.699 --> 01:00:44.173
I'm thirsty.

01:00:44.217 --> 01:00:45.824
Thank you, you Missy.

01:00:49.339 --> 01:00:51.726
You're to blow out your candles
or you want me to do it?

01:00:55.763 --> 01:00:58.453
<i>- Yeah!
- Yay!</i>

01:00:59.538 --> 01:01:00.971
I'll... cut the cake.

01:01:01.797 --> 01:01:04.445
Yeah, you go cut the cake.

01:01:04.792 --> 01:01:06.700
Missy.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.913
Right, now...

01:01:09.477 --> 01:01:13.864
Attention, sea-men and sea-women.

01:01:13.964 --> 01:01:16.544
We are in nuclear submarine

01:01:16.644 --> 01:01:18.765
and the belly of a white whale

01:01:19.198 --> 01:01:21.588
in the middle of the English Channel.

01:01:21.632 --> 01:01:25.190
Our job is to go and...

01:01:25.234 --> 01:01:29.132
park our warship
just off the coast of France.

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.136
There, you can be the captain.

01:01:31.179 --> 01:01:32.663
Take a 3 steps forward.

01:01:32.698 --> 01:01:34.468
- Yeah!
- C'mon now, chip chop.

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.979
1, 2, 3. Left-right, left-right,
left-right. Arr, arr, arr.

01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:39.643
Now, you can be the navigator.

01:01:39.686 --> 01:01:42.288
Take 4 ease steps forward.

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:45.520
C'mon, miss.
Everyone's waiting.

01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:47.627
Yeah, c'mon, miss.
Everyone's waiting.

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.973
Are you disobeying my orders,
sailor?

01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:52.028
Chip chop. Left-right,
left-right, left-right...

01:01:52.128 --> 01:01:54.078
left-right. That's it,
that's it, that's it.

01:01:54.113 --> 01:01:57.914
Alright, you can be in charge of
the nuclear warhead.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.527
Take 2 steps forward.

01:02:00.562 --> 01:02:03.904
Left-right, left-right, left-right,
left-right. Right now, then...

01:02:04.382 --> 01:02:08.027
Unfortunately, we ran out of electrical
apparently during the storm

01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:10.067
and we gonna have to rely on candles.

01:02:10.672 --> 01:02:12.279
I don't have any candles?

01:02:12.279 --> 01:02:14.024
So, I'm gonna have to go and get some.

01:02:14.026 --> 01:02:16.961
But you lot, right...
you stay here until I come back.

01:02:16.962 --> 01:02:19.270
And now that's an order.
Do you understand?

01:02:19.312 --> 01:02:20.484
- Yes!
- Yes sir!

01:02:20.526 --> 01:02:25.691
- Alright.
- Left-right, left-right...

01:02:28.253 --> 01:02:31.942
Just checking.
Arr!

01:02:32.984 --> 01:02:35.587
<i>Well then, excuse me...</i>

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.894
<i>First of all...
reflection on you, so...</i>

01:02:44.936 --> 01:02:46.482
<i>Attention...</i>

01:02:50.344 --> 01:02:52.125
Ta-da!

01:02:54.077 --> 01:02:58.590
I'm dying for a dance.
How about you?

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:14.431
<i>Now, attention!</i>

01:03:20.206 --> 01:03:21.292
Come here.

01:03:22.808 --> 01:03:27.149
We haven't done this
for a long while,

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:28.806
you know?

01:03:28.841 --> 01:03:31.142
Shut up and kiss me, clown.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.351
Wait mate!

01:03:41.386 --> 01:03:44.207
There might be a leak in the ship.

01:03:44.469 --> 01:03:48.026
And that
if there is a leak in the ship...

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:50.457
<i>and we will...</i>

01:03:51.844 --> 01:03:54.840
Let's have a look and see
if we can find that leak.

01:03:59.397 --> 01:04:00.785
Come on, everybody!

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:15.981
Dougie!

01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:32.165
You just go to stand there,
Doug?

01:04:33.598 --> 01:04:34.598
Doug!

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:36.940
What am I supposed to do?

01:04:36.983 --> 01:04:38.049
Look, empower.

01:04:38.351 --> 01:04:40.718
Throw him out of the house.
Do something!

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.321
How dare you boss my husband around!

01:04:45.316 --> 01:04:47.140
We're just talking, Doug.

01:04:47.749 --> 01:04:48.841
Go ahead.

01:04:48.876 --> 01:04:49.945
Maybe I should just go.

01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:51.523
Look, give me the money
and I'll be on my way.

01:04:51.565 --> 01:04:53.172
No, the party's not over yet.

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:55.862
It's £40, right?

01:04:56.514 --> 01:04:57.514
Yeah.

01:04:57.816 --> 01:04:59.117
Just a minute.

01:05:02.158 --> 01:05:04.891
Let's have some fun.
It's Mia's birthday.

01:05:10.137 --> 01:05:12.574
Hey! Dougie, c'mon.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.612
Peace, I will.

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.840
Oh!

01:05:18.561 --> 01:05:20.646
What did you doing, Doug?

01:05:22.121 --> 01:05:24.985
I thought I told you to get rid of that
long time ago.

01:05:25.028 --> 01:05:27.374
Dougie, there is no need for all this.
Just talk about it.

01:05:27.415 --> 01:05:29.430
Look, I eat the £40
if that'll makes you happy.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.530
I'll just leave.

01:05:31.313 --> 01:05:33.101
- Ah!!!
- Ow!  - God!

01:05:33.145 --> 01:05:35.619
What are you doing!

01:05:36.575 --> 01:05:37.876
I didn't know it still worked.

01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:52.501
It's okay.
Give me the gun.

01:05:59.318 --> 01:06:01.746
You knew the clown from before,
didn't you?

01:06:03.743 --> 01:06:04.881
Didn't you!

01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:08.127
Get out of my house!

01:06:14.854 --> 01:06:16.242
The clown left.

01:06:16.285 --> 01:06:17.849
Don't worry about the clown.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:22.320
You need to come with me, okay?

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:25.140
You just leave that there
and we'll get your coat.

01:06:25.487 --> 01:06:26.876
Okay, Mia.

01:06:27.963 --> 01:06:29.957
You stay with me, okay?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.131
Come here!

01:06:32.919 --> 01:06:33.648
You okay?

01:06:37.553 --> 01:06:38.553
C'mon!

01:06:38.812 --> 01:06:41.156
Max,
take me down!

01:06:42.154 --> 01:06:44.194
The police are after me.

01:06:44.843 --> 01:06:46.372
Please!

01:06:46.407 --> 01:06:47.797
How far down?

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.970
All the way.

01:06:49.013 --> 01:06:50.661
Well, this is it.

01:06:52.094 --> 01:06:53.960
This is your last trip.

01:06:56.131 --> 01:06:57.997
<i>Your last chance Mia.</i>

01:07:13.188 --> 01:07:14.965
<i>...all that stuff.</i>

01:07:15.009 --> 01:07:16.267
<i>They need to know.</i>

01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:19.479
<i>That's not really the problem. It's...
I can't see where I'm going.</i>

01:07:19.523 --> 01:07:20.723
<i>How many steps left?</i>

01:07:20.825 --> 01:07:23.385
<i>Four. Four more steps.
C'mon, keep going.</i>

01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:27.899
- Doug!
- I'm so sorry, miss!

01:07:27.934 --> 01:07:29.853
I... I didn't see you coming.
I'm so sorry!

01:07:29.996 --> 01:07:30.996
Are you hurt?

01:07:31.133 --> 01:07:33.238
Please come inside.
You must sit down for a minute.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.061
It's nothing. I'm fine.

01:07:35.103 --> 01:07:35.925
No, please, come inside.

01:07:36.026 --> 01:07:37.447
We'll make sure you're alright.

01:07:37.491 --> 01:07:38.879
Doug!

01:07:38.923 --> 01:07:41.442
- A scratch!
- Come in.

01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:44.783
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

01:07:46.433 --> 01:07:49.341
I'm Doug Selva.

01:07:49.514 --> 01:07:53.899
And that beautiful woman
is my wife...

01:07:53.943 --> 01:07:55.025
Doris.

01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:56.501
Welcome to our home!

01:07:56.543 --> 01:07:58.063
This is terrible.

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:00.494
We haven't even moved in yet,
we already have an accident.

01:08:00.638 --> 01:08:02.751
Don't be negative, sweetheart.
Accidents happen.

01:08:02.795 --> 01:08:04.461
You must have a headache.

01:08:04.504 --> 01:08:06.526
I got some Paracetamol
in one of these boxes.

01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:07.651
I should probably go.

01:08:07.655 --> 01:08:10.434
You, are not going anywhere.

01:08:10.781 --> 01:08:12.640
You need a little rest and...

01:08:12.642 --> 01:08:14.124
and then we are going to
have dinner together.

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:17.335
We ran into you.
And now we got to put things right.

01:08:17.379 --> 01:08:18.948
That's the law.

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:22.412
Doug,
we don't even have a table or chairs.

01:08:22.455 --> 01:08:23.715
Then we will eat out.

01:08:23.932 --> 01:08:25.970
I'm going to get the rest of our things.

01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:30.615
Do you have a name for her?

01:08:31.179 --> 01:08:33.957
We want a boy.
Little Dougie.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.863
You are going to have a girl,
Doris.

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:39.209
You're psychic or something?

01:08:39.252 --> 01:08:41.032
How are we holding?

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:46.961
Here we all are,
carry on like we're best friends.

01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:49.040
And...
We don't even know your name.

01:08:49.062 --> 01:08:50.102
Mia.

01:08:51.187 --> 01:08:53.055
Exotic!

01:08:54.615 --> 01:08:56.004
What you think, Doris?

01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.264
Beautiful name for a baby girl.

01:09:00.691 --> 01:09:03.645
That's Doug for you.
In and out.

01:09:04.381 --> 01:09:06.249
- You want some weed?
- What?

01:09:06.466 --> 01:09:08.506
Do you want some weed?

01:09:10.413 --> 01:09:12.020
Are you serious?

01:09:13.538 --> 01:09:14.971
I don't think you should.

01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:16.707
Please!

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:19.095
Pregnant women smoke and drink
in France all the time.

01:09:19.138 --> 01:09:21.439
Their kids have no problem
speaking French.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:29.554
No, thanks.

01:09:35.764 --> 01:09:37.714
Have had that picture of him?

01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:40.014
How much you know him?

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.488
How well you said
you would know anybody?

01:09:43.791 --> 01:09:45.831
That's it, my love!

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:50.386
We are now officially moved in.

01:09:50.996 --> 01:09:54.163
So, fish and chips or curry.
You choose.

01:09:54.382 --> 01:09:55.597
We're going to Harmony.

01:09:55.641 --> 01:09:57.679
Mia wants to see Ludwig play.

01:09:57.723 --> 01:09:59.287
- No, I...
- Yes!

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:01.285
You don't know what you missing,
otherwise.

01:10:01.328 --> 01:10:04.017
Doris,
baby...

01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:06.882
Thursday night!

01:10:06.924 --> 01:10:09.096
It will be a nice crowd there.

01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:10.355
We'll have fun.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.825
We haven't been there for months.
Please!

01:10:13.868 --> 01:10:16.197
What is it about a skinny white smagget

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.510
blowing into a twisted steel pipe
that drives women crazy?

01:10:20.553 --> 01:10:21.553
He's the devil!

01:10:21.636 --> 01:10:23.982
Thank you!
That's what I say.

01:10:24.026 --> 01:10:25.338
She means it in a good way.

01:10:25.373 --> 01:10:26.230
Doug's right.

01:10:26.232 --> 01:10:28.801
Maybe it's not the best thing
for you now, in your condition.

01:10:28.843 --> 01:10:30.320
I need a break.

01:10:30.363 --> 01:10:31.838
Please Dougie.

01:10:31.882 --> 01:10:33.618
You can go another time.

01:10:33.722 --> 01:10:36.672
Another time I'll be
breastfeeding and changing nappies.

01:10:36.907 --> 01:10:38.652
Please baby!

01:10:39.434 --> 01:10:42.044
All I wanted to do is listen to the music.

01:10:42.079 --> 01:10:46.072
That's why I dedicate
this piece to my muse.

01:10:46.116 --> 01:10:49.677
My one, and my only.

01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:54.494
Luckily, she is in the audience tonight.

01:12:25.899 --> 01:12:27.244
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

01:12:28.806 --> 01:12:29.934
Thank you!

01:12:30.499 --> 01:12:34.666
I need a drink.
When I shall return.

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:42.043
Brandy and milk?

01:12:42.087 --> 01:12:43.477
That's my girl!

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.671
Ludwig?

01:12:56.582 --> 01:12:57.842
Ludwig, I...

01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:03.267
I've been waiting for you to call me.
You promised.

01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:05.293
I need to tell you something.

01:13:05.365 --> 01:13:08.867
Hold on,
it looks so beautifully huge.

01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:12.166
Good job, Dougie my man.
Good job.

01:13:14.638 --> 01:13:17.851
Ludwig, I...

01:13:21.801 --> 01:13:23.320
I love you.

01:13:36.035 --> 01:13:40.159
What about all the drummers
and bass players that you fucked.

01:13:40.852 --> 01:13:42.934
Did you tell them that too?

01:13:44.325 --> 01:13:46.713
How can you be so cruel?

01:13:48.003 --> 01:13:49.403
Ludwig...

01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:54.263
Come darling...
Let's... Let's go home.

01:13:59.471 --> 01:14:02.431
I think the baby's coming!

01:14:02.466 --> 01:14:04.346
- The water broke, call a cab.
- Oh God!

01:14:04.377 --> 01:14:06.808
Buddy, go get a cab.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.630

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.378
Came to say goodbye,
Ludwig.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.810
Goodbye?

01:16:33.852 --> 01:16:36.023
- Do I know you?
- No.

01:16:36.585 --> 01:16:38.626
That's how I like it.

01:16:39.148 --> 01:16:41.534
That's how it's going to stay
because I know you.

01:16:42.011 --> 01:16:45.007
I know who you are.
I know everything about you.

01:16:46.482 --> 01:16:47.828
Can I at least have your name?

01:16:47.959 --> 01:16:50.822
You won't need it
because you'll never know me.

01:16:51.604 --> 01:16:54.816
You never came near me.
You're gone.

01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:58.071
- Out of my life.
- Not so fast.

01:16:59.113 --> 01:17:02.671
I have a feeling
that this is just the beginning.

01:17:02.931 --> 01:17:04.148
Let go of me!

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:08.834
No one says "Goodbye" to me,
sweetheart.

01:17:09.788 --> 01:17:11.048
No one.

01:17:12.525 --> 01:17:13.828
Let go of me!

01:17:21.726 --> 01:17:24.072
That was unnecessary.

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:34.310
<i>Somebody call the police!</i>

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.856
It's okay, Mia.

01:18:13.678 --> 01:18:14.985
Don't cry.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.331
Shhh.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.148
You'll be fine.

01:18:20.353 --> 01:18:22.353
Shhh.

01:18:22.486 --> 01:18:25.222
Aw...
Is okay, is okay.

01:18:38.764 --> 01:18:40.415
That old woman...

01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:42.984
What old woman?

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:45.667
The one who didn't
have any family or friends.

01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:49.614
Who hardly went out.
Kept forgetting her keys, her name.

01:18:49.961 --> 01:18:52.218
You lost me. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:56.341
Have you kept the box?

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:58.339
Yes, of course, I have.

01:19:01.591 --> 01:19:03.503
Have you decided
what you're going to do with it?

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.154
Yeah!

01:19:05.804 --> 01:19:08.669
Well, I better get back to the lift.

01:19:17.216 --> 01:19:19.476
<i>I'm good at love,
I'm good at hate.</i>

01:19:19.562 --> 01:19:21.384
<i>It's in-between I freeze.</i>

01:19:21.689 --> 01:19:23.990
<i>Been working out,
But it's too late.</i>

01:19:24.034 --> 01:19:26.375
<i>It's been too late for years.</i>

01:19:26.593 --> 01:19:28.807
<i>But you look fine,
You really do.</i>

01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:31.019
<i>The pride of Boogie Street.</i>

01:19:31.193 --> 01:19:33.668
<i>Somebody must have died for you.</i>

01:19:33.929 --> 01:19:36.185
<i>A thousand kisses deep.</i>

01:20:13.465 --> 01:20:15.854
<i>And sometimes when the night is slow,</i>

01:20:16.027 --> 01:20:18.153
<i>The wretched and the meek,</i>

01:20:18.197 --> 01:20:20.844
<i>We gather up our hearts and go.</i>

01:20:20.974 --> 01:20:23.232
<i>A thousand kisses deep.</i>

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:27.181
<i>And fragrant is the thought of you,</i>.

01:20:27.443 --> 01:20:29.742
<i>The file on you complete--</i>

01:20:30.307 --> 01:20:32.650
<i>Except what we forgot to do.</i>

01:20:33.085 --> 01:20:36.036
<i>A thousand kisses deep.</i>

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
In Memory of Ida Klaff
1922-2010
"Thank you for the visit"
