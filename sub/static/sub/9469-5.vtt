00:21.132 --> 00:24.177
- Sausage?
- Vegan.

00:25.688 --> 00:28.866
Since I was 15, I haven't
eaten anything with a face.

00:31.142 --> 00:34.437
- So...
- So?

00:34.521 --> 00:38.399
Uh, the baby... the one upstairs?

00:38.525 --> 00:41.778
- Right.
- ... has been bothering me.

00:41.862 --> 00:45.573
Not the baby per se, more
like the entire situation.

00:45.657 --> 00:49.202
I mean, it is pretty fucking weird
when you get right down to it.

00:50.077 --> 00:54.165
Did I make a wrong turn through a wormhole
into some fucked-up Victorian novel...

00:54.248 --> 00:56.459
[voice echoing] ... where a top
secret baby is being cared for...

00:56.584 --> 00:57.752
- [heart beating]
- ... by a demonic she-servant

00:57.836 --> 00:59.671
- and her brain-dead sidekick Lurch?
- [kettle whistling]

00:59.754 --> 01:03.341
I mean, where did you even find those
two, open-mic night at the mortuary?

01:03.424 --> 01:06.344
Seriously, Roman, what's
the deal with the kid?

01:06.427 --> 01:08.054
Roman?

01:08.137 --> 01:09.430
[shrieks]

01:09.848 --> 01:12.225
[screaming]

01:14.019 --> 01:17.605
[French pop song playing]

02:05.862 --> 02:07.447
Are you going to talk
to me about any of this

02:07.530 --> 02:09.115
or should I just go fuck myself?

02:09.198 --> 02:10.741
[kettle whistling fades]

02:10.824 --> 02:13.828
Did you hear anything I just said?

02:13.912 --> 02:16.497
Yeah. You're a vegan.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.962
[eerie, melancholic theme music plays]

03:10.593 --> 03:13.054
[Pryce] You have reached the
office of Dr. Johann Pryce.

03:13.178 --> 03:15.473
After the beep tone, please speak clearly,

03:15.556 --> 03:18.434
state your name, the time you
called, and leave a detailed message.

03:18.518 --> 03:21.855
I will return your call
at my earliest convenience.

03:21.938 --> 03:23.857
- [beep]
- We need to talk now.

03:23.940 --> 03:27.152
It's important. I don't want
to get into it over the phone.

03:27.234 --> 03:29.570
Call me back. It's important.

03:29.654 --> 03:31.572
Roman Godfrey.

03:31.656 --> 03:33.783
- [beeping]
- [sighs]

03:47.130 --> 03:50.633
- The baby...
- Whose is it?

03:51.509 --> 03:54.387
I mean, well, are you the father?

03:55.889 --> 03:57.974
Not that it's any of my business,

03:58.058 --> 04:02.228
but with all the secrecy
and the weird baby bunker...

04:02.311 --> 04:04.313
I mean, what's up with that?

04:05.106 --> 04:08.484
It's a very... [clears throat]
It's a very complicated situation.

04:08.568 --> 04:10.361
How complicated can it be?

04:10.444 --> 04:12.864
Everyone comes from
somewhere. You did. I did.

04:12.947 --> 04:14.407
Where did the baby come from?

04:15.992 --> 04:19.286
I mean, if you don't want
to tell me, fine, but...

04:19.370 --> 04:22.665
... since I seem to be the kid's
major source of nourishment these days,

04:22.749 --> 04:24.667
I thought I'd ask.

04:25.835 --> 04:29.047
The father's not in the
picture, and the mother's dead.

04:29.130 --> 04:31.591
And you're taking care
of this child because...

04:31.674 --> 04:35.220
Look, Miranda, it's really not
something you need to worry about, OK?

04:35.302 --> 04:39.348
- Now, I really need to get going.
- Well, I am fucking lactating.

04:39.432 --> 04:42.102
- Who fucking lactates?
- Mammals, mostly.

04:42.185 --> 04:44.771
Who have been pregnant
and have had offspring.

04:44.854 --> 04:47.774
I have not been pregnant.
I have not had offspring.

04:47.857 --> 04:50.317
I... I do not even like children.

04:50.401 --> 04:53.487
Children are sticky. They smell funny.

04:53.571 --> 04:56.991
This town is giving me the creeps.
I have got to get out of here.

04:57.075 --> 05:00.036
I am sure there's a perfectly reasonable
explanation for what you're going through.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.913
There is something wrong here.

05:01.996 --> 05:04.916
Very wrong! My Aunt Margo
died at a young age...

05:04.999 --> 05:06.500
This isn't fatal!

05:07.835 --> 05:10.004
I promise. Maybe a little messy.

05:10.088 --> 05:13.925
- And uncomfortable, and...
- You're not gonna die!

05:14.008 --> 05:16.594
Aunt Margo did, because
she carried the death gene,

05:16.677 --> 05:18.138
and I bet it means that I do, too.

05:18.221 --> 05:20.265
If you're that worried,
we'll get you to a doctor, OK?

05:20.347 --> 05:24.644
One who specializes in
spontaneous freak lactation?

05:24.727 --> 05:27.313
Arnold Spivak. He's
good. The family doctor.

05:27.396 --> 05:30.775
Dr. Arnold's been in Hemlock Grove
as long as anyone can remember.

05:30.858 --> 05:33.945
Conway will drive you. Have
the bill sent to me, OK?

05:34.028 --> 05:37.865
- But what if...
- Everything's gonna be OK, Miranda.

05:43.621 --> 05:46.958
Deputy said you needed to talk.

05:47.041 --> 05:49.669
Ready to explain why you're
going around making death threats?

05:49.752 --> 05:52.797
They weren't death threats.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.301
Look, I'm gonna lay something on
you, and you're not gonna believe me.

05:56.383 --> 05:58.886
Hm! I can't wait.

05:58.970 --> 06:01.806
There's been a series of
accidents where people have died,

06:01.889 --> 06:03.808
only they're not accidents.

06:03.891 --> 06:05.893
They're made to look that way
so they fly under police radar.

06:05.977 --> 06:07.895
And you know this how?

06:07.979 --> 06:11.440
I see what's gonna happen in
dreams before it goes down.

06:11.524 --> 06:14.443
And I have a pet unicorn I
bought on the planet Zorknoin.

06:14.527 --> 06:15.987
I told you weren't going to believe it!

06:16.070 --> 06:17.780
And you knew that on
account of you being psychic?

06:17.864 --> 06:20.074
I had another dream, here last night.

06:20.158 --> 06:22.451
There was this kid that was
in trouble, he was underwater,

06:22.535 --> 06:25.205
like on that Nirvana album cover.

06:25.288 --> 06:27.332
And then there was a German shepherd!

06:27.414 --> 06:29.458
Look, if you're not gonna
do something about this,

06:29.542 --> 06:31.544
I need to figure this out so
I can do something about this,

06:31.627 --> 06:34.088
but I can't do that in here!

06:39.927 --> 06:42.638
Lucky for you, the woman you
threatened scrammed out of town.

06:42.722 --> 06:45.975
No one's around to press any charges.

06:46.059 --> 06:48.811
I'm obliged to cut you loose.

06:52.106 --> 06:55.651
I catch you stimulating your
too-fertile imagination with weed

06:55.735 --> 06:57.570
or whatever you're hopped up on...

06:58.445 --> 07:00.656
... you'll be sitting down for a long time.

07:38.069 --> 07:40.446
Let's have a look under the hood.

07:44.951 --> 07:48.121
Oh, yes. No scarring.

07:48.204 --> 07:50.706
Good soft palate.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.292
Hm!

07:53.709 --> 07:57.297
Do you pee with excitement every time
you marvel at your genius with a scalpel?

07:57.380 --> 07:59.382
I pride myself on my
superior bladder control.

07:59.465 --> 08:01.550
Someone's in a buoyant mood.

08:02.927 --> 08:04.511
Roman called.

08:04.595 --> 08:08.849
Judging from his tone, which could only
be described as verging on the desperate,

08:08.933 --> 08:11.644
I think we may be coming
to an understanding.

08:12.979 --> 08:14.230
This is good news.

08:14.314 --> 08:17.066
That he's calling a third
party instead of his mother?

08:17.150 --> 08:20.445
Well, given the historically
rotten relationship between you two,

08:20.527 --> 08:22.405
I'll take the win.

08:23.364 --> 08:26.200
- What's this?
- Nicked myself.

08:27.076 --> 08:28.995
It will heal.

08:29.078 --> 08:31.705
Well, you're overdue for lab work anyway.

08:31.789 --> 08:33.874
I'll update you on my meeting with Roman.

08:48.597 --> 08:50.141
[gasping]

09:04.489 --> 09:05.823
Guess what?

09:10.703 --> 09:12.621
It's my parents'.

09:12.705 --> 09:14.707
We can play a game.

09:27.594 --> 09:29.180
[beeping]

09:40.649 --> 09:42.485
[boy sighs]

09:42.568 --> 09:44.404
Are you gonna play?

09:58.876 --> 10:01.879
- Where the fuck have you been?
- It's a long story.

10:01.962 --> 10:04.215
We were supposed to be at the
lady lawyer's 15 minutes ago.

10:04.298 --> 10:05.966
- What?
- She worked out a plea,

10:06.050 --> 10:08.052
and we're supposed to go over
it with her before we see Lynda.

10:08.135 --> 10:10.971
- I need to make a call first.
- Well, do it on the way.

10:11.055 --> 10:13.349
- I'm out of juice.
- Let's go!

10:13.433 --> 10:14.975
[line ringing]

10:16.685 --> 10:19.730
I had another one. We need
to put our heads together.

10:19.813 --> 10:21.482
I'll call you later.

10:24.402 --> 10:26.279
Let's fucking go.

10:28.406 --> 10:30.783
New charges have been filed.

10:30.866 --> 10:33.786
Your mother's alleged to
have received stolen property:

10:33.869 --> 10:37.248
a shipment of Christian Louboutin
Palais Royal luxury shoes.

10:37.331 --> 10:39.333
I wear the pair she gave me all the time.

10:39.417 --> 10:42.462
She's being hit with 15
counts of grand larceny

10:42.545 --> 10:44.505
and conspiracy to
distribute stolen property.

10:44.589 --> 10:46.799
- It's nonsense!
- Anything involving the rich and famous

10:46.882 --> 10:49.469
is like catnip to a prosecutor
with political ambitions.

10:49.552 --> 10:52.597
- How is this Lynda's problem?
- It just is.

10:52.679 --> 10:55.558
- How big of a problem?
- Ten years.

10:55.641 --> 10:57.184
You told us you were
gonna make this go away!

10:57.268 --> 11:00.480
I told you that I would give your
mother the best defense possible,

11:00.563 --> 11:04.066
- which I have, but these new charges...
- Ten years is totally unacceptable!

11:04.150 --> 11:05.943
- Peter!
- Then what was the 20 grand for?

11:06.026 --> 11:11.240
Mr. Rumancek, I am exploring every remedy
available, but you have to understand...

11:11.324 --> 11:13.159
I know a hustle when I see one.
I'm a gypsy for fuck's sakes.

11:13.242 --> 11:15.578
And this is a low-rent, rat-shit hustle!

11:17.163 --> 11:18.498
Jesus.

11:28.966 --> 11:30.717
[elevator dings]

11:34.847 --> 11:37.517
You have a two o'clock with
the company photographer.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.519
They need a portrait
for the annual report...

11:39.602 --> 11:41.770
- Cancel.
- The chamber of commerce, they want...

11:41.854 --> 11:44.982
Not interested. Has Pryce called?

11:45.065 --> 11:47.818
No. Should I try him?

11:58.538 --> 12:01.165
[rapid beeping]

12:12.426 --> 12:14.303
[elevator dings]

13:20.620 --> 13:23.163
She's come quite a long
way since you saw her last.

13:24.081 --> 13:26.417
But you probably don't remember.

13:27.167 --> 13:31.464
Say hello to Prycilla, the first
human being ever to be created

13:31.547 --> 13:33.798
in an extra-uterine environment.

13:35.092 --> 13:38.512
But enough about me, let me introduce
you to another of my creations,

13:38.596 --> 13:40.640
one that will set you free.

13:41.348 --> 13:43.183
Once and for all.

13:58.115 --> 14:01.243
The work product from a wide
spectrum of genetic experiments

14:01.327 --> 14:05.665
we've been conducting, repurposed
here as a nutrient concentrate

14:05.748 --> 14:08.501
to satiate the upir appetite.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.257
[coughs]

14:15.341 --> 14:18.844
Takes some getting used to,
I know, but for your kind,

14:18.927 --> 14:22.973
this is on a par with the development
of agriculture 8,000 years ago.

14:24.057 --> 14:26.143
A reliable supply of sustenance

14:26.226 --> 14:29.438
that turned the hunter-gatherer
into civilized man.

14:29.522 --> 14:32.566
No more foraging in the
night to ward off starvation.

14:32.650 --> 14:37.279
No more preying on helpless
victims, taking innocent life.

14:39.198 --> 14:42.326
You've come home, Roman,
and you have me to thank.

14:59.968 --> 15:01.762
Drink.

15:14.775 --> 15:18.696
Right now, you feel like Jesus's son.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.952
No more, Roman, it's too soon!

15:27.913 --> 15:30.416
[choking]

15:32.418 --> 15:34.420
[grunts]

15:34.503 --> 15:36.213
Your metabolism needs to adjust.

16:38.525 --> 16:40.402
All right, another deep breath.

16:40.486 --> 16:42.738
[breathes deeply]

16:43.906 --> 16:45.031
Good.

16:45.115 --> 16:48.118
Yeah, the wife and I, we
took a trip to Norway once,

16:48.201 --> 16:50.120
and we were, you know, we're
tooling around the fjords

16:50.203 --> 16:54.834
in this rust bucket rental, and,
uh, you know, the tranny goes out.

16:54.917 --> 16:58.838
Neither of us drive stick, which
I'm sure was a contributing factor,

16:58.921 --> 17:02.549
but there we are, you know,
marooned in Trondheim, Norway.

17:02.633 --> 17:04.092
Look at my nose.

17:05.010 --> 17:08.262
Now, neither of us speaks Norwegian...

17:09.138 --> 17:11.474
... which is not a crime by the way.

17:11.558 --> 17:13.435
Here, you can lean back.

17:13.519 --> 17:16.146
But the Norwegians... Oh, my Lord...

17:18.106 --> 17:20.317
... took it as this personal affront.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.277
That you didn't speak Norwegian?

17:22.361 --> 17:24.570
Oh, don't let the
reindeer sweaters fool ya.

17:24.655 --> 17:27.700
They are just a loathsome
bunch, the Norwegians.

17:27.782 --> 17:29.075
Never ever go there.

17:29.159 --> 17:32.162
All right. Here we go! Bottom line.

17:32.245 --> 17:35.290
All right, young lady. You are a
perfectly healthy 21-year-old female

17:35.374 --> 17:38.002
unremarkable for any pathology
or illness, all right?

17:38.084 --> 17:40.587
I'm not saying you're not remarkable. OK?

17:40.671 --> 17:43.256
It's just doctor speak
for "you ain't sick." OK?

17:43.340 --> 17:46.010
Thank you, Pearl.

17:46.510 --> 17:49.304
Hey, I bet you the guy who ran
you off the road's a New Yorker.

17:49.388 --> 17:51.515
They tend to drive through
here like a bat out of hell.

17:51.598 --> 17:54.518
So how come I'm lactating
for no known reason?

17:54.601 --> 17:57.980
There's your answer: no known reason.
Lactation is a physiological response

17:58.063 --> 18:01.149
to a whole complex of stimuli.
There's emotional, there's hormonal,

18:01.233 --> 18:03.276
there's environmental, there's, uh...

18:03.360 --> 18:05.905
you know, etcetera, etcetera. My guess?

18:05.988 --> 18:08.866
It probably has to do with this
infant you've been hanging around.

18:08.949 --> 18:11.117
Without ever being pregnant?

18:11.201 --> 18:13.871
Yeah. It's not common, but it's not
unheard of. It's called pseudocyesis.

18:13.954 --> 18:15.873
The body acts like it's
pregnant when it's not.

18:17.123 --> 18:19.209
[laughing gently] It's surprising, sure.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.627
It's, uh, you know, it's
inconvenient, sure, but...

18:20.711 --> 18:22.713
- Yeah.
- No cause for alarm.

18:22.796 --> 18:25.049
- You don't have to worry.
- OK.

18:25.131 --> 18:26.508
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do though.

18:26.592 --> 18:29.553
I'm gonna give you an analgesic for

18:29.636 --> 18:32.138

18:32.222 --> 18:34.140
I have some samples around here someplace.

18:35.475 --> 18:37.644
So you're staying with Roman Godfrey?

18:37.728 --> 18:39.897
- Um, yeah. Temporarily.
- Ahh.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.441
I haven't seen Roman
since he was like, uh...

18:42.524 --> 18:44.693
... had his chicken pox,
whenever that was. How's he doing?

18:44.777 --> 18:48.072
Oh, he's good, I guess. I don't...
Just met him the other day.

18:48.154 --> 18:50.449
He's a good boy. Tries to
do the right thing, you know.

18:50.532 --> 18:53.201
But... given his family history...

18:53.285 --> 18:55.537
Oh, good heavens.

18:55.621 --> 18:57.539
He doesn't really talk about that stuff.

18:57.623 --> 18:59.207
Can you blame him for that?

18:59.332 --> 19:01.126
- All right, there you go.
- Thanks.

19:01.209 --> 19:03.462
Mrs. Blaylock is on line one.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.422
Oh, brother!

19:08.592 --> 19:11.637
Hello, Mrs. Blaylock. How are you?

19:11.720 --> 19:15.390
Oh, that good, huh? Hey, I
wanna see you in two weeks.

19:15.474 --> 19:18.477
If you need anything in the meantime,
you can just give me a call, OK?

19:18.560 --> 19:20.520
Yes, I'm right here, Mrs. Blaylock.

19:21.897 --> 19:24.232
[whispering] Psst. Any
time, call me day or night.

19:25.609 --> 19:29.071
Well, that would rule out
appendicitis, Mrs. Blaylock,

19:29.154 --> 19:31.239
'cause you need an appendix.

19:31.323 --> 19:34.076
[bell ringing]

19:34.910 --> 19:36.870
[Destiny] There's no
excuse for what you did.

19:36.954 --> 19:39.665
Frieda what-the-fuck's-her-name
stole our money.

19:39.748 --> 19:41.667
You broke her stuff for chrissake.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.585
I told you this would
happen on account of...

19:43.669 --> 19:46.296
This has nothing to do
with the moon, I'm fine!

19:46.379 --> 19:48.548
I have every reason to
be pissed at that shyster.

19:48.632 --> 19:51.802
You are not fine. You're
turning into a total basket case.

19:51.885 --> 19:54.972
Disappearing to God knows where,
losing your cool all the time...

19:55.055 --> 19:57.182
My mom's rotting away in prison.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.310
Did you do it again?

20:00.393 --> 20:02.813
- What?
- Turn.

20:04.064 --> 20:06.942
- No.
- Look me in the eye.

20:10.112 --> 20:12.114
I have not turned.

20:12.197 --> 20:15.283
And you haven't been
fooling with those dreams?

20:15.367 --> 20:19.746
- On my gypsy's honor.
- [scoffs] That's what worries me.

20:19.830 --> 20:22.916
When we go in there, we need
to accentuate the positive.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.044
There's no point sugarcoating this, D.

20:25.127 --> 20:28.005
It's just another Romancek
getting totally fucked!

20:28.088 --> 20:30.132
She hears doom and gloom
coming from her only son,

20:30.215 --> 20:33.218
you're gonna destroy whatever hope she has.

20:35.679 --> 20:38.765
[indistinct chatter]

20:46.773 --> 20:49.359
You ought to see what the
other three chicks look like.

20:50.736 --> 20:53.321
Um... we just came from the lady lawyer's.

20:53.405 --> 20:56.075
She says there's plenty
of reason for optimism.

20:56.158 --> 20:59.285
Right. Uh, something about
improper warrants or something.

20:59.369 --> 21:02.706
She thinks there's a good chance we can
get a lot of these charges tossed out.

21:02.789 --> 21:05.500
Next time she's in front of the judge,
she's gonna kick ass and take names, OK?

21:05.625 --> 21:07.753
OK. Don't you kids worry about me.

21:07.836 --> 21:12.049
- The good news is I'm being transferred.
- Transferred where?

21:12.132 --> 21:14.885
Who knows? But the food has
got to be better than here.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.849
No glum faces, this too shall pass.

21:28.857 --> 21:32.111
- It didn't go as well as hoped.
- He resisted?

21:32.194 --> 21:34.571
Quite the opposite. He showed
no restraint whatsoever.

21:34.654 --> 21:37.866
Oh, dear. He had an uncle like
that. Never knew when to stop.

21:37.950 --> 21:40.202
Well, now Roman wants nothing
to do with any of it at all.

21:40.285 --> 21:43.705
This thing about becoming upir
can be quite disorienting at first.

21:43.789 --> 21:46.041
I'm worried about the damage
he could do in the short term:

21:46.125 --> 21:48.752
exposing the lab,
shutting down my research.

21:48.835 --> 21:50.754
Don't overreact, Johann. If you'll recall,

21:50.837 --> 21:52.965
I was quite a handful when
I first began the treatments.

21:53.048 --> 21:56.135
I have the results of your blood tests.

21:56.218 --> 21:59.304
These anomalies you've
been exhibiting lately:

21:59.387 --> 22:01.431
normal human emotion,

22:01.514 --> 22:03.809
the diminishing rate of healing
consistent with a non-upir metabolism...

22:03.892 --> 22:05.602
Hate it.

22:05.685 --> 22:07.562
There are specific changes taking place

22:07.687 --> 22:09.689
in your bloodstream I
had not noticed before.

22:09.773 --> 22:12.358
I measured your telomeres
as a baseline for my research

22:12.442 --> 22:15.445
prior to Roman's attack, then again today.

22:15.528 --> 22:17.823
They've shortened much
faster than anticipated.

22:17.906 --> 22:21.493
- Jesus, Johann, get to the point!
- You're aging at an accelerated rate.

22:21.576 --> 22:24.163
Clearly one of your lab
retards made a mistake.

22:24.246 --> 22:26.748
I double-checked the results myself.

22:28.959 --> 22:31.253
How long does this condition last?

22:31.295 --> 22:33.588
We're in unchartered territory.

22:33.672 --> 22:38.260
There's no clinical data for the effects
of upir neurotoxin on another upir.

22:38.342 --> 22:41.429
Are you telling me I only have
a couple of hundred years left?

22:41.513 --> 22:43.932
More like a normal human lifespan.

22:44.057 --> 22:46.476
Human lifespan is over like that.

22:46.559 --> 22:48.603
Hardly worth going to
the trouble of being born.

22:48.687 --> 22:51.523
And it's also possible
it could reverse itself.

22:54.943 --> 22:58.197
- Creeping mother of Christ.
- You know, it's Roman

22:58.280 --> 23:00.782
who should be concerned
about his longevity...

23:00.866 --> 23:03.869
... if he disrupts my Ouroboros research.

23:03.952 --> 23:07.497
I need to help him get his footing
in this new chapter of his life.

23:07.580 --> 23:12.044
- Even after what he did to you?
- He and the baby are all I have left.

23:13.295 --> 23:15.214
Compassion doesn't suit you, Olivia.

23:15.297 --> 23:18.508
I miss that venomous disposition

23:18.591 --> 23:21.427
and that heart the size of a caraway seed.

23:27.059 --> 23:30.854
Well, despite what she says,
our marriage is not boring.

23:30.937 --> 23:34.066
I'm not boring. I do
lots of exciting things:

23:34.149 --> 23:36.651
crosswords, archery...

23:36.735 --> 23:39.279
Well, it's your wife you
need to convince, not me.

23:39.403 --> 23:41.073
I hold the record in western Pennsylvania

23:41.156 --> 23:44.617
for constructing 37 ships in
bottles in a one-year period.

23:44.701 --> 23:47.287
I mean, if that isn't not
boring, I don't know what is.

23:48.830 --> 23:50.999
Another thing she doesn't
give me enough credit for

23:51.083 --> 23:53.459
is pitching in around the house.

23:53.543 --> 23:57.547
Last night I made dinner. Meatloaf and
gravy with peas and mashed potatoes.

23:57.630 --> 24:01.425
I thought about making baked potatoes,
then I changed my mind and went...

24:01.509 --> 24:04.012
[Shelley] Dear, Uncle Norman. I'm OK.

24:04.096 --> 24:07.640
But there are so many reasons why I
can't accept your kind offer of help.

24:07.724 --> 24:10.810
You have already done so much. Not
believing all the terrible things

24:10.894 --> 24:13.813

all those awful crimes.

24:13.897 --> 24:15.899
You have stood by me through all of it.

24:15.982 --> 24:18.235
That's what gives me the strength to go on.

24:18.318 --> 24:20.820
Helping me any more would
only get you in trouble.

24:20.904 --> 24:25.992
Goodbye, Uncle Norman. Whatever
happens, I will always love you. Shelley.

- No, it's not right.

to reflect on her poor behavior.

He tried to cop a feel.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.662
Yeah. Olivia told me.

33:30.745 --> 33:34.415
- She was the last person who saw her.
- I've already been over this.

33:34.499 --> 33:36.208
I think you should put
me in a room with her.

33:36.292 --> 33:39.963
What for? She's already told
the guy everything she knows.

33:40.045 --> 33:43.508
Olivia has cooperated
in every conceivable way.

33:43.591 --> 33:46.511
I don't want her bothered any
more than she already has been.

33:46.594 --> 33:49.180
It's no accident that, you know, Marie,
she threatens to sue the White Tower

33:49.263 --> 33:51.683
and then she goes missing?

33:51.766 --> 33:54.602
Maybe you should be looking into that.

34:12.203 --> 34:14.746
[footsteps approaching]

34:50.616 --> 34:53.619
[breathing deeply]

35:05.840 --> 35:09.385
[beeping]

35:10.053 --> 35:12.055
[baby cooing]

35:24.776 --> 35:28.696
You... are so beautiful.

35:43.502 --> 35:45.421
Honey, I'm home.

35:47.548 --> 35:51.552
- How'd it go with the doctor?
- Headline:

35:51.636 --> 35:54.472
Turning into a Dairy Cow, Who Knows Why,

35:54.555 --> 35:57.642
While Completely Bizarre,
Is Not Life-threatening.

35:57.725 --> 35:59.435
Didn't I tell you?

36:01.353 --> 36:04.523
- Dr. Spivak says hi, by the way.
- Hm! Nice guy.

36:04.607 --> 36:07.777
Yeah, and completely hilarious.

36:07.860 --> 36:11.656
He said this is... mostly happening

36:11.739 --> 36:14.325
on account of me being around the baby.

36:15.159 --> 36:17.120
- You told him?
- Yeah.

36:17.202 --> 36:19.246
After I specifically told you not to?

36:19.330 --> 36:22.583
Well, gee, in a conversation
about mother's milk,

36:22.667 --> 36:26.796
the subject of a baby just
happened to come up. Imagine that.

36:26.879 --> 36:29.465
- Now somebody else knows.
- And why is that such a big fucking deal?

36:29.548 --> 36:31.884
Because it is. It's a big fucking deal, OK?

36:31.968 --> 36:34.595
- It's not like he's gonna tell anyone.
- You don't know that!

36:34.679 --> 36:36.931
There's a little thing
called the Hippocratic oath.

36:37.015 --> 36:39.391
"Thou shalt not run your mouth
about your patient's business."

36:39.475 --> 36:41.727
But nobody else.

36:41.811 --> 36:43.729
Not a soul outside the walls
of this house, understand?

36:43.813 --> 36:46.190
Jesus, Roman, I wish
you could hear yourself.

36:46.273 --> 36:49.360
You sound like some kind of paranoid loon.

36:53.990 --> 36:58.036
There's a history of
abuse in the baby's family.

36:58.119 --> 37:00.872
I want to keep her as far
away from that as I can.

37:03.749 --> 37:06.502
I have to ask, is any of
that even remotely true?

37:06.585 --> 37:08.462
A hundred percent.

37:08.546 --> 37:10.464
Her grandmother's dangerous.

37:10.548 --> 37:13.134
And that's why you're keeping this...

37:13.968 --> 37:15.887
... deep dark baby secret?

37:15.970 --> 37:17.805
Yeah.

37:17.889 --> 37:21.559
Then why didn't you tell me instead
of having me walk around on eggshells

37:21.642 --> 37:24.562
with no fucking clue? It's really not fair.

37:24.645 --> 37:27.899
You're right. It's not fair.

37:31.152 --> 37:33.571
Pretty selfish, actually.

37:38.743 --> 37:42.413
Jeez, you look like the dog's dinner.

37:42.496 --> 37:45.791
I haven't been feeling too good lately.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.794
If you're coming down with
something, don't give it to me.

37:48.878 --> 37:51.005
I don't want the baby getting sick, too.

37:51.089 --> 37:53.174
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

37:58.096 --> 38:00.056
What's wrong?

38:00.139 --> 38:02.016
Are you OK?

38:05.436 --> 38:08.480
So here's... here's
what's up with the baby.

38:08.564 --> 38:12.944
It's mine. It was an unplanned pregnancy.

38:13.027 --> 38:14.904
The mother died in childbirth.

38:15.863 --> 38:19.491
I'm trying to be a father.
Obviously not a very good one, but...

38:19.575 --> 38:22.787
No. You're there for her.

38:22.870 --> 38:24.538
That's huge.

38:25.623 --> 38:28.542
So this, um, crazy granny...

38:28.626 --> 38:31.503
Is my mother.

38:33.214 --> 38:35.382
Wow.

38:37.301 --> 38:39.262
My daughter and I, we're...
we're terrified of each other.

38:39.344 --> 38:42.265
She starts screaming as
soon as I get close to her.

38:42.347 --> 38:44.976
So I panic and head for the hills.
I don't... I don't know how to...

38:45.059 --> 38:48.938
These things will settle
down soon enough. It just...

38:49.021 --> 38:50.856
It takes some time.

38:50.940 --> 38:53.442
Look, I know you didn't
sign up for any of this,

38:53.525 --> 38:56.904
but you need to know how
grateful I am. We are.

38:59.031 --> 39:01.492
I don't... I don't know what's going on.

39:01.575 --> 39:05.746
I'm just dealing with what's
being presented to me, is all.

39:07.581 --> 39:09.750
I guess that's how the universe works.

39:11.627 --> 39:15.923
Or doesn't work... 'cause
it's all just smashed to hell

39:16.007 --> 39:19.135
and we're just a couple of broken
pieces and none of this means anything.

39:22.721 --> 39:25.933
Go take a look in your kid's eyes,

39:26.017 --> 39:29.394
and tell me you still believe that.

39:44.076 --> 39:46.245
Come here, ice man.

39:54.586 --> 39:58.216
[slow, melancholic ballad playing]

41:04.031 --> 41:05.950
If there's any place on
Earth that you can lay low

41:06.033 --> 41:07.952
and never get caught,
it's probably Romania.

41:08.035 --> 41:10.495
Because nobody wants to go, including me.

41:10.579 --> 41:12.790
Actually, it's quite beautiful.

41:12.873 --> 41:15.084
I don't mean to seem ungrateful
for all you guys have done,

41:15.167 --> 41:17.544
but I don't know anybody there.
It's not like I have any friends.

41:17.628 --> 41:21.299
- We have plenty of family there.
- I barely speak the language, Peter.

41:36.647 --> 41:39.024
- Am I never going to see you again?
- Of course.

41:39.108 --> 41:41.860
Of course, you're gonna see
me again. As a matter of fact,

41:41.944 --> 41:43.862
I'll have Andreas whip me up a new identity

41:43.946 --> 41:46.698
and we'll start over together in Bucharest.

41:46.782 --> 41:48.700
Your life is here, Peter.

41:48.784 --> 41:51.495
My life is wherever I
am. You taught me that.

41:51.578 --> 41:54.832
I know, but the people in
Hemlock Grove, they need you.

41:54.915 --> 41:58.294
- How do you know?
- I'm not sure. It's just...

41:58.377 --> 42:00.463
It's very important you stay.

42:00.587 --> 42:02.589
Mama's has a feeling about
this, and I'm never wrong

42:02.673 --> 42:05.092
about these kind of things. Be a good boy.

42:06.260 --> 42:08.762
Man, I mean man.

42:22.567 --> 42:24.695
Drive up here wasn't too bad,
but the wait at the border,

42:24.778 --> 42:26.447
getting through customs was a nightmare.

42:27.448 --> 42:30.909
No way are we going back home
until I'm sure everything's OK.

42:30.993 --> 42:33.245
I mean, Jack almost
got run over by a truck.

42:33.329 --> 42:35.956
Some sicko kid tells me it's not
safe 'cause people are after me.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.625
More than happy to spend a
couple weeks up here with Mom,

42:38.709 --> 42:40.585
watching hockey and eating poutines.

42:40.669 --> 42:42.587
Even though my thighs
are gonna hate me, eh?

42:43.630 --> 42:46.675
[chuckling] He's upstairs having a bath.

42:55.559 --> 42:57.769
[crickets chirping]

42:57.853 --> 43:00.147
[dog barking]

43:04.026 --> 43:08.155
[man] Excuse me. Yeah,
looks OK. Neighborhood watch.

43:11.783 --> 43:14.119
[banging]

43:15.162 --> 43:16.663
Hello?

43:20.584 --> 43:23.462
- [man] Anyone down there?
- Negative!

43:27.258 --> 43:29.343
Lets go, let's go!

43:44.483 --> 43:46.902
[panting]

44:06.130 --> 44:08.340
So I met this guy at
work. Fortyish, nerd cute.

44:08.424 --> 44:10.593
Another refugee from the divorce wars.

44:10.675 --> 44:13.804
His name's Jeremy. Capricorn.
Loves all things Walking Dead.

44:13.887 --> 44:15.806
Asked me to smuggle some Cuban cigars

44:15.889 --> 44:18.183
back to the States for him,
which I'm not going to do

44:18.267 --> 44:20.185
because then he will
smell like cigar smoke.

44:20.269 --> 44:23.314
No, I haven't slept with him
yet, I'm not a complete slut.

44:32.072 --> 44:35.326
Jack! Jack!

44:39.497 --> 44:41.415
Oh, God.

44:41.499 --> 44:43.459
Oh, God, Jack.

44:44.835 --> 44:46.669
Jack.

44:46.753 --> 44:48.422
[sobbing]

44:48.506 --> 44:50.174
Jack.

44:55.095 --> 44:58.432
Her GFRs are back to normal,
and the creatine composition

44:58.516 --> 45:00.643
indicates robust renal sufficiency.

45:00.725 --> 45:03.728
Good. At this point,
extraction is wholly dependent

45:03.812 --> 45:05.523
on her monoclonal antibody development.

45:06.357 --> 45:08.192
And now, on a more pressing matter,

45:08.275 --> 45:10.653
I need the enzyme inhibitor
I asked for posthaste.

45:10.735 --> 45:15.199
I'm getting an anomalous molecular
weight in the purified polypeptide chain.

45:15.282 --> 45:18.785
- So what are you telling me?
- The gel filtration of lysate...

45:18.869 --> 45:20.871
No excuses, I want that inhibitor now.

45:20.954 --> 45:23.415
- I need few days more...
- Unacceptable!

45:23.499 --> 45:26.335
I am not understanding
the urgency of something

45:26.418 --> 45:30.381
that has almost no practical
application beyond killing host organism.

45:30.464 --> 45:34.926
Why or how I choose to use that
enzyme is of no concern of yours.

45:35.010 --> 45:37.846
Yes, but it is matter
of allocating resources.

45:37.929 --> 45:39.515
Hear me...

45:40.641 --> 45:44.311
... and hear me well, you
Bolshevik stool sample.

45:44.395 --> 45:46.897
Unless you want to find
yourself on trial in the Hague

45:46.980 --> 45:50.484
for war crimes like your
asshole buddy, Chemical Ali...

45:52.819 --> 45:55.531
... get me my fucking enzyme.

46:04.623 --> 46:09.294
How about we go raise a glass
to new life in the old country?

46:09.378 --> 46:11.296
Not really in a glass-raising mood.

46:14.258 --> 46:18.345
- We did a good thing today.
- Yeah, we did.

46:31.650 --> 46:33.277
Good evening, Sheriff.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.655
- I need you to come down to the station.
- Is there a problem?

46:36.739 --> 46:39.575
That woman and her kid you scared
the crap out of over in Greensburg...

46:39.658 --> 46:41.826
Just got off the phone
with the sheriff there.

46:41.910 --> 46:43.828
She and her boy are dead.

46:46.624 --> 46:48.626
Jesus. How?

46:49.585 --> 46:53.756
She drowned the kid in the bathtub,
then jumped out a window ten stories up.

46:55.798 --> 46:59.136
And I'm willing to bet there's a
German shepherd in the mix somewhere.

46:59.219 --> 47:02.514
Either you're part of a
multinational gang of killers

47:02.598 --> 47:03.848
with a field office in Toronto...

47:03.932 --> 47:06.560
Or what? You actually did
buy a unicorn on Zorknoin?

47:06.644 --> 47:08.562
Let's just say I'm not unfamiliar

47:08.646 --> 47:10.731
with events and situations
that are out of the ordinary.

47:15.486 --> 47:17.820
[clock ticking]

47:25.954 --> 47:29.291
[heart beating]

47:44.640 --> 47:46.308
I couldn't sleep.

47:48.059 --> 47:51.104
Yeah, well, you're creeping me out.

47:51.188 --> 47:53.357
You shouldn't drink so much coffee.

47:54.983 --> 47:58.362
I should probably feed the baby.

48:00.698 --> 48:02.658
I can't believe I just said that.

48:20.008 --> 48:21.552
[inhaling]

48:21.635 --> 48:24.847

[thud]

48:47.703 --> 48:49.621
[gasps]

48:51.540 --> 48:53.625
Don't hurt me. Whatever you
want, take it, just don't hurt me.

48:53.709 --> 48:55.669
Please. I'm fucking freezing!

48:55.753 --> 48:57.713
They stop fighting, you
know, when they understand

48:57.796 --> 48:59.840
it's OK to die. It's OK. Sayonara, life.

48:59.922 --> 49:02.718
- Roman...
- I gotta live like this.

49:02.801 --> 49:04.553
They don't get to die. Am I
making myself clear, Dr. Pryce?

49:04.636 --> 49:08.724
Absolutely clear. Let's just
take a moment and calm down...

49:08.807 --> 49:11.894
Do not tell me to calm down! That
great big fucking bird's coming.

49:11.976 --> 49:14.312
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!
Pecking at my fucking guts.

49:14.396 --> 49:16.314
Make it stop, it hurts so fucking bad.

49:16.398 --> 49:19.025
- I'll make it stop, Roman.
- Will you?

49:19.109 --> 49:21.653
I'll do anything you
want. Here, keys to my car.

49:21.737 --> 49:24.281
Take 'em, take 'em, take 'em!

49:24.364 --> 49:26.283
The White Tower, it's yours.

49:26.366 --> 49:28.827
I'll make it stop.

49:28.911 --> 49:30.788
Thank you, thank you. I
don't want to be this thing.

49:30.871 --> 49:33.039
I don't want to be hungry all the time!

49:33.123 --> 49:36.293
[Roman crying]

49:36.376 --> 49:38.961
I have to warn you, what's on my mind

49:39.045 --> 49:41.757
has never been tried
before. It might not work.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.760
Just no more whoop, whoop, whoop.

49:44.885 --> 49:46.845
Please, no more.

49:48.472 --> 49:51.974
[sobbing] Please, I don't
want to hurt anyone anymore.

49:52.058 --> 49:55.312
- You're safe now.
- Don't let me be like her.

49:55.395 --> 49:57.481
I'll take care of you.

49:57.564 --> 50:00.525
Everything's going to be OK.
