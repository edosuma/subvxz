<i>- Previously on "Million
Dollar Listing Los Angeles."</i>

00:15.548 --> 00:16.515
<i>- Whoa.</i>

00:16.582 --> 00:18.583
- Oh, my goodness.
- Holy sh--.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.720
What is this?
- It's called the sky window.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.587
- What happens when it rains?
- You're screwed.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.123
[laughter]

00:24.125 --> 00:26.058
<i>- You get the views
from downtown</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:28.027
<i>all the way out
to Pacific Ocean.</i>

00:28.095 --> 00:30.262
<i>We're priced at $29.995</i>

00:30.329 --> 00:32.531
- Definitely sexy, I will say.

00:32.599 --> 00:34.399
- In the Elliman rankings,

00:34.467 --> 00:36.001
we got number one
in the country at Elliman.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.603
<i>- That's good.
- And then there was</i>

00:37.605 --> 00:40.106
another page that said,

00:40.172 --> 00:43.675
and we present this special
award to Fredrik Eklund.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.811
- That's nice.
- Frederik requested

00:45.878 --> 00:48.514
that they create
an award for him.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.616
It's like, I got my work
'cause I earned it.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.684
But Fredrik called the executive

00:52.686 --> 00:54.286
to make up an award for you.

00:54.353 --> 00:58.189
- It just didn't feel right
when we are clearly so big.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.526
- I mean, I'm just saying
Fredrik, it's bullsh--.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.306
- Dude, Crestview's in escrow,

01:14.373 --> 01:16.842
La Hoya's in escrow,
Bellagio just closed,

01:16.844 --> 01:19.045
and it's all about
pricing these things right.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.146
- Yeah.
- Dude, we could hit

01:20.212 --> 01:22.314
$1/2 billion, David.

01:22.381 --> 01:26.652
- From your mouth to whoever
dictates how many deals we do.

01:26.719 --> 01:29.688
- My wife is, in this case.
[laughs]

01:32.559 --> 01:34.526
- What was the band?
- My singing group?

01:34.594 --> 01:35.794
- Yeah.
- Everything Nice.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.062
<i>- Were you a backup dancer?</i>

01:37.130 --> 01:40.465
- I was more of the rapper.
- Oh, it was hip hop? Got it.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.601
- And when my dad
was not supportive,

01:42.668 --> 01:44.603
I told him
when I got my first Grammy,

01:44.605 --> 01:47.105
he would not be thanked.
- Okay. [chuckles]

01:58.551 --> 01:59.352
- Hey.
- Josh.

01:59.418 --> 02:01.354
- How are ya?
- Good to see you, buddy.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.221
- Good to see you, man.
It's been a while.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.690
- You look good. Look at you.
- Oh, you too.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.257
The one thing I know about you,

02:06.326 --> 02:08.693
the most fashion-forward
developer in town.

02:08.761 --> 02:10.495
That's for sure.
- Gotta keep up with Altman.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.431
- I know Ray because
he's a major, major player

02:13.499 --> 02:15.300
<i>in the real estate game
out here.</i>

02:15.302 --> 02:17.236
His brand is top-notch.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.904
Congrats on
the last couple sales.

02:18.971 --> 02:20.572
You're on a roll, man.
- Appreciate it, man.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.375
<i>- Plus he's like
a young flashy guy.</i>

02:23.443 --> 02:25.544
I like him.
He's a Josh Altman type of guy.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.382
Right? [chuckles]

02:30.449 --> 02:32.218
So I see you're
basically just putting

02:32.284 --> 02:33.452
the finishing touches
on it right now.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.520
- That's it. Yep.

02:34.587 --> 02:35.988
Just the last touches
here and there.

02:36.055 --> 02:39.391
- So I have five other
properties in Brentwood

02:39.459 --> 02:43.262
between 30 and 55 million
right now, active.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.864
- Really?
- I know all the players

02:45.932 --> 02:47.667
that are looking right now
because they're coming through

02:47.733 --> 02:49.601
one of my properties
one way or another.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.737
<i>Brentwood is the place
where you go</i>

02:51.739 --> 02:54.806
when you're rich
and you care about schools.

02:54.874 --> 02:58.244
<i>Like, it's clean.
And like, the Brentwood market</i>

02:58.310 --> 03:00.412
<i>or the Brentwood country club.</i>

03:00.479 --> 03:01.613
Like, it's not Brentwood.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.482
[in haughty voice]
It's Brentwood.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.185
You know what I mean? It's,
like, not where I grew up.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.285
All right. Well, cool man.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.620
I'm like a kid in a candy store.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.754
Give me the tour.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.590
- Let me show you
what's going on.

03:13.492 --> 03:15.227
<i>- This is insane. What's the
square footage of this?</i>

03:15.229 --> 03:17.529
- We got about
50,000 square feet,

03:17.597 --> 03:18.498
<i>indoor and outdoor.</i>

03:18.564 --> 03:21.701
<i>The interior's approximately
about 20,000.</i>

03:24.437 --> 03:26.272
<i>There's a wow factor
in every single room.</i>

03:26.338 --> 03:27.305
<i>Right?
- Right.</i>

03:27.373 --> 03:28.940
- You walk in, high ceilings.

03:29.008 --> 03:32.711
<i>36 feet high.
Floor-to-ceiling glass walls.</i>

03:32.779 --> 03:35.381
- This is very cool.
The stone leading to the wood,

03:35.448 --> 03:38.249
it's almost like a stone rug.
- Pops up the furniture.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.318
You got the dual sided
fish aquarium right here.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.686
- Sick. How big is this tank?

03:41.754 --> 03:45.457
<i>- This one is 1,200 gallons.
- I love that.</i>

03:45.525 --> 03:48.528
<i>- So you got the main kitchen
over here.</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:54.499
And one of the amazing parts
is this whole living wall.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.069
- So what's the deal with this?
You gotta take care of it.

03:57.136 --> 03:58.603
<i>- It's moss.
You don't have to water.</i>

03:58.605 --> 04:00.672
Just with the air,
it keeps it going.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.408
- Do I blend in with my--
With my green?

04:03.476 --> 04:05.444
- That's the money shot
right there.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.615
<i>- All right, I want to check
out outside over here.</i>

04:13.520 --> 04:15.620
<i>- Can you imagine
a party out here?</i>

04:15.688 --> 04:18.389
<i>You can have a party
for 500 easily right here.</i>

04:18.458 --> 04:19.958
- Whoever buys this
is gonna have

04:19.960 --> 04:23.195
people over here all the time.
It's built for that.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.434
<i>- So you got the
bar lounge area down.</i>

04:29.502 --> 04:31.436
That's the champagne bar.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.938
<i>Backlit wall.
- Oh!</i>

04:35.909 --> 04:38.009
<i>- Yes!
- You know about that ceiling.</i>

04:38.011 --> 04:39.377
It's the Rolls-Royce ceiling.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.712
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Right?</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:41.780
<i>And then the furniture,</i>

04:41.848 --> 04:43.648
all the furniture's been
custom made for the house.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.351
<i>So you know, it's ready to go.
It's gonna be turnkey.</i>

04:46.353 --> 04:48.353
<i>- You knocked it out
of the park with this theater.</i>

04:48.355 --> 04:49.521
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

04:49.589 --> 04:52.024
- Then from here
into the indoor pool,

04:52.091 --> 04:55.127
<i>the spa right here.
This is an all-jet swim, Josh.</i>

04:55.194 --> 04:57.462
All right? So you're swimming
against the jet.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.732
And then you're sitting
against the wall,

04:59.799 --> 05:01.967
check out what happens.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.539
- What?
- That's it.

05:07.607 --> 05:08.673
- That's insane.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.309
What don't you have
in this house?

05:10.311 --> 05:11.943
- Everything has been covered.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.980
<i>- The dude took it
to another level.</i>

05:14.046 --> 05:16.748
<i>There are so many things
that you can just say</i>

05:16.816 --> 05:18.384
he didn't need to do this,
but he did.

05:18.450 --> 05:22.754
<i>And that is like
$5 to $7 million more spent</i>

05:22.822 --> 05:24.455
<i>than your typical builder.</i>

05:24.524 --> 05:26.024
- We've got a 9 screen
video wall, right?

05:26.092 --> 05:28.760
<i>So let's say you want to watch
like nine different games,</i>

05:28.828 --> 05:30.328
<i>and then you've got
the auto gallery.</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:31.564
<i>- I don't know
who's gonna buy this,</i>

05:31.630 --> 05:33.566
<i>but I can tell you
one thing's for sure:</i>

05:33.632 --> 05:34.966
<i>they're wealthy.</i>

05:35.034 --> 05:37.937
They're wealthier
than you and I, for sure.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.373
<i>- The gym, I wanted
to kind of have</i>

05:42.375 --> 05:44.709
<i>an indoor-outdoor flavor,
the gym also.</i>

05:44.711 --> 05:45.911
- Yeah.
- Right? And then--

05:45.913 --> 05:50.916
- Ah, the court of dreams.
- So this is the legends court.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.917
<i>- You know, the movie--
Kevin Costner movie,</i>

05:52.985 --> 05:56.021
"Field of Dreams?"
That's the court of dreams.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.656
Man, epic.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.191
I want to see the primary
bedroom and the restaurant.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.992
- Yep. So you know,
this house actually,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.060
it's got two primary.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.929
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.700
- So how many bedrooms total?
- Seven.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.674
<i>- All right, so this is
the main room, number one.</i>

06:14.740 --> 06:18.444
<i>You got a total of 12 baths.</i>

06:18.510 --> 06:20.078
<i>What I like about this room is</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:22.014
you have your own little
backyard section right here.

06:22.081 --> 06:25.016
<i>- Oh, how cool is that?</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:26.986
- All right, let's go
to the other one.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.891
- [chuckles]
- Right?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.360
<i>- You're overlooking
your kingdom over here.</i>

06:35.428 --> 06:36.428
- And it's still private.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.964
So here's the main bath.
- [laughs]

06:41.167 --> 06:44.169
<i>- You went with the white
and black stone in here.</i>

06:44.236 --> 06:47.572
<i>- That's it.
- I love the walk-through.</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:49.441
<i>- So you got two closets here.</i>

06:49.508 --> 06:51.377
- I love the grays
and the blacks.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.844
<i>- More of a masculine
feeling to it.</i>

06:52.912 --> 06:54.312
<i>- For sure.</i>

06:57.049 --> 06:58.650
So you said
there's a rooftop deck?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.218
<i>- The house comes
with three decks.</i>

07:00.220 --> 07:01.820
<i>A picnic deck,</i>

07:01.822 --> 07:03.855
<i>a putting green deck,</i>

07:03.923 --> 07:05.358
<i>and what I call upstairs,</i>

07:05.424 --> 07:08.393
<i>the hotel lounge rooftop deck.</i>

07:09.629 --> 07:11.596
So what'd you think?
- I see a lot of houses

07:11.664 --> 07:13.598
and I'm not just
trying to sell you here.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
This house, it's off the charts.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.269
- So what are you thinking?

07:17.336 --> 07:18.871
- When I look at this
and I look at comps,

07:18.938 --> 07:20.205
I look at two places.

07:20.272 --> 07:22.441
I look at Brentwood
and I look at Bel Air.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.342
There's been a couple
amazing sales in Bel Air

07:24.410 --> 07:26.612
that will support
the price of this.

07:26.679 --> 07:29.080
So I think if you're sub 50,

07:29.082 --> 07:32.951
this is a serious contender
to anything on the market

07:33.018 --> 07:34.819
between that 40 and 50 range.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.021
- Okay, good.
- So I'm pretty comfortable

07:37.089 --> 07:39.825
with, like, a 48 number.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.493
I don't know the other feedback
that you've gotten

07:41.560 --> 07:42.961
from the other realtors
that you met with,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.029
or what you have in your head,
but that's kinda where I'm at.

07:45.097 --> 07:47.632
- Yeah, I'm kinda--
- A little over 2,000 a foot.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.234
- Kinda hearing the same thing.
- Okay.

07:49.301 --> 07:50.735
- You know, so I'm just gonna--

07:50.737 --> 07:52.503
I have to sit there
and really think about it.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.973
- So you're gonna finish up
your meetings

07:54.039 --> 07:55.907
and then at that point,
you're gonna kinda decide

07:55.909 --> 07:57.977
what direction it goes in?
- Correct.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.913
<i>- Look, a house
at this price point,</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:02.981
I get it, he's not just
gonna sit down with me.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.851
He's gonna meet with
all the top superstars

08:05.918 --> 08:08.487
as far as agents in Los Angeles.

08:08.555 --> 08:12.257
I'm nervous.
My competition is top-notch.

08:12.324 --> 08:15.260
I'm your guy, man.
I hustle nonstop, 24/7.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.929
We've never worked together.
This could be magic.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.465
I'm just saying.
- That's why you're here, man.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.065
I like the suit
and everything, but--

08:21.067 --> 08:22.802
- I knew I had to come--
Come correct

08:22.868 --> 08:24.636
'cause you and your fashion.
- [chuckles]

08:25.872 --> 08:26.939
<i>- Coming up.</i>

08:27.006 --> 08:28.541
- Gleb is on
"Dancing with the Stars".

08:28.607 --> 08:30.943
<i>He and his wife
are selling their house.</i>

08:31.010 --> 08:33.545
So I popped over there and well,

08:33.612 --> 08:34.814
the tenant trashed the place.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.750
So I have ten days
to get it ready for market.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.689

09:27.232 --> 09:28.633
<i>We promised our client</i>

09:28.635 --> 09:30.102

09:39.311 --> 09:42.581
<i>There's limestone floors,
there's retracting windows,</i>

09:42.648 --> 09:44.216
<i>floor-to-ceiling walls of glass.</i>

of great showing so far,</i>

10:00.167 --> 10:02.867

a ton of action.</i>

10:02.869 --> 10:04.102
- They're overseas at the moment

10:04.170 --> 10:05.169
but they're looking for a home

10:05.237 --> 10:06.604
specifically in the Birds.
- Yeah.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.172
- They're looking for
some vacation homes.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.175
They're also looking for some
primary homes as well.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.577
- Fantastic, good.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.112
<i>So now we're gonna do
a more intimate dinner</i>

10:14.180 --> 10:17.916
and really hone in
on those top agents and buyers

10:17.918 --> 10:19.784
and get everybody in
at the same time.

10:19.852 --> 10:20.885
What we gonna do?

10:20.887 --> 10:22.854
- James, I happen to be
a really good cook.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.189
- Seriously,
what are we gonna do?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.123
- What do you mean?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.192
Have you seen--
I grill every single week.

10:27.259 --> 10:29.661
- You grill. You're not a cook.
- Yeah, he grills.

10:29.728 --> 10:32.063
It's not a cookout,
it's a $30 million listing.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.332
You gotta do,
like, a proper thing.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.334
Maybe a three-course
sit-down meal.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.003
I think we get
10, 12 agents max.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.005
Keep it exclusive
and we do something

10:41.007 --> 10:42.808
really, like, high-end.

10:42.875 --> 10:46.645
We gotta cater this party.
- But we do that every time.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.280
- And it works and it's great.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.348
- I think maybe it would
work in our favor

10:50.416 --> 10:53.218
just to have it so that it
feels more like a home.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.785
Listen, if I was walking
into this house

10:54.854 --> 10:57.355
and I see the normal trays
and the canapés

10:57.423 --> 10:59.824
and the champagne,
it's the same thing.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.826
Beautiful house,
but to get past all the staging

11:01.828 --> 11:03.695
and the fact that
it hasn't been lived in,

11:03.762 --> 11:05.296
we make it feel that
they're coming to a home

11:05.298 --> 11:06.697
for a home-cooked dinner.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.167
<i>If I wasn't in real estate,</i>

11:08.233 --> 11:10.101
I'd be very tempted
to be a chef.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.637
<i>And I love it.</i>

11:11.704 --> 11:14.974
<i>I barbecue all the time.
I could chop onions.</i>

11:15.040 --> 11:17.909
I take it very seriously
because I love my food.

11:17.977 --> 11:21.113
- So how about
we combine those both ideas?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.248
We've had it before
where you have the meal,

11:23.315 --> 11:26.517
it's like a chef's meal
and they send it all to you

11:26.519 --> 11:28.319
and all you have to do
is just finish it off.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.988
Like, ten minutes in the pan...
- Oh, we had a great night!

11:31.056 --> 11:32.191
- Or five minutes in the oven.

11:32.257 --> 11:33.458
- Oh, the service
is unbelievable.

11:33.525 --> 11:35.260
So they bring
everything in boxes.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.061
They bring the butter,
the olive oil,

11:37.063 --> 11:40.198
the salt, the pepper.
It's, like, top of the line.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.467
- It's foolproof.
You can't go wrong.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.202
- Perfect. I love that idea.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.804
I just think it's
a little bit different

11:45.871 --> 11:48.206
and it just doesn't feel like
all the other open houses.

11:48.274 --> 11:52.210
- So what are we thinking?
Agents 10, 12 max?

11:52.278 --> 11:54.780
- Max, but remember
there are only a few agents

11:54.846 --> 11:57.148
that have buyers of this caliber

11:57.216 --> 11:58.717
and like, listen, I know Fredrik

11:58.785 --> 12:01.286
is working in the Hills
right now with several buyers

12:01.353 --> 12:03.288
so I think he should
definitely be included.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.855

12:04.924 --> 12:06.925
I haven't spoken to him since

12:06.992 --> 12:09.894
the day we went to his house.
- Yes, my one outing.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.997
- Yeah, your one outing.
Sorry about that.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.765
We said to you,
keep confidential.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.368
But Fredrik, new in L.A.
$14 million deal,

12:17.436 --> 12:19.504
thinks he's gonna go around
screaming about it

12:19.506 --> 12:21.973
from the top of his voice
to try and get other listings.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.275
You're never getting
a deal from us again.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.844
I mean, I'm over it,

12:25.911 --> 12:27.779

he'll even come?

12:27.846 --> 12:29.181
- He probably
has a buyer for it.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.449
He is absolutely gonna come.
It's all good.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.583
- I don't mind. I'll call him.

12:32.651 --> 12:35.253
- Who doesn't like a nice meal
in a $30 million house?

12:35.255 --> 12:38.189
- Well, if he knew it was
cooked by us, maybe he'd pass.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.941
<i>We got a wet steam room.</i>

26:17.008 --> 26:19.210
<i>You have a dry sauna
with a Himalayan salt wall.</i>

26:19.277 --> 26:20.744
<i>- It's incredible.</i>

26:20.746 --> 26:22.279
- In here--
Check this hidden door out.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.715
After you.
This is the chef's kitchen.

26:24.782 --> 26:26.551
And what is great--

26:26.618 --> 26:27.585
- Oh, you don't want
to hire that chef.

26:27.653 --> 26:30.921
- I--by the way,
I am so, so sorry about this.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.690
[laughter]

26:32.757 --> 26:36.360
But you have this huge space.
So you do all the prep here

26:36.362 --> 26:38.095
<i>and then you have
the dumbwaiter.</i>

26:38.163 --> 26:40.230
So everything goes into this,

26:40.298 --> 26:42.699
sends right upstairs
to the show kitchen.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.035
- So we got four bedrooms
downstairs, right?

26:45.103 --> 26:48.139
<i>Two on this side,
two on this side.</i>

26:48.141 --> 26:49.674
<i>- How long were
they building this?</i>

26:49.740 --> 26:52.376
<i>- Four and a half years.
- When was it finished?</i>

26:52.443 --> 26:55.179
- Literally, weeks ago.
- Okay.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.714
- Weren't you working
with someone?

26:56.781 --> 26:58.448
- The French guy?
- Yes, that was it.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.184
- This would be, like,
right up his alley,

27:00.251 --> 27:01.985
as far as the vibe.

27:02.053 --> 27:03.121
- Definitely, definitely
bring him in.

27:04.722 --> 27:08.792
- We feel like 29.995
is a good number.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.595
We're at 2,600 a foot.

27:10.662 --> 27:11.796
- Where are the comps
in the area like?

27:11.863 --> 27:13.997
- Anywhere, really up
from 2,000 a foot.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.266
And we took into account
the two sales on Robin.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.404
They closed at what was it?
76 million--

27:19.470 --> 27:21.471
- For the two properties, yeah.
- Combined.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.675
There's one that just closed
for 26 million.

27:24.742 --> 27:25.942
- Kid-wise, you're not gonna--

27:26.010 --> 27:27.144
You're not gonna
have any family.

27:27.212 --> 27:29.212
It's not the most kid-friendly,
you know, a kid might slip

27:29.280 --> 27:31.416
in that little pond thing
on the way out and drown.

27:31.482 --> 27:34.752
- Guys, how many times
have all of as agents said

27:34.819 --> 27:37.354
the house isn't for a family
and a family buys the house?

27:37.356 --> 27:40.023
- Yeah, of course.
- You guys good for drinks?

27:40.091 --> 27:42.059
- I could do with a top-up.
- Okie-dokie.

27:43.961 --> 27:44.962
- Who would like a refill?

27:44.964 --> 27:46.363
- Will you just top me off?
- Just got one.

27:46.431 --> 27:48.099
- Finish it.
Let's keep going, guys.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.266
- Hi.
- Chugging it.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.968
- Fredrik.
- Sorry for being late.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.102
- I'm glad you made it.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.171
- Did I miss dinner,
it looks like?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.507
- No, there was no dinner
to be missed, man.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.042
- Thank you for coming.
It's very nice to see you.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.244
- Good to see you.
- How are you doing?

28:00.311 --> 28:01.879
- I'm good. I just want to ask

28:01.946 --> 28:03.180
maybe the guests signed--

28:03.248 --> 28:05.382
Did you sign a confidentiality
agreement before you got here?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.317
Do I need--no, honestly?
Do I need to sign an NDA?

28:07.385 --> 28:09.719
Because I might tell someone
that I've been here.

28:09.721 --> 28:12.055
- Dude, we'll let you know when
we need you to keep it quiet

28:12.057 --> 28:13.458
and then we'll know
that you won't keep it quiet.

28:13.524 --> 28:15.192
- It sounds like
a backstory there.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.693
- Yeah.
- Backstory, yeah.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.962
- Fredrik, one thing,
just keep it confidential.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.197
Hugely important for our client.

28:20.264 --> 28:21.365
- Why? So he doesn't
change his mind.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.200
- Aren't you doing something
with Fredrik right now

28:23.268 --> 28:25.402
on Corsica?
- Are you ----ing kidding me?

28:25.470 --> 28:27.472
- Wait, are you really upset?
For real?

28:27.538 --> 28:29.273
- You've been talking to
other people, developers.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.174
We've been screamed at
by our client.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.209
You don't know
how to shut your mouth

28:32.211 --> 28:34.344
in this ----ing deal. No.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.013
<i>Clearly, he thinks
it's a big joke still.</i>

28:37.081 --> 28:40.884
But at this point,
I'm able to just laugh it off

28:40.886 --> 28:43.153
and take it for what it is.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.224
Let's go see the house.
Guys, I'll be right back.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.293
So let me show you
the primary suite--

28:50.361 --> 28:53.530
All Venetian plaster
- Is that retractable?

28:53.532 --> 28:55.500
- Retractable roof.

28:55.566 --> 28:58.301
60 foot with Sage
dimmable glass. I'll stop then.

28:58.369 --> 29:00.170
- Looks like "Star Wars."
- Look at this primary.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.372
It's absolutely stunning.
- Okay.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.307
- Big views from the bed.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.977
- So beautiful.
- 29.995

29:06.979 --> 29:08.445
I think ultimately
we're gonna sell it.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.980
- Of course
you're gonna sell it.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.516
We are gonna sell it.
- We are gonna sell it.

29:11.582 --> 29:14.050
- This is just like beyond.

29:14.118 --> 29:16.253
And look at this, this is crazy!

29:16.320 --> 29:17.787
- Great to see you, David.
- Nice to see you, David.

29:17.789 --> 29:18.922
Thank you.
- All right, guys.

29:18.990 --> 29:20.023
- Thanks for the tour.
It's a great home.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.259
- Have a lovely evening.
- Bye.

29:22.059 --> 29:24.195
- Can I say something?
- Please.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.197
- I do really respect you.
I am, you know,

29:26.264 --> 29:29.432
sorry about the situation
at Corsica.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.202
Can we put it behind us?

29:31.269 --> 29:33.270
- How did you--
First and foremost,

29:33.338 --> 29:34.472
you know, I like you a lot.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.207
And we were pumped
about doing the--

29:36.274 --> 29:37.975
- It's true, Fredrik.
- Right?

29:38.042 --> 29:39.209
- Yeah.
- So we wish you

29:39.277 --> 29:41.012
nothing but success here.
Seriously.

29:41.078 --> 29:42.145
- Thank you.
- Of course.

29:42.213 --> 29:44.281
- I wish I could say
the same about me and Altman,

29:44.348 --> 29:46.217
but it doesn't matter.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.617
- What happened?
- No, go on.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.419
- You know, these rankings.

29:49.487 --> 29:50.487
- Real trends, yes.

29:50.555 --> 29:53.089
- Companies have rankings.
There's the real trends.

29:53.157 --> 29:55.960
Listen, I was chasing them
for many, many years,

29:56.027 --> 29:58.161
but like four
or five years back,

29:58.229 --> 30:00.230
we pulled ourselves
off the rankings, right?

30:00.298 --> 30:01.799
- Why did you
pull out the rankings?

30:01.867 --> 30:03.500
- [inaudible] forced us to do it

30:03.568 --> 30:05.169
because I wanted to grow
in many states

30:05.236 --> 30:06.436
and be a lot of people.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.371
The owner of Douglas Elliman

30:08.439 --> 30:11.107
has a company-wide rule

30:11.175 --> 30:14.044
that if you're gonna be on
the rankings with these teams,

30:14.111 --> 30:17.114
that we are, you can't be above
a certain number.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.282
It used to be 10 then
it changed to 15.

30:19.350 --> 30:23.587
I am today or we are 86 people,
which I think is fine

30:23.589 --> 30:26.590
because you can't compare
86 people with 10 people.

30:26.592 --> 30:27.657
Doesn't make any sense.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.193
Altman's perspective is this.

30:30.261 --> 30:32.462
He becomes number one
at the company.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.998
So what he's really pissed is
is that Julia

30:35.066 --> 30:36.533
who runs the company,
as you know,

30:36.601 --> 30:39.536
called PR
and ask for recognition

30:39.538 --> 30:41.606
because we have certain
developers, you know, like--

30:41.672 --> 30:42.906
- Yeah, of course.

30:42.974 --> 30:44.608
- Asking us,
where are your team?

30:44.610 --> 30:46.277
Are you not doing real estate?
Did you move to LA?

30:46.344 --> 30:47.478
Are you in Cali--
Are you in New York?

30:47.545 --> 30:50.047
Like, we just wanted
recognition from the company.

30:50.114 --> 30:51.916
- But what's the issue.
I don't understand.

30:51.982 --> 30:54.651
- The issue is that the Icon
award happened to come out

30:54.719 --> 30:56.486
next to his number one award.

30:56.554 --> 31:00.057
So he thinks I'm here
to steal his big thunder.

31:00.124 --> 31:01.859
- Did you do it intentionally?
- No.

31:01.927 --> 31:02.893
- So what's the problem?

31:02.960 --> 31:04.829
- You're talking like
we don't know Altman.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.831
<i>- Altman has completely
overreacted,</i>

31:06.898 --> 31:08.531
<i>blown it out of proportion</i>

31:08.533 --> 31:10.901
and twisted everything around,

31:10.968 --> 31:13.570
and made this award
something that it's not.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.239
- I had heard and confirmed
some things

31:16.241 --> 31:18.442
that your CEO, Julia...
- Okay.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.077
- Called the executives.

31:20.144 --> 31:22.112
She asked for an award
for you guys.

31:22.179 --> 31:24.514
- Yes, I wanted some
sort of like this mention

31:24.582 --> 31:26.517
that we are in the company.

31:26.584 --> 31:29.586
It is refreshing
to talk to the Brit,

31:29.588 --> 31:33.189
who's known him in that
market of L.A. for so long,

31:33.257 --> 31:35.325
and hopefully,
we can be friends again.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.061
- To me, I think
the whole thing's pathetic.

31:37.128 --> 31:39.196
- That's ridiculous.
- It is pathetic.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.331
- We are in the rankings.
We take it seriously,

31:41.333 --> 31:42.532
but if there's someone else

31:42.534 --> 31:44.033
that comes ahead of us
in the agency,

31:44.102 --> 31:45.535
you celebrate other
people's success.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.672
- Let me as you,
why are you in the rankings?

31:47.738 --> 31:49.673
For vanity or for clients?
- Both.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.342
Vanity, because
we're celebrating our success.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.610
Why shouldn't we?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.679
And our clients
should see our success.

31:55.746 --> 31:57.547
- Guys, we have to laugh at it.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.483
- It's ridiculous.
- Come on. I love you, guys.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.685
- It's good to see you, man.
Congratulations again.

32:01.752 --> 32:03.587
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, icon.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.489
- Iconic.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.226

32:08.292 --> 32:10.760
- We're both sort of
moving on with our lives.

32:10.828 --> 32:12.630
3.3? What do you think?

32:12.697 --> 32:14.297
- 3.5?
- 3.5.

maybe 25 grand there

32:55.707 --> 32:58.409

made an investment

32:58.476 --> 33:00.109
in staging a house

I was nervous it wouldn't

33:07.719 --> 33:10.054

- Yes?

33:10.120 --> 33:13.523

<i>We did all the grass.</i>

34:26.430 --> 34:29.499
So now it feels
so much more green.

34:29.567 --> 34:32.101
<i>- I mean, the tenant really
killed the area before.</i>

34:32.103 --> 34:34.271
Remember like,
it was just so messy.

34:34.338 --> 34:35.773
<i>- I remember.
Look at the whole hillside.</i>

34:35.840 --> 34:39.742
So now we have great succulents
planted everywhere.

34:39.810 --> 34:42.380
<i>- Beautiful.
- I love it.</i>

34:42.446 --> 34:45.115
- So in here we decided to do--

34:45.182 --> 34:47.851
Since we have so many bedrooms
in this house,

34:47.853 --> 34:50.587
<i>we opted to stage this
as an office.</i>

34:50.589 --> 34:51.488
<i>- Beautiful.</i>

34:51.490 --> 34:54.324
<i>- And then went ahead
and staged this.</i>

34:54.391 --> 34:55.725
- It used to be
our kid's bedroom.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.760
- Right.
And we put a larger bed in here

34:57.828 --> 35:00.196
so that people
could see this room

35:00.264 --> 35:01.365
is actually
larger than it feels.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.666
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.233
- Are you guys ready to see
the primary suite?

35:04.302 --> 35:07.904
- So ready.
- It's so different.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.273
- Ooh!

35:09.340 --> 35:13.410
- Like it's absolutely
airy, beautiful.

35:13.412 --> 35:17.347
Huge, like, sleeping area
with a great king-size bed.

35:17.415 --> 35:19.916
And then we did a full
seating area down here.

35:19.918 --> 35:23.486
- Yeah. And I love how
you take--took down that light.

35:23.488 --> 35:27.557
I remember I used to
just like get off my bed--

35:27.559 --> 35:30.560
- I know.
- Bang.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.830
<i>- I've done a lot of work</i>

35:32.897 --> 35:35.099
with couples
going through a divorce.

35:35.166 --> 35:37.233
It's like one of the first
and their biggest asset

35:37.301 --> 35:38.635
that they obviously
have to work out

35:38.637 --> 35:40.571
prior to finalizing a divorce.

35:40.638 --> 35:44.207
<i>So I can't believe that
I haven't had to separate them</i>

35:44.209 --> 35:46.509
one time during this entire deal

35:46.577 --> 35:49.579
because they've been able
to navigate this like adults,

35:49.581 --> 35:50.714
which is rare.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.716
So, what do you guys think?

35:52.783 --> 35:55.785
- I honestly love it.
I think it's beautiful.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.320
It's a huge transformation.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.090
Thank you so much, Tracy.
I really appreciate it.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.257
- So do you feel like
it was worth it?

36:01.325 --> 36:04.427
Because when I first
came into the house with Gina,

36:04.429 --> 36:08.365
the way that it looked.
It was a 2.9 house.

36:08.432 --> 36:11.668
And now that $50,000 investment

36:11.736 --> 36:14.871
absolutely has put a three
in front of it for me.

36:14.939 --> 36:19.143
- Oh, 100%. I think 50k
and hopefully, we can get--

36:19.210 --> 36:21.277
- 3.5?
- $3.5.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.547
- [laughs]
Well, that's a little much,

36:23.614 --> 36:25.815
but I--let's--let's talk
about this.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.350
If we were new construction,

36:27.418 --> 36:29.619
then I think we could push
the envelope a little bit.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.189
- So $3.3, maybe?

36:32.257 --> 36:36.626
- I think we have the ability
to potentially achieve 3.3,

36:36.694 --> 36:38.395
but I also want to keep in mind

36:38.462 --> 36:40.229
that we have staging to pay for.

36:40.231 --> 36:41.831
That's a monthly cost.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.768
I want to make sure this trades
in the first 30 days,

36:44.835 --> 36:46.904
if not in the first two weeks.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.872
I'm thinking $3,195,000

36:49.940 --> 36:52.910
because I think that will get a
lot of bodies through the door

36:52.977 --> 36:55.446
and potentially
even engage a multiple.

36:55.512 --> 36:56.579
<i>In this neighborhood,</i>

36:56.581 --> 36:58.516
<i>the stuff that's going
in the higher threes,</i>

36:58.582 --> 37:01.251
<i>3.7, 3.8 and even 4 million,</i>

37:01.318 --> 37:02.852
<i>are brand new construction.</i>

37:02.854 --> 37:06.290
To even get to 3.5,
we have the square footage,

37:06.356 --> 37:07.357
but we have an older home

37:07.359 --> 37:09.793
<i>that's been moderately
updated over the years</i>

37:09.860 --> 37:12.895
and it's just not going
to achieve that number.

37:12.963 --> 37:15.332
- I personally want to sell it
as fast as possible.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.601
So we can all move on forward.
- Yeah.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.603
I mean, listen,
we're both sort of

37:20.605 --> 37:22.605
moving on with our lives,
you know,

37:22.673 --> 37:25.475
and we want to sell it
as fast as possible

37:25.543 --> 37:28.377
because we still want
to save money on the mortgage

37:28.446 --> 37:30.379
and kind of staging
and all of that.

37:30.448 --> 37:31.881
So what do you think?

37:31.883 --> 37:34.284
- I think, yes. Let's go ahead.

37:34.286 --> 37:39.489
- Deal. 3,195, let's do it.
- Thank you for trusting me.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.558
And you know, if I do sell it
in the first 30 days

37:42.626 --> 37:43.693
or damn close to ask,

37:43.695 --> 37:45.496
perhaps, you know,

37:45.562 --> 37:46.896
you could throw my name
in the hat

37:46.898 --> 37:47.830
for the
"Dancing with the Stars" --

37:47.898 --> 37:49.432
- And I'll give you--
- 45--

37:49.434 --> 37:50.834
- And I'll give you
free dance lessons.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.935
I'll do a little--
A little salsa.

37:53.003 --> 37:54.704
- Okay.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.906
- One and two
and three and four.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.508
And here we go.

37:58.575 --> 38:01.711
Sell the house, da-da-da,
and little pivot,

38:01.713 --> 38:05.048
pivot, pivot, and a dip. Whoo!
- Whoo!

38:05.050 --> 38:06.783
- That's actual choreography.
- Okay.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.852
- Wow, Elena, I think we need
some work on that.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.454
- I think I need to work
on choreography

38:11.456 --> 38:15.558
a little bit to make it,
you know--

38:15.626 --> 38:16.660
<i>- Coming up.</i>

38:16.727 --> 38:17.894
- We've got
an international buyer

38:17.961 --> 38:20.530
that's coming in at 28 million.

38:20.597 --> 38:22.598

we were talking about 32.</i>

38:22.666 --> 38:24.801
<i>And you guys wanted to be at 30.</i>

38:24.868 --> 38:26.569
- A bird in the hand
though, Mau.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.571

- Hi, David. How are you?

38:40.617 --> 38:42.753
- I'm very well, indeed.
- Why is that?

38:42.820 --> 38:46.022
- Because we'd got
a $28 million offer

38:46.090 --> 38:49.959
on Nightingale, all cash.
- Oh, my God. That's huge.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.829

<i>James and I have done

38:54.699 --> 38:55.765
<i>One of them, in particular,</i>

38:55.833 --> 38:57.500
<i>was with a broker
called Vincent,</i>

38:57.502 --> 38:58.901
<i>who had an international client</i>

38:58.969 --> 39:01.771
<i>who we showed the house to
through Zoom.</i>

39:01.839 --> 39:03.906
Believe it or not,
he wrote an offer.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.108
The only thing is

39:05.175 --> 39:08.779
they can't commit to anything
before a three-month close.

39:08.846 --> 39:12.715
So yes, it's $28 million,
but it's a three-month close.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.418
- Let's ----ing go.

39:14.484 --> 39:15.651
Tell me you saw the offer.

39:15.719 --> 39:16.853
- I assume you checked
your email.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.588
- You like that?
- I like that.

39:18.655 --> 39:19.756
- Guys, that's a deal.

39:19.823 --> 39:21.524
- I knew you knew.
- What'd you mean?

39:21.592 --> 39:23.126
- Georji said
"You think James knows?"

39:23.128 --> 39:24.460
I said he checks
his emails every Friday.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.596
- Guys, I'm like a psychopath.

39:25.662 --> 39:27.497
We all know this.

39:27.564 --> 39:28.998
I bet you saw it
before I bloody saw it.

39:29.066 --> 39:30.199
- Maybe in nanoseconds.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.670
- Great buyer except the
90-day close is concerning.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.872
I mean, do we call
Vinny and just like,

39:35.940 --> 39:38.007
see if they're willing
to come up or--

39:38.075 --> 39:39.675
- Yeah.
- Push it one last time.

39:39.743 --> 39:42.579
- Well, try and get him up
and to close sooner, right?

39:42.646 --> 39:44.415
[line ringing]
I know he was pretty firm

39:44.481 --> 39:47.417
last time around, but--

39:47.484 --> 39:49.053
[line ringing]
<i>- Hey, James.</i>

39:49.119 --> 39:52.121
- Hey, Vincent.
James and David. How are you?

39:52.123 --> 39:53.423
- So here's the deal.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.558
I need you to go back
to the client

39:55.626 --> 39:57.361
and push the number,
push the term.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.496
Anything you can do
to strengthen the term

39:59.563 --> 40:00.930
so we can get this deal done.

40:06.770 --> 40:08.038
- But Vinny, quick question,

40:08.105 --> 40:09.639
since its all cash, right?

40:09.707 --> 40:13.643
Why do you absolutely
need this 90 days because

40:13.711 --> 40:15.579
they may lose the house,
otherwise.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.587
- (BLEEP).

40:28.792 --> 40:30.159
- We'll be in touch
if anything changes

40:30.227 --> 40:31.929
on our side.
We appreciate the offer.

40:31.995 --> 40:33.463
- Thanks, Vince.

40:34.097 --> 40:36.132
- All right, all right.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.535
We have worked so hard
on showing this property

40:39.603 --> 40:41.737
<i>over the last six weeks</i>

40:41.805 --> 40:45.208
that it would be devastating
if it fell through.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.944
I don't know if we're just
too far apart, generally.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.146
I don't know.
But let's call him.

40:50.214 --> 40:53.550
We know that Mauricio
isn't going to be thrilled

40:53.617 --> 40:55.685
about the terms of this offer,

40:55.687 --> 40:59.022
but it's our job to put forward
the most compelling argument

40:59.089 --> 41:01.157
as to why this is an offer

41:01.225 --> 41:03.159
they should very
seriously consider.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.595
- Mau, how are you?
<i>- Hey, how's it going?</i>

41:05.663 --> 41:08.164
- Good. Clearly, we need
to sort our lives out.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.467
So we have your background,
not this one.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.969
- What's wrong with me?
- Where the hell are you?

41:13.037 --> 41:15.572
- I am in Punta Mita.
- Lucky bugger.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.974
Well, we got to keep you
for two minutes,

41:18.042 --> 41:19.976
but I think
it's a great two minutes.

41:20.044 --> 41:23.513
We've got an international
buyer that's put pen to paper.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.781
They're coming in at 28 million.

41:25.849 --> 41:29.919
However, they do need
a three month close.

41:29.921 --> 41:33.589
So they're asking for 90 days
to see it from start to finish,

41:33.591 --> 41:37.627
but we believe
they will get the deal done.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.997
<i>- I don't think so, guys.</i>

41:40.063 --> 41:41.931
<i>First of all,
three months is a long time</i>

41:41.933 --> 41:43.600
<i>and a lot can happen.</i>

41:43.602 --> 41:46.703
<i>And you're also $2 million
under the asking.</i>

41:46.770 --> 41:48.071
<i>- A three-month close</i>

41:48.073 --> 41:51.742
<i>is three times the length
of a standard close.</i>

41:51.808 --> 41:53.676
Sellers don't typically like it

41:53.744 --> 41:56.580
because the longer
the time goes by,

41:56.646 --> 41:59.282
the less likely the deal
is to close in their mind.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.017
They want certainty

42:01.084 --> 42:02.885
and they want it
as soon as possible.

42:02.887 --> 42:05.121
<i>We've done two deals this year,</i>

42:05.188 --> 42:07.957
one for 22
and one for 16 million

42:08.025 --> 42:09.559
with international clients

42:09.626 --> 42:11.628
that have bought
through FaceTime.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.163
Like there is no doubt
this guy closes.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.165
He just needs the 90 days
to see it through

42:16.233 --> 42:17.833
the finish line
because they can't be here.

42:17.901 --> 42:19.969
<i>- Guys, remember when
we were doing the listing,</i>

42:20.037 --> 42:21.304
<i>I wanted to be over 30.</i>

42:21.306 --> 42:24.907
<i>We were talking about 32 and
you guys wanted to be at 30.</i>

42:24.909 --> 42:28.545
<i>We are not just 2 million
under the 30,</i>

42:28.613 --> 42:30.146
<i>we're really at least
4 million under</i>

42:30.148 --> 42:33.116
<i>where I want it to be
and the three-month close.</i>

42:33.118 --> 42:35.117
<i>So I think we can
definitely do better.</i>

42:35.185 --> 42:36.553
<i>And likely even get more.</i>

42:36.621 --> 42:40.123
- Sometimes we've seen
that the first offer

42:40.125 --> 42:41.858
ends up being the best offer.

42:41.860 --> 42:42.858
I don't want to put
a downer on it,

42:42.926 --> 42:43.726
but I just want to make sure

42:43.794 --> 42:45.661
that we're really
thinking this through.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.196
<i>- I don't like this deal.</i>

42:47.198 --> 42:48.798
- A bird in the hand
though, Mau.

42:48.865 --> 42:50.199
You know, think about it.

42:50.267 --> 42:51.867
30, 45 days from now,

42:51.935 --> 42:53.736
we don't bring you guys
another offer

42:53.738 --> 42:56.238
and we have 30,
45 days from closing.

42:56.306 --> 42:57.674
You know--
<i>- You know how we change that?</i>

42:57.741 --> 43:00.709
<i>You bring an offer
in the next 30, 45 days.</i>

43:00.778 --> 43:03.946
<i>- On one hand, your first
offer can often be your best,</i>

43:04.014 --> 43:06.015
<i>but on the other,
in the eyes of the seller,</i>

43:06.083 --> 43:08.017
your first offer comes too quick

43:08.019 --> 43:09.953
<i>and they think
they can get more.</i>

43:10.020 --> 43:13.623
<i>These trophy properties
can take a long time to sell.</i>

43:13.690 --> 43:14.892
And I'm so bummed out right now

43:14.958 --> 43:17.561
because I feel like this is
a great deal that would close.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.096
<i>- Let's just get to work,
guys. I know you can sell it.</i>

43:20.164 --> 43:21.832
- We hear you loud and clear

43:21.898 --> 43:25.201
and we're gonna get
back to work.

43:25.203 --> 43:27.137
<i>Next time on the season finale</i>

43:27.204 --> 43:28.905
<i>of "Million Dollar
Listing Los Angeles."</i>

43:28.973 --> 43:32.008
<i>- What year was this built?
- 1921.</i>

43:32.010 --> 43:33.710
Its rumored Howard Hughes
lived here.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.812
Charlie Chaplin, Johnny Depp,
Jimmy Hendrix.

43:35.814 --> 43:37.913
- I'm getting dizzy.
I need to hold on to something.

43:37.981 --> 43:40.316
- I think it's worth
$100 million.

43:40.384 --> 43:41.952
- Wait, what did you say?

43:42.018 --> 43:43.386
- Start with
the right foot back,

43:43.388 --> 43:46.322
turn onto the arm.
- Slow down a little, I'm old.

43:46.390 --> 43:49.325
- I'm just waiting
for those offers. Let's go.

43:49.327 --> 43:50.860
- So you've got
the champagne bar,

43:50.927 --> 43:52.028
which leads into the theater.

43:52.095 --> 43:53.396
- Oh, my God.
I love this house.

43:53.398 --> 43:54.397
- Is the price negotiable?

43:54.464 --> 43:56.232
- Well, I say everything
in life is negotiable.

43:56.299 --> 43:57.266
Make me an offer.

43:57.334 --> 44:00.136
- Everybody! I mean--
[high-pitched] Everybody!

44:00.204 --> 44:03.005
<i>I thought the whole industry
was just gonna welcome me</i>

44:03.007 --> 44:06.342
with their arms open
and, oof, was I wrong.

44:06.344 --> 44:08.145
- I actually came here
to support you.

44:08.211 --> 44:09.412
- You, from the very beginning,

44:09.414 --> 44:11.013
did not like that I came here

44:11.015 --> 44:12.249
and you are attacking me

44:12.315 --> 44:14.383
over and over and over again.

44:14.451 --> 44:15.985
- It's shady.
We used to be friends.

44:16.053 --> 44:17.820
That's why
I'm so angry about this.

44:17.888 --> 44:19.221
You know what?
Our relationship,

44:19.289 --> 44:21.224
the last string, it's cut.
