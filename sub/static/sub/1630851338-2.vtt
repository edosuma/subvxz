If your son is a good man,
no harm will come to him.

And sometimes even
a good man must kill.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.224
Do you think
he did it?

06:32.226 --> 06:33.692
He would not do it.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.427
He would not
take a man's life.

I do. Two boys.

them capable of murder?

To introduce my new wife
to the world.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.892
Really, george?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.695
I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.964
I thought you wanted your
sister to begin her new life.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.033
Please, dorothy. Please!

07:48.035 --> 07:51.436

in this room with me forever.

-Mm-hm. It is.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.044

in her back the entire time.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.947

the slightest funny thing

Oh, andrew!

08:23.070 --> 08:25.537
Is this the woman
who saved me?

08:25.606 --> 08:28.205
She is indeed.
Bless her.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.945
So, is he going
to come back?

08:33.981 --> 08:35.213
That's what
I'm counting on.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.148
And you trust him?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.884
I'm hoping he fears
what I'll do to him

08:39.887 --> 08:41.219
More than the falcones.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.825

do about him?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.226
Return him
to his mother.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.462
Hopefully grant him
a normal life.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.232
Are you sure you want
to curse him with that?

09:02.175 --> 09:03.842
As long as
he's safe.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.312
What about you?

What about me?

will come to him, so be it.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.862
I'm sorry, william.

So am I.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.377
All I'm suggesting ladies,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.145
Is that I've seen your work
and you're all as capable

09:41.214 --> 09:42.614
As any man.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.016
And it's not beyond your
capabilities to become doctors.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.618
And, frankly, the profession
would be better served

09:47.654 --> 09:49.287
With more women in it.

be admitted to medical school.

I wouldn't be, either.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.694
No!

09:55.696 --> 09:57.695
Well, with my reccomendation,
you might.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.498

It's andrew.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.866

10:05.472 --> 10:07.872
Good lord! Help him.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.508
Nurse, prep for surgery.
Get a gurney.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.677
You two,
help me with him.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.245
Beatrice:
Will he be all right?

10:21.054 --> 10:24.055
So, when am I
getting my bag back?

10:24.190 --> 10:26.591
Rest assured, ma'am, I'll have
your bag to you in a moment.

Dearly beloved...

10:56.823 --> 10:58.356
Come here!

Georges.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.854
Ah, it's good
to see you sir.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.922
I was afraid some ill
had befallen you.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.657
Oh, I'm fine.
Thank you.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.127
But there is something
I need you to do for me.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.828
That's why I'm here.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.265
Is that your son?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.135
Indeed.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.470
You are a lucky man.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.271
Oh, I would
hardly say that.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.207
Well, the circumstance
in which you find yourself

11:49.276 --> 11:52.143
Is less than fortunate,
but the fact you have a son

11:52.179 --> 11:53.678
Is indeed
a good fortune.

11:53.813 --> 11:56.281
Yes, georges.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.216
So, what is it
you require of me?

11:58.285 --> 12:00.885
You wish me to escort these
two to the train station?

12:00.887 --> 12:03.420
Oh, ah, no, that will
be my responsibility.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.656
I need you to do
something else.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.364
Amelia's behind bars.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.167
Why did you
marry her?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.902
It wasn't a real
marriage, effie.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.905
It was ordained by higgins,
for pete's sake!

12:20.941 --> 12:23.908
And I did it to keep
you safe and you are now.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.309
No, I'm not.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.112
We'll... We'll find dorothy.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.815
Maybe you should go home
and get some rest.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.251
George, perhaps you
should have married her.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.453
In earnest.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.121
Then maybe all
this would be over.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.724
Effie, I don't think
you're thinking straight.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.626
I suppose I'm not.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.563
Ah, constable paul!

12:45.599 --> 12:47.465
Would you escort
miss newsome home?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.466
Maybe stay with her
until I get there?

12:49.503 --> 12:50.401
Of course.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.872
-Let me go! Let me go!
-George.

12:55.742 --> 12:56.941
It's fine.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.077
Drink. You'll feel better.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.614
It's funny.
That's all I did last night.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.148
And I don't.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.450
You slept in
the alley?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.954
If that's where
you found me, yes.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.159
You know
mr. Larkin is dead?

13:17.397 --> 13:18.830
Dead?

13:21.434 --> 13:22.767
Good.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.104
But I did not do it!

13:26.106 --> 13:27.505
I was drinking all night.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.774
Talk to the bartender.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.709
Busy bar.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.178
But with one
japanese man in it.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.414
He'll tell you
where I was.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.019
Eliza:
It wasn't him.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.321
You said you didn't get
a good look at the assailant.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.122
That's true.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.858
So, perhaps I should say
I don't think it was him.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.193
Why?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.729
Well, I only had
a glance at the person,

13:51.798 --> 13:54.399
But he was much
slighter than that man.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.666
You're sure?

13:58.138 --> 13:59.671
No matter what you may
think of jack larkin,

13:59.673 --> 14:01.405
I had a great
affection for him.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.875
If I thought that was
the man who killed him,

14:03.877 --> 14:05.276
I would say so.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.145
All right. Thank you.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.482
-Detective.
-Yes?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.884
I talked to
the owner of the bar.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.752
He said the japanese man was
in there until late last night.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.153
Is he certain?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.288
He had to
throw him out.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.822
That's probably why he
ended up in the alley.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.159
I see. Thank you.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.160
Oh!

14:22.295 --> 14:23.494
Ah, could you escort
miss day home?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.595
Of course.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.533
City morgue.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.704
I don't want to talk to you,
george crabtree.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.375
-You have to.
-No, I don't. Mm-mm.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.976
I hate you.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.913
You took my heart,
and you broke it.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.515
I had no choice.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.250
Ooh! How could you
lead me on like that?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.419
You're certainly not the person
I thought you were.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.955
Well, nor are you.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.191
I should have made you seek
help the first time we met.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.526
Help?
There's nothing wrong with me.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.660
Except you!

14:56.696 --> 14:58.329
You could have taken
what I had to offer.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.599
Everything.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.337
Where's your sister?

15:07.374 --> 15:08.539
How should I know?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.274
Amelia, any assistance
you can give at this point

15:10.277 --> 15:12.076
Can only help your cause.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.413
I'm not telling you.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.383
Crabtree: She didn't do much
to help you, did she?

15:18.518 --> 15:20.951
She sacrificed you
while she made her get away.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.687
Now, where did she go?

15:23.723 --> 15:26.758
♪ oh where, oh, where ♪

15:26.760 --> 15:29.560
♪ will dorothy go? ♪

15:29.696 --> 15:31.729
Amelia.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.198
♪ oh where, ♪

15:34.234 --> 15:37.702
♪ oh, where will she be? ♪

15:39.105 --> 15:42.272
♪ with her hair cut long, ♪

15:44.844 --> 15:49.413
♪ oh, where, oh,
where will she be? ♪

15:59.225 --> 16:00.258
Murdoch:
You like science?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.059
I don't know
what I like.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.195
I haven't been
in school much.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.131
It just looks
interesting.

16:09.869 --> 16:10.968
Wait right here.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.209
You don't
have to worry.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.744
Nobody's following us.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.145
How do you know that?

16:21.280 --> 16:22.613
I've been watching.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.048
I always do.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.918
My mother told me to always
keep my head on a swivel.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.621
Well, hopefully, you won't have
to do that for much longer.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.962
For you, young man.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.231
Really.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.500
Thank you.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.802
You'll be going
on a long journey.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.237
You'll need something
to occupy your mind.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.908
Thank you.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.723
I'm so sorry.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.192
Please. No. No, no.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.128
We did everything we could,

17:11.164 --> 17:13.464
But he began to hemorrhage
and there was no way to stop it.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.400
What am I going to
do without him?

17:24.878 --> 17:27.144
Combine these
two chemicals

17:27.213 --> 17:29.080
For a great surprise.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.884
Uh, but only do
that outdoors.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.424
I would like it very much
if you would come.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.162
As would I.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.897
But I can't.

17:46.032 --> 17:49.400
I have to be certain that you
and your mother are safe first.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.969
What about after
you've done that?

17:52.038 --> 17:54.639
There'll be plenty
of time to discuss it.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.640
I've bought
two tickets.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.243
I will accompany
the boy to new york.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.845
Very good.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.049
I would be
forever grateful

18:05.184 --> 18:07.385
If you would see them
both safely to England.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.419
England?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.524
You'll see to the bill?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.792
Of course.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.460
All right.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.494
You'd best be off.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.533
You'll be brave?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.872
I'll write you
once I do the experiment.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.474
I would very much
like that.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.344
But only once I've told
you it's safe to do so;

18:33.413 --> 18:34.879
Not before.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.280
Okay.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.820
I'm glad I met you,
father.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.490
As am I, son.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.425
As am I.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.377
M sorry, detective.
I'm no closer to an answer.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.446
Have you tried consulting
with dr. Ogden?

19:08.448 --> 19:09.980
I doubt that'll
be necessary.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.648
I think it is,
mrs. Hart.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.519
Lack of knowledge can only
be remedied by asking questions.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.188
In that way your job
is no different than mine.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.990
If you just
give me more time.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.857
I'm sorry,
that's something

19:20.894 --> 19:22.259
I don't currently
have an excess of.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.528
I could request
doctor ogden myself

19:24.664 --> 19:26.197
If you find
the matter unpleasant.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.132
No. I'll do it.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.002
Good.

19:43.749 --> 19:44.949
Detective
murdoch.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.485
Mr. Falcone.

19:48.521 --> 19:52.223
I take it you're enjoying
your time in la belle province?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.625
Mr. Rhodes told me
you had the woman.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.727
Give her to me.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.199
-I don't think so.
-You didn't hear him.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.034
We're here for the woman.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.035
Drop your weapon.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.773
-Take them in, georges.
-With pleasure.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.578
This one, as well.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.047
What do you think
you're doing?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.316
I'm saving your skin,
mr. Rhodes.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.851
Making this
look good, huh?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.254
Yeah. All right. All right.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.990
Yeah, it's good.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.328
I see.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.996
They're called osteons.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.332
Oh, yes!
I remember.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.200
Both human and animal
bones contain them

20:37.237 --> 20:38.803
And in some circumstances,

20:38.805 --> 20:41.471
There's easily
identifiable osteon banding.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.373
In this case,
I'd say almost definitely

20:43.409 --> 20:45.810
This is animal bone.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.013
But they said they cremated
their daughter.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.482
Then they were
likely lying.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.485
My best guess?
This is pig femur.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.219
Thank you, dr. Ogden.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.323
But I do think
I should have known that.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.791
Well, you don't
have as many corpses

21:00.926 --> 21:02.626
Under your belt as I do.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.228
Not yet, anyway.

21:05.531 --> 21:09.032
This was rather a pleasant
diversion, actually.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.901
I lost a patient today.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.903
Oh. I'm sorry.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.905
There was little that could
have been done for him.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.642
I tried. It failed.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.511
[door opens]

21:20.646 --> 21:22.980
Well, have our
questions been answered?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.715
Doctor.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.317
Ogden:
Gentlemen.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.118
Your suspicions
were right, detective.

21:28.154 --> 21:31.388
What we're looking at here is
an extremely charred pig femur.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.389
Huh.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.891
Not human at all, then.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.860
So, the two of them
were lying to you.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.061
So it would seem.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.664
It would also seem their
daughter is indeed alive.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.366
And now her
husband's dead.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.734
Bring them in.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.536
Pressure them into
giving us something useful.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.970
And if they don't?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.639
Charge them with murder.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.609
So, the parent should pay
for the sin of the child.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.146
You better tread
carefully, watts.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.683
Mrs. Hart.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.222
Ah, doctor ogden.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.357
George.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.626
I was wondering if I might
impose on you a moment?

22:08.628 --> 22:10.026
Of course.
What do you need?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.362
I'm hoping you'll have
a word with a suspect

22:12.398 --> 22:13.697
I have in custody.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.100
Certainly.
Who is it?

22:16.169 --> 22:20.303
Until recently,
she was my wife.

22:20.340 --> 22:25.242
Well, that may require
further explanation.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.144
Ah...
Where shall I begin?

22:31.384 --> 22:32.782
Falcone:
So, tell me...

22:32.784 --> 22:36.520
When did it become a crime
to take a train to montreal?

22:36.656 --> 22:38.588
When that trip

22:38.624 --> 22:40.591
Is for the purpose
of committing murder.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.559
Oh, good luck
proving that.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.796
I have testimony that
posits you commissioned

22:45.931 --> 22:48.132
The murder of
anna fulford.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.533
She isn't dead.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.134
No.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.338
But conspiracy to commit
murder is also a crime.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.274
And I have a witness
that any jury

22:57.410 --> 22:59.343
Would be compelled
to believe.

22:59.478 --> 23:03.747
If you go ahead with this,
you're signing the death warrant

23:03.816 --> 23:07.284
For all of those you
hold near and dear.

23:07.286 --> 23:10.086
I'm not afraid of you.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.691
Guard!

23:13.826 --> 23:15.192
It isn't me
you should be afraid of.

23:17.663 --> 23:20.164
The reach
of the black hand

23:20.166 --> 23:22.499
Extends far beyond
these walls.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.468
Good day,
mr. Falcone.

23:24.537 --> 23:28.305
You're risking a lot

23:28.307 --> 23:29.774
For a bastard son.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.794
Amelia.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.399
Who are you?

23:55.534 --> 23:58.735
My name is
dr. Julia ogden.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.737
That's funny.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.941
-What is?
-A lady doctor.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.143
If we're playing pretend,

24:06.212 --> 24:09.246
Then I'm princess
amelia ernst.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.283
Ogden:
Not mrs. George crabtree?

24:12.285 --> 24:13.683
Now, that's not funny.

24:13.719 --> 24:17.687
I was supposed to be
mrs. George crabtree

24:17.723 --> 24:20.424
But he deceived me.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.096
But he will
love me someday.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.731
Why do you
believe that?

24:30.102 --> 24:31.502
When he sees
the error of his ways,

24:31.637 --> 24:33.503
He will come back to me.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.773
And if he doesn't
come back to me,

24:35.775 --> 24:38.875
Then he's in for it.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.045
We'll see to that.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.781
-We'll?
-Mm. Uh-hm.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.018
Dorothy and I.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.089
Fool us once,
shame on you.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.598
What makes you think
that george is the one?

25:03.302 --> 25:04.868
Because I read
his words.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.105
He is my soulmate.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.641
We are destined
to be together.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.342
One way or another.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.279
What do you
mean by that?

25:16.315 --> 25:19.883
It means

25:19.952 --> 25:22.252
There are more worlds
than this one.

25:25.525 --> 25:29.225
And I don't care which one
we are together in.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.569
You planning on
releasing me anytime soon?

25:39.705 --> 25:42.372
I will. Not just yet.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.110
I'm uh...

25:46.245 --> 25:48.178
Kind of a sitting
duck in here.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.846
Never know
who's going to come

25:49.882 --> 25:51.848
Walking through
those cell doors.

25:51.918 --> 25:55.853
Patience, mr. Rhodes.
Patience.

26:04.597 --> 26:08.065
You had no right to disturb
my daughter's remains.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.200
That is a pig bone, sir.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.736
You did not cremate
your daughter.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.873
In fact, I believe
she's very much alive.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.008
That's not true.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.743
I'm afraid it is.

26:19.878 --> 26:21.211
A scientific test
has proven that bone

26:21.247 --> 26:24.248
To be animal in nature
and, as the inspector said,

26:24.383 --> 26:26.684
Most likely a pig.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.420
What was the nature
of your ruse?

26:29.555 --> 26:32.822
Our daughter is dead,
and that man killed her.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.525
And the woman before her.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.394
He is the guilty man.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.930
Did you know about this?

26:44.337 --> 26:47.070
So, is this how
you want to play it?

26:49.475 --> 26:51.508
Right, then.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.776
All three of you
are charged

26:52.911 --> 26:54.144
With the murder
of mr. Jack larkin.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.183
You had all better
think carefully

26:59.318 --> 27:00.784
About what you are doing.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.890
I would like to make
a formal statement

27:06.959 --> 27:09.860
Saying that station house four
have entered formal charges

27:09.929 --> 27:12.529
Against mr. Hakuri
and mrs. Yua nakamura

27:12.665 --> 27:14.665
In the murder
of mr. Jack larkin.

27:14.667 --> 27:18.002
Yes. Thank you.
Goodbye.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.003
What are you doing?

27:20.006 --> 27:23.006
I'm letting the press know
that we've done our job.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.541
Formally?

27:31.617 --> 27:33.683
Amelia's not well, george.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.620
She should be in prison
for kidnapping.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.555
I'd like to see
her committed.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.757
It's possible her
condition is treatable.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.826
And if it's not?

27:42.862 --> 27:45.428
Then the asylum
is where she'd reside.

27:45.464 --> 27:49.366
I suppose I should have
a charitable mind about it.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.269
She does have excellent
taste in men.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.173
How is miss newsome?

27:57.209 --> 28:00.711
She's a bit shaken up
by the whole ordeal.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.579
I can imagine.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.114
Should I reach out to her?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.849
I shouldn't think so.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.118
Effie's made
of stern stuff.

28:08.253 --> 28:09.653
A good night's sleep,
she'll be fine.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.125
Have you spoken
to the detective?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.594
Yes. He found harry.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.062
Oh, that's good news.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.664
So, he'll be
coming home soon?

28:20.799 --> 28:23.299
Yes. I suppose.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.841
What do you want?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.110
A moment of your time.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.978
I have nothing to say to you.
I have a lawyer coming.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.214
Oh? You may want
to hold off on that.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.084
And why's that?

28:41.153 --> 28:44.020
Because I'm about
to make you an offer

28:44.022 --> 28:45.789
You had best not refuse.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.552
Oh!

29:16.722 --> 29:19.389
[laughs]

29:31.137 --> 29:32.468
The boy can live.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.137
And the woman?

29:34.140 --> 29:36.607
Depends on what you
are prepared to offer me.

29:36.609 --> 29:39.743
If miss fulford
is granted her freedom,

29:39.745 --> 29:43.413
Then I will have no reason to
pursue any matter against you,

29:43.482 --> 29:46.350
Or any other member
of the black hand.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.085
Except mr. Falcone?

29:48.087 --> 29:49.652
Except mr. Falcone.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.955
He will be put away
for a long time.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.890
Okay.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.626
Then the woman can live.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.163
You can give me
this assurance?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.766
The matter
of anna fulford

30:02.901 --> 30:05.501
Is only of concern
to the falcone family.

30:05.538 --> 30:10.173
The rest of the organization
would rather not be involved

30:10.242 --> 30:13.510
In chasing some silly woman
who did nothing wrong.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.646
You can assure me
that his grievance

30:16.682 --> 30:19.583
Isn't shared by any other
member of the black hand?

30:19.718 --> 30:21.919
If falcone is out
of the picture,

30:21.921 --> 30:25.455
We will wash our hands
of the whole affair.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.657
You have my word.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.127
And what's that worth?

30:30.129 --> 30:31.728
As much as yours.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.439
I wish your son
a long and happy life.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.352
No sign of her, george.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.553
I imagine she's
far away from here,

30:56.688 --> 30:58.154
If she knows
what's good for her.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.623
Right. Higgins, look at this.

30:59.692 --> 31:00.757
What is it?

31:00.793 --> 31:02.025
Windsor newspaper archives.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.360
Here's a story
about a house fire;

31:03.495 --> 31:05.762
An entire family
was killed.

31:05.764 --> 31:06.964
Sounds like a shame.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.632
There were two survivors,
a couple of children

31:08.634 --> 31:10.033
That the family took in.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.568
Uh-huh.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.536
Twin girls.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.307
-And they murdered the family?
-Well, I don't know.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.641
I suppose it could've
been an accident,

31:18.677 --> 31:20.243
But it says here there
were rumblings at the time,

31:20.246 --> 31:22.245
Something funny
about the fire.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.414
Well, there's nothing
funny about a fire, george.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.116
And I speak
from experience.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.185
Ruthie almost burned our
house down a few nights ago.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.453
How?

31:30.489 --> 31:31.655
Warming milk.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.790
Good lord. Don't you have
a nanny, or some such?

31:33.926 --> 31:35.325
She quit.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.560
And you didn't
hire another?

31:36.695 --> 31:38.261
She quit, too.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.330
Ruthie can be
quite demanding.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.432
Little jordan can be
quite a handful, as well.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.134
Jordan?

31:44.136 --> 31:46.269
I don't know where you
came up with that name.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.138
Came to ruthie
in a dream.

31:50.876 --> 31:54.611
So, are you still going to
ask miss newsome to marry you?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.612
I don't know, higgins.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.281
Now hardly seems
like the right time.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.217
I think that as long
as those two are out there,

32:01.253 --> 32:04.287
There's never going
to be a right time.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.571
Enjoying your
grape juice?

32:21.607 --> 32:24.107
You know they didn't
do it, don't you?

32:24.109 --> 32:25.776
I don't care.

32:25.911 --> 32:26.843
Then let them go.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.445
No.
They're up to something.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.114
If they wanted to
kill mr. Larkin,

32:31.150 --> 32:33.182
They had ample
opportunity.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.584
And so did
the daughter.

32:34.586 --> 32:38.788
And up until recently she's
had the perfect alibi: Death.

32:38.924 --> 32:42.459
So, what does arresting
them accomplish?

32:42.594 --> 32:44.261
If she's a good person
she'll come forward.

32:44.396 --> 32:48.197
The whole of toronto considers
her parents to be murderers.

32:48.233 --> 32:50.233
Let's see if she
can live with that.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.203
And if she can?

32:53.272 --> 32:55.805
I'll let them go.
Right now I'm just fishing.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.542
You're troubled,
aren't you?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.111
You're very
perceptive.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.746
You want to talk about it?

33:02.748 --> 33:04.280
Just leave it, watts,
all right?

33:04.416 --> 33:05.816
Oh, of course.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.894
About time.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.339
Well?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.508
You aren't
going anywhere.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.511
We had a deal.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.079
Had.

33:36.214 --> 33:39.049
But I've made another
deal with the black hand,

33:39.051 --> 33:40.716
A better deal.

33:44.322 --> 33:45.789
I'll recant everything
I told you,

33:45.924 --> 33:48.858
Every bit of information
I gave you.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.660
You go ahead.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.396
I have others who will swear

33:53.399 --> 33:56.600
That you and falcone
acted alone.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.435
Acted alone
about what?

33:58.570 --> 34:01.137
You murdered an innocent woman
and put her body

34:01.206 --> 34:03.540
In a barrel of lye
and who knows how many

34:03.675 --> 34:06.042
Countless others
you did the same to?

34:07.512 --> 34:09.679
We had a deal!

34:09.815 --> 34:12.815
You were going
to kill my son.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.558
You're a dead man.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.096
We all are eventually,
mr. Rhodes.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.631
Get some sleep.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.034
I hear it's
good for you.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.534
Hello.

35:08.406 --> 35:10.607
I would like to see
my parents released.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.009
We'll decide that once we hear
what you have to say.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.415
I killed my husband,
a mr. Jack larkin.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.417
And I acted alone.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.885
Brackenreid:
You hardly did that.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.820
Your parents helped
you fake your death.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.555
That was only
to escape him.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.824
Uh, your family
did more than that.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.425
They accused him
of murder.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.860
He is a murderer.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.762
He killed
his first wife.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.730
How do you know that?

35:34.766 --> 35:37.300
He told me on more
than one occasion.

35:37.369 --> 35:38.835
Brackenreid: And you
never went to the police?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.170
He would have killed me.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.705
So I needed
to escape him.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.907
And you had escaped him

35:44.042 --> 35:46.242
And yet you
went back to kill him.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.376
Why?

35:51.183 --> 35:53.116
He beat me.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.317
Almost every day.

35:56.221 --> 35:57.654
And I let him.

35:57.789 --> 36:00.390
I thought once he was
arrested it would be over

36:00.525 --> 36:03.326
And no woman would
ever have to suffer him.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.995
But then I saw him free.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.066
And with another woman.

36:10.102 --> 36:12.536
I couldn't have that
on my conscience.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.205
You should have come
to the police.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.806
You had him.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.408
And you did nothing.

36:22.214 --> 36:24.413
Please,
let my family go.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.882
They did nothing wrong
except try and save me.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.665
Watts:
What happens now?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.768
We recommend leniency.

36:44.903 --> 36:48.371
A japanese woman kills
a well-respected white man.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.840
What sort of leniency
will be granted?

36:50.909 --> 36:53.643
Hopefully enough to
save her from the noose.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.540
I am in your debt,
georges.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.742
Ah, it was pleasure enough
to be of assistance.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.412
I've told your superior that
you are a most able officer.

37:29.547 --> 37:32.749
Thank you, but that
was hardly necessary.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.483
You are destined
for greater things.

37:34.519 --> 37:35.819
I am french, sir.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.621
The position I hold is as
far as I will ever advance.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.956
The montreal police is
not favourably inclined

37:40.993 --> 37:42.692
Toward its
french officers.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.694
Hm. Of course.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.696
I have faced something
similar in toronto.

37:46.732 --> 37:50.433
The constabulary does not
look favorably upon catholics.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.101
Hm.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.604
What would
a neptunian make of us?

37:54.673 --> 37:56.639
A neptunian?

37:56.642 --> 37:58.508
A being from
another planet.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.109
What would they think
about how we on earth

38:00.145 --> 38:01.444
Are dividing ourselves?

38:01.579 --> 38:05.048
Especially since we are,
essentially, all the same.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.850
But I wonder
what neptunians

38:07.886 --> 38:09.719
Think of venusians?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.988
Ah, not much I would think.
They are a bad bunch.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.058
Would you mind if I
accompanied you to the train?

38:15.060 --> 38:16.526
I would
appreciate that.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.260
Have you given
much thought

38:18.297 --> 38:19.863
To other species
inhabiting this earth?

38:19.998 --> 38:21.931
Like, uh, mermen?

38:22.067 --> 38:25.402
Oh. I think mole men
are far more probable.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.203
I feel that,
as well.

38:27.272 --> 38:30.740
If you are ever in toronto,
there's someone you should meet.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.677
For the journey home.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.079
[speaking french]

38:36.148 --> 38:37.480
I have converted you.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.514
We'll see.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.158
What is it?

38:48.293 --> 38:50.926
You son's in winnipeg.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.698
-We have friends there.
-Reliable friends.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.367
Is he safe?

38:57.369 --> 38:59.502
As far as we know.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.246
The rest of
your payment.

39:10.282 --> 39:11.648
We haven't brought
him back yet.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.784
I don't want you to.
His life is his own now.

39:14.820 --> 39:18.388
What he does with it,
that's up to him.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.390
I appreciate this.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.991
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

Sometimes you don't know

39:35.807 --> 39:37.407
How your day is going
to turn, do you?

39:37.542 --> 39:38.942
I didn't expect it
to come to much,

39:39.077 --> 39:41.144
But today was
a very good day.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.346
I do feel like I'm
starting to fit in

39:43.348 --> 39:45.148
With the people
I work with.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.617
Julia ogden helped me
with a case today.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.951
Perhaps I'm not
infallible,

39:49.020 --> 39:51.755
But she seems not
a bad soul at all.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.290
Maybe she just needed
a second chance.

39:54.359 --> 39:57.026
Which got me
thinking.

39:57.028 --> 40:00.129
We all need a second chance
sometimes, don't we?

40:02.333 --> 40:03.399
Would you like one?

40:18.183 --> 40:19.649
Thank you.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.250
This is our
second chance.

40:21.386 --> 40:23.920
How do you feel?

40:24.055 --> 40:26.288
Grateful.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.923
I feel grateful.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.559
Good.

Oh, george.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.427
You're all right.
You're all right.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.628
You're all right.

[distant thud]

41:07.098 --> 41:08.898
-What was that?
-What?

41:09.033 --> 41:11.634
That noise.
George, at the window.

[distant cat]

41:14.706 --> 41:15.571
Effie.

41:24.516 --> 41:25.848
There's nothing there.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.851
Are you sure?

41:27.986 --> 41:28.951
I'm sure.

<i> Yours, william.</i>

42:18.803 --> 42:21.538
If you would rather
I not send it, I won't.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.205
Of course not,
william.

42:23.275 --> 42:27.176
It's clear that
you share something.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.979
And he's your son.

42:30.015 --> 42:33.515
He should be a part
of your life.

42:34.752 --> 42:36.185
Our life.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.587
Yes. Our life.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.592
Although I'm not sure
how I'd tolerate two of you.

42:45.864 --> 42:47.797
You could.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.532
He has a keen
interest in science.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.601
Not much of a surprise.

42:52.637 --> 42:56.739
It's not something
I ever thought I would need.

42:59.544 --> 43:02.011
I've always known
that about you, william.

43:02.047 --> 43:04.614
And I'm glad
you have it.

43:07.118 --> 43:08.417
Thank you.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.954
I'm going to
get ready for bed.

43:12.023 --> 43:13.623
I'll join you.
