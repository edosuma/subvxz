00:01.377 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on Designated Survivor...</i>

00:04.255 --> 00:06.007
Capitol's been attacked. Eagle is gone.

00:06.132 --> 00:07.633
Congress, the Cabinet.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.301
Sir, you are now the President.

00:09.427 --> 00:11.595
Some bad people did something bad tonight,

00:11.721 --> 00:13.597
and it's Dad's job
to make sure we're all safe.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.516
I've been with Secretary Kirkman's staff
for three years.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.852
It's President Kirkman,
and you're not authorized.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.228
Do we know who's responsible for this?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.521
Still too early to determine.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.523
We gotta give 'em something,
the whole world is watching.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.943
We have a Housing and Urban Development
Secretary running the free world.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.362
You're talking
about removing a sitting president.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.613
Got something over here!

00:29.739 --> 00:30.656
Easy.

00:30.781 --> 00:31.615
What do you see?

00:32.616 --> 00:34.285
It's clear. Bomb's a dud.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.163
You don't take credit for something
until you're done, right?

00:38.039 --> 00:39.999
So, what if they're just getting started?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.341
- There was no chatter.
- I understand there was no chatter

00:49.467 --> 00:51.927
but we still need to check
all of the usual suspects:

00:52.053 --> 00:54.305
Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Al-Sakar.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.307
Where are we with local law enforcement?

00:56.432 --> 00:59.560
I've coordinated with D.C. police,
Secret Service, Metro, and Capitol.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.812
All right, that's good. Now, remember,
the high-value target list

01:01.937 --> 01:03.397
only starts with the White House.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.608
We need to heighten security
at every location.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.651
Already taken care of.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.164
- You taking that bomb to Andrews?
- Yeah.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.374
Top brass wants everything
cataloged under one roof.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.376
Deputy Director!
We need you over here!

01:24.502 --> 01:25.377
All right.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.234
<i>My fellow Americans.</i>

01:49.110 --> 01:51.403
<i>Tonight, our way of life
came under attack.</i>

01:51.946 --> 01:54.240
<i>This act of cowardice
was meant to cripple our nation.</i>

01:55.116 --> 01:57.034
<i>But as before,
America will show the world</i>

01:57.159 --> 01:59.453
<i>that we will not bow down to fear,</i>

01:59.578 --> 02:02.748
<i>that we</i> will <i>fight back,
that we will persevere.</i>

02:02.873 --> 02:04.583
<i>This was
President Tom Kirkman's</i>

02:04.708 --> 02:05.918
<i>first address to the nation.</i>

02:06.043 --> 02:09.045
<i>It came just two hours
after he was unceremoniously</i>

02:09.170 --> 02:10.714
<i>sworn in as our new president.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:15.010
<i>Unfortunately, last night's speech
did little to calm the frayed nerves--</i>

02:15.136 --> 02:15.970
<i>Words aside,</i>

02:16.095 --> 02:18.848
<i>Kirkman is an unelected,
untested HUD secretary</i>

02:18.973 --> 02:20.975
<i>at a time when the world
is looking for leadership.</i>

02:21.100 --> 02:23.727
<i>...remains of the Capitol,
searching for both survivors</i>

02:23.853 --> 02:25.187
<i>and answers to the questions</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:26.564
<i>all Americans are asking:</i>

02:26.689 --> 02:30.025
<i>how did this happen
and will life ever be the sa--</i>

03:01.265 --> 03:02.892
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Good morning.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.060
West Wing, right or left?

03:05.186 --> 03:06.770
This way, to the right, sir.

03:06.896 --> 03:07.813
Thank you very much.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.648
Phoenix on the move.

03:15.988 --> 03:19.158
My wife didn't want me to come in today.
She's afraid the White House is next.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.370
I was supposed to go last night,

03:23.495 --> 03:24.914
but I couldn't get a sitter.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.374
What are we gonna do?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.463
Melissa's dead, everyone's dead.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.340
Mr. President.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.383
- Aaron.
- Good morning.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.344
We have a briefing
waiting for you in the Oval, sir.

03:38.469 --> 03:39.220
Good.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.262
Mr. President.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.096
Wyatt, right?

03:41.222 --> 03:42.306
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.766
Sir, I just have to warn you.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.144
This might be a bit more hectic
than you're used to.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.647
I understand. I think we'll be fine.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.607
We've increased security
to our oil and gas pipelines,

03:51.732 --> 03:53.859
power grids, refineries,
chemical storage tanks.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.611
Mass transit is still on lock down,

03:55.736 --> 03:58.239
planes and trains.
Immigration remains frozen.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.741
Sir, you have to authorize
we close the banks immediately.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.535
No, we can't do that. We cannot keep
the American people from their money.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.664
48 hours without Bank of America
is better than a 48-month depression.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.625
If everyone withdraws their money
at the same time, the banks will collapse.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.627
- Where are we at with the bombing?
- Deputy Director Atwood

04:11.752 --> 04:13.504
will be briefing us soon.
We're looking at groups

04:13.629 --> 04:15.965
with the skills and resources
to do something like this.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.050
Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda, North Korea, RGB.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.010
Well, what's this
about violence in Michigan?

04:20.135 --> 04:22.096
We're getting reports
of flare-ups in Dearborn.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.014
Police targeting
the local Muslim community.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.600
Yeah, but what I want to know is
how did the terrorists bring explosives

04:26.725 --> 04:28.560
into the Capitol building
in the first place.

04:28.686 --> 04:31.397
We're working on that. In the meantime,
we have to go after everyone we suspect.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.942
We go after them, after their families,
any way we can.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.902
I'm sorry, are you talking
about enhanced interrogation?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.821
They destroyed our Capitol.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.198
I'm saying we do whatever we have to do.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.787
Can I just get a moment?!

04:46.912 --> 04:49.290
Everybody, why don't we just focus
on one thing at a time?

04:51.709 --> 04:53.127
Please, excuse me.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.149
Please, can you just give me a moment?

06:09.995 --> 06:12.164
Tom... I'm sorry.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.040
Mr. President.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.000
I just needed to find
somewhere quiet.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.002
Yeah, admittedly,
it got a little loud in there.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.087
Loud?

06:18.212 --> 06:20.130
A Caps game is loud, Aaron.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.091
Back there in the Oval Office,
that was chaos.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.135
We need order, a system,
or this is never gonna work.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.763
We need to get this government
up and running.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.099
We need a cabinet, and fast.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.101
That's a good idea, sir,
but first order of business

06:32.226 --> 06:33.894
is going to be naming your Chief of Staff.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.562
Seriously? You're making a play right now?

06:35.687 --> 06:36.480
Enough!

06:37.231 --> 06:39.274
I'm not ready to make that decision.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.778
What I <i>need</i> is both of you to step up
and help me put together a cabinet.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.488
Tell me you can do that.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.490
- Of course.
- Yes, Mr. President.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.616
Good.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.286
For now, we're gonna close the banks.
ATMs and credit will still be available.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.247
I want you to monitor
the situation in Michigan

06:53.372 --> 06:56.417
and I want you to keep me up to speed
on the investigation into the bombing.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.253
The American people want to know
who did this, and so do I.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.212
Sir.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.881
Also...

07:04.716 --> 07:07.845
Later today, I want to see
the Capitol Building or what's left of it.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.638
Are you sure
that's a... good idea--

07:09.763 --> 07:12.307
No, no, no.
That's exactly what you need, sir.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.267
A do-over.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.311
Last night's speech
didn't exactly put minds at ease.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.439
But you, sir, at the site,

07:18.564 --> 07:19.481
now that sends a message.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.483
- It shows--
- Respect, Aaron.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.694
It shows respect.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.113
It's not a photo-op.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.199
- Whatever you say, sir.
- Good.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.661
Let's get back to work.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.060
Sir. Hold it right there.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.104
Morning, what's going on?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.523
- What's in the backpack?
- What?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.317
Your backpack, what's in it?

08:03.442 --> 08:06.195
Uh, my stuff for, uh, work.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.696
- Papers and stuff.
- Where do you work?

08:08.363 --> 08:09.490
I work at the White House.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.325
Really? The White House?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.535
Yeah, you know,
where the President sleeps.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.661
You being a wise ass?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.206
I'd like to know why you stopped me.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.500
Why don't you tell us where you live
and show us some ID first?

08:21.543 --> 08:22.628
I live right there.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.421
It's cold and it's cramped,

08:24.546 --> 08:27.341
but I can walk to my gym,
so I got that going for me.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.722
Seth Wright.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.517
That your real name?

08:36.642 --> 08:38.268
According to my mother.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.062
Keith.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.898
This looks good.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.525
Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Wright.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.526
Thank you.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.321
Yeah, stay safe.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.870
Look, I got to go.

08:56.995 --> 08:57.955
Tell Mom I love her.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.583
Okay, cabinet members.
What about Blanchard?

09:01.708 --> 09:02.501
For State?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.044
He's qualified,
three years as deputy.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.130
He also has two secret Facebook accounts
and an affinity for the coeds

09:07.256 --> 09:09.716
who look after his kids.
I'm thinking Garfield's our guy.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.134
No, think again.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.303
He's made more than
a few enemies on the Hill.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.848
Emily, I hate to break it to you,
but there is no Hill anymore.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.437
Oh, my God.
There's no Hill anymore.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.356
Something happened in Michigan.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.316
What?

09:29.319 --> 09:30.779
- Mr. President.
- You don't need to get up

09:30.904 --> 09:33.282
every time I walk into a room.
I'm not the Queen.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.784
No, sir. Virtually no resemblance.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.868
I'm sorry to interrupt.

09:36.994 --> 09:40.163
- I... I actually came in to apologize.
- Apologize?

09:40.289 --> 09:43.083
Last night,
you wrote me a home-run of a speech.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.835
This morning, it seems like the press

09:44.960 --> 09:46.962
wished anybody else delivered it but me.

09:48.797 --> 09:49.590
Mr. President.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.050
Maybe the country's just not ready, yet...

09:53.093 --> 09:55.470
to come together behind anyone...

09:55.596 --> 09:57.097
even with the best speech in the world.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.640
Maybe.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.933
Mr. President.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.268
There's something you need to see.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.896
<i>Police imposing a curfew
on predominantly Muslim neighborhoods</i>

10:05.022 --> 10:08.525
<i>and ordering residents
to obey it or face arrest.</i>

10:08.650 --> 10:11.653
<i>These are citizens who have not been
charged with any crimes,</i>

10:11.778 --> 10:12.529
<i>who are simply targeted</i>

10:12.654 --> 10:14.656
<i>because of their religious beliefs.</i>

10:15.449 --> 10:19.202
<i>The American Civil Liberties Union
denounced the actions by Dearborn police</i>

10:19.328 --> 10:22.080
<i>- as a violation...</i>
- Mr. President, we're ready.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.500
<i>...basic civil rights. But in the wake
of the attack on the Capitol,</i>

10:25.626 --> 10:28.295
<i>some are saying
this is just the type of policing</i>

10:28.420 --> 10:29.796
<i>this country needs.</i>

10:32.174 --> 10:33.467
- Governor...?
- Royce.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.927
Governor Royce, how are you?

10:36.553 --> 10:37.512
About as expected.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.556
There's a lot to manage here,
as you can imagine.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.434
I know, and I want to help.
I've seen reports

10:42.559 --> 10:45.062
that police in Dearborn are rounding up
members of the Muslim community.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.773
- Yes, I'm aware.
<i>- Well, like I said,</i>

10:47.898 --> 10:49.483
we'd like to help you stop the police.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.027
Why would I stop the police?
They're acting on my orders.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.945
- Your orders?
<i>- That's correct.</i>

10:54.071 --> 10:55.322
<i>I don't know if you know this,</i>

10:55.447 --> 10:57.532
<i>but I have the largest Muslim population
in the country, here.</i>

10:57.658 --> 10:59.076
That doesn't mean
they're doing anything wrong

10:59.201 --> 11:00.494
<i>or that they've been radicalized.</i>

11:00.619 --> 11:02.996
No, but I'm willing to bet
they know someone who is.

11:04.081 --> 11:07.209
Governor, you can't target an innocent
population because you're scared.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.753
- You have a responsibility--
<i>- To all my citizens.</i>

11:09.878 --> 11:13.006
And my first and only priority
is to make sure they're safe,

11:13.131 --> 11:16.385
something that Washington -
if there even is such a place anymore -

11:16.510 --> 11:18.637
<i>has proven incapable of doing.</i>

11:18.762 --> 11:19.971
Governor, the federal government--

11:20.097 --> 11:22.224
<i>Was effectively snuffed out last night.</i>

11:22.349 --> 11:25.686
There is no Congress,
there is no Supreme Court.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.689
When it comes to the people of Michigan,
I am the highest authority,

11:28.814 --> 11:30.482
and you have none over me.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.068
With all due respect, sir,
I am the President.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.571
Not mine.
So you'll have to excuse me, Mr. Kirkman.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.949
While you're busy learning
how to become President,

11:39.074 --> 11:41.451
I've got 10 million citizens to protect.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.329
Governor?

11:45.997 --> 11:47.624
Governor Royce?
Hello?

12:05.475 --> 12:06.977
Sir, you should know
that messages of support

12:07.102 --> 12:09.438
continue to pour in from heads of state
around the world.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.815
We should go over which calls
you want to return personally.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.401
I would think all of them.
How many calls are we talking about?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.486
About 175, sir.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.029
Maybe we should prioritize.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.156
Mr. President.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.451
I want you to know I don't care
what the so-called pundits are saying.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.578
I was very moved by your words last night.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.329
Well, thank you.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.956
Excuse me, but who are you?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.584
Mr. President, this is congresswoman
Kimble Hookstraten.

12:31.209 --> 12:31.918
Congresswoman.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.464
Yes, I was last night's
other designated survivor.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.175
Other designated...

12:39.760 --> 12:41.303
Excuse us, please.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.554
Thank you, sir.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.266
There are <i>two</i> designated survivors?

12:46.391 --> 12:47.601
Yeah, the Republicans chose someone

12:47.726 --> 12:49.811
to sit out of the State of the Union
as well.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.062
So they'd be represented.

12:51.188 --> 12:51.980
Smart.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.065
Hey, what do you know about Hookstraten?

12:54.191 --> 12:56.359
You were on Senator Carlyle's staff
when they were both

12:56.485 --> 12:58.111
- on Ways and Means, weren't you?
- Stalker.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.155
- Come on.
- She's smart.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.492
Very smart. Third-generation D.C.
blue blood, nine years, Republican whip,

13:03.617 --> 13:05.285
knows every detail
about every player in town.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.454
So you're saying she's a lot more
experienced than the President?

13:09.831 --> 13:12.042
Come on.
Let's go get Governor Royce on the phone.

13:14.669 --> 13:18.882
435 representatives, 100 senators,
and 9 justices.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.802
- And now it's just down to the two of us.
- I know.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.179
You don't know
whether to feel... ashamed

13:24.304 --> 13:25.806
or grateful to be alive.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.433
- Apologetic.
- Sir?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.977
To the American people
for being stuck with me as their leader.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.103
I mean, let's face it,

13:32.229 --> 13:33.480
the pundits might be right.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.148
Mr. President...

13:36.024 --> 13:37.984
Do you know what I did this morning, sir?

13:38.109 --> 13:40.862
I cried and then I prayed.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.116
Do you know when the last time
I did those two things together was?

13:45.242 --> 13:46.535
9/11?

13:47.953 --> 13:50.539
Nobody thought we could get through it
back then, but we did.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.834
And nobody thinks
we can get through it now, but we will.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.127
This is <i>your</i> house now.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.088
So make it your own.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.174
Whatever you need, just ask.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.468
Republican, Democrat, Independent...

14:04.052 --> 14:05.846
It doesn't matter anymore.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.764
We're all Americans today.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.810
Thank you, Congresswoman.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.479
Kimble, please.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.897
Okay.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.734
Kimble, later this afternoon,

14:19.860 --> 14:22.863
I'm going to the Capitol site
to thank the first responders.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.824
I think it'd be a nice show of unity
if we do that together.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.284
What do you say?

14:27.409 --> 14:28.994
I'd be honored, sir.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.537
Thank you, Mr. President.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.872
Thank you.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.664
Ronnie, is that the unexploded munition?

15:14.789 --> 15:15.874
Yep.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.626
What's it telling us?

15:18.043 --> 15:20.003
Russian anti-tank mine,

15:20.128 --> 15:22.172
likely pulled from the ground
in Afghanistan.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.256
But look here.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.675
The guts are cannibalized.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.638
Cyrillic on the outside,
but the lock ring is Pakistani.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.723
And the firing pin is newer,

15:31.848 --> 15:33.600
probably Iranian.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.520
That is consistent with what we've seen
from some Jihadist terror groups.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.189
We should be able
to point the finger directly

15:39.314 --> 15:41.232
when we get the lab results
from the other bombs.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.568
Right, but this one,
why didn't this one go off?

15:44.152 --> 15:45.570
Any number of reasons.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.156
Russian red wire
to Iranian green doesn't work,

15:48.281 --> 15:49.658
the main charge degraded.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.202
But I wouldn't rule out
good old-fashioned human error.

15:52.327 --> 15:56.790
You're telling me that the people
who blew up our U.S. Capitol in one shot,

15:56.915 --> 15:58.959
didn't test the triggers, the wiring?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.211
Then what are you suggesting?

16:03.838 --> 16:04.881
Hannah?

16:05.799 --> 16:08.343
What if this bomb wasn't meant to explode?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.095
What if it was meant to be found?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.185
Look, I don't care
what the Governor's doing.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.271
The President of the United Sates
needs to talk to him.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.816
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.275
I'm not gonna hold!

16:25.193 --> 16:26.152
Damn it!

16:26.820 --> 16:29.447
You'd think there would be more people
qualified for Attorney General.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.282
What the hell am I supposed to say?

16:31.783 --> 16:32.993
Is this a writer thing?

16:33.118 --> 16:36.037
I'm trying to find a way to unite us
at Kirkman's remarks at the rubble,

16:36.162 --> 16:38.081
but Michigan is probably
just the beginning.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.874
The world is falling apart.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.085
Probably don't wanna put that
in the speech.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.169
Yes, I'm still here.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.338
God, it's unbelievable.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.548
I like Wynbrandt.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.802
He went to city college at night,
law school, good family man.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.429
Massey's our guy.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.723
He clerked for Thomas, he went to Yale.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.725
Editor of the Law Journal.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.102
It's all about what's on paper for you.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.353
I heard Wynbrandt speak.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.272
The man has good values.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.857
Emily, the Governor of Michigan

17:03.982 --> 17:06.651
is basically declaring his state
a sovereign nation,

17:06.776 --> 17:08.694
so we don't have time for values.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.031
I probably shouldn't put that
in the speech either, right?

17:12.156 --> 17:15.326
Governor Royce said that?
That he's the highest authority?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.163
That's what he said,
and in no uncertain terms.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.623
Then he hung the phone up on me.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.292
Well, he doesn't get to do that.
He has a constitutional obligation--

17:23.417 --> 17:24.544
Don't you get it, Alex?

17:24.669 --> 17:28.381
Royce wants to tear up the Constitution,
and he's not the only one.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.759
- You can't let him.
- Trust me, I'm not going to.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.012
We've got some lawyers coming over
from the Attorney General's office.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.806
We'll figure out what our legal options
are, and we'll handle it.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.603
How you holding up?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.397
I spoke to Duncan. The courts are closed.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.942
Markets, banks, schools, airports...

17:48.068 --> 17:50.820
- Everything.
- Half the junior associates in the firm,

17:50.945 --> 17:53.281
they're thinking of leaving Washington.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.867
How's Penny?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.579
You think she even understands
what's happening?

17:59.704 --> 18:00.747
Besides the fact

18:00.872 --> 18:03.541
that we now live in the White House,
her father is the President,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.127
and she's sleeping in a very big bed...

18:06.920 --> 18:07.670
No, not really.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.839
I've been trying to keep her away
from the TV.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.466
And Leo?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.843
He's been in his room all day,
with the door shut.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.720
So, basically being Leo.

18:16.554 --> 18:17.806
Basically.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.225
Do you think we could,

18:20.350 --> 18:22.393
for five minutes,

18:22.519 --> 18:24.521
just pretend
that this isn't really happening?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.027
Kind of hard to do in the Oval Office.

18:39.994 --> 18:40.787
I'm sorry, sir.

18:40.912 --> 18:41.996
I told him you were busy.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.915
It's all right.
How can I help you, General?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.416
I'm afraid that's something

18:45.542 --> 18:47.627
we have to discuss in private,
Mr. President.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.046
Oh. This is my wife.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.466
Your wife does not have
code-word clearance, sir.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.343
Of course.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.970
I'll go.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.054
Ma'am.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.393
What is it?

19:03.518 --> 19:06.646
I just spoke
to FBI Deputy Director Atwood.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.273
The lab results came in.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.359
They've made a positive ID
on the explosives.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.528
We know who blew up the Capitol.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.032
Al-Sakar likes mass-casuality attacks.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.826
A chlorine storage tank in Manila,

19:19.951 --> 19:22.871
sarin gas canisters lobbed
onto our military base in Nairobi.

19:22.996 --> 19:26.374
Preliminary analysis from the FBI's
Explosive Device Center tells us

19:26.499 --> 19:28.585
that residue found on the Capitol debris

19:28.710 --> 19:32.422
is consistent with bombs
used by Al-Sakar in the past.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.341
Mr. President,
it's time to publicly name

19:35.466 --> 19:37.510
Al-Sakar as the perpetrator of this crime

19:37.635 --> 19:39.429
- and take appropriate action.
- Okay.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.513
Before we do anything,

19:40.638 --> 19:44.601
the FBI is absolutely certain
that Al-Sakar was behind the attack?

19:45.185 --> 19:46.603
75%, sir.

19:47.061 --> 19:47.979
75%?

19:48.104 --> 19:50.356
That's as high as it gets
when it comes to a call like this.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.027
75 is still a "C" on a test, General.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.904
This is not a test. This is war.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.448
All the more reason to get it right,
don't you think?

19:58.573 --> 20:00.950
Sir, I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.078
You did a fine job staving off
the Iranians last night.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.623
But I am advising you
that the country is on the brink,

20:06.748 --> 20:07.832
and talk will not work here.

20:07.957 --> 20:12.086
America is demanding action
and I am giving you an enemy we can kill.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.757
You think I don't want to strike back
against the people who did this?

20:15.882 --> 20:18.509
I lost colleagues, friends, people I love.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.929
I want to find every single person
involved in this attack

20:21.054 --> 20:23.806
from planning to execution
and rip them limb from limb,

20:23.932 --> 20:26.976
which is why I need to know
<i>exactly</i> who did this.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.521
Come back to me with more than 75%,

20:30.647 --> 20:32.690
and I'll launch the damn missiles myself.

20:32.815 --> 20:33.858
How much more.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.402
25, damn it!

20:39.656 --> 20:42.075
<i>The death toll
as of 30 minutes ago...</i>

20:42.825 --> 20:44.285
is 900 plus.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.872
That includes the President,
Vice President, Cabinet...

20:48.373 --> 20:51.876
those we've been able to ID
from Congress and the Supreme Court...

20:52.669 --> 20:56.214
And FBI Director Jacobs
is also confirmed dead.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.426
The working theory is
this is the work of Al-Sakar.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.346
So as we know,
this is the latest offshoot of Al-Qaeda.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.556
They are dispersed
throughout North Africa,

21:05.682 --> 21:07.767
which makes them very, very hard to track.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.310
So we need to be crafty.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.855
We need to reach out to your sources,
spread some cash around,

21:12.981 --> 21:16.150
do whatever you have to do
to firm up that link.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.735
What about credit?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.028
What about it?

21:19.153 --> 21:20.655
Is Al-Sakar taking credit?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.282
No, they haven't.

21:22.407 --> 21:26.703
But it was months before Bin Laden
took responsibility for the Towers, so...

21:27.870 --> 21:28.621
That's all for now.

21:29.122 --> 21:29.872
Agent Wells.

21:36.713 --> 21:37.672
How are you doing?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.174
Same as everyone else, I guess.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.345
I just came from Andrews.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.514
The bomb we just found, the UXO...

21:47.557 --> 21:49.600
it may not be telling you
what you think it is.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.935
Okay, I'll bite.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.438
All right, well,
what if they wanted us to find it

21:53.563 --> 21:56.441
so that we would look at Al-Sakar
and not consider any other options?

21:56.566 --> 21:58.443
Can you back up your theory?

21:58.568 --> 22:01.237
Well, my theories were good enough for you
in '09 in Iraq.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.239
This is different, Hannah,
and you know it.

22:03.364 --> 22:06.492
Besides, I've already talked
to General Cochrane and the Joint Chiefs.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.828
You're still gonna brief
the President later, right?

22:08.953 --> 22:09.746
Mm-hmm.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.706
Best to give them all the theories,
don't you think?

22:13.416 --> 22:16.586
So if it wasn't Al-Sakar,
who blew up the Capitol Building?

22:17.545 --> 22:20.089
I don't know, yet,
and that's what scares me.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.178
Thanks, Mike.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.889
Okay, what do I do?
Am I supposed to smile?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.223
Because I'll probably feel like crying.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.225
- Just be yourself.
- I know, I just...

22:31.351 --> 22:34.395
I don't want to let you down,
I don't want to let the country down,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.898
and I hate this
that they picked it out for me.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.692
Look, I look like the White House sofa.

22:39.817 --> 22:40.943
It's to fit over this, ma'am.

22:41.069 --> 22:42.820
Mike, is this all really necessary?

22:42.945 --> 22:45.239
Two ways the President and his family
can leave the White House.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.743
Out the front door in Kevlar vests
and a 13-car armored motorcade

22:48.868 --> 22:52.163
or out the back in a Chevy
and a ball cap.

22:52.789 --> 22:53.831
Give me the coat.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.249
Daddy!

22:55.375 --> 22:57.168
Hey, little pea, how are you?

22:59.754 --> 23:00.963
What are you wearing?

23:01.089 --> 23:03.883
Oh, this? This is just to protect me
in case I fall down.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.177
Cool thing is you can punch it,
I won't feel a thing.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.804
Go on, try.

23:10.681 --> 23:11.599
Come here.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.185
I love you so much.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.273
- It's time, sir.
- Okay.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.983
Hold on. Where's Leo?

23:21.109 --> 23:22.944
Relax, Mom, I'm here.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.196
Okay, you need to watch your sister.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.574
And keep her away from the TV, okay?
Any of the news,

23:28.699 --> 23:30.660
it's too real. She doesn't need to see it.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.203
Have you got that?

23:33.246 --> 23:34.330
Yeah, I understand.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.709
Sir, you won't be wearing a tie.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.420
It's not a formal occasion, Aaron.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.505
Okay. Let's go.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.133
Phoenix is ready and on the move.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.220
Mike, just out of curiosity,
what was it before?

23:49.345 --> 23:50.721
Sir?

23:50.847 --> 23:54.267
My code name when I was Secretary of HUD,
what was it?

23:55.017 --> 23:57.645
Glasses, sir.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.073
We left word for the Governor
three hours ago.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.367
Yeah, please tell him, again.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.704
Forget politics, it's just plain rude.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.330
What the hell's wrong with people anyway?

24:17.039 --> 24:17.999
People are scared, Aaron.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.501
The Capitol used to be
a symbol of strength,

24:20.626 --> 24:22.253
and now it's a pile of ashes.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.172
And everyone we know is gone.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.716
You would think today, of all days,

24:26.841 --> 24:29.135
people could at least pretend
to be decent human beings.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.887
Why are you so surprised?

24:31.888 --> 24:35.141
Tragedy either makes people appreciate
their fellow men, or fear them.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.769
The Governor's no different.
He's just elected.

24:50.281 --> 24:52.575
Thanks for coming with me.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.035
Of course.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.330
What?

24:58.706 --> 25:00.124
Yesterday, I was asked to resign,

25:00.249 --> 25:02.293
and we were talking
about moving to Montreal.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.924
Now I'm trying to put the entire
U.S. government back together,

25:08.925 --> 25:11.677
and stop the country
from tearing itself apart.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.888
Hell of a day.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.225
Yeah.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.894
That's the President's motorcade
coming in.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.354
Look out.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.576
Are you ready for this?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.705
How can anybody be ready for this?

25:43.834 --> 25:45.378
Hold the work, hold the work!

26:11.904 --> 26:13.155
My God.

26:21.163 --> 26:21.998
Sir.

26:23.749 --> 26:24.667
Mr. President.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.378
Tom.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.634
Mr. President.
Jason Atwood, Deputy Director.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.511
We got a briefing ready
for you inside, sir.

26:35.636 --> 26:36.637
Okay.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.975
Prelim analysis from TEDAC

26:41.100 --> 26:44.437
indicates that the explosive residue
found on the debris

26:44.562 --> 26:47.440
is called cyclonite, also known as RDX.

26:47.565 --> 26:50.026
We believe it was mixed
with a plasticizer.

26:50.151 --> 26:52.153
And that's what maximizes the destruction,

26:52.278 --> 26:54.238
allowed the chamber
to come down on itself?

26:55.031 --> 26:55.906
Exactly.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.700
And Al-Sakar has access to RDX?

26:57.825 --> 26:59.243
Yes, sir. It's their signature.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.871
What about the device you found, the bomb?

27:01.996 --> 27:04.415
- Why didn't it go off?
- We believe it was human error.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.250
We're still running some tests.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.752
Okay.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.086
Thank you, Deputy Director.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.839
Thank you, Mr. President.
We'll keep you updated.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.432
Mike, take my coat.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.520
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to keep that vest on.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.565
Mike, we're here to project confidence.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.692
Does this vest project confidence to you?

27:36.447 --> 27:37.657
Thank you.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.078
- I win.
- You cheated.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.829
- I know your game, little girl.
- Did not!

27:45.247 --> 27:46.582
Oh, I got to take this.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.292
You're supposed to watch me.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.544
It's the White House, Penny.
I'm sure you're safe.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.390
<i>A truly somber moment</i>

28:02.515 --> 28:04.892
<i>for newly sworn-in President Kirkman</i>

28:05.017 --> 28:08.562
<i>as he makes his first visit
to the site of the terrorist attack.</i>

28:08.688 --> 28:09.814
<i>We'll stand by here for his--</i>

28:13.150 --> 28:14.151
A lot of cameras, Aaron.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.362
- You are the President, sir.
- Excuse me.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.697
Could I borrow that?

28:19.657 --> 28:21.951
Thank you. Just press here?

28:30.126 --> 28:32.169
Hello, my name is Tom Kirkman.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.256
Last night at approximately 10:30 p.m...

28:36.048 --> 28:38.551
I was sworn in
as President of the United States.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.138
I've come down here because I wanted
to thank each and every one of you...

28:42.805 --> 28:46.892
for the work that you're doing here
and let you know that America mourns.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.520
This...

28:51.439 --> 28:52.940
This was an act of madness.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.068
This was an act of terror.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.197
Yesterday, we saw the worst in humanity.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.034
Today, I see its best.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.870
I know you're all tired.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.038
Scared.

29:08.164 --> 29:11.333
I know you want answers, someone to blame,
someone to fight against.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.377
I need you to know that I want that, too.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.463
- What?
- And even, though, today...

29:15.588 --> 29:16.547
It's Michigan.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.508
...I promise you we will rise again

29:19.633 --> 29:20.843
better and stronger.

29:20.968 --> 29:21.927
<i>Get down!</i>

29:22.803 --> 29:24.513
Those who we've lost...

29:25.514 --> 29:26.515
are leaders...

29:27.683 --> 29:28.976
family members...

29:29.101 --> 29:30.728
and loved ones.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.814
I swear to you,
they will not have died in vain.

29:34.774 --> 29:35.858
See what's going on in Michigan?

29:35.983 --> 29:38.986
This place where we stand
right here, right now...

29:39.653 --> 29:42.198
...will forever be hallowed ground,

29:42.615 --> 29:43.407
and we must always...

29:45.409 --> 29:47.953
respect the incredible sacrifice...

29:48.788 --> 29:50.664
- that was made here.
- Mr. President, anything to say

29:50.790 --> 29:53.459
about the Muslim teenager in Dearborn
who was beaten by police?

29:53.584 --> 29:55.586
The President's not answering
any questions right now.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.296
- Thank you.
- You have no response, President Kirkman?

29:57.421 --> 29:58.881
I didn't hear the question.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.883
The Muslim teenager
who was beaten by police, Mr. President.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.051
- Do you have a comment?
- What?

30:02.176 --> 30:03.803
Are you concerned
their civil rights are violated?

30:03.928 --> 30:06.347
Is the White House concerned
about escalating violence against Muslims?

30:06.472 --> 30:09.225
Are you gonna let Americans get beaten,
Mr. Kirkman?

30:09.350 --> 30:10.351
Show me your hands!

30:10.476 --> 30:12.144
- Show me your hands!
- I didn't do anything wrong.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.021
Gun! Gun! Gun!

30:17.942 --> 30:19.276
Cover and evacuate to the car.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.321
Get your hands off him.
He's not doing anything.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.198
It's a phone. It's a phone!

30:24.323 --> 30:26.242
I have Phoenix! I repeat, I have Phoenix!

30:26.367 --> 30:29.328
Back up! Back up!
I said back up!

30:35.000 --> 30:36.043
Go, go, go!

30:47.471 --> 30:49.139
Get me Governor Royce on the phone now.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.433
- We're trying. He won't take the call.
- What do you mean?

30:51.559 --> 30:54.270
Do we know anything about the condition
of the boy, the one in Michigan?

30:54.395 --> 30:57.231
- He's in surgery with internal bleeding.
- He knows we're calling. He doesn't care.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.900
I want to talk to a couple lawyers
from the Attorney General's Office.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.485
- What's his name?
- Danny Fayad, ma'am.

31:01.610 --> 31:02.319
How old is he?

31:02.444 --> 31:03.863
We have a couple AG candidates

31:03.988 --> 31:05.239
- who could be helpful.
- Bring them in.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.448
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

31:06.574 --> 31:07.908
- Your daughter needs you upstairs.
- Okay.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.410
Tom, the boy...

31:10.286 --> 31:11.495
He's 17.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.372
The same age as Leo.

31:14.707 --> 31:15.457
Penny needs me.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.667
I gotta go.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.630
I don't have
to explain myself to you, Hannah.

31:21.755 --> 31:25.426
I gave the President what I determined
was the most relevant intel.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.220
Or you gave him what the group
who did this wanted you to.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.389
How can he lead if he doesn't have
all the facts?

31:30.514 --> 31:31.724
You should've given them to me.

31:32.892 --> 31:33.893
Look, it's not...

31:35.019 --> 31:37.229
that I don't believe you,
or that I don't want to.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.648
Someone blew up the Capitol.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.984
Who knows what's possible anymore.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.279
On top of that, we've got a guy in office

31:45.404 --> 31:47.156
who's number 11 in the line of succession.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.074
I can't go to him with speculation
right now.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.576
So...

31:50.701 --> 31:53.996
if you want me to go back to him
with your theory, please...

31:54.121 --> 31:55.247
prove it.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.628
The situation in Michigan
is out of control.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.504
Now we've got a teenager
in critical condition.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.715
I need to know
what my legal options are right now.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.592
Well, uh, Mr. President,

32:06.717 --> 32:10.179
you can invoke the Supremacy Clause,
issue an executive order

32:10.304 --> 32:13.474
saying Governor Royce
must force his police to stand down.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.475
That's a bad call.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.644
EOs can be perceived as very hostile.

32:16.769 --> 32:17.895
Then what would you suggest?

32:18.020 --> 32:18.979
A presidential proclamation.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.608
Which is nothing more
than a symbolic empty gesture.

32:22.733 --> 32:23.567
It looks weak, sir.

32:23.692 --> 32:27.029
Bush used a proclamation
to secure disaster areas after Katrina.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.198
That hardly seems like
an empty gesture to me.

32:29.323 --> 32:31.659
I wouldn't take declaring Martial Law
off the table either, sir.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.203
If you want this to be
the shortest presidency in history.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.122
Let me get this straight.

32:37.247 --> 32:40.918
An executive order
will be perceived as too hostile.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.087
A presidential proclamation, too weak.

32:43.212 --> 32:47.758
Martial Law, either very, very smart...
or incredibly self-destructive.

32:48.509 --> 32:49.969
Guys, let me ask you a question.

32:50.636 --> 32:51.720
Can you agree on anything?

32:51.845 --> 32:53.722
- Yes.
- Not really.

32:54.348 --> 32:55.391
Great.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.479
How is she?

33:00.604 --> 33:02.231
Well, how do you think she is?

33:02.356 --> 33:05.025
She just watched her father
almost get trampled.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.694
You had one job,

33:06.819 --> 33:08.153
to keep her away from the TV!

33:08.278 --> 33:09.530
- I did.
- Until you didn't!

33:09.655 --> 33:11.115
You... you left her alone.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.616
I got a phone call!

33:13.659 --> 33:15.160
It's not my job to be her parent.

33:17.079 --> 33:20.499
Well, guess what, we're all doing jobs
that we weren't doing yesterday.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.337
Leo, nothing's the same anymore.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.342
Look, I know it's asking a lot.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.846
But you're just gonna have
to grow up faster.

33:34.388 --> 33:37.808
I'm gonna need to count on you
in more ways than ever.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.643
Can I do that?

33:41.020 --> 33:42.438
Can I do that?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.606
Guess we'll find out.

33:48.861 --> 33:49.903
Take these to Treasury.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.905
Tell them Social Security checks
will keep going out,

33:52.031 --> 33:53.490
if I have to sign them myself.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.578
Aaron, I thought we were in agreement.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.871
Really, General?

33:59.705 --> 34:00.998
About what?

34:01.123 --> 34:03.250
He's in over his head, out of his depth.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.670
You need to convince your new boss
that Al-Sakar is behind the bombing.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.422
I think he was pretty clear in there.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.132
Until he's certain,
he will not name anyone.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.594
And as I recall,
it's your job to convince him.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.388
- Aaron, you're Chief of Staff.
- Actually, I'm not.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.725
- So, who is?
- He hasn't named one yet.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.893
And yet another trigger he won't pull.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.110
Hi.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.239
Mm. Light reading?

34:34.364 --> 34:36.158
Well, sadly, it seems that Wikipedia

34:36.283 --> 34:40.621
is a little thin
on constitutional-law theory.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.290
Well, did the lawyers
not give you any answers about Michigan?

34:43.415 --> 34:46.502
They gave me plenty of answers.
They just weren't the right ones.

34:46.627 --> 34:47.920
It doesn't even matter, yet.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.880
I can't get Governor Royce
back on the phone.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.132
Well, maybe it's time to force his hand.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.551
What do you mean?

34:55.427 --> 35:00.307
When George Wallace refused an order
to integrate schools in Alabama,

35:00.432 --> 35:03.185
JFK had his brother
federalize the National Guard

35:03.310 --> 35:05.270
and forced him to obey the law.

35:07.231 --> 35:09.066
"Federalize the National Guard."

35:09.942 --> 35:11.902
Well, it's brilliant,
but it's also a little--

35:12.027 --> 35:12.903
Nuclear.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.404
Yeah.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.531
Hey.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.535
I don't need a nuclear solution.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.453
I need a political one.

35:23.539 --> 35:26.500
Good thing we have
a politician in the family.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.085
We'll see about that.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.170
- <i>Mr. President.</i>
- Hold on.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.509
Yeah.

35:40.389 --> 35:41.890
Okay, thank you very much.

35:44.017 --> 35:44.893
Tom?

35:46.311 --> 35:48.981
- The boy from Michigan.
- Danny Fayad.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.610
He just died.

35:57.573 --> 35:58.490
<i>Mr. President.</i>

35:59.700 --> 36:00.909
- Tell me you got him.
- Yes.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.162
Governor Royce
and Congresswoman Hookstraten

36:03.287 --> 36:05.873
are both on the board
of the American Enterprise Institute.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.749
If anyone can get him back to the table...

36:07.875 --> 36:09.209
That was smart. Good job.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.628
Okay, Mr. President.
He's coming back on the line now.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.839
- Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.093
Governor Royce.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.928
You're a hard man to reach.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.430
<i>I told you before. I'm pretty busy.</i>

36:21.555 --> 36:23.974
Well, we're gonna try
and lighten the load for you,

36:24.099 --> 36:25.017
For the record,

36:25.142 --> 36:27.102
I am ordering you
to have your police stand down

36:27.227 --> 36:29.688
and stop harassing
the Muslim community in Dearborn.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.316
I also need you to release
everybody that you've picked up today

36:32.441 --> 36:34.610
that you have not formally charged
with a crime.

36:34.735 --> 36:37.613
<i>Look, I told you before,
my police are doing what they have to do</i>

36:37.738 --> 36:39.072
<i>to protect my citizens.</i>

36:39.198 --> 36:41.283
With all due respect, Governor,
they're not your citizens,

36:41.408 --> 36:44.119
they're mine,
and it's my job to protect them.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.871
<i>It's a job you have no business doing.</i>

36:45.996 --> 36:47.789
Well, not according to the Constitution.

36:47.915 --> 36:49.041
Governor, you should also know

36:49.166 --> 36:53.295
that your police unknowingly picked up
three undercover operatives

36:53.420 --> 36:56.506
working on a long lead investigation
for Homeland Security.

36:56.632 --> 36:59.051
I can't give you their names
because it's classified,

36:59.176 --> 37:02.304
and you don't have clearance.
That is why I need you to release

37:02.429 --> 37:04.223
everybody that you've picked up today.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.099
<i>Well... I'm not gonna do that.</i>

37:06.225 --> 37:09.144
Well, then, Governor, you'll be
obstructing a federal investigation.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.855
I'm sure you're aware
of the consequences for that.

37:15.776 --> 37:18.362
<i>Look, I'm just trying
to keep my people safe.</i>

37:19.738 --> 37:21.907
How safe is Danny Fayad this evening?

37:27.871 --> 37:29.331
Governor, I need your answer now.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.795
<i>I'll call the State Police,
tell them to stand down</i>

37:34.920 --> 37:36.713
<i>and release everyone we've picked up.</i>

37:36.838 --> 37:37.714
Thank you.

37:40.676 --> 37:43.553
Mr. President, would you like me
to contact Homeland Security...

37:44.513 --> 37:46.682
tell them their agents have been released?

37:48.976 --> 37:50.394
There were no agents.

37:51.687 --> 37:52.980
It was a bluff.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.983
A band-aid to stop the bleeding for now.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.442
Well done, Mr. President.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.195
Governor Royce is a good man.

38:00.946 --> 38:01.863
He was just wrong today.

38:01.989 --> 38:04.574
- Thank you for your help, Kimble.
- Sir.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.159
Thank you, everyone.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.536
Great work.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.124
Seth, can you hold up for a minute?

38:15.127 --> 38:16.295
Walk with me.

38:19.006 --> 38:22.467
D.C. police called
the White House switchboard,

38:22.592 --> 38:24.678
wanted to confirm that you worked here.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.681
What happened this morning?

38:29.599 --> 38:31.518
What happened in Michigan.
What always happens.

38:33.270 --> 38:36.773
When people don't know who their enemy is,
they start with people who look like me.

38:40.944 --> 38:44.740
They want me to name Al-Sakar
as the group behind the bombing.

38:46.658 --> 38:51.830
But the FBI can't... confirm
with absolute certainty that they did it.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.000
So, I can't do anything.

38:55.709 --> 38:58.337
Otherwise, I'd be just as bad
as Governor Royce.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.381
We got to get this right.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.342
We will, sir.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.345
- How are you getting home?
- Sorry.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.763
How are you getting home?

39:07.888 --> 39:09.598
I can have the Secret Service drive you.

39:09.723 --> 39:11.892
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.352
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be fine.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.729
Be careful, Seth.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.065
Thank you, sir.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.691
Good night.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.319
Wyatt!

39:22.444 --> 39:23.528
Yes, sir?

39:25.489 --> 39:28.992
Could I please have the number
