00:20.187 --> 00:21.522
<i>Nice!</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:42.709
I love this belt.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.265
Only 30 minutes more TV. Okay, hon?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.813
This lamp. Sweet. Oh.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.318
Donnie's gonna be here any minute.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.280
Yeah. Whoa.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.736
Welcome home, Sean Floyd.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.574
All right, Donnie's here.
See you guys tomorrow.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.658
All right, honey.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.410
- Have fun camping, kiddo.
- Bye!

01:59.661 --> 02:02.414
<i>Oh, yeah. Ah, Ooh.</i>

02:02.497 --> 02:04.082
Oh, my God.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.375
<i>Ooh.</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:06.418
Holy shit.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.002
- What is this?
- I don't know!

02:08.086 --> 02:10.172
- Oh, my God.
- Work!

02:10.714 --> 02:13.467
- Just walk over, hit the button on the TV.
- What are they doing?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.052
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.638
What are you doing?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.223
Dude, what are you doing?
Are you serious?

02:20.307 --> 02:24.102
Sean Floyd, back on American soil
for one week only!

02:24.186 --> 02:26.438
Dude, turn that off.
My little brother is crying in there.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.231
That's crazy porn.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.399
She's a big girl.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.443
What are you wearing?

02:32.778 --> 02:34.071
They're my hiking shorts.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.281
Why do those cover your belly button
but not your balls?

02:36.615 --> 02:38.992
What's that on your face?
You spilled something on your face.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.329
It looks like you drank a glass
of Ed Sheeran's pubes.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.207
In fact, the '80s nostalgia wave
we're living in, it's about to crest.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.459
When it does, I'm gonna be swimming
in puss. Know why?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.169
Are you growing a <i>Narcos </i> coke 'stache?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.254
I am growing a <i>Narcos </i> coke 'stache,
my friend.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.964
- You're growing a coke 'stache.
- Mm-hmm.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.675
Donnie Escobar, right here.

02:54.758 --> 02:55.592
- Wow.
- That's right.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.303
How you doing, pal?

02:58.387 --> 03:00.389
- I'm good. How are you?
- Glad to have you back.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.599
Ah, it's good to be back and...

03:03.266 --> 03:04.309
Oh, we're hugging.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.195
Oh, hey, dudes.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.114
'Sup, Virgin Megastore?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.366
- Excuse me?
- Oh, shit.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.702
- Hey, Mrs. Abelar.
- Hey.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.619
Hi.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.039
Jeremy,
what are you doing over there?

03:26.123 --> 03:28.250
Jeremy!

03:28.333 --> 03:31.211
I can see
you are jerking off the walking stick!

03:31.294 --> 03:32.546
Mom, I'm packing.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.007
Your dad and I are leaving in an hour,
and I want you out of here ASAP.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.217
Okay, I'm going!

03:37.592 --> 03:39.344
Oh, God, I so need this vacation.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.888
Six hours,
I'll be in Napa with a Zinfandel.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.390
Bye, Mrs. Abelar.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.808
Look who the fuck is back.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.185
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

03:47.269 --> 03:51.273
- Yo, you dogs ready to get...
- ...fucked up?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.482
- Oh, yeah.
- Show him the ID.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.776
It's a military ID.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.611
1991, dude.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.239
- What? You buy stuff with this?
- Fuck yeah, he does.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.491
Jack Jessop reporting for booze.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.826
You don't look like this guy.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.453
This guy looks like a soldier.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.163
You look like Pocahontas.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.498
- No one says shit to an Army ranger.
- All right.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.418
I found this outside the booth
at the gun and knife show

04:11.668 --> 04:14.588
when I was picking up this bad boy.
Check it out. Check it out.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.589
Huh?

04:15.672 --> 04:16.757
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.798
Hoo-rah!

04:17.882 --> 04:19.301
- Pretty tight, huh?
- Yeah, it's cool.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.512
This is in case we run into any crazy shit
out in the woods.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.474
- Like, fucking crazy shit! Shit. Fuck!
- Whoa, man!

04:25.557 --> 04:27.225
- I'm... Sorry, dude.
- Come on, man.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.021
I try to act like I'm riding a bike,
but I still got the training wheels on.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.397
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.441
- Let's pack up the van.
- Let's do it!

04:34.524 --> 04:38.570
- Yeah, let's just get out of here.
- Let's pack it up. Hit the road.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.197
Why are there so many bags?

04:40.489 --> 04:41.573
- What is all this shit?
- Oh!

04:42.324 --> 04:47.078
Uh... Yeah,
there's a slight change of plans, dude.

04:47.162 --> 04:50.332
It sucks total donkey dick.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.834
- Stop going through my shit, perv.
- Sarah?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.337
No. No. No!

04:55.420 --> 04:57.464
No, no. No way.
No, no, no.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.841
- For real?
- Why does this feel so awkward?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.927
Jeremy, did you not tell them
that we were coming?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.806
I was... I'm telling them now.
Like, they're learning of it right now.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.933
- Are you kidding?
- They're coming.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.018
Welcome back, Sean.

05:10.602 --> 05:11.895
Hey! Hey, what's up?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.607
- Do you not hug people anymore?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.108
- They don't hug in Germany?
- Yeah.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.945
Welcome back. I mean, I'm back.
You're not back.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.364
I'm just back for the next week.
Hey, Sarah, what's up?

05:22.447 --> 05:23.532
Were you really in Germany?

05:23.615 --> 05:26.493
There was a rumor you were in rehab
for bath salts.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.578
- Everyone's talking about it.
- What? No.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.580
<i>Nein! Nein! </i> I was in Germany. Yeah.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.415
Cool hiking gear.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.209
Hmm? Oh. What?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.419
- How'd that get tucked in?
- Stop!

05:36.545 --> 05:38.213
- You're ruining my bra!
- I don't care.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.549
This shit's expensive. Stop!

05:40.632 --> 05:43.009
Jeremy said we're going six miles
into the woods.

05:43.093 --> 05:43.927
Yeah!

05:44.052 --> 05:45.595
Yeah. I'm glad you're coming, though.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.472
It's gonna be worth it
when you see me twerking

05:47.556 --> 05:49.182
with Mother Nature.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.185
Are you gonna be twerking
against a tree or...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.354
- How does that work?
- I don't know.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.023
Excuse me!

05:57.482 --> 05:59.317
This is supposed to be a bros trip.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.279
So I need a group meeting. Now! Sean!

06:02.946 --> 06:05.073
- Sounds mad. Yeah.
- I gotta go. Um...

06:06.074 --> 06:06.908
Bye.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.871
Hey, did you guys know that people think
I've been in rehab?

06:10.954 --> 06:11.830
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.041
Yeah, it's some bullshit rumor,
dude. Forget about it.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.627
Look, I'm feeling fucking betrayed
with you, J-Tron.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.170
Chad and my sister broke up yesterday,

06:19.254 --> 06:21.131
so she bailed on Cancun
with his family.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.300
- That's fine.
- Oh, what? They broke up?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.637
- That sucks.
- Yeah, she found out he cheated on her...

06:27.721 --> 06:29.723
I don't care what happened.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.684
I'm not going camping with my ex
this weekend.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.061
Wait,
I thought you guys were never "official."

06:35.145 --> 06:37.272
Yeah, that's one of our many disputes.
Thank you, Sean.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.401
Spring break. Indigonanza...

06:42.152 --> 06:45.030
- is about bros. Bonding.
- Uh-huh.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.489
Ceremoniously drinking

06:46.573 --> 06:49.951
a bottle of Indigo Caribbean Spiced Rum
in 48 hours.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.246
- That's the tradition.
- This is true.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.541
Plus, we only have Sean for one week
before he goes back to dipping his balls

06:56.625 --> 06:58.376
in sauerkraut
for the rest of the school year.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.878
That's not something we do.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.213
All right.
This is shitty for me too, okay?

07:02.297 --> 07:04.090
My girlfriend freaked out
when she found out

07:04.174 --> 07:06.217
ladies were coming
and I didn't invite her.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.095
How many times do I have to tell you?
You're being catfished.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.724
Her name is Kendall Jenners.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.517
With an S.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.978
- Not real.
- That's her name, okay?

07:17.354 --> 07:18.647
She's real, all right?

07:18.730 --> 07:22.317
We're gonna meet this summer
at theater camp and we're gonna have sex.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.320
Hey, actually, that reminds me, Sean.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.949
This weekend might actually be your chance
to bang my sister.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.117
- Whoa, whoa!
- What the fuck?

07:31.201 --> 07:34.871
She's my twin sister, okay?
We have this special connection thing.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.332
If she's having sex,
it's like if I'm having sex.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.085
- Dude, that's gro... Don't say that! Now...
- Why not?

07:40.168 --> 07:42.754
Why would you not want me to feel sex?
Sex is great.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.755
It's your fucking twin.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.173
Don't be disgust...

07:45.256 --> 07:48.593
- Jesus Christ!
- Stop pouting in there, cheddar bush.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.764
It's gonna be like this
the whole fucking time.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.516
Scared me.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.893
Here we go.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.354
- Bye!
- Bye, Mrs. Abelar.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.065
- Bye!
- Fuck you, Mrs. Abelar.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.942
Don't say "fuck you" to my mom, man.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.904
- We say "fuck you" to Mom all the time.
- Well, yeah, but she's, like, our mom.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.783
I just don't think any Abelar woman
should be disrespected…

08:12.409 --> 08:13.243
like that.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.704
Yeah.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.622
Ah, they're good kids.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.041
- They're nightmares.
- I know, hon. Let's go.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.335
- They're my suicidal nightmares.
- I know, I know.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.361
Hey, um,
I'm really sorry about Chad.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.114
Thanks.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.243
So, do you guys keep in touch at all?
Or...

08:55.493 --> 08:58.329
Oh, well, we broke up 17 hours ago.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.956
So...

09:00.040 --> 09:01.332
I'll keep you posted.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.014
Hey!

09:17.390 --> 09:19.225
Are you going to the Sadie Hawkins dance?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.351
Oh, wow, really?

09:20.435 --> 09:22.687
You know what, Sarah?
I'm gonna have to think about it,

09:22.771 --> 09:23.813
but thank you for asking.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.316
Actually, I just wanted to warn
whoever you end up going with

09:26.399 --> 09:27.734
that you shart during blow jobs.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.778
- That happened one time!
- Happened two times.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.988
You said you'd never...

09:32.072 --> 09:34.532
Dog, you sharted mid-beej?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.876
All right. Stay in the van.
Be cool. I got this.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.586
Hoo-rah!

09:52.425 --> 09:55.095
What's up?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.263
You got ID?

09:58.473 --> 09:59.724
Blammo!

10:03.103 --> 10:04.646
Hmm... Ranger, huh?

10:05.772 --> 10:07.190
$47.65.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.485
Military discount.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.364
- Stop. Wipe it on your dirty butt.
- No! Not on my... Ah! Not on my butt!

10:14.447 --> 10:15.865
Know what? Just keep the change.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.077
You have a great day. No receipt. Heh.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.558
That's not funny, man.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.228
Yeah, you're great.
Yeah, I'm just gonna put it in there.

10:45.311 --> 10:49.274
All right, guys. Let's get these
Snow Mates ready for their cover shoot.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.576
Ow.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.100
Jeremy, where are you taking us?

11:24.851 --> 11:28.521
We're going deep
into Mother Nature's puss...

11:29.272 --> 11:31.649
all the way up past the ovaries.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.110
Whoo!

11:39.908 --> 11:42.035
Kendall gets so wet for this shit.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.746
I'm sure that he does.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.186
Oh, this is it, dogs.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.355
This is base camp.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.191
Fucking finally! Jesus Christ.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.778
Oh, here we go.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.989
Here we go. Oh, what the fuck?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.415
Fuck Chad, right?

12:29.499 --> 12:31.793
Uh, yeah.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.087
High school relationships are bullshit,
anyway.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.506
I just feel really embarrassed.

12:36.965 --> 12:37.799
Yeah.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.635
But what if you tried to just...

12:40.718 --> 12:44.180
you know, do something
to take your mind off of it a little bit?

12:47.392 --> 12:48.726
You could hook up with Sean.

12:50.061 --> 12:54.023
Come on, it might be fun just to hook up
with someone that's nice for a change.

12:54.107 --> 12:58.194
Plus, you've always kind of liked him,
and he got kind of hot in Germany.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.115
I wouldn't say "hot."

13:02.865 --> 13:05.535
I feel
like he finished going through puberty.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.457
- You're blowing it with Becky.
- Man, they just broke up.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.294
This is the <i>Rent </i> cast party
all over again.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.963
This is not like the <i>Rent </i> cast party.
Okay? It's not like that.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.923
Remember what happened
at the <i>Rent </i> cast party?

13:19.007 --> 13:21.676
You sat on the couch
sipping your Mike's Hard.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.386
Her hand on your thigh.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.430
You were on the couch
and you squeezed his thigh.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.724
Then I asked if he wanted to go smoke
on the roof.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.600
Wait, yeah, what did he say again?

13:29.684 --> 13:32.270
I told her that I passed on grass.

13:32.353 --> 13:36.441
Which doesn't make any sense
because we smoke literally all the time.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.026
They literally smoke all the time.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.652
And you sat there watching as she left.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.195
I just got up and left.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.948
I told you that I couldn't stand up
because...

13:44.032 --> 13:46.909
- Maybe he just had a boner.
- I had a boner.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.077
Oh, ew.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.163
Who gets a boner
from someone touching their thigh?

13:50.246 --> 13:52.915
You're being cock blocked, literally,
by your own cock.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.542
I don't know, man. I can't control it.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.627
She then goes upstairs,
makes out with Chad,

13:56.711 --> 13:59.005
and they've been fucking dating
till this moment.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.089
The <i>Rent </i> cast party?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.425
That was your chance to be with Becky,
and you blew it.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.552
- Yeah, Donnie's right.
- Thank you.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.679
Musical theater's
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.265
That's why me and Kendall are composing
an R-rated musical

14:09.349 --> 14:11.225
based on the songs of Britney Spears.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.395
Dude, get this, all right? It's called
<i>Blonde to Bald to Back Again.</i>

14:14.479 --> 14:16.939
Shit is gonna be so fucking tight, dude.
I can't wait.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.025
I mean, you remember Christmas Eve, right?

14:19.108 --> 14:21.986
When I sang Kendall
my "Oops! I Did It Again" solo?

14:22.070 --> 14:25.782
Dude, I had to Urban Dictionary the shit
she said she was gonna do to my body.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.283
Oh, dude, I almost forgot.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.244
I got you something, dude.
It's for you and Becks.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.871
It glows in the dark and shit.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.624
What? "The Fuck King Condom"?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.751
Yeah. King of fucking, dude.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.089
Or you can go raw, dog.
I mean, I'm down to be an uncle.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.508
Stop it
with the fucking your sister stuff.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.677
As weird as this fucking guy is,
he's right about one thing.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.554
Becky's always had a thing for you.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.223
No, that's 100% conjecture.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.226
I don't know.
I'm slow-playing it, okay?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.686
You're no-playing it.
Be her rebound, okay?

14:55.770 --> 14:58.606
Take off your practice sweats
and crash the fucking boards.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.024
- Yeah.
- Play dirty.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.152
You think I didn't throw a few 'bows
to get where I am with Sarah?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.655
What?
Where do you think you are with Sarah?

15:05.738 --> 15:06.823
You guys hate each other.

15:07.657 --> 15:08.658
Donnie?

15:11.494 --> 15:12.787
Drink up, bitch.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.414
Oh!

15:14.497 --> 15:15.498
- Snap.
- Fuck!

15:15.581 --> 15:16.624
What was that?

15:16.707 --> 15:17.667
Oh!

15:17.750 --> 15:19.335
Why?

15:19.961 --> 15:21.003
Fuck!

15:21.087 --> 15:23.214
Well, nature's great,
but it's still spring break.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.258
And I'm ready to rage.

15:25.675 --> 15:26.801
Let the games begin.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.054
Actually, Sarah, this is a bros trip
that you're intruding on.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.597
Indigonanza's our thing.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.684
So I'm gonna be the one
who officially starts everything off.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.601
Okay.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.270
- Let...
- Indigonanza begin.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.357
Okay. Let...

15:41.441 --> 15:43.025
- Let Indigonanza begin.
- This is my thing.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.027
Guys, it's important to him, so...

15:45.111 --> 15:46.821
Let Indigonanza...

15:47.947 --> 15:48.781
begin.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.743
I liked it better when she said it.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.006
I mean, look at him.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.008
He's going to town
on that trail mix.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.843
Do you still have your bong bear?

16:50.968 --> 16:51.969
Yeah, I do.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.263
Get over there and make a move.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.682
You should fuck my sister.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.936
- I'm gonna piss.
- Thanks for letting me know.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.521
- Go get 'em.
- Okay.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.439
- Nice ass.
- Okay. Fine.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.275
Hey!

17:06.858 --> 17:09.278
- Quit hogging that trail mix.
- Okay.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.367
- Oh...
- Coming in.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.994
- Beep, beep, beep.
- No, that's enough. Thank you.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.795
Uh, so did you hear about the...
the bear thing?

17:27.003 --> 17:28.047
- No.
- Yeah.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.216
Here's one right now. Oh!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.093
- Whoa! What?
- What?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.136
- It's just a... It's a bong bear.
- The bear bong.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.097
Bear bong!

17:37.390 --> 17:41.936
Hey, if you wanted, we could...
we could go hot box the tent later.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.523
We could do that.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.857
- I'm free now.
- You're free?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.735
Uh, that's kind of perfect,
'cause I'm free.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.280
Yeah, our schedules lined up perfectly.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.073
- Uh, let's go now.
- Okay!

17:54.156 --> 17:55.074
- Here we go.
- Cool.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.367
Oh, my God. Did you hear that?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.452
Jeremy's talking to himself.
We gotta fuck with him.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.413
We gotta go.
We gotta go right now. Let's go.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.540
Sorry.

18:03.082 --> 18:03.916
Bye.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.501
This knife is so sharp,

18:06.252 --> 18:07.420
it can cut piss.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.256
Oh, what's that?

18:10.631 --> 18:14.051
- Are you pissing on this endangered fern?
- What the fuck is he doing?

18:14.135 --> 18:18.055
Oh, shit, it's an anthill.
I'd better get 'em.

18:18.139 --> 18:18.973
Let's get him.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.225
- We approach a wild teen.
- You're dead!

18:34.989 --> 18:37.658
- Oh, shit. I think I cut myself.
- Did you... Did you just...

18:37.742 --> 18:39.243
Oh, no!

18:39.327 --> 18:41.495
Why... why are you looking down there?

18:41.579 --> 18:43.664
Keep your eyes above... No.
What are you doing?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.249
That's not okay. That's...

18:54.300 --> 18:56.385
Where'd my dick go?
Did you see my dick, Sean?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.386
Sean, you didn't it?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.097
What about you, Donnie?
Did you see my dick?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.433
What is... What is happening?

19:02.516 --> 19:05.394
- I just cut off my dick.
- Jeremy, is this a fucking prank?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.313
Don't be stupid.
Come on, show me your dick.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.814
I cut off my dick, Becky!

19:08.898 --> 19:13.653
I cut my dick off!

19:13.819 --> 19:15.905
- Oh, my God, it's not a prank.
- Help! Help him!

19:18.032 --> 19:19.408
I don't think it'll be okay.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.077
You'll be fine, man.
We'll lay you down.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.828
Come on.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.413
Here we go. Put this under his head.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.708
Shit. That's a lot of blood, goddammit!
That's a lot of blood.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.628
- I'm gonna fucking die.
- Jeremy's gonna die.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.880
We can all stand here and have a meltdown

19:32.963 --> 19:35.132
or we can get our shit together
and save Jeremy.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.634
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

19:36.717 --> 19:39.679
- We need to call 911, now.
- Yeah, get our phones.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.682
- Kendall... theater camp.
- My phone's in the van.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.768
- Don't die.
- Fuck. I don't have any service. Do you?

19:45.851 --> 19:46.936
- I don't.
- Fuck. Me neither.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.813
- I got nothing.
- Fuck. You don't have service?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.564
Just...
Oh, give me one second to think.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.025
Okay. I'm going to the top of the ridge.
Give me your phones.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.152
Okay. One of them has to have service,
right?

19:55.236 --> 19:57.613
- What's the passcodes?
- 3-5-3-2.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.574
69-69, which is pretty ironic now.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.035
- Mine's 0-0-4-7.
- 0-0-4-7.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.829
- Go.
- What's your passcode, Donnie?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.664
- All ones, dude. All ones.
- Okay.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.835
Guys! Hey, guys, in times like these,
we... we gotta... Fucking...

20:10.918 --> 20:12.586
- Just go!
- Get out of here!

20:12.670 --> 20:15.089
- Yeah, I'm going!
- Oh, my God. Okay, Jeremy.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.968
Someone...
Someone needs to find the... penis.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.428
- Get my penis.
- Okay.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.929
- Get my penis.
- Yeah.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.806
Dude, I'm gonna get your fucking peen.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.516
I'm taking this. I'm getting a flashlight.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.810
- I'm gonna go with Donnie.
- Yeah, I'll stay with Jeremy.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.604
- It's gonna be okay, right? All good?
- It's gonna be okay. Yeah.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.732
You're gonna get my dick.
I'm gonna get my dick back.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.275
Yeah, we're gonna find it.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.820
Just for scale, what am I looking for?
Like half this? A... a quarter?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.030
I'm not gonna tell her how big my dick is.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.366
I'm gonna take it as a quarter.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.410
If this doesn't work out, Becky,

20:45.161 --> 20:46.912
- I'm gonna be your sister now.
- Okay.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.706
- You already have the hair for it.
- Yeah.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.545
Hey! That is a cliff.

20:54.628 --> 20:58.090
All right. Okay.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.800
Nope. All right, come on.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.470
Crap. No, come on! Come on!

21:02.553 --> 21:04.013
Come on! Bars! Bars! We got bars!

21:04.096 --> 21:06.682
We got bars. Oh, baby mama.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.685
All right. I can hear you now.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.645
Fuck yeah.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.065
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

21:15.316 --> 21:16.358
Hello! Hello! Hello!

21:17.067 --> 21:20.404
911. I have a medical emergency.
I need a medevac pronto.

21:20.488 --> 21:24.784
My friend has lost his penis.
He cut it off. I think it was an accident.

21:24.867 --> 21:25.701
<i>Okay.</i>

21:27.411 --> 21:30.247
Okay. Come on. Okay.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.333
Fuck.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.292
Shit!

21:36.420 --> 21:39.924
- If I was a dick, where would I be?
- You <i>are </i> a dick. That shouldn't be hard.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.091
Oh, my God.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.134
- What?
- Found it!

21:42.218 --> 21:43.219
Where?

21:43.928 --> 21:44.762
Oh.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.597
It's a pine cone.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.890
It's gotta be here somewhere.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.017
I mean,
how fucking far could this dick fly?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.603
It could be anywhere
within a thousand-foot radius.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.523
<i>Okay, sir,
I'm triangulating your current location.</i>

21:55.606 --> 21:57.191
Uh...

21:57.525 --> 22:00.569
"Hey, babe, I'm sorry I was an idiot.
Where are you?"

22:01.070 --> 22:03.906
"I bailed on Cancun.
Are you at your house?"

22:03.989 --> 22:06.116
- Oh, come on.
<i>- We're sending a medevac helicopter.</i>

22:06.200 --> 22:07.368
Okay, yes. Thank you.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.455
"I want to make this work. I miss you.
You're the shit."

22:15.084 --> 22:16.460
Crash the boards, Sean.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.631
Fuck Chad, man. Fuck you.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.551
You're a...

22:27.555 --> 22:28.472
dirty taint.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.057
Fuck, yeah.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.477
Shit.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.436
Send.

22:37.940 --> 22:38.899
Fucking send.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.194
- Send it. Come on.
- Did you get a signal?

22:44.738 --> 22:47.032
- Oh!
- Sean?

22:48.659 --> 22:50.286
Please tell me that wasn't all the phones.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.245
No, no.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.207
- I mean, yes, it was...
- It was.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.751
...all the phones.
But, hey, hey, I called 911.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.379
I talked to them. They're gonna send
a medevac in 30 minutes.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.006
- So... So that's good!
- Okay.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.424
- Yeah!
- Let's go. Let's go.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.717
That's... All right.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.971
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!

23:09.054 --> 23:10.431
It's a fucking mushroom, dude.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.517
- Everything looks like a dick at night!
- What is that?

23:14.059 --> 23:14.894
Hmm?

23:14.977 --> 23:17.479
Is that a piece of coyote scat?
Are there coyotes here?

23:19.189 --> 23:20.149
That's not shit.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.484
What do you mean?

23:22.818 --> 23:24.194
That's Jeremy's dick.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.195
Oh, my God.

23:31.619 --> 23:32.620
Damn it.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.414
I'm gonna get some sticks
to pick that up with.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.043
The medevac's on its way.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.127
We got the dick!

23:40.210 --> 23:41.712
- Yes.
- And Sarah puked on it.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.380
- Donnie!
- Sean lost the phones.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.340
What?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.550
First my dick, and now my 7, Sean!

23:48.135 --> 23:49.428
Is my pee-pee okay?

23:49.511 --> 23:51.722
- Okay. We gotta keep this warm.
- Okay.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.433
Where is it? I wanna see it. Where...

23:54.516 --> 23:55.935
Warm it up, baby. Come on.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.728
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.272
I'm keeping the capillaries open.
Stop yelling at me.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.565
You gotta put that on ice!

24:01.649 --> 24:03.776
I don't know.
They don't teach you this in health class.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.861
My dick is on a stick!

24:05.945 --> 24:07.947
- Gotta put it on some ice.
- Ice, ice!

24:11.158 --> 24:12.117
Ew!

24:30.719 --> 24:32.721
Do you think the helicopter
is gonna find us?

24:35.474 --> 24:36.433
I hope so.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.769
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.617
Is this normal?

24:53.701 --> 24:57.079
It's from his Britney Spears musical
he's writing with his fake girlfriend.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.931
Over here! Come on! Hey!

25:58.057 --> 25:59.433
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Hey!

25:59.516 --> 26:01.477
Oh, my God. It didn't see us.
It didn't see us.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.519
Okay.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.606
- This. This'll get their attention.
- What are you doing?

26:05.689 --> 26:07.149
Fuck this! Everybody run.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.026
- What? Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.903
What? Yo! Yo!

26:10.986 --> 26:13.072
Get your head down, Jeremy.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.907
Fuck you, Donnie!

26:15.282 --> 26:17.493
Oh... Okay.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.036
Guys?

26:20.120 --> 26:21.747
- What the fuck?
- Guys!

26:23.248 --> 26:24.166
Seriously?

26:24.917 --> 26:28.003
Wow, Donnie, I am so impressed.
This is some of your best work.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.726
Becky! Becky!

26:43.852 --> 26:47.022
- What the fuck!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:47.397 --> 26:49.483
Damn, that was dope.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.734
- You okay?
- No.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.152
Holy shit. That was crazy.

26:52.236 --> 26:55.114
Oh, hey! It worked! Hey, we're here!

26:55.197 --> 26:58.575
- Let's get the dick. I got it. Let's go.
- Let's go, Jeremy.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.078
Oh, hey!

27:01.411 --> 27:02.788
Hey, guys. Come on!

27:06.542 --> 27:08.377
- Hey, look! Hey!
- Hey!

27:08.460 --> 27:09.419
- Hey!
- Hi.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.713
Hey!

27:13.882 --> 27:17.219
We'll get him to East General Hospital,
ASAP.

27:17.302 --> 27:21.014
As long as it's within twelve hours,
a severed member can still be reattached.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.266
- Yes!
- Okay, thank you.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.059
Your friends did a good job.
You're gonna be okay.

27:24.143 --> 27:24.977
Thank you!

27:25.060 --> 27:27.563
Whose idea was it
to set off the fireball?

27:27.646 --> 27:28.856
That was all me, dude.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.274
You're a fucking idiot!

27:30.357 --> 27:32.609
We saw you guys on our initial approach.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.988
Hike down to your car
and you can meet him at the hospital.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.657
Okay. Okay, okay. Hey.

27:38.740 --> 27:42.411
You're gonna be okay. Yeah.
We're gonna see you at the hospital, okay?

27:42.494 --> 27:45.330
Becky, you need to shut the fuck up.
You're wasting time. We gotta go.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.456
Okay, yeah! Yeah!

27:46.540 --> 27:48.417
- He's not gonna die!
- He's gonna be fine.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.337
Stay strong, Jeremy!

27:52.421 --> 27:53.797
Bye, Jeremy.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.469
Look. He's reverse-<i>Terminator</i>- ing.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.721
That's epic.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.893
Okay. He's gonna be okay.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.395
Oh, my God. Thank God.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.610
- He's good.
- He's good.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.366
Whoo!

28:43.263 --> 28:46.475
- He really lost a lot of blood.
- Yeah, man, I'm covered.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.853
Can I propose a little toast
to the first responders?

28:50.020 --> 28:51.772
- Yes.
- May the heroes that...

28:54.024 --> 28:56.026
- Guys?
- What?

28:56.193 --> 28:58.111
- What?
- Guys!

28:59.071 --> 29:00.322
What? Ah!

29:01.281 --> 29:04.243
- What is it?
- What?

29:08.705 --> 29:09.581
Sean?

29:09.957 --> 29:12.209
You gave the EMT the wrong cooler?

29:12.834 --> 29:15.379
No! No, no. No way.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.965
- Wait. Wait, we have the dick!
- Donnie, no!

29:18.048 --> 29:19.841
- Wait! Come back!
- Oh!

29:19.925 --> 29:23.011
- Oh, shit!
- The ice...

29:33.563 --> 29:34.898
We have my brother's dick.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.734
With no ice and no phones.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.321
- We have 12 hours, right?
- Yeah, I think the EMT meant if it's,

29:41.405 --> 29:42.322
you know, on ice.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.741
Oh, shit! Oh, wait. They... they...

29:44.825 --> 29:46.034
They also told us to hike down.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.744
They probably don't think
we're here anymore.

29:47.828 --> 29:50.163
Shit. Look, I'm willing to wait and see.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.374
But by that time,
Jeremy's dick is gonna be rotten

29:52.457 --> 29:53.417
and have flies on it...

29:53.500 --> 29:55.836
No, no, no, no, we can't freak out.
Don't freak out.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.170
We'll hike down.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.466
We'll... We'll find someone with ice
or a phone along the way.

30:01.717 --> 30:02.968
And worst case,

30:03.302 --> 30:06.763
we'll be back in the parking lot
in, like, six or seven hours.

30:07.681 --> 30:08.765
This is gonna work.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.186
Yeah, okay, Becky's right.
Let's do this.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.022
This is gonna work.
That's a good plan.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.234
Okay, let's leave our shit.
We'll move faster.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.278
- Okay. It's gonna be a long way.
- Okay, let's go.

30:21.695 --> 30:22.529
Okay.

30:25.449 --> 30:29.328
Hey, stay with us.
Don't head for the light!

30:29.411 --> 30:30.537
Hang in there, buddy.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.206
We got a male. Severed penis.
Cut clean to the base.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.292
- Oh, shit.
- What?

30:35.375 --> 30:38.128
There's no penis.
It's just two cans of Flittson.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.296
My dick isn't in there?

30:39.880 --> 30:42.716
Just cans. There's literally no penis.
It's just two cans of beer.

30:43.008 --> 30:47.179
You guys, where's my dick?

30:52.059 --> 30:53.727
I don't think this is a good plan.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.064
I told Becky it was. We've been hiking
for over an hour, and there's no one.

30:57.147 --> 31:00.692
Of course it's not a good plan.
There are no good plans in this situation.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.235
Look, um...

31:02.361 --> 31:03.445
- Dude.
- What?

31:03.570 --> 31:05.572
- Uh, he texted her.
- Who texted her?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.032
- Chad.
- What?

31:07.157 --> 31:09.034
When I was calling 911
from Becky's phone,

31:09.117 --> 31:10.452
Chad texted,

31:10.535 --> 31:11.828
and said he wants
to get back together.

31:11.912 --> 31:14.122
- <i>Rent </i> cast party, man.
- Yeah, I, um...

31:15.123 --> 31:16.583
Oh, man, I think I fucked up.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.252
I, like,
I think I texted him back as her.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.255
Whoa. That is epic.
What did you say?

31:22.339 --> 31:25.217
I said, "Fuck you,"
and then I called him a dirty taint.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.718
Guys! Guys?

31:27.219 --> 31:29.096
We're gonna stop and pee really quick.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.848
Ginger Pablo Escobar,
please keep your eyes downhill.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.975
Ha! Hope you pee on your shoes.

31:34.643 --> 31:35.727
People are noticing.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.687
It still looks like you blew
Chester Cheetah.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.272
- Oh, shit!
- What?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.400
- Is Donnie coming to perv on me?
- No.

31:41.483 --> 31:42.734
Hey, Sean!

31:43.068 --> 31:46.071
Sean, there's a ranger lookout station.
They might have ice.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.906
Hey, that's good.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.408
That's awesome. Let's go.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.291
Let's go!

31:59.835 --> 32:00.710
Hello?

32:01.086 --> 32:03.296
- Hello, anybody?
- Hello?

32:04.256 --> 32:05.715
- Hello?
- Hello?

32:06.216 --> 32:08.593
We need some help! It's an emergency!

32:08.677 --> 32:09.845
- Excuse me?
- Hello?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.221
Hello?

32:11.304 --> 32:12.347
Is anybody home?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.307
Seems like we have to break into
this bitch.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.809
What? We're not doing that.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.561
I don't know.
This is government property.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.854
I feel like it would be...

32:18.937 --> 32:20.105
a bad idea.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.065
Damn.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.985
But, yeah, you know,
this is a time-sensitive case

32:25.068 --> 32:26.820
so it's a good call. It's a good call.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.370
Mm, it's empty.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.580
Great.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.252
Please have ice. Please have ice.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.421
Oh, dude. No, close that.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.426
Well maybe there's still a phone
or radio or something, right?

32:49.509 --> 32:50.802
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.894
Oh, my God!

32:58.977 --> 33:00.520
Oh, my God!

33:05.275 --> 33:06.818
- Oh!
- No, no, no.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.904
I think the rattlesnake bit the dick.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.031
Oh, my God. A snake bit the dick?

33:11.114 --> 33:12.866
We have to get the venom out somehow.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.826
- Yeah. How do we do that?
- We have to get it out.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.496
Maybe if we shake it a lot,
the venom will pour out.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.872
No, we have to, uh...

33:21.833 --> 33:23.543
Someone has to suck it out.

33:27.130 --> 33:31.092
It seems only fair that the person who's
had that dick in their mouth do it.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.555
Donnie,
what the fuck are you talking about?

33:36.348 --> 33:39.184
- I'm obviously referring to Becky.
- What?

33:39.267 --> 33:43.104
You guys shared a womb together,
so obviously at some point in the dark...

33:43.230 --> 33:45.482
- that dick went in your mouth.
- This idiot.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.859
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fumbling around.

33:47.943 --> 33:51.571
Donnie, I didn't suck his fetus penis
when I was in the womb.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.031
I am his sister.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.075
I am obviously the last person
to suck the dick.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.744
- You're sucking before I do.
- I'm sucking...

33:57.827 --> 33:59.829
I am not sucking my brother's dick.
End of story.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.332
The women should suck the dick.
We don't even know how.

34:02.415 --> 34:06.127
It's not even the same kind of sucking,
you stupid idiot.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.755
- I am not going to do it!
- You should. This is your fault.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.882
- Yeah, you should.
- I'll do it.

34:12.259 --> 34:16.471
I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll suck it!
I will suck the dick.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.724
I lost the phones.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.018
I gave them the wrong cooler.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.188
I'll suck the penis.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.775
- It's really cool of you. Thanks.
- Yeah.

34:29.109 --> 34:29.985
Just, uh...

34:31.444 --> 34:32.779
I'd like to do it...

34:33.947 --> 34:34.947
alone.

34:35.532 --> 34:36.574
Yeah, you got it.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.368
- I'll tell your story.
- Okay.

34:38.994 --> 34:39.953
You're a hero.

34:40.036 --> 34:40.911
Yup.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.004
You da man.

35:19.075 --> 35:19.909
Thanks.

35:24.581 --> 35:27.000
Man, we came all the way up here
for nothing.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.588
I really fucked this up. I'm sorry.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.924
What now? We're just gonna run down
this mountain and pray that J-Tron's D

35:35.008 --> 35:36.509
doesn't fester before the car?

35:37.677 --> 35:39.804
We've only been hiking for three hours.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.515
That means we still have nine hours.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.935
That was before it got bit by a snake.

35:47.854 --> 35:48.688
You guys hear that?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.067
Dude, look!

35:52.984 --> 35:53.860
A drone?

35:54.736 --> 35:56.154
Wait a minute. Wait.

35:56.571 --> 35:57.405
If there's a drone,

35:57.489 --> 36:00.450
that means there's a person,
and they probably have a phone.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.703
We should... We should follow it.
Let's go get Sean.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.748
Sean! Sean, there's a drone... Oh!

36:08.124 --> 36:10.543
- Don't look at me!
- Sorry. Sorry.

36:10.627 --> 36:14.422
Uh, it's just... There's a drone,
so there's people, and we need to go now.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.424
Oh, my God. That's great. Okay. Um...

36:16.508 --> 36:20.303
- Just... Stop looking.
- One second. I gotta...

36:20.387 --> 36:22.180
I'm getting a lot of venom
out of this thing.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.269
Hey!

36:31.898 --> 36:33.066
Come here!

36:34.234 --> 36:35.193
There. Get it.

36:35.985 --> 36:36.861
Stop!

36:40.573 --> 36:42.867
- Where'd it go?
- Does anybody see it?

36:45.286 --> 36:46.621
Oh! There it goes.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.039
I got this shit.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.035
- Sarah!
- Oh, shit!

37:26.119 --> 37:26.953
Fuck!

37:27.036 --> 37:29.873
- Oh, my God! Oh!
- Fuck!

37:30.165 --> 37:31.833
I got it!

37:32.542 --> 37:35.044
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, totally!

37:35.754 --> 37:38.423
- There are people there. They have a boat.
- Nice!

37:38.631 --> 37:39.758
Watch this.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.261
Let's get wet!

37:43.344 --> 37:45.013
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.768
- Holy fuck.
- Whoo!

37:49.851 --> 37:50.769
Yeah!

37:51.227 --> 37:52.812
- That was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.023
Yeah. It looks easy.
He made it look easy!

37:55.106 --> 37:57.400
- Yeah. Do... do you wanna go next?
- Yeah!

37:57.734 --> 37:58.860
Yeah, yeah. No, I'll go.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.280
Hey, I get the feeling
that you maybe don't wanna jump.

38:02.363 --> 38:05.575
So, uh, we can try to find
a way to hike down.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.203
- No, I wanna... I want to go.
- Okay.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.829
<i>Es geht um die Wurst, ja?</i>

38:09.913 --> 38:11.998
Which means "it's do or die" in German.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.917
Actually,
the literal German translation is,

38:14.000 --> 38:15.919
"it's all about sausage," which is funny...

38:16.002 --> 38:18.254
Are you making a dick joke right now?
We, like, gotta go.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.923
Yeah. Obviously. Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.049
- Let's do it.
- All right.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.302
I'm not gonna take the long way,
I'm gonna take the Sean way, huh?

38:24.385 --> 38:26.095
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

38:26.179 --> 38:28.348
- Fuck! Oh, fuck.
- Oh!

38:34.729 --> 38:35.772
Yeah!

38:36.314 --> 38:39.275
I'm good! I'm good! Whoo!

38:41.528 --> 38:44.447
So, the "Sean way" is going for

38:44.614 --> 38:47.033
the maximum amount of pain
you can inflict on your body?

38:47.116 --> 38:48.952
No, no.
Honestly, it didn't hurt that much.

38:49.035 --> 38:52.455
It was actually really fun.
I actually... It was a fun ride.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.998
Ooh.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.542
Oh, my God.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.044
Dude, uh, your back is like...

38:58.837 --> 38:59.671
red raw.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.593
Oh my... Oh, my God.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.637
Oh, fuck me.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.763
You guys, look.

39:09.389 --> 39:10.348
Huh?

39:11.599 --> 39:14.686
Oh! That's so dumb.

39:14.769 --> 39:18.231
They fucking came back.
And we're not there. That's awesome.

39:18.314 --> 39:21.276
Ow!

39:21.401 --> 39:24.821
- Damn it!
- All right, man! Jesus. We're all mad.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.739
No, the wind blew against my back.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.408
It's okay. I'm fine.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.202
What?

39:31.911 --> 39:34.914
You guys, come on. Let's...
Let's just keep going.

39:40.253 --> 39:43.131
- The helicopter went back to the campsite.
- Yes.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.216
- But your friends weren't there.
- No.

39:45.675 --> 39:49.596
So, the doctor's gonna need to operate
before this gets infected.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.264
Okay. No, my friends,

39:51.347 --> 39:53.725
they'll... they'll get me my penis back.
I know they will.

39:53.808 --> 39:58.062
Okay, I know they will, too.
If they don't, though, you'll be fine.

39:58.479 --> 40:02.525
We can do a full penal reconstruction
using a graft from your forearm or glute.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.110
The results are fantastic.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.195
- Really?
- Absolutely.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.281
In addition to increased self-esteem,

40:08.364 --> 40:10.658
most patients report
successful ejaculation

40:10.742 --> 40:12.327
in ten percent of sexual encounters.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.246
On a pleasure scale,
we're hitting mid-to high-threes.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.539
Is that good?

40:16.789 --> 40:18.291
Those numbers sound bad.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.210
Well, in comparison
with not having a penis,

40:21.294 --> 40:22.795
I think those numbers sound great.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.131
Okay. I will wait for my dick.

40:25.798 --> 40:29.052
I have a strong dick.
I know it'll last days out in the wild.

40:29.135 --> 40:29.969
No.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.847
Everyone thinks their penis is special.
It's not.

40:32.931 --> 40:37.185
Okay? It's like one of these flowers.
Right?

40:37.727 --> 40:41.189
If you remove it from the body,
cut off its flow of blood,

40:41.689 --> 40:45.652
and then eventually,
if left on its own, it will wilt...

40:46.444 --> 40:47.278
and die.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.828
HBO's on Channel 3.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.210
Come on, guys.

41:03.169 --> 41:06.673
I know you're doing whatever it takes
to get here as fast as you can.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.801
Hey, Becky!

41:09.884 --> 41:14.347
Hey, don't beat yourself up
over the helicopter.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.558
I think you're doing great.
I've always thought you were really great.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.812
Uh, are you forgetting the time
you totally rejected me?

41:21.270 --> 41:24.065
That never happened.
I don't remember that happening.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.276
Come on.
Remember the <i>Rent </i> cast party?

41:27.735 --> 41:30.113
- Kinda made a move.
- I... might remember.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.533
I had a momentary crush on you.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.454
- You had a crush on me?
- I just thought...

41:38.538 --> 41:40.540
Sean, emergency bro discussion.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.375
- One sec, man.
- 911, Sean.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.877
- You better go. Sounds very important.
- Sorry.

41:44.961 --> 41:48.256
Sean, Sean, you are not gonna believe
what I found in the woods.

41:48.589 --> 41:50.883
Wait till you feast your eyes on these.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.220
What are those? Why do you have those?

41:54.679 --> 41:57.098
When Sarah went behind that big bush
to dry off or whatever,

41:57.181 --> 41:58.891
I went after her, 'cause I needed to pee.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.769
Okay, I find those waiting on a rock.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.354
For me.

42:03.646 --> 42:05.023
Knew she came to win me back.

42:05.106 --> 42:09.485
What? Maybe she just didn't want to wear
wet underwear, you psychopath.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.612
That's like serial killer behavior.

42:11.696 --> 42:12.864
Okay, these are a sign.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.992
She wants us to be together.
And you know what, Sean?

42:16.075 --> 42:18.036
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm ready to forgive her.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.412
Forgive her for what?

42:19.787 --> 42:21.748
Over Christmas break, usual spot,

42:21.831 --> 42:23.166
abandoned church
my grandma used to take me to.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.543
Before we start hooking up,
I throw around I want a DTR.

42:25.626 --> 42:28.046
- She freaks out.
- DTR?

42:28.129 --> 42:29.547
You said you wanted dick to rim?

42:29.630 --> 42:32.425
No. What?
I wanted to "define the relationship."

42:32.508 --> 42:34.969
- What the fuck is dick to rim?
- I don't know. Butt stuff.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.138
What has happened to you in Germany?

42:38.431 --> 42:41.309
Anyway, I tell her I wanna DTR.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.686
And she's all like,
"Relationships are bullshit."

42:43.770 --> 42:45.772
Then I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to do.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.483
So I kick her out of a car...
may or may not have been moving.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.110
- Wow, that's really mean.
- I also told her...

42:51.194 --> 42:52.779
um, that I never liked her.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.364
- Wow, man.
- And she was gaining weight.

42:59.035 --> 43:01.245
Sean! This is a power play.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.538
She wants me back.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.624
Come on, Donnie.
The camp's around this bend.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.003
- Hi! Hello. Hey, bud!
- Hey, buddy.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.588
- Hey, there.
- Hey, hi.

43:10.671 --> 43:12.048
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.591
- Whoo!
- Hey.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.259
I believe this belongs to you.

43:15.343 --> 43:19.222
And I believe you're the bitch
that fucked it up!

43:19.305 --> 43:20.431
- What now?
- Whoa.

43:20.515 --> 43:22.600
You better have cash to pay for this.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.269
Okay, uh, where are your parents?

43:25.353 --> 43:27.438
My dad went fly-fishing.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.565
What about the boat? Where are the keys?

43:29.649 --> 43:32.068
Because we're in an emergency,
and we need some help.

43:32.193 --> 43:36.489
All right. If I'm gonna give you the keys,
then I wanna see some stuff.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.700
Okay.

43:39.784 --> 43:42.829
- No. Ugh.
- We are not going to show you our boobs.

43:42.912 --> 43:43.996
Bitch, please!

43:44.372 --> 43:46.290
I'm 11, not five.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.168
I've seen thousands of titties.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.629
I wanna see you two scissor.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.048
- Yeah!
- Oh!

43:54.132 --> 43:56.884
- Take that, you little perv. Gross.
- That is inappropriate.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.137
I'm not helping you with shit!

43:59.470 --> 44:01.222
Stay the fuck away from me!

44:02.098 --> 44:04.559
- Kid's a monster.
- Jesus Christ.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.477
I kind of love him, though.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.855
Okay, if we're not outta here in,
like, an hour…

44:08.938 --> 44:11.357
- Jeremy will be dickless...
- The rest of his life.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.192
That's decades with no dick.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.278
No. We need that boat.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.488
Fuck this little baby Bieber wannabe.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.198
What are you doing?

44:19.991 --> 44:22.785
Listen here, you little terrorist.
This is my brother's dick.

44:23.119 --> 44:25.538
He's in the hospital right now,
and he needs us.

44:25.621 --> 44:29.000
We need your boat so we can get
to the hospital to reattach it.

44:29.500 --> 44:33.087
Listen, kid, when we're around,
dicks get cut and dicks get sucked.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.630
I saw him suck this dick.

44:34.714 --> 44:37.300
I sucked that dick this morning.
Now, give us the keys.

44:40.094 --> 44:40.928
Yes!

44:41.345 --> 44:45.391
All right. Tell your dad the boat's
gonna be at the south campground lot.

44:45.474 --> 44:47.476
Jesus, Sean,
that dick really fucked him up.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.645
He hasn't said a word
since you showed him the dick.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.272
What if he never talks again?

44:53.316 --> 44:55.318
- Whatever. Fuck this kid.
- The worst.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.652
Piece of shit, anyway.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.490
Hey, buddy.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.411
Son are... Are you okay?

45:06.204 --> 45:07.622
Dicks get cut.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.875
Dicks get sucked.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.796
- All right. I got you.
- Okay.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.757
Good God. Hey!

45:17.840 --> 45:19.842
- Hey!
- Oh, shit!

45:19.967 --> 45:23.387
- Oh, my God! Go!
- Guys, we gotta go!

45:23.471 --> 45:26.557
- Go! Shit! There's too many keys.
- I'm getting the anchor.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.435
Hello, sir, I can completely explain
what's going on here.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.395
What have you done to my son?

45:31.479 --> 45:33.189
It's a good thing you're...
Okay, fuck this.

45:33.272 --> 45:35.107
I'll kill all of you perverts!

45:40.446 --> 45:42.531
Hey, he has a bruise. Leave him alone.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.116
You're a fucker!

45:44.200 --> 45:46.160
Hit me again. I fucking dare you!

45:46.244 --> 45:49.330
Oh, my God. Ugh. Go.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.207
Let's go! Come on! Move!

45:51.332 --> 45:52.291
I got it!

45:52.375 --> 45:54.001
I'm gonna kill you, son of a bitch.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.169
Back the fuck up!

45:55.920 --> 45:58.005
Oh, fuck.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.841
Oh, God. It's slipping, guys!

46:00.925 --> 46:03.886
Shit! He's <i>Cliffhanger</i>- ing!
Oh, hold it, Sean.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.264
Fucker!

46:06.347 --> 46:08.432
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- I got it.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.771
- Fucker!
- Auf Wiedersehen!

46:13.854 --> 46:15.439
Hey! That's my boat!

46:15.523 --> 46:16.983
Come back with my boat!

46:17.650 --> 46:20.319
- Holy shit.
- Whoo!

46:21.487 --> 46:22.822
That was insane.

46:23.322 --> 46:26.075
- That guy tried to murder us.
- Yeah. He was crazy.

46:26.242 --> 46:29.787
I mean, in all fairness,
he probably thought we molested his kid.

46:29.870 --> 46:32.540
I shouldn't have said,
"Dicks get cut and dicks get sucked."

46:32.623 --> 46:33.666
That was too much.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.210
Nice going, pinch hit.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.255
Yeah, thanks.
I learned from the best.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.843
When you nailed me in the head
with a beer can.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.804
Oh, yeah. That was awesome.

46:49.890 --> 46:54.854
By the way, I got your sign and...
message received.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.939
- My sign?
- Yeah.

46:58.733 --> 46:59.567
Look familiar?

47:01.110 --> 47:05.156
If I'm wearing your underwear,
that means you're not wearing any.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.533
Those aren't my underwear.

47:08.701 --> 47:09.994
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.370
Man, that's gross.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.748
- Okay, don't tell anyone.
- I...

47:13.831 --> 47:15.958
I really appreciate that you tried.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.378
I think we're actually gonna make it
to the hospital in time.

47:19.462 --> 47:21.422
- We're a good team.
- Yeah.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.845
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.849
Time to cooler it up. Whoo!

47:44.403 --> 47:46.155
Let's find Jeremy
and get some ice.

47:46.238 --> 47:48.657
- Get that dick to the hospital!
- God! Donnie!

47:48.741 --> 47:49.617
Oh, my God.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.119
It's all crumbed. Like a churro.

47:52.578 --> 47:55.206
- Oh, my God. We made it!
- Let's go get some ice.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.123
Yes!

47:59.460 --> 48:01.712
Let's go! Let's go!

48:04.673 --> 48:08.302
I have read the literature,
and I've come to the conclusion

48:08.386 --> 48:10.805
that I do not fucking want this, okay?

48:11.180 --> 48:12.556
- I don't want a butt dick.
- Hey!

48:13.182 --> 48:16.519
Don't you yell at me. I'm not the one
who got drunk and... Pfft.

48:16.602 --> 48:19.397
Ob... Obviously, you don't have a dick.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.565
No, I don't have a dick!

48:21.899 --> 48:23.734
No one in this room has a dick.

48:25.361 --> 48:26.195
Right?

48:26.987 --> 48:28.864
- Yeah.
- Okay.

48:35.996 --> 48:37.998
Let's hope they're on their way.

48:42.086 --> 48:43.671
Think we should call
your parents?

48:43.754 --> 48:45.423
What's your mom's number?

48:46.132 --> 48:47.299
Uh, it's... Uh...

48:49.218 --> 48:50.594
I don't know it.

48:51.011 --> 48:52.763
- At all? No?
- No. Mm-mm.

48:52.847 --> 48:56.892
I don't know. I just programmed them
into my first phone. I was 11.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.562
We can maybe check if they left a message
on your phone.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.397
<i>Don't leave a message, just text me.</i>

49:02.398 --> 49:04.650
<i>You have one new message.</i>

49:04.733 --> 49:07.361
<i>Fuck</i> you, <i>Becky.
You're the taint.</i>

49:08.195 --> 49:09.822
- Is that Chad?
<i>- You hear me?</i>

49:09.905 --> 49:11.073
- Um...
<i>- You're the real taint.</i>

49:11.157 --> 49:12.241
<i>I'm glad this is over.</i>

49:12.616 --> 49:14.160
<i>You deserve to be alone.</i>

49:14.452 --> 49:18.080
<i>I want you to take that note I wrote you
our four-month anniversary and burn it.</i>

49:18.164 --> 49:19.748
<i>I don't mean any of that anymore.</i>

49:19.832 --> 49:20.749
<i>Ah!</i>

49:20.833 --> 49:22.877
<i>You made me so mad,
I dropped my vape!</i>

49:23.252 --> 49:26.672
<i>You owe me a new vape, Becky.
You hurt my feelings, dawg.</i>

49:29.592 --> 49:31.844
Becky, um,
I have to tell you something.

49:32.136 --> 49:33.179
When... Um...

49:33.512 --> 49:37.516
- I'm really sorry, but...
- What? No, no. It's not your fault.

49:38.225 --> 49:39.602
It's just really fucked up

49:39.685 --> 49:43.105
how someone you thought cared
about you can lie to your face.

49:46.066 --> 49:46.942
Yeah. Yeah.

49:55.910 --> 49:58.954
Wow. Damn.
Girl, you are a really good driver.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.789
- Thanks.
- God.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.375
You're like a young Furiosa.

50:14.678 --> 50:16.972
All right, man, we gotta get this dick
on life support.

50:17.056 --> 50:18.933
- We need bags and ice.
- Oh, my God, dude.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.726
This looks like a cat shat in a cooler.

50:20.809 --> 50:22.436
- Oh, shit.
- Ugh.

50:22.561 --> 50:23.854
Should we... Should we clean it?

50:23.938 --> 50:26.857
I'm fucked if I know.
What do you even clean a dick with?

50:26.941 --> 50:28.359
Doxycycline.

50:29.276 --> 50:30.194
Or a Z-Pak.

50:31.737 --> 50:34.156
I've had everything in the book.
It works. Trust me.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.867
Which one of you's is it? You?

50:37.993 --> 50:38.827
You?

50:39.745 --> 50:40.829
Or is it the ranger?

50:40.913 --> 50:44.250
Yeah, actually it is for the...
the young, uh, ranger.

50:44.333 --> 50:46.126
We need stuff to clean his wound.

50:46.669 --> 50:47.962
A wounded soldier?

50:48.504 --> 50:50.965
Um... We need to clean his, uh...

50:56.303 --> 50:57.137
Penis.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.807
Three inches. Severed at the base.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.184
I've seen this before.

51:02.935 --> 51:03.894
You have?

51:03.978 --> 51:07.565
It would be my honor and a privilege
if I could do this for you.

51:10.776 --> 51:11.860
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.946
Let's do it!

51:15.030 --> 51:16.240
All right, let's go.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.783
He's been in this situation.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.660
If we're gonna trust someone,
it might as well be this guy.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.082
Whoa, whoopsie.

51:49.898 --> 51:51.567
His dick's gonna be even better.

52:03.412 --> 52:04.747
Wow.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.374
Fresh ice. Good as new.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.669
Oh, wow.

52:11.795 --> 52:12.921
That is amazing.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.214
Yup.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.550
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

52:17.426 --> 52:18.427
Good luck, soldiers.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.928
- Hey, yeah.
- Oh, hey.

52:20.220 --> 52:23.098
If you need anything, this is my card.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.603
- Let your sergeant know what happened.
- Absolutely. Will do.

52:27.686 --> 52:29.313
Yeah. What the hell's that?

52:30.022 --> 52:31.190
It's just my wallet.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.986
- Ow!
- Crestview High School.

52:36.654 --> 52:37.738
Junior.

52:39.615 --> 52:40.866
The hell's going on here?

52:40.949 --> 52:43.077
It's just a really old high school ID.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.203
Says it's from this year.

52:44.286 --> 52:46.038
- Does it? Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

52:46.121 --> 52:47.373
- Okay.
- Fuck.

52:50.334 --> 52:53.712
Did you boys lie about being servicemen
so you could buy alcohol?

52:53.796 --> 52:55.631
No. No, absolutely not.

52:55.714 --> 52:58.634
There is no way we would ever lie. It's...

53:02.680 --> 53:04.890
Our... Our friend Jeremy, he lied.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.477
You mean,
I just cleaned a civilian dick?

53:08.560 --> 53:11.063
- I am so, so sorry.
- Stay cool, man.

53:11.146 --> 53:13.023
- Get the hell over here!
- Fuck.

53:13.107 --> 53:14.525
- Go, dude! Go!
- Come back here.

53:18.696 --> 53:20.489
We have got to go!

53:21.281 --> 53:22.241
He looks mad!

53:22.324 --> 53:24.159
- Go!
- Oh, come on. Okay.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.537
- Here it is! Unlock!
- Unlock the door, Becky.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.914
- I'm pressing unlock.
- Open the door.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.378
Shit! He's got a fucking bow and arrow!
Go!

53:34.461 --> 53:38.590
The only dicks that I touch
are mine and my husband's.

53:39.091 --> 53:40.217
Go! Shit!

53:40.300 --> 53:42.928
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

53:43.637 --> 53:44.555
Hey!

53:44.638 --> 53:46.640
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

53:46.724 --> 53:48.142
- That was crazy.
- God.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.144
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.479
Guys, we made it.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.985
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! Holy shit!

53:58.068 --> 53:59.027
Fuck you!

53:59.486 --> 54:01.071
Yeah, fuck you!

54:01.155 --> 54:03.157
- Holy fuck! Are you okay?
- Ow...

54:03.282 --> 54:05.576
You look okay.
Looks like just the tip went in.

54:05.659 --> 54:08.162
Come on, Donnie. You love just the tip.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.122
Fuck, that's really funny,
but not right now.

54:13.208 --> 54:16.295
Did you say Kendall Jenners? With an S?

54:16.378 --> 54:18.839
We're supposed to meet
for the first time this summer.

54:18.922 --> 54:21.508
That name is like Catfishing 101.

54:21.592 --> 54:22.593
Why does everyone say that?

54:22.676 --> 54:24.636
She likes to text.
She doesn't like talking.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.263
That is definitely a catfish.

54:26.847 --> 54:28.974
Okay, look. Anyway, if I'm gonna die,

54:30.017 --> 54:33.353
I need her to know...
that I love her.

54:33.437 --> 54:36.440
You're not gonna die.
You just won't have a penis.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.442
I'd rather die than not have my penis.

54:38.525 --> 54:39.943
We've waited all day.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.904
It's been almost 12 hours.

54:41.987 --> 54:43.739
We haven't heard anything
from your friends.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.158
- Yeah, but there's still time.
- Nah.

54:46.450 --> 54:49.161
Look at the flower. Look.
It still has most of its petals.

54:49.787 --> 54:52.289
What? No. Dude... The flower...

54:52.623 --> 54:54.041
that was an example.

54:54.124 --> 54:57.711
Did you think that that flower
was magically linked to your penis?

54:59.671 --> 55:01.840
This isn't <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

55:01.924 --> 55:05.719
But me and my friends are fucking idiots.
They're gonna need more time.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.805
Honestly, it's not looking good.

55:08.013 --> 55:11.475
So, let's just hope your friends
are arriving right now.

55:17.481 --> 55:20.317
Hi! Hi! We're here for Jeremy Abelar.

55:20.818 --> 55:23.028
We have a... a special delivery.

55:23.403 --> 55:25.239
Uh, one moment.

55:25.447 --> 55:27.324
- Abelar? Abelar.
- Abelar. Yes.

55:27.449 --> 55:28.909
A-B-Oh... Ooh...

55:28.992 --> 55:31.161
I just gotta go back here.

55:31.245 --> 55:33.330
That's it.

55:33.747 --> 55:35.582
Ah! Yep.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.668
Ah, we don't have a patient
under that name.

55:38.085 --> 55:41.713
Uh, the helicopter EMT said
they would be bringing him here.

55:41.797 --> 55:43.507
I don't know what to tell you.
He's not here.

55:43.590 --> 55:44.925
They sometimes reroute medevacs.

55:45.008 --> 55:47.219
I'd try Clarkson Memorial.
They have a helipad.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.143
Fu...

56:00.107 --> 56:01.108
...ck!

56:01.233 --> 56:03.402
Let's go.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.364
Go, go, go, go, go!

56:09.616 --> 56:11.368
Everybody, listen up!

56:11.618 --> 56:13.704
There is a penis in this cooler!

56:13.787 --> 56:15.497
Are we in the right place or what?

56:15.706 --> 56:16.748
Is that the penis?

56:16.832 --> 56:18.166
- Yes! Yes!
- Thank God. Yes.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.711
Oh! We didn't think you guys
were gonna make it.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.547
The penis is here!

56:23.839 --> 56:26.633
Page the anesthesiologist.
I want to get into surgery immediately.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.552
- Yes!
- Hey!

56:30.721 --> 56:31.805
You guys did good.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.600
Ooh! Also, it got bit by a snake.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.978
I sucked it pretty good,
but you should still check for venom.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.733
Prep the OR!

56:42.816 --> 56:43.901
Goddamn hero.

56:44.359 --> 56:47.154
Yes!

56:47.237 --> 56:49.531
- Yes! Oh, God.
- Ow! Oh, ow!

56:49.615 --> 56:52.075
- Someone's thumb went in my hole.
- You okay?

57:00.834 --> 57:03.170
You can scoot closer.

57:04.129 --> 57:05.964
You're kind of far away.

57:06.048 --> 57:07.257
Yeah.

57:11.970 --> 57:14.139
Hey, thank you for your shirt, also,
by the way.

57:14.222 --> 57:15.557
Oh, yeah, no problem.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.393
- It's comfortable. It smells good.
- Looks great on you.

57:18.477 --> 57:19.311
Thanks.

57:27.194 --> 57:29.279
Hey, um, you know what? Uh...

57:30.864 --> 57:34.242
Remember at the <i>Rent </i> cast party?

57:35.619 --> 57:39.331
- Mm-hmm?
- I actually had a crush on you, too.

57:46.838 --> 57:47.839
You... you did?

57:49.424 --> 57:50.258
Yeah.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.470
Yeah, also momentarily.

57:54.805 --> 57:55.973
- Um...
- Right.

57:56.848 --> 57:57.766
Yeah, I mean...

57:58.392 --> 57:59.476
I don't know.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.359
Wow, the Fuck King?

58:08.485 --> 58:11.154
The Fuck... Are you the Fuck King?

58:11.822 --> 58:14.074
Uh, no, that's not me.
I'm not the Fuck King.

58:14.574 --> 58:16.576
- Just a fuck prince.
- I wouldn't even...

58:16.994 --> 58:18.412
I think I'm more of a jester.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.663
- You're a fuck jester.
- Yeah.

58:20.038 --> 58:21.289
That's... that's more fun.

58:21.790 --> 58:24.418
You wanted to use it at the hospital here?

58:24.960 --> 58:26.336
Well... Um...

58:28.922 --> 58:32.718
Jeremy actually gave it to me
to use with you.

58:33.593 --> 58:36.179
- And I said, "That's crazy."
- That's really weird.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.682
- I'm on the same page. It's weird.
- I'm his sister.

58:38.765 --> 58:40.100
So it's not really mine.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.269
- Ew! Ew!
- I know! I know!

58:42.978 --> 58:44.229
- Why?
- Yeah.

58:44.396 --> 58:46.481
- The Fuck King? Come on.
- I know. It's weird.

58:46.940 --> 58:50.277
I mean, it's not like you still
have a crush on me.

58:53.697 --> 58:54.948
Do you still have a crush on me?

58:58.493 --> 58:59.661
- Excuse me.
- Wha...

58:59.745 --> 59:01.830
Come with me.
The doctor would like to see you.

59:01.955 --> 59:04.416
- Okay, yeah, great. Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

59:04.499 --> 59:07.335
Um... Donnie. Hey.

59:08.086 --> 59:09.671
The doctor wants to see us. Let's go.

59:10.088 --> 59:12.007
- Okay.
- Were you just...

59:12.090 --> 59:13.300
God damn.

59:15.844 --> 59:17.512
- Sean. Let's go.
- Yeah.

59:18.513 --> 59:21.558
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my...
Yeah, I'm on my way.

59:23.685 --> 59:25.270
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

59:25.353 --> 59:28.273
I lost something. I can't remember...

59:28.815 --> 59:29.691
if I...

59:30.942 --> 59:33.403
- Sean, do you have a boner?
- I don't have a boner.

59:33.487 --> 59:34.988
Just my back hurts, and...

59:35.489 --> 59:36.406
So...

59:36.782 --> 59:40.452
basically every time you touch Sean,
he gets a raging bonie.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.915
See? I told you. You give him boners.

59:44.998 --> 59:45.874
What?

59:47.125 --> 59:48.251
I don't have a bonie.

59:51.630 --> 59:52.589
Did you just fart?

59:52.672 --> 59:53.673
No, it was the seat.

59:53.757 --> 59:56.093
Oh, my God. Do you have the farts
and a boner?

59:56.176 --> 01:00:00.555
- I don't have farts or a boner.
- One of those is a lie.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:03.934
- Let's... You got it. You got it.
- Do you, buddy.

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:06.186
- Thank you.
- Shocking, man.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.187
Thanks.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.952
Good news. Surgery went perfectly.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.328
Oh, my God.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:24.996
Well, not perfectly.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.873
But as good as we could have hoped.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:30.335
We have a successful reattachment,
and your friend's gonna be fine.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.712
What about the snake venom?

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.422
There was no venom in the penis.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.675
Yeah, man. You sucked that shit out.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.760
No.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:41.930
- There was <i>never </i> any venom in the penis.
- Huh?

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:44.391
It's impossible to suck venom
out of a bite wound.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.726
It was a defensive bite.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.061
Whatever, man.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.772
- Don't listen. He doesn't know shit.
- Yeah.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:52.399
Right. I'm just a doctor.

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:56.486
Anyway, your friend whose dick you sucked
for no reason

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.865
is gonna be under a bit longer,
but you can go in and see him.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:02.367
Sure he'd love to wake up
to some friendly faces.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:04.911
Salty.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.916
Here we go.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.168
All right.

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:12.919
Let's do it.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:25.932
Who's this?

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:30.312
Um, hi, excuse me. Nurse.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:33.982
The doctor told us the wrong room.
We're looking for Jeremy Abelar.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.401
Jeremy... Abelar.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:40.113
No, we don't have a Jeremy Abelar
in recovery.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:43.241
The doctor told us that he transferred
from surgery.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:46.119
Let's make this simpler. It's the guy
that got his wiener reattached.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.580
Yeah. That's him. Reginald Knudson.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:51.124
- No, no, no.
- The other person for a severed penis.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.042
Yeah.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:57.088
If there was somebody else here
with a severed penis, trust me, I'd know.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:02.135
If... if Jeremy's not here, then...

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:05.138
We gave someone else Jeremy's penis.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:06.556
What?

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:08.934
That's our friend's dick?

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.685
That's our friend's dick.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.396
- That's our friend's dick! Oh, my God.
- That right?

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.565
- What kind of fucking hospital is this?
- Security!

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.237
You have my friend's penis.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.656
Hang on for one second.
It's a simple mistake.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.867
It's an honest mistake, I'm sure.
But you guys have the wrong penis, okay?

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.619
You have the wrong penis and...

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.581
You all saw that!
You're witnesses!

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.166
- Are you okay?
- That's a felony!

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.086
All right, we need to figure out
if there's a head of the hospital

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.380
and explain the situation and see if...

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:41.091
And what?
They'll just grow him another dick

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.926
with their magic dick-making machine?

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:47.681
- I'm not just gonna give up.
- You have no idea where Jeremy is.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.599
It's pretty obvious we're done.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:50.725
That's awesome, Donnie.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.186
Sarah, I'm sorry.
Can you tell your boyfriend or whatever

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.605
to stop throwing a little baby boy
tantrum right now.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:59.943
Maybe I should be more like you.
Right? Manipulate things.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.655
Make 'em go my way.
Like what you did with the medevac.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.074
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you talking about?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.661
Uh, while your brother was lying there,
maybe about to die, uh...

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:13.540
Sean was pretending to be you
and texting Chad from your phone.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.834
Sean.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:17.877
Sea... Sean?

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:19.796
Are you serious?

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:23.258
- You...
- It was... It was an accident. I was...

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.969
How is texting my boyfriend
as me an accident?

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.721
You guys weren't even
technically together.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.390
What? What? What did you say?
What did you say to him?

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:35.020
I said, "Fuck you. We're done."
And then I called him "dirty taint."

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.480
Wow.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:39.566
- Yeah.
- Um, okay.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.526
The... the voicemail?

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.196
The voicemail he sent me.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:49.284
I, um... I need to... I need to go.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.829
- I'm sorry. I need to borrow your phone.
- No. What the hell?

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.706
You do not want to fuck with me
right now!

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.960
Just messaging Chad
and telling him to pick me up.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:00.378
Becky...

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.217
Of course, he's online. Okay.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:07.886
He's coming to pick me up.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.137
Thank you.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:10.847
Sarah, let's go.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:21.483
Becky! Becky!

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.609
Becky.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:26.321
Use the twin connection.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.448
Find me.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:32.243
If you can hear me, please hurry up
and come and save me.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.204
Becky!

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:36.498
Nope, it's me Darlene. Hello.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.375
Um, so...

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.418
we got you an operating room.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.669
I'm telling you, lady.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.171
My friends are close.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:45.882
And I'm telling you, it doesn't matter
if they're close.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:50.845
By now, unless your penis somehow got
fresh, oxygenated blood in it,

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.264
it's dead.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:57.560
No, no, no, no! Don't.

01:04:57.644 --> 01:04:58.645
Oh, my God.

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:02.816
There's no point in waiting any longer
for trash to arrive.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:05.360
Okay, fine.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.779
Let's do the butt-skin dick.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.906
A graft is no longer an option.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.533
- What?
- Do you smell that?

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:14.327
You know we don't serve blue cheese
in the cafeteria, right?

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.495
That... that is...

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.288
That's your hole.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:18.665
I'm sorry.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.043
The anesthesiologist will be in shortly.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.924
Wow. So this is really happening.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:34.013
I can't believe I shat on your chances
with Becky.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:37.725
Yeah, it's my own fault.
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.352
Uh, no.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:44.566
Also, I'm really sorry I started the rumor
about you going to rehab for bath salts.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.067
What? That was you?

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:49.195
I feel like we both now know
I have problems with abandonment.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.405
- Yep.
- I can't believe

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.157
I found a dick in the sewer.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.535
Believe it, young'un.
You just got your dick cherry popped.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:56.828
Gonna need a new cooler.

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:58.830
- Fuck.
- Dude.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:02.208
- Yo. Yo, yo, yo.
- They have the redneck's dick.

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:03.835
If...

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.296
we can get it to the doctor...

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:11.509
then the doctor can reattach it
and we can get Jeremy's penis back.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.470
We haven't been good friends
to each other.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.847
- I feel like I've been a good friend...
- But...

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.807
we can be best friends for Jeremy.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:19.601
Let's do it.

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:32.697
Hey, man.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:34.407
Who the hell are you?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.952
- I said no visitors.
- Uh, I'm really sorry.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:40.788
There's something that you should know
about...

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:42.874
your penis.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.710
Er, I mean, it's not <i>your </i> penis...

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.171
You have our friend Jeremy's penis.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.256
What the hell are you talking about?

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.842
- They put our friend's penis on you.
- Yes, they did.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:57.055
Like, not like when I was out,
they put your friend's dick on my face...

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.183
I don't know, maybe that happened.
But then they sewed it on you.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:06.481
You're gonna see right away
it's our friend Jeremy's penis.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.609
Oh, my God.

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.402
That is not my dick.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.238
That's not your dick.
It's what I said.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:15.907
Why? Why? Why is it so ugly?

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.534
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.119
Where did they find this?
A little Navajo boy?

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.454
It's a normal-looking dick.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.581
Once the swelling goes down,
it's gonna get smaller?

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:26.876
Are you fucking kidding me?
How am I supposed to work with this?

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.713
Ugh. You two again? Hey!
Am I gonna have to call security?

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.632
Oh, hey, it's Dr. Malpractice.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:35.301
Guess what? You sewed the wrong dick
onto the wrong body.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.762
If you don't want us to fuck
your world up, you listen.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:41.140
Two water sanitation workers just came
into the hospital with his dick.

01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:43.351
- What? My real penis is here?
- Yeah, man.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:45.562
What we need you to do
is reattach 'em.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:49.774
Guys...
You don't just pop 'em on and off.

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.609
It's a delicate operation.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.486
It's not a fucking LEGO set.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.322
That dick is staying on that body.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.617
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm stuck with this...

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.620
- this thing?
- Hey, man.

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:03.871
That thing...

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:05.790
that fucking thing...

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.502
belonged to a goddamn majestic person.

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.337
And you need to respect

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.632
that you got a part of my friend
on you now forever.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.051
Okay? You got a piece of Jeremy.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.636
It's a good dick.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.473
You need to honor that penis.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:26.685
And bring it as much joy
as Jeremy brings us

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.688
every time you take it out.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.274
Because it belonged to a great dude.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.191
The best.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:35.903
You guys seem like
some really good friends.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.616
I wish I would have listened to my buddies

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.327
when they told me
that Cheryl was a psycho bitch.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.078
Never would have let her tie me up.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.413
I thought she just wanted to get freaky.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.207
- Maybe do some butt stuff.
- That's awesome.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.501
Anything goes, you know?

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:54.631
She put on her sexy little
Juicy Cooter slip.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:58.593
Got my rod all hard.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:08:59.594
Cool.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:02.388
She started licking all up in my ear,
you know.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.390
Saying sexy sweet nothings and whatnot.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.769
And she leans in and she whispers...

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.564
"I know about you and my sister."

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.944
Yeah, and then she whips out
a pair of scissors... and bam!

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.822
She snips my dick clean off.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.573
- Yep.
- And then she flushed it.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.493
She flushed my pee-pee like a poo-poo.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.246
She sounds like one bag of trash.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.247
Yep.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.332
You know what the craziest part is?

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.671
I still love her.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.214
There it is.

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:39.591
You know, I know it's just
a dirty toilet dick but, doctor...

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:44.721
I'd like to give these two young men
my old penis.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.892
- That's awesome.
- You know, that might work.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.685
Yeah. Because...

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.649
everybody deserves a second chance.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.734
Even me?

01:09:58.486 --> 01:09:59.362
Cheryl.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:03.241
Oh, baby. I'm sorry, baby.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.243
Baby, I'm so sorry.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:08.204
No, baby, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was doing.

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.790
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:15.753
I just went in. I... I grabbed 'em
and I snipped it.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:18.840
You got through it real easy, too.
I was surprised.

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.466
Can you ever forgive me?

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.927
If I could suck it back on, I would.

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.513
I know it was the drugs.
I know it was the drugs.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.223
You know it was the drugs.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:28.725
- Baby.
- Yeah?

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:31.853
- And how about a little kiss?
- Yeah, okay.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.522
That feels good.
Little kisses of an angel.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:37.400
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.279
- Baby. Oh, I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.447
- Let's go.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.533
- You're my king.
- The scepter has been repaired.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:47.827
When's little Reggie
gonna be ready for me to...

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.037
Hey, guys! Guys, guys! Look...

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.624
I think they can attach Reginald's penis
to your friend.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.420
Okay? It's in the cold storage.
One floor up, end of the hall.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.005
Take my key card.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.883
- Why aren't you coming?
- "Why aren't you coming?"

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:05.052
How about I don't want to get sued?
If they ask, I'll tell them you stole it.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.430
Wow. That's so great of you.
You're so nice.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.307
Oh!

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:10.224
Oh, <i>Scheiße!</i>

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:11.809
What the fuck did you do that for?

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.562
So they believe we stole the key card.
I don't know.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:17.315
I have a super fucking sensitive nose,
you guys.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:20.234
Why? Why?

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.986
Oh, my God!

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:24.447
- Holy shi...
- Oh, my God!

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.364
She cut it off again!

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:29.827
I did, 'cause you don't deserve no cock,
you cheating son of a bitch.

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:32.288
Oh, you fucking crazy ho bag!

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:34.582
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! We need that!
- It's my cock!

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.083
It's my dick.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.340
- Jesus!
- Oh!

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.467
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna cut it up

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.719
like a little three-year-old's lunch.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.847
- She will do it. Trust me.
- I'll do it. I'm crazy!

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.599
Oh! You're crazy, lady!

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.520
Ow! Where'd she go?

01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:57.647
Where is she?

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.023
Oh, my God.

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:01.734
- Oh, fuck!
- What the fuck?

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:05.530
I don't care how many times
you reattach it, Reggie.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.950
I'm gonna find you, I'm gonna cut it off,

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:12.537
and I'm gonna flush it every time.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.747
- Don't you dare.
- Get it, Donnie! Get it, Donnie!

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.082
She'll do it.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:19.502
Cheryl, give me that.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:26.676
Oh!

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.930
Blow it down! Blow the dick down.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.891
I got you now.

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:38.479
Whoa! Whoa!

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:40.273
- Wait a minute, baby!
- What?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.691
I love you.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:45.903
I love you too, Reggie.
Why do you think I'm doing all this?

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:47.321
Security!

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.534
- Mission accomplished, bitch!
- God damn it!

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.119
Oh!

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.124
It was just supposed to be camping.

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.753
- Oh, fuck.
- I'm gonna pick it up.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:06.340
I'm gonna flip it like dog poop.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.847
Well, boys, I guess you get your wish.
You got your friend's dick back.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.974
Thanks! Let's go. Come on.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.309
Good luck, boys!

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.019
Oh, shit.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.106
You okay?

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.237
- Oh, hey, it's the girls. It's the girls.
- What?

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.074
Hey.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.243
What's going on?

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.871
We... we have Jeremy's penis.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.831
Thought it got sewn on to that other guy.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.791
- Oh, it... It did.
- Well, yeah.

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:49.258
'Sup, babe?

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:50.718
It's fucking Chad.

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:02.188
Here. Take... take it.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.359
I know you're done with me,
but the receptionist said

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.444
there are five other hospitals
Jeremy could be in.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:12.865
We're gonna drive around and call around
and see if we can find out where he is.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.368
And if we figure it out before you...

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.538
I will text you. I'll text... Chad.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.416
As me this time, not as you.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.170
Do it.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:30.216
You know what, I am really sorry
that I sent that text.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.551
But you deserve to be with somebody
who respects you.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.306
Not somebody who cheats on you.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.270
You're amazing, and I really like you.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:44.939
And I've always liked you.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.693
And not...
always... I haven't...

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:51.320
I don't, like, like you like a lot.
Like a lot, a lot.

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:53.906
I just think you're cool,
and I think you think I'm cool,

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.867
and that we're cool together.
And it's cool that we...

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.619
have this thing and...

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.372
You know, I am not trying to make...

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:10.464
God. Oh, no, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:12.758
Don't worry, I put it in a baggie
like dog shit.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.677
It's still pretty gross.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.470
- Ugh.
- Sorry.

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:19.765
Ugh.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:25.771
Anyway, I'm really sorry
about everything and...

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:29.150
I hope that you can forgive me.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:32.403
Yeah.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.326
- Come on down, babe. Let's go.
- Great.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:40.745
One sec.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.748
Why the fuck did I message Chad?

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:46.584
Come on. Let's go.

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.254
We're going to save Jeremy.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:54.216
You guys coming or...

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:57.845
What? So, my speech was good?

01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.096
No.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:02.266
But, hey,
I think I got what you were trying to say.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.145
You messed up. You're sorry.
I deserve respect.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.730
We like each other.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:09.815
Yeah.

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:11.025
I got it.

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:15.946
- Cool.
- Let's go get Jeremy his dick back.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:18.240
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.912
- 'Sup, babe?
- Sorry, Chad, we're broken up. Bye.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:25.790
- 'Sup, Chad?
- What the fuck? Are you serious?

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:27.333
I drove all the way out here!

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:28.918
Your loss, Becky.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:32.254
I even got a fake ID
so we could drink margaritas in Cancun.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.257
- Wait. Holy shit. Stop the car.
- What?

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.884
- What?
- Stop the car. Stop.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.719
- I know how to find Jeremy.
- How?

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:41.013
Jeremy bought us booze on the drive
out to the mountains.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.056
So, what?

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:45.101
The military ID was the one in his wallet.
His fake!

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:48.979
Oh! The hospital admitted him
under the name on his fake ID.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:52.233
Jack motherfucking Jessop!

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:53.484
What the fuck?

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.194
- Holy shit.
- I'm calling it in.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:58.197
- Which hospital? You said there were five.
- East General. The first place.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.200
East General Hospital?

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:05.579
Hi, can you connect us to Jack Jessop,
please?

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:06.622
One moment.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.755
<i>And connecting you now.</i>

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.216
- Yes.
- Yes! No, yes!

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.137
Just relax.

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:23.639
And count back from 100.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.975
We'll be back shortly to take you
into the OR.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:37.194
- Hello?
- Jeremy!

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.154
Jeremy!

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:40.781
Becky, where are you guys?
They're trying to sew up my nub.

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:43.617
No, no, no! Tell them no.
We're gonna be there soon, okay?

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.202
Please tell me you have my pee-pee.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:46.412
We have it!

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.206
- Yes.
- Please, I just want my pee-pee back.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:52.042
- Stop calling it your pee-pee.
- The doctor, Becky.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.545
He said it's too late.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:58.465
<i>They pumped me with a lot of drugs,
and now they're taking me to surgery.</i>

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:00.551
- Ooh, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:01.635
Don't. Hold off.

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.513
- Nurse. Nurse.
<i>- We're gonna be there really soon.</i>

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.349
<i>- Do not let them take you into surgery.</i>
- Hi, Grandpa.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.811
- Oh, shit.
- We gotta go.

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:13.314
- Yeah, we gotta.
- We gotta go. We gotta go.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:20.696
Oh! He is out.
Let's get him into surgery.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.532
Say night-night to <i>The Danish Girl.</i>

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:32.625
Let's go!

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:35.044
Come on!

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.371
No!

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:01.839
Yes!

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:28.490
Stop! Stop the surgery! I have the dick!

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:37.082
Oh, shit.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:43.255
Um, excuse me?

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:48.969
I think this belongs to him.

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:03.609
Look, I'm really sorry that I freaked out
when you tried to ask what our deal was.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.782
But if you're still interested,
maybe we could DTR sometime.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:10.741
Yes.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.369
What? Yeah. No, yeah.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.454
- That was a really quick answer.
- What?

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:16.413
That'd be cool.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.501
I can't wait, Sarah.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:24.630
Me too, Donnie.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.886
Just to clarify, we're talking
about "dick to rim,"

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.763
not "define the relationship," right?

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:37.643
I'm kidding.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:46.735
Well, this is probably
my last moment of freedom.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.029
As I'll be grounded
for the rest of my life.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.365
I'm really sorry your parents
are gonna kill you.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:52.783
Oh, no. It's fine.

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:56.161
I mean, the rest of this year
is gonna be super boring, anyway.

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:58.747
Someone I know is going back to Germany.

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:09.091
- Uh... nope.
- Oh.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.343
Uh, I'm sorry, I just...

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:15.514
I just remembered that you had
my brother's dick in your mouth earlier.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:18.225
Uh, so maybe...

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:20.269
maybe we should wait.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.020
Okay, yeah.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.021
That makes sense.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.232
- Totally makes sense. I'm on board.
- Cool.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.530
- Don't.
- Oh.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.740
- Still got dick lips.
- Still... Yeah.

01:22:33.824 --> 01:22:36.076
- Dick mouth.
- Yeah.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.872
- Can you smell the dick? Okay.
- No. No, no, no.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:41.957
- It's just the image of it. Yeah.
- Right.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:02.102
- Jesus. What do you have in here?
- I got a lot of stuff. I got books.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.270
Books on what?

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:06.064
- Books on Germany.
- Don't they have those books in Germany?

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.359
- All right, this is it.
- Yeah.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.779
Really think your brother's
gonna miss you, bro.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.698
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.742
Make it stop!

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.119
- Make it stop!
- What the fuck? Seriously? Again?

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:20.204
- It's so good!
- Stop!

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:23.165
You have to protect your Wi-Fi,
Mr. Floyd.

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:25.501
I don't know how!

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:28.086
Turn it off, man.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:30.214
What? Is this my ride?

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:32.174
- What?
- What is this thing?

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.262
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:39.973
- Ready to go?
- Yeah! Oh, yeah.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:41.725
Sean, good luck finishing rehab.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:43.894
- Ha!
- Thank you.

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.356
I know I said I'd drive you
to the airport, just us,

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.358
but someone got out of the hospital early.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:02.871
What's up?

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:04.248
Dude!

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.791
- Cool.
- That's so sick.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.000
What's up, dogs?

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.920
Jeremy insisted that our parents rent him

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:11.922
a wheelchair van.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:15.592
It's like we have a dumb Stephen Hawking
just rascaling around the house.

01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:17.553
- Heh.
- I cut my dick off.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:20.097
Fucking pimp, right?
I look like Professor X.

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.557
"Scott, you're a chump.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:24.434
Logan's been tapping Jean since day one."

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.019
Oh, yeah.

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:29.690
Hey, Sean, also, don't tell Kendall
about S-ing my D.

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:32.484
She's already pissed she can't be riding
this dragon, you feel?

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:35.112
Right, yeah, she would be pissed
if she were real.

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.205
Hey, guys. I'm Kendall.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.417
Jennersss.

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:52.004
Thanks for making sure Little J
made his way back home.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.172
- Little J.
- Oh, our pleasure.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:57.301
- She calls it Little J? Disgusting.
- I gotta give you two kisses.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.553
- Okay. Two more kisses, but just two.
- Okay.

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:03.390
Kendall, I told you just two!
You're gonna rip the stitches.

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.183
I'm sorry, I just love you so much.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:06.852
Why did you fuck with the ramp?

01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:09.104
You gotta get back in.
We're going to the airport.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:10.772
Fuck me! All right, yeah.

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.441
- Let's get back in the van.
- Come on.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:13.817
Nice meeting you guys.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.652
- Get back in the van.
- Let's roll.

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:17.613
- Okay.
- You got this. Come on, babe.

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:21.408
Bye, Jeremy's girlfriend. Hope you enjoy
his Franken-peen when it's healed.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.368
Franken-peen's funny.

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.329
- Good, right?
- Come on. Keep it up.

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:26.330
I love you, babe.

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:29.041
- I love you too, babe.
- #metoo, babe.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:33.712
So, I could drive you to soccer practice
if you wanted.

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:35.380
Yeah.

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:38.091
Maybe we can stop by
the church parking lot on the way.

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:43.013
Yeah, absolutely. Yes. Yeah.
Thank you. Is it weird to say thank you?

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.140
- Little bit.
- Yeah, it's strange.

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:46.808
All right.

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:48.935
So I wanted to...

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.562
give you something...

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:54.399
when I dropped you off at the airport,
but now we got these two tagging along.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.442
Ah, bummer.

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:59.905
Yeah,
but what I wanted to give you was, um...

01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:02.449
Give you this.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:04.493
Oh.

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:06.078
The Fuck King.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.538
What is the Fuck King
without his condom crown?

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:10.540
Wow. Returns.

01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:14.044
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know... I don't know why I...

01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:15.087
Right, yeah.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.469
Oh, my God.

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:25.347
You know
we can see you, right?

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:30.143
Yo, Jeremy, Sean's tonguing your sister
pretty hard right now.

01:26:30.227 --> 01:26:32.854
What? Hold on. I'm missing it.
I'm missing it. Hold up.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.690
You know he had a dick
in his mouth?

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:37.150
Yeah, well, in 20 minutes,
I'll have a dick in mine.

01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:41.947
What? What? Really?

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:43.657
No.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:45.867
Great. Thanks.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.372
- Yo, can you see them?
- I can't, babe.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:51.498
I gotta get out.

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.875
- Becky!
- Go, Sean. Take it horizontal.

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:57.212
- Stop making out with him!
- Okay, I'll just do it myself.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.005
Oh, my God.
He's gonna get a boner.

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:00.674
Yeah!

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:03.677
- Babe?
- Wait.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.929
- Jeremy!
- Get back in the car.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.682
- Jeremy, get back in the car.
- You're gonna get dirty.

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:10.642
Get it, Becky!
This is her choice.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:12.686
Jeremy,
it's not like you can't walk.

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:15.939
- Your legs are fine.
- What are you doing? Oh, my God!

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:18.108
Hips! Use those hips, girl!

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:21.361
Jeremy, stop being
so fucking weird. It's your sister.

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:23.739
Oh, my God, babe.
How's Little J?

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.325
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna grab my own ass.

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:29.536
And then, Becky,
tell me if you feel it, too.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:32.914
- There's no twin connection, dude.
- Oh, here we go.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.040
It's beautiful.

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:37.502
I thought it'd be weird
to watch your best friend make out, but...

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:39.421
I'm getting into it.

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:43.091
You guys, this is awesome.
But I think I fucked up my stitches.

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:45.927
- I told you to be careful.
- Let's cut to the music.

01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:12.157
There's some trail mix
in my teeth right now.
