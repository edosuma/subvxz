You there, which way
to Pepperinge Eye?

03:08.100 --> 03:11.800
Couldn't say, sir. lt said on the
wireless to paint out the signposts

03:11.900 --> 03:14.500
in case the Nazis drop in.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
l'm not a Nazi!
l'm a British officer!

03:16.900 --> 03:20.700
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.900
Drive on, corporal.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.500
Sorry to give you so many
but you do have six bedrooms.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.300
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away

03:48.400 --> 03:51.300
from those terrible
bombings in London.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.800
What about us?

03:56.900 --> 03:59.700
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.300
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.900
Charles.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.900
Paul.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.600
You're for Miss Price.
l'm expecting her in.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.600
- <i>Call out the navy</i>
- l won't be a moment.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.400
Please don't touch anything.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.800
<i>Call out the tanks</i>

04:17.899 --> 04:21.899
<i>From the Cliffs of Dover,</i>
<i>call up the gulls</i>

04:22.000 --> 04:26.300
<i>And don't forget</i>
<i>the loyal territorials</i>

04:26.400 --> 04:30.300
<i>But who's digging in here?</i>
<i>Who will defend</i>

04:30.400 --> 04:34.400
<i>Every inch of England,</i>
<i>no matter what they send?</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:38.500
<i>Who's standing firm</i>
<i>in our own front yard?</i>

04:38.600 --> 04:42.700
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,</i>
<i>that's who</i>

04:42.800 --> 04:46.800
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard</i>

04:46.900 --> 04:51.200
<i>We wrote the story</i>
<i>of the old brigades</i>

04:51.300 --> 04:55.300
<i>We know the glory</i>
<i>of yesterday's parades</i>

04:55.400 --> 04:59.300
<i>Who's standing firm</i>
<i>in our own front yard?</i>

04:59.400 --> 05:03.300
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,</i>
<i>that's who</i>

05:03.500 --> 05:08.300
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard</i>

05:09.700 --> 05:12.700
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.700
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

05:15.800 --> 05:17.900
here to check military preparations.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.700
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.100
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?

05:32.500 --> 05:35.600
Good morning, General.
l received your message, Mrs Hobday.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.400
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
How lovely.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.700
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.000
Her late father served with me.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.700
What does she burn in this?
lt smells like sulphur.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.900
Ridiculous! One can't make
motor fuel out of sulphur!

05:53.000 --> 05:57.600
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.700
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?

06:00.800 --> 06:05.800
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.100
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.000
Are we to have
the pleasure of meeting him?

06:14.100 --> 06:17.000
l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.100
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.800
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.000
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!

06:29.100 --> 06:31.100
Stop it this instant!

06:32.400 --> 06:34.800
Children, this is Miss Price.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.300
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins,
all the way from London.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.500
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?

06:40.600 --> 06:44.800
The government are trying to evacuate
children into the country.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.000
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.900
And l've had to find homes
for all of them at very short notice.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.200
These are the last three. All right,
children. Pick up your things.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.300
You're not suggesting l take
these children into my house?

07:02.400 --> 07:06.400
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.500
Children and l don't get on.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.300
l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.700
Be quiet.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.500
Besides, l have important work to do.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.500
Miss Price, you do have
that entire house to yourself.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.900
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.300
l see.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.800
lf that is the case
l shall take them into my house,

07:27.900 --> 07:31.700
with the understanding that you find
another home as soon as possible.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.500
Fine. Come along.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.800
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!

07:41.900 --> 07:44.700
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable
thing you are doing,

07:44.800 --> 07:47.200
taking in these
poor unfortunates from the city.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.900
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.400
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.500
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.300
My parcel, please.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
Bring your things inside.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.100
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.200
Not another house
round here for miles.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.000
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.900
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.900
lt suits my purpose.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.100
All right. Come along, everybody.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.400
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.400
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.200
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!

09:08.100 --> 09:11.700
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names.

09:11.700 --> 09:15.800
l call him Cosmic Creepers
because that's the name he came with.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.900
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.200
Be very careful of everything in it.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.000
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.000
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.200
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.700
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.900
Travel light, that's us.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.800
l don't think this is going to work

09:37.900 --> 09:40.000
but it seems
that l have no alternative.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.100
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.300
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.600
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?

09:48.700 --> 09:51.800
You will wash yourselves
otherwise there will be no supper.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.100
ls that clear?

09:55.500 --> 09:58.800
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.300
Please don't bother to whisper.
l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.500
You are planning
to run back to London.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.800
Please do your plotting elsewhere

10:13.900 --> 10:15.600
where l shan't have to listen to it.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.300
l don't know much
about what children eat.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.300
You'll have to make do as l do.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.800
ls there anything in particular
that you fancy?

10:22.900 --> 10:25.500
Sausage and mash,
bubble and squeak,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.500
toad in the hole, fried fish...

10:27.600 --> 10:29.100
Anything at all.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.100
You won't find any fried foods
in this house.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.800
- No fried food?
- No.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.000
How do you keep your health?

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
Cabbage buds, rosehips,

10:37.800 --> 10:42.900
hyssop seed, elm bark,
wattle yeast and stewed nettles.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.800
''Dear Madam. With this shipment,

11:37.900 --> 11:40.500
the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft

11:40.600 --> 11:42.400
sends you its
congratulations

11:42.500 --> 11:45.800
on qualifying for the first degree
of your chosen calling.''

11:45.900 --> 11:49.500
''You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.''

11:50.500 --> 11:53.200
''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''

11:59.900 --> 12:02.000
My first broom.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.100
Time to go. Everybody up.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.400
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.100
Let's see how we fly this thing.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.800
Here we are.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.100
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''

12:22.800 --> 12:24.900
Yes, of course.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.500
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.000
''A witch is always a lady unless
circumstances dictate otherwise.''

12:38.100 --> 12:41.500
''Take an easy, graceful
sideways position.''

12:41.700 --> 12:46.100
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
There we are. How's that?

12:50.700 --> 12:53.500
''To start up the broom,
your basic formula:

12:53.600 --> 12:57.300
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!''

12:59.600 --> 13:01.700
l wasn't ready!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.100
Now watch this.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.600
Here we go.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.800
lt's going to be
a little different this time.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.700
All right. l know it's not ladylike.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.400
What's the matter?

14:55.800 --> 14:58.000
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.600
That's the sort of thing witches do.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.400
She don't fly good, do she?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.100
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!

15:29.200 --> 15:32.700
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.100
Look out!

15:42.100 --> 15:44.700
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.100
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.100
A witch she is, says you.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.700
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.200
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.600
She don't want anyone
to know she's a witch, does she?

15:59.700 --> 16:02.700
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.700
And l intend to make
the most of it. Come on.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.000
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
Very healthful, l'm sure!

16:12.700 --> 16:16.100
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.800
Lovely weather for flying last night.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.800
Why did you say that, Charles?

16:29.900 --> 16:32.900
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.900
l see.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.600
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.800
Thank you. l should be most grateful
if you didn't tell anyone.

16:46.900 --> 16:50.900
Course there would have to be one
or two little changes made round here.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.600
l mean, l'd like to see an occasional
sausage on the table here.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.200
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!

16:57.300 --> 17:00.500
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.400
There will be no more of this wash,
wash, wash, morning and night.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.500
Anything else?

17:06.599 --> 17:10.000
Now you mention it,
l could do with a bit of lolly.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.400
Lolly?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.900
Cash. Cold, hard cash.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.300
You must have buckets of it.

17:17.300 --> 17:21.500
The most accomplished of witches
can't make money out of thin air.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.200
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?

17:24.300 --> 17:28.500
Be that as it may,
you don't want us to blab, do you?

17:28.600 --> 17:31.600
Have you considered
what danger you might be in?

17:31.700 --> 17:34.400
l am a witch, you know.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.600
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?

17:37.700 --> 17:40.100
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.

17:41.100 --> 17:44.900
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.400
Very well, Charles.

17:49.100 --> 17:52.400
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.300
She can't even ride a proper broom.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.500
Excuse me, Charles.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.300
Filigree, apogee,

17:59.400 --> 18:02.600
pedigree, perigee.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
Oh, Charlie!

18:07.200 --> 18:09.500
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!

18:09.600 --> 18:12.200
Bother! l never seem
to be able to manage toads.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.100
Stop! Leave him alone!

18:21.200 --> 18:24.600
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.400
l'm just an apprentice witch.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.400
Look out, Charlie!

18:47.800 --> 18:51.000
You flaming brute!

18:52.000 --> 18:55.200
l'll teach you to do that to me!

18:55.300 --> 18:58.200
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.100
l'm afraid it's my fault.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.400
Bad enough not being able
to manage a broom.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.600
l can't perform
a simple, basic spell.

19:05.700 --> 19:09.500
You dared her to do it.
l don't see why we can't all be friends.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.000
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.000
Of course l'm not!

19:14.100 --> 19:17.200
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.

19:17.300 --> 19:21.000
You see, the work l'm doing
is so important to the war effort.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.500
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.300
Most secret.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.500
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.900
Yeah. lf someone
made it worth our while.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.100
l don't follow.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.900
Simple. You give us something
valuable to seal the pact.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.600
Oh, Charlie,
don't try to be clever again.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.600
lt's for our own protection,
ain't it?

19:43.700 --> 19:47.700
lf we broke the pact, we'd have
to give back the valuable object.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.800
l think it's an excellent idea.

19:50.900 --> 19:55.700
l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.900
Bet that's not worth much.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.700
Come with me.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.900
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.700
Well, l never had a rabbit.

20:11.700 --> 20:14.000
Careful what you touch in here.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.200
Rum sort of place, ain't it?

20:19.500 --> 20:22.700
When l signed for my witchcraft
course there was a free bonus,

20:22.900 --> 20:26.600
a marvellous travelling spell
if you paid in advance.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.800
l think l'll give you that one.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.300
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.100
Poisoned dragon's liver?

20:39.000 --> 20:42.600
You mean you poison the dragon
or just the liver?

20:42.700 --> 20:45.900
lt comes prepared.
lt's part of the school equipment.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.600
Here we are. The travelling spell.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.600
Everybody gather round.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.500
All right now. Let's see.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.200
Does any one of you have
a bracelet or a ring?

20:57.300 --> 21:00.100
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.700
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.

21:03.800 --> 21:08.200
Never know when they might come
in useful. Piece of blue glass.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.000
Lovely bit of string.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.000
Horseshoe nail.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.000
What's that?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.500
Knob from the bed upstairs.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.600
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.900
Yes, l think that will be all right.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.200
Carrie, turn the light down
a little bit, will you?

21:39.400 --> 21:42.100
Hellebore, henbane, aconite...

21:45.200 --> 21:48.700
glow-worm fire, firefly light!

21:51.600 --> 21:53.900
There. lsn't that pretty?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
ls that all we get?

21:56.100 --> 21:59.200
This knob will now work
the famous travelling spell.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.900
And what's
the famous travelling spell?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.400
- How does it work?
- You take this knob

22:04.500 --> 22:06.400
and put it back on the bed upstairs.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.900
Then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left

22:09.000 --> 22:12.100
then in a firm, clear voice,
tell it where you want to go

22:12.200 --> 22:14.300
and the bed will take you there.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.300
Go on!

22:15.500 --> 22:19.100
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.700
Thank you for the lovely gift.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.600
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the
only one who can work the spell.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.000
- Me?
- Yes.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.100
That's right. My knob, weren't it?

22:32.200 --> 22:33.800
That's the way the spell works.

22:33.900 --> 22:36.600
Nice mess he'll make of things.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.400
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.200
Don't try anything with the bedknob
till l get back.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.800
''Dear Madam,
it grieves me to inform you

22:47.900 --> 22:51.900
that we have been forced to close
down our College of Witchcraft.''

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
''This means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson

22:55.100 --> 22:57.400
in which you expressed
so much interest.''

23:00.500 --> 23:04.000
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.200
ls there anything we can do?

23:06.300 --> 23:08.300
No. No, thank you.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.800
Yes.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.500
Yes, there is something
that Paul can do.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.700
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.

23:15.800 --> 23:20.400
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.600
Come with me, Paul.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.300
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem

23:29.400 --> 23:31.700
to have to explain this
to a six-year-old,

23:31.800 --> 23:35.100
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.700
l was expecting
a very important spell in the mail

23:37.800 --> 23:41.100
from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.400
What's that got to do with my knob?

23:43.500 --> 23:46.500
l must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

23:46.600 --> 23:51.800
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.800
That is why l need the knob.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.900
What is your decision?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.300
Thank you, Paul.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.100
l brought this for your hair.
lt may be windy.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.100
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.

24:11.300 --> 24:14.000
Paul, have you been
to the bathroom?

24:14.100 --> 24:15.900
- Twice.
- Good.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.200
Charles, put on something warmer.

24:18.300 --> 24:20.300
The bed may travel quite fast.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.400
l'm not going.
l'm staying right here.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.300
But why?

24:25.400 --> 24:30.200
All that rubbish about a travelling bed.
lt won't work. That's why.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.000
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

24:33.100 --> 24:36.200
We don't want to scratch the wall
when we take off.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.600
How's a ruddy big bed like that
gonna get out of this room

24:39.700 --> 24:42.900
with those little windows?

24:43.000 --> 24:46.500
l don't know. There's a great many
things about magic that l don't know.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.100
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!

24:49.200 --> 24:51.000
Just leave me out of it.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.100
l don't fancy
making a fool of myself.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.400
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.500
Help me tidy up. We don't want
to go to London with an unmade bed.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.200
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve.

25:04.300 --> 25:09.400
l see. That's what my father used
to call the age of not believing.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.300
What's that supposed to be?

25:12.400 --> 25:15.900
<i>When you rush around</i>
<i>in hopeless circles</i>

25:16.000 --> 25:20.300
<i>Searching everywhere</i>
<i>for something true</i>

25:20.400 --> 25:24.500
<i>You're at the age of not believing</i>

25:24.500 --> 25:27.600
<i>When all the make-believe</i>
<i>is through</i>

25:27.700 --> 25:29.900
That's Charlie to a tee.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.500
<i>When you set aside</i>
<i>your childhood heroes</i>

25:33.600 --> 25:37.800
<i>And your dreams are lost</i>
<i>upon a shelf</i>

25:37.900 --> 25:42.300
<i>You're at the age of not believing</i>

25:42.400 --> 25:46.700
<i>And worst of all you doubt yourself</i>

25:46.800 --> 25:48.300
Throw that away.

25:48.400 --> 25:52.700
<i>You're a castaway</i>
<i>where no one hears you</i>

25:52.800 --> 25:56.500
<i>On a barren isle in a lonely sea</i>

25:56.600 --> 25:58.100
What's that? Poetry?

25:58.200 --> 26:01.300
<i>Where did all the happy endings go?</i>

26:01.400 --> 26:05.500
<i>Where can all the good times be?</i>

26:05.700 --> 26:07.700
Everyone on the bed who's going.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.500
<i>You must face the age</i>
<i>of not believing</i>

26:11.600 --> 26:15.400
<i>Doubting everything you ever knew</i>

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
The knob.

26:16.600 --> 26:21.000
<i>Until at last you start believing</i>

26:21.100 --> 26:26.200
<i>There's something wonderful in you</i>

26:27.200 --> 26:29.000
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.400
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.800
Repeat after me.

26:33.700 --> 26:38.000
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
Very good.

26:45.200 --> 26:49.800
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.700
<i>..</i> of Witchcraft, London.

27:00.300 --> 27:04.000
When l say go,
tap the knob three times

27:04.100 --> 27:06.800
and turn it a quarter turn
to the left.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.800
- Left...
- That's it.

27:10.900 --> 27:14.000
We'd better hold on tight.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.700
The behaviour of the bed
is something l'm not sure of.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.400
Let me breathe a little.

27:19.500 --> 27:23.200
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.400
One... two... three...

28:22.500 --> 28:24.200
- ls this London?
- Course it is!

28:24.300 --> 28:27.800
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?

28:27.900 --> 28:30.600
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.000
l don't see no Professor Browne.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.600
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed

28:35.700 --> 28:37.800
while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.

28:40.100 --> 28:44.200
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again.

28:44.300 --> 28:49.100
lt didn't work. lt was supposed
to take us to Professor Browne.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.800
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!

29:03.400 --> 29:07.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather round, please.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.400
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.700
l am here to divert, to amuse,

29:15.800 --> 29:17.900
and, yes, even to help you.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.200
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are...

29:23.700 --> 29:25.600
lt is what they seem to be.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.500
ls that not so?

29:27.100 --> 29:29.300
That ain't the kind
of professor l expected.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.800
l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.700
What effect a little smoke is...

29:37.200 --> 29:39.000
with a dash of hocus-pocus

29:39.100 --> 29:41.000
and the scent of burning...

29:42.600 --> 29:45.100
and the scent
of burning sulphur in the air.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.300
And now, for my next trick,
may l draw your attention

29:49.400 --> 29:52.000
to this solid piece
of ordinary window glass,

29:52.100 --> 29:55.100
framed in an ordinary
unprepared frame.

29:55.300 --> 29:59.400
May l also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.500
Now l shall place the framed glass

30:01.600 --> 30:03.500
in this brown, unprepared...

30:03.600 --> 30:05.600
Unprepared, mark you...

30:05.700 --> 30:08.100
Unprepared brown paper bag.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.500
l shall now attempt to drive
the steel nail through the glass

30:12.600 --> 30:15.000
without breaking the glass.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.100
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.700
We shall see.

30:22.900 --> 30:25.600
He ain't very good,
even if he is a professor.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.300
l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.400
Don't leave now
and regret lost opportunities later.

30:40.200 --> 30:44.700
You, young sir. Would you care
to warble like the storied nightingale?

30:44.800 --> 30:47.100
With this inexpensive device,

30:47.200 --> 30:50.600
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees, like so.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.400
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.500
One copper coin of the realm.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.200
Carrie, l'm very surprised
at you wandering off like this.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.600
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.300
Don't work. l've been cheated!

31:17.400 --> 31:20.500
ls that Professor Browne?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.800
lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?

31:22.900 --> 31:29.000
Would you be interested in the mating
call of the Brazilian bird of love?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.100
Very useful, eh?

31:31.200 --> 31:35.100
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?

31:35.200 --> 31:38.500
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.000
Professor Browne,
l am one of your pupils.

31:41.100 --> 31:45.500
My dear lady, you are indeed
an ornament to the college.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.300
- Splendid.
- Not at all.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.000
l was shocked when you
closed down the college

31:50.200 --> 31:53.000
without that most important
last lesson.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.000
l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.

31:56.100 --> 31:59.300
But l must have the spell
that comes with the last lesson!

31:59.400 --> 32:01.500
The matter is closed.
l bid you good day.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.800
l have an appointment at my club.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.800
The matter is not closed!

32:05.900 --> 32:08.600
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!

32:16.300 --> 32:18.600
Here we are.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.900
Will you get this child off my leg?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.400
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.100
Now l trust you'll behave
more like a gentleman.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.600
Look out!

32:36.600 --> 32:38.600
There goes another rabbit.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.200
What was all that about?

32:40.300 --> 32:43.100
l changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.900
My spell? From my school?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Not one of your best spells.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.200
lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.

32:52.300 --> 32:55.200
But l don't understand. My spell?

32:55.300 --> 32:57.600
They were just nonsense words
from an old book.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.600
They worked perfectly well for me.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.100
They work for you?

33:06.700 --> 33:10.200
Good woman! Some kind of destiny
has brought us together.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.900
You got these spells
out of some old book, you say?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.200
l changed them round a bit.

33:15.300 --> 33:18.600
l gave them a bit
of my own style, as it were.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.900
The old sorcerers did have
a bit of a tendency to waffle on.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
But dear lady, l never thought
l'd meet somebody like you.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.800
What a treasure.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.000
Mr Browne, will you please
stick to the point.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.600
l would like to see this book
immediately.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.100
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.500
Would you care
to join me for luncheon?

33:39.600 --> 33:42.500
We can discuss my ideas
at the same time.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.600
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.800
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.

33:53.300 --> 33:56.200
You go round the other side.
l always travel on the left.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.500
Will you give the address
to Paul, please?

34:00.600 --> 34:03.800
May l ask how we are going
to get there on this bed? Fly?

34:03.900 --> 34:06.500
My dear Professor,
with your own travelling spell.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.199
The one you gave with the course
as a bonus.

34:09.300 --> 34:12.400
My travelling spell?
That works as well?

34:12.500 --> 34:14.600
Just give the address, please.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.600
8 Winchfield Road.

34:17.699 --> 34:21.199
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.000
Madam, is this vehicle safe?

34:32.100 --> 34:37.600
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps,
but then most good spells are.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.700
We're here.
l would never have believed it.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.900
You must have given us
the wrong address. Do you live here?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.600
ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.500
l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.000
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.400
Why should they do that?

35:30.100 --> 35:33.000
This probably has
something to do with it.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.500
Merciful heavens!

35:36.600 --> 35:39.300
You should be terrified
at the very idea of living here.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.800
You would have thought so.
l am by nature a little bit of a coward.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.500
But then l pondered.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.100
ln the perverse nature of things,
this diabolical object

35:48.200 --> 35:50.300
is probably the best friend
l've ever had.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.600
lt enables me, for the first time
in my life, to live like a king.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.600
Shall we go in?

35:57.900 --> 36:01.200
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise,

36:01.300 --> 36:03.700
but with a charming
touch of innocence.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.900
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.900
Dear lady, you are relentless.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.100
The book is in the library. We shall
proceed there after our cheese and wine.

36:12.900 --> 36:15.200
Why do you keep the curtains closed?

36:15.300 --> 36:18.400
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candle light.

36:18.500 --> 36:22.200
More likely so's a copper don't peek in
and catch you hiding out here.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.800
Why don't you
have a look round the house?

36:24.900 --> 36:27.100
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?

36:27.200 --> 36:29.700
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.700
Remember, this house
does not belong to Mr Browne.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.200
Mr Browne, where is that book?

36:35.300 --> 36:38.000
l must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.600
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.

36:52.700 --> 36:56.600
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.100
Would you hold this, please?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.900
What do you think of that?

37:56.500 --> 37:59.100
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.

37:59.100 --> 38:03.800
Think how successful l could be with
an assistant who can really do magic.

38:04.700 --> 38:09.600
Dear lady, have you ever considered
entering show business?

38:09.700 --> 38:11.600
- The what business?
- The theatre!

38:11.700 --> 38:13.900
Pantomimes, village fairs,
the seaside.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.800
Brighton, Blackpool,
follies on the prom.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.600
l have very important work to do.

38:18.700 --> 38:21.400
Listen to me. We could make a packet.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.600
<i>Let us strike a bargain</i>

38:23.700 --> 38:25.100
<i>You possess a gift</i>

38:25.200 --> 38:27.100
<i>But I can speak the jargon</i>

38:27.200 --> 38:29.700
<i>That will give your gift</i>
<i>the needed lift</i>

38:29.800 --> 38:31.800
<i>You possess the know-how</i>

38:31.900 --> 38:34.000
<i>And I command the show-how</i>

38:34.100 --> 38:37.900
<i>Oh, how successful you could be</i>

38:38.000 --> 38:39.800
<i>With me</i>

38:39.900 --> 38:42.200
l'm afraid we're wasting
valuable time.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.900
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.800
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.

38:47.500 --> 38:52.500
<i>Eglantine, Eglantine,</i>
<i>oh, how you'll shine</i>

38:52.600 --> 38:56.600
<i>Your lot and my lot</i>
<i>have got to combine</i>

38:56.700 --> 39:00.300
<i>Eglantine, Eglantine,</i>
<i>hark to the stars</i>

39:00.400 --> 39:03.800
<i>Destiny calls us,</i>
<i>the future is ours</i>

39:03.900 --> 39:07.600
<i>As the shine sells the boot</i>
<i>and the blossoms the fruit</i>

39:07.700 --> 39:11.400
<i>All you need to succeed</i>
<i>in your plan</i>

39:11.500 --> 39:15.600
<i>Is the proper ally</i>
<i>upon whom to rely</i>

39:15.700 --> 39:18.700
<i>And I'm your man</i>

39:19.200 --> 39:23.500
<i>For I have an acumen</i>
<i>that's nigh-superhuman</i>

39:23.600 --> 39:26.100
<i>I sell things that nobody can</i>

39:26.900 --> 39:31.000
<i>So I humbly suggest</i>
<i>you accept my behest</i>

39:31.200 --> 39:34.100
<i>I'm your man</i>

39:35.000 --> 39:38.400
<i>Eglantine, Eglantine,</i>
<i>oh how you'll shine</i>

39:38.500 --> 39:39.800
Will you stop?

39:39.900 --> 39:42.300
<i>Your lot and my lot</i>
<i>have got to combine</i>

39:42.400 --> 39:45.700
<i>Eglantine, Eglantine,</i>
<i>hark to the stars</i>

39:45.800 --> 39:48.900
<i>Destiny calls us,</i>
<i>the future is ours</i>

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
What are you reading?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.000
''lsle of Naboombu.''

39:59.100 --> 40:02.800
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.700
These pictures prove it, don't it?

40:06.800 --> 40:10.500
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.500
l like it.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.800
Now where is the book?

40:18.900 --> 40:20.900
Well? Where is it?

40:37.500 --> 40:40.400
At last, Mr Browne!

40:44.100 --> 40:47.300
''The Spells of Astoroth.''

40:47.400 --> 40:49.300
Of course.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.100
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.100
Does one's nose
have to twitch like this?

40:56.700 --> 40:58.700
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.800
Miss Price,
a word about your tactics.

41:00.900 --> 41:03.200
l don't mind being changed
into a hawk or a tiger

41:03.300 --> 41:04.600
or something with dash.

41:04.700 --> 41:08.200
But always a fluffy white rabbit?
lt's intolerable!

41:09.600 --> 41:13.200
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.

41:13.900 --> 41:17.200
''The ancient art of...''

41:17.300 --> 41:22.800
''The spell which creates
this force is five mystic words.''

41:22.900 --> 41:25.400
''These words are...''

41:30.700 --> 41:32.400
But the rest of the book is missing!

41:32.500 --> 41:34.800
Now you see why
l closed down the college.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.600
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.

41:39.700 --> 41:42.400
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.000
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book?

41:46.100 --> 41:50.000
l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.700
He claimed that l'd given him
a dud coin. l ask you!

41:52.800 --> 41:55.200
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.400
He got one half and l got the other.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.900
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.800
But if it still exists,
there's only one place to find it.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.800
- Where is that?
- <i>Portobello Road</i>

42:07.900 --> 42:10.000
<i>Portobello Road</i>

42:10.100 --> 42:13.500
<i>Street where</i>
<i>the riches of ages are stowed</i>

<i>Is sold off the barrow</i>
<i>in Portobello Road</i>

42:20.100 --> 42:25.000
<i>You'll find what you want</i>
<i>in the Portobello Road</i>

- <i>Genuine plaster</i>

<i>A filigreed samovar</i>
<i>owned by the tsars</i>

- <i>A pen used by Shelley</i>
- <i>A new Botticelli!</i>

42:37.200 --> 42:40.800
<i>The snippers that clipped</i>
<i>old King Edward's cigars</i>

42:40.900 --> 42:44.400
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?

42:44.500 --> 42:47.500
- <i>Waterford crystal</i>
- <i>Napoleon's pistols</i>

42:47.600 --> 42:51.000
<i>Society heirlooms with genuine gems</i>

42:51.100 --> 42:54.600
<i>Rembrandts, El Grecos,</i>
<i>Toulouse-Lautrecos</i>

42:54.700 --> 42:58.000
<i>Painted last week</i>
<i>on the banks of the Thames</i>

42:59.000 --> 43:01.700
Very interesting,
but where do they sell books?

43:01.800 --> 43:03.900
There's a little place
around the corner.

43:04.700 --> 43:08.000
<i>Portobello Road, Portobello Road</i>

43:08.100 --> 43:11.400
<i>Street where</i>
<i>the riches of ages are stowed</i>

<i>Anything and everything</i>

<i>Is sold off the barrow</i>

43:17.800 --> 43:22.400
<i>You meet all your chums</i>
<i>in the Portobello Road</i>

43:22.600 --> 43:24.600
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

43:27.900 --> 43:30.500
What l want
is the other half of this book.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.500
All in good time, my dear.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.800
<i>Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,</i>
<i>The Fishmonger's Guidebook</i>

43:35.900 --> 43:37.800
l'm looking for
the other part of this.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.600
<i>A Victorian novel, ''The Unwanted Son''</i>

<i>yesterday's pleasures</i>

<i>Cheap imitations</i>

This lady is looking
for the other half of this book.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.100
lt's called ''The Spells of Astoroth''.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.800
l don't keep no torn
or damaged books here.

What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?

44:31.300 --> 44:35.200
<i>You can eat like a king</i>
<i>in the Portobello Road</i>

44:37.100 --> 44:39.800
There's another bookstore
along here somewhere.

44:39.900 --> 44:42.600
You don't expect
to sell a piano like that, do you?

44:42.700 --> 44:45.000
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.

44:46.400 --> 44:50.400
<i>Portobello Road, Portobello Road</i>

Come on, ducks!

47:31.400 --> 47:33.000
Come on, girls!

47:43.600 --> 47:45.500
Lovely.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.700
Oh, yeah, play the drums.

49:39.900 --> 49:41.500

50:21.100 --> 50:24.500
Hey, governor. Something
for the lady friend? Nylons?

50:24.600 --> 50:26.400
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?

50:26.500 --> 50:28.400
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.

50:28.500 --> 50:31.300
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.

50:31.400 --> 50:34.800
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?

50:36.400 --> 50:39.100
Now you have my undivided attention.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.200
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.

50:42.300 --> 50:44.900
He wants to see you. You too.

50:45.700 --> 50:48.900
Who is the Bookman? And what right
has he got to order me about?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.500
l think we'd better
ask questions later.

50:51.600 --> 50:53.200
Excuse me.

50:57.300 --> 51:00.500
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.

51:00.700 --> 51:03.100
Why didn't you
bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne,

51:03.200 --> 51:05.200
and half the Household Cavalry
as well?

51:05.300 --> 51:07.200
What's the bed for?

51:07.300 --> 51:10.300
lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.800
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.

51:12.900 --> 51:14.900
Except for this knob, which is mine.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.800
Bookman, there's been bad blood
between us long enough.

51:18.900 --> 51:22.000
Let this gift begin friendship anew.

51:22.100 --> 51:25.400
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.800
lsn't that the section of the manuscript
we've been looking for?

51:28.900 --> 51:31.900
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.200
A charming young woman
of my acquaintance.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.400
Miss Price, l've been looking
for this other bit a long time.

51:37.500 --> 51:40.700
Mr Swinburne told me you were
in the market making enquiries.

51:40.800 --> 51:45.500
And here we are. l don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last...

51:45.500 --> 51:49.200
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.

51:49.300 --> 51:53.200
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne.

51:53.300 --> 51:55.600
ls that clear?

51:55.700 --> 52:00.400
lt's all like a jolly detective story
or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?

52:00.500 --> 52:03.700
We're both after the same spell.

52:03.800 --> 52:06.600
You have one clue, l have the other.

52:07.100 --> 52:12.700
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate.

52:13.500 --> 52:16.800
l assume you're looking
for the same thing l am.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.100
May l?

52:19.900 --> 52:22.800
This is quite a moment
for both of us.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.300
''Substitutiary locomotion,

52:27.400 --> 52:31.500
the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.900
Here we are.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.200
''The spell which creates this force
is five mystic words.''

52:37.300 --> 52:39.000
''These words are...

52:39.100 --> 52:44.900
engraved on the star that was always
worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''

52:45.000 --> 52:47.200
But where are the words of the spell?

52:47.300 --> 52:50.300
l assumed they'd be
in your half of the manuscript.

52:50.400 --> 52:53.000
l thought they'd be in yours!

52:53.100 --> 52:56.500
Once again, a dead end.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.900
l shall never know the secret.

53:01.800 --> 53:05.800
lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.

53:05.900 --> 53:08.200
Pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

53:08.300 --> 53:11.200
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,

53:11.300 --> 53:13.300
Astoroth kept animals in cages

53:13.400 --> 53:16.500
in search for the spells that
would make them more like humans.

53:16.600 --> 53:20.900
The legend is that finally the
animals rebelled at the experiment,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.900
killed Astoroth
and stole many of his powers.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.600
lncluding the star
with the spell on it.

53:27.600 --> 53:31.000
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away

53:31.100 --> 53:33.100
and were never heard of again.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.900
However, there is a final notation
in my half of the book

53:37.000 --> 53:39.300
saying that in the 1 7th century

53:39.400 --> 53:42.300
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea

53:42.400 --> 53:46.000
half mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.300
Before he died, he swore he had seen
an island ruled by animals.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.600
Where?

53:52.700 --> 53:57.600
There is,
l regret to say, no such island.

53:57.700 --> 54:00.000
l looked for it in every chart.

54:00.100 --> 54:03.500
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.200
lt does too! Got my own...

54:07.300 --> 54:09.600
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!

54:09.700 --> 54:12.500
When he don't say nothing,
he mumbles.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.100
l wish the child to speak!

54:16.100 --> 54:19.900
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?

54:26.700 --> 54:29.400
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.300
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.800
- Give it to me.
- No.

54:33.900 --> 54:37.000
Please don't annoy me.

54:37.100 --> 54:40.300
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.

54:41.300 --> 54:44.000
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it?

54:48.100 --> 54:50.600
lf it's all the same to you,
l'd rather use my own.

54:50.800 --> 54:53.400
Sentiment, you know.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.500
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.

54:55.600 --> 54:59.400
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.

54:59.500 --> 55:02.700
Observe the fundamental weakness
of the criminal mind.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.800
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.600
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.

55:08.700 --> 55:12.000
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.900
He's up to something, you know.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.300
Before your very eyes, l shall cause
this bed and the occupants on it

55:19.400 --> 55:21.400
to disappear.

55:21.500 --> 55:25.100
l should like to see a cheap-jack
tenth-rate entertainer

55:25.200 --> 55:26.900
do a trick like that.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.600
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''

55:28.700 --> 55:31.100
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.

55:31.900 --> 55:33.700
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.

55:33.800 --> 55:37.000
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.700
Bed, take us
to the lsland of Naboombu.

55:45.200 --> 55:47.600
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!

56:23.100 --> 56:25.500
Beastly climate.
l never did fancy the sea.

56:25.900 --> 56:29.000
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course.

56:29.100 --> 56:31.800
l've never seen
no island like this before.

56:31.900 --> 56:35.000
l'm afraid we may have
fallen into the lagoon.

56:35.100 --> 56:38.400
That's right.
Here we are on page three.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.700
Oi, Mr Codfish!

56:47.800 --> 56:52.100
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.000
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.

56:56.600 --> 56:58.600
Not too bright, is he?

56:58.700 --> 57:02.300
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.500
Mr Codfish,
where is the lsland of Naboombu?

57:05.600 --> 57:08.700
You mean the land part? Oh, that.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.500
Straight up. You can't miss it.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.800
None of my business, of course,

57:13.900 --> 57:17.200
but l shouldn't go there
if l were you.

57:17.300 --> 57:21.100
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?

57:21.200 --> 57:24.200
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.

57:24.300 --> 57:26.700
Trouble or not,
we should be getting along.

57:26.800 --> 57:29.500
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush?

57:29.600 --> 57:32.700
lt's really rather splendid
down here. For you, my dear.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.200
Thank you.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.700
How pleasant...

57:43.800 --> 57:45.200
<i>Bobbing along</i>

57:45.300 --> 57:51.300
<i>Bobbing along on the bottom</i>
<i>of the beautiful briny sea</i>

57:51.900 --> 57:55.700
<i>What a chance to get a better peep</i>

57:55.800 --> 57:59.600
<i>At the plants and creatures</i>

57:59.700 --> 58:02.800

58:25.300 --> 58:29.400
<i>What if the octopus,</i>
<i>the flounder and the cod</i>

58:29.500 --> 58:30.900
<i>Think we're rather odd?</i>

58:31.000 --> 58:33.400
<i>It's fun to promenade</i>

58:33.500 --> 58:35.800
<i>Bobbing along, singing a song</i>

58:35.900 --> 58:41.400

Look!

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.700
<i>It's lovely bobbing along</i>

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:23.600

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.300
<i>It's grand</i>

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.500
<i>When you're dancing on the sand</i>

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.800
<i>Each glance</i>

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.900
<i>Bubbles over with romance</i>

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.900

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.900
Bravo!

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.200
Most exciting, most exciting.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.700
You've won the ruddy cup.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.900
Help!

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.000
This time l really caught a whopper!

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:28.400
People! Oh, no!

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.400
What scurvy luck.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.200
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.100
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.500
l used to be a bit
of a seafaring man myself.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.000
Many's the time
l've shipped out of Portsmouth.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.500
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.900
Now stow it, mate.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.700
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading?

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.700
lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.400
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.300
That means l've got to throw you
all back. That's what to do.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.700
Wait it minute! lt says here
that anybody can see the king.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.100
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.000
Here in my book.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.300
So it do.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.900
But if you people knew
what was good for you,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.400
you'd get yourselves
all throwed back.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.300
The king don't like people!

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.700
Nonetheless, we must see the king
on an urgent personal matter.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.500
Please lead the way.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.600
But just don't say
l didn't warn you. See?

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.900
Follow me.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.900
Get out of here!

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.400
Yes. What can l do for you?

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.800
l caught some people
down at the sea lagoon.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.300
They want to see the king.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.700
Really? Well, we can't be bothered
with that sort of thing now, can we?

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.000
l don't know that l fancy this.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.700
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.200
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer,

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.800
l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.900
No, no. You don't understand.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.900
As everyone knows,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.700
His Majesty is
the world's greatest soccer player.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.900
But due to a technical problem,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.200
the Royal Cup match
cannot take place today.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.000
And His Majesty
had so set his heart on it!

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:18.300
Throw these... creatures
back into the sea.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.900
Aye, aye, sir.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.300
Just a moment! l can help!

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.900
Do you really think so?
l'd be most grateful.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.600
Do you know soccer?

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.800
Do l know anything about soccer?

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.800
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.100
Three seasons
with Manchester United...

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.900
Yes, yes. You'll do.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.500
Come this way, please.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.000
Mr Browne,
are you certain you'll be all right?

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.100
Now what?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.400
Not an ideal person
in many respects,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.300
but Mr Browne is a very brave man.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.500
Do you think he's done for?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.200
Do you think so?

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:19.800
l can't tell you how
l appreciate this.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.600
For some reason
we have great difficulty

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.600
finding referees round here.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.900
lf there be one thing we like,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.300
it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.500
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.200
What's he got round his neck?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.400
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.300
Ah, yes.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.300
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.900
The Star of Astoroth!

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.700
You're to sit
in His Majesty's royal box.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.300
No littering, no chewing, no fruit
or wrappers or sweets. Please.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.700
Rise, please.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.700
Loyal fans,

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.900
this is official.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.200
We have a volunteer referee.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.100
Let the match begin!

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.600
He's still wearing it!

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.200
Right, Dirty Yellows,
let's have a clean game.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.400
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.

01:08:34.899 --> 01:08:37.000
Weird sort of game they play here.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.200
Hurry up! Get rid of it!

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:40.800
Gracious!

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.399
You're doing fine, matey.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.800
Move it around.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.300
Get on with the match!

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.700
- Foul!
- They're only animals.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.400
That's no excuse for dirty football.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.100
Ref, are you blind?

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.300
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.700
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.700
The king makes them up
as he goes along.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.100
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.900
Well, he's moving.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.500
Steady, matey. Move it around.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.200
He almost had it then.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.700
Looks like he's done for this time.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.800
Don't just stand there! Head it in!

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:40.100
Stop... that... ball!

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.800
Goal!

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.000
Game's over. l win.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:28.200
Let me give you a hand, matey.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.200
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.100
Please, let me help you
on with your robe.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.500
Why, yes. Thank you.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.100
Can't have you
catching cold, sire, can we?

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.800
Why, no.

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.800
Have you ever heard of something
called the gypsy switch?

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.000
No, can't say that l have.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.100
Remind me to
tell you about it some time.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.500
l can't tell you when
we've had such a good time.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.100
We'll carry your memory
in our hearts for a long while.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.400
l think it's time to leave.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.300
Must you go?

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.500
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.500
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.700
Friendly lot.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:14.900
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.100
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.600
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.300
Your Royal Star!

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.300
They've stolen your Royal Star!

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.700
Don't be ridiculous.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.900
What do you think this is?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.200
Why didn't you say so?

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.700
Paul, put the knob on the bed.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:06.400
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.800
l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.900
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.600
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400
Got it.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.100
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.500
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.200
l shall never get used to this thing.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.900
Will you push the bed
back into place, please?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.600
l think we could all
do with a nice cup of tea.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.400
No time. l've gone to a lot
of trouble to find this spell.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.900
l'm going to try it immediately.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.100
Mr Browne, kindly let me
have your shoes, please.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.800
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for?

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.900
lf you'd been paying attention
l should think you'd be aware

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.100
that substitutiary locomotion is the art
of causing inanimate objects

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.300
to take on a life force of their own.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.200
l must have inanimate objects
to experiment with.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.000
Makes sense, don't it?

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.100
Stand back, everyone.
l need plenty of room.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.700
l want you all
to be absolutely quiet.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.400
Mr Browne, you have
the Star of Astoroth, l believe.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.800
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.200
lt's all right, Mr Browne.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.900
l should have realised
that it would be impossible

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.300
to take an object
from one world into another.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.600
lf only l would have had the sense
to remember the words on that star.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:22.900
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.700
Why don't you and l nip out
and get something for supper?

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.000
And l might conceivably
call into the pub for a pint

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100
to steady my nerves.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.200
l do know the words, Miss Price.

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.300
How can you know the words
when Miss Price doesn't?

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.500
<i>Troop movements and massing</i>
<i>of barges in French and Dutch ports.</i>

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.700
<i>The prime minister</i>
<i>has told the nation</i>

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.600
<i>to be on the alert for signs</i>
<i>of a possible invasion.</i>

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.400
<i>That was the news.</i>

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.000
l might have been able
to do something about this.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.900
lt's out of your hands now, my dear.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.800
lf only l could have remembered
those words. lt's maddening.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.400
Why don't someone ask me?

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.000
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember
those kind of words.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:11.800
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides
trecorum satis dee''?

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.700
- How do you know that?
- Easy.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.200
Says so right here in my book.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.100
You mean it was there
in your book all the time?

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.400
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.700
Treguna mekoides

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.100
trecorum satis dee.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.700
Nothing happened!

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.500
Am l doing something wrong?

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.900
Well, it does seem
a bit old-fashioned.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.500
After all, we are
in the 20th century.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.100
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.100
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.600
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:02.400
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.800
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:14.300
<i>Substitutiary locomotion</i>

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.700
<i>Mystic power that's far</i>
<i>beyond the wildest notion</i>

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.400
<i>It's so weird, so feared,</i>
<i>yet wonderful to see</i>

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.100
<i>Substitutiary locomotion come to me</i>

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.200
Now!

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.600
Treguna mekoides

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:39.900
trecorum satis dee.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.300
<i>I don't want locomotiary substitution</i>

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.200
<i>Or remote intransecory convolution</i>

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:02.500
<i>Only one precise solution is the key</i>

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.400
<i>Substitutiary locomotion it must be</i>

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.700
<i>Substitutiary locomotion</i>

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.900
<i>Lovely substitutiary locomotion</i>

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:44.100
<i>You've made substitutiary history</i>

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:48.300
<i>With treguna mekoides</i>
<i>and a little help from me</i>

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.700
- <i>With treguna mekoides and...</i>
- <i>Trecorum satis dee</i>

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.600
Mr Browne, what is going on here?

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.800
l haven't the foggiest.

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.200
How do you do?

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.500
Shall we?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.300
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear?

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.500
l'm not responsible
for its behaviour.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.800
Obviously not, my dear.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.100
Paul, what on earth are you doing?

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.500
Having a jolly good time,
that's what.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.100
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.400
But we must do something.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.900
Didn't l give you
my all-purpose cut-off spell?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.700
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.900
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.400
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.500
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.000
Mr Browne, will you please
control your shoes?

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.500
Dear lady, l very much fear
that we have nothing under control.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.200
Do you mind?

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.200
Now, who would like some more
of my lovely sausages and mash?

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.600
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie?

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.100
l've already had two helpings.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.300
- l'm full.
- Me, too.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.000
At least somebody wants some.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.400
Cheer up, my dear. This should
be something of a celebration.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:22.100
l'm sorry, but there doesn't
seem to be much to celebrate.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.100
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.300
You just need a little more practice.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.600
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.100
Meantime, there's nothing
to liven the spirits

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.600
like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.100
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:50.200
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.800
and a touch of genius.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.500
Never happened to me before.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.900
l don't usually juggle
with cats under my feet.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.200
Look! She's laughing!

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.400
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.300
l've just come by
to bring you the good news.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.400
Mr Bistlethwaite,
who brings the milk, you know?

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.500
He's promised
to take the children in!

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:44.400
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.000
Put a bit of colour
back in their cheeks.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.300
Why, what's the matter?
l thought you'd be pleased.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.200
You told me yourself that you had
no time to take care of children.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.900
Circumstances have changed somewhat.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:05.900
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.400
Of course. You do want him to stay
with us, don't you, Miss Price?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.500
l suppose
l hadn't really thought about it.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.100
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne?

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.900
lt's all rather sudden!
l don't quite know what to say.

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.900
Then l'll leave you two
to talk it over.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
l'll come back in the morning!
Good night!

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.400
lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going
to be our father now, aren't you?

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.200
We are rather rushing things,
aren't we?

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:52.600
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things
besides you children to think about.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.500
Yes. As a matter of fact
l should have left ages ago.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.500
l must get a train
back to London tonight.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.100
lt's rather an important matter.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.900
l'd like to tell you about it,
but it's a little bit hush-hush.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.500
Sort of a secret.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.600
Well... if...

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:19.100
lf l've been any sort of help to you,
l'm pleased.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.000
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.400
l've enjoyed being with you.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.600
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.600
Will you be coming back?

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:33.100
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope
that we shall meet again.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.600
Some day.
When all this war business is over.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.200
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.900
Eglantine and Emelius:
illusionists extraordinary!

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.300
Just think how that
will look on the poster.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.600
The children are going to miss you.

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.100
- You really think they will?
- Yes.

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.800
Well, l shall miss you. All of you.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.800
lf l don't go now
you might never get rid of me.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.400
Goodbye, Carrie.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.800
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.300
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.400
Goodbye, Charlie.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.000
Do you want me to come down
to the station with you?

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:27.000
No, no. You stay here
and look after everybody.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:33.100
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.900
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.400
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.600
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.800
Good night.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.600
Out you go, Cosmic.

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.300
Hello?

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.900
<i>Emelius Browne, do you know</i>
<i>you could be warm and cosy</i>

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.200
<i>in that house at this very moment?</i>

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.500
<i>For once in your useless life,</i>
<i>you really seem to have been needed.</i>

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.500
<i>You're a failure, Emelius Browne,</i>

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.400
<i>and a coward.</i>

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.400
No, <i>Fräulein,</i> this is not
the invasion, just a little exercise.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.600
A minor raid to induce panic
and to spread a little mischief.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.800
When you English get it
through your head

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.200
that the German forces can land
whenever and wherever we please,

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.600
perhaps you will consider
reasonable peace.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.200
Not bloody likely!

01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.700
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.600
l must say, it's very tempting.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:04.900
Colonel, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.700
l said, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.900
Be quiet, please.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.200
Filigree, apogee, epogee...

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:24.400
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:29.400
Would you kindly fetch my notebook
from the workroom?

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.600
Righto.

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:37.500
Silence!

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.900
We have work to do.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.600
l am sorry, but l must send
all of you some place

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.900
where you will no longer
be a nuisance.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.300
<i>As the words sell the tune</i>

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.800
<i>And the moonbeams the moon</i>

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:05.300
<i>All I need to succeed in my plan</i>

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.800
<i>Is a champion rare</i>
<i>with a flourish and a flair</i>

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.300
Eglantine!

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.300
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.800
Confound it, can't women ever learn
to file things properly?

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.600
Here it is.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:33.300
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400
Filigree...

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.700
apogee, pedigree, perigee.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.500
Come along. For once in your life,
you've got to believe in something.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.100
That's it. Good lad.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:02.700
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:34.900
What's the use of putting us
in that draughty castle?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.600
lt's quite chilly.

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.700
The colonel believes when a British
female decides to become a nuisance,

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.300
she can become
the greatest nuisance in the world,

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.900
and l'm inclined to agree with him.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.100
You need a lesson in manners.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.600
lf l had my notebook,
l'd make certain you'd learn a few.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.700
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.300
Take it easy, can't you?

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.700
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.400
We could strip him down
and grease him with soap.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:31.900
No, it's no good. We can't do it.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.700
l could have told you that
in the first place.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.200
lf we can't get Paul out we'll just
have to think of something else.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.900
What about that spell
that makes things move about?

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.400
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things?

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.500
l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.100
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!

01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:59.800
He's on his way to London.

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:01.300
Mr Browne?

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.800
lf you are Mr Browne,
would you get off my lap?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.800
lt is Mr Browne!

01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:14.600
lt is you!

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:17.300
You didn't think
that l could do that spell, did you?

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.000
l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.300
What's wrong with
the substitutiary locomotion spell?

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:27.100
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.700
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:33.400
We can't let these so-and-sos
get away with their beastly little raid.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.500
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.700
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.000
Let's hope you haven't
forgotten the spell.

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.300
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.400
Probably not magic,
but it might make you feel more at home.

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.000
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.400
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.900
Treguna...

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:22.000
mekoides...

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.800
trecorum...

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.400
satis dee.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.500
Look!

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:41.100
Sound the advance!

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.200
Just in time for the kick-off.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.200
Steady on the left.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.500
Victory for England and St George!

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.800
Like a Lord Mayor's show!

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:31.800
Pikemen, hold your distance.

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:35.300
<i>Treguna mekoides</i>

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.700
<i>and trecorum satis dee</i>

01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.500
Blimey!

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.400
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.900
Come on, lads! After me.

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.900
Good shooting, bowmen!

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.900
Well caught, sir. Very good.

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.900
Knock his block off! That's it!

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.200
Mr Browne,
make those children take cover!

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.600
Are you still there, Colonel?
l thought you'd be on your way by now.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:02.100
You see? Things may not
be so easy for you after all.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.500
Goodbye, Colonel!

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.600
Eglantine.

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.200
Dear Mr Browne.

01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:10.400
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.100
There they are, lads!
l said something was afoot!

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.600
All right. Drive them into the sea.

01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.000
Firing positions. Both sides.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.600
All right, men. Hold your fire.

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.300
l think we've taught
the Hun a lesson.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.500
He'll think twice
before coming back here again.

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:44.500
lt's tragic. All your spells,
your equipment. All gone.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:48.200
Still, l was able to perform
some small service first.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.400
That mean you ain't gonna
be a witch no more? Never?

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:56.500
No, Paul. l realised some time ago
that l could never be a proper witch.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:00.300
Was it that first magic moment
when you laid eyes on me?

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.700
No. lt was the day
my poisoned dragon's liver arrived.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.200
l knew that anyone who felt the way
l did about poisoned dragon's liver

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.100
had no business being a witch.

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:22.600
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so.

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:25.000
lt's much too dangerous
being a civilian.

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.000
Take care of yourself, guv.

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:30.700
l'll do that. And l'll be back
before you've grown an inch taller.

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.100
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.100
Well, here we go.

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:03.500
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:08.000
Parade, by the right,

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.200
quick march!

01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:25.900
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.100
Still got this, ain't l?
