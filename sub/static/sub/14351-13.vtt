WEBVTT

00:03.947 --> 00:07.363
Captain's log, stardate 4372.5.

00:07.534 --> 00:09.158
On a top-secret diplomatic mission,

00:09.327 --> 00:11.653
the Enterprise
has entered the Tellun star system.

00:11.830 --> 00:15.365
Maintaining communications blackout,
we have taken aboard Petri,

00:15.542 --> 00:18.033
ambassador from Troyius,
the outer planet,

00:18.212 --> 00:21.711
and are now approaching
the inner planet, Elas.

00:21.882 --> 00:26.710
Some deskbound Starfleet bureaucrat
cut these cloak-and-dagger orders.

00:26.887 --> 00:28.596
Aye, but why the secrecy?

00:28.764 --> 00:30.923
This star system's
under Federation control.

00:31.100 --> 00:34.932
It's in a border area, Mr. Scott.
The Klingons also claim jurisdiction.

00:35.104 --> 00:37.940
From what I've seen,
it's not worth fighting about.

00:38.108 --> 00:39.222
Why are we here, captain?

00:39.401 --> 00:41.477
My orders are
to cooperate with Ambassador Petri

00:41.653 --> 00:43.527
and all matters pertaining
to his mission here.

00:43.697 --> 00:46.069
- Bridge to Captain Kirk.
- Scotty.

00:47.409 --> 00:50.446
- Kirk here, what is it?
- I have a signal from the Elasians.

00:50.621 --> 00:52.448
They're ready to beam aboard

00:52.623 --> 00:54.414
and they demand an explanation
for the delay.

00:54.583 --> 00:57.999
Demand? What delay?
All right, beam them aboard.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.914
Sounds typical of the Elasians.

01:00.089 --> 01:02.378
The scientists
who made the initial investigation

01:02.550 --> 01:05.302
reported the men were vicious
and arrogant.

01:05.470 --> 01:07.546
Well, that's just the negative part,
Mr. Spock.

01:07.722 --> 01:09.466
I've been over those records.

01:09.641 --> 01:12.761
Now, the women, they're supposed
to be something very special.

01:12.936 --> 01:16.850
They're supposed to have
a kind of a subtle mystical power

01:17.024 --> 01:20.025
that drives men wild.

01:24.031 --> 01:26.107
Ambassador Petri,
would you drop all this nonsense

01:26.283 --> 01:27.481
and tell me what this is about.

01:27.660 --> 01:29.617
That must wait
until the Dohlman is aboard.

01:29.787 --> 01:31.994
The Dohlman?
What the devil is a Dohlman?

01:32.165 --> 01:37.456
The thing most feared and hated
by my people, our most deadly enemy.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.559 --> 01:54.142
Welcome.
I am Petri, ambassador of Troyius.

01:56.982 --> 02:01.941
I'm Captain Kirk.
This ship is under my command.

02:02.697 --> 02:04.820
There's a Troyian here.

02:05.491 --> 02:09.572
I must know that all is secure before
the Dohlman is brought onboard.

02:12.499 --> 02:18.833
This ship is secure and we're prepared
for any hostile acts.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.792
Energize.

02:28.307 --> 02:30.264
Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas.

02:34.897 --> 02:37.768
Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas.

03:16.566 --> 03:20.149
Space, the final frontier.

03:25.534 --> 03:29.698
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:29.872 --> 03:33.786
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:33.959 --> 03:37.744
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:37.922 --> 03:41.920
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.755
You may stand.

04:23.595 --> 04:25.837
Body armour, nuclear weapons.

04:26.014 --> 04:28.340
Not without precedent, captain.
Remember the...

04:28.517 --> 04:30.474
Permission to speak was not given.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.477
You rule this ship?

04:36.650 --> 04:39.817
I am the first officer.
This is Captain James Kirk.

04:39.987 --> 04:43.024
Your Glory, I am Petri.
In the name of my people...

04:43.199 --> 04:45.322
You mission is known to us.

04:45.493 --> 04:49.408
Captain Kirk, you have now permission
to show us to our quarters.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.490
Now, just a moment,
there's gonna have to be

04:53.668 --> 04:57.916
- some kind of understanding...
- Captain, please.

05:02.636 --> 05:07.014
My first officer, Mr. Spock,
will show you to your quarters.

05:07.183 --> 05:11.050
- Ambassador, if I might speak to you.
- You have not been dismissed.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.350
May I have your permission to go?

05:16.776 --> 05:20.691
- You are now dismissed.
- Why, thank you.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.866
Ambassador.

05:27.704 --> 05:31.156
Ambassador, I think it's time
you told me what's going on.

05:31.333 --> 05:36.410
That creature, Elaan,
is to be the wife of our ruler.

05:36.589 --> 05:38.546
To bring peace.

05:38.716 --> 05:43.129
Our two warring planets now possess
the capability of mutual destruction.

05:43.304 --> 05:46.590
Some method of coexistence
must be found.

05:46.766 --> 05:50.634
- I see. So we go back to Troyius.
- Yes.

05:50.812 --> 05:54.810
But slowly, captain. I will need time.

05:54.983 --> 05:58.898
Before we reach there
she must be taught civilised manners.

05:59.071 --> 06:02.570
In her present condition,
my people would never accept her.

06:02.741 --> 06:07.818
- And you are to be her teacher?
- Those are my orders.

06:07.997 --> 06:11.117
I must ask you and your crew
to respect,

06:11.292 --> 06:13.617
or at least tolerate, their arrogance.

06:13.794 --> 06:18.540
- Friction must be kept at a minimum.
- Yes. That I can understand.

06:18.716 --> 06:21.552
Another thing you should
understand, captain.

06:21.719 --> 06:24.211
You have as much
at stake as I have.

06:24.389 --> 06:26.014
Your superiors
have made the statement

06:26.182 --> 06:30.679
that failure of this mission would be
as catastrophic for Federation planning

06:30.854 --> 06:33.392
as it would be for our two planets.

06:33.565 --> 06:41.822
To gain peace at the price of accepting
such a queen is no victory.

06:42.992 --> 06:50.324
I will take her the official gifts I bear.
Perhaps that will soften her mood.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.797
Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius.

06:58.967 --> 07:03.594
Mr. Sulu, impulse drive,
speed factor.037.

07:03.764 --> 07:06.884
- Impulse drive, captain?
- Yes, that's correct, Mr. Sulu.

07:07.059 --> 07:12.220
- Sublight factor.037.
- Aye, aye, sir.

07:12.398 --> 07:17.393
Captain, you'll not be using
the warp drive?

07:18.154 --> 07:20.645
All the way on impulse?

07:22.033 --> 07:24.239
That will take a great deal of time.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.869
Are you in a hurry, Mr. Scott?

07:27.247 --> 07:28.824
No.

07:30.417 --> 07:34.545
Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied
with the quarters provided.

07:34.713 --> 07:36.207
What's the matter with them,
Mr. Spock?

07:36.381 --> 07:40.676
I do not know, but all the Elasians
seem most irrational.

07:40.844 --> 07:42.043
I gave up my quarters because...

07:42.221 --> 07:44.510
Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice,
Lieutenant Uhura.

07:44.682 --> 07:46.840
I'll talk to her myself.

07:52.023 --> 07:53.932
Swine. Take back your gifts.

07:55.318 --> 07:58.901
Your Glory,
these are your wedding slippers.

07:59.072 --> 08:02.192
Your ruler cannot buy the favours
of the Dohlman of Elas.

08:03.744 --> 08:07.788
This is your wedding dress.
A gift from the bridegroom's mother.

08:07.998 --> 08:09.706
I want nothing of his.

08:11.377 --> 08:16.798
This is the most prized of royal jewels,
for your lovely neck.

08:16.966 --> 08:21.046
I would strangle if I was to put the gift
of a Troyian dog around my neck.

08:23.264 --> 08:25.755
Kryton, by whose permission
did he enter?

08:26.893 --> 08:28.933
He came in answer
to your summons.

08:29.104 --> 08:32.105
I understand you're not happy
with your quarters.

08:32.274 --> 08:33.898
Quarters?

08:34.067 --> 08:37.068
Yes, not happy at all.

08:37.236 --> 08:41.235
Am I a soft Troyian fawn
to need pillows to sit on?

08:41.408 --> 08:45.952
And these ridiculous female trapping,
they are an offence to my eyes.

08:46.122 --> 08:50.250
My communications officer
generously vacated the rooms,

08:50.418 --> 08:52.245
hoping you would find it satisfactory.

08:52.420 --> 08:56.999
I do not find them so.
And I find him even less satisfactory.

08:57.175 --> 08:58.586
Must my bitterness be compounded

08:58.760 --> 09:02.592
with that ridiculous ambassador
aboard your ship?

09:03.139 --> 09:05.713
I explained to Her Glory

09:05.892 --> 09:08.929
that her council of nobles
and the Troyius tribunal

09:09.104 --> 09:11.311
jointly agreed that I should instruct...

09:14.318 --> 09:18.185
Make her acquainted with the customs
and manners of our people.

09:18.739 --> 09:21.147
Kryton, remove him.

09:24.579 --> 09:26.655
And take that garbage with you.

09:42.806 --> 09:48.014
He dares to suggest that I adopt
the servile manners of his people.

09:48.187 --> 09:52.137
Your Glory doesn't seem
to be responding to instruction.

09:52.316 --> 09:57.393
I will never forgive the council
for putting me through this torture.

09:59.490 --> 10:03.156
Were you responding
to my demand for better quarters?

10:03.328 --> 10:06.412
There are none better.
I suggest you make do with these.

10:06.581 --> 10:08.206
You suggest?

10:08.375 --> 10:09.703
There are no more available,

10:09.876 --> 10:11.916
but if that's the only way
you can get gratification

10:12.087 --> 10:13.879
I'll arrange to have
the whole room filled,

10:14.047 --> 10:15.874
from floor to ceiling,
with breakable objects.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.256
I will not be humiliated.

10:20.012 --> 10:22.337
Then act in a civilised fashion.

10:22.515 --> 10:24.591
I did not give you
permission to leave.

10:26.936 --> 10:28.347
I didn't ask for any.

10:33.401 --> 10:35.809
Captain, I wish to contact
my government.

10:35.987 --> 10:37.529
I cannot fulfil my mission.

10:37.697 --> 10:40.367
It would be an insult to our ruler
to bring this incorrigible monster

10:40.534 --> 10:42.989
- as a bride.
- Ambassador. Ambassador.

10:43.245 --> 10:46.199
This is supposed to be
a peaceful mission.

10:46.373 --> 10:51.082
There cannot be peace between us.
We have deluded ourselves.

10:51.253 --> 10:54.539
Captain, when I am near them
I do not want peace.

10:54.715 --> 10:57.088
I want to kill them.

10:57.718 --> 10:59.047
You're as bad as she is.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.007
It's not required
that you like each other.

11:02.348 --> 11:04.175
- Just do your job.
- Job?

11:04.350 --> 11:08.479
The job is impossible. We cannot
make peace with people we detest.

11:08.647 --> 11:12.645
Stop trying to kill each other,
then worry about being friendly.

11:12.818 --> 11:16.151
- But if she won't listen to me...
- Then make her listen, ambassador.

11:16.321 --> 11:19.691
Use a different approach.
Stop being so diplomatic.

11:19.867 --> 11:23.152
She respects strength. Go in strong.

11:31.796 --> 11:34.797
At first it appeared
to be a sensor ghost.

11:34.966 --> 11:37.587
But I've run checks
on all the instrumentation.

11:37.761 --> 11:40.382
All the equipment
is functioning perfectly.

11:40.555 --> 11:42.548
Hydrogen-cloud reflection?

11:42.724 --> 11:45.511
None in this area.
Nothing that would account for it.

11:45.686 --> 11:49.766
- The ghost appears intermittently.
- Speculation?

11:50.774 --> 11:53.610
None, captain. Insufficient data.

11:53.777 --> 11:55.320
It's not an instrument malfunction.

11:55.488 --> 11:58.654
It's not a reflection
from a natural phenomenon.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.529
A spaceship?

12:00.701 --> 12:03.406
Engineering to Captain Kirk.

12:03.913 --> 12:04.944
Kirk here.

12:05.123 --> 12:08.124
Captain, I know what you said
about showing respect,

12:08.293 --> 12:12.622
but must I have these persons
fool around with my equipment?

12:13.548 --> 12:14.580
Hang on, Scotty.

12:14.758 --> 12:17.545
Be pleasant no matter how much
it hurts. I'll be right down.

12:22.141 --> 12:24.217
We're only running
on impulse engines now.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.765
Ordinarily, we use the warp engines
exclusively.

12:26.937 --> 12:31.149
Well, I suppose, lassie,

12:31.317 --> 12:33.986
that even our impulse engines
must seem fast

12:34.153 --> 12:37.320
compared to your
nuclear-propulsion units.

12:37.490 --> 12:44.027
We're interested in how the ship
is used in combat, not in what drives it.

12:44.790 --> 12:47.826
Engines are for mechanics
and menials.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.793
Menials?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.246
Without engines
there'd be no fighting or...

12:52.423 --> 12:53.833
Mr. Scott.

12:54.174 --> 12:58.468
I wish you had told me that you wanted
a tour of the Engineering Department.

12:58.637 --> 13:00.926
Do we not have the freedom
of this ship?

13:01.098 --> 13:02.842
We have granted your crew
the permission

13:03.017 --> 13:06.220
not to kneel in our presence.
What else do you want?

13:06.396 --> 13:08.638
Courtesy. Remember?

13:08.815 --> 13:11.187
Courtesy is not for inferiors.

13:11.359 --> 13:14.146
Courtesy is for everyone
around here.

13:14.321 --> 13:18.188
And you'll find you won't be able
to exist on Troyius without it.

13:19.076 --> 13:20.274
Mr. Scott, our chief engineer,

13:20.452 --> 13:22.575
has shown you his
Engineering Department as a courtesy.

13:22.746 --> 13:25.202
You respond by saying,
"Thank you."

13:32.214 --> 13:34.254
Bridge to captain.

13:37.303 --> 13:40.922
- Kirk here.
- That sensor ghost is moving closer.

13:41.224 --> 13:42.967
On my way.

13:44.894 --> 13:47.053
Lost contact now.

13:48.732 --> 13:51.057
Captain, we had a momentary fix
on the object,

13:51.234 --> 13:53.061
long enough
to establish it was a spaceship.

13:53.237 --> 13:54.731
- Whose?
- No data yet.

13:54.905 --> 13:59.733
Captain, distant bearing, sir.
Mark 73.5.

14:00.411 --> 14:03.328
Main screen, extreme magnification.

14:14.467 --> 14:17.005
Our ghost has materialised.

14:17.178 --> 14:18.922
A Klingon warship.

14:33.446 --> 14:34.940
Any change, Mr. Spock?

14:35.406 --> 14:38.941
Negative, captain. The Klingon ship
had simply moved into contact range.

14:39.118 --> 14:42.155
She's pacing us,
precisely matching our sublight speed

14:42.330 --> 14:44.868
and on a parallel course.

14:58.806 --> 15:01.178
- Security to Captain Kirk.
- Kirk here. What is it?

15:01.350 --> 15:03.010
Disturbance
in the Dohlman's quarters, sir.

15:03.185 --> 15:04.845
On my way.

15:11.402 --> 15:13.027
Captain, it's Ambassador Petri.

15:13.196 --> 15:15.948
They refused
to explain what's happening but...

15:17.659 --> 15:19.237
Her Glory has not summoned you.

15:21.830 --> 15:25.329
Kryton, remove that Troyian pig.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.984
It was a deep wound, Jim.
He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover.

15:52.153 --> 15:56.981
If I recover,
it will be no thanks to you, captain.

15:57.159 --> 16:00.528
Yes, well, I said, "Talk with her,"
not, "Fight with her."

16:00.704 --> 16:04.038
I should have known better
than to talk to her unarmed.

16:04.208 --> 16:09.203
But you forced me.
I hold you responsible for this.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.334
Well, I've heard of reluctant brides,
but this is ridiculous.

16:12.508 --> 16:15.130
Captain Kirk,
may I speak with you, sir?

16:15.303 --> 16:17.046
Yes, certainly.

16:17.222 --> 16:19.795
A message just came in
from Starfleet Command.

16:19.974 --> 16:21.884
It was Class-A security,
and scrambled.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.053
- I put it through the decoder.
- What was it?

16:24.229 --> 16:26.471
The Federation high commissioner
is on his way to Troyius

16:26.648 --> 16:28.059
to attend the royal wedding.

16:28.233 --> 16:31.400
Ambassador,
if Elasian women are that vicious,

16:31.570 --> 16:34.405
why are men so overwhelmingly
attracted to them?

16:34.573 --> 16:37.444
I mean,
what magic do they possess?

16:37.618 --> 16:41.486
It's not magic. It's biochemical.

16:41.664 --> 16:46.622
A man whose flesh is once touched
by the tears of a woman of Elas

16:46.794 --> 16:49.961
has his heart enslaved forever.

16:50.465 --> 16:53.881
Ambassador,
there's an added complication.

16:54.052 --> 16:57.255
The Federation high commissioner
will be attending the wedding.

16:57.431 --> 16:59.388
The fat will be in the fire
when he learns

16:59.558 --> 17:02.393
the bride just tried
to murder the groom's ambassador.

17:02.561 --> 17:05.313
There will be no wedding.

17:05.481 --> 17:08.268
I would not have our ruler
marry that monster

17:08.442 --> 17:11.977
if the entire galaxy depended on it.

17:12.821 --> 17:15.146
And I will have nothing further
to do with you.

17:15.324 --> 17:17.281
I'm not asking you
to have anything to do with me.

17:17.452 --> 17:20.239
Just do your job with her. How long
will it be before he's on his feet?

17:20.413 --> 17:23.699
Lt'll be a few days,
a week at least, Jim.

17:24.166 --> 17:29.162
Here you put me, captain.
Here I will stay.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.628
I have nothing further to say to you.

17:37.640 --> 17:42.302
So Ambassador Petri
is going to recover.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.850
That is too bad.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.473
You have delivered your message,
now you may go.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.568
Nothing would please me more,
Your Glory.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.694
But your impetuous nature...

17:52.864 --> 17:56.315
Your Troyian pig was here
in my quarters without any permission,

17:56.493 --> 18:00.158
so I stabbed him.
Just to be Troyian is enough.

18:00.330 --> 18:05.621
You Elasians pride yourself
on being a warrior people.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.961
You must understand discipline
to be able to give and take orders.

18:09.131 --> 18:14.173
Now, my orders are
to take you to Troyius to be married

18:14.345 --> 18:16.670
and to see to it
that you learn Troyian customs.

18:16.848 --> 18:21.059
I despise Troyian. Any contact
with them makes me feel soiled.

18:21.227 --> 18:24.928
It's been my experience
that the prejudices people feel

18:25.106 --> 18:28.357
about each other disappear
when they get to know each other.

18:28.526 --> 18:31.100
It's not in my experience.

18:34.199 --> 18:37.485
Well, we're still faced
with the same problem.

18:37.661 --> 18:38.859
Problem?

18:39.038 --> 18:43.415
Yes, the problem of your indoctrination
to Troyian customs and manners.

18:44.543 --> 18:47.544
- I have eliminated that problem.
- You've eliminated the teacher.

18:47.713 --> 18:49.373
The problem still remains.

18:52.302 --> 18:54.875
And how do we solve the problem?

18:55.388 --> 18:59.801
By giving you a new teacher.

19:03.438 --> 19:07.222
- Tell me, what can you teach me?
- Table manners, for one thing.

19:07.401 --> 19:11.399
This is a plate. It contains food.

19:11.572 --> 19:14.145
This is a knife. It cuts the food.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.732
- This is a glass.
- Leave me.

19:16.911 --> 19:19.912
Like it or not, you're gonna learn
what you've been ordered to learn.

19:25.587 --> 19:27.579
You will return me to Elas
immediately.

19:28.006 --> 19:31.090
- That's impossible.
- Everything I order is possible.

19:31.509 --> 19:34.261
That's the first problem we're gonna
work on. Then we'll get you ready

19:34.429 --> 19:36.636
- to go to Troyius.
- I will not go to Troyius.

19:36.807 --> 19:40.342
I will not be made into a Troyian,
and I will not be humiliated.

19:40.519 --> 19:46.059
And I will not be given to a green pig
as a bribe to stop a war.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.781
If you enjoy the privileges
and prerogatives of being a Dohlman,

19:53.950 --> 19:56.026
then be worthy of them.

19:57.453 --> 20:02.163
If you don't want the obligations that
go along with the title, then give it up.

20:02.334 --> 20:06.201
- Nobody speaks to me that way.
- That's another one of your problems.

20:06.380 --> 20:08.871
Nobody's told you
that you're an uncivilised savage.

20:09.049 --> 20:12.003
A vicious child in a woman's body.
An arrogant monster.

20:16.974 --> 20:20.011
That's no way to treat someone
who's telling you the truth.

20:31.322 --> 20:33.481
Tomorrow's lesson
will be on courtesy.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.883
Lieutenant, open up
the hailing frequency, identify us,

20:53.054 --> 20:56.339
- and ask the Klingon his intentions.
- Aye, sir.

21:46.151 --> 21:49.567
Captain, no response from
the Klingon vessel on any channel.

21:49.738 --> 21:53.108
I see. All right, lieutenant,
monitor all frequencies.

21:53.284 --> 21:55.905
Phaser crews, stand by.
Maintain Yellow Alert.

21:57.079 --> 21:59.037
What are you doing?

22:36.830 --> 22:38.454
No one may enter
the Dohlman's presence.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.450
- Where's Kryton?
- On business.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.168
No one may enter
the Dohlman's presence.

22:42.335 --> 22:43.415
Will you tell Her Glory

22:43.587 --> 22:46.623
that Captain Kirk
requests the honour of a visit?

22:46.798 --> 22:48.957
The Dohlman has promised
that I will be whipped to death

22:49.134 --> 22:51.839
if I let Captain Kirk pass
through that door.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.648
Thank you, Mr. Spock. When they
wake up, take them to security hold.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.686
Captain, your analysis of the situation
was flawless.

23:05.860 --> 23:08.268
Anticipating that she would
deny you admittance.

23:08.446 --> 23:12.610
However, the logic by which you
arrived at your conclusion escapes me.

23:12.784 --> 23:15.536
Mr. Spock,
the women on your planet are logical.

23:15.704 --> 23:19.784
That's the only planet in this galaxy
that could make that claim.

23:25.798 --> 23:27.755
You dare touch a member
of the royal family?

23:27.925 --> 23:30.796
Only in self-defence.

23:31.971 --> 23:34.509
Now, are you gonna behave or not?

23:35.308 --> 23:38.594
The penalty is death
for what you are doing.

23:38.770 --> 23:40.015
We're not on Elas.

23:40.188 --> 23:43.391
We're on my starship.
I command here.

23:49.865 --> 23:52.570
You are warned, captain,
never to touch me again.

23:52.743 --> 23:54.237
If I touch you again, Your Glory,

23:54.411 --> 23:57.199
it'll be to administer an ancient
Earth custom called a spanking.

23:57.373 --> 24:00.908
A form of punishment
administered to spoiled brats.

24:01.085 --> 24:02.959
You have my leave to go.

24:03.129 --> 24:07.423
You forget, Your Glory, we haven't
started your lesson in courtesy.

24:07.592 --> 24:09.383
You can teach me nothing, captain.

24:09.552 --> 24:12.222
If I have to stay here
for ten light-years,

24:12.389 --> 24:15.140
I will not be soiled
by any contact with you.

24:15.308 --> 24:17.978
Very well,
I'll send in Mr. Spock or Dr. McCoy.

24:18.145 --> 24:20.387
You're gonna be properly prepared
for Troyius.

24:20.564 --> 24:23.648
As ordered by councils,
rulers and bureaucrats.

24:25.402 --> 24:26.482
Captain.

24:28.155 --> 24:31.073
- There's one thing you can teach me.
- No, you were right the first time.

24:31.242 --> 24:33.815
There's nothing I can teach you.
There's nothing you do not know.

24:33.995 --> 24:36.747
I don't know
how to make people like me.

24:40.627 --> 24:43.912
I don't want everybody to hate me.

24:45.257 --> 24:49.124
Well, it's not that people hate you.

24:49.511 --> 24:53.675
It's just that people don't like to be
treated as though they don't exist.

25:08.281 --> 25:12.113
It's gotten very...

25:12.952 --> 25:15.953
Something must have gone wrong
with the ventilation system.

25:16.122 --> 25:19.955
- Captain?
- Pardon me, Your Glory.

25:20.127 --> 25:23.044
- There will be a short recess.
- Captain?

25:46.196 --> 25:52.317
Captain, that ancient Earth custom
called spanking. What is it?

25:53.286 --> 25:55.078
It's...

25:58.041 --> 26:00.165
It's...

26:00.586 --> 26:02.662
We'll talk about it later.

26:18.772 --> 26:22.935
- Bridge to Captain Kirk. Mr. Spock...
- I have it on my sensor, lieutenant.

26:23.110 --> 26:25.517
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

26:26.029 --> 26:28.947
Come in, please. Captain Kirk.

26:29.324 --> 26:31.531
- Please answer.
- Kirk here.

26:31.702 --> 26:35.866
Captain, I'm picking up transmission
from inside the Enterprise.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.745
It's on a tight beam
aimed at the Klingon vessel.

26:40.253 --> 26:42.826
Inside the Enterprise?

26:44.132 --> 26:45.959
Can you pinpoint it?

26:46.134 --> 26:50.001
Spock here, captain.
I am triangulating now.

26:51.556 --> 26:55.388
It's coming from
the Engineering section.

26:58.897 --> 27:02.349
Security to Engineering,
intruder alert.

27:03.903 --> 27:07.568
Security alert to all decks. Kirk out.

27:28.762 --> 27:31.763
Nobody saw him, but the devil
sneaked back in here some way.

27:31.932 --> 27:34.008
Watson must have caught him
and he was killed for it.

27:34.184 --> 27:37.554
He had this.
Looks like some sort of transmitter.

27:37.772 --> 27:40.345
- It's Klingon. Bones?
- Captain.

27:40.775 --> 27:43.147
Neck snapped clean.

27:43.986 --> 27:46.608
What kind of a signal
did you send the Klingon ship?

27:46.781 --> 27:48.987
Captain, you must know
I will tell you nothing.

27:49.159 --> 27:51.365
Our interrogation techniques
are more excruciating

27:51.536 --> 27:52.699
than you are even capable of.

27:52.871 --> 27:56.916
Yes, I'm aware you're trained
to resist any form of physical torture.

27:58.251 --> 27:59.959
- Kirk to Spock.
- Spock here, captain.

28:00.128 --> 28:02.999
Mr. Spock,
it was Kryton transmitting.

28:03.173 --> 28:06.756
He refuses to talk.
I'll need you for the Vulcan mind-meld.

28:14.101 --> 28:15.928
Captain, I'm sorry, but he seemed...

28:16.104 --> 28:18.429
What was he trying to cover
that was so important

28:18.606 --> 28:19.887
he felt he had to die for it?

28:20.066 --> 28:23.731
Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering
just to use the transmitter.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.442
I want you to check
every relay you've got.

28:26.615 --> 28:28.275
Captain, you must realise the time...

28:28.450 --> 28:31.784
Don't waste the time
telling me about it. Get to it.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.152
Aye.

28:33.330 --> 28:36.082
Kryton was of a noble family.

28:36.250 --> 28:39.167
He loved me
and wanted to marry me.

28:39.336 --> 28:42.670
He was furious when he heard of the
announcement of the wedding plans.

28:42.840 --> 28:46.375
And he sold out to the Klingons
because of jealousy?

28:46.552 --> 28:48.592
Probably.

28:48.888 --> 28:55.140
But why speak of unimportant matters
when we can speak about us?

28:56.688 --> 29:00.187
There's a Klingon warship out there.
What's their involvement?

29:00.358 --> 29:05.068
Surely all of this isn't because
they want to stop a marriage.

29:05.739 --> 29:08.693
We should welcome their help.

29:10.870 --> 29:12.661
Elaan.

29:13.748 --> 29:15.158
Elaan.

29:15.333 --> 29:21.336
Two planets, an entire star system's
stability depends on it.

29:21.506 --> 29:26.963
We have a duty
to forget what happened.

29:27.137 --> 29:30.885
Could you do that?
Could you give me to another man?

29:31.057 --> 29:37.974
My orders and yours
say that you belong to another man.

29:39.191 --> 29:41.267
What happened...

29:43.404 --> 29:49.074
What happened was an accident.

29:49.994 --> 29:56.282
It was no accident.
I chose you and you chose me.

30:00.297 --> 30:02.539
I have a plan.

30:03.884 --> 30:09.223
With this ship, you could
completely obliterate Troyius.

30:12.101 --> 30:17.392
Then there would be no need
for the marriage.

30:20.902 --> 30:27.818
And in gratitude, my people would give
you the complete rule of this system.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.409
What kind of a mind
could think of such a thing?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.988
He's a Troyian.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.460
Captain?

30:45.010 --> 30:48.426
You cannot resist my love, my love.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.222
Captain.

31:04.573 --> 31:06.980
May we see you a moment?

31:10.537 --> 31:12.032
Jim.

31:13.290 --> 31:16.825
Jim. May we please
have a word with you?

31:32.352 --> 31:36.017
Captain, are you all right?

31:36.648 --> 31:38.392
- Did she cry, Jim?
- What?

31:38.567 --> 31:42.066
Did she cry?
Did her tears touch you at any time?

31:49.078 --> 31:50.620
We're in trouble.

31:50.788 --> 31:52.911
Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine

31:53.082 --> 31:56.036
that the Elasian women have a sort of
a biochemical substance in their tears

31:56.210 --> 32:01.964
that acts like a super love potion.
According to him, it doesn't wear off.

32:02.842 --> 32:06.923
- It is true, then, captain?
- It's true.

32:07.931 --> 32:10.054
Bones, you've got to find me
an antidote.

32:10.225 --> 32:12.716
I'll try, but I'll need test of...

32:12.936 --> 32:14.728
Bridge to captain.

32:20.402 --> 32:21.434
Captain here.

32:21.612 --> 32:23.771
Captain, the Klingon ship
has changed course.

32:23.948 --> 32:27.032
It is heading toward us
at warp speed.

32:27.201 --> 32:30.950
On my way. Battle stations.

32:48.599 --> 32:52.597
- Phasers stand by.
- Phasers ready, sir.

32:55.856 --> 32:59.226
Their speed is better than warp 6,
captain.

33:00.611 --> 33:06.531
Mr. Chekov, lay in a course
to take us out of this star system.

33:08.286 --> 33:11.157
If they wanna fight,
let's get some manoeuvring room.

33:11.331 --> 33:14.202
- Course computed, sir.
- Laid in, captain.

33:14.376 --> 33:16.285
All right. Ahead, warp factor 2.

33:16.462 --> 33:19.249
- Captain, the matter-antimatter...
- Belay that order.

33:19.423 --> 33:20.454
What is it, Scotty?

33:20.633 --> 33:24.962
The antimatter pods are rigged to blow
up the moment we go into warp drive.

33:41.822 --> 33:44.063
Scotty, that bomb he planted,
can you dismantle it?

33:44.241 --> 33:46.399
Not without being blown
halfway across the galaxy.

33:48.495 --> 33:51.165
Give us every ounce of power you can
from the impulse drive.

33:51.332 --> 33:54.167
And find a solution to the bomb.
Kirk out.

33:54.668 --> 33:57.290
Sulu, stand by
to make your manoeuvres smartly.

33:57.463 --> 33:59.622
- She'll be sluggish on response.
- Aye, sir.

33:59.799 --> 34:02.041
One hundred thousand kilometres.

34:02.218 --> 34:03.712
Ninety.

34:04.804 --> 34:06.512
Eighty.

34:10.851 --> 34:13.224
Phaser crews,
stand by to fire on command.

34:13.396 --> 34:15.223
Sixty.

34:15.815 --> 34:18.900
- Ready.
- Fifty.

34:21.029 --> 34:22.109
Hold your fire.

34:26.202 --> 34:28.029
She's passed us
without firing a shot.

34:28.454 --> 34:30.696
I don't think they meant to attack us.

34:35.378 --> 34:38.047
We were very fortunate this time.

34:43.678 --> 34:46.679
Yes, their tactics are quite clear now,
Mr. Spock.

34:46.848 --> 34:48.924
They were trying
to make us cut in warp drive.

34:49.101 --> 34:52.386
That way, we'd have blow ourselves up
and solved their problem for them

34:52.563 --> 34:54.768
without risking war
with the Federation. Very neat.

34:54.940 --> 34:56.054
Very.

34:56.233 --> 34:59.899
But why do the Klingons consider
the position of this system so vital?

35:00.404 --> 35:04.568
Yes, a very good question,
Mr. Spock.

35:06.494 --> 35:08.403
I have another question, captain.

35:08.580 --> 35:12.791
Is not the Bridge the wrong place
for the Dohlman, at a time like this?

35:12.959 --> 35:14.074
I'll be the judge of...

35:19.841 --> 35:22.926
Yes. You're quite right.

35:25.848 --> 35:27.093
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

35:37.402 --> 35:42.609
I want you to go to Sickbay.
It's the best-protected part of the ship.

35:44.159 --> 35:45.439
I want to be by your side.

35:45.619 --> 35:49.782
Your presence here
is interfering with my efficiency,

35:50.165 --> 35:52.205
my ability to protect you.

35:54.294 --> 35:56.620
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

36:02.803 --> 36:04.677
Deck 5.

36:05.515 --> 36:10.260
I love you. I have chosen you.

36:11.145 --> 36:14.930
And still I don't understand
why you didn't fight the Klingon.

36:15.483 --> 36:17.891
If I can accomplish my mission
by turning tail and running,

36:18.069 --> 36:20.477
I'll gladly do that.

36:20.655 --> 36:23.941
And that mission
is to take me to Troyius?

36:24.117 --> 36:25.695
Yes.

36:28.956 --> 36:32.823
Would you have me wearing
my wedding dress for another man

36:33.002 --> 36:35.575
and never see you again?

36:37.381 --> 36:39.173
Yes, Elaan.

36:40.009 --> 36:42.963
Are you happy at the prospect?

36:46.391 --> 36:47.506
No.

36:47.684 --> 36:49.593
Scott to captain.

36:50.729 --> 36:53.267
- Kirk here.
- I've got bad news, captain.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.940
The entire dilithium-crystal-converter
assembly is fused.

36:57.111 --> 37:00.859
No chance of repair.
It's completely unusable.

37:01.031 --> 37:04.531
- No chance of restoring warp drive?
- Not without dilithium crystals.

37:04.702 --> 37:07.573
We can't even generate
enough power to fire our weapons.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.371
Kirk out.

37:09.874 --> 37:12.199
My love, I have to go back
to the Bridge.

37:12.377 --> 37:14.784
Please, you must go to the Sickbay.

37:14.963 --> 37:17.169
Yes, my love.

37:21.553 --> 37:26.180
Test number 24. Colladium trioxide
in an algobarium solution.

37:27.935 --> 37:31.220
- Results also negative.
- Doctor.

37:31.397 --> 37:35.264
There is no antidote
to the poison of Elasian tears.

37:35.443 --> 37:40.021
The men of Elas have tried desperately
for centuries to dispel its power.

37:40.198 --> 37:45.192
- You're wasting your time, doctor.
- It is my time to waste, ambassador.

37:45.370 --> 37:46.994
Doctor.

37:47.914 --> 37:50.915
The captain asked me
to come here for safety.

37:51.084 --> 37:52.911
Safety?

37:53.086 --> 37:58.626
What is your estimate
of our chances for survival, doctor?

37:59.301 --> 38:04.010
That is the captain's responsibility,
ambassador.

38:06.267 --> 38:08.306
Captain, message from
the Klingon ship.

38:08.477 --> 38:11.265
They are ordering us to stand by
for boarding or be destroyed.

38:11.439 --> 38:15.519
- They demand an immediate reply.
- They're trying to force a fight.

38:15.693 --> 38:17.651
Scotty, what's our energy status?

38:17.821 --> 38:19.481
Ninety-three percent
of impulse power, sir.

38:19.656 --> 38:23.784
- We can still manoeuvre.
- Manoeuvre? Aye.

38:23.952 --> 38:27.701
We can wallow like a garbage scow
against a warp-driven starship.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.367
Our shields will hold
for a few passes,

38:29.541 --> 38:32.626
but without the matter-antimatter
reactor, we've no chance.

38:32.795 --> 38:36.128
Captain, can you not call Starfleet
on this emergency?

38:36.298 --> 38:37.958
And let the Klingons know
they succeeded

38:38.134 --> 38:39.332
in wiping out our warp engines?

38:39.510 --> 38:42.962
Help could not possibly arrive before
the Enterprise would be destroyed.

38:43.139 --> 38:50.471
Now that we are all about to die,
I ask you once again

38:50.647 --> 38:57.528
to accept this necklace
and to wear it as a token of respect

38:57.696 --> 39:05.074
for the desperate wishes
of your people and mine, for peace.

39:09.166 --> 39:12.002
That's all you men of other worlds
can speak of,

39:12.169 --> 39:14.577
duty and responsibility.

39:14.755 --> 39:21.339
We'll stall for time, proceed on course
and hope the Klingons can be bluffed,

39:21.513 --> 39:24.300
or that they're not prepared
for a general war.

39:24.474 --> 39:29.017
- Open a hailing frequency.
- Frequency open, sir.

39:30.355 --> 39:33.689
This is Captain James Kirk
of the USS Enterprise,

39:33.859 --> 39:35.899
on Federation business.

39:36.070 --> 39:38.193
Our mission is peaceful,

39:38.364 --> 39:41.199
but we're not prepared
to accept any interference.

39:47.206 --> 39:52.663
Enterprise, prepare to be
boarded or destroyed.

39:56.883 --> 40:00.217
I'd say our strategy
wasn't totally effective.

40:00.387 --> 40:03.258
Captain, the Klingon ship
is closing on an intercept course,

40:03.432 --> 40:04.807
500,000 kilometres.

40:05.476 --> 40:07.433
Deflector shields up.

40:08.479 --> 40:12.429
Scotty, can you give me partial power
on the phaser banks?

40:12.608 --> 40:17.151
- No, sir. Not a chance.
- Three hundred thousand kilometres.

40:22.911 --> 40:26.861
I told you to stay in Sickbay.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.490
I want to die with you.

40:35.382 --> 40:37.339
We're not going to die.

40:38.010 --> 40:41.675
- Now, get off the Bridge.
- One hundred thousand kilometres.

40:44.767 --> 40:46.925
It's passed us. All shields held.

40:47.103 --> 40:52.144
Sulu, bring her to 143, mark 2.
Keep our forward shields to him.

40:53.484 --> 40:56.936
- Here he comes again, sir.
- Stay with the controls.

40:57.113 --> 41:00.945
Keep our forward shields to him.

41:06.915 --> 41:08.113
Better than warp 7.

41:08.292 --> 41:10.865
Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around,
he's going for our flank.

41:16.592 --> 41:18.336
- Sulu.
- Sorry, captain.

41:18.511 --> 41:20.219
She won't respond fast enough
on impulse.

41:20.388 --> 41:23.638
He's passed us again.
Damage to number 4 shield.

41:24.434 --> 41:25.465
How bad?

41:25.643 --> 41:30.305
It will not withstand
another full charge, captain.

41:30.982 --> 41:33.687
I'm getting some very peculiar
energy readings.

41:34.736 --> 41:36.812
He's paralleling us again.

41:37.531 --> 41:39.358
He seems
to have broken off the attack.

41:41.827 --> 41:43.369
What sort of readings, Mr. Spock?

41:50.253 --> 41:52.210
She is the source.

41:54.006 --> 41:55.833
Elaan?

42:05.852 --> 42:07.726
The necklace.

42:09.273 --> 42:12.024
- What kind of jewels are in this?
- They call them radans.

42:12.192 --> 42:15.028
The necklace is supposed
to bring you luck.

42:15.195 --> 42:18.778
It is of little value.
They are common stones.

42:21.369 --> 42:24.038
These are common stones?

42:24.705 --> 42:28.157
See, captain? Here and here.

42:28.501 --> 42:33.080
Common stones. Now I see why the
Klingons are interested in this system.

42:33.256 --> 42:37.171
- May I have this?
- If I can be of any help, of course.

42:37.344 --> 42:39.383
You may have just saved our lives.

42:39.554 --> 42:43.884
Mr. Spock, do you think Scotty
could make use of dilithium crystals?

42:44.059 --> 42:45.553
No doubt, captain.

42:45.728 --> 42:47.934
He's coming in again, sir.

42:50.691 --> 42:54.475
Mr. Sulu, prepare on my order
to turn quickly to port.

42:54.654 --> 42:57.489
- Try and protect the number 4 shield.
- Aye, sir.

43:09.628 --> 43:10.790
Now, Sulu. Hard to port.

43:15.509 --> 43:17.585
Shields holding but weakened, sir.

43:17.761 --> 43:21.806
Captain, message coming in.

43:22.892 --> 43:26.937
Enterprise, our readings confirm
your power extremely low,

43:27.105 --> 43:29.263
your shields buckling.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.192
This is your last chance
to surrender.

43:34.237 --> 43:36.526
Captain, number 4 shield
just collapsed.

43:37.032 --> 43:39.949
Impulse power down to 31 percent.

43:43.455 --> 43:46.125
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a hailing frequency.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.454
Channel open, sir.

43:47.626 --> 43:53.462
This is Captain James Kirk
of the United spaceship Enterprise.

43:53.632 --> 43:58.591
May I request your terms
for surrender?

43:59.639 --> 44:05.144
No terms. Surrender must
be unconditional and immediate.

44:08.607 --> 44:09.852
Scotty, your estimate.

44:10.942 --> 44:14.892
We're fitting it now, sir, but we'll have
to run a few tests to make sure.

44:15.072 --> 44:16.352
Test it in combat.

44:17.199 --> 44:20.983
Captain, these are crude crystals.
There is no way to judge

44:21.161 --> 44:24.163
what the unusual shapes will do
to the energy flow.

44:24.457 --> 44:26.449
Aye. They could blow us up
just as effectively as...

44:26.626 --> 44:28.618
Let me know when it's in place.

44:28.836 --> 44:31.458
- Open a hailing frequency.
- Hailing frequency open, sir.

44:31.631 --> 44:33.588
This is the Enterprise.

44:33.758 --> 44:38.385
Will you guarantee
the safety of our passenger,

44:38.555 --> 44:40.678
the Dohlman from Elas?

44:40.849 --> 44:44.348
No conditions.
Surrender immediately.

44:45.854 --> 44:48.524
Captain, he's starting his run.

44:54.989 --> 44:59.366
Scott to captain. It's in place, sir.
But I can't answer for what happens.

44:59.535 --> 45:01.279
You and Spock get up here.

45:01.454 --> 45:04.704
- Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres.
- Aye, sir.

45:04.874 --> 45:09.620
- Chekov, arm photon torpedoes.
- Photon torpedoes ready.

45:09.796 --> 45:12.121
- Warp power to the shields, captain?
- Negative.

45:12.299 --> 45:14.706
His sensors
will pick up our power increase.

45:14.885 --> 45:18.336
The more helpless he thinks we are,
the closer he'll come.

45:18.514 --> 45:21.384
As he passes,
I wanna cut in warp drive.

45:21.558 --> 45:25.722
We'll pivot at warp 2
and bring all tubes to bear.

45:25.896 --> 45:28.352
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Chekov,

45:28.524 --> 45:31.062
give him a full spread
of photon torpedoes.

45:31.235 --> 45:33.062
Aye, captain.

45:45.083 --> 45:47.242
One hundred thousand kilometres.

45:47.419 --> 45:50.206
Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive.

45:50.380 --> 45:53.584
Fluctuation. It's the shape
of the crystals. I was afraid of that.

45:53.759 --> 45:59.430
Seventy-five, 70, 60,

45:59.598 --> 46:01.342
- 50,
- Fire at minimum range.

46:01.517 --> 46:03.474
- 40,
- She won't steady down.

46:03.644 --> 46:04.843
30...

46:10.735 --> 46:13.606
Warp in, Scotty.
Full power to shields.

46:21.955 --> 46:27.828
Warp factor 2.
Bring us to course 148, mark 3.

46:33.718 --> 46:37.169
Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire.

46:37.347 --> 46:38.971
Aye, sir.

46:45.605 --> 46:47.681
Direct hit amidships,
by photon torpedo.

46:47.858 --> 46:51.606
Damage to Klingon number 3 shield.
Number 4 shield obliterated.

46:51.778 --> 46:53.486
Loss of manoeuvring power.

46:53.655 --> 46:58.733
He is badly damaged, captain.
Continuing away at reduced speed.

46:59.662 --> 47:01.987
Secure from general quarters.

47:02.164 --> 47:05.118
Well done, Mr. Sulu, Scotty.

47:05.293 --> 47:07.581
But I don't understand you.

47:07.754 --> 47:10.042
You mean you won't pursue
and finish him off?

47:10.214 --> 47:11.673
No.

47:13.259 --> 47:15.335
Mr. Sulu,
resume course for Troyius.

47:16.346 --> 47:18.173
Aye, aye, sir.

47:49.297 --> 47:51.919
You will not beam down
for the ceremony?

47:52.092 --> 47:53.123
No.

47:57.055 --> 48:03.011
I want you to have this
as a personal memento.

48:03.521 --> 48:07.388
I have learned that on Troyius
they do not wear such things.

48:11.738 --> 48:13.113
Remember me.

48:14.991 --> 48:18.443
- I have no choice.
- Nor have I.

48:18.995 --> 48:23.954
I have only responsibilities
and obligations.

48:28.589 --> 48:29.620
Goodbye.

48:31.592 --> 48:32.790
Goodbye.

48:44.939 --> 48:46.647
Energize.

49:05.544 --> 49:07.751
It's stabilised now.

49:08.965 --> 49:13.294
Spock, I've isolated the biochemical
substance of the Elasian tears.

49:13.469 --> 49:16.470
It's a kind of an infection,
and I think I've found an antidote.

49:16.639 --> 49:19.344
You're too late, doctor. The captain
has found his own antidote.

49:19.517 --> 49:22.187
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
Do you know how long I've worked..?

49:22.354 --> 49:25.438
The antidote to a woman of Elas,
doctor, is a starship.

49:25.607 --> 49:28.857
The Enterprise infected the captain
long before the Dohlman did.

49:29.027 --> 49:32.028
Mr. Sulu,
prepare to take us out of orbit.

49:34.241 --> 49:39.662
Well, I doubt seriously if there's any
kind of an antidote for the Enterprise.

49:39.830 --> 49:44.409
In this particular instance, doctor,
I agree with you.

49:44.585 --> 49:46.958
Ahead, warp factor 2.
