00:02.003 --> 00:03.539
Previously on "Teen Wolf":

00:05.590 --> 00:06.625
It's called a Kanima.

00:06.799 --> 00:09.040
Killing may be
its only purpose.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.918
It's fast, remarkably strong,

00:12.180 --> 00:16.219
and has the capacity to render its victims
essentially helpless within seconds.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.388
- It doesn't know what it is.
- Or who.

00:19.562 --> 00:20.768
It's you.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.305
What the hell is wrong with you?
It's like you're immune.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.688
Derek, I want to know
why it didn't work.

00:28.905 --> 00:30.190
What's happening?

00:30.740 --> 00:32.776
- Are you the yearbook photographer?
- ljust take pictures.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.942
- Just lacrosse or other things?
- Anything that catches my eye.

00:37.038 --> 00:40.451
- You saying you know who it is?
- No, but I think it knew me.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.219
More.

01:06.776 --> 01:07.982
Okay.

01:17.662 --> 01:21.246
- No, I said don't help me!
- Don't help you as in don't spot you

01:21.457 --> 01:24.119
or don't help you as in
let the bar crush your throat?

01:24.627 --> 01:26.458
I should be able
to do twice that.

01:27.046 --> 01:29.002
On the moon... maybe.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.259
I'm hitting the shower.
If I come back

01:39.475 --> 01:42.387
and you're lying dead underneath
a pile of weight, I'm taking the Porsche.

02:20.766 --> 02:21.972
Come on.

02:39.619 --> 02:40.779
Thanks.

02:41.287 --> 02:42.322
Any time.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.962
What happened to you on
the night of the full moon?

02:58.429 --> 02:59.544
What?

02:59.764 --> 03:01.800
Nothing. Nothing happened.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.639
You're lying.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.232
No, wait, I can prove it.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.437
l taped myself.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.356
You taped yourself?

03:20.534 --> 03:24.152
Yes. It was the full moon. And maybe
while you were curled in the corner

03:24.330 --> 03:26.616
having an existential crisis
about turning into a monster,

03:26.791 --> 03:29.498
l was preparing for the so-called gift
your big, bad Alpha promised me,

03:29.669 --> 03:31.205
and what did I get?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.960
Nothing.

03:33.172 --> 03:36.130
You want proof?
Let me get the video.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.675
No.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.716
No, l have a better idea.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.968
What is that?

04:00.157 --> 04:04.617
You know, Jackson,
you've always been kind of a snake.

04:05.705 --> 04:09.573
And everyone knows a snake
can't be poisoned by its own venom.

04:58.382 --> 05:02.796
You're still a snake, Jackson,
just not the one we're looking for.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.269
You're still gonna have
to do one more thing for us.

05:22.782 --> 05:26.900
Well, actually, for me.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.952
So now you're telling me that
you didn't see Isaac and his father

05:38.130 --> 05:39.791
arguing before the murder?

05:41.634 --> 05:43.374
Not exactly.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.379
Not exactly or no?

05:49.058 --> 05:51.549
Because when it comes to the law,
there's a fairly large divide

05:51.769 --> 05:56.183
between not exactly and no.
Like, if "not exactly" were sitting in this chair,

05:56.357 --> 05:58.518
then "no" would be somewhere
in the middle of the pacific ocean,

05:58.692 --> 06:01.104
drowning next to my career!

06:05.032 --> 06:07.114
So what's it gonna be, huh?

06:08.369 --> 06:10.280
Not exactly or no?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.121
No.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.451
Ah, crap.

06:22.842 --> 06:25.174
Dude, ljust talked to my dad,
who just talked to Jackson,

06:25.344 --> 06:28.336
and I've got really terrible,
horrible, very, very bad news.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.425
I think I already know.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.227
All right, I only found one thing online
called the Kanima.

07:18.439 --> 07:22.432
It's a werejaguar from South America
that goes after murderers.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.109
- That thing was not a Jaguar.
- Yeah, and I'm not exactly a murderer.

07:26.322 --> 07:29.906
Yeah, but you did see it kill somebody,
which is probably why it tried to kill you.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.075
And it's still trying to kill you,
and it probably won't stop until you're dead.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.778
You know, sometimes I really begin
to question this "friendship."

07:35.998 --> 07:39.832
It took forever, but I found a
program that can recover your video.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.958
I'll run it in my free
period this afternoon.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.002
Okay, just let me know
when it's done.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.090
So Derek wants this done
during chemistry?

07:49.261 --> 07:52.344
Yeah, and if it's Lydia,
I'm gonna kill the bitch, all right?

07:52.556 --> 07:55.639
- We have to test her first.
- If she's the Kanima?

08:04.652 --> 08:06.984
Hey, testicle left and right.

08:08.948 --> 08:11.155
What the hell is a Kanima?

08:12.576 --> 08:15.534
All right, listen up. A quick warning
before we begin our review.

08:15.746 --> 08:19.364
Some of you, like McCall,
might want to start their own study groups,

08:19.583 --> 08:23.826
because tomorrow's midterm
is so profoundly difficult,

08:24.046 --> 08:26.958
I'm not even too sure
I could pass it.

08:27.383 --> 08:30.750
Okay, I need a volunteer at the board
to answer the first question.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.131
Who's got it, huh?
Come on, let's go, buddy.

08:34.056 --> 08:37.514
Paralyzed from the neck down.
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

08:37.726 --> 08:39.842
I'm familiar with the sensation.

08:40.062 --> 08:43.554
Wait, why would Derek test you?
Why would he think that it's you?

08:43.774 --> 08:45.890
- How should I know?
- Wait, do they think it's Lydia?

08:46.110 --> 08:48.977
I don't know, all I heard was her name
and something about chemistry.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.189
Jackson!

08:50.406 --> 08:53.739
Do you have something you want
to share with the rest of the class?

08:54.952 --> 08:58.615
Just an undying admiration
for my coach.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.571
That's really kind of you.

09:03.002 --> 09:04.583
Now shut up!

09:04.753 --> 09:06.334
Shut it!

09:06.547 --> 09:08.083
Anybody else?

09:12.511 --> 09:14.251
How do we know it's not her?

09:14.430 --> 09:15.966
Because I looked into the eyes
of that thing, okay?

09:16.140 --> 09:18.131
And what I saw was pure evil.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.013
And when I look into Lydia's eyes,
I only see 50 percent evil.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.687
All right, maybe 60. You know,
but no more than 40 on a good day.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.276
Stiles, that's not
a very good argument.

09:28.444 --> 09:31.151
I'm aware of that,
but I swear it's not her.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.024
It can't be, all right?

09:33.699 --> 09:35.280
Lydia's fine.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.681
Lydia?

10:50.484 --> 10:54.477
Okay then, anybody else
want to try answering?

10:54.696 --> 10:57.153
This time in English?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.951
What is that, Greek?

11:07.167 --> 11:10.079
No, actually,
I think it is English.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.462
Derek is not gonna
kill her without proof.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.638
All right, so he tests her
like he did with Jackson, right?

11:23.809 --> 11:25.595
But when and where?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.559
I think here and now.

11:54.089 --> 11:58.549
Einstein once said,
"Two things are infinite:

11:58.760 --> 12:01.627
The universe and human stupidity.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.467
And I'm not sure about the universe."

12:04.683 --> 12:09.598
I myself have encountered
infinite stupidity.

12:11.190 --> 12:16.025
So to combat the plague of
ignorance in my class,

12:16.236 --> 12:19.945
you're going to combine efforts
through a round of group experiments.

12:20.157 --> 12:24.867
Let's see if two heads are
indeed better than one.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.070
Or in Mr. Stilinski's case,
less than one.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.033
Erica, you take the first station.
You'll start with...

12:37.174 --> 12:39.460
I didn't ask for volunteers.

12:39.635 --> 12:42.798
Put your hormonal
little hands down.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.967
Start with Mr. McCall.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.048
All right, next two.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.228
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, wait.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.111
- Give me a chance to talk to Derek.
- Why don't you talk to me instead?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.737
That's funny.

13:12.542 --> 13:16.535
In school, you guys act like you're
broken up, but she's all over you.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.586
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.583
If I were Allison...

13:23.178 --> 13:25.840
I'd be wanting you...

13:26.640 --> 13:28.756
all the time.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.554
- Never? You never get jealous?
- Why would I?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.766
Because of that thing
happening over there.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.234
That requires some jealousy.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.284
- You're not my type.
- I'm exactly your type.

13:48.704 --> 13:49.989
Switch.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.701
Listen to me, okay?
Don't talk to Erica or Isaac.

13:57.921 --> 13:58.876
- Why?
- Just don't.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.875
Let's go, girls.
Next station.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.956
Trust me, all right?

14:20.736 --> 14:23.352
If you harm one perfect
strawberry blonde hair on her head,

14:23.572 --> 14:25.733
I'm gonna turn your little
werewolf ass into a fur coat

14:25.907 --> 14:28.239
and give it to her
as a birthday present.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.658
Really?

14:29.828 --> 14:34.413
I've never actually been to one of her
big, invite-only birthday parties.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.832
- I did ask her out once though.
- Sounds like the beginning to a heartfelt story.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.961
- I'm gonna pass, thanks.
- It was the first day of freshman year.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.544
and you thought everything was gonna be
different for you in high school, but she said no.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.046
Yeah.
Yeah, she even laughed.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.595
Told me to come back when the bike I rode
to school had an engine, not a chain.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.093
Mmm, unrequited love's a bitch.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.929
Maybe you should write about it
in English class, you know?

14:55.103 --> 14:57.094
Channel all that negative energy.

14:57.314 --> 15:01.398
Nah, I was thinking
I'd channel it into killing her.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.602
I'm not very good at writing.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.317
And switch.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.913
If you're trying to test
my patience, Mr. Stilinski,

15:16.083 --> 15:18.415
I guarantee it'll be a failing grade.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.506
What are you gonna do to her?

15:27.719 --> 15:31.462
Don't you think the better question is:
What's she going to do to us?

15:43.402 --> 15:45.142
l have to say,

15:46.029 --> 15:47.690
you guys are cute together.

15:49.157 --> 15:53.070
But you know,
I've always had this feeling like...

15:53.245 --> 15:55.031
I'm a little psychic.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.539
| just don't think you're going to last.

16:00.877 --> 16:05.086
You think you can hurt me by
sliding your hand up his thigh?

16:06.383 --> 16:08.715
Would you like it better
if it were your thigh?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.928
Come on.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.881
Girl fight in lab.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.887
It'll be hot.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.434
Time.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.887
If you've catalyzed
the reaction correctly,

16:22.107 --> 16:24.439
you should now be
looking at a crystal.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.897
Now,

16:32.117 --> 16:35.405
for the part of that last experiment
I'm sure you'll all enjoy...

16:35.662 --> 16:37.448
You can eat it.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.558
Lydia!

17:02.272 --> 17:03.512
What?

17:10.155 --> 17:11.691
Nothing.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.801
Derek's outside
waiting for Lydia.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.012
- Waiting to kill her?
- If he thinks she's the Kanima, then yes.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.268
- Especially after what happened at the pool.
- It's not her.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.558
Stiles, she didn't pass the test, man.
Nothing happened.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.188
No, it can't be her.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.730
It doesn't matter,
because Derek thinks it's her.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.988
So either we can convince him
that he's wrong,

17:59.204 --> 18:01.661
or we've got to figure out
a way to protect her.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.909
Well, I really don't think he's
gonna do anything here, not at school.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.116
What about after school?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.124
What if we can prove
that Derek's wrong?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.550
- By 3:00?
- There could be something in the bestiary.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.049
Oh, you mean the 900-page book
written in archaic Latin

18:15.220 --> 18:17.632
that none of us can read?
Good luck with that.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.757
Actually, I think I know someone
who might be able to translate it.

18:21.977 --> 18:25.390
I can talk to Derek,

18:25.605 --> 18:29.223
maybe convince him to give us a
chance to prove that it's not her.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.483
But if anything happens,
you guys let me handle it, okay?

18:32.696 --> 18:35.403
- What does that mean?
- It means you can't heal like I do.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.818
| just don't want you getting hurt.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.540
I can protect myself.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.169
What?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.673
Did something else happen?

19:04.185 --> 19:07.097
| just don't want you getting hurt.

19:07.314 --> 19:11.148
Seriously, if anything goes wrong,
you call me, okay?

19:11.943 --> 19:13.899
I don't care if
your dad finds out.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.103
Call, text, scream,
yell, whatever.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.531
I'll hear you and I'll
find you as fast as I can.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.735
We have until 3:00.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.417
Sorry.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.753
It's a sensitive trigger on that.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.888
Butterfly.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.425
Butterfly.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.102
Butterfly.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.430
Butterfly.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.186
Butterfly.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.075
Lydia?

20:02.661 --> 20:04.401
Danaus plexippus.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.829
Which is the scientific name for...

20:09.668 --> 20:10.953
Butterfly.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.462
Lydia, what's it gonna take
to get you to open up?

20:20.387 --> 20:21.877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.797
I am as honest and open
as a person can be.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.721
I would've said wolf.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.061
So who do you know that
can get into your house?

20:39.239 --> 20:41.230
What do you mean?
Like, break in?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.491
Or someone who has a key.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.661
Who also knows how to edit out
two hours of footage out of a tape

20:47.872 --> 20:50.158
- and knows how to loop it.
- I could do it.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.370
| write my own software, and I know your
mom forgets to lock the kitchen door.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.544
I could've done it too,
considering it's my camera.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.168
Actually, we could've
done it together.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.256
All right, I gotta go to
my next class, but, uh,

21:04.472 --> 21:05.882
I'll be back later to help
if you guys want it.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.680
Definitely.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.646
- What?
- Got a little crush going on there?

21:14.858 --> 21:17.349
- No. Shut up!
- Mm.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.360
- It doesn't matter anyway.
- Why's that?

21:20.572 --> 21:24.611
Because if you haven't noticed,
he's completely obsessed with Allison.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.737
So... Whatever.

21:27.537 --> 21:30.950
- Anyway, this is gonna take a couple of hours.
- So you can't tell me who did the editing?

21:31.124 --> 21:34.036
Is there anyone else you know
who can get into your house?

21:43.303 --> 21:44.634
Yeah.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.889
Actually, I do.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.632
Do you mind me asking
where you got this?

21:50.852 --> 21:54.185
- A book?
- Um, a family heirloom.

21:54.773 --> 21:56.604
Interesting family.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.024
I'm pretty familiar with most
romance languages,

22:00.236 --> 22:03.649
- but this is a little out of my reach.
- Can you give it a shot?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.489
All right, um...

22:07.702 --> 22:09.818
"Kanima..."

22:10.038 --> 22:11.198
Do l have that right?

22:11.539 --> 22:12.870
Yeah.

22:14.209 --> 22:20.580
"Like the wolf, its power is
greatest at the moon's peak."

22:21.966 --> 22:23.957
Sounds like a werewolf.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.129
Oh, there's some words
here I don't recognize.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.805
Just try.

22:30.975 --> 22:31.930
Please.

22:32.143 --> 22:35.476
- Could I hold onto it for a bit?
- Now is better, please.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.430
All right, um... Okay.

22:39.651 --> 22:44.441
"Like the wolf,
the Kanima is a social creature,

22:44.656 --> 22:47.147
but where the wolf seeks a pack,

22:47.367 --> 22:50.154
the Kanima seeks...

22:50.328 --> 22:51.864
a friend."

22:53.957 --> 22:56.243
"A friend."
What does that mean?

22:57.126 --> 22:58.662
Maybe it's lonely.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.835
Like a teenager.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.171
I want to talk to Derek.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.298
Talk to me.

23:09.514 --> 23:12.426
- I don't want to fight.
- Good.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.304
'Cause I'm twice the size of you.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.976
True.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.930
Really, really true.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.191
But you want to
know what I think?

23:28.700 --> 23:30.565
I'm twice as fast.

23:34.956 --> 23:36.821
She failed the test.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.078
Yeah, which doesn't prove anything.
Lydia's different.

23:40.253 --> 23:43.871
I know, at night she turns
into a homicidal walking snake.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.581
I'm not going to
let you kill her.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.923
Who said I was gonna do it?

24:18.041 --> 24:21.374
I don't know why you think
you have to protect everyone now, Scott,

24:21.711 --> 24:24.703
but even so, Lydia has killed people
and she's gonna do it again,

24:24.881 --> 24:26.246
and next time,
it's gonna be one of us.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.589
- What if you're wrong?
- She was bitten by an Alpha.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.213
- It's her.
- You saw that thing up close.

24:31.429 --> 24:35.263
- You know it's not like us.
- But it is! We're all shapeshifters.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.885
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.763
It happens rarely and
it happens for a reason.

24:39.938 --> 24:41.474
What reason?

24:41.689 --> 24:45.773
Sometimes the shape you take
reflects the person that you are.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.278
Even stiles calls
her cold-blooded.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.201
Well, what if she's immune?

24:58.873 --> 25:01.080
What if she's got something inside of her
that makes her immune to the bite,

25:01.292 --> 25:02.702
which is why
she didn't get paralyzed?

25:02.877 --> 25:06.244
No one's immune!
I've never seen it or heard of it.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.713
It's n... it's never happened.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.959
What about Jackson?

25:22.271 --> 25:24.398
- That is so bizarre.
- What?

25:25.483 --> 25:29.692
My camera's having some
sort of glitch/ meltdown.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.104
- It's lens flare.
- Yeah, but it's only happening on one player...

25:33.324 --> 25:34.609
McCall.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.157
That's why you tested him, isn't it?

25:36.369 --> 25:38.485
Because you gave him
what he wanted, didn't you?

25:38.663 --> 25:42.952
- Scott... - Peter said the bite
either kills you or turns you.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.783
You were probably hoping
that he would die.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.502
But nothing happened, right?

25:49.841 --> 25:52.457
And you have
no idea why, do you?

25:53.469 --> 25:55.050
No.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.345
Well, I have a theory.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.841
Lydia's immune, and somehow
she passed it on to Jackson.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.473
- You know I'm right.
- No!

26:05.356 --> 26:07.267
You cannot do this!

26:07.483 --> 26:09.439
Look, I can't let her live!

26:11.112 --> 26:12.977
You should have known that!

26:14.615 --> 26:18.403
l was hoping I would convince you,
but then...

26:20.204 --> 26:22.195
I wasn't counting on it.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.383
Where is she?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.937
If we're doing a study group,
why didn't we just stay in the library?

26:48.149 --> 26:50.105
Because we're meeting
up with somebody else.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.267
Why don't they just
meet us in the library?

26:52.487 --> 26:55.149
Oh, that would've been
a great idea. Too late.

26:55.364 --> 26:58.276
- Okay, hold on...
- Lydia, shut up and walk.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.361
McCall! Get over here!

27:08.336 --> 27:10.998
You know I'm gonna require
an explanation for this.

27:25.728 --> 27:29.141
You know there are certain responsibilities
to being a captain on the lacrosse team.

27:29.357 --> 27:31.143
- Co-captain.
- Okay, partial responsibilities.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.145
- Where did you find these?
- Under the bleachers,

27:33.319 --> 27:35.355
and you know somebody's
gonna have to pay for them.

27:35.571 --> 27:36.981
They're Danny's.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.688
Oh, great, mystery solved.

27:38.908 --> 27:41.365
Why don't you tell your buddy
Danny to take care of his equipment,

27:41.577 --> 27:43.829
or I'm gonna make you
take care of his equipment for him.

27:44.038 --> 27:47.997
Now, do you really want to be taking
care of Danny's equipment all the time?

27:48.709 --> 27:51.837
That depends. Are we still
talking about lacrosse pads?

27:55.133 --> 27:57.920
If we're studying at Scott's house,
then where's Scott?

27:58.136 --> 28:01.219
Meeting us here, I think.
lhope.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.718
- Thanks for doing this.
- I needed to talk to her anyway.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.568
Uh, there's been a few break-ins
around the neighborhood.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.002
And a murder.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.465
Yeah, it was bad.

28:44.599 --> 28:47.887
Lydia, follow me.
I need to talk to you for a minute.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.228
Seﬁouﬂy?
What is going on with everyone?

28:58.613 --> 28:59.853
Hey, McCall.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.731
Thanks.

29:23.304 --> 29:24.510
You okay?

29:30.770 --> 29:32.260
So...

29:34.815 --> 29:37.397
So you never
gave me back my key.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.188
What?

29:41.614 --> 29:42.854
Yourkey?

29:43.950 --> 29:47.442
- That's what you wanted to talk about?
- Why didn't you give it back?

29:48.079 --> 29:49.569
Are you kidding?

29:50.206 --> 29:52.663
I'm attacked by some
lunatic who bites me.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.867
A lunatic who, by the way,
still hasn't been caught.

29:56.045 --> 30:00.084
I spent two days freaked out of
my mind walking around the woods naked,

30:00.299 --> 30:03.132
all of my friends are
acting like total nutcases,

30:03.344 --> 30:07.132
and you expect me to be worried
about some stupid key?

30:07.348 --> 30:09.634
So do you have the key or not?

30:09.850 --> 30:11.386
Not.

30:26.701 --> 30:28.862
You just lied to me.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.171
Dude, what did
you do to my pads?

30:50.391 --> 30:52.507
Me? You're the one
who was wearing them.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.592
- No, I wasn't.
- What?

30:54.812 --> 30:56.643
l was in goal, remember?
Different pads.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.687
Then who was wearing these?

30:58.899 --> 31:01.151
Someone who owes
me a new set of pads.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.567
- It's me.
- What's wrong?

31:03.779 --> 31:05.610
You need to get here now.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.154
Right now.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.540
Okay, I'm leaving now.
On my way.

32:01.212 --> 32:04.124
Oh, jeez.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.300
- What are you doing?
- I think...

32:11.097 --> 32:13.088
I think I have to call my dad.

32:13.516 --> 32:16.258
- But if he finds you here... you and Scott...
- I know.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.637
But what are we supposed to do?

32:21.857 --> 32:26.271
They're not here to scare us, okay?
They're here to kill Lydia.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.320
Where's my key, Lydia?

32:39.959 --> 32:42.541
It was you, wasn't it?

32:44.588 --> 32:46.544
You edited the tape.

32:47.550 --> 32:50.166
- What tape?
- The night of the full moon.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.759
The recording.

32:52.972 --> 32:56.715
You came into my house, into my room,
and you saw what was happening to me,

32:56.934 --> 33:01.052
so you took the tape from the camera and
you edited out the most important part.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.437
I don't know why.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.567
Maybe because you wanted to
take that from me,

33:08.779 --> 33:12.647
my moment,
like you take everything.

33:16.245 --> 33:18.782
Or maybe you just thought
you were protecting me.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.577
But it was you, wasn't it?

33:25.713 --> 33:27.954
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.291
But if you need it so badly...

33:35.973 --> 33:37.474
Fine.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.789
I hate you.

34:11.133 --> 34:13.465
I hate you so much.

34:15.679 --> 34:16.964
No.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.094
No, you don't.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.937
I should.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.977
I should hate you.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.734
- Don't.
- Lydia.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.554
I got an idea.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.891
- Just shoot one of 'em.
- Are you serious?

35:05.104 --> 35:07.686
We told Scott we could
protect ourselves, so let's do it.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.763
Or at least give it a shot, right?

35:10.693 --> 35:11.978
Okay.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.892
Look, they don't think
we're gonna fight,

35:14.113 --> 35:16.946
so if one of them gets hit,
I guarantee they'll take off.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.148
So just shoot one of 'em.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.416
Which one?

35:27.167 --> 35:31.752
Uh... Derek. Yeah, shoot him,
preferably in the head.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.455
If Scott was able to catch
an arrow, Derek definitely can.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.916
Okay, uh, just shoot one
of the other three then.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.343
- You mean two.
- No, I mean three.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.638
Where the hell is Isaac?

36:06.498 --> 36:07.954
What was that?

36:25.768 --> 36:27.599
What's happening?

36:29.521 --> 36:30.647
Get back.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.518
Someone's trying to
break in, okay? Go.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.858
Lydia, go!

36:41.158 --> 36:42.694
Jackson?

36:58.175 --> 37:00.882
Hi, l-l need the police.

37:01.095 --> 37:02.551
Hurry! Please!

37:14.316 --> 37:17.274
Stiles, it's here!

37:36.505 --> 37:39.087
This might make me sound
like kind of a bitch,

37:40.217 --> 37:43.550
but I've always wondered what it feels like
to steal someone's boyfriend.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.514
I bet it's a pretty
sick rush of power.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.346
I think I might try it with Scott.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.563
You know what?

37:56.775 --> 37:59.187
I don't think it's gonna be that hard,

38:00.446 --> 38:05.065
because why would he be waiting
around to steal 10 minutes with you,

38:05.284 --> 38:08.151
when he can have me
anytime he wants.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.792
You didn't really think
that would work, did you?

38:19.298 --> 38:20.754
Actually I did.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.858
I thought you were a psychic...

38:52.956 --> 38:54.412
bitch!

39:33.705 --> 39:36.868
I think I'm finally getting
why you keep refusing me, Scott.

39:37.793 --> 39:42.127
You're not an Omega,
you're already an Alpha of your own pack.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.461
But you know you can't beat me.

39:47.678 --> 39:49.964
I can hold you off
until the cops get here.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.580
Get them out of here.

40:24.548 --> 40:28.507
Would someone please tell me
what the hell is going on?

40:29.511 --> 40:30.887
It's Jackson.
