00:07.021 --> 00:08.455
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:08.461 --> 00:09.661
<i> To the Soldier Sneaker line.</i>

00:09.722 --> 00:10.922
All ght.
The brand expansion

00:10.922 --> 00:13.122
that's gonna take DollaHyde
to the next level. Yes.

00:13.122 --> 00:14.922
I'll drink to that.
Sky's the limit, man.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.664
<i> Dad, we do have a problem.</i>

00:16.664 --> 00:19.064
You're calling me
and Lex a circus.

00:19.064 --> 00:20.797
Not putting all your eggs
in the Marty Kaan basket.

00:20.797 --> 00:21.964
That was smart.

00:21.964 --> 00:23.764
Marissa, I can get you the whole
McClintock Media Group.

00:23.764 --> 00:25.697
But you have to do exactly

00:25.629 --> 00:26.763
what I tell you to do.

00:26.763 --> 00:28.229
Listen, motherfucker.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.296
Me?
I killed your dog.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.063
What the fuck
you talking about, man?

00:32.063 --> 00:34.396
Lukas wanted me to let
you know he knows.

00:34.396 --> 00:35.429
He knows what?
About how you and Dre

00:35.429 --> 00:37.363
are trying to push him out his own company.
Jesus, come on, listen.

00:37.363 --> 00:38.329
Uh-huh, that's right.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.829
<i> Dre intends to move on</i>

00:39.829 --> 00:41.929
<i>without me, doesn't he?</i>

00:41.929 --> 00:43.896
<i>At least,</i>
<i>that's the plan, right?</i>

00:49.699 --> 00:51.299
<i> I'm gonna get out of this!</i>

00:51.359 --> 00:52.993
<i> Is that all you got,</i>
<i> little man?</i>

00:54.749 --> 00:57.216
Come on, pretty boy,
you got more than that.

01:00.483 --> 01:01.616
Okay.
Okay.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.953
All right, you have
five minutes to change, okay?

01:03.953 --> 01:06.120
And don't bullshit me
'cause I will leave without you.

01:06.188 --> 01:07.255
I like this outfit.

01:07.308 --> 01:08.641
No. No, you don't.

01:08.641 --> 01:10.441
Aw, God.

01:11.841 --> 01:13.274
Can I help you?

01:13.384 --> 01:16.351
Apparently not.

01:16.351 --> 01:18.784
Four minutes, 19 seconds.

01:18.784 --> 01:20.851
Going.

01:22.451 --> 01:24.318
The kid's amazing, Marty.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.451
Uh-huh.
He's, like, the nicest guy ever.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.251
The fuck is this?

01:34.251 --> 01:36.984
Uh, that's about to
be your last meal.

01:36.984 --> 01:38.051
No Cheetos?

01:39.351 --> 01:41.618
Dude, if I had millions of dollars,
I'd have all kinds of Cheetos.

01:41.618 --> 01:43.718
Yeah, that's why you don't have
millions of dollars.

01:43.718 --> 01:45.184
Hey. Fly?

01:45.184 --> 01:46.784
Nice.

01:46.784 --> 01:47.784
Hey, check this out.

01:47.784 --> 01:49.584
Turn around.

01:49.584 --> 01:51.984
Hey, Roscoe?

01:51.984 --> 01:53.218
Can I talk to you around
the corner for a second, buddy?

01:57.584 --> 01:59.618
Strike two.

02:02.518 --> 02:03.984
What is going on, man?

02:03.984 --> 02:06.118
You've been dressing your own self
since you were 18 months old.

02:06.118 --> 02:06.951
So what?

02:06.951 --> 02:08.684
So why are you taking
fashion advice

02:08.684 --> 02:10.217
from <i> Boys Don't Cry</i> in there?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.918
Because he's my girlfriend.

02:11.918 --> 02:12.851
Oh.

02:12.851 --> 02:14.251
What, Dad?!
Roscoe.

02:14.251 --> 02:15.518
What?
Listen.

02:15.518 --> 02:16.851
You have always been the kid

02:16.851 --> 02:18.384
who's made good choices, okay?

02:18.384 --> 02:19.851
She's not worth you losing that.

02:19.851 --> 02:22.318
<i>She's</i> not. What?
Because you said she's not.

02:22.318 --> 02:25.484
I think <i> he's</i> the first person
who's ever really gotten me.

02:25.484 --> 02:26.851
Really?

02:26.851 --> 02:28.951
'Cause I think
I get you, Roscoe.

02:28.951 --> 02:30.118
I know you.

02:30.118 --> 02:32.251
And you are losing
yourself to this thing.

02:32.251 --> 02:34.484
Oh, so first Lex and I were
just a circus.

02:34.484 --> 02:36.584
And now
we're a thing.

02:36.584 --> 02:38.418
Good to know.

02:38.418 --> 02:39.884
You know, Dad,
you've never asked me once

02:39.884 --> 02:42.218
what I think
about <i> my</i> relationship.

02:42.218 --> 02:44.984
What do you think
of your relationship, Roscoe?

02:44.984 --> 02:47.151
Huh? Okay?

02:47.151 --> 02:48.751
Because I think
Lex found herself

02:48.751 --> 02:51.518
a good kid and decided to drag
him down to her level.

02:51.518 --> 02:53.518
Now, you can ignore me if that
makes you feel like a man

02:53.518 --> 02:55.951
or whatever, but don't come
crying to me when this thing

02:55.951 --> 02:57.684
blows up in your face.
Don't worry, Dad.

02:57.684 --> 03:00.184
I won't 'cause you won't
even be here anyway.

03:01.351 --> 03:03.484
She's at the door, smart-ass.

03:08.118 --> 03:10.084
Let's go.

03:18.118 --> 03:20.718
<i> Lukas knows the deal, okay?</i>

03:20.718 --> 03:23.184
So we can just put
all our cards on the table.

03:23.184 --> 03:25.718
No more asking, man.
No more plotting.

03:25.718 --> 03:27.651
We just force his ass out.
Guns blazing.

03:27.651 --> 03:29.151
Marty, listen to me.
I'm telling you.

03:29.151 --> 03:30.918
It's gonna be
a beautiful fucking day

03:30.918 --> 03:32.951
once DollaHyde finally
reaches its potential.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.151
Uh, Dre, there's
something happening...

03:35.151 --> 03:36.184
What?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.118
What the fuck?

03:39.118 --> 03:41.351
Lukas said we could take
whatever we want.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.718
Oh, hell no!

03:42.718 --> 03:43.784
Give me an hour.

03:43.784 --> 03:45.051
Hey, what are you guys doing?!

03:45.051 --> 03:46.551
Where are you going
with those boxes?

03:46.551 --> 03:48.551
Nigga, where's you going
with my tree?

03:49.918 --> 03:51.084
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

03:51.084 --> 03:53.251
This is like Anatevka at the end
of <i> Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

03:53.251 --> 03:55.218
I swear to God, Doug,
if you start singing,

03:55.218 --> 03:56.651
I will kick you in
the fucking taint.

03:56.651 --> 03:57.951
That's unnecessary.

03:57.951 --> 03:59.418
All right, kiddies,
listen up.

03:59.418 --> 04:01.551
Little kiddies,
spread out.

04:01.551 --> 04:03.518
See if you can identify
anyone who might

04:03.518 --> 04:05.951
come back in here tomorrow
with a high-capacity magazine.

04:05.951 --> 04:07.284
Go.
Is that possible?

04:07.284 --> 04:08.351
Big kiddies,

04:08.351 --> 04:10.351
suck it the fuck up, okay?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.084
This is the job.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.251
We're gonna turn
this shit around.

04:13.251 --> 04:15.618
Okay, and let's remember,
even if we don't, one of us

04:15.618 --> 04:17.317
is bringing in the sixth largest

04:17.317 --> 04:19.084
media conglomerate
in the world.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.017
Bringing! Not brought.

04:21.017 --> 04:22.684
Until you can say "brought," you
need to give it a rest, Clyde.

04:22.684 --> 04:24.384
Yeah. Jesus, okay.
Consider me resting.

04:24.384 --> 04:25.918
Resting my ass on your lips...

04:25.918 --> 04:28.718
Marty!
...when I close McClintock!

04:28.718 --> 04:29.784
Get that shit out my way.

04:29.784 --> 04:31.384
Marty!

04:31.384 --> 04:33.851
I just got a text from
that motherfucker Lukas.

04:33.851 --> 04:35.284
He says and I quote,

04:35.284 --> 04:37.218
"I would love to
attend the meeting,

04:37.218 --> 04:39.851
"but due to recent tragic
events, I'll be at home

04:39.851 --> 04:41.951
interviewing
Chihuahua breeders."

04:43.618 --> 04:45.384
Oh, no.

04:45.384 --> 04:47.451
Okay, I'm almost positive
that dog was jaundiced.

04:47.451 --> 04:49.384
Probably diabetic. Listen, I got
to get the fuck out of here

04:49.384 --> 04:50.984
or I'm gonna lose
my goddamn mind! I hear you.

04:50.984 --> 04:52.951
You see this fucking place?
Let's go to my office.

04:52.951 --> 04:54.618
What was a dog doing
at a club anyway? Is that how you...

04:54.618 --> 04:56.851
If I didn't kill him,
the secondhand smoke would've.

04:58.351 --> 05:00.251
At the end of the day, Lukas is
just hurting himself, okay?

05:00.251 --> 05:02.151
We can launch
a pro forma death march.

05:02.151 --> 05:04.918
Wrap Lukas in so much red tape
that he chokes on his own vomit.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.151
So creepy.

05:06.151 --> 05:07.851
And of course we'll run
a multivariate test

05:07.851 --> 05:09.818
to optimize outcomes. Boom!

05:09.818 --> 05:10.784
Don't do that boom, no.
No?

05:10.784 --> 05:11.851
Listen, whatever
Lukas's move,

05:11.851 --> 05:13.551
we can counter.
The IPO could

05:13.551 --> 05:14.851
realistically
land near-term.

05:14.851 --> 05:16.051
Why don't we sit down
with your CFO?

05:16.051 --> 05:17.618
And we put some numbers
on the damage?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.018
We know exactly where we stand.
You know, I'd really love that.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.751
But Lukas got
rid of him first.

05:20.751 --> 05:21.984
Am I missing something?

05:21.984 --> 05:23.451
Can't you just hire back
the people he's fired?

05:23.451 --> 05:25.251
And pay them with what?

05:25.251 --> 05:27.151
There's a double
signatory required

05:27.151 --> 05:28.118
on all outgoing checks.

05:28.118 --> 05:29.584
Dre, our end state vision

05:29.584 --> 05:31.284
for DollaHyde remains...

05:31.284 --> 05:32.318
Aw, fuck me!

05:32.318 --> 05:33.951
Jeannie.

05:33.951 --> 05:37.151
Marty, this shit
got me shook, man.

05:37.151 --> 05:39.351
Lukas already fired
half the senior staff.

05:39.351 --> 05:41.151
He shut down production,
canceled orders,

05:41.151 --> 05:43.451
and stopped payments.

05:43.451 --> 05:45.218
Now, look, I'm doing
everything I can

05:45.218 --> 05:46.484
in terms of damage control,

05:46.484 --> 05:47.584
but there's not gonna be
a goddamn DollaHyde

05:47.584 --> 05:49.684
unless y'all fix
this shit, stat!

05:49.684 --> 05:52.151
Dre? I understand
that you are upset, okay?

05:52.151 --> 05:54.684
Oh, he understands I'm pissed.
And this is very...

05:54.684 --> 05:55.718
Look, walk with me, okay?

05:55.718 --> 05:57.718
Look, I got shit
to do, all right?

05:57.718 --> 05:59.684
Dre, just walk with me.

06:01.384 --> 06:03.151
Look, the more time
you spend panicking,

06:03.151 --> 06:04.684
the less time we
have to do our jobs.

06:04.684 --> 06:06.684
Fuck, Marty, all right?
This was my life.

06:06.684 --> 06:08.451
And this motherfucker
is winning the war.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.118
No, he's not. He's winning
a tiny little battle, okay?

06:11.118 --> 06:12.884
He's acting like a baby
having a tantrum in his crib.

06:12.884 --> 06:15.051
Yeah, but I look around and my
whole kingdom is coming apart.

06:15.051 --> 06:16.618
It's a flesh wound, Dre.

06:16.618 --> 06:17.818
Flesh wound.

06:17.818 --> 06:19.151
Sit down.

06:19.151 --> 06:21.151
Come on, sit down.

06:21.151 --> 06:22.484
Fuck.

06:22.484 --> 06:23.718
Listen to me.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.884
I have reached in and pulled
the beating hearts

06:25.884 --> 06:28.884
out of far scarier motherfuckers
than Lukas Frye, believe me.

06:30.184 --> 06:31.718
Goddamn.

06:31.718 --> 06:34.184
I'm telling you, you're gonna
run the world one of these days.

06:34.184 --> 06:35.551
I already do.

06:35.551 --> 06:37.151
Look around.

06:37.151 --> 06:38.984
Listen.

06:38.984 --> 06:41.884
Lukas loves money a lot
more than he hates you.

06:41.884 --> 06:43.351
This is true.

06:44.918 --> 06:47.118
All right, I see you got a play.

06:47.118 --> 06:48.784
Always.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.118
Have a Red Vine.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.851
They're fat free.

06:51.851 --> 06:54.584
<i> Until Lukas co-signs</i>
<i> on these payments again,</i>

06:54.584 --> 06:56.251
this is volunteer work.

06:56.251 --> 06:58.884
I think you know how I feel
about volunteer work.

06:58.884 --> 07:00.584
Yeah, she hates it.
She hates it all.

07:00.584 --> 07:01.584
It's true.
Yeah.

07:01.584 --> 07:04.818
She know she once sued Habitat
for Humanity to keep poor people

07:04.818 --> 07:06.051
out of her neighborhood.
It's true.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.051
Fuck off, I did not.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.651
But if we don't do
something soon,

07:08.651 --> 07:10.484
I'm gonna be poor people.

07:10.484 --> 07:12.684
On a related note,
the McClintock family

07:12.684 --> 07:14.384
could not be less poor.

07:14.384 --> 07:17.284
I'm not sure you understand
"related notes."

07:17.284 --> 07:19.418
Don't laugh.

07:19.418 --> 07:21.084
That's not worth laughing at,
and I don't think you understand

07:21.084 --> 07:22.751
the McClintock...
Shut the fuck up, Clyde!

07:22.751 --> 07:23.684
For real?

07:23.684 --> 07:25.418
Yeah, kind of burns a little

07:25.418 --> 07:26.551
on the way down
doesn't it?

07:26.551 --> 07:27.818
Hey, is it cool

07:27.818 --> 07:29.718
if we get to work
or does Dre need another hug?

07:29.718 --> 07:30.918
Lukas will not
be coming to us,

07:30.918 --> 07:33.418
so we are going to go to Lukas.

07:33.418 --> 07:34.984
Jeffrey, Caitlin, set that up.

07:34.984 --> 07:36.284
Together?

07:36.284 --> 07:37.218
Happy to.

07:37.218 --> 07:38.318
Yeah, we're closing this buyout

07:38.318 --> 07:40.518
today.

07:40.518 --> 07:41.384
Done like dinner.

07:41.384 --> 07:42.884
Why?

07:42.884 --> 07:45.184
Um, because Dre is our client.

07:45.184 --> 07:46.684
He paid us money, so
he gets what he wants.

07:46.684 --> 07:48.184
That's how it works, Jeannie.

07:48.184 --> 07:50.918
Ooh, quick trip back to reality.

07:50.918 --> 07:52.084
The company is our client.

07:52.084 --> 07:53.484
The company paid us money.

07:53.484 --> 07:54.551
The company in which

07:54.551 --> 07:56.018
Lukas and Dre
are equal partners.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.351
Wow.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.118
For a second there I thought
you weren't gonna figure out

07:59.118 --> 08:01.718
a way to make
this whole giant clusterfuck

08:01.718 --> 08:02.884
about your hurt feelings.

08:02.884 --> 08:05.551
Instead of rubbing our palms
together and thinking of new

08:05.551 --> 08:08.051
and inventive ways
we could fuck Lukas over,

08:08.051 --> 08:09.618
I think what we should
be asking ourselves

08:09.618 --> 08:11.684
is who does
the company need more?

08:11.684 --> 08:12.884
Doug?

08:12.884 --> 08:14.518
Doug?
Doug.

08:14.518 --> 08:15.551
Doug! He's not gonna like...
Doug!

08:15.551 --> 08:16.551
Okay, yeah.

08:16.551 --> 08:18.318
At-at Jeannie's request, okay,

08:18.318 --> 08:19.584
I drafted two

08:19.584 --> 08:21.151
models showing

08:21.151 --> 08:23.484
the five-year projections
of DollaHyde's viability.

08:23.484 --> 08:25.151
One with Dre at the helm
and Lukas out.

08:25.151 --> 08:26.318
And the other reversed.

08:26.318 --> 08:28.151
Ooh!

08:28.151 --> 08:30.118
Uh, the numbers are
comparable, Marty.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.518
Oh, my God, are they
also comparable, Will?

08:31.518 --> 08:32.984
If there is no clear

08:32.984 --> 08:35.484
financial advantage
to forcing Lukas out,

08:35.484 --> 08:36.918
why should we
spend time on it?

08:36.918 --> 08:39.650
When we go to Lukas today,
our goal should be

08:39.650 --> 08:41.650
to get him back in the business,
just under different terms.

08:41.650 --> 08:42.818
A big part
of their brand appeal is

08:42.818 --> 08:44.251
the whole
"best friends get rich" story.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.951
People eat that shit up, Marty.

08:45.951 --> 08:48.351
Okay, let the record show that
all the kiddies have been heard.

08:48.351 --> 08:49.584
However.

08:49.584 --> 08:51.984
However, Lukas is precisely

08:51.984 --> 08:53.118
the kind of liability

08:53.118 --> 08:54.818
that you don't need
haunting the halls

08:54.818 --> 08:57.151
when the distributors go digging
through your financials.

08:57.151 --> 08:58.418
That's one key piece

08:58.418 --> 09:00.451
that you left out
of your sound analysis, Jeannie.

09:00.451 --> 09:02.251
Well, technically, it was
my sound analysis...

09:02.251 --> 09:04.384
Do I look like I give
a fuck, Doug?

09:05.551 --> 09:07.718
We have one job:
Lukas has got to go.

09:07.718 --> 09:08.951
You on board
with that?

09:08.951 --> 09:10.618
Just as a wrap-up,
though:

09:10.618 --> 09:12.251
I did have the better
of the two plays,

09:12.251 --> 09:13.918
but because you
have veto power,

09:13.918 --> 09:15.384
we're gonna
toss mine?

09:15.384 --> 09:16.818
Cool, that sounds great.
I'm on board.

09:16.818 --> 09:19.018
Thank you for the support.

09:19.018 --> 09:20.484
Jeannie Beannie,
William, Doug,

09:20.484 --> 09:21.651
you're coming with me.

09:21.651 --> 09:23.518
No.
Jeannie Bean, Clyde, Doug,

09:23.518 --> 09:25.551
can go with you.
I need Will on the journeyline.

09:25.551 --> 09:26.684
Doesn't Clyde have

09:26.684 --> 09:28.851
an imaginary girlfriend's account
that he needs to be working on?

09:28.851 --> 09:31.018
In two weeks,
the McClintock media empire

09:31.018 --> 09:32.318
will be jizzing money

09:32.318 --> 09:34.218
into this office.
Ew.

09:34.218 --> 09:36.284
Yeah. No father figure at home.
That's what happens.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.918
Ooh...

09:38.918 --> 09:40.151
Would you look
at that?

09:40.151 --> 09:41.984
Ah, he's chipper.

09:41.984 --> 09:43.418
- Of course he is.
- It's dick math.

09:43.418 --> 09:44.418
Dick math?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.018
Mm-hmm. We tried
to dick Lukas over,

09:46.018 --> 09:48.084
which was, admittedly,
a dick move.

09:48.084 --> 09:49.951
And now he's dicking us over

09:49.951 --> 09:52.118
by proving that he can waste
our time and money.

09:52.118 --> 09:54.384
So we have to come
to his house,

09:54.384 --> 09:55.451
hat in hand,
begging.

09:55.451 --> 09:56.718
That's right.

09:56.718 --> 09:58.118
Which, in his mind,
proves that he is the dick

09:58.118 --> 09:59.951
with the biggest dick of all

09:59.951 --> 10:00.984
and we are just...

10:00.984 --> 10:01.918
Pussies.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.084
Ta-da!

10:06.018 --> 10:08.118
Lukas Frye suffers from

10:08.118 --> 10:10.984
a socioeconomic disease
known as...

10:15.184 --> 10:17.784
...hood rich.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.351
Now, this condition
presents itself in many ways,

10:20.351 --> 10:22.118
but there are
a few common symptoms

10:22.118 --> 10:23.684
which indicate you are
in the presence

10:23.684 --> 10:25.051
of someone with full blown

10:25.051 --> 10:27.084
I-never-really-got-out-
of-the-ghetto-itis.

10:28.684 --> 10:30.684
More cars than novels.

10:32.318 --> 10:34.284
Ah!

10:39.951 --> 10:41.984
Disapproving white neighbors.

10:44.084 --> 10:46.051
And gold.

10:46.884 --> 10:49.551
Now, I am no psychic,

10:49.551 --> 10:50.884
but I'm willing to bet

10:50.884 --> 10:53.851
this fucking monstrosity
is lousy with the crap.

10:54.751 --> 10:56.118
Now, unfortunately,

10:56.118 --> 11:00.251
there is no known cure
for hood rich...

11:00.251 --> 11:02.251
so we all gots to suffer.

11:06.384 --> 11:07.551
Come on...
what the fuck?

11:07.551 --> 11:08.918
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. My bad.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.951
Hey, Lukas!

11:09.951 --> 11:11.684
Hi. Doug Guggenheim.

11:11.684 --> 11:13.884
Ah, fuck youggenheim.

11:15.318 --> 11:17.451
Aw, shit, y'all.

11:17.451 --> 11:21.218
If it ain't Marty Kaan
and Associates in this bitch.

11:21.218 --> 11:22.451
What's up, niggas?

11:22.451 --> 11:23.418
Oh, God, wait.

11:23.418 --> 11:24.818
So if I respond,
is it the same

11:24.818 --> 11:26.684
as if I actually said...
Don't overthink it.

11:26.684 --> 11:28.818
Lukas, thank you for seeing us.
I know you got a lot going on.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.218
Nah, man, I ain't
got nothing going on.

11:30.218 --> 11:31.218
We ain't doing
nothing but chillin'

11:31.218 --> 11:32.418
like a motherfucker
in this bitch.

11:32.418 --> 11:33.651
What's happening,
boss lady?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.951
Oh, um, this house
is really beautiful.

11:35.951 --> 11:37.084
The artwork's
great.

11:37.084 --> 11:38.284
Yeah, thank you.
That's some cheap shit I got

11:38.284 --> 11:39.484
from the Michael
Jackson auction.

11:39.484 --> 11:40.984
Seconds after, you
wouldn't believe it.

11:40.984 --> 11:42.018
Seconds after
he died?

11:42.018 --> 11:44.251
Hey, man, I said seconds after.
That's all I said.

11:44.251 --> 11:45.351
You talk
a lot, huh?

11:45.351 --> 11:46.918
It's a great crip.
Crib. Buh.

11:46.918 --> 11:50.584
The theme of this room is, uh,
Biblical Bullshit, man.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.751
If Jesus were to have
his last supper today,

11:52.751 --> 11:54.251
he would sit at this
motherfucking table.

11:54.251 --> 11:55.951
I could seat a small village

11:55.951 --> 11:58.184
or a large project,
whichever I choose.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.718
Hello, Miss Lady.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.084
This is, uh,
Moroccan tile right here.

12:02.084 --> 12:03.718
These are stone pillars.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.418
They came from...
they came from Rome,

12:05.418 --> 12:06.884
just like in
the Coliseum and shit.

12:06.884 --> 12:09.351
These are my panthers,
this is my pool,

12:09.351 --> 12:11.851
these are my bitches.

12:11.851 --> 12:13.918
You walked right past
my Trevi Fountain.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.118
Ta-da!

12:16.118 --> 12:17.584
Catfish pond, bitches.

12:17.584 --> 12:18.784
Would you look at that?
Oh ho!

12:18.784 --> 12:20.318
I mean, real live catfish

12:20.318 --> 12:22.751
imported from Savannah
Sweetwater Creek.

12:22.751 --> 12:24.418
Now, what nigga
you know living

12:24.418 --> 12:25.718
like that?

12:25.718 --> 12:28.018
Honestly?
Not a one.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.151
Ah!
Ah!

12:30.118 --> 12:31.284
Hood rich.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.251
Nihito Arakawa....

12:33.251 --> 12:34.251
Listen.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.418
Dre fucked up, Lukas.
Okay?

12:35.418 --> 12:36.584
We fucked up.

12:36.584 --> 12:38.351
We know we fucked up.
But the bottom line is,

12:38.351 --> 12:40.918
neither one of you can really
make a move without the other.

12:40.918 --> 12:42.984
Now, Lukas, uh,
we can assure you

12:42.984 --> 12:45.584
that the buy-out price
is well above

12:45.584 --> 12:46.984
actual market value
of your shares.

12:46.984 --> 12:48.151
You will walk away

12:48.151 --> 12:50.684
with a hell of a lot more
than you have right now.

12:50.684 --> 12:52.184
Just sayin', man.

12:52.184 --> 12:54.418
All that extra cash floating
around, you could finally start up

12:54.418 --> 12:55.684
that sneaker line
of yours.

12:55.684 --> 12:57.418
Hey...
What do you say?

12:57.418 --> 12:59.018
I'm liking this guy already.
He's growing on me.

12:59.018 --> 13:00.951
He's telling me
that I can take

13:00.951 --> 13:01.884
money that I make

13:01.884 --> 13:04.784
and use it to buy things.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.018
That shit's going
in my diary tonight.

13:07.018 --> 13:07.984
Nice.

13:07.984 --> 13:09.251
We don't want
to overwhelm him

13:09.251 --> 13:10.851
with too many good ideas.
Got it.

13:10.851 --> 13:12.651
Man, you brought this
Ivy League Ashkenazi

13:12.651 --> 13:14.051
all the way
over here,

13:14.051 --> 13:15.584
and that's the best
financial advice he got?

13:15.584 --> 13:16.951
- Hey, yo, Lukas.
Mm-hmm?

13:16.951 --> 13:17.884
Man, the Jews is fallin' off.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.484
Hey, man.
Inappropriate.

13:19.484 --> 13:20.918
Every goddamn time.

13:20.918 --> 13:23.084
Rachel Cohen broke his heart

13:23.084 --> 13:24.918
in middle school
and he's still bitter.

13:24.918 --> 13:26.284
Oh.

13:26.284 --> 13:27.418
Don't take that Jewish
shit personal.

13:27.418 --> 13:28.384
You ign'ant.

13:28.384 --> 13:29.484
Man, shut the fuck up.

13:29.484 --> 13:30.984
Thank you, Vernon.
Thank you for having my back.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.851
Nigga, I'm Vernon.
That's Foxx.

13:32.851 --> 13:33.884
And thank you,
Foxx.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.084
So what are you thinking?

13:35.084 --> 13:36.951
I'm thinking Dre must be
extremely desperate.

13:36.951 --> 13:38.884
But I'm not accepting
his welfare, no thank you.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.851
You have two
options, okay?

13:40.851 --> 13:43.218
You can sell
your part...

13:43.218 --> 13:45.218
Oh, no,
I'm intrigued.

13:45.218 --> 13:46.151
Please, continue.

13:46.151 --> 13:47.451
You can sell your
part of the business...

13:47.451 --> 13:49.618
Mm-hmm.
...and live like a fucking god,

13:49.618 --> 13:51.218
or you can just sit on your ass

13:51.218 --> 13:52.651
while the whole thing
burns down to the ground,

13:52.651 --> 13:54.984
at which point you're
gonna make, you know,

13:54.984 --> 13:56.551
50% of not-a-fucking...

13:56.551 --> 13:57.784
What is this?

13:57.784 --> 13:59.184
Lukas, do you want to stay
mad or do you want to stay...

13:59.184 --> 14:00.684
rich?

14:00.684 --> 14:02.184
You see, I already know

14:02.184 --> 14:03.384
how they
look on me.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.751
I choose based on

14:04.751 --> 14:06.451
how I think they will look

14:06.451 --> 14:08.251
in the morning.
Smart.

14:08.251 --> 14:09.984
That's fabulous.
Okay, we're out of here, guys.

14:09.984 --> 14:12.484
Uh, homies, hoes...
it's been real.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.318
Excuse me, Lukas. How you gonna
disrespect my homies like that.

14:17.551 --> 14:18.751
Hey, man.

14:18.751 --> 14:19.884
Come on, man, y'all bring

14:19.884 --> 14:22.051
your motherfucking asses back.

14:22.051 --> 14:25.484
You suburban-ass niggas,
y'all quit all easy and shit.

14:25.484 --> 14:27.251
Probably 'cause you ain't
never had to work for nothing.

14:27.251 --> 14:29.284
Had everything given
to you all your life.

14:29.284 --> 14:32.084
Oh. But I see 50 mil.

14:32.084 --> 14:35.218
Ol' boy came with it.

14:35.218 --> 14:38.518
Yeah. Suburban-ass niggas
write big boy checks.

14:38.518 --> 14:40.518
Okay. So can we
close this deal?

14:40.518 --> 14:43.118
Or do you have some more
naked women coming by to, uh,

14:43.118 --> 14:45.051
model your gold chain
wear for the evening?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.018
I was hoping for at least one.

14:47.018 --> 14:49.718
You look awfully nice today.

14:49.718 --> 14:52.318
I look nice every day.
That's irrelevant.

14:52.318 --> 14:53.818
I guess.

14:53.818 --> 14:55.451
- I'll pass.
- Doug.

14:55.451 --> 14:57.384
I get it.

14:57.384 --> 14:59.484
We fucked up so you don't want
to play ball.

14:59.484 --> 15:00.684
The fuck
is that?

15:00.684 --> 15:03.218
Oh. That's the DollaHyde
financial report.

15:03.218 --> 15:04.518
The real one.

15:04.518 --> 15:06.584
The one that can get
you thrown right back in prison.

15:06.584 --> 15:09.451
If I go down, Dre goes down with me.
That's great.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.251
You two can be cellmates.
Prison for a nigga like me, man,

15:12.251 --> 15:13.484
- like a family reunion.
- True.

15:13.484 --> 15:15.451
Keith over there at
Lompoc right now.

15:15.451 --> 15:16.751
And G and them
in Atwater.

15:16.751 --> 15:18.484
Shit. Atwater got
ice cream sandwiches.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.751
What?
Mint chocolate chip?

15:19.751 --> 15:21.084
They got Neapolitan.
Goddamn.

15:21.084 --> 15:22.884
Damn, sign me up.
Marty, take me now.

15:22.884 --> 15:25.018
There's a prison down the street.
They break for lunch early.

15:25.018 --> 15:26.951
You're psyched about that? You would go
to prison Psyched? I didn't know that.

15:26.951 --> 15:28.084
- for ice cream?
- Oh, no. Okay.

15:28.084 --> 15:29.451
I get it.
You don't need the money,

15:29.451 --> 15:31.718
and jail equals
ice cream sandwiches.

15:31.718 --> 15:33.451
But I'm willing to bet
that you have some associates

15:33.451 --> 15:35.984
in the drug game
that would find no humor at all

15:35.984 --> 15:38.384
in the fact that you outed them
to the Feds.

15:38.384 --> 15:41.018
I fittin' to out nobody.
Oh, no. You will.

15:41.018 --> 15:43.151
'Cause I'm gonna do it.
And you paid me.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.884
So, in essence, you outed them.

15:45.884 --> 15:48.118
I don't think that's something
you want to go doin' there,

15:48.118 --> 15:51.084
Mr. Marty Kaan of Lower Grand Street.
If you could just

15:51.084 --> 15:53.518
pull your head out
of this ratchet rap video

15:53.518 --> 15:54.551
for ten seconds,

15:54.551 --> 15:57.251
you would understand
the degree to which

15:57.251 --> 15:59.651
your threats have no
fucking effect on me.

15:59.651 --> 16:02.184
Now, what the fuck
you need to do

16:02.184 --> 16:04.818
is recognize the motherfucker
you dealin' with.

16:04.818 --> 16:07.451
I've seen you bitch Dre out
on several occasions,

16:07.451 --> 16:09.184
and he allows you
to do it.

16:09.184 --> 16:10.684
What you need
to see right now

16:10.684 --> 16:12.418
is you dealin'
with a real gangster,

16:12.418 --> 16:14.218
not the shit
you see on TV.

16:14.218 --> 16:16.318
I don't give a fuck
if you send a SWAT team

16:16.318 --> 16:18.684
in that motherfuckin' door.
I ain't sellin' shit,

16:18.684 --> 16:20.851
I ain't signin' shit.

16:20.851 --> 16:22.218
Now, you want to bust
a motherfuckin' move

16:22.218 --> 16:24.351
or you just gonna stand there?

16:24.351 --> 16:27.551
Which one of us do you think
he's gonna kill first?

16:27.551 --> 16:29.784
Definitely not the one
who offed his dog.

16:29.784 --> 16:32.084
Oh, my God. You're right. He's right.
I know.

16:32.084 --> 16:34.818
Listen, he's not gonna do
shit to anybody, okay? I'm a target.

16:34.818 --> 16:36.651
He's just acting out.
Oh, God.

16:36.651 --> 16:39.951
Just... You know.
What, Jeannie? Say it.

16:39.951 --> 16:42.784
I'm super glad that we went
with your foolproof plan

16:42.784 --> 16:45.651
to close Lukas. I mean,
I have so much to learn

16:45.651 --> 16:49.551
from you, Marty.
See you back at the shop.

16:57.618 --> 16:59.851
You can leave the keys in it.

17:07.483 --> 17:10.617
You're a fucking idiot,
do you know that?

17:10.617 --> 17:13.451
Flattery. I love it.

17:13.451 --> 17:15.351
Got anything to drink?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.018
Hey, you do know Dre
doesn't give a fuck

17:25.018 --> 17:26.251
about you, right?

17:26.251 --> 17:28.918
That your partnership
with him is over

17:28.918 --> 17:32.151
and your friendship with him
is beyond over.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.751
You got to take care
of you, Lukas.

17:35.884 --> 17:37.251
Take that money.

17:37.251 --> 17:39.018
Stop being a bitch.

17:39.018 --> 17:43.384
Watch your mouth, baby girl.
Shut up.

17:43.384 --> 17:46.218
Enough with the "baby girls"
and the "shawties."

17:46.218 --> 17:49.151
I'm not impressed.
Well, you look impressed.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.118
Maybe a little.

17:55.218 --> 17:58.184
You know when you know you're
really great at something?

17:58.184 --> 18:02.118
When?
It's when they try and erase you.

18:02.118 --> 18:04.884
It's not when you
get an A-plus

18:04.884 --> 18:06.684
or you win
some stupid award.

18:06.684 --> 18:09.751
It's the moment when

18:09.751 --> 18:11.451
you've accomplished
something

18:11.451 --> 18:15.218
that someone like you
isn't supposed to.

18:15.218 --> 18:18.018
So they say you never did.

18:19.451 --> 18:21.484
Or that you
don't deserve it.

18:21.484 --> 18:22.618
Or something.

18:22.618 --> 18:25.284
And they erase you,
or at least they try.

18:25.284 --> 18:28.918
Why don't you talk to me
like a real fucking person?

18:35.884 --> 18:38.984
My father died
on Tuesday.

18:38.984 --> 18:42.951
The funeral is tomorrow in
the shit town where I grew up,

18:42.951 --> 18:46.384
but I'll be here at my desk...

18:46.384 --> 18:49.251
making money and taking care
of myself.

18:49.251 --> 18:52.284
Because unlike you,
I learned very early on

18:52.284 --> 18:54.218
that no one is on my side
but me.

18:54.218 --> 18:57.084
Hell, that's fucked up.

18:58.751 --> 19:01.318
Okay...

19:01.318 --> 19:02.684
consult me.

19:06.718 --> 19:08.551
Call Marty.

19:08.551 --> 19:11.384
Tell him that you'll
sign away DollaHyde,

19:11.384 --> 19:14.584
but only under
the following conditions...

19:17.218 --> 19:19.384
I'll call him tomorrow.

19:19.384 --> 19:21.784
Make him sweat.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here

19:36.218 --> 19:37.818
Hey, Pop.

19:37.818 --> 19:38.818
Hey, Marty.

19:38.818 --> 19:41.718
Where's Dora the Explorer
tonight?

19:43.584 --> 19:46.018
Man, I need a break.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.018
Heard that.

19:47.018 --> 19:48.218
And Chantelle...
Yes?

19:48.218 --> 19:50.851
...is spending
the night at her place.

19:50.851 --> 19:52.118
Well, that's smart.

19:52.118 --> 19:53.884
Too many sharp
corners around here.

19:53.884 --> 19:56.251
I would hate
if my future stepmom

19:56.251 --> 19:58.384
toddled into a coffee table
or something.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.684
Envy is a bitch, isn't it?

20:03.684 --> 20:05.884
Ah, yes, it is.

20:08.851 --> 20:10.984
Roscoe told me
about this morning.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.884
Yeah, um...

20:15.884 --> 20:16.818
I don't know.

20:16.818 --> 20:18.851
Look, I mean,
he-he knew what I meant.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.584
So you didn't mean
to provoke him?

20:20.584 --> 20:23.118
Just kind of unknowingly pushed
him a little too far

20:23.118 --> 20:25.018
because Marty Kaan is not good
at reading people?

20:25.018 --> 20:29.118
Pop, I gotta tell you, he's
totally off the rails right now.

20:29.118 --> 20:30.951
No, no, it's not that extreme.

20:30.951 --> 20:34.051
And your analysis
is based on what?

20:34.051 --> 20:35.751
You know, you've been
conveniently absent lately

20:35.751 --> 20:37.718
when the shit's been
hitting the fan around here.

20:37.718 --> 20:40.718
This isn't about me, Marty.

20:40.718 --> 20:42.351
Yeah, it's about you.

20:42.351 --> 20:45.318
Look, I'm-I'm juggling
a new shop right now, okay?

20:45.318 --> 20:48.718
And trying to deal with a kid
who's totally, you know,

20:48.718 --> 20:51.084
fucking losing himself right now.
I-I need your help.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.484
You know,
hold up your end.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.951
All right, you're frustrated.

20:53.951 --> 20:56.551
But when I said that it isn't
about me, I meant it now.

20:56.551 --> 20:58.584
This is what it is, Marty.

20:58.584 --> 21:01.418
You get to a place
with your kid,

21:01.418 --> 21:05.351
where everything else
kind of just falls away,

21:05.351 --> 21:08.618
and it's just
the two of you.

21:08.618 --> 21:10.951
You remember.

21:10.951 --> 21:12.618
When your mother died,

21:12.618 --> 21:16.051
you and I were in
a very serious death match.

21:17.918 --> 21:20.951
Yeah. Yeah, we were.

21:20.951 --> 21:22.618
But here we are.

21:22.618 --> 21:23.984
Two grown-ass men.

21:23.984 --> 21:26.751
Yep.

21:26.751 --> 21:28.651
You and Roscoe will get
past this.

21:28.651 --> 21:30.484
Yeah,

21:30.484 --> 21:32.718
if I let him live that long.

21:32.718 --> 21:35.918
I know exactly how you feel.

21:37.951 --> 21:39.384
Good night, son.

21:39.384 --> 21:40.951
Good night, Pop.

21:45.651 --> 21:47.318
Yeah.

21:47.318 --> 21:49.718
Yeah, I understand.

21:51.784 --> 21:53.318
Yeah.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.184
That was Lukas.

22:01.184 --> 22:03.218
Um...

22:04.351 --> 22:05.384
He's done.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.284
He's out.

22:08.284 --> 22:11.051
Um, in lieu of flowers
and cards,

22:11.051 --> 22:12.651
the family requests
that you send

22:12.651 --> 22:14.818
big ol' fat checks
to Kaan and Associates.

22:14.818 --> 22:17.051
Make it happen.

22:17.051 --> 22:18.818
Oh...!

22:18.818 --> 22:20.884
Hey-ey-ey...!

22:20.884 --> 22:23.284
Oh, God, what a relief!
Such a relief.

22:25.018 --> 22:26.018
Gotcha.

22:26.018 --> 22:27.151
Fun fact?

22:27.151 --> 22:28.918
You'll never see
Caitlin's cooter.

22:28.918 --> 22:30.351
How dare you?

22:30.351 --> 22:32.184
So DollaHyde starts
paying us again?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.318
Every crack-covered penny.

22:34.318 --> 22:37.351
Whoo! Dre must
be freaking.

22:37.351 --> 22:40.551
Uh, let's, uh, not ruin
his family dinner just yet

22:40.551 --> 22:44.884
by telling him that Lukas is going
to be asking for $150 million

22:44.884 --> 22:46.351
plus royalties.

22:46.351 --> 22:49.118
$150 million?
Yeah.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.918
Huh.

22:50.918 --> 22:53.484
Well played, Mr. Frye.

22:55.118 --> 22:58.051
I had only suggested
$125 million.

22:58.051 --> 23:01.351
You set me up.

23:01.351 --> 23:04.351
Never.
I got you what you wanted.

23:04.351 --> 23:06.651
Lukas is gone as soon
as he gets the cash.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.684
Yeah, cash
that Dre doesn't have.

23:10.484 --> 23:12.884
Then I guess you're
Lukas's bitch.

23:24.151 --> 23:26.784
All right.
Ten seconds.

23:26.784 --> 23:27.751
Ready to defend.

23:27.751 --> 23:29.718
Hey, Jimmy,
chill out, Jimmy.

23:29.718 --> 23:31.284
This one's Jimmy.
Jimmy!

23:32.718 --> 23:35.184
Ten, nine,

23:35.184 --> 23:37.084
eight, seven...

23:37.084 --> 23:38.284
six, five, four,
three, two, one!

23:40.818 --> 23:43.718
Oh, shit!
That was awesome.

23:43.718 --> 23:45.084
Oh, shit! That was...

23:46.884 --> 23:48.084
All right, that's it.

23:48.084 --> 23:50.418
Get your shit together and get
the fuck out of my house.

23:50.418 --> 23:52.118
Hey, Marty.
I got Cheetos...

23:52.118 --> 23:53.318
Lex, you're out of here.

23:53.318 --> 23:56.551
This fucking dating thing
is deaded.

23:59.751 --> 24:01.451
Right now! Let's go!

24:01.451 --> 24:03.551
Come on, Marty.

24:06.284 --> 24:07.751
You got it.

24:14.651 --> 24:16.351
Get out.

24:17.718 --> 24:19.351
Get out!

24:24.018 --> 24:25.684
Get up, man.

24:25.684 --> 24:28.551
Roscoe, get up.
Get up. Get up.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.951
Hey,

24:29.951 --> 24:31.651
unlock the door.
What are you doing?

24:31.651 --> 24:32.651
No, Dad.

24:32.651 --> 24:33.918
Dad, no.
Unlock the...

24:33.918 --> 24:36.584
We have
to turn around, Dad.

24:36.584 --> 24:38.551
Have to turn,
turn around.

25:22.276 --> 25:23.854
They call him Michelle.

25:30.451 --> 25:31.951
Arms.

25:33.351 --> 25:35.318
All right,
lay back.

25:35.318 --> 25:37.318
Lay back, lay back,
lay back.

25:40.584 --> 25:43.318
Okay, there's a wastebasket
by your head.

25:43.318 --> 25:46.184
If the bed starts spinning,
you know, just...

25:46.184 --> 25:49.618
put one foot
on the ground, 'kay?

25:49.618 --> 25:51.584
Hey, Dad?
What?

25:51.584 --> 25:53.584
Don't be mad at Lex.

25:53.584 --> 25:55.584
It was my idea.

25:55.584 --> 25:58.384
Just try to get some sleep,
all right?

25:58.384 --> 26:00.318
But let me tell you,

26:00.318 --> 26:03.884
if you <i> ever</i> mix a 25-year-old
single malt of mine

26:03.884 --> 26:05.884
with Hawaiian Punch again,

26:05.884 --> 26:08.118
I'm putting you up
for adoption immediately.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.584
You got it?

26:09.584 --> 26:11.384
Oh, shit.

26:12.384 --> 26:15.284
Aw, Dad, my Bottega hobo!

26:15.284 --> 26:17.284
Lesson learned.

26:18.051 --> 26:20.051
Drinking is for boys

26:20.051 --> 26:22.384
with cheap purses.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.784
Ugh.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.618
Thank you, Dad.

26:31.618 --> 26:33.684
I love you, too.

26:34.684 --> 26:36.584
Get some sleep.

26:45.584 --> 26:46.984
What do you think,

26:46.984 --> 26:49.618
we should give this
purse to a <i> real</i> hobo?

26:49.618 --> 26:51.351
Night.
