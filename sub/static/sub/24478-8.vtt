00:02.620 --> 00:04.310
Previously on "In Contempt"...

00:04.413 --> 00:07.103
There's obviously unfinished
business between the two of you.

00:07.206 --> 00:10.586
I want you to finish it.
I'm giving you 30 days.

00:10.689 --> 00:12.931
Pack a bag.
That 30 days starts right now.

00:13.034 --> 00:14.965
- Wanted to hear from you first.
- Blackburn had it coming...

00:15.068 --> 00:16.068
I'm promoting Charlie
to supervise her.

00:16.172 --> 00:18.551
Seriously?

00:18.655 --> 00:19.758
- No gloating?
- I'm gonna gloat. Just later.

00:19.862 --> 00:23.379
No need to discuss,
discourse, dialogue.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.517
Are you off your meds?

00:24.620 --> 00:27.517
This must be your fiancée.
Alison.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.551
So you think you can just...

00:29.655 --> 00:31.448
- end this.
- Sugar, I just did.

00:31.551 --> 00:34.655
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:35.758 --> 00:39.310
So, which is it?
Your place or mine?

00:46.344 --> 00:47.517
Well, hello, spa queen!

00:47.620 --> 00:50.586
You all cleansed
and karma-balanced?

00:50.689 --> 00:55.551
Nope, but I made you this.
It's a dream-catcher.

00:55.655 --> 00:58.827
Honey, that looks more
like a dream-killer.

00:58.931 --> 01:00.862
And please tell me there was
more to your romantic getaway

01:00.965 --> 01:02.724
- than arts and crafts.
- It was great.

01:02.827 --> 01:05.344
Had its ups and downs but...

01:06.172 --> 01:09.103
Bennet and I
might be moving in together.

01:09.206 --> 01:14.068
My, my! Three days of Gwen
and Alison eats a TKO.

01:14.172 --> 01:15.758
Okay, not so fast! Bennet got us
an apartment together,

01:15.862 --> 01:19.827
we're more like co-relocating.
In 27 days

01:19.931 --> 01:21.931
we're either be together
or the lease will be up.

01:22.034 --> 01:23.655
Either way, I will not leave
you high and dry.

01:23.758 --> 01:25.517
I'm not worried about that.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.310
But one weekend away together
and suddenly you're shaking up?

01:28.413 --> 01:30.586
- That's not healthy.
- There's nothing else to do.

01:30.689 --> 01:32.344
We just got to play house
and hope it works.

01:32.448 --> 01:33.655
Thanks.

01:33.758 --> 01:35.896
Don't you have
a murder trial starting?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.827
Have you told him
about Trial-Gwen?

01:37.931 --> 01:41.310
- No, but--
- 'Cause it's is a challenge.

01:41.413 --> 01:42.724
Well, well...

01:42.827 --> 01:44.241
When the cat's away
somebody gets laid.

01:44.344 --> 01:47.241
Derek, Gwen. Gwen, Derek.

01:47.344 --> 01:48.275
- Hi, Derek.
- Good morning.

01:48.379 --> 01:52.206
- Derek has to go.
- Um, thank you.

01:52.965 --> 01:55.379
But do you want
to get some dinner tonight?

01:55.482 --> 01:58.137
- Not really. I'll call you.
- Okay.

01:58.241 --> 02:00.068
Okay.

02:01.241 --> 02:05.965
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

02:10.137 --> 02:12.448
So, what does Dodson think
about Mr How-Did-You-Do there?

02:12.551 --> 02:13.931
I gave Dodson
the old Alabama slammer.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.896
Okay, I need to look that up
in the Urban Dictionary

02:17.000 --> 02:19.931
- and never say that again.
- I mean, we're done. For good.

02:20.034 --> 02:21.827
Couldn't handle
the commitment, huh?

02:21.931 --> 02:24.000
Okay, look.
So, let's just agree that,

02:24.103 --> 02:25.724
in the future, you'll stay away
from men of married persuasion.

02:25.827 --> 02:28.620
Says the woman moving in
with someone's fiancée.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.689
That's just totally different
so you can come back

02:30.793 --> 02:32.689
and get this mic
you just tried to drop.

02:40.241 --> 02:43.379
- She should be here any minute.
- It's a death card.

02:44.206 --> 02:48.862
- I'm sorry, what?
- My tag. I saw you wondering.

02:53.931 --> 02:55.620
Sorry I'm late.
Did Vanessa catch you up?

02:55.724 --> 02:59.206
Yeah, we was just
getting' acquainted.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.172
Okay, so here's the deal:
20 years is the lowest

03:01.275 --> 03:03.689
- the DA's office will go.
- What happened with motions?

03:03.793 --> 03:05.551
Denied.
The prosecution can bring in

03:05.655 --> 03:06.413
all your prior
domestic violence.

03:06.517 --> 03:07.827
That is why the offer is 20.

03:07.931 --> 03:10.206
No, you've got
to get me something better.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.896
I'm not going to be able
to do that, Justin.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.241
They have no motive
to offer you anything less.

03:13.344 --> 03:14.586
You're sitting here on bail
you can't make and--

03:14.689 --> 03:16.724
Your girlfriend
was burned alive.

03:20.172 --> 03:21.827
- Plus, there's your sheet.
- The two drug sales,

03:21.931 --> 03:26.206
- robbery, and you're on parole.
- So you think I did it?

03:26.310 --> 03:27.689
No...

03:27.793 --> 03:29.793
You ever even do a murder case?
How old is she?

03:29.896 --> 03:31.586
Old enough to be your lawyer,
and I'm old enough to tell you

03:31.689 --> 03:35.862
- to shut the hell up. Clear?
- Look at you.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.827
Twenty years. Flat.
Out in about 17.

03:37.931 --> 03:40.034
Do you want it, or not?

03:40.862 --> 03:43.724
Twenty is not an offer.
Just roll the dice.

03:47.896 --> 03:50.586
- You can breathe now.
- Why doesn't he take the plea?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.344
He's not wrong.
They don't have much of a case.

03:52.448 --> 03:54.758
Would you take 20 years based on
the evidence you've seen so far?

03:54.862 --> 03:57.034
- I would if I did it.
- But you're responsible person,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.413
and responsible people
don't light people on fire.

03:59.517 --> 04:00.344
- So you think he did it too?
- Maybe.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.931
Probably. Doesn't matter.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.586
If our guy wants a trial
and his decision is rational,

04:04.689 --> 04:06.758
then we fight like hell
for him at trial.

04:06.862 --> 04:08.896
You wanted more serious cases.
Here's more serious cases.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.172
- He give me the creeps.
- Uncle Ruckus himself!

04:12.275 --> 04:13.793
Thanks for stalling
on the discovery, EJ.

04:13.896 --> 04:16.379
Was that your junior varsity way
of trying to irritate us?

04:16.482 --> 04:19.620
Believe it or not, the world
doesn't revolve around you.

04:19.724 --> 04:20.965
Oh. wait. Are you sure?

04:21.068 --> 04:22.379
I have bigger fish to fry
at the moment.

04:22.758 --> 04:25.413
So, did your client
tell you all about

04:25.517 --> 04:26.931
how he set his girlfriend
on fire?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.206
In gory detail.
Right after we donned

04:28.310 --> 04:30.379
our Satan's capes
and sacrificed small children.

04:30.482 --> 04:32.620
Do you have the discovery?

04:35.965 --> 04:40.896
- What about the photos?
- You sure you wanna see these?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.724
Oh, no, it might be
too much to bear!

04:42.827 --> 04:46.000
- Give me that.
- Enjoy!

04:49.034 --> 04:50.793
Alright. I need three full sets
of these all collated.

04:50.896 --> 04:53.344
And don't forget to use
the yellow tabs every time

04:53.448 --> 04:54.758
you see the complaint,
green for the arresting officer,

04:54.862 --> 04:57.241
and purple for any
inconsistent statement.

04:57.344 --> 04:59.034
- Right, you said it.
- Make sure you get it right.

04:59.137 --> 05:01.310
I need something when
I'm crossing the witness.

05:01.413 --> 05:02.586
I got it. Really.

05:07.137 --> 05:09.620
- What?
- They're not pretty.

05:09.724 --> 05:11.620
That's for sure.

05:11.724 --> 05:14.310
Damn.
Number 13 is super nasty.

05:25.172 --> 05:29.448
- Oh my God. I'm sorry, I just--
- No, they're horrible.

05:29.551 --> 05:30.655
And that's covered
by co-counsel privilege.

05:30.758 --> 05:34.689
- Thank you.
- Okay. When you make copies,

05:34.793 --> 05:37.793
make sure they're collated
by exhibit number....

05:39.344 --> 05:41.620
You coming?

05:45.620 --> 05:46.620
Make sure they're collated
by exhibit number.

05:52.862 --> 05:53.896
Your diet's finally
getting to you.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.482
That, or you're finally
sick of Vanessa.

05:56.586 --> 05:59.000
- Vanessa's great. Lay off her.
- Sugar, I don't have to pretend

05:59.103 --> 06:02.448
to like people I don't like.
That's not mean. That's honest.

06:02.551 --> 06:03.862
- She's trying.
- No. She's snotty,

06:03.965 --> 06:05.103
she's weak,
and she's pretentious.

06:05.206 --> 06:07.448
And you should have never
taken her on a homicide.

06:07.551 --> 06:09.206
Cut her some slack.
She'll be fine.

06:09.310 --> 06:14.655
- Tracy knows, I'm just saying.
- It must be nice to be so wise.

06:16.827 --> 06:20.655
Sergeant Jacob Lockman,
a 14-year veteran with the NYPD,

06:20.758 --> 06:24.034
was killed during
a chance encounter

06:24.137 --> 06:26.344
- with a teenage skateboarder--
- Please, God, not a black man!

06:26.448 --> 06:28.000
suspect in custody,

06:28.103 --> 06:31.655
but not additional
information is being released.

06:35.103 --> 06:39.724
Tracy! I have to go prep
and Franklin's here.

06:40.655 --> 06:44.275
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

06:45.068 --> 06:47.275
Gwen's on trial, Franklin.
She can't talk to you right now.

06:47.379 --> 06:48.517
But I need
to confer with counsel.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.482
Have you been protesting
the library again?

06:50.586 --> 06:52.068
Gwen already told you:

06:52.172 --> 06:54.827
their late-fee policy is not
a form of discrimination.

06:54.931 --> 06:57.758
Are your working for the man,
or for the people?

06:57.862 --> 07:01.137
Man's always makin' up rules.
You can't even talk your mind.

07:01.241 --> 07:03.000
Are you going to be silenced
by the man?

07:03.103 --> 07:05.793
Honey, there's not a man alive
who can silence me.

07:05.896 --> 07:08.827
You know what I think?
I think you're a legal saboteur.

07:08.931 --> 07:11.551
I'm not a saboteur, Franklin.
I'm Gwen's office mate.

07:11.655 --> 07:15.103
Honey, are you off
your meds again?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.344
Those pills have
a radio transmitter.

07:17.448 --> 07:20.000
Okay, you know what? Why don't
we take a trip downstairs

07:20.103 --> 07:22.896
- to social services?
- This whole building is bugged.

07:23.482 --> 07:27.275
- Tell Gwen I need to see her.
- Okay, sure thing.

07:28.068 --> 07:30.793
Nutjob.

07:30.896 --> 07:32.896
- Can I help you?
- Nope, I'm done.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.931
- Doing what?
- As your new supervisor,

07:35.034 --> 07:37.896
it's my duty to prepare
your performance review.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.206
Oh, please. No.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.310
Tom usually just lets me
write it and then he signs.

07:40.413 --> 07:42.551
Well, new sheriff in town.

07:43.137 --> 07:47.896
Oh. You really need to work
on your client sensitivity.

07:49.793 --> 07:54.275
- Wow, Bennet! This is great.
- We have here...

07:54.379 --> 07:56.379
Some clothes, work,

07:56.482 --> 07:59.310
and the two essential
food groups:

07:59.896 --> 08:02.551
Flamebolts and barbecued chips.

08:03.344 --> 08:06.379
Well, you said to make myself
at home, and I'm on trial.

08:06.482 --> 08:07.862
And I meant it.

08:07.965 --> 08:11.172
You know I really love
that you're here, right?

08:18.862 --> 08:22.103
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine, it's just--

08:22.206 --> 08:26.862
- Sorry, it's my case. Homicide.
- Say no more.

08:29.827 --> 08:33.034
- What do you want for dinner?
- Oh, I'm good.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.965
I was thinking, how about
we order something great?

08:36.068 --> 08:41.965
- To inaugurate the place.
- I'm not really hungry, but...

08:42.655 --> 08:44.655
You shouldn't be
drinking too much of this stuff.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.586
I know. And I will quit
right after my trial.

08:47.689 --> 08:50.275
- Promise?
- Yes. I promise.

08:51.827 --> 08:56.241
How about we agree to take
90 minutes tomorrow night

08:56.344 --> 09:00.310
for a romantic, just us
in-our-cool-new-place dinner?

09:00.413 --> 09:03.137
Sounds great, but right now,
I've got a horrible case,

09:03.241 --> 09:05.827
an inexperienced co-counsel
and crime scene photos

09:05.931 --> 09:07.793
that will literally
make you barf.

09:07.896 --> 09:09.862
Did I mention that my client
lit his girlfriend on fire?

09:10.275 --> 09:11.620
- Shit.
- Yeah.

09:12.137 --> 09:15.724
The more awful the case sounds,
the harder I have to work.

09:15.827 --> 09:19.103
- You get that, right?
- Loud and clear.

09:21.275 --> 09:25.689
Just promise me
that you'll get some rest.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.655
I promise.

09:41.310 --> 09:43.896
Vanessa, it's me again.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.344
It's 4:15.
I really need that research.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.896
Can you call me
as soon as you can?

09:54.862 --> 09:58.068
You do know most people
actually sleep, right?

09:58.172 --> 09:59.172
I've heard talk.

09:59.275 --> 10:01.137
Could you just come to bed
for a few hours?

10:01.241 --> 10:02.310
Why don't you just let me work

10:02.413 --> 10:04.586
so I can spare my client
life in prison.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.034
Is it possible
that your client

10:06.137 --> 10:08.896
might do better
with a well-rested lawyer?

10:09.896 --> 10:11.655
Remember the part about
"the more awful the case,

10:11.758 --> 10:14.172
the harder we fight"?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.034
Where is she? I've got
to figure out a way to keep

10:18.137 --> 10:20.448
these horrible photos
out of evidence.

10:20.551 --> 10:21.827
- Can I help?
- Yeah,

10:21.931 --> 10:23.482
you can go back to bed
and let me think.

10:26.034 --> 10:29.000
I'll be there when
you wake up, okay?

10:40.344 --> 10:43.000
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

10:43.103 --> 10:46.000
I didn't get your messages
until this morning.

10:46.103 --> 10:49.896
It's okay, but I really need you
to be more responsive.

10:54.172 --> 10:55.551
- You got my paperwork?
- We just have some photos.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.310
No discovery yet,
but we'll get it soon.

10:58.413 --> 10:59.620
All rise!

11:03.620 --> 11:05.724
I understand the Defense
has a motion.

11:05.827 --> 11:08.344
We do. We move to preclude
all the crime scene photos.

11:08.448 --> 11:09.931
That's ridiculous!

11:10.034 --> 11:11.206
- The photos are evidence.
- Prejudicial evidence.

11:11.310 --> 11:12.793
They show exactly what
defendant did to his girlfriend.

11:12.896 --> 11:15.862
Judge, this is textbook example
of how evidence

11:15.965 --> 11:17.620
is more prejudicial
than probative.

11:17.724 --> 11:18.689
They'll literally
make the jury sick.

11:18.793 --> 11:21.103
Oh, come on!
How bad can they be?

11:37.344 --> 11:39.862
Okay. They're nauseating.

11:39.965 --> 11:43.655
But so was the crime, Counselor.
I'm not going to exclude them.

11:43.758 --> 11:45.689
Then we ask that you limit
the scope to three-four photos.

11:45.793 --> 11:46.965
Anything more than
that is overkill.

11:47.068 --> 11:49.344
That's a reasonable proposal,
Mister Duchay.

11:49.448 --> 11:50.896
Three photos should do it.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.206
And I'll ask that photos
10, 13 and 15 be excluded.

11:53.310 --> 11:54.620
As much as Miss Sullivan
would like

11:54.724 --> 11:56.758
to make our decision for us,
that's not how it works.

11:56.862 --> 11:58.931
Photos 10, 13 and 15 are
the very three we intend to use.

11:59.034 --> 12:02.793
I'll let the People choose
their evidence, Miss Sullivan.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.586
10, 13 and 15 are in,
the rest are out.

12:10.793 --> 12:13.103
Why are you smiling?
We just got played.

12:13.206 --> 12:16.448
No. Photographs 10, 13 and 15
were close-ups of the body.

12:16.551 --> 12:18.620
They don't show the front door.

12:18.724 --> 12:20.275
What's wrong
with the front door?

12:20.379 --> 12:21.655
It's what's not wrong with it.

12:21.758 --> 12:23.758
The lock on the doorknob
is in a locked position.

12:23.862 --> 12:26.689
- So there was no forced entry.
- Which means...

12:26.793 --> 12:30.413
The killer had a key
or the victim let him in.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.965
Which means she knew the killer.

12:33.068 --> 12:34.620
If Duchay knew you wanted
those photos out--

12:34.724 --> 12:37.862
- He'd fight to keep them in.
- Sweet.

12:40.517 --> 12:42.482
We need to clean you up.

12:54.655 --> 12:59.068
- Oh, don't let me interrupt.
- Later.

13:00.206 --> 13:03.724
Nah, I'm good, honey, thanks.
I'll catch the next one.

13:04.344 --> 13:05.448
Let me guess.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.758
- Performance review?
- In a way.

13:06.862 --> 13:08.793
It's Natalie
from the PR firm upstairs.

13:08.896 --> 13:13.931
A little lunchtime lovin'.
Her performance? Stellar.

13:14.241 --> 13:16.068
If you know what I mean.

13:41.103 --> 13:42.655
No.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.586
I keep thinking about how,
without the photos,

13:50.689 --> 13:52.586
the jury will never know
the door was locked.

13:52.689 --> 13:55.931
- Yeah, good for us.
- I know, it just...

13:56.034 --> 14:00.068
- seems dishonest.
- Not dishonest. Tactical.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.068
Believe me, Duchay
would have done the same thing.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.172
But do you really need
to go the extra mile

14:04.275 --> 14:08.034
- for a case like this?
- Yes, we do. Always.

14:08.137 --> 14:10.931
How come you lied to Justin
about not having the discovery?

14:13.275 --> 14:14.758
They have a witness.
A bodega owner who says

14:14.862 --> 14:18.517
he sold Justin lighter fluid
the day before the murder.

14:18.620 --> 14:19.793
Do we know who it is?

14:19.896 --> 14:22.620
They redacted the name
and address.

14:22.724 --> 14:24.862
Wouldn't Justin
still know who it is?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.103
- Yeah.
- You think if he knows

14:26.206 --> 14:28.241
who the witness is,
he might do something?

14:28.344 --> 14:30.068
We don't have a choice.
We have to give that to him.

14:30.172 --> 14:33.103
You can't turn it over if he
might intimidate the witness.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.034
If Duchay was worried,
he could have asked the judge

14:35.137 --> 14:36.586
for a protective order,
and then we wouldn't

14:36.689 --> 14:38.000
even be able
to show this to Justin.

14:38.103 --> 14:39.344
Then tell Duchay!
Maybe he just messed up.

14:39.448 --> 14:41.724
We can't throw our client
under the bus.

14:41.827 --> 14:43.206
We can't broadcast
to the prosecution

14:43.310 --> 14:47.000
they made a mistake and make
the case harder for our client.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.655
Besides, maybe the witness
is wrong or biased,

14:49.758 --> 14:51.241
or maybe he made
the whole thing up.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.241
Maybe Justin could actually
give us good information

14:53.344 --> 14:55.689
- that we don't know about him.
- There's got to be another way.

14:55.793 --> 14:58.310
This guy burned
his girlfriend alive

14:58.413 --> 14:59.793
- and then watched her die.
- Allegedly.

14:59.896 --> 15:03.137
- Gwen, we know he did it.
- How?

15:03.241 --> 15:07.413
How do we know exactly?
This is what you signed up for.

15:07.517 --> 15:10.517
So are you going to be able
to do the cross of the officer?

15:10.620 --> 15:14.827
- Because this is murder trial.
- Yes. Yes.

15:22.172 --> 15:26.448
- He, uh, looks... different.
- I think "great" is the word

15:26.551 --> 15:29.758
you're looking for.
We need women jurors.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.172
- So you got my paperwork?
- What we got is a problem.

15:37.206 --> 15:39.862
- Lighter fluid. What?
- Do you know this guy?

15:39.965 --> 15:41.275
Does he have anything
against you?

15:41.379 --> 15:43.000
- I don't know him.
- Are you sure?

15:43.103 --> 15:45.172
Yeah, I'm sure.
How come she never believes me?

15:45.275 --> 15:48.586
Can you think of any reason
why he would say this?

15:49.103 --> 15:50.586
No.

15:52.310 --> 15:55.482
Justin, I don't need to tell you
that your calls are recorded.

15:55.586 --> 15:58.689
Your mail is read.
So, no calls to your boys.

15:58.793 --> 16:01.586
- No kites, no nothing. Got it?
- I hear you. Yeah.

16:01.689 --> 16:05.241
I mean it.
Just let me do my job.

16:08.827 --> 16:11.931
We arrived on the scene
right after the fire department.

16:12.034 --> 16:14.620
The victim, Cecilia Duncan,
was already dead.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.137
Her body was badly charred.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.620
Most of the flesh from her skull
was burned off.

16:17.724 --> 16:19.689
The apartment smelled strongly
of lighter fluid.

16:19.793 --> 16:22.172
Officer, did you have
any previous contact

16:22.275 --> 16:24.241
with Cecilia Duncan
before you found her dead body?

16:24.344 --> 16:26.862
Yes. I previously responded
to a domestic violence call

16:26.965 --> 16:28.793
- at the same address.
- What happened then?

16:28.896 --> 16:31.310
I found Cecilia with
a black eye, a head wound ..

16:31.413 --> 16:34.000
She said the defendant attacked
her so I arrested Mr. Wilson.

16:34.103 --> 16:36.896
He was then convicted
of assaulting her.

16:37.862 --> 16:39.620
Thank you.
No further questions.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.758
Officer, when you arrested
Mister Wilson, did you find

16:45.862 --> 16:48.103
any evidence of lighter fluid
on his clothes or his skin?

16:48.206 --> 16:50.241
No, but Mister Wilson
evaded us for the first--

16:50.344 --> 16:52.379
- Your Honor!
- Sustained.

16:52.482 --> 16:55.000
You know how to do this,
Officer.

16:56.344 --> 16:58.896
We didn't arrest the defendant
until 24 hours after the fire.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.655
He would have had time to shower
and change his clothes.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.379
Right, but I'm asking--

17:02.482 --> 17:03.241
If he changed his clothes,
we wouldn't find lighter fluid.

17:03.344 --> 17:04.379
My question was did you?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.793
And my answer was
maybe he showered.

17:06.896 --> 17:07.965
That or he didn't have
anything to do with it.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.000
Objection!
Who's doing the questioning?

17:10.103 --> 17:11.965
Counsel wouldn't have to
if the Officer would just

17:12.068 --> 17:13.827
- answer the questions.
- Sustained.

17:13.931 --> 17:16.241
Actually, Judge,
I'll take it from here.

17:19.586 --> 17:20.586
Officer, yes or no.
At the crime scene,

17:20.689 --> 17:22.931
did you find any evidence
that anyone

17:23.034 --> 17:24.517
other than Miss Duncan
had been in the apartment?

17:26.689 --> 17:28.172
- No.
- So the crime scene tells us

17:28.275 --> 17:32.482
only that something horrible
happened. Not who did it.

17:32.586 --> 17:35.103
- That's right.
- No further questions.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.620
It feels a little
like we're hitting a wall.

17:42.724 --> 17:47.896
Just bounce on the ball.
It helps you think. Bounce!

17:48.758 --> 17:50.137
Alright.
Justin's girlfriend

17:50.241 --> 17:52.068
is a crucial witness
we have to undermine him.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.206
We still don't have a solid
theory about why she's lying.

17:54.310 --> 17:57.448
Do you think it could be because
she's just telling the truth?

17:57.551 --> 18:01.724
I really need you to focus.
Bounce.

18:04.172 --> 18:07.000
It's midnight, Gwen. Can't we
just continue this tomorrow?

18:07.103 --> 18:10.206
The witness testifies tomorrow,
Vanessa.

18:10.310 --> 18:13.551
Fine, forget it. I'll just
see you tomorrow at 6 a.m.

18:55.310 --> 18:58.827
Where were you? We had a plan.

18:59.724 --> 19:02.241
- I had to work.
- I know. But you promised me

19:02.344 --> 19:06.034
90 minutes to be together.
Just us. To forget about work.

19:06.137 --> 19:09.517
Bennet, I have a client
who's facing life in prison.

19:09.620 --> 19:10.413
The one who lit
his girlfriend on fire.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.655
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

19:13.758 --> 19:16.103
Make me feel bad for choosing
to spend time on my work.

19:16.206 --> 19:17.862
It's just that I shouldn't
have to be a felon

19:17.965 --> 19:19.172
to get a chance
to spend some time with you.

19:19.275 --> 19:20.931
Okay, you know what?

19:21.034 --> 19:25.551
Let's just hold the feelings
until my homicide trial is over.

19:27.344 --> 19:28.655
Sure.

19:29.172 --> 19:34.620
Good luck in court tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll do great.

19:50.137 --> 19:51.758
When he found out I was pregnant
Justin promised me

19:51.862 --> 19:55.172
he would break up with Cecilia
so I can move in with him,

19:55.275 --> 19:56.862
but he never did.

19:56.965 --> 19:58.137
And did he say why he hadn't
broken up with Cecilia?

19:58.241 --> 20:01.275
- Objection, hearsay!
- Goes to show state of mind.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.827
Overruled.

20:02.931 --> 20:04.586
He said they had
a business together.

20:04.689 --> 20:06.000
She said,
if he broke up with her,

20:06.103 --> 20:08.482
- she'd take everything.
- And what kind of business?

20:08.586 --> 20:09.896
Objection!

20:10.482 --> 20:14.517
- Withdrawn. No more questions.
- Were you promised anything

20:14.620 --> 20:16.275
in exchange for your testimony
here today?

20:16.379 --> 20:19.275
I got arrested for shoplifting.

20:19.379 --> 20:20.793
The prosecutor said,
if I cooperated,

20:20.896 --> 20:22.068
they would take it into account
in my case.

20:22.172 --> 20:24.586
And if you go to jail,
you lose your baby, right?

20:24.689 --> 20:27.103
- Objection!
- Sustained.

20:27.206 --> 20:29.517
Miss Malbon, you must have been
pretty angry to find out

20:29.620 --> 20:30.517
that Justin
was still with Cecilia.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.241
- He wasn't with her.
- Oh!

20:33.344 --> 20:37.241
"Shameless hoe trying to hold on
to a man who doesn't love you".

20:37.344 --> 20:38.965
Isn't that a text
you sent to her?

20:39.068 --> 20:41.034
- Yeah, but that's 'cause--
- "I'm gonna F-you up

20:41.137 --> 20:43.827
if you don't get
the hell out of Justin's house".

20:44.724 --> 20:47.551
Wait. I didn't kill her.
She was a drug dealer.

20:47.655 --> 20:50.413
She probably got high
and set herself on fire.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.758
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Sustained.

20:52.862 --> 20:54.172
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

20:54.275 --> 20:57.724
you will please disregard
the witness' last statement.

20:58.172 --> 21:02.517
- No more questions.
- Then Court is now in recess.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.172
Pass me the victim's rap sheet.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.034
I want to see which officer
arrested her for the drug sales.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.931
- I don't see why it's relevant.
- I asked you to yellow-flag

21:13.034 --> 21:15.206
any mention of her.
Do you have it?

21:15.310 --> 21:17.241
- Yes, but--
- Then hand it over.

21:17.758 --> 21:20.137
I understand tactics,
but are you really going

21:20.241 --> 21:23.758
- to go after the victim?
- If that's what we have to do.

21:23.862 --> 21:26.068
I'm sorry, but I am not
comfortable with this.

21:26.172 --> 21:28.896
We have a client to defend.
And, honestly, Vanessa,

21:29.000 --> 21:30.724
I'm more concerned about
winning this case

21:30.827 --> 21:32.482
than I am about your comfort.

21:40.724 --> 21:42.689
What is going on with you?
You won your last case,

21:42.793 --> 21:44.724
you made supervisor,
why are you doing this?

21:44.827 --> 21:47.689
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

21:47.793 --> 21:49.931
"Miss Campbell displays at best
a perfunctory amount of civility

21:50.034 --> 21:51.931
toward her clients,
with a distinct dose

21:52.034 --> 21:54.379
of disdain toward the more
recalcitrant individuals"?

21:54.482 --> 21:56.862
What? You're trying stuff this
with SAT words?

21:56.965 --> 21:58.965
Try again, sugar.

21:59.655 --> 22:04.896
Insubordination.
Also a problem area for you.

22:06.206 --> 22:07.310
And you're late for court.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.000
I'll have to add that
to your eval.

22:09.103 --> 22:11.827
- I am not doing this right now.
- Use your inside voice.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.793
Charlie!

22:14.448 --> 22:15.896
According to sources,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.827
the shooter's name
is Jackson Whitmore.

22:17.931 --> 22:20.482
Sources say that he
and the officer struggled,

22:20.586 --> 22:23.551
and that the officer
was shot with his own gun.

22:23.655 --> 22:25.482
Witnesses, however, contend

22:25.586 --> 22:27.758
that the officer
was choking the young man.

22:27.862 --> 22:31.517
- This could get really ugly.
- Yeah, it sure could.

22:35.413 --> 22:38.689
Officer Fisher, isn't it true
that in 2012 you had occasion

22:38.793 --> 22:41.034
to arrest the victim
for selling crack cocaine?

22:41.137 --> 22:42.724
I don't remember.

22:42.827 --> 22:45.379
Perhaps this arrest report
will refresh your recollection.

22:48.931 --> 22:50.000
I guess I did.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.758
And did that arrest
result in a conviction?

22:51.862 --> 22:55.137
Objection!
Your Honor, may we approach?

23:00.000 --> 23:04.379
Cecilia Duncan took the rap
for the defendant in this case.

23:04.482 --> 23:06.172
The drugs were really his.

23:06.275 --> 23:08.310
That's a nice theory, Judge,
but this is issue preclusion.

23:08.413 --> 23:10.000
There's a certificate
of conviction.

23:10.103 --> 23:11.931
We're not going to re-litigate
the issue of who owned the drugs

23:12.034 --> 23:16.172
in that case, Mister Duchay.
You may proceed, Miss Sullivan.

23:16.275 --> 23:20.172
Miss Duncan was convicted of
drug sales and served two years.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.000
- Correct?
- Yes.

23:22.103 --> 23:24.275
You also arrested her
for assault, didn't you?

23:24.379 --> 23:26.482
Miss Duncan beat up a woman
to collect on a drug debt.

23:26.586 --> 23:28.620
- Allegedly.
- Well, you arrested her for it.

23:28.724 --> 23:30.103
- Yes.
- Pretty typical behavior

23:30.206 --> 23:31.586
for a drug dealer
in that neighborhood, right?

23:31.689 --> 23:33.310
- Objection!
- Sustained.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.551
Fair to say that drug dealers
can have a lot of enemies?

23:35.655 --> 23:37.206
- Yes.
- So Miss Duncan's death

23:37.310 --> 23:38.241
could be a result of her
drug-dealing business, right?

23:38.344 --> 23:40.172
- Objection!
- Withdrawn.

23:40.275 --> 23:43.068
No further questions.

23:45.068 --> 23:49.551
- That's got to feel good.
- I can't take this.

23:50.034 --> 23:52.034
Vanessa!

24:02.655 --> 24:05.275
You need to take me
off this trial.

24:05.379 --> 24:07.551
- Rookie, say what?
- I'm not ready.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.413
- I thought I was, but--
- Okay. Whoa! Easy now.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.862
You're the one who wanted
more serious cases.

24:11.965 --> 24:14.413
I know, but Gwen calls me
like five times a night,

24:14.517 --> 24:16.379
and she may be undead,
because she never sleeps,

24:16.482 --> 24:19.724
and she acts like it's WWIII,
and she does horrible things,

24:19.827 --> 24:21.827
and that guy
burned up his girlfriend!

24:21.931 --> 24:23.586
And I know I'm not
supposed to care,

24:23.689 --> 24:25.551
but I can't stop
thinking about it.

24:25.655 --> 24:29.586
- And I'm freaking out.
- Freaking out is what trial is.

24:29.689 --> 24:32.379
I can't do this. Please.
I'm asking you as my supervisor.

24:32.482 --> 24:36.931
Okay. Okay.
Let me talk to Gwen.

24:37.482 --> 24:41.448
But for now you stay on.
Understood?

24:46.448 --> 24:48.551
Sullivan.

24:49.517 --> 24:52.241
- Sullivan!
- What?

24:52.344 --> 24:54.068
I'm on trial,
in case you didn't notice.

24:54.172 --> 24:55.620
I can see that.
We need to talk.

24:55.724 --> 24:58.517
Don't try on your little
supervisor shit with me.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.448
You know what makes
a good supervisor?

25:00.551 --> 25:02.206
Being empathetic enough
to know when not to talk.

25:02.310 --> 25:04.379
- You're burning out the rookie.
- No. She's burned out.

25:04.482 --> 25:06.551
- The rookie's fine.
- The rookie is not fine.

25:06.655 --> 25:08.103
The rookie is distressed

25:08.206 --> 25:10.517
because you're sucking her
into your orbit of crazy.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.310
You know I'm working on
a really hard homicide, Charlie.

25:12.965 --> 25:16.068
There's a reason we start
them off with misdemeanors.

25:16.172 --> 25:17.448
They're not supposed
to just jump into murders,

25:17.551 --> 25:20.551
especially
not disgusting ones like this.

25:20.655 --> 25:22.379
- She complained?
- Of course not.

25:22.482 --> 25:23.896
- But I can see it.
- Bullshit, Charlie!

25:24.000 --> 25:25.448
You haven't been able to see
past your own reflection

25:25.551 --> 25:27.137
since you were six.

25:27.241 --> 25:29.482
Aside from the fact that you
just insulted your superior,

25:29.586 --> 25:31.862
as your supervisor,
I'm telling you:

25:31.965 --> 25:33.310
burning out the rookie
is bad for us.

25:33.413 --> 25:35.551
We need warm bodies
around here.

25:35.655 --> 25:38.206
Especially warm Caldwell
fellow bodies.

25:38.310 --> 25:40.793
So don't burn out the rookie.
We cool?

25:40.896 --> 25:43.620
- You sound like Tom.
- That's my job.

25:43.724 --> 25:46.103
Oh, oh, wait!
Have you heard this song?

25:54.758 --> 25:57.758
Flag the second page for me.
Oh, God, you again.

25:57.862 --> 25:59.137
I was hoping
you were a hallucination

25:59.241 --> 26:01.137
- that I only saw the courtroom.
- And I was hoping

26:01.241 --> 26:02.827
that you'd fall in love
and move far, far away.

26:02.931 --> 26:04.586
- What do you want, EJ?
- New offer.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.724
I'll give your guy 14 years
right now.

26:06.827 --> 26:08.551
Or we could start his funeral.

26:08.655 --> 26:09.586
You're dropping this offer
in the middle of a trial?

26:09.689 --> 26:11.862
My assessment of the case
has shifted.

26:11.965 --> 26:14.068
My 98% chance of winning
just dropped to 94%.

26:14.172 --> 26:15.931
That's funny. It sounds to me
like you're finally realizing

26:16.034 --> 26:17.793
I've got your scrawny ass
on the ropes.

26:17.896 --> 26:19.896
Tell you what? Why don't you
just call your next witness?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.827
Don't you want to run it
by your client?

26:21.931 --> 26:23.827
My client will believe me
when I tell him you're bluffing.

26:23.931 --> 26:26.068
Then I'll send you some tissue
when he gets life.

26:26.551 --> 26:29.965
Are the People prepared
to proceed?

26:35.172 --> 26:36.724
Your Honor,
I've been informed this morning

26:36.827 --> 26:38.862
that our key witness, Mr. Khan,
the bodega owner

26:38.965 --> 26:41.931
who sold the lighter fluid
to the defendant--

26:42.896 --> 26:48.931
- Yes, Counselor, what is it?
- He's been murdered.

26:50.137 --> 26:51.793
Oh, my Gosh.

26:56.379 --> 26:57.793
You just tried
to sell me a plea?

26:57.896 --> 27:00.482
Your scumbag client
had a witness murdered.

27:00.586 --> 27:03.068
If you had proof of that,
you'd be arresting him now.

27:03.172 --> 27:04.896
- Did you give him discovery?
- Of course, I did.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.724
- He's my client!
- How could you be so reckless?

27:06.827 --> 27:09.724
- This is on you.
- Don't you dare pin this on me!

27:09.827 --> 27:11.724
If you had concerns
about your witness' safety,

27:11.827 --> 27:13.931
you could have asked
for a protective order.

27:14.034 --> 27:16.206
- You didn't, which is your bad.
- Counselor!

27:16.310 --> 27:19.206
Did you have any specific reason
to be worried about the safety

27:19.310 --> 27:21.034
- of the witness?
- Of course not!

27:21.137 --> 27:23.551
We move to dismiss this case
for lack of evidence.

27:23.655 --> 27:24.931
That's some cold-ass shit!

27:25.034 --> 27:26.310
Without the witness,
there is no evidence

27:26.413 --> 27:28.379
connecting my client
to the crime.

27:28.482 --> 27:30.344
The motion is denied, Counselor.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.448
Mister Duchay,
do you have anything else?

27:32.551 --> 27:33.965
- No, Your Honor.
- Miss Sullivan,

27:34.068 --> 27:36.482
- are you presenting a defense?
- Not anymore.

27:36.586 --> 27:39.103
Okay, then.
Summations after lunch.

27:41.931 --> 27:43.275
If that man's blood
is on your hands...

27:43.379 --> 27:46.310
Tell yourself that all you want,
EJ, but in the dark of night,

27:46.413 --> 27:49.103
you know this was your screw-up.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.344
Don't start.

28:29.724 --> 28:31.551
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

28:31.655 --> 28:33.517
You sure?
'Cause I'm pretty sure

28:33.620 --> 28:36.586
you asked Charlie
to take you off my case.

28:36.689 --> 28:41.000
- I'm sorry. It's just that--
- I chose you.

28:42.724 --> 28:47.241
I took you under my wing and
I chose you for a murder case.

28:47.344 --> 28:51.103
I know. And I'm grateful.
I really am.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.310
- But he is awful.
- We find for everyone, Vanessa.

28:55.413 --> 28:57.724
- Everyone.
- Yeah, we say that.

28:57.827 --> 29:00.586
But this psycho client killed
someone and he might go free.

29:00.689 --> 29:02.793
- And he's guilty!
- What do you want to do?

29:02.896 --> 29:06.241
You want to hold your own
mini-trial before you decide

29:06.344 --> 29:07.586
who it is you're
going to represent?

29:07.689 --> 29:09.206
We are supposed to be fighting
for justice.

29:09.310 --> 29:11.379
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

29:12.137 --> 29:14.758
The canons of ethics demand
that prosecutors pursue justice.

29:14.862 --> 29:20.206
Our job is to fight like hell
for every single client.

29:20.310 --> 29:22.206
Because it's not a fair fight.

29:22.310 --> 29:23.931
It's just you and me
against them,

29:24.034 --> 29:26.827
and their cops, and their labs,
and their corrupt-ass judges.

29:26.931 --> 29:30.758
We're fighting for the underdog.
And you're damned right,

29:30.862 --> 29:34.103
we fight to the death
for every single one of them.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.586
Because if we can't win
when our clients are guilty,

29:36.689 --> 29:38.551
but the case against
them is shitty,

29:38.655 --> 29:41.586
we can't win
when they're innocent.

29:41.689 --> 29:45.241
And if you don't like it,
it's high-time

29:45.344 --> 29:48.379
you take your bougie-ass
back to Caldwell.

29:51.448 --> 29:55.482
Now get out.
I have a summation to finish.

30:10.620 --> 30:13.206
Have you turned in
my review yet?

30:14.000 --> 30:18.344
Good. I evaluated myself.
Honestly.

30:27.551 --> 30:31.344
I'm going to stick
with what I wrote.

30:31.448 --> 30:35.172
Wow. Is this a bribe?
Actually, does it matter?

30:35.275 --> 30:40.517
- So we'll go with my eval then.
- No. We'll go with mine.

30:46.655 --> 30:49.413
This is better
than what I wrote for myself.

30:51.310 --> 30:55.793
Thank you, sugar.
Why the change?

30:55.896 --> 30:59.206
Something Gwen said
about being empathetic.

30:59.310 --> 31:03.758
And I realized I might have been
acting like an asshole, so...

31:04.862 --> 31:06.965
Is there anything else
you want to talk about?

31:07.068 --> 31:09.344
Like what?

31:09.448 --> 31:10.793
She won't know
unless you tell her, honey.

31:10.896 --> 31:12.517
Natalie? She's just a girl
from upstairs.

31:16.586 --> 31:19.551
I need to go file this one.
This is really nice.

31:19.655 --> 31:21.310
Oh, yeah, it is nice.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.448
- I'm keeping this.
- No!

31:27.862 --> 31:29.931
Judge, I'm sorry.
I don't know where she is.

31:30.034 --> 31:31.689
Unless she was going to deliver
the closing statement...

31:31.793 --> 31:35.172
- No, that will be me.
- Then let's get to it.

31:35.275 --> 31:37.482
You can fill her in afterwards.

31:40.620 --> 31:44.517
Let's be clear about one thing
that matters in this case.

31:44.620 --> 31:48.413
There is no evidence that
actually links Mr. Wilson

31:48.517 --> 31:52.482
to the death of Miss Duncan.
None.

31:52.965 --> 31:55.310
Mr. Duchay will tell you all
about their history

31:55.413 --> 31:56.655
of domestic violence,
but while that makes

31:56.758 --> 32:02.413
Mr Wilson unlikeable,
it does not make him a murderer.

32:03.034 --> 32:04.827
Mr. Duchay will also tell you
about Linda Malbon,

32:04.931 --> 32:09.344
his ex-girlfriend,
who supposedly provided motive.

32:09.448 --> 32:10.482
Except there are
plenty of other reasons

32:10.586 --> 32:15.034
why Miss Duncan
might have ended up dead.

32:15.689 --> 32:19.758
She was a crack dealer who lived
a life of crime and violence.

32:19.862 --> 32:22.689
Who knows who she might have
crossed or shorted?

32:22.793 --> 32:24.689
Any number of people
might have had beef with her,

32:24.793 --> 32:30.482
including Linda Malbon herself.
The sad truth is this:

32:31.137 --> 32:36.172
When you live by drug violence,
you often die by drug violence.

32:37.137 --> 32:41.620
All the prosecution has
are theories and conjecture.

32:41.724 --> 32:43.862
They certainly didn't bring you
any witnesses who provided

32:43.965 --> 32:48.551
any evidence directly connecting
Mr. Wilson to the crime.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.310
You swore an oath to do a job,
to follow that singular rule

32:54.793 --> 33:00.137
of holding the prosecution
to their burden of proof.

33:00.241 --> 33:04.793
They must prove Mr. Wilson
guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

33:07.137 --> 33:10.551
Ladies and gentlemen, you don't
have to like Mr. Wilson.

33:10.655 --> 33:15.034
But you must
find him not guilty.

33:21.758 --> 33:26.379
Miss Sullivan says there is
no evidence in this case.

33:26.758 --> 33:29.965
Well, you heard the evidence.
You heard it

33:30.068 --> 33:33.034
from his current girlfriend,
the mother of his child,

33:33.137 --> 33:36.103
tell you about his motive
to kill Cecilia Duncan.

33:36.206 --> 33:38.620
How she threatened to take
everything if they broke up.

33:38.724 --> 33:42.965
You also heard that
he was violent with the victim.

33:43.068 --> 33:46.482
he had an ongoing history
of beating her up.

33:46.586 --> 33:48.517
Now, Miss Sullivan
would have you believe

33:48.620 --> 33:52.310
that it is a long road
from assault to murder.

33:52.413 --> 33:55.000
It's not. And everyone
sitting in here knows it.

33:55.965 --> 33:59.689
With domestic violence,
women all to often end up dead

33:59.793 --> 34:02.000
at the hand of their abuser.

34:02.103 --> 34:07.379
This man had motive.
He had opportunity.

34:07.482 --> 34:11.620
And that is enough
to make him a murderer.

34:24.827 --> 34:26.551
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

34:26.655 --> 34:28.482
I understand you have a verdict.

34:28.586 --> 34:31.586
- We do, Your Honor.
- How do you find?

34:31.689 --> 34:34.275
On the charge of murder
of the second degree,

34:34.379 --> 34:36.931
we find the defendant,
Justin Wilson,

34:37.034 --> 34:39.482
not guilty.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.310
Nice job.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.965
I always knew you was a winner.

35:02.241 --> 35:03.379
All I've been able
to think about

35:03.482 --> 35:06.724
is whether or not
I did the right thing.

35:06.827 --> 35:10.103
She told me we had ethical duty
not to say anything.

35:10.206 --> 35:12.586
But I should have
said something.

35:12.689 --> 35:15.620
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

35:15.724 --> 35:17.862
I mean, I messed up.
I should have asked

35:17.965 --> 35:19.655
for a protective order,
and I didn't.

35:19.758 --> 35:22.689
But Gwen shouldn't have given
the report to him.

35:22.793 --> 35:24.413
I mean, she just wants to win.

35:24.517 --> 35:27.482
She doesn't care
about the greater good.

35:27.586 --> 35:30.793
I used to think that
I could do this job, but now...

35:30.896 --> 35:33.482
But now you're starting
to see the truth.

35:33.586 --> 35:35.206
That there's no difference
between the criminals,

35:35.310 --> 35:40.000
- and the ones who defend them.
- And where does that leave me?

35:41.827 --> 35:46.551
I don't know.
I guess you'll have to decide.

37:05.758 --> 37:07.344
Bennet!

37:16.931 --> 37:19.413
Bennet!

37:21.344 --> 37:24.965
- I heard you won your case.
- Yeah.

37:25.068 --> 37:29.310
I also heard about the witness
and I... I'm sorry.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.344
I am too.

37:33.655 --> 37:36.448
You know you didn't do
anything wrong, right?

37:36.551 --> 37:38.724
I know, but...

37:44.034 --> 37:45.344
Someone's dead.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.862
Look, I know me being on trial
is really hard to deal with.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.827
You being on trial
is not the hard part.

37:53.931 --> 37:55.862
It's who you become
when you're on trial.

37:55.965 --> 37:57.655
And, I know you're
under a lot of pressure

37:57.758 --> 38:00.586
and you have people's lives
in your hands, but--

38:00.689 --> 38:03.896
It's not an excuse
to shut you out.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.103
I know. And I'm sorry.

38:10.586 --> 38:13.172
- I bought us a cake.
- A cake.

38:13.275 --> 38:15.586
I don't cook and a whole meal
would have gotten cold,

38:15.689 --> 38:19.482
so I ordered us a cake.
It says "home sweet home".

38:20.724 --> 38:24.241
I'm in love with the worst
potential wife ever.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.931
- Is that so bad?
- Uh-uh.

38:27.034 --> 38:29.758
It's just going to take
a little getting used to.

38:33.206 --> 38:34.931
Does that mean
you want some cake?

38:35.034 --> 38:38.000
I want some cake.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.379
It's good. It's chocolate.

38:41.482 --> 38:43.793
Oh! I got you these.

38:43.896 --> 38:48.034
I wanted to give them to you
during our celebration dinner.

38:50.275 --> 38:51.655
A private tour

38:51.758 --> 38:53.586
of the National Museum
of African-American history?

38:53.689 --> 38:56.896
- Haven't you been already?
- Not with you.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.413
Oh, Bennet.

39:01.137 --> 39:04.000
Oh shit, that's the courthouse.
I... I have to--

39:04.103 --> 39:05.517
It's okay.

39:07.586 --> 39:09.689
Gwen Sullivan.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.517
Yes, Your Honor, of course.
I'll be right there.

39:17.034 --> 39:18.344
I get it. Go.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.172
Come in.

39:37.965 --> 39:39.068
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

39:39.172 --> 39:40.482
Of course, it sounded urgent.

39:40.586 --> 39:44.103
You're aware of the cop
that was killed?

39:44.206 --> 39:46.827
Yes, it's been
all over the news.

39:46.931 --> 39:49.586
I want you to represent
the defendant.

39:49.689 --> 39:51.448
Me? Why?

39:51.551 --> 39:54.000
A white cop killed
by a young black man.

39:54.103 --> 39:57.310
The witnesses say he shot
the officer in self-defense.

39:57.413 --> 39:59.758
This case is going
to be bigger than Ferguson.

39:59.862 --> 40:01.655
The prosecution
has been building a case

40:01.758 --> 40:04.000
since the shot was fired.
The black community... no!

40:04.103 --> 40:06.275
The whole city need to know.

40:06.379 --> 40:09.413
This kid is going to get
a fair trial.

40:09.517 --> 40:13.275
I can't think of
a better attorney than you.

40:13.689 --> 40:15.275
I don't know what to say.

40:15.379 --> 40:18.103
Right now,
you don't have to say anything.

40:18.206 --> 40:20.206
But there is something
you could do.

40:20.310 --> 40:21.965
- What's that?
- You could go home

40:22.068 --> 40:24.310
and get some sleep.
You're about to be the attorney

40:24.413 --> 40:27.344
in what could be
the trial of a lifetime.

40:36.448 --> 40:38.310
Next time, on "In Contempt":

40:38.413 --> 40:40.586
Jackson Alan Whitmore
of Washington Heights

40:40.689 --> 40:44.137
is accused of shooting
officer Jacob Lockman.

40:44.241 --> 40:45.655
Like so many other black men
in this country,

40:45.758 --> 40:49.862
Jackson was aggressively
confronted by a police officer.

40:49.965 --> 40:52.827
The prosecution is moving
to preclude self-defense.

40:52.931 --> 40:55.068
Shouldn't you be sitting
at the other table, Counselor?

40:55.172 --> 40:56.310
Miss Hastings recently
joined our office, Your Honor.

40:56.413 --> 40:59.137
You don't eat well,
you don't sleep,

40:59.241 --> 40:59.793
and you're addicted
to that shit.

40:59.896 --> 41:00.827
I'm fine.

41:00.931 --> 41:04.931
Officer, isn't--
