08:52.140 --> 08:54.316
Yeah, well,
that's because he knows

08:54.359 --> 08:56.448
it'll get Murphy Mason
too close for comfort.

08:56.492 --> 08:59.147
I feel like I could just
expedite this whole process,

08:59.190 --> 09:00.670
and go straight
to the superintendent about

09:00.714 --> 09:02.716
Chief Alper.
She-she seems like she likes me.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.456
Yeah, she only likes you
because you found

09:04.500 --> 09:06.720
the body of a huge drug dealer.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.287
She is just like him--
it's all optics.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.203
But if she finds out one
of her chiefs is dirty, though?

09:12.247 --> 09:13.944
Then it'll make her
look terrible.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.556
Your best bet is finding hard
evidence against the chief.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.688
And your only lead is
Murphy Mason.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.385
But she fled.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.865
Then find her.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.352
Can I help you?

09:30.395 --> 09:32.746
Ms. Mason, we're
from Chicago PD.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.748
We just have a few
questions for you.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.010
JOSH:
It's about Murphy.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.017
What's going on?Uh, I'm Gene Clemens.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.453
Uh-huh. Yeah.I'm Josh Wallace.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.498
And, uh, we're trying
to locate your daughter.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.589
Is she okay?

09:49.632 --> 09:51.982
She's actually wanted
in a murder investigation.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.988
That's not, uh...

09:58.032 --> 10:00.643
No, that's-that's not possible.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.558
It is, actually.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.342
She and her friends
were trafficking drugs

10:04.386 --> 10:06.170
out of Guiding Hope
for Nia Bailey,

10:06.214 --> 10:07.737
a high-profile drug dealer.[stammers]

10:07.781 --> 10:09.826
Now we have reason
to believe that...

10:09.870 --> 10:12.437
they killed her and
are now on the run.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.570
What?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.616
Uh...

10:18.182 --> 10:20.620
No, uh, I don't think

10:20.663 --> 10:22.796
you have the...Have you heard
from her at all?

10:22.839 --> 10:25.450
Maybe know where
she might be?

10:28.497 --> 10:30.891
She's hiking
the Appalachian Trail.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.632
With her friends. That's all...

10:32.675 --> 10:35.591
Ma'am, it's clear
you've been crying.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.549
I don't think you'd be
this upset if you really thought

10:37.593 --> 10:39.334
that your daughter was just
going on a hiking trip.

10:39.377 --> 10:42.511
Can I ask what number
she called from

10:42.554 --> 10:46.907
to tell you about this bogus
Appalachian Trail story?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.346
Her cell.

10:53.043 --> 10:57.700
Look, Mrs. Mason,
Murphy is in danger.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.876
This woman they
killed, she has

10:59.920 --> 11:02.400
a lot of people out
there who want revenge.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.838
If we can get to her
before they can,

11:04.881 --> 11:07.405
yes, we will have to
put her behind bars...

11:07.449 --> 11:10.887
Oh, my......but at least
she'll be alive.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.063
We can protect her.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.891
And it's a far better outcome
than the alternative.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.806
Trust me.

11:16.850 --> 11:20.767
Now, did she call
from that cell?

11:20.810 --> 11:23.291
Because our records show
that she hasn't made

11:23.334 --> 11:26.686
any outgoing phone calls
in the last two days.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.691
Yeah, it was her cell.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.694
Okay? Uh...

11:34.737 --> 11:36.173
Look, I need to, uh,

11:36.217 --> 11:37.740
get to sleep, so...

11:37.784 --> 11:40.003
It's late.
Okay. Understood.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.877
Uh, I know this is
incredibly unprofessional,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.401
but would you mind
if I used your bathroom?

11:46.444 --> 11:49.796
It's, uh, right down the hall.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.885
Would you mind
lending me a hand?

11:55.062 --> 11:57.020
This way.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.761
[mouthing]

12:07.770 --> 12:10.251
GENE:
Thank you.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.166
JOSH:
Good night.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.691
Did you get it?Get what?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.388
The number on her phone.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.129
That's what the whole
bathroom thing was about.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.479
Did you not see me pointing?Oh, man, I thought that

12:21.523 --> 12:23.351
you just really had to pee.
You had all that iced tea

12:23.394 --> 12:25.005
on the way over here,
so I just thought that...

12:25.048 --> 12:27.007
The phone number is how
we're gonna track Murphy.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.010
Yeah, yeah, no,
I know, I know. You just...

12:30.053 --> 12:31.794
It's right here
on my hand.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.709
[laughs]
You're too easy.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.103
The area code's
in northern Minnesota.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.931
Think they're going to Canada?

12:37.974 --> 12:40.281
Hundo P.
Isn't that what you say?

12:40.324 --> 12:43.327
Hundo P.
That is what I say.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.114
MAX:
I'll grab the passports
from that Jason guy.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.159
Be back in a few hours.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.118
Okay. Yeah. Totally.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.816
Yeah, maybe... maybe bring
Murphy or Jess with you, though.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.339
I'll take care of the
Pretzel paperwork.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.080
Um, just 'cause you've
been driving so much.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.778
I don't want you to
fall asleep on the road.I'm good.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.867
He's afraid
you're gonna ditch us.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.956
No, I didn't say that. I'm just
a fan of the buddy system.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.435
You know?
Personally, I think it's

13:04.479 --> 13:05.828
a tried-and-true system--
very reliable.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.656
Uh... very good system.It's fine.

13:07.699 --> 13:08.962
I'll-I'll-I'll go.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.399
No, thanks.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.880
If you guys don't trust me,
Jess can come with me, okay?

13:13.923 --> 13:15.882
[engine starts]We're gonna be late,
Jess. Let's go.

Well, um...

13:23.628 --> 13:25.456
hurry up.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.633
Uh, hurry back, or we'll start
drinking without you guys.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.983
[clears throat]

13:30.026 --> 13:31.636

Hi. Uh, I reserved a--

13:37.686 --> 13:40.776
two rooms under the name
Gordon Howard.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.865
[laughs] Gordon.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.694
Never met a Gordon
under like a hundred.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.609
Family name.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.611
We call him, uh, Gordo.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.265
[laughs]

13:51.308 --> 13:53.441
Should get your boyfriend
to spring for a nicer hotel.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.009
Well, maybe her boyfriend
is saving up

13:56.052 --> 13:58.794
for a nice house
that we're gonna all...

13:58.838 --> 14:00.840
that we're gonna
live in someday.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.232
Okay.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.321
That's 58 bucks for each room.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.109
Just call it 60.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.675
Thank you.No problem.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.590
Need you to sign in
here, Gordo.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.418
Oh.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.860
Here. Room three.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.383
I'm the only one working,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.167
so you can ring me
if you need anything.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.039
I'll keep your friend's key
here at the front desk.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.779
FELIX:
Thank you.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.259
Thanks.
Enjoy.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.134
So, who'd you call
at the...

14:34.177 --> 14:35.875
at the gas station?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.312
My dad.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.791
Yeah, how'd that go?

14:39.835 --> 14:41.881
It's good.
Good.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.146
I don't know, just hearing
my mom's voice, I just...

14:46.189 --> 14:49.279
I just wanted to give her
a really big hug, you know?

14:52.152 --> 14:54.110
I'm sorry.
That was really insensitive.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.198
I'm sorry.It's fine.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.634
It's-it's fine.
Okay.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.419
My mom died
a long time ago, Jess.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.160
Don't worry about it.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.727
So, what are you gonna do
when you get to Canada?

15:02.771 --> 15:04.947
[sighs]

15:04.991 --> 15:08.168
Um, find a job as a
line cook somewhere.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.910
Save enough money
to maybe open up

15:10.953 --> 15:13.042
my own restaurant,
you know?

15:13.086 --> 15:15.131
Yeah. That sounds great.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.220
What kind of restaurant?

15:17.264 --> 15:19.222
Nothing fancy. Just...

15:19.266 --> 15:22.356
really good diner food.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.272
Pancakes, hash browns,
that kind of thing.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.317
That sounds good.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.539
Yeah, the whole thing actually
sounds really nice right now.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.106
[chuckles softly]

15:34.672 --> 15:36.936
Kind of looking forward to it.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.938
Mm-hmm.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.375
They called from Silverdale
at 9:00 p.m.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.507
Closest border crossing is
International Falls,

15:43.551 --> 15:45.118
which is
an hour and a half away,

15:45.161 --> 15:46.946
and it closes at 10:00.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.209
So they're still
on this side of the border.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.254
Mm-hmm.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.735
Just got security photos
from the time of the call.

Ah. There they are, baby.

the license plate. Enhance it.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.395
Uh, no, that's not a real thing.Oh.

16:01.438 --> 16:04.224
All right, so, look, we'll get
the word out to local cops

16:04.267 --> 16:06.095
and border patrol
in International Falls,

16:06.139 --> 16:07.227

16:07.270 --> 16:09.011
for an orange...
I think that's an Aztek.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.534
Aztek. Yeah. Right.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.624
Tell them to check motels,

they can spend the night.Mm-hmm.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.715
On it.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.415
I'm gonna get you.

Do you know if this
place has, like,

16:27.290 --> 16:30.076
an ice machine or something?Oh, yeah, ice.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.600
That'll solve all
your problems with Max.Shut up, Felix.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.645
No, really, I think,
once he sees this spread

16:34.689 --> 16:37.126
of tequila and pork rinds,
he's just gonna be like,

16:37.170 --> 16:39.955
"Wow, Murphy, as a chef,
you really get me.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.087
I love you so much."I know you think it's stupid,

16:41.130 --> 16:42.784
but I really need to
fix things with him.

I can't believe this is what
you're thinking about right now.

I just need him
to forgive me.

Can we please... can you
please help me get some ice?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.444

to let guests use it.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.496
[whispers]:
Come here, buddy. Come here.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.150
Good boy.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.109
[sighs]

18:30.152 --> 18:32.328
[bell jingles]

18:32.372 --> 18:34.722
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

18:34.765 --> 18:36.202
Hi.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.726
Hello.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.336
Hi.Hi. [clears throat]

18:40.380 --> 18:42.817
Uh, I'm Officer Brandt.
Uh, I'm looking for

18:42.860 --> 18:44.601
a blind girl
and three friends

18:44.645 --> 18:47.561
traveling in an orange
Pontiac Aztek.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.913
Um... okay.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.133
I haven't, uh...[Pretzel panting]

18:54.176 --> 18:57.440
I haven't seen anyone, um,
that-that looks like that,

18:57.484 --> 19:01.792
but, um, if you do want
to leave your information,

19:01.836 --> 19:05.883
I'm happy to let you know if,
uh, anything turns up.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.755
Okay. Uh, yeah,
though I actually

19:07.798 --> 19:09.322
talked to one of
the guests outside,

19:09.365 --> 19:10.888
and they-they said
they saw an orange

19:10.932 --> 19:12.890
Pontiac Aztek in the parking
lot a little while ago.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.414
Really?Yeah.

19:14.457 --> 19:18.896
Um, if there was, I don't...
see one anymore.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.421
So maybe they...
Yeah, I don't know.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.162
Huh. Okay.I don't see one, but...

19:23.205 --> 19:25.599
Uh, well, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna hang around.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.688
Okay.See if the-the Aztek comes back.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.125
Sure. No problem.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.345
All good.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.347
[papers rustling]

19:34.390 --> 19:36.958
Cute dog.
Thank you. He, uh...

19:37.001 --> 19:39.090
Yeah, he's a good boy.
Job kind of sucks,

19:39.134 --> 19:41.354
so at least I get to, uh,
bring him to work.

19:41.397 --> 19:44.618
I'm gonna call my colleague
and see if, um, he has seen

19:44.661 --> 19:47.098
a blind girl,
and you said how many...?

19:47.142 --> 19:48.535
Three.
Three friends?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.363
Three friends.
Yeah, just give me a sec.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.278
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Phone. E-mail. Messaging.

19:52.321 --> 19:55.846
So, my screen's broken,
so I have to use this, uh...

19:55.890 --> 19:59.285
this, uh, dumb robot voice.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.330
Wow, I didn't even know
our phones could do that.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.114
Yeah. Uh, s...

20:03.158 --> 20:04.551
Here we go.[phone chimes]

20:04.594 --> 20:06.988
Um, s... call speed dial one.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

20:09.817 --> 20:12.341
pretty into s-sports,
so just want to make sure

20:12.385 --> 20:15.344
that the-the signal's not
gonna be, uh, in-interrupted.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.824
[cell phone buzzing]For sure.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.434
Excuse me. [chuckles]

20:18.478 --> 20:19.609
Hello.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.395
MURPHY:
Uh, hi. This is Amber calling

20:22.438 --> 20:24.135
from the front desk.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.790
There is a cop here
who's looking for

20:26.834 --> 20:29.793
a blind girl
and three of her friends.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.404
I was just wondering,
did you see anyone

20:31.447 --> 20:32.927
that fits that description?

20:32.970 --> 20:34.755
No, I have not.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.758
Uh, okay, well,
he's going to stick around,

20:37.801 --> 20:40.413
um, so I'll just keep manning
the front desk,

20:40.456 --> 20:42.328
and you just keep doing
what you're doing.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.331
And please alert
the rest of the staff

20:45.374 --> 20:48.856
that he's looking
for an orange, um...

20:48.899 --> 20:51.162
Pontiac Aztek.
Pontiac Aztek.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.339
Okay. Bye.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.428
Seems okay to me.

20:56.429 --> 20:59.214
Good. Uh... sorry.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.479
I just... I have to send my GF
a quick text real quick.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.351
She's getting us food.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.135
She doesn't need you
to go with her?

21:07.178 --> 21:10.051
No, she's a...
independent woman.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.140
Right. Okay, I better go.

21:12.183 --> 21:17.014
No. Uh, actually, would you mind
checking out the hot water?

21:17.058 --> 21:18.451
Oh, my God.[cell phone whooshes]

21:18.494 --> 21:20.757
You are seriously
the most high-maintenance guest

21:20.801 --> 21:22.977
we've ever had.[chuckles]

21:23.020 --> 21:24.283
[exhales]

21:25.849 --> 21:27.460
[phone chimes]

21:29.418 --> 21:31.551
Pull over.
Why?

21:31.594 --> 21:32.943
Because the cops-- the cops

21:32.987 --> 21:34.554
are looking for us
and we have to ditch the car.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.425
No, we're not gonna-- No,
we're not ditching the car.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.297
Okay? We got to meet
there in an hour.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.907
Max, they know what car
we're driving,

21:39.950 --> 21:41.430
so we need to...I don't care if they know!

21:41.474 --> 21:43.258
I need that passport, Jess!

21:43.302 --> 21:44.781
Max, just pull over.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.131
Pull over!MAX: Fine.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.358
JESS:
You check Uber.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.925
I will check cabs.Great.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.492
Uber doesn't even exist here.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.450
Yeah, and the only cab company
is closed until morning.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.539
What?I'll take the car. I don't care.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.846
No, Max, the cops
are looking for it.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.195
[laughs]
No.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.805
I locked the keys in the car.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.677
Best night of my life!Okay.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.679
Just...
Y-You know what?

22:12.722 --> 22:13.897
We'll just hitchhike
there or something.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.203
Um, are you k--
I'm not hitchhiking.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.074
Look, whatever, Jess!

22:17.118 --> 22:18.989
Okay, I'll just go alone. If I
get arrested, I get arrested.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.382
No, Max, please...Don't touch me, Jess!

22:20.426 --> 22:22.036
Okay...
Back away!

22:22.079 --> 22:24.125
[panting]

22:31.915 --> 22:33.439
She said we have
to be there by 9:00.

22:33.482 --> 22:36.485
I don't know
what we're gonna do.Okay, you know what?

22:36.529 --> 22:38.139
Here. Here...

22:38.182 --> 22:40.184
Okay. Um...

22:40.228 --> 22:42.361
You know what? I have a plan.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.058
Okay.

Lefty's Lodge. This is Jason.Hi.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.589
We're on our way to, uh,
pick something up...

22:53.633 --> 22:55.417
From Cindy?
Yes.

22:55.461 --> 22:59.290
Yeah, so, look, we ran into
some car trouble, and it looks

22:59.334 --> 23:01.118
like we're not gonna be
able to make it tonight,

23:01.162 --> 23:02.816
so I was just wondering
if maybe we could...

23:02.859 --> 23:04.600
You can come to my place
in the morning.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.123
I'll text you the address.Great.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.560
Yeah, that's fantastic.
Thank you so much.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.691
We'll see you tomorrow.

23:08.735 --> 23:11.172
Okay, bye.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.533
Um...

23:24.577 --> 23:26.622
Uh, yeah, I saw a
motel a couple...

23:26.666 --> 23:28.232
Yeah. Uh, yeah.Couple miles-- Do
you want to go there?

23:28.276 --> 23:30.713
Yeah. Yeah.Crash in it? Okay.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.802
It was freezing earlier.Yeah.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.284
[faucet squeaks]

23:36.327 --> 23:38.634
Well, it looks like it
magically got fixed.

23:38.678 --> 23:41.811
No, no, no. Don't go.
[chuckles]

23:41.855 --> 23:43.030
Uh...

23:43.073 --> 23:44.858
I know
what you're doing.

23:45.902 --> 23:49.210
I'm not doing
anything. [laughs]

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
sort of freaked out back there.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.192
It's okay.
You don't have to be sorry.

24:15.236 --> 24:18.239
I know that we're not,
like, best friends...

24:18.282 --> 24:20.284
Huh......by any means,

24:20.328 --> 24:22.156
but you can
talk to me.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.027
Even if it's
about Murphy.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.855
No... No, no, it's...It's fine.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.858
It's not about that.
I'm done with Murphy.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.906
[sighs]
The thing is, is I, uh,

24:32.949 --> 24:35.561
I didn't call my dad.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.214
At the gas station.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.086
Who did, who did you call?

24:39.129 --> 24:42.263
No one. Just pretended to.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.700
There's not a
single person

24:44.744 --> 24:46.093
that would even come
looking for me.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.573
That's not true.

24:47.616 --> 24:50.880
Know what? It's, it...
honestly, it's fine,

24:50.924 --> 24:52.360
because I was standing
in that phone booth

24:52.403 --> 24:55.232
realizing that I had
absolutely nobody,

24:55.276 --> 24:56.712
and then I just thought

24:56.756 --> 24:59.410
why am I even mad I'm
throwing this life away?

24:59.454 --> 25:01.587
You know?
Like, I-I should be excited

25:01.630 --> 25:04.546
that I get a chance
to start a new life.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.374
Right?
Yeah.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.595
You deserve that. You really do.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.988
But you know
Murphy does love you.

25:12.032 --> 25:16.471
Jess, I-I... I helped you
bury two bodies

25:16.515 --> 25:18.865
and she dumped me that night.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.478
And you're a good friend to her,
Jess, you know that?

25:24.784 --> 25:27.569
No, no, no,
I'm-I'm serious.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.920
I mean, you of all people
know how selfish she can be,

25:30.964 --> 25:33.401
and you're just,
like, still loyal.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.576
Yeah, I know.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.404
That's just who I am.

25:36.447 --> 25:37.710
You're like me.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.887
You know?
You like to take care of people.

25:40.930 --> 25:44.064
I know. It sucks.

25:44.107 --> 25:47.720
Yes, it does,
but that is why I'm done.You're done?

25:47.763 --> 25:49.286
I'm done.[laughs]Uh-huh.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.897
So you-- did
you see Murphy?

25:50.940 --> 25:54.465
She was like, "So, Max, um...

25:54.509 --> 25:56.859
Let's talk about this.
Let's do this."

25:56.903 --> 25:59.732
And I'm just like...
Just like...I did see-- Yes.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.648
"No. Bye."

26:04.519 --> 26:06.086
It felt so good.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.958
Yeah, that sounds
like heaven.

26:09.002 --> 26:11.352
You should just do it, you know?

26:12.919 --> 26:14.485
The next time she
demands your attention,

26:14.529 --> 26:17.314
just don't
give it to her.

the wait, guys.

something to drink?Um...

Yeah, can I get
a gin and tonic, please?

26:23.059 --> 26:25.714
Sure. And for you?Uh...

26:25.758 --> 26:27.977
Tequila.All right. You got it.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.892
Yeah.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.549
Don't.[both chuckle]

26:34.593 --> 26:36.856
Come on.I didn't-- I didn't
say anything.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.510
You were about to say
something. Yes, you were.Nope, I-- No.

26:39.554 --> 26:44.559
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call,
um, Murphy and Felix

26:44.603 --> 26:47.214
and tell them that we're not
coming back tonight.
