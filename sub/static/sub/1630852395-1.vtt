00:53.208 --> 00:57.958
<i>[narrator]</i> Imagine you're cast at birth
into a galaxy of tiny drifting creatures.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.375
<i>A speck lost in the ocean.</i>

01:09.958 --> 01:12.125
<i>You never met your mother or father.</i>

01:16.291 --> 01:19.416
<i>You have no one to show you</i>
<i>where to go or what to do.</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:26.916
<i>That's how life begins</i>
<i>for this little sharpnose pufferfish.</i>

01:27.625 --> 01:28.625
<i>We'll call him Puff.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:34.916
<i>Just a couple of months old,</i>
<i>he's smaller than a fingernail.</i>

01:35.500 --> 01:39.458
<i>Adrift in the ocean,</i>
<i>headed for an uncertain future.</i>

01:42.250 --> 01:43.958
<i>This is Puff's world.</i>

01:44.041 --> 01:48.458
<i>A vibrant coral reef,</i>
<i>home to thousands of creatures.</i>

01:49.958 --> 01:54.041
<i>But to see what Puff sees,</i>
<i>you have to look closer.</i>

01:56.583 --> 01:58.250
<i>Even closer.</i>

02:03.125 --> 02:07.583
<i>Because the story of every coral reef</i>
<i>starts with its tiniest creatures.</i>

<i>For the first time, we have opened</i>

02:28.541 --> 02:31.916
<i>or too slow for the human eye to perceive.</i>

02:32.916 --> 02:35.416
<i>And from Puff's tiny point of view,</i>

02:35.500 --> 02:37.333
<i>it must seem almost magical.</i>

02:39.625 --> 02:42.708
<i>The reef as we've never seen it before.</i>

<i>[narrator] </i>To the naked eye,

<i>billions of tiny creatures are revealed.</i>

03:16.791 --> 03:19.541
<i>Some so minute</i>
<i>that hundreds of individuals</i>

<i>would fit in a single drop of water.</i>

<i>This is where Puff</i>
<i>begins his life journey.</i>

03:30.833 --> 03:34.958
<i>He hatched from an egg on the reef</i>
<i>and drifted with the current out to sea,</i>

03:35.041 --> 03:37.083
<i>to feed on tiny plankton.</i>

03:40.416 --> 03:43.041
<i>This is how many reef fish</i>

03:44.208 --> 03:46.083
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

<i>[narrator] </i>But within months,

04:14.583 --> 04:17.041
<i>He needs to find bigger things to eat.</i>

04:18.583 --> 04:21.208
<i>And that poses a problem</i>

04:22.375 --> 04:25.166
<i>How will Puff find his way back</i>

04:36.375 --> 04:40.708

04:41.458 --> 04:42.666
<i>Crowds make noise,</i>

07:26.000 --> 07:27.666
<i>That's not just daunting,</i>

07:28.541 --> 07:29.750
<i>it's dangerous.</i>

07:32.208 --> 07:36.916
<i>Fortunately for Puff, he has</i>
<i>an ingenious way of defending himself.</i>

07:38.916 --> 07:40.041
<i>He's toxic.</i>

07:40.916 --> 07:42.916
<i>And he comes with a warning label.</i>

07:44.083 --> 07:46.000
<i>The markings on his body say,</i>

07:46.583 --> 07:48.666
<i>"Eat me, and you'll regret it."</i>

07:55.291 --> 07:58.166
<i>But being poisonous</i>
<i>doesn't make him invincible.</i>

08:05.041 --> 08:07.458
<i>And nearby, a predator lurks.</i>

08:18.500 --> 08:19.875
<i>A lionfish.</i>

08:29.750 --> 08:32.333
<i>This ferocious hunter's dazzling fins</i>

<i>[suspenseful music playing]</i>

09:58.083 --> 09:59.375
<i>[narrator] </i>Every year,

<i>that tonight is the night</i>
<i>to cast the young to the sea.</i>

10:17.000 --> 10:19.375
<i>At the mouths of tiny coral polyps,</i>

10:19.458 --> 10:22.708
<i>minuscule bundles</i>
<i>of eggs and sperm appear.</i>

10:30.208 --> 10:33.916
<i>In near perfect synchronicity,</i>
<i>they lift off…</i>

<i>and journey to the surface.</i>

10:46.250 --> 10:49.208
<i>The bundles drift with the current</i>
<i>and mix with the spawn</i>

<i>of thousands of other coral colonies.</i>

<i>If among the billions of eggs</i>

11:26.750 --> 11:29.208
<i>something extraordinary happens.</i>

11:32.583 --> 11:34.791
<i>A microscopic larva forms,</i>

11:35.291 --> 11:39.416
<i>a barely visible creature</i>
<i>on a quest to build a new coral colony.</i>

11:42.416 --> 11:44.250
<i>It drifts for days</i>

11:45.750 --> 11:48.125
<i>until it hears the call of the reef.</i>

11:49.416 --> 11:50.750
<i>And dives,</i>

11:53.625 --> 11:56.583
<i>braving a minefield</i>
<i>of predators and traps.</i>

12:11.875 --> 12:13.666
<i>[sinister music playing]</i>

12:31.916 --> 12:34.166
<i>[narrator]</i>
When you're the size of a speck,

<i>a three-centimeter-long shrimp</i>
<i>can be monstrous.</i>

12:48.416 --> 12:50.166
<i>[eerie music playing]</i>

13:29.958 --> 13:34.291
<i>[narrator] </i>On the reef, the larva searches

13:44.833 --> 13:46.583
<i>When it finds the right spot,</i>

13:47.083 --> 13:48.375
<i>it transforms</i>

13:49.541 --> 13:53.000
<i>from a free-swimming larva</i>
<i>into a young coral.</i>

13:54.916 --> 13:58.375
<i>As it grows,</i>
<i>its skeleton forms part of the reef.</i>

14:00.958 --> 14:03.625
<i>With the help</i>
<i>of other tiny construction workers,</i>

14:03.708 --> 14:05.625
<i>the corals build living structures</i>

14:05.708 --> 14:08.791
<i>that create homes</i>
<i>for countless other creatures.</i>

14:10.000 --> 14:12.791
<i>It takes hundreds,</i>
<i>sometimes thousands of years,</i>

14:12.875 --> 14:18.083
<i>for generations of tiny reef-builders</i>
<i>to construct Puff's coral metropolis.</i>

14:33.458 --> 14:37.041
<i>Inside his reef hiding place,</i>
<i>Puff is safe for now.</i>

14:38.083 --> 14:41.708
<i>But he needs to brave the predators</i>
<i>and head out to find food.</i>

14:47.041 --> 14:49.333
<i>And once again, the corals help out.</i>

14:50.916 --> 14:54.708
<i>Because corals produce energy</i>
<i>that feeds the animals of the reef.</i>

14:58.625 --> 15:01.583
<i>It all starts with single-celled,</i>
<i>plant-like creatures</i>

15:01.666 --> 15:04.250
<i>living within the corals,</i>
<i>the zooxanthellae.</i>

15:05.791 --> 15:07.625
<i>Don't let that big name fool you.</i>

15:08.875 --> 15:11.750
<i>Everything here, really small.</i>

15:13.666 --> 15:16.250
<i>These little guys</i>
<i>are the coral's life partners,</i>

15:17.041 --> 15:20.750
<i>harvesting energy from sunlight</i>
<i>to feed their coral hosts.</i>

15:21.666 --> 15:23.833
<i>And as the corals grow and thrive,</i>

15:24.416 --> 15:27.333
<i>they share their energy</i>
<i>with the rest of the reef.</i>

15:32.875 --> 15:37.250
<i>Some creatures consume the energy directly</i>
<i>by eating the coral.</i>

15:40.208 --> 15:42.750
<i>This baby crown-of-thorns starfish</i>

15:42.833 --> 15:47.958
<i>uses tiny eyespots on the end</i>
<i>of each arm to locate coral colonies.</i>

15:53.208 --> 15:57.250
<i>A keen sense of underwater smell</i>
<i>helps it find the right species.</i>

16:01.625 --> 16:05.833
<i>And it devours the coral polyps,</i>
<i>leaving a scar on the reef.</i>

16:13.541 --> 16:16.291
<i>Not all inhabitants</i>
<i>feed on the coral directly.</i>

16:17.958 --> 16:20.875
<i>If they did,</i>
<i>they'd soon demolish their reef city.</i>

16:22.583 --> 16:25.916
<i>Fortunately, there's another way</i>
<i>corals supply food.</i>

16:27.916 --> 16:30.208
<i>They do it with slime.</i>

16:39.541 --> 16:43.458
<i>Corals shed mucus too fine</i>
<i>for creatures like Puff to eat,</i>

16:45.791 --> 16:50.500
<i>but an ancient group of organisms</i>
<i>makes sure this energy is not lost.</i>

16:52.500 --> 16:54.000
<i>Sponges.</i>

16:55.500 --> 16:58.208
<i>To the naked eye,</i>
<i>they may appear motionless,</i>

16:58.291 --> 17:02.416
<i>but if you speed up time,</i>
<i>their vital role in the reef is revealed.</i>

17:07.875 --> 17:11.916
<i>Sponges pump huge volumes of water</i>
<i>through their bodies,</i>

17:12.000 --> 17:16.291
<i>filtering out the coral mucus</i>
<i>and using the energy to grow.</i>

17:16.375 --> 17:18.083
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

17:25.833 --> 17:27.750
<i>[narrator]</i> After they've had their fill,

<i>the sponges concentrate organic waste</i>
<i>on their surfaces,</i>

17:32.083 --> 17:33.916
<i>creating a bite-sized buffet</i>

17:34.000 --> 17:36.083
<i>for tiny creatures to feed on.</i>

17:43.875 --> 17:47.291
<i>And those animals</i>
<i>are eaten by slightly bigger creatures.</i>

17:49.083 --> 17:52.666
<i>Oh no. No, no, no. Just slightly bigger?</i>
<i>No, that's</i>…<i> That's way too big.</i>

17:52.750 --> 17:54.250
<i>That's huge. That's massive.</i>

17:54.333 --> 17:55.500
<i>This… yes.</i>

17:55.583 --> 17:56.500
<i>That's better.</i>

18:01.458 --> 18:05.166
<i>Some of the recycled sponge food</i>
<i>also washes up the water column</i>

18:05.666 --> 18:08.708
<i>where it's captured and consumed</i>
<i>by filter feeders.</i>

18:09.416 --> 18:11.125
<i>Like the Christmas tree worm.</i>
