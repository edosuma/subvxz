Everybody Hates Chris #024
Closed Captioned

00:02.636 --> 00:05.573
CHRIS ROCK:
Keisha was the first girl
I ever really cared about.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.741
Even though she never
really cared about me.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.643
When I found out her family
was moving,

00:09.677 --> 00:11.545
I was sad to see her go.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.547
Hey, where y'all
moving to?

00:13.581 --> 00:15.183
We're going to this place
in California.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.750
It's supposed to be
really, really nice.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.619
Palm trees and lawns

00:18.652 --> 00:20.054
and no violence
and no crime.

00:20.088 --> 00:23.091
Well, what's it called?
Compton.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.393
I always wondered how that
worked out for them?

00:25.426 --> 00:26.527
MAN:
Bust a cap in 'em!

00:26.560 --> 00:29.197
MAN:
Get down, Keisha!
Get down, girl, get down!

00:29.230 --> 00:30.764
So do you
miss Keisha?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.766
Do you mean do I miss being
rejected, ignored

00:32.800 --> 00:33.767
and humiliated?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.369
Yeah, sort of.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.338
Why don't you just
hang out with
somebody else?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.307
I don't like
anyone else.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.676
And nobody else
liked me.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.812
Hey, who's that?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.850
That's just Yvette.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.652
She lives
around the corner.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.654
You know, she's
kind of cute.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.524
Man, you don't want
to mess with her.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.658
The first girl you ever like

00:57.691 --> 00:59.193
is always tough
to get over.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.828
She holds a special place
in your heart.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.697
So I decided to lower
my standards.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.666
I heard she'll go out
with anybody.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.301
Really?

01:07.335 --> 01:10.204
Now that's my kind of girl.

01:10.238 --> 01:14.142

01:19.580 --> 01:21.182
* Oh... make it funky now!

01:43.371 --> 01:45.339
Since I didn't want to make
the same mistakes with Yvette

01:45.373 --> 01:47.508
that I made with Keisha,
I needed a different approach.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.809
What do you know about her?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.711
Nothing much. Just that she's
supposed to go out

01:50.744 --> 01:52.413
with a lot of different
types of guys.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.148
Perfect.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.616
You should do something simple.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.584
Something you haven't
tried before.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.886
I can't just walk up to her
and ask her out.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.254
Have you tried it?

02:00.288 --> 02:01.589
Not yet.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.191
The worst she can say is no.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.826
Okay then, let's try it.
Try what?

02:05.859 --> 02:07.561
You'll be Yvette
and I'll ask you out.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.729
Brokeback Hallway.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.863
Right here?

02:09.897 --> 02:10.864
It was your idea.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.200
You going to help me
or not?

02:12.233 --> 02:14.335
Fine. Hurry up.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.869
:
Hey, Yvette.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.939
So, you want to go out
with me sometime...?

02:18.972 --> 02:22.243
No, you skinny black bum.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.613
I thought the worst
you could say was no.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.815
I was improvising.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.450
Well, you know, since you're
making stuff up

02:29.483 --> 02:30.451
couldn't you have said yes?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.785
He wasn't my type anyway.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.787
We had only been living

02:33.821 --> 02:35.956
in Bed-Stuy for a year
when the crime rate

02:35.989 --> 02:37.525
started to go through the roof.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.960
In the late '90s,
they had the Internet boom,

02:39.993 --> 02:41.962
but in the '80s,
we had the crack boom.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.233
It used to take years
to become a junkie,

02:45.266 --> 02:47.368
but crack cut that down
to 37 minutes.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.636
Even on my block,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.838
things were starting
to get out of control.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.340
The muggers
were getting mugged.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.408
Let me hold a quarter.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.777
What's up, little man?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.846
Let me hold a
dollar right quick.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.781
I'll take that
quarter, too.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.950
But...

03:02.983 --> 03:04.918
Our new next door neighbor
was Louise Clarkson.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.387
She hated our neighborhood,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.389
and was intent
on doing something about it.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.491
Well, I can see
we're both very busy,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.393
so I'll just get
to the point.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.795
I'm starting a
neighborhood block watch.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.697
Why do we need
a block watch?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.400
In case you
haven't noticed,

03:19.433 --> 03:21.402
crime is running rampant
in this neighborhood.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.670
No, it's not.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.537
This block is fine.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.006
Burglaries are up,
assaults, murders.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.008
Is that fine?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.311
I don't know what block,
you've been on,

03:30.344 --> 03:33.547
but this block is okay,
but thank you for stopping by.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.748
Well, thank you.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.016
Uh, something on your teeth.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.418
I'll see myself out.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.586
:
Okay.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.753
Love the couch.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.457
Neighborhood block watch.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.494
My mother didn't want to accept
that things were getting worse

03:46.527 --> 03:47.895
until something happened to us.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.530
JULIUS:
Rochelle!

03:49.563 --> 03:51.499
What? I'm in here.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.000
My truck got stolen!

03:53.033 --> 03:54.968
What?! Oh, no!

03:55.002 --> 03:56.570
I could get fired for this.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.905
Well, baby, are you sure
it's stolen?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.039
Maybe you just forgot

03:59.072 --> 04:00.374
where you
parked it.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.842
Rochelle, it's not keys,
it's a truck.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.611
Even if I forgot
where I parked it,

04:03.644 --> 04:05.579
you can still see it,
'cause it's a truck!

04:05.613 --> 04:07.281
Well, don't get mad at me.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.849
You act like I stole it.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.452
That's it. I'm
starting a block watch.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.321
That sounds like a good idea.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.723
As soon as I finish this toe.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.326
My mother was a ghetto snob,
so to her,

04:18.359 --> 04:20.561
this wasn't just
a block watch meeting.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.730
It was a Rochelle watch
meeting.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.997
What's all this?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.066
Food for the block
watch meeting.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.901
You're supposed
to be watching the block,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.269
not feeding it.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.839
Julius, I can't
invite people over here
without feeding them.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.774
People in my neighborhood
never got together

04:33.807 --> 04:35.609
without bringing food.

04:35.643 --> 04:40.047
Oh, I am so sorry
you got run over by a truck.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.982
But I brought you some ribs.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.386
My baby! They
killed my baby.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.388
I'm sorry about your baby.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.789
Catfish?

04:48.822 --> 04:51.425
And besides, how do
you expect people

04:51.459 --> 04:52.960
to fight crime when
they're hungry?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.996
How do you expect me to
feed people when I'm broke?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.431
Huh
Um...

04:57.465 --> 04:59.066
:
You smell smoke?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.068
Asking Greg out was one thing,

05:01.101 --> 05:02.836
but Yvette was
a wholenother story.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.405
When you ask a girl out,

05:04.438 --> 05:05.939
you've got to have
your game together.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.075
Chris, look, a woman
got a lot of choices,

05:08.108 --> 05:09.843
so you got to show her something

05:09.877 --> 05:11.912
that separates you
from the other guys.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.681
Mm-hmm.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.083
Well, I've got the perfect thing
for you-- Drakkar Noir.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.018
Drives the ladies wild.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.387
Four dollars.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.054
You can't sell that
in here.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.656
Why not?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.825
'Cause I'll break
your other arm.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.862
Here, try this one.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.369
Yeah. That's just
five dollars.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.070
F... Five...?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.975
Oh, oh, here come
your lady, young blood.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.811
See you later, okay?
Okay.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.854
* Hey, lady...

05:53.887 --> 05:56.957
Um, you're
Yvette, right?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.426
I'm Chris.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.861
Hi. What's that smell?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.796
That's my cologne.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.164
That's nice.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.165
CHRIS:
Thanks.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.701
Well, you know, I've seen
you around the block

06:07.735 --> 06:09.470
and thought you
were kind of cute.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.071
Thank you.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.074
So, I was wondering if maybe
you can go out this weekend?

06:14.107 --> 06:15.476
Go out?

06:15.509 --> 06:18.078
Yeah, to the movies
or something.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.413
You paying?

06:19.447 --> 06:20.581
I've seen that look before.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.115
It usually led to this.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.754
Wait. What do you want
to go and do this for

06:28.021 --> 06:29.089
Okay.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.791
I said this...

06:30.824 --> 06:32.192
All right, then.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.027
...but I felt like this.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.540
CHRIS ROCK:
The toughest part
about getting a block watch

06:46.574 --> 06:48.442
was finding people
who had stuff worth watching.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.010
All right, now, the
most important part

06:50.043 --> 06:51.545
of the Block
Watch program is

06:51.579 --> 06:52.813
communication.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.149
So if you see
anything, you have

06:56.183 --> 06:58.151
to file a report.

06:58.185 --> 07:02.089
Without information, not a
lot your local police can do.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.825
Okay, well, what type
of information?

07:04.858 --> 07:08.629
Like if you see somebody
stealing my couch, tell me.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.063
Excuse me.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.633
Translation--
"What you say, heifer?"

07:12.666 --> 07:14.167
Excuse me? Excuse you.
Who are you?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.869
Who are you?
Oh, girl,
that's Louise.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.138
She just moved in next d...
I beg your pardon.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.172
I'm sitting
right here.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.541
I'm Louise.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.075
I just moved in next door,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.244
and this was my idea.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.515
By the way, in my
old neighborhood,

07:27.548 --> 07:28.849
we didn't have
these problems.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.050
She told her.

07:30.083 --> 07:30.984
Where are you from?

07:31.018 --> 07:31.985
Queens.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.821
Oh, Queens.
Very lovely there.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.723
Mm-hmm.
Do you know the Jacobsons?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.491
The black Jacobs?
No the white ones.

07:37.525 --> 07:38.659
The ones with
the restaurant?

07:38.692 --> 07:39.960
Yeah.
I love that...

07:39.993 --> 07:42.763
Excuse me, can we talk about
this neighborhood, Brooklyn?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.998
POLICEMAN:
All right.
Touchy.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.634
Now, what's
very important,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.268
also, in the Block
Watch program is,

07:48.301 --> 07:50.203
if you are away from your house

07:50.237 --> 07:51.972
for any extended period
of time...

07:52.005 --> 07:53.741
In Bed-Stuy, that's 12 minutes.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.544
...you must alert
the other Block Watch members.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.546
And they will watch
your property.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.179
POLICEMAN:
Correct.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.214
Nicely done.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.284
Like let's say
one of you is

08:04.317 --> 08:05.553
on your way
to Florida...

08:05.586 --> 08:06.687
Florida?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.689
The closest my family came
to Florida was watching

08:08.722 --> 08:09.957
Esther Rolle on Good Times.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.191
:
Now I get it.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.961
Then the rest of us
can watch out for their house.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.863
I'll take the
night shift.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.966
POLICEMAN:
All right. Another
very important part

08:18.999 --> 08:20.568
of a Block Watch program is...

08:20.601 --> 08:22.135
awareness, huh?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.837
And that's why

08:23.871 --> 08:25.072
you have these.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.041
These are stickers, and these
are gonna go in your window.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.778
These stickers will be seen
by the offenders,

08:30.811 --> 08:33.781
and then they will be
less likely to offend.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.982
You mean steal?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.617
Correct. Nicely done.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.585
Well, why she
get a button...?

08:37.618 --> 08:41.188
Stickers? You think
that's gonna keep people

08:41.221 --> 08:44.191
from coming into the house
and hitting me over the head,

08:44.224 --> 08:46.560
'cause I got a sticker
in the window?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.161
:
If she wasn't so damn evil,

08:48.195 --> 08:50.831
nobody would be trying
to hit her over the head.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.065
Excuse me?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.867
You're excused.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.903
POLICEMAN:
All right, now,
you need to elect

08:55.936 --> 08:57.137
a Block Watch captain.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.206
Okay. All right.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.710
I think I should be the
Block Watch captain.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.744
And why is that?

09:03.777 --> 09:04.878
Well, because I'm the only one

09:04.912 --> 09:06.279
on the block who
doesn't need watching.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.948
No. It was my husband's truck
that got stolen.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.216
Yes, well, if
you had done

09:09.249 --> 09:12.319
what I asked you to do, which
was start the neighborhood...

09:12.352 --> 09:14.655
See, the problem is, you're new
to the neighborhood, okay?
All right, okay...

09:14.688 --> 09:17.157
So, I don't know
how they do it in Queens...

09:17.190 --> 09:18.926
You're just serving...
but we do it in...

09:18.959 --> 09:20.360
Whoa, ladies,
ladies, ladies,

09:20.393 --> 09:22.362
ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies...

09:22.395 --> 09:23.697
Mm-hmm.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.232
Let's put it to a vote.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.100
Please.
POLICEMAN:
Okay.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.235
Who made the pie?
I did.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.738
I nominate Rochelle to be
the first Block Watch captain.

09:30.771 --> 09:34.141
Uh-uh, no. You cannot nominate
because she made some pie.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.008
It's some good pie.

09:35.042 --> 09:35.876
Shut up.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.978
All right, all in favor?
You like my pie?

09:38.011 --> 09:40.013
ALL EXCEPT LOUISE:
Aye.
The ayes have it.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.083
I came up
with this idea.

09:43.116 --> 09:47.087
I don't see why I am not
the Block Watch captain.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.023
Because we voted,
and the pie lady won.
Okay, fine.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.960
Now when you all come
home to your apartments,

09:52.993 --> 09:54.194
and there's nothing there

09:54.227 --> 09:56.329
except a pie, we all
know who to talk to--

09:56.363 --> 09:58.799
the Block Watch
captain, and we'll say,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.300
"Where were you,
Block Watch Captain?"

10:00.333 --> 10:02.035
She'll say, "I've
been making pie."

10:02.069 --> 10:03.003
I do not talk like that.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.873
Okay, okay,
any questions, any questions?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.074
I have one.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.075
So, what type of places

10:08.108 --> 10:10.277
would you consider
to be the most vulnerable?

10:10.310 --> 10:13.280
Like, say an offender
was gonna break into
somebody's house.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.082
Who would be
the best victim?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.283
That's a very good question.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.284
No, it's not.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.853
You just break into a house
where nobody's home.

10:19.887 --> 10:20.821
That's right.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.055
Cool.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.657
I got to go.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.626
:
Oh!

10:26.660 --> 10:29.863
With a four second head start,
Jerome stole four stereos.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.766
My mother wasn't the only one
helping out the community.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.368
At school, Drew volunteered
to be a Patrol Boy,

10:35.402 --> 10:38.005
which is just a fancy name
for crossing guard.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.372
Okay, go.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.679
Hey, Drew, can you
help me cross?

10:45.713 --> 10:46.980
Sure.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.148
Thanks, Drew.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.785
If this had been me,
here's how it would have gone.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.456
Because I was going on a date
for the first time,

10:56.489 --> 10:58.692
everyone had
a helpful suggestion.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.327
Be sure to compliment her
on her shoes.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.162
Girls like that.
Shoes, right.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.364
Tell her you got a job.
Girls like that more.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.598
Job, I got it.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.235
And hold a piece of gum under
your tongue and let it soak

11:08.268 --> 11:09.436
so your breath won't stink.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.005
Okay, gum.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.241
Oh, yeah, and if the movie
is sad, don't cry.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.275
She'll think you're a punk.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.409
It's Footloose.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.211
I ain't gonna cry.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.147
Oh, baby, have a good time.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.481
But not too good a time,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.383
'cause you know I'm not raising
no babies.

11:23.416 --> 11:27.087
Enjoy yourself.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.724
This is half off on a soda
and box of Jujubes.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.259
Thanks.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.161
Oh, what the hell.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.430
Here's a coupon
for a free box of popcorn.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.768
The last time my father
gave man an extra coupon

11:40.801 --> 11:41.869
was when I gave him

11:41.902 --> 11:45.272
a get-one coupon,
get-one-coupon-free coupon.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.439
Have a good time.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.440
You look good, man.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.276
That's my boy.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.044
Standing there waiting
for Yvette

11:51.078 --> 11:53.180
was one of the best feelings
I'd had.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.348
But after 15 minutes,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.818
I thought, "Maybe the buses
are running late."

11:57.851 --> 12:04.024
After 30 minutes, I thought,
"Maybe the bus broke down."

12:04.057 --> 12:05.458
After an hour, I thought,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.227
"Maybe the bus got
in an accident,

12:07.260 --> 12:10.063
"skidded through the guardrail,
exploded in midair,

12:10.097 --> 12:13.200
and ended up at the bottom
of the East River."

12:13.233 --> 12:14.835
After the movie was over,

12:14.868 --> 12:18.806
I thought, "Maybe she never got
on that bus at all."

12:18.839 --> 12:20.941
To this day, I can't make it
through Footloose

12:20.974 --> 12:23.143
without crying.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.448
That's a bummer, man.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.950
Did she say
what happened?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.251
I haven't heard
from her.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.953
Why do girls
do junk like that?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.287
I don't know
what to tell you.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.257
Greg and I had the same
conversation last night

12:37.290 --> 12:39.159
and he still didn't know
what to tell me.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.128
That sucks.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.430
Man, I don't know
how you made it
to school today.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.899
Stood up, out there
on the street,

12:45.933 --> 12:46.967
talk about embarrassing.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.501
If I were you,
I'd be so depressed,

12:48.535 --> 12:50.437
I'd be standing on top
of the Brooklyn Bridge

12:50.470 --> 12:52.405
with a hundred pounds of
rocks tied around my ankles

12:52.439 --> 12:54.174
and a bag of rats
wrapped around my head,

12:54.207 --> 12:55.242
ready to jump...

12:55.275 --> 12:57.344
Okay, I get it.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.245
Forget about it, man.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.179
You're a nice guy.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.313
Aren't you the same one

13:00.347 --> 13:01.982
who called me
a little black bum?

13:02.015 --> 13:04.852
Like I said,
I was improvising.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.454
If it makes you
feel any better,
I would have shown up.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.122
That didn't mean anything.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.324
Greg once showed up at
a sneaker-string taste test.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.063
Uh-huh. Hey!

13:16.096 --> 13:17.164
I'm watching you!

13:17.197 --> 13:20.000
Because my mother
was the Block Watch captain,

13:20.033 --> 13:21.969
if anything happened
in the neighborhood,

13:22.002 --> 13:23.803
Miss Louise made sure
she heard about it.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.008
They're spraying graffiti
downstairs.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.509
I'll file a report.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.544
There's a mad dog chasing
people!

13:31.578 --> 13:33.213
I'll file a report.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.982
Somebody stole my mail.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.483
I'll file a report.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.385
I can't find my glasses.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.020
I'll file a report.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.855
Larry and them coming.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.024
I'll file a report.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.059
Being stood up was bad enough,

13:46.093 --> 13:47.560
so I didn't want
to tell anybody.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.431
Hey.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.566
Listen, you ever hear
of Whodini?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.302
Ecstasy and Jalil? Yeah.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.570
Yeah, I got a couple of tickets.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.874
I thought the show
was about the magician.

14:00.908 --> 14:01.942
You want 'em?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.576
Yeah.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.978
Maybe you can take your girl.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.246
I don't think so.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.114
Why not?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.181
She stood me up.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.051
I was standing outside
the theater for two hours

14:11.084 --> 14:12.019
and she never showed up.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.987
What? You gonna let her
treat you that way

14:14.021 --> 14:14.988
and get away with it?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.390
Listen, if I was you,
I'd go find that girl,

14:17.424 --> 14:19.326
take her by the hair
and shake her

14:19.359 --> 14:21.161
like an Etch-A-Sketch.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.462
Doc lives alone.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.331
She does owe me an explanation.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
Now you're talking.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.068
Well, here's your chance.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.437
Hey, Chris.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.974
Oh, hey, what happened
to you yesterday?

14:34.007 --> 14:36.643
That's right. We were supposed
to go see Footloose.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.611
I totally forgot.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.680
I didn't know it then,
but, for years to come,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.615
I dated an awful lot
of women with amnesia.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.052
Oh, that's right.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.920
We're supposed
to go to the prom together.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.421
I totally forgot.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.656
That's right.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.624
We wer supposed to do something
for your birthday.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.226
Totally forgot.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.327
Oh, that's right.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.628
I was supposed to give you
a kidney.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.564
Boy, I forgot all about you.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.266
Until I got famous,

14:59.299 --> 15:01.601
I never met a woman
that could remember anything.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.337
So maybe we can
go Saturday.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.139
Mm, this Saturday?

15:06.173 --> 15:08.175
I can't.
I have a piano lesson.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.309
Are you free Sunday?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.677
I have to go clean house.

15:10.710 --> 15:14.147
Too bad. I got these
Whodini tickets

15:14.181 --> 15:15.648
for Sunday afternoon
at the park.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.250
For real?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.486
Yeah, right here.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.487
You know what?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.622
Maybe I can go.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.026
So I'll see you Sunday then?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.494
All right.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.296
Sunday.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.434
Mm-mm.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.668
What?

15:35.702 --> 15:38.105
That girl is not interested
in you.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.272
She's interested
in your tickets.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.342
Think so?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.276
She's an opportunist.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.679
She goes with whoever
has the best deal.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.448
She only agreed
to go out with you

15:48.481 --> 15:50.150
because she didn't have
anything better to do.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.053
That's how I ended up
married for three years.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.022
I don't Yvette's like that.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.389
Want to make a bet?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.394
While I was trying
to get a girl's attention,

16:01.428 --> 16:04.164
girls were trying to get
Drew's attention.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.565
I feel so safe
with you here.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.366
Thanks.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.567
Drew,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.670
this is all for you.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.072
What are you doing?

16:13.306 --> 16:13.673
Drew.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.442
Drew.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.743
Oh, man!

16:18.578 --> 16:20.347
Drew's corner was crawling
with more girls

16:20.380 --> 16:21.514
than Usher's garbage can.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.084
I didn't want to believe Doc
was right about Yvette,

16:24.117 --> 16:26.086
so I decided to see for myself.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.455
Hey, Yvette. Yeah, it's Chris.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.289
Hi.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.125
Listen, about those tickets,
yeah.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.360
I found out they were fake.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.527
For real?

16:34.561 --> 16:37.264
Mm...
But you know, we can still
go out to a movie.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.066
Yeah, I found out
there's this new movie...

16:40.100 --> 16:43.203
Hello

16:50.810 --> 16:53.713
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.517
Hmm, maybe a bus crashed
into her phone.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.187
Rochelle.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.221
Yes, Louise.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.090
I need stickers.
What?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.093
Stickers. I've been up
and down this block.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.328
I've looked in every window
and there are no stickers.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.064
How do we expect offenders
not to offend

17:11.098 --> 17:12.465
if there are no stickers?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.601
I'll get you
some stickers, Louise.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.435
Thank you.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.469
Whoa, whoa, baby,

17:16.503 --> 17:19.139
that's nine cent
worth of tape.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.341
Hi, Julius.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.243
So sorry about your truck.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.512
I can't believe they stole it
right off the street.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.646
It was right here.

17:26.679 --> 17:30.217
Right here?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.218
Right here.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.720
Next to the fire hydrant?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.789
Oh.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.461
They must have
just put that there.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.730
Well, it probably
wouldn't have happened

17:43.763 --> 17:47.200
if it had had
a sticker on it.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.671
I like her.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.206
What?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.608
Matches...

17:55.642 --> 17:57.510
Hey, Chris.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.412
Hey, can I talk
to your for a minute?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.448
I hope she doesn't have
something better to do.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.152
What?

18:05.185 --> 18:06.353
How come you
didn't tell me

18:06.386 --> 18:07.687
you just didn't want
to go out with me

18:07.720 --> 18:08.788
instead of dissing
me like that?

18:08.821 --> 18:10.423
Like what?

18:10.457 --> 18:11.824
Like leaving me
out in front

18:11.858 --> 18:13.360
of the movie theater
like a fool.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.495
Like saying you want
to go with me to go see

18:15.528 --> 18:16.829
Whodini then hanging up
in my face?

18:16.863 --> 18:18.298
You said the tickets
were fake.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.399
I thought
you were going

18:19.432 --> 18:21.368
because you wanted
to go out with me.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.171
Why'd you even agree
to go out with me
in the first place?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.838
Because I didn't have
anything better to do.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.540
Why didn't you
say that?

18:27.574 --> 18:30.277
I was trying
not to hurt your feelings.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.245
Well, you know,
you really suck at that.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.214
Well, what do you
want me to do?

18:36.383 --> 18:40.520
You know what?
Nothing.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.222
I asked Yvette out
after I got famous.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.191
She stood me up and went out
with Chris Tucker.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.394
You handled that like a man,
Chris.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.862
You still got those tickets?

18:49.896 --> 18:51.564
Yeah. Why?

18:51.598 --> 18:55.835
I got this young honey
on the line and she loves rap.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.205
Have fun.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.208
You know I will.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.943
Man, the first time I asked
a girl to go out with me

19:03.976 --> 19:05.678
and this happens.

19:05.712 --> 19:09.282
Hey, at least it ended
better than this.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.786
After a week of being captain
of the Block Watch,

19:13.820 --> 19:16.256
my mother was going down
with the ship.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.624
I heard a noise in my house.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.726
I heard a noise
in my house, too,

19:19.759 --> 19:21.394
and it's you
at my damn door!

19:21.428 --> 19:24.231
Well, you are
the Block Watch captain.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.334
No, no, I'm not. You win!
You win!

19:27.367 --> 19:29.502
Here, here, you want to be
the Block Watch captain,

19:29.536 --> 19:31.638
be the Block Watch captain.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.673
Well, only if you're
absolutely sure.

19:35.808 --> 19:41.381
Here's the rest of the piece
of the pie!

19:41.414 --> 19:43.850
All right, we gonna see
who's watching the block now.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.419
What are you doing?

19:46.453 --> 19:49.322
I'm quitting the Patrol Boys.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.390
Why?

19:50.423 --> 19:51.991
Girls are crazy.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.262
No truer words
have ever been spoken.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.697
After getting put down
by Keisha

19:57.730 --> 19:58.998
and stood up by Yvette,

19:59.031 --> 20:01.768
I was through having crushes
on girls in the neighborhood,

20:01.801 --> 20:03.636
and I meant it.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.972
Oh, hi. You must be Chris.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.640
Uh, scratch that.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.942
Hey. Who are you?

20:09.976 --> 20:13.680
I'm Tasha.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.849
Stay away from my granddaughter,
you cockeyed hooligan.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.420
Turns out older women
didn't like me either.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.690
* Everybody hates Chris.
