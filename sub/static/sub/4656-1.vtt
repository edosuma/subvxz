01:59.328 --> 02:02.372
I would like to say
a few words about weddings.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.458
I've just been through one.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.002
Not my own, my daughter's.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.755
Someday in the far future...

02:09.963 --> 02:14.510
...I may be able to remember it
with tender indulgence, but not now.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.972
I always used to think that
marriage was a simple affair.

02:19.139 --> 02:24.144
Boy and girl meet, they fall in love,
get married, they have babies...

02:24.311 --> 02:27.105
...eventually the babies
grow up, meet other babies...

02:27.272 --> 02:31.485
...they fall in love and get married,
and so on and on and on.

02:32.194 --> 02:36.240
Looked at that way, it's not only
simple, it's downright monotonous.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.993
But I was wrong.
I figured without the wedding.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.664
Now, you fathers will understand.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.042
You have a little girl.
She looks up to you.

02:47.209 --> 02:50.003
You're her oracle. You're her hero.

02:50.963 --> 02:55.759
Then the day comes when she gets her first
permanent wave and goes to her first party.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.805
And from that day on,
you're in a constant state of panic.

03:00.347 --> 03:04.893
If the boys swarm around, you're in
a panic for fear she'll marry one of them.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.605
If they don't swarm around,
you're in another kind of a panic...

03:08.772 --> 03:11.275
...and you wonder
what's the matter with her.

03:13.861 --> 03:18.615
So you don't worry about it. You say,
I've got plenty of time to worry about that.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.577
I'll just put off thinking about it.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.788
And then suddenly it is upon you.

03:26.832 --> 03:30.294
It was just three months ago,
exactly three months ago...

03:30.460 --> 03:35.340
...that the storm broke here. It was an
ordinary day, very much like any other day.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.178
I had caught the commuters'
train home, as usual.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.180
It was late, as usual.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.144
<i>We own our own home in the suburbs.
At least, we almost own it.</i>

03:47.352 --> 03:50.898
<i>Had it built when my law firm
made me a full-fledged partner.</i>

03:51.440 --> 03:54.818
<i>As usual, it was Ellie who was
the first to greet me.</i>

03:54.943 --> 03:59.531
<i>She asked me what kind of a day I'd had and
I asked her what kind of a day she'd had.</i>

03:59.698 --> 04:02.743
<i>And our Delilah,
she was always the same.</i>

04:03.827 --> 04:07.039
<i>Another kitchen crisis,
but that's routine.</i>

04:09.625 --> 04:11.376
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

04:11.502 --> 04:14.296
- May I have the keys to the car?
- Yeah. Be careful.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.672
Okay.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.423
Good night.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.676
<i>As usual, Ben wanted the car.</i>

04:19.843 --> 04:23.931
<i>Ben's a nice, steady boy in college,
studying engineering.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:25.349
Hi, Pop.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.975
Hi.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.352
<i>And Tommy.</i>

04:28.560 --> 04:31.730
<i>No worry about him
except to try to keep him fed.</i>

04:32.856 --> 04:37.402
<i>It was hi and goodbye that night,
but I'm used to that.</i>

04:37.569 --> 04:41.615
<i>I was wondering if my daughter had
deserted us too when I heard her voice.</i>

04:41.740 --> 04:44.701
Pops! Pops!

04:44.910 --> 04:47.079
- Hi, Pops.
- Kay was our only daughter.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.333
<i>I know a father's not supposed
to have favorites, but when it's Kay...</i>

04:51.750 --> 04:54.503
- You smell good.
- You like it?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.548
- What's that?
- An atomizer.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.425
Where'd you get it?
A present? Who from?

05:00.592 --> 05:02.886
Oh, somebody.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.271
What's happened to you?
You look different.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.648
- I do?
- Yeah.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.026
You look all lit up inside.

05:18.861 --> 05:23.490
Not wearing your usual deadpan look, that
How did I ever get into this family? look.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.367
Oh, Pops.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.412
You've been taking the vitamins
Dr. Gray sent you, huh?

05:28.579 --> 05:30.122
That's right.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.061
I guess I'll get me
some of those vitamins.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.023
I'll get it, Delilah!

05:57.566 --> 06:00.027
What's the matter with her?
Acts kind of queer.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.987
I don't know. Maybe she's in love.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.822
Who would she be in love with?

06:03.989 --> 06:08.410
- I haven't the wildest idea.
- You must have some idea to mention it.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.828
Well...

06:10.996 --> 06:11.955
Buckley.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.707
- Who?
- Buckley.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.001
- Buckley who?
- Oh, you know that boy.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.128
Buckley. I don't know his last name.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.089
- Never heard of him.
- He's been here again and again.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.885
- Well, that doesn't mean anything.
- All right, I'm wrong.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.096
Sorry. Forgive me.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.891
- Who was it, dear?
- Buckley.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.565
- He's coming for me in a few minutes.
- I'll get your coffee.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.654
- Where'd the boys go?
- Ben had some date...

06:43.820 --> 06:46.865
...Tommy went to play basketball.
Delilah, bring the coffee.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.326
- Yes, Mrs. Banks.
- Twenty wins.

06:49.493 --> 06:53.664
- You'd think those boys could stay home.
- Ben's not a boy, Pops. He's a man.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.334
- He's old enough to have a family.
- At 19?

06:57.793 --> 07:00.712
Buckley says that's not
too young for a man to marry.

07:00.921 --> 07:06.009
- I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.
- I know, but that was millions of years ago.

07:06.176 --> 07:10.055
Look at the men in Ben's college.
Loads of them are married with children.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.932
Gls.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.144
Buckley says everyone
should marry young.

07:19.022 --> 07:23.402
Did Buckley happen to mention who was
going to finance these child marriages?

07:23.569 --> 07:27.614
He says the family should support them.
He says it's economy in the long run.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.284
The men work better
and the babies are healthier.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.161
<i>From the way she talked
about Buckley, you'd think...</i>

07:33.328 --> 07:36.081
<i>... he was Moses, Einstein
and Gallup rolled into one.</i>

07:36.290 --> 07:38.375
<i>I tried to remember which one he was.</i>

07:38.542 --> 07:42.713
<i>There'd been so many boys who'd beat a
path to our door. Which one was Buckley?</i>

07:43.255 --> 07:45.716
<i>Was it the boy with the teeth?</i>

07:46.091 --> 07:48.886
<i>Or the guy with the porcupine hair?</i>

07:49.845 --> 07:54.099
<i>Or the English teacher,
that poop-a-doop that Ellie liked?</i>

07:54.850 --> 07:58.562
<i>I hoped he wasn't that muscle-bound
ham with the shoulders.</i>

07:59.271 --> 08:02.900
<i>And she'd never fall
for that bebop hound.</i>

08:03.609 --> 08:08.906
<i>And it couldn't be that genius who said he'd
fix my radio. She couldn't do that to me.</i>

08:10.240 --> 08:14.077
<i>Couldn't be the radical.
She hadn't been on a picket line in years.</i>

08:14.244 --> 08:17.164
<i>Surely my daughter wouldn't
fall for any of them.</i>

08:17.331 --> 08:18.832
<i>Or would she?</i>

08:19.625 --> 08:22.127
<i>She was still going on about him.</i>

08:22.294 --> 08:26.340
Buckley has it figured out. He says
there isn't going to be any depression.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.300
I won't be home for the weekend.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.929
Where are you going, dear?
I'm spending it with Buckley's family.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.849
Are you going to marry this character?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.520
I guess so.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.777
And just when are you planning
on getting married?

08:47.152 --> 08:50.072
Well, I really don't know yet, Mother.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.157
It all depends on Buckley's plans.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.620
It may be months, it may be a few
weeks, it may be anytime at all.

08:56.787 --> 08:57.955
We can't tell yet.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.751
But we won't be pinned down. Buckley's
very decided about that sort of thing.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.504
He just won't be pinned down.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.761
I hope that Buckley won't think I'm
too nosy if I ask a few simple questions.

09:13.637 --> 09:16.640
Okay, Pops. I suppose
we have to go through this.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.977
- Seems to me...
- Who is this Buckley anyway?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.104
- Listen, Pops...
- What's his last name?

09:22.271 --> 09:24.606
- I hope it's better than his first.
- Listen...

09:24.815 --> 09:26.316
Where the devil is he from?

09:26.483 --> 09:30.195
Who does he think will support him?
If he thinks I am, he's wrong!

09:30.404 --> 09:32.698
- I don't give a hoot...
- Stanley! Stanley...

09:32.823 --> 09:37.703
You don't have to shout. Nobody's deaf.
It's mortifying with right in there.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.371
Please.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.125
The idea.
Acting like an outraged father.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.668
Sorry.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.754
You broke it to me
so casually over the ice cream.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.299
You might've
at least waited until coffee.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.719
Oh, thanks, Delilah. I'll pour it.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.223
You don't give Kay a chance.

09:58.390 --> 10:02.811
Now listen, Pops. I'm 20 and
Buckley's 26, and we're grown people.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.814
As far as you supporting us,
I'll tell you right now...

10:05.939 --> 10:09.985
...he's the kind that wouldn't let
anyone support him. He'd rather die first.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.822
That's the kind of a person he is.
He's a wonderful person.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.366
He's the kind of a person
that's absolutely...

10:16.533 --> 10:18.785
I mean, absolutely independent.

10:19.620 --> 10:24.333
Buckley wouldn't come to you for help,
not even if we were starving in the gutter.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.339
And his name is Dunstan.

10:30.506 --> 10:35.260
That's what it is. Buckley Dunstan.
And he's a wonderful businessman.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.596
I mean, a really wonderful businessman.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.140
- And he has a wonderful job.
- Doing what?

10:40.307 --> 10:43.393
Oh, I don't know, Pops.
He makes something.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.687
Does it really matter what it is?

10:45.896 --> 10:51.109
He's the kind of a person that can do
anything, anything at all. He's... He's...

10:51.276 --> 10:54.655
...absolutely, terribly, wonderful.

10:56.949 --> 10:59.451
Stanley, you've hurt her.

11:00.285 --> 11:03.914
While she was talking,
all I could think of was a little girl...

11:04.122 --> 11:09.253
...in brown pigtails and dirty overalls, flying
at the boys when they pushed her too far.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.214
Seems like such
an incredibly short time ago.

11:12.381 --> 11:16.009
Go speak to her.
I'm afraid she's crying.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.397
Kay...

11:28.564 --> 11:32.067
And as for his parents,
I'll tell you this right now, Pops...

11:32.276 --> 11:35.362
...they're just as good as you and Moms.

11:35.571 --> 11:39.199
They're fine people,
and they live in Westbridge.

11:39.408 --> 11:43.495
I guess you'll agree that Westbridge
is as good a place as Fairview Manor.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.541
Oh, I don't see what that
has to do with it anyway.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.168
Okay, kitten.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.253
I love him already.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.673
What'd you say his last name was?

11:54.882 --> 11:57.092
Oh, Pops!

12:05.392 --> 12:08.020
Stanley! Come away from that window.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.023
I wanna get a peek at this superman.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.754
Oh, how nice. Come in.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.047
Stanley!

12:35.214 --> 12:38.091
- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.
- Kay'll be down in a minute.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.220
She went to get her things.
Won't you come and sit down?

12:41.345 --> 12:42.513
Well, I...

12:42.679 --> 12:44.473
Stanley?

12:45.057 --> 12:46.850
Stanley!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.687
Darling, you remember Mr...

12:50.854 --> 12:52.564
I can't call you Mr. anything.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.609
- You won't mind if I call you Buckley?
- Oh, please do.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.486
Good evening, sir.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.904
How are you?

12:59.071 --> 13:00.822
Fine.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.450
- And you?
- Fine.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.911
Kay's been telling us
some exciting news.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.871
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, no.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.748
We're delighted. Aren't we?

13:09.915 --> 13:13.252
It's wonderful, so exciting,
having a romance right under our...

13:13.418 --> 13:16.755
That is, well, you might say,
right in our midst.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.049
Isn't it, Stanley?

13:19.216 --> 13:20.300
Stanley?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.803
Oh, yes.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.390
I'm afraid it was a little sudden...

13:26.557 --> 13:28.058
...but I couldn't...

13:36.984 --> 13:39.278
- Hello there.
- Hello.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.239
- Was I too early?
- Oh, no.

13:44.950 --> 13:49.121
- Better put on your heavy coat.
- Oh, Pops, I'd die in that heavy coat.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.040
- I'd smother to death.
- Just the same, I'd wear it.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.501
Don't fuss.
I'll be perfectly all right.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.171
I think you'd better take it.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.966
- You do?
- Yes.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.926
Okay.

14:09.892 --> 14:13.020
<i>Right then I realized that my day was over.</i>

14:13.187 --> 14:16.690
<i>She'll always love us, of course,
but not in the old way.</i>

14:16.899 --> 14:22.738
<i>From here on, her love will be doled out like
a farmer's wife tossing scraps to a rooster.</i>

14:24.573 --> 14:25.949
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.660
Good night, Pops.
Don't wait up, we'll be late.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.913
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:38.212 --> 14:39.505
I don't like him.

14:39.671 --> 14:44.510
Oh, darling, I know he isn't good enough
for Kay, but then no one is or ever will be.

14:44.718 --> 14:48.639
- At least he's better than her other beaus.
- That's a great recommendation.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.642
- She's old enough to know her own mind.
- That child?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.561
You didn't mind that
I was 18 when I married you.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.356
- Well, that's...
- That's different.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.568
Oh, she'll make a beautiful bride.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.737
She has just the coloring and figure.

15:03.862 --> 15:07.199
I know the dress she should wear!
It was in last month's Vogue.

15:07.366 --> 15:10.536
<i>I couldn't believe it.
Ellie was as happy as a lark.</i>

15:10.661 --> 15:14.039
<i>She wasn't worrying about Buckley.
Her mind was on the wedding.</i>

15:14.206 --> 15:17.543
Some make you look ghastly,
but this was perfect. I'll find it.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.712
It had just a touch of eggshell pink.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.965
What's the matter, darling?
Can't you sleep?

16:05.174 --> 16:07.342
- No.
- You want some hot milk?

16:07.551 --> 16:10.387
- No.
- Well, then, good night.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.517
Boy, you're wonderful.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.895
Thank you, darling.

16:19.271 --> 16:24.568
If Kay was out at a dance, you wouldn't
close your eyes until you heard her come in.

16:24.735 --> 16:28.947
When it's a question of whether she'll
eat for the rest of her life, you sleep.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.658
Eat? You want something to eat?

16:31.783 --> 16:36.538
I am talking about Kay, Ellie. Kay.

16:37.247 --> 16:41.126
She sits there tonight and says,
I'm marrying Buckley. Isn't he cute?

16:41.293 --> 16:43.754
And we all dance and make faces.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.380
What do we know about him?

16:45.506 --> 16:47.758
If you're gonna sit up, put on your robe.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.969
We don't know a thing about him.
Not a darn thing!

16:51.136 --> 16:54.223
Don't know where he comes from,
or what he makes.

16:54.389 --> 16:57.059
We only know his name,
and you weren't sure about that.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.520
And yet he walks in
and we hand him Kay.

16:59.728 --> 17:04.107
You only have to look at him to know he's
nice and that he comes from a nice family.

17:04.273 --> 17:08.319
The way he calls you sir
and holds my chair for me...

17:08.487 --> 17:13.116
That reminds me. I must call his family
tomorrow and tell them how happy we are.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.579
Is that all you need, that he holds your
chair for you and he says sir to me?

17:17.788 --> 17:20.958
Is that all you want?
Well, it isn't all I want!

17:21.124 --> 17:25.378
I want to know if he'll make her happy. If he
can make a home for her and support her.

17:25.503 --> 17:29.466
You heard his ideas on marriage.
He thinks the family should support them.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.469
And you know which family
he means, don't you, honey?

17:32.636 --> 17:35.180
He means us. Sure, sure.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.558
He figures on moving in with us.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.562
Then when the food gets bad,
why, he'll dump the kids on us and skip.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.481
Probably done it before.
Probably got another wife.

17:44.648 --> 17:48.610
Read about it all the time.
Fellas have wives in three or four places.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.737
Maybe he's got a criminal record!

17:50.863 --> 17:53.782
Fella might be a counterfeiter
or confidence man or...

17:53.949 --> 17:55.492
Those are the ones.

17:55.659 --> 17:59.830
Those smooth-talking ones
that have the manners.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.832
Manners are their stock and trade.

18:02.040 --> 18:07.004
Yeah, those soft-spoken fellas who look
you right in the eye and would put a bullet...

18:07.171 --> 18:09.548
...in her neck and never turn a hair!

18:09.715 --> 18:13.552
You mark my words,
this is going to end in tragedy.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.394
But, Stanley, I...

18:22.603 --> 18:24.813
<i>Well, I got it off my chest.</i>

18:24.980 --> 18:29.443
<i>Funny, the minute you get someone else
worrying, you stop worrying yourself.</i>

18:50.714 --> 18:52.382
Come in!

18:57.262 --> 19:00.015
Well, you're an early bird.

19:03.185 --> 19:06.396
How you could sleep, I don't know.
I couldn't close my eyes.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.649
I was so upset about Kay.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.651
Kay? What's Kay done now?

19:10.817 --> 19:14.863
Oh, I kept thinking about what you said.
Suppose he is a good-for-nothing?

19:15.072 --> 19:17.741
Suppose he doesn't mean
to make a home for her?

19:17.908 --> 19:20.160
Now, stop worrying, Ellie.

19:20.369 --> 19:23.330
You've got to talk with him
before this goes any farther.

19:23.539 --> 19:27.459
You've got to come right out and ask him
about what he has and everything.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.420
Oh, darling, I can't do that.
I can't walk up and say:

19:30.587 --> 19:33.841
- How's your bank balance, kid?
- Why not? You're her father.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.634
I know, but even a father...

19:35.843 --> 19:37.803
Stanley...

19:37.970 --> 19:40.889
I believe you're afraid of him.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.642
Well, that's a fine remark, I must say.

19:43.809 --> 19:49.231
Stanley, Kay's up. Now, you tell her you
want to see this boy and right away.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.205
Finished?

20:10.794 --> 20:11.795
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.714
- How are you?
- Fine.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.549
Kay?

20:16.758 --> 20:18.719
About Buckley...

20:21.138 --> 20:22.514
What about him?

20:22.723 --> 20:26.476
Oh, I think he's great.
Fine chap. Nice, clean-cut chap.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.061
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.523
I thought, you know, we might
have a little talk, you know.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.525
About what he's earning,
you know...

20:33.692 --> 20:35.819
- You're kidding.
- That sort of thing. L...

20:35.986 --> 20:39.489
I didn't believe they really did that.
I thought it was just a gag.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.910
After all, when a man's
only daughter is getting married...

20:43.076 --> 20:46.955
If you want to go through that
old-fashioned rigamarole, it's okay with me.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.749
When do you want to see him?

20:48.916 --> 20:50.751
Well, what about tonight?

20:50.918 --> 20:52.294
We have a date at 9.

20:52.461 --> 20:56.215
Why don't you ask him to dinner?
We can talk before dinner. About 6:30?

20:56.340 --> 20:58.634
Okay. I'll deliver him.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.762
Kay, Kay! You know, don't...
Tell him we're gonna chat.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.555
Don't make it sound formidable.

21:03.764 --> 21:07.684
- I don't want to frighten the boy to death.
- Oh, don't worry about Buckley.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.229
He's big enough to take it.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.039
Hi.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.916
Hi.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.263
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.

21:44.429 --> 21:47.516
It's Delilah's night out,
and Kay and I are cooking dinner.

21:47.683 --> 21:50.644
- We might put you to work. I have an apron...
- Not now.

21:50.811 --> 21:53.856
- Let him get his talk with Pops over.
- Talk?

21:54.022 --> 21:58.277
- You're going to have a talk?
- Yes. A talk.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.613
- Where's Pop?
- He's in the living room, I think.

22:07.619 --> 22:10.205
- Here he is, Pops.
- Oh! Oh, hello. Hello.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.665
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

22:11.832 --> 22:15.002
- Make it snappy, dinner's in half an hour.
- Well, sit down.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.087
- Thanks.
- I'll take that.

22:17.254 --> 22:19.423
Oh, thanks, but I'll need the papers.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.049
Oh. Okay.

22:21.258 --> 22:24.469
- Kay said you wanted to talk...
- Would you like a drink first?

22:24.636 --> 22:26.680
- No, sir.
- A smoke, then?

22:26.889 --> 22:28.807
I have some, thanks. Will you?

22:28.974 --> 22:32.853
Oh, no. No, thanks. I'll smoke a pipe.
Wonderful thing, a pipe.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.980
- Do you smoke a pipe?
- No, sir.

22:35.105 --> 22:38.692
I like a pipe.
Especially after a hard day, you know.

22:38.901 --> 22:43.155
All the rush and the fuss.
It sort of changes your pace, rests you.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.115
Yes, sir.

22:46.617 --> 22:49.620
- Are you comfortable there?
- Yes, sir.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.830
I brought some papers I wanted you to...

22:51.997 --> 22:55.209
I suppose you think it's silly,
this financial talk...

22:55.417 --> 23:00.088
...but I wish my father-in-law had sat down
with me before Ellie and I got married.

23:00.297 --> 23:03.926
- I think it sort of clears the air.
- Well, you're right, sir.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.802
- You don't want a drink?
- Yes.

23:05.969 --> 23:09.973
- Oh, you would?
- I mean, yes, sir, I'm sure I won't.

23:12.309 --> 23:16.271
- Well, where were we?
- We were talking about your father-in-law.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.774
Oh, yes.

23:18.941 --> 23:20.526
Well, someday...

23:20.692 --> 23:24.863
I think that I probably understand,
you know, the problems of young couples...

23:25.030 --> 23:27.783
...what they're up against, of course.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.160
The parents are up against it too.

23:30.327 --> 23:34.289
You know, what with high prices
and high taxes and everything, and...

23:34.790 --> 23:39.419
The long and short of it is, you're entitled
to know what you can expect from me...

23:39.586 --> 23:44.299
...as I'm entitled to know what I can expect
from you. Get to know about each other.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.301
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.345
So my proposal is this:

23:48.554 --> 23:51.181
I thought I'd tell you
a little about my setup...

23:51.348 --> 23:54.226
...and then we could go
into your financial picture.

23:54.393 --> 23:55.394
Yes, sir.

23:55.602 --> 23:59.398
In the first place, Buckley, you look
at this house and everything...

23:59.565 --> 24:01.900
...and you probably think, He's well-off.

24:02.025 --> 24:05.821
But let me tell you, my boy,
that doesn't mean a thing.

24:06.029 --> 24:09.491
The day I married Ellie,
my position with the law firm of...

24:09.658 --> 24:12.619
...Bartham, Henderson and Peck
was as nebulous...

24:12.828 --> 24:18.417
<i>In half an hour, I told him more about my
affairs than I had told Ellie in a lifetime.</i>

24:18.542 --> 24:23.297
You take all of those things, the insurance,
the mortgages, the kids' schooling...

24:23.422 --> 24:27.593
...and straightening Tommy's teeth.
They all sound tough, but I think...

24:27.801 --> 24:31.597
...it was good to assume responsibility.
Gives you something to work for.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.599
Yes, sir.

24:34.808 --> 24:38.562
Now, if you'd like to look at some
of these papers that I brought...

24:38.729 --> 24:40.689
Come on, you two.
Soup's on the table.

24:40.898 --> 24:44.276
We'll go into that another time.
We mustn't keep Kay waiting.

24:44.443 --> 24:47.446
- Did you have a nice talk?
- Wonderful! I feel better.

24:47.613 --> 24:48.739
- Don't we, son?
- Yes.

24:48.906 --> 24:52.451
Run along, son. Don't keep Kay waiting.
Say, he's a smart boy.

24:52.618 --> 24:55.120
- Got a fine business sense.
- I should say he has.

24:55.329 --> 24:59.124
Kay told me he'd saved $5000 and
is the head of his company at his age!

24:59.291 --> 25:01.460
You see how silly we were to worry?

25:01.585 --> 25:03.462
Come on.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.884
This is the street.

25:09.259 --> 25:13.722
Too bad Kay couldn't have picked
her in-laws from somebody we knew.

25:13.889 --> 25:16.433
362, 364...

25:16.642 --> 25:20.229
- Bet they won't even have a drink.
- What makes you think they won't?

25:20.395 --> 25:22.940
- Just that kind of people.
- What if they don't?

25:23.106 --> 25:25.067
You're not an alcoholic, are you?

25:25.234 --> 25:28.612
Why get yourself in such
a lather about meeting the Dunstans?

25:28.779 --> 25:30.822
I'm not in a lather. Who's in a lather?

25:30.989 --> 25:33.242
Ought to be around here someplace.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.577
Bet it's a shack.

25:37.913 --> 25:40.582
Here it is, 394.

25:47.089 --> 25:49.466
There's your shack.

25:51.218 --> 25:55.097
I have a feeling they're behind
those curtains watching us.

26:01.770 --> 26:05.148
- Good afternoon.
- Good...

26:08.318 --> 26:10.571
May I have your coat?

26:11.697 --> 26:13.448
Thank you.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.043
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.129
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

26:27.296 --> 26:30.799
Well, look at this! There's a wedding.
Sure as guns, there it is.

26:30.966 --> 26:33.468
I can't tell you how crazy
we are about your Kay.

26:33.677 --> 26:36.638
Well, we feel just
the same way about Buckley.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.307
Yes, he's a wonderful boy.

26:38.515 --> 26:42.769
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
He's a lucky boy to get a girl like Kay.

26:42.936 --> 26:46.565
- Would you like to wash your hands?
- No, I washed them before I came.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.567
- Shall we go in?
- Yes, will you?

26:48.734 --> 26:54.698
<i>We did more bare-faced lying in those few
minutes than we had done in our entire lives.</i>

26:54.823 --> 26:59.077
I sent Kay and Buckley out to dinner.
I thought we could get better acquainted...

26:59.286 --> 27:02.498
...if there were just the four of us.
- It's cozier this way.

27:02.623 --> 27:05.918
I don't know how you feel, but
would you like a snifter before dinner?

27:06.084 --> 27:09.671
- I beg your pardon?
- I have Madeira. Put it down 25 years ago.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.965
Been saving it for a special occasion.

27:12.174 --> 27:14.968
And I don't know of a more
special occasion than this.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.929
- No, indeed.
- Here we are.

27:17.095 --> 27:19.806
- Thank you.
- Let's drink to the bride and groom.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.808
Hear, hear.

27:24.645 --> 27:28.190
Not too sweet, yet not too dry.

27:30.484 --> 27:35.531
I've been trying to decide whether Buckley
looks like you, Mrs. Dunstan, or Mr. Dunstan.

27:35.739 --> 27:40.619
Oh, do please call us Doris and Herbert,
not Mr. And Mrs. Dunstan.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.913
Stanley and Ellie.

27:44.706 --> 27:49.044
- Play golf, Herbert?
- Well, I play at it, Stanley.

27:49.211 --> 27:50.420
Well...

27:50.587 --> 27:53.882
- I love your house, Doris.
- Oh, thank you, Ellie.

27:54.049 --> 27:58.262
I'm crazy to see yours.
Buckley's always talking about it.

27:58.470 --> 28:01.849
- A little more, Stan?
- Well, just to help you out, Herb.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.225
There we are.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.936
Now that we're friends,
I'll tell you something.

28:06.103 --> 28:08.355
- I was scared about this meeting.
- Herbert...

28:08.522 --> 28:11.441
Big argument. Should we
or should we not offer a drink?

28:11.608 --> 28:14.611
I was for it, to break the ice,
but Doris was against it.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.239
Afraid you wouldn't approve.
Stickly situation.

28:17.406 --> 28:20.826
And we didn't want to start
off on the wrong foot.

28:20.993 --> 28:23.996
Well, now I'll tell you
something funny.

28:24.163 --> 28:26.832
Ellie here must have changed
clothes three times.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.792
- Stanley!
- You did, didn't you?

28:28.959 --> 28:31.211
I wasn't so scared
I had to stop for a martini.

28:32.296 --> 28:33.797
Martini? Is that your drink?

28:33.964 --> 28:39.595
Well, then why are we
wasting time with this? Come on!

28:47.394 --> 28:49.354
Now, then.

28:49.980 --> 28:52.357
Well, well, well.
Look at that.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.234
Look at that, Ellie.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.945
Well, well, what do you know?

28:58.238 --> 29:00.699
- Can I help you, Herb?
- Well, thanks, Stan.

29:00.824 --> 29:04.244
You know, the minute I laid eyes
on your boy, I liked him.

29:04.453 --> 29:08.332
And now that I've met his mother
and father, I like him even more.

29:08.499 --> 29:14.046
I'm sure that the Dunstan-Banks family
are gonna be as one from now on.

29:16.673 --> 29:19.510
And now I want to hear
all about our new daughter.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.929
- There's nothing to tell, really.
- Nonsense.

29:22.137 --> 29:25.557
Would you like to hear about the time
Kay was a baby and Ellie left her...

29:25.724 --> 29:29.478
...in front of the store in her carriage,
went home and forgot about her?

29:29.645 --> 29:31.980
- It's the truth.
- There's a drop left. Want it?

29:32.105 --> 29:34.399
Kay was about 9 months old.
Oh, and she...

29:34.566 --> 29:39.488
I know every father thinks his daughter
is wonderful, but Kay was really something.

29:39.696 --> 29:42.324
She was 5 when I gave her
her first swimming lesson.

29:42.491 --> 29:45.327
She was absolutely wonderful.
Not frightened a bit.

29:45.536 --> 29:48.705
You know how Ellie is about the water,
but Kay takes after me.

29:48.914 --> 29:52.709
A daughter takes after the father,
and the father takes after the...

29:52.876 --> 29:55.128
Well, vice versa, isn't that so, Edith?

29:55.337 --> 29:56.922
- Doris.
- Huh?

29:57.089 --> 29:58.131
Doris, dear.

29:58.298 --> 29:59.424
Doris, sweetie. Yes.

29:59.591 --> 30:01.468
Oh, Doris.

30:02.594 --> 30:05.389
Oh, I'm so...
Edith. Where did I...?

30:05.556 --> 30:10.310
Well, anyway, she just took
like a duck to water. Just like a...

30:10.477 --> 30:15.816
When she was 6, I took her out to the raft
with the other kids and threw her in.

30:16.358 --> 30:21.780
Yeah, she'd just plop in.
Diving, she called it.

30:23.490 --> 30:27.244
She was only 15 when
the boys started crowding in.

30:27.411 --> 30:30.539
They were all over.
I'd come home and find a stranger...

30:30.664 --> 30:37.087
...sleeping on the sofa in the living room and
one on the hammock in the porch and one...

30:37.254 --> 30:40.799
And then all of a sudden,
she seemed to lose interest in them...

30:41.008 --> 30:44.219
And then she met Buckley.
You must tell us all about Buckley.

30:44.386 --> 30:46.680
Yeah, tell us all about Balkey.

30:48.223 --> 30:54.146
Well, Buckley was always a good boy.
A thoughtful, sweet boy.

30:54.313 --> 30:58.942
Even when he was only 5,
I remember him saying, Mummy.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.570
That's what he used to call me.
Mummy.

31:01.778 --> 31:06.325
He said, Mummy, you won't
ever die, will you, Mummy?

31:06.533 --> 31:07.659
How sweet.

31:07.826 --> 31:10.329
Oh, he was a good boy,
but he wasn't any angel.

31:10.496 --> 31:13.957
He could hold his own with any
of the kids, and he loved sports.

31:14.124 --> 31:16.210
Oh, how that boy loved sports.

31:16.460 --> 31:21.173
<i>It is the duty of the bride's family to give
a party to announce the engagement.</i>

31:21.340 --> 31:24.468
<i>Apparently, this is done
only after everyone knows it.</i>

31:24.676 --> 31:26.803
- Ready?
- Well, it's only 5:00.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.056
You got everything?
I asked the neighbors...

31:29.181 --> 31:32.100
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

31:32.309 --> 31:33.894
Look, I made a lot of martinis.

31:34.061 --> 31:37.731
That's all anybody ever drinks
at these things. You know, martinis?

31:37.898 --> 31:41.693
Now, Ellie, after I bring in the drinks
and everybody's got a drink...

31:41.860 --> 31:45.155
...you know, and something to eat,
then I'm gonna ring the bell.

31:45.322 --> 31:47.783
Ringing the bell,
and you call for silence, see?

31:47.991 --> 31:49.660
- Then I'll make the speech.
- Yes.

31:49.827 --> 31:53.121
Now, now, what do you think of this?
I thought I'd start out:

31:53.288 --> 31:57.876
- Friends, when I was a young lawyer...
- Darling. They're coming. Excuse me, dear.

31:58.085 --> 32:00.504
Oh, they're coming?
They're coming.

32:08.053 --> 32:11.682
I made a speech, and the man got 10 years.

32:14.101 --> 32:16.353
Well, I seem to have
found the right place.

32:16.562 --> 32:18.021
- Hello, Dixon.
- How are you?

32:18.188 --> 32:21.525
- A couple of old Fashioneds to start.
- How about a martini? L...

32:21.692 --> 32:25.154
No, thanks. It's kind of you,
but old Fashioneds would be fine.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.530
- Old Fashioneds?
- Yes.

32:26.697 --> 32:29.950
- I just fixed these up to take out there.
- Oh, well. I...

32:30.117 --> 32:31.660
Well, well...

32:31.785 --> 32:34.079
- May I have a Tom Collins?
- Bourbon and soda.

32:34.246 --> 32:37.749
Tom Collins. Wouldn't you like a martini?
Martinis are awful nice.

32:37.916 --> 32:42.212
I hope you have better luck than I did.
I spent 5000 on my daughter's wedding.

32:42.379 --> 32:45.340
Six months later,
she was on her way to Reno.

32:45.549 --> 32:48.302
- Thanks.
- Two old Fashioneds.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.012
Dixon, old boy, how you been?

32:50.220 --> 32:52.347
Hiya, Stanley.
I see they got you working.

32:52.514 --> 32:55.601
- Two bourbons and plain water.
- How about a nice martini?

32:55.809 --> 32:57.769
Stanley, Doris and Herbert are here.

32:57.936 --> 32:59.521
Doris and Herbert who?

32:59.688 --> 33:02.191
Oh, hello, hello.

33:03.192 --> 33:05.694
- How are you?
- I've got your drinks all ready.

33:05.861 --> 33:08.322
If you don't mind,
it's early for a martini.

33:08.489 --> 33:09.656
We'll have Scotch.

33:09.781 --> 33:12.034
- I don't think I've got Scotch.
- No Scotch?

33:12.201 --> 33:13.869
- Would bourbon do?
- Well, yes.

33:14.036 --> 33:18.832
- Have Delilah bring them when they're ready.
- Too early for a martini?

33:19.500 --> 33:21.084
Hi there, Stan.

33:21.251 --> 33:24.588
Hello, hello. Hi, hi. Have a martini.

33:24.796 --> 33:26.548
The girls want old Fashioneds.

33:26.715 --> 33:30.093
What do they think I'm doing in here,
filling prescriptions?

33:30.260 --> 33:32.221
Where are the drinks for the Dunstans?

33:32.429 --> 33:35.891
There you are, Delilah.
Now, four old Fashioneds.

33:47.319 --> 33:49.279
When you gonna make your speech?

33:49.446 --> 33:51.865
Soon as I can get in there,
I'm gonna make it.

33:52.032 --> 33:56.203
Well, enjoy your minute
in the limelight. It'll be your last.

33:56.411 --> 33:58.914
From now on, the gals take over.

33:59.081 --> 34:02.960
You think they can't add two and two,
but when it comes to weddings...

34:03.126 --> 34:04.837
...they're giants of industry.

34:05.045 --> 34:08.005
And they put it on like a big
theatrical production too.

34:08.215 --> 34:09.925
The bigger the better.

34:10.092 --> 34:14.012
From now on, your only function
is to pay the bills.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.681
No, no. This is gonna be
a very simple wedding.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.560
Well, I'm warning you,
keep it in the family.

34:19.768 --> 34:22.353
Weddings are either confined
to the bosom of the family...

34:22.563 --> 34:24.438
...or held in Madison Square Garden.

34:24.606 --> 34:27.150
- You got my drinks ready yet?
- Yes, right here.

34:27.359 --> 34:28.944
- Thank you.
- Here.

34:29.402 --> 34:30.946
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

34:31.155 --> 34:33.739
- Isn't it a nice party?
- I haven't been out there.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.909
Now, what do you want?
A couple of dozen frozen daiquiris?

34:37.077 --> 34:39.663
A couple martinis,
if it's not too much trouble.

34:39.871 --> 34:42.040
Did you say martinis?

34:42.416 --> 34:45.502
Here, here. Have a couple,
and pass the rest around, boy.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.670
Thank you, sir.

34:46.879 --> 34:49.047
Say, could I have a couple of Cokes?

34:49.214 --> 34:51.216
- A couple of what?
- Cokes.

34:52.176 --> 34:53.969
A couple of Cokes.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.681
A couple of Cokes.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.940
Here, sir. Let me.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.870
Thank you, sir.

35:41.975 --> 35:45.062
Five mint juleps, if you please.

35:45.479 --> 35:47.856
Could I help?
Lt'll speed things up.

35:47.981 --> 35:50.651
No, no. No.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.403
No, I like doing this.
It's my hobby.

35:53.570 --> 35:56.156
You were right about that...
Tom Collins, please.

35:56.323 --> 35:58.492
I'll have four rum and Cokes.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.577
Another bourbon and soda.

36:01.411 --> 36:04.540
- Good night, Ellie.
- Wonderful party. Wonderful.

36:06.959 --> 36:10.420
Well, you're a big help, I must say.
Where have you been?

36:10.587 --> 36:12.965
Where do you think I've been,
shooting pool?

36:13.131 --> 36:15.884
Why must you always leave everything
on my shoulders?

36:16.051 --> 36:18.345
- Is everybody gone?
- Of course. It's almost 8:00.

36:18.512 --> 36:21.014
- But I haven't made my speech.
- It's too late.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.642
Now, now, Ellie.
You can't do that to Stan.

36:23.809 --> 36:27.437
You can't deny him the right
to announce his daughter's engagement.

36:27.604 --> 36:30.274
You don't realize what a delicate
condition he's in.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.401
He's about to become a grandfather.

36:32.568 --> 36:35.821
Come on, Stan.
Let's hear your speech.

36:36.446 --> 36:40.492
As I look at all the old faces
I used to shake hands with...

36:40.659 --> 36:42.452
Wait for the laugh.

36:44.496 --> 36:47.958
Come on, let's get
one of those martinis.

36:49.710 --> 36:51.962
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

36:53.255 --> 36:56.675
<i>We finally got around
to discussing the wedding.</i>

36:59.803 --> 37:03.473
Well, then, we're all agreed.
It's going to be a small wedding.

37:04.725 --> 37:07.978
- Ellie? A small wedding, huh?
- Yes, of course.

37:08.145 --> 37:10.647
That's what we all want.
A small wedding.

37:10.814 --> 37:13.901
A small wedding
and a small reception.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.778
That's what I want too.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.908
- Come on. We've got...
- You're not leaving now?

37:21.074 --> 37:25.204
I've got a million things to talk to you
about. I never can get you two alone.

37:25.370 --> 37:29.291
We've got to make plans, set the date,
make arrangements about the church...

37:29.500 --> 37:30.834
The church? The what?

37:31.001 --> 37:34.046
- You're not planning on a church wedding?
- Why, of course.

37:34.213 --> 37:37.132
But you were married in
your front parlor in a blue suit.

37:37.341 --> 37:38.550
- That's just it.
- What?

37:38.717 --> 37:41.220
Whose wedding are you talking about,
yours or Kay's?

37:41.345 --> 37:43.388
Haven't you got
some schoolwork to do?

37:43.555 --> 37:46.016
Can't be June,
I've got my final. Why not May?

37:46.141 --> 37:48.977
- May's too early.
- July's out. I'm going to camp.

37:49.144 --> 37:52.397
This isn't a kids' party.
It's my wedding and my friends.

37:52.606 --> 37:54.399
Ellie, what did you mean by...?

37:54.608 --> 37:58.237
No one has to raise a finger.
When the time comes, I'll do everything.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.531
- I can imagine that!
- I'm not going.

38:00.697 --> 38:03.075
Listen, I don't care
if you come or not!

38:03.242 --> 38:06.078
If you insist upon a church wedding,
count me out.

38:06.286 --> 38:09.081
- I wash my hands of the whole affair.
- Stanley!

38:11.792 --> 38:14.127
Run along.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

38:14.336 --> 38:16.296
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

38:26.765 --> 38:28.225
Stanley...

38:28.475 --> 38:30.769
I don't know what's the matter
with you.

38:30.936 --> 38:33.939
We're having a simple talk,
and you fly off the handle.

38:34.064 --> 38:36.441
You heard Buckley.
You heard Kay, didn't you?

38:36.608 --> 38:38.485
You said it would be
a small wedding.

38:38.694 --> 38:41.488
I know, darling, and it's going
to be a small wedding.

38:41.655 --> 38:45.450
With the things you're talking about?
Bridesmaids and churches...

38:45.617 --> 38:48.245
...automobiles and flowers
and heaven knows what!

38:48.412 --> 38:50.789
All our friends have given
weddings like that.

38:50.956 --> 38:54.376
If they want to bankrupt themselves,
that's their business, not mine.

38:54.501 --> 38:57.212
But we've always lived
very simply, within our means.

38:57.421 --> 38:59.715
What are we gonna do,
put on a big show?

38:59.882 --> 39:02.885
A big, flashy show
that we can't afford.

39:10.767 --> 39:15.022
There's only one time in a girl's life
that she can be married in a bridal dress.

39:15.189 --> 39:18.942
Just once, and I don't want Kay
to miss it the way I did.

39:19.109 --> 39:21.195
Miss it? Miss it?

39:21.361 --> 39:24.531
Don't you think I wanted a wedding
with all the trimmings?

39:24.698 --> 39:25.991
Why didn't you have it?

39:26.158 --> 39:29.745
Because you didn't want it,
so I pretended I didn't either.

39:30.329 --> 39:33.248
And you've been brooding about it
all this time?

39:33.457 --> 39:36.585
No, of course not,
but I have thought about it.

39:37.628 --> 39:41.340
Buy yourself a wedding dress
and I'll marry you all over again.

39:41.465 --> 39:44.134
No, I'll be satisfied
to see Kay in one.

39:44.259 --> 39:49.515
Stanley, I don't know how to explain,
but a wedding, a church wedding...

39:49.723 --> 39:51.892
...well, it's what every girl dreams of.

39:52.100 --> 39:55.812
A bridal dress,
orange blossoms, the music...

39:55.979 --> 39:59.024
...it's something lovely for her
to remember all her life.

39:59.191 --> 40:02.069
And something for us
to remember too.

40:04.196 --> 40:06.281
<i>From then on, I was a dead duck.</i>

40:06.448 --> 40:09.660
- You should've seen it.
- I did! I saw it from the back.

40:09.827 --> 40:11.578
- The look on the poor...
- Hi, Pop!

40:11.703 --> 40:14.790
I'm sorry we're late getting home,
but we had a busy day.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.417
Just wait until you see these.
Delilah?

40:17.543 --> 40:21.505
- Did a dress come for me today?
- There are six or seven packages upstairs.

40:21.672 --> 40:25.551
- Pops, wait until you see this one.
- These slippers were such a bargain.

40:25.717 --> 40:28.595
Yes. If you could let
the clothes go for a minute...

40:28.762 --> 40:30.222
Have you got the list yet?

40:30.389 --> 40:33.141
I have to give it to Miss Bellamy
in the office...

40:33.308 --> 40:35.811
...to get the order in for invitations
and announcements.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.855
- Aren't these pretty?
- The list?

40:37.980 --> 40:40.649
I have it right here in my bag.
Where's the bag?

40:40.858 --> 40:44.069
The bag? The bag is here.
Here's the bag.

40:45.237 --> 40:48.657
Isn't that lovely? That's what
the bridesmaids are going to wear.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.284
Aren't you afraid of the cops?

40:50.450 --> 40:53.287
It should give the idea of spring,
of wood nymphs in glades.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.455
Like the girl on the White Rock bottle.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.291
Here's the thing.

40:59.543 --> 41:01.920
- Kay? Kay!
- Two...

41:02.087 --> 41:04.923
- Hi! Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

41:05.090 --> 41:09.219
- Kay, what did you get today?
- Come up. See my new evening dress.

41:09.970 --> 41:12.806
Two spectator sport suits,
one spectator sport...

41:12.973 --> 41:16.560
This is no list. This is something
to do about clothes.

41:16.727 --> 41:20.814
Country suit, plaza suit, shoes to match,
town suits, brown suits, shoes...

41:20.939 --> 41:24.776
...afternoon dresses, shoes, bags to match,
evening dresses, shoes, bags...

41:24.902 --> 41:28.322
...jewelry to match, hostess dress,
negligees, evening wrap, hats...

41:28.530 --> 41:30.866
...snuggeries, a plain coat,
a dozen slips...

41:31.033 --> 41:33.785
- What is this?
- Wrong list. It's her trousseau.

41:33.952 --> 41:36.288
- Is she gonna get all that?
- Of course.

41:36.455 --> 41:39.583
- Her closets are bulging.
- She can't wear those old things.

41:39.750 --> 41:43.295
Darling, do you know what trousseau
means? It's from the French.

41:43.420 --> 41:47.799
It means a little bundle that the bride
carries under her arm to her new home.

41:48.008 --> 41:50.219
How sweet.
I've got good news for you.

41:50.385 --> 41:54.097
- The church is free.
- Well, I'm glad something's free.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.683
I mean, it's available
on the 10 of June.

41:56.892 --> 42:00.604
- You mean we pay for the church?
- There were some telephone messages.

42:00.771 --> 42:03.357
A man called about flowers
for the church and reception.

42:03.524 --> 42:06.443
Mrs. Givens left her dressmaker's name.
The candid cameraman...

42:06.610 --> 42:09.321
- The candid cameraman?
- Thanks. I'll look later.

42:09.530 --> 42:11.740
The candid cameraman?

42:11.949 --> 42:13.033
Ben!

42:14.618 --> 42:15.619
How do I look?

42:15.786 --> 42:19.373
If you take your hands out of your pocket,
I could tell better. Come.

42:19.832 --> 42:21.583
Turn around.

42:21.792 --> 42:25.420
It fits perfectly.
I've got to get yours out of the attic.

42:25.587 --> 42:26.588
Like it, Pop?

42:26.755 --> 42:28.715
Are you getting a trousseau too?

42:28.882 --> 42:32.094
Didn't we tell you?
Buckley asked Ben to be his best man.

42:32.261 --> 42:36.932
He did, huh? $ 150! Why didn't
he pick on one of his own friends?

42:37.140 --> 42:40.936
I thought it was swell of him.
Why, I hardly know the guy.

42:41.144 --> 42:44.773
It's only two syllables, you know,
from bank to bankruptcy.

42:46.567 --> 42:48.026
Hello?

42:48.193 --> 42:51.155
A what? An orchestra?
You've got the wrong number.

42:51.321 --> 42:52.906
Wait, Stanley.

42:53.073 --> 42:55.701
Are you the orchestra
Mrs. Parkman recommended?

42:55.868 --> 42:57.411
How many of you are there?

42:57.619 --> 42:59.204
That sounds very nice.

42:59.371 --> 43:00.414
The 10 of June.

43:00.581 --> 43:02.583
I'll be hearing from you, then. Bye.

43:02.791 --> 43:05.169
Stanley, from now on,
don't answer the phone.

43:05.335 --> 43:08.338
- Orchestra? Are you out of your head?
- For the reception.

43:08.463 --> 43:10.924
We have to have music,
and it only costs $85.

43:11.091 --> 43:13.844
Only $85? Only $85.

43:14.011 --> 43:16.138
What will people say
when I'm in the gutter...

43:16.305 --> 43:19.683
...because I tried to put on a wedding
like a Roman emperor?

43:21.185 --> 43:25.689
<i>While my secretary went over the list
of wedding guests, I went over the bills.</i>

43:32.446 --> 43:36.825
Before I order the invitations, you ought to
know how many people Mrs. Banks is asking.

43:36.992 --> 43:38.160
A hundred?

43:38.327 --> 43:40.204
Five hundred and seventy-two.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.831
Five hundred and seventy-two?
There must be some mistake.

43:43.040 --> 43:46.084
Mrs. Banks doesn't mean
to ask them all to the reception.

43:46.251 --> 43:49.671
Only 280 of them. The rest
just get asked to the church.

43:49.838 --> 43:52.382
Only 280 come to the house, huh?

43:52.549 --> 43:55.636
The house won't hold 280 people.

43:55.802 --> 44:00.390
I was talking to our accountant.
He's married off four daughters.

44:00.599 --> 44:04.978
He breaks his wedding guests down
into units: Reception units and church units.

44:05.103 --> 44:08.607
Each reception unit includes
the cost of champagne...

44:08.774 --> 44:11.193
...caterers, tips, flowers,
extra insurance...

44:11.360 --> 44:13.654
- Insurance?
- Breakage and fire.

44:13.821 --> 44:15.823
Cigarette burns and that sort of thing.

44:16.031 --> 44:21.787
Broken down that way, he said the cost
of each reception unit comes to $3.75.

44:22.037 --> 44:23.580
A couple?

44:23.747 --> 44:25.290
A head.

44:26.834 --> 44:30.128
$3.75 a head?

44:32.047 --> 44:34.007
Thank you, Miss Bellamy.

44:34.508 --> 44:37.219
And good night.

44:39.471 --> 44:42.015
$3.75 a head.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.393
There are gonna be 150 people...

44:44.560 --> 44:47.688
...invited to this house to the
reception, and not one more.

44:47.896 --> 44:51.233
I don't care how many you invite
to the church. Pack them in.

44:51.400 --> 44:56.071
But the 151 st person who comes into this
house is gonna be thrown out on his neck.

44:56.238 --> 44:59.032
They're not my friends.
I wanted a small wedding.

44:59.199 --> 45:02.911
There are people you just can't ask
to the church. They'd be insulted.

45:03.078 --> 45:06.915
No longer a question of insulting people.
This is a question of survival.

45:07.082 --> 45:11.420
Put an X next to the names of people we
have to absolutely invite to the reception.

45:11.628 --> 45:13.839
We throw the rest out.
Let's get to work.

45:14.006 --> 45:17.676
I can't be any help. I've already
cut my list absolutely to the bone.

45:17.885 --> 45:20.762
Here's someone. The Sandways.
We never see them anyway.

45:20.929 --> 45:24.057
As for the woman with the dyed hair,
I don't care to ever see her.

45:24.183 --> 45:28.061
Harry Sandway happens to be one
of the best friends I have in the world.

45:28.228 --> 45:30.814
Besides being one
of my very best clients.

45:30.939 --> 45:32.441
Pops, a client.

45:32.608 --> 45:37.988
Harry Sandway would go to the ends
of the earth for me, and I for Harry.

45:40.991 --> 45:46.079
What about cutting down a little bit
on this garden club of yours?

45:46.246 --> 45:47.956
We could get along without them.

45:48.123 --> 45:50.417
We have to ask them.
They're running me for president.

45:50.542 --> 45:53.879
I thought a wedding was supposed
to be a joyous occasion.

45:54.087 --> 45:57.508
This is a business convention.

45:58.842 --> 46:01.845
- What's the matter with her?
- She's nervous.

46:02.012 --> 46:04.473
All women are nervous.

46:18.445 --> 46:20.239
Yes, come in.

46:23.867 --> 46:26.036
I'm sorry about the way I acted.

46:26.245 --> 46:28.413
That's all right.
I guess it was my fault.

46:28.580 --> 46:31.875
We're all a little unstrung
by this wedding business.

46:32.042 --> 46:33.961
All this fuss and worry.

46:34.169 --> 46:37.464
I never wanted anything like this.
I wanted a small wedding.

46:37.631 --> 46:40.676
That's what we all wanted,
but it kind of got out of hand.

46:40.843 --> 46:44.096
All this money. I feel horribly.

46:45.097 --> 46:48.016
- You know, kitten, I had an idea.
- What is it?

46:48.141 --> 46:51.728
I don't know if it's any good or not,
but I thought that...

46:51.895 --> 46:57.025
Well, I was wondering if I gave you
and Buckley about $ 1500...

46:57.192 --> 46:59.153
...how would you like to elope?

47:00.654 --> 47:01.655
Elope?

47:01.780 --> 47:04.408
Tomorrow or the next day,
you run off somewhere...

47:04.575 --> 47:06.326
But, Pops, eloping?

47:06.493 --> 47:08.954
Sneaking off and getting married?

47:09.163 --> 47:12.875
Well, I'd feel sort of, well,
as if something were wrong.

47:13.041 --> 47:15.335
As if you didn't want me
to marry Buckley.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.588
Kitten, I don't think it would...

47:17.796 --> 47:22.217
But to get married by the justice of peace
in some dirty little office...

47:22.342 --> 47:24.553
...with you and Moms not there?

47:25.304 --> 47:27.389
I don't know, Pops, but...

47:27.556 --> 47:30.267
I wouldn't feel as if
I were really getting married.

47:30.475 --> 47:33.896
- Well, it's just an idea.
- Stanley!

47:34.021 --> 47:36.190
Forget about it.
I'm coming, Ellie!

47:36.356 --> 47:38.650
- Lf you're worried about the money...
- No!

47:38.817 --> 47:41.862
Just forget all about it.
Let's forget I ever mentioned it.

47:42.029 --> 47:44.740
You've got to help me
cut this thing down.

47:44.907 --> 47:47.659
If we ask Bob and Betty,
we have to ask the Dicksons.

47:47.826 --> 47:51.830
- Then we have to have the Warners...
- Mother, let's call the whole thing off.

47:51.997 --> 47:54.333
- Let's not have the wedding.
- What?

47:54.500 --> 47:56.502
- Buckley and I could elope.
- Elope?

47:56.668 --> 48:00.464
I told you that I didn't want you
to talk about that eloping nonsense.

48:00.672 --> 48:02.382
Now stop it. Stop it.

48:02.549 --> 48:04.718
She's afraid I'm spending
too much money.

48:04.885 --> 48:08.055
Kay, you wouldn't elope.
It would break my heart.

48:08.180 --> 48:10.474
- Of course she wouldn't.
- But, Pops, you...

48:10.641 --> 48:15.896
I've heard all about this I care to hear.
Now stop it, stop it. Really, it's so...

48:16.021 --> 48:19.316
Look, we're not gonna
cut these down at all.

48:19.483 --> 48:21.568
- Invite all of them.
- Can we afford it?

48:21.777 --> 48:24.571
Of course we can afford it.
What is money for...

48:24.738 --> 48:28.492
...if it isn't to give my daughter
the finest wedding that's ever been...?

48:28.659 --> 48:31.411
What are you trying to do?
Get me in trouble?

48:34.623 --> 48:38.085
<i>Ellie had dug up one of those
little caterers.</i>

48:38.293 --> 48:42.464
<i>He was willing to take the whole
reception over and take us over too.</i>

48:42.631 --> 48:45.259
Yes, that's been
a very successful cake.

48:45.384 --> 48:47.594
We made that
for Brenda Santanya.

48:47.761 --> 48:51.390
The daughter of the Princess Rashisi
by her second husband.

48:51.557 --> 48:52.891
Yes, the princess.

48:53.058 --> 48:54.977
- Delightful person, isn't she?
- Yes.

48:55.102 --> 48:58.605
And this is another we made
for the Stoughton-Shutbright nuptials.

48:58.814 --> 49:00.649
- Do you like that, Mrs.?
- Banks.

49:00.858 --> 49:03.193
I'd better get your name
and the date first.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.070
Will you step over here, please?

49:05.237 --> 49:07.030
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie.

49:10.242 --> 49:12.286
Just for the cake.

49:13.328 --> 49:15.330
Will you sit here, please?

49:18.500 --> 49:21.712
- Now, then...
- Mr. And Mrs. Stanley Banks...

49:22.171 --> 49:25.090
...24 Maple Drive,
Fairview Manor.

49:25.257 --> 49:27.176
And the wedding is June 10th.

49:27.342 --> 49:29.553
June 10th. Very good.

49:29.720 --> 49:33.599
- Now, about the reception...
- We're not having a very large one.

49:33.807 --> 49:36.643
Small and selective.
I understand perfectly.

49:36.810 --> 49:39.605
And we don't want a cake.

49:39.897 --> 49:42.191
- What? You don't want a cake?
- No.

49:42.357 --> 49:43.734
- Why?
- Cakes are cheap.

49:43.901 --> 49:45.819
Everybody has one.
We don't want one.

49:45.986 --> 49:47.863
I understand perfectly.

49:48.030 --> 49:50.699
Very select weddings
no longer have them...

49:50.824 --> 49:53.619
...but for the ordinary people,
we have to show them.

49:53.744 --> 49:54.870
Now...

49:55.120 --> 49:57.539
...about the food, let's see.

49:57.706 --> 50:01.418
What about a large salmon
at either end of the table...

50:01.585 --> 50:04.421
...with the salads in great bowls
in the center?

50:04.588 --> 50:08.800
Another very dramatic arrangement
is cold sturgeon in the middle of the table.

50:09.009 --> 50:12.596
For the ices, we pride ourselves
on a very special effect.

50:12.804 --> 50:13.889
With colored lights...

50:14.097 --> 50:17.392
We didn't intend on having
that kind of reception.

50:23.106 --> 50:25.067
What did you have in mind, madam?

50:25.234 --> 50:29.905
Well, we thought we'd have some
assorted sandwiches. Different kinds.

50:30.113 --> 50:33.575
And some ice cream
and little cakes.

50:33.742 --> 50:35.536
You can have what you wish...

50:35.661 --> 50:39.289
...but that's what we usually serve
for children's parties.

50:39.498 --> 50:41.208
Well, that's what we want.

50:41.458 --> 50:47.881
This 24 Maple Drive...
Is it a club or a country estate?

50:49.091 --> 50:50.926
It's our home.

50:51.426 --> 50:55.764
- What attendance are you anticipating?
- About 250.

50:55.931 --> 50:58.725
- Is it a large house?
- No, it's a small house.

50:58.892 --> 51:02.146
Then you'll be planning
for a marquee on the terrace.

51:02.354 --> 51:04.773
- This, for instance.
- We don't have a terrace.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.569
If they overflow the house,
they could tramp around out on the lawn.

51:09.903 --> 51:11.572
I'll tell you what I'll do.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.741
I'll get our field engineer
to go over the property.

51:14.950 --> 51:16.660
We always have to do that.

51:18.162 --> 51:22.166
<i>The next Saturday, I finally got around
to trying on my old cutaway.</i>

53:02.474 --> 53:04.059
Ellie!

53:04.643 --> 53:07.396
- Ellie!
- Yes, dear?

53:07.563 --> 53:10.732
Ellie! Look, look, look, look!

53:11.024 --> 53:13.652
- What is it?
- I'm in it.

53:13.819 --> 53:15.904
Well, well.

53:16.822 --> 53:18.949
Not so bad, huh?

53:19.158 --> 53:22.244
A little snug,
but maybe I can...

53:22.411 --> 53:25.706
Maybe I could take off a pound or two
before the wedding.

53:25.873 --> 53:27.958
Are you standing naturally?

53:28.125 --> 53:31.670
You look as though you might've been
strapped up by a surgeon.

53:34.464 --> 53:36.425
I was wondering...

53:36.592 --> 53:39.553
...do you think you ought to get
a new one? With Ben...

53:39.720 --> 53:43.765
Nonsense. What are you talking about?
I've only worn this thing twice.

53:43.932 --> 53:46.018
- Stanley...
- Do you realize most men...

53:46.143 --> 53:49.146
...couldn't even get into their cutaway
after 20 years?

53:49.354 --> 53:52.858
If that button gives way,
it's gonna put out somebody's eye.

53:52.983 --> 53:54.359
You know...

53:54.568 --> 53:57.112
...sometimes they wear them
unbuttoned.

53:57.696 --> 53:59.990
I kind of like it unbuttoned,
don't you?

54:00.157 --> 54:02.618
I like it better that way.

54:03.452 --> 54:07.080
Just wait, just wait.
Wait till I have this thing...

54:07.289 --> 54:08.957
...let out just a little.

54:09.124 --> 54:12.127
You'll be surprised.
You wait and see.

54:12.711 --> 54:16.298
Stanley, I want you
to look at these.

54:16.465 --> 54:19.551
Aren't they lovely?
Kay's presents to the bridesmaids.

54:19.718 --> 54:21.762
You'd never dream
they cost only $ 15.

54:21.970 --> 54:22.971
Fifteen dollars?

54:23.180 --> 54:25.015
This is what she's giving Buckley.

54:25.140 --> 54:28.018
She's giving Buck...
She's giving that to Buckley?

54:28.185 --> 54:30.604
The bride always gives
the groom a present.

54:30.813 --> 54:33.190
Can you arrange to meet me
in town on Saturday?

54:33.398 --> 54:36.235
We have to pick out the flat silver
to get it marked.

54:36.443 --> 54:38.403
- The what?
- Kay's flat table silver.

54:38.612 --> 54:41.198
You know we give Kay
the flat silver and the...

54:41.532 --> 54:45.077
Yes. What does Buckley's family give?
Just Buckley?

54:45.285 --> 54:46.245
Just Buckley.

54:46.453 --> 54:47.579
- Mom?
- Yes, dear?

54:47.704 --> 54:50.499
There's a Mr. Massoula
and another guy downstairs.

54:50.666 --> 54:52.793
That's the fellow with the cake.

54:54.461 --> 54:58.048
- Say, come here.
- What's wrong?

54:58.215 --> 55:03.720
I just happened to think, you're going
to get married pretty soon, aren't you?

55:03.887 --> 55:05.681
And then it'll be my turn.

55:05.848 --> 55:08.600
My turn to present you
to the father of the bride...

55:08.767 --> 55:11.145
...as my one and only contribution.

55:11.311 --> 55:13.647
- I feel better, son.
- Stanley?

55:16.024 --> 55:21.363
<i>An experienced caterer can make you
ashamed of your house in 15 minutes.</i>

55:21.864 --> 55:24.491
<i>Ellie was on the verge of tears.</i>

55:25.534 --> 55:27.202
These doors...

55:27.703 --> 55:30.164
They'll have to be taken off
and stored.

55:30.372 --> 55:33.709
Surprising how much circulation
you lose on account of doors.

55:33.876 --> 55:36.170
Especially doors like that.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.757
All I know is, you can't get
more than 125 in the house.

55:40.924 --> 55:44.011
Squash them in like
a lot of bugs if you did.

55:44.845 --> 55:48.015
We were planning to take
some of this furniture upstairs.

55:48.140 --> 55:51.059
We were going to take up
the small chairs and tables...

55:51.185 --> 55:53.896
...and the standing lamp,
and even the rug.

55:54.062 --> 55:56.690
Taking up the rug
ain't gonna give us more room.

55:56.857 --> 55:59.067
Well, have you any suggestions?

55:59.234 --> 56:00.736
Yes, madam, I have.

56:00.861 --> 56:03.113
Even with the marquee,
you'll be cramped.

56:03.322 --> 56:06.742
Joe, go out in the back
and measure for that marquee.

56:06.950 --> 56:09.661
You see, madam,
circulation is your big problem.

56:09.828 --> 56:12.915
The first thing to do
is clear this room of all furniture.

56:13.081 --> 56:15.542
- The settee and the armchair?
- And the piano.

56:15.751 --> 56:18.420
And in the dining room,
the same thing too.

56:18.587 --> 56:21.423
Do you think I have a cold-storage
warehouse upstairs?

56:21.632 --> 56:23.717
I have an attic that's full now.

56:23.884 --> 56:26.428
I suggest you do
what our other clients do.

56:26.595 --> 56:30.641
Hire a moving van to take things out,
then bring them back when it's over.

56:30.807 --> 56:32.809
Now, the marquee.

56:33.519 --> 56:36.688
We'll attach the marquee
to this French door.

56:37.648 --> 56:39.650
- It's stuck.
- It's stuck.

56:39.858 --> 56:41.485
I'll say it is!

56:42.778 --> 56:45.197
Yes, I've been meaning
to get it fixed.

56:45.364 --> 56:47.074
Doesn't matter.
They've got to come off.

56:47.241 --> 56:50.118
It's quite simple.
All you have to do is push them.

56:50.285 --> 56:54.915
Look, you stop! Stop!
Just stop. Stand still.

57:08.011 --> 57:11.598
<i>I decided, after all, I might
as well get a new cutaway.</i>

57:16.395 --> 57:19.231
<i>Every mail brought a new terror.</i>

57:20.190 --> 57:22.734
The Craftons are coming.

57:23.026 --> 57:27.781
The Lewises, the Quincy-Browns
and the Gaylords.

57:28.407 --> 57:30.367
Apparently Kay picked a day...

57:30.534 --> 57:33.620
...when nobody within 400 miles
has got anything to do.

57:33.829 --> 57:36.081
- How nice.
- Somebody refuse?

57:36.248 --> 57:40.252
The Whiteheads were asked to another
wedding and gave it up to come to ours.

57:40.419 --> 57:43.505
The Whiteheads?
They live in Pittsburgh.

57:43.714 --> 57:46.300
What crust! Coming all the way
from Pittsburgh.

57:46.466 --> 57:49.553
Moms! Pops!
Look, I got a present!

57:49.761 --> 57:51.346
A wedding present!

57:51.513 --> 57:55.809
Look, a tray!
A lovely hand-painted tray! Delilah!

57:56.018 --> 57:58.187
Come and see.
Look, I've got a present!

57:58.395 --> 58:00.772
<i>We were not accustomed
to such bounty.</i>

58:00.939 --> 58:03.650
<i>The idea that anyone
should go out and purchase a gift...</i>

58:03.859 --> 58:07.196
<i>... with hard money filled us
with tender gratitude.</i>

58:08.071 --> 58:12.534
<i>For a few days, it looked as if this
might be the last as well as the first...</i>

58:12.659 --> 58:14.495
<i>... but then they began to come in.</i>

58:14.620 --> 58:16.497
<i>A thin trickle at first...</i>

58:17.164 --> 58:19.124
<i>... then more and more.</i>

58:39.520 --> 58:42.815
<i>Given enough ointment,
there's always a fly.</i>

58:42.940 --> 58:47.152
<i>Given enough presents,
there's bound to be a stinker.</i>

58:51.573 --> 58:55.327
- Who sent that?
- With love, from Aunt Hattie.

58:55.494 --> 58:59.748
- Aunt Hattie, huh?
- Kay was expecting a nice, fat check.

58:59.915 --> 59:02.751
When I think of all the guff
I've taken from that...

59:02.918 --> 59:05.879
- What are we gonna do with it?
- Really like me to tell you?

59:06.046 --> 59:08.257
You could always drop it. Kay!

59:08.382 --> 59:12.135
Kay, come take a look
at what Aunt Hattie sent you.

59:12.803 --> 59:14.137
You can send it back.

59:14.304 --> 59:17.474
Darling, no one would take that back
once they got rid of it.

59:17.683 --> 59:19.268
You can send them all back.

59:19.476 --> 59:21.395
The wedding's off.

59:22.146 --> 59:24.189
Kay, what are you saying?

59:24.439 --> 59:25.983
Just that.

59:26.150 --> 59:28.193
I'm not going to marry Buckley.

59:28.402 --> 59:30.571
I found out something
about him that's...

59:30.779 --> 59:32.698
...unforgivable.

59:33.365 --> 59:35.617
- What could've happened?
- I don't know.

59:36.326 --> 59:37.619
Ellie.

59:38.245 --> 59:39.997
Let me go.

59:45.752 --> 59:47.421
Kitten?

59:56.263 --> 59:59.308
Please, Pops.
It's no use talking.

59:59.474 --> 01:00:02.269
I won't talk. I wanna tell you
everything's all right.

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:05.814
Whatever you choose to do,
it's okay with us.

01:00:06.815 --> 01:00:08.650
Thank you, Pops.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.786
You know...

01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:24.500
You always used to talk
about taking a little trip to Europe.

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:26.502
Why don't I fix that up tomorrow?

01:00:26.668 --> 01:00:28.587
You could take a friend with you.

01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:31.757
Pops, I couldn't.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.468
Not after all you've been through.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:37.429
All this horrible expense and everything.

01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:39.890
Heavens! That doesn't matter.

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:44.019
Nothing matters except your happiness.

01:00:44.186 --> 01:00:46.480
We can arrange everything,
make some excuse.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:48.941
Say that you're ill or something.

01:00:49.066 --> 01:00:52.444
We'll send back the presents,
notify the people that are coming.

01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:56.782
Oh, don't.

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:03.205
He should've told me before!

01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:05.958
He shouldn't have kept it from me.

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.919
To have this thing
come out of the blue tonight.

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:12.005
There, there, there.
Don't, don't.

01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:15.509
Nova Scotia for a honeymoon?

01:01:15.676 --> 01:01:18.220
A camp in Nova Scotia!

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:22.641
So he could fish for some horrible
salmon or something.

01:01:23.267 --> 01:01:26.478
He knew I bought millions
of evening clothes and things.

01:01:26.687 --> 01:01:28.438
That didn't matter to him.

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:29.898
Oh, no.

01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:34.611
He loves to go fishing,
so he decides we're going fishing.

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:38.740
Well, after all...

01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:42.077
What do you mean?

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:46.165
Well, I mean, I thought it was
something even worse than that.

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:48.584
Maybe like another girl
or something.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.628
A girl wouldn't be so bad.

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:55.257
At least you could
get your teeth in a girl.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:00.512
But this is our whole lives,
our whole future.

01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:06.185
If he's just this selfish now, so mean
when it's a question of our honeymoon...

01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:09.104
...what's he gonna be like
after we're married?

01:02:09.313 --> 01:02:12.357
- Had you talked it over?
- Of course we had.

01:02:12.566 --> 01:02:15.444
I told him I wanted
to go someplace romantic...

01:02:15.611 --> 01:02:18.030
...but he said there was nothing
as romantic...

01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:21.700
...as a fishing shack in Nova Scotia.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.788
We had a horrible fight.

01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:29.541
I said terrible things to him.

01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:32.711
And he called me a spoiled brat!

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:37.716
I made him stop the car,
and I jumped out and left him right there.

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:48.018
Buckley's here.

01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:50.938
Poor boy's stricken. He looks terrible.

01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:55.150
- Will you see him?
- No. No!

01:03:02.074 --> 01:03:05.244
I never saw anyone who was suffering so.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:07.621
He'll get over it.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.632
- Good evening.
- She won't see you, Buckley.

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:20.884
- Lf I could speak to her...
- It's no use.

01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:24.096
Will you tell her I'm sorry,
she's right about everything?

01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:25.889
I was selfish and pigheaded.

01:03:26.056 --> 01:03:30.060
I didn't realize. I should've asked her.
I'll go anywhere. I'll do anything.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:33.188
Tell her I'm sorry. I want
to take back what I said.

01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:36.233
- Will you tell her that, please?
- Yes, I'll tell her.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.861
- Go home and pull yourself together.
- Thank you.

01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:42.573
- What did you do to your hand?
- Nothing, nothing!

01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.700
Kay slammed the car door on it.

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:47.494
- Good heavens! Let's get some...
- Buckley!

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:49.496
Buckley!

01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:51.623
Oh, darling! Darling!

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.543
- I'm sorry. Forgive me.
- It was my fault. Forgive me.

01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:57.921
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was selfish, pigheaded and stupid.

01:03:58.088 --> 01:03:59.506
- I'm sorry!
- It's all right.

01:03:59.673 --> 01:04:02.467
- I was a spoiled brat.
- We'll go anywhere you want.

01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:05.470
- Does your hand hurt? I'm sorry!
- No, no.

01:04:05.637 --> 01:04:08.223
It doesn't matter just as long
as we're together.

01:04:08.432 --> 01:04:13.353
- I'm sorry, darling! It was all my fault.
- Don't worry. We'll be together forever.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.314
It's all right. It's all right...

01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:18.775
<i>By the wedding rehearsal...</i>

01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:21.445
<i>... everyone but me seemed
to have lost interest.</i>

01:04:21.612 --> 01:04:24.698
<i>And to make it even worse,
it was raining cats and dogs.</i>

01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:28.577
You take the bride's one. You're the one
who knows the Banks family...

01:04:28.744 --> 01:04:30.078
...and where to put this.

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:33.540
Now, the usher for the groom
is Edward owens. Edward owens.

01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:36.502
He couldn't come tonight,
but I'll see him tomorrow.

01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:38.795
- He couldn't come tonight?
- No.

01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:42.007
Great. Now, boys and girls, now listen.

01:04:42.216 --> 01:04:46.970
Now, I'm sure that you want this
to come off perfect in every detail...

01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:49.056
God bless you, darling.
Just as I do.

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:54.978
We're going to just stick here tonight until
we get it right, even if it takes all night.

01:04:56.814 --> 01:04:59.149
- Kay, it's about time. It's...
- I'm sorry.

01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:00.317
Where's Buckley?

01:05:00.484 --> 01:05:03.946
I talked to him on the phone.
He'll try to be here soon as he can.

01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:06.615
- He'll try to be here?
- Let's start rehearsing.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.660
- We can't! The bridegroom isn't here.
- Good evening.

01:05:09.827 --> 01:05:11.703
Half of the wedding party isn't here.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:13.872
Half the wedding party never is here.

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:17.000
Rev. Galsworthy isn't here.
We can't go on without him.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:20.462
It doesn't matter. I take the rehearsal.
It will be all right.

01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:22.840
- Come on.
- You shouldn't be sitting here.

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:26.009
Shouldn't you be up front there?
Why don't you go?

01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:27.845
Come on now. Let's get going.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:30.389
Pop, the bride never rehearses.
It's bad luck.

01:05:30.556 --> 01:05:34.726
Ben, there's no reason why you shouldn't
rehearse. Come on. Get up front.

01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:37.354
- Who's this?
- He belongs up at the altar.

01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:39.565
- Yes, of course.
- Come on, get up there.

01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:43.610
B girl, B girl, get back there. Get back.
Move up front. That's right.

01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:46.780
You come over here and you there.
There, that's right.

01:05:46.905 --> 01:05:49.199
Now, then. Now, then.
Now, we want a bride.

01:05:49.366 --> 01:05:52.619
You'll do. You come over here.
Take Mr. Banks' arm.

01:05:52.744 --> 01:05:54.830
- Then you have to...
- We won't need that.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.291
No, no, it'll be fine tomorrow, I'm sure.

01:05:57.457 --> 01:06:03.463
As we get... Right back, please, Mr. Banks.
There we are. And back. That's right.

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:05.215
That's fine. You stay there.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.719
As to... Pardon me. As to the simple step
that you have to do...

01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:11.555
It's perfectly easy.
You'll all get the hang of it.

01:06:11.722 --> 01:06:14.558
Now, just watch me now.
Girls, watch me very carefully.

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:18.145
Step, stop, and step, stop.

01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:22.399
Step, stop. That's all it is. That's all
there is to it. It's perfectly easy.

01:06:22.566 --> 01:06:26.487
Boys, when I give you the word go,
start with the right foot. Fritz?

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.739
Fritz!

01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:36.955
Now, then, right... oh, no! You don't
hesitate. No, just an ordinary walk.

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:40.209
Just a dignified walk up the aisle.
Go on, get a move on.

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:43.086
That's right. That's good.
You're next in line here.

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:48.008
Another boy with you. Come on, girls.
We're not ready to go. Listen to the music.

01:06:48.175 --> 01:06:51.220
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Right foot.

01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:56.099
- Are you by yourself?
- No.

01:06:56.266 --> 01:07:02.439
No, come on. Come on, girls, here.
There you are. Come on, get a move on.

01:07:02.606 --> 01:07:04.775
Now, the bride and the father.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.904
Now, the right foot, Mr. Banks.
The right foot. Here we go.

01:07:11.156 --> 01:07:13.826
Never mind that. Right foot,
Mr. Banks. Right foot.

01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:18.372
No, the right foot first. Please, it's
quite simple. It is, really, Mr. Banks.

01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.420
Good heavens!
What are you doing?

01:07:25.629 --> 01:07:29.132
- I'm the best man.
- The best man is up here by the altar.

01:07:29.508 --> 01:07:31.677
Boys and girls, each side of the aisle.

01:07:31.885 --> 01:07:35.806
No, boys on that side. The girls...
Yes, bridesmaids there. That's right.

01:07:35.973 --> 01:07:38.100
Come on, over here.
The boys on the right.

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:40.894
There you are. That's right, here.

01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:43.355
You really must practice
at home, Mr. Banks.

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:45.941
There we are. That's right.
You stay there.

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:49.945
Now, so and so and so and so and so.
Then who giveth, and then I do.

01:07:50.154 --> 01:07:54.408
Then you go back and join Mrs. Banks.
No, you don't turn! You back gracefully.

01:07:54.575 --> 01:07:57.619
Very slow. It doesn't matter
which foot first. Then you slide.

01:07:57.828 --> 01:08:01.582
When the ceremony's over, the bridegroom
takes the bride down the aisle.

01:08:01.748 --> 01:08:03.250
Bye, Pops.

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:04.710
I'll be the bridegroom.

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:06.545
Where are you going, Kay?

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:11.008
Then the boys... You take the ladies,
and down you... No, she's gone now.

01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:14.386
She'll be here tomorrow.
Each bridesmaid takes an usher...

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:19.390
...and away you go down... That's right.
You've got it? Yes, you've got it.

01:08:19.558 --> 01:08:21.059
Splendid, splendid.

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:23.228
Yes, you be here tomorrow.

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:26.356
Let's get down to brass tacks
and have a real rehearsal.

01:08:26.523 --> 01:08:29.234
- I thought it was fine.
- Fine? That was a rat race!

01:08:29.443 --> 01:08:33.529
- That wasn't a wedding procession...
- If you'd like to do it again, of course...

01:08:34.238 --> 01:08:37.743
All through, I see. That means
that I'm just in time.

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.246
I'm so sorry. I had a meeting.
But Tringle here is an old hand.

01:08:41.412 --> 01:08:42.872
- They know their stuff?
- Yes.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.457
Good, good, good, good.

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:48.086
I'm sure everything will go smoothly
and be a beautiful wedding.

01:08:48.295 --> 01:08:51.673
- And now I have a meeting.
- Just a moment, Rev. Galsworthy.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.885
We haven't had a rehearsal.
You see, the groom isn't here.

01:08:55.051 --> 01:08:59.180
The groom isn't very important,
is he, my dear?

01:08:59.389 --> 01:09:01.558
You're not nervous? She's not nervous.

01:09:01.725 --> 01:09:04.394
Have your young man call me
in the morning.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.562
That's all right.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.939
And now I must run.
I hate to, but I must.

01:09:08.106 --> 01:09:11.109
Don't worry. Everything will go
beautifully tomorrow.

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:13.237
I know. I've done it before.

01:09:13.403 --> 01:09:15.404
Good luck. Such a beautiful bride.

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:18.200
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
Goodbye!

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:22.746
Chaos!

01:09:22.955 --> 01:09:25.082
Don't worry. You'll have Kay with you.

01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:28.794
She's been a bridesmaid so many times
she could walk up blindfolded.

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:32.464
Absolute, complete chaos.

01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:46.854
<i>When I finally got to sleep that night,
I dreamed of the wedding.</i>

01:09:48.147 --> 01:09:50.149
<i>I was late.</i>

01:09:53.234 --> 01:09:57.281
<i>Somehow I couldn't seem
to move my feet.</i>

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.756
Hi, Pops.

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:40.217
What are you doing here?

01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:43.178
Couldn't sleep. What are you doing?

01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:46.265
I was hungry.

01:11:54.273 --> 01:11:57.985
Pops, I know I'm a fool...

01:11:58.152 --> 01:12:01.738
...but if I tell you something,
you won't think I'm silly, will you?

01:12:01.905 --> 01:12:05.325
Why, of course not, kitten.
What's bothering you?

01:12:05.492 --> 01:12:09.580
I'm scared, Pops, scared to death.

01:12:09.788 --> 01:12:13.417
Why, what are you scared of?
There's nothing to be scared of.

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:18.547
- Marriage is the most normal...
- I know, Pops. I'm not scared of marriage.

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:21.300
It's much sillier than that.

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.302
See, it's this way.

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:27.514
You know how I wanted a simple wedding,
out in the country somewhere?

01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:31.310
Well, that's out. We don't live
in the country, period.

01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:35.481
But this thing's gotten bigger
and bigger and bigger.

01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:38.567
I know it's ungrateful of me...

01:12:38.734 --> 01:12:42.154
...but sometimes it scares
the living daylights out of me.

01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:45.532
You mean, walking down the aisle?

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:48.827
Yeah. Every time I think about it...

01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:51.663
...I break into a cold sweat.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:55.667
Suppose my knees got shaking
just as I started?

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:59.004
Suppose they shook until finally
they let me down entirely?

01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:03.342
You had to drag me down the aisle
like a sack of meal.

01:13:05.093 --> 01:13:08.680
Well, we could always take a short snort
just before the show begins.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:11.308
Oh, Pops!

01:13:11.475 --> 01:13:14.478
Now, look, kitten, get this into your head.

01:13:14.645 --> 01:13:18.065
There is nothing to worry about,
not a thing.

01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:21.944
Whenever you've been bothered,
I've always been around.

01:13:22.152 --> 01:13:25.572
Well, I'll be around when
that wedding march starts too.

01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:29.493
All you have to do is take my arm...

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.579
...and lean against me and relax.

01:13:33.038 --> 01:13:35.207
I'll do the rest.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.836
You are wonderful.

01:13:39.086 --> 01:13:42.256
Nothing ever fazes you, does it?

01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:51.098
<i>The day of the wedding dawned at last.</i>

01:13:53.016 --> 01:13:56.353
- Haven't you got this stuff out?
- I didn't know you were in a hurry.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.858
- We were just relaxing!
- The quicker you get it out, the better.

01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:03.402
No flowers! No flowers!
Take them out of here!

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:06.238
- Hold it, hold it!
- Hey, this stuff's gotta go.

01:14:06.446 --> 01:14:07.906
Hello?

01:14:08.073 --> 01:14:09.616
Hello, Aunt Hattie!

01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:13.453
Well, Aunt Hattie. Yes, this is the day,
Aunt Hattie.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.038
Sorry you couldn't make it.

01:14:15.205 --> 01:14:17.457
What? You're here!

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:21.420
Well, just a minute, Aunt Hattie.

01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:26.049
Where are you, Aunt Hattie? Where?

01:14:26.216 --> 01:14:27.759
At the depot.

01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:30.596
Ben, Ben, Ben! Thank you.

01:14:30.804 --> 01:14:33.015
Aunt Hattie's at the depot.
Go and get her.

01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:36.226
I can't. I gotta get Buckley's things
and bring them here...

01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:38.896
Your domestic staff was to stay
out of the kitchen.

01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:41.940
My domestic staff is getting me
a bicarbonate of soda.

01:14:42.107 --> 01:14:46.069
Take a choice. Wedding banquet or
bicarbonate of soda. You can't have both!

01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:50.407
Aunt Hattie. Hello? Hello, Aunt Hattie.

01:14:50.574 --> 01:14:53.285
- Lf you'll wait outside the station...
- Where's Kay?

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:55.621
- I gotta see her right away.
- Upstairs.

01:14:55.787 --> 01:14:57.289
Somebody will pick you up.

01:14:57.498 --> 01:14:59.249
Yes. Yes.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:00.542
Tommy, Tommy!

01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:03.170
- Aunt Hattie is at the station...
- Forget it.

01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:05.631
I can't, because I gotta borrow
a white shirt.

01:15:05.797 --> 01:15:07.799
Hello, Joe!

01:15:07.966 --> 01:15:11.501
- What are you trying to do? Trip me?
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.014
Joe? Take the pikeway
and turn off at the ramp.

01:15:14.139 --> 01:15:16.099
Yeah, follow Durand for two miles...

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:17.601
Look where you're going!

01:15:17.768 --> 01:15:19.770
- Do you want this stuff moved?
- Yeah.

01:15:19.937 --> 01:15:23.398
- Tell this guy to keep his pots out!
- Ask at any gas station.

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:25.359
I'll tell you as much...

01:15:26.568 --> 01:15:28.654
Why don't you wait with your pots and...?

01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:32.407
Let all these ferns wilt in that sun?
You know how much these cost?

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:34.743
You're not buying it. You're renting it.

01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:38.997
How do you like the nerve of this guy?
There's your boss. He's my boss too!

01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:41.458
Gangway!

01:15:43.836 --> 01:15:46.004
Gangway!

01:15:54.972 --> 01:15:57.057
<i>By 3:00, I was dressed.</i>

01:15:57.182 --> 01:16:01.520
<i>I took the precaution of wearing
a belt and suspenders.</i>

01:16:04.565 --> 01:16:05.691
Ellie.

01:16:05.858 --> 01:16:10.154
Ellie, do you know what time it is? Quarter
past 4. We should be there now.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.281
Hurry up!

01:16:13.157 --> 01:16:16.660
Where is this automobile?

01:16:18.412 --> 01:16:22.082
Well, I'll be...
This is...

01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:24.251
Hello? Hello?

01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:27.880
Operator, will you get me
Jake's Garage, please?

01:16:28.088 --> 01:16:30.841
Well... Well, keep on trying, will you?

01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:32.176
Please keep...

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:37.181
We've got a wedding and no way
to get to the church. No cars!

01:16:37.347 --> 01:16:39.850
Will you do that? Thanks very much.

01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:41.643
Don't worry, darling.

01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:45.272
If there's one thing we know,
they can't start without us.

01:16:45.522 --> 01:16:49.193
<i>I knew I'd never be able to remember
what Ellie wore that day.</i>

01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:52.237
<i>But I also knew I'd never forget
the way she looked...</i>

01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:54.907
<i>... with the beauty of her own
wedding day on her.</i>

01:16:55.073 --> 01:16:57.034
Ellie.

01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:02.539
- Ellie, you look...
- Thank you, darling.

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:05.667
You don't have to say another word.

01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:11.882
You have no right to look like this,
you know. It isn't fair to the bride.

01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:19.598
Hello? Hello, is this Jake's Garage?

01:17:19.807 --> 01:17:21.892
Holy smoke, Aunt Hattie, where are you?

01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:25.813
The cars are here. Never mind.
Kay! Delilah! The cars are here!

01:17:25.979 --> 01:17:30.234
Aunt Hattie's been down at the station.
Wants to know how to get to the church.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.570
- We'll take the first car. Follow with Kay.
- Ellie! Ellie!

01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:36.949
- What am I gonna tell her?
- Tell her to jump in a lake.

01:17:37.115 --> 01:17:39.493
Go outside the station. There's a lake...

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.497
There's some taxis there. Take one
and go to the church. I'll pay for it.

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:45.791
All right, Aunt Hattie. All right.

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:48.794
Kay! Kay, do you know what time it is?

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.339
Kay! Kay, Kay, it's 4:20!

01:17:52.464 --> 01:17:55.259
I'm ready. Come in.

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:02.099
<i>She looked like the princess
in a fairy tale.</i>

01:18:02.307 --> 01:18:06.228
<i>I wouldn't have been surprised if she'd
held out her hand for me to kiss.</i>

01:18:10.607 --> 01:18:15.070
You're wonderful, kitten, just wonderful.

01:18:17.281 --> 01:18:19.324
Thanks, Pops.

01:18:19.741 --> 01:18:21.160
Well, on to the slaughter.

01:18:21.368 --> 01:18:24.329
Yeah, yeah, I guess this is it, isn't it?

01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:26.456
- All right, all right.
- Thank you.

01:18:26.582 --> 01:18:29.042
Take this. Take your bouquet.

01:18:29.251 --> 01:18:30.961
Thanks! Thanks, goodbye!

01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:38.677
- Hello, I'm Duffy, the candid cameraman.
- You destroy that thing.

01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:53.317
- Here they are.
- Kay!

01:18:53.484 --> 01:18:55.944
Just beautiful!

01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:59.031
It's beautiful, Kay.

01:19:00.157 --> 01:19:02.409
Mrs. Banks, it's time.

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:04.411
Coming. Delilah.

01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:06.872
Good luck, Kay.

01:19:27.142 --> 01:19:29.728
Ushers! Ushers, fall in, please.

01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:32.773
Now remember, right foot forward. Go!

01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:38.529
Bridesmaids, bridesmaids, come, come!

01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:41.657
Take your place.
Now, this is the wedding march.

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:45.911
Get ready.

01:19:46.078 --> 01:19:49.331
Right, stop. Left, stop.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.924
Well, Pops, we're off.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.680
Get ready.

01:20:04.847 --> 01:20:09.059
Remember, the right foot forward.
Right foot, right foot!

01:20:09.226 --> 01:20:12.396
Right. Right.

01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:19.862
Right.

01:20:20.487 --> 01:20:21.905
Hold it, Pops.

01:20:46.305 --> 01:20:47.848
<i>Kay overwhelmed me.</i>

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:51.059
<i>She waited for the moment
with the calmness of a general...</i>

01:20:51.268 --> 01:20:54.021
<i>... watching his forces deploy into battle.</i>

01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:57.900
<i>Buckley, on the other hand,
had the haggard look of a man...</i>

01:20:58.108 --> 01:21:01.320
<i>... who had just completed
a dangerous bombing mission.</i>

01:21:02.154 --> 01:21:04.531
Ready?

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:06.301
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:10.055
...and in the face of this company,
to join together...

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:12.641
...this man and this woman
in holy matrimony...

01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:16.979
...which is an honorable estate,
instituted of God, signifying unto us...

01:22:17.104 --> 01:22:20.399
...the mystical union that is betwixt
Christ and his Church.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.986
<i>All I could think of
was the part I had to play.</i>

01:22:24.194 --> 01:22:25.904
<i>I knew I had a cue coming.</i>

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:30.534
<i>When the Rev. Galsworthy asked,
Who giveth this woman?...</i>

01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:32.911
<i>... I had to say, I do.</i>

01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:35.914
<i>It was my only line,
and I wanted to get it right.</i>

01:22:36.123 --> 01:22:40.836
<i>Then I was supposed to drop back a step,
turn and join Ellie in the front pew.</i>

01:22:41.211 --> 01:22:44.882
<i>I couldn't remember what
was immediately in my rear.</i>

01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:46.508
<i>I began to explore.</i>

01:22:46.717 --> 01:22:48.343
<i>I didn't want to trip or fall.</i>

01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:52.514
<i>People are so quick to attribute
such things to alcohol.</i>

01:22:52.723 --> 01:22:55.601
<i>While I was still exploring,
it was on me.</i>

01:22:55.809 --> 01:22:58.896
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

01:22:59.021 --> 01:23:00.939
I do.

01:23:14.786 --> 01:23:17.080
<i>Who giveth this woman?</i>

01:23:17.247 --> 01:23:18.707
<i>This woman.</i>

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:21.418
<i>But she's not a woman. She's still a child.</i>

01:23:21.543 --> 01:23:23.587
<i>And she's leaving us.</i>

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:26.465
<i>What will it be like to come home
and not find her?</i>

01:23:26.632 --> 01:23:30.552
<i>Not to hear her voice calling,
Hi, Pops, as I come in.</i>

01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:34.765
<i>I suddenly realized what I was doing.
I was giving up Kay.</i>

01:23:34.932 --> 01:23:37.643
<i>Something inside me began to hurt.</i>

01:23:38.018 --> 01:23:42.314
- I, Buckley Dunstan...
- I, Buckley Dunstan...

01:23:42.481 --> 01:23:46.068
...take thee, Kathryn Banks...
...take thee, Kathryn Banks...

01:23:46.276 --> 01:23:48.821
...to my wedded wife...
...to my wedded wife...

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:51.824
...to have and to hold...
...to have and to hold...

01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:55.118
...from this day forward.
...from this day forward.

01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:05.128
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:06.839
With this ring, I thee wed.

01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:09.508
- In the name of the Father...
- In the name of the Father...

01:24:09.675 --> 01:24:11.635
...and of the Son...
...and of the Son...

01:24:11.802 --> 01:24:14.138
...and of the Holy Ghost.
...and of the Holy Ghost.

01:24:14.263 --> 01:24:17.516
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:24:17.724 --> 01:24:20.352
For as much as Buckley Dunstan
and Kathryn Banks...

01:24:20.519 --> 01:24:23.105
...have consented together
in holy wedlock...

01:24:23.313 --> 01:24:25.357
...I pronounce they are
man and wife...

01:24:25.566 --> 01:24:31.029
...in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:38.787
God the Father, God the Son,
God the Holy Ghost...

01:24:38.996 --> 01:24:41.582
...bless and preserve and keep you.

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:44.459
The Lord mercifully with his favor
look upon you...

01:24:44.626 --> 01:24:47.588
...and fill you with spiritual benediction
and grace...

01:24:48.172 --> 01:24:51.008
...that ye may so live together
in this life...

01:24:51.175 --> 01:24:55.929
...that in the world to come,
ye may have life everlasting.

01:24:56.096 --> 01:24:58.015
Amen.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:44.728
<i>Now the race was on to get back
to the house and the free champagne.</i>

01:25:54.655 --> 01:25:56.365
<i>The house was bursting at the seams.</i>

01:25:56.532 --> 01:25:59.910
<i>Everywhere there were faces.
Most of them I'd never seen before.</i>

01:26:00.077 --> 01:26:04.623
<i>I wondered if someone had broadcast
a general invitation by radio.</i>

01:26:06.959 --> 01:26:12.464
<i>The temperature under the marquee was
between a Turkish bath and a greenhouse.</i>

01:26:15.467 --> 01:26:17.553
<i>No one was listening to the orchestra.</i>

01:26:17.761 --> 01:26:21.140
<i>Ellie could have saved that 85 bucks.</i>

01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:31.483
<i>The caterer was having trouble.</i>

01:26:31.692 --> 01:26:34.611
<i>Something was wrong, very wrong,
with his circulation.</i>

01:26:34.778 --> 01:26:35.821
Yes, yes!

01:26:35.988 --> 01:26:40.075
Ladies, I must insist that you pass
through the doorway, please.

01:26:42.119 --> 01:26:44.121
<i>There was nothing wrong
with the waiters.</i>

01:26:44.288 --> 01:26:48.417
<i>The moment a person tilted a glass,
they were waiting with a fresh supply.</i>

01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:52.588
<i>Never have I seen men
more devoted to their work.</i>

01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:57.259
<i>I was looking for Kay.
I still hadn't kissed the bride.</i>

01:26:58.802 --> 01:27:02.639
Well, you know, Mikhail's daughter
moved into the palace, and they...

01:27:02.806 --> 01:27:06.810
- Where's Kay? I can't find her.
- In the garden, having their pictures taken.

01:27:06.977 --> 01:27:09.021
First will you see about the champagne?

01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:11.773
You'd think they were working
on a piece basis.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.818
- See about it, will you?
- All right, all right.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:28.248
- How's the champagne holding up?
- Okay, okay, mister. Don't worry.

01:27:28.457 --> 01:27:31.543
- You'll get yours.
- Edith! Edith, hurry up!

01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:34.880
- I got mine. I just...
- Kay's going to throw the bouquet!

01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:41.011
I want to see this.

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:54.942
- Where's Pops? I don't see him.
- I haven't seen him either.

01:27:57.069 --> 01:27:59.196
Can I get in?

01:27:59.363 --> 01:28:01.114
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

01:28:15.295 --> 01:28:18.507
Where on earth have you been?
Kay just threw her bouquet!

01:28:18.715 --> 01:28:22.553
Ellie, look, please be nice to me.
For once in your life, be nice to me.

01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:25.389
No, you can't go up now.
She's changing her clothes.

01:28:26.431 --> 01:28:28.600
<i>The reception had turned into a party.</i>

01:28:28.809 --> 01:28:33.647
<i>I was skulking around the edges,
still waiting for a chance to see Kay.</i>

01:28:36.066 --> 01:28:40.028
They're going! They're going!
Come and get your confetti!

01:28:42.072 --> 01:28:44.116
Get your confetti, everybody!

01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:46.493
Come on, get your confetti!

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.663
Get it while it lasts! It's going fast!

01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:39.004
<i>She was gone. My Kay was gone.</i>

01:29:39.213 --> 01:29:42.633
<i>And I'd been too late
to say goodbye to her.</i>

01:29:50.057 --> 01:29:52.100
<i>When the last guest had gone...</i>

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:55.020
<i>... and the last glass of champagne
had been drunk...</i>

01:29:55.187 --> 01:29:57.189
<i>... we surveyed the wreckage.</i>

01:29:57.356 --> 01:30:02.027
I suppose we'd better clean up and not
leave this mess for Delilah tomorrow.

01:30:02.194 --> 01:30:06.490
I'll go up and change my dress.
Would you get the vacuum, darling?

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:11.495
Funny how empty a house
can suddenly get, isn't it?

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.872
I'm sorry you missed
saying goodbye to her.

01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:15.415
It's all right.

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:19.002
I think she'll be happy with him,
and that's the important thing.

01:30:19.169 --> 01:30:21.630
Sure, sure, sure.

01:30:22.256 --> 01:30:25.092
Ellie, look.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.397
Hello.

01:30:39.064 --> 01:30:41.775
Hello, kitten!

01:30:42.192 --> 01:30:43.277
Where are you?

01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:45.821
New York.
Our train's leaving in a second.

01:30:46.029 --> 01:30:49.074
I just couldn't leave without
saying goodbye to you.

01:30:49.283 --> 01:30:52.661
I'm coming. Pops, say goodbye
again to Moms.

01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:55.289
And thank her for all she did.

01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:59.209
And, Pops, you've been just wonderful.

01:30:59.376 --> 01:31:00.878
I love you.

01:31:01.044 --> 01:31:02.588
I love you very much.

01:31:03.589 --> 01:31:05.924
Goodbye, kitten.

01:31:06.675 --> 01:31:08.177
Catch a lot of fish.

01:31:08.302 --> 01:31:10.220
Bye-bye.

01:31:18.562 --> 01:31:20.606
All right now?

01:31:20.814 --> 01:31:23.650
Nothing's really changed, has it?

01:31:27.779 --> 01:31:29.656
You know what they say:

01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:32.075
My son's my son
until he gets him a wife...

01:31:32.242 --> 01:31:35.954
...but my daughter's my daughter
all of her life.

01:31:36.163 --> 01:31:38.540
All of our life.
