WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.969
You have got a whole lot
of dead people around you.

00:03.971 --> 00:07.523
There is
a spiritual battle taking place.

00:07.525 --> 00:09.308
We might be
the first people

00:09.310 --> 00:11.143
to investigate the Borden house,

00:11.145 --> 00:14.146
not looking for the Bordens.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.782
Wait.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.067
Put your arm up like this.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.486
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:21.689 --> 00:24.223
There's absolutely something
in this back room.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.941
She took her husband's
straight razor

00:25.943 --> 00:27.776
and slit her throat.

00:27.778 --> 00:28.961
Something
moved in that room

00:28.963 --> 00:30.329
while I was sleeping.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.435
I am Amy Bruni.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.737
I was only 8 when
a paranormal incident

00:38.739 --> 00:40.472
changed my life forever.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.809
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:43.811 --> 00:47.629
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.264
I'm Adam Berry.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.817
More than a decade ago,
an encounter in gettysburg

00:51.819 --> 00:54.186
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.304
Together,
we uncover the truth

00:56.306 --> 00:57.923
behind the unexplainable.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.925
Oh, my god.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.861
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:04.114 --> 01:06.915
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:06.917 --> 01:11.136
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.886
So I received a call
from a woman named Sue.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.890
She is having a lot of activity.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.809
The interesting twist
in this case is that

01:33.811 --> 01:36.311
Sue believes there is
some sort of spiritual battle

01:36.313 --> 01:37.863
going on where she works.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.347
Where does she work?

01:39.349 --> 01:42.651
This woman works
at the Lizzie Borden house.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.736
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.322
Oh, okay.
Now I see what's happening.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.158
Everyone in the country

01:49.160 --> 01:51.977
knows something
about Lizzie Borden.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.413
People think
she actually murdered

01:54.415 --> 01:55.831
her father and stepmother.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.716
She wasn't convicted
of the crime,

01:57.718 --> 02:01.703
and she was able to live
the rest of her life.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.538
This place is really active,

02:03.540 --> 02:05.474
and we've been here before.

02:05.476 --> 02:09.178
We feel we talked to
the Borden family before.

02:09.180 --> 02:12.314
We're sitting in a restaurant
that used to be a church.

02:12.316 --> 02:13.098
Yep.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.733
This was...

02:14.735 --> 02:17.769
Where Lizzie Borden was
a parishioner.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.822
That is so awesome.

02:19.824 --> 02:23.058
So, Sue, on many occasions,

02:23.060 --> 02:25.077
had psychics
randomly come up to her

02:25.079 --> 02:28.396
and tell her that activity is
happening around her more

02:28.398 --> 02:30.749
because her grandparents are
actually with her...

02:30.751 --> 02:32.000
Wow, okay.

02:32.002 --> 02:34.586
Protecting her
from whatever is going on

02:34.588 --> 02:36.171
at the Lizzie Borden house.

02:36.173 --> 02:39.341
Is she like a tour guide, or...
She's a tour guide.

02:39.343 --> 02:42.461
I mean, doesn't that
really come with the territory?

02:42.463 --> 02:43.912
I mean,
she's in a haunted place.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.381
There's rumors going around that
people that work there

02:46.383 --> 02:50.686
have more issues...
Strokes, like deaths.

02:50.688 --> 02:54.022
I don't think
we've ever heard of that.

02:54.024 --> 02:56.225
So I think she's starting
to become afraid that

02:56.227 --> 02:58.060
that is what her grandparents

02:58.062 --> 02:59.094
might be protecting her from.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.313
Oh. Wow.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.481
Then that's a problem.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.199
I think we might be
the first people

03:04.201 --> 03:06.451
to investigate the Borden house,

03:06.453 --> 03:08.487
but we're not looking
for the Bordens.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.938
I don't know if
that's ever happened.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.290
No, and that's incredible.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.624
I mean that's not to say
that the Bordens

03:12.626 --> 03:13.792
aren't gonna pop in.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.962
Maybe we get to ask the Bordens

03:16.964 --> 03:19.114
to help us in the investigation.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.132
Yeah.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.616
I mean, I don't think
I've ever been like,

03:21.618 --> 03:26.121
"Hi. We know you're here.
Can you help us with this case?"

03:26.123 --> 03:27.089
Yeah.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.658
Being in
the Lizzie Borden house,

03:46.660 --> 03:49.311
most paranormal investigators
all over the world

03:49.313 --> 03:51.863
traveled here just
to investigate in this house.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.865
It's strange to be here
and not necessarily

03:53.867 --> 03:55.617
be looking for the Bordens,

03:55.619 --> 03:58.987
but Sue feels as though
her family is haunting her,

03:58.989 --> 04:01.323
but that somehow,
the Borden house has

04:01.325 --> 04:02.841
drawn them to her.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.761
It's our job to figure out
<i>if</i> her grandparents are here

04:05.763 --> 04:08.547
and <i> why</i> her grandparents
are here.

04:08.549 --> 04:13.435
You're saying you've had
multiple people tell you that

04:13.437 --> 04:15.337
- your grandparents are here.
- Yes.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.923
And what was
your grandparents name?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.309
Irene and William.

04:20.310 --> 04:21.944
My grandmother,
I call her "meme,"

04:21.946 --> 04:24.146
and "pepe"...
My grandfather.

04:24.148 --> 04:25.347
Like, I'll be doing tours,

04:25.349 --> 04:28.183
and I'll be getting
psychics tell me,

04:28.185 --> 04:30.502
your grandparents are here,
protecting you.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.571
Protecting from what?

04:32.573 --> 04:34.539
Um... i mean,
different people

04:34.541 --> 04:37.492
have had medical problems
who work here.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.544
We've had a tour guide die.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.029
One had two strokes.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.748
Are my grandparents
trying to tell me,

04:42.750 --> 04:43.915
maybe I shouldn't
be working here

04:43.917 --> 04:45.851
for reasons like that, you know.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.754
And then this one guy he said,
my grandparents

04:48.756 --> 04:52.858
are in a spiritual battle
with Andrew, Lizzie's father.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.059
- Really.
- Yeah.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.194
And this is actually
where he was killed.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.101
- It's a little creepy down here.
- Yeah.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.971
I was leading a tour
down here at night

05:05.973 --> 05:08.674
and an orb shot out
like between these boxes.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.075
It paused right in front of me,

05:10.077 --> 05:12.944
and it shot through that hole
in the bricks right there.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.380
And as I reeled back from that,

05:15.382 --> 05:17.849
a second one shot up,
did the same thing.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.451
- Okay.
- Weird.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.853
And they believe that
the murder weapon was a hatchet

05:21.855 --> 05:24.489
that was found right
at the entrance to this room.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.290
Oh, really?

05:31.015 --> 05:33.131
Well, this was
the Borden's guest bedroom

05:33.133 --> 05:35.784
and...

05:35.786 --> 05:37.035
The morning of the murders,

05:37.037 --> 05:39.504
Abby Borden had come up here
to make up this bed,

05:39.506 --> 05:41.573
and this is the room that
she was actually killed in.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.042
They used a hatchet?

05:44.044 --> 05:48.063
Right. She was struck a total
of 18 times above her head,

05:48.065 --> 05:49.498
and once between
her shoulder blades.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.284
Oh, my god.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.419
Have you had any experiences
in this room?

05:54.421 --> 05:55.887
- I have.
- Okay.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.324
Sometimes, I'm being poked
in the back or hit in the back.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.492
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:02.546 --> 06:04.145
This used to be
Mr. Borden's bedroom.

06:04.147 --> 06:06.498
You had
an experience in this room?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.332
I did.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.900
I sat down on the bed here

06:08.902 --> 06:10.718
and, all of a sudden,
a black mist

06:10.720 --> 06:14.056
came right across the bed,
right on the side of me.

06:14.058 --> 06:15.290
That is crazy.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.858
Like, you know
how smoke is grayish?

06:16.860 --> 06:18.276
It was really a black.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.428
Okay.

06:19.430 --> 06:22.581
And it was just, like,
swirling in place.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.965
Okay.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.667
Scared the heck out of me.

06:25.669 --> 06:26.885
I jumped up.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.054
I ran up to the attic.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.356
And when I got upstairs,

06:31.358 --> 06:33.325
I turned around...

06:33.327 --> 06:36.361
That mist was just right
in the middle of the doorway.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.863
So it was, like,
blocking your way out.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.132
It was
the only way out, yeah.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.533
What did you do?

06:41.535 --> 06:44.002
I was trying to figure out
what do I do?

06:44.004 --> 06:45.437
Do I run through this thing?

06:45.439 --> 06:47.806
And as I'm thinking about
what am I going to do,

06:47.808 --> 06:48.974
the thing moved out
of the doorway,

06:48.976 --> 06:50.342
and it went into that last room.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.176
Okay.

06:54.064 --> 06:55.514
Usually I don't spend
the night with the guests.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.149
I go home to my own house.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.484
Well this particular night,
the owner, leanne,

06:59.486 --> 07:01.686
had said, "Sue, you're the
tour guide on tomorrow night.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.921
So you're going to have
to spend the night

07:02.923 --> 07:04.356
in the house
with the guests."

07:04.358 --> 07:05.657
I asked my niece Cindy

07:05.659 --> 07:07.159
to join me for the tour
that night,

07:07.161 --> 07:09.761
and spend the night
in this room with me.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.397
And I had put my cell phone
down on the nightstand.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.066
I reached over
to get my cell phone

07:15.068 --> 07:16.501
and it was like
I got electrocuted.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.403
I said, Cindy, come here.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.671
She got up off the bed
and walked around

07:19.673 --> 07:20.906
and she's like,
"What, auntie?"

07:20.908 --> 07:23.074
I said put your hand out.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.543
She pulled it back and said
"Oh, my God.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.978
It's like
I got electrocuted."

07:26.980 --> 07:28.547
And as she said that,

07:28.549 --> 07:31.316
every light in this entire
attic went out.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.118
Oh, jeez.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.120
We grabbed all of our things
and said, "Forget that.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.955
Let's go downstairs."

07:36.957 --> 07:39.491
But when we got
to the second floor landing,

07:39.493 --> 07:41.226
every light in the attic
came back on

07:41.228 --> 07:42.394
and all the lights
from the second

07:42.396 --> 07:44.095
to the first floor went out.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.730
- Oh, jeez.
- Yeah.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.499
And so, now you'll never
come back up here

07:47.501 --> 07:48.633
and stay at night.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.036
I do not like the feeling
up here at all.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.139
I mean are you worried about
ever having to quit this job?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.242
Well, if it's gonna
affect people's health

07:57.244 --> 07:59.394
or something like that,
then yeah.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.847
You know,
I just want to find out

08:01.849 --> 08:04.883
if these relatives of mine
are here.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.951
I just want to know
what's going on.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.487
- Why are they here?
- Okay.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.922
Sue's fears
are a major concern,

08:10.924 --> 08:14.359
especially if other tour guides
face the same threats.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.760
Let's go on channel 3.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.462
Adam is going to set up
our equipment

08:17.464 --> 08:18.663
while I talk to Rick,

08:18.665 --> 08:22.133
a longtime employee
of the Borden house.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.969
There may be a connection
between the house

08:23.971 --> 08:25.837
and the well-being
of its employees,

08:25.839 --> 08:28.607
but right now,
there's no way to tell for sure.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.808
- Rick.
- I'm Amy.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.443
Good to meet you.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.812
Do you feel like Sue
has more activity around her

08:33.813 --> 08:35.514
than other tour guides?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.232
Yeah, we like to say
she's like a magnet.

08:37.234 --> 08:40.184
It seems like when she's around,
things happen.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.254
I don't know why that is,
but she's like a magnet.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.121
What kind of things
have happened to people

08:44.124 --> 08:46.024
that spend a lot of time here?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.993
People that have worked here
have had

08:47.995 --> 08:49.794
tragic things happen
in their lives.

08:49.796 --> 08:50.896
One of our tour guides

08:50.898 --> 08:52.597
who had worked here
for a long time,

08:52.599 --> 08:55.667
she had left and moved away
she came back,

08:55.669 --> 08:57.485
and started working here again.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.821
And within two months,
she lost two of her family.

08:59.823 --> 09:03.224
She lost her mom and her dad
within two or three months.

09:03.226 --> 09:05.577
I mean, when my wife
started working here,

09:05.579 --> 09:07.028
that's when a lot
of our problems started.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.831
Really.
Does she still work here?

09:09.833 --> 09:11.616
No, unfortunately,

09:11.618 --> 09:13.668
she had some health issues
a couple years ago,

09:13.670 --> 09:15.053
and she hasn't been
able to work.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.355
And see, I begin to wonder
about things, you know,

09:17.357 --> 09:19.874
and that maybe there's
something else going on here

09:19.876 --> 09:21.526
that's affecting people
that are working here.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.644
- Right.
- I hate to think that.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.045
- I don't want to think that.
- Of course not.

09:24.047 --> 09:26.998
But you can't help but wonder
if there's anything more

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
to what's going on here
than meets the eye.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.302
Right, exactly.

09:32.222 --> 09:34.673
Sue's not the only one
that believes these rumors,

09:34.675 --> 09:37.208
but we're not totally convinced.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.477
If she's in danger,
we need to determine

09:39.479 --> 09:41.413
whether her grandparents
are here.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.748
And if so, are they here
to protect her?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.384
All right, so we have how many?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.752
We have six cameras
all together, right?

09:47.754 --> 09:50.455
Right, everything visual
that she spoke of,

09:50.457 --> 09:52.123
or when she had her
crazy experience,

09:52.125 --> 09:53.358
we've got that covered
on camera.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.010
Okay. So I feel
like tonight,

09:56.012 --> 09:57.629
I think we should start
in his room,

09:57.631 --> 09:59.197
where she had
the weird black mist.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.665
Yeah, I want to see
that black mist.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.868
That's the first thing
we need to check off the list.

10:03.870 --> 10:07.389
Sue talks to us
about the swirling black mist.

10:07.391 --> 10:10.775
We have this sls camera
that picks up anomalies

10:10.777 --> 10:12.310
and then make them
stick figures.

10:12.312 --> 10:16.014
So Amy and I are going to see
if we get any activity.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.736
I'm Adam and this is Amy.

10:21.738 --> 10:22.988
Hi.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.173
And we were here earlier
with Sue.

10:25.175 --> 10:28.960
She was taking us through
and telling us the experiences

10:28.962 --> 10:32.330
that she has had in this house.

10:32.332 --> 10:36.534
And she seems to think that
it's her grandparents.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.987
We know that people come in here
and they investigate

10:38.989 --> 10:41.239
and they want to talk
to the Bordens.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.208
If any of you are here,
you know,

10:43.210 --> 10:45.744
feel free to reach out,

10:45.746 --> 10:49.831
because we're looking
for William or Irene.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.751
And maybe you can tell us
that they're here.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.743
It's so important
that you talk to us.

11:01.745 --> 11:05.196
We just really need
your help on this one.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.137
Hey, there's something
in the hallway.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.738
I see it.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.040
Just walk a little bit closer.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.508
I can see you.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.576
You're standing right there.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.412
Can you walk closer
to us, please?

11:20.414 --> 11:24.149
Just come closer.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.218
Can you wave?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.037
Put your arm up like this?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.958
As high up as you can put it.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.326
Oh, it's doing it.
It is doing it.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.227
Whoa!

11:38.699 --> 11:39.864
- It just... Oh!
- Oh!

11:46.173 --> 11:47.822
Just walk a little bit closer.

11:47.824 --> 11:51.376
I can see you.
You're standing right there.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.246
Can you walk closer
to us, please?

11:55.248 --> 11:58.366
Can you wave?

11:58.368 --> 12:02.604
Put your arm up like this.

12:02.606 --> 12:03.738
Whoa!

12:03.740 --> 12:04.723
Arm up.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.026
He put his arm up all the way

12:08.028 --> 12:10.695
and then disappeared.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.098
That was freaky.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.699
Here, come around this way
on my side.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.724
We're going to be able
to see you a little bit better

12:22.726 --> 12:26.878
if you can just step out
of the darkness a little bit.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.812
Come on.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.380
You can touch me.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.155
I see it.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.890
What's your name?

12:41.328 --> 12:44.729
Sue has been told by many people

12:44.731 --> 12:49.400
that her grandparents are here,
protecting her.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.735
Do you know them?

12:53.089 --> 12:55.106
This is your chance to help us

12:55.108 --> 12:58.409
help someone who works here.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.011
You can do some good.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.331
Instead of <i> you</i> helping <i> us,</i>
you're gonna help <i> Sue.</i>

13:05.152 --> 13:06.584
Are we making sense?

13:06.586 --> 13:09.254
Can you just make
a loud noise somewhere

13:09.256 --> 13:14.225
if you're willing to help us?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.260
Oh, I lost one.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.930
All right, something
just touched my shoulder.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.701
- Your right shoulder?
- My right shoulder.

13:23.703 --> 13:24.602
Right here.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.258
Yeah, one moves off the screen.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.644
And then something
touched my shoulder.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.728
Okay.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.380
And they're both gone now.

13:37.617 --> 13:41.352
Nothing. They're gone.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.154
- Let's play this back.
- Yeah.

13:58.705 --> 13:59.771
What did it say?

13:59.773 --> 14:00.939
I don't know.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.615
- "Don't need to"?
- Yeah.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.983
That's what it sounds like.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.525
Okay.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.460
"Don't need to."

14:22.462 --> 14:24.295
Yeah. He's like,
I don't need to.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.463
It sounded like a man.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.564
Yeah.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.500
What do you think it was?

14:29.502 --> 14:30.869
I don't know.

14:30.871 --> 14:35.723
I think the most important thing
for them to know is,

14:35.725 --> 14:39.761
they are investigating with us.

14:39.763 --> 14:41.412
We're no longer
reaching out for them,

14:41.414 --> 14:45.216
this is the first time
that we are asking

14:45.218 --> 14:48.686
whoever's here
to investigate with us,

14:48.688 --> 14:51.756
give us answers
that's not about themselves.

14:51.758 --> 14:52.590
Right. Okay.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.009
Okay.

14:55.011 --> 14:56.194
Let's go to the attic.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.546
Whatever we just
caught on the sls camera

14:58.548 --> 15:00.832
was interacting with us,
but then it ran off.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.935
Sue said the black mist
went upstairs into the attic.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.905
Maybe the spirits we saw
just did the same thing.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.441
I'm gonna put this over here.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.378
I'm going to put
the spirit box right here.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.980
A spirit box rapidly scans
through radio frequencies,

15:15.982 --> 15:18.833
theoretically allowing spirits
to manipulate the white noise

15:18.835 --> 15:22.287
and form responses.

15:22.289 --> 15:27.458
Okay, whoever's in here,
can you talk to us using this?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.800
Do you know Sue?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.638
What's your name?

15:43.243 --> 15:46.144
If you are Sue's grandparents,

15:46.146 --> 15:47.345
please reach out

15:47.347 --> 15:49.180
if you have something
you'd like to say.

15:59.743 --> 16:02.527
Why is it so quiet?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.495
I think it's a good time
to let it chill out.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.531
It knows what we want now.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.549
And we have stuff
to do tomorrow,

16:08.551 --> 16:11.903
because we've got to start
doing our research.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.871
All right.
Shall we then?

16:13.873 --> 16:15.340
Yeah.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.841
Last time
Sue spent the night,

16:16.843 --> 16:19.310
she had one
of her worst experiences.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.314
We're going to hunker down
in a room

16:23.316 --> 16:25.450
with the cameras and recorders
still going.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.386
If anything happens,
we want to be here to catch it.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.303
Amy and I know a lot
about the Borden legend.

16:45.305 --> 16:49.157
However, we don't really know
anything about Sue's family.

16:49.159 --> 16:50.508
Learning more about
her grandparents

16:50.510 --> 16:52.777
will make it easier
to connect with them.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.662
So I'm going to meet
with Sue's niece to see

16:54.664 --> 16:56.914
if we can get any more
information from her.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.851
Cindy, thank you
for meeting with me today.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.020
Has she talked to you about
thinking her grandparents

17:02.022 --> 17:03.154
are here with her at times?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.204
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:04.207 --> 17:06.357
And what were they like?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.393
William loved
all the grandchildren.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.394
Yeah.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.795
All the kids would
sit around him

17:10.797 --> 17:13.464
and he was a great, fun guy.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.566
Okay, what
about her grandmother.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.469
Any, like, really fond memories?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.704
Not that I can remember.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.107
Do you think
her grandparents are here?

17:23.108 --> 17:24.492
Absolutely.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.914
We haven't had any luck
contacting the Bordens for help.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.567
So I have a historian
coming to visit,

17:32.569 --> 17:34.836
because who knows
what we'll find as far

17:34.838 --> 17:36.220
as what happened nearby,

17:36.222 --> 17:37.655
you know, other people
who lived here,

17:37.657 --> 17:38.940
you know, extended family.

17:38.942 --> 17:41.526
Anyone attached to this house
who might help us.

17:41.528 --> 17:46.214
We all know the story to
the notorious Borden murders,

17:46.216 --> 17:49.617
but is there anything else
historically significant?

17:49.619 --> 17:51.586
- Andrew's uncle...
- Okay.

17:51.588 --> 17:53.921
Lawdwick,
he owned the house next door,

17:53.923 --> 17:56.574
which I believe
is still that house.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.962
His second wife, Eliza, had
had three children.

18:00.964 --> 18:03.064
She took them down
to the basement

18:03.066 --> 18:06.300
and threw them into the cistern,

18:06.302 --> 18:10.154
which is kind of like
an indoor well.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.857
Two of them actually died,

18:12.859 --> 18:15.760
and then she took her
husband's straight razor

18:15.762 --> 18:16.661
and slit her throat.

18:27.307 --> 18:31.459
What big things have
you learned, Mr. Berry?

18:31.461 --> 18:33.394
I talked to Cindy, Sue's niece,

18:33.396 --> 18:37.431
and she told me a little bit
about Sue's grandparents,

18:37.433 --> 18:39.634
William and Irene.

18:39.636 --> 18:42.703
It seems like both of them
were extremely caring,

18:42.705 --> 18:44.705
you know, William specifically,

18:44.707 --> 18:47.308
the kids gathered around him.

18:47.310 --> 18:50.111
It's a little insight
on his personality,

18:50.113 --> 18:51.979
I guess, that maybe we can use.

18:51.981 --> 18:53.264
I mean, did you
find out anything?

18:53.266 --> 18:54.615
I did.

18:54.617 --> 18:58.136
I found out that the Bordens
were not the only deaths.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.322
Next door,
Lizzie Borden's aunt Eliza

19:01.324 --> 19:02.473
had three kids.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.142
And she went down
to their basement

19:05.144 --> 19:08.763
and threw them all
in the cistern.

19:08.765 --> 19:12.066
And so the 3-year-old was able
to make her way out.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.019
The 1-year-old
and the baby died.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.839
And then Eliza slit
her own throat.

19:17.841 --> 19:19.256
- Oh, God!
- And killed herself.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.992
- That is disgusting.
- I mean, that's crazy.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.427
So, you know, we have some new

19:23.429 --> 19:26.147
potential people
to reach out to.

19:31.688 --> 19:33.421
We're trying to get
in touch with anyone

19:33.423 --> 19:37.275
who will speak to us
about Sue's grandparents.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.510
Hopefully,
this new information helps.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.895
Before we get started,

19:40.897 --> 19:44.048
we need to review the audio
and the footage from last night.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.035
I was listening to the audio,

19:48.037 --> 19:51.539
and there's a really
loud crazy sound

19:51.541 --> 19:53.858
in the room with me.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.543
I'll just play it for you.

19:58.848 --> 20:01.232
I mean, it sounds like...

20:01.234 --> 20:03.150
- A dragging.
- Something dragging.

20:03.152 --> 20:05.169
A door, it's like...

20:06.956 --> 20:08.489
It's so loud.

20:08.491 --> 20:11.125
And, like, I can hear
me moving around in bed,

20:11.127 --> 20:13.978
and it's a lot softer.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.129
Okay.

20:15.131 --> 20:19.066
Can you bring up
the camera of me sleeping?

20:19.068 --> 20:22.753
Let's go to 3:56
in the A.M.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.574
Nothing's moving.

20:26.576 --> 20:29.143
Nothing else is moving,
your bag doesn't move.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.862
I don't see anything moving.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.681
It's very clear that
it is not me.

20:33.683 --> 20:34.849
That's the big thing.

20:34.851 --> 20:36.817
So let's go up there
and find out...

20:36.819 --> 20:38.152
- Yeah.
- What's up there.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.554
Let's start up there, see if
we can recreate that sound.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.793
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:45.795 --> 20:48.462
First things first.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.931
Nope, nope.

20:54.137 --> 20:56.604
That sounds
a little bit more apt.

20:56.606 --> 20:57.905
- Maybe the other room?
- Yeah.

20:57.907 --> 21:00.474
'Cause it was kind of
on this side.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.010
No.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.078
How about this door?

21:04.080 --> 21:05.746
- Oh!
- Oh!

21:10.386 --> 21:11.686
Oh, yeah.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.720
Oh, yeah.

21:12.722 --> 21:13.955
Barely move it.

21:14.958 --> 21:15.990
Yeah.

21:15.992 --> 21:17.391
That's creepy.

21:17.393 --> 21:20.695
- Let's listen.
- That's it.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.596
The recorder...
It's going to match.

21:28.738 --> 21:31.238
Go back. Go back.
I want to hear it.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.508
That's it.

21:39.615 --> 21:42.516
Adam and I tried
to recreate that sound.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.619
We think it was a door
being moved.

21:45.621 --> 21:46.954
Of course these things
were off-camera,

21:46.956 --> 21:48.255
because that's the way it goes.

21:48.257 --> 21:50.691
But I have no doubt
something moved in that room

21:50.693 --> 21:51.926
while I was sleeping.

21:51.928 --> 21:53.260
That's really creepy.

21:53.262 --> 21:54.462
Yeah.

21:54.464 --> 21:56.197
Maybe we should
leave this recorder up here

21:56.199 --> 21:58.499
while we go do some other stuff.

21:58.501 --> 21:59.800
Yeah.

21:59.802 --> 22:01.135
Let it do its thing.

22:01.137 --> 22:04.438
And then, maybe, let's go down
to where Abby was killed.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.307
Yeah, let's do that.

22:08.144 --> 22:11.579
This is
the boarding house.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.280
We're going to witness
paranormal activity.

22:13.282 --> 22:14.749
That's not a question.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.817
But nothing
we've witnessed so far

22:16.819 --> 22:19.653
makes us believe
its Sue's grandparents.

22:19.655 --> 22:22.023
Sue mentioned being poked
in Abby's room.

22:22.025 --> 22:23.624
If whatever is here is
powerful enough

22:23.626 --> 22:25.393
to make physical contact,

22:25.395 --> 22:28.029
maybe we'll be lucky enough
to get a response.

22:28.031 --> 22:29.697
- All right.
- I'll move this here.

22:29.699 --> 22:31.699
Abby Borden's room.

22:37.507 --> 22:43.010
We're still here,
whoever has been around us.

22:43.012 --> 22:47.681
We're here to talk
to anyone related to Sue.

22:49.452 --> 22:52.253
If any of the Bordens are here,

22:52.255 --> 22:53.721
can you join us for a second?

22:53.723 --> 22:56.290
You can help us...

22:56.292 --> 22:58.526
If you could tell anyone
that's connected to Sue,

22:58.528 --> 23:00.594
a family member...
Maybe Irene or William...

23:00.596 --> 23:03.064
To come in here with us.

23:03.066 --> 23:05.733
Is there anything
that you want to say to us?

23:09.539 --> 23:13.240
Is Eliza in here with us?

23:13.242 --> 23:15.376
let's see.

23:38.468 --> 23:39.800
No.

23:41.771 --> 23:43.904
Someone is answering.

23:43.906 --> 23:47.575
Whatever it is
sounds like it's over it.

23:47.577 --> 23:52.646
"Do you want to talk
to us?" "No."

23:52.648 --> 23:54.482
It sounds very similar
to the male voice

23:54.484 --> 23:55.916
we've heard
throughout the house.

23:55.918 --> 23:57.251
Yeah.

23:57.253 --> 23:59.887
Irene and William are not
reaching out to us.

23:59.889 --> 24:01.972
I mean, I feel like that is
because Sue's not with us.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.058
Right.
We haven't heard anything

24:04.060 --> 24:05.726
from Eliza or the children.

24:05.728 --> 24:07.228
- Wait, I feel like...
- Wait!

24:10.066 --> 24:12.066
I heard that.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.171
- That was, like, a voice.
- Yeah.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.541
Where is that coming from?

24:27.350 --> 24:30.017
Irene and William are not
reaching out to us.

24:30.019 --> 24:31.785
I mean, I feel like that is
because Sue's not with us.

24:31.787 --> 24:32.653
Right.

24:32.655 --> 24:34.155
- Wait, I feel like...
- Wait.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.193
I heard that.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.733
- That was, like, a voice.
- Yeah!

24:45.735 --> 24:48.202
Where is that coming from?
The basement?

24:48.204 --> 24:50.371
There's something down there,
I heard it.

24:50.373 --> 24:51.672
Be careful.

24:53.876 --> 24:54.909
Did you hear that over here?

24:54.911 --> 24:57.111
I heard, like,
movement over there.

25:01.884 --> 25:03.284
Are you over here?

25:05.288 --> 25:09.290
Well, this floor is creaking.

25:09.292 --> 25:11.325
They're right here,
but I don't know if that's it.

25:14.030 --> 25:18.098
I think maybe it was coming
from, like...

25:18.100 --> 25:20.434
Over there.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.869
That's where she saw the orbs.

25:21.871 --> 25:23.404
Let's just listen to that again.

25:23.406 --> 25:25.739
Let me grab that recorder.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.377
I'm going to walk in here
for a second,

25:30.379 --> 25:32.846
'cause this is where
our friend Sue says she saw you.

25:32.848 --> 25:36.617
I'm just going to set
this recorder right here, okay?

25:36.619 --> 25:40.221
Is there someone down here
who likes to sneak away

25:40.223 --> 25:42.289
from the rest of the house?

25:44.560 --> 25:47.795
If you could talk to us
for a minute?

25:47.797 --> 25:50.231
We're trying
to get answers for Sue

25:50.233 --> 25:53.367
who's a tour guide here.

25:53.369 --> 25:55.703
Are there any children here?

26:00.843 --> 26:03.277
I know that if this
were my home,

26:03.279 --> 26:05.879
I would be really irritated
if people kept coming

26:05.881 --> 26:09.583
in and out of it constantly.

26:09.585 --> 26:11.552
Does that bother you?

26:45.388 --> 26:47.321
But we heard the...
But we heard!

26:47.323 --> 26:48.489
Like movement.

26:48.491 --> 26:50.057
Yeah, some kind
of footsteps or movement.

26:50.059 --> 26:54.094
Like it went away from us
and went over there,

26:54.096 --> 26:56.297
to, like, hide or something.

26:56.299 --> 26:57.965
I think that...

26:57.967 --> 26:59.600
Usually, if something wants
to reach out to us,

26:59.602 --> 27:01.702
by this point,
we've been here long enough

27:01.704 --> 27:05.139
for it to get familiar with us.

27:05.141 --> 27:08.575
I think that whatever is here
doesn't know us that well.

27:08.577 --> 27:11.779
And this is why I think Sue
needs to investigate with us,

27:11.781 --> 27:14.848
because, one,
we're looking for family.

27:14.850 --> 27:18.252
And, two, even what's here,
even if it's not her family,

27:18.254 --> 27:20.354
they know Sue better
than they know us.

27:20.356 --> 27:21.455
So...

27:21.457 --> 27:23.557
I honestly feel
like she is scared.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.492
If there was a way
we could, like,

27:25.494 --> 27:27.828
kind of appease
that side of her.

27:27.830 --> 27:32.566
I mean, we could bring Chip...
Bring Chip coffey

27:32.568 --> 27:35.202
and then, maybe,
we can all investigate.

27:35.204 --> 27:37.404
Together.
She can tackle those fears.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.873
She needs to, like,
connect with her family

27:39.875 --> 27:41.442
and that might open her up
a little bit more.

27:41.444 --> 27:42.976
And all those psychics tell her

27:42.978 --> 27:44.044
these people are around you,

27:44.046 --> 27:45.279
and, maybe,
he'll connect with that.

27:57.326 --> 28:00.678
Chip coffey is someone
that I trust who is a psychic,

28:00.680 --> 28:03.130
and it's a perfect fit
for this case.

28:03.132 --> 28:05.466
He was really good
at kind of honing in

28:05.468 --> 28:08.335
on people
and their family members.

28:08.337 --> 28:10.170
He can also let us know
if something's,

28:10.172 --> 28:11.638
you know, in our vicinity

28:11.640 --> 28:13.340
and give us an idea
of who is around us

28:13.342 --> 28:14.708
or who is around Sue.

28:14.710 --> 28:16.510
Sue wants to know

28:16.512 --> 28:18.545
why her grandparents are here,

28:18.547 --> 28:19.780
if they are here.

28:19.782 --> 28:23.050
Her grandparents are not
reaching out to Adam or I

28:23.052 --> 28:25.252
as we're in this house
without her,

28:25.254 --> 28:28.756
so it's imperative that Sue
investigates with us, as well.

28:32.528 --> 28:34.595
Sue has a problem
with the basement.

28:34.597 --> 28:37.030
She did have an experience
where she saw an orb,

28:37.032 --> 28:39.533
but also just the feeling
in the basement.

28:39.535 --> 28:42.970
It's really tough for her
to go into that area.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.472
Hopefully, we'll be able
to help her with that

28:45.474 --> 28:47.474
as we go through
this investigation.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.909
I just get
a creepy feeling down here,

28:48.911 --> 28:51.078
especially this end
of the basement.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.248
I'll look
at the emf levels down here.

28:56.419 --> 28:59.887
Yeah, I'm getting
0.5, 0.4 in the box area.

28:59.889 --> 29:03.557
There's absolutely something
in this back room.

29:03.559 --> 29:06.627
I've been sort of
drawn to this room

29:06.629 --> 29:10.130
and there's something
moving in there

29:10.132 --> 29:13.267
and psychically,
I'm getting distinctly male.

29:13.269 --> 29:14.935
All right.

29:14.937 --> 29:16.870
I'm going to take
the recorder in there.

29:16.872 --> 29:19.072
Is there someone in here

29:19.074 --> 29:21.408
trying to hide away from us?

29:23.779 --> 29:25.479
What's your name?

29:31.353 --> 29:33.120
Do you know Sue?

29:38.127 --> 29:42.129
Do you have a message
for someone in this room?

29:42.131 --> 29:43.664
- Play it back.
- Let's take a listen.

29:51.674 --> 29:53.640
- I thought I heard a "no."
- I heard "no."

29:58.714 --> 30:00.214
No.

30:00.216 --> 30:01.915
Like, I'm not hiding from you.

30:01.917 --> 30:04.384
- Oh, Whoa!
- What was that?

30:04.386 --> 30:05.853
<i>Is there
someone in here?</i>

30:16.131 --> 30:17.898
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

30:22.938 --> 30:24.938
What is that...
Like, "Ta, ta."

30:24.940 --> 30:25.939
I don't know.

30:28.511 --> 30:29.209
Get out?

30:50.032 --> 30:51.765
What is that...
Like, "Ta, ta."

30:52.968 --> 30:54.601
I don't know.
It's like...

30:57.740 --> 30:58.505
Get out?

31:00.009 --> 31:03.544
Something was not happy.

31:03.546 --> 31:05.012
- It's a guy.
- You see.

31:05.014 --> 31:06.146
Something negative back there.

31:06.148 --> 31:08.048
- I don't know.
- Not negative.

31:08.050 --> 31:10.817
There's nothing
truly negative here.

31:10.819 --> 31:12.419
There is grumpy or angry,

31:12.421 --> 31:13.820
but there is nothing
truly negative.

31:13.822 --> 31:17.558
You don't have anything demonic
or nasty in this place.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.625
If that's what
you're worried about,

31:18.627 --> 31:19.726
if you're worried
about something

31:19.728 --> 31:22.496
that's even
low-level demonic,

31:22.498 --> 31:23.764
it ain't here.

31:23.766 --> 31:26.533
We suspect that
it's Andrew Borden.

31:26.535 --> 31:28.602
He was a gruff man,
apparently.

31:28.604 --> 31:31.171
I would bet Andrew's
a grumpy s.O.B,

31:31.173 --> 31:34.408
like, shooing you out...
"Don't be down here,

31:34.410 --> 31:35.776
don't be down here,
don't be down here."

31:35.778 --> 31:38.412
I mean he went through
something horrific,

31:38.414 --> 31:40.981
and is made to relive
it constantly.

31:40.983 --> 31:43.617
Of course he's not happy.

31:43.619 --> 31:45.586
I will say what we have
found many times

31:45.588 --> 31:48.188
is that entities
kind of gravitate...

31:48.190 --> 31:50.290
And Chip knows this, too...
To the areas that are

31:50.292 --> 31:52.392
the least inhabited
of the house.

31:52.394 --> 31:54.461
They're trying to get
to where no one is

31:54.463 --> 31:56.396
and then you walk
into their space.

31:56.398 --> 31:58.365
That's what I mean,
I invaded their space, yeah.

31:58.367 --> 32:00.100
Exactly.

32:00.102 --> 32:01.468
- Let's go up to the attic.
- Yeah, let's go to the attic

32:01.470 --> 32:04.304
for a little bit,
and we'll hit your other area.

32:08.243 --> 32:10.811
Andrew is still
making his presence felt,

32:10.813 --> 32:14.014
but Sue's grandparents have yet
to reach out to us.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.916
We're going to the attic
because that is where

32:15.918 --> 32:19.086
Sue felt like her grandmother
tried to contact her.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.303
Maybe you should
start the evp session.

32:36.305 --> 32:37.604
Yeah.

32:40.843 --> 32:43.010
Is there somebody
up here with me?

32:46.715 --> 32:48.649
Is that you up here, Andrew?

32:55.491 --> 32:57.491
Do you want to talk to me?

33:09.338 --> 33:10.737
That's weird.

33:16.645 --> 33:18.078
I hear it say "pepe."

33:23.152 --> 33:25.852
- Here that, "pepe?"
- "Pepe."

33:25.854 --> 33:28.889
That's my grandfather.

33:28.891 --> 33:30.424
Pepe, okay.

33:30.426 --> 33:35.062
Well that's encouraging
because we got "pepe."

33:35.064 --> 33:37.431
So I think we should keep going.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.933
Pepe, was that you trying
to talk to me?

33:43.172 --> 33:45.839
Does somebody up here have
a message for me?

33:57.653 --> 33:58.685
- There you go.
- Yes.

33:58.687 --> 34:00.087
Yes.

34:00.089 --> 34:02.422
"Pepe, was that you
trying to talk to me?" "Yes."

34:11.867 --> 34:14.501
What was that...
Like, "Ta, ta."

34:17.206 --> 34:18.205
Do it one more time.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.378
I hear like, "Let go."

34:25.380 --> 34:26.713
"Let go?"

34:41.295 --> 34:43.630
What was that...
Like "Ta, ta."

34:46.635 --> 34:47.634
Do it one more time.

34:52.407 --> 34:54.608
I hear like, "Let go."

34:54.610 --> 34:57.711
"Let go?"
But why would he say that?

35:00.349 --> 35:02.315
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.851
After bringing Sue
into our investigation,

35:04.853 --> 35:07.403
her grandfather finally
reached out to us.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.973
But it's not clear
why he would say "Let go."

35:09.975 --> 35:14.294
So we're going to do a reading
<i>with</i> Chip to try to find out.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.648
Are you ready?

35:18.650 --> 35:19.649
Ready.

35:19.651 --> 35:20.700
Then let's begin.

35:24.773 --> 35:25.939
The first thing that I get,

35:25.941 --> 35:28.542
I'm getting a lot
of breathing stuff.

35:28.544 --> 35:31.845
- Who is the person with him.
- My grandfather.

35:33.916 --> 35:36.733
What did he die of?

35:36.735 --> 35:38.285
He had c.O.P.D.

35:38.287 --> 35:40.637
- Breathing.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

35:45.661 --> 35:48.929
I'm getting the word "stop"
with this person.

35:52.601 --> 35:54.601
I don't know.

35:57.339 --> 35:59.172
I'm hearing
the word "stop."

36:02.344 --> 36:03.910
I don't know.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.312
That's my question,
stop working here?

36:05.314 --> 36:06.847
Why are they here?
I don't know.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.169
There's something
about medical treatment

36:12.171 --> 36:13.954
and stopping something
that they're doing

36:13.956 --> 36:15.856
as far as medically goes.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.377
Like if somebody is getting
some sort of treatment

36:20.379 --> 36:21.645
or something is going
on medically,

36:21.647 --> 36:23.813
it's like, this needs to stop.
"Stop."

36:30.589 --> 36:32.672
I mean, my dad's on hospice.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.176
He's dying.
He has liver cancer.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.486
That's the "stop."

36:46.488 --> 36:48.121
You've got to stop
with your dad.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.789
Stop what with my dad?

36:49.791 --> 36:52.259
Holding him.

36:52.261 --> 36:53.059
Keeping him here?

36:53.061 --> 36:54.561
Mm-hmm

36:54.563 --> 36:56.229
that's what they're telling me.

36:59.268 --> 37:03.036
They're there for him.

37:03.038 --> 37:04.971
You've got to give him to them.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.216
But that's the whole message
for you tonight.

37:18.921 --> 37:23.056
You've got to let him go.

37:23.058 --> 37:26.092
And this is going to be hard
for you to hear, baby,

37:26.094 --> 37:27.294
but part of the reason

37:27.296 --> 37:29.963
that he's not beginning
that process...

37:32.467 --> 37:34.067
is he doesn't want to leave you.

37:39.741 --> 37:40.840
You know,

37:40.842 --> 37:43.076
he told me he was ready
not that long ago

37:43.078 --> 37:45.078
and I told him I understood,

37:45.080 --> 37:46.980
and that it was okay.

37:46.982 --> 37:49.015
I did.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.284
How much of that was bs?

37:51.286 --> 37:52.953
The entire amount?

37:52.955 --> 37:54.654
Probably.

37:54.656 --> 37:56.489
They're there, waiting for him.

38:00.629 --> 38:03.396
It's not like
you're losing him for good.

38:03.398 --> 38:06.566
It's just,
you're letting him go.

38:06.568 --> 38:08.868
And you're gonna be okay.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.171
You're looking at this
with your dad

38:11.173 --> 38:13.206
as the finale.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.741
'Cause it's my dad.

38:14.743 --> 38:17.677
Of course.

38:17.679 --> 38:22.082
Don't think of it
as "Good-bye,"

38:22.084 --> 38:24.084
think of it
as "See you later."

38:27.222 --> 38:28.121
Okay?

38:28.123 --> 38:29.622
Thank you.

38:29.624 --> 38:31.491
Come to me.

38:31.493 --> 38:33.159
Thank you so much.

38:36.999 --> 38:38.331
Let it go.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.808
How are you feeling right now

38:48.810 --> 38:55.081
about this whole experience?

38:55.083 --> 38:56.316
I'm surprised

38:56.318 --> 38:58.618
and I'm, uh...

38:58.620 --> 39:00.186
A little sad,

39:00.188 --> 39:02.689
but I understand.

39:02.691 --> 39:05.158
And so now you know
why your grandparents

39:05.160 --> 39:06.292
are here with you.

39:06.294 --> 39:07.927
And I think it does make sense

39:07.929 --> 39:09.996
that maybe your family would
kind of step in here and there

39:09.998 --> 39:12.999
and defend you in a way,
but it's not really, like,

39:13.001 --> 39:15.869
a spiritual battle, per se.

39:15.871 --> 39:17.904
Yeah, okay.

39:17.906 --> 39:19.706
I think they're
just here with you.

39:19.708 --> 39:23.510
You are at a place that's known

39:23.512 --> 39:25.945
for dealing
with paranormal topics.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.580
And what better place for them
to hang out with you?

39:27.582 --> 39:30.617
And I mean they love you,
and so they're hanging with you.

39:30.619 --> 39:34.938
I think protecting probably
is a strong word.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.690
I don't feel evil lurking
around the corners

39:37.692 --> 39:39.926
in this house, do you?

39:39.928 --> 39:42.011
Maybe sometimes, yeah.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.880
Like down that basement
especially.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.515
If you're scared,

39:45.517 --> 39:47.100
they're going to feed
on your fear, too.

39:47.102 --> 39:49.702
Anything negative is going
to feed on your fear.

39:49.704 --> 39:51.271
I know you have that experience.

39:51.273 --> 39:53.706
If we can go back
and kind of tackle that

39:53.708 --> 39:55.692
with you again in the space,

39:55.694 --> 39:57.193
and just, you know,

39:57.195 --> 39:58.428
reiterate that
there's nothing here

39:58.430 --> 40:01.915
that's going to attack
you and hurt you.

40:01.917 --> 40:03.783
We'll work on it tonight,
for sure,

40:03.785 --> 40:05.018
'cause you shouldn't be scared.

40:06.855 --> 40:09.089
We now know
why Sue's grandparents

40:09.091 --> 40:10.423
are in the house with her,

40:10.425 --> 40:13.193
but she's still a little
apprehensive about Andrew.

40:13.195 --> 40:14.961
So we're going to head
into the basement

40:14.963 --> 40:17.664
so that she can finally
stand up for herself.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.065
And we're going to
help her do it.

40:19.067 --> 40:23.036
So take this opportunity
and tell him how you feel.

40:23.038 --> 40:25.472
Like, address the problem now.

40:25.474 --> 40:27.006
Sue: I'm not going
to be afraid of you anymore

40:27.008 --> 40:30.743
and you're not going to stop me
from doing my job in the house.

40:30.745 --> 40:34.214
I want to take back
the control of my space,

40:34.216 --> 40:35.348
and set up my boundaries

40:35.350 --> 40:38.852
and you're not allowed
to mess with me.

40:38.854 --> 40:41.020
Do you mean that?

40:41.022 --> 40:42.489
Yeah, I mean that.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.426
Obviously,
I feel just terribly

40:46.428 --> 40:47.660
for Sue with her family

40:47.662 --> 40:50.447
and what they're all going
through with her father.

40:53.852 --> 40:57.787
But I think that now
she has confirmation of things

40:57.789 --> 40:59.322
that she's experienced,

40:59.324 --> 41:03.993
and she's got the know-how
of how to handle this situation.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.962
I think if Sue wants
to work in the house,

41:05.964 --> 41:08.831
she should continue
working in this house.

41:08.833 --> 41:12.185
Tonight she got a little
stronger in her own beliefs.

41:12.187 --> 41:14.654
I think we got Sue information
that she needed,

41:14.656 --> 41:17.490
and I think she was happy.
