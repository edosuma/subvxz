01:28.160 --> 01:30.390
All right, Griff, get your horse
back in the gate.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.793
ls my fly open again?

01:34.280 --> 01:37.829
l'm talking about your shoe horse,
you big Airedale.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.311
The blubber-aerobics class next door
is getting ready to start...

01:41.520 --> 01:43.351
-...in a couple of seconds.
-All right.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.556
So, what we got riding on this one,
big Al?

01:45.800 --> 01:49.110
Loser gets to use the bathroom last.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.789
Stinky seconds?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.351
You bet.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.037
Let's rock.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.191
Three, two, one...

02:06.760 --> 02:09.592
-...and they're off.
-Come on, Seattle Shoe.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.677
-Go, Knockout, go.
-Come on, Seattle Shoe.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.110
-Come on, Knockout.
-Come on, Seattle Shoe.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.357
-Yeah. Come on.
-Papa needs a new pair--

02:17.880 --> 02:20.314
-What happened?
-Well, the hungry hippos over there...

02:20.520 --> 02:23.193
...worked out
for a whole seven seconds.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.759
lt's probably time for a cheese break.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.355
How are we gonna settle
this race now?

02:29.600 --> 02:31.431
l got an idea.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.909
Free jerk chicken
at the food court, man.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.436
l won! l won!

02:45.680 --> 02:47.557
l win.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.837
l won the Shoetucky Derby.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.071
But l was ahead.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.719
Did you cheat?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.793
ls this the face of a cheater?

03:01.760 --> 03:04.957
Am l gonna have to check
that surveillance camera again?

03:05.320 --> 03:08.790
All right. l cheated.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.315
And l ate your lunch.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.836
Drank your vanilla shake.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.913
Al, that was Kaopectate.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.151
Still the best lunch l've had in years.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.392
Oh, will you look at those karate cows
hoofing it over to self-defence class?

03:27.640 --> 03:31.633
Or, as they call it,
tae kwon doughnut.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.430
Can you believe Gary's charging
250 bucks for that class?

03:36.680 --> 03:39.240
lt's still less than a dollar a pound.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.035
What a stupid waste of money.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.396
Hey, speaking of waste of money.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.196
Al, l need $250.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.315
You're not taking
that self-defence class, are you?

03:59.960 --> 04:04.431
No. l'm buying you
a very special gift.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.554
Of course l'm taking
the self-defence class.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.154
Marcie already signed me up.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.714
Peg, l'm not wasting my money
like l wasted my youth, on you.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.918
Self-defence is not a waste of money.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.718
We live in a bad neighbourhood.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.474
Peg, you live on the couch.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.833
The only danger you face...

04:27.040 --> 04:29.952
...is getting your head stuck
in a Haagen-Dazs carton.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.678
Peg, let's face it, evolution
has only equipped you women...

04:33.880 --> 04:36.713
...made you strong enough,
to roll out of bed in the morning...

04:36.920 --> 04:39.593
...squeeze yourself into a girdle,
ooze down the stairs...

04:39.800 --> 04:42.234
...and fry your man up a Pop-Tart.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.473
Peg, the truth is
no woman could ever take a man.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.314
You'd back me up on that,
wouldn't you, Hans?

04:50.560 --> 04:51.993
You see, Peg...

04:52.240 --> 04:53.992
...we men are bigger...

04:54.240 --> 04:56.834
...we're stronger, we're tougher...

04:57.080 --> 04:58.593
...we're--

05:00.520 --> 05:02.590
Dead meat.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.676
Al, guess what?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.878
You got your black belt in nag fu.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.556
Marcie and l have been promoted
to the advanced self-defence class.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.472
Aren't you happy for me?

05:22.720 --> 05:25.029
Do l look like a happy man?

05:25.600 --> 05:28.319
You don't even look like
a happy tree stump.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.754
l'm gonna go outside
and practice my kicks with Marcie.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.197
Look, this self-defence class
of yours is taking up way too much...

05:35.440 --> 05:37.476
...of your time and my paycheque.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.439
l haven't been able to find my left shoe
in three days.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.992
Now, as the breadwinner
and king of my castle, l demand--

05:46.440 --> 05:48.795
To be left alone.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.918
Good. Where's the shoe?

06:09.160 --> 06:13.073
Dad, if you're looking for a place
to stick your head, l suggest the oven.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.548
l'm looking for my shoe.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.793
lt's a good thing we have Lucky.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.877
-Maybe he can track it down for you.
-Yeah.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.036
Let me get this old shoe
out of his mouth...

06:23.240 --> 06:24.719
...and he'll be ready for action.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.235
Oh, pumpkin, that's my shoe.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.757
Oh, Lucky, you found it right away.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.116
Good boy.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.310
Now we know he can chew.
Maybe next time he'll go for my throat.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.513
Oh, no, thanks. I don't eat pork.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.512
Dad, you look sad. What is it?

06:45.760 --> 06:48.069
-lt's your mother.
-What'd she do?

06:48.320 --> 06:52.199
Well, the trouble started this morning
when l woke up...

06:52.440 --> 06:55.398
...and so did she.
You know how much l hate that.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.756
l think l know what it is, Daddy.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.519
You're just feeling lonely...

07:03.720 --> 07:06.154
...because ever since Mom
started taking her class...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.112
...she hasn't paid you any attention.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.471
lsn't that it, you big galoot?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.470
No, l like that part. l also like the part
she's too tired at night...

07:16.680 --> 07:18.557
...to wanna fool around.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.391
l do kind of miss her
calling me bullet head, though.

07:23.800 --> 07:29.432
Look, Daddy, a little lesson in women:
All Mom wants is just a little tenderness.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.954
lf you really want Mom to stop
taking karate, you gotta take her out.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.670
Well, don't you think l would
if l thought l could get away with it?

07:43.360 --> 07:46.158
Dad, l think she means, you know,
take her out on a date...

07:46.400 --> 07:48.516
-Yeah.
-...and show her some affection.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.271
Romantic movies
always work for me.

07:52.520 --> 07:56.308
A Happy Meal and a Hello Kitty pen set
works for you, Kelly.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.955
Look, why don't you take Mom to go
see The Bridges Of Madison County.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.237
Now, l heard there's a new director's cut
with 1 1 extra minutes...

08:09.440 --> 08:12.750
...of Clint Eastwood
sponge-bathing Meryl Streep.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.874
ls there no other way?

08:18.800 --> 08:22.156
Well, you could make love to her
all night.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.359
Well, either way, l'll be eating
Junior Mints and crying in the dark.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.312
All right.
Bridges of Madison County it is.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.948
Oh, that was so much fun.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.596
Thanks for being
such a good sport, Jefferson.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.831
No problem.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.952
You know, just between you and me...

08:54.160 --> 08:57.391
...these workouts
are starting to turn me on.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.793
-So, what do you say?
-l say l need a flashlight.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.312
l think some of my equipment
rolled under the house.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.670
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

09:16.320 --> 09:20.359
...reporting to you live at the premiere
of The Bridges of Madison County...

09:20.600 --> 09:22.272
... The Director's Cut.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.034
As you can see,
the re-release of this movie...

09:25.280 --> 09:27.669
...has generated
unbelievable excitement.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.673
l'm unbelievably excited, you know....

09:50.080 --> 09:52.799
Oh, Al, isn't this romantic?

09:53.040 --> 09:56.430
Finally you're taking me to a movie
that doesn't have the words '' Debbie'' ...

09:56.640 --> 09:58.915
...or ''does'' in the title.

10:00.160 --> 10:04.358
l just can't figure out why you insisted
on taking me the night of my class.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.717
Pookie, tomorrow l may not be
in the mood to see Meryl and Clint...

10:07.960 --> 10:10.599
...playing Hide the Loofa
in the bathtub.

10:10.840 --> 10:15.391
Oh, my God, l'm in line to watch
Meryl Streep strip.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.479
No bloody way.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.472
Yeah, sure, go ahead,
take the easy way out.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.360
l just hope
l don't fall behind in class.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.478
Today was nunchak-to-the-nads day.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.319
Don't you understand, Peg?

10:36.520 --> 10:39.080
This women's self-defence
is against nature.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.754
Take the mighty wildebeest,
for example.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.669
He hunts while the wildebeestess
just stays on her couch...

10:45.920 --> 10:48.593
...watching the Oprah-beestess.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.717
Then there's the ant. She just
sits there all day and lays eggs...

10:52.920 --> 10:56.071
...while the male is off dragging
those heavy Budweiser bottles...

10:56.280 --> 10:57.508
...down that anthill.

10:57.760 --> 11:01.230
-l'll give you another example--
-Hey.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.676
This is the bravest thing
this reporter has seen...

11:13.880 --> 11:17.350
...since Bill said,
'' Hillary, l beg to differ.''

11:17.600 --> 11:21.878
This courageous woman
cold-cocked this low-life mugger...

11:22.080 --> 11:23.911
...without any help whatsoever...

11:24.120 --> 11:29.194
...from the weasely man
who dares to call himself her husband.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.632
Well, you got to admit, it's pithy.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.917
Jefferson, don't you understand
the problem?

11:50.280 --> 11:54.319
lf this gets around town, people
are gonna start thinking l'm a nerd.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.319
Well, technically, Al,
you're not smart enough to be a nerd.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.634
No, no, you're more of a pantywaist...

12:02.840 --> 12:05.991
...or a limp-wristed sissy boy.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.671
Horse feathers, Jefferson.
l could have taken that mugger. l just--

12:12.920 --> 12:14.319
l didn't have time to react.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.272
Hey, l believe you, buddy.
lt's the rest of Chicago...

12:18.520 --> 12:21.432
...that thinks Al is short for Alice.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.151
You gotta understand, when l felt
that hairy hand go in my pocket...

12:26.360 --> 12:28.510
...l naturally assumed it was Peg.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.476
Don't worry, Al.
lt was just a little mugging.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.075
l mean, how much more press
could it possibly get?

12:35.720 --> 12:38.234
Great news, Al.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.357
Good Morning, Chicago
wants to do an interview.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.592
Fine. l'd like to set the record straight.
l am no wimp.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.435
Could a wimp score four touchdowns
in one game?

12:54.680 --> 12:57.797
Was that Pee Wee football
or Powderpuff?

12:58.320 --> 13:01.039
l'm sorry.
We're here to interview your wife.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.589
Would you be a doll
and brew us up some coffee?

13:03.840 --> 13:06.832
And feel free to make
some herbal tea for yourself.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.438
All right. Come on, Al.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.877
Hey. Hey, l think l know
how to put an end to all of this.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.235
Well, if you've got the tailpipe,
l've got the lips.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.990
Let's assume for the sake of argument
that you are stronger than Peggy.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.595
l am stronger, damn it!

13:26.840 --> 13:30.799
Well, you know that
and l'm willing to play along.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.430
-But you have to prove it to the public.
-You want me to fight Peg on TV?

13:34.640 --> 13:36.278
-Love it.
-No.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.355
No. No. You gotta fight someone else.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.158
But can l still fight Peg?

13:41.400 --> 13:45.518
No, Al. Look, we have to stage a fight
even you can win.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.198
Okay. Look.
l have this stuntman friend.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.352
His name is Thunder, okay?
You go to this bar, he comes up.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.398
-He insults Peggy.
-And l buy him a drink?

13:59.240 --> 14:02.949
Later. First, you hit him with your
best shot. He pretends to be hurt.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.590
He falls down. You're out
of the Michael Bolton fan club.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.918
That's a good idea.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.549
That's a good idea.
And l can have Bud come in...

14:15.760 --> 14:17.159
-...and video the thing.
-Yeah.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.998
Then l'll fight Peg.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.834
That will work, but how can l
recognise your buddy?

14:23.080 --> 14:28.029
Oh, well, Thunder has a goatee,
wears a bandana...

14:28.280 --> 14:32.034
...and he reeks of that cologne,
Obsession for Men.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.038
Excuse me.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.358
You may go.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.356
Al, l thought you were taking me out
for a nice, romantic dinner.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.591
We are, Peg. l just wanna...

15:11.840 --> 15:14.673
...soak up the atmosphere here.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.109
Obsession for Men?

15:21.360 --> 15:25.911
Well, l experimented a little in college,
but it was just a phase.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.276
Honey, l wanna go freshen up.
You think the ladies' room is free?

15:48.920 --> 15:50.831
lt's free.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.153
Dad, can we get this thing over with?

15:56.400 --> 15:59.915
lt's kind of sleazy in here and,
frankly, it's a little scary.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.230
l don't wanna be in here
any more than you do.

16:02.440 --> 16:06.115
What kind of low-life loser would
voluntarily come in a dump like this?

16:12.280 --> 16:16.239
Oh, this isn't the library.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.479
We must be in the wrong place,
study buddy.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.230
l thought we were gonna get hammered
and do it on the '' Pac-Man.''

16:25.200 --> 16:27.634
But that book must be checked out.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.235
Why don't we go to the other library
down the street?

16:30.480 --> 16:32.550
The one with the Jell-O shots? Cool.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.514
Well, she's moving on up.
She used to only date senators.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.756
Bud, here comes your mother.
Go hide.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.558
How am l gonna know when to start?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.998
When l say to this guy, Thunder,
'' l'll tell you what l'm gonna do.''

16:49.840 --> 16:52.718
Hey, Al, how come on the wall
next to the pay phone...

16:52.960 --> 16:56.270
...it says, for a good time,
call our house?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.954
Beats me. l never
had a good time there.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.671
What will you have?

17:04.440 --> 17:09.513
Did you call my wife an ugly, useless,
lazy, Oprah-watching...

17:09.760 --> 17:12.433
...bonbon-eating couch loafer?

17:12.680 --> 17:14.750
No, l said, ''What will you have?''

17:15.200 --> 17:18.157
One of your finest beers.
Nothing for the wife.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.234
You're cute.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.038
Wanna ride a hog?

17:30.000 --> 17:34.676
-Well, all right, then.
-No, no, no. Mommy, daddy!

17:38.760 --> 17:41.149
Al, what are you doing?

17:41.400 --> 17:44.915
You take me out at night
and sniff other men?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.557
l'm not sniffing them, Peg.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.918
lt's a male thing.
Shows dominance in the territory.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.470
Well, you're not gonna lift
your leg on a chair, are you?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.910
l'm Thunder. Sorry l'm late.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.513
Your wife.

18:08.760 --> 18:13.880
Your wife's a tacky,
chocolate-snarfing, couch-butted...

18:14.120 --> 18:17.476
...beehive-headed parasite.

18:23.240 --> 18:28.030
No one calls my wife a tacky,
chocolate-snarfing, couch-butted...

18:28.280 --> 18:34.037
...beehive-headed parasite
who snores louder than a logging mill.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.674
Al, he didn't say that.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.480
No, but he was gonna say it
if l hadn't stopped him.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.599
-So, what are you gonna do about it?
-What am l gonna do about it?

18:45.840 --> 18:48.115
l'll tell you
what l'm gonna do about it.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.393
Oh, no, please don't.
You're hurting me!

18:56.440 --> 18:59.910
l said, l'll tell you
what l'm gonna do about it, Bud!

19:05.680 --> 19:07.796
-Okay, Dad.
-Now...

19:08.560 --> 19:11.472
...would you mind repeating
what you just said to my wife.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.153
Well, l forgot.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.075
-A chocolate-snarfing--
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.551
A couch-butted,
beehive-headed parasite.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.313
All right?

19:23.840 --> 19:26.274
You asked for this, pal.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.312
One...

19:28.880 --> 19:30.199
...two--

19:30.440 --> 19:32.158
Three.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.233
l got it. Good night.

19:53.120 --> 19:57.193
You ever think about
just getting a perm?

19:58.280 --> 20:01.477
And selling Mary Kay cosmetics?

20:10.720 --> 20:13.234
They give you a pink car.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.597
Tell me, Mrs. Bundy, has your husband
always been more Lois than Clark?

20:24.680 --> 20:28.229
Now, look here, Miranda.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.151
lf you really want some film at 1 1 ...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.550
...why don't you follow me
down to the brewery.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.911
l'll tie a bowling ball to my ankle,
dive in a vat of beer.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.790
l'll leave this world the same way
l entered my marriage, dead drunk.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.032
Hey, l thought you said l could have
your bowling ball when you die.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.754
-Don't you push it, Jefferson.
-Hey, come on.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.549
-Daddy?
-You wanna kick me while l'm down?

21:01.920 --> 21:04.434
No, that's Mom's job.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.873
Now, you remember Genghis
from the library, right?

21:10.400 --> 21:13.517
Okay, go ahead Gengie.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.311
Mr. Bundy...

21:18.480 --> 21:23.554
...would you give me your hand
in daughter marriage?

21:29.600 --> 21:33.639
You know, Genghis,
your timing couldn't be better.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.279
You wanna do me a favour, son?

21:39.800 --> 21:43.315
You wanna say what you just said to me
in front of the camera here?

21:43.560 --> 21:45.073
Sure, Dad.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.073
Hey, and better still,
hold my wallet.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.799
Cool.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.800
-Call my wife an idiot.
-Okay.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.793
Mrs. Bundy...

21:56.000 --> 21:57.831
...you're an idiot.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.592
That's good.
