00:07.070 --> 00:09.372
My Dad started to work in
the cartel when he was 14.

00:09.396 --> 00:11.701
Drop the magazine. Empty the chamber.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.153
Reload.

00:15.425 --> 00:17.186
I know he wouldn't want this for you.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.344
I've been lucky every day
since I've had it.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.380
Thank you.

00:24.050 --> 00:27.208
It's too dangerous for you... for him.

00:32.892 --> 00:36.257
We're selling to Dumas now.
Javier will be your contact.

00:36.281 --> 00:38.145
You and I won't be meeting again.

00:38.169 --> 00:40.933
It must've been Dumas
who told the judge about us.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.261
- Whoa, slow down.
- You broke our trust.

00:43.285 --> 00:44.845
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:44.869 --> 00:46.164
Where is Bobby?

00:50.876 --> 00:54.413
Soon as she pops her head up, we hit her.

01:02.255 --> 01:03.561
Your Honor.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.307
Word is, Mendoza's sending you a message.

01:08.978 --> 01:10.311
To put that girl in her place.

01:11.122 --> 01:13.909
Get off of me!

01:13.933 --> 01:17.246
This is for Dumas.

01:17.270 --> 01:19.938
After that, we go back
to business as usual.

02:18.377 --> 02:21.500
Dumas went after her
'cause she was an easy target.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.002
He'll try to kill anyone tied to us.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.673
I need to see Tony.

02:29.799 --> 02:31.058
Where's Javier?

02:54.768 --> 02:56.083
Where were you?

02:58.288 --> 02:59.564
We're at war, - Hey...

02:59.588 --> 03:01.108
And you disappear to screw some bitch?

03:01.132 --> 03:02.993
Hey, cabrón. Watch your mouth, puto.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.956
Or what, cabrón?

03:04.980 --> 03:06.177
What?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.262
Pote.

03:10.298 --> 03:11.659
Give us a minute.

03:28.347 --> 03:31.315
- Who is she?
- Her name is Emilia.

03:36.369 --> 03:38.081
You didn't answer my question.

03:45.169 --> 03:47.087
She's Boaz's ex-fiancée.

03:50.174 --> 03:52.558
And she's with you now.

04:01.057 --> 04:03.293
He can't know she's here.

04:03.768 --> 04:05.677
My cousin's been with
a lot of women, pero...

04:12.455 --> 04:14.055
I'm sorry, patrona. I'm sorry, Teresa.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.793
I... I didn't want
to make this your problem.

04:16.817 --> 04:18.575
This isn't our only problem.

04:20.368 --> 04:22.729
Dumas killed Birdie.

04:26.082 --> 04:28.126
This hijo de puta!

04:28.393 --> 04:30.036
I need you to do something.

04:33.214 --> 04:34.780
Whatever you need.

04:35.049 --> 04:36.949
Do we need to put someone to protect her?

04:36.951 --> 04:40.054
No, no one else knows, and...

04:40.738 --> 04:42.599
I want to keep it that way.

04:44.408 --> 04:45.683
Let's go.

05:03.432 --> 05:04.815
Hey.

05:10.434 --> 05:12.961
Tony will be out in a jiffy.

05:14.713 --> 05:16.750
Um, hey,

05:16.774 --> 05:19.776
I-I'm so sorry about
what happened to your bartender.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.803
Birdie, right?

05:23.306 --> 05:24.472
Thank you.

05:26.017 --> 05:28.643
Teresa, I heard someone came after you.

05:29.645 --> 05:30.954
It's okay.

05:31.272 --> 05:33.339
I wanna talk to you.

05:33.341 --> 05:34.649
Come outside.

05:35.278 --> 05:36.319
Okay.

05:40.263 --> 05:41.699
Listen.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.161
I know you've gone through a lot,

05:45.519 --> 05:47.019
but you can't just disappear

05:47.021 --> 05:49.081
without letting anyone
know where you are,

05:53.378 --> 05:55.478
Look, I wanna pull my own weight.

05:55.953 --> 05:57.186
You can use me.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.431
Do it.

06:05.455 --> 06:08.040
I promised your mother I'd keep you safe.

06:10.044 --> 06:12.829
My father was a soldier,
and this is who I am.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.444
You have no idea
what this life really is.

06:18.468 --> 06:19.779
It is not for you.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.984
You taught me to shoot a gun
for a reason.

06:28.144 --> 06:30.790
What your father had to do,

06:30.814 --> 06:33.584
what everyone in this life
is forced to do... look at me...

06:39.073 --> 06:41.968
You can never come back from.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.033
Whoever you thought you were...

06:50.608 --> 06:52.156
that dies.

06:55.923 --> 06:58.651
You don't want this.

08:16.813 --> 08:20.399
Gonna need you to step
outside the vehicle, please.

08:20.423 --> 08:23.269
Just... you.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.465
Find your center of peace and not move.

08:32.352 --> 08:33.788
Teresa?

08:34.746 --> 08:36.414
It's okay.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.366
Go.

09:09.031 --> 09:11.640
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

09:14.144 --> 09:16.622
Shame about that young girl.

09:17.313 --> 09:20.683
I understand the rage you may be feeling,

09:20.685 --> 09:23.702
but you and Marcel have each lost one.

09:23.712 --> 09:25.714
Scales are balanced now.

09:25.738 --> 09:28.691
I need you to pin your anger to the post.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.636
His men tried to kill me.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.973
After Marcel's men turned up dead.

09:34.497 --> 09:36.725
You drew first blood.

09:36.749 --> 09:41.037
Had you given me an answer
to our proposed partnership,

09:41.039 --> 09:42.921
my tone might be more amenable.

09:42.923 --> 09:45.067
You don't care about the deaths,

09:45.758 --> 09:47.319
just about money.

09:47.343 --> 09:50.262
And a good working relationship.

09:50.264 --> 09:53.993
Marcel and I have
peacefully coexisted for years.

09:54.017 --> 09:57.102
There's been nothing but chaos
since you arrived.

09:57.104 --> 09:59.855
That chaos wasn't started by me.

10:01.858 --> 10:04.443
Dumas is making this personal.

10:04.445 --> 10:07.048
I'll speak to Marcel.

10:07.864 --> 10:10.566
But you need to be the bigger man here...

10:10.568 --> 10:12.618
cool those pretty heels

10:13.137 --> 10:15.037
till we figure this thing out.

10:17.475 --> 10:19.909
Let me know you've heard me,

10:19.911 --> 10:22.021
and that you understand...

10:23.213 --> 10:24.914
With words.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.137
I heard you.

10:32.139 --> 10:34.033
Good girl.

10:53.743 --> 10:54.807
It's done.

10:56.973 --> 10:58.614
They'll know who you are now.

11:07.173 --> 11:09.625
Where are we on surveillance?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.794
We have eyes on some targets.

11:12.113 --> 11:13.679
We'll have more soon.

11:13.681 --> 11:16.742
His club, his house, his people.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.268
- We have a line on his family.
- No.

11:22.456 --> 11:24.117
We're at war.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.627
Not his family.

11:31.673 --> 11:34.032
I'm gonna go fortify our defense.

11:39.056 --> 11:42.767
Patrona, are you okay?

11:45.521 --> 11:47.773
I want you to take me somewhere.

12:07.543 --> 12:10.519
Welcome to the Casa De Santos.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.882
Thank you for seeing me
such a short notice, madrina.

12:13.906 --> 12:15.926
This... this is her.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.389
You seek a blessing of protection?

12:22.832 --> 12:26.035
She's a leader
looking out for her people.

12:30.173 --> 12:32.234
You are afraid she will fail.

12:33.593 --> 12:36.655
The Orishas will guide us. Let us begin.

14:15.611 --> 14:17.339
Will this be enough to protect her?

14:17.363 --> 14:20.426
The Santos tell me this is not
what your friend seeks.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.212
It is a reckoning.

14:42.247 --> 14:44.247
I'd love to thank to that...

14:44.759 --> 14:47.008
hurricane you came in with was...

14:47.535 --> 14:50.414
all about my undeniable sex appeal.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.584
Unfortunately, for my ego, I know better.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.489
Just work.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.910
I'm listening.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.249
I want to run my business
in a way, and...

15:13.604 --> 15:16.607
The competition is forcing me to change.

15:18.766 --> 15:21.403
And you have to make compromises.

15:23.513 --> 15:25.191
And if you don't,

15:25.616 --> 15:27.493
they try to take you down.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.620
Most people give in...

15:30.621 --> 15:33.958
"if you can't beat 'em,
join 'em" mentality.

15:34.857 --> 15:37.359
Something tells me you can beat them.

15:39.229 --> 15:42.466
If the train is taking you
to somewhere you don't wanna go,

15:43.401 --> 15:45.469
to someone you don't wanna be,

15:46.887 --> 15:48.472
get off the train.

15:50.932 --> 15:52.518
Thank you.

15:53.794 --> 15:56.795
I'm also available for
all the stuff we just did...

15:57.189 --> 15:59.316
if you need help working that out again.

16:08.475 --> 16:10.259
You don't have to do this, Marcel.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.094
We can handle this bitch on our own.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.407
You're gonna wanna stop talking.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.265
Right now.

16:37.271 --> 16:39.356
Shomari James.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.734
Marcel.

16:43.010 --> 16:45.938
I knew I was getting them A-T-L boys.

16:45.962 --> 16:47.796
I didn't know I was getting the boss.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.326
We go back, man.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.184
And you got beef this hot,

16:53.186 --> 16:55.289
I'm here to put a period on that shit.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.474
So how you want this to go down?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.502
Scorched earth.

17:01.361 --> 17:04.339
Her people, her spots...

17:05.198 --> 17:07.531
Mari, she don't see the sun rise.

17:09.285 --> 17:11.130
Say less.

17:26.385 --> 17:28.362
All right.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.651
Now you know my secret.

17:46.694 --> 17:48.801
Are you in love with her?

17:56.141 --> 17:58.367
We didn't plan for it to happen.

18:03.873 --> 18:05.423
My cousin killed his own brother

18:05.425 --> 18:07.111
like it was nothing,

18:08.095 --> 18:10.154
just to seize power.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.934
Imagine what he would do
if he knew about Emilia.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.889
Boaz is my associate,

18:20.891 --> 18:22.583
but you're with me now.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.012
I don't know how to thank you, patrona.

18:39.450 --> 18:42.059
Put a man on my friend for protection.

18:43.939 --> 18:45.964
He can't know.

18:48.217 --> 18:50.362
Are we crazy?

18:51.087 --> 18:53.364
To want something different in this life?

18:57.702 --> 18:59.595
I don't know.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.182
They almost got me. It was Dumas' men.

20:27.184 --> 20:30.068
He brought them from outside.
I saw Georgia plates.

20:30.070 --> 20:31.546
So, he's hired more men.

20:43.366 --> 20:46.061
- Hello?
- Patrona, we have a problem.

20:49.013 --> 20:50.755
The Judge is coming for us.

20:50.757 --> 20:53.375
It's punishment for not backing down.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.261
He's clearing the way
for Dumas to finish us.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.077
It's past my office hours,

21:02.101 --> 21:03.863
and I got a bourbon
waiting for me at home.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.437
I need my men released.

21:06.439 --> 21:07.723
That's gonna be tricky

21:07.725 --> 21:10.703
given their questionable
immigration status...

21:11.170 --> 21:14.563
not to mention the unregistered
firearms found on their persons.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.884
How much is it going to cost?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.378
You've already heard my terms.

21:19.402 --> 21:21.814
10% is too much.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.387
I've spent some time in your country.

21:28.411 --> 21:31.557
I know your people like to haggle,

21:31.581 --> 21:35.383
but this isn't some Tia-Juana
flea market, Miss Mendoza.

21:36.444 --> 21:38.780
My price is final.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.923
Now, you can pay it,

21:40.925 --> 21:43.736
or you can go back home
and haggle with tourists

21:43.760 --> 21:46.705
over $5 souvenirs.

21:46.729 --> 21:48.597
Your choice.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.101
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Okay.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.652
10%.

21:59.108 --> 22:01.303
Wise decision.

22:01.911 --> 22:04.829
You'll see how much smoother
things go for you

22:04.831 --> 22:06.892
moving forward, Miss Mendoza.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.159
I made a deal.

22:24.183 --> 22:25.660
It will get our men released

22:25.684 --> 22:27.469
and put a stop to Dumas' attacks.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.281
But they won't come out tonight,

22:29.305 --> 22:31.522
and Dumas' men are still coming for us.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.961
Let's go inside.
We're sitting ducks out here.

22:35.003 --> 22:37.456
And we know where Dumas' men hang out.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.424
Maybe we should grab Cedric.

22:39.448 --> 22:43.427
Good insurance... just in case the
Judge doesn't work fast enough.

22:45.871 --> 22:48.824
You don't make a truce out of weakness.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.826
You make it out of strength.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.294
It's a smart move, Teresita.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.475
Javier,

22:56.499 --> 22:59.334
don't let this end like Bobby.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.552
I want him alive.

23:38.983 --> 23:40.185
No, not that.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.932
Hey.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.434
I gotta hustle, man.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.756
Marcel's gonna be looking for me.

24:40.758 --> 24:42.198
You even think of holding out on me,

24:42.222 --> 24:44.655
I'll send your ass back
upstate... finish your bid.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.217
Wait, what?

24:46.241 --> 24:47.881
I already gave you
her coke business, man.

24:47.883 --> 24:50.243
I gave you her deal with Marcel.
Now, what else do you want?

24:50.267 --> 24:52.114
What else do I want?

24:52.116 --> 24:53.725
I want details!

24:53.749 --> 24:55.117
There's a war now.

24:55.484 --> 24:57.585
I know Marcel's got people in play.

25:06.487 --> 25:08.630
Who taught you to do that?

25:08.632 --> 25:12.577
It's for protection.

25:12.601 --> 25:14.469
When I was a young boy,

25:14.471 --> 25:16.972
mi tía Pilar,
would drag me to la Botánica.

25:17.457 --> 25:20.024
She told me that Santería was created

25:20.026 --> 25:22.360
when the slave-masters
would force their slaves

25:22.362 --> 25:24.255
to practice Christianity.

25:24.279 --> 25:26.197
So the slaves banded together

25:26.199 --> 25:28.961
and created their own secret religion

25:28.985 --> 25:31.179
so they can keep their own faith.

25:31.989 --> 25:35.134
Mi tía survived life in Culiacán.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.159
She survived cancer.

25:37.161 --> 25:41.496
Dumas' men fired at me
at point-blank range.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.608
A bullet went right through my jacket

25:43.632 --> 25:45.693
and didn't even touch me.

25:45.717 --> 25:48.864
The Orishas protected
mi tía and me, and now,

25:49.338 --> 25:51.506
they will protect us.

25:53.284 --> 25:55.829
I thought we would be safe here.

25:57.063 --> 26:00.083
Building this business with decency

26:00.516 --> 26:02.544
has never been done.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.964
They see a soft heart,

26:06.573 --> 26:08.675
and they think weakness.

26:09.242 --> 26:11.576
Do you think it's weakness?

26:11.578 --> 26:14.264
I think it's courage.

26:14.997 --> 26:18.510
But I also know that
you will have to change

26:18.534 --> 26:21.703
to become the person
that you're supposed to be.

26:24.982 --> 26:27.592
What if that person scares me?

26:40.106 --> 26:41.666
Pinche Judge double-crossed us.

26:41.690 --> 26:42.940
Safe room. Go.

26:42.942 --> 26:44.669
Blast anything that
comes through that door.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.536
Pote.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.960
Those are the guys who came after me.

27:02.962 --> 27:05.580
The Judge's 10% has paid off.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.298
Don't move.

27:09.384 --> 27:12.231
- Keep it right there.
- 'K, we got them.

27:23.149 --> 27:24.650
Yes?

27:26.568 --> 27:28.713
The Judge's crooked cop.

27:29.656 --> 27:31.750
Gave him intel on Dumas and you.

27:31.774 --> 27:34.719
So it was Cedric who
ratted us out to the Judge,

27:34.743 --> 27:36.304
not Dumas?

27:36.328 --> 27:39.055
I've got Cedric in my sights.

27:52.716 --> 27:56.298
- I want to talk to you.
- I ain't got nothing to say to you.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.133
Then you can listen.

28:15.289 --> 28:16.850
Okay.

28:17.286 --> 28:19.847
O'Keefe and Common.

28:25.961 --> 28:28.830
I need you to deliver a message to Dumas.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.275
I want a truce.

28:30.299 --> 28:31.943
You killed his people.

28:31.967 --> 28:33.945
And he killed mine.

28:34.803 --> 28:36.614
This war isn't good for any of us.

28:36.638 --> 28:39.115
You need me alive
to deliver that message.

28:47.164 --> 28:48.855
Make sure he gets it.

29:19.931 --> 29:21.710
You got my message?

29:21.734 --> 29:23.934
Yeah, I did. You sic the Judge's dogs

29:23.936 --> 29:25.913
on my guys and you think I'm done?

29:25.937 --> 29:28.773
Listen. You got one man in your pocket.

29:28.775 --> 29:31.002
I got hitters in every city...

29:31.026 --> 29:32.910
phone call away.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.063
You may want to wait.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.865
I have information
that affects your business.

30:59.866 --> 31:01.626
I don't know what
this bitch's telling you...

31:01.650 --> 31:02.817
Shut the hell up!

31:02.819 --> 31:04.319
Come here. Come here.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.855
You sold me out.

31:14.355 --> 31:16.380
You sold us out...

31:16.608 --> 31:18.159
for this.

31:18.183 --> 31:20.834
No. The Judge had me, man.

31:20.836 --> 31:22.720
You know he had me on probation,

31:22.722 --> 31:25.533
said he's gonna violate me
back to Orleans Parish Prison

31:25.557 --> 31:27.834
ten years if I ain't play ball.

31:27.858 --> 31:29.677
- No, no, listen...
- I'm sorry, man.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.372
Let it go. Don't do this, brother.

31:31.396 --> 31:33.731
We... we family!

31:36.210 --> 31:38.129
Ced...

31:38.905 --> 31:40.905
I see how you do family.

31:42.717 --> 31:44.886
I'ma show you how we do betrayal.

31:44.910 --> 31:46.327
Wait.

31:47.921 --> 31:49.397
Marcel.

31:52.250 --> 31:55.480
The Judge doesn't know we found his rat.

31:56.022 --> 31:57.421
We can use that.

32:07.825 --> 32:09.767
It's all right.

32:09.769 --> 32:11.435
This lady just bought your life.

32:18.076 --> 32:19.910
Make it worth it.

32:28.395 --> 32:32.623
I grew up with that kid, I know his mama.

32:34.351 --> 32:36.911
Had a rat, and you found him.

32:37.230 --> 32:39.247
That don't take away
what you took from me.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.193
I don't know how they do shit in Sinaloa.

32:43.468 --> 32:45.238
Bobby was familia.

32:46.305 --> 32:47.949
You're right.

32:51.285 --> 32:53.955
I thought you betrayed me to the Judge,

32:54.396 --> 32:57.098
and I ended our business deal
without listening to you.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.919
I didn't intend to kill Bobby.

33:00.735 --> 33:02.437
He made a move

33:02.439 --> 33:04.799
and died under my watch.

33:05.425 --> 33:07.385
None of this had to happen.

33:08.777 --> 33:11.779
I acted without knowing the whole story.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.253
You're goddamn right you did.

33:14.277 --> 33:16.500
There's only one person

33:16.502 --> 33:19.146
who profits off of us at war.

33:21.423 --> 33:23.317
The Judge.

33:23.341 --> 33:26.628
The only way for people
like him to stay in power

33:26.630 --> 33:30.116
is to keep people like us
at each other's throats.

33:30.754 --> 33:32.636
Slave-master mentality.

33:34.894 --> 33:36.669
Ain't a new thing around here.

33:40.693 --> 33:43.087
How are you suggesting

33:43.111 --> 33:44.964
that we move forward?

33:46.197 --> 33:49.177
I would like to resume our business deal.

33:49.702 --> 33:52.179
I will supply you a monthly shipment

33:52.203 --> 33:53.704
of my product.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.270
And this.

34:04.775 --> 34:06.811
For Bobby's family.

34:25.629 --> 34:27.797
All right.

35:15.512 --> 35:17.037
No...

36:34.758 --> 36:36.427
Lookie here.

36:36.451 --> 36:38.345
Christmas came early.

36:38.369 --> 36:41.099
There's more.

36:41.706 --> 36:42.933
Cedric called.

36:43.392 --> 36:46.327
Said Dumas struck a truce with Mendoza.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.689
How do we feel about that?

36:49.715 --> 36:53.884
As long as Ms. Mendoza
proves useful to us,

36:53.886 --> 36:56.781
it's my pleasure
to have her here as our guest.

36:57.722 --> 36:59.890
I'm nothing if not magnanimous.

37:01.893 --> 37:04.872
There's nearly half a million
in those bags.

37:04.896 --> 37:06.841
She got it liquid in a heartbeat.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.853
Her money may get us our shiny

37:11.855 --> 37:15.049
new correctional facility
much faster than we thought,

37:15.073 --> 37:18.826
where she'll have her own private room...

37:21.663 --> 37:23.997
If she survive that long.

37:27.001 --> 37:28.752
It was amazing.

37:30.505 --> 37:32.923
You made it, right?

37:36.427 --> 37:38.428
No...

37:38.430 --> 37:41.682
Hey, all I can make are
scrambled eggs, so...

37:44.328 --> 37:46.080
You seem better.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.504
Why didn't you mention Birdie?

38:00.951 --> 38:03.070
It's my fault she's gone.

38:04.705 --> 38:07.957
How is it your fault?
It was a random act of violence.

38:13.149 --> 38:15.067
It happened at my bar.

38:15.466 --> 38:18.404
Could've had better security.

38:19.614 --> 38:21.699
Could-a, should-a...

38:21.723 --> 38:23.618
Regret's gonna eat you alive.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.995
Sometimes,

38:26.561 --> 38:28.789
you spend so much time
dwelling on the past

38:29.707 --> 38:31.432
that you forget to live.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.627
I lived most of my life

38:33.651 --> 38:35.171
running from my past.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.465
That's not living.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.343
That's surviving.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.972
We should want more than that, right?

38:46.890 --> 38:48.998
Are we still talking about me?

38:59.653 --> 39:01.595
Come here.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.849
What's in it for me?

39:38.942 --> 39:40.653
He's asleep.

39:41.803 --> 39:43.530
Yeah? Finally.

39:43.554 --> 39:45.741
Poor kid hadn't been sleeping.

39:46.675 --> 39:48.725
He was waiting up for you, you know.

39:48.727 --> 39:50.894
He waited up?

39:51.539 --> 39:53.563
You're real good with him.

39:57.819 --> 39:59.486
He's a good boy.

40:02.466 --> 40:03.824
Yeah, he is.

40:06.577 --> 40:09.579
You know, I think he kinda looks
up to you like a father figure.

40:24.930 --> 40:26.365
What's wrong?

40:29.051 --> 40:30.911
It wasn't my fault.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.205
What wasn't?

40:34.557 --> 40:36.666
Everyone knows the rules.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.547
Chino knew the rules...

40:42.781 --> 40:44.091
Tony's...

40:45.616 --> 40:47.136
Tony's father.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.073
He was stealing from my boss,
and I was just following orders,

40:52.075 --> 40:54.352
and he knew the rules.

40:54.876 --> 40:57.078
That's why I felt nothing
when I squeezed the trigger

40:57.080 --> 40:59.188
and took his life.

41:01.716 --> 41:03.633
But I feel something now.

41:12.703 --> 41:14.246
Hey.

41:15.147 --> 41:17.075
It's understandable.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.542
Why?

41:20.627 --> 41:23.987
Because Tony means something to you now.
