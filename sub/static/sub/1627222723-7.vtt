09:28.159 --> 09:29.339
Okay.

09:29.439 --> 09:32.180
"Okay," what?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.941
Okay, I'm in.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.702
[Bette]
I know.

09:36.802 --> 09:38.823
I know,
I can't believe it, either.

09:38.923 --> 09:40.703
Yes, okay, yes.

09:40.803 --> 09:42.184
We'll-we'll work out
the logistics.

09:42.284 --> 09:44.425
Yeah, I know it's gonna be
a quick turnaround,

09:44.525 --> 09:46.025
but we'll get it done.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.026
All right, talk soon. Bye.

09:48.126 --> 09:50.107
[phone buzzing]

09:50.207 --> 09:52.207
[exhales sharply]

09:55.208 --> 09:56.109
Hi, Carrie.

09:56.209 --> 09:58.950
[crowd cheering]

09:59.050 --> 10:01.311
We're all suckers
for a good love story, right?

10:01.411 --> 10:03.832
Well, these two...

10:03.932 --> 10:06.072
almost make me believe
that if you find the right one,

10:06.172 --> 10:08.273
it can last a lifetime.

10:08.373 --> 10:10.474
So it is my pleasure
to introduce you

10:10.574 --> 10:12.815
to Patty and June Healey-Waters.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.316
[Sophie]
This is the Quiet Rebellion.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.117
I know you've been together
for 43 years,

10:20.217 --> 10:22.118
but I don't know how
it all started.

10:22.218 --> 10:24.919
-Well...
-I-I was a mail carrier.

10:25.019 --> 10:27.200
And I had an apartment
on Gardner.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.801
-What are you doing?
-Hi.

10:29.901 --> 10:31.481
We got to get out there.
We're missing it.

10:31.581 --> 10:33.322
No, no. It's playing right here.

10:33.422 --> 10:36.163
-Oh, God. Everything's wet.
-Oh.

10:36.263 --> 10:38.924
I feel like my socks are
fucking plastered to my leg.

10:39.024 --> 10:40.645
[laughs]
Get it off me.

10:40.745 --> 10:41.765
[Sophie]
So gross.

10:41.865 --> 10:42.845
[Finley]
Ow!

10:42.945 --> 10:44.646
-Ooh, oof!
-I'm sorry.

10:44.746 --> 10:45.967
[laughing]
Okay.

10:46.067 --> 10:47.967
Oh, God, ugh.

10:48.067 --> 10:49.368
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:49.468 --> 10:51.529
Oh, God, you look good.

10:51.629 --> 10:53.969
We can stay back here, okay?

10:54.069 --> 10:55.930
What are you talking about?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.171
I want to see everybody
flipping out for you.

10:58.271 --> 11:00.732
Oh, but what
if it doesn't go well?

11:00.832 --> 11:02.612
What, are you scared?

11:02.712 --> 11:04.893
[scoffs]
Of course I'm scared.

11:04.993 --> 11:07.494
This is the moment
of my professional life.

11:07.594 --> 11:09.255
I mean... millions of people are

11:09.355 --> 11:10.775
gonna see this thing
that I made.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.096
Hey. Hey, they're gonna love it.

11:13.196 --> 11:14.617
Come here.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.257
They are.

11:16.357 --> 11:18.218
-Hey, you want to know why?
-Hmm?

11:18.318 --> 11:20.059
It's important.

11:20.159 --> 11:22.099
And it's also
really fucking good.

11:22.199 --> 11:24.180
That's nice.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.701
It's true.

11:25.801 --> 11:27.781
You're the bestest
and the smartest.

11:27.881 --> 11:29.222
-Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah, you know that.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.622
Say more stuff.

11:30.722 --> 11:32.103
[chuckles]
And the sexiest.

11:32.203 --> 11:34.664
[both moaning]

11:34.764 --> 11:36.465
And the best kisser.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.225
Mm-hmm.
[chuckles]

11:38.325 --> 11:40.566
[audience cheering]

11:43.167 --> 11:45.628
I'm so glad you enjoyed that
as much as I did.

11:45.728 --> 11:47.228
Would you like
to see more of those?

11:47.328 --> 11:49.629
-[audience cheering]
-[woman whoops]

11:49.729 --> 11:52.070
Okay, because my producer
Sophie Suarez

11:52.170 --> 11:54.071
worked her ass off
on that segment,

11:54.171 --> 11:55.711
and I am so proud of her,

11:55.811 --> 11:57.032
so let's all give her
a big round of applause!

11:57.132 --> 11:59.273
[cheering]

11:59.373 --> 12:00.713
All right, everybody,
that's our show.

12:00.813 --> 12:02.514
And always remember, stay gay

12:02.614 --> 12:04.595
and say no to patchouli.
Thank you!

12:04.695 --> 12:06.695
-[cheering]
-[applause]

12:10.457 --> 12:13.118
That was good, Alice.
Really good.

12:13.218 --> 12:15.478
Real...? Oh, listen.
I can't take all the credit.

12:15.578 --> 12:16.799
I have to give it to Sophie.

12:16.899 --> 12:18.880
I'd like
to congratulate her myself.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.400
Okay, oh, great, great,
great, come on.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.201
Uh, listen, she would love that,

12:22.301 --> 12:23.761
because she's kind of shitting
bricks in the greenroom,

12:23.861 --> 12:25.522
-and she'll be really relieved.
-[chuckles]

12:25.622 --> 12:27.563
I always find
if you surround yourself

12:27.663 --> 12:29.323
with a more youthful staff,

12:29.423 --> 12:31.684
it just kind of brings
a life and, and an energy

12:31.784 --> 12:33.005
to the show that I...

12:33.105 --> 12:34.685
-[moaning]
-[Sophie gasps]

12:34.785 --> 12:36.526
[Finley]
Oh, shit.

12:36.626 --> 12:37.886
-Everything okay?
-[clattering]

12:37.986 --> 12:39.967
Yeah, they're naked.
They're, um...

12:40.067 --> 12:41.648
uh... um...

12:41.748 --> 12:43.208
They're totally exposed.

12:43.308 --> 12:45.169
Emotionally.

12:45.269 --> 12:46.930
Oh, okay.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.010
Well, maybe I can come back.

12:49.110 --> 12:50.531
You know what? Now's not
a good time, but call...

12:50.631 --> 12:51.931
[Gigi]
So I walk

12:52.031 --> 12:53.572
by the car... thank you...
car window...

12:53.672 --> 12:55.013
-Chicken?
-Sí, señora.

12:55.113 --> 12:56.453
-Thank you.
-Walk by the car window

12:56.553 --> 12:57.774
and I see her fucking head

12:57.874 --> 12:58.974
popping out of the sunroof.

12:59.074 --> 13:00.214
[laughs]
Oh, my God.

13:00.314 --> 13:02.215
No, I literally...

13:02.315 --> 13:04.056
It took everything in me not
to knock on the window

13:04.156 --> 13:05.736
and fuck with Alice a little.

13:05.836 --> 13:07.457
You absolutely
should've done it.

13:07.557 --> 13:09.258
I mean, there will be
plenty of chances.

13:09.358 --> 13:13.779
That woman's love
for public sex knows no bounds.

13:13.879 --> 13:15.660
[sighs]

13:15.760 --> 13:18.301
So, we gonna talk
about the other night?

13:18.401 --> 13:21.302
I was hoping to just
skip over it, actually.

13:21.402 --> 13:23.383
[laughs]
Okay.

13:23.483 --> 13:26.024
She's a "lock it in the closet

13:26.124 --> 13:27.464
and throw away the key" type.

13:27.564 --> 13:28.985
My favorite.

13:29.085 --> 13:30.465
No, I just...

13:30.565 --> 13:32.066
Um...

13:32.166 --> 13:34.267
If you don't feel
the same way, that's okay.

13:34.367 --> 13:36.267
I'm a big girl.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.788
I can handle it.

13:38.888 --> 13:41.009
No, I just thought it was
kind of shitty, actually.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.851
Me telling you I have feelings
for you was shitty?

13:48.372 --> 13:50.472
Well...

13:50.572 --> 13:52.713
I had a fucking horrible night.

13:52.813 --> 13:55.514
To see the two of them
like that, it...

13:55.614 --> 13:57.675
-Mm-hmm.
-And then...

13:57.775 --> 13:59.556
you made me feel good.

13:59.656 --> 14:01.656
But then I needed a friend.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.418
So we're friends?

14:05.898 --> 14:07.638
It-It's all just too fast.
[sighs]

14:07.738 --> 14:09.159
Okay. We can slow down.

14:09.259 --> 14:10.319
And it's Bette.

14:10.419 --> 14:12.420
I don't think she'll care.

14:13.661 --> 14:16.362
I would never want someone to
feel the way I did when Sophie--

14:16.462 --> 14:18.782
I don't think Bette had
very strong feelings for me.

14:20.023 --> 14:22.304
I find that hard to believe.
[chuckles]

14:26.825 --> 14:29.406
If that's what this is
really about,

14:29.506 --> 14:31.667
you need to talk to her.

14:35.668 --> 14:39.130
Hey, guys, what the fuck?!

14:39.230 --> 14:40.930
-[Finley stammers]
-Barry wanted to see you.

14:41.030 --> 14:42.011
My God. He did?

14:42.111 --> 14:43.811
I-I'm sorry.

14:43.911 --> 14:46.412
Look, I'm so sorry. I-I-I just
got really nervous and then...

14:46.512 --> 14:47.733
Can this just be my fault?

14:47.833 --> 14:50.054
I don't even work here anymore.

14:50.154 --> 14:52.054
What is it about that couch?

14:52.154 --> 14:54.255
Well, I think
it's less about the couch

14:54.355 --> 14:56.356
and more about the location
of the room.

14:57.756 --> 14:59.377
Right?

14:59.477 --> 15:01.458
I'll stop talking.

15:01.558 --> 15:04.419
[sighs]

15:04.519 --> 15:05.739
You know what,
I like you two together.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.420
I do. Big fan.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.020
I just want to see less of it.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.121
-We can do that.
-Copy. Less.

15:11.961 --> 15:14.262
Febreze the shit out
of that couch before you leave.

15:14.362 --> 15:16.543
-Absolutely.
-Copy. Febreze-ing.

15:16.643 --> 15:19.264
[Angie] Jordi's amazing
for so many reasons.

15:19.364 --> 15:22.105
But it-it just feels like we're
dealing with different stuff.

15:22.205 --> 15:24.666
Mm. Like with my dad?

15:24.766 --> 15:26.587
Exactly.

15:26.687 --> 15:28.467
In the beginning she was cool.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.788
But now she just seems
preoccupied...

15:30.888 --> 15:32.469
with other stuff.

15:32.569 --> 15:34.969
Like prom and parties.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.991
That seems kind of fun,
actually.

15:39.091 --> 15:40.672
Yeah, no, totally.

15:40.772 --> 15:43.913
Um... but earlier today,

15:44.013 --> 15:46.474
I was trying to think
of questions to ask your dad

15:46.574 --> 15:49.155
for when I meet him, which
you would think would be easy,

15:49.255 --> 15:51.035
but it's actually super hard.

15:51.135 --> 15:52.836
Well, if you want,
I can answer anything.

15:52.936 --> 15:54.076
Or if you want help
thinking of questions,

15:54.176 --> 15:55.077
I could do that, too.

15:55.177 --> 15:57.478
Yes, that's the type of stuff

15:57.578 --> 16:00.639
I want her to say, but...

16:00.739 --> 16:02.639
-she just...
-She doesn't.

16:02.739 --> 16:05.040
Yeah.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.721
Have you ever broken up
with somebody before?

16:07.821 --> 16:09.722
Mm-mm.

16:09.822 --> 16:12.803
♪ Last night, called you
a hundred times ♪

16:12.903 --> 16:14.964
♪ Felt so alone ♪

16:15.064 --> 16:17.765
♪ In my bedroom ♪

16:17.865 --> 16:20.966
♪ So lost, I don't even ♪

16:21.066 --> 16:25.207
♪ Know why you are feelin'
just like home... ♪

16:25.307 --> 16:26.688
Oh, man.

16:26.788 --> 16:28.088
What do you want for dinner?

16:28.188 --> 16:29.809
Uh...

16:29.909 --> 16:32.610
I could do Chinese,
pizza, mac and cheese.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.091
-Your call.
-Do you know how to cook?

16:35.191 --> 16:36.892
Yeah, I can make stuff.
What do you want?

16:36.992 --> 16:38.932
No, I just...

16:39.032 --> 16:42.133
want to know
if you can feed yourself.

16:42.233 --> 16:43.934
Oh, I see.

16:44.034 --> 16:46.695
-Like a test.
-[Sophie sighs]

16:46.795 --> 16:49.336
No, that's not what I meant.

16:49.436 --> 16:51.677
Think I'm like a big kid,
don't you?

16:52.917 --> 16:54.458
Well, you...

16:54.558 --> 16:57.019
kind of, sort of are.

16:57.119 --> 16:59.059
Look, I know I'm not
as grown up as Dani.

16:59.159 --> 17:00.820
-Okay.
-Or whatever, but my parents

17:00.920 --> 17:02.621
kicked me out
when I was 18, so...

17:02.721 --> 17:04.261
sort of different circumstances.

17:04.361 --> 17:06.462
I never compared you
to her, okay?

17:06.562 --> 17:07.743
Would never do that.

17:07.843 --> 17:09.103
It's fine, whatever.

17:09.203 --> 17:10.303
If you got doubts about me,
I want to know.

17:10.403 --> 17:12.304
I don't, okay?

17:12.404 --> 17:14.225
It's just...

17:14.325 --> 17:16.326
-I...
-What?

17:17.246 --> 17:20.547
Look, we just know each other
in, you know, one...

17:20.647 --> 17:23.508
way, and... I'm trying
to get to know you

17:23.608 --> 17:25.609
in a different way.

17:26.889 --> 17:28.470
Okay. What do you want to know?

17:28.570 --> 17:30.391
I'm an open book.

17:30.491 --> 17:33.112
Okay... well...

17:33.212 --> 17:34.672
hmm.

17:34.772 --> 17:37.393
Do you want kids?

17:37.493 --> 17:39.794
Hell yes.
Like a fuck-ton of 'em.

17:39.894 --> 17:41.114
[laughs]
Okay.

17:41.214 --> 17:43.275
What else you got?

17:43.375 --> 17:46.036
Well... what about...

17:46.136 --> 17:48.137
career ambitions?

17:50.098 --> 17:52.278
Uh...
[laughs]

17:52.378 --> 17:55.440
I'm hoping
this reffing kids' soccer

17:55.540 --> 17:57.280
kind of turns into a real thing.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.241
But...

18:00.341 --> 18:02.762
I'm also down to be
a stay-at-home baby daddy.

18:02.862 --> 18:05.523
-[Sophie chuckles]
-And, yes, before you even ask,

18:05.623 --> 18:07.324
of course
you can be my sugar mama.

18:07.424 --> 18:10.125
Ooh... okay.

18:10.225 --> 18:12.206
What, you want me to go
to an online college?

18:12.306 --> 18:14.006
Get a degree
in the medical field?

18:14.106 --> 18:15.567
-I can do that.
-[clears throat]

18:15.667 --> 18:17.848
-I've seen the commercials.
-Mm-hmm.

gonna get messy.

Oh, well, thank you

21:25.694 --> 21:28.235
for allowing me to crash
your marvelous event.

21:28.335 --> 21:29.876
Of course.
I'm glad you could make it.

21:29.976 --> 21:31.917
It's a really nice place
to bring a date, you know?

21:32.017 --> 21:33.557
-Good lighting, romantic...
-Um, actually

21:33.657 --> 21:35.318
we are out celebrating the fact

21:35.418 --> 21:38.039
that Pippa has agreed
to sign with the gallery.

-Oh, congratulations.

21:39.739 --> 21:41.120
Thank you, thank you very much.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.801
No, thank you, 'cause this one,

21:42.901 --> 21:44.801
she goes on and on and on
and on and on and on about you.

-Alice.
-Please tell me, I would love

21:46.462 --> 21:47.782
-to hear more about that.
-I mean, that was just going on

21:47.862 --> 21:49.043
-for months, right?
-I would say years.

21:49.143 --> 21:50.323
-No... ha, years.
-Definitely years.

What can I do?"

21:53.024 --> 21:55.025

-No.

21:55.905 --> 21:57.906
[Shane]
Is that Carrie?

21:59.426 --> 22:02.087
Oh. Yeah. She called
and asked if she could come,

22:02.187 --> 22:03.968
even though Tina was out
of town. I couldn't say no.

22:04.068 --> 22:06.529
Very nice of you.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.630
There's no reason
we can't all get along.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.371
-At separate tables.
-I got it covered.

22:12.471 --> 22:15.652
We're gonna go try
to find our table.

about those two.

the way for everybody.

and I was... blown away.

-You know, I responded to it,

24:19.876 --> 24:21.857
too, which I think is impressive

to see how you are.

-Full disclosure, Carrie.
-Yeah.

25:13.175 --> 25:16.197
Um, took a friend
to an AA meeting.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.797
And I saw you there.

25:17.897 --> 25:19.358
I know it's not my business,
I just...

25:19.458 --> 25:21.198
I love Tina. She's family, so

-if there's anything I can do...
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

You know, for eating,
not for drinking.

the same thing.

not really a secret, you know?

26:02.753 --> 26:04.694
My life is kind of an open book.

26:04.794 --> 26:06.855
Yeah, you know,
I haven't been, uh...

26:06.955 --> 26:08.895

26:08.995 --> 26:12.697

as I try to navigate your world.

26:12.797 --> 26:15.258

-Well, um...

26:15.358 --> 26:17.378

just you all, I mean...

26:17.478 --> 26:19.339

-Right. [clears throat]

26:19.439 --> 26:21.180
-Right.
-...fit in.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.901
It won't surprise you,
I don't think, to hear

26:24.001 --> 26:26.182
that I'm still sort of
struggling with Bette Porter.

26:26.282 --> 26:28.262
[sighs]
Yeah.

26:28.362 --> 26:31.703
Look, that's a, uh...
delicate situation,

26:31.803 --> 26:34.705
and you just have
to give it time.

26:34.805 --> 26:37.065
Just every time I'm around her,
Shane, I feel like

26:37.165 --> 26:39.066
I'm a different species,
you know?

26:39.166 --> 26:40.947
-You're not.
-I mean, I just,

26:41.047 --> 26:42.707
if she got to know me,

26:42.807 --> 26:44.348
I think she would
really like me.

26:44.448 --> 26:46.029
You got to give it time,
all right?

26:46.129 --> 26:47.869
-All right.
-Just-just be patient.

26:47.969 --> 26:49.710
Yeah, I just feel
like I really want to try,

26:49.810 --> 26:52.231
because, I mean,
something's got to change.

26:52.331 --> 26:54.552
-Go slow, all right?
-Okay.

26:54.652 --> 26:56.672
-Thank you, thank you.
-Yes, yes. Okay.

26:56.772 --> 26:58.273
-Thank you. All right.
-Have a good night, Carrie.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.380
Okay.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.581
It's so funny,
I just had a total flashback

30:09.681 --> 30:11.862
of my high school
in Staten Island,

30:11.962 --> 30:13.663
that when I would ask
all the cool girls

30:13.763 --> 30:15.943
if I could sit
with them at lunch,

30:16.043 --> 30:18.784
they would just, like, you know,
whisper, "She's such a dyke."

30:18.884 --> 30:20.225
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

30:20.325 --> 30:21.986
That was obviously not
my intention.

30:22.086 --> 30:23.106
Oh, no, I didn't mean that.

30:23.206 --> 30:25.387
-At all.
-No, no, I know. Yeah.

30:25.487 --> 30:27.027
Well, if it's any consolation,
I mean, I had

30:27.127 --> 30:28.908
a similar experience...

30:29.008 --> 30:30.909
-but it was soccer camp.
-Yeah.

30:31.009 --> 30:32.909
There were two girls,
and they would whisper

30:33.009 --> 30:35.310
"Nigger dyke" behind my back.

30:35.410 --> 30:37.071
They'd try to get me
to sit in the back

30:38.571 --> 30:39.872

Okay.

30:41.572 --> 30:43.113

I'm-I'm completely happy
to be totally civil.

beyond that

I was feeling really good.

You know, I had,
like, a bounce in my step.

31:36.672 --> 31:39.133
I got this new outfit on, and...

31:39.233 --> 31:42.174
then I was up there
and I saw you.

31:42.274 --> 31:44.295
I just want you to know,

31:44.395 --> 31:46.816
it does not feel good
to be around you.

would be nice.

really good about it,
