Oh, it's gorgeous.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.859
- But I have zero estrogen.
At all.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.262
I have zero.
- Yeah, you said that before--

17:10.329 --> 17:12.131
- Hi.
- Hi, hi.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.065
- Gorgeous home, my gosh.
- It's super hot.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.466
- It's toasty.
- How are you?

17:15.302 --> 17:16.867
- Hi. Your home is so gorgeous.
- Hi.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.803
- Oh, thank you.
I haven't seen you in forever.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.738
- I know.
- Since Mexico.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.874
- Since, like, ten years ago,
it seems like.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.840
- You're not the only one
wearing white.

17:22.909 --> 17:23.808
- I'm not the only one
wearing a dress.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.178
- Thank for having us.
That is for you.

17:26.245 --> 17:28.347
- Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.316
Every time I see Noella,
I do the same thing.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.348
"Hi. How are you?"

17:31.417 --> 17:33.551
And just, like,
hope that nothing bad happens.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.286
Hasn't worked out well
historically.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.087
- Hi, guys.
- Hi. How are you?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.489
You look so pretty.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.491
- [laughs]

17:40.560 --> 17:41.761
- Micro!

17:41.762 --> 17:43.561
Don't let the kids see it.
- Oh, no, I won't.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.829
- Okay. Yeah.
- No, I won't.

17:44.765 --> 17:46.630
- Don't let the kids see it.
- The kids were anti.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.634
- In recent times,
since marijuana's become legal,

17:49.702 --> 17:51.702
I decided to experiment
a little bit.

17:51.703 --> 17:54.173
And I have to say, little bites,

17:54.174 --> 17:57.410
a little microdose of an edible
is kind of fabulous.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.212
And Shannon and edibles
do very well together.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.445
Shannon, do tiny bites.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.248
- She taught me something
called microdosing.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.783
- That's right.
- And it might have worked

18:05.852 --> 18:07.117
for me.
- It did.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.919
- #Micro.

Are you okay?

18:17.463 --> 18:19.664

Are you okay?

18:34.148 --> 18:35.146
- Um...

18:35.081 --> 18:36.680
- Your kids had
their first day of school.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.082
- They had
their first day at school.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.483
- Which was very exciting.
- That is exciting.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.153
- And it was a successful day.
- That's exciting.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.220
- And they were happy.
- Yeah.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.555
- Their favorite part was
the cafeteria and recess.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.490

Yay. Yeah.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.493

18:48.561 --> 18:50.630
- What?
- Holy sh--.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.163
- I thought she wasn't
gonna talk about it.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.966
[laughs]
I was like...

18:53.967 --> 18:56.269
- I just stopped crying
for 13 hours.

18:56.270 --> 18:57.368
- Why?
- But I'd like to.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.236

18:58.304 --> 18:59.436
Was there something
that led up to it?

18:59.505 --> 19:00.437
- And you don't talk about it
if you don't want to.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.373
But if you wanna talk
about it, talk about it.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.173
- I was talking about my day.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.776
I had a challenging day.
- Mm-hmm.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.712
- And I was reaching out
for support,

19:07.780 --> 19:10.114
and he was not able
to give me support.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.316
And so, then he lashes out.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.250
And it was just
a very big lash-out.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.987
- Uh-huh. I'm sorry.
- Like, a very big one.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.722
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.792
- Shane and I, when we hit
10 and 11 years together,

19:21.861 --> 19:24.463
that was our lowest of lows
in our marriage.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.063
You're being rude to me
right now.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.199
- Well, any time I ask--
- You asked me a question.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.169
- I know. And every answer is,
"I don't know."

19:30.170 --> 19:31.735
- Because I don't know.

19:31.736 --> 19:34.338
- Shh.
I'm right here, babe.

19:34.407 --> 19:38.677
- And we managed
to make 12 and 13 the best.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.444
- That's great.
- Best.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.780
- How did you do that?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.547
- A lot of work.
- 'Cause I'll...

19:43.616 --> 19:46.483
- A lot of counseling.
- Take any advice as possible.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.419
- We went to marriage therapy.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.686
- There's
a relationship boot camp.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.521
- I did that.
- Church?

19:50.522 --> 19:52.223
- Relationship boot camp.
It was great.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.758
- With Tina?
- With Tina. Yes.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.628
- We are not going
to coddle anyone.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.697
We're not gonna
validate your feelings.

19:59.765 --> 20:03.367
And everyone needs to own their
stuff for us to move forward.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.803
- This is a devastating day
for me

20:04.870 --> 20:09.374
because--
Because I lost my soul mate.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.443
- David, you were more
of a husband

20:12.512 --> 20:14.580
that I could have ever imagined.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.250
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

20:17.251 --> 20:18.783
- That was
really, really helpful.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.384
- Yeah.
- And for a couple of weeks,

20:20.385 --> 20:21.585
it was, like, amazing.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.587
- You know
what else Shane and I did,

20:22.655 --> 20:25.522
and this might sound corny
or cliche or whatever,

20:25.591 --> 20:29.127
we actually sat down and we
wrote out a mission statement

20:29.195 --> 20:30.427
for our marriage and our family.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.796
- Oh, I love that.
- We did.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.464
And he wrote it out.
- That's good.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.301
- That's very you.
- That is very me.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.769
- I like that.
- I like that.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.736
- I remember,
it was at a bagel shop.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.739
We had a bagel,
and I sat across from him,

20:40.806 --> 20:45.278
and I said, "I am so unhappy.
And I think you're unhappy too.

20:45.279 --> 20:47.279
<i>"And I don't want to be
in this marriage anymore</i>

20:47.346 --> 20:49.213
<i>because it's not good
for anyone."</i>

20:49.214 --> 20:50.749
And that day,

20:50.816 --> 20:55.152
he completely recommitted
himself to me and our marriage.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.187
- What would you say

20:56.188 --> 20:58.357
the mission statement
for your marriage is?

20:58.358 --> 20:59.690
- Well, we had certain words,

20:59.759 --> 21:01.759
and some of mine were
"teaching each other."

21:01.827 --> 21:03.560
There was "unconditional love"

21:03.629 --> 21:06.532
and, you know, "acceptance"
and things like that.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.299
And I think that's where
the turning point was for me.

21:09.369 --> 21:13.437
- 100%, he has lived by what
he said every day since then.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.574
- I'm gonna write a mission
statement for our friendship.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.442
And then, every time
you get unruly,

21:17.510 --> 21:18.643
I'm gonna send it to you.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.179
- Why don't we go inside
where it's cooler?

21:21.247 --> 21:22.880
- Okay. I'll follow you.
Okay. Let's go.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.716
- I am--
- No, I was being serious.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.849
Like, we really did.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.319
- I'm truly sorry.
- Thank you.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.521
- Yay, lookit.
Yay.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.589
- Hi, Ryne.
- He exists. He's in the flesh.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.191

21:34.260 --> 21:35.526
- It's Ryne!
- It's Ryne!

21:35.594 --> 21:37.762
- It's Ryne!
- Not Ryan.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.712
or are we sticking
with the champagne?

21:54.780 --> 21:56.147
- I'll stick with champagne.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.749

cucumber salad to start,

you both have to want it.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.936
And you both have to show up.
- Exactly. Exactly.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.837
- And if only one person
is showing up,

22:19.905 --> 22:22.707
the other one can't carry that,
'cause I did that for so long.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.708
- But that's what I feel like.
- Yeah.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.777

23:07.053 --> 23:09.553

with divorce papers

23:11.624 --> 23:14.225
that we were even
in that realm of thought.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.429
He took it a little far.
Maybe he regrets that.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.563
And maybe he'll
reel it back in and say,

23:19.632 --> 23:20.464
"That was a bit much
on my part."

That would be wonderful.
- Maybe.

- Just in case he doesn't,

23:25.472 --> 23:27.973
know that there is potential
that he's getting counsel.

- I think that's too--I think
you're jumping too far ahead.

Like, she just needs to be in
the moment that he just left.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.784
And we just have to focus...
- Okay.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.052
- On that and try
to get them back together.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.489

- Yeah.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.756
- Yeah, he's back.
- Yeah.

and very cool all the time.

or anything like that,

40:33.999 --> 40:34.931
does that bother you?

40:37.469 --> 40:40.738
- No. I mean, I have my own
relationship with Heather.

40:40.805 --> 40:42.605
And if she would've asked me
to go to New York,

40:42.674 --> 40:43.940
I would say,
"I'm freaking exhausted.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.074
Sorry.
Have a good time."

40:45.075 --> 40:48.544
No, but, like, you're thinking
I'm acting jealous?

40:48.613 --> 40:51.347
- No, she was telling me
that at your lunch,

40:51.416 --> 40:54.886
that when Heather was talking
about her skincare line,

40:54.887 --> 40:57.553
that she thought that
you got really jealous.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.991
Like, she accomplished this
and she started a business

40:59.992 --> 41:02.725
and, like, how great she was,
and that maybe--

41:02.794 --> 41:04.694
- You know what, that's
an asshole comment to make

41:04.695 --> 41:06.829
because I have
my own skincare coming up

41:06.898 --> 41:10.099
and I don't talk about it
'cause I'm excited for Gina.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.435
And I told her that.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.972
What?
[stammers]

41:13.973 --> 41:17.640
Where from the sky
was this pulled from?

41:17.709 --> 41:19.108
- I guess because
maybe it looked like

41:19.109 --> 41:21.744
you were, like, not happy
that Heather was,

41:21.813 --> 41:23.046
like, saying something
and, like, promoting her.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.515
- But how did it look like
I wasn't happy?

41:25.516 --> 41:27.717
- Oh, those are beautiful.

41:27.786 --> 41:31.322
- Yeah, so excited for you.
So excited for you.

41:32.857 --> 41:34.057

I was so pissed at Noella,

I didn't see anything else.
I don't know.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.394

41:38.463 --> 41:40.129
I have a lot of sh--
On the plate,

41:40.198 --> 41:42.999
and skincare is one of the ten.

41:43.067 --> 41:46.002
So if Gina's doing skincare,
all the power to her.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.537
- No, I think
it was more of, like,

41:47.605 --> 41:49.873
you and Heather
are supposed to be close,

41:49.941 --> 41:52.541
but it's more like
Heather and Gina are close.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.543
Like, does that bother you?

41:54.613 --> 41:56.948
- Once again, no.
- Okay.

41:56.949 --> 42:00.149
- Gina's ego, sorry, needs
to put a little pin in it.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.084
Emily, every time
I sit down with her,

42:02.153 --> 42:03.819
freaking stirring the pot.

42:03.888 --> 42:06.423
I'm not jealous. I got
enough sh-- on my plate.

42:06.491 --> 42:08.157
I'm not thinking
about you Gina all the time.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.626
Sorry.
Sorry to disappoint you.
