WEBVTT

00:10.040 --> 00:13.000
She will choose
among you a band.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.480
One of them will betray you.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.200
Soon she will appear to us
carrying the spear to smite

00:20.240 --> 00:22.160
the Roman Devils.
Yeah!

00:22.200 --> 00:24.400
Prison camp's
on the plain, north of here.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.600
Have they got Lucius?

00:25.640 --> 00:28.000
There's a spear
that everybody wants.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.720
Aulus wants it.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.320
I have it.
Hmm?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.480
Oh, cool.
Look to the general.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.880
Hello, old friend.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.280
What's the very last thing
Veran wants?

00:42.320 --> 00:43.480
He has come.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.480
I must see him.
I must speak with him.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.440
He's not here to speak.
He's here to destroy.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.800
We have to go now.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.560
Something is wrong. But whatever
Veran planned, it wasn't this.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.760
Do you want to play?

01:45.360 --> 01:47.960
No fair.
Again.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.640
You won.
Here, this is for you.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.160
♪ Well you can bump and grind

02:25.320 --> 02:28.600
♪ It is good for your mind

02:28.640 --> 02:32.320
♪ Well you can twist and shout

02:32.360 --> 02:34.320
♪ Let it all hang out

02:34.360 --> 02:39.520
♪ But you won't fool
The children of the revolution

02:39.560 --> 02:55.520
♪ No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

02:55.560 --> 02:58.360
♪ No, no, no

02:59.600 --> 03:02.000
♪ Yeah! ♪

03:37.080 --> 03:38.880
He must be in that one.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.480
We have to stop them on the road.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.240
If they reach camp,
it won't get easier.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.400
I said you'd need an army.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.560
Good morning, General.
Morning, Blain.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.560
Did we sleep well?
-Yeah, like a log actually.
-Ah.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.480
Thank you, Pilus.
You may leave us.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.360
So you spoke
with the prisoner.

04:19.400 --> 04:22.600
My old Praefectus,
Lucius Validus?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.920
Yeah.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.400
What did he tell you?

04:27.440 --> 04:29.800
Pretty much
everything I reckon.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.680
He said he knew he wasn't going
to be killed yesterday,

04:32.720 --> 04:35.080
because he was
on a different path.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.800
Go on.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.040
Well...

04:39.080 --> 04:41.080
Forgiveness.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.720
Yeah, forgiveness.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.360
No, sorry, can you speak
in sentences,

04:45.400 --> 04:48.720
not just individual words?
-And there's a sword.
-A sword?

04:48.760 --> 04:52.800
A special sword.
The Sword of the Sliding Door.

04:52.840 --> 04:56.560
A spear perhaps?
Could be. In fact...

04:56.600 --> 05:00.200
It was the Spear of the Silver Dawn?
Did he tell you where it is?

05:00.240 --> 05:02.040
Yes.
Yes.

05:02.080 --> 05:05.480
Do you wanna?
Yeah. They...

05:05.520 --> 05:09.520
buried it
at the High Ridge of Sultan.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.720
East of...

05:12.760 --> 05:14.760
of uh...

05:14.800 --> 05:17.200
Drumhummund.
Pilus!

05:25.520 --> 05:27.280
I got your message.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.400
Very enigmatic.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.920
There was lots of discussion
about what it might represent.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.440
Is it a sword perhaps? Or a
crucifix? Or maybe be a spear?

05:38.360 --> 05:40.200
Why don't you tell me
about this spear?

05:40.240 --> 05:43.240
In fact, just skip that,
and tell me where I can find it.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.480
What was your message
if it wasn't "come and find me,"

05:47.520 --> 05:49.680
you fucker?
Hm?

05:49.720 --> 05:53.280
So I got your message
and I came to find you, fucker.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.240
So how many other people
have you reached out to?

05:55.280 --> 05:58.080
How many more people
are coming to find you? Hmm?

05:58.120 --> 06:01.680
Because this spear is only
half the story, isn't it?

06:01.720 --> 06:04.640
This spear is actually
powerless in your hands.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.360
Powerful enough to drag
a Roman General

06:07.400 --> 06:09.720
and his cohort
across the country.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.880
You want that spear so badly
it eats you up,

06:15.920 --> 06:18.920
makes you do
diabolical things.

06:20.320 --> 06:25.280
But I have a light inside,
to guide me.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.680
So I'll keep on following it.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.840
See where it leads.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.440
You know what I will do to you.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.680
You, more than anyone,
know what comes next.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.280
I have faced my wrongs.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.920
You can't even begin.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.360
Where's this road?
You promised a road.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.920
My husband's road,
the one he's following.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.560
You said "near."
It's not near, is it? Is it?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.200
If it were,
we'd be making good time.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.400
Not wading through a fucking jungle.
It's a little further.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.440
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm not his fucking puppy!

07:06.600 --> 07:09.000
Oh.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.160
I...
I can't hear this side.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.520
No.
Stone deaf in this one.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.000
Does it bleed?

07:21.040 --> 07:23.200
There's no wound.
Sure?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.160
Mmhmm.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Why did you save me?

07:31.120 --> 07:32.960
I want to know Lokka.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.280
To serve him.
I've told you this.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.760
You'd have sacrificed yourself?

07:39.800 --> 07:43.120
Oh.
You'd have done that?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.520
I would.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.880
You do this well,
little bird.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.280
We'll put a pin in you
for now.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.680
Get your freedom!

08:12.720 --> 08:14.520
Come on!

08:16.320 --> 08:18.680
You know, all this is mad.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.720
He's mad.
He's completely mad. He's mad.

08:21.760 --> 08:26.120
He sacrificed his own son.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.720
That's mad.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.160
Why ever would he do that?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.400
Did he tell you...

08:33.440 --> 08:36.200
he started seeing things?

08:36.240 --> 08:39.040
No. He never mentioned it.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.080
Hmm.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.960
What will you do to him?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.680
Well, the beauty of it is,

08:45.720 --> 08:48.920
when you get it right,
and fuck me if I've got it right,

08:48.960 --> 08:51.640
they do it to themselves.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.040
They just need...

08:55.080 --> 08:56.880
a little push.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.280
You're back.

09:07.320 --> 09:11.000
You're rather brilliant. This way.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.080
Then, there's the girl.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.720
She's different strawberries.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.520
She's alone.
All alone.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.800
We're just a rotting
old fable to cling to.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.960
I sent her the boy.
That got things rolling.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.120
That's not nice.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.360
That'll be on her mind.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.680
Nibbling.
Those others, right?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.720
Who we got?

09:47.160 --> 09:50.720
Huh.
What the fuck was that? Hmm?

09:50.760 --> 09:54.840
All my birds in one nest.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.200
The twerps,
they can surprise you.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.720
Then there's my girl.

10:08.760 --> 10:13.280
She's doing rather well.
If she keeps it up, we're in.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.280
Steady now.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.280
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.280
You're seeing this?
How are you seeing this?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.880
Are you serious?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.400
I'm 900 feet tall.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.520
I fly.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.320
I see everything.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.800
A monster.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.560
I count 14 legs.
How does it stay up there?

10:47.600 --> 10:51.200
It's made of stone.
Impossible.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.040
We should leave this place.
Immediately.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.520
I've seen this before.
In Gaul.

10:55.560 --> 11:00.440
The road the Romans are following,
this carries it across the valley.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.800
So...
It's a road in the air.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.800
Sky is no place for roads.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.440
Sky belongs to the wild birds.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.440
-Feather and wing.
-To cross it,
they'll have to break formation.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.080
It's perfect.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.840
Right, they'll be
up there by nightfall.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.320
If we stop them halfway...
that's when we go in.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.040
Then we're in the trap too.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.200
Our horses
won't last another night.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.480
If it's not now, then...

11:49.480 --> 11:53.000
I see doubt in you.
I chose everyone who's here.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.920
So why would I choose a traitor?

11:55.960 --> 11:59.320
If everything I do is the prophecy,
then explain that.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.640
Why would I do that to us?

12:04.960 --> 12:09.120
If we fail to rescue him,
that's the end, isn't it?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.600
Then, what?

12:12.240 --> 12:15.240
What happens after the end?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.040
We won't fail.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.520
Why don't I know that?

12:35.120 --> 12:37.760
The river,

12:37.800 --> 12:41.400
it belongs to Sulis.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.320
It sprang from her womb
as the green world began.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.160
It's her child.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.640
She's a mother.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.120
She would summon Morrigan,

12:59.160 --> 13:03.680
mighty Senuna, Taranis himself
would answer her call.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.440
Their eyes, flaming fury,

13:06.480 --> 13:09.600
would swallow these devils
for what they do here.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.880
Where are they?

13:14.880 --> 13:16.920
Where are they?

13:27.280 --> 13:31.520
Count your lucky stars.
At least you've got Big Pebble.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.520
-Who are you?
-Hmm?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.800
Who the fuck are you?

14:12.520 --> 14:17.480
What's the game? I know the game.
Revenge on my husband.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.120
Then I show up
and spoil the fun.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
That's insane.
You know he told me.

14:22.200 --> 14:26.040
Twisted your family
to pieces, didn't he?

14:26.080 --> 14:28.320
Poor baby.

14:28.360 --> 14:32.840
What's keeping you?
Show some balls!

14:32.880 --> 14:35.280
If I wanted you dead,

14:35.320 --> 14:38.240
you don't think I could've done
that?

14:38.280 --> 14:40.120
I could've slit his throat
while you were sleeping.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.800
I could've left you
to burn in that villa!

14:42.840 --> 14:46.480
I saved your life.
I did that!

14:46.520 --> 14:48.800
No, you didn't.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.880
What do you remember?

14:57.840 --> 15:00.040
In Rome.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.360
The night you went away.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.080
Do you remember everything?
I don't want to remember.

15:09.720 --> 15:13.920
I hide myself in clouds.
So I don't think about it.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.560
That night...

15:18.600 --> 15:20.440
I took you somewhere.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.600
It was dark. I didn't like it.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.240
It was my fault, wasn't it?

15:26.280 --> 15:29.000
What did I do, Daddy?
Oh, no!

15:30.040 --> 15:32.520
No, my love.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.720
She won't take you again.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.920
I'll be all yours
and you'll be all mine.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.720
But I'm not just yours anymore...

15:51.960 --> 15:55.040
I thought you knew.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.560
Precious one.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.920
I saw it from the first time
I met you.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.200
What are you saying?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.240
Your sacrifices.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.200
You gave'd me away.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.840
Have you forgotten
the promise you made?

16:15.880 --> 16:18.800
What sacrifices?

16:18.840 --> 16:21.320
What daddy did?

16:21.360 --> 16:24.360
Your sister...

16:24.400 --> 16:25.680
Your daughter?

16:25.720 --> 16:29.160
No.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.160
No. No.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.800
There you go.
At the edge of your eyes.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.720
Now you understand.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.880
Look at me.
I belong to her now.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.280
No.
Yes.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.520
She loves me.
No.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.640
He found you
when you were small.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.440
He's always been in you.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.280
Everything you've done
was for Lokka.

17:01.320 --> 17:16.800
Spill the blood.
Drink his love.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.880
That's why you saved me.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.680
Oh!
That's a relief.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.920
Can I trust you?
What's the matter?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.200
Can we do this?
Of course we can.

20:29.240 --> 20:32.080
We've got the finest military
brains in the land with us.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.000
What's your problem?

20:34.040 --> 20:36.440
We won't get another chance.
This is it.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.440
Are we all going to die?
The thought had crossed my mind.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.040
There is another option.
Tell me.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.520
Run.
I'm serious.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.040
Leave this entire charade
to someone else.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.160
There's still a world where
you're just Cait from the salt farm.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.800
Trust me,
it might feel that,

20:53.840 --> 20:55.960
that girl is a long way away
right now,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.640
but she isn't,
she's still here.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.200
Do you want the truth?

21:05.240 --> 21:08.280
I'm not sure I even remember
her clearly.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.760
I'm this now.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.320
I made a choice.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.840
That's what I was afraid
you'd say.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.480
I gave up
the red thread...

21:30.880 --> 21:33.200
The witch was too strong.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.960
I know. Don't cry, child.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.760
Don't.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.240
I'll show you.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.280
My betrayal.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.440
No, child. Your sacrifice!

22:23.680 --> 22:25.920
It's her!

22:30.000 --> 22:33.080
Sacrifice is all.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.520
Without it,
there is no faith.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.000
How else shall the Gods
know we love them?

22:54.320 --> 23:00.720
It's for her!

23:03.400 --> 23:05.560
We will see now.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.960
We shall see
if the Gods chose right.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.840
You all right?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
About what you said earlier...

23:35.160 --> 23:36.760
To get this far,
you had to believe

23:36.800 --> 23:38.640
that you were the Chosen One.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.320
That everything you do
is the prophecy.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.320
But something different
must happen now.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.880
Imagine what you've been is...

23:48.920 --> 23:50.920
like a bell.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
You must become
the ring of the bell.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.960
Oh, yeah!

23:59.000 --> 24:01.480
The ring of the bell. Thanks.
That's done the trick.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.240
You have to release yourself
from everything.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.520
Take that step beyond.
How will I know I'm there?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.760
I've never done it.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.640
But these truths...
They come from the Gods.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.280
Oh, leave her alone, won't you?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.480
Was I speaking to you?
Get out of her ear for once.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.280
Give the girl some space
to think.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.680
Our faith, not yours maybe,
but ours...

24:26.720 --> 24:28.520
it keeps this land whole.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.960
It's hope in the darkness,
strength to the weak,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.200
and she is the one
who will carry us through.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.760
She is the one the Gods
-have chosen.
-No.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.440
No, no, no.
They didn't.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.320
They did.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.240
How would you of all people know?

24:45.280 --> 24:47.440
Because...

24:49.560 --> 24:52.080
I was a Chosen One, too.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.560
After my father died,
the druids came to choose

24:55.600 --> 24:59.480
who would lead the tribe.
The mighty Veran,

24:59.520 --> 25:03.000
not your Veran,
there's been plenty.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.680
This other Veran,

25:07.120 --> 25:09.200
he took quite a shine to me.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.960
I was 14.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.280
He walks straight past
my three older brothers

25:14.320 --> 25:17.080
and sat me on his lap
and said I was to be

25:17.120 --> 25:20.680
The Chosen One,
and Queen of my tribe.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.160
Promised to school me.

25:27.600 --> 25:32.280
He gave the schooling a good go.
Trust me.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.280
You say your faith springs
from the earth,

25:35.320 --> 25:38.000
the rivers, the trees.
It does not.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.640
It springs from mouths of men.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.400
From Verans.

25:43.440 --> 25:48.840
And every Veran only wants to be
feared, obeyed, worshipped.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.880
That young woman over there,
no Gods chose her.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.680
She's just a brave child.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.760
And she's called Cait.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.720
I was thinking,
if you and I both died out here,

26:39.760 --> 26:42.320
what would become of young Phelan?

26:44.800 --> 26:48.120
Sorry, not the sort of thought
you might have right now.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.200
I was rambling.

26:51.160 --> 26:55.280
You were worried about young Phelan.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.080
Yeah.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.080
All alone. No parents.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.720
What happened to his parents?

27:04.480 --> 27:06.480
Fair enough.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.680
Bit cold, but I don't blame you.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.240
I ran off so...

27:12.280 --> 27:15.720
Just thought we could be civil,
tonight being-

27:17.360 --> 27:19.960
Yeah, never mind.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.640
This is the real trial.
Isn't it?

27:51.600 --> 27:54.360
What?
One of them will betray you.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.600
It's me.
I chose everyone.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.080
And it's done for us.
I did that.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.960
So the one who betrays me, is me.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
You're right.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.680
We should give up. We've lost.

28:10.720 --> 28:15.720
-We've lost.
-You think so?
We've lost Big Pebble.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.520
It's a pebble.
You can find another.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.440
Have I taught you nothing?

28:24.480 --> 28:27.360
They've got us.
They're in amongst us right now.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.880
Right here.

28:28.920 --> 28:32.600
They're coming in ways
we cannot see. You know this!

28:32.640 --> 28:37.160
We can try and try, but
our prophecies are made for this.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.240
They've killed our Gods,
don't you see?

28:40.280 --> 28:42.280
So...

28:44.400 --> 28:47.240
You're all done.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.200
The first thing you said.

28:50.240 --> 28:54.760
You're wrong.
This isn't the real trial.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.680
The real trial is beyond
anything you fear now.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.560
It hasn't even begun.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.880
You all right?

29:15.720 --> 29:17.720
Lost.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.280
Hey! We need to talk.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.040
They'll be here soon.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.480
But you gotta go.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.600
Get back in line!

31:18.360 --> 31:21.000
They're here.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.160
They're here.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.600
Where's she?
Isn't she with you?

31:29.640 --> 31:31.320
What?

31:41.440 --> 31:44.560
Hold on. Stop.

31:44.600 --> 31:48.440
Halt. Stop.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.280
Light the torches.
Light the torches.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.200
Move on.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.000
We need to move.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.480
Halt.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.320
Wagons, stop!

32:17.360 --> 32:20.200
Fucking builders.
Clear the way.

32:31.720 --> 32:35.320
Hey, bring some in.
Through here.

32:35.360 --> 32:39.360
I want two teams on it,
clearing this path.

32:39.400 --> 32:43.600
Now move. Move.
Move, move, move.

32:51.240 --> 32:55.000
Uncouple the horses.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.280
Uncouple the horses!

32:59.920 --> 33:02.520
Bring the horses
in the front.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.960
Here!

33:13.600 --> 33:16.720
Hmm. It's a bit taller
from down here.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.800
Move it!

33:35.280 --> 33:37.480
Not tonight.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.520
Yeah, only if you put it out.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.480
Well, come out of there
and I'll piss on your leg.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.160
Hold it.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.080
-Have a reach.
-Nice.
My lovely baby's busy.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.480
Busier than you.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.000
Bring the horses
in the front.

34:14.040 --> 34:16.600
Listen closely.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.000
Are you listening?

34:23.440 --> 34:27.400
Lucius, it's me.
Let's get you out. Come on.

34:33.160 --> 34:35.080
Lucius...

34:36.200 --> 34:38.600
Oh, shit.

34:41.840 --> 34:45.720
Ah, mate.
That's not good, is it?

34:46.880 --> 34:49.480
Not having that.
Not on my watch.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.360
Um...

34:53.400 --> 34:55.440
Let me fix you up.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.880
Ahh.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.000
You know, I mean that bungled
murder attempt aside,

35:51.040 --> 35:53.640
you were the best Praefectus
I ever had.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.320
Maybe because of that,

35:57.360 --> 36:00.640
I wish my current Praefectus
could bludgeon anybody

36:00.680 --> 36:02.680
in their beds.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.440
You know, I lost my son.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.240
My little lad.

36:19.560 --> 36:23.040
You met him, didn't you?
You gave him that sword.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.400
Proper little scabbard,
the crests.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.240
He was only this big,
he could hardly lift it.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.920
He slept with it under his bed.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.920
I never told you that, did I?

36:39.960 --> 36:42.760
I should've told you
how much he loved it.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.720
Oh.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.720
Listen to me, I didn't get you
in here to bleed all over you.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.240
These things happen, now that
there's a war out there.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.440
We...

37:01.480 --> 37:05.480
we are the point
of the spear, aren't we?

37:06.600 --> 37:09.640
No good if we piss
and whine about it.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.800
Do you know
how much I admire you?

37:33.840 --> 37:36.080
Now I'm not stronger than you.
I'm not better than you.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.800
And I wear this uniform
to hide that.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.960
And you, you are a soldier
down to your bones.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.960
-Where are you taking me?
-They never
taught us how to surrender.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.400
Turns out it's quite a thing.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.520
Well, where are we going?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.880
Where you have always been going.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.000
Where I'm too weak to go.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.480
She was right about that.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.640
But she'll welcome you

38:03.680 --> 38:06.760
into her warm embrace.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.120
You never met my wife,
did you?

38:13.360 --> 38:15.680
Felt her love.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.120
It's a trap.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.640
Ania, follow me.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.920
Rest of you wait here.
I'm coming with you.

38:29.960 --> 38:34.400
No. I know what you want.
Just stay here.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.280
She brought him back to me.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.120
My son.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.480
He was as close to me
as you are now.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.080
No. No.
This is not right.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.120
Not now. Not now. Not now.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.920
He was... he was here.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.160
And I thought
it was a miracle.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.600
As perfect as I remember.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.320
Help me tie him down, quick.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.320
What is it?
It's his demon.

39:25.360 --> 39:29.280
It's coming out.
-Nah, fuck that.
-Quick.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.800
His beautiful eyes.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.640
And his golden hair.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.040
Screw this.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.600
Oh, what a gift.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.560
Spill the blood.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.600
Spill the blood.
Drink his love.

40:16.640 --> 40:20.720
Spill the blood.

41:02.520 --> 41:06.200
No! Don't! No!
I'm coming.
-No! Don't. Don't.
