03:53.776 --> 03:54.911
Good morning.

03:56.478 --> 03:57.479
Lovely day, is it not?

03:58.581 --> 03:59.649
What can I do for you?

04:01.884 --> 04:03.953
I know it's been quite some
time since you sold to anyone,

04:03.986 --> 04:05.822
or traded for that matter.

04:05.855 --> 04:06.756
I'm not selling.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.491
But how about a trade?

04:09.524 --> 04:10.993
I have some goods that
my wife put together.

04:11.027 --> 04:12.061
I can't spare it.

04:15.798 --> 04:17.432
You're not the
least bit curious?

04:18.935 --> 04:20.502
I don't need
anything from you.

04:23.606 --> 04:24.539
Please.

04:25.608 --> 04:26.541
I have a family.

04:30.613 --> 04:31.914
They're not my responsibility.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.860
You're very luck out here.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.429
So peaceful.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.466
Miles away from anyone.

04:55.037 --> 04:55.938
You should go.

05:02.444 --> 05:03.946
Perhaps I'll see
you again sometime.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.516
God bless.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.509
Who's that?

05:34.542 --> 05:35.978
He's a villain.

05:36.012 --> 05:37.445
Why?

05:37.479 --> 05:39.882
He steals girls like you,

05:39.916 --> 05:42.450
takes them away from
their mother forever.

05:42.484 --> 05:44.552
That's why they can
never know about you.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.794
Look how radiant you skin is.

06:28.998 --> 06:30.199
That feels good.

06:31.901 --> 06:33.501
The others will be so impressed.

06:51.754 --> 06:52.989
Why not help that man today?

06:56.659 --> 06:57.593
He's dangerous.

06:59.195 --> 07:00.495
Because he's desperate?

07:01.764 --> 07:02.798
He said he has a family.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.167
And if I helped him,
how could I refuse

07:05.201 --> 07:06.202
the next person, right?

07:07.770 --> 07:08.804
No exceptions.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.741
I suppose.

07:44.907 --> 07:45.841
Goodnight.

08:20.276 --> 08:22.244
These are dire times, indeed.

08:23.779 --> 08:26.849
To lose a life at
such a young age,

08:26.882 --> 08:30.186
is a tragedy no parent
should ever endure.

08:33.688 --> 08:34.924
Liam was my grandson,

08:34.957 --> 08:39.195
so this is an
especially hard day.

08:42.765 --> 08:45.768
But there is not a
single soul among us

08:48.437 --> 08:50.773
who could fathom
the depths of pain

08:50.806 --> 08:53.309
that the boys parents are
feeling at this very moment.

08:54.677 --> 08:55.611
Bridget,

08:57.012 --> 08:57.980
Colm, my son,

08:59.248 --> 09:01.050
I am so sorry for your loss.

09:03.152 --> 09:05.988
It might feel like this pain
will never pass, but it does.

09:07.223 --> 09:08.157
It will.

09:11.193 --> 09:13.295
And we will be here
for you both all of us.

09:19.001 --> 09:22.304
We will not allow
this time of darkness

09:23.973 --> 09:26.408
to extinguish the
everlasting light we have

09:27.810 --> 09:29.678
in our Lord Jesus Christ.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.115
Amen.

09:45.261 --> 09:47.229
How's your
William doing?

09:47.263 --> 09:49.198
No, Colm, don't.

09:49.231 --> 09:50.900
Colm.

09:50.933 --> 09:53.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stand.

09:53.202 --> 09:54.937
- Stand.
- Go home.

09:54.970 --> 09:55.938
- Forgive me.
- You must truly

09:55.971 --> 09:57.840
regard us as lower than dirt.

09:57.873 --> 09:59.175
- I beg your pardon.
- You see that?

09:59.208 --> 10:00.943
My wife and I buried
our son today.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.411
Well, then my
condolences to you both.

10:02.444 --> 10:05.314
You don't give a damn
about anybody at all!

10:05.347 --> 10:06.715
- Don't touch me.
- Or what?

10:07.983 --> 10:08.951
Or what, or what?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.319
Speak up, speak up!

10:11.453 --> 10:12.421
Speak up!

10:13.889 --> 10:15.357
You come through here
parading your abundance

10:15.391 --> 10:17.193
on the day of my son's funeral!

10:17.226 --> 10:18.861
I wasn't aware of the funeral.

10:18.894 --> 10:20.062
Flaunt it in front of
all these starving people!

10:20.095 --> 10:21.830
That was not my intent.

10:21.864 --> 10:23.032
We are the faithful ones.

10:23.065 --> 10:25.234
Yet, God smiles upon
you why is that?

10:25.267 --> 10:27.036
God's got nothing
to do with it.

10:28.904 --> 10:30.372
Everyone knows
what you are, Devil.

10:30.406 --> 10:32.374
Everyone knows what you are.

10:32.408 --> 10:34.043
- You creature.
- Please go!

10:34.076 --> 10:35.244
- Everyone knows.
- Keep away from there!

10:35.277 --> 10:36.812
Keep them, get away!

10:36.845 --> 10:38.247
Get away all of you!

10:38.280 --> 10:41.217
Get away, get away, get away!

10:41.250 --> 10:42.985
Get off, get off there!

10:43.018 --> 10:44.954
- Get off there!
- That's enough!

10:44.987 --> 10:46.755
Return those to Miss Earnshaw.

10:54.463 --> 10:55.931
Are you all right?

10:57.333 --> 10:58.234
Thank you.

11:12.915 --> 11:15.517
You heard
what the man said?

15:12.387 --> 15:13.690
Colm Dwyer?

15:13.723 --> 15:16.225
He cursed her out
then he hit her.

15:16.258 --> 15:17.292
Despicable.

15:19.361 --> 15:20.262
I want to help.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.266
Make him regret it.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.768
He deserves it.

15:25.802 --> 15:27.035
But keep it secret.

15:30.372 --> 15:31.306
I wouldn't know how.

15:33.108 --> 15:34.076
Well, Darling,
what you have to do

15:34.109 --> 15:36.211
is you go to Colm's house,

15:36.245 --> 15:38.146
and you get something
from his son.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.314
We'll use it in the ingathering

15:39.348 --> 15:41.450
for our little
ceremony, all right.

15:42.518 --> 15:44.119
Don't tell your mom.

15:49.659 --> 15:50.559
Thank you.

15:58.835 --> 16:00.269
What was that all about?

16:00.302 --> 16:01.236
Nothing.

16:04.406 --> 16:05.307
Come on, let's go.

16:24.627 --> 16:27.162
- What is it?
- I have to pee.

16:46.348 --> 16:49.284
Hurry up or you'll have to
hold it the rest of the way.

16:49.318 --> 16:51.320
Otherwise you'll force
me back into the box?

16:51.353 --> 16:52.254
That's right.

16:53.856 --> 16:56.291
Would you say that to me
if I was the man who hit you?

16:58.861 --> 17:00.295
What do you want?

17:00.329 --> 17:02.431
I want to help, I'm ready.

17:02.464 --> 17:03.666
This is not the time
for that conversation...

17:03.700 --> 17:06.401
Both of those men threatened
you because they're unlucky.

17:06.435 --> 17:07.469
They think you're the villain.

17:07.502 --> 17:09.906
Who do you trust, them or me?

17:14.944 --> 17:16.679
Pardon my intrusion.

17:24.286 --> 17:25.588
It's Mr. Buckley, isn't it?

17:27.222 --> 17:28.156
Yes.

17:37.834 --> 17:38.768
Here.

17:41.303 --> 17:42.537
Here please take this.

17:44.607 --> 17:45.708
Uh.

17:47.744 --> 17:50.847
Please, sir, this
does not concern you.

17:54.549 --> 17:56.184
You're welcome to it all.

17:57.787 --> 17:59.789
What, everything?

17:59.822 --> 18:00.757
Everything.

18:07.930 --> 18:10.465
Just as long as you forget
what you have seen here today.

18:15.838 --> 18:17.406
It's settled then.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.611
Please, sir, this is
not as it appears.

18:22.912 --> 18:25.547
Oh, no, what is
it then, exactly?

18:27.549 --> 18:29.619
Sir, please take it.

18:29.652 --> 18:30.552
Let us be.

18:31.888 --> 18:32.822
Please.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.294
Here.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.495
No, no, that's enough.

18:40.529 --> 18:41.563
No.

18:41.597 --> 18:43.265
No, no that's enough I said!

18:44.332 --> 18:45.267
Goddamn you.

18:49.471 --> 18:50.372
I never seen you.

18:51.473 --> 18:53.475
Thank you.

18:54.977 --> 18:55.912
Thank you.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.299
He'll talk.

19:18.467 --> 19:21.536
No matter his
promises, it'll spread.

19:23.305 --> 19:24.841
That's how it works
with these people.

19:35.618 --> 19:36.551
Audrey?

19:37.887 --> 19:38.821
Audrey?

19:42.091 --> 19:43.025
Audrey?

19:44.359 --> 19:45.360
Audrey?

21:59.061 --> 22:00.596
Listen.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.198
I got you, Love.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.009
You're safe now.

22:13.042 --> 22:14.777
Come here.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.012
Now watch.

22:16.045 --> 22:16.979
You.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.184
Okay.

22:59.922 --> 23:00.923
Bridget, love.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.829
Bridget.

23:15.871 --> 23:17.239
Goodnight then.

23:29.251 --> 23:31.654
We must keep our voices low.

23:32.788 --> 23:34.957
My wife she's asleep upstairs.

23:34.991 --> 23:35.891
Your wife?

23:36.959 --> 23:38.127
Yeah.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.062
- Bridget.
- Bridget?

23:44.767 --> 23:45.668
What's your name?

23:46.936 --> 23:48.270
I'm Colm Dwyer.

23:50.039 --> 23:50.973
And you?

23:52.274 --> 23:53.209
Audrey.

23:54.276 --> 23:55.211
Audrey.

23:57.813 --> 23:59.982
What were you doing out there?

24:02.785 --> 24:03.686
Who's Liam?

24:06.022 --> 24:06.956
Our son.

24:13.129 --> 24:14.897
What age is he?

24:17.033 --> 24:17.967
He.

24:20.302 --> 24:21.237
Passed.

24:24.607 --> 24:25.775
What happened?

24:27.043 --> 24:27.977
Fell ill.

24:31.947 --> 24:33.616
It was his breathing.

24:35.951 --> 24:37.787
The funeral must
have been very hard for you.

24:39.288 --> 24:40.856
That's how we'll be known now,

24:43.225 --> 24:44.794
the parents who
lost their child.

24:47.797 --> 24:48.764
It'll be our legacy.

24:48.798 --> 24:49.698
Your legacy?

24:51.167 --> 24:53.669
Perhaps it's strange
for me to put it that way.

24:56.872 --> 24:59.742
Maybe not, I don't know.

24:59.775 --> 25:00.943
At least you
still have Bridget.

25:04.346 --> 25:06.315
I don't know what I'd
do if I lost her too.

25:10.252 --> 25:11.353
Why were you out there?

25:13.255 --> 25:15.024
Where'd you come from?

25:22.098 --> 25:23.666
Right.

25:23.699 --> 25:24.633
It's late.

25:27.236 --> 25:29.371
You can sleep there tonight.

25:35.010 --> 25:35.945
Colm.

25:37.113 --> 25:38.047
Yes.

25:47.690 --> 25:49.091
Thank you for letting me in.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.135
Goodnight then.

26:34.203 --> 26:35.137
Bridget.

26:40.776 --> 26:41.777
Bridget.

26:50.953 --> 26:51.887
Bridget.

27:01.330 --> 27:02.264
Bridget.

27:15.110 --> 27:16.045
Bridget.

27:21.517 --> 27:22.451
Bridget.

27:24.086 --> 27:25.020
Bridget.

27:26.088 --> 27:27.022
Bridget.

27:28.090 --> 27:29.024
Bridget.

27:30.092 --> 27:31.026
Bridget.

27:32.094 --> 27:33.329
Bridget.

27:33.362 --> 27:34.863
Bridget.

27:34.897 --> 27:35.831
Bridget.

27:37.333 --> 27:38.434
Bridget.

27:38.467 --> 27:39.535
Bridget.

27:39.568 --> 27:40.869
Bridget.

27:40.903 --> 27:42.204
Bridget.

27:42.238 --> 27:43.872
Bridget.

27:43.906 --> 27:45.074
Bridget.

27:45.107 --> 27:46.242
Bridget.

27:46.275 --> 27:47.476
Bridget.

27:47.509 --> 27:48.844
Bridget.

27:48.877 --> 27:49.945
Bridget.

28:55.044 --> 28:58.847
What the bloody
hell is wrong with her?

29:00.149 --> 29:02.418
And how
was she afterwards?

29:02.451 --> 29:05.487
Oh, she fell to sleep
once I had her back inside.

29:05.521 --> 29:06.955
You know how she is.

29:06.989 --> 29:08.524
She's always been
a tad agitated.

29:08.557 --> 29:09.858
Good morning.

29:09.892 --> 29:11.327
Bridget, love.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.362
Of course I've been agitated.

29:13.395 --> 29:14.863
He was our little boy.

29:16.298 --> 29:18.133
I'll step out for a moment.

29:23.906 --> 29:24.907
Why'd you do it?

29:29.646 --> 29:33.148
Why not ask Burke if you
wish to discuss my well being.

29:33.182 --> 29:34.483
I brought him here
to come and help you.

29:34.516 --> 29:36.218
You're not helping me!

29:36.251 --> 29:37.286
It wasn't normal what you...

29:40.089 --> 29:41.056
God.

29:42.257 --> 29:43.192
Bridget?

29:44.993 --> 29:45.928
Okay?

29:48.230 --> 29:49.398
Eh, Burke!

29:49.431 --> 29:50.366
Burke!

30:05.347 --> 30:06.348
Where were you?

30:06.382 --> 30:08.417
- Nowhere.
- Don't do that.

30:08.450 --> 30:09.686
We don't do that to each other.

30:09.719 --> 30:11.621
- What?
- Where did you go?

30:11.654 --> 30:12.655
I took a walk.

30:12.689 --> 30:13.922
To the Dwyer's house.

30:13.956 --> 30:14.957
What, no.

30:14.990 --> 30:16.024
I heard you yesterday.

30:16.058 --> 30:17.926
You spoke of him.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.129
I said you were attacked
and took it like a dog.

30:37.747 --> 30:39.616
How long have you
been feeling this way?

30:41.116 --> 30:42.585
Not long.

30:42.619 --> 30:44.319
And have you
noticed anything else

30:44.353 --> 30:45.921
that's at all out
of the ordinary?

30:48.591 --> 30:49.491
I don't believe so.

30:52.327 --> 30:54.396
I'm sure it's been a
difficult time for you both,

30:54.430 --> 30:56.365
so it does make sense
that you've missed this.

30:56.398 --> 30:57.332
But,

31:00.068 --> 31:01.403
you're with child.

31:01.437 --> 31:02.571
With child?

31:04.674 --> 31:06.375
It wasn't like this with Liam.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.344
It felt different.

31:10.512 --> 31:12.548
Every pregnancy is different.

31:12.582 --> 31:14.516
It's the reason for
your unusual cravings.

31:15.752 --> 31:17.419
Stick to proper food,

31:17.453 --> 31:20.456
and have a cup of tea if
you have any other urgings.

31:20.489 --> 31:24.126
But I'll come back in a week
or so, and we can talk more.

31:26.061 --> 31:26.962
I'll see myself out.

31:29.064 --> 31:29.965
Goodbye, Burke.

31:33.302 --> 31:34.236
I mean it.

31:36.104 --> 31:38.040
Something feels off.

31:38.073 --> 31:39.975
That's
just shock of it all.

31:41.477 --> 31:42.544
We'll take it day-by-day.

31:43.646 --> 31:44.647
Come here, Love.

31:46.515 --> 31:47.549
It'll be okay.

31:49.384 --> 31:50.620
It'll be okay.

32:09.238 --> 32:10.138
This one's done.

32:16.311 --> 32:17.446
What do you see out there?

32:19.682 --> 32:20.683
It's getting colder.

32:22.785 --> 32:24.587
All the more reason
for us to make haste.

32:26.221 --> 32:27.523
Hand me another.

32:34.631 --> 32:35.798
Christ, Audrey!

32:44.339 --> 32:46.676
I know it's all been
for my protection,

32:46.709 --> 32:47.710
everything you've done.

32:49.579 --> 32:50.479
I've tried.

32:52.414 --> 32:54.082
I know.

32:54.116 --> 32:55.484
But you need to
trust me now too.

32:57.252 --> 32:58.253
I'm ready.

33:00.289 --> 33:01.691
If that's the case,
then you'll understand

33:01.724 --> 33:03.525
the importance of sacrifice.

33:07.664 --> 33:08.564
Let me see.

33:10.432 --> 33:11.433
Mm.

33:16.706 --> 33:17.640
No.

33:32.755 --> 33:34.489
What happened here?

33:34.523 --> 33:36.626
I cannot say for certain.

33:42.732 --> 33:43.800
Fettered from the inside.

33:47.202 --> 33:48.705
It's not good.

33:48.738 --> 33:49.772
It's not good.

33:52.240 --> 33:55.243
Yeah, Lochlan's horses he's
sentimental about these things.

33:55.277 --> 33:57.512
They're not supposed
to cross species.

33:59.649 --> 34:01.383
How's our girl keeping?

34:01.416 --> 34:02.885
Oh, she's good, she's healthy.

34:07.857 --> 34:09.424
Aren't you girl?

34:10.893 --> 34:14.396
You best keep her separate
till the slaughter.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.364
Mm.

34:29.712 --> 34:30.713
What, what's wrong?

34:30.746 --> 34:31.914
- Perfectly good.
- No good.

34:33.248 --> 34:34.248
No good.

34:53.936 --> 34:57.439
Bless us, O' Lord,
with these thy gifts

34:57.472 --> 35:01.476
which we're about to
receive from thy bounty

35:02.612 --> 35:05.247
through Christ, our Lord, amen.

35:06.314 --> 35:07.249
Amen.

35:09.551 --> 35:10.485
Amen.

35:17.392 --> 35:19.361
Where did this come from?

35:21.363 --> 35:23.565
Eat up before it gets cold.

35:27.436 --> 35:28.370
Mm.

35:39.582 --> 35:40.515
Mm-mm.

36:13.750 --> 36:14.684
Mm.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.705
Come now, Mauve.

36:54.123 --> 36:55.057
Is everything all right?

36:55.091 --> 36:56.626
What?

36:56.659 --> 36:57.593
No, no.

37:00.428 --> 37:01.329
What is it?

37:02.899 --> 37:04.533
I know Bernard better
than he knows himself.

37:04.566 --> 37:05.635
There's something wrong.

37:07.136 --> 37:08.570
Ten days ago now he came home

37:08.604 --> 37:09.972
with some fresh milk and bread.

37:10.006 --> 37:11.107
Where would he get that from?

37:11.140 --> 37:12.041
He wouldn't say
where he'd found it.

37:12.074 --> 37:13.009
That can't be all.

37:16.012 --> 37:18.413
He's been fondling himself.

37:18.446 --> 37:19.481
I caught him in the act.

37:21.416 --> 37:24.486
There's something
wrong with him.

37:24.519 --> 37:26.088
This deep sadness
I can't help him.

37:26.122 --> 37:27.455
Please, Seamus.

37:31.627 --> 37:32.995
Give us a minute.

37:44.106 --> 37:45.041
May I?

37:49.045 --> 37:50.780
It's not as she
tells it, not at all.

37:53.850 --> 37:56.586
Why don't you take
it from the beginning.

37:56.619 --> 37:57.552
What brought this on.

38:00.488 --> 38:02.959
Well, you remember
how Claudia Baron died?

38:02.992 --> 38:06.829
How she grew so sick
and with the nightmares,

38:06.863 --> 38:08.898
and she blamed it
on Agatha Earnshaw.

38:08.931 --> 38:10.099
Of course.

38:10.132 --> 38:12.702
That she had a
daughter, Agatha did,

38:12.735 --> 38:14.737
a daughter that no one
had ever seen before.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.571
I questioned Agatha myself.

38:17.940 --> 38:22.044
That poor girl
withered away terrified,

38:22.078 --> 38:24.113
and not one soul
of us believed her.

38:24.146 --> 38:25.081
Well, I do.

38:26.148 --> 38:27.083
I do.

38:28.885 --> 38:31.486
Well, no, don't tell
Deirdre for God sake.

38:31.519 --> 38:32.420
Promise me that.

38:34.522 --> 38:35.825
What happened, exactly?

38:37.093 --> 38:39.862
Well, I was coming
home from a job,

38:39.896 --> 38:42.965
and it was the day
after Liam's funeral.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.035
And I passed them on the road.

38:46.068 --> 38:47.603
And I had words with Agatha.

38:48.838 --> 38:51.473
And then I seen her.

38:51.506 --> 38:52.942
I seen her.

38:52.975 --> 38:54.143
She could have
been an acquaintance?

38:54.176 --> 38:56.579
It was her
daughter I know that.

38:56.612 --> 38:58.446
I know that from the
moment I saw her,

38:58.480 --> 39:00.216
and from that same moment
when she looked at me,

39:00.249 --> 39:02.450
I had a feeling that
I never had before.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.621
Suddenly empty.

39:08.090 --> 39:09.557
What are you saying?

39:09.592 --> 39:14.130
I don't think I can
go on living like I was.

39:16.799 --> 39:17.733
Not now.

39:20.069 --> 39:23.839
She was the most
beautiful creature

39:23.873 --> 39:25.608
I've ever laid eyes upon.

39:31.647 --> 39:32.882
It's just the wind.

39:36.218 --> 39:37.153
Yes.

39:41.958 --> 39:44.593
What would
you do if he came back?

39:44.627 --> 39:46.528
Well,
I'd protect you.

39:46.561 --> 39:48.631
But what if it was the
Dwyer man from the funeral?

39:48.664 --> 39:50.199
Oh, that
wouldn't change anything.

39:50.232 --> 39:52.768
- But at the funeral...
- That was different.

39:52.802 --> 39:53.803
There was a crowd.

39:53.836 --> 39:54.704
You were in the cart.

40:02.712 --> 40:03.746
What's you legacy?

40:06.048 --> 40:07.650
Well, I'd say you are.

40:10.186 --> 40:11.954
Is one's legacy
always their child?

40:13.656 --> 40:15.091
No, sometimes it can be

40:15.124 --> 40:16.826
if someone does
something important.

40:21.263 --> 40:24.200
Then perhaps one's legacy
is how people remember you.

40:24.233 --> 40:25.567
Possibly, yes.

40:28.337 --> 40:29.939
And that could mean sacrifice?

40:31.007 --> 40:31.941
Maybe.

40:34.610 --> 40:36.746
Does that mean you'd
sacrifice yourself for me?

41:02.271 --> 41:03.973
What?

41:04.006 --> 41:06.075
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

41:06.108 --> 41:07.643
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

41:07.676 --> 41:08.911
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

41:09.979 --> 41:11.313
Get in!

41:17.019 --> 41:19.055
No, let me out!

41:20.289 --> 41:21.724
Get me out!

41:21.757 --> 41:23.759
I want out!

41:49.819 --> 41:50.753
Hello?

41:56.058 --> 41:56.992
Lochlan?

41:59.228 --> 42:00.162
Mary?

42:10.906 --> 42:11.841
Hello?

42:12.908 --> 42:13.909
Hello?

42:20.249 --> 42:21.183
God.

43:22.778 --> 43:23.946
We need to talk.

43:26.348 --> 43:29.251
We need to speak, Seamus.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.322
We need to have words.

43:35.491 --> 43:36.859
It's not normal.

43:38.761 --> 43:39.929
It's not normal.

43:45.968 --> 43:47.736
One, two good luck..

43:50.339 --> 43:53.175
We're going to be late.

43:53.209 --> 43:54.243
I'm coming!

44:05.120 --> 44:09.892
♪ Savior from all of our fears ♪

44:14.797 --> 44:19.401
♪ May angels guard
us while we sleep ♪

44:22.471 --> 44:26.141
♪ Till morning light appears ♪

44:34.383 --> 44:35.251
You may be seated.

44:40.189 --> 44:42.091
Before we get to today's sermon,

44:43.892 --> 44:45.227
I'd like to make
an announcement.

44:47.363 --> 44:50.232
Colm and Bridget are
expecting a child.

44:57.273 --> 45:01.010
I thought we should start with
a short verse from I John,

45:01.043 --> 45:03.178
chapter four verse one.

45:03.212 --> 45:07.349
"We love because
he first loved us."

45:07.383 --> 45:09.118
Short and simple,

45:09.151 --> 45:10.886
- but perhaps something...
- That's enough!

45:12.354 --> 45:14.089
How?

45:14.123 --> 45:15.424
How can you keep
saying these things

45:15.457 --> 45:17.326
and maintain a straight face?

45:17.359 --> 45:19.094
- Pardon me?
- We love.

45:19.128 --> 45:21.397
We love because
God loved us first.

45:21.430 --> 45:22.364
Is that it?

45:23.465 --> 45:24.900
It's not merely a lie.

45:24.933 --> 45:26.603
It's a great load of horse shit.

45:26.636 --> 45:27.936
You best
mind that language.

45:27.970 --> 45:29.571
No, no we're gonna
talk right now!

45:30.939 --> 45:33.108
Failed crops, sickly children,

45:34.443 --> 45:37.513
how much graver must
our circumstance become?

45:37.546 --> 45:41.517
A calf was born with
two bloody heads,

45:41.550 --> 45:45.054
and not one person
uttered a word.

45:45.087 --> 45:48.591
We're bedeviled by something
unnatural out there.

45:48.625 --> 45:50.926
And what are we doing?

45:52.061 --> 45:52.961
It's not normal.

45:54.063 --> 45:55.197
This is not normal!

45:55.230 --> 45:57.399
I'm well aware of how perverse

45:57.433 --> 46:00.202
- these tragedies have become!
- These tragedy is

46:00.235 --> 46:02.338
that we've become so complacent.

46:02.371 --> 46:04.139
We just bend over and take it.

46:04.173 --> 46:06.241
There's a
difference between complacency,

46:06.275 --> 46:07.543
and maintaining one's faith...

46:07.576 --> 46:09.111
- Faith!
- in the face of...

46:09.144 --> 46:10.479
This is not about faith!

46:12.348 --> 46:13.148
Bernard, what's going on?

46:13.182 --> 46:15.652
- Shut up!
- Put it down, Bernard.

46:15.685 --> 46:18.854
I only wish you knew
what I felt with her.

46:20.089 --> 46:21.890
I truly do.

46:21.924 --> 46:25.394
It's a strange comfort to know

46:25.427 --> 46:28.997
how truly insignificant you are.

46:29.031 --> 46:30.966
- We can talk.
- Bernard, stop.

46:32.134 --> 46:34.036
Let's step outside.

46:34.069 --> 46:36.171
- No, no!
- No, no, no, no, no, don't!

47:15.577 --> 47:17.146
What do you want?

47:20.683 --> 47:22.484
I can't be seen.

47:22.518 --> 47:23.419
Get inside.

47:51.447 --> 47:52.414
Hello?

47:53.750 --> 47:55.017
Anybody in there?

47:59.656 --> 48:01.423
What
happened to your family?

48:05.662 --> 48:07.329
We just couldn't
survive anymore.

48:09.431 --> 48:10.365
I had to do it.

48:16.238 --> 48:17.139
How do you do it?

48:18.207 --> 48:19.709
Do what?

48:19.742 --> 48:22.144
You have the only farm
producing for miles.

48:23.780 --> 48:25.481
I don't know.

48:25.514 --> 48:26.716
That's not what I've heard.

48:28.116 --> 48:29.418
What have you heard?

48:31.220 --> 48:32.689
They think it's
your heathen ways.

48:34.223 --> 48:36.158
A pact with the devil
for all that out there.

48:38.828 --> 48:40.429
Silly superstitions, I suppose.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.603
All ye had to do was
help me that day,

48:46.636 --> 48:47.704
and they'd still be here.

48:49.438 --> 48:51.039
I know you chose to insult me.

48:52.541 --> 48:53.710
I'm sorry.

48:53.743 --> 48:55.678
You knew
I was desperate.

48:57.446 --> 48:58.514
I don't want any trouble.

49:00.249 --> 49:01.183
Don't speak.

49:04.854 --> 49:08.557
Now I'm gonna take as much
as I can carry then leave.

49:08.591 --> 49:10.526
If you mention this to anyone,
I'll come back for you.

49:10.559 --> 49:13.095
I swear to fucking God I will.

49:13.128 --> 49:14.029
Do you understand?

49:18.300 --> 49:19.234
Very good.

49:20.302 --> 49:21.470
Very good.

49:50.465 --> 49:51.834
We can handle this.

49:51.868 --> 49:53.302
Well, I
could've handled it myself.

49:53.335 --> 49:54.804
He had you against the wall!

49:54.837 --> 49:56.305
He was a villain
just like you've said

49:56.338 --> 49:57.607
- about everyone!
- That's enough!

49:57.640 --> 49:58.875
They think you're weak.

49:58.908 --> 50:00.342
- And they're right!
- Watch your mouth!

50:04.781 --> 50:06.548
They will come looking for him,

50:06.583 --> 50:08.383
and sooner or later
they will find him.

50:10.485 --> 50:11.386
I saved your life.

50:15.758 --> 50:18.661
I was a fool to
think I could be the mother.

50:20.295 --> 50:21.229
Come on.

51:12.649 --> 51:14.282
What's wrong?

51:14.316 --> 51:15.818
Look.

51:15.852 --> 51:17.419
When'd that happen?

51:17.452 --> 51:18.821
I was brushing my teeth.

51:18.855 --> 51:20.690
- Let me see.
- No.

51:20.723 --> 51:21.858
- Come on let me see.
- No!

51:23.325 --> 51:24.694
I need to tell you something.

51:28.865 --> 51:30.399
I can't have this baby.

51:31.466 --> 51:32.501
What?

51:34.269 --> 51:36.606
There are ways to end a pregnancy
before it comes to term.

51:38.440 --> 51:39.909
Remedies and such.

51:39.942 --> 51:40.943
There's no way!

51:40.977 --> 51:42.544
You want to kill our child!

51:42.577 --> 51:43.680
- Colm.
- I won't allow it.

51:43.713 --> 51:44.714
- Colm, wait!
- I won't allow it!

51:44.747 --> 51:45.682
Wait!

51:46.783 --> 51:47.684
Colm, wait.

51:48.951 --> 51:49.986
No wait.

51:50.019 --> 51:52.454
Stop, listen to me I'm sorry.

51:52.487 --> 51:53.756
I wasn't aware.

51:53.790 --> 51:55.357
- You weren't aware!
- I wasn't aware!

51:55.390 --> 51:56.659
- Don't fucking touch me!
- I'm sorry please.

51:56.693 --> 51:58.795
You weren't aware
that I'd be disgusted

51:58.828 --> 52:01.229
by such a heinous proposal.

52:01.263 --> 52:03.331
The soil's not yet
settled on Liam's grave,

52:03.365 --> 52:04.801
and you're ready
to bury another!

52:04.834 --> 52:06.334
I'm sorry.

52:06.368 --> 52:07.302
- Don't touch me.
- Please don't go.

52:08.604 --> 52:09.605
Where are you going.

52:09.639 --> 52:10.907
Anywhere away from you.

52:10.940 --> 52:12.709
But you can't go, please.

52:12.742 --> 52:14.877
Please don't leave me.

52:14.911 --> 52:17.680
I can't be alone right now.

52:17.714 --> 52:18.648
Colm!

52:20.415 --> 52:21.684
Please!

53:13.936 --> 53:15.303
Come here, love.

53:37.492 --> 53:38.426
Deirdre.

53:49.939 --> 53:51.874
What did
Bernard say to you that day?

53:54.043 --> 53:55.778
- You know I can't.
- What was it?

53:57.680 --> 53:59.115
I just can't.

53:59.148 --> 54:00.783
Look something pushed
him over the edge,

54:00.817 --> 54:02.450
and I have a right to
know what that was.

54:02.484 --> 54:04.854
Look I understand
your confusion.

54:04.887 --> 54:06.454
Is there someone else?

54:06.488 --> 54:07.690
It wasn't anything like that.

54:07.723 --> 54:09.792
"What I felt with her,"

54:09.826 --> 54:11.961
he obviously wasn't
referring to me.

54:11.994 --> 54:13.729
Trust me, I'm working on it.

54:13.763 --> 54:15.497
Have you sent for help?

54:15.530 --> 54:17.432
There has to be
an investigation.

54:17.465 --> 54:19.534
- What help?
- From the cities.

54:19.568 --> 54:21.804
They can deduce his
reasoning with science.

54:21.838 --> 54:23.906
You know Bernard was
your brother-in-law.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.908
He's not just another
entry in your catalog.

54:27.576 --> 54:29.444
You want to know what
Bernard said to me?

54:34.016 --> 54:36.786
He claimed to have seen the
daughter of Agatha Earnshaw.

54:38.520 --> 54:39.789
What if he did?

54:39.822 --> 54:40.857
Have you spoken to Agatha?

54:40.890 --> 54:43.025
This requires tact.

54:43.059 --> 54:44.526
Bernard killed himself.

54:45.628 --> 54:46.596
Deirdre, please.

54:47.763 --> 54:49.765
Trust me to do the right thing.

54:49.799 --> 54:51.601
You'd better.

54:51.634 --> 54:53.669
We all deserve better than this.

54:53.703 --> 54:56.105
Bernard deserves
better than this.

55:41.918 --> 55:43.853
Hello, Agatha.

55:46.756 --> 55:48.691
May I come in?

55:48.724 --> 55:49.625
What's this about?

55:52.695 --> 55:53.796
It's important.

55:55.264 --> 55:56.165
I'll make it brief.

56:22.591 --> 56:23.491
What is it?

56:25.995 --> 56:27.129
I know it's strange,

56:28.864 --> 56:30.498
my being here.

56:30.532 --> 56:31.233
Yes.

56:34.670 --> 56:36.639
A man from my
congregation passed.

56:39.075 --> 56:40.176
It was a suicide.

56:41.744 --> 56:43.511
Oh.

56:43.545 --> 56:45.781
It happened during service
in front of everyone.

56:48.985 --> 56:51.053
He had come to me a few
weeks prior he said...

56:54.123 --> 56:56.558
He said he had seen
you and another,

56:59.962 --> 57:01.864
a girl he believed
to be your daughter.

57:01.897 --> 57:03.565
I've heard this rumor before.

57:03.599 --> 57:04.834
I remember,
but this is not...

57:04.867 --> 57:07.169
No, you don't get to
do this to me again.

57:07.203 --> 57:08.204
No.

57:09.672 --> 57:11.674
It's only due diligence
for his widow's sake.

57:12.808 --> 57:15.277
He referenced her, this girl,

57:15.311 --> 57:16.946
before he pulled the trigger.

57:16.979 --> 57:18.914
Your man was sick in the head.

57:18.948 --> 57:20.816
I will to be held accountable.

57:30.059 --> 57:31.293
Have you had another threat?

57:33.329 --> 57:34.630
Uh, no, why?

57:36.032 --> 57:36.966
There's another man.

57:38.067 --> 57:39.101
Poisoned his family.

57:40.236 --> 57:41.170
Just.

57:42.905 --> 57:44.572
Just be careful.

58:03.392 --> 58:04.860
Mr. Buckley killed himself.

58:06.962 --> 58:08.230
He saw something in you.

58:20.643 --> 58:21.343
Bridget.

58:23.913 --> 58:25.681
Bridget.

58:25.714 --> 58:26.816
Bridget, love.

58:26.849 --> 58:28.017
Bridget!

58:28.050 --> 58:29.218
Bridget, love.

58:29.251 --> 58:30.252
Bridget!

58:30.286 --> 58:31.220
Bridget.

58:41.831 --> 58:43.199
What are you doing?

58:45.401 --> 58:47.136
What are you doing?

58:49.805 --> 58:50.739
Shh.

58:51.974 --> 58:53.375
You'll wake him.

01:00:13.923 --> 01:00:14.924
What is this?

01:00:14.957 --> 01:00:15.858
We're leaving.

01:00:20.963 --> 01:00:22.298
I told you word would spread.

01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:23.899
Seamus wasn't
looking for the man.

01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:25.801
About you, Audrey.

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:26.969
And, yes, sooner or later,

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:27.937
they'll come looking
for the body.

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.205
I can handle it if they do.

01:00:29.238 --> 01:00:30.973
It's too much.

01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:33.008
This is our home.

01:00:33.042 --> 01:00:34.877
We're going, at
least for a while.

01:00:39.782 --> 01:00:41.150
I'm not going anywhere.

01:00:47.156 --> 01:00:48.824
This isn't up for negotiation.

01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:51.193
Do you hear me?

01:00:58.434 --> 01:01:00.502
I can't believe
how weak you are!

01:01:00.536 --> 01:01:02.137
It's sickening!

01:01:02.171 --> 01:01:03.339
You'd let them walk all over you

01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:04.940
before standing your ground!

01:01:06.408 --> 01:01:08.077
What happened
to my sweet child?

01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:11.313
One of us has to do something.

01:01:38.907 --> 01:01:39.842
Audrey.

01:01:40.976 --> 01:01:42.311
Audrey, stop it?

01:01:42.344 --> 01:01:43.412
Stop it, that's enough.

01:01:43.445 --> 01:01:44.346
That's enough!

01:01:47.283 --> 01:01:48.317
You've made your point.

01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:48.270
Bridget!

01:03:51.573 --> 01:03:52.508
Bridget!

01:04:03.653 --> 01:04:04.587
Bridget?

01:04:11.628 --> 01:04:14.463
Bridget, what have you done?

01:04:14.496 --> 01:04:15.431
Huh?

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.304
You didn't.

01:04:27.476 --> 01:04:29.044
What have you done?

01:04:30.212 --> 01:04:31.581
What have you done?

01:04:35.317 --> 01:04:36.218
Okay, okay.

01:04:52.067 --> 01:04:54.503
Just a wee while longer,

01:04:54.536 --> 01:04:55.437
and we'll be done.

01:04:57.072 --> 01:04:58.140
Will she be well?

01:04:58.173 --> 01:04:59.575
Yes,

01:04:59.609 --> 01:05:01.376
but she'll need
to be very careful

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.679
while the stitches are in.

01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:05.013
And the child?

01:05:06.148 --> 01:05:07.282
She was very lucky.

01:05:24.233 --> 01:05:25.133
What's this?

01:05:26.468 --> 01:05:28.771
No, you don't have to do this.

01:05:28.805 --> 01:05:30.773
No, Burke, I swear I'll be
fine, no, don't do this.

01:05:30.807 --> 01:05:31.741
It's for your own good, Love.

01:05:31.774 --> 01:05:33.408
Colm, please don't.

01:05:33.442 --> 01:05:34.543
Promise I don't need this.

01:05:34.576 --> 01:05:36.746
Please, God, please don't.

01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:38.347
I'm sure it's for
your own good, Love.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.049
Colm, please don't
just stand there!

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:43.252
I promise I don't
need this, Colm.

01:05:43.285 --> 01:05:45.588
It's only to calm
your nerves, Bridget.

01:05:45.622 --> 01:05:47.556
Please don't.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.815
Where are you going?

01:06:14.116 --> 01:06:15.050
To the others.

01:06:17.352 --> 01:06:19.054
They deserve to know
what's happened.

01:06:20.422 --> 01:06:22.157
At least they haven't
forgotten why I'm here.

01:06:28.898 --> 01:06:32.267
You'll need to keep here in
there for at least a few days.

01:06:35.404 --> 01:06:37.372
What the bloody hell
is wrong with her?

01:06:37.406 --> 01:06:38.307
I don't know.

01:06:39.474 --> 01:06:40.710
- Her temperature...
- That was not

01:06:40.743 --> 01:06:42.110
her temperature!

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.715
She's gone stark-raving mad.

01:06:51.621 --> 01:06:53.422
Her heart is racing!

01:06:53.455 --> 01:06:54.356
Bridget, breathe!

01:06:56.258 --> 01:06:58.226
You need to calm down now!

01:07:21.784 --> 01:07:23.452
Well, think, damn you!

01:07:24.721 --> 01:07:25.788
That's not grieving
what she's done.

01:07:25.822 --> 01:07:27.590
What do you want me to say?

01:07:27.624 --> 01:07:28.925
She's been acting
strange for days

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:30.760
since before we knew
she was carrying child.

01:07:30.793 --> 01:07:32.394
That's all I thought it was.

01:07:36.866 --> 01:07:38.433
Everything changed after Liam.

01:07:43.505 --> 01:07:45.474
It's been a rash of
awful business lately.

01:07:46.776 --> 01:07:47.710
Liam,

01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:49.712
now this,

01:07:50.847 --> 01:07:52.514
Lochlan and his family.

01:07:59.656 --> 01:08:00.590
Bernard.

01:08:02.424 --> 01:08:03.325
What about Bernard?

01:08:04.927 --> 01:08:06.596
You're not to utter
a word of this to anyone.

01:08:07.664 --> 01:08:08.965
Of course.

01:08:08.998 --> 01:08:11.199
He swore to me that he'd seen

01:08:11.233 --> 01:08:13.603
the daughter of Agatha Earnshaw.

01:08:16.304 --> 01:08:18.908
He passed them on the road
the day after Liam's funeral.

01:08:18.941 --> 01:08:19.876
After the funeral.

01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:24.345
He called her the most beautiful
creature he'd ever seen.

01:08:25.848 --> 01:08:26.783
I saw her too.

01:08:27.884 --> 01:08:29.283
I brought her here.

01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:36.792
I heard a scream, and then I
found her laying in the grass.

01:08:36.826 --> 01:08:38.292
Why didn't
you say something.

01:08:38.326 --> 01:08:40.562
I didn't say
anything to anyone.

01:08:40.595 --> 01:08:41.898
Not even Bridget I was so drunk.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.465
I hardly recall any of it.

01:08:47.804 --> 01:08:50.907
It all started after
that night, the sickness.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:54.777
She said her name was Audrey.

01:08:59.548 --> 01:09:01.283
Here.

01:09:01.316 --> 01:09:02.216
What's this.

01:09:03.586 --> 01:09:05.420
Every affliction
the village has seen.

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:08.991
Oh, god.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.796
Everything can be traced
back to the eclipse 17 years.

01:09:15.497 --> 01:09:17.466
If Agatha's her mother,
then who's the father?

01:10:37.512 --> 01:10:38.614
God, help us.

01:11:14.016 --> 01:11:15.517
Why are you doing this?

01:11:19.121 --> 01:11:19.989
What's your purpose?

01:11:22.825 --> 01:11:24.160
My purpose?

01:11:24.193 --> 01:11:25.928
You've corrupted
my daughter-in-law.

01:11:27.797 --> 01:11:32.567
You've propelled a man from
my congregation to suicide.

01:11:37.106 --> 01:11:39.474
Why did your mother
keep you secret?

01:11:40.743 --> 01:11:41.677
Answer me.

01:11:52.188 --> 01:11:53.089
I need to understand.

01:11:55.758 --> 01:11:57.927
I could explain, but it's
easier if I just show you.

01:12:40.568 --> 01:12:41.503
No.

01:12:44.206 --> 01:12:45.141
I can't.

01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:51.080
You can.

01:13:56.612 --> 01:13:57.813
Hello, Agatha.

01:13:57.847 --> 01:13:59.815
You frightened
me half to death.

01:13:59.849 --> 01:14:01.951
Where are you running off to?

01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:03.686
I was coming to find you.

01:14:05.888 --> 01:14:08.657
What are you doing here?

01:14:08.691 --> 01:14:10.026
We're
going to go and see Audrey.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:13.295
I wasn't running away.

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:16.132
That's not what I was doing.

01:14:16.165 --> 01:14:19.735
I know how hard
it can be to let go.

01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:40.189
Deirdre.

01:14:40.222 --> 01:14:41.957
What are you doing here?

01:14:41.991 --> 01:14:43.259
Of course, I'm here.

01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:44.894
Tonight's the?

01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:46.228
Eh?

01:14:46.262 --> 01:14:48.664
- Eh?
- It's the ingathering.

01:14:48.697 --> 01:14:49.832
Yes, exactly.

01:14:51.133 --> 01:14:52.802
Where were you
earlier before this?

01:14:52.835 --> 01:14:54.036
Home.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:55.704
What?

01:14:55.738 --> 01:14:57.139
You mean you weren't out there?

01:14:57.173 --> 01:14:58.941
No.

01:14:58.974 --> 01:15:00.076
Let me take your coat.

01:15:02.344 --> 01:15:04.280
No, it's fine I'll
keep it, it's cold.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.662
This will be over soon.

01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:22.298
I promise.

01:15:46.922 --> 01:15:47.923
We are pilgrims,

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:51.327
absolute in our conviction.

01:15:54.864 --> 01:15:57.666
We endure ridicule from
our fellow countrymen.

01:15:58.801 --> 01:16:01.904
Persecution even for our loyalty

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:03.339
to the rights of
our forefathers.

01:16:06.442 --> 01:16:08.144
But we know this is your will

01:16:10.412 --> 01:16:14.116
that our standard is
the most righteous path.

01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:17.820
God makes the sun rise and set.

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:20.322
And is faithful

01:16:20.356 --> 01:16:22.992
from generation to generation.

01:16:23.025 --> 01:16:26.095
God makes summer and
winter come and go.

01:16:26.128 --> 01:16:27.062
DEIRDRE AND
COLM: He is faithful

01:16:27.096 --> 01:16:29.832
from generation to generation

01:16:29.865 --> 01:16:33.836
God makes the plants
grow and flowers bloom.

01:16:33.869 --> 01:16:34.803
DEIRDRE AND
COLM: He is faithful

01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:37.406
from generation to generation.

01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:38.874
God gives us...

01:16:42.878 --> 01:16:43.812
Um?

01:16:47.183 --> 01:16:48.284
He grants us...

01:16:51.453 --> 01:16:52.388
No.

01:16:54.023 --> 01:16:54.957
God gives.

01:17:01.897 --> 01:17:05.167
God gives us food to
eat and people to love.

01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:08.470
He is faithful from
generation to generation.

01:17:08.504 --> 01:17:10.306
God is always with us.

01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:12.975
DEIRDRE AND
SEAMUS: He's faithful

01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:15.277
from generation to generation.

01:17:16.378 --> 01:17:17.446
Oh, Lord God,

01:17:18.547 --> 01:17:19.882
Father of all mercies,

01:17:22.117 --> 01:17:24.920
We yield thee praise and
thanksgiving for our deliverance

01:17:24.954 --> 01:17:26.288
from those great
and apparent dangers

01:17:26.322 --> 01:17:27.723
wherewith we were compassed.

01:17:30.492 --> 01:17:32.895
Please deliver my Bridget
from this sickness.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:36.999
Spare this famine
from another death

01:17:37.032 --> 01:17:38.167
through Christ, our Lord.

01:17:45.574 --> 01:17:46.775
Bridget.

01:17:46.809 --> 01:17:48.010
Bridget, Bridget.

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:49.044
Bridget.

01:17:49.078 --> 01:17:50.479
Hey, hey, hey!

01:17:50.512 --> 01:17:51.447
Come on.

01:17:53.949 --> 01:17:54.883
Hey.

01:17:56.018 --> 01:17:56.885
Bridget, don't do this.

01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:00.222
Listen, listen to
me, listen to me.

01:18:00.256 --> 01:18:03.092
I'm sorry for how things
were after Liam, okay.

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:05.494
Okay, I know I could
be a better husband.

01:18:13.535 --> 01:18:14.470
Bridget.

01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:20.209
Please, Love, please
don't leave me too.

01:18:23.112 --> 01:18:25.247
Don't
die on me please.

01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:26.215
I need you.

01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:29.985
Please.

01:18:33.623 --> 01:18:35.057
Should we go check on them?

01:18:37.459 --> 01:18:39.028
He'll
need some space.

01:18:40.362 --> 01:18:42.164
What about Bridget?

01:18:42.197 --> 01:18:44.833
- No.
- What?

01:18:44.867 --> 01:18:46.468
We should prepare
for the worst.

01:18:46.502 --> 01:18:48.037
What has gotten into you?

01:18:49.538 --> 01:18:51.340
You couldn't recall
the prayers earlier.

01:18:53.242 --> 01:18:56.312
We've all been under a tremendous
amount of stress lately.

01:18:56.345 --> 01:18:58.847
No, Dad, that's not it.

01:18:58.881 --> 01:18:59.848
Not for you.

01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:01.884
What are you suggesting?

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:03.485
I saw you earlier.

01:19:04.621 --> 01:19:06.121
You were with the Earnshaw girl.

01:19:09.158 --> 01:19:12.294
That, that belonged to Lochlan.

01:19:12.328 --> 01:19:14.530
They stashed his body in
the fucking wood shed.

01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:38.354
Why were you with her?

01:19:38.387 --> 01:19:40.289
She appeared before me.

01:19:40.322 --> 01:19:42.391
Do you know what
happened to Bernard?

01:19:42.424 --> 01:19:43.359
Yes.

01:19:47.529 --> 01:19:49.031
I know only too well.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.635
Colm!

01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:54.169
Colm, get down here immediately!

01:19:55.471 --> 01:19:56.639
Colm!

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.585
- What happened?
- Look at him.

01:20:10.386 --> 01:20:11.387
What, what is it?

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.421
He was with the Earnshaw girl.

01:20:14.256 --> 01:20:15.224
She was here?

01:20:15.257 --> 01:20:16.593
I saw them both together.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.294
Hand me the gun.

01:20:19.328 --> 01:20:20.663
Something's wrong, believe me.

01:20:20.697 --> 01:20:21.631
Deirdre?

01:20:22.965 --> 01:20:24.533
The Earnshaws killed Lochlan.

01:20:24.566 --> 01:20:26.068
She's right.

01:20:26.101 --> 01:20:28.671
- Look at him.
- Give me bloody gun.

01:20:28.705 --> 01:20:30.239
Deirdre's right.

01:20:30.272 --> 01:20:31.540
She's here.

01:20:31.573 --> 01:20:32.975
What?

01:20:33.008 --> 01:20:34.276
She's here.

01:20:34.309 --> 01:20:35.277
Audrey.

01:20:54.563 --> 01:20:56.198
Bridget's gone.

01:20:56.231 --> 01:20:57.566
And I need to die too.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.701
What are you saying?

01:20:58.735 --> 01:21:00.135
We'll find Audrey!

01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:01.170
We'll settle this!

01:21:01.203 --> 01:21:03.005
Just fucking do it!

01:21:03.038 --> 01:21:04.339
I can't bear it!

01:21:04.373 --> 01:21:05.541
I can't bear it one fucking...

01:21:19.054 --> 01:21:20.623
What have you done?

01:21:20.657 --> 01:21:22.458
- What have you done, you?
- I don't know.

01:21:22.491 --> 01:21:23.626
Fucking fool!

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.722
I brought you into our home!

01:21:52.755 --> 01:21:54.691
I took care of you, why?

01:21:54.724 --> 01:21:56.425
What did we do to deserve this?

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.126
I was in the cart the day
you threatened my mother.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.428
What did she do to deserve that?

01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:00.562
It was my son's funeral.

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.776
What is it?

01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:18.715
What is this?

01:22:34.096 --> 01:22:36.298
Do you know how many
girls died trying?

01:22:39.836 --> 01:22:41.236
I carry you to term.

01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:45.541
They'll tell you.

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:49.612
The jealousy was so awful.

01:22:50.747 --> 01:22:52.682
They weren't so strong.

01:22:52.715 --> 01:22:54.283
They couldn't do what I did.

01:23:07.329 --> 01:23:08.363
Say something.

01:23:14.169 --> 01:23:15.103
Thank you.

01:23:35.157 --> 01:23:37.125
No, goddamn you, Audrey!

01:23:37.159 --> 01:23:38.527
No!

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.596
Please no!

01:23:44.266 --> 01:23:45.500
Do you enjoy the struggle?

01:23:47.737 --> 01:23:49.806
Pouring sweat over fields
that'll never sprout.

01:23:51.941 --> 01:23:55.143
No, please don't do this.

01:23:55.177 --> 01:23:57.312
- Anything you want.
- Please.

01:23:57.346 --> 01:23:59.548
Anything it's yours.

01:24:01.584 --> 01:24:02.652
I promise you.

01:24:02.685 --> 01:24:07.389
Don't do this.

01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:09.391
Who's the father?

01:24:16.899 --> 01:24:17.767
There's no father.

01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:22.371
I'm still a virgin.

01:24:38.655 --> 01:24:39.956
No, please.

01:24:39.989 --> 01:24:41.658
Please have mercy on me!

01:24:41.691 --> 01:24:42.892
Don't do this!

01:24:42.925 --> 01:24:44.192
No!

01:24:44.226 --> 01:24:45.260
No, no, don't!

01:24:46.361 --> 01:24:50.365
No.

01:24:52.401 --> 01:24:53.335
Please no.

01:24:54.403 --> 01:24:55.337
No, no!

01:24:56.438 --> 01:24:57.907
No, no!

01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:59.441
Please, no!

01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:02.244
I beg you please don't do this!

01:25:02.277 --> 01:25:03.245
No!

01:25:04.312 --> 01:25:05.313
No.

01:25:05.347 --> 01:25:06.949
No, no, please!

01:25:06.983 --> 01:25:08.685
Please don't do this.

01:25:17.526 --> 01:25:19.662
He's faithful from
generation to generation.

01:25:19.696 --> 01:25:20.630
No, please.

01:28:33.789 --> 01:28:34.724
Colm.

01:28:36.626 --> 01:28:37.760
It's coming.

01:28:46.969 --> 01:28:48.871
- One last push.
- Come on.

01:28:48.905 --> 01:28:50.505
- Push.
- Come on.

01:28:50.538 --> 01:28:51.573
Come on, Love.

01:29:14.163 --> 01:29:15.097
What is it?

01:29:16.832 --> 01:29:18.466
Boy or girl?

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.535
Come on what is it?

01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:23.172
- Oh, god.
- What's wrong?

01:29:23.205 --> 01:29:24.173
What's wrong?

01:29:26.042 --> 01:29:27.109
Christ.

01:29:27.143 --> 01:29:29.745
What, what's wrong?

01:29:29.779 --> 01:29:30.713
No, no.

01:29:32.214 --> 01:29:33.816
- What's happening?
- Don't look!

01:29:45.861 --> 01:29:47.495
Kill it!

01:29:57.139 --> 01:29:58.908
Colm, please come back!

01:30:02.577 --> 01:30:03.511
Kill it!
