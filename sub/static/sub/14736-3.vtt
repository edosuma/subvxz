00:08.969 --> 00:11.432
So, what should
we do today?

00:11.432 --> 00:14.435
A long walk in the park,
a long bike ride in the woods,

00:14.435 --> 00:16.306
a long swim at the pool...

00:16.306 --> 00:20.401
Shelby, did you enter us in
a triathlon I'm not aware of?

00:20.401 --> 00:23.484
I'm happy just staying
here and looking out
this big window.

00:23.484 --> 00:25.566
Daisy, remember?
That's a TV.

00:25.566 --> 00:28.279
Oh, right.

00:28.279 --> 00:31.362
I was wondering why your
neighbors were so good
at solving crimes.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.287
We have to take
her somewhere.

00:36.287 --> 00:39.580
Daisy's a princess from
500 years ago and all she's
seen is my house,

00:39.580 --> 00:42.333
Naldo's house, Barry's lab
and the school.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.507
Don't forget that visit to
urgent care after the whole
"eating a wax apple" incident.

00:46.507 --> 00:50.261
How was I supposed to know?
It looked real!

00:52.513 --> 00:55.766
Guys, bad news.
My cousin has food poisoning.

00:55.766 --> 01:00.441
But good news, he's willing
to give clams another chance!

01:00.441 --> 01:03.314
And since he's home sick,
he said I can use his kiosk
at the mall

01:03.314 --> 01:06.447
to sell my state-themed
novelty T-shirts!

01:06.447 --> 01:08.609
"Sass-achusetts
is for Divas"?

01:08.609 --> 01:10.401
Who's gonna buy that?
 I will.

01:10.401 --> 01:11.612
I got a high-maintenance
cousin from Massachusetts.

01:11.612 --> 01:13.364
She is such a princess.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.287
No offense.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.751
The mall... Cyd,
that gives me the best idea
for what we can do

01:20.751 --> 01:23.584
with Daisy this afternoon.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.336

Oh, Daisy,

01:27.418 --> 01:29.340
you're gonna love
Epic Girls' Day.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.382
As long as it doesn't involve
being locked in a tower

01:31.382 --> 01:32.383
and fed through a slot,
I'm in.

01:34.515 --> 01:36.347
You got a pretty low bar,
and I like it!

01:38.519 --> 01:40.811
Cyd and I invented
Epic Girls' Day.

It's the ultimate

I'll come with you guys.

01:48.529 --> 01:50.441
I just need to stop by
my house to grab my T-shirts.

It's okay.

me in three, two, one...

Three, two...

02:05.456 --> 02:07.418
Renaldo, you came back for me!

02:07.418 --> 02:09.340
Yeah!

02:09.340 --> 02:10.591
It definitely wasn't because
I forgot my jacket.

That's there 'cause of us.
 Oh.

03:33.634 --> 03:37.638
On our first Epic Girls' Day,
we made the mannequins
touch each other's butts.

03:37.638 --> 03:39.930

Super got us thrown
in mall jail.

03:39.930 --> 03:41.602

03:44.845 --> 03:46.807
Now, we always start
an Epic Girls' Day

03:46.807 --> 03:49.850
by getting free smoothies
from Larry.
I'll be right back.

03:49.850 --> 03:51.612
Why does Larry give
you free smoothies?

03:51.612 --> 03:53.484
Shelby saved his
pot-bellied pig once

03:53.484 --> 03:55.486
by giving it mouth-to-snout.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.857
It was the most heroic thing
I've ever laughed at.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.952
All I could get was the
usual two free smoothies.

04:01.952 --> 04:05.536
But I also got
a "just because" card
from Piggy Smalls.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.668
That pig is so sweet.

04:07.668 --> 04:10.581
Look, he wrote
"Keep it squeal!"

04:12.463 --> 04:14.585
There's only two.
You take them.

04:14.585 --> 04:16.877
Daisy, this day
is all about you.

04:16.877 --> 04:19.470
You take this one and
Cyd can have the other one.

04:19.470 --> 04:22.593
No, it's okay, you're
the reason we get free
smoothies. You have it.

04:22.593 --> 04:23.884
All right. Thanks.

04:23.884 --> 04:26.557

this with me, Shelby.

Renaldo, why didn't you
tell me you wanted to turn
your hobby into a business?

04:48.669 --> 04:51.542
Well, I just wanted to do it
my way, and you sometimes...

04:51.542 --> 04:53.003
Take things over?
No, I don't.

04:53.003 --> 04:55.676

 What I just did with
your sentence?

something I do.

Don't you think it
would be better

if you hung the T-shirts
with the designs facing out?

05:16.987 --> 05:18.939
Barry. You said you
wouldn't take over.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.861
Yes, right, of course.

05:24.785 --> 05:28.619
But how will people know
that this shirt says,

05:28.619 --> 05:32.042
"Windy-ana is for Farting"?

05:32.042 --> 05:34.715
I like that my customers
have to turn them around.

05:34.715 --> 05:37.628
That way they have
a fun surprise.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.721
It's a shopping experience
designed around maximum
enjoyment and minimum logic.

05:40.721 --> 05:43.594
Make sense?

05:43.594 --> 05:47.888
About as much sense
as your "shoplifters

getting too old to shop
at Lil' Mister Cool Pants.

balloons around our wrists.

like the choo-choo,

11:30.150 --> 11:33.153
I'm playing Daisy.
 No, I'm playing Daisy.

11:33.153 --> 11:35.025
BOTH: Winner plays Daisy!

11:36.907 --> 11:38.739
I haven't seen dancing
this angry

11:38.739 --> 11:40.320
since my father made
the court jester work
on his birthday.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.326
Urban Bro is the coolest.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.288
I think this could
be our new look.

11:53.093 --> 11:54.334
(LAUGHING)

11:54.334 --> 11:56.927
Bret, you look ridiculous!

11:56.927 --> 11:58.388
You're wearing it too!

11:59.259 --> 12:00.971
Aw, man!

12:02.392 --> 12:04.264
This is definitely us.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.729
(LAUGHING)

12:09.729 --> 12:10.440
Dude.

12:12.112 --> 12:13.193
Aw, man!

12:20.360 --> 12:21.361
Whoa!

12:21.361 --> 12:23.203
We're wearing
different outfits.

12:23.203 --> 12:25.365
It's like I'm looking
in a mirror,

12:25.365 --> 12:28.168
only someone else is in it
and it's not a mirror at all.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.172
Mom's gonna freak.

12:32.172 --> 12:34.374
We can't be her pair
of freckly bookends
if we don't match.

12:34.374 --> 12:37.177
I like this outfit.
It feels like me.

12:37.177 --> 12:38.468
Well, this outfit
feels like me.

12:38.468 --> 12:40.180
You're just gonna
have to change.

12:40.180 --> 12:41.431
No, you change.
 No, you change!

12:41.431 --> 12:43.223
No, you change!
 Wait,

12:43.223 --> 12:44.474
I have an idea.
What if

12:44.474 --> 12:46.146
you change.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.481
(MUSIC PLAYING)

12:51.481 --> 12:54.104
(PANTING) I'm gonna

12:54.104 --> 12:55.445
take you down.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.277
(PANTING) Not if I

12:57.277 --> 12:58.158
take you down first.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.491
(MUSIC STOPS)

13:01.491 --> 13:04.364
Yes, I won!

13:04.364 --> 13:07.287
(PANTING)
I'm not even tired.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.460
All right, Daisy,
ready to do this?

13:11.331 --> 13:14.414
Where is she?

13:14.414 --> 13:17.297
Cyd, we lost Daisy.
Again!

13:17.297 --> 13:19.179
I'm starting to understand
those kid leashes.

13:21.341 --> 13:22.923
Look, we have to find her.

13:22.923 --> 13:24.184
I'll go this way
and you go that way.

13:24.184 --> 13:25.425
I know what you're doing.

13:25.425 --> 13:27.427
You think she's this way,
so you want me to go that way.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.139
Let's just pick
a direction and go.

13:29.139 --> 13:29.890
Fine!

13:32.272 --> 13:35.145
You know what?
I'll go this way.

13:38.398 --> 13:42.202
I don't care if you
only have this many.

13:42.202 --> 13:44.284
It costs this many.

13:46.246 --> 13:49.209
Oh, look who suddenly found
an extra "this many!"

13:53.213 --> 13:55.165
Barry!
What have you done?

13:55.165 --> 13:58.218
Isn't it great?
I actually made
Naldo-Tees profitable!

13:58.218 --> 14:00.300
But you promised not to...
 Oh, hold that thought.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.173
I'm getting a nibble on
"Shy-oming is for Introverts."

14:03.173 --> 14:06.306
I've had a lot of interest
on that one, but not a lot
of eye contact.

14:13.273 --> 14:15.185
I couldn't find
Daisy anywhere!

14:15.185 --> 14:19.189
I can't believe we lost
a 500-year-old princess
at the mall.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.321
Look, let's just jump back
to when we rode the train.

14:21.321 --> 14:22.482
We know we were with her then.

14:22.482 --> 14:25.115
Forget it. You just want to
have fun with her again,

14:25.115 --> 14:26.246
while I'm left
standing around.

14:26.246 --> 14:28.408
Let's jump to the photo booth.

14:28.408 --> 14:32.202
Oh, what, so I can be
crowded out of every picture
for a second time? No, thanks.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.164
I've felt like
a third wheel all day.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.206
You've felt like
a third wheel?

14:36.206 --> 14:38.418
At least you got an
adorable smoothie and
a delicious puppy!

14:38.418 --> 14:42.502
Or something like that.
I get all mixed up
when I'm mad!

14:42.502 --> 14:45.345
Can we talk about this later?
Right now we just need
to find Daisy.

14:45.345 --> 14:46.466
At least we agree on that.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.268
So you know where
we're jumping?

14:48.268 --> 14:50.140
Yep, to the train.
 No, the photo booth!

14:52.272 --> 14:56.396
Daisy! I knew if we jumped
back to when we were on
the train, we'd find you.

14:58.318 --> 15:00.190
Yes! The photo booth!

15:00.190 --> 15:01.521
I knew this was the best
place to find you.

15:02.442 --> 15:03.523
I told you, Cyd.

15:05.525 --> 15:07.367
Wait.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.288
Where's Cyd?

15:08.528 --> 15:09.529
Who's Cyd?

15:12.372 --> 15:13.203
Where's Shelby?

15:13.203 --> 15:14.494
Who's Shelby?

15:14.494 --> 15:15.535
What do you mean?
She's our friend.

15:15.535 --> 15:19.499
This is her right here.

15:19.499 --> 15:23.503
She's not there.
That doesn't make sense.

15:23.503 --> 15:27.217
Me and Shelby brought you
here for an Epic Girls' Day.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.469
No, you brought me here
for an Epic Girls' Day.

15:29.469 --> 15:32.432
But that means...

15:32.432 --> 15:36.476
I time-traveled my best friend
out of existence.

15:45.405 --> 15:48.488
Did I jump to a timeline
where Cyd doesn't exist?

15:48.488 --> 15:49.409
Is that possible?

15:49.409 --> 15:51.331
Anything's possible.

15:51.331 --> 15:54.244
I mean, chickens, right?

15:54.244 --> 15:56.336
We'll definitely
circle back on that.

15:56.336 --> 15:59.289
But right now I'm a little
focused on the fact that
my best friend is gone.

15:59.289 --> 16:01.341
How did this happen?

16:01.341 --> 16:04.544
Maybe I was trying so hard
not to be a third wheel

16:04.544 --> 16:07.467
that I time-traveled to
a place where I couldn't
be a third wheel.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.220
Is that possible?
 Anything's possible.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.302
I mean, chickens.
 Right?

16:13.553 --> 16:16.226
How am I going to fix this?

16:16.226 --> 16:18.308
I can't jump back to when
Cyd exists if I don't have
a Cyd to jump with.

16:24.444 --> 16:26.276
This is how we're
dressing now.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.567
No, this is how
we're dressing now!

16:28.448 --> 16:29.369
Boys?

16:29.369 --> 16:30.610
BOTH: Mom?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.453
What are you wearing?

16:33.453 --> 16:35.375
It's called
the layered look.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.578
Nancy in Juniors says
I can pull it off.

16:38.578 --> 16:42.252
I thought I told you
this store was for big boys.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.383
We are big boys!

16:43.383 --> 16:45.545
And we want to start
dressing different.

16:45.545 --> 16:48.548
But Bret won't wear the same
different clothes as me!

16:50.340 --> 16:53.513
I knew someday
this would happen.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.436
I've always loved taking you
to Lil' Mister Cool Pants

16:56.436 --> 16:58.558
and dressing you
in matching outfits.

16:58.558 --> 17:00.310
But you're right.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.272
You're teenagers now.

17:02.272 --> 17:06.356
And if you want
to dress differently,
it's okay with me.

17:06.356 --> 17:08.318
But if we don't
dress the same,

17:08.318 --> 17:10.490
we won't be your freckly
little bookends anymore.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.452
You'll always be my
freckly little bookends.

17:12.452 --> 17:16.326
You'll just be bookends
that don't share pants.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.540
Are you ready for that, Bret?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.583
The question is,
is the world ready for us?

17:23.583 --> 17:26.425
Only one way to find out.

17:26.425 --> 17:29.589
(ALARM BLARING)
 Boys, wait, we have
to pay for those!

17:29.589 --> 17:31.301
They already have
two strikes at this mall!

17:39.729 --> 17:41.561
Renaldo, what are you
doing sitting around?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.314
I could really use
some assistance over here.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.445
Nah, I don't want to.

17:45.445 --> 17:47.777
What are you talking about?
This is your thing!

17:47.777 --> 17:49.359
Is it?
 Yes.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.450
Is it?
 Yes.

17:50.450 --> 17:51.611
Is it?
 No?

17:52.612 --> 17:54.454
Exactly!

17:54.454 --> 17:56.326
Barry, you took over my thing.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.538
But I'm making tons of money.

17:58.538 --> 18:00.540
This was never about
making money.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.792
It was about me sharing
the shirts I love to make,

18:02.792 --> 18:05.505
the way I wanted
to share them.

18:05.505 --> 18:07.337
And you took it over
and did it your way.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.474
Renaldo, you're right.

18:14.474 --> 18:16.556
I should have realized
how important this was to you.

18:16.556 --> 18:19.309
I'm sorry I took over
Naldo-Tees.

18:19.309 --> 18:20.310
From now on,
we'll do it your way.

18:23.313 --> 18:24.484
How much do you have?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.568
All right.
A booger-75 it is.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.442
Barry?
 Fine.

18:32.442 --> 18:33.783
A booger-50.

18:36.496 --> 18:37.577
So?

18:37.577 --> 18:39.409
How did that make you feel?

18:39.409 --> 18:41.451
Just desperate for
my hand sanitizer.

18:43.543 --> 18:45.375
But also really good.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.797
Listen up,
West Portland Promenade!

18:47.797 --> 18:50.460
Free shirts for everyone!

18:50.460 --> 18:51.591
(ALL CHEERING)

19:00.600 --> 19:02.432
Whoa! Barry,
that was awesome!

19:02.432 --> 19:06.356
What are you talking about?
I started a riot!

19:06.356 --> 19:09.479
Barry, a riot's just
a party you didn't know
you were throwing.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.653
You have a lot to learn
about business.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.452
Shelby, cheer up.

19:23.623 --> 19:25.625
Oh, I know.

19:25.625 --> 19:28.378
Let's sit in these
massage chairs.

19:28.378 --> 19:30.550
You know who loved
a massage chair?

19:30.550 --> 19:31.631
Cyd.

19:31.631 --> 19:34.794
She'd set it to deep tissue
and fall asleep.

19:34.794 --> 19:38.508
I'd sit right here
and stare at her face.

19:38.508 --> 19:41.641
Oh, she had the cheekbones
of a model and the chin
of an anchorman.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.515
I wish she was here.

19:45.515 --> 19:47.517
Cyd, would a smoothie
cheer you up?

19:47.517 --> 19:49.649
It wouldn't taste the same
without Shelby.

19:49.649 --> 19:53.233
Her big heart got us
a lifetime of free smoothies

19:53.233 --> 19:54.814
and a chance for a pig to see
his piglets grow up.

19:54.814 --> 19:57.527
I completely understand.

19:57.527 --> 19:59.409
I just have to ask again,
who's Shelby?

20:01.411 --> 20:05.915
Only my best friend
in the whole world.

20:05.915 --> 20:08.878
She made every day
an Epic Girls' Day.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.505
These mannequins sent Cyd
and me to mall jail.

20:15.505 --> 20:18.838
We used to have fun
no matter what we did,

20:18.838 --> 20:20.600
as long as we did it together.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.851
Cyd?
 Shelby!

20:31.851 --> 20:33.653
I was just making this
mannequin touch
the other one's butt.

20:33.653 --> 20:35.855
So was I.

20:35.855 --> 20:37.697
We were thinking
of the same thing.

20:37.697 --> 20:39.699
Maybe that's why we jumped
back into the same timeline.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.623
When I saw you having
so much fun with Daisy,

20:43.623 --> 20:45.705
I went a little crazy trying
not to be the third wheel.

20:45.705 --> 20:47.827
Samesies, but flipsies.

20:49.629 --> 20:51.631
I've never felt left out
with you before.

20:51.631 --> 20:53.873
I never want to feel
that way again.

20:53.873 --> 20:58.798
I guess learning how to add
Daisy into the mix is gonna
be an adventure,

20:58.798 --> 21:02.972
but if any friends can
handle it, it's us.

21:02.972 --> 21:05.885
Now let's grab Daisy
and go home.

21:05.885 --> 21:08.598
Cyd, we're back
in the timeline
where Daisy's missing.

21:08.598 --> 21:11.811
Aw, man, we need to
get that girl a bell!

21:12.852 --> 21:15.695
Should we find
a security guard?

21:15.695 --> 21:17.857
I think one's
already found us.

21:19.819 --> 21:20.900
Is this for touching
the mannequins?

21:24.744 --> 21:26.746
Getting hauled off
to mall jail.

21:26.746 --> 21:28.668
We still got it, Shelbs.

21:28.668 --> 21:30.580
Classic Epic Girls' Day.

21:33.623 --> 21:35.715
Hands off, Dennis.
We know the way.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.724
Daisy!
There you are!

21:44.724 --> 21:46.015
What are you doing in here?

21:46.015 --> 21:46.976
And with Puppy!

21:48.848 --> 21:50.770
I named the fish Puppy.

21:50.770 --> 21:54.564
I thought it would make me
feel more like I was holding
a puppy.

21:54.564 --> 21:55.895
I got the sense that I was
coming between you two.

21:55.895 --> 21:58.778
So, I thought I'd
give you some space.

21:58.778 --> 22:00.990
Yeah, sorry for
making things weird.

22:00.990 --> 22:03.943
It's okay, it gave me time
to explore your mall.

22:03.943 --> 22:06.946
I got a manicure and
set all the puppies free.

22:06.946 --> 22:09.869
They put you in mall jail
for getting a manicure...

22:09.869 --> 22:14.544
And as I'm saying that,
I realize it's
the other thing.

22:14.544 --> 22:17.717
Don't worry, I'll just
text Barry and Naldo
to come get us out.

22:21.921 --> 22:22.762
What did you guys do?

22:22.762 --> 22:25.555
I incited a riot.

22:25.555 --> 22:26.926
And I've never
been more proud.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.733
What did you two do?

22:33.733 --> 22:36.646
We got arrested
by the fashion police
for looking too good!

22:38.778 --> 22:39.899
Shoplifting.

22:39.899 --> 22:41.981
Ah.
 That makes sense.

22:41.981 --> 22:45.695
You know, being locked up
isn't so bad when you're
not alone.

22:50.950 --> 22:52.752
We're back in that room!

22:53.623 --> 22:55.044
Cyd,

22:55.044 --> 22:56.996
I think this is Daisy's tower.

23:02.001 --> 23:03.593
(BOTH SCREAMING)

23:08.638 --> 23:10.770
Okay, I've bailed
you all out.

23:10.770 --> 23:12.892
But we should stay
here for a minute.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.698
