WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:04.371
-GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
-I'm Faith.

00:04.405 --> 00:07.375
GILES: A rogue Slayer
 on our hands. I can't think
 of anything more dangerous.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.676
-Faith, no!
-You killed a man.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.544
-I don't care.
-She's unstable, Buffy.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.746
(gasps)

00:20.388 --> 00:24.158
I'm not a demon, little girl.
I am something that you
can't even conceive.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.594
The First Evil.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.597
Look, I'm not saying it's
a happy scenario, but we're
dealing with a big bad

00:29.629 --> 00:31.164
that can be
any dead person it wants.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.368
You know the rules.
I can't take corporeal form.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.271
-BUFFY: They're all Slayers?
-GILES: Potential Slayers.

00:38.305 --> 00:41.174
There were many more like them
 all over the world.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.344
-But now there's
 just a handful.
-That's what it wants.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.914
GILES: To erase
 all the Slayers-in-training
 and their watchers,

00:46.947 --> 00:50.951
-along with their methods.
-BUFFY: And then Faith,
and then me.

00:51.784 --> 00:53.253
It's the end.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.088
No more Slayer.

00:55.122 --> 00:58.591
Spike has a soul now.
That's what's gonna stop him
from hurting people.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.395
Buffy--
He can be
a good man, Giles.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.897
-I feel it.
-Willow, call for you
from L.A.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.066
Somebody named Fred?

01:06.099 --> 01:08.769
I'm gonna have to take off
for a while. Maybe a day or two.

01:08.801 --> 01:13.240
We're on the verge of war.
You need to make difficult
decisions regardless of cost.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.942
You're stalling me.

01:14.974 --> 01:18.879
I've been searching for you
for a very, very long time.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.948
-Ever since
you killed my mother.
-(roaring)

01:21.981 --> 01:25.319
Try anything again,
he'll kill you.

01:26.653 --> 01:30.691
More importantly...
I'll let him.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.828
I think you've taught me
everything I need to know.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.745
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Please!

01:51.778 --> 01:53.347
-What's going on?
-Please, get me out of here.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.915
Is someone hurt?
What is it?

01:55.948 --> 01:57.049
Drive!

02:03.022 --> 02:04.625
Well, that was, uh--

02:06.993 --> 02:09.461
Are you all right?

02:09.497 --> 02:12.332
(panting)
Thank you.
Thank god you were there.

02:12.365 --> 02:15.269
Well, let's not give him
credit for everything.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.605
No, I'm funnin' ya.
I don't believe
in coincidence.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.108
I also don't believe
young girls should be
out in the woods late at night.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.811
Should be tucked in bed.
I wish I was.

02:23.843 --> 02:26.347
I expect you do
at that.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.849
Look. I don't mean to pry,
but those boys--
they looked like--

02:32.853 --> 02:35.389
Well, you didn't happen
to fall in with devil
worshippers, did you?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.461
No, I'm sorry.
You, uh--

02:40.493 --> 02:42.562
You look like you've been
traveling a while.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.198
I didn't think that--

02:46.567 --> 02:48.901
Is there someplace
you'd like me to drop you?
You heading someplace?

02:50.570 --> 02:53.139
-Sunnydale.
-I'm going there myself.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.975
I ain't never been,
but I expect we can find
a police station or--

02:56.009 --> 02:58.246
I just need to get
to Revello Drive.

02:59.612 --> 03:03.217
Um, but thanks,
uh, Father--

03:03.251 --> 03:06.086
Call me Caleb.
Never was nobody's daddy.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.590
I'm Shannon.
Well, Shannon,

03:09.622 --> 03:12.793
you feel like telling me
why those freaky Joes
were after you?

03:14.395 --> 03:16.663
I'm not sure.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.900
Well, do you ever think that
maybe they were chasing you
because you're a whore?

03:22.068 --> 03:24.771
-What?
-Now, I know
what you're thinking.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.240
Crazy preacher man,
spouting off at the mouth

03:27.275 --> 03:29.909
about the Whore of Babylon
or some such.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.579
That ain't me.
I'm not here
to lecture you.

03:32.612 --> 03:36.550
I mean, what's the point?
My words just curdle
in your ears.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.586
Wouldn't take in
a thing.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.822
Head filled with
so much filth that...

03:42.823 --> 03:45.526
ain't no room
for words of truth.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.159
Well, you know
what you are, Shannon?

03:49.462 --> 03:51.264
-Dirty.
-What? I'm not.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.401
Now, now, now, now, now,
there's no blame here.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.937
Now, you were born dirty.
Born without a soul.

03:57.971 --> 04:03.143
Born with that gaping maw
wants to open up,
suck out a man's marrow.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.447
Makes me puke to
think too hard on it.

04:09.317 --> 04:12.719
Yeah, that there door
is problematical.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.254
I don't know as I could
recommend stepping out
at this speed anyway.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.591
You're like as much
to tumble some.

04:17.625 --> 04:21.629
And of course,
there's my boys back there.
They hate to miss a mark.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.230
-Your boys?
-Well, they ain't exactly
my blue-eyed boys.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.567
But, uh,
they're hard workers.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.002
And, uh, they don't
truck with Satan.
That was just me having fun.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.838
Satan is a little man.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.244
(tires squealing)

04:37.276 --> 04:39.379
I don't like
backseat drivers.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.521
Please... don't hurt me.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.889
Well, now is this
the part where you
offer to do anything?

04:51.057 --> 04:52.992
Because I tried
to make it clear to you,

04:53.026 --> 04:55.095
you got nothing
I want to explore.

04:55.127 --> 04:57.230
(screams)
Oh, yeah!

04:57.331 --> 05:00.834
That's it!
Now that's a cleansin' fire!
Hallelujah!

05:00.867 --> 05:03.036
(gasping)

05:05.805 --> 05:09.476
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
there's a car
a little ways behind us.

05:09.509 --> 05:13.146
And I do believe there's
some folk in it going
the same place you are.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.048
Now, I want you to deliver
a message for me,
but it's not for them.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.951
It's for the other one.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.254
The one and only,
the original, accept-
no-substitutes Slayer.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.494
Would you tell her
something for me?

05:26.526 --> 05:27.694
Yes.

05:29.497 --> 05:33.165
Thank you, Shannon.
(clattering)

05:33.199 --> 05:34.401
(grunts)

05:38.004 --> 05:40.908
(indistinct whispering)

05:43.511 --> 05:47.747
Now, let's see
what we can't do
about that door.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.283
(gasps, grunting)

05:52.586 --> 05:55.288
(tires skid)

05:57.524 --> 06:00.894
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.762
Can you talk?

06:04.964 --> 06:07.401
This girl's bleeding badly.
We have to get her
to the hospital.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.439
Yep, I guess I'm back
in Sunnydale.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.110
(theme music playing)

07:18.271 --> 07:20.106
I know it's hard.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.810
I haven't
been able to sleep
the last few nights.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.446
Hey, listen.
It's gonna be okay.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.415
Buffy knows
what she's doing.

07:28.447 --> 07:32.119
She's not gonna send you
into battle until she's sure
you're ready for action.

07:32.151 --> 07:37.057
That's just it, though.
How will I know I'm ready
for action?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.826
You have to trust us.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.629
I'm so scared, Xander.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.331
And I'm so young.

07:44.363 --> 07:48.134
Well, believe it or not,
I was younger than you
when I started all this.

07:48.168 --> 07:52.004
There's just so much
I haven't done.
So much I need to do.

07:52.038 --> 07:55.375
It's, like, I never had
a real boyfriend, you know?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.810
Yeah?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.516
I've never been with a man.

08:04.216 --> 08:06.052
I could die tomorrow,

08:07.687 --> 08:09.557
and I've never
been with a man.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.291
Well, um--

08:12.324 --> 08:15.362
I've never been
with a man before either.

08:15.394 --> 08:16.663
Colleen.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.331
I've never been with her
in front of a man before.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.502
I've never been with her
in front of a man either.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.706
(gulps)
Um--

08:26.740 --> 08:28.074
Xander--

08:29.242 --> 08:32.178
We can't.
We're so scared.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.215
-The others might hear us.
-No, they won't.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.049
They're okay.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.355
(girls laughing, screaming)

08:51.230 --> 08:52.732
RONA: Xander! Xander!

08:52.765 --> 08:54.234
What?
God dammit!

08:54.267 --> 08:57.770
What's going on?
I was sleeping.

08:57.804 --> 09:01.041
Dominique has the stomach flu,
and the toilet bowl
is backed up.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.878
I'll be right out.
Got a--

09:04.912 --> 09:07.080
A leg cramp.
(chuckles)

09:12.085 --> 09:13.452
FAITH: You sure she's one of us?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.956
She don't look
like much now.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.259
Not a Potential
Slayer, I mean.
Don't know.

09:20.293 --> 09:24.898
Seems to fit, though.
We'll know more
when she regains consciousness.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.434
If she regains
consciousness. Girl's
been gutted like a catfish.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.336
Yeah.

09:33.139 --> 09:37.543
Something's killing girls
all over the world, trying
to end the Slayer line.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.080
Thing like that,
figure I might get
a heads-up.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.549
Faith.
Guess it doesn't
really matter,

09:43.582 --> 09:45.251
as long as you've got
the true Slayer intact.

09:45.284 --> 09:49.288
You were in prison.
We figured you were
safe there.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.292
Yeah, that's prison.
Safe as a kitten.
Sorry.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.729
I don't know much
about the big house.
Was it--

09:55.763 --> 09:59.298
I mean, did something
happen in there?

09:59.331 --> 10:02.469
Someone came at me
with a nasty-looking knife.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.638
Didn't really know why,
until now.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.606
-Faith, we didn't--
-Forget it. It's cool.
I get by.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.311
What are we gonna
do about her?

10:11.344 --> 10:15.916
Uh, I guess
we should find Buffy,
tell her what's going on.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.485
I-i tried calling home.
Dawn said she's out patrolling.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.788
Hm. Let's go
look for her.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.621
Cemetery's
more fun anyway.
Wait.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.825
Somebody should wait here
in case she wakes up.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.860
-Fine. Sit tight.
I'll be back.
-W-Wait.

10:27.894 --> 10:33.265
Uh, maybe you
meeting Buffy alone
isn't the best idea.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.769
You told her the sitch, right?
She's knows I'm coming.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.806
Probably been up all night
hanging streamers.

10:38.838 --> 10:42.676
Yeah, but it's not like
you're study buddies exactly.

10:42.710 --> 10:48.514
Um, maybe it'd be better
if I eased her
into the whole thing.

10:48.548 --> 10:53.485
I can't stay here, Willow.
Spent way too much time
in hospitals. We don't click.

10:53.519 --> 10:56.623
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll
all get along just fine.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.658
(panting)

11:07.100 --> 11:08.434
(grunts)

11:11.203 --> 11:12.371
(punch lands)

11:21.514 --> 11:23.884
What you wanna do
to her, vamp, huh?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.885
Something like this?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.926
Nice punch
you got there.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.894
Let me guess.
Leather pants,

11:34.927 --> 11:37.663
nice right cross,
doe eyes,

11:37.697 --> 11:40.834
holier-than-thou glower--
you must be Faith.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.203
Oh, goody, I'm famous.
No. Told
you were comin'.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.673
Bit of
a misunderstanding here.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.209
I'm--
Spike. Yeah,
we've met before.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.610
We have?
I don't think we--

11:51.644 --> 11:54.581
Bloody hell,
what are you doing?
I'm on your side.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.716
Yeah? Maybe you haven't heard.
I've reformed.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.754
So have I.
I reformed way before
you did.

12:02.654 --> 12:05.591
Stop... hitting... me!

12:05.625 --> 12:08.761
-We're on the same side.
-Please. Do you think
I'm stupid?

12:08.796 --> 12:11.230
Well, yeah.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.631
You were attacking
that girl.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.806
Sorry, Faith.
I didn't realize
that was you.

12:18.838 --> 12:22.308
It's all right, B.
Luckily you still punch
like you used to.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.713
-You okay?
-Yeah. Terrific.

12:27.746 --> 12:31.250
You're protecting vampires?
Are you the bad Slayer now?

12:31.283 --> 12:35.422
-Am I the good Slayer now?
-He's with me. He has a soul.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.256
-Oh, he's like Angel?
-No.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.225
-BUFFY: Sort of.
-I am nothing like Angel.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.763
He fights on my side,
which is more than I can say
for some of us.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.533
Yeah, well, if he's so good,
what's he doing chasing down
defenseless--

12:48.301 --> 12:51.270
-That's one of the bad guys.
-You should make them
wear signs.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.714
May I? Thanks.

13:06.052 --> 13:09.788
Angel's dull as
a table lamp. And we have
very different coloring.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.792
Okay, catching up.
Anything else I gotta know?

13:14.660 --> 13:16.729
Nice to have you back.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.269
Whoa, memory lane.
Same old house.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.638
Yeah, well, every piece
of furniture has been destroyed
and replaced since you left,

13:25.672 --> 13:27.774
so, actually, new house.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.208
DAWN: Buffy?

13:31.411 --> 13:34.014
BUFFY: We have a new houseguest.

13:34.047 --> 13:38.217
Hey, got a spare bed
for a wanted fugitive?

13:38.250 --> 13:40.320
Hello, Faith.
Huh.

13:40.352 --> 13:44.224
Huh. I guess "wanted"
wasn't really accurate.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.192
DAWN: Does she have
to stay here?

13:46.225 --> 13:49.328
'Cause there's
some nice hotels that welcome
try-to-kill-your-sister types.

13:49.361 --> 13:52.231
Check it out.
Brat's all woman-sized.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.301
Look. I need to get
to the hospital.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.536
Some girl was attacked
on her way into town.
She think she might be a--

13:56.568 --> 13:58.837
We know.
Willow's been calling.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.573
She's still there.
She's gonna call
if the girl wakes up.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.076
Fine.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.150
Well, Faith,
so we better, um,

14:11.183 --> 14:14.421
see if we can find someplace
to squeeze you in for the night.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.563
Not all that tension
was about you.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.567
Giles was part of a plan
to kill me.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.869
For Buffy's own good.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.740
Well, that makes me
feel better about me.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.210
Worse about Giles.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.745
Kinda shaky about you.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.186
Drink of this,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.154
for it is my blood.

14:52.591 --> 14:56.729
You know, I always loved
the story of the Last Supper.

14:56.763 --> 15:02.068
The body and blood of Christ
becoming rich red wine.

15:02.101 --> 15:05.371
I recall as a boy, though,
I couldn't help but think,

15:05.404 --> 15:09.375
"What would happen
if you were at the Last Supper
and you ordered the white?"

15:09.408 --> 15:13.446
A nice oaky chardonnay
or white zin?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.815
I mean, would he make that
out of his lymph or some-all?

15:18.350 --> 15:20.287
Never did bring it up.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.124
Suppose there was a reason
why I never spent too long

15:24.157 --> 15:25.958
in one parish.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.828
Just looking for answers.

15:29.861 --> 15:34.433
Just looking for the Lord
in the wrong damn places.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.269
And then you showed me
the light.

15:39.871 --> 15:41.607
FIRST/BUFFY: Do you
think I'm God?

15:44.610 --> 15:48.681
I certainly do not.
I am beyond concepts like that.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.018
But you still wear
the outfit.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.653
Man can't turn his back
on what he come from.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.922
Besides, black is slimming.
Everyone knows that.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.625
Well, how do you like
what I'm wearing?

16:00.527 --> 16:03.996
Just another dirty girl.
And since you only dress up
in dead folk,

16:04.030 --> 16:06.966
I'm guessing one who's
already been paid her wage.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.037
Look hard.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.306
What do you see?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.576
Strength.

16:19.145 --> 16:23.883
And the loneliness
that comes with real strength.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.486
Nothing about my pert
and bouncy hairdo?

16:30.822 --> 16:34.494
-You're her.
-The Slayer.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.597
At long last.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.139
All this time...

16:47.173 --> 16:48.908
all the work
I've done for you--

16:48.941 --> 16:51.244
blowin' up the council,

16:51.278 --> 16:55.682
organizing
the Ray Charles Brigade
and sticking all them splits.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.120
You never showed me.
Well, you've earned it.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.990
And you'll be
meeting her soon.
Am I right?

17:05.022 --> 17:07.925
Oh, yeah, yeah,
she'll get the message.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.063
And what makes you
so sure she'll come?

17:10.096 --> 17:11.998
Curiosity.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.902
A woman's first sin.
I offer her an apple.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.868
What can she do
but take it?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.442
I'll see you soon.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.421
ANDREW: Faith.
 Her name alone invokes awe.

17:34.453 --> 17:37.589
Faith. A set of principles
 or beliefs

17:37.624 --> 17:40.058
upon which you're
 willing to devote your life.

17:40.093 --> 17:45.865
The dark Slayer.
 A lethal combination
 of beauty, power, and death.

17:45.897 --> 17:49.969
For years and years,
 or to be more accurate, months,

17:50.001 --> 17:54.207
Faith fought
 on the side of good,
 terrorizing the evil community.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.576
But like so many
 tragic heroes,

17:56.608 --> 18:00.547
Faith was seduced
 by the lure of the dark side.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.780
She wrapped evil around her

18:01.814 --> 18:04.951
like a large evil
 Mexican serape.

18:04.983 --> 18:08.621
She became
 a cold-blooded killer.

18:08.654 --> 18:12.057
Nobody was immune
 to her trail of destruction.

18:12.090 --> 18:17.130
Not friends, not family,
 not even the most pacifist
 and logical of races.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.277
AMANDA: What the hell
are you talking about?

18:30.309 --> 18:32.845
I thought Faith killed
a volcanologist.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.748
(chuckles)

18:35.781 --> 18:40.619
Silly... silly... Amanda.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.656
Why would Faith kill a person
who studies Vulcans?

18:46.659 --> 18:50.363
He studied volcanoes.
He was a professor?

18:50.396 --> 18:55.968
Ah, yes.
Well, regardless.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.337
I thought you
weren't supposed to
be doing this anymore.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.640
Making up stories?
I'm not.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.942
This is true.

19:02.974 --> 19:07.213
Except for that possible
word misunderstanding.

19:08.748 --> 19:12.484
There are--
there are things
you need to know about.

19:14.354 --> 19:18.325
Faith has a history
not to be taken lightly.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.894
She's a killer.
Never forget that.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.365
You must stay on guard
around Faith at all times.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.500
Your very lives
may depend on it.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.205
(in Chinese)

19:35.173 --> 19:38.944
(chattering)
(bell rings)

19:44.550 --> 19:47.886
You look better.
No, I don't.

19:48.887 --> 19:52.858
No, you don't.
But I'll be okay.

19:52.892 --> 19:56.929
Unless, of course,
you start beating
up on me now.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.566
I won't.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.768
Well, I thought about it.
I made some doodles.

20:03.935 --> 20:06.705
As far as I'm concerned,
we're on even ground.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.277
I meant what I said.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.112
I don't have time
for your vendetta.

20:13.144 --> 20:14.681
But I need you
in this fight.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.349
I want you on my side.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.386
Thanks.
That means a lot.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.555
So, we're good?

20:24.155 --> 20:26.292
-Absolutely.
-(sighs)

20:26.326 --> 20:28.694
-You're fired.
-What?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.196
Effective immediately.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.432
You're firing me?

20:33.465 --> 20:36.568
Wha-- I just refrained
from kicking your ass.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.204
Buffy, there's
nothing here for you.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.772
I mean, people
are leaving town.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.942
Half the kids don't even
bother showing up anymore.

20:42.974 --> 20:46.645
You've got things
to deal with that are
much worse than anything here.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.948
Look at the big picture.
Right.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.318
The big picture.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.953
The one with the big war
and all the dead little girls.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.190
Not dead. Not dead.
Not if you get them ready.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.730
I don't want to
lead them into war.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.597
It can't be the right thing.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.000
Most wars aren't,
you know?

21:08.034 --> 21:11.570
Some of these girls
haven't even been tested
in battle.

21:11.604 --> 21:16.142
Then, I guess,
maybe you should test them.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.810
Couldn't I just come
to work part-time?

21:18.845 --> 21:21.513
I could make fliers
for encounter groups and post
them up all over the school.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.282
And you're fired again.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.622
Remember, Buffy,
the mission's what matters.

21:32.223 --> 21:34.326
(door opens)
(girls giggling)

21:40.199 --> 21:42.034
(sighs)

21:48.875 --> 21:51.009
SPIKE: You craving a moment
alone in the dank?

21:51.042 --> 21:53.980
-Or can I bum one?
-(chuckles)

21:56.749 --> 21:59.117
Well, I guess you can
smoke all you want.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.020
Big "C"
not really an issue?

22:02.054 --> 22:07.058
Teeth get yellow
after an eternity.
Gotta watch that.

22:08.059 --> 22:10.061
Huh.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.836
Right. It's not
what it looks like.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.305
Hey, to each
his own, man.

22:19.337 --> 22:21.973
This one guy I ran with,
he liked me to dress up
like a schoolgirl

22:22.008 --> 22:24.210
and take this friggin' bullwhip,
and I'd be like--

22:24.242 --> 22:26.979
I got dangerous
for a while.

22:27.012 --> 22:31.817
-Was this before the soul
or after?
-After, but I got over it.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.886
In case you're feeling
all dust-happy again
after your long incarceration.

22:34.921 --> 22:38.590
Well, not if you're
all repenty.
Takes the fun out of it.

22:40.893 --> 22:44.262
(girls laughing)
(clattering, glass breaks)

22:44.296 --> 22:46.833
(stretches)
no more Starbucks
for the wannabes, man.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.336
They've been spazzing
for, like, hours.
Yeah.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.270
It does get a bit much
up there.

22:52.304 --> 22:55.173
They're good girls.
Just green, is all.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.109
So, why aren't you
up there, imparting?

22:58.144 --> 23:01.681
That's Buffy's thing.
Anyway, I just spent
a good stretch of time

23:01.713 --> 23:03.715
locked away with
a mess of female types.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.285
-Kinda had my fill.
-Hm.

23:06.317 --> 23:09.355
But you waited until
Angel needed your help
to bust out of jail.

23:09.387 --> 23:13.058
Three squares,
a nice weight room,
movie every third Sunday.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.428
-It could have been worse.
-What movie?

23:15.461 --> 23:17.163
The last one was Glitter.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.900
I guess it couldn't
have been worse.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.536
You had the power
to walk away anytime.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.136
Nothing to stop you.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.906
I stopped me.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.477
I got dangerous
for a while.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.981
You over it?

23:36.015 --> 23:37.884
More or less.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.319
I pull for
the good guys now.
What's the less?

23:41.353 --> 23:44.723
-The usual stuff.
-Such as?

23:44.757 --> 23:47.993
I was thinking about
looking up the guy
with the bullwhip.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.998
Long incarceration.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.737
You could do better.
Schoolgirl thing's old hat.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.771
It's all old hat, man.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.340
Every guy's got
some wack fantasy.

24:02.374 --> 24:05.344
Scratch the surface
of any granola-type dude,

24:05.376 --> 24:07.980
naughty nurses
and horny cheerleaders.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.782
-I figure if you
can't beat 'em--
-Join 'em.

24:10.817 --> 24:14.787
-Just don't forget who's on top.
-That I suspect would be you.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.888
You got that right.

24:21.661 --> 24:24.363
I've met you before,
you know.

24:24.395 --> 24:27.799
Mm. Yeah, you made
a great impression
on my chin.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.169
Not in the graveyard.
Before that.

24:30.201 --> 24:34.039
I was kind of wearing
a different body.
Really?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.142
You seemed okay with it.

24:38.911 --> 24:42.181
The body swap,
with Buffy.

24:44.215 --> 24:47.886
She fill you in
on that whole deal?
She told me it went down.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.288
Failed to mention
who was driving
her skin around.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.324
I may have said
a few things.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.894
Like you could
ride me at a gallop
till my knees buckled.

24:54.926 --> 24:59.131
Squeeze me till I pop
like warm champagne.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.133
It's not the kind of thing
a man forgets.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.703
Should have known
it wasn't Blondie
behind the wheel.

25:04.737 --> 25:08.007
-She'd never throw down
like that.
-Oh, you have been away.

25:08.039 --> 25:12.044
Don't even tell me
little miss tightly wound's
been getting her naughty on?

25:12.077 --> 25:15.247
-Not of late.
-Wow.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.784
Everybody's just
full of surprises.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.721
Hey, B.

25:23.422 --> 25:26.458
Well, it's nice
to see you two
getting along so well.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.196
Yeah. Uh, you just know
all the cool vampires.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.933
-Yeah.
-Hey, aren't you usually
at work about now?

25:34.967 --> 25:37.469
I kinda decided
to cut back on my hours.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.272
(door opens)
DAWN: Buffy, is that you?

25:41.307 --> 25:43.675
Down here.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.113
Figured I'd be better off
focusing on what's going on
around here.

25:47.145 --> 25:50.115
Buffy, Willow just called
from the hospital.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.585
The girl's awake.

25:55.121 --> 25:58.857
He was a minister,
or something.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.093
At least he dressed
like one.

26:02.929 --> 26:07.165
I thought he was trying to
save me, at first.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.301
He-- He picked you up
on the side of the road?

26:11.671 --> 26:13.105
Bringers were chasing me.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.576
He said
they were his boys.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.749
Right before he burned me.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.958
(camera beeps)

26:35.161 --> 26:37.328
He wanted to
tell you something.

26:37.363 --> 26:41.599
Before he cut me,

26:42.934 --> 26:45.270
he told me to give
the Slayer a message.

26:49.141 --> 26:53.244
-What is it?
-He said,

26:53.278 --> 26:55.781
"I have something of yours."

27:01.053 --> 27:04.589
We've got a new player in town.
Dresses like a preacher.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.659
Calls himself Caleb.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.661
Looks like he's working
for The First.

27:08.694 --> 27:12.964
He's taunting us,
calling us out.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.601
Says he's got
something of mine.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.204
Could be another girl.
Could be something else.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.374
Don't know.
Don't care.

27:22.407 --> 27:25.144
I'm tired of talking.
I'm tired of training.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.448
He's got something of mine?
Fine.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.450
I'm getting it back.

27:31.482 --> 27:34.721
And you guys
are coming with me.

27:47.598 --> 27:51.837
CALEB: You're searching
for something, girl.
What would that be now?

27:51.871 --> 27:55.907
Oh, you.
I was looking for you.

27:55.942 --> 27:58.076
That right?

27:58.109 --> 28:01.346
I heard you speaking
tonight. Preachin'.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.915
I felt your words
go straight to me.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.419
Well, the truth is like
a sword, isn't it, girl?
It cuts deep.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.721
Mm. Yeah.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.090
The words I use
got a power to 'em.

28:12.124 --> 28:16.494
Power now.
They're not just words.
They're truth.

28:16.528 --> 28:20.031
They brought me here.
They called you.

28:21.232 --> 28:24.103
Know why?
Because you're human.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.306
You got your urges.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.643
A woman's got hers.
A man's got his.

28:33.244 --> 28:36.448
Our whole race
can be so damnably weak.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.917
And that's why
we seek the strength,

28:39.986 --> 28:42.387
the power.

28:42.421 --> 28:46.759
It's not wrong
to be drawn to the power,
is it, Preacher?

28:46.792 --> 28:50.061
Oh, no, child.
It's not wrong.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.066
(girl gasps)

28:57.769 --> 28:59.238
Just human.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.474
(sighs)

29:05.076 --> 29:09.448
Oh. Most people don't like
visits from their dead,
you know.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.250
Heathens.
No appreciation
for life's pleasures.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.819
Do it again.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.721
I take requests.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.757
One of those Potentials
you killed perhaps.

29:18.790 --> 29:23.796
No. Save them for later.
I'm in more of an old
memory lane kind of mood.

29:23.829 --> 29:27.933
Back before I met you,
there was this choir girl
in Knoxville

29:27.967 --> 29:30.469
I used to give
singing lessons to.

29:30.501 --> 29:34.006
Oh, she even
screamed on-key.
Show me her.

29:35.273 --> 29:39.077
All these girls,
they followed you willingly.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.280
-You tricked them.
-I only told them the truth.

29:42.314 --> 29:46.585
As for following,
well, that seems to be
what they do best.

29:46.617 --> 29:50.189
We need to start arming
the girls. I wanna be ready
to move when we find him.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.157
We don't even know
where we're going.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.660
That's why I figured
we'd do a little recon first.
You up for it?

29:54.692 --> 29:57.864
-Point me where you want me.
-And you're certain this is
the best course of action.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.266
You don't even know
what this man has of yours.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.367
If he, in fact,
has anything.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.670
It could be a girl.
A Potential trying
to get to us.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.038
It could be a stapler.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.441
-I'm going in anyway.
-With the girls?

30:09.474 --> 30:11.376
Most of whom have yet
to be in the field,

30:11.410 --> 30:13.612
let alone in
a life-or-death situation.

30:13.644 --> 30:16.949
Then it's time we test them.
Look, I'll just take the ones
that have been here the longest.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.885
-The rest can stay behind.
-Could be that's just
what he wants you to do.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.554
-The old bait and switch.
-Yeah, he lures us away

30:22.587 --> 30:24.990
and then kills the girls
we leave behind.

30:25.023 --> 30:29.161
I know.
That's why I need you
to stay here with them.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.864
You're my most powerful
weapon, Wil.

30:31.897 --> 30:34.500
I know you can keep them safe
if anything happens.

30:34.532 --> 30:38.203
An unknown man
breezes into town,
says he has something of yours.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.806
Buffy, this thing's got "trap"
written all over it.

30:40.838 --> 30:43.308
He won't be expecting
a full attack,
not this soon.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.478
-That's why we have to move.
-We know nothing about this man.

30:46.511 --> 30:50.082
We cannot go
into battle unprepared.
We have to have more time.

30:50.115 --> 30:54.353
Giles, we don't have time,
and you're not
going into battle.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.822
I need you to stay behind
with the others.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.959
Help the girls
who still need a teacher.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.566
FAITH: No eyes,
but look at him go.

31:07.598 --> 31:09.667
They got sonar
or something?

31:09.701 --> 31:13.872
Or something I guess.
Pretty good when they attack.

31:13.905 --> 31:16.407
They just roam free
around town?

31:16.442 --> 31:18.544
Well, normally,
they show up out of nowhere,

31:18.576 --> 31:22.080
and then either
stab or get stabbed,
and then they run off.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.916
Looks like this guy
wants to be found.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.952
Adds weight to the whole
"it's a trap" theory.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.721
I am through waiting around
for people to attack us.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.657
Hey, I'm with you.
Drop me in the hornets' nest.
What the hell.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.762
(sighs)

31:37.796 --> 31:39.631
You got
a rough sitch here,

31:39.664 --> 31:43.068
trying to turn
a bunch of little girls
into an army.

31:43.102 --> 31:47.405
They're Potential Slayers,
just like we were.

31:47.439 --> 31:50.776
Right. Maybe they'll do
as good as us.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.310
They're getting better.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.447
I'll work with them.
Some of them
seem real eager.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.250
Fashion disasters?
Yeah. But they're
ready to fight.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.885
Why did you come back?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.255
Willow said
you needed me.

32:03.288 --> 32:05.257
Didn't give it
a lot of thought.
Do you--

32:05.290 --> 32:09.260
Am I getting you want me
to be not here?

32:09.295 --> 32:11.930
No. That's not
what I meant.

32:13.531 --> 32:16.934
(sighs)
I'm glad that you're here.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.805
It's good.
Thank you.

32:19.837 --> 32:22.141
No problem.

32:22.173 --> 32:25.010
You know me,
all about the good deeds.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.948
Willow said
you helped out Angel.

32:29.981 --> 32:32.117
Yeah.
He says hi.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.354
Really?
Sure.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.025
How is he?

32:39.057 --> 32:42.627
Better. I had to do
this whole magical
mind-walk with him.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.497
-You were in Angel's mind?
-Buffy.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.935
What is this place?
Look.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.204
There's more of them.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.207
FAITH: I think we just found
our hornets' nest.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.210
Let's get the cavalry.

32:58.243 --> 33:01.946
Now, remember,
we're looking for
killing blows only, people.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.550
So chest and throat,
if it's a vampire.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.987
Stomach, chest, and face
if it's a Bringer.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.457
What if it's something else?
Could happen.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.392
Something otherworldly.

33:13.424 --> 33:16.994
And here's a handy rule.
Don't go for
the flashy tentacles

33:17.028 --> 33:19.897
just because
they're waving them about,
trying to get attention.

33:19.931 --> 33:25.203
Go for the center--
brain, heart, eyes.
Everything's got eyes.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.006
-DAWN: Except the Bringers.
-Except the Bringers.

33:28.039 --> 33:32.211
I don't want there
to be tentacles.
I'm not good with squishy.

33:32.243 --> 33:35.080
I don't care
if it's Godzilla.
I wanna get in this thing.

33:35.114 --> 33:39.317
Godzilla is mostly
Tokyo-based, so he's
probably a no-show.

33:39.351 --> 33:43.855
Besides, Matthew Broderick
can kill Godzilla.
How tough is he?

33:43.888 --> 33:48.227
Xander?
Matthew Broderick
did not kill Godzilla.

33:48.259 --> 33:51.497
He killed the big,
dumb lizard that was not
the real Godzilla.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.599
You people
are even crazier than her.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.269
Than who?
Buffy, man.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.672
I mean, taking us
right into the bad guy's lair?

34:00.705 --> 34:04.576
Well, that's where,
generally speaking,
you'd go to find the bad guy.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.178
And I don't think
you came here
to fight plaque.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.514
No, I came here
for protection.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.614
Well, you signed on
to fight with--
Look. I know.

34:10.648 --> 34:13.684
But this plan
is trouble.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.753
Okay? Buffy doesn't care
how many of us
she puts in danger.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.289
Let me tell you something
about Buffy.

34:18.324 --> 34:21.626
-In fact, you should
all listen to this.
-Uh, we kinda were.

34:21.659 --> 34:25.297
I've been through
more battles with Buffy
than you all can ever imagine.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.867
She stopped everything
that's ever come up against her.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.938
She's laid down her life,
literally, to protect
the people around her.

34:33.972 --> 34:37.742
This girl has died two times.
And she's still standing.

34:37.775 --> 34:41.447
You're scared? That's smart.
You got questions? You should.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.617
But you doubt her motives,
you think Buffy's
all about the kill,

34:45.650 --> 34:48.219
then you take
the little bus to battle.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.123
I've seen her heart,
and this time not literally,

34:51.157 --> 34:54.826
and I'm telling you right now,
she cares more about your lives
than you will ever know.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.262
You gotta trust her.

34:58.996 --> 35:01.766
She's earned it.

35:04.869 --> 35:08.407
Damn. I never knew
you were that cool.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.342
Well, you always were
a little slow.
I get that now.

35:11.376 --> 35:14.445
All right, let's saddle up.

35:30.228 --> 35:32.697
Okay, set up a perimeter.
Guard the door.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.865
I don't want anything
getting in behind us.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.836
My team goes in first.
We check the place out.
You guys are our safety net.

35:38.869 --> 35:42.641
If this place is a trap,
we give the signal, you guys
come in, guns a-blazing.

35:42.673 --> 35:44.141
So, what's the signal?

35:44.175 --> 35:47.313
-I'm thinking
lots and lots of yelling.
-Got it.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.146
Shall we?

36:08.666 --> 36:10.969
What is this place?

36:11.001 --> 36:14.572
-Looks like an old vineyard.
-An evil vineyard, huh?

36:14.606 --> 36:17.208
Like Falcon Crest.

36:17.242 --> 36:20.246
Stay alert, you guys.
Bringers are here somewhere.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.813
Just need to
find out where.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.849
SPIKE: Shouldn't be too hard.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.726
Well, now.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.030
You girls are just burning
with righteousness, aren't you?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.400
Problem is, you think
you're blazing like suns,

37:14.432 --> 37:18.903
when really you're
burning like matchsticks
in the face of the darkness.

37:18.936 --> 37:22.307
You having fun?
Now, I hope my boys
haven't worn you out too much.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.809
I need you fit
for when I purify you.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.646
Save the sermon, Padre.
I heard you have
something of mine.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.748
Well, I do now.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.717
You liked my little message,
did you?

37:32.751 --> 37:35.085
You know, I ruined
a perfectly good knife
on that girl.

37:35.119 --> 37:39.724
Got her soiled blood
all over the place.
I may need to get a new truck.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.927
So, you're the Slayer.

37:41.960 --> 37:47.465
The Slayer.
The strongest, the fastest,
the most aflame,

37:47.498 --> 37:52.338
with that most precious
invention of all mankind--
the notion of goodness.

37:54.172 --> 37:57.376
Well, the Slayer must
indeed be powerful.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.115
So, what else you got?

38:10.521 --> 38:12.324
(roars)

38:25.135 --> 38:26.304
KENNEDY: Let's go!

38:29.840 --> 38:31.141
Kennedy!

38:34.545 --> 38:38.684
Miss, I do believe
you have your own problems
you should be worried about.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.818
(bones crack)

38:40.851 --> 38:43.188
(laughing)

38:48.226 --> 38:52.063
-(groans)
-CALEB: Oh, good.
There's more of you.

38:54.164 --> 38:55.534
Buffy!

38:58.335 --> 39:01.572
Well, you're
the other one, aren't you?
The Cain to her Abel?

39:01.606 --> 39:03.742
No offense meant
to Cain, of course.

39:11.115 --> 39:14.485
-Never was much
for the good book.
-Oh, it has its moments.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.887
Paul has some good stuff,
for instance.

39:16.922 --> 39:20.090
But overall,
I find it a tad complicated.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.726
I like to
keep things simple.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.264
Good folk, bad folk.

39:29.099 --> 39:32.369
Clean folk, dirty folk.
(bones crack)

39:34.706 --> 39:37.443
-No!
-Yes.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.545
Xander.
Buffy.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.813
Get them out of here.
We have to retreat.
Do it!

39:59.063 --> 40:02.067
What can I say?
I work in mysterious ways.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.507
Also some fairly
straightforward ones.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.951
We are leaving.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.690
Are you okay?
Let's go. Come on.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.427
Let's go! Come on!

40:31.295 --> 40:34.132
You're the one
who sees everything,
aren't you?

40:34.164 --> 40:35.833
Well, let's see
what we can't do about that.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.505
(yelling)

40:40.672 --> 40:41.773
Xander!

40:43.641 --> 40:46.210
Come on. Get up.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.289
CALEB: Now,
 it's a simple story.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.958
Stop me if you've heard it.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.530
I have found
 and truly believe

41:04.563 --> 41:08.500
that there's nothing so bad,
 it cannot be made better
 with a story.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.574
And this one's got
 a happy ending.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.378
There once was a woman.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.114
And she was foul,
 like all women.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.016
For Adam's rib was dirty,
 just like Adam himself.

41:26.050 --> 41:29.086
For what was he, but human.

41:32.690 --> 41:35.561
But this woman,
 she was filled...

41:35.594 --> 41:37.829
with darkness and despair.

41:37.862 --> 41:43.300
And why?
 Because she did not know.
 She could not see.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.402
She didn't know
the good news.

41:45.436 --> 41:50.141
The glory that was coming?
That'd be you.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.911
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory are yours,

41:53.945 --> 41:56.748
now and forever.

41:56.782 --> 41:59.818
You show up,
they'll get in line.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.987
Because they followed her.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.856
And all they have to do
 is take one more step,

42:04.889 --> 42:07.826
and I'll kill them all.

42:07.858 --> 42:11.228
