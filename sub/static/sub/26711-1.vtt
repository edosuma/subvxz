03:15.584 --> 03:16.417
No.

03:21.815 --> 03:22.648
Ugh.

03:31.981 --> 03:32.814
Ugh.

03:34.613 --> 03:35.446
Okay.

03:36.726 --> 03:38.393
I think it's passed.

03:39.286 --> 03:43.310
- I am so sorry about
that restaurant choice.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.651
- No, it's not like you could have known.

03:45.701 --> 03:47.174
- I didn't see they failed
the health inspection

03:47.224 --> 03:48.646
until we were on the way out.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.116
I mean they really gotta
make those signs bigger

03:50.166 --> 03:53.409
or put a giant red X
on the door, something.

03:53.459 --> 03:54.764
- Okay, it's fine.

03:54.814 --> 03:55.899
It's really like...

03:55.949 --> 03:59.699
The ice cream is sort
of settling my stomach.

04:07.341 --> 04:09.126
What are you doing?

04:09.176 --> 04:10.050
- Kissing you.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.452
- Why?

04:11.502 --> 04:13.076
- We're on a date.

04:13.126 --> 04:15.793
- It's the first and I feel ill.

04:17.463 --> 04:18.463
- I'm sorry.

04:19.368 --> 04:20.201
- Yeah.

04:21.064 --> 04:23.675
It's okay, just take it easy.

04:23.725 --> 04:27.341
Geez, you're a really
different sort of guy.

04:27.391 --> 04:29.062
- Different.

04:29.112 --> 04:31.220
I can work with different.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.492
- I should go.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.116
- Oh, really.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.499
Was it the whole kiss thing?

04:37.639 --> 04:38.862
- No.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.346
Maybe.

04:40.396 --> 04:41.830
Yes.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.622
I just really wanna go.

04:43.672 --> 04:44.505
- Okay.

04:45.464 --> 04:48.580
- So.

04:48.630 --> 04:50.398
Are you sick now too?

04:50.448 --> 04:51.910
- Just right now?

04:51.960 --> 04:54.460
Oh, I should be so lucky.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.093
- What do you mean?

04:57.713 --> 04:58.546
- Cancer.

05:02.641 --> 05:03.474
- Oh.

05:05.119 --> 05:06.702
Wow, I had no idea.

05:08.020 --> 05:11.020
- Soon, I'll have none of this left.

05:12.175 --> 05:13.581
- We were at lunch for two hours,

05:13.631 --> 05:14.464
I mean,

05:15.494 --> 05:17.333
why didn't you say anything?

05:17.383 --> 05:18.356
- I don't wanna spend what little time

05:18.406 --> 05:22.073
I have left letting
myself be defined by it.

05:24.774 --> 05:26.357
- You are so brave.

05:35.288 --> 05:38.043
Don't die, don't die, don't die,

05:38.093 --> 05:40.760
don't die, don't die, don't die!

05:45.368 --> 05:46.618
- Okay, cheers.

05:47.455 --> 05:49.538
- I broke my cold streak.

05:51.009 --> 05:52.938
- Congratulations man,
I knew you could do it.

05:52.988 --> 05:53.821
- Yeah.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.925
- I want details, details.

05:58.975 --> 05:59.975
- So I meet her online.

06:00.025 --> 06:01.924
And to start, it's not going great,

06:01.974 --> 06:02.757
but,--

06:02.807 --> 06:05.085
- But, my man turned it around right?

06:05.135 --> 06:06.359
- Exactly, exactly.
- Yes.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.151
- Now she is not grooving it.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.294
But after I tell her I have cancer,

06:13.314 --> 06:14.231
in the bag.

06:16.997 --> 06:18.754
- You have cancer?

06:18.804 --> 06:19.845
- What, no!

06:19.895 --> 06:20.678
God no.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.761
Don't you think I would of told you that?

06:23.811 --> 06:26.310
- Why the hell did you
tell her you had it?

06:26.360 --> 06:28.677
- Taylor, come on man, at this point,

06:28.727 --> 06:31.942
what else do I have going for me?

06:31.992 --> 06:35.158
- Cancer is not something
you have going for you.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.275
Cancer is a bad thing okay.

06:37.325 --> 06:40.344
You don't joke about cancer man.

06:40.394 --> 06:41.644
- Yes, yes, but

06:43.037 --> 06:45.084
do we blame people for their cancer

06:45.134 --> 06:49.301
or, or do we take pity on
them for having it, huh?

06:51.392 --> 06:53.059
Yes, now you get it.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.081
- Okay.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.381
Let me get this straight.

06:57.431 --> 07:00.435
So you're at a spot in your social life

07:00.485 --> 07:02.772
where you're actively
going online to meet girls,

07:02.822 --> 07:05.333
not to take on a normal date,

07:05.383 --> 07:09.085
but to trick them into a pity screw?

07:09.135 --> 07:10.385
- Uh huh, yeah.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.971
- And you see nothing
wrong with this whatsoever?

07:14.021 --> 07:15.413
- It's not illegal.

07:15.463 --> 07:16.883
I didn't hurt the girl.

07:16.933 --> 07:18.479
- Okay, but what about you?

07:18.529 --> 07:21.226
Don't you find it unhealthy for you?

07:21.276 --> 07:23.813
- I think not scoring period,

07:23.863 --> 07:25.818
is even less healthy.

07:25.868 --> 07:27.427
- Oh my god.

07:27.477 --> 07:30.955
I have clearly failed in my duty to you

07:31.005 --> 07:32.730
on so many levels, I'm sorry.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.036
- Taylor, come on man, don't mourn,

07:34.086 --> 07:35.854
you gotta be happy for me.

07:35.904 --> 07:37.912
I found my niche.

07:37.962 --> 07:40.334
Alright look, you were hands down

07:40.384 --> 07:41.956
the best storm captain.

07:42.006 --> 07:43.295
I remember frosh week

07:43.345 --> 07:45.674
practically crying because I didn't fit

07:45.724 --> 07:48.209
into any of those frat openers.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.416
Okay, and you just said--

07:49.466 --> 07:50.857
- "This is not your scene man,

07:50.907 --> 07:52.847
"go find your niche."

07:52.897 --> 07:54.624
Fine okay, I did say that,

07:54.674 --> 07:57.733
but I said that to all the dorks.

07:57.783 --> 07:59.197
I'm sorry, but it's true.

07:59.247 --> 08:01.191
I say the same thing to
the new guys in sales.

08:01.241 --> 08:02.729
- Yeah and you were right.

08:02.779 --> 08:06.817
Different approaches for different guys.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.886
- This is not a niche okay.

08:08.936 --> 08:10.793
This is sick and weird.

08:10.843 --> 08:12.965
And besides, it's not sustainable.

08:13.015 --> 08:14.141
- What do you mean?

08:14.191 --> 08:15.303
- Well how do you expect to continue

08:15.353 --> 08:17.009
this relationship with this girl?

08:17.059 --> 08:18.536
- Come on.

08:18.586 --> 08:21.253
There is no way she doesn't see me again.

08:21.303 --> 08:23.605
You can't say no to cancer guy.

08:23.655 --> 08:25.032
She'd feel terrible.

08:25.082 --> 08:26.279
- Okay, fine.

08:26.329 --> 08:28.000
She's gonna go on a couple
more dates with you,

08:28.050 --> 08:30.605
but eventually, she's gonna wanna know

08:30.655 --> 08:32.928
how your treatment is progressing.

08:32.977 --> 08:35.056
- I tell her I'm in remission.

08:35.106 --> 08:35.889
- Oh my god--

08:35.938 --> 08:37.408
- At that point, she's stuck with me.

08:37.457 --> 08:38.375
I'm around.

08:39.347 --> 08:41.693
- But she's gonna meet
your friends, your family.

08:41.743 --> 08:42.525
She's gonna meet me.

08:42.576 --> 08:44.729
I'm sure as hell not
going along with this lie.

08:44.779 --> 08:49.612
She is going to find out and
it's gonna be over like that.

08:50.939 --> 08:53.368
- You are missing the whole point here.

08:53.418 --> 08:55.343
Okay, I am 29 years old.

08:55.393 --> 09:00.241
I have never been in a
relationship longer than six weeks.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.791
I have very modest goals here.

09:05.809 --> 09:08.976
- Did you cut out a part of your hair?

09:11.647 --> 09:12.480
Really?

09:13.395 --> 09:14.228
Really?

09:21.627 --> 09:22.544
- Awe shit.

09:23.531 --> 09:24.489
- What is it?

09:24.539 --> 09:28.129
- "John, you're about to
have the battle of your life.

09:28.179 --> 09:29.877
"My cousin died from cancer last year

09:29.927 --> 09:32.541
"and it tore me apart.

09:32.591 --> 09:36.078
"I'm so sorry, but I can't
be a part of your journey.

09:36.128 --> 09:38.728
"I can't do that to myself again.

09:38.778 --> 09:42.017
"I feel so terrible but
that's the way it is.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.929
"Wishing you good health, Amy."

09:44.979 --> 09:45.812
- You see?

09:46.871 --> 09:48.976
- Shit man, I thought,

09:49.026 --> 09:51.313
I thought women liked broken guys?

09:51.363 --> 09:53.091
- They do, but it has

09:53.141 --> 09:55.611
to be a guy that they can actually fix.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.011
Unless this girl's an oncologist,

09:57.061 --> 09:59.153
that's just not gonna fly.

09:59.203 --> 10:01.045
- I guess you're right.

10:01.095 --> 10:03.495
That's not gonna work.

10:03.545 --> 10:05.832
- Alright, let's just recap here.

10:05.882 --> 10:07.097
I mean it's what?

10:07.147 --> 10:08.897
10 years beyond frosh

10:10.194 --> 10:12.425
and you are still at the same spot

10:12.475 --> 10:14.400
that you started in man.

10:14.450 --> 10:15.953
- It's not that bad okay,

10:16.003 --> 10:17.509
I have made strides.

10:17.559 --> 10:20.365
I've been with five girls since then.

10:20.415 --> 10:22.673
Well, three for real

10:22.723 --> 10:25.140
and two were just in and out.

10:27.483 --> 10:30.472
- What do you mean just in and out?

10:30.522 --> 10:35.035
That's what you do, you go
in and out a bunch of times.

10:35.085 --> 10:35.868
- Right, yeah, no.

10:35.918 --> 10:37.401
It just wasn't a bunch of times.

10:37.451 --> 10:39.701
It was more kind of like in

10:41.513 --> 10:42.596
and then out.

10:45.067 --> 10:48.993
- So it was just in one time and then out?

10:49.043 --> 10:54.043
It wasn't like in out, in
out, in out, in out, in out?

10:54.098 --> 10:55.265
- Pretty much.

10:57.375 --> 10:58.158
- What did you do?

10:58.208 --> 10:59.704
Did you go in and then get freaked out

10:59.754 --> 11:02.855
and start crying and
run away or something?

11:02.905 --> 11:04.072
- Pretty much.

11:06.795 --> 11:10.807
- Alright, this is not, this is not good.

11:10.857 --> 11:14.040
Okay, here's what you're gonna do okay?

11:14.090 --> 11:17.147
You are going to set a goal.

11:17.197 --> 11:18.912
You, look at me.

11:18.962 --> 11:21.379
You're gonna visualize a path

11:22.251 --> 11:23.448
and then you need to get on that path

11:23.498 --> 11:26.401
and you need to stay on that path.

11:26.451 --> 11:27.928
Okay?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.399
- Okay.

11:29.449 --> 11:31.765
Yeah, well I guess,

11:31.815 --> 11:34.312
I guess I just really want a girlfriend

11:34.362 --> 11:35.768
before I turn 30.

11:35.818 --> 11:37.127
- Okay great, great.

11:37.177 --> 11:39.479
Because you can't have the wife and kids

11:39.529 --> 11:40.510
unless you start there, right?

11:40.560 --> 11:42.361
So, you're on the path.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.601
- Yeah, yeah, it's like
those movies where the guy,

11:44.651 --> 11:46.771
he wants to lose his
virginity before the prom,

11:46.821 --> 11:50.571
except this, this is
the more mature version.

11:51.595 --> 11:55.117
- Yeah, yeah, it's the
more mature version.

11:55.167 --> 11:55.950
- Yeah.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.112
See the problem for me,
the real problem is,

11:58.162 --> 12:01.333
I want the girl, the girl don't want me.

12:01.383 --> 12:02.495
Everything else in my love life

12:02.545 --> 12:04.735
is actually pretty great except

12:04.785 --> 12:07.157
that last little piece, I just,

12:07.207 --> 12:08.793
I can't get over that hurdle.

12:08.843 --> 12:11.063
- You're at a point in
life where people are,

12:11.113 --> 12:13.792
they're very established in who they are.

12:13.842 --> 12:15.781
And once they know that,

12:15.831 --> 12:18.847
hey, they're on their path.

12:18.897 --> 12:22.147
So you gotta ask yourself one question,

12:23.109 --> 12:24.109
who are you?

12:27.002 --> 12:27.919
- Who am I?

12:31.131 --> 12:32.881
Well, my name's John.

12:34.423 --> 12:35.983
- Sure.

12:36.033 --> 12:37.984
- And I want a girlfriend.

13:01.877 --> 13:03.141
Pst, pst, pst.

13:03.191 --> 13:06.210
Hey, go check out that guy
standing around the corner.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.890
- Go check out a guy?

13:07.940 --> 13:09.458
- You know what I'm saying.

13:09.508 --> 13:11.841
Go check out what he's flipping through.

13:11.891 --> 13:12.724
Go.

13:20.638 --> 13:22.015
- 1984.

13:22.065 --> 13:23.937
He's thinking of buying George Orwell.

13:23.987 --> 13:26.203
- Yeah Richard, I know,
I helped him find it.

13:26.253 --> 13:28.077
Doesn't it drive you crazy?

13:28.127 --> 13:30.388
- John, what the hell
are you talking about?

13:30.438 --> 13:31.258
- Alright, look.

13:31.308 --> 13:32.979
How often does this happen?

13:33.029 --> 13:35.398
A dude like that dressed in
his fancy business clothes

13:35.448 --> 13:38.281
walks in here to buy a book we all read

13:38.331 --> 13:39.501
like way back in the day.

13:39.551 --> 13:42.817
Did he seriously not go to high school?

13:42.867 --> 13:44.459
That should be on one of those lists.

13:44.509 --> 13:46.542
You know, on the internet.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.365
- What lists?

13:48.415 --> 13:49.663
- You know, like those blogs.

13:49.713 --> 13:51.371
Top 20 Things Asian Parents Do That Only

13:51.421 --> 13:53.163
Asian Millennials Would Get.

13:53.213 --> 13:53.996
Something like that.

13:54.046 --> 13:57.195
Things that really annoy bookstore staff.

13:57.245 --> 14:00.109
- I know those lists, but
that doesn't annoy me.

14:00.159 --> 14:02.812
The guy wants a book,
this is a book store.

14:02.862 --> 14:05.553
- Oh come on Richard, don't
leave me hanging here.

14:05.603 --> 14:08.647
It is crystal clear that
he was some dumb meathead

14:08.697 --> 14:11.517
who spent all of school getting
drunk and playing football.

14:11.567 --> 14:15.565
And then his daddy gave
him a position at the firm.

14:15.615 --> 14:16.767
Okay, so now all of a sudden,

14:16.817 --> 14:18.699
he waltzes in here and says,

14:18.749 --> 14:21.232
"Gee, I wanna read smart people books."

14:21.282 --> 14:24.133
So he reads 1984, maybe
Catcher In The Rye.

14:24.183 --> 14:25.752
And then he goes to the parties

14:25.802 --> 14:26.699
and he's talking to all these people

14:26.749 --> 14:28.238
like he's the only one on planet earth

14:28.288 --> 14:30.030
that's actually read the book,

14:30.080 --> 14:31.433
and he thinks he's saying these profound

14:31.483 --> 14:32.960
things about it and society.

14:33.010 --> 14:35.427
Meanwhile, meanwhile Richard,

14:36.874 --> 14:39.288
we were all there 10 years ago

14:39.338 --> 14:40.489
but we've gotten over it.

14:40.539 --> 14:41.976
But see, of course you
can't say anything to him,

14:42.026 --> 14:44.757
you just gotta let him go on.

14:44.807 --> 14:47.210
- I think you're being
too hard on the guy John.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.457
- What are you talking about?

14:48.507 --> 14:49.290
This is what we do.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.884
We analyze people's book choices.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.019
- Okay.

14:53.069 --> 14:54.098
Here's my take.

14:54.148 --> 14:56.099
If you're right, which you may not be.

14:56.149 --> 14:57.992
Because he could be rereading it.

14:58.042 --> 15:00.288
He could be buying a copy
for his younger brother,

15:00.338 --> 15:03.200
but if you're right, what's the big deal?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.705
Maybe he realizes he's
missed out on some classics

15:05.755 --> 15:07.288
and now that he has his act together

15:07.338 --> 15:09.248
he wants to spend his time this way.

15:09.298 --> 15:10.939
I don't think most people
would mock him for that.

15:10.989 --> 15:12.578
I think they'd respect it.

15:12.628 --> 15:15.617
- You think that guy has his act together?

15:15.667 --> 15:16.457
- Yeah.

15:16.507 --> 15:18.010
I mean look at him.

15:18.060 --> 15:21.477
He seems confident, he seems established.

15:22.469 --> 15:25.080
- Established, you see
that's what I gotta be.

15:25.130 --> 15:28.509
- Not me man, I'm staying off the grid.

15:28.559 --> 15:30.188
- Look at all these guys
passing by out there.

15:30.238 --> 15:32.261
Same age as me, same background.

15:32.311 --> 15:34.038
But they all work at their firms making

15:34.088 --> 15:35.438
like 70 grand a year doing things

15:35.488 --> 15:36.865
people do in ordinary life that

15:36.915 --> 15:38.955
I don't even know about.

15:39.005 --> 15:42.035
Richard, how did all
these guys suddenly just,

15:42.085 --> 15:43.965
get it together?

15:44.015 --> 15:46.553
- It's the women that do it for them.

15:46.603 --> 15:48.027
They domesticate the man.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.211
The man rises to the woman's standard.

15:50.261 --> 15:51.331
You go to a single guys house,

15:51.381 --> 15:53.765
piss all around the floor near the toilet.

15:53.815 --> 15:55.419
Guy with a girlfriend, no piss.

15:55.469 --> 15:56.252
Why?

15:56.302 --> 15:58.245
Because she either makes
him clean it up every time,

15:58.295 --> 16:00.273
or he pees sitting down.

16:00.323 --> 16:03.019
- Yeah, heard about those guys.

16:03.069 --> 16:04.700
- So if you wanna be an established guy

16:04.750 --> 16:08.075
you have got to first get
with an established woman.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.020
- Yeah, but I don't think women like guys

16:10.070 --> 16:11.533
that far beneath them.

16:11.583 --> 16:12.454
- And that's the paradox.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.765
You can't get established
without an established girl.

16:14.815 --> 16:15.956
But the established girl will only

16:16.006 --> 16:18.110
go out with an established guy.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.813
- So you have to trick the girl

16:20.863 --> 16:22.841
into believing you're established.

16:22.891 --> 16:23.822
- Bingo.

- Time for a little magic.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.728
- It'll never work.

18:12.772 --> 18:14.855
- What do you have there?

18:18.988 --> 18:19.821
- 1984.

18:22.415 --> 18:23.989
- Great choice.

18:24.039 --> 18:25.789
You're gonna love it.

18:27.597 --> 18:28.380
- Really?

18:28.430 --> 18:31.956
I'm actually a little bit
embarrassed to be buying it.

18:32.006 --> 18:33.106
- Why?

18:33.156 --> 18:34.323
- Well I just feel like most people read

18:34.373 --> 18:36.041
this back in high school.

18:36.091 --> 18:37.194
They're gonna see me with
it and think I wasn't

18:37.244 --> 18:41.491
paying attention for like 10
years or something like that.

18:41.541 --> 18:43.354
- No, no, no, no they won't.

18:43.404 --> 18:44.707
Actually, you know, to be honest,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.057
I think they'll respect you for brushing

18:46.107 --> 18:47.561
up on your classics.

18:47.611 --> 18:50.253
It's a real sign of self-confidence.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.179
- Really?

18:51.229 --> 18:53.120
- Well, I mean I can't speak for everyone,

18:53.170 --> 18:56.503
but I find it a very attractive quality.

18:58.061 --> 18:59.594
- Do you actually feel that way?

18:59.644 --> 19:00.477
- Sure.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.459
- Wow.

19:04.739 --> 19:07.236
I feel kind of relieved.

19:07.286 --> 19:11.476
I don't know why, but
that means a lot to me.

19:11.526 --> 19:14.938
- Well I've never seen you in here before.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.939
My name's John.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.043
- Just moved from BC, Vanessa.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.005
- Nice to meet you.

19:22.055 --> 19:25.055
Maybe you'd like to go out Saturday.

19:29.021 --> 19:30.043
- Sure.

19:30.093 --> 19:32.284
- I'm so sorry, I know
that was very abrupt.

19:32.334 --> 19:35.711
I just, well, I felt like I had to ask.

19:35.761 --> 19:37.425
- It's okay.

19:37.475 --> 19:38.922
Here.

19:38.972 --> 19:41.243
Just put your number in my phone.

19:41.293 --> 19:42.126
- Great.

19:43.083 --> 19:43.916
- Yeah.

19:46.405 --> 19:50.148
- Well listen, well I'm really
looking forward to Saturday.

19:50.198 --> 19:51.746
Nice to meet you Vanessa.

19:51.796 --> 19:52.629
- You too.

19:53.629 --> 19:54.879
- Enjoy Orwell.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.489
That was not supposed to happen was it?

19:59.539 --> 20:00.322
- That was a fluke.

20:00.372 --> 20:03.181
The God of Eros was asleep at the wheel.

20:03.231 --> 20:05.398
What are you gonna do now?

20:07.990 --> 20:10.907
- Not screw things up for a change.

20:17.581 --> 20:19.195
Okay.

20:19.245 --> 20:20.078
Okay yeah.

20:22.678 --> 20:25.667
Just remember, if you start
to lose control, just stop,

20:25.717 --> 20:29.221
count to three, regain your composure.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.938
You can't lose this.

20:31.836 --> 20:32.947
Let's go!

20:47.134 --> 20:50.444
- Well okay, let's just
say he's not my usual type,

20:50.494 --> 20:54.252
but I thought, what the heck you know?

20:54.302 --> 20:56.635
I might as well mix
things up for a change.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.963
I gotta go.

21:03.013 --> 21:03.930
I gotta go.

21:05.837 --> 21:07.443
- Vanessa, hi.

21:07.493 --> 21:08.326
Wow, you,

21:10.853 --> 21:12.890
you look wonderful.

21:12.940 --> 21:13.723
How are you?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.253
- I'm great.

21:15.303 --> 21:16.303
How are you?

21:18.949 --> 21:20.924
- I'm on top of the world.

21:25.426 --> 21:26.209
- Exactly.

21:26.259 --> 21:27.305
- That's pretty funny.

21:27.355 --> 21:28.938
Yeah, I don't know.

21:30.954 --> 21:31.949
Wow.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.782
So let me get this straight,

21:32.832 --> 21:35.134
you picked up everything and just moved

21:35.184 --> 21:36.590
to Toronto, just like that?

21:36.640 --> 21:37.719
- Well I didn't come here blind.

21:37.769 --> 21:39.064
I had the job offer at the bank

21:39.114 --> 21:43.336
and the terms are great, so,
I'm a senior analyst now.

21:43.386 --> 21:47.465
- Wow, and what exactly
does an analyst do?

21:47.515 --> 21:49.649
- It's really beautiful in Vancouver.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.392
But I was just getting so bored you know?

21:52.442 --> 21:53.343
There was nothing happening there

21:53.393 --> 21:55.809
so I came here for some adventure.

21:55.859 --> 21:58.833
- Well I'm sure they had
a copy of 1984 in BC.

21:58.883 --> 22:01.234
You probably didn't have to
come all this way for that.

22:01.284 --> 22:02.503
- Yeah.

22:02.553 --> 22:05.934
- But seriously, I really
admire your bravery.

22:05.984 --> 22:07.823
- Oh no, no, I'm not brave.

22:07.873 --> 22:09.909
Once I got here I realized
I don't know anyone,

22:09.959 --> 22:11.812
I don't know anything.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.509
Last thing I feel is brave.

22:13.559 --> 22:15.521
- No but that's I guess what
I'm talking about alright.

22:15.571 --> 22:17.679
Like not anybody can just jump

22:17.729 --> 22:19.979
into the unknown like that.

22:21.005 --> 22:23.838
So tell me, what did you do in BC?

22:25.502 --> 22:28.308
- Listen, you are so sweet to listen to me

22:28.358 --> 22:30.137
talk about myself for so long,

22:30.187 --> 22:32.270
but let's talk about you.

22:33.327 --> 22:34.160
- Okay.

22:35.171 --> 22:36.439
What do you wanna know?

22:36.489 --> 22:38.596
- I don't know, everything.

22:39.782 --> 22:41.283
Where do you see yourself in three years,

22:41.333 --> 22:43.257
what are your career goals, you know?

22:43.307 --> 22:44.253
- To be honest, I'm just taking it

22:44.303 --> 22:46.228
the way life throws it to me.

22:46.278 --> 22:50.747
- And how is it throwing
it to you right now?

22:50.797 --> 22:53.380
- Pretty relaxed, pretty chill.

22:54.479 --> 22:57.396
That's the way I like it now, so...

23:01.227 --> 23:02.759
- Maybe I should chill out more too.

23:02.809 --> 23:04.633
You know, my brothers
always telling me that.

23:04.683 --> 23:08.068
Nigel's like, "You just need
to be in the zone more."

23:08.118 --> 23:10.837
And if I was more zen I would probably be

23:10.887 --> 23:12.884
like less impulsive.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.788
Yeah, he's really into zen meditation.

23:14.838 --> 23:17.054
He says it's really good for his work.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.029
- And what does he do?

23:19.079 --> 23:20.705
- He's a consultant.

23:20.755 --> 23:22.893
- And what does he consult in?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.193
- Nigel is like

23:25.559 --> 23:27.948
my favorite person in the world.

23:27.998 --> 23:30.748
He's done so well for himself.

23:30.798 --> 23:32.174
He has more money rolling in than

23:32.224 --> 23:33.533
he knows what to do with.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.366
- Wow.

23:34.416 --> 23:36.221
- Yeah, he's just got that magic touch.

23:36.271 --> 23:38.670
And he's probably right, if I was more zen

23:38.720 --> 23:40.365
I'd be less impulsive.

23:40.415 --> 23:43.236
- You know, I'm not even
sure what consultant means.

23:43.286 --> 23:46.532
- To be honest, I did something
really big the other week,

23:46.582 --> 23:49.415
and god I'm kind of regretting it.

23:50.424 --> 23:52.291
- Okay, you gotta tell me.

23:52.341 --> 23:53.592
- Okay.

23:53.642 --> 23:57.150
Well, so one of my only friends in town

23:57.200 --> 23:59.345
was looking for a place same time as me.

23:59.395 --> 24:00.439
And we both went to see this place

24:00.489 --> 24:01.809
that we both really liked.

24:01.859 --> 24:04.276
And so, we went halves on it.

24:05.626 --> 24:07.293
- Big decision, wow.

24:08.986 --> 24:10.798
Lots of potential fallout.

24:10.848 --> 24:13.446
- Exactly, I'm kind of
horrified by what I did.

24:13.496 --> 24:14.760
- Yeah, but same thing happened to me

24:14.810 --> 24:15.921
a couple of years ago.

24:15.971 --> 24:16.754
- Really?

24:16.804 --> 24:18.567
- Yeah, yeah, a buddy and I rented this

24:18.617 --> 24:20.737
tiny tiny place together.

24:20.787 --> 24:23.481
We threw up a curtain, divided it.

24:23.531 --> 24:25.302
Sometimes the curtain would fall down.

24:25.352 --> 24:27.711
One night he comes home
completely unexpected

24:27.761 --> 24:30.344
and well, there I am, you know.

24:34.074 --> 24:35.286
Jerking off.

24:35.336 --> 24:36.753
- Yeah, I got it.

24:38.300 --> 24:41.290
- So, not always the
best living arrangement.

24:41.340 --> 24:42.173
Clearly.

24:43.244 --> 24:44.827
- Good point, yeah.

24:46.772 --> 24:48.890
My situations a little
bit different though.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.656
- You got one of those stand up dividers,

24:50.706 --> 24:51.746
stretches out like an accordion?

24:51.796 --> 24:55.096
You know, those are smart
'cause those stay up.

24:55.146 --> 24:59.225
- No, it's just that it's a two bedroom.

24:59.275 --> 25:01.536
When I said that we were splitting it,

25:01.586 --> 25:05.008
I meant that we bought a condo together.

25:05.058 --> 25:07.897
- Oh wow, you bought a place?

25:07.947 --> 25:09.220
- Yeah.

25:09.270 --> 25:10.176
- That's big.

25:10.226 --> 25:11.226
That's huge.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.753
Congratulations.

25:14.803 --> 25:15.974
- Thanks.

25:16.024 --> 25:19.293
We might not get the
financing so who knows.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.958
- Well I'm glad it's a two bedroom

25:21.008 --> 25:22.552
'cause I actually still have that curtain

25:22.602 --> 25:24.904
and I was wondering if it
was right to lend it to you.

25:24.954 --> 25:27.032
It still has a stain.

25:27.082 --> 25:27.865
Yeah.

25:27.915 --> 25:28.698
- I would have passed.

25:28.748 --> 25:30.656
- That's a good call.

25:44.248 --> 25:45.748
- One, two, three.

25:47.729 --> 25:49.182
- What are you doing?

25:49.232 --> 25:51.992
- Sorry, I didn't mean to talk out loud.

25:52.042 --> 25:52.875
I'm just

25:55.545 --> 25:58.712
remembering that I have to take these.

26:02.179 --> 26:03.429
My three pills.

26:05.050 --> 26:06.159
- Are you sick or?

26:06.209 --> 26:08.209
- No, no, I have cancer.

26:12.841 --> 26:13.624
- What?

26:13.674 --> 26:17.825
- No, no, these are to prevent the cancer.

26:17.875 --> 26:21.215
- There's pills to prevent cancer?

26:21.265 --> 26:23.354
- They're multivitamins.

26:23.404 --> 26:25.260
- With a prescription label on them?

26:25.310 --> 26:26.393
- Very multi.

26:31.203 --> 26:32.036
- Okay.

26:54.921 --> 26:56.617
- What's going on here?

26:56.667 --> 26:58.718
- It was just a kiss.

26:58.768 --> 27:02.864
Nothing really, I just I
thought, you know, a kiss.

27:02.914 --> 27:03.747
- Okay.

27:04.721 --> 27:05.504
- Too soon.

27:05.554 --> 27:06.810
- Yeah, you think?

27:06.860 --> 27:08.434
Do you even have the pills down yet?

27:08.484 --> 27:11.152
- At least two of them.

27:11.202 --> 27:14.118
- Okay, I think I'm gonna go.

27:14.168 --> 27:17.056
- No please, look, I can salvage this.

27:17.106 --> 27:18.523
God I'm so sorry.

27:19.546 --> 27:20.377
Things were going well.

27:20.427 --> 27:22.352
- Yeah, yeah they were.

27:22.402 --> 27:25.081
- I've had a really rough day,

27:25.131 --> 27:26.567
and I know I'm acting like a total weirdo

27:26.617 --> 27:29.284
and I do, I sincerely apologize.

27:30.339 --> 27:33.017
- Okay, it's okay, I understand.

27:33.067 --> 27:35.624
- Great, great, so let me take
you out next week some time

27:35.674 --> 27:37.401
and I can totally make it up to you.

27:37.451 --> 27:38.451
- Look John,

27:41.612 --> 27:42.930
I really like talking with you,

27:42.980 --> 27:46.647
but I don't think we
can continue with this.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.561
- There was a this?

27:50.611 --> 27:51.444
- No, no.

27:52.783 --> 27:54.746
Look, you're a really nice guy,

27:54.796 --> 27:58.065
we're in two completely
different places right now.

27:58.115 --> 27:59.058
- I don't know about that.

27:59.108 --> 28:01.186
I mean Bathurst really isn't
that far from Defferin--

28:01.236 --> 28:02.986
- In our lives, John.

28:04.764 --> 28:07.880
You know, I really like talking with you.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.418
You're a really nice guy.

28:09.468 --> 28:12.778
You were really nice to
me at the book store.

28:12.828 --> 28:15.052
Listen, if you wanna meet up as friends,

28:15.102 --> 28:16.874
totally down for hanging out again.

28:16.924 --> 28:18.203
- Okay, yeah.

28:18.253 --> 28:20.122
No, no, for sure.

28:20.172 --> 28:23.146
So yeah, I guess just call me

28:23.196 --> 28:25.946
the next time you wanna hang out.

28:28.878 --> 28:30.172
- Hey, I covered this okay.

28:30.222 --> 28:31.236
- Okay great.

28:31.286 --> 28:32.762
- You know what, let's just leave it

28:32.812 --> 28:34.346
at the botched make-out.

28:34.396 --> 28:36.571
I think you've had enough for one night.

28:36.621 --> 28:38.225
- Fair.

28:38.275 --> 28:40.025
- Bye John.

28:47.638 --> 28:48.471
- Idiot.

29:26.977 --> 29:28.144
God you idiot!

29:38.924 --> 29:40.257
One, two, three!

29:58.147 --> 29:59.273
- Hello.

29:59.323 --> 30:03.081
- Amy, Amy hey, it's John
from the other night.

30:03.131 --> 30:03.964
- Oh, hi.

30:05.173 --> 30:07.094
- Listen, I want you
to know I got your text

30:07.144 --> 30:09.954
and I completely understood.

30:10.004 --> 30:12.978
But I wanted to call
and tell you something.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.351
- What is it?

30:14.401 --> 30:15.807
- I have amazing news.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.234
I just heard back from my specialist

30:17.284 --> 30:19.951
and I don't have cancer anymore.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.211
- Wow, that is amazing news.

30:23.261 --> 30:24.044
- Isn't it?

30:24.094 --> 30:27.105
I mean I have a new lease on life.

30:27.155 --> 30:29.147
- I'm so happy for you.

30:29.197 --> 30:31.301
- So, what do ya say?

30:31.351 --> 30:32.899
- About what?

30:32.949 --> 30:34.273
- Well I mean being with me will now

30:34.323 --> 30:37.099
be a heartache free experience.

30:37.149 --> 30:39.113
So do you want to get together again soon?

30:39.163 --> 30:40.179
Maybe give it another go?

30:40.229 --> 30:42.856
I mean you and I, we had great energy

30:42.906 --> 30:45.239
if you know what I'm saying.

30:46.209 --> 30:48.848
- So you don't have any cancer at all?

30:48.898 --> 30:50.035
- Exactly.

30:50.085 --> 30:51.031
- Everything is fine?

30:51.081 --> 30:52.712
- Yeah, I have perfect health.

30:52.762 --> 30:54.250
Not a problem in the world.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.865
- Yeah, to be honest, I'm
really not that interested.

30:56.915 --> 30:58.748
You were pretty weird.

30:59.713 --> 31:00.496
- Wait, what?

31:00.546 --> 31:02.511
No, no, no, your text gave
me the impression that--

31:02.561 --> 31:04.009
- That was pity.

31:04.059 --> 31:05.703
I'm really glad you're feeling better

31:05.753 --> 31:08.170
but I'm super busy, gotta go.

31:17.891 --> 31:19.974
- Stupid freaking cancer!

31:26.541 --> 31:27.850
- Get lost asshole!

31:27.900 --> 31:31.983
- Yeah, we're
trying to make-out here!

31:36.744 --> 31:38.529
- This is my day.

31:38.579 --> 31:41.193
What do you think of this?

31:41.243 --> 31:43.837
"Calling all grade five and six girls.

31:43.887 --> 31:46.442
"Do you have what it takes
to tell it like it is?

31:46.492 --> 31:49.227
"Sign up for the public
speaking contest in the office.

31:49.277 --> 31:52.968
"Winners get certificates to Laser Quest."

31:53.018 --> 31:55.153
Girls like Laser Quest right?

31:55.203 --> 31:58.176
- I think I can confidently
say I don't know.

31:58.226 --> 32:00.191
And I don't care.

32:00.241 --> 32:02.551
- Oh man, you have no idea how stressful

32:02.601 --> 32:04.321
organizing this stuff is.

32:04.371 --> 32:05.204
- Try me.

32:06.316 --> 32:09.260
- Okay John, being on the
Parent Teacher Association

32:09.310 --> 32:11.669
not only opens you up to
all kinds of criticism,

32:11.719 --> 32:15.073
other parents and teachers,
but it also changes

32:15.123 --> 32:17.383
they way they view your child.

32:17.433 --> 32:19.343
Which creates a very difficult situation

32:19.393 --> 32:21.089
for everyone involved.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.047
- Then don't do it.

32:23.097 --> 32:25.698
Wait, why are you organizing
a public speaking contest?

32:25.748 --> 32:30.025
- Because Maria wants us to
get in on the ground floor.

32:30.075 --> 32:33.609
I don't know, she calls it
activist parenting or something.

32:33.659 --> 32:35.527
- Yeah it's creepy.

32:35.577 --> 32:37.153
Your kids in junior kindergarten

32:37.203 --> 32:40.064
and you're flouncing around
with grade five girls?

32:40.114 --> 32:40.897
- I'm not flouncing.

32:40.947 --> 32:42.457
Look, you don't have kids okay?

32:42.507 --> 32:43.297
You don't even know what it's like.

32:43.347 --> 32:45.481
- Yeah I don't even have
a girlfriend, thank you.

32:45.531 --> 32:46.840
- I'm sorry.

32:46.890 --> 32:48.042
Sorry it didn't work out with Vanessa

32:48.092 --> 32:49.472
but you know, it kinda sounds like--

32:49.522 --> 32:50.305
- Like I blew it?

32:50.355 --> 32:51.917
- Yeah, like you blew it.

32:51.967 --> 32:54.564
But it's okay, there'll be others.

32:54.614 --> 32:58.051
- Well I'm actually seeing
her again this weekend.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.059
We're gonna check out a couple of

32:59.109 --> 33:01.145
galleries on Queen West so.

33:01.195 --> 33:02.628
- So it's all back on?

33:02.678 --> 33:03.461
That's great.

33:03.511 --> 33:05.594
- Eh, it is and it isn't.

33:07.016 --> 33:08.243
- John don't speak to
me in in betweens man.

33:08.293 --> 33:10.046
Okay I'm making flyers all day alright.

33:10.096 --> 33:11.909
Just tell me like it is.

33:11.959 --> 33:13.253
- Alright look, when we parted it wasn't

33:13.303 --> 33:17.046
like she said "She screw
you jerk, get lost."

33:17.096 --> 33:20.462
It was more like, "Hey,
you're really cool,

33:20.512 --> 33:24.326
"but kinda weird, so
let's just be friends."

33:24.376 --> 33:25.796
- What, you're just gonna go out with her

33:25.846 --> 33:27.179
just as friends?

33:28.208 --> 33:29.500
- Yeah.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.408
And I don't know how I feel about it.

33:31.458 --> 33:33.495
- When girls say that, you're not supposed

33:33.545 --> 33:35.664
to actually go through with it.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.031
They still want nothing to do with you.

33:38.081 --> 33:39.840
It's just something they say because

33:39.890 --> 33:41.309
they don't have the guts to say

33:41.359 --> 33:42.959
"Screw you jerk, get lost."

33:43.009 --> 33:44.430
- Taylor, it's not my fault.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.647
She texted me.

33:46.735 --> 33:47.518
- Interesting.

33:47.568 --> 33:48.351
- Yeah.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.123
So, I'm gonna see it through.

33:51.173 --> 33:54.062
- Okay but that's energy, and time,

33:54.112 --> 33:56.078
and resources that would
be much better spent

33:56.128 --> 33:57.878
chasing another lead.

33:58.801 --> 34:03.608
Unless of course you actually
wanna be friends with her.

34:05.271 --> 34:06.901
- Of course I don't.

34:06.951 --> 34:09.040
- I mean that's total madness right?

34:09.090 --> 34:11.614
- I mean did think that
I could be her friend

34:11.664 --> 34:12.598
for a little while.

34:12.648 --> 34:14.222
Let her get to know me better

34:14.272 --> 34:16.152
and then I could give it another shot.

34:16.202 --> 34:17.469
- No you can't okay.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.330
Once you go into the friend zone

34:18.380 --> 34:19.797
you stay in the friend zone.

34:19.847 --> 34:21.283
- But I can turn it around.

34:21.333 --> 34:24.094
- There's no turning it around alright.

34:24.143 --> 34:26.491
Many have tried, everyone has failed.

34:26.541 --> 34:29.134
Any man who says differently is a liar.

34:29.184 --> 34:32.101
- Look, transitions can
happen quite seamlessly.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.532
You my friend are living proof.

34:33.581 --> 34:35.462
One minute you're building
beer bongs with sorority gals,

34:35.512 --> 34:37.310
the next, you're the PTA guy.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.266
- No, no, no, that's completely different.

34:40.317 --> 34:44.246
Alright, let me paint
you a picture here okay?

34:44.297 --> 34:47.643
When you're single, it's
all about finding the mate.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.675
Whether you're at the
bar with your buddies

34:49.725 --> 34:52.250
or playing sports, it's
still about gathering

34:52.300 --> 34:54.710
these ingredients that
make you the kind of guy

34:54.761 --> 34:57.500
who's gonna snag the perfect woman.

34:57.550 --> 34:58.409
Alright?

34:58.459 --> 35:01.054
It's primal, it's in our DNA.

35:01.104 --> 35:03.294
But then, once you have the family,

35:03.344 --> 35:05.411
the kids, and the wife, it's all about

35:05.461 --> 35:07.091
protecting the nest.

35:07.141 --> 35:09.228
Then you suddenly care about

35:09.278 --> 35:12.018
traffic calming zones, and PTA's,

35:12.068 --> 35:14.901
and making flyers for Laser Quest.

35:16.071 --> 35:17.449
- Well that's it then.

35:17.499 --> 35:19.814
Well that's it, that's
how I'll win over Vanessa.

35:19.864 --> 35:21.594
- Go to the community traffic forum?

35:21.644 --> 35:23.229
- No, no, no, listen, listen.

35:23.279 --> 35:24.563
So when young people, right,

35:24.613 --> 35:26.366
they're still in the dating realm.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.058
The friend zone switcheroo
can not be accomplished.

35:29.108 --> 35:29.891
- No.

35:29.941 --> 35:32.601
- But Vanessa and I, we're getting older.

35:32.651 --> 35:34.234
Okay times a ticking.

35:34.284 --> 35:35.681
So soon all of her dating conquests,

35:35.731 --> 35:36.827
they will all have failed.

35:36.877 --> 35:39.377
She will start to realize
that her ovaries are rotting

35:39.427 --> 35:41.994
and she will get the itch
to make the switch over.

35:42.044 --> 35:42.987
Trust me, I have seen this happen,

35:43.037 --> 35:44.611
and it happens fast.

35:44.661 --> 35:46.459
Who does she turn to?

35:46.509 --> 35:48.626
I'll tell ya, whoever's around.

35:48.676 --> 35:49.763
Me.

35:49.813 --> 35:51.874
- So now you're saying
you wanna marry this girl.

35:51.924 --> 35:55.620
- Well I'm not having
much luck dating her.

35:55.670 --> 35:57.297
- You're insane.

35:57.347 --> 35:58.180
But

35:59.419 --> 36:02.195
you may have some logic to your madness.

36:02.245 --> 36:03.078
But

36:03.940 --> 36:05.723
there are some risks involved.

36:05.773 --> 36:06.556
- Such as?

36:06.606 --> 36:09.445
- Well what if Mr. Right
comes along, then what?

36:09.495 --> 36:11.274
- No, I'll get rid of those guys.

36:11.324 --> 36:12.657
Smear campaigns.

36:13.607 --> 36:17.016
- The biggest pain to the friend zone

36:17.066 --> 36:18.899
is being the shoulder.

36:19.836 --> 36:21.074
- The shoulder?

36:21.124 --> 36:23.161
- The straight male support system.

36:23.211 --> 36:25.976
Okay, you never ever ever complain about

36:26.026 --> 36:28.261
a woman hanging out too
much with her friends

36:28.311 --> 36:29.198
or with gay dudes.

36:29.248 --> 36:31.395
Because those people allow us to escape

36:31.445 --> 36:34.694
this excruciating conversation.

36:34.744 --> 36:37.206
But the straight male support system guy,

36:37.256 --> 36:40.426
he's doomed to live that fate.

36:40.476 --> 36:42.036
- I have never played such a role.

36:42.086 --> 36:43.646
- Well I have.

36:43.696 --> 36:45.690
I mean for a little while
but I nipped it in the bud.

36:45.740 --> 36:47.189
But it's horrible, okay?

36:47.239 --> 36:49.336
They've got you on the
phone til three a.m.

36:49.386 --> 36:50.463
and they're talking about all these

36:50.513 --> 36:53.293
guys that they're dating
and how horrible they are.

36:53.343 --> 36:55.380
And she wishes she could just meet

36:55.430 --> 36:59.646
some nice, normal,
respectful guy like you.

36:59.696 --> 37:01.006
And it kills you inside.

37:01.056 --> 37:03.339
But then she drops this bomb.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.972
The sex is so good.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.372
She's gonna stay with the douche guys.

37:08.422 --> 37:09.615
- That's brutal.

37:09.665 --> 37:11.560
- It is brutal.

37:11.610 --> 37:15.159
Now, if it's on the
phone that's one thing.

37:15.209 --> 37:16.798
Because you can put the phone down

37:16.848 --> 37:18.797
and go make food or

37:18.847 --> 37:22.479
go jerk off to porn or do something else.

37:22.529 --> 37:24.362
But if it's in person,

37:26.211 --> 37:27.378
man sometimes,

37:28.333 --> 37:30.355
sometimes she puts her arm around you.

37:30.405 --> 37:31.188
- What?

37:31.238 --> 37:32.569
- Sometimes she's sitting in your lap.

37:32.619 --> 37:33.402
- No.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.265
- Sometimes she's just wearing a bra.

37:36.315 --> 37:37.098
- That's torture!

37:37.148 --> 37:37.944
- Yes, I know!

37:37.994 --> 37:40.084
Okay that's why no self-respecting man

37:40.134 --> 37:41.865
lives in the friend zone.

37:41.915 --> 37:43.754
Alright because to live in the friend zone

37:43.804 --> 37:45.637
is to live as a unich.

37:47.089 --> 37:47.872
- But the problem I have is,

37:47.922 --> 37:51.755
there is nobody else and
I want to pursue her.

37:54.554 --> 37:55.471
- I hate to

37:56.596 --> 37:59.738
support this path you're going on but

37:59.788 --> 38:01.239
if you wanna go on it,

38:01.289 --> 38:02.872
here's what you do.

38:04.985 --> 38:06.839
You find that perfect guy.

38:06.889 --> 38:09.608
Not the guy that she says that she wants.

38:09.658 --> 38:12.323
The guy that she keeps going back to okay.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.448
You find out who that guy is,

38:15.498 --> 38:17.915
and then you become that guy.

38:19.918 --> 38:22.071
- What do women want?

38:22.121 --> 38:24.038
What does Vanessa want?

38:25.753 --> 38:28.674
Are these questions even answerable?

38:28.724 --> 38:32.484
- The fact that you've asked the question

38:32.534 --> 38:34.201
is half the journey.

38:35.164 --> 38:36.747
You go forward son.

38:39.398 --> 38:41.148
It's too late for me.

39:35.082 --> 39:37.263
- Alright, great, why
don't we set up right here.

39:37.313 --> 39:38.096
- Yeah sure.

39:38.146 --> 39:41.338
- Great, thanks again
for agreeing to do this.

39:41.388 --> 39:44.221
First let me get this guy rolling.

39:45.712 --> 39:47.239
- Sure.

39:47.289 --> 39:51.022
It's kind of a strange
place to do this no?

39:51.072 --> 39:51.879
- Okay.

39:51.929 --> 39:53.724
So just like the ad said, I want to talk

39:53.774 --> 39:56.113
to you about your dating experience.

39:56.163 --> 39:57.402
Sean I mentioned that I wanted

39:57.452 --> 40:01.697
to meet a guy who did well
with young professional women.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.747
So tell me, how would you
go about meeting them?

40:07.230 --> 40:09.047
- I'll be at a bar right?

40:09.097 --> 40:11.108
And I'll be on my own just looking around

40:11.158 --> 40:13.262
and maybe there'll be a bunch of ladies,

40:13.312 --> 40:15.095
mostly keep to themselves,
but maybe there'll

40:15.145 --> 40:17.109
be one that keeps looking my way.

40:17.159 --> 40:19.592
So when her friends are in the ladies room

40:19.642 --> 40:21.432
or whatever, I'll go over and strike

40:21.482 --> 40:22.650
up a conversation.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.200
Now, I'm casual, but I'm firm.

40:26.439 --> 40:28.353
'Cause the ladies,
particularly the professionals,

40:28.403 --> 40:29.483
they like it firm.

40:29.533 --> 40:31.237
That's the key you know what I'm saying?

40:31.287 --> 40:32.441
They don't wanna be boss anymore,

40:32.491 --> 40:34.559
they wanna be bossed around.

40:34.609 --> 40:36.574
So I tell her, not so much asking,

40:36.624 --> 40:38.131
more like telling her,

40:38.181 --> 40:40.216
"Maybe you and me should meet up later."

40:40.266 --> 40:44.694
- Okay, so you think firmness
is a big part of this.

40:44.744 --> 40:46.434
- Yeah, you gotta be firm.

40:46.484 --> 40:48.336
'Cause she says yes and then we meet up

40:48.386 --> 40:49.597
at another bar right?

40:49.647 --> 40:54.310
But then a little bit
later, she's just begging.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.512
- For?

40:55.562 --> 40:56.773
- It.

40:56.823 --> 40:58.281
- Begging for it?

40:58.331 --> 40:59.831
- Oh yeah, for it.

41:01.298 --> 41:04.182
- Sean, what do you think it is about you

41:04.232 --> 41:07.128
in particular that makes her beg for it?

41:07.178 --> 41:08.011
- Well.

41:08.988 --> 41:09.821
Hey.

41:12.963 --> 41:13.796
Right?

41:14.834 --> 41:16.234
Right?

41:16.284 --> 41:17.478
- Sure, yeah.

41:17.528 --> 41:18.945
That makes sense.

41:19.807 --> 41:22.382
So Sean, do you carry yourself

41:22.432 --> 41:24.571
in any particular ways?

41:24.621 --> 41:26.048
- Well there's a lot of palookas out there

41:26.098 --> 41:29.890
and make no mistake,
Sean ain't no palooka.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.455
- No, no of course he's not.

41:31.505 --> 41:32.691
- So I don't whine.

41:32.741 --> 41:36.763
I'm not like, "Excuse me miss,
maybe if possible we could."

41:36.813 --> 41:38.369
No, no.

41:38.419 --> 41:39.676
When you're dealing with Sean he lays it

41:39.726 --> 41:40.823
on the table straight.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.203
And the ladies respond.

41:42.253 --> 41:44.129
They like the way I walk,
they like the way I talk.

41:44.179 --> 41:46.073
It's all good man.

41:46.123 --> 41:49.537
- Wow, you have covered
a lot of ground for me.

41:49.587 --> 41:53.033
And frankly, I don't know if
I have any more questions.

41:53.083 --> 41:54.534
- Well I was just getting started.

41:54.584 --> 41:56.077
- Oh, okay.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.759
Well what else did you have to say?

41:57.809 --> 41:58.759
- Don't you wanna hear all the details

41:58.809 --> 42:00.427
of what happens when I get the ladies

42:00.477 --> 42:01.529
up to my place huh?

42:01.579 --> 42:02.587
- Well I think--

42:02.637 --> 42:04.127
- Or maybe you want me to
pull it out right here.

42:04.177 --> 42:05.561
- Oh excuse me?

42:05.611 --> 42:07.359
- Do you want me to jerk off here or no?

42:07.409 --> 42:09.417
- Why the hell would you do that?

42:09.467 --> 42:12.317
- Is this some kind of joke?

42:12.367 --> 42:13.200
- Quiet!

42:14.687 --> 42:16.334
- You're the guy who puts up an ad

42:16.384 --> 42:18.569
saying that he wants a
good looking stallion

42:18.619 --> 42:19.845
for a solo video where he chats

42:19.895 --> 42:21.395
about what he does with his women.

42:21.445 --> 42:22.713
- No, no, no, no, Sean, Sean, Sean,

42:22.763 --> 42:25.761
there's clearly been some confusion here.

42:25.811 --> 42:27.150
I just wanted to meet
someone for dating advice,

42:27.200 --> 42:29.124
that is all, that is it.

42:29.174 --> 42:29.978
- So you don't want me to jerk off?

42:30.028 --> 42:31.702
- No, god please stop saying that.

42:31.752 --> 42:32.535
- Are you sure?

42:32.585 --> 42:33.368
- Yeah I'm sure.

42:33.418 --> 42:34.201
This is ridiculous.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.719
- Hey, it's what I do.

42:36.769 --> 42:38.965
Don't demean my profession.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.170
- I'm sorry.

42:40.220 --> 42:41.404
I'm very very sorry.

42:41.454 --> 42:42.695
Clearly there's been some

42:42.745 --> 42:44.662
large misunderstanding.

42:46.268 --> 42:48.518
Here, here is the 20 bucks.

42:49.604 --> 42:50.626
Thank you for coming out.

42:50.676 --> 42:51.459
- Okay well if you're paying anyway

42:51.509 --> 42:52.454
I can bring out--

42:52.504 --> 42:53.655
- We're done here, we are done.

42:53.705 --> 42:54.918
Done and done and done.

42:54.968 --> 42:55.751
Thank you.

42:55.801 --> 42:56.718
- Geez man.

42:57.752 --> 42:58.535
You know if you want some advice on

42:58.585 --> 42:59.747
how to be easy with the ladies

42:59.797 --> 43:01.531
you gotta learn to simmer down.

43:01.581 --> 43:03.154
Take it smooth.

43:03.204 --> 43:04.240
- That is a great point.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.819
And you are right, thank you.

43:05.869 --> 43:06.652
Yup.

43:06.702 --> 43:07.485
- Just saying.

43:07.535 --> 43:09.271
- Yup, thank you, thank you.

43:09.321 --> 43:10.154
Holy.

43:15.921 --> 43:18.148
The macho guys I am supposed to be like

43:18.198 --> 43:21.888
mess around on the side for 20 bucks.

43:21.938 --> 43:24.105
What the hell is going on?

43:25.274 --> 43:27.191
This project is doomed.

43:41.485 --> 43:43.827
- Okay, what have we learned so far?

43:43.877 --> 43:45.157
It's all about the confidence,

43:45.207 --> 43:47.176
and the confidence is all about the walk.

43:47.226 --> 43:48.293
- Right, got you.

43:48.343 --> 43:50.714
- Show me your walk.

43:50.764 --> 43:51.764
- Okay okay.

43:56.710 --> 43:57.921
- Not natural at all.

43:57.971 --> 44:00.471
Go back, lead with your chest.

44:01.335 --> 44:06.085
Hurry up man,.

44:07.193 --> 44:09.420
Okay no, try with your chin.

44:09.470 --> 44:10.592
With the chin yeah.

44:10.642 --> 44:11.425
- The actual chin?

44:11.475 --> 44:12.308
- Yes sir.

44:14.947 --> 44:16.566
Okay John no, no, no, no, no.

44:16.616 --> 44:17.888
Stop, stop, stop.

44:17.938 --> 44:18.975
Try with your dick.

44:19.025 --> 44:19.808
- With my what?

44:19.858 --> 44:22.105
- Your dick, lead with your groin.

44:22.155 --> 44:22.977
- This is ridiculous.

44:23.027 --> 44:24.277
- Hurry up man!

44:28.477 --> 44:29.310
- I don't.

44:32.289 --> 44:33.780
- It looks terrible man.

44:33.830 --> 44:35.636
- Look, I'm not a confident walker okay.

44:35.686 --> 44:36.723
I'm an awkward guy.

44:36.773 --> 44:38.115
We exist.

44:38.165 --> 44:41.519
- Okay, secret weapon, secret weapon.

44:41.569 --> 44:43.090
Okay, here.

44:43.140 --> 44:45.309
- No, no, no, no, no,
I don't do suits okay.

44:45.359 --> 44:46.527
I can't pull 'em off.

44:46.577 --> 44:47.672
They don't look natural on me.

44:47.722 --> 44:50.065
- John this is not a
suit, it's a sports coat.

44:50.115 --> 44:51.427
- Pretty sure they're the same thing.

44:51.477 --> 44:52.260
- I don't know the difference,

44:52.310 --> 44:53.213
but I do know that if you call it

44:53.263 --> 44:54.888
a sports coat it seems more natural

44:54.938 --> 44:56.771
to just wear it about.

44:58.309 --> 44:59.214
- Fine, I'll try it.

44:59.264 --> 45:00.316
- Thank you.

45:00.366 --> 45:01.149
- It's not gonna work.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.699
- It's gonna work.

45:09.356 --> 45:10.729
- Huh.

45:10.779 --> 45:13.134
This actually doesn't feel too bad.

45:13.184 --> 45:14.671
- It kinda molds you.

45:14.721 --> 45:15.717
- I haven't worn one of these since

45:15.767 --> 45:16.991
my grandfather's funeral.

45:17.041 --> 45:17.979
- And that's the problem man,

45:18.029 --> 45:19.561
the clothes make the man.

45:19.611 --> 45:22.372
Now, walk, with your chest.

45:22.422 --> 45:23.205
- Okay.

45:23.255 --> 45:24.038
- Let's give it another shot.

45:24.088 --> 45:25.088
- Okay okay.

45:31.095 --> 45:32.724
- There it is.

45:32.774 --> 45:34.262
- Not too shabby.

45:34.312 --> 45:35.654
- That's a walk.

45:35.704 --> 45:37.634
- I was almost strutting.

45:37.684 --> 45:40.488
- We have made a man out of you after all.

45:40.538 --> 45:42.621
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:43.967 --> 45:45.340
Hello ladies.

45:45.390 --> 45:48.081
May I interest you in a
vintage copy of Kafka.

45:48.131 --> 45:49.867
Perhaps later we can have a little

45:49.917 --> 45:52.000
metamorphosis of our own.

45:55.611 --> 45:56.880
- I think we've done it man.

45:56.930 --> 45:58.073
You can now confidently walk through

45:58.123 --> 45:59.813
the galleries of Queen
West without holding

45:59.863 --> 46:01.390
your head in shame.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.420
- My bucket list gets shorter by the day.

46:03.470 --> 46:04.337
- Come in for the real thing.

46:49.916 --> 46:52.594
- So, no condo after all huh?

46:52.644 --> 46:54.698
- No, we
couldn't get the mortgage.

46:54.748 --> 46:56.581
At least not the terms we wanted.

46:56.631 --> 46:58.626
It's for the best in the end.

46:58.676 --> 47:01.509
- Oh see, now this, this is great.

47:02.752 --> 47:05.758
- I never would of thought
you knew anything about art.

47:05.808 --> 47:06.836
- Oh I don't.

47:06.886 --> 47:08.413
But working at a book store you kinda

47:08.463 --> 47:11.128
learn tidbits about everything.

47:11.178 --> 47:12.895
- Are you gonna stay there a while?

47:12.945 --> 47:14.226
- No, it's just short term.

47:14.276 --> 47:15.059
- Oh yeah?

47:15.109 --> 47:16.040
How long have you been there?

47:16.090 --> 47:17.392
- Seven years.

47:17.442 --> 47:19.406
But I'm actually thinking
about buying the place.

47:19.456 --> 47:20.239
You know, the owner's getting old

47:20.289 --> 47:22.855
and I figured I could get a loan.

47:22.905 --> 47:25.291
- That would be cool
to own your own place.

47:25.341 --> 47:26.308
- Yeah.

47:26.358 --> 47:27.147
- But do you really think a bank

47:27.197 --> 47:29.166
would give you a loan for a book store?

47:29.216 --> 47:31.845
Isn't it a tough industry?

47:31.895 --> 47:34.312
- Yeah maybe I won't do that.

47:35.986 --> 47:38.140
- I used to work in a book
store when I was in school.

47:38.190 --> 47:39.690
I really loved it.

47:40.986 --> 47:44.240
- Yeah you should know
this wasn't my plan.

47:44.290 --> 47:46.140
- Yeah for sure.

47:46.190 --> 47:49.187
- I just don't have many
other options right now.

47:49.237 --> 47:50.405
- Sure you do.

47:50.455 --> 47:52.331
- Yeah well I've kinda used them all up.

47:52.381 --> 47:53.214
- How?

47:54.179 --> 47:55.490
- I spent a lot of years trying to

47:55.540 --> 47:57.771
make it in some stupid band.

47:57.821 --> 47:59.130
- That's awesome.

47:59.180 --> 48:00.714
- Except I can't sing.

48:00.764 --> 48:01.547
- Who cares?

48:01.597 --> 48:03.076
Only the lead singer needs to sing.

48:03.126 --> 48:05.626
- Yeah, I was the lead singer.

48:06.622 --> 48:07.405
- Oh.

48:07.455 --> 48:08.544
- Yeah.

48:08.594 --> 48:10.415
- Well, at least you tried.

48:10.465 --> 48:12.256
Can't say the same.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.818
- What are you talking about?

48:13.868 --> 48:17.112
You have your degree and
you're working in your field.

48:17.162 --> 48:18.129
That's great.

48:18.179 --> 48:20.461
- Yeah, and now I'm back at square one.

48:20.511 --> 48:21.621
- Yeah but you have a great job here.

48:21.671 --> 48:23.914
I'm sure your one in
Vancouver was pretty sweet.

48:23.964 --> 48:25.654
- Nothing worth mentioning.

48:25.704 --> 48:27.162
- Alright, well look at it this way.

48:27.212 --> 48:30.062
Okay, you're starting a new chapter,

48:30.112 --> 48:32.223
you're in a new city,

48:32.273 --> 48:34.266
you're beautiful,

48:34.316 --> 48:36.250
you're the toast of the town.

48:36.300 --> 48:37.133
- Thanks.

48:38.928 --> 48:41.399
- You don't need to be such a downer.

48:41.449 --> 48:42.907
- Look who's talking.

48:42.957 --> 48:44.751
- Hey, I have downer street cred.

48:44.801 --> 48:47.096
I have a lot of downer experience.

48:47.146 --> 48:48.396
I've earned it.

48:49.963 --> 48:52.392
- This one is really good.

48:52.442 --> 48:54.192
Totally wanna buy it.

48:58.474 --> 49:01.715
- Look, I don't wanna tiptoe around

49:01.765 --> 49:03.162
what happened the last time we hung out.

49:03.212 --> 49:04.786
I just wanna get it off my chest

49:04.836 --> 49:06.076
and I wanna say I'm really sorry for

49:06.126 --> 49:08.647
everything that happened.

49:08.697 --> 49:09.480
- It's okay.

49:09.530 --> 49:11.764
- No, no, it's really not okay.

49:11.814 --> 49:13.778
Because I have this apology conversation

49:13.828 --> 49:15.925
with people all the time.

49:15.975 --> 49:19.289
And it's becoming a pattern
and frankly, it has to stop.

49:19.339 --> 49:20.507
- Look, honestly I think it's cool

49:20.557 --> 49:23.810
that you're just willing
to hang out with me.

49:23.860 --> 49:27.873
I didn't think you'd be okay
with just being friends.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.256
- Totes magotes.

49:30.374 --> 49:31.665
- Good, 'cause I could really use

49:31.715 --> 49:34.480
a good friend right now.

49:34.530 --> 49:35.322
- Really?

49:35.372 --> 49:37.426
- Yes, I have been on a date with a

49:37.476 --> 49:38.977
different guy every single day

49:39.027 --> 49:41.241
and it's just getting too
much, you know what I mean?

49:41.291 --> 49:44.107
Like I just need a break.

49:44.157 --> 49:47.239
- Yeah, I'm actually
just coming off a break.

49:47.289 --> 49:49.078
I was hoping to jump right back on.

49:49.128 --> 49:50.239
- Yeah, I keep trying that

49:50.289 --> 49:52.848
but I just can't say no.

49:52.898 --> 49:54.299
- It's tough out there.

49:54.349 --> 49:55.359
Like a jungle.

49:55.409 --> 49:56.662
- Tell me about it.

49:56.712 --> 49:58.317
On the West Coast they come
up to you and ask you out,

49:58.367 --> 49:59.575
but here it's unrelenting.

49:59.625 --> 50:00.792
Bam, bam, bam.

50:01.990 --> 50:03.274
- Bam?

50:03.324 --> 50:06.659
- Yeah, that's another thing, the sex.

50:06.709 --> 50:09.449
- Oh wow, you're taking
a break from that too.

50:09.499 --> 50:11.974
I hear ya, I've done the same at times.

50:12.024 --> 50:13.408
Self-imposed of course.

50:13.458 --> 50:15.365
- No, not a break from that.

50:15.415 --> 50:17.093
I mean I wish, but I just keep doing it,

50:17.143 --> 50:18.338
and doing it, and doing it.

50:18.388 --> 50:22.904
Even though I tell myself
not to, it's exhausting.

50:22.954 --> 50:25.035
- Well, good news,

50:25.085 --> 50:26.980
'cause this is your night off

50:27.030 --> 50:27.863
from that.

50:29.261 --> 50:30.244
- Yeah!

50:30.294 --> 50:32.532
And isn't it fantastic?

50:32.582 --> 50:35.580
I could just take a deep
breath in and relax.

50:35.630 --> 50:36.630
No pressure.

50:37.512 --> 50:38.794
Normally at this point there would be

50:38.844 --> 50:41.044
all that tension about if
we're gonna do it later.

50:41.094 --> 50:43.524
Or at a bar it would like,
"Oh if he's paying too much

50:43.574 --> 50:45.063
"now I have to go through with it."

50:45.113 --> 50:47.887
Just like the mental
calculations that don't end.

50:47.937 --> 50:51.604
And yet for us, we both
know where we stand.

50:52.525 --> 50:53.358
- Yeah.

50:58.743 --> 51:00.943
- Isn't it awesome.

51:00.993 --> 51:04.299
- Totally liberating.

51:04.349 --> 51:06.016
- You'll survive it.

51:08.101 --> 51:09.601
- I have no doubt.

I'll bet you were the uber preppy one.

53:25.437 --> 53:26.290
- I wasn't.

53:26.340 --> 53:27.624
- No, no, even better, even better.

53:27.674 --> 53:28.552
I bet you were the girl in class

53:28.602 --> 53:30.782
that wrote in those girly
little bubble letters.

53:30.832 --> 53:32.624
- John, if you must know,

53:32.674 --> 53:34.074
I was suspended.

53:34.124 --> 53:35.570
- Ooh for what?

53:35.620 --> 53:39.134
- We smashed the principles
car windshield in grade six.

53:39.184 --> 53:40.570
- That's actually pretty badass.

53:40.620 --> 53:42.356
- Yeah exactly.

53:42.406 --> 53:43.818
What's the worst thing got up to?

53:43.868 --> 53:45.457
Forgetting to go to book club one week?

53:45.507 --> 53:46.791
- Can you just back off?

53:46.841 --> 53:48.547
Okay I was a very sensitive young man.

53:48.597 --> 53:49.979
- Awe so lame.

53:50.029 --> 53:51.779
- Vanessa.

53:53.786 --> 53:54.953
- Hey, Javier.

53:55.889 --> 53:58.578
- Hi, I'm Javier.

53:58.628 --> 53:59.411
Who are you?

53:59.461 --> 54:02.294
- Hey, I'm John, nice to meet you.

54:03.472 --> 54:04.305
- Hey.

54:09.460 --> 54:10.972
- So what's shaking?

54:11.022 --> 54:13.864
- Oh not much, we're just hanging out.

54:13.914 --> 54:15.962
I told you about my friend John right?

54:16.012 --> 54:17.227
- Oh.

54:17.277 --> 54:19.168
You're the weird guy.

54:19.218 --> 54:20.486
- I never said that.

54:20.536 --> 54:22.342
- Yeah, yeah that's me.

54:22.392 --> 54:24.733
Creepy John they call me.

54:24.783 --> 54:26.418
- Why do they call you that?

54:26.468 --> 54:28.026
- It's a joke.

54:28.076 --> 54:29.418
- I'd be pissed if my
friends called me that.

54:29.468 --> 54:32.682
- No, no, I mean it's a
joke I made right now.

54:32.732 --> 54:34.553
Besides, they wouldn't
call you creepy Javier.

54:34.603 --> 54:37.353
They'd probably call you like hazy Javier.

54:37.403 --> 54:38.756
- Are you making fun of my lazy eye?

54:38.806 --> 54:39.871
- What, no, god no.

54:39.921 --> 54:42.426
No your eyes look perfect.

54:42.476 --> 54:43.501
- Yeah, that's right.

54:43.551 --> 54:46.791
- Okay, so we're just
having fun, right guys?

54:46.841 --> 54:47.851
- Speaking of.

54:47.901 --> 54:48.684
- Yeah.

54:48.734 --> 54:49.557
- I was meeting
a couple pals here.

54:49.607 --> 54:51.110
We're gonna head to the
bowling alley downtown.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.038
You wanna come?

54:52.088 --> 54:53.965
- Yeah, it sounds awesome.

54:54.015 --> 54:55.913
- You in creepy?

54:55.963 --> 54:57.231
- No, thank you.

54:57.281 --> 55:00.147
I actually have a job
interview in the morning so--

55:00.197 --> 55:00.980
- Wait what?

55:01.030 --> 55:02.494
You never mentioned that.

55:02.544 --> 55:04.234
- Yeah, yeah, it's nothing really.

55:04.284 --> 55:05.773
I mean I don't really expect
anything to come from it.

55:05.823 --> 55:07.629
I just putting out feelers.

55:07.679 --> 55:09.715
- Well good luck.

55:09.765 --> 55:10.598
- Thanks.

55:11.750 --> 55:13.077
Well yeah, I should go.

55:13.127 --> 55:14.295
I'm gonna leave this.

55:14.345 --> 55:15.412
- John you don't have to.

55:15.462 --> 55:17.195
- I insist, I wanna cover yours.

55:17.245 --> 55:19.412
Javier, great to meet you.

56:02.680 --> 56:03.513
Sorry.

56:30.590 --> 56:33.587
- So why do you wanna become an analyst?

56:33.637 --> 56:36.487
- I appreciate the question.

56:36.537 --> 56:38.780
After a lot of reflection
I believe that my future

56:38.830 --> 56:42.242
is not in the book sales industry.

56:42.292 --> 56:44.259
And the analytic skills
that I have developed

56:44.309 --> 56:48.976
over the years would allow
me to flourish as an analyst.

56:51.269 --> 56:53.063
- Okay, so what would you
say you learned the most

56:53.113 --> 56:56.863
while earning your degree
in Women's Studies?

56:58.070 --> 56:59.965
- Well I can definitely
tell you after four

57:00.015 --> 57:04.015
years of study I still
know nothing about women.

57:04.914 --> 57:07.273
- So information retention
isn't your strength?

57:07.323 --> 57:09.187
- No, no, no, no I wouldn't say that.

57:09.237 --> 57:11.840
No, I just mean that I thrive on putting

57:11.890 --> 57:14.640
myself in challenging situations.

57:16.503 --> 57:17.336
- Okay.

57:18.401 --> 57:21.251
So we're going to do
a self-evaluation now.

57:21.301 --> 57:22.844
I'll give you a series of questions

57:22.894 --> 57:25.354
and you will rate yourself
on a scale of one to 10,

57:25.404 --> 57:27.067
with one being the lowest
rating you can give yourself

57:27.117 --> 57:29.530
and 10 being the highest, okay?

57:29.580 --> 57:33.913
- So I can just give myself
whatever ranking I want?

57:36.945 --> 57:39.390
- The goal here, is provide an accurate

57:39.440 --> 57:43.390
assessment of your
skills in the workplace.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.273
- Okay.

57:45.874 --> 57:47.699
- Alright then, and how would you rank

57:47.749 --> 57:49.916
your communication skills?

57:52.985 --> 57:53.818
- Nine?

57:55.258 --> 57:56.258
- Excellent.

57:58.321 --> 58:01.196
- And how would you rank
your analytic skills?

58:01.246 --> 58:02.721
- Nine?

58:02.771 --> 58:04.113
- Your interpersonal skills?

58:04.163 --> 58:05.026
- Oh that's a 10.

58:05.076 --> 58:07.455
That is definitely a 10.

58:07.505 --> 58:10.386
- Excellent, and how about
your leadership skills?

58:10.436 --> 58:13.014
- Well, let's say eight.

58:13.064 --> 58:15.187
You know, I'm not looking to make CEO.

58:15.237 --> 58:16.070
Yet.

58:18.691 --> 58:21.523
- Okay, now I see here you ran a

58:21.573 --> 58:24.597
girls public speaking contest.

58:24.647 --> 58:25.436
Tell me about that.

58:25.486 --> 58:27.031
- Yes, yes, that is just a little

58:27.081 --> 58:29.121
pet project of mine.

58:29.171 --> 58:31.311
I just, I firmly believe that it's

58:31.361 --> 58:34.859
very important to give
back to the community.

58:34.909 --> 58:39.588
Because if girls don't have
a voice in our society,

58:39.638 --> 58:40.805
we can't grow.

58:53.382 --> 58:54.215
Sorry.

58:55.626 --> 58:56.626
- Well John,

58:58.192 --> 59:00.620
I will give your application
to our staffing consultants

59:00.670 --> 59:03.538
and if something comes
up they'll be in touch.

59:03.588 --> 59:04.371
- That's it?

59:04.421 --> 59:05.421
- That's it.

59:06.296 --> 59:07.379
- How'd I do?

59:08.244 --> 59:09.470
- I can't disclose that.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.353
- Right.

59:11.213 --> 59:14.713
- But we appreciate you coming here today.

59:16.770 --> 59:18.020
- I start next week.

59:18.070 --> 59:20.490
- What the hell is a Junior
Logistics Analyst anyway?

59:20.540 --> 59:22.850
- No clue, isn't it great?

59:22.900 --> 59:24.287
- Yeah, really great.

59:24.337 --> 59:25.578
- Oh come on.

59:25.628 --> 59:26.411
- What?

59:26.461 --> 59:27.477
You expect me to be happy about this?

59:27.527 --> 59:29.549
- Yes, I'm moving up.

59:29.599 --> 59:30.698
- You're selling out.

59:30.748 --> 59:31.942
- How?

59:31.992 --> 59:33.506
I'm just getting a permanent job.

59:33.556 --> 59:35.014
- You already have one.

59:35.064 --> 59:36.756
- I'm not going anywhere here.

59:36.806 --> 59:38.046
This isn't a career.

59:38.096 --> 59:39.770
- Because we already have careers.

59:39.820 --> 59:40.917
We're artists!

59:40.967 --> 59:43.094
This is what we do to support our careers!

59:43.144 --> 59:45.140
- We are not artists.

59:45.190 --> 59:48.702
I sang in a band once and you
draw cartoons on the side.

59:48.752 --> 59:49.954
- That's my art!

59:50.004 --> 59:51.172
That's what I'm passionate about.

59:51.222 --> 59:52.169
Don't knock that.

59:52.219 --> 59:53.503
- I know.

59:53.553 --> 59:55.290
And you should pursue your passion okay.

59:55.340 --> 59:57.460
But you're 23 years old.

59:57.510 --> 59:58.928
You might have a graphic novel coming out

59:58.978 --> 59:59.761
in a year or two.

59:59.811 --> 01:00:00.985
I won't.

01:00:01.035 --> 01:00:03.305
We're in totally different
places in our lives.

01:00:03.355 --> 01:00:04.826
- But we're buddies man.

01:00:04.876 --> 01:00:06.890
We're partners in crime,
we solve mysteries.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.357
- We help people find alphabetized books.

01:00:11.707 --> 01:00:13.990
Look, my time with Vanessa
has made me realize

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.845
I wanna know where I'll be

01:00:15.895 --> 01:00:17.836
and what I'll be doing
five years from now.

01:00:17.886 --> 01:00:18.690
- You know, I knew that harlot

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.323
would get between our bromance.

01:00:22.395 --> 01:00:24.607
- Every bromance comes to an end.

01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:27.259
- But you were my first man.

01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:30.101
- I promise you I won't be your last.

01:00:30.151 --> 01:00:33.734
Not every bro could
rock glasses like that.

01:00:37.649 --> 01:00:39.613
- Thanks brother.

01:00:39.663 --> 01:00:41.005
It's just I'm gonna miss you man.

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:43.972
- Yeah, we've had some great times.

01:00:48.158 --> 01:00:49.953
- I want you to have these.

01:00:50.003 --> 01:00:52.230
- No, I can't take them.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.270
- No really.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.215
I wanna give you my signature look.

01:00:55.265 --> 01:00:56.476
- No seriously, I can't take those.

01:00:56.526 --> 01:00:57.547
I'll look like an idiot.

01:00:57.597 --> 01:00:58.707
I mean they work for your face

01:00:58.757 --> 01:01:00.424
but eh eh, not mine.

01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:03.103
- Yeah that's true.

01:01:03.153 --> 01:01:03.986
Sorry.

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:08.710
- It's just a temp position,
a three month contract.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.972
- Well it's still something.

01:01:10.022 --> 01:01:13.164
You probably beat out a
lot of people to get it.

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:16.455
- Yeah, I guess you just
have to sell yourself.

01:01:16.505 --> 01:01:18.601
- Exactly, that's what Nigel always says.

01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:20.414
Sell, sell, sell.

01:01:20.464 --> 01:01:22.056
- I am really looking
forward to meeting him

01:01:22.106 --> 01:01:23.374
at your party tomorrow.

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:25.652
- Yeah it should be a blast.

01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:28.826
I hear he's bringing like 10 girlfriends.

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:30.551
- I thought he wasn't from here?

01:01:30.601 --> 01:01:31.608
- Oh he's not.

01:01:31.658 --> 01:01:32.886
But his popularity with the ladies

01:01:32.936 --> 01:01:35.103
stretches from sea to sea.

01:01:36.664 --> 01:01:37.497
- Huh.

01:01:38.547 --> 01:01:40.297
Will Javier be there?

01:01:44.161 --> 01:01:46.244
- I'm not sure.

01:01:47.131 --> 01:01:49.298
- So what's with you guys?

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.417
- What do you mean?

01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:56.697
- I don't know, I mean
are you like a couple?

01:01:56.747 --> 01:02:00.162
- No, I told you, I'm
not looking for anything.

01:02:00.212 --> 01:02:05.034
- I know, I know, that's
why I'm asking, obviously.

01:02:05.084 --> 01:02:07.412
- He is just someone

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.795
who I have a good time with.

01:02:11.156 --> 01:02:13.489
- Well that is, that's nice.

01:02:14.984 --> 01:02:16.651
- Yeah it is, it is.

01:02:23.253 --> 01:02:24.595
- What are you doing?

01:02:24.645 --> 01:02:28.312
- I'm just taking off
my pants, comfortable.

01:02:33.456 --> 01:02:34.289
- Mm hmm.

01:02:39.246 --> 01:02:41.616
- It's too bad though.

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:42.833
- What's that?

01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:45.127
- With Javier.

01:02:45.177 --> 01:02:46.705
I know it wouldn't go anywhere

01:02:46.755 --> 01:02:48.672
even if I wanted it to.

01:02:50.904 --> 01:02:51.737
- Why not?

01:02:53.092 --> 01:02:55.824
- Well I'm really attracted
to him physically,

01:02:55.874 --> 01:02:58.124
if you know what I mean but

01:02:59.039 --> 01:03:02.289
he's just missing all that other stuff.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:04.743
- What other stuff?

01:03:04.793 --> 01:03:08.126
- I don't know, he doesn't listen to me.

01:03:08.984 --> 01:03:11.484
Well at least not like you do.

01:03:15.685 --> 01:03:17.607
And we don't laugh.

01:03:17.657 --> 01:03:19.854
I mean we do, we do.

01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:22.202
But it's not witty.

01:03:22.252 --> 01:03:24.419
It's just like, dumb shit.

01:03:25.963 --> 01:03:29.146
- Well having fun is important.

01:03:29.196 --> 01:03:30.446
- It is, it is.

01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:33.090
And doing different things,

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.294
like Javier would never suggest that

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:38.427
we go to an art gallery like you did.

01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:42.950
What was that?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.920
- Nothing.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:47.220
- Oh, I thought I heard breaking glass.

01:04:12.189 --> 01:04:13.821
- Hi.

01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:14.948
- Hi.

01:04:14.998 --> 01:04:18.171
I'm just setting up the music.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:19.638
Are those for me?

01:04:20.715 --> 01:04:22.765
- Happy birthday.

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:23.648
- Thanks.

01:04:29.021 --> 01:04:30.688
- Where is everyone?

01:04:31.646 --> 01:04:35.598
- Oh, there's a couple
of girls in the bathroom.

01:04:35.648 --> 01:04:40.231
I don't know them, and Nigel
should be here any second.

01:04:41.073 --> 01:04:44.833
We were planning a really small gathering.

01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:46.966
- You could of fooled me.

01:04:48.935 --> 01:04:50.270
- It was the only day Nigel had to come

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.518
and see the place and he had
business here or something.

01:04:53.568 --> 01:04:54.869
- Oh.

01:04:54.919 --> 01:04:57.669
Shouldn't today be all about you?

01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:00.364
- I don't mind.

01:05:00.414 --> 01:05:03.683
It's a nice change from going to a bar.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:04.900
- Yeah.

01:05:08.416 --> 01:05:09.249
- Thanks.

01:05:15.046 --> 01:05:17.213
- Well, what do you think?

01:05:20.293 --> 01:05:21.635
Yeah you!

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:23.518
Do you think it works?

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:29.670
- I think it's perfect.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.887
Whoa, hey hey.

01:05:31.732 --> 01:05:33.382
- I thought you
were gonna put the music on?

01:05:33.432 --> 01:05:34.873
- Right.

01:05:34.923 --> 01:05:36.506
- Okay, drink time!

01:05:38.636 --> 01:05:39.469
- Woo!

01:05:46.018 --> 01:05:47.601
- You want a drink.

01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:55.754
Monday is my birthday.

01:05:58.238 --> 01:06:00.071
Tuesday is happy hour.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.360
And Wednesday is when the
monsters come to play.

01:06:12.334 --> 01:06:13.533
- Toast!

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:16.833
- Okay, for the birthday girl, Melissa.

01:06:18.031 --> 01:06:20.031
We just met, but you are

01:06:21.425 --> 01:06:24.675
the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.420
- I will drink to that.

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:29.019
- So sweet.

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.736
- I love this place!

01:06:32.967 --> 01:06:34.224
It's perfect!

01:06:34.274 --> 01:06:35.674
We can do this!

01:06:35.724 --> 01:06:36.816
It's only listed for 2.2,

01:06:36.866 --> 01:06:38.427
I can get it for two million.

01:06:38.477 --> 01:06:39.310
Gut reno!

01:06:40.868 --> 01:06:42.359
This is gonna be the most

01:06:42.409 --> 01:06:44.374
amazing nightclub ever!

01:06:44.424 --> 01:06:46.444
I will put a water slide over there.

01:06:46.494 --> 01:06:48.055
I will put mirrors on the ceiling,

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:50.174
maybe I will put some dancers in a cage.

01:06:50.224 --> 01:06:52.418
No I'll put some panthers in a cage.

01:06:52.468 --> 01:06:53.437
I can do whatever I want,

01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:54.957
I will break all the rules

01:06:55.007 --> 01:06:56.590
because I am Nigel.

01:07:00.749 --> 01:07:03.844
Fireworks for my baby sisters birthday!

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:04.727
- Hi.

01:07:06.765 --> 01:07:08.922
Thanks for organizing this.

01:07:08.972 --> 01:07:09.994
This is my friend John.

01:07:10.044 --> 01:07:11.254
- Hey, nice to meet you.

01:07:11.304 --> 01:07:13.011
- Yeah, you too.

01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:16.041
- I just dropped a giant dupe, you?

01:07:16.091 --> 01:07:19.637
- No, no, no, no, I take
all my dumps at home.

01:07:19.687 --> 01:07:23.086
- No, dude, I just smoked
a horrifically fat dupe.

01:07:23.136 --> 01:07:24.606
I'll cut you in on the next one.

01:07:24.656 --> 01:07:26.707
Let's get some real
dancing going on in here!

01:07:26.757 --> 01:07:29.007
Vanessa switch up the song.

01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:33.034
I wanna see some creativity.

01:07:37.932 --> 01:07:39.017
Yes!

01:07:39.067 --> 01:07:40.950
That is more like it!

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.559
Yeah, really feel it.

01:07:42.609 --> 01:07:44.513
Really use the space.

01:07:44.563 --> 01:07:45.646
- Yeah, sure.

Man the party never
stops with those girls.

01:11:30.479 --> 01:11:31.312
- Yeah.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.618
- What's up out here?

01:11:35.668 --> 01:11:38.751
- Awe nothing, just clearing my head.

01:11:39.685 --> 01:11:41.581
- I once went to a
silent meditation retreat

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.868
for three whole weeks,

01:11:42.918 --> 01:11:44.501
did not say a word.

01:11:46.398 --> 01:11:47.481
- Wow.

01:11:47.531 --> 01:11:50.375
- Yeah, the toilet broke after three days.

01:11:50.425 --> 01:11:54.508
Nobody could tell maintenance,
it was disgusting.

01:11:55.968 --> 01:11:57.167
You sure you're not hiding out here

01:11:57.217 --> 01:11:59.384
from something or someone?

01:12:00.813 --> 01:12:02.396
- What do you mean?

01:12:06.814 --> 01:12:10.433
- I see the way you look at my sister eh?

01:12:10.483 --> 01:12:11.431
- Trust me,

01:12:11.481 --> 01:12:13.681
we are just friends.

01:12:13.731 --> 01:12:17.889
- She told me you're her best friend here.

01:12:17.939 --> 01:12:19.259
- Really?

01:12:19.309 --> 01:12:21.976
Vanessa, she actually said that?

01:12:22.026 --> 01:12:22.859
- Yup.

01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:25.178
- Wow.

01:12:27.462 --> 01:12:30.011
- Well listen man, John.

01:12:30.061 --> 01:12:32.679
I really appreciate you
being here for Vanessa.

01:12:32.729 --> 01:12:35.547
You know, in dealing with
it's been pretty tough on her.

01:12:35.597 --> 01:12:37.883
- Dealing with what?

01:12:37.933 --> 01:12:39.383
- You don't know.

01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:40.230
- I don't know what?

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.447
- Awe Vanessa!

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:45.903
I tell her she's gotta include people

01:12:45.953 --> 01:12:46.870
and then...

01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:50.686
She just hides it.

01:12:50.736 --> 01:12:52.439
- Wait, wait, wait, she's okay right?

01:12:52.489 --> 01:12:53.489
- Yeah, now.

01:12:55.085 --> 01:12:57.240
Her firm in BC was a scam.

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.622
She was pretty much the only
one that didn't get charged.

01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:02.489
She didn't know anything about it but

01:13:02.539 --> 01:13:04.722
it's been pretty rough on her.

01:13:04.772 --> 01:13:07.689
Plus her resume's now just useless.

01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:12.521
- But she scored that sweet
gig out here didn't she?

01:13:12.571 --> 01:13:16.543
- I guess that's what
she's telling people.

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:17.593
- Oh my god.

01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:21.917
I thought she had it all together.

01:13:21.967 --> 01:13:24.550
- Oh she does, where it counts.

01:13:26.011 --> 01:13:27.261
- Unbelievable.

01:13:31.289 --> 01:13:32.072
Wow.

01:13:32.122 --> 01:13:33.205
- John, John.

01:13:35.407 --> 01:13:37.849
I'm really glad that there's

01:13:37.899 --> 01:13:40.434
someone like you for Vanessa to lean on.

01:13:40.484 --> 01:13:43.651
You know, when I'm not around anymore.

01:13:44.757 --> 01:13:46.590
- Where are you going?

01:13:48.455 --> 01:13:51.900
- I never wanted to be a consultant.

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:52.846
I said it.

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:55.193
I never wanted to be a consultant.

01:13:55.243 --> 01:13:57.571
- Okay, what did you want to be Nigel?

01:13:57.621 --> 01:13:59.368
- I wanted to be an activist.

01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:00.643
- Really?

01:14:00.693 --> 01:14:02.254
What kind of activist?

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.087
- What?

01:14:03.137 --> 01:14:05.051
I don't remember.

01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:06.140
But now here I am.

01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:09.068
Here I am making so much money.

01:14:09.118 --> 01:14:10.389
So much money.

01:14:10.439 --> 01:14:11.913
Guess how much money I make.

01:14:11.963 --> 01:14:12.746
- I really don't--

01:14:12.796 --> 01:14:13.579
- No guess.

01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:14.797
Come on just guess!

01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:15.630
Say a number!

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.870
Don't low ball.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.703
- 100,000.

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:18.815
- No, wrong!

01:14:18.865 --> 01:14:20.448
$275,000 last year.

01:14:23.603 --> 01:14:24.482
- Wow.

01:14:24.532 --> 01:14:25.365
- Wow.

01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:28.617
And you know what else?

01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:30.084
- No, no I don't.

01:14:33.233 --> 01:14:34.400
- I'm unhappy.

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:36.810
Ha!

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.110
I am deeply deeply unhappy.

01:14:41.758 --> 01:14:43.508
- Sorry to hear that.

01:14:47.195 --> 01:14:50.862
- It's okay, because
tonight the pain stops.

01:14:53.212 --> 01:14:54.875
- I don't follow ya.

01:14:54.925 --> 01:14:56.778
- Before I walked in here,

01:14:56.828 --> 01:14:59.702
downed a whole container of meds.

01:14:59.752 --> 01:15:01.387
- No, no Nigel, that's not good.

01:15:01.437 --> 01:15:02.736
- No, it is too late man!

01:15:02.786 --> 01:15:04.318
- No, no Vanessa!

01:15:05.378 --> 01:15:06.665
- Oh god, oh god, feel that.

01:15:06.715 --> 01:15:08.826
- We gotta get you to a hospital, come on.

01:15:10.848 --> 01:15:11.681
Vanessa!

01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:13.760
Oh my god.

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.601
- Why did I have all you can eat earlier?

01:15:15.651 --> 01:15:17.033
- Oh, that stinks!

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:18.033
- I think it's good.

01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:19.572
Oh no, here we go again.

01:15:20.596 --> 01:15:21.996
- Oh god.

01:15:22.046 --> 01:15:22.829
Let it out.

01:15:22.879 --> 01:15:24.111
Let it out.

01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:25.867
Somebody call 9-1-1!

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:27.069
We gotta get you going.

01:15:27.119 --> 01:15:27.952
Oh my god.

01:15:32.091 --> 01:15:33.202
Nigel, just--

01:15:33.252 --> 01:15:34.462
- No, just stay stay stay.

01:15:34.512 --> 01:15:35.970
I gotta tell you something.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:36.853
- What?

01:15:37.865 --> 01:15:39.032
- Just listen.

01:15:40.981 --> 01:15:41.901
- Don't do it.

01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:42.784
Not on me.

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:48.725
- You seize the moment.

01:16:03.891 --> 01:16:06.799
- Didn't I tell you, this
was all gonna end in tears?

01:16:06.849 --> 01:16:09.104
Didn't I say that?

01:16:09.154 --> 01:16:11.189
- What else could I have done?

01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:14.031
- You should of cut and
run from the beginning.

01:16:14.081 --> 01:16:16.187
- But I never wanted to.

01:16:16.237 --> 01:16:18.747
- What are you gonna do now?

01:16:18.797 --> 01:16:20.797
- I still don't want to.

01:16:36.713 --> 01:16:38.046
So how ya doing?

01:16:38.881 --> 01:16:42.991
- Long day at the hospital
is pretty draining.

01:16:43.041 --> 01:16:43.874
- I bet.

01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.743
Yeah.

01:16:46.793 --> 01:16:48.626
Let's come sit, relax.

01:16:50.697 --> 01:16:51.950
Coffee?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.250
- Yeah, thanks.

01:17:01.385 --> 01:17:03.291
You've had a big day too.

01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:06.118
How was your first day at the office?

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:07.436
- It was fine.

01:17:07.486 --> 01:17:09.223
I mean it's an office job.

01:17:09.273 --> 01:17:11.148
Everyone has one.

01:17:11.198 --> 01:17:12.198
- That's it?

01:17:14.941 --> 01:17:15.774
- Yeah.

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:18.255
Forget about that.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:19.977
Sit, please.

01:17:20.027 --> 01:17:20.860
Honestly.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.889
So how's Nigel?

01:17:26.015 --> 01:17:27.999
- He's gonna be okay.

01:17:28.049 --> 01:17:29.217
- Good.

01:17:29.267 --> 01:17:31.100
That's really good.

01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:33.029
- Yeah, they have him hooked up on an IV,

01:17:33.079 --> 01:17:35.381
they said his fluids
were all out of whack.

01:17:35.431 --> 01:17:38.540
He just needed time to level out.

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:40.601
- Wow, you were definitely
right about him.

01:17:40.651 --> 01:17:41.734
He is unique.

01:17:43.276 --> 01:17:46.126
That guy is the real deal.

01:17:46.176 --> 01:17:49.468
- It's not the first time
this has happened either.

01:17:49.518 --> 01:17:53.419
What can I say, I have
an interesting family.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:54.302
- I know.

01:17:57.904 --> 01:18:00.654
- Nigel told me that he told you.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.093
I feel terrible.

01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:08.066
- Why did you lie to me?

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.669
- Does it matter?

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.552
- Yes.

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.151
You were the girl who was supposed

01:18:14.201 --> 01:18:16.353
to be too good for me.

01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:18.444
The one who elevated me.

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:21.587
- I'm sorry, but that's a
lot for one person to carry.

01:18:21.637 --> 01:18:25.852
And now I find out you're just
a regular asshole like me.

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:26.869
- Did it ever occur to you John

01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:28.984
that we're all just
regular assholes like you?

01:18:29.034 --> 01:18:30.976
- No, no, no, no, no, don't say that.

01:18:31.026 --> 01:18:32.731
- Why not, it's true?

01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:35.801
- Because, if this,
what I am what I'm doing

01:18:35.851 --> 01:18:38.351
is already it, if I've arrived,

01:18:38.401 --> 01:18:40.091
I don't wanna know.

01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:42.296
- What was I supposed to do here?

01:18:42.346 --> 01:18:44.648
I needed to get away from everything.

01:18:44.698 --> 01:18:45.936
- Just tell the truth.

01:18:45.986 --> 01:18:47.359
- Yeah well you wouldn't of liked me then.

01:18:47.409 --> 01:18:48.403
- What difference does it make?

01:18:48.453 --> 01:18:49.474
You've never liked me.

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.857
- I kind of did.

01:18:53.093 --> 01:18:54.316
- Kind of?

01:18:54.366 --> 01:18:56.980
- Yeah, I kind of did.

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:59.113
And then I really didn't.

01:19:00.557 --> 01:19:02.807
And then I kinda did again.

01:19:04.082 --> 01:19:05.915
And then I really did.

01:19:07.562 --> 01:19:08.395
- Really?

01:19:10.218 --> 01:19:11.051
- Really.

01:19:12.654 --> 01:19:14.775
- More than Javier?

01:19:14.825 --> 01:19:16.328
- Javier's just someone who I--

01:19:16.378 --> 01:19:18.255
- Okay, no, that's enough, that's enough.

01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:20.472
I will take that as a yes.

01:19:24.934 --> 01:19:26.101
- It is a yes.

01:19:55.326 --> 01:19:56.159
- Wow.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.353
Now what?

01:20:02.534 --> 01:20:04.617
- And now I'm going away.

01:20:06.112 --> 01:20:08.369
- You're, you're what?

01:20:08.419 --> 01:20:11.926
- I gotta get out of here
for a bit, I'm gonna travel.

01:20:11.976 --> 01:20:13.315
- Where?

01:20:13.365 --> 01:20:15.909
- Nigel and I are going
to England on the weekend.

01:20:15.959 --> 01:20:17.116
He has meetings there next week

01:20:17.166 --> 01:20:18.732
and I'm just gonna hang out there

01:20:18.782 --> 01:20:20.199
and then explore.

01:20:21.702 --> 01:20:23.276
- Vanessa you're not,

01:20:23.326 --> 01:20:25.855
you're not just graduating high school.

01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:27.068
This isn't the time in your life where you

01:20:27.118 --> 01:20:29.188
go to Africa for a year to find yourself.

01:20:29.238 --> 01:20:30.021
- Maybe it is.

01:20:30.071 --> 01:20:31.193
- No.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.380
No this is the time in your life

01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:35.685
when you realize you
like me more than Javier.

01:20:35.735 --> 01:20:36.966
- Well I guess it's gonna be the time

01:20:37.016 --> 01:20:38.269
for both those things.

01:20:38.319 --> 01:20:40.369
- Yeah but that feeling

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.561
might not make it a year.

01:20:42.611 --> 01:20:44.854
- Yeah, same goes for you.

01:20:44.904 --> 01:20:48.276
- I guess I'm worried about that too.

01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:49.159
I just,

01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:53.579
god I've never been in
this situation before.

01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:55.584
- And you're doing great John.

01:20:55.634 --> 01:20:57.134
You don't need me.

01:20:58.314 --> 01:21:01.064
- Need has nothing to do with it.

01:21:03.043 --> 01:21:07.043
- Maybe I'll come back
to Toronto at some point.

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.263
And we'll keep in touch.

01:21:11.816 --> 01:21:13.750
- That's what I should of done.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.633
- What?

01:21:15.598 --> 01:21:17.128
- When you were in your underwear

01:21:17.178 --> 01:21:20.201
talking about Javier on the phone.

01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:23.418
I should of made you do it over Skype.

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:30.906
- Maybe I'll only be gone a couple months

01:21:30.956 --> 01:21:34.038
and then we'll just see where we're at.

01:21:34.088 --> 01:21:35.421
- It'll kill me.

01:21:37.246 --> 01:21:39.475
- For like a day or two.

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:40.693
And then I'll be over there

01:21:40.743 --> 01:21:41.835
and I'll be on some news site

01:21:41.885 --> 01:21:45.116
and I'll see the headline,
John Lives Again.

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.203
And they'll be reporting that you've

01:21:46.253 --> 01:21:48.157
become a new man.

01:21:48.207 --> 01:21:51.347
- Maybe because of you
that's already happened.

01:21:51.397 --> 01:21:54.314
- Yeah well look at me, I'm a mess.

01:21:55.212 --> 01:21:56.890
Unemployed girl on the run with a brother

01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.690
who gets his stomach
pumped every six months.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.493
- When I first saw you, you,

01:22:05.872 --> 01:22:09.287
you seemed like the most
put together girl ever.

01:22:09.337 --> 01:22:13.004
- Well it's a tough
act, I'll tell you that.

01:22:15.396 --> 01:22:18.259
- Well, I am gonna hold you to your

01:22:18.309 --> 01:22:20.929
promise of naked Skype sessions.

01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:22.812
- That never happened.

01:22:25.851 --> 01:22:28.914
- But you do promise to email?

01:22:28.964 --> 01:22:31.547
Grab a drink when you get back?

01:22:32.678 --> 01:22:33.511
- Promise.

01:22:35.316 --> 01:22:36.149
- Okay.

01:22:37.636 --> 01:22:39.219
- Well I should go.

01:22:41.146 --> 01:22:42.778
Thanks for the coffee but

01:22:42.828 --> 01:22:44.027
Nigel gets out in the morning

01:22:44.077 --> 01:22:46.420
and he's gonna crash at
my place for a few days

01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:48.810
so I gotta get it ready.

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:50.860
- Yeah, no no of course.

01:22:57.954 --> 01:23:00.062
Say hi to your brother for me.

01:23:00.112 --> 01:23:01.112
- Yeah okay.

01:24:02.959 --> 01:24:04.126
It's all back.
