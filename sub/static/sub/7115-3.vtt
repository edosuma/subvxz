00:38.968 --> 00:39.868
...french toast.

00:39.902 --> 00:41.069
One time when I was eating

00:41.104 --> 00:42.070
French toast at a restaurant,

00:42.105 --> 00:43.405
I started laughing,

00:43.439 --> 00:45.007
And then I started choking.

00:45.041 --> 00:45.741
So the lady who ran

00:45.775 --> 00:48.582
The restaurant made me leave.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.310
So let's hear your horn.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.510
Yeah, play that funky music,

00:54.544 --> 00:56.241
White girl.

00:56.275 --> 00:57.574
You know, I'm halalf latina.

00:57.608 --> 01:08.948
Then hit it, moochacha.

01:08.982 --> 01:11.881
I think it's broken.

01:11.916 --> 01:16.847
Here, let me fix it.

01:26.457 --> 01:35.960
It's not broken.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.200
Beck, Beck, hey, you guys!

02:48.234 --> 02:49.635
Leave him alone!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.836
Oh, get off...

02:51.870 --> 02:54.205
What are you doing?

02:54.239 --> 02:55.406
Get off of me!

02:55.440 --> 02:57.507
Who is this chick?!

02:57.542 --> 02:58.809
Relax, relax, relax.

03:00.111 --> 03:00.845
Yo, yo, come on!

03:00.879 --> 03:02.213
What are you doing?

03:02.247 --> 03:03.681
That guy was beating up Beck.

03:03.715 --> 03:06.717
Oh, you poor thing.

03:06.752 --> 03:08.386
We were practicing.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.387
This is Russ.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.890
I'm Russ.

03:11.924 --> 03:13.125
He's a professional stuntman.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.126
I invited him here

03:14.161 --> 03:14.794
To teach the class

03:14.828 --> 03:16.796
About stage fighting.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.331
And now, Tori says,

03:18.365 --> 03:20.834
"What's stage fighting?"

03:20.868 --> 03:23.336
I wasn't gonna say that.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.605
What is it?

03:24.639 --> 03:25.105
Fake fighting

03:25.140 --> 03:26.173
That looks real,

03:26.207 --> 03:28.008
Like for a play or a movie.

03:28.843 --> 03:29.342
I took a class

03:29.377 --> 03:30.911
With him last summer.

03:30.946 --> 03:31.412
Well, it looked

03:31.446 --> 03:32.813
Like he was hurting you.

03:32.847 --> 03:34.916
Why do you care?

03:34.950 --> 03:35.750
'Cause I figure, he already

03:35.784 --> 03:37.685
Suffers enough pain dating you.

03:37.719 --> 03:38.819
You wanna see pain?

03:38.854 --> 03:39.920
Hey, why don't we go

03:39.955 --> 03:44.225
Sit over there?

03:44.260 --> 03:45.493
Why does she hate me?

03:45.527 --> 03:46.361
Maybe she heard you play

03:46.395 --> 03:50.399
The french horn.

03:50.433 --> 03:51.600
Now, if I throw a punch

03:51.634 --> 03:53.836
At Cat, like this...

03:56.940 --> 03:57.573
...it's easy to see

03:57.607 --> 03:58.841
That my fist didn't connect

03:58.875 --> 04:00.042
With her face.

04:00.076 --> 04:02.477
Thank you.

04:02.512 --> 04:03.044
But if we stage it

04:03.079 --> 04:06.614
From a different angle, then...

04:06.649 --> 04:08.082
Like I showed you?

04:08.116 --> 04:09.083
Sound effect, ready?

04:09.117 --> 04:10.518
All set.

04:10.552 --> 04:11.652
To the audience or camera,

04:11.686 --> 04:13.520
It'll look like this.

04:16.591 --> 04:19.326
I'm okay, everyone.

04:23.097 --> 04:23.964
All right, I'm gonna pair

04:23.999 --> 04:25.032
You guys up,

04:25.066 --> 04:26.033
And each team will work

04:26.067 --> 04:26.934
With Russ this week

04:26.968 --> 04:28.569
To prepare a fight scene.

04:28.603 --> 04:29.971
I thought his name was Steve.

04:30.005 --> 04:33.240
He does look like a Steve.

04:33.275 --> 04:34.242
My name is Russ.

04:34.276 --> 04:37.478
Okay, and on friday,

04:37.512 --> 04:38.212
You will all perform

04:38.247 --> 04:39.414
Your fight scenes here

04:39.448 --> 04:40.982
In front of the class.

04:41.016 --> 04:43.384
Now, the pairs will be:

04:43.418 --> 04:46.787
Beck and Cat, Andre and Gwen,

04:46.821 --> 04:50.023
Darren and Jess, Tori and Jade.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.759
Tori and who?

04:56.163 --> 04:56.996
Uh, wait,

04:57.030 --> 04:57.663
I'm not comfortable

04:57.697 --> 04:58.664
With my partner.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.399
Just a sec.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.301
Hey, partner.

05:02.336 --> 05:02.836
I can't wait

05:02.870 --> 05:09.142
For our fight...scene.

05:09.176 --> 05:12.145
Gulp.

05:23.325 --> 05:26.561
Status report!

05:26.595 --> 05:29.164
Status report!

05:29.198 --> 05:29.798
Will you please read

05:29.832 --> 05:30.732
The next line?

05:30.766 --> 05:31.366
I don't wanna help

05:31.400 --> 05:32.935
You rehearse.

05:32.969 --> 05:33.836
I made you oatmeal

05:33.870 --> 05:35.004
This morning.

05:35.038 --> 05:38.907
I wanted a steak sandwich.

05:38.942 --> 05:41.176
Okay, auditioning next

05:41.211 --> 05:42.778
Are Trina Vega

05:42.812 --> 05:44.313
And robbie shapiro.

05:44.347 --> 05:45.514
Oh, no, no, no!

05:45.548 --> 05:47.649
The puppet guy?

05:47.684 --> 05:49.084
Excuse me.

05:49.118 --> 05:50.319
Could I please audition

05:50.353 --> 05:51.086
With someone else?

05:51.120 --> 05:51.486
You know,

05:51.521 --> 05:53.489
You can whisper that.

05:53.523 --> 05:54.890
It's just an audition.

05:54.924 --> 05:59.795
But...

05:59.829 --> 06:02.264
Leave the puppet.

06:02.299 --> 06:02.865
Hey, it's cool.

06:02.899 --> 06:03.499
Just set me down

06:03.533 --> 06:06.502
Next to the hot blonde.

06:12.109 --> 06:12.642
Wait up.

06:12.676 --> 06:13.542
Walk faster.

06:13.577 --> 06:20.783
I'll walk faster.

06:20.817 --> 06:21.951
All right.

06:21.985 --> 06:24.320
It's World War II, 1944.

06:24.354 --> 06:25.788
You're in a submarine,

06:25.822 --> 06:27.056
1,700 feet down

06:27.090 --> 06:28.357
In the atlantic ocean,

06:28.392 --> 06:30.192
And you're probably gonna die.

06:30.227 --> 06:32.495
Action.

06:32.529 --> 06:34.731
Oh, my God, lieutenant,

06:34.765 --> 06:36.166
Status report.

06:36.200 --> 06:36.733
We've been hit

06:36.767 --> 06:37.667
On the port side, captain,

06:37.702 --> 06:39.002
Our engines are failing.

06:39.037 --> 06:39.636
Torpedoes?

06:39.671 --> 06:40.303
None left.

06:40.338 --> 06:42.806
Oye.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.807
How deep are we?

06:43.842 --> 06:44.942
1,700 feet.

06:44.976 --> 06:45.542
We're gonna have

06:45.577 --> 06:46.510
To go deeper.

06:46.544 --> 06:47.011
But we'll,

06:47.045 --> 06:48.179
I'm-plode!

06:48.213 --> 06:48.746
Implode.

06:48.781 --> 06:51.917
But we'll implode!

06:51.951 --> 06:53.686
Listen, I'd rather die

06:53.720 --> 06:55.922
Down here than live up there,

06:55.956 --> 06:57.991
Captured by the enemy.

06:58.025 --> 06:58.524
I don't know

06:58.559 --> 07:03.495
If you are brave or insane.

07:03.529 --> 07:05.063
Hey, stop it.

07:05.098 --> 07:06.865
You're a soldier.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.034
I'm also a woman

07:09.068 --> 07:16.941
Who loves you.

07:16.976 --> 07:22.079
That was fantastic!

07:22.113 --> 07:23.746
Ah, that's not your line.

07:23.781 --> 07:25.415
It's not my line.

07:25.449 --> 07:26.683
Actually, that was great,

07:26.717 --> 07:27.550
You guys.

07:27.585 --> 07:28.384
Really?

07:28.419 --> 07:29.118
'Cause if you thought

07:29.152 --> 07:30.119
I was great with him,

07:30.153 --> 07:30.686
Just imagine me

07:30.720 --> 07:31.787
With a good actor.

07:31.821 --> 07:34.956
Huh, I'll do that.

07:34.991 --> 07:39.127
Bring in the next two.

07:39.161 --> 07:39.861
Robbie.

07:39.895 --> 07:41.496
Scene.

08:06.455 --> 08:07.422
Look at her.

08:07.457 --> 08:08.023
Who?

08:08.057 --> 08:09.324
Jade, I guarantee you

08:09.358 --> 08:09.891
She's telling Beck

08:09.926 --> 08:10.392
All about how

08:10.426 --> 08:11.126
She's gonna punch me

08:11.160 --> 08:13.295
When we do our scene.

08:13.329 --> 08:13.695
I wonder

08:13.729 --> 08:18.800
If mirrors work in outer space.

08:18.834 --> 08:19.500
I mean, what am I gonna do

08:19.535 --> 08:20.835
If she really hits me?

08:20.869 --> 08:23.137
Bleed, burst into tears.

08:23.172 --> 08:24.372
I'm serious.

08:24.406 --> 08:25.707
It's stage fighting.

08:25.741 --> 08:26.941
No one really hits anybody.

08:26.976 --> 08:28.243
Yeah, but accidents happen,

08:28.277 --> 08:28.809
And what if she makes

08:28.844 --> 08:32.280
An accident happen on purpose?

08:32.313 --> 08:32.947
You know, the word mirror

08:32.981 --> 08:34.182
Has only six letters

08:34.216 --> 08:38.385
And half of them are rs?

08:38.419 --> 08:39.054
Haven't you and Jade

08:39.087 --> 08:40.289
Been rehearsing?

08:40.323 --> 08:41.657
Yeah, yesterday, after school

08:41.691 --> 08:42.224
And this morning,

08:42.258 --> 08:43.292
During study hall.

08:43.326 --> 08:44.827
And did she hit you for real?

08:44.861 --> 08:46.295
No, 'cause she probably wants

08:46.330 --> 08:46.830
To wait and do it

08:46.864 --> 08:47.764
In front of the whole class

08:47.799 --> 08:49.399
To humiliate me.

08:49.434 --> 08:50.500
Well, if she does,

08:50.535 --> 08:51.869
She loses half a letter grade.

08:51.903 --> 08:52.503
Oh, great!

08:52.537 --> 08:53.504
So she gets an "a minus"

08:53.538 --> 08:54.304
And I get a broken eye

08:54.339 --> 08:56.074
And a black nose.

08:56.108 --> 08:56.874
I think you meant...

08:56.909 --> 08:58.943
I know what I meant.

08:58.978 --> 09:00.245
My dog has a black nose.

09:00.279 --> 09:01.045
It's so cute.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.882
It's like a baby meatball.

09:03.916 --> 09:05.650
Meatballs are brown.

09:05.684 --> 09:10.288
You're so mean to me!

09:10.323 --> 09:11.122
You want half a sandwich?

09:13.459 --> 09:14.959
Hey, baby sister.

09:15.628 --> 09:16.661
Andy.

09:16.695 --> 09:17.762
Andre.

09:17.796 --> 09:19.063
Wanna sit with us?

09:19.097 --> 09:22.500
No.

09:22.534 --> 09:24.702
What's up, a-listers?

09:24.736 --> 09:30.173
What's up?

09:30.207 --> 09:31.207
No, no, man,

09:31.241 --> 09:37.980
They're gonna take my pants!

09:38.014 --> 09:39.381
Hey, hey, Trina!

09:39.415 --> 09:40.382
Excuse me, move, please, go now.

09:44.887 --> 09:45.887
Wait, wait, wait, don't...go.

09:45.922 --> 09:49.291
I'm not with...

09:49.325 --> 09:51.193
Why are you sitting here?

09:51.227 --> 10:06.042
I don't know, just hanging.

10:06.077 --> 10:09.113
I hope that was soy milk.

10:09.147 --> 10:10.548
What's the matter with you?

10:10.582 --> 10:11.416
If I drink regular milk,

10:11.450 --> 10:12.250
Then the gas builds up

10:12.285 --> 10:13.051
And up and up, and I...

10:13.085 --> 10:14.553
Why did you kiss me?!

10:14.587 --> 10:16.054
Oh, because we

10:16.089 --> 10:17.857
Like each other.

10:17.891 --> 10:19.458
We what?

10:19.493 --> 10:20.559
The audition scene,

10:20.593 --> 10:21.927
That kiss.

10:21.961 --> 10:24.664
Robbie, I was playing a part.

10:24.698 --> 10:25.364
The script said

10:25.399 --> 10:26.165
That my character

10:26.200 --> 10:27.099
Kisses your character.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.433
So that's what happened.

10:28.468 --> 10:29.835
That's all that happened.

10:29.870 --> 10:30.436
Would you be willing

10:30.470 --> 10:32.604
To convert to judaism?

10:32.638 --> 10:34.073
Wow, you've got problems.

10:34.107 --> 10:34.973
It's not a deal breaker,

10:35.008 --> 10:36.275
But...

10:36.309 --> 10:38.243
Rex!

10:38.278 --> 10:43.248
All right, who took his pants?!

10:43.282 --> 10:44.649
I'll call you.

10:44.683 --> 10:47.318
Yes, don't.

10:57.126 --> 10:57.726
I'm not in love

10:57.760 --> 10:58.427
With your mother.

10:58.461 --> 11:00.963
Don't!

11:06.636 --> 11:07.970
And scene.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.576
Next up, we have

11:13.610 --> 11:15.356
Tori and Jade.

11:26.391 --> 11:29.026
Okay, for our scene,

11:29.060 --> 11:30.494
I'm gonna be playing an old lady

11:30.528 --> 11:31.328
Who's walking home

11:31.363 --> 11:32.663
From a bingo game.

11:32.697 --> 11:37.067
And I play a brutal mugger.

11:37.102 --> 11:39.036
Yes, a brutal mugger

11:39.070 --> 11:39.870
Who mugs me

11:39.904 --> 11:42.773
Without actually hurting me.

11:42.807 --> 11:44.908
Okay, as always, be careful,

11:44.943 --> 11:46.810
And if anything goes wrong,

11:46.845 --> 11:48.446
Just yell the safe word,

11:48.480 --> 11:53.884
Which is...butternut.

11:53.918 --> 11:59.056
Okay, guys, ready?

11:59.090 --> 12:00.891
And...

12:00.925 --> 12:01.425
Butternut.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.829
What.

12:04.863 --> 12:07.631
Tori, what's the problem?

12:07.666 --> 12:09.400
I was testing the safe word.

12:09.434 --> 12:12.303
It works.

12:12.337 --> 12:14.572
Okay, I'm ready.

12:14.606 --> 12:18.209
And...action.

12:18.243 --> 12:19.444
Oh, I certainly did

12:19.478 --> 12:21.546
Enjoy the bingo,

12:21.580 --> 12:25.884
Although I do miss bob hope.

12:25.918 --> 12:26.951
Give me your money.

12:26.985 --> 12:27.485
What?!

12:27.519 --> 12:28.453
I ain't playing?

12:28.487 --> 12:28.953
Give me your money

12:28.988 --> 12:30.755
And your watch.

12:30.789 --> 12:31.789
Oh, wouldn't you rather

12:31.823 --> 12:34.124
Have this?

12:38.128 --> 12:40.664
Butternut!

12:41.366 --> 12:42.032
She's bleeding.

12:42.066 --> 12:42.833
Cut.

12:42.867 --> 12:43.467
Let me see, let me see.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.101
Are you okay?

12:44.135 --> 12:45.569
No, Tori hit me

12:45.603 --> 12:47.036
In the face for real.

12:47.071 --> 12:48.338
No, I didn't.

12:48.372 --> 12:50.007
Tell that to my bloody eye.

12:50.608 --> 12:51.007
All right,

12:51.042 --> 12:51.742
You better sit down.

12:51.776 --> 12:52.810
Somebody grab a chair.

12:52.844 --> 12:54.211
Yeah quickly, get a chair.

12:54.245 --> 12:55.212
Beck, get a chair.

12:55.246 --> 12:56.346
Here, here, here.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.347
Yeah, there we go.

12:57.381 --> 12:58.581
Just sit down.

13:01.718 --> 13:04.853
That was a breakaway chair.

13:04.888 --> 13:07.568
Aw, butternut!

13:14.638 --> 13:15.872
It hurts?

13:20.845 --> 13:21.411
Why did you hit Jade

13:21.446 --> 13:22.646
In the face with a cane?

13:22.680 --> 13:23.480
I didn't!

13:23.514 --> 13:24.714
Okay, I believe you.

13:24.749 --> 13:26.583
Don't hit me.

13:26.618 --> 13:27.951
Will you back me up here?

13:27.985 --> 13:29.218
Okay, look, I'm sure Tori

13:29.253 --> 13:30.352
Didn't mean to whack Jade

13:30.387 --> 13:31.720
In the face with the cane.

13:31.755 --> 13:33.122
Oh, why does everyone

13:33.156 --> 13:34.656
Think I hit her?

13:34.691 --> 13:36.158
Well, we were watching

13:36.192 --> 13:37.525
You guys do a scene.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.526
You hit her across the face

13:38.560 --> 13:39.727
With your cane.

13:39.762 --> 13:40.595
She fell down.

13:40.629 --> 13:41.195
And now, her eye's

13:41.230 --> 13:42.563
All bloody.

13:42.598 --> 13:43.264
Well, that doesn't mean

13:43.298 --> 13:46.001
I hit her?

13:46.035 --> 13:50.472
I kinda think it does.

13:50.507 --> 13:51.006
Jade, you know

13:51.041 --> 13:52.007
I didn't hit you.

13:52.042 --> 13:53.542
I swung, but I missed.

13:53.577 --> 13:55.578
Look, Tori...

13:56.546 --> 13:57.613
Hey, we gotta get her

13:57.648 --> 13:58.614
To the nurse.

13:58.649 --> 14:00.149
But I didn't hit her.

14:00.184 --> 14:01.617
Can someone call my mom?

14:01.652 --> 14:02.418
I'll call your mom.

14:02.453 --> 14:03.386
She doesn't need her mom.

14:03.420 --> 14:04.620
Don't bother her mom!

14:04.654 --> 14:09.057
I gotta call her mom.

14:09.092 --> 14:10.158
And I thought we were just

14:10.193 --> 14:12.461
Starting to be friends.

14:12.495 --> 14:20.902
But I didn't...

14:20.936 --> 14:22.803
No, no,

14:22.838 --> 14:25.406
I didn't get the role.

14:25.441 --> 14:26.074
I don't know.

14:26.108 --> 14:27.042
Probably 'cause I'm too pretty

14:27.076 --> 14:29.644
To be on a submarine.

14:29.679 --> 14:30.512
Yes, I am.

14:30.546 --> 14:31.747
Shut up.

14:32.715 --> 14:37.521
One sec.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.393
Oh, my God!

14:42.427 --> 14:45.129
Do you like stuffed cabbage?

14:45.164 --> 14:46.263
My mom made this,

14:46.298 --> 14:46.931
And if you have

14:46.965 --> 14:47.731
A couple of extra forks,

14:47.766 --> 14:48.365
I thought maybe...

14:48.399 --> 14:49.667
I don't like you.

14:49.701 --> 14:50.568
Yeah, you can say that

14:50.602 --> 14:52.402
But I know how I felt.

14:52.437 --> 14:53.270
There is no way

14:53.305 --> 14:54.438
That you can kiss me like that

14:54.473 --> 14:57.441
And not feel the...

14:57.475 --> 14:58.075
So you're just gonna

14:58.109 --> 15:02.780
Close the door...and lock it.

15:02.814 --> 15:03.380
And then turn off

15:03.414 --> 15:06.149
The porch light?

15:20.832 --> 15:23.100
Oh, hey, Tori!

15:23.134 --> 15:27.136
Have a seat.

15:27.171 --> 15:28.604
You look a little worried?

15:28.638 --> 15:29.371
Yeaeah, well, it's not fun

15:29.406 --> 15:29.905
Getting called into

15:29.940 --> 15:31.607
The guidance counselor's office?

15:31.641 --> 15:32.908
You're not in trouble.

15:32.942 --> 15:34.409
I'm here to help you

15:34.443 --> 15:36.778
With your violence issues.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.379
I'm not violent.

15:38.414 --> 15:39.380
I believe you.

15:39.415 --> 15:45.387
Then why is he here?

15:45.421 --> 15:46.554
Tori, I know that Jade

15:46.589 --> 15:47.255
Probably isn't

15:47.290 --> 15:48.624
Your favorite person.

15:48.658 --> 15:49.558
So?

15:49.592 --> 15:50.626
So in life, just because

15:50.660 --> 15:52.228
We may not like someone,

15:52.262 --> 15:52.795
That doesn't mean

15:52.830 --> 15:53.496
It's okay to beat 'em

15:53.530 --> 15:54.530
With a cane.

15:56.033 --> 16:00.404
Oh, relax, Derrick.

16:00.438 --> 16:01.172
I did not hit Jade

16:01.206 --> 16:02.207
With that cane.

16:02.241 --> 16:02.941
Then how do you explain

16:02.975 --> 16:04.309
Her black eye?

16:04.343 --> 16:07.145
I don't know.

16:07.179 --> 16:10.314
I'm just getting water.

16:10.349 --> 16:11.048
Listen, you were under

16:11.083 --> 16:12.383
A lot of stress

16:12.417 --> 16:12.917
And you were worried

16:12.951 --> 16:14.118
That Jade was gonna hit you,

16:14.153 --> 16:15.119
Right?

16:15.153 --> 16:16.520
Well, yeah.

16:16.555 --> 16:18.422
So you were afraid.

16:18.457 --> 16:20.324
Your adrenaline was pumping,

16:20.359 --> 16:21.693
And maybe in the heat

16:21.727 --> 16:23.895
Of the moment,
you swung on Jade

16:23.929 --> 16:26.498
With that cane for real.

16:26.532 --> 16:27.632
Maybe...

16:27.667 --> 16:33.039
Maybe.

16:33.073 --> 16:34.241
I guess it's possible.

16:36.744 --> 16:40.814
Derrick!

16:40.849 --> 16:42.016
Now, don't you feel better

16:42.051 --> 16:43.518
Admitting that you hit Jade?

16:43.552 --> 16:44.953
If I say, yes, can I go?

16:44.987 --> 16:45.286
Sure.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.687
Okay, fine, then, yes.

16:46.722 --> 16:47.588
Wait, aren't you gonna

16:47.623 --> 16:48.189
Punish her?

16:48.924 --> 16:50.391
Don't hit him.

16:50.425 --> 16:52.226
I wasn't gonna.

16:52.260 --> 16:52.759
Can you just tell me

16:52.794 --> 16:53.860
My punishment?

16:53.895 --> 16:55.061
Two weeks of detention.

16:55.763 --> 16:56.229
And...

16:56.263 --> 16:56.796
And?

16:56.830 --> 16:57.663
On friday night,

16:57.697 --> 16:58.864
The middle school's doing a play

16:58.899 --> 17:00.232
Here in the black box theatre.

17:00.266 --> 17:00.733
It ends with a big

17:00.767 --> 17:02.067
Food fight scene.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.002
So, you have to clean

17:04.036 --> 17:05.704
The theatre after the show.

17:05.738 --> 17:06.505
You know, scrape the food

17:06.539 --> 17:07.506
Off the walls.

17:07.540 --> 17:08.073
I'd have said

17:08.107 --> 17:09.273
Three weeks detention.

17:10.742 --> 17:11.310
I'll pull it.

17:20.621 --> 17:23.424
Hey, how ya feeling?

17:23.458 --> 17:24.959
My eye hurts.

17:24.992 --> 17:27.595
Oh, yeah, which one?

17:27.628 --> 17:29.897
Cute.

17:29.931 --> 17:31.366
I want coffee.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.601
What's the magic word?

17:32.635 --> 17:36.172
Get me some coffee...

17:36.206 --> 17:37.173
Please.

17:37.207 --> 17:37.840
Actually, the magic word

17:37.874 --> 17:38.874
Was lotion.

17:38.909 --> 17:39.776
But I'll accept your "please,"

17:39.810 --> 17:42.679
'Cause you got a boo-Boo eye.

17:42.713 --> 17:43.379
Two sugars.

17:43.414 --> 17:46.182
I know what to do.

17:46.217 --> 17:47.650
Come on.

17:47.685 --> 17:48.451
Go out with me

17:48.486 --> 17:49.686
On saturday night.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.054
I've already got plans.

17:51.089 --> 17:51.888
Sunday night?

17:51.923 --> 17:52.989
You make me sick.

17:53.024 --> 17:53.623
Monday?

17:54.692 --> 17:55.959
Wednesday?

17:55.993 --> 17:58.028
Oh, she's getting up.

17:58.062 --> 18:00.196
Trina, hey, wait,

18:00.231 --> 18:02.933
Baby!

18:02.967 --> 18:03.967
What's the matter?

18:04.001 --> 18:05.402
Trina's in denial.

18:05.436 --> 18:07.604
Ah, you're still on that?

18:07.638 --> 18:08.638
Trina loves me.

18:08.672 --> 18:09.739
It was a stage kiss.

18:09.774 --> 18:11.308
She was acting.

18:11.342 --> 18:12.676
You didn't feel the kiss.

18:12.710 --> 18:13.310
A girl can't fake

18:13.344 --> 18:14.411
That kind of heat.

18:14.445 --> 18:15.779
I don't care if she tells me

18:15.813 --> 18:16.446
A thousand times

18:16.481 --> 18:22.285
That it didn't mean anything...

18:22.320 --> 18:23.520
See.

18:23.554 --> 18:24.087
I want you to meet

18:24.122 --> 18:26.890
My parents.

18:26.925 --> 18:32.530
There she is.

18:32.564 --> 18:33.731
You guys,

18:33.765 --> 18:35.599
You're so dead.

18:37.835 --> 18:39.703
Oh, my God, Jade!

18:39.737 --> 18:41.038
I'm so sorry, please don't

18:41.072 --> 18:41.939
Destroy me socially,

18:41.973 --> 18:42.840
I didn't mean to.

18:42.874 --> 18:43.908
Just forget it.

18:49.114 --> 18:49.747
Oh hey, Jade!

18:49.781 --> 18:50.914
Can't... no.

18:50.949 --> 18:51.582
Jade, wait up, wait up.

18:51.616 --> 18:53.216
Jade, what?!

18:53.251 --> 18:54.384
Oh, what's wrong

18:54.418 --> 18:55.451
With your eye?

18:55.486 --> 18:56.419
Tori hit me with a cane,

18:56.454 --> 18:58.388
Remember?

18:58.423 --> 19:00.490
Yeah, but never seen

19:00.525 --> 19:05.428
A black eye drip before.

19:05.463 --> 19:08.798
This is make-up.

19:08.832 --> 19:14.237
Tori never hit you, did she?

19:14.271 --> 19:17.707
Fake black eye, fake blood.

19:17.742 --> 19:19.809
Look, you cannot tell

19:19.844 --> 19:20.977
Anyone about this,

19:21.011 --> 19:22.512
Especially Tori.

19:22.546 --> 19:24.547
I won't.

19:24.582 --> 19:25.315
Tori!

19:25.349 --> 19:26.183
Shut up, Andre!

19:26.217 --> 19:27.584
Tori, where are you?

19:27.618 --> 19:28.752
Will you please stop?

19:28.786 --> 19:29.719
Anybody seen Tori?

19:29.754 --> 19:31.021
Nobody bother Tori.

19:31.055 --> 19:47.538
False alarm. He ate a bad taco.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.080
Is that mac 'n' cheese?

19:57.115 --> 19:59.883
Who cares!

19:59.917 --> 20:00.450
Just wanted to know

20:00.484 --> 20:16.566
If it was mac 'n' cheese.

20:17.735 --> 20:20.103
I don't get it.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.371
What?

20:21.405 --> 20:22.338
I know Andre told you

20:22.373 --> 20:24.174
That I faked everything:

20:24.208 --> 20:26.242
The blood, the black eye.

20:26.277 --> 20:28.378
What is that, mac 'n' cheese?

20:28.412 --> 20:33.416
Looks like it, right?

20:33.450 --> 20:34.684
Why are you here?

20:36.186 --> 20:38.320
Why didn't you tell on me?

20:38.354 --> 20:39.454
'Cause we both

20:39.489 --> 20:40.155
Go to school here

20:40.189 --> 20:41.023
And it's not gonna be much fun

20:41.057 --> 20:41.690
For either one of us

20:41.724 --> 20:47.295
If we're fighting all the time.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.197
So, you're just gonna let

20:49.232 --> 20:51.199
Me get away with it.

20:51.234 --> 20:52.601
You took detention

20:52.635 --> 20:53.869
And a lower grade

20:53.903 --> 20:54.703
And you're scraping

20:54.737 --> 20:56.438
Crusty pudding off the wall

20:56.472 --> 20:56.938
On a friday night,

20:56.973 --> 20:58.974
Just so I won't get in trouble?

20:59.008 --> 21:01.042
Pretty much.

21:01.077 --> 21:02.844
Well, you can't be

21:02.879 --> 21:03.478
Nice to me

21:03.513 --> 21:04.446
When I've been mean to you.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.448
That's not how it works.

21:06.482 --> 21:06.882
Well, then,

21:06.916 --> 21:08.517
Try being nice to me sometime.

21:08.551 --> 21:09.718
Maybe that will work.

21:09.752 --> 21:10.652
Now, go play.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.186
I gotta scrape this

21:11.220 --> 21:13.989
Onion dip off the wall

21:14.023 --> 21:16.638
Or onion pus...

21:46.488 --> 21:49.123
This might be more fun

21:49.157 --> 21:52.826
With some tunes.

22:08.109 --> 22:08.809
Hey, D,

22:08.843 --> 22:09.443
Come scrape with us.

22:09.477 --> 22:11.945
This is fun.

22:27.296 --> 22:28.530
Here, try it with two.

23:05.192 --> 23:07.427
Have you gone to theslap.com?

23:07.462 --> 23:09.896
T-H-E-S-L-A-P.

23:09.930 --> 23:10.864
You can find out

23:10.898 --> 23:12.867
Who's doing things!

23:12.901 --> 23:14.034
Everyone at hollywood arts

23:14.069 --> 23:15.102
Puts up there pics and videos

23:15.136 --> 23:16.036
On theslap.

23:16.070 --> 23:17.070
TheSlap...

23:17.105 --> 23:18.138
DotCom.

23:18.173 --> 23:20.507
Imagine taking a warm shower,

23:20.542 --> 23:23.547
But the water is apple juice.
