GABRIEL: Ruby?

00:35.560 --> 00:37.120
He wants to talk to you.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.320
Who, my uncle or my father?

00:42.040 --> 00:44.760
I'm just passing on the message,
OK?

00:44.800 --> 00:47.240
Thanks. Job done.
By the way, we're leaving.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.280
[Knocks again] Come on.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.240
Talk to your father.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.120
Please.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.120
Yes, he lied to you.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.160
And, yes,
of course I don't approve.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.240
But if he's prepared to explain,
then I...

01:19.280 --> 01:21.040
I think you should hear him out.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.360
[Birdsong]

01:45.000 --> 01:46.560
Thank you.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.160
Well?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.760
I knew how angry and betrayed
you must have been,

01:53.800 --> 01:56.240
how that anger must have grown
and festered.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.560
So you tricked me?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.040
I knew at least this way
we would get to meet.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.760
Please forgive me.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.120
No.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.160
You're a coward and a liar.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.200
And that's why you left
when you did.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.280
And nothing's changed, has it?

02:15.320 --> 02:17.240
- Ruby, please...
- You know what?

02:18.440 --> 02:21.080
Thank you.

02:21.120 --> 02:24.080
Thank you, because without
all this... this bullshit...

02:26.120 --> 02:28.040
..I would have always wondered:

02:29.680 --> 02:31.360
"What's he like?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.640
What kind of man is he?"

02:38.120 --> 02:40.040
Well, now I know.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.760
Now I know.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.640
Please don't ever
contact me again.

It's me.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.320
My God! Pramila!

03:54.360 --> 03:57.680
- I haven't seen you since...
- My sister let me come...

03:57.720 --> 03:59.920
- To go to see Dhadkan.
- [Both chuckle]

03:59.960 --> 04:02.160
I think I saw that film
at least six times.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.560
Whoa!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.320
- Either you got fat or...
- Hey...twins!

04:07.360 --> 04:09.000
I'm not due for three weeks

04:09.040 --> 04:11.160
but the contractions started
two hours ago.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.120
- I think they're...
- [Liquid trickles]

04:14.520 --> 04:16.399
Oh, they're definitely coming.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.440
Nurse, can you get someone
to clean this up, please?

04:19.480 --> 04:21.480
- Come with me.
- Thanks.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.520
It's great to see you.
How are you?

04:23.560 --> 04:25.480
All right, I guess.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.160
Almost eight centimetres.
Nearly there.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.960
[Sighs]
I was kind of dreading this.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.240
But right now, I just want them
out. Is that wrong?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.080
Perfectly normal.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.800
When they get like beach balls,
most women have had enough.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.360
Especially if it's your first.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.520
Especially when
there's two of them.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.600
We should really call
the father.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.240
Actually, I'd rather
you called their mother.

[Brass section playing]

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
A blessing to you, sir.
Please.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.360
No, thanks.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.560
Kindness to strangers is a part
of the celebration of Utsavam.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.880
Ah. Oh, well.
Thank you very much, love.

its own unique traditions.

If you like that kind of thing.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.880
You don't?

05:51.920 --> 05:54.760
We have a saying back in
England: "Take it or leave it."

05:54.800 --> 05:57.200
That's kind of how I feel
about Hindu festivals.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.720
I mean, why not just
cut down a bit,

05:59.760 --> 06:02.120

06:02.160 --> 06:04.560

very nice meeting you.

Wait, sir. I'll make sure you
get to the other side safely.

hold of the parents, Mari?

07:15.720 --> 07:19.160
I left a message to tell them to
come straight from the airport.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.200
I've shocked you.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.680
A little.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.240
My Aunt Sweta was unwell.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.920
Breast cancer.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.360
The chemotherapy she needed
made her infertile.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.760
All she ever wanted
was a family.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.800
So I thought I could help.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.760
I give them a child...

07:45.960 --> 07:48.480
..two children.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.680
In return, my Uncle Naveen,
he's helping me move to London

07:52.720 --> 07:54.560
and take
a Hotel Management course.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.240
It's been a dream
to own my own restaurant.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.600
That way we all get
what we want.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.040
So we better make sure
things go smoothly.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.680
Sister?

08:06.800 --> 08:09.400
Twins can be tricky. So I'd like
you to stay with her.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.640
Let me know the minute
she's fully dilated.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.120

- You can talk about old times.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.080
LYDIA: Hi, Greg.
- So, dinner.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.880
Dinner already? It's 10am.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.480
I'm considering
an enormous fish.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.520
Looks pretty good, actually.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.200
Make that very good. Just need
someone to share it with.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.640
When you put it like that,
how can I refuse?

08:36.679 --> 08:38.120
It's a date.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.559
See you later.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.360
How can one lose
an engagement ring?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.680
Dr Ram, you are an idiot!

08:52.720 --> 08:54.360
Well, at last you can admit it.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.600
- It's always the first step.
- AJ.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.640
Never sneak up on me again.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.280
One day these hands
are going to find your throat.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.280
I was in the military, remember?

09:03.320 --> 09:04.800
Anyway, you're late.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.040
Mail.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.800
She was run over by a tuk-tuk.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.840
- Dad, quick.
- I don't know her name.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.000
OK. That's everything.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.360
Keys?

09:26.120 --> 09:28.520
I'll drive. The roads require
full attention.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.120
[Truck doors slam,
engine starts]

09:49.800 --> 09:51.240
Incredible.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.880
Hit by a moving vehicle,
and no sign of injury.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.160
You are lucky, my dear.
Thank you, Nurse.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.640
I'd call that a miracle.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.560
Children bounce, divine or not.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.400
But these tuk-tuks
can be a menace.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.240
I'm not disagreeing with you,
Doctor.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.400
But, in this case,
they're not to blame.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.200
The driver didn't stand
a chance.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.960
She just stood herself
in the middle of the road.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.600
This is gonna sound daft
but it looked like something

10:16.640 --> 10:19.960
out of one of them X-Team films,
the way she raised her hand.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.480
- You mean X-Men?
- Er...yeah, right.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.480
I think she genuinely believed

10:25.520 --> 10:28.080
she could stop that tuk-tuk
with magic powers.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.080
You know,
her manner is certainly unusual.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.600
We'll X-ray her, then get
in touch with her parents.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.360
Maybe they can shed some light.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.680
- I have no parents.
- Oh.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.240
I'm sorry.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
Who is your legal guardian?

10:43.320 --> 10:46.200
- Any other family members?
- You misunderstand.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.920
I have no family because...

10:47.960 --> 10:50.080
I am the goddess Lakshmi
in human form.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.040
A goddess has no need
of parents.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.760
You're doing well.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.920
- There you go.
- Oh.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.000
Oh, this feels better.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.960
Yeah, that's good.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.200
- Do you have kids?
- No.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.160
Not yet.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.360
You always had it planned.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.400
What do they say?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.560
"Life laughs at those
that make plans"?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.640
True.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.600
I was married.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.880
We tried, but the kids
never happened.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.680
And then...

11:39.720 --> 11:42.560
Well, we agreed not to be
together any more.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.480
- I'm sorry.
- I'm lucky.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.960
I have friends, family,
a job that I love.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.480
One should be grateful
for what one has.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
Uh-oh. Here we go again.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.160
- OK.
- [Winces]

11:57.200 --> 11:59.680
- That's good. Breathe into it.
- [Moans]

12:02.920 --> 12:04.840
[Bicycle bell rings]

12:28.520 --> 12:31.480
So...what did he say?

12:32.400 --> 12:33.640
It doesn't matter.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.240
The fact that you've barely said
a word suggests it does.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.320
I really appreciate
what you're trying to do

12:41.360 --> 12:43.720
but I really just don't want
to talk about it.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.200
What the...?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.320
We're doctors.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.040
- Open tib-fib fracture.
- Oh, you think?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.600
Check his breathing.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.600
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.360
Look at this.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.400
Look at my finger.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.120
OK, his chest sounds clear.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.560
We need to get him out of here
immediately.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.600
It will take time to clear this.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.560
We have to go back
to your father's.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.480
OK. I'll get the splint.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.720
LYDIA: It won't be long now.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.560
Have you heard of oxytocin?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.920
No. Should I?

13:43.960 --> 13:46.560
They call it the love hormone.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.480
When these children are born,
your system will flood with it.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.320
It's nature's way of bonding you
with your babies.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.160
What I'm trying to say is that

13:56.200 --> 13:58.320
no matter what arrangements
have been made,

13:58.360 --> 14:01.360
there are some things that are
way beyond our control.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.800
So after they're born,

14:04.840 --> 14:07.640
it might be easier for you
if you don't hold them.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.720
I understand.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.960
Good.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.120
- Which year is this?
- 2018.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.520
And where are we?

14:19.560 --> 14:21.960
The Good Karma Hospital
in Barco.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.720
Haven't you any
trickier questions?

14:23.760 --> 14:27.120
In what year did Aston Villa
win the European Cup?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.400
1982.

It's written on your shirt.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.680
Oh.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.080
Where do you live?

14:35.120 --> 14:38.280
Vaikuntha, with my consort
Lord Vishnu.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.760
Can I go home now?
I really want to.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.240
Yes.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.200
You'll soon be home. I promise.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.120
What are you doing?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.680
This belongs to you.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.240
Yes.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.440
Use it wisely.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.080
- [Groans]
LYDIA: That's it, sweetheart.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.800
Push. Good girl!

15:11.840 --> 15:14.680
One more push. You're nearly
there. One more push.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.640
- Nearly there.
- [Baby cries]

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
Well done. Good girl.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.200
Good girl. Oh.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.760
[Baby cries]

15:27.520 --> 15:29.440
There you go.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.440
Yes.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.480
There you go, my darling.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.360
OK.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.320
One down, one to go.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.360
I managed to contact
the nearest trauma centre

15:47.400 --> 15:49.680
and they're sending
a private ambulance soon.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.520
- Good.
- Pain?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.520
Better. I gave him
another ten of mor...

15:56.160 --> 15:57.760
Hi.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.640
I heard you were back.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.840
- How is he?
- Everything's under control.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.880
An ambulance is coming for him.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.440
Good.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.120
When will we hear
about the road?

16:15.160 --> 16:18.160
Well, I've told them to let me
know as soon as it's open.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.600
Good.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.440
Will you eat something
while you wait?

16:27.800 --> 16:29.720
No, I'll stay with my patient.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.600
I understand.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.760
Dr Varma? You, perhaps?

16:36.800 --> 16:40.440
Erm...saving lives will always
make me hungry.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.040
Yes. Thank you.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.520
Come.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.480
[Baby cries]

16:49.520 --> 16:51.520
There we go. One of each.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.560
Come on, noisy one. I know.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.680
It's time to meet your brother.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.320
Shush.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.680
How are you feeling?
You all right?

17:00.720 --> 17:04.520
Like I've gone ten rounds with
a world champion heavyweight.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.119
Pram! Are you OK?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.839
Uncle Naveen.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.960
Sweta.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.800
- Thank you, Dr...
- This is Dr Fonseca.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.960
I couldn't have done this
without her.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.400
Thank you.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.440
You know what for.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.119
My pleasure.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.640
Now would you mind waiting
outside for a couple of minutes?

17:26.680 --> 17:28.680
- Sure.
- Thank you.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.480
I'll see you.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.360
See? It didn't hurt, did it?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.400
I was very gentle.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.040
Huh?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.880
My little angel.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.560
I'll get these bloods tested.
How's Pramila?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.160
I think your friend is
a very self-possessed,

17:51.200 --> 17:54.680
not to mention brave young lady.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.720
The parents are here.
We should let them in.

17:56.760 --> 18:02.000
Of course. We are almost
done here, aren't we, huh?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.480
Come on, you.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.400
Mari?

18:11.440 --> 18:14.560
It would be a mistake for us
to think this is easy for her.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.520
Yes, Dr Fonseca.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.480
- [Laughter]
- Follow me.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.840
AJ: Maybe she's an orphan?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.880
Quite possibly, yes.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.440
But she seems too educated
to be a street kid.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.120
GIRL: What shall we do?

18:46.160 --> 18:49.560
Paul. You have done everything
you possibly could.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.360
Now we'll take it from here.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.760
I'm sure the nurses will look
after her till we sort this out.

18:55.800 --> 19:00.000
No, I'll stick with her till
her folks turn up, if that's OK?

19:00.040 --> 19:03.240
Well, then, I'm sure the goddess
will enjoy your company.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.880
- Doctor?
- Yeah?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.680
Thank you.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.760
Shit.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.840
These hats are ridiculous.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.880
NAVEEN: Oh, no, they're not.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.840
Come on.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.920
- Come on.
- Thank you.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.200
I would say, "my pleasure,"
but I'd be lying.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.800
I'm never giving birth again
as long as I live!

19:51.840 --> 19:53.640
I'm just sorry we missed it.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.200
You must be exhausted.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.880
You did all the hard work.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.920
Actually, she's right, I have.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.960
[All chuckle]

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
- [Baby grizzles]
- That reminds me.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.920
Here.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.760
Amama's necklace?

20:20.800 --> 20:23.520
I saw how much you loved it
when you were staying with us.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.880
I want you to have it.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.120
But, no. I can't.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.840
What you have given us
is worth a million necklaces.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.480
LYDIA: Excuse me.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.480
Please could I have a word
with both of you in my office?

20:41.520 --> 20:43.280
Thank you.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.480
Thalassemia?

20:52.520 --> 20:55.480
I mean...
but that's treatable, right?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.840
Yes. Yes, of course.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.880
But the severity of the variant
your daughter has

21:01.920 --> 21:03.840
is likely to be life-limiting.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.320
You're saying
she's going to die?

21:12.360 --> 21:15.120
Not immediately, no.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.560
But the consequences
will be serious.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.800
There's the possibility
of delayed puberty...

21:22.960 --> 21:26.520
..bone deformities, diabetes...

21:26.560 --> 21:29.600
And the amount of regular
blood transfusions she'll need

21:29.640 --> 21:33.520
will eventually lead to iron
overload and heart failure.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.880
By what age?

21:39.920 --> 21:41.840
Perhaps we don't need
to get into that.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.200
SWETA: I want to know.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.480
We both do.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.720
Well, with the current state of
medical care here...

21:54.760 --> 21:56.400
..perhaps mid-20s.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.000
With access to chelation
therapy, maybe longer.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.240
Surely there must be
a cure out there?

22:10.280 --> 22:11.760
Maybe in the future.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.600
And the other child, our son?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.040
Is perfectly healthy,
as is often the case.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.840
I am so sorry to have to be
the one to tell you this.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.240
[Birdsong]

22:46.520 --> 22:47.960
It's funny, er...

22:48.000 --> 22:51.680
What you think is so beautiful,
I just see it as home.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.520
Well, I guess you can get used
to anything, in time.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.600
Ruby, I'm so sorry.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.120
Yeah.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.000
And for what it's worth...

23:13.240 --> 23:16.320
..I think he is too.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.560
- Did he tell you to say that?
- No.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.720
OK.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.960
You're stubborn.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
- What?
- You got that from Dad.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.440
No, I didn't.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.280
But you know what I got?

23:33.360 --> 23:35.280
Ability to roll my tongue.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.720
Ruby.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.760
Before you go.

23:44.800 --> 23:50.280
You offered to do an ultrasound
to show me my baby.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.480
Yeah.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.160
Do you have time now?

23:55.200 --> 23:56.720
Yeah.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.440
Is it your first ultrasound?

23:59.480 --> 24:01.600
Er...yeah,
I've never done it before.

We've coped before
when Sweta was sick.

The last few years
have been tough.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.560
For both of us.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.600
Can I ask, when was the last
time either of you slept?

24:36.440 --> 24:39.240
For about five minutes
on the flight.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.080
Well, why don't you go to
the hotel and see if you can...

24:42.120 --> 24:43.360
No.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.320
I want to stay with my babies.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.720
Yeah, of course. Stay with them
as long as you like.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.000
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

Yeah. Everything's fine.

Do you wanna know?

25:46.960 --> 25:48.840
I thought I wasn't allowed.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.440
I'll make an exception.

It's up to you.

It's a boy.

You know, he...
he never meant to hurt you.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.480
And you owe
our father nothing but...

..that doesn't stop you
from giving him something.

- No. Why, what's going on?

The baby boy. He's gone.
I found this in his cot.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.440
- Donation?
- No.

They've taken him.

Perhaps they lost their phone?

Nothing. I'm sorry.

Tell me, honestly.

You think I brought this
on myself?

No, of course not.

How can a woman
sell her children?

27:47.520 --> 27:51.040
It's not for me to judge you
or anyone else.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.720
Maybe.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.560

will still condemn me.

It was just too much for me.
