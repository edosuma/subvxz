00:15.133 --> 00:17.734
Today, "Sesame Street"
is all about people!

00:17.734 --> 00:19.567
Oh, like these
people right here.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.100
- Shoe #1: Left, left.
- Shoe #2: Right, right.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.333
Wait a minute.
Those are shoes, not people.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.934
Ah, but here come
some people--

00:24.934 --> 00:27.600
- Oh, no. Those are grapes.
- ( humming )

00:27.600 --> 00:29.867
Ahh. Why is it so hard
to find any people around here?

00:29.867 --> 00:31.467
- Uh, Grover.
- Hi, Chris.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.333
I mean, usually, there are lots
of people on "Sesame Street."

00:33.333 --> 00:34.934
- Grover.
- Just a minute, Alan.

00:34.934 --> 00:37.266
But I cannot seem to find any
people here today at all!

00:37.266 --> 00:39.500
Chris and Alan:
Grover! We're people.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.333
What? Ah, yes.
Found some!

Welcome to a regular

01:27.200 --> 01:28.967
Huh? What?

01:28.967 --> 01:30.133
Yip yip yip.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.400
Whoa! Ha ha!

01:33.567 --> 01:37.000
Both aliens:
Ooh. Yip yip yip yip.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Bye-bye.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.834
Do you see that?

01:40.834 --> 01:43.900
Space aliens right here
on Sesame Street!

01:43.900 --> 01:45.300
Wow!

01:45.300 --> 01:46.567
Ohh!

01:46.567 --> 01:48.500
Ohh!

01:48.500 --> 01:51.934
Hello, yip yip.
Come in, yip yip.

01:51.934 --> 01:54.133
- Can you hear me?
- Yip yip.

01:54.133 --> 01:57.133
Both:
Leader, leader.
Yip yip yip yip.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.800
Have you landed
on Earth?

01:59.800 --> 02:01.400
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.900
Ohh.
Earth, Earth.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.133
Oh, they're talking
to their leader.

02:06.133 --> 02:09.467
Have you found
any Earth people?

02:09.467 --> 02:12.200
- People.
- Um... nope, no-- ohh!

02:12.200 --> 02:14.266
Pink alien:
Ohh! People, people.

02:14.266 --> 02:16.533
People.
Yip yip.

02:16.533 --> 02:17.967
What are they doing?

02:20.834 --> 02:22.000
Greetings.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.166
Hello.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.200
Greetings.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.333
Hello.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.800
Are those people?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.300
- Ohh.
- Hmm.

02:30.533 --> 02:32.233
( clanging )

02:33.567 --> 02:35.367
No. Not people.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.233
Nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope.

02:37.233 --> 02:39.200
Ha ha ha!
Boy, they're silly!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.533
Ha ha ha!

02:40.533 --> 02:42.533
Remember, you are
on a mission to go

02:42.533 --> 02:44.467
to Sesame Street
to find out what

02:44.467 --> 02:46.233
Earth people are like.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.367
Yip yip yip yip.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.567
All:
Yip yip yip yip.

02:48.567 --> 02:49.567
Uh-huh.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.900
But this is
a secret mission.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.467
Do not let
any people see you.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.266
- Hello!
- Aliens: Ohh!

02:57.266 --> 02:59.633
No, no. An Earth person
has seen you.

02:59.633 --> 03:02.834
Return to home planet.
No, no, no, no.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.033
Wait a minute,
wait a minute. Hold on.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.467
It's okay!
Elmo's not a person.

03:06.467 --> 03:08.467
Elmo's a friendly monster.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.533
You don't have
to be afraid.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.166
Aliens: Ohh?

03:12.166 --> 03:13.967
Okay.
Let's start again.

03:13.967 --> 03:16.834
Ahem. Hello.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.200
- Hello.
- Hello.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.567
Greetings.

03:19.567 --> 03:23.567
Boy, Elmo's never
met space aliens before.

03:23.567 --> 03:28.967
Perhaps friendly monster
can help you find Earth people.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.600
- Ohh.
- Sure, yeah.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.266
Elmo can show you around

03:32.266 --> 03:34.633
and help you learn
all about people.

03:34.633 --> 03:35.867
Ha ha ha!

03:35.867 --> 03:37.166
Ohh.
Yip yip yip yip.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.667
- Yip yip yip yip.
- Yeah. Yes, yes.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.100
Thank you,
friendly monster,

03:41.100 --> 03:45.166
but do not let any people
see them, no, no, no.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.400
Oh, no problem.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.834
No one would believe
this anyway.

03:47.834 --> 03:49.467
Oh, come on, guys.
Let's go!

03:54.567 --> 03:58.166
Oh, oh, oh! See them?
Those are people.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.967
Both aliens:
Ohh!

03:59.967 --> 04:01.700
- Uh-huh.
- People.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.200
- Yeah, people.
- People, people.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.100
What are
the Earth people like?

04:06.100 --> 04:08.200
- Uh... small.
- Small.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.934
- Small, small, small.
- They're small, yeah.

04:09.934 --> 04:12.033
- People small.
- People small. Uh-huh.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.867
- Yeah, those two are small.
- Uh-huh. Good work, good work.

04:14.867 --> 04:19.834
Now we know
all Earth people are small.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.800
Wha, wha? No!
Not all people are small.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.333
Oh, oh, oh.
Look over there. Ha ha ha!

04:25.333 --> 04:26.767
- People?
- Yeah!

04:26.767 --> 04:27.967
- People?
- Yeah!

04:27.967 --> 04:29.433
- People?
- Ohh.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.934
People come in lots
of shapes and sizes.

04:31.934 --> 04:33.300
Ohh!

04:33.300 --> 04:36.066
Oh, oh. Uh-huh,
uh-huh, fascinating.

04:36.066 --> 04:39.800
They're all different,
but they're all people.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.200
Yeah, that's right.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.533
Oh, and Elmo can show you
even more people.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.934
Come on, aliens!

04:46.934 --> 04:49.333
Okay, Jesus.
Here's your lunch.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.066
- Heh heh heh.
- Thanks, Chris.

04:51.066 --> 04:52.800
Oh, you're welcome.
Heh heh.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.934
See? There's more people.

04:54.934 --> 04:57.400
Ohh.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.900
And what are
these people like?

05:00.900 --> 05:03.800
- Brown. Brown skin.
- Brown skin.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.867
Both aliens:
Yip yip yip yip yip.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.233
Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.

05:06.233 --> 05:09.600
See, Chris and Jesus
both have beautiful, brown skin.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.233
All aliens:
Ooh.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.200
Uh, Jesus,
did you hear something?

05:15.266 --> 05:16.500
Chris and Jesus:
Hmm.

05:18.066 --> 05:21.000
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Wonderful, wonderful.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.467
Now we know all Earth people
have brown skin.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.100
Oh, no,
no, no, no.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.834
Not all people.

05:29.834 --> 05:32.633
Oh. Skin comes in lots
of pretty colors.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.367
Ha ha! Oh, hey, look.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.967
Sandwiches are ready!

05:35.967 --> 05:38.633
Chris:
Oh! Just in time
for the lunch rush.

05:38.633 --> 05:40.200
- Plates.
- You see there?

05:40.200 --> 05:41.767
There's lots
of different colors.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.266
- Elmo: There's peach...
- Aliens: Peach.

05:46.266 --> 05:47.600
Elmo: And tan.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.900

05:48.900 --> 05:50.834

05:50.834 --> 05:54.200
- Elmo: And dark mocha.
- Aliens: Dark mocha?

05:54.200 --> 05:57.700
Yeah, just like you two
are blue and pink.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.767
- Ohh!
- Uh-huh.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.800
Uh, Alan,
did you hear something?

06:09.066 --> 06:10.333
Phew.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.967
- Ha!
- Elmo: Oh!

06:16.367 --> 06:19.133
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Fascinating.

06:19.133 --> 06:21.266
Earth people
come in many colors,

06:21.266 --> 06:23.934
but they are all people.

06:23.934 --> 06:25.133
Yeah!
That's right.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.533
Oh, come on.

06:26.533 --> 06:29.433
There's lots more people
to see on Sesame Street.

06:29.433 --> 06:32.800
Just don't let
any people see you.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.567
Oh, don't you worry.
We'll stay out of sight.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.066
Come on. Let's go
that way, you guys.

06:37.066 --> 06:38.567
- Come on.
- Ohh! Ooh.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.934
Hide.

06:43.934 --> 06:46.367
( inaudible )

06:48.166 --> 06:50.633
Okay. Clear.

06:50.633 --> 06:52.533
( subway train rumbling )

07:01.166 --> 07:02.667
Elmo:
Ha ha ha!

07:02.667 --> 07:05.533
Pink alien:
Ha ha ha ha!

07:05.533 --> 07:08.533
Okay. Now with
these costumes on,

07:08.533 --> 07:10.333
you don't have
to hide anymore,

07:10.333 --> 07:13.300
and we can learn
about people up close.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.667
An excellent idea,
friendly monster.

07:16.667 --> 07:17.934
Thank you.

07:17.934 --> 07:19.367
Ha ha ha!

07:19.367 --> 07:21.567
Both aliens:
Ohh! Ha ha!

07:21.567 --> 07:22.600
Yip!

07:22.600 --> 07:25.100
Both aliens:
Ha ha ha ha!

07:25.100 --> 07:27.567
- Oh-- oh!
- Oh... ( gulping )

07:27.567 --> 07:28.734
Hi there.

07:28.734 --> 07:30.367
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.300
Uh, you're not
from around here, are you?

07:34.300 --> 07:37.433
Uh, they're from
out of town.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.300
Way out of town.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.133
Yip yip yip yip yip.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.000
Okay. Well, welcome.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.100
It was nice
speaking with you.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.934
- Bye, Nina!
- Bye!

07:47.934 --> 07:49.667
D'oh!

07:49.667 --> 07:53.367
You spoke to a real
Earth person,

07:53.367 --> 07:55.900
and what did
you learn about them?

07:55.900 --> 07:57.467
- Uh, speak.
- People speak.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.667
People speak.

07:58.667 --> 07:59.900
Both aliens:
Yip yip yip yip!

07:59.900 --> 08:01.333
Speak, speak.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

08:01.333 --> 08:06.900
Now we know Earth people
all speak the same language.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.000
Uh-huh.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.233
Not all people
speak the same language.

08:10.233 --> 08:11.800
Oh. Just listen.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.500
Elmo:
Nina speaks English
and Spanish.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.633
Tírame la pelota.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.066
Tratar de agarrarla.

08:17.066 --> 08:18.500
La agarré.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.300
- Ohh!

08:37.600 --> 08:39.367
Papa, je peux jouer

08:39.367 --> 08:41.133
Oui, Mabou,

08:41.133 --> 08:42.633
Merci. Merci.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.400
See? Ha ha ha!

08:44.400 --> 08:47.033

08:50.333 --> 08:51.900
Uh, kore otoshitayo.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.333
Arigato, Maya.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.867
Oh, and some people
speak with their hands,

08:57.867 --> 08:59.834
and that's called
sign language.

08:59.834 --> 09:02.233
Oh, you want a sandwich?

09:02.233 --> 09:03.734
Sure.

09:03.734 --> 09:06.533
See? People speak lots
of different languages.

09:06.533 --> 09:09.433
- Ohh!

09:09.433 --> 09:12.300
And they are
all still people.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.600
Uh-huh.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.700
We have learned something
incredible today.

09:16.700 --> 09:21.734
There are lots
of different people on Earth.

09:21.734 --> 09:23.433
- Yip yip yip yip.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, yep.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.867
There is just
one problem.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.867
Oh.
Well, what's that?

09:27.867 --> 09:30.900
Leader:
With so many different sizes

09:30.900 --> 09:34.700
and different colors
and different languages,

09:34.700 --> 09:38.734
can people be friends?

09:38.734 --> 09:41.533
Oh, ho ho ho!
Well, of course they can.

09:41.533 --> 09:43.767

Hello, Cookie Monster

16:27.300 --> 16:29.400
Welcome to

16:29.400 --> 16:32.467

Oh, are these spiky things
pineapple plants?

16:32.467 --> 16:36.000
Yes, they are, and I can
tell you everything you need
to know about them.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.967
Pineapples are
a tropical fruit.

16:37.967 --> 16:41.200
That means they grow
in places where it's warm.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.834
Pineapples grow
on top of a plant.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.233
It has these short,
white stalks

16:45.233 --> 16:48.233
and long, spiky leaves.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.667
The workers who pick
pineapples

16:49.667 --> 16:52.400
wear thick gloves
and special glasses

16:52.400 --> 16:54.900
to keep from getting scratched
by the spiky leaves.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.200
They also have hard,
prickly skin on the outside,

16:59.200 --> 17:01.700
but inside, they are
sweet and delicious.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.834
You can eat pineapple plain

17:03.834 --> 17:07.333
or add it
to your favorite food.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.033
I hope this helps.
Good luck.

17:09.033 --> 17:11.467

Yeah. Ooh. Ahh.
Pointy, pokey, ooh!

this up before you go.

- People: Hi!
- Kid: How are you doing?

20:49.934 --> 20:51.834
Boy, Elmo loves people

20:51.834 --> 20:54.600
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.500
Hey. Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.567
Let's call her together.

21:00.567 --> 21:03.266
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:03.266 --> 21:05.633
( chime plays
"Elmo's Song" )

21:05.633 --> 21:06.934
Hiya, Elmo!

21:06.934 --> 21:08.467
What are we learning
about today?

21:08.467 --> 21:10.066
Oh, ho ho!
Hi, Smartie.

21:10.066 --> 21:13.133
Oh, Elmo wants to learn
all about people today.

21:13.133 --> 21:17.567
Oh, that's perfect because
I'm a real people person.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.266
So what do we do
to learn something new?

21:20.266 --> 21:23.233
All:
We look it up!

21:23.233 --> 21:25.500
Let's take a peek
at some of my peeps.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.000
There are lots
of different people,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.667
and they each have things
that make them special.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.033
It might be what they do

21:37.033 --> 21:38.834
or what they wear.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.767
What they eat
or the language they speak.

21:43.767 --> 21:45.667
( speaking native language )

21:45.667 --> 21:47.400
All: Ni hao!

21:47.400 --> 21:50.567
Smartie:
But even though people may be
different in lots of ways,

21:50.567 --> 21:53.667
they can be the same
in some ways, too,

21:53.667 --> 21:55.700
and anyone can be friends.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.633
Wow!
Thanks, Smartie!

21:59.633 --> 22:02.400
Call me anytime,
or as they say,

22:02.400 --> 22:05.700
have your people
call my people.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.233
Toodle-oo, Elmo!

22:07.233 --> 22:09.533
Oh, thank you, Smartie.
Bye-bye.

22:09.533 --> 22:11.066
Ha ha ha!

22:11.066 --> 22:16.033
Wow! People are different,
and they can be a lot alike.

22:16.033 --> 22:19.767
Hey!
That gives Elmo an idea.

22:19.767 --> 22:22.433
Oh, ho! Let's play
a game together.

22:22.433 --> 22:23.467
Yeah-eah-eah!

22:23.467 --> 22:24.967
Come on, come on!

22:24.967 --> 22:25.934
Ha ha ha!

22:32.700 --> 22:35.600
Elmo wonders if we can
find what's the same

22:35.600 --> 22:37.567
with these two kids.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.100
Are you ready?

22:39.100 --> 22:41.066
Let's play.

22:41.066 --> 22:42.900
How are they alike?

22:42.900 --> 22:45.567
Hmm. The hair isn't
the same.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.867
Kid:
They both have glasses!

22:47.867 --> 22:49.533
Elmo:
Hey! Yeah!

22:49.533 --> 22:50.900
She has glasses,

22:50.900 --> 22:52.767
and he has glasses, too.

22:52.767 --> 22:54.600
Kid:
Cool glasses!

22:54.600 --> 22:57.166
Elmo:
Yeah. How else
are they alike?

22:57.166 --> 23:00.300
Kid:
Hmm. It's not the clothes.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.300
But look at their shoes!

23:02.300 --> 23:05.000
They're both wearing
red high-tops.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.133
Elmo:
You're right.

23:06.133 --> 23:08.233
Their shoes are the same.

23:08.233 --> 23:10.900
Kid #2:
They like the same kind
of shoes!

23:10.900 --> 23:12.333
Elmo:
Looking good!

23:12.333 --> 23:15.467
Now can we find anything else
that they both have

23:15.467 --> 23:17.033
that's alike?

23:17.033 --> 23:18.300
Kid:
Basketballs!

23:18.300 --> 23:20.834
They both like
to play basketball!

23:20.834 --> 23:22.300
Elmo:
Oh, boy!

23:22.300 --> 23:26.367
He has a basketball,
and she has one, too.

23:26.367 --> 23:28.000
Great job, everybody!

23:28.000 --> 23:31.367
We found lots of things
that are the same.

23:31.367 --> 23:32.700
Ha ha ha!

23:32.700 --> 23:35.567
Boy, Elmo loves finding out
about people.

23:35.567 --> 23:39.333
Oh, and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:39.333 --> 23:42.266
Oh, what does Mr. Noodle
know about people?

23:42.266 --> 23:43.667

Hi, Schmoodle!

23:54.000 --> 23:55.600
Elmo:

23:55.600 --> 23:58.400
( barking )

23:58.400 --> 23:59.500
( squeaking )

23:59.500 --> 24:01.166
Kid:
That's not a person.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.233
