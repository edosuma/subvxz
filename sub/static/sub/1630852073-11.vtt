00:01.201 --> 00:02.634
<i>[Tammy] Previously
on 1000-lb Sisters...</i>

00:02.636 --> 00:04.069
You got any ice?

00:04.071 --> 00:05.304
We don't really
care for hot tea.

00:06.239 --> 00:08.173
You're so ghetto!

00:08.408 --> 00:09.274
Good God!

00:09.276 --> 00:11.110
[Amy speaking]

00:16.549 --> 00:17.549
[belches]

00:17.551 --> 00:18.884
- [Tammy] Excuse me.
- [Amy] Excuse me.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.622
There's something that me and
Michael need to tell everybody.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.657
They accepted
our offer on the house.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.525
Like, you're really
buying a house?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.428
We go sign papers
in a couple days.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.097
With you moving, what are we
gonna do with the Tammy situation?

00:32.099 --> 00:32.965
I don't know.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.199
[Chris chanting]

00:34.201 --> 00:35.968
That's the only thing left.

00:35.970 --> 00:39.671
I don't know what's gonna happen
with Tammy being out there by herself,

00:39.673 --> 00:41.073
but we're gonna have
to figure something out.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.207
- I know that.
- Yeah.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.109
[Tammy speaking]

00:44.111 --> 00:45.110
We can make some screwdrivers,

00:45.112 --> 00:46.912
margaritas,

00:46.979 --> 00:48.947
- moonshine.
- Ooh!

00:57.891 --> 00:59.024
- Cheers!
- [man] To the queen?

00:59.026 --> 01:01.126
[all] To the queen!

01:15.041 --> 01:16.208
[Brandon] Beep-beep.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.246
[Amy laughs]

01:24.050 --> 01:26.151
It's move-in day, bitches!

01:26.753 --> 01:27.619
<i>For the past two months,</i>

01:27.854 --> 01:30.089
<i>we've been remodeling our house</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:31.824
<i>so it's ready to move in.</i>

01:31.826 --> 01:34.593
I wish I had other
people here to help,

01:34.595 --> 01:38.163
but I'm just glad Misty and
Brandon were here to help me

01:38.165 --> 01:42.267
'cause I'm so overworked
and so stressed out that...

01:47.040 --> 01:50.142
[Misty] Well, what do you
want me to help you pack up?

01:50.144 --> 01:51.777
Um, you can set it in that...

01:51.779 --> 01:52.777
Move that stuff in that chair

01:52.779 --> 01:54.913
and clean out the
'frigerator if you want.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.016
Well, hopefully, we can get
the biggest part of it done today.

01:59.586 --> 02:03.222
<i>[Amy] Move-in day came
up on me so fast and</i>

02:11.598 --> 02:14.366
So, what's going on?
Why are you so upset?

02:20.373 --> 02:22.708
Yeah, but you'll be putting it
up at the new house. It's--

02:22.710 --> 02:24.877
- I know. It's just, like...
- [Misty] It's an improvement,

02:24.879 --> 02:26.345
it's not going backwards.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.411
[Amy speaking]

02:59.413 --> 03:00.846
<i>Today's my wedding!</i>

03:00.848 --> 03:02.314
Yes!

03:03.149 --> 03:04.950
- [woman 1] Come in.
- [woman 2] Come on in!

03:04.952 --> 03:05.918
[all cheering]

03:05.920 --> 03:07.319
[Amy speaking]

03:11.558 --> 03:13.125
Welcome home, baby.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.804
<i>So, it's time for a new chapter.</i>

03:25.806 --> 03:29.541
Time for a fresh start.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.211
So, have you heard anything
from Tammy next door?

03:37.083 --> 03:38.684
<i>[Misty] I think
Amy's feelings is hurt</i>

03:38.686 --> 03:40.986
that Tammy didn't
come over and at least

03:40.988 --> 03:43.288
talk to her while she was,
you know, packing,

03:43.290 --> 03:45.023
<i>but in the same token,</i>

03:45.025 --> 03:49.561
I figured Tammy would act like
that when Amy got ready to move,

03:49.563 --> 03:52.431
so it doesn't
surprise me at all.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.867
I'll take this shelf out,
but I ain't carrying that box!

03:55.869 --> 03:57.102
[Amy] That's fine.

03:58.805 --> 03:59.438
[Brandon speaking]

04:03.009 --> 04:04.142
[Brandon speaking]

04:04.177 --> 04:05.444
[Michael speaking]

04:07.080 --> 04:08.213
[both grunting]

04:10.950 --> 04:12.117
[panting]

04:15.154 --> 04:16.321
[Brandon groans]

04:18.024 --> 04:20.058
[Amy speaking]

04:38.811 --> 04:40.912
[Misty] Yeah, we'll see you
over at the new house.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.047
[Brandon] Yeah,
we'll meet you there.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.615
[Amy speaking]

04:43.617 --> 04:45.050
[Misty] Alrighty.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.786
[Amy] Hey, we're leaving
for the new place,

04:47.788 --> 04:48.887
so I'll see you later.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.888
[Tammy speaking]

04:49.890 --> 04:51.089
[bleep]

04:51.958 --> 04:53.058
[Amy speaking]

04:55.194 --> 04:56.328
[sighs]

05:29.796 --> 05:31.096
[farts]

05:32.398 --> 05:34.032
[Brandon groans] Oh, my God!

05:34.034 --> 05:34.900
[Amy laughs]

05:34.902 --> 05:36.168
<i>[Amy] You know, we were...</i>

05:36.170 --> 05:39.338
<i>Pretty much gutted
a house in two months.</i>

05:40.840 --> 05:42.040
It's been a long...

05:42.742 --> 05:44.042
process

05:44.044 --> 05:47.212
<i>and I'm physically tired.</i>

05:50.049 --> 05:51.249
[Misty] Oh, you're welcome.

05:51.818 --> 05:52.851
You got a lot done.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.686
You did a lot to the house
and it looks nice.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.088
[Amy] Yeah.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.035
The way she sees it
is she can't.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.305
It hurts her to get up and move.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.424
True, but I'm just...

06:32.426 --> 06:35.394
I'm just telling you what she's
gonna say if you say something to her.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.331
[Amy speaking]

07:04.891 --> 07:06.191
[Michael speaking]

07:06.692 --> 07:07.993
[Amanda] Okay.

07:08.461 --> 07:12.697
This and this is together.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.867
<i>[Amy] It's been a couple days since
me and Michael and Gage have moved.</i>

07:15.869 --> 07:18.270
<i>It's so quiet and peaceful here.</i>

07:18.671 --> 07:19.571
<i>It's home,</i>

07:19.573 --> 07:21.773
<i>but it's still just a big mess,</i>

07:21.775 --> 07:24.910
so Amanda come over
and we're putting stuff away,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.645
<i>we're doing laundry,</i>

07:26.647 --> 07:27.913
we're just having
a good old time,

07:27.915 --> 07:29.815
just being sisters, basically.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.050
You got all this extra
space in here.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.653
- That's gonna be your dining room, right?
<i>- [Amy] Yeah.</i>

07:34.655 --> 07:36.788
Chris just bought a new table

07:36.790 --> 07:38.723
and he's bringing us
the old table.

07:38.725 --> 07:39.991
[Amanda] Oh, okay.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.828
You all still have other furniture
and [bleep] to move or what?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.529
We're gonna get a new love seat,

07:44.597 --> 07:46.130
we need a dishwasher,

07:46.933 --> 07:49.100
- get out storage stuff-- - Girl, you got
two dishwashers in the house already!

07:49.102 --> 07:51.336
You and Michael, that's
the dishwashers right there!

07:52.071 --> 07:53.271
[laughing]

07:55.107 --> 07:56.408
[knock at door]

07:56.410 --> 07:58.109
[Amanda] Well, come on in.

07:58.778 --> 07:59.978
Well, let's get up
and go in here

07:59.980 --> 08:01.379
and look and see where
we're gonna put this table at.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.881
Yep.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.883
That table I had, it's been
in the family for a long time.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.018
Made a lot of good
meals served on it.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.855
For the first table
for your house,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.156
it'll be perfect.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.459
Our table that we have is

08:14.461 --> 08:15.894
<i>the table from our childhood,</i>

08:15.896 --> 08:20.298
<i>and now that it's time for me
to move on to something a little</i>

08:24.637 --> 08:26.838
<i>Amy needs it. She got
a big dining room.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.173
It save her
a little bit of money

08:28.175 --> 08:30.208
and it stays in the family.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.947
[Amanda chuckles]

08:35.949 --> 08:38.350
Well, we sit there
one morning for three hours,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.185
eating faster than she can cook.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.654
[Amanda] Mama J, she would
stand in there and make pancakes,

08:42.656 --> 08:46.191
and she said, "How much... How many
pancakes are these kids gonna eat?"

08:47.927 --> 08:50.161
Look at Chris doing big things!

08:52.732 --> 08:54.132
[Chris] Well, hell, no!

08:56.068 --> 08:58.136
<i>Well, you know, the truth is</i>

08:58.404 --> 09:00.005
<i>I could've got down</i>

09:00.007 --> 09:03.441
and got under the table
with me being as big as I was.

09:03.676 --> 09:04.943
The question is...

09:05.010 --> 09:08.847
Is how hard would it have been
to get my fat ass off the floor?

09:08.849 --> 09:11.249
That would've been
the rough one. [laughs]

09:11.851 --> 09:13.351
- Here you go, Amanda.
- Thank you.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.589
You know, Chris is in the...

09:17.591 --> 09:18.590
[Amy speaking]

09:18.592 --> 09:19.958
Where he...
You know, he's, what?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.327
Three months out or so from
having weight loss surgery,

09:22.329 --> 09:23.595
and, I mean, I got that.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.730
When I had the gastric bypass,
I mean, the first six months,

09:25.732 --> 09:26.598
you just [snaps fingers]
drop weight like that.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.934
- [Amy] Yeah, I dropped--
- It was easy.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.770
I mean, you did drop weight, but imagine
how much more you could have lost

09:31.772 --> 09:33.238
had you not been pregnant.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.408
Are you worried about going
to Dr. Procter's?

09:41.614 --> 09:42.847
<i>In a few days,</i>

09:42.849 --> 09:45.784
<i>I have my annual doctor's
appointment with Dr. Procter.</i>

09:45.786 --> 09:50.655
I'm nervous because I don't think I am where
I'm supposed to be in my weight loss goal.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.892
<i>I tend to eat whatever
Gage is eating.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:57.996
Why waste my food when I
could just share a plate with him?

09:57.998 --> 10:00.231
So mostly, it's been,
like, animal crackers.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.901
Y'all are flying down this time.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.569
[Chris] Yeah, what the hell
you think about that [bleep]?

10:04.571 --> 10:06.338
I'm scared as hell.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.774
[bleep], I might get to the
gate and be like, "Uh..."

10:09.776 --> 10:12.143
- [Amanda laughs] - [Chris] She be
like, "Chris, can you take me to Atlanta?"

10:12.145 --> 10:13.712
[all laughing]

10:13.714 --> 10:15.013
[Amanda] So, Chris,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.481
how are you feeling about
your appointment with Dr. Smith?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.883
I mean, as far
as the scale goes,

10:18.885 --> 10:20.986
it's gonna show that you're
still dropping weight?

10:26.659 --> 10:27.959
No.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.970
<i>Tomorrow, I have my three
month post-op appointment,</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.438
<i>but to be honest,</i>

10:41.507 --> 10:43.508
I don't know
if Tammy'll ever get

10:43.510 --> 10:46.778
motivated enough to do
what she needs to do

10:46.780 --> 10:49.147
before she goes
and sees Dr. Smith again.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.249
[phone ringing]

10:51.851 --> 10:53.051
[Tammy on phone]

10:53.819 --> 10:54.986
What are you doing, bitch?

10:55.354 --> 10:56.454
[Tammy coughs]

10:56.589 --> 10:58.790
[Amanda] Damn, sounded like
she coughing up a lung.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.091
I'm going
to the doctor tomorrow.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.292
Are you gonna go with me?

11:01.861 --> 11:03.028
[Tammy speaking]

11:03.030 --> 11:04.362
[Chris] You don't wanna go?

11:04.864 --> 11:05.930
[Tammy speaking]

11:05.932 --> 11:08.400
[Chris] Well,
the invitation's open,

11:08.402 --> 11:10.201
but if you don't wanna go,
that's cool, too.

11:10.536 --> 11:11.836
[Tammy speaking]

11:11.838 --> 11:13.304
[Chris] All right,
I'll talk to you later.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.040
[Tammy speaking]

11:15.042 --> 11:16.041
Bye.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.409
[Tammy speaking]

11:17.411 --> 11:18.677
[Amanda] She sounds awful.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.312
She sounds [bleep].

11:23.416 --> 11:24.749
[Amanda] I wish she would go.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.418
I wish she would want it
as bad for herself

11:26.420 --> 11:28.119
as we want for her to do right.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.422
I wish she'd do better, too,
but we can't make her.

11:31.891 --> 11:33.758
<i>I think Tammy's new lifestyle,</i>

11:33.760 --> 11:35.026
the vaping, the smoking,

11:35.094 --> 11:36.361
the drinking,

11:38.731 --> 11:40.732
<i>She has enough health problems</i>

11:40.734 --> 11:43.034
<i>without adding more to the fire.</i>

11:50.643 --> 11:51.776
It sucks to have to sit

11:51.778 --> 11:53.411
and have a
conversation like that

11:53.413 --> 11:54.879
about final arrangements

11:54.881 --> 11:57.415
when she has
the opportunity to change.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.951
[Chris] We're kinda
at our end of our rope.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.488
You know, I'm gonna be there with
Dr. Smith, anyway. I'm gonna talk to him.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.056
Maybe see if he can
give us some input

12:05.058 --> 12:08.226
on what's the best way
to handle this situation

12:09.061 --> 12:10.662
because Lord knows

12:10.664 --> 12:13.198
we've tried just about
everything we can try.

12:21.707 --> 12:23.775
<i>[Amy] Say,
"Bye-bye, Kentucky."</i>

12:23.777 --> 12:26.845
<i>Flying would never
be on the table</i>

12:26.847 --> 12:28.379
before my gastric bypass.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.989
How's Tammy doing?

12:43.129 --> 12:44.729
She's now drinking a lot.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.030
<i>Smoking.</i>

12:46.032 --> 12:47.599
<i>At the weight that Tammy
weighs right now,</i>

12:47.601 --> 12:50.034
it's severely dangerous.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.270
I'm still racking my brain on
how I can get through to her.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.974
If she's not gonna come to me,
I think I may come to her.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.821
<i>[Chris] I'm here today at Dr. Smith's
office for a three month checkup.</i>

13:09.823 --> 13:13.091
I know I've lost quite a bit
of weight since my surgery,

13:13.093 --> 13:18.096
<i>but there's always a chance in the
back of your head that you're thinking</i>

13:18.664 --> 13:20.398
how much you could've done

13:20.400 --> 13:22.066
that you should've
and you didn't.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.570
- [Dr. Smith] Hey, guys.
- [Brittany] Hello.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.638
[Dr. Smith] How are you?

13:26.640 --> 13:27.672
- Good.
- [Chris] How you doing, Doctor?

13:27.674 --> 13:28.606
[Dr. Smith] Well,
you look good.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.275
- Feel a lot better.
- [Dr. Smith] Do you?

13:30.277 --> 13:33.111
Not having any issues at work
doing your normal schedule?

13:33.113 --> 13:33.978
Uh...

13:33.980 --> 13:35.814
[Chris speaking]

13:35.816 --> 13:37.415
[Dr. Smith] Good. Good.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.151
Today, I would love to see
Chris get below 350,

13:40.153 --> 13:41.786
<i>but after surgery,</i>

13:41.788 --> 13:45.857
<i>it's not uncommon for people to
struggle with making the right food choices</i>

13:45.859 --> 13:48.760
and find time
to not only exercise,

13:48.762 --> 13:51.229
but just eat the right things.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.132
So, how do you think
he's doing at home?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.300
[Brittany speaking]

13:56.769 --> 13:57.468
[Dr. Smith] Okay.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.404
[Brittany speaking]

13:59.406 --> 14:00.605
- [Chris] Smoothies.
- [Dr. Smith] Smoothies?

14:00.607 --> 14:03.641
- Yeah, yeah.
- [Dr. Smith] Yeah, and smoothies are good...

14:03.643 --> 14:05.677
- But just-- - [Dr. Smith] ...but
you can really fall into that trap

14:05.679 --> 14:07.145
where even though it's fruit,

14:07.147 --> 14:08.880
there's a lot of sugar in there.

14:08.882 --> 14:12.917
It's easy to get down. It doesn't
make you feel full with a few drinks,

14:12.919 --> 14:13.718
and next thing you've known,

14:13.720 --> 14:15.887
you've drank a smoothie this big

14:15.889 --> 14:18.990
with a bunch of not just
calories, but they're all sugars.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.759
Now, Chris is three months out.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.429
He can eat pretty much
anything as far as the consistency,

14:24.431 --> 14:25.563
solids and liquids,

14:25.565 --> 14:28.399
<i>and so cravings will start
to pop up for patients,</i>

14:28.401 --> 14:32.170
and sometimes it may be a craving
that they never had prior to surgery

14:32.172 --> 14:33.638
and really catches
them off guard.

14:33.672 --> 14:37.709
<i>I think our main thing is to try
to help him with our dieticians</i>

14:37.711 --> 14:40.245
to find something
that tastes like a sweet,

14:40.247 --> 14:41.479
but it's a little bit healthier

14:41.481 --> 14:44.182
than what a routine
sweet would be.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.885
Well, let's... Let's step
on this scale and see what...

14:46.887 --> 14:50.288
I'm... I'm anxious to see. I can tell by
looking at you, but I wanna see some numbers.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.162
[scale beeps]

14:58.964 --> 15:00.098
[Dr. Smith] All right.

15:00.132 --> 15:01.399
348 pounds.

15:02.868 --> 15:03.768
That's awesome, man.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.403
- That's...
- That's awesome.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.739
When's the last time
you saw below 350?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.308
25 or so plus years, probably.

15:17.816 --> 15:18.950
That's great.
That's awesome, man.

15:18.952 --> 15:19.684
That's awesome.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.319
That makes me really happy.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.389
[Dr. Smith] And it sounds
like you can feel it, too.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.556
[Chris exclaims]

15:27.493 --> 15:29.794
- Yeah.
<i>- [Chris] Losing the weight feels so good.</i>

15:29.796 --> 15:32.730
You know, I feel like I was
when I was a teenager.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.132
<i>You know, I did
what I wanted to do.</i>

15:37.836 --> 15:39.570
It's all about progress.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.340
Heading in the right
direction in a steady pace,

15:42.342 --> 15:45.410
we're gonna look back
6 and 12 months from now,

15:45.412 --> 15:48.413
and you'll be blown away compared
to where we are even today,

15:48.415 --> 15:51.416
and you're so much better off today
than you were three months ago.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.086
How's Tammy doing?

16:00.492 --> 16:02.593
So, I asked Chris
how Tammy was doing.

16:02.595 --> 16:06.397
I obviously haven't seen her in a little
while and I'm concerned about her and,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.399
you know, the look on his face
told me everything.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.736
<i>Obviously, Tammy shares a lot
of things on social media.</i>

16:11.738 --> 16:15.406
These aren't things that she's
making any effort to keep private,

16:15.408 --> 16:18.376
um, and so, I'm made
aware of Tammy

16:19.011 --> 16:19.711
<i>drinking a lot.</i>

16:19.713 --> 16:21.145
<i>Smoking.</i>

16:21.147 --> 16:24.015
But, you know, at the weight
that Tammy weighs right now,

16:24.017 --> 16:26.384
it's severely dangerous.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.586
I worry about her.
I care about her.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.955
I want her to do well.
I know you do.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.458
Um, you care about her
as much as anybody.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.793
I've got an idea
or two in my head

16:35.795 --> 16:40.031
'cause I'm still racking my brain
on how I can get through to her.

16:40.033 --> 16:43.101
If she's not gonna come to me,
I think I may come to her.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.703
I told Chris I've decided in--

16:45.705 --> 16:48.473
Instead of waiting for her to
come to me, I'm gonna go to her.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.809
<i>That's pretty unconventional
for what I do</i>

16:51.811 --> 16:55.747
and I'm... I'm definitely not old
enough to be in the age of house calls,

16:55.749 --> 16:57.615
<i>but at this point,</i>

16:57.617 --> 17:00.785
I'm willing to show Tammy that
I will literally do anything I can

17:00.787 --> 17:03.054
to help her get
to where she needs to be.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.224
I know that this surgery
can help Tammy...

17:06.692 --> 17:07.925
so much,

17:08.193 --> 17:13.097
and I don't know a whole lot
of people that needs help more

17:13.165 --> 17:14.332
than she does.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.335
[Chris speaking]

17:22.508 --> 17:26.077
But I really don't know
how she'll react

17:32.951 --> 17:35.086
- [Misty] Hey!
- [Amy] Hey, what's up, bitches?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.487
[Amanda] What's going
on with you?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.656
[Amy speaking]

17:38.658 --> 17:42.060
<i>[Misty] We're supposed to be kin
to one of the queens of England.</i>

17:42.062 --> 17:44.996
Quite honestly, I think
it's [bleep], but okay.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.065
[Amanda speaking]

17:47.067 --> 17:48.766
[Tammy speaking]

17:48.800 --> 17:50.301
[Amy speaking]

17:51.837 --> 17:55.606
[Dr. Procter] Are you paying attention
to what your weight is doing and...

17:55.608 --> 17:58.076
- No.
- [Dr. Procter] And goals that you set before?

17:58.078 --> 18:01.079
Surgery is no guarantee that somebody's
going to not only lose the weight,

18:01.081 --> 18:02.346
<i>but keep the weight off.</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:06.417
[scale beeps]

18:13.492 --> 18:16.294
So how are you
liking the new house?

18:16.296 --> 18:19.897
I really love it. It's nice
and quiet and peaceful.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.300
<i>Now that I have my own house,
we can have get-togethers,</i>

18:22.302 --> 18:25.136
so I called my sisters
and my mom,

18:25.138 --> 18:29.140
and we're just gonna have a nice
talk and sit down and just chitchat.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.344
Okay.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.846
<i>[Amy] When we were growing up,</i>

18:34.913 --> 18:38.716
Mom would always say we were
related to the Queen of England,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.719
and I just wanted to see
if she was making up stories,

18:41.721 --> 18:44.455
so I had all the siblings
spit in a vial,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.991
<i>and today, I got the results.</i>

19:00.839 --> 19:05.009
<i>[Misty] I guess we're supposed to be
kin to one of the queens of England.</i>

19:05.911 --> 19:08.279
Quite honestly, I think
it's [bleep], but okay.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.021
[Amy speaking]

19:19.858 --> 19:23.194
Tammy hasn't really reached
out to me since I moved.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.296
She only calls me
when she needs something,

19:25.531 --> 19:26.964
so

19:31.670 --> 19:33.771
- [Amanda] Somebody say hey!
- [Tammy] Hey, bitches!

19:33.773 --> 19:34.739
- [Misty] Hey!
- [Amy] Hey, what's up, bitches?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.807
[Amanda] What's going on, guys?

19:36.809 --> 19:38.543
- [Amy] What's going on with you?
- [Amanda] Hey, what's up?

19:38.545 --> 19:40.111
Same old crap.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.715
[Amanda] So you got
the results in?

19:44.717 --> 19:47.752
Yeah, do y'all wanna
go in and read 'em, or...

19:47.754 --> 19:49.987
[Darlene] Nah, we can
just stay right here--

19:49.989 --> 19:50.988
Nah, I'm gonna run in,
say hi to Michael.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.956
You want me to grab 'em
while I'm in there or...

19:51.958 --> 19:53.991
Yeah, I think
they're on the table.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.193
Okay, all right.
I'll be right back.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.129
<i>[Amy] Tammy's vehiclebound now.</i>

19:58.131 --> 20:00.097
She ain't housebound.
She got out of the house.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.300
She can't go
nowhere else. [snorts]

20:03.602 --> 20:05.036
What's the point of going out

20:05.038 --> 20:08.005
if you ain't gonna get out
and enjoy your life?

20:09.408 --> 20:10.408
All right.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.143
So are y'all ready?

20:12.145 --> 20:13.844
- [Misty] Yeah.
- [Amy] Yeah.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.246
[Amanda speaking]

20:15.814 --> 20:17.515
[Tammy speaking]

20:17.517 --> 20:18.716
[Amy speaking]

20:18.718 --> 20:22.086
But you used to say
we're, like, English and...

20:22.088 --> 20:25.656
I can remember my family
reunion on my mom's side,

20:25.658 --> 20:28.392
they had a crest

20:28.394 --> 20:32.296
and it showed all of our
family history, and, uh,

20:40.572 --> 20:44.175
Okay, I am English.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.346
That's the most I've got.
I'm 40% English.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.449
I'm 38% Scottish,

20:51.451 --> 20:52.817
15% Wales,

20:52.819 --> 20:56.654
and 7% Sweden, Denmark.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.522
Being related to the Queen
of England would be

20:58.524 --> 21:01.392
the English Northwestern
Europe, um...

21:01.394 --> 21:04.695
So it, it might be true, Mom.
You might be right.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.764
[Amanda] I think the closest
thing we got so far is Mom's hairdo

21:06.766 --> 21:08.766
kinda matches
the Queen of England's hairdo.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.202
- That's about the closest thing.
- Right, right, right.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.540
The only thing with my DNA test

21:16.542 --> 21:22.113
that I found surprising was
I'm partially from Denmark.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.424
- [Darlene laughs] - The Queen of
England got more power than what I got.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.794
- Right.
- I mean, that ain't saying much.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.597
- Well, if she wants to hand me some money, then I'd be happy.
- That ain't gonna happen.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.399
[all laugh]

21:50.909 --> 21:53.411
Boy, that's not
what your bathroom told me

21:53.413 --> 21:54.779
when I went in there to pee.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.347
[chuckles] Shut up.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.892
- So they are trying.
- Oh, [bleep].

22:07.894 --> 22:11.028
[Amanda] Busted, bitch.
Just tell the truth, hell.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.733
Because my ovaries
are getting older.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.201
[Amanda] Oh, [bleep].

22:17.203 --> 22:19.303
I don't wanna be too old.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.747
I, honest to God,
think Amy's rushing it.

22:29.749 --> 22:30.614
<i>She's still trying
to lose weight,</i>

22:30.616 --> 22:32.817
<i>get herself together over that.</i>

22:32.819 --> 22:35.686
I was hoping Amy would give it a
little bit more space in between them

22:35.688 --> 22:37.922
where it wouldn't be
as hard on her.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.658
Don't you have your annual
checkup with Dr. Procter?

22:40.660 --> 22:43.961
Maybe you should run it
by him, see what he thinks.

23:02.814 --> 23:05.049
They've pretty much remodeled
the whole damn house.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.251
[Amy] I wish y'all can go in.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.987
<i>[Amanda] My mom and Tammy,</i>

23:09.989 --> 23:11.956
they have a really hard time
getting into houses

23:11.958 --> 23:12.957
and, you know, different places

23:12.959 --> 23:14.792
if it's not
wheelchair-accessible.

23:14.794 --> 23:15.860
<i>And it probably does hurt them,</i>

23:15.862 --> 23:17.595
<i>but sometimes, you gotta
push through the pain</i>

23:17.597 --> 23:23.000
and be where you need to be to support
your people and they didn't even try.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.602
Y'all need to understand
why it's so damn important.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.970
Amy's did a big thing

23:25.972 --> 23:27.538
and she wants you all
to be proud of her,

23:27.540 --> 23:28.806
and she's did
a whole lot of work.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.108
And she just wants y'all
to be able to come in and sit

23:31.110 --> 23:33.144
in her couch
and just chill and relax.

23:44.856 --> 23:46.290
[Darlene speaking]

24:00.038 --> 24:01.405
[Amy speaking]

24:05.110 --> 24:06.410
[sighs]

24:15.754 --> 24:16.954
[Tammy coughs]

24:17.923 --> 24:21.559
You are loved
and we need you here still.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.361
I'm sorry, 35 years
is just not enough.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.578
<i>[Amy] It's the morning
of the flight.</i>

24:40.580 --> 24:44.148
We're about to fly...
I'm shaking, I'm so nervous.

24:44.783 --> 24:48.152
I'm shaking.
I'm scared as hell.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.756
<i>Today, me and Michael and Gage
are going to Atlanta</i>

24:52.758 --> 24:54.024
to meet Dr. Procter.

24:54.026 --> 24:58.095
It's my two-year checkup
and we plan on flying.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.874
Flying would never
be on the table

25:09.876 --> 25:11.642
before my gastric bypass

25:11.644 --> 25:15.112
because I was way too big
for the seats.

25:15.114 --> 25:18.415
And now that I've lost weight,
I can fit in the chairs.

25:25.524 --> 25:30.127
[Amy, high-pitched]
<i>Oh, my God. Here we are.</i>

25:30.129 --> 25:32.596
[voice on machine] <i>Please press
the button to take the parking ticket.</i>

25:32.598 --> 25:33.664
No.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.066
<i>- Please take the parking ticket.
- No.</i>

25:36.068 --> 25:37.334
[snorts]

25:39.104 --> 25:42.573
I'm feeling nervous, anxious,

25:42.575 --> 25:45.843
and ready just
to get it over with.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.046
Today, I'm most nervous
about the takeoff and landing.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.315
Okay, bye-bye, Kentucky.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.785
So we're about to go
up to the ticket counter

25:54.787 --> 25:57.388
and go check in
and [bleep], and I'm...

25:57.390 --> 26:00.224
My nerves are getting
to the better of me.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.948
<i>[Amy] When I was in the seat
and the plane was taking off,</i>

26:23.950 --> 26:27.084
I'm just scared
because there's turbulence.

26:44.736 --> 26:46.003
<i>The seatbelt was so tight,</i>

26:46.005 --> 26:48.339
<i>when I breathed,
it would pop open.</i>

26:52.043 --> 26:54.144
<i>That was a sardine can.</i>

27:14.065 --> 27:15.566
[laughs]

27:15.568 --> 27:18.002
Yay, we're at the hotel.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.404
You made it all the way
to Georgia.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.214
<i>[Amy] Ready to go see
Dr. Procter?</i>

27:32.884 --> 27:34.818
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.587
I'm here for my
doctor's appointment.

27:36.589 --> 27:37.888
All right, you can have a seat

27:37.890 --> 27:38.789
and I'll take you back
in a second.

27:38.791 --> 27:39.923
Thank you.

28:06.051 --> 28:07.985
-Hey, guys. How are y'all doing?
-[Michael] Hey.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.086
[both] Good, how are you?

28:09.088 --> 28:10.354
Who'd you bring with you?

28:11.489 --> 28:12.423
Your son.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.227
I do remember. Hey,
buddy, how are you?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.664
[Dr. Procter chuckles] I got
a smile, I think.

28:20.666 --> 28:23.167
<i>When I first met Amy
over two years ago...</i>

28:23.802 --> 28:25.736
she weighed
over 400 pounds.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.805
And, uh, one
of her goals in life,

28:27.807 --> 28:30.407
not only to get married,
was to have a baby

28:30.409 --> 28:33.043
and at that point,
it was impossible for her.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.983
So that's your motivation,
is you wanna have a baby.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.255
It is very special

28:45.257 --> 28:46.890
<i>when it's a goal for somebody
to be able to get pregnant</i>

28:46.892 --> 28:48.659
<i>when they never could before.</i>

28:48.661 --> 28:50.661
So, uh, I got to meet Gage
for the first time,

28:50.663 --> 28:52.896
and boy, oh, boy,
he's a cute baby.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.834
So, uh, tell me what's
going on with your goals

28:56.836 --> 28:58.102
and where you are with things.

28:58.803 --> 29:01.405
[Gage coos]

29:08.613 --> 29:12.683
So, are you, are you
paying attention

29:12.685 --> 29:16.787
to what your weight is doing
and goals that you set before?

29:16.789 --> 29:19.389
Yeah, I haven't
weighed myself in a while.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.560
So, last time you were here,

29:23.562 --> 29:24.962
a little over a year ago, now...

29:24.964 --> 29:25.896
- you weighed 288 pounds, right?
- Yeah.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.932
You were pregnant at that time.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.401
Let's see where you are
with things right now.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.637
Getting pregnant so early
after her surgery with Gage

29:33.639 --> 29:35.572
really put a halt
on her weight loss.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.941
<i>But since it's been 11 months
since Gage's birth,</i>

29:37.943 --> 29:41.011
<i>I'm hoping that now
she's under 250 pounds.</i>

29:42.814 --> 29:43.680
Yeah, we've done that
before, right?

29:43.682 --> 29:45.048
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.188
- Go ahead and step on.
- [Gage gurgles]

29:56.327 --> 29:58.762
- [scale beeps]
- So, 275 pounds exactly.

29:58.764 --> 30:02.366
- I think I did really good compared to being 406 pounds.
- [Gage cries]

30:02.368 --> 30:04.802
Uh, you're getting there,
yeah, yeah.

30:04.804 --> 30:07.771
Surgery's no guarantee that somebody's
going to not only lose the weight,

30:07.773 --> 30:09.406
but keep the weight off, uh,

30:09.408 --> 30:11.542
<i>and we've seen that.</i>

30:11.544 --> 30:15.612
<i>From what I'm seeing, she hasn't
put any more effort back into her health.</i>

30:15.614 --> 30:18.215
We've pretty much stalled out,
at this point.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.517
You're now down
to 275 pounds, so...

30:20.519 --> 30:22.920
I'd like to have seen you
much lower than that.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.956
You know, guys,
it's time to get serious.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.591
It's time to get serious.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.961
Mama needs to be healthy, so we gotta,
we gotta really, really double down now.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.897
Because I do still
worry about you

30:33.899 --> 30:36.900
and I worry a lot
about your sister.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.368
Tell me what's going on
with her.

30:46.911 --> 30:50.981
She's been smoking, drinking...

30:50.983 --> 30:52.749
I'm worried about her
because, you know,

30:52.751 --> 30:55.085
she's not gonna be around
with us much longer

30:55.087 --> 30:57.054
if this is the path
that she continues on.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.890
<i>What Amy told me about Tammy
was disturbing.</i>

30:59.892 --> 31:01.592
It sounds like she's taking
a really bad turn

31:01.594 --> 31:04.027
since, uh, I last saw her.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.264
<i>I certainly don't think that
Dr. Smith is going to operate on her</i>

31:07.266 --> 31:07.898
<i>in her current state of mind,</i>

31:07.900 --> 31:08.999
nor would I.

31:09.001 --> 31:12.569
Uh, this is something
that just can't be done

31:12.571 --> 31:13.904
because we think
it needs to happen.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.707
She has to,
to believe in herself

31:16.709 --> 31:17.774
and believe that she can
do these things,

31:17.776 --> 31:21.011
or operating on her
is just gonna hurt her.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.281
[Amy] I was hoping Gage would
change her perspective, but...

31:29.687 --> 31:32.022
Now, do you wanna
have more babies?

31:32.024 --> 31:33.657
- What's the plan there?
- One more.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.892
One more baby.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.326
What's the timeline for that?

31:40.298 --> 31:42.032
[chuckles]

31:44.502 --> 31:50.207
- I've been eating egg salad with grape salad mixed in it.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:52.877 --> 31:56.013
- Oh, so you think you might be pregnant?
- Yeah.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.519
- So...
- Which is perfect, because we wanted...

32:02.521 --> 32:06.857
- not too far apart.
- We want them at least two years apart, least.

32:06.859 --> 32:09.893
- We want them like me and Tammy.
- Okay.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.929
[Amy] When we were
on family vacation,

32:11.931 --> 32:13.931
I stopped taking
my birth control,

32:13.933 --> 32:17.000
but I noticed
for the last couple days

32:17.002 --> 32:19.770
that I've been eating
some pretty weird stuff

32:19.772 --> 32:22.406
<i>and I was eating egg salad
and I was eating grape salad</i>

32:22.408 --> 32:25.208
<i>so I mixed the two together.</i>

32:25.210 --> 32:28.345
And it's just been like that,
like weird combinations.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.950
[Dr. Procter] So you two have to
decide, you know, what are your goals

32:32.952 --> 32:34.017
for yourself in all this, right?

32:34.019 --> 32:35.719
Because it's not just
about having babies, right?

32:35.721 --> 32:37.087
It's about having the babies

32:37.089 --> 32:38.388
and being there to be
their mom and their dad

32:38.390 --> 32:39.723
- for a long, long time, right?
- [Amy] Oh, yeah.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.591
Here's what I would recommend.

32:41.593 --> 32:42.826
- Let's find out if you're pregnant.
- [snorts]

32:42.828 --> 32:46.830
And, uh, if we're not, let's
use this time we have right now

32:46.832 --> 32:48.632
to start going back in the
right direction again, all right?

32:48.634 --> 32:51.702
So if you're not,

32:51.704 --> 32:54.671
let's check in, regardless,
in about six months.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.407
You're at 275 pounds right now.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.676
I wanna see you below 250
pounds when you come back.

32:59.678 --> 33:00.978
Okay.

33:02.046 --> 33:02.912
Let's not lose
sight of that goal,

33:02.914 --> 33:04.781
that 150 pounds
that you wanna get to.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.883
You're a different person
from when I met you.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.820
- Let's keep this going, okay?
- Oh, yeah.

33:09.822 --> 33:10.787
- All right?
- I agree with that.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.789
- [Gage gurgles]
- I'm getting back on track,

33:12.791 --> 33:16.159
um, so I can get down
to 150 pounds.

33:18.763 --> 33:20.831
<i>[Dr. Procter] This should be
a wake-up call for Amy.</i>

33:20.833 --> 33:22.632
<i>She's not where she needs
to be health-wise.</i>

33:22.634 --> 33:24.801
<i>She had Gage 11 months ago</i>

33:24.803 --> 33:27.871
<i>and she hasn't gotten back
on her health journey</i>

33:27.873 --> 33:30.140
that she started so long ago.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.943
275 pounds, she is
morbidly obese still.

33:32.945 --> 33:34.845
She's got a lot of weight
that she needs to lose.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.713
I would love to see her do that

33:36.715 --> 33:39.116
before she gives any thought
to having another baby.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.788
Set a timer for two minutes.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.824
I love Gage so much, I'm
ready to have another one now.

33:47.826 --> 33:51.261
But Dr. Procter said
lose more weight

33:51.263 --> 33:52.829
<i>before I have another baby.</i>

33:52.831 --> 33:53.864
Ooh.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.165
[timer goes off]

33:56.134 --> 33:57.267
[Michael] All right.

33:58.903 --> 34:00.137
Uh...

34:16.954 --> 34:19.222
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.026
<i>[Amanda] So, I saw Tammy
a few days ago at Amy's house</i>

34:23.028 --> 34:24.561
<i>and she just looked awful.</i>

34:24.563 --> 34:25.896
- [coughs]
<i>- And...</i>

34:25.898 --> 34:28.532
Just, I'm just really
concerned for her health,

34:28.534 --> 34:32.069
like, if she continues to go
down the road that she's going...

34:34.105 --> 34:37.040
she might not be here much
longer, and I'm not ready for that.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.710
<i>Yeah, I really wanna sit down
with her and just</i>

34:40.712 --> 34:43.246
<i>try and help her understand
that she's gotta get help.</i>

34:44.816 --> 34:46.283
So what you been up to
since I saw you?

34:46.285 --> 34:47.951
Living life.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.421
I can tell.
You look like [bleep].

34:52.790 --> 34:54.024
So who all you been
hanging out with?

34:54.026 --> 34:55.826
Rob, Ralph, JT.

34:55.828 --> 34:59.196
All we do is drink
and listen to music.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.766
Well, that sounds
like the "life to live."

35:02.768 --> 35:05.902
[both chuckle]

35:05.904 --> 35:10.974
It is what it is, but you just remember that
the choices you make affects your health.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.844
And more than anything, you
know, we gotta keep that in check.

35:13.846 --> 35:16.213
I'm aware of what
it can do to me.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.917
- Not that I mean, I know...
- I mean, it's all good.

35:20.919 --> 35:21.985
I know you don't
need me to tell you

35:21.987 --> 35:23.420
but I'm still gonna tell you.

35:38.503 --> 35:41.605
Just wanna be myself
and live free.

35:41.607 --> 35:45.175
Honey, ain't nobody trying
to make you live differently.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.915
I have never expected you
to be anybody but who you are.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.718
I just want you to be careful,
but with that being said,

35:54.720 --> 35:56.853
I got a little something
for you outside in the car.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.755
I'mma go out here
and get this real quick

35:58.757 --> 36:00.123
and I'll be right back.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.758
- [clears throat]
- Okay.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.194
<i>[Amanda] When I would have to
have hard conversations with her,</i>

36:04.196 --> 36:06.496
<i>I always try to let her know
that the love is there.</i>

36:06.498 --> 36:08.698
Ultimately, that's the reason.

36:08.700 --> 36:14.037
That's the umbrella that makes me
confront her with hard, hard conversations.

36:14.039 --> 36:17.007
You know, I just want to
plant a seed that reminds her

36:17.009 --> 36:19.042
that she can
make better choices.

36:21.212 --> 36:22.412
All right.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.950
Hell, can't we just celebrate
'cause today is another day?

36:26.952 --> 36:30.020
- [Tammy giggles] - You don't have
to have a reason to celebrate [bleep].

36:32.890 --> 36:34.324
Well, because...

36:38.062 --> 36:41.164
Um, I wasn't sure
if you even have any

36:41.799 --> 36:43.800
of Grandma's old quilts,

36:43.802 --> 36:45.335
but, you know, um...

37:28.613 --> 37:30.413
I, I just want you to...

37:31.649 --> 37:33.984
have a little piece
of her with you.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.419
You know, we all
talk about Grandma

37:36.421 --> 37:37.587
and how much we miss her

37:37.589 --> 37:39.856
and how important she was

37:39.858 --> 37:43.059
in building us into the people
that we are today.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.929
You know, Grandma would want you

37:45.931 --> 37:48.932
to live a healthy life,
a long life.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.068
And I'm sorry,
35 years is just not enough.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.572
And I just don't want you
to give up.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.573
I want you to keep going.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.908
I want you to,
I want you to stay.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.177
I want you to make good
choices so you can be here longer.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.926
<i>[Amanda] The quilt
that I gave to Tammy today,</i>

38:16.928 --> 38:18.395
I gave it to her
so hopefully when,

38:18.397 --> 38:19.729
when she's in a dark place,

38:19.731 --> 38:21.798
she can wrap herself up
in that blanket and just feel

38:21.800 --> 38:23.867
<i>how much we love her.</i>

38:23.869 --> 38:25.702
<i>There's just so much love there.</i>

38:25.704 --> 38:28.104
I can't even...

38:30.941 --> 38:35.078
I can't even begin to put into
words what she means to us.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.182
[both crying]

38:43.954 --> 38:45.088
[sniffles]

38:45.790 --> 38:46.956
<i>Tammy really needs to face</i>

38:46.958 --> 38:49.192
why she is doing
all these things

38:49.194 --> 38:50.560
that are so self-destructive.

38:50.562 --> 38:56.166
But the help Tammy needs is more
than what any of us can give her.

38:57.902 --> 39:00.337
You know, I really do feel
like you need to find someone

39:00.339 --> 39:02.639
that you can talk to
that's unbiased.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.842
Someone you can tell all your deep
dark secrets to and not be judged.

39:05.844 --> 39:09.646
And I think that that would
really be a benefit to you.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.147
And you can go in there
and talk [bleep] about me

39:11.149 --> 39:13.416
all day, every day,
about all of us.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.054
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.091
No, I mean, you say that now,
but you need to be openminded.

39:31.168 --> 39:33.103
[Gage coos]

39:33.105 --> 39:34.971
[imitates gobbling]

39:34.973 --> 39:37.207
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.209
[imitates gobbling]

39:43.381 --> 39:46.716
<i>[Amy] Dr. Procter said I need
to get back on the right track</i>

39:46.718 --> 39:50.587
<i>and lose more weight
before I have another baby.</i>

39:50.589 --> 39:53.656
<i>But, I know I might be pregnant</i>

39:53.658 --> 39:56.960
because I'm feeling
really emotional,

39:56.962 --> 39:59.729
like I wanna cry
every time I turn around.

39:59.731 --> 40:05.101
[burps] And then the cravings
and stuff, so...

40:05.103 --> 40:08.304
It makes me have some deep
concerns that I might be pregnant.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.074
[Gage gurgles]

40:11.809 --> 40:14.077
- How do you feel about that?
- Where you going?

40:14.079 --> 40:16.146
He wants to go with Mommy.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.749
Me and Tammy are 15
months and 1 day apart

40:19.784 --> 40:22.252
<i>and we grew up together.</i>

40:22.254 --> 40:26.356
<i>So I want Gage and the
next baby to be close in age</i>

40:26.358 --> 40:27.724
so they can hang out
with each other,

40:27.726 --> 40:28.725
get to know each other.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.794
<i>But Dr. Procter told me
to be careful</i>

40:30.796 --> 40:34.164
<i>because I could gain
all my weight back and some.</i>

40:54.385 --> 40:57.720
But having another pregnancy,
I'm still gonna be high-risk

40:57.722 --> 41:00.557
because I'm not
at my goal weight.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.860
And I had gastric bypass,
plus a C-section.

41:03.862 --> 41:07.096
So right now,
it's hard because...

41:10.067 --> 41:11.534
[timer goes off]

41:11.536 --> 41:13.303
- Ooh.
- Oh.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.789
Does anybody know what
the heck's going on today?

41:32.791 --> 41:34.924
<i>[Chris] Next time
on 1000-Lb. Sisters.</i>

41:34.926 --> 41:37.060
He's keeping it from me, too.

41:41.799 --> 41:44.033
- [all cheering]
- Dang!

41:44.035 --> 41:46.402
That's my big brother, y'all.

41:46.404 --> 41:48.872
I don't think Tammy's
hit her rock bottom yet

41:48.874 --> 41:50.540
and that's what scares me.

41:50.542 --> 41:53.243
[Amy] But what is
rock bottom for her?

41:53.245 --> 41:57.013
We all only know what our
rock bottom is for ourself.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.250
<i>[Amy] Maybe getting Dr. Smith
down here will snap her out of it</i>

42:00.252 --> 42:02.652
and give us a glimmer of hope.

42:02.654 --> 42:06.222
Would you ever consider
talking to a psychiatrist?

42:07.791 --> 42:09.759
[Chris] Feeling okay, Tam?

42:09.761 --> 42:12.862
[Tammy] So sleepy...

42:12.864 --> 42:16.199
I don't know how long
her body will hold up.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.034
[Chris] How's your oxygen?

42:19.103 --> 42:20.270
65.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.272
[both] 65?
