it will revolutionize the field of study.

It's only because of my studies

The same thing that always does.

When human beings make a new discovery,
they tend to exploit it, damage it.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.116
Humanity is a strange thing.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.410
We hurt each other.
We hurt the environment.

06:51.494 --> 06:56.207
It's as if humanity simply cannot live

and electrical components.

-A bomb?
-Why would a plant need a bomb?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.572
We should ask Mr. Savic again.

He actually specializes in combining
plants and electrical components.

-What?
-It's true. He calls them Smart Plants.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.955

that he is behind this creature.

to imagine a malicious bone in his body.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.694
[loud rumbling]

16:27.653 --> 16:28.654
[tentacles creak]

16:29.571 --> 16:30.572
[all scream]

16:37.246 --> 16:38.247
[grunts]

16:38.789 --> 16:40.582
-[all gasp]
-[screeches]

16:45.129 --> 16:48.590
Anastasia, why are you doing this?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.969
<i>You told me humans can't live in harmony</i>
<i>with everything else.</i>

16:52.052 --> 16:53.887
<i>We can't have parasites.</i>

16:54.054 --> 16:55.055
[all scream]

16:56.098 --> 17:00.894
<i>I'm creating a world of only plants.</i>
<i>Just like your dream, father.</i>

17:01.186 --> 17:03.647
No! This is not what I meant.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.026
Omni-Mass, on the street.
Wingspan, cover the park.

17:07.109 --> 17:10.404
Blindstrike, with me.
We've got to stop this.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.749
[all scream]

17:27.963 --> 17:31.633
Ah, thorns! Of course I get the thorns.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.685
<i>Human monsters. Protect me, father!</i>

17:42.936 --> 17:43.937
[screeches]

17:48.358 --> 17:49.359
[branches creak]

17:50.944 --> 17:55.657
Oleg Savic, I don't know what Rook's doing
to you, but you have to stop this!

17:56.408 --> 18:00.120
Jonathan Rook?
He has nothing to do with this.

18:00.329 --> 18:04.958
But I'm not the one who has to stop.
You are.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.795
You will not harm my Anastasia.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.507
We don't want to,
but that plant is hurting innocent people.

18:12.132 --> 18:15.552
-Help us stop this.
-I... I can't.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.890
Anastasia is all that I have.
She is my everything.

18:19.973 --> 18:24.645
[grunts] I know you miss your family.
Is this what they would have wanted?

18:29.817 --> 18:34.238
No. Anastasia, stop this right now!

18:34.488 --> 18:39.118
<i>-The world will have harmony, father.</i>
-No, darling. You are mistaken.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.830
<i>I was wrong about you.</i>
<i>You're just like all the other humans!</i>

18:42.913 --> 18:43.914
Ah!

18:45.040 --> 18:46.166
-Ah!
-[loud thud]

18:53.632 --> 18:55.342
My weed killer.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.267
[glass shatters]

19:17.406 --> 19:18.407
[yells]

19:30.669 --> 19:31.670
[screeching]

19:33.338 --> 19:34.339
[leaves rustle]

19:44.975 --> 19:49.438
<i>Why, father? I only wanted to make</i>
<i>the life we always talked about.</i>

19:49.605 --> 19:55.569
Goodbye, Anastasia.
The world wasn't good enough for you.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.029
[crinkles]

20:05.662 --> 20:06.663
[sweeping]

20:18.508 --> 20:19.509
[knock on door]

20:22.262 --> 20:24.890
What are you kids doing here?

20:25.182 --> 20:27.643
We heard your block
had some kinda weird disaster.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.978
Thought we'd come to see if we could help.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.486
Oh, yeah, there's lots we can do.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.698
Hi, I'm Nathan's grandpa.

20:41.782 --> 20:45.410
I've wanted to meet you
ever since my paper ran your profile piece

20:45.494 --> 20:46.995
when you moved to the city.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
But that was decades ago.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.668
I still have my copy.
Some say I'm a pack rat.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.339
Archivist, I say.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.426
Let's let the kids do the heavy lifting,
and you and I have a game.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.680
The paper said
you're a chess enthusiast, yes?

21:04.972 --> 21:09.434
I love to play. But my wife
always called it a "bored" game.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.603
Get it? "Bored".

21:11.687 --> 21:13.355
Hah!

21:13.438 --> 21:17.609
Good one. Gaming comedy.
