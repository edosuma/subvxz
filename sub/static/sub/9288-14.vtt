00:12.206 --> 00:13.696
Right now

00:13.774 --> 00:17.540
terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:17.978 --> 00:20.606
My wife and daughter are in danger

00:20.681 --> 00:24.481
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.252 --> 00:27.117
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.521 --> 00:30.513
And this is the longest day of my life.

00:54.148 --> 00:56.548
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:57.952 --> 00:59.476
Are you all right?

01:16.275 --> 01:19.176
- Who's in this chopper?
- Just Jack and his family.

01:19.244 --> 01:21.975
The prisoners are in another transport.

01:50.783 --> 01:51.875
Are you hurt?

01:51.951 --> 01:55.319
No. My stomach's been bothering me
for a couple of hours.

01:55.388 --> 01:57.796
Sweetheart, did something happen there?

01:58.970 --> 02:02.031
No. It's probably just from
all the stress, honey.

02:02.107 --> 02:03.131
They called ahead.

02:03.208 --> 02:05.177
There's an ambulance to take you both...

02:05.245 --> 02:07.406
...to a clinic where a doctor
will examine you.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.076
- Can't we stay with you?
- No, I've got to stay here at CTU.

02:12.019 --> 02:13.111
Jack.

02:13.187 --> 02:16.214
Alberta, this is my wife, Teri,
and my daughter, Kim.

02:16.525 --> 02:19.154
- Hi.
- Thanks, Nina.

02:20.029 --> 02:22.020
The ambulance will take them
to the clinic.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.190
Good.

02:26.003 --> 02:29.440
You'll go with Agent Scott.
He'll take care of anything you need.

02:29.507 --> 02:33.535
- Jack, what's going to happen with you?
- It's all right. They'll just debrief me.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.943
Hey, come here.

02:36.515 --> 02:39.508
Call them in, give them an ETA.
Give us five minutes.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.190
Don't worry, okay?
I'll call you as soon as I can.

02:46.461 --> 02:48.726
We'll be doing more than debriefing you,
Jack.

02:48.797 --> 02:50.628
I have to place you under house arrest.

02:50.699 --> 02:54.227
You'll be held here and questioned
until we hand you over to the FBI.

03:24.106 --> 03:25.539
Nina.

03:25.608 --> 03:28.544
I want you to watch over Teri and Kim.
Make sure they're okay.

03:28.612 --> 03:30.603
Green's got me doing mop-up
on the operation.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.047
Get Tony to do it.
Just get over to the clinic.

03:33.117 --> 03:35.347
- I have to get Green's approval.
- Nina, please.

03:35.586 --> 03:38.454
Contact District.
Tell them we have him in custody.

03:38.524 --> 03:40.287
All right, I'll take care of it.

03:51.473 --> 03:53.441
Could you ask them for some water?

03:53.508 --> 03:54.873
Right away, sir.

04:16.769 --> 04:18.101
Alberta.

04:18.438 --> 04:20.906
Tony's finishing the procedures
and the mop-up.

04:20.975 --> 04:24.969
I've been here since before midnight.
I'd like an hour off, go home, clean up.

04:26.648 --> 04:27.842
Denied.

04:28.884 --> 04:30.819
Come on, Alberta, please?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.219
I've been through hell today.

04:34.725 --> 04:37.057
One thing I have a great eye for is B.S.

04:37.127 --> 04:39.995
If you want an hour off,
tell me where you're going.

04:43.468 --> 04:45.733
Jack asked me to look after Teri and Kim.

04:45.805 --> 04:48.934
They're feeling a little isolated
since he can't be there.

04:49.743 --> 04:51.540
There's an irony for you.

04:51.612 --> 04:53.843
You looking after Jack's wife.

04:57.952 --> 05:01.116
Make sure Tony's got everything
he needs before you leave.

05:08.231 --> 05:11.292
Elizabeth, have we heard
from Christopher yet?

05:11.369 --> 05:14.032
Yes, but he only had
early projections...

05:14.106 --> 05:16.700
...and those were from New York and
Massachusetts.

05:19.546 --> 05:22.242
Get with me when he has
the numbers from the other states.

05:22.315 --> 05:25.410
I want to know If the Incident
at the breakfast Is hurting us.

05:25.486 --> 05:26.817
Of course.

05:29.057 --> 05:31.389
This is not what I asked for.

05:38.435 --> 05:40.096
What's on your mind, Sherry?

05:54.521 --> 05:58.219
You've got to go out there today
with your best face on.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.717
There can be no talk about Keith...

06:00.795 --> 06:05.426
...and no talk about Ferragamo.
Ferragamo's death was an accident.

06:06.402 --> 06:08.836
I'm not going to talk about Ferragamo.

06:09.906 --> 06:11.499
I'm dropping it.

06:13.210 --> 06:14.643
Really?

06:15.479 --> 06:17.345
I'm being blackmailed.

06:19.718 --> 06:20.707
By who?

06:20.785 --> 06:23.721
By some of the people
that have been financing my campaign.

06:23.789 --> 06:24.915
What do they want?

06:24.991 --> 06:27.426
They're determined to see me
in the White House...

06:27.494 --> 06:29.291
...and if I don't do what they want...

06:29.429 --> 06:32.695
...they say they can build
a first-degree murder case against Keith.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.201
- For Lyle Gibson?
- No.

06:36.005 --> 06:37.336
For Dr. Ferragamo.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.468
No.

06:39.541 --> 06:42.807
Keith was nowhere
near Ferragamo's office today.

06:43.179 --> 06:47.014
According to Carl,
who's been doing all their dirty work...

06:48.386 --> 06:50.116
...someone planted evidence...

06:50.522 --> 06:52.922
...that could implicate Keith
in Ferragamo's murder.

06:52.991 --> 06:55.119
No, David.

06:56.796 --> 06:59.094
This is what happens
when you cover things up.

06:59.165 --> 07:01.498
Don't preach to me, David, okay?

07:12.381 --> 07:14.042
What are we going to do?

07:14.217 --> 07:15.206
I don't know yet.

07:15.285 --> 07:17.480
- Does Keith know anything?
- No.

07:18.622 --> 07:20.648
And he's not going to.

07:29.002 --> 07:31.493
You must be Teri. I'm Dr. Kent.

07:31.571 --> 07:34.200
We're going to be taking
very good care of you today.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.900
- This is your daughter, Kim?
- Hi.

07:37.278 --> 07:40.908
We were alerted to your abdominal
pain. I'd like to get an ultrasound.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.918
It's actually not as painful
as it was before.

07:43.986 --> 07:45.419
That's good.

07:45.688 --> 07:48.020
But we want to make sure
we know what It Is.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.921
Is there any other discomfort? Anything
you want to tell us before we examine you?

07:55.033 --> 07:56.057
No.

07:57.803 --> 07:58.861
Mom?

08:21.631 --> 08:22.997
Mrs. Bauer?

08:31.409 --> 08:32.808
I was raped.

08:35.748 --> 08:36.909
I see.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.243
Okay.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.580
Then we're going to need to draw blood
and do some tests...

08:42.857 --> 08:45.917
...and I would like to recommend you
to one of our psychiatrists.

08:45.994 --> 08:47.792
That's not necessary.

08:48.063 --> 08:50.293
Mrs. Bauer, you can do what you want...

08:50.366 --> 08:52.335
...but under the circumstances...

08:52.636 --> 08:56.073
...It's Important for you to take
a few minutes and speak to someone.

08:57.809 --> 08:59.674
I'd like to keep this confidential.

08:59.744 --> 09:03.010
The records are private.
Only the doctors involved have access.

09:03.081 --> 09:05.049
I mean, from my husband.

09:09.626 --> 09:11.925
All right, if that's what you want to do.

09:30.886 --> 09:32.854
A nurse will be in shortly.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.154
We should spend some time...

09:36.225 --> 09:40.060
...with Senators Blalock and Gleeson
pretty soon.

09:40.130 --> 09:43.122
I don't feel comfortable
aligning myself with those guys.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.032
You're going to need their states.

09:45.103 --> 09:48.197
Just being seen with them
will go a long way.

09:50.910 --> 09:52.002
Okay.

09:55.715 --> 09:58.115
Was there something else
you wanted to discuss?

09:58.185 --> 10:01.917
I'm worried this Ferragamo thing
is not going to go away.

10:02.824 --> 10:05.225
Let me handle
the Ferragamo situation, Mike.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.626
You just make sure the rest of the day
gets back on track.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.827
Did I hear you say something
about Dr. Ferragamo?

10:14.538 --> 10:17.803
- There was a fire in his office.
- I'll get on this.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.635
- Thanks, Mike.
- Dad, what are you...

10:22.180 --> 10:23.808
Keith, I'm sorry.

10:26.385 --> 10:28.445
Dr. Ferragamo died.

10:28.622 --> 10:29.714
When?

10:29.857 --> 10:31.518
About an hour ago.

10:33.161 --> 10:34.822
We just found out.

10:35.196 --> 10:37.665
Wait, I don't get it. What kind of fire?

10:38.501 --> 10:40.628
We're still waiting to hear the details.

10:42.339 --> 10:44.102
What's going on?

10:45.142 --> 10:47.042
Are you saying that my psychiatrist...

10:47.110 --> 10:49.341
...Dr. Ferragamo, was involved in this?

10:49.847 --> 10:53.477
That he told Maureen Kingsley
something I said to him during a session?

10:54.186 --> 10:56.985
Is that how this whole story
about Lyle Gibson started?

10:58.024 --> 10:59.184
Seems that way.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.485
But he died in a fire an hour ago?

11:03.597 --> 11:05.121
It was an accident.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.396
No, I don't believe this.

11:08.470 --> 11:09.960
Keith, look...

11:12.909 --> 11:15.935
- We have to let it go right now.
- Let it go?

11:16.380 --> 11:17.677
No, you mean cover it up.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.181
There's nothing to cover up.

11:19.283 --> 11:20.648
Sure there is.

11:20.851 --> 11:24.618
Somebody didn't want him to talk about
this because it'll hurt your campaign.

11:24.689 --> 11:26.317
What do you want me to do?

11:27.726 --> 11:29.193
Go to the police.

11:29.395 --> 11:31.660
- I can't.
- I don't get it, Dad.

11:31.731 --> 11:34.256
What were you saying before
about trusting the system?

11:34.334 --> 11:35.494
I do trust the system.

11:35.570 --> 11:39.097
When my hind parts are on the line.
But when it comes to your campaign...

11:39.173 --> 11:43.008
My campaign's been on the line ever
since you lied to me about Lyle Gibson.

11:43.512 --> 11:44.911
I don't understand.

11:44.980 --> 11:48.212
You've been on me all night to keep
quiet about Gibson's death.

11:48.284 --> 11:51.049
This isn't about Lyle Gibson anymore, is it?

11:51.589 --> 11:54.217
I might have been Involved
In Gibson's death...

11:54.291 --> 11:57.284
...but somebody murdered Dr. Ferragamo
and they have to pay.

11:57.362 --> 11:58.454
Keith...

11:59.564 --> 12:01.760
He meant something to me.

12:02.668 --> 12:04.135
That's right.

12:05.372 --> 12:07.203
I was in real pain...

12:07.274 --> 12:10.005
...and Dr. Ferragamo was the only one
there for me.

12:10.078 --> 12:13.275
So we're not going to pretend
like this thing never happened, okay?

12:13.615 --> 12:16.847
- Keith...
- You don't know how I was.

12:19.054 --> 12:21.683
I wouldn't have made it without him.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.495
Just give me a little time.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.829
Let me get to the bottom
of what happened.

12:30.035 --> 12:31.525
If there was foul play...

12:31.603 --> 12:34.402
...I promise you, we'll come forward.

12:34.774 --> 12:38.210
- Why can't we come forward now?
- Because we can't.

12:41.915 --> 12:43.508
Son.

12:43.785 --> 12:45.150
I love you.

12:46.087 --> 12:47.645
You have to know...

12:47.722 --> 12:50.021
...I'm doing what's best for you.

12:52.895 --> 12:54.659
You have to know It.

13:13.921 --> 13:15.513
Afternoon, Tony.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.381
Mr. Chappelle.

13:22.165 --> 13:24.633
Looks like they're bringing in the big guns.

13:26.035 --> 13:28.436
What do you think they're going
to do to Jack?

13:28.939 --> 13:31.100
Not going to name a street after him.

13:32.243 --> 13:36.202
- He's in Holding 2.
- All right, thank you.

14:05.616 --> 14:06.845
Come on.

14:09.888 --> 14:13.256
- Hey, Jack.
- Ryan, it's good to see you.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.128
I've got five priority cases on my desk
this morning.

14:17.765 --> 14:21.202
- Your name's on all of them.
- I can imagine that.

14:22.036 --> 14:24.197
- Look, I just want to say...
- Hang on.

14:31.181 --> 14:32.773
You were saying?

14:40.526 --> 14:42.790
At approximately 12:15...

14:42.861 --> 14:45.524
...I got a phone call from
Agent Nina Myers...

14:45.899 --> 14:48.800
...telling me to assemble the team at CTU...

14:50.137 --> 14:51.604
District Manager Walsh...

14:56.745 --> 14:58.474
Where's Teri Bauer?

14:59.916 --> 15:01.178
I don't know.

15:01.617 --> 15:03.141
Who are you with?

15:03.553 --> 15:04.612
FBI.

15:05.422 --> 15:06.787
And you?

15:07.324 --> 15:08.313
CTU.

15:08.392 --> 15:10.588
Waiting for the rest
of my debrief team.

15:10.762 --> 15:14.665
We're going to interrogate some of the
prisoners they're bringing to the clinic.

15:16.235 --> 15:17.702
Okay, thanks.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.907
I'm with CTU. Where's Teri Bauer?

15:23.444 --> 15:26.174
- She was moved to Room 7.
- Thank you.

15:42.901 --> 15:43.993
Teri?

15:46.204 --> 15:48.173
- There you are.
- Nina.

15:48.241 --> 15:50.038
I didn't know you were going to be here.

15:50.109 --> 15:51.269
Yeah.

15:52.312 --> 15:53.540
Hi, Kim.

15:53.714 --> 15:56.808
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Nina Myers. I work with your dad.

15:56.884 --> 15:57.909
Hi.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.781
I'm so glad the two of you are okay.

16:00.955 --> 16:05.484
I'm here until you're done. If you
need anything, I'll be in the waiting room.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.539
Nina?

16:08.608 --> 16:10.200
What's happening with Jack?

16:10.277 --> 16:11.870
He's being questioned.

16:12.814 --> 16:14.782
- Is he in trouble?
- That depends.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.047
He broke a few laws last night
but he was doing It to save you...

16:18.120 --> 16:19.747
...so I think they'll understand.

16:19.822 --> 16:22.053
If he doesn't piss them off first.

16:22.859 --> 16:24.622
My thoughts exactly.

16:24.828 --> 16:26.956
Excuse me. I'll be back.

16:27.031 --> 16:29.932
I guess you know Jack
just about as well as I do.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.764
I'm sending someone to your house
to pick up some clean clothes.

16:36.309 --> 16:38.504
What's going to happen
when we get released?

16:38.578 --> 16:40.170
Why can't we just go home?

16:40.246 --> 16:44.149
Until we know what happened, we
want to take precautions to keep you safe.

16:44.518 --> 16:46.646
When do we get to see my dad?

16:47.188 --> 16:48.348
I don't know.

16:48.423 --> 16:50.255
A lot of things have to happen first.

16:50.326 --> 16:52.794
Some people are going to
want to talk to you.

16:52.862 --> 16:55.661
Division, Secret Service, us.

16:56.366 --> 16:58.732
Because you see,
this wasn't a simple crime.

16:58.869 --> 17:02.397
This was a terrorist conspiracy,
and you were In the middle of It.

17:04.575 --> 17:06.874
But that's over now.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.140
Nina, wait.

17:10.383 --> 17:11.542
Yeah?

17:11.617 --> 17:14.520
I don't know all the details,
but I understand...

17:14.588 --> 17:17.182
...you're a big part of the reason
why we're still alive.

17:18.025 --> 17:19.357
So thank you.

17:21.195 --> 17:22.288
Sure.

17:23.632 --> 17:25.260
I'll be out here.

18:19.633 --> 18:23.661
Close this area down.
There's so much going on all the time.

18:23.738 --> 18:27.266
We have radiology. The pharmacy Is
on the other end.

18:28.978 --> 18:31.105
- Hold on. Yes?
- Nina Myers, CTU.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.239
Is that man FBI?

18:32.315 --> 18:34.306
Hold on. Yeah, he's with me.

18:34.384 --> 18:37.081
He was in 3 earlier.
I'd like to speak with him.

18:37.154 --> 18:40.089
Sure. But he wasn't in 3.
We just got here.

18:40.324 --> 18:41.690
Stu?

18:44.830 --> 18:47.925
- Who else is here from the Bureau?
- Just the two of us.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.993
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

19:10.795 --> 19:13.730
And the reason I didn't call CTU
immediately for backup...

19:13.798 --> 19:16.529
Frankly, I was worried things could
get out of control.

19:16.602 --> 19:18.263
My family was still in the compound...

19:18.337 --> 19:19.929
But you did eventually call.

19:20.373 --> 19:24.400
Yes. The second Teri and Kim
were with me, I called Alberta Green.

19:25.011 --> 19:27.480
You did what any loving father would do.

19:28.015 --> 19:29.380
Unfortunately, as you know...

19:29.450 --> 19:32.887
...our procedures don't allow for
any deviation from protocol.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.724
I can't reinstate you, Jack.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.117
Ryan, have you heard
a single thing that I've said?

19:39.195 --> 19:42.529
Do you understand what's happening?
Senator Palmer is still in danger.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.966
Now that my family is safe,
I can help you.

19:45.036 --> 19:48.904
As of right now, your case will be
put in the hands of the Justice Department.

19:48.973 --> 19:50.464
Justice Department?

19:50.643 --> 19:52.804
For God's sakes, yes,
under the circumstances...

19:52.878 --> 19:56.246
...I had to break the rules of procedure
with CTU to protect my family!

19:56.316 --> 19:58.614
But I never deviated from
my assignment...

19:58.685 --> 20:00.847
...to protect Senator Palmer,
and you know that!

20:00.922 --> 20:04.552
I know that and that's what
might keep you from going to prison.

20:04.626 --> 20:05.854
But that's not my call.

20:05.928 --> 20:07.759
You don't have time for this, Ryan.

20:07.830 --> 20:10.356
I have come in contact
with suspects still at large...

20:10.433 --> 20:12.901
...and I guarantee you they
have a contingency plan.

20:12.969 --> 20:15.302
I am a resource. I can identify them.

20:15.372 --> 20:17.499
You want to put me in jail?
You do that later.

20:17.575 --> 20:20.875
But you let me help Senator Palmer
get through the rest of this day.

20:21.680 --> 20:26.141
- I'll ask Alberta if she wants your help.
- She's been here for four hours, Ryan!

20:33.661 --> 20:37.028
- Chappelle.
- Can Myers talk to Bauer?

20:37.132 --> 20:39.192
- Yeah.
- I'll patch you through.

20:39.268 --> 20:40.257
It's fine.

20:42.906 --> 20:44.601
Okay, we're through here.

20:45.175 --> 20:46.506
It's Nina.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.756
- Keep him company.
- Yes, sir.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.617
Hey, it's Jack.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.026
How's It going over there?

21:03.097 --> 21:05.930
They're handing me over
to the Justice Department.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.935
Didn't you explain to them why you did it?

21:08.003 --> 21:09.698
Yes, of course I did.

21:09.771 --> 21:12.297
I think Alberta Green Is trying
to make a career move.

21:12.375 --> 21:13.740
How's Teri and Kim?

21:13.809 --> 21:16.677
They seem okay, considering
what they've been through.

21:16.747 --> 21:19.011
How much longer will they
stay at the clinic?

21:19.082 --> 21:22.211
A couple of hours,then they'll
be transferred for questioning.

21:22.453 --> 21:25.251
Nina, I can't thank you enough
for being there.

21:25.456 --> 21:27.425
Really, I appreciate It.

21:29.828 --> 21:31.660
- Nina?
- Yeah, I'm here.

21:31.731 --> 21:33.062
What's wrong?

21:35.569 --> 21:39.506
When Walsh told you that someone inside
the agency was working against Palmer...

21:39.574 --> 21:41.975
...did you think that It was
more than one person?

21:42.044 --> 21:44.638
He didn't say,
but I've been thinking about this, too.

21:44.713 --> 21:46.807
Someone had to recruit Jamey.

21:46.883 --> 21:49.511
You're going to have
to work under the assumption that...

21:49.586 --> 21:52.647
...someone else is on the inside.
Maybe not CTU.

21:52.723 --> 21:56.820
The District, Division, maybe Secret
Service. Why? What are you thinking?

21:56.895 --> 21:59.693
I just want to make sure
that Teri and Kim are safe here.

21:59.798 --> 22:03.064
- What do you mean? At the clinic?
- Yeah.

22:03.135 --> 22:06.264
- Why wouldn't they be?
- I don't know.

22:06.340 --> 22:09.309
I'm just exhausted
and probably getting paranoid.

22:09.376 --> 22:12.938
- What's going on there?
- Nothing. Don't worry.

22:13.014 --> 22:15.108
I'll make sure that they are safe here.

22:15.184 --> 22:16.242
Okay, thanks.

22:16.318 --> 22:19.287
- Can I talk to them?
- They're being examined right now.

22:19.355 --> 22:21.847
Okay, get back to me as soon
as they can talk, please.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.223
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

22:27.331 --> 22:30.699
Any more information
on the backup plan to assassinate Palmer?

22:30.769 --> 22:32.930
The information that came in
half an hour ago...

22:33.005 --> 22:35.133
...matched what we got
from Division's database.

22:35.208 --> 22:38.439
- Things are falling into place.
- Give me the headlines.

22:38.879 --> 22:43.339
Three shooters, possibly hired to kill
Palmer in case the breakfast attempt failed.

22:43.584 --> 22:47.112
Jovan Myovic entered the country
two days ago.

22:47.188 --> 22:51.091
Mishko Suba, also from the Balkans,
came in three days ago through Florida.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.889
And the other one?

22:53.730 --> 22:55.163
No names yet.

22:55.232 --> 22:56.699
Keep looking.

22:56.933 --> 23:01.749
If he's connected with the others, we need
to know where he is and what he's doing.

23:37.092 --> 23:38.491
Let's leave it right there.

23:38.561 --> 23:42.293
Get the equipment in the shed. I'll
be in to brief you on our exit strategy.

23:42.365 --> 23:43.730
Let's move it out!

23:50.775 --> 23:53.006
- Mr. Drazen, it's Kevin.
- Yes.

23:53.078 --> 23:55.012
We just got to the transfer point.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.606
- What about Gaines?
- He's dead.

23:57.951 --> 23:59.111
I see.

23:59.185 --> 24:01.313
Listen, Mr. Drazen...

24:01.488 --> 24:03.046
...when Gaines hired me for this...

24:03.123 --> 24:05.991
...I told him there were
a couple of defects in his plan...

24:06.061 --> 24:08.962
...that could be exploited.
Not to say "I told you so"...

24:09.097 --> 24:12.295
...but I'm not surprised that any of this
happened the way It did.

24:12.401 --> 24:15.029
- Is there a point to any of this?
- Yes.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.704
Yes. I can fix it for you.

24:17.774 --> 24:20.299
Interesting.
And how can you do that?

24:20.377 --> 24:22.243
I've done this before.

24:22.313 --> 24:23.780
I know people.

24:24.015 --> 24:26.917
When I was working
for the DEA in Florida...

24:27.453 --> 24:30.446
...I was able to get to a witness
that no one else could find.

24:31.191 --> 24:33.159
12 hours later, he was dead.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.691
Problem solved, if you get what I'm saying.

24:35.796 --> 24:40.666
I appreciate the offer, Kevin,
but as you Americans so often say...

24:40.936 --> 24:43.461
...Plan B is already in effect.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.638
What does that mean?

24:48.011 --> 24:50.446
Hello? Drazen?

26:05.704 --> 26:08.037
Get away from me.

26:12.546 --> 26:15.174
Is there anything left in the truck?

26:15.883 --> 26:17.249
Go to hell.

26:42.315 --> 26:44.977
I need copies of this report
as soon as you can get them.

26:45.051 --> 26:46.349
Yes, sir.

26:47.388 --> 26:50.483
Are we saying Senator Palmer
should stay in for the duration?

26:50.559 --> 26:53.722
No. He's got to get out of California now.

26:53.796 --> 26:56.994
The backup shooters are in LA
and they're going to come after him.

26:57.834 --> 26:59.426
All right, leave that with me.

27:00.271 --> 27:03.138
Let me look it over
one more time before I do anything.

27:04.074 --> 27:05.167
Tony?

27:06.845 --> 27:07.937
Yeah?

27:09.781 --> 27:11.943
Are you satisfied with your position here?

27:16.690 --> 27:17.714
Sure.

27:17.791 --> 27:20.761
Because I always had the impression
you had too much talent...

27:20.829 --> 27:23.423
...to be a number three at CTU.

27:27.503 --> 27:29.631
What do you want me to do, Alberta?

27:30.941 --> 27:33.910
That's what I like about you, Tony,
you get right to the point.

27:35.680 --> 27:40.118
Before Chappelle makes his final evaluation
of Jack, he's going to want to talk to you.

27:40.185 --> 27:41.379
Why me?

27:41.453 --> 27:43.614
Because you called in
the lockdown.

27:43.689 --> 27:44.952
And, let's face it...

27:45.024 --> 27:49.621
...Nina is hardly impartial when it comes
to Jack, and Chappelle knows that.

27:50.631 --> 27:52.622
And you want me to tell him what?

27:54.236 --> 27:55.260
The truth.

27:55.937 --> 27:59.965
That even though Jack's family was in danger,
he could have dealt with it...

28:00.042 --> 28:03.011
...without compromising
the integrity of CTU.

28:04.948 --> 28:07.542
If Jack had confided in you
from the beginning...

28:07.618 --> 28:11.020
...you never would have had to call
George Mason to lock things down.

28:11.789 --> 28:13.223
Am I right?

28:29.511 --> 28:30.842
Jack?

28:31.313 --> 28:32.542
Alberta.

28:33.082 --> 28:35.550
Chappelle asked me
to debrief you personally.

28:35.618 --> 28:36.710
Fine.

28:36.987 --> 28:41.048
I have to tell you, Jack, this is your turf.
I feel uncomfortable debriefing you.

28:41.292 --> 28:42.726
That's quite all right.

28:44.162 --> 28:46.289
It's pointless for me to ask you questions.

28:46.364 --> 28:48.993
Why don't you just tell me
what you think I need to know?

28:49.068 --> 28:50.194
Save us some time.

28:50.269 --> 28:52.670
I went through
the timeline events with Chappelle.

28:52.739 --> 28:54.138
You need the threads and IDs...

28:54.207 --> 28:57.143
...to proceed tactically
over the next few hours.

28:57.345 --> 28:58.369
Do you mind?

28:58.446 --> 29:01.348
No, but before we get started,
I need something.

29:02.017 --> 29:03.041
What's that?

29:03.118 --> 29:04.779
I want to be able to phone my family.

29:04.853 --> 29:08.085
They don't know what's going on with me.
I want to ease their minds.

29:09.459 --> 29:11.587
Sorry, Jack, I can't do that.

29:13.030 --> 29:17.400
Why don't we dispense with the, "Are you
all right, Jack? I feel uncomfortable" crap?

29:20.472 --> 29:24.034
Okay, you want to talk straight?
Fine. Don't handle me.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.747
Tell me what you know.

29:28.048 --> 29:30.415
First thing you need to do
is get a hold of Langley.

29:30.485 --> 29:32.783
Have them open up
their Balkan terrorist database.

29:32.854 --> 29:33.980
Why the Balkans?

29:34.055 --> 29:35.785
The people buying
the Palmer hit...

29:35.858 --> 29:38.156
...were being financed
by a man named Ted Cofell.

29:38.227 --> 29:41.163
He was an investment banker with
family connections in Europe.

29:41.231 --> 29:42.528
Was?

29:42.766 --> 29:44.734
He died three hours ago.

29:46.437 --> 29:47.904
Keep talking.

29:48.106 --> 29:49.699
The money that we traced...

29:50.009 --> 29:53.467
...came back to Ted Cofell Industries
which Is based out here In LA.

30:00.221 --> 30:03.122
- CTU. Almeida.
- Tony, I have a problem.

30:03.190 --> 30:06.092
20 minutes ago a man identified
himself to me as FBI...

30:06.161 --> 30:07.253
...but I know he's lying.

30:07.329 --> 30:08.353
How do you know?

30:08.430 --> 30:11.491
Because I met the only FBI agents
assigned here.

30:11.567 --> 30:12.625
They knew nothing about him.

30:12.702 --> 30:14.967
Maybe the right hand's
not talking to the left?

30:15.039 --> 30:16.563
No, I don't think it's that.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.508
Can you send someone over?
I need to pull prints off a phone.

30:19.577 --> 30:22.375
- Sure. Anything else?
- No, that's it. Just hurry.

30:22.447 --> 30:24.245
All right. You got it.

30:29.151 --> 30:32.211
And the Senator
wanted to get your approval on these.

30:32.287 --> 30:33.312
What are they?

30:33.390 --> 30:35.221
Photographs for the Time magazine piece.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.282
Right, I wanted to see those.

30:38.496 --> 30:39.929
Nice.

30:41.232 --> 30:43.167
- Mom?
- Hey.

30:44.236 --> 30:45.703
Use that one.

30:45.771 --> 30:47.204
Okay. Thanks.

30:48.141 --> 30:49.665
So, what's going on?

30:51.944 --> 30:53.139
I talked to Dad.

30:53.447 --> 30:55.881
- And?
- And I'm a little confused.

30:56.050 --> 30:58.019
He's been trying to convince me...

30:58.086 --> 31:01.055
...that it's best
to air this thing about Nicole's rape...

31:01.122 --> 31:02.590
...and the death of Lyle Gibson.

31:02.658 --> 31:06.389
- Don't worry about that now.
- No, that's just it, we do have to.

31:07.998 --> 31:10.296
I know about Dr. Ferragamo.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.998
I know the fire was no accident.
We got to do something.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.805
- Keith, look...
- Dad wants to keep it quiet...

31:18.877 --> 31:21.141
- Don't get yourself worked up.
- I am worked up.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.272
Hey.

31:23.683 --> 31:25.947
Covering up an accident is one thing...

31:26.654 --> 31:28.485
...but we're talking about murder.

31:30.558 --> 31:32.686
- I'm going to the police.
- You will not.

31:32.761 --> 31:35.958
- I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.
- You will listen to me, Keith!

31:42.739 --> 31:44.764
It is not your decision to make.

31:46.010 --> 31:47.500
Can't beiieve you're saying this.

31:47.579 --> 31:51.311
Because you don't know what it takes
to raise a family and to keep it safe.

31:51.383 --> 31:54.784
- What does this have to do with safe?
- Everything.

31:56.389 --> 31:58.789
Nothing is simple in life.

31:59.025 --> 32:01.426
Sometimes you just have to
make a decision.

32:01.496 --> 32:04.727
That is what we did, and you will
respect that. Do you understand?

32:04.799 --> 32:06.324
I understand...

32:09.037 --> 32:12.201
Have Patty pack up your things.
We have to leave the state today.

32:12.275 --> 32:13.537
Why?

32:13.776 --> 32:17.577
They've done a threat assessment. They
claim it's too dangerous to stay here.

32:17.648 --> 32:21.016
- Where are we going?
- Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.180
- Have you discussed this with Mike?
- Of course.

32:24.422 --> 32:28.484
He believes this isn't a call they would
make unless the threat was imminent.

32:28.561 --> 32:31.895
I thought you said that the man
from the breakfast, Jack...

32:31.965 --> 32:33.660
...Bauer, was already in custody.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.999
He is, but he may not be working alone.

32:37.272 --> 32:38.705
There are others...

32:39.375 --> 32:40.967
...that are after me.

32:42.478 --> 32:43.536
So, let's go.

32:43.612 --> 32:45.877
Let's get our things together.
Let's go. Now.

32:45.949 --> 32:47.507
Come on, Keith.

33:03.938 --> 33:05.428
You didn't call it in.

33:05.506 --> 33:08.704
As long as my family was in danger,
I didn't want to call CTU.

33:13.849 --> 33:16.943
- Yeah?
- Chappelle's ready for you.

33:17.019 --> 33:18.510
All right, thanks.

33:36.076 --> 33:37.408
Hey, Tony.

33:37.645 --> 33:38.669
Sir.

33:38.746 --> 33:40.145
Have a seat.

33:43.785 --> 33:47.745
We have an important decision
to make pretty soon about Jack Bauer.

33:47.924 --> 33:51.291
Whether or not to pursue criminal
and disciplinary charges.

33:52.263 --> 33:53.457
I understand.

33:53.764 --> 33:55.823
I'm not going to lie to you.

33:55.899 --> 33:57.663
This may boil down to your testimony...

33:57.736 --> 34:02.003
...as you seem to be the most impartial
direct observer of last night's events.

34:06.012 --> 34:08.914
Let me save you some time, Mr. Chappelle.

34:11.351 --> 34:13.650
I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Bauer.

34:15.123 --> 34:17.786
I don't agree with the way
he delegates authority...

34:18.127 --> 34:20.527
...and I don't like the way
he runs operations.

34:23.166 --> 34:24.224
But...

34:26.103 --> 34:27.866
...since midnight last night...

34:28.572 --> 34:31.940
...you won't get me to disapprove
of a single action he's taken.

34:38.918 --> 34:40.318
Fair enough.

34:57.941 --> 34:59.671
You talked to Nicole?

35:00.178 --> 35:03.909
Yeah. They're taking care of her.
They're going to meet us at the airport.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.945
Yeah, I'll tell him. Thanks.

35:07.986 --> 35:09.648
That was the Pentagon.

35:09.789 --> 35:11.916
Remember after the Incident
at the breakfast...

35:11.991 --> 35:14.222
...you asked me to check out the name
Jack Bauer?

35:14.295 --> 35:15.523
Who is he?

35:19.868 --> 35:22.166
He used to be in Special Forces.

35:22.504 --> 35:26.635
Led a six-man team into Kosovo
a couple years ago.

35:29.346 --> 35:31.075
That's what it was.

35:32.416 --> 35:34.078
The Drazen mission.

35:34.152 --> 35:35.244
Yeah.

35:35.754 --> 35:37.949
He handpicked his men and trained them.

35:38.357 --> 35:40.382
Only Bauer survived.

35:42.294 --> 35:44.889
He blames me for the loss of his team.

35:45.098 --> 35:46.622
That's what this is about.

36:08.026 --> 36:11.826
Can you get this to Mrs. Palmer?
I didn't have time to pack it before she left.

36:11.897 --> 36:15.095
- Aren't you coming with me?
- No. I'm taking a later flight.

36:15.168 --> 36:17.899
I have an aunt in town.
I promised my mom I'd visit.

36:17.971 --> 36:19.302
She's in a nursing home.

36:19.373 --> 36:20.863
Sure.

36:22.877 --> 36:25.812
Okay, now we need to get
the estimations on that one...

36:25.880 --> 36:28.179
...and make sure you fax that
to the other office.

36:40.164 --> 36:42.395
Hold the elevator, please.

37:22.628 --> 37:23.925
Elizabeth.

37:23.996 --> 37:25.430
I can't stay long.

37:25.932 --> 37:28.196
Then we shouldn't waste any time.

37:52.797 --> 37:54.425
Anything?

37:55.968 --> 37:56.992
Nothing.

37:57.069 --> 37:59.664
That can't be.
I'm sure I saw him holding the phone.

37:59.739 --> 38:02.799
- Those prints have been wiped off.
- But it doesn't make sense.

38:02.876 --> 38:05.505
Housekeeping didn't come in.
No one used the room.

38:05.580 --> 38:06.979
It wasn't housekeeping.

38:07.215 --> 38:09.684
There's not a single print
on that phone.

38:09.751 --> 38:11.514
This was done by a professional.

38:16.926 --> 38:20.363
The grade of weapons there
would be consistent with that scenario.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.528
Excuse me.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.064
- Green.
- Alberta, It's Nina.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.442
I'd like permission to move
Teri and Kim to the safe house now.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.703
Are they done there?

38:31.777 --> 38:32.870
Everything but the debrief.

38:32.946 --> 38:35.414
I can do that myself,
once we're over there.

38:35.482 --> 38:37.508
- Fine. Do it.
- Thank you.

38:39.888 --> 38:43.757
The ultrasound showed
the remnants of a small follicular cyst.

38:44.260 --> 38:45.284
A cyst?

38:45.361 --> 38:47.762
It must have burst.
That's what caused the pain.

38:47.831 --> 38:52.428
The good news Is, It's the most common
type of ovarian cyst and It's benign.

38:52.570 --> 38:55.300
- Why did it burst?
- Could have been the assault.

38:55.373 --> 38:58.935
It can also happen when your uterus
enlarges. When was your last period?

38:59.011 --> 39:01.411
Last month. It's due sometime this week.

39:01.814 --> 39:04.578
I'd like to do a pregnancy test
just to rule it out.

39:05.652 --> 39:06.677
Okay.

39:07.855 --> 39:10.517
Excuse me, Doctor.
Teri, we need to go. Get your things.

39:10.591 --> 39:12.526
I'm sorry, we're not finished here yet.

39:12.594 --> 39:14.562
Plans have changed.
We must move them.

39:14.629 --> 39:15.687
Is something wrong?

39:15.764 --> 39:18.393
We want to get you and Kim
to the safe house now.

39:19.101 --> 39:20.227
Aren't we safe here?

39:20.303 --> 39:23.535
Everything is fine.
You're just not as contained as we'd like.

39:23.607 --> 39:25.074
Kim! Come on!

39:28.279 --> 39:29.473
Kim, get your things.

39:29.547 --> 39:31.482
- Right now?
- Now! Go.

39:47.869 --> 39:49.929
Here's the test I told you about.

39:50.106 --> 39:54.372
- I want you to take it soon.
- Thank you for everything.

40:32.957 --> 40:34.721
They're leaving now.

40:43.069 --> 40:47.006
His name was Theodore Cofell.
We traced his finance company here to LA...

40:47.107 --> 40:49.668
...from money that they
rerouted from the Balkans.

41:11.170 --> 41:12.695
Senator Palmer.

41:14.574 --> 41:17.806
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'm here to see Jack Bauer.
