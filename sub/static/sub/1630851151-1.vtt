WEBVTT

01:45.192 --> 01:47.846
BARISTA:
Grande nonfat latte for Monica.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.240
Thanks.
Uh, probably my last time.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.155
-I'm moving
to New York next week.
-Oh, my gosh,

01:52.329 --> 01:53.983
we'll miss you.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.115
[chuckles]:
Bye.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.299
INSTRUCTOR: All right.
Here we go. Okay, ready?

02:05.473 --> 02:06.604
We'll start with our right foot.
Good.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.956
One more each side.
Really make it count.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.480
-Come on, Monica.
-[whoops]

02:24.883 --> 02:26.798
LINDA:
Where on God's green earth?

02:26.972 --> 02:28.757
I was working out.
Jesus, Linda.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.847
Your discipline-- you make me
feel like a slob.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.805
Listen, can you
do lunch in an hour?

02:33.979 --> 02:37.026
-I'm in the middle of packing.
-Monica, I have good news.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.984
I may have found a solution
to our problem.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.943
-Really?
-Let's meet in the food court,

02:41.117 --> 02:42.684
Pentagon City.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.644
Subject's arrived.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.124
Yeah.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.489
Hi.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.191
Thank you.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.980
Miss Lewinsky, we're agents
with the Federal Bureau

04:45.154 --> 04:47.330
of Investigation authorized
by the attorney general

04:47.504 --> 04:49.767
to investigate crimes
committed in relation to

04:49.941 --> 04:52.161
-the Paula Jones lawsuit.
-Linda?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.858
FALLON: Miss Lewinski,
you're in serious trouble.

04:54.032 --> 04:57.166
IRONS:
And we just want to talk to you.

04:57.340 --> 05:00.212
I-I can't talk to you
without my attorney.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.171
IRONS:
That's fine, but you should know

05:02.345 --> 05:04.652
in that case, you may not be
able to help yourself.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.871
Monica, they did
the same thing to me.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.917
This is for your own good.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.838
IRONS:
How about we speak
somewhere more quiet?

06:41.226 --> 06:45.405
Miss Lewinsky. Good afternoon.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.626
Monica, my name is Mike Emmick.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.236
I'm with the office
of the independent counsel,

06:51.411 --> 06:52.803
Kenneth Starr.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.330
Can we get her
out of the room, please?

06:58.505 --> 06:59.941
-I mean, come on.
-No.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.509
Make her stay and watch.

07:04.511 --> 07:08.428
I want that treacherous bitch
to see what she's done to me.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.464
TV NEWSMAN: ...money
that the Clintons invested, um,

07:44.638 --> 07:47.423
in land with another couple,
James and Susan McDougal,

07:47.597 --> 07:49.425
in 1978.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.863
The crux of it is, they had
this land deal together...

07:53.037 --> 07:55.910
Allison, let's go.
We're going to be late.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.277
Morning.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.242
Uh, staples.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.941
-It has a paper clip.
-We use staples.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.778
Good morning.
White House Counsel's Office.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.694
Yes, just one moment.
I'll transfer you.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.747
BERNIE:
My dinner tonight,
move it to 8:00.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.619
Yes, Bernie, will do.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.056
Linda, can I ask you
to mail these for me?

08:55.230 --> 08:56.884
LINDA:
Of course.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.800
BERNIE:
Vince, are you seeing this?

09:03.847 --> 09:06.720
We're actually getting
a day of good press.

09:06.894 --> 09:10.071
-They love Ruth.
-Good pick.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.160
Are you all right?

09:14.902 --> 09:17.948
We hit a home run
for the president today.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.210
Stop worrying
about the travel office.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.561
Stop worrying about Whitewater.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.956
-Hello.
-Good morning.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.072
Let me tell you one thing,
Mrs. Bush would rather have

10:38.246 --> 10:40.988
been catheterized than used
the communal ladies' room.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
I'm serious.
What was she doing in there?

10:43.555 --> 10:45.035
Probably what everyone does.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.863
-[scoffs]
-You're so hard on them.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.213
You only say that because
your husband's a donor.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.694
Linda, her office is
on this floor where...

10:51.868 --> 10:54.523
I have to stop you.
Listen to what you just said.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.830
As though that's not
unbelievably disturbing

10:57.004 --> 11:00.660
in itself-- the first lady's
office in the West Wing.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.575
Well, how else is she gonna get
close enough to Vince?

11:03.750 --> 11:06.840
-Oh, no.
-A lot of people say it's true.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.755
Now, I'm in a position
to know that

11:08.929 --> 11:10.582
Vince Foster
is a man of integrity.

11:12.106 --> 11:15.675
If you'll excuse me,
some of us have real jobs.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.157
COULTER [on TV]:
It's breathtaking.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.813
-Your messages.
-Oh, thank you.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.816
COULTER:
...saying what's incompetence
and what's deliberate...

11:26.990 --> 11:28.426
Need anything else?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.254
COULTER:
We all know how liberals

11:30.428 --> 11:32.692
over atThe Washington Post
will spin it.

11:32.866 --> 11:36.173
But I keep saying,
to anyone who will listen,

11:36.347 --> 11:39.699
all roads lead to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.571
-Every time.
Every single scandal...
-Lunch?

11:42.745 --> 11:44.007
...seems to have her
fingerprints all over it.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.400
Of course.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.517
There you go.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.827
Thought maybe you could
use a treat.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.526
You're a kind person, Linda.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.148
LINDA:
Mr. Nussbaum and his wife
will be dining

12:38.322 --> 12:40.890
with Estelle Parsons
of TV's Roseanne.

12:41.064 --> 12:44.111
So you'll have two VIPs
at the table.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.634
If you could...

12:46.983 --> 12:49.594
Excellent. Thank you, Carlo.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.771
It's always a pleasure
working with you.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.953
Well, I left some M&Ms
on the tray.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.171
For you.

13:01.345 --> 13:04.044
Oh. Thank you.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.307
I'll be back.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.077
A lot of money earned by
our players in that first round.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.253
Let's see if they can keep
it going in Double Jeopardy!

15:53.648 --> 15:54.736
Here we go...

15:56.999 --> 15:59.784
-TV ANNOUNCER:
CNN breaking news.
-REPORTER: Good evening.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.438
-[microwave beeping]
-We've just gotten word

16:01.612 --> 16:03.701
that a body found in
Fort Marcy Park is that

16:03.875 --> 16:06.226
of Deputy White House Counsel
Vincent Foster.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.010
Early reports indicating
that this appears

16:08.184 --> 16:09.533
to have been a suicide.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.361
It's a busy scene right now.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.407
Investigators have been here
for about four hours.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.365
Of course,
details are extremely vague.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.194
We'll update you as soon
as we get some new news.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.588
NEWSMAN: Thanks, Chris.
Again, shocking news tonight,

16:20.762 --> 16:22.546
with the apparent suicide
of Deputy White House Counsel

16:22.720 --> 16:24.200
Vince Foster.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.680
Foster joined
the Clinton administration

16:25.854 --> 16:27.290
just six months ago.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.075
-He was most recently linked...
-LINDA: No.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.685
...to the White House
travel office investigation.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.397
Good morning, gentlemen.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.921
Well, excuse me,
but this is my office.

16:50.096 --> 16:50.966
BERNIE:
Yeah, she's okay.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.577
Thank you, excuse me.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.580
Linda, it's all just so awful.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.104
Someone's going
to want to talk to me.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.409
-You should take the day off.
-Bernie,

16:59.583 --> 17:01.150
I was the last one
to see him alive.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.499
-Of course.
-Excuse me,

17:02.673 --> 17:03.631
where are you taking that?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.241
W-What is he doing with that?

17:05.415 --> 17:06.590
-Linda.
-Excuse me.

17:06.764 --> 17:07.983
-Sir?
-BERNIE: Linda!

17:08.157 --> 17:09.506
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.117
Who told you
you could take that?

17:11.291 --> 17:13.815
Bernie Nussbaum is
who told me to take this.

17:41.843 --> 17:45.238
Yeah, I finally got him
to go down for a nap.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.501
He's been fussin' all day.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.766
Yeah, I got it.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.379
Well, what do you think?
Steve sounded upset.

17:56.553 --> 17:57.989
I don't even think he read it.

18:07.477 --> 18:08.957
-I gotta go.
-[keys drop]

18:17.487 --> 18:18.532
You okay?

18:18.706 --> 18:21.796
No, Paula, I'm not okay.
Jesus.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.021
I finally get an audition.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.980
Finally start feeling good
about being here.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.330
Well, this doesn't take away
your audition.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.115
Feeling like I won't have to
spend my life at the airline--

18:36.289 --> 18:37.464
God, how am I gonna go
into work with this

18:37.638 --> 18:38.943
fucking thing floating around?!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.336
I never even heard
of that magazine before.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.685
I bet nobody even read it.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.209
Saying that my wife

18:43.383 --> 18:45.385
went into a hotel room
with Bill Clinton.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.778
And then afterwards,
you went and told his trooper

18:47.952 --> 18:49.040
you wanted to be his girlfriend.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.868
That is a lie and you know it.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.219
You went up to the hotel room.
That part wasn't a lie.

18:53.393 --> 18:54.698
How many times are we gonna
talk about this?

18:54.872 --> 18:57.353
Everyone we know
is gonna read this!

18:57.527 --> 18:59.138
About my wife!

19:00.226 --> 19:01.227
Hey. Hey.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.715
We can fix this.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.109
We just got to show 'em
what really happened.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.244
How?

19:19.897 --> 19:23.510
Deb knows a lawyer.
He did her divorce.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.357
So then, uh,
what's the real story?

19:46.620 --> 19:49.013
Well, I was working
the registration desk

19:49.188 --> 19:51.929
for the Quality Management
conference in Little Rock.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.758
Uh, Governor Clinton
came through the lobby

19:54.932 --> 19:58.588
and one of his state troopers
told me...

19:58.762 --> 20:00.764
"The governor would like
to see you in his room."

20:00.938 --> 20:06.117
So I said, "Gosh, okay." And...

20:06.292 --> 20:09.164
I went up there. Then...

20:13.951 --> 20:18.260
Um, we were alone.
Me and Clinton.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.480
And he said "hi" real friendly,

20:20.654 --> 20:22.395
uh, started complimenting me.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.919
Next thing I know, he's...

20:25.093 --> 20:27.530
getting real close,
trying to kiss on me.

20:27.704 --> 20:31.273
So I went and sat on a sofa
across the room, trying to...

20:31.447 --> 20:34.407
show him I'm not interested.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.191
But then...

20:37.627 --> 20:41.109
He comes in,
sits right by me and...

20:43.329 --> 20:46.506
That's... that's when I saw...

20:51.337 --> 20:53.034
Saw what?

20:55.645 --> 20:58.257
He'd taken it out, his...

20:59.649 --> 21:01.651
...uh, his business,
right-right out,

21:01.825 --> 21:03.784
right out in the air.

21:04.828 --> 21:05.873
Um...

21:10.181 --> 21:12.227
And then he asked me to kiss it.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.492
What'd you do?

21:16.666 --> 21:18.668
I said no;
I'm not that kind of girl.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.802
And he said "okay,"
and I walked right out.

21:21.976 --> 21:24.544
I'm from Lonoke.
My daddy was a preacher.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.242
I am not going around to
Quality Management conferences

21:27.416 --> 21:29.200
-giving out oral sex.
-Okay.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.507
-Roger that.
-I am disgusted.

21:31.681 --> 21:34.771
I am upset
and I want an apology.

21:34.945 --> 21:38.862
W-Well, now, the magazine
was clever about

21:39.036 --> 21:40.603
-avoiding your last name.
-No,

21:40.777 --> 21:42.997
I want an apology from him.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.260
The president?

21:47.088 --> 21:51.179
And we'd like a role on
Designing Womenfor Steve.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.313
Yeah, I could be like a-a
love interest for Delta Burke.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.271
You know?
Maybe they could bring me back

21:56.445 --> 21:57.881
if the chemistry is good.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.710
I don't know if you saw
the film Mystery Train,

22:00.884 --> 22:02.669
but Steve played the role
of Elvis.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.715
He's a very talented actor
and we know that

22:05.889 --> 22:07.935
the Clintons are friends with
the couple that make that show.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.808
Uh... o-okay.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.811
I suppose, uh, legally speaking,

22:14.985 --> 22:19.642
this is a, uh,
women's harassment scenario.

22:19.816 --> 22:20.730
That's right.

22:20.904 --> 22:24.473
So, can you help us?

22:26.040 --> 22:28.695
I ain't tough enough to sue the
president of the United States.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.001
I'm gonna be honest with y'all
about that, but...

22:31.175 --> 22:34.091
maybe if we get
some attention on you,

22:34.265 --> 22:36.659
his people'll settle quick
to keep us quiet.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.792
You all right with
some attention?

22:47.540 --> 22:50.325
Bernie, this has ruined
his trip to the Ukraine.

22:50.499 --> 22:52.849
It's the Ukraine-- what's the
best thing that could happen?

22:53.023 --> 22:54.851
Do you not see
that we're paralyzed?

22:55.025 --> 22:56.766
We can't pass a bill. We can't
even get a health care hearing.

22:56.940 --> 22:57.854
BERNIE:
Come on, George.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.290
We have one way out of this

22:59.465 --> 23:01.510
and you're telling him
not to take it.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.425
I know you have an impressive
13 months of experience here

23:03.599 --> 23:05.253
in town, but, George,
I lived through Watergate.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.515
Appointing
an independent counsel

23:06.689 --> 23:08.256
is not a way out of anything.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.477
He did nothing wrong.
We appoint one and this is over

23:11.651 --> 23:13.392
-in six months.
-BERNIE: No, we appoint one,
and that person

23:13.566 --> 23:15.916
is under enormous pressure
to come up with something.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.787
Whitewater will just be
the beginning.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.310
They can't just...

23:19.485 --> 23:21.095
They will not stop
until they find a crime.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.619
Do you understand?
They will not stop!

23:23.793 --> 23:24.968
He appoints
an independent counsel,

23:25.142 --> 23:26.840
it destroys his presidency.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.900
You hear that?

23:45.293 --> 23:48.514
If they appoint an independent
counsel, I will have to testify.

23:48.688 --> 23:49.906
You'll be okay.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.213
Oh, Kathleen,
I saw them moving files.

23:52.387 --> 23:53.910
So just say that.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.695
I'm in the eye of a hurricane.

23:57.218 --> 23:58.698
What are you doing?

23:58.872 --> 24:00.308
They told me to
restock the pens.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.050
Oh, God. Will you not just
ask the president

24:03.224 --> 24:05.618
-for a real job?
-I don't know him that well.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.707
-Oh... [scoffs]
-I'm just a donor's wife.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.666
Oh, please. Every Monday
I have to hear about

24:10.840 --> 24:13.277
how you talked to him
at some chichi fundraiser.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.802
While I've been sitting
home alone, watching paint dry.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.979
Well, we've discussed this.
You need to get back out there.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.372
Yeah, me at a singles bar.
They'll be lining up.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.244
-You're so hard on yourself.
-Well, I don't have time

24:23.418 --> 24:24.593
with all the chaos here.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.813
Bernie is a basket case,
I need a lawyer,

24:26.987 --> 24:28.902
and you will not believe
the meeting I just agreed to.

24:29.076 --> 24:30.469
What?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.296
Well, someone told me
that the best way

24:32.471 --> 24:34.342
to protect myself
is to write a book.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.345
Really? How exciting.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.349
It's strategic, Kathleen.

24:47.094 --> 24:51.315
I'm not going to that. Uh-uh.
My client has a book party.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.362
Besides, last time I was in
a room with Lady Bird Johnson,

24:54.536 --> 24:57.408
she tried to push me
down a flight of stairs. Ha!

24:57.583 --> 25:00.063
Did I say I didn't deserve it?
[chuckles]

25:00.237 --> 25:01.369
Oh, gotta go.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.677
I think I see my 4:00.

25:05.721 --> 25:06.940
Ah.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.509
So...

25:13.555 --> 25:14.904
Was it murder?

25:15.078 --> 25:17.080
Oh, no. I have no reason
to believe that.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.908
But he was
sleeping with Hillary.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.737
Vince Foster
was a faithful husband

25:21.911 --> 25:23.739
who tragically
committed suicide.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.741
It was very sad.

25:25.915 --> 25:29.528
Huh. You know,
sad doesn't sell books.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.139
I'm sorry, ma'am,
this is a nonsmoking section.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.271
Oh, fantastic.

25:34.445 --> 25:37.927
The whole earth is becoming
Berkeley, California.

25:38.101 --> 25:41.975
So, what can you give me?

25:42.149 --> 25:44.151
Well...

25:45.674 --> 25:46.893
There's the president.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.851
-Let me guess.
-[Linda chuckles]

25:49.025 --> 25:50.418
There's this cute little blonde.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.681
She was a stewardess
on his campaign plane

25:52.855 --> 25:54.814
and it appears that
someone deemed that

25:54.988 --> 25:57.904
sufficient experience for a job
in the West Wing.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.514
What's her name?

26:02.386 --> 26:04.214
If you're doing this, dear,
you're doing it.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.520
That means names.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.783
-I can use a pseudonym.
-Linda.

26:07.957 --> 26:11.091
I sold Kitty Kelley books, till
she went fucking nuts on me.

26:11.265 --> 26:14.137
Worst client I ever had,
but she was big.

26:14.311 --> 26:17.837
Nancy Reagan, unauthorized;
Liz Taylor, unauthorized.

26:18.011 --> 26:23.146
Everyone read those.
Point is, I do big books.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.975
Some little anonymous something
that no one will care about?

26:26.149 --> 26:28.456
That's not why I'm here.

26:28.630 --> 26:32.895
What I Saw in the White House
by Linda Tripp.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.376
That's why I'm here.

26:37.770 --> 26:40.468
-Thank you.
-My job in the West Wing

26:40.642 --> 26:42.601
is very important to me.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.865
There's real money on the table.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.475
I'd be fired.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.565
I have two kids.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.046
I'm talking six figures
if you strike now.

26:54.525 --> 26:55.701
Think about it.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.140
Though you should know, you're
not my only meeting today.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.881
This week is CPAC.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.579
There's a whole horde
of Clinton haters in town

27:04.753 --> 27:05.972
and they've all got a book.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.756
Bimbos, ex-troopers.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.715
Half of Arkansas is here.

27:09.889 --> 27:12.761
You might have noticed a certain
Kmart spirit in the air.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.027
I live like I got
nothing to lose, Linda.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.334
I recommend it.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.342
I've never even heard
of this CPAC.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.083
Oh, it's big.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.824
Each year they gather the best
conservative minds

27:31.998 --> 27:34.653
in the country
to opine on the issues.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.235
Baby, did you
bring the credit card?

27:52.409 --> 27:55.282
-Why?
-'Cause we gotta buy
all this shit.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.331
My client, Paula Jones,
has come to Washington today

28:01.505 --> 28:05.248
to share what really happened
on May 8, 1991,

28:05.422 --> 28:08.425
when Bill Clinton
interrupted her workday

28:08.599 --> 28:10.427
and invited her
to a private room.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.778
Today I can reveal
that in that room,

28:12.952 --> 28:16.085
the governor made
unwanted sexual advances,

28:16.259 --> 28:18.218
each of which
Mrs. Jones rebuffed.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.046
Let me say,

28:20.220 --> 28:23.745
she is not here today to
satisfy any prurient interests.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.225
Out of respect
for the first family

28:25.399 --> 28:27.096
and for what Mrs. Jones
has been through,

28:27.270 --> 28:29.011
she will not be getting
into any descriptions

28:29.185 --> 28:31.187
of what happened in the room.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.449
-What?
-Wait a minute.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.929
-What?
-What are we here for?

28:34.103 --> 28:35.104
DANNY: Now I open
the floor to questions.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.584
REPORTER 1:
What happened?

28:36.758 --> 28:38.760
REPORTER 2: Did you have
anything to drink?

28:38.934 --> 28:41.371
-DANNY: One at a time, please.
-[microphone feedback]

28:43.809 --> 28:45.201
REPORTER 1:
Why did you wait
to come forward?

28:45.375 --> 28:47.247
REPORTER 2:
Did you have anything to drink?

28:47.421 --> 28:48.727
-[others clamoring]
-Did you have a good time
with him?

28:48.901 --> 28:49.989
What happened in that room?
I mean,

28:50.163 --> 28:51.338
that's what we're here for,
right?

28:51.512 --> 28:53.079
REPORTER 3:
Was there touching?

28:53.253 --> 28:56.386
-What did the governor do?
-Bill Clinton...

28:57.605 --> 29:01.827
...presented himself to me in
a very unprofessional manner.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.961
I would call it...
sexual harassment.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.615
Did he touch you?

29:07.789 --> 29:10.574
I will leave that-- I-I will
not speak on that.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.272
Did he expose himself?

29:12.446 --> 29:15.101
-I can't speak on that.
-Well, what can you tell us?

29:19.366 --> 29:22.282
It is wrong that...

29:22.456 --> 29:24.327
a woman can't not--

29:24.501 --> 29:26.852
[clears throat] a woman can't
work in the workplace,

29:27.026 --> 29:29.028
be harassed, um...

29:29.202 --> 29:30.681
by a figure that high.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.814
REPORTER 3:
You say workplace,

29:32.988 --> 29:35.643
but you and the governor were in
a private hotel room, correct?

29:37.036 --> 29:39.038
Why did you agree
to go up there?

29:39.212 --> 29:41.344
I just thought the governor
wants to see me.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.824
That-That's an honor.

29:44.739 --> 29:49.309
So you expected what?
A meeting on state affairs?

29:53.922 --> 29:56.359
Well, I don't know,
but I-I know that he shouldn't

29:56.533 --> 29:58.535
have brought me up there
for that and he needs

29:58.709 --> 30:01.451
to apologize
for-for what he did.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.714
You still haven't
said what he did.

30:03.889 --> 30:07.240
He asked you to have sex
with him, yes?

30:09.808 --> 30:12.549
-A type of sex.
-Uh, what type?

30:12.723 --> 30:16.205
Just so I understand,
we've all been called here

30:16.379 --> 30:17.859
to this big press conference
about something

30:18.033 --> 30:19.513
Bill Clinton did to her,

30:19.687 --> 30:22.298
but she basically won't say
a single thing he did.

30:22.472 --> 30:26.476
I-I appreciate your concern,
but as I said,

30:26.650 --> 30:28.739
Paula is not going to be
giving a blow-by-blow.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.567
-[laughter]
-Okay. Come on, now.

30:30.741 --> 30:33.483
All right, all right, enough,
enough; I have a question.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.008
This sexual act he wanted,

30:36.182 --> 30:39.881
was it something
that you could perform

30:40.055 --> 30:42.579
without taking your clothes off?

30:42.753 --> 30:44.581
-[laughter]
-We're not getting into that.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.148
-Last few questions.
-REPORTER:
Did he expose himself?

30:46.322 --> 30:47.323
-Who paid your way here?
-Did you vote for him?

30:47.497 --> 30:49.064
DANNY:
One at a time.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.023
I'll just be direct.

30:51.197 --> 30:54.853
Did the governor ask you
to perform fellatio?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.641
[quietly]:
Um, what is fellatio?

31:02.338 --> 31:04.253
-Okay, no more questions.
-Unbelievable.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.865
-Hold on a second.
-[others clamoring]

31:07.039 --> 31:10.129
REPORTER:
Wow. Nothing. Nothing.
All right, then.

31:34.544 --> 31:37.373
Excuse me.
Thank you.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.595
Kathleen?

31:41.769 --> 31:43.205
Do you have lipstick?

31:44.467 --> 31:46.948
Kathleen, what happened?

31:47.122 --> 31:48.384
I did what you said.

31:48.558 --> 31:52.214
-I asked Bill for a job.
-And?

31:52.388 --> 31:54.086
And he kissed me.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.308
What did you do?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.658
It happened so fast.
Suddenly his aide

32:01.832 --> 32:03.791
was knocking on the door
we were up against.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.794
-Kathleen.
-And then it-it stopped
and I-I rushed out.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.927
-Through the Oval?
-BERNIE: Linda.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.276
I need to speak with you.

32:19.241 --> 32:21.330
I'm handing in my resignation

32:21.504 --> 32:23.463
and I wanted to
let you know that.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.816
What's going to happen to me?

32:31.558 --> 32:33.299
I don't know.

32:44.484 --> 32:48.009
PAULA:
...presented himself to me in
a very unprofessional manner.

32:48.183 --> 32:52.013
I would call it...
sexual harassment.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.884
-Oh, dear.
-REPORTER: Did he touch you?

32:54.059 --> 32:55.669
-[scoffs] The hair.
-[chuckles]

32:55.843 --> 32:58.063
I will not speak on that.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.543
-REPORTER 2:
Did he expose himself?
-I can't speak on that.

33:00.717 --> 33:03.459
-Coulter, who sent you this?
-George Conway.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.157
You think she could be the one?

33:05.331 --> 33:07.637
-Certainly needs media training.
-Don't care about media.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.335
Just need her to sue.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.119
We want him under oath.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.381
Why?

33:12.555 --> 33:13.426
PAULA:
...in the workplace...

33:13.600 --> 33:15.341
Because he's Bill Clinton.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.082
He'll lie.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.822
REPORTER:
You say workplace,

33:18.997 --> 33:20.215
but you and the governor
were in a private...

33:20.389 --> 33:23.175
-Who is she working with?
-That guy.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.960
PAULA: I just thought the
governor wants to see me.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.223
Let's get her some real lawyers.

33:34.186 --> 33:36.579
Good news:
we have direct relationships

33:36.753 --> 33:38.190
with the president's lawyers.

33:38.364 --> 33:39.887
We're going to get you
your apology.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.412
We can't tell you how much
we appreciate y'all

33:43.586 --> 33:44.979
reaching out to take this over.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.502
Happy to help.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.374
Now, I have to tell you,

33:48.548 --> 33:50.550
they may not want to do this
the easy way.

33:50.724 --> 33:54.032
In that case, we should be ready
to go down a different path.

33:55.642 --> 33:58.166
-What kind of path?
-Your sexual harassment claim

33:58.340 --> 34:00.647
has a three-year
statute of limitations.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.867
That's this Friday,
which means you have about

34:04.042 --> 34:06.218
80 hours left
to sue the president.

34:07.349 --> 34:10.048
Well, but I just
want an apology.

34:10.222 --> 34:13.225
I know. I think, to get one,

34:13.399 --> 34:15.227
you might have
to file a lawsuit.

34:15.401 --> 34:16.402
We're not afraid of that.

34:17.707 --> 34:22.669
Look, if they're smart,
they'll settle.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.588
Before we talk to them,
anything else we should know?

34:28.762 --> 34:31.852
I think Paula has been
plenty open with us.

34:32.026 --> 34:35.769
CAMMARATA:
Oh, yeah, just-just curious
if there's anything else.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.424
Like what?

34:41.731 --> 34:45.170
I can draw it, his...

34:45.344 --> 34:46.606
area.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.746
It takes a dramatic turn.

35:54.674 --> 35:58.068
I have an idea
about my situation.

35:58.243 --> 36:01.376
You want a job;
I want to keep my job;

36:01.550 --> 36:05.337
you have connections; I have
experience-- so how about this?

36:05.511 --> 36:07.252
You get us a meeting
with the incoming

36:07.426 --> 36:10.472
White House counsel and
I tell them to hire us both.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.431
Package deal.

36:13.475 --> 36:15.564
Oh. That's a neat idea.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.399
My secretary Cheryl

36:24.573 --> 36:27.097
tells me that
you'd like to stay on

36:27.272 --> 36:29.709
in the counsel's office
after we take over.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.493
Is that correct?

36:31.667 --> 36:32.842
I bet it's been wonderful

36:33.016 --> 36:34.496
working for dear
Bernie Nussbaum.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.672
Mr. Cutler, first of all,
let me say thank you

36:36.846 --> 36:37.934
for meeting with us.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.588
Now, a little bit about me.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.808
I'm a multi-decade veteran

36:41.982 --> 36:43.766
of the civil service, having
worked at the highest levels

36:43.940 --> 36:47.292
of the executive and military,
including a stint at Fort Bragg,

36:47.466 --> 36:50.599
during which I had top secret
clearance working for a division

36:50.773 --> 36:53.123
of the Army so classified,
it technically doesn't exist.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.300
So Delta Force.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.173
I can neither confirm nor deny.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.655
-[chuckles]
-But what I can say is this,

37:02.829 --> 37:05.484
Kathleen and I will ensure
that the counsel's office

37:05.658 --> 37:09.270
undergoes a seamless changeover
from Mr. Nussbaum to you.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.403
Why is it you want to stay?

37:11.577 --> 37:15.798
Well, we feel-- we both feel
that we can be very helpful.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.410
We possess
institutional knowledge.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.020
I was speaking
to my former colleague

37:20.194 --> 37:22.022
James Schaefer recently.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.676
I'm sure you know James.

37:25.895 --> 37:29.159
Well, under President Bush,
James was special assistant

37:29.334 --> 37:31.597
to the deputy assistant
for Public Liaison,

37:31.771 --> 37:34.730
working alongside
my dear friend Tony Snow,

37:34.904 --> 37:37.298
with whom I imagine
you are familiar.

37:37.472 --> 37:40.388
Tony Snow from Rush Limbaugh?

37:41.737 --> 37:44.827
James pointed out that
one of my strengths

37:45.001 --> 37:47.177
is my high level of comfort
in the West Wing environment.

37:47.352 --> 37:50.529
I can help you navigate
the, uh, complex,

37:50.703 --> 37:52.835
difficult personalities
of this administration--

37:53.009 --> 37:55.490
and fingers crossed-- we'll have
a little less turbulence

37:55.664 --> 37:56.883
under your leadership.

37:57.057 --> 37:59.277
I don't know if you know
Mr. Nussbaum,

37:59.451 --> 38:02.541
but he's not always
the most organized.

38:06.022 --> 38:08.329
Bernie's a wonderful lawyer.

38:08.503 --> 38:10.679
Oh, of course, absolutely.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.942
I always thought he was so nice.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.683
Kathleen would drop in
to our suite on occasion.

38:14.857 --> 38:18.687
Oh, Lloyd, we should get back.
You have that call.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.995
-Sorry to have to wrap up.
-Uh, not at all.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.432
Is there anything else that
would be helpful to know?

38:24.606 --> 38:27.566
We'll certainly do our best.

38:36.836 --> 38:41.014
That you'd made a drawing
or the president's genital area

38:41.188 --> 38:43.538
certainly
gave his lawyers pause.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.497
CAMMARATA:
Very helpful.

38:47.934 --> 38:52.982
But ultimately, talking to them
even late into last night,

38:53.156 --> 38:55.202
we can't come to terms.

39:00.642 --> 39:05.212
So, Paula, we're down to
our last few hours.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.083
You have a decision to make.

39:07.257 --> 39:10.565
Is there anything in your past
you don't want coming out?

39:10.739 --> 39:14.134
Anything at all?
Because it will.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.702
There's nothing.

39:24.579 --> 39:25.667
Baby girl.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.887
I love you.

39:37.984 --> 39:39.246
I love you, too.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.258
I can't let him
get away with it.

39:51.432 --> 39:55.567
Today we filed a complaint with
the United States District Court

39:55.741 --> 39:59.092
on behalf of Paula Corbin Jones,

39:59.266 --> 40:02.878
charging William Clinton with
sexual harassment and violation

40:03.052 --> 40:05.794
of her equal protection
and due process rights.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.406
This case will be tried
in the courtroom

40:08.580 --> 40:10.930
and not in the media.
Thank you.

40:11.104 --> 40:13.280
You're two distinguished D.C.
lawyers-- who connected you

40:13.454 --> 40:14.847
to Paula Jones?

40:15.021 --> 40:17.502
How did you end up here
in Arkansas?

40:17.676 --> 40:19.547
We took a plane.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.463
What is your next step? What are
you expecting the president

40:22.637 --> 40:23.682
-to say?
Sir!

40:36.390 --> 40:39.567
What is this?
Where's Leslie?

40:39.741 --> 40:42.396
You just missed her.
She left early.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.533
-Leslie.
-Oh.

40:48.707 --> 40:51.536
-Linda, you scared me.
-What is this?

40:51.710 --> 40:54.452
-It's a promotion.
-It's the Pentagon.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.366
I've been in this system
22 years.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.718
Moving from the White House to
the Pentagon is not a promotion.

40:59.892 --> 41:03.199
It's a $20,000-a-year raise
and you'll be in Public Affairs.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.288
You'll be putting this on hold
while I get to the bottom of it.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.681
I need to speak
to Lloyd Cutler again.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.378
If this is about Kathleen,

41:08.553 --> 41:10.119
she's just shifting
from volunteer

41:10.293 --> 41:12.165
to an entry-level position.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.472
Kathleen?

41:16.386 --> 41:18.824
-[door closes]
-What do you mean shifting?

41:18.998 --> 41:21.174
Kathleen will be working
in counsel's office

41:21.348 --> 41:22.436
under Lloyd Cutler.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.655
In my job?!

41:23.829 --> 41:25.047
Well, no, not your...

41:25.221 --> 41:26.527
I mean, I'm being sent
to Siberia.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.181
It's about three miles away.

41:28.355 --> 41:30.052
A-And Kathleen, who has
the secretarial experience

41:30.226 --> 41:31.227
of a radish...

41:31.401 --> 41:33.578
It's an entry-level position.

41:42.238 --> 41:44.893
Leslie. You know
what I've always thought?

41:45.067 --> 41:46.808
You're about as sharp
as a marble,

41:46.982 --> 41:48.331
so you go ahead and drive home.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.944
I'm going up to the OEOB
to talk to your superior

41:52.118 --> 41:53.815
because something very wrong
has happened here.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.383
Linda, we tried to keep you.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.690
We went out of our way.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.953
We asked all around
the White House.

42:02.128 --> 42:04.478
No one wants you here.

42:33.986 --> 42:34.987
Can we talk?

42:36.858 --> 42:39.600
-Linda, please...
-You know, I was a good soldier.

42:39.774 --> 42:42.516
When the election happened
and these people showed up

42:42.690 --> 42:45.040
with their total lack
of respect for this institution

42:45.214 --> 42:46.781
and their obvious contempt
for half the country.

42:46.955 --> 42:48.827
Through everything-- the sleaze,

42:49.001 --> 42:52.526
the pizza parties on casual
Fridays-- I bit my tongue

42:52.700 --> 42:54.049
and did my job

42:54.223 --> 42:56.051
as a civil servant
who was foolish enough

42:56.225 --> 42:58.488
to believe that
my sterling reputation

42:58.663 --> 43:01.840
for professionalism
and integrity still mattered.

43:02.014 --> 43:04.930
Linda, you have to know
that I feel awful.

43:06.148 --> 43:08.977
I thought we were women
supporting each other.

43:09.151 --> 43:12.502
I was trying to help you and
then I walked into that meeting

43:12.677 --> 43:15.941
with my job and you walked out
with it right under my nose.

43:16.115 --> 43:18.160
It wasn't up to me.

43:18.334 --> 43:19.814
Oh, do me the favor
of respecting

43:19.988 --> 43:21.511
-my intelligence.
-Linda.

43:21.686 --> 43:23.296
They can pay me a fraction
of what they pay you.

43:23.470 --> 43:25.515
No one is auditing
the White House

43:25.690 --> 43:27.561
secretarial budget, Kathleen.

43:27.735 --> 43:30.782
It's the federal government.
The stapler cost $200.

43:30.956 --> 43:32.914
You know how I know that?
Because I paid my dues.

43:33.088 --> 43:35.134
I'm not here because
I married a rich guy.

43:36.657 --> 43:39.138
-Okay. Okay.
-Of course, that's not what
got you my job, is it?

43:39.312 --> 43:42.707
No, we all know why I'm being
fired and you get to stay.

43:42.881 --> 43:46.493
-Linda...
-You got my job because
the president wants you around.

43:46.667 --> 43:48.974
You know that and I know that.

43:49.148 --> 43:51.498
In fact, the president knows
I know a lot.

43:56.546 --> 44:00.812
The president
has no idea who you are!

44:16.523 --> 44:18.525
I will get you for this.

44:54.648 --> 44:57.085
Tripp. Linda.

44:57.259 --> 44:59.479
Let me take you to
your work station.

45:21.762 --> 45:23.416
Can I have a word?

45:26.462 --> 45:28.508
As you know,
I have been transferred

45:28.682 --> 45:31.032
from a high-level position
in the West Wing.

45:32.164 --> 45:35.210
I'll be blunt-- I know
too much about Whitewater.

45:35.384 --> 45:37.473
It's a near certainty
I'll be called to testify.

45:37.647 --> 45:40.563
I need a private office
so I can prepare.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.741
-Oh. I see.
-[chuckles]

45:43.915 --> 45:45.003
No.

46:09.984 --> 46:11.943
Hello, Nancy.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.727
It's Linda Tripp.

46:14.815 --> 46:16.338
Allison's mom.

46:17.687 --> 46:19.298
Listen, I'm not going
to be able to do

46:19.472 --> 46:20.821
that carpool switch, after all.

46:20.995 --> 46:22.170
I'm contending
with the new commute,

46:22.344 --> 46:24.042
and it's an absolute debacle.

46:27.959 --> 46:30.396
All right.
Thank you so much.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.485
Bye-bye now.

46:32.659 --> 46:37.055
Please don't listen to my calls.
It's tremendously inappropriate.

47:13.874 --> 47:15.310
WILLIE:
Can I help you?

47:16.442 --> 47:19.488
Pardon me, sorry; I'm looking
for Assistant Secretary Bacon.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.055
You must be Monica.

47:21.229 --> 47:23.492
-Hi, I'm Willie.
-Hi.

47:23.666 --> 47:25.843
-Let me get you all set up.
-Thank you.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.333
That's Mr. Bacon's office.
He'll be in soon.

47:38.507 --> 47:40.205
Just got back from Bosnia
last night.

47:40.379 --> 47:43.599
-You can set up right here.
-Thank you so much.

47:43.773 --> 47:46.385
I'm happy to get started
on anything Mr. Bacon needs.

47:46.559 --> 47:49.257
Why don't you dig into these
SOP books while you're waiting.

47:49.431 --> 47:51.216
Welcome to
the Department of Defense.

48:23.030 --> 48:24.292
CASHIER:
Next in line.

48:33.954 --> 48:36.130
God, what is that smell?

48:38.132 --> 48:40.308
Is anyone else smelling that?

48:40.482 --> 48:42.702
They're doing
electrical work, Linda.

49:04.550 --> 49:06.334
I can hear you chewing.

49:06.508 --> 49:08.206
This is how I chew.

49:34.536 --> 49:35.624
What now, Linda?

49:35.798 --> 49:38.062
There are fumes in my cubicle.

49:38.236 --> 49:40.194
It's an insurmountable
distraction.

49:40.368 --> 49:42.327
Uh-huh.

49:44.590 --> 49:46.505
Only till Harold's back Tuesday.

49:46.679 --> 49:48.986
Send FSD to set up my computer.

50:18.450 --> 50:20.234
LUCIANNE:
Office of Lucianne Goldberg.

50:20.408 --> 50:21.931
Who, may I ask, is calling?

50:22.106 --> 50:25.587
Uh, this is the civil servant.

50:25.761 --> 50:27.894
From the White House
Counsel's Office.

50:28.938 --> 50:30.592
She'll know who it is.

50:30.766 --> 50:33.595
Linda, it's me.
[chuckles]

50:33.769 --> 50:35.728
My new secretary was a disaster.

50:35.902 --> 50:37.817
I fired her an hour ago.

50:37.991 --> 50:40.863
So, long time, no speak.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.257
What could possibly be going on?

50:43.431 --> 50:45.999
I'm ready to write the book.

50:46.173 --> 50:49.437
About my time
in the White House.

50:49.611 --> 50:52.179
Dear, it brings me
no pleasure to say this,

50:52.353 --> 50:54.312
but you missed the moment.

50:54.486 --> 50:56.618
Everyone's done
their Clinton book.

50:56.792 --> 50:59.882
Every staffer, every aide,
every Appalachian broad

51:00.057 --> 51:03.060
in whom he deposited
his genetic material.

51:03.234 --> 51:06.411
That genre alone could fill
half a Barnes & Noble.

51:06.585 --> 51:11.111
Well, no one's done anything
of any substance about Vince.

51:11.285 --> 51:14.810
Vince? Vince Foster?
Linda, no one cares anymore.

51:14.984 --> 51:17.117
I can sell almost anything,

51:17.291 --> 51:19.772
but I can't sell
stale White House gossip;

51:19.946 --> 51:21.861
that market's so saturated.

51:22.035 --> 51:23.515
-I need something...
-Something current.

51:23.689 --> 51:24.516
Not just current.

51:24.690 --> 51:26.039
Current and inside.

51:26.213 --> 51:28.085
And I mean insideinside.

51:28.259 --> 51:30.609
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

51:30.783 --> 51:33.525
but that is not you
at this point.

52:07.602 --> 52:10.388
Carl, this isn't right.

52:10.562 --> 52:14.000
I need the number for
the admiral's flag aide.

52:14.174 --> 52:15.828
Goddamn it.

52:16.872 --> 52:19.005
Carl, did you hear me?

52:19.179 --> 52:21.312
I love your poster.

52:23.531 --> 52:25.533
Oh, well, this isn't my office.

52:25.707 --> 52:27.927
There are fumes in my cubicle.

52:33.411 --> 52:34.934
What's happening?

52:36.370 --> 52:37.632
Do you work here?

52:37.806 --> 52:40.331
Oh, um, yeah.

52:40.505 --> 52:42.985
Uh, temporarily.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.596
I'm Monica.

52:44.770 --> 52:46.424
I just got transferred
from the White House.

52:49.078 --> 52:50.732
Where in the White House?

52:50.906 --> 52:52.995
Kind of all over--
East Wing, West Wing.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.867
I started as an intern
and then I got hired

52:55.041 --> 52:56.782
by Legislative Affairs.

53:03.005 --> 53:04.616
We're out of creamer.

53:07.401 --> 53:10.012
You must be someone's pet rock.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.666
-What's a pet rock?
-It just means

53:11.840 --> 53:13.755
somebody in the White House
is looking out for you.

53:13.929 --> 53:15.670
It doesn't feel like it.

53:15.844 --> 53:17.411
Confidential assistant
to the assistant secretary.

53:17.585 --> 53:19.413
And you're so young.

53:19.587 --> 53:20.719
I'm about to turn 23.

53:20.893 --> 53:22.851
-That's not young?
-Not to me.

53:23.025 --> 53:24.375
Oh, God, of course not.
Look at you.

53:24.549 --> 53:26.420
You have the life experience
of a zygote.

53:26.594 --> 53:29.206
Just know, not a few people
in that office covet your job.

53:29.380 --> 53:32.774
[sighs] Well, they can have it.
I'm going back in a few months.

53:32.948 --> 53:36.300
-To the White House?
-Not like it was my idea.

53:36.474 --> 53:38.650
Why did they transfer you?

53:39.999 --> 53:43.959
Um, I don't know.
It's a whole thing.

53:45.222 --> 53:47.441
I just wish I'd brought
from home.

53:47.615 --> 53:50.009
Weight Watchers makes these
amazing meals you can microwave.

53:50.183 --> 53:52.141
Oh, I have seen those
at Safeway.

53:52.316 --> 53:54.274
They're low-fat, so you don't
want to kill yourself later.

53:54.448 --> 53:55.928
-Oh, like you need to worry.
-Are you kidding?

53:56.102 --> 53:57.625
-You're gorgeous.
-Ugh.

53:57.799 --> 53:59.018
Not in Beverly Hills.

53:59.192 --> 54:00.715
Second grade,
they called me Big Mac.

54:00.889 --> 54:03.501
My high school,
they called me Gus.

54:04.719 --> 54:05.938
Gus?

54:06.112 --> 54:08.723
[laughs]
Why? What does that mean?

54:08.897 --> 54:12.597
I don't know.
Nobody ever explained.

54:14.642 --> 54:16.514
Well, joke's on them, Linda.

54:16.688 --> 54:18.559
Look at us.
We're on top of the world.

54:18.733 --> 54:21.649
-[laughs]
-Oh, just kidding.

54:21.823 --> 54:23.825
I cried myself to sleep
every night this week.

54:23.999 --> 54:25.262
I don't want to be here.

54:25.436 --> 54:27.351
No one wants to be here,
but listen,

54:27.525 --> 54:31.485
if I can put on my wisdom hat,
you said this was temporary.

54:31.659 --> 54:34.009
You know?
I can tell you're very bright.

54:34.183 --> 54:36.360
-So bright, I got myself exiled.
-Temporarily.

54:36.534 --> 54:38.536
You can endure anything
knowing it has an end.

54:38.710 --> 54:40.668
I know there's nowhere
like the West Wing.

54:40.842 --> 54:43.497
Believe me, I know.

54:43.671 --> 54:45.499
Where were you
when you were there?

54:45.673 --> 54:47.545
My last stop was
the counsel's office.

54:47.719 --> 54:49.373
We touched everything
at a very high level.

54:49.547 --> 54:52.027
I was the last person
to see Vince Foster alive.

54:52.201 --> 54:54.160
-Oh, wow.
-Before that,

54:54.334 --> 54:56.858
during Bush, I was on a desk
right outside the Oval.

54:57.032 --> 54:58.469
Why was I sent
to the counsel's office?

54:58.643 --> 55:00.471
Well, back in '93,
I was very trim.

55:00.645 --> 55:02.342
I have reason to believe
that Hillary didn't want me

55:02.516 --> 55:05.214
near the president,
if you know what I mean.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.391
Of course, nothing was worse
than the day I was sent here.

55:07.565 --> 55:10.045
Stabbed in the back by
a fair-weather friend.

55:10.219 --> 55:12.526
I won't say more.
[scoffs]

55:12.700 --> 55:14.093
Sounds awful.

55:14.267 --> 55:16.138
It was.

55:16.313 --> 55:18.924
It was.
Loyalty is very important to me.

55:19.098 --> 55:22.493
Fair-weather or not, I miss
having friends in Washington.

55:22.667 --> 55:24.582
Most of my intern class
left town

55:24.756 --> 55:28.586
when they weren't hired
and D.C. gets lonely fast.

55:28.760 --> 55:32.024
Well, now you and I
can be miserable together.

55:34.156 --> 55:37.682
Although, have to say,
you're such a knockout,

55:37.856 --> 55:40.467
I just assumed you'd be
dating some big D.C. player.

55:40.641 --> 55:42.556
-Ah...
-What?

55:42.730 --> 55:45.037
-I'm not dating.
-Why not?

55:46.778 --> 55:48.127
I'm kind of in something.

55:48.301 --> 55:50.042
And yet you feel lonely.

55:50.216 --> 55:51.652
Yes, affirmative.

55:51.826 --> 55:53.611
Well, that's no good.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.310
Tell me about him.

55:58.529 --> 56:02.750
It's, uh, it's just he's,
um, unavailable.

56:02.924 --> 56:04.622
Someone long-distance.

56:05.666 --> 56:07.059
Someone from work.

56:09.496 --> 56:11.150
Someone important?

56:13.500 --> 56:16.155
Is that why they sent you here?

56:17.765 --> 56:19.550
We should get back, right?

56:19.724 --> 56:21.421
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

56:21.595 --> 56:23.771
-Mm, tell me.
-That's Stephen.

56:23.945 --> 56:26.557
Some major
custody battle going on.

56:26.731 --> 56:29.603
Willie is a schmuck.
He's completely ineffective.

56:29.777 --> 56:31.039
Hi, Brenda.

56:32.171 --> 56:35.566
She's going to loathe you since
you're pretty and connected.

56:35.740 --> 56:36.958
That's Colleen.

56:37.132 --> 56:38.656
Apparently,
she's got the herps--

56:38.830 --> 56:40.135
both upstairs and down.
And you know what?

56:40.309 --> 56:41.833
She's also from Los Angeles.

56:42.007 --> 56:43.312
-Oh, really? Where?
-I think she said Glendale.

56:43.487 --> 56:46.098
-Is that it?
-Glendale's never it.

56:47.316 --> 56:48.927
Okay, now that's Susan,
my cubicle mate.

56:49.101 --> 56:50.450
She's sick.

56:50.624 --> 56:52.670
-Oh, no.
-No, I-I mean she's deranged.

56:52.844 --> 56:55.107
Don't make eye contact.
Monica, don't.

56:55.281 --> 56:57.370
Okay, this is me.

56:57.544 --> 56:59.328
Oh. Well, you know where I am.

56:59.503 --> 57:01.069
[sighs]
Almost neighbors.

57:01.243 --> 57:02.767
I should really get back to it.

57:02.941 --> 57:05.247
Look at all the rules
they have about printers.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.554
Look at you, busy bee.

57:07.728 --> 57:09.774
What are you doing
on your calendar?

57:09.948 --> 57:11.166
MONICA:
Oh... [chuckles]

57:11.340 --> 57:12.690
[quietly]:
I-I'm insane.

57:24.179 --> 57:25.442
It's a countdown.

57:30.664 --> 57:32.361
That's when you go back.

57:33.624 --> 57:35.016
I have been
dreading this so much,

57:35.190 --> 57:37.541
but I feel so much better
after today.

57:38.585 --> 57:40.631
You know,

57:40.805 --> 57:44.504
I have always wanted to try
the, um, after-work specials

57:44.678 --> 57:47.942
over by Pentagon City.
You want to get a drink?

57:48.116 --> 57:50.162
I can't tonight. Maybe Monday?

57:51.163 --> 57:52.991
Sure.

57:53.165 --> 57:54.645
It's a date.

59:00.232 --> 59:01.886
What you got?

59:02.060 --> 59:05.106
What's your definition
of insideinside?

59:07.848 --> 59:09.415
-Hello?
-BILL: Hey.

59:11.765 --> 59:13.419
Hi, handsome.

59:15.290 --> 59:17.510
How was your first day?

1:00:42.726 --> 1:00:45.511
