00:14.240 --> 00:18.240
People of America,
you wake up today to a different world.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.720
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
"Wake up today to a different world."

00:24.880 --> 00:28.160
Do we take that literally?
He'll set off the warhead before dawn?

00:28.440 --> 00:30.480
A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian

00:30.560 --> 00:35.080
secured a hard drive belonging
to one of Marwan's associates.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.400
It may contain information
that could lead us to the warhead.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.160
I'll give you full authority to act as my proxy
whenever you think it's necessary.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.520
Mr Koo. There's a man in your consulate
by the name of Lee Jong.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.240
We need to take Mr Lee into custody
immediately for questioning.

00:50.320 --> 00:54.880
Mr Lee is a Chinese citizen. I can't hand him
over to you without going through channels.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.720
Jack. Is there any doubt in your
mind that Lee is working with Marwan?

00:59.800 --> 01:02.520
No, sir. The emails he sent
left no room for doubt.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.840
Then we have to get Lee now
and find out what he knows.

01:04.920 --> 01:05.720
Yes, sir.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.760
No one connected with the government can
admit to knowing anything about this. Ever.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.200
" I got him. Hostiles in pursuit.
Bring up the van.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.480
" Let's go.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.040
Mr President. The consul is dead.

01:22.120 --> 01:27.600
He was shot when armed men broke into this
building and took Mr Lee with them by force.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.640
Mr Lee. Tell me where Habib Marwan is.
Dammit, we're losing him.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.880
What is it?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.960
We can drain off the fluid,
but we gotta get him to surgery now.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.800
" Jack, what's going on?

01:40.880 --> 01:44.080
This is our only connection
to a stolen warhead. Save him.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.520
- I already have a patient.
- You have a new one.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.880
If you don't save him, millions will die.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.520
- Jack!
- I have my orders. I'm doing my job.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.800
" Paul's crashing.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.080
Jack. He's dead.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.520
Jack, you son of a bitch!
You killed him!

02:12.840 --> 02:15.960
- " Gauze.
- Is he gonna make it?

02:16.040 --> 02:18.400
- We'll do our best.
- I just need him long enough

02:18.480 --> 02:20.480
to get the information about Marwan.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.600
I know, Jack. You made me aware of that
when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.360
One milligram atropine.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.440
- What is it?
- I don't have time now.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.760
- OK, Jack, we need to leave.
- " Tape.

02:31.840 --> 02:37.160
" I'm gonna have
a milligram of atropine standing by.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.800
- " Gauze.
- " Gauze. Want me to run this in now?

02:40.880 --> 02:42.800
I'll be right outside.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.520
I'm sorry.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.960
I'm so sorry.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.360
How could you?

03:19.440 --> 03:22.120
How could you kill him, Jack?
How could you do it?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.800
- Come here. Come here.
- No...

03:30.920 --> 03:32.920
No... No, Jack, I can't...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.760
I can't be near you right now.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.560
Please, Audrey.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.440
Just tell me what you want me to do.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.040
Leave. I want you to leave, Jack.

04:32.160 --> 04:37.240
Jack, call the White House right away. Mike
Novick needs to speak with you. It's urgent.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.440
OK, fine.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.000
What?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.840
Paul Raines just died.

04:43.920 --> 04:49.640
There was only one doctor, and I had to make
a choice between Lee's life and Paul's.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.520
And I chose Lee.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.560
You did the right thing, Jack.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.720
You OK?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.640
No, I'm not OK.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.920
I'm sorry. Just tell me
when Lee's out of surgery.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.320
I will.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.640
- " Mike Novick's office."
- This is Jack Bauer.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.280
Please hold.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.360
Hello, Jack. Have you gotten
anything useful out of Lee?

05:27.440 --> 05:30.320
- No, he's still in surgery.
- How's that coming along?

05:30.400 --> 05:35.800
- Not great, but he's hanging in there.
- We took a huge risk getting this guy

05:35.880 --> 05:38.360
on the assumption
he can help us find the warhead.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.800
Trust me, Mike, I know.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.320
- And we also have a new situation.
- What is it?

05:44.400 --> 05:48.920
When you broke into the Chinese consulate,
Koo Yin, the consul, was shot.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.200
That's not possible. My men never fired.

05:51.280 --> 05:55.520
Then he was accidentally hit
by one of his own people.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.480
- How badly was he hurt?
- He died, Jack.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.880
- Oh, my God.
- "Talk to the members of your team."

06:05.960 --> 06:10.440
Make sure that each one of them has an alibi
for where they were during the ambush.

06:10.520 --> 06:14.680
- OK.
- This is an extremely incendiary situation.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.880
I'm about to talk to President Palmer now.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.200
We're trying to avoid
a serious confrontation with China.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.680
We'll handle it from here. Thanks, Mike.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.880
How did this happen?

06:46.160 --> 06:48.240
The network security module lit up.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.440
- Someone's trying to jam our servers.
- Could this be a high network load?

06:52.520 --> 06:55.640
No, it's a denial of service attempt.
What do you want me to do?

06:55.720 --> 06:58.680
- Did it do any damage?
- No, the system is self-defending.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.320
Use the Security Auditor tool,
it'll lead us to Marwan's network.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.600
That was my point from the start.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.920
Chloe.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.520
We're in active code. We don't have time for
your personality disorder. You understand?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.960
Chloe? Yes or no?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.480
Yes, sir.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.680
- "This is Yasir."
- Is the warhead in place?

07:25.760 --> 07:29.600
- Yes, but I can't jam their satellite.
- "You assured me you could handle it."

07:29.680 --> 07:34.520
CTU must have just installed new software.
This wasn't in place last week.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.080
We move our schedule forward by an hour.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.480
There won't be as many casualties
if people aren't at work.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.040
If you can'tjam their satellite signal,
they'll find us.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.520
- We can't let that happen.
- "I understand."

07:48.800 --> 07:51.160
How long do we keep
the president in the dark?

07:51.240 --> 07:55.160
Eventually he'll find out that you
authorised the raid on the consulate.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.040
We have to keep it from him
as long as we can.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.400
- Were you able to find Jack?
- Yes, he's back at CTU.

08:01.480 --> 08:06.200
The man they grabbed at the consulate,
Lee Jong, is still in surgery.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.360
- Was he able to tell us anything?
- No.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.320
- What did Jack say about the consul's death?
- It wasn't our people who fired.

08:15.400 --> 08:20.440
Chinese won't care.
He died as a result of our trespass.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.600
We have to construct a scenario that
doesn't implicate the US government.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.880
They must know we did this.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.240
We called them about Lee Jong
half an hour before the abduction.

08:30.320 --> 08:35.200
The Chinese don't want a confrontation
any more than we do.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.440
If we can create plausible deniability,
they may play along.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.520
How do we do that?

08:43.799 --> 08:47.640
Call CTU. Have them find out
which anti-Chinese factions

08:47.720 --> 08:50.760
have attacked their consulates
in the last five years.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.520
Most of these groups
you're talking about are Asian extremists.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.920
Bauer's team was predominantly American.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.240
Bauer's team was masked.
No one saw their faces.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.120
Curtis, come here.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.400
The Chinese consul was shot
and killed during Lee's extraction.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.760
- How? We never got a shot off.
- It must have been friendly fire.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.040
We've gotta make our alibis cross-check.

10:35.120 --> 10:39.600
No one outside of this operation is to know
we were near the Chinese consulate.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.720
- Jack, are we gonna be brought into this?
- I don't know yet.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.560
All I know is, now that the consul's
been killed, everything's changed.

10:46.640 --> 10:51.520
It's our responsibility to make sure the
US government is never implicated in this.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.440
Don't worry, Jack.
Everyone here gets it.

10:54.520 --> 10:59.000
- OK. Curtis, you advise the rest of the team.
- You got it.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.720
Yasir.

11:07.800 --> 11:12.520
They're ready for you to make the changes.
Do you think they'll find us before we launch?

11:12.600 --> 11:16.520
Not if I move up the launch.
They're looking for the warhead in their cities.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.840
They have no idea that
it's going to be delivered by missile.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.600
- "Morrison?"
- Yes, sir?

11:23.680 --> 11:28.320
Open up the guidance firmware.
I'm going to upload a new instruction set.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.800
Yes, sir.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.240
OK, go ahead.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.080
We'll be ready to start the launch
as soon as I've reprogrammed the onboard.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.720
Good.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.920
Prep your databases.
When Lee come to, we have to move quickly.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.560
- What about the warhead?
- We're meeting on it now.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.720
I need you to free up a server
for a large DOD block transfer,

12:14.800 --> 12:17.440
through a locked channel from Heller's office.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.960
Has that been authorised?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.800
No, not yet. I still have to talk to Audrey.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.520
- Well, that's gonna be weird.
- What?

12:26.600 --> 12:30.440
Talking to Audrey. You had to do
what you did and her husband died.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.960
- Probably destroyed your relationship...
- Free up the server.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.200
OK.

12:37.360 --> 12:43.960
Jack, I just want you to know, if you ever need
anyone to talk to, as a friend, I'm here for you.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.520
Not now, but later.
When things calm down.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.680
Thanks.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.160
Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.760
I need you to authorise a block transfer.

13:01.840 --> 13:06.920
We need all pertinent DOD databases
sent over here to CTU.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.280
Were you able to keep Lee alive?

13:10.360 --> 13:13.040
Yeah, he's stabilised.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.640
All right. I'll call Marcy.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.200
Thank you.

13:21.960 --> 13:26.360
The warhead was stolen in eastern lowa.
We don't know how it's being transported.

13:26.440 --> 13:30.040
- Are we monitoring air traffic?
- " Nothing's been picked up.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.840
" On the ground,
how far could they have gone?

13:32.920 --> 13:36.920
A 300-mile radius, which includes
three metropolitan areas.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
- Have those cities been alerted?
- The president wants that restricted.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.160
We've raised alert levels,
but haven't mentioned specifics.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.120
Marwan and his people
have control of the warhead.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.360
We have to figure out
when and where he's gonna set it off.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.240
Look at everything
from satellite to local police.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.680
We have a small window.
It's still the middle of the night.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.720
A trail is going to be a hell of a lot easier
to follow now, than in two hours

14:00.800 --> 14:04.760
when people start going to work.
Let's get to it.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.160
Howard Bern.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.360
There's a program at Division
you can filter those markers through.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.400
Yeah?

14:42.480 --> 14:48.480
I've a Mr Cheng from the Chinese
consulate who wants to speak to Michelle.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.480
Michelle Dessler.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.000
My name is Cheng Zhi,
head of security for the Chinese consulate.

14:57.080 --> 15:01.640
I'm sure your office is aware of the incident
that happened here earlier tonight.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.600
Yes, we were sorry to hear about it.
Is there anything we can do to help?

15:05.680 --> 15:08.600
I would like to come
and discuss this matter with you.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.800
Of course. My office would be glad
to make an appointment in the morning.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.880
No, I need to do that right now.

15:14.960 --> 15:19.600
I'm afraid that's impossible. You must know
we're in the middle of a security crisis...

15:19.680 --> 15:23.480
The murder of our consul on Chinese soil
could be construed as an act of war.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.480
- What's that have to do with us?
- "I believe your agency stormed the consulate"

15:27.560 --> 15:29.560
and kidnapped Lee Jong.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.440
That is an outrageous accusation.

15:34.520 --> 15:39.440
An hour earlier, your government called and
asked for permission to speak to Lee Jong.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.360
30 minutes later, we were attacked. It is
unlikely these two events are unrelated.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.760
- I'm sorry, Mr Cheng, I can't help you.
- I suggest you cooperate voluntarily,

15:48.840 --> 15:51.880
otherwise I'll be forced
to go above you on this.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.400
I'm sure you'll do what you have to.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.480
I mean no disrespect,
but I do have to get back to work.

15:57.560 --> 16:02.160
Very well, Ms Dessler.
You will be hearing from me soon.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.960
Comm confirmed we got the data. Thank you.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.920
You're welcome.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.160
Yeah.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.560
- You should get some rest.
- With everything going on, I can't.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.600
- You could go back to the hotel.
- Don't tell me what to do.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.680
I'm sorry.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.320
What?

16:44.320 --> 16:47.000
Jack, what do you want from me?

16:47.080 --> 16:52.640
You made a choice that killed Paul
and I'm trying to deal with it.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.360
We both have a job.
Let's just do it.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.840
Jack. Michelle says the head of security
at the Chinese consulate just called.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.359
He made it sound like he has evidence
linking CTU to the abduction.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.319
- What kind of evidence?
- He didn't say, he wants to come talk to us.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.160
They don't have any evidence.
We don't have time to deal with them now.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.560
I agree, but we don't have much choice.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.960
I need you to help me figure out
how to deal with this, Jack.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.440
- I need to check on Lee. I'll get back to you.
- All right.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.480
CTU just sent this over.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.640
These five groups have all made attempts
to sabotage Chinese targets

17:37.720 --> 17:39.760
around the globe in the last two years.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.200
- This group.
- People's Freedom Coalition?

17:42.280 --> 17:46.880
They've referenced Lee Jong's involvement
with the Chinese nuclear programme.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.920
So an attack and the grab of Lee Jong
by this group would be plausible.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.400
It would allow the Chinese to save face.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.720
If the Chinese can't prove we entered
the consulate, that may be all they need.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.400
If you want, I can start leaking it to the media.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
Do it.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
Mr President.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.200
- David, what have you done?
- Excuse me?

18:09.280 --> 18:14.000
I just got a call from the Secretary of State
about a covert action against the Chinese.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.000
That's correct. I sanctioned it.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.880
- Why would you do such a thing?
- It was the only option.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.720
You know how fragile
our relationship with China is?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.920
An attack on their consulate.
A military engagement.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.040
A covert operation, similar to those carried
out on a routine basis around the world.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.480
Don't give me a social studies lesson.
We marched on Chinese soil,

18:33.560 --> 18:38.000
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.680
- We were unlucky, sir.
- Unlucky?

18:41.760 --> 18:45.520
I'd say we were unlucky.
That's the kind of thing that could start a war!

18:45.600 --> 18:49.240
How do I fight terrorists
while provoking a nuclear superpower?

18:49.320 --> 18:53.640
I would advise you to calm down, sir,
if we're gonna get through this day.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.600
We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.840
But we're gonna be the ones to settle it.

18:59.920 --> 19:05.520
This is a dirty business, and we're gonna
have to get our hands dirty to clean it up.

19:05.600 --> 19:10.480
Now, please, Mr President,
you brought me here to help you.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.560
Let me do it.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.080
- Tony, what's the latest on Lee?
- He's out of surgery.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.680
He'll be able to respond to questions soon.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.000
When that happens,
I want everyone from comm on standby.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.560
Whatever information Lee gives us
I want worked up with no time lags.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.960
- " We're clear about this?"
- Yes, sir.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.360
Good.

19:53.840 --> 19:58.120
Secretary of State Taylorjust authorised
the head of security at the consulate

19:58.200 --> 20:02.400
- to come here and question us about the raid.
- What? In the middle of all this?

20:02.480 --> 20:05.000
All right, this breaks down very simply.

20:05.080 --> 20:09.960
They want to prove we attacked the consulate
tonight. We have to make sure they can't.

20:10.040 --> 20:14.280
- That ambush has to land on someone.
- Novick's working on that from Washington.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.040
We just have to make sure
all our bases are covered.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.240
Finding that nuclear warhead
is our number one priority.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
I'll go over the strategy with Jack.

20:22.400 --> 20:27.120
When Cheng gets here, send him to the
situation room, all visible screens masked.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.200
OK.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.000
This situation with the consulate
is dragging us down.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.680
We shouldn't divert resources
from the warhead.

20:40.760 --> 20:45.640
Well, hopefully this will just be a formality,
and we can get rid of him quickly.

20:48.920 --> 20:53.800
If we don't get information from Lee, Audrey's
husband will have died for no reason.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.760
What is she still doing here?

20:56.840 --> 21:01.880
I think she wants to stay busy
so she doesn't have to think about it.

21:01.960 --> 21:05.120
It's funny.
When I met Audrey this afternoon,

21:05.200 --> 21:09.480
it seemed like she and Jack
were totally together.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.000
A few hours later, everything's changed.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.520
Michelle.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.520
I hate being without you.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.440
I never wanted it to be this way.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.440
Mr Cheng's here.

21:46.160 --> 21:49.760
Send him to the situation room.
Buchanan and Jack are waiting there.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.240
- Shouldn't we keep him more isolated?
- "No."

21:53.320 --> 21:57.800
We have to give the impression
we have nothing to hide.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.760
- Mr Cheng? I'm Curtis Manning.
- Hello, Mr Manning.

22:05.840 --> 22:12.560
Our regional director is waiting for us
in the situation room. If you'll follow me?

22:18.400 --> 22:22.200
Mr Cheng. Bill Buchanan.
Pleasure to meet you in person.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.640
- My condolences for your consul.
- Thank you.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.560
Jack Bauer from the DOD.
He's working for us today.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.720
Mr Cheng, please, take a seat.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.960
I know of Mr Bauer, of course,
from his previous service to this country.

22:34.040 --> 22:37.120
We knew you were in Los Angeles today.
When did you arrive?

22:37.200 --> 22:40.040
Flew in a couple days ago,
with Secretary Heller.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.720
I assume, then, Secretary Heller is still here?

22:42.800 --> 22:45.440
For security reasons he's at our district office.

22:45.520 --> 22:50.440
- Why aren't you with him?
- We felt I could be more helpful here at CTU.

22:50.520 --> 22:55.920
- That's odd.
- Not really. I used to run this office.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.920
If there's anyone capable of leading a covert
operation at short notice, you'd be ideal.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.480
- Mr Cheng, this kind of...
- It's all right, Bill, I've got it.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.520
Mr Cheng, I can assure you
that neither CTU nor I

23:09.600 --> 23:15.600
had anything to do with the terrible events
that took place at your consulate tonight.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.840
I assume you know this man.
Howard Bern, one of your field agents.

23:20.920 --> 23:26.000
This was taken by one of
our surveillance cameras tonight.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.200
- This photograph has been altered.
- To make it clearer.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.840
Or to set up a scenario
you can utilise for political propaganda.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.520
No. We ran this image through our database.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.640
The computer picked Mr Bern
as a near-perfect match.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.840
Did your database include members
of the People's Freedom Coalition?

23:44.920 --> 23:48.200
According to our information,
they're most likely behind this.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.280
That would be pointless.
This man is not Asian.

23:51.360 --> 23:56.160
Mr Cheng, we both know that the PFC has
initiated terrorist activity around the globe,

23:56.240 --> 23:58.840
utilising European mercenaries,
half a dozen of which

23:58.920 --> 24:01.840
are a closer match
to this photo than Agent Bern.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.360
I take it Mr Bern is not available to question?

24:04.440 --> 24:06.640
- No, he's not here tonight.
- Of course.

24:06.720 --> 24:11.360
You know it would not be in America's best
interests to provoke the Chinese government.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.560
Then what are we playing these games for?

24:13.640 --> 24:17.400
30 minutes before we were attacked,
you asked us to give up Lee Jong.

24:17.480 --> 24:22.080
Before our government can comply, the
consul was attacked, Lee Jong disappeared.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.640
Now you tell me you do not have Lee Jong,
Howard Bern is not available.

24:26.720 --> 24:30.040
- What are you hiding?
- " Nothing. We're just extremely busy.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.680
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.840
This is Bauer.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.960
We are faced with unprecedented...

24:36.040 --> 24:38.480
" Are we positive?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.960
OK.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.040
Thank you. We have confirmation
on Marwan's last location.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.360
Follow up on that. I'll handle
the rest of Mr Cheng's questions.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.960
I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr Bauer.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.920
I'll see what I can do.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.000
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Jack.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.880
Have Bern meet me in the east corridor.
Get a chopper ready now.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.040
" Meet Jack in the east corridor now.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.360
- " Flight ops."
- O'Brian.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.080
Jack Bauer's requesting
a helicopter standing by.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.240
- "OK. Done."
- Thank you.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.600
- Follow me.
- What's going on?

25:25.680 --> 25:28.240
Camera at the consulate picked up your face.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.880
- I was wearing my mask.
- Trust me, I saw the freeze-frame. It was you.

25:31.960 --> 25:37.480
Jack, the guy ripped the mask from my face,
I pulled it right back down. I had no idea.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.240
Leave the city.
We're working out a scenario.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.280
You're gonna have to answer
questions for the Chinese.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.880
I didn't think anyone saw me,
so I didn't bring it up.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.680
- Don't worry, we'll handle it.
- I'm sorry, Jack.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.840
You gotta go.
There's a chopper waiting for you.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.520
This is Bauer.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.640
Lee Jong's coming out of anaesthesia.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.720
He should be ready for questioning.
Agent Raab's there.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.800
I'm on my way.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.320
- You ready?
- All my databases are active.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.480
Doctor, that's enough.
He's mine now. Thank you.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.920
Tell him he's in critical condition.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.640
I'll ask questions. When he answers,
I'll let the doctor treat him.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.280
- He understands.
- I know he worked on the warhead.

26:33.360 --> 26:37.840
Now he needs to tell us where it is.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.440
He doesn't know,
but he knows where Marwan might be.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.880
Might be? In the van he told me
he knew where he was.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.320
- Marwan's been moving around.
- Where?

27:17.520 --> 27:20.880
- He has three locations Marwan's using.
- What are they?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.760
- The Rockland building.
- We know.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.840
- A bar downtown.
- We know that too.

27:24.920 --> 27:28.040
- A factory on Sixth.
- Where on Sixth?

27:34.520 --> 27:37.120
- Sixth and Alameda.
- Get me an exact address.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.320
That's the one we're looking for.

27:39.400 --> 27:45.360
Assemble a team, make sure Curtis is on it.
They need to be ready to move now.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.760
- Audrey.
- Yes?

28:04.840 --> 28:07.920
The investigator from the Chinese
wants to talk to you.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.160
Why does he want to talk to me?

28:10.240 --> 28:13.640
To protect Jack's cover,
we put together some new hourlies.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.600
They show you and Jack
working together at the time of the ambush.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.200
- Buchanan wants me to lie to protect Jack?
- Not to protect Jack.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.920
To protect the United States government.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.880
Is that gonna be a problem?

28:30.200 --> 28:32.280
Where are the hourlies?

28:32.360 --> 28:35.360
Edgar's sending them to your system.

28:36.360 --> 28:40.360
- I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.
- I understand.

28:40.440 --> 28:45.840
But whatever you decide,
you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng.

29:16.280 --> 29:20.200
- What's happening?
- Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.560
- I'm being called in for questioning.
- By who?

29:22.640 --> 29:25.200
Cheng, from the Chinese consulate.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.200
Come here. Why you?

29:27.280 --> 29:31.760
Buchanan modified the hourlies so it looked
like you were with me during the abduction.

29:31.840 --> 29:36.080
Whatever Buchanan laid out, stick to it.
We need to sideline Cheng now.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.120
Why? Lee's incriminated himself,
the Chinese won't try to protect him.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.480
That's not what this is. The Chinese
consul was killed during Lee's extraction.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.200
- The government cannot be held responsible.
- What are you doing?

29:48.280 --> 29:52.240
You have broken every major protocol
set by CTU and the DOD for what?

29:52.320 --> 29:55.480
Is any of this working?

29:55.560 --> 29:59.680
You're still alive.
Your father's still alive.

29:59.760 --> 30:04.720
And we stopped all but one of the power
plants from melting down. Yeah, it's working.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.440
And we have to fight to keep it working.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.200
Do what you have to, Audrey.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.240
I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.240
Thank you.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.520
Hello.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.040
- I got Jack's approach on Marwan's location.
- Good.

30:27.120 --> 30:31.000
Upload it to the teams, send a copy to Tony.
He's running point on this end.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.080
" You got it.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.840
I am surprised that after you were kidnapped,
that you stayed on to work here.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.480
- That must have been very difficult.
- I wasn't physically hurt.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.520
I want to help find the people
who planned these attacks.

30:45.600 --> 30:50.920
Very admirable. Now, I looked through
the hourlies for Mr Bauer, your associate.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.880
I notice from 1am to 3am, you and he
were working on some data processing tasks.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.320
Yes, that's correct.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.600
Who did you give the information to?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.920
Edgar Stiles.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.680
Why does that matter?

31:05.760 --> 31:10.760
They go to all this trouble to reenlist
a man who used to run this place, Jack Bauer,

31:10.840 --> 31:14.840
- and he's doing data processing?
- It's much more subtle than it sounds.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.400
There are hundreds of lists
to cross-reference,

31:17.480 --> 31:21.000
and with Mr Bauer's experience,
we were able to narrow the search.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.400
I am surprised.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.400
Why's that?

31:25.480 --> 31:29.680
Meaning no disrespect, the log shows
that your husband, Paul Raines,

31:29.760 --> 31:32.160
was at the clinic during those same hours.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.680
And unfortunately he passed away.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.520
What's your point?

31:40.440 --> 31:43.440
I don't believe you were
with Jack Bauer, mining data.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.360
You were waiting
for your husband in surgery,

31:46.440 --> 31:49.080
and you're lying to me now
to cover for Mr Bauer.

31:49.160 --> 31:53.440
Mr Cheng, I'm not going to allow you
to stand there and accuse my people of lying.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.840
And I'm not going to stand here
to endure half-baked alibis.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.920
You can believe whatever you want.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.360
My answers stand. Now, if we are done,
I do have to get back to work.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.440
If you'll excuse me.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.000
- Manning.
- " President Palmer for Jack."

32:15.080 --> 32:16.640
It's the White House.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.000
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, this is David Palmer.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.280
- Mr President.
- CTU tells me you got something from Lee.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.400
We got a location on Habib Marwan.

32:24.480 --> 32:28.080
We're en route with tactical teams.
We're hopeful we can end this soon.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.240
I hope you're right.
This warhead can detonate any moment.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.320
We know, sir.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.080
Jack.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.880
Tell me about the representative from the
Chinese consulate, Cheng. Is he still at CTU?

32:38.960 --> 32:41.680
- He was there when we left.
- Are we OK there?

32:41.760 --> 32:44.760
They have a surveillance photo
of one of my team members.

32:44.840 --> 32:49.880
We told them the photo wasn't clear enough
to be conclusive. That'll hold them for a while.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.360
I see. Thank you, Jack.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.680
- Thank you, Mr President.
- "And good luck."

32:55.760 --> 32:57.760
Thank you, sir.

33:00.120 --> 33:04.160
All right, Mike. I'm gonna need you
to advise the president

33:04.240 --> 33:06.280
that Cheng has to leave CTU now.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.120
Logan was clear
that he wanted Cheng to have access.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.560
And he has.
But now Cheng is slowing them down.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.840
He's got to go.
CTU needs to be able to do their job

33:15.920 --> 33:18.720
without the added pressure of a cover-up.

33:18.800 --> 33:23.400
You think you can get
President Logan to sign off on that?

33:23.480 --> 33:25.280
I'll see what I can do.

33:28.520 --> 33:32.720
Yes. No, not now, Keith, I have
too many things to deal with first.

33:32.800 --> 33:36.800
Yes, you do that. Thank you.
What is it, Mike?

33:36.880 --> 33:42.080
The Chinese security officer, Cheng, is still at
CTU, and seems to be slowing things down.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.480
He wouldn't be there if Palmer
hadn't attacked his consulate.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.040
- It's too late to change that now, sir.
- Yes.

33:49.120 --> 33:55.200
Yes, it is. If we order Cheng to leave CTU now,
it'll look like we've got something to hide,

33:55.280 --> 34:02.640
and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the
justification they need to escalate this crisis.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.880
If we don't find that warhead
before it's deployed,

34:05.960 --> 34:08.560
ten million Americans
could face annihilation.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.120
We could be at war with a billion Chinese.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.600
My advice is to worry about
the Americans now and the Chinese later.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.080
Your advice? Or David Palmer's advice?

34:17.159 --> 34:18.600
Both of ours.

34:18.679 --> 34:22.760
When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in,
it wasn't so you could ally against me.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.840
- That's not what's happening.
- Tell me what's happening.

34:25.920 --> 34:30.000
You and David Palmer are running
this country while I'm taking phone calls.

34:30.080 --> 34:34.080
Would you like me to ask
President Palmer to leave?

34:37.800 --> 34:39.800
No.

34:41.520 --> 34:46.920
Call CTU. Tell Bill Buchanan
to escort Mr Cheng out of the building.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.400
Yes, Mr President.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.040
Curtis. Put Michaels in play now.

35:22.120 --> 35:27.560
We're outside the factory, our men are in
position. Can you confirm Marwan's inside?

35:27.640 --> 35:30.480
I can't say, but I'm detecting
a microwave uplink.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.520
- Can you intercept it?
- No, it's got encryption.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.800
OK, thanks.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.120
- We ready?
- Yeah. How do we confirm Marwan's inside?

35:40.200 --> 35:43.680
We don't. But we're out of time.
We move now. Give all teams a go.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.360
All right.
All teams, it's a go.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.400
Mr Buchanan, this matter will be pursued.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.960
I will return with a formal order
for an extensive investigation.

35:58.040 --> 36:02.480
I understand. If I were you I'd focus my
attention on the People's Freedom Coalition.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.040
I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.560
- We'll do everything we can to help you.
- Sir.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.080
Excuse me.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.840
- Jack's team's outside the building.
- I'll be right there.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.200
Mr Cheng, excuse me, please.
I have to get back.

36:18.280 --> 36:22.560
- My men will escort you from the building.
- Thank you.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.240
- " Edgar?
- Thank you.

36:27.320 --> 36:30.800
Excuse me. Edgar Stiles?
Communication analyst, right?

36:30.880 --> 36:32.200
Yeah, I'm busy.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.600
I forgot to ask Mr Buchanan one thing.
Maybe you could help.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.040
- You should ask him.
- It's not classified.

36:38.120 --> 36:42.880
Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you
were helping her earlier with some DOD files.

36:42.960 --> 36:47.320
- Yeah, until she was called to the clinic.
- So it was just you and Jack then?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.000
- What?
- Edgar, come here.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.840
- I have to go. Bye.
- Thank you.

36:54.080 --> 36:58.760
- Idiot. Just keep your mouth shut.
- I didn't say anything.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.000
- Michaels, are you in position?
- "Roger that."

37:16.080 --> 37:19.240
- He's at your two o'clock. Take him out.
- "Copy that."

37:30.840 --> 37:33.720
- " We're ready."
- Start the sequence.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
We're done here.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.840
Get the car.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.280
He's cornered.
Counterflank and push him back to me.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.040
" Copy.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.040
" Freeze!

38:58.800 --> 39:01.200
I've been waiting for this.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.800
You're too late.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.120
That hurts, doesn't it?

39:25.600 --> 39:26.880
" Jack.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.400
Jack, what are you doing?
We still need him.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.720
Go ahead. Kill me.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.880
That won't stop the missile.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.400
What are you talking about?

39:48.560 --> 39:51.200
What are you talking about?

40:00.960 --> 40:03.480
Jack, we got a problem.

40:03.560 --> 40:07.240
- Better take a look at this.
- Secure the prisoner.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.680
Oh, my God, they've got a missile.

40:13.760 --> 40:17.840
Have you got your comm unit?
Patch it through. Tony, can you hear me?

40:17.920 --> 40:20.680
- Yeah?
- I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead.

40:20.760 --> 40:23.560
- It's on a missile.
- Missile? How can that be?

40:23.640 --> 40:27.480
I don't know. We're trying to get
the feed over to you now. Hold on.

40:27.560 --> 40:31.960
" Once he does, lock it on.
All right, we got it. Coming up on the screen.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.120
- Have you got it?
- Yeah.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.520
How much time have we got?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.320
51 seconds.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.440
- Tony, can you see this?
- Yeah.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.080
Can you get the source of the transmission?

40:43.160 --> 40:45.800
Hang on a second.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.640
No, it's on an encrypted uplink.
No way to trace it.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.600
Do a geography scan,
see if you can pull a location.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.880
Chloe, anything specific on the visual?

40:55.960 --> 40:58.960
" Looks like a forest area.
Trees, a structure...

40:59.040 --> 41:01.560
- Tony, we're out of time.
- " We're trying.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.200
We can't ID the location, it's too general.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.800
Edgar, see if you can
pick up a heat signature.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.160
" I'll try, but it's a wide radius.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.920
" There won't be time to stop this.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.520
" Chloe, do you have anything?

41:14.600 --> 41:19.920
" I'm trying the four-band satellite,
but it's not working either.
