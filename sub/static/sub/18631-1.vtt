WEBVTT

01:42.063 --> 01:45.624
All right, all right. Get back now.
Get back. Get over there.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.708
All right, hold on, you little animals.
I'm coming now.

01:57.811 --> 02:00.109
It's cold out there, ain't it?

02:00.714 --> 02:03.342
All right, come on.
Get through those doors.

02:03.450 --> 02:08.150
Oh, come on. Move it. Move it.
Come on, get off it. Hey!

02:35.015 --> 02:39.543
Danny, check this out, man.
Piece of cake.

02:45.858 --> 02:46.825
- ...either one of these schools...
- Sit down.

02:46.926 --> 02:48.206
You can go to...
- Mr. Rubell!

02:50.496 --> 02:51.793
- What happened?
- We've got another one.

02:51.898 --> 02:53.024
Stab wound.

02:53.633 --> 02:56.898
- Who stabbed you?
- I don't know.

02:57.003 --> 02:58.904
Of course.
Call an ambulance.

02:59.006 --> 03:00.473
I don't want no ambulance.

03:00.574 --> 03:03.542
It's not for you,
it's for the insurance company.

03:03.643 --> 03:05.577
Send an ambulance
to JFK, please.

03:05.678 --> 03:07.771
Oh, would you call
the nurse, please.

03:11.184 --> 03:14.483
- Mr. Rubell. - Just a moment.
I'll be right with you.

03:16.723 --> 03:18.714
Oh, Ms. Hammond,
what can I do for you today?

03:18.825 --> 03:21.692
- Do you know that kid
is bleeding? - Yes, I do.

03:23.563 --> 03:27.999
- Well. This is for you, Mr. Rubell.
- What's that?

03:28.100 --> 03:31.695
It's a notice informing you we'll
be holding depositions here.

03:31.803 --> 03:34.499
If your teachers can't remember
to bring their records with them,

03:34.606 --> 03:35.868
we'll come to the records.

03:35.974 --> 03:39.068
- We want to start tomorrow.
- Fine.

03:39.644 --> 03:41.908
Is that student bleeding?

03:42.013 --> 03:45.744
- Yes. We're taking care of it.
- Good. Good.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.286
Oh, Principal Horn,
this is Lisa Hammond

03:49.388 --> 03:52.016
of Kemel, Keating and Hess,
attorneys at law.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.218
How do you do?

03:54.326 --> 03:56.556
Her firm is handling
the Calvin case.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.424
- What?
- John Calvin. Suing the school.

04:04.136 --> 04:05.398
Oh, yes.

04:06.405 --> 04:08.566
Well, Ms. Hammond,
I think you'll find that we're

04:08.673 --> 04:11.574
trying to cooperate fully
with you in this matter.

04:11.676 --> 04:13.666
Mr. Horn, our client
is suing the school

04:13.778 --> 04:16.611
because he graduated
but he can't read or write.

04:16.714 --> 04:21.242
I should think all of us would be
cooperating to help clear this up.

04:25.389 --> 04:26.549
Mr. Rubell?

04:27.625 --> 04:28.990
- Mr. Rubell!
- Yes.

04:29.093 --> 04:33.086
We have at least 10% of our
teachers absent again today,

04:33.197 --> 04:36.063
and we're having
trouble finding subs.

04:36.166 --> 04:38.327
Scrape the bottom of the barrel
if you have to, Grace, please.

04:38.435 --> 04:42.167
- Mr. Rubell, I'm going to need...
- Is Jurel in yet?

04:42.273 --> 04:43.365
On a Monday?

05:12.535 --> 05:13.524
Hello?

05:13.903 --> 05:18.340
Mr. Jurel, Mrs. Wensel from Kennedy.
Are we coming in today?

05:18.441 --> 05:21.568
Or are we taking another of our
famous three-day weekends?

05:21.977 --> 05:22.944
No.

05:24.279 --> 05:25.246
What time is it?

05:25.347 --> 05:29.682
<i>It is 7:45, We are already
10 minutes late, Mr, Jurel,</i>

05:31.454 --> 05:32.421
Well?

05:33.890 --> 05:34.982
Well, what?

05:35.492 --> 05:36.925
Are you going to teach today?

05:40.096 --> 05:41.961
Yeah, I'll be in very soon.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.532
<i>Oh, why, thank you, Mr, Jurel,</i>

05:43.633 --> 05:46.260
<i>It's so nice of you to
take into consideration</i>

05:46.368 --> 05:49.030
<i>the trouble you cause
other people by your...</i>

05:52.274 --> 05:54.936
I thought you said you
were an airline pilot?

05:55.911 --> 05:57.469
I am.

05:58.780 --> 06:01.340
Didn't I just hear that lady say
something about teaching?

06:01.450 --> 06:04.385
Yeah, well, I gotta go teach
a class on cabin pressure.

06:04.486 --> 06:05.612
Oh.

06:05.721 --> 06:09.019
You know, oxygen masks.
Things like that.

06:12.026 --> 06:13.357
Do you want some coffee?

06:13.461 --> 06:16.225
- Sure. You want some help?
- No. No.

06:20.502 --> 06:21.969
Coffee's brown, right?

06:24.239 --> 06:26.366
How do you like it?
Black or burned?

06:28.810 --> 06:32.575
Look, I'm really running late here.
Maybe I'd better skip the coffee.

06:34.048 --> 06:36.016
Yeah, that'd be my move.

06:37.151 --> 06:38.118
Yeah.

06:41.589 --> 06:45.286
- Call me sometime.
- Yeah. Sure.

06:57.270 --> 06:58.669
Mr. Rubell, I have a list
of the teachers

06:58.772 --> 07:00.763
- that I would like to meet with tomorrow.
- Must have the time down.

07:00.874 --> 07:03.604
- It's important that we start... - Lee,
would you do this for me, pal, please.

07:03.710 --> 07:06.076
None of you seems to take
this lawsuit very seriously.

07:06.179 --> 07:09.012
And you, Ms. Hammond,
take things too seriously.

07:09.115 --> 07:11.311
That was your problem when
you were a student here.

07:11.419 --> 07:16.447
- And it's your problem now.
- And you were a rotten English teacher.

07:16.557 --> 07:17.887
I know.

07:25.665 --> 07:28.691
Do you know that kid's bleeding?
You should report that.

07:28.802 --> 07:32.568
- Well? - Well, not to me.
I'm here to give a lecture.

07:32.672 --> 07:35.505
How thrilling.
Auditorium across the hall.

07:39.613 --> 07:43.343
You are always hogging
that machine.

07:43.449 --> 07:44.848
Of course.

07:44.950 --> 07:48.818
Every day. Day in and day out
you are on that machine.

07:48.921 --> 07:51.355
I have been trying to use
that machine for three weeks,

07:51.457 --> 07:54.051
and every time I try,
you're here.

07:54.159 --> 07:57.890
Well, today is my day.

07:57.997 --> 08:00.693
I want to use that machine.
I need that machine.

08:00.799 --> 08:03.290
That machine needs me.

08:03.402 --> 08:06.371
- I fail to see any reason for your...
- Oh, you fail to see?

08:06.472 --> 08:08.599
You fail to see?

08:08.707 --> 08:13.167
Can you see this?
You son of a bitch!

08:14.546 --> 08:18.243
- Oh, my God.
- Today is my day! My day!

08:18.350 --> 08:19.374
- Ms. Bloom, in control.
- My day.

08:19.485 --> 08:21.805
- You control yourself. This is a school.
- My day. My day.

08:21.887 --> 08:22.876
Grace, hold up.

08:22.988 --> 08:24.785
- Ms. Bloom! Ms. Bloom!
- My day! My day!

08:24.890 --> 08:28.518
Please control yourself.
This is a school. Ms. Bloom!

08:28.626 --> 08:31.561
- Ms. Bloom, please, control yourself.
- Put her on the floor.

08:31.663 --> 08:34.222
Ms. Bloom, stop it.

08:34.332 --> 08:36.799
- Nurse!
- Come on, now. Nurse, help, help.

08:40.538 --> 08:42.267
Ms. Bloom, calm down.

08:42.373 --> 08:43.806
Who is that?

08:44.909 --> 08:46.706
School psychologist.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.775
Must apologize for the heat.

08:53.885 --> 08:56.683
This hallway is the warmest part
of the whole building.

08:56.788 --> 08:58.881
Most of the tenants just
leave their doors open,

08:58.990 --> 09:00.753
so you can get the heat.

09:00.858 --> 09:03.952
We're a real friendly building here,
you know.

09:05.163 --> 09:10.066
Are you sure he's safe? I mean,
he isn't dangerous or anything, is he?

09:10.168 --> 09:13.762
No. I assure you, there will be
no problems with Mr. Gower.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.804
He's completely harmless.

09:15.906 --> 09:18.636
He merely has a few problems
with reality, that's all.

09:19.843 --> 09:22.676
Oh, this place would be just
marvelous for Herbert.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.407
It's only four blocks
from the hospital.

09:25.515 --> 09:27.881
Yeah, well,
the apartment's upstairs.

09:34.224 --> 09:38.387
- Yes?
- Hello, Mr. Stuart Van Ark?

09:40.196 --> 09:41.629
Yes.

09:41.731 --> 09:45.896
Mr. Van Ark, this is Mrs. Wensel
from Kennedy High.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.836
<i>We want you to come in and substitute
one of our history classes,</i>

09:49.940 --> 09:53.603
<i>It may be for several days,
Can you make it?</i>

09:54.778 --> 09:56.006
Yes.

09:57.380 --> 10:01.338
She poured ink, ink,
all over Ditto.

10:01.450 --> 10:04.908
Oh, God, I'd have given anything
to have been there to see that.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.011
Can you just imagine his face?

10:08.224 --> 10:10.749
I tell you, Alex, it's never dull
around here on Mondays.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.555
- Oh, you ought to...
- Excuse me?

10:12.661 --> 10:15.425
Could you tell me where
I might find room 127?

10:15.531 --> 10:20.025
Yup. Just go back, go down the steps, turn
right and it's right around the corner.

10:20.136 --> 10:22.000
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

10:23.905 --> 10:26.066
Well, back to the trenches.

10:26.841 --> 10:28.240
My God, it's a stampede.

10:28.343 --> 10:31.039
Where are you going?
I thought you didn't like school!

10:32.046 --> 10:33.036
Move it!
Now!

10:38.921 --> 10:41.202
Hey, Timmy, if you're not running
for President, sit down.

10:41.257 --> 10:42.224
All right, will you?

10:48.329 --> 10:51.025
All right.
If you're not here, speak up.

10:53.835 --> 10:57.236
All right, boys and girls!
Ladies and gentlemen.

10:57.338 --> 11:00.034
Today we're gonna delve

11:01.009 --> 11:04.137
into the fascinating world
of radiator repair.

11:05.213 --> 11:11.048
Oh, we're supposed to be learning
about social studies, not radiators.

11:11.151 --> 11:14.177
Learning is limitless, Tim.

11:35.909 --> 11:38.434
Hold it down, please.

11:39.012 --> 11:40.570
Hold it down.

11:43.317 --> 11:45.080
Paller?

11:45.185 --> 11:47.483
- Paller?
- Here!

11:47.588 --> 11:50.148
Look, just raise your hand.
That's all I need.

11:53.826 --> 11:56.386
Please, can you keep it down?
Please!

11:56.495 --> 12:01.558
Frame? Please. Not those pants.
Not again. All right.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.329
Hold it down. Please, please.
Hold it down.

12:04.437 --> 12:07.895
Henson? Henson?
How are you, Henson?

12:08.007 --> 12:11.534
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

12:12.478 --> 12:15.471
- Alvado?
- Alvedo!

12:15.582 --> 12:16.549
What?

12:17.650 --> 12:20.346
Yesterday you said
it was Alvado.

12:20.453 --> 12:22.444
No, I didn't, Mr. Rosenberg.

12:22.555 --> 12:25.615
Yes, you did. And the day
before it was Alverus.

12:25.725 --> 12:27.352
No, I didn't!

12:27.460 --> 12:29.621
You're trying to get me
into trouble, man.

12:31.030 --> 12:33.555
What's so funny?
I don't find anything funny.

12:39.804 --> 12:42.432
Aren't you going to
take attendance?

12:43.341 --> 12:44.638
Attendance?

12:45.644 --> 12:47.202
Oh, yes.

12:48.446 --> 12:51.142
Sarah, I asked for a wrench,
not a screwdriver.

12:52.384 --> 12:54.852
Oh, I don't know.

12:54.953 --> 12:58.047
- Which is it?
- It's by your right hand.

12:59.057 --> 13:00.854
Your other right hand.

13:03.894 --> 13:05.157
Thank you.

13:22.814 --> 13:24.577
No calculators, Ms. Mason.

13:24.683 --> 13:27.651
A "B" becomes a "C,"
remember, with a calculator.

13:27.751 --> 13:28.843
What is this, summer camp?

13:28.953 --> 13:31.615
Please, please.
Everybody has their own paper.

13:33.691 --> 13:35.682
Come on, Danny, you forgot
to carry over...

13:39.263 --> 13:41.163
All right, everybody.
Stay put.

13:41.332 --> 13:43.630
Please!
Please let me go!

13:43.734 --> 13:46.498
Somebody, please!
Somebody!

13:49.672 --> 13:52.664
Alex!
Alex!

13:52.775 --> 13:54.471
Get him off me!

13:57.915 --> 13:59.780
Get him off me!

14:01.352 --> 14:04.617
Get him off me!
Get him off me!

14:05.789 --> 14:08.383
He's crazy. He's crazy!

14:08.692 --> 14:12.127
Dues are not being
paid here, people.

14:12.228 --> 14:16.096
Let's try and bring those
delinquent ones up to date,

14:16.199 --> 14:18.497
or we're gonna have
to take action.

14:19.202 --> 14:23.036
A union cannot be run on
just good intentions alone.

14:23.139 --> 14:26.700
We need cold hard cash.

14:28.244 --> 14:32.180
I want you to know that as your
union rep, I'm on top of this.

14:32.281 --> 14:34.272
They want us here at 7:35.

14:34.384 --> 14:37.784
We're gonna hold fir
until we get 7:38.

14:37.886 --> 14:42.016
Now, these are our three minutes
and we will get it.

14:42.124 --> 14:43.785
And if we were a private school

14:43.892 --> 14:48.125
then we wouldn't have to depend
on a bond issue for our salary.

14:48.231 --> 14:49.858
How do you spell tardiness?

14:49.966 --> 14:52.526
I - a - t - e.

14:52.635 --> 14:56.332
Now, about this
court-case thing.

14:57.640 --> 15:02.872
Well, all I know is that now they're
gonna take depositions here.

15:02.978 --> 15:07.039
So, we have to change
our strategy on that point.

15:07.149 --> 15:08.138
What strategy?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.742
Remember,
whatever they don't find out

15:13.088 --> 15:14.146
can't hurt us.

15:14.256 --> 15:16.190
- Did anybody really vote
for this guy? - I know.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.418
Alex, please,
I wanna hear this.

15:18.527 --> 15:21.154
I don't care what anybody
else says about this,

15:21.262 --> 15:24.060
we're gonna stick together
with the union.

15:31.605 --> 15:33.835
I get the feeling I
interrupted something.

15:33.941 --> 15:36.775
Just Malloy,
addressing the Reichstag.

15:37.546 --> 15:42.540
Oh, say, Alex. Remember this student
you once had about 10 or 12 years ago?

15:42.651 --> 15:46.586
- Her name is Lisa Hammond.
- Lisa Hammond?

15:46.687 --> 15:50.145
Oh, yeah. Bright kid.
Great ass.

15:50.791 --> 15:52.986
Yes.
Well, nothing's changed.

15:53.094 --> 15:55.221
Really?
She's here?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.296
Yeah.

15:56.397 --> 16:01.596
But get this, she's working for the law
firm that's handling the Calvin case.

16:01.702 --> 16:05.433
She's taking depositions here.
Starting tomorrow.

16:05.539 --> 16:08.666
In fact, she's taking your deposition
in two and a half weeks.

16:08.775 --> 16:11.300
I knew we should
have flunked her.

16:14.948 --> 16:17.075
You know what you're gonna say?

16:18.184 --> 16:20.846
You're not gonna betray old JFK,
are you?

16:20.954 --> 16:25.357
Oh, come on, for Christ's sake, Roger.
That'd be like shitting on the Peace Corps.

16:26.227 --> 16:30.220
You haven't lived till you see them
try to serve me with a subpoena.

16:31.064 --> 16:34.158
- Oh, here.
- What's this?

16:34.267 --> 16:37.327
Well, I tell you, Alex. You heard about
Ditto and Theresa Bloom, right?

16:37.437 --> 16:40.338
- Yeah, which version?
- Yeah.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.739
With our psychologist on temporary
leave and no money to replace her,

16:43.843 --> 16:46.175
I gotta have somebody to take over
the counseling chores.

16:46.279 --> 16:48.543
Me? Why me?

16:48.648 --> 16:50.411
- Because you're sensitive.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

16:50.517 --> 16:51.848
- You're compassionate.
- Bullshit, Roger.

16:51.951 --> 16:53.316
- You're caring.
- Bullshit.

16:53.419 --> 16:55.352
You've got a free period.

16:55.454 --> 16:57.820
Well, so does everybody
else in here.

16:57.923 --> 16:59.015
And the teachers in
the next period

16:59.124 --> 17:01.024
are gonna have a free period too,
for Christ's sake.

17:01.126 --> 17:04.561
And they'll be drafted too.

17:04.663 --> 17:07.131
Alex, we have a lot of misunderstood
youth in this place.

17:07.232 --> 17:10.633
Now, everybody's got to pitch in.
Starting with you.

17:10.736 --> 17:13.671
- How many kids is this?
- One.

17:13.771 --> 17:16.205
- One?
- Name's Eddie Pilikian.

17:16.308 --> 17:17.332
He and his parents are gonna be

17:17.442 --> 17:19.535
at the counseling office
in about 10 minutes.

17:19.645 --> 17:21.839
- All right.
- Now, I know you'll do well.

17:21.946 --> 17:23.972
- One kid?
- Yeah.

17:24.215 --> 17:25.204
All right.

17:27.152 --> 17:30.087
Sit. Right there.
Right there.

17:30.789 --> 17:32.882
Oh, Mr. Rubell!

17:32.991 --> 17:38.258
Superintendent Burke is in the
conference room with Principal Horn.

17:40.331 --> 17:41.320
Great.

17:41.599 --> 17:43.679
I mean, just what the hell
are you guys running here,

17:43.768 --> 17:45.565
a goddamn zoo?

17:45.670 --> 17:47.501
I'm in the middle of a
fund-raising breakfast

17:47.605 --> 17:50.403
and I'm informed that
your school psychologist

17:50.508 --> 17:53.875
has flipped out in the middle
of your goddamn office.

17:53.978 --> 17:56.503
And then I get here and I find
out there has been a stabbing.

17:56.614 --> 17:58.741
And if that's not enough,
one of your kids

17:58.849 --> 18:00.874
tries to eat one of your
goddamn teachers.

18:00.985 --> 18:03.976
Mr. Rubell, what the
hell do you call that?

18:04.087 --> 18:05.054
Monday.

18:05.822 --> 18:09.554
Look, Dr. Burke, whatever happens here,
I'm taking care of it.

18:09.660 --> 18:11.992
Are you also taking care
of the lawsuit here, too?

18:12.096 --> 18:14.690
You do know we're
being sued, don't you?

18:14.799 --> 18:17.825
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, you do? Good for you!

18:17.935 --> 18:21.564
- Dr. Burke, I don't think you really...
- I know. I know.

18:23.074 --> 18:24.268
I...

18:25.710 --> 18:28.872
I understand your problem, all right?

18:28.979 --> 18:32.471
But you sure as hell
better understand mine!

18:32.582 --> 18:36.382
I am fighting for our
survival out there.

18:36.486 --> 18:41.082
We cannot let the things that happened
here today circulate around the city.

18:41.191 --> 18:44.058
We have got to
control the publicity.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.721
Or else this community
is gonna lose faith in us

18:47.831 --> 18:50.128
and we won't get the new
bond issue passed

18:50.232 --> 18:52.996
and that means no money.

18:53.102 --> 18:56.697
No money means no school.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.574
Do I make myself clear?

19:00.677 --> 19:02.201
Absolutely.

19:03.580 --> 19:07.448
All right, I've asked Alan Lewis,
our attorney, to be here

19:07.550 --> 19:10.383
to help us on this matter.

19:10.487 --> 19:15.287
First of all, I wanna know who
is on our team,

19:15.958 --> 19:19.291
and I wanna know who is
going to rock the boat.

19:19.395 --> 19:21.260
And most importantly,

19:21.363 --> 19:25.663
we all have to agree on what's to
be said at these depositions.

19:27.836 --> 19:29.701
Well, very well.

19:30.673 --> 19:32.072
What would you like me to do?

19:32.174 --> 19:35.040
Well, I have taken the liberty

19:35.143 --> 19:39.705
of having your secretary pull the file
of the remaining teachers involved.

19:41.716 --> 19:43.911
I would like to go over them.

19:48.223 --> 19:52.683
All right. The first one
is Kenneth Stiles.

19:52.795 --> 19:57.323
No. Stiles has no problem.
School line all the way.

19:58.433 --> 20:00.594
Then of course there's Principal
Horn and myself.

20:00.702 --> 20:04.194
Yes, of course. What's that one?

20:07.408 --> 20:09.706
Alex Jurel, social studies.

20:09.811 --> 20:12.644
Yeah, Alex.
I don't see any problem there.

20:12.780 --> 20:16.147
Oh, really?
"1969, started free school.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.377
"Strong advocate of students' rights.

20:18.486 --> 20:21.249
"Reading program canceled in 1974
due to lack of funds.

20:21.355 --> 20:25.086
"Excellent leadership qualities."
This sounds like trouble to me.

20:25.192 --> 20:27.422
No. No, that was
over 10 years ago.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.588
Alex and I did all those things
when we started. Now look at me.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.865
No, Alex is all right now.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.133
Why, hell, if they hold a deposition on
a Monday, he might not even show up.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.071
Mr. and Mrs. Pilikian.
Alex Jurel.

20:49.182 --> 20:52.481
No, I'm Jeffrey Propes,
Mrs. Pilikian's attorney.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.917
Oh, really?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.955
Oh, what did he do this time?

20:57.791 --> 21:01.124
No, I'm here in regards to
Mrs. Pilikian's recent divorce.

21:01.228 --> 21:03.321
Oh, okay. I see.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.228
Eddie, would you wait outside.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.770
Mr. Jurel, Mrs. Pilikian has just
been through a very trying...

21:16.876 --> 21:19.071
Excuse me, one minute.

21:21.180 --> 21:25.048
Well, as you can see here
in regards to custody,

21:25.151 --> 21:27.142
Mrs. Pilikian enjoys full rights...

21:27.253 --> 21:29.552
Mr. Pilikian will of course
be allowed to see Eddie

21:29.656 --> 21:32.852
under certain conditions and
with Mrs. Pilikian's approval.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.860
Excuse me, one minute.
Why are you telling me this?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.793
Because we want
to make it clear

21:38.898 --> 21:41.162
that Eddie's father is not to
see him during school hours

21:41.267 --> 21:44.134
nor is he to attempt to pick
Eddie up from school.

21:44.236 --> 21:49.230
Mrs. Pilikian, I'm sorry you have problems,
but we're here to talk about Eddie.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.536
He's been kicked out
of his third class.

21:51.644 --> 21:55.044
He reads at a sixth-grade level
and he's majoring in detention.

21:55.146 --> 21:57.944
Now, don't you think that's just
a little bit more important?

21:58.049 --> 22:01.917
It's very important to Mrs. Pilikian
that we first settle this custody problem.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.421
Now, she hasn't been able to function
in full capacity since the divorce.

22:05.523 --> 22:09.186
I think we've said our piece.

22:10.829 --> 22:15.232
Mrs. Pilikian, don't you care
about your son's education?

22:15.333 --> 22:17.800
Isn't that your job, Mr. Jurel?

22:29.547 --> 22:32.812
Eddie.
Come on in here.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.053
Eddie, in.

22:39.590 --> 22:41.182
Sit down.

22:48.866 --> 22:50.857
- Read that.
- Do what?

22:50.968 --> 22:53.562
Just open it up anyplace
and just start reading.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.914
Out loud.

23:13.891 --> 23:16.018
- I don't like this magazine.
- What kind of magazine do you like?

23:16.126 --> 23:18.287
Come on, just lay off.
I don't need this.

23:18.395 --> 23:21.592
What you need, Eddie, is another
remedial reading class again.

23:21.698 --> 23:23.325
You're not fooling anybody.

23:23.433 --> 23:25.866
Hey, I passed that class.
You can't make me take it again.

23:25.968 --> 23:29.301
I read fine. So don't you worry
about it, okay? Just lay off.

23:30.773 --> 23:32.206
All right.

23:33.242 --> 23:36.541
But you just got kicked out
of your social studies class.

23:36.646 --> 23:38.773
So, I'll give you a choice,

23:38.881 --> 23:42.977
you can take my class or
you can take study hall.

23:45.321 --> 23:46.549
I'll take a study hall.

23:46.656 --> 23:51.592
Yeah, my class. Third period.
I'll see you there tomorrow.

23:52.394 --> 23:54.055
That's all.

24:01.971 --> 24:03.404
Now, don't blow on me.

24:04.607 --> 24:07.041
I can make it.
I can make it.

24:07.143 --> 24:10.271
No, I can't.
Are we here?

24:10.379 --> 24:13.108
- We're here.
- See, I told you I could make it.

24:15.116 --> 24:17.607
What do you want?
Hey!

24:19.654 --> 24:22.020
What was that?
What was that?

24:22.357 --> 24:24.052
What do you want?

24:25.493 --> 24:27.620
I'll have a Grasshopper.

24:29.030 --> 24:31.191
- No, make it a Pink Lady.
- All right.

24:31.299 --> 24:34.393
And put in it some fruit
and Tabasco sauce.

24:34.502 --> 24:37.402
And some of those
little sesame seeds.

24:37.504 --> 24:38.869
Oh and don't forget
the umbrella.

24:38.973 --> 24:41.806
Hold the umbrella,
open it up and put in the drink.

24:47.948 --> 24:50.314
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:56.324 --> 24:58.484
Too much vermouth.

25:00.494 --> 25:02.519
Too much vermouth.

25:05.065 --> 25:08.899
I sense tension here.
What's the matter, Alex?

25:10.671 --> 25:12.901
Oh, it's getting to me, Rog.

25:13.007 --> 25:15.475
It's supposed to,
that's why it costs so much.

25:15.576 --> 25:18.101
No, not the booze.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.612
The school.
The bullshit.

25:22.015 --> 25:23.277
The bullshit.

25:23.950 --> 25:25.645
Of course, the bullshit.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.715
Hey, I know.
Let's go be...

25:31.157 --> 25:33.022
Let's be cowboys.

25:33.126 --> 25:35.686
- Yeah, yeah. Cowboys!
- Yeah...

25:35.795 --> 25:37.092
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What?

25:37.196 --> 25:40.029
- I'm afraid of horses.
- You pussy.

25:40.133 --> 25:42.068
I'm afraid of them too.

25:48.408 --> 25:51.070
I'm just getting tired
of the whole damn thing.

25:51.177 --> 25:52.177
Like that Pilikian thing.

25:52.245 --> 25:54.645
You knew that lawyer was gonna be
with that mother, you knew that.

25:54.747 --> 25:57.648
Oh, come on. Is that what's
been bothering you?

25:57.750 --> 26:02.187
Pilikian? Oh, forget about Pilikian.
Pilikian is a lost cause.

26:02.288 --> 26:05.451
Oh, yeah.
It's getting too easy to forget.

26:05.558 --> 26:08.788
There's too many Pilikians
in that school.

26:08.894 --> 26:13.092
Hey, hey, we do good.
Lots of them learn.

26:13.198 --> 26:15.928
Lots of those kids learn.
They learn good.

26:17.502 --> 26:22.201
We are not the bad guys.
We do good with what we've got.

26:26.912 --> 26:29.039
- What we got sucks.
- You know it.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.686
So, what are you gonna do?

26:36.922 --> 26:38.480
Quit.

26:40.726 --> 26:42.523
Just quit.

26:42.627 --> 26:47.087
Hey, now listen to me.
You've been a teacher for 14 years.

26:47.199 --> 26:48.598
- Fifteen.
- That's what I said.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.565
- Oh. - And you're a
fucking great teacher.

26:50.669 --> 26:53.899
- Was! I was a fucking great teacher.
- No, no, no. Listen to me.

26:54.004 --> 26:57.770
Without us, there's nothing.
Nothing.

26:58.709 --> 27:02.167
We're the last stand
of civilization.

27:03.447 --> 27:06.712
If we fail, anarchy.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.278
"Anarchy."

27:09.120 --> 27:10.280
- Or worse...
- "Worse."

27:10.387 --> 27:11.684
- A baby boom.
- "A baby boom."

27:11.789 --> 27:14.758
What do you think those little monsters
would be doing if they weren't in school?

27:14.859 --> 27:15.826
I don't know.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.894
- Fucking, fucking like fucking
little rabbits. - Fucking?

27:18.995 --> 27:21.088
We've got to stop them.

27:21.197 --> 27:24.065
- You mean, I'm a contraceptive?
- Yes, and one of the best.

27:27.238 --> 27:29.570
I'm an old fucking rubber.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.671
I'm going to bed.
You wanna stay over?

27:36.781 --> 27:39.181
No, no, no. I can drive.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.513
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Absolutely.

28:24.060 --> 28:26.152
Mr. Jurel!

28:27.863 --> 28:30.798
Mr. Jurel,
I would like a word with you.

28:30.899 --> 28:34.198
Well, make it a quiet one, Gracie.
I've had a hard day.

28:34.303 --> 28:37.204
School hasn't even started yet.

28:38.907 --> 28:40.738
All right, what do you want?

28:40.843 --> 28:44.108
You cannot put Eddie Pilikian,
a lower-level student,

28:44.213 --> 28:48.774
into your third-period social-studies
class, an upper-level class.

28:48.883 --> 28:51.351
Sure, I can, Gracie.
I've got tenure.

28:51.452 --> 28:53.386
It's not school policy

28:53.487 --> 28:56.820
and if you would read the curriculum
circulars you would know that.

28:56.924 --> 29:00.655
But then you never read the
curriculum circulars, do you?

29:00.761 --> 29:06.530
Mr. Jurel, at least have the decency
to fill out the proper paperwork.

29:06.635 --> 29:08.728
- Okay.
- Thank you.

29:10.138 --> 29:12.662
Alex, you seen this yet?

29:13.307 --> 29:17.209
Looks great. I've been meaning
to get one of those myself, Carl.

29:31.492 --> 29:33.255
Mr. Jurel!

29:33.361 --> 29:34.851
Shit!

29:36.663 --> 29:38.096
Hi.

29:39.432 --> 29:41.195
Lisa Hammond.

29:55.583 --> 29:56.641
Okay.

29:59.719 --> 30:02.017
Holy shit, lady.

30:02.122 --> 30:03.180
God damn it.

30:03.290 --> 30:05.190
- Mr. Jurel.
- Lisa, are you nuts?

30:05.292 --> 30:06.919
This is the boys' bathroom.

30:07.027 --> 30:11.225
Yeah, I know. Well, I've always
wondered what one looked like.

30:11.331 --> 30:14.061
- No big deal.
- I'm taking a leak.

30:14.167 --> 30:15.600
I wanted to talk to you.

30:15.702 --> 30:17.363
Well, call me on the phone,
for Christ's sake.

30:17.470 --> 30:18.732
This is the boys' bathroom.

30:18.838 --> 30:22.068
Oh, come on, Mr. Jurel,
I have two brothers, for crying out loud.

30:22.174 --> 30:25.166
Well, I don't.
Do you mind?

30:33.552 --> 30:36.282
- Here, dry your hands.
- Thank you.

30:41.126 --> 30:42.753
Oh, fuck!

30:45.597 --> 30:47.258
Hi.

30:47.366 --> 30:50.267
That was cute, real cute.

30:51.036 --> 30:54.062
It really is good to
see you, Mr. Jurel.

30:55.507 --> 30:59.068
Considering how much you've seen,
why don't you call me Alex?

31:06.352 --> 31:10.310
God, the room seems
so different.

31:12.490 --> 31:15.516
I guess nothing's the
way you remember it.

31:20.098 --> 31:22.259
You're mad, aren't you?

31:25.603 --> 31:28.197
You really take your job seriously,
don't you?

31:28.306 --> 31:30.001
That's what you taught me.

31:31.641 --> 31:34.303
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

31:34.411 --> 31:38.473
- The Calvin case.
- I try to stay out of political things.

31:38.583 --> 31:41.279
I have a hard enough
time just teaching.

31:41.386 --> 31:43.411
"Political"?

31:43.521 --> 31:47.355
Alex, this case is about teaching.
It could mean a great deal to education.

31:48.893 --> 31:51.054
I mean, a boy goes all the way
through a school system

31:51.162 --> 31:55.996
and gets passing grades and a diploma
and still can't read or write.

31:56.099 --> 31:59.330
This boy was one of your students and
he can't even fill out a job application.

31:59.436 --> 32:01.461
Don't you think there's
something wrong with that?

32:01.571 --> 32:03.129
You were one of my students

32:03.240 --> 32:05.902
and you can fill out
a whole subpoena.

32:12.716 --> 32:15.742
You know,
I had a terrible crush on you.

32:15.852 --> 32:16.840
Who didn't?

32:19.789 --> 32:22.470
Listen, I'm really sorry about what I did.
Let me make it up to you.

32:22.491 --> 32:23.981
Let me buy you dinner.

32:24.093 --> 32:25.823
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

32:25.929 --> 32:28.830
What do you say?
Talk about old times and all that.

32:31.368 --> 32:33.165
Okay.
Where?

32:33.270 --> 32:36.398
How about my place, 7:30?

32:36.973 --> 32:40.339
- Does your bathroom
have a lock? - Two.

32:40.443 --> 32:41.603
Good.

32:42.945 --> 32:45.379
Okay.
Good.

32:49.285 --> 32:50.752
See you tonight.

32:54.023 --> 32:55.752
Love the shirt.

32:57.359 --> 32:59.122
Great ass.

33:03.932 --> 33:06.400
Hold it.
Let me see your pass.

33:08.436 --> 33:09.994
- Okay.
- Thanks.

33:22.418 --> 33:27.354
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Troy?
- Yeah, come on in.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.693
Present here are Lisa Hammond,
counsel for the plaintiff,

33:35.797 --> 33:38.357
Alan Lewis, counsel
for the defendant

33:38.466 --> 33:42.232
and Eugene Horn, principal of
John F. Kennedy High School.

33:43.972 --> 33:47.408
Have you ever given a
deposition before, Mr. Horn?

33:47.509 --> 33:48.941
No.

33:49.042 --> 33:51.562
Well, it's very simple. I'm just
going to ask you some questions

33:51.612 --> 33:55.139
and you're under oath, so I'd like for you
to answer them as fully as you can.

33:55.916 --> 33:58.544
- Okay.
- Good.

33:58.652 --> 34:02.452
Did you have a student here
at JFK named John Calvin?

34:02.556 --> 34:05.855
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

34:06.961 --> 34:11.897
Ms. Hammond, there are 2300
students here at Kennedy every year.

34:11.998 --> 34:13.830
I don't know all of them.

34:14.701 --> 34:18.694
- Wouldn't your records
show enrollment? - Yes.

34:19.706 --> 34:21.969
Okay, where are your records?

34:23.443 --> 34:25.467
I don't know.

34:29.550 --> 34:30.777
Fuck you!

34:35.154 --> 34:36.643
Fuck you!

34:36.755 --> 34:39.384
Move it! Coming through!
Move it! Move it!

34:39.492 --> 34:40.652
Move it!

34:41.661 --> 34:44.926
Look out.
What the hell is going on here?

34:46.065 --> 34:48.931
No problem. There's no problem.
He just slipped, okay? He's fine.

34:49.034 --> 34:51.333
- I'm fine. Fine.
- He's fine. No problem.

34:52.605 --> 34:54.596
- Hey, you okay? All right.
- I'm fine.

34:54.706 --> 34:56.766
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm fine.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.770
Fucking Paller.

34:59.879 --> 35:02.040
- Fucking Paller.
- Oh, excuse me.

35:02.148 --> 35:04.412
I didn't do shit to him.

35:09.689 --> 35:13.420
- Eddie, you got to get me a piece.
- A piece of what?

35:14.360 --> 35:17.124
That's very funny, Eddie.
Very funny.

35:18.164 --> 35:21.326
Next time I see that asshole I want
to have something on my side.

35:21.433 --> 35:24.561
No, forget it, okay?
You let me handle Paller, all right?

35:25.337 --> 35:26.326
Okay.

35:26.771 --> 35:29.239
- Thanks, Eddie. Thanks.
- Forget it. Forget it, will you?

35:29.341 --> 35:30.467
Okay. Thanks.

35:30.575 --> 35:32.702
Okay, I'm taking off.
You want to come?

35:32.811 --> 35:34.506
Sure, yeah.
Sure.

35:36.248 --> 35:37.340
- Hey, wait...
- Shit!

35:37.449 --> 35:39.110
What're we gonna do now?

35:42.520 --> 35:44.214
Hey, trust me.
Come here.

35:45.256 --> 35:47.417
- Come on, will you.
- Okay. All right.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.845
Can you believe this shit?

36:19.657 --> 36:25.596
If John Calvin was a student here at JFK,
would his name appear on these records?

36:27.331 --> 36:28.798
Yes, it should.

36:30.199 --> 36:33.362
Good. Now, who's in
charge of the records?

36:35.571 --> 36:36.833
I don't know.

36:42.546 --> 36:43.740
Nice touch.

36:44.982 --> 36:47.246
What touch?
I really don't know.

36:50.487 --> 36:52.045
That's the fire alarm.

36:53.823 --> 36:56.690
Move it out, quickly.
To the right! To the right!

37:26.955 --> 37:30.084
Hey! Hey, you two! Come here.
I want to talk to you. Hey!

37:32.261 --> 37:33.819
You're in big trouble.

37:55.817 --> 37:57.910
- Get in. Come on!
- No.

37:58.653 --> 37:59.642
We can't do this, Eddie.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.552
Haven't I taken care of things
since third grade?

38:21.610 --> 38:23.271
Have we got balls or what?

38:23.378 --> 38:25.403
This is fucking great.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.908
Give me five.

38:38.993 --> 38:42.895
So, that's how I passed
the bar exam.

38:46.233 --> 38:49.326
So, whatever happened to Mrs. Jurel?

38:50.336 --> 38:51.564
I wanted to be a teacher

38:51.671 --> 38:55.038
and she wanted something more
than my teacher salary could provide.

38:55.642 --> 38:58.338
Food, clothing, shelter.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.309
So there hasn't been
anybody else?

39:06.352 --> 39:07.614
No, not really.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.650
What about you?

39:10.624 --> 39:11.817
Oh, hundreds.

39:13.426 --> 39:15.018
I'm a lawyer after all.

39:18.531 --> 39:20.192
So, you haven't told
me what you think.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.892
Oh, the meal was great.

39:22.268 --> 39:23.565
No, I'm not talking
about the dinner.

39:23.670 --> 39:26.503
I know the dinner was great.
I got an "A" in home ec.

39:26.773 --> 39:29.105
- I'm talking about the case.
- What case?

39:30.510 --> 39:32.637
Oh, that's how we're
gonna play it?

39:35.247 --> 39:38.045
I'm serious. I really want
to know what you think.

39:38.550 --> 39:41.542
Why is it so important what
I think about your case?

39:42.454 --> 39:45.082
Because the other teachers
will follow what you do.

39:45.190 --> 39:47.317
You're one of the leaders
of that school.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.792
Boy, Lisa, you've been
gone a long time.

39:52.130 --> 39:53.597
Yeah, I guess I have,

39:53.699 --> 39:56.190
because JFK is nothing
like I remember it.

39:56.301 --> 39:58.894
- Maybe you have a selective memory.
- Oh, come on.

39:59.003 --> 40:01.438
In the two days that I've been
there I've seen a stabbing,

40:01.540 --> 40:05.135
a teacher attack another teacher,
a student bite a teacher,

40:05.244 --> 40:07.439
a fire alarm that looked
like Hiroshima.

40:07.546 --> 40:09.514
It's not a school anymore,
it's a loony bin.

40:09.615 --> 40:13.107
- Oh, Lord, here comes another subpoena.
- What's that supposed to mean?

40:13.218 --> 40:15.083
- What?
- That crack.

40:15.654 --> 40:18.885
What's the matter? You afraid I might
do more for education than you?

40:18.991 --> 40:20.686
Education? Are you nuts?

40:21.092 --> 40:23.686
Lisa, your lawsuit isn't
about education.

40:24.362 --> 40:25.693
It's about money.

40:27.765 --> 40:30.359
Nobody really cares if
that kid didn't learn.

40:31.903 --> 40:34.167
They just wanna make
some major bucks.

40:34.472 --> 40:35.905
Oh, great.
Just what we need.

40:36.007 --> 40:38.999
Words of wisdom from a guy
who hides out in bathrooms.

40:41.078 --> 40:44.638
You know, Lisa, there's nothing worse
than a female lawyer with a cause.

40:44.748 --> 40:46.841
Except a male teacher
without one.

40:48.084 --> 40:50.678
Is it so hard for you to admit
that something's wrong there?

40:50.788 --> 40:52.050
Oh, hell, Lisa.
Come on!

40:52.156 --> 40:54.681
Do you think you're telling
me something here?

40:55.092 --> 40:58.084
I've been there day in and
day out for 15 years.

40:58.195 --> 41:00.060
Don't even think you can try.

41:01.365 --> 41:02.332
Listen.

41:03.467 --> 41:07.402
I counseled a kid named Eddie Pilikian
the other day and it was a waste of time.

41:07.504 --> 41:09.131
I can't reach this kid.

41:10.140 --> 41:13.041
The parents and the system,
they've so fucked up this kid

41:13.143 --> 41:14.508
that I don't know.

41:15.145 --> 41:17.943
I don't think I'm ever gonna
be able to reach him.

41:19.583 --> 41:20.811
Yes, you will.

41:22.519 --> 41:24.987
You'll reach him.
You'll make a difference.

41:26.856 --> 41:28.187
You did with me.

41:33.796 --> 41:37.596
Look, it's not right for a lawyer
to be discussing a case

41:37.700 --> 41:40.396
with someone she's gonna be
deposing in two weeks, is it?

41:40.502 --> 41:44.337
No. But I didn't ask you
here as an attorney.

41:45.742 --> 41:46.902
Why did you?

41:57.019 --> 42:00.955
I think I better
check the dessert.

42:07.963 --> 42:10.989
What do you mean, what am
I gonna say at my deposition?

42:11.734 --> 42:13.497
I'm gonna say the same
as everyone else.

42:13.602 --> 42:15.536
Oh, Carl, just forget it.

42:15.638 --> 42:17.730
Easy for you to say.
You forget it!

42:19.273 --> 42:21.798
I'm telling you that Reese
kid has gotta go!

42:21.909 --> 42:23.109
He's trying to drive me crazy.

42:23.111 --> 42:25.238
First he attacks me,
now he's trying to drive me nuts.

42:25.346 --> 42:27.371
- I want him out!
- Will you calm down?

42:27.482 --> 42:30.212
Yeah, Alex,
I had Eddie Pilikian.

42:30.318 --> 42:32.310
The kid had about
a sixth-grade reading level.

42:32.421 --> 42:33.911
He couldn't do the work.

42:34.023 --> 42:36.116
I didn't know what
to do with him.

42:36.892 --> 42:39.156
How about teaching
him to read better?

42:39.460 --> 42:42.827
Mr. Van Ark,
I am a social studies teacher.

42:42.964 --> 42:45.057
It is not my job to
teach reading.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.827
But you are a teacher.

42:49.671 --> 42:52.868
Some people should have more
experience before they speak.

43:01.616 --> 43:04.448
So, what are you gonna say
at your deposition, Ray?

43:05.152 --> 43:07.279
What is this?
An inquisition?

43:07.387 --> 43:08.513
- Carl, be reasonable.
- "Reasonable"?

43:08.622 --> 43:10.021
Now, what do you want
me to do with him?

43:10.123 --> 43:11.681
- I told you!
- I cannot expel him!

43:11.792 --> 43:12.759
Why not?

43:12.859 --> 43:15.327
Because the courts will not allow us
to violate that poor child's rights.

43:15.429 --> 43:16.453
What about my rights?

43:16.563 --> 43:18.758
And a juvenile hall will just
send him right back here.

43:18.865 --> 43:21.857
Nobody would want us to let
that kid loose on society.

43:22.135 --> 43:23.831
Then put him in his class.

43:25.605 --> 43:27.163
Oh, it's fine with me.

43:27.841 --> 43:30.776
- I'll handle him.
- You'd bore him to death.

43:31.912 --> 43:33.777
What's that supposed to mean?

43:35.949 --> 43:37.883
What do you think
it means, Ditto?

43:37.984 --> 43:41.078
Your class is boring.
Your students don't learn a thing.

43:41.421 --> 43:44.618
If it weren't for tenure,
you'd be selling vacuum cleaners.

43:44.858 --> 43:46.291
Have I left anything out?

43:46.860 --> 43:48.986
I don't have to take
that from you.

43:49.829 --> 43:54.698
I have received three consecutive teaching
awards for the most orderly class.

43:59.371 --> 44:02.397
Three consecutive
teaching awards

44:02.508 --> 44:05.136
for the most orderly class.

44:05.244 --> 44:07.678
And what do you think
about that, mister?

44:08.914 --> 44:10.973
Gee, Ditto,
your shit don't stink.

44:19.959 --> 44:23.156
And how was your date last night
with Ms. Hammond, Alex?

45:19.317 --> 45:21.682
Reese, where the
hell is my desk?

45:23.253 --> 45:26.222
Reese,
where the hell is my desk?

45:26.323 --> 45:27.449
Reese!

45:36.400 --> 45:37.458
All right.

45:38.535 --> 45:42.301
Let's talk about the responsibility
a school has to its community.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.768
Aren't we going over
our homework questions?

45:44.874 --> 45:47.638
We'll do that later.
Let's talk about this first.

45:48.044 --> 45:51.207
Does a school have a responsibility
to its community?

45:51.314 --> 45:52.440
Babysitter.

45:52.982 --> 45:54.951
All right, babysitter.
That's right. Yeah.

45:55.052 --> 45:56.280
Anything else?

45:58.488 --> 46:00.581
You were supposed to
be here yesterday.

46:00.691 --> 46:03.728
Mrs. Wensel says I ain't even
supposed to be in this class.

46:03.994 --> 46:05.256
Yo, me neither.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.654
No one knows where you're
supposed to be at, Terry.

46:10.666 --> 46:13.499
It's all right. I'll take care of it.
Take a seat.

46:16.239 --> 46:21.370
So, what other responsibilities
does a school have to its community?

46:28.918 --> 46:30.578
Where did you leave off?

46:32.087 --> 46:33.418
Pickett's Charge.

47:51.799 --> 47:54.962
"Four score and
seven years ago,

47:56.537 --> 47:59.904
"our fathers brought forth
on this continent

48:00.941 --> 48:02.272
"a new nation,

48:03.576 --> 48:05.567
"conceived in liberty

48:06.846 --> 48:09.337
"and dedicated to
the proposition

48:10.450 --> 48:13.886
"that all men are created equal."

48:28.801 --> 48:31.065
All right, all right.
Forget community.

48:31.170 --> 48:32.865
Let's just talk about you.

48:33.639 --> 48:35.072
Let's talk about us.

48:35.742 --> 48:37.869
You in school,
what does school do for you?

48:37.977 --> 48:39.342
- Nothing!
- Nothing?

48:40.246 --> 48:42.714
It gives you a diploma
so you can get a job.

48:42.949 --> 48:44.314
Then it does something.

48:44.417 --> 48:46.885
School is just a place where
teachers make money.

48:46.986 --> 48:48.010
Yeah, sure.

48:48.121 --> 48:51.146
I got a yacht in the Caribbean.
All right?

48:51.256 --> 48:52.450
Lot of money.

48:52.691 --> 48:56.422
- Does school round out
your knowledge? - No.

48:57.729 --> 48:58.696
Why?

48:58.797 --> 49:01.732
They teach you all this junk
like who was Hiawatha.

49:02.701 --> 49:04.498
I don't care who she was.

49:05.003 --> 49:07.801
They never teach you what
you want to know, right?

49:08.240 --> 49:09.935
Hiawatha was a man, Tim.

49:11.609 --> 49:13.577
You see what I mean?
Who cares?

49:13.711 --> 49:16.591
I think we know what's better for us
more than the teachers do, you know.

49:16.648 --> 49:17.637
- Right.
- Right.

49:17.749 --> 49:18.875
Tell them about it, Diane.

49:18.984 --> 49:20.952
I think school does a good job.

49:21.186 --> 49:22.278
Oh, shit.

49:22.788 --> 49:25.279
It makes us better people
if we learn this.

49:29.761 --> 49:33.219
Mr. Pilikian, was that
just a large breakfast?

49:33.665 --> 49:35.564
Or do you disagree
with this man?

49:41.439 --> 49:42.406
Well?

49:42.873 --> 49:44.898
Come on.
This place is a joke.

49:45.009 --> 49:46.738
What do you mean, it's a joke?

49:46.844 --> 49:50.473
You're being sued by some kid
'cause you didn't teach him nothing.

49:52.683 --> 49:55.516
What're you gonna say when
they ask you about that?

49:59.422 --> 50:00.753
All right. Fine.

50:04.194 --> 50:07.187
Mr. Pilikian has just given us
another assignment.

50:07.331 --> 50:08.320
Say what?

50:08.966 --> 50:10.092
Oh, man!

50:10.201 --> 50:11.293
No, wait a minute.

50:11.402 --> 50:15.361
You tell me. Tell me what's
wrong with this school.

50:16.407 --> 50:18.307
You tell me what I should say.

50:19.243 --> 50:21.233
So, what? We gotta write
another paper now?

50:21.344 --> 50:23.608
No, you don't gotta
write another paper.

50:23.713 --> 50:26.807
Just communicate your ideas.
I don't care how you do it.

50:27.584 --> 50:30.544
You can write a paper if want or take
a photograph. Do it any way you want.

50:30.620 --> 50:31.746
Sing a song.

50:32.322 --> 50:33.448
Communicate.

50:33.756 --> 50:34.723
Hold it.

50:35.492 --> 50:38.859
How do we know if we do this
we're not gonna get in trouble?

50:38.995 --> 50:40.053
You don't.

50:40.964 --> 50:42.329
But I'll guarantee it.

50:43.433 --> 50:45.263
No getting us for what we say?

50:45.367 --> 50:46.527
No reprisals.

50:47.503 --> 50:48.936
Yeah, no reprisals.

50:50.305 --> 50:51.363
All right.

51:43.824 --> 51:45.724
All right.
One more, one more.

51:46.260 --> 51:47.489
All right, you ready?

51:49.064 --> 51:51.532
Okay. Great going.
Okay. And...

52:06.047 --> 52:08.038
Boring!
Boring.

52:22.195 --> 52:23.423
Teacher's lounge.

52:24.664 --> 52:26.359
That's the girls' bathroom.

52:34.507 --> 52:36.771
Eddie.
Eddie.

52:37.677 --> 52:39.577
- All right.
- Eddie.

52:41.281 --> 52:42.908
- Eddie.
- All right.

52:43.049 --> 52:44.243
Way to go, Eddie.

52:44.718 --> 52:46.686
No reprisals, right?

52:52.792 --> 52:54.350
- Mrs. Wensel?
- Yes.

52:54.461 --> 52:56.486
Dan Hall, Independent
Insurance Company.

52:56.596 --> 52:59.087
I'm here about the accident
involving the driver's ed car.

52:59.199 --> 53:00.962
- Sounds good.
- Oh.

53:01.234 --> 53:03.167
We seem to have misplaced it.

53:04.336 --> 53:05.360
What?

53:05.704 --> 53:09.299
How can you misplace a one-ton
piece of equipment?

53:09.942 --> 53:11.910
Are you kidding?
At this place?

53:18.217 --> 53:19.275
What's up?

53:21.487 --> 53:22.454
This.

53:27.058 --> 53:29.186
- Not too bad.
- Not too bad?

53:29.762 --> 53:32.060
The kid rips off a camera
and takes these pictures

53:32.164 --> 53:34.428
and all you can say is,
"Not too bad."

53:35.734 --> 53:38.567
The morning paper is
running these tomorrow.

53:39.805 --> 53:41.773
I've been on the phone
with Dr. Burke all morning.

53:41.874 --> 53:44.240
- Do you want to know
how mad she is? - No.

53:45.944 --> 53:47.741
He claims you okayed this.

53:49.013 --> 53:49.980
Did you?

54:03.061 --> 54:04.028
Yes.

54:06.230 --> 54:07.322
You can go.

54:07.799 --> 54:09.664
Where the hell are your brains?

54:09.767 --> 54:11.928
You know how much embarrassment
this is gonna cause us?

54:11.935 --> 54:13.368
Oh, come on, Roger.

54:14.504 --> 54:17.735
It's not like that kid was chewing
bubble gum or something.

54:17.908 --> 54:20.935
Look, this is the first time
I've gotten to this kid.

54:21.546 --> 54:24.208
Maybe I can make him
give a shit about himself.

54:24.716 --> 54:27.617
That's a hell of a lot more important
than a silly thing like this!

54:27.719 --> 54:29.186
That's not your job!

54:29.554 --> 54:32.045
So don't pull some of that
Mr. Chips crap with me!

54:32.357 --> 54:35.237
Your job is to get them through this
school and keep them out of trouble.

54:35.258 --> 54:36.316
That's it!

54:38.362 --> 54:40.421
Well, maybe I should
reexamine my job.

54:40.530 --> 54:41.861
Maybe you should!

54:45.869 --> 54:47.666
I don't know what's
happening to you, Alex.

54:47.771 --> 54:51.263
But if you got a personal problem,
you work it out at home, not here.

54:53.710 --> 54:55.837
This goes on your
permanent record.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.947
Does that mean I have to
stay after school, too?

55:08.591 --> 55:11.060
Did you forget to tell
me about the paper?

55:12.429 --> 55:13.794
Okay, Pilikian.

55:13.897 --> 55:17.230
You miss my class one more time
I'll let them have your butt.

55:18.301 --> 55:19.268
Deal?

55:21.103 --> 55:22.297
It's a deal.

55:32.581 --> 55:35.448
So, this is your idea
of a gourmet dinner, eh?

55:35.551 --> 55:38.816
Well, you haven't lived until
you taste one of my tacos.

55:39.355 --> 55:41.715
One taste and you're gonna agree,
I should've taught home ec

55:41.791 --> 55:43.691
instead of Mrs. Badie.
Move your buns.

55:45.260 --> 55:47.023
Wasn't Mrs. Badie...

55:47.128 --> 55:48.095
Cut.

55:49.030 --> 55:51.555
Wasn't Mrs. Badie having
an affair with Ditto?

55:52.600 --> 55:54.261
Why, does that turn you on?

55:54.636 --> 55:56.069
Compared to what?

56:04.413 --> 56:05.380
To this.

56:34.408 --> 56:36.467
Sure beats the
hell out of Ditto.

56:40.280 --> 56:44.216
I had my...
My little talk with Ditto today.

56:45.285 --> 56:46.582
Guy's still a jerk.

56:46.687 --> 56:48.888
Why? Did he fall asleep while
you were asking questions?

56:48.956 --> 56:51.255
We both fell asleep
during his answers.

56:51.359 --> 56:53.087
It's really ticking me off.

56:54.061 --> 56:57.292
I mean, I just don't understand.
I...

56:58.832 --> 57:00.823
- Are you listening to me?
- No.

57:00.934 --> 57:01.901
Cut.

57:03.237 --> 57:05.535
I mean, I can understand Horn
and Rubell ducking my questions,

57:05.639 --> 57:07.664
but I'm trying to
help the teachers

57:07.774 --> 57:11.005
and all I'm getting is a lot of
"I don't knows" and "I can't remember."

57:11.111 --> 57:13.272
Wish I knew what
the hell was going on.

57:13.380 --> 57:16.678
Lisa, are you gonna talk about this
all night, because I'm getting turned on.

57:16.782 --> 57:19.546
You just don't understand
the frustration, Alex.

57:19.652 --> 57:20.880
You wanna bet?

57:22.455 --> 57:24.423
You don't get out much, do you?

57:25.024 --> 57:30.519
Lisa, can't you for one night just forget
about the case, the school and everything?

57:31.731 --> 57:32.959
For one night?

57:35.835 --> 57:37.325
All right.
I'm sorry.

57:38.037 --> 57:39.594
You're right.
We'll...

57:40.572 --> 57:46.307
We'll just have a nice dinner and
relax and I won't say another word.

57:46.412 --> 57:47.572
Great.

57:50.316 --> 57:52.580
It's just, I can't understand
the teachers.

57:52.685 --> 57:55.085
I mean, I'm trying to change
an inept system

57:55.187 --> 57:56.984
and that can only help them.

57:58.391 --> 58:00.120
Lisa, who do you think
makes up this system?

58:00.226 --> 58:01.454
The people do.

58:01.961 --> 58:03.689
And they don't wanna be
scapegoats for that system.

58:03.795 --> 58:06.127
- I'm not on a witch hunt.
- Yes, you are.

58:07.899 --> 58:09.799
What is that supposed to mean?

58:10.502 --> 58:12.800
Everybody wants to change it.

58:12.904 --> 58:15.702
They all have ideas, but nobody
wants to pay the price.

58:15.807 --> 58:18.048
Now, you're asking some teachers
to stick their necks out

58:18.143 --> 58:20.509
and they know they're
gonna get chopped.

58:20.812 --> 58:23.576
You'll end up closing the school,
not changing it.

58:24.716 --> 58:27.149
You're not gonna tell
the truth, are you?

58:28.052 --> 58:29.747
It won't change anything.

58:38.330 --> 58:39.422
Oh, Lisa, look.

58:39.531 --> 58:42.523
I remember a lot from your class,
Mr. Jurel.

58:43.535 --> 58:45.730
About how you were supposed to
fight for what you believed in

58:45.837 --> 58:47.236
no matter what it cost.

58:47.339 --> 58:48.771
Was that all a lie?

58:48.973 --> 58:51.567
Were you just having fun
with a bunch of kids?

58:52.776 --> 58:54.368
What about Eddie Pilikian?

58:54.478 --> 58:57.345
Doesn't he mean anything
or was that just self pity?

58:58.482 --> 59:00.950
I needed you, Alex.
I was counting on you.

59:01.151 --> 59:02.846
And what about you, Lisa?

59:04.054 --> 59:06.522
I haven't seen you
since I don't know when.

59:07.758 --> 59:09.885
All of a sudden we're going
out and having dinner.

59:09.994 --> 59:11.756
Is that part of this fight?

59:12.128 --> 59:15.325
- Is that what you think?
- What're you getting out of this?

59:16.399 --> 59:17.957
Your name in the paper?

59:18.067 --> 59:21.298
Just by being here I am
eopardizing my career,

59:21.404 --> 59:23.999
but I couldn't stay away.

59:26.644 --> 59:28.737
And now I can't even
remember why.

59:31.382 --> 59:32.644
I don't know how to
make you believe me.

59:32.750 --> 59:35.070
I don't know if I even really care,
but I'll tell you this.

59:35.084 --> 59:36.278
I'm gonna ask the questions

59:36.386 --> 59:38.650
and you're gonna have to
give me the answers.

59:38.755 --> 59:40.985
I know what's going
on in that school

59:41.357 --> 59:43.348
and I'm gonna change it
with or without you.

59:43.459 --> 59:45.051
What the hell do you know, Lisa?

59:45.161 --> 59:47.220
You're not a teacher,
you're a lawyer.

59:47.330 --> 59:49.662
You can't see what's
going on in there.

59:49.932 --> 59:53.026
You and those others, you come in the
school and you waltz down those hallways

59:53.136 --> 59:54.967
and you think you can tell us
what's happening there?

59:55.071 --> 59:56.629
Well, that's bullshit!

59:57.440 --> 59:58.701
You can't see what's
happening there

59:58.807 --> 01:00:01.901
because you're hiding behind
your memories and your ideals.

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:04.001
You use them like shields.

01:00:06.148 --> 01:00:07.348
When you can drop your shields

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:10.715
and walk down those halls naked
and really see what's happening

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:13.050
then talk to me and
I'll believe you.

01:00:19.529 --> 01:00:20.496
Bye.

01:00:31.273 --> 01:00:32.240
Hey!

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:34.433
Not bad.

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:36.306
Where did you get this car?

01:00:36.845 --> 01:00:40.406
What do you think?
A little paint, a little glue.

01:00:40.515 --> 01:00:42.278
Where did you get this car?

01:00:43.884 --> 01:00:46.250
- Where did you get it?
- It's Rosenberg's.

01:00:47.455 --> 01:00:49.252
What, are you fucking crazy?

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:51.858
What...
What's your problem?

01:00:51.959 --> 01:00:54.399
You, you stupid asshole,
you don't go ripping a teacher's car.

01:00:54.462 --> 01:00:55.827
What, you want to go
back to juvie again?

01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:57.761
- Get the hell off of me!
- No, you can't do this.

01:00:57.865 --> 01:00:59.162
You're gonna get caught.
Now, just take it back.

01:00:59.266 --> 01:01:01.029
No way. I took this. It's mine.

01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:03.070
No, no. Take it back.
Get rid of it, all right?

01:01:03.171 --> 01:01:04.729
- Oh, I see. I see.
- Get rid of it.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.798
Only the great Pilikian can steal a car,
anybody else does it, they're stupid.

01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:11.241
- I'm not stupid!
- No, no, Danny, you don't understand.

01:01:11.345 --> 01:01:13.404
Rosenberg is gonna have
the cops all over the place.

01:01:13.514 --> 01:01:14.674
Just take it back, all right?

01:01:14.715 --> 01:01:18.811
No! Fuck you! You're so worried about it,
you fucking take it back.

01:01:18.919 --> 01:01:20.011
Fuck you!

01:01:22.857 --> 01:01:24.119
Oh, shit!

01:02:41.532 --> 01:02:44.502
- Why do we have to read this book?
- Because I said to.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:48.433
It's a good book. I just reread
it myself last summer.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.132
You read in the summer?

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.994
What is the name of this river?

01:03:12.096 --> 01:03:13.290
Potomac!

01:03:13.431 --> 01:03:14.455
The Delaware!

01:03:14.565 --> 01:03:17.261
Delaware!
The Delaware!

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:22.098
Row!
Row!

01:03:22.907 --> 01:03:24.169
Row!

01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:47.327
What we're talking about here, literally,
is the future of the school.

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:52.157
They're gonna try to prove that John
Calvin was knowingly promoted

01:03:52.669 --> 01:03:54.864
when in fact he
should've failed.

01:03:56.206 --> 01:03:57.298
Now as two of his teachers

01:03:57.407 --> 01:04:00.399
you're going to be asked
questions pertaining to that.

01:04:01.044 --> 01:04:03.512
Mr. Rosenberg,
your deposition is tomorrow.

01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:07.874
Mr. Jurel, yours is in four days.

01:04:07.984 --> 01:04:09.952
Carl, give it a rest, will you?

01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:15.757
Now, I feel confident

01:04:15.858 --> 01:04:19.521
that we have effectively stalled
their access to the school records.

01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:21.933
However...

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:27.069
it would be most beneficial if neither
of you had any personal records.

01:04:29.205 --> 01:04:31.298
Don't you wanna
know if it's true?

01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:33.164
Beg your pardon?

01:04:33.276 --> 01:04:35.971
I said, "Don't you wanna
know if it's true?"

01:04:36.912 --> 01:04:39.039
Isn't that the best
place to start?

01:04:40.382 --> 01:04:41.747
Not necessarily.

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:43.943
Alex, just stick to the discussion,
please.

01:04:44.053 --> 01:04:45.577
- Well, I am.
- No, no, no.

01:04:45.688 --> 01:04:49.124
I don't think the question here
is whether or not we're guilty.

01:04:49.658 --> 01:04:52.491
No.
Innocence is irrelevant.

01:04:52.594 --> 01:04:54.289
Oh, you mean we're guilty?

01:04:54.396 --> 01:04:57.297
Let's not say that, okay?
Even if you're kidding.

01:04:57.399 --> 01:04:59.457
Let's just agree
not to say that.

01:04:59.901 --> 01:05:03.234
Oh, I see. I see.
Guilt isn't irrelevant.

01:05:03.338 --> 01:05:04.965
I asked you not to say that.

01:05:05.073 --> 01:05:06.404
Look, Mr. Jurel,

01:05:07.342 --> 01:05:11.176
all we're trying to do here is to help
you better prepare your answers.

01:05:11.879 --> 01:05:15.178
We're not conducting some
great search for the truth.

01:05:15.484 --> 01:05:16.644
Oh.

01:05:17.052 --> 01:05:20.782
Yes, now, let's stick to the discussion.
Carl, quit pacing, will you?

01:05:20.922 --> 01:05:22.913
I'll pace if I want to, damn it!

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:26.957
God!
This place is unbelievable.

01:05:28.896 --> 01:05:31.797
- I want my car back!
- What is he talking about?

01:05:31.899 --> 01:05:34.367
Now, calm down.
Just calm down, Carl.

01:05:34.469 --> 01:05:37.700
Calm down? Calm down?
That's what you said when I got bit.

01:05:37.805 --> 01:05:39.565
That's what you said
when they stole my desk.

01:05:39.574 --> 01:05:42.941
I got a big flash for you, Roger.
It didn't work then and it won't work now.

01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:44.135
Calm, Carl.

01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:46.209
And you people are beautiful.

01:05:46.847 --> 01:05:49.111
All of you just sitting here,
telling us how to lie.

01:05:49.216 --> 01:05:51.081
- Don't say that!
- Come on, come on!

01:05:51.184 --> 01:05:52.811
That's what all of you people
are doing, aren't you?

01:05:52.919 --> 01:05:54.819
- Telling us how to lie!
- Mr. Rubell.

01:05:54.921 --> 01:05:56.855
I will not tolerate this
breakdown of teamwork.

01:05:56.957 --> 01:05:59.323
Teamwork?
Teamwork, my ass!

01:05:59.426 --> 01:06:01.451
I'll tell you what you can do
with your teamwork!

01:06:01.561 --> 01:06:03.756
- Carl... Carl.
- Mr. Rubell...

01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:07.128
- I got a lot to say. A lot to say!
- Don't say that!

01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:10.032
You will sit down and you
will do what you are told

01:06:10.137 --> 01:06:11.377
and that is all there is to it.

01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:12.963
I will not sit down!
I'm not a child!

01:06:13.073 --> 01:06:14.713
You can't talk...
I'm not in kindergarten!

01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:17.402
- Mr. Rubell!
- What?

01:06:18.412 --> 01:06:20.277
I'm sorry, Grace, what is it?

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:23.081
There is something
wrong with Mr. Stiles.

01:06:23.517 --> 01:06:24.484
Who?

01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:26.686
Ditto.

01:06:29.189 --> 01:06:30.348
Move out now!

01:06:30.456 --> 01:06:31.855
Let's go!

01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:33.720
Move out!
Let them through!

01:06:34.427 --> 01:06:36.054
- Come on, let's go.
- Let them through.

01:06:36.162 --> 01:06:37.629
Come on!
Move, move, move!

01:06:39.732 --> 01:06:42.200
- What the hell is this place?
- He's inside.

01:06:42.668 --> 01:06:44.101
Down this way.
Let him through, now.

01:06:44.203 --> 01:06:45.966
Let him through,
let him through.

01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:51.441
- This guy's dead.
- Really?

01:06:51.544 --> 01:06:53.170
How can you tell?

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:44.282
Hi, Eddie.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.952
Hey, Diane, what's up?

01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:51.262
I need some help.

01:07:55.073 --> 01:07:56.563
Do your parents know?

01:07:57.509 --> 01:08:00.273
You can't tell them,
Mr. Jurel, please.

01:08:01.813 --> 01:08:04.280
Eddie told me I could
trust you, you know.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.009
Look, Diane...

01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:11.986
- They should be told.
- No, Mr. Jurel.

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:14.648
My God, they'd kill me.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:18.890
My father would throw me out.
My whole life would be over.

01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:21.598
Please.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.395
Which teacher is the father?

01:08:24.835 --> 01:08:27.200
No, never mind.
I don't wanna know that.

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:37.736
What do you want to do?

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:42.582
Get an abortion.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.511
Well, there are other options.
You could...

01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:50.023
You could have the baby
and put it up for adoption.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.964
Will you take me, Mr. Jurel?

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:05.932
I can't.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:09.801
Please.

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:18.479
I'll take you.

01:09:23.258 --> 01:09:24.486
I'll take you.

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:04.825
Are you sure you're okay?

01:10:06.267 --> 01:10:07.529
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.800
Listen, can I bum a cigarette?

01:10:13.207 --> 01:10:15.869
- Diane, look, I don't think...
- Mr. Jurel,

01:10:15.976 --> 01:10:19.606
I just had an abortion.
I think I'm old enough to smoke.

01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:25.145
Yeah.

01:10:25.519 --> 01:10:26.918
Thanks.

01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:39.091
Diane,

01:10:42.136 --> 01:10:44.569
you gotta try to
forget about it.

01:10:46.639 --> 01:10:48.971
You know what
really gets to me?

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.077
What really gets to me is that

01:10:55.114 --> 01:10:57.639
it just doesn't bother me,
you know?

01:10:59.619 --> 01:11:01.450
It doesn't bother me.

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:04.486
Why?

01:11:31.783 --> 01:11:32.875
So?

01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:40.615
You gotta be kidding me.

01:11:40.726 --> 01:11:44.253
You know how many people
have been looking for this car?

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.266
You took it?

01:11:49.368 --> 01:11:51.302
Hey, I never said that.

01:11:51.536 --> 01:11:53.833
I'm just showing you something.

01:11:53.938 --> 01:11:56.839
- Why? - Well, I figure this
makes us even now.

01:11:57.041 --> 01:11:58.008
What?

01:11:58.109 --> 01:12:02.240
Well, you did something for me,
I'm doing something for you. We're even.

01:12:03.482 --> 01:12:05.507
That's important to you?

01:12:06.485 --> 01:12:08.612
I don't owe people nothin'.

01:12:13.592 --> 01:12:14.991
Hey, Eddie,

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.925
how about keeping the car
and taking the reading class?

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:21.122
Hey, we're even, man.

01:12:21.232 --> 01:12:24.360
Oh, come on, Eddie,
knock off the dumb-talk crap.

01:12:24.769 --> 01:12:28.830
You wanna act stupid in class,
that's fine by me, if that's your act.

01:12:28.939 --> 01:12:31.464
But we both know
you're not stupid.

01:12:31.842 --> 01:12:33.707
So give me a break.

01:12:34.578 --> 01:12:37.513
You're getting a chance here, Eddie,
take it.

01:12:37.948 --> 01:12:40.745
Sure beats the hell
out of stealing cars.

01:12:41.918 --> 01:12:43.442
Take the class.

01:12:45.822 --> 01:12:48.723
Who you doing this for, me or you,
all this?

01:12:53.097 --> 01:12:54.621
Does it matter?

01:13:00.504 --> 01:13:03.529
All right, I'll take the class.
You can keep the car.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.733
Well, what the hell am I supposed
to do with it?

01:13:05.842 --> 01:13:08.402
Just drive it up to
the principal's office?

01:13:08.511 --> 01:13:11.207
You're a teacher, man,
you'll think of something.

01:13:11.314 --> 01:13:12.440
Smart.

01:13:23.059 --> 01:13:24.617
You okay, Carl?

01:13:24.761 --> 01:13:26.728
Fine, fine,
don't worry about me.

01:13:26.829 --> 01:13:29.992
Okay, Mr. Rosenberg,
you just follow my lead today.

01:13:30.098 --> 01:13:31.725
- I think everything will be...
- I know. I know. I know.

01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:35.133
You've gone over it a million times.
I know it by heart.

01:13:35.237 --> 01:13:38.206
I'll be okay. Don't worry about it.
I'll do the right thing. I will.

01:13:38.307 --> 01:13:40.970
- Okay, good man.
- Okay. Let's do it.

01:13:48.617 --> 01:13:51.017
Was John Calvin a
student of yours?

01:13:51.119 --> 01:13:52.643
Absolutely.

01:13:53.355 --> 01:13:57.018
Did John Calvin pass the
required course in your class?

01:13:57.659 --> 01:14:01.493
I don't think Mr. Rosenberg could
answer that question as put.

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:03.825
It's rather vague.

01:14:06.134 --> 01:14:10.036
Okay, did John Calvin receive
a passing grade in your class?

01:14:11.839 --> 01:14:12.897
Yes.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.136
Did he deserve it?

01:14:15.676 --> 01:14:17.716
I don't think Mr. Rosenberg
can answer that question

01:14:17.812 --> 01:14:21.043
until he fully understands
what the question means.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.079
Did John Calvin complete
the work required

01:14:26.187 --> 01:14:29.850
to enable him to receive a
passing grade in your class?

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:32.916
- Once again...
- Oh, shut the hell up!

01:14:33.028 --> 01:14:34.858
Just shut the hell up!

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:38.360
John Calvin didn't deserve
any grade in my class,

01:14:38.466 --> 01:14:41.196
because he rarely, if ever,
bothered to show up.

01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:43.770
I had nothing to
base my grade on.

01:14:43.905 --> 01:14:45.964
Then why did you pass him?

01:14:47.575 --> 01:14:49.600
Because it's policy.

01:14:58.485 --> 01:15:00.385
I'm sure we can clear
this whole thing up.

01:15:00.487 --> 01:15:01.920
- It's like he's retarded.
- Yes, I know.

01:15:02.022 --> 01:15:04.923
I demand to know why
you are flunking my son.

01:15:05.058 --> 01:15:06.047
What?

01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:08.753
How can you flunk him when
he's already passed the class?

01:15:08.862 --> 01:15:11.888
Wait a minute, Mrs. Pilikian,
now, I'm not flunking your son.

01:15:11.998 --> 01:15:15.229
The problem here is your getting Eddie
to take over the reading class

01:15:15.335 --> 01:15:16.597
that he's already taken.

01:15:16.703 --> 01:15:18.000
He's already passed.

01:15:18.104 --> 01:15:19.594
- Who's Jurel?
- I am.

01:15:19.706 --> 01:15:22.334
He's not supposed to be here. You know that.
I told you I can handle this.

01:15:22.442 --> 01:15:23.670
- He's my son, too.
- Wait a minute.

01:15:23.777 --> 01:15:25.244
- What's going on here?
- Are you trying to flunk my boy?

01:15:25.345 --> 01:15:27.870
Mr. Rubell said that he doesn't have
to take the reading class again.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.449
Well, wait a minute, if he doesn't have
to take the course again, why...

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:33.110
You're not supposed to be here.
He is not supposed to be here.

01:15:33.219 --> 01:15:34.880
- He needs that class.
- I asked you a question, Jurel.

01:15:34.988 --> 01:15:37.218
Alex, he's already
passed the class.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.125
- Look, I've got a...
- Will you just shut up.

01:15:39.225 --> 01:15:41.989
Hey, why don't you all just
shut up for a minute, all right?

01:15:44.797 --> 01:15:47.061
You don't talk to me like that.

01:15:48.734 --> 01:15:49.962
Fuck off.

01:15:52.171 --> 01:15:54.503
- Come on, come on, come on.
- He's my kid, Jurel, I'll handle him.

01:15:54.607 --> 01:15:56.074
You're doing a hell
of a job, pal.

01:15:56.175 --> 01:15:57.938
If you screw around with
my kid again, I'll be back.

01:15:58.043 --> 01:16:00.910
That's not gonna solve anything.
Now, please.

01:16:01.013 --> 01:16:02.241
Let go.

01:16:03.449 --> 01:16:05.314
Mr. Pilikian, please.

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:06.611
Please.

01:16:18.631 --> 01:16:19.893
What are we gonna do?

01:16:19.999 --> 01:16:21.933
You heard him. Drop it.

01:16:22.034 --> 01:16:24.696
- He can't read.
- He can read enough.

01:16:24.803 --> 01:16:27.135
Enough? What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:29.673
God damn it, Alex, what the hell
do you want me to do?

01:16:29.774 --> 01:16:33.039
I am not wasting what little time
and money I've got on one kid.

01:16:33.144 --> 01:16:36.875
For every Eddie Pilikian, there are 50,
100 kids who learn here and learn well.

01:16:36.981 --> 01:16:38.812
Now, we're not here to
worry about one kid.

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:42.477
We're here to get as many of these kids
through the system with what we've got.

01:16:42.587 --> 01:16:45.181
Now, that's reality,
and you know it.

01:16:45.456 --> 01:16:48.220
- You can't see it, Roger, can you?
- See what?

01:16:48.326 --> 01:16:50.294
This is the same thing
we're being sued about.

01:16:50.395 --> 01:16:52.795
Don't talk to me about being sued, Alex.
I don't wanna hear that.

01:16:52.896 --> 01:16:55.797
This is the reason Lisa Hammond's
down the hall taking depositions.

01:16:55.899 --> 01:16:58.333
- We're not teaching these kids.
- I can't hear you, Alex.

01:16:58.435 --> 01:16:59.959
- We're not teaching these kids.
- I can't hear you.

01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:02.938
- We're doing it again!
- I can't hear you!

01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:19.621
- One second.
- Violators...

01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:22.243
All these names, numbers don't match up.
They're not even close.

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:23.624
But I wasn't the
only one there.

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:25.957
Superintendent Burke, please.

01:17:26.063 --> 01:17:27.621
Anything wrong?

01:17:28.632 --> 01:17:30.429
Rosenberg fucked us.

01:17:32.602 --> 01:17:33.864
What?

01:17:34.504 --> 01:17:36.369
He told everything.

01:17:38.408 --> 01:17:40.341
How could you let that happen?

01:17:40.443 --> 01:17:43.276
There wasn't anything I could do
about it, Roger.

01:17:43.379 --> 01:17:45.347
Oh, God damn it!

01:17:51.587 --> 01:17:53.783
You can't even
control Rosenberg?

01:17:55.926 --> 01:17:58.827
You know,
this puts it in your boy's lap.

01:17:59.229 --> 01:18:02.061
If Jurel confirms this
in his deposition,

01:18:02.498 --> 01:18:03.897
we're sunk.

01:18:04.667 --> 01:18:07.135
Donna, hold on.

01:18:19.482 --> 01:18:21.313
Donna, this is Roger.

01:18:22.218 --> 01:18:24.152
We've gotta dump Jurel.

01:18:33.895 --> 01:18:35.863
Hey, Mr. Jurel,

01:18:37.832 --> 01:18:39.925
aren't we gonna do nothin'?

01:18:46.408 --> 01:18:48.568
How could you be so stupid?

01:18:48.676 --> 01:18:52.203
Would you tell me how you
could be so goddamn stupid?

01:18:57.719 --> 01:18:59.653
As if we don't have
enough problems.

01:19:01.022 --> 01:19:03.820
We're in the middle
of a lawsuit, buddy.

01:19:05.994 --> 01:19:08.019
- Three girls.
- Oh, hey.

01:19:08.129 --> 01:19:10.154
Three of our own students.

01:19:10.331 --> 01:19:14.460
Why don't you go to some other school
and get their girls pregnant?

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:19.200
Do you know what this is
gonna do to this school?

01:19:19.306 --> 01:19:21.706
Do you know how
it's gonna look?

01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:25.542
Teamwork, Troy,
does not mean going out

01:19:25.646 --> 01:19:27.204
and starting your own team.

01:19:28.882 --> 01:19:30.406
- What?
- Mr. Rubell?

01:19:30.517 --> 01:19:31.643
What?

01:19:32.586 --> 01:19:33.553
What is this?

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:37.589
It's a search warrant for lockers
50 through 400, inclusive.

01:19:37.825 --> 01:19:39.588
Oh, no, you gotta be
kidding me. When?

01:19:39.693 --> 01:19:41.092
Right now.

01:19:51.305 --> 01:19:53.739
Did you know your
cop is flunking?

01:20:00.446 --> 01:20:03.415
I'm trying to talk to them,
but they won't take it seriously.

01:20:04.617 --> 01:20:06.881
That's why it's very important

01:20:07.653 --> 01:20:09.348
that everyone be
at that meeting.

01:20:09.455 --> 01:20:11.082
Oh, my God.

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.352
- Something wrong?
- What?

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:16.758
No, no, no, nothing's wrong.

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:22.700
There's cops out there
searching lockers again.

01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:37.216
Get back there.

01:20:37.383 --> 01:20:38.782
Fuck you!

01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:18.649
330, whose is this?

01:21:23.561 --> 01:21:24.823
It's his.

01:21:30.234 --> 01:21:32.168
You wanna explain this?

01:21:35.205 --> 01:21:36.467
Busted!

01:21:43.948 --> 01:21:46.473
Hey, you,
get away from the locker.

01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:50.846
Get away from the locker.

01:21:51.922 --> 01:21:53.183
Hold it.

01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:55.187
Hey, you.

01:21:56.759 --> 01:21:57.987
Gun!

01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:01.658
Drop the gun.

01:22:01.764 --> 01:22:03.163
Drop the gun!

01:22:03.266 --> 01:22:04.324
No!

01:22:04.667 --> 01:22:06.033
Drop it!

01:22:34.897 --> 01:22:36.956
So, why did you
divide your force?

01:22:37.066 --> 01:22:38.533
Why? To prevent escape.

01:22:38.634 --> 01:22:41.864
That the Indians would escape
was my greatest fear.

01:22:43.438 --> 01:22:46.407
Excuse me, is your name
Herbert Gower?

01:22:47.242 --> 01:22:48.368
Yes!

01:22:49.444 --> 01:22:50.502
Okay.

01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:54.778
You mean,
you're not Stuart Van Ark?

01:22:55.183 --> 01:22:56.446
Certainly not.

01:22:56.552 --> 01:22:59.851
You're an outpatient at
Riverdale Mental Hospital?

01:23:00.089 --> 01:23:01.351
At times.

01:23:03.425 --> 01:23:05.154
Get him out of here.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.026
- Oh, no.
- Hey, you can't take him.

01:23:10.966 --> 01:23:12.058
Sit down!

01:23:19.741 --> 01:23:21.902
Don't you know who I am?

01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:24.606
Sure, you're General Custer.

01:23:24.913 --> 01:23:27.142
I am a teacher,

01:23:27.782 --> 01:23:30.478
and you will treat me as such.

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.630
Mr. Jurel.

01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.209
Mr. Van Ark.

01:24:00.247 --> 01:24:01.578
Gower.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.478
Mr. Gower.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.775
Where you been?

01:25:11.183 --> 01:25:12.445
Just around.

01:25:13.952 --> 01:25:15.180
You okay?

01:25:19.491 --> 01:25:21.481
So, you gonna come back?

01:25:23.761 --> 01:25:25.786
Not to this place. No way.

01:25:28.834 --> 01:25:31.359
Then what are you
doing here, Eddie?

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.405
I heard about Danny.

01:25:38.844 --> 01:25:41.779
Why'd they kill him?
He wouldn't have used the gun.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.404
Nobody knew that, Eddie.

01:25:43.514 --> 01:25:46.108
Yeah, well, I did.
I knew Danny, man.

01:25:46.217 --> 01:25:48.651
He was just scared.
He was always scared here.

01:25:48.753 --> 01:25:49.953
He wouldn't have used the gun.

01:25:49.954 --> 01:25:52.354
He just wanted to make sure
nobody got to him, that's all.

01:25:52.456 --> 01:25:53.480
It's not your fault.

01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:56.856
No, it is my fault,
'cause I should have been here.

01:26:03.401 --> 01:26:04.993
He was my friend.

01:26:08.071 --> 01:26:09.436
I know that.

01:26:10.974 --> 01:26:12.498
But he's dead.

01:26:15.979 --> 01:26:17.674
I'm sorry about it.

01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:20.708
But, Eddie, he's dead,
you're not.

01:26:20.818 --> 01:26:23.651
Now, you still got a chance.
You got a chance, the one he didn't have.

01:26:23.754 --> 01:26:25.813
Now, don't lose it.
There's still time.

01:26:25.923 --> 01:26:27.720
What, time for what?

01:26:29.327 --> 01:26:31.317
We both have a lot to do.

01:26:31.628 --> 01:26:33.425
I'm gonna do my part.

01:26:34.531 --> 01:26:36.431
Do yours.
Come back.

01:26:50.213 --> 01:26:51.908
You gonna stay,

01:26:52.682 --> 01:26:54.239
or you gonna go?

01:27:13.903 --> 01:27:16.370
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Sloan?

01:27:16.472 --> 01:27:18.838
Yeah, I thought you might
want to know that

01:27:18.941 --> 01:27:21.501
we've reached a
settlement with JFK.

01:27:22.177 --> 01:27:26.136
The school district has agreed
to pay the Calvins $150,000

01:27:26.248 --> 01:27:28.546
with a non-admission of guilt.

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.781
Well, what's the matter, Hammond?
You look like I just shot your dog.

01:27:34.890 --> 01:27:36.824
You can't be serious.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.020
This isn't just a routine
contract negotiation,

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:43.563
this is a school.

01:27:43.665 --> 01:27:46.395
We have the chance
to do what's right.

01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:49.932
You know the only thing that's right
is what the client wants.

01:27:50.038 --> 01:27:51.505
They want to settle, we settle.

01:27:51.606 --> 01:27:55.064
We're a business. Like anybody else,
we make a profit,

01:27:55.543 --> 01:27:57.511
hopefully more than most.

01:27:57.612 --> 01:28:01.344
So, we just check the profit and
loss column to see what's right?

01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:03.713
Don't get involved, settle the case,
collect our check

01:28:03.818 --> 01:28:06.048
because we're just a business?

01:28:06.154 --> 01:28:09.055
Well, what do we tell all those children
who have to attend that school

01:28:09.157 --> 01:28:11.489
and others like them
that aren't gonna learn?

01:28:11.592 --> 01:28:13.958
Sorry kids, maybe next time.

01:28:14.062 --> 01:28:15.689
We lose if we settle this case,

01:28:15.797 --> 01:28:19.426
because we're helping to turn out
a whole generation of illiterates.

01:28:19.534 --> 01:28:23.527
We're not talking about business here,
damn it. We're talking about the future.

01:28:23.638 --> 01:28:27.198
We're talking about reality, Hammond,
and sometimes it's a pain in the ass.

01:28:27.307 --> 01:28:30.105
Leave what's right to God
and the Supreme Court.

01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:32.735
That's what they get paid for.

01:28:36.216 --> 01:28:37.945
Good night, Hammond.

01:28:48.427 --> 01:28:50.623
No, no, no, wait a minute, now,
listen to me, really, really.

01:28:50.731 --> 01:28:53.564
This kid has beaten up everybody
in the neighborhood,

01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:55.464
and I wanted him bad.

01:29:07.147 --> 01:29:08.512
All right!

01:29:21.127 --> 01:29:25.086
So, Mr. Jurel, what's going on?
You getting married or something?

01:29:27.133 --> 01:29:28.566
Ms. Warren,

01:29:29.068 --> 01:29:32.970
one does not require a special
occasion to show a little style,

01:29:33.572 --> 01:29:36.199
a little class in one's
personal appearance.

01:29:36.307 --> 01:29:38.366
Oh, of course, excuse me.

01:29:38.877 --> 01:29:41.142
Besides, today's my deposition.

01:29:41.614 --> 01:29:44.139
Yeah, and she's good-looking.

01:29:46.752 --> 01:29:48.720
I don't know the names,
but if you do see him,

01:29:48.821 --> 01:29:51.221
have him go directly
to the gym. Okay?

01:29:51.657 --> 01:29:53.284
Mr. Rubell.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.585
- All waiting down in the gym.
- All right, good.

01:29:56.695 --> 01:29:59.663
Grace, would you find Principal
Horn and have him join us?

01:29:59.764 --> 01:30:02.130
Okay, Malloy,
you've got your deal.

01:30:02.233 --> 01:30:05.202
Now, is the union gonna
stand in our way?

01:30:06.471 --> 01:30:08.336
He's all yours.

01:30:11.743 --> 01:30:12.903
I hate making deals,

01:30:13.011 --> 01:30:15.809
but I sure as hell don't want anybody
around who could hurt us the next time.

01:30:15.914 --> 01:30:17.108
Yeah.

01:30:17.215 --> 01:30:18.375
What about the gym teacher?

01:30:18.483 --> 01:30:20.348
He's cooperating.
We're putting him in another school.

01:30:20.451 --> 01:30:23.352
- Rosenberg?
- I'm having him come in today.

01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:44.239
Mr. Jurel?

01:30:45.476 --> 01:30:48.707
Mr. Jurel, you're wanted
in the gymnasium.

01:30:49.546 --> 01:30:51.013
What for?

01:30:51.114 --> 01:30:53.014
I'm sure I don't know.

01:31:02.092 --> 01:31:03.616
Ah, Mr. Jurel,

01:31:04.161 --> 01:31:06.322
won't you join us, please?

01:31:23.947 --> 01:31:27.075
- What's going on?
- Please be seated, Mr. Jurel.

01:31:38.427 --> 01:31:39.724
Mr. Jurel,

01:31:41.297 --> 01:31:44.755
how happy are you here,
at John F. Kennedy?

01:31:50.039 --> 01:31:52.030
What is this all about?

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.038
We feel, that is,

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.745
all of the board members
present and myself,

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:01.338
that it would be best

01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:03.648
if you

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:06.652
were to tender
your resignation.

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.246
- Why?
- Because,

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:11.723
Mr. Jurel,

01:32:12.662 --> 01:32:16.119
nobody here wants to go through
the pain of firing you.

01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:29.972
You can't fire me,

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:32.707
I've got tenure.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:42.646
Hey, I just heard they're
gonna fire Jurel.

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:45.018
What?
Where'd you hear that?

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:48.490
The office. Old lady Wensel
was talking about it.

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:56.903
Mr. Jurel, you know a student
named Diane Warren?

01:32:57.304 --> 01:33:01.070
Isn't it true you took Diane Warren,
a 16-year-old student,

01:33:01.275 --> 01:33:04.005
to the free clinic to
have an abortion?

01:33:04.878 --> 01:33:08.279
The abortion was performed
without parental consent.

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:13.643
- Roger?
- I'm waiting for your answer.

01:33:15.155 --> 01:33:16.452
Roger.

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.658
Now, come on, Roger.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.422
Talk to me.

01:33:21.528 --> 01:33:25.361
Do you think that this is proper
conduct for a teacher?

01:33:29.135 --> 01:33:33.629
Well, it's a hell of a lot better conduct
than the teacher that got her pregnant.

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:36.231
And what was his name?

01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:40.037
You son of a bitch.

01:33:46.619 --> 01:33:49.644
I just figured what
this is all about.

01:33:50.055 --> 01:33:53.651
You know, this isn't about a
16-year-old girl that got pregnant.

01:33:54.861 --> 01:33:58.695
Oh, hell no, that's the last thing
that this would be about.

01:34:00.266 --> 01:34:03.497
We're afraid of what
old Alex is gonna say

01:34:03.603 --> 01:34:05.935
at his deposition today.

01:34:06.739 --> 01:34:09.674
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna say.

01:34:10.009 --> 01:34:13.171
Wouldn't you like to hear that,
Rog, old buddy?

01:34:13.412 --> 01:34:15.107
Forget it, Alex.

01:34:15.347 --> 01:34:17.815
The case has been
settled already.

01:34:18.316 --> 01:34:20.807
There's not gonn
be a deposition.

01:34:21.653 --> 01:34:23.177
It's over.

01:34:26.291 --> 01:34:29.658
Your resignation, Mr. Jurel.

01:34:30.228 --> 01:34:32.492
Oh, for Christ's sake, Burke,

01:34:32.798 --> 01:34:34.992
what do you think,
that's gonna stop me?

01:34:35.099 --> 01:34:37.624
A disgruntled former employee,

01:34:37.735 --> 01:34:41.330
who was fired, connected with
sexual misconduct.

01:34:41.806 --> 01:34:43.968
Now, who would listen to you?

01:34:46.311 --> 01:34:48.575
Who's gonna listen to you?

01:34:50.982 --> 01:34:52.779
Take the deal, Alex.

01:34:54.052 --> 01:34:55.144
- Take it.
- Roger.

01:34:55.253 --> 01:34:57.550
Sign the paper and
then go home.

01:34:57.655 --> 01:35:01.182
Tomorrow, go out and look
for another job. Do it, Alex.

01:35:02.927 --> 01:35:06.419
Or you'll never work as a teacher
for the rest of your life.

01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:08.225
I promise you that.

01:35:13.404 --> 01:35:14.962
Oh, Roger.

01:35:20.244 --> 01:35:21.574
Well.

01:35:23.747 --> 01:35:27.444
Larry. Hey, Larry.
Come on, Larry.

01:35:29.385 --> 01:35:31.512
Help me out.
Come on, Larry.

01:35:33.256 --> 01:35:36.988
I mean, is three minutes all
we got left to fight for?

01:35:41.732 --> 01:35:42.892
Larry?

01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:49.401
You son of a bitch.

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.507
Son of a bitch.

01:36:03.853 --> 01:36:05.616
I hope it's worth it.

01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:36.310
Alex.

01:36:40.689 --> 01:36:42.714
You were right all along.

01:36:43.358 --> 01:36:46.691
The case wasn't about education,
it was about money.

01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:49.062
They settled.

01:36:50.332 --> 01:36:53.494
- It's over. - Your news
bulletin's a little late.

01:36:55.736 --> 01:36:56.725
What are you doing?

01:36:56.838 --> 01:36:59.329
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm packing.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.839
I quit.

01:37:01.576 --> 01:37:04.067
- You can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

01:37:05.446 --> 01:37:06.777
Why?

01:37:08.249 --> 01:37:10.444
Some schoolteacher knocked up
a 16-year-old girl,

01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:13.019
and I took her to
get an abortion.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.112
Now, if I don't resign,
they're gonna nail my ass to the wall.

01:37:16.224 --> 01:37:19.819
They're bluffing, Alex.
They'd never risk the publicity.

01:37:21.863 --> 01:37:23.854
Didn't you hear what
I said before?

01:37:23.965 --> 01:37:26.490
The school system settled the case.
They paid them off.

01:37:26.601 --> 01:37:30.059
The school was more afraid
of publicity than of losing.

01:37:30.538 --> 01:37:32.165
Fight 'em, Alex.

01:37:32.874 --> 01:37:35.240
You still can't see it, can you?

01:37:36.811 --> 01:37:38.676
Nobody cares!

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.174
I'm out.

01:37:45.919 --> 01:37:47.750
I'm through fighting.

01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:52.315
I can't make a difference.

01:37:52.425 --> 01:37:53.824
Yes, you can!

01:38:57.022 --> 01:38:58.717
So, you gonna stay,

01:38:59.625 --> 01:39:01.252
or you gonna go?

01:39:19.344 --> 01:39:21.869
No!
No, damn it!

01:39:22.146 --> 01:39:25.274
Don't you walk away, Alex!
Don't you turn your back on this

01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:27.142
just because you're scared!

01:39:27.251 --> 01:39:29.913
So, everybody loses,
is that it, Alex?

01:39:30.088 --> 01:39:32.522
Just because you're the one
who's afraid to face reality?

01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:34.283
You're the one who's afraid
to drop your shields,

01:39:34.391 --> 01:39:38.327
because if you did you know you'd have
to take the risk of staying and fighting.

01:39:38.428 --> 01:39:41.124
You're the one who's afraid
to walk naked down the hall.

01:39:41.231 --> 01:39:42.892
Well, I'm not.

01:39:43.367 --> 01:39:45.164
You're scared, Alex.

01:39:45.702 --> 01:39:49.434
There's a whole room full of kids
in there, and they care!

01:39:49.574 --> 01:39:51.974
And there's a hell of a lot more
where they come from.

01:39:52.076 --> 01:39:54.476
They need you,
and you need them,

01:39:54.579 --> 01:39:58.776
but you just pretend it isn't real
so you have an excuse to walk away.

01:39:58.882 --> 01:40:01.407
For Christ's sake,
put your clothes on, Lisa.

01:40:01.518 --> 01:40:03.577
Well, I'm not afraid
to face reality.

01:40:03.687 --> 01:40:06.247
I'm not afraid to walk
naked down the hall.

01:40:06.356 --> 01:40:08.290
- Lisa. Lisa!
- Alex, come on.

01:40:08.392 --> 01:40:10.155
- Come on, Alex.
- Lisa!

01:40:10.427 --> 01:40:11.553
Lisa!

01:40:12.996 --> 01:40:15.328
Damn it, baby, please get dressed,
or I'm gonna call the cops.

01:40:15.432 --> 01:40:17.992
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- That's it, I'm calling the cops.

01:40:18.101 --> 01:40:20.728
Central, this is hall D calling.
Get the cops up here, right away.

01:40:46.295 --> 01:40:47.592
Lisa,

01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:51.397
you are crazy.
You are absolutely crazy.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.491
And you are a teacher.

01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:56.968
Alex Jurel, the teacher.

01:40:58.707 --> 01:41:00.937
Don't let them destroy that.

01:41:06.948 --> 01:41:08.176
Oh, God.

01:41:09.184 --> 01:41:10.776
Oh, Lisa, jeez.

01:41:20.762 --> 01:41:21.854
Come on.

01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:30.362
Are you gonna stay,
or you gonna go?

01:41:30.638 --> 01:41:32.833
Take Lisa out of here, okay?

01:41:32.941 --> 01:41:35.307
All right, I can handle that.

01:41:43.051 --> 01:41:46.282
I just think I was a little hasty, maybe.
What do you think?

01:41:46.387 --> 01:41:48.981
I don't wanna go to another school.
I love this school.

01:41:49.090 --> 01:41:52.423
Alex, look at this.
They're making me resign, Alex.

01:41:54.228 --> 01:41:56.560
What the hell are you...
He signed that.

01:41:56.663 --> 01:41:58.654
They can't make
you resign, Carl.

01:41:58.765 --> 01:42:01.734
- What?
- Nobody is resigning.

01:42:02.436 --> 01:42:03.596
No?

01:42:05.205 --> 01:42:06.672
Hey, my car!

01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:09.270
Hey, that's my car.

01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:12.572
That's my car.
What happened to my car?

01:42:13.847 --> 01:42:17.543
- I'm not gonna resign, Roger.
- You're finished. You're out.

01:42:18.185 --> 01:42:19.880
Oh, hell, Burke,

01:42:19.987 --> 01:42:21.818
I'm gonna tell you something.
I haven't even started.

01:42:21.922 --> 01:42:24.413
Now, listen,
if you try and fire me,

01:42:24.625 --> 01:42:26.525
I'm gonna be suing you.

01:42:27.594 --> 01:42:29.221
What's that gonna solve, Alex?

01:42:29.329 --> 01:42:32.560
I don't know, Roger,
but let's try it and find out.

01:42:32.799 --> 01:42:35.563
The damn school wasn't built
for us, Roger.

01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:40.071
It wasn't built for your unions, your
lawyers, and all your other institutions.

01:42:40.173 --> 01:42:42.198
It was built for the kids.

01:42:42.408 --> 01:42:44.376
They're not here for us.

01:42:44.744 --> 01:42:46.507
We're here for them.

01:42:46.712 --> 01:42:49.442
That's what it's about.
Kids.

01:42:50.316 --> 01:42:54.946
Alex, half of them aren't even
coming back after the alarm.

01:42:55.888 --> 01:42:57.378
But half will.

01:42:58.758 --> 01:43:00.783
I think they're worth it.

01:43:02.961 --> 01:43:05.794
Jurel, you're crazy,
you know that?

01:43:06.765 --> 01:43:09.234
What can I say?
I'm a teacher.

01:43:12.905 --> 01:43:14.429
I'm a teacher.

01:43:19.378 --> 01:43:21.243
All right, Jurel!

01:43:26.218 --> 01:43:28.311
You're the man, Jurel!

01:43:29.054 --> 01:43:31.852
Don't let them push you around,
Mr. Jurel.

01:43:33.625 --> 01:43:36.287
Forget to tell me about
the fire alarm?

01:43:36.576 --> 01:43:38.246
You're a teacher.
