WEBVTT

00:08.801 --> 00:10.678
Woman: How often are you having sex?

00:10.719 --> 00:12.011
Uh, excuse me?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.514
We've been off our game a little bit lately.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.556
Um, 0.5 times a week.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.266
<i>Last season on "You Me Her"...</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:18.143
Jack: We lied with disturbing specificity.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.395
Well, you got to lie. Like, I'm gonna tell

00:20.437 --> 00:21.856
the whole neighborhood we haven't had sex in two months?

00:21.897 --> 00:23.357
Well, you just did.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.942
You need to do it someone you don't know,

00:24.984 --> 00:26.443
someone who doesn't laugh when you get your sexy on.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.403
I'm talking about an escort.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.700
I came clean. Don't I get points for coming clean?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.242
You get points for admitting to scarfing down

00:34.284 --> 00:35.828
the second half of my panini,

00:35.870 --> 00:37.663
not for confessing to spending happy hour

00:37.705 --> 00:39.164
in a hotel room with a hooker.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.041
-I met Izzy today. -Surprise.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.126
-And I probably should've

00:43.168 --> 00:44.545
told you this a long, long time ago.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.338
Izzy.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.882
She wasn't my first girl.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.801
Jack: Your stupid moron plan actually worked.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.219
Emma and I are having crazy sex.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.346
What if it's all Izzy? We -- we agree that

00:54.388 --> 00:55.639
this is a business arrangement, right?

00:55.681 --> 00:56.849
Izzy: Well, you know,

00:56.891 --> 00:58.183
I had my date with Emma last night.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.810
It was pretty awesome.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.145
Like a fucking lesbian romance novel. Blegh!

01:02.187 --> 01:05.273
Whatever the fuck that is, stop it immediately.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.402
What are you doing

01:08.443 --> 01:10.362
-So, hi. -So who was that chick

01:10.404 --> 01:12.072
who got dropped off at your house two nights ago?

01:12.113 --> 01:15.200
I told her she was, uh, my niece.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.827
-Babe, just take a breath. -I need this.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.286
I want to be dean of this place.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.830
Lori's big on spite.

01:19.872 --> 01:23.291
Lori, who is now, you know, on the alumni board.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.626
Do you know that she has a boyfriend?

01:24.668 --> 01:25.836
What are you doing here?

01:25.878 --> 01:27.838
I'm looking for a girl. I knew it.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.799
Andy, why'd you follow me here, to my uncle's house?

01:30.841 --> 01:33.427
You know, I'm getting the overwhelming sense that, uh,

01:33.468 --> 01:35.220
Jack isn't really Izzy's uncle, you know.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.346
What?

01:36.388 --> 01:38.223
I fucked Andy.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.059
Give me one good reason

01:40.099 --> 01:41.936
why I shouldn't punch you in the vag right now.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.897
You find Jacqueline Isabelle's last name

01:44.939 --> 01:48.233
and any social networking site that proves her and Jack's

01:48.275 --> 01:49.735
big sister could pick each other out of a line-up,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.278
let alone share DNA.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.487
This was supposed to be easy.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.322
I'm not exactly a Photoshop wizard.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.991
It's Ava.

01:56.033 --> 01:56.951
It worked.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.577
I love us.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.496
Emma: Maybe this is doable, the road less traveled,

02:01.538 --> 02:03.415
the relationship more populated.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.499
Pfff.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.626
Why does it have to be scary?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.002
I'm actually confused.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.169
Did you say this was permanent?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.337
I know that you guys feel this

02:09.379 --> 02:10.631
just as much as I do.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.049
We have careers.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.550
We have neighbors for God's sake.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.802
So you're afraid?

02:14.843 --> 02:15.928
Of course we're fucking afraid.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.055
You don't deserve me.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.058
I declined the position.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.310
-Okay. -And then I resigned.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.270
She's leaving because she fell in love with you -- both of you.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.689
Go to the airport.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.190
Hey, assholes.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.818
We literally raced to the airport, which is, like,

02:30.859 --> 02:34.446
the -- the rom-comiest of all rom-com tropes.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.073
And... Just to get here.

02:36.115 --> 02:36.949
But then what?

02:36.991 --> 02:38.784

03:21.785 --> 03:23.162
Jack: Shh.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.581
Need painkillers.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.583
Truth.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.464
Are you gonna get them?

03:34.506 --> 03:35.632
God, no.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.092
Ohh.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.468
Oh, fuck.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.762
Just fuck in general, or...?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.806
I quit my job.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.349
Yeah.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.727
Yep.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.395
Can't remember the actual reason.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.272
Something about doing what I want to do,

03:51.314 --> 03:52.983
but I think that's all I ever wanted to do.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.276
So you do it at another school, one where they have

03:55.318 --> 03:57.362
bigger problems than choosing the color

03:57.404 --> 03:58.780
for their sweet-16 Beemers.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.032
Solid idea.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.826
Let's call it a day.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.954
It's all downhill from here.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.085
Izzy. What happened to Izzy?

04:11.126 --> 04:12.669
Oh, my God, we lost her?

04:12.711 --> 04:13.628
She could be anywhere by now.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.175
Or there.

04:18.217 --> 04:20.928
What's that on her ass?

04:25.849 --> 04:27.184
"Edgy"?

04:27.226 --> 04:28.102
Oh, God.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.770
I have one, too?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.354
Izzy: Just go to sleep.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.481
Just stop talking.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.358
It's not "edgy."

04:35.400 --> 04:39.863
It's "E-J-I."

04:39.905 --> 04:41.615
Emma, Jack, Izzy.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.743
How the fuck did this happen?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.578
Oh, fuck.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.629
The adventure begins.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.967
Openly polyamorous adventure.

05:00.008 --> 05:00.968
Yep.

05:01.009 --> 05:01.885
Are you okay?

05:01.927 --> 05:04.179
Yeah.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.809
Oh, wait, did you...

05:08.850 --> 05:10.560
Uh, no.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.480
What's happening here, it's called "couples privilege."

05:13.521 --> 05:16.024
You both assume the unicorn would ride in the back.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.484
That's me.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.736
The unicorn -- the third.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.905
So, should we rotate?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.241
Or where do you want to sit?

05:24.283 --> 05:27.161
Mm, behind the wheel.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.536
Cool.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.957
-I guess so, yeah.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.334
Ah, thank you.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.216
All right, buckle up, dickhead.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.759
Oh, that sounds about right.

05:42.801 --> 05:43.885
What's that, babe?

05:43.927 --> 05:46.054
Nothing. Yes, let's do this.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.264
Let's do this.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.141
This is a big-ass car.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.767
Whee!

05:50.809 --> 05:54.771
-Trick or treat! -Be safe kids.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.648
Aye, there, landlubber.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.441
How you doin', sheriff?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.986
It's tough to tell the stoned teenagers from the real hookers.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.988
Time to put this little octopus to bed.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.825
Up and go.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.576
Oh, good Lord.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.454
Ladies, what is the actual objective here?

06:11.496 --> 06:14.208
Post-post-post-feminist empowerment.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.292
Mm-hmm.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.627
You playing that card

06:17.669 --> 06:21.048
Hold on, I think I have some self-esteem in here somewhere.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.465
Good one.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.218
Yeah, I love it when old people try to be clever.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.969
Totes adorbs.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.348
Let's go, guys.

06:29.388 --> 06:33.768
Oh, look, Lori Matherfield here in our yard.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.187
Jack

06:35.229 --> 06:37.480
Ouch.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.482
I guess I deserve that, huh?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.026
Hey, I don't want to be a dick here,

06:41.068 --> 06:42.903
but we got to get inside and put these little

06:42.944 --> 06:44.279
crustaceans to bed, so...

06:44.321 --> 06:47.866
I-I-I was wrong about the Trakarskys.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.119
Oh, no, I wouldn't beat yourself up too bad about that.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.038
Too late.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.208
I'm really sorry for all of the tumult that I caused.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.210
Water under the bridge. You know what?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.962
It was confusing for all of us, so...no blood, no foul.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.047
Okay?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.798
Please.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.051
As if the Trakarskys went all sexually deviant

07:06.093 --> 07:08.178
with some college chick and then crafted this

07:08.220 --> 07:10.055
elaborate cover-up that she was their niece --

07:10.097 --> 07:12.015
that is just crazy.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.934
It's nut-zoid. Like unthinkable.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.518
Bonkers. Outlandish.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.229
Preposterous. You know, they're actually

07:17.271 --> 07:19.231
a very vanilla couple if you know that term.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.732
Don't even look at each other naked.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.733
They think HBO is porn.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.984
Well, it kind of is.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.237
Can you believe that Jack turned down

07:25.279 --> 07:27.614
the promotion <i>and</i> quit his job today?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.741
I mean, who saw that coming?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.160
Oh, you -- you didn't know.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.536
That can't be good.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.455
How's that, Dave

07:35.496 --> 07:36.790
Why is that not good? No, he just means...

07:36.831 --> 07:38.917
Mid-life crisis, probably. I don't know.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.460
What's next

07:40.501 --> 07:41.878
Hydroponics

07:41.920 --> 07:43.504
Frosted tips

07:48.593 --> 07:50.011
So, that happened.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.554
Was that the niece?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.514
I thought they said she was leaving for, uh...

07:53.556 --> 07:54.515
Jack. Emma.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.101
Emma. Jack or Emma.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.852
Probably one of the two Trakar-- That's the Trakarsky...

07:57.894 --> 07:58.937
A Trakarsky was driving that car.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.439
...family vehicle, yeah.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.815
Wouldn't have been the third one. She left town.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.191
Izzy. Jack's niece.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.193
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna...

08:05.235 --> 08:07.528
You people are still just a little strange.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.157
All right, nighty-night. Great.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.057
declined his promotion and quit his job yesterday?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.643
'Cause the Amaris, they didn't know anything about it.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.731
That doesn't make any sense.

What are you, taking a shift for Lori?

Hey, what do I get if I pretend you're funny?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.723

10:40.765 --> 10:42.225
I shouldn't be vague about something this important.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.518
I'm talking about a blowjob.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.019
It's almost 2:00 in the afternoon,

10:45.061 --> 10:46.729
and they haven't even come out for the paper yet.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.189
Called Emma like seven times.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.857
Honey, I'm going to play one-on-one

10:49.899 --> 10:51.025

10:55.738 --> 10:57.698
What Come on.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.033
You're not turned on by the idea of me

10:59.075 --> 11:00.368
waging battle on the court

11:01.869 --> 11:03.788
No, it's cool.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.039
It's professional.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.707
I can't. I just can't.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.793
You know, this is all standard issue top to bottom.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.963
This is what the pros wear.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.798
The shorts are too long for my body, though.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.635
I get that.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.016
I feel like we should've worked our way up to that, you know?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.060
My dick is broken.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.272
I think we're gonna have to

11:29.314 --> 11:32.484
MacGyver some sort of penis splint.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.069
I feel like I have full-body hernia.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.197
Yeah, I'm so winded.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.407
I feel like I need to back off the weed

11:39.449 --> 11:41.409
or go for a walk or eat something

11:41.451 --> 11:45.372
that doesn't come delivered in a cardboard box probably.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.127
That being said, you guys want to go again?

11:51.169 --> 11:54.464
Mm, as long as I don't have to move or do anything at all.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.383
I mean that. I mean that literally.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.885
Like -- like I'm a blow-up doll.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.848
I can't feel my tongue.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.517
Am I talking funny?

12:05.559 --> 12:07.935
No. No.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.237

Sh-- She promised to call,

13:52.873 --> 13:57.211
and I've been texting since last night, and nothing.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.422
So... Neen.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.258
I think her plane crashed.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.051
You really think that her plane crashed?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.844
Well, obviously not. Okay, it's just...

14:05.886 --> 14:08.931
Her fiery death is better than getting shut down?

Okay. Okay.

You know what? I'm not usually one for next-day hugging.

Uh, could you possibly keep it a little less simple?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.559
So, you told me that this was over.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.395
And now Izzy's back, Jack quit his job?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.813
Wait a second -- did you quit your job

14:56.855 --> 14:58.105

No, I-I quit my job...um...

I can't remember, but it was something really profound.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.948
Oh, shit. Um, I got to go.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.200
What's up?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.077
Nina's been texting since last night.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.747
Pretty sure I'm walking into a serious ass-kicking.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.790
Hey, Jack.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.584
Did you have any engagements today

15:17.625 --> 15:19.377
that you may have forgotten about?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.254
Here's a clue. My husband's wearing

15:21.295 --> 15:23.339
oversized shorts, knee socks, a headband.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.174
And God damn it, do you know how hard it is

15:25.216 --> 15:27.218
to unsee that shit so I can have sex with him again?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.969
Totally forgot about that.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.471
Fuck.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.265
By the way, I agree with you on the outfit.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.560
As a man, I am embarrassed by him.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.270
Bye.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.358
-Bye. -Bye.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.818
Bye, Carmen.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.152
-Bye, Izzy. -Have a nice day.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.320
Is that your bra?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.947
No, that's mine.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.574
So, what are you saying

15:49.616 --> 15:51.785
Carmen said this was, like, sexually off-putting to her.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.953
How is that possible? It's regulation top to bottom.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.122
Look at this. You can get a little nipple slip

15:53.994 --> 15:56.122
on the side for free.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.499
That is absurd. Absurd?

15:58.541 --> 15:59.918
It's like a little retro, too.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.753
You look like you're in, like, a '70s porn movie.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.630
That's exactly what I was going for.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.215
At least I showed up on time to play in some games.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.425
Sorry, man. Ridiculous.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.760
Your time management is ridiculous.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.470
Okay, fine, just go. So what's the deal?

16:10.511 --> 16:13.055
The three of you are back together now?

16:10.511 --> 16:13.055
Huh

16:13.097 --> 16:15.224
You gonna play out this whole four

16:15.266 --> 16:18.102
In.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.312
Actually, she's moving in.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.689
We're throupling.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.399
Throupling? Yeah, it's a word.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.109
If that's a word, it is fucking stupid,

16:25.151 --> 16:26.611
and you should never use it.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.738
Although, I mean, this whole thing is fucking stupid.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.740
So why shouldn't you make up your own vocabulary.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.492
-It's not stupid. -Off.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.786
Are you seriously worried that your children

16:34.828 --> 16:36.746
will be scarred because three consenting adults

16:36.788 --> 16:38.122
live across the street from you?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.708
I am, which surprises me, and I resent it.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.794
I blame you for making me feel uncool

16:42.836 --> 16:47.089
in a highly Matherfield kind of way.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.176
We've exposed your inner Lori.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.846
That is cruel. More.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.597
We're in love. I'm in love with both of them.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.933
Oh, you're in love with both of them?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.309
Equally?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.102
Your wife of nine years and the escort you hired

17:00.144 --> 17:02.229
five minutes ago

17:02.271 --> 17:04.315
Yeah, that seems reasonable.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.400
Remember that I said this, Jackson. This is all gonna end

17:04.357 --> 17:06.400
very badly for you.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.986
Thanks for the support, man.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.654
It's a bit more ominous than I expected, but thanks.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.197
What friends are for. Off.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.573
Swish.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.742
This is right here. You know what I'm saying?

17:14.784 --> 17:17.328
Our long-time best friends, who live directly

17:17.370 --> 17:19.873
across the street, invite some college chick

17:19.914 --> 17:22.166
into their marriage on a full-time basis

17:22.208 --> 17:24.711
to live in their house and sleep in their bed.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.128
I'm just -- I'm not down with it,

17:26.170 --> 17:27.964
and that makes me feel douchey, which, again,

17:28.006 --> 17:30.884
I fucking resent.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.719
Look at me.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.679
So now you're hitting on me like that's gonna fix everything?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.514
Carmen, look at me.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.974
Look at me. Whatever.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.351
Look at me.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.520
You have never been cool.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.898
I'm shocked to hear you think otherwise.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.902
Hey, let's find out how that blouse looks in red.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.362
Come here.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.197
Okay, fine.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.949
If you need to feel me up, I won't fight it.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.535
Oh, but it might be more fun if you struggle.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.246
God, you are such a perv now. I know.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.082
You know Emma was into chicks in college, right?

18:03.123 --> 18:06.460
Yeah. I think I'd know that. She's my fucking wife,

18:03.123 --> 18:06.460
I know everything about her.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.962
Okay, so you've known the whole time?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.338
No, she told me right after

18:09.380 --> 18:10.464
she made out with Izzy in the bathroom.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.549
Oh, okay.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.802
So Carmen, she told years ago,

18:14.844 --> 18:16.554
but you, she kept it a secret from.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.972
What's your point?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.599
I'm just saying, she seemed pretty eager

18:19.640 --> 18:21.059
to get back on that bike.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.352
Seemed to remember how to ride it pretty good, too.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.687
Off. What are you saying?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.647
That she's

18:26.689 --> 18:29.233
Like the last 11 years with me was just an experiment?

18:29.275 --> 18:33.613
No, maybe she's right down the middle, 50/50,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.322
equal-opportunity bisexual.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.076
Or...maybe she decided

18:38.117 --> 18:39.285
she likes one flavor more than another,

18:39.326 --> 18:40.578
if you catch my drift.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.205
Off.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.792
-We both know

18:43.247 --> 18:45.792
what you need to do.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.919
Maybe you can give me a hint.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.423
Get some chloroform and a rag and a crate,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.842
and you ship Miss Sex Fairy back to Botslavia.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.594
That is so offensive.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.345
First of all, I mean, chloroform?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.345
Offensive to who?

18:58.387 --> 18:59.847
People from Botslavia? That's not a real place.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.933
Jesus Christ, man. Think about what you're saying.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.477
The point I'm making is you hightail her ass out of here.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.729
Nobody's taking anybody anywhere, okay?

19:06.771 --> 19:08.481
This is happening. We are happening.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.983
Wipe that look off your face.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.735
I don't want to see that look. We are happening.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.862
You really sound like you're trying to convince somebody.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.072
Is it me, or is it you?

19:16.114 --> 19:18.116
I'm not trying to convince anybody.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.909
You do remember we're having everybody over

19:19.951 --> 19:21.869
for the game tomorrow, right?

19:21.911 --> 19:23.871
The Matherfields are coming.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.999
Gabe and Marie, too.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.001
Oh. Don't be ridiculous.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.003
You know I live for parties

19:30.044 --> 19:33.547
built around televised sporting...matches.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.133
Football. It's called football.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.383
Mm, and I've thought of little else

19:36.425 --> 19:38.218
since you invited us.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.305
Yeah, well, the point is...

19:41.347 --> 19:44.475
are you bringing Izzy?

19:48.771 --> 19:51.149
Margaritas and drive-through burritos.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.566
I remember when that was our thing,

19:52.608 --> 19:55.069
like a week ago.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.445
It just had to be the tequila.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.031
Cuervo's law.

19:58.072 --> 20:02.326
Where the fuck have you been?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.286
They came after me.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.539
It was super-romantic. It was like -- Ow!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.166
And you didn't call and tell me this?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.376
You couldn't respond to just one of my 8,000 texts?

20:10.417 --> 20:12.086
What about<i> you?</i>

20:12.128 --> 20:13.796
Breaking all kinds of girl code

20:13.838 --> 20:18.051
with Andy's penis and burritos and tequila.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.260
Best scavenger hunt ever.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.346
Okay, look, if you guys want me to go, I could just --

20:22.388 --> 20:23.305
-Go. -Go.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.724
Whoa.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.933
Sorry, Boo.

20:25.975 --> 20:26.976
Boo?

20:27.018 --> 20:28.186
Yeah, I'm bringing it back.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.729
Really? Really.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.064
Ugh!

20:32.940 --> 20:34.525
Ow!

20:34.567 --> 20:36.069
Okay, bye.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.154
God, do you know how ridiculous you sound?

20:42.408 --> 20:45.161
How does that feel, huh?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.122
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

20:48.164 --> 20:49.957
Stop, fuck, truce!

20:49.999 --> 20:51.458
Ow!

20:51.500 --> 20:52.877
Ow.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.170
Ow, I should have seen that coming.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.379
Obvious counter-move.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.923
Ouch.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.382
See how worried I've been?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.800
I hoped your plane crashed.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.343
You mean you thought my plane crashed?

21:01.385 --> 21:03.345
No, I<i> hoped</i> your plane crashed

21:03.387 --> 21:05.014
because that's the only acceptable excuse

21:05.056 --> 21:06.099
for not fucking calling me.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.517
You're right. I'm sorry.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.728
Well, you should be.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.396
You're cleaning that shit up.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.315
I will.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.000
So, what's going on with you?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.877
You dating the Griswolds or what?

21:40.716 --> 21:44.178
What are you doing?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.557
My November rent.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.517
Only fair, 'cause I didn't give you any notice.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.895
No.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.608
Yes.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.320
Don't bother inviting me to any of the dumbass block

21:57.650 --> 22:01.320
parties or barbecues, okay?

22:01.361 --> 22:04.198
Come on, Nin. We're best friends.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.741
Did you seriously just BFF me,

22:05.783 --> 22:07.326
you condescending little carpet muncher?

22:07.367 --> 22:09.745
Homophobia -- that's very classy.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.455
Fuck off.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.124
Nina, come on. You know what?

22:13.166 --> 22:15.375
Suddenly I don't give a shit, okay?

22:15.417 --> 22:19.379
So get out, 'cause I got to get pretty for your ex.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.466
Yeah, tequila makes us really frisky.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.679
That's very sweet.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.685
Hope it works out for you, rebound girl.

22:32.726 --> 22:36.230
Yeah, you better fucking run!

Uh

23:12.725 --> 23:14.894
You're gonna need that.

23:14.935 --> 23:15.936
Okay.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.646
Told him to keep them coming.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.733
I said, "Keep them coming, sugar tits."

23:20.774 --> 23:22.276
Always wanted to say that.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.944
Only I didn't say "sugar tits."

23:23.986 --> 23:26.989
I hope not. Otherwise these would probably be urine shots.

Hey, you.

Hey. Hi.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.752
Wow, it went well for you, too, huh?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.962
Yep.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.840
It was fucking awesome.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.676
After jamming most of my own hand down my throat,

23:47.718 --> 23:50.596
my best friend called me a homewrecking psychopath

23:50.637 --> 23:53.557
and then threw me out so she could pork my ex.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.184
Such a complicated friendship.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.394
Mm.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.188
The fighting part used to be fun.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.149
You know, Dave also cast you as the homewrecker.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.317
Sweet. Do tell.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.736
Yeah, he said you are a sex fairy

24:05.778 --> 24:08.655
and that we should pack you up and ship you far, far away.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.367
A sex fairy? I know.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.619
Carmen -- Carmen came this close

24:13.660 --> 24:16.163
to saying that we don't belong in the neighborhood anymore.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.999
Yeah, and then she blamed<i> me</i> for making her feel uncool.

24:20.458 --> 24:23.379
Bougie, judgmental, suburban assholes.

24:23.421 --> 24:24.422
So, are we getting fucked up?

24:24.462 --> 24:25.965
Apparently so.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.300
Yeah, and you know what?

24:27.341 --> 24:29.676
After, we're gonna egg some houses, bitches.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.552
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.552
Yes.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.762
Well...no. Mnh-mnh.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.180
I don't think that's a good idea.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.514
No, I will not be doing that.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.514
Why?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.808
Bitches won't be egging any houses.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.726
But I do agree with the sentiment.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.812
What's the sentiment?

24:39.853 --> 24:42.773
You walked out of the Hamilton School for a reason.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.859
Right. What was my statement?

24:45.901 --> 24:47.694
Wh

24:47.736 --> 24:49.529
It was a declaration of independence.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.992
Yeah, right. We'll go with that, definitely.

24:53.033 --> 24:56.745
Yeah, I mean, we -- people, we're making a choice.

24:56.787 --> 25:00.749
This is<i> our</i> life.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.500
Our lives.

25:02.542 --> 25:07.423
These are our...lives. Honey.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.841
Come on, you know what I mean.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.801
I'm -- I'm pretty drunk.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.553
You're drunk but right. Fucking testify.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.553
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.721
I'll testify.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.349
We're gonna walk into that party

25:16.390 --> 25:18.516
with our hands high and our heads held.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.269
It's the reverse, but, yes.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.437
That was right. Yeah,

25:20.311 --> 25:21.437
the sentiment was there.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.813
Yeah. Yeah.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.191
Yeah, because we are taxpaying adult citizens.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.525
Right, some of us are. Yeah.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.028
Okay, well, I-I got paid in cash.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.528
But whatever. You know what I mean.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.699
This is our choice, and this is what we want.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.992
Am I right, people?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.369
You are right. I am right.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.829
Could you possibly keep it down over there?

25:40.373 --> 25:42.791
Could you possibly blow me, Ann Coulter?

25:43.917 --> 25:46.045
That was awesome.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.130
Yikes. A little bit scary.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.049
Um, okay. Is the

25:50.090 --> 25:51.300
'Cause my arm's getting tired.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.801
Can we drink these? Let's do it.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.221
Cheers, guys.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.389
Mm-hmm.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.807
Mm.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.268
So now we need to make our statement.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.936
Right, like a protest.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.980
Protest. Protest.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.400
It -- It needs to be

26:07.441 --> 26:10.528
something that says, "Fuck all y'all."

26:10.568 --> 26:12.363
Yeah.

26:12.405 --> 26:16.450
Yeah, like, something like -- something like fuck all y'all!

26:16.492 --> 26:19.203
That was exactly the same thing, just yelling it louder.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.081
Mm-hmm. Think maybe, like,

26:19.245 --> 26:22.081
a new statement?

26:22.122 --> 26:23.499
What is our statement?

26:23.541 --> 26:26.043
It's...just do it. Um...

26:26.085 --> 26:27.878
Just... Do it.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.587
Just do it. No, 'cause I think

26:27.920 --> 26:29.587
that's taken.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.131
That's taken. Well, three's, uh...

26:31.173 --> 26:32.799
Um... Three's<i> not</i> company.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.135
...a crowd, but not now.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.554
Poly power.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.222
Domestic bliss with a twist.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.058
Thrice for the throuple.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.393
Three's...

26:42.435 --> 26:43.727
Thrice for the throuple!

26:43.769 --> 26:45.896
Do you know the word "cunt" used to be --

26:45.938 --> 26:48.357
it meant "cozy" when Chaucer used it.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.942
Excuse me, buddy?

26:49.983 --> 26:51.026
Can we have a couple more?

26:51.068 --> 26:52.194
Mm. No.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.946
Oh. So, V.V.P.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.197
You down with V.V.P.?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.323
Vagina, vagina, penis?

26:56.365 --> 26:57.366
Yeah. No.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.201
Yeah, you know me?

26:59.243 --> 27:00.369
V.V.P.!

27:00.411 --> 27:02.162
Yeah, you know me! I love it.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.498
Oh, my God, these are the worst statements ever.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.791
I know. Um...

27:05.832 --> 27:07.418
I got nothing.

27:09.627 --> 27:10.921
You know what?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.591
Let's just keep drinking and just --

27:13.631 --> 27:15.468
and -- and let the statement reveal itself.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.844
Right, yeah. Barkeep.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.138
Yeah. Yeah.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.024
Another one, sugar tits.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.653
Oh, like it was all <i>my</i> idea?

27:37.323 --> 27:41.160
You're right -- it was probably all my idea.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.744
Oh, my God, it's 1:00.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.788
Dave and Carm's party is, like, now.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.123
We can't go.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.124
They'll see these.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.626
Mm.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.628
No, they wouldn't, unless we go bottomless.

27:50.668 --> 27:51.837
And that would be super weird.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.881
Ah. Good point.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.634
We're doing this.

27:56.674 --> 27:57.635
