told you to talk.

Fox:
You already signed away
your life, you piece of shit.

00:50.077 --> 00:52.911
Go, go, go.
Oh my God. Go.

01:00.452 --> 01:01.744
-Felly: Get down.

-You're not going anywhere.
-Yeah, right there.

01:03.535 --> 01:06.535
-Are those straps tight enough?
-What did you get yourself into?

01:06.619 --> 01:09.035
-Felly: You said yes
to this, didn't you? Yes.
-Doc: No. Yes.

01:09.118 --> 01:11.702
Ayasha:
Where are we gonna take her?
Somewhere dirty.

01:11.786 --> 01:13.661
-Felly: Ooh. New Jersey?
-Doc: Oh, no-- not New Jersey.

01:13.744 --> 01:16.535
-Shut the fuck up now.
-Speak only when spoken to.

01:16.619 --> 01:19.702
-We'll take you to Gowanus.
-Yeah, Gowanus.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.243
-Sorry!
-It's all right,

02:20.035 --> 02:21.369
-Hey.
-Hmm?

02:21.452 --> 02:24.786
That was the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

None of your business.

-All right, one drink
and then bed.
-Yeah.

02:38.369 --> 02:40.786
-Whatever you want then.
-Maybe, maybe two drinks.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.952
-Did you invite a lot of people?
-Hilly: Uh-oh! He lives to tell.

02:44.035 --> 02:47.118

No, you don't.

-Happy birthday!
-Oh, my God.
I love you.

02:52.702 --> 02:53.827
-It was beyond.
-Beyond?

02:53.911 --> 02:56.452
Beyond. The best.
The best.

02:56.535 --> 02:58.869
-You doing a thing
with your nails?
-It's-- I know it's weird.

02:58.952 --> 03:00.494
-It's just a look.
-It's just a phase.

03:00.577 --> 03:02.869
-It's all right. You're
never too old, right?
-Exploration.

03:14.118 --> 03:16.577
(chatter, laughter)

03:16.661 --> 03:18.077
Doc:
But seriously,
you have to sign,

03:18.160 --> 03:19.702
like a stack
of forms like that.

03:19.786 --> 03:22.160
Well, I mean, you want
to cover your bases
when you're doing a--

03:22.243 --> 03:24.911
-What was it, an abduction?
-Mm-mm. It's a ravishing.

03:24.993 --> 03:26.327
Riley:
Oh, I'm sorry,
a ravishing.

03:26.410 --> 03:28.911
-More like a kidnapping.
-A sensual kidnapping.

03:28.993 --> 03:31.369
-A hot butch bang,
how about that?
-Very erotic.

03:31.452 --> 03:35.118
Pink, left, back pocket,
means my dog sleeps
in the bed.

03:35.202 --> 03:36.619
But if it's
in the right pocket,

03:36.702 --> 03:38.786
it means my dog does
not sleep in the bed.

03:38.869 --> 03:40.911
Okay, I like it.
What about the cats?

03:40.993 --> 03:43.160
Mmm, same thing but red.

03:43.243 --> 03:45.327
No, no I feel yellow
is more cat-like.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.077
All right, fuck it.
Yellow.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.369
It doesn't matter. Just making
it up as we go along, right?

03:49.452 --> 03:53.661
-Girl bang, boy bang,
slut pile...
-(laughs)

03:53.744 --> 03:56.952
-...fuck van,
shaggin' wagon.
-I... I hate that one.

03:57.035 --> 03:59.619
-Shaggin' wagon?
It's a little silly.
-I don't like that one at all.

03:59.702 --> 04:02.827
No, definitely not
in ketosis.

04:02.911 --> 04:04.911
That ship has long sailed.

04:05.702 --> 04:09.285
Doc:
Thirty years of exes,
all in my childhood kitchen.

04:09.369 --> 04:11.786
You were there,
and you were there,

04:11.869 --> 04:14.202
and you were there,
and you were there.

04:14.285 --> 04:17.077
All the way back to my
camp counselor, Carole,

04:17.160 --> 04:19.077
just sitting shiva,
talking shit about me.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.035
-Oh my God, you love that.
-Trish: So what do you think
the dream means?

04:22.118 --> 04:25.744
I think it means
she's a double Leo
and a pain in the ass.

04:25.827 --> 04:28.911
All:
Happy birthday!

04:28.993 --> 04:31.410
Hilly:
Happy birthday,
and many more!

04:31.494 --> 04:34.744
Um, I would just love to get
some feedback from you.

04:34.827 --> 04:37.577
You know, about
timing and technique.

04:37.661 --> 04:39.993
Oh-oh! I was the one
spitting into your mouth.

04:40.077 --> 04:41.661
Hilly:
So what do we owe
you for the van?

04:41.744 --> 04:44.577
I forgot about tip and gas,
so 75 each. Is that okay?

04:44.661 --> 04:45.952
Oh, let me get the tip.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.202
-Shush!
-Of course not,
it's your birthday.

04:48.285 --> 04:50.619
-Drink your water, oppa.
-Marigold: Yeah, Mr. Moneybags.

04:50.702 --> 04:53.535
-Hilly: What's your handle?
-Ayasha: It's just my name.

04:53.619 --> 04:55.327
Anybody have a cigarette?

04:56.285 --> 04:58.285
-(Doc sighs)
-Are you okay, buster?

04:58.369 --> 05:01.869
No, I got all the serotonin
fucked out of me.

05:03.410 --> 05:06.118
Can you take it easy today?
What's your day like?

05:06.202 --> 05:07.952
I gotta work
on this speech.

05:08.035 --> 05:09.786
This shit
never gets easier.

05:09.869 --> 05:12.744
This is just--
This is not happening.

05:12.827 --> 05:15.577
-My brain is not working.
-Listen, listen.

05:15.661 --> 05:18.160
You're the most
brilliant person
that I know.

05:18.243 --> 05:20.285
Come here.
I love this fucking brain.

05:20.369 --> 05:21.452
(chuckles)

05:21.535 --> 05:23.577
-It'll be great.
-We'll see.

05:23.661 --> 05:25.952
-Mmm.
-Yeah?

05:26.035 --> 05:28.494
(moaning)

05:28.577 --> 05:30.577
Mmm, that's nice.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.993
Are you making
dinner tonight?

05:34.077 --> 05:36.327
-I can.
-Can you save
me something?

05:36.410 --> 05:37.661
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

05:37.744 --> 05:38.952
Yeah.

05:40.410 --> 05:42.077
Well, I'm off.

05:42.619 --> 05:44.827
Babe, you need
new glasses.

05:44.911 --> 05:48.619

I'm a nice guy.

I'm really glad
you feel better.

07:50.952 --> 07:53.202
Mm-hmm, same.

07:57.202 --> 07:58.702
Make yourself a home.

07:58.786 --> 08:00.452
Stay a while.

08:00.535 --> 08:01.952
Just don't shit in here.

08:02.035 --> 08:04.786
Okay, well,
now you're ruining
my afternoon plans.

08:04.869 --> 08:07.202
-Have fun.
-Bye.

08:07.285 --> 08:08.369
(door closes)

08:08.452 --> 08:11.202
-That's a good coif.
-Doesn't she look great?

08:11.285 --> 08:13.243
Okay, now the suspense
is killing me.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.494
-I gotta see this.
-Wait, I'm not done
with you yet, okay?

08:16.577 --> 08:18.702
Do you need a trim?

08:18.786 --> 08:21.702
That's a sensitive
subject with me.
I'm a balding man.

08:21.786 --> 08:24.035
-Oh, there's
a little something there.
-Oh, come on.

08:24.118 --> 08:26.327
You're bald because
you have too much
testosterone.

08:26.410 --> 08:28.035
-The Guy: Balding.
-Yeah, it's good.

08:28.118 --> 08:30.993
That's why you got
that beard and that
chest hair. It's awesome.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.118
Wow, that's what's going on?
I thought it was Judaism.

08:34.202 --> 08:35.952
-Yeah, that, too.
-Do you like it?

08:36.035 --> 08:37.410
-I like it.
-Thank you.

08:37.494 --> 08:39.619
-I know that
we want Chocolope.
-There you go.

08:39.702 --> 08:41.243
And, Aya, you
want something?

08:41.327 --> 08:44.035
Um, can I get the cartridge
I got last time?
I think it was--

08:44.118 --> 08:45.661
-Yes, that one.
-This one.

08:45.744 --> 08:46.744
Oh shit.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.577
I gave all my cash
to the cleaners.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.993
Um, you can take
Venmo, right?

08:53.077 --> 08:54.827
I'm sorry, no.

08:54.911 --> 08:57.619
-Ayasha: You know what,
I have cash upstairs.
-No, it's all right. I got it.

08:57.702 --> 08:59.952
You can take Venmo.

09:01.744 --> 09:03.869
Yeah, I'll take it.

Yo, why did you Venmo
that back to me?

09:22.285 --> 09:24.369
Um, I don't like you
doing that.

09:24.452 --> 09:26.369
Yeah, but I'm booking
you for tonight,

09:26.452 --> 09:29.077
and it's that thing
you don't love doing,

09:29.160 --> 09:30.535
so just roll with it.

09:30.619 --> 09:32.535
That's not what
we're doing.

09:32.619 --> 09:35.535
Not what we're doing?
I thought this was
a hot power-play thing.

09:35.619 --> 09:38.744
-It is.
-Yeah, but I can't do
it to you? Come on.

09:38.827 --> 09:40.869
You should save
your money.

09:45.661 --> 09:47.118
Wow.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.369
-What?
-I'm-- Wow,
I'm an idiot.

09:53.452 --> 09:54.786
Why?

09:54.869 --> 09:56.744
Are you just, like,
giving me money now?

09:56.827 --> 09:59.786
Well, yeah, I gave you
like a thousand dollars
this month.

09:59.869 --> 10:01.744
I mean, what did you
think that was for?

10:01.827 --> 10:03.243
Yeah, but that was
our play money.

10:03.327 --> 10:06.369
I didn't even transfer
it into my bank.

10:06.452 --> 10:08.952
Can't you just let me
take care of you?

10:10.494 --> 10:11.744
I guess I just
didn't realize

10:11.827 --> 10:13.911
that you thought
I was doing so badly.

10:13.993 --> 10:16.077
That's not
what I meant.
That's not--

10:16.160 --> 10:18.535
I-I pay rent,
I get groceries.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.369
I know how
to take care of myself.

10:20.452 --> 10:23.285
I know, and I just--
I love you and I don't
want to see you struggle.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.619
I don't wanna take
your money, Doc.

10:25.702 --> 10:27.494
That is just silly.

10:27.577 --> 10:30.661
I mean, if we were married,
if I was your husband,

10:30.744 --> 10:32.494
this wouldn't
even be an issue.

10:32.577 --> 10:34.577
I don't wanna be
in that kind of relationship.

10:34.661 --> 10:36.577
Damn it.

10:39.993 --> 10:41.786
Hey...

10:41.869 --> 10:44.661
I owe you.

10:47.243 --> 10:48.285
(cries softly)

10:48.369 --> 10:50.535
I'm not that bad
with my money, okay?

10:50.619 --> 10:52.160
-I know.
-I'm trying.

10:52.243 --> 10:53.285
I know.

10:53.369 --> 10:54.869
And I never wanted
you to feel like

10:54.952 --> 10:56.786
I was with you
because of that reason.

10:56.869 --> 10:58.786
Hey, I have
never felt that.

10:58.869 --> 11:00.619
And I never felt
my age around you,

11:00.702 --> 11:02.118
and now I just
fucking do.

11:02.202 --> 11:04.577
I just feel like
a young, dumb person.

11:05.619 --> 11:06.744
No.

11:07.327 --> 11:09.202
I thought this
turned you on.

11:09.285 --> 11:10.243
(whispers):
It does.

11:10.327 --> 11:12.911
It's so hot
when you take it.

11:15.369 --> 11:18.577
I liked feeling like a hooker
and not some charity case.

11:19.911 --> 11:22.160
That's not-- Look, I--

11:22.243 --> 11:24.160
-I went about it
the wrong way.
-Yeah, you did.

11:24.243 --> 11:26.577
-I'm sorry.
-(door slams)

11:29.869 --> 11:31.911
(sighs)

11:47.786 --> 11:49.243
(whispers):
Shit.

11:55.285 --> 11:57.661
(slow pop music playing)

12:12.452 --> 12:14.118
(phone dings)

12:18.744 --> 12:21.452
(mutters):
You dirty little bitch.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.661
(dings)

12:27.827 --> 12:31.869
-I love you!
-Well, I'm not done yet!

12:33.243 --> 12:34.494
(phone dings)

12:35.285 --> 12:37.494
(horn honking)

12:40.827 --> 12:42.202
(zipper zips)

12:42.285 --> 12:44.285
-(horn honks)
-(mutters)

12:47.661 --> 12:49.285
Bill:
Um...

12:49.369 --> 12:50.869
Hey.

12:50.952 --> 12:51.911
Mm-hmm?

12:51.993 --> 12:54.243
-My car's here,
I gotta go.
-Okay.

12:54.327 --> 12:56.327
-Text you from
the flight?
-Great.

12:56.410 --> 12:57.410
Don't you have to get up?

12:57.494 --> 12:59.619
It's summer school.
No one cares.

12:59.702 --> 13:01.243
All right. Love you.

13:01.327 --> 13:02.702
(sighs)

13:02.786 --> 13:04.118
Love you, too.

13:04.202 --> 13:06.327
(door opens, closes)

13:07.243 --> 13:09.410
(distant siren wails)

13:26.369 --> 13:27.911
Ms. Farad?

13:31.077 --> 13:33.577
-Ms. Farad!
-Teddy, yes. What?

13:33.661 --> 13:36.702
What are we doing today?
We've been sitting here
for like 20 minutes now.

13:36.786 --> 13:39.410
Okay, it's not been 20 minutes.

13:39.494 --> 13:41.369
Check this out.

13:43.619 --> 13:46.118
-We're watching Glory  today.
-(students groan)

13:46.202 --> 13:48.494
But we already watched
that in the regular
school year.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.827
We, like, know
that one already.

13:49.911 --> 13:51.827
-(phone dings)
-We are watching Glory  again,

13:51.911 --> 13:54.327
and you can quote
along with it.

13:54.410 --> 13:55.952
Denise, lights.

14:02.243 --> 14:03.577
Thank you, Denise.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.952
(humming)

14:51.577 --> 14:53.077
Does anyone want
to get a drink tonight?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.744
-Oh my God, yes!
-Great!

14:54.827 --> 14:55.869
Hell yeah!

14:55.952 --> 14:58.535
-Can we go now?
-Yeah, I'm totally down.

14:58.619 --> 14:59.786
(chattering)

14:59.869 --> 15:01.369
Ezra:
Did you guys know
that years ago,

15:01.452 --> 15:03.494
Rikers Island,
the prisoners struck

15:03.577 --> 15:06.243
because they didn't want
to get served lobster anymore?

15:06.327 --> 15:07.452
-Why?
-What?

15:07.535 --> 15:10.202
'Cause they used to serve it
all the time.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.535
And now it's like
rich people food.

15:12.619 --> 15:13.993
What?

15:14.702 --> 15:17.410
(cackling)

15:17.494 --> 15:18.911
-Farad: Stupid!
-Gerard: That's good.

15:18.993 --> 15:21.744
Stupid, but like
funny stupid.

15:21.827 --> 15:24.827
(cackling)

15:27.369 --> 15:29.410
-I like your hair. It's cute.
-Thank you.

15:29.494 --> 15:30.577
Fuck.

15:30.661 --> 15:32.952
-Pretty good, huh?
-Yeah.

15:33.035 --> 15:35.410
-You want one?
-Uh, no, I'm good.

15:35.494 --> 15:37.702
No, you want a tot.

15:39.202 --> 15:40.535
(mutters)

15:40.619 --> 15:42.077
(chuckles)

15:42.160 --> 15:43.077
(laughs)

15:43.160 --> 15:44.410
-It's good, right?
-Mm-hmm.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.285
You like softball games?

15:46.369 --> 15:49.243
Softball? Did you know
I was a catcher for 14 years?

15:49.327 --> 15:51.619
-Oh, really?
-And that's why my
hips are really open.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.869
Because when you squat,
your hips open up,

15:54.952 --> 15:56.452
and so then you
can do the splits.

15:56.535 --> 15:58.118
-You can do the splits?
-On both sides.

15:58.202 --> 15:59.702
Betty:
He's not good for her.
He's gonna bring her down.

15:59.786 --> 16:01.786
She hasn't raised her hand
in the last two weeks.

16:01.869 --> 16:04.452
What, who? Tall Alex
or weird-eye Alex?

16:04.535 --> 16:07.452
-Girl, weird-eye.
-He has a weird eye?

16:07.535 --> 16:10.410
-You know, he's like...
-Ooh! I like them together!

16:10.494 --> 16:13.911
No, you can't. They'll never
see eye to eye, Betty.

16:13.993 --> 16:18.452
-They'll never see... (laughing)
-That's mean, that's mean.

16:18.535 --> 16:20.827
I'm just gonna--
Little bit closer.

16:24.452 --> 16:28.702
You don't have anything
like Shout at your
apartment, do you?

16:31.744 --> 16:35.410
-I-- I think
I'm done here.
-Yeah, same.

16:39.535 --> 16:41.577
Well, friends,
my stomach's doing
janky things,

16:41.661 --> 16:43.077
so I think I'm gonna
just head out.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.786
-What? No!
-Aw, come on.

16:44.869 --> 16:46.327
You know what?
I should probably
go, too.

16:46.410 --> 16:47.869
-What?
-No!

16:47.952 --> 16:49.577
Hey, can we split a car?
Do you want to just--

16:49.661 --> 16:51.035
-Stay. She's staying.
-Sure. Okay.

16:51.118 --> 16:52.577
Ezra:
I should probably
get out of here, too.

16:52.661 --> 16:54.327
-Oh, dropping like flies.
-Okay. Gonna go, bye!

16:54.410 --> 16:56.160
Yes, okay, bye!
See you guys tomorrow, okay?

16:56.243 --> 16:58.993
-All right.
-Ezra: You guys, this was
super fun though, right?

16:59.077 --> 17:03.410
It was awesome to,
like, get to know each
and every one of you.

17:08.118 --> 17:09.993
-(laughing): Bye.
-See ya.

17:10.077 --> 17:12.786
-Ezra: Wow.
-(both panting)

17:12.869 --> 17:14.993
You weren't kidding
about the splits, huh?

17:15.077 --> 17:16.327
Farad:
Yup. Yup.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.786
-(phone buzzing)
-Ezra: Yeah? Yeah? Yeah.

17:19.869 --> 17:23.202
-(panting)
-(grunting)

17:23.285 --> 17:25.535
-Okay. Slow.
-That's better.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.369
-Slow?
-I'll do it.

17:27.452 --> 17:28.494
Okay.

17:28.577 --> 17:30.035
(panting)

17:30.118 --> 17:32.285
-That's good.
-Shh.

17:33.827 --> 17:35.993
(grunting, moaning)

17:36.077 --> 17:38.202
-(both scream)
-What, what, what, what?

17:38.285 --> 17:40.202
I just had my gall bladder
out like two weeks ago.

17:40.285 --> 17:42.702
-Oh my God.
Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

17:42.786 --> 17:44.160
-Okay.
-You okay?

17:44.243 --> 17:46.285
I mean, I'm fine, yeah.

17:47.452 --> 17:49.202
So it's not the kind
that you pass?

17:49.285 --> 17:50.702
No, no, that's
a kidney stone.

17:50.786 --> 17:52.410
Oh, right, right.

17:52.494 --> 17:53.993
-(grunting)
-(moans) Yeah.

17:54.077 --> 17:55.786
(Ezra laughs)

17:55.869 --> 17:58.869
-What's funny?
-Nothing, it's just crazy.

17:58.993 --> 18:00.494
(both laughing)

18:02.160 --> 18:04.619
-It's okay.
-All right.
Keep going, keep going.

18:11.243 --> 18:14.243
The Guy:
Aw, man. Look at
all those pop-up ads.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.869
Uh, translate.
Right there.

18:19.661 --> 18:25.327
Okay, "If you want
to roll like a real
Brooklyn night gangster,

18:25.410 --> 18:28.661
"then call or write
a letter to this number

18:28.744 --> 18:31.243
and say you are
a friend of Chad."

18:31.327 --> 18:34.243
Hmm. Wow. Uh...

18:34.327 --> 18:36.619
"The hairy sales person

18:36.702 --> 18:40.369
will bring you sticky
buds in a while."

18:41.577 --> 18:42.619
Huh.

18:42.702 --> 18:44.285
This is a popular website?

18:44.369 --> 18:48.702
Yes, it's for tourists
who want to know
what's cool.

18:48.786 --> 18:51.661
Well, it definitely
explains some things.

18:51.744 --> 18:53.118
Thank you for showing me.

18:53.202 --> 18:55.452
-(phone dings)
-And, uh, could you
send me a link?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.202
-Oh, mm.
-Yeah.

18:57.285 --> 18:59.744
I wanna translate
the comments.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.077
(phone bloops)

19:02.160 --> 19:05.786
Well, I hope you enjoy
the rest of your trip.

19:05.869 --> 19:08.911
-Excuse me, um...
-Yeah?

19:08.993 --> 19:11.952
(speaking Japanese)

19:12.035 --> 19:13.410
(speaks Japanese)

19:13.494 --> 19:19.577
Uh, do you know
where can we find
a Banksy art work?

19:19.661 --> 19:23.243
Oh. Let me let you
in on a little secret.

19:24.744 --> 19:26.077
(whispers):
I'm Banksy.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.243
(laughs, speaks Japanese)

19:29.327 --> 19:31.619
(both speaking Japanese)

19:33.786 --> 19:35.494
Yeah, it's me.

19:35.577 --> 19:36.744
(knock on door)

19:36.827 --> 19:39.118
-Hey, hey. Come on in.
-Hey. What's going on?

19:39.202 --> 19:40.869
Not much.
How's it going?

19:40.952 --> 19:43.118
Uh, not much.

19:43.993 --> 19:46.535
Um, thanks a lot
for coming out here, man.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.243
I'm obviously not
at home right now.

19:49.327 --> 19:50.702
At a friend's place.

19:50.786 --> 19:52.494
-Yeah, that's cool.
-Cool.

19:52.577 --> 19:55.993
Yeah. Anyway, thanks.
We had some drinks
and you know how it goes.

19:56.077 --> 19:58.035
-Yeah.
Hey, what's up?
-Hey.

19:58.118 --> 20:03.494
Oh, uh, this is
my colleague, um,
Ms. Farad-- Mrs. Farad.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.661
-Karen.
-Hi, Karen.

20:05.744 --> 20:08.327
Couple of Brooklyn
night gangsters, I got ya.

20:08.410 --> 20:10.577
-Ezra: What?
-(clears throat) Shh.

20:10.661 --> 20:12.243
Never mind.
Forget it.

20:12.327 --> 20:15.535
So, uh, Headband,
Space Queen?

20:15.619 --> 20:17.243
Both.

20:17.327 --> 20:20.369
-All right,
that's a hundred.
-Farad: Great.

20:20.452 --> 20:23.035
-Ezra: Uh...
-Can I Venmo you?

20:23.118 --> 20:26.786
-Ezra: Usually he doesn't--
-I guess I'm gonna start.

20:26.869 --> 20:28.118
(phone dings)

20:31.494 --> 20:33.702
-Oh, God.
-What?

20:33.786 --> 20:35.661
I think that might have
been a really dumb move.

20:35.744 --> 20:38.327
-Why?
-He knows my wife.

20:38.410 --> 20:41.202
-We see him
like every week.
-He doesn't care.

20:41.285 --> 20:43.993
What if he does, though?
They kind of have a rapport.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.827
She took a splinter
out of his foot one time.

20:47.369 --> 20:49.285
I promise you, as long
as you pay him for weed,

20:49.369 --> 20:51.619
he couldn't care less.

20:52.494 --> 20:54.952
No, yeah, yeah.
You're probably right.

20:56.243 --> 20:58.118
Yeah, he wouldn't
say something to Reagan.

20:58.202 --> 20:59.494
Why would he?

21:01.952 --> 21:03.911
(both sighing)

21:03.993 --> 21:07.243
-(TV playing indistinctly)
-Ezra: I got nothing
but open nights here.

21:07.327 --> 21:10.452
-I fucking hate
being a teacher.
-Oh, me too.

21:10.535 --> 21:11.869
Thursday?

21:11.952 --> 21:13.577
Um, yeah.

21:13.661 --> 21:17.952
Well, no, I should--
I should probably be
home on Thursday.

21:18.952 --> 21:22.327
Well, Bill's gonna be
in Houston till the 23rd, so...

21:23.327 --> 21:24.744
All right,
how about Friday?

21:24.827 --> 21:28.661
Uh, Friday I'm going
to see Meredith Monk
at BAM, so...

21:28.744 --> 21:30.786
But you could come with.
(laughing) Wait...

21:30.869 --> 21:32.494
We can't go on a date.

21:32.577 --> 21:34.619
Can you imagine?
That'd be crazy.

21:34.702 --> 21:36.202
How about Monday?

21:36.285 --> 21:38.410
Monday I have to grade
quizzes, so...

21:40.494 --> 21:41.993
Oh, okay.

21:42.077 --> 21:44.202
Monday it is.

21:50.911 --> 21:52.577
(sighs)

21:54.494 --> 21:56.077
Can't help it.

21:57.410 --> 21:58.619
I feel a little guilty.

21:58.702 --> 22:00.869
I don't.
I feel really good.

22:05.118 --> 22:07.202
(phone chiming)

22:09.077 --> 22:11.035
(chiming continues)

22:44.452 --> 22:46.619
Yes!

22:46.702 --> 22:48.494
-What?
-I'm about it!

22:48.577 --> 22:50.744
-Well, thank you.
-Yes.

22:51.869 --> 22:54.494
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

22:54.577 --> 22:56.494
I want to kiss you
so bad right now.

22:56.577 --> 22:58.786
You better not.
(laughs)

22:58.869 --> 23:00.160
Well, I got you
a coffee, but...

23:00.243 --> 23:02.160
Oh, cute.
I can combine these.

23:05.827 --> 23:09.786
-Good morning.
Good morning.
-Morning. Hello.

23:10.452 --> 23:11.661
Farad:
How was your evening?

23:13.993 --> 23:16.410
-(screaming, laughing)
-Can you send it to me?

23:16.494 --> 23:17.702
-Wow!
-Lauryn: Don't tag
me in that,

23:17.786 --> 23:18.911
the whole thing
with the IRS.

23:18.993 --> 23:21.661
(cheers)
Gotta call my mom!

23:21.744 --> 23:23.786
-Do you know
what's going on?
-No.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.202
What's going on?
What is going on?

23:26.285 --> 23:28.911
I'm gonna buy a telescope
with my phone right now.

23:28.993 --> 23:31.494
We just won Take 5!

23:31.577 --> 23:32.744
Lauryn:
Yeah!

23:32.827 --> 23:34.702
Shut up!
What?

23:34.786 --> 23:36.077
Ezra:
Are you fucking serious?

23:36.160 --> 23:37.285
-Yes, Ezzy.
-Yeah.

23:37.369 --> 23:38.869
After you guys left--
Whose idea...?

23:38.952 --> 23:40.327
Oh. Betty, Betty.

23:40.410 --> 23:41.744
So we went to this
bodega, right.

23:41.827 --> 23:42.911
Basically,
we get in there--

23:42.993 --> 23:45.243
Betty says, "Let's get
a ticket together."

23:45.327 --> 23:47.243
-Brilliant!
-And then we won.

23:47.327 --> 23:50.243
-We won! We won!
-How much?

23:50.327 --> 23:51.661
-Twenty.
-Thousand?

23:51.744 --> 23:53.911
Ah! Yes, girl!
I can't even say it.

23:53.993 --> 23:55.285
Pilar:
We won!

23:55.369 --> 23:57.577
Like each?
No total, like total.

23:57.661 --> 24:00.243
-Lauryn: No, girl. Each!
-Girl, each.

24:00.327 --> 24:03.077
Wow, each!
Congrats!

24:03.160 --> 24:05.661
I've never won
anything in my life!

24:05.744 --> 24:09.160
-Until now.
-Like, I'm crying!
I'm honestly crying!

24:10.993 --> 24:12.869
Looks like you forgot
what crying is!

24:12.952 --> 24:16.619
Yes! ♪ We won some money!
We won some money! ♪

24:16.702 --> 24:19.827
-♪ We won some money! ♪
-Wow, I fucking went home!

24:19.911 --> 24:22.661
Oh, that's right.
How's your stomach?

24:22.744 --> 24:25.202
It's not good, Pilar.
It's not good!

24:25.285 --> 24:26.452
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

24:26.535 --> 24:29.327
(screaming, laughing)

24:29.410 --> 24:30.869
(Ezra shouts)

24:30.952 --> 24:33.702
Well, I'm gonna buy
every color pants
I've always wanted.

24:33.786 --> 24:34.869
(phone dings)

24:34.952 --> 24:36.369
Lauryn:
Now you can pay
for that therapy.

24:36.452 --> 24:38.202
You see what I'm saying?
You know what, fuck it--

24:38.285 --> 24:40.410
I'm getting
a motorcycle.

24:40.494 --> 24:41.869
Girl, you can get
that Botox!

24:41.952 --> 24:45.619
Pilar:
Yes! Girl, look...
Before 20, after 20.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.243
♪ Money, I got money  ♪

24:49.327 --> 24:51.202

24:54.243 --> 24:55.952
(speaking in Japanese)

25:51.619 --> 25:52.869
(phone beeping)

25:52.952 --> 25:54.410
Oh, boy.

25:55.369 --> 25:57.410
And that's what
a minute feels like.

25:58.243 --> 25:59.285
Can you believe
that a man

25:59.369 --> 26:01.077
did that
on national TV?

26:01.160 --> 26:04.369
-I love it!
-Oh. Which television show?

26:04.452 --> 26:07.035
It's called Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood.

26:07.118 --> 26:09.494
Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood.

26:09.577 --> 26:10.452
Yeah.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.035
(both speaking Japanese)

26:12.118 --> 26:13.702
Yeah, it's
a children's show,

26:14.118 --> 26:16.452
but I'd also
recommend it for adults.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.118
I'd recommend it
for anyone, actually.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.702
(both speaking
Japanese)

26:24.369 --> 26:25.827
Well, thank you.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.661
Both:
Thank you.

26:27.911 --> 26:29.077
And don't forget:

26:29.160 --> 26:30.911
"You're special,

26:30.993 --> 26:33.160
just the way
you are."

26:37.911 --> 26:40.118
The Guy:
Yeah.  Arigato.

26:47.327 --> 26:48.911
THE GUY: You're gonna wanna
just take a little bit.

26:48.993 --> 26:50.327
MAN:
So, like, a little nibble?

26:50.535 --> 26:52.035
THE GUY: Like a nibble
of a nibble.

26:52.118 --> 26:52.911
Micro.

26:52.993 --> 26:53.911
Right, that's why it's called--

26:53.993 --> 26:54.952
-Microdosing.
-Right.

26:55.827 --> 26:58.661
I never think of my age
until somebody reminds me.

26:58.744 --> 27:02.327
WOMAN: For real, though,
everyone is obsessed with you!

27:02.410 --> 27:04.410
WOMAN 2: Looks like
somebody else's skin.

27:04.911 --> 27:07.702
MAN: Tolerance to mushrooms
builds quickly.

27:07.786 --> 27:08.535
Oh.

27:08.869 --> 27:11.494
You know, your shell is part
of your skeleton.

27:11.911 --> 27:13.243
But it's also your home.
