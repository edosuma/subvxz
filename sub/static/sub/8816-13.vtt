Please stay green, please...

00:20.629 --> 00:22.964
Come on, come on!

00:22.998 --> 00:23.744
Damn it!

00:24.981 --> 00:26.681
Are we there?! Are we at camp?!

00:26.716 --> 00:28.116
Almost, honey.

00:28.150 --> 00:30.785
One f'ing light in this craphole town,

00:30.820 --> 00:33.522
and I hit it every mother-loving year.

00:33.556 --> 00:34.956
I can see the entrance!

00:34.991 --> 00:36.625
You guys are so lucky you get to live

00:36.659 --> 00:38.426
next to the best place in the world.

00:39.003 --> 00:41.062
Hey! That guy's got a sleeping bag!

00:41.097 --> 00:43.131
Mom, maybe he needs a ride to camp!

00:43.165 --> 00:45.367
Whole town's got the camp spirit.

00:45.401 --> 00:48.103
Not too close to the fire, boys!
You'll burn your dogs!

00:48.137 --> 00:50.472
But that's how my
friend Snot likes them!

00:50.506 --> 00:52.307
We're finally in the
big-boy cabin this year!

00:52.341 --> 00:53.608
Can you believe it?!

00:55.444 --> 00:56.811
Oh, arts and crafts.

Looks like someone was in such a rush,

02:00.543 --> 02:01.743
he forgot his sleeping bag.

02:01.777 --> 02:03.678
No matter. You can share mine.

02:03.713 --> 02:05.013
We'll just sleep nose-to-nose...

02:05.047 --> 02:07.482
keep our privates at
a respectful distance

02:07.516 --> 02:08.883
and our faces...

02:08.918 --> 02:10.085
mashed together, I guess.

02:10.119 --> 02:12.354
Actually, Steve, I won't need

02:12.388 --> 02:13.555
my own bedding this summer,

02:13.589 --> 02:14.990
'cause I have <i>this.</i>

02:15.024 --> 02:16.225
Whoa, buddy!

02:16.225 --> 02:18.560
Only counselors are
allowed to have whistles.

02:18.594 --> 02:20.095
Wait. Are you...

02:20.129 --> 02:21.696
A counselor-in-training.

02:21.731 --> 02:23.932
My whistle's corked so
you can't blow through it.

02:23.966 --> 02:27.869
But Chief Danny says if I do
a good job with the Lil' Apaches,

02:27.903 --> 02:30.872
I'll get full whistle privileges.

02:30.906 --> 02:33.908
How...'s it going, boys?

02:33.943 --> 02:35.644
I tell ya, Steve, every time I see you,

02:35.678 --> 02:37.312
I just want to give you a wedgie!

02:37.346 --> 02:39.748
You've got a wedgie face.
Anyone ever tell you that?

02:39.782 --> 02:41.349
I usually get "Ellen Page."

02:41.384 --> 02:42.851
But I'm a big Cherokee now,

02:42.885 --> 02:44.886
so <i>I'll</i> be the one giving the wedgies.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.855
Actually, no one will be giving wedgies.

02:46.889 --> 02:49.724
Thanks to a lawsuit that until now,
I was sure <i>you'd</i> filed,

02:49.759 --> 02:52.360
we have a zero-tolerance
policy for bullying.

02:52.395 --> 02:54.062
I don't like it personally,

02:54.096 --> 02:56.898
but it's really helpful for
the wimps and the Polacks.

02:58.868 --> 03:02.037
Why would you choose to be a
C.I.T. instead of a camper?

03:02.071 --> 03:04.239
If you're a C.I.T.,
you don't have to pay.

03:04.273 --> 03:06.708
It's the only way I could
afford to come this year.

03:06.742 --> 03:08.309
I always forget how poor you are.

03:08.344 --> 03:10.111
I drink generic milk.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.914
It's gray and comes in a bag.

03:12.948 --> 03:15.750
I think it's softening my bones.

03:15.785 --> 03:17.585
But I promise you,
nothing is going to change

03:17.620 --> 03:18.987
between us this summer.

03:19.021 --> 03:20.555
Big boys rule the camp?

03:20.589 --> 03:22.691
♪ Yeah, big boys rule the ca... ♪

03:23.926 --> 03:26.995
I'm part of a class-action lawsuit.

03:29.532 --> 03:31.399
You all laughed at me,

03:31.434 --> 03:34.436
but I told you we needed
five newspaper subscriptions.

03:34.470 --> 03:35.770
Happy anniversary, babe!

03:35.805 --> 03:38.540
Oh, yeah, congratulations, you two!

03:38.574 --> 03:40.075
Which anniversary is it?

03:40.109 --> 03:42.377
Is it one?

03:42.411 --> 03:43.978
Is it two?

03:44.013 --> 03:46.247
Is it 69?

03:47.583 --> 03:49.117
Well executed, Jeff.

03:49.151 --> 03:52.053
You just earned yourself
one month of <i>USA Today.</i>

03:52.088 --> 03:54.289
Anyway, we're gonna celebrate
by heading out to Burning Man.

03:54.323 --> 03:56.725
I used to burn. Got too corporate.

03:56.759 --> 03:58.960
Now you gotta poo in designated areas.

03:58.994 --> 04:01.463
Anyhoo, how'd you get tickets?
I hear it's hard now.

04:01.497 --> 04:03.298
Uh...

04:03.332 --> 04:05.233
You didn't get tickets?

04:05.267 --> 04:07.268
You told me you were taking care of it!

04:07.303 --> 04:08.970
"I got it covered, babe."

04:09.004 --> 04:11.072
Hey, don't get on the naggin' wagon <i>now.</i>

04:11.107 --> 04:13.308
Could've used that when
I forgot to get tickets!

04:13.342 --> 04:15.944
Ugh! Way to ruin our anniversary!

04:15.978 --> 04:18.846
69 years down the drain.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.426
_

04:21.427 --> 04:24.296
...which is how this
camp came to be built

04:24.330 --> 04:27.868
on an ancient Indian burial ground.

04:27.903 --> 04:28.400
Which tribe?

04:28.434 --> 04:31.236
The, uh... Whatever, kid.
They were friggin' Indians.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.840
And some say their zombie
chief still haunts the camp.

04:36.289 --> 04:38.490
Whoa, whoa, Steve! What's going on?

04:38.524 --> 04:41.293
Just telling the Lil' Apaches here
the legend of the camp.

04:41.327 --> 04:44.963
It's a great "dead" -time story.

04:47.366 --> 04:49.234
Okay, maybe that's not a good idea.

04:49.268 --> 04:51.002
If you get 'em all riled up,

04:51.037 --> 04:52.337
<i>I'm</i> the one that has to read 'em

04:52.371 --> 04:54.239
an extra chapter of "Super Fudge".

04:54.273 --> 04:55.907
I thought this C.I.T. stuff

04:55.942 --> 04:57.409
wasn't going to change us having fun.

04:57.443 --> 04:59.010
It's not!

04:59.045 --> 05:01.980
Look, let's hang at the rope
swing tomorrow after lunch,

05:02.014 --> 05:03.248
just you and me.

05:03.282 --> 05:04.683
What about them?

05:04.717 --> 05:06.051
They'll be writing letters home

05:06.085 --> 05:09.354
and playing with the
iPads they smuggle in.

05:09.388 --> 05:10.355
Right, guys?

05:10.389 --> 05:12.057
We don't <i>all</i> have iPads.

05:13.726 --> 05:16.361
My Etch-a-Sketch can do
something your iPad can't.

05:21.165 --> 05:23.535
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

05:25.071 --> 05:27.339
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

05:28.841 --> 05:30.842
Since you couldn't go to Burning Man,

05:30.877 --> 05:33.311
I brought Burning Man to <i>you!</i>

05:33.346 --> 05:37.082
I'm giving you two the
best anniversary ever.

05:37.116 --> 05:38.817
And tearing up my lawn!

05:38.851 --> 05:40.385
It's a Burn, Stan.

05:40.419 --> 05:43.021
The only limit...

05:43.055 --> 05:44.656
is your mind.

05:46.592 --> 05:48.160
And the property line.

05:50.563 --> 05:52.697
I can't believe Snot stood me up.

05:52.732 --> 05:55.534
I've wasted the whole day
flawlessly skipping stones.

05:55.568 --> 05:58.570
Oh, no! It's the man from
the other side of the lake!

05:58.604 --> 06:00.238
Are these yours?!

06:00.273 --> 06:04.242
Your stone hit me and my wife
while we were making love!

06:04.277 --> 06:06.211
You were alone over there.

06:06.245 --> 06:08.280
That is one narrative!

06:08.314 --> 06:10.782
_

06:10.816 --> 06:12.484
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>

06:12.518 --> 06:14.619
<i>I always wanted to be a counselor.</i>

06:14.654 --> 06:18.723
Hey, what do you call 50 townies
at the bottom of a rockslide?

06:18.758 --> 06:20.248
A good start!

06:21.894 --> 06:24.629
Good one, Chief! Get you another Sprite?

06:24.664 --> 06:27.532
I don't know, Snot.
Do townies eat their own shit?

06:31.671 --> 06:33.071
<i>To me, being a counselor</i>

06:33.105 --> 06:36.041
was better than being
president <i>of the United States.</i>

06:36.075 --> 06:40.312
<i>It meant being a somebody
in a town full of nobodies.</i>

06:40.346 --> 06:42.080
You guys get Sprite?!

06:42.114 --> 06:46.384
Camper Steve? What are you
doing in the counselor cabin?!

06:46.419 --> 06:49.454
I'm sorry, Chief.
Just a little misunderstanding.

06:49.488 --> 06:52.857
Do you have any idea how long I
was waiting out there for you?

06:52.892 --> 06:53.799
I'm sorry.

06:53.799 --> 06:55.894
What happened to us having fun together?

06:55.928 --> 06:58.063
- I have responsibilities now,
- _

06:58.097 --> 06:59.297
grown-up stuff.

06:59.332 --> 07:00.832
That are more important than me?

07:00.866 --> 07:01.900
Yes!

07:01.934 --> 07:04.569
I mean... sometimes.

07:04.604 --> 07:05.570
Yes.

07:05.605 --> 07:07.739
Oh. Okay.

07:07.773 --> 07:08.940
Look, Steve...

07:08.975 --> 07:09.975
Apology accepted.

07:10.009 --> 07:11.576
I wasn't apologizing.

07:11.611 --> 07:15.280
I was just gonna say
it's bedtime for you.

07:16.882 --> 07:18.250
What a dick.

07:18.284 --> 07:20.619
- I'm still here.
- I wasn't talking to you.

07:22.755 --> 07:26.358
This guy was talking to this guy
about how much of a dick he is.

07:26.392 --> 07:28.593
I'm tired of you guys
fighting all the time.

07:28.628 --> 07:31.096
You want to make up in my mouth?

07:33.599 --> 07:37.168
This, Smith. This is why
no one wants to canoe with you.

07:39.070 --> 07:40.070
_

07:41.071 --> 07:43.573
Hey, guys! How was arts and crafts?

07:43.607 --> 07:45.575
You make some cool dreamcatchers?

07:46.844 --> 07:48.611
Great! Great!

07:48.645 --> 07:52.315
I've just been finding all
the candy you hid in here!

07:52.349 --> 07:55.118
In your pillowcases,
under your mattresses.

07:55.152 --> 07:59.722
And, guys, come on.
I know "Todd" isn't a real camper.

07:59.757 --> 08:02.291
He's just a bunch of
Starburst mushed together

08:02.326 --> 08:03.960
wearing Noah's clothes.

08:03.994 --> 08:06.496
Didn't <i>you</i> used to
sneak candy into camp?

08:06.530 --> 08:08.464
Yeah, when I was a kid.

08:08.499 --> 08:10.800
Now you're looking at a grown-ass man.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.135
Do you see this?

08:12.169 --> 08:15.505
This is what a grown-ass man looks like.

08:15.539 --> 08:17.306
You are all missing swimming.

08:17.341 --> 08:18.841
And if I find this stuff again,

08:18.876 --> 08:20.643
I'm gonna make you smell these Air Walks

08:20.677 --> 08:23.880
I've been wearing all
summer without socks.

08:23.914 --> 08:27.016
Snot's not letting you
have any fun, huh?

08:27.050 --> 08:28.584
Well, I'm here to change that.

08:36.426 --> 08:37.994
That's a lot of powdered sugar.

08:42.131 --> 08:43.765
What is happening?

08:45.702 --> 08:47.069
What is happening is...

08:48.639 --> 08:49.438
...is I'm...

08:53.143 --> 08:54.944
Mm! Whew!

08:54.978 --> 08:57.413
I'm here to invite you
guys on a panty raid.

08:57.447 --> 08:59.282
Won't that get us in <i>more</i> trouble?

08:59.316 --> 09:01.584
Listen, I came here to have fun!

09:01.618 --> 09:03.853
This time tomorrow,
we could all be knee-deep

09:03.887 --> 09:06.989
in stolen Disney princess Underoos!

09:07.024 --> 09:07.990
- Yes!
- Yeah!

09:08.025 --> 09:09.759
- Whoo!
- Let's do it!

09:09.793 --> 09:12.094
Still doesn't change the
fact that I'm wetting my bed

09:12.129 --> 09:15.298
because I'm homesick for Mommy.

09:22.239 --> 09:24.006
Hello, my lovelies.

09:24.041 --> 09:27.243
I have playa gifts for you.

09:27.277 --> 09:29.512
Anniversary necklaces.

09:29.546 --> 09:31.881
Together, they symbolize your love.

09:31.915 --> 09:35.084
Wow! Roger, these are beautiful!

09:35.118 --> 09:36.853
Did you make them yourself?

09:36.887 --> 09:38.387
I went to Target myself.

09:38.422 --> 09:40.957
I told you,
I want this to be special for you.

09:40.991 --> 09:43.092
Later, I'm cooking you a gourmet meal.

09:43.126 --> 09:45.094
Plus, I made you a sheet of acid.

09:45.128 --> 09:47.396
Each tab features a little alien saying,

09:47.431 --> 09:48.965
"Take me to your dealer."

09:49.509 --> 09:50.600
They usually say "leader,"

09:50.634 --> 09:53.035
but this alien likes drugs.

09:55.439 --> 09:57.740
This is <i>so</i> thoughtful.

09:57.774 --> 09:59.842
This whole thing, it's just...

09:59.877 --> 10:01.310
too thoughtful.

10:01.345 --> 10:03.913
When has Roger ever done
anything just to be nice?

10:03.947 --> 10:05.147
He always has an ulterior motive.

10:05.182 --> 10:07.016
Dude, that's true.

10:07.050 --> 10:10.119
Maybe these psychedelics
will help us see through his plan.

10:10.153 --> 10:13.122
Jeff, no! Look,
until we figure out what Roger's up to,

10:13.156 --> 10:15.725
we should do nothing, trust nothing...

10:15.759 --> 10:17.126
take nothing.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.729
Can I take a Benadryl
if I get stung by a bee?

10:19.763 --> 10:21.430
Yes, Jeff, you can take that.

10:21.465 --> 10:23.466
What about Roger's homemade Benadryl?

10:23.500 --> 10:25.268
It's good that you're
asking me about these things.

10:25.302 --> 10:26.769
No.

10:30.674 --> 10:32.475
What's that horrible music?

10:32.509 --> 10:33.843
It's called dubstep.

10:33.877 --> 10:36.846
It's the sound of living
in your parents' basement forever.

10:38.482 --> 10:40.850
Why are you being so uptight, Stan?

10:40.884 --> 10:42.418
Come hula-hoop with me!

10:42.452 --> 10:44.320
Is there another one?!

10:52.562 --> 10:54.964
Oh, no! Roger's acid!

10:54.998 --> 10:58.634
Each of these things can make
a full-grown man trip balls!

10:58.669 --> 11:02.338
Imagine what they'll do
to a four-ounce goldfish!

11:04.107 --> 11:06.175
...cracker?

11:06.209 --> 11:08.144
I think I'm "crackering" up!

11:12.869 --> 11:14.383
They're all here!

11:14.418 --> 11:16.986
Milanos, Chessmen...

11:17.020 --> 11:18.254
Pretzel Thins.

11:19.489 --> 11:21.624
Congratulations, Klaus.

11:21.658 --> 11:24.060
You're high as shit.

11:29.533 --> 11:32.168
Okay, guys,
I did a little panty raid recon

11:32.202 --> 11:33.536
on the girls' cabin.

11:33.570 --> 11:35.638
Actually,
we're not doing the panty raid.

11:35.672 --> 11:36.672
W-Why not?!

11:36.707 --> 11:39.308
Well, we talked about it,
and we get the sense

11:39.343 --> 11:41.510
that you're a pretty nerdy 14-year-old.

11:41.545 --> 11:43.879
But us, we're pretty cool 10-year-olds.

11:43.914 --> 11:46.549
I've kissed three girls this summer.

11:46.583 --> 11:50.419
So, we're feeling like we should
avoid anything that you do.

11:51.555 --> 11:54.023
Okay, first of all, Paul?

11:54.057 --> 11:55.358
[Bleep] you.

11:57.961 --> 12:00.062
Whoa! Cool bed!

12:00.097 --> 12:02.398
I stress-tested this baby to four tons,

12:02.432 --> 12:04.233
so feel free to pound it out.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.268
Again, very thoughtful.

12:06.303 --> 12:07.803
The food looks delicious, too.

12:07.838 --> 12:10.239
Good... so you'll eat,
then get nice and tired

12:10.273 --> 12:12.274
and sleep like the dead.

12:12.309 --> 12:14.710
What's that? It looks like... blood.

12:15.099 --> 12:16.245
Must be mine.

12:16.279 --> 12:18.414
I mean, who else's would it be?

12:19.716 --> 12:21.317
Nope. One of those cocker spaniels

12:21.351 --> 12:23.019
must've had their period in here.

12:23.053 --> 12:25.521
Okay, you two, eat and sleep time!

12:32.763 --> 12:34.430
Oh, this is awesome!

12:34.464 --> 12:36.065
You guys should've seen
the Lil' Apaches.

12:36.099 --> 12:39.035
They were all like,
"Can we please come with you, Steve?

12:39.069 --> 12:41.103
None of us have even kissed a girl."

12:41.138 --> 12:44.140
I heard Paul is plowing
his way through Cabin 7.

12:44.174 --> 12:47.710
The point is I told them
if I'ma do a panty raid,

12:47.744 --> 12:49.578
I'ma do it with my O.G.s...

12:49.613 --> 12:52.782
the younger, sleepier Mini Mohawks.

12:52.816 --> 12:54.550
This doesn't feel fun,

12:54.584 --> 12:56.218
what you're doing right now.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.987
It feels more desperate.

12:58.021 --> 12:59.622
Desperate how?!

12:59.656 --> 13:02.324
Okay, so... we're gonna bounce.

13:02.359 --> 13:04.427
Just 'cause we're leaving

13:04.461 --> 13:07.763
doesn't mean we don't
want you to get better.

13:12.402 --> 13:13.669
Hey! Where's your glow?

13:13.831 --> 13:15.304
Darktards!

13:17.074 --> 13:19.375
All right, we need to figure
out what Roger is up to.

13:19.409 --> 13:21.143
Klaus, are you okay?

13:21.178 --> 13:23.446
Oh, yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.880
I was just gonna cut my face off

13:24.915 --> 13:27.116
to let the shadow
people out of my skull.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.751
So, the burritos are up for grabs?

13:28.785 --> 13:32.021
Burritos?! I'm <i>marrying</i>
this young couple.

13:36.393 --> 13:38.761
All right, I think I got something.

13:38.795 --> 13:40.830
Roger wrote down a phone number.

13:40.864 --> 13:44.333
Reverse lookup says it's a
medical clinic in El Salvador.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.168
Hey, does this mean anything?

13:50.007 --> 13:52.007
_

13:52.008 --> 13:53.442
Holy crap!

13:53.477 --> 13:55.444
Roger set this whole thing
up to take our organs!

13:55.479 --> 13:57.146
Roger's evil!

13:57.180 --> 13:59.682
But you gotta give him a
little credit for being so...

13:59.716 --> 14:02.151
organ... ized.

14:03.153 --> 14:05.354
There's that smile.

14:07.891 --> 14:10.326
Bunch of 8-year-olds calling me nerdy.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.862
Bunch of 6-year-olds
calling me desperate.

14:12.896 --> 14:14.497
I don't need any of 'em.

14:14.531 --> 14:16.031
- Snot?
- Gotcha.

14:16.066 --> 14:18.868
Don't you mean "Gotye"? 'Cause you're...

14:18.902 --> 14:22.104
♪ Somebody that I used to know ♪

14:22.139 --> 14:25.541
"American Dad" remembers Gotye.

14:25.575 --> 14:26.942
I can't let you do this.

14:26.977 --> 14:28.878
Sure you can! You can do it <i>with</i> me!

14:28.912 --> 14:30.846
You don't think I wanna have fun?

14:30.881 --> 14:33.816
But if I have fun,
sunscreen is not applied,

14:33.850 --> 14:35.851
friendship bracelets are poorly woven,

14:35.886 --> 14:39.655
and no one scratches Chief
Danny's bug bites to completion!

14:39.689 --> 14:42.925
You know what? Forget it!
I got panties to try on...

14:42.959 --> 14:44.660
Raid! To raid.

14:44.694 --> 14:46.162
Stop, Steve, or I'll...

14:46.196 --> 14:48.464
What? Blow your corked whistle?

14:51.067 --> 14:53.202
You wouldn't dare.

14:56.940 --> 14:59.441
C.I.T. Snot, you uncorked your whistle.

14:59.476 --> 15:01.076
This better be good.

15:01.111 --> 15:04.246
Camper Steve was about
to commit... a panty raid.

15:04.281 --> 15:07.016
By himself? That's kind of a bummer.

15:07.050 --> 15:10.419
And also a clear violation
of our no-bullying policy.

15:10.453 --> 15:11.587
I gotta send ya home.

15:11.621 --> 15:12.655
What?!

15:12.689 --> 15:13.989
I will, however, allow you

15:14.024 --> 15:16.926
to sing "Boom Chicka Boom"
one last time.

15:16.960 --> 15:17.954
But I...

15:17.954 --> 15:19.995
♪ I said a-boom chicka-boom ♪

15:20.030 --> 15:22.064
♪ I said a-boom chicka-boom ♪

15:39.016 --> 15:40.150
Gimme a Sprite.

15:40.184 --> 15:41.985
Get the hell out of my bar.

15:42.019 --> 15:44.955
Don't tell me...
Sprite's only for counselors.

15:46.224 --> 15:48.959
There's two things we
don't like in this town...

15:48.993 --> 15:51.862
that lousy summer camp and Sprite.

15:51.896 --> 15:55.365
So, you can do the Dew,
or you can be on your way.

15:55.399 --> 15:57.801
You don't have to tell
<i>me</i> that camp sucks.

15:57.835 --> 15:59.069
It double-sucks.

15:59.103 --> 16:02.372
Hey, everybody, this kid's
making a lot of sense over here.

16:02.406 --> 16:03.373
What'd he say, Meaux?

16:03.407 --> 16:07.310
He said that camp,
and I quote, "double-sucks."

16:07.345 --> 16:08.708
Whoa!

16:09.013 --> 16:12.182
I never had the balls to push
it that far, but he's right.

16:12.216 --> 16:14.150
They drive straight through our town

16:14.185 --> 16:15.785
to drop their bratty kids off.

16:15.820 --> 16:18.188
Never once stopping by to
see what the mill's like.

16:18.222 --> 16:19.990
It's really cool in there.

16:20.024 --> 16:21.324
I bet it is.

16:21.359 --> 16:22.993
That dumb camp kicked me out

16:23.027 --> 16:24.895
'cause I wouldn't play by their rules.

16:24.929 --> 16:28.031
Now my life is garbage,
just like you guys.

16:28.065 --> 16:29.866
- Yeah!
- This kid gets us.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.868
Ah, I wish there were some way

16:31.903 --> 16:33.703
we could help ya get
back at that camp...

16:33.738 --> 16:35.205
you know, since you're one of us.

16:35.239 --> 16:37.007
We could give him a tour of the mill.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.308
It's really cool in there.

16:38.342 --> 16:40.143
Yes. Maybe not today,

16:40.177 --> 16:42.479
but let's definitely
get that on the books.

16:42.513 --> 16:45.248
In the meantime,
I know just how you guys

16:45.283 --> 16:46.750
can help me get back at that camp.

16:46.784 --> 16:48.351
But before we get to that,

16:48.386 --> 16:51.721
which sushi roll would you recommend?

16:57.895 --> 16:59.930
Hayley.

16:59.964 --> 17:01.698
Jeff.

17:01.732 --> 17:03.300
Watermelon.

17:03.334 --> 17:04.601
Aha! Busted!

17:04.635 --> 17:06.236
Wait, what are you... Did you not sleep

17:06.270 --> 17:08.538
in the beautiful bed I
put together for you?

17:08.573 --> 17:12.041
Nope, we've avoided everything
you've done for us this weekend

17:12.076 --> 17:14.743
because we know you're
harvesting organs!

17:14.779 --> 17:16.413
That cooler is probably full of 'em.

17:17.213 --> 17:19.482
This cooler... is filled...

17:19.517 --> 17:23.019
with fresh smoked salmon
for your breakfast in bed!

17:24.989 --> 17:29.793
Man! For once in my life, I do something
with absolutely no ulterior motive

17:29.827 --> 17:32.963
'cause, "Oh, it's supposed
to make you feel <i>so</i> good!"

17:32.997 --> 17:33.964
Never again!

17:33.998 --> 17:36.199
So what's with the operating
room in your attic?

17:36.233 --> 17:38.602
I was harvesting my <i>own</i> organs!

17:40.104 --> 17:42.405
How do you think I was
planning to pay for all this?

17:42.440 --> 17:45.108
Unfortunately, there's not much
of a market for alien organs,

17:45.142 --> 17:47.277
so I'm going to have to put 'em back in.

17:47.311 --> 17:49.312
Or maybe not...
I haven't noticed a single difference

17:49.347 --> 17:50.447
since I took them out.

17:50.481 --> 17:51.448
Oh, my God!

17:52.089 --> 17:54.484
♪ Let's all go to the body ♪

17:54.619 --> 17:57.287
♪ Let's all go to the body ♪

17:57.321 --> 18:00.457
♪ Let's all go to the bodyyy ♪

18:00.491 --> 18:02.792
♪ We'll go in through the butt ♪

18:09.667 --> 18:11.601
How long was I out?

18:11.636 --> 18:15.805
Jeff? Did you... take advantage of me?

18:17.041 --> 18:19.442
Looks like the counselors
won't be stopping us,

18:19.477 --> 18:21.845
so let's have us a panty raid!

18:21.879 --> 18:23.480
Look, we're adults.

18:23.514 --> 18:25.315
If we go stealing little kids' panties,

18:25.349 --> 18:28.385
well, that's a list you
don't wanna be on twice.

18:28.419 --> 18:31.154
Raid, raid, raid!

18:31.188 --> 18:34.057
Whoa! You guys are motivated! Wait up!

18:34.091 --> 18:35.692
Steve! What are you doing?!

18:35.726 --> 18:37.594
Me and my <i>new</i> friends from town

18:37.628 --> 18:39.729
are teaching this camp some manners.

18:43.367 --> 18:45.168
It looks more like a riot.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.541
_

18:51.575 --> 18:53.576
_

18:53.611 --> 18:56.079
We're free!

18:56.688 --> 18:59.610
This is gonna be my coffee table!

19:03.120 --> 19:05.488
Uh, guys, m-maybe
we should have a quick pow-wow

19:05.523 --> 19:07.123
to review our objectives here.

19:07.158 --> 19:08.152
You're not our leader.

19:08.152 --> 19:10.293
You're just some kid
that looks like Juno.

19:10.327 --> 19:13.263
Only from certain angles! Now calm down!

19:13.297 --> 19:15.665
You think you can tell us what to do?

19:15.700 --> 19:18.168
You'd... You'd kill me over this?!

19:18.202 --> 19:20.006
Would it please m'lady?

19:20.538 --> 19:22.706
Sorry. I meant "mill lady."

19:26.544 --> 19:27.577
Run, Steve!

19:27.611 --> 19:28.945
Get 'em!

19:40.958 --> 19:43.226
You can't tread water forever!

19:43.260 --> 19:44.794
Yeah, but we can do it for 20 minutes,

19:44.829 --> 19:46.896
or else we wouldn't
have lake privileges!

19:46.931 --> 19:48.898
Townie huddle!

19:48.933 --> 19:50.600
Privileges... 20 minutes...

19:50.634 --> 19:51.835
I know, I know.

19:53.537 --> 19:56.439
Okay! Enjoy your swim party.

19:56.474 --> 19:57.607
We're gonna keep raiding.

20:00.377 --> 20:02.912
Sorry I brought hell into this camp.

20:02.947 --> 20:04.080
I was just mad at you

20:04.115 --> 20:06.483
because you were becoming
a grown-up first,

20:06.517 --> 20:08.885
and it was... changing everything.

20:08.919 --> 20:10.787
No, Steve, I was wrong.

20:10.821 --> 20:14.324
I thought being a grown-up
meant not having fun anymore.

20:14.358 --> 20:15.759
But look at them.

20:15.793 --> 20:17.994
Let me down, you townie scum!

20:18.028 --> 20:19.329
Whoo-hoo!

20:19.363 --> 20:21.131
Best day ever!

20:21.165 --> 20:22.599
They're having a ball!

20:22.633 --> 20:23.833
Exactly.

20:23.868 --> 20:26.302
No matter how grown up we get...

20:26.337 --> 20:28.605
We'll always be able to have fun.

20:28.639 --> 20:30.607
I think he's havin' a heart attack!

20:33.611 --> 20:34.744
Shift change!

20:34.779 --> 20:36.813
Time to get to work, fellas!
