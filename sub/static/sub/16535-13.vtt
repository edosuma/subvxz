00:01.210 --> 00:03.144
Excuse me. You know
where lexi olinsky's room is?

00:03.146 --> 00:04.979
It's right here.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.948
Sergeant. Chief.

00:07.950 --> 00:11.085
Ofi has a conclusion. And?

00:11.087 --> 00:13.821
That fire was intentionally set.

00:13.823 --> 00:15.256
This was mass murder.

00:15.258 --> 00:17.024
Dr. Halstead!

00:18.127 --> 00:19.527
Gentlemen.

00:22.165 --> 00:25.132
Lexi. What's going on?

00:25.134 --> 00:26.200
Do something.

00:26.202 --> 00:27.868
Hey, watch out.
O2 sats are tanking.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.070
She's unable to oxygenate.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.072
Lexi! Hey, lexi! Lexi?
Al, come here. Come here.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.206
Do something. Al? Al.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.642
Hey! Step out.

00:34.644 --> 00:35.776
Do something, man. Lexi!

00:35.778 --> 00:36.944
Al. Lexi!

00:36.946 --> 00:39.647
Al. Please!

00:39.649 --> 00:42.316
Get another blood gas,
drop her tidal volume to 300,

00:42.318 --> 00:44.919
Increase her rate to 25,
and up the peep to 10.

00:44.921 --> 00:47.254
Start paralytics.
50 of atricurium.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.490
Lexi...

00:49.492 --> 00:50.891
It's okay.

00:55.598 --> 00:57.665
Doc, doc, please...
Close that curtain.

00:59.735 --> 01:01.602
Scissors.

01:05.241 --> 01:06.640
Her chest can't expand
to accommodate.

01:06.642 --> 01:07.908
The breath from the vent.

01:07.910 --> 01:09.376
We need to release the skin.
Chest escharotomy?

01:09.378 --> 01:10.644
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.222 --> 01:20.821
Scalpel.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.574
Air pressures are coming down.

01:40.576 --> 01:42.810
Sats are coming up.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.746
All right.

01:45.748 --> 01:47.982
Al.

01:47.984 --> 01:53.454
How's lexi? Is... is she okay?

01:53.456 --> 01:55.122
What? Tell me.

01:55.124 --> 01:57.024
Tell me.

01:57.026 --> 01:59.360
She's in critical condition.

01:59.362 --> 02:02.596
What?
She's in critical condition.

02:05.134 --> 02:09.470
Where is she? Okay, it's okay.

02:09.472 --> 02:12.006
Can I see her?

02:12.008 --> 02:13.607
I need to see her.

02:13.609 --> 02:15.809
Hey, hey. I need to see her.

02:15.811 --> 02:18.179
This is meredith, lexi's mom.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.181
This is dr. Halstead,
jay's brother.

02:20.183 --> 02:23.651
So lexi has burns
over 60% of her body.

02:23.653 --> 02:25.753
What?

02:25.755 --> 02:29.323
We had to make incisions in
the burned area of lexi's chest.

02:29.325 --> 02:32.193
To improve her ability
to breathe.

02:32.195 --> 02:35.629
I'll continue to update you
every step of the way.

02:35.631 --> 02:39.466
And you're going to save her.
Please?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.870
We're gonna do our best.

02:42.872 --> 02:45.706
Let the man do his job.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.576
Come on.

02:48.578 --> 02:50.044
Take a seat.

02:51.614 --> 02:54.181
Hey, take care of her.

02:54.183 --> 02:55.950
You take good care of her.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.525
Hey.

03:08.664 --> 03:11.732
Now you find whoever
set that fire,

03:11.734 --> 03:13.968
And I want him alone.

03:23.679 --> 03:25.546
Detectives
and arson investigators.

03:25.548 --> 03:28.949
From across the city will not
rest until the individual.

03:28.951 --> 03:32.653
Or individuals responsible
are brought to justice.

03:32.655 --> 03:36.123
This cowardly act has robbed
many of our chicago citizens.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.459
Of their future.

03:38.461 --> 03:42.463
I'm being told that
the structure was a home.

03:42.465 --> 03:44.965
To many young
and talented artists.

03:47.637 --> 03:50.271
If those responsible
are watching this,

03:50.273 --> 03:51.939
They're about to feel
the full strength and scope.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.708
Of the chicago
police department.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.176
Any questions?

04:00.149 --> 04:02.449
Stone. Hey.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.051
Antonio.

04:04.053 --> 04:05.352
The entire
state's attorney's office.

04:05.354 --> 04:07.321
And investigators are at
your disposal.

04:07.323 --> 04:09.089
Good. What do you need?

04:09.091 --> 04:10.958
Just have your people
in felony review.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.062
Ready to sign some warrants.
Done.

04:15.064 --> 04:17.798
Hey. I know
detective olinsky's daughter.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.166
Is among the injured.

04:19.168 --> 04:21.435
But when I get this case file,
it's got to be legit,

04:21.437 --> 04:23.771
By the numbers and tight.

04:26.509 --> 04:28.208
Hey, sarge!

04:33.616 --> 04:36.617
Hey, when we responded to
the call, this door was locked...

04:36.619 --> 04:40.087
So we thought...
So we just pried the door open.

04:40.089 --> 04:43.290
And you see these scratches?

04:43.292 --> 04:45.893
Whoever did this
when they exited...

04:45.895 --> 04:48.262
They jammed these metal wedges
underneath the door.

04:53.436 --> 04:55.402
Excuse me a sec. Yeah.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.407
Chief lugo.
We have a task force assembled.

05:00.409 --> 05:03.310
But I want you and intelligence
to run the investigation.

05:03.312 --> 05:05.579
Understood. Right.

05:05.581 --> 05:07.948
Find the son of a bitch
who did this.

05:25.434 --> 05:27.468
I got a relief sergeant
to cover the front desk.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.703
So I'm here to help. Great.

05:29.705 --> 05:33.374
These are our 36 doas.

05:33.376 --> 05:37.010
And the 18 over there
are in the icu at med.

05:41.484 --> 05:44.184
All right, thank you.
All right, hey,

05:44.186 --> 05:46.987
That was a parole officer
in east garfield park.

05:46.989 --> 05:49.156
She has an ex-con
named nathan delano.

05:49.158 --> 05:50.691
Who did 18 years for arson.

05:50.693 --> 05:52.659
And attempted homicide
in stateville.

05:52.661 --> 05:55.763
Because he lit his family
on fire back in 1998.

05:55.765 --> 05:58.232
Including three of
his own children.

05:58.234 --> 06:01.034
So this guy failed
to report in yesterday.

06:01.036 --> 06:02.403
She marked him down
for the violation,

06:02.405 --> 06:05.139
But his last known address
was 4133 south wells.

06:05.141 --> 06:07.508
That's six blocks
from the kimball factory.

06:07.510 --> 06:10.144
There's a active warrant
out for his arrest.

06:10.146 --> 06:12.212
Yeah. Let's go.

06:33.035 --> 06:36.737
Nathan delano? Chicago pd!
Open up!

06:43.570 --> 06:46.839
5021, ida emergency.
Shots fired at the police.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.607
Go to globaltv. Com
now a4133 south ida. With.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.542
Advise responding, there are
plain clothes officers.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.911
On the scene.

06:51.913 --> 06:53.012
Ready, boys?

06:56.250 --> 06:59.985
Hey!

06:59.987 --> 07:01.854
All right.

07:01.856 --> 07:05.024
<i>Many of the victims had only
recently moved to chicago.</i>

07:05.026 --> 07:06.592
<i>Family members
are still arriving.</i>

07:06.594 --> 07:07.860
<i>From around the country,</i>

07:07.862 --> 07:10.362
<i>Heartbroken,
searching for answers.</i>

07:13.834 --> 07:15.467
Son of a bitch.

07:21.943 --> 07:23.742
Stop!

07:27.348 --> 07:30.115
Stay down!

07:30.117 --> 07:31.650
Get off of me.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.953
Pigs! Get off me! Get up.

07:33.955 --> 07:36.989
Get up!

07:36.991 --> 07:39.425
That's not delano.

07:39.427 --> 07:41.894
What's your name?

07:42.897 --> 07:44.363
No, no, no.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.367
What is your problem?

07:50.404 --> 07:52.037
<i>Lane cromwell.</i>

07:52.039 --> 07:53.706
He and nathan delano
were cellmates.

07:53.708 --> 07:56.442
At stateville for four years.

07:56.444 --> 08:00.446
He's wanted on an extraditable
felony warrant from st. Louis.

08:00.448 --> 08:03.382
He beat a cab driver
half to death.

08:03.384 --> 08:07.419
Priors for unlawful restraint,
aggravated battery,

08:07.421 --> 08:09.488
Assaulting a police...
You get the idea.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.763
Yeah, I'm gonna
head back upstairs.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.865
That's probably a good idea.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.603
You spit on that floor again,
you're gonna be.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.973
Licking it back up, trust me.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.082
Nathan delano. Where is he?

08:38.085 --> 08:40.519
I know you know who I am.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.288
I know I'm going back to prison
for the rest of my life.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.024
So save it.

08:45.026 --> 08:47.593
You got nothing to offer me.

08:47.595 --> 08:51.463
That's a fair point.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.766
Fair point.

08:53.768 --> 08:56.402
But your little brother...
What's his name again?

08:56.404 --> 08:57.936
Aaron.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.540
He's doing six years
at menard, isn't that right?

09:01.542 --> 09:04.076
Yeah, it says here he's in,

09:04.078 --> 09:05.811
Administrative segregation.

09:05.813 --> 09:09.281
Apparently he's having some
problems in gen pop.

09:09.283 --> 09:12.017
I don't know, but,

09:12.019 --> 09:15.521
Judging by his intake photo,
I'm guessing he's just...

09:15.523 --> 09:17.523
Just a little too fetching.

09:20.261 --> 09:21.326
You can't touch him.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.594
No? No.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.663
You wanna hear something
really funny?

09:24.665 --> 09:28.600
The warden at menard
used to be my deputy chief.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.736
Yeah.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.105
See, his wife, she wanted
to move out to the country,

09:33.107 --> 09:35.441
So he took the warden gig.

09:35.443 --> 09:39.878
And she finally got her garden.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.015
So I'd say inside of 30 minutes,
I could have your baby brother.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.618
Tossed in that yard
like a little dog treat.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.594
I don't know where nathan is.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.166
He packed a bag real quick
and drove off.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.103
Two minutes before
your cop buddies rolled up.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.971
Did he torch that warehouse?

10:07.508 --> 10:10.042
Did he torch that warehouse?

10:12.780 --> 10:16.515
I have no idea.
I wasn't there and I didn't ask.

10:16.517 --> 10:17.983
So why'd he blow off
his check-in.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.286
With his parole officer
yesterday?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.621
He'd been using.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.356
He knew he wouldn't
pass the piss test,

10:24.358 --> 10:28.193
So we were gonna skip town.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.263
Head up to alaska, where a buddy
of mine owns a fishing boat.

10:31.265 --> 10:35.167
Okay, what's he driving?

10:35.169 --> 10:37.236
What's he driving?

10:42.009 --> 10:45.911
Suit yourself.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.980
A '94 green toyota.

10:51.252 --> 10:53.285
Stolen out of wisconsin.

11:05.199 --> 11:07.266
Copy that. Thanks. Okay, sarge,

11:07.268 --> 11:09.301
We got a statewide bolo
out there on delano.

11:09.303 --> 11:10.736
And the stolen toyota.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.304
So here's what
we're up against, boss.

11:12.306 --> 11:14.706
The warehouse was without
any residential permits,

11:14.708 --> 11:16.808
So there's no records,
no lease agreements,

11:16.810 --> 11:19.278
No video cameras and the person
who knew the most.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.547
Was the owner, barry kimball,
who shot himself in the face.

11:21.549 --> 11:23.215
Yesterday at firehouse 51.

11:23.217 --> 11:25.484
Right, delano's previous
arson, he tried to kill.

11:25.486 --> 11:26.919
His own family members.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.820
So it's a good bet if he's
behind this one,

11:28.822 --> 11:31.590
He has some personal connection
to someone inside.

11:31.592 --> 11:34.326
Hey, this is interesting.
Barry kimball.

11:34.328 --> 11:36.728
Took out additional commercial
property insurance.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.630
On the warehouse six months ago.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.265
He doubled his policy.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.633
Insurance scam?

11:41.635 --> 11:43.502
Somehow crosses paths
with delano.

11:43.504 --> 11:45.170
And then gets him
to torch the place.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.506
It says he has a live-in
girlfriend, stacia mulaney.

11:47.508 --> 11:49.741
We can check his apartment.
Do it.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.114
She almost came home.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.918
We had lunch last week.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.922
I said, you know,
you've given this guy two years.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.693
It's time, you know,
to pursue your own dreams.

12:09.296 --> 12:14.099
And so I went back that next day.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.970
And she had her bag packed.

12:19.707 --> 12:25.177
So I opened the car door but,

12:25.179 --> 12:26.612
She just shook her head.

12:26.614 --> 12:28.847
She was crying.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.885
You know,
she couldn't leave him.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.557
"He needs me, dad."

12:44.832 --> 12:46.431
This is a nightmare.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.467
Yeah, for a lot of people.

12:48.469 --> 12:50.402
Barry was just trying to help.

12:50.404 --> 12:51.737
They were artists and musicians.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.238
Who couldn't afford
regular rent.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.073
You know, they made
a community there.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.442
Do either of these men
look familiar to you?

12:59.913 --> 13:01.880
No.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.949
Why did barry take out
extra insurance on the warehouse.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.852
Six months ago? I don't know.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.887
He kept me out of that stuff.

13:11.292 --> 13:12.591
When he killed himself
at the firehouse,

13:12.593 --> 13:13.992
He had an unregistered gun.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.594
Why would he be
walking around with that?

13:15.596 --> 13:17.429
He was being threatened.

13:17.431 --> 13:18.964
By who? He didn't say,

13:18.966 --> 13:21.199
But he started to get
really paranoid.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.901
Threatened about what?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.903
Money. I don't know.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.339
Like I said, barry kept me out
of all of that stuff.

13:27.341 --> 13:30.509
Okay, stacia, I'm gonna
ask you something.

13:30.511 --> 13:33.445
And I'm only gonna ask once.

13:33.447 --> 13:35.714
Do you know who was
after your boyfriend.

13:35.716 --> 13:38.684
Or who could have
started that fire?

13:38.686 --> 13:40.218
No.

13:43.057 --> 13:45.057
Okay.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.992
Keep your phone on.
Don't leave town.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.896
We'll be in touch.

13:52.466 --> 13:56.768
Right.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.338
I got a hit.

13:59.340 --> 14:01.640
I ran the wisconsin plate
on delano's stolen toyota.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.208
Through nvls plate reader.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.743
And got two consecutive hits,

14:04.745 --> 14:07.446
Both indicating
the 3400 block of pulaski.

14:07.448 --> 14:09.114
All right, lindsay and
halstead should be right there.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.682
Have them respond. Yeah.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.097
Here.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.416
Get out of the way!

14:53.360 --> 14:55.427
Stop, police!

15:02.536 --> 15:04.102
5021 george.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.904
Armed offender fleeing westbound
on 29th street.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.006
Get me some cars!

15:08.008 --> 15:09.908
Out of the way!

15:12.746 --> 15:15.347
Do not move!

15:15.349 --> 15:16.882
Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

15:16.884 --> 15:17.916
Let it go!

15:17.918 --> 15:19.885
5021 george. Shots fired
by the police.

15:19.887 --> 15:22.821
Offender is down.
4000 block of west 29th street.

15:22.823 --> 15:25.791
Roll an ambulance.

15:25.793 --> 15:28.360
5021 george's other half...
Can you tell that ambulance.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.095
To kick it in the ass, please?

15:30.097 --> 15:32.197
Hey, partner, are you all right?

15:32.199 --> 15:33.432
<i>Jay, are you there?</i>

15:33.434 --> 15:35.267
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:35.269 --> 15:38.570
<i>5021, squad be advised...
You're gonna be okay.</i>

15:38.572 --> 15:39.704
Offender didn't make it.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.773
<i>Copy that, 5021 george.
We'll notify coroner.</i>

15:48.781 --> 15:50.582
Hey. I got something.

15:50.584 --> 15:52.350
<i>Keep your day out of your night.
We were able to pull some video.</i>

15:52.352 --> 15:56.888
Off one of the phones
recovered from the warehouse.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.607
Okay, back it up.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.614
That guy was leaving fast.

16:22.616 --> 16:24.482
Stop.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.618
Zoom in.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.188
That's our killer.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.992
Yep.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.601
We're up to 38.

16:43.603 --> 16:48.306
So based on the proximity of
the suspect to the stairs...

16:48.308 --> 16:49.741
Which we measured
at the warehouse...

16:49.743 --> 16:52.510
He should be about 5'9,
figure 150 pounds.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.212
And how tall was delano?

16:54.214 --> 16:58.516
Delano was
a little over six feet.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.021
Hey, guys, um,
so there's gonna be.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.223
A candlelight vigil tonight
at the warehouse.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.326
At 8:00, fyi.

17:08.328 --> 17:12.864
So the block
the warehouse is on.

17:12.866 --> 17:16.300
Strings signify security cameras
from private companies.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.835
And what angles they access.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.038
All right, I want footage
going back one month.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.839
And I want access
to all these cameras.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.174
All right.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.376
Hey, it's my c.I.
I'll be right back.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.016
What's up, man?
What you got for me?

17:32.018 --> 17:33.084
Yeah, man, you know
the dude who owned.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.752
The warehouse, kimball? Yeah.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.487
You know, we know each other
'cause I used to supply.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.056
Some folks who live
in the warehouse.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.490
Right, right, right.
I understand that, rashad.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.625
That's why I called you.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.962
Well, he hit me up
a couple weeks ago.

17:43.964 --> 17:45.997
Wanted me to take care
of a situation for him.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.765
You know, turns out,
these dudes were trying.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.233
To shake him for some money.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.601
Wanted me to step in, intervene,

17:50.603 --> 17:52.437
You know, do my thing.
Okay, wait, wait.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.571
When did I ask you
for information.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.140
About the warehouse, rashad?
This morning.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.009
Honestly, I think somewhere
down the line,

17:58.011 --> 17:59.510
A miscommunication developed
between us.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.945
And I take full responsibility
for that.

18:00.947 --> 18:04.415
I get it. But I'ma clarify
for you right now.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.184
We in business, together.
You work for me.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.685
You understand that?
You give me information,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.654
I give you cash and keep your
ass out of jail.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.122
Yes or no? Yes.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.724
Of course.

18:12.726 --> 18:16.027
Thirty-eight people died,
rashad.

18:16.029 --> 18:19.263
You can't slow walk this to me
six hours later, bro.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.065
I swear on everything I love,
if that happens again,

18:21.067 --> 18:23.101
Your life is gonna change.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.537
Do you copy me? Copy.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.506
Now, you were saying.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.640
Look, this dude named k.D.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.975
Was trying to
shake kimball down, man.

18:30.977 --> 18:31.976
That's all he told me.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.811
I never saw the dude.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.747
Just told me to be ready.

18:35.749 --> 18:38.483
He might about to put the ball
in k.D.'s court.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.655
She's bradying down.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.724
Milligram of atropine.

18:52.132 --> 18:56.067
It's not working.
Get one of epi.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.869
Heart rate, 20.
She's a peri-arrest.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.151
Stats are down to single digits.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.206
I can't get a pulse. Asystole!

19:02.208 --> 19:04.308
Get on her chest. Start cpr.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.543
Another dose of epi, now.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.702
I'll be right back.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.246
Will.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.881
Now, I've had to give
a lot of notifications.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.751
To family over the years,
so I know how hard it is.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.287
So you don't have to sugar coat
anything for me.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.823
All right?

19:51.825 --> 19:56.060
Okay, so...

19:56.062 --> 19:57.995
Is lexi gonna make it?

20:01.835 --> 20:04.535
Her heart already stopped.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.572
And, we were able
to get it going again.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.274
She's in multi-organ failure.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.044
There's just nothing more
we can do.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.581
I'm so sorry, al.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.688
Lexi died 20 minutes ago.

21:34.360 --> 21:38.696
We can mourn when the scumbag
who did this is in cuffs.

21:41.935 --> 21:47.305
Till then, what do we got?

21:47.307 --> 21:49.607
Yeah.

21:49.609 --> 21:53.611
Right... um...

21:53.613 --> 21:54.979
The lab did an enhancement.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.949
On the suspect
leaving the warehouse.

21:57.951 --> 22:00.752
They were able
to identify the logo.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.121
On the right shoulder
of the suspect's jacket.

22:03.123 --> 22:06.390
The brand is forerange.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.360
The cargo jacket looks like
the one the suspect is wearing.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.966
There's five retail stores
in chicago that carry the brand.

22:14.968 --> 22:17.435
They're sending me the last six
months of security footage.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.738
And all their cash and their
credit card transactions.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.014
All right, kev, what's up with
the tip you got on k.D.?

22:30.016 --> 22:34.085
Yeah, we got
85 registered gang bangers.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.920
With those initials
in our database.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.356
And I cross-referenced
the initials k.D.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.591
With everyone who's contacted
kimball's phone.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.759
Nothing.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.895
These are all
in-service calls and any paper.

22:43.897 --> 22:45.963
Generated on the warehouse.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.566
Most of the calls came from
the same landline.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.636
Same woman. Claire burke.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.472
She's made over 40 suspicious
persons calls.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.542
The last was three nights ago
and she lives.

22:57.544 --> 23:01.112
Down the block
from the warehouse.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.781
So you and jay.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.775
This is how it always happens.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.612
Y'all don't show up
until it hits the fan.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.714
Detectives lindsay and halstead.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.349
Are you claire burke? Yes.

24:11.351 --> 24:12.717
And before you leave,
I wanna get.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.353
The correct spelling of your
names, your badge numbers,

24:15.355 --> 24:17.188
And what unit
you're assigned to.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.256
Not a problem, ma'am.

24:18.258 --> 24:20.291
We're here about
the warehouse fire.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.393
The gentleman who owned it
was named barry...

24:22.395 --> 24:23.661
I know who he is.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.463
And he packed them damn kids
in there like sardines.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.731
Treated them about as good, too.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.165
Did you notice anything
the night of the fire?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.534
Anything suspicious?
The night before, I did.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.736
Okay. Barry had been having.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.404
This heated conversation
with another man,

24:33.406 --> 24:35.339
Right down the street.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.575
I was sitting in that window,
and I could see it all.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.378
This man kept thumping
barry's chest like this.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.280
And I told that old hair bag
officer keating.

24:42.282 --> 24:44.982
When he finally showed up
45 minutes later.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.951
But did officer keating
follow up with me?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.552
Hell no.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.488
Okay, any other details
about the man?

24:50.490 --> 24:52.056
White gentleman. Brown hair.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.491
A little shorter than you,
looked like...

24:53.493 --> 24:54.492
How much shorter?

24:54.494 --> 24:56.727
So you interrupt people.

24:56.729 --> 24:57.962
Sorry, ma'am. I didn't have.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.797
A measuring stick,
so I can't say for sure.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.032
But he was in his 20s, though.

25:01.034 --> 25:02.300
And I got
his license plate number.

25:02.302 --> 25:03.601
Wrote it down. Really?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.136
Any chance you have
security cameras?

25:05.138 --> 25:06.537
What am I? Fort knox?
No, I don't have.

25:06.539 --> 25:07.605
Any damn security cameras.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.806
But I got eyeballs.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.840
And that guy had been by here.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.776
Three times to talk to barry.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.210
He was bringing
nothing but bad news.

25:13.212 --> 25:16.480
Next thing you know,
39 young people get called home.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.549
Way before their time.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.087
I'll go get you
that license plate number.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.455
Appreciate it.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.860
Boss, ran the plate.
Came back to a kade davis.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.228
Kade davis? Yeah.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.165
26 years old, 5'8, 170 pounds.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.633
No criminal history, though.

25:35.635 --> 25:39.303
Get a photo array together.
All right.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.272
Him. No doubt in my mind.

25:41.274 --> 25:44.241
Thank you very much
for your help.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.711
Finally, a cop does something
in this city.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.082
Lock him into the area,

25:51.084 --> 25:53.784
Dump his phone, run his vehicle.

25:53.786 --> 25:57.088
I want everything on this prick
before we move on him.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.827
Al.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.269
We're so sorry.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.205
Thanks.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.342
Well, listen.
Let's get you home.

26:18.344 --> 26:22.179
Be with meredith. No.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.984
Alvin, do you wanna
get some coffee?

26:26.986 --> 26:30.488
Or maybe talk to the chaplain
or... or peer support?

26:30.490 --> 26:35.459
No, I just wanna know
what's going on with this case.

26:35.461 --> 26:40.464
Well, we're,
we're moving in on a suspect.

26:40.466 --> 26:44.802
But it's nothing rock solid yet.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.303
Okay.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.008
Yeah.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.687
Hi, how are you?
I'm great. Thanks for asking.

27:03.689 --> 27:06.323
Do you have a reservation?

27:06.325 --> 27:07.925
It's all good.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.994
I'm looking for the davis party.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.163
And I'm wondering
if they're here.

27:12.165 --> 27:14.398
Yes. Don't look.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.233
Just tell me where they are.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.169
By the window.
He's having dinner.

27:18.171 --> 27:22.173
With a pretty asian woman.

27:22.175 --> 27:23.674
Thank you.

27:23.676 --> 27:27.078
Stay right here.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.156
Kade davis. Can I help you?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.825
Yeah.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.560
You need to stand up for me.

27:42.562 --> 27:43.928
I'd like to know
what this is about.

27:43.930 --> 27:47.631
What's the problem here?
Back up.

27:47.633 --> 27:52.403
We can keep this civil.
I'm not going anywhere...

27:52.405 --> 27:53.437
The hell do you think
you're doing?

27:53.439 --> 27:56.240
Hands up.

27:58.211 --> 28:00.578
Where you taking me?

28:00.580 --> 28:03.380
Where do you think?
Move your ass.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.882
Let's ride.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.459
Al. Al!

28:15.461 --> 28:17.961
I can't p-what? The people
th-hey. Ove.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.597
You can't go in there, buddy.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.065
I'm just gonna watch, man.
Hang back.

28:22.068 --> 28:25.068
No, but just...

28:25.070 --> 28:28.739
Look, the observation room,
that's it.

28:28.742 --> 28:31.541
I got it.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.077
Come on, man.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.289
Quite the family tree you got.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.994
So your uncle patty,
he was a ward superintendant.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.164
<i>Till he got swept up
in operation silver shovel.</i>

28:53.166 --> 28:55.832
<i>For felony theft
and racketeering.</i>

28:55.834 --> 28:58.235
The paperwork says he flipped
on a couple of aldermen.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.539
For a reduction in sentence.

29:01.541 --> 29:04.474
Your cousin, finn.
One time city inspector.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.277
He got pinched for bribes,
money laundering,

29:07.280 --> 29:08.478
Threatening a witness.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.148
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

29:15.722 --> 29:19.489
Barry kimball.

29:19.492 --> 29:21.858
Don't know him.

29:25.398 --> 29:27.564
So...

29:27.566 --> 29:31.202
You're gonna deny to my face.

29:31.204 --> 29:35.238
Knowing or interacting
with barry kimball,

29:35.240 --> 29:37.874
Whose warehouse got torched.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.710
That's what I said.

29:48.021 --> 29:50.021
You tried to squeeze money
out of kimball.

29:50.023 --> 29:51.889
Told him you'd rat him out
to the city

29:51.890 --> 29:53.957
'cause you have connections.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.461
And he refused to pay
or he stopped paying.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.364
So you went back to your dirtbag
relatives for advice.

30:00.367 --> 30:05.168
And they told you
you had to get tough.

30:05.170 --> 30:09.439
So you went back to that
warehouse during that rave.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.974
And you torched that place.

30:10.976 --> 30:14.644
I...

30:14.646 --> 30:19.716
Kid...

30:19.718 --> 30:21.351
If the next thing
out of your face.

30:21.353 --> 30:26.224
Is, "I don't know
barry kimball,".

30:26.226 --> 30:28.025
We're gonna go for a ride.

30:31.731 --> 30:35.132
All right.
I squeezed kimball for money.

30:35.135 --> 30:37.869
He wouldn't pay. And yeah,
I had people in my ear.

30:37.870 --> 30:42.005
Telling me what the next level
should be, but it wasn't arson.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.876
And no way did I
light that place up.

30:44.878 --> 30:49.280
I didn't start that fire.
You look all you want.

31:07.233 --> 31:11.635
Yeah, your brother
operated on lexi.

31:11.637 --> 31:15.572
So please tell him
I said thanks.

31:15.574 --> 31:19.010
I know he gave it
everything he had.

31:19.012 --> 31:25.449
I will. Yeah.

31:35.861 --> 31:38.361
All right, I want
a full work-up on this guy.

31:38.363 --> 31:39.831
Search his apartment.
Let's tie him.

31:39.832 --> 31:42.166
To that brown forerange jacket.
Okay.

31:42.168 --> 31:45.168
That was patrol.
Tamra collins just woke up.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.838
In the icu at med.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.072
And she wants to talk.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.706
All right. Kim, you go with.

31:56.983 --> 32:00.117
Sweetheart, the police are here.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.021
Hi, tamra.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.224
My name is erin lindsay.

32:06.226 --> 32:08.959
And kim burgess is here,
as well.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.595
You had something
you wanted to tell us.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.398
Yes.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.534
I was there at the rave.

32:16.535 --> 32:21.104
And this guy stood...
Stood next to me.

32:21.106 --> 32:25.575
He was wearing a dark jacket.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.912
And a... and a hat.

32:28.914 --> 32:32.349
And he was holding a paper bag.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.753
He walked over to the side
and he...

32:35.755 --> 32:38.488
He dropped the paper bag
on the floor.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.823
And then stepped on it.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.526
Then he kicked it
behind the couch.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.794
He... he started to walk away.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.666
And then the bag burst
into flames.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.871
Do you remember
anything else about him?

32:54.873 --> 32:57.707
He was a little bit
taller than me.

32:57.709 --> 33:01.445
So, 5'8, maybe.

33:01.447 --> 33:05.315
And a white guy.

33:05.318 --> 33:09.452
In his 20s.

33:09.454 --> 33:14.624
He had a... a silver skull ring
on his right hand.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.727
I... i noticed it
when he wiped his eyebrow.

33:17.729 --> 33:21.264
That's really good.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.733
Is there anything else, or...

33:22.735 --> 33:25.869
Yeah, he... he had blue eyes.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.938
Blue? Are you sure?

33:30.409 --> 33:32.876
When he looked at me,
it was like.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.079
He was looking right through me.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.085
Thank you.

33:42.088 --> 33:46.090
All right, we're looking for
a male, white, 20-25,

33:46.091 --> 33:48.758
Owns a brown
forerange cargo jacket.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.195
He wears a silver skull ring
on his right hand,

33:51.197 --> 33:55.432
He's about 5'8,
and he has blue eyes.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.901
We'll run everyone in the city
with that description.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.470
All dmv, city,
county, and state employees,

34:00.472 --> 34:02.172
Anyone with a public record.

34:02.175 --> 34:04.574
Kick kade davis?

34:04.577 --> 34:07.644
Charge him with the gun first.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.646
So we're nowhere.

34:13.686 --> 34:17.387
You got that vigil
in an hour, sarge.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.456
All right, everybody get ready.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.693
I've got someone.
Male, white, dark beanie,

35:28.695 --> 35:31.227
<i>Moving to my right.</i>

35:31.229 --> 35:32.697
That one, there. Right there.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.501
Halstead,
coming to you, brother.

35:46.545 --> 35:47.777
Headed north.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.227
I got eyes. He's going
westbound down the alley.

36:13.106 --> 36:15.773
Yeah, you can stop right there.

36:33.726 --> 36:35.592
Put him in the cage.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.101
Dylan oates, 22.

36:52.103 --> 36:53.536
He's got an apartment
on west 18th.

36:53.538 --> 36:56.606
Call felony review,
get a warrant.

37:00.311 --> 37:02.111
<i>Chicago pd!</i>

37:08.453 --> 37:10.853
It's clear.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.989
Clear.

37:28.373 --> 37:31.808
<i>Jay. In here.</i>

37:37.982 --> 37:40.216
Metal wedges.

37:53.698 --> 37:56.732
I work with a detective...

37:56.734 --> 37:58.534
I mean, he's a...

37:58.536 --> 38:03.673
He's a really good friend
of mine.

38:03.675 --> 38:05.842
You killed his daughter
in that fire.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.546
I mean, I knew her
her whole life.

38:10.548 --> 38:14.550
She was...

38:14.552 --> 38:17.954
Just one of those people,
made the world a better place.

38:17.956 --> 38:20.523
I mean, she just...

38:20.525 --> 38:22.625
She had a glow.

38:30.034 --> 38:32.835
A chief at cfd,

38:32.837 --> 38:34.837
He told me arsonists
like to return.

38:34.839 --> 38:36.906
To the scene of the crime,
but I had a real strong hunch.

38:36.908 --> 38:39.876
You would anyway.

38:39.878 --> 38:44.180
Because I know
this crime was personal.

38:44.182 --> 38:48.217
You wanted to hurt someone
'cause someone hurt you.

38:48.219 --> 38:49.785
Tell me if I'm wrong.

38:51.656 --> 38:54.490
Tell me if I'm wrong!

39:00.298 --> 39:03.599
So who was it?

39:03.601 --> 39:06.469
Who pissed you off?

39:06.471 --> 39:08.537
Who broke your little heart?

39:08.539 --> 39:10.006
I have the right
to remain silent.

39:10.008 --> 39:13.276
I understand that right and
I do not wish to speak with you.

39:19.217 --> 39:22.184
You're gonna tell me
why you lit that fire.

39:22.186 --> 39:26.088
Believe me.

39:26.090 --> 39:28.925
Or you're gonna feel pain.

39:28.927 --> 39:33.396
Like you never imagined
was possible.

39:33.398 --> 39:36.766
I have the right to remain...
Which you have!

39:42.006 --> 39:44.573
Al, al, al! Al, come on, al.

39:44.575 --> 39:45.775
Come on, let me... al!

39:45.777 --> 39:47.777
Get off me! Get off me!
Come on, man!

39:47.779 --> 39:49.312
Get off me, man.
Al, al, come on.

39:49.314 --> 39:50.446
Get off me. Al.

39:50.448 --> 39:53.716
Man, get off me!
Hey, it's okay, we're good.

39:53.718 --> 39:55.418
Door's locked, we're good.
Hank, take a walk, man.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.919
Give me the keys. Al.

39:56.921 --> 40:00.389
Give me the keys!
Al, listen to me.

40:00.391 --> 40:02.124
I'm gonna turn him over
to the state's attorney...

40:02.126 --> 40:04.360
No, we're not! Yes, we are!

40:04.362 --> 40:05.861
No, we're not.
Look, it's killing me.

40:05.863 --> 40:07.697
But it's the only way, al.
Hey, when justin was killed,

40:07.699 --> 40:09.098
What did you do?

40:10.301 --> 40:11.867
Would you have let anybody
stop you if they tried?

40:11.869 --> 40:14.770
We got 39 families looking for
justice, not just one.

40:14.772 --> 40:16.973
So you don't think
that they'd be happy to hear.

40:16.975 --> 40:19.575
That this animal was dredged
out of the river?

40:19.577 --> 40:21.210
I don't know that!

40:21.212 --> 40:22.979
I don't know that,
and neither do you.

40:22.981 --> 40:24.981
And that's why it's gotta
go down this way.

40:24.983 --> 40:26.482
Give me the keys.
I can't do that, al,

40:26.484 --> 40:28.117
I'm sorry. I'm warning you, man.

40:28.119 --> 40:30.319
Well, then you're gonna have
to go through me to get him out.

40:30.321 --> 40:32.088
Go ahead.

40:44.469 --> 40:48.337
Al.

40:48.339 --> 40:51.707
Heard you had a suspect.
Wanted to check in.

40:51.709 --> 40:55.478
There he is. He confessed.

41:01.786 --> 41:05.054
Okay. To who? Me.
