00:19.456 --> 00:21.822
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Frond.

00:21.862 --> 00:24.363
I'm gonna be the most fun
chaperone you ever worked with.

00:24.432 --> 00:26.265
I'll be your one and chaperone-Ly.

00:26.351 --> 00:29.002
- Oh, he hung up.
- So you're in, Mom?

00:29.027 --> 00:32.415
Yeah. Me and my teeny Tina are
off to the Heroine Conference.

00:32.441 --> 00:33.524
Heroin Conference?

00:33.549 --> 00:35.104
What do you mean, like a jazz concert?

00:35.129 --> 00:36.846
That really isn't the best name.

00:36.894 --> 00:38.060
What would you call

00:38.146 --> 00:39.873
a weekend-long empowerment
gathering for girls

00:39.897 --> 00:41.814
with speeches from
important female leaders?

00:41.899 --> 00:42.904
Sex and the City 3.

00:42.929 --> 00:44.095
Oh, I can't wait.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.753
We haven't had special Mama-Tina time

00:45.788 --> 00:47.288
since we got stuck in the elevator

00:47.340 --> 00:48.589
at your orthodontist's.

00:48.624 --> 00:51.402
Aw, we thought we were
gonna die, remember?

00:51.427 --> 00:52.376
Yeah.

00:52.462 --> 00:54.273
And, uh, what are we gonna
do while they're gone?

00:54.297 --> 00:56.964
Enjoy all that extra room
without their boobs in the way?

00:57.050 --> 00:59.383
Mm... Maybe something
easy that costs nothing?

00:59.469 --> 01:01.385
- Tickle party?
- Eh.

01:01.471 --> 01:03.804
- Armpit farts?
- Hmm, I'd... Yeah, I'd do that.

01:03.890 --> 01:05.973
Okay, listen up.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.225
- Listen up.
- This is an overnight field trip.

01:08.311 --> 01:09.977
And you are teenagers.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.313
- So we are not fooling around here.
- Nope.

01:12.365 --> 01:15.607
If you break the rules,
you will be sent home.

01:15.632 --> 01:17.985
- That's right.
- Notice this firm, commanding voice?

01:18.037 --> 01:19.403
It's my tough voice.

01:19.489 --> 01:21.489
And when ya hear it, ya better fear it.

01:21.541 --> 01:23.302
So let's hear it. Let's
hear that tough voice.

01:23.326 --> 01:25.376
- Come on.
- What? I just did it. That-that was it.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.306
- That was... That was the tough...
- Oh. That was it.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.829
- That was it right there.
- That was it.

01:28.915 --> 01:29.997
Oh, my God, Tammy,

01:30.049 --> 01:31.999
I'm so glad we're rooming together.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.667
Me, too. We're gonna stay up late

01:33.719 --> 01:35.136
and pretend it's our apartment

01:35.171 --> 01:37.004
and we're so tired of the dating scene.

01:37.090 --> 01:38.923
Who are you rooming with, Tina?

01:39.008 --> 01:40.558
I'm rooming with a cool, older girl

01:40.643 --> 01:42.176
who happens to be married to my dad.

01:42.228 --> 01:44.428
- The bus driver?
- No, my mom.

01:44.514 --> 01:45.930
- Me! Up top.
- Here you go.

01:46.015 --> 01:47.181
Cool.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.849
- Yeah.
- Very cool.

01:48.935 --> 01:50.734
All right, people, as many of you know,

01:50.820 --> 01:52.164
this year's Heroine Conference keynote

01:52.188 --> 01:55.523
is being delivered by none
other than Bernadette Baker.

01:55.575 --> 01:57.274
- Who's she?
- She's an astronaut

01:57.360 --> 01:59.555
who flew two missions to the
International Space Station

01:59.579 --> 02:01.328
and is also a black belt in karate.

02:01.364 --> 02:03.864
- We're reading her book in class.
- Ooh.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.783
She's so mad at the Moon. I love it.

02:05.868 --> 02:07.668
Linda, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.286
Here's something fun and mandatory...

02:09.372 --> 02:11.539
Write down one question for Ms. Baker.

02:11.624 --> 02:13.374
If the conference people
pick your question,

02:13.459 --> 02:15.759
you'll get to ask it
yourself during the Q&A.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.461
Whoa. Did you hear that, Mom?

02:17.547 --> 02:19.031
Huh? What? No.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.976
I-I'm a chaperone, I don't
have to listen to him.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.767
There's our guy.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.936
So... no dames tonight.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.721
Just us boys. So what are we doing?

02:27.773 --> 02:29.273
Yeah, wow us, Pops.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.724
Uh, we could watch a movie.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.143
Maybe, like, a guy movie?

02:32.228 --> 02:33.727
Hmm. Like what?

02:33.779 --> 02:35.196
Magic Mike? Finally?

02:35.231 --> 02:36.447
Maybe. Maybe not.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.865
Maybe something else.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.483
Great. Let's close up this slop shop

02:39.569 --> 02:40.651
and get to it.

02:40.736 --> 02:42.369
We're not closing early, Louise.

02:42.405 --> 02:44.572
Why not? The only person
who comes in here is Teddy,

02:44.624 --> 02:46.707
and you can just leave
his burger on the sidewalk.

02:46.742 --> 02:48.792
Yeah, like Mom does. Wait, what?

02:48.878 --> 02:49.960
She puts 'em on a plate.

02:50.046 --> 02:51.212
It's called class.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.250
Wow. I've never seen

02:56.302 --> 02:58.219
so many girls my age
in one place before.

02:58.254 --> 03:00.304
That's because we don't
tell you where we hang out.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.725
It's not the mall.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.071
Okay, do I have everyone's questions

03:06.095 --> 03:07.478
for the astronaut?

03:07.563 --> 03:09.813
Let's see. Tammy Larson asks,

03:09.899 --> 03:11.732
"How do you poop in space?"

03:11.767 --> 03:13.100
It's a serious question.

03:13.186 --> 03:14.935
How does anyone poop anywhere?

03:15.021 --> 03:16.937
Okay. "How do you pee in space?"

03:16.989 --> 03:18.822
"How do you poop in space?" Another pee.

03:18.908 --> 03:21.275
"How do aliens poop?" Okay, here we go.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.277
"Who inspired you to go to space?"

03:23.362 --> 03:25.279
A thoughtful question from Tina.

03:25.364 --> 03:26.864
Thanks, Mr. Frond.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.464
Glad we didn't go with
the poop question, huh?

03:28.489 --> 03:29.393
I know.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.452
Mrs. Belcher, would you
mind getting us checked in?

03:31.504 --> 03:33.754
Sure. Check me out, getting checked in.

03:33.789 --> 03:34.872
Nice, Mom.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.759
What chapter are you on?

03:38.794 --> 03:40.427
Uh, the one before she goes to space

03:40.463 --> 03:41.879
but after she started karate.

03:41.964 --> 03:43.264
That's a good one.

03:43.299 --> 03:45.633
I'm Tina. But my friends call me Blaze.

03:46.433 --> 03:47.968
They don't. I don't
know why I said that.

03:48.054 --> 03:49.136
I'm Dillon.

03:49.222 --> 03:50.621
I hear that.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.607
Sorry. I don't know
why I said that, either.

03:53.643 --> 03:54.975
It's okay.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.061
I get this way on field trips.

03:57.146 --> 03:58.779
I get it. When I went to camp,

03:58.814 --> 04:01.365
I said my name was Dallas,
and I was from Houston.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.783
I hear that.

04:02.818 --> 04:04.338
- Hey, it kind of worked that time.
- Yeah.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.320
Okay, it looks like your block of rooms

04:06.372 --> 04:08.038
is good to go.

04:08.063 --> 04:09.884
Make sure to join us
for the buffet breakfast

04:09.909 --> 04:11.825
by our beautiful water feature.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.161
Ooh, water feature.

04:14.247 --> 04:15.913
Smells like chlorine. Nice!

04:15.998 --> 04:19.011
Now, for your room, would
you like one key or two?

04:19.036 --> 04:21.334
Two. For me and my daughter slash BFF.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.637
- We're roomies.
- That's so sweet.

04:23.673 --> 04:25.506
Enjoy it while it lasts.

04:25.591 --> 04:27.174
Right? Wait, what?

04:27.260 --> 04:28.592
Hi, I'm Amy.

04:28.678 --> 04:30.010
I'm a chaperone this weekend.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.512
Hi. Me, too. Linda.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.731
What do you mean, "Enjoy
it while it lasts"?

04:33.816 --> 04:35.349
Well, how old's your daughter?

04:35.434 --> 04:36.567
Thirteen.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.068
Oh. Yeah.

04:38.154 --> 04:39.937
My daughter's 13, too.

04:40.022 --> 04:42.189
When we started the year,
she let me talk to her.

04:42.275 --> 04:43.490
And be seen with her.

04:43.526 --> 04:44.742
And chew food around her.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.443
You can't chew food around her?

04:46.529 --> 04:48.279
To be fair, I chew weird.

04:48.364 --> 04:49.413
I chew weird.

04:49.498 --> 04:50.698
Really weird.

04:50.783 --> 04:52.199
Aw, but Tina's Tina.

04:52.285 --> 04:54.084
She's Mama's little girl.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.420
That's your daughter? She's
talking to my daughter.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.385
They're coming over here. How do I look?

04:58.457 --> 05:00.007
- Mom, can I...
- Mom, I want to...

05:00.042 --> 05:01.425
Wait, is that...

05:01.510 --> 05:03.677
This is your mom, too? Are we sisters?

05:03.713 --> 05:05.045
This is fun.

05:05.131 --> 05:07.381
The chaperone-ettes find
each other in a crowd.

05:07.466 --> 05:08.466
- Hi, Dillon!
- No, thanks.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.933
Okay!

05:10.019 --> 05:12.436
Mom, Dillon and I were wondering
if we could room together?

05:12.521 --> 05:15.189
What? Room together? What?

05:15.224 --> 05:16.690
I was gonna have a room to myself,

05:16.726 --> 05:18.225
but this'll be more fun.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.893
Oh, then I could room with you, Linda.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.195
I was gonna drive home tonight

05:21.230 --> 05:22.590
and then drive back in the morning.

05:22.648 --> 05:24.031
It's just four hours away.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.734
Tina, what about our
mommy-daughter weekend?

05:26.819 --> 05:28.035
Mom, please?

05:28.070 --> 05:30.904
Uh, okay. Sure. But if
you change your mind,

05:30.990 --> 05:32.684
- I'll be right here in the...
- Yay! Thanks, Mom.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.075
Welcome to the Rejected Moms Club.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.708
It's probably a joke. Yeah, and...

05:37.217 --> 05:38.689
Tina's gonna come back
any second and say,

05:38.714 --> 05:40.331
"Not!" Or "Psyche!"

05:40.416 --> 05:41.715
See?

05:41.751 --> 05:43.634
♪ There's my little girl. ♪

05:43.719 --> 05:46.223
I accidentally pushed the "door
open" button. Bye, Mom.

05:46.248 --> 05:47.817
Oh.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.652
So, two chaperones sharing a room.

05:52.677 --> 05:54.077
Do you snore? 'Cause I snore.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.645
It would be fun if we both snored.

05:55.714 --> 05:56.980
I can't believe Tina ditched me

05:57.049 --> 05:58.631
for some girl she just met.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.468
Eh, they'll like us again
by the time they're 30.

06:01.503 --> 06:03.401
Get a hobby. I scrapbook.

06:03.426 --> 06:05.378
That's Dillon's report card.

06:05.403 --> 06:07.640
That's a thing she dropped in the car.

06:07.676 --> 06:09.592
Huh. Lot of pictures of her sleeping.

06:09.678 --> 06:11.761
Mm-hmm. It's almost as good

06:11.847 --> 06:14.481
as actually hanging out with
Dillon and talking to her.

06:14.516 --> 06:18.518
- Right. That's not completely sad.
- No, it is.

06:18.603 --> 06:20.904
Okay. Uh, I'm gonna go check on Tina.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.356
You sure you don't want
to scrap it out with me?

06:23.408 --> 06:25.024
Aah... Little scrap sesh?

06:25.110 --> 06:27.494
- No...
- I have scalloping shears.

06:27.529 --> 06:28.862
- Snip, snip.
- Uh...

06:28.914 --> 06:31.865
No. No, thanks. No snip, snip.

06:31.950 --> 06:33.098
Okay.

06:33.123 --> 06:35.186
Guy movies. Uh, I've got
a young Clint Eastwood.

06:35.211 --> 06:35.872
Nice.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.682
- I've got middle-aged Charles Bronson.
- Yes.

06:37.706 --> 06:39.622
And I've got old Michael Caine. Mm.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.040
And I've got Bachelor Party,

06:41.126 --> 06:42.625
which is probably not appropriate.

06:42.711 --> 06:44.995
Tom Hanks in the '80s?
Please and Hank you.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.263
Well, at least that's
got "party" in the title.

06:47.349 --> 06:49.716
What even happens at a
bachelor party, anyway?

06:49.801 --> 06:51.121
Like, what happened at yours, Dad?

06:51.186 --> 06:52.635
Uh, I'm not sure I had one.

06:52.721 --> 06:53.970
That good, huh?

06:54.055 --> 06:55.605
Oh, my God. This is perfect.

06:55.690 --> 06:57.607
- Wait. What's perfect?
- Don't you see?

06:57.692 --> 06:58.858
This is the Mom-less,

06:58.894 --> 07:01.027
Tina-free fun we've been looking for.

07:01.062 --> 07:02.645
Dad, we're gonna give you

07:02.731 --> 07:04.898
the bachelor party you never had.

07:04.983 --> 07:06.699
A dad-chelor party.

07:06.735 --> 07:08.868
Guys, no. I don't want a bachelor party.

07:08.904 --> 07:10.715
- I don't need one at all.
- Dad-chelor party!

07:10.739 --> 07:11.988
One last night of fun

07:12.073 --> 07:14.541
before you marry that old bag Linda.

07:15.684 --> 07:16.943
Hi, Mom.

07:16.968 --> 07:18.050
Uh, what's up?

07:18.075 --> 07:19.712
Just checking in.

07:19.755 --> 07:21.087
- Oh, wh...
- Yeah, whatcha doing?

07:21.166 --> 07:22.081
What's this?

07:22.134 --> 07:23.249
Reading tarot cards.

07:23.301 --> 07:24.501
Which I have done before.

07:24.586 --> 07:25.668
As you well know.

07:25.754 --> 07:27.754
Ooh, tarot cards, freaky.

07:27.806 --> 07:29.305
Come on, deal me in. What's wild?

07:29.391 --> 07:31.339
Uh, Mom, it doesn't work that way.

07:31.364 --> 07:32.475
Good chaperoning, though.

07:32.561 --> 07:33.905
I think we're all set here. Good night.

07:33.929 --> 07:35.929
Oh, I get what's going on.

07:36.014 --> 07:37.647
You think the mean, pretty chaperone

07:37.732 --> 07:39.766
came to crack down on your fun.

07:39.851 --> 07:42.235
Well, I left my
chaperone hat in my room.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.187
My room key, too. I forgot my room key.

07:44.272 --> 07:45.633
- Ha. Good one, Linda. Ha.
- Well, sounds like

07:45.657 --> 07:46.817
you got a lot going on, so...

07:46.858 --> 07:48.612
Hey, I got an idea.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.433
How about we get out
of this stuffy old room

07:50.458 --> 07:52.195
and do something really fun?

07:52.280 --> 07:54.864
But Mr. Frond said if we leave
the room we'll get sent home.

07:54.950 --> 07:57.558
Aw, don't worry about Mr. No-Fun Frond.

07:57.583 --> 07:58.809
You're with me.

07:58.834 --> 08:02.038
Wow, Tina. Your mom's... a lot.

08:02.123 --> 08:04.874
That's right, random new friend.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.292
Come on, let's do it!

08:06.344 --> 08:08.294
Fun, right?

08:08.380 --> 08:10.129
We're walking around.

08:10.215 --> 08:12.432
Ooh, look, someone got room service.

08:12.467 --> 08:15.101
Mom, this was nice but I think
Dillon and I should go back now.

08:15.136 --> 08:17.720
Why? We haven't even
gotten to the fun part yet.

08:17.806 --> 08:19.689
What is the fun part?

08:19.774 --> 08:22.475
The fun part, Dillon, is we're gonna...

08:22.561 --> 08:24.978
take the fries and spell out "hello."

08:25.063 --> 08:26.980
In fries! Ha! Great prank.

08:27.032 --> 08:29.449
And that's a prank because... ?

08:29.484 --> 08:31.204
Well, if you don't get
it, you don't get it.

08:31.669 --> 08:33.285
Another round of shots, gentlemen?

08:33.321 --> 08:34.881
Ugh. I think I've had
all the apple juice

08:34.905 --> 08:35.989
I can stomach, Louise.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.323
That's a yes. Gene?

08:37.409 --> 08:39.741
Yeah! Speeches! Speeches!

08:39.828 --> 08:42.160
Let me tell you something
about this son of a bitch.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.496
Gene's cut off. No speech.

08:43.548 --> 08:44.631
Oh, boo.

08:44.666 --> 08:45.582
Having a good time, Dad?

08:45.667 --> 08:46.916
Oh, yeah.

08:47.002 --> 08:48.529
Should we call it a night?

08:48.553 --> 08:50.503
- I'll get it!
- Oh, no. Who's at the door?

08:50.589 --> 08:54.090
Maybe somebody ordered a sexy surprise?

08:54.175 --> 08:55.725
Bachelor party!

08:55.810 --> 08:57.620
- You invited Teddy?
- We kept it small.

08:57.645 --> 08:59.073
What, do you want to
go wide with this list?

08:59.097 --> 09:01.814
Make room on the couch, Bob. Make room.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.766
Uh... Louise, pour me one.

09:03.852 --> 09:05.206
- Hit me.
- Bam. Here's one.

09:05.231 --> 09:06.329
Give me another one.

09:06.354 --> 09:07.687
I got to catch up.

09:09.521 --> 09:10.887
There it goes.

09:10.972 --> 09:12.497
Soda in the elevator.

09:12.522 --> 09:14.033
Yup. There it goes.

09:14.058 --> 09:15.224
Perfect prank.

09:15.310 --> 09:17.360
Oh, yawn.

09:17.445 --> 09:18.644
Dillon, are you yawning?

09:18.730 --> 09:20.029
I think we're both yawning.

09:20.114 --> 09:21.314
Oh, yeah.

09:21.366 --> 09:22.899
Maybe we should both go to bed.

09:22.984 --> 09:24.617
Bed? What?

09:24.652 --> 09:26.684
But the most fun part
hasn't happened yet.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.548
We're gonna, uh... Huh.

09:28.573 --> 09:29.822
Mom? What are you doing?

09:29.874 --> 09:32.158
I don't know, what am I doing?

09:32.210 --> 09:34.104
Just popping the top off
this little bottle of shampoo,

09:34.128 --> 09:36.162
and, uh...

09:36.214 --> 09:37.163
- Mom, no!
- Whoa.

09:37.215 --> 09:38.769
It's fun! You do it.

09:38.794 --> 09:40.666
I don't... really want to.

09:40.718 --> 09:42.134
What about you, Dillon? Huh?

09:42.170 --> 09:43.970
Better than tarot cards, right?

09:44.005 --> 09:46.839
Uh, I don't know if you
can really compare the two?

09:46.925 --> 09:49.058
Aw, party sham-poopers.

09:49.143 --> 09:50.593
It's starting to foam.

09:50.678 --> 09:52.011
Come on, get in on this.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.396
Our water feature!

09:53.481 --> 09:56.682
Is someone throwing shampoo
into our water feature? No!

09:56.768 --> 09:57.912
Okay. Uh, uh, okay. All right.

09:57.936 --> 09:58.851
Let's go. Let's go. Just go.

09:58.903 --> 10:00.340
Oh, Mr. Frond!

10:00.405 --> 10:01.854
- Linda.
- Oh, no.

10:01.906 --> 10:04.657
Yeah. As in, "Oh, no, you didn't."

10:04.692 --> 10:06.742
Eh, at least he didn't
do his tough voice.

10:06.828 --> 10:07.944
That was my tough voice.

10:08.029 --> 10:09.078
Yeah, no, yeah.

10:10.582 --> 10:11.831
♪ Eh, ah, ooh, ah. ♪

10:11.866 --> 10:14.367
Gene, seriously, no
more apple juice for you.

10:14.419 --> 10:16.013
I can't believe you're
getting married, Bobby!

10:17.372 --> 10:19.088
Teddy, maybe take it down a notch.

10:19.173 --> 10:21.374
Hello? Sorry, I, uh, I can't hear you.

10:21.459 --> 10:22.842
Guys, turn the music down!

10:22.877 --> 10:24.348
I heard, "Turn it up"?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.796
- Bob?
- Linda? Is everything okay?

10:26.881 --> 10:28.381
I need you to come here.

10:28.466 --> 10:29.765
What? You're two hours away.

10:29.851 --> 10:30.883
What's going on?

10:30.935 --> 10:32.112
Uh, there's been some trouble,

10:32.136 --> 10:34.136
and someone's getting sent home.

10:34.222 --> 10:35.638
Sorry, I can't hear you.

10:35.723 --> 10:37.139
Guys, volume.

10:37.225 --> 10:38.608
Pressing bass boost.

10:38.693 --> 10:40.109
Tina's being sent home?

10:40.194 --> 10:41.560
Uh, someone else.

10:41.646 --> 10:43.279
Guys, please! Sorry, Lin,

10:43.364 --> 10:45.147
we're having a bachelor party.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.532
He's getting cold feet, Mom.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.484
This phone call's not helping.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.119
- I said...
- Aah!

10:50.204 --> 10:52.294
I got in trouble and
I'm getting sent home!

10:52.319 --> 10:54.240
- Oh, my God.
- I dance-kicked the stereo.

10:54.265 --> 10:56.239
Oh you're on the phone. Sorry, Bob.

10:58.028 --> 11:01.153
Thanks for waiting for 
your dad with me, Tina.

11:01.482 --> 11:03.649
Ha. It's not the silent treatment,

11:03.735 --> 11:05.151
if that's what you're thinking.

11:05.236 --> 11:07.069
She's probably just trying to come up

11:07.105 --> 11:09.271
with the perfect little
joke to lighten up the mood.

11:09.357 --> 11:10.809
Sometimes it takes her hours.

11:10.834 --> 11:14.160
- Hi, everyone. This is... awkward.
- You think?

11:14.245 --> 11:15.995
I don't know, I'm liking the vibe.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.092
Now that your ride is here,
I'm going to get some rest.

11:18.116 --> 11:19.645
I suggest you do the same, Tina.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.731
You're gonna be talking to
Bernadette Baker tomorrow.

11:21.756 --> 11:24.036
What? Tina, they picked your question?

11:24.122 --> 11:25.454
Why didn't you tell me?

11:25.506 --> 11:26.984
I wanted to, Mom, but you were too busy

11:27.008 --> 11:28.424
embarrassing me and being crazy!

11:29.764 --> 11:32.094
I'm not sure that lightened the mood.

11:32.130 --> 11:33.796
Linda, what did you do, exactly?

11:33.821 --> 11:36.770
- Nothing. It was nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

11:36.795 --> 11:38.946
We have a beautiful water
feature in our courtyard

11:38.970 --> 11:41.755
and your wife threw
shampoo bottles into it.

11:41.780 --> 11:43.639
The courtyard is covered in lather.

11:43.691 --> 11:46.442
I guess we're calling anything
a courtyard these days, huh?

11:46.477 --> 11:48.978
Please remove your wife.
She is no longer welcome here

11:49.003 --> 11:50.676
at the Brewster Courtyard Gardens Hotel.

11:50.701 --> 11:52.459
But your motto is "You're always welcome

11:52.483 --> 11:54.661
at the Brewster
Courtyard Gardens Hotel."

11:54.686 --> 11:56.880
- Not you! Not anymore.
- Mom?

11:56.905 --> 11:59.044
- Yes, sweetie?
- You should just go.

11:59.069 --> 12:02.270
- You really embarrassed me tonight.
- Tina, no. I'm going to bed.

12:02.295 --> 12:05.911
I can't remember which room I'm in,
but I'm sure I'll recognize the door.

12:06.223 --> 12:08.724
She's gonna be wandering
around up there all night.

12:08.749 --> 12:11.130
Yep. She belongs to the hotel now.

12:11.636 --> 12:14.420
Embarrassed her? I embarrassed her?

12:14.445 --> 12:16.640
Dad, we're not driving all
the way back tonight, are we?

12:16.724 --> 12:18.257
I mean, it's after midnight.

12:18.342 --> 12:19.809
Well, it's not like we can stay here.

12:19.844 --> 12:21.567
Your mom is banned. A lot.

12:21.592 --> 12:24.510
Hello? There's a motel
right across the street.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.484
- Ugh.
- Yes!

12:25.509 --> 12:27.266
Every good dad-chelor party

12:27.291 --> 12:28.958
ends at a motel just like that.

12:28.983 --> 12:31.350
Well, I am really tired.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.375
There's the party animal.

12:37.411 --> 12:39.945
It's not like Tina to
blow me off like that.

12:40.031 --> 12:41.363
She didn't mean anything by it.

12:41.388 --> 12:42.671
I mean, she definitely meant it.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.644
But she won't tomorrow. As much.

12:44.669 --> 12:45.751
I mean, let's sleep.

12:45.837 --> 12:46.869
We should just sleep.

12:46.954 --> 12:48.921
No way! Bachelor party rules:

12:49.006 --> 12:50.873
you can pass out but you can't sleep.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.294
Fine, I'm passing out.

12:52.319 --> 12:54.877
Then I guess you're cool
with your face being drawn on.

12:54.929 --> 12:56.428
Mm... if it's tasteful.

12:56.453 --> 12:58.319
- Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
- Oh, yeah.

13:03.364 --> 13:04.997
_

13:05.022 --> 13:06.138
There she is.

13:06.163 --> 13:07.879
My teeny Tina.

13:09.721 --> 13:11.587
Aw.

13:11.612 --> 13:14.029
Tina, Wha... what's going on?

13:14.065 --> 13:15.426
You're embarrassing me, Mom!

13:15.451 --> 13:16.567
What the... ?

13:18.233 --> 13:20.684
Tina. Don't run away from Mommy.

13:23.374 --> 13:25.012
Hi, Linda!

13:25.037 --> 13:27.487
Want to borrow my scalloping shears?

13:27.512 --> 13:28.795
Shears, shears...

13:28.820 --> 13:31.487
No... !

13:31.883 --> 13:33.465
Scalloping shears!

13:33.490 --> 13:35.584
I'm losing Tina.

13:35.636 --> 13:38.087
Mm... I want scallops.

13:39.470 --> 13:42.137
I got most of the pen off my face.

13:42.162 --> 13:43.578
Thanks, guys, for that.

13:43.603 --> 13:45.405
Wait'll you see what
we wrote on your back.

13:45.429 --> 13:46.929
Lin, you coming?

13:46.981 --> 13:49.248
What if... Hear me out for a second...

13:49.317 --> 13:51.550
- This is gonna be good.
- Mm-hmm.

13:51.575 --> 13:53.608
What if, instead of going home,

13:53.633 --> 13:56.300
we sneak into the hotel to
see Tina ask her question

13:56.325 --> 13:57.590
to the lady astronaut?

13:57.615 --> 13:59.801
Oh. Not as good as I
thought it was gonna be.

13:59.826 --> 14:02.069
Linda, that's a really bad idea.

14:02.094 --> 14:04.528
We should probably give Tina
some breathing room right now.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.801
I'm losing her, Bob.

14:05.857 --> 14:07.356
I need to get into that conference.

14:07.441 --> 14:09.441
But you're not allowed
back in the hotel.

14:09.614 --> 14:11.911
Well... I could wear a disguise.

14:11.996 --> 14:13.863
- A disguise?
- I'm back on board.

14:13.948 --> 14:15.948
See? That's why you're
gonna marry this gal.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.533
You really want to do this?

14:17.585 --> 14:18.951
I need to do this.

14:19.036 --> 14:22.371
Okay, red flags all over the place,

14:22.396 --> 14:25.184
but let's go get you a disguise.

14:25.209 --> 14:26.876
Let's see, we've got sunglasses,

14:26.961 --> 14:29.428
but that's a little boring.
How about a bandanna?

14:29.514 --> 14:31.514
They come in camouflage
or pink camouflage.

14:31.549 --> 14:33.966
- Pink camouflage.
- Mother, good choice.

14:34.051 --> 14:36.135
Great choice. May I make a suggestion?

14:36.220 --> 14:38.972
This T-shirt makes it look
like you're wearing a bikini.

14:38.997 --> 14:40.139
That's pretty good.

14:40.164 --> 14:42.059
- It's perfect.
- We'll take two.

14:44.312 --> 14:45.644
How do I look?

14:45.730 --> 14:47.446
Like someone who swallows cigarettes

14:47.532 --> 14:48.981
for free drinks at bars.

14:49.066 --> 14:53.035
All right. It says Bernadette
Baker goes on in 15 minutes.

14:53.070 --> 14:55.371
An astronaut and a karate expert?

14:55.406 --> 14:56.372
Pick a lane.

14:57.792 --> 14:58.908
That's her.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.875
What?

14:59.911 --> 15:01.855
Uh, I got to... pee.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.914
Uh, you guys find seats,
and I'll be right back.

15:05.436 --> 15:06.568
Huh.

15:08.403 --> 15:09.585
Oh, Louise.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.053
What are you up to, Mom?

15:11.088 --> 15:13.255
What? Nothing.

15:13.307 --> 15:15.402
Okay, fine, I'll tell you,
but don't tell your father.

15:15.426 --> 15:18.060
I can't get through to
Tina, but you know what can?

15:18.095 --> 15:19.645
Some strong heroine.

15:19.730 --> 15:21.325
Now you go to the
seats and cover for me.

15:21.349 --> 15:22.681
Mama's going backstage.

15:22.767 --> 15:24.266
- Wait, wait, Mom.
- What?

15:24.318 --> 15:27.122
Price tag. You would
have looked ridiculous.

15:29.521 --> 15:30.387
Uh-oh.

15:30.412 --> 15:32.661
Bernadette Baker's
keynote is in ten minutes.

15:32.778 --> 15:34.637
Tina, since you're asking a question

15:34.662 --> 15:35.994
you should sit by the aisle.

15:36.013 --> 15:38.046
Okay. Uh, can I sit
with my friend Dillon?

15:38.098 --> 15:39.264
She's from another school.

15:39.349 --> 15:40.548
She's from another school.

15:40.601 --> 15:43.101
Yeah, we get it. You made a friend.

15:43.186 --> 15:44.970
Yeah, Tina, we get it.

15:45.270 --> 15:46.554
Good morning.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.722
Hey.

15:47.774 --> 15:49.224
How are you enjoying your stay?

15:49.309 --> 15:51.559
Oh, fine, fine. Great fountain.

15:51.612 --> 15:52.894
Thank you.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.563
Zero gravity. Zero fear.

15:55.649 --> 15:56.649
Bernadette,

15:56.733 --> 15:58.233
you are cleared for takeoff.

15:58.285 --> 15:59.234
Excuse me.

16:00.737 --> 16:02.237
Are you Bernadette Baker?

16:02.289 --> 16:04.239
Ooh, sorry, you're just a lady.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.241
I thought you were my sensei testing me.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.895
He wears that bandanna as well.

16:09.663 --> 16:11.246
- Where's your mom?
- You know Mom.

16:11.289 --> 16:12.705
She loves her hotel bathrooms.

16:12.749 --> 16:14.716
And they fear her.

16:14.751 --> 16:16.334
I still can't believe your mom.

16:16.420 --> 16:19.421
Those were some crazy,
smother-mother moves last night.

16:19.506 --> 16:22.340
Yeah. As Bernadette would
say, "Give me some space."

16:22.426 --> 16:24.893
Ugh, my mom's trying
to invade my eye space.

16:24.928 --> 16:26.678
- Uh?
- Uh-uh.

16:26.763 --> 16:28.680
- Uh? Uh?
- No, not happening.

16:28.765 --> 16:30.815
So, that's not a bikini?

16:30.901 --> 16:32.233
No. I'm in a disguise.

16:32.269 --> 16:34.102
- Okay.
- My real identity?

16:34.154 --> 16:36.655
Well, let's just say I'm
a mother with a daughter.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.573
- You're a mother, right?
- I am not a mother.

16:38.608 --> 16:40.253
I thought it said you
were a mother in your book.

16:40.277 --> 16:41.277
It did not say that.

16:41.328 --> 16:42.610
I did not read it.

16:42.696 --> 16:45.497
I think I-I have to go on now.

16:45.582 --> 16:47.415
- Wait, wait. Listen, Bernadette.
- Mm?

16:47.451 --> 16:49.951
At the end of your speech,
my daughter is gonna ask

16:50.037 --> 16:51.753
who inspired you to go to space,

16:51.788 --> 16:54.205
and I need you to say, "My mother."

16:54.230 --> 16:56.280
I'm sorry, you want me to do what?

16:56.305 --> 16:58.437
My daughter doesn't
understand the importance

16:58.462 --> 17:00.178
of a mommy-daughter relationship.

17:00.263 --> 17:02.013
She thinks I'm embarrassing.

17:02.099 --> 17:03.159
That's crazy.

17:03.183 --> 17:04.549
Why would she think that?

17:04.634 --> 17:07.469
I know. Listen, you
can set her straight.

17:07.521 --> 17:09.304
Ms. Baker? They're ready for you.

17:09.388 --> 17:10.637
I have to go now,

17:10.723 --> 17:12.022
and I want to go.

17:12.048 --> 17:13.714
- Hey, look at me.
- Hmm?

17:13.739 --> 17:15.705
- I like you, too.
- Sure.

17:15.811 --> 17:17.945
It's my pleasure to introduce

17:17.981 --> 17:20.482
this year's Heroine
Conference keynote speaker,

17:20.534 --> 17:22.701
a woman who is truly out of this world,

17:22.847 --> 17:24.296
Bernadette Baker.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.681
Uh, thank you.

17:25.705 --> 17:28.289
Thank you so much for being here today.

17:28.325 --> 17:30.825
And thank you to myself,
which is also important.

17:31.192 --> 17:33.044
So, in conclusion,

17:33.130 --> 17:37.298
outer space, determination and karate.

17:37.334 --> 17:39.084
Thank you. Thank you.

17:40.170 --> 17:42.170
Wow, I am inspired.

17:42.222 --> 17:44.223
- Are you inspired?
- Are you crying?

17:44.307 --> 17:46.674
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Time for the Q&A.

17:46.727 --> 17:48.059
If your question was picked,

17:48.145 --> 17:50.095
please line up behind
one of the microphones.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.396
Okay. Here it comes.

17:51.481 --> 17:52.698
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

17:52.723 --> 17:53.765
Okay.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.495
If you were going to space again

17:56.520 --> 17:59.571
and you could only bring
one CD, what would it be?

17:59.596 --> 18:02.157
Dave Matthews Band, Live At
Red Rocks. Great question.

18:02.192 --> 18:06.161
No one's from Mars, no one's
from Venus, end of discussion.

18:06.196 --> 18:10.031
The crotch, the throat and
the eyes, in that order.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.199
Practice at home.

18:11.284 --> 18:12.500
Next question. Go ahead.

18:12.536 --> 18:14.903
Hi. I'm Tina. I'm 13 years old.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.269
And I'd like to know, who
inspired you to go to space?

18:18.294 --> 18:21.044
- Oh. Hmm.
- Come on, astronaut lady.

18:21.069 --> 18:22.294
Lin, shh.

18:22.319 --> 18:23.472
- You shush.
- Sorry.

18:23.497 --> 18:25.800
The person who inspired me

18:25.825 --> 18:28.016
to go to space was...

18:28.051 --> 18:29.847
Say it. Say it.

18:29.872 --> 18:31.745
... my seventh-grade chemistry teacher.

18:31.770 --> 18:34.055
What?! No, no.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.223
Linda, what are you doing?

18:35.308 --> 18:36.608
Uh, yes, go ahead?

18:36.693 --> 18:38.726
Why do you go to space?

18:38.779 --> 18:40.278
Everything's here.

18:40.363 --> 18:41.229
This question again.

18:41.314 --> 18:42.375
Okay, well, let me first say...

18:43.450 --> 18:45.380
Uh, excuse me, Bernadette.

18:45.405 --> 18:48.119
Um, back to that last girl's question:

18:48.205 --> 18:50.448
are you sure you answered
that one correctly?

18:50.473 --> 18:51.372
Mom?!

18:51.408 --> 18:53.908
Is there someone else who inspired you?

18:53.960 --> 18:55.827
Someone in your family, maybe?

18:55.912 --> 18:59.414
Um, I don't think that
this is, uh, the time...

18:59.466 --> 19:01.382
Uh-huh, uh-huh, like, um, um,

19:01.418 --> 19:04.252
what's it called when you're
not the daddy but you're the... ?

19:04.304 --> 19:06.004
I have a follow-up to the follow-up.

19:06.089 --> 19:08.339
What happens if your mom acts
crazy and wears a disguise

19:08.425 --> 19:09.902
to sneak into a thing,
even though you told her

19:09.926 --> 19:11.810
- she couldn't come?
- Oh, God.

19:11.895 --> 19:14.262
Um, um, what if the mom
only did that because

19:14.314 --> 19:17.098
her daughter has been
blowing her off all weekend?

19:17.150 --> 19:18.817
What if she wasn't blowing anyone off,

19:18.842 --> 19:20.737
she just wanted to hang out
with her new friend her own age?!

19:20.821 --> 19:22.103
Huh, Bernadette?!

19:22.189 --> 19:23.905
- Uh...
- A mom can be a friend,

19:23.940 --> 19:25.106
right, Bernadette?

19:25.192 --> 19:26.502
Would a friend embarrass you,

19:26.526 --> 19:28.206
and pour shampoo in a
fountain, Bernadette?

19:28.245 --> 19:29.828
Pouring shampoo in a fountain

19:29.913 --> 19:32.080
is not embarrassing, it's really cool.

19:32.115 --> 19:34.165
All right, I'm beginning to suspect that

19:34.251 --> 19:35.617
that is Linda Belcher.

19:35.702 --> 19:37.619
And you, Linda, are not welcome here.

19:37.704 --> 19:40.371
Shush, Frond. I got one more question.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.325
What if the mom only did that
stuff 'cause she was afraid?

19:43.372 --> 19:44.854
'Cause she thought her daughter was

19:44.878 --> 19:46.427
turning into a different person,

19:46.463 --> 19:49.097
someone who thinks it's
weird to be close to her mom.

19:49.132 --> 19:52.350
Okay, that's a damn good
disguise, but the jig is up.

19:52.375 --> 19:53.908
- Come with me.
- Mom...

19:53.933 --> 19:55.690
I don't think it's
weird to be close to you.

19:55.715 --> 19:57.769
You did embarrass me last night,

19:57.794 --> 20:01.526
and a lot right now, and I'm
sure a lot more in the future,

20:01.747 --> 20:04.646
but I'm lucky I have a mom I'm close to,

20:04.731 --> 20:06.171
and I don't ever want that to change.

20:06.199 --> 20:08.616
Aw. My teeny Tina.

20:08.652 --> 20:09.652
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

20:09.703 --> 20:11.356
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

20:11.381 --> 20:13.645
- Sorry. Let me get through.
- Pardon me. Sorry.

20:16.669 --> 20:19.210
Was that meant for me?
That was meant for me.

20:19.296 --> 20:20.828
Too much, Mom. Too much.

20:20.881 --> 20:23.047
Can't stop now.

20:23.133 --> 20:25.416
This was a horrible idea.

20:25.502 --> 20:27.168
Excuse me. Come on. Time to go.

20:27.220 --> 20:29.003
Okay, okay. I'm hugging my daughter.

20:29.055 --> 20:30.138
Should I go with you, Mom?

20:30.173 --> 20:33.258
No. Stay. Stay. Have fun with Dillon.

20:33.343 --> 20:35.927
Okay. Thanks. But could you,

20:36.012 --> 20:37.645
um, let go of my wrist.

20:37.681 --> 20:38.824
Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry. Yeah.

20:38.848 --> 20:39.848
Sorry, Bernadette.

20:39.933 --> 20:41.432
I-I guess I got to leave,

20:41.518 --> 20:43.101
but I just wanted to say thank you.

20:43.186 --> 20:46.154
It was a great story, and
you're a real inspiration.

20:46.189 --> 20:47.689
Best bachelor party ever!

20:47.741 --> 20:48.856
I-I-It's my bachelor party.

20:48.942 --> 20:50.358
Bob, we got to go!

20:50.410 --> 20:52.610
Uh, that-that's my
wi... I, uh... fiancée.

20:52.696 --> 20:55.246
Let's get these two
crazy kids to the altar!
