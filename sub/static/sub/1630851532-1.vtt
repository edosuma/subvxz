WEBVTT

00:37.268 --> 00:39.071
Hey, I'm running behind
schedule.

00:39.104 --> 00:40.539
Can you be Wonderwoman
for me again?

00:40.573 --> 00:43.076
I don't know.
How big is my Christmas bonus?

00:43.109 --> 00:44.743
- Substantial.
- Good because I have

00:44.777 --> 00:47.380
those finalization documents
in my hand, and your coffee.

00:47.412 --> 00:49.481
Great. Did the money
transfer to the escrow?

00:49.515 --> 00:52.551
You know what? Never mind.
I'm getting on the elevator.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.820
I... You and the elevator.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.358
Be sure to call the office
in Des Moines

00:59.390 --> 01:00.792
and get that money into escrow.

01:00.826 --> 01:02.594
Is there news on
the Nebraska acquisition?

01:02.628 --> 01:04.263
- Not yet.
- Okay.

01:04.296 --> 01:06.299
I'm gonna head up to Ronan.
Keep me posted.

01:07.599 --> 01:09.468
Thank you for the coffee.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.237
Good luck.

01:29.287 --> 01:30.789
Uh-huh.

01:32.691 --> 01:34.851
Yeah, might have to check that.
Let me get back to you.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.166
Depica is finalized.
Three days ahead of schedule.

01:40.198 --> 01:41.834
Nice job, Theodora.

01:44.802 --> 01:47.239
- Will there be anything else?
- No.

01:52.210 --> 01:53.787
Des Moines is still taking
the heat today.

01:53.811 --> 01:56.316
Nebraska just
will not play ball until we...

01:58.751 --> 02:01.454
Have you made those travel
arrangements yet?

02:06.325 --> 02:08.628
I'm assigning you
a sensitive project.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.764
Now, I assume you can handle it.

02:11.796 --> 02:14.667
You saved us time
on this Depica deal.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.501
So do you think you could use

02:16.534 --> 02:19.371
a little bit of that magic
on this one?

02:19.405 --> 02:23.876
Of course, you're the only one
that I can trust to do this

02:23.908 --> 02:25.844
this close to the holidays.

02:25.877 --> 02:28.847
I know you have nothing planned.

02:30.748 --> 02:32.418
When do I leave?

02:32.450 --> 02:34.387
Talk to Kelly.
He has all the arrangements.

02:34.419 --> 02:36.889
I have calls to make.
Off you go.

02:44.763 --> 02:46.799
"Kelly has the details."

02:47.566 --> 02:50.368
So apparently
you have the details?

02:50.401 --> 02:52.938
- I tried to tell you.
- I saw you do this.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.640
- Is that what it was?
- Yes.

02:54.673 --> 02:56.675
I thought you slept funny.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.477
No.

02:58.509 --> 03:02.215
Okay. So apparently he's sending
you to New Richmond.

03:02.848 --> 03:05.818
- New Richmond?
- The heart of it all.

03:05.850 --> 03:08.187
Ohio.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.957
So, I will send you everything
in an email.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.592
You have a rental car

03:12.625 --> 03:14.492
and a reservation for a B&B
for one night.

03:14.526 --> 03:16.362
And you need to leave now

03:16.395 --> 03:18.531
because your flight leaves
in two hours.

03:18.563 --> 03:19.563
Okay.

03:21.366 --> 03:22.401
Good luck.

04:12.383 --> 04:13.752
I'll be here if you need me.

04:57.963 --> 04:59.564
Vroom!

05:00.733 --> 05:02.334
Hey, my little copilot.

05:02.367 --> 05:05.771
Let's bake some more cookies.

05:14.779 --> 05:18.350
Hey, just wanted to let you know
I was here if you need any help.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.753
Where do you want these flowers?

05:20.786 --> 05:24.023
Thanks. Thank you, you can
just set them over there.

05:24.990 --> 05:28.694
Belinda is on her way.
She's bringing some pies.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.446
<i>She was like
a second mother to me.</i>

05:47.478 --> 05:49.748
She baked the best cookies
I ever had.

05:51.516 --> 05:54.052
I don't know if I can
appreciate another cookie again.

05:56.954 --> 05:57.954
Yeah.

05:59.190 --> 06:01.460
She's a good woman
and I'll miss her.

06:02.728 --> 06:04.864
Well, thank you guys

06:04.896 --> 06:08.468
for helping my mom around
the place while I was gone.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.702
I know it meant a lot to her.

06:13.204 --> 06:15.841
It's been a rough few months.
I'm glad you're back.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.511
Me too. We miss you, Charlie.

06:19.778 --> 06:20.847
Thank you.

06:33.891 --> 06:37.730
- Do you think he's gonna stay?
- Hope so.

06:38.930 --> 06:42.967
If he'd seen him like that...
I feel like I can't do anything.

06:43.999 --> 06:46.705
- He's not gonna listen to me.
- Yeah.

06:49.507 --> 06:50.742
I just don't know.

07:06.091 --> 07:09.528
You know Lila was
my best friend.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.430
And my cookie rival.

07:12.831 --> 07:14.900
It's hard for me to say this.

07:14.932 --> 07:18.704
But maybe this year I'll finally
win the cookie competition.

07:18.737 --> 07:21.040
This is going to be your year.

07:21.072 --> 07:22.674
Shh.

07:44.562 --> 07:46.031
That's bad timing.

07:51.235 --> 07:54.105
It's gonna be a different
cookie competition this year

07:54.139 --> 07:55.139
with Lila gone.

07:55.673 --> 07:58.911
Poor Charlie.
Just coming home and now this.

07:58.944 --> 08:02.014
You know, I used to check
her cookies twice

08:02.047 --> 08:03.983
to make sure they
weren't pure magic.

08:05.716 --> 08:08.019
It's truly sad to lose her
this close to Christmas.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.889
But, she's not...

08:17.295 --> 08:19.031
- Hello.
- Miss King?

08:19.064 --> 08:21.634
No, I'm Belinda. Come in.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.909
I'm looking for Miss Lila King.
Is she available?

08:31.209 --> 08:34.013
I'm sorry.
Lila is no longer here.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.115
Do you know when she'll be back?

08:37.916 --> 08:39.752
I'm sorry. You are?

08:39.784 --> 08:40.919
I'm Theodora Greenly.

08:41.787 --> 08:45.925
Miss Greenly. We laid Lila
to rest this morning.

08:48.693 --> 08:50.862
Maybe you'd like to speak
to her son, Charlie.

08:50.895 --> 08:52.730
He's back in town
taking care of things.

08:52.764 --> 08:55.567
- That'd be Charles King?
- Yes, Charlie.

08:57.068 --> 08:58.336
I heard my name?

08:58.370 --> 08:59.370
Charles King?

08:59.639 --> 09:02.073
- Yeah.
- I'm Theodora Greenly.

09:02.106 --> 09:05.745
I have an urgent matter.
Can we meet in private?

09:07.812 --> 09:10.348
You know what, it's kind of been
a long day for Charlie.

09:10.381 --> 09:13.785
Maybe you can give us a couple
hours just to get cleaned up

09:13.818 --> 09:15.654
and sorted out.

09:18.123 --> 09:19.825
I'll be back in two hours.

09:38.876 --> 09:40.912
I'm here if you need me.

09:52.289 --> 09:55.259
Your mother
was a wonderful soul.

09:55.293 --> 09:57.395
She was proud.

09:57.428 --> 10:00.331
Nick, butterscotch pie.

10:00.365 --> 10:02.334
Butterscotch, yeah.

10:02.366 --> 10:06.137
Bye, love.

10:06.171 --> 10:09.775
- I need 15 minutes.
- Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

10:09.807 --> 10:12.711
- Can I get you a coffee or?
- No, thanks.

10:17.182 --> 10:20.152
A transfer? Who?
What do you mean default?

10:20.184 --> 10:21.184
Again.

10:21.452 --> 10:24.288
My firm represents
River Hills Bank.

10:24.322 --> 10:28.293
I have a nonjudicial disclosure
of default on this prop...

10:28.326 --> 10:30.962
I heard what you said
but you've made some kind of...

10:30.995 --> 10:33.197
I need to finalize this transfer
immediately.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.908
You're kidding.
This is a joke. You're joking.

10:34.932 --> 10:37.836
Okay. Clearly,
you don't understand.

10:37.869 --> 10:39.672
I understand what you're saying.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.440
I'm telling you,
this is not possible.

10:41.472 --> 10:47.111
This house, this whole property,
falls under my firm's custody.

10:47.144 --> 10:49.380
It's my responsibility
to finalize this deal.

10:49.413 --> 10:51.216
What deal? There's no default.

10:51.249 --> 10:54.887
- You've made a mistake...
- You had a hard day.

10:56.221 --> 10:58.956
I'm going to give you some time
to figure this out.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.759
And I'll be back in the morning.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.173
She's a lot of fun.

11:18.509 --> 11:20.913
- She arrived...
- Papers signed.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.346
She just got there.

11:22.379 --> 11:27.253
She's been there for four hours,
35 minutes.

11:27.785 --> 11:29.854
I'll get in touch with Melissa.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.856
You do that.

11:34.826 --> 11:36.327
How's that?

11:36.360 --> 11:37.962
Fine quality bourbon.

11:39.264 --> 11:42.067
Hasn't been an
"Aaron wasted my time."

11:50.509 --> 11:52.878
Kathryn will be pleased.

11:52.910 --> 11:56.314
Is Kathryn ever pleased?

11:58.316 --> 11:59.951
Once or twice.

12:02.052 --> 12:04.255
Tell me more about Melissa.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.191
Oh, forget it.

12:06.224 --> 12:11.864
Theodora. She will not let you
get within 50 feet of Melissa.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.100
You speaking from experience?

12:15.966 --> 12:17.802
What time your train leave?

12:19.136 --> 12:20.238
Why?

12:20.272 --> 12:22.141
Why I thought we might

12:22.173 --> 12:24.744
get ourselves a couple more
pours of bourbon.

12:32.082 --> 12:35.420
Okay. Let's get back to Melissa.

12:35.854 --> 12:40.425
You know, I think
you're gonna have to figure out

12:40.457 --> 12:43.328
a way of asking her yourself.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.999
There should be something.
There's nothing saying

12:47.032 --> 12:48.400
she missed a single payment.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.873
Her records are perfect.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.008
She would never...

13:01.513 --> 13:02.815
foreclosure.

13:11.222 --> 13:14.058
Yo, I think I'm gonna hit
the diner for coffee.

13:14.091 --> 13:16.461
You're gonna be up all night.
I see you tomorrow.

13:16.494 --> 13:17.529
All right.

13:23.869 --> 13:27.239
- Hey.
- It's past your bedtime?

13:28.072 --> 13:29.173
This is rare.

13:29.206 --> 13:31.242
Jogging makes me thirsty.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.180
Hey, um, can I
get another cup of coffee?

13:36.881 --> 13:38.383
That'll keep you up all night.

13:41.119 --> 13:42.421
I have a lot of work to do.

13:43.922 --> 13:45.423
Didn't I see you
at Charlie King's?

13:45.456 --> 13:48.125
You sure did.
This is Theodora Greenly

13:48.158 --> 13:51.295
and this is Michael Strauss,
our resident physical therapist

13:51.328 --> 13:53.931
and running enthusiast.

13:53.965 --> 13:57.168
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Michael.

13:57.201 --> 13:59.403
I really do have
a lot of work to do, though.

13:59.437 --> 14:01.173
Understood.

14:01.206 --> 14:02.640
Enjoy your stay in New Richmond.

14:02.673 --> 14:04.175
I'm only here for one night.

14:05.543 --> 14:07.046
Thankfully.

14:32.003 --> 14:33.038
Hi.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.341
Do you need a moment?

14:36.674 --> 14:38.142
Um, no.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.312
Come in.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.356
I don't even know
what I'm looking for here.

14:53.524 --> 14:55.627
Let me explain this very simply.

14:58.495 --> 15:01.165
This loan is
in default of payment.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.503
We've sent multiple notices,

15:04.535 --> 15:07.038
and of this date,
the loan has not been satisfied.

15:08.974 --> 15:12.177
I'm sorry, this still doesn't
make sense to me at all.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.179
It means that the loan
has not been...

15:14.211 --> 15:16.280
I know what it means.
I'm telling you,

15:16.313 --> 15:19.050
my mother would
never default on this property.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.484
She loved this place.

15:20.518 --> 15:23.122
It was everything to her.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.557
I'm gonna need at least a day.

15:26.591 --> 15:29.995
I have to go to the bank
and get this figured out.

15:30.528 --> 15:32.431
You have until tomorrow morning.

15:32.464 --> 15:33.464
Fine.

15:48.145 --> 15:49.247
Let's get you up.

15:50.081 --> 15:52.017
I can't. I can't.

16:14.438 --> 16:17.208
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.243
Let me go see
if I can find some ice

16:19.277 --> 16:21.547
or a bandage or something.

16:22.179 --> 16:25.182
I have frozen peas,
works like ice.

16:25.216 --> 16:26.751
Just whatever.

16:26.784 --> 16:28.687
I used to use them
when I played sports.

16:39.230 --> 16:42.600
Okay, just get it on.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.370
That is really swelling.

16:48.807 --> 16:49.807
Oh, wow.

16:51.308 --> 16:53.278
You're gonna need
to see a doctor.

16:53.745 --> 16:56.548
No. No, it's gonna be okay.

16:56.581 --> 17:01.253
It's okay. I just, I just need
to keep it on ice for a bit.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.688
It will be fine.
It will be fine.

17:04.321 --> 17:08.526
No, you definitely need
to see a doctor for that.

17:08.559 --> 17:10.327
I can take care of it myself.

17:10.361 --> 17:12.431
It's probably for that too.

17:12.463 --> 17:14.165
Give me that!

17:18.836 --> 17:21.405
Hey, doc,
I'm glad you picked up.

17:21.439 --> 17:26.778
Look, I have a guest.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.080
She, she sprained her ankle.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.682
I don't think it's broken.
But it was really bad.

17:34.384 --> 17:37.288
Really, okay. Think you'll be
able to bring some crutches?

17:37.321 --> 17:38.423
I don't need crutches!

17:39.490 --> 17:41.425
Great. Okay, thank you.

17:41.459 --> 17:42.628
Thank you. Yeah, bye.

17:43.827 --> 17:45.364
Okay, so.

17:47.164 --> 17:50.402
The doc says it's just, for now,
to keep your ankle elevated.

17:50.434 --> 17:51.470
But...

17:53.471 --> 17:57.576
he also said you're probably not
going anywhere for a few days.

17:57.608 --> 18:00.144
What? I'm not saying here.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.614
I'm gonna...

18:02.646 --> 18:03.814
I'll be just fine.

18:03.847 --> 18:04.847
I...

18:05.584 --> 18:07.719
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

18:10.188 --> 18:11.690
I can take care of this.

18:11.722 --> 18:13.658
I'll be okay. Yeah.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.496
You know, everybody needs
a little help sometimes.

18:22.432 --> 18:26.872
And, I know you
don't want to stay here.

18:26.904 --> 18:29.540
I'm not really
excited about it either.

18:29.574 --> 18:31.677
So why don't we try
to make the best of it?

18:34.278 --> 18:36.682
You want some coffee?

18:45.256 --> 18:46.256
Black.

18:51.962 --> 18:53.764
Do you have any super glue?

19:15.752 --> 19:17.755
- Hey, Don Juan.
- What?

19:17.788 --> 19:19.723
Big sparks with you
and the city girl.

19:19.757 --> 19:21.759
She staying at your place?

19:21.792 --> 19:23.961
She had a bad fall,
sprained her ankle.

19:23.994 --> 19:26.263
Hopefully, she'll be gone
in a few days.

19:26.297 --> 19:27.798
Sprain. Is it severe?

19:27.832 --> 19:29.201
Doc says it's mild.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.803
- Sprain or not, she's hot.
- Is she?

19:33.938 --> 19:35.174
You didn't notice?

19:36.807 --> 19:39.211
Hot or not,
she's trying to take my farm.

19:40.778 --> 19:43.914
Take your farm? How?
What do you mean take?

19:43.948 --> 19:46.685
Why don't you swing by
some time, I'll catch you up.

19:46.718 --> 19:47.885
Deal.

19:52.856 --> 19:55.326
Finally. Are you okay?

19:55.359 --> 19:56.727
It's not good.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.462
It always gets bad
before it gets better.

19:58.496 --> 20:00.365
Yeah, they have me on crutches.

20:00.397 --> 20:02.733
I have an appointment
with the doc in the morning

20:02.767 --> 20:05.304
before I go to the bank.
So we'll see.

20:05.770 --> 20:08.839
Ronan's pissed, and Kelly's
taking the brunt of it.

20:08.873 --> 20:10.709
I don't know how he does it.

20:10.741 --> 20:13.278
You know, I've had a chance
to look through those files

20:13.310 --> 20:15.746
and I can see why Charles
is confused about this.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.682
Anything I can do to help?

20:17.714 --> 20:19.984
So, about Charles?

20:20.018 --> 20:21.252
What?

20:21.286 --> 20:22.354
Is he cute?

20:22.386 --> 20:23.387
Goodbye, Melissa.

20:23.421 --> 20:24.990
- Wait.
- <i>Yes?</i>

20:25.022 --> 20:26.625
Is that a yes?

20:26.657 --> 20:27.657
Goodbye.

20:32.763 --> 20:35.266
<i>- I knew it!
- Knew what?</i>

20:36.034 --> 20:38.403
Is that the New Richmond deal?

20:38.435 --> 20:41.705
Sure is. You need to read it
and Theodora needs to see it.

20:41.739 --> 20:44.776
Are you sure? You could lose
your job over this?

20:44.808 --> 20:45.876
I'm counting on it.

20:46.644 --> 20:47.645
I'm done.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.550
Oh, yeah. And, Jagger Huntley.

20:53.584 --> 20:55.254
Say no more.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.360
Mr. Mayor.

21:02.393 --> 21:04.696
Do you really eat all
your broccoli?

21:04.729 --> 21:08.500
I sure do.
It's my favorite vegetable.

21:08.532 --> 21:10.601
Well, you know
what that makes you?

21:10.634 --> 21:11.836
A really good girl?

21:11.868 --> 21:14.905
No. Someone who likes broccoli.

21:15.807 --> 21:18.643
You're funny.

21:18.675 --> 21:20.311
Isn't he, daddy?

21:20.345 --> 21:21.779
Yes, he is, Molly.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.950
- Well, we better get going.
- Have a good day.

21:26.651 --> 21:28.353
Put your jacket on, kiddo.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.355
Got it?

21:30.387 --> 21:31.622
All right. Awesome.

21:32.757 --> 21:34.491
That's for you.

21:34.525 --> 21:36.861
- Thank you.
- There you go. Enjoy.

21:36.894 --> 21:39.364
- Have a good night.
- You too. Nice seeing you.

21:39.396 --> 21:40.398
Bye, Nick.

21:48.138 --> 21:49.773
Still gonna check
on Charlie tomorrow?

21:49.807 --> 21:50.807
Yes, ma'am.

21:52.442 --> 21:53.944
You're gonna ask him

21:53.978 --> 21:56.548
about Lila's recipe
and the cookie competition?

21:56.580 --> 21:57.615
Of course.

21:58.982 --> 22:00.018
Mr. Snow,

22:00.550 --> 22:04.388
when you have a piece of my pie
under your nose,

22:04.422 --> 22:07.491
you are a man of few words.

22:07.525 --> 22:09.694
Look, I will do
what I can. Okay?

22:09.727 --> 22:11.696
But he has to make
his own decision.

22:11.729 --> 22:13.365
I believe in you.

22:14.132 --> 22:16.101
You always know
the right thing to say.

22:16.601 --> 22:19.904
- Oh, hello Seth. Coffee?
- Another piece of pie?

22:19.936 --> 22:21.605
You keep eating my pie

22:21.638 --> 22:23.107
and you're gonna
look like Santa.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.676
Is that a bad thing?

22:36.186 --> 22:37.355
A tree?

22:38.556 --> 22:39.790
It's a fire hazard.

22:44.694 --> 22:45.830
It's fine.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.478
Is this the only bag
you brought?

23:00.510 --> 23:02.110
I was only supposed
to be here one night.

23:02.446 --> 23:04.415
So you don't have
any warm clothes?

23:04.981 --> 23:06.151
One night.

23:08.685 --> 23:09.887
Okay.

23:13.990 --> 23:17.461
Okay, so I have some flannels
and warm socks.

23:17.494 --> 23:19.106
They're clean.
You're welcome to wear them.

23:19.130 --> 23:22.734
Those are great. Did they come
with a free moose?

23:24.501 --> 23:26.805
Okay, look. I'm really trying
to be nice. Okay?

23:26.837 --> 23:29.840
It's really cold out there.
It can get a lot colder in here.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.610
You're welcome.

23:59.769 --> 24:02.606
You're going to decorate
the whole house?

24:02.640 --> 24:04.209
- Yes.
- Why?

24:05.910 --> 24:07.211
Because it's Christmas.

24:07.244 --> 24:09.548
Then you just take
it all down again.

24:24.961 --> 24:25.997
Oh, wow.

24:30.701 --> 24:34.105
This... This was
my favorite ornament as a kid.

24:35.573 --> 24:37.542
It's not a Christmas ornament.

24:40.010 --> 24:42.747
- Of course it's an ornament.
- No.

24:43.146 --> 24:46.183
There's no red ribbon on it.
There's no glitter.

24:46.217 --> 24:48.786
Even though I hate glitter,
it goes everywhere.

24:48.818 --> 24:50.754
There's no etching,
there's no design.

24:50.788 --> 24:52.223
It's not a Christmas ornament.

25:00.163 --> 25:02.867
Christmas, 1988.

25:03.901 --> 25:05.737
It's an ornament.

25:13.743 --> 25:15.846
Oh, is that a Christmas blanket?

25:17.048 --> 25:20.218
The more you decorate, the
stronger the Christmas spirit.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.753
- Oh...
- Don't do it.

25:25.323 --> 25:27.559
You're sure your last name
isn't Dickens?

25:31.295 --> 25:37.067
<i>♪ Let every heart

25:37.101 --> 25:40.071
<i>♪ And heaven and nature sing

25:40.104 --> 25:42.273

25:48.112 --> 25:52.750

25:52.782 --> 25:54.885
Beautiful.

25:54.919 --> 25:58.123
- Stunning. Absolutely stunning.
- Of course.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.760
So. Do you have any other songs?
Do you know what?

26:02.792 --> 26:05.796
It doesn't matter.
You guys sound fabu...

26:05.829 --> 26:07.965
That was fantastic.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.200
Nice job.

26:10.067 --> 26:11.603
Hey, Mr. Mayor.

26:11.635 --> 26:13.203
- Hello.
- Don't you think we need some

26:13.237 --> 26:14.906
- decorations...
- There's...

26:15.439 --> 26:18.276
gonna be more decorations.
They're just not up yet.

26:18.308 --> 26:20.744
Don't you have somewhere
to be today?

26:20.778 --> 26:22.279
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

26:22.313 --> 26:24.349
Yeah. Thirty minutes.
I got an appointment.

26:24.382 --> 26:27.085
Mayor Langford. Sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

26:27.117 --> 26:29.354
No, nothing at all.

26:29.386 --> 26:31.054
Great.

26:31.087 --> 26:33.891
I just wondering, what are
your expectations for us

26:33.923 --> 26:35.792
during the Christmas Eve event?

26:35.826 --> 26:38.229
Absolutely. What we're going
to do is have carolers inside,

26:38.261 --> 26:41.732
and we'll have carolers outside
drawing people to the event.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.634
So the same thing
we did last year?

26:43.667 --> 26:45.369
Yes. But with a twist.

26:45.403 --> 26:47.270
This year, randomly,

26:47.304 --> 26:50.175
the carolers should
throw out candy.

26:51.842 --> 26:54.846
- That's a twist.
- Yes!

26:54.878 --> 26:57.347
We're gonna go back to
rehearsing if that's cool.

26:57.381 --> 27:03.054
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.
You sound wonderful. Thank you!

27:03.753 --> 27:09.192
<i>♪ Joy to the world
The Lord has come ♪</i>

27:09.226 --> 27:13.164
<i>♪ Let Earth receive her king ♪</i>

27:13.196 --> 27:15.098
I'm sorry.

27:15.132 --> 27:17.301
Sorry. Sorry.

27:17.334 --> 27:20.171
It's okay. It's all right.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.440
First time on crutches.

27:22.472 --> 27:23.707
It's okay.

27:25.942 --> 27:27.045
You missed a button.

27:44.194 --> 27:45.762
Hey, Michael.

27:45.796 --> 27:47.097
Nice tree.

27:47.131 --> 27:48.867
Thanks. Nick sure knows
how to pick 'em.

27:49.967 --> 27:51.469
Hey, have you had breakfast?

27:51.501 --> 27:53.870
I did. I definitely
don't need more coffee.

27:53.903 --> 27:55.772
Oh, there's always room for pie.

27:55.806 --> 27:58.409
Not this morning. I made
an omelet bigger than my head.

27:58.442 --> 28:00.745
Ate at all.

28:00.778 --> 28:03.881
Have you spoken to Charlie
since the funeral?

28:03.913 --> 28:06.750
Briefly yesterday. I'm going
to the farm this evening.

28:06.784 --> 28:08.419
You want to take a pie?

28:08.451 --> 28:10.721
- No, I'm taking beers.
- Oh.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.124
Hey, have you ever
made a pie of stout?

28:13.156 --> 28:15.793
- Keep decorating.
- You are the smart one.

28:16.326 --> 28:19.730
Go easy on him.
He's got a lot to handle.

28:19.763 --> 28:22.099
- I mean it.
- Yeah. For sure.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.468
- It's good to see you.
- Okay.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.135
- See you, Mike.
- See you, Mike.

28:27.938 --> 28:32.210
This looks so nice.
Little Santas.

28:32.242 --> 28:35.746
They're so like you, Nick.
Look at that.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.319
If you're entering
the competition

28:41.352 --> 28:44.288
that your mother always won
then you just use her recipe.

28:45.823 --> 28:48.259
Well, that's the mystery.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.227
I don't know where she left it.

28:51.295 --> 28:53.831
I thought country women
always kept

28:53.864 --> 28:55.533
little boxes
with the recipes in them

28:55.566 --> 28:57.402
to give to the next generation.

29:00.104 --> 29:01.439
She did.

29:11.248 --> 29:12.817
It's not in there.

29:16.053 --> 29:17.288
May I?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.490
Please do.

29:26.096 --> 29:27.397
Moon pie.

29:28.030 --> 29:30.067
Was your mom's
as good as Belinda's?

29:32.970 --> 29:34.404
Mom was a cookie baker.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.844
Quintessential Waldorf salad.

29:44.114 --> 29:46.083
Sweet potato casserole.

29:46.115 --> 29:47.519
That was in her top three.

29:47.951 --> 29:50.421
See, now you're going to go
and make me hungry.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.493
It's just amazing

29:56.527 --> 30:00.064
how many stories
this little box can hold.

30:05.102 --> 30:07.338
Oh, I went to the bank today,
by the way.

30:08.105 --> 30:09.140
Yeah?

30:10.340 --> 30:12.409
Did you figure anything out?

30:12.442 --> 30:14.144
No.

30:17.548 --> 30:19.349
Expecting company?

30:20.951 --> 30:23.487
- The doctor maybe?
- No.

30:23.519 --> 30:25.323
I have an appointment tomorrow.

30:29.359 --> 30:31.061
- Are you going to get it?
- Yeah.

30:50.681 --> 30:52.517
Hey, Michael.

30:53.983 --> 30:55.619
Hi, buddy.

30:55.653 --> 30:58.456
You said to stop for a beer.
Northern Row, your favorite.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.392
Yeah, I did say that, didn't I.
Come on in.

31:11.669 --> 31:14.605
Ah. So we meet again.

31:16.205 --> 31:17.641
Meet again?

31:17.674 --> 31:20.010
Pleasure,
to officially meet you.

31:21.144 --> 31:24.548
Well, I did hear you had two
broken ribs and a broken leg.

31:27.818 --> 31:30.354
I heard it's just a sprain,
that's a rumor mill.

31:30.386 --> 31:31.422
Right, Charlie?

31:32.388 --> 31:33.590
Yep.

31:33.624 --> 31:35.526
So, how's the ankle?

31:37.193 --> 31:38.261
Um.

31:38.295 --> 31:40.932
It's healing nicely, I think.

31:41.766 --> 31:45.670
Well, I'm a physical therapist.
If I can help you in any way...

31:45.702 --> 31:47.372
Let me know. Right, Charl?

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
Yeah.

31:57.347 --> 31:58.482
Okay.

32:00.651 --> 32:04.188
Well, I think I'm going
to call it a night.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.457
Do you need some help?

32:06.490 --> 32:09.027
Oh, no, thanks. I got this.

32:15.766 --> 32:17.101
Goodnight, Charles.

32:19.635 --> 32:21.471
Oh, thanks for the beer.

32:29.046 --> 32:32.450
Did I interrupt something?

32:32.482 --> 32:35.720
No. Why would you
even think that?

32:36.019 --> 32:37.687
I've seen that look.

32:37.721 --> 32:40.157
- What look?
- You know.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.468
I miss your mom.

32:52.301 --> 32:55.072
Remember how she used to hum
when she baked cookies?

32:57.775 --> 32:58.775
Yeah.

33:00.576 --> 33:03.614
She could barely make them fast
enough to keep up with us.

33:05.715 --> 33:07.317
What was that song?

33:08.585 --> 33:10.188
Frosty the Snowman.

33:11.422 --> 33:13.725
- Frosting the Snow...
- Frosty.

33:14.490 --> 33:15.593
You don't listen.

33:17.361 --> 33:20.298
Wow. I was joking.

33:21.031 --> 33:23.300
You're the one who
doesn't like to listen.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.076
Right. So you want
to do this now?

33:33.109 --> 33:35.479
I think that we should.
It's time.

33:38.315 --> 33:39.315
You...

33:41.417 --> 33:43.219
You walked out
on our friendship.

33:43.252 --> 33:46.589
- Over a simple misunderstanding.
- Simple...

33:46.623 --> 33:49.027
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

33:51.161 --> 33:54.698
You should have known
I would never do that to you.

33:54.730 --> 33:56.634
I should have known.

33:57.367 --> 34:01.538
You were talking to her
every single chance you got.

34:01.571 --> 34:04.107
I talked to everyone, Charlie.

34:04.141 --> 34:05.643
And you never
said you liked her.

34:05.675 --> 34:07.845
It's that move that you do.

34:07.877 --> 34:09.447
What move?

34:09.480 --> 34:11.248
You did it tonight to Theodora.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.518
That? That's not a move.
That's a Michael thing.

34:14.550 --> 34:15.550
That's a me thing.

34:16.253 --> 34:19.757
And making assumptions.
That's a Charlie.

34:19.789 --> 34:21.425
You were like that
when we were kids.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.559
When will you learn?

34:22.592 --> 34:24.627
So this is all my fault?

34:24.661 --> 34:28.199
No, it's both of our faults.
You're the one who left.

34:28.231 --> 34:30.166
You didn't care about
our friendship enough

34:30.199 --> 34:31.634
to see it from my side.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.605
From your side.
What about my side, Michael?

34:35.405 --> 34:38.843
Yeah. I see things from my side.
That's a Charlie thing.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.115
And here we are again.

34:45.882 --> 34:48.885
- You're falling for Theodora.
- No, I'm not.

34:48.918 --> 34:49.918
You are.

34:51.521 --> 34:53.224
Even if I were,

34:53.257 --> 34:55.358
why would you be hitting on her
in front of me?

34:55.391 --> 34:57.427
Is it just to prove
that you can?

34:57.460 --> 35:00.830
Are you kidding me? I'm being
friendly. It's who I am.

35:00.864 --> 35:02.800
I'm not interested in her.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.735
Don't do this again.

35:06.836 --> 35:08.838
- You're falling for her.
- No, I'm not.

35:08.871 --> 35:09.871
You are.

35:11.775 --> 35:14.479
- I can't.
- Well, you are.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.900
Something is missing.

35:38.467 --> 35:40.637
Hey, look at you.

35:41.605 --> 35:43.407
You look 100% better.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.242
Yeah, the swelling's actually
gone down a whole bunch.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.846
It looks a lot worse
than it feels. So, it's good.

35:50.514 --> 35:52.182
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

35:52.215 --> 35:55.219
How about coffee and a cookie?

35:55.251 --> 35:57.154
The cookies smell
really, really good.

35:58.487 --> 36:00.790
It's a very nice apron, Charles.

36:02.626 --> 36:04.195
It's very festive.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.164
Thank you.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.298
It was my mom's.

36:09.632 --> 36:11.735
Please call me Charlie.

36:15.606 --> 36:18.809
You know, I think this country
air is doing you some good.

36:18.842 --> 36:21.345
I haven't seen you this relaxed
since I met you.

36:23.780 --> 36:25.449
Maybe it's the cookies.

36:26.682 --> 36:28.485
I don't think so.

36:28.518 --> 36:31.355
Can't get the recipe right.
There's something missing.

36:35.358 --> 36:36.927
They smell like a winner to me.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.996
Something about the way
my mom made them,

36:40.030 --> 36:41.432
I just cannot duplicate.

36:43.266 --> 36:44.734
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

36:46.570 --> 36:49.707
Shoot. I've gotta go. I've got
an appointment with the doc.

36:49.739 --> 36:51.541
Oh, hey, wait.

36:51.574 --> 36:53.543
I was looking
over the paperwork,

36:53.577 --> 36:55.846
and Helena Corrival's name

36:55.878 --> 36:58.315
is associated
with my mom's account.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.750
Yeah, well, she probably
handled the mortgage, so.

37:00.784 --> 37:03.387
I got to go.
I'll see you in a bit though.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.755
- Well, can I drive you?
- No, thank you. I got it.

37:27.777 --> 37:30.647
Let's put the presents to
the right of the tree right now.

37:30.681 --> 37:32.682
Please. Thank you. Thank you.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.789
I know we said we
need more lights there.

37:39.822 --> 37:42.859
But we're going to need
more lights here actually.

37:42.893 --> 37:43.893
Oh.

37:45.961 --> 37:49.532
I think we should put
garland over the doors.

37:49.565 --> 37:50.833
And tinsel.

37:50.867 --> 37:52.803
Like tinsel everywhere.
More tinsel.

37:52.835 --> 37:55.872
Because it's almost
time for old St. Nick.

37:55.905 --> 37:57.740
Hey.

37:57.773 --> 38:00.510
You really got it going on. It's
like the north pole in here.

38:00.543 --> 38:02.578
- Yes.
- Oh, hey.

38:02.612 --> 38:05.014
Here comes Christmas.

38:05.047 --> 38:06.816
Yeah, we're good there.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.018
We're gonna put
the raffle tables over there.

38:09.052 --> 38:11.021
We're gonna put
the cookie competition table

38:11.054 --> 38:13.490
next to the tree and...

38:13.523 --> 38:15.793
Have you spoken to Charlie yet?

38:15.826 --> 38:16.860
Yeah, it's...

38:18.394 --> 38:20.563
Do you want the
mistletoe in all the doors?

38:20.597 --> 38:21.665
Oh, yes, absolutely.

38:21.697 --> 38:23.067
I think we should have it

38:23.099 --> 38:25.101
and it will make it
look so festive now.

38:25.135 --> 38:26.870
- Great.
- Thank you.

38:26.902 --> 38:27.937
So...

38:44.621 --> 38:46.056
Yes, I had some questions

38:46.088 --> 38:48.458
regarding the foreclosure
on the King home.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.461
Such a shame Lila became ill

38:50.494 --> 38:52.829
and was unable to keep up
with the payments.

38:52.862 --> 38:55.565
I've gone over the paperwork
many times.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.035
Weren't you
and Mrs. King friends?

38:58.068 --> 39:01.372
Yes. Well, until it came
to the cookie competition,

39:01.405 --> 39:03.707
then it's
everyone for themselves.

39:03.739 --> 39:05.708
This year may just be my year.

39:05.742 --> 39:07.044
I see.

39:07.077 --> 39:08.579
About the King account.

39:09.646 --> 39:11.349
How is your leg?

39:11.981 --> 39:12.981
Ankle.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.119
It's better. Thank you.

39:15.152 --> 39:17.420
I heard it was your leg.

39:18.221 --> 39:21.492
The paperwork. I expected
to pick that up today.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.626
Our system was down.

39:25.528 --> 39:27.130
Your system was down.

39:28.632 --> 39:30.800
So once your system
comes back online,

39:30.833 --> 39:33.903
I can expect you to email
that file to me immediately?

39:33.936 --> 39:36.072
Certainly, whatever you need.

39:36.972 --> 39:39.677
I appreciate your prompt
attention to this matter.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.613
I'll be in touch.

39:50.119 --> 39:52.121
Would you like to
take one of my cookies

39:52.155 --> 39:53.691
with you on your way out?

39:57.226 --> 39:58.495
I'd be delighted.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.210
Do you need a taste tester?

40:13.242 --> 40:15.578
Yes. Be honest.

40:16.112 --> 40:17.748
These look amazing.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.083
This is definitely going to be
your year.

40:49.112 --> 40:50.548
Have any milk?

41:03.126 --> 41:05.829
- I didn't hear the door?
- I came down the chimney.

41:07.597 --> 41:09.108
Just dropping by.
They want me to check on you.

41:09.132 --> 41:11.068
I promised your mom,
I'd look in on you

41:11.101 --> 41:13.204
and I know you got
a lot on your mind now.

41:14.304 --> 41:15.771
I'm okay.

41:15.804 --> 41:18.040
I heard the big city
businesswoman

41:18.074 --> 41:19.742
has been staying here.

41:19.775 --> 41:22.480
What, she like broke her leg
and a rib or two?

41:23.079 --> 41:25.848
Theodora.
It's just a bad sprain.

41:25.882 --> 41:28.684
The New Richmond
rumor mill, man.

41:28.717 --> 41:30.152
Someone gets a splinter,

41:30.186 --> 41:32.588
they turn it into someone
needing brain surgery.

41:32.621 --> 41:35.192
It's one of the many things
I missed while I was away.

41:37.626 --> 41:39.630
Are you planning on staying,
Charlie?

41:43.099 --> 41:45.135
If I don't lose the property.

41:45.168 --> 41:47.805
How is that with the enemy
staying right here?

41:49.773 --> 41:52.742
It was pretty rough at first.

41:52.775 --> 41:55.078
She's warming up. I think.

41:55.746 --> 41:58.115
It doesn't hurt
that she's easy on the eye.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.150
- Stop.
- Looking. Hey.

42:00.182 --> 42:02.119
You know,
maybe you're both changing.

42:02.152 --> 42:05.255
Listen to her. Okay, she might
be able to help you out.

42:06.590 --> 42:09.660
So, how's that cookie recipe
coming?

42:09.693 --> 42:11.961
It's good. It's good.
It's not perfect.

42:11.994 --> 42:13.996
Well, your mom
would be proud of you

42:14.030 --> 42:15.865
entering the cookie competition.

42:15.898 --> 42:19.737
Well, I haven't entered yet.
There's still something missing.

42:20.536 --> 42:24.040
You know, every recipe she ever
had, right there in that box.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.043
Everything but the cookies.

42:26.076 --> 42:29.045
So, I'm just trying to
remember the best I can.

42:29.079 --> 42:31.715
You will figure it out.
I have every faith.

42:32.614 --> 42:35.651
Look, I got to go.
Lots of stops to make, but...

42:35.684 --> 42:37.086
Oh, hey.

42:37.820 --> 42:40.590
That was always your mom's
favorite photo of you.

42:42.157 --> 42:43.693
I'll see you, Charlie.

42:43.726 --> 42:44.795
Take care.

42:47.664 --> 42:50.934
Charlie, hello. How are you?

42:50.967 --> 42:52.336
I'm well. Thanks.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.605
Is there anything
I can do for you?

42:54.637 --> 42:57.607
Yeah, actually, I was in
the bank yesterday trying

42:57.641 --> 42:59.675
to get some information
on mom's account.

42:59.708 --> 43:02.011
We've been having problems
with our system,

43:02.045 --> 43:05.382
but I doubt they give you access
without power of attorney.

43:05.414 --> 43:07.918
It's out of my hands.
I'm so sorry.

43:07.951 --> 43:10.052
It's all right.
I'll figure something out.

43:10.085 --> 43:12.755
I heard you haven't entered
the cookie competition.

43:12.789 --> 43:14.358
Well, I...

43:14.391 --> 43:16.960
Don't wait long. You don't
want to miss the deadline.

43:16.992 --> 43:19.195
The prize is $10,000,

43:19.228 --> 43:24.333
and an interview on <i>The Greatest
Cookie Ever</i> television show.

43:24.367 --> 43:26.370
That's the reason
for the new hairstyle.

43:26.402 --> 43:28.871
I plan to win this year.

43:28.905 --> 43:30.374
Well, you look very nice.

43:30.407 --> 43:32.742
Well, thank you, Charlie.
I wish you the best.

43:48.090 --> 43:49.092
Hi there.

43:52.862 --> 43:54.731
Wow.

43:54.764 --> 43:57.067
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sorry. Thank you.

44:00.103 --> 44:01.871
Are you, um...

44:01.905 --> 44:03.440
- New boots?
- Oh.

44:03.472 --> 44:05.074
Both feet even.

44:05.108 --> 44:07.310
Yeah. The doctor thought

44:07.342 --> 44:09.812
that something
with a lower shoe would help.

44:10.713 --> 44:12.081
What about this?

44:12.114 --> 44:14.050
Oh, just around town.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.818
I don't need to wear it at home.

44:15.851 --> 44:16.886
Home?

44:19.255 --> 44:22.992
Your home. I don't need
to wear it at your home or...

44:23.025 --> 44:24.827
my feet for very long.

44:24.860 --> 44:26.096
I gotcha. Yeah.

44:27.831 --> 44:30.000
Well, that's good news.

44:30.032 --> 44:32.201
Celebrate?
Can I treat you to lunch?

44:33.068 --> 44:35.471
I'm going on cookies
and coffee here. So yeah.

44:35.505 --> 44:37.140
Sounds good.

44:37.172 --> 44:39.709
Well, the diner here has um,

44:39.742 --> 44:42.679
a great meatloaf special,
amazing pies?

44:43.313 --> 44:44.881
Sounds good.

44:44.914 --> 44:46.182
Are you okay to walk?

44:46.215 --> 44:48.085
I think so.

44:54.224 --> 44:57.494
This is such a, it's such
a beautiful little town.

44:57.527 --> 45:00.963
It is charming without being
too touristy. You know?

45:00.996 --> 45:02.865
It's a town that's just enough.

45:02.898 --> 45:04.201
Oh, I like that.

45:06.335 --> 45:07.370
Yeah?

45:12.775 --> 45:15.215
Is it because you're a writer
you can come up with that stuff?

45:23.286 --> 45:26.456
This place reminds
me of when I was a kid.

45:26.489 --> 45:28.157
Look at the pies.

45:28.190 --> 45:29.893
Do you have a favorite?

45:29.925 --> 45:31.260
All of them.

45:32.896 --> 45:36.099
Oh, look who's having
a lunch date.

45:36.132 --> 45:38.268
It's not a date.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.036
Really? Well, okay.

45:41.070 --> 45:43.440
- Belinda is a bit of a talker.
- Mm-hmm.

45:43.472 --> 45:47.076
I call it as I see it.
When's your birthday?

45:47.110 --> 45:49.412
I'm a Leo if
that's what you're asking.

45:49.445 --> 45:52.816
A Leo and a Sage.
Oh, that's a nice pairing.

45:53.983 --> 45:56.186
- I already know what I want.
- Okay.

45:56.753 --> 45:59.155
Charles has sold me on
the meatloaf special.

46:00.123 --> 46:04.293
I've known Charlie a long time,
and I can read his mind.

46:04.327 --> 46:06.229
That's two specials coming up.

46:06.262 --> 46:07.330
Thank you. Oh!

46:07.362 --> 46:10.533
A chocolate pecan for me and?

46:10.567 --> 46:13.103
- Dutch apple cranberry?
- Okay.

46:16.005 --> 46:18.375
- So...
- So you...

46:18.407 --> 46:20.243
Sorry, you go ahead.

46:21.210 --> 46:23.546
You said this place
brings back memories?

46:23.579 --> 46:26.882
Yeah. When I was a kid,

46:26.916 --> 46:28.585
and I wasn't traveling
with my dad,

46:28.617 --> 46:30.453
I used to stay
with my grandparents.

46:32.021 --> 46:34.257
They were bakers,
they loved to bake pies.

46:34.289 --> 46:36.559
They had their own specialty
they would make,

46:36.592 --> 46:40.362
and give it out to neighbors
and friends and stuff. But...

46:40.396 --> 46:43.033
I was never much of a baker.

46:43.065 --> 46:45.601
So they made me
the official pie taster.

46:49.005 --> 46:50.173
I don't know. I just...

46:51.940 --> 46:54.910
It was more about just being
around them. You know?

46:54.943 --> 46:56.980
Watching them work.
It was magic.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.150
They were so in love.

47:04.186 --> 47:05.588
Sounds wonderful.

47:07.422 --> 47:10.626
They passed
when I was in college.

47:10.659 --> 47:13.362
We lost my mom
when I was really young,

47:13.396 --> 47:15.432
in case you were wondering.

47:15.465 --> 47:18.201
I was curious.

47:18.233 --> 47:20.203
- What about your father?
- No.

47:20.969 --> 47:22.471
He's all business.

47:23.338 --> 47:27.076
People say that he was different
before my mom passed but...

47:29.112 --> 47:32.316
I cannot picture that man in
anything but a business suit.

47:35.451 --> 47:38.387
The way you talk
about your grandparents,

47:38.420 --> 47:41.490
it reminds me of how I feel
about my mother and her cookies.

47:45.061 --> 47:47.898
All right folks. Here you go.

47:47.931 --> 47:49.932
- Thank you.
- Great.

47:49.965 --> 47:51.300
Do you need extra gravy on that?

47:51.333 --> 47:53.135
No, this looks delicious.

47:53.168 --> 47:55.337
It's so good
you'll want to move here.

47:55.371 --> 47:57.106
Don't you have
something else to do?

47:57.139 --> 47:58.974
Of course.

47:59.007 --> 48:00.676
Sorry about that.

48:00.710 --> 48:02.945
Not necessary.
It's very entertaining.

48:02.978 --> 48:04.146
I like you.

48:07.382 --> 48:09.585
She, she actually
really is great.

48:09.619 --> 48:12.555
She's kind of like
that crazy you know,

48:12.588 --> 48:16.192
that shows up unexpectedly,
throws you a party just because.

48:16.224 --> 48:18.494
She actually did
that for you didn't she?

48:19.161 --> 48:20.696
She did.

48:20.730 --> 48:22.365
After my father left.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.102
I'll never forget it.

48:26.135 --> 48:28.405
- It takes a special person.
- Mm-hmm.

48:30.139 --> 48:32.242
Well, I have not
taken a bite yet

48:32.275 --> 48:34.376
but I can tell you
that you were right.

48:34.409 --> 48:36.578
And this is the best meatloaf
I've ever had.

48:36.612 --> 48:38.148
Oh, just wait.

48:57.532 --> 49:01.203
Oh, I can't believe she's
staying at the house with him.

49:01.237 --> 49:03.005
That's so bizarre.

49:03.905 --> 49:06.543
Not really. They're actually
perfect for each other.

49:06.576 --> 49:07.711
They just can't see it.

49:09.579 --> 49:13.750
Wait. Do I sense potential
for intervening on his behalf?

49:13.782 --> 49:14.782
Me?

49:15.684 --> 49:17.420
Stop.

49:17.452 --> 49:19.255
I know you better
than you think.

49:21.356 --> 49:24.460
Michael the magnificent.

49:24.494 --> 49:27.163
That... I will agree with you.

49:28.931 --> 49:32.301
Somebody needs to intervene.
It might as well be me.

49:34.269 --> 49:37.606
It won't work.
You better be careful.

49:37.639 --> 49:39.509
You remember
what happened last time.

49:42.545 --> 49:44.414
Just be cautious, man.

49:45.380 --> 49:46.615
He's been through a lot.

49:47.750 --> 49:49.753
And don't push too hard.

49:56.458 --> 49:57.626
One more lap?

49:59.295 --> 50:00.630
Loser buys coffee.

50:09.172 --> 50:11.574
- Here you go.
- Oh, wow, that looks amazing.

50:11.606 --> 50:15.045
Pies compliments of Grace Tilly.
She's treating everyone.

50:15.077 --> 50:16.813
Ice cream is on me.

50:16.846 --> 50:19.715
- Thank you so much, Grace.
- Oh, my pleasure, darling.

50:20.449 --> 50:24.553
She gets really excited this
time of year. Enjoy every bite.

50:24.586 --> 50:26.389
Let me know
what you think of that crust?

50:26.422 --> 50:27.624
- I will.
- All right.

50:27.657 --> 50:28.657
Thank you.

50:30.293 --> 50:32.295
New Richmond loves
this time of year.

50:34.697 --> 50:36.532
I do too.

50:39.702 --> 50:40.702
It must be...

50:41.503 --> 50:45.074
especially hard on you then just
considering your circumstances.

50:49.211 --> 50:50.211
Yeah, well.

50:52.715 --> 50:54.084
How about that crust?

50:54.117 --> 50:55.385
Really good.

50:57.786 --> 51:00.089
- So you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

51:00.123 --> 51:01.490
I'm gonna pick up a few things.

51:01.523 --> 51:03.326
And then I'll meet you
back at home.

51:04.159 --> 51:05.661
At your house.

51:06.262 --> 51:08.498
I'm gonna meet
you back in your house.

51:09.431 --> 51:12.835
Well, my plan is to work on
the recipe tonight after dinner.

51:12.869 --> 51:16.273
Would you want to be
my official taste tester?

51:17.340 --> 51:18.508
Absolutely, I would.

51:19.574 --> 51:22.344
How about a light dinner?

51:22.378 --> 51:24.481
Grilled cheese,
tomato basil soup?

51:24.514 --> 51:26.182
- Sounds perfect.
- Great.

51:26.215 --> 51:27.655
- See you in a little bit.
- See you.

51:38.927 --> 51:40.163
Charlie.

51:41.697 --> 51:43.666
You'll give me a heart attack.

51:43.699 --> 51:46.402
I see you treated
your guest to lunch.

51:46.434 --> 51:48.804
We're celebrating
her healing ankle.

51:48.838 --> 51:51.474
Well, Belinda says
she's really nice.

51:51.507 --> 51:53.742
What for being the enemy
and all.

51:53.775 --> 51:57.646
She's not the enemy.
She's just doing her job.

51:58.514 --> 52:01.151
It's on me to figure out
how to save the house.

52:01.184 --> 52:02.886
You know,

52:02.918 --> 52:06.422
sometimes the biggest problems,
may have the simplest solutions.

52:07.023 --> 52:09.159
Don't forget about
the cookie competition.

52:09.192 --> 52:11.327
Your mother should be proud
even if you just enter.

52:11.927 --> 52:13.795
I'm working on
the recipe tonight.

52:13.829 --> 52:16.932
That's good news. Let me know
if you need a taste tester.

52:16.965 --> 52:19.201
I have one but thank you.

52:19.235 --> 52:20.269
Oh.

52:23.438 --> 52:25.407
- Yeah. Take care.
- See you.

52:42.324 --> 52:43.559
Predictable.

52:43.592 --> 52:44.726
Dependable.

52:44.760 --> 52:45.962
What's your drink?

52:45.994 --> 52:46.994
Bourbon, neat.

52:47.996 --> 52:49.298
Nice tie.

52:49.731 --> 52:52.568
Yes, my girlfriend
has impeccable taste.

52:52.601 --> 52:53.869
How's Philadelphia?

52:56.706 --> 52:58.175
The same.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.544
No signature?

53:02.978 --> 53:04.813
Look, this is not
the typical type of deal

53:04.847 --> 53:06.282
I concern myself with.

53:06.315 --> 53:07.983
You told me
it would be cut and dry.

53:08.016 --> 53:09.719
Cut and dry.

53:09.751 --> 53:11.554
Do you remember Seattle?

53:11.586 --> 53:12.621
Don't.

53:12.655 --> 53:14.724
No. I took the hit on that.

53:18.994 --> 53:23.932
Look, we need to focus
on the business at hand.

53:23.965 --> 53:26.268
Sometimes we need to be patient.

53:29.538 --> 53:31.373
I've lost my patience.

53:40.282 --> 53:41.516
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:41.550 --> 53:42.952
Looks like you did more
shopping?

53:42.985 --> 53:44.787
Oh, I did.

53:44.820 --> 53:50.960
Okay, so I got us smoked Gouda
and then Monterey Jack.

53:50.992 --> 53:53.695
Oh, and I got us this
fresh baked sourdough.

53:53.728 --> 53:54.997
All for tonight.

53:55.030 --> 53:56.030
Outstanding.

53:57.632 --> 53:59.901
What do you want to do,
the Gouda or the Jack?

53:59.934 --> 54:01.536
Um, both.

54:03.072 --> 54:05.775
Perfect. Well two grilled cheese
coming up.

54:05.807 --> 54:09.512
Oh, yeah. I also got us
a really nice bottle of red,

54:09.545 --> 54:11.648
I didn't know,
do you drink wine?

54:11.681 --> 54:13.682
Yeah, I do.
Oh, you went to Baker Bird.

54:13.715 --> 54:15.652
They host the cookie competition
every year.

54:17.385 --> 54:18.920
I don't know,

54:18.954 --> 54:21.024
I've been cooped up
in this house for so many days

54:21.056 --> 54:22.858
I went a little crazy, I guess.

54:23.592 --> 54:26.295
Thank you for going
a little crazy then.

54:26.795 --> 54:28.998
This should take our dinner
to the next level.

54:29.798 --> 54:30.967
I'm gonna go change.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.534
Okay. I'll open up the wine.

54:55.090 --> 54:56.592
Nice shirt.

54:56.625 --> 55:00.063
That soup smells amazing.

55:00.096 --> 55:02.632
It's Belinda's recipe.

55:02.664 --> 55:04.701
She gave it to me
when I went away to college.

55:04.733 --> 55:06.835
She felt I should have access
to my favorite soup

55:06.869 --> 55:08.805
in case I ever need it.

55:08.838 --> 55:10.540
She wasn't wrong.

55:10.572 --> 55:12.808
She does not hold back
her opinion, does she?

55:14.476 --> 55:15.844
No, she definitely does not.

55:17.413 --> 55:19.081
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55:22.418 --> 55:23.686
Mm.

55:23.719 --> 55:26.021
- I'll get these.
- Great, thank you.

55:27.789 --> 55:30.492
I know I keep bugging
you about this competition.

55:30.525 --> 55:34.129
But I really need you to try
my cookie one more time.

55:34.163 --> 55:36.032
And give me your honest opinion.

55:36.065 --> 55:37.099
Again?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.135
All right.

55:39.168 --> 55:40.503
One more time.

55:57.753 --> 55:58.753
Well?

55:59.322 --> 56:02.024
After the fifth time
of trying your cookies today,

56:02.056 --> 56:04.760
these are even better
than last year.

56:04.793 --> 56:06.096
I'm ready!

56:09.632 --> 56:10.900
I still need some milk.

56:14.536 --> 56:16.071
So what did you
study in college?

56:17.472 --> 56:19.875
English literature and writing.

56:20.842 --> 56:24.713
All the baking I did
with my mom growing up

56:24.746 --> 56:27.916
I wanted to write a cookbook
and incorporate stories

56:27.949 --> 56:29.785
with all the recipes.

56:30.418 --> 56:32.388
How about you,
what did you study?

56:33.121 --> 56:34.121
Business.

56:36.525 --> 56:38.595
I was always drawn
to art though.

56:39.829 --> 56:42.131
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

56:42.164 --> 56:45.101
I used to love to go
to the museums

56:45.134 --> 56:47.036
and study Art History.

56:48.036 --> 56:49.805
Business it was.

56:52.208 --> 56:54.677
Well, a business degree
would be ideal

56:54.710 --> 57:00.150
if you wanted to open
your own gallery or art museum.

57:00.849 --> 57:01.985
Yeah.

57:02.784 --> 57:05.721
Business was the only thing
my dad and I had in common.

57:05.753 --> 57:07.190
Gave us something to talk about.

57:09.625 --> 57:14.931
So if you wanted to be a writer,
why did you move away? I mean,

57:14.963 --> 57:16.732
you could have done that
right here.

57:18.032 --> 57:21.002
Well a friend and I
got a job at the same

57:21.036 --> 57:24.106
advertising agency
right out of college.

57:24.139 --> 57:26.910
I wrote copy and he was
a graphic designer.

57:28.043 --> 57:29.811
Thought work would pay
all the bills

57:29.844 --> 57:32.681
while we had time to do
the things we really loved.

57:33.882 --> 57:36.018
You can probably guess
how that went.

57:36.050 --> 57:38.153
Obligations, deadlines.

57:39.954 --> 57:41.056
Meetings...

57:41.690 --> 57:42.690
Didn't happen.

57:44.626 --> 57:46.795
The next thing you know
you need more things.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.565
A nicer place to live.

57:49.597 --> 57:53.001
So you work more
and that's that.

57:54.903 --> 57:56.639
Story of my life.

58:00.242 --> 58:02.144
I guess that's why

58:02.177 --> 58:04.914
my memories of my grandparents
mean so much. You know?

58:10.853 --> 58:14.557
Thank you for the wine
and cheese.

58:14.590 --> 58:18.161
I think it made dinner
a little more special.

58:30.338 --> 58:31.338
Oh.

58:36.711 --> 58:38.914
You ready to make some cookies?

58:38.947 --> 58:41.617
Yeah. I'm going
to return this call.

58:42.050 --> 58:43.286
I'll be right back. Okay?

58:43.518 --> 58:46.054
I'll clean up
and get things ready.

58:57.333 --> 58:58.934
Hey, I got your voicemail.

58:59.635 --> 59:01.771
There's something
that is not right here.

59:01.804 --> 59:04.206
I'm gonna stay around
and I'm gonna figure it out.

59:04.907 --> 59:07.677
Oh, since you didn't
even bother to ask.

59:07.710 --> 59:09.945
Yes. My ankle has healed
very nicely.

59:21.690 --> 59:23.092
Everything okay?

59:23.125 --> 59:25.927
Yeah. Just a work thing.
You know how it goes.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.263
So what do we got going on here?

59:29.864 --> 59:32.601
Oh, these are the ingredients.

59:34.103 --> 59:36.572
Honestly, I'm just trying
to do this by memory, but...

59:38.206 --> 59:40.775
there's still something missing.

59:40.809 --> 59:43.144
Okay, and the papers are for...?

59:43.177 --> 59:44.614
Reference.

59:44.646 --> 59:45.715
Reference.

59:46.949 --> 59:49.784
Yeah, it's just notes,

59:49.818 --> 59:51.787
various ingredients and amounts

59:51.820 --> 59:55.057
that I've tried to replicate
in my mom's recipe but...

59:56.224 --> 59:58.126
I just can't get it quite right.

1:00:00.195 --> 1:00:04.200
Okay. Well, what's off? Is it
the taste or is it the texture?

1:00:05.867 --> 1:00:07.336
Texture.

1:00:10.072 --> 1:00:13.076
Well we can assume
we're missing an ingredient.

1:00:13.809 --> 1:00:15.077
Wow.

1:00:15.110 --> 1:00:17.246
You're really good at this.

1:00:18.179 --> 1:00:21.149
I am in analytics.

1:00:22.451 --> 1:00:24.219
Taste testing's just for fun.

1:00:26.054 --> 1:00:30.992
Well, I feel we're moving
in the right direction at least.

1:00:31.025 --> 1:00:32.094
I think you're right.

1:00:38.099 --> 1:00:40.368
This deal was to be
signed a week ago.

1:00:40.402 --> 1:00:42.137
We should be
breaking ground now.

1:00:42.170 --> 1:00:44.873
I said going into this,
if we were going to do it,

1:00:44.907 --> 1:00:46.342
we were going to do it fast.

1:00:46.375 --> 1:00:50.112
The property is basically ours.
If all we do...

1:00:50.144 --> 1:00:54.250
It is not our property
until those papers are signed.

1:00:58.086 --> 1:01:01.023
How utterly disappointing.

1:01:01.056 --> 1:01:05.260
I changed my important schedule
to handle this mess.

1:01:05.293 --> 1:01:07.797
A mess my maid
could have handled.

1:01:08.764 --> 1:01:10.266
The deal is not lost.

1:01:10.298 --> 1:01:13.001
Now, we all stand to gain
something very significant

1:01:13.034 --> 1:01:15.370
once we get those
documents signed.

1:01:16.038 --> 1:01:18.740
I pulled in a big favor
to get those papers audited

1:01:18.773 --> 1:01:21.042
and I'm not going to walk away
with nothing.

1:01:21.076 --> 1:01:22.945
How do you
intend to fix it, Ronan?

1:01:30.284 --> 1:01:33.254
I found the property.

1:01:33.288 --> 1:01:36.391
I got the developer's contact.

1:01:36.425 --> 1:01:41.097
It's because of me that
you stand to gain something

1:01:41.130 --> 1:01:44.432
very, very significant.

1:01:44.465 --> 1:01:47.368
Pistols, at 20 paces?

1:01:48.737 --> 1:01:51.139
I hold you both accountable.

1:01:51.940 --> 1:01:53.309
Now fix it!

1:01:55.143 --> 1:01:56.511
Clearly, you miscalculated.

1:01:56.545 --> 1:01:58.914
Theodora's ability
to close this deal.

1:02:00.481 --> 1:02:02.250
Ah, yes.

1:02:02.284 --> 1:02:03.885
Where is Theodora?

1:02:11.126 --> 1:02:12.126
Fired.

1:02:26.474 --> 1:02:27.844
Is that you?

1:02:28.376 --> 1:02:30.278
- Yeah.
- Aww.

1:02:30.311 --> 1:02:32.480
My mother's
favorite picture of me.

1:02:32.514 --> 1:02:34.817
Look at you. You were so cute.

1:02:36.518 --> 1:02:37.518
What's that?

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.162
Oh, wow.

1:02:47.496 --> 1:02:49.798
This is it. This is the recipe.

1:02:49.831 --> 1:02:50.831
No way.

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:53.568
Two tablespoons of
white vinegar. That's it.

1:02:53.601 --> 1:02:55.103
That's the missing ingredient.

1:02:55.871 --> 1:02:59.508
That's one tablespoon, I think.
One tablespoon of white vinegar.

1:02:59.541 --> 1:03:02.912
You're right. You're right on.
That could have been bad.

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:04.080
That's a little error.

1:03:05.547 --> 1:03:08.184
I even... I remember my mother,
she would say

1:03:08.217 --> 1:03:11.119
this is the ingredient that adds
the magic to the cookie.

1:03:11.152 --> 1:03:13.855
She put in right what I thought
was a tablespoon of just water

1:03:13.889 --> 1:03:15.358
but it was vinegar.

1:03:16.291 --> 1:03:17.860
Well, let's get busy, right?

1:03:20.027 --> 1:03:23.998
- Oh, no, no, no. Oh.
- What? What is it?

1:03:24.032 --> 1:03:26.168
I forgot to sign up
for the competition.

1:03:26.201 --> 1:03:27.969
The deadline's
tonight at midnight.

1:03:28.003 --> 1:03:31.407
Okay, it's nine o'clock.
So where do you have to go?

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:34.043
The diner.
Belinda might still be there.

1:03:36.911 --> 1:03:40.882
I think I'm gonna try making
a bourbon chocolate pecan.

1:03:40.916 --> 1:03:42.918
Well, you tell me when
and I will be here

1:03:42.951 --> 1:03:44.552
for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.

1:03:44.585 --> 1:03:47.388
You are already here for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

1:03:47.422 --> 1:03:49.190
Yeah.

1:03:49.224 --> 1:03:51.169
Hey, what about our boy Charlie
and that city girl?

1:03:51.193 --> 1:03:54.163
- They make a nice couple.
- They do. Theodora and Charlie.

1:03:54.195 --> 1:03:55.563
When two people meant...

1:03:55.597 --> 1:03:57.932
- It's Theodora and Charlie!
- Come on in.

1:03:57.965 --> 1:04:00.068
- Come in, guys.
- Come in.

1:04:00.101 --> 1:04:02.437
Hey. Are you here
for a late night slice?

1:04:02.471 --> 1:04:05.474
Thank you.
But we found mom's recipe.

1:04:05.507 --> 1:04:08.577
Wonderful. You're sure
to win the competition.

1:04:08.610 --> 1:04:10.312
He can't win
if he doesn't enter.

1:04:10.344 --> 1:04:12.013
- What!
- I know you have the forms,

1:04:12.047 --> 1:04:13.457
I should have enough time
to get it filled out

1:04:13.481 --> 1:04:14.601
and to the community center.

1:04:15.217 --> 1:04:16.217
There.

1:04:16.485 --> 1:04:18.120
Get it done.
Get it over there quick.

1:04:18.152 --> 1:04:20.154
The mayor will surely
be there at midnight

1:04:20.188 --> 1:04:21.557
to pick up those forms.

1:04:22.990 --> 1:04:24.659
Would you like some pie?

1:04:24.693 --> 1:04:28.030
Oh, no. We are going
to fill this out.

1:04:28.063 --> 1:04:29.632
Get it to the office,
then we have

1:04:29.664 --> 1:04:32.433
got to get back to his house
so we can start baking.

1:04:32.467 --> 1:04:35.003
I mean, we have two days
until the competition.

1:04:35.036 --> 1:04:38.673
So maybe tomorrow I might come
in and get a couple of slices.

1:04:38.706 --> 1:04:41.442
Tomorrow, she may have
chocolate bourbon pecan pie.

1:04:41.476 --> 1:04:44.113
Hey, keep writing.

1:04:46.547 --> 1:04:47.949
- That's it. I got it.
- Okay.

1:04:47.983 --> 1:04:49.218
- All right.
- Thank you.

1:04:49.251 --> 1:04:51.120
- Go. Go.
- Save me a couple of slices.

1:04:51.152 --> 1:04:53.221
I'll save them,
I'll save them. Go!

1:04:53.255 --> 1:04:55.557
Just get out of here.
They making me a wreck.

1:04:55.590 --> 1:04:57.093
It's nice to see.

1:04:58.193 --> 1:05:00.229
- Young and in love.
- Well.

1:05:00.661 --> 1:05:02.931
I think love is good at any age.

1:05:02.965 --> 1:05:03.966
Yes, it is.

1:05:08.170 --> 1:05:11.072
Okay, so yesterday's cookies
were really, really good, but...

1:05:12.239 --> 1:05:13.239
these are magic.

1:05:14.009 --> 1:05:15.177
You can taste the love.

1:05:20.349 --> 1:05:21.349
Thank you.

1:05:23.585 --> 1:05:24.585
For what?

1:05:27.556 --> 1:05:30.425
If you hadn't picked up
the photo,

1:05:30.458 --> 1:05:32.193
I wouldn't have found
the recipe.

1:05:36.264 --> 1:05:37.400
Thank you.

1:05:39.266 --> 1:05:40.535
Just for letting me help.

1:05:42.637 --> 1:05:44.640
I didn't realize
how much I missed

1:05:44.672 --> 1:05:46.341
just doing
these kinds of things.

1:05:48.476 --> 1:05:49.511
Me too.

1:05:54.115 --> 1:05:56.719
Well.

1:05:56.751 --> 1:06:00.288
I can whip up some frosting
if you want to help me decorate?

1:06:01.188 --> 1:06:02.623
Wait a second.

1:06:02.657 --> 1:06:04.526
It's gonna be like
one of those corny movies

1:06:04.559 --> 1:06:06.528
where he puts the frosting
on her nose

1:06:06.561 --> 1:06:09.164
and she puts the frosting
on his nose

1:06:09.197 --> 1:06:10.333
and then they end up...

1:06:33.621 --> 1:06:34.621
Um.

1:06:37.425 --> 1:06:38.460
You...

1:06:40.195 --> 1:06:43.065
You only have a day to get
ready for the competition.

1:06:45.634 --> 1:06:47.635
And I have a meeting
in the morning.

1:06:48.235 --> 1:06:50.105
- I think we should...
- Right.

1:06:53.442 --> 1:06:54.443
Goodnight, Charles.

1:06:55.210 --> 1:06:56.210
Goodnight.

1:07:17.532 --> 1:07:18.534
Charles?

1:07:25.873 --> 1:07:27.842
<i>Theodora?</i>

1:07:27.876 --> 1:07:30.245
<i>Theodora, come on.</i>

1:07:30.277 --> 1:07:32.313
<i>Get all the little things
and bring them out</i>

1:07:32.347 --> 1:07:33.716
<i>and decorate the tree.</i>

1:07:50.231 --> 1:07:51.233
Hey.

1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:53.202
Good morning.

1:07:53.235 --> 1:07:54.235
Hey.

1:07:55.836 --> 1:07:57.539
Didn't you buy new shoes?

1:07:57.572 --> 1:07:59.708
I didn't want to get them dirty.

1:08:01.275 --> 1:08:02.844
But you're okay
getting mine dirty?

1:08:02.878 --> 1:08:04.646
Come on. These are filthy.

1:08:06.815 --> 1:08:08.583
You can take the girl
out of the city

1:08:08.617 --> 1:08:10.352
but not the city
out of the girl, uh?

1:08:10.885 --> 1:08:13.856
I don't know about that. It's...

1:08:15.923 --> 1:08:18.194
It is so beautiful here. It's...

1:08:19.293 --> 1:08:20.762
It's so peaceful.

1:08:22.930 --> 1:08:25.533
Yeah, yeah, it really is.

1:08:28.737 --> 1:08:30.838
I could see myself writing here.

1:08:30.872 --> 1:08:32.108
You know?

1:08:35.342 --> 1:08:37.512
I have some more chores
that need to get done.

1:08:37.546 --> 1:08:40.382
Sure. You need
some help with them?

1:08:40.414 --> 1:08:42.618
No. No. Thank you. I got it.

1:08:42.650 --> 1:08:43.853
Okay.

1:08:44.153 --> 1:08:46.755
Well, I'm freezing and I
haven't had my coffee. So.

1:08:46.787 --> 1:08:48.256
I'm gonna go in.

1:08:48.289 --> 1:08:49.725
Full sentences
and you even offered

1:08:49.757 --> 1:08:52.161
to help me with chores
all before coffee.

1:08:52.194 --> 1:08:54.830
Well, I guess I am
just full of surprises.

1:09:00.734 --> 1:09:02.237
Yes you are, Miss Greenly.

1:09:28.997 --> 1:09:31.634
One tablespoon of vinegar,
not two.

1:09:42.577 --> 1:09:44.713
It's one tablespoon of vinegar.
Not two.

1:09:59.394 --> 1:10:01.663
Hey, I am sorry
I missed your calls.

1:10:01.695 --> 1:10:03.798
I had the phone on silent
and fell asleep.

1:10:04.166 --> 1:10:07.670
But, um,
regarding the King account,

1:10:09.371 --> 1:10:11.739
I think there's
been an oversight.

1:10:13.041 --> 1:10:14.743
I'm going to
give you a call later.

1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:27.623
It's just an error
in the numbers.

1:10:42.436 --> 1:10:45.541
Why? Why can you
still not access the files?

1:10:46.341 --> 1:10:47.910
I'm trying.

1:10:48.409 --> 1:10:51.680
It seems as if there's
some sort of a hold on them.

1:10:52.814 --> 1:10:54.983
Lila was a dear friend of mine.

1:10:55.015 --> 1:10:56.951
Now I know business is business,

1:10:56.984 --> 1:11:01.589
but if I can help save her farm,
I will do everything I can.

1:11:01.622 --> 1:11:04.058
Okay. Okay, then
if I could just see them.

1:11:04.091 --> 1:11:07.362
If I could just see your files
then I might be able to find

1:11:07.395 --> 1:11:08.805
a discrepancy to stop
the foreclosure

1:11:08.829 --> 1:11:11.800
but I need your files
to compare them to mine.

1:11:11.832 --> 1:11:14.068
Well, I don't want
to keep you waiting.

1:11:14.101 --> 1:11:17.706
I'll email you the file
once our system is compliant.

1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:21.609
This is an urgent matter.
Do you understand?

1:11:26.814 --> 1:11:28.649
When are you leaving town?

1:11:28.682 --> 1:11:31.586
It's just one more day until
the cookie competition.

1:11:31.618 --> 1:11:32.654
Oh, I know.

1:11:35.422 --> 1:11:36.457
Didn't you hear?

1:11:40.494 --> 1:11:42.497
Charles found Lila's recipe.

1:11:44.865 --> 1:11:46.435
He's in the competition.

1:12:28.042 --> 1:12:29.042
Hey.

1:12:29.810 --> 1:12:31.545
I just came from the bank.

1:12:31.578 --> 1:12:33.748
Do you want to tell me
why the King file is locked?

1:12:34.815 --> 1:12:35.951
We got...

1:12:38.485 --> 1:12:39.654
I know. Ye...

1:12:40.721 --> 1:12:41.923
No, you see I think...

1:12:48.195 --> 1:12:49.195
Okay.

1:12:49.864 --> 1:12:53.068
Yes, yes. I will be on
the next plane. I will.

1:12:53.902 --> 1:12:54.903
But, dad...

1:12:56.871 --> 1:12:58.472
Dad, can you please tell me

1:12:58.506 --> 1:13:00.509
what's going on
with the King property...

1:13:02.010 --> 1:13:03.010
Dad?

1:13:10.918 --> 1:13:11.918
Dad?

1:13:14.555 --> 1:13:18.760
Is the man who is trying
to take my home your dad?

1:13:21.061 --> 1:13:24.932
Okay. Yes, but it is not
what it looks like.

1:13:24.966 --> 1:13:26.668
- It's not?
- No.

1:13:26.701 --> 1:13:29.137
So, what is it supposed
to look like?

1:13:29.938 --> 1:13:32.507
It's... I mean,
am I supposed to think that

1:13:32.539 --> 1:13:35.176
you actually understand how
important it is for me to keep

1:13:35.210 --> 1:13:36.778
- this house?
- I do.

1:13:36.810 --> 1:13:39.880
Or that maybe you
care about something,

1:13:39.913 --> 1:13:41.617
anything other than money?

1:13:42.783 --> 1:13:44.685
- Charles, wait. It's not...
- No. Listen.

1:13:44.719 --> 1:13:47.689
I'm not stupid. But I actually
thought you were different.

1:13:49.490 --> 1:13:52.594
You've spent so much time
trying to impress your father,

1:13:52.627 --> 1:13:54.530
but you're just like him.
Aren't you?

1:13:57.698 --> 1:13:59.567
You really
are full of surprises.

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:02.570
Charles. No, please.
Just listen...

1:14:04.104 --> 1:14:05.106
You...

1:14:06.774 --> 1:14:11.046
You, the type of person
that would interrupt someone

1:14:11.078 --> 1:14:13.648
when they're mourning
the loss of someone they love.

1:14:15.283 --> 1:14:17.118
You're constantly looking
at your watch,

1:14:17.150 --> 1:14:18.953
like you're somehow
more important

1:14:18.987 --> 1:14:20.556
than everyone else on Earth.

1:14:24.158 --> 1:14:25.961
You don't really care
about anyone else

1:14:25.993 --> 1:14:27.895
other than yourself. Do you?

1:14:27.929 --> 1:14:28.963
It's not true.

1:14:30.998 --> 1:14:32.033
It isn't true.

1:14:34.702 --> 1:14:35.971
I think your ankle looks fine.

1:14:38.038 --> 1:14:39.640
It's time for you to leave.

1:14:42.277 --> 1:14:43.277
Charles.

1:14:44.279 --> 1:14:45.948
Charles, please wait.

1:14:58.225 --> 1:15:00.261
I don't care what you think,

1:15:00.295 --> 1:15:03.765
that girl is not out
to get you or the farm.

1:15:03.797 --> 1:15:07.135
Charlie. If you saw the
way she looked at you last night

1:15:07.167 --> 1:15:08.636
you'd feel different right now.

1:15:08.670 --> 1:15:10.572
I heard her on the phone, Nick.

1:15:10.604 --> 1:15:12.706
Her dad sent her
to take my farm.

1:15:12.739 --> 1:15:14.309
You don't let people explain.

1:15:14.341 --> 1:15:16.644
Then what, you lose out
on the best things in life?

1:15:16.677 --> 1:15:19.914
Charlie, don't let
this happen again.

1:15:20.881 --> 1:15:22.518
Look at how much time we lost.

1:15:26.621 --> 1:15:29.190
Theodora was just here,
she bought two pieces of pie

1:15:29.222 --> 1:15:32.159
to bring home and she said
she has some really good news...

1:15:32.193 --> 1:15:35.564
To bring home, you mean to bring
to my house. That's my home.

1:15:35.596 --> 1:15:38.632
Charles King,
I'll tell you what I think.

1:15:38.666 --> 1:15:40.902
I think you've missed this town
for a long time now.

1:15:40.935 --> 1:15:43.271
Coming back here
made you realize all of that.

1:15:43.304 --> 1:15:45.873
The thought of losing it,
is more than you can take.

1:15:45.907 --> 1:15:47.708
It's easier for you
to close yourself off

1:15:47.742 --> 1:15:48.877
to the possibilities.

1:15:48.909 --> 1:15:49.909
Am I right?

1:15:51.145 --> 1:15:53.248
You ran away,
didn't let me explain.

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:55.817
Now you're running away
from somebody who loves you.

1:15:56.484 --> 1:15:58.653
Don't make
the same mistake twice.

1:15:58.685 --> 1:16:00.921
And after all
the girls you've dated,

1:16:00.954 --> 1:16:03.224
and now you found someone who is

1:16:03.256 --> 1:16:05.326
as perfect for you
as those cookies

1:16:05.359 --> 1:16:07.828
is another thing
that you don't want to lose.

1:16:07.862 --> 1:16:08.963
I was upset.

1:16:09.896 --> 1:16:11.132
I just left.

1:16:11.432 --> 1:16:13.734
You have someone you don't trust
alone in your home.

1:16:13.768 --> 1:16:15.770
That seems
pretty trusting to me.

1:16:19.172 --> 1:16:24.313
Look, I... I said
some really harsh things.

1:16:26.279 --> 1:16:29.083
When you love someone,
you're willing to forgive them.

1:16:30.283 --> 1:16:33.154
Or, you hope for a little magic.

1:16:38.393 --> 1:16:39.962
Such a way with words.

1:16:40.729 --> 1:16:42.764
I'm going to get you
some breakfast.

1:16:42.796 --> 1:16:44.665
It's time to bake
some champ cookies.

1:16:44.698 --> 1:16:46.300
I'll be there
right by your side.

1:16:46.333 --> 1:16:47.333
Eating them.

1:16:54.274 --> 1:16:56.411
Okay, you see that?
That right there?

1:16:56.444 --> 1:16:58.246
That is exactly what I needed.

1:16:58.279 --> 1:17:01.182
Remind me to send Kelly
a thank you letter.

1:17:01.215 --> 1:17:03.284
And probably
a letter of recommendation

1:17:03.317 --> 1:17:07.122
because, once Ronan finds out
he sent us these files,

1:17:07.154 --> 1:17:08.789
he's gonna be looking
for a new job.

1:17:08.823 --> 1:17:10.725
I think he was more
than happy to help.

1:17:10.757 --> 1:17:12.926
Your dad really did
a number on the Kings.

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:14.229
Yeah, he doesn't care.

1:17:15.029 --> 1:17:17.733
He just cares how much money
the land will bring in.

1:17:18.432 --> 1:17:19.701
You know what?

1:17:22.203 --> 1:17:26.307
It really is,
it is such a beautiful farm.

1:17:28.275 --> 1:17:29.911
I won't let him destroy it.

1:17:30.778 --> 1:17:31.980
What about Charles?

1:17:32.814 --> 1:17:33.914
It's his home.

1:17:36.283 --> 1:17:39.153
He grew up in that town so
he really wants to settle there.

1:17:41.055 --> 1:17:42.856
Did I tell you he's a writer?

1:17:42.890 --> 1:17:44.126
No, you didn't.

1:17:44.893 --> 1:17:47.028
And what's with the sparkle
in your eyes

1:17:47.060 --> 1:17:48.764
- when you talk about him?
- What?

1:17:50.797 --> 1:17:52.800
You are in love!

1:17:53.734 --> 1:17:58.072
Yes, indeed. You are in love
with the cookie man.

1:18:05.279 --> 1:18:06.279
I am.

1:18:09.951 --> 1:18:11.252
I really think I am.

1:18:11.284 --> 1:18:12.987
That is so amazing!

1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:15.056
Who would've thought
you were going to foreclose

1:18:15.088 --> 1:18:18.158
on a property and instead
you'd fell in love? It's like...

1:18:18.192 --> 1:18:21.063
Oh, no! Do not say magic.

1:18:22.863 --> 1:18:25.365
We need to focus because
if this plan is not perfect,

1:18:25.399 --> 1:18:27.802
then he'll lose the farm
and I won't see him anymore.

1:18:27.835 --> 1:18:29.136
So come help me.

1:18:29.170 --> 1:18:32.172
- What next?
- Right here.

1:18:32.206 --> 1:18:33.975
Did you decorate these?

1:18:35.009 --> 1:18:36.478
No. It was Theodora.

1:18:37.944 --> 1:18:39.346
Wow. Impressive.

1:18:40.782 --> 1:18:43.184
She's an artist.

1:18:43.216 --> 1:18:45.319
It's actually
what she's passionate about.

1:18:49.457 --> 1:18:51.159
Wish she was still here.

1:18:53.293 --> 1:18:54.293
Man, I...

1:18:55.896 --> 1:18:57.099
I really screwed up.

1:18:58.332 --> 1:19:00.335
You can't think like that.

1:19:00.368 --> 1:19:02.771
You just got to win
this competition.

1:19:02.804 --> 1:19:03.971
And then go after her.

1:19:05.038 --> 1:19:06.742
Talk to her. She'll understand.

1:19:07.609 --> 1:19:10.812
That's three in a row. I assume
these are competition ready?

1:19:11.078 --> 1:19:13.181
- Mmm.
- We have to make more.

1:19:14.548 --> 1:19:15.949
Hey!

1:19:15.983 --> 1:19:17.319
C'mon, man.

1:19:27.127 --> 1:19:28.395
Melissa, leave us.

1:19:28.429 --> 1:19:29.998
No, no, no.

1:19:30.631 --> 1:19:32.834
She is my assistant
and she is my friend.

1:19:35.336 --> 1:19:37.204
- Your friend?
- Mm-hmm.

1:19:38.005 --> 1:19:41.376
I've been working with this
group from Buffalo for months

1:19:41.408 --> 1:19:45.179
and I will not stand by
and watch you destroy this deal.

1:19:46.847 --> 1:19:49.150
- Are you uncomfortable?
- Unbelievably.

1:19:50.417 --> 1:19:52.252
Go talk to Kelly
and prepare the papers.

1:19:52.286 --> 1:19:55.056
I'd do it pretty quick
because I fired Kelly

1:19:55.088 --> 1:19:57.958
and he's probably
on his escorted walk out.

1:20:03.597 --> 1:20:06.067
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1:20:08.336 --> 1:20:11.472
You're not even
in the same ballpark

1:20:11.505 --> 1:20:13.809
as the group from Buffalo.

1:20:14.975 --> 1:20:16.577
And by the way,

1:20:16.610 --> 1:20:20.081
the only thing I'll be signing
for you young lady,

1:20:20.113 --> 1:20:22.550
is your termination papers.

1:20:22.951 --> 1:20:26.154
You know, this soft
attitude of yours, you,

1:20:26.186 --> 1:20:28.489
this, this will destroy you.

1:20:29.222 --> 1:20:31.091
It always does.

1:20:35.595 --> 1:20:37.264
I am so disappointed.

1:20:39.033 --> 1:20:40.202
So disappointed.

1:20:42.336 --> 1:20:43.872
After your grandparents...

1:20:43.904 --> 1:20:45.472
No, no, no. No.

1:20:45.506 --> 1:20:48.142
You don't get to talk about
them, you cold-hearted...

1:20:48.175 --> 1:20:49.077
Careful!

1:20:49.109 --> 1:20:50.845
Be very careful!

1:20:57.118 --> 1:21:00.455
You willfully deceived
a dying woman.

1:21:04.457 --> 1:21:06.260
What kind of evil person
does that?

1:21:07.127 --> 1:21:09.496
One old farm.

1:21:09.529 --> 1:21:11.632
What does that matter?

1:21:13.167 --> 1:21:14.569
What is this?

1:21:14.601 --> 1:21:16.537
Theodora, the papers are ready.

1:21:18.038 --> 1:21:19.474
Where did this come from?

1:21:19.506 --> 1:21:22.109
A messenger brought it
just before you arrived.

1:21:22.143 --> 1:21:24.412
A nice older gentleman.

1:21:24.444 --> 1:21:26.081
Reminded me of Santa.

1:21:36.657 --> 1:21:37.926
Santa.

1:21:41.962 --> 1:21:43.465
Santa Claus.

1:21:46.167 --> 1:21:49.938
There is no such person.

1:21:52.105 --> 1:21:53.641
That's where you're wrong.

1:21:55.141 --> 1:21:56.478
It's Christmas.

1:21:57.578 --> 1:22:00.048
It's time of hope,
and love, and...

1:22:03.551 --> 1:22:04.686
and magic.

1:22:06.619 --> 1:22:08.655
It's time to be
with people who love you,

1:22:08.689 --> 1:22:09.689
who care about you.

1:22:11.158 --> 1:22:13.695
And yeah, it's a time
to believe in Santa.

1:22:16.564 --> 1:22:17.966
Magic.

1:22:20.634 --> 1:22:22.237
Santa.

1:22:23.703 --> 1:22:25.305
Santa.

1:22:25.338 --> 1:22:27.242
Are you two insane?

1:22:28.309 --> 1:22:29.476
You've taught me a lot.

1:22:30.578 --> 1:22:31.613
You have.

1:22:33.546 --> 1:22:38.218
You've taught me exactly
who I don't want to be.

1:22:38.685 --> 1:22:41.154
You've taught me
that nothing but work

1:22:41.188 --> 1:22:43.591
just makes you bitter, cold.

1:22:45.158 --> 1:22:46.961
You're so deceitful, angry.

1:22:49.396 --> 1:22:51.332
I don't want to be like you.

1:22:51.364 --> 1:22:53.268
I'm nothing like you.

1:22:59.172 --> 1:23:00.307
I'm not you.

1:23:00.675 --> 1:23:02.110
Thank goodness.

1:23:03.176 --> 1:23:04.445
Now I love you.

1:23:05.145 --> 1:23:07.215
I do love you.

1:23:08.515 --> 1:23:11.051
But I really don't like you.

1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:15.657
And I'm going to tell you
what you're going to do.

1:23:16.689 --> 1:23:18.425
You're going to fix this.

1:23:18.458 --> 1:23:21.796
You're going to report
that deed paid in full. You are.

1:23:21.828 --> 1:23:25.065
And you are going to do this
because if you don't

1:23:25.099 --> 1:23:28.269
I am sending every single shred
of evidence I have to Charles

1:23:28.301 --> 1:23:29.703
and then I...

1:23:29.737 --> 1:23:32.206
I will help him bury you
with it.

1:23:32.238 --> 1:23:35.175
Do we have an agreement, dad?

1:23:36.743 --> 1:23:40.347
No, no, no, no. That that little
intimidation stare thing,

1:23:40.381 --> 1:23:41.615
that doesn't work on me.

1:23:42.449 --> 1:23:45.420
Do we have a deal?

1:23:47.688 --> 1:23:49.724
Send the papers to my office.

1:23:50.056 --> 1:23:52.027
I'll sign them directly.

1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:53.795
Melissa will escort you out.

1:23:53.828 --> 1:23:55.096
I will?

1:23:55.496 --> 1:23:56.498
I will.

1:24:00.533 --> 1:24:02.069
Oh, dad. One last thing.

1:24:03.671 --> 1:24:04.671
I quit.

1:24:17.851 --> 1:24:19.054
<i>Theodora.</i>

1:24:19.886 --> 1:24:22.155
<i>Theodora, come on.</i>

1:24:22.189 --> 1:24:24.158
<i>Get all the little things
and bring them out</i>

1:24:24.190 --> 1:24:26.161
<i>and decorate the tree.</i>

1:25:13.239 --> 1:25:15.309
I have a good feeling
about this.

1:25:17.545 --> 1:25:19.547
You know,
I never did say thank you.

1:25:19.579 --> 1:25:20.614
No need.

1:25:22.349 --> 1:25:26.621
<i>♪ Wonders of his heart ♪</i>

1:25:26.654 --> 1:25:33.428
<i>♪ Wonders of his heart ♪</i>

1:25:40.266 --> 1:25:42.170
Merry Christmas everyone.

1:25:42.203 --> 1:25:44.572
Merry Christmas!

1:25:44.604 --> 1:25:46.373
Wonderful.
I hope you are all having

1:25:46.407 --> 1:25:48.176
a fabulous time this evening.

1:25:48.208 --> 1:25:51.311
And this year let's not dismiss
the mistletoe. Okay?

1:25:51.345 --> 1:25:52.680
All right.

1:25:52.712 --> 1:25:54.715
So also while you're
out and about

1:25:54.747 --> 1:25:57.918
enjoying the evening, make sure
you stop by the raffle table,

1:25:57.952 --> 1:26:00.288
get your tickets
for the drawings this evening.

1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:01.389
I got mine!

1:26:01.421 --> 1:26:03.290
If you don't get tickets,

1:26:03.323 --> 1:26:06.493
Nancy's winning
everything this year. So.

1:26:06.527 --> 1:26:10.765
Now, understand this year
has been the toughest year

1:26:10.797 --> 1:26:12.699
for judging
the cookie competition.

1:26:12.733 --> 1:26:13.935
So let's find out.

1:26:13.967 --> 1:26:16.671
Judge. Have you chosen a winner?

1:26:17.570 --> 1:26:18.672
Yes.

1:26:19.974 --> 1:26:20.974
I have.

1:26:21.708 --> 1:26:24.746
Let me invite up
our two finalists for this year.

1:26:26.279 --> 1:26:28.682
Helena Corrival
and Charlie King!

1:26:29.050 --> 1:26:32.686
Charlie. Charlie. Charlie.

1:26:41.295 --> 1:26:45.533
And now this year's New Richmond

1:26:45.565 --> 1:26:48.403
Christmas cookie champion...

1:26:49.770 --> 1:26:51.573
Charlie King!

1:26:59.747 --> 1:27:01.583
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1:27:02.149 --> 1:27:06.420
Our cookie champion,
Charlie King, say a few words.

1:27:09.590 --> 1:27:10.625
Wow. Um...

1:27:12.659 --> 1:27:14.295
I'm really not prepared.

1:27:18.498 --> 1:27:21.902
The honor of being
your cookie champion

1:27:21.935 --> 1:27:24.038
means a very great deal to me.

1:27:24.070 --> 1:27:28.742
This whole thing, it's really
just a tribute and a thanks

1:27:28.775 --> 1:27:30.278
to my mother.

1:27:32.712 --> 1:27:33.780
Her recipe.

1:27:41.087 --> 1:27:43.457
I missed this town
while I was away.

1:27:45.792 --> 1:27:46.792
The people.

1:27:49.662 --> 1:27:52.599
No matter how hard I tried
with college,

1:27:52.632 --> 1:27:54.868
my big job in Boston, I always,

1:27:54.902 --> 1:27:57.605
I always felt like something
was missing in my life.

1:27:59.439 --> 1:28:01.275
An important ingredient.

1:28:03.711 --> 1:28:06.280
Coming back here helped me
realize what that was.

1:28:07.914 --> 1:28:08.914
My mother knew it.

1:28:10.818 --> 1:28:11.818
Now I do too.

1:28:15.521 --> 1:28:16.524
It's love.

1:28:18.859 --> 1:28:21.062
I couldn't have
figured this out without you.

1:28:24.530 --> 1:28:28.603
Without you even knowing it,
you showed up and...

1:28:30.604 --> 1:28:32.006
showed me what I was missing.

1:28:36.777 --> 1:28:37.777
I'm sorry.

1:28:38.479 --> 1:28:40.414
I should have given you
a chance to explain.

1:28:40.447 --> 1:28:42.449
- It's okay.
- You coming back like this.

1:28:42.483 --> 1:28:43.984
It's... It's like Christmas...

1:28:44.016 --> 1:28:46.354
No, no, don't say magic.

1:28:48.654 --> 1:28:49.690
We'll call it love.

1:29:25.926 --> 1:29:27.362
I don't understand.

1:29:27.694 --> 1:29:28.795
The farm is yours.

1:29:29.529 --> 1:29:31.465
There's nothing left
to understand.

1:29:33.100 --> 1:29:34.535
How did you do this?

1:29:35.101 --> 1:29:37.704
Do you forget, I am
one hell of a businesswoman.

1:29:41.041 --> 1:29:43.610
I guess I was right. You can't
take the city out of the girl.

1:29:43.644 --> 1:29:44.645
Mm-mm. No.

1:29:45.444 --> 1:29:48.782
But you can probably bribe her
with some Christmas cookies.

1:29:48.815 --> 1:29:51.385
I'll open a whole bakery
if that's what it takes.

1:29:53.654 --> 1:29:55.390
That's actually
a brilliant idea.

1:29:55.756 --> 1:29:57.857
Okay, so I have a friend
who is an investor

1:29:57.890 --> 1:30:00.460
- and he can find us...
- Whoa. Whoa.

1:30:00.493 --> 1:30:02.162
Let's conquer Christmas first.

1:30:02.195 --> 1:30:04.532
Don't you two
worry about Christmas.

1:30:04.564 --> 1:30:05.732
I'll take care of that.

1:30:10.871 --> 1:30:11.905
Who's that?

1:30:15.042 --> 1:30:17.912
It's my... What's he doing here?

1:30:22.149 --> 1:30:25.986
I guess I'm the last person
you wanted to see.

1:30:26.019 --> 1:30:27.019
Mm-hmm.

1:30:30.157 --> 1:30:34.595
When you walked out, I...
I had this incredible emptiness

1:30:34.627 --> 1:30:35.762
in my heart.

1:30:36.430 --> 1:30:39.567
The same emptiness that I felt
when I lost your mother.

1:30:43.069 --> 1:30:44.905
Hey. Um.

1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:50.011
My mother and I had
our differences when I left.

1:30:52.546 --> 1:30:55.615
He came all this way,
you should hear him out.

1:30:58.085 --> 1:30:59.720
Charles is right.

1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:01.020
You know, I...

1:31:02.622 --> 1:31:05.960
I should have known this
for years, that you...

1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:10.997
you are the best thing
in my life.

1:31:12.265 --> 1:31:15.168
Not my company, not my money,
it's you.

1:31:15.202 --> 1:31:18.606
You were always the best thing
in my life and I am so sorry.

1:31:20.140 --> 1:31:23.610
So sorry that I ever made you
feel that you weren't.

1:31:24.243 --> 1:31:27.214
I just want to make it up to you
if you'll let me.

1:31:28.215 --> 1:31:29.215
How?

1:31:30.050 --> 1:31:32.953
I've missed
most of our lives together.

1:31:32.985 --> 1:31:35.155
I don't want to miss anymore.

1:31:41.962 --> 1:31:45.566
Can you forgive a cranky,
hard headed old man?

1:32:09.823 --> 1:32:10.823
Hi, Melissa.

1:32:13.726 --> 1:32:15.595
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1:32:23.837 --> 1:32:24.837
Hi, Helena.

1:32:31.744 --> 1:32:34.247
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1:32:37.149 --> 1:32:38.149
I love you.

1:32:40.753 --> 1:32:41.756
Merry Christmas.

1:32:44.056 --> 1:32:45.693
Merry Christmas, Charlie.
