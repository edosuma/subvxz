WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.628
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.711 --> 00:04.796
So you get me that money,

00:04.880 --> 00:08.466
or life in here will take a turn
for the disastrous.

00:08.717 --> 00:14.764
How am I gonna get my hands on that money,
you think, while I am inside here?

00:15.516 --> 00:19.185
Nap time's over, Gimpy. Come on.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.188
<i>What the hell, Dickie?</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.109
<i>Well, you know, the thing is,
I really had no choice, Raylan.</i>

00:26.193 --> 00:30.530
They forced me into it. You see,
the escape, the money, the whole thing.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.866
To be very clear, Raylan, I am the victim here.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.077
Yeah, that much is clear.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.620
What's this about, Boyd?

00:37.955 --> 00:41.374
Well, how would you like a change
in occupation?

00:42.501 --> 00:43.626
What do you got in mind?

00:44.169 --> 00:48.464
There's an election coming soon,
Office of County Sheriff.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.300
- Tillman Napier's job?
- He wasn't elected for life.

00:52.177 --> 00:56.389
Now, he serves at the pleasure
of the good people of Harlan County.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.684
And I think you might be just the man
for the job.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.961
When I was young, I could sleep like a baby.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.881
Not so much anymore, unfortunately.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.716
Better lower that gun, Shelby.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.593
Well, first off, how about you tell me

01:33.677 --> 01:36.179
what you're planting inside my truck there,
Deputy Mooney?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.347
We got a tip you've been dealing.

01:39.975 --> 01:43.686
Well, how about you go ahead
and take it out right now?

01:45.272 --> 01:46.355
Slow.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.650
Putting a gun
on two uniformed sheriff deputies.

01:49.735 --> 01:53.529
We shot you down right now, Shelby,
we'd be within our rights.

01:54.865 --> 01:59.660
It wasn't two months ago
my doctor told me I got cancer in my liver.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.414
Two years to live, if I'm lucky.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.418
So if this is the way
the good Lord wants it to end,

02:07.503 --> 02:10.670
I consider myself prepared. How about you?

02:12.966 --> 02:16.052
Now, you're loyal to your sheriff,
and I appreciate that.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.514
I hope you're just as loyal to me
when I'm in his spot.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.600
Rest assured I won't send you
on no errands like this one.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.603
Like hell. Everybody knows
that you're in Boyd Crowder's pocket.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.271
Well, you believe what you like.

02:28.065 --> 02:32.318
The way I see it, this is my last chance
to make something of myself

02:32.402 --> 02:34.320
before I head to the wrong side of the grass.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.781
You gonna just let us leave?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.158
I'd say that sounds like a solid idea.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.785
Two guns against one.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.248
Well, that's impressive
you got them to stand down.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.376
Well, I told them I have liver cancer

03:31.169 --> 03:34.881
and I didn't mind taking one of them with me
if that's the way it had to go down.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.758
Of course, that's bullshit.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.138
Hell, I even told them
I'd keep them both on after I won.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.350
You tell Jimmy until this election's over,
I don't want him leaving Shelby's side.

03:46.435 --> 03:50.271
- Now, Boyd, I don't need...
- Shelby, please, this is bigger than just you.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
Now, we all got skin in this game.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.615
I'm gonna go get me a soda or something.

04:06.705 --> 04:11.500
Napier goes at our man like that,
we got to strike back hard.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.295
Let him know that he cannot push us around.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.214
You got any ideas?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.341
Napier's got a sister.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.055
I haven't seen her in a long time.
As far as I know, she's still breathing.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.183
I got a guy who could find her,
put the fear of God in her.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.063
No, I believe I'm gonna
take care of this one myself.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.774
So, the sheriff's sister, huh?

04:34.858 --> 04:37.318
I trust she wasn't too difficult to locate.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.404
Of course not. I'm just surprised, is all.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.658
Going after the man himself is one thing,
but going after his kin,

04:43.742 --> 04:48.120
now, that's awful nasty,
even in the midst of an election this fierce.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.624
Well, I appreciate your input.
What about that other thing?

04:52.084 --> 04:55.336
You sure do ask a lot of your banker,
Mr. Crowder.

04:56.296 --> 05:01.467
Given the fact that you are
a far cry from my best customer.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.221
Well, I admit my deposits
have been lower than I expected.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.765
That's one way to put it.

05:09.059 --> 05:12.770
Another way is you ain't gave me shit.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.648
Well, I was hoping you might see
past our balance sheet,

05:15.732 --> 05:19.568
look at the ancillary benefits
gonna come from this relationship.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.736
Such as?

05:20.821 --> 05:24.782
When every decision the Harlan County
Sheriff's Office makes goes through me.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.038
So you want someone
from the County Clerk's Office.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.749
But someone I can trust, now. implicitly.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.418
Implicitly.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.880
Would the county clerk himself fit that bill?

05:40.757 --> 05:41.924
Now you're talking.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.050
<i>Beach towels?</i>

05:43.468 --> 05:46.095
<i>There's 3 inches of water
down here, asshole!</i>

05:46.179 --> 05:48.139
All right, what do you
want me to do about it, Terry?

05:48.223 --> 05:49.348
<i>This never would have happened</i>

05:49.433 --> 05:51.767
<i>if you weren't too damn cheap
to keep this place up.</i>

05:51.852 --> 05:53.352
Yeah, I got to go. You call a plumber.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.645
- I'll get back to you.
- Don't you hang up...

05:54.730 --> 05:56.522
God, woman takes my house,

05:56.606 --> 05:59.275
then she calls me up to complain
about a goddamn busted pipe!

05:59.359 --> 06:01.152
<i>I'm still here, asshole.</i>

06:01.236 --> 06:02.486
Oh, man.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.614
What's your excuse?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.450
- I already seen it, Raylan.
- It's gonna happen?

06:07.534 --> 06:08.909
Yep. You know it is, or you wouldn't be here.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.829
He already got out once
under unjust circumstances.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.289
We gonna let it happen again?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.542
Yeah, well, sometimes,
you can flush all you want,

06:16.626 --> 06:20.629
but there's just that one floater
that just won't go down.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.591
You're the presiding judge.
Just make it go down.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.551
I'm bound and gagged by this one, son.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.888
Every ambulance-chasing lawyer in Kentucky
wants to take this case

06:28.972 --> 06:30.973
and sue the shit
out of the federal government

06:31.058 --> 06:32.391
for what happened to him at Tramble.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.435
Cry me a river. He got out of jail.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.228
- At gunpoint.
- So he says.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.065
- And Dewey Crowe backs him up.
- Angling for his own release, no doubt.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.817
Yeah, well, maybe we could ask
the crooked guards and nurses.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.444
No, wait, we can't. You killed them.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.780
I just shot the one nurse, the woman.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.576
Look. Just push it back a little while.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.329
Let me have some time
to find a reason to keep him in.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.791
Look, I know what he did to you
and I'm sorry but I can't help you.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.294
Now, you can try and convince the AUSA
to change their position.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.005
If you can't,
Dickie Bennett's gonna walk free.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.191
Hello, Hanna.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.528
Well, I've just been sitting here
admiring your tablescapes.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.031
I know who you are.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.616
Is that so?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.494
You're running that man
against my brother, Tillman, for sheriff.

08:15.871 --> 08:20.166
Well, for a woman who's been
off the beaten path for as long as you have,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.543
you certainly stay well-informed.

08:23.211 --> 08:29.091
Not from talking to Tillman. Okay?
We ain't talked regular going on 15 years.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.135
Well, you had a falling out, did you?

08:32.511 --> 08:35.847
I was laid up three months last year,
medical bills piling up sky high.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.851
Man wouldn't even return my phone calls.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.529
Well, a man who doesn't
take care of his family

08:50.614 --> 08:52.114
ain't much of a man in my book.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.826
So, you think he's gonna give a shit
if you slap me around?

08:55.911 --> 08:57.328
Hanna, you got me all wrong.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.332
I come here to offer you a job.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.548
- Mr. Vasquez.
- Raylan, I wish I could help, but I can't.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.759
- Dickie Bennett killed a woman.
- That's not what he's in for,

09:11.843 --> 09:13.552
and I can't keep him in prison
for the rest of his life

09:13.637 --> 09:14.678
because he whupped your ass.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.764
- First, I don't think that's a fair assessment.
- Regardless.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.391
Second, what if I give you a reason
to at least push the hearing back?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.476
Okay, what are we talking about?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.769
Thinking I go see Wade Messer,

09:21.853 --> 09:23.979
offer him leniency
for setting me up the way he did,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.648
and see what else he can finger Dickie on.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.650
Messer's not gonna talk to you.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.943
We're old buddies.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.321
- I offer him a reduced sentence...
- There's nothing to reduce.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.075
The only reason Messer's on the inside
is because he helped Dickie.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.161
- If we drop the charges against Dickie...
- Messer walks, too.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.205
Yeah, you've got no leverage
to make him tell you anything.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.539
Oh, shit.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.628
Look, Raylan, I'm not in the business
of letting assholes out of jail, okay,

09:47.712 --> 09:50.839
so if you got something real,
bring it to me and I'll listen to you.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.509
But otherwise,
the judge is gonna pardon Dickie.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.346
Always good to see you.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You taking actual shot glasses?

10:03.979 --> 10:07.982
No, put those back and
pull the goddamn Dixie cups that I bought.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.525
Good Lord.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.277
Shot of the cheap stuff for every vote,

10:11.361 --> 10:13.445
and a shot of the good stuff
if they bring a friend.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.490
Now, make sure you water down
that cheap stuff enough so it lasts.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.117
The boys I hired,
they know what they're doing.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.953
All right. Arlo's got a guy
hauling folks out of Paden Holler.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.413
That's good. And Emmett Holler?

10:22.497 --> 10:24.456
Well, Arlo's gonna make that run himself.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.958
Arlo's driving a bus?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.210
Oh, shit. Well, there's some folks
might not make it to the polls.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.254
Ava, baby, how are things on your end?

10:30.338 --> 10:33.590
The girls, they're excited to practice
their constitutional right to vote

10:33.675 --> 10:37.469
and to give a free hand job
for every vote cast for our man, Shelby.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.263
They already gave out blowjobs

10:39.347 --> 10:42.141
to a couple boys
Napier was counting on to haul for him

10:42.642 --> 10:44.977
and convinced them to take the day off.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.354
I'm not sure I ought to be listening to this.

10:47.439 --> 10:51.150
Well, Shelby, now,
this is the nature of Harlan County politics.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.653
Now, the people of Harlan County
are ready for a change.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.322
They deserve a change.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.781
And we gonna win this thing.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.033
- Yes, we are.
- Damn straight.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.617
Yes, we can.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.786
Hello? It is.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.709
You sure about that?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.253
You absolutely certain?

11:12.255 --> 11:15.424
No, of course not.
I appreciate the phone call.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.596
What is it?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.559
There's a chance that Dickie Bennett
might get out of Tramble this week.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.898
You don't think he's stupid enough
to come back to Harlan?

11:30.982 --> 11:35.611
Well, to answer your question,
cousin Johnny, yes, I think he is that stupid.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.281
But one victory at a time.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.538
Marshal.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.708
Jed, how was the drive over? Scenic?

11:49.793 --> 11:52.086
Seems like you guys
maybe took me the long way.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.214
They drove me over
through Masterson Station Park.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.718
Well, that was nice of them.
How are things at the Federal Inn?

11:59.928 --> 12:01.303
About what you'd expect.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.014
Yeah. Federal system's no picnic, is it?

12:04.808 --> 12:08.936
You get less rec time.
There's no chance of getting your own cell.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.979
Just got to hope
your roomie doesn't have IBS.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.943
Food's about the same grade of shit
everywhere, though, so there is that.

12:17.612 --> 12:18.904
Why am I here, Marshal?

12:18.988 --> 12:22.699
You saw Dickie Bennett pull the trigger,
so much as said so,

12:22.784 --> 12:25.411
then you changed your tune.
I need you to change it back.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.331
Well, in that case,
you better just put me back in that car.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.878
It's a pepperoni from Vitello's.
That's what your wife said, right?

12:35.672 --> 12:36.672
You saw her?

12:37.215 --> 12:39.425
I just spoke to her on the phone,

12:39.509 --> 12:42.970
but she became very upset,
so it was difficult to understand her.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.347
And you have a daughter, right?

12:46.307 --> 12:47.558
- Claire.
- Yeah.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.101
Yeah, she was crying, too.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.896
All I'm asking you to do is tell the truth, Jed.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.150
Then you can go home
and be with your family.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.281
I got an uncle, big man.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.284
Call him Stink.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.328
Look, I don't know the details,
but the story goes,

13:08.413 --> 13:12.624
some years back, Stink got involved
with Mags' cousin Gracie,

13:12.709 --> 13:15.294
got her knocked up, decided
he didn't want anything to do with that.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.672
Well, Gracie's brothers
didn't like that shit one bit.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.257
They was gonna kill him.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.012
So, Mags and my granny brokered a peace.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.307
You're saying your family
owes some debt to the Bennetts.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.727
Jed, there are no more Bennetts.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.021
Just Dickie.

13:34.105 --> 13:37.149
Yeah, what good
is that gonna do me now, huh?

13:37.233 --> 13:41.195
We're gonna need your granny to step up
and say Mags put the screws to her.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.530
Good luck.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.699
I get her to say it, you'll back her play?

13:46.409 --> 13:48.911
If she talks, I'll talk.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.664
Now...

13:56.211 --> 13:57.252
It's good.

14:02.926 --> 14:06.720
Ma'am, I am Deputy US Marshal
Raylan Givens.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.515
Now, she's getting better
at using this every day.

14:09.599 --> 14:13.143
See, now, how it works is

14:13.436 --> 14:18.398
she puts her fingers on the letters,
and then you write them down,

14:18.483 --> 14:20.359
- and so that's to...
- Okay. I think we'll manage.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.402
We're gonna talk about your grandson,
aren't we?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.655
Well, you know she can't talk, don't you?

14:24.739 --> 14:25.739
Yes, that's clear.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.075
Well, she had a stroke
couple weeks back, so...

14:28.159 --> 14:31.828
If you'll just give me a minute with her,
we'll be fine.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.497
All right, then.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.088
I understand Mags Bennett
called in an old debt.

14:41.172 --> 14:45.676
Why your Jed is wasting away behind bars
and not her Dickie.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.054
That's a milkshake.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.474
You want a milkshake?

15:02.110 --> 15:03.360
Two milkshakes?

15:08.157 --> 15:12.786
They did not have vanilla, just strawberry,
but it is made with real ice cream.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.079
How about that, huh?

15:15.081 --> 15:21.086
Okay. Now, as I was saying,
this debt you feel like you owe the Bennetts

15:21.170 --> 15:23.922
is no reason
for your grandson to rot in prison.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.048
You just have to...

15:25.133 --> 15:26.174
Oh, my...

15:41.357 --> 15:43.483
Funny. You know, before his stay at Tramble,

15:43.568 --> 15:46.153
I didn't think Dickie Bennett
had ever been out of Harlan County.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.904
Surprised me, too.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.948
All the way to Seattle.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.201
Fella's name is Corby Bennett,
but he goes by "Dickie."

15:53.286 --> 15:55.454
Just need a couple of days,
make sure it's not the same guy.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.956
Plus, Chief Deputy Sturm's
a good friend of Art's.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.833
Yeah, just trying to do him a favor.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.001
This guy's black.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.713
He looks black in the picture, but
you never know till you find him. Come on.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.132
He's not Derek Jeter black.
He's Wesley Snipes black.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.967
- This is a black man.
- Come on.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.637
You're mixing your metaphors there,
going from athletes to actors.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.140
Yeah. Next time,
go Derek Jeter to Sammy Sosa.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.642
More like Deron Williams to...

16:16.726 --> 16:18.143
Doesn't matter. This is not gonna happen.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.686
Fine. I'm gonna give him the tour.

16:19.771 --> 16:20.854
Raylan, please.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.482
No, I'll go over there first thing
tomorrow morning. I'll do it myself.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.692
When they show up to get him,
he's not there. It's no one's fault.

16:25.777 --> 16:26.818
It happens all the time.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.655
The answer is no. Ship has sailed.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.074
You know what?
I bet if he had killed one of your loved ones,

16:32.158 --> 16:33.241
you'd be trying a little harder.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.744
Raylan, we're all on the same side here.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.454
Now, I know you're frustrated,

16:37.538 --> 16:41.333
but delay tactics will only dismantle
all the work I've done to prevent a lawsuit.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.503
If that happens,
all of our asses are in a sling.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.505
Great. So, that's it, huh? He walks?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.674
Yeah. He walks. Unless you get on the stand.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.425
- Who can take the stand?
- You could take the stand.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.843
Tell the judge all the things you told me.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.053
I don't know. Maybe he goes out on a limb.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.556
Maybe he takes your side on it.
Either that, or this little shit's gonna walk.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.143
You know, that's not a bad idea.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.353
What?

17:01.437 --> 17:05.107
The victim,
a highly decorated Deputy US Marshal,

17:05.191 --> 17:07.567
makes an impassioned plea before the judge.

17:07.652 --> 17:11.279
Tell him Dickie Bennett tried to torture you.
Maybe the judge will see it your way.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.656
No.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.535
What's the matter? You've testified before.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.203
It's never gone well.

17:20.623 --> 17:25.127
Well, try picturing the judge in his Speedos.
That's always worked for me.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.298
I haven't won yet. Haven't won yet.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.427
Well, from the looks of it,
you're gonna need one either way, Shelby.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.388
We better win.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.516
I never handed out
so much pineapple juice in my life.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.642
Pineapple juice?

17:40.727 --> 17:44.688
It makes... It makes the taste
a little more tolerable.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.535
Hello? I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.579
Hey, everybody, shut up!

18:02.165 --> 18:05.625
Well, that's it? That's the official count?

18:09.756 --> 18:10.839
Napier won.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.550
Shit.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.562
From what I hear, the prime spots
for the Oxy clinics are by bridges

18:25.646 --> 18:29.983
or, of course,
any place where two hollers intersect.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.362
What exactly is the origin of that word?
"Hollers."

18:34.655 --> 18:36.865
It's meant to denote "hollows,"
I would imagine,

18:36.949 --> 18:40.494
but it's not like those are actually
hollowed into the mountains, are they?

18:40.578 --> 18:42.120
Hell if I know.

18:46.626 --> 18:51.630
You know, Tillman, it's gonna start
to get a little crowded in here,

18:51.714 --> 18:52.881
for the both of us, I mean.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.134
And I've noticed that you have
an empty office down the hall

18:56.219 --> 18:58.470
that you're using for storage.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.890
You think you could have your shit
moved in there by the end of the week?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.058
What?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.143
Your shit, moved by weekend.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.270
Just a damn minute.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.856
I can't give you an office.
You don't work here.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.192
Well, I'd imagine you could
find me a nice job on your staff,

19:12.276 --> 19:13.568
non-deputized, of course.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.905
I mean, I have to keep my eyes on things
if we are gonna make this work.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.323
- Whoa.
- "Whoa"?

19:19.283 --> 19:20.450
Come in.

19:21.911 --> 19:22.994
Tillman.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.704
- What can I do for you, Harvey?
- Harvey.

19:24.789 --> 19:25.914
Sir.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.168
I'm afraid it's bad news.

19:30.253 --> 19:34.214
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Well, now, yeah, see, that's the thing.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.383
There's a problem with the election results.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.509
A problem?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.177
Well, it seems

19:40.429 --> 19:44.266
your sister, Hanna, is on my office payroll.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.353
Now, it's minor administrative position,

19:48.437 --> 19:53.149
but state of Kentucky's nepotism laws
being what they are,

19:53.234 --> 19:56.194
well, it makes you
ineligible for county office, so.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.364
Now, just a goddamn minute, Harvey.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.200
You know I hadn't seen Hanna
since she stole from Mama.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.203
Well, now, calm down, Tillman.
Now, I know. And I fired her.

20:05.288 --> 20:09.583
I fired her as soon as it come down,
but law's law, so.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.543
All right, then.
Void the election. Call a new one.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.629
Now, but see, the problem, though, is,

20:15.214 --> 20:17.257
according to the statute,

20:17.842 --> 20:21.386
the runner-up now serves as sheriff,
effective immediately,

20:21.470 --> 20:23.430
until we can hold another vote, so.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.600
Okay. Fine. When's the new election?

20:27.310 --> 20:30.645
Well, probably not for three months at least.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.063
Bullshit, Harvey!

20:32.148 --> 20:33.398
Well, now, I did not write this law, Tillman.

20:33.482 --> 20:37.193
- And how much he and Crowder paying you?
- Now, it ain't like that.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.237
You shaking us down for more money?
Is that what this is?

20:39.322 --> 20:40.697
I'm personally offended by that.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.657
- Excuse me.
- You're welcome, sir.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.409
Now, my hands are tied.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.957
You're a lucky man, Mr. Quarles.

20:52.209 --> 20:56.504
You get to come all the way down here,
a place you got no right being.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.716
You get to eat our food.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.011
You get to drink our whiskey.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.014
You get to look at our women

21:06.682 --> 21:09.392
as you try to take it all for yourself.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.437
Why, you know what you are?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.106
You're a conquistador.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.318
Only we are not your savages.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.405
And now you get to leave with your life.

21:23.199 --> 21:28.495
Well, I'm hard-pressed to remember the last
outsider in your line of work could say that.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.457
I hope you've enjoyed your stay

21:32.541 --> 21:35.377
and you never forget who packed your bags.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.911
How long have you been taking those?

22:12.873 --> 22:17.043
Mr. Quarles, maybe it is time
you leave Kentucky.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.425
I got nowhere else to go.

22:34.937 --> 22:35.979
It's some kid.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.355
See what he wants.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.774
May I help you?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.071
- Good call.
- Yeah.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.407
Sit down. Over there.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.958
There's a young man with a gun
in our trailer, Wynn.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.251
Yeah, I noticed.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.755
- Did you do something to upset him?
- I don't even know him.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.591
- You and me got a friend in common.
- Oh, yeah?

23:04.675 --> 23:05.967
Brady Hughes.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.094
Who's Brady Hughes?

23:11.015 --> 23:12.807
Go ahead. Tell him.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.853
You're friends with Brady?

23:16.937 --> 23:20.440
Friends enough to know that the last person
anyone saw him with was you,

23:20.524 --> 23:22.442
getting into a car together.

23:22.902 --> 23:27.489
- Brady is a beautiful soul.
- I don't want to hear your bullshit.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.491
What would you like to hear?

23:29.575 --> 23:32.577
The truth.
I want you to admit that you killed him.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.079
But that's not the truth.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.163
Then where is he?

23:35.664 --> 23:36.831
I don't know.

23:37.333 --> 23:41.836
Yes, you do.
You killed him. And I want to hear you say it.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.005
And then you're gonna kill me?

23:44.840 --> 23:45.965
Say it.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.218
- How old are you, son?
- Old enough.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.261
Nineteen? Twenty?

23:51.180 --> 23:54.015
I was 14 years old when I killed my first man.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.102
I was given a choice. I could do it myself,
or they would do it for me.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.020
You took him from me.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.858
No. I didn't.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.825
My father was a heroin addict.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.870
He wasn't necessarily an evil man,

24:17.039 --> 24:21.042
but he couldn't kick his addiction,
couldn't hold a job, either.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.630
But to feed his addiction,
he used the resources at his disposal.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.591
I don't care about your shit!

24:28.676 --> 24:33.888
Luckily for my father,
he had a very pretty little boy.

24:36.016 --> 24:39.477
And plenty of men were willing
to pay for my company. What is your name?

24:41.063 --> 24:42.480
Donovan.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.568
That's what it was like for me, Donovan.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.113
For many years.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.034
And then one day, a man named Theo
realized what was happening.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.954
You see, Theo believed deeply in family.

24:58.914 --> 25:03.751
And one afternoon, an associate of Theo's
picked me up from school,

25:03.836 --> 25:06.296
and we took a ride in his Cadillac
to a warehouse.

25:07.047 --> 25:11.968
Theo ushered me in,
where inside, on his knees, was my father.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.514
I was 14 years old.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.978
And I remember how it felt
to suddenly be free.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.941
You see, Donovan,
I understood your friend Brady.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.695
I knew him without really knowing him.
Do you understand?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.656
Then why'd you hurt him?

25:34.533 --> 25:35.825
Hurt him?

25:37.411 --> 25:39.412
No, son. I never hurt him.

25:40.831 --> 25:44.876
I did everything I could to help him.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.602
And then I set him free.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.277
I set him free.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.579
So, did you screw up or something?

26:21.664 --> 26:24.415
No. Actually, this time, I did everything right.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.960
So, what's the problem?

26:27.044 --> 26:30.213
Were you not listening when I said
the part about the murderer going free?

26:30.547 --> 26:31.756
Watch your tone, trouble.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.010
You know what I think the problem is?

26:37.179 --> 26:39.180
You have performance anxiety.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.225
I can assure you, Lindsey, I do not.

26:42.685 --> 26:46.521
Although, I will admit, public speaking
is not my favorite part of this job.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.106
You need to buck up, sadness.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.108
You are sounding like
a glass-half-empty kind of guy.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.069
Right now I'm
a glass-completely-empty kind of guy.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.654
You know what I think?

26:55.864 --> 26:56.990
I think you ought to let me help you.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.867
Help me make my statement?

27:00.452 --> 27:01.577
What do you got so far?

27:05.082 --> 27:07.625
"I am Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens."

27:07.710 --> 27:09.669
- That's a strong opening. What's next?
- That's it.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.213
The rest is bullshit.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.300
I mean, the whole thing is bullshit.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.886
Getting up, talking.
Telling folks shit they already know.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.139
Trying to say it in a way
that gives them permission

27:21.223 --> 27:23.599
to make a decision
they should've made already.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.268
You're not much of a bullshitter, huh?

27:25.894 --> 27:27.312
I'd like to think not.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.646
I used to have that same problem.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.692
I got to the age
where all my friends were getting married,

27:32.776 --> 27:36.529
and seems like I had to give a different toast
at a different wedding every weekend.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.532
Marriages I knew
weren't gonna last more than a month.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.035
I would get a migraine
until the moment I stood up.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.163
Did you know
this is not a very encouraging story thus far?

27:45.247 --> 27:48.249
I know. What I figured out was,

27:49.585 --> 27:51.085
don't bullshit.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.173
I mean, sure, they would give me nasty looks

27:55.257 --> 27:58.217
when I stood up and didn't say the
same old shit that everybody wanted to hear.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.219
I would get the stink eye
even after I sat down,

28:00.304 --> 28:04.098
but it stopped the migraines,
and I could respect myself in the morning.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.310
You know what I think?

28:07.728 --> 28:09.771
I think you should give my statement.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.481
See, I thought they'd probably
rather hear it from

28:11.565 --> 28:13.399
somebody who's actually
in law enforcement.

28:13.484 --> 28:16.694
Yeah, well, I can fix that.
I could deputize you.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.197
Shut up. You can do that?

28:19.281 --> 28:21.824
I sure can. If you'd like me to.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.494
And I could arrest people, carry a gun?

28:24.578 --> 28:28.206
Well, probably start you off with handcuffs,
more basic activities.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.540
Well, shit. I'm ready. Let's do it.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.376
- Right now?
- Right here.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.753
You don't think we should wait
for these people to leave?

28:33.837 --> 28:36.172
Well, I feel like if we wait for that,
you'll be face down on the bar

28:36.256 --> 28:37.965
and no good to me at all.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.593
I might surprise you.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.388
- You know those two?
- Yeah, I do.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.931
One looks like an albino deer.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.642
He's been in here before, right?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.352
Yeah, he has.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.606
Knock yourself out. I'll be back.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.487
Hi.

29:00.948 --> 29:04.909
Bourbon, please. Neat.
Duffy, how do you take yours?

29:04.993 --> 29:08.037
- I'm sorry. We are closed.
- Sure doesn't look closed.

29:08.122 --> 29:12.583
- Yeah, well, we are. We're closed.
- That's right. He's the bouncer now.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.419
Wynn, take him out of here.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.463
I voiced my concerns,
and they fell on deaf ears.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.090
You got two minutes.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.384
Marshal, aren't you gonna ask me
what I want?

29:21.468 --> 29:22.927
I don't think I will, no.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.263
There was an election today
in Harlan County.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.683
And your man Boyd Crowder
pulled a fast one on me.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.103
He slipped that hillbilly rug
right out from under my feet.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.897
I'm just gonna file that under,
"Who gives a shit?"

29:34.982 --> 29:38.443
Well, now, usually, I'd be in a position
to handle something like that

29:38.527 --> 29:39.819
because that's what I do.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.487
But then I got to thinking

29:41.572 --> 29:44.532
I'd still have to worry
about incurring your wrath.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.367
I'm sorry. My wrath?

29:47.369 --> 29:50.121
You don't need to worry about that.
You guys can take each other out.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.206
- And your father?
- Sure. Him, too.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.666
Take them both out.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.877
And that's why you are
the way you are, Raylan.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.422
'Cause your daddy's a criminal.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.258
That's it. Your two minutes are up.

30:04.428 --> 30:08.139
I understand you've been snooping around
about my friend Brady Hughes.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.851
Brady Hughes?
Who's that? That the street kid you killed?

30:11.935 --> 30:13.895
Gentlemen, everything okay?

30:14.313 --> 30:17.982
Everything's okay.
Just stay behind the bar, will you?

30:18.066 --> 30:20.651
You know, I decided upon
something tonight, there, Jim Bob.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.737
- Did you?
- I did.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.156
But I wanted to come down here
and tell it to you myself,

30:25.240 --> 30:26.365
right out of the horse's mouth.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.783
Sure that wasn't necessary.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.619
I'm gonna kill you, Raylan.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.456
Maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow,

30:33.540 --> 30:35.124
but some day
you'll be walking down the street,

30:35.209 --> 30:37.293
and I'm gonna put a bullet
right in the back of your skull,

30:37.377 --> 30:38.920
and you're gonna drop.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.935
US Marshal. I want everybody
out of the building right now.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.437
Get your stuff and get out.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.321
Why wait?

31:08.033 --> 31:09.575
Okay. You had your fun. Let's go.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.536
I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.913
So, how long you think it'll take
before the cops get here?

31:13.997 --> 31:17.208
They may not even come.
I did show my badge.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.168
And how do we do this?

31:19.753 --> 31:22.004
You draw. I put you down.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.594
- What are you doing?
- Shut your goddamn mouth.

31:31.974 --> 31:36.477
Marshal, it seems like
I'm a little outnumbered in this situation.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.438
I want you and your friend out of here.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.400
Lindsey, I want you to put that gun down.

31:42.484 --> 31:46.237
Raylan, don't talk to me like I'm a waitress.
This is my bar and I want them out.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.030
She just sassed you, son.

31:48.865 --> 31:52.451
You think I can't paint that wall with you
from here, you are sorely mistaken.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.704
So if I pull on your gal there...

31:55.038 --> 31:58.874
No, don't do that.
I'm really starting to like her.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.299
Don't forget what I said, Marshal.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.345
Night-night.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.180
Ma'am.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.529
Well, now what?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.560
You know, you're welcome to stay
if you want.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.564
That's sweet of you to offer,
but you got a lot going on.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.484
You got that statement to write,

33:06.568 --> 33:07.777
baby on the way.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.865
You got a sonogram picture
taped to your bathroom mirror.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.033
I'm sorry.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.162
I'm not married,
if that's what you're wondering.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.790
- She kicked you out?
- Why would you say that?

33:20.874 --> 33:23.042
You just moved in above a college bar.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.502
You got men trying to kill you.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.337
It's complicated.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.341
I mean, no, it's not. Yes, she left me.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.176
Does that happen often?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.511
Women leaving me?

33:33.595 --> 33:36.097
No, men coming in bars, trying to kill you.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.767
One of the hazards of being a marshal,
I guess.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.520
Sure it's not just one of the hazards
of being you?

33:42.604 --> 33:45.189
Is this all part of the pep talk again?

33:45.273 --> 33:47.900
- How is that speech going?
- It's pretty good.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.195
"I'm Raylan Givens.
I've been a marshal 19 years.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.281
"Currently, I'm based
out of the Lexington office."

33:55.075 --> 33:57.952
There's gonna be more. I'm gonna work on it.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.122
Later.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.507
- Cowboy junkies.
- Yeah, I've heard of them.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.007
Hey, there he is.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.219
Oh, no. Now what?

34:15.303 --> 34:18.013
Am I about to be sentenced
to be Dickie's manservant?

34:18.348 --> 34:20.181
No, I got a good feeling about today.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.101
And it's just a feeling
'cause no one actually spoke to the judge.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.228
- Hell, no. That'd be collusion.
- Right.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.733
But I got a feeling if you give your testimony
and it's in English,

34:28.817 --> 34:32.277
that Judge Reardon's gonna be inclined
to keep Dickie Bennett behind bars.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.987
Great.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.074
- You worked on your testimony, right?
- Yeah.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.618
Make some grown men cry.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.413
Your Honor, what I'm saying is, I just...

34:42.496 --> 34:46.250
I do not want my fellow prisoners to have to
go through what I went through, you see?

34:46.333 --> 34:49.085
'Cause these gentlemen,
they ain't just convicts to me.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.588
They are my family, okay?

34:50.672 --> 34:53.632
They're my new family. You understand?

34:53.717 --> 34:58.679
So, what I'm trying to say is,
I've changed, Your Honor. I've changed.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.890
I mean, my new family has changed me.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.809
I have dedicated my life
to make sure this kind of

35:03.894 --> 35:07.146
Abu Ghraiby bullshit don't happen again
up inside here.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.106
Okay, I think we get the point, Mr. Bennett.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.234
So, I've changed. Believe me.

35:12.319 --> 35:15.613
You've changed.
Thank you for saying it one more time.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.031
Amen.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.657
Take a seat, Mr. Bennett.

35:20.494 --> 35:22.119
Now, before I make my ruling,

35:22.204 --> 35:27.625
the victim of the very transgression
that landed Mr. Bennett in Tramble

35:27.709 --> 35:29.210
has asked to make a statement,

35:29.294 --> 35:31.921
and I see no reason
to deny him that opportunity.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.506
Marshal.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.019
Can I just make my statement
from here, Your Honor?

35:52.400 --> 35:55.736
I am Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.696
I've been a marshal for 19 years.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.074
I'm currently assigned
to the Lexington office.

36:04.871 --> 36:08.457
I am here today
on behalf of the Marshals Service

36:08.542 --> 36:11.001
because we feel strongly

36:11.086 --> 36:15.089
that Dickie Bennett is not worthy of
the pardon being considered by this court.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.345
I'm not gonna talk about his entire rap sheet.

36:21.429 --> 36:24.348
It's so extensive, I think it'd be just
a waste of the court's time.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.308
And I won't talk about his family, either.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.519
I can only tell you that
none of them are here today

36:28.603 --> 36:32.022
because they have all been
killed in the commission of crimes

36:32.107 --> 36:34.149
or otherwise incarcerated.

36:36.236 --> 36:40.823
I'll just talk about the incident
that led Dickie to his current stay in prison

36:42.909 --> 36:44.451
and that which caused me

36:46.830 --> 36:49.456
great pain and suffering.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.462
I mean, all things considered, I'm fine.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.717
And, quite honestly, this might be
a waste of the court's time, as well.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.595
We all know what's gonna happen
if we release Dickie Bennett.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.305
More blood's gonna be spilled.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.473
If not his, someone else's.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.020
He's a thug

37:12.856 --> 37:15.733
who is trying to convince us he's a victim.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.110
A victim of a flaw in the system.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.780
Well, I think he's a flaw in the system.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.410
But then again,
what the hell do I know, right?

37:26.494 --> 37:29.872
I just mostly chase fugitives.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.375
And I enjoy it. So...

37:36.087 --> 37:38.172
What the hell? Let him out.

37:39.174 --> 37:42.176
Release him back into the wild.
He's just gonna screw up again,

37:42.260 --> 37:45.012
and when he does,
law enforcement will be there,

37:45.096 --> 37:48.307
and we'll just haul his ass
right back to prison.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.518
Assuming he's not killed in the process.

37:56.650 --> 37:57.733
Thank you, Your Honor.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.033
Did that go the way you rehearsed it?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.202
You got anything more to add, Counselor?

38:10.038 --> 38:14.792
In that case, I have no choice
but to grant Dickie Bennett early release

38:14.876 --> 38:19.213
based on the terms and conditions
of the deal set forth today.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.801
Mr. Bennett, once the paperwork
is processed, you're a free man.

38:23.885 --> 38:24.927
Yes... I'm...

38:25.011 --> 38:26.679
Session is adjourned.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.013
Amen.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.479
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.524
Figured this way, it would just
save the taxpayers a lawsuit,

38:38.608 --> 38:41.151
and maybe Dickie leads us
to that Bennett money.

38:41.236 --> 38:45.990
Win-win.

38:46.074 --> 38:49.660
Next time you tell me you're not
good at something, I'm gonna believe you.

38:49.744 --> 38:54.164
- You know when he's getting out?
- Next day or two, from what I understand.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.208
That damn Dickie Bennett.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.170
Released to be a thorn in my side yet again.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.925
That is one lucky, squirrelly,
little son of a bitch.

39:07.303 --> 39:11.015
You know, they used to call this
hog-killing weather.

39:11.099 --> 39:16.270
Back before refrigeration,
you could not kill a pig in the summertime.

39:17.439 --> 39:20.482
No, that meat wouldn't last you long enough
to be worth your while.

39:21.609 --> 39:25.654
Yep, sweet spot is late autumn,
just before the cold sets in.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.241
Nearly impossible to butcher that meat
when it freezes up on you.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.659
If Dickie sniffs around long enough,

39:30.744 --> 39:33.245
he's gonna figure out
where his mama's money's at.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.663
And with that much cheddar on the table,

39:34.748 --> 39:37.541
plenty of people
gonna be willing to help him go after it.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.253
Now, you want,
we put Bernard on the bridge.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.047
Ain't nobody gonna miss Dickie Bennett.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.509
You think people who buy their meat
in cellophane packages got any idea

39:47.594 --> 39:52.181
what it's like to see an animal born,
raised up and selected to be killed?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.643
I imagine most people
try not to think about that.

39:57.479 --> 40:00.189
When he shows up, you bring him to me.

40:02.484 --> 40:05.069
What if he don't like what you have to say?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.989
- Roger.
- Yes, Mr. Limehouse.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.159
- That one.
- Yes, sir.

40:13.244 --> 40:17.081
People will conspire to keep you down.

40:17.165 --> 40:21.376
You will reach for the edge, and they will
lean the heel of their boots on your fingers,

40:21.461 --> 40:26.423
and you just keep fighting
and scratching and pulling,

40:26.508 --> 40:29.468
and just when you think
you've reached the top of the mountain,

40:29.552 --> 40:31.470
they changed the rules.

40:32.222 --> 40:35.849
And then you have to start
from the beginning, so what do you do?

40:37.519 --> 40:38.769
I know what you don't do.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.438
You don't quit. You don't run.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.774
You don't stick that gun
in the back of your throat.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.400
You realize that you were wrong.

40:45.485 --> 40:49.029
You were wrong in thinking
that you had already won.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.366
You claw your way back into the fight.

40:53.034 --> 40:57.830
True victory is when
you crush your opponent so completely

40:58.373 --> 41:02.543
that he realizes that he was wrong
in opposing you from the beginning.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.132
And you stand on the top of the mountain.
