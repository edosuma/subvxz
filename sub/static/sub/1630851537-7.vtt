WEBVTT

00:12.053 --> 00:13.263
-Got you.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.307
Got you.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.393
Ooh, got you again.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.769
You're really good at this.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.856
I have surprisingly
good reflexes for a non-athlete.

00:22.939 --> 00:26.609
And you have surprisingly bad reflexes
for someone with 0% body fat.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.655
-Oh!
-Guys.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.365
It's a letter for Cody Briggs!

00:32.449 --> 00:34.367
-Cody Briggs!
-Yeah, who?

00:34.451 --> 00:36.786
I have a date with pottery Dave.
But I'll cancel.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.164
He'll understand.
I mean, it's Cody Briggs!

00:39.247 --> 00:42.584
-Who's that now?
-Guys. We got a letter for Cody Briggs!

00:42.667 --> 00:44.210
-And that is…?

00:44.294 --> 00:45.837
Cody Briggs!

00:45.920 --> 00:48.006
Start drinking your electrolytes, people.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.382
It's a Cody Briggs night!

00:49.466 --> 00:50.717
-Yes!

00:51.593 --> 00:53.720
Who…? Hi. Who is Cody Briggs?

00:53.803 --> 00:56.306
-Who is Cody Briggs, you ask?
-I did. Like ten times.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.725
-I can't wait to tell you.
-Then just tell me!

01:08.526 --> 01:10.445
It all started three years ago.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.864
I had a very not okay look at the time.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.824
Thank God you can't see a flashback.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.080
We'd all moved in
a few months earlier

01:20.163 --> 01:23.708
when a strange package came
for a former tenant.

01:24.834 --> 01:28.671
Hey. Do any of you guys
know somebody named Cody Briggs?

01:28.755 --> 01:29.756
-No.
-I don't think so.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.174
He must have lived here before us.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.844
We got a package for him
and it's from Ferrari.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.472
Well, it's someone else's mail,
so we probably shouldn't.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.556
It's a key chain.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.184
Who is this Cody Briggs?

01:41.267 --> 01:42.310
Okay.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.355
I bet Cody Briggs is a dream zaddy,

01:45.438 --> 01:48.274
driving around in his top-down Ferrari,
silver fox hair,

01:48.358 --> 01:52.195
except his chest hair,
which is black as night.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.366
Yeah. And I bet he made his money

01:56.449 --> 02:00.620
using science to develop new
and exciting ways to make women orgasm.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.706
He's like a sex scientist.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.669
Sounds like Cody's living the life.
To Cody Briggs.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.796
Okay, hang on.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.840
I think we just invented a drinking game.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.216
-Yeah!
-Hell, yeah!

02:13.299 --> 02:16.427
Okay, Claire.
Make up something else about Cody.

02:16.511 --> 02:20.348
Okay, well, when he's not helping women
achieve ultimate pleasure,

02:20.431 --> 02:23.351
he's breeding exotic fruit combinations

02:23.434 --> 02:28.064
like appretines, and papples,
and crananaberries.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.482
To Cody!

02:29.566 --> 02:31.234
Grant, you go.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.029
And Cody sold his life rights in the '80s.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.366
Turns out, they made
a little movie based on him called,

02:38.449 --> 02:40.910
oh, I don't know, Top Gun!

02:43.246 --> 02:45.123
To Cody!

02:46.082 --> 02:48.877
With each piece of mail,
we unlock a new part of Cody's story.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.214
Behold the Cody Briggs universe. Ta-da!

02:54.257 --> 02:55.717
It's super easy to play.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.511
Yeah, it's an impossible thing
to be bad at.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.681
Give it a try.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.725
Okay, okay, all right.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.810
An ASPCA flyer.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.272
All right, so Cody had a dog…

03:09.355 --> 03:10.481
-Ooh, yes.
-Great.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.358
…that he loved so much…

03:12.442 --> 03:13.735
Aw!

03:13.818 --> 03:16.696
…but he didn't know that little Lester

03:16.779 --> 03:19.657
was being eaten inside out
by stomach cancer.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.075
Oh, my God.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.203
And by the time he found out,

03:23.286 --> 03:29.417
it was inoperable,
so he started donating to the ASPCA

03:29.500 --> 03:33.463
to clear his conscience,
but sadly, it didn't work.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.592
So it is possible to be bad at it.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.221
That's on me. I forgot to explain.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.057
It's supposed to not be
the saddest thing you can think of.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.810
For example,
here's a snorkeling school brochure

03:47.894 --> 03:51.689
addressed to Cody Briggs
and a woman named Ramona Delgado.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.151
We think Ramona Delgado
is the love of Cody's life,

03:55.235 --> 03:58.029
who he met on an underwater
snorkeling expedition.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.157
We each drank a beautiful box
of Pinot that night.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.743
Oh, and Claire held my hair as I threw up.

04:04.369 --> 04:08.706
Looking back, that first Cody Briggs night
was the first time we bonded as friends.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.000
And now you get to be a part of that.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.336
Well, that's very kind, Grant,

04:13.419 --> 04:16.381
but it's a little hard to jump
right into a three-year inside joke

04:16.464 --> 04:19.759
as evidenced by my initial attempt.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.845
So I should probably sit this one out.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.474
Come on, Chelsea,
it would mean so much to me if you played.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.434
Oh.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.061
Okay, all right.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.354
I will play.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.897
-Yes!
-Yeah. All right.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.315
You'll be great, don't worry.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.068
Yeah, just don't kill any more pets.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.158
Look at you, Chelsea,
finally part of a group

04:44.242 --> 04:46.661
that doesn't have the word
"study" in front of it.

04:46.744 --> 04:47.662
You've made it.

04:47.745 --> 04:51.582
Real friends, inside jokes,
drinking games.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.293
Hope you don't screw it up.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.671
You saw how important this is to Grant.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.381
If you mess it up, it'll destroy him.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.509
He's strong but he's fragile.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.261
Oh, God, the pressure.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.056
There it is. The Cody Briggs mail.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.434
Take a little peak
so you can prepare some fun ideas.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.811
That way you won't dog cancer
all over the night.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.651
Chelsea, you pathetic dork,
you've really gotta get into therapy.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.528
Yeah, we've been saying that for years.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.741
-Chelsea, do you wanna--?
-Hello! Nothing is happening.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.534
Okay.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.455
Just warming my back against
the stove like a log cabin dweller.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.915
Oh, my God, Chelsea, something's on fire.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.959
Oh, no, no, no.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.669
No, no, no!

05:39.339 --> 05:42.133
Is that the Cody Briggs mail?

05:42.216 --> 05:44.052
Oh, God.

05:44.135 --> 05:47.513
The one thing I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.349
Irony, you wicked bitch.

05:50.558 --> 05:55.688
Okay, so it does look like
you ruined Cody Briggs night,

05:55.772 --> 05:59.275
and it may be months before we get
any more Cody mail, but it's okay.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.193
No.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.653
No, it is not okay.

06:03.404 --> 06:07.116
Claire, making friends has always
been easy for you, but not for me.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.827
And I cannot be the reason
tonight is ruined.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.663
-I have to fix this.
-Well, great.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.666
Great, well, we'll fix it together.
It'll be an SBFF adventure.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.585
We'll call it Morgan's Eleven.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.922
-There's only two of us.
-A prequel, I like it, Morgan's Two.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.216
Okay, fine.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.307
This is so exciting. A mail heist.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.684
It is not a mail heist.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.687
Okay, but every sister adventure
needs disguises,

06:36.771 --> 06:38.398
so here, I brought you a mustache.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.607
Get away from me.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.443
Next!

06:43.277 --> 06:44.737
Afternoon…

06:44.821 --> 06:45.947
Irma.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.490
That is a beautiful name.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.158
Can I help you?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.618
Sure.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.204
After all, we are just two regular people.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.583
I'm just here for my mail.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.170
I figured I'd save the postal worker
a trip and cut out the middleman.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.341
Not that I'm trying to eliminate your job.
I highly value you.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.093
And your name.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.553
Cody Briggs.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.265
Okay, I have the Van Nuys address.

07:12.348 --> 07:16.185
Yes, the Van Nuys address.
Yes, that's where I live.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.771
Van Nuys is beautiful this time of year.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.649
ID please.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.067
ID.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.528
Right, of course you'd need ID.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.614
Ah! Look, lady, we are not here
for a drink, okay?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.324
We just want some mail.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.953
If you don't have ID,
then I can't give you your--

07:34.036 --> 07:35.663
Yeah, Irma…

07:36.164 --> 07:39.542
I don't expect you to understand this,
but it is very important to me

07:40.084 --> 07:43.463
and this French lady
that we get Cody Briggs' junk mail.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.964
Oui.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.217
Opening someone else's mail
is a federal crime.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.052
I suggest you both leave.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.095
Now!

07:51.179 --> 07:52.597
Next!

07:52.680 --> 07:54.015
Well, we tried.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.811
218 Melbourne Ave.
Remember, 218 Melbourne Ave.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.438
-Excuse me!
-Go, go, go!

08:00.521 --> 08:02.482
We heisted. We heisted!

08:05.276 --> 08:08.237
So pumped
for Chelsea's first Cody Briggs night.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.698
Yeah, you've been talking
about her all day.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.617
Really?

08:13.242 --> 08:15.745
Oh, I'm just excited
that she gets to join in.

08:16.954 --> 08:20.374
Oh, my God, you guys. A troll
is tearing me apart in my comments.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.085
Isn't that great?

08:24.545 --> 08:25.963
I thought trolls were bad.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.383
No, not only is having
a troll not bad, it's fantastic.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.302
You're no one online if you're not hated.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.721
I've never felt this accomplished.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.889
Oh.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.516
Congrats, Jayden.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.060
I haven't seen you this happy
since you got randomly seated

08:39.143 --> 08:41.270
in that Splash Mountain log
with Benedict Cumberbatch.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.605
Ah! Tsk.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.106
So much splashing.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.736
Wait a second. Where's the Cody mail?

08:48.819 --> 08:49.779
I don't know.

08:49.862 --> 08:50.988
I didn't touch it.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.908
My vanity simply wouldn't allow me
to do anything but refresh my feed.

08:53.991 --> 08:58.579
Oh, no. I went through the mail earlier
to get rid of all the non-Cody stuff,

08:58.663 --> 09:01.082
coupons, magazines, parking tickets.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.500
You know, junk.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.212
I must have accidentally
thrown out Cody's mail.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.590
Okay. So we need to find
a new piece of Cody mail.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.593
-I'll use my crystals to summon one.
-Great. Do it now.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.887
No, Grant. You can't rush these.

09:14.971 --> 09:19.058
Crystals only work if you don't expect
immediate, tangible or measurable results.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.144
We don't have time, Solana.
We have to go to the source of the mail.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.855
-The mailman.
-Where the mailman gets the mail.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.525
-The mailman office.
-Post office.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.193
There it is. Okay, let's go.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.489
Okay.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.533
All right. This is the address.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.493
Why are you walking like that?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.496
I'm walking normally
so no one knows what we're up to.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.165
Yeah, that's not-- Okay.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.503
Let's just do a quick rifle
through Cody's mailbox,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.338
find some junk mail he won't miss,

09:49.422 --> 09:52.133
take it back to the house,
pretend none of this happened.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.594
What the hell has become of my life?

09:55.553 --> 09:59.181
-Oh, great day, isn't it?
-Yeah, no robbers in this neighborhood.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.019
And… applesauce!

10:03.102 --> 10:03.978
What?

10:04.061 --> 10:06.522
Applesauce. It's our code word for "go."

10:06.606 --> 10:09.108
-We didn't talk about a code word.
-Who did I talk to about it?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.735
All right, Claire, let's just…

10:11.277 --> 10:12.820
-Applesauce.
-Okay.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.243
Damn it, it's empty.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.121
If we can't take his mail,
let's get something else.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.707
His gnome.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.292
Perfect.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.212
Stop right there!

10:30.296 --> 10:31.797
-Crap.
-It's him.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.299
The real Cody Briggs.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.514
Remember how I said
I have a troll and that it was great?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.350
Now it's not great!

10:43.309 --> 10:45.186
My troll has gone way too far.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.479
He's attacking my…

10:47.521 --> 10:48.481
ankles!

10:49.106 --> 10:51.400
Your ankles? They're totally normal.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.110
Oh, don't humor me.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.156
You know they're hideous. Look at them.
They're all bone.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.369
When Jayden was a child model,
he lost out on a national campaign

11:01.452 --> 11:05.289
for Heelys skate shoes,
and his mom blamed it on his ankles.

11:05.373 --> 11:10.294
Do you know how humiliating it was
to just walk places in 2004?

11:11.295 --> 11:12.672
Like a donkey.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.383
Next!

11:16.926 --> 11:21.013
Afternoon, Irma. That's a beautiful name.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.390
Can I help you?

11:22.473 --> 11:24.850
Not unless you have
a spare pair of tube socks.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.854
I'm just here for my mail.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.315
I like to pick it up here
instead of waiting for it.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.650
It's fresher that way.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.945
-Your name.
-Cody Briggs.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.781
Okay, what the hell is going on?
Who are you people?

11:38.864 --> 11:41.701
I'm just a boy
whose ankles are his Achilles heel.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.328
I got this.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.501
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.921
Grant's jaw framing.
This lady doesn't stand a chance.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.091
I'm having a rough day and…

11:58.008 --> 11:58.968
I'm so sad.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.636
Oh, no.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.140
It would really mean so much to me

12:04.223 --> 12:07.852
if you could give me any forwarding
address you have on file for Cody Briggs.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.480
I mean, obviously, I'm not supposed to.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.607
Just this once?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.861
Sure, why not?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.158
I put my number down too.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.118
In case you need it, or whatever.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.581
All right, start talking.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.958
Who sent you? What are you doing here?

12:31.041 --> 12:33.461
Are you from the government
or the shadow government?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.130
Uh, no, sir, we just--

12:36.213 --> 12:41.177
Um, we saw your gnome outside and it
reminded us of our grandmother's gnome,

12:41.260 --> 12:44.054
and so we wanted to get a closer look.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.140
We never should have trespassed
on your property.

12:46.223 --> 12:50.853
You're not from the CIA?
FBI? NSA? Facebook?

12:52.438 --> 12:55.524
Guess you do look a little puny
to Zero Dark Thirty me.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.570
Chelsea, his mail.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.615
Oh, you know what? I'm so sorry.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.992
May I use your restroom? Please.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.578
You're not gonna look through
my medicine cabinet, are you?

13:08.162 --> 13:11.874
All my prescriptions
are in generic MiraLAX bottles,

13:11.957 --> 13:14.043
so good luck finding anything.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.215
-Got it.
-It's down the hall and to the left.

13:26.639 --> 13:31.352
You have a beautiful home.

13:33.604 --> 13:37.983
I just love this medieval dungeon door.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.611
Very mid-16th century modern.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.489
It's my mother's room.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.615
Oh.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.538
It sounds like
you really love your mother,

13:50.621 --> 13:51.914
and I think that's really sweet.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.874
Thank you.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.043
She's a nightmare.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.212
Um… Hey.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.672
Hey.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.926
Did you ever own a Ferrari?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.929
Because I've always imagined you
as a Ferrari guy.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.681
Always imagined?

14:09.265 --> 14:13.143
Uh… Since we walked in.

14:14.562 --> 14:19.066
No, I mean, I used to go
into a Ferrari dealership sometimes,

14:19.149 --> 14:22.111
but that was just because they have
amazing air conditioning

14:22.194 --> 14:24.488
where I could cool down my bunions.

14:25.114 --> 14:29.285
Walking to your podiatrist's appointment
is a real lose-lose situation.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.539
Wow, that is a disappointing answer.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.586
Okay, I'm all done.
We should really be going.

14:38.669 --> 14:43.799
Okay, well, I apologize
if I was a little aggressive.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.551
I play a lot of Catan

14:45.634 --> 14:50.264
and it's made me into the hypervigilant
macho man you see before you.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.895
-Right. Well, goodbye, Cody Briggs.
-Claire!

14:56.770 --> 14:59.481
Is that my mail? How do you know my name?

14:59.565 --> 15:02.818
I knew I shouldn't have given
Cold Stone my real birthday.

15:04.778 --> 15:08.824
And to the troll
who came for my ankles, how dare you?

15:08.908 --> 15:12.119
Whoever you are,
these ankles have carried me,

15:12.202 --> 15:14.288
and it's been tough, y'all, like…

15:15.497 --> 15:19.043
My great-grandpa fought in
one of those really old wars. Ha, okay?

15:19.126 --> 15:22.338
So you don't even know the journey
that these ankles have walked,

15:22.421 --> 15:24.965
but I am strong, I am fearless.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.218
And I have a code for 10% off
CBB cheese if you swipe up.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.345
So swipe up!

15:31.472 --> 15:32.681
Jayden, focus.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.643
Let's grab Cody's mail,
bring it back to the house.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.771
It's cool what's become of my life.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.897
-Aw.
-Yeah, right?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.234
Good day, mate.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.779
Love that walking. Right, left, repeat.

15:46.862 --> 15:47.821
Awesome.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.908
And… applesauce.

15:50.991 --> 15:51.825
Huh?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.911
Applesauce. That's our code word for "go."

15:55.788 --> 15:57.456
Who did I talk to about this?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.124
Go, go, go.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.673
-It's empty.
-Stop right there!

16:05.756 --> 16:07.925
Oh, no, we're crackerjacks.

16:08.008 --> 16:08.926
What?

16:09.009 --> 16:10.177
That means we're busted.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.179
Who did I talk to about this?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.645
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

16:19.728 --> 16:21.605
-We're crackerjacks.
-Oh, it was you.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.733
-It was you.
-Oh, my God.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.694
-Claire, I've had the craziest day.
-Really?

16:26.777 --> 16:27.987
You know each other?

16:28.070 --> 16:30.239
What are you people doing on my property?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.449
Holding my gnome? And stealing my mail?

16:32.533 --> 16:34.952
-And asking me about Ferraris?
-Okay.

16:35.035 --> 16:35.953
Cody…

16:36.036 --> 16:37.496
…let me explain. Um…

16:38.288 --> 16:40.541
We all live in the house
that you used to live in.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.834
Yeah. 42 Alfalfa.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.795
Oh, I loved that house.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.297
Although there was always
a bit of a mouse problem.

16:49.008 --> 16:49.925
Go on.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.218
Um…

16:51.301 --> 16:55.681
Well, they all play this game
where they open up your junk mail,

16:55.764 --> 16:57.891
and it's just a fun, silly drinking game,

16:57.975 --> 17:01.437
but this time I, um-- I burnt the mail.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.022
You burnt it?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.816
-I thought I threw it away.
-No. I totally destroyed it.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.944
And that's why I wanted your mail.
I didn't want to ruin their fun.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.281
And, if I'm honest,
making friends hasn't always been easy.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.742
I don't care about your personal stories.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.786
Right, right,
I think it's best if we just…

17:17.870 --> 17:19.288
Applesauce.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.001
Wait, wait, wait!

17:27.212 --> 17:29.048
Catalina Snorkel Adventures.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.884
This couldn't be, um…

17:32.634 --> 17:34.011
Ramona Delgado?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.473
How did you know that?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.184
It's her? Really? Oh.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.019
Are you married? Do you have kids?

17:42.102 --> 17:44.063
Are you currently living
happily ever after?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.357
Does it look like a woman
who is not my mother lives here?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.862
No, it does not.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.282
Ramona and I were roommates,

17:56.033 --> 17:59.453
but to me she was so much more.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.206
-Cody, sweetie, come here.
-Huh?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.124
-Uh-huh.
-Come.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.751
Sit down.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.462
Tell us everything.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.214
Well…

18:11.215 --> 18:12.758
we were just friends.

18:13.258 --> 18:18.097
And then somewhere along the way,
I didn't plan for it to happen, but…

18:18.889 --> 18:20.099
I fell in love with her.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.436
Did you ever tell her how you felt?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.105
Well, I wanted to.

18:26.188 --> 18:29.650
That day we went snorkeling
in Catalina, but…

18:30.943 --> 18:32.319
I lost my nerve.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.907
And then, time passed, life happened.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.911
I maybe became a little bit of a shut-in.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.624
I doubt she even remembers me.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.335
Or… Or…

18:50.212 --> 18:52.756
Ramona has never forgotten you either

18:52.840 --> 18:57.136
and every time she sees a snorkel,
she thinks of you and smiles.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.888
-To Ramona.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.141
Which is why she moved to Hawaii,

19:02.224 --> 19:05.602
where she can snorkel every day
and keep you in her heart.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.062
To Ramona.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.940
By day, she leads dolphin tours
for the blind.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.485
And by night,
she watches the moon rise over the sea.

19:13.569 --> 19:17.990
And her heart warms
hoping that her long-lost lover Cody

19:18.073 --> 19:19.533
is still out there.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.368
To Ramona.

19:24.496 --> 19:28.083
And so Cody decided to…

19:29.751 --> 19:36.216
Cody decided to go find Ramona
to finally tell her how he feels?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.384
Yes!

19:37.467 --> 19:38.385
Yes!

19:38.468 --> 19:41.430
Really? What if she doesn't feel
the same way about me?

19:41.513 --> 19:44.766
Cody, if there's anything
I've learned from these people,

19:44.850 --> 19:48.562
it's that sometimes you just
have to close your eyes and go for it

19:48.645 --> 19:50.939
and hope that it all works out,
no matter what.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.861
Well, okay. I'll go.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.529
To Cody Briggs!

19:57.613 --> 19:59.364
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

19:59.448 --> 20:00.407
-Okay!
-Let's go.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.743
Yeah. I can legally officiate.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.120
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.206
You guys aren't coming.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.625
Also, I'm not just going to go tonight.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.002
I have to, like, plan it and everything.

20:14.129 --> 20:14.963
But…

20:16.924 --> 20:17.966
thank you.

20:19.509 --> 20:20.344
Come here.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.929
-Oh, oh.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.273
How about this for Cody Briggs' orchard?

20:33.357 --> 20:35.108
Ki-dew.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.652
Mmm.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.655
-That's delicious.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.450
Okay. What would go with a kumquat?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.701
Mm, watermelon.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.954
-Yes.
-Yeah.

20:47.037 --> 20:50.249
We can call it, Kumwater.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.838
Whoo!

20:56.922 --> 20:59.508
I gotta sober up. Anyone want a beer?

20:59.591 --> 21:02.386
Oh, yeah, I'd bove a leer. Oh, no.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.682
We've never had
a better Cody Briggs night, ever.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.394
I mean, we played
the Cody Briggs game with Cody Briggs.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.648
I was so worried
it was gonna be ruined for you.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.567
Why was it so important to you
that I play that game?

21:17.651 --> 21:21.321
You're one of my favorite people.
And I wanted you to have fun.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.658
That's really sweet.
You're always looking out for me.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.244
-I really appreciate that.
-Yeah, of course.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.163
Still can't believe
all that stuff about Ramona.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.499
Yeah, it's amazing.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.668
Sounds like he really fell for her.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.337
Yeah.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.758
Do you actually think
they'll end up together?

21:41.842 --> 21:43.635
Like really?

21:44.678 --> 21:45.679
I don't know.

21:46.763 --> 21:47.723
But I want them to.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.770
-Oh, my God!
-What? What is it?

21:54.479 --> 21:56.440
I just found out who my troll is.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.400
It's my mother.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.819
What?
