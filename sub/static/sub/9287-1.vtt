WEBVTT

00:05.393 --> 00:08.510
About time you got back.
Hot run - Cashmere and Swanson.

00:08.593 --> 00:11.665
Sector Four? I ain't goin'
all the way up there. It's raining.

00:11.753 --> 00:14.426
Is it raining in Seattle? Stop the presses.

00:15.873 --> 00:17.989
What do you think you're doin'?

00:18.073 --> 00:20.712
Boss told me to get a locker. This one's free.

00:20.793 --> 00:23.785
No, it ain't. Here, try one of these.

00:23.873 --> 00:26.148
Take that, too.

00:31.633 --> 00:35.308
Do not adjust your set.
This is a Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

00:35.393 --> 00:37.543
The cable hack will last 60 seconds.

00:37.633 --> 00:42.707
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped,
and it is the only free voice left in this city.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.829
Since the early 1990s,

00:44.913 --> 00:48.508
billions of tax dollars have been diverted
from government programmes

00:48.593 --> 00:51.232
to fund secret experiments
in genetic engineering.

00:51.313 --> 00:53.781
- Cool.
- Shut up, fool.

00:53.873 --> 00:57.263
This covert operation
is known as Project Manticore.

00:57.713 --> 01:00.386
Its goal: To create the perfect soldier,

01:00.473 --> 01:03.545
genetically enhanced
for superior strength and speed.

01:03.633 --> 01:07.387
These children are subjected to
relentless training and propaganda.

01:07.473 --> 01:12.149
In the winter of 2009, 12 of them escaped
from a facility in Gillette, Wyoming.

01:12.233 --> 01:15.191
Some of them were captured,
some of them were tortured,

01:15.273 --> 01:17.582
some gave their lives fighting to stay free.

01:17.673 --> 01:22.622
Since these cable hacks began, Manticore has
consolidated its activities to a secret location.

01:22.713 --> 01:24.510
Eyes Only will find it,

01:24.593 --> 01:28.029
and those responsible for these crimes
will be brought to justice.

01:28.113 --> 01:31.150
This has been
a Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

02:12.393 --> 02:15.590
- What's the matter, 452? Still recuperating?
- Bite me!

02:15.673 --> 02:18.267
Must have given you a lousy heart.

02:25.953 --> 02:27.784
452!

02:27.873 --> 02:29.864
Director wants to see you.

02:32.393 --> 02:34.384
State your designation.

02:35.393 --> 02:37.384
My name's Max!

02:41.713 --> 02:46.104
- State your designation.
- Kiss my transgenic ass!

02:50.913 --> 02:53.473
How long can an X5 last
without food or water?

02:53.553 --> 02:57.023
- Six days, maybe.
- Call me in a week.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.704
X5-452!

03:04.993 --> 03:09.908
You don't fool me. I know you're just
playing along. I wanna show you something.

03:15.033 --> 03:18.423
Your brother Zack. He's been so useful to us.

03:18.513 --> 03:21.346
His liver and kidneys
went to an X5 wounded on a mission.

03:21.433 --> 03:25.267
His heart - of course, as you know -
went to you.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.622
X5-599, I've got a heart for you.

03:33.433 --> 03:36.823
Here's your chance to say goodbye.
He's going to another facility.

03:36.913 --> 03:39.666
We have some very interesting plans for him.

03:41.073 --> 03:44.953
One thing that is for certain though
is that you are the reason he is there.

03:44.953 --> 03:46.671
One thing that is for certain though
is that you are the reason he is there.

03:47.953 --> 03:50.183
Don't you see, 452?

03:50.913 --> 03:54.986
You're poison.
You destroy everyone that you love.

03:55.073 --> 03:57.667
Zack, your brother Ben,

03:59.913 --> 04:02.268
your sister Tinga

04:02.353 --> 04:04.867
and him -

04:04.953 --> 04:06.944
Eyes Only.

04:07.033 --> 04:10.628
Now, I know that you've had
some kind of relationship with him.

04:10.713 --> 04:16.071
And I know that you're hanging on to the idea
you'll see him again, but that won't happen.

04:16.153 --> 04:20.942
He thinks you're dead, which is why
he's causing so much trouble for us.

04:21.473 --> 04:24.704
- So we're gonna find him.
- You'll never find him.

04:26.673 --> 04:28.823
And we're gonna kill him.

04:28.913 --> 04:30.949
You'll have nothing left.

04:32.713 --> 04:34.908
And then, 452,

04:35.993 --> 04:38.063
you will be mine.

04:43.353 --> 04:45.548
Lights out.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.224
Lights out, 452.

05:23.913 --> 05:26.825
Max. My name's Max.

05:28.073 --> 05:32.783
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.864
Then she escaped.

05:34.953 --> 05:39.265
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:39.353 --> 05:41.742
she is haunted by her past.

05:41.833 --> 05:46.193
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:46.193 --> 05:47.023
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.630
No loitering. Move along.

06:35.113 --> 06:38.230
What can I tell you? You're not in the system.

06:39.153 --> 06:42.190
I did my rehab at a VA in Gillette, Wyoming.

06:42.273 --> 06:44.582
I was in Serbia in '07.

06:44.673 --> 06:47.107
How do you think I ended up in this chair?

06:48.753 --> 06:50.744
- There's nothing here.
- Impossible.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.301
Impossible?
What, you never heard of the Pulse?

06:53.393 --> 06:57.989
That little nuclear airburst that fried all
the satellites and crashed all the computers?

06:58.073 --> 07:03.591
And sent the economy into a tailspin. It's why
we need our VA ration cards so we can eat.

07:03.673 --> 07:08.747
- What do you want me to do?
- Find the piece of paper with my name on it.

07:08.833 --> 07:12.462
Look, you want your ration card, it's simple.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.101
I'll put you in the system. That easy.

07:18.713 --> 07:22.831
All right, people, we're the S1W.
We're here to set this thing straight.

07:24.553 --> 07:27.909
Nobody is gonna get hurt
or pay for what they already have coming.

07:27.993 --> 07:31.622
And nobody is gonna leave here
without their ration cards.

07:34.073 --> 07:36.064
Get down!

07:39.313 --> 07:41.304
Gather round.

07:43.353 --> 07:46.345
Thought you'd get in the file room
pretending to be a vet?

07:46.433 --> 07:48.742
- I took a shot.
- So did I.

07:49.873 --> 07:54.424
- I appreciate you guys coming along.
- You got what you needed. We made a point.

07:54.513 --> 07:58.222
Those clowns are gonna think twice
before they shake people down again.

07:58.313 --> 08:02.226
This is Manticore's Wyoming facility.
Requisitions don't add up otherwise.

08:02.313 --> 08:06.829
Think they're running their budget through
the VA's books, trying to cover their tracks?

08:06.913 --> 08:09.950
If I can follow the money,
maybe I can find the main facility.

08:10.033 --> 08:15.153
Logan, how many jobs do you think we've
done for Eyes Only the past couple of years?

08:15.233 --> 08:17.224
I don't know. Why?

08:17.313 --> 08:21.625
I've just never seen you get
so caught up in an assignment before.

08:21.713 --> 08:26.503
It's not an assignment. Eyes Only
is taking on Manticore as a favour to me.

08:26.593 --> 08:31.064
- You're messing with some powerful people.
- I don't care what happens to me.

08:32.033 --> 08:35.150
It said in his hack
some of those kids escaped back in '09.

08:35.232 --> 08:37.667
You knew one of 'em, didn't you?

08:38.753 --> 08:41.221
Her name was Max.

08:42.553 --> 08:44.544
They killed her, didn't they?

08:44.633 --> 08:46.942
I watched her die.

08:48.753 --> 08:52.189
The thing is I can't really believe she's gone.

08:52.273 --> 08:54.264
I don't believe it.

08:56.033 --> 09:00.788
And I know it sounds crazy,
but I feel like... she's still out there.

09:02.033 --> 09:06.072
Those boots look like
they got shined with a bag of mud!

09:06.153 --> 09:11.227
Don't you have any respect for yourself?
For the unit that you represent?

09:11.313 --> 09:12.905
Take 'em to isolation.

09:16.793 --> 09:17.782
Eyes front!

09:17.913 --> 09:19.904
Eyes front!

09:37.913 --> 09:39.551
Lucky we hooked up.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.828
Happy anniversary.

09:41.913 --> 09:43.141
Just come back.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.784
Max.

10:24.073 --> 10:26.303
- Ben?
- What?

10:27.473 --> 10:30.510
You look like someone I used to know.

10:30.593 --> 10:32.424
My designation's 494.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.425
His was 493. You must be twinned.

10:37.233 --> 10:41.431
- 493? Your fellow traitor. Went psycho.
- What do you know about it?

10:41.513 --> 10:46.348
Cos of him I spent six months in Psy-Ops.
They wanted to make sure it wasn't genetic.

10:46.433 --> 10:49.823
- Ten years in the world finally got to him.
- This place got to him.

10:50.313 --> 10:54.306
- Whatever. Well, let's get this over with.
- What are you doing?

10:54.393 --> 10:56.953
We've been paired off.
I'm your breeding partner.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.625
My what?

10:58.713 --> 11:01.511
We're to copulate every night
until you get pregnant.

11:01.593 --> 11:03.311
- That's sick.
- It's your fault.

11:03.393 --> 11:08.547
If you hadn't blown up the DNA database,
they'd still be putting embryos in surrogates.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.908
- Take off your clothes.
- Get out.

11:10.993 --> 11:12.585
We've got our orders.

11:14.833 --> 11:19.349
- What the hell was that?
- The only physical contact we're gonna have.

11:19.433 --> 11:22.789
This isn't exactly a plum assignment
for me either.

11:22.873 --> 11:26.866
You spent half your life out there in filth.
I could catch something.

11:26.953 --> 11:31.743
Whatever you need to tell yourself,
just so long as we understand each other.

11:34.073 --> 11:36.587
Fine. Don't freak out on me.

11:39.353 --> 11:42.709
I took Common Verbal Usage
when I got cleared for my solo missions.

11:42.793 --> 11:45.432
- You mean assassinations?
- It was my job.

11:45.513 --> 11:48.232
You gonna bust my chops about it, go ahead.

11:48.313 --> 11:51.589
He's reading love poetry, you know,
to get me in the mood.

11:51.673 --> 11:53.664
You got something for me?

11:54.513 --> 11:56.310
Beautiful.

11:57.913 --> 12:02.225
Do me a favour. Give these to Vic.
Tell him he can pay me later.

12:02.313 --> 12:04.304
- No problem.
- Thanks.

12:05.233 --> 12:08.111
He likes those vitamins
they make us pop every morning.

12:08.193 --> 12:12.664
- I'm not even gonna ask about the cigars.
- I got a few things workin'.

12:12.753 --> 12:17.747
Listen, I got an hour to kill before I head
back to the barracks. Wake me up at 0100.

12:27.633 --> 12:30.750
- Lydecker.
- Deck, this is McGinnis.

12:30.833 --> 12:34.621
- You're a hard man to track down.
- I try to avoid people looking to kill me.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.864
I have a proposition for you
from the committee.

12:39.153 --> 12:41.621
- Go ahead.
- They want Eyes Only.

12:41.713 --> 12:45.991
- We need you to set the meet.
- Look, we both know what that means.

12:46.073 --> 12:49.353
You do this and
they'll bring you in from the cold.

12:52.353 --> 12:54.344
Since you put it that way.

12:56.393 --> 13:00.306
- Report.
- Successful copulation with X5-392, ma'am.

13:00.393 --> 13:02.190
Excellent.

13:04.193 --> 13:07.151
- Report.
- Copulation was unsuccessful, ma'am.

13:07.793 --> 13:10.148
- Explain.
- X5-698 failed to achieve

13:10.233 --> 13:12.667
minimum mission requirements, ma'am.

13:18.393 --> 13:20.190
Report.

13:24.993 --> 13:28.224
Successful copulation
between myself and X5-452, ma'am.

13:30.153 --> 13:32.189
Twice.

13:32.273 --> 13:34.264
Excellent, 452.

13:35.313 --> 13:37.952
What would your boyfriend say?

13:38.033 --> 13:42.902
Tell me, did you receive any medical
treatment when you were on the outside?

13:42.993 --> 13:44.585
No, ma'am.

13:44.673 --> 13:46.664
Then how do you explain this?

13:47.513 --> 13:51.586
She's a younger version of you,
but she's suffering from late-stage progeria.

13:55.793 --> 14:01.026
Except for her X7-specific code sequences,
her DNA is identical to yours.

14:01.113 --> 14:03.707
So I'm gonna ask you again.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.990
Did you receive any medical care
that we should know about?

14:07.433 --> 14:09.025
No, ma'am.

14:09.113 --> 14:13.470
I guess we're just gonna have to do spinals
on you both, so we can run a DNA analysis.

14:13.553 --> 14:19.264
Or maybe you've just been lucky. For
all we know, that could still happen to you.

15:17.113 --> 15:18.512
Easy, easy.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.743
Easy.

15:21.313 --> 15:23.304
Relax, big fella.

15:25.593 --> 15:27.663
You relax, little fella.

15:28.073 --> 15:30.223
Wow. You can talk.

15:32.233 --> 15:37.705
I didn't mean anything by it. I've just never
seen anyone that looks like you before.

15:37.793 --> 15:42.230
So what happened? They throw
too much canine DNA in your cocktail?

15:44.033 --> 15:47.150
Cat. Cat in your cocktail.

15:47.753 --> 15:49.744
Don't hold it against me.

15:51.473 --> 15:53.907
I dig your teeth. Can I see 'em?

15:57.353 --> 15:59.503
Come on. Let me see.

16:00.753 --> 16:02.948
It's OK. It's all right.

16:06.473 --> 16:08.464
Those are cool.

16:10.073 --> 16:12.906
- You're X5.
- Yeah. You can call me Max.

16:15.793 --> 16:18.865
Max... Max... Max.

16:18.953 --> 16:22.548
- Father named you?
- No. No father. Just me.

16:24.033 --> 16:26.593
Father named me.

16:26.673 --> 16:29.983
- Joshua.
- Father? You don't mean Lydecker?

16:31.273 --> 16:32.865
No.

16:34.113 --> 16:36.673
Father - Sandeman.

16:38.713 --> 16:40.908
Sandeman named you.

16:40.993 --> 16:42.984
OK.

16:44.273 --> 16:46.548
Guard! Guard.

16:50.753 --> 16:53.790
- So they don't know you're down here?
- No.

16:53.873 --> 16:56.671
What about this Sandeman father of yours?

16:57.513 --> 17:00.710
Left me here. Here I am.

17:00.793 --> 17:04.229
- He just left you here?
- Made me, then left me.

17:05.153 --> 17:07.508
True enough.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.584
That's pretty wack.

17:10.593 --> 17:12.628
He made us all.

17:12.713 --> 17:15.625
I was first. Special.

17:16.673 --> 17:18.664
Then more like me. More like you.

17:18.752 --> 17:22.507
More people. Up there, people.

17:22.913 --> 17:25.301
Father lost in all the people.

17:25.393 --> 17:27.906
But I'm here, waiting.

17:31.433 --> 17:34.345
It's too bad you don't have
a room with a view.

17:34.433 --> 17:38.062
A window. I'm trying to
find a way outta here.

17:38.153 --> 17:39.950
Wait.

17:58.433 --> 18:01.231
Looks like this father of yours
kept himself real busy.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.666
Some like me. Some not so good.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.782
- Hungry.
- Well, maybe someone oughta feed 'em.

18:12.833 --> 18:16.269
They do sometimes.

18:17.273 --> 18:19.468
I do sometimes.

18:23.913 --> 18:26.507
Room with a view.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.783
This is gonna take a while.

18:36.873 --> 18:40.866
- OK with you if I slap an exit sign on this?
- No exit.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.262
- X7s in the forest.
- How many?

18:43.353 --> 18:45.071
One.

18:45.153 --> 18:47.030
Yup. There he is.

18:47.113 --> 18:49.183
I think I can take him on.

18:49.273 --> 18:52.504
- Come on, there's only one.
- Lots of one.

18:55.713 --> 18:57.544
I get it.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.424
Lots of one.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.824
Pretty wack.

19:04.913 --> 19:05.633
What are they doing?

19:05.633 --> 19:06.907
What are they doing?

19:11.673 --> 19:14.346
- Talking.
- But I don't hear anything.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.503
I do.

19:16.593 --> 19:21.428
- Must be up in the ultrasonic range.
- Bat. Bat in their cocktail.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.824
Sun'll be up soon.

19:32.073 --> 19:35.429
I gotta blaze. Be back tomorrow, though.

19:35.513 --> 19:37.504
Thanks for everything, Joshua.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.191
You blaze.

19:48.033 --> 19:50.024
No. I wanna do it now.

19:50.473 --> 19:52.464
Yeah, right now.

19:54.233 --> 19:56.224
OK. I'll meet you there.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.108
- Hey.
- Hi. What's up?

20:04.193 --> 20:08.584
- Going to Sector Three. Can I stash this here?
- Sure. What is it?

20:08.673 --> 20:12.825
It's something I don't want the police to see
when I go through checkpoint.

20:12.913 --> 20:15.143
It's a box of guns.

20:15.233 --> 20:18.430
Right. Look, I've gotta
meet someone, so let yourself out.

20:18.513 --> 20:21.710
OK. I promise they'll be gone
by tomorrow night.

20:34.113 --> 20:37.549
- You said you had some information for me?
- I did.

20:37.953 --> 20:41.946
- I'm trying to find Manticore.
- Looks like Manticore found you.

20:45.833 --> 20:51.510
- Sorry, son.
- So, this is the Great and Powerful Oz.

20:51.593 --> 20:53.584
Hold on. Let me get a good look.

20:53.673 --> 20:55.265
I wouldn't do that, Jim.

20:56.193 --> 20:58.024
Duck!

21:04.673 --> 21:07.392
- You all right?
- You shot me!

21:07.473 --> 21:10.146
I told you to duck. It just winged you.

21:10.233 --> 21:14.545
- We had a deal.
- Renfro. What's she doin' to the X5s?

21:14.633 --> 21:16.544
I don't know.

21:17.873 --> 21:20.068
She murdered one of my kids.

21:20.873 --> 21:22.750
That bitch murdered one of my kids!

21:25.033 --> 21:27.593
All right. All right, Deck.

21:31.113 --> 21:34.503
Now, don't play stupid,
or I'll take your other eye.

21:36.033 --> 21:39.992
All right. The tank is
some kind of extraction chamber.

21:40.073 --> 21:42.906
She was trying to find out
something in the girl's DNA.

21:42.993 --> 21:44.790
- What?
- I don't know.

21:44.873 --> 21:48.309
Whatever she wanted, she wanted it bad,
but it wasn't there.

21:49.633 --> 21:52.101
Damn, Deck. I'm gonna need some stitches.

21:52.793 --> 21:55.182
Could you please take me
to the hospital now?

21:55.273 --> 21:58.151
There's a problem, Jim.
You got a good look at my friend.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.669
No, no, I didn't.
I hardly laid an eye on the guy.

22:01.753 --> 22:03.983
My depth perception's all shot anyway.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.952
Besides, all you white boys look alike to me.

22:09.833 --> 22:12.631
Come on, Deck. We're old friends.

22:14.353 --> 22:16.469
What do you think?

22:20.633 --> 22:23.227
We never really liked each other, did we?

22:24.953 --> 22:27.148
So you wanna know about Manticore?

22:35.233 --> 22:38.066
Another night or two and we'll be in business.

22:43.353 --> 22:45.344
Max.

22:46.513 --> 22:49.744
- Outside?
- Max outside. That's the plan.

22:49.833 --> 22:52.267
Joshua outside.

22:52.353 --> 22:54.708
That's the plan.

22:54.793 --> 22:56.784
You wanna come with me?

22:58.513 --> 23:01.107
- I don't know.
- I know.

23:01.193 --> 23:04.105
Max and Joshua outside.

23:05.593 --> 23:10.269
The thing is,
there's nobody like you in the world.

23:10.833 --> 23:16.393
You know, people get scared real easy
about things that are different.

23:16.393 --> 23:16.666
You know, people get scared real easy
about things that are different.

23:19.953 --> 23:25.903
I'm just saying that you'll be trading
one basement for another. That's all.

23:43.753 --> 23:46.142
Forget we had a date?

23:57.153 --> 23:59.383
So when do the storm troopers bust in?

24:00.633 --> 24:03.591
Don't worry. I didn't send up the alarm.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.664
Not yet.

24:06.393 --> 24:09.703
- What do you want?
- I'm not lookin' for trouble.

24:09.793 --> 24:11.784
What you do is your own business.

24:14.033 --> 24:17.821
Why do you want out of here?
You got a roof over your head, plenty to eat,

24:17.913 --> 24:19.710
which is more than most people.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.706
Think Manticore takes care of you
out of the goodness of its heart?

24:23.793 --> 24:26.466
- It's using you.
- Nobody's using me.

24:27.353 --> 24:30.948
That's what you don't get.
You're working for the bad guys.

24:32.793 --> 24:36.752
I'm gonna be out of here in five minutes,
go back to my cell.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.983
And you'll get rid of me. OK, 452?

24:39.073 --> 24:41.587
- My name's Max.
- Whatever you say.

24:41.673 --> 24:45.188
- You should have a name, too.
- I told you. My designation's 494.

24:45.273 --> 24:47.423
It doesn't suit you.

24:48.433 --> 24:50.993
- I'm gonna call you Alec.
- Alec?

24:51.073 --> 24:53.792
As in smart aleck.

24:53.873 --> 24:57.707
- I can live with that.
- Good. Cos my second choice was Dick.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.590
Guard.

25:05.873 --> 25:09.070
See you around, Max.

25:16.273 --> 25:19.583
- Lydecker double-crossed us.
- He knows our location.

25:19.673 --> 25:22.949
If Eyes Only broadcasts it,
the committee will bury us.

25:23.033 --> 25:25.024
Sir, over here.

25:27.353 --> 25:29.742
- What is it?
- Blood trail.

25:30.553 --> 25:33.147
Couldn't have been one of ours.
None survived.

25:33.233 --> 25:36.828
Take a sample and run a full DNA assay.
And get back here right away.

25:39.553 --> 25:42.670
You don't understand
what's at stake here, 452.

25:42.753 --> 25:48.589
If Eyes Only isn't stopped, there are gonna be
news vans parked outside the perimeter.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.746
Committee is not gonna allow the existence
of this programme to be exposed.

25:52.833 --> 25:55.666
It'll jeopardise its other operations.

25:55.753 --> 25:58.062
Guess I'm supposed to ask what that means.

25:58.153 --> 26:02.226
It means that I lock down the cells
and I burn this place to the ground,

26:02.313 --> 26:04.873
with you and everyone else inside.

26:04.953 --> 26:08.423
What, you don't believe me?
On paper this place is a VA hospital.

26:08.513 --> 26:13.906
Anybody comes looking, all they'll find is
the remains of a fire that killed all its patients.

26:13.993 --> 26:18.305
- It's called plausible deniability.
- It's called bluffing.

26:18.393 --> 26:20.953
Look, you need to understand something.

26:21.033 --> 26:24.150
You are nothing but meat to me.

26:24.233 --> 26:26.030
This...

26:26.913 --> 26:29.666
This is what matters.

26:29.753 --> 26:35.350
I can start over anywhere. I just put all the
data we have accumulated into my briefcase,

26:35.433 --> 26:41.065
lock the door, light the match
and kiss your transgenic ass goodbye.

26:43.473 --> 26:47.864
You make me find Eyes Only by myself,
he is a dead man.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.264
Help me,

26:51.313 --> 26:54.305
there's a deal to be made. Think about it.

26:58.313 --> 27:01.589
We ran the blood sample
we found at the warehouse.

27:01.673 --> 27:03.584
Time's up.

27:16.713 --> 27:20.501
You're going to help me
whether you want to or not.

27:40.073 --> 27:42.064
You OK?

27:42.753 --> 27:46.143
- Finally got it out of you.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

27:46.233 --> 27:50.511
I heard they were sending an X5
to take out some reporter friend of yours.

27:51.513 --> 27:54.585
- I didn't tell them anything.
- Are you sure?

27:56.473 --> 27:58.270
I gotta get outta here now.

27:58.353 --> 28:04.144
You're in no shape to tangle with those X7s.
If you're lucky, they'll take you alive.

28:04.233 --> 28:07.543
- Then help me.
- I told you. I'm not lookin' for trouble.

28:07.633 --> 28:10.431
This is your chance
to get me out of your life for good.

28:10.513 --> 28:14.984
- If you escape, I'll get a new breeding partner.
- Now we're talking.

28:19.713 --> 28:23.911
Makes you wonder what else is down here.
Did you get a look at this thing?

28:23.993 --> 28:26.302
He's not a thing. His name's Joshua.

28:26.393 --> 28:30.022
X7s in the forest. Pretty wack.

28:30.113 --> 28:32.104
Yeah, Sasquatch.

28:34.393 --> 28:38.386
Why don't you make yourself useful
and come and help us out with these bars?

28:38.473 --> 28:40.509
OK.

28:57.673 --> 29:00.710
All right. Everybody knows what to do?

29:13.593 --> 29:15.584
He's gettin' away.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.664
Come on.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.384
Sorry, kid.

29:33.273 --> 29:36.185
Maybe I should just let you guys handle this.

29:41.193 --> 29:43.627
Whoa, boys.

29:45.313 --> 29:47.304
No need for firepower, fellas.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.948
Just tryin' to help.

30:14.593 --> 30:17.027
You blaze.

30:21.353 --> 30:25.232
Do not adjust your set.
This is a Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

30:25.313 --> 30:27.622
Your location has been revealed.

30:50.233 --> 30:52.508
Max.

30:52.593 --> 30:54.424
We gotta get you outta here.

30:54.513 --> 30:56.504
They're coming to get you.

31:04.753 --> 31:06.744
We gotta go. They're coming to get you.

31:06.833 --> 31:10.462
- Who's coming? How did you...
- I'll explain later. Come on.

31:10.553 --> 31:14.102
- No, I have to finish my broadcast.
- Forget it. It's not important.

31:14.553 --> 31:16.544
What's wrong?

31:17.353 --> 31:20.789
- I don't know.
- Logan, what's happening?

31:20.873 --> 31:21.513
You killed him. That's what's happening.
Nice job, 452. Mission accomplished.

31:21.513 --> 31:25.984
You killed him. That's what's happening.
Nice job, 452. Mission accomplished.

31:31.873 --> 31:34.546
Stop touching him.
You're just gonna make it worse.

31:34.633 --> 31:38.103
- What are you talking about?
- A genetically targeted retrovirus.

31:38.193 --> 31:39.785
You're the carrier.

31:39.873 --> 31:44.708
Any intimate contact between you activates
the agent. You didn't kiss him, did you?

31:44.793 --> 31:48.502
- You son of a bitch!
- Whoa. I'm just followin' orders.

31:48.873 --> 31:52.548
Renfro said if you want him to live,
bring him back to Manticore.

31:52.633 --> 31:55.352
- There's a cure?
- Yeah. She'll give him the antigen

31:55.433 --> 31:57.389
if he tells her who he works with.

31:57.713 --> 32:00.910
- Why should I believe her?
- What choice do you have?

32:03.793 --> 32:06.751
Results of the DNA workup
you ordered on 452.

32:06.833 --> 32:10.382
Did you find anything
to explain why there's no progeria?

32:10.473 --> 32:12.464
Maybe you better take a look.

32:17.953 --> 32:22.583
I've never seen anything like it. To be sure,
I'll run another series when 494 gets her back.

32:22.673 --> 32:25.873
- Does anyone else know about this?
- No, ma'am.

32:26.713 --> 32:28.704
Let's keep it that way.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.661
Looks like we got ourselves a convoy.

33:39.513 --> 33:41.310
Logan!

33:46.873 --> 33:49.068
Fine. But when he's dead, can I go home?

33:51.273 --> 33:53.503
It's not gonna be there.

33:54.713 --> 33:58.228
- What are you doing?
- Ending this thing once and for all.

34:04.073 --> 34:07.748
Do not adjust your set.
This is a Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

34:07.953 --> 34:10.420
Your location has been revealed.

34:10.513 --> 34:13.983
Your secret is out. Manticore
will be held accountable for its crimes.

34:14.072 --> 34:15.062
It's them.

34:15.152 --> 34:19.543
Manticore's facility is
an hour southwest of Seattle.

34:20.753 --> 34:22.744
Understood.

34:23.672 --> 34:26.824
Lock down the barracks.
We're cauterising the site.

34:47.033 --> 34:48.625
Don't move.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.704
Put it on the floor.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.302
Fine. Have it your way.
I was just gonna put him out of his misery.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.224
Nice piece.

35:51.513 --> 35:53.708
We've got a security breach.

35:54.473 --> 35:56.862
Someone's unlocking the cell doors.

36:02.473 --> 36:05.590
Well, override the system.
Lock down those doors.

36:05.673 --> 36:08.346
Can't. Control conduits must be burned out.

36:11.473 --> 36:15.466
- They're heading for the fence.
- Stop them. No one gets past the perimeters.

36:15.553 --> 36:18.147
Bring me 452 alive!

36:31.873 --> 36:33.465
Move! Move!

36:33.553 --> 36:36.704
Go! Free! Free!

36:49.353 --> 36:52.663
Security personnel, secure the perimeter!

37:10.033 --> 37:12.103
- We need to evacuate.
- Where's 452?

37:12.193 --> 37:14.866
- Now, ma'am!
- I'm not leaving without her.

37:14.953 --> 37:17.706
What a coincidence,
cos I'm not leaving without you.

37:23.593 --> 37:27.472
- Where's the antigen?
- I don't know. We gotta get out now, 452.

37:29.273 --> 37:29.433
My name's Max! Now, where is it?

37:29.433 --> 37:32.106
My name's Max! Now, where is it?

37:32.193 --> 37:34.184
OK. OK.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.181
No!

37:48.113 --> 37:50.104
I won't tell if you don't.

37:57.713 --> 38:00.147
This virus you put in me.
How do I get rid of it?

38:00.233 --> 38:02.542
You can't.

38:02.633 --> 38:05.022
You just ate a bullet for me. Why?

38:06.233 --> 38:07.712
You...

38:10.833 --> 38:13.222
You are the one we've been looking for.

38:16.113 --> 38:18.104
Sandeman...

38:18.513 --> 38:20.185
Father - Sandeman.

38:21.113 --> 38:24.901
Find Sandeman.

39:15.593 --> 39:17.743
He's gonna be all right.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.824
Welcome back.

39:24.113 --> 39:26.991
You don't have to stand
all the way over there.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.870
Come closer.

39:32.633 --> 39:34.544
Better not risk it.

39:34.633 --> 39:39.309
We don't know how easily I can reinfect you,
and that was the last of the antigen.

39:40.473 --> 39:43.067
We're gonna find a way to beat this.

39:44.113 --> 39:46.069
Yeah.

39:46.153 --> 39:49.145
But you should concentrate on getting better.

39:51.793 --> 39:54.353
- I gotta go.
- Things are different now.

39:54.433 --> 39:59.427
Back when you first got out, it was
just the 12 of you. Now there's a lot more.

40:01.513 --> 40:03.549
They're smart. They'll lay low.

40:03.633 --> 40:07.228
You don't want it getting around
that you and yours are out in the world.

40:07.313 --> 40:10.430
People tend to get scared
of things that are different.

40:12.393 --> 40:14.429
