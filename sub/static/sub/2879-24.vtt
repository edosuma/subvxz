WEBVTT

00:02.144 --> 00:04.945
So, anyway, last night on
video chat, I spent, like,

00:04.947 --> 00:07.381
20 minutes just staring
into Lucy's eyes.

00:07.383 --> 00:08.883
Oh, that sounds romantic.

00:08.885 --> 00:11.219
It was until I realized
the screen had frozen.

00:12.604 --> 00:15.122
Still one of my top three dates
of all time.

00:15.124 --> 00:17.475
So, are we ever gonna
hang out with this girl?

00:17.477 --> 00:18.843
I'd love that,

00:18.845 --> 00:20.845
but she's not really comfortable
around people.

00:20.847 --> 00:24.015
Yeah, I used to be
uncomfortable around people,

00:24.017 --> 00:25.733
but then I learned a trick.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.318
I pretend everyone I meet

00:27.320 --> 00:30.304
is a beloved character
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

00:31.323 --> 00:32.774
How's that been working
for you?

00:32.776 --> 00:36.277
Oh, like a charm, unnamed
crewman in a red shirt.

00:36.279 --> 00:40.531
Leonard, I may have
gotten you a job.

00:40.533 --> 00:41.949
I have a job.

00:41.951 --> 00:42.950
Yes, he does.

00:42.952 --> 00:45.319
He caters to
my every whim.

00:45.321 --> 00:48.656
No, in a couple of weeks,
Stephen Hawking's team

00:48.658 --> 00:50.825
is sending an expedition
to the North Sea

00:50.827 --> 00:53.461
to test hydrodynamic
simulations of black holes.

00:53.463 --> 00:55.780
One of their experimental
physicists dropped out,

00:55.782 --> 00:57.665
and I recommended you.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.468
Well, do you really think
I have a shot?

01:00.470 --> 01:02.436
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking.
I talked you up.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.188
He knows your research.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.388
I think this could happen.

01:05.391 --> 01:07.508
He knows-- Wow!

01:07.510 --> 01:11.178
Well, now, but do you
think that's a good idea?

01:11.947 --> 01:13.981
Uh, you know <i>Star Trek.</i>

01:13.983 --> 01:15.516
Should a guy
with no name

01:15.518 --> 01:18.119
and a red shirt really
go on an expedition?

01:19.454 --> 01:20.855
Hey, don't discourage him.

01:20.857 --> 01:22.490
This is a fantastic opportunity.

01:22.492 --> 01:23.825
No one asked you, Uhura.

01:28.547 --> 01:32.383
Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?

01:32.385 --> 01:34.468
What do you think?
Great.

01:36.204 --> 01:39.223
I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.

01:39.225 --> 01:41.726
Did you know
that the highest number

01:41.728 --> 01:47.047
of drowning accidents happen
on or around boats?

01:47.049 --> 01:49.517
Interesting that you would
bring that up

01:49.519 --> 01:51.435
when I might go work on a boat.

01:51.437 --> 01:53.220
Well, that's the thing
about factoids--

01:53.222 --> 01:54.739
they're interesting.

01:56.558 --> 01:58.609
I know what
you're doing.

01:58.611 --> 02:00.745
You don't want me going
on this research trip

02:00.747 --> 02:02.496
because you're afraid
to be alone.

02:02.498 --> 02:04.699
I'm not afraid to be alone.

02:04.701 --> 02:06.284
On land.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.237
On the sea,
it would be terrifying.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.625
Because of all the drowning.

02:14.627 --> 02:16.627
Sheldon.

02:16.629 --> 02:18.629
Fine, no more drowning talk.

02:18.631 --> 02:20.548
I'll change the subject.

02:20.550 --> 02:24.418
Oh. Who do you think
would win in a fight--

02:24.420 --> 02:27.772
you or a shark?

02:27.774 --> 02:30.808
Look, I appreciate
your signature blend

02:30.810 --> 02:33.861
of concern for me
and incredible selfishness.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.397
If I get the chance to do this,

02:36.399 --> 02:38.699
there is nothing you can say
that's going to stop me.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.534
Very well.

02:42.371 --> 02:45.373
Things between you and Penny
have never been better.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.209
I hope four months apart
doesn't change anything.

02:53.649 --> 02:56.667
I should have opened

03:25.564 --> 03:27.698
If you look
carefully at Venus,

03:27.700 --> 03:29.150
you should be
able to see

03:29.152 --> 03:31.869
the International
Space Station pass by.

03:31.871 --> 03:33.538
Wow.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.073
Your friend
was actually up there?

03:35.075 --> 03:37.341
Yeah. He brought me back
a T-shirt that said,

03:37.343 --> 03:39.243
"My Friend Went to
the Space Station

03:39.245 --> 03:41.579
and All I Got Was
This Lousy T-Shirt""

03:42.864 --> 03:44.882
Did he take the
T-shirt to space?

03:44.884 --> 03:47.769
Nope. It's exactly
as lousy as advertised.

03:48.637 --> 03:50.705
Speaking of friends,

03:50.707 --> 03:52.807
they have been
asking to meet you.

03:52.809 --> 03:54.475
I was thinking

03:54.477 --> 03:56.043
maybe we could all
hang out sometime?

03:56.045 --> 03:57.478
I don't know.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.763
How many are there?

03:58.765 --> 04:00.715
Let's see. Six.

04:00.717 --> 04:03.901
That's pretty cool;
I have six friends!

04:04.903 --> 04:07.188
Kind of like Sinatra.

04:08.723 --> 04:10.741
Six strangers?

04:10.743 --> 04:12.727
That's a lot of pressure.

04:12.729 --> 04:14.745
Staring at me,
asking me personal questions.

04:14.747 --> 04:16.914
Like, "What do you do""

04:16.916 --> 04:18.533
"Where are you from?"

04:18.535 --> 04:21.786
"Why did you lock yourself
in the bathroom?"

04:21.788 --> 04:24.905
Okay, how about
you just dip your toe in

04:24.907 --> 04:26.340
and meet one of them?

04:26.342 --> 04:29.093
Will you be there?

04:29.095 --> 04:30.261
Of course.

04:30.263 --> 04:32.246
Well, that's two.
Three if you count me.

04:32.248 --> 04:33.914
Oh, this is getting out of hand.

04:36.468 --> 04:38.669
So, then, during
my afternoon shift,

04:38.671 --> 04:41.189
I spilled an entire tray
of drinks on myself.

04:41.191 --> 04:42.773
Oh, that's awful.

04:42.775 --> 04:44.275
Not really.
My shirt was soaking wet.

04:44.277 --> 04:46.761
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
Oh.

04:48.530 --> 04:51.616
So, listen, do you remember
when I said

04:51.618 --> 04:53.401
the similarities
of the equations

04:53.403 --> 04:55.870
of general relativity
and hydrodynamics suggest

04:55.872 --> 04:58.439
you could find the equivalent
of Unruh radiation

04:58.441 --> 05:00.024
in a large body of water?

05:00.026 --> 05:02.109
I thought I said that to you.

05:05.998 --> 05:07.965
Anyway,

05:07.967 --> 05:10.418
Stephen Hawking's team
is looking into that,

05:10.420 --> 05:12.720
and I've been invited
to join them.

05:12.722 --> 05:14.155
Wow, Hawking!

05:14.157 --> 05:15.389
Good for you!

05:15.391 --> 05:16.457
Well, it is.

05:16.459 --> 05:18.676
Just-- you know,
I'd be gone for a while.

05:18.678 --> 05:19.760
Well, how long?

05:19.762 --> 05:20.961
Three, four months.

05:20.963 --> 05:22.480
Whoa.

05:22.482 --> 05:24.482
When would you leave?

05:24.484 --> 05:25.483
Couple weeks.

05:25.485 --> 05:27.251
Wow.

05:27.253 --> 05:29.103
O-Okay, well,
I'll just come visit you.

05:29.105 --> 05:31.189
That's the thing-- you can't.

05:31.191 --> 05:33.124
I'll be on a ship
in the North Sea.

05:33.126 --> 05:34.475
On a ship?

05:34.477 --> 05:38.229
Aren't they afraid Hawking will
just roll overboard?

05:38.231 --> 05:40.498
Uh, he's not gonna be there.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.618
He's just sending a team
to research his theory.

05:43.620 --> 05:44.835
Oh, sure.

05:44.837 --> 05:48.489
Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.210
Wow. Okay.

05:52.212 --> 05:53.827
Four months.

05:53.829 --> 05:55.413
Yeah.

05:55.415 --> 05:56.964
And I'm a little worried

05:56.966 --> 05:59.584
because things
between us have been so great,

05:59.586 --> 06:02.336
and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.

06:02.338 --> 06:04.338
Oh, sweetie,
if you're gonna screw things up,

06:04.340 --> 06:07.191
it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.

06:07.193 --> 06:09.393
Oh.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.748
No. I mean, look,
you have to go.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.683
It sounds like
an amazing opportunity.

06:15.685 --> 06:16.951
And I'm just basing that

06:16.953 --> 06:19.654
on how much I didn't understand
what you said about it.

06:19.656 --> 06:22.323
Okay.

06:22.325 --> 06:24.992
I'll confirm the travel
arrangements in the morning.

06:24.994 --> 06:26.711
Okay. Good.

06:26.713 --> 06:28.796
I do have to ask
you one favor.

06:28.798 --> 06:30.064
Sure.

06:30.066 --> 06:31.249
Sheldon's nervous
about me leaving.

06:31.251 --> 06:33.084
Just keep an eye on him
while I'm gone.

06:33.086 --> 06:34.869
Oh, I don't know.

06:34.871 --> 06:38.589
Remember what happened when
I took care of your goldfish?

06:38.591 --> 06:41.909
Well, flush Sheldon down
the toilet and get me a new one.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.048
Really, you guys do not need
to throw me a going-away party.

06:48.050 --> 06:49.216
Are you kidding me?

06:49.218 --> 06:51.902
How often can you say
"Bon voyage" to somebody

06:51.904 --> 06:54.822
when they're actually going
on a <i>voyage?</i>

06:56.658 --> 06:58.075
Hello, Rajesh.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.081
Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

07:06.735 --> 07:09.236
What can I say?
It's funnier with the accent.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.905
There's beer in the fridge.

07:11.907 --> 07:14.759
Anyway, you guys really don't
need to make a big deal.

07:14.761 --> 07:16.277
Leonard, you're being selfish.

07:16.279 --> 07:19.246
We need to give you a proper
send-off so we'll have closure

07:19.248 --> 07:21.932
when you die at sea
and crabs eat your face.

07:22.934 --> 07:25.186
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

07:25.188 --> 07:26.887
You know, one of the things

07:26.889 --> 07:29.273
that helped me get through
Howard being in space

07:29.275 --> 07:31.925
for so long was getting
married before he left.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.832
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

07:38.817 --> 07:40.067
Okay.

07:40.069 --> 07:41.485
I have a request to make.

07:41.487 --> 07:43.487
And now he can talk.

07:43.489 --> 07:45.456
I want to cut open your brain

07:45.458 --> 07:47.875
and see what the heck's
going on in there.

07:49.711 --> 07:52.880
The only person allowed
inside this head is Dr. Phil.

07:52.882 --> 07:54.782
Anyway,

07:54.784 --> 07:57.051
I-I spoke to my new lady friend
about meeting you all,

07:57.053 --> 07:59.003
and she thought
it would be easier for her

07:59.005 --> 08:00.171
to start with just one.

08:00.173 --> 08:01.922
Oh, gee, I don't know.

08:01.924 --> 08:04.124
My schedule's a little busy.

08:04.126 --> 08:06.510
Actually,
I was thinking Leonard.

08:06.512 --> 08:08.229
Oh. Thank you, Raj.

08:08.231 --> 08:09.347
I'd be honored.

08:09.349 --> 08:10.598
What the hell?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.900
I thought
I was your best friend.

08:12.902 --> 08:15.903
You are, but you've got
kind of a big personality,

08:15.905 --> 08:19.740
with your flashy clothes and
your Woody Allen swagger.

08:21.476 --> 08:22.943
You know,

08:22.945 --> 08:25.646
maybe she'd be more comfortable
meeting a girl first.

08:25.648 --> 08:27.081
Good idea. Bernadette?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.250
What the hell?!

08:29.252 --> 08:31.035
Well, you're very pretty.

08:31.037 --> 08:32.820
That could be intimidating
to another woman.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.988
Oh, yeah.

08:34.990 --> 08:38.042
Hey, you don't think I'm pretty
enough to scare your girlfriend?

08:38.044 --> 08:39.827
Calm down, Bernie.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.629
You're very scary.

08:43.465 --> 08:44.765
It should be me.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.016
Why?

08:46.018 --> 08:48.386
So you can make jokes
about cutting open my brain?

08:48.388 --> 08:51.004
A, that was not a joke.

08:51.006 --> 08:53.057
That was a sincere request.

08:54.393 --> 08:56.143
And B, more
importantly,

08:56.145 --> 08:57.695
I was the outsider
to this group,

08:57.697 --> 08:59.864
and I know how frightening
that can be.

08:59.866 --> 09:02.900
But you guys took me in
and made me feel loved,

09:02.902 --> 09:05.119
like I was family.

09:08.206 --> 09:09.907
Fine, I'll do it.

09:12.694 --> 09:14.862
So, after I started
dating Sheldon,

09:14.864 --> 09:17.364
I met Leonard,
and then everybody else,

09:17.366 --> 09:19.834
and they've all been
so wonderful to me.

09:19.836 --> 09:21.218
That's really nice to hear.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.370
Maybe next week,
we could all get together.

09:23.372 --> 09:25.473
Oh, Lucy, you don't
have to answer that.

09:25.475 --> 09:27.975
Don't put her on the
spot. She hates that.

09:27.977 --> 09:30.043
Am I right? Tell her
how much you hate

09:30.045 --> 09:32.263
being put on the spot.
Go ahead, tell her.

09:32.265 --> 09:34.849
Ignore him. He's a little
nervous 'cause he doesn't think

09:34.851 --> 09:36.567
I understand the severity
of your social anxiety.

09:36.569 --> 09:38.652
What the...?
Are you crazy?

09:38.654 --> 09:39.720
You can't talk
about social anxiety

09:39.722 --> 09:41.272
to someone who has
social anxiety.

09:41.274 --> 09:44.275
It makes them
socially anxious!

09:44.277 --> 09:46.110
Excuse me, but I'm
a neurobiologist.

09:46.112 --> 09:48.362
I think I'm a little
more qualified than you

09:48.364 --> 09:51.615
to understand what's not working
in your girlfriend's brain!

09:51.617 --> 09:52.750
Don't call her my girlfriend.

09:52.752 --> 09:54.452
We haven't discussed
whether or not

09:54.454 --> 09:55.953
we're girlfriend
or boyfriend yet.

09:57.405 --> 09:58.956
Now that it's
out there...

10:00.792 --> 10:02.560
...are you my girlfriend?

10:02.562 --> 10:03.694
By the way,
if you say no,

10:03.696 --> 10:06.297
I'll never be happy again.

10:07.282 --> 10:09.283
Not to put you on the spot.

10:10.869 --> 10:13.604
I think I have to go
to the bathroom.

10:17.692 --> 10:19.109
We might as well
go ahead and eat.

10:19.111 --> 10:20.861
She's not coming back
anytime soon.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:29.956 --> 10:31.173
This is ridiculous.

10:31.174 --> 10:32.906
We're shopping
for a party.

10:32.908 --> 10:34.709
This store doesn't even
have a party section.

10:34.711 --> 10:37.912
Yeah, it does,
and here we are.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.965
You know, I have to say, Penny,

10:40.967 --> 10:43.134
I don't understand
why you of all people

10:43.136 --> 10:45.519
are encouraging Leonard
to do this.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.921
Well, I'm his girlfriend;
of course I'm gonna support him.

10:47.923 --> 10:50.141
Yeah, well,
you're his girlfriend for now.

10:50.143 --> 10:51.926
You know, maybe
you're not aware of this,

10:51.928 --> 10:53.928
but there is
a rich tradition

10:53.930 --> 10:58.199
of men at sea finding comfort in
each other's arms and britches.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.703
Honey, this is a big
deal for Leonard, okay?

11:02.705 --> 11:04.538
He gets to work with
Stephen Hawking.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.707
Who, by the way,
will not be on the boat.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.775
I checked it out.

11:07.777 --> 11:10.110
It's not that big
of an opportunity.

11:10.112 --> 11:12.480
And even if Hawking's theories
are correct,

11:12.482 --> 11:15.049
all they prove is
where the universe came from,

11:15.051 --> 11:17.969
why everything exists and
what its ultimate end will be.

11:17.971 --> 11:19.820
I mean, me?

11:19.822 --> 11:22.390
I'm interested
in the big questions.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.795
Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius
is jealous of Leonard.

11:27.797 --> 11:29.513
I'm not jealous.

11:29.515 --> 11:31.182
I'm just very unhappy

11:31.184 --> 11:33.017
that good things
are happening for him

11:33.019 --> 11:34.935
and not happening for me.

11:34.937 --> 11:37.655
Look, sweetie, this is
a natural thing to feel, okay?

11:37.657 --> 11:39.640
But just because good things
are happening to Leonard

11:39.642 --> 11:41.492
doesn't take anything
away from you.

11:41.494 --> 11:43.411
You know what? Let me
tell you a little story.

11:43.413 --> 11:45.446
Once there was a girl who worked
at the Cheesecake Factory,

11:45.448 --> 11:46.998
and she wasn't very good
at her job.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.617
It was you.
It wasn't me.

11:50.619 --> 11:51.669
But she was also an actress,

11:51.671 --> 11:53.404
and we were both up
for the same part

11:53.406 --> 11:54.455
in a toothpaste commercial.

11:54.457 --> 11:56.757
She got it. Look,
I was so jealous.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.326
But instead of ripping out
her fake blonde hair...

11:59.328 --> 12:01.429
You ripped out
your own fake blonde hair.

12:01.431 --> 12:03.097
I...

12:03.099 --> 12:04.849
looked her in the eye,

12:04.851 --> 12:07.168
smiled and said,
"I'm happy for you."

12:07.170 --> 12:08.836
Because that's what friends do.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.473
They lie
so they don't look petty.

12:12.475 --> 12:13.607
Yeah.

12:13.609 --> 12:14.942
How?

12:14.944 --> 12:17.078
Like this.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.880
I am so happy for you.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.751
Wow.

12:23.753 --> 12:26.404
No wonder you didn't get
that toothpaste commercial.

12:30.075 --> 12:31.859
Hey.

12:31.861 --> 12:33.294
Hi.

12:33.296 --> 12:35.629
I want to apologize
for Amy last night.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.031
She was completely out of line.

12:43.171 --> 12:45.639
Are you... are you
not speaking to me

12:45.641 --> 12:47.475
or did the screen freeze again?

12:47.477 --> 12:49.744
Amy wasn't the problem.

12:49.746 --> 12:51.762
Okay. I know.

12:51.764 --> 12:53.397
It was me.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.366
I-I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.

12:55.368 --> 12:56.817
Thank you.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.770
You know,
I-I've been thinking that...

12:59.772 --> 13:03.140
maybe meeting somebody
one-on-one is too intense,

13:03.142 --> 13:04.341
so...

13:04.343 --> 13:06.177
Friday night, my friends
are having a party.

13:06.179 --> 13:07.878
A party?
A little one!

13:07.880 --> 13:10.448
It's-it's a farewell
for Leonard,

13:10.450 --> 13:12.666
so all the attention
will be on him.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.419
If you wear something brown
and sit on the couch,

13:15.421 --> 13:17.471
they won't even know
you're there.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.374
I'm not sure.

13:20.376 --> 13:21.509
Oh, please?

13:21.511 --> 13:22.777
Raj.
Come on.

13:22.779 --> 13:23.911
Don't make me beg.

13:23.913 --> 13:27.131
And I'm from India,
so I know how to do it.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.634
Okay.

13:30.636 --> 13:31.752
Y... Thank you!

13:31.754 --> 13:33.270
Th-This means a lot to me.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.022
My friends are like my family.

13:35.674 --> 13:36.941
Unless you don't like them;

13:36.943 --> 13:39.210
in which case,
they're dead to me.

13:41.697 --> 13:44.264
So, have you ever spent
a long time on a boat before?

13:44.266 --> 13:46.200
Yeah.
Are you referring to the time

13:46.202 --> 13:49.403
we got stuck on the Small World
ride at Disneyland?

13:50.238 --> 13:52.156
Yeah.

13:54.810 --> 13:56.327
I'm proud of you, Leonard.

13:56.329 --> 13:58.162
Working out
on the North Sea

13:58.164 --> 14:00.948
for months--
that's really something.

14:00.950 --> 14:02.833
I know. As far as science goes,

14:02.835 --> 14:05.118
this is the adventure
of a lifetime.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.954
Maybe your lifetime.

14:06.956 --> 14:09.140
I went to space.

14:10.425 --> 14:12.309
It's not a competition.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.677
You're right, you're right.

14:13.679 --> 14:15.262
I'm really proud of you, and...

14:15.264 --> 14:17.148
I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone.

14:18.183 --> 14:20.701
And space beats water.

14:22.387 --> 14:25.406
Rajesh, I thought
Lucy was coming.

14:25.408 --> 14:27.408
She is. She's just running
a little late.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.743
You know how it is--
girls always fussing about

14:29.745 --> 14:30.978
their hair, their makeup.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.163
She'll be here.

14:32.165 --> 14:34.215
Just give it a rest, okay?

14:37.119 --> 14:40.221
Um, can I have
your attention, everyone?

14:41.673 --> 14:44.925
That's, uh, B-flat, for those
who don't have perfect pitch.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.712
I would like
to propose a toast

14:48.714 --> 14:51.799
to my best friend,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

14:51.801 --> 14:55.553
He has been presented with
a wonderful opportunity,

14:55.555 --> 14:58.772
and I couldn't
be happier for him.

15:01.476 --> 15:02.693
Thank you, Sheldon.

15:02.695 --> 15:04.812
That must've been
very hard for you to say.

15:04.814 --> 15:06.697
Well, I mean it.

15:06.699 --> 15:09.349
I'm really happy
for you.

15:09.351 --> 15:12.203
And that's how you get
a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

15:13.021 --> 15:14.755
Cheers.
Cheers.

15:16.491 --> 15:19.994
It was really nice of you
to try to be happy for Leonard.

15:19.996 --> 15:21.495
Mm. Thank you.

15:21.497 --> 15:24.197
It must've killed you
when I went to space.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.453
Oh, no.

15:29.455 --> 15:31.672
Buddy, you okay?

15:33.842 --> 15:36.176
Oh, man.

15:36.178 --> 15:38.262
What's going on?

15:38.264 --> 15:40.147
Uh, go ahead. Read it.

15:40.149 --> 15:42.349
"Raj, I can't come
to the party.

15:42.351 --> 15:43.684
"This is all just

15:43.686 --> 15:45.352
"too much for me.

15:45.354 --> 15:48.239
"I don't think
we should see

15:48.241 --> 15:50.441
"each other anymore.
Sorry.

15:50.443 --> 15:52.443
Lucy."

15:52.445 --> 15:54.111
Excuse me.

15:54.113 --> 15:56.780
Raj, I'm so sorry.

15:56.782 --> 15:59.016
Me, too.

16:01.704 --> 16:05.172
It did not kill me
when you went to space.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.761
Monkeys went to space.

16:15.384 --> 16:16.884
Well, here we are.

16:16.886 --> 16:18.686
Yep.

16:18.688 --> 16:21.105
I'm really gonna miss you.

16:21.107 --> 16:22.806
I'm gonna miss you, too.

16:22.808 --> 16:25.109
Penny, we're
in the red zone.

16:26.061 --> 16:28.696
The white zone
is for loading and unloading.

16:28.698 --> 16:31.198
We're breaking the law.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.483
Okay, there's no space

16:32.485 --> 16:33.901
in the white zone, so...
Anyway,

16:33.903 --> 16:37.237
we can e-mail, and I-I think
the phone connections

16:37.239 --> 16:38.455
are pretty good.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.291
All right, you have to get
out of the car right now.

16:40.293 --> 16:41.575
I'm not going
to jail for you.

16:41.577 --> 16:42.609
Would you just relax?

16:42.611 --> 16:44.878
Oh, I see a space
in the white zone.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.381
Quick, circle the airport.

16:47.383 --> 16:49.249
Did you bring enough inhalers?

16:49.251 --> 16:50.551
Yeah.

16:50.553 --> 16:51.802
And, uh, extra Dramamine?

16:51.804 --> 16:54.421
You remember what happened
on It's a Small World.

16:54.423 --> 16:55.723
I'm covered.

16:55.725 --> 16:56.957
Okay.

16:56.959 --> 16:58.676
Oh, dear Lord,
a police officer's

16:58.678 --> 16:59.927
glancing in our direction.

16:59.929 --> 17:02.396
We've been made.

17:03.264 --> 17:05.683
Calm down.
I'm getting out.

17:05.685 --> 17:07.401
I have something
I want to give you.

17:07.403 --> 17:08.902
Oh, Leonard.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.387
It's just a heart-shaped
locket with a picture of

17:10.388 --> 17:12.406
Leonard's face in it. He got
it at the mall on clearance.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.273
Now move, move, move!

17:15.109 --> 17:17.194
I love you.

17:17.195 --> 17:19.363
I love you, too.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.701
Don't worry, Officer.

17:23.703 --> 17:25.318
They just love each other.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.871
We're not smuggling drugs.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.846
Raj, it's Penny.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.214
Are you in there?

17:37.216 --> 17:38.932
Hang on.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.520
Hey. I'm just coming back
from the airport.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.439
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

17:45.441 --> 17:46.974
That's-that's very nice of you.

17:46.976 --> 17:48.842
Uh, come, come. Come on in.

17:48.844 --> 17:50.444
Can't stay long.

17:50.446 --> 17:53.714
I left Sheldon in the car
with the window cracked open.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.651
He's gonna go through
that activity book

17:57.653 --> 17:59.820
in, like, 30 seconds, so...

18:00.805 --> 18:02.639
Are you okay?

18:04.142 --> 18:05.309
No.

18:05.311 --> 18:07.194
Oh.

18:07.196 --> 18:09.362
I'm so sorry.

18:09.364 --> 18:10.497
No.

18:10.499 --> 18:12.249
It's my fault.

18:12.251 --> 18:15.302
You know, I finally found
someone who was right for me,

18:15.304 --> 18:17.938
and I-I drove her away.

18:17.940 --> 18:21.341
Oh, Raj.

18:21.343 --> 18:23.427
Penny, I...

18:23.429 --> 18:25.479
I miss her already.

18:25.481 --> 18:26.947
I know how you feel.

18:26.949 --> 18:28.198
I miss Leonard, too.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.551
What's... what is
wrong with me?

18:31.553 --> 18:34.438
Why-why can't I
ever have love?

18:34.440 --> 18:35.722
You will.

18:35.724 --> 18:38.025
No, I... I won't.

18:38.027 --> 18:39.576
I'm-I'm unlovable.

18:39.578 --> 18:42.579
That's just
the booze talking.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.064
No, it's not.

18:44.066 --> 18:46.784
I haven't had a drink
since last night.

18:55.210 --> 18:57.211
You're talking to me.

18:57.213 --> 18:58.896
I am.

19:00.216 --> 19:03.050
And now I'm crying for
a whole different reason!

19:03.052 --> 19:04.601
Me, too!

19:13.368 --> 19:14.988
So I-I guess
what I'm saying is.

19:15.013 --> 19:16.880
I get where Lucy's
coming from.

19:16.881 --> 19:18.631
That's great.
Do you want some wine?

19:18.633 --> 19:20.082
Uh, no, water's fine.

19:20.084 --> 19:22.852
Anyhow, I-I've been
thinking about it a lot,

19:22.854 --> 19:25.804
and-and I totally see
why Lucy did what she did.

19:25.806 --> 19:26.722
I pushed too hard.

19:26.724 --> 19:28.257
But you know what?
If I back off

19:28.259 --> 19:30.342
and give her enough space,
maybe there's still

19:30.344 --> 19:31.727
a future for us.

19:31.729 --> 19:34.013
Yeah, the funny thing about life
is that, you know, sometimes...

19:34.015 --> 19:37.149
Does he ever shut up?
