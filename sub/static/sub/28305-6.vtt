WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:02.872
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
All righty, friends and foes,

00:02.915 --> 00:04.569
You recall Jane
was in the middle

00:04.613 --> 00:06.832
of a classic love triangle.
On one side,

00:06.876 --> 00:09.661
her ex-husband Michael
came back from the dead.

00:09.705 --> 00:10.880
I still love you, Jane.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.012
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
On the other,

00:12.055 --> 00:14.144
ex-boyfriend,
baby daddy Rafael.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.406
RAFAEL:
All I want

00:15.450 --> 00:17.800
is to put this ring
on your finger.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.106
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And our poor Jane,

00:19.149 --> 00:20.803
well, she was wrecked,

00:20.846 --> 00:22.152
and she realized...

00:22.196 --> 00:24.763
I can't just dismiss
how I feel about Michael.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.026
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, seemingly,

00:26.069 --> 00:28.680
sent our Rafael
down a dark path.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.074
Also in a tricky
situation, Alba.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.903
See, she married Jorge so
he could get his green card.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.122
Only, she still
had feelings for him.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.949
Oh, and Petra and J.R.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.648
seemed like they were headed
for a breakup, too.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.911
Please!I gave up everything
for you.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.521
It was all a lie!

00:43.565 --> 00:45.045
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But they fought their way

00:45.088 --> 00:47.134
back to each other,
not that they were home free.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.352
I didn't e-mail Milos.

00:48.396 --> 00:49.701
It's right here, Petra,

00:49.745 --> 00:50.876
how you said you won't testify

00:50.920 --> 00:52.748
against him if he
gives you the hotel.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.141
What are you
talking about?

00:54.184 --> 00:56.491
I didn't write this.It's from your account.

00:56.534 --> 00:57.753
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know!

00:57.796 --> 00:59.102
Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

00:59.146 --> 01:02.236
Well, imagine this.
Rose, aka Sin Rostro,

01:02.279 --> 01:05.369
was the one who faked Michael's death and wiped his memories.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.675
Tell me why you did it.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.677
ROSE:
I had my Eileen face on,

01:08.720 --> 01:09.982
and my phone fell.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.463
And as we both bent down
to pick it up,

01:12.507 --> 01:14.074
my mask came unglued.

01:14.117 --> 01:17.207
I don't believe you.
I think it has something to do

01:17.251 --> 01:18.861
with this number.

01:18.904 --> 01:22.038
So you're working
with the police now.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.083
Tell them

01:23.126 --> 01:25.041
there's no chance in hell

01:25.085 --> 01:27.217
they'll ever figure out
what that number is.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.479
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yikes!

01:28.523 --> 01:30.090
Who knows what she's up to.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.788
Well, I do,
but I can't tell you... yet.

01:32.831 --> 01:36.008
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:36.052 --> 01:37.880
was 25 years old,

01:37.923 --> 01:39.229
she said good-bye

01:39.273 --> 01:41.710
to Michael Cordero Jr.
for the last time...

01:41.753 --> 01:43.799
I love you.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or so she thought.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.105
Michael!

01:45.148 --> 01:47.933
I am so proud of you.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.240
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, that good-bye

01:50.284 --> 01:53.243
was a moment that Jane
replayed in her head over

01:53.287 --> 01:55.506
and over and over...

01:55.550 --> 01:57.073
XIOMARA:
Enough.

01:57.117 --> 02:01.860
You can't keep looking at old
pictures of Michael. Call him.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.907
I want to. I-I-I'm trying.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.257
But every time I think I'm
ready, I think about my family,

02:07.301 --> 02:08.911
and how much I love Rafael.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.739
Who doesn't want
to see you now.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.088
Because of my feelings
for Michael.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.307
Exactly.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.744
You have them,
so call.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.008
What's going on?

02:21.750 --> 02:22.490
BOTH:
What?

02:22.533 --> 02:24.448
Sexy...

02:31.063 --> 02:33.762
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sorry. Let me show you what Alba sees.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.505
Oh, who am I kidding?

02:37.548 --> 02:39.463
It's not even sexy
in slow motion.

02:46.775 --> 02:50.082
Ma! Uh, we were talking about
something really important.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.351
Agreed.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.744
Start slow.There is no slow.

02:59.788 --> 03:02.530
If I open the door,
the floodwaters will rush in.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.750
It is not a floodgate,
it's just a text. Send it.

03:06.795 --> 03:11.408
Okay. Fine. Fine.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.280
"Hi."

03:13.323 --> 03:14.977
I told you it wasn't
just a text!

03:15.020 --> 03:16.239
He's already calling me back!

03:16.283 --> 03:17.371
Answer it.

03:19.329 --> 03:20.765
Hi, hey.MICHAEL: Hey.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.680
Do you have any time
this afternoon?

03:22.724 --> 03:25.379
Um, can you hang on a second?

03:25.422 --> 03:27.381
Now what? He wants to hang out.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.947
Uh, you think that's
gonna be casual?

03:28.991 --> 03:30.471
I mean, what are we supposed
to talk about? The weather?

03:30.514 --> 03:33.778
Oh, or how about the fact
that I'm living at home again

03:33.822 --> 03:35.476
because Rafael
kicked me out of the house

03:35.519 --> 03:36.955
because I had to explore things

03:36.999 --> 03:39.131
with Michael even though
I don't know what that means?

03:39.175 --> 03:40.785
A-And how is that even possible?
What am I supposed to do? Huh?

03:40.829 --> 03:44.354
Put on my wedding lingerie and
say, "Welcome back, to this."

03:44.398 --> 03:48.140
Take a deep breath
and calm down.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.273
Just grab some coffee
with him. Decaf.

03:50.317 --> 03:53.320
Right. Okay. Yeah.

03:56.105 --> 03:59.891
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh,
she hit "speaker," not "mute."

03:59.935 --> 04:01.284
Michael?

04:01.328 --> 04:05.288
Hi. Yeah, coffee sounds good.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.952
MICHAEL: But that's
not why I was calling.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.780
DENNIS: We think Rose lied
about the reason

04:18.823 --> 04:19.998
she gave Michael amnesia.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.087
She said she bumped into me
as Eileen...

04:22.131 --> 04:24.089
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You remember Eileen, right?

04:24.133 --> 04:25.787
Rose... only with this mask.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.832
And she said I saw
her mask, but I didn't.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.008
I mean I would remember
seeing a mask peel off.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.359
So why do you
think she did it?

04:32.402 --> 04:34.361
We don't know, but we think
it has something

04:34.404 --> 04:36.363
to do with this number
I wrote down in my notes.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.190
It's a sequence she typed
over and over.

04:38.234 --> 04:42.151
And before I... died,
I'd been focused on it

04:42.194 --> 04:44.588
'cause it came up so much
in Susanna's keystroke log.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.808
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You remember Susanna, right?

04:46.851 --> 04:49.811
Rose... only with this mask.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.813
Oops, my bad, that's Shelly.

04:51.856 --> 04:55.643
Sorry, Rose had a lot of masks.
Here's Susanna.

04:55.686 --> 04:59.603
Oh, wow. I... I can't believe

04:59.647 --> 05:01.997
you were still investigating
Rose after you left the force.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.478
Oh, just occasionally.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.350
I mean, the woman's
a monster

05:07.394 --> 05:09.178
and she was still out there.

05:09.221 --> 05:11.963
Oh, my God, Michael!

05:12.007 --> 05:14.009
The thing is, I've been
going through my memories

05:14.052 --> 05:17.099
a thousand times of that day,
and it's all pretty fuzzy.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.623
Unfortunately, memories
are notoriously unreliable.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.669
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I think I
said something like that once,

05:21.712 --> 05:23.279
but I can't quite remember.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.543
Anyway, uh, Dennis suggested we
walk through the day together.

05:26.587 --> 05:29.067
See if any details come back.

05:29.111 --> 05:33.202
Yeah, okay, sure.

05:35.291 --> 05:39.295
So you and Rafael broke up?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.906
I don't want to talk
about that with you.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.431
Okay. That's fine.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.347
I'm... I'm sorry.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.914
I'm just confused,
as you obviously heard.

05:49.958 --> 05:53.353
No, I get it. Let's just
walk through the day, then.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.398
Great. Uh...

05:55.442 --> 05:58.314
I remember everything exactly.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.796
Uh, we said good-bye in the
doorway of our old apartment.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.406
I had given you a lunchbox

06:03.450 --> 06:06.540
with a policeman on it,
and then I said... Michael!

06:06.583 --> 06:10.674
I am so proud of you.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.590
What's so funny?
Oh...

06:13.634 --> 06:16.593
I can't believe I brought
a lunchbox to the LSATs.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.552
It was sweet.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.902
Oh, I know, of course it was.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.078
It's just weird to think
about now. You know, the guys

06:23.121 --> 06:25.428
at the ranch would hog-tie me
and throw me in the pigsty

06:25.472 --> 06:28.562
if they found out that I brought
a lunchbox to work.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.651
Right.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.783
It's just hard to laugh
since the lunchbox

06:32.827 --> 06:35.133
is tied to the last words
I ever said to you

06:35.177 --> 06:37.266
before you supposedly died.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.008
Right. I'm sorry.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.271
But actually,

06:42.314 --> 06:44.099
those weren't the last words
you said to me.

06:44.142 --> 06:47.798
Trust me, I replayed
that moment over and over.

06:47.842 --> 06:48.799
No.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.279
I remember. You said...

06:50.322 --> 06:52.455
I am so proud of you.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.327
MICHAEL:
And then I turned back.

06:55.371 --> 06:58.461
Oh, your gas tank's on empty,

06:58.505 --> 07:00.681
so don't forget to fill it up
before your meeting with Chloe.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.466
Thanks. Now hurry up and go.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.164
Oh, my God. I...

07:06.208 --> 07:08.645
I can't believe
I forgot about that.

07:10.473 --> 07:13.041
And then I sent you
a final "good luck" e-mail

07:13.084 --> 07:15.304
while I was pumping gas,
and you never responded.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.784
I definitely replied.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.482
No, you didn't.
If you sent that e-mail,

07:19.526 --> 07:23.007
I would've read it obsessively
for the last four years.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.792
No, I-I know I sent that.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.797
Uh, hello?

07:29.840 --> 07:33.409
Okay, I-I'm sorry.
I'm on my way.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.367
It's Mateo's karate dojo.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.805
Rafael didn't show up
to pick him up. I have to go.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.720
Rafael?

07:39.763 --> 07:41.591
Shoot, they called you?

07:43.201 --> 07:45.334
I'm sorry. I-I messed up.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.336
Is everything okay?

07:47.379 --> 07:49.294
I'm fine.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.905
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, friends.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.560
How Jane wanted to reach out
and touch him right then,

07:53.603 --> 07:56.258
but alas, everything
had changed.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.608
Just have a lot of stuff
going on at the office.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.218
In fact, since you're here,
do you mind

08:00.262 --> 08:02.525
just taking Mateo
and the girls?

08:02.569 --> 08:04.745
I should-- got to
get back to work.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.877
Yeah, no problem.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.103
How was karate practice?

08:15.146 --> 08:16.844
Good, I'm amazing!

08:16.887 --> 08:18.541
Do it.
Ask her.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.890
Ask me what?

08:19.934 --> 08:21.370
What are drugs?

08:21.413 --> 08:22.850
Excuse me?

08:22.893 --> 08:24.373
I saw Daddy taking pills,

08:24.416 --> 08:26.288
and Ellie and Anna
said he's on drugs.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.297
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you'll recall,

08:35.340 --> 08:37.125
we last left Jane with a very
simple question...

08:37.168 --> 08:38.387
JANE:
What are drugs? Uh...

08:38.430 --> 08:42.304
Well, drugs are
a very bad thing,

08:42.347 --> 08:45.133
and something you should
never, ever take. And also,

08:45.176 --> 08:48.136
Daddy is not taking drugs,
so don't worry about that.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.878
Yes, he is. He's got
a real pill problem.

08:50.921 --> 08:54.316
What? No, he doesn't.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.536
But what-what
makes you say that?

08:56.579 --> 08:57.885
We saw him take them.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.800
Grown-ups take a lot of pills.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.802
Vitamins and aspirin...

09:01.845 --> 09:03.325
These are different.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.457
Daddy always takes
his pills in secret

09:05.501 --> 09:08.417
and keeps them on the top shelf
of the bathroom cabinet

09:08.460 --> 09:10.027
where we can't
reach them.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.290
They're probably benzos.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.336
What?

09:14.379 --> 09:16.425
Mommy left the parental controls
off the iPad last week,

09:16.468 --> 09:19.515
and we watched a lot
of inappropriate shows.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.214
We know all about
the opioid crisis, too.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.782
Well, good for you,

09:25.826 --> 09:28.393
and that has nothing
to do with your dad.

09:28.437 --> 09:31.266
We need to talk.
Fine.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.659
Make it quick.
I'm preparing for a meeting

09:32.702 --> 09:34.530
with a computer security
expert to get

09:34.574 --> 09:36.880
to the bottom of the weird
e-mails coming from my account.

09:36.924 --> 09:40.275
Preparing by looking at
the IT guy's vacation photos?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.886
If you must know,

09:42.930 --> 09:46.368
the computer security expert
is J.R.'s close friend, Leona.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.413
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, IT gal.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.459
I've never met any
of J.R.'s friends before,

09:50.502 --> 09:52.156
so I'm just...
doing a little research.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.855
Got it. Well, um,

09:54.898 --> 09:57.248
I wanted to talk to you about
something serious, but honestly

09:57.292 --> 09:59.076
I don't even know
how to say it, but...

09:59.120 --> 10:00.338
Spit it out, Jane.

10:00.382 --> 10:03.428
Right. Sorry. I'm just...

10:03.472 --> 10:05.735
I'm worried about Rafael,
and I want to talk to him

10:05.779 --> 10:08.390
and be there for him,
and obviously I can't,

10:08.433 --> 10:10.697
but I think he might be
in a really dark place.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.307
Of course he's in a dark place.
You dumped him.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.266
The kids think he's on drugs.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.920
What?The twins saw him

10:16.964 --> 10:19.488
taking pills in secret.
Apparently, Mateo did, too.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.098
So can you please talk to him?

10:21.142 --> 10:24.928
You're probably overreacting,
like you always do.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.365
Sorry, did I do something
to offend you?

10:27.409 --> 10:29.063
I'll talk to Rafael and
figure out what's going on.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.499
Now, go. J.R.'s
coming by and if

10:30.542 --> 10:32.544
she sees you,
she'll be in a bad mood.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.340
Rafael, hey, it's me, um--

10:45.383 --> 10:47.951
Just hoping to talk
when you get a minute.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.692
ROGELIO:
Talk dirty to me, baby.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.739
Tell me how much you want
the carnal gift of Rogelio.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.524
So, so much.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.569
It's been too long.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.919
Way too long.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.881
Oh, but you're sexier than ever.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.796
Mm-hmm?And, uh...

11:06.840 --> 11:08.580
Oh, my God.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.408
Your penis got even bigger.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.587
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.857
It's no big deal.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.380
Masturbation is normal.

11:25.423 --> 11:29.210
It's just that I really miss
making love to you.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.082
But I don't want to pressure you
before you're ready.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.258
I get it. It's fine.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.521
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, don't beat yourself...

11:36.565 --> 11:38.698
um, up about it, Rogelio.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.308
And I miss our sex life, too.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.701
And I want it back.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.180
You do?

11:44.399 --> 11:47.315
But, I just haven't
really felt like it.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.709
A-After everything my body's
been through this year.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.625
But maybe it's time we try.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.062
What about tonight?

11:55.105 --> 11:59.719
We could go out on a date
and then...

11:59.762 --> 12:01.721
I'm in.
Metaphorically.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.160
And also, hopefully, literally.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.596
LEONA:
You're screwed.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.772
What do you mean?Well, your
anti-virus program

12:09.816 --> 12:13.210
is ancient; pretty much
any experienced hacker

12:13.254 --> 12:14.516
could just spoof
your IP address.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.387
Of course.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.259
See? It's Milos.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.435
I filed an injunction
against him to regain
control of the hotel.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.784
He's obviously
retaliating.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.438
Can you secure it?

12:23.481 --> 12:25.353
Yeah, no problem.Mm.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.615
Okay, perfect, thank you.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.660
Well, take that, Genius Bar.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.448
By the way, I
really dig your ink.

12:34.666 --> 12:35.972
Thanks.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.453
Do you have a go-to
artist or anything?

12:38.496 --> 12:40.629
I-I'm considering
getting one of my own.Really?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.457
Of what?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.633
Uh, butterfly? Lower back.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.504
I love that idea.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.592
Thanks, Leona.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.768
You should go.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.204
I should get going, too.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.119
I have to go to the,
uh, animal shelter.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.035
What are you talking about?

12:55.078 --> 12:56.558
Oh, I was, um,

12:56.601 --> 12:58.473
thinking of using
the security breach

12:58.516 --> 13:00.518
as an excuse to get
the girls a dog.

13:00.562 --> 13:01.737
They've been asking.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.130
I'm a big fan of dogs.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.696
Rescues only,
obviously.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.744
You are?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.267
Yes.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.052
Have you been stalking me
on Instagram?

13:12.095 --> 13:13.575
RAMOS:
Down, lioness.

13:13.618 --> 13:16.317
Petra was obviously just curious
about my good friend.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.798
My apologies.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.930
Best of luck
with the rescue dog.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.759
I'll see you at
Truck Shop tomorrow?Um, we'll see.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.196
Uh-huh.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.504
Wow, she hated me.

13:29.547 --> 13:30.897
She didn't hate you.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.376
That much.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.511
Next time just play it
more low-key.

13:36.554 --> 13:40.297
Make your creepy,
stalker hints more subtle.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.516
Next time when?

13:41.559 --> 13:43.126
Leona blatantly
didn't invite me

13:43.170 --> 13:45.563
to the truck
shop tomorrow.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.218
She's not really hanging out
at a truck shop, right?

13:48.262 --> 13:50.568
No.
It's a gay club.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.570
And she didn't invite you...

13:52.614 --> 13:54.572
'cause, well...

13:54.616 --> 13:56.400
you don't exactly look
like the club type.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.533
What does that mean?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.709
You're too posh
for the club scene.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.798
I am not, I
love nightclubs.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.018
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yep, nightclubs
and rescue dogs.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.410
Petra's favorites.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.457
Okay, look...

14:09.500 --> 14:14.679
I want to try... getting to know
your life more.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.638
Leona's important to you.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.945
So she's important to me, too.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.210
Okay.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.734
Come. Yeah.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.650
JANE: I don't have
a good feeling about this.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.131
I want to help, but
digging into the past

14:31.174 --> 14:32.480
is bringing up
all these memories

14:32.523 --> 14:34.308
from when Michael was
investigating Rose

14:34.351 --> 14:36.049
and got shot on
our wedding night.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.799
Abuela.
Ay!

14:54.850 --> 14:57.374
No, Michael definitely
didn't write it.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.636
I definitely
wrote it.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.029
I just can't
remember my password.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.726
I tried everything
I could think of.

15:01.770 --> 15:05.121
Try M-L-J-T-M-5-1-9.

15:05.165 --> 15:08.472
Five, one, nine.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.996
Good memory.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.607
Well, it stands for Michael
Loves Jane The Mostest.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.478
Oh, wow.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.611
And 5/19 is our
wedding anniversary.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.830
What?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.571
Nothing, it's just,

15:20.615 --> 15:22.225
I was a lot sappier
than I remember.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.879
You weren't sappy.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.055
You were romantic.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.404
I'm sorry.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.623
Didn't mean
it like that.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.581
It's definitely romantic.Can you just

15:30.625 --> 15:32.757
please find the e-mail
that you claim to have sent?Okay.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.804
I know I wrote it.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.371
Okay, here it is.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.677
You wrote, "All
gassed up, good luck."

15:39.721 --> 15:41.679
And I wrote...

15:41.723 --> 15:43.420
Oh, wow.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.640
I never sent it.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.033
It's been in my draft
folder all these years.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.600
Why didn't you
send it?
I don't know.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.863
I remember being in line,
writing it.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.214
Oh, it was right when
I bumped into Eileen.

15:55.476 --> 15:58.653
I bent down,
picked up her stuff...

15:58.696 --> 16:00.742
and I saw something;
I know I saw something,

16:00.785 --> 16:02.352
I just can't
remember what it was.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.093
Can we go to the
coffee shop tomorrow,

16:04.137 --> 16:05.747
see if it helps?

16:05.790 --> 16:06.791
Michael, do you see
that car?

16:06.835 --> 16:09.707
It circled twice
before it parked.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.535
Okay.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.973
Isn't that suspicious?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.539
I don't think so;
he's probably just

16:15.583 --> 16:17.019
looking for a spot.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.282
Yeah, okay.
Probably right.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.849
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also suspicious?

16:20.892 --> 16:22.764
Are you on drugs?

16:22.807 --> 16:24.635
Nice to see you, too.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.942
Why is your apartment
such a mess?

16:26.986 --> 16:31.729
Because I have three
kids and no maid service.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.602
Why are you here?Jane's concerned
about you.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.560
I don't want to
talk about Jane.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.606
I'm concerned, too.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.869
So tell me what's going on.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.754
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, my God.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.105
What?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.802
Nothing.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.412
I've never seen you
wear jeans before.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.587
What's the occasion?

17:05.024 --> 17:06.851
Well, if you must know,
I have a very important event

17:06.895 --> 17:08.418
at the Truck Shop,
I'm breaking them in.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.464
You're going to
a truck shop?

17:10.507 --> 17:12.335
It's not a truck shop.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.685
It's a lesbian hotspot which you
obviously know nothing about.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.296
Oh, well.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.428
The jeans look nice.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.083
If Jane likes them,
they're wrong.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.476
Get me a new pair.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.086
Actually, let me try those on.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.522
But these are
my favorite jeans.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.568
I've had them
since high school.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.613
Perfect; so they're already
broken in. Now go take them off.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.705
I spoke to Rafael,
you can relax. I'm handling it.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.142
So there's something to handle?

17:36.185 --> 17:37.752
I need to get back to work.
So do you.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.146
I-If there's something
going on with Rafael,

17:40.189 --> 17:42.713
I-I need to know before
I let Mateo stay with him.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.455
Mateo will be fine. I also have
children with Rafael, remember?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.370
Okay-- okay.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.545
What is going on?

17:48.589 --> 17:49.720
Why are you
acting like this?

17:51.113 --> 17:53.550
Am I not giving you
enough attention again?

17:53.594 --> 17:54.812
Oh, please.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.945
I'm just looking out
for Rafael, okay?

17:56.988 --> 17:59.600
If he wanted you to know
what's going on, he'd tell you.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.863
So mind your
own business.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.909
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also getting a smackdown?

18:10.350 --> 18:13.440
Thank you, Rogelio,
for doing all of this.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.399
It's very romantic.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.098
You ain't seen nothing yet,
Mrs. De la Vega.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.624
Ah...

18:23.667 --> 18:25.408
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
This is going very well.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.671
Perhaps we should give them
a minute.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.806
I'm sorry, uh...

18:31.849 --> 18:35.462
I'm just not...
feeling it.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.681
XIOMARA:
And I haven't since chemo.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.554
I thought my sex drive
would be back by now.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.121
And mentally, I feel ready.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.123
But physically...

18:44.166 --> 18:45.602
Well, that's another story.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.952
You're most likely experiencing
chemo-induced menopause,

18:47.996 --> 18:50.607
which can affect everything
from hormone levels

18:50.651 --> 18:53.219
to your physiological
response to stimulus.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.090
Menopause?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.657
But I'm only in my 40s.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.573
It's a good thing;
the lower your estrogen levels,

18:59.616 --> 19:02.663
the lower your
chances of relapse.Okay, so when

19:02.706 --> 19:04.839
do you think my sex drive
will come back?

19:04.882 --> 19:06.493
It's different for everyone.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.277
But it will.I'm sorry.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.279
I just can't say
with any certainty.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.849
Let's just focus
on the good part.

19:14.892 --> 19:18.592
Menopause reduces the risk
of the cancer coming back.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.376
And that's all we want.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.467
The muffin was dry.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.904
Okay, good.
Do you remember anything else?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.429
No. Nothing.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.692
BARISTA:
Jane.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.084
MALE BARISTA:
Eileen.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.654
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's my fault.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.830
Let me get that.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.615
Here you go, Buttercup.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.313
Sorry. Eileen.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.272
I know why Rose gave me amnesia.LATIN LOVE NARRATOR:
I do, too!

19:46.315 --> 19:48.317
What? Why?Eileen was a stranger to me,

19:48.361 --> 19:49.710
so I didn't think
anything of it

19:49.753 --> 19:52.060
at the time, but the website
I saw on her phone,

19:52.103 --> 19:53.670
the username was "Buttercup."

19:53.714 --> 19:55.150
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Like inThe Princess Bride.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.544
No, I know, he's telling it.I don't follow.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.459
Dread Pirate Roberts
was the alias of the guy

19:59.502 --> 20:00.895
who created
the online Silk Road,

20:00.938 --> 20:02.549
which is basically
the eBay of vice.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.465
People can seek out anything
from hit men to drug dealers.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.511
Dread Pirate Roberts was
the hero in The Princess Bride

20:08.555 --> 20:10.644
and Buttercup was the heroine.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.212
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Rose always did love
a good play on words.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.475
So you think this website
is her version of the Silk Road?

20:15.518 --> 20:17.216
Username Buttercup.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.957
And the keystroke I found
must be the password.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.441
Dennis, call me.
It's important.Oh, my God.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.661
That's the car. Th-The same
one that was circling

20:27.704 --> 20:29.706
the block by my house, we are
definitely being followed.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.012
I'm sure it isn't.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.319
Think about it:
Rose almost killed you twice

20:33.362 --> 20:35.364
and now you're running around
investigating her again?

20:35.408 --> 20:36.496
You don't think
it's possible that

20:36.539 --> 20:37.845
she would send someone
after you?

20:40.848 --> 20:43.024
You're right; we
got to move. Now.

20:48.595 --> 20:52.773
I texted Dennis.
We should wait here for him.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.253
You okay?

20:54.296 --> 20:57.473
No, I'm scared.
Like I was four years ago.

20:57.517 --> 21:00.259
And mad?
Because of four years ago?

21:00.302 --> 21:03.262
God...LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa. Too much baggage.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.090
I can't believe you were still
investigating Rose back then.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.615
What did you expect me to do?
I was a cop.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.921
No, you weren't.
You'd given it up.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.359
At least that's what I thought,
I guess you were lying to me.I had to.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.752
I knew how much you hated it.
Hell, that's why I quit.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.668
No, you left because you were
unhappy on desk duty.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.888
Yeah, that definitely was a part
of it, but the bigger part was

21:20.931 --> 21:23.107
I knew how freaked out you were

21:23.151 --> 21:25.501
by me being a cop.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.460
So I stopped.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.203
You're saying I'm the reason
you gave up your career?

21:35.772 --> 21:36.643
Oh...

21:36.686 --> 21:38.645
Sorry to scare you guys.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.473
We've been keeping
a protective detail on you

21:40.516 --> 21:42.344
out of an abundance
of caution.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.867
That was my guy
you saw out there.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.521
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A heads-up would've been nice.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.523
But the good news is,
we haven't seen anything

21:47.567 --> 21:50.004
out of the ordinary.
You're safe.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.006
Oh.
Yeah.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.400
Can you just give us
a minute, please?

21:54.443 --> 21:55.444
Yeah.

21:55.488 --> 21:58.317
Thank you.

22:00.406 --> 22:04.235
So? Am I the reason
you gave up your career?

22:04.279 --> 22:06.977
Yeah.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.239
I wanted to do it for you.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.287
So what are we really trying
to hold onto?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.593
What do you mean?

22:13.636 --> 22:15.377
You weren't doing
what you loved.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.118
You were lying to me.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.815
I mean, how was that good
for either of us?

22:20.730 --> 22:22.689
I was happy.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.473
I know I was happy.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.083
But you wouldn't be now.

22:26.127 --> 22:29.130
All our memories are silly
and sappy and...

22:29.173 --> 22:31.437
What do you want me to say?
I've changed.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.321
Look, I have to go. Mateo's
been working on this project.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.367
Let's talk later.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.683
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I will
take this moment to point out

23:00.727 --> 23:04.383
one irony:
Jane hated police work...

23:07.081 --> 23:09.518
...and yet, she could never
resist playing detective.

23:15.568 --> 23:18.397
What the hell are you doing?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.790
I-I texted you
that I was coming over.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.445
Y-You forgot to send Mateo's
art project with him to school.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.621
And you thought you were gonna
find it in my medicine cabinet?

23:27.667 --> 23:29.451
I'm sorry.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.932
Look, I-I'm worried
that you're in a dark place.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.151
Whatever place I'm in
is none of your business.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.936
You lost the right to ask
about my personal life

23:35.979 --> 23:38.199
when you decided to explore
things with Michael.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.505
But it is my business
when your personal life

23:39.548 --> 23:41.289
affects our family.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.073
You've missed pickups,

23:43.117 --> 23:45.293
you're not at work.'Cause I'm not feeling well.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.469
Which, again, is none
of your business.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.601
You need to leave.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.674
Well...

24:18.718 --> 24:20.937
I'm 46 and...

Okay.

And thanks.
That's really good advice.

Shawna dump her,

30:54.940 --> 30:57.116
BOTH:
Eh!

31:03.731 --> 31:05.602
Is this hot enough for you?

31:05.646 --> 31:07.300
Oh, yeah.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.046
Oh, yes.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.918
Yes.

31:16.962 --> 31:20.052
Oh, Ro... oh...

31:20.095 --> 31:21.836
ROGELIO:
My God. Sorry.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.186
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like
Rogelio's not the only one

31:24.230 --> 31:25.492
going down the rabbit hole.

31:25.535 --> 31:29.235
I'm glad to-to see you...
helping yourself.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.847
Would you like some company?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.373
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Finally, things seem to be

31:37.417 --> 31:38.592
back on track.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.723
Let's give them another minute.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.638
Or four.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.427
Never mind.

31:47.470 --> 31:50.473
I'm sorry.
I-I'm just not ready.

31:50.517 --> 31:55.087
Don't be sorry.
I'm just confused.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.263
When I saw you strumming
your lady guitar,

31:57.306 --> 32:00.701
I assumed that meant you've-
you'd gotten your groove back.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.964
It's not that simple.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.270
Hmm.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.924
When I was by myself,

32:05.967 --> 32:10.145
I was able to finally
get out of my head a little.

32:10.189 --> 32:14.976
But with sex,
I am just not there yet.

32:15.020 --> 32:18.545
Well, what can I do to help?

32:18.588 --> 32:22.853
I think, for now,
this is something

32:22.897 --> 32:25.030
I'm gonna have to
work out on my own.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.814
Of course.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.511
Whatever you need.

32:28.555 --> 32:31.862
Joint bank accounts,
joint credit card statements.

32:31.906 --> 32:34.082
Bring it all to your interview.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.389
We'll be in touch
to schedule it.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.901
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And maybe it was

33:10.945 --> 33:12.773
the lingering effects
of their kiss,

33:12.816 --> 33:15.689
or the fact that they almost
got busted by Immigration,

33:15.732 --> 33:19.040
but in that moment, Alba knew she had to come clean

33:19.084 --> 33:21.173
to her fake husband.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.835
And, hey, thank you
for getting up there with me,

34:14.878 --> 34:17.098
and teaching my butt
the alphabet.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.362
And listen,

34:20.406 --> 34:22.277
I'm sorry. You're right.

34:22.321 --> 34:24.192
Friends support,

34:24.236 --> 34:26.107
so...

34:26.151 --> 34:29.154
whatever happens with Michael,
I'm here.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.680
Kiss already.

34:36.291 --> 34:38.119
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.512
Okay.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.253
Oh, hey-o.

34:41.296 --> 34:42.732
I only got second place,

34:42.776 --> 34:44.604
but, you know, it came
with a free pitcher of beer.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.388
Beer's not really my thing.

34:46.432 --> 34:47.824
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, whatdo you like, Leona?

34:47.868 --> 34:50.262
Okay, look.

34:50.305 --> 34:52.655
I have been nothing
but nice to you.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.483
And I get that
you think I am

34:54.527 --> 34:56.442
snobby and uptight...

34:56.485 --> 34:57.834
It's not because you're uptight.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.445
Then what is your problem?

34:59.488 --> 35:01.925
How about the fact that you
broke my best friend's heart?

35:01.969 --> 35:03.144
And ruined her career?

35:03.188 --> 35:04.972
And honestly,

35:05.015 --> 35:07.061
it's really hard to even look
at you without wondering

35:07.105 --> 35:09.977
how you're gonna hurt her next.

35:10.020 --> 35:13.763
And speaking
of broken relationships...

35:13.807 --> 35:15.809
Hey.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.854
I just wanted to apologize.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.030
I shouldn't have gone through
your things earlier today,

35:20.074 --> 35:21.293
and I'm sorry.

35:21.336 --> 35:24.600
I was just really worried.

35:24.644 --> 35:28.300
Okay. Is that it?

35:28.343 --> 35:30.345
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No, friends, it isn't.

35:30.389 --> 35:33.174
Jane wanted to tell Rafael
that she was sorry

35:33.218 --> 35:37.178
that she was the one
causing him this pain.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.267
Yeah, that's it.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.529
Okay. Look,
can you do me a favor?

35:40.573 --> 35:42.270
Of course, anything.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.837
Can you just give me some space?

35:43.880 --> 35:45.186
I'll talk to you in three days

35:45.230 --> 35:46.448
when it's your turn
to get Mateo.

35:54.282 --> 35:56.284
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, through the years,

35:56.328 --> 35:58.286
we have seen our Villanueva
women in all states,

35:58.330 --> 36:01.550
haven't we?

36:01.594 --> 36:03.161
You okay?

36:07.208 --> 36:08.775
Definitely.

36:08.818 --> 36:11.256
But we have yet
to see them all...

36:12.866 --> 36:15.956
...cry at the same time.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.087
Oh, no.
JANE:
Abuela.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.350
Are you okay?No.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.700
What? But are you okay?

36:20.743 --> 36:21.744
Jorge doesn't love her.What?

36:21.788 --> 36:25.008
JANE:
No...

36:25.052 --> 36:26.880
I'm heartbroken about Rafael
and confused about Michael.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.708
Mom? What's wrong?

36:28.751 --> 36:32.102
I don't want to have sex,
and I love having sex.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.893
Mom!
Oh, God!

36:41.329 --> 36:43.940
Man. Times
have changed.

36:43.984 --> 36:47.553
Could you imagine Ma saying
that a couple of years ago?

36:54.864 --> 36:56.866
Yeah. Me, too.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.304
Such a different person.

36:59.347 --> 37:02.220
Yeah. Me, too.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.439
Ha. You know, it's funny.

37:04.483 --> 37:07.312
I've been so focused
this whole time

37:07.355 --> 37:12.926
on how Michael has changed,
but I guess I have, too.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.884
PETRA:
I need to change, now.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.886
Just tell me what Leona said.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.758
Nothing. She and
I are different,

37:18.801 --> 37:19.976
and she was just
pointing that out.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.022
No, she needs to back off.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.285
N-No, stop. Hey.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.809
I get it. Okay?
She's your friend.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.551
She should be protective.
Friends support each other.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.118
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow.

37:31.161 --> 37:33.207
Look who's suddenly
the friendship expert.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.165
Besides, she'll come around,

37:35.209 --> 37:36.950
once she sees how I've changed.

37:36.993 --> 37:40.649
And how happy
I'm going to make you.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.959
So I was thinking...Mm-hmm?

37:46.002 --> 37:49.136
...maybe tonight
I should sleep over?

37:49.179 --> 37:50.833
Yeah?

37:50.877 --> 37:53.140
Yeah.

37:53.183 --> 37:55.185
Okay.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.544
Scary man!
He was just in our room.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.763
He ran onto the balcony!

38:17.599 --> 38:19.949
MICHAEL:
Oh, my God, I was right.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.255
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, I figured it out, too.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.474
Don't take all the credit.

38:22.517 --> 38:23.997
We're inside her network.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.433
Username Buttercup.

38:25.477 --> 38:28.697
This is it.
Rose's criminal Craigslist.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.268
DENNIS:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.879
BOBBY: Cordero led the police
to the Satin Road.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.708
But don't worry, I managed
to shut it down in time.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.275
Good.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.190
Should I take care of Cordero?

38:43.233 --> 38:48.064
If the cops are onto the Satin
Road, we've got bigger problems.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.589
We need to move up the timeline.

38:50.632 --> 38:53.331
Leave Michael alone.
He's irrelevant now.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.985
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, not to all of us.

38:56.029 --> 38:58.031
That was so close.

38:58.074 --> 39:01.034
Yeah. But it was
still a good find.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.818
We know how
she's making her money now.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.994
"We"?

39:05.038 --> 39:06.996
Well, what do you think?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.824
Would you ever
come back to the force?

39:15.309 --> 39:17.790
Which brings us here, now.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.576
I wanted to apologize,
for overreacting before.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.579
No, I didn't mean to crap
on all on our memories.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.059
You didn't.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.061
I did.

39:28.104 --> 39:31.586
A little.

39:31.630 --> 39:35.068
But I get it. It wasn't perfect.

39:35.111 --> 39:38.680
You know,
I think it actually was.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.117
Oh, your gas tank's on empty,

39:41.161 --> 39:43.816
so don't forget to fill her up
before your meeting with Chloe.

39:43.859 --> 39:46.862
Thanks. Now hurry up and go.

39:48.690 --> 39:51.040
MICHAEL: I remember
thinking how lucky I was

39:51.084 --> 39:52.694
to be married to you,

39:52.738 --> 39:56.959
which is how I felt every single
time you walked into a room.

39:57.003 --> 39:58.787
Or out of our room.

40:00.398 --> 40:05.403
It wasperfect, but
for who we were then.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.146
But we're just different now.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.932
Yeah.

40:12.975 --> 40:15.761
We really are.

40:15.804 --> 40:19.112
But what's not different
is the way I feel towards you,

40:19.155 --> 40:21.680
and sitting here,

40:21.723 --> 40:24.726
how much I just want
to hold your hand.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.347
The truth is,

40:37.391 --> 40:39.524
we'll never know what could
be as long as we're here,

40:39.567 --> 40:43.223
in Miami, surrounded
by the ghosts of our past.

40:47.836 --> 40:50.317
Come with me to Montana.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.493
What?

40:52.537 --> 40:53.712
Just for a couple days.

40:53.755 --> 40:57.280
Let's get out of here.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.195
What do you say?

41:00.849 --> 41:02.808
Let's go.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.505
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.507
She really has changed.
