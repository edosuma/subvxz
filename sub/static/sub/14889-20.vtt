and‐and talk about
something else?

13:04.518 --> 13:06.987
Sports...weather...

13:07.020 --> 13:09.189
...friendship?

13:09.222 --> 13:10.323
I know where this is going.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.959
A friendship that began
four years ago when I took in...

13:12.993 --> 13:16.096
(in unison)
’A Mypiot I hardly knew.’

13:16.129 --> 13:18.331
Cousin, come on,
every time you want something

13:18.364 --> 13:20.500
you tell that
wandering Mypiot story.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.401
It’s not going to work.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.103
I think you were right
the first time.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.171
As a judge,
I have to be fair

13:25.205 --> 13:28.909
impartial,
and completely oblivious.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.845
Okay, fine.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.446
But give me back
the bunny slippers!

13:36.049 --> 13:38.318
[instrumental music]

13:41.655 --> 13:44.124
Uh, Cousin Larry Appleton

13:44.157 --> 13:46.527
your case is next.

13:46.560 --> 13:50.263
You have been accused
of stealing office supplies.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.535
How do you please?

13:55.401 --> 13:58.371
Not guilty.

13:58.404 --> 14:02.242
Balki...and honored members
of the committee

14:02.275 --> 14:04.310
I intend to prove...

14:04.344 --> 14:07.614
...that that charge
of stealing office supplies

14:07.648 --> 14:10.984
is totally without merit.

14:11.017 --> 14:15.021
By the way, I hope you
enjoyed the fruit baskets.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.027
Miss Wiggans, would you read
the grievance, please?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.663
According to the supply
department

14:22.696 --> 14:26.232
the basement was using more
notebooks, pads and pencils

14:26.266 --> 14:28.569
than all the reporters
in the city room.

14:28.602 --> 14:29.603
Oh, I see.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.405
And because I am the only
reporter in the basement

14:32.438 --> 14:34.908
you thought that I might be
the guilty one?

14:34.941 --> 14:37.377
No, cousin, we thought
you might be the guilty one

14:37.410 --> 14:41.948
because your name is on
all the requisition slips.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.518
Appleton,
I wanna get outta here.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.521
I’m going to the Bulls game.
Why don’t you just plead guilty?

14:47.554 --> 14:50.557
Because I’m not guilty,
and I can prove it.

14:50.591 --> 14:53.894
I would like to call
my first witness to the stand.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.197
Balki Bartokomous.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.336
Well, feed me garlic
and call me stinky.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.347
Balki, would you say

15:14.380 --> 15:18.151
that you are...an honest man?

15:18.184 --> 15:21.121
Well, I’m no honest
Abe Vigoda, but I try.

15:22.689 --> 15:26.359
In fact, you are
a very honest man.

15:26.392 --> 15:30.230
Last week, when we took Jennifer
and Mary Anne to dinner...

15:30.263 --> 15:31.331
...wasn’t it you
who pointed out

15:31.364 --> 15:34.067
that the restaurant charged us
for only two dinners

15:34.100 --> 15:35.201
instead of four?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.637
No, cousin, that was you.

15:36.670 --> 15:40.607
If I remember correctly,
your exact words were

15:40.641 --> 15:43.577
"They only charged us
for two dinners

15:43.610 --> 15:46.412
"let’s get out of here."

15:48.682 --> 15:51.484
[stuttering]

15:51.518 --> 15:53.186
But‐but, Balki...

15:53.219 --> 15:55.488
...isn’t it true that you
made us go back and pay

15:55.522 --> 15:58.458
for all the dinners
because you are so honest?

15:58.491 --> 16:01.528
Well, cousin, right is right.
We did eat them.

16:01.562 --> 16:04.765
So, in a word,
Balki Bartokomous

16:04.798 --> 16:07.534
you are an exceptionally
honest man.

16:07.568 --> 16:09.503
A man incapable

16:09.536 --> 16:12.405
of committing a crime.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.608
I submit to you...

16:14.641 --> 16:17.644
...that we have here
is the most honest man

16:17.678 --> 16:18.779
at the Chronicle.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.147
Absolutely.
No argument from me.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.785
I’m not one to blow
my own nose, but...

16:24.818 --> 16:26.386
...I don’t know
if I’m the most honest.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.723
I‐I’ve been told
I’m one of the best dancers.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.226
‐Balki?
‐Yes.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.630
I now show you
this photograph.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.734
Do you recognize it?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.603
That’s me...

16:42.636 --> 16:45.672
...reading, uh,
reading a letter from mama.

16:45.706 --> 16:48.474
Do you notice anything unusual
about the photograph?

16:48.509 --> 16:51.411
‐Yes. It’s borderless.
‐Ah‐ha.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.283
But what is this object...

16:58.384 --> 17:00.754
...behind your ear?

17:00.787 --> 17:03.557
I guess that
that would be a pencil.

17:03.590 --> 17:07.127
It could be one of them pens
that looks like a pencil.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.829
‐Oh, so you’re not sure?
‐No.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.765
Well, maybe this
will help you.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.465
Thanks to
the Chronicle’s photo lab

17:13.499 --> 17:16.269
I’ve had a portion
of this picture blown up!

17:16.301 --> 17:19.105
Oh, God.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.675
Now, I ask you again,
what is this object...

17:24.778 --> 17:26.445
...behind your ear?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.548
It’s a pencil, alright.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.517
A‐ha!
But whose pencil?

17:30.551 --> 17:33.620
I guess it would be
my pencil.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.389
Oh, it would, would it?

17:36.422 --> 17:39.726
Well, maybe this will
change your mind!

17:51.304 --> 17:54.875
It‐it still looks
like my pencil.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.612
Then why does it have
the words "Chicago Chronicle"

17:58.645 --> 18:00.681
written on it?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.284
‐Well, I don’t know.
‐Oh, you don’t know?

18:04.317 --> 18:07.821
‐No, I don’t know.
‐Or you don’t want to know?

18:07.854 --> 18:08.722
No, I want to know.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.423
Well, perhaps I can
help you remember.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.558
I’d appreciate it.

18:11.592 --> 18:13.560
It was a cool,
autumn evening

18:13.594 --> 18:16.663
like many we experienced here
in the windy city.

18:16.697 --> 18:17.598
It was quitting time.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.866
You were probably
putting on your jacket

18:19.900 --> 18:21.367
getting ready to go home.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.437
Then, suddenly, you looked,
and there it was...

18:25.706 --> 18:26.907
...a pencil

18:26.940 --> 18:30.476
belonging to
the Chicago Chronicle.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.279
You put it behind your ear.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.347
‐Didn’t you?
‐Yes.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.415
‐Didn’t you?
‐Yes!

18:35.448 --> 18:36.482
And then you drove home.

18:36.517 --> 18:37.651
‐Didn’t you?
‐Yes.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.585
‐Didn’t you?
‐Yes!

18:38.619 --> 18:40.521
You probably never
gave a second thought

18:40.554 --> 18:43.189
because, after all, it was
just a pencil, wasn’t it?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.457
‐Yes.
‐Wasn’t it?

18:44.490 --> 18:46.627
Cousin, don’t!

18:46.660 --> 18:48.929
You kept it behind your ear
the entire evening.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.731
And then later,
when you found it

18:50.764 --> 18:52.298
you didn’t think about
who it belonged to

18:52.332 --> 18:53.900
or who it’s rightful owner was.

18:53.934 --> 18:56.236
After all, it was
just another pencil

18:56.269 --> 18:57.771
in the passing parade!

18:59.706 --> 19:01.207
Cousin, don’t.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.676
It wasn’t too late.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.344
You could have
returned it

19:04.377 --> 19:05.546
but you didn’t,
did you?

19:05.579 --> 19:06.647
‐No!
‐No!

19:06.680 --> 19:07.914
‐No!
‐No!

19:07.948 --> 19:10.817
You put it
in your pencil cup

19:10.851 --> 19:13.520
which is where
I found it!

19:17.223 --> 19:19.425
I didn’t mean to do it.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.197
I’m sorry!

19:28.835 --> 19:30.671
Thank you.

19:31.772 --> 19:33.907
It’s alright.
It’s over now.

19:36.810 --> 19:39.345
Lady and gentlemen
of the committee...

19:39.379 --> 19:41.314
[sobbing loudly]

19:47.387 --> 19:48.789
We have previously
established

19:48.822 --> 19:51.491
that Balki Bartokomous
is a man incapable

19:51.525 --> 19:53.226
of committing a crime.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.394
[gasping]

19:54.427 --> 19:56.697
[sobbing]

19:56.730 --> 19:57.931
We have
also established

19:57.964 --> 20:00.433
that this same
Balki Bartokomous

20:00.466 --> 20:02.936
takes home
office supplies.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.571
[whining]

20:06.973 --> 20:10.677
Therefore, taking home
office supplies is not a crime

20:10.711 --> 20:12.913
and I am not guilty!

20:14.347 --> 20:16.282
I rest my case.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.652
Good.
I can just make tip‐off.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.386
Appleton’s right.
We all do it.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.355
‐I vote not guilty.
‐Guilty.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.825
Can I change my vote?

20:24.858 --> 20:27.427
Balki, it looks like
it’s up to you.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.562
Just give me a minute.

20:28.595 --> 20:32.232
Hey, take all the time
you need, buddy.

20:35.736 --> 20:36.903
I’m ready.

20:36.937 --> 20:38.505
Guilty.

20:40.306 --> 20:43.243
[instrumental music]

20:56.623 --> 20:58.592
Are you still
mad at me?

20:58.959 --> 21:01.595
No, no.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.765
‐You did the right thing.
‐Thank you.

21:04.798 --> 21:08.334
I never realized how much
I was taking home.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.336
This stuff really adds up.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.705
Yeah.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.575
I know what you mean.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.911
I found these four paper clips
in my coat pocket.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.349
I thought I could trust me.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.788
Well, I figure
after I return this

21:27.821 --> 21:29.890
I’ll only owe
about $85.

21:29.923 --> 21:30.957
Well, I thought
it was fair

21:30.991 --> 21:33.560
you just pay
for what you used.

21:33.594 --> 21:35.328
Balki...

21:35.361 --> 21:39.032
...I’m sorry for...putting
you on the stand...

21:39.065 --> 21:40.767
...humiliating you...

21:40.801 --> 21:43.069
...making you feel
like a criminal...

21:43.103 --> 21:45.405
...stripping you
of all human dignity.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.476
You only did what any
good lawyer would do.

21:54.948 --> 21:57.951
Well, I‐I feel bad
about it, so, uh...

22:00.120 --> 22:02.322
...I got you these.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.966
Cousin, don’t...don’t
give them to me

22:12.999 --> 22:15.836
if you’re going to
take them away.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.609
M‐m‐my heart can
only be broken

22:22.643 --> 22:24.845
so many times.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.751
‐They’re yours.
‐Whee!

22:33.687 --> 22:35.622
[instrumental music]

22:41.427 --> 22:43.830
[theme music]

23:03.984 --> 23:05.919
[music continues]
