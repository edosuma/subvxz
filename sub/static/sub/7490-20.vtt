00:11.125 --> 00:13.333
Oh, hey, Kim. Check out the new pegboard.

00:13.417 --> 00:15.834
It is a great upper body workout.

00:15.917 --> 00:18.208
Oh, so that's what that thing's for.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.333
Rudy's been drying his sweaty socks on it.

00:21.458 --> 00:24.709
Oh, I knew these pegs smelled feety.

00:28.083 --> 00:31.000
So, Jack, you wanna hang out
Saturday night?

00:31.083 --> 00:32.709
Yeah, sure. What do you wanna do?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.500
Oh, I don't know. Uh...

00:35.291 --> 00:38.333
Hey, maybe we can swing
by the riverside country club

00:38.417 --> 00:40.458
for the swan's court cotillion ball
or something.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.834
Jack, are you okay?

00:44.333 --> 00:46.000
Oh, yeah.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.250
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.875
But I am not going to any ball.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.959
I hate tuxedos. I can't dance.

00:52.041 --> 00:55.458
Oh, and one more thing... I am a dude.

00:56.458 --> 00:59.166
Dudes don't do cotillions.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.250
- Hey.
-

01:01.625 --> 01:04.125
They probably don't have anything
to do this Saturday.

01:04.208 --> 01:08.417
Actually we got roped
into going to the swan's court cotillion.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.375
What? Really?

01:10.750 --> 01:12.667
You guys are going to the cotillion?

01:15.125 --> 01:17.875
My mom's making me take
her boss's dorky daughter.

01:18.583 --> 01:20.291
And I'm taking her dorkier friend.

01:20.625 --> 01:21.583
Why are you going?

01:21.667 --> 01:26.208
Oh, because Milton's giving me 60 bucks
and letting me watch his turtles go at it.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.208
Ah, Jack, glad you're up there.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.208
The old swamp foot's kicking up
something fierce.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.750
Hang this pair of socks up
to dry for me, would ya?

01:37.917 --> 01:40.500
<i>-
Ugh, they're all wet!</i>

01:41.083 --> 01:43.041
It's just a pair of socks, dude.

01:43.125 --> 01:44.333

01:50.667 --> 01:51.625

Hey, Rudy, I'm here for practice.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come in here.

02:38.709 --> 02:40.750
Dude, I didn't know
you were an Explorer Scout.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.709
So was I. Shake?

02:49.458 --> 02:51.333
I love being an Explorer Scout.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.250
This weekend is the oakwood derby
out in the mall.

02:53.917 --> 02:56.250
I was gonna do it with my dad,
but he'll be out of town.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.917
What? Dude, I'll do it with you.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.875
Really?

02:59.959 --> 03:01.166
Absolutely.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.208
Thanks, Rudy.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.792
You know, the truth is my dad's not good
with scouting stuff.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.667
He tried to teach me how to build a fire
by rubbing two sticks together.

03:08.750 --> 03:09.667
What happened?

03:09.750 --> 03:12.208
After three hours,
he threw the sticks down and said,

03:12.375 --> 03:15.375
"I'm a computer salesman,
not a dang caveman!"

03:21.542 --> 03:22.959
Frank, what do you want?

03:23.041 --> 03:25.000
We just wanted to let you know, Kim,

03:25.083 --> 03:27.083
we haven't forgotten
how you disrespected us

03:27.166 --> 03:29.000
when you walked out on the Black Dragons.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.875
You know what they say about payback.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.375
You know you just punched
your meat loaf, right?

03:43.333 --> 03:44.250
I...

03:44.375 --> 03:47.125
I think your dates for the cotillion
just walked in.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.750
Ugh, here comes the nerd herd.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.166
Hey, Milton.

03:55.375 --> 03:56.542
Hi, Jerry.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.250
Jennie.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.959
Wow. You rocking some new headgear?

04:02.041 --> 04:05.959
My dentist said I was born
with seven extra molars.

04:06.041 --> 04:09.583
And only five of them are in my mouth.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.458
Where are the other two?

04:12.542 --> 04:13.875
They're in my uvula.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.500
Hey, Milton.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.166
Oh, hi, Carrie.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.875
Those are some pretty thick glasses.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.333
Not even.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.208
My thick glasses are in my locker.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.667
These are my sexy ones.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.000
See you Saturday, guys.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.417
Can't wait to get our swan on.

04:36.417 --> 04:39.083
See you.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.917
Man, what did you get us into?

04:41.667 --> 04:42.625
Wow.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.542
There's Kim. I'll see you, guys.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.208
<i>Hey, Kim.</i>

04:49.291 --> 04:51.417
Snagged the last piece
of red velvet cake for you.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.166
Thanks. I got an apple.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.208
I know you're mad about the cotillion,

04:56.417 --> 04:59.333
but trust me, you do not want me there.
My manners are horrible.

04:59.917 --> 05:03.125
At any moment, this finger
could be in any hole in my face.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.709
Jack, believe me, I'm over the cotillion.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.375
Hey, Kim.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.125
'Sup, brochacho?

05:12.125 --> 05:14.917
I'm sorry. Who are you
and what's a brochacho?

05:15.375 --> 05:17.792
Oh, this is the guy who stepped up
and asked me to the cotillion

05:17.875 --> 05:20.000
when you, you know, didn't.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.125
Although he's been here
for just a short time,

05:22.208 --> 05:23.250
we've become very close.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.083
What's your name Again, hon?

05:25.834 --> 05:26.792
Brody.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.166
Oh, his name's Brody.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.625
Ooh, I like that.

05:30.125 --> 05:33.834
So, uh, Brody,
you're taking Kim to the cotillion?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.291
Yeah, kinda like putting on a tuxedo

05:36.375 --> 05:39.417
and dancing the night away
with my favorite lady.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.959
You've been here for three seconds.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.250
How is she your favorite lady?

05:42.792 --> 05:44.250
He said I'm his favorite lady.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.834
Let's get started on our race car.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.125
I'll read you the instructions.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.542
Instructions?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.375
We don't need any instructions.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.959
Did the Wright brothers need instructions

05:59.041 --> 06:02.291
the first time they gracefully lifted off
for their first flight?

06:02.375 --> 06:05.250
Actually, on their first flight,
they flew into the side of a barn.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.959
Maybe we'll just take a peek
at the instructions.

06:09.041 --> 06:09.875
Yeah.

06:12.625 --> 06:13.917
And don't worry,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.208
I won't let what happened to me
happen to you.

06:16.333 --> 06:19.250
- I wasn't worried--
- I was a 12-year-old boy.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.542
My dad and I had worked
on our car for weeks.

06:24.208 --> 06:25.709
I'm gonna win.

06:25.792 --> 06:30.208
And then all you guys are gonna have
to invite me to all your birthday parties,

06:30.250 --> 06:32.125
whether I have lice or not.

06:35.375 --> 06:38.208
And three, two, one, go!

06:44.792 --> 06:45.667
Oh!

06:48.041 --> 06:49.208
Way to go, Rudy.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.375
I think you may have
just fractured my skull.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.625
No badge for you.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.583
Rudy, I hate to tell you this...

07:07.417 --> 07:09.792
but since you never got
your oakwood derby badge,

07:10.250 --> 07:12.458
you never technically made Explorer Scout.

07:12.542 --> 07:15.125
What? I'm not an Explorer Scout?

07:17.375 --> 07:19.208
I've been living a lie?

07:19.834 --> 07:22.542
No, I, I have to be an Explorer Scout.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.500
I mean, I can identify any plant.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.875
I can tie over 200 knots,

07:26.959 --> 07:30.291
and I really, really enjoy
going to the bathroom in the woods.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.333
Uh, we're practicing our dancing
for the cotillion.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.875
Yeah, not in here, you're not.

07:44.959 --> 07:47.500
This is a dojo, brochacho.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.709
You ever been in a karate dojo
before, Brody?

07:52.792 --> 07:54.917
Actually, this is my first time in a dojo.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.041
-
- Hmm.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.041
Oh, it's my mom.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.792
She found me a great dress
for the cotillion.

07:58.875 --> 07:59.834
I gotta go try it on.

07:59.917 --> 08:01.166
See you tomorrow, Brody.

08:01.458 --> 08:02.291
Jack.

08:05.041 --> 08:06.917
Excuse me. I'm gonna get to work.

08:12.667 --> 08:16.000
Whoa. Wow, three boards.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.750
I don't know anything about karate,

08:17.834 --> 08:19.500
but that's pretty impressive.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.458
Yep, that's how I roll.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.500
I'm gonna go change.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.667
See you around, Jack.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.458
How about four boards?

08:50.625 --> 08:51.542
Psh.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.083
Don't know anything about karate, huh?

08:57.875 --> 08:58.917
You know that guy Brody?

08:59.583 --> 09:00.625
Well, he's a liar.

09:00.875 --> 09:03.250
He said he didn't know
anything about karate,

09:03.333 --> 09:06.917
but when he thought no one was looking,
he broke four boards.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.792
Maybe they were Jerry boards.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.959
What's a Jerry board?

09:10.041 --> 09:12.417
I pre-cut them to impress the ladies.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.375
They snap like toothpicks.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.000
Just a little trick I learned
from poser magazine.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.750
There's just something
I don't trust about this guy.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.458

Uh, I didn't send you Any flowers.

09:31.792 --> 09:32.667
I know.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.333
I sent them to myself
and then signed your name.

The chocolates are delicious.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.959
I paid for that candy.
I'm getting a piece of it.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.834
So, Kim has no idea that we asked you
to take her to the cotrillion.

10:06.917 --> 10:10.000
Nope, that's not it.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.834
- Cotillion?
- That's it.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.917
Kim doesn't know a thing.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.667
I've done everything
that you've asked me to do.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.750
So my initiation should be over.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.500
I wanna be a Black Dragon.

10:21.583 --> 10:25.875
You'll be a Black Dragon
after the cotillion.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.291
Yes!

You gotta stop punching your food.

So this is about you
becoming an official Explorer Scout?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.083
It certainly is.

11:17.166 --> 11:20.583
This car is hand-milled
with sport suspension,

11:20.667 --> 11:23.500
and really, really cool spinny rims.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.333

12:07.542 --> 12:09.542
Hi, guys. Sorry we're late.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.583
I think those hot girls are our dates.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.208
Jennie? Carrie?

12:19.709 --> 12:20.834
Wait, what happened to the--

12:21.417 --> 12:22.667
And your...

12:23.792 --> 12:26.000
And the whole...

12:28.667 --> 12:30.583
I think we should find our table.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
- Oh, okay.
- Oh.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.041
- Let's go?
- Oh!

12:42.959 --> 12:45.875
- Brody, I'm having the best time.
- I am, too.

12:45.959 --> 12:47.500
And it's going to get even better.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.083
Somebody nominated us
for King and Queen of the Swan Court.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.625
That's crazy.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.917
But there's a lot of Black Dragons here

12:55.000 --> 12:56.625
and I don't think
they're gonna vote for me.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.291
I don't know. I think we got a shot.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.583
Oh, yeah, this is my jam.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.458
I'm freaking out!

13:21.959 --> 13:24.208
We're with the two prettiest girls
at the dance.

13:24.709 --> 13:26.583
That's against the laws of nature.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.917
Like the platypus.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.750
<i>Black dragons in the bathroom, now!</i>

13:37.333 --> 13:38.375
All right.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.000
Everyone knows what's going down
with Kim, right?

13:41.375 --> 13:42.291
I don't.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.417
You know,
Kim's actually a pretty cool girl.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.875
Who's gonna be sorry that
she walked out on us.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.208
Wait a minute!

13:50.667 --> 13:51.875
You guys see that?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.375
Hey, who's in there.

13:55.458 --> 13:59.834
Uh, just two dudes
trying to conserve water.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.333
Saving the planet, one potty at a time.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.000
Respect.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.375
Wait.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.083
You two! Lock them in the storage closet.

14:12.166 --> 14:13.959
- Oh, man.
- What are you gonna do to Kim?

14:14.041 --> 14:15.291
Don't worry about Kim.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.458
Oh, no, man, you can't do this.
Have a heart.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.458
Our dates are smokin'!

14:26.625 --> 14:28.458
Tonight, I put an end to the lie

14:28.542 --> 14:31.041
that I've lived for the last 15 years.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.125
We all know you dye your hair, Rudy.

14:34.542 --> 14:35.583
Not that lie.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.375
I'm talking about
a completely different lie.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.625
Hey, who'd Kim end up
taking to the cotillion anyway?

14:41.041 --> 14:42.917
This new kid Brody Carlson.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.875
Brody?

14:44.375 --> 14:45.500
He's a first-degree black belt.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.500
I tried to recruit him,

14:46.583 --> 14:48.709
but he was dead set
on being a Black Dragon.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.333
Brody's a Black Dragon?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.166
Oh, I knew there was something off
about that guy.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.750
What... I gotta get to the cotillion.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.750
- Oh, man, I need a tux.
- Oh, no, I got one in the office.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.041
I got it to convince a girl
that I was a Vegas magician.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.458
Again, more lies.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.250
All right, cars to the starting line.

15:12.834 --> 15:17.125
In order to get your badge,
your car must cross the finish line.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.000
Ready, set, go!

15:34.333 --> 15:36.250
Aw, sorry, Eddie.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.083
Everyone crossed but you.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.166
Eddie, wait.

15:42.625 --> 15:43.792
I want you to have this.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.667
Rudy, if you put your car
down on the track,

15:45.750 --> 15:46.959
you'll be disqualified.

15:47.041 --> 15:47.959
I don't care.

15:48.417 --> 15:49.542
Look, there's no rule that says

15:49.625 --> 15:51.792
one car can't push the other one
across the finish line.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.500
And, Eddie, you're gonna earn your badge.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.083
-
- Yes!

16:12.125 --> 16:14.583
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yes! Yeah!

16:14.667 --> 16:15.750
Good job.

16:16.083 --> 16:19.792
Wow. It wasn't pretty,
but here's your badge, Eddie.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.208
- Thank you.
-

16:21.959 --> 16:25.834
Rudy, I got my badge,
but you're not going to get yours.

16:25.917 --> 16:28.583
Ah. I think I owe you an apology.

16:28.667 --> 16:31.709
I was so hung up on the badge that
I forgot what being a scout's all about.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.709
Just helping each other, man.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.208
For a guy who's not really
an Explorer Scout,

16:36.458 --> 16:38.333
you're the best Explorer Scout
I've ever met.

16:44.542 --> 16:48.917
This year's King and Queen
of the Swan's Court are...

16:51.083 --> 16:52.750
Brody and Kim.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.208
I can't believe it!

17:00.709 --> 17:03.500
Jack, the Black Dragons are here
to get revenge on Kim.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.333
I know. I'm just trying to figure out how.

17:05.417 --> 17:06.917
Dude, they locked us in the closet.

17:07.333 --> 17:11.917
And now, for the presentation
of the crowns by our grand swan.

17:19.417 --> 17:22.458
I hope you like mushroom gravy, Kim.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.208
It's the swan!

17:35.417 --> 17:37.458
What just happened?

17:37.792 --> 17:40.542
Kim, Brody's a Black Dragon.
He set you up.

17:41.166 --> 17:44.083
- What?
- No. Kim, I had no idea. I...

17:44.166 --> 17:45.125
What?

17:48.625 --> 17:51.250
Oh, you look horrible.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.458
Looks like we've got you outnumbered
six to two.

18:03.125 --> 18:03.959
Three.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.208
Four.

18:08.959 --> 18:09.750
Five.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.750
You just made a big mistake.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.333
Looks like the Black Dragons messed
with the wrong Swan Queen.

19:07.542 --> 19:10.000
Guys, I'm sorry.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.041
I guess I was kind of a jerk, huh?

19:12.125 --> 19:13.875
Yeah, you kinda were.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.458
But you did come through in the end.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.291
Look at me.

19:21.959 --> 19:22.917
I'm a mess.

19:23.750 --> 19:24.834
I don't know...

19:25.333 --> 19:26.792
I think brown's a good color on you.

19:29.041 --> 19:29.959
Give me that.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.208
Kim, I'm sorry.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.417
None of this would have happened
if I had said yes

19:36.500 --> 19:37.834
when you asked me to go with you.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.917
Well, you're here now.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.333
I just got one question.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.333
Where did you get that tux?

19:45.417 --> 19:48.041
Oh, Rudy lent it to me. I don't know...

19:48.166 --> 19:49.250
I kinda like it. Whoo.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.500
Where did those flowers just come from?

19:54.583 --> 19:55.750
I have no idea.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.000
Well...

20:02.834 --> 20:04.583
Brody won't be needing this anymore.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.583
Here's something
I never thought I'd say...

20:10.041 --> 20:11.083
You wanna dance?

20:12.208 --> 20:13.542
- Sure.
<i>-</i>

20:19.625 --> 20:21.709
Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

20:23.000 --> 20:24.917
Finally, something I can move to.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.083
Now, this is my jam.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.792
Whatever. You're the queen.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.166
Dude, the girls saw us
kick Black Dragon butt.

20:42.583 --> 20:43.667
They think we're awesome.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.291
You know what this means?

20:45.792 --> 20:48.709
We got hot girlfriends.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.875
Swag! Up top!

20:52.709 --> 20:53.750
Oh...

20:54.083 --> 20:56.083
They sure have been in the bathroom
for a while.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.250
Hey, guys.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.125
What happened?

21:08.250 --> 21:10.917
It feels so good
to get out of those stuffy gowns.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.625
Oh, I feel so much better in my headgear.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.542
I could literally feel
my molars misaligning.

21:17.083 --> 21:20.333
And those contacts were killing me.

21:20.959 --> 21:22.959
I like having the old windshields back.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.917
So, you wanna hang out?

21:29.083 --> 21:30.375
- I guess.
- Whatever.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.250
