01:17.243 --> 01:20.413
I mean, what's down? A-hah-hyuck.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.999
P.J.'s spending the weekend
at his grandma's,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.960
so I'm taking chainsaw
to the park to play frisbee.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.962
Gonna take Waffles, too?

01:28.046 --> 01:31.174
Waffles? No way, Dad.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.468
Cats are no fun. All they do is sit there.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.011

01:35.929 --> 01:39.432
Oh, a perfect Sunday afternoon.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.059
Wife's out shopping,

01:41.142 --> 01:43.228
kids are off kiddin' around...

01:43.311 --> 01:45.855
And it's kickoff time.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.442
And here's the kickoff.
It's up, and it's a long--

01:49.526 --> 01:52.445
We interrupt the football game
to bring you some bad news.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.281
I thought that was the bad news.

01:55.365 --> 01:59.452
Horace the cat, beloved star of cat food
commercials, is dead.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.122
Good riddance. Cats-- Who needs 'em?

02:02.205 --> 02:04.916
Horace, shown here doing
his famous Can-can

02:05.000 --> 02:06.710
in a chock full of mackerel commercial,

02:06.793 --> 02:08.086
will be sorely missed.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.713
Not by me.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.756
I'm standing here with admiral carp,

02:11.840 --> 02:13.925
owner of chock full of mackerel cat food.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.135
Sir, your reaction?

02:15.218 --> 02:16.386
Oh, oh, I am heartbroken.

02:16.469 --> 02:22.100
Horace was one of a kind, totally unique.

02:22.183 --> 02:25.103
Auditions for his replacement are at noon.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.355
-Replacement?
-Yes.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.774
And the fortunate feline
that replaces Horace

02:29.858 --> 02:31.651
will be one rich kitty.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.319
Yeah, right.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.031
No such thing as-- rich?

02:36.197 --> 02:38.700
[male reporter] I'm sure we'll all miss
that little plump, orange rascal.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.119
Ahem, anyway, back to some football, huh?

02:41.202 --> 02:43.538
All right, it's 3rd and 4th at the 25...

02:43.621 --> 02:46.291
Orange and plump, eh?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.919

[purring]

02:52.339 --> 02:55.133
Ooh, especially wittle Waffles.

02:55.216 --> 02:59.596
Gonna make Uncle Pete rich,
ain'tcha, honey bunny?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.639
Hiya, Petey.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.600
Oh, uh, Goof.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.477
Glad I ran into ya.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.438
I was inspecting yer cat here.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.524
Don't look good. Tsk tsk tsk.

03:11.608 --> 03:15.236
Well, look at that tail.
See how bushy it is?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.446
Gawrsh!

03:16.529 --> 03:18.198
And his eyes--

03:18.281 --> 03:20.116
Notice how bright they are?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.701
They are bright.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.245
Brighty-eyed and bushy-tailed.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.122
Very bad sign, Goof.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.375
I'd get him to the vet if I was you.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.126
If you were me,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.003
you'd be in the middle of house painting.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.923
But if Waffles is sick, it can wait.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.216
Relax, Goof.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.093
Your old buddy Pete's gonna take him

03:38.176 --> 03:39.678
to the vet for you.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.222
Pete, you're not just a buddy,

03:42.305 --> 03:43.848
You're a pal!

03:43.932 --> 03:45.350
Yeah. Ha ha.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.186
You're not just a Goof, you're an idjut.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.229

[buzzer]

04:03.576 --> 04:05.870
Not even close.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.455
Forget it.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.040
No.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.876
Yes!

04:11.960 --> 04:13.294
He's perfect.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.671
The new Horace.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.007
Ah, yes, my boy,

04:17.090 --> 04:19.300
you're going to be a star.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.469
Now how much am I going to make

04:21.553 --> 04:23.930
off this cat food biz?

04:24.014 --> 04:25.432
Well, let's see.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.477
A national campaign,
billboards, radio, TV.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.355
I'd say your cut would be about...

04:32.981 --> 04:36.192
200,000 big ones.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.196
T-t-two hundred thou-- two hundred thou--

04:40.280 --> 04:42.032
I love that neighborhood!

04:42.115 --> 04:44.075
I want to move in as soon as possible.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.327
Now let go of me.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.621
You'll get paid as soon as I check out

04:48.705 --> 04:50.832
waffles' home environment.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.834
H-h-home environment?

04:52.917 --> 04:55.670
Why, certainly. I have to make sure

04:55.754 --> 04:59.341
my new star is a pampered kitty.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.927
He is a pampered kitty, isn't he?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.596
Oh, sure.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.057
We pamp him up all the time. [laughs]

05:12.354 --> 05:14.064
[meow-w-w]

05:15.357 --> 05:16.649
Gawrsh, Pete,

05:16.733 --> 05:18.568
Waffles looks terrible...

05:18.651 --> 05:22.655
And orange and awful and orange.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.409
Oh, yeah. It's bad news, Goof.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.412
The vet says Waffles
can't live with you anymore.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.247
He's allergic.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.709
Oh, no! Allergic to what?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.878
Well, to your house.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.923
But...since when?

05:40.006 --> 05:43.802
Well, uh, since you painted it yellow.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.513
He's got pigmentosa
selio-scleosis, you know.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.139
You don't say.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.476
I do say, but don't
expect me to say it again.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.062
Hey, I know. I'll paint the house green.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.815
Ooh-- Green's even worse.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.026
Not as bad as red, of course, or purple.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.319
What about vermilion?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.947
Ohh! Don't ask.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.700
Waffles is allergic to every color

06:06.783 --> 06:08.827
except chartreuse, of course.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.705
And who wants to live in
a chartreuse house?

06:11.788 --> 06:12.831
[crash]

06:13.581 --> 06:15.959
Goof, I want you to know

06:16.042 --> 06:19.045
that Waffles doesn't
have to go with strangers.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.381
He can live with me.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.716
[sniff]

06:22.799 --> 06:24.217
Gawrsh, Pete.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.886
I don't deserve a pal like you.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.931
No, you don't, but here. Sign this.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.225
Okey-doke. What am I signing?

06:32.308 --> 06:34.352
This just says that I own Waffles--

06:34.436 --> 06:37.522
I mean that I'm temporarily
taking care of him.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.192
That man is a saint.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.904
Hey, Dad, how come Mr. Pete
is taking Waffles?

06:44.988 --> 06:49.284
[sniff] Because Waffles
is allergic to us, Maxie,

06:49.367 --> 06:51.786
And it's all my fault

06:51.870 --> 06:54.205
for painting the house yellow.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.458
[sobbing]

06:58.835 --> 07:00.295
[smacking]

07:00.378 --> 07:04.174
Will you quit that, you hairy woodpecker?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.800
[meow]

07:12.557 --> 07:13.600
[sniffing]

07:13.683 --> 07:16.895
Petey, that cat smells.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.938
Well, of course he does, Peg-ums.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.441
If you picked through trash cans all day,

07:21.524 --> 07:24.819
You'd smell, too. Ha ha ha!

07:24.903 --> 07:27.238
Heh heh. That's funny, Daddy.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.823
Ha ha ha ha.

07:28.907 --> 07:33.161
Yes, Daddy is a very funny man, Pistol.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.080
Now give Waffles a bath!

07:35.163 --> 07:36.164
A bath?

07:36.247 --> 07:37.707
A bath?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.918
[yowling]

07:43.880 --> 07:45.715
Dad, none of these cat books

07:45.799 --> 07:47.717
say anything about Waffles' condition.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.219
Never mind that, Maxie.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.764
All we got to do is paint the house
chartreuse.

07:52.847 --> 07:56.518
Okay, but I think
there's something fishy going on.

07:56.601 --> 08:00.146
Oh, calm down, you fuzzy porcupine.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.107
I don't like this any more than you do.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.692
[yowling]

08:05.527 --> 08:07.529
Ahh.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.699
Oh, now, isn't that nice?

08:10.782 --> 08:13.702
Waffles loves his bath, doesn't he?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.120
How cute.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.123
He wants you to scrub his back, Petey.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.667
I'll scrub it with a can opener,

08:20.750 --> 08:22.502
mangy little flea bucket.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.547
All good folks paint with even strokes.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.465
All good folks--

08:27.549 --> 08:28.675
Dad, hold it!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.723
What's the matter, Maxie?

08:34.806 --> 08:37.308
Waffles can't be allergic
to the color of our house.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.769
It says here that cats are color-blind.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.480
Gawrsh, Maxie.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.691
Maybe Waffles hadn't read that book.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.859
Dad...

08:45.942 --> 08:49.279
Or maybe Pete is up to something.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.072
[Peg] after you rinse the shampoo out,

08:51.156 --> 08:53.241
make sure to use the conditioner.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.035
But, Peg-ums,

08:55.118 --> 08:57.328
my fingers are turning to prunes.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.997
Daddy, Daddy, there's
a big man at the door!

08:59.080 --> 09:01.708
I know I'm not supposed
to let in a stranger,

09:01.791 --> 09:03.293
but I saw him through the peephole,

09:03.376 --> 09:04.544
and he's got a funny mustache,

09:04.627 --> 09:05.879
and his name is Admiral Carp.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.048
Who's Admiral Carp, Petey?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.633
Well, he's, uh, just a guy

09:10.717 --> 09:13.470
interested in buying a used RV.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.097
But, Daddy, he said
he was here about the cat.

09:16.181 --> 09:20.268
No, no, honey. Not cat. Uh, caddie.

09:20.352 --> 09:25.148
Yeah. There's this converted '73 cadillac
we just got in.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.483
-[doorbell rings]
-Real honey of an RV.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.984
Oh, yeah.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.653
That big lug nut is up to something.

09:30.737 --> 09:35.158
So Mr. Pete, how is
our little beauty today?

09:35.241 --> 09:36.910
Fine, Carp. I'm just fine.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.079
I was talking about Waffles.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.413
Oh, shh.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.916
I mean, sure you were. I knew that.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.502
Why, he's upstairs. Just had a bath.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.506
And a wax and polish!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.883
He's shining like new, yes, sir!

09:51.966 --> 09:52.926
Excellent.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.220
Has he been out running today?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.472
Oh, yeah. You betcha.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.224
And he's in top shape.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.018
Purrs like a kitten. Ha ha!

10:02.102 --> 10:03.603
Well, I should hope.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.356
Yes, sir. Grips the road like a champ

10:06.439 --> 10:07.607
and do you know why?

10:07.691 --> 10:09.943
Because he's got four on the floor!

10:10.026 --> 10:11.945
Where else would they be?

10:12.028 --> 10:14.989
[Goofy] Pete, we need to talk.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.366
About--

10:18.326 --> 10:19.953
Lousy door-to-door salesmen.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.955
They never let up for a minute.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.456
This can't wait, Pete.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.920
Fine. Wait in there. Be right with you.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.296
Ha ha ha.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.048
Wasn't a salesman after all,

10:32.132 --> 10:33.675
just my goof-head neighbor.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.511
[Goofy] we need to talk about Waffles.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.807
What has this individual
got to do with Waffles?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.810
Well, now, he means Belgian waffles.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.480
I got a recipe
he's been wanting to borrow.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.649
It's a little hobby called cooking.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.485
Uh, back in a sec, Carpie.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.238
You okay, Pete? You seem a little jumpy.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.240
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.366
It's that guy out there.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.993
He's a... tax collector.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.413
Pete, an honest man has nothing to fear.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.622
What's that got--

11:04.706 --> 11:05.790
Right. Good one.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.125
[rip]

11:07.208 --> 11:09.210
Now, about Waffles...

11:09.294 --> 11:10.920
Oh-oh...

11:11.004 --> 11:13.590
Hold that thought, Goof.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.509
You know, before your husband came along,

11:16.593 --> 11:18.928
I thought Horace was irreplaceable.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.639
Oh? And who is Horace?

11:21.723 --> 11:23.099
Peg!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.477
Horace was the name

11:25.560 --> 11:27.562
of his old station wagon. Yeah.

11:27.645 --> 11:31.024
Don't bring it up again.
He gets too emotional.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.526
All right, Petey. If you say so.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.611
[Goofy] Pete!

11:34.694 --> 11:35.779
Oh...

11:37.155 --> 11:38.740
Okay, Goof, spill it out quick.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.075
What is it you want?

11:40.158 --> 11:42.660
Well, Max and I think

11:42.744 --> 11:45.580
that maybe Waffles isn't
allergic to our house

11:45.663 --> 11:47.415
And maybe you're up to something.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.627
Me? Up to something?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.045
Like what?

11:52.128 --> 11:55.548
Well, like, uh...

11:55.632 --> 11:56.800
Maybe...

11:56.883 --> 11:58.968
Gawrsh. I don't know.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.513
You don't know?

12:01.596 --> 12:05.767
I take your cat in
as an act of friendship,

12:05.850 --> 12:08.687
then you turn around and accuse me

12:08.770 --> 12:10.855
of trying to pull a fast one.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.025
I've never been so hurt in my life.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.569
Forgive me, Pete.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.030
I don't know what I was thinking.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.032
Boo-hoo-hoo!

12:21.116 --> 12:22.617
Yeah, yeah, I know.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.619
I didn't even know you could think, Goof.

12:24.703 --> 12:28.373
It's all right. That's fine. Good enough!

12:28.456 --> 12:30.875
I'm convinced! Okay?

12:30.959 --> 12:33.837
You're getting water stains
all over my shoes.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.339
Whew. One down, one to go.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.967
I'm real glad you
stopped by there, Carpie!

12:39.050 --> 12:40.719
Ah, yes. I am, too.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.055
Gave me a chance to see
Waffles' home environment.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.641
And I am pleased to say that I--

12:48.184 --> 12:51.563
A canine. Oh, dear. Very bad.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.064
I do not approve

12:53.148 --> 12:56.276
of dogs and cats living
together or cohabitating.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.278
I don't even know what that is.

12:58.361 --> 13:01.448
Sorry, Pete, but I'm afraid
our deal is off.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.616
But wait! This ain't my dog!

13:03.700 --> 13:05.035
It's, uh--why...

13:05.118 --> 13:06.703
It's Goofy's!

13:06.786 --> 13:09.122
Here, Goof! Chainsaw's your dog!

13:09.205 --> 13:11.875
He is? Gawrsh, thanks, Pete.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.544
By the way, I know what's goin' on here,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.755
And I just got one thing to say.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.089
[gulp]

13:18.173 --> 13:22.093
This is the most honest man I know.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.763
He always pays his taxes.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.974
Thank you for that scintillating bit
of information.

13:28.058 --> 13:31.644
Well, so long, fellas!
Thanks for stoppin' by!

13:34.481 --> 13:39.319
Strange. Waffles seemed a lot more
orange yesterday.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.904
You want orange?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.155
[spray paint can rattling]

13:42.238 --> 13:44.991
[spraying]

13:45.075 --> 13:46.159
[coughing]

13:46.242 --> 13:47.410
[Pete] There!

13:47.494 --> 13:50.205
Ah! Excellent!

13:50.288 --> 13:53.667
He can do the Horace Can-can, can he not?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.377
Why, sure, sure.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.922
This cat can Can-can like a champ--chump.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.007
See you bright and early.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.469
Make sure my star gets
a good night's sleep.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.722
You know, Max, we was wrong about Pete.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.016
And here is Admiral Carp

14:10.100 --> 14:12.227
with his latest discovery--Waffles.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.104
Uh, D-d-dad,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.690
I really think you should see this.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.484
We should never have accused
him of doing something wrong.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.862
Dad! Don't you see who that is?

14:22.946 --> 14:25.490
[gasp] I don't believe it!

14:25.573 --> 14:27.742
It's Pete's tax collector!

14:27.826 --> 14:31.287
Dad! Wake up and smell the larceny!

14:31.371 --> 14:34.040
The lucky Waffles is shown here

14:34.124 --> 14:35.500
With his owner Pete.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.584
Pete?

14:36.668 --> 14:38.128
Gawrsh, Maxie.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.839
I don't know how to tell you this,

14:40.922 --> 14:44.509
But I think Pete stole your cat.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.725
All right, Pete, give him back!

14:55.770 --> 14:59.733
Oh, but, Peg-ums, it ain't that simple.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.443
It's like this--

15:01.526 --> 15:03.903
Daddy, did you really steal Maxie's cat?

15:03.987 --> 15:06.239
Well, stealin' is such a...

15:06.322 --> 15:09.951
A harsh word, Pistol, honey.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.162
Well, that's just what you did!

15:12.245 --> 15:13.663
Well, guess what.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.665
You signed a written contract

15:15.749 --> 15:17.876
Saying Waffles belongs to me!

15:17.959 --> 15:19.002
Dad!

15:19.085 --> 15:21.629
Aw, who reads the small print?

15:21.713 --> 15:24.382
Anyhow, I got a verbal
contract with Waffles

15:24.466 --> 15:25.884
sayin' he's Max's!

15:25.967 --> 15:27.635
Ha! Your verbal contract

15:27.719 --> 15:29.095
ain't worth the paper it's written on.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.221
Is too!

15:30.305 --> 15:31.222
Says who?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.432
Says me!

15:32.515 --> 15:33.683
What you gonna do about it?

15:33.767 --> 15:34.809
[Peg] Hold it, Pete.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.605
Hold it. Hold it! Hold it!

15:38.688 --> 15:40.440
Why don't we just ask Waffles

15:40.523 --> 15:42.275
who he wants to live with?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.236
Whatever you think is fair, Peg-ums.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.072
How's that idea grab you, Goof?

15:47.155 --> 15:48.573
Grabs me fine.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.949
Come on, boy.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.577
You want to be with me, don't you?

15:52.660 --> 15:56.122
It's up to you. Spend your life as a Goof

15:56.206 --> 16:00.085
or a rich and famous TV star.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.712
There you have it! He chose me!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.049
Bye, Waffles.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.469
Hey, don't feel so bad, you Goofs.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.430
I gave you chainsaw, didn't i?

16:12.514 --> 16:13.932
You what?

16:14.015 --> 16:17.102
I've seen you pull some stunts, Pete,

16:17.185 --> 16:19.479
but this is the pits!

16:19.562 --> 16:23.441
But, sweetums, Waffles
chose me fair and square.

16:23.525 --> 16:27.487
Well, I hope you and Waffles
are very happy together

16:27.570 --> 16:29.864
spending the night in the garage!

16:29.948 --> 16:33.201
Oh, but, cinnamon apple--

16:33.284 --> 16:35.870
[meow]

16:35.954 --> 16:38.957
Oh, quit starin' at me,
you miserable waste of fur!

16:39.040 --> 16:40.041
I'm thinkin'!

16:40.125 --> 16:42.544

16:42.627 --> 16:44.212
["Can-can" playing]

16:52.262 --> 16:53.847
No.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.976
If I can Can-can, you can Can-can!

16:58.977 --> 17:00.311
Hey!

17:12.407 --> 17:14.576
[Goofy] don't you fret none, Max.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.703
We're not givin' up without a fight!

17:16.786 --> 17:18.413
Waffles made his decision.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.582
He'd rather be with Mr. P.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.459
That's why we got to make Waffles

17:22.542 --> 17:24.252
remember the good times.

17:24.336 --> 17:25.170
How?

17:25.295 --> 17:27.172
[crash]

17:27.297 --> 17:30.175

17:30.258 --> 17:34.846
[Pete] Well, it ain't so bad
havin' no one to talk to.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.181
[muttering]

17:36.264 --> 17:40.268
I got 250,000 big ones comin'!

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
Hey, you, why aren't you eatin'?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.939
Your contract says
you're supposed to be chubby!

17:45.065 --> 17:47.567
[meow]

17:47.650 --> 17:50.153
What? Now you want to be fed?

17:51.905 --> 17:55.700
Ooh, you dirty rotten
loud little bag of hair.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.703
I'll make a pair of gloves out of you.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.998
Now take teeny, tiny bites.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.501
Make sure you don't choke now.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.919
[crash]

18:06.002 --> 18:08.546
What's that big Goof up to now?

18:11.299 --> 18:14.094
[Goofy] hey, uh, Maxie, you remember this?

18:14.219 --> 18:17.806
It's the time we took
Waffles to the fish market

18:17.931 --> 18:20.100
on all-you-can-eat day!

18:20.183 --> 18:22.310
Brings back some memories, huh?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.561
[meow]

18:23.687 --> 18:25.438
And here's the time

18:25.563 --> 18:29.401
you and Waffles made
a sand castle out of me!

18:29.484 --> 18:33.613
I sure wish Waffles was back home

18:33.697 --> 18:35.490
where he belongs!

18:35.573 --> 18:38.034
[Max] yeah. Me, too.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.829
What do you say, boy?
You want to come home?

18:40.912 --> 18:43.373

18:46.251 --> 18:49.129
[Pete] Hey. Steak and lobster, Waffles.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.882
Come inside. Plenty more
where that came from.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.052
Better luck next time, ya Goofs!

18:57.387 --> 18:59.431

Yeah?

19:00.682 --> 19:02.600

19:02.684 --> 19:04.477
We need to get Waffles'
cat food commercial

19:04.561 --> 19:06.021
In the can, so to speak.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.356
The sooner we do, the sooner you get paid.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.860
Uh, you're talkin' my language, Carpie!

19:11.985 --> 19:15.113
Excellent. We'll film him
doing the Can-can

19:15.238 --> 19:16.364
Right on your front lawn.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.868
Can-can? When-when? Not tomorrow!

19:19.993 --> 19:21.661
No, don't be silly.

19:21.745 --> 19:22.996
Whew.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.289
We're doing it tonight.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.166
Tonight?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.878
Let's go, Pete.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.171
Center! It's showtime!

19:31.296 --> 19:33.757
Isn't this exciting, Maxie?

19:33.882 --> 19:37.093
They're making a genuiney
television commercial!

19:37.218 --> 19:39.012
Yeah, with my cat.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.974

19:43.058 --> 19:44.184
[meow]

19:44.267 --> 19:46.144
Carpie, I don't think

19:46.227 --> 19:48.396
Waffles is up to doing
the Can-can tonight.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.149
Well, he better be.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.359
No Can-can from him,

19:52.442 --> 19:55.320
No 200,000 big ones for you.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.030
Action!

19:57.113 --> 19:59.199
The poor cat's bunions
have been acting up,

19:59.282 --> 20:01.076
And his dogs have been barking up, and--

20:01.159 --> 20:03.703
What? He's doing it.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.663
[jazzy version
of Offenbach's "Can-can" playing]

20:10.418 --> 20:12.504
Carpie, he's doin' it!

20:12.587 --> 20:15.048
Well, of course he is, you ninny.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.843
Okay, Waffles, now go to
the bowl of chockful of mackerel

20:18.927 --> 20:19.886
And eat it.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.347
And...action.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.683
[sniff sniff]

20:24.766 --> 20:26.476
Yuck. Ecch.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.937
Why isn't he eating it?

20:29.020 --> 20:31.398
Well, he's just stuffed

20:31.481 --> 20:33.692
From havin' a big din-din, that's all.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.736
Waffles, just take a bite.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.739
Just a teeny bite for the commercial.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.409
No way. Yuck! Pee-yew!

20:42.492 --> 20:44.953
No, no, no. It's not pee-yew.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.871
It's delicious. Look.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.917
Yummy, yummy. Oh, goodie, goodie.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.461
What have you been feeding this
cat, Peter?

20:53.545 --> 20:55.338
Steak! Lobster! Caviar!

20:55.422 --> 20:57.465
I've got the food bills to prove it!

20:57.590 --> 21:00.260
I've been hoodwinked! You ruined him!

21:00.343 --> 21:02.012
How do you expect a cat

21:02.095 --> 21:04.347
to go back to eating mackerel by-products

21:04.472 --> 21:07.392
after tasting steak and lobster?

21:07.475 --> 21:09.436
Uh, chainsaw likes it!

21:09.561 --> 21:10.812
What did you say?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.691
A dog eating chockful of mackerel?

21:14.816 --> 21:18.945
Ah, yes--the cat food so delicious,

21:19.029 --> 21:21.072
even dogs love it.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.283
Waffles is out. Chainsaw's in!

21:23.366 --> 21:25.326
I'd like to get him
under contract immediately.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.996
But chainsaw's my girl.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.957
No, he isn't. You gave him
to Maxie, remember?

21:31.041 --> 21:32.500
The rotten, no-good--

21:32.625 --> 21:36.046
All right, Carp. Waffles did the Can-can,

21:36.129 --> 21:38.256
So you still owe me!

21:38.381 --> 21:40.508
Why, you're quite right, my dear fellow.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.260
A deal is a deal.

21:42.385 --> 21:46.264
There's your 200,000 big ones now.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.433
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

21:48.516 --> 21:51.186
Let me have it!

21:51.269 --> 21:54.773
Hey, hey! Wait a minute!

21:56.232 --> 21:57.942
This is kitty litter!

21:58.026 --> 21:59.694
Of course. What did you think

21:59.778 --> 22:02.238
You're getting paid in, dollars?

22:02.364 --> 22:04.866
Waffles, if you come home,

22:04.949 --> 22:07.202
I'll never say cats aren't any fun again.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.537
What do you say? Forgive me?

22:10.789 --> 22:12.540

22:13.750 --> 22:16.086
You want to play frisbee?

22:16.169 --> 22:17.671
Uh-huh.
