00:23.857 --> 00:25.530
Man:
Are you ( bleep ) kidding me?

00:45.345 --> 00:47.347
Girl: Whoever named
this town "Downers Grove"

00:47.514 --> 00:49.084
had a sick sense of humor.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.900
The suburbs are the ghettos
of the meaningless...

01:04.498 --> 01:06.409
...unless your town
has its very own curse,

01:06.567 --> 01:09.741
where a senior dies each year
the week before graduation.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.355
Now that suddenly gives
your town instant meaning.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.041
( Radio static)

01:44.204 --> 01:45.478
Announcer:
You asked for it and more!

01:45.639 --> 01:46.982
Announcer #2:
102.3.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.586
Man: A beautiful
sunny day here in Illinois,

01:49.743 --> 01:52.121
a whopping 88 degrees.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.122
Summer around the bend.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.318
Got a big shout out
to all our seniors

01:56.483 --> 01:58.156
at Downers Grove High School.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.322
One week to graduation.
Make it count.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.594
Don't get caught up in the curse.
Ha ha!

02:04.758 --> 02:06.669
We're gonna keep playing
all the hits.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.396
Announcer:
Your hit music channel.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.166
Only the best music.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.974
Hey.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.782
What's he doing?

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
<i>Whoa!</i>

02:26.146 --> 02:27.489
( cheering )

02:27.648 --> 02:29.184
Danny, come on!

02:29.349 --> 02:31.829
Yeah, yeah!

02:31.985 --> 02:35.660
(cheering continues)

02:39.860 --> 02:42.500
( screaming )

02:42.663 --> 02:43.664
(thud)

02:49.102 --> 02:50.342
Oh, shit.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.347
It's the fucking curse.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.277
( Minibike approaching )

05:38.805 --> 05:40.785
Girl: It's only as few days
before graduation,

05:40.941 --> 05:43.444
and the curse
hasn't happened yet.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.723
Maybe it won't happen this year.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.837
Maybe all the other accidents
are just a coincidence.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.867
Hut!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.175
( shouts )

06:31.892 --> 06:34.736
Girl: At last year's sob fest,
the <i>class</i> president read a poem

06:34.895 --> 06:38.604
that went something like,
"Don't try to understand everything

06:38.765 --> 06:40.745
because some things
don't make sense."

06:40.901 --> 06:43.074
( squawking )

06:46.339 --> 06:50.014
But I can't help wondering
if the curse could be real.

07:07.227 --> 07:11.767
The tall swarthy astronaut-type
is why mom dragged us here.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.139
It's a bummer having a single
mother who's miserable.

07:14.301 --> 07:17.805
So if astronaut-guy makes
her happy, astronaut-guy it is.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.084
Man on radio: I mean,
come out of the suffering

07:28.248 --> 07:29.818
and problems that you face in life

07:29.983 --> 07:33.726
brought on because
of the choices that you make.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.096
You simply reap what you sow.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.895
Whoa!

07:39.059 --> 07:41.733
No one said a word about Rich
the whole way over,

07:41.895 --> 07:43.272
and I-- I would...

07:43.430 --> 07:46.604
I would like your opinion.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.110
Well, he isn't a meth addict.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.805
Can I go now?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.951
Sure.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.947
Mom, I like him.

07:57.110 --> 08:01.456
He seems nice, and I can tell
he really likes you.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.630
I think he does. Thank you.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.424
My angel.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.625
I like him, too.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.815
Boy: Who knows what Rich
has on his filthy,

08:26.973 --> 08:28.213
repressed religious mind.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.116
Cut him some slack.
He's taking her to Vegas.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.277
Be happy or fake it.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.014
I checked his Match.com profile.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.955
- He enjoys frisky women.
- I don't wanna hear this.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.154
And one day hopes to host
his own reality show.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.889
Let's hope for the best.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.466
Okay, so you've got all
the information. We're at the...

08:43.623 --> 08:45.466
Both: Mandalay Bay
and you'll be back Friday.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.899
Okay-

08:47.060 --> 08:48.971
I never left you alone before,

08:49.129 --> 08:52.702
so please, please,
please tell me not worry.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.507
It is about that time the curse
of Downer's Grove rolls in.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.172
Oh, my God.
I didn't even think of that.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.979
Mom, the curse is complete B.S.
We'll be fine.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.315
Go. Have a good time.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.821
Okay. God, I love you guys.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.721
Oh, my angels!

09:08.882 --> 09:09.986
Come here.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.152
No drumming after 7:00.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.159
Wish me luck.
How do I look?

09:16.322 --> 09:17.733
Is it okay?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.371
Okay, Dave, you don't have
to hear this part.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.029
I love you guys.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.768
Okay?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.050
Boy: Hey, Chrissie!

09:39.212 --> 09:41.283
Dave:
There's your stalker boyfriend.

09:43.616 --> 09:44.890
Chrissie: Stop it.

09:47.887 --> 09:51.232
- He's harmless.
- He totally likes you.

10:01.734 --> 10:02.735
For the zillionth time,

10:02.902 --> 10:05.075
her room's all pink and lace
and shit. Not your type.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.718
Do you really think
I'm interested in her room?

10:07.874 --> 10:09.478
What am I,
an interior decorator?

10:09.642 --> 10:12.486
You misread me completely
sometimes.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.387
Did I just pass your morn
and her new dude?

10:15.548 --> 10:17.585
- For an older guy, he's not bad.
- I totally agree.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.990
Drop it. Diner?

10:21.921 --> 10:24.834
And you're looking
exceptionally hot, Tracy.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.801
And you're looking
exceptionally 15, Dave.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.068
I think it's adorable
that you like me all the same.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.145
Has she seen
our Facebook page yet?

10:40.306 --> 10:43.446
Uh, I don't think so.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.420
I would've heard, so, no.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.286
Cool.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.691
I'll be jamming here later,
if you wanna hang or whatever.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.311
Why are we going this way?
Diner's in the other direction.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.010
I thought you might want to see
if grease boy was still working.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.712
His name's Bobby.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.356
What? How do you know?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.889
Because I asked him.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.617
When?

11:22.782 --> 11:25.058
First semester, when the brakes
on my <i>mom's</i> car went,

11:25.218 --> 11:27.630
I was sitting in the shop
waiting, and we got to talking.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.198
Why didn't you tell me?

11:32.725 --> 11:35.672
Oh. Oh, I see.
You gave it up to him

11:35.828 --> 11:38.741
in some hot steamy love pit
out back, didn't you?

11:38.898 --> 11:40.741
You have to ask
why I didn't tell you?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.641
You guys have been at it
like bunnies.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.645
No. Nothing happened.
We're friends.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.750
- With benefits?
- No.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.647
Not even minimal benefits?

11:48.808 --> 11:51.812
Not unless you count giving
my mom a discount a benefit.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.389
(giggling )

11:53.546 --> 11:56.322
So wait, hold on.
What's he like?

11:56.482 --> 11:58.985
Actually, he defies the clichÃ©
of townie mechanic.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.393
He's smart, ambitious.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.194
He can reassemble an engine
in a day.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.894
Why would anyone
want to do that?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.032
Just drive.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.881
That's his car.

12:18.037 --> 12:21.575
Dude, that's a lime green
fucking muscle car.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.584
So? I like that about him.
It's unique.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.223
So you already broke the ice
and then some?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.086
Ruthless with holder!

12:28.248 --> 12:31.695
What am I supposed to do with
this battery in my backseat?

12:31.851 --> 12:33.228
You lost me.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.593
I was supposed to take it
to the recycling center,

12:35.755 --> 12:37.132
but then I selflessly thought,

12:37.290 --> 12:38.963
"Hey, wouldn't this be
a nice opportunity

12:39.125 --> 12:40.399
for Chrissie
to meet her crush?

12:40.560 --> 12:43.439
Ask him to help
with the battery..."

12:43.596 --> 12:45.542
Apparently I'm out of the loop.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.374
( Tracy echoing )
You gave it up to him

12:48.534 --> 12:51.538
in some hot steamy love pit
out back, didn't you?

12:51.704 --> 12:53.775
He's totally your first, isn't he?

12:56.042 --> 12:59.580
You raging 'ho.
Why the hell didn't you...

13:14.427 --> 13:17.499
Tracy: I bet it's gonna be
Matt Goldberg or James Rocchi.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.337
I have a weird feeling.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.479
Plus they're super secret
Internet pervs

13:21.634 --> 13:23.443
into underage shit
that'd make you puke.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.812
Total sinners
and begging to be punished.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.946
Girl:
I bet Lauren Solomon.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.149
Bitch.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.022
What are you doing?

13:37.183 --> 13:40.164
Trying to work out who's next.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.493
Chrissie: Did you ever think
maybe there'll be no next?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.295
After so many in a row?
There's gotta be a next.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.528
Says who?

13:46.693 --> 13:48.104
Well, the curse.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.672
Oh, so you spoke to the curse?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.706
Chrissie, ever since '04,

13:51.864 --> 13:54.344
a senior's died
right before graduation.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.037
Girl: '05, Nina Golden
drowned in the quarry.

13:57.203 --> 14:00.309
Girl #2: '06, Scott Riley drove over
the embankment at Knoll's Hill.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.146
Both of them were drunk,
by the way.

14:02.308 --> 14:05.949
Girl: 2007, Jason Martin
shot in the liquor store.

14:06.112 --> 14:09.616
2008, Myra Crawford, OD'd.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.228
2009, '10, '11, '12.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.195
Frank Esposito
ripped in half by the train.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.494
Jennifer Licari, vanished.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.659
Amy Mazur died in her sleep.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.567
Keith Hardy, farming accident.

14:21.728 --> 14:26.234
Last year, Michael Shaw,
water tower.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.572
We were there, Chrissie.
We saw it.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.205
I saw a meth head
choosing to climb a water tower,

14:32.372 --> 14:33.646
not a curse.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.410
I have to go.
I have a paper to finish.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.215
You still have homework?
We're graduating on Saturday.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.824
I'm late with my big report.
Mr. Keller gave me an extension.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.017
I'm having a really hard time
concentrating.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.559
Why? The curse?

14:44.717 --> 14:48.255
Yeah. I mean,
someone we know is gonna die.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.526
Look, we make choices.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.762
Those choices produce results,
good or bad.

14:53.926 --> 14:57.874
Climbing a water tower high?
Bad choice, bad result.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.202
Going home to do your report

14:59.365 --> 15:00.605
and forgetting all about
this curse so you can finish?

15:00.767 --> 15:03.748
Good choice, good result.
See what I'm saying?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.507
See you guys tomorrow.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.706
Or maybe you won't.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.546
Not funny, Chrissie.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.245
She's right.
Don't joke about it.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.721
Lighten up.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.087
Tracy:
Way to clear a room.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.786
Chrissie: Look, I want
to believe in a better place.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.557
I remember all my
Sunday School stories.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.031
Woman who turned into salt,
Noah's Ark,

15:24.190 --> 15:26.534
the burning bush,
the star in the east.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.228
I just hope they're all true

15:28.394 --> 15:31.534
and not a bunch of made-up
stories thrown into a book.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.370
I mean, if there's a God,

15:33.533 --> 15:35.137
why would he make my dad
addicted to meth

15:35.301 --> 15:38.077
so he could abandon
a wife and two kids?

15:38.237 --> 15:40.114
And why would he give
my 12-year-old cousin

15:40.273 --> 15:42.253
incurable bone cancer?

15:42.408 --> 15:43.785
These are just personal gripes.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.889
I'm not even gonna
to get into wars,

15:46.045 --> 15:48.321
gas fucking ovens,
ethnic cleansing,

15:48.481 --> 15:49.983
random, meaningless violence
and all that,

15:50.149 --> 15:51.321
'cause we'd be here all night.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.054
Wow.

15:53.219 --> 15:56.063
That's hardcore deep shit, man.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.498
I have a lot of stuff on my mind.

15:58.658 --> 15:59.898
Way too much stuff.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.060
What the fuck?

16:01.227 --> 16:04.731
Cut the shit! Jesus!

16:04.897 --> 16:06.934
What's your problem, guy?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.080
Are you psychic?
My name is Guy.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.647
- No shit.
- Yeah, shit.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.613
We were wondering if you girls
wanted to join us

16:13.773 --> 16:15.480
on a little adventure.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.781
Maybe next time when you don't
scare the shit out of us.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.418
You don't know who he is,
do you?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.084
Um, no.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.196
Hi, pretty-

16:26.352 --> 16:27.990
I'm Chuck.
What's your name?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.634
I'm Brittany,
she's Courtney.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.168
But we have to go.
Finals for college.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.830
College? Really?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.533
You guys look like maybe
you're still in high school.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.645
And maybe you're worried
about the curse.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.214
We survived the curse.
We're at Northwestern.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.782
Where do you go?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.384
Willow Creek.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.545
Chuck is our star QB.
Do you guys not read the paper?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.452
He was our backup
junior year--

16:53.613 --> 16:56.219
Hey, Guy, shut the fuck up.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.953
Why don't you guys
come to a party

16:59.118 --> 17:01.155
over on our side of town?
It'll be fun.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.833
No.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.972
Hold, please, Chuck.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.902
( Whispers )
Please don't make me beg.

17:10.061 --> 17:11.734
Willow Creek's
in another county.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.844
We'll do a drive-by.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.675
If it's sketch,
we'll get out of there, okay?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.544
Please.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.343
- Chuck?
- Yeah.

17:21.507 --> 17:25.147
It's a bad night.
Maybe some other time.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.985
What if I promise
to have you home

17:30.149 --> 17:31.423
before you turn
into a pumpkin?

17:31.584 --> 17:33.359
Scout's honor.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.578
( Music playing )

18:04.784 --> 18:05.922
( glass shatters )

18:11.757 --> 18:13.703
Let's not do
anything stupid, okay?

18:13.859 --> 18:14.860
When have I ever?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.904
- Really want me to answer that?
- Yes!

18:17.063 --> 18:19.703
Actually, no.

18:26.405 --> 18:29.409
( Music continues)

18:31.777 --> 18:33.415
âª Bottles don't pop âª

18:33.579 --> 18:34.785
âª Drinks don't spill âª

18:34.947 --> 18:37.427
âª I don't even drink,
but the party's over here âª

18:37.583 --> 18:39.961
âª Flight ain't even land,
but my terminal is filled âª

18:40.119 --> 18:41.427
âª Because they hear
that I'm the man âª

18:41.587 --> 18:42.827
âª Yeah, I'm terminally ill âª

18:42.989 --> 18:45.595
âª There's a feeling,
don't you fight it âª

18:45.758 --> 18:48.500
âª I got the flame to the game
and I'm about to reignite âª

18:48.661 --> 18:49.799
âª I see your little face âª

18:49.962 --> 18:51.270
âª Baby girl,
don't try to hide it âª

18:51.430 --> 18:53.774
âª If you had the chance
to live it, won't you try it? âª

18:53.933 --> 18:57.005
âª 'Cause there's a party over here,
party over here âª

18:57.169 --> 19:02.619
âª Party over here,
party over here âª

19:02.775 --> 19:05.915
âª And if you ain't heard,
it's the party of the year âª

19:06.078 --> 19:07.614
He's kinda cute.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.952
You could totally
make out with him.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.492
I wouldn't say anything.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.527
It would just be
between you and me

19:12.685 --> 19:14.255
and everyone else
who's watching.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.763
( laughing )

19:15.921 --> 19:18.197
One, two, three.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.133
All right.
Let's go find those boys.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.276
I'll be there in a sec.
You'll be okay, right?

19:26.432 --> 19:29.311
I'll be fine. Very fine.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.665
Hey.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.630
Hey, you.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.860
It's good to see you.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.065
I didn't think
you were gonna come.

19:58.230 --> 20:02.144
Yeah, me, too.
( laughs )

20:02.301 --> 20:04.907
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.012
Shh.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.986
Whoa. Um...

20:18.150 --> 20:20.528
I have to pee.

20:20.686 --> 20:23.667
Sorry. I'm just gonna...
Just a sec.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.673
(water running)

20:43.275 --> 20:44.413
(turns faucet off)

20:47.713 --> 20:49.090
( knocking )

20:49.248 --> 20:50.454
Just a sec.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.142
Hey.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.211
What was that?

21:10.369 --> 21:12.747
I had to go to the bathroom?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.282
Relax, relax, relax.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.485
Relax, relax, relax.
It's okay, it's okay.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.823
- Um...
- It's okay. Shh...

21:28.454 --> 21:30.127
Why are you freaking out?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.633
- I'm not. I'm just--
- Shh...

21:37.730 --> 21:40.609
- Um, Chuck, I feel like--
- It's okay. You feel like what?

21:40.766 --> 21:42.677
I feel like I should probably
go find Tracy.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.076
Make sure she's okay.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.808
- She's fine.
- Chuck...

21:47.973 --> 21:50.647
Hey. Whoa!
Slow down.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.484
Hey! Whoa!
Chuck, come on, please?

21:55.414 --> 21:57.189
Chuck, please?

21:57.349 --> 21:58.487
- Please.
- Shh...

21:58.651 --> 22:00.028
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

22:00.186 --> 22:01.290
I'm just--

22:01.453 --> 22:03.763
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

22:03.923 --> 22:04.958
Please don't!

22:05.124 --> 22:06.125
Stop it! Please!

22:06.292 --> 22:08.033
Come on! Stop it!

22:08.194 --> 22:10.800
- Wait till we finish.
- Get the fuck off me, Chuck.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.806
This is it.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.206
Hey!

22:15.367 --> 22:17.973
Fuckin' finish it, bitch!

22:18.137 --> 22:19.639
Fuck off me!
Get off of me!

22:19.805 --> 22:21.478
- Get off!
- ( Chuck screams)

22:21.640 --> 22:24.052
(screaming continues)

22:26.045 --> 22:27.888
Where's Chuck?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.995
(groaning )

22:39.158 --> 22:40.637
Are you okay?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.636
What the fuck
does it look like, you idiot?

22:42.795 --> 22:44.172
( Groans )

22:45.798 --> 22:48.404
Tracy? That guy Chuck
tried to fucking rape me.

22:48.567 --> 22:51.810
Get out of there!
It's not fucking safe!

23:01.914 --> 23:03.188
Hey!

23:03.349 --> 23:08.025
( Barking )

23:26.238 --> 23:28.377
- Are you okay?
- Get us out of here.

23:31.610 --> 23:35.524
Okay, so definitely not
one of my best ideas.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.357
Do you think the curse
may be on one of us?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.124
No.

23:43.289 --> 23:46.361
I mean, one of us would be dead,
right? If it was on one of us.

23:46.525 --> 23:47.902
Maybe it just, like,
passed over us.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.801
Shut the fuck up!

23:49.962 --> 23:54.069
Okay. It's gonna be fine.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.406
No, it's not gonna be
fucking fine!

23:56.568 --> 23:57.603
Why not?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.716
Because I think I just poked
some fucking guy's eye out,

23:59.872 --> 24:02.478
so it's <i>so</i> far
from fucking fine!

24:04.209 --> 24:07.088
We can never tell
anyone about this, okay?

24:07.246 --> 24:08.281
Okay-

24:14.820 --> 24:16.322
( horn honking )

24:16.488 --> 24:18.126
We need a plan.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.261
( Honki)

24:23.762 --> 24:24.832
( honking )

24:27.633 --> 24:28.805
( honki)

24:34.940 --> 24:36.442
Shit.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.658
(Chrissie, thinking )
God, if you do exist and can hear me,

24:47.820 --> 24:50.460
please let this all be a bad dream.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.440
Man on TV: Our friend
seems to be awakening.

25:00.599 --> 25:05.139
Man #2: I-- where--
where is this? Where am I?

25:05.304 --> 25:07.341
Man #1:
Do not be alarmed, my friend.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.884
My man Ivan found
you in the crypt.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.283
( Water spraying )

25:18.317 --> 25:19.318
Shit.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.692
Oh, God!

25:21.854 --> 25:23.356
(grunts)

25:24.356 --> 25:25.460
Fu...

25:26.458 --> 25:27.801
( groans )

25:27.960 --> 25:29.837
Oh, shit.

25:29.995 --> 25:31.474
Oh, God!

25:31.630 --> 25:35.305
( Panting )

25:35.467 --> 25:36.468
( groans )

25:36.635 --> 25:38.637
( panting )

25:44.743 --> 25:47.724
What are you doing?
Let me see your eye.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.359
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?

25:49.515 --> 25:51.017
- Can you see?
- No.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.220
- What?
- No, I can't see!

25:53.385 --> 25:54.728
You know what that does to
your fucking football career?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.389
No, I don't know!

25:56.555 --> 26:00.367
They won't even hire
a fucking one-eyed mascot!

26:00.526 --> 26:04.064
I busted my ass for years to get
you out of this fucked-up town!

26:04.229 --> 26:06.266
And now...

26:06.432 --> 26:08.434
Damn it!

26:11.170 --> 26:12.911
( Whimpers )

26:26.418 --> 26:29.365
(voices whispering )

26:39.064 --> 26:41.635
( chanting )

26:46.305 --> 26:47.943
( girl screams )

26:48.107 --> 26:50.815
( min grunts)

26:50.976 --> 26:51.977
(chanting continues)

26:52.144 --> 26:53.589
(Girl, echoing)
Someone we know is gonna die.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.588
( Gasps )

27:07.392 --> 27:08.393
Chrissie:
I've been dreaming about Indians

27:08.560 --> 27:10.631
since I was a little girl.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.072
Maybe it's because
our town was built

27:13.232 --> 27:16.941
on land that was stolen
from the Indians in 1832.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.451
I can't help but wonder

27:21.607 --> 27:23.587
if this has something to do
with the curse.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.244
But if that were the case,

27:25.410 --> 27:27.913
then all of America
would be cursed.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.253
Maybe we all are.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.356
Stop it.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.798
You're making connections
that aren't there.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.493
There is no fucking curse,

27:40.659 --> 27:42.434
God is elusive if he exists,

27:42.594 --> 27:44.665
and you poked out
some goon's eye at a party

27:44.830 --> 27:47.208
after he tried to rape you.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.279
That's reality.
Get out of your head and deal.

27:52.171 --> 27:57.211
What are you doing?

27:57.376 --> 27:59.947
The acoustics in the basement
started to sound funk-defied.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.355
It's five in the morning.
Everything sounds...

28:03.515 --> 28:05.290
whatever it is you just said.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.452
You came in last night like
you were in a wrestling match

28:07.619 --> 28:09.121
with an engine.

28:09.288 --> 28:12.292
You finally get into it
with that mechanic?

28:12.457 --> 28:15.370
Hey, what is going on with you?

28:17.896 --> 28:19.375
What happened last night?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.636
Nothing.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.178
Hey, hey-

28:24.336 --> 28:26.043
When Dad was around
and had his fits,

28:26.205 --> 28:27.878
you always
protected me and mom.

28:28.040 --> 28:33.251
The least I can do is step up
and help when you need it.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.914
Okay-

28:37.316 --> 28:39.660
I don't even know
where to start.

28:39.818 --> 28:42.424
Ask me about last night.
Whatever you want.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.999
Did Tracy say anything
about me?

28:46.158 --> 28:47.535
Dweeb.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.503
I have other follow-u ps.
That was just my lead-in.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.559
(line ringing)

29:13.719 --> 29:16.859
( ringtone playing )

29:23.362 --> 29:25.137
What?

29:26.565 --> 29:28.476
Did you give any of them
your real name?

29:28.634 --> 29:30.113
Hell, no.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.612
What about your purse
with your lD's?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.215
Do you still have it?

29:33.372 --> 29:36.148
Hell, yes. Good night.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.788
It's already morning.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.936
(bell ringing)

30:01.066 --> 30:02.443
Sorry.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.979
It's okay. I'm just jumpy.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.913
You know, we've been friends
since we were in kindergarten,

30:08.073 --> 30:11.179
and there's something weird
happening between us.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.686
I can't take it anymore.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.482
What do you mean?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.956
You haven't answered my texts
in weeks. What did I do?

30:17.115 --> 30:19.527
Nothing.
I'vejust been really busy.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.162
Is it the mechanic?

30:22.321 --> 30:24.323
Are you keeping tabs on me?

30:24.489 --> 30:28.869
Your brother is a font
of useful info, and...

30:29.027 --> 30:31.507
- I happen to care a little bit.
- ( bell ringing)

30:31.663 --> 30:34.644
- Come on. I'm parked near you.
- All right.

30:37.969 --> 30:40.176
I guess I have been
avoiding you.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.647
Why?

30:41.807 --> 30:43.616
I don't wanna hurt you.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.118
Hurt me from what?

30:45.277 --> 30:48.349
You know, we went to prom,
and that happened.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.617
It's just weird.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.818
Because you laid
a sloppy kiss on me?

30:51.983 --> 30:55.294
We were drunk, and we kissed.
So what?

30:55.454 --> 30:57.400
I don't want to lead you on.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.469
Whoa. You thought
I spun a drunken kiss

31:00.625 --> 31:03.538
into some kind of
potential relationship?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.572
Really?

31:07.466 --> 31:09.207
I'm such an idiot.

31:09.368 --> 31:13.009
( laughing )

31:13.171 --> 31:16.709
I can just erase it
from my mind, if you so wish.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.482
Want me to-- Okay.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.992
There you go. It's gone.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.024
Come on.

31:28.186 --> 31:29.563
Where are we going?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.564
I don't remember
what I was doing.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.863
You and Monica Chase?
When did that happen?

31:35.026 --> 31:38.030
Uh, recent, recent.
Very recent.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.570
Sorry. You should wait here
for a second.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.614
What are you doing here?

31:50.776 --> 31:53.382
You're not a very nice girl.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.525
I mean, why the fuck would you
do something like this

31:57.682 --> 31:59.855
to somebody who has
an earnest interest in you?

32:00.018 --> 32:02.362
An earnest interest
in raping me.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.229
Is that how you remember it?

32:05.390 --> 32:07.893
I seem to recall it differently.

32:09.694 --> 32:10.934
No?

32:11.096 --> 32:12.700
What do you want, Chuck?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.302
What do I want?

32:18.570 --> 32:20.311
What do I want?

32:27.112 --> 32:29.888
- Can I get a ride?
- No.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.584
Dave, right?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.491
How do you know his name?

32:33.652 --> 32:34.892
I'm Chuck.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.465
Pleasure.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.795
By the way, I'm really sorry
to hear about your dad.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.064
It's... terrible.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.300
No kid should have
to go through that.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.505
- Hi, pal.
- Hi.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.514
Who the hell was that?
And how does he know about Dad?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.846
Chuck Whitmore,
starting QB for Willow

32:57.008 --> 32:58.954
with a really fucked-up eye.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.589
If either of you
ever see him again,

33:00.745 --> 33:02.122
just stay away from him.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.830
Why are you here
on your day off?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.997
The sooner I get the cars
into racing shape,

33:19.164 --> 33:21.201
the sooner I can sell them.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.615
What's wrong?

33:29.774 --> 33:32.550
Are you mothering
your mom again?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.782
No. She's away.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.392
I just did something
really stupid.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.120
Like what?

33:42.153 --> 33:45.794
You know that group of
Willow Creek football players?

33:45.957 --> 33:49.302
Yeah. They drive by
wasted all the time.

33:49.461 --> 33:52.465
Yeah, well, Tracy and I went
to one of their parties,

33:52.631 --> 33:57.205
and that guy Chuck
tried to attack me.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.381
Are you okay?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.214
Yeah.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.687
Look, if he ever
comes near you again,

34:07.846 --> 34:11.020
just promise me
you'll come to me for help.

34:16.353 --> 34:19.164
( Heavy breathing )

34:19.324 --> 34:21.201
You're pretty cute
when you're worried.

34:24.195 --> 34:27.199
Nice. That's nice.

34:27.364 --> 34:29.504
How about when
I'm not worried?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.705
Un-cute?

34:31.870 --> 34:33.746
No, no, no, no.

34:33.905 --> 34:37.011
You're beautiful.

34:37.175 --> 34:40.121
But, um, you worry a lot.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.280
- So...
- I 9i99le5)

34:42.447 --> 34:43.891
Nice save, Bobby.

34:44.049 --> 34:46.290
- I should go.
- Uh...

34:46.451 --> 34:48.897
No, well, look, don't--
You don't have to leave.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.862
I'm gonna be working
on this car for a while,

34:51.022 --> 34:55.630
so you're more than welcome to
stay if... you still want to.

34:55.793 --> 34:59.401
Bobby, mind if I make a complete
and utter ass of myself?

34:59.564 --> 35:01.441
The floor's yours.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.580
I've been coming by for months.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.737
We share all these
intimate secrets, and...

35:05.904 --> 35:08.077
why haven't you
asked me out?

35:10.976 --> 35:13.047
L-- I don't know.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.456
Okay, uh...

35:18.617 --> 35:21.757
Sorry for putting you
on the spot.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.593
Bye.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.841
(grunting )

35:58.823 --> 36:00.302
What did the doctor say?

36:00.458 --> 36:02.495
( Panting )

36:05.030 --> 36:06.441
You can play, right?

36:06.598 --> 36:08.942
Spot me. Spot me.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.038
All right. One more.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.309
(grunts)

36:18.109 --> 36:19.816
- What did the doctor say?
- Shut up!

36:19.978 --> 36:22.356
Would you just
shut the fuck up?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.790
What'd the doctor say?
He said I'm fucking blind.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.792
That if I'm lucky,
I'll be seeing in my right eye

36:26.951 --> 36:29.397
in about 35 fucking years.
That's what the doctor said.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.556
That someday maybe
I'll end up being

36:31.723 --> 36:34.795
some fucking townie piece
of shit loser like you, Guy.

36:34.959 --> 36:38.634
Maybe someday
if I'm fucking lucky!

36:38.797 --> 36:39.798
Fuck!

36:40.799 --> 36:43.336
( Door opens, closes )

36:46.638 --> 36:47.844
Chrissie.

36:49.474 --> 36:52.387
Ian, what's wrong?
What happened?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.421
I was jumped.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.219
- Did you see him?
- Who?

36:57.382 --> 37:01.330
- Whoever did this.
- It happened too fast.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.424
Does this have to do with you?

37:05.590 --> 37:08.662
It's better if you just
keep away from me.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.738
But...

37:22.073 --> 37:24.053
- So you hold it like that.
- Yeah?

37:24.209 --> 37:27.247
- Make sure you press here.
- But what's that going to do?

37:27.412 --> 37:29.255
Just ignore that.
That's just decoration.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.415
- Decoration?
- Yeah.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.925
- You drew that?
- Yeah.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.619
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah?

37:33.785 --> 37:35.355
( laughing )

37:35.520 --> 37:36.590
- Okay, show me.
-( door opens)

37:36.755 --> 37:38.132
Show me.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.402
- ( Door closes)
- Ugh!

37:42.560 --> 37:44.972
God, this is not happening.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.132
- Seriously?
- Wait! Hey!

37:47.298 --> 37:50.074
Dave said the freak show
showed up at school today.

37:50.235 --> 37:51.578
( Whispers )
Shit, man.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.615
Yeah, he came by school,
knew exactly who I was,

37:59.778 --> 38:01.280
who my brother was,
mentioned Dad.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.323
Yeah? Hmm?

38:03.481 --> 38:04.824
What are you doing?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.758
You know,
I think the freak show

38:06.918 --> 38:09.091
was probably just
trying to scare you.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.460
What?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.295
(distant drumming)

38:12.457 --> 38:14.994
What are you not telling me?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.336
I'm sorry.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.443
In advance.

38:21.599 --> 38:23.442
(drumming continues)

38:23.601 --> 38:26.582
You agreed to what?
A fucking party here?

38:26.738 --> 38:29.150
- Are you out of your mind?
- It was her idea.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.981
- We came up with it together.
- It's all over Facebook.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.646
Yeah, if you checked your page,
Tracy's page, or my page,

38:34.813 --> 38:35.814
you would've known last week.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.186
What's that supposed to mean?

38:37.348 --> 38:40.420
- Tell her, Tracy.
- Yeah, tell me, Tracy.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.690
We werejust thinking you could
use a little social jolt

38:42.854 --> 38:44.265
heading into summer.

38:44.422 --> 38:47.028
How selfless of you both,
but no fucking way.

38:47.192 --> 38:49.365
Tracy, you may like
hooking up with random dudes,

38:49.527 --> 38:50.835
doing whatever drug they put
in front of your face,

38:50.995 --> 38:52.201
but that's not me.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.001
I have a dad
who's an addict, okay?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.145
Could even be dead by now,
for all I know.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.872
I don't want people doing weird
shit in this fucking house!

38:59.037 --> 39:01.677
Cancel it.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.650
What? Post it on Facebook.
Canceled.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.447
It's not that easy.

39:06.611 --> 39:09.490
It's been on our Twitter feeds.
We sent out a mass email.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.786
If you paid more attention
to social media

39:11.950 --> 39:14.362
instead of lurking around a gas
station between honors classes,

39:14.519 --> 39:17.159
- you'd know.
- Shut up! Shut up!

39:17.322 --> 39:19.962
Find a way to cancel that party.

39:20.124 --> 39:23.298
And stop smoking that shit
in the house!

39:30.835 --> 39:32.542
Hey, Bobby. What's up?

39:33.671 --> 39:37.016
Um... uh...

39:37.175 --> 39:39.553
Chrissie's best-kept secret
here in the flesh.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.521
Bobby, is it? I have heard
so many rad stories about you.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.353
Weren't you in the middle of
something really important?

39:44.515 --> 39:46.688
Oh, yeah, right, the party.
Tuesday night.

39:46.851 --> 39:48.888
I hope you can make it, Bobby.

39:53.491 --> 39:55.334
Urn, so...

39:55.493 --> 39:57.370
Y-Yeah...

39:57.528 --> 40:00.941
I came over here to, uh...

40:01.099 --> 40:04.342
just to ask you if you would
like to go on a date with me.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.345
Now?

40:06.504 --> 40:10.042
No, not-- not now.
We don't have to go now.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.449
If you don't, if you can't--
I can come hack.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.385
Now's perfect. Uh...

40:14.545 --> 40:16.456
I'm just gonna go change
real quick.

40:16.614 --> 40:17.718
Okay-

40:21.219 --> 40:22.562
Ohh...

40:39.971 --> 40:41.951
(engine starts)

40:48.279 --> 40:49.724
Chrissie:
It's beautiful.

40:50.915 --> 40:53.452
Bobby: Question--
what where you thinking,

40:53.618 --> 40:55.461
going to that party
in the first place?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.896
Why? Do I sense
a little jealousy?

40:58.056 --> 41:01.435
Let's... call it concern.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.764
Next question.

41:06.931 --> 41:10.105
What does a girl like you want
with a grease monkey like me?

41:11.769 --> 41:13.305
God. I don't know.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.747
You're, uh...

41:15.907 --> 41:18.080
You're different.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.787
So what do you think
about this curse

41:24.949 --> 41:26.758
everyone keeps talking about?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.454
( Heavy breathing )

41:28.619 --> 41:30.826
That's like asking
if you believe in God,

41:30.989 --> 41:33.697
the afterlife,
the supernatural.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.860
Do you?

41:36.027 --> 41:37.370
( Chuckles )

41:37.528 --> 41:39.667
No. The curse?
Absolutely not.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.811
What about God?

41:41.966 --> 41:44.537
I mean, I'm not really
a religious guy or anything,

41:44.702 --> 41:46.978
but just look at that sky.

41:47.138 --> 41:50.176
Impossible that was man-made.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.945
It's made up of molecules.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.887
The clouds are made up
of tiny droplets of water

41:56.047 --> 41:59.824
and ice crystals so light
they hang in the sky.

41:59.984 --> 42:03.557
I flunked in whatever class
you learned that in, but...

42:03.721 --> 42:06.327
let's agree it's not man-made.

42:06.491 --> 42:07.799
Okay-

42:10.828 --> 42:13.502
( heavy breathing )

42:14.832 --> 42:15.970
Um...

42:17.869 --> 42:20.042
What about
physical attraction?

42:20.204 --> 42:24.346
Is that made up
of molecules, too?

42:33.251 --> 42:34.525
Sorry.

42:50.668 --> 42:51.703
( Knocking )

42:55.006 --> 42:56.542
You're fucking...

42:56.707 --> 42:58.948
You're fucking
out of your mind, dude.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.851
What the fuck
are you doing here?

43:01.012 --> 43:02.787
I need to talk to her.
It's really important.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.858
No, it's not!
Get the fuck out!

43:05.016 --> 43:09.123
Bobby, it's fine, okay?
I'll be back in one second.

43:09.287 --> 43:10.630
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

43:10.788 --> 43:12.392
This is something
that I have to do.

43:12.557 --> 43:15.231
Roll your window up.
He's high <i>as</i> hell.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.373
He tried to fucking rape you.

43:17.528 --> 43:20.737
Bobby, I can handle this.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.720
What? Are you stalking me?

43:32.877 --> 43:34.584
Did you attack my friend Ian?

43:34.745 --> 43:35.746
No.

43:35.913 --> 43:37.153
( Car door opens )

43:40.818 --> 43:44.459
I, uh... Can I just--
I need to talk to you.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.431
About what?

43:46.591 --> 43:49.595
I've been thinking about
that thing you said.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.433
The question you asked.

43:51.596 --> 43:52.768
What question?

43:52.930 --> 43:55.934
About what I want.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.808
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

44:00.805 --> 44:03.513
Um... I had a dream.

44:03.674 --> 44:06.314
And it was fucking vivid.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.821
And then all of sudden, it just...

44:08.980 --> 44:11.426
All this stuff made sense.

44:11.582 --> 44:14.085
What? What made sense?

44:15.586 --> 44:17.361
This.

44:17.522 --> 44:19.695
What are you talking about?

44:21.259 --> 44:23.933
See, I know that you...

44:24.095 --> 44:26.507
You're feeling the same thing
I'm feeling.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.337
Chuck...

44:28.499 --> 44:30.206
I don't.

44:30.368 --> 44:33.508
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, you do.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.878
You have to.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.145
- No. You're crazy.
- Right?

44:38.309 --> 44:39.481
No, Chuck.

44:39.644 --> 44:42.386
Yeah. And...

44:42.547 --> 44:44.527
And that's why
this all makes sense.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.355
You know,
that's why I forgive you.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.861
Forgive me?
Are you kidding?

44:49.020 --> 44:51.398
That's why this is
gonna work for us.

44:51.556 --> 44:54.799
Chuck, there is no "we."

44:54.959 --> 44:57.462
There is no fucking "us."

44:57.628 --> 44:59.471
Whatever you think
you know about me,

44:59.630 --> 45:02.736
it's all fucking made up
in your head.

45:02.900 --> 45:05.141
All this shit you're doing,
following me,

45:05.303 --> 45:06.873
you need to stop it,

45:07.038 --> 45:09.678
and you just need to keep
the fuck away from me, Chuck.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.753
Stay the fuck away from me.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.390
( Car doors close )

45:18.549 --> 45:22.019
(engine starts)

45:22.186 --> 45:24.723
(car pulls away)

45:24.889 --> 45:28.427
( police radio chatter)

45:28.593 --> 45:30.766
He followed us to the bluff.

45:30.928 --> 45:32.669
Man:
What did he say exactly?

45:32.830 --> 45:35.504
He thinks we're in
some kind of relationship.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.374
Unfortunately there's not much
we can do with that.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.015
Chrissie:
This guy's serious.

45:40.171 --> 45:41.775
He tried to rape me.

45:41.939 --> 45:43.509
- Any witnesses?
- No.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.745
He cornered me in a bathroom.

45:45.910 --> 45:48.390
Hey, look,
I mean, she's here now.

45:48.546 --> 45:50.617
Do you guys really want to be
the ones who were warned

45:50.781 --> 45:52.283
and then dropped the ball
after the fact?

45:52.450 --> 45:54.521
Can't just arrest him.
I can pay him a visit,

45:54.685 --> 45:56.062
let him know
we've been made aware.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.222
Usually that's enough.
What's his name?

45:58.389 --> 46:01.734
- Chuck Whitmore.
- Chuck Whitmore.

46:01.892 --> 46:03.963
The WC football player.

46:04.128 --> 46:05.766
Chuck Whitmore.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.604
Yeah, Charlie Whitmore's son.
Charlie's one of us.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.473
So what, that makes him
untouchable?

46:10.635 --> 46:13.309
I think it's best if we
show it to Charlie first.

46:13.471 --> 46:15.041
That's enough for now.

46:15.206 --> 46:17.447
When we know more,
you'll know more.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.315
- So that's it?
- Yeah.

46:19.477 --> 46:21.889
That's it.

46:29.587 --> 46:31.396
His dad's an ex-cop?

46:31.555 --> 46:35.401
Right, yeah.
Which is not a good thing.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.061
Didn't make me feel any better.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.469
As soon as I mentioned his name,
they completely changed.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.234
I'm definitely staying over.

46:41.399 --> 46:42.400
Awesome.

46:42.566 --> 46:43.840
On <i>the couch.</i>

46:44.001 --> 46:45.480
That's cool.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.343
Jake pissed on it a bunch.
It's been cleaned.

46:47.505 --> 46:49.007
I don't know if it ever
really, truly comes out,

46:49.173 --> 46:50.447
but if you want to...

46:50.608 --> 46:53.646
Chrissie:
Stop. Please?

46:54.812 --> 46:59.784
Well, hey, I don't want to
invite myself over--

46:59.950 --> 47:02.624
Yes. Stay.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.157
That'd be good.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.495
Okay, cool. Well, um...

47:10.661 --> 47:13.107
I guess I just need to let my boss
know I'll be in and out.

47:14.965 --> 47:16.603
Are you sure you don't mind
sticking around?

47:16.767 --> 47:18.610
No, of course not.

47:18.769 --> 47:20.942
Does that thing work?

47:21.105 --> 47:22.982
Okay, well, use it.

47:32.516 --> 47:35.019
( Beeping )

48:04.081 --> 48:05.924
( clatter )

48:06.083 --> 48:08.324
(dog barking )

48:27.772 --> 48:28.876
- ( girl screams)
- What are you doing?

48:29.039 --> 48:30.040
Jesus!

48:30.207 --> 48:32.050
( laughs )
I'm sorry.

48:32.209 --> 48:34.246
I took a mean spill.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.722
Your brother has
some serious weed.

48:36.881 --> 48:38.224
( laughs )

48:39.784 --> 48:42.424
-( knocking )
- Hey, it's Bobby.

48:57.435 --> 48:58.436
I don't have a condom,

48:58.602 --> 49:01.139
and even if you do in your
wallet, I'm still a virgin,

49:01.305 --> 49:04.582
and I'd like for it
to stay that way, temporarily.

49:07.745 --> 49:10.089
You know, it hadn't even
crossed my mind.

49:11.382 --> 49:12.452
I was kidding.

49:12.616 --> 49:15.620
It did, but I got rid of
the idea quick.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.663
Okay, um...

49:17.822 --> 49:20.894
I should probably go to sleep
'cause I have school tomorrow.

49:23.994 --> 49:26.907
Will you be here
when I get back?

49:28.766 --> 49:31.838
Yeah, of course,
if it makes you feel safe.

49:35.606 --> 49:40.146
âª We don't need to say a thing âª

49:40.311 --> 49:41.756
No sex.

49:41.912 --> 49:45.155
- I What is true is true âª
- Okay.

49:48.486 --> 49:54.164
âª But never be
too far from me âª

49:54.325 --> 49:57.795
âª Nowl am a part of you âª

50:03.167 --> 50:06.944
âª Sail out past the breakers âª

50:24.455 --> 50:28.164
( Squawking )

50:34.965 --> 50:36.205
(grunts)

50:43.374 --> 50:45.047
(school bell ringing )

51:01.191 --> 51:02.329
Chrissie:
Maybe there is a curse,

51:02.493 --> 51:03.597
and this year it's on me.

51:03.761 --> 51:05.763
It's the curse.

51:13.871 --> 51:15.612
(Chrissie, thinking)
Maybe I'm the curse.

51:23.013 --> 51:24.458
Is that the mechanic's car?

51:24.615 --> 51:26.060
It's nothing.
Thanks for the ride.

51:26.216 --> 51:27.524
It's not nothing.
It belongs to that guy.

51:27.685 --> 51:29.687
So Why'd you have
to fucking ask, Ian?

51:29.853 --> 51:30.854
( Chuckles )

51:31.021 --> 51:33.194
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

51:33.357 --> 51:35.234
You barely said a word
the whole ride home.

51:35.392 --> 51:37.065
You got a stranger's car
in your driveway

51:37.227 --> 51:40.367
and this look on your face like
someone is trying to kill you.

51:40.531 --> 51:42.738
Oh, and your locker blew up.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.642
You can't pretend like
it's just another day.

51:47.404 --> 51:49.975
Hey, look, I've known you
since kindergarten.

51:50.140 --> 51:52.484
You can tell me anything.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.418
If you're worried
about the curse,

51:54.578 --> 51:57.286
there's only three days left
to graduation, and if there's--

51:57.448 --> 52:02.830
Bobby, whose car it is,
we started dating and...

52:02.987 --> 52:05.160
and the rest is PMS.

52:16.934 --> 52:19.608
(gunfire on TV)

52:19.770 --> 52:23.308
Guys, get out of your PJs
and cancel that fucking party.

52:23.474 --> 52:26.353
We tried. We posted
Facebook messages and...

52:26.510 --> 52:28.456
We did our best,
but it's in the ether,

52:28.612 --> 52:31.616
and we can't stop people
from showing up.

52:31.782 --> 52:33.819
What's wrong?
Something happen?

52:42.126 --> 52:43.662
Are you sure it was him?

52:43.827 --> 52:46.330
The fucking car battery
was in my locker, Tracy.

52:49.633 --> 52:50.634
Where are you going?

52:50.801 --> 52:52.144
It's probably better
if we don't talk about it.

52:52.302 --> 52:54.543
- You can't.
- The hell I can.

52:54.705 --> 52:56.378
If I don't do something about it,
it's just gonna get worse.

52:56.540 --> 52:57.712
Bobby...

52:57.875 --> 52:58.876
Come on.

52:59.043 --> 53:01.023
Hey, listen to me.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.350
Bobby?

53:02.513 --> 53:04.686
Bobby, I'm serious.
Come on.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.829
Look, you don't know me
that well. I can take him.

53:07.985 --> 53:09.623
You're right.
I don't know you.

53:09.787 --> 53:12.131
But I know that
if you do something stupid,

53:12.289 --> 53:15.862
you could wind up in jail
or worse.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.973
And I'm not up for that.

53:26.837 --> 53:28.248
Okay-

53:29.707 --> 53:32.187
We'll do it your way.

53:32.342 --> 53:33.753
- What is your way?
- I don't have a way.

53:33.911 --> 53:35.584
I can't think.

53:35.746 --> 53:39.888
You know, it might not be
such a bad idea to have the party.

53:40.050 --> 53:43.691
Just hear me out.
If this guy's stupid enough

53:43.854 --> 53:46.334
to show up at your door
uninvited with a bone to pick,

53:46.490 --> 53:48.197
we'll have plenty of witnesses.

53:48.358 --> 53:50.235
And as long as I can
make sure you're safe,

53:50.394 --> 53:54.774
then the cops or his dad
won't be able to save him.

53:54.932 --> 53:57.606
It's just nights like tonight
that I get so concerned about,

53:57.768 --> 53:59.213
the nights where
I won't be here.

53:59.369 --> 54:01.440
I don't get off till 3 a.m.

54:01.605 --> 54:03.448
I'll be here when you get back.

54:03.607 --> 54:05.348
I promise.

54:05.509 --> 54:07.182
You better be.

54:16.854 --> 54:17.924
( Door closes )

54:23.026 --> 54:24.403
Your new boyfriend is rad.

54:24.561 --> 54:25.938
And your girlfriend is a slut.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.576
You're not gonna hear
any complaints from me.

54:28.732 --> 54:31.872
She feels bad enough.
So do I.

54:33.637 --> 54:36.447
You remember how Dad
taught us how to shoot?

54:36.607 --> 54:39.281
Yeah. I have
permanent ear damage.

54:39.443 --> 54:41.923
Well, I guess he was too scared
to use his shotgun on himself

54:42.079 --> 54:44.821
before he left
and forgot it when he split.

54:44.982 --> 54:48.589
It's in my room under my bed.

54:48.752 --> 54:50.595
Good to know.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.099
( Screen door closes )

55:18.081 --> 55:20.425
( barking )

55:20.584 --> 55:22.325
( squawking )

55:36.133 --> 55:37.441
Girl:
It's the curse.

55:45.108 --> 55:46.781
(distant dog barking )

55:46.944 --> 55:51.222
- ( heavy breathing )
-( barking )

55:53.851 --> 55:56.161
( barking )

55:58.956 --> 56:02.028
-( barking )
. ( thud )

56:02.192 --> 56:03.535
- ( thud )
- ( footstep )

56:05.195 --> 56:09.041
-( barking )
. ( thud )

56:10.868 --> 56:12.870
Guys, please!

56:14.004 --> 56:16.143
-( Barking continues)
- Guys!

56:17.407 --> 56:19.045
- Please?
- ( dog squeals)

56:19.209 --> 56:21.553
- ( thud )
- ( dog whimpers)

56:25.349 --> 56:27.886
- Do you hear that?
- ( coughs )

56:28.051 --> 56:30.224
( barking continues)

56:30.387 --> 56:32.230
Sounds like
it's coming from outside.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.732
( Coughs )

56:33.891 --> 56:37.703
-( barking continues)
- ( tires screeching )

56:53.677 --> 56:56.556
Hey, Jake, what is it?

56:59.016 --> 57:00.962
Call the cops.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.285
Bobby!

57:34.451 --> 57:37.455
If you keep this up,
it's only gonna get uglier.

57:37.621 --> 57:39.726
Keep what up?

57:39.890 --> 57:43.269
You made your point, all right?
Just let it go.

57:43.427 --> 57:45.771
( laughs )
No, man.

57:45.929 --> 57:48.239
I haven't even come close
to making my point.

57:48.398 --> 57:50.309
(Sighs)

57:50.467 --> 57:51.775
( scoffs )

57:51.935 --> 57:53.471
So tell me, Bobby,

57:53.637 --> 57:56.777
what the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

57:58.642 --> 58:00.781
Whatever I have to.

58:02.612 --> 58:04.455
Let's take a walk.

58:12.022 --> 58:14.628
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up, back up, back up!

58:14.791 --> 58:17.135
Back up, back up.

58:18.762 --> 58:20.935
Put that down.

58:21.098 --> 58:23.100
Let's do this like men.
Put it down.

58:28.138 --> 58:30.015
I love that you think this is
gonna make a difference.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.312
When I'm done with her,
you're going to be tasting me

58:32.476 --> 58:34.956
for the rest of your life.

59:03.373 --> 59:05.011
Ooh!

59:08.178 --> 59:09.657
There you go.

59:12.849 --> 59:15.056
Good stuff.

59:25.028 --> 59:27.008
I learned a lot about
conflict resolution

59:27.164 --> 59:29.440
in my advanced psych classes.

59:29.599 --> 59:31.545
- Oh, did you?
- Mm-hmm.

59:31.701 --> 59:35.080
The last resort
is physical violence.

59:35.238 --> 59:37.411
I would've had him
had he not cheap-shotted me.

59:37.574 --> 59:38.575
( Heavy breathing )

59:38.742 --> 59:41.848
Look, you know about my dad
and meth, right?

59:42.012 --> 59:43.855
What I never told you
was that because of that

59:44.014 --> 59:47.291
he owed some money
to some bad people.

59:47.451 --> 59:49.294
I spent too many nights
either fighting him off

59:49.453 --> 59:51.865
or mending him.

59:52.022 --> 59:55.902
So, please, do not
go after Chuck again.

59:56.059 --> 59:58.539
Hey, look at me.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.739
Look at me.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.404
Say it.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:10.484
Say it.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.816
I won't go after him again.

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.154
Good.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.808
Boy:
We gotta figure out what to do.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.276
We can't just fucking
sit around here and just--

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:40.437
Boy #2: We're gonna fucking
do something.

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:41.776
As soon as Chuck
figures what we're doing,

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:42.939
we're gonna go fucking do it.

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.416
Whatever he says,
that's what we're gonna do.

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.852
What the fuck are we gonna do
about these two?

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.158
These chicks, man.

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.352
They think that they can get--

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:55.997
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm gonna fuck her friend.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.360
- Her little faggot brother, too.
- I'm gonna fuck--

01:00:58.522 --> 01:00:59.626
- So what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna do something.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:00.790
We're going to fucking
do something.

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.597
As soon as Chuck says what we're
gonna do, we're gonna do.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.297
What about her faggot-ass
little brother?

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:08.841
- ( Snorting )
- What about her brother?

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:10.103
You know what I think?

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:12.941
What did you say, Chuck?

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:19.478
I think she took my life,
and I wanna take hers.

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:21.281
Boy: Just like it says
in the Bible, man,

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:22.514
an eye for an eye.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.522
Clean this shit up
before my dad gets home.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.354
Okay-

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.393
( snorts )

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.532
I think we got enough
for the party.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:38.695
Two parties.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.811
- Come on. Go, go, go.
- Shit.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.076
Go.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.220
Lock the door.
Don't open it.

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:03.591
Hi, Dave.

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:06.233
What's with the ski masks?

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.663
Hitting the slopes?

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:10.600
You got lots of stuff
in the car.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.933
Are you going to some
big party or something?

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:16.009
It'll distract me
from my boredom.

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:21.715
How's that? Hmm?
That wake you up?

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:26.581
Are you still bored?

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.551
Where's C h rissie?

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:32.387
You tell me.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.453
That's the spirit.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:38.395
I want in that car.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.394
Guy, take this little
fucking scab out back.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.403
Teach him a lesson.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.806
( Dave screams )

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:49.799
Fuck!

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.468
Get him!

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:57.385
(screaming continues)

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.884
Tracy, open the door.

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:03.320
Tracy, you open that door,
and I will kill you personally.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.391
Leave him the fuck alone!

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.228
Fuck him up.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.830
( Screams )

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:11.624
- ( 5t0mps)
- 0oh!

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:15.395
God, Dave, it looks like
it hurts so bad!

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.834
Go and do it again.
One more time.

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.995
Okay, do it again.
Do it again.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.573
( Screams )

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:26.646
Leave him the fuck alone!
Leave him alone!

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.655
You tell Mom?

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.659
- Not yet.
- Good. Don't.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.422
I'm fine.
Let her have her time.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.997
She needs it.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.328
You know who these guys are
and yet you do nothing.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.437
We paid the boys a visit.
They were all nerves.

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:52.539
I could tell by their pupils
they were partying.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:53.936
That's great.
That's amazing.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:56.008
So what's next?
A lineup or something?

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.873
They were partying
in their homes.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:01.709
No contraband was visible and
our search warrant was rejected.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.350
So what are you saying?

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.713
We don't have enough
to arrest them yet.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.378
They broke his hand
in broad daylight.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.491
Line them up.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:13.719
Our hands are tied here,
Chrissie. I'm sorry.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:18.798
Please leave me with my brother.
Pleasejust go.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.161
Just go.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.973
This is all my fault.

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:30.475
There's good news.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.203
What's that?

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.508
I'm like a hero to Tracy now.

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.742
This is gonna go down
big for me.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.476
I'm gonna milk it.
Trust me.

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:40.382
It might even get me
a home run.

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.752
Hey, you all right?

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.187
( Dave echoing )
But we did get everything

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.728
we need for the party.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:53.595
We got beer, vodka,
tequila, cups.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:58.672
(distorted dialogue)

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:03.207
Don't worry.
I'll be okay.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:27.702
âª I have most of what I need âª

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.234
Guy: You don't know
who he is, do you?

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:33.238
âª I will be untidy âª

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:34.807
Chuck:
Hey, what is this?

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:39.276
<i>I</i> And I when I die,
I'll lay down âª

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.437
Chuck:
You're not a very nice girl.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:44.813
âª Yes, we like to do things
the hard way âª

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.282
- ( Click )
- Chrissie: What happened?

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:47.922
Ian: I was jumped.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.648
IAre we âª

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:54.591
âª The only ones alive? âª

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:55.991
(Click)

âª Us and the world collide âª

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:43.307
Charlie: See that fat
fucking beaner up there?

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:46.447
He just signed a guaranteed
hundred million-dollar contract.

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.810
Fucking...

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:54.680
Know what Dolphins' first-round
pick's getting this season?

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:58.189
- 7.6 million goddamn dollars.
- That's a lot of money.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.521
Yeah, that's a lot of
fucking money, isn't it?

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.823
You'll never find out.
That's for goddamn sure.

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:14.969
- ( Glass shatters )
- What the fuck is this?

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:16.371
Chuck: Fuck.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:17.841
Charlie: Is this
that Swanson girl?

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:19.878
Yeah.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.481
Chuck:
I need your help.

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.517
I need you to keep everyone away
from that fucking party.

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.381
Okay. Yeah.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.989

âª Well, you can say

âª Well, you can say

âª This feeling's out of control âª

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.395
âª It's going on and on

Dave: It felt like something
was creeping up behind me

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:25.435
and then nothing was there.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.774
I'll-- I'll call you
right back, okay?

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.307
You're security?

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:32.645
I almost feel bad fucking
your shit up all over again.

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:35.721
Not me. I've been dreaming about
fucking your shit up.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:37.220

Hmm? You scared now?

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.055
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.466
I'm sorry.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.829
No, you're not.

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:58.200
- I am.
- No, you're not!

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:02.867
Don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.638
( Bobby groaning )

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.880
I was thinking about
that dream you had.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.886
Don't lie to me.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.188
You're so beautiful.

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:23.139
Stay here.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.675

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:45.459
Are you okay?

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.897
Who taught you
how to shoot like that?

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:51.236
(cocks shotgun )

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:42.484

( police radio chatter)

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:59.037
Ian: So...

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:01.141
you just told the cops

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.208
that you took all those guys
down in self-defense,

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:04.845
and that's it?

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.639
And that's it.

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:13.181
You must be traumatized.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:16.721
I passed that phase yesterday.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:19.826
So let's do a head count.

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:21.484
Not the fucking curse again.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.290
Seriously,
have any seniors died yet?

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:27.297
Uh, not to my knowledge.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:30.062
So the curse
could still be real.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:33.139
Ian, we bring this on ourselves.

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:35.536
There's no curse.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.872
Some drunk senior
is probably about to drive

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:41.379
into a head-on with a semi
as we speak.

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.256
I should--
I should go check on Bobby.

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:54.054
You're a mess.
You need to chill for a sec.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.522
Remember we used
to push each other

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:59.529
to see who could
get highest?

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.729
Do you love grease boy?

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:08.501
Don't be a dick.
His name's Bobby.

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:10.405
Bobby doesn't deserve you.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.239
Ian...

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:16.445
Don't.

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.550
I've always loved you.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:51.111
- What happened?
- I was jumped.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.002
( Bell tolls)

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:24.811
Man: We pray to thee,
our God, this day.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:29.116
But from ashes to ashes
and dust to dust...

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:35.091
Chrissie: I feel for all
the people who grieve for me.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.256
And from where I stand,

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.490
I can say for sure
that I was wrong.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.333
The curse of
Downers Grove is real

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.438
because the curse
is everywhere.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:46.595
The curse is life.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.799
Man on TV:
Another graduation called off

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.204
and a funeral
to take its place...

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:54.508
Chrissie: Don't expect me
to tell you to believe in fate

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:58.675
or that there's some
supernatural force guiding us all.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.684
I can only say this.

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:02.845
It doesn't end here.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:07.017
âª When I walk into your eyes âª

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.653
âª I see the world âª

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:16.025
âª I'll take my time âª

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:21.301
âª To fall in love again âª

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:27.875
âª I've been trying
to sleep at night âª

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:31.678
âª But nothing works âª

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.845
âª I'll take my time âª

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:42.485
âª To fall in love again âª

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:49.392
âª When I walk âª

01:18:54.997 --> 01:19:00.208
âª When I walk âª

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:09.253
âª When I walk into your eyes âª

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:13.416
âª I see the world âª

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:18.696
âª I'll take my time âª

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:24.031
âª To fall in love again âª

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:30.471
âª I've been trying
to sleep at night âª

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:34.308
âª But nothing works âª

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:39.550
âª I'll take my time âª

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:44.885
âª To fall in love again âª

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:52.221
âª When I walk âª

01:19:57.726 --> 01:20:03.472
âª When I walk âª

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:34.532
âª When I walk âª

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:44.181
âª When I walk âª

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:38.227

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:19.568
(chanting continues)

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.612
Girl: Someone we know
is gonna die.

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:51.373
