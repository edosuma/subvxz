00:03.056 --> 00:04.560
Previously on ER...

00:04.577 --> 00:06.191
You got one week, Mike, one.

00:06.211 --> 00:08.402
I want you to know,
I really appreciate it.

00:08.413 --> 00:11.939
- You won't even know I'm there.
- There's just a lot of stuff going on.

00:12.491 --> 00:13.572
Gates?

00:13.924 --> 00:16.763
I want to sort it out.
I'm trying to sort it out.

00:16.777 --> 00:18.805
I just need a bit of time.

00:18.817 --> 00:22.858
I work on gay patients all the time.
I work with gay doctors.

00:23.585 --> 00:25.477
Greg, you're a lot more
like Dad than you realize.

00:25.487 --> 00:26.400
No...

00:28.304 --> 00:30.853
It's not coming out like I mean.

00:31.317 --> 00:34.643
- I sure hope someday you prove me wrong.
- Are you my dad or not?

00:34.714 --> 00:39.062
There's a simple test we can take.
It's called a paternity test, and, um...

00:40.019 --> 00:41.360
if you want...

00:41.998 --> 00:43.512
we can take it tonight.

00:49.476 --> 00:51.023
I'm in pain.
I've been here three hours.

00:51.046 --> 00:53.761
- Yeah, I'm sorry, sir, we're very busy.
- You haven't done crap for me.

00:53.778 --> 00:56.072
- I'll try to find a doctor.
- You said that an hour ago, bitch.

00:56.108 --> 00:57.750
You know what?
I'm doing the best I can,

00:57.778 --> 01:00.392
- so why don't you just settle down, okay?
- No, you settle down.

01:02.855 --> 01:05.000
Okay, so what went wrong?

01:06.716 --> 01:09.793
- She didn't stay calm.
- Her tone was threatening.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.392
She needed to keep her distance.

01:14.535 --> 01:15.910
You okay?

01:22.147 --> 01:23.341
All right, good.

01:23.967 --> 01:27.953
So let's review the key points
of managing assaultive behavior.

01:35.126 --> 01:36.670
I made coffee.

01:37.775 --> 01:38.951
Thanks.

01:39.145 --> 01:42.730
- That your history project?
- No, I'm paying the bills.

01:44.295 --> 01:47.063
You've been late three months
in a row on everything.

01:47.276 --> 01:49.530
I don't want them turning off
the electricity, okay?

01:49.585 --> 01:51.340
Is that my checkbook?
You take my checkbook?

01:51.367 --> 01:53.073
I'm just making them out,
you still have to sign.

01:53.266 --> 01:56.312
- Sweetie, I know you're trying to help.
- Good morning.

01:56.428 --> 01:59.840
- Hey. Nice outfit.
- Job interview.

02:00.325 --> 02:03.202
- What kind of job?
- Executive assistant.

02:03.215 --> 02:05.493
That's a fancy name
for answering the phone.

02:06.035 --> 02:07.991
Maybe he can help with the rent.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.020
We have $90 to get us
through the week.

02:17.108 --> 02:19.910
Look, if this thing comes through,
I'll be out of your hair in no time.

02:20.827 --> 02:22.041
Yeah, right.

02:22.238 --> 02:23.100
Hey.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.783
All right, shredded wheat or corn flakes?

02:26.825 --> 02:29.781
- So how you been?
- I've been all right.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.141
Hey, how about those Cubs, huh?

02:32.175 --> 02:34.440
Catch that game last night?
Some win.

02:35.325 --> 02:36.460
No.

02:39.077 --> 02:40.721
All right. Um...

02:43.787 --> 02:46.843
Okay, so you invite me to breakfast
to talk about baseball.

02:49.087 --> 02:50.603
No, it something else.

02:54.058 --> 02:55.802
I want to fix things.

02:55.988 --> 03:00.012
Neck! Knees! Nuts!

03:00.045 --> 03:02.090
Good, good.
All right, Lily.

03:03.295 --> 03:06.250
Now remember, the goal is
to diffuse violent behavior.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.690
This training is just a last resort.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.290
- Next.
- Come on, Sam. Go. Go.

03:12.436 --> 03:14.523
- Kick his ass, Sam!
- Go!

03:15.178 --> 03:16.503
You ready?

03:17.495 --> 03:18.820
Nose!

03:19.178 --> 03:22.341
- Come on, you can do better than that.
- Nuts!

03:23.245 --> 03:25.562
- Show me some strength.
- All right, I just don't want to hurt you.

03:25.575 --> 03:27.942
I've got enough padding
on to stop a tank.

03:28.297 --> 03:29.853
- Come on.
- Neck!

03:30.475 --> 03:32.101
I'm worried about you, Sam.

03:32.135 --> 03:34.492
Bad guys will rip a little
lady like you to shreds.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.412
- Oh, really, you think?
- Yeah, I know.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.883
Knee!

03:52.348 --> 03:54.593
I let you down.
I know that.

03:56.455 --> 04:00.693
But it doesn't matter what you want to do or
how you want to live, I'm still your brother.

04:01.468 --> 04:03.860
See, when I pushed you away, I messed up.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.441
But I can do better.
I think we both can.

04:09.577 --> 04:11.513
Look, it's just like when you moved in.

04:11.878 --> 04:15.252
You know, you... you could've been
a little bit more honest.

04:15.698 --> 04:18.420
You could've told me
what was really going on with you.

04:19.486 --> 04:21.070
I didn't know how to tell you.

04:22.158 --> 04:24.600
What, are you in some 12-step
program or something?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.872
No, man, it's just...

04:29.205 --> 04:31.910
I spent too many years pushing people away.

04:33.198 --> 04:35.292
I don't want to do that anymore.

04:39.305 --> 04:41.193
That mean you're going
to be talking to Dad?

04:43.595 --> 04:45.750
Let me work my way up to it.

04:47.928 --> 04:49.491
I'll give you that.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.460
- It's been five days.
- So?

04:56.507 --> 04:59.600
- So, fever without source freaks me out.
- It's a virus.

04:59.636 --> 05:02.562
Yeah, or it could be a serious infection
that we're missing.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.823
Look, he's playing well.
He's eating. Joe's not sick.

05:05.878 --> 05:08.373
Well, I'm going to check this,
just to make sure.

05:08.616 --> 05:10.083
- Abby...
- What?

05:10.315 --> 05:12.843
What? I got a little urine sample
this morning, so?

05:13.225 --> 05:14.501
Dr. Kovac.

05:14.795 --> 05:17.113
- Bad CHF, Trauma Two.
- Okay.

05:17.148 --> 05:21.470
- Uh, class over already?
- It ended a little early.

05:23.608 --> 05:24.830
You're being silly.

05:24.857 --> 05:28.291
If this were someone else's baby,
you'd tell them not to worry.

05:33.365 --> 05:35.203
All right, you're right.

05:35.408 --> 05:37.352
He probably just caught my cold.

- Hey, Timmy. You're back.
- And better than ever.

05:50.106 --> 05:52.310
Um, can you send this for a U.A.?

05:52.528 --> 05:54.693
- Uh, which patient?
- John Doe.

05:54.968 --> 05:56.841
A'ight, I'll take care of it.

05:58.145 --> 05:59.933
Officer Litchman needs a room.

06:00.466 --> 06:03.010
Curtain Two.
And hold for a chart.

06:03.138 --> 06:05.680
This is a nice move;
we were supposed to be off till noon.

06:05.687 --> 06:07.473
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

06:07.676 --> 06:09.902
Dislocated patella.
How'd that happen?

06:10.707 --> 06:13.933
He was teaching
the Assaultive Behavior Class.

06:14.007 --> 06:17.080
Nurse here got a little carried away.
Kicks like a mule.

06:17.257 --> 06:20.552
- You said bring it on.
- I wasn't expecting Bruce Lee.

06:21.777 --> 06:24.680
- So how long's this gonna take?
- Normally, all day.

06:24.706 --> 06:27.211
But under the circumstances, I'll try
to get you out in less than an hour.

06:27.308 --> 06:28.581
Yeah, right.

06:28.835 --> 06:31.882
I'll bet you a donut I can.

06:32.036 --> 06:34.290
Man, you sure know
how to get a cop excited.

06:36.176 --> 06:38.952
- Crackles to the apex.
- 40 of Lasix.

06:39.056 --> 06:42.582
- Feels like I'm drowning.
- Ever have fluid in your lungs?

06:43.285 --> 06:44.601
A heart attack?

06:44.676 --> 06:49.342
High blood pressure... high cholesterol.
Can someone call my dad?

06:50.638 --> 06:53.160
"Rutley and Son.
Heating and Air Conditioning."

06:53.208 --> 06:56.232
- Your dad still works?
- He lives with me. I...

06:56.276 --> 06:59.272
I moved my office home to look after him.

06:59.305 --> 07:01.521
BP's 195/120.

07:01.675 --> 07:04.900
- Okay, nitro drip at 40 mikes.
- What meds you on?

07:06.185 --> 07:08.593
Nothing? Nothing for your pressure?
Cholesterol?

07:08.607 --> 07:10.651
- Ran out.
- How long'd you go?

07:10.705 --> 07:14.542
Long time. Please call my dad.
He's expecting me.

07:14.617 --> 07:16.222
12 lits here.

07:16.738 --> 07:18.600
What about your doctor?
Who's your doctor?

07:18.857 --> 07:21.721
His name's on my insurance card.
I'll see him tomorrow.

07:21.807 --> 07:25.523
You're in congestive heart failure.
You need to be admitted to the ICU.

07:25.577 --> 07:29.283
I'm fine.
It's my dad I'm worried about.

07:31.238 --> 07:33.502
I was really bummed out about
the way we left things, too.

07:33.576 --> 07:35.472
Hey, man, I'm glad
you came down to meet me.

07:35.517 --> 07:37.931
You know, if you ever need anything,
I'm here for you.

07:38.267 --> 07:40.061
Actually, I could use a favor.

07:40.338 --> 07:42.512
I'm applying for a part-time job, and...

07:42.547 --> 07:44.350
it'd help if you could write
a letter or something.

07:44.375 --> 07:48.062
- Huh, what kind of work?
- An EMT at the fire department.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.233
Really?

07:49.317 --> 07:53.852
Yeah, money's good, flexible hours.
Perfect for a student.

07:53.957 --> 07:56.950
- EMT, huh?
- What's wrong with that?

07:57.374 --> 07:59.823
Well, you know, they're not
the most open-minded individuals,

07:59.907 --> 08:02.393
- if you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

08:02.964 --> 08:06.692
I mean, it's definitely a "don't ask,
don't tell" type of situation.

08:06.809 --> 08:09.790
I mean, if you're gonna fit in,
you got to just be one of the boys.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.953
Well, I know how to handle it.
And if it works out, who knows?

08:13.007 --> 08:15.123
Maybe I'll think about med school.

08:15.676 --> 08:16.842
Don't do it, man.

08:16.906 --> 08:19.232
Really? I see what you do.
It's good work.

08:20.207 --> 08:23.183
Really? So you're thinking
about emergency medicine, huh?

08:23.205 --> 08:25.351
Oh, hell, no.
Plastic surgery.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.631
If I'm going to put in all that work,
I need to make some coin.

08:31.186 --> 08:34.260
No, the swabs were sent in
three weeks ago.

08:34.888 --> 08:38.753
Anthony Gates, Sarah Riley.
Yes, I can hold.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.712
- Hey, trauma coming in?
- Crohn's fistula.

08:41.847 --> 08:44.841
- Paternity results never came back.
- How's Sarah holding up?

08:44.917 --> 08:46.951
She's all right, she just
doesn't want to talk about it.

08:47.107 --> 08:49.213
- Must be on her mind.
- She's moving on.

08:49.425 --> 08:52.021
Today she finds my checkbook,
pays all my bills.

08:52.106 --> 08:53.980
Really?
Maybe she can become a CPA.

08:54.018 --> 08:56.210
You know, when I was 12 years old,
I stood in line all day

08:56.246 --> 08:57.862
and waited for
The Return of the Jedi premiere.

08:57.918 --> 08:59.503
That's all I want her to do.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.293
- Be a Star Wars nerd?
- No, be a kid.

09:02.787 --> 09:06.172
No. They didn't come in the mail.
I didn't get them in the mail.

09:06.187 --> 09:07.881
Can you just tell me over the phone?

09:08.497 --> 09:10.452
- Gates.
- Fine. Send them again.

09:11.097 --> 09:12.973
- You okay? We'll catch up later?
- Yeah.

09:13.075 --> 09:16.171
- ICU said one hour.
- We're going to the cath lab.

09:16.377 --> 09:19.071
- Is he stable enough?
- Well, we'll stay with him.

09:19.278 --> 09:22.501
If they can open up an artery,
maybe it'll reverse his heart failure.

09:22.575 --> 09:25.703
- My dad.
- Yeah. We called him, he's on his way.

09:26.098 --> 09:29.182
I got 50,000 in mutual funds.

09:29.508 --> 09:31.852
- First National.
- Okay.

09:32.126 --> 09:34.322
See if his B.U.N.
and creatinine are back.

09:34.536 --> 09:35.610
Got it.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.100
Hey, Gates.
Hmm?

09:37.446 --> 09:40.222
Who do you know at the CFD
in the paramedic training program?

09:40.278 --> 09:41.390
Everyone.

09:41.488 --> 09:44.393
- Any of them actually like you?
- I'm popular everywhere I go.

09:44.415 --> 09:46.723
Hey, Sam, we need to check
a post-reduction film before he leaves.

09:46.776 --> 09:48.043
Yeah, we're just going to
the roach coach.

09:48.107 --> 09:51.340
- She owes me coffee.
- What? You owe me a donut.

09:52.468 --> 09:56.102
So let's say I had a friend
who wanted to be an EMT.

09:56.136 --> 09:59.200
Very tough, very competitive.
Lot of applicants.

09:59.275 --> 10:00.330
It's my brother.

10:00.375 --> 10:03.653
Your brother? Family?
Why didn't you say so? I'll be his hook.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.832
His what?

10:04.937 --> 10:08.013
Well, in City Fire, you need someone on
the inside to help you move up, you know?

10:08.107 --> 10:12.661
I'll help your brother out, no worries.
From now on, I'm his rabbi.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.673
What makes you think
I'm buying you coffee?

10:18.707 --> 10:20.593
It's the least you can do,
after you destroyed my knee.

10:20.617 --> 10:24.413
Oh, it's not even broken.
Your kneecap just slipped out of place.

10:24.518 --> 10:26.281
So where'd you learn moves like that?

10:26.338 --> 10:28.663
- In high school.
- That's a hell of a P.E. class.

10:28.708 --> 10:31.392
Yeah, took a little Muay Thai, some Krav.

10:32.177 --> 10:34.323
Yeah, I had to learn to protect myself.

10:34.407 --> 10:37.073
From the football players
who wanted a date to the prom?

10:37.357 --> 10:38.273
No.

10:38.336 --> 10:41.593
From the metal heads who wanted
a quickie behind the Dairy Queen.

10:41.927 --> 10:43.982
Damn, you know,
you're full of surprises.

10:44.947 --> 10:46.071
Sam!

10:49.577 --> 10:50.961
Move, move, move!

10:57.908 --> 10:59.710
- How's your guy?
- Good vitals.

10:59.828 --> 11:02.223
- What about the driver?
- Ask Bardelli.

11:02.277 --> 11:03.610
- Any neck pain?
- No.

11:03.647 --> 11:06.563
- Do not move.
- I'm okay. Ow! God!

11:06.768 --> 11:09.082
- I put my knee out again.
- Easy, fella.

11:11.115 --> 11:12.340
Is he altered?

11:12.816 --> 11:15.072
- Kind of hard to tell.
- Let's get him on a board.

11:16.378 --> 11:18.331
- Sam, open up a trauma room.
- Got it.

11:18.475 --> 11:20.611
That idiot came out of nowhere.
You think he's drunk?

11:20.635 --> 11:22.771
- I don't know.
- One, two, three.

11:24.188 --> 11:27.383
Sir, what's your name?
Do you speak English?

11:29.438 --> 11:32.060
- Got to assume he's altered.
- Yeah, pupils equal and reactive.

11:32.106 --> 11:33.350
Hey, guys...

11:34.005 --> 11:36.231
All right, let's start with
a trauma panel and a C-spine.

11:36.455 --> 11:37.703
Can you unlock the door?

11:38.008 --> 11:40.450
- I'll tape his head down.
- Look, just unlock the damn door!

11:40.478 --> 11:42.713
- What's the matter?
- Something's moving in there.

11:43.705 --> 11:45.820
- Two more victims.
- Oh, man!

11:46.325 --> 11:50.411
Looks like we got an adult male
and a little boy, both unconscious.

11:52.925 --> 11:55.170
Excuse me.
How much longer?

11:55.237 --> 11:58.420
- Your son's still up in the cath lab.
- So it'll be a while?

11:58.478 --> 11:59.982
It's hard to say.

12:00.195 --> 12:03.623
- Should I wait right here?
- Let's get a cup of coffee, Mr. Rutley.

12:03.705 --> 12:07.240
- We can try 1.25 of I.V. Enalopril.
- Okay.

12:07.496 --> 12:10.681
- Is that you, Danny?
- Yeah, I'm Dr. Kovac. Hi.

12:10.715 --> 12:12.592
Wayne Rutley.
What is all this?

12:12.635 --> 12:15.441
Uh, during the cath,
the fluid in his lungs got worse

12:15.458 --> 12:17.462
so we had to put a breathing tube
down his throat.

12:17.475 --> 12:21.053
- Are you having any pain?
- Sir, he can't talk with a tube in.

12:21.286 --> 12:23.122
- Are you a relative?
- A home health aide.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.502
- Is this a heart attack?
- It's a cardiomyopathy.

12:25.516 --> 12:28.400
- A what?
- His heart is squeezing very weakly.

12:28.507 --> 12:30.682
He's young.
He's got a good heart.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.901
He's had untreated high blood
pressure for a long time.

12:34.008 --> 12:37.553
He's always working.
He never gets to a doctor.

12:37.697 --> 12:40.640
- Been short of breath lately?
- I just met him today.

12:40.706 --> 12:44.103
Danny calls an agency
when he goes out to bid on a job.

12:44.137 --> 12:46.441
He... he thinks I need a baby-sitter.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.183
His eyesight's not so good,
and he has memory problems.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.531
Were they aluminum ducts?

12:51.755 --> 12:55.312
I told you, you need
galvanized sheet metal.

12:55.378 --> 12:59.030
Tight wheezing, he's barely moving air.
Trauma One, let's get Gates on this.

12:59.077 --> 13:01.223
- Head lac, good vitals.
- Okay.

13:04.006 --> 13:06.442
- Little guy's concussed. GCS 14.
- Okay, good.

13:06.478 --> 13:08.081
Exam Two, both of them.

13:09.806 --> 13:11.243
Might take a little longer this time.

13:11.277 --> 13:13.022
Yeah, I know.
Some of the others look pretty bad.

13:13.078 --> 13:16.213
Hey, next time we go out, I'm driving.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.290
- Does anybody know what language this is?
- Sounds like Farsi, maybe?

13:23.315 --> 13:26.411
- Kid needs a line.
- Grab a buretrol from Trauma.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.143
Hey, take some deep breaths, okay?
Give the medicine a chance to work.

13:31.225 --> 13:34.010
Hey, Bards, Cap Mahoney still with 43's?

13:34.075 --> 13:36.770
- Had pancakes with him this morning.
- Have him check his e-mail.

13:36.907 --> 13:39.852
- You picking up shifts?
- No, it's about an EMT applicant.

13:40.037 --> 13:43.180
Cap Mahoney's on the EMT selection
committee. Key player.

13:43.425 --> 13:45.761
- Hey, Pratt, what am I missing?
- Uh, tight asthma.

13:45.778 --> 13:48.771
He might be biting plastic soon.
Everyone else is stable.

13:48.808 --> 13:50.210
Dr. Kovac!

13:52.578 --> 13:54.673
V fib, paddles are charged.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.262
What happened?

13:56.616 --> 13:57.890
Clear.

14:01.126 --> 14:02.772
Normal sinus.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.472
- Got a pulse.
- Thank God.

14:08.767 --> 14:12.340
- Is your son married?
- He never met the right girl.

14:12.375 --> 14:16.372
- And your wife?
- She passed in '82.

14:18.008 --> 14:20.072
You're doing better, Danny.

14:21.298 --> 14:22.723
Open your eyes.

14:24.055 --> 14:27.301
- 90/65.
- Up the Dopamine.

14:30.365 --> 14:34.333
Hang in there, pal.
Hang in there.

14:40.076 --> 14:43.082
- More cricoid.
- Sats are dropping. Pull out.

14:43.228 --> 14:46.190
- His cords are way anterior.
- He's getting harder to bag.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.973
- Kid's starting to open his eyes.
- Okay, good.

14:50.038 --> 14:52.662
- Look, I need an ET view now.
- All right, be right there.

14:54.575 --> 14:57.392
- Head CT's clear on flower guy.
- Oh, good news.

14:59.227 --> 15:02.432
- You need a Farsi translator?
- Oh, yeah. He's got a head injury,

15:02.467 --> 15:04.762
so he... he might be disoriented.

15:11.667 --> 15:15.283
He doesn't speak Farsi.
I think that's Armenian. Sorry.

15:15.318 --> 15:17.812
Any Armenian nurses up there?

15:21.846 --> 15:24.073
Hey, that's him.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.321
- Hey, how do you know this guy?
- He saved us.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.450
Where's my brother?

15:32.028 --> 15:34.403
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:35.206 --> 15:37.002
Julio, it's me, Tomas!

15:37.036 --> 15:38.802
- You got to move it to the right.
- That better?

15:38.836 --> 15:40.271
- No.
- He has asthma.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.740
- Yeah, we figured that part out.
- They're brothers.

15:42.955 --> 15:45.461
- So how'd this happen?
- We were going to the drugstore.

15:45.507 --> 15:47.833
He couldn't walk.
Then he couldn't talk.

15:47.875 --> 15:51.010
The guy with the flowers threw us
in the back and drove to the hospital.

15:51.036 --> 15:53.060
So Yakov over there is
the Good Samaritan.

15:53.075 --> 15:55.020
Aw, damn it!
Bag him up!

15:55.077 --> 15:57.931
He dropped his spray, if you need it.
Okay, come on, Tomas.

15:57.975 --> 16:00.533
- There's a better place to wait.
- I want to stay with my brother.

16:00.555 --> 16:02.593
Yeah, but it's okay.
We'll be back in a few minutes, okay?

16:02.605 --> 16:05.830
- You want to try fiber optic?
- Nope, I want Sam.

16:06.076 --> 16:08.192
- I got a guy who's not breathing.
- Okay, I can wait.

16:08.215 --> 16:09.601
I'll be there soon.

16:11.116 --> 16:12.250
Got everything.

16:13.057 --> 16:14.441
Pulse ox 89.

16:14.478 --> 16:15.820
All right, sats are good enough to tube, huh?

16:15.856 --> 16:17.903
No, I want a cushion.
Let's get him up to 95.

16:17.938 --> 16:19.351
All right, we'll wait.

16:21.107 --> 16:23.113
There's a little tiny camera
at the end of this tube.

16:23.267 --> 16:25.182
- You're all set.
- All right, slow down, Lily.

16:25.206 --> 16:27.240
He's got a long expiratory phase.

16:27.378 --> 16:30.493
Hey, I can get a copy of last
year's EMT exam for your brother.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.693
- Good.
- We're up to 92.

16:32.776 --> 16:34.552
All right, grab
an end tidal detector, will you?

16:34.578 --> 16:36.581
Also, we'll find out
who's doing the interview.

16:36.608 --> 16:40.562
You know, find out his hobbies, his
favorite sports team, stuff like that.

16:40.608 --> 16:43.292
- All right, we're up to 95.
- All right, cool.

16:44.126 --> 16:45.852
Is it okay if I do this?

16:47.188 --> 16:48.990
- I'll give you one shot.
- All right.

16:49.116 --> 16:51.142
- Need a laryngoscope?
- Yeah. - No.

16:51.205 --> 16:52.511
- No.
- Just watch the screen.

16:52.536 --> 16:54.372
- And pass it through the cords.
- Right. I knew that.

16:54.406 --> 16:55.762
All right, come on.
Let's go.

17:00.507 --> 17:03.343
All right, taste buds...

17:03.595 --> 17:06.723
tonsils... epiglottis...

17:07.068 --> 17:10.242
- and the promised land.
- Straight shot through the cords.

17:10.377 --> 17:14.230
All right, bingo. Stopping short
of the carina, and bag him.

17:14.276 --> 17:15.242
Nice.

17:15.275 --> 17:17.473
Looks like Kovac
could use a hand in there.

17:17.765 --> 17:20.579
Oh, yeah. Doesn't look so good.
All right, thanks for letting me do this.

17:20.605 --> 17:22.652
This was a good thing for me to learn.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.352
V fib.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.553
- Can you take over compressions?
- No problem.

17:27.627 --> 17:29.701
Okay, another amp of epi.
Charge to 360.

17:29.778 --> 17:32.773
Good. Shock him.
It worked before.

17:32.988 --> 17:34.322
Clear.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.100
Still in fib.

17:38.385 --> 17:41.060
Mr. Rutley, we're not
making much progress here.

17:41.117 --> 17:43.243
- What's that supposed to mean?
- His heart is too weak.

17:43.275 --> 17:44.993
It's not responding to our medicine.

17:45.017 --> 17:48.122
- You, you're not giving up?
- No, we're not giving up.

17:48.157 --> 17:51.200
I just need you to understand
that it's not looking good.

17:51.427 --> 17:53.383
You're saying he could die?

17:53.747 --> 17:58.243
- It's a possibility, sir.
- Oh, he's, he's my son.

17:58.905 --> 18:02.271
He's my little boy.
Don't leave me, Danny.

18:02.427 --> 18:05.690
- Call the social worker.
- Don't leave me!

18:09.956 --> 18:11.790
Don't leave me!

18:13.406 --> 18:15.431
I'm in pain.
I've been here for three hours.

18:15.468 --> 18:17.650
- I'm sorry.
- You haven't done crap for me.

18:17.676 --> 18:21.751
- Oh, don't start that again.
- Look where it got me last time.

18:23.995 --> 18:26.621
All the docs are busy.
I need an order for I.V. sedation.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.990
- Can't you pop it in?
- Without painkillers?

18:29.007 --> 18:31.040
I've been shot before.
I can handle it.

18:31.118 --> 18:34.330
- Uh, I think a doctor should do it.
- Come on, Sam, don't be a wimp.

18:34.378 --> 18:36.950
Just pop this baby back
in place, so we...

18:40.216 --> 18:44.123
Hey, hey, tough guy?
Wake up.

18:46.607 --> 18:48.053
Asystole.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.061
Resuming compressions.

18:51.638 --> 18:54.280
Mr. Rutley, it's been 45 minutes.

18:54.476 --> 18:58.060
- Should a cardiologist see him?
- They'd do the same thing.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.183
It's too late.

19:01.936 --> 19:03.000
No!

19:04.745 --> 19:07.820
- No, no!
- We're gonna stop now. I'm sorry.

19:08.875 --> 19:09.990
Danny...

19:11.767 --> 19:14.993
Danny! Oh, my God!

19:16.176 --> 19:18.052
Oh, my God!

19:18.718 --> 19:20.930
What am I gonna do?!

19:21.235 --> 19:24.030
Sir, there's a social worker here that can help you.

19:24.117 --> 19:26.141
How could this happen?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.750
How could this happen?!

19:29.376 --> 19:31.850
How could this happen?!

19:33.628 --> 19:35.682
I'll do the coroner's paperwork.

19:46.755 --> 19:49.222
I'll make sure he's taken care of.

19:59.935 --> 20:01.591
How's the X-ray look?
Good?

20:01.616 --> 20:06.302
Ah, well, he might have a small pneumo.
Call Radiology for a wet read.

20:06.378 --> 20:09.691
- How long's he going to sleep?
- Mm, might be a while.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.083
After he wakes up, we can go home?

20:12.278 --> 20:15.033
Well, you know, he's gonna have
to be here for a couple days.

20:15.177 --> 20:16.553
Can I stay with him?

20:16.576 --> 20:18.353
Yeah, but you're gonna have
to go home at night.

20:18.407 --> 20:21.381
- By myself?
- No, we're calling your parents.

20:21.648 --> 20:24.022
No, it's just us.

20:24.108 --> 20:26.660
Ever since Mom died,
Julio's my guardian.

20:27.615 --> 20:29.682
You don't have any aunts or uncles?

20:31.677 --> 20:34.723
Okay, we'll figure it out, and
you can hang out here for now.

20:35.077 --> 20:38.612
- All right?
- Good. I'm staying with you, J.

20:38.845 --> 20:40.772
I'm gonna stay right here.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.041
- Hey, tough guy, wake up.
- You need a doctor?

20:46.107 --> 20:47.901
Uh, no, he just vagalled.

20:47.916 --> 20:50.882
- I'll check his vitals in a few minutes.
- Abby, urine's clean on John Doe.

20:51.008 --> 20:54.202
Oh, great. No leucs, no nitrates.
Thank you.

20:54.238 --> 20:56.850
Hey, Timmy, repeat knee on Litchman.

20:57.525 --> 21:01.380
Okay, wait. How does a ten-day
cruise turn into two months?

21:01.736 --> 21:04.562
- Gracie will fill you in.
- Yeah, she's not talking.

21:04.767 --> 21:05.782
Okay.

21:05.818 --> 21:08.922
After we docked in Singapore,
I showed her some of my old haunts.

21:09.227 --> 21:12.091
We climbed the temples of Penang,
we cycled the Quang Ninh coast

21:12.115 --> 21:13.992
and we elephant-trekked
through the Ratanakiri.

21:14.017 --> 21:15.373
- Elephants?
- Yeah.

21:15.398 --> 21:17.550
In fact, we got hung up
at the Cambodian border,

21:17.578 --> 21:20.733
and we'd still be there if Gracie
hadn't tapped into her 401K.

21:21.237 --> 21:23.141
That's too much information.

21:23.387 --> 21:25.223
Hey, Miranda, how's he doing?

21:26.207 --> 21:27.801
102?

21:28.336 --> 21:30.242
Well, did you give him the Tylenol...?

21:30.585 --> 21:33.681
Okay, well, call me after his nap. Bye.

21:33.976 --> 21:37.040
No relatives,
no long-term care insurance.

21:37.108 --> 21:40.183
The guy worked all day, took care of his
dad all night, but didn't plan for this.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.103
Take-home lesson? Don't assume
you're gonna outlive your dad.

21:43.155 --> 21:46.422
Abby, Pratt says you need
social work for your asthma kid.

21:46.476 --> 21:48.860
- Thanks.
- Gates, don't get too busy.

21:48.905 --> 21:51.083
There's a guy out in the lobby
looking for you.

21:56.157 --> 21:59.121
- Hey, I thought we could grab lunch.
- You have five minutes.

21:59.906 --> 22:01.772
- How'd the interview go?
- Not so great.

22:01.795 --> 22:03.591
Not so great.
You didn't get the job, right?

22:03.606 --> 22:06.450
- No.
- What happened?

22:06.688 --> 22:08.640
- Well...
- What?!

22:09.618 --> 22:13.423
I don't know anything about Word.
And what the hell's Excel?

22:13.575 --> 22:15.131
So it wasn't a good fit.

22:15.477 --> 22:18.253
Since when do you need a computer
to do a day's work, huh?

22:18.305 --> 22:21.251
What about, uh, Chuck Mooney's
construction company?

22:21.305 --> 22:22.310
He sold it.

22:22.377 --> 22:25.210
What about, uh, what's his name?
Your friend, Billy Prior's restaurant?

22:25.306 --> 22:27.652
Turned it into a yoga studio.

22:28.546 --> 22:30.650
- Something will come up hopefully.
- No.

22:31.008 --> 22:33.403
You know, actually you can...
you can help me out tonight.

22:33.457 --> 22:35.583
I don't want Sarah cooking.
Why don't you, uh...

22:35.828 --> 22:38.571
why don't you go to the grocery
store, get some groceries,

22:38.828 --> 22:41.802
- and, uh, cook dinner tonight?
- I can't take your money.

22:41.836 --> 22:44.243
Just do it. You used to love to cook
at the firehouse, right?

22:44.305 --> 22:46.473
- You loved cooking.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.921
I could do a chicken pot pie.

22:49.488 --> 22:51.163
- Maybe a London broil.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:51.207 --> 22:53.992
- The boys always liked my London Broil...
- Surprise me. Surprise me.

23:02.697 --> 23:06.290
Patients are in the hall, Abby.
Water pipe burst.

23:08.576 --> 23:09.821
Okay.

23:10.828 --> 23:14.733
- Um, Rose Nichols?
- That's me.

23:15.247 --> 23:16.561
Hello.

23:17.476 --> 23:19.402
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

23:19.776 --> 23:22.600
- Let's see... fever and a cough.
- For almost a week.

23:22.637 --> 23:24.370
Okay.
How you feeling?

23:24.605 --> 23:27.931
- I'm a little under the weather.
- Yeah, well...

23:28.006 --> 23:31.053
There's a lot of colds going around,
and sometimes it takes a couple of weeks,

23:31.077 --> 23:33.801
but kids usually get over it.

23:37.486 --> 23:38.882
81?

23:40.465 --> 23:43.053
Maybe we're not getting a proper signal.

23:43.158 --> 23:44.920
Let me see.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.160
- Uh-oh.
- What?

23:57.075 --> 24:00.560
Sounds like pneumonia.
And her oxygen level is really low.

24:00.585 --> 24:03.001
So I think we're going
to have to admit you.

24:03.056 --> 24:06.382
Everyone said she was fine,
but I knew it was more than a cold.

24:08.836 --> 24:10.471
Okay, he's cleared for discharge.

24:12.907 --> 24:15.010
- How are the boys?
- Oh, they're doing well.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.590
- What?
- He's asking you for a date.

24:23.616 --> 24:28.002
Oh, well, we'll repeat the head CT.
I think he's still altered.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.452
I didn't know you were here.

24:39.705 --> 24:40.913
Yeah, I just got here.

24:40.977 --> 24:43.480
- Ah, it's lots of trauma today.
- I heard.

24:43.856 --> 24:46.680
The guys from my old band-- they're
playing this Saturday night at Exit.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.902
I might be on call.

24:49.475 --> 24:51.692
- So we're still waiting?
- It's only been a week.

24:51.718 --> 24:54.891
Okay. I'm gonna go clear
some of these beds, all right?

24:55.126 --> 24:56.302
See ya.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.221
Sarah...

25:01.275 --> 25:03.991
- Have you seen Tony?
- Well, I can look around.

25:04.288 --> 25:06.481
- No, I'll wait.
- Okay.

25:08.995 --> 25:11.000
Or maybe you can help me.

25:12.156 --> 25:13.190
Sure.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.211
It's kind of personal.

25:19.397 --> 25:20.592
Okay, come on.

25:21.226 --> 25:23.860
- I need a vaccine.
- Which one?

25:24.118 --> 25:28.230
- HPV. To prevent cervical cancer.
- Right.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.641
But the school nurse gives it,

25:32.675 --> 25:36.111
and you need your parents' permission
or your grandparents' permission.

25:36.195 --> 25:37.901
They wouldn't understand.

25:38.567 --> 25:41.421
- Does Tony know about this?
- Not yet.

25:42.035 --> 25:44.513
- You gonna tell him?
- No.

25:45.407 --> 25:46.951
It's private.

25:49.347 --> 25:52.071
It's okay.
I mean, you can tell him.

25:53.366 --> 25:54.793
If you want to.

25:55.477 --> 25:57.680
Why didn't you go to your pediatrician?

25:59.787 --> 26:01.612
He only takes care of little kids.

26:01.776 --> 26:04.590
Besides, I think I need
a new doctor anyway.

26:04.876 --> 26:06.731
Do you know a good GYN?

26:07.465 --> 26:08.912
So you can't place him?

26:08.936 --> 26:10.970
The best I can hope for
is a crappy nursing home

26:11.006 --> 26:12.920
that'll except $100 a day from Medicaid.

26:13.007 --> 26:16.132
He's not sick enough for a nursing home.
He needs assisted living.

26:16.207 --> 26:18.892
Neither Medicaid nor Medicare will
cover that. And he can't afford it.

26:18.916 --> 26:22.102
- What about the son's assets?
- They'll be tied up in probate for a year.

26:22.185 --> 26:25.092
I've tried three board and cares.
They want cash... today.

26:25.177 --> 26:28.431
Greedy bastards.
But we've got a bigger problem.

26:28.507 --> 26:31.753
I'm not sure he's competent to consent
to nursing home placement.

26:31.815 --> 26:33.442
He didn't seem that altered.

26:34.045 --> 26:36.283
His Alzheimer's gets worse
as the day goes on.

26:36.317 --> 26:37.472
Sundowning...

26:37.767 --> 26:41.002
We need someone with durable power
for his health care decisions.

26:41.038 --> 26:43.381
The son had it.
A lot of good that does us now.

26:43.417 --> 26:45.993
We're scrambling to get
an emergency state guardian.

26:46.196 --> 26:49.003
Hey, any luck finding
a Foster Home for Tomas?

26:49.038 --> 26:51.803
- Piece of cake compared to this.
- Dr. Pratt.

26:52.137 --> 26:55.841
- You called for a wet read?
- Uh, yes, I did. A possible pneumo.

26:55.876 --> 26:57.250
Excuse me, please.

26:59.446 --> 27:01.081
I haven't seen you in a few weeks.

27:01.116 --> 27:04.540
I was doing an invasive
fellowship in Dallas.

27:04.876 --> 27:07.592
- For six months.
- Really?

27:07.828 --> 27:11.420
- Well, I sent you a few e-mails.
- Never got any of them.

27:11.718 --> 27:13.400
Well, you must have changed your address.

27:13.435 --> 27:19.360
I've had the same address for seven years.
So, you think there's some pathology here?

27:21.447 --> 27:23.492
Palpitations like
your heart skipping a beat?

27:23.517 --> 27:25.480
More like it races
every now and then.

27:25.515 --> 27:26.993
Hey, Ray, can I get you
to look at a knee?

27:27.007 --> 27:28.582
Yeah. Excuse me.

27:28.726 --> 27:30.912
- It's happening!
- Get the crash cart.

27:31.006 --> 27:34.243
- My chest is going to explode!
- He's got a pulse. 100 of lido.

27:34.276 --> 27:38.563
- Anything surgical?
- Uh, stable V tach.

27:41.138 --> 27:43.763
- Responding to lidocaine.
- Ah, that's better.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.451
Well, I guess you won't be
needing me, then.

27:45.505 --> 27:49.131
A milligram a minute.
Titrate up. P.R.N. ectopy.

27:50.605 --> 27:53.372
I left a consult on your asthma guy
from the crash.

27:53.406 --> 27:54.293
Thanks.

27:54.538 --> 27:56.382
Did you know Sarah was here?

27:56.478 --> 28:00.153
- She's asking for the HPV vaccine.
- You're kidding me?

28:00.276 --> 28:03.233
- Does that mean she's...?
- No. We didn't get that far.

28:03.576 --> 28:05.542
She wants the whole world
to know how grown up she is.

28:05.578 --> 28:08.670
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just a phase that girls go through.

28:08.707 --> 28:10.340
- Gates!
- Coming.

28:10.556 --> 28:11.850
Good luck.

28:14.676 --> 28:16.983
Thanks for your help.
I'll hold.

28:17.216 --> 28:20.790
It's a miracle. We got a guardian assigned
and two nursing homes to choose from.

28:20.836 --> 28:22.250
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28:22.375 --> 28:24.510
Think he'll be able to decide
which one he wants to go to?

28:24.555 --> 28:25.930
Let's hope so.

28:34.097 --> 28:38.101
- Hello, Mr. Rutley.
- Hello. Uh... When am I leaving?

28:38.137 --> 28:40.543
Well, that's what we're here
to talk to you about.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.372
What's there to talk about?

28:42.475 --> 28:45.390
We've found a couple of places
that can take you tonight.

28:45.435 --> 28:46.930
What kind of places?

28:46.978 --> 28:50.101
- Convalescent homes.
- Oh... I have a home.

28:50.177 --> 28:54.023
Well, you're going to need help
now getting around... meals.

28:54.477 --> 28:59.451
No, I have help, I have meals.
We eat dinner at 7:00.

28:59.575 --> 29:02.541
Somebody ought to call Danny--
tell him we're going to be late.

29:12.057 --> 29:16.192
Wayne... you know about Danny.

29:18.036 --> 29:19.413
Remember?

29:21.927 --> 29:24.913
Sure. He went out to bid
on a job this morning.

29:25.007 --> 29:26.793
He ought to be home by now.

29:32.737 --> 29:36.873
Wayne, you know Danny
was in this hospital today.

29:39.758 --> 29:41.290
What? Danny?

29:41.336 --> 29:45.091
- Nah, Danny's not sick.
- He had a heart problem.

29:46.596 --> 29:47.741
What?

29:49.687 --> 29:52.202
Nobody told me anything about that.

29:54.276 --> 29:56.832
His heart stopped beating.

29:57.735 --> 30:01.090
We worked on him for over an hour.

30:01.618 --> 30:03.342
Where is he?

30:04.355 --> 30:07.932
I... He's better now?

30:12.337 --> 30:15.892
He died, Wayne.
Danny's dead.

30:17.466 --> 30:18.742
No.

30:19.626 --> 30:20.930
No!

30:21.665 --> 30:24.690
No, I don't believe it.
That's not possible.

30:25.438 --> 30:27.792
Where is he? I want to see him.
Where is he?

30:27.877 --> 30:30.183
He's, uh... he's in the morgue, Mr. Rutley.

30:30.215 --> 30:33.242
What?
Take me there.

30:34.818 --> 30:36.771
Take me there.

30:38.626 --> 30:40.560
Take me to my son.

30:41.206 --> 30:46.161
Please, please, I want... I want
to see him. I need to see him.

30:46.236 --> 30:48.503
I want to say good-bye.

30:50.038 --> 30:53.290
Recomand starting the HPV
vaccine when you're 11.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.382
All right, we need to talk about this.

30:55.806 --> 30:58.793
- Okay, let's talk.
- HPV is a sexually trans...

30:58.808 --> 31:00.880
I'm not having sex, okay?

31:01.506 --> 31:03.871
But when I do,
I want to be responsible...

31:03.888 --> 31:06.113
Even if I said yes,
your grandparents have to sign off on...

31:06.138 --> 31:08.641
Do you realize how stupid
this is, though?

31:08.716 --> 31:11.483
I'm old enough to go
and get birth control on my own,

31:11.576 --> 31:14.882
but you won't let me go and get
a vaccine that could save my life.

31:15.005 --> 31:16.751
Sarah, you're 12 years old.

31:17.205 --> 31:19.743
- Yeah, I know.
- What's the rush?

31:20.115 --> 31:23.953
I'm not rushing. But I can't help
it if I'm growing up now, can I?

31:24.186 --> 31:26.441
Need you to fill out transfer
papers for Mr. Rutley.

31:26.477 --> 31:29.792
All right, I'll be there in a second.
Can we continue this at home, please?

31:30.017 --> 31:33.112
- So I can't get it now?
- Not today.

31:33.616 --> 31:35.411
That's so unfair.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.290
All right, we got you five days off work.

31:41.378 --> 31:43.600
Hmm, I have a self-defense
seminar tomorrow.

31:43.637 --> 31:46.941
- Want to fill in?
- Oh, crap. V tach again!

31:47.008 --> 31:48.390
- It's the third time.
- I need Ray.

31:48.416 --> 31:51.383
I'm on lidocaine and amiodarone.
Shouldn't I be in the ICU?

31:54.266 --> 31:55.790
Have you been faking this
this whole time?

31:55.816 --> 31:57.401
No, I had an itch.

31:57.698 --> 32:00.533
What's going on, Sam?
What are you doing?

32:00.956 --> 32:04.441
- Is it his heart?
- No, it's his finger.

32:11.688 --> 32:13.812
- V tach again.
- Sam...

32:14.025 --> 32:17.472
- It's a shockable rhythm.
- Shockable? Uh, no.

32:17.725 --> 32:19.442
- Clear!
- No...

32:20.837 --> 32:23.052
- Crazy bitch!
- Yeah, you're the crazy one.

32:23.105 --> 32:26.531
- Sam, have you lost your mind?
- Come on, it's only ten joules.

32:26.607 --> 32:27.681
Really?

32:27.687 --> 32:32.351
Oh! Yeah, I guess that's not so bad.

32:36.875 --> 32:39.372
It's called a negative Mach band.

32:39.487 --> 32:43.063
Looks like something's there, but
it's not. Doesn't even exist.

32:44.196 --> 32:48.083
It's a retinal phenomenon.
The eye is fooled at a light-dark junction.

32:48.176 --> 32:51.533
Always something new to learn.
Glad you're back. Thanks for the help.

32:51.605 --> 32:53.132
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:53.247 --> 32:57.001
How 'bout, um...
we grab some dinner sometime after work?

32:57.235 --> 32:59.523
Maybe. Call me.

33:00.255 --> 33:03.402
Danny.
Pick up the phone, son.

33:03.745 --> 33:06.710
- If you can hear me, pick up the phone.
- Uh, you...

33:06.778 --> 33:08.651
- Oh. Is this one yours?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:08.676 --> 33:11.173
I don't like leaving messages
on the machine.

33:11.215 --> 33:12.673
Mr. Rutley, let's get you back
to your room.

33:12.707 --> 33:14.870
I need to call my son.
He doesn't know I'm here.

33:14.985 --> 33:16.003
Please.

33:19.378 --> 33:22.870
Guys... hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Knock it off!

33:23.515 --> 33:26.113
I-I'm sorry. I-I'm upset.

33:26.356 --> 33:28.912
My brother--
he totaled my van!

33:29.008 --> 33:30.841
Yes, but aren't you happy that he's okay?

33:30.877 --> 33:33.291
Without van, my business is dead!

33:33.815 --> 33:37.603
- All because he drives like madman!
- Sir, he saved someone's life.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.793
What are you talking about?

33:43.346 --> 33:46.483
He was speeding because
he had a sick patient in the back.

34:02.637 --> 34:05.420
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

34:17.636 --> 34:18.860
- Hey, Pratt.
- Yeah.

34:18.906 --> 34:21.031
- I need you to sign the discharge.
- All right.

34:21.107 --> 34:23.739
- You got any questions, man?
- Yeah, can I go out on crutches?

34:24.114 --> 34:26.860
It's hospital policy.
Wheelchair is safer.

34:27.547 --> 34:30.282
- Oh, all right, I'll make an exception.
- All right.

34:38.106 --> 34:41.351
Hey, Joe.
Hey, how you feeling?

34:41.375 --> 34:43.042
I missed you. Hello.

34:43.105 --> 34:45.553
His temp's down,
but he didn't want the bottle.

34:45.574 --> 34:48.000
- Oh, my God, look how big he's getting.
- Yeah.

34:48.567 --> 34:51.362
- You need me to stay?
- No, thanks. Have a good night.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.442
- Hey, Sam, is Exam Two open?
- Uh, yeah.

34:56.594 --> 35:01.483
Oh, look. This is where Mommy works.
Look. Greg, I need a favor.

35:01.685 --> 35:03.011
Okay.

35:06.538 --> 35:10.251
- You're taking me home?
- You're going to a nursing home.

35:10.447 --> 35:14.502
- No, those places are for old folks.
- That's where you're going to live.

35:14.518 --> 35:18.073
No, I told you, I live with my son.

35:24.235 --> 35:25.882
Mr. Rutley...

35:27.358 --> 35:32.061
- I, I spoke to your son.
- Oh. Is he, is he picking me up?

35:32.826 --> 35:36.220
- He wants you at the new place.
- He does?

35:36.366 --> 35:38.171
Is he gonna be there?

35:39.358 --> 35:41.672
I'm sure he'll, he'll find a way.

35:41.888 --> 35:46.512
- So... so we can have dinner together?
- If that's what you want.

35:46.965 --> 35:48.942
Eh, I guess it's okay.

35:49.746 --> 35:52.570
Tell him I won't start eating
till he gets there.

35:52.605 --> 35:54.432
Hey, Luka, I'll be right with you.

35:55.868 --> 35:58.133
Well, all right, Officer.

35:58.335 --> 36:01.783
- You're on your own.
- Thanks, Sam. You've been great.

36:02.045 --> 36:04.623
I think your day might have been
a whole lot better if you never met me.

36:04.657 --> 36:06.211
Not so sure about that.

36:06.436 --> 36:09.140
- Hope I see you around.
- Yeah.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.283
- You need a pen?
- Uh...

36:18.677 --> 36:20.260
Oh, oh, see?

36:21.178 --> 36:23.092
"Rutley and Son.

36:23.508 --> 36:26.063
Since 1959."

36:26.748 --> 36:28.002
Well. Thank you.

36:29.276 --> 36:31.782
When we started, it was just me.

36:34.456 --> 36:39.003
Now Danny's got four guys working for him.

36:39.835 --> 36:44.532
He's a good kid. Hmm...
I'm a lucky guy.

36:44.678 --> 36:46.671
- Take care, Mr. Rutley.
- Yeah.

36:53.975 --> 36:55.973
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

36:58.555 --> 37:01.533
Are you, uh... still in touch with your father?

37:02.255 --> 37:05.173
- Not since I was three.
- You?

37:05.207 --> 37:08.152
He's in Croatia.
I haven't been there in a long time.

37:09.747 --> 37:11.082
Hey!

37:11.617 --> 37:14.152
- What's for dinner?
- Spaghetti.

37:14.616 --> 37:16.503
There's more in the pot.

37:20.537 --> 37:23.432
- I'll go shopping after dinner, okay?
- I don't think so.

37:23.748 --> 37:26.363
- We have to eat.
- Come on, Sarah, I know what you're doing.

37:26.408 --> 37:28.892
- What?!
- Cooking, shopping, paying the bills.

37:28.916 --> 37:31.302
- Somebody has to.
- I want you to be a kid.

37:31.338 --> 37:34.892
- Please, just enjoy being a kid, okay?
- Right. I forgot.

37:35.188 --> 37:38.340
I'm supposed to text my friends all day
and hang out at the mall, right?

37:38.375 --> 37:40.901
- What's wrong with that?
- I like taking care of the house.

37:40.938 --> 37:43.290
- Just let me do it.
- When you become older,

37:43.308 --> 37:45.751
you'll have plenty of responsibility.
Trust me.

37:45.976 --> 37:51.291
Hey... Smells pretty good in here.
What is that, lasagna?

37:53.376 --> 37:55.053
Where are the groceries, Mike?

37:55.355 --> 38:00.201
Oh, shoot.
I knew I forgot something.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.962
Right. Sarah, go do your homework.

38:02.006 --> 38:04.171
- I'm not finished yet.
- Now!

38:05.295 --> 38:07.080
- I gave you a hundred dollars.
- I know.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.150
- For food. How much you got left?
- I don't know.

38:09.206 --> 38:12.240
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet!

38:15.876 --> 38:18.373
Six bucks?
Six bucks?!

38:18.415 --> 38:23.242
Well, it was Lou Sanders' birthday,
and so I bought a couple of rounds.

38:28.757 --> 38:31.610
- No otitis, no pharyngitis, no nothing.
- You sure?

38:31.656 --> 38:35.132
Yeah, I'm sure. This is the healthiest
kid I've seen in a long time.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.982
- Really?
- Really.

38:38.165 --> 38:39.512
Really.

38:40.475 --> 38:41.723
Okay.

38:41.877 --> 38:44.590
Well, you know, the baby-sitter
was in the neighborhood, and

38:44.618 --> 38:47.382
she was worried so I,
I thought I'd get a second opinion.

38:47.515 --> 38:48.920
I see.

38:51.226 --> 38:52.761
Thank you.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.910
There's Daddy.

38:59.135 --> 39:00.651
- Say hi.
- Hey.

39:02.235 --> 39:03.482
What's he doing here?

39:03.518 --> 39:07.633
Um... I don't know. It's a warm night.
I thought we could all take a walk to the pier.

39:07.677 --> 39:10.380
Nice.
Let me go grab my coat.

39:10.947 --> 39:13.950
I guess, uh... his urine tested negative?

39:14.315 --> 39:16.960
Pratt doesn't think he needs a CBC?

39:17.808 --> 39:19.380
No.

39:20.307 --> 39:24.133
- I know, you think I'm acting crazy.
- No, I think you're acting like a mother--

39:24.146 --> 39:26.230
a slightly crazy one.

39:27.398 --> 39:30.181
- Did you dispo the Alzheimer's dad?
- Yeah.

39:31.065 --> 39:32.682
Poor guy.

39:33.966 --> 39:37.052
- It's so sad.
- Ah... he's lucky.

39:37.278 --> 39:38.301
What?

39:38.338 --> 39:41.653
He doesn't have to remember
losing a son every day.

39:54.675 --> 39:56.423
How're you gonna keep a job
if every single little problem

39:56.435 --> 39:58.970
- sends you right back to the bar?
- I don't need that kinda job.

39:59.008 --> 40:01.330
- Well, you need something.
- I am a damn firefighter.

40:01.378 --> 40:04.780
I rush into burning buildings, I axe
my way through roofs that are collapsing.

40:04.806 --> 40:06.192
I save people's lives,

40:06.218 --> 40:09.101
and now some snotty rich kid is trying
to tell me how to make his coffee,

40:09.135 --> 40:11.670
how to answer his phone,
send me back to the copy room

40:11.718 --> 40:15.831
because I made a little smudge
on his page. It's not right.

40:18.606 --> 40:21.652
For 35 years, every time
I thought it was gonna be different

40:21.875 --> 40:24.441
I could always count on you to screw up.

40:24.716 --> 40:27.773
- I had a bad day.
- It's always something.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.380
What are you going to do?

40:29.848 --> 40:32.952
- I don't know.
- Ah. You don't know. Well...

40:34.287 --> 40:37.892
You, uh... you can't live here.

40:42.505 --> 40:45.291
I'm family.
I'm your father.

40:48.035 --> 40:49.963
Is that what you think?

40:51.607 --> 40:55.091
Oh, screw you, you little bastard.
Screw you!

40:55.387 --> 40:58.082
I worked my ass off for you
and for your mother.

40:58.175 --> 41:02.243
I admit, I-I may not be the best at
home stuff, but I supported my family.

41:02.477 --> 41:06.322
I paid for your braces, for your books
and for your mother's fancy clothes

41:06.345 --> 41:09.571
and I never got a moment's
thanks from either one of you.

41:09.705 --> 41:14.582
Well, you may not like me, but you owe
me, you ungrateful little prick.

41:30.625 --> 41:32.012
Sarah.

41:33.576 --> 41:35.361
- Sarah.
- What?!

41:35.578 --> 41:37.091
Take those off.

41:38.508 --> 41:43.662
So we didn't get a chance to finish.
Do you want to, uh, do you want to talk?

41:48.318 --> 41:49.552
Here.

41:50.068 --> 41:53.412
- When did this come?
- Two weeks ago.

41:59.465 --> 42:02.840
I was kinda hoping that you were my dad.

42:07.057 --> 42:10.331
But maybe there's still a way I can live with you.

42:15.646 --> 42:17.090
We'll see.

42:19.545 --> 42:21.700
We'll see what we can do.

42:28.746 --> 42:33.772
