01:51.750 --> 01:53.500
OH, SHIT.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.417
I'M PREGNANT.

KILLS TWO COLLEGE GIRLS

02:04.542 --> 02:06.709
AND ESCAPES ON A STATE POLICE
SCREW-UP.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.375
LOOKING TO HOLD

02:08.375 --> 02:10.041
[scoffs]
I NEED A HIT.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.458
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

02:11.458 --> 02:12.709
FUCK OFF, TEEGAN.

02:12.709 --> 02:14.250

02:25.667 --> 02:26.792
WHO ARE YOU?

02:26.792 --> 02:28.458
I GOT IT, DEX.
GOT WHAT?

02:28.458 --> 02:30.375
ONLY THE CASE THAT'S GONNA
GET ME MY SHIELD.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.291
IT'S HUGE.
ANGEL PUT ME ON IT.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.333
WHO HE IS

02:33.333 --> 02:34.750
IS WHAT MAKES
THIS CASE HUGE.

02:34.750 --> 02:35.959
IT'S MIGUEL PRADO,

02:35.959 --> 02:37.792
ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.166
HE AND LAGUERTA
GO WAY BACK.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.208
THE OTHER GUY'S
RAMON PRADO,

02:41.208 --> 02:43.125
MIGUEL'S MIDDLE BROTHER.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.583
HE'S A LIEUTENANT WITH
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

02:44.583 --> 02:45.792
AND...

02:45.792 --> 02:46.875
OSCAR.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.041
PRADO?

02:48.041 --> 02:49.625
AS IN BABY BROTHER.

02:49.625 --> 02:52.250
(Dexter)
I'VE NEVER KILLED ANYONE
I DIDN'T COMPLETELY VET BEFORE,

02:52.250 --> 02:54.417
WHOSE GUILT I WASN'T
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF.

02:54.417 --> 02:56.291
OSCAR PRADO TRIED
TO KILL FREEBO.

02:56.291 --> 02:57.500
THEN HE TRIED TO KILL ME.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.125
HE'S GOTTA BE
GUILTY OF SOMETHING.

02:59.125 --> 03:02.000
WHY WOULD
A BLOOD SPATTER ANALYST

03:02.000 --> 03:03.875
SPEND TIME SEARCHING
FOR INFORMATION

03:03.875 --> 03:05.709
ON MY DEAD BROTHER?

03:05.709 --> 03:08.792
THIS ONE, THIS DEATH
GOT TO ME.

03:08.792 --> 03:10.125
MORGAN, RIGHT?
DO I KNOW YOU?

03:10.125 --> 03:11.875
YUKI AMADO,
INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

03:11.875 --> 03:12.792
AND?

03:12.792 --> 03:14.291
YOU KNOW JOEY QUINN?

03:14.291 --> 03:15.333
I'M GONNA DO YOU A FAVOR.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.375
CALL THIS GUY,

03:16.375 --> 03:18.291
TELL HIM YOU WANNA
CASH IN ONE OF MY COUPONS.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.917
HE'S AN INFORMANT
FROM MY DAYS IN NARCOTICS.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.625
YOU'RE ANTON?

03:22.625 --> 03:23.792
YOU GOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SHOW ME?

03:23.792 --> 03:25.083
WHAT ABOUT
THIS PRADO GUY?

03:25.083 --> 03:26.792
OH, YEAH,
I'VE SEEN HIM BEFORE.

03:26.792 --> 03:30.333
OSCAR PRADO WAS INTO FREEBO
FOR SOME SERIOUS CASH.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.083
YOU GETTING ALONG
WITH THE NEW BOSS MAN?

03:32.083 --> 03:33.125
AH, FUCK HIM.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.417
HE TOOK ME OFF
THE OSCAR PRADO CASE

03:34.417 --> 03:35.542
AND PUT ME ON THIS.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.000
SOME DEAD-END JANE DOE.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.291
(Dexter)
TEEGAN.
FREEBO'S GIRLFRIEND.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.333
LOOKS LIKE HE'S STILL
IN MIAMI.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.166
(Dexter)
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE HOPE
IN CHILDREN.

03:55.166 --> 03:59.542
BUT RIGHT NOW, ALL I SEE ARE
LITTLE BUNDLES OF UNCERTAINTY.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.166
AND GERMS.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.375
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER MATR.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.291
I LOVE KIDS.

04:04.291 --> 04:06.458
I CAN PLAY WITH THEM,
ENJOY THEM...

04:06.458 --> 04:08.166
AND LEAVE.

04:08.166 --> 04:12.583
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT WHAT THEY'LL BECOME.

04:15.166 --> 04:17.291
A NOBEL PRIZE LAUREATE.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.125
A DRUNK.

04:20.125 --> 04:24.083
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

04:24.083 --> 04:27.083
OR SOMEONE LIKE ME.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.542
WHY DO PARENTS
TAKE THE CHANCE?

04:29.542 --> 04:31.875
I'VE NEVER FELT COMPELLED.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.125
BUT WHY WOULD I?

04:33.125 --> 04:35.750
I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS
OF GIVING LIFE.

04:35.750 --> 04:39.583
[child crying]

04:44.625 --> 04:45.834
IT'S FOR SURE.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.208
I'M PREGNANT, HEH.

04:55.291 --> 04:56.917
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

04:59.583 --> 05:00.917
I DON'T KNOW.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.500
[ding]

05:13.250 --> 05:15.041
WE SHOULD TALK.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.917
WEIGH ALL THE OPTIONS.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.917
TOGETHER.

05:21.208 --> 05:23.083
I HAVE TO GET TO WORK.

05:24.917 --> 05:27.917
WEIGHING OPTIONS.
THE PROS AND CONS.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.917
SOMETHING I'M GOOD AT,
USUALLY.

05:35.792 --> 05:36.917
WHAT THE FUCK, DEX?

05:36.917 --> 05:39.125
I WAS YELLING AT YOU
TO HOLD THE ELEVATOR, ASS-WIPE.

05:39.125 --> 05:42.000
SORRY, I'M FEELING OFF.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.792
SO SEE A DOCTOR.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.291
SAW ONE.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.000
REALLY DIDN'T HELP.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.542
THE OSCAR PRADO CASE?

05:50.542 --> 05:52.792
YEAH, FUCKERS ARE ON
THE CAREER-MAKER OF THE YEAR.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.625
THEY NAIL THIS FREEBO GUY
AND THEY'RE GOLDEN.

05:54.625 --> 05:57.333
THE COURTS ALREADY
LET FREEBO GO ONCE

05:57.333 --> 05:59.125
FOR THOSE TWO GIRLS
IN THE EVERGLADES.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.500
THAT WAS THEN.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.375
THIS TIME, HE KILLED
A SENIOR A.D.A.'S BROTHER.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.500
AFTERNOON FIX.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.875
(Dexter)
EXCEPT HE DIDN'T KILL OSCAR.

06:07.875 --> 06:09.375
I DID.

06:09.375 --> 06:10.834
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR FREEBO,

06:10.834 --> 06:12.041
OSCAR WOULD STILL BE ALIVE,

06:12.041 --> 06:13.375
AND I WOULDN'T
BE IN THIS MESS.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.000
BESIDES, HE'S SEEN MY FACE.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.667
I'VE GOTTA FIND FREEBO
BEFORE THEY DO.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.375
THAT'S ONE THING
I'M SURE OF, AT LEAST.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.333
NICE WATCH.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.291
KNOCKOFF?

06:24.291 --> 06:26.250
ME? NO.
REAL THING ONLY.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.625
I SOLD A KIDNEY
TO GET IT.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.125
I'LL SHOW YOU THE SCAR
SOMETIME.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.458
I'LL GIVE YOU A KIDNEY
NOT TO.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.291
HEY, DEX,
DO ME A FAVOR.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.291
GO OVER THE PRADO
BLOOD EVIDENCE

06:35.291 --> 06:37.083
ONE MORE TIME, OKAY?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.166
MAYBE YOU MISSED SOMETHING.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.291
OKAY, BUT--
SERGEANT!

06:39.291 --> 06:40.792
YEAH?
WE GOT NARCOTICS
ON THE LINE.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.041
ALL RIGHT.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.166
HEY, DEX, WAIT UP.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.250
OH.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.667
MY JANE DOE.

06:51.667 --> 06:52.625
SEE WHAT YOU SEE.

06:52.625 --> 06:55.166
ALREADY SAW WHAT I SAW,
WHICH WAS NOTHING.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.875
SO SEE WHAT YOU SEE AGAIN.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.375
I CAN'T AFFORD
NONE SOLVED,

06:59.375 --> 07:00.542
AND I'VE GOT FUCK-ALL
ON THIS.

07:00.542 --> 07:03.166
CORONER SAYS HE FOUND
A PHARMACY IN HER.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.417
BIG SURPRISE, RIGHT?

07:04.417 --> 07:05.417
BODY DUMPED NEAR
THE WATERFRONT STROLL.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.709
SHOCKER.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.375
LOOKS LIKE EVERY OTHER
TWEAKER HOOKER CASE.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.333
EXCEPT THE TATTOO
PEELED OFF HER SHOULDER.

07:10.333 --> 07:13.375
CORONER SAYS
NOT A TATTOO.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.041
YOU'RE GETTING INTERESTED.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.291
[sighs]

07:18.291 --> 07:19.291
ACTUALLY,
I'M GETTING SLEEPY.

07:29.625 --> 07:33.583
IT'S REASSURING TO KNOW
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE AT SEA.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.417
I COULD THROW THEM A LINE,

07:35.417 --> 07:37.583
TELL THEM THEIR CASES
ARE LINKED.

07:37.583 --> 07:42.458
THAT JANE DOE IS ACTUALLY
FREEBO'S GIRLFRIEND.

07:42.458 --> 07:46.083
THAT IT WAS FREEBO
WHO KILLED HER.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.625
BUT I NEED THE HEAD START.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.917
STEP AWAY
FROM THE INCENSE.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.667
THIS IS AMERICA, BUDDY.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.917
FREEDOM OF RELIGION.

08:01.917 --> 08:04.667
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
A BUDDHIST, VINCE.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.291
JAPANESE
ARE TRADITIONALLY SHINTO.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.333
REALLY?
OH, WHATEVER.

08:09.333 --> 08:12.083
I BOUGHT ALL THIS SHIT
OFF MY MANICURIST.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.375
NEED ALL THE LUCK
I CAN GET.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.792
GOT A CRUCIFIX
UP THERE TOO.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.542
'CAUSE IT DID SO MUCH
FOR JESUS?

08:18.542 --> 08:19.959
'CAUSE FORENSICS QUARTERLY

08:19.959 --> 08:22.458
IS DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT
TO PUBLISH MY ARTICLE.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.750
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE YOU READ.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.125
AND PROOFED.

08:26.125 --> 08:28.041
THE INCENSE STAYS.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.333
DID HE USE YOU
AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE?

08:39.917 --> 08:41.542
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO USE ME, MARIA.

08:41.542 --> 08:44.333
A.D.A.s CAN PUT PRESSURE
ON OTHER AGENCIES.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.583
WE HAVE RAMON, WHO'S
WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

08:45.583 --> 08:46.542
TOGETHER, WE--

08:46.542 --> 08:48.208
MIGUEL, MIGUEL, TRANQUILLO.

08:48.208 --> 08:51.792
I KNOW THAT YOU AND RAMON
ARE GOING TO HELP.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.583
AND IT'S HARD TO LET
SOMEBODY ELSE

08:53.583 --> 08:55.041
HANDLE OSCAR'S CASE.

08:55.041 --> 08:57.375
BUT I HAVE MY BEST
DETECTIVES ON THIS.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.250
I GOT THE BEST
FORENSICS TEAM--

08:59.250 --> 09:01.125
MORGAN, RIGHT?
HE'S PART OF IT.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.542
WE ARE TRACKING DOWN

09:02.542 --> 09:04.875
EVERY ONE OF FREEBO'S
KNOWN ASSOCIATES--

09:04.875 --> 09:06.041
LOOKING UNDER EVERY ROCK.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.417
WE WILL FIND HIM.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.166
THIS IS A GOOD TEAM.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.583
THIS IS THE SAME TEAM,
BY THE WAY,

09:10.583 --> 09:12.875
THAT SHARED A ROOF
WITH THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

09:14.792 --> 09:16.291
THAT WAS TOTALLY
OUT OF LINE.

09:16.291 --> 09:19.500
I'M--I'M SORRY, MARIA.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.208
IT'S JUST THAT MY--
MY FUSE IS SO SHORT

09:26.208 --> 09:28.166
EVER SINCE OSCAR.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.041
EVEN WITH SYL.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.000
I'M DRIVING HER NUTS.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.667
I DOUBT THAT.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.667
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S GOT.

09:49.208 --> 09:51.208
THE BAY HARBOR
BUTCHER SITUATION--

09:51.208 --> 09:53.375
NO, DON'T--
NO, PLEASE.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.208
I WAS TOO PERSONALLY
INVOLVED

10:00.208 --> 10:03.333
TO SEE IT CLEARLY.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.709
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE DISTANCED
MYSELF FROM THINGS.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.709
YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME
WITH OSCAR.

10:17.458 --> 10:18.750
I KNOW.

10:22.041 --> 10:24.375
I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:24.375 --> 10:28.750
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.709
WE'RE NOT AS CLOSE
AS WE USED TO BE.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.834
BUT AT LEAST I STILL
HAVE YOU AS A COLLEAGUE.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.250
AND I'M GLAD THAT IT'S YOU
THAT'S HERE.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.917
MM-HMM.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.792
GRACIAS.

10:58.417 --> 11:00.500
(Dexter)
MIGUEL PRADO'S ALREADY
SEEN TOO MUCH OF ME.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.083
I CAN'T COMFORT
THE GRIEVING.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.250
YOU GOT THIS?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.333
I GOT THIS.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.500
DON'T LOOK FAMILIAR, HON.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.750
OOH, BUT THOSE ARE
SOME FINE STREAKS.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.500
WHO DID HER HAIR?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.875
CHRISTOPHE
OF BEVERLY FUCKIN' HILLS.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.542
YEAH, DO YOU HAVE
HIS NUMBER?

11:30.542 --> 11:31.625
PETUNIA,

11:31.625 --> 11:33.792
YOU ARE THE DUMBEST WHORE
ON THIS STROLL.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.375
SORRY, SUGAR.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.792
DON'T GOT A NAME
FOR YOU.

11:36.792 --> 11:38.458
KEEP WALKIN',
GIRL.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.667
IT'S ALL
YOU'RE GOOD FOR.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.417
S'UP, DEB?

11:43.417 --> 11:46.083
THE SHE-MALES
GIVE YOU ANY LEADS?

11:46.083 --> 11:47.959
IT'S OFFICER MORGAN
TO YOU.

11:47.959 --> 11:50.083
RIGHT, NOT A DETECTIVE YET.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.792
COURSE, AN UNSOLVED
ISN'T GONNA GET YOU ANY CLOSER

11:52.792 --> 11:54.208
TO A SHIELD.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.542
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY
I.A. PICKED ME, BUT--

11:55.542 --> 11:57.709
'CAUSE DETECTIVE QUINN
LIKES THE LADIES.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.500
WELL, THEN YOU DON'T
NEED A SNITCH.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.875
YOU NEED A FUCKIN' SLUT.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.917
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK
TO PETUNIA OVER THERE?

12:03.917 --> 12:05.709
I CAN GET YOU A SHIELD
TOMORROW.

46:12.375 --> 46:13.542
IS HE IN THERE?

46:19.208 --> 46:20.792
ALIVE?

46:33.542 --> 46:35.667
[exhales]

46:38.208 --> 46:39.750
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

46:46.917 --> 46:49.291
I FOUND A FORENSICS LEAD.

46:51.333 --> 46:52.583
IT WAS A LONG SHOT.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.750
I WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT
BEFORE...

46:53.750 --> 46:56.750
I WASTED ANYONE'S TIME.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.875
I DIDN'T EXPECT
FREEBO TO BE HERE.

46:59.875 --> 47:01.709
HE SURPRISED ME.

47:01.709 --> 47:02.750
HE JUMPED ME...

47:02.750 --> 47:04.792
WITH THIS KNIFE.

47:04.792 --> 47:06.250
THAT LOOKS LIKE
MY FATHER'S KNIFE FROM--

47:06.250 --> 47:07.375
FROM VIETNAM.

47:07.375 --> 47:09.000
HE GAVE THAT TO OSCAR.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.834
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I FOUGHT BACK.

47:25.959 --> 47:29.000
THE KNIFE ENDED UP
IN HIS NECK.

47:36.125 --> 47:37.542
I--

47:37.542 --> 47:38.792
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

47:38.792 --> 47:43.291
I WASN'T SURE
THAT I COULD DO THIS.

47:43.291 --> 47:44.959
BUT YOU DID.

47:44.959 --> 47:47.291
YOU DID.

47:50.458 --> 47:52.250
WE'RE GONNA GET RID
OF THE EVIDENCE.

47:52.250 --> 47:53.458
NO. NO!

47:53.458 --> 47:54.750
YOU SHOULD LEAVE--NOW.
NO!

47:54.750 --> 47:56.959
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.

48:04.875 --> 48:07.166
THANK YOU.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.667
YOU'RE WELCOME.

48:15.250 --> 48:20.333
