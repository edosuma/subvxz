00:00.860 --> 00:03.761
- Previously on Being Human...

00:03.800 --> 00:05.928
- Hey, it's me.
I need your help.

00:05.970 --> 00:07.768
- You're a vampire?

00:07.800 --> 00:09.939
- You had no right
to turn her!

00:09.970 --> 00:12.109
- We wanted to see
what was so special.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.608
- I feel like a goddess.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.245
- Once the high wears off, it is more
gruesome than you could realize.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.078
- Ahh!

00:18.110 --> 00:20.272
- I'm lonely.
- Me too.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.948
- You can move
with your thoughts.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.516
- Shut up!
- Where are we?

00:25.550 --> 00:26.620
- Danny's old place.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.754
- Danny?
- My fiance.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.758
Danny...

00:30.790 --> 00:32.952
Bridget?

00:37.670 --> 00:39.593
(Insects buzzing, chirping)

00:41.100 --> 00:44.661
- (Aidan): Quick. What's the world's
most rapidly evaporating resource?

00:44.710 --> 00:46.269
- Ahh!
- Oil?

00:46.310 --> 00:48.438
- What is that? Something in the bushes.
- Water.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.244
Fresh air?

00:52.980 --> 00:54.778
Not even close.

00:56.420 --> 00:57.945
** It's gone *

00:57.990 --> 01:00.960
* But I don't even know *

01:02.890 --> 01:05.120
* Like a steam drill... *

01:05.160 --> 01:07.527
When's the last time
you were truly alone?

01:07.560 --> 01:09.699
- Remember the guy
who took your picture?

01:09.730 --> 01:10.822
- Yeah.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.237
- When you didn't
think to yourself...

01:13.270 --> 01:14.863
- Classic.
- Yeah.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.459
- Classic shot.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.831
- "Somebody's watching me?"

01:18.870 --> 01:19.940
(Screaming)

01:19.980 --> 01:22.005
A man can wander for
an eternity these days

01:22.040 --> 01:26.443
before finding a place where
he can be himself, let go...

01:26.480 --> 01:28.710
- We don't want any trouble.
- Sorry.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.411
- ...howl at the moon.

01:30.450 --> 01:33.488
How did we let this
happen to us?

01:33.520 --> 01:37.457
* Was living for the heart... *

01:39.160 --> 01:40.321
- Um... see ya.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.795
- Yeah, good night.
Thank you.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.235
* Ain't love just like
fumbling in the dark? *

01:47.270 --> 01:48.738
(Chuckling)

01:51.540 --> 01:53.702
* She's gone 7 *

01:53.740 --> 01:56.539
* 7 or 8 days *

01:56.580 --> 01:58.844
* She's gone where
I don't even know *

01:58.880 --> 02:00.712
- Why do we insist on looking

02:00.750 --> 02:02.980
when our every impulse
tells us...

02:03.020 --> 02:05.216
* She's gone 7... *

02:05.250 --> 02:06.649
"Look away?"

02:06.690 --> 02:08.886
- Ahh!

02:08.919 --> 02:12.891
* She's gone where
I don't even know *

02:14.460 --> 02:17.862
- Maybe it's because we all
have something to hide.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.562
* Dust the cage... *

02:23.770 --> 02:27.274
That thing
we bury down deep...

02:30.110 --> 02:32.977
* Dog's under the porch light *

02:33.020 --> 02:35.739
* Sleeping with
his one eye open *

02:35.780 --> 02:37.179
* Open for... **

02:37.220 --> 02:40.952
beat back into the darkness
with everything we have.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.219
(Exhales)

02:46.930 --> 02:48.955
We're secretly hoping to see

02:49.000 --> 02:52.766
that the monster inside
each of us is inside us all.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.199
(Screaming)

02:54.240 --> 02:56.095
There it is.

02:56.140 --> 02:58.837
Look hard enough,
you'll see it.

02:58.870 --> 03:01.134
You will be seen.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.739
(Roaring)

03:06.920 --> 03:08.319
(Grunting)

03:08.350 --> 03:10.079
(Birds chirping)

03:11.390 --> 03:12.880
(Exhaling)

03:12.920 --> 03:14.410
- Ah!

03:15.820 --> 03:17.458
- It's OK.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.425
It's just some clothes.
Go ahead.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.269
- It was over
a mile north of here.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.495
- Who are you?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.191
- Seriously, chief,
just get dressed.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.993
You're not the only one
who's uncomfortable.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.837
You know, you suck
at being a werewolf.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.646
It's almost offensive.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.914
- What are you talking about?

03:41.950 --> 03:43.247
- I told you.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.746
It's OK.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.351
Name's Ray.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.922
I'm a werewolf, too.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.475
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.

04:07.510 --> 04:08.807
You took my clothes.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.672
Least you could do
is talk to me!

04:10.710 --> 04:12.678
- Sorry, I don't talk to
delusional people.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.142
- You know
I'm telling the truth.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.547
It's only been a coupe of hours
since your last change.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.046
Your senses
are still blazing.

04:18.089 --> 04:20.478
You could smell
what I am.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.182
Oh, for crying out loud, Josh!

04:33.440 --> 04:35.260
- How do you know my name?

04:35.300 --> 04:38.565
- I been at this
a while, you know?

04:39.840 --> 04:40.978
I can help you.

04:43.780 --> 04:44.941
- How?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.278
Once a month,
I'm an animal,

04:47.320 --> 04:48.879
a killer.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.788
I have to run away from
my home, my friends, everyone.

04:52.820 --> 04:56.188
I have to protect
the world from myself!

04:56.220 --> 04:57.756
- And I can help you
with that.

04:57.790 --> 05:01.954
We could look out for each
other. We keep everyone safe.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.161
What do you say?

05:04.730 --> 05:06.494
- Thanks for the clothes.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.199
- Oh, come on! Josh!

05:21.080 --> 05:23.219
- We're late.
Shower up.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.755
Why are you dressed
like a douche?

05:33.100 --> 05:36.024
- Because a douche
gave me these clothes.

05:36.060 --> 05:39.769
No, sorry, a werewolf douche
gave me these clothes.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.939
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm dead serious.

05:41.970 --> 05:44.803
Yeah, Ray the werewolf.
He's been watching me.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.035
- No.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.572
- Yes!

05:47.610 --> 05:50.307
(Microwave beeping)

05:50.350 --> 05:53.012
Just when I start to think
that there's hope,

05:53.050 --> 05:55.917
like, real hope for me to be
just like everybody else,

05:55.950 --> 05:58.317
I wake up
and I'm in hell!

05:58.350 --> 06:01.251
- I'm in hell! 1 died
and now I'm actually in hell!

06:01.290 --> 06:02.451
- What happened to you?

06:02.490 --> 06:03.628
- We were just talking
about how I'm in hell,

06:03.660 --> 06:06.288
but whatever,
let's talk about you.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.923
- I just spent my night
watching Danny and Bridget

06:07.960 --> 06:09.519
simper and swoon
over each other.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.993
If I had bodily fluids,
I'd spew them.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.691
- Who is Bridget?

06:13.740 --> 06:15.390
- My best friend
since 3rd grade

06:15.440 --> 06:17.602
- who I now realize
is also a brutal whore.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.632
- You can come and go
as you please now.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.944
- Yeah. Why didn't you just leave?
- That's just it.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.006
I didn't have control. Apparently,
I go wherever my mind goes.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.439
I didn't wanna watch
Danny and Bridget, so I left.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.040
But then I couldn't stop
thinking about them together.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.239
Next thing I know, wham!

06:32.290 --> 06:33.655
- You're watching them.

06:33.690 --> 06:35.556
- It's a vicious cycle!

06:36.890 --> 06:37.857
(Sighs)

06:37.890 --> 06:39.892
Why are you dressed
like a douche?

06:39.930 --> 06:41.819
- Josh met another werewolf.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.898
- Aw!
- Who's stalking him.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.329
- Ew.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.260
- I'm gonna shower.

06:51.270 --> 06:52.578
- What do I do?

06:54.840 --> 06:57.047
- Well, T'll tell you
what you do.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.947
You be strong
and you focus on other things.

06:59.980 --> 07:04.190
- Maybe I'll have your willpower
after being around for a century or two.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.860
(Siren wailing)

07:16.900 --> 07:20.291
- (Man on PA):
Blood drop 3427.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.230
Blood, 3427.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.704
- Hold up!
What are you doing?

07:24.740 --> 07:26.606
- I'm transferring Mr. Shaw.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.075
- Really? Where?
There aren't any beds here.

07:29.110 --> 07:32.671
- You sure? I was sent by
Dr. Prindaar. Maybe you could check.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.676
- Robyn?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.246
Can you get this gentleman's
paperwork started?

07:36.280 --> 07:38.783
We'll get you
all squared away, Mr. Shaw.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.585
You think I don't know how many
beds I have available?

07:41.620 --> 07:44.749
- No, no, it's just that
Dr. Prindaar said--

07:44.790 --> 07:48.420
- Dr. Prindaar is what's clinically
known as a jackass and a coward.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.098
I already informed
Dr. Prindaar

07:50.130 --> 07:52.121
that I don't have
any space for Mr. Shaw.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.899
That's why he had
a dopey, doe-eyed,

07:53.940 --> 07:56.363
sad-looking orderly
bring him down here.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.004
He thought I'd have mercy
"cause you're doe--

07:58.040 --> 08:00.338
- And sad-looking.
I get it.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.275
- Go.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.549
(Clearing throat)

08:07.580 --> 08:09.218
- I don't know, man,

08:09.250 --> 08:11.947
but it's one of
the drawbacks of...

08:11.990 --> 08:13.719
Hey, there he is!

08:13.760 --> 08:17.185
- What are you doing here?
- You ready to talk, chief?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.324
- It's Ray.
- Yeah, thanks. You have to leave.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.397
- All I'm asking for
is one cup of coffee.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.762
- Know what?
- Can we have a minute?

08:25.170 --> 08:27.662
- He knows where I work?
That we're roommates?

08:27.700 --> 08:29.190
- Can I just say something?

08:29.240 --> 08:31.436
- You want me to hang out
with this lunatic? Seriously?

08:31.470 --> 08:33.198
- Josh, you are a rare breed,

08:33.240 --> 08:34.400
but don't you think
it might be good

08:34.440 --> 08:37.000
to spend a little time
with someone like you?

08:38.679 --> 08:40.409
- No. Not really.

08:40.450 --> 08:41.940
The one thing
I've been able to do

08:41.980 --> 08:43.345
with this thing
I carry around with me

08:43.390 --> 08:44.448
is keep it small.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.811
OK? I deserve to contain
my own private hell.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.715
And now this guy pops up,

08:48.760 --> 08:50.751
and suddenly
there's two of us.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.225
If I let him in, Aidan,

08:53.260 --> 08:56.195
it all gets bigger.

08:56.230 --> 08:57.527
- You may only change
once a month,

08:57.570 --> 09:01.461
but your anxiety about who you
are, what you are, it consumes you.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.502
It is not small.

09:09.210 --> 09:12.578
- (Man on PA):
Dr. Smith, please call 7428.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.387
- One cup of coffee.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.812
Tomorrow.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.214
- Sweet!

09:21.260 --> 09:22.921
That's awesome, bro!

09:25.490 --> 09:27.197
- We're not bros.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.000
- You rough with
all the girls,

09:40.040 --> 09:41.474
or is it just
a thing with me?

09:41.510 --> 09:43.569
- What do you want, Rebecca?
- Just to talk.

09:43.610 --> 09:47.410
I know you hate me, but you're
the only one who understands.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.520
- What?

09:48.550 --> 09:50.348
- Just try to remember
for a second

09:50.390 --> 09:51.880
that you give
a damn about me.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.059
I need you to get me out.

09:54.090 --> 09:55.319
Or just...

09:56.320 --> 09:59.153
God, just end this now!

10:03.200 --> 10:05.498
- You wanna get away from
Bishop just like that.

10:05.530 --> 10:06.998
- Bishop is just the tip

10:07.040 --> 10:10.032
of the whole nasty pile
of blood-lusting garbage.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.834
- 'Cause the last I remember,

10:11.870 --> 10:14.100
you were having
the time of your life

10:14.140 --> 10:16.029
tearing through
innocent people.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.248
- I thought
it made me strong,

10:19.280 --> 10:20.975
invincible.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.342
I'm the weakest
thing on earth.

10:25.390 --> 10:29.759
But the rush, the fantasy of how
I'd kill, when I'd Kkill, it's gone.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.656
It's like I snapped out
of twilight sleep,

10:31.690 --> 10:33.692
and now I can hear
people whimper,

10:33.730 --> 10:35.391
see the fear
in their eyes.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.199
I hate what I am...

10:39.230 --> 10:41.062
what I've become.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.229
I can't stop.
I can't fight it.

10:44.270 --> 10:48.605
Not by myself.
- It's... It's not your fault.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.074
You didn't choose.

10:50.110 --> 10:52.101
- No, I didn't.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.041
But everything I've done
since turning...

11:00.090 --> 11:04.482
I could stop. You stopped.
- It's not that easy.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.929
- But you could help me.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.156
- I don't know.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.623
- You wanted to help me.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.062
Doesn't "better late than never"”
count for anything anymore?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.309
- What time does
the game start?

11:29.350 --> 11:30.579
- 7:30.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.987
- We should be done
just in time.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.055
- Ugh, vomit!

11:34.090 --> 11:36.730
- Do you have a strainer?
- Yup.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.081
- (Both):
Bottom-right cabinet.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.326
- You know, we could've
ordered in some pizza.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.452
You didn't
have to cook.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.899
- I love cooking.

11:43.930 --> 11:45.523
- Ha! Please!

11:45.570 --> 11:47.789
- I never knew
you were a baseball fan.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.036
- That's because she's not.
- Oh yeah!

11:50.070 --> 11:52.038
- And you like to cook.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.606
- No, she really can't.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.734
- You should taste it
before you judge.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.249
- "Oh, Danny,
I love baseball and cooking

11:58.280 --> 11:59.975
"and being a slut and lying.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.442
"Will you please do me?"

12:01.480 --> 12:03.346
- Look, what is this?

12:04.950 --> 12:06.611
What are we doing here?

12:06.650 --> 12:08.379
- It's dinner and baseball.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.956
- Yeah, I don't care
about dinner

12:09.990 --> 12:11.879
and I don't care
about the Red Sox game.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.728
All I keep thinking about

12:13.760 --> 12:16.127
is what happened
the other night.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.720
- I was wondering if we were
gonna act like nothing happened.

12:18.770 --> 12:21.330
- Wanna know what's happening?
I'll tell you...

12:21.370 --> 12:23.907
- But then you came over
and it hit me: Why do that?

12:23.940 --> 12:26.659
- ...and you're about to make
a huge mistake!

12:26.710 --> 12:28.235
- Because of Sally.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.647
- Sally! Yes!
Thank you for caring!

12:30.680 --> 12:32.375
- What about us?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.412
I mean, we're still here.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.611
- And so am I!

12:35.650 --> 12:37.709
(Shattering)

12:37.750 --> 12:38.740
Holy crap!

12:38.790 --> 12:40.087
Did I just?

12:40.120 --> 12:42.054
- Let me...
- I did just do that!

12:42.090 --> 12:43.785
- I don't know
what happened.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.628
- I happened!
- That was weird.

12:45.660 --> 12:48.095
(* Soft rock *)

12:49.630 --> 12:53.464
<i>** I know it isn't right... *</i>

12:53.500 --> 12:55.468
- Stop!
- Wait.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.166
I can't do this.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.974
Don't you ever...

13:02.010 --> 13:05.605
I don't know. Don't you
ever feel like she's watching?

13:05.650 --> 13:08.176
- Well, I don't know
about that.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.349
* Who you gonna
run to now... **

13:11.390 --> 13:13.313
Maybe this is
a bad idea.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.824
- I think I should go.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.867
(Sally exhaling)

13:26.230 --> 13:29.268
- (Josh): "Hey, Josh,
how about a cup of coffee...

13:29.300 --> 13:32.031
"and a 10-mile hike
through the woods?"

13:32.070 --> 13:34.232
"Sounds great, Ray!"

13:34.280 --> 13:36.942
- Couldn't do this
in a coffee shop!

13:36.980 --> 13:38.709
We need to be out here.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.878
- For what?
- Your education.

13:40.920 --> 13:46.780
You're a dangerous man, to yourself and to others.
- Think I don't know that?

13:46.820 --> 13:51.428
- So we're gonna teach you
to transform safely.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.225
Rule number one:
No one gets hurt.

13:54.260 --> 13:55.523
All right?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.494
We don't wanna kill anyone

13:57.530 --> 13:59.498
or turn them.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.396
Am I right?

14:04.140 --> 14:06.108
- So, what's rule number 27?

14:06.140 --> 14:09.940
- Well, normally,
you steer clear of vampires,

14:09.980 --> 14:13.917
but you've already
crapped the bed on that one.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.114
What's the deal there, anyway?

14:17.150 --> 14:19.187
Anytime I've ever
been around vamps,

14:19.220 --> 14:21.552
they're breaking
their foot off in my ass.

14:21.590 --> 14:24.287
- No, Aidan's not like that.
He's one of the good ones.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.128
- Oh sure, he must
be part of that

14:26.160 --> 14:30.063
soft-and-cuddly sect of vampires
I've been hearing about.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.626
- Hey, how'd you
find me, anyway?

14:32.670 --> 14:35.230
- Same way I find any of us:

14:36.100 --> 14:38.330
papers, websites.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.099
I look for patterns.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.508
Gloucester has some
strange animal deaths.

14:43.550 --> 14:47.839
You tore up a lot of deer
in these woods, my friend.

14:50.450 --> 14:53.750
- Have you, um...
Are there others?

14:56.260 --> 14:57.853
- Not in these woods.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.929
This is it!

15:02.970 --> 15:04.460
- This is what?

15:05.300 --> 15:07.291
- School.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.205
- You change into
a werewolf in here?

15:11.240 --> 15:12.332
- Nah.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.532
Somebody stumbles
across this place,

15:14.580 --> 15:16.002
you'll both be screwed.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.575
Nah, this place,

15:18.610 --> 15:21.841
it's just somewhere to
keep your stuff dry and safe.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.848
Now...

15:23.890 --> 15:28.054
the key to an easy-and-simple
werewolf transformation

15:28.090 --> 15:29.683
is preparation.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.258
First thing to pack
is a change of clothes,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.927
naturally!

15:34.960 --> 15:38.624
Next up we have wet wipes
to clean yourself off.

15:38.670 --> 15:42.459
I prefer fresh scent.
You look like a citrus guy.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.661
(Chuckles)

15:43.710 --> 15:47.032
Disposable cell phone
for emergencies.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.105
- Right.
- Water.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.278
For before and after.

15:50.310 --> 15:53.075
I've found that the change
goes a little smoother

15:53.120 --> 15:54.212
if you're hydrated.

15:55.380 --> 15:59.010
PB-and-J, in case you don't eat
while you're changed.

15:59.050 --> 16:02.088
Has your stomach adjusted yet?

16:02.120 --> 16:03.986
- Adjusted to what?

16:04.030 --> 16:07.728
- A wolf's stomach processes
food different than a person's.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.229
First few times
after changing,

16:10.270 --> 16:13.991
I found myself throwing up
all the animals that I'd eaten.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.203
Wolf would chow down
on some crazy stuff.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.629
That ever happen to you?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.569
- I think the wolf
eats its own poo.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.818
- Yeah.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.043
Yeah, that's the worst.

16:35.860 --> 16:39.182
- Are you sure this isn't safer
than running around out there?

16:39.230 --> 16:41.824
I mean, no one's safe
with us roaming the forest.

16:41.860 --> 16:44.466
- That's where this guy
comes in!

16:44.500 --> 16:46.229
- What is that, a steak?

16:46.270 --> 16:48.796
- Rump roast, to be exact!

16:48.840 --> 16:53.573
Now, we have about a couple
of hours or so after sunset

16:53.610 --> 16:55.601
before we change, right?

16:55.640 --> 16:56.835
- Yeah.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.439
- So we use this time

16:58.480 --> 17:01.916
to take our little friend here
for a walk, right?

17:01.950 --> 17:05.250
Using this place
as a centre point,

17:05.290 --> 17:07.156
we walk around in a circle,

17:07.190 --> 17:10.079
about a mile or so
in diameter.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.383
That night, you change.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.228
Wolf will pick up the scent

17:14.260 --> 17:15.659
and spend his evening

17:15.700 --> 17:19.489
hunting down this
delicious bit of prime beef!

17:21.140 --> 17:24.201
- So, the wolf just
walks around in a circle.

17:24.240 --> 17:27.608
- No straying,
no running into Bambi.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.472
- Hal

17:29.510 --> 17:31.740
- What's rule number one?

17:34.580 --> 17:36.412
- No one gets hurt.

17:37.850 --> 17:38.817
(Laughing)

17:38.850 --> 17:40.079
- That's right!

17:42.590 --> 17:44.058
(Knocking on door)

17:45.830 --> 17:48.299
- Did you bring it?
God, I'm starving!

17:48.330 --> 17:50.719
- That's not as potent
as what you're used to.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.420
- Works for you,
doesn't it?

17:52.470 --> 17:54.939
- It's not the same rush
as the live stuff.

17:54.970 --> 17:56.665
It's methadone.
It's powdered milk.

17:56.700 --> 18:00.432
- It's blood!
- Also, it tastes not...

18:00.480 --> 18:03.006
It just takes some
getting used to.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.809
Rebecca, that was...

18:05.850 --> 18:07.318
- I can't do this.
- ...all I brought.

18:07.350 --> 18:10.115
- No, I gotta go.
I gotta...

18:10.150 --> 18:12.539
- Hey, hey, hey. Come here.
- No!

18:12.590 --> 18:14.479
- Listen, you're gonna be OK.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.579
You're gonna be all right.

18:20.330 --> 18:23.721
- I haven't eaten in days.
- OK, uh...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.022
I can get more.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.526
I just need to
go back to the house.

18:26.570 --> 18:27.560
- No...

18:30.470 --> 18:31.904
Stay.

18:35.910 --> 18:39.005
Please, Aidan.
- Don't do this.

18:39.050 --> 18:40.370
- Please, Aidan.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.716
Just...

18:48.160 --> 18:50.322
(Biting)

18:50.360 --> 18:51.555
(Moaning)

18:51.590 --> 18:53.456
(Breathing heavily)

18:53.500 --> 18:55.355
- Vampire blood...

18:55.400 --> 18:58.199
ain't much better
than hospital blood.

18:58.230 --> 18:59.891
- It's good.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.830
You taste good.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.158
(Exhaling)

19:34.870 --> 19:36.861
- Oh, that was good.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.459
- That...

19:39.210 --> 19:42.202
That can't happen again.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.100
- Why?

19:47.150 --> 19:48.845
It's not like
we killed anybody.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.542
- Rebecca, I wanna help you.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.651
I do. But...

19:55.220 --> 19:56.654
I've been here before.

19:56.690 --> 20:00.399
Blood leads to bloodlust.
Bloodlust leads to bloodshed.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.750
No.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.091
No, no, no, no.

20:04.130 --> 20:06.770
We have to
nip it in the bud.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.632
- So that's it?

20:08.670 --> 20:11.435
_ I have to live
like an anorexic nun??

20:20.380 --> 20:22.917
I think this might be
too much for me.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.245
- The longer
that you abstain,

20:26.290 --> 20:27.689
the more that
you will appreciate

20:27.720 --> 20:30.758
the reason why
you're doing it.

20:30.790 --> 20:34.351
- You're so full of it.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.267
You know it felt good
to bite into flesh,

20:37.300 --> 20:39.894
drink it till
you can't see straight.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.268
I needed to feed.

20:45.670 --> 20:48.105
But I think maybe
you needed this more.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.608
- Ah...

20:52.950 --> 20:54.475
- And I think...

20:54.520 --> 20:56.272
maybe...

20:56.320 --> 20:58.345
you might still be hungry.

21:02.590 --> 21:03.580
Mmm!

21:04.830 --> 21:06.150
(Aidan moaning)

21:06.190 --> 21:07.453
Oh!

21:08.800 --> 21:11.269
- And they're picking up
the glass I knocked over,

21:11.300 --> 21:12.529
and then he gives her

21:12.570 --> 21:14.299
the "I'm gonna make out
with you" look.

21:14.340 --> 21:17.731
- No, he didn't!
- Actually, he didn't, because I was all: "Ahh!"

21:17.770 --> 21:20.899
And then they heard it
or they felt it

21:20.940 --> 21:22.704
because then
they just stopped.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.607
- You pencil jammed him!
- From beyond the grave.

21:25.650 --> 21:27.778
It was the Death Star
of pencil jams.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.744
- Hey, there he is! Hey, man.
What's shaking?

21:30.790 --> 21:31.882
- Hey, Ray.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.685
You split Danny
and your friend up?

21:34.720 --> 21:35.687
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.257
And I broke a wine glass
with my brain.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.999
- Who's ready for crepes?
- Oh, hell yeah!

21:42.030 --> 21:44.089
- So, you guys
really hit it off.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.827
- Yeah, the man knows
his way around a rump roast.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.807
He knows his stuff.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.832
You all right?
You look a little off.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.076
- Uh...
- I know that look.

21:57.110 --> 21:59.841
Someone got some stink
last night.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.577
- (Laughing):
Oh, I see it!

22:02.620 --> 22:04.440
- (Josh): Did you?

22:05.420 --> 22:06.888
Did you?

22:07.890 --> 22:09.756
(Laughing)

22:09.790 --> 22:12.157
Did you get some stink?

22:12.190 --> 22:14.830
Yeah, I'm not pulling that off.
You want a crepe?

22:14.860 --> 22:15.827
- No.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.589
- Hey, you were
right, actually.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.600
Ray's a pretty decent guy.
He doesn't have a place to stay.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.268
I was thinking maybe he could
crash here for a while.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.803
- Really? Because
we hardly know him.

22:28.010 --> 22:32.743
- Well, you're the one who
told me to give him a chance.

22:32.780 --> 22:35.340
So, what...

22:35.380 --> 22:38.884
you worried about having more
than one werewolf in the house?

22:38.920 --> 22:40.388
- Of course not!

22:40.420 --> 22:42.081
- Good.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.658
- Hold on. Can you talk
this over with Sally?

22:45.690 --> 22:47.158
- (Ray):
Think of those two...

22:47.190 --> 22:48.089
- (Josh):
My god! Seriously?

22:48.130 --> 22:50.770
- ...getting all up
on each other.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.268
(Sally panting)

22:52.300 --> 22:53.768
If not for you,

22:53.800 --> 22:57.759
there definitely would have
been digital manipulation.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.302
(Grunts)
- Yeah!

23:01.310 --> 23:03.404
- She's cool with it.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.101
(Sally giggling)

23:06.150 --> 23:09.120
** I feel like
selling my things *

23:11.850 --> 23:15.684
<i>* I feel like being alone *</i>

23:17.190 --> 23:20.820
* Can't tell if
I'm all confused *

23:22.830 --> 23:26.425
* After I hung up the phone *

23:28.440 --> 23:32.559
* Glad to hear
you're feeling stronger *

23:34.280 --> 23:37.773
* And that you're
ready to grow *

23:39.610 --> 23:44.787
* Did you know that
I was in your way *

23:44.820 --> 23:49.018
* Thanks for saying it
Now I know *

23:50.530 --> 23:54.125
* Ooh ooh *

23:54.160 --> 23:55.958
* Ooh *

23:56.000 --> 24:01.268
* Ooh so this is how
these things go *

24:02.470 --> 24:07.362
* Ooh ooh ooh *

24:07.410 --> 24:10.300
* So this is how these things *

24:10.340 --> 24:13.241
* Check-out in the end... *

24:14.320 --> 24:16.778
- We need another round.

24:16.820 --> 24:19.710
I wanna make a toast to my
favourite time of the month.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.013
(Chuckling)

24:21.060 --> 24:22.949
The moon's almost ripe.

24:22.990 --> 24:27.325
Everything we are
is just under the skin.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.556
Strength is there.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.365
Senses are heightened.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.668
You smell that?

24:35.700 --> 24:38.635
- What?
- Women.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.407
You ever have sex
around this time?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.078
- (Man): Hey, Chuck.
How are you?

24:44.110 --> 24:45.077
- Nope.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.509
- It's crazy train. Yeah.

24:46.550 --> 24:47.517
(Woman laughing)

24:47.550 --> 24:49.439
- I haven't had
any relationships

24:49.480 --> 24:52.188
since this happened to me.

24:52.220 --> 24:54.814
Yeah, I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.282
Rule number one, right?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.960
- I'm not asking
about relationships.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.697
I'm asking about bangin'.

25:01.730 --> 25:07.225
Women love the wolf.
- You guys hungry? Wanna see some menus?

25:07.270 --> 25:08.396
- Um...

25:08.440 --> 25:11.569
- I'm hungry, but what I
want ain't on the menu.

25:11.610 --> 25:12.839
- Wow, that's original.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.237
- I'm sorry if
that was crass,

25:15.280 --> 25:18.102
but I'm just trying
to cut through all the bull.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.949
I'm telling the truth.

25:20.980 --> 25:24.518
I think you're
drop-dead beautiful.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.359
- Well, go on.

25:29.390 --> 25:34.749
- I want to buy you a drink,
maybe 2, and see what happens.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.964
But I'm willing to bet
that after a drink, maybe 2,

25:39.000 --> 25:40.866
we end up in bed.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.437
- Well, I don't drink.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.748
Here's my number.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.976
I get off at 1:00.

25:58.550 --> 26:01.281
- I'll actually take
some potato skins.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.152
(Chuckling)

26:03.190 --> 26:04.851
Is that the wolf or
was that you?

26:04.890 --> 26:05.857
- Does it matter?

26:05.890 --> 26:06.982
The day before the day

26:07.030 --> 26:08.850
we're a little
of both, aren't we?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.356
You should
try it sometime.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.938
- No, that's not
really my style.

26:13.970 --> 26:16.632
- It's not just
about getting laid.

26:16.670 --> 26:20.402
It's about grabbing life
by the throat.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.171
And making it sing.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.171
That's why they hate us,
you know?

26:28.220 --> 26:31.087
Vampires are dead
and we're alive,

26:31.120 --> 26:35.079
so they beat us
and they kick us everyday

26:35.120 --> 26:38.283
until our friend, the moon,
gets nice and fat.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.526
Then it's our turn.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.654
We get to sit on the throne

26:42.700 --> 26:45.567
and shove their faces
into the street.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.991
Do you have any idea what
the 2 of us can do to them

26:49.040 --> 26:51.099
this time of the month?

26:51.140 --> 26:54.201
- Not all vampires are bad.

26:55.210 --> 26:57.076
- Aiden's different.

26:57.110 --> 26:59.670
- Aiden is different.

27:01.020 --> 27:04.615
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.986
To the wolf.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.909
(Chuckling)

27:13.360 --> 27:14.430
- To the wolf.

27:14.460 --> 27:19.000
* Yeah 'cause you wanna
tear me apart *

27:19.030 --> 27:20.623
(Siren in distance)

27:23.640 --> 27:27.235
* You don't just want
to break me *

27:27.270 --> 27:30.240
* You wanna tear me apart **

27:31.610 --> 27:33.408
(Sighing)

27:33.450 --> 27:34.849
(Sniffing)

27:34.880 --> 27:36.177
(Siren in distance)

27:38.620 --> 27:40.179
- Great!

27:44.990 --> 27:47.254
Where's my blood?
Where's my blood?

27:50.560 --> 27:53.666
- I'm sorry, man. I had to
make room for those beauties.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.031
- Where is it?

27:55.070 --> 27:56.469
- It was an
emergency, man.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.810
You know, I didn't want
my "rumpers” to go bad.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.001
- Where?

28:00.040 --> 28:01.838
- It's right over there.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.148
I figured you can get some more
down at the hospital, you know,

28:08.180 --> 28:11.639
or just jump someone
down an alley.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.180
(Chuckling)

28:13.220 --> 28:14.688
- Full moon's coming soon.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.882
- Yep! Can't wait for it.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.753
- Yeah, it's been great,
the help you've given Josh,

28:19.790 --> 28:22.452
but you will be
moving on after this moon.

28:22.500 --> 28:26.095
- Yeah, I bet you like that, huh?
- It'd be for the best.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.167
Your welcome's wearing
a bit thin here.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.238
- Josh might have something
different to say about that.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.829
- Josh will do what's right.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.702
- Who's to say
what's right, huh?

28:34.740 --> 28:38.608
Some guy who's actually
shown him how to survive,

28:38.650 --> 28:40.505
how to thrive,

28:40.550 --> 28:44.544
or some undead thing

28:44.590 --> 28:47.855
that lets him
tag along like a pet.

28:47.890 --> 28:53.226
It's only a matter of time before he
realizes and sees you for the leech you are.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.957
- Oh, you picked the wrong time
to screw with me, Ray.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.162
- What are you gonna do?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.861
Rip me to shreds
in this kitchen

28:59.900 --> 29:01.629
and prove to
your friend, Josh,

29:01.670 --> 29:05.129
what a murderous scum
we both know you to be?

29:15.780 --> 29:18.841
- (Josh): Is a bagel good
for a hangover?

29:18.890 --> 29:20.380
(Heart beating)

29:21.360 --> 29:22.953
Aiden.

29:24.790 --> 29:26.884
Aiden?

29:31.370 --> 29:32.519
- Uh, what?

29:32.570 --> 29:34.789
(Cash register beeping)

29:34.840 --> 29:35.796
- Hi.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.207
- Doe eyes.
How are you?

29:38.240 --> 29:39.708
- Fine.

29:39.740 --> 29:43.734
I haven't been screamed at
by any nurses in a month or so.

29:43.780 --> 29:47.410
- Yeah. I'm--
I'm sorry about that.

29:47.450 --> 29:49.441
It was a monster
of a day,

29:49.480 --> 29:52.188
and honestly,
it wasn't your fault.

29:52.220 --> 29:55.713
- (Woman on PA): Dr. Brown,
please pick up line 5.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.012
(Clears throat)

29:57.060 --> 30:01.099
- It's really fine. Let me buy
you a-- Let me buy you a coffee.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.097
- Oh, that's OK.

30:02.130 --> 30:04.019
- No, please.
I insist.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.469
- Thank you.
- Of course.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.059
- Um, I'll get
the next one.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.067
- All right.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.569
Uh...

30:10.600 --> 30:13.035
So, are you hungry?

30:13.070 --> 30:14.572
'Cause I am.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.931
But what I want

30:16.980 --> 30:20.041
ain't on this menu.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.912
- What menu?

30:21.950 --> 30:25.341
- Listen, I know you're
as busy as you are hot,

30:25.390 --> 30:27.381
so I'm gonna make
this "swort and sheet".

30:27.420 --> 30:30.879
Short and sweet.

30:32.190 --> 30:33.897
What time
do you get off?

30:33.930 --> 30:35.557
- Why?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.295
- 'Cause I want
to take you out,

30:37.330 --> 30:39.492
buy you a drink...

30:40.270 --> 30:42.068
maybe 2, maybe 3...

30:43.070 --> 30:44.367
and 4.

30:45.740 --> 30:48.937
And just see
what happens.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.608
- And what do you think
is gonna happen?

30:51.650 --> 30:55.018
- Well, I'm willing to bet
that after that drink...

30:56.820 --> 30:58.788
or 4,

30:58.820 --> 31:01.619
we end up in sex.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.782
In bed. Sexing in bed.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.992
Or whatever.

31:08.030 --> 31:12.126
- Wow! Um, that's
pretty just-- (Chuckles)

31:12.170 --> 31:14.229
Wow! Um, what's your name?

31:14.270 --> 31:15.567
- Josh.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.910
- Josh. Right, yeah.

31:17.940 --> 31:21.729
Um, I'd like to continue
this conversation.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.802
- Really?

31:24.850 --> 31:29.071
- But I'm incredibly busy.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.681
So busy, in fact, that I don't have
time to go to Human Resources

31:32.720 --> 31:35.519
- and tell them what
a disgusting, harassing cretin

31:35.560 --> 31:36.914
they have working here
as an orderly.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.782
So, let's just say you talk
to me again, it's your ass.

31:39.830 --> 31:42.094
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.265
(Sighing)

31:44.300 --> 31:45.620
- What was that?

31:45.670 --> 31:48.037
- What? I was channelling
my inner wolf,

31:48.070 --> 31:51.506
- OK. So the wolf never wants
to have sex again either.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.406
Who taught you
this crap? Ray?

31:53.440 --> 31:55.374
- Ray? My friend, Ray?
Yeah, he did.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.139
He taught me
a lot of things.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.148
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.648
Tell you what,
when you're off tonight,

32:00.680 --> 32:03.012
wherever you've been for the
past who knows how many nights,

32:03.050 --> 32:05.382
maybe it'll come to you.

32:06.850 --> 32:10.787
- You commit dating suicide
and suddenly it's about me?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.592
(Siren in distance)

32:22.370 --> 32:24.407
(Door slamming)

32:25.110 --> 32:26.464
- Am I a jerk?

32:28.710 --> 32:30.530
- Why would I think that?

32:30.580 --> 32:33.971
- I use my otherworldly powers
to destroy relationships.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.512
I'm a jerk, right?

32:39.790 --> 32:41.815
(Sighing)

32:43.090 --> 32:44.683
- Danny?

32:45.330 --> 32:46.820
(Sighing)

32:46.860 --> 32:48.851
- Why did it have
to be Bridget?

32:51.600 --> 32:53.022
(Inhaling)

32:53.070 --> 32:56.495
- You love Danny, right?

32:56.540 --> 32:58.304
And Briget?

32:58.340 --> 33:02.208
- When she's not rubbing her
bits all over my fiance,

33:02.240 --> 33:04.004
yeah, she's the best.

33:04.050 --> 33:07.771
- So what could be better
than 2 people that you love

33:07.810 --> 33:10.472
coming together over the love
that they share for you?

33:10.520 --> 33:13.888
- They're not sharing
the love, Mr. Hallmark.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.854
They're dancing
on my grave.

33:15.890 --> 33:17.415
- Sally.

33:18.360 --> 33:23.594
(Sighing) This life
gets bitterly cold.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.122
Sometimes you just
need to cling to the person

33:26.170 --> 33:28.935
that you can claw your way
out of the dark with.

33:28.970 --> 33:34.534
Danny and Bridget,
they may not be kismet,

33:34.580 --> 33:37.572
but we all deserve
a shot at a normal life.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.442
They do, you do.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.448
- You do.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.948
(Sighing)

33:43.980 --> 33:45.584
- Maybe.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.481
(* Humming *)

33:54.530 --> 33:56.794
- (Sally, echoing):
Bridget, it's OK.

33:56.830 --> 33:57.956
(* Stops humming *)

33:59.230 --> 34:00.561
(* Humming *)

34:00.600 --> 34:03.570
Bridget, I know you
probably can't hear me, but...

34:05.940 --> 34:07.999
I don't know
what else to do.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.274
I need you to know
that it's OK.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.149
I get it.

34:14.179 --> 34:17.571
Please, go to him.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.920
- Hello?
Is someone there?

34:32.100 --> 34:34.239
- This place is really nice.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.060
- Yeah.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.659
And it's been
around forever.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.600
Uh, I think
they redecorated.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.577
- The food looks good.

34:47.449 --> 34:51.512
Really colourful.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.351
(Chuckling)

34:54.389 --> 34:55.289
(Inhaling)

34:55.320 --> 34:56.810
(Cutlery clattering)

34:58.360 --> 35:00.089
Aiden.

35:00.130 --> 35:02.019
- Just, uh, just try.

35:03.030 --> 35:04.919
(Both sighing)

35:13.240 --> 35:15.277
(Rumbling)

35:22.020 --> 35:23.579
(Heart beating)

35:24.920 --> 35:26.115
(Crunching)

35:31.730 --> 35:35.291
- Uh, so, how was
your day anyway?

35:35.330 --> 35:37.594
** All alone in the city *

35:37.630 --> 35:39.291
(Both panting)

35:39.330 --> 35:41.367
* It's like I found my mind *

35:41.400 --> 35:43.459
(Siren in distance)

35:43.500 --> 35:45.309
* Broken bottles *

35:45.340 --> 35:47.707
* And broken bones *

35:47.740 --> 35:50.573
* Keep dreaming
on the edge of the night *

35:50.610 --> 35:51.941
(Both moaning)

35:51.980 --> 35:53.948
<i>* I don't wanna go *</i>

35:53.980 --> 35:57.575
<i>* I don't wanna go back to
the city... ** - School is over.</i>

35:57.620 --> 36:01.409
You have absorbed every morsel
of knowledge I have to offer.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.882
(Both chuckling)

36:02.920 --> 36:04.820
- Thanks, Ray.
I mean that.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.625
- What do you say
we celebrate, eh?

36:07.660 --> 36:09.458
- Yeah, all right.

36:10.230 --> 36:11.664
Where are we?

36:11.700 --> 36:13.259
- Shhh!

36:14.240 --> 36:16.060
See that place?

36:17.070 --> 36:19.368
They gorge
themselves in there.

36:19.410 --> 36:20.468
- Who?

36:20.510 --> 36:21.909
- Who do you think?

36:21.940 --> 36:26.776
They get so stuffed with blood,
they actually get stoned.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.141
Filthy pigs.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.478
- Vampires? There are
vampires in there?

36:30.520 --> 36:32.784
- Yeah. See, this is
the kind of stuff

36:32.820 --> 36:36.654
your boy, Aiden, is not gonna be telling you about.
- Come on!

36:36.690 --> 36:39.489
- That's why I want you
to know everything

36:39.530 --> 36:41.828
that these leeches
are capable of!

36:41.860 --> 36:43.419
Quit running!

36:43.460 --> 36:45.929
- I really don't think
we should be here.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.964
- This is absolutely where we
need to be tonight while we're strong!

36:51.910 --> 36:54.004
I'm proud of you, boy.

36:54.040 --> 36:58.034
You're gonna follow my
lead, and enjoy the party.

37:01.650 --> 37:04.585
Ready to pop
some ticks?

37:04.620 --> 37:06.145
(Chuckling)

37:06.190 --> 37:07.146
<i>Excuse me!</i>

37:07.190 --> 37:08.453
- Wait!

37:08.490 --> 37:10.709
- Excuse me, sir.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.058
- No, thanks. I'm full.

37:13.090 --> 37:14.455
(Groaning)

37:14.500 --> 37:15.649
- Ray!

37:15.700 --> 37:17.623
(Grunting)

37:17.660 --> 37:20.061
(Ray laughing)

37:21.770 --> 37:22.737
(Laughing)

37:22.770 --> 37:26.400
(Thudding and Ray grunting)

37:30.140 --> 37:31.904
Ray, he's--

37:31.950 --> 37:34.100
- What? He's dead!

37:34.150 --> 37:36.073
He died a long time ago.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.214
How can you just stand there?

37:38.250 --> 37:39.945
Don't you want some payback?

37:39.990 --> 37:43.210
A little retribution for
all the crap we had to take

37:43.260 --> 37:45.228
from pieces of
garbage like this?

37:45.260 --> 37:48.855
Day in, day out.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.460
(Ray shouting, indistinct)

37:51.500 --> 37:54.367
- Well, look at this.

37:55.370 --> 37:58.135
A couple of strays.

37:58.170 --> 37:59.365
- You want a piece of this?

37:59.410 --> 38:01.003
- Ray, let's go!

38:01.040 --> 38:03.407
- I think I have
a little room left.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.704
- Oh!

38:05.750 --> 38:08.447
- Well, that just
leaves you and I'm--

38:17.190 --> 38:19.830
- Ray, we need to get
the hell out of here now!

38:19.860 --> 38:22.352
- Hey, you're not
the only one that bites!

38:22.400 --> 38:23.993
(Growling)

38:25.800 --> 38:28.462
(All grunting)

38:34.480 --> 38:35.834
(Teeth clicking)

38:35.880 --> 38:39.305
- Wait!
Get out of here now!

38:39.350 --> 38:40.977
- He's mine!

38:41.010 --> 38:42.876
- We gotta go!
Come on!

38:44.520 --> 38:45.919
- That's it, Josh!

38:45.950 --> 38:47.918
Tear him apart!

38:47.950 --> 38:50.453
(Growling)

38:54.800 --> 38:56.996
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.028
(Moans)

38:59.800 --> 39:01.393
It's OK.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.364
- All right. Well, what's OK?
- This. Us.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.502
We don't have
to feel guilty.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.099
I think Sally
tried to tell me.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.404
- Tell you? What-- -
I... I guess. I don't know.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.772
I felt something.
A feeling of peace.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.539
- Wait, wait. What?

39:14.720 --> 39:16.370
- I think it was her.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.283
(Sighing)

39:27.190 --> 39:29.090
- I can't do this anymore.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.222
- Hey, sweetheart.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.227
- I can't.

39:31.260 --> 39:32.466
- It's OK, it's OK.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.127
I brought you some.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.237
I am not a monster,
neither are you.

39:38.270 --> 39:39.704
- But we are!

39:41.140 --> 39:43.370
<i>We are!</i>

39:55.960 --> 39:57.655
(Tap running)

39:59.990 --> 40:03.324
Everyday is gonna make us
want to rip our fingernails out

40:03.360 --> 40:05.897
if we have to keep
living like this.

40:07.770 --> 40:10.637
I can't go to a restaurant
and pretend to be human,

40:10.670 --> 40:14.334
when all I want to do
is eat the table next to me.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.769
(Sniffling)

40:15.810 --> 40:17.938
I'm not that strong.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.573
(Tap stops running)

40:19.610 --> 40:22.045
- I will be strong
for both of us.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.189
I've been here before.

40:28.050 --> 40:31.623
When you wake up in the morning,
you will feel better.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.538
- Hey, guys!

40:43.570 --> 40:45.368
It's Danny!

40:53.510 --> 40:55.114
Sally?

40:59.220 --> 41:00.312
(Danny sighing)

41:00.350 --> 41:02.455
** Everyone's raining *
Are you here?

41:02.490 --> 41:05.482
* Everyone's pouring *

41:05.530 --> 41:07.988
(Chuckling)

41:11.330 --> 41:15.563
* Everyone's hailing
Everyone's storming * Sally, I--

41:20.640 --> 41:22.972
* Everyone's raging *

41:23.010 --> 41:25.445
* Everyone's r oaring *
Are you here?

41:30.720 --> 41:33.485
* Everyone's raining *

41:33.520 --> 41:36.160
* Everyone's pouring *

41:38.960 --> 41:41.349
* My love **

41:42.360 --> 41:44.761
(Car honking in distance)

41:46.800 --> 41:50.464
- You should've seen the look
on his face when I bit him.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.468
I mean, you know,
there's surprise

41:52.510 --> 41:56.401
and there there's this-guy- almost-bit
my-cheek-off kind of surprise.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.532
(Chuckling)

41:57.580 --> 41:59.400
- I can't believe
I just did that.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.009
- You need a beer, my friend.

42:02.850 --> 42:06.741
- S-s-seriously,
I don't do things like that.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.589
I don't-- I don't
beat men in alleys.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.418
- Those weren't men.

42:16.500 --> 42:18.320
Be honest, though.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.397
Felt good, didn't it?

42:23.940 --> 42:25.863
Hey, look at me.

42:27.510 --> 42:31.071
Hey. H . e onr

42:31.110 --> 42:32.475
- It's all right.

42:33.450 --> 42:35.009
You all right?

42:37.280 --> 42:39.317
I have been
watching you, Josh.

42:40.450 --> 42:41.815
And what I saw tonight...

42:41.860 --> 42:43.180
(Chuckles)

42:43.220 --> 42:48.556
...that look on your face when
you were tearing that leech up...

42:48.600 --> 42:50.921
there was joy
in there.

42:50.960 --> 42:54.999
You enjoyed it
deep, deep down

42:55.040 --> 42:56.690
where the wolf lives.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.903
You know it felt good.

42:59.940 --> 43:01.101
(Sniffling)

43:10.680 --> 43:13.786
** Wolves and
werewolves, baby *

43:13.820 --> 43:16.357
* Scratchin' at your door *

43:20.960 --> 43:23.520
* Said there's wolves
and werewolves, baby *

43:23.560 --> 43:26.097
* Scratchin' at your door *

43:30.370 --> 43:32.566
* I think I fed 'em earlier *

43:32.610 --> 43:35.136
* I don't know what
they're here for... **
