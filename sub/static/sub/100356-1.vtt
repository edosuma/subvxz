00:03.367 --> 00:03.767
- I don't even know

00:03.767 --> 00:04.233

00:09.000 --> 00:11.533
- The only person I'm having

- Do you even know me?

00:13.266 --> 00:14.600
Do you even ----ing
know me, dude?

00:14.633 --> 00:17.367
- This was years of friendship

00:17.400 --> 00:19.367
that I thought
would last forever.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.467
- ♪ These are the best days

00:23.500 --> 00:25.367
- You're being an obnoxious
person right now.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.133
- Katie, you're just
a bitch to me all the time.

00:27.166 --> 00:30.100
- You can't be real
for one second, Kristen.

00:30.133 --> 00:32.266
- Suddenly,
everything kind of...

00:32.300 --> 00:34.133
turned upside down.

00:34.166 --> 00:38.000
- ♪ Just raise

00:38.033 --> 00:40.233
- So, you're not exclusively
dating this girl?

00:40.266 --> 00:41.433
- I'm interested in you.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.166
- Were you guys
hanging out alone?

00:43.200 --> 00:45.066
- I mean, it's great
to have new faces,

00:45.100 --> 00:46.600
but their problems seem

00:46.633 --> 00:49.233
as complicated as
their predecessors.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.066
- Knocking me the (BLEEP) out.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.367
- You have never been happy
in your ----ing life.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.266
- Woman to woman, be careful.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.133
- If you don't love me for
who I am, then bye-bye.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.633
- This is called
a dysfunctional relationship.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.300
- Look at her in the eyes
and tell her you don't

01:00.333 --> 01:02.066
have feelings for her.
- I don't!

01:02.100 --> 01:04.400
- You selfish, egotistical
piece of sh--.

01:04.433 --> 01:07.333
- I just wanna get

01:07.367 --> 01:08.400

01:55.166 --> 01:56.567
Can we get the bar lights
on underneath for me?

01:56.600 --> 01:58.266
- Jojo, make yourself
useful and whatnot.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.567
- Both Tom's are coming
and so are Lisa,

01:59.600 --> 02:01.367
so this place needs
to be perfect.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.367

02:09.233 --> 02:10.300

good tonight.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.600
- Guys, we're opening up.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.333
Table five doesn't
have lights on.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.400
If it's not me,
it's gonna be Lisa,

02:14.433 --> 02:16.700
so choose who you want.

02:16.734 --> 02:18.300
- Looking like
James Bond and whatnot.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.500
- Yeah, "GQ."
- What's up?

02:19.533 --> 02:20.600
- What's up?
- What's up?

02:20.633 --> 02:22.467
- How we doing tonight?

02:22.500 --> 02:24.100
- Rather large party, but are
these your friends for 20?

02:24.133 --> 02:25.500
- Uh, I know them.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.100
Um, it's basically
a bachelorette party.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.600
- Pretty easy, but--okay.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.266
- I told them specifically
not to bring, like,

02:30.300 --> 02:32.066
inflatable penises.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.300
- You'd be surprised the
amount of inflatable penises

02:33.333 --> 02:35.100
I've seen since
I've worked here.

02:35.133 --> 02:37.200
- TomTom has been open
for almost a year now,

02:37.233 --> 02:38.567
and it's busier than ever.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.700
It just feels good
to walk into my bar

02:40.734 --> 02:43.467
and just feel like
I run this place,

02:43.500 --> 02:45.367
except, you know,
when Lisa's here.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.500
Then she runs the place.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.667
- Looks good tonight?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.367
- Yeah, man,
everything's great.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.600
You know, obviously
we got that party of 20.

02:51.633 --> 02:53.233
It should be cool though.

02:53.266 --> 02:55.166
- The reason TomTom
runs so smoothly

02:55.200 --> 02:58.266
is because we've hired
the best staff on the planet.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.233
- I'm sorry, are we working?
Are we twerking?

03:02.266 --> 03:03.734
Okay, just, like, get to work.
- Twerk out.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.700
- We got Dayna,
who's this great worker.

03:05.734 --> 03:08.166
So good in fact that
Lisa's poaching her

03:08.200 --> 03:09.233
to work at Sur.

03:09.266 --> 03:11.200
And then, there's Max.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.266
He is the glue that
holds it all together.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.667
- Dude, I know we had
some drinks last night,

03:15.700 --> 03:17.133
but I left a little early.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.333
What'd you end up doing?

03:18.367 --> 03:20.233
- You guys, guess who I,

03:20.266 --> 03:22.266
you know...with last night?
- Who?

03:22.300 --> 03:24.100
- I'm scared.

03:24.133 --> 03:26.200
- Max.

03:26.233 --> 03:27.734
Don't judge me.

03:27.767 --> 03:29.600
- I--I stayed--I stayed
a little bit longer,

03:29.633 --> 03:31.233
and just had a couple
more drinks,

03:31.266 --> 03:32.633
then I ended up going home.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.400
- He literally has
a new girl every week.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.433
Why else does he have this job?

03:36.467 --> 03:39.133
- Look at these little babies
I got for you guys.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.533
- Honestly, I can
still see myself

03:40.567 --> 03:41.767
getting pretty wasted
with one of these.

03:43.166 --> 03:45.333
All right, cheers, guys.

03:45.367 --> 03:46.700
- Are you sure Barbie
doesn't want those back

03:46.734 --> 03:48.233
for her dream house?

03:48.266 --> 03:49.400
- She might.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.533
- Here are the secrets
to working at Sur:

04:04.567 --> 04:07.300
The girls, just know,
are very catty.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.567
They like new tall, cute boys.
- Of course.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.200
- All of the girls,
if they haven't already,

04:12.233 --> 04:14.300
are probably gonna try and,
like, hook up with you,

04:14.333 --> 04:16.200
because you're really
good-looking.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.433
So, I'm divorced.
I don't know if you know that.

04:17.467 --> 04:18.667
- No, I did not.
- Not a big deal.

04:18.700 --> 04:19.734
Doesn't define me.
- Oh, wow.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.700
- Uh, Lisa: very particular.

04:21.734 --> 04:24.166
Know how she likes her tea.
How does she like her tea?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.433
You're in for a fun summer.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.367
- Right, keys inside.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.633
- Where's your section?

04:34.667 --> 04:36.567
- Um, pink room, right here.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.400
- Oh.

04:38.433 --> 04:39.767
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.266
- Are you liking it?
- I'm having fun.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.333
This is my 16th shift.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.533
I feel like my pageant training

04:46.567 --> 04:48.767
has really prepared me
to work here.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.467
- Okay, I've never heard
that one before, but okay.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.266
- Well, because I greet
my tables with confidence

04:54.300 --> 04:56.033
and with a big smile.

04:56.066 --> 05:00.500
- Raquel requested to work
at Sur so many times,

05:00.533 --> 05:03.033
and I wasn't sure that
I really wanted to get involved

05:03.066 --> 05:05.000
in this complicated dynamic,

05:05.033 --> 05:08.467
because I had to close
the door on James Kennedy.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.567
Maybe your future...

05:10.600 --> 05:13.734
doesn't include Sur.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.367
How does he feel,

05:15.400 --> 05:17.600
like, with you being here
and him not?

05:17.633 --> 05:19.367
- It's definitely
a trigger for him.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.367
He sees me put on
my Sur uniform,

05:21.400 --> 05:23.600
and he's, like, about to cry

05:23.633 --> 05:25.767
watching me leave
the door, so...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.533
It's kinda like when you're
packing for that road trip,

05:28.567 --> 05:30.667
and you zip open
your suitcase,

05:30.700 --> 05:32.600
and your little puppy
jumps in there

05:32.633 --> 05:35.300
and gives you those
big puppy dog eyes

05:37.000 --> 05:40.233
- Anyway, don't you get
caught up in his naughtiness.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.600
- Thank you very much.
- There you go.

05:44.633 --> 05:45.667
You all set?

05:45.700 --> 05:48.633
- Jax Taylor, this is Brett.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.066
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- He's new.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.400
- How are ya?
- What's up, man?

05:51.433 --> 05:53.233
What's your name? Brett?
- Brett.

05:53.266 --> 05:54.567
- Brett. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.367
- New blood in here.
- New blood, man.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.000
- That's nice to see,
'cause I don't think

05:58.033 --> 05:59.433
there's anybody else in here
besides you and me.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.500
Sur has changed dramatically.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.700
- Katie, Lala,
Ariana, and Brittany

06:03.734 --> 06:05.367
all don't work at Sur anymore.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.767
- Basically just leaves me.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.433
Someone's gotta pay
for this wedding.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.500
Are you guys dating
already, or...

06:10.533 --> 06:12.533
- We just met this
weekend, Jesus.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.066
- Exactly. Are you guys
dating already?

06:14.100 --> 06:15.600
- No.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.533
Scheana and I actually
have hooked up.

06:17.567 --> 06:20.567
A few nights ago, we were out
in a bar in Santa Monica.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.100
I was with a buddy.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.633
She of course invited us
back to her house

06:23.667 --> 06:25.400
to play "Scattergories."

06:25.433 --> 06:27.633
The next thing I know,
we just kissed.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.000
That wasn't what
I thought it would be.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.066
Nothing against her.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.000
- That is what I'm saying.

06:35.033 --> 06:36.533
- Have you gotten
her résumé yet?

06:36.567 --> 06:38.500
Her personal résumé, I mean.
- Yeah.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.000
- There was a barback I had
a fling with last summer.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.000
It's nothing now.
- Oh.

06:42.033 --> 06:43.734
He wasn't even a bartender?
- Hence why I'm still single.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.667
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

06:45.700 --> 06:48.467
I have not talked to Adam Spott
in a couple of months.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.533
I did briefly date Max,
the GM at TomTom,

06:52.567 --> 06:55.066
but then he just ghosted me.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.000
I literally bought him
an Apple Watch

06:57.033 --> 06:58.533
to show him how much
I cared about him,

06:58.567 --> 07:00.734
and he couldn't even
use it to text me.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.533
- I don't know if you're looking
for a relationship or not,

07:02.567 --> 07:05.400
but I suggest you
do not get into one.

07:05.433 --> 07:07.700
These girls get a little sleazy
in here around 12:00

07:07.734 --> 07:10.300
- Oh, I'll make sure to be here.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.567
- Beer, wine, cocktails,
as well as the food menu.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.500
- What up?
- How is your night going?

07:24.533 --> 07:26.367
You seem really tired.
Do you need a nap?

07:26.400 --> 07:28.066
Why are you so tired?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.433
- I went out last night.
Weren't you there?

07:30.467 --> 07:32.300
- Are we not supposed
to be talking about it?

07:32.333 --> 07:35.100
I mean, we didn't say anything
when you left today, so...

07:35.133 --> 07:37.000
- Well, you gotta keep in mind
that, like, I'm your--

07:37.033 --> 07:38.133
like, I'm your guys's boss,
you know what I mean?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.133
- Well, I'm moving to Sur, so...

07:40.166 --> 07:42.367
I know Max probably doesn't
wanna be put on blast at work,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.467
but he's going
commando right now,

07:44.500 --> 07:48.066
because his underwear are on
the floor at my house, so...

07:48.100 --> 07:49.433
- It's just like,
people are gonna talk,

07:49.467 --> 07:50.734
and then you're going to Sur.

07:50.767 --> 07:53.033
I've hooked up with
girls there too.

07:53.066 --> 07:54.600
- So, when I go to Sur,
I shouldn't wear

07:54.633 --> 07:56.500
a T-shirt that says,
"I ----ed Max. How about you?"

07:56.533 --> 07:58.066
- I would probably
keep that on the DL,

07:58.100 --> 07:59.567
just for the first
couple weeks.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.066
- Okay, okay.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.333
Why don't you go
manage something?

08:03.367 --> 08:05.433
- Okay, you're ----ing--

08:05.467 --> 08:06.600
this is already too much.

08:06.633 --> 08:08.600
- Bye.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.533
- How's wedding planning?

08:10.567 --> 08:11.767
- Pretty much done.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.066
- Did you have
a bachelor party yet?

08:13.100 --> 08:14.734
- Um, I had a get-together

08:14.767 --> 08:16.433
for my friends that
couldn't make it to Miami,

08:16.467 --> 08:18.100
'cause my bachelor
party's in Miami.

08:18.133 --> 08:20.734
Um, I thought Tom Sandoval
was gonna come.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.667
I texted him the other day,
and I was just like,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.600
"Listen, I love you, man,
but I hate cutting you out.

08:24.633 --> 08:26.467
I hate calling you, and you
don't even return my texts."

08:26.500 --> 08:28.767
And then he still
didn't text me back.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.533
What are we, children?

08:30.567 --> 08:33.600
After not hearing
from Tom for weeks,

08:33.633 --> 08:36.000
I go, "Hey, man, listen,
I know you're incredibly slammed

08:36.033 --> 08:38.100
"with your house
and your projects,

08:38.133 --> 08:39.633
"so I'm going to change up
my wedding party a little bit.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.200
That way, it keeps
the pressure off you."

08:41.233 --> 08:43.133
I was kinda looking out
for him.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.033
"I'm just going to keep
Schwartz as my best man.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.533
I barely hear
from you anymore."

08:46.567 --> 08:47.767
- Is he still one
of your best men?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
- No.
- Oh.

08:50.033 --> 08:51.667
- Have you still been demoted?

08:51.700 --> 08:54.100
- Yeah, I mean, you guys had
that pre-bachelor party.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.633
But as that was getting planned,
I explained to him, I was like,

08:56.667 --> 08:58.734
"Dude, I can't make it.
Like, I gotta see my family.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.667
I haven't seen them
in a really long time."

09:00.700 --> 09:03.667
Because I didn't
cancel my flight

09:03.700 --> 09:06.133
back to see my mom
for Mother's Day,

09:06.166 --> 09:08.500
and go to his
pre-bachelor party,

09:08.533 --> 09:10.767
which isn't a thing,
by the way,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.567
he demoted me to a groomsman
from best man.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.133
(BLEEP) off, dude.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.000
- It feels like
he's, like, sort of,

09:18.033 --> 09:19.533
drifted away from you
or something.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.133
- I'm not trying to
make it about me,

09:21.166 --> 09:22.667
but it is about me.
- It is about you.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.400
- First of all,
it's always about you.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.767
But especially this
summer, absolutely.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.233
- ♪ Uh, uh, uh ♪

09:30.433 --> 09:32.667
♪ Champagne for breakfast ♪

09:32.700 --> 09:34.500
♪ Riding a wave
to the bitter end ♪

09:34.533 --> 09:39.533
♪ And you can't hold me down ♪

09:39.567 --> 09:41.033
- You want something to drink?

09:41.066 --> 09:42.734
- Is the Pope Catholic?

09:42.767 --> 09:44.467
- ♪ Uh-uh ♪
- ♪ Can't hold me ♪

09:44.500 --> 09:45.734
- ♪ Absolutely not ♪

09:45.767 --> 09:47.667
- ♪ You can't hold me down ♪

09:47.700 --> 09:49.033
♪ Can't hold me down ♪

09:49.066 --> 09:50.567
- ♪ Nope ♪

09:50.600 --> 09:52.066
- ♪ Can't hold me down ♪

09:52.100 --> 09:53.433
- I feel like I'm showing
everyone my vag

09:53.467 --> 09:56.000
when I sit down and stand up.

09:56.033 --> 09:58.066
- I like that.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.233
Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.233
I just feel like I have
to compartmentalize.

10:03.266 --> 10:06.467
I can't, like, live
in darkness 24/7.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.033
Life has been really good.

10:10.066 --> 10:12.033
I mean, I have my book,

10:12.066 --> 10:14.233
and it's a "New York Times"
bestseller.

10:14.266 --> 10:16.133
I have Beau.

10:16.166 --> 10:19.066
And then, I get the call today

10:19.100 --> 10:21.133
that my grandmother
passed away,

10:21.166 --> 10:23.500
and it's just--

10:23.533 --> 10:25.100
it's sobering.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.734
You have, like,
so many grandchildren

10:26.767 --> 10:28.233
and great-grandchildren...
- Right.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.734
- But I've always
been your fave.

10:29.767 --> 10:32.533
- Yes.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.133
I love you.
- Yes. I love you too.

10:35.166 --> 10:38.233
- She really is, like,
what I would want to be

10:38.266 --> 10:41.734
if I could just be
a little less bitchy.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.467
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.266
I think the boys wanna
see you over there...

10:46.300 --> 10:48.667
- Oh. I'm gonna--I'll--
I will definitely go.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.600
- All right.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.700
- I'm so sorry.

10:55.734 --> 10:57.467
- I don't know how
to feel right now.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.734
People are congratulating me
as I walk in here,

10:59.767 --> 11:02.533
and saying how proud they are
of me about my book.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.767
- She knew that your book
was a bestseller?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.567
- Yes, she knew everything.
She made me come to her--

11:06.600 --> 11:10.100
- Well, then that's it,
isn't it?

11:10.133 --> 11:11.567
- Yeah.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.000
- 'Cause, you know,
you are her legacy.

11:14.033 --> 11:16.100
It makes me so proud
to see her

11:16.133 --> 11:18.734
as a "New York Times"
bestselling author,

11:18.767 --> 11:22.200
even if it is called, what,
"The Best Bitch"--

11:22.233 --> 11:25.533
"Basic Bitch" or something.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.734
I don't--I don't know.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.233
But, whatever it was called,

11:29.266 --> 11:31.633
she's a bestselling bitch.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.533
- Let's just talk sh--
about people or something,

11:33.567 --> 11:35.100
because that would
make me feel better.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.533
- Talking about that,
how's your best friend?

11:36.567 --> 11:38.300
- Oh, you're talking
about Kristen?

11:38.333 --> 11:41.100
I've been really frustrated,
because the way she speaks,

11:41.133 --> 11:43.633
it's like, "Katie and Stassi
are horrible friends.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.300
They don't support me
in my relationship."

11:45.333 --> 11:47.133
Or, "They haven't
checked in on me."

11:47.166 --> 11:49.600
And I feel like she's
been telling everyone

11:49.633 --> 11:52.166
that she's broken up
with her boyfriend.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.667
She, in the same breath, says,

11:53.700 --> 11:55.567
"But we still live together,

11:55.600 --> 11:57.100
have sex with each other,
and hang out every day."

11:57.133 --> 11:59.533
And I just feel like
she's lying to me.

11:59.567 --> 12:03.767
Kristen and I have had our
fair share of ups and downs,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.066
but this feels different.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.066
- I sit at home alone,
and I ----ing cry,

12:08.100 --> 12:09.633
and I'm scared
to ----ing call you,

12:09.667 --> 12:11.266
because you guys
are annoyed by me.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.166
- Kristen, come on.
You came to me, yeah, I--

12:13.200 --> 12:15.367
- Your type of love doesn't
----ing work for me.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.300
- Anyone is gonna lose
their ----ing patience

12:17.333 --> 12:18.767
when their best friend
is coming to them saying,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.233
"I am not happy."

12:20.266 --> 12:22.333
- I don't know that the person

12:22.367 --> 12:25.133
I'm hopefully growing into

12:25.166 --> 12:29.133
can be friends with the person
who's not growing at all.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.333
- I understand
what you're saying.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.200
To me, lying is
my Achilles heel.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.300
If someone lies to me,
that's it, we're ----ing done.

12:34.333 --> 12:37.200
- Yeah. I'm, like,
triggered with liars,

12:37.233 --> 12:39.300
and it just makes me pull away.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.600
I'm not gonna dance this dance.
I'm not gonna play this game.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.767
- Coming up...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.734
- Like, me, Jax Taylor,
is getting married next month.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.400
- Yeah.

12:50.433 --> 12:52.066
- I'm gonna have to have
somebody else as a best man.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.400
- That's a lot of
responsibility,

12:53.433 --> 12:56.133
being best man all by myself.

13:10.133 --> 13:12.200
- I feel like my grandma
would love this.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.100
- Yeah.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.633
- I'm writing her eulogy.
I just wanna do her justice.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.166
- You will.
100% you will.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.133
- You know what, when I die,

13:21.166 --> 13:24.667
I just want it to be, like,
a haunted house theme.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.166
And then, there--there
will be tray passers,

13:27.200 --> 13:29.166
and they're all gonna
look like me...

13:29.200 --> 13:30.767
- Uh-huh.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.100
Yeah, I mean, Stassi
makes everything fun.

13:35.133 --> 13:36.233
No...

13:36.266 --> 13:38.233
- And I wanna be taxidermied,

13:38.266 --> 13:40.333
so that people can come
and take selfies with me.

13:40.367 --> 13:42.100
- 'Cause there's a lot
of things that she likes

13:42.133 --> 13:44.667
that I just--that are
just not fun for me.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.767
- Scheana will literally
move my dead body...

13:48.500 --> 13:50.400
- So that she can take
the selfie on her good side.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.000
- God, that's so messed up.

13:52.033 --> 13:53.400
It creeps me out.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.400
It really does creep me out.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.500
But I smile.

13:57.533 --> 14:00.300
- Well, we're missing Katie
and Tom's housewarming party,

14:00.333 --> 14:02.400
but, I mean, at least
we got to see their house.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.400
I haven't seen Tom and Ariana's
or Jax and Brittany's,

14:04.433 --> 14:07.133
but it looks exactly
like Katie and Tom's.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.133
I mean,
everything is identical.

14:09.166 --> 14:12.200
I can't remember
whose house is whose.

14:12.233 --> 14:14.066
Like, does Schwartz
acknowledge it with Jax?

14:14.100 --> 14:15.400
Like, "Hey,
you have good taste."

14:15.433 --> 14:17.367
"You have good taste."

14:17.400 --> 14:20.433
Like, why is no one like,
"Hey, hm, this is weird.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.734
We have the same house.
Huh."

14:22.767 --> 14:24.367
- Yeah.

14:39.033 --> 14:40.734
- Stay right here.
Stay.

14:44.066 --> 14:48.100
This pillow, why is it so hard?

14:48.133 --> 14:49.266
Oh, my gosh.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.500
- I can't hear you, honey.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.433
- I think this area is gonna be,
like, my breakdance studio.

14:57.467 --> 15:00.300
In fact, we should just lay out,
tape these boxes out.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.100
- Like this one.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.767
- Yeah, there you go.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.433
- Be like...

15:08.400 --> 15:11.133
That's why I need a studio,
so I can practice.

15:14.567 --> 15:18.133
- In 2.5 years--
wait, 2.6 years,

15:18.166 --> 15:20.567
our post-marriage life
has been, like,

15:20.600 --> 15:23.166
so blissful and indulgent.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.100
We've been eating whenever
we want, traveling.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.133
I think it's time to bring
sexy back a little bit.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.166
- It's been the great
West Hollywood migration

15:31.200 --> 15:32.533
to the Valley.

15:32.567 --> 15:34.133
- Or more like everybody
just followed us.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.000
- Or that.

15:36.033 --> 15:38.066
- They were like,
"We'll come find you."

15:38.100 --> 15:41.066
It just goes to show that some
people are leaders in this world

15:41.100 --> 15:44.100
and some people are followers,
and now we know who's who.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.333
I still haven't been over
to Jax and Brittany's place.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.200
I know they, like,
just moved in there.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.467
- There was, like,
a period of time

15:49.500 --> 15:51.333
where I was really
annoyed with Jax,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.367
because, we're looking at
houses, all this kinda stuff,

15:53.400 --> 15:56.266
and everything I said about
the house, he just was like,

15:56.300 --> 15:57.567
it was immediate,
like, one-upper.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.367
And I'm like,
"Dude, this is something

15:59.400 --> 16:01.500
that means the absolute
world to me."

16:01.533 --> 16:03.433
- It's like, "I gotta
try to do it better."

16:03.467 --> 16:05.100
- It's like, "Yeah,
that's good for you guys.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.767
"We just--we need
a little bit more.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.100
"We need to be in, like,
a little bit better school zone,

16:09.133 --> 16:10.500
you know, 'cause we got
plans with kids."

16:10.533 --> 16:13.367
Ariana and I,
getting a house together

16:13.400 --> 16:15.100
is the way that we are, like,

16:15.133 --> 16:16.567
showing our commitment
to each other.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.166
I mean, we're not
getting married.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.400
We're not having kids.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.600
Can't I just have
this one thing

16:21.633 --> 16:25.000
without Jax, like,
sh---ing on it?

16:25.033 --> 16:27.467
- It's almost like
he can't help himself.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.300
- Tom Sandoval and I
don't really have

16:29.333 --> 16:31.266
a lot in common
that much anymore.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.233
- Yeah.
- I kinda think it's like,

16:33.266 --> 16:35.500
"Do you know that I'm--hey,
I'm getting married next month.

16:35.533 --> 16:38.266
Like, me, Jax Taylor is
getting married next month."

16:38.300 --> 16:40.066
- Yeah.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.367
- Like, this is a big
----ing deal. It really sucks.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.266
- I know, I wish
Tom would see that,

16:43.300 --> 16:44.500
and, like, at least try to reach
out and see how you're doing

16:44.533 --> 16:46.266
every now and then.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.633
Jax and Tom have been
through so much.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.333
Jax has done a bunch
of sh-- to Tom...

16:49.367 --> 16:52.100
- You banged Jax.
- Yes, we slept together.

16:52.133 --> 16:55.000
- Did you use protection?
- Once.

16:55.033 --> 16:57.233
- Tom has done a bunch
of sh-- to Jax.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.200
- You ever feel this?
- Oh, my God!

17:00.233 --> 17:02.266
- But at the end of the day,
they've been able

17:02.300 --> 17:04.266
to make it through it and
then still be best friends.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.367
So, I just don't think
this one fight

17:06.400 --> 17:08.600
should ruin everything.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.633
- I'm gonna have to have
somebody else as a best man,

17:10.667 --> 17:12.433
because I need you--

17:12.467 --> 17:14.066
- You don't have to have
somebody else as a best man.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.133
- Well, I don't
really trust Schwartz

17:15.166 --> 17:17.166
to take care of everything.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.467
- Listen, that's a lot of--
that's a lot of responsibility,

17:19.500 --> 17:22.066
being best man all by myself.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.567
I need Sandoval there with me.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.467
- You have to talk
to him at the party.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.266
He's gonna be there.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.166
- I love that I have to go
to a party to find him.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.433
- I told the girls last night,
it's not a housewarming,

17:30.467 --> 17:32.200
it's a house-chilling,

17:32.233 --> 17:33.533
and they were like,
"So, like, pajamas?

17:33.567 --> 17:35.500
And I said, "No,"
what was it, like...

17:35.533 --> 17:37.333
- It's like comfy chic.
- Comfy chic.

17:37.367 --> 17:40.133
Here's my question,
so, who's coming?

17:40.166 --> 17:43.300
Scheana, Max, Britt, Jax, um...

17:43.333 --> 17:45.166
- Kristen.
Are we gonna invite Carter?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.533
- I don't know.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.367
You know, they're still
living together and...

17:48.400 --> 17:50.066
- They still live together?
Why doesn't he--

17:50.100 --> 17:51.600
- Hang out all the time
and sleep together.

17:51.633 --> 17:54.567
It's like, "So, you're just
calling yourselves broken up,

17:54.600 --> 17:56.100
but, like, you're not?"

17:56.133 --> 17:58.033
- I'm gonna leave it up to her,

17:58.066 --> 17:59.300
'cause I feel like that's
the respectful thing to do.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.333
- I do like Kristen's
house, though.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.133
It's nice and cute.
I think it's perfect for her.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.200
- For her and Carter or
just for her?

18:05.233 --> 18:07.133
- Well, that's
a whole nother story.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.633
- I just feel like
I have to go over there.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.400
I don't know--since we're
leaving town tomorrow,

18:10.433 --> 18:12.567
I don't know when else
I could see her.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.567
I just really hope we can
just, like, get to, like,

18:14.600 --> 18:16.567
an honest place,
and just, like,

18:16.600 --> 18:18.533
"if you're trying to make
it work with Carter,

18:18.567 --> 18:21.300
"like, just tell me the truth.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.166
"The only way you would
lose me as a friend

18:23.200 --> 18:24.500
is if you keep lying to me."

18:26.734 --> 18:29.433
- Coming up...
- I reached out to James.

18:29.467 --> 18:33.233
I think he thinks in his mind,
like, I left him behind.

18:33.266 --> 18:35.367
- He needs to get sober.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.767
- ♪ Tick-tock, never stop,
and I got my team ♪

18:47.000 --> 18:50.467
♪ We gonna live the dream,
oh, we gonna live the dream ♪

18:54.567 --> 18:56.467
- Go greet Lala.

18:58.166 --> 19:01.533
I'm a slob,
and you're a princess.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.567
- You've never been
a slob ever in your life.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.433
- Come on, beauty, come here.
- I've missed you.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.467
- Well, I've been
in Vegas, baby.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.166
Ken and I were
kind of exhausted

19:11.200 --> 19:13.166
from opening TomTom.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.467
And then, Caesars came along

19:15.500 --> 19:17.767
to invite us to be
in their establishment.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.266
So, Nick Alain and Ken and I

19:20.300 --> 19:22.667
created the Vanderpump
Cocktail Garden.

19:24.633 --> 19:28.567
I thought I would just make
a low-key entrance...

19:36.033 --> 19:38.233
But Caesars had other ideas.

19:38.266 --> 19:40.500
Come on, Schnook.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.600
No, oh, my God,
he has to shag me

19:42.633 --> 19:45.000
as soon as I give attention
to anybody else.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.700
You have to calm down.
- Wait, has he been fixed?

19:47.734 --> 19:50.600
- Uh, yes, but it's got
nothing to do with that.

19:50.633 --> 19:52.300
- Oh, it doesn't?
They're still horny?

19:52.333 --> 19:53.734
- Oh, yeah.
- Just like Randall.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.233
- Yeah, exactly.

19:56.266 --> 19:57.433
- Well, you know that yesterday,

19:57.467 --> 20:01.266
I hit seven months of sobriety.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.500
Can you believe it?
- Oh, really?

20:02.533 --> 20:03.667
- Yeah.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.600
Sobriety has truly been,

20:05.633 --> 20:08.467
like, the biggest gift
I've ever given to myself.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.200
I'm a happy person.
I don't attack people.

20:11.233 --> 20:13.700
Sit the (BLEEP) down.
- All right, all right!

20:13.734 --> 20:15.700
- We're bonding over the fact
that my dad died,

20:15.734 --> 20:17.300
you ----ing twat.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.333
Get the (BLEEP)
out of my face, ho!

20:19.367 --> 20:21.333
That other version of myself,

20:21.367 --> 20:23.700
I never wanna go
back to her again.

20:23.734 --> 20:25.700
- I'm glad you've
turned the corner.

20:25.734 --> 20:28.200
- Part of being sober, you have
to make amends to people,

20:28.233 --> 20:30.400
so I reached out to James.

20:30.433 --> 20:33.734
I think he thinks in his mind,
like, I left him behind,

20:33.767 --> 20:37.500
but I truly miss him
as my friend.

20:37.533 --> 20:40.667
- Yeah, but you have learned

20:40.700 --> 20:44.367
that the way you were behaving
wasn't acceptable,

20:44.400 --> 20:49.066
and I don't think he quite
has that understanding.

20:49.100 --> 20:51.400
He needs to get sober.

20:51.433 --> 20:55.633
- I don't feel like I can push
my sobriety on other people

20:55.667 --> 20:57.300
and give them advice,

20:57.333 --> 21:00.633
but I want people
to see who James is.

21:00.667 --> 21:03.367
Anyone that deals with me,
Lisa, is a saint.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.533
I moved to L.A., and you took me
into your restaurant

21:05.567 --> 21:09.367
and, like, really
did me a solid.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.533
That meant a lot to me.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.633
- Because I always
believed in you.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.767
- I know, and I
so appreciate that.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.433
- So, um, what do you wanna do?

21:18.467 --> 21:19.667
Well, I wanna see you.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.367
- As you know, back in Utah,

21:21.400 --> 21:23.533
I'm very into
the Humane Society.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.734
Like, what do you need
at Vanderpump Dogs?

21:25.767 --> 21:28.266
- You know what,
we rely on volunteers,

21:28.300 --> 21:31.266
and they would love
to have you there.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.667
Lala was a great
little hostess,

21:33.700 --> 21:36.433
but now she's in a different
place in her life.

21:36.467 --> 21:39.700
I mean, I can't expect her
to kinda get on her private jet

21:39.734 --> 21:43.000
and come here to seat
some people in the VIP.

21:43.033 --> 21:47.400
But Lala has this innate love

21:47.433 --> 21:49.467
for our four-legged
furry friends.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.667
- Whether I'm cleaning up
dog sh-- or...

21:51.700 --> 21:53.400
- Well, you can have
some dog sh--.

21:53.433 --> 21:55.333
We have, like, vending
machines of dog sh--.

21:55.367 --> 21:56.667
- Yum. Yum.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.633
- Why are you knocking?
- It's locked.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.333
- Oh.

22:18.367 --> 22:19.567
- Whoops, sorry.
- Hey.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.700
I forgot, you're packing.
- Trying.

22:21.734 --> 22:23.433
- You really haven't
done a good job.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.133
- Not at all.
- And when do you move?

22:25.166 --> 22:27.433
- I don't know.
- You don't know when you move?

22:27.467 --> 22:28.734
- I have to be out of here in--

22:28.767 --> 22:30.667
what's today--a week.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.700
- Okay, so, well,
that is then a moving date.

22:33.734 --> 22:35.100
- Do you want a drink?

22:35.133 --> 22:37.133
- Kristen knows how to, like,

22:37.166 --> 22:40.033
make her outward appearance fit

22:40.066 --> 22:42.066
whatever she feels like
she's going through,

22:42.100 --> 22:43.700
whereas, like, you know,
when I get upset,

22:43.734 --> 22:47.000
I really like to, like,
go put on some blush,

22:47.033 --> 22:48.700
try and make myself look
a little presentable.

22:48.734 --> 22:53.533
Kristen looks like she's been
crying for days perhaps.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.600
You're stressing me out, man.
- Sorry.

22:55.633 --> 22:57.367
It's all really ----ing sad.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.467
And I tried constantly
with you and Katie,

23:00.500 --> 23:02.600
but it's like, I'm going
through a breakup,

23:02.633 --> 23:04.100
and I just don't hear back.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.734
- Because I feel like
I've been lied to.

23:07.767 --> 23:11.100
You say in public to everyone,

23:11.133 --> 23:12.600
"We're broken up,"

23:12.633 --> 23:15.100
but every single person
in your life knows

23:15.133 --> 23:16.767
that Carter still lives here...
- Yes.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
- That you still see
each other every day...

23:18.633 --> 23:20.166
- Which is up to me.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.033
- That sometimes,
you guys have hooked up...

23:22.066 --> 23:23.633
- Which is also up--yeah--
that's also up to me.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.600
- So, that is up to you?

23:25.633 --> 23:27.333
- My best friends
should just say,

23:27.367 --> 23:28.667
"Whatever is good for you
works for us."

23:28.700 --> 23:30.066
- Kristen, but--
but that does work for us,

23:30.100 --> 23:31.467
if you were to be
honest about it.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.734
You've been saying
you're broken up.

23:32.767 --> 23:34.100
That's not a broken-up
relationship.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.734
- But we are broken up.

23:35.767 --> 23:37.433
It's just not the way
that it works for you,

23:37.467 --> 23:38.467
in your mind of the way
a breakup works.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.667
- Is it working for you?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.767
- I'm figuring it out.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.500
Stassi can look at
a dude and say,

23:45.533 --> 23:47.166
"You know what, we're done."

23:47.200 --> 23:49.166
She might be sad,
but she moves the (BLEEP) on.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.767
I commend her for that,
but it is not who I am.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.033
- Are you gonna be able to not
hang out with me every day?

23:54.066 --> 23:55.533
Is that something that
you're okay with? Like...

23:55.567 --> 23:57.166
- Of course I wanna,
like, kiss you,

23:57.200 --> 23:58.633
and I wanna, like, be with you,

23:58.667 --> 24:00.033
and I wanna, like,
sleep with you,

24:00.066 --> 24:01.767
and I want--
I'm feeling that way,

24:02.000 --> 24:03.400
but I just can't,

24:03.433 --> 24:05.767
'cause it's like,
then I'm a joke.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.533
I literally cannot
imagine just saying,

24:08.567 --> 24:10.700
"Oh, I'll never talk
to Carter again."

24:10.734 --> 24:13.467
- Okay, so, in a week,

24:13.500 --> 24:17.166
when you move out of here,
where's he gonna go?

24:21.700 --> 24:24.600
Halle-freakin'-lujah.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.166
Praise the breakup gods.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.200
- I just really ----ing
miss you.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.734
- I miss you too.

24:37.467 --> 24:39.533
- That's my favorite thing
to do.

24:41.467 --> 24:43.200
- Coming up...

24:43.233 --> 24:45.133
- I'm gonna be honest with you,
like, with Scheana,

24:45.166 --> 24:46.467
I mean, I think we all know
that she's very boy-crazy.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.200
- Yeah.

24:48.233 --> 24:50.066
- I then made the mistake of
hanging out all the time.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.033
I didn't want to, though,
you know what I mean?

24:52.066 --> 24:54.433
But then I realized, I'm like,
"(BLEEP), this is a lot."

24:59.433 --> 24:59.734
- ♪ Brighter ♪

25:01.200 --> 25:03.667
♪ We shine brighter ♪

25:03.700 --> 25:06.266
♪ We shine brighter ♪

25:06.300 --> 25:08.000
♪ Than the sun ♪

25:08.033 --> 25:10.200
- ♪ We got a house,
we got a house ♪

25:10.233 --> 25:12.533
♪ We got a house now,
we got a house ♪

25:12.567 --> 25:15.500
- Because we are now homeowners,

25:15.533 --> 25:18.266
we have to throw
sophisticated parties,

25:18.300 --> 25:22.500
which is why we are filling up
super soakers with vodka.

25:28.133 --> 25:29.734
- Hey!
- Hi!

25:29.767 --> 25:31.300
- Thanks for coming.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.700
- Hey!
- Hey!

25:33.734 --> 25:35.266
- Hey, what's up, guys?

25:35.300 --> 25:37.066
I got a house.
- That's a great dress.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.734
- What's up? It's muumuu. Hey.
- Hi, nice to see you.

25:38.767 --> 25:40.533
- Does everybody know
Logan and Dayna?

25:40.567 --> 25:41.633
- Dayna, Lala, pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.633
- Hi--oh.
- Hi, I'm Dayna.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.533
- Dayna.
- Go in for a hug, hi.

25:45.567 --> 25:46.633
Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.233
- Are you gonna do a shot?

25:48.266 --> 25:49.567
- (BLEEP) yeah, I don't
turn down shots, girl.

25:53.066 --> 25:54.700
- Dude, look at this.
Should I DJ later?

25:54.734 --> 25:56.700
- Ah, yeah, dude, for sure.

25:56.734 --> 25:58.233
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

25:58.266 --> 26:00.133
- Of course you can.
What's up, Peter?

26:00.166 --> 26:01.767
- Not much.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.166
Um, so, I know that, you know,
I'm your manager now,

26:05.200 --> 26:09.333
and I didn't want any
weirdness between us,

26:09.367 --> 26:12.100
because of, like,
what happened last year.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.700
- A couple weeks after
I moved to L.A.,

26:13.734 --> 26:15.600
my girlfriend brought me
to Skybar,

26:15.633 --> 26:19.633
and I met Tom Schwartz
and Tom Sandoval and Peter.

26:19.667 --> 26:21.767
Tom and Tom told me that
they were opening a bar,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.266
and I was actually looking
for a restaurant bar job.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.133
What happened last year?

26:27.166 --> 26:29.600
- I don't know, you and I
were in the bathroom together.

26:29.633 --> 26:32.166
Oh, no, no, I was sitting
right next to you.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.533
I was sitting right next
to you. That's why.

26:34.567 --> 26:36.200
- Yeah, I was peeing.

26:36.233 --> 26:38.266
- Really, and that's
not a big thing?

26:38.300 --> 26:40.000
- I mean, are you saying it's
something different than that?

26:40.033 --> 26:41.133
- We made out.
- No, we did not make out.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.066
- Yes, we did.
- No.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.633
You tried to kiss me, and
I leaned away, and I left.

26:44.667 --> 26:46.600
I have no idea

26:46.633 --> 26:48.667
why Peter's
saying we made out.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.166
I'm pretty sure I'd remember

26:50.200 --> 26:52.266
my first time making out
with a pirate.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.200
- I was just making sure
that it was not gonna be

26:54.233 --> 26:55.767
anything weird between us.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.667
- There's no weirdness
on my side.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.667
- Thank Jesus.
- Let's go do a shot.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.300
- All right, awesome, lead on.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.367
- Who else is, um--
who else is coming?

27:03.400 --> 27:06.300
- I miss Stass and Beau.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.133
- I forget how much traffic
is on the way to the airport.

27:09.166 --> 27:12.200
Did you write the vigil yet?
- I have to finish it.

27:12.233 --> 27:14.333
I'm so ----ing nervous.
I can't even begin to--

27:14.367 --> 27:16.200
- Well, don't, you're talking--

27:16.233 --> 27:18.000
you're in front of family
and friends, you know.

27:18.033 --> 27:19.700
Speak your feelings,
speak your heart.

27:19.734 --> 27:21.567
That's what a vigil is,
you know?

27:21.600 --> 27:23.166
You don't have to say
the right things, because--

27:23.200 --> 27:25.166
- Thought it's called a eulogy.
What's a vigil?

27:25.200 --> 27:28.567
- Oh. Maybe it is a eulogy.
I don't know.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.166
- Can I show you guys
the house?

27:30.200 --> 27:31.700
Who wants to come?
You wanna come?

27:31.734 --> 27:33.300
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah, let's go.

27:33.333 --> 27:35.200
- Okay, this is
my favorite bathroom.

27:35.233 --> 27:37.100
It's nothing special, but
it's a great pooping bathroom.

27:40.433 --> 27:43.233
- Hello? Hi.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.000
Hi.
- How are you?

27:45.033 --> 27:45.734
- Good, how are you?
- Good to see you.

27:45.767 --> 27:47.233
- You too.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.600
- Oh, no.
- No, I didn't, I didn't.

27:50.633 --> 27:52.066
- Brett, good to see
you again, man.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.734
- Maxie.
- How are you? Good.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.734
- It's fine, it's fine.

28:03.633 --> 28:06.100
- I know that Scheana and
Max dated in the past.

28:06.133 --> 28:08.233
Now I'm hearing that
they're going to Palm Springs

28:08.266 --> 28:10.166
for a couples vacation.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.300
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Love it.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.033
- Brett, this is
how we do it here.

28:16.066 --> 28:17.166
Oh, my God, I was kidding.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.066
- Whoa! Yeah!

28:19.100 --> 28:21.166
- Yeah, all right, Brett,
all right, all right.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.433
- I'm starting to
like him a lot.

28:24.467 --> 28:27.233
- Where's your significant
other? Is he coming?

28:27.266 --> 28:29.734
- I don't have one.
- You don't have one?

28:35.133 --> 28:37.066
- Speak of the Devil...
- What's up?

28:37.100 --> 28:40.066
- Hey! How's it going?
- All right, how are you?

28:50.700 --> 28:53.400
- Her and I weren't,
like, legit together.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.166
- I'm gonna be honest with
you, like, with Scheana,

28:59.200 --> 29:01.200
I mean, I think we all know
that she's very boy-crazy.

29:01.233 --> 29:02.734
- Yeah.

29:02.767 --> 29:04.333
- It can be a little
overwhelming at times,

29:04.367 --> 29:06.233
you know, when you do--
like, you just said,

29:06.266 --> 29:08.300
you got out of a pretty serious
relationship, as did I--

29:08.333 --> 29:11.033
like, the last thing you wanna
do is you run into something.

29:11.066 --> 29:13.266
I then made the mistake
of hanging out

29:13.300 --> 29:15.133
all the time every day.

29:15.166 --> 29:16.500
It wasn't like,
I didn't want to, though,

29:16.533 --> 29:18.467
you know what I mean?

29:18.500 --> 29:20.266
But then I realized, I'm like,
"(BLEEP), this is a lot."

29:20.300 --> 29:22.100
- Scheana...
- Wait, what are they saying?

29:22.133 --> 29:25.400
- That you're boy-crazy,
and that Max made the mistake

29:25.433 --> 29:27.333
of hanging out with you
all the time or...

29:27.367 --> 29:28.400
- Wait, what?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.200
- Maybe, like, let's say

29:30.233 --> 29:31.500
you guys were to connect
on that level, be like,

29:31.533 --> 29:33.400
"Hey, I wanna
hang out with you,

29:33.433 --> 29:35.033
"but I wanna--really wanna
take this a little slower

29:35.066 --> 29:37.166
than you have with
everybody else."

29:37.200 --> 29:39.133
- What are you guys
talking about?

29:39.166 --> 29:40.433
- Oh, nothing at all...

29:40.467 --> 29:42.100
- Mm, uh-huh.
- Just beautiful...

29:42.133 --> 29:45.133
- Really?
- You good?

29:45.166 --> 29:47.166
- Did you say I'm boy-crazy?

29:48.734 --> 29:50.533
- I--I--yeah.

29:50.567 --> 29:52.367
There's nothing wrong with that.
It's not a bad term.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.300
- It just sounded insulting.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.100
Katie was like, "I don't know,
Max is saying you're boy-crazy,

29:56.133 --> 29:57.300
"and, like, he made the mistake

29:57.333 --> 29:59.233
of hanging out
with you too much."

29:59.266 --> 30:01.100
- I mean, I--
- That was in confidence.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.367
- That's not how
it was said, but--

30:02.400 --> 30:04.133
- You were the one
who pursued me.

30:04.166 --> 30:06.033
Let's just not forget that.

30:06.066 --> 30:07.533
He doesn't know Brett
and I's relationship.

30:07.567 --> 30:09.033
He doesn't know
if I'm interested in him.

30:09.066 --> 30:11.000
So why would you say something

30:11.033 --> 30:12.767
that could make him run away?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.200
- Are you okay?
- Hey, I'm sorry.

30:14.233 --> 30:16.467
- It's just--
it's fine, it's fine.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.433
- He just said something
that hurt my feelings.

30:18.467 --> 30:20.467
- I'm sorry, all right?
I care about you.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.400
- Like, I feel like we've
gotten to such a good place,

30:22.433 --> 30:24.233
and we're, like, good friends.

30:24.266 --> 30:26.033
I'm like, "You're coming
to my house next weekend."

30:26.066 --> 30:27.467
- I know. I wasn't trying
to say it to offend you.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.300
- But it's just like,
all the sh-- with Adam

30:29.333 --> 30:31.166
and just everything,
it's just like, "Oh, she's--"

30:31.200 --> 30:33.100
it's just like, I don't like
being called crazy.

30:33.133 --> 30:34.200
I'm not crazy.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.000
And I'm over chasing boys.

30:36.033 --> 30:38.266
So, I'm not ----ing crazy.
I'm just--I'm...

30:38.300 --> 30:40.166
- You don't chase boys, because
you're an attractive woman.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.266
You don't need to chase anybody.
- I know I don't.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.200
- I love you.
- I love you too.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.500
- Come here.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.567
I don't mean to hurt
your feelings.

30:49.500 --> 30:53.000
- Brittany, you have
the tequila, girl?

30:53.033 --> 30:54.233
- Coming up...

30:54.266 --> 30:56.066
- It does seem like
you latched on.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.567
You know you've got
your bills paid.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.367
If you can't afford it
and take care of it,

30:59.400 --> 31:02.333
baby girl has a job, and--
- Okay.

31:02.367 --> 31:04.033
- Oh, I don't feel really
comfortable right now, though.

31:04.066 --> 31:05.567
Why is this happening?

31:12.333 --> 31:13.633
- Ready? Open!

31:15.667 --> 31:17.433
- Hey, let me see that thing.

31:17.467 --> 31:19.133
- No, dude, I don't trust Tom.
- Okay, get down.

31:19.166 --> 31:21.100
- Let me see that one.
- Ah!

31:21.133 --> 31:22.400
Oh, God.

31:22.433 --> 31:25.033
- That was amazing!

31:25.066 --> 31:27.500
- How did I just do that?
- Get him, girl.

31:27.533 --> 31:29.567
- You got some payback time.
Payback!

31:29.600 --> 31:32.033
- Did you talk to Carter?
- No.

31:32.066 --> 31:33.433
She's been asking him
to move out,

31:33.467 --> 31:35.300
and he, like, won't go.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.500
"This guy's manipulating you."

31:36.533 --> 31:39.000
- I'm gonna get the tea.

31:39.033 --> 31:40.600
- You would be a good
person to talk to.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.233
- Should I ask him
if he has a job?

31:42.266 --> 31:43.633
- No.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.400
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

31:45.433 --> 31:47.433
- Bottle of tequila.
Oh, my God.

31:47.467 --> 31:49.333
- Peter, you're a ----ing beast.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.233
- I wanna throw up
just watching you do that.

31:51.266 --> 31:53.133
- And we just ate
Imo's pizza in bed

31:53.166 --> 31:56.533
and watched TV
and that was it...

31:56.567 --> 31:58.633
- Can I talk to you real quick?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.200
- I'll allow it.

32:00.233 --> 32:01.667
Okay, be right back, you guys.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.300
- I just wanna, like, talk
about last night real quick.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.567
Like, you're going to Sur now.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.233
Like, it's not
gonna be a problem

32:13.266 --> 32:15.233
if we wanted to hang out
outside of work.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.266
Um, if you're not doing anything
tomorrow, before I go in,

32:17.300 --> 32:19.400
I would love to, like, go
do something and grab a bite.

32:19.433 --> 32:21.333
I used to have
a really strict policy

32:21.367 --> 32:23.033
about not hooking up
with staff,

32:23.066 --> 32:24.367
and I kinda broke
that rule with Dayna.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.233
That's why I stayed
away from her,

32:26.266 --> 32:27.667
because I could feel it
when I walked past her,

32:27.700 --> 32:29.066
the way she looked at me,
the way I talked to her,

32:29.100 --> 32:30.300
the way she talked to me.

32:30.333 --> 32:31.667
We just really just wanted

32:31.700 --> 32:34.300
to ----ing get after it
with each other.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.233
- Well, I'm just curious,

32:36.266 --> 32:40.066
are you going to Palm Springs
with Scheana in a week...

32:40.100 --> 32:41.533
- Not alone.
- For a honeymoon trip?

32:41.567 --> 32:43.533
- No, not alone, not that
I know of, but I am going.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.300
- What's the deal with that?

32:45.333 --> 32:46.567
- Scheana and I have not
hooked up since the time

32:46.600 --> 32:48.667
that we've stopped,
like, hooking up.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.233
I'm not gonna not be friends
with somebody, just because--

32:51.266 --> 32:53.467
- No, be--no, be friends all
you want, but I'm just like--

32:53.500 --> 32:55.333
I don't wanna be involved
in that messiness

32:55.367 --> 32:56.333
if that's still a thing.

32:56.367 --> 32:57.600
- 100%, no, not a thing.

32:57.633 --> 32:59.367
- I know there's red flags,

32:59.400 --> 33:01.133
I know there's people
giving me warnings,

33:01.166 --> 33:03.567
but, I don't know,
he makes me twitterpated.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.100
I mean, yeah,
let's hang out tomorrow,

33:06.133 --> 33:08.066
and see how that goes...
- Okay.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.700
- Let's just start there?
- Yeah.

33:11.500 --> 33:14.066
- Carter?
- What's up?

33:14.100 --> 33:15.533
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah, what's up, Mama?

33:15.567 --> 33:18.500
- Kristen is our friend...
- Yeah.

33:18.533 --> 33:20.433
- She cries often...
- Yeah.

33:20.467 --> 33:22.233
- Because you're still
living at the apartment.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.500
- Yeah, we're--yeah,
we're moving out.

33:23.533 --> 33:25.600
I'm moving out.

33:25.633 --> 33:27.500
I mean, that's gonna
take some time.

33:27.533 --> 33:29.633
- It does seem like
you've latched on,

33:29.667 --> 33:31.467
and it's a comfortable
situation,

33:31.500 --> 33:33.333
where you can go home at night.

33:33.367 --> 33:34.633
You know you've got
your bills paid.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.567
If you can't afford it
and take care of it,

33:36.600 --> 33:38.333
baby girl has a job, and--

33:38.367 --> 33:40.266
- Okay.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.133
- I know what it's like
to not be the financial equal

33:43.166 --> 33:44.367
of your partner,

33:44.400 --> 33:46.166
but I contribute in other ways.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.633
I'm running a household.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.633
I'm giving killer BJ's.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.433
What is Carter doing,

33:51.467 --> 33:53.667
besides sitting around
playing video games

33:53.700 --> 33:56.100
and sucking the life
out of my friend?

33:56.133 --> 33:58.367
- She did take care of me
for a while, yeah.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.333
- But she's doing it
right now, Carter,

34:00.367 --> 34:01.700
and you guys aren't "together."
- Taking care of me?

34:01.734 --> 34:04.200
- You know all.
You're Lala.

34:04.233 --> 34:05.667
- What's going on?

34:05.700 --> 34:07.533
- Lala's really handing it
to Carter out there.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.233
- Do you really think
that I would stay there

34:09.266 --> 34:10.600
if I didn't feel like

34:10.633 --> 34:12.367
she also wanted me there
at the same time?

34:12.400 --> 34:13.633
If she wants to cut
me out of her life,

34:13.667 --> 34:15.266
then she can come up
and tell me

34:15.300 --> 34:16.700
that she wants to cut me
out of her life.

34:16.734 --> 34:18.467
Guess who she calls
when she needs someone

34:18.500 --> 34:20.333
and she needs help?
Like, she calls me.

34:20.367 --> 34:22.433
I was doing video for her
to do on her website.

34:22.467 --> 34:24.233
Guess who shot her
photoshoot today?

34:24.266 --> 34:25.567
This guy, because she didn't
have anybody else.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.367
- Oh, my God,
this is ----ing crazy.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.600
From what Kristen has told me,

34:29.633 --> 34:31.400
she's told him that
he needs to move out

34:31.433 --> 34:33.166
and not come around as much.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.467
- Don't think she's innocent
in all this thing...

34:34.500 --> 34:36.367
- I don't think
anyone's ever innocent.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.133
- It's two-sided.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.266
- As I'm listening to Carter,

34:41.300 --> 34:45.166
I am officially seeing
the gray area.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.400
I just--I crave
honesty from people.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.433
- And I'm being honest.

34:49.467 --> 34:50.767
- But I don't know that she is.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.433
- Oh, I don't feel really
comfortable right now, though.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.400
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?

35:12.233 --> 35:14.300
- What's up, dude?
- Hey.

35:14.333 --> 35:15.734
- Where's your onesie, bro?

35:15.767 --> 35:17.500
- I didn't realize we were
supposed to wear onesies.

35:17.533 --> 35:20.266
How is your new house?
- It's great, man.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.567
If you wanna come over, just
maybe bring a chair with you.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.200
- Well, I would
like to come over

35:24.233 --> 35:26.467
if I would've ever
got an invitation.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.000
I saw Tom go in your house...

35:28.033 --> 35:29.533
- All right, I'm sorry
about that.

35:29.567 --> 35:31.233
- You know, and I was like,
"I'm not invited."

35:31.266 --> 35:32.700
- I didn't want
anybody over there.

35:32.734 --> 35:34.400
- It's not about that, dude.
I'm not gonna judge you.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.033
- You did judge me
a little bit, man.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.300
- No.

35:36.333 --> 35:37.767
- To me and Ariana, like,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.700
that's like our, like,
wedding day in a sense.

35:39.734 --> 35:41.400
And then when I'm, like, getting
ready to move into my house,

35:41.433 --> 35:42.667
you're like, "How much is it?"

35:42.700 --> 35:44.667
Like, "What's
the square footage?"

35:44.700 --> 35:46.500
I'm telling you about something
that I'm so excited about,

35:46.533 --> 35:48.500
and you kinda--you--
you told me about

35:48.533 --> 35:50.600
how you're gonna do,
like, better.

35:50.633 --> 35:52.400
And, you know,
"Me and Brittany,

35:52.433 --> 35:53.667
"we, like--we need to be
in the good schools."

35:53.700 --> 35:56.333
- Well, yeah,
'cause we want a family.

35:56.367 --> 35:58.533
In my head, I'm like,
"He's gonna get a shoebox.

35:58.567 --> 35:59.567
He's gonna get a shoebox."

35:59.600 --> 36:01.367
You are just two people.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.767
I plan on having a couple kids.
I need a big house.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.600
You have the fortune of
where it's just you two.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.367
I have a lot more people,
so, I'm gonna--

36:06.400 --> 36:08.333
yeah, I'm gonna have to
spend a lot more money,

36:08.367 --> 36:10.500
'cause, you know, Brittany's
gonna want two or three kids.

36:10.533 --> 36:13.000
- Jax, I've known you
for a really long time.

36:13.033 --> 36:15.367
It felt like a--like
just a one-upping,

36:15.400 --> 36:17.266
like, every step of the way.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.233
- By the way,
if there was any hostility,

36:19.266 --> 36:21.633
it's because I was feeling it--
I wasn't--I saw you, like, once.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.066
This is a serious time for me.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.500
Like, I'm getting married.

36:26.467 --> 36:29.633
- Listen, when you were planning
this pre-bachelor party,

36:29.667 --> 36:31.433
I told you right off the bat

36:31.467 --> 36:33.500
that it's just the one time
I can't do it.

36:33.533 --> 36:35.367
Then it's like,
I'm getting text messages

36:35.400 --> 36:38.033
about, like, second-guessing
me being your best man.

36:38.066 --> 36:39.600
- All I'm saying is,
man, once in a while,

36:39.633 --> 36:41.266
can you just say, "Hey, dude,

36:41.300 --> 36:42.400
"you know, I'm still
here for your wedding.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.266
"I can't wait for your big day.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.333
Just to let you know, I'm
excited about the wedding..."

36:45.367 --> 36:46.667
- I did text you that.

36:46.700 --> 36:47.767
- "Let you know that
I'm thinking about you."

36:48.000 --> 36:49.467
- I did text you that.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.433
- I didn't have any of
those texts, I don't.

36:50.467 --> 36:52.066
- Jax, look, look...

36:52.100 --> 36:54.300
"Yo, after this week,
let's get together.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.533
Let me know what
I can help out with."

36:56.567 --> 36:58.533
I sent that to you.

36:58.567 --> 37:00.066
- I didn't--I didn't
remember seeing it.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.633
I--obviously I did,
'cause I responded--

37:01.667 --> 37:03.066
- And then you responded back.
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:06.533 --> 37:08.066
Okay.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.734
- With Jax's wedding
this summer,

37:09.767 --> 37:14.000
he's kind of enjoying this,
like, power that he has.

37:14.033 --> 37:16.400
I feel like he's definitely
taken advantage of it.

37:16.433 --> 37:17.600
- Obviously I want you
to be my best man.

37:17.633 --> 37:19.066
That wasn't my intention.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.333
My intention was
to get your attention,

37:20.367 --> 37:22.000
and I think I did.

37:22.033 --> 37:24.066
Tom Sandoval has pissed me off
the last couple weeks.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.767
I know I'm right,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.400
but I just know it'll be weird
if he's not there.

37:27.433 --> 37:29.433
- I would be honored
to be your best man.

37:29.467 --> 37:31.567
- And I would love for you
to be my best man, of course.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.734
I love you, man.
- Sorry, dude.

37:32.767 --> 37:34.533
I love you too, man.

37:34.567 --> 37:36.567
- Coming up...

37:36.600 --> 37:38.100
- I'm tired of you talking about
what an amazing friend you are

37:38.133 --> 37:39.500
and everyone's a sh---y friend.

37:39.533 --> 37:41.066
Get over yourself.

37:41.100 --> 37:42.400
- Is that my wife?
- That's your wife.

37:42.433 --> 37:43.467
- Oh, (BLEEP).

37:56.500 --> 37:57.667
- Double-dipping?

37:57.700 --> 37:59.400
- So, you and Lala were talking

37:59.433 --> 38:01.033
for, like, a really
----ing long time,

38:01.066 --> 38:02.467
and it was, like, freaking me
the (BLEEP) out.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.367
- I mean, she basically
came up to me

38:04.400 --> 38:06.000
and told me that
I need to move out,

38:06.033 --> 38:07.667
because you're unhappy
and you're sad and, like...

38:07.700 --> 38:09.533
- That's what she said?

38:09.567 --> 38:11.433
This is when I get ----ing
defensive, and then...

38:11.467 --> 38:13.633
- I was very, like, kind of...
- Tell me.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.367
- Taken off guard by it.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.000
- It's just none of
anyone's business

38:17.033 --> 38:18.600
to ever tell you to move out
or to do whatever.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.667
- Look, you don't--
you don't have to protect me.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.500
- But I'm going to.

38:27.700 --> 38:31.500
- Carter has some kinda
strange power over Kristen.

38:31.533 --> 38:33.500
He can treat her like sh--,

38:33.533 --> 38:34.734
and then when she tells him
she wants to break up,

38:34.767 --> 38:36.600
he's still gonna
live in her house

38:36.633 --> 38:39.433
and sleep in her bed
and eat all of her food,

38:39.467 --> 38:40.433
and that's ----ed up.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.600
- I love you.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.233
- What's going on?
You okay?

38:54.266 --> 38:56.633
- I would expect
this type of behavior

38:56.667 --> 38:58.400
from maybe, like,
Katie or Stassi,

38:58.433 --> 39:00.467
but not from Lala.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.567
I would never go to Randall,

39:02.600 --> 39:05.133
knowing that they were
in a fight, and interject.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.233
I've learned my lesson
with Tom and Katie.

39:07.266 --> 39:09.000
- Talk to her about it.
- Lala, I wanna talk to you.

39:09.033 --> 39:11.133
I feel ----ing weird right now.
- What?

39:11.166 --> 39:12.533
- I just wanna know
what the (BLEEP)--

39:12.567 --> 39:14.500
'cause I could see
you and Carter

39:14.533 --> 39:16.500
talking through the window, and
it made me so nervous, and...

39:18.166 --> 39:20.133
- Honestly, I really wanna
know the same thing,

39:20.166 --> 39:22.200
because you can't tell us

39:22.233 --> 39:24.500
that you're, like, really
miserable and crying,

39:24.533 --> 39:26.500
and then call Carter.

39:26.533 --> 39:30.600
I don't like when people are
confiding in me about something

39:30.633 --> 39:33.667
that couldn't be further
from what's really going on.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.133
- Things are messy, and I--

39:35.166 --> 39:37.033
- They've been messy
for a long time.

39:37.066 --> 39:38.266
- I'm sorry for you guys

39:38.300 --> 39:40.066
that it doesn't work
for you guys.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.033
- Is it working for you?

39:42.066 --> 39:43.600
- I'm doing the best
that I can to be hap--

39:43.633 --> 39:46.066
- Okay, Kristen, then,
that's what it is.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.600
- God.

39:47.633 --> 39:49.000
- I'm not gonna, like,
try to, like, help--

39:49.033 --> 39:50.667
like, someone that's
struggling--

39:50.700 --> 39:52.433
- You haven't tried to help me.
I haven't talked to you.

39:52.467 --> 39:54.066
- Do me a favor and
don't call me at all,

39:54.100 --> 39:56.033
'cause you did bring it
to my front door,

39:56.066 --> 39:57.033
and now you're doing to me what
you did to Katie and Stassi,

39:57.066 --> 39:58.567
and I'm not into it.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.433
- Not doing it.
I'm not doing this bullsh--.

40:00.467 --> 40:01.767
- What do you mean?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.433
- You just pulled
a Katie and Stassi card?

40:03.467 --> 40:04.700
That is--that's how I know
you're not you.

40:04.734 --> 40:06.200
- Because you're
getting mad at me.

40:06.233 --> 40:07.233
Because you're
getting mad at me.

40:07.266 --> 40:08.734
- What is going on?

40:08.767 --> 40:10.033
- You just got--
- I still believe that.

40:10.066 --> 40:11.233
- You just got up and said,

40:11.266 --> 40:12.667
"Don't talk to me
about anything,"

40:12.700 --> 40:13.667
and walked away
like a ----ing bitch.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.500
Like, it wasn't cool.

40:15.533 --> 40:17.100
- Do not call--do not--
- No, well, you are.

40:17.133 --> 40:18.600
- No, no, no, do not
call me out on my name.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.066
Do not call me out
on my name, Kristen.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.600
- Sh--'s going crazy
in there, guys.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.200
- What the (BLEEP) is
going on in there, dude?

40:23.233 --> 40:24.734
- I don't know, man.
- You are my friend.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.266
Do not ----ing call
me out on my name.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.767
- Calm down.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.533
Calm down, both of y'all.

40:29.567 --> 40:31.000
- You are my friend.
Do not call me a bitch.

40:31.033 --> 40:32.233
- Calm down, both of you.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.066
- I will not be spoken down to

40:34.100 --> 40:35.734
by this sugar mama,

40:35.767 --> 40:37.200
who I'm just trying to save

40:37.233 --> 40:40.100
from her disaster
of a relationship.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.767
- Kristen, you don't
get to walk away.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.166
No one is attacking you.
No one is getting in your face.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.533
Everyone's trying
to be real with you,

40:46.567 --> 40:48.100
and you're standing--

40:48.133 --> 40:50.600
- All right, go sit down
and talk together!

40:50.633 --> 40:52.533
Come on, let's figure this out.

40:52.567 --> 40:55.000
You guys are friends.
We don't have to end like this.

40:55.033 --> 40:58.066
- Stop acting like no one's
been there for you, please.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.033
It's so tired and old.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.600
I'm gonna scream this in
your ear, so you get it,

41:02.633 --> 41:04.633
because I'm tired of
you talking about

41:04.667 --> 41:07.100
what an amazing friend you are
and everyone's a sh---y friend.

41:07.133 --> 41:09.767
That sh-- is bullsh--.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Get over yourself.

41:13.567 --> 41:15.066
- Is that my wife?
- That's your wife.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.166
- Oh, (BLEEP).
Is she mad?

41:16.200 --> 41:18.166
I'm out of here.
- Dude...

41:18.200 --> 41:19.600
- Hey, you guys need to talk.
- Are you sh---ing me right now?

41:19.633 --> 41:21.100
- Kristen...

41:21.133 --> 41:23.000
- How many times
can someone cry wolf?

41:23.033 --> 41:24.667
How many times does someone
come cry on my balcony

41:24.700 --> 41:27.100
for seven hours,
telling me how sad they are?

41:27.133 --> 41:29.767
So, forgive me for
wanting better for you.

41:34.266 --> 41:36.333
- This season on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

41:36.367 --> 41:39.600
- Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

41:39.633 --> 41:42.166
- To party.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.333
- This is awesome!

41:48.367 --> 41:50.133
- You make me so happy.

41:50.166 --> 41:51.700
- I haven't done this
since my honeymoon.

41:51.734 --> 41:53.066
- If you don't get that joke,
you're poor.

41:53.100 --> 41:55.266
- I'm getting married!

41:55.300 --> 41:57.767
- I say keep your shirt on,
take your trousers off.

42:01.333 --> 42:03.233
- Is there a little bit
of jealousy there?

42:03.266 --> 42:05.000
- Oh, my God, Lisa,
I'm not jealous of Dayna.

42:05.033 --> 42:07.000
- Are you 34 or are you 16?

42:07.033 --> 42:08.533
- You're a great guy...
- Goodnight.

42:08.567 --> 42:10.367
- But your dating life
is a bit of a mess.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.000
- You just, like,
(BLEEP) a bunch of people

42:12.033 --> 42:13.600
to validate yourself.

42:13.633 --> 42:14.667
- Let's not forget
I ----ing hired you here.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.133
- Walk down the hall.

42:16.166 --> 42:17.734
We're getting married?
- Yeah.

42:17.767 --> 42:19.667
