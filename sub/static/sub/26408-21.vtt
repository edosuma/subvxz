00:01.430 --> 00:04.160
Previously onSEAL Team...Hey, Swanny.

00:04.220 --> 00:06.029
DR. WILSON: Traumatic
brain injuries go unreported.

00:06.090 --> 00:08.251
You want to make a difference?
Make that your missmn now.

00:08.310 --> 00:10.005
RAY: There you go again,
calling out everybody else's

00:10.050 --> 00:11.529
imperfections
when your hypocritical ass

00:11.570 --> 00:12.741
is too stubborn to understand

00:12.790 --> 00:14.394
that you've been
falling apart at the seams.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.442
You trying to hit me, huh?

00:16.490 --> 00:19.539
ERIC: Yasin Khan is shaping up to be the next Osama bin Laden.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.798
We tracked his camp
to the Kashmir mountains.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.660
Nothing can go wrong
on this one.

00:23.710 --> 00:24.847
RAY:
Too low, I got to cut away.

00:24.890 --> 00:25.879
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1.

00:25.930 --> 00:27.067
We've lost Ray.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.282
JASON:
Bravo 2, this is 1.

00:37.340 --> 00:39.296
[panﬁng]

00:39.340 --> 00:41.808
Bravo 2, this is 1. [panting]

00:41.860 --> 00:44.511
Bravo 2, this is 1.

00:44.560 --> 00:48.473
Bravo 2...Jace, any word on Ray?

00:48.520 --> 00:51.080
Hey, Jace,
did his reserve open?

00:51.130 --> 00:53.690
TRENT: I saw him
under reserve canopy.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.049
_ But he was real low
when It opened.I tell you right there,

00:56.090 --> 00:57.261
we should have never
done this missmn.

00:57.310 --> 00:58.436
Our minds weren't in it.Listen to me, Sonny.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.048
Pull it together, got it?

01:00.100 --> 01:02.534
Ray worked the problem,
he's gonna be fine.

01:02.580 --> 01:04.923
Okay, but we don't know that.

01:05.970 --> 01:07.449
Havoc, this is 1.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.183
I pass flea-flicker.
Were you able

01:09.240 --> 01:10.753
to establish comms with Bravo 2?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.109
Yeah, copy that, 1,
passing flea-flicker.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.412
Bravo 2 deployed his reserve
and was tracking

01:15.460 --> 01:17.542
to put down
about ten klicks from the L2.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.070
Still trying to
raise him on comms.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.634
[panting] Ten klicks,

01:22.690 --> 01:24.248
that puts him on the
east side of the mountain.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.074
Area's crawling
with enemy.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.076
Yeah, smack-dab in the middle
of terrorist Walley World.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.257
No QRF, no ISR
for overwatch.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.087
I'm telling you right now,
Ray's in a lot of trouble.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.564
Havoc, this is 1.

01:35.610 --> 01:37.828
I'm gonna retrieve Bravo 2
and then head to target.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.520
Negative, 1. Bravo 2 is aware
of his contingency procedures,

01:41.570 --> 01:43.652
and he's likely moving
to the tertiary exfil point.

01:43.710 --> 01:45.189
You are to_ continue
your mrssnon.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.743
That's a big assumption;
we don't know his status.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.665
ERIC:
Bravo 2 is trained

01:48.710 --> 01:50.883
for this type of situation.

01:50.930 --> 01:53.535
Be advised that your mission
is time-sensitive.

01:53.590 --> 01:55.364
Your orders are to Charlie Mike.

01:55.410 --> 01:56.581
JASON:
Copy that. We're out.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.029
Are you kidding me, Jace?

01:58.070 --> 02:00.026
We're gonna leave Ray out
in the cold?

02:00.070 --> 02:02.595
TRENT:
We're the only American boots on
the ground that can go get him.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.982
BROCK: Come on, boss,
we can't leave him behind.

02:04.030 --> 02:06.112
Stop. Enough.
All right? Enough.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.502
Get your heads in the game.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.243
We got an op to do.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.949
Ray is gonna meet us
at the exfil point.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.729
He is gonna be fine.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.476
Hide the gear
and let's go.

02:19.790 --> 02:22.520
Let's go.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.187
Bravo 2, this is 1.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.869
Bravo 2, key your mic.

02:29.930 --> 02:32.626
Come on, Ray.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.461
[Ray panting]

02:54.520 --> 02:56.385
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.

02:56.430 --> 02:59.160
Copy?

02:59.220 --> 03:00.642
Damn it.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.305
[grunts] Okay.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.908
This is Bravo 2 to Havoc Base.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.224
Do you copy?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.919
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.574
Do you copy?

03:12.060 --> 03:14.620
[panting] Damn it.

03:16.580 --> 03:17.922
[panﬁng]

03:20.720 --> 03:21.880
Damn it. [exhales]

03:21.940 --> 03:24.238
Oh.

03:24.290 --> 03:26.758
[men speaking foreign language
nearby]

03:50.830 --> 03:52.832
[speaking foreign language]

03:55.100 --> 03:56.965
Don't look up.
Don't look up.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.847
Don't look up.

04:18.470 --> 04:22.338
We're gonna put down at an
Indian base in Udhampur.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.813
They're not gonna be happy about
running ops behind their backs.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.997
Sitrep on Senior Chief Perry?

04:27.040 --> 04:29.600
He put down somewhere
near Kotli.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.914
An area that harbors
13 launch pads

04:32.960 --> 04:34.268
and a_d_ozen terrorist
training camps.

04:34.310 --> 04:35.356
How many militants
we talking about?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.789
Couple thousand fighters

04:37.840 --> 04:40.001
within two miles
of Senior Chief Perry.

04:45.190 --> 04:48.102
An American special operator
killed or captured

04:48.150 --> 04:49.629
inside Pakistani territory

04:49.680 --> 04:53.059
_would unleash
a diplomatic firestorm

04:53.110 --> 04:57.376
that will bury this command,
not to mention Bravo team.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.502
Ray's canopy chute
malfunctioned.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.428
It was more bad luck_
than poor execution... snr.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.994
Seems like bad luck's
been lingering

05:05.040 --> 05:06.905
around Bravo for months.

05:06.950 --> 05:08.508
I need to update
the Pentagon.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.691
[muttering quietly]

05:21.400 --> 05:23.356
All right.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.355
[men speaking foreign language
nearby]

05:25.410 --> 05:26.536
RAY:_
Damn It.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.512
SONNY:
Hey, J.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.209
Save your owgen, Sonny.

05:52.260 --> 05:54.603
Look, Ray's alone
in the wilderness.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.379
You're a sheepdog.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.044
Sheepdog's gotta keep
this flock together.

05:58.090 --> 05:59.478
Yeah, right. Sheepdog's also
gotta drive the herd

05:59.530 --> 06:01.043
so they don't lose their way.

06:01.090 --> 06:03.786
You know, when I was
in that torpedo tube,

06:03.840 --> 06:05.796
the only thing that kept
me going was knowing

06:05.840 --> 06:08.661
that my brothers were a few
feet away from me, all right?

06:08.710 --> 06:11.406
This world is a hell of
a lot eaSIer to navrgate

06:11.450 --> 06:13.236
when you got someone
to lean on.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.793
Ray's gonna be just fine.

06:14.850 --> 06:18.320
This fight's
making you see red.

06:18.370 --> 06:21.248
The last time Ray
was on his own,

06:21.290 --> 06:23.895
it_ wasn't a mountain
keeping him from the team.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.851
It was you.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.368
He was the first damn person
to show up when Alana died.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.330
Hey, listen to me.
I'm very aware

06:30.390 --> 06:31.994
what Ray has done for me.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.814
You don't think I have any
interest in finding him?

06:33.870 --> 06:35.474
You don't think I want
to make things right?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.340
It's Bravo 2,
he's my best friend.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.039
But right now,
we have a job to do.

06:39.090 --> 06:40.910
Get your head
out of your ass.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.133
Emotions get people killed.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.764
JASON:
Bravo 2, come in.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.546
Come on, Ray.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.204
Where are you?

07:18.130 --> 07:19.734
MANDY:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.828
Picking up SIGINT that militants

07:21.870 --> 07:24.521
located a parachute
and two killed fighters.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.913
They know they have a visitor.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.838
[panting] Havoc, this is 1.

07:29.880 --> 07:34.055
If Bravo 2 is discovered,
our HVT's gonna disappear.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.751
Recovering 2 is critical
for mission success.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.884
Request permission to break off
to go get Bravo 2.

07:40.930 --> 07:43.194
ERIC:
Bravo 2 has kicked up
a hornet's nest.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.105
It sounds like the enemy
is already swarming.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.639
You head over that mountain,

07:46.680 --> 07:48.454
there's no cavalry coming
to your rescue.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.762
Do you understand
what you're requesting?

07:50.810 --> 07:52.027
Copy that.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.331
We're aware of the risks.

07:53.380 --> 07:54.768
Bravo 2 needs us.

07:58.340 --> 08:01.901
All right.
Let's retrieve Bravo 2.

08:01.950 --> 08:04.430
Copy that. Bravo out.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.084
All right,
change of plans.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.779
We're going to get Ray.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.796
Tertiary exfil point's
on the other side

08:16.840 --> 08:18.182
of that mountain summit.

08:18.230 --> 08:21.222
Enemy's fortified
in there like Tora Bora.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.623
Could avoid contact by
going around the mountain
instead of over.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.149
Ray doesn't have time.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.622
Speed is safety
on this one.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.238
Trent, lead us east.You got it.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.208
You scrubbed the op?

08:40.250 --> 08:41.854
No, sir. I am
trying to save it.

08:41.910 --> 08:44.378
I gave Bravo a frag-o.

08:44.430 --> 08:46.648
Tactically, it is
our only option.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.305
If the enemy finds Ray,
Khan will know we are here

08:49.350 --> 08:51.568
and he will go underground.

08:51.610 --> 08:53.305
Bravo needs to get
to Ray first.

08:53.350 --> 08:57.480
All the strings pulled just
to authorize this operation,

08:57.530 --> 08:59.578
and your team can't even
execute it.

08:59.620 --> 09:02.271
It's the right call.Right or wrong,

09:02.320 --> 09:04.709
it's your call,
Lieutenant Commander Blackburn,

09:04.760 --> 09:07.274
one that better succeed.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.371
[panﬁng]

09:20.210 --> 09:21.814
Damn it.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.257
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2,
do you copy?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.608
[radio static]

09:30.260 --> 09:32.694
Any station this ne...

09:48.280 --> 09:51.408
[knocking on door]

09:51.460 --> 09:53.803
Yeah. Yeah, give me a minute.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.325
Hi.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.632
Hey.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.819
Come on in.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.813
You look good.

10:12.430 --> 10:14.773
I mean,
all things considered.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.309
How did you hear?

10:16.350 --> 10:18.659
Uh... [chuckles] Naima.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.520
And-and I just--

10:20.570 --> 10:23.357
I just had to come
and see for myself.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.389
[Clay scoffs]

10:24.440 --> 10:25.964
You, not your leg.

10:26.010 --> 10:28.797
Wasn't really a big deal.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.149
You don't have
to do that for me.

10:31.190 --> 10:34.011
I can handle what happened,
a bomb nearly killed you.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.231
Yeah, but it didn't.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.498
Thank God.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.804
I, um...

10:39.850 --> 10:42.808
I came to the hospital.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.852
Like, six weeks ago.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.595
I'm sorry.
I must have been--

10:46.640 --> 10:48.983
I must have been really drugged
up, I don't remember that.

10:49.030 --> 10:50.907
Mm. I never actually made it
out of the lobby.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.386
Well, bombing validated
all your concerns

10:54.430 --> 10:57.649
of why we couldn't be together.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.305
STELLA:
M-My...

11:00.350 --> 11:01.954
heart told me that
I needed to come

11:02.000 --> 11:04.468
and nurse you
back to health,

11:04.530 --> 11:08.227
but then I realized that, uh,
that wasn't my place anymore

11:08.270 --> 11:11.262
and that you were probably
in enough pain without me.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.312
Honestly, I wasn't a lot of fun
to be around then anyways.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.100
Yeah, but were you ever fun?

11:16.150 --> 11:18.789
[scoffs, mutters quietly]

11:20.330 --> 11:22.491
So, what, are you--
you're moving?

11:22.550 --> 11:25.804
No, I had a, I had a friend
that was staying with me.

11:25.850 --> 11:29.547
Oh, and, uh,
did your friend leave?

11:31.340 --> 11:33.296
It's a long story.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.854
I didn't drive
all this way to just

11:35.910 --> 11:38.378
hang out for five minutes.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.004
MANDY:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

11:49.050 --> 11:50.836
Be advised, Indian assets

11:50.880 --> 11:54.577
report enemy massing between
Bravo 2's last known location

11:54.620 --> 11:57.407
and the tertiary exfil point.Copy that.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.838
They know who they're after?

11:58.890 --> 12:01.108
Negative. There's no chatter
about American military.

12:01.150 --> 12:02.879
Copy that. Bravo out.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.750
All right, set
security, hydrate.

12:04.810 --> 12:06.801
They're moving, too.

12:17.510 --> 12:19.774
Whole other side of the
mountain's after Ray,

12:19.820 --> 12:23.608
chasing him down.
He's not making it to exfil.

12:23.650 --> 12:26.824
Uh, he's just evading now,
pushing deeper into the valley.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.918
Yeah, the enemy's dictating his
choices. I'm telling you what,

12:28.960 --> 12:32.088
if I'm Ray, I'm using this river
as a guide to get to the border.

12:32.140 --> 12:34.608
Our hike has officially
turned into an odyssey.

12:34.660 --> 12:35.831
Sure has.
I want you to hydrate,

12:35.880 --> 12:37.359
okay? We're moving in two.Yeah. Hey, J.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.571
Yeah?

12:38.620 --> 12:41.441
I didn't mean to cross
the line earlier.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.538
Sure you did.
You were worried about Ray.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.536
We all are.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.013
I crossed the line with Ray,

12:48.070 --> 12:50.197
as a team leader
and as a friend.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.549
You both were in the wrong.

12:52.590 --> 12:54.023
Well, Mexico
messed him up.
Mm-hmm.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.288
I saw it. He'd been
struggling for a while.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.149
I should've picked him up,
I knocked him down.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.552
That was wrong of me.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.296
I kept waiting for him
to sort it out on his own.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.070
Maybe you're right.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.598
Maybe we can't do
all this on our own.Hey, Jace.

13:07.650 --> 13:10.039
We are gonna go
find Ray right now.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.910
You understand?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.916
[panﬁng]
Right.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.612
Okay. You think old Shaw's
gonna carve up Bravo for this?

13:17.660 --> 13:19.139
I don't care about Shaw.

13:19.180 --> 13:21.398
Without Ray,
there is no Bravo team.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.350
Roger that.All right, let's go.

13:23.410 --> 13:25.571
We got to move.
Come on.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.626
[panﬁng]

13:35.770 --> 13:37.715
Ah, damn it.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.725
[men shouting
in foreign language]

13:42.770 --> 13:45.512
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2,
in the blind.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.164
I pass fumble.

13:47.210 --> 13:49.258
Route to tertiary exfil point
has been compromised.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.380
Do you copy?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.738
[radio static]

13:51.780 --> 13:53.475
Havoc Base?

13:55.530 --> 13:56.861
[panﬁng]

13:56.920 --> 13:58.308
Damn it.

13:58.350 --> 14:00.398
Havoc Base, strobe on.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.044

14:06.670 --> 14:08.274

14:08.320 --> 14:09.878
Damn it. Damn it.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.318
[gunfire continues]

14:22.990 --> 14:24.981
SONNY:
Last time I was

14:25.030 --> 14:28.909
this dehydrated, it was that
training mission in Mississippi.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.464
Yeah. You downed
so much mescal,

14:31.520 --> 14:33.772
Ray had to drag you
home early every night.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.084
[laughing]:
Yeah. Yeah, I never got
to thank him for that.

14:36.130 --> 14:38.121
Never thanked him
for a lot of things.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.434
[gunfire]JASON:
Contact front! Contact front!

14:41.480 --> 14:44.131
Move! Go!

14:44.180 --> 14:45.522
TRENT:
Contact right!
Contact right!

14:45.580 --> 14:46.968
JASON:
Push right! Push right!

14:47.010 --> 14:49.183
Take cover![gunfire continues]

[bullets ricocheting]

14:54.930 --> 14:57.535
[gunfire continues]

15:07.550 --> 15:11.372
We got two enemy dead,
sitting down in both directions!

15:11.430 --> 15:12.465
RPGs.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.384
We're gonna get chewed up here!

15:13.430 --> 15:14.590
We got to move!

15:14.650 --> 15:17.869
Metal, Sonny, push left,
hammer that bunker!

15:17.910 --> 15:20.959
Hoo-ya,
Master Chief!Brock, smoke.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.524
Smoke out.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.219
Go! Go! Go!Go! Go!

15:24.270 --> 15:25.999
[gunfire continues]

15:35.490 --> 15:37.230
Cover me!

15:41.280 --> 15:43.498
We got to get
to that second bunker!

15:44.940 --> 15:46.976
[grunting]

15:47.030 --> 15:48.679
JASON:
Smoke!

15:48.730 --> 15:51.028
Full Metal, hit 'em!
We got to push right!

15:51.080 --> 15:53.548
Push right!Go.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.773

15:58.130 --> 16:00.166
[gunfire continues]

16:05.350 --> 16:07.659
You got it?Found the other bunker.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.520
All right, this one's mine.
Come on.

16:09.570 --> 16:10.741
I got this one.

16:13.710 --> 16:15.575
[gunfire continues]

16:23.930 --> 16:25.534
Nice shot, boss.

16:25.590 --> 16:27.012
Yeah. Here.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.540
Let's go. Consolidate on me.

16:32.680 --> 16:35.023
If this thing goes south,
we don't get Khan...

16:35.080 --> 16:37.685
All the work you put in,
it should be your collar.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.904
Khan can wait.
There's only one Ray.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.508
Is this your
contact from the DIA?

16:42.560 --> 16:44.209
Doesn't look like
she's putting out

16:44.260 --> 16:45.864
the welcome mat for us.

16:45.910 --> 16:47.639
Where do you get off
running an operation

16:47.700 --> 16:49.827
in our baclqard
without informing us?

16:49.870 --> 16:52.828
Need I remind you Kashmir
is the likeliest flash point

16:52.880 --> 16:54.484
for nuclear war
In the world?

16:54.530 --> 16:56.134
Thank you for coming, Anita.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.705
We never intended the op
to play out this way.

16:58.750 --> 17:02.402
Reports state the entire valley
of militants is mobilizing.

17:02.450 --> 17:03.929
Why?

17:03.970 --> 17:05.528
Infil went haywire,

17:05.580 --> 17:08.140
and got a man trapped
in the Azad region.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.361
Five operators
are racing after him,

17:10.420 --> 17:13.674
but I don't have any assets
that can assist in the search.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.338
My government can't escalate the
situation by getting involved.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.723
Unless the enemy
is mobilizing an incursion

17:19.770 --> 17:21.203
into Indian territory.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.253
Might seem prudent

17:24.300 --> 17:27.519
for you to launch ISR
to monitor their movements?

17:27.560 --> 17:31.041
And perhaps we catch a
glimpse of our missing soldier?

17:31.090 --> 17:32.648
Perhaps.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.045
I have to make a call.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.585
I don't understand how Brett
doesn't deserve a Purple Heart.

17:50.630 --> 17:53.098
I mean, he was
injured in combat.

17:53.150 --> 17:56.233
Yeah. Military doesn't
see it that way.

17:56.290 --> 17:59.509
They even, uh... they even
threatened my career

17:59.550 --> 18:01.108
ifI keep pushing Brett's story.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.684
Unbelievable.

18:02.730 --> 18:04.379
You guys sacrifice so much
only to be abandoned

18:04.430 --> 18:05.852
when you're no longer of use.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.645
I didn't mean you.

18:08.690 --> 18:11.818
It's all right. I feel
pretty useless these days.

18:11.870 --> 18:13.997
Especially for Swanny.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.952
He was very lucky
to have you in his life.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.048
Believe me.

18:20.220 --> 18:21.824
You know,
maybe it's...

18:21.880 --> 18:23.529
Maybe it's better
that warriors like us

18:23.580 --> 18:25.389
die heroes on the battlefield,

18:25.450 --> 18:28.271
rather than come home and wilt
away as forgotten statistics.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.663
Is that how you feel?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.712
Brett felt that way.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.847
Sorry. I know this isn't
your favorite topic.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.368
I can handle it. Please.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.059
I thought we broke up
because you couldn't.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.111
That's fair.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.299
Part of me still thinks
that I'd be

18:49.340 --> 18:51.251
a lot happier if I'd just
kept my shut my mouth

18:51.300 --> 18:54.349
and let you get on that plane
to Mexico.Wel|, you know what?

18:54.390 --> 18:55.903
It's-it's better it
happened there on the tarmac

18:55.960 --> 18:57.302
than ten years
down the road, right?

18:59.220 --> 19:01.211
Yeah, maybe.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.397
I just wonder
ifI performed emergency surgery

19:03.440 --> 19:05.829
on a wound
that didn't actually exist.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.271
Uh, I'm assuming
that you reached out to Ash

19:12.320 --> 19:14.538
to help push, uh, Brett's story?

19:14.580 --> 19:17.629
No. Uh, look, my dad's
let me down my whole life.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.412
Swanny deserves
better than that.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.190
Your dad has a platform
on cable news.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.117
And as a former SEAL,
he can help

19:25.160 --> 19:26.718
keep you out
of Harrington's crosshairs,

19:26.770 --> 19:29.375
I mean, let you get back
to the, to the pipe kicking.

19:29.420 --> 19:33.208
It's door kicking,
or pipe hitting.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.993
Whatever. My alpha-male jargon's
a bit rusty. Sorry.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.990
You really want me
back operating, huh?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.480
This your way of telling me
you're seeing somebody?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.186
Is this your way of asking?

19:55.450 --> 19:57.623
Stop deflecting on Ash.

19:57.670 --> 20:00.230
I'm not sure
he'd be willing to help.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.454
There's only one way
to find out.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.061
[sighs]

20:10.990 --> 20:12.981
Havoc, this is 1.
Any word on 2?

20:13.030 --> 20:14.679
ERIC:
Yeah, negative, 1.

20:14.730 --> 20:16.982
But our host country is
spinning up its ISR.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.645
Copy that. Bravo 1 out.

20:19.690 --> 20:21.646
Finally get some eyes
over Ray.

20:21.690 --> 20:23.999
First good news
since we jumped in.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.598
SONNY:
I'm telling you, man.

20:25.650 --> 20:28.608
I knew this op had bad juju

20:28.660 --> 20:31.265
once old fat-head Shaw
got on that plane.

20:31.310 --> 20:34.313
Tell you what, man.
The cake-eaters are like...

20:34.360 --> 20:36.487
What?

20:36.530 --> 20:38.532
Felt something depress
under my right foot.

20:38.580 --> 20:41.492
Pretty sure it's a land mine.

20:44.370 --> 20:47.066
JASON:

20:47.110 --> 20:49.670

Land mines are like
the sharks of the dirt.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.561
Don't have time for this.
I'll figure it out.

21:56.610 --> 21:58.168
You guys keep going.JASON:
Not gonna happen, Trent.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.186
Go. I'll make it safe myself.

22:02.230 --> 22:04.186
SONNY:
The hell you will, Trent.

22:04.230 --> 22:06.016
I've seen you open
a beer bottle before.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.312
Now, letting you do surgery
on a bomb,

22:08.370 --> 22:09.849
that's probably gonna
turn us into wolf food.

22:09.890 --> 22:12.279
Don't make me laugh, Sonny.
I'm literally on a mine.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.890
Small pressure plate.

22:14.940 --> 22:17.454
Okay? You step off,
and you go boom.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.159
Guess I won't be
stepping off, then.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.679
Think I have an idea.
Give me your hook knife.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.987
Brock, punch that in.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.031
Right there. Easy.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.781
Give me your knife.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.798

22:57.330 --> 22:59.366

You want me open up
on this technical?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.739
JASON:
No. Any of those bullets
hit this minefield,

23:17.780 --> 23:19.429
we're gonna be
chum. Stay down.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.731

on that one.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.315
We lost a lot of time.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.352
We got to go back
the way we came.

24:16.410 --> 24:19.368
Easy up and out. Come on.

26:39.070 --> 26:42.198
Two hours, give or take.

for Ray to hold out.

You all right, Jace?Ah.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.518
Been riding you guys so hard.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.811
Led you right into a minefield.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.167
You got some superpowers,

26:52.210 --> 26:54.212
but X-ray vision
ain't one of them.

26:54.260 --> 26:56.160
Not your fault.

26:56.220 --> 26:58.916
Hey, sir. Take a look
at your monitor.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.821
Havoc Base
to Bravo 1.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.609
Havoc, this is 1.

27:05.660 --> 27:09.005
ERIC:
Yeah, ISR just picked up
Bravo 2's helmet strobe.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.927
Copy that.
Send us the coordinates.

27:11.970 --> 27:14.757
A-firm, 1. Sending now.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.017
Bravo 1, be advised.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.846
ISR also shows enemy moving

27:17.890 --> 27:20.199
towards the area where
Bravo 2's strobe was spotted.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.845
Copy that. We'll just have
to get to him before they do.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.288
Bravo 1 out.

27:24.330 --> 27:26.469
Jace, unless we grow wings,

27:26.510 --> 27:28.501
we ain't getting to him in time.

27:31.340 --> 27:33.729
I have an idea.

28:05.290 --> 28:07.542
ERIC:
Got to admit,
Jason's clever.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.672
Getting to Ray
is not what's concerning me.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.028
They're pushing deeper
into Pir Chinasi.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.811
ERIC: Getting out is
on Jason's shoulders now.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.033
Maybe not.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.689
Oh, good horse.

28:24.740 --> 28:26.731
Little skinny,
but she sure got a lot of spunk.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.781
Too steep for horses.
Keep them here.

28:32.230 --> 28:33.390
Havoc, this is 1.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.576
Yeah, go for Havoc.

28:34.620 --> 28:35.439
Still got a bead

28:35.490 --> 28:36.832
on Bravo 2's helmet strobe?

28:36.880 --> 28:38.438
Monero?Yes, sir.

28:38.490 --> 28:40.367
Still lighting off in
the same spot right here.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.537
Bravo 1,
the strobe is still flashing

28:42.590 --> 28:44.933
at the same location.Copy that.

28:44.980 --> 28:48.199
He's probably, uh,
hunkered down somewhere.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.639
No, he wouldn't stop now.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.375
Might be injured.Ray's okay.

28:51.420 --> 28:52.978
I got a feeling.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.463
Let's keep looking.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.330
There's no chance
I'm authorlzmg

28:58.380 --> 28:59.904
an Indian-led QRF.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.737
Your military regularly
runs operations

29:02.780 --> 29:05.647
in and out of Kashmir.Not the point.

29:05.700 --> 29:09.784
Look, I understand why
you want Khan dead.

29:09.830 --> 29:13.209
But this mess has_been created
by your military,

29:13.270 --> 29:16.398
and you'll have to deal
with the fallout.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.611
Bashir Varma.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.184
Maybe not the same threat
as Khan,

29:22.230 --> 29:24.698
but how many Indians
has Bashir killed?

29:24.760 --> 29:28.059
Soldiers and civilians.

29:28.110 --> 29:30.499
We know where Bashir is.

29:32.550 --> 29:34.506
So?

29:34.550 --> 29:37.804
By the time you're cleared
to share his information,

29:37.860 --> 29:39.418
this will all be over.

29:39.470 --> 29:42.109
And, if I'm being honest,

29:42.170 --> 29:43.239
your men will be dead.

29:46.650 --> 29:49.118
I know his location.

29:49.170 --> 29:51.126
You would really do that?

29:51.180 --> 29:52.829
Leak it?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.836
Call to prayer is soon.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.189
People are gonna notice
you missing.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.186
I'm in a bit of a dilemma here.

30:09.190 --> 30:11.329
Men to the south,
the village is north.

30:11.370 --> 30:13.144
Six months ago,

30:13.200 --> 30:16.192
I would have tied you up,
taken my chances out there.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.156
Trusted this was all part
of some plan.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.021
Now I don't see a plan
in any of this.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.556
In anything.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.342
I see you versus me.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.517
One of us will live.

30:32.560 --> 30:35.302
One of us will die.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.581
Sonny!

30:59.200 --> 31:00.974
Oh, no.

31:01.030 --> 31:04.409
Ray could've fallen
over the edge.

31:05.420 --> 31:07.069
JASON:
Where is he?

31:14.650 --> 31:17.733
Well, I'm glad you're feeling
better. I still don't get why

31:17.780 --> 31:19.088
you wouldn't let me see you
at the hospital.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.041
I shut myself off
from the rest of the world

31:21.090 --> 31:22.432
after I got blown up.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.745
Didn't, uh, didn't think
you'd understand.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.917
My son was hurt.
What's to understand?

31:27.970 --> 31:29.267
Still getting used
to you acknowledging

31:29.320 --> 31:30.924
that you have a son.

31:30.970 --> 31:33.928
You know, I always feel like

31:33.970 --> 31:35.141
I'm bringing a knife
to a gunfight

31:35.190 --> 31:36.361
when we're together.

31:39.850 --> 31:41.841
What'd you want
to see me for, anyway?

31:44.380 --> 31:46.678
Brett Swann.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.948
The team guy that offed himself?

31:48.990 --> 31:50.594
He's a friend.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.905
What was the deal, then? PTSD?

31:53.950 --> 31:55.906
He had_ a traumatic
braIn Injury,

31:55.950 --> 31:57.941
and the VA wouldn't treat it
'cause it wasn't documented

31:58.000 --> 31:59.479
as a combat injury.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.306
That's a shame.

32:03.260 --> 32:05.216
I'm trying to get
Brett a Purple Heart.

32:05.270 --> 32:07.044
I'm hoping

32:07.090 --> 32:09.263
that the military will start
acknowledging TBI cases

32:09.310 --> 32:10.959
for vets in the
same boat as Brett.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.921
[chuckles] Look at you.

32:12.970 --> 32:16.929
My son, the maverick,
wanting to fight the system.

32:16.970 --> 32:19.018
It's a worthy fight.

32:20.930 --> 32:22.409
Military's not gonna
want you generating

32:22.460 --> 32:24.360
that kind of publicity.

32:27.290 --> 32:29.542
That's why I'm here.

32:29.590 --> 32:32.502
I'm, uh... You know, nobody
knows publicity like you.

32:32.550 --> 32:33.983
Oh.

32:34.030 --> 32:35.907
You want to use my position
at the network

32:35.950 --> 32:37.724
to push your message.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.862
It's not a message,
it's a mission.

32:39.910 --> 32:41.901
Not a lot to ask
after you used me

32:41.960 --> 32:43.905
for information to keep
yourself in that position.

32:46.050 --> 32:48.780
It's an admirable cause, son,
but it's not gonna happen.

32:48.830 --> 32:51.697
[scoffs]
That defeatist attitude...

32:51.750 --> 32:53.229
It's a good thing
we weren't fighting

32:53.270 --> 32:55.090
any wars
while you were operating.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.870
You know what, I get it, Clay.
I was a crappy father, okay?

32:57.930 --> 32:59.704
But even an old frogman
like me

32:59.760 --> 33:02.012
is only gonna tolerate
so much abuse.

33:03.670 --> 33:06.889
Hundreds of thousands
of vets suffer from TBI.

33:06.940 --> 33:09.761
You could be their
voice, their champion.

33:11.770 --> 33:15.149
Maybe, maybe this is the war
you've been looking for.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.380
I just thought maybe
you'd want to do something

33:21.430 --> 33:23.773
to make your son proud.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.433
Oh, no.

33:35.570 --> 33:37.049
There's not much time now.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.002
Maybe... maybe I can make it
over the ravine.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.143
Yeah. Over the ravine before
you get the word out about me.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.146
[panﬁng]

33:46.190 --> 33:48.192
No. No.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.844
No, I wouldn't make it.

33:49.890 --> 33:52.973
The smartest thing I can do
is kill you and run.

33:55.550 --> 33:58.018
Why should I trade my life
for yours?

34:02.080 --> 34:03.809
[praying quietly]

34:03.860 --> 34:06.078
Stop.

34:06.130 --> 34:07.336

34:07.390 --> 34:10.348
Stop it. There is no one
up there to hear you.

34:11.740 --> 34:13.469

34:20.050 --> 34:21.483
Metal, anything?

34:21.530 --> 34:23.998
Looks like he came down
that hill pretty hard.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.573
How about you?

34:25.620 --> 34:27.406
One set of tracks
down by the river.

I will pull this trigger.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.236
[quietly]:
Don't make me kill you.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.714
I don't want to kill you.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.492
Stop, damn it.

35:54.540 --> 35:55.837
Stop! [gasps]

35:55.890 --> 35:57.926
I will kill you.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.936
Ain't nothin' stopping me.

36:02.550 --> 36:05.371
There's nothing stopping me.

36:05.420 --> 36:07.411
Not anymore.
