00:10.933 --> 00:12.354
Uh, yeah...

00:12.502 --> 00:15.256

vegetables and white rice?

00:15.404 --> 00:17.257
Okay, mixed vegetables,
white rice.

00:17.406 --> 00:18.525
Damn, Du'.

00:18.674 --> 00:20.226

00:23.009 --> 00:25.307

Look at this nigger

00:30.516 --> 00:32.203

gangster.

00:32.351 --> 00:33.837
Yeah, Na'
a righteous hustler.

00:33.985 --> 00:35.572
Man, I'm just treating
y'all, that's all.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.706
You know I like to keep it
real with the little people.

00:37.855 --> 00:38.980
Man, fuck you, man.

00:40.323 --> 00:42.655
- I was talking about you.
- I was talking about you.

00:45.728 --> 00:46.814
May I help you?

00:46.961 --> 00:49.157
Can I order the yakame
with turkey grease?

00:50.198 --> 00:51.851
Yakame, noodles--

00:52.000 --> 00:54.387
- This nigger ordered turkey grease.
- What's wrong, yo?

00:54.535 --> 00:56.088
I mean, my mom,

00:56.235 --> 00:58.557
Yo, you is really one of
them at-risk children,

00:58.705 --> 01:01.560
- you know that, Dukie?
- Yo, man, leave him alone, son.

01:01.707 --> 01:02.660
Yeah, I got it.
How much?

01:02.808 --> 01:03.761
- $4.00.
- Why is it so funny?

01:03.910 --> 01:04.962
They just
goofin' on you.

01:05.110 --> 01:06.229
What's wrong with
me ordering yakame?

01:06.378 --> 01:07.597
Nothing wrong with
you ordering yakame.

01:07.746 --> 01:09.499
It's just the turkey grease
that makes the drunks,

01:09.647 --> 01:11.834
you know, throw up all that
liquor they was drinking,

01:11.981 --> 01:14.279
go back to swilling
that shit.

01:17.620 --> 01:18.506
Man, this shit is good.

01:18.654 --> 01:19.640
Why don't you
buy your own food?

01:19.788 --> 01:20.675
This is all you getting.

01:20.823 --> 01:22.476
Don't ask for
no more of that.

01:22.623 --> 01:24.010
That shit
tastes good as hell.

01:24.158 --> 01:27.313
Yo, y'all heard about
what happened to Little Kevin?

01:27.461 --> 01:28.347
What?

01:28.495 --> 01:29.847
He be dead.

01:29.996 --> 01:31.916
- He up in them vacants.
- Why?

01:32.065 --> 01:34.055
Fucked up somewhere,
I suppose.

01:35.835 --> 01:37.088
Uh-oh.

01:37.235 --> 01:40.023
What the fuck you little
hoppers doing on my avenue?

01:40.171 --> 01:41.490
- Eating.
- Shit you are.

01:41.639 --> 01:43.793
You're probably setting up
to snatch a purse.

01:43.941 --> 01:45.061
Get the fuck back
on the reservation

01:45.209 --> 01:47.063
where your
black asses belong.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.496
How you feeling,
little man?

01:48.644 --> 01:51.999
Need a hand with that food?

01:52.147 --> 01:54.206
I said get.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.976
Yo, y'all hear that shit?
"My avenue."

02:04.123 --> 02:05.978
It's just as much
ours as it is his.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.144
Walker be evil, yo.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.645
He be thieving and
smackin' folk down.

02:08.794 --> 02:09.814
Yo, we should
get him back

02:09.961 --> 02:11.881
on the payback tip
for all the dirt he do.

02:12.030 --> 02:14.150
You want to throw
down with police?

02:14.298 --> 02:15.485
I don't mean
go at him direct,

02:15.632 --> 02:17.152
but, you know, hurt him.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.154
Like, slash his tires
or some shit.

02:20.303 --> 02:23.491
We could stick
condoms on his car.

02:23.638 --> 02:24.826
That'd send a message.

02:24.973 --> 02:26.360
Yeah, but what kind?

02:26.508 --> 02:28.195
We should slap bumper stickers
on his windshield.

02:28.343 --> 02:30.463
I mean, they
is hard to get off.

02:30.612 --> 02:31.964
Hold on,
wait wait wait.

02:32.112 --> 02:34.933
Do Officer Walker
go to that club on Stockton,

02:35.082 --> 02:36.434
the one where
the Western police party?

02:36.582 --> 02:39.336
I seen his car there.

02:39.485 --> 02:42.146
I got this one.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:23.100 --> 04:24.954
And as much as I empathize,

04:25.102 --> 04:27.090
I can only tell you
that there is a process

04:27.237 --> 04:28.290
for complaints
like this one.

04:28.439 --> 04:30.625
Don't sell us on process,
Mr. Mayor.

04:30.773 --> 04:33.461
We've had years of this kind
of treatment from city police.

04:33.609 --> 04:34.595
You need to understand

04:34.743 --> 04:36.263
we view this as an affront
to the cloth.

04:36.411 --> 04:38.865
We've asked for
a civilian review board

04:39.014 --> 04:42.168
for decades now.
Absent that, how can we trust

04:42.315 --> 04:44.471
any investigation
of any complaint?

04:44.618 --> 04:47.472
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but last I checked,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.173
the department had
a black commissioner

04:49.321 --> 04:51.142
and a black
l.I.D. director.

04:51.289 --> 04:53.010
The problem is systemic.

04:53.157 --> 04:54.478
And as to
Commissioner Burrell--

04:54.626 --> 04:58.314
we understand that
his authority is now limited.

04:58.462 --> 05:00.449
Mr. Mayor, when it comes
to matters like this one,

05:00.597 --> 05:03.752
do you expect us to have
faith in Deputy Rawls?

05:03.900 --> 05:05.153
I expect you'll
be good enough

05:05.300 --> 05:06.587
not to prejudge
the department's response

05:06.736 --> 05:08.522
before the investigation
even begins,

05:08.670 --> 05:10.057
as I won't prejudge it.

05:10.205 --> 05:12.926
I can only tell you that l
take this incident very seriously,

05:13.073 --> 05:16.065
and that I will pursue
all of the facts.

05:19.212 --> 05:20.331
Well, Mr. Mayor,

05:20.480 --> 05:21.833
you said you would
have an open door,

05:21.980 --> 05:24.735
and so far I credit you
for keeping that promise.

05:24.883 --> 05:27.271
And my door will always
be open to you.

05:27.418 --> 05:28.749
Thank you.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.378
If they couldn't get civilian review
out of a Royce administration,

05:37.526 --> 05:39.113
how can they think
they're gonna get it from me?

05:39.261 --> 05:40.448
They're just
testing you here,

05:40.595 --> 05:42.649
trying to see how vulnerable
you feel on the racial stuff.

05:42.797 --> 05:44.284
On Burrell, too,
for what it's worth.

05:44.432 --> 05:46.285
Well, civilian review
is a nonstarter.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.787
You go now there now,

05:47.935 --> 05:50.755
you'll be bending over
for four years for the ministers.

05:50.904 --> 05:51.790
So what?
I throw them a bone

05:51.939 --> 05:53.258
and fire some idiot cop?

05:53.406 --> 05:54.826
By pressing that,
the average beat cop's

05:54.973 --> 05:56.293
gonna hate my guts,
and I ain't gonna change

05:56.442 --> 05:58.295
anything around without
rank-and-file support.

05:58.443 --> 05:59.830
You don't fire him,
you're going to piss off

05:59.978 --> 06:01.865
most of the black
political infrastructure.

06:02.012 --> 06:05.778
Mm, yummy.
My first bowl of shit.

06:12.888 --> 06:15.408
Circle that
right there.

06:15.557 --> 06:17.524
And you press
that right there.

06:22.896 --> 06:24.749
It's work time.

06:24.898 --> 06:26.751
You guys got work to do?
You write down that data?

06:26.900 --> 06:28.525
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:31.402 --> 06:33.056
Charlene, what don't
you understand?

06:33.204 --> 06:34.758
None of it.

06:34.906 --> 06:37.259
Okay, let's see if we can find a way
you can get it, okay?

06:37.407 --> 06:38.459
What's the diameter?

06:38.608 --> 06:40.061
- Huh?
- It's seven.

06:40.209 --> 06:42.297
Good. Okay,
what's half of that?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.264
You can't take half of it.

06:44.413 --> 06:45.599
Okay, let's say
you have $10

06:45.748 --> 06:47.167
and you gave
half of it to Jasmine.

06:47.315 --> 06:49.269
Why I do that?

06:49.416 --> 06:52.271
Well, just pretend, okay?

06:52.419 --> 06:53.839
You give her half,
how much does she have?

06:53.988 --> 06:55.774
- Duh, $5.
- Good.

06:55.922 --> 06:57.776
Now let's say this
time you have $7

06:57.924 --> 07:00.277
and you give her half,
how much does she have?

07:00.425 --> 07:01.879
$3.50.

07:02.027 --> 07:05.715
Good, so...

07:05.863 --> 07:09.525
Yo, Mr. Prez,
check this out.

07:11.501 --> 07:12.832
Oh!

07:18.040 --> 07:20.393
Why we no pick him up at his casa,
follow him from there?

07:20.541 --> 07:22.362
Why, so we can
lose him here again?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.964
Papa, nothin' say he got to come back
through this way, you know?

07:25.113 --> 07:26.065
What if he take
another road...?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.432
All right.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.673
We pick him up
from his casa tomorrow.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.905
Poutin'.
Don't pout.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.540
Omar, I'm tired
of this, bro.

07:36.688 --> 07:41.215
Lo siento, baby.
Lo siento.

07:45.128 --> 07:47.749
Hey, now...

07:47.897 --> 07:50.228
there she blow.

08:02.842 --> 08:04.095
All right, then.

08:04.243 --> 08:05.796
So we agree staring down

08:05.944 --> 08:08.832
a stick-up boy on a corner
takes courage,

08:08.981 --> 08:10.767
and we agree it takes
courage to go overnight

08:10.915 --> 08:12.668
to Cheltenham or Hickey.

08:12.817 --> 08:14.003
This is a good list,

08:14.152 --> 08:15.738
but are there any
examples we can make

08:15.886 --> 08:19.374
outside of being
on a corner?

08:19.522 --> 08:21.353
I need a volunteer.

08:22.524 --> 08:23.543
Not me.

08:23.692 --> 08:25.245
What about you, Albert?

08:25.393 --> 08:26.646
No.

08:26.795 --> 08:28.347
You volunteer
and you don't know what for,

08:28.496 --> 08:29.882
you ain't got brains.

08:30.030 --> 08:31.050
All right, then,

08:31.198 --> 08:33.217
I need a volunteer
to stand on this box

08:33.366 --> 08:36.087
blindfolded, fall off,
and let us catch him

08:36.235 --> 08:37.496
before he hits the ground.

08:40.172 --> 08:41.057
Albert?

08:41.206 --> 08:42.558
That's fucking stupid.

08:42.706 --> 08:44.893
What about you, Namond?

08:45.042 --> 08:46.895
Wait wait wait,
let me get this right.

08:47.044 --> 08:48.730
So you want me to stand up
on that box,

08:48.878 --> 08:51.066
put a blindfold on, fall,

08:51.214 --> 08:54.568
and expect these
weak-ass clowns to catch me?

08:54.716 --> 08:56.377
Hell, no.

09:01.389 --> 09:02.341
Hey, yo, y'all drop me,

09:02.490 --> 09:03.786
and we gonna have
more than words.

09:05.492 --> 09:07.179
A'ight.

09:07.326 --> 09:10.159
All right, everybody
gather around.

09:13.164 --> 09:14.324
Oh, shit.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.988
You ready? On three.

09:19.136 --> 09:22.190
One, two, three.

09:22.339 --> 09:24.392
Let him drop.

09:24.540 --> 09:28.362
Whoa! Shit!
Oh, that shit was right.

09:28.510 --> 09:29.863
All right,
who wants to go next?

09:30.011 --> 09:31.030
Albert?

09:31.179 --> 09:33.200
I ain't doing no
stupid shit like that!

09:33.347 --> 09:35.814
Fuck you, and fuck all
y'all bitches.

09:41.687 --> 09:43.374
We don't like
your ass anyway.

09:43.522 --> 09:44.955
Settle down,
settle down.

09:48.259 --> 09:50.646
Yo, today's specials
are those little Hershey bars,

09:50.795 --> 09:52.382
three for a dime.

09:52.529 --> 09:54.116
And I got all your
other favorites, too.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.284
Yo, Deante,
I got your licorice--

09:56.432 --> 09:57.785
red and black both.

09:57.933 --> 09:59.832
Snitchin' Randy.

10:17.215 --> 10:19.736
Well, I'll be blessed, yo.
Lookit.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.471
This is good?
We put him here?

10:21.619 --> 10:24.073
That tall man with Prop Joe?

10:24.220 --> 10:26.108
Yo, for real,
on this caper

10:26.256 --> 10:28.076
the more we learn,
the less we know.

10:28.224 --> 10:31.078
- We can go?
- No, we stay.

10:31.226 --> 10:32.413
Papa, I need to go.

10:32.561 --> 10:34.414
I say we stay, Renaldo.
What's wrong, yo?

10:34.563 --> 10:35.688
No no, I mean "go."

10:37.398 --> 10:38.985
We been in the car
too many hours.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.252
Whether you squat in an alley

10:40.401 --> 10:42.254
or sittin' on
a porcelain throne,

10:42.402 --> 10:45.838
don't really change
the moment, now do it?

10:47.907 --> 10:49.067
Rough day?

10:51.409 --> 10:52.995
Doesn't help to hold it in.

10:53.144 --> 10:56.265
What the fuck you know?

10:56.413 --> 11:00.577
If you tell me,
maybe we can help.

11:03.251 --> 11:05.539
Ain't nothing.

11:05.688 --> 11:08.975
Look, come on, Albert, you been
doing real good in this class.

11:09.124 --> 11:11.182
Real good till today.

11:15.528 --> 11:17.689
Just give it a try.

11:24.035 --> 11:28.524
I went home yesterday.
My mom's on the couch.

11:28.673 --> 11:30.659
She dead.

11:30.807 --> 11:33.901
Me-maw said best l
come to school, but...

11:36.278 --> 11:39.566
Oh.

11:39.714 --> 11:42.376
Yeah, you wanted
to be with your mom.

11:44.385 --> 11:46.443
Of course you did.

11:47.588 --> 11:49.909
Some of you know me
from narcotics work,

11:50.056 --> 11:52.209
some from earlier if you
worked the Western district,

11:52.358 --> 11:53.844
and some of you I'm meeting
for the first time.

11:53.993 --> 11:56.280
But the only point l'd
really like to make here today

11:56.428 --> 11:58.281
is that this is
a transitional time

11:58.430 --> 12:00.850
for this department
and for the city as a whole.

12:00.998 --> 12:03.218
We have a new mayor
and a new state's attorney,

12:03.366 --> 12:06.028
and they both feel like
they have a mandate for change.

12:08.337 --> 12:11.625
The point is that given
the mayor's position on crime

12:11.772 --> 12:14.294
and given the outcome of the election,
we can expect certain enhancements.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.861
Oh, really?

12:16.010 --> 12:18.897
Certain improvements may be
forthcoming in the near future.

12:19.046 --> 12:20.566
So we're looking
for feedback here,

12:20.714 --> 12:21.632
some input
as to what we need

12:21.781 --> 12:24.368
more of or less of
to better work murders.

12:24.516 --> 12:27.104
- Better witness protection.
- More proactive investigation.

12:27.253 --> 12:28.239
Pay raise.

12:28.386 --> 12:30.373
Yeah!

12:30.521 --> 12:33.008
Better lab work. More techs
on duty. More overtime.

12:33.156 --> 12:34.944
More Scotch!

12:35.092 --> 12:37.213
More time for case prep.
Seriously.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.347
More women.
Loose women.

12:39.495 --> 12:41.382
Pay hike, double-digits.

12:41.529 --> 12:43.917
Mo' better,
mo' better, mo' better.

12:44.065 --> 12:46.362
That's what we want.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.056
Sounds like a new day,
don't it?

12:50.204 --> 12:52.424
Department's finally gonna
get what it needs.

12:52.573 --> 12:54.226
State's attorney's
office, too.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.560
A new day.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.262
They make a nice
couple, anyway.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.878
Looking forward to working
with you, Colonel.

13:02.813 --> 13:05.001
That's signed by
a now-inaugurated mayor

13:05.148 --> 13:08.604
ordering his police commanders
to avoid mass arrests.

13:08.752 --> 13:09.872
Community-based policing

13:10.020 --> 13:12.273
and high-end enforcements
are to be emphasized.

13:12.422 --> 13:13.608
I take it Burrell
got a copy.

13:13.756 --> 13:15.676
In person.

13:15.823 --> 13:17.211
I don't see it.

13:17.358 --> 13:19.245
Why not just fire
the fucking asshole?

13:19.394 --> 13:20.714
The mayor is weighing
his options.

13:20.861 --> 13:21.881
What the fuck
does that mean?

13:22.030 --> 13:23.482
To fire Burrell,
we're going to need more

13:23.630 --> 13:26.152
political capital
than we have right now.

13:26.299 --> 13:29.486
Speaking of which,
it brings us to another

13:29.635 --> 13:31.022
Iittle piece of business.

13:31.169 --> 13:34.091
- The thing with the minister.
- It's a delicate situation.

13:34.239 --> 13:36.193
The ministers are pressing
for a civilian review,

13:36.340 --> 13:38.227
which I know the rank and file
don't want to hear,

13:38.375 --> 13:40.930
but it speaks directly to
the situation with Burrell.

13:41.077 --> 13:43.532
If we expend capital
defending this incident--

13:43.680 --> 13:45.866
I get it.
You want the cop fired.

13:46.015 --> 13:47.601
No, we're not saying
that at all.

13:47.749 --> 13:49.002
The mayor doesn't
want to interfere with

13:49.151 --> 13:52.705
the everyday workings
of the department.

13:52.853 --> 13:54.873
But it's a balancing act.

13:55.022 --> 13:57.876
Our response has to be
smart and evenhanded,

13:58.024 --> 13:59.711
in a racial sense, especially.

13:59.859 --> 14:01.546
If I'm hearing you,
it's about perception.

14:01.694 --> 14:03.481
Exactly.

14:03.629 --> 14:05.316
I.I.D. has
a black commander,

14:05.463 --> 14:07.317
but he's beholden to Burrell.

14:07.465 --> 14:10.456
He'll stir shit
with this if he can.

14:12.370 --> 14:15.423
The sergeant in question
is assigned to C.I.D.

14:15.571 --> 14:17.258
His new commander
is Daniels.

14:17.406 --> 14:21.329
He's smart, he's black,
and politically neutral.

14:21.476 --> 14:25.469
- That work for you?
- Works for us.

14:33.986 --> 14:37.648
Who that?
I said, who's that?

14:46.162 --> 14:47.849
You home or you
just visiting?

14:47.997 --> 14:51.352
Home if I can.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.333
All right. Get by the fire
if you want.

14:58.005 --> 15:01.064
I got a couple of dogs left.
You hungry?

15:07.747 --> 15:09.634
Shit weren't working
out with Jo-Jo and them.

15:09.781 --> 15:12.135
Said I owed him some cheddar
on some shit some other boy did.

15:12.282 --> 15:13.704
I don't want to make
no noise on that, though.

15:13.851 --> 15:15.046
They pressin' you.

15:17.454 --> 15:19.107
You know...

15:19.256 --> 15:22.810
get with me, and we pay
'em right back, okay?

15:22.959 --> 15:23.979
No, all that shit
you been sayin' to me

15:24.126 --> 15:25.145
goin' through my head.

15:25.293 --> 15:26.646
Forget about that.
Forget about all that.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.148
If I wouldn't have
pushed you off,

15:28.295 --> 15:29.616
you would have never
been up on that corner.

15:29.764 --> 15:31.651
But everything I do
I be fucking up.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.819
Whole time it feel like it
wasn't me on that corner.

15:33.968 --> 15:36.128
I just wanted to get away.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.659
Well, you're here now,
ain't you? Right?

15:41.807 --> 15:45.765
This is you, right here,
right now, okay?

15:47.811 --> 15:49.666
You're burning a hole
in that shirt, man.

15:49.813 --> 15:50.833
Fuck-- you fucked me
all up when

15:50.980 --> 15:52.234
I saw you walking through
the door, Sherrod.

15:52.382 --> 15:54.269
Oh, shit.

15:54.417 --> 15:55.503
What you think, huh?

15:55.651 --> 15:57.838
You know, I get
half price for this.

15:57.987 --> 15:59.172
All right,
take your hat off, man.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.483
Don't burn them
pimp steaks, huh?

16:11.931 --> 16:14.091
Took long enough.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.756
Yo, Dukie,
you sure about this?

16:20.905 --> 16:23.859
I mean,
I'm with y'all.

16:24.007 --> 16:25.427
Y'all my boys like that.

16:25.574 --> 16:27.962
Y'all there for me,
I'm there for y'all.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.965
I'm really starting to think
this is some fucked-up shit.

16:31.113 --> 16:33.633
I mean, Officer Walker's
a shady motherfucker,

16:33.781 --> 16:37.304
but he's police.

16:37.451 --> 16:39.305
We do it Michael's way,
we send a message.

16:39.453 --> 16:42.907
You ain't got to do
what I got to do.

16:43.055 --> 16:45.113
We drew straws, Na'.

17:07.075 --> 17:08.473
Let's go.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.436
This is everything?

17:19.585 --> 17:21.604
Sergeant Hauk's statement,
the ministers',

17:21.752 --> 17:23.940
statements of the other
officers-- it's all there.

17:24.088 --> 17:25.608
No independent witnesses, huh?

17:25.755 --> 17:26.775
It's a lot of smoke,

17:26.924 --> 17:28.277
but I'm not feeling much
in the way of fire.

17:28.425 --> 17:30.112
It was a strong case
for discourtesy.

17:30.259 --> 17:33.281
True, but no indication of
racial or religious overtones.

17:33.429 --> 17:36.616
And the brutality
allegation is a stretch.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.952
I've gone over G.O.C.-7.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.287
I'm up to speed
with the matrix,

17:41.435 --> 17:43.456
but since the buck stops
with me on this one,

17:43.604 --> 17:45.458
walk me through my options.

17:45.605 --> 17:49.793
Minor offenses, you can
issue a summary judgment--

17:49.942 --> 17:51.596
a period of extra
duty without pay,

17:51.743 --> 17:53.630
guidance and counseling,
the like.

17:53.778 --> 17:55.733
Or if Sergeant Hauk
fights your decision

17:55.880 --> 17:57.567
or if there's a more
substantive charge,

17:57.715 --> 17:59.335
it goes downstairs
to a trial board.

17:59.483 --> 18:01.473
And possible termination?

18:06.388 --> 18:08.576
Let me ask you--

18:08.724 --> 18:10.744
if the minister's connected,

18:10.892 --> 18:13.246
and if all eyes
are on this one,

18:13.394 --> 18:15.248
what does command
want to see happen?

18:15.395 --> 18:16.849
What does City Hall
want to see happen?

18:16.997 --> 18:19.917
City Hall just wants
someone to do the right thing,

18:20.066 --> 18:21.420
whatever that is.

18:21.567 --> 18:22.487
You're sitting here, Deputy,

18:22.635 --> 18:24.589
telling me to just
do the right thing?

18:24.736 --> 18:27.569
Doesn't happen often,
I know.

18:51.257 --> 18:54.225
Hey! What are you doing?
Come here!

18:56.862 --> 18:59.831
You motherfucker,
I'll get your little ass!

19:01.299 --> 19:02.719
Hey hey hey!

19:02.867 --> 19:04.888
Come on,
show me hands, bitch.

19:05.035 --> 19:07.389
Back the fuck up,
little hopper, I'm police.

19:07.536 --> 19:08.489
Yeah, I know,
you the police who like

19:08.637 --> 19:10.658
to fuck with a nigger.
Turn around.

19:10.806 --> 19:12.501
Hey hey, yo!

19:14.042 --> 19:16.062
You ain't gonna
hear the next one.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.898
Get on your knees,
cross them legs,

19:18.046 --> 19:19.945
knit them hands, come on.

19:23.050 --> 19:26.070
Ooh, hold on.

19:26.218 --> 19:28.071
Yo, what the
fuck you doing?

19:28.220 --> 19:29.406
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

19:29.555 --> 19:33.076
Hey, give up that ring, man.

19:33.223 --> 19:35.054
Come on.

19:36.393 --> 19:38.053
Yeah.

19:43.231 --> 19:44.994
Aah!

19:46.068 --> 19:48.922
Ha ha ha!
Payback.

19:49.071 --> 19:50.970
That's right.
Run, motherfuckers!

19:52.405 --> 19:54.237
Shit!

20:07.919 --> 20:08.939
I'm telling you,
right there,

20:09.086 --> 20:11.606
this horse is a winner.
Look at it, okay?

20:11.755 --> 20:13.108
How you doing?

20:13.255 --> 20:14.542
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

20:14.690 --> 20:15.844
Mr. Mayor.

20:15.992 --> 20:18.779
On my way downtown today
I saw an abandoned car.

20:18.927 --> 20:19.947
Tow it right away.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.282
Where is-- Mr. Mayor,
the location?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.451
Oh, fucking Christ.
Call Transpo!

20:25.599 --> 20:26.963
Get the fucking
trucks moving!

20:33.405 --> 20:34.291
Uh-- Mr. Mayor.

20:34.439 --> 20:35.526
I got a constituent call.

20:35.674 --> 20:37.994
She said the playground
near her house was a hazard.

20:38.142 --> 20:39.963
- Rusted metal.
- We'll get right on it.

20:40.111 --> 20:41.564
The location?

20:41.711 --> 20:43.233
Sir, I need a location.

20:43.380 --> 20:45.870
Mr. Mayor, I understand your concern,
but you've got to understand,

20:47.984 --> 20:49.303
we have more
than 9,100 hydrants.

20:49.451 --> 20:51.783
And one of them's leaking.

20:52.954 --> 20:54.139
Sensitivity counseling,

20:54.288 --> 20:58.244
two week's extra duty,
no punishment past that.

20:58.392 --> 21:00.479
They sliced it
into the rough.

21:00.626 --> 21:03.581
Does Daniels know the bind
this puts his boy Carcetti in?

21:03.728 --> 21:08.051
Well, Wilson briefed Rawls,
Rawls briefed Daniels.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.320
It's Carcetti
doing Pontius Pilate,

21:10.467 --> 21:12.688
putting it on Daniels,
who was a safe choice

21:12.836 --> 21:14.590
as far as
the rank and file goes.

21:14.738 --> 21:16.092
But that won't be enough
for the ministers,

21:16.239 --> 21:17.798
not by a long shot.

21:24.245 --> 21:28.079
Am I the only one that knows
how to play this game?

21:31.418 --> 21:33.579
Let's go,
get that hydrant sealed.

22:08.581 --> 22:11.035
Three of them with shotguns

22:11.183 --> 22:12.736
got me coming
outside the club.

22:12.883 --> 22:14.203
I made 'em for bloods.

22:14.352 --> 22:17.607
The paint's supposed to be some
kind of declaration of war.

22:17.755 --> 22:19.509
Sounds like we get
to stomp some ass.

22:19.656 --> 22:22.056
The Western District way.

22:24.394 --> 22:27.515
Yellow paint
a declaration of war?

22:27.663 --> 22:29.028
That's a new one.

22:35.769 --> 22:38.023
So what I heard was
that these wild-ass boys--

22:38.170 --> 22:41.292
I ain't saying no names--
but they past crazy.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.594
They robbed him.

22:42.742 --> 22:45.329
They threw paint on his ass--
yellow paint.

22:45.478 --> 22:47.698
Shit, I ain't lying.

22:47.845 --> 22:49.266
Well, I don't know
about that,

22:49.413 --> 22:51.601
but you showed me something
getting on that box like that.

22:51.749 --> 22:52.768
That wasn't nothing.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.569
No, don't sell yourself short.

22:54.718 --> 22:55.937
Ms. Duquette,
Mr. Parenti,

22:56.086 --> 22:57.438
we all thought
it took courage,

22:57.587 --> 22:59.274
especially considering
how y'all do each other.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.774
You think?

23:00.922 --> 23:02.542
Yeah.

23:02.691 --> 23:05.812
No, look, you're showing
a lot of progress in class.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.379
I mean, you know that,
don't you?

23:07.528 --> 23:10.582
You know, you're doing
the work. You're not acting out.

23:10.730 --> 23:12.084
It's getting
to the point where

23:12.232 --> 23:14.885
You can go back to regular
class, no problem.

23:15.033 --> 23:17.154
- Back to genpop?
- Mm-hmm.

23:17.301 --> 23:18.789
You want me to go?

23:18.936 --> 23:21.699
Well,
if you're ready.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.461
I ain't going back there.

23:25.609 --> 23:27.562
Why not?

23:27.711 --> 23:30.965
Shit they teach
there be deadly.

23:31.113 --> 23:34.534
But I know
you know that, Bunny.

23:34.682 --> 23:37.069
All right, all right!
All right, all right!

23:37.218 --> 23:39.005
We can squeeze a little
money from here and there

23:39.153 --> 23:41.107
but nothing on the scale
for what you're asking.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.742
Maybe free up
some operating money

23:42.889 --> 23:45.243
by shifting some of these
PAYGO projects

23:45.390 --> 23:46.645
into the capital program.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.413
I can steal a little from
the budget stabilization fund,

23:49.561 --> 23:52.882
but we still got to absorb
1 20 grant positions

23:53.031 --> 23:54.851
in the police department,
mostly officers.

23:54.999 --> 23:57.086
Christ, don't let
those go unfunded.

23:57.233 --> 23:59.554
A lot of balls in the air, and I still
haven't seen the schools' budget.

23:59.702 --> 24:01.356
What about
the revenue surplus?

24:01.503 --> 24:03.225
As I said,
that's one-time money.

24:03.372 --> 24:06.259
If I'm going to give
the police a 5% raise, that's forever.

24:06.408 --> 24:07.695
If I'm going to ask the police
department to get up

24:07.842 --> 24:08.729
on its hind legs and fight

24:08.876 --> 24:09.763
I got to throw some money.

24:09.911 --> 24:11.531
You're telling me how I can't
do it, not how I can.

24:11.678 --> 24:13.032
There's the rainy day fund,

24:13.181 --> 24:15.199
but you really shouldn't
draw that down.

24:15.348 --> 24:18.102
The bond rating houses want
at least 5% of the budget in reserve.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.405
Feels like a rainy day to me.

24:20.553 --> 24:23.474
Cloudy like a motherfucker.

24:23.621 --> 24:25.815
Yo, yo, wait up, yo.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.286
- Fuck is up with y'all?
- Ain't you, Mike?

24:39.434 --> 24:41.921
We wanna have a word
with your boy here.

24:42.069 --> 24:45.323
- Ain't nothing stopping you. Talk.
- You know what we mean.

24:45.472 --> 24:47.059
Yo, the little bitch
was talking to the police.

24:47.207 --> 24:48.427
That's a lie.
I ain't been doin' no snitching.

24:48.575 --> 24:49.561
The fuck you ain't.

24:49.709 --> 24:52.430
He look like he about to pee
on hisself right now, man.

24:52.579 --> 24:55.603
You ain't gonna stand by
no rat motherfucker, is you?

25:03.486 --> 25:06.454
Naw, I ain't standing
with no rat.

25:18.832 --> 25:20.218
These here be them
18-hour junks.

25:20.367 --> 25:22.187
Go to bed, wake up,
still be hot.

25:22.335 --> 25:26.224
Man, feel this one
from three hours ago.

25:26.371 --> 25:27.691
See what I'm saying?
Two for one.

25:27.839 --> 25:31.027
Each pack come with two pads.
Buy five, I give you six.

25:31.175 --> 25:32.361
Gimmie six then.

25:32.509 --> 25:34.697
Five.
Keep toasty.

25:34.845 --> 25:36.531
Obliged, sir, obliged.

25:36.679 --> 25:39.868
Take this side,
I'll take this side.

25:40.015 --> 25:41.368
Bubbles Depot.

25:41.516 --> 25:43.037
Bubbles Depot
got what you need.

25:43.185 --> 25:45.939
Back on the scene.
Come see me.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.541
Oh, looky,
looky-- hey, Sherrod!

25:48.688 --> 25:52.044
Whoo-ooh. What up?

25:52.192 --> 25:56.047
Car must've hit it
or some shit.

25:56.195 --> 25:58.049
- How much you think?
- Aluminum?

25:58.197 --> 26:01.218
Aluminum about
30-40¢ a pound.

26:01.366 --> 26:04.199
We've got a Benjamin
here easy, baby.

26:07.971 --> 26:09.157
Teamwork payin' off today,
ain't it, baby?

26:09.306 --> 26:10.326
Yeah.

26:10.473 --> 26:11.565
Go get the heavy side.
Let me try it.

26:15.844 --> 26:18.164
Get out of the way!

26:18.313 --> 26:19.974
That's enough!

26:21.515 --> 26:23.002
Get out of here!

26:23.150 --> 26:24.669
That's enough!
Break it up!

26:24.817 --> 26:26.004
Hey, Randy, you bitch.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.173
We ain't even done
with your snitchin' ass.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.674
Come on, man.

26:30.822 --> 26:33.950
Guess them books
are good for something.

26:37.361 --> 26:39.348
Somebody call the nurse.

26:39.497 --> 26:42.017
Yo, why they bank me?

26:42.165 --> 26:45.133
- I ain't no snitch.
- Randy, Randy, it's okay.

26:52.673 --> 26:54.835
Thanks a lot.

26:59.178 --> 27:01.032
Health Department shut
Chicken George again?

27:01.180 --> 27:02.567
No, I had to duck
in here for cover.

27:02.715 --> 27:04.444
Your boys are
off the hook today.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.978
Not a good day to be
cross-eyed in West Baltimore.

27:18.127 --> 27:20.314
What, y'all behind on your
quotas or some shit?

27:20.462 --> 27:23.317
What the fuck?

27:23.464 --> 27:24.985
Seems one of my side
got jumped last night.

27:25.132 --> 27:27.487
Yeah, Walker.
I heard about that shit.

27:27.634 --> 27:28.726
Threw paint on him.

27:33.306 --> 27:35.296
Walker's an asshole.

27:37.475 --> 27:39.830
Hey, you play in dirt,
you get dirty.

27:39.978 --> 27:42.998
7-Adam-14, do you copy?

27:43.147 --> 27:44.800
Go ahead, KGA.

27:44.948 --> 27:48.169
Report of a burglary
19 North Monroe.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.148
Copy.

27:52.654 --> 27:55.475
We should do this again.

27:55.623 --> 27:57.177
Don't go making
any furtive moves.

27:57.324 --> 27:58.344
No doubt.

27:58.492 --> 28:00.653
Don't break a pencil point.

28:05.998 --> 28:09.934
Mr. P, I swear I only told
the police what everybody knows.

28:14.772 --> 28:16.359
Does that make me
a snitch, Michael?

28:16.507 --> 28:19.027
Shouldn't oughta
told nobody nothing.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.830
But that don't make you a snitch,
not if you ain't put nobody in.

28:21.977 --> 28:23.965
Jesus. I should have
stopped this.

28:24.113 --> 28:25.433
It ain't your fault, Mr. P.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.200
All this come up because
of what Tiffany said

28:27.349 --> 28:28.802
happened in the bathroom.

28:28.950 --> 28:31.137
What did you tell them, Randy?
What do they know?

28:31.284 --> 28:34.138
I just told them about Lex going up
to the playground behind Fulton,

28:34.287 --> 28:35.975
and how everybody
said he got killed

28:36.122 --> 28:37.375
and put in one of them
boarded-up houses.

28:37.523 --> 28:38.810
That's all you told them?

28:38.958 --> 28:42.450
I mean, they wanted me
to say that I was there, but...

28:43.628 --> 28:45.482
I just told them
that Little Kevin told me.

28:45.630 --> 28:47.350
- Little Kevin?
- He killed, too.

28:47.498 --> 28:51.320
I mean, Marlo got him, too. That's
what everybody saying, anyway.

28:51.467 --> 28:53.799
Marlo Stanfield?

28:55.471 --> 28:57.291
I heard Kevin got
locked up just last week,

28:57.439 --> 28:59.226
now he's supposed to be up
in a house somewhere.

28:59.374 --> 29:01.170
They put him in
a vacant, too, huh?

29:03.277 --> 29:07.466
Okay, Randy, for now
I want to say Michael's right.

29:07.614 --> 29:09.568
If anyone tries
to talk to you again,

29:09.715 --> 29:13.104
say nothing to anyone,
understand?

29:13.252 --> 29:15.413
Will that make it better?

29:17.655 --> 29:20.777
So in sum, gentlemen,
the gods have spoken.

29:20.924 --> 29:23.778
No longer do we live
and die by stats.

29:23.927 --> 29:26.381
From this day forward
we are about quality arrests--

29:26.529 --> 29:28.483
felonies, serious misdemeanors,

29:28.631 --> 29:31.451
the back-to-basics police work
of our sainted fathers.

29:31.599 --> 29:33.086
Still, the truth is
it would be easier

29:33.234 --> 29:35.856
to turn an oil tanker
around in a puddle.

29:36.003 --> 29:39.190
Our people were
raised on stats.

29:39.339 --> 29:42.227
If you can't bend patrol
to the mission, Eugene,

29:42.375 --> 29:45.629
I'll damn sure find
someone who can.

29:45.778 --> 29:47.608
Gentlemen.

29:50.781 --> 29:52.271
Sir.

29:55.518 --> 29:57.371
Along the line
of what you propose,

29:57.520 --> 29:59.373
I'd like to reconstitute
the Major Crimes Unit,

29:59.522 --> 30:01.042
bring it under the
umbrella of Homicide.

30:01.191 --> 30:04.312
And let me guess, you'd like
to shake up the personnel.

30:04.459 --> 30:08.314
Where appropriate.

30:08.463 --> 30:10.293
Go for it, Colonel.

30:16.268 --> 30:17.155
What?

30:17.303 --> 30:19.156
Smart move,
accepting any ideas

30:19.304 --> 30:23.160
whatsoever come from
the anointed fella.

30:23.307 --> 30:25.294
Daniels.
The next commissioner.

30:25.442 --> 30:27.263
Any cocksucker that
manages to go from

30:27.411 --> 30:31.333
Iieutenant to full bird in
a little more than a year

30:31.481 --> 30:34.001
is getting groomed.

30:34.150 --> 30:38.305
Wait. You didn't for
a minute think that--

30:38.452 --> 30:41.708
Jesus, Bill,
it's Baltimore.

30:41.856 --> 30:45.313
You ain't one
of the natives, are ya?

30:58.835 --> 31:01.023
You see where they went?

31:01.171 --> 31:03.791
El gordo and tall man,
they go in a big room,

31:03.940 --> 31:05.126
first floor.

31:05.274 --> 31:07.295
Sign outside
say "New Day Coop."

31:07.443 --> 31:11.465
Coop?
What's a coop?

31:11.613 --> 31:13.899
"New Day Coop."
That's what it say.

31:14.047 --> 31:16.902
Hey, yo, was there like a bar
between the two O's?

31:17.050 --> 31:18.304
Si, exacto.

31:18.451 --> 31:20.705
Yeah, that's co-op.

31:20.853 --> 31:22.474
Prop Joe in a co-op?

31:22.621 --> 31:24.641
Joe go in with
the man we robbed.

31:24.789 --> 31:27.076
Remember, he fell
down on his knees,

31:27.225 --> 31:28.444
wept like a little baby.

31:28.593 --> 31:31.913
Yeah, Fat Face Ricky.
Anybody else?

31:32.062 --> 31:35.917
Si, como eight or nine
others I never see before,

31:36.065 --> 31:37.985
but all the same to me,
you know?

31:38.134 --> 31:39.653
Narcotraficantes.

31:39.801 --> 31:42.634
Prop Joe done
sat down to the table.

31:44.305 --> 31:46.558
Oh, do tell.

31:46.707 --> 31:49.300
The worm done
came full circle.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.997
Marlo.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.332
Que?

31:54.480 --> 31:55.832
If that is what
I think it is,

31:55.981 --> 31:57.834
our little clutch of
chickens might be putting

31:57.983 --> 31:59.836
all their eggs
up in one basket.

31:59.983 --> 32:01.772
Is good?

32:01.919 --> 32:04.410
Muy bueno, baby.

32:06.256 --> 32:08.543
I know one thing--
I wouldn't walk around

32:08.691 --> 32:10.378
with it on my neck
for Walker to find.

32:10.526 --> 32:11.945
He ain't gonna find it.

32:12.094 --> 32:13.947
You crazy even
taking a chance.

32:14.095 --> 32:15.115
If he catch you with it,

32:15.263 --> 32:19.285
he gonna break more
than them fingers.

32:19.433 --> 32:21.119
Man, what up with you?

32:21.268 --> 32:23.955
It's like lately
you gone all...

32:24.103 --> 32:25.791
Iike taking off
the mask, yo.

32:25.938 --> 32:28.526
What up with that?
If Walker got a look--

32:28.674 --> 32:30.861
He didn't.

32:31.009 --> 32:32.495
Well, what about the thing
with you and Randy?

32:32.643 --> 32:34.563
Everybody now is sayin'
you threw down with him.

32:34.712 --> 32:36.231
Busted up the boy
Dimples, and them.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.367
Yo, you wouldn't
have stood tall?

32:37.514 --> 32:38.667
That's not what I'm saying.

32:38.815 --> 32:41.570
It's not that you do shit,
It's how you do it.

32:41.717 --> 32:44.072
Yo, look, I'm not
trying to stand around

32:44.220 --> 32:47.808
and let no chump-ass
niggers think I'm shook.

32:47.956 --> 32:49.787
I ain't.

32:58.965 --> 32:59.950
And?

33:00.099 --> 33:02.589
And I want you to sign up.

33:08.672 --> 33:11.693
Colonel,
there's the matter of--

33:11.841 --> 33:13.261
You find
yourself incompatible

33:13.409 --> 33:14.995
with a certain lieutenant?

33:15.144 --> 33:16.497
Detective Freamon,

33:16.645 --> 33:18.933
you have carte blanche
in picking your squad.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.572
In fact, you can pick your
supervisor for all I care.

33:30.756 --> 33:32.276
Motherfucker,
as far as I'm concerned,

33:32.424 --> 33:35.613
you are the Major
Crimes Unit.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.714
It's morning
in Baltimore, Lester.

33:37.862 --> 33:40.797
Wake up and smell the coffee.

33:44.433 --> 33:46.521
Reinforcements?

33:46.669 --> 33:48.423
Carver.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.524
Damn, boy, what brings you
back to the plantation?

33:50.673 --> 33:53.293
I trusted you. Trusted Daniels.
My fucking mistake, huh?

33:53.441 --> 33:55.361
Whoa, hold up.
What's wrong?

33:55.510 --> 33:56.829
The kid you were
supposed to protect,

33:56.977 --> 33:58.064
you put his
name on the street.

33:58.212 --> 33:59.898
They were beating him in
front of the school today,

34:00.046 --> 34:01.566
stomping on him
for snitching.

34:01.714 --> 34:03.168
- Jesus. He all right?
- It's always the same.

34:03.315 --> 34:04.736
I should have fucking
seen this coming.

34:04.883 --> 34:06.237
I swear to you,
I don't know what happened.

34:06.385 --> 34:08.071
I hooked the kid into
Bunk Moreland and Herc.

34:08.219 --> 34:10.907
I can't believe--

34:11.054 --> 34:11.940
where's the kid now?

34:12.089 --> 34:13.743
Home.

34:13.889 --> 34:15.344
Let me go give this
to the night commander.

34:15.492 --> 34:17.079
We'll park a plainclothes
unit on the house.

34:17.226 --> 34:18.447
You think that
makes it better?

34:18.594 --> 34:20.748
We'll be discreet, set up down
the block or some shit.

34:20.896 --> 34:22.617
Come on inside.
I swear to you--

34:22.764 --> 34:24.960
I'm gonna find out
what happened.

35:45.297 --> 35:46.917
- Ed Bowers.
- Pleasure to meet you.

35:47.064 --> 35:47.951
You surprised us all.

35:48.099 --> 35:49.953
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
- Thanks.

35:50.101 --> 35:51.553
I'd like to introduce
you to Dorothy.

35:51.702 --> 35:53.355
You heard about Ed Nully?

35:53.503 --> 35:55.524
I've heard great things about what
you've been doing, so keep it up.

35:55.671 --> 35:56.758
I'm delighted you made it,
Mr. Mayor.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.759
Well, it's for
a good cause, right?

35:58.907 --> 35:59.927
I am getting
the evil eye, however.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.529
I gotta keep him circulating.

36:01.676 --> 36:02.862
Okay.
This way.

36:03.010 --> 36:05.001
- See you later.
- Take care.

36:24.128 --> 36:26.882
The Washington crowd is driving
the local real estate market now,

36:27.029 --> 36:28.450
and if the harbor promenade

36:28.598 --> 36:30.051
could extend
to the south branch--

36:30.198 --> 36:32.053
- We're looking at that.
- Should be.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.954
Everything from here
to Hanover Street is money.

36:34.102 --> 36:35.522
Mr. Mayor,
play a little poker?

36:35.669 --> 36:37.056
I'm not very lucky.

36:37.204 --> 36:38.558
Luck can change.

36:38.706 --> 36:40.059
Mr. Mayor, I'd like you
to meet Ray Chandler.

36:40.206 --> 36:42.197
Pleasure to meet you.

37:10.931 --> 37:15.026
Boy, either you gonna do it,
or I'm gonna.

37:16.836 --> 37:20.704
There's a reason the police
keep jumping out on you, Na'.

37:23.175 --> 37:26.696
So, was it the Bunk's
cologne, huh?

37:26.844 --> 37:29.198
Oh...
pussy.

37:29.346 --> 37:30.699
I'm gonna miss you,
too, bitch.

37:30.847 --> 37:32.701
Lester do love listening
to other people's

37:32.849 --> 37:35.536
phone calls, don't you?
A bit of a pervert that way.

37:35.684 --> 37:37.737
You could use
a wiretap case or two--

37:37.886 --> 37:38.873
broaden your horizons.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.541
Oh, no no.

37:40.688 --> 37:44.176
The Bunk is strictly
a suit-and-tie motherfucker.

37:44.325 --> 37:46.879
At all hazards, a man
must keep up appearances.

37:47.027 --> 37:49.047
Dignity, I say.
Dignity above all,

37:49.196 --> 37:50.548
Governor. Hear, hear!

37:50.696 --> 37:53.017
Bunk,
you got a minute?

37:53.164 --> 37:54.051
What's up?

37:54.200 --> 37:55.218
The Wagstaff kid
I sent your way.

37:55.366 --> 37:56.919
Wagstaff?
He one of mine?

37:57.068 --> 37:58.388
Yeah, you were looking
for the boy Lex,

37:58.535 --> 38:01.824
shot someone outside a nightclub
a couple of three months back.

38:01.972 --> 38:03.992
This kid knew about
Lex getting killed.

38:04.141 --> 38:05.827
Herc brought him to you.

38:05.975 --> 38:07.943
Herc?

38:09.345 --> 38:10.497
This kid is a witness,
and Herc was supposed

38:10.646 --> 38:12.733
- to bring him to me?
- That was the plan.

38:12.881 --> 38:14.677
I'm gonna skin
that motherfucker.

38:17.717 --> 38:21.340
Jesus, Herc.
The fuck did you do?

38:21.488 --> 38:23.648
Something happen to that boy?

38:24.757 --> 38:26.444
Well, young man,
your wish has come true.

38:26.592 --> 38:28.345
So this mean I can
finally get out of here?

38:28.494 --> 38:31.314
Yes, Monnel, paperwork was slow
coming in from North Avenue,

38:31.462 --> 38:32.716
but you five
are at the age

38:32.863 --> 38:34.149
where we feel
it's to your advantage

38:34.298 --> 38:36.719
to join your peers
in the ninth grade.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.454
Yo, we in high school!

38:38.601 --> 38:40.188
- When we bump?
- The end of this marking period.

38:40.336 --> 38:41.823
Congratulations.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.665
You're excused.

38:45.507 --> 38:48.194
Mr. Johnson, you have a visitor
in the front office.

38:48.343 --> 38:51.597
Mr. Johnson, please come
down to the front office.

38:51.745 --> 38:52.865
Bad news?

38:53.012 --> 38:54.699
Plenty more to go around.

38:54.848 --> 38:57.838
They pulled the pin
on your program.

39:02.020 --> 39:04.807
As I've been saying
this week at every roll call

39:04.955 --> 39:08.076
in every damn district, if I could
scrape together any more, I would.

39:08.225 --> 39:10.911
But for starters, it's a
5% salary year, and that's a given.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.714
I know it's not half
what you deserve,

39:12.861 --> 39:16.023
but if the revenue estimates stay good,
I promise you'll be seeing more.

39:18.966 --> 39:20.253
Mr. Mayor,

39:20.401 --> 39:22.454
my wife thanks you,
my children thank you,

39:22.603 --> 39:24.623
my dog thanks you.

39:24.771 --> 39:26.924
Hey, Santy, how you able to
tell your wife from your mutt?

39:27.073 --> 39:29.026
His wife, she's the one
that's got the fleas.

39:29.174 --> 39:31.162
Shit, Bobby,
with your old lady,

39:31.310 --> 39:32.696
fleas would
be an improvement.

39:32.845 --> 39:35.098
At ease. We got the mayor
here, gentlemen.

39:35.246 --> 39:37.633
When they sit in one place
too long they get a little feisty.

39:37.781 --> 39:40.436
I'm not going to stand here and
pretend I know how to do your job.

39:40.584 --> 39:43.405
I don't. But what I can tell you
is that during the past few weeks

39:43.553 --> 39:45.173
I have spoken with
many of your peers,

39:45.321 --> 39:48.008
with your union reps, with
the representatives of the FOP,

39:48.156 --> 39:50.377
and the biggest single
complaint I'm hearing

39:50.525 --> 39:52.678
concerns the department's
obsession with stats.

39:52.826 --> 39:54.180
The fucking numbers game.

39:54.328 --> 39:56.616
Well, under my watch
the numbers game is over.

39:56.763 --> 39:59.017
You will no longer be under
the gun to meet monthly quotas

39:59.165 --> 40:02.053
of ineffective, meaningless
arrests and citations.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.021
Thank you.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.824
Excuse me, Your Worship.
You're not the first person

40:06.971 --> 40:09.124
who stood at the podium
making promises.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.193
Jimmy, I'm sure the mayor
has some pressing business.

40:11.342 --> 40:12.528
No, I'm just saying,
the first community activist

40:12.676 --> 40:14.062
who pitches a bitch about
the corner activity

40:14.210 --> 40:15.530
in her neighborhood,

40:15.679 --> 40:17.598
aren't we gonna go right back
to rounding up bodies?

40:17.747 --> 40:19.600
Yeah, well, we need to educate
our citizens to the new approach.

40:19.747 --> 40:21.536
Well, they're not the only
ones who need educating.

40:21.683 --> 40:24.413
We got bosses that wouldn't know
police work if it bit 'em in the ass.

40:25.586 --> 40:27.573
They been juking stats for years,
and they'll do it again

40:27.721 --> 40:29.375
once the neighborhoods complain.
It's all they know.

40:29.523 --> 40:31.042
Well, if the old dogs
can't get the job done,

40:31.191 --> 40:33.158
I'll find new ones who can.

40:35.361 --> 40:37.181
Look, for years I sat on
the back bench of the council

40:37.329 --> 40:39.149
and watched our city
deteriorate.

40:39.297 --> 40:41.551
It was business as usual
with the same old ideas

40:41.700 --> 40:43.453
producing the same
old results.

40:43.601 --> 40:45.888
Well, I'm here now, as you are,
and I'm asking you

40:46.035 --> 40:49.162
to put aside your reservations
and give it a go.

40:52.574 --> 40:54.166
All told.

40:55.876 --> 40:57.197
You did good.

40:57.345 --> 40:59.064
You got 'em pumped.
They love you.

40:59.213 --> 41:01.333
Of course, the wrong
decision on Sergeant Hauk,

41:01.481 --> 41:03.312
and who knows?

41:05.851 --> 41:09.005
Carv said the kid had something
on it. I talked to him.

41:09.154 --> 41:11.308
He had nothing,
just a bunch of hearsay

41:11.456 --> 41:12.642
and some shit about zombies.

41:12.790 --> 41:14.176
The boy was
to come to me.

41:14.325 --> 41:16.345
You know the goddamn GO--
it's Homicide's call.

41:16.493 --> 41:18.980
You don't go putting your paws
in my murder, you simple fuck.

41:19.129 --> 41:20.483
Hey! You're talking
to a sergeant.

41:20.630 --> 41:21.850
Oh, fuck your fucking stripes!

41:21.998 --> 41:23.284
Whoa whoa,
take it easy, Bunk.

41:23.431 --> 41:25.185
Now Herc is trying
to help us here.

41:25.333 --> 41:26.954
Man, he messed
in my murder, he pays.

41:27.102 --> 41:29.555
Give him a chance.
We can work something out.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.357
That's easy for you to say.
You ain't the primary on this.

41:32.506 --> 41:34.838
Motherfucker...

41:38.244 --> 41:40.231
What got into him?

41:40.379 --> 41:41.631
He's emotional.

41:41.780 --> 41:44.009
He's been working this case
for a long time.

41:45.850 --> 41:47.537
So the thing right now
is for you to remember

41:47.685 --> 41:49.371
everything
you did on this case...

41:49.520 --> 41:51.783
from the beginning.

42:03.130 --> 42:06.485
He's out there,
hat in hand, literally.

42:06.632 --> 42:08.253
Well, he can wait
till hell freezes over.

42:08.402 --> 42:11.256
A wise man does not
burn his bridges

42:11.403 --> 42:14.024
until he first knows
he can part the waters.

42:14.172 --> 42:15.325
Old Ashanti saying.

42:15.473 --> 42:17.134
Norman, you grew up
in Catonsville.

42:20.978 --> 42:23.139
Show the motherfucker in.

42:32.219 --> 42:33.606
Mr. Mayor,

42:33.755 --> 42:37.109
I don't want to take time
out of your busy schedule.

42:37.258 --> 42:40.545
Look, if this is about me countermanding
your orders for more arrests--

42:40.694 --> 42:43.948
No, sir. You should proceed
as you feel the situation warrants.

42:44.096 --> 42:47.552
Overall, policing strategies
may not be my strongest suit.

42:47.699 --> 42:50.086
I'm here about
what I do know.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.622
A recommendation from
Sergeant Hauk's commander

42:52.769 --> 42:54.723
will cross your
desk tomorrow.

42:54.871 --> 42:56.792
Colonel Daniels,
with Rawls concurring,

42:56.939 --> 43:00.061
recommends sensitivity
training.

43:00.209 --> 43:02.095
It may be
a fair decision,

43:02.244 --> 43:04.665
it may even be
the right decision.

43:04.813 --> 43:07.567
But we both know it won't
fly with the ministers,

43:07.716 --> 43:09.969
not even with
Daniels behind it.

43:10.117 --> 43:11.606
Hmm.

43:15.621 --> 43:17.841
600 pages of rules,

43:17.989 --> 43:20.582
regulations,
directives, orders.

43:23.961 --> 43:26.816
You fire a white police
for a bad car stop

43:26.963 --> 43:30.085
on a black minister, you'll
lose the rank and file.

43:30.233 --> 43:33.487
It's not cause enough.
But if a commander can't find

43:33.635 --> 43:36.832
grounds for firing
a saint in here...

43:38.440 --> 43:41.493
The man has worked
Narcotics for six years,

43:41.642 --> 43:46.332
and in Narcotics
there are no virgins.

43:46.479 --> 43:48.333
And herein lies
your expertise?

43:48.481 --> 43:50.301
Hmm.

43:50.449 --> 43:54.204
I've always been comfortable
delegating strategic elements.

43:54.352 --> 43:56.340
It's what
the Deputy Ops is for.

43:56.487 --> 44:00.184
Me, I know what
a mayor needs.

44:03.126 --> 44:04.778
- It was a Chevy Tahoe.
- Mm-hmm.

44:04.927 --> 44:09.283
License Mike-460-654.

44:09.431 --> 44:12.452
And I searched it good,
figuring I'd find some iron, but--

44:12.600 --> 44:13.620
How'd they react?

44:13.768 --> 44:15.988
Chris and Snoop?
They didn't do shit.

44:16.137 --> 44:17.422
Was there anything
in the car?

44:17.570 --> 44:19.790
Registration and crap
in the glove box,

44:19.939 --> 44:22.526
empty chicken boxes, trash.

44:22.674 --> 44:24.829
They had one of those
plastic milk crates--

44:24.976 --> 44:25.962
Mm-hmm.

44:26.111 --> 44:27.564
--in the back with
some tools in it.

44:27.712 --> 44:28.598
What kind of tools?

44:28.745 --> 44:30.266
I don't know,
carpenter tools.

44:30.413 --> 44:32.134
Did you check the crate
for weapons?

44:32.282 --> 44:33.636
Nail gun.

44:33.784 --> 44:35.037
Nail gun?

44:35.184 --> 44:36.537
Yeah, one of them bitches
that shoots nails.

44:36.686 --> 44:37.805
They rig it to shoot
rounds maybe?

44:37.953 --> 44:41.115
Naw, I shot it.
A nail came out.

44:43.124 --> 44:45.478
Look, Lester, seriously,
is any of this helping?

44:45.627 --> 44:48.147
Naw, you're doing good.

44:48.294 --> 44:51.957
Tell me about jacking Marlo
at the train station.

45:02.239 --> 45:03.760
I'm short four, right?

45:03.908 --> 45:06.094
Yeah,
I remember your ass.

45:06.242 --> 45:07.963
Here's my four.
You like that?

45:08.110 --> 45:09.430
- Okay!
- I'm gonna beat your ass.

45:09.579 --> 45:10.599
Okay, no more!
Stop stop stop stop.

45:10.746 --> 45:12.099
Take the money,
take the money, all right?

45:12.247 --> 45:14.234
Stop.

45:14.383 --> 45:15.702
Make me work
this hard again,

45:15.850 --> 45:16.936
I'm gonna
skin one of y'all!

45:17.084 --> 45:20.416
Okay. Just go, man.

45:22.255 --> 45:25.553
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

45:27.059 --> 45:29.781
You know who got the fattest
asses and the best pussy?

45:29.928 --> 45:31.782
- Who that?
- Midgets, nigger.

45:31.930 --> 45:33.760
They're all that,
you know what I'm saying?

45:35.934 --> 45:37.987
The fuck happened
to our boy on the door?

45:38.135 --> 45:40.355
Siesta, Papa.

45:40.503 --> 45:42.937
You fix this, Joe?

45:47.342 --> 45:49.396
What's the problem?

45:49.543 --> 45:51.297
Ran out of time.

45:51.445 --> 45:53.298
Now, Joe, you've been
so busy being devious,

45:53.447 --> 45:56.001
you done messed around and got
yourself caught up in a web.

45:56.149 --> 45:58.003
Omar, I don't know what
you been hearing, now--

45:58.150 --> 45:59.304
Joe, ain't no time
for no lies now.

45:59.451 --> 46:00.938
Now see, I need you
to be straight,

46:01.086 --> 46:03.741
just like you did on that
New Day Co-op sit down.

46:03.888 --> 46:06.076
Oh, yeah,
I know about that.

46:06.224 --> 46:08.410
I know you the one got Marlo
up in this mess too.

46:08.559 --> 46:11.013
Hey, Omar,
take a deep breath.

46:11.161 --> 46:14.182
A proposition might fall
kindly on your ear.

46:14.331 --> 46:15.950
Well, tickle my fancy,
fat man.

46:16.098 --> 46:18.251
Money, drugs-- your call.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.753
Come on, now, Joe,
you can do better than that.

46:19.901 --> 46:22.088
Hey, we-- we coming
at this all wrong.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.623
See, you the one
with the high card.

46:23.770 --> 46:25.761
You should speak your mind.

46:27.741 --> 46:30.595
You going to serve up Marlo.

46:30.743 --> 46:32.297
You gonna take out
Marlo Stanfield?

46:32.445 --> 46:35.232
No no, but I got
a real powerful urge

46:35.380 --> 46:37.367
to take everything he owns,

46:37.514 --> 46:40.002
and I'm quite confident you
the man can make that happen.

46:40.150 --> 46:41.437
That might take some doing.

46:41.584 --> 46:43.439
Naw naw, see,
we got to have it simple.

46:43.586 --> 46:46.308
See, Omar like it simple.

46:46.455 --> 46:48.776
So how we gonna
do this, yo?

46:48.925 --> 46:51.445
Huh?

46:51.592 --> 46:53.113
My sister's boy.

46:53.261 --> 46:54.781
He do the drop.

46:54.929 --> 46:59.451
We call you
and give up the spot.

46:59.599 --> 47:01.886
- That simple enough?
- That's what it is.

47:02.035 --> 47:05.089
See now, Joe, I need you to
resist your natural inclination

47:05.237 --> 47:08.291
to do anything twisted up
in this here play. You feel me?

47:08.440 --> 47:10.793
I even catch a whiff of you
doing something foul, Joe,

47:10.942 --> 47:13.696
I mean, I might got to go
tell Marlo you the one

47:13.844 --> 47:17.366
put me up on that card game.

47:17.513 --> 47:19.300
We understood?

47:19.448 --> 47:23.440
Now go ahead and write
my ticket so I can tip on out.

47:24.853 --> 47:27.082
Come on now.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.052
Gentlemen.

47:48.705 --> 47:50.424
I'll see to Tremaine.

47:50.573 --> 47:53.427
- You can't be serious.
- Was you listening?

47:53.575 --> 47:55.763
Omar to one side
holding a spade,

47:55.910 --> 47:59.599
and maybe Marlo
to the other with a shovel.

47:59.746 --> 48:01.700
And just at this moment,

48:01.849 --> 48:05.870
I managed to crawl out
my own damn grave.

48:06.019 --> 48:09.009
No way do I crawl back in.

48:10.156 --> 48:12.442
What the fuck was
you doing out here, man?

48:12.590 --> 48:13.777
You trust him?

48:13.925 --> 48:16.879
- I trust his fear.
- Now we go, si?

48:17.027 --> 48:20.690
Not till I teach Prop Joe
a thing or two about devious.

48:22.031 --> 48:23.692
We on him now.

48:27.936 --> 48:30.223
Sorry, guys, that's all
I got to say. Talk to the mom.

48:30.372 --> 48:33.893
I hear you, but we just came
from his foster mother's house,

48:34.041 --> 48:36.728
and she said it was you
that told him not to talk.

48:36.876 --> 48:38.397
She said you told her
to get a lawyer.

48:38.545 --> 48:40.232
That's right.

48:40.379 --> 48:42.900
All right, look,
something got messed up.

48:43.048 --> 48:45.235
We know that,
but whatever else happened,

48:45.384 --> 48:46.436
we got a murder here.

48:46.584 --> 48:47.571
Even if it's off the record,

48:47.718 --> 48:49.139
it would help us
just to talk to the boy.

48:49.287 --> 48:51.240
If you understand
what happened here,

48:51.388 --> 48:53.909
you know I'm not
gonna do that.

48:54.057 --> 48:56.444
If you go at it like that,
then you end up

48:56.592 --> 48:58.580
siding with the motherfuckers
doing the dirt.

48:58.728 --> 49:01.560
No, I'm siding
with my kids.

49:05.065 --> 49:08.354
You're right.
You're right.

49:08.502 --> 49:12.524
For you,
the kids come first.

49:12.672 --> 49:14.662
We'll find another road.

49:18.343 --> 49:22.176
Well, glad this
is working out for you.

49:24.014 --> 49:26.201
Oh, man, you two...

49:26.349 --> 49:29.010
makin' me all
weepy and shit.

49:30.519 --> 49:31.706
Be safe, guys.

49:31.854 --> 49:32.840
All right.

49:32.988 --> 49:34.474
Hey, Roland, man,

49:34.622 --> 49:37.710
you know, I hate
coming all this way

49:37.859 --> 49:40.379
and not getting
a little something...

49:40.528 --> 49:42.858
you know,
for old times' sake?

49:48.434 --> 49:50.621
The playground behind
Fulton and Monroe,

49:50.770 --> 49:53.389
unit block.

49:53.538 --> 49:57.233
He told this fella Lex
to meet a girl there.

49:59.676 --> 50:01.665
That's all he did.

50:15.555 --> 50:17.489
What's up, Shorty?
Can you give me three?

50:21.893 --> 50:23.914
Bitch, get the fuck
across the street

50:24.063 --> 50:25.916
and plant your ass
on a stoop.

50:26.064 --> 50:27.861
Kenard!

50:29.399 --> 50:31.387
Yo, how do you think I look
with no tail on my head?

50:31.535 --> 50:33.421
Do I look like a faggy?

50:33.569 --> 50:35.560
Yo, Na'.

50:43.244 --> 50:45.097
Yo, Mrs. Lee,
you looking for Michael?

50:45.245 --> 50:48.099
Um, Namond, I don't want
to be no trouble to you,

50:48.247 --> 50:49.935
but I got this friend
who been ailing,

50:50.083 --> 50:52.437
you know,
and she gave me $6.

50:52.584 --> 50:55.348
So I was hoping you
could, you know...

50:58.756 --> 51:03.211
Yeah, we cover her.
Go see my man.

51:03.359 --> 51:05.046
The fuck you do that for?

51:05.195 --> 51:07.014
It's Michael's moms, yo.

51:07.163 --> 51:08.550
Shit, she
a fucking dope fiend.

51:08.697 --> 51:10.216
Namond said I could. Na'?

51:10.365 --> 51:11.551
Naw, it's cool.

51:11.700 --> 51:13.119
Gimme Yellow Bird.

51:13.267 --> 51:15.522
All right, but you ain't
got to be all up on me.

51:15.669 --> 51:18.223
I know, I know!
I'm late, you know?

51:18.371 --> 51:22.534
Sometimes it's just too much
damn fun being in charge.

51:29.881 --> 51:31.067
Where you been, boss?

51:31.216 --> 51:32.569
Announcing my presence
with authority.

51:32.716 --> 51:35.378
Sorry I'm late.
Please sit down. Sit.

51:37.054 --> 51:38.740
Sir, we scarfed up
52 vehicles.

51:38.888 --> 51:40.219
Good.
But you missed my car.

51:41.389 --> 51:43.744
We have new equipment
at school 45,

51:43.892 --> 51:46.079
school 52, and school 58
installed.

51:46.228 --> 51:49.749
Well, I got no calls on those, but keep
at it. You'll get there, I'm sure.

51:49.896 --> 51:53.085
Mr. Mayor, all hydrants
are fully capped as of today,

51:53.233 --> 51:55.487
and solid waste has
pulled 32 tons of trash

51:55.634 --> 51:57.755
from the alleys, and, sir,
that's a single-day record.

51:57.903 --> 51:59.256
That's what I want to hear.

51:59.404 --> 52:02.463
Thank you, gentlemen,
and keep up the good work.

52:04.542 --> 52:05.795
Finance, of course,
doesn't deal with

52:05.942 --> 52:08.864
the dirt-under-
the-nails tangibles,

52:09.012 --> 52:12.200
unless you consider the money
itself to be dirty.

52:12.348 --> 52:14.736
- So what's in your agenda today?
- The school audit.

52:14.883 --> 52:16.004
Well, how bad could that be?

52:16.151 --> 52:18.675
The system is running
a $54 million deficit.

52:21.222 --> 52:22.742
54 million?

52:22.890 --> 52:25.378
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

52:25.525 --> 52:29.047
Jesus Christ.
Did Royce know this?

52:29.195 --> 52:31.749
How the fuck do we
deal with that?

52:31.897 --> 52:34.729
Frankly, I'm not
sure just yet.

52:39.936 --> 52:41.057
Our attendance is excellent,

52:41.204 --> 52:44.126
and as to suspensions,
we don't have any.

52:44.274 --> 52:45.393
We intervene immediately,

52:45.542 --> 52:47.395
and we show success
in stabilizing behavior.

52:47.543 --> 52:49.230
Not to mention the world of good
we're doing for the classes

52:49.378 --> 52:51.398
these kids were wrecking
before the program.

52:51.546 --> 52:53.899
In January we could
expand to four classes,

52:54.048 --> 52:55.402
cover the whole eighth grade.

52:55.549 --> 52:56.902
Any complaints about
the tracking,

52:57.050 --> 52:58.703
- anything from the parents?
- Not a one.

52:58.852 --> 53:01.339
This isn't a group where we see
a lot of parental intervention.

53:01.487 --> 53:02.539
What about test scores?

53:02.688 --> 53:04.274
I can't speak to
the program itself,

53:04.423 --> 53:06.810
but it has to help
the rest of the eighth grade.

53:06.958 --> 53:08.948
Next week will tell.

53:12.329 --> 53:14.617
Right now the system

53:14.764 --> 53:16.518
is under a lot of scrutiny.

53:16.666 --> 53:20.187
We have certain fiscal issues
that are of great concern

53:20.335 --> 53:23.524
to the new administration,
and what you're proposing here

53:23.671 --> 53:26.426
is a radical shift
in curricula.

53:26.574 --> 53:28.027
Meaning?

53:28.174 --> 53:29.996
If City Hall were
to sign off on this,

53:30.143 --> 53:31.263
we could go forward,

53:31.411 --> 53:34.199
but now
is not the time

53:34.346 --> 53:37.338
to rock any boats.

53:47.524 --> 53:49.583
Hear that?
That's my joint right there.

53:55.029 --> 53:56.883
So you all got your
work up to date, right?

53:57.030 --> 53:59.552
Yeah
yeah yeah.

53:59.700 --> 54:01.353
I heard you took care
of your puppy's problems.

54:01.501 --> 54:05.824
Oh, he most definitely made
that go away, you hear me?

54:05.972 --> 54:06.991
It's all good.

54:07.139 --> 54:09.326
You know, some of
the young'uns been saying

54:09.474 --> 54:11.601
your pup stood tall
with a snitchin' boy.

54:13.077 --> 54:14.497
Michael?

54:14.645 --> 54:16.164
Yeah, that's what
they saying.

54:16.313 --> 54:19.975
- Huh.
- Yeah.

55:51.823 --> 55:54.483
Lester, you really starting
to scare me, man.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.708
- Need a crowbar.
- For what?

56:33.855 --> 56:36.643
This is a tomb.

56:36.791 --> 56:38.418
Lex is in there.

57:12.919 --> 57:16.075
Oh...

57:16.223 --> 57:18.214
fuck me.
