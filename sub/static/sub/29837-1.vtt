[banging on door]

03:20.717 --> 03:22.132
- A moment, please.

03:23.341 --> 03:24.204
Damn you.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.870
- Were you sleeping?

03:35.905 --> 03:37.389
- Jesus, what's going on here?

03:52.715 --> 03:54.268
Sorry, I fell asleep.

03:56.443 --> 03:58.099
- What the fuck is in this?

03:59.031 --> 04:00.032
This coffee's shite.

04:01.344 --> 04:02.759
- What's wrong with it?

04:02.794 --> 04:04.209
- Why don't you taste it?

04:05.486 --> 04:07.143
Seriously, you wanna poison me?

04:09.179 --> 04:12.286
So, what did you end
up deciding in the end?

04:12.321 --> 04:13.874
- I've accepted the assignment.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.083
- Really?

04:16.117 --> 04:17.740
You wanna go all
the way up there?

04:18.913 --> 04:20.570
You really think
it's a good idea?

04:20.605 --> 04:21.606
And your nightmare--

04:21.640 --> 04:24.194
- Hey, I'm fine now, okay?

04:24.229 --> 04:25.541
I just had a lot going on.

04:26.921 --> 04:28.268
- Still.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.028
I don't think it's a good idea.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.651
If I were you, I'd
just take a break.

04:32.686 --> 04:35.689
- I really wanna make some
life changes, don't you get it?

04:35.723 --> 04:38.554
It's just a chance to step up
and get promoted, that's all.

04:38.588 --> 04:39.417
Believe me.

04:40.901 --> 04:42.627
I really wanna move out of here.

04:44.007 --> 04:45.423
- Why?

04:45.457 --> 04:46.941
What's wrong with this place?

04:49.703 --> 04:52.430
- It's getting late, I
must head to the office.

[light eerie music]

05:07.099 --> 05:09.136
Hi, can you tell me
where I can find Ann?

05:10.206 --> 05:11.345
Hey, wake up!

05:11.380 --> 05:12.242
You seen her?

05:13.382 --> 05:14.555
Okay, got it.

05:14.590 --> 05:15.556
Where has she gone?

05:16.971 --> 05:18.179
Tell her I'm looking for her.

05:18.214 --> 05:19.871
- Okay.
- Tell her!

05:19.905 --> 05:20.734
- Okay.

05:27.982 --> 05:29.881
- Repeater's out of commission.

05:29.915 --> 05:32.228
Could've been a
lightning strike.

05:32.262 --> 05:33.781
- Nah man, it's the software.

05:33.816 --> 05:36.094
- Yeah, I hope so, otherwise
we'll have to go back

05:36.128 --> 05:38.268
and replace the
entire power line.

05:39.235 --> 05:41.444
Still, better to be optimistic

05:41.479 --> 05:43.929
when the going gets tough, eh?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.726
Who designed the
software anyway?

05:47.761 --> 05:48.969
- The Dynamic Group?

05:49.003 --> 05:50.177
Dynamic Group.

05:51.558 --> 05:52.835
- Dynamic shit.

05:56.079 --> 05:57.253
Move your hand.

05:57.287 --> 05:58.772
It'll be a right laugh
if we have to stay

05:58.806 --> 06:00.394
out there for God
knows how long.

06:02.258 --> 06:04.502

[light eerie music]

06:23.210 --> 06:24.107
- May I?

06:24.142 --> 06:25.281
- What do you want, Robert?

06:25.315 --> 06:26.386
I'm rather swamped.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.423
- Ready to leave?

06:29.458 --> 06:31.908
- Yeah, I'm just
collecting some things.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.185
- As I mentioned,
you'll have to take

06:33.220 --> 06:35.464
everything you need with
you to spend the night--

06:35.498 --> 06:36.741
- There won't be
any need for that.

06:36.775 --> 06:38.156
If it's what I think it is,

06:38.190 --> 06:39.985
I'll just have to reinstall
the operating system

06:40.020 --> 06:41.677
and realign the parables.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.680
- The repeater shows
no signs of life,

06:44.714 --> 06:46.406
you couldn't even
reach it online.

06:51.031 --> 06:53.240
Listen, about us, are you sure--

06:53.274 --> 06:54.862
- We already talked about that.

06:54.897 --> 06:56.312
There's nothing more to add.

06:57.244 --> 06:58.556
Close the door when you go.

06:59.591 --> 07:01.524
Oh, there you are at last.

07:01.559 --> 07:02.870
Do you mind telling
me where you were?

07:02.905 --> 07:04.354
- I was downstairs.

07:04.389 --> 07:05.252
What do you want?

07:11.189 --> 07:11.983
Bye bye, Robert.

07:19.577 --> 07:21.958
What was he doing
in your office?

07:21.993 --> 07:23.650
Have you or have you not
broken it off with him?

07:23.684 --> 07:25.237
- Of course.

07:25.272 --> 07:27.101
He just has to come
to terms with it.

07:27.136 --> 07:29.000
- Hey, it's good to
have you with us.

07:29.034 --> 07:32.486
So, they make you and me
do the dirty jobs, huh?

07:39.528 --> 07:41.150
- Hey, question.

07:41.184 --> 07:42.634
What the hell is going on here?

07:42.669 --> 07:44.843
Are we gonna have to stay
out of there all night?

07:46.017 --> 07:47.915
I'm gonna fix the
damn repeater fast.

07:47.950 --> 07:48.882
All right, boss?

07:48.916 --> 07:49.986
- Shut up, Mike.

07:52.610 --> 07:54.646
- Hey guys, look!

07:54.681 --> 07:56.303
Woop!

07:56.337 --> 07:57.338
- [Ann] Oh my god!

07:57.373 --> 07:59.168
- This is for the mission.

07:59.202 --> 08:01.584
Pure analog sound.

08:01.619 --> 08:02.827
- What is that?

08:02.861 --> 08:05.795
- Amigo, this is the
ultimate in cool.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.729
- The ultimate in cool.

08:08.764 --> 08:11.352
You're telling me that that
antique actually works?

- Hey.

08:19.153 --> 08:20.776
- Oh, turn it down, will ya?

08:22.225 --> 08:25.988
When that music was popular
you weren't even born yet.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.092
Go.

08:27.127 --> 08:28.335
- Well, I think it's great.

08:28.369 --> 08:29.716
Where in the hell
did you find it?

08:29.750 --> 08:32.822
[speaking foreign language]

08:32.857 --> 08:34.479
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.688
This is awkward to start.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.522
Turn that down!

08:42.556 --> 08:43.557
- SeÃ±or.

08:43.592 --> 08:44.834
- Turn it down!

08:55.327 --> 08:56.881
What are you?

10:14.372 --> 10:16.305

help with the unloading.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.135
- [Mike] Come on, man.

10:19.170 --> 10:21.172
Sick and tired of this already.

10:22.552 --> 10:24.209
- We are gonna end
up getting lost.

10:24.244 --> 10:25.555
- I'm not getting any coverage.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.971
- Yeah, that'll be the repeater.

10:27.005 --> 10:29.180
- [Phil] Hey, do you
guys have any saltines?

10:30.284 --> 10:32.217
I ate too much sugary
crap on the way.

10:32.252 --> 10:33.598
- [Mike] I swear,
when I get back

10:33.633 --> 10:35.324
I'm demanding a fucking raise.

10:35.358 --> 10:38.051
Jesus Christ, what a shitty job.

10:38.085 --> 10:39.397
- Hey man, don't complain.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.640
I make half your
salary and I gotta

10:40.674 --> 10:42.262
bust my ass twice as hard.

10:42.296 --> 10:44.367
- [Mike] Yeah, how
about giving it a rest.

10:45.334 --> 10:46.335
- It's just that
I don't squander

10:46.369 --> 10:49.096
my entire salary on video poker.

10:49.131 --> 10:50.822
A serious lack of what's up.

10:50.857 --> 10:51.651
- Mate.

10:52.721 --> 10:54.446
You are getting on my nerves.

10:54.481 --> 10:56.103
- Hey you.

10:56.138 --> 10:57.967
Leave him alone,
he's just a kid.

10:58.002 --> 10:58.796
- Kid?

11:01.005 --> 11:01.833

11:44.565 --> 11:45.325
- Why, why not?

11:50.502 --> 11:51.296
- Come on.

11:51.331 --> 11:52.125
- Smile.

11:53.057 --> 11:54.921
Nice!
- Yeah, now let me you.

11:54.955 --> 11:56.094
- Yeah, sure, take one of me.

11:56.129 --> 11:57.268
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:59.132 --> 12:00.789
- Come on!

12:00.823 --> 12:01.686

13:22.525 --> 13:24.596
When are you gonna
decide to grow up?

13:24.631 --> 13:25.701

do it on purpose!

13:25.735 --> 13:27.116
- And wanting to bring a noisy

13:27.151 --> 13:28.048
piece of junk
- What are you doing?

13:28.083 --> 13:29.498
- With you in the first place?

13:29.532 --> 13:30.637
Give me it!
- That's my radio,

13:30.671 --> 13:32.190

[dramatic music]

14:22.344 --> 14:23.448
- Differential's shot.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.451
Must've been a lightning strike.

so sure of that?

There's no line.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.363
[laughing]

14:41.397 --> 14:42.398

Um, where is you?

15:17.019 --> 15:19.539
[eerie music]

15:22.576 --> 15:26.201
Will you not, I don't
wanna be here a week.

15:26.235 --> 15:27.650
- Don't worry, Mike.

15:27.685 --> 15:29.411
Georgie's gonna
fix everything now.

15:31.309 --> 15:33.484
[beeping]

15:38.454 --> 15:40.525
- [Georgie] Why is
the SOS light on?

15:40.560 --> 15:41.768
- Because it's under--

15:41.802 --> 15:44.460
- Yeah, I don't think
she were asking you.

15:44.495 --> 15:46.980
Because it's under the low
voltage auxiliary line.

15:49.189 --> 15:49.983
- Don't look at me.

15:50.018 --> 15:52.434
I'm not going up there.

15:52.468 --> 15:57.473
You're the expert.

16:09.623 --> 16:12.454
[engine rumbling]

16:25.674 --> 16:26.778
- Son of a bitch.

16:27.607 --> 16:29.160
It's crashed.

16:29.195 --> 16:30.023
Hey, it's crashed.

16:30.058 --> 16:31.783
- My god, are you sure?

16:35.304 --> 16:38.066
- Can I get some
light here, please?

16:38.100 --> 16:39.619
I can't see shite.

16:44.865 --> 16:47.075
- Where did the plane end up?

16:47.109 --> 16:50.664
- It crashed on the other side
of that hill, I'm sure of it.

16:50.699 --> 16:51.493
- How can you say that?

16:51.527 --> 16:53.426
You can't know that.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.186
Maybe it's still flying.

16:55.221 --> 16:56.946
- I definitely heard
the sound of the impact.

16:56.981 --> 16:59.466
It wasn't loud, but--

17:00.640 --> 17:02.676
- Oh, for Christ's
sake, man, speak up!

17:02.711 --> 17:05.300
- Well, even if it wasn't
loud, it was recognizable.

17:07.128 --> 17:08.888
I'm sure of it, it
definitely crashed.

17:08.924 --> 17:09.718
- Mike's right.

17:09.752 --> 17:10.925
- I said it crashed!

17:10.960 --> 17:12.307
- In which case, what
are we doing here?

17:12.340 --> 17:13.790
Let's move.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.619
Somebody was onboard and we
don't even know if they're okay.

17:15.655 --> 17:17.208
- Yeah, let's go take a look,

17:17.242 --> 17:19.002
it might've been
carrying somebody.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.523
- Don't even think about it,
we've got work to do here.

17:22.558 --> 17:24.146
- Georgie, what are you saying?

17:24.181 --> 17:26.597
A plane just crashed,
for Christ's sake!

17:27.563 --> 17:28.806
- We need to go check it out.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.152
- [Ann] Yeah, the
repeater can wait.

17:30.187 --> 17:31.084
Come on, let's go.

17:43.579 --> 17:46.513
[dark eerie music]

18:32.456 --> 18:34.216
- Fucking door, open!

18:34.251 --> 18:36.943
Get the door open,
get me outta here!

18:36.977 --> 18:38.876
Get me outta here!

18:38.910 --> 18:41.430
Get me the fuck outta here!

18:41.465 --> 18:42.362
Get me out!

18:43.329 --> 18:44.640
- [Mike] This way!

18:44.675 --> 18:47.367
[woman crying]

18:47.402 --> 18:48.610
Come on out!

18:48.644 --> 18:50.370
- - [Matt] Open
the fucking door!

18:50.405 --> 18:51.923
- Come out!

18:51.958 --> 18:54.098
- Get me, get me the fuck out!

18:54.133 --> 18:55.272
Now!

18:55.306 --> 18:56.135
Now!

18:59.172 --> 19:00.104
Get me out!

19:01.036 --> 19:03.383
- [Mike] Christ's sake!

19:03.418 --> 19:05.454
- [Ann] Come on, I'll
take you, come here.

19:05.489 --> 19:07.456
Come here, it's okay.

19:07.491 --> 19:10.252
[woman crying]

19:10.287 --> 19:11.978
[muffled talking]

19:12.012 --> 19:12.841
- [Mike] Hey!

19:15.706 --> 19:17.190
Give me your hand!

19:20.089 --> 19:22.299
[grunting]

19:45.667 --> 19:47.220
- Everything okay?

19:47.255 --> 19:48.808
Nothing broken?

19:48.842 --> 19:50.361
- What?

19:50.396 --> 19:51.431
Yeah, I'm all right.

19:51.466 --> 19:53.882
I'm okay, I think I'm okay.

19:55.573 --> 19:56.678
- You're in one piece?

20:02.615 --> 20:03.823
Did the pilot manage
to send a mayday

20:03.857 --> 20:05.238
call and give your position?

20:06.757 --> 20:08.276
Hey, did you hear what I said?

20:11.279 --> 20:12.141
- Yeah.

20:13.004 --> 20:13.833
I think so.

20:16.525 --> 20:17.871
- What a landing.

20:17.906 --> 20:19.079
- Jack.
- We should've sent

20:19.114 --> 20:20.667
the SOS from the repeater.

20:20.702 --> 20:21.910
- Hey, guys.

20:23.325 --> 20:26.708
Who gave a license to Red
Baron in the pilot seat?

20:26.742 --> 20:28.192
- A repeater?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.642
The hell you talking about?

20:29.676 --> 20:31.264
- The repeater.

20:31.299 --> 20:34.094
The one you were heading
for into this outer hill.

20:34.129 --> 20:35.924
You missed it by half an inch.

20:38.444 --> 20:40.239
- The pilot sent the mayday.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.448
Someone will be here
soon, all right?

20:42.482 --> 20:43.276
- Jack.

20:43.311 --> 20:44.691
I wanna get out of here.

20:45.899 --> 20:47.798
Jack, get me away from here.
- Georgie.

20:47.832 --> 20:49.593
You're not going
anywhere with that.

20:50.835 --> 20:52.803
- We set up a tent, we
wait for the rescuers.

20:58.326 --> 20:59.879
- Great.

20:59.913 --> 21:02.399
Now we have to play
the fucking Red Cross.

21:06.644 --> 21:11.649
[crickets chirping]
[suspenseful music]

22:08.499 --> 22:11.053
- [Phil] Oh, let go of my
hair, you son of a bitch.

22:11.088 --> 22:13.815
- Get your finger out your
ass and those tents set up.

22:13.849 --> 22:16.611
If you haven't noticed,
the poor woman's fainting.

22:16.645 --> 22:17.439
- [Phil] Oh, you bastard.

22:17.474 --> 22:18.647
What's wrong with you?

22:18.682 --> 22:19.579
- Get a move on!

22:19.614 --> 22:20.615
- [Phil] Okay, I'm doing it.

22:26.828 --> 22:28.485
- What do you plan to do?

22:28.519 --> 22:30.556
Are the rescuers coming or not?

22:30.590 --> 22:33.144
- What do I plan to do, Ann?

22:33.179 --> 22:35.457
Since you wanted so
badly to drag your ass

22:35.492 --> 22:37.494
to the rescue, you
think of something.

22:38.426 --> 22:39.288
And fast.

22:46.434 --> 22:47.780
- Now what do you want?

22:47.814 --> 22:50.610
- Your turn to play
guard dog, Philip.

22:51.542 --> 22:53.130
- And what does a guard dog do?

22:53.164 --> 22:55.408
- I'm sleeping along
in the tent tonight.

22:55.443 --> 22:56.651
Got it?

22:56.685 --> 22:59.619
You stay out here, and
you keep an eye on them.

23:00.586 --> 23:02.139
And you keep the worms company.

23:13.253 --> 23:14.807
Hey.

23:14.841 --> 23:15.739
Charlie Lindbergh.

23:17.982 --> 23:18.811
Here's your tent!

23:22.159 --> 23:23.643
You're putting it up yourself.

23:27.060 --> 23:30.581
So, three of you taking off.

23:32.721 --> 23:33.826
Where were you headed?

23:37.485 --> 23:39.383
- Listen, asshole.

23:39.418 --> 23:43.111
No one asked you to help,
so mind your own business.

23:43.145 --> 23:44.146
Got it?

23:44.181 --> 23:46.425
[thudding]

23:50.256 --> 23:51.775
- Hello, mate.

23:51.809 --> 23:55.503
Did you know you've
got a really shit face,

23:55.537 --> 23:58.471
[speaking foreign language].

23:58.506 --> 24:00.646
Don't worry, I'll
put it up for you.

24:00.680 --> 24:01.578
Take it easy, man.

24:07.963 --> 24:10.518
- Mike, stop being a dick.

24:10.552 --> 24:12.312
Do you understand me?

24:14.073 --> 24:14.901
- I've...

24:17.801 --> 24:19.458
Just kidding around.

24:28.708 --> 24:31.470
[fire crackling]

24:35.957 --> 24:38.960
[crickets chirping]

24:59.912 --> 25:02.362
[eerie music]

26:24.859 --> 26:27.586
[dramatic music]

26:57.374 --> 27:00.032
[chiming music]

27:08.178 --> 27:09.524
- Where are you?

27:11.940 --> 27:16.945
Georgie!

27:19.776 --> 27:20.639
Georgie!

27:27.715 --> 27:29.268
And what happened to Mike?

27:29.302 --> 27:30.683
He's disappeared.

27:30.718 --> 27:32.512
What happened to you?

27:46.492 --> 27:49.495
[crickets chirping]

28:00.471 --> 28:02.784
- Hey, Alex.

28:02.819 --> 28:03.682
You awake?

28:05.062 --> 28:09.618
We're going to the plane
right now, so, see ya later.

28:13.105 --> 28:14.865
- Where you going now?

28:14.900 --> 28:16.418
- Well, Jack just wants
us to go to the plane

28:16.453 --> 28:19.042
and take a look,
get a few things.

28:22.045 --> 28:23.184
- Hey, Georgie, it's weird.

28:23.218 --> 28:24.185
Mike's disappeared.

28:25.117 --> 28:27.015
- Nothing, I couldn't find him.

28:28.672 --> 28:31.433
[dramatic music]

28:31.468 --> 28:33.194
- Hey, we're coming too.

28:33.228 --> 28:34.333
We've gotta find Mike.

28:40.028 --> 28:41.374
Mike!
- Oh, jeez.

28:42.237 --> 28:44.170
Hey, you know what time it is?

28:44.205 --> 28:44.999
- How the hell do I know?

28:45.033 --> 28:46.448
You got the watch.

28:46.483 --> 28:47.311
- [Ann] Mike?

28:50.245 --> 28:51.039
- Hey, Phil.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.180
You know what time it is?

28:54.215 --> 28:55.388
What's it like, 1800?

28:56.424 --> 28:57.252
- 1800?

28:58.944 --> 29:00.980
I think your watch took a
bad hit in that landing.

29:02.188 --> 29:04.052
It's 0900, amigo.

29:09.644 --> 29:11.819
- Hey, what the
fuck are you doing?

29:11.853 --> 29:12.854
- Easy guys, stop!

29:12.889 --> 29:14.166
I said stop!

29:14.200 --> 29:15.270
[yelling]

29:15.305 --> 29:17.100
Hey, I said stop!
- Jesus!

29:18.273 --> 29:19.378
Let go of me!

29:21.829 --> 29:22.691
Let go!

29:23.865 --> 29:26.109
- I said!
- You wanna fuck with me?

29:27.144 --> 29:28.352
Come on, then!

29:28.387 --> 29:29.181
- Come on, then!

29:29.215 --> 29:30.630
- Hey, that's enough!

29:30.665 --> 29:32.909
[thudding]

29:35.014 --> 29:37.258
[thudding]

29:38.328 --> 29:41.227
- Hey, let go of my beard!

29:41.262 --> 29:42.884
[screaming]

29:42.919 --> 29:45.611
[evil laughing]

29:46.508 --> 29:47.751
[blowing]

29:47.786 --> 29:49.857
You son of a bitch!

29:49.891 --> 29:50.961
- Cool it, man.

29:50.996 --> 29:52.825
- Get the fuck off me!

29:54.689 --> 29:55.828
- Great, Mike.

29:55.863 --> 29:57.381
You've really gone
and done it this time.

29:57.416 --> 30:00.695
- Fuck you!

30:00.729 --> 30:03.456
I don't trust these bastards.

30:03.491 --> 30:05.251
- What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

30:05.286 --> 30:06.528
Are you crazy?

30:06.563 --> 30:10.118
- I wanted to make sure
there were no surprises.

30:10.153 --> 30:12.327
I want an apology here and now.

30:12.362 --> 30:14.088
- An apology, right?

30:14.122 --> 30:15.158
You're joking, huh?

30:16.573 --> 30:19.196
- We have a right to know
who it is we're dealing with.

30:19.231 --> 30:20.991
- No, Mike, I'm
tired of your shit.

30:21.026 --> 30:22.475
This time I'm writing you up.

30:23.338 --> 30:26.100
- Well fuck you too, Georgie.

30:26.134 --> 30:27.998
I'm leaving.

30:28.033 --> 30:30.552
- Oh, that's what I've
been saying all day.

30:30.587 --> 30:31.484
You idiot!

30:31.519 --> 30:33.590
- [Mike] Oh, go to hell, Phil.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.040
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

30:36.041 --> 30:37.318
Oh, oh.

30:37.352 --> 30:39.078
He's capable of leaving
us here, you know?

30:39.113 --> 30:41.425
- Maybe you were a bit
too hard on him, Georgie.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.496
You better go and get after him.

30:44.739 --> 30:45.878
- [Georgie] Fine,
I'll go after him.

30:50.607 --> 30:52.851
- Christ's sake, Jack,
will you get a grip?

30:52.885 --> 30:54.887
- That bastard wanted
to fuck with me.

30:54.922 --> 30:56.199
These idiots aren't
gonna disappear,

30:56.233 --> 30:57.752
we need to create diversion.

30:57.786 --> 30:59.823
- Yeah, but not by going and
losing our cool on everything.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.100
- All right,
fucking ball buster.

31:01.135 --> 31:01.963
- Oh fuck.

31:01.998 --> 31:02.861
Fuck.

31:04.103 --> 31:07.106
[dramatic music]

31:07.141 --> 31:08.245
- Mike, wait.

31:09.177 --> 31:11.455
I wasn't being serious earlier.

31:11.490 --> 31:12.940
Come on, talk to me.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.702
Mike!

31:27.195 --> 31:28.024
Mike!

31:36.756 --> 31:37.585
Mike!

31:45.110 --> 31:47.422
[sniffling]

31:48.976 --> 31:51.771
- That was a real heroic
effort on your part.

31:51.806 --> 31:53.428
Two guys fighting, a
third guy jumps in--

31:53.463 --> 31:54.257
- Fuck you want?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.708
- How's your nose?

31:57.743 --> 32:00.228
- Yeah, it's been
better before, thanks.

32:00.263 --> 32:01.160
Fuck my nose.

32:01.195 --> 32:02.575
What about your hand, huh?

32:56.112 --> 32:58.252
[patting]

33:20.619 --> 33:21.758
- It's taking too long.

33:26.521 --> 33:27.695
I'm gonna go look for them.

33:27.729 --> 33:30.042
You stay here and
look after the others.

33:30.077 --> 33:31.181
- Ann.

33:31.216 --> 33:34.046
Please, try and convince
him to come back.

33:34.081 --> 33:35.116
I'm his assistant.

33:36.221 --> 33:38.361
Should've gone
after him, you know?

33:38.395 --> 33:41.881
- He's big enough to look
after himself, don't you think?

33:43.780 --> 33:46.093
[chuckling]

33:47.784 --> 33:49.717
- What a joke.

33:49.751 --> 33:51.753
[sighs]

33:57.932 --> 34:01.073
[light dramatic music]

34:02.557 --> 34:03.386
- Mike!

34:09.012 --> 34:09.840
Mike!

34:15.743 --> 34:16.571
Mike!

34:17.813 --> 34:20.230
[spooky music]

34:20.264 --> 34:23.371
[footsteps thudding]

34:56.887 --> 34:59.649
[warped yelling]

36:12.446 --> 36:15.449
[crickets chirping]

36:34.951 --> 36:35.779
- Phil.

36:37.436 --> 36:39.369
Let's go check on Alex.

37:07.190 --> 37:10.193
[dark spooky music]

37:21.515 --> 37:22.343
- Georgie!

37:33.389 --> 37:34.804
- Go away please.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.188
I said go away and
leave me alone.

37:40.223 --> 37:41.051
- Georgie.

37:42.018 --> 37:43.191
What happened?

37:45.435 --> 37:46.091
What did you see?

37:46.125 --> 37:47.126
Tell me.

37:53.236 --> 37:56.204
What's going on, where's Mike?

37:56.239 --> 37:57.620
What did you see?

37:58.655 --> 37:59.484
Tell me!

38:05.869 --> 38:07.457
Georgie!

38:07.492 --> 38:09.666
Georgie, Georgie, Georgie.

38:10.978 --> 38:13.463
What's going on, where's Mike?

38:14.430 --> 38:16.777
What's going on, where's Mike?

38:16.811 --> 38:19.297
What's going on, where's Mike?

38:25.717 --> 38:27.995
- So, what do you
do for a living?

38:29.410 --> 38:30.411
- I'm an accountant.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.830
- Hey, Matt, do you like music?

38:36.969 --> 38:39.800
[heavy breathing]

38:41.388 --> 38:43.631
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

38:43.666 --> 38:45.840
Then later on I'm gonna
show you something.

38:47.532 --> 38:48.360
- Why not?

38:48.395 --> 38:50.880
[eerie music]

39:04.928 --> 39:05.757
- What?

39:06.620 --> 39:07.862
What are you doing here?

39:07.897 --> 39:09.450
I was waiting for
you at the plane.

39:09.485 --> 39:11.383
- Georgie wanted to
keep looking for Mike.

39:11.418 --> 39:12.626
Alone.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.489
- Oh.

39:26.778 --> 39:28.642
- Why are you touching me?

39:28.676 --> 39:30.747
Get your hands off!

39:30.782 --> 39:32.197
- Don't you remember?

39:32.231 --> 39:33.301
Your tibia.

39:33.336 --> 39:34.717
- Tibia?

39:34.751 --> 39:37.409
- Your leg bone was
sticking out of your skin.

39:37.444 --> 39:38.859
- Where am I?

39:38.893 --> 39:40.101
I wanna get out of here.

39:40.136 --> 39:41.551
Jack, I wanna get out of here!

39:41.586 --> 39:43.519
- [hushes] You keep your
voice down, we're not alone.

39:43.553 --> 39:45.313
- Whatever, have
you got my stuff?

39:45.348 --> 39:47.764
I need to sniff or I'm
gonna have another crisis.

39:49.456 --> 39:51.561
- In-fucking-credible.

39:56.324 --> 39:59.155
[birds squawking]

40:00.605 --> 40:02.054
- [Phil] Georgie?

40:04.712 --> 40:07.025
[man yelling]

40:07.059 --> 40:10.028
- [Ann] Save yourself, Georgie.

40:10.062 --> 40:11.581
Georgie, well you won't die.

40:11.616 --> 40:13.307
Georgie, oh Georgie.

40:13.341 --> 40:14.826
Georgie.
- Come on, Georgie!

40:14.860 --> 40:17.173
- [Ann] Georgie,
you can hear it.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.346
- [Man] You can hear it!

40:18.381 --> 40:19.313
- Stop it.

40:19.347 --> 40:22.523
[muffled yelling]

40:22.558 --> 40:23.421
Stop it!

40:25.077 --> 40:26.907
Can't take it anymore.

40:29.530 --> 40:31.981
Can't take this shit anymore.

40:34.570 --> 40:35.847
Leave me alone.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.228
Leave me alone.

40:40.507 --> 40:42.923
Can't take this shit anymore.

40:47.790 --> 40:50.517
[dramatic music]

41:27.277 --> 41:28.624
- Georgie!

41:28.658 --> 41:30.695
Jesus Christ, we
were scared shitless.

41:30.729 --> 41:32.593
Where the hell
were you and Mike?

41:32.628 --> 41:34.802
Did you, did you convince
him to come back?

41:36.079 --> 41:38.979
- I think he wanted to
force us to follow him.

41:39.013 --> 41:40.014
- What?

41:40.049 --> 41:41.499
Why?

41:41.533 --> 41:44.122
Mike is who he is, but he
wouldn't wanna get rid of us.

41:45.882 --> 41:47.263
He left all his things here.

41:48.851 --> 41:50.508
Something must've
happened to him.

42:04.452 --> 42:06.316
- You can walk now?

42:06.351 --> 42:08.422
We're going, hurry up.

42:08.456 --> 42:09.906
- I'm fine, thanks for asking.

42:09.941 --> 42:11.149
- [Jack] I said hurry up.

42:11.183 --> 42:13.565
- [Matt] Hey, I don't
understand how you don't

42:13.600 --> 42:15.705
remember anything
after the crash.

42:15.740 --> 42:17.155
- Listen, accountant.

42:17.189 --> 42:19.847
I only remember I couldn't
stop laughing, okay?

42:19.882 --> 42:21.159
I was flying high.

42:22.056 --> 42:23.299
Don't get upset about it.

42:24.990 --> 42:26.992
[sighs]

42:29.132 --> 42:30.755
- The hole in my hand.

42:30.789 --> 42:33.309
- What's wrong with your hand?

42:34.690 --> 42:37.416
- I had a cut, I had a
bad cut after the accident

42:37.451 --> 42:39.073
when I got off the plane.

42:40.247 --> 42:41.489
It's completely gone now.

42:42.456 --> 42:43.284
It's disappeared.

42:45.873 --> 42:46.702
- It's true.

42:50.015 --> 42:51.258
Huh, me too.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.020
[groans]

42:55.055 --> 42:55.849
- God.

42:57.713 --> 42:58.541
Voila!

43:00.094 --> 43:01.613
- The scar I've had since
I was a kid, it's gone.

43:01.648 --> 43:02.752
- What a pile of crap.

43:03.650 --> 43:05.686
Hey, you.
- It's gone.

43:05.721 --> 43:07.619
- Is um.
- How can this be?

43:07.654 --> 43:10.035
- Is um the scar on my
ass still there, or?

43:10.070 --> 43:12.210
- Oh drop it, Phil.

43:13.936 --> 43:14.868
- Whatever.

43:16.317 --> 43:19.044
[dramatic music]

43:24.740 --> 43:27.259
[eerie music]

44:07.817 --> 44:08.853
- You ready?

44:08.887 --> 44:10.268
Get your stuff, let's go.

44:13.616 --> 44:14.928
- I don't think it's
a good idea to leave

44:14.962 --> 44:16.481
now that help's coming.

44:16.515 --> 44:17.862
- The only thing
that matters now

44:17.896 --> 44:19.898
is getting out of this
shithole as fast as possible.

44:19.933 --> 44:21.072
I don't wanna stay a
moment longer here,

44:21.106 --> 44:22.694
this place gives me the creeps.

44:22.729 --> 44:24.247
- But we need to
stay by the plane.

44:24.282 --> 44:25.145
The rescuers might--

44:25.179 --> 44:27.354
- What fucking rescuers?

44:27.388 --> 44:30.909
The pilot never
sent a mayday call.

44:30.944 --> 44:32.946
Nobody knows we're here.

44:35.224 --> 44:38.917
The sooner we get outta this
place, the better for everyone.

44:38.952 --> 44:41.230
- How can he not have
sent the mayday call?

44:41.264 --> 44:42.818
And what do you wanna
do with your pilot?

44:42.852 --> 44:44.095
You wanna leave him there?

44:44.129 --> 44:45.683
- You take me for a
fucking gravedigger?

44:47.132 --> 44:49.479
It bothers you so much, why
don't you do it yourself?

44:49.514 --> 44:52.517
It was that imbecile
that got us in this mess.

44:52.551 --> 44:55.002
As far as I'm concerned,
the dogs can have him.

44:56.348 --> 44:57.487
- Son of a bitch.

44:58.661 --> 45:00.249
Why didn't he tell
us that sooner?

45:00.283 --> 45:02.423
If we'd known that,
it'd be game changer.

45:02.458 --> 45:03.942
We could've gone back
to the repeater--

45:03.977 --> 45:06.358
- Listen, hun, you need to
calm yourself down, okay?

45:06.393 --> 45:09.258
Like he just said,
there's no help coming.

45:09.292 --> 45:11.743
Anyway, who elected
you group leader?

45:11.778 --> 45:13.641
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

45:13.676 --> 45:15.402
- Georgie, please,
try to stay calm.

45:15.436 --> 45:16.644
- Stay calm, Ann?

45:16.679 --> 45:18.060
Sure, that's easy
for you to say after

45:18.094 --> 45:19.958
you dragged our asses
into this shithole.

45:19.993 --> 45:21.408
- Oh, not that again.

45:21.442 --> 45:22.754
Try to be less childish.

45:22.789 --> 45:24.583
Forget about the repeater.

45:24.618 --> 45:25.999
- Careful, Ann, if
it hadn't been--

45:26.033 --> 45:27.966
- You're such an
insufferable egotist,

45:28.001 --> 45:29.727
you can't think beyond
your own ambitions--

45:29.761 --> 45:30.762
- God, enough already!

45:30.797 --> 45:31.970
Jesus Christ!

45:32.005 --> 45:33.454
- Phil's right,
will you calm down?

45:34.628 --> 45:36.181
- You're all just
passing around blame

45:36.216 --> 45:38.287
when we don't even know
what happened to Mike.

45:38.321 --> 45:39.737
God!

45:39.771 --> 45:42.118
You said you were gonna bring
him back and you didn't.

45:43.223 --> 45:44.258
Something's happened to him.

45:44.293 --> 45:45.432
I'm sure of it.

45:45.466 --> 45:46.467
Fuck!
- Well, don't tell me, Phil.

45:46.502 --> 45:47.883
I was against it from the start.

45:47.917 --> 45:49.263
And it was stupid
to come here without

45:49.298 --> 45:50.955
activating the SOS first.

45:50.989 --> 45:52.819
- Oh, fuck off!

45:52.853 --> 45:53.958
I've had enough of you.

45:53.992 --> 45:54.786
Go to hell.

45:54.821 --> 45:56.201
- Great.

45:56.236 --> 45:57.133
Now go look for our
brilliant Mike on your own.

45:57.168 --> 45:58.963
- All right, Georgie, time out.

45:58.997 --> 46:00.447
Okay?

46:00.481 --> 46:02.104
You're just starting to lose
your senses a little bit

46:02.138 --> 46:03.036
but you can calm down.

46:03.070 --> 46:04.831
All of us can calm down.

46:04.865 --> 46:06.798
- Well, tell her that then.

46:06.833 --> 46:10.008
- Hey, Wonder Woman, are
you stoned out of your mind?

46:10.043 --> 46:11.976
Have you got any left for me?

46:12.010 --> 46:13.080
- I'm not high.

46:13.115 --> 46:14.288
You're the fucked up one.

46:14.323 --> 46:15.462
You don't even
know where we are!

46:15.496 --> 46:16.325
- Hey!

46:16.359 --> 46:19.707
Fuck you!

46:19.742 --> 46:21.226
- [Georgie] Bitch.

46:25.955 --> 46:28.786
[birds squawking]

46:32.720 --> 46:35.206
[eerie music]

47:01.611 --> 47:04.545
[crows cawing]

47:04.580 --> 47:07.583
[crickets chirping]

47:14.348 --> 47:16.040
- What do you
think we should do?

47:16.074 --> 47:19.077
- Hey, don't look at me, man.

47:19.112 --> 47:21.735
I'm not the one
making decisions.

47:23.081 --> 47:25.359
- Well your friend,
she's got the right idea.

47:25.394 --> 47:27.051
I think we should
stick together.

47:43.481 --> 47:44.413
- Okay, got it.

47:44.447 --> 47:45.276
No rescue.

47:46.691 --> 47:49.452
We'll head for a van and you
guys, you do whatever you want.

47:49.487 --> 47:50.868
- [Matt] Georgie.

47:50.902 --> 47:53.008
It's okay, we go with you too.

47:53.871 --> 47:54.699
Right, Jack?

47:59.807 --> 48:02.707
- Okay, but keep your friend
Mike well away from me

48:02.741 --> 48:06.055
or I swear I'll cook him
up and have him for dinner.

48:12.682 --> 48:15.168
[eerie music]

48:25.868 --> 48:26.938
- Hey, you got a problem?

48:26.973 --> 48:28.388
- No, why?

48:28.422 --> 48:29.596
- So stop watching me.

48:29.630 --> 48:30.804
- Oh, relax.

48:30.838 --> 48:33.324
Just looking at your
cute little ass.

48:33.358 --> 48:36.223
I know some customers that
would pay well for that shit.

48:36.258 --> 48:38.294
Really, not bad at all.

48:40.814 --> 48:43.058
- Keep your ears
open, all right?

48:43.092 --> 48:46.026
Those idiots came down
here in a camper van.

48:46.061 --> 48:48.201
When we get there we
need to ditch them.

48:48.235 --> 48:49.788
- Then what?

48:49.823 --> 48:50.617
- Well--

48:50.651 --> 48:52.032
- Wait a minute.

48:52.067 --> 48:53.378
What do you plan on doing?

48:54.310 --> 48:55.863
- Steal it.

48:55.898 --> 48:57.555
Go back when the
waters are calmer.

48:57.589 --> 49:00.178
- Jesus Christ, come on.
- Just do what I say, okay?

49:01.317 --> 49:02.940
Unless you want your
ex-wife's lawyer

49:02.974 --> 49:04.596
to know what you
do for a living.

49:06.253 --> 49:09.463
I'm sure you'll like sending
postcards to your daughters.

49:25.997 --> 49:27.930
- Phil, slow down, wait for us.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.971
[gasping]
[dramatic music]

49:38.630 --> 49:40.805
Phil, I said stop!

49:40.839 --> 49:44.153
[static buzzing]

49:44.188 --> 49:45.085
Phil, stop!

49:46.707 --> 49:47.915
Phil, I said stop!

49:52.575 --> 49:54.784
- Hey, marathon man.

49:54.819 --> 49:56.096
What's wrong with him?

49:56.131 --> 49:58.305
[zapping]

49:59.582 --> 50:00.480
- Phil!

50:00.514 --> 50:04.070
[dramatic electronic music]

50:11.939 --> 50:14.183
[sizzling]

50:20.327 --> 50:22.674
- Jack, Jack, we need to go!

50:29.923 --> 50:31.062
We need to go!

50:32.443 --> 50:33.892
Let's go, Jack, let's go--

50:33.927 --> 50:36.067
- Shut the fuck up, bitch!

50:51.393 --> 50:54.120
[static buzzing]

50:56.915 --> 50:59.297
- Do you hear it too?

50:59.332 --> 51:00.126
- What?

51:00.160 --> 51:00.919
The radio?

51:02.128 --> 51:03.957
Off, damn it!

51:03.991 --> 51:06.718
[dramatic music]

51:23.218 --> 51:25.910
[radio buzzing]

51:41.167 --> 51:42.547
- It's a barrier.

51:45.171 --> 51:46.344
Georgie, come back.

51:54.766 --> 51:57.148
It's a force field, right?

51:58.425 --> 51:59.219
Georgie?

52:02.671 --> 52:04.569
- That bastard tells
me he loves me.

52:04.604 --> 52:07.124
- [Jack] The edge
of a force field?

52:07.158 --> 52:09.402
Mind telling me what
you're going on about?

52:09.436 --> 52:11.162
- Yeah, it's possible.

52:12.819 --> 52:15.166
The interference
deactivated the repeater.

52:15.201 --> 52:16.926
What do you reckon?

52:16.961 --> 52:17.893
- I dunno.

52:17.927 --> 52:19.826
Something we haven't seen yet.

52:19.860 --> 52:22.139
[dramatic music]

52:22.173 --> 52:25.142
[crickets chirping]

52:44.816 --> 52:47.474
[radio buzzing]

52:51.651 --> 52:52.617
- Come on.

52:52.652 --> 52:53.894
Let's try somewhere else.

53:10.117 --> 53:12.258
[buzzing]

53:48.501 --> 53:49.329
- Enough.

53:50.537 --> 53:51.642
We need to rest.

53:52.815 --> 53:54.231
We've been walking for hours.

54:12.939 --> 54:14.768
[crying]
- Hey, Matt.

54:14.803 --> 54:16.356
Do you like music?

54:16.391 --> 54:19.290
Later on let me
show you something.

54:23.881 --> 54:25.676
- Now what do we do?

54:25.710 --> 54:27.540
You saw that poor guy!

54:30.474 --> 54:32.890
[laughing]

54:32.924 --> 54:35.272
- Chocolate always
melts in the sun.

54:35.306 --> 54:36.134
- Hey!

54:37.481 --> 54:38.999
His name was Phil.

54:41.070 --> 54:44.315
[light dramatic music]

55:01.125 --> 55:02.851
What are you thinking about?

55:02.885 --> 55:04.853
- Nothing, just
looking at the lake.

55:06.406 --> 55:08.339
The epicenter of the
transmission generating

55:08.374 --> 55:11.411
the force field is in that lake.

55:33.191 --> 55:35.539
- Why don't we try
disrupting the transmitter

55:35.573 --> 55:37.023
that's carrying the signal?

55:37.057 --> 55:40.440
- Ann, you have to identify the
entity and its source first.

55:40.475 --> 55:42.235
- And what are we
gonna do that with?

55:42.269 --> 55:43.374
Our phones?

55:43.409 --> 55:44.720
- How the hell
should I know, Ann?

55:47.999 --> 55:49.553
- The ADF.

55:49.587 --> 55:51.796
Yeah.

55:51.831 --> 55:53.419
Yeah, the ADF, the ADF.

55:53.453 --> 55:57.250
It's a rather outmoded
navigational tool
used on airplanes,

55:57.284 --> 55:59.321
it's like a radio compass.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.047
It tunes into a
broadcast station

56:01.081 --> 56:04.361
and the station indicates
how to reach it.

56:04.395 --> 56:07.018
Now, if we can probe
the frequency range,

56:08.019 --> 56:09.366
if we can do that--
- Fuck.

56:10.505 --> 56:12.334
That useless friend
of yours got lost

56:12.369 --> 56:13.853
and dumped us in that damn lake.

56:13.887 --> 56:16.442
- What the hell's that
got to do with us now?

56:16.476 --> 56:17.408
- Don't you get it?

56:18.754 --> 56:19.997
That's right, idiot.

56:20.031 --> 56:22.102
The signal got lost
and left us to rot!

56:23.897 --> 56:24.795
- Well why don't we
go back to the plane

56:24.829 --> 56:25.830
and at least give it a go?

56:25.865 --> 56:26.659
- Fuck that.

56:26.693 --> 56:27.970
You wanna go, go.

56:28.005 --> 56:29.213
I'm not going back
to that cesspool.

56:29.247 --> 56:31.491
- Well you got a
better idea, then?

56:31.526 --> 56:32.768
- Listen, smart-ass.

56:32.803 --> 56:34.598
Just because you know
how to fly a plane,

56:34.632 --> 56:36.254
don't start getting
fucking carried away.

56:36.289 --> 56:38.947
And for your information, I'm
not going back to that wreck.

56:38.981 --> 56:40.086
Got it?
- Hey, look!

56:47.956 --> 56:49.406
- Fuck, let's follow them.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.511
Maybe they'll lead us
in the right direction.

56:53.927 --> 56:55.653
- Okay, let's try.

56:55.688 --> 56:56.620
But carefully.

56:58.725 --> 56:59.554
Let's go.

57:12.808 --> 57:17.813
[light dramatic music]
[radio static buzzing]

57:22.646 --> 57:23.957
Be careful, Jack.

57:23.992 --> 57:25.407
- It's all right.

57:36.314 --> 57:39.041
[sizzling]
[yelling]

57:39.076 --> 57:39.904
Fuck!

57:40.974 --> 57:43.736
What are you
fucking laughing at?

57:43.770 --> 57:44.737
- Great.

57:44.771 --> 57:45.669
Now what do we do?

57:47.153 --> 57:49.362
- Listen, I don't feel
like going any further.

57:49.396 --> 57:52.158
I say we go back to the
plane and give it a try.

57:52.192 --> 57:53.677
We should figure
out the problem.

57:55.713 --> 57:58.233
We don't know what or who
we're dealing with here.

57:59.683 --> 58:02.617
[light eerie music]

58:05.654 --> 58:06.483
- Fuck!

58:08.312 --> 58:09.520
We can't get out of here.

58:15.215 --> 58:18.460
[light dramatic music]

58:56.981 --> 58:58.431
- Fuck, I can't find my stuff!

58:58.465 --> 58:59.708
Have you got any for me?
- [hushes] They'll hear you,

58:59.743 --> 59:01.296
I haven't got it.
- Well, I need it.

59:01.330 --> 59:02.228
- I haven't got it, I told you.

59:02.262 --> 59:03.712
Now you pay me for it, anyway.

59:03.747 --> 59:04.575
- Come on.

59:05.611 --> 59:08.372
In exchange I let you fuck me.

59:09.338 --> 59:10.270
[chuckles]

59:10.305 --> 59:11.478
- You let me fuck you?

59:12.618 --> 59:15.241
I don't have to pay
to fuck my women.

59:15.275 --> 59:17.001
They pay me when
I go with clients

59:17.036 --> 59:18.624
and that includes you.

59:19.763 --> 59:21.074
- Are you sure about that?

59:29.600 --> 59:31.119
- Walk!

59:31.153 --> 59:33.362
This is not the time, you idiot.

59:33.397 --> 59:34.812
- [Alex] Asshole.

59:53.244 --> 59:57.145
- [Georgie] Matt, you've
given up, haven't you?

59:57.179 --> 59:59.043
What happened to you?

59:59.078 --> 01:00:01.667
- You say that like
you used to know me.

01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:03.392
What happened to me?

01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:07.465
I dunno, the usual things.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.641
Divorce, losing
custody of the kids,

01:00:10.676 --> 01:00:13.264
and now, and now this.

01:00:14.231 --> 01:00:15.612
Food, survival.

01:00:17.683 --> 01:00:19.167
You know, it's complicated, but,

01:00:19.201 --> 01:00:22.273
I don't even think I
wanna go home again.

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:24.103
It's not like there's
anybody there.

01:00:25.794 --> 01:00:29.902
Waiting, wondering, why
the hell is it taking

01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:31.489
so long for Matt to come home?

01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:34.216
- [Georgie] What
kinda work do you do?

01:00:34.251 --> 01:00:35.217
- Yeah, I'm an accountant.

01:00:35.252 --> 01:00:37.564
I do Jack's accounting.

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:39.118
- God, I'm hungry.

01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:40.326
What do we've got to eat in

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.777
this fucking shitty
lake of frogs?

01:00:42.811 --> 01:00:44.813
- And you, what do you do?
- Fuck!

01:00:44.848 --> 01:00:46.643
- I develop software
for a company

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:48.265
that makes satellite repeaters.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.061
- That's interesting.

01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:54.167
No, no, I mean that.

01:00:54.202 --> 01:00:57.688
When I look at you I can tell
you love what you're doing.

01:00:57.723 --> 01:00:58.620
- Beginning I did.

01:01:00.173 --> 01:01:01.243
Then that all changed.

01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:04.661
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:01:06.076 --> 01:01:07.318
What brought you here?

01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:09.873
To this prison?

01:01:15.395 --> 01:01:20.055
You know, aside from us,
I think something else

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:21.816
landed in that lake.

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:24.370
[eerie music]

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:40.179
Jesus Christ.
[coughing]

01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:42.699
- How can he be
that bad already?

01:01:44.528 --> 01:01:46.979
[gagging]

01:01:47.013 --> 01:01:49.084
- It's impossible after
such a short time.

01:01:50.776 --> 01:01:54.296
- Yeah, around here time
is pretty much uncertain.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.610
I mean, look at your hand.

01:02:02.235 --> 01:02:04.375
- The fuck we
gonna do with that?

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:08.069
[coughing]

01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:20.426
[door squeaking]

01:02:26.363 --> 01:02:28.641
[grunting]

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:41.067
- You think it'll
sink like this?

01:02:43.518 --> 01:02:45.451
- Don't worry,
I'm gonna undo it.

01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:47.764
- My Jack, he can fix anything.

01:02:48.972 --> 01:02:50.974
- Oh yeah, he's a
real expert, right?

01:02:54.322 --> 01:02:56.531
Who knows how many times
he's done it before.

01:03:03.849 --> 01:03:05.712
- What you looking at?

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.373
That's how you gotta do it.

01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:14.411
[suspenseful music]

01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:35.052
Well, come on.

01:03:36.398 --> 01:03:37.572
Help me for once.

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:39.298
You're always off your tits.

01:03:40.161 --> 01:03:43.440
[light dramatic music]

01:03:53.795 --> 01:03:55.590
- That's the ADF instrument.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.593
That was indicating the
direction, first of all,

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:00.733
and to get to the radio station.

01:04:00.767 --> 01:04:03.529
At some point this
little bastard's

01:04:03.563 --> 01:04:05.462
indicated direction changed.

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:09.500
That caused us to
veer off route.

01:04:09.535 --> 01:04:12.814
Pilot, I dunno.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.886
At some point he
was okay with it

01:04:15.921 --> 01:04:20.442
and then he saw that we were,
time was passing and uh,

01:04:20.477 --> 01:04:24.205
well, he veered off course
and we lost all our fuel.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:25.240
He was a good guy.

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:27.139
Okay.

01:04:28.347 --> 01:04:30.728
I hope I don't short
circuit everything.

01:04:33.628 --> 01:04:34.871
I'm turning the power on.

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:36.907
You ready?

01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:42.499
[whirring]

01:04:44.846 --> 01:04:45.674
All right.

01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:48.022
Okay.

01:04:48.056 --> 01:04:51.266
For now I'm gonna turn
this ADF onto listen.

01:04:55.753 --> 01:04:58.411
[radio buzzing]

01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:03.969
[light dramatic music]

01:05:09.112 --> 01:05:11.355
[giggling]

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:25.128
[deep exhaling]

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:32.583
- Did you ever think
of becoming a pilot?

01:05:32.618 --> 01:05:35.276
- Yeah, actually I did.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:38.106
And then I met Lucy, my ex-wife.

01:05:39.383 --> 01:05:41.420
She didn't wanna hear
about me flying around

01:05:41.454 --> 01:05:45.389
in the skies with a bunch
of flight attendants, so.

01:05:45.424 --> 01:05:48.772
Anyway, she convinced
me to look for a job,

01:05:48.806 --> 01:05:51.568
how should I say,
closer to ground?

01:05:53.363 --> 01:05:55.296
So I was good at
math, so you know,

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.367
I became a certified accountant.

01:06:01.026 --> 01:06:01.923
Yeah, whatever.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.269
She clipped my wings, right?

01:06:03.304 --> 01:06:05.582
[laughing]

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.460
- What's got you now?

01:06:21.494 --> 01:06:25.602
- We're like two lovers
out on a little excursion,

01:06:27.535 --> 01:06:31.504
in a boat, except
instead of there being

01:06:31.539 --> 01:06:36.233
a picnic hamper, there's
a corpse covered in worms!

01:06:36.268 --> 01:06:38.408
- You're always stoned.

01:06:38.442 --> 01:06:39.926
- So?

01:06:39.961 --> 01:06:42.067
Have you got any
hidden anywhere?

01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:44.276
Come on, Jack,
show me the stuff.

01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:47.658
[spits]

01:06:48.728 --> 01:06:49.764
It's all your fault.

01:06:50.972 --> 01:06:54.389
Now I'm even having an attack.

01:06:54.424 --> 01:06:55.908
You're a shit.

01:06:55.942 --> 01:06:58.704
You made me come to this
shithole without my stuff!

01:06:58.738 --> 01:07:00.499
- Do me a favor, shut up.

01:07:00.533 --> 01:07:01.741
- What I'm saying is,

01:07:01.776 --> 01:07:04.054
is this really a place
to bring a woman to?

01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:04.951
Huh?

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:08.231
Fuck off, shithead, I
want my fucking stuff.

01:07:08.265 --> 01:07:09.439
Son of a bitch.

01:07:10.267 --> 01:07:11.682
- I said shut it.

01:07:11.717 --> 01:07:13.063
- Fucking ignorant gangster.

01:07:13.098 --> 01:07:14.064
- Fucking whore!

01:07:15.686 --> 01:07:17.481
Now shut the fuck up
or you'll be joining

01:07:17.516 --> 01:07:19.104
our friend in the fucking water!

01:07:21.865 --> 01:07:24.592
[dramatic music]

01:07:28.285 --> 01:07:30.460
[buzzing]

01:07:31.702 --> 01:07:32.703
- You find anything]

01:07:32.738 --> 01:07:34.843
[hushes]

01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:00.490
[water splashes]

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.976
[eerie music]

01:08:05.702 --> 01:08:07.428
- That sounds like
a voice message.

01:08:10.672 --> 01:08:12.605
Hey, what do you think?

01:08:16.057 --> 01:08:17.541
What do you think?

01:08:20.406 --> 01:08:23.099
[radio beeping]

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:31.728
- Your mind is me.

01:08:38.183 --> 01:08:40.426
[groaning]

01:08:42.462 --> 01:08:44.810
[screaming]

01:08:45.845 --> 01:08:46.674
- Jack!

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:49.917
Oh!

01:08:49.953 --> 01:08:51.437
- Oh my god, Jack!

01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:54.854
- Help me, Jack!

01:08:56.408 --> 01:08:58.548
- Get out of there!

01:08:58.582 --> 01:08:59.825
Get out!

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:00.859
Hurry!
- Fuck!

01:09:00.895 --> 01:09:02.448
- Get out of there!

01:09:03.656 --> 01:09:05.417
- Jack!
- Jack!

01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.625
Come on, Jack!

01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:08.937
- [Alex] Help me, God!

01:09:08.971 --> 01:09:10.145
Come on, Jack!

01:09:11.388 --> 01:09:12.907
Jack!
- Hurry!

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:13.977
- Get me out of here!

01:09:14.011 --> 01:09:15.875
Fuck!
- Come on!

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:17.153
- Jack!
- Hurry!

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.707
- Fuck!
- Keep going!

01:09:21.363 --> 01:09:22.537
Come on, Jack!

01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:25.506
Get out of there.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.060
- Fuck!

01:09:29.095 --> 01:09:31.443
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:09:31.477 --> 01:09:32.305
- Come on!

01:09:33.376 --> 01:09:34.515
- Get me out here.

01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:36.895
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:50.288
[fire crackling]

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:52.291
- What is that dang force field?

01:09:52.326 --> 01:09:55.191
It's deactivating, your mind
just means you're alive,

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:56.882
means your, means your alive.

01:09:56.916 --> 01:10:00.092
Issues with Jack,
issues with Jack.

01:10:00.126 --> 01:10:03.544
Your mind is mean,
your mind is mean.

01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:06.236
Your mind is mean,
your mind is mean,

01:10:06.271 --> 01:10:08.618
your mind is mean,
your mind is mean,

01:10:08.652 --> 01:10:10.171
your mind is mean.
- Georgie.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.277
Hey.

01:10:12.311 --> 01:10:13.381
Georgie, you okay?

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:19.422
- We could be in the
middle of an experiment.

01:10:19.456 --> 01:10:21.320
- Yeah, that's it.

01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:25.151
They're using a weapon
to experiment on us.

01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:26.360
[laughing]

01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:27.568
Fucking great!

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:30.122
Come on!

01:10:30.156 --> 01:10:31.468
Fucking come on!

01:10:33.401 --> 01:10:35.231
If I get my hands on
you I'll fix your ass!

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:37.819
- Jack.

01:10:37.854 --> 01:10:38.993
Jack!

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.028
Calm down.

01:10:40.063 --> 01:10:41.133
- Calm down?

01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:41.961
Calm down?

01:10:41.996 --> 01:10:44.723
You calm down, asshole!

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:46.034
- Think about it, Georgie.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.313
We're dealing with
a very powerful

01:10:48.347 --> 01:10:50.142
electromagnetic force field.

01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:51.971
- Yeah, that's right!

01:10:52.006 --> 01:10:53.214
- Wait a minute.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.836
If this is a
scientific experiment,

01:10:54.871 --> 01:10:55.941
then they realize we're here,

01:10:55.975 --> 01:10:57.253
so sooner or later they're gonna

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.600
come down and check on
us for Christ's sake.

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:01.118
- Great, genius.

01:11:01.153 --> 01:11:03.328
And what the fuck
difference would that make?

01:11:03.362 --> 01:11:05.019
What are we gonna
do in the meantime?

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:09.230
Sit here from dawn to
dusk eating fucking frogs?

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.302
- Georgie, we need to
get out of here fast.

01:11:13.372 --> 01:11:14.787
- Sit down, dolly.

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:17.480
I've had the arm already.

01:11:17.514 --> 01:11:19.516
I'm not having my
balls fried now.

01:11:24.383 --> 01:11:25.660
- It's not an experiment.

01:11:28.836 --> 01:11:30.596
I don't think it's
a weapon, either.

01:11:33.772 --> 01:11:35.429
- Your head is fucked.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.643
- The dogs, the birds.

01:11:43.713 --> 01:11:44.852
They can go in and out.

01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:49.132
It's just us and only us
that can't pass through.

01:11:50.823 --> 01:11:52.584
The mechanism's more complex.

01:11:55.587 --> 01:11:58.348
When Alexandria was attacked
in the middle of the lake

01:11:59.487 --> 01:12:01.282
the force field stopped
for a few minutes.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.218
That's the time to
pass through it.

01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:16.953
[fire crackling]

01:12:52.298 --> 01:12:54.749
[light music]

01:13:31.476 --> 01:13:34.237
[dramatic music]

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:00.470
[soft moaning]

01:14:45.273 --> 01:14:47.655
[chattering]

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:56.733
[light eerie music]

01:15:10.126 --> 01:15:12.956
[door screeching]

01:15:18.203 --> 01:15:20.999
- Where the hell do
you think you're going?

01:15:21.033 --> 01:15:23.795
- There's something in that
lake that won't let us out.

01:15:27.384 --> 01:15:29.386
Where were you
going on that plane?

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:32.838
- Okay.

01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:37.809
It was a secret
flight, all right?

01:15:37.843 --> 01:15:39.086
To avoid any security.

01:15:40.777 --> 01:15:42.710
Jack closed a deal,
it was a shady deal,

01:15:42.745 --> 01:15:44.643
and we were coming
home with the cash.

01:15:44.678 --> 01:15:47.577
I don't even know where
the money comes from

01:15:47.612 --> 01:15:49.096
'cause all I do is launder it.

01:15:50.615 --> 01:15:51.857
'Cause I'm his accountant.

01:15:51.892 --> 01:15:53.687
Oh shit, Georgie.

01:15:53.721 --> 01:15:54.826
I got fired.

01:15:56.034 --> 01:15:58.554
If I don't cut a check
to my wi, my ex-wife,

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.039
then I don't get to see my kids.

01:16:02.765 --> 01:16:04.594
And they're all I got.

01:16:05.526 --> 01:16:07.183
You understand that?

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:20.092
[eerie suspenseful music]

01:16:27.997 --> 01:16:30.827
[soft whispering]

01:16:55.024 --> 01:16:57.785
[warped talking]

01:18:01.573 --> 01:18:04.334
[dramatic music]

01:19:25.484 --> 01:19:28.246
[birds chirping]

01:19:29.316 --> 01:19:32.319
[light eerie music]

01:19:43.261 --> 01:19:46.091
[water splashing]

01:19:51.372 --> 01:19:52.960
- [Ann] What have you
been doing all night?

01:19:52.995 --> 01:19:54.341
I was looking for you.

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:55.687
- You were looking for me?

01:19:56.895 --> 01:19:57.793
Why, Ann?

01:19:59.553 --> 01:20:02.142
Are you afraid I'll
get away from you, Ann?

01:20:05.248 --> 01:20:07.492
- [Ann] Why are you
looking at me like that?

01:20:07.526 --> 01:20:08.596
- Like what, Ann?

01:20:09.666 --> 01:20:10.771
Like what, Ann?

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.669
- [Ann] Georgie, stop it!

01:20:12.704 --> 01:20:14.188
- Are you getting
turned on, Ann?

01:20:15.396 --> 01:20:16.742
Do you want me to
touch you, Ann?

01:20:16.777 --> 01:20:19.159
[gasping]

01:20:19.193 --> 01:20:21.368
[moaning]

01:20:57.507 --> 01:21:00.131
- Jack, wake up.

01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:01.960
Jack, wake up!

01:21:01.995 --> 01:21:03.099
- Where the fuck?

01:21:04.307 --> 01:21:05.308
- Ann and Georgie,
they're not here.

01:21:05.343 --> 01:21:06.171
Where'd they go?

01:21:08.449 --> 01:21:09.795
- Who gives a damn?

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.107
It's exactly what we want.

01:21:12.315 --> 01:21:13.420
- No, no, we gotta
go look for 'em.

01:21:13.454 --> 01:21:14.697
- Are you crazy?

01:21:15.698 --> 01:21:17.044
They're out of our hair now.

01:21:17.079 --> 01:21:18.563
Get off your ass.

01:21:18.597 --> 01:21:20.323
Time to get my money back.

01:21:20.358 --> 01:21:23.809
- I mean, what do you
intend to do, Jack?

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:45.797
[sniffling]

01:21:58.051 --> 01:22:00.225
[stomping]

01:22:16.793 --> 01:22:20.487
- I know what it is
you're looking at.

01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:21.453
There's something in that lake

01:22:21.488 --> 01:22:23.076
you don't want us to know about.

01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:26.182
And it's not earthly.

01:22:33.155 --> 01:22:36.882
I'm not as stupid as
you think, Georgie.

01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:39.437
And I also know that you've
found a way out of this,

01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:40.679
like you always do.

01:22:42.164 --> 01:22:46.478
But this time you
will not put me aside.

01:22:46.513 --> 01:22:49.481
- Well, well, well, how moving.

01:22:49.516 --> 01:22:51.138
It's a lesbian romance.

01:22:52.726 --> 01:22:56.281
But before you start playing
with each other's tits,

01:22:56.316 --> 01:22:58.352
where's my fucking money?

01:22:58.387 --> 01:22:59.975
- Jack, come on, now.
- Shut it!

01:23:01.493 --> 01:23:05.187
We're leaving here, but
not without my money!

01:23:05.221 --> 01:23:07.189
- [Ann] And how're you getting
through the force field?

01:23:07.223 --> 01:23:08.052
- I've got this!

01:23:09.639 --> 01:23:13.609
I can get through
without pissing off
Tutan-fucking-khamun.

01:23:13.643 --> 01:23:16.577
- Maybe they got an idea
- I said shut it, dickhead.

01:23:19.132 --> 01:23:21.341
So come on, babe,
show me the money

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:24.344
or you're gonna be
my bitch tonight!

01:23:24.378 --> 01:23:25.621
[dramatic music]
[thudding]

01:23:25.655 --> 01:23:26.553
Dickhead!

01:23:26.587 --> 01:23:28.348
- You're looking for this?

01:23:28.382 --> 01:23:31.903
- You bitch!
[laughing]

01:23:31.937 --> 01:23:33.767
What are you
fucking laughing at?

01:23:34.871 --> 01:23:37.184
Fucking laugh at this!
- Jack, no!

01:23:38.841 --> 01:23:41.326
[gun banging]

01:23:42.776 --> 01:23:45.503
[dramatic music]

01:23:49.438 --> 01:23:51.336
- [Jack] Fucking bitch.

01:23:52.924 --> 01:23:53.752
Fuck!

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:01.967
[soft moaning]

01:24:02.002 --> 01:24:03.383
Come back here, bitch.

01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:07.145
Where the fuck do you
think you're going?

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:10.252
Fucking come back
here with my money!

01:24:12.012 --> 01:24:13.393
[cackling]

01:24:13.427 --> 01:24:15.602
You can run away with my
money, is that what you think?

01:24:15.636 --> 01:24:18.087
Is that what you think, bitch?

01:24:18.122 --> 01:24:20.227
Think you can run up
into the fucking woods

01:24:20.262 --> 01:24:22.091
with my fucking money?

01:24:22.988 --> 01:24:24.128
Is that what you think?

01:24:24.162 --> 01:24:25.405
Is that what you think
you can do to me?

01:24:25.439 --> 01:24:27.821
Well, let's fucking
find out, shall we?

01:24:27.855 --> 01:24:29.961
Let's fucking find out!

01:24:29.995 --> 01:24:33.999
I'll find you wherever you
are, you fucking whore!

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.453
Come on, babe.

01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:44.217
You think you can do
this to me, do ya?

01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:45.942
Come back here, you.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.912
[radio buzzing]

01:24:56.194 --> 01:24:59.611
[gun banging]
Hey, bitch!

01:25:05.548 --> 01:25:08.137
[rattling]

01:25:08.172 --> 01:25:09.034
Fuck.

01:25:11.175 --> 01:25:15.869
[yelling]
[gun banging]

01:25:18.043 --> 01:25:21.599
Come back here,
you fucking whore!

01:25:21.633 --> 01:25:24.705
You can't fucking get away!

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.568
Fuck you!

01:25:27.398 --> 01:25:29.641
[coughing]

01:25:33.542 --> 01:25:35.820
[grunting]

01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:43.690
[heavy breathing]

01:25:46.796 --> 01:25:47.728
[yelling]

01:25:47.763 --> 01:25:48.833
[funky music]

01:25:48.867 --> 01:25:51.111
[thudding]

01:25:58.118 --> 01:26:00.224
[panting]

01:26:27.043 --> 01:26:27.872
- Jack!

01:26:29.805 --> 01:26:30.633
Ann!

01:26:33.153 --> 01:26:33.981
Jack!

01:26:41.817 --> 01:26:43.336
Ann.

01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:44.199
Ann!

01:26:46.787 --> 01:26:47.616
- Jack.

01:26:48.858 --> 01:26:50.377
Jack tried to kill me.

01:26:52.931 --> 01:26:54.726
- Are you all right?

01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:55.589
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wait a minute, wait wait.

01:26:55.624 --> 01:26:56.832
Jack, where'd he go?

01:26:56.866 --> 01:26:58.282
Tell me, tell me where
he is, what'd he do?

01:26:58.316 --> 01:27:01.699
- I think he's dead on the
other side of the force field.

01:27:02.838 --> 01:27:04.357
He tried to go through
with the damn bag!

01:27:13.089 --> 01:27:14.401
- What the hell is going on?

01:27:14.436 --> 01:27:16.714
[thudding]

01:27:24.825 --> 01:27:27.103
[laughing]

01:27:54.683 --> 01:27:56.857
[gasping]

01:28:15.945 --> 01:28:19.190
[light dramatic music]

01:28:27.198 --> 01:28:30.684
- [Georgie] What are
you doing to me, Ann?

01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.861
[laughing]

01:28:34.895 --> 01:28:36.621
- Look who's talking.

01:28:38.485 --> 01:28:41.385
You'd have left me
to die in that lake

01:28:41.419 --> 01:28:45.320
like that poor fucking whore
turning into fuck knows what.

01:28:47.114 --> 01:28:50.152
But the process isn't
working, is it, Georgie?

01:28:50.186 --> 01:28:51.256
Is it, Georgie?

01:28:54.639 --> 01:28:55.537
Except for you.

01:28:57.159 --> 01:29:02.095
Except for poor, psycho,
schizo little you.

01:29:12.864 --> 01:29:14.521
It's that, isn't it?

01:29:15.936 --> 01:29:18.007
It's letting you make
the link with them.

01:29:21.425 --> 01:29:23.358
Take a good look at
yourself, Georgie.

01:29:24.566 --> 01:29:26.153
Take a good look.

01:29:29.329 --> 01:29:30.157
I am Ann.

01:29:31.607 --> 01:29:35.231
And if I still know one
thing I know that I am not

01:29:35.266 --> 01:29:38.096
gonna let you go through
with your crazy little plan.

01:29:40.029 --> 01:29:42.100
Screw what's in your head.

01:29:42.135 --> 01:29:43.930
Screw what's in the lake.

01:29:43.964 --> 01:29:45.034
You are mine.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.390
[grunting]

01:30:03.087 --> 01:30:03.915
- Georgie.

01:30:05.883 --> 01:30:09.058
[dark dramatic music]

01:31:07.358 --> 01:31:09.636
[splashing]

01:31:16.954 --> 01:31:17.782
Georgie!

01:31:18.783 --> 01:31:20.751
Georgie, get away!

01:31:20.785 --> 01:31:21.683
Go get her!

01:31:24.686 --> 01:31:25.514
Hey!

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:39.597
Oh!

01:31:39.632 --> 01:31:41.944
- With my fingers deactivating.

01:31:41.979 --> 01:31:44.188
[warped talking]

01:31:44.222 --> 01:31:45.396
- Who are you?

01:31:47.156 --> 01:31:49.400
- [Georgie] Come with me, Ann.

01:31:49.434 --> 01:31:51.298
Then I can do the rest.

01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:54.336
And we can finally be together.

01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:57.063
[dramatic music]

01:31:58.996 --> 01:32:01.654
No one will ever
come between us.

01:32:03.034 --> 01:32:05.968
- No one will ever
come between us.

01:32:13.355 --> 01:32:16.185
[water splashing]

01:32:24.677 --> 01:32:26.092
- Die, you bitch.

01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:30.579
[yelling]

01:32:31.684 --> 01:32:33.962
[groaning]

01:32:39.036 --> 01:32:41.314
[laughing]

01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:04.682
[suspenseful music]

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.137
- The damn repeater.

01:33:13.173 --> 01:33:15.348
[gasping]

01:33:17.695 --> 01:33:20.042
[screaming]

01:34:13.993 --> 01:34:15.442
- [Matt] Georgie.

01:34:27.213 --> 01:34:29.111
- No, not now, damn it.

01:34:38.534 --> 01:34:40.744
[grunting]

01:34:45.852 --> 01:34:48.821
[heavy breathing]

01:34:48.855 --> 01:34:51.202
[screaming]

01:35:04.906 --> 01:35:07.253
[splashing]

01:35:28.964 --> 01:35:31.967
- Georgie, Georgie,
I activated it.

01:35:32.002 --> 01:35:34.038
I activated it, I
reached the repeater

01:35:34.073 --> 01:35:35.764
and activated the fucking SOS.

01:35:35.799 --> 01:35:37.110
So they're gonna come.

01:35:37.145 --> 01:35:38.387
Hey, hey.

01:35:38.422 --> 01:35:39.941
They're gonna come,
all right, this time.

01:35:39.975 --> 01:35:41.528
And they're gonna figure out how

01:35:41.563 --> 01:35:43.082
to turn this fucking thing off.

01:35:43.116 --> 01:35:46.533
We gotta go, we gotta meet
'em at the force field.

01:35:46.568 --> 01:35:47.465
Georgie, we gotta.

01:35:51.918 --> 01:35:53.023
What are you?

01:36:02.308 --> 01:36:05.069
[warped talking]

01:36:48.388 --> 01:36:52.116
[crickets chirping]

01:36:52.151 --> 01:36:53.290
[yelling]

01:36:53.324 --> 01:36:55.499
[panting]

01:37:08.408 --> 01:37:09.651
What?

01:37:09.685 --> 01:37:12.136
Where's the repeater?

01:37:12.171 --> 01:37:14.518
[squishing]

01:37:20.696 --> 01:37:23.182
[eerie music]

01:38:35.219 --> 01:38:38.222
[light piano music]

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:58.475
[dark instrumental music]

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:33.871
[water rippling]

01:42:38.117 --> 01:42:41.016
[warped breathing]
