WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.912
- Hey, best man.
- I might go with "best person."

00:03.971 --> 00:06.281
Is this about Mom again?
I told you, I'm fine.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.842
I was just a little sad for you.

00:07.908 --> 00:10.718
Mom's a no-show,
and you and Dad are hardly even speaking.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.816
- I'm leaving you.
- Not if I leave you first.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.292
What did you do?

00:15.349 --> 00:19.422
Attention! Attention, please.
The fire has jumped the freeway.

00:21.489 --> 00:25.164
Wait, wait, wait. if you're evacuating
the whole area, can't you do us last?

00:25.226 --> 00:28.139
I don't think you realize
how close you are to actual flames.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.436
Hello. Pepper Saltzman.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.774
Big supporter of yours.
Have all your calendars.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.313
We've waited 10 years.
Can we please have an hour?

00:35.369 --> 00:38.578
- I can give you 30 minutes.
- We could make that work.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.449
The wedding will go on,
just in a slightly pared-down version.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.922
Claire, you're up front. Flower girl strewing.
Grooms, come with me.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.959
"Ooh! Ahh! They look so handsome!"

00:47.014 --> 00:48.755
Quartet, quartet, quartet!

00:48.816 --> 00:51.456
And cue Sal. Start after your limerick.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.693
- Oh, God, no!
- We're all making sacrifices, dear.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.031
I have a Prius
full of monarch butterflies...

00:57.091 --> 00:59.002
who are apparently coming home with me.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.801
No! Her water broke!

01:00.861 --> 01:03.705
No! No, it did not! I am barely pregnant!

01:03.764 --> 01:07.041
Thank you all for being here
on this joyous occasion.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.513
"There once was a homo named Tucker"-

01:09.570 --> 01:11.948
- Sal, stop. No, you're going into labor.
- Also, just stop.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.543
But we've only been together
four months.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.282
I just love you so much,
I can't wait to have your baby.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.448
- Kids ruin everything.
- Yeah, they sure do.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.358
- Let's get you to the hospital and
have our miracle baby. - Okay.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.626
Just so you know,
sometimes when babies come this early-

01:26.687 --> 01:28.189
- Uh-huh?
- they're black.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.134
Okay, this is a disaster!
We have no one to marry us.

01:31.192 --> 01:34.469
Dearly beloved, that is a problem.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.668
Yep. Thanks to $35 and the internet...

01:37.731 --> 01:41.076
you are looking at the good
Reverend Philip Humphrey Dunphy.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.979
Over the last year, I've dropped
a few subtle hints to Mitch and Cam...

01:44.038 --> 01:45.540
that I was available.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.916
Hey, have you guys decided
who's gonna officiate your wedding?

01:47.975 --> 01:50.216
- 'Cause I got ordained online.
- Oh, my God. A wallaby!

01:50.277 --> 01:52.223
Oh, my gosh!

01:52.279 --> 01:54.486
To be continued!

01:54.548 --> 01:57.154
Phil, you're a lifesaver. Thank you.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.822
No thanks necessary.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.560
Cameron, marrying you would make me
the happiest man on earth.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.862
Uh-huh.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.994
Everyone, attention, please!

02:05.059 --> 02:09.530
I've been informed by the fire chief
we need to leave immediately.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.099
The winds have shifted.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.667
- What?
- We have 30 minutes!

02:12.733 --> 02:14.974
A fellow wedding facilitator
has informed me...

02:15.035 --> 02:17.311
a beautiful space just became available.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.873
To the shuttles!

02:18.939 --> 02:20.612
But we don't know a thing
about this place.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.621
Oh, my mistake. Let's go over it.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.886
It's a quaint, rustic spot,
though its chief selling point is...

02:26.947 --> 02:29.553
it's not about to become a kiln!

02:29.617 --> 02:31.528
To the shuttles!

02:32.253 --> 02:34.130
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:34.188 --> 02:36.225
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:36.290 --> 02:38.327
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:38.392 --> 02:40.303
♪ Hey, hey♪

02:40.361 --> 02:41.533
♪ Hey,♪♪

02:43.931 --> 02:46.502
Cam, where are the shuttles that brought
everyone up from the parking lot?

02:46.567 --> 02:49.241
Apparently they were double booked.
This is the best Pepper could do.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.214
This is how
we're getting everyone to the wedding?

02:51.272 --> 02:54.549
Half our guests are gay. We're finally
giving them a good memory on a school bus.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.246
That doesn't look completely sewn on.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.620
- You might wanna get something to cover that.
- Oh, good idea.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.181
Thank you.

03:00.247 --> 03:03.387
What did you say to Merle
that make him want to leave Barb?

03:03.450 --> 03:05.327
I have no idea.
We were shooting the breeze-

03:05.386 --> 03:08.458
wedding day, Dede,
how happy I am now that I'm with you.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.331
Why would you say something like that?

03:10.391 --> 03:12.496
Now you're breaking somebody's heart.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.130
I didn't mean for her to get hurt.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.072
Not her. Him, when he realizes...

03:16.130 --> 03:19.077
that not every second wife
looks like this.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.670
Thank you for lending me your jacket, Jay.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.773
It's good to know
there are still gentlemen in the world.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.340
Oh, it's you, Barb.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.910
I didn't see you there
on account of my bright future.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.588
Thank you, Gloria.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.649
Standing up
to that old goat is the best thing I ever did.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.353
What's all that about?

03:36.417 --> 03:39.887
No, no. The thing is
that she told me a story about a goat...

03:39.954 --> 03:43.026
- and it's very old, and then the goat-
- Oh, don't give me that.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.900
I told her to express herself.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.940
I believe that in a good marriage,
a woman can ex-

03:47.995 --> 03:50.271
Fine. Whatever. I'll undo it.

03:50.331 --> 03:54.871
We can't let Cam know
what the situation with his parents is.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.211
He's very delicate.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.912
I can't believe I'm involved
in breaking up yet another marriage.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.421
What?

04:03.477 --> 04:06.219
- Hey, hey. How you holding up?
- Uh, I've had better days.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.021
But you and me, we're cool, right?

04:08.082 --> 04:09.925
We probably have some things
that we should talk about...

04:09.984 --> 04:11.691
but maybe we save it
for a less stressful day.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.733
This is not your fault, by the way.
The fire was an act of God.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.596
Not that God sent a fireball down...

04:16.656 --> 04:19.365
to keep a couple guys
from getting married, but, uh-

04:19.426 --> 04:21.702
I didn't say that right.
There's no way that this-

04:21.762 --> 04:23.742
any of this- is part of God's plan.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.299
Save something for the toast, Dad.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.073
Damn it.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.171
Where do you want this?

04:29.236 --> 04:30.977
Bus five.
What's wrong with your voice?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.915
The three of us just took a road trip.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.476
We sang Broadway tunes
all the way to the Texas border.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.546
Then from the other side of Texas
to Florida.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.885
Hey, so you're, like, the minister?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.623
Kinda. When they lost Sal,
the situation was a no-brainer...

04:44.685 --> 04:46.187
which made them think of me.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.199
Isn't there a lot you have to remember
to marry people?

04:48.255 --> 04:50.428
Not really.
They all follow the same basic pattern.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.937
"We're gathered here today
to join these two in holy matrimony.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.904
Do you take him to be
your lawfully wedded spouse?"

04:54.962 --> 04:56.600
- And the first person says-
- "I do"?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.302
Right. Then I ask the second person...

04:58.365 --> 05:00.072
"Do you take him to be
your lawfully wedded spouse?"

05:00.134 --> 05:01.636
- You know the drill, right?
- I do.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.046
Then I say, "By the powers vested in me
by the State of California...

05:04.104 --> 05:05.606
I now pronounce you legally wed."

05:05.673 --> 05:08.119
- Bingo, bango, bongo, you're married.
- Awesome.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.280
Really awesome.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.096
Look, Barb,
I know what you're going through.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.894
You and Merle are at a crossroads
in your marriage.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.797
It feels like the end of the world.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.733
But in time, you'll see it more as a-

05:24.792 --> 05:26.294
Right.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.704
Little hiccup that we all go through.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.038
don't do anything.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.635
Just take some time and breathe.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.838
Maybe through your nose.

05:36.904 --> 05:40.010
Did you happen to find anything
in one of my pockets?

05:40.074 --> 05:42.054
Funny you should flask.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.919
Maybe I'll just take that.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.255
Excuse me.
Well, it's much lighter now, isn't it?

05:49.316 --> 05:50.556
Yeah.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.961
Okay, this is weird.
I think this is the same seat...

05:53.020 --> 05:56.297
- I used to nervously scratch at on my way to school.
- Oh, poor thing.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.860
Yeah. Even then I felt
such pressure to be perfect-

05:58.926 --> 06:01.133
Andy's flight is delayed again.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.436
Okay. That was close.
We almost connected on a human level.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.738
He's doing the dumbest thing.
His girlfriend broke up with him...

06:05.799 --> 06:08.006
and he's flying out to win her back.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.570
That sounds so romantic.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.742
It's so weak.
This girl throws a fit, he goes running.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.151
If they get back together,
she has all the power.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.747
Oh, my God. You like him.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.314
No, I don't. What?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.520
This is so hilarious.
He's totally not your type.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.085
- Shut up.
- Please.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.392
You can't stop thinking about him.
You're checking on him.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.297
He's not even like a real person.
He's like a Muppet.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.897
I don't even get
some of Sal's remarks here.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.462
"Marriage is like a freeway-

06:34.528 --> 06:36.769
messy, but if you communicate,
it's so worth it."

06:36.830 --> 06:40.573
- Honey, that does not say "freeway."
- Oh.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.444
I can't use any of this, but I don't want
the whole ceremony to be generic.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.279
There needs to be some magic in it.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.341
- Well, you can read a poem or maybe-
- Hold on. Back up.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.911
- I like your last idea- a magic trick.
- I did not suggest a magic trick.

06:49.977 --> 06:53.049
After all, what's better than magic
to symbolize the wonder of marriage?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.158
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.254
Yeah, yeah. They looked good on you
in the store, but now you're not sure.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.321
That was the topic 10 minutes ago.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.959
Well, maybe if I stapled the sports page
to my head, you'd pay attention.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.662
As long as it covered your mouth.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.706
- What?
- Nothing.

07:09.396 --> 07:13.401
- Oh! When are we going to be there?
- Soon, honey. Very soon.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.003
Come on. Give us a smile.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.845
Remember, this is the happiest day
of your dads' lives.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.386
- No!
- The butterflies are eating me!

07:21.442 --> 07:23.183
Well, who told you to jostle the crate?

07:23.243 --> 07:24.745
One got in my mouth.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.849
What a bunch of babies.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.466
Pepper said it was nice.
I hope we like it.

07:34.521 --> 07:38.230
Cam. Cam, listen. Whatever's on the other side
of this curtain, we cannot be disappointed.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.432
You're right. Today is not about flowers
or superficial things.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.532
Right. Okay.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.270
- Thank God. it's pretty.
- Oh, my God. I love it.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.834
- I was so scared!
- I could cry!

07:46.900 --> 07:48.402
Oh, don't cry. You'll streak your bronzer.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.244
Everyone, please take your seats.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.342
We'll be starting in cinco minutes,
10 at the most.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.853
Do you ever notice with Ronaldo
how his language barrier sort of fluctuates?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.513
How is this place even available?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.080
Oh, dreadful story.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.389
Runaway bride,
suicidal groom, feuding families.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.827
It really puts our mundane problems
in perspective.

08:04.885 --> 08:08.355
- We can't dim the lights.
- Then break some. These are not young men!

08:09.756 --> 08:12.259
Why don't you two go freshen up?

08:12.326 --> 08:14.772
Wait. Why am I seeing
only half a quartet?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.399
- Ed and Jim are volunteer firemen.
- Of course they are.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.501
Try to play in front of a mirror.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.579
- A kiss for luck.
- Oh, okay.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.278
- A kiss for luck, my little gingersnap!
- Oh, okay. Oh, wow, Barb.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.252
Good thing
we're out of the fire zone. Wow.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.552
Well, you know,
your dad gave me a little wedding helper.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.115
I didn't know the jacket still had a-

08:34.181 --> 08:36.024
Flask. Yeah. Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.994
At the end of the ceremony, I kiss a man...

08:38.051 --> 08:40.258
so you might wanna fill 'er up.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.231
This is how you try to fix things?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.893
You get her drunk?

08:43.957 --> 08:46.130
Don't blame him.
She's been a loose cannon...

08:46.193 --> 08:49.663
ever since she started goin'
to that church service that starts at 10:30.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.334
They play guitar music.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.900
It's a celebration.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.502
It's Gomorrah.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.777
The pastor wears
one of them Madonna microphones.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.445
Oh, Madonna microphones.
Where's my little corn silk?

09:01.508 --> 09:03.920
Hey, you wanna go
and do something fun after this thing?

09:03.977 --> 09:06.548
No, I was thinking about staying in tonight
and spending some time with Joe.

09:06.613 --> 09:10.186
You never wanna do anything
since that baby came along.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.923
- How are you?
- I'm good.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.125
- You- You have the, um-
- Marriage license, rings, signing pen, toast?

09:15.188 --> 09:17.464
Yes, of course.
There's a reason I'm the best person.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.299
You know that's just
a title for today, right?

09:19.359 --> 09:20.929
Yeah. I'm the best person at this wedding.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.974
I'm still kind of hearing- What is that?

09:23.030 --> 09:25.476
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Wait. Oh.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.479
That's pollen. Oh, no.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.708
- Honey.
- Don't look at me. I only had one corsage.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.273
Where's your sister?

09:35.342 --> 09:38.653
- Haley?
- Andy! You're still here?

09:38.712 --> 09:41.886
Yeah. My flight keeps getting delayed
because of weather.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.485
So does the wedding.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.052
Wait. ls fire weather?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.859
- There was a fire?
- Yeah.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.230
Guess that explains that smoking dress.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.532
Wow. Line, Andy.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.267
Well, if you're just killing time...

09:55.329 --> 09:56.933
the new wedding venue is nearby.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.240
- You could totally come and hang.
- I don't think I'm exactly dressed for it.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.577
Of course, if I was with you,
no one would even look at me.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.241
Wow. Okay.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.911
That is quite enough pie
for you, young man.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.856
I've got to get back.

10:13.547 --> 10:16.824
Um, look, I didn't come here for coffee.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.557
Andy, I don't think it's a good idea
for you to get on that plane.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.567
- I don't think Beth is worth it.
- You don't even know Beth.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.093
I think I do. I think I've been her.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.629
Let me guess. For every 10 letters
you write, she writes one.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.370
She's always the one
who ends the phone call.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.242
You happen to mention
when your birthday's coming up...

10:35.302 --> 10:40.650
because you know deep down
she's already forgotten it.

10:40.707 --> 10:44.086
Meanwhile, she gives you just enough
to keep you on the hook.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.991
Hello?

10:49.049 --> 10:53.657
Of course I didn't leave, Mom.
You walked past me two seconds ago.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.293
I'm just saying you deserve better.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.359
Oh, my God!

10:59.426 --> 11:01.235
I'm waving at you!

11:01.294 --> 11:03.900
Stay where you are.
I'm walking towards you.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.739
Lily, here you go.
I'm taking your corsage.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.676
- But it's mine!
- You're the flower girl.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.475
It's part of your job.
Read the fine print.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.606
- Claire.
- Thank you. What?

11:10.671 --> 11:11.809
I need the rings.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.909
- For what?
- To practice our trick. Come on.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.113
Oh, honey, I don't know
about the magic trick.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.622
Don't you think people
should be focused on Cam and Mitch?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.750
I'm hoping so. it's the perfect misdirect.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.418
- Okay, here's how we're gonna do this.
- Uh-huh.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.018
- You hold the rings.
- Okay.

11:24.084 --> 11:28.999
I say, "They say the best marriages
contain just a little bit of magic."

11:29.056 --> 11:31.036
We hold up our arms.
You let go of the rings.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.661
They slide down the thread...

11:32.726 --> 11:36.503
as if mysteriously floating all the way-
half the way to me.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.973
Merle, I know that after talking to Jay...

11:42.035 --> 11:44.811
you think that there are
better things out there for you.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.976
- Who says there isn't?
- Okay.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.815
Take a trip with me to the future.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.412
It's a regular night
at the local honky-tonk.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.254
Look. Who's that man
sitting alone in the bar?

11:54.314 --> 11:56.055
it's Merle.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.959
A beautiful woman approaches.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.294
She asks, "Is this seat taken?"

12:00.353 --> 12:02.264
He says, "No."

12:02.322 --> 12:04.199
And then she grabs the chair...

12:04.257 --> 12:08.865
and sits next to a much younger,
much handsomer-looking man.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.931
Then Merle turns around
to the bartender...

12:10.997 --> 12:13.273
and say, "Happy Tuesday, huh?"

12:13.333 --> 12:18.681
The bartender replies,
"Don't you mean, 'Merry Christmas'?"

12:18.739 --> 12:20.650
You see, Merle?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.449
It was Christmas the whole time.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.547
Okay, it's showtime. Cue the processional.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.252
Phil, as they say
in my native South Carolina...

12:28.315 --> 12:30.556
it's time to marry your brother-in-law.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.393

Wedding party walking.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.694
What's that?

12:36.757 --> 12:38.361
I'll be right there.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.496
Okay. Last looks.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.633
- You look very handsome.
- Oh.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.609
This is my second favorite suit of yours.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.509
- Second?
- Right after your birthday suit.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.208
Hey. Cut it out.
I'm practically a married man.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.579
I know.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.745
You know, you scared me earlier
with what your dad said.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.415
- Wh-What?
- Well, just about the fire, you know, and-

12:58.478 --> 13:00.719
- Oh.
- being a sign we shouldn't get married.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.658
- It was kind of apocalyptic-y.
- No.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.663
- And the sky turned dark.
- Yeah, because of the fire.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.199
Well, and then we had a flood.
You know, Sal- sploosh.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.202
I think you're stretching
just a little bit.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.965
Because we paid for this room!

13:13.026 --> 13:16.439
Mr. and Mrs. Lucas, we just need
20 minutes. Cut the boy soprano.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.442
No, we need these people out of here.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.502
I can see you want to run again,
don't you? Follow your heart.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.448
On your mark, get set, live, baby.
You don't need that!

13:25.505 --> 13:29.009
You don't see this as another biblical sign?
A swarm of Lucases.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.555
Slight change, everyone! Don't worry!

13:31.611 --> 13:35.058

13:40.453 --> 13:42.592
Oh, if that thing is coming in...

13:42.656 --> 13:45.466
we need to put a few more people
on the lawn.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.061
- Okay, this place is cozy, right?
- Yeah.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.902
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's fine.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.908
Oh, it's going to be fine.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.241
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Although we may need to sit some of the overflow guests upstairs.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.747
- Oh, we don't- we don't own the upstairs.
- Really?

13:56.803 --> 13:59.750
I always assumed there was a nicer part
you weren't showing me.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.247
Make sure their checks have cleared.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.154
Just get another caterer here...

14:08.215 --> 14:10.627
or these people will be
eating butterfly bisque.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.097
Okay, I'm trying to remain calm, but you realize
that's another sign of the apocalypse, right?

14:14.154 --> 14:17.363
- Famine?
- He sounds as bad as Steven, Stefan and Longinus.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.064
Oh, so what you're saying
is we have four hoarse men?

14:20.126 --> 14:22.834
Stop with the frowning.
Today, you smile for your son.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.603
Tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.508
Tomorrow, I might just move out.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.810
Oh, now I feel a smile coming on.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.408
Oh, my God. You're texting Andy now?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.249
I'm just letting him know
he can hang out here if he wants.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.155
- Haley, I hope you know what you're doing.
- I'm not doing anything.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.217
I mean, it's one thing
if you're actually into him...

14:43.283 --> 14:46.093
but if you're just
playing around with him for the fun of it-

14:46.152 --> 14:50.066
Here's the thing about nice,
quiet dorks like Andy.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.366
You get over us much faster
than we get over you.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.832
Hi. Sorry.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.573
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:03.637 --> 15:06.880
I don't mean to rush you, but there's like
80 people waiting to get in here.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.442
No, no, no. I'm so glad you're here.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.454
- I just worked up a new magic trick.
- Oh.

15:10.510 --> 15:15.687
I start by saying, "They say the best marriages
contain just a little bit of magic."

15:15.749 --> 15:18.491
Then, in my sleeves,
I've rigged two confetti poppers...

15:18.551 --> 15:20.326
- that I found in Lily's closet.
- Mmm.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.163
So when I raise my arms-

15:23.223 --> 15:24.896
Really? You're not gonna say,
"Don't do that"?

15:24.958 --> 15:27.529
No. No, I mean,
I don't think you need the magic trick...

15:27.594 --> 15:30.336
but if you do it,
I'm sure you'll be great.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.501

15:50.150 --> 15:52.357
- What's up?
- Oh, nothing

15:52.419 --> 15:55.628
Hey, that thing you said before
about me deserving better...

15:55.689 --> 15:58.226

15:58.291 --> 16:01.295
You weren't thinking
of anyone in particular?

16:01.361 --> 16:05.366
Yeah. No, I-
I just meant you deserve to be happy.

If not, great.

is just figuring out what you want.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.247
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Well, enjoy the wedding

16:15.308 --> 16:17.083

16:17.143 --> 16:20.215

16:36.896 --> 16:39.502
Ah, you know how touchy he can be, Dede.

16:39.566 --> 16:44.106
Remember when we tried to cheer him up
after his first ice-skating competition?

16:44.170 --> 16:48.277
How were we supposed to know
third place is a good thing?

16:48.341 --> 16:51.948

across that muddy field in his skates?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.753

came home from the hospital...

19:06.379 --> 19:09.690
in a very unfashionable white diaper...

of scraggly Raggedy,Andy,hair.

If he's doing it, I'm doing it.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.566
- You comin', Barb?
- You old sweet talker.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.572
Wait for me.

19:23.563 --> 19:29.138
We were inseparable.
I was his big sister, his big brother...

19:29.202 --> 19:32.740
his nemesis, his protector...

19:32.805 --> 19:34.478
his best friend

19:36.042 --> 19:38.318
I was his first partner...

19:38.378 --> 19:40.824
and I loved every minute of it.

19:40.880 --> 19:45.090
Thank you all for being here
on this happy occasion.

19:45.151 --> 19:49.964
They say the best marriages
contain just a little bit of magic.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.065
Believe me. I know.

19:57.130 --> 20:00.009
We're gathered here today
to join two amazing people.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.205
So naturally, I was a little picky..

20:02.268 --> 20:05.477
When it came to who was
going to be replacing me...

20:05.538 --> 20:07.484
and then I met this Cam.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.613
And sure, he was warm
and funny and loving

20:14.847 --> 20:17.157
Cameron, do you take Mitchell
to be your husband?

20:17.217 --> 20:19.197
I do.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.256
Cameron, would you please place this ring
on Mitchell's finger?

20:23.957 --> 20:26.631
Mitchell, do you take Cameron
to be your husband?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.264
I do.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.572
Then by the powers vested in me
by the State of California...

20:32.632 --> 20:35.909
I am privileged to pronounce you
spouses for life.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.143
You may now kiss your husband.

20:45.445 --> 20:49.484
I wondered was he really everything
I wanted for my brother?

20:49.549 --> 20:53.656
Was he really the best person?

20:53.720 --> 20:56.394
No. I'm the best person.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.604
And now I am very pleased
to raise a glass...

21:02.662 --> 21:06.701
and introduce for the first time ever-
on our fourth try-

21:06.766 --> 21:09.975
great husbands, Mitch and Cam.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.515
Yes!

21:25.618 --> 21:27.689
- I saw that.
- What?

21:27.754 --> 21:29.256
The way you look at my sister.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.359
- You do it all the time, you know.
- I do not.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.030
Just not in front of me, okay?

21:34.093 --> 21:36.403
So, have you heard from your dads
on their honeymoon?

21:36.462 --> 21:37.964
You must really miss them, don't you?

21:38.031 --> 21:40.910
- Sorry. I was being dramatic.
- No, you were right.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.140
- You'll hate yourself.
- Right again.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.546
It's like they never left.
