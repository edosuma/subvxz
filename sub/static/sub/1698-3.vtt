WEBVTT

00:03.890 --> 00:08.280
There it is. Rack of lamb
with a mint rosemary pasta.

00:08.690 --> 00:13.440
You know back in high school I kissed a
girl named Rosemary Pasta. She could've used a mint.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.660
Her breath was very bad.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.130
Oh my gosh, that totally
reminds me of when I kissed...

00:21.190 --> 00:24.990
Nobody. Absolutely nobody.
I didn't kiss anyone.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.670
I love our relationship.

00:27.670 --> 00:31.670
You pretend you don't kiss boys...
and I pretend I believe you.

00:34.510 --> 00:37.230
Join me tomorrow on Tasty
Treats with Duncan Keats

00:37.390 --> 00:41.340
where my special guest will be Will
Smith and a very unlucky turkey.

00:50.980 --> 00:54.800
I get so beyond that so.
I know Tasty Treats.

00:56.330 --> 01:01.940
Mile, don't talk with your mouth full,
you're getting pickled butter all over my comics.

01:02.070 --> 01:05.400
- Sorry.
- I can't even read Garfield's thought bubbles.

01:08.410 --> 01:11.980
I know dad - the
girl eats like a pig.

01:13.220 --> 01:15.140
You must be so disappointed.

01:15.610 --> 01:18.610
With a son like you,
a man learns to live with it.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.420
Ah, I got a peanut chunk
stuck in my tooth.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.390
Well why don't you go
upstairs and get some floss?

01:26.710 --> 01:30.290
Why would I do that when I've got
a perfectly good fork right here?

01:31.490 --> 01:33.400
Mile, don't do that,
you're gonna' hurt yourself.

01:33.470 --> 01:38.630
I am not. I think I'm old enough to get
a peanut chunk out of my tooth alone.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.260
Mile --

01:46.270 --> 01:49.870
- The fork is stuck in your teeth, isn't it?
- No!

01:50.380 --> 01:51.070
help me!

01:54.740 --> 01:57.640
Mile, let me help you with
that before you crack a tooth.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.970
No, I am not going
to crack a tooth!

02:02.920 --> 02:04.730
But she might lose a filling!

02:09.110 --> 02:12.290
HANNAH MONTANA

03:03.720 --> 03:07.800
Yeah, Tim, I really sorry buddy, I was
looking forward to playing on your album too but...

03:07.870 --> 03:10.650
I gotta take my baby girl to
the dentist this afternoon.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.240
Alright buddy,
I'll talk to you later, bye.

03:14.300 --> 03:17.520
I cannot believe this.
He just told Tim McGraw I'm a baby.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.270
Dad! I am gonna be twenty one in...

03:21.250 --> 03:22.670
six years!

03:23.560 --> 03:27.270
Oh, so much math for
such a widdle girl!

03:29.120 --> 03:30.240
Shut up!

03:30.600 --> 03:33.600
Dad, I am totally capable of
going to the dentist without you.

03:37.890 --> 03:41.390
You... to the dentist...

03:43.180 --> 03:44.810
without dad?

03:47.550 --> 03:49.120
That is not funny,

03:49.290 --> 03:52.220
Jackson. I perform in front of
thousands of people without him...

03:52.310 --> 03:55.670
I can sure as heck go to
the dentist without Dad.

04:05.770 --> 04:08.030
If you love me,
you'll never let him back in.

04:08.820 --> 04:12.240
Now darlin', I see how fast you're
growing up, and I'm proud of you.

04:12.350 --> 04:15.410
But we both know how scared
you get at the dentist.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.690
Dad! That's when I was a kid.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.529
I was talking about last month.

04:22.610 --> 04:26.590
Just relax, honey. Dr. Cuddly Cats
is just going to clean your teeth.

04:27.830 --> 04:31.500
OK, sweetie, open your "meow-outh".

04:32.670 --> 04:35.740
Come on sweetie, you heard him.
Say "meow".

04:36.660 --> 04:37.300
come on

04:38.170 --> 04:40.630
Meo.... argh!

04:41.620 --> 04:43.400
Dad, can we stop living
in the past,please?

04:43.470 --> 04:46.110
I'm gonna' be driving soon,
I'm practically an adult.

04:46.380 --> 04:51.620
And I am making an adult decision. You are
playing with Tim McGraw, and I am going to the dentist without you.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.910
That was my dinner!

05:04.600 --> 05:06.490
Hey, would you like some
mustard or ketchup with that?

05:06.610 --> 05:07.980
Oh yeah, I could use some mustard.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.190
Don't have any.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.450
- Well how about some ketchup?
- All out!

05:11.550 --> 05:14.950
- Then why did you ask?
- Well excuse me for trying to be polite!

05:17.640 --> 05:18.520
Hey guys!

05:19.700 --> 05:21.680
Lilly! How can you eat that stuff?

05:21.680 --> 05:25.910
Yeah, don't you guys know that red meat is
a major contributer to clogged arteries?

05:25.950 --> 05:29.750
Oh sorry, when we got cable, we didn't
order the "bore you to tears" package.

05:32.420 --> 05:33.440
Suit yourself.

05:34.950 --> 05:39.610
But while you're drowning in cholesterol,
we'll be down at the beach, having a healthy

05:39.840 --> 05:44.580
vege salad with green beans,
peas, and ar...

05:44.620 --> 05:45.970
- jicama
- jicama

05:49.360 --> 05:50.920
- Well come on, Oliver.
- OK ...

05:51.000 --> 05:56.130
you know what, Joannie,honey,why don't
you...why don't you go and find us a good spot and I'll grab us some drinks.

05:56.140 --> 05:57.680
- OK ... I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you more!

05:59.190 --> 06:01.780
I am so sick-a-ma of jicama.

06:02.850 --> 06:05.290
Then you shouldn't of told
Joannie you wouldn't eat meat.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.240
I did for love!

06:06.740 --> 06:10.880
Bland, tasteless...
vegetarian love.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.970
Oh, excuse me.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.320
Oh! Hot dog burp!

06:17.350 --> 06:18.480
That's so good

06:19.020 --> 06:20.200
- Get away from me!
- ok

06:21.400 --> 06:24.780
I can't believe you're doing all this for
a girl who hasn't even kissed you yet.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.120
Wow, wow, back up the
love train engineer Bob!

06:28.710 --> 06:31.230
Someone forgot to get
off at Loserville!

06:32.650 --> 06:34.570
She's taking it slow, OK?

06:34.820 --> 06:38.480
She's been burned a couple of times in the
past and...she wants to make sure I'm not a freak.

06:38.700 --> 06:39.730
Burp on me again!

06:40.470 --> 06:42.570
Yep, you are quite a catch!

06:43.120 --> 06:47.310
OK, you know what, I'm gonna' be worthy
of her trust. Alright! I can do this!

06:51.410 --> 06:52.860
Could you just...

06:53.270 --> 06:54.290
Fine!

06:56.660 --> 06:58.780
Oh yeah, that oughta'
hold me,thanks!

07:01.630 --> 07:05.030
Rico, I know that look.
Don't mess with Oliver!

07:05.120 --> 07:11.200
I'm not gonna' mess with him! In fact, I'm
gonna' change the menu to fit his specific needs...

07:14.230 --> 07:17.620
Welcome to Rico's Meat mania!

07:17.750 --> 07:20.560
All meat, all the time.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.610
Just for you.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.240
Oh yeah.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.000
It's the promised land!

07:31.600 --> 07:34.340
- Oliver, what's the matter?
- I dropped a contact meat.

07:34.530 --> 07:37.390
lens.a contact lens.

07:37.580 --> 07:40.840
Let's walk the other flav-way,
Let's walk the other way

07:44.790 --> 07:46.380
- Oliver?
- Yes dear.

07:56.990 --> 08:00.660
- You know what the best part of having you as a sister is?
- No, what?

08:00.730 --> 08:03.330
I was hoping you could tell me,
cause I got nothing!

08:04.660 --> 08:08.150
So what, you had to drive
me here! Quit whining!

08:08.530 --> 08:12.260
Just be happy we finally found you a
chair where your feet touch the ground.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.390
I hope they run out of Novocain.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.530
- Thanks a lot!
- Sorry!

08:25.620 --> 08:28.180
Don't worry about it, sweetie,
he makes all the girls cry.

08:30.340 --> 08:34.380
Miley! Dr. Froman is ready for you.

08:35.289 --> 08:40.460
Froman? Uh...No, see...
I think you're making a mistake.

08:40.549 --> 08:44.610
My dentist is Dr. Reynolds, you know,
about "yay" high, curly hair,

08:44.620 --> 08:46.780
always wears the kitty ears.
Says open your "meow".

08:47.180 --> 08:51.340
Oh, I'm sorry, he's "me-out" today.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.720
But Dr. Froman's subbing and
he is an excellent dentist.

08:56.710 --> 09:00.870
Um... OK...

09:01.330 --> 09:02.640
I... I can do that.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.900
Do you want me to call your daddy?

09:10.110 --> 09:13.940
OK, Molly... Open up and
lets see what we've got.

09:14.100 --> 09:17.230
Wow, wow, wow! It's Miley, and um,

09:17.990 --> 09:19.780
how about we get to
know each other first?

09:19.790 --> 09:21.360
Fine, I'm a dentist, open up!

09:21.460 --> 09:25.890
No, no, no! Ar... how long
have you been a kids dentist?

09:26.010 --> 09:29.750
About forty-five minutes,
now can we get on with this, Milred?

09:30.310 --> 09:31.560
It's Miley.

09:31.700 --> 09:37.310
We're never gonna' see each other again,
who cares? Now open!

09:37.630 --> 09:41.000
OK, um...  how's this?

09:41.460 --> 09:42.870
It's not open.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.390
Really? Yeah,
I'm getting' air through it.

09:46.570 --> 09:52.140
Listen,I can see that you're nervous,
if it's any comfort, I am nervous too.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.500
I don't have kids!
Never really got the appeal.

09:55.630 --> 10:01.940
But since we're both here,
let's... get down, get funky.

10:04.810 --> 10:05.360
What?

10:06.430 --> 10:08.760
I'm trying to be relatable!

10:09.370 --> 10:11.140
To what, the nineteen seventies?

10:11.980 --> 10:13.590
Look Matilda -

10:14.190 --> 10:19.700
if you'd rather see Dr.
Reynolds tomorrow, I wouldn't mind.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.730
In fact, I'd be overjoyed!

10:21.790 --> 10:25.000
No! I have to do this,
I'm not a child anymore.

10:26.940 --> 10:32.700
But if wearing Dr. Reynolds kitty ears
makes you less nervous... that's cool.

10:33.720 --> 10:39.490
If it'll get us done, I'll wear
a hula skirt and a coconut bra.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.470
The kitty ears are fine, thank you.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.550
Here we go.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.580
Perfect. Purr-fect.

10:50.770 --> 10:53.560
Now, let's try this again.

10:53.990 --> 10:57.360
Aren't you gonna' say,
"let's see those purr-ly whites?"

10:57.830 --> 11:01.480
Fine, "lets' see
your pearly whites".

11:02.420 --> 11:04.020
No, it's purr.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.190
like a kitty! Purr!

11:06.290 --> 11:08.510
- Purr.
- Purr. Roll your tongue up.

11:11.350 --> 11:14.420
With the little... Let's
see those "purr-ly" whites.

11:15.220 --> 11:18.670
OK! You need to come back tomorrow.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.810
No! Please, I told my daddy
I could do this without him.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.190
I can't go home until
my tooth fixed.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.920
Please, Dr. Froman.
look, open wide, come on in!

11:29.280 --> 11:30.700
OK...

11:33.760 --> 11:36.590
I'm just going to
numb you up a bit...

11:37.760 --> 11:40.170
You may feel a slight pinch.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.190
Yeah, right! Nice meeting you!

11:47.730 --> 11:49.100
You too, Mabel.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.240
- Owwww ...
- Owwww ....

11:58.780 --> 12:01.930
- Owwww ...
- Owwww ....

12:01.960 --> 12:04.980
- Lilly ...
- Lilly ...

12:05.830 --> 12:07.350
I am the one in pain here!

12:07.600 --> 12:11.600
You think it's easy seeing you like this?
Think about someone else for a change, gosh!

12:12.110 --> 12:16.640
I know, I am just so selfish.
Shooting pain does that to a person!

12:17.180 --> 12:20.450
Miley, you're not going to be able to keep
this from your dad, you might as well just tell him.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.090
- I can't! ow!
- ow!

12:22.100 --> 12:23.270
- Stop it!
- Sorry.

12:24.550 --> 12:28.770
I already made a huge deal about how
I could go to the dentist alone.

12:28.900 --> 12:32.560
If he finds out that I didn't get my tooth
fixed, he's going to think that I got scared and ran out.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.100
But you did get scared and run out!

12:34.120 --> 12:36.620
I did not run I walked
quickly and with purpose.

12:37.630 --> 12:41.630
Are you kidding? She ran out there so fast
she left skid marks on a couple of five year olds!

12:41.690 --> 12:48.250
Hey! That is only because I got stuck
with doctor "Let's get down, get funky"

12:48.670 --> 12:53.370
Tomorrow I'm gonna' go to my dentist Dr.
Reynolds, get my tooth fixed, and Dad will never know.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.530
Oww!

12:56.710 --> 12:58.660
You did that on purpose!

12:58.730 --> 13:01.080
No,Sometimes I just get lucky.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.200
Your dad's home.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.050
Quick! Get rid of this ice pack!

13:06.410 --> 13:07.010
What?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.540
Oh, chilly on the Lilly.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.860
There's my big girl! How did it go?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.610
Ar... easy peasy, lemon squeezy!

13:20.150 --> 13:25.130
Well I gotta' say I'm a little surprised...
and a whole lot proud!

13:25.750 --> 13:29.540
- Good for you bud, Good for you!
- Thank-you daddy.

13:29.930 --> 13:31.490
I'm feeling the love.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.680
Well I'm glad everything worked out,
cause now I got a surprise for you.

13:35.970 --> 13:41.590
Guess what teen pop sensation is gonna' be
chowin' down with Duncan Keats in the morning?

13:42.200 --> 13:43.320
Ashley Tisdale?

13:43.710 --> 13:48.840
No! They had a cancellation and I know how
much you love the show so I got you in!

13:49.600 --> 13:50.210
Oh!

13:53.130 --> 13:55.710
Wo-ho! Yay... Miley!

13:56.150 --> 13:57.720
Yay... me!

13:58.210 --> 13:59.730
- Wo!
- Wo!

14:00.160 --> 14:01.230
- Wo!
- Yeah!

14:01.900 --> 14:02.910
- Wo!
- Wo!

14:02.930 --> 14:03.550
Wo!

14:13.280 --> 14:19.240
Well, well, well. If it isn't
my favorite meatless meat head!

14:21.110 --> 14:24.800
What happened? I was waiting
for Joannie and then...

14:25.950 --> 14:27.770
everything went all beefy.

14:31.170 --> 14:35.230
Oh man, Rico! Dude,
why did you do this to me?

14:35.540 --> 14:38.480
I'm rich and bored.
It's just what I do!

14:40.650 --> 14:42.260
- Oliver?
- Oh no.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.590
Oh, hey Jo ---

14:46.300 --> 14:48.690
Don't. You. Dare!

14:48.790 --> 14:50.040
How are you going to stop me?

14:50.220 --> 14:53.290
One word. Please!

14:53.330 --> 14:54.870
Alright, I got a heart.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.380
I'll give you thirty seconds
to make a run for it!

14:57.480 --> 14:58.690
Thirty seconds?

14:59.140 --> 15:02.770
You're right. Twenty. I personally,
don't think you're gonna' make it.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.600
Hello!

15:09.180 --> 15:11.310
Wow, Rico - what happened here?

15:11.810 --> 15:15.400
Don't know. Must have
been a pack of wild dogs.

15:15.850 --> 15:21.280
I'm guessing... ten...
nine... eight...

15:21.940 --> 15:24.050
So, ar... where's your boyfriend?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.610
I don't know... I was
supposed to meet him here.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.500
Really? You should call him.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.960
As a matter of fact,
I'll do it for you.

15:39.290 --> 15:40.000
Oliver?

15:40.560 --> 15:44.730
Oliver no esta en casa?"

15:46.960 --> 15:50.160
Oh hey Joannie... You found me.

15:50.200 --> 15:56.110
Now it's your turn to hide. One... two...
three... Where did Joannie go... she's still here.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.570
All right Joannie, I ate meat.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.730
I'm not proud of it... but I did it,
and I'm sorry.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.350
So you're not mad at me?

16:12.490 --> 16:18.290
You told me the truth. And that's more
important to me than whether you eat meat or not.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.410
Really? So all I have to
do is tell you the truth?

16:22.670 --> 16:23.500
Absolutely.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.650
Great!

16:26.590 --> 16:29.790
Well, your hair's greasy and would it
kill you to throw on a little eyeliner?

16:29.880 --> 16:30.930
- Don't push it.
- Yes dear.

16:35.030 --> 16:38.050
There it is. Duncan's
thirty-minute mousse.

16:38.160 --> 16:43.060
And here's a tip: you know it's done, when
you turn it over, and it can stay in the bowl.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.840
OK, here's another tip: Watch Emerald,
he knows what he's doing.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.890
Don't worry that was just a stunt mousse.
The real mousse is in the back hitting on a sweet little apple tart.

16:58.870 --> 16:59.950
Ow, that's hot!

17:02.800 --> 17:07.859
Don't go anywhere, because the incredible
Hannah Montana is coming up next. We'll be right back

17:08.410 --> 17:09.380
Can I get some ice?

17:13.660 --> 17:16.210
Oh, you're a little shiny,
let me get that for you.

17:18.339 --> 17:19.500
Oh, that's good.

17:19.599 --> 17:20.420
Oh, just a little more.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.460
- No, no, no, really, that's good.
- Just a little...

17:22.700 --> 17:24.369
- That is good!
- All done.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.660
That Duncan is funny. It makes me
wish I was a guest on the show.

17:32.470 --> 17:38.920
What a great idea! You really do deserve
a treat and I am overexposed as it is.

17:39.210 --> 17:43.080
Hannah this, Hannah that.
Even I'm sick of me.

17:43.090 --> 17:44.500
Have fun in the spotlight, see you.

17:44.570 --> 17:48.850
Oh no honey, we both know it's you
the fans want to see chopping down.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.190
I know I do!

17:55.600 --> 17:57.580
So Hannah, tell me,
what do you think?

17:57.760 --> 18:01.040
Just tell me you love it, this is TV,
nobody cares about the truth.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.160
Honestly Duncan, it is delicious.

18:06.440 --> 18:11.260
Soft, creamy, and well, delicious!

18:11.600 --> 18:15.270
You could not have made me a more
perfect dessert. I love you man.

18:15.710 --> 18:17.420
Oh well...

18:18.180 --> 18:20.940
Well, we're all done here,
thank-you...- Oh no, we're not all done,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.870
because I have you a
very special treat.

18:25.010 --> 18:33.490
And here it is. Oh, oh. Grandma Keats
Homemade toffee bar with a hard, peanut brittle shell.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.390
Or as Grandma calls it,
the Molar Masher.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.430
Chef boy are you kidding me,
say what?

18:41.160 --> 18:42.190
You're gonna' love it.

18:42.300 --> 18:45.720
Ar, you know what, actually,
I'm still loving the mousse.

18:45.930 --> 18:48.120
And it's all your fault for
making it so darn good.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.310
You don't know what you're missing.

18:56.990 --> 18:58.110
I think I do.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.230
Isn't she cute?

19:00.570 --> 19:01.620
Seriously, enough with the mousse.

19:01.660 --> 19:02.730
Hey,but I'm not done!

19:02.810 --> 19:04.270
- Yes you are.
- no,i'm not

19:04.340 --> 19:06.220
Let loose my moose!

19:18.200 --> 19:19.180
Oopsies?

19:20.950 --> 19:22.750
Eat grandma's bombe!

19:22.790 --> 19:23.960
No thank-you, I'm good.

19:25.100 --> 19:29.810
Eat grandma's bombe,Eat grandma's bombe,
Eat grandma's bombe

19:30.290 --> 19:31.610
- Eat IT!
- Yes sir!

19:34.330 --> 19:36.200
maybe just a little taste.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.720
Thank-you.

19:42.580 --> 19:49.110
Ahh!!!

19:53.730 --> 19:59.610
You know, considering what happened on the
show, it was awful nice of Duncan to loan you that frozen fish!

20:00.600 --> 20:04.040
Tell you what, when we get home,
I might just cook it up for you!

20:04.440 --> 20:05.760
Just for the halibut.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.890
halibut!

20:08.720 --> 20:11.650
Dad, just cause you say it twice,
doesn't make it funny.

20:12.690 --> 20:15.750
Well what else could I do,
you left me floundering out there!

20:16.180 --> 20:17.080
Flounder!

20:20.640 --> 20:22.860
I wish I had a
boyfriend that funny!

20:24.940 --> 20:26.150
That's my dad!

20:26.150 --> 20:30.940
I know. I was just fishin.fishin!

20:32.700 --> 20:34.080
yeah

20:34.150 --> 20:39.150
Anyhoo, uh, we're going to get that tooth
fixed honey, don't you worry about it.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.120
I'm gonna be standing in there right
beside you holding your little hand.

20:42.490 --> 20:48.320
Daddy, come on. I did not go through all
this "molar-mashing" pain to be right back where I started. You're staying out here.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.600
Miley! The Doctor is ready for you!

20:51.880 --> 20:53.910
And I am ready for him!

20:55.390 --> 20:56.560
See you later daddy.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.450
Mile...

21:01.900 --> 21:03.120
you haven't moved yet.

21:04.870 --> 21:06.360
Dang it, I am such a wimp.

21:07.070 --> 21:11.000
Oh, you're not a wimp.
You're just scared. That's OK.

21:11.450 --> 21:16.390
Remember when you were four? You were
afraid to jump in a pool... but eventually you did that.

21:16.690 --> 21:20.550
When you were eight, you were scared to
ride your bike - you eventually did that.

21:21.440 --> 21:25.370
One of these days you're going to walk
right through that door all by yourself.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.460
But just not today - that's OK too.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.030
Miley!

21:35.680 --> 21:39.120
I promise daddy, next time I
really will do this alone.

21:39.860 --> 21:43.280
don't worry about it.
Everybody grows up on their own pace.

21:45.310 --> 21:47.520
I totally destroyed
your shields, Jeremy!

21:47.600 --> 21:48.900
- Did not!
- Did to!

21:48.970 --> 21:50.320
- Did not!
- Did to!

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
Dad!

21:52.720 --> 21:53.850
Everyone?

21:54.090 --> 21:55.750
Well, a father can dream.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.470
You're a sweet young thang,

21:59.550 --> 22:00.800
and you smell so fine,

22:00.950 --> 22:02.050
you mean the world to me,

22:02.050 --> 22:03.470
I'm so happy that you're mine.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.120
Don't want no taste of
sushi or chicken pot's pie,

22:06.270 --> 22:07.550
just wanna' hear you sizzle

22:07.580 --> 22:08.870
my smoking hot rib bar.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.720
He loves meat!

22:09.960 --> 22:11.260
Say what, say what!

22:11.290 --> 22:12.300
He loves meat!

22:12.350 --> 22:13.970
Say what, say what!

22:13.980 --> 22:15.390
Some people call you fatty,

22:15.400 --> 22:16.770
but I love you just like daddy,

22:16.820 --> 22:18.010
now hop on my fork and

22:18.070 --> 22:19.590
say hello to your big daddy.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.630
Yo! Get your hands off my girl!

22:23.760 --> 22:26.040
Word!
