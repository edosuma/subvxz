00:12.286 --> 00:13.669
Come on, Chelsea.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.291
Reach. You're so close.

00:15.292 --> 00:16.946
Rae, I can't do it.

00:16.947 --> 00:19.659
Yes, you can.
Just a little bit further.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.558
Little bit
further.

00:25.573 --> 00:26.833
Almost got it.

00:30.294 --> 00:31.843
Girl, "Mocha Frost."
My favorite.

00:31.844 --> 00:33.524
Now I can look good
when I'm coming down.

00:35.177 --> 00:36.382
See you at the bottom.

00:43.887 --> 00:46.142
Ooh, maybe we should take
the long way to the locker room

00:46.143 --> 00:46.825
and avoid, you know...

00:46.826 --> 00:48.596
Yeah, the Jock Block.

00:50.578 --> 00:52.942
There is no way I'm
walking through all that

00:52.943 --> 00:53.780
looking like all this.

00:53.781 --> 00:54.848
I know.

00:54.849 --> 00:56.142
I mean, my hair's
all a mess

00:56.143 --> 00:57.823
I'm, like, really sweaty.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.702
And, FYI,
you kind of smell a little.

01:00.479 --> 01:02.302
Actually, you smell a lot.

01:04.575 --> 01:07.018
Uh, just
keeping it real, Rae.

01:07.019 --> 01:08.465
Keeping it real.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.634
Hey, Chelsea, I taught
you that phrase, okay?

01:11.635 --> 01:12.870
Don't use it against me.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.747
Look.

01:18.748 --> 01:20.447
Eddie hurt his foot.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.852
And it's rock climbing
week in gym.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.561
Think there's
a connection?

01:29.614 --> 01:30.289
Watch this.

01:30.959 --> 01:34.099
Hey, Eddie, there's, uh,
free pizza in the cafeteria!

01:34.100 --> 01:35.136
Free pizza?!

01:40.786 --> 01:43.438
I mean... ow.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.462
Eddie, it's a wall. Climb it.

01:47.463 --> 01:49.864
Hey, I don't do heights, okay?

01:49.865 --> 01:51.762
Birds got to fly,
fish got to swim

01:51.763 --> 01:53.533
and Eddie's
got to stay on the ground.

01:53.534 --> 01:54.725
Come on, Eddie.

01:54.726 --> 01:56.415
You're good in, like,
every other sport.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.894
Basketball,
baseball...

01:58.895 --> 02:01.053
Again, all on the ground.

02:06.198 --> 02:07.407
I made it!

02:09.848 --> 02:11.691
I just saw you
climb the wall, okay?

02:11.692 --> 02:13.682
You are going to make it
all the way to the top.

02:13.683 --> 02:14.648
Really?

02:14.649 --> 02:16.308
You know what this means?

02:17.953 --> 02:20.829
Glory, I'm healed!

02:20.830 --> 02:22.395
I can walk!

02:23.009 --> 02:24.578
I love that you're psychic.

02:29.195 --> 02:30.434
What's the matter,
Eddie?

02:30.435 --> 02:31.666
Afraid
of heights?

02:32.794 --> 02:35.007
I hate that she's psychic.

03:25.046 --> 03:26.278
Yep, that's me.

03:33.557 --> 03:35.022
Eddie, I said
I was sorry.

03:35.023 --> 03:35.994
Can't you
just forget it?

03:35.995 --> 03:37.461
I mean, everybody else has.

03:39.756 --> 03:42.237
Help me.
I'm frozen with fear.

03:42.238 --> 03:44.046
I need my mommy.

03:45.782 --> 03:47.248
That is so funny.

03:47.249 --> 03:48.966
Y'all sound just like me.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.073
On the real.

03:52.213 --> 03:53.604
See what you did?

03:58.078 --> 04:00.025
You know, Eddie,
on the bright side

04:00.026 --> 04:01.389
after this week,
you know

04:01.390 --> 04:03.123
wall climbing week
will be over

04:03.124 --> 04:04.713
and then everyone
will forget about it

04:04.714 --> 04:05.906
and stop teasing you.

04:06.405 --> 04:08.682
You know, until next year.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.753
That's right,
Eddie, look.

04:12.754 --> 04:14.653
They're not taking
the wall down until tomorrow.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.012
That's when I must
have seen you climb it--

04:16.014 --> 04:17.041
in gym tomorrow.

04:17.043 --> 04:18.781
All right, that's great.

04:18.783 --> 04:19.880
After tomorrow

04:19.880 --> 04:22.995
the whole school will know
Eddie Thomas is no wimp.

04:26.612 --> 04:28.137
But until then,
I think I'm going to take

04:28.138 --> 04:29.303
the back way to class.

04:32.078 --> 04:34.033
Give it up for
the vision, right?

04:35.571 --> 04:36.900
Bam.
Bam.

04:49.186 --> 04:51.936
Girl, I just had
the best vision about you.

04:51.937 --> 04:54.141
I saw you walking
down Jock Block

04:54.142 --> 04:57.233
looking fine and
all eyes were on you.

04:57.234 --> 04:59.292
Oh, really?

04:59.293 --> 05:02.063
Wow, you mean
I've got it

05:02.064 --> 05:03.289
going on?

05:05.689 --> 05:07.220
Hey, Chelsea...

05:07.221 --> 05:08.490
did I teach you
that line?

05:08.491 --> 05:09.450
Yeah.

05:09.451 --> 05:11.602
Well, we're going to have
to work on that one as well.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.500
Come on.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.456
So, where'd your folks go again?

05:16.457 --> 05:18.308
Jamaica. They're on
their third honeymoon.

05:18.699 --> 05:21.042
Oh, gosh, that's
so romantic.

05:21.043 --> 05:22.570
Uh, no,
it's not, okay?

05:22.571 --> 05:25.134
On their second honeymoon,
we ended up with my brother.

05:28.268 --> 05:29.612
Do you like having
your grandma around?

05:29.613 --> 05:30.442
Oh, yeah, she's cool

05:30.443 --> 05:31.683
but don't call her
"grandma"

05:31.684 --> 05:32.513
'cause she always says

05:32.514 --> 05:34.683
"Cookie, as long
as I've got my own teeth

05:34.684 --> 05:36.501
"and my butt's still
higher than my knees

05:36.502 --> 05:38.453
no one calls me grandma."

05:39.547 --> 05:40.942
All right, come on.

05:40.943 --> 05:41.937
Come on.

05:42.553 --> 05:43.502
Give it up!

05:43.503 --> 05:44.653
Give it up,
little man.

05:44.654 --> 05:45.837
Never!

05:47.850 --> 05:49.203
I'm going to touchÃ©

05:49.204 --> 05:50.456
your little tushy.

05:50.908 --> 05:52.242
That's your grandma?

05:52.243 --> 05:53.561
Hey, I heard that.

05:54.130 --> 05:54.777
Don't use that

05:54.778 --> 05:56.263
kind of language around here.

05:57.178 --> 05:58.508
It's Vivian.

06:02.266 --> 06:03.282
Hey, Viv.

06:03.283 --> 06:04.769
Hey, Cookie.

06:04.770 --> 06:06.247
Fight's over, little man.

06:06.248 --> 06:07.290
Here you go.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.592
Woo, did you work up

06:08.593 --> 06:09.282
an appetite?

06:09.283 --> 06:09.884
Yup.

06:09.885 --> 06:11.025
Good, 'cause
I whipped you up

06:11.026 --> 06:12.219
something
a little special.

06:14.857 --> 06:17.061
Say hello
to your great uncle Earl.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.134
Got you.

06:20.312 --> 06:21.323
You wait.

06:21.324 --> 06:22.612
I'm going to get you back.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.142
Well, bring it on, little man.

06:24.143 --> 06:25.212
Bring it on.

06:26.472 --> 06:27.366
Hey, Viv

06:27.367 --> 06:29.512
I want you to meet
my bestest friend, Chelsea.

06:29.513 --> 06:32.139
Oh, nice to meet you, Chelsea.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.697
Yeah, she has
a date with destiny.

06:33.698 --> 06:35.454
Well, hey,
a date's a date.

06:35.455 --> 06:38.342
Honey, we got to get you
out of that plaid

06:38.343 --> 06:39.812
and into something bad.

06:39.813 --> 06:41.448
Here you go.

06:42.634 --> 06:43.847
Voila.

06:43.848 --> 06:45.922
Wow, all my grandma
carries in her purse

06:45.923 --> 06:48.104
are old mints
and used tissues.

06:48.613 --> 06:49.744
Well, you never know

06:49.745 --> 06:51.412
when they're going to ask you
to put on a...

06:51.413 --> 06:54.023
Show!

06:57.948 --> 06:59.779
Okay, time to get you dressed.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.890
Do you
like these boots?

07:00.891 --> 07:02.192
Oh, I love those.

07:02.193 --> 07:03.844
Good, I think I wanted
to wear these tomorrow.

07:04.451 --> 07:07.612
Um, these are the ones
that I saw you in, girl.

07:07.613 --> 07:09.901
The Jock Block
is going to love them.

07:09.902 --> 07:11.029
Wait a minute.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.143
How 'bout a hat?

07:12.806 --> 07:14.042
I wore this
little number

07:14.043 --> 07:16.019
when I sang
for the troops.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.584
Wow, the Army?

07:17.585 --> 07:18.977
Nope, the Cub Scouts.

07:18.978 --> 07:22.678
Honey, I was one
hot-looking den mother.

07:26.495 --> 07:27.681
Hey, Viv.

07:27.682 --> 07:28.177
Yeah?

07:28.178 --> 07:29.043
Yeah, come back.

07:32.805 --> 07:34.856
I've got to get Chelsea
into a fly outfit.

07:34.857 --> 07:36.883
I love when Raven
has her visions about me.

07:36.884 --> 07:38.695
Oh, I remember
when she was a baby.

07:38.696 --> 07:40.824
She used to stop
and stare into space

07:40.825 --> 07:43.839
with this real serious
look on her face.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.702
Oh, she was having
one of her visions?

07:45.703 --> 07:47.022
Nope, taking a poop.

07:48.464 --> 07:50.777
Her vision face
was more like this--

07:54.755 --> 07:55.920
Hey, Viv.

07:56.245 --> 07:57.874
Yeah, sharing
time's over.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.764
What do you
think of this?

08:03.953 --> 08:05.377
Viv...

08:05.378 --> 08:06.521
you look tired.

08:06.522 --> 08:07.722
Come sit.

08:08.159 --> 08:10.789
Oh, honey, that's so sweet,
but I...

08:11.676 --> 08:15.137
I think I'm going...
I'm going to sneeze...

08:20.986 --> 08:22.144
Got you.

08:34.301 --> 08:36.102
What is taking you
so long?

08:36.102 --> 08:37.277
Lacing these boots.

08:37.278 --> 08:39.453
Next time, could you
buy some with zippers?

08:39.455 --> 08:41.857
Okay, maybe this will help you
move a little faster.

08:41.857 --> 08:43.947
I was just
walking down Jock Block--

08:43.948 --> 08:45.442
three words, okay?

08:45.443 --> 08:47.389
Look ing good.

08:52.781 --> 08:54.716
Must get on...

08:57.468 --> 08:59.478
Yeah, you thought
Jordan's comeback was big?

09:00.255 --> 09:01.456
Well, in five minutes

09:01.457 --> 09:03.542
Eddie Thomas
is climbing that wall again.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.607
Go ahead, read up.

09:04.608 --> 09:06.242
Go on, read, read, read.

09:06.243 --> 09:07.274
Thomas

09:07.275 --> 09:09.271
are you sure you want
an audience for this?

09:09.689 --> 09:11.400
You bet he does.

09:11.401 --> 09:13.077
Does this look
like a man

09:13.078 --> 09:15.228
who can't take on
a challenge?

09:15.607 --> 09:17.412
That's his head,
but that's

09:17.413 --> 09:18.527
not his body.

09:20.787 --> 09:22.062
Well, does that look like

09:22.063 --> 09:25.426
the head of a man who
can't take on a challenge?

09:25.879 --> 09:28.096
Yeah, what she said.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.167
I'm so proud of you.

09:31.168 --> 09:32.255
No fear of heights

09:32.256 --> 09:33.395
is going to keep
my boy down.

09:33.396 --> 09:34.741
You know what,
I'll be there

09:34.742 --> 09:35.747
as soon as
Chelsea's finished.

09:35.748 --> 09:36.423
Good luck.

09:36.424 --> 09:37.511
I don't need it

09:37.512 --> 09:39.301
as long as I got
my psychic friend.

09:53.348 --> 09:55.907
# Here we go #

09:57.232 --> 09:59.369
# Take me higher #

10:01.309 --> 10:03.134
# Now, how about this? #

10:05.555 --> 10:07.020
# Here we go #

10:08.678 --> 10:10.930
# Take me higher #

10:25.377 --> 10:26.756
Chelsea...

10:28.548 --> 10:30.007
Walk with me,
walk with me.

10:30.008 --> 10:32.316
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

10:32.317 --> 10:33.899
Their eyes were,
like, glued to me.

10:34.411 --> 10:37.634
Yeah, and, um, so is that.

10:37.635 --> 10:38.535
What?

10:45.278 --> 10:48.497
Okay, um, please tell me
you just put this there.

10:49.499 --> 10:52.434
Well, girl,
you know you look hot.

10:53.656 --> 10:54.819
From the front.

10:57.378 --> 10:59.312
How could you do this, Rae?

10:59.313 --> 11:01.014
That was the Jock Block.

11:01.649 --> 11:02.577
Thanks a lot.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.409
No, but it's not my fault.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.778
Chelsea, it's these...
it's these stupid visions.

11:06.779 --> 11:08.648
Girl, they keep
messing up everybody.

11:08.649 --> 11:10.352
I mean, first it's Eddie
and now you.

11:12.778 --> 11:13.842
Oh, no. Eddie.

11:13.843 --> 11:15.410
Eddie.

11:24.397 --> 11:25.403
Eddie...

11:25.983 --> 11:27.272
Raven.

11:28.898 --> 11:30.247
All right, you guys,
break it up.

11:30.248 --> 11:31.184
There's nothing
left here to see.

11:31.185 --> 11:32.932
Moving on, move on.

11:32.933 --> 11:33.994
Here, let me
help you.

11:33.995 --> 11:35.109
No, I'll do it.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.559
I think you already
helped enough.

11:37.043 --> 11:38.988
Man, I'm the biggest joke

11:38.989 --> 11:40.347
in the school now.

11:40.348 --> 11:42.162
Man, your visions are whack.

11:42.163 --> 11:43.909
Why can't you just be more...

11:43.910 --> 11:45.076
Normal?

12:05.391 --> 12:06.477
Hi.

12:08.925 --> 12:10.180
You know, I was looking

12:10.181 --> 12:11.643
for you guys
in the cafeteria

12:11.644 --> 12:12.542
and then, you know,
I thought

12:12.543 --> 12:14.376
where would two people
who hate me go?

12:14.377 --> 12:15.969
And here you are.

12:15.970 --> 12:17.719
These must be
the hate-me stairs.

12:20.317 --> 12:23.112
Ooh, and those must be
the other hate-me stares.

12:23.113 --> 12:24.314
Get it?

12:24.315 --> 12:26.783
The stairs and then
the hate-me stares?

12:29.257 --> 12:29.984
Right.

12:31.232 --> 12:33.098
You guys, look

12:33.099 --> 12:35.061
what am I
supposed to do?

12:35.062 --> 12:37.062
Okay, you don't want me
to tell you my visions.

12:37.063 --> 12:37.920
What do you
want me to do?

12:37.921 --> 12:40.197
go on some type of psychic
strike or something?

12:47.973 --> 12:49.512
Sounds good to me.

12:49.513 --> 12:51.977
Yeah, no more visions.

12:51.978 --> 12:54.329
Unless a piano is about
to fall on my head.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.397
Then you can tell me.

12:55.398 --> 12:56.334
I mean...

12:57.669 --> 12:59.491
Or you can just
keep it to yourself.

13:01.324 --> 13:02.622
Okay, so...

13:03.183 --> 13:04.244
Starting today

13:04.245 --> 13:05.838
I will no longer
tell you my visions.

13:05.839 --> 13:06.705
Friends?

13:10.714 --> 13:11.512
Friends.

13:11.513 --> 13:12.682
Friends.

13:12.683 --> 13:13.655
I love y'all.

13:17.308 --> 13:18.736
If I get hit
by a piano

13:18.737 --> 13:20.039
I'm blaming you.

13:24.702 --> 13:25.465
Okay, I'm next.

13:25.466 --> 13:26.595
Which one do you think
I should sing?

13:26.596 --> 13:28.004
This one I always sing

13:28.005 --> 13:29.925
but this one has
that really high note

13:29.926 --> 13:31.457
that Vivian's been
helping me with.

13:31.458 --> 13:32.942
I think, uh...

13:35.170 --> 13:35.905
Uh...

13:35.906 --> 13:37.226
Go for
the high note, right?

13:38.453 --> 13:39.417
Your choice.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.385
Great.

13:43.095 --> 13:44.995
Hi. Chelsea Daniel.

13:48.274 --> 13:53.406
# Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound #

13:53.407 --> 14:00.981
# That saved a wretch like me #

14:24.111 --> 14:25.346
Hey, Eddie.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.438
Yeah.

14:29.488 --> 14:30.522
Never mind.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.898
Ah, there's nothing like
roasting marshmallows

15:05.899 --> 15:07.159
over a campfire.

15:09.061 --> 15:12.034
Hey, come on,
cookie, smile.

15:12.035 --> 15:13.798
You used to like camping
out in the living room

15:13.799 --> 15:15.003
when you were little.

15:15.004 --> 15:16.418
What's going
on, kid?

15:16.419 --> 15:18.225
Can we talk about it later?

15:18.226 --> 15:19.476
Sure.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.484
It's later.
Now talk.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.305
It's these visions--
I hate them.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.690
I know exactly
how you feel.

15:29.993 --> 15:31.314
No one knows
how I feel--

15:31.315 --> 15:32.746
not even my friends.

15:32.747 --> 15:35.207
Sometimes I feel like I'm
some kind of freak or something.

15:36.193 --> 15:38.593
Do you feel like if you
tell your friends your visions

15:38.594 --> 15:40.711
and it doesn't work out,
that it's all our fault?

15:41.253 --> 15:42.408
And if you
don't tell them

15:42.409 --> 15:43.654
and bad stuff
happens

15:43.655 --> 15:44.945
it's still your fault?

15:45.405 --> 15:47.025
And more than anything

15:47.026 --> 15:48.980
you just wish
you were normal?

15:50.397 --> 15:51.578
That's exactly how I feel

15:51.579 --> 15:53.301
but I've never told
anyone that before.

15:53.302 --> 15:54.518
How could you know?

15:57.418 --> 15:59.137
Grandma,
are you psychic?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.224
Well, I don't know who
this grandma person is

16:02.225 --> 16:03.452
but Viv is.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.577
How do you think I knew
what Corey was up to

16:06.578 --> 16:07.978
with his whoopie cushion?

16:09.379 --> 16:11.338
As a matter of fact,
he's on his way downstairs

16:11.339 --> 16:14.117
right now with a couple
of water balloons.

16:14.893 --> 16:17.157
Corey, don't even
think about it!

16:17.716 --> 16:18.930
Oh, man!

16:21.588 --> 16:23.339
I wish I could just stay
in this tent forever

16:23.340 --> 16:24.446
and never come out.

16:24.447 --> 16:25.578
Been there.

16:25.579 --> 16:27.365
That is not the answer.

16:29.766 --> 16:31.266
Just a minute.

16:34.688 --> 16:36.774
Got to have
my sound effects.

16:39.329 --> 16:40.545
You know, cookie

16:41.054 --> 16:42.815
being psychic is a gift.

16:43.216 --> 16:45.123
It's what makes us special.

16:45.785 --> 16:47.118
And you're
a lucky girl

16:47.119 --> 16:48.701
to have friends
you can share it with.

16:49.351 --> 16:51.737
But if I keep sharing, I'm not
going to have any friends.

16:52.296 --> 16:53.348
Cookie...

16:54.730 --> 16:56.973
good friends don't
go away that easy.

17:01.538 --> 17:02.603
Thanks.

17:03.079 --> 17:05.542
Ah, for what, sweetie?

17:06.157 --> 17:07.704
Telling me that
you're psychic.

17:08.537 --> 17:10.525
Now I know I'm not the only one.

17:11.327 --> 17:12.669
And if you ever need to talk

17:12.670 --> 17:13.954
you can always call.

17:14.307 --> 17:16.193
Of course, I'll know
it's you before I pick up.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.510
'Cause you'll
have a vision?

17:17.511 --> 17:19.284
No, I got caller ID.

17:20.953 --> 17:22.501
Get with the program, kid.

17:23.023 --> 17:24.723
And answer that phone.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.217
Hello.

17:31.423 --> 17:32.316
What?!

17:33.296 --> 17:35.352
Okay, okay,
I'll be right there.

17:35.353 --> 17:36.757
What's wrong?

17:36.758 --> 17:39.856
And you call yourself
a psychic.

17:49.996 --> 17:52.562
Eddie, what are you
doing up there?!

17:52.563 --> 17:55.249
Well, I think
I'm climbing a wall

17:55.250 --> 17:56.749
but I've got my eyes shut.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.974
Okay, I'm going
to open them now.

17:59.985 --> 18:01.485
Yep. I'm on a wall.

18:02.593 --> 18:04.621
Eddie, who are you
doing this for?

18:04.622 --> 18:05.872
Everybody's gone home.

18:05.873 --> 18:08.013
I don't care, Chels.
I'm doing this for me.

18:10.183 --> 18:12.038
Eddie, be careful.
Move slowly, okay?

18:12.039 --> 18:12.965
Okay.

18:13.931 --> 18:16.273
Okay, now, hurry. Hold on.

18:16.274 --> 18:17.271
Get it.

18:19.343 --> 18:20.943
I made it!

18:21.582 --> 18:23.079
Yay! Now come down.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.457
Yay, Eddie.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.146
That was good.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.025
That was my vision.

18:27.026 --> 18:29.077
Yeah, and I love your visions.

18:29.078 --> 18:30.763
Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em.

18:31.853 --> 18:32.861
Yeah.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.560
Man, you guys

18:34.561 --> 18:35.872
sure are tiny.

18:44.588 --> 18:45.466
Oh, we've got you.

18:45.467 --> 18:46.391
We've got you.
Don't worry.

18:51.175 --> 18:52.350
Move over, now!

18:52.351 --> 18:55.317
One, two, three!

19:05.890 --> 19:08.169
This is way better.

19:12.813 --> 19:14.166
Okay, guys, listen.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.578
The trick is to stay calm.

19:21.219 --> 19:24.619
I'll be okay as long as I stand
on this rock thing.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.852
You guys, this is
all my fault again.

19:36.336 --> 19:38.688
Listen, if you want
to drop me as a friend

19:38.689 --> 19:40.479
I totally understand.

19:40.785 --> 19:42.987
What? You just climbed
up a wall

19:42.988 --> 19:44.479
to save my butt, Rae.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.340
You don't drop friends
like that.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.539
But... I'm still
going to have visions.

19:49.540 --> 19:50.971
So what, Rae?

19:50.972 --> 19:53.289
Come on. Sure, they're going to
mess us up sometimes, you know

19:53.290 --> 19:54.739
and we're going
to get really mad

19:54.740 --> 19:56.420
and act like we hate you

19:56.421 --> 19:58.214
but, well,
that's what friends do.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.489
We're not going anywhere.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.184
Yeah. We all got our stuff.

20:03.185 --> 20:06.604
I mean, you may not
notice about me

20:06.605 --> 20:08.421
but I'm scared of heights.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.592
I feel a group hug coming on.

20:21.317 --> 20:22.458
I love you guys.

20:22.459 --> 20:24.158
Oh, man, I love you, too.

20:24.159 --> 20:25.989
I'd love to get down.
Oh...

20:31.175 --> 20:32.095
Hey!

20:32.096 --> 20:33.266
Hey, Viv!

20:33.267 --> 20:34.676
Hey, Coach.

20:34.677 --> 20:36.717
Thought I might find
you here, Cookie.

20:36.718 --> 20:37.787
How'd she know
we were here?

20:37.788 --> 20:40.312
Oh, because me and Viv,
we're like this.

20:41.978 --> 20:43.409
Can't we just leave
her up there?

20:43.410 --> 20:46.095
I mean, this is like
a dream come true.

20:46.714 --> 20:48.128
Keep dreaming,
little man.

20:48.129 --> 20:49.557
Come on, pull.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.875
Synced by MatMaggi

21:00.134 --> 21:01.454
Eddie, what do I do?

21:01.455 --> 21:03.325
Look, Rae, there's one
other thing you can do.

21:03.326 --> 21:04.472
Wait, hold on...

21:05.977 --> 21:09.255
Do you carry a lunch box?!

21:13.246 --> 21:14.839
You get right... okay.

21:15.354 --> 21:17.096
And, action.

21:17.097 --> 21:19.900
No. Mouth... mouthwash.

21:19.901 --> 21:21.133
You should keep that.

21:21.134 --> 21:23.421
He went in my shirt, oh, God.

21:24.395 --> 21:25.726
Eddie, what do I do?

21:25.727 --> 21:27.197
I'm sorry.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.362
He's in my shirt! Help!

21:31.382 --> 21:32.521
Eddie, what do I do?

21:32.522 --> 21:34.180
There's one other thing
you can do, Rae.

21:34.181 --> 21:35.384
You stop smiling!

21:35.385 --> 21:36.015
I'm...

21:37.239 --> 21:38.567
You were laughing
and smiled!

21:39.501 --> 21:41.484
Don't smile.
Okay.

21:41.485 --> 21:44.108
Do you carry
a lunch box?!

21:45.787 --> 21:48.712
Um... I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

21:50.578 --> 21:52.363
Eddie, what do I do?

21:52.364 --> 21:53.814
Look, Rae, there's
one other thing

21:53.815 --> 21:55.506
you can do-- real little.
