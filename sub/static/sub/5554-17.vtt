TOBY (mimicking):
My name's Walter O'Brien.

00:29.463 --> 00:33.799
I have the fourth highest IQ
ever recorded, 197.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.801
Einstein's was 160.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.136
(grunts tauntingly)

00:37.138 --> 00:39.738
Yes, they're both facts.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.774
But what is
he saying?

00:41.776 --> 00:44.010
Mm-hmm.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.245
I'm saying you have
a superiority complex.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.347
But I am superior.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.150
If you want your feelings
to be felt,

00:51.152 --> 00:52.785
you must use the felt.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.791
My name is Toby,
I went to Harvard.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.727
I chase Happy Quinn around
like a schoolboy.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.063
I probably wear this hat
in the shower.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.697

Just attacks the hat.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.699
Uh, forget the hat,
the hat is stupid.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.835

Walter might have

01:09.837 --> 01:12.838
some unconscious concerns
about her to bring her up now.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.490
No, very conscious.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.141
His obsession with her
affects his efficacy.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.410

friend from work.

that's "nuttin'" but a lie...

01:25.086 --> 01:26.218
(buzzing)
I didn't lie.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.719
(buzzing)
Lie by omission.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.389
You said "friend" twice,
back-to-back.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.858
Repetitive proximity pattern.

are more than friends.

But let's discuss this later.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.472
Right now, Cabe is coming in

<i> Policía Federal</i>
<i> Ministerial.</i>

04:38.045 --> 04:40.279
Mexican drug enforcement?
Sounds serious.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.814
Agreed, so I suggest that
we focus on what's important.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.950
For the record, our
love is important.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.286
Okay, shut it.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.554
Three days ago, a rancher found
this brick of heroin

04:49.556 --> 04:51.690
attached to a drone
that malfunctioned

04:51.692 --> 04:54.926
and crashed by the
Arizona border.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.762
Our sources are certain
it came from Central America,

04:56.764 --> 04:58.363
through my country and into yours.
PAIGE: Gold Mule?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.065
This is the heroin
that's been in the news?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.334
Extremely pure, very dangerous.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.803
Kids are OD'ing on this poison
all over the country.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.805
It's potent stuff.
Users are willing to pay

05:06.807 --> 05:08.807
top dollar for it, and
dealers are willing to kill

05:08.809 --> 05:11.076
for the distribution
territory here in the States.

05:11.078 --> 05:15.414
It's sparked gang wars
in Mexico City, Guadalajara,

05:15.416 --> 05:16.715
Chicago, Atlanta and Miami.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.884
Innocents are getting caught
in the crossfire.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.420
A father walking
home from work.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.422
An eight-year-old
doing her homework.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.090
Bullet came through
her bedroom window.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.625
Three blocks from my home.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.061
She was doing math.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.095
WALTER: I assume
you want our help

05:30.097 --> 05:31.897
because drones are involved.
Correct.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.566
So far we have been able
to confiscate 85%

05:34.568 --> 05:36.535
of the shipments coming
across the border.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.003
Trucks, tunnels,
airplanes.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.871
Are you telling me
all the drugs in the U.S.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.474
only account for 15%
of the potential supply?

05:42.476 --> 05:44.609
Imagine if the rest got in
via drone.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.545
Bad guys always adapt.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.013
The U.S. and our Mexican allies,

05:48.015 --> 05:49.881
we feel that the drone
was a test flight

05:49.883 --> 05:51.083
for a new delivery system.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.617
Well, drones make sense.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.019
They're small,
they're hard to spot.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.822
They don't need runways
or other infrastructure.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.557
May I?

05:58.559 --> 05:59.991
Yes, please. Up there.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.426
SANCHEZ: Heard from
an informant this morning.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.762
They're gonna try
another test run

06:03.764 --> 06:05.430
through this corridor
this afternoon.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.366
Perfect flight path.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.667
No cops or military around
for hundreds of miles.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.568
Can't radar catch them?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.487
Well, radar's designed

06:11.488 --> 06:13.405
to filter out small aerial
clutter, like birds.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.674
Drones exploit this weakness.
Single point of failure.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.143
Exactly, and if we can't figure
out how to plug this hole,

06:18.145 --> 06:20.512
we'll start getting
waves of this stuff

06:20.514 --> 06:22.781
at all hours
up and down the border.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.750
Okay, so what if
we hit the drones

06:24.752 --> 06:26.418
with a focused energy
concentration,

06:26.420 --> 06:29.054
like a pulse-gun that we built?
Surge it?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.889
The CPU would fry
or reboot.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.624
Either way, those
drones go down.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.759
SANCHEZ:
This could stop the shipments?

06:33.761 --> 06:35.761
Yeah, we'll make
a rough prototype

06:35.763 --> 06:38.697
that Homeland would then scale,
but, yes, if our device works,

06:38.699 --> 06:41.066
then drones would be
stopped at the border.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.434
Amazing.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.503
But we will only
have one shot

06:44.505 --> 06:45.837
at intercepting
this practice run.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.806
If it doesn't work,
drugs get through.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.409
So we'll have to make sure that
the gun is properly calibrated.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.479
We'll need a drone to
shoot down as a test.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.917
Oh, no, Birdroni?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.987
Yeah, better dust
off your toy, buddy.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.190
(whispering): 'Cause we're
gonna blast it out of the sky.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.160
I think I've got one and one...

07:08.162 --> 07:10.462
I think this is what Walter
wants for his pulse-gun.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.730
Rifle stock? Yep. Check.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.166

07:17.438 --> 07:18.136

07:18.138 --> 07:19.137
Uh, yep.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.140
Okay, you got to stop,
you're gonna ruin this

07:22.142 --> 07:24.609
with the whole "Quintis"
pronouncements.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.445
It was between
"Quintis" and "Tappy."

07:26.447 --> 07:27.979
And the love notes.
They're sonnets, actually.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.681
And the texts.
I don't text that much.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.651

We'll be watch buddies."

07:39.075 --> 07:41.225
I'm just excited, I finally
have everything I ever wanted.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.930
Am I interrupting something?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.199

07:47.201 --> 07:48.099

There is nothing in the desert
for you to profile

08:00.781 --> 08:02.481
apart from lizards and cacti

08:02.483 --> 08:04.749
so you're staying
here in the garage,

08:04.751 --> 08:06.551

for the radar and the comms.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.618
Hang in there, Birdroni.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.719
Be strong.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.622
Take it down.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.901
(whimpers)

09:34.708 --> 09:36.641
Gizmo works.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.343
Got to get my electronic
bird! Be okay.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.679
Please, be okay. Please, be okay.
Now we wait for the real thing.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.348
You finish juicing the
surveillance van's radar?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.350
We'll see the drone
before it sees us.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.003
How we looking, Doc?

09:48.004 --> 09:50.655
You have full comm, cell
and radar capabilities.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.691
Signal's hot, just
like my girlfriend.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.659
That's exactly
why Walter thinks

09:54.661 --> 09:56.161
your relationship
is a distraction.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.662
He might have a point.
You're siding with him?

09:57.664 --> 10:00.665
Uh, you're the one trying
to get us to be human.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.133
We finally take a step
in that direction,

10:02.135 --> 10:03.735
you think it's wrong?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.238
Toby has put missions at risk
over Happy before.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.773
It affects his judgment.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.076
You've taken risks for Paige.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.344
Yeah, and I was wrong to do so.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.163
She agrees.

10:14.164 --> 10:15.981
Why would I want my employees
to make the same mistake?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.651
Well, it's not that simple.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.652
Not that simple?

10:20.654 --> 10:21.987
You ignored Walter's orders

10:21.988 --> 10:23.321
and ran off after Happy
in a blizzard.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.657
And it worked out okay.
And we got lucky.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.959
Our missions are too
important to jeopardize.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.194
Scorpion saves lives.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.695
Including our own.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.264
Before this team, I was
a struggling waitress,

10:33.266 --> 10:34.899
Sly embezzled from a bank,

10:34.901 --> 10:36.835
and you owed
every gambler in town.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.003
We're not those people anymore.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.004
We've evolved.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.138
Team can evolve, too.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.707
Hey! Radar's showing incoming.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.842
Why aren't your comms in?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.110
We were having
a private conversation.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.277
Yeah, wonder about what.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.278
Direction?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.880
Southeast!

10:48.882 --> 10:50.815
151 degrees!

10:50.817 --> 10:53.652
Uh, Doc? You seeing this?

10:53.654 --> 10:56.688
Walter, we got a sky
full of bogies on its way.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.889
<i> This isn't a test flight.</i>

10:57.891 --> 10:58.957
<i> This is a full shipment.</i>

11:01.728 --> 11:02.927
He's right.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.896
There's scores of them
heading towards us.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.031
Let's shoot 'em down.

11:06.033 --> 11:06.998
There's no way that pulse-gun

11:07.000 --> 11:07.999
will take out all those drones

11:08.001 --> 11:09.134
before they get past us.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.669
Its field of fire
is way too narrow.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.277
It's worse than that.
The lead drone is weaponized

11:19.279 --> 11:21.079
and it has a camera
that is locked in on us!

11:21.081 --> 11:23.715
Run for it,
Sylvester!

11:23.717 --> 11:25.817
(gunfire)

11:25.819 --> 11:26.951
Ah!

11:26.953 --> 11:28.053
Happy, take cover!

11:47.207 --> 11:49.107
Pulse-gun's not
working any more.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.775
They're out of range.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.877
They're too far.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.179
Sly?

11:56.450 --> 11:57.749
Happy, you okay?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.284
Uh, yeah, we're...

11:59.286 --> 12:01.319
we're all okay.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.722
Bad guys must've
got intel

12:03.724 --> 12:05.390
that law enforcement
was onto them.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.225
Decided to rush
a shipment through.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.860
And arm it
just in case.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.262
Situation changed;
they adapted.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.999
Guys, you got
another wave inbound,

12:15.001 --> 12:16.234
few miles out.
This isn't over.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.805
Wait!

12:20.807 --> 12:22.107
We can't let them get through.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.742
Not to be defeatist,

12:23.744 --> 12:25.410
but a few shipments of heroin's

12:25.412 --> 12:27.946
a statistical drop
in the ocean for the drug wars.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.115
It's not worth us
risking our lives over.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.783
Like hell it isn't.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.485
That eight-year-old girl
doing her homework?

12:33.487 --> 12:34.986
Her name was Maria.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.424
She was in class with my son.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.992
They were friends.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.861
You see them

12:42.863 --> 12:44.262
carrying bricks of drugs;

12:44.264 --> 12:45.864
I see them carrying coffins.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.933
Gang, you're minutes

12:48.935 --> 12:50.802
from those drones
being on top of you.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.937
Okay. But the pulse-gun's
barely wide enough

12:52.939 --> 12:54.723
to take out one drone.

12:54.724 --> 12:56.508
There's no way
it'll be able to knock out 30.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.543
Best strategy
to take on an enemy

12:58.545 --> 12:59.944
with superior numbers

12:59.946 --> 13:01.479
is to force them
into a narrow pass

13:01.481 --> 13:03.014
and take 'em out one at a time.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.049
Yeah, like the Spartans
in the film<i> 300.</i>

13:05.051 --> 13:07.252
No, like John Wayne
in<i> The Alamo.</i>

13:07.254 --> 13:09.921
I don't see a narrow pass to
force the other drones through

13:09.923 --> 13:11.556
and we can't create one
out of thin air.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.926
Actually, we can.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.928
We just need

13:16.930 --> 13:18.897
a strong enough radio signal.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.865
Create a canyon out of static.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.935
The lead drone's computer
will automatically readjust

13:23.937 --> 13:26.171
to get it through
the narrow static pass.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.239
WALTER:
Right through here.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.941
What about
the rest of the drones?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.076
Based on the flight pattern
that I saw,

13:32.078 --> 13:33.878
the drug runners
have a single pilot

13:33.880 --> 13:35.914
controlling the lead drone.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.849
Now, the rest link up
to it remotely

13:37.851 --> 13:39.417
and fly in formation.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.984
Once the main drone
enters the static canyon,

13:40.987 --> 13:42.520
all the outer drones will adapt

13:42.522 --> 13:44.255
and move in closer
to the center

13:44.257 --> 13:46.424
to avoid losing
the leader's signal.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.492
We shoot down the leader,

13:47.494 --> 13:48.593
control switches over

13:48.595 --> 13:50.161
to the next drone in line.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.496
We'll nail 'em one at a time.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.099
So, Happy,
what can you build?

13:55.101 --> 13:57.168
I can broadcast
a wall of interference

13:57.170 --> 13:58.937
on either side of the flock,

13:58.939 --> 14:00.972
but you guys have to receive it
with the antenna.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.142
All right.
Let's put the squeeze on 'em.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.110
TOBY:
Here they come.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.847
Couple dozen bogies
heading your way.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.915
(drones whirring)

14:12.986 --> 14:14.919
WALTER: Okay.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.055
Fire up the radio interference.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.559
(sighs)

14:21.561 --> 14:23.027
HAPPY:
Almost ready on my end.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.131
(static crackling)
Done.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.201
Our radar's picking up
the amplified static!

14:31.137 --> 14:33.171
PAIGE:
It's working.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.873
The drones are changing course.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.217
CABE:
Remember, kid,

14:46.219 --> 14:47.652
the first one shoots back!

14:47.654 --> 14:51.623
Yeah, well, I'm shooting first.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.659
(drones whirring)

15:00.133 --> 15:01.165
We got 'em.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.433
(whoops, laughs)

15:05.272 --> 15:06.638
They're falling like stones.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.973
(laughs) Nice!

15:12.012 --> 15:14.279
WALTER:
Damn it!

15:14.281 --> 15:15.613
Walt, one just got by.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.148
Yeah, one flew
right through the beam.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.318
Where do the drug runners
get their drones?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.452
Wherever they can.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.521
Buy, build, steal.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.125
That's it, that's the last one.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.326
Now, wherever that one
came from,

15:28.328 --> 15:29.811
it has some kind of tech

15:29.812 --> 15:31.295
that makes it immune
to our pulse-gun.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.630
Once the bad guys
realize that...

15:32.632 --> 15:33.631
They'll get more of that type

15:33.633 --> 15:35.033
and will make our weapon moot.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.235
Be defenseless
all over again.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.103
Anything could be
delivered anywhere.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.338
Guys, get over here!

15:40.340 --> 15:42.307
We have to get that drone
before they do.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.708
TOBY:
Oh.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.276
We lost the drone.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.712
<i> You can't find</i>
<i> what I can't see.</i>

15:47.714 --> 15:49.280
It's too low for the radar
to pick it up now,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.281
but we're going
in the direction

15:50.283 --> 15:52.684
<i> that we saw it heading.</i>

15:52.686 --> 15:54.369
There!

15:54.370 --> 15:56.053
SYLVESTER:
Looks like it's coming in

15:56.056 --> 15:57.488
for a landing
just over that ridge.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.057
All right.
Got it.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.565
I don't know
what's up there.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.068
You mean, like,
drug runners with guns?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.703
Sanchez, you guard our six.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.439
I'm gonna go up there
and see if I can find the drone.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.108
Well, it's a big desert.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.576
Second set of eyes
couldn't hurt.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.712
Fine.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.613
Happy, you hop behind the wheel

16:22.615 --> 16:26.050
in case we have to bug out.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.033
WALTER (quietly):
Look, they're unloading drugs

16:42.035 --> 16:43.401
from the first wave
that got past us.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.236
Oh.
Yeah, over there.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.704
That's the drone
that beat our device.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.239
We gotta get
ahold of it

16:48.241 --> 16:49.741
so we can study it,

16:49.743 --> 16:51.209
figure out how
it got through.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.747
All right.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.167
I'll go get it.

16:59.168 --> 16:59.750
SYLVESTER: Are you guys
doing something dangerous?

16:59.753 --> 17:01.152
It sounds dangerous.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.637
Runners are collecting
the drones.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.121
Cabe's gonna swipe the one that
we need without them seeing.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.390
Oh, boy.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.458
(speaking Spanish)

17:13.166 --> 17:14.766
Hey!

17:14.768 --> 17:16.701
Hey, run, run!

17:16.703 --> 17:18.403
Get in, get in, get in.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.440
(gunfire)

17:25.178 --> 17:26.411
We're outgunned!

17:26.413 --> 17:28.479
(gunfire)

17:30.316 --> 17:31.749
(tires screeching)

17:31.751 --> 17:33.217
Come on!

17:33.219 --> 17:34.819
(gunfire)

17:34.821 --> 17:36.187
Come on, Walter!

17:38.458 --> 17:39.590
Walter, get back here!

17:39.592 --> 17:41.159
Sanchez, lay down cover fire!

17:46.499 --> 17:49.067
Get in! Get in!

17:51.304 --> 17:52.403
Run! Go!

17:52.405 --> 17:54.539
(tires squealing)

18:01.381 --> 18:03.181
Been a few minutes;
no one's following.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.816
CABE:
I shot out their tires.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.517
That should give us enough time
to stay ahead of 'em.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.986
At our current
rate of speed,

18:07.987 --> 18:09.454
we should reach the Arizona
Highway Patrol Post in Yuma...

18:09.456 --> 18:10.521
(gunfire)

18:10.523 --> 18:11.689
Whoa! No, no!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.291
HAPPY:
There's no car!

18:13.293 --> 18:14.392
Where are the shots
coming from?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.360
Gun drone!

18:16.362 --> 18:17.728
(gunfire)

18:17.730 --> 18:20.231
Sly, give me that pulse weapon!

18:20.233 --> 18:22.600
(gunfire continues)

18:26.473 --> 18:28.306
(clicks)

18:28.308 --> 18:29.841
There's no juice!

18:29.843 --> 18:32.276
Oh. You know what,
the power cell must be spent.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.845
We've alerted the Yuma police,

18:33.847 --> 18:35.546
but they're at least
an hour away.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.515
CABE:
Everybody down!

18:49.562 --> 18:50.728
Stop the car.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.863
Stop the car?

18:51.865 --> 18:53.331
Stop the car?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.666
I strongly advise against
stopping the car!

18:55.668 --> 18:57.435
I can't get a steady shot
with all this movement.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.703
We got one shot.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.638
I got to make it count,
stop the car.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.807
Stop the car!

19:02.809 --> 19:04.876
(tires screeching)

19:26.566 --> 19:28.833
John Wayne.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.735
Okay, let's go!

19:30.737 --> 19:32.670
Those thugs are gonna
be right behind us.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.704
(engine starter whirring)

19:33.706 --> 19:35.306
Uh, some of the bullets

19:35.308 --> 19:36.474
must've hit the engine.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.708
Big problem.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.611
Not nearly as big as this one.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.557
(grunts)

19:52.559 --> 19:54.192
WALTER:
Cabe!

19:54.194 --> 19:55.226
Give me your jacket.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.295
Come on, let's go, let's go!

19:58.298 --> 20:00.565
TOBY:
Okay, you need to keep

20:00.567 --> 20:01.666
that pressure consistent
and firm.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.367
I'm fine!
No, you're not.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.304
As hard as this may sound, you
need to take easy breaths, relax

20:06.306 --> 20:07.672
and slow your heart.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.407
You'll lose less blood
until we can get you some help.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.608
Which won't be for a while.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.909
Medevac's scrambled from Yuma

20:11.911 --> 20:13.711
but it'll be 45 minutes
till they get to you.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.580
And we can't take him
to the hospital.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.348
The bullets
ripped through the pan.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.483
There's no more oil.
The engine seized up.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.420
These drug runners will be
on us before we know it.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.688
We're sitting ducks out here.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.423
Then we don't stay here.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.359
I've surveyed this area with
U.S. Border Patrol for years.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.395
There's a coyote shack
a mile north of the rise.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.763
Coyote shack?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.332
Human trafficking
way station.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.667
Food, water and a chance
to get some rest.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.769
Sly, Happy,
you take Sanchez there.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.439
Here, put pressure,
put pressure on it.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.575
And then, Paige
will let medevac know

20:44.577 --> 20:46.310
where they're heading.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.478
What about you and Cabe?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.313
We'll make some time

20:49.315 --> 20:50.414
with these.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.449
Road flares?

20:51.451 --> 20:52.600
And some siphoned gas.

20:52.601 --> 20:53.750
I think I know
what you're doing.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.019
You're gonna need my phone.
Okay.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.520
(groans)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:56.522 --> 20:58.389
Sanchez is not looking good!
Toby?

20:58.391 --> 20:59.657
Gravity's not a friend
to blood loss.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.926
You got to get him to that shack
and on his back.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.394
HAPPY:
Good luck!

21:03.395 --> 21:04.861
All right, Cabe,
lift the hood?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.397
Then pull any wires
that you can find.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.832
We need to make a booby trap.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.537
(talking quietly)

21:16.342 --> 21:17.642
Doc, you there?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.477
Right by your side.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.845
Sanchez isn't
looking so good.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.581
Oh, I think he's passed out!

21:25.852 --> 21:27.318
His pulse is very weak.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.519
Check the wound.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.526
Uh, there's more
blood than before.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.512
And his jacket's soaked.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.497
Ah, the bullet probably shifted
during the walk.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.865
Might've nicked his liver.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.400
Okay, he's got
maybe 60 seconds left

21:42.402 --> 21:44.335
if you don't find something
to stuff in that wound.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.404
Something more absorbent
than Cabe's jacket.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.306
Okay, Doc, I don't think I've
ever said this to you before,

21:48.308 --> 21:50.641
but I'm not really
crazy about blood.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.743
He's going to die
if you don't do something.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.078
It's not like there's
medical sponges in here.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.079
It's a shack.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.814
That's it-- sponges.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.849
Here, quickly, give me
your pocketknife.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sly,

22:00.086 --> 22:01.585
do not cut that man
with a pocketknife!

22:01.587 --> 22:02.787
I am not.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.356
I'm cutting into a cactus.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.724
Which has evolved

22:06.726 --> 22:08.926
to contain spongy,
succulent tissue

22:08.928 --> 22:10.995
that stores water.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.598
There.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.500
Looks absorbent to me.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.470
Here.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.038
Why are you
giving it to me?

22:21.039 --> 22:22.605
So you can, you know,
shove it in.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.008
It's your cactus, you do it.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.543
Have you just met me?

22:25.545 --> 22:26.911
This is Happy's time to shine.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.713
Get that sponge in there now!

22:35.488 --> 22:36.954
TOBY:
Okay, if this works,

22:36.956 --> 22:40.691
the bleeding should slow
immediately and BP will rise.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.128
Guys, how are we
looking there?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.364
Come on, guys,
I need an update!

22:46.366 --> 22:49.033
Happy!
Happy, do you copy?!

22:49.035 --> 22:50.868
She's outside throwing up.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.871
I think I might join
her in a minute, but

22:53.873 --> 22:55.773
Sanchez is stabilized.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.541
He's semi-conscious now.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.677
You know, now that
I think about it.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.746
You know what this desert
mission could've used?

23:01.748 --> 23:02.880
A doctor.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.682
Walter could've
never predicted...

23:04.684 --> 23:06.584
All he does is predict.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.519
He predicted that I wouldn't
be needed on this case.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.654
And he's predicting
all these imaginary problems

23:10.656 --> 23:12.857
that'll come to Scorpion from me
and Happy being together.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.960
Like you possibly reacting
too emotionally to things?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.995
What a shock
that Miss Human Feelings

23:17.997 --> 23:21.565
would finally agree with robot
Walter on this one issue.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.584
What is that supposed to mean?

23:23.585 --> 23:25.602
You both know that if you
change the fraternization rule,

23:25.605 --> 23:27.571
then you two lose
the only obstacle you have,

23:27.573 --> 23:30.775
the only excuse you have
for not being together!

23:30.777 --> 23:34.445
Happy and me,
we let our freak flag fly!

23:35.681 --> 23:38.682
Your comms are still on, dummy.

23:38.684 --> 23:41.552
In my anger, I forgot,
but I stand by my analysis!

23:41.554 --> 23:43.521
You copy that, Walter?!

23:43.523 --> 23:44.955
Will you please shut up?

23:44.957 --> 23:46.090
They're here.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.697
They could be in there!
Get ready!

23:57.970 --> 23:59.970
(phone ringing)

23:59.972 --> 24:01.105
Did you hear that?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.784
(both shout)

24:26.866 --> 24:28.499
He's still alive.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.900
Yeah, mine, too.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.703
He's gonna wish he wasn't
when he wakes up.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.638
Happy? Sly?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.006
We're gonna take their truck.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.641
and we're gonna come
and get you and Sanchez.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.076
Oh, scratch that.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.578
We got company.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.612
Let's go!
Move it!

24:41.614 --> 24:42.663
PAIGE:
Who's after you?

24:42.664 --> 24:43.713
You just knocked out
the bad guys.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.683
Looks like we weren't
the only ones

24:45.685 --> 24:47.518
who called for backup!

24:47.520 --> 24:49.854
They're gaining on us fast.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.122
HAPPY: Okay, the weight of the
trailer is killing your RPMs.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.824
They'll be on you
before you know it.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.759
Tell Gallo...

24:57.563 --> 25:00.798
...there's a switchback
at the end of the canyon.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.534
He can lose them there.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.035
HAPPY: Sanchez says
there's a switchback.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.505
It's kind of a big desert.
I need details.

25:07.507 --> 25:08.606
They're on our tail.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.140
I can talk him through it.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.243
I just need to catch my br...
(gasping)

25:12.245 --> 25:14.278
(gasping)

25:14.280 --> 25:16.080
Toby?

25:16.082 --> 25:17.781
Sanchez can't breathe

25:17.783 --> 25:19.283
and his lips are turning blue.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.851
They caught up to us!

25:20.853 --> 25:23.220
Guys, we need to know
which way to turn off!

25:23.222 --> 25:24.154
Okay, you're gonna
have to wing it!

25:24.156 --> 25:25.956
Doc, this man is dying

25:25.958 --> 25:28.025
in front of us-- you're gonna
have to tell us what to do!

25:36.035 --> 25:38.302
PAIGE:
Walter, where are you guys?

25:38.304 --> 25:39.637
Jumped off the main road
in the canyon somewhere.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.871
There are no
mile markers here.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.007
(gunfire continues)

25:46.646 --> 25:47.845
Oh, man.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.715
Okay, Happy, good news is
the medevac chopper's

25:51.717 --> 25:53.951
only ten minutes away,
but the bad news is Sanchez

25:53.953 --> 25:56.320
has about three minutes
before he suffocates

25:56.322 --> 25:59.056
so you're gonna have
to perform some field surgery.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.691
Yeah, I can't do that!

26:00.693 --> 26:01.892
Yes, you can.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.294
I'm gonna talk you
through it, pal, okay?

26:03.296 --> 26:05.062
From your description
of the symptoms,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.864
I'm guessing
that abdominal blood

26:06.866 --> 26:08.566
has filled his plural space,
compressing a lung.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.151
That sounds bad!

26:10.152 --> 26:11.735
We can make it better.
We just have to drain the fluid.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.804
Is-is there a hose there
or a straw

26:13.806 --> 26:15.039
or a small pipe?
Uh...

26:15.041 --> 26:16.307
Rubber tubing!

26:16.309 --> 26:17.908
That's exactly
what we need, okay.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.043
How about a nail?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.644
A nail.

26:20.646 --> 26:21.679
Got one.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.080
Perfect!

26:23.082 --> 26:24.582
Anything to sterilize it?

26:24.584 --> 26:25.316
Tequila.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.750
That'll do.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.253
Dunk the nail and one end
of the tube in it.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.622
I think, uh, I think I already
know the answer to this,

26:31.624 --> 26:34.024
but why exactly are we
sterilizing this stuff?

26:34.026 --> 26:36.293
Because you are gonna insert

26:36.295 --> 26:38.729
that tube into Sanchez's
chest cavity.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.231
(gasping)

26:41.233 --> 26:43.367
Oh, that's what I was afraid of.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.306
Okay, okay.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.275
(gunfire)

26:56.082 --> 26:57.247
We got no way to shake them!

26:57.249 --> 26:58.282
I have an idea.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.034
You sure?

27:00.035 --> 27:01.785
Shooting at people
isn't really your thing.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.387
Yeah, I'm not gonna
shoot at people.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.322
All right.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.296
(tires screech)
(gunfire)

27:12.298 --> 27:13.964
(grunts)

27:13.966 --> 27:14.932
It worked!

27:14.934 --> 27:17.134
Yeah, good thing it did,

27:17.136 --> 27:20.371
'cause, uh, 'cause I kind of
dropped the gun, so...

27:21.941 --> 27:24.008
(gasping)

27:25.811 --> 27:26.877
Hole in cap-- done.

27:26.879 --> 27:27.945
Now what?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.146
Sly, thread the tube
through the hole

27:29.148 --> 27:30.748
and tape it up--
it has to be airtight.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.650
You're making a suction device.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.986
Okay.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.287
Done.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.156
Now, get Sanchez
into a seated position.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.859
Happy, push the nail
into the back.

27:41.861 --> 27:42.960
Uh, the back of what?

27:42.962 --> 27:44.662
The back of Sanchez!
Sanchez's back!

27:44.664 --> 27:46.096
Are you crazy?!

27:46.098 --> 27:48.399
Hey, for a million reasons

27:48.401 --> 27:50.067
the answer
to that question is yes.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.102
But believing in you,
the most incredible person

27:52.104 --> 27:55.205
that I've ever known--
no, that does not make me crazy.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.341
You hear my voice now?

27:57.343 --> 27:59.910
Hear how calm it is?

27:59.912 --> 28:02.046
Your anxiety's
lowering as we speak.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.415
You are a world-class engineer.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.684
Any gadget, gizmo,
machination or machine,

28:06.686 --> 28:09.386
you can master it,
and the body's just a machine.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.723
The heart is a water pump,
the lungs are the intake system.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.224
You're gonna use the nail
to bleed the brakes.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.993
Something you've
done a million times.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.995
Bleed the brakes.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.363
I just need to
bleed the brakes.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.832
Okay, first, find the middle
of the collarbone,

28:21.834 --> 28:24.935
and tap down from the top
until you hear a dull thud.

28:24.937 --> 28:28.338
That means the cavity's
full of blood.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.442
Then count down two ribs
and gently push the nail

28:31.444 --> 28:33.277
in over the top
of the rib below that.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.478
I found it.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.447
Now just gently insert it.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.726
Okay, it's in!

28:48.728 --> 28:49.993
Great job.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.729
You're almost done.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.964
Just take the sterilized end
of the tube,

28:53.966 --> 28:55.933
and slide that in
next to the nail.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.740
Ah, nothing much is coming out!

29:02.742 --> 29:04.441
It will.
Sly, give the water bottle

29:04.443 --> 29:07.778
a splash of lantern fluid,
light it and quickly cap it up.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.794
Done!

29:23.796 --> 29:26.063
Okay, the fire burned off
any oxygen in the bottle.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.898
Creating a vacuum
to suck out the fluid.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.036
It's working!

29:33.038 --> 29:36.240
(Sanchez inhales deeply)

29:36.242 --> 29:38.142
(coughing)

29:39.111 --> 29:41.245
Oh, Doc,
thank you for the assist.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.513
You're welcome.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.847
Good work, Doc.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.550
I'm proud of you.

29:46.552 --> 29:50.287
WALTER: Guys, we could use
some help, too!

29:50.289 --> 29:52.856
We're about eight miles
north-northwest of the shack.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.491
We left the road,
we're in the canyon.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.494
Not the direction
I wanted you to go.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.863
Well, we improvised.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.969
Oh, yeah, that's a problem.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.371
They're back on our tail.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.040
It's a bigger problem
than you think.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.575
Why?
(grunts)

30:11.577 --> 30:13.510
(tires screech)

30:14.480 --> 30:16.313
That's why.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.382
SANCHEZ:
<i> It's a box canyon.</i>

30:18.384 --> 30:20.517
There's no way out.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.186
You're trapped.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.829
You got any ideas?
Lots.

30:31.831 --> 30:37.100
Just none of them pertaining
to our current situation.

30:37.102 --> 30:38.969
(vehicle approaching)

30:41.540 --> 30:44.341
We got to get them out of there.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.109
Happy, didn't you give
Walter your phone?

30:46.111 --> 30:48.011
Yeah, but how
does that help?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.479
I'll explain later.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.615
Sly, you got your
laptop on you?

30:51.617 --> 30:53.250
Of course, but why?

30:55.554 --> 30:57.554
Put your hands up!

30:57.556 --> 30:59.089
Get out slowly.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.490
Cabe.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.560
Do what they say, son.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.531
Move over!

31:07.533 --> 31:09.600
Get away
from the truck!

31:15.875 --> 31:18.108
We know you're
not alone.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.645
Tell us where your friends are.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.313
We're hard to get along with.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.648
We don't have any friends.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.485
You think I'm just gonna
shoot here and that's it?

31:28.487 --> 31:30.454
We're in the desert, my man.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.623
There's no law over here.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.458
So I'm gonna
get this guy...

31:34.460 --> 31:37.127
you will eventually tell me
whatever I want to know

31:37.129 --> 31:38.996
just to get his screams
out of your ears.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.597
You must be sampling
your own product

31:40.599 --> 31:42.266
if you think that we're
gonna tell you anything.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.668
(grunting)

31:46.472 --> 31:47.638
Oh, my God, hurry!

31:47.640 --> 31:49.673
I'm going as fast as I can!

31:49.675 --> 31:51.442
Shoot him in the leg.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.210
If we don't get what we
want, blast his hand off.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.312
I'm his boss.
He's nothing in this.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.081
(drone whirring)

31:58.083 --> 32:00.017
Uh, you're in trouble now.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.327
What's that toy
gonna do to us, man?

32:10.329 --> 32:12.329
Oh, not him.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.664
Him.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.531
(gunfire)

32:21.573 --> 32:24.174
The drones follow a leader.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.543
And Birdroni is
their leader now.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.644
Shoot it down!

32:27.646 --> 32:29.479
(gunfire)

32:32.217 --> 32:33.550
Two guns on one.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.252
I can still take you down.

32:35.254 --> 32:38.722
You can, but my friends
are gonna open fire

32:38.724 --> 32:42.559
from 20 feet in the air,
and you're gonna be dead, too.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.195
This is the part
where you put your weapon down

32:45.197 --> 32:46.730
and get on the ground.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.607
All right.
Good job, we're okay.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.142
(helicopter blades whirring)
So are we.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.510
Medevac's here.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.613
SYLVESTER: Sanchez is
on his way to the hospital.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.682
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:15.127 --> 33:17.594
I can't believe Walter bought us
a cotton candy machine.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.129
WALTER:
Yeah, I can't believe it either.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.164
But it just got
delivered here?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.633
I didn't know what was in
the box, I just signed for it.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.036
Someone must have stolen
your credit card number.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.307
You were mad at Walter

33:30.309 --> 33:31.775
so you charged a bunch
of expensive nonsense

33:31.777 --> 33:33.643
to the corporate card
just to annoy him?

33:33.645 --> 33:36.046
Your Super Fun Guy pinball
machine arrives tomorrow.

33:36.048 --> 33:39.049
Sweet, but I'm more worried
if you'll be here tomorrow.

33:39.051 --> 33:41.051
Walter's ultimatum
may be moot.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.652
Happy's pissed at me.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.654
Well, putting tracking
software in her cell phone

33:44.656 --> 33:46.790
is pretty stalkerish.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.192
Just eat your cotton candy
and shut up.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.263
Nothing says "I'm sorry"
like a web of spun sugar.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.138
You know,
in my defense,

34:01.139 --> 34:02.706
if I hadn't installed
that app on your phone,

34:02.708 --> 34:04.708
then Sly wouldn't have
tracked Walt and Cabe

34:04.710 --> 34:07.277
and sent reprogrammed
Birdroni to the rescue.

34:07.279 --> 34:11.381
You're hugging the bunny
way too tight, Lennie.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.752
You're right.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.687
I'm sorry.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.591
I'm scared.

34:21.593 --> 34:23.260
You don't know what I
felt in the South Pole.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.262
You-you were literally lost
in the middle of a whiteout

34:25.264 --> 34:27.197
with no idea where you were.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.200
I was without you,

34:30.202 --> 34:31.668
and-and you don't get it,
'cause this is new to you,

34:31.670 --> 34:34.504
but, uh, I've been
in love with you for years.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.442
If I'm hugging bunny tight,

34:38.444 --> 34:40.343
it's 'cause I don't want
to lose bunny again.

34:40.345 --> 34:43.613
Stop referring to me as "bunny."

34:43.615 --> 34:45.849
Okay, but you started that.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.851
I like you. A lot.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.220
You're not gonna lose me
literally or figuratively.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.689
Unless you put tracking software
on my cell phone again.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.791
I won't have to break up with
you, because you'll be dead.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.661
Copy that.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.410
Just got off the phone.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.745
Sanchez is gonna be okay.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.414
And those drug runners
we busted,

35:17.416 --> 35:18.748
they flipped on their bosses.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.451
It's gonna shut down
their heroin trade for a while.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.886
Eh, bad guys always adapt.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.155
They'll find another way
to smuggle the stuff in.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.389
This war isn't over.

35:26.391 --> 35:27.724
We did win a battle.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.493
A lot of the drugs
won't be hitting the streets.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.128
Given the size of
the shipment we stopped

35:31.130 --> 35:33.463
and near-future shipments
of the same size,

35:33.465 --> 35:36.233
taking into account
overdose statistics,

35:36.235 --> 35:37.834
the gang war
over distribution,

35:37.836 --> 35:39.169
and adjusting
for a margin of error,

35:39.171 --> 35:42.506
we saved 4,287 lives, minimum.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.741
Now that's not
a bad day's work, huh?

35:45.777 --> 35:47.644
All right, I'm gonna
head up to the loft

35:47.646 --> 35:49.779
to work on that drone
that we caught.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.314
Whatever I learn,

35:51.316 --> 35:54.317
I'll incorporate into
the DEA's border defenses.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.886
Sounds good.

35:59.925 --> 36:03.527
So, uh, I assume that
your relationship is resolved?

36:05.430 --> 36:08.732
'Cause the intensity of today's
case demonstrates the need

36:08.734 --> 36:12.202
for constant...
laser-like focus.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.204
No distractions.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.273
Okay, great.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.716
What's on your mind?

36:26.718 --> 36:29.386
You heard over the comms
how great Happy and Toby were

36:29.388 --> 36:31.855
when they were saving
Sanchez's life.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.857
They probably worked
better together

36:33.859 --> 36:36.626
now that they are together
than they ever have.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.827
I thought that
we agreed on this.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.696
We can't risk the team.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.765
I know, but maybe we should
think of Scorpion

36:41.767 --> 36:45.769
as less of a team and more of a
living organism that can evolve.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.437
Like the cactus
they used today,

36:47.439 --> 36:49.439
it adapted to living
in the desert,

36:49.441 --> 36:51.341
it became a better
version of itself.

36:51.343 --> 36:55.345
Didn't Darwin say that to thrive
you have to change?

36:55.347 --> 36:57.814
Actually, it was a professor
named Leon Megginson.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.683
He said,
"It is not the strongest

36:59.685 --> 37:02.352
"of the species that survives,
nor the most intelligent.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.788
it is the one that is
the most adaptable to change."

37:04.790 --> 37:08.892
But Scorpion does not
need to change.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.493
HAPPY:
That's right.

37:10.495 --> 37:13.863
Uh, and that's why we're
not going anywhere.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.865
You asked us to
make a decision.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.301
Well, we decided
you suck.

37:18.303 --> 37:19.970
And for a genius,

37:19.972 --> 37:21.972
sometimes you can
really be an idiot.

37:21.974 --> 37:23.891
Scorpion is your team.

37:23.892 --> 37:25.809
You can make your own mistake,
but we're not making it for you.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.310
We won't quit.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.312
You're gonna have
to fire both of us.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.981
Yeah, we're
a package deal now.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.349
(whispering):
You're doing it again.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.321
Fine, you can both stay.

37:38.323 --> 37:40.924
I'm docking
your pay.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.592
For the cotton candy machine.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.495
You might think I'm an idiot,
but I'm not a moron.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.598
Fair enough.

37:52.337 --> 37:53.670
I'm proud of you.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.339
You are allowing Scorpion
to evolve.

37:56.341 --> 38:00.310
And who knows
where it will go next?

38:00.312 --> 38:01.978
Well, I hope it works out

38:01.980 --> 38:04.981
because, uh, adaptation
is messy business.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.317
For every success story,
like the cactus,

38:07.319 --> 38:08.985
there is an evolutionary
dead end

38:08.987 --> 38:10.687
that leads to extinction, so...

38:15.527 --> 38:19.963
But for now, I-I guess it is
worth keeping an open mind.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.969
You really told him.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.304
That was awesome.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.938
I had to defend
your honor.

38:28.940 --> 38:29.939
That's emasculating.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.341
(door opens)
MAN: Hey.

38:31.343 --> 38:34.044
I got a pair of Jet Skis
for O'Brien.

38:35.047 --> 38:36.913
Let's get out of here
before you get fired.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.682
Yep.
