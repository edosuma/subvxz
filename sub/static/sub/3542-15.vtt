00:02.719 --> 00:04.449
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.600 --> 00:06.284
Three sleeping Originals, four coffins.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.090
Who is in the lockbox?

00:10.160 --> 00:12.162
Coffin's open.
- Mother.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.250
It's an invitation.
"I think it's time we finally meet."

00:15.440 --> 00:18.011
Damon won't let me
near her without protection.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.844
What do you need me to do?

00:21.080 --> 00:23.242
- Hurry up.
- We upset the balance of nature...

00:23.400 --> 00:25.562
by turning my children
into vampires.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.569
It's my duty to kill them.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.929
- So it's true? She's forgiven Klaus?
- It's true.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.924
If I hadn't asked Stefan,
you'd have ruined everything.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.926
- I'm sorry for trying to keep you alive.
- You're mad at me for including Stefan?

00:38.160 --> 00:40.606
- I'm mad because I love you.
- That's the problem.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.842
- Where's Damon?
- Being self-destructive.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.411
I said something I didn't mean.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.762
Did you really not feel anything?

00:46.920 --> 00:49.446
If I let myself care, all I feel is pain.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.967
<i>Stefan, hey, um, it's me.</i>

01:52.480 --> 01:56.166
I really have to talk to you.
Please call me back.

02:17.360 --> 02:22.366
- What?
- Hey, I called you 10 times last night.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.081
We need to talk.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.648
Sorry, I've been busy.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.650
If you're mad at me, Damon,
you need to get over it.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.368
Oh, I'm over it.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.761
So let's not make
a big deal out of this.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.206
My thoughts exactly.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.688
Besides, I expect
you'll come calling soon enough.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.363
Let's not hold our breath.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.767
Did you stop taking your vervain?

03:23.360 --> 03:26.284
- You think Rebekah had to compel me?
- What's wrong with you?

03:26.480 --> 03:29.165
She tried to kill me
less than 48 hours ago.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.927
Can't we just move past that, Elena?

03:33.440 --> 03:35.283
So is that how it's gonna be now?

03:35.520 --> 03:38.922
I hurt your feelings
and this is how you lash out at me?

03:39.080 --> 03:43.290
Well, maybe for once, something
I did had nothing to do with you.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.763
You should know...

03:48.840 --> 03:51.969
that Esther's planning
on killing her entire family.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.091
She's linked them together with a spell.
Whatever happens to one happens to all.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.326
That's great. Klaus will finally be dead.
We win.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.602
Why do you look like
someone just shot a panda bear?

04:04.840 --> 04:07.889
Because to kill Klaus,
she has to kill all of them...

04:08.080 --> 04:10.401
including Elijah,
and he doesn't deserve this.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.725
- I'm supposed to care about Elijah?
- Shouldn't you care about Rebekah?

04:14.920 --> 04:19.959
Two seconds ago, you were pissed
that she attacked you. It's a win-win.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.768
- Don't do anything to screw this up.
- Why are you doing this?

04:25.960 --> 04:28.645
He's right, you know.
Klaus has to die. They all do.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.770
See? It's democracy in action.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.003
Well, well, well. There's our girl.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.005
- Get out of my way, Kol.
- Out all night. What a scandal.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.006
I trust you did better than
that commoner. Matt, was it?

05:01.160 --> 05:05.484
If you don't shut your mouth, the next
thing to come out of it will be your teeth.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.764
- Don't start, Nik.
- I didn't say anything.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.931
I'm bored. Ah. Our sister is a strumpet.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.368
But at least she's having fun.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.649
- I need entertainment.
- What are you waiting for? Have at it.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.326
It's no fun to go alone. Join me, Nik.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.522
It's the least you could do
after sticking a dagger in my heart.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.851
Okay. Why not?

05:31.040 --> 05:34.726
I didn't have enough to drink last night
with you trying to murder her date.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.491
Go, this house has enough men
rolling around in it.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.284
Just like you, Bekah.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.445
Good riddance, both of you.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.565
Rebekah.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.441
Not you too, Elijah.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.846
I'm worried about Mother.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.720
Have you not noticed
her strange behavior?

05:52.920 --> 05:56.481
She's been dead for a thousand years.
What's strange for her?

05:56.640 --> 05:58.722
Burned sage.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.241
She was doing a privacy spell.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.403
You know she fancies such things.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.245
- Ask Finn, he's been doting on her.
- I don't trust Finn.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.689
- He hates what we are, he always has.
- That's not true.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.207
And as for Mother,
she'll return for one reason:

06:12.400 --> 06:14.209
To make her family whole.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.730
She loves us. What trouble
are you looking to find?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.047
He was gloating, like actual gloat.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.050
Like he was proud of himself
for sleeping with her.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.042
Is it working?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.402
It's not working.
I can hear every word...

06:31.600 --> 06:33.568
about Damon the vampire gigolo.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.404
I don't know. It's a tricky spell.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.722
When Esther did it,
she kept the sage burning.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.450
There was a lot more smoke.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.047
All right. Try it again.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.723
Speaking of Esther...

06:49.880 --> 06:53.043
you should know she came to see me
and Abby this morning.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.443
And all this time you let me vent
about Damon?

06:58.640 --> 07:01.484
- I don't want you to worry.
- Okay, well, what did she want?

07:01.640 --> 07:03.722
She wanted to introduce herself.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.729
Abby and I helped bring her back.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.327
She's channeling our entire
ancestral bloodline for power.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.808
- She thought she was being polite.
- Okay, well, is there a way...

07:13.000 --> 07:14.968
to stop her from channeling you?

07:15.160 --> 07:17.322
Even if there was,
why would I want that?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.244
I just keep thinking...

07:20.120 --> 07:24.569
before the sun and the moon ritual,
Elijah found a way to keep me alive.

07:24.720 --> 07:30.011
And now I'm in the exact same position
and I'm just gonna let him die?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.685
It just doesn't feel right.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.601
Okay, first of all,
this privacy spell is totally not working.

07:37.760 --> 07:42.084
Second, Elena, you are not doing this.
Esther is doing this.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.447
There's no time to change your mind.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.564
- He'll be dead by the end of the night.
- What?

07:49.080 --> 07:50.525
It's a full moon.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.002
Esther needs to harness the energy
of a celestial event.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.362
She asked me and Abby to join her.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.530
Join me for a little victory drink?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.888
We should wait until Klaus is dead.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.527
Why are you so extra-broody? Didn't
you see the way we stood up to Elena?

08:10.680 --> 08:13.524
I like you on my team.
Must have driven her nuts.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.963
You still think
she's gonna screw this up, don't you?

08:17.160 --> 08:20.528
Somebody needs to talk to her.
She's not gonna listen to anything I say.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.604
- Is it because of your sleepover?
- Not my fault she got jealous.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.209
Well, given who you chose to sleep with,
I would say it's 100 percent your fault.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.725
Whatever. I did you a favor. Now you can
come in and sweep her off her feet.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.965
Nah, she's better off without me.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.686
Sure as hell better off without you.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.729
Fine. Neither one of us gets her.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.689
Just make sure
she doesn't screw up Esther's plan.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.168
- Elena.
- Elijah.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.442
I don't mean to intrude.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.648
I was hoping
you might accompany me.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.842
I wanna show you something.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.924
- Forgot how much I missed this land.
- Can't even imagine...

09:28.080 --> 09:30.447
what it must have been like
1000 years ago.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.564
You know your school
was built over an Indian village?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.722
Where I saw my first werewolf.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.447
The town square was where
the natives would gather to worship.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.610
Matter of fact,
near that there was a field...

09:43.360 --> 09:45.966
where wild horses used to graze.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.603
- That's incredible.
- Hmm.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.565
Come.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.489
- Do you know this place too?
- I do.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.126
Below us is a cavern
I used to play in as a boy.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.723
Connects to a system of tunnels
that stretch across the entire area.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.642
Nature's way of providing us
with shelter...

10:10.800 --> 10:13.406
against the savagery
of the full moon.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.803
My mother said
there must be a balance.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.645
Elijah, I should probably go home.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.247
I admire you, Elena.
You remind me of qualities I valued...

10:26.440 --> 10:28.966
long before my mother turned us.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.127
It's not in your nature
to be deceitful and yet...

10:32.360 --> 10:34.931
when I asked about
your meeting with my mother...

10:35.080 --> 10:37.367
you lied to my face.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.763
It's not true. I told you that
all your mother wanted was a new start.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.002
I can hear your heartbeat.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.286
It jumps when you're dishonest.
You lied at the ball, you are lying now.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.841
Tell me the truth.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.368
- I never wanted this to happen.
- What, Elena?

11:00.840 --> 11:04.526
We were told that whatever was gonna
be in that coffin was gonna kill Klaus.

11:04.760 --> 11:09.527
When we found out that it was your
mother, we didn't know what to think.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.644
Since her return, she said
she wants this family whole again.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.531
When she asked to see me...

11:15.680 --> 11:18.889
I thought that maybe she could help.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.884
That she would find a way
to kill Klaus.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.325
It's not just Klaus
that she wants to kill.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.369
She wants to kill us all, doesn't she?

11:33.560 --> 11:36.245
She wants to undo the evil
she created.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.164
I'm so sorry, Elijah.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.761
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.601
You know, one thing I've learned
in my time on this earth...

11:48.840 --> 11:51.047
be careful what you wish for.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.329
<i>I haven't seen Elena since this morning.</i>

12:12.480 --> 12:13.720
She's not answering her phone.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.930
Well, I'm surprised you have time to call
with all this Original sex you have.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.287
- She told you?
- Oh, she told me.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.569
Really? Did she tell you
she's having an attack of conscience...

12:23.760 --> 12:27.242
<i>- ...about this Original murder thing?
- I'm not gonna judge her for that.</i>

12:27.400 --> 12:30.688
You don't have to judge her.
Lock her in a room till this is over.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.969
Well, I wouldn't if I could
and I can't because I'm busy.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.482
- Busy doing what?
- Don't worry about it.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.128
Are you with the sexy psycho doctor?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.805
Goodbye, Damon.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.042
Sorry about that.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.441
Does he still think I'm a serial killer?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.284
He's a little judgmental.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.847
Speaking of...

13:02.320 --> 13:04.084
Your x-rays were inconclusive.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.442
Your knife wound
was already semi-healed.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.365
It's impossible to tell anything
about who stabbed you.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.968
Short, tall, left-handed,
right-handed, no clue.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.646
What about my head?
Why can't I remember the attack?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.290
Your CT scans were clear.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.370
Maybe you were compelled to forget.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.809
Wait. You think the killer is a...?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.365
A vampire.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.569
There are no other suspects.
It's the obvious conclusion.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.566
Oh, come on, now. Let's not go blaming
the new family in town...

13:32.720 --> 13:36.167
just because you lot
have got yourselves a killer at large.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.481
Don't mind us.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.127
My brother and I are just here
to let off some steam. Right, Kol?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.004
Right.

13:48.040 --> 13:51.328
- Who's the creepy lurky guy?
- That's Esther's son, Finn.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.767
<i>And he's a vampire, so...</i>

13:54.720 --> 13:58.088
I wonder what your grams thinks
about the part we're playing...

13:58.240 --> 14:01.528
- ...in this balance of nature stuff.
- Probably on the other side...

14:01.680 --> 14:04.524
screaming about getting involved
with vampire business.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.250
Yeah.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.844
Bennett witches,
thank you for coming.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.681
I can think of no better allies than
the woman who sent Mikael to sleep...

14:13.840 --> 14:16.650
and the girl who fought Niklaus
so bravely.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.726
Why exactly did you invite us here?

14:19.960 --> 14:23.362
You are the descendants of the witch
Ayana. She was a mentor of mine...

14:23.520 --> 14:26.046
and it's fitting that I draw
from her bloodline.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.720
So are you channeling our ancestors?

14:28.880 --> 14:33.090
I draw from the entirety of the
Bennett bloodline, living and dead.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.365
The connection affords me great power,
although it is difficult to maintain.

14:37.600 --> 14:42.561
Which is why I require you,
mother and daughter...

14:42.720 --> 14:44.563
the bloodline made manifest.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.401
Tonight, my sisters...

14:48.600 --> 14:51.444
we shall bring peace to the spirits
of nature we serve.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.763
And for that, I thank you.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.969
Going somewhere?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.851
- What are you doing here?
- Not much.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.331
Unless you try to run...

15:17.760 --> 15:20.286
in which case I get to kill you.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.969
I can't find her anywhere.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.610
Hello, Stefan.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.084
- He has Elena.
- Actually, she's with Rebekah.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.527
As you can imagine, my sister is
just dying to tear her throat out.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.442
So if you want to save Elena's life,
I need you to help me stop my mother.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.450
I'm embarrassed to admit,
but when it comes to killing...

15:41.600 --> 15:45.605
1000-year-old resurrected witches,
I'm a little rusty.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.049
Yes, unfortunately, even when killed,
my mother doesn't want to stay dead.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.288
Not with the spirits of nature
at her side.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.808
- So, what are we supposed to do?
- The witches that released my mother.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.646
She's drawing her power from their
bloodline. That line needs to be broken.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.122
Broken?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.408
Yeah, he means:

16:06.120 --> 16:09.124
- You want us to kill them.
- You know I'd do it myself...

16:09.320 --> 16:11.846
but I have absolutely no idea
where they are.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.486
Seeing me,
they'd immediately know my intent.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.480
They won't expect to be harmed
by the likes of you. In any case...

16:18.640 --> 16:21.166
you have until six minutes
after 9 to find them.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.522
Oh, how super-specific of you.

16:23.760 --> 16:27.321
By 9:07 the moon will be full and my
mother will have the power she needs.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.370
If you do not stop her before then...

16:31.000 --> 16:33.162
Rebekah will kill Elena.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.288
So we all have our timeline.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.325
I suggest you get started.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.441
All right, love,
now look into the camera.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.840
What are you doing?

16:47.040 --> 16:49.407
Shooting a picture
to inspire your boyfriends.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.571
Tell them how delightful it is being
stuck in a hole with your biggest fan.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.889
I guess you think
I had this coming, huh?

16:57.040 --> 16:58.371
After what I did to you.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.123
You know, I don't know what
I want more, to find out we're saved...

17:02.280 --> 17:04.521
or to find out it's
all right to kill you.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.242
This isn't my fault.

17:07.920 --> 17:12.243
I wanted to get rid of Klaus.
At one point, so did you.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.880
I didn't know your mom
was planning on killing you.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.442
Do you think I wanna spend
what could be the last hours of my life...

17:18.640 --> 17:21.928
having chitchat with a girl
who literally stabbed me in the back?

17:22.079 --> 17:23.525
Of course not.

17:23.720 --> 17:27.770
But for some reason everybody wants to
bend over backwards to save your life.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.562
Which is incredibly annoying,
but makes you the perfect hostage.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.129
So why don't you sit down
and shut up...

17:37.320 --> 17:39.926
before I ruin everything
by ripping your head off.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.406
Clock's ticking.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.967
You gonna help me brainstorm a plan
or are you too busy fixing a snack?

18:06.120 --> 18:08.088
We need to call Bonnie.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.807
There's gotta be a way for her to stop
Esther from channeling that power.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.644
A, what if she's with Esther?

18:13.840 --> 18:17.322
B, what if she can't cut her off?
C, I don't know how any of this works.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.448
- D, neither do you.
- Got a better plan?

18:19.600 --> 18:24.208
Worst-case scenario, simple mechanics.
Can't draw power from a dead battery.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.008
- Kill them.
- If it comes to that.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.648
There's gotta be another way.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.970
Well, what if I told you
I had a less diabolical plan?

18:42.840 --> 18:45.491
- You wanna dagger Elijah.
- They're all linked.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.001
One goes down, they all go down.
The witches live.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.685
Elena's safe. Problem solved.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.526
- Don't know how that will affect Klaus.
- Klaus isn't our current problem.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.001
The dagger's lethal
to any vampire who uses it.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.642
Well, I just so happen to know
someone crazy enough to give it a shot.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.847
Yeah, no, they're still here.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.209
They've, uh, drank their way through
half the Grill's liquor supply.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.806
Good. It'll be easier if they're wasted.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.850
<i>- So, what's the plan?
- Divide and conquer.</i>

19:12.040 --> 19:14.884
First we'll need
a little blond distraction.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.041
I remember her from last night.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.851
She looks like a tasty little thing.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.044
Say another word
and I'll tear out your liver.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.170
- Caroline.
- Oh, it's you.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.849
Join us for a drink?

19:36.440 --> 19:39.171
Hmm, I'd rather die of thirst. But thanks.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.002
Isn't she stunning?

19:44.200 --> 19:47.568
She certainly looks good
walking away from you.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.200
I'll take that as a challenge.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.210
- Caroline.
- Are you serious?

19:58.360 --> 20:00.249
Take a hint.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.404
Don't be angry, love.
We had a little spat.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.928
- I'm over it already.
- Oh, well, I'm not.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.764
How can I acquit myself?

20:11.800 --> 20:15.486
You and your expensive jewelry
and your romantic drawings...

20:15.680 --> 20:17.284
can leave me alone.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.760
Oh, come on. Take a chance, Caroline.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.965
Talk to me.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.605
Come on, get to know me.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.609
I dare you.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.805
Fine.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.611
- So, what do you want to talk about?
- I wanna talk about you.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.770
Your hopes, your dreams.
Everything you want in life.

21:02.120 --> 21:06.330
Just to be clear,
I'm too smart to be seduced by you.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.171
Well, that's why I like you.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.049
The pentagram represents
our connection to magic.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.447
The salt is a symbol of the earth.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.365
- And the torches?
- Five torches.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.522
One for each of my children.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.010
What's the spell you're doing?

21:28.440 --> 21:31.683
As the witch who cast the spell
that made them vampires...

21:31.840 --> 21:34.161
I can also reverse it.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.688
When they become human again,
they can be killed.

21:38.120 --> 21:42.011
As they are linked as one,
my brave Finn will be the sacrifice.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.851
With his death will come theirs.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.005
And you're just willing to die?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.680
My mother's releasing me
from an eternity of shame.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.163
It's not a sacrifice, it's a gift.

22:04.880 --> 22:08.566
A woman of your caliber ought
to choose more suitable company.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.724
- What's your name, love?
- None of your business.

22:11.880 --> 22:16.568
- Let's try that again. I'll start. I'm Kol.
- Why don't you get lost, Kol?

22:16.720 --> 22:18.210
And why would I do that?

22:18.360 --> 22:20.931
I like pretty little things
with sharp tongues.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.040
Pretty sure she told you to get lost.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.407
Pretty sure I don't care.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.804
Next time, take a hint.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.922
Something's wrong.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.084
What is it?

22:58.200 --> 23:00.123
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.204
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything. Stop it.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.081
Kol.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.244
Here. Grab him.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.402
Tell the sexy doctor good work.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.249
I should have killed you months ago.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.768
Do it. It's not gonna stop Esther
from killing you.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.282
What did you say about my mother?

23:35.440 --> 23:37.841
You didn't know
I was friends with your mommy?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.970
We have a lot in common.
She hates you as much as I do.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.645
Leave him.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.971
We still need him, Niklaus.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.970
What did Mother do?

23:51.440 --> 23:52.965
What did she do, Elijah?

23:57.440 --> 24:02.002
You tell me where the witches are or
I'll have my sister kill Elena right now.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.450
You told me we had until after 9.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.161
I'm sure Rebekah would be more
than happy to start her work early.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.570
You can't hide, Elena.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.688
Not sure why
I'm feeling under the weather.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.844
Must be your boys trying
to find a loophole.

24:37.400 --> 24:42.201
Won't matter. I could chase you down
on my worst day.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.930
- Boo.
- Unh!

24:53.080 --> 24:55.287
You little bitch.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.041
What is this?

25:05.760 --> 25:07.762
Sorry

25:07.920 --> 25:10.241
No vampires allowed.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.450
- No, no, no.
- Ugh.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.122
Elena's still out there.
I need to find her.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.443
Shut up. Stay seated.
You might have a concussion.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.920
So this is your place, huh?
Kind of a slob.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.129
- Housekeeping is not high on my list.
- I see that.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.089
Look at me.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.368
Pupillary response is normal.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.804
You might have a broken rib.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.080
That kind of sucks.
Getting my ass kicked on a date.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.289
That's what you get, picking fights
with guys 30 times your age.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.130
Rest. Damon and Stefan
are gonna take care of Elena.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.807
I am going to take care of you.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.488
Do we know
they'll be at the witch house?

26:16.760 --> 26:18.000
We don't.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.482
If they're not, we have 10 minutes
until Rebekah tears Elena apart.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.490
If we sit this out,
Esther completes her spell, Klaus dies.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.684
You get your revenge.
It's what you wanted the whole time.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.640
- The only collateral damage is...
- Elena.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.368
You know what she'd choose.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.842
She'd let herself be killed
to save a friend.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.570
Yup.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.044
- If we do this, it'll wreck her.
- Oh, she'll hate us.

26:49.760 --> 26:54.641
Thing is, she only has to hate one of us.
Only one of us has to do the actual deed.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.091
Hmm.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.521
So who's it gonna be, brother?

27:04.600 --> 27:05.886
Well...

27:08.040 --> 27:11.169
Heads I do it, tails you do it.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.570
Awful lot of effort for someone who
pretends not to care about her anymore.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.610
Pot, kettle, brother.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.051
Elena?

27:55.880 --> 27:57.848
Let's pick it up where we left off.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.765
- What are you doing?
- Thought I'd shake things up a bit.

28:07.880 --> 28:08.927
Are you insane?

28:09.120 --> 28:11.122
I prefer "spontaneous."

28:11.280 --> 28:14.090
That's probably
why Damon likes me so much.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.410
Here's what's gonna happen.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.290
You're gonna come outside.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.122
Or you're gonna stay in there and burn.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.610
The next match is landing on you.

28:46.760 --> 28:50.890
So, Elena, how does it feel to know
that these may be your last moments?

28:52.400 --> 28:54.323
I don't know, you tell me.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.211
You're the one whose mother
is trying to kill you.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.200
You should be very careful
what you say to me.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.931
You're still wearing her necklace.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.487
Do you want it?
Is that your last request?

29:06.720 --> 29:09.451
Here, it's all yours.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.811
She's not doing this
because she hates you, Rebekah.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.123
She told me that
she just doesn't have another choice.

29:16.280 --> 29:20.763
Spare me your pity, Elena.
We're not girlfriends.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.366
You want me to prove it?
Just say the word.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.645
- You're not gonna do it.
- And why is that?

29:33.840 --> 29:37.367
Because there's still a chance
that you might be alive tomorrow.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.889
And if that's the case
and you kill me now...

29:42.040 --> 29:46.807
you'll have used up
all of your revenge. Wasted it.

29:46.960 --> 29:51.045
And isn't that what you want?
Revenge?

29:51.240 --> 29:56.326
Because I pretended to like you
and then I stuck a dagger in your back.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.683
I mean, that's why
you slept with Damon, isn't it?

29:59.840 --> 30:03.128
That's why you're tormenting me.
Because I hurt your feelings.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.042
The tough act doesn't suit you.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.487
I never said I was tough.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.408
But we both know I'm right.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.929
They're coming, Mother.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.801
No. It's too soon. The moon is not
high enough. Go, quickly.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.050
- My sons-Come forward
- Stay beside me.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.010
It's okay. They can't enter.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.451
That's lovely. We're stuck out here...

30:54.600 --> 30:57.206
while the favorite son
plays sacrificial lamb.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.203
How pathetic you are, Finn.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.365
Be quiet, Kol. Your brother knows virtue
you cannot even imagine.

31:03.520 --> 31:07.241
Whatever you think of us, killing
your own children would be an atrocity.

31:07.400 --> 31:12.566
My only regret is that I did not let
you die a thousand years ago.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.923
Enough. All this talk is boring me.

31:16.360 --> 31:20.365
End this now, Mother,
or I'll send you back to hell.

31:21.600 --> 31:25.207
For a thousand years
I've been forced to watch you.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.849
I felt the pain of every victim,
suffered while you shed blood.

31:32.560 --> 31:37.407
Even you, Elijah, with your claim
to nobility, you're no better.

31:38.080 --> 31:42.722
All of you,
you're a curse on this earth...

31:43.480 --> 31:46.370
stretched out over generations.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.288
If you've come to plead for your life...

31:51.760 --> 31:55.924
I'm sorry,
you have wasted your time.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.767
This place has some serious vibe in it.

32:00.920 --> 32:06.006
The witch spirits will protect us,
but we should get into the basement.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.764
Abby?

32:19.160 --> 32:21.288
Stefan, what's going on?

32:21.960 --> 32:25.487
They took Elena. They're gonna kill her
unless we stop Esther.

32:27.280 --> 32:32.002
Oh, God, Stefan, I can't stop her.
She's channeling us.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.280
Bonnie, if you can't stop her...

32:36.840 --> 32:38.968
I have to find another way.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.290
Don't.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.530
Stefan, no.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.570
What are you gonna do?
Even if you kill us...

32:51.720 --> 32:55.486
Esther is channeling every witch
in our ancestry, living and dead.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.962
Esther's drawing from the witches
and the only way to cut her off...

32:59.320 --> 33:01.800
is if one of you is no longer a witch.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.644
This will only hurt a second.

33:08.560 --> 33:13.327
No. Sisters, do not abandon me.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.005
Mother!

33:37.320 --> 33:39.004
You can come out now.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.522
Seems your boys
took care of the problem.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.604
How did they do that?

33:44.760 --> 33:48.128
Damon turned your witch friend's
mother into a vampire.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.601
- What?
- Quite clever, actually.

33:50.760 --> 33:56.164
They needed to sever the witch line and,
well, you can't be a witch and a vampire.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.004
In any case, you're free to go.

34:02.280 --> 34:06.126
Oh, and, uh, by the way, you were right.

34:06.280 --> 34:10.126
I do prefer taking my time,
watching you suffer.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.726
Much more satisfying.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.330
She doesn't wanna see you.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.362
Please just let me talk to her.

34:35.560 --> 34:39.929
Abby's in transition. It's gonna be
really hard over the next few days.

34:40.080 --> 34:44.802
And if Bonnie needs some time to deal,
then I think you should give it to her.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.964
She's always been there for me,
Caroline.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.206
Please let me just be there for her too.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.364
I'm sorry, Elena.

34:54.520 --> 34:59.242
I know that you wanna help,
but put yourself in her shoes.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.244
Everything that happened tonight
was to save you.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.885
And that's okay,
because she loves you so much.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.969
But somehow she's always the one
who gets hurt.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.727
You're right.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.530
<i>I just...</i>

35:22.880 --> 35:25.724
Just tell her that I love her, okay?

35:26.240 --> 35:28.083
Of course I will.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.403
Is she safe?

35:52.920 --> 35:57.050
Elijah kept his word.
Rebekah let her go.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.443
Good. All's right in the world again.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.325
I lost that coin toss, Damon.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.646
It should have been me
that turned Abby.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.722
- Why'd you do it?
- Because I'm not blind.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.763
I see what's been going on
around here.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.129
You're hanging by a thread.
Barely over your last Ripper-binge...

36:20.320 --> 36:24.370
and all you want is to be
the old Stefan again.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.483
That part of me is gone for good.

36:27.640 --> 36:31.281
Oh yeah? How long has it been
since you had a drop of human blood?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.000
How'd you know?

36:36.200 --> 36:40.410
You spend 146 years with someone, you
kind of start to pick up on their tells.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.201
Answer the question.
How long's it been since your last drink?

36:48.280 --> 36:51.568
Since the night I threatened
to drive Elena off of Wickery Bridge.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.561
See? You have enough
to feel guilty about.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.051
Why add to the list?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.489
By the way, you're welcome.

37:01.840 --> 37:06.528
You're not fooling anyone either.
You still love her, Damon.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.371
I do.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.283
I thought I could win her from you
fair and square.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.369
She didn't want me.

37:20.600 --> 37:24.889
It's for the best.
I'm better at being the bad guy, anyway.

37:47.680 --> 37:53.528
<i>- Elena. Today I did things I abhor...</i>

37:53.680 --> 37:55.364
<i>My family.</i>

37:55.520 --> 37:58.842
<i>If anyone can understand that, it's you.</i>

37:59.400 --> 38:02.085
<i>Your compassion is a gift, Elena.</i>

38:02.240 --> 38:07.804
<i>Carry it with you, as I will carry
my regret, always and forever.</i>

38:07.960 --> 38:09.041
<i>Elijah.</i>

38:21.960 --> 38:26.409
- Where the bloody hell is everyone?
- It's over, Rebekah.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.080
Where's Mother?

38:30.240 --> 38:36.771
We have no mother, only Esther.
And Esther was right.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.651
- What do you mean?
- All my talk of virtue...

38:39.800 --> 38:43.361
when it suits my needs,
I kill, maim, and torment.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.442
Even today, I terrorized an innocent.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.648
Elena is hardly innocent.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.889
And I used your hatred of her
to get what I wanted.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.764
Wielded you like I would a sword.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.364
My sister.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.331
You did it to protect us, Elijah,
and rightly so.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.602
We deserve to live.
We're better than they are.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.649
Are we?

39:08.600 --> 39:11.080
Mother made us vampires.

39:12.640 --> 39:16.645
She didn't make us monsters.
We did that to ourselves.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.644
I thought you'd have gone by now.
Elijah's leaving.

39:37.800 --> 39:43.125
Kol has fled.
Esther and Finn are gone too.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.329
I hated you
when I learned you killed our mother.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.764
I realize now that
after a thousand years as a family...

39:50.920 --> 39:52.968
you're the only one
who never left me.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.881
Well, aren't we a pair?

39:56.080 --> 39:57.844
There's something you need to see.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.441
Come to brag about your skills
as a torturer?

40:00.640 --> 40:03.325
Look at the images on the wall
behind Elena.

40:03.480 --> 40:07.405
The natives told the story of our history.
Look at the images on the far wall.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.085
What is it?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.720
A native worshipping
at the great white oak tree.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.368
And we burned that tree to the ground.

40:15.520 --> 40:20.082
Look at the markings that precede it.
That's the native calendar.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.003
This can't be right.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.926
A white oak tree 300 years
after we fled back to the Old World.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.883
There must have been a sapling,
a new tree to replace the old.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.685
That tree could kill us.
It's not over, Nik.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.444
You weren't supposed to see that.
