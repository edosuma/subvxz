00:55.520 --> 00:57.010
<i>Ah, Mother's Day.</i>

00:57.200 --> 00:59.726
Paige, come on, honey,
you have to go to school.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.450
<i>I love being a mother.</i>

01:01.760 --> 01:04.968
<i>But what about the other
364 days of the year?</i>

01:05.160 --> 01:07.367
<i>When you're trying to
get your kid to school</i>

01:07.520 --> 01:10.171
<i>and you're surviving
on very little sleep</i>

01:10.280 --> 01:13.966
<i>because you're up all night sewing
costumes for the school play</i>

01:14.040 --> 01:16.000
<i>and you've still got to go
to work in the morning.</i>

01:16.560 --> 01:17.561
Go.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.081
<i>It's about
the never-ending driving</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:22.447
<i>to soccer,
gymnastics, or ballet.</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:26.763
<i>It's about getting your kids
to look up from their computer</i>

01:26.840 --> 01:30.367
<i>or iPad or iPod or iPhone or
whatever "I" they're looking at.</i>

01:30.680 --> 01:33.968
Paige, wait, honey,
yourbanana, hold on, hold on!

01:35.160 --> 01:37.083
It's okay, honey,
just eat the peach.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.611
Eat the peach, it's fine.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.160
<i>In other words,
it's about being</i> a...

01:41.240 --> 01:43.402
Mom! Mom!

01:44.160 --> 01:45.400
Mom!

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Peter...

01:46.880 --> 01:49.724
Wait, wait, wait...
breathe, slow down, slow down,

01:49.800 --> 01:51.211
breathe, hold on.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.086
There you go. See?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.240
Now tell me what happened.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.442
Peter left the top
of the ant farm open.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.767
All the ants are gone,
even the big red one.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.485
Oh, why? Why did I buy
this for you guys?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.971
I swear, I don't...

02:12.040 --> 02:14.168
Hey, hey, hey, Peter,
where did that come from?

02:14.320 --> 02:16.721
You know no junk food
for breakfast anymore.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.690
Dad brought them.
He lets us.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.931
He also lets you go to
school without any underwear.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.163
It's called
free-balling, Mom.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.246
I swear.
Where are all of these ants?

02:27.320 --> 02:28.416
It happened in the backyard.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.522
God. Peter, I'm not kidding.
I'm counting to three.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.125
One, two...

02:32.200 --> 02:33.201
Three.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.845
What?
When did that stop working?

02:36.920 --> 02:38.843
Come on,
I brought a box of donuts.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.240
It's not a federal offense,

02:40.320 --> 02:42.971
but I will take credit
for the underwear.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.604
Good morning.
Hello.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.842
Did you look this good
when we were married?

02:50.920 --> 02:52.888
No, I actually got better.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.847
When did you get in here? I
didn't even hear you come in.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.649
Came in through the back door.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.041
I mean, we don't want the neighbors
talking, do we?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.690
Hmm. Are you hungry?

03:01.760 --> 03:02.761
Mmm.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.450
Here, have a donut.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.368
Your parents are divorced,
right?

03:07.440 --> 03:09.204
Oh, trust me, there's weirdness.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.851
So, Peter, you decided
to invite your friends over

03:11.960 --> 03:13.644
at 7:45 in the morning?

03:13.720 --> 03:14.721
Hi.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.684
We're meeting here
for the carpool today.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.564
- And the donuts.
- At my request.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.125
All right, you little hooligans,
let's go, time for school.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.247
Load up.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.364
Please, you cannot bring this
stuff into the house anymore.

03:28.200 --> 03:33.001
Yeah, but, uh, seriously, could
we have a conversation later?

03:33.440 --> 03:35.966
There's something important
I need to talk to you about.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.483
Sure, okay.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.121
Okay.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.725
Telephone.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.167
Hey, Jess.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.244
I ate a whole
coffee cake last night.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.367
Pilates?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.044
No, I can't.
I have way too much work.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.136
But I've got to tell you, the
strangest thing just happened.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
What?

03:55.200 --> 03:58.647
I think I just caught Henry
totally checking me out,

03:58.720 --> 03:59.801
like twice.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.487
Was it like a long stare
or a gawk?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.683
Jesse, you've got to see this!

04:06.800 --> 04:09.167
I'm going to say like a gawk.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.401
What does that mean?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.816
I have no idea, but he said he
wants to sit down with me later

04:14.840 --> 04:17.366
and talk about
something important.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.444
What if he wants to
get back together?

04:19.519 --> 04:20.726
<i>What? No. No way.</i>

04:20.800 --> 04:21.926
I'm coming, I'm coming.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.286
That is so not happening.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.930
<i>Why not'?
Jesse.</i>

04:25.000 --> 04:27.810
You are the happiest
divorced couple I've ever met.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.644
I mean, maybe he's
figured you're the one.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.643
Max, get ready,
my sister's coming.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.451
No, no, no, no, no, no,
there's no way.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.603
That's not going to... It's been
years, it's all fine and...

04:37.680 --> 04:39.416
You don't really...
Really, you think it might be?

04:39.440 --> 04:41.442
<i>Do you think?
Here's what I'm wondering.</i>

04:41.640 --> 04:45.440
If you guys get remarried, does it
mean the ring has to be bigger?

04:45.520 --> 04:47.124
I'm saying yes.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.844
Okay, you just keep
thinking all of those

04:48.920 --> 04:50.445
wonderfully deep thoughts, okay?

04:50.560 --> 04:52.050
I'll talk to you later.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.043
Okay.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.003
Presenting our float
for the Mother's Day parade.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.565
Oh!

05:06.600 --> 05:07.726
Wow!

05:07.960 --> 05:09.849
Do you love it?
What is it?

05:09.920 --> 05:13.288
Womb. It's a womb.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.210
Of course.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.765
It's a womb float.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.764
Amazing. And so,
thetube?

05:20.880 --> 05:21.881
The umbilical cord.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.327
It's symbolic that we all
come from the same place,

05:24.400 --> 05:27.483
gay, straight, transgender,
black, white, purple, you know.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.686
Awesome.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.885
I love it.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.207
You're going to kill it
at the Mother's Day parade.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.136
Seriously, they're not going
to know what to do with it.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.491
You haven't seen the best part.

05:38.600 --> 05:43.208
Oh, look at that! I delivered
a child for the second time.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.841
Wow! It's a boy.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.365
You've lost your mind.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.000
I'm going to go work out.
I'll be right over here.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.521
You good?

05:54.600 --> 05:55.601
All good, Val.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.281
Hey, Zack.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.680
Another week,
you won't need the tray.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.736
Another week, and you and
Kristin will be doing my shift.

06:01.760 --> 06:02.760
Hey, Val.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.888
Hey, Kristin. Hey.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.450
Hi. Daddy!

06:06.800 --> 06:07.801
Ooh.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.723
No, no, no, we sanitize.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.080
I literallyjust washed my hands.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.201
Doesn't matter.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.964
I could always
wear a hazmat suit.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.610
I'd love that.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.762
The baby books call that
being a helicopter mom.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.966
You know, always hovering.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.296
Yeah, I've been called them all,

06:20.320 --> 06:21.560
and it doesn't faze me one bit.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.485
Milk bottles for tonight.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.400
Can you put those in the
fridge for me, please?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.244
Um, that may not work.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.321
I just found out...

06:30.400 --> 06:32.209
Hey, Zack, can I get two more?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.642
Yep, on the way. Beanzie?

06:35.120 --> 06:37.885
I got accepted into the Buckhead
Standup Comedy Contest.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.128
First round's tonight,
three rounds,

06:40.200 --> 06:41.531
first prize is 5 grand.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.728
Babe, that would take my overall
earnings as a comic to,

06:45.840 --> 06:47.001
well, 5 grand.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.162
Just getting accepted into
the contest is a big deal.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.336
Yeah, of course, I will figure
something out with Katie.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.408
Don't worry.
Just go make 'em laugh.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.762
I'm not paying you
to reproduce again.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.841
Sorry, boss.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.127
But don't mind me,
I'm just the owner.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.769
Vicky,
don't kick the ball in here.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.251
Okay, Okay-

07:12.000 --> 07:13.365
Thank you.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.682
Can't believe it's
already been a year.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.880
This will be our
first one without her.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.091
I miss her.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.086
Me, too.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.371
Who's that?

07:38.440 --> 07:40.602
Just a friend,
wondering if I'll be

07:40.680 --> 07:42.728
at the mall today after school.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.926
I've got to answer him.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.285
Is this "him" your,
uh, boyfriend?

07:48.400 --> 07:49.640
Dad, stop. Please.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.721
What?
Oh, my God.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.131
Seems like a reasonable question

07:52.240 --> 07:54.004
for a father to
ask his daughter.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.809
Hey, Vicky,
you know, we should go.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.370
We're going to be
late for school,

07:57.440 --> 07:59.841
and you, don't be late
for soccer practice this time.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.446
I won't.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.881
Mom was never late for practice.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.211
No, she wasn't.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.085
Can I drive?

08:19.480 --> 08:20.766
Absolutely not.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.416
No, look, we're all going to end
up in a place like this someday.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.800
All right?
I don't want to rush it.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.727
What?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.690
That was just like
the old Dad, making jokes.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.725
Yeah, I guess.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.851
So, listen, Dad.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.366
After I get my license,
could I maybe, you know,

08:36.440 --> 08:38.124
drive Mom's Volkswagen?

08:38.520 --> 08:40.456
No, no, no, I'm going to sell it.
I told you that.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.890
Come on, Dad.
Pretty please?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.729
It's literallyjust
sitting in the garage.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.211
Absolutely not.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.571
Well, thanks for
thinking that over. Great.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.407
I'm Adam Freeman.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.245
Thanks for joining me here
on HSN from our headquarters

08:54.320 --> 08:56.084
in St. Petersburg, Florida.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.243
<i>Right now, I would like to send
it over to Atlanta, Georgia,</i>

08:59.320 --> 09:02.164
<i>where the very lovely Miranda
Collins is on her book tour.</i>

09:02.240 --> 09:03.571
Hello, Adam.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.721
Hello, Atlanta.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.211
Hello, viewers.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.806
So, Mother's Day
is getting so close,

09:08.880 --> 09:12.965
and we have these gorgeous
crystal mood pendants.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.005
It is the perfect gift for Mom.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.243
These genuine quartz
crystal mood pendants

09:18.320 --> 09:20.482
change color with your mood.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.483
Now, wouldn't it be nice to know

09:22.560 --> 09:26.007
if your mom is
happy or sad or mad?

09:27.440 --> 09:30.011
Oh, we have just sold
our 800th pendant!

09:30.080 --> 09:31.127
BingQ!

09:34.760 --> 09:37.161
Oh, God, I know that look.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.766
You hate the float.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.491
No, it's not the float.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.205
It's just all this
Mother's Day stuff

09:44.280 --> 09:46.296
and I start thinking about
how I haven't talked to Mom.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.370
I don't even remember what our
stupid argument was about.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.805
Oh, let me refresh your memory.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.416
She saw a picture of you
and Russell on Facebook,

09:53.440 --> 09:56.125
and even though he's a doctor,
she threatened to disown you

09:56.240 --> 09:59.210
if you continue to date a man whose
skin was darker than a Frappuccino.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.203
Okay, I get it.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.171
Look, you can always call her,

10:05.240 --> 10:08.084
not that I understand why you
would want to, or Skype.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.605
She's into that now.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.603
Our parents have the Internet?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.603
How do they do that
with a rotary phone?

10:13.680 --> 10:16.160
Hmm. Fancier trailer park?

10:16.720 --> 10:19.405
Well, when are you planning on
telling them about you and Max?

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
Never

10:21.080 --> 10:22.736
I'm engaged to an investment
banker named Steven.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.920
We have not set the date yet.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.336
He has low sperm count
and I'm in therapy.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.361
That's my story.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.570
Maybe if you tell them about you two
first, it'll soften the blow for me.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.169
Don't even try to piggyback
your secret on my secret.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.607
Besides, she's in Texas.
We're fine.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.530
Yeah, we're fine,

10:39.920 --> 10:42.161
just motherless
this time of year.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.288
There's a reason we
moved here to Georgia.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.805
She ruins everything, remember?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.406
I mean, at least
everything we let her.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.842
I just feel like
we don't have family.

10:52.160 --> 10:55.130
I'm your sister.
I live next door to you.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.844
Thank you very much.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.761
Thanks.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.001
Little hot, careful.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.121
Mmm.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.165
It's really hot.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.124
What did you want to talk about?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.771
Sounded so important.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.365
Uh...

11:25.640 --> 11:27.529
Oh, my God, what is it?

11:27.600 --> 11:28.931
I, uh...

11:31.520 --> 11:32.521
I, um...

11:33.440 --> 11:34.805
I got married.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.126
Eloped, actually.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.405
Very impulsive.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.040
You got married?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.281
Yeah.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.688
You got... To who?

11:49.880 --> 11:51.291
To Tina.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.921
To Tina?

11:53.200 --> 11:54.326
Yeah, to Tina.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.481
To Tina?

11:56.920 --> 11:57.921
Stop saying, "To Tina."

11:58.000 --> 12:03.040
I'm sorry,
I'm so confused right now.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.726
I mean, I thought
you guys broke up so long ago.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.801
We did.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.685
But then there
was that stripper.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.650
Dancer, yeah.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.841
Stripper.

12:11.960 --> 12:16.249
And then, Tina and I
got back together.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.090
How does this...

12:18.160 --> 12:19.650
Wow. You got back together.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.330
She's the one.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.281
Ah.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.931
Well, let's say the next one.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.847
Right.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.082
You know, I've always respected
the agreement we've had

12:35.160 --> 12:36.810
to keep our love lives separate

12:36.880 --> 12:38.962
until they become permanent,

12:39.040 --> 12:41.691
which now it has.

12:42.040 --> 12:47.444
Okay, so,
when do we tell the boys?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.488
Oh, I already told them
on the way to school.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.768
What? You already told them?

12:53.840 --> 12:54.966
Yeah.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.649
On the way to school, with those
other children in the car?

12:58.720 --> 13:01.929
No, I waited till
those kids got out.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.650
Oh, you did, good.
That's good.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.685
So, that was a really nice,
well-thought-out moment for you guys.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.888
That's nice.
Thanks for waiting for me.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.243
They were excited.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.569
They know her.
They really like her.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.486
Okay-

13:19.520 --> 13:21.568
Well...

13:24.040 --> 13:26.964
Oh, gosh, I have to, um...

13:27.040 --> 13:29.168
I have to meet Jess at Pilates.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.651
Sorry, I don't mean to...

13:30.720 --> 13:32.131
No, no, no.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.696
I wanted to make sure
you heard it from me first.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.245
Yes, I know, I know.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.240
Okay, well, um...

13:39.240 --> 13:40.241
Uh...

13:41.040 --> 13:42.610
I'm happy for you.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.371
Thank you.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.760
Hi, Bradley. Are you going to
join us on the poles today?

14:06.840 --> 14:08.922
Uh, not today, Beth Anne, no.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.286
Sisters.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.730
We want to talk to you.
Go, Jody.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.883
Bradley, there's this new mom at
school we want to set you up with.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.041
She's recently divorced.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.121
Not too recent.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.124
With one of those annoyingly
perfect lives-at-the-gym bodies.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.526
But with boobs, big boobs.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.641
I mean big boobs.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.085
Look, ladies,
I really appreciate

14:34.160 --> 14:35.889
you looking out
for me like this,

14:35.960 --> 14:38.361
but I just don't think
I'm ready quite yet, you know?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.640
But when I am, I will definitely
come talk to you guys.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.170
It'd be dumb not to.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.244
What are your plans
for Mother's Day?

14:44.800 --> 14:45.801
Oh, um...

14:46.920 --> 14:49.764
No plans.
We're not celebrating.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.930
I've been thinking about this
long and hard and believe me,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.729
I think what's
best for the girls

14:54.800 --> 14:56.564
is to just skip
the day altogether.

14:56.640 --> 15:00.486
You know, just treat it like a normal
Sunday, nothing special. You know?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.642
What do you guys
think about that?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.841
Absolutely not. No.
Major mistake, Bradley.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.646
Dana would not like that.
Think about the kids.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.925
You guys, look! It's Miranda!

15:11.040 --> 15:12.416
<i>Am I really on with
the Miranda Collins?</i>

15:12.440 --> 15:15.330
<i>Am I really on with
the Edith from Waukesha?</i>

15:15.400 --> 15:16.481
<i>Go ahead, Edith.</i>

15:16.600 --> 15:19.171
<i>Could I see the
bracelet</i> a <i>bit closer, please?</i>

15:21.160 --> 15:22.400
My pleasure.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.604
How's that, Edith?

15:26.680 --> 15:29.411
<i>Ooh, that's lovely.
I'll take two.</i>

15:29.520 --> 15:32.364
And it won't cost you an arm and a leg.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.050
Perfect. GOOd.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.605
Nice crisp passes, guys!

15:36.680 --> 15:39.445
My morn said your mom was
lieutenant in the Marines

15:39.520 --> 15:41.124
and your dad was a Marine, too?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.964
Yeah, he was a master sergeant.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.485
Come on, we've got to hustle.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.846
He sure knows how to yell.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.016
Kick it to where they're going
to be, not where they are

15:48.040 --> 15:50.360
becausetheyfl be gone from there
by the time it gets there!

15:50.400 --> 15:52.129
<i>Leaner, come on, Rash.</i>

15:52.200 --> 15:53.645
Case in point!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.604
Rachel, you've got
to hustle. Come on.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.806
Hey!

15:56.880 --> 15:59.042
Thank you, Vicky.
Thank you for your help.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.565
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:00.640 --> 16:03.041
Hey, Evelyn, what are you doing?

16:03.200 --> 16:05.168
Are you texting?
Are you?

16:05.440 --> 16:07.522
Yeah, there's no
texting in soccer, okay?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.444
I mean, there's running
and jumping, eye contact,

16:10.520 --> 16:11.806
laughing, there's even crying.

16:11.880 --> 16:12.927
There's no texting.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.525
Please, put that away,
all right?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.045
Hey, hey, hey!

16:18.840 --> 16:20.080
What?

16:20.160 --> 16:21.730
Thomas is watching you.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.966
Yeah, watching me
screw up, thank you.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.205
Back to soccer!

16:31.760 --> 16:33.524
Iguessthafs
Tommy there, all right.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.770
Let's go!

16:36.080 --> 16:37.923
All right,
go, let's go! Come on!

16:38.920 --> 16:40.126
Here we go.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.327
Nice!

16:41.400 --> 16:43.801
Rachel's open!
Chase it down, that's it.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.646
Hey, goal!

16:46.720 --> 16:47.960
Nicely done.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.283
Evelyn, please text my daughter,
"Good job." Thank you.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.042
She is online.
You ready?

16:54.120 --> 16:55.804
Yeah, I'm ready.
Oh.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.169
Take that down.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.280
Hey, Ma, it's Gabi.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.604
Can you read me?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.442
<i>GABY. Not a walkie-talkie,
Mom.</i>

17:09.160 --> 17:11.685
I thought this Escape thing is
supposed to let me see people.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.847
I don't see diddly.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.890
<i>It's "Skype," not "Escape."
Now just press "start video."</i>

17:15.960 --> 17:17.007
<i>I did.</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:19.367
Try again. Click the
picture of the video camera.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.885
Well, I don't have one of them.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.165
<i>GABY. Yes, you do, Mom.</i>

17:22.240 --> 17:24.766
No, I do not have
a damn picture of a video...

17:25.640 --> 17:27.688
<i>Okay, I did.
GABY. m.</i>

17:27.760 --> 17:29.728
<i>Oh, you got the crystal.
I sent it early.</i>

17:29.800 --> 17:31.802
<i>Didn't want to risk it being
late for Mother's Day.</i>

17:31.920 --> 17:33.524
<i>I know I'd never
hear the end of that.</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:35.086
<i>Oh, I love it.</i>

17:35.320 --> 17:38.210
<i>I'm not so sure about this
color-changing mumbo jumbo.</i>

17:38.280 --> 17:42.205
<i>Oh, and I love that TV
shopping host, Miranda.</i>

17:42.280 --> 17:44.123
<i>Do you know anybody
who knows her?</i>

17:44.200 --> 17:46.009
<i>She's in a hotel in Atlanta.</i>

17:47.040 --> 17:48.644
Uh, no, I don't.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.564
But, um, there's someone
here who knows you.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.525
I can't do it.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.456
You don't have to do it.
Where <i>did</i> she go?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.084
<i>All I see is bricks.</i>

17:58.160 --> 17:59.730
Hello?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.643
<i>Hello?
Uh...</i>

18:02.480 --> 18:04.323
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

18:05.040 --> 18:06.041
Oh.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.521
Do I know you?

18:08.240 --> 18:09.890
<i>It's nice to see you, too.</i>

18:10.040 --> 18:12.930
Finally calling to apologize
after all this time.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.089
Nope, just calling to call.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.084
<i>Gabi told me you're not dating
that Indian fellow anymore.</i>

18:18.200 --> 18:19.611
<i>Finally came to your senses.</i>

18:19.720 --> 18:22.644
<i>But I'm not going to rub your face
in it and say, "I told you so,"</i>

18:22.720 --> 18:24.484
<i>but I told you so.</i>

18:24.560 --> 18:26.085
Okay. Where's Dad?

18:26.600 --> 18:30.002
He's having lunch.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.725
<i>Hi, Dad!</i>

18:31.800 --> 18:33.802
On!

18:33.880 --> 18:37.441
<i>There's my little girl,
on the TV.</i>

18:38.400 --> 18:40.721
<i>I'm glad to see you
talking with your</i> mama.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.882
'Bout time you apologized.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.246
<i>Well, you're looking good, Dad.</i>

18:44.360 --> 18:45.725
No, he thinks so.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.482
Oh, I have to say, Jess,
you haven't aged that much.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.560
Thank you.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.016
<i>How come you can't
find a successful man</i>

18:52.040 --> 18:54.008
<i>like your sister did,
that Steven fellow?</i>

18:54.080 --> 18:56.651
I mean, believe me, I love Gabi,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.961
but she looks way too
much like your father

18:59.040 --> 19:01.042
to be the one to
catch a man first.

19:01.720 --> 19:02.767
Thanks, Mom.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.649
Well, I called to say hi

19:07.720 --> 19:09.484
<i>and I also called to tell you</i>

19:09.560 --> 19:14.600
that no matter what's happened
between us, you're always my mother.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.202
So, I wanted
to tell you about...

19:22.520 --> 19:24.284
<i>What?</i>

19:24.440 --> 19:26.920
Hey, look, it's Mommy
and Aunt Gabi.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.922
I've got to go.
I've got to go.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.096
<i>You want to tell me about what?</i>

19:29.120 --> 19:31.566
- Hi, you wanna see her?
- Hi, guys. Hi.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.205
And she's gone.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.601
Well, at least she called you.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.560
Maybe she got a date.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.563
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, bubs.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.687
Who were you talking to?

19:40.760 --> 19:41.760
Snapchatting.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.370
Oh, what are you, 12?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.930
No, it's fun.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.646
This is so exciting, you guys!

19:49.440 --> 19:53.968
Your first sleepover with
Dad and his new person.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.005
What do you want us to call her?

19:56.080 --> 19:57.844
Do you want us to
call her "Mom," too?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.490
No, absolutely not.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.801
You just call her
what comes naturally,

20:01.920 --> 20:04.127
but I would say "ma'am" is good.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.131
Hey!

20:08.440 --> 20:09.726
What's up, boys?

20:09.800 --> 20:10.961
Hey, Henry.
Yeah?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.041
Hi, Sandy.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.281
Hi, Tina.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.486
Hi, boys.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.484
Hi.
Wow!

20:16.640 --> 20:18.642
Oh, gosh, congratulations.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.162
Thank you.
Isn't it so exciting?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.044
It's thrilling.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.168
I thought you'd
moved back to LA.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.240
Yeah, just for a minute.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.560
Ah. People said I should model.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.324
Yeah.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.568
But somebody convinced
me to move back here.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.410
Boys, I made cookies.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.643
For Peter, guitars,
and for Mikey, baseballs.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.524
Thanks.
Oh. Thanks, Tina.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.761
These are great.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.205
Yeah, come on inside.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.805
Okay, bye, guys-

20:43.880 --> 20:45.120
- Have fun.
- See you tomorrow.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.725
Bye, Sandy.
Oh, um...

20:46.840 --> 20:48.808
Tweet at me if you want
to check in or anything,

20:48.880 --> 20:50.291
or check my lnstagram.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.136
I'll post some photos
when I get some cute ones.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.322
Yeah, that's exciting.
Okay.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.363
"Tweet at me."

21:02.520 --> 21:04.921
She just... Did she just
say, "Tweet at me"? Did she?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.296
I think she just said,
"Tweet me."

21:06.320 --> 21:08.004
I didn't hear that.
Oh, Henry.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.283
Oh, come on.
I knew she was younger, but...

21:10.360 --> 21:11.646
She's almost 30.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.081
"She's almost 30"?
In a few years.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.321
My God.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.084
And what is she wearing?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.771
Uh...

21:19.000 --> 21:20.604
What do you want me to do?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.409
Ask her to dress more dowdy?

21:22.480 --> 21:26.530
No, just tell her to dress,
put on a pair of pants.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.807
That's not appropriate
for those kids.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.450
You can see
everything's popping out.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.124
Speaking of the kids.
What?

21:32.200 --> 21:33.281
Mother's Day.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.283
What about Mother's Day?

21:35.360 --> 21:39.285
I was wondering if we could
take the kids for half the day

21:39.400 --> 21:41.448
since Tina is now technically...

21:41.520 --> 21:42.681
Oh, stop.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.604
No, no, no,
don't even say it, no.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.250
You know what I mean.
No, no, no, no.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.731
You got married
five seconds ago.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.121
Can you just... Can we just
slow this down a little bit?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.440
You're angry.
It's all right.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.727
Well, at least consider
it for the boys' sake.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.484
I just did.
Okay.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.561
You can...

21:57.640 --> 22:00.849
She can have Flag Day,
Groundhog Day,

22:00.920 --> 22:02.922
any of those days, Father's Day.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.204
Well, I was just asking.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.770
Yeah, I know, and you did.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.171
Unbelievable.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.329
I'm sorry to interrupt yourspa,

22:19.440 --> 22:23.081
but Miranda's agent, Lance Wallace,
wants to see you right away.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.884
Lance, I'm here. I'm here.
Okay, okay.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.849
Miranda okays
the book-signing poster,

22:27.920 --> 22:29.763
and the essay winners are ready.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.080
All right, now she wants to
know some interior designers.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.610
She hates the look of the show.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.570
Well, we've gotten a few
requests from some designers.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.816
But this one I liked the best.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.161
Her name is Sandy Newhouse.
All right, why?

22:40.240 --> 22:41.526
She lives in Atlanta.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.080
She's designed living rooms,
upscale restaurants,

22:44.160 --> 22:45.286
and a five-star hotel lobby.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.328
All right, well, she
looks smiley and happy.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.289
Make sure she meets Miranda
before we check out.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.044
Okay, and make-up...
Goal!

22:51.120 --> 22:52.804
Hey, hey, hey!

22:52.960 --> 22:54.371
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey!

22:54.560 --> 22:55.971
Hey there, Messi!

22:56.040 --> 22:57.849
This is not a stadium,
it's a lobby!

22:57.920 --> 22:58.920
No, no, no.
A lobby.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.531
These are the kids of the
big shot HSN executive.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.284
We're entertaining
them this week.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.324
Hey, mister,
can I have my ball back?

23:05.600 --> 23:08.570
There we go.
All right! Soccer rules!

23:08.640 --> 23:09.766
Soccer rules!

23:09.840 --> 23:11.536
Are they gonna be with
us all week, those kids?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.925
Yes, they are.

23:16.240 --> 23:19.528
<i>Doin' it all for my baby</i>

23:21.240 --> 23:24.050
<i>'Cause he's as fine as he can be</i>

23:24.120 --> 23:25.724
<i>Not him, it's you.</i>

23:25.840 --> 23:27.251
Dad, dinner's ready.

23:27.320 --> 23:30.449
<i>Doin' it all for my baby</i>

23:31.000 --> 23:34.209
<i>For everything he does for me</i>

23:34.280 --> 23:37.568
<i>I'm doin' it, doin' it, doin' it</i>

23:37.640 --> 23:38.926
<i>Doin' it, doin' it, yeah</i>

23:39.000 --> 23:41.082
<i>Doin' it, doin' it...</i>

23:41.160 --> 23:42.525
Mom loved karaoke.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.687
Remember?

23:45.760 --> 23:47.808
Oh, yes, I certainly do.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.282
Come on,
let's eat, Dad. Come on.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.600
Let's go.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.841
Come on!

23:52.920 --> 23:54.843
Okay. Okay.
What are you doing?

23:59.200 --> 24:02.647
<i>This karaoke video is
just for you, Bradley.</i>

24:03.560 --> 24:06.848
<i>And to my chubbos back home,
Rachel and Vicky.</i>

24:07.520 --> 24:09.409
<i>I love you so much.</i>

24:09.760 --> 24:12.604
<i>I'll be home before you know it.</i>

24:15.160 --> 24:16.685
<i>Love you.</i>

24:16.760 --> 24:18.091
<i>Love you guys-</i>

24:18.840 --> 24:21.730
Yeah, could you go to the
supermarket for me, please?

24:22.600 --> 24:25.171
Yeah, yeah, of course.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.925
I can, uh“.
Yeah, what, uh...

24:29.560 --> 24:30.800
What do we need?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.962
Uh, we need juice, eggs...
Uh-huh.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.405
Eggs.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.882
Bread, of course.
Yup.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.169
Um, we need bananas and tampons.
Mmm-hmm.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.366
Yeah.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.610
Uh... Um...

24:45.080 --> 24:46.320
What was that?

24:46.400 --> 24:47.401
Tampons.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.721
Maybe that's something
that can wait, you think?

24:49.960 --> 24:52.042
Uh... No.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.326
I'm just going to write

24:53.400 --> 24:54.481
I'll know what that means.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.560
Okay, good.
Mmm-hmm.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.090
Okay, there you go.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.329
Oh, I miss you guys so much.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.721
Mom, we just saw you,
like, two hours ago.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.723
I know, I know, but I love you,

25:03.800 --> 25:05.928
and I miss you
when you're not here.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.247
So... Hey, are you guys sure you
want to stay at Daddy's tonight

25:10.360 --> 25:12.362
because I could...
Bye, Mom.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.726
Okay, bye.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.609
Me, too, I'm in.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.844
- All in.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.331
9h, my gosh.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.368
Oh, I won again.
No way.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.202
<i>So, Mother's Day is coming and twill
be spending it with my mother.</i>

25:37.280 --> 25:39.726
<i>I brought her out
with my most recent boyfriend</i>

25:39.800 --> 25:41.131
<i>and he leaves for the bathroom,</i>

25:41.200 --> 25:43.043

<i>Thank you so much, everyone.</i>

25:51.440 --> 25:53.886
<i>That was Genevieve Joy.</i>

Um, <i>it's</i> not mine.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.927
No, she <i>is,</i> I hope.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.680
<i>She's amazing.
My girlfriend is American,</i>

26:47.760 --> 26:51.048
<i>but she is desperate for our
child to have a British accent.</i>

26:51.240 --> 26:53.925
<i>That's all she wants. She won't
talk to our child, seriously.</i>

26:54.000 --> 26:55.650
<i>I have to read to
Katie every night.</i>

26:55.720 --> 26:57.563
<i>AH the other kids

<i>You notice I say
"girlfriend," five years,</i>

27:04.000 --> 27:07.209
<i>we're still not married, and,
boy, have I asked.</i>

27:07.280 --> 27:09.282
<i>It was a struggle enough
to get her to update</i>

27:09.360 --> 27:11.044
<i>her Facebook
profile from "single. "</i>

27:11.200 --> 27:13.851
<i>I was like, "Five years,
we have a child together.</i>

27:13.920 --> 27:16.685
<i>"Couldn't you at least make
it, 'it's complicated'?"</i>

27:16.760 --> 27:18.171
<i>And it makes it awkward, though,</i>

27:18.280 --> 27:20.123
<i>like, how do you
introduce each other?</i>

27:20.240 --> 27:21.605
<i>When I introduce Kristin,</i>

27:21.680 --> 27:23.842
<i>I introduce her as

<i>- the song of my soul, the mother
of my child. -</i> Aw...

27:27.520 --> 27:29.682

me as her roommate.</i>

27:32.600 --> 27:36.286
<i>And a great big happy almost
Mother's Day to you terrific...</i>

27:38.200 --> 27:39.247
Hey-

27:40.640 --> 27:44.087
Can we, um, just go back to the
not married thing for a sec?

27:44.160 --> 27:46.891
Oh, Come on,
please, lam so tired.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.166
I am so tired.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.370
I love you, Kristin,
and I do want to marry you.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.962
But I think I don't feel like
getting turned down anymore.

28:02.520 --> 28:06.286
There's something you're not
telling me, but you can.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.447
Whatever it is, we'll get
through it, if we're committed.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.685
I don't know.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.965
Zack, I just...

28:16.440 --> 28:18.647
I don't know. Um...

28:20.440 --> 28:22.408
I don't know either.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.962
So, do you want to take a break?

28:27.960 --> 28:31.043
What? No, never.

28:31.120 --> 28:34.806
I just... I need
a little bit more time.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.644
I won't wait forever.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.810
I know, I'll take it.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.723
I'll take it.
Can I have a kiss, too?

28:55.800 --> 28:56.961
Mama wants a kiss.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.851
Oh, thank you.
Mama kiss.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.563
- Mama kiss.
- Mama kiss.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.687
Sandy?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.165
Hi.
Hi.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.521
Hey!

29:05.680 --> 29:07.523
Hi, hi, hi.
Hi, hello.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.409
This is my friend Kristin.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.606
Hey, Kristin.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.696
That's her little one, Katie.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.210
Kristin and I met
at Mommy and Me.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.281
Oh, sweet.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.361
So, how'd it go?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.648
I got the interview.
Great.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.616
I don't know what's going
to happen, but, you know,

29:19.640 --> 29:21.456
at least I... I'm just
hoping to have something

29:21.480 --> 29:23.130
to keep my mind
off of all of the...

29:23.240 --> 29:24.605
- Yeah.
- You know.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.524
So, Sandy's ex-husband
just got remarried...

29:27.600 --> 29:29.125
Oh...
to, like, a 12-year-old.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.440
Oh!
Yeah. So...

29:31.600 --> 29:33.656
Well, I was actually going to say
carpooling and bagging lunches,

29:33.680 --> 29:35.603
- but, you know, or that.
- Okay, I'm sorry!

29:35.680 --> 29:37.125
I'd like to get my mind off of that.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.326
I'm sorry.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.447
I'm sorry!
No, it was just,

29:39.520 --> 29:40.851
we were on the topic of marriage

29:40.880 --> 29:44.726
and she's got cold feet, which is...
Oh...

29:44.840 --> 29:46.604
I get that.
I get that.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.330
So, that's what's happening here.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.640
Yeah.
Hi!

29:49.720 --> 29:51.643
- Yeah, we get it.
- But you know what?

29:51.720 --> 29:54.326
You don't know until you give
it a shot is the truth, right?

29:54.400 --> 29:55.401
Yeah.

29:55.560 --> 30:00.805
Really? Were you, like, sure?
Uh-uh.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.370
Are you ever sure?

30:02.440 --> 30:03.487
I was sure.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.289
You were sure?
You were totally sure?

30:05.360 --> 30:07.840
100%, going Indian all the way.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.404
Huh. I mean, I was 100%
certain I wanted kids.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.284
Yeah, well, that, of course.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.802
I mean, I can't imagine... Just the
other stuff I don't know about.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.160
Well, that's you guys.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.846
I'm not the best person
to be giving marital advice.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.888
No, no, I do need to hear

30:23.960 --> 30:26.122
becauseifsthe divorce
thing that scares me,

30:26.200 --> 30:29.522
because I don't know what that
would be like for her and...

30:29.760 --> 30:32.604
You don't go into a marriage thinking
you're going to get a divorce.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.889
- Obviously.
- Nobody does.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.248
You know, life happens
and if it does,

30:37.360 --> 30:40.011
then you've got a lot
more closet space...

30:40.080 --> 30:41.080
Yeah.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.090
Extra sink, no snoring,
you know, a lot of positives.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.201
Yeah.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.607
You're really just doing what's
best for the kids, right?

30:47.720 --> 30:49.563
And yourself, but the kids.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.042
By the way, your child is
eating sand, if you...

30:52.200 --> 30:53.690
Tanner, don't eat that.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.886
There's cat poop in it.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.120
That's so gross.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.840
What if there is cat poop...
No, he's fine.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
They survive...

31:00.000 --> 31:01.976
Cat poop... and then they
grow up to be just like us.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.685
Yeah, and they have
a very healthy immune system.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.576
- Anyway, I'm going to go to the kids' show.
- Okay.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.416
Hey, if you're going to come,
will you just text me?

31:08.440 --> 31:09.566
It was nice meeting you.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.816
Nice to meet you.
And I'll save you a seat?

31:10.840 --> 31:11.887
Yes.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.200
Okay, or tweet at me.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.725
Yeah, I'll text...
I'll tweet...

31:14.800 --> 31:16.404
What? Tweet you?

31:16.600 --> 31:18.456
- Yeah, see, right? That
didn't sound right. Mmm-mmm.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.164
What is that?
I was just trying it out.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.406
Okay, bye.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.610
Kristin, what's wrong?

31:27.080 --> 31:28.286
What happened?

31:32.920 --> 31:33.920
Are you okay?

31:33.960 --> 31:37.328
I love Zack, but there's a
reason I'm afraid of marriage.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.801
Um...

31:41.760 --> 31:46.846
The truth is I have no
idea who the hell I am.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.411
That's a big one.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.365
I was adopted.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.521
Oh, okay.

31:55.920 --> 31:59.003
And I never met my
biological mother.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.525
You never told me that.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.809
Never told anyone
that, only Zack.

32:05.760 --> 32:10.288
And I've always wondered,
did she just throw me away?

32:10.600 --> 32:14.366
Or, you know, was there a
reason she got rid of me?

32:15.520 --> 32:17.682
Aw.
I have abandonment issues.

32:17.800 --> 32:22.601
Honey, I'm sure you have
a million questions,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.128
but then you know
what you have to do.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.531
You have to find your mother.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.364
I already did.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.450
Then I'm missing the point.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.522
I've no...
What do you mean?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.807
I mean, I have her address,

32:34.880 --> 32:38.362
I just haven't had
the courage to contact her.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.970
I'm really scared.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.883
God, of course. That's...

32:43.360 --> 32:45.408
Who wouldn't be?
I mean, that's crazy.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.881
You don't even know what
she's going to be like.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.650
You don't even know your mother

32:49.720 --> 32:51.404
and she has this power over you.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.251
You're going to have to
face it sooner or later.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.560
You can do it.
Really?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.856
Yes, you should just do it.
Yeah.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.848
You're right, you're
right, you're right.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.922
Okay.
Yeah, and get it over with.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.408
You're, you know...
I mean, now you'll face it.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.376
Yeah, I'm going to do it. You're
right, you're right, you're right.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.482
I'm going to do it. I got it.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.925
You will have it.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.206
Thanks, Jess.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.406
<i>Hi, I'm Bobby Lee,</i>

33:13.480 --> 33:16.962
<i>principal here at Millard
Fillmore Middle School.</i>

33:17.040 --> 33:18.769
<i>And we're really
excited about this show.</i>

33:18.840 --> 33:19.896
<i>We're gonna start
in a few minutes.</i>

33:19.920 --> 33:21.656
<i>The kids are very excited and
later, we're going to be...</i>

33:21.680 --> 33:22.841
Sandy, hL

33:22.920 --> 33:25.491
<i>featuring the Fillmore band in concert.
How about that?</i>

33:25.560 --> 33:26.607
What are you doing here?

33:26.680 --> 33:29.160
I didn't think
you'd mind. Here.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.571
I kind of mind.

33:30.680 --> 33:31.920
I had to hear Peter's riff.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.376
We were up late last
night working on it.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.811
You were
working on Peter's riff?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.843
Yeah, I was in an
all-girl band in high school.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.968
My gosh, Peter's gotten so good.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.696
You know, we just want
to encourage his music,

33:40.720 --> 33:43.576
so we're taking the boys to the Foo
Fighters concert this weekend. But...

33:43.600 --> 33:44.920
What? Don't say
anything to Peter.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.371
It's a surprise.

33:46.440 --> 33:49.603
And don't even get me
started on Dave Grohl.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.767
Don't tell Henry.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.601
Okay, Tina, Tina, Tina,
Tina, that's it.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.370
I'm done. I'm done
with surprises.

33:56.440 --> 34:00.206
I really am. This week,
enough surprises, seriously.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.850
Okay, is something wrong?

34:01.920 --> 34:03.410
Yes, something is wrong.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.729
I got here an hour early, so I
could get a front row seat,

34:06.800 --> 34:10.407
and have a perfect camera
angle and watch my children.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.322
And now you're sitting
right here next to me.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.889
Because the seat was open.

34:13.960 --> 34:18.170
It was for my purse, my purse's seat, okay?
My purse's seat is right here.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.561
God, you cannot just show up
here late and then sit there.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.641
You just can't
do that. We need...

34:25.719 --> 34:27.085
We need boundaries.

34:27.159 --> 34:28.446
We need some rules, Tina.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.641
Rules?

34:29.719 --> 34:31.768
Like, sitting in an open seat?

34:31.880 --> 34:33.928
I don't know what
the rules are yet, Tina.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.976
I don't know what they are,
but I just know we have them,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.728
and you're breaking all of them.
Okay.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.295
<i>- I've just gotta get...
- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34:39.320 --> 34:41.208
<i>Animals on Parade!</i>

34:41.360 --> 34:46.685
<i>Old MacDonald
had</i> a <i>farm Ee I</i> ee <i>I oh</i>

34:47.360 --> 34:50.569
<i>And on his farm
he had a penguin...</i>

34:50.639 --> 34:52.641
<i>What, Why?</i>

34:52.840 --> 34:55.446
<i>He also had a helper, it seems.</i>

34:55.600 --> 34:57.364
Oh, there's Mikey.
Hi, honey.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.211
<i>A lion! He's got</i> a...

35:00.680 --> 35:03.445
Oh, my God, the
costume's on backwards.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.965
<i>He had a lion...</i>

35:07.840 --> 35:09.046
Did you do that?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.041
Peter.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.920
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.361
<i>Eeleeloh</i>

35:20.360 --> 35:21.521
Yeah, that's good.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.688
The producers have asked
to push the crystals.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.205
Traffic has slowed down.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.801
Five, four, three, two...

35:31.320 --> 35:32.924
Welcome back, everyone.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.809
All right, dads and husbands,

35:34.880 --> 35:38.248
take a look at these
beautiful mood pendants.

35:38.320 --> 35:41.767
Mother's Day, just a few days
away, this is your chance.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.690
And we're clear.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.650
<i>We need a price check
on organic cotton...</i>

35:58.400 --> 35:59.686
No, that's not necessary.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.564
They are...
They're 9 bucks.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.125
They're 9 bucks each.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.602
<i>Cancel that price check on
tampons, the organic cotton ones.</i>

36:08.680 --> 36:09.681
Daughter?

36:11.560 --> 36:13.528
Oh, uh, yeah.

36:14.160 --> 36:18.529
Two actually, but only one is
currently, you know, becoming a woman.

36:19.480 --> 36:20.481
Got you.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.481
Yeah, their mom
used to do this, but...

36:26.440 --> 36:27.646
Well, I do it now.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.849
Same boat, two sons.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.609
How is that the same boat?

36:34.800 --> 36:38.043
I guess just the number.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.408
Sorry, I don't usually eavesdrop
on other people's carts.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.007
It's just... I'm Sandy,
I have two sons.

36:47.800 --> 36:48.881
I already said that.

36:49.640 --> 36:50.641
Yes, you did.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.768
I can take you over here.
Oh, thank you.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.647
Sandy, two sons, same boat.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.121
Oh, thank you.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.770
All right, well, bye.

37:01.960 --> 37:05.043
Yeah, it was nice meeting you,
Sandy with two sons.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.650
It was two, right?

37:07.240 --> 37:08.321
Yeah.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.210
Hey, Henry, what's up?

37:15.800 --> 37:18.406
Hey, are the boys'
passports up to date?

37:20.720 --> 37:22.802
Their passports?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.367
I am planning our
summer vacation.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.647
Um...

37:27.520 --> 37:32.845
Okay, where are you
planning this vacation?

37:33.160 --> 37:35.970
We're going to Paris.
Tina's never been.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.568
Paris, uh, France?

37:39.160 --> 37:40.161
Uh-huh.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.845
<i>SANDY". Are you kidding me?</i>

37:42.360 --> 37:44.647
No, I'm not. Why?

37:44.720 --> 37:46.085
I got to go.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.526
Bye.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.361
Hello?

37:52.400 --> 37:53.526
Hello?

37:55.680 --> 37:57.682
So, how'd she take it?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.451
Like a champ.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.770
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

38:06.520 --> 38:08.522
Paris?

38:09.360 --> 38:11.362
Paris, Paris, Paris!

38:11.640 --> 38:12.641
<i>That's...</i>

38:13.040 --> 38:17.250
We could not get our shit together
for 13 years to get to Paris.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.122
Now he's taking Tina. Tina.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.884
Now he's taking Tina.

38:23.360 --> 38:27.126
It's the only place I've wanted to go
since I was a kid and I read <i>Madeline!</i>

38:27.400 --> 38:29.846
I don't even think she knows
who the hell Madeline is!

38:30.280 --> 38:34.046
Oh, my God,
this is not happening!

38:34.120 --> 38:36.009
This is not happening!

38:37.720 --> 38:41.247
Oh, man, you know, you couldn't
have taken her to London

38:41.320 --> 38:44.403
or to fuckin' Disneyland maybe?

38:44.480 --> 38:47.006
I don't know, how about
take her to the prom?

38:47.080 --> 38:49.606
That's somewhere I bet
she hasn't been yet.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.121
Jesus“.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.721
Freaking Tina!

38:58.920 --> 39:00.251
I'd hate to see her in traffic.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.606
Yeah.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.840
That's it.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.251
That's it, go!

39:09.440 --> 39:10.441
Over here!

39:11.320 --> 39:12.367
Cross it!

39:13.760 --> 39:15.603
That's it. Rachel's open.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.489
There you go. That's it.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.047
Yeah, move it!

39:19.120 --> 39:20.121
Hurry!

39:23.200 --> 39:24.611
Goal!

39:29.240 --> 39:31.561
Did not cross
the line! No goal!

39:31.680 --> 39:34.524
What? What? What are
you talking about?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.846
Go back to your coaching area!

39:35.920 --> 39:37.922
No, no, no, no, notunfilyou
reverse that call, man.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.047
I'm warning you.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.088
Hey, you're warning me what?
Look at the crowd.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.204
Easy, mister.
I've got this, Lisa.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.416
What? There's not
many of them.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.487
No, no, look at them.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.645
Okay, you've got,
like, five dozen

39:47.720 --> 39:49.216
different recorded
versions of that play

39:49.240 --> 39:50.765
you completely
missed right there.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.171
Why don't you
just walk over there

39:52.240 --> 39:53.496
and ask one of them
to replay it for you,

39:53.520 --> 39:54.936
then you'll see you're wrong,
we'll win the game

39:54.960 --> 39:57.122
and then you can stumble home
with your seeing-eye dog.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.611
That's it.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.081
Yellow card!

40:01.280 --> 40:02.691
Yellow card?
Are you...

40:03.680 --> 40:05.045
Oh, he blew
another man's whistle.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.616
Did you just blow my whistle?
You're damn right.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.976
You do not blow
another man's whistle.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.082
You do when he
blows the game for you!

40:10.160 --> 40:12.811
All right, that's it, red card!

40:13.200 --> 40:14.201
You're gone.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.970
I'm gone? Okay,
good to know.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.690
Okay, you know what?
I'm gone.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.168
Now your ball's gone.
That's what's gone, okay?

40:20.280 --> 40:21.327
Hey, Kimberly!

40:21.840 --> 40:22.921
Oh, I've got to go!

40:23.000 --> 40:25.082
- You take over, okay?
- Yeah, you better go.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.776
Yeah, thank you. If
anybody's looking for me,

40:26.800 --> 40:29.201
I'll be out in the parking lot
calling LensCrafters,

40:29.320 --> 40:30.845
making that guy an appointment!

40:31.360 --> 40:33.160
Baby, you better go.
You're going to get hurt.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.245
Spare ball, please.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.521
Knucklehead!

40:43.680 --> 40:46.206
All right, you're gone.

40:47.680 --> 40:51.048
You... A pox
upon your whistle.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.486
Play ball!

40:56.040 --> 40:57.087
Next.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.683
Yeah, hi. Could we
get a large pizza?

41:00.760 --> 41:02.649
What kind you want?
Cheese.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.561
Large cheese pizza
and three sodas to go.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.045
Wait over there, please.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.205
Where'd you hear that "pox on my whistle"?
What's that from?

41:11.360 --> 41:13.283
Shakespeare.
Shakespeare, huh?

41:13.400 --> 41:14.606
William Shakespeare?

41:14.720 --> 41:16.085
No, Bob Shakespeare.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.287
Who else would it...

41:17.400 --> 41:18.890
Why are you talking
to me like this?

41:19.880 --> 41:21.086
You, too, now?

41:21.600 --> 41:22.806
I can't believe we lost.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.056
I think that ball was deflated.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.127
WOMAN 13 Totally.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.486
Tom Brady is hot.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.681
Hey, want to go
get some ice cream?

41:31.800 --> 41:33.165
As a makeup present?

41:33.280 --> 41:34.406
Make up for what?

41:34.560 --> 41:36.483
Acting like Mopey Dick
half the time.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.925
I'm sorry, Mopey Dick?

41:38.520 --> 41:41.490
Yeah, being sad all the time,

41:41.600 --> 41:45.571
obsessing over soccer so
you can get closer to Mom,

41:46.480 --> 41:49.450
watching those
videos over and over.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.325
She's gone, Dad, and we're
all sad, but for how long?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.776
And acting like an asshole with
that ref doesn't help anyone.

41:57.800 --> 41:58.847
Hey, watch your language.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.251
You know what?
Yeah, I cuss.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.288
That's because I'm
an unsupervised teen

42:02.360 --> 42:04.256
and while I'm at it, I don't
mind taking care of Vicky

42:04.280 --> 42:06.089
and doing all the housework
and the cooking.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.401
Dad, I'm only 16, I have a life.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.891
I know, okay?

42:11.920 --> 42:13.809
Tommy's here.
I've got to go.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.648
Wait, where are you going?
Just stop.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.403
Is this the boy that likes you?

42:19.480 --> 42:21.403
Hey, Rachel, what are you doing?

42:22.240 --> 42:23.446
Go, come on.

42:23.560 --> 42:24.721
Rachel, get out of the car.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.887
Get out.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.008
You're going to roll
up the window on me.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.522
Hey, wait until it stops
and then get out of the car.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.645
Unbelievable.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.922
<i>But my friend comes
to me and she goes,</i>

42:40.000 --> 42:44.085
<i>"Oh, my God, Mia, I have met
the perfect guy for you."</i>

42:44.160 --> 42:48.370
<i>She shows me his picture, and
this dude was at least 75, okay?</i>

42:50.160 --> 42:51.321
<i>And I am not.</i>

42:53.000 --> 42:56.004
<i>And I said, "Um, his eyes
have cataracts,</i>

42:57.520 --> 42:59.568
<i>"mine have hope, okay?"</i>

43:04.200 --> 43:05.645
She is killing 'em.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.084
She's also killing the boss.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.330
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Are you okay?

43:38.400 --> 43:40.129
Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.616
Do you know where the pool is?
I'm looking for Miranda Collins.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.696
Yeah, it's right
through that door.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.600
- But, can I help you with the rip?
- No, I'm...

43:45.840 --> 43:47.336
Sorry, watch out behind you.
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

43:47.360 --> 43:49.203
Thank you. You sure I
can't help with the rip?

43:49.320 --> 43:50.560
I got a safety pin.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.842
No, no, thank you,
I'm late for a meeting.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.009
Bigger smile.
Bigger smile, yeah.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.082
There you go. Perfect.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.770
Have a nice day.
Next.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Thank you.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.849
Congratulations.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.843
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no! ShooH

44:04.280 --> 44:05.327
One more.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.210
Ma'am, these are contest winners.
Only they get pictures.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.816
I'm not... I'm actually
not here for a picture.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.126
I'm here to show Miranda this.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.287
Fine, stay here.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.736
But, there's actually...
Hey, hey, hey!

44:13.760 --> 44:14.761
How cute.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.001
That's very sweet.
Miranda!

44:16.080 --> 44:17.923
I'm sorry, that's...
Congratulations.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.610
I'm not a contest winner.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.000
Then why am I hugging you?

44:21.080 --> 44:23.208
I'm sorry. I'm late.
I'm here for the interview.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.376
We're not doing any press today.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.520
No. I'm not
interviewing you.

44:25.600 --> 44:27.056
She's interviewing me.
You need to calm down.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.560
I need to calm down?
I'm not here for a photograph.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.165
I'm here for a job.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.446
Oh, you must be Sandy.

44:32.520 --> 44:33.601
Yes, I'm Sandy!

44:33.680 --> 44:35.682
Yes! Well, you missed
the design meeting.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.896
Miranda is a very busy person.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.251
Oh, really?
Is Miranda busy?

44:38.800 --> 44:40.484
Well, I would have
been here on time

44:40.560 --> 44:42.130
if my ex-husband
hadn't married a tween,

44:42.280 --> 44:45.841
or if my doctor had called in
my child's asthma medication,

44:45.920 --> 44:47.490
or if my mother-mobile
went faster

44:47.560 --> 44:49.085
than 4 miles per
hour on the freeway.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.250
But I understand it. I get it.
Her time is very valuable.

44:52.320 --> 44:55.449
And she's very busy.
My time is not.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.448
My bra's on inside out.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.096
Would you like me
to help you with your bra?

45:04.120 --> 45:06.441
No! Uh... Thank you, though.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.365
I like your blouse.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.009
Thank you. I just made this.

45:16.280 --> 45:17.361
Next.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.926
Look at me, look right here.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.281
It's not a date. Oh, just...

45:27.320 --> 45:28.401
Great.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.005
That's a waste of my time.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.004
Oh, I'm Miranda. I'm the
busiest woman in the world.

45:33.640 --> 45:34.801
Where is she, Betty?

45:34.880 --> 45:36.484
There she is,
talking to herself.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.881
Thanks, Betty.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.163
Excuse me, ma'am.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.446
I'm sorry, Miss Collins
would like to see you now.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.891
She would?
Yes.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.401
Okay-

45:48.480 --> 45:49.891
Oh, shoot!

45:50.240 --> 45:51.241
Um...

45:51.960 --> 45:53.689
One second, one second.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.044
Can I help you with something?

45:57.880 --> 45:59.616
Watch yourself.
Don't get stuck in there now.

45:59.640 --> 46:00.641
Would you...
Okay, sure.

46:00.720 --> 46:01.767
I got it. I got it.
Yep.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.330
Okay?
Yes, I got it.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.289
You sure you got everything?
Hello in there.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.456
You want this back?
No, no, no.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.686
No, okay.

46:09.560 --> 46:14.646
Uh, okay, so,
I was trying to create

46:14.720 --> 46:17.485
a little bit more
flow and, um...

46:19.680 --> 46:22.047
Gosh, your head just really
snapped right off there.

46:22.120 --> 46:23.121
Anyhow.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.044
So, that's why I kind of
rounded out these edges

46:26.240 --> 46:27.571
a little bit and openeditup.

46:27.720 --> 46:28.721
And also, um...

46:28.840 --> 46:30.524
How long has
your son had asthma?

46:32.720 --> 46:34.245
His whole life.

46:35.040 --> 46:38.283
But the doctors say that they
can grow out of it sometimes.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.730
Do you have kids?
No.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.011
Career.
Sure.

46:45.080 --> 46:46.081
Keeps me busy.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.727
Yeah, of course.

46:49.600 --> 46:54.083
Tell me more about this
tween and your ex-husband.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.489
Oh, yeah.

46:56.560 --> 46:59.245
Oh, I'm sure I exaggerated
about that a little bit.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.284
I'm sure she's older,
but I'll have a better idea

47:02.400 --> 47:03.845
once all the acne clears up.

47:05.920 --> 47:07.285
You're funny.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.203
You have to be
more fun than she is.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.124
I am, lam.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.968
Well, you should hold on to that.
Yeah.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.401
Yeah.

47:18.920 --> 47:22.288
Okay, I feel like I should keep
pitching you my... The set, so...

47:22.400 --> 47:24.562
No, not at all.
You're hired.

47:25.560 --> 47:27.369
That's it?
Mmm-hmm.

47:27.440 --> 47:30.205
And I dare say with this new
job, you might be able to afford

47:30.280 --> 47:31.611
a slightly faster car.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.846
Not a Maserati,
but slightly faster car.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.366
I'm so sorry for that
explosion out there.

47:37.440 --> 47:40.250
Don't be. it got our
attention, didn't it?

47:40.320 --> 47:42.163
Also a trait to hold on to.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.404
Okay, thank you.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.768
I'll hold on to that, and
I'm funny... I've a lot to hold on to.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.320
I know that you're
very busy, Miranda, so...

47:50.440 --> 47:52.010
One last thing.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.851
There is one final
souvenir to give away,

47:54.960 --> 47:57.645
though you were not
an essay-contest winner.

47:58.960 --> 48:02.009
Thank you. 100% gold-plated
hypoallergenic bangle.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.121
Oh.
Just for you.

48:03.480 --> 48:06.165
Oh, my gosh.
This has been a great day.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.491
Jess, our blender's broken.
We're using yours.

48:12.600 --> 48:13.726
Okay-
Hey.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.801
Hi.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.120
Where's Russell and the kids?

48:16.200 --> 48:19.488
Oh, they're out in the garage popping
the bubble wrap on the float.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.490
It's them. You answer it.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
It's your Skype.

48:25.640 --> 48:26.687
It's your parents.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.091
<i>GABY. Your parents, too.</i>

48:28.160 --> 48:29.241
You know what?

48:29.320 --> 48:32.085
This is something that I can do for
you, is answer and talk to them.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.924
Thank you.
But I'd rather do this.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.083
Oh, my God.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.120
Dad.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.681
<i>Hi, Jess.</i>

48:40.800 --> 48:44.122
<i>I want to talk to you about a
Mother's Day present for my old lady.</i>

48:44.320 --> 48:45.321
Uh...

48:45.880 --> 48:49.282
The old lady, meaning my mother?

48:49.360 --> 48:52.364
<i>Yeah, I've got the greatest
idea in the world.</i>

48:52.440 --> 48:53.441
Okay-

48:53.520 --> 48:57.127
<i>A present that's going to knock
your mama plum out of her panties.</i>

48:57.200 --> 48:58.201
Whoo!

48:58.560 --> 49:01.643
Dad, that is a really
interesting visual.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.563
<i>What are you guys talking about?</i>

49:03.680 --> 49:06.604
Mom, I thought... Dad, I thought
you wanted it to be a surprise?

49:06.680 --> 49:08.364
<i>Oh, it Will be.</i>

49:08.480 --> 49:10.209
Come in, door's open.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.241
Hello?

49:13.480 --> 49:14.891
Hello? Dad?

49:15.320 --> 49:16.481
Surprise!

49:17.520 --> 49:19.727
Oh, my God!
That was... What?

49:20.600 --> 49:22.045
What?

49:24.240 --> 49:27.847
Yes, you have that here now.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.888
That's crazy.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.001
<i>Gab“.!</i>

49:33.720 --> 49:35.051
<i>Gab“.!</i>

49:35.560 --> 49:36.925
Oh, it's you GUYS-

49:37.000 --> 49:38.206
Yeah, it is!

49:39.680 --> 49:41.170
Oh, sweetheart.

49:41.240 --> 49:42.810
Gabi, you're not
going to believe it.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.850
You guys are
supposed to be in Texas.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.200
I lied.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.967
We've been driving
20 hours straight.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.811
I thought with us making up
on the Skype and all

49:52.920 --> 49:54.001
and Gabi's engagement,

49:54.080 --> 49:57.766
what a great
Mother's Day surprise,

49:57.880 --> 49:59.450
a couple of days early.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.681
Mom, Dad!

50:00.760 --> 50:02.967
What are you guys doing here?

50:03.360 --> 50:04.361
Yay!

50:05.160 --> 50:06.605
Oh!

50:07.880 --> 50:08.880
Hi, Daddy.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.365
Hi, sweetheart.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.761
Hey, listen. Uh, where's
the little ladies' room?

50:12.880 --> 50:14.530
- Down the hall.
- I'll be right back.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.090
I just can't take him anywhere.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.770
Oh...
Oh!

50:17.840 --> 50:21.367
Well, I'll say,
this is some kind of casa.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.205
Thank you.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.044
That's not good.
It's not good.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.976
You need to call Russell.
Text Russell right now.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.047
Okay-

50:28.120 --> 50:29.136
Text Russell, tell him
don't leave the garage

50:29.160 --> 50:30.576
and don't let the kids
get out of the garage.

50:30.600 --> 50:31.647
Just stay in the garage.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.962
Oh, look at that picture.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.127
I don't like it.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.805
I don't live here.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.761
Uh... Oh, hello there,
I'm Gabi's mom.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.604
You must be Steven.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.601
Oh!

50:47.120 --> 50:48.201
I'm sorry.

50:48.280 --> 50:51.602
I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

50:51.680 --> 50:53.011
You're Gabi's mom?

50:53.120 --> 50:54.531
Yes, and who are you?
Oh.

50:54.640 --> 50:55.641
Um, I'm...

50:56.600 --> 51:01.242
I'm Max, I'm Gabi's partner.

51:01.320 --> 51:05.166
In crime. This is her
partner in crime, Max.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.484
Well, good as new.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.561
Oh.

51:10.640 --> 51:11.801
You got any beer?

51:12.160 --> 51:13.207
Yes.

51:13.320 --> 51:14.890
We could always
go out for a beer.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.480
Uh, uh...

51:16.600 --> 51:18.364
Hoegaarden, Stella...

51:18.960 --> 51:20.405
No.
Kingfisher...

51:20.480 --> 51:24.166
It sounds like
the freakin' United Nations.

51:24.720 --> 51:28.964
Uh, no, no, I'll import
some American brew from my RV.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.166
Be right back.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.480
Where is Steven?

51:32.840 --> 51:33.887
Oh.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.411
Good luck.
Steven is...

51:35.520 --> 51:36.520
Steven.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.607
The one that...

51:37.680 --> 51:38.727
Gabi's fiancé.

51:38.800 --> 51:41.041
I'm excited to meet
my future son-in-law.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.611
Are you? Okay.

51:42.680 --> 51:45.809
Mom, um, there is no Steven.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.882
Max is my partner.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.210
Your business partner?

51:52.360 --> 51:54.886
No, um, my life partner.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.450
Your li...

51:57.880 --> 51:59.120
Uh, what...

51:59.200 --> 52:01.043
I'm Gabi's wife.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.361
Huh?

52:02.520 --> 52:04.682
We're wives.

52:05.400 --> 52:07.562
No! No!

52:08.880 --> 52:10.166
What did I miss?
Oh!

52:10.920 --> 52:12.800
A heck of an episode
of The Jerry Springer <i>Show.</i>

52:12.840 --> 52:14.524
Doesn't get any
better than Jerry.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.570
Hey, Jesse, why am I
staying in the... Oh, hello.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.280
And we are back from commercial.
Go back.

52:20.600 --> 52:21.726
Are you the houseboy?

52:22.880 --> 52:24.644
No, who the hell are you?

52:24.720 --> 52:26.165
Well, I'm Jesse's father.

52:26.240 --> 52:27.360
Okay, that's not funny, pal,

52:27.400 --> 52:29.846
because Jesse's
father and mother

52:29.920 --> 52:32.400
are in a dementia
facility in Arizona, right?

52:32.920 --> 52:35.366
Dementia, my butt.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.251
We live in Texas.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.920
You're going to tell me
that you're Jesse's mother?

52:40.240 --> 52:41.287
Oh, yeah.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.607
Well, who in
the Sam H. are you?

52:43.760 --> 52:46.604
Well, lam Jesse's husband,
I think.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.400
Are we on The Jerry Springer
Show right now?

52:49.560 --> 52:51.164
Are we?
Wait, wait, wait.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.685
Jesse's not married.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.444
Oh, oh, yes, she is.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.085
Yes, she is, to me.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.247
To him.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.730
Oh, holy hell.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.927
You've got a towel-head
for a husband?

53:03.040 --> 53:04.849
Ithoughtyou broke up with him.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.367
Okay, FYI, towel-head,
super offensive. So...

53:08.440 --> 53:09.930
It's very offensive.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.285
You got married and
you didn't tell us?

53:13.400 --> 53:15.767
So is Gabi and to a gay person.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.480
What?
Mom, I'm a gay person.

53:18.560 --> 53:19.891
She is a gay person.

53:19.960 --> 53:21.849
Sweetjumpin' Jesus.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.360
Let's go, Flo.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.204
There's a whole lot
of life going on here

53:25.280 --> 53:27.009
that has nothing to do with us.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.168
This isn't the surprise
I was looking for.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.010
You'll be fine and so will he.

53:31.320 --> 53:32.526
Oh, thanks, Mom.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.768
Just get a divorce
before he gets you pregnant.

53:34.840 --> 53:35.921
Amen.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.650
Tanner needs you, Uncle Russell.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.487
Hey, buddy, come here.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.844
Who are they?

53:44.920 --> 53:47.002
Uh, this is ours. Hi.

53:47.160 --> 53:48.161
Tannen

53:48.840 --> 53:49.966
Can you say hi?

53:50.600 --> 53:52.090
Say hi, Grandma, hi, Grandpa.

53:52.160 --> 53:53.161
Yes.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.362
And, uh, Charlie is my child.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.805
That I adopted.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.962
I came from a sperm donor.
That's right.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.849
He might have been named Steven.
Mmm-hmm.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.729
Those were your grandparents.
Mmm-hmm?

54:05.000 --> 54:07.287
And I put on a bra for this?

54:12.040 --> 54:13.041
Oh.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.328
Look, it's black.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.768
Oh! Now,
that's the last straw.

54:19.840 --> 54:20.887
What?

54:20.960 --> 54:22.041
The tire, it's flat.
Oh.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.684
Don't worry, Fluffy.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.290
We'll get it fixed tomorrow.

54:26.840 --> 54:28.365
The tire, maybe.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.126
You don't need this.

54:30.200 --> 54:34.569
Look, you told me that your parents
were mentally incapacitated.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.205
Trust me, they are.

54:36.280 --> 54:39.523
Oh? They are, and besides,
it was our first date.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.162
Okay, who doesn't lie
on their first date?

54:42.240 --> 54:45.323
Oh, really? Well, what about
our second date and 50th date

54:45.400 --> 54:47.243
and what about the, um...

54:47.320 --> 54:50.130
Hey! Oh! The time that we
had a child together?

54:50.200 --> 54:53.647
Do you realize that you lied
to me about your parents?

54:53.720 --> 54:55.802
I lie to everybody
about my parents.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.120
Oh, that's reassuring.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.441
I lie about my horrible
life in that trailer park.

54:59.560 --> 55:02.404
I was a freshman in high school,
saving every dime that I had

55:02.520 --> 55:04.522
so that I could
just get out of there.

55:04.600 --> 55:07.331
No graduation,
cap, gown, on a bus.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.721
Good, I get it,
you hate your parents.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.131
No, I don't hate them.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.840
They're my parents,
so I love them, but...

55:13.880 --> 55:15.325
Honey, it's not...

55:15.400 --> 55:17.767
It's just that they're
wrong about so much

55:17.880 --> 55:20.281
and they're wrong
about how they treat people,

55:20.400 --> 55:22.576
they're wrong about how they
honor people's differences...

55:22.600 --> 55:24.045
You know what's the worst part,

55:24.120 --> 55:25.929
is that you lied
to them about me.

55:26.080 --> 55:29.209
Why? Because it's so
terrible to be married to a towel-head!

55:30.400 --> 55:32.004
How embarrassing for you.

55:32.080 --> 55:34.082
Yeah, they should have
called me Dr. Towel-Head.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.161
Where are you going?

55:37.400 --> 55:38.401
Ready?

55:40.080 --> 55:41.445
Good.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.647
Okay-

55:45.760 --> 55:46.921
Good!

55:47.000 --> 55:48.047
How'd I do?

55:48.120 --> 55:50.282
Amazing. You were so good.
Yeah. Yeah.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.521
It was really...
Help?

55:51.600 --> 55:53.170
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

55:53.280 --> 55:55.009
Um, I think
I'm going to go to yoga.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.121
Yeah, yeah, please.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.248
No, yeah,
a little safer, I guess.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.442
Hey, look,
I need your guys' help.

56:02.560 --> 56:03.561
Oh!

56:03.880 --> 56:05.609
Yeah, we've got
the perfect girl for you.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.045
No, no, no, not that.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.770
Look, um,
I want to know everything

56:08.840 --> 56:10.444
you guys know
about this Tommy kid.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.961
I like his mother, Denise.
I know!

56:13.040 --> 56:14.929
She's always
volunteering for school.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.240
That's nice.

56:16.320 --> 56:18.448
Her banana bread is nothing
to write home about.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.721
It's dry on a good day.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.371
Okay, I don't need you talking
trash about her bake sale goods.

56:22.480 --> 56:25.211
Look, I want to know,
should I let her date him?

56:25.280 --> 56:26.725
Do you have a choice?

56:27.120 --> 56:28.281
Where's the yoga class?

56:28.360 --> 56:30.124
It's right over there.
It starts at 10:00.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.686
Sorry.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.801
Where's he going?

56:41.160 --> 56:42.810
Hey, what are you
doing back there?

56:43.120 --> 56:44.963
Uh... Just checking your form.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.121
It's good. Nice job.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.201
Buns of steel, right?

56:47.640 --> 56:50.803
No, no, no. Yeah, I have a choice, okay?
I'm her father.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.247
Hmm. If you say no,
they start rebelling,

56:53.320 --> 56:55.288
start telling lies
and keeping secrets.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.124
Sneaking out, running away.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.807
Yeah, it could lead to meth, prostitution
and possibly dating a drummer.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.570
Okay, look, that's not
helpful right now.

57:02.680 --> 57:05.763
I want to know one thing, is he
a nice boy or not a nice boy?

57:05.840 --> 57:08.161
That's it.
All redheads are nice.

57:08.880 --> 57:10.564
I think he's a nice boy.
Yeah.

57:11.440 --> 57:12.771
He's all right.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.365
So, what about Mother's Day?

57:15.720 --> 57:17.131
Uh, I'll be back.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.047
Sleep tight, Katie.

57:20.720 --> 57:24.042
All right,
finally got her down to sleep

57:24.120 --> 57:26.361
just in time for
you to take her home.

57:28.120 --> 57:31.886
Hello, I'm sensing
some disappointment.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.927
I would have heard back
from the club by now.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.889
I don't get it.
I thought I killed.

57:36.960 --> 57:40.282
I'm sure you murdered,
destroyed, annihilated.

57:40.760 --> 57:43.491
I must have been better
than the girl with the banjo.

57:43.560 --> 57:47.406
Hey, you are the most
talented comic in this town.

57:49.560 --> 57:51.483
We open in 10 minutes, people.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.722
Sh... What are you, Shorty?

57:53.800 --> 57:56.041
No, I'm just yelling for two.
Ah.

57:56.960 --> 57:58.121
Oh, oh...

57:58.200 --> 58:01.443
Um, Zack, is there any way that
you can watch Katie tomorrow?

58:01.560 --> 58:03.927
I told Val that I'd take her
to a doctor's appointment.

58:04.080 --> 58:07.926
You're taking me to
my doctor's appointment. Yup.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.889
A llama? I would love... Yes.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.610
They would love that.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.210
Okay. Oh, sorry. You know what?

58:13.280 --> 58:15.931
Can I call you right back?
I have to call you right back.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.081
Thank you.

58:17.960 --> 58:21.407
Hey, Jesse! Honey, I need you to come
over Saturday morning with Tanner.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.528
Well, I'm having
a small party for the kids.

58:23.600 --> 58:25.120
Don't you think
they would like a llama

58:25.200 --> 58:26.736
way more than they'd
like the Foo Fighters?

58:26.760 --> 58:27.886
I mean, come on.

58:33.520 --> 58:37.286
Earl, I'm looking at the
girls when they were younger.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.920
<i>Loving can hurt</i>

58:41.600 --> 58:44.444
<i>Loving can hurt sometimes</i>

58:46.160 --> 58:50.802
<i>But it's the only
thing that I know</i>

58:56.240 --> 58:58.891
<i>We keep this love
in a photograph</i>

59:00.640 --> 59:03.962
<i>We made these memories
for ourselves</i>

59:04.040 --> 59:06.327
<i>Where our eyes are never closing</i>

59:06.400 --> 59:08.607
<i>Hearts are never broken</i>

59:08.680 --> 59:11.684
<i>Time's forever frozen still</i>

59:19.920 --> 59:23.811
<i>I will remember
how you kissed me</i>

59:24.160 --> 59:28.245
<i>Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street</i>

59:28.480 --> 59:31.324
<i>Hearing you whisper
through the phone</i>

59:32.800 --> 59:35.246
<i>"Wait for me to come home"</i>

59:41.400 --> 59:44.404
Hello, everybody!
Welcome to Sandy's party!

59:44.480 --> 59:45.925
All right!

59:46.000 --> 59:48.207
We've got Bella
the Balloon Lady,

59:48.280 --> 59:50.442
we've got Marty,
the animal wrangler!

59:50.520 --> 59:53.763
Hi! We've got
Pinwheel painting faces,

59:53.840 --> 59:55.922
and a big slide!

59:57.160 --> 59:58.571
Wow.
Hi.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.765
This is something.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.842
Yeah, I don't know
what happened.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.207
I just called to rent
Bella the Balloon Lady,

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.536
and I just couldn't
stop saying yes.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.800
No, no, I like it.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.365
Can we go see the llama?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.363
Yeah, why don't you go.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.771
Let me talk to Sandy.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.211
Go to the petting zoo, honey.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.486
Tortoises, bunnies...

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.005
Come on, Tanner.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.809
So, you have not heard from Russell?

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.441
Not a peep, radio silence.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.042
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.688
Well, at least you
have Tanner, you know?

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.041
He won't bite.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.169
Of course, until the day
that you get a divorce

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.811
and then you have to have
that 50/50 shared custody

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.644
and then it's just, like, hell.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.723
That's my life.
Wait a second.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.240
That's not your life,
that's my life.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.884
Indians don't
really get divorced.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.610
Tire's good.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.085
I'm all packed.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.487
Now, we can put a whole lot of
gone between us and these, uh...

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.925
<i>These, uh...</i>

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.487
Oh!

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.050
Hot damn!

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.804
What is it, Earl?

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.083
Someone stole my ignition fuse!

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.402
What are we going to do now?

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.963
There's a Pep Boys
about a mile back.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.208
I'm going to start walking.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.968
Yeah!

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.491
Can I ride the llama?

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.489
No.
How about the alpaca?

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.647
It's a fun party.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.336
Can you open this, Sam?
Yeah, we can't open...

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.249
Sure.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.401
Yeah, hey, how are you doing?

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.927
Hey, I'm doing good.
You like some spaghetti?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.047
I'm good, thanks.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.249
You don't like any spaghetti.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.691
Back up, Bozo.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.649
Oh.
The fireworks arrived.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.961
So, I'm going to
go check on Tanner.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.641
Sandy, what's going on?
Yeah. Hey.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.170
Oh, lso...

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.720
I'm so sorry. I completely
lost track of time.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.325
I'm supposed to
drop the boys off.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.244
I'm so sorry.
What is all this?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.968
It's a party.
For what?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.802
For fun, on a Saturday...
For fun on a Saturday,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.976
a party for fun on a Saturday.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.729
This is completely unlike you.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.336
What do you mean?
It feels totally like me.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.930
This is completely
irresponsible.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.526
Irresponsible?
I'm irresponsible?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.280
You can call me a lot of things,

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.800
but irresponsible
is not one of them.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.176
Listen to me,
when was the last time

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.565
you took the kids to a dentist?

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.087
Huh?

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.043
Or to go buy them,
you know, school supplies

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.204
or one of the gazillion
things that I do?

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.282
Oh, that's right.
Never

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.364
You have a parental
and legal responsibility

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.284
to drop the kids off
at the designated time.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.646
Today is Saturday.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.529
We have them at noon.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.724
You have them tomorrow
on Mother's Day.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.920
Let's go, Mikey, time to go.
Do we have to?

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.042
Yes, now, we do. Where's your brother?

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.088
He's on the slide.
Go get your stuff.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.562
Peter. Let's go.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.801
Get down here right now.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.121
No way, I'm not leaving.
Mom said we can have fun.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.176
I don't care what your mom said.
I'm in charge now.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.936
I'm going to count to three
and then I'm coming up there,

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.564
one, two, three.
Here I come.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.721
I'm coming up.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.162
Hey. Come on,
Peter. Peter!

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.480
Got to catch me first.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.407
Go get your stuff!

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.366
Hey, get your stuff.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.056
Oh, sweetie, I wouldn't touch
that if I were... That“

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.491
But I like orange.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.766
Damn it, Peter.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.921
Hey, we've got to go.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.890
Oh, well, in that case,
sure, you know, go ahead.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.091
What the...

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.241
Yo!

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.406
HENRY; Hello!

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.642
Hey! This thing is... God.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.936
Welcome to the book
signing, everyone.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.008
We're here because there's
so few book stores left,

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.320
but there will always be books.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.285
Thank you very much.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.761
Who shall I make it out to?

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.370
Rory Schroeder.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.601
Rory.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.047
Every piece ofjewelry I own
is from your collection.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.043
I love them, and so does Jerald.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.770
But they look better on me.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.971
Who shall I make it out to?

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.121
Your daughter.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.322
So, tell me, why now?

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.242
Well, I just thought
because she was in Atlanta,

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.527
it would be a good time.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.641
I see.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.176
You know, you're the fourth person
to say they're her daughter.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.488
Of course, after <i>Forbes
</i> listed Miranda as the top 50

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.609
female entrepreneurs in this
country, how convenient.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.001
I have this.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.643
Anybody could have forged
this and even if it's real,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.370
you're not going to get
a dime out of her.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.247
Okay, this was
a mistake. I...

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.096
Could you please
just let her know

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.964
that I never wanted
anything from her?

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.489
Well, that was historic.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.370
That was a historic disaster.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.401
Oh...

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.760
I mean, this is all so stupid.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.484
This is so stupid.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.528
Look at all this.
What am I doing?

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.204
I mean, you know...

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.323
Ugh, I feel like such an idiot.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.404
So, what I'm basically doing
is I'm trying to compete

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.564
with my ex-husband
and a 20-year-old.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.564
Thatjust makes a lot
of sense, right, Jess?

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.845
It's stupid.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.410
You know what it is?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.884
I just... I just hate
feeling so replaceable.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.006
Well, sadly we all are.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.600
Oh, geez, you scared
the crap out of me.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.366
I mean, we're all replaceable.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.410
For every professional clown, there's
100 hacks with a red nose and a wig

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.481
waiting to do the job.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.322
Yeah, I understand.
Thanks, clown.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.721
Jesse?

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.366
There's no way that the bond
you have with your kids

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.930
can ever be broken.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.296
I mean, there's
no contest, right?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.368
You're their mom.
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.607
Oh, let me help.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.681
Oh...

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.087
Thank... Okay.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.000
Yeah? See?

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.084
It's this, I get it,
never-ending scarf bit.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.096
Yeah, it's the first time you
got to use this one today, huh?

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.531
Ah...

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.523
Got a smile from you.
That's great.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.204
Do you mind if I rub...

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.691
Please.
Thank you very much.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.416
It's always the traditional
things that work,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.169
the bottomless sleeve hanky,

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.208
the bottomless cup of coffee,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.601
the bottomless love
from a mother to her kids.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.047
They know it's there. Sometimes
they just take it for granted.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.521
Yeah.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.931
So what if the other girl is 20,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.287
has great skin and probably
looks insane in a bikini?

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.927
Okay, that's good, I get it.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.080
Nice pep talk there, clown.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.726
Thank you, clown.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.247
Never thought I'd ever hear myself
say that, but thank you, clown.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.606
My pleasure.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.121
Mmm.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.641
A heart-to-heart with a clown.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.642
There was not
a soul to see that.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.326
He could have murdered me.
Okay.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.086
Jesse, you home?

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.163
Hey, I'm getting a beer!

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.322
<i>Hello. Who are you?</i>

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.365
Well, who are you?

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.562
<i>Sonia, mother of Russell.</i>

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.847
Yeah, well, I'm Florence,
mother of Jesse.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.364
<i>Florence, nice to meet you!</i>

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.649
<i>Ugh, I heard about your
surprise drop-in.</i>

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.245
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:22.685
I think so.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.680
I'm not real sure.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.761
<i>Are you having a beer?</i>

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.361
Yeah.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.881
<i>I think I'll join you.</i>

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.126
<i>To say the truth,</i>

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.720
<i>when Russell told me he was
in love with a white girl,</i>

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.291
<i>I wanted to punch a wall.</i>

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:41.044
Well, at least
you knew about it.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.286
<i>And then they eloped</i>

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.095
<i>and they didn't even
invite me to the wedding.</i>

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.406
<i>They didn't even tell me.</i>

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.410
Yeah, well, I'm double spitting
just thinking about it.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.091
Thought I was finished
with them,

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.399
but they're my baby girls.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.522
<i>But, Florence, have you
seen our grandchild?</i> Oh...

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.121
I get why they call him Tanner.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.844
He's a little dark.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.483
<i>I think he's a little light.</i>

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.484
Hey, what time is it in India?

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.323
<i>India? Who knows.</i>

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:13.243
<i>I live here in Las Vegas.</i>

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:17.529
<i>No taxes, and I play
the slots anytime I want.</i>

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.484
Hey, smart move.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.642
Plus, you can drive 20
miles in any direction

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.081
and find some sand
when you get homesick, right?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.721
<i>I don't get that joke, but
it sounds racist, and funny.</i>

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.046
Hi, Grandma!

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.725
Hey-

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.760
Could you watch Tanner a minute?
I have to go pee.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.004
Thank you.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.285
Here we go!

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.327
I think you look
a little like me.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.681
Uh-huh.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.370
Yes, you do.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.209
I think you do.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.250
You look just like
me in the summertime.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.296
Lakens, thank you
so much for coming.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.651
We'll see you next time.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.163
Well, everything
looks good here.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.766
Will you be joining us for
tomorrow's Mother's Day brunch?

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.365
No, I'm working.
Oh...

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.766
Are you a mom?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.447
No.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.642
I don't suppose you'd like
a complimentary mum for Mum's Day?

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.401
No.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.768
If you need anything, just ask.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.685
I'm sorry to interrupt
your dinner, my dear.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.443
Fried green tomatoes.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.322
Lance, you're my agent and I
love you, which is an oxymoron,

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.643
but if you are here for
some philosophical chat,

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.166
short, short would be good here.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.685
Yes, you know me as Lance
Wallace, agent to the stars.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.370
You used to have big stars.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.487
Now you just have me.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.281
Mmm.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.205
But you really know
I was born in the Bronx

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.681
and my name was Ramone Navarro,

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.728
who collected empty soda
bottles to get money to eat.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.721
We are who the world thinks we
are and sometimes, we're not.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.447
We decide who we are,

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.524
when we want and
who we want to know.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.125
Or is it whom?

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.731
<i>Are you done, Ramona'?</i>

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.491
Just doing my job, to make sure

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.643
that nothing lowers
the kilowatts on that smile.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.601
Hmm.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.729
Oh, you're right, you're
right, that is the salad fork.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.284
Hey, change of plan.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.521
I got the call.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.736
One of the girls
had to pull out.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.240
She got a comedy series for NBC.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.930
It'll probably be
canceled, but anyway,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.490
I'm in the final tonight.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.641
Where are you?

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.085
I've got Katie.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.281
She's fine.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.001
Bye.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.485
<i>Good stuff.
Okay, next up.</i>

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.127
Good night.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.761
Oh...

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.883
I shouldn't be watching this.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.161
Good night.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.125
Good night.
Yeah, yeah, good night.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.291
Good night.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.761
I'm home.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.205
Well, how...

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.086
Good night.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.603
You used to say good night.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.484
It'd take you hours
to say good night, actually.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.527
Hey, honey, where are you?

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.090
I'm getting worried.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.444
If you're thinking
of splitting, please don't.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.522
Let's just keep loving
each other and Katie.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.845
I don't want to marry you.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.447
<i>I mean, I do want to marry you,</i>

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.682
<i>but we don't
have to get married.</i>

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.967
<i>If you get this,
please come to the club.</i>

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.371
<i>I love you.</i>

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.601
<i>This competition
is worth $5,000.</i>

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.809
Zack Zim, you're in
the finals, by default.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.848
Good for you.
Aw...

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.249
That is the most adorable
baby I've ever seen.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.240
Would you be able to watch
her while I do my set?

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.520
No.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.366
<i>Welcome to the stage, Zack Zim.</i>

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.962
Zack Zim, he's very... Oh, that's you.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.644
All right, go on out there, kid.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.720
Come on, I'm rooting for you.
I'll be out in front.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.569
<i>Uh...</i>

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.801
Hello.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.681
Um...

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.330
<i>So, I'm Zack.</i>

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.568
<i>Uh, this is Katie.</i>

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.050
Say hi.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.324
<i>She's a bit shy.</i>

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.727
<i>I'll just say this from the
get-go, this wasn't planned.</i>

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.330
<i>Coming out here with
her wasn't planned,</i>

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.402
<i>not she wasn't planned,</i>

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.251
<i>although to be fair, you were
a little bit of a surprise.</i>

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:04.407
<i>Didn't like that joke.</i>

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.921
<i>Uh...</i>

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.005
<i>So, does anyone in
here have a baby?</i>

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.523
<i>No, obviously you don't.</i>

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.443
<i>You're here having a life.</i>

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.287
<i>No, don't cry, stop crying.</i>

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.125
<i>Five grand at stake.</i>

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.289
<i>Mate, would you mind
holding her for a sec?</i>

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.601
<i>What's your name, pal?</i>

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.681
Tiny.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.016
<i>Tiny, if you don't
mind me saying,</i>

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.281
<i>you look like you have
a very welcoming bosom.</i>

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.890
<i>May I rest my child on it?</i>

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.007
Sure.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.120
<i>Just for a sec, thank you.</i>

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:00.046
<i>I mean, I don't know whether to be
pleased or just deeply offended.</i>

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.643
<i>How did you do that?</i>

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.882
I'm soft, like a couch.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.167
<i>Please, will you
come and live with us?</i>

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.321
<i>I'm deadly serious.</i>

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.647
<i>I haven't slept in a year.</i>

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.801
<i>I'll take the couch.</i>

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.490
<i>My girlfriend's very attractive.</i>

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.483
Can your girlfriend
take the couch?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.570
<i>Oh, my girlfriend, yes.</i>

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.971
That's my sister.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.242
<i>Hey, can everyone please give it
up for the world's biggest nanny?</i>

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.249
<i>Well</i> done.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.084
Thank you.
I'll take her back.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.841
Bye.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.161
Thank you.
Call me.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.291
Whoa.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.730
<i>You know, being a dad
does change you.</i>

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.723
<i>I worry all the time.</i>

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.564
<i>Do I know when she's tired?</i>

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.210
<i>Not really.</i>

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.486
<i>When she's about to be sick?</i>

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.360
<i>Definitely not.</i>

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.360
<i>This is the last
good shirt that I own.</i>

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.484
<i>But her mother knows,</i>

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.211
<i>because in every
atom of their body,</i>

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.804
<i>they know what's right for their
children and for their families.</i>

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.211
<i>Anyway, speaking of parents, I
better get this one back to hers.</i>

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.206
<i>Hey!
Thank you very much.</i>

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.402
<i>I've been Zack Zim,
and this has been Katie.</i>

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.410
Aw, what a cute baby.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.845
I love babies.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.729
We can have one if you want.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.764
It's our first date.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.968
So, what are you doing tomorrow?

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.326
Shut up.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.681
I was freaking out.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.444
I thought you bailed.
Where were you?

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.241
I'm sorry, you know, usual
stuff, meeting my real mom.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.560
Your mom, what?

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.641
Yeah, it was awful.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.760
Awful?

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.650
Just really made me appreciate
what I have. Totally.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.084
You're the best.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.161
<i>We have a unanimous winner.</i>

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.449
<i>Katie Zim.</i>

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.369
<i>Oh, and that guy
with her. Come on up.</i>

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.936
Oh, my God. Wait,
wait, wait, take her.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.440
She won, you just
held her props, really.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.896
So, wait, your actual mother?

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.127
Just go get it.
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.720
<i>Congratulations!</i>

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.280
<i>Zack Zim!</i>

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.128
<i>Yeah, we each got our babies.</i>

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.124
Happy Mother's Day!
Happy Mother's Day!

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.921
What? Oh, my God.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.971
You guys... You guys
are the cutest.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.611
The banana was my idea,
you know, to stay healthy.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.051
It's perfect.
I love it.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.690
Are those M&M pancakes?

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.649
Yeah.
Oh, boy.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.767
Open my gift.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.251
Okay, okay, okay-

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.327
Why?

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.766
That's the coolest potato man
ever, period, end of story.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.051
That's awesome.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.722
"Thanks for all that you do.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.245
"We appreciate you.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.322
"Happy Mother's Day, Tina."

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.162
You gave her the
wrong gift, you dork.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.651
Oops, sorry, Mom.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.688
Oh, that's okay.
That's okay.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.690
I love you, Mom.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.288
Thank you. I love you.
This one's for you.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.687
Okay, Okay-

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.727
This is better
than the first one.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.926
It's even better.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.561
That's sweet.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.491
I love him.
Thank you so much.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.401
This is for you.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.686
Thanks, babe.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.047
Did you get
a card for Tina, too?

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.361
Yeah, but a totally
different one.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.808
I can throw Tina's
away if you want.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.406
No.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.129
No, no, no, no,
I don't want you to do that.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.925
But you're so sad.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.126
Oh, okay, listen, here, take
this over there for a second.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.201
Get in here.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.721
Get in here.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.924
Vicky, Rachel,
where are you guys?

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.523
Come on, let's wake up,
have a little breakfast, huh?

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.167
Guys, don't make me
come up there.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.490
It's too late.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.927
Come on,
let's go, up and at 'em.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.446
Hey-

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.288
Hey, Vicky!

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.485
Rachel, where are you?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.456
Hey, Kimberly,
I can't talk right now.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.696
I don't know where my girls are.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.290
<i>The girls are with me.</i>

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.680
What are you
talking about, where?

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:46.606
I love you so much,

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.402
and, you know, it's just...
It's hard to share, you know?

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.804
Sort of like how you feel
about your LEGO pirate ship.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.201
You know how you didn't
want anyone to touch it?

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.041
Yeah, well, that's
kind of how I feel.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.689
But you remember
how good you felt

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.524
when you saw how happy Nick was

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.127
when he was able to walk
Peg Leg down the plank?

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.681
Right?

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.882
Yeah, that's because it's
really, really good to share.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.007
It's really good.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.730
In fact, as I say
this, you know what,

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.328
I think I'm going to take you over to
Daddy's a little later on today, okay?

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.768
So you can give Tina
her awesome potato man.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.124
You're really going to share?

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.651
Yeah.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:36.851
Yep, I'm going to
share, for an hour.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.604
An hour, maybe two.
I'll see how I feel.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.736
How do you feel about that?

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.171
Yeah.
Yeah?

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.296
We're gonna grab some lunch
and we'll see you at the parade.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.765
Have fun.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.001
Bye, Max.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.289
Were you summoned, too?

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.840
Yep, just wondering if I'm
going to get an opportunity

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.524
to have a last meal.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.125
Doubtful.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.204
I mean, they can't ground
us anymore, can they?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.002
You lied to your mother.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.924
Mom made me live
alone in college

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.120
'cause she didn't want me to
have a minority roommate.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.816
Yeah, and she spanked me when
I said I wanted to dress up

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.921
like a guy for Halloween.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.925
I didn't think Liberace was an
appropriate costume for a little girl.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.281
Do they know we're coming?

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.362
Yeah, I called Daddy earlier.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.607
I'll pick you up tonight,
just before dinner, okay?

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.961
Bye, Mom.
Bye, I love you.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.886
Have fun.

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.405
I'm so happy to see you.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.561
Hi, hi.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.291
What's that?

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.243
For me? Oh, my gosh.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.482
A surprise.
Thank you so much.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.891
Thank you.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.524
Happy Mother's Day.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.211
We love you.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.404
<i>Russell, it's Jesse.</i>

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.608
<i>I'm leaving to go live
with my parents for a while</i>

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:00.041
<i>and I'm taking Tanner
with me. Bye.</i>

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.329
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on!

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.810
Hey, hold on, wait,
hold on, I'm coming!

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.727
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, stop, stop, stop, stop,

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.168
stop, wait, hold on, hold on,
wait a minute, let me in,

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.725
stop, stop, stop,
hold on, hold on!

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.405
Waita minute!

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.321
Where's Tanner?

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.680
Relax, he's with
Max and Charlie.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.801
Nice robe.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.488
We just said it
to get you in here.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.571
Oh, great, another lie.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.041
Yeah, is this your
new thing now? Bye.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.640
<i>Russell, we would
like to thank you for coming.</i>

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.367
Mom? You're in on this?

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.211
<i>Maybe if you would call me more
often, you would know me better.</i>

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.483
<i>Russell, I know I make jokes
about Jesse, but I love her.</i>

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.366
<i>So, Flo and I thought you two
should kiss and make up.</i>

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.091
No, no, because she's a liar.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.970
She's a lying, lying liar, okay?

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.361
And besides, scaring
me to get me in here

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.966
is not a good way to start
a conversation, okay?

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.485
Have fun. I'm leaving.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.210
Not unless you're going to jump.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.243
Dad, what are you doing?
Slow down!

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.521
Oh, come on.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.440
Where are we going?

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.170
All right,
this is crazy, all right?

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.656
She lied about everything.
You know what?

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.365
If I was your parents, I
would have been home by now.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.240
If this sucker hadn't had all those
repairs, we would have been.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.806
Actually,
that would be my fault.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.881
H ow?

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.760
I kind of told Charlie
to mess with the engine

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.450
so Grandma and Grandpa
couldn't get home.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.921
The flat tire was
just bad luck, or good.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.451
You did that for us?

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.847
Forget that.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.526
I'm impressed that he knew
so much about engines.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.250
Yeah, he really does.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.688
Honey, please forgive me.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.491
I promise, I will never,
ever lie to you, ever again.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.244
I just... I cross my heart.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.449
You promise?
Promise.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.050
Okay, I forgive you.
You do?

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.327
No, I'm lying.
You see how that feels?

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.163
Uh, sorry to interrupt your
moment, but this ain't good.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.321
What?

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.529
The brakes are out and we're
going pretty damn fast.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.728
I swear, Charlie did not
mess with the brakes.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.564
No, no, I was
supposed to get them fixed,

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.763
but I took the money and I
spent it at the dog track!

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.801
Look out for the garbage.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.526
<i>Hey, what is happening?</i>

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.650
<i>Where did everybody go?</i>

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.127
Jesse, stay down.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.611
Stay under me!

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.570
Hey, that's Grandma's house.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.404
So it is. Let's check it out.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.091
They made a womb
float for Mother's Day?

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.891
I can't wait to see
what they do for Father's Day.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.571
Hello, Marvin, you got
a two-vehicle pursuit.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.447
One is an RV from Texas and the
other one is big and pink.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.291
Slow down!

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.361
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, we're in pursuit.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.681
Whoa!

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.603
Earl, Jesse, Gabi,
I love you! Russell?

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.681
Yeah.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.405
Nice to meet you.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.130
We're going to hit real hard.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.247
No!

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.721
Huh?

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.168
Well, uh, that wasn't
so hard, now, was it?

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.491
Everybody all right?

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.721
What the hell happened?

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.201
Nothing. I lied.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.085
The brakes were fixed.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.330
The fear of death brings
everyone closer together.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.730
Welcome, welcome to my family.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.004
Everybody out of the vehicle.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.126
Let's go.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.049
Okay, we're coming. Hi.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.440
Out of the vehicle.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.209
Get your hands up
where we can see them.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.566
You guys OKHY?

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.489
Hello, officers,
how are you doing?

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.680
Mom, just put your hands up.

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.451
Spread your legs.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.287
Anybody else?

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.370
Hi, it's just me.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.120
Get on the ground.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.725
On the ground!

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.245
Get on the ground!

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.364
On the ground!

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.966
Sir, that is my husband!

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.281
Officer, I don't
really appreciate

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.562
how you're treating
my son-in-law.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.722
Wait, it's okay,
you guys, this is my doctor.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.404
He fixed my knee.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.000
Hi, Dr. Kohli.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.561
Hey, Danielle.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.924
Finally, somebody stands up.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.321
Oh, boy, you okay, Russell?

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.640
Yeah, I'm all right.
All right.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.246
Well, I neverthought I'd have to
say this in the line of duty,

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.608
but who's got the
registration for the vagina?

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.405
We do. But we already
missed the parade.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.005
There's a parade of vaginas?

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.445
Yup, there sure was.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.164
Well, that's okay.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.607
Now we can have
a real family picnic together.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.002
Love you, too, Mom.
Happy Mother's Day.

01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.611
Did she just kiss me?

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.762
We missed the parade,
but we're gonna have a picnic!

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.649
I'm proud of you, Earl.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.969
Oh, thank you, Fluffy.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.368
Thanks for taking us, Kimberly.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.680
Oh, and for brunch, too.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.410
I bet my dad's
going to kill you.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.244
Please, I can handle him.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.084
I am a pole dancer.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.764
Bring it on!

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.287
Wow. I think your daddy used his
veteran's discount at ProFlowers.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.206
Surprise!

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.922
Dad, what is all this?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.606
Oh, this is everything they
had left at the flower shop.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:45.328
Okay, but why is it here?

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.656
I thought it was about time we
started celebrating Mother's Day.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.045
I better go find my babies.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.927
And for my first surprise, for
the youngest, Vicky, voila'.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.241
Oh.
Whoa.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.170
A karaoke machine!

01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.730
That's right, yes.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.683
Young lady, that's for you.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:12.003
But these are...
These are Mom's car keys.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.567
Yeah, I sold the car anyway,

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.688
but figured you'd want the keys.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.524
Kidding, you get the car, too.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.881
Oh, my God, thank you.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.930
You're very welcome.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.081
Thank you.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.161
Look at this place.

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.521
Mmm.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.808
Dad, did you invite him?

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:37.927
No.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.243
No, I hired him
to run the punch bowl.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.288
Okay.
Yeah.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.522
I'm going to go get some punch.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.647
All right.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.163
Hey-Hey

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.810
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.769
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.251
I am. Thank you.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.800
Hi.
Hey, neighbor.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.370
Hey.
Hi, I'm Lexy.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.646
Lexy.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.690
Nice to meet you. Nice
to meet you as well.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.160
Um, yeah, well,
please help yourself

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.771
to the punch and smell
the flowers. Go nuts.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.047
That's the sexy mom
we were telling you about.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.884
Oh, that makes sense,
okay, yeah.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:16.089
Well, that might be a little too
much for me right now, you know?

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.321
Fair enough.
Mmm-hmm.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.680
I'm going to
keep trying, though.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.404
No, please do.
That's a great start.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.481
Hey-

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.681
Wow!

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.921
Do you know what it is?

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.087
No.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.605
It's a karaoke machine.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.444
That's cool.
What's that button do?

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.488
That's an echo, so it
makes it sound like...

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:35.207
My God, you people on steroids?

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.171
Wait, hello, Tina?

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.936
<i>It's me-I really need
your help right now.</i> What?

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.976
<i>I don't</i> know <i>what</i> to do. Wait,
Tina, slow down. What's wrong?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.604
What's wrong?
It's Mikey.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.960
He can't breathe.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.883
Okay, that's his asthma.

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.136
No, I know, Henry warned me
that it's bad this time of year

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.216
and there's a lot of ragweed.

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.049
Where's his inhaler?

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.487
It's here, but it's empty
and I can't find the backup.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.561
Where's Henry?

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.483
He's at the store
and he's not answering.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.881
All right, just take him
to the freezer.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.007
<i>He's not hungry.</i>

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.121
I know he's not hungry.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.296
It's just that breathing in the
cold air really helps him,

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.367
sojust go, g0, 90, 9°-

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.096
<i>Let's go the freezer, okay?
You're going to be okay.</i>

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.124
You're going to be fine. Yeah,
just breathe this in.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.884
Okay, all right.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.849
Oh, my gosh,
Sandy, lam so scared.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.921
I know, I know.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.241
Listen, I keep a spare inhaler
in his backpack.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.691
Okay, yep. I got it.
I'll put you on speaker.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.081
Okay, where?

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:26.889
Okay. There are four pockets.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.689
It's in the one
that has the rat on it.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.246
There's no zipper on the rat.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.846
It's on the side of the rat!

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.803
<i>It's on the side
of the rat, sorry.</i>

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.728
It's all right, I got you.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.404
I got you.
Come here, buddy.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.976
Here you go.
Come on, come on. I got you.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.331
<i>I want Mommy.</i>

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.482
Okay, Mommy's coming, honey.
You're okay.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.171
<i>Daddy's going to make you feel
all better, you know that.</i>

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.411
Okay, give him three puffs
and then give him three more

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.562
in 30 minutes if he needs it, okay?

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.576
I don't like his color. I'm
going to take him to the ER.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.800
All right, then go. Just go,
go and I'll meet you there.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.886
Get his stuff.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.522
Hey, 0.1, hit it-.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.171
Here we go.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.806
<i>All right!
Stop whatcha doin'</i>

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:13.961
<i>'Cause I'm about to ruin</i>

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.929
<i>The image and the
style that ya used to</i>

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.365
<i>I look funny, right?</i>

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.965
<i>But, yo, I'm makin' money, see?</i>

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.724
<i>So, yo world I hope
you're ready for me</i>

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.406
<i>My name is Humpty
Pronounced with a "umpty"</i>

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.609
<i>Yo, moms Oh, how I

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.444

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.124
<i>Please allow me to bump thee</i>

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.726
<i>I'm steppin' tall, y'all
And just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:35.121
<i>You're gonna fall
when the stereos pump me</i>

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.123
<i>I'm still rockin'
these pink pants</i>

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.804
<i>And I even got my own dance</i>

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.804
<i>The Humpty Dance is your
chance to do the hump</i>

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.291
<i>That's right, folks,
help me out.</i>

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.968
<i>- Do me, baby!
- Do the Humpty hump</i>

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.044

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.961
<i>ALL". Do the Humpty hump</i>

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.203

<i>ALL". Do the Humpty hump</i>

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.521
Watch me...

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.164
Where'd he g0?

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.441
Dad!

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.846
Are you okay, Dad?

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.081
Yeah, I'm okay, Vicky.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.770
Rachel, how does my leg look?

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.887
Great, Dad.

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.007
What about my right leg?

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.451
Someone call 911.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.443
See what happens when
you let white boys rap?

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.766
<i>There you go, folks.</i>

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.006
<i>Happy Mother's Day.</i>

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.962
Don't move, Dad.
I'm coming down.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.563
Rach, it might be time to
practice driving to the hospital.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.447
Got it.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.644
Ihopeifs okay that I'm here.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.531
I knew it was you
the moment I saw you.

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.926
We were 16 and in love.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.366
What, puppy love?

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.649
No, true love, epic,

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.964
"plan your whole life
around it" kind of love,

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.610
and then there was you.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.644
His family moved to another city
the day we gave them the news

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.645
and my parents pulled me
out of school for a year.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.684
My mother never really
looked at me the same again.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.962
Forever disappointed, I think.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.651
It was never
even a consideration

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.096
if I would get to
keep you, actually.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.806
She said she found a nice
family that lived in Hawaii.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.890
They weren't nice.
They were wonderful.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.644
I know they've passed.
I'm sorry.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.324
My parents are gone, too.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.802
It's just you and me.

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.808
Part of the deal
was that they would

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.680
send me a picture
of you every year

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:55.530
so that I could
just see that you were okay.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.569
Wow. What?

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.130
I don't understand.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.045
Why didn't you ever contact me?

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.530
That was the other
part of the deal.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:38.046
So, I lost my true love and you,

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.522
and I didn't want
to replace that,

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:47.528
so I went for a
career and that is what I have.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.081
What is that?

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.724
That's your granddaughter.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.770
That's my boyfriend, Zack.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.930
Katie, I want you to
meet someone special.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.604
This is Katie.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:11.890
Katie, do you
want to meet someone?

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.321
Yes.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.251
That's your grandma.

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.161
Hello.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.290
Hey, how is he?
He's good.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.120
He's back to his normal self.
Oh, thank God.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.176
They're supposed to be bringing him out.
I'm going to go check.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.089
Thank God. Oh, good.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.361
Hi.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.570
Hi. You okay?
Hi.

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.971
Yes.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:55.010
Sandy, I am so sorry.
Yeah.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.456
I don't know what
happened to his inhaler.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:58.005
That's why we have a backup.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.043
Your middle name is now backup.

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.726
Okay. I just...
I really panicked.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.801
I know.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.211
How do you stay so calm?

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.763
Well, Tina, it just takes time.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.002
It's time.
I mean, Peter's...

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.570
Thirteen.
How old?

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.641
How old are you?
Thirteen.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.166
Thirteen. It takes
13 years, you know?

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:18.969
So, just give yourself a break.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.128
Otherwise, you're going
to really wear yourself down

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.884
and it's going to piss me off.

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.769
Make that one of your rules.
That's good.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.527
Whose child is this?

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.045
Mommy!

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.805
On, baby, m.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.486
Mommy, can I have some
candy, please? Oh...

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.762
Sly move.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.729
I told you you'd be okay.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.885
All right, I'm going to get you some
candy and maybe one for myself.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.291
Hold this, please.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.250
<i>Now, since it's Mother's Day
and I am a mother,</i>

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.246
<i>I'd like to introduce a very special
guest, my daughter, Kristin.</i>

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.168
<i>She has something very special
she would like to say.</i>

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.529
<i>Father of my child,
light of my life,</i>

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.010
<i>Zack, will you marry me?</i>

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.765
<i>And because I made
you wait so long,</i>

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.049
<i>I'd like to do it today,
while my mother's still here.</i>

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.721
Well, will you?

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.881
Wha...

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.361
Uh...

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.930
The show's pre-taped.

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.965
Will you?

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.002
Well, you know,

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.401
I'm going to have
to think it over.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:50.961
Hmm.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.889
Okay, <i>I</i> did.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.644
Yes.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.285
I love you.
I love you, too.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.161
Oh...

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.524
Oh, I think it's time.

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.611
Gotta go.
Oh...

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.967
Where's my purse?
Where are the keys?

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.451
Good luck, you guys.

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.410
Time for a wedding.
Where's Shorty? Shorty?

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.720
Me.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.450
You're Shorty?
Yeah.

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.601
Should have guessed.

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.728
Okay, listen,
Miranda wants to throw

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.280
a big expensive wedding
at the best hotel,

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.089
but Kristin wants
to get married here

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.456
becausethafs
where they first met.

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.051
Great, and we'll do our best
to make it expensive.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.167
Well, thank you for that.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.576
Who's going to
perform the ceremony?

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.647
I'm officiating.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.046
You got a license?

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.361
Of course, from
the online church of Idaho.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.771
Can we do this now?

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.283
Wow. We're gonna make a buck.

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.450
<i>Paging
Dr. Freeman and Dr. Sheehan.</i>

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.444
<i>Please report to
the nurse's station.</i>

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.131
Come on.

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.649
Are you kidding me?

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.008
This is what's going
to happen today?

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.444
All right, okay.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.200
God!
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.281
Oh, God.

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.161
Whoa.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.010
You know what?
Guys, let's go this way.

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.242
Let's not get involved. Come
on, here we go.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.441
Oh...

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.170
Hey, tampon man.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.766
Right?
Remember at the...

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.205
Hey.
Hi.

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.891
Hi there.
Um...

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.610
We were...
Yes.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.045
Yeah, of course, hi.

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.810
It's actually Bradley.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.206
Oh, Bradley.
Yeah.

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.496
These are my daughters. This
is Rachel, and this is Vicky.

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.521
Hi.
Hi.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.806
This is...
Sandy.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.082
With two sons.
Yes, that's right.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.128
Um...

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.685
You all right? You know what?
No.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.121
I'm kind of in
a little bit of a situation.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.520
Okay. I got you.
It's so silly.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.051
Girls, do me a favor,

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.256
why don't you run
and go find and see

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.520
if someone has a key for this?

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.802
There's, like, a security
guard up front I'm sure.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.362
It probably looks
kind of suspicious.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.605
Are you wondering how I got into

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.091
this predicament?
Mmm.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.201
No, I'm not really.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.296
You see what happens every time...
Uh-huh.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.016
I try to get up?
It's caught on something.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.376
It's not coming down
any further, all right,

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.050
well, let me see
what I can do there.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.776
Pull your wrist over this way.
Ow! Careful.

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:27.801
What?

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.087
It's a Miranda Collins bracelet,
just, you know. Oh...

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.363
What did you do to your leg?

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.051
Another hip-hop-related
casualty is all.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.566
Hip hop?
Yeah. What about you?

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.880
Why are you here?
Are you in

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.331
the psychiatric wing?

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.123
No. My son had
an asthma attack.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.881
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Is he okay?

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.567
Yeah, he's all back to normal,
so I'm getting him this candy.

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.766
I got you, we'll get it.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.001
Oh, bend it, bend it.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.256
Here, I'm going to
pull it down. There.

01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.361
Ow...

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.851
Whoa. Awesome.
Ta-da.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.206
Wait.
You're free.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.367
Get that thing down here.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.090
This thing?
Get that Skittle.

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.685
That's why I did it
in the first place.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.285
Don't. This is
what's going to happen.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.044
Hey, all right.
Yeah.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.611
That's amazing.
Nicely done.

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.761
Get it.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.202
Wait. Oh, you know what,
while we're in here...

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.165
Okay, but if anybody catches us,

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.080
we'll say you're stealing
candy for sick kids.

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.690
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.326
I owe you one.

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:27.805
No, random act of kindness.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.001
Well, thank you.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.610
Do you need a ride?

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.211
No, we have a car.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.209
Yeah. Of course, of course.
Yeah.

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:35.566
And l...

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.210
What am I thinking?
I've got my kids,

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.482
my ex-husband, his new wife.
Oh...

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:40.960
It's a carful.
Wow.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.122
Yeah, I'm divorced, too.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.121
Oh, um...

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.968
Actually, my wife
passed away, so...

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.321
Oh...

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.287
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.562
Oh, that must make today so hard.
It's okay.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.768
It's starting to be okay.

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.281
Thank you.

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.016
Dad, we looked everywhere.
We couldn't...

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.326
No, no, no.
We're good, actually.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.845
- She's free.
- Free.

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.809
Emancipated. Yeah.
We're good. Yup.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.164
Yeah. Um...
So...

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.809
Well, hey, I will see
you around, I guess.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.320
That would be nice.

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.800
Wait, my dad owns a fitness gym.

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.120
Give her your card.
You should totally stop by,

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.044
you know, try a yoga class
or pole dancing even. Mmm.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.010
It helps you get in
touch with your body.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.005
Mmm-hmm.
I've heard.

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:32.606
It is?

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.171
I go to this gym-

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.281
What?

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.169
I just signed up,
like, a couple weeks ago.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.691
How have I not seen you?

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.881
I've never seen you there.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.536
I know, how have I
never seen you there?

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.130
That's weird.
That's so weird.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.684
All right, well, great, so maybe
I'll see you there sometime.

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:49.849
Thanks.
Yeah, thank you.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.362
- Go here.
- Like that? No, this?

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.521
Go up.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.283
Oh, no, that's terrible.
I love it.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.121
All right.
Let's eat, guys.

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.287
Let's eat, Mom.

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.210
Mom!
Whoa!

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:04.656
Mom, you didn't tell
me you were coming.

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.045
Surprise. Oh.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.890
I didn't know you were coming.

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.962
<i>Beta,</i> I need money to
tip the Ubber driver.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.321
Okay, it's Uber.

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.206
I came to see you.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.487
How did you know
we were even here?

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.686
I'm a mother.
Mmm...

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.491
Flo, it's so good to see you.
Oh, my goodness.

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.766
We did it.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.521
Okay-

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.366
Oh. Oh!

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:29.169
Wow! You look
really nice.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.124
Are you ready?

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.884
I am ready.

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:38.051
Oh, but, um, I think I'll
need someone to hold Katie.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.365
It would be my honor.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.924
Okay, you ready?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.081
Come to Grandma.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:51.522
Oh.
Ooh, sticky.

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.886
They're always sticky.
Ugh.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.325
I mean...

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.045
Okay.

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.770
All right, there we go.

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.201
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.725
A little higher.
Don't drop her.

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.404
Little bit higher. Yup, perfect.
Got it.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.528
- Got it.
- Okay.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.125
Should we start without you?

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.851
Oh, no, we're good to go.
Thanks, Dominic.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.803
Okay.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.408
All right, let's go.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.122
Ma, how long are you staying?

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.966
We'll see.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.168
Earl and I may stay awhile, too.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.571
They have a big house.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.848
Sorry that took so long.
Here, honey.

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.367
Just let me finish these release
papers and you'll be on your way.

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.564
Thanks, you've
been very helpful.

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.766
Well, that was one of our
more eventful Mother's Days.

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:46.526
I mean, to be honest, I really
prefer the really boring, sweet,

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.171
burnt pancakes in bed,
you know what I mean?

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.251
I'm sorry about yesterday.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.810
That party was really stupid.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.296
I can't believe you had a llama.

01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:58.496
I can't believe I had a llama.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:46:59.681
And an alpaca.

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.680
Hey, kids, what do you
say we go to IHOP for dinner?

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.080
Yeah!
Breakfast for dinner.

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.321
Yeah.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.296
Your mom and I just have to
wait for this paperwork.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.810
We'll be a few minutes.

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.042
Yeah, we'll just
wait in the car.

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:13.849
Okay, come on, boys.
Come on.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.726
Hey, Sandy.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.882
Hey, Sandy with two sons!

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.004
So, who's Captain Pink Pants?

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.767
Oh!

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.445
Uh, first of all,
they're salmon.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.688
Oh, is that what those were?
And they're cute.

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.011
Anyone I should know about?

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.090
Oh, trust me, I'll shock you
when it's permanent.

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.722
Yeah, and does he know how
you hate beards? Oh...

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:58.089
You know what, I think it's
actually quite sexy on him.

01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.281
Oh...

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.320
And we're back to normal.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.561
Yeah.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.001
Uh-oh.
- Whoo!

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.169
This is just how I pictured it.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.809
Can we vow this up, please?

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.882
We got people
waiting for tables.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.161
Oh...

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.721
on.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.561
All right.

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:53.169
We are gathered here
to unite these two souls.

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.084
Who is giving
this young lady away?

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.807
I do, but I'm going to hold
onto this one a little longer.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.770
Zack, do you take...
I do.

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.202
Before she changes her mind.

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.211
And do you, Kristin?

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.163
I do, and I won't
be changing my mind.

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.409
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.050
If you don't kiss her, I will.

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.571
I'm very calm right now.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.051
I see that.
I'm very happy.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.000
That's very nice. Let's
take a picture of that.

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.883
Hold it high so we
both look skinny.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.930
It's nothing.
I'm fine.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.560
I know, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.608
It's not scary, okay?
Scary.

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.841
It's not scary.

01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.005
Isn't that obvious?

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.041
Man down.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:11.088
Come on, come on, come on!
Seriously? All right.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.282
Hey. This is not a stadium,
it's a lobby.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.966
Yeah, your hat, Hector!
Put on your hat.

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.451
What?

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.256
All right, this is not...
This is the wrong borough.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.725
I'm from Manhattan.
The other one.

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.801
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.881
Okay, we're ready.

01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.696
How's this going? This is
going to work very well.

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.008
Okay. This is not
a stadium, this is a lobby.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.650
You were not
an essay-contest winner.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:37.884
But I do have this 100%
hypoallergenic right-side out bra,

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.048
for you to
wear home since you're

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.046
exposed on that side. Oh,
that's so kind of you.

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:45.925
Thank you. Pop that on.
Gold plated.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.286
Is this yours?
Well...

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.167
It's one really... long train.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.571
Jesus!

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.522
I need to shave my legs again quickly.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.640
Hold him still.
Okay.

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.606
He's moving.

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:18.081
Tanner, no, no, no, no,
not on her bag!

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.080
It's, like, the fourth
time he's done this.

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.442
Enough with
the surprises, Sandy.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.249
Sandy? I'm Sandy.

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:29.376
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not
here for a picture.

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.845
I'm here...
I'm here to show Julia.

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:40.770
Jusflfied.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.165
Sweetie, sweetie, your banana.
Sorry, your banana.

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.281
Oh!

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.968
Whoa!

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:54.840
Oh, it's connected to a string.

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.968
What? This is a big joke.

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.521
Maybe it's dental floss.
New thing dentists are doing.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.329
Happy Mother's Day!

01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.696
- Went actually very well.
- She's so good!

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.643
- Yay.
- Go again.
