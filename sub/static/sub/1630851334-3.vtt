WEBVTT

01:28.797 --> 01:31.966
CHIEF, I CAN'T GO TO THE STATION TODAY.
I'LL CONTACT YOU LATER.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.482
EPISODE 3
THE MAN WITH THE UMBRELLA

02:53.131 --> 02:54.424
Ready.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.801
Begin player inspection.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.686
NAME: SEONG GI-HUN

03:48.770 --> 03:50.313
NAME: CHAE GANG-SUN

05:06.764 --> 05:08.099
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

05:17.608 --> 05:18.693
Hey, you!

05:27.493 --> 05:28.536
Sorry.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.580
I just got seasick.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.376
Did you forget the rules?

05:36.085 --> 05:38.629
You do not speak
unless your superior allows you to.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.217
Go standby in the cabin.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.358
Hey, sir.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.697
Wake up, sir.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.743
Wake up. Get up, huh?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.037
Uh-huh.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.914
Are you all right?

07:36.998 --> 07:38.082
You're here.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.046
So Player 456 came back.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.339
Yeah.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.467
I got scared.
I thought you were gone for good.

07:49.135 --> 07:53.014
Hey. I won't die so easily, you know.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.849
I know you won't.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.768
I stopped playing because of you,
and I'm back because of what you said.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.437
I'm actually sort of partial to you.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.990
A lot of people
decided to come back.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.619
You're right. Hmm.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.038
-Yeah.
-I guess everybody's desperate.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.998
-Oh.
-Huh?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.919
There, look. That's the woman who couldn't
name her kid. She came back too.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.003
You're right.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.215
Think she named her kid yet?

08:27.715 --> 08:28.716
I don't know.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.717
Gi-hun.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.052
Oh, Sang-woo.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.265
So you're here.
I didn't think I'd see you.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.062
Neither did I.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.439
And you?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.234
Your mom, did you see her?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.570
Hey, good sirs.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.489
Oh. Hey.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.199
It's my angel.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.201
I'm happy to see both of you.
I hope we make it.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.913
Thanks for the bus fare, sir.
It meant so much to me.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.581
What, you gave him the bus fare?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.833
Because he said that
he'd walk Yeouido to Ansan.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.503
That's so heartwarming.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.339
We're like a bunch of soldiers
at training camp, huh?

09:08.422 --> 09:10.383
A training camp is what?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.387
You know, it's like the army
shooting guns.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.098
Oh! Soldiers all training together?

09:17.181 --> 09:18.057
Uh-huh.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.892
Wait a minute.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.896
Since we're on the subject now,
you should join me.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.982
We should just form our own team,
don't you think?

09:26.065 --> 09:29.235
You're right. Who knows what game
they'll have us play next.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.572
It wouldn't hurt to be in a group
so we're ready for anything.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.616
Hey, you should join up with us.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.160
I mean, we already know he's crazy strong.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.162
You saw it.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.082
He lifted me up with one hand
like it was nothing at all.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.503
You mean… that you… I can join you?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.299
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, so then,
you'll be the new recruit.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.676
He's the skilled corporal,
and that means I'm a sergeant.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.596
Oh, man. Thank you, sir.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.056
-Please just drop the "sir," will you?
-Excuse me.

10:00.057 --> 10:04.895
If you don't mind,
can I join up with all of you?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.105
Yeah, of course.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.774
And you can be the… Hold on…

10:08.858 --> 10:12.111
So you can be the old major
who's been in the army his entire life.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.946
Thanks so much.

10:14.530 --> 10:18.701
Yeah. Quite a team we got going here.
Damn! Let's do this.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.289
I'll take you in again
and look past everything.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.249
Come and join us.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.128
We were a good team
for a while out there, huh?

10:29.670 --> 10:30.963
Are you actually serious?

10:32.506 --> 10:34.634
I mean, everybody out there
is still looking for you.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.177
Stop with the act.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.638
It doesn't matter how tough you are,

10:38.721 --> 10:41.474
you're not going to win in this place.
Not on your own.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.769
Didn't you notice?

10:44.852 --> 10:46.729
Those jerks with masks came in

10:46.812 --> 10:48.522
and removed the beds
of the people who died.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.442
Make one mistake out there,
and yours is next.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.945
Worry about your own ass, okay?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.866
Don't join him.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.077
This guy's a dumb dumbass.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.373
He liked to pick
all of his little minions' pockets

11:05.456 --> 11:07.500
just so he could fill up his own.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.128
He got bold enough one day
to go after his head honcho's pockets,

11:11.212 --> 11:12.213
but now he's in here.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.298
'Cause he was stupid and got caught.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.885
You know what people in my hometown
would call you, huh?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.890
A damn revolutionary asshole.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.227
You communist little bitch, I'm gonna…

11:26.894 --> 11:28.813
Excuse me.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.815
Am I interrupting you?

11:31.399 --> 11:32.525
Sorry.

11:32.608 --> 11:33.818
What is it?

11:33.901 --> 11:34.777
Oh, boy.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.904
You're really good looking.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.493
Come on, let me join you guys.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.452
Join what?

11:44.036 --> 11:45.746
I'll be your teammate.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.126
Tell me what you're good at?

11:50.209 --> 11:52.294
Everything, except the things I can't do.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.340
And I'm certainly better
than some skinny girl.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.843
A lot better.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.469
You mean, you're that good?

12:03.806 --> 12:05.015
How about it?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.059
Plenty of empty beds.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.691
Attention.
Your mealtime begins now.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.985
-All players, please form a line…
-Maybe later.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.153
…in the center of the room.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.655
Let me repeat the instruction.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.742
Attention. Your mealtime begins now.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.953
All players, please form a line
in the center of the room.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.210
Assholes.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.272
Out of 201, 187 returned.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.900
The re-entrance rate is 93 percent.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.363
Keep an eye on the ones
who didn't return to play

13:01.947 --> 13:03.157
and keep me posted.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.366
Yes, sir.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.345
-Mm…
-Ahh…

13:25.387 --> 13:27.139
This brings back old memories.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.433
Do you remember eating lunches
like this too?

13:29.517 --> 13:30.392
Of course.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.605
My wife was always in the kitchen
every morning.

13:34.688 --> 13:39.318
She'd pack lunches just like these ones
for me and my kids.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.571
I wish the rice was piping hot.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.158
At least they could've
warmed it up a little.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.285
All we need is a stove.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.620
Remember doing that?

13:51.080 --> 13:54.375
The little briquette stove we had
in our elementary school classroom.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.835
We'd stick our lunch boxes on it.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.128
It'd get burning hot on us too,

13:58.212 --> 13:59.880
and the rice'd get all scorched. Hmm?

14:01.882 --> 14:02.842
Gi-hun.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.968
Hmm?

14:04.051 --> 14:05.970
Let's try to stay on the subject.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.180
How about putting your mind
to what the game could be?

14:09.932 --> 14:10.808
Mm.

14:10.891 --> 14:11.809
Hey.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.144
No one can figure that out.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.188
We'll find out when it's time.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.693
You know, considering the last one
that we did,

14:20.776 --> 14:26.031
I think that there'll be another old game
kids played, just like I used to.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.658
I'll bet you right there.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.202
Think of all the ones they could choose.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.037
Ddakji,Dabanggu,

14:32.121 --> 14:33.998
there's Hopscotch, Biseokchigi,

14:34.081 --> 14:36.292
and Tag, Don Katsu, Freeze Tag.

14:36.792 --> 14:41.046
And for girls, there's Gonggi, Elastics,
Cat's Cradle and…

14:42.590 --> 14:43.841
And what else?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.552
I don't know how to play those.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.638
You don't know any of the games I listed?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.474
Hey, listen to me.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.685
All those games are easy to learn.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.478
And we'll teach them to you.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.857
That's much appreciated.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.409
Attention.
The work schedule is done for today.

15:10.492 --> 15:14.788
All active staff, please take this time
to return to your rooms.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.083
Let me repeat the instruction.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.420
The work schedule is done for today.

15:22.046 --> 15:26.383
All active staff, please take this time
to return to your rooms.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.629
1. ALWAYS WEAR YOUR MASK
OUTSIDE THE ROOM

16:03.712 --> 16:04.838
2. DO NOT CONVERSE
WITHOUT PERMISSION

16:04.922 --> 16:06.173
3. DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM
WITHOUT PERMISSION

16:10.844 --> 16:13.889
Hey, hey, hey!
Open the door, you jerks!

16:13.973 --> 16:16.934
I have to pee really bad, right now!

16:17.017 --> 16:18.894
Don't you jerks ever take a leak?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.397
Let me use the restroom! I gotta go now!

16:21.897 --> 16:25.567
Hey, just let me use the bathroom
for one second. Jeez, come on!

16:26.068 --> 16:28.988
Look, it's mostly men in here, okay?
Want a puddle here?

16:30.698 --> 16:33.200
Damn it! Damn you, scumbags!

16:33.283 --> 16:34.535
I hope you're ashamed.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.787
Treat us like humans, damn it!
Who do you think you are?

16:37.454 --> 16:39.581
Hey, Triangle.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.042
I don't need you. Get me your superior.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.254
Just get me that some square head guy!

16:47.631 --> 16:51.176
You may not leave
this room past your given curfew.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.556
Damn it. You masked guys think
you control when I'm supposed to pee, huh?

16:57.766 --> 16:58.976
Oh, what the…

16:59.560 --> 17:01.562
You freaking bastards!

17:01.645 --> 17:04.440
You don't think
I'll go pee right here and now?

17:04.523 --> 17:05.566
Shit!

17:06.400 --> 17:08.360
Here I go.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.363
You all ready to hear some rain?

17:16.827 --> 17:17.745
Follow me.

17:17.828 --> 17:21.957
Damn, Koreans won't listen to someone
until they start screaming at you.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.333
Goddamn it.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.295
I gotta go.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.882
Oh, yeah?

17:29.965 --> 17:32.092
I beg to get the damn toilet,

17:32.176 --> 17:34.178
and you're gonna sit
right on top of it like that?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.013
Hey.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.600
You're a pretty annoying girl, aren't you?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.480
What a rude little brat.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.522
Hey.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.245
That's so damn good--

19:24.580 --> 19:25.956
Don't scare me like that.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.416
What?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.506
Wanna smoke a little?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.800
You can stay put on the bowl
and smoke some more.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.388
What are you doing?

19:49.563 --> 19:50.606
Wait.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.524
Are you going to go in there?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.276
I wanna see what's up there.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.572
Buy me some time.
Then I'll tell you if I find anything.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.993
Deal. Step up here.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.626
Oh, my God!

20:52.709 --> 20:54.878
I bet the hell I've been here today.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.801
It hurts a lot!
It's like trying to push out a kid!

21:01.510 --> 21:03.095
Ah! I'm dying!

21:09.309 --> 21:10.769
I'm dying.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.688
Why won't it come out?

21:27.244 --> 21:30.080
It's time to go back.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.083
Just give me a second, okay?

21:33.166 --> 21:35.544
Come on, you. Oh, it's all blocked.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.754
You bastard, get out!

21:37.838 --> 21:40.757
Hurry the hell up! We're in a rush, okay?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.301
You need to go back.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.802
Come out now.

21:43.885 --> 21:47.055
Wait! Stop! No! Wait!

21:47.139 --> 21:50.058
They're gone.
All of the stool wipes are gone!

21:50.142 --> 21:51.518
Ah, shit.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.813
Yeah, but I'll use the sink.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.399
No, don't come in.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.651
You just stay out there.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.486
Did you hear that?

22:01.570 --> 22:04.406
Don't come in here.
I'm not wearing pants, okay?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.533
Okay.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.494
The water is still nice in here.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.511
What?

22:27.012 --> 22:28.180
Keep stirring.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.939
You have to come out.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.275
Damn it!
There's no toilet paper here either!

22:40.359 --> 22:43.487
-If you don't, I'll drag you out.
-I have to wipe myself, okay!

22:43.570 --> 22:46.615
Hey, aren't you supposed to check
each stall for toilet paper?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.200
Get that square guy here!

22:48.283 --> 22:49.910
I need to file a complaint.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.538
You bastard, what the hell?

22:54.664 --> 22:56.208
I can't believe this.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.796
You little bastard! You…

23:01.296 --> 23:02.589
Hey, jerkface.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.008
You, I said don't come in, didn't I?

23:05.092 --> 23:07.219
You harassed us in there, yeah?

23:07.886 --> 23:11.473
Hey, the second I'm out of here,
I'll sue your ass, okay?

23:11.556 --> 23:14.101
Is that clear? Asshole!

23:23.652 --> 23:25.821
It's now time for you to go to sleep.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.115
Congratulations on a good day's work.

23:46.341 --> 23:52.472
The island, abductions,
surveillance, and the masks…

24:13.994 --> 24:16.413
Hey, what did you see? Huh?

24:17.289 --> 24:18.874
Come on. What did you see?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.251
I'll tell you tomorrow.

24:21.334 --> 24:24.504
Why tomorrow? Just tell me now.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.631
Hey. What did you see?

24:27.382 --> 24:31.803
You must have seen something.
You were up there for so long. Come on.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.396
Good morning, everyone.
A new day has dawned.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.065
Please wake up and prepare
for your duties.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.527
In ten minutes,
the staff head count will begin.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.327
Attention.
It is now time for breakfast.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.538
All players, please form a line
in the center of the room.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.498
Hey.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.460
What did you see? Tell me now.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.172
It's the morning now, you said you would.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.840
You were in there for a while, so go on.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.510
Masked guys with pots, and they
were melting a liquid down there.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.094
What was it?

25:14.846 --> 25:15.805
I couldn't tell what.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.057
Goddamn it!

25:17.557 --> 25:20.435
I had to put on that whole show
just to save your life back there,

25:20.519 --> 25:21.853
and you couldn't tell?

25:25.106 --> 25:26.274
I smelled it, though.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.484
What did it smell like?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.694
Sugar or something.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.904
You kidding me?

25:31.446 --> 25:33.698
Are you saying
they were melting sugar in there?

25:33.782 --> 25:34.950
I think they were.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.660
So, it was just that?

25:42.332 --> 25:43.375
Girl.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.004
Look, if you aren't telling me everything.
I'll burn your eyes out with cigarettes.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.553
I guess I'm hungry.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.221
I'm craving something sweet.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.306
Goddamn it.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.434
Maybe they'll give us
candied sweet potatoes today.

26:24.165 --> 26:28.545
Beginning headcount now.
Please wait in front of your door.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.218
Head count complete.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.137
All staff, proceed.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.701
Hey, is there…

27:00.493 --> 27:03.705
any chocolate milk?
I can't drink the normal kind.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.083
Oh, when I was a kid,
I had problems digesting it,

27:07.167 --> 27:09.669
so I just skipped milk
when I was in school.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.512
Ah, shit.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.805
My goodness.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.434
As a kid, I'm willing to bet
you got spanked a lot.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.353
How did you know?

27:26.436 --> 27:29.272
My son did too.
He was just like you, friend.

27:40.533 --> 27:41.368
Hey, sir.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.120
Why aren't you eating that?

27:47.749 --> 27:48.708
Have it.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.378
Do you mean it?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.463
I don't eat most mornings.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.758
Thanks so much, sir.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.469
You know, geniuses never eat much.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.519
Take mine too.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.189
Thank you, sir.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.575
Attention.
The second game will begin shortly.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.828
Please follow the staff's instructions

28:24.911 --> 28:27.580
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.541
I will now repeat the instructions.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.837
Attention.
The second game will begin shortly.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.256
Please follow the staff's instructions

28:36.339 --> 28:38.842
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.982
You saw something, right?

29:38.651 --> 29:40.570
I happen to overhear
your discussion last night.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.238
So tell me, what did you see?

29:43.907 --> 29:45.074
Why would I?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.202
You're a defector, right?

29:48.369 --> 29:50.872
All the games they made us play in here
are games I have known

29:50.955 --> 29:52.165
since I was a young boy.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.585
The next game will be too,
I'm willing to bet.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.961
You tell me what you saw,

29:57.629 --> 29:59.380
I might guess what it is.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.063
Why the hell is this playground so huge?

30:58.147 --> 30:59.816
What's the game here?

30:59.899 --> 31:01.818
Players,
welcome to the second game.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.152
We will begin shortly.

31:03.236 --> 31:06.406
Hey, what do we think? Huh?

31:06.489 --> 31:07.949
Maybe that roundabout there.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.785
Jungle gym without falling?

31:10.869 --> 31:11.995
Huh?

31:12.078 --> 31:14.789
Players,
before the second game begins,

31:14.873 --> 31:18.084
choose one of the four available shapes
you see on the wall.

31:18.167 --> 31:21.379
Once you've chosen your shape,
please stand in front of it.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.881
Does she mean those?

31:23.673 --> 31:25.884
So our options are circle, triangle,

31:26.843 --> 31:28.303
star, umbrella.

31:28.803 --> 31:32.682
I don't know. They seem very familiar.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.853
You tell me what you saw,
I might guess what it is.

31:37.937 --> 31:39.564
They were heating sugar.

32:01.878 --> 32:02.879
Sang-woo.

32:02.962 --> 32:03.963
Huh?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.006
Got anything?

32:06.925 --> 32:07.967
Not yet.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.765
Choose a shape
and stand in front of it immediately.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.978
Choose a shape
and stand in front of it immediately.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.565
What do you think it could be?

32:29.739 --> 32:31.074
Should we play this together?

32:34.077 --> 32:35.161
That could be dangerous.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.956
At this point, we don't know anything.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.500
I think it would put us at a disadvantage
if we just choose one.

32:40.583 --> 32:41.709
You think?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.378
There's this saying in investing.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.546
"Try not to keep your eggs
in the same basket."

32:47.340 --> 32:48.675
Listen to him.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.552
He was first in his class
in SNU Business School.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.263
And in my hometown,
he was a genius. A prodigy.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.641
Really? Is that so?

32:56.724 --> 32:58.810
Well then, he is an incredible guy, huh?

32:58.893 --> 33:00.353
Are you kidding me?

33:00.979 --> 33:05.525
Like Sang-woo told us, let's all split up
and take it from there, huh?

33:06.275 --> 33:07.652
Who should go where?

33:12.615 --> 33:14.492
All right, let me go triangle.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.119
What about you?

33:18.037 --> 33:18.871
Dayira.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.041
-Huh?
-Dayira.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.793
-A circle, you mean?
-Yeah.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.170
It looks just like the moon
where I'm from.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.633
That means we have star and umbrella.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.763
You pick first. Go on.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.640
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.106
-Uh, then I'm choosing the umbrella.
-Hmm?

33:45.690 --> 33:46.524
You sure?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.026
Why?

33:49.027 --> 33:52.488
Oh, growing up, I'd always lose
my umbrella so my mom would get angry.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.866
So then, she gave me broken ones
to bring to school.

33:55.366 --> 33:58.077
I always wanted her to get me
one of those good umbrellas

33:58.161 --> 34:00.163
-like the other kids.
-Mm-hm.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.916
Um, don't want the star?
Or do you wanna switch with me?

34:04.000 --> 34:07.503
Oh, no, the star sounds great.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.213
Good with me.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.468
Besides, nobody really sees
many stars these days.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.636
Great, let's get moving.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.140
Once we know what we're up against,
let's set up a strategy together.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.058
Sure.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.268
-All right.
-Hmm.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.104
Gi-hun, wait.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.898
Huh?

34:31.778 --> 34:32.695
Nothing.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.804
The time to select your shape has ended.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.848
I will now explain the rules
of the next game.

35:07.855 --> 35:12.819
All players, please take one case each
from the table at the front of your line.

35:13.611 --> 35:18.866
All players, please take one case each
from the table at the front of your line.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.227
Please take a moment to open the case
and check the contents.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.272
HONEYCOMB

36:04.787 --> 36:06.038
What does this mean?

36:11.210 --> 36:14.755
The second game is sugar honeycombs.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.340
The shape you have chosen

36:16.424 --> 36:19.135
is the shape you must remove
from the honeycomb.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.598
I'm dead.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.478
The time limit is ten minutes.

36:30.229 --> 36:34.150
You will pass if you trim out the shape
without it breaking or cracking

36:34.233 --> 36:35.193
within the time limit.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.862
With that, let the game begin.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.238
Wait…

38:45.114 --> 38:46.115
One more chance.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.117
Please. No, please don't…

39:10.014 --> 39:11.766
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.059
Don't do it, sir.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.393
Please don't…

40:46.735 --> 40:48.529
Player 111, pass.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.660
Player 67, pass.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.801
The Dayira. I did it. I'm done.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.263
Look, I'm done.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.350
Player 199, pass.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.355
Player 210, pass.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.112
Player 224, pass.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.116
Player 246, pass.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.081
Player 73, pass.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.628
Number 29.

41:45.711 --> 41:47.963
-Player 72, pass.
-Sir?

41:48.047 --> 41:49.256
What's your duty today?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.800
-Player 34, pass.
-My duty is--

41:51.884 --> 41:54.053
29, your duty
is carrying out eliminated players.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.179
Why are you here now?

41:55.262 --> 41:57.765
-I'm sorry.
-Player 44, pass.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.099
I got confused.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.268
Wait here till after the game ends.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.563
I'll have a word with you
about that confusion.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.484
Player 32, pass.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.619
To the left.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.336
Player 122, pass.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.797
Player 29, pass.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.346
Player 218, pass.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.029
Player 357, pass.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.616
Player 83, pass.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.715
Right.
I can melt it from the back.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.635
The outline is thinner,
so it will melt first.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.747
Player 212, pass.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.128
Player 196, pass.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.632
Player 244, pass.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.096
Player 69, pass.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.931
Player 70, pass.

46:42.007 --> 46:45.010
Player 456, pass.

46:53.894 --> 46:56.522
Your time to remove your shape is now up.

46:56.605 --> 47:00.317
All successful players,
please leave the playground immediately.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.610
Move your hands.

47:26.009 --> 47:27.719
You see this, assholes, huh?

47:28.387 --> 47:31.431
Goddamn it!
What kind of sick game was that?

47:31.515 --> 47:35.769
Why do some people got easy shapes
while we all get shitty umbrellas, huh?

47:36.353 --> 47:38.272
Hey, you assholes, step back in there.

47:39.147 --> 47:41.608
Stay there. I'll shoot.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.861
I'll shoot! Shoot him right here!

47:43.944 --> 47:45.320
Goddamn it!

48:14.057 --> 48:15.434
Take off your mask.

48:16.393 --> 48:18.145
Don't make me shoot.

48:36.204 --> 48:38.081
Turn around, okay.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.798
You're just a kid.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.009
What did they do to you?

49:10.197 --> 49:11.365
Remember.

49:12.032 --> 49:14.785
Once they find out who you are, you die.

49:31.885 --> 49:35.681
Number 29,
standby and await further instructions.

49:35.764 --> 49:38.141
I'll have a word with you
about that confusion.
