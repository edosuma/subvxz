Not that I have any business
suggesting that.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.291
I might die because
I'm still hung up on Paul.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.696
No.

36:37.729 --> 36:41.166
I don't want to move on.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.368
If she doesn't feel like...

36:42.401 --> 36:45.737
I always knew
I could be a good doctor.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.109
But until I met Lea,

36:51.142 --> 36:53.412
I never knew
I could drive a car.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.683
Or enjoy music.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.551
Or sing karaoke.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.553
Or take tequila shots.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.854
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:04.356 --> 37:06.124
Or fall in love.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.627
**

37:12.331 --> 37:17.035
I don't want to stop being
the person I am with her.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.574
Lea makes me more.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.220
(ON RADIO) But I don't
make her more.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.459
If I did,

37:41.393 --> 37:43.895
then Lea would want
to be my girlfriend.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.666
**

38:12.391 --> 38:14.259
(ALARM BEEPING)

38:15.093 --> 38:17.228
She's tachycardic
and hypotensive.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.330
Abdomen?

38:19.331 --> 38:20.399
Rigid.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.200
Her fallopian tube
ruptured.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.503
**

38:25.671 --> 38:26.672
(COUGHS)

38:32.944 --> 38:34.646
Any chance
he can wait an hour?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.549
Rapidly expanding
subdermal hematoma.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.251
**

38:56.334 --> 38:59.037
**

39:05.611 --> 39:08.013
It still doesn't hurt.
Can't this wait?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.615
We need to fix something
right away.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.282
Okay.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.086
Whatever you gotta do,
I guess.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.056
Hey, um,

39:18.089 --> 39:19.190
about my dad...

39:19.224 --> 39:21.026
The minute he lands,
we'll get him here.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.329
Thank you.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.632
**

39:29.000 --> 39:30.669
Okay. (SIGHS)

39:39.711 --> 39:41.980
She needs a surgeon...
Stat.

39:42.013 --> 39:45.083
(MONITOR BEEPING)

39:45.116 --> 39:46.351
I'm a surgeon.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.555
Harmonic scalpel,
DeBakey forceps,

39:49.588 --> 39:51.322
two Yankauer suctions,
and vasopressin.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.662

40:14.045 --> 40:15.046
Marta?

40:18.550 --> 40:19.985
Can you squeeze
Noreen's hand?

40:24.790 --> 40:26.024
Let's get you
to the hospital.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.459
(CRYING)

40:29.060 --> 40:32.197
(WEAKLY) You two,
free beer for life.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.264
(BOTH LAUGH)

40:33.298 --> 40:35.366
(RUMBLING)
Whoa.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.868
Watch it!
Aftershock!

40:36.902 --> 40:39.137
(CLATTER)
SHAUN: We need to
immobilize your leg.

40:40.338 --> 40:41.406
Cover your head.

41:00.792 --> 41:01.927
All right,
get her out of here.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.094
Right.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.132
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:07.165 --> 41:08.333
That was a big one.

Oh! Are you okay?

41:11.570 --> 41:12.604
(COUGHS)

41:12.638 --> 41:14.472
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

41:14.506 --> 41:16.908
Just a little...
A little motion...

41:16.942 --> 41:18.443
Oh!

41:18.476 --> 41:20.979
**

41:22.981 --> 41:24.650
I need oxygen here now!

You okay?

41:33.659 --> 41:35.260
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:35.293 --> 41:36.327
What about our patient?

41:36.361 --> 41:37.596
Vitals stable.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.032
Shaun,
you okay down there?

41:43.001 --> 41:44.135
(WATER RUSHING)
I am okay.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.406
Except for the water.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.721
Please hurry.
