- Okay.
- So I guess that was

31:51.484 --> 31:53.160
part of the reason why
I was overthinking so much

31:53.244 --> 31:54.819

same mistake,

31:54.904 --> 31:56.830
you know?

31:56.989 --> 32:00.241

in a relationship in a while,

32:00.326 --> 32:02.169
and you think--

32:02.253 --> 32:04.421

100% in when

32:04.505 --> 32:05.997
you've been single

that I'm trying to put 100% in.

32:14.006 --> 32:18.018
it could be seen that I'm not,
I kind of get nervous.
