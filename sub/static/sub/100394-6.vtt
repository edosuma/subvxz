WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:01.988
Previously on "Project Blue Book"...

00:01.990 --> 00:03.030
He's one of yours?

00:03.040 --> 00:04.779
He's working with the Americans now.

00:04.780 --> 00:07.659
I'm going to kill him for you,
and then we'll be even.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.780
You do make a pretty good team.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.810
Yeah, he's not bad for
Central Intelligence.

00:12.830 --> 00:14.660
What's the Robertson Panel?

00:14.670 --> 00:16.839
It seems Central Intelligence

00:16.840 --> 00:18.839
will put the US Air Force on trial.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.960
With a full investigation
into Project Blue Book.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.839
Ufology, the... the
classification system?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.339
Close encounter of the first kind,

00:24.340 --> 00:26.190
visual sighting less than 500 feet away

00:26.200 --> 00:28.099
showing angular extension and detail.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.280
Second kind of encounter
with a physical effect,

00:30.290 --> 00:32.430
car dying, lights flickering.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.590
Scale you're working on?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.008
I think we have strong evidence here

00:35.010 --> 00:36.899
for a close encounter of the third kind.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.560
And cut!

01:44.570 --> 01:46.650
Cut it!

01:48.760 --> 01:50.020
Allen?

01:50.030 --> 01:51.120
What are you doing?

01:51.130 --> 01:54.300
Just taking it all in.

01:54.310 --> 01:55.940
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:59.510 --> 02:01.270
What is that?

02:01.280 --> 02:03.690
I hear it's something
Steven's working on.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.120
The reporter's here. Are you ready?

02:07.130 --> 02:09.160
Uh-huh.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.098
Thank you so much for
agreeing to do the interview.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.270
It's my pleasure.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.580
So, Steven Spielberg calls
you up out of the blue

02:15.590 --> 02:17.720
and says, "I'd like my next movie

02:17.730 --> 02:19.520
"to be based on your work,

02:19.530 --> 02:21.620
"name it after your
classification system,

02:21.630 --> 02:23.974
and have you as my technical advisor."

02:23.975 --> 02:25.240
Yeah, something like that.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.610
Not bad for a college
professor from Ohio State.

02:27.620 --> 02:30.150
That... is exactly what my wife said.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.890
You know, reading the script,

02:31.900 --> 02:35.359
Richard Dreyfuss's character
reminded me of someone.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.590
Oh, you think so?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.790
Family man, obsessed with alien life,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.150
outwits military and government forces

02:41.160 --> 02:43.490
in order to uncover the truth.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.040
That doesn't sound like you?

02:46.340 --> 02:47.800
Well, I suppose it does,

02:47.810 --> 02:50.300
only Richard Dreyfuss never had
to face the Robertson Panel

02:50.310 --> 02:51.319
on his way up the mountain.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.629
Ah, the Robertson Panel.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.550
That was the CIA

02:54.560 --> 02:56.590
convening an elite group of scientists

02:56.600 --> 03:00.680
to study your work in '53, yes?

03:00.690 --> 03:03.260
Yes, um, something like that.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.520
There's more to the story.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.120
There's a lot more.

03:12.770 --> 03:15.479
Well, I'm sure our readers
would love to hear about it.

03:17.140 --> 03:19.770
- Dr. Hynek?
- Yes?

03:19.780 --> 03:20.890
What exactly happened

03:20.900 --> 03:23.200
during the events of
the Robertson Panel?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.459
They wanna shut down Blue Book.

03:31.460 --> 03:35.410
Officially, the CIA wants to
be briefed on your casework

03:35.420 --> 03:37.799
as it relates to national security.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.580
And unofficially?

03:39.590 --> 03:43.089
The agency is vying for
control of the UFO program.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.490
You set us up.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.710
All this time you spent with us.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.158
You've just been gathering
intel, haven't you?

03:48.160 --> 03:50.460
Look, I had no idea they
were going to do this.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.729
I found out when you did.

03:53.730 --> 03:56.230
I came here to help.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.649
If the CIA is in charge of this panel,

03:58.650 --> 03:59.960
and they want control,

03:59.970 --> 04:02.400
what are the odds of us even
getting an impartial hearing?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.220
That's the one piece of good news.

04:06.450 --> 04:10.150
You'll actually be presented
to a group of scientists.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.190
They'll assess the
validity of your work,

04:12.200 --> 04:14.789
report back to the agency
with their findings.

04:14.790 --> 04:17.379
Those are the men you want to convince.

04:17.380 --> 04:21.550
Dr. Menzel, Dr. Alvarez.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.030
Oh, these are serious scientists.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.130
And you should take them seriously.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.118
They'll be looking for any
reason to discredit your work.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.429
Don't give them one.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.040
We've been going through
cases all night.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.608
We have more than enough
compelling evidence...

04:32.610 --> 04:35.370
Compelling isn't good enough, Captain.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.649
You'll need to present
to them a slam dunk case

04:37.650 --> 04:40.280
with hard evidence, a credible witness,

04:40.290 --> 04:43.060
something that can't be denied.

04:43.070 --> 04:46.029
This is a chance to tell
the world your truth.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.150
You may not get this opportunity again.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.990
All right, now, I want you to watch.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.430
All right. Very carefully.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.050
And the first thing we're gonna do:

04:58.060 --> 04:59.209
we're gonna... now watch me.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.760
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:00.770 --> 05:05.250
It's there, and then we take this,

05:05.260 --> 05:06.670
put it right there.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.389
Sorta straightforward, right?

05:08.390 --> 05:11.010
Yeah.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.769
Just waiting for the magic, and...

05:12.770 --> 05:14.840
Whoa.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.190
- Where'd it go?
- You don't have it?

05:17.200 --> 05:19.670
I have no idea, but let
me just see one thing.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.939
Is it?

05:20.940 --> 05:22.149
- What is...
- How did...

05:23.350 --> 05:24.920
That what... you better keep that.

05:24.930 --> 05:27.660
Alan, I am so glad you're home.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.370
Dr. Hynek.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.230
David Dabrowski.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.400
I am so, so glad to finally meet you.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.010
Hello.

05:37.020 --> 05:41.290
Could I ask you if you would
possibly check your pocket

05:41.300 --> 05:43.000
and see if you find anything there?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.480
Maybe...

05:46.970 --> 05:48.440
Ah.

05:50.060 --> 05:52.390
Wow, Dad, how'd you do that?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.170
Well, magic.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.130
I'm gonna go put this one in my room.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.180
Okay, sweetie.

05:58.190 --> 06:01.360
David and I met at my
group this evening.

06:01.370 --> 06:03.470
Wait, who was this person?

06:03.480 --> 06:04.570
David Dabrowski.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.960
He, uh... he showed up
at Mimi's UFO group,

06:06.970 --> 06:09.270
or was led there, according to him.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.618
Isn't that what he told you?

06:10.620 --> 06:14.490
David was a bit of a
celebrity in UFO circles,

06:14.500 --> 06:17.140
and somehow, he tracked me down,

06:17.150 --> 06:21.330
claiming to have information
that only he could tell Allen.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.960
You know, when they told
me to come and find you,

06:23.970 --> 06:25.490
they didn't give me your address,

06:25.500 --> 06:27.710
and then I realized
they must've wanted me

06:27.720 --> 06:30.180
to meet your wife first.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.280
David has something I think
you might wanna see.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.350
Hmm.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.529
I'm sorry, but who exactly was it

06:48.530 --> 06:49.900
told you to come and find me?

06:49.910 --> 06:54.010
The beings that... that are
posing in that picture.

06:54.020 --> 06:58.039
And they told me to
deliver a message to you.

07:01.890 --> 07:04.450
Without my help,

07:04.460 --> 07:08.710
you will never survive
the Robertson Panel.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.130
Daniel said we needed a slam dunk case.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.598
- We don't have time for this.
- No, no, no.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.759
- He has a very compelling story.
- That we would need to verify.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.350
Which would be impossible right now.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.600
You know I have already presented you

07:24.610 --> 07:26.229
with photographic evidence.

07:26.230 --> 07:29.480
Now if you would just, please,
let me tell you my story,

07:29.490 --> 07:31.859
I think you will find it worthwhile.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.450
Okay, David,

07:36.460 --> 07:40.360
tell us about how you
first met these "beings."

07:40.370 --> 07:41.800
All right, well,

07:41.810 --> 07:46.950
the first, uh, contact was just
a little bit over a year ago,

07:46.960 --> 07:50.040
um, and it was on a stretch
of land near my home.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.709
You were alone at the time?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.800
Yes.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.090
No other witnesses?

07:58.100 --> 07:59.590
No.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.929
So you were out hiking...

08:00.930 --> 08:04.700
Surveying would be more accurate.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.180
I'm a... a volunteer
assessor for the county.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.590
I was doing my annual inspection

08:13.600 --> 08:15.150
of the Etowah River.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.270
It is the kind of work I have done
alone for many, many years,

08:20.280 --> 08:26.090
so even I did not believe what
I was seeing at first either.

08:26.100 --> 08:31.060
It was as if time and
space just vanished,

08:31.070 --> 08:37.630
and everything, the river,
and the birds, and the air

08:37.640 --> 08:41.140
went into this state
of suspended reality,

08:41.150 --> 08:44.510
except for me.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.510
That's when I saw the craft.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.950
Then came this amazing,

08:49.960 --> 08:52.890
almost electric wind.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.030
I thought, "grab your camera."

08:58.700 --> 09:02.070
But when the doors
opened, and I saw them,

09:02.080 --> 09:06.990
this incredible sense
of peace just filled me.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.530
It filled my soul.

09:11.560 --> 09:17.339
So that, when they invited
me onboard, I had to go.

09:20.220 --> 09:23.099
And what were these beings?
What were they like?

09:23.100 --> 09:26.930
They were warm, and
they were intelligent,

09:26.940 --> 09:28.700
and they were communicative.

09:28.710 --> 09:30.770
Oh, they spoke English, did they?

09:32.140 --> 09:34.890
No, they did not speak English.

09:34.900 --> 09:38.029
They communicated with
me telepathically.

09:38.030 --> 09:40.029
It's extremely difficult to...

09:40.030 --> 09:42.130
you know, I know you
think that I'm crazy...

09:42.140 --> 09:44.170
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, you do.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.699
And let me tell you something, Captain,

09:45.700 --> 09:47.870
there are things even
you cannot explain,

09:47.880 --> 09:52.460
like what you saw in the sky over D.C.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.049
How do you know I was up there?

10:00.050 --> 10:02.020
Have you tested the photograph?

10:04.600 --> 10:07.469
Because when you do, and
you find out it is not fake,

10:07.470 --> 10:10.229
then maybe you will be
able to take me seriously.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.890
That'll take some time.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.770
I know that you have been chosen

10:19.780 --> 10:21.239
to tell the truth to that panel,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.360
and I'm telling you

10:23.370 --> 10:26.970
that I have been chosen
to help you do that.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.250
But if you don't accept my offer,

10:32.260 --> 10:34.480
there is nothing I can do.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.089
Thank you for your time.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.130
You're welcome.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.939
- You tell him about the panel?
- No.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.650
And he knew about D.C.

11:02.660 --> 11:05.480
Where is he getting his information?

11:05.490 --> 11:06.909
What time is it, kids?

11:06.910 --> 11:09.510
"Howdy Doody!"

11:36.230 --> 11:38.460
Jesus, you scared the piss outta me.

11:41.190 --> 11:43.320
Most people knock, you know?

11:44.540 --> 11:45.909
The hell you watching this for?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.840
I need to see what you have.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.160
Sure, no problem.

11:56.170 --> 11:58.410
Nice to see you too, by the way.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.290
You know, it'd help if you'd tell me

12:02.300 --> 12:03.510
what you're looking for.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.930
You know, in terms of their UFO project.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.720
I mean, I'm kind of
shooting in the dark here.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.939
These photos are three years old.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.850
What are you talking about?

12:24.860 --> 12:26.090
The Americans gave you these

12:26.100 --> 12:28.860
so that I wouldn't ask questions.

12:28.870 --> 12:31.470
I know you're working for them.
I've known for a while.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.000
Are you serious right now?

12:35.010 --> 12:38.220
You accuse me of being a double agent
after everything we've been...

12:38.230 --> 12:41.590
After everything we've been
through is how I know.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.589
Oh, for Christ's sake.

12:47.590 --> 12:50.849
If I came here to kill you,
you'd be dead already,

12:50.850 --> 12:52.730
wouldn't you?

12:52.740 --> 12:55.320
They were gonna fry me
like the Rosenbergs

12:55.330 --> 12:57.519
if I didn't cooperate, but
you don't have to worry,

12:57.520 --> 12:59.398
'cause I haven't given them
anything on our program.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.149
Noth... not a thing.
I swear to God, I...

13:01.150 --> 13:04.140
Shut up. I need your help.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.150
Hey!

13:07.850 --> 13:09.819
Daria is done with me.

13:11.420 --> 13:12.740
- You with me?
- I'm with you.

13:14.850 --> 13:17.340
I'm trying to understand
what's going on, okay?

13:17.350 --> 13:21.270
All you need to know is
that if I wanted to,

13:21.280 --> 13:24.720
I could have told her about you
switching sides, but I didn't.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.590
I didn't.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.960
So now I need you to return the favor.

13:33.740 --> 13:35.390
What kind of favor?

13:37.600 --> 13:40.100
Looks pretty authentic.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.800
- Scale of one to ten?
- Seven, sir.

13:43.810 --> 13:45.540
What makes it a seven?

13:45.550 --> 13:47.189
Well, the first thing I look at

13:47.190 --> 13:48.730
is the naturalness of the boundaries

13:48.740 --> 13:50.699
around the primary object.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.110
Then I look to see if the shadows
are consistent throughout.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.449
How long would it take to
complete a full analysis?

13:56.450 --> 13:57.830
At least a couple weeks.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.320
We have the panel in two days.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.999
Is there some way to
expedite the process?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.630
If I could examine his camera,

14:04.640 --> 14:06.169
that would help me a lot.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.400
Any way you can get your hands on that?

14:13.610 --> 14:14.808
Just tell him we need the camera,

14:14.810 --> 14:16.810
get it quick, and go. Agreed?

14:16.820 --> 14:19.309
Let's just see what he has to say first.

14:32.930 --> 14:34.760
Big spread for one guy.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.780
Nice car.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.200
Guy doesn't have a front door,

14:45.210 --> 14:47.600
and wants us to take off our shoes?

14:50.920 --> 14:52.480
You found me.

14:53.550 --> 14:54.840
Come on.

14:55.620 --> 14:56.900
Come on.

14:56.910 --> 14:59.550
David, if you have the
camera that you use,

14:59.560 --> 15:00.848
it might help us validate your picture.

15:00.850 --> 15:02.850
I've got it, but I could
show you something

15:02.860 --> 15:04.850
that would remove all doubt.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.370
Trust me.

15:06.380 --> 15:07.950
What are we lookin' at here?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.530
This is where they like to land

15:09.540 --> 15:11.359
whenever they come to visit.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.900
And, uh, how often is that?

15:13.910 --> 15:15.650
Almost every full moon.

15:15.660 --> 15:18.100
- Uh-huh.
- Captain.

15:22.210 --> 15:23.999
I have never seen this before.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.040
They must've come back.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.670
- You didn't put this here?
- No.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.650
Come on, something this geometric,

15:32.660 --> 15:34.530
and... and... and precise?

15:36.490 --> 15:40.889
No, they must've left this here for you.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.650
This is a message.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.310
There we go. Three-pointed tetractys.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.290
Yeah.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.260
"An ancient Greek symbol

16:03.270 --> 16:05.789
"representing meaningful
archetypal relationships,

16:05.790 --> 16:08.879
"and symbolizing the
geometric and musical ratios

16:08.880 --> 16:12.260
upon which the foundation
of the universe is built."

16:12.270 --> 16:14.600
Three lines. Three points.

16:14.610 --> 16:17.930
- I know what this means.
- You discovered a triangle?

16:19.050 --> 16:22.099
They want the three of
us to work together.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.468
One partner's more than enough, thanks.

16:23.470 --> 16:25.350
What do they, uh, want the three of us

16:25.360 --> 16:26.729
to work together on?

16:26.730 --> 16:29.180
Not sure.

16:29.190 --> 16:33.609
But what if they could
tell you themselves?

16:33.610 --> 16:37.159
Mm-hmm, I'm gonna set
that up for tonight.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.570
This is a waste of time.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.080
Let's just get the camera and go.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.450
Doc, no, no. Come on,
you're not seriously thinking

16:49.460 --> 16:50.499
about going out there?

16:50.500 --> 16:51.710
We have to prep for the panel!

16:51.720 --> 16:53.770
And this is how we do it.
Look, there's no guarantee

16:53.780 --> 16:55.770
this camera is gonna
authenticate that photo,

16:55.780 --> 16:57.358
or that it's gonna be done
in time for the panel.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.718
Right, but we have plenty
of other evidence.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.770
Not on this scale,

16:59.780 --> 17:01.880
and if the encounter's
fake then so is the photo,

17:01.890 --> 17:02.978
but if it is real, it's evidence

17:02.980 --> 17:04.468
of a close encounter of the third kind.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.718
But you don't really believe
he's communicating with aliens?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.218
I'm just looking for something, anything

17:08.220 --> 17:10.119
to make sense of what
we've seen from this guy.

17:14.770 --> 17:16.779
Caught this at an Indian's game.

17:16.780 --> 17:20.630
Great American pastime.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.859
I used to go all the time with my dad.

17:23.869 --> 17:26.829
He taught me to love it.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.790
So tell me why you want me to call

17:31.800 --> 17:33.610
my contact in St. Petersburg?

17:33.620 --> 17:36.680
I need a child brought
from there to the U.S.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.339
Safely.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.219
A child?

17:40.220 --> 17:43.179
My daughter.

17:43.180 --> 17:44.760
You have a daughter?

17:44.770 --> 17:47.090
Can your contact get
her here, yes or no?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.889
He's chief of the militsiya,

17:48.890 --> 17:50.190
so he can do whatever he wants,

17:50.200 --> 17:53.890
but, um, it ain't gonna be free.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.640
How much?

17:55.650 --> 17:57.950
Five grand.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.789
Tell him you'll wire
it from your account.

18:08.490 --> 18:12.220
Um, so, I do this for
you, and you, what?

18:12.230 --> 18:14.320
You just forget you know
what you know and...

18:14.330 --> 18:17.120
My loyalty to my country
only goes so far.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.630
I suppose you and I are
the same in that way,

18:19.640 --> 18:20.770
aren't we?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.639
Call your contact.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.700
How long are we gonna give this, Doc?

18:29.710 --> 18:31.590
David, is there a timeframe

18:31.600 --> 18:33.979
for when these beings will show up?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.569
I wish it was that simple.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.310
Hey, you know what? I have a good idea.

18:43.320 --> 18:50.280
Why don't we pass the time by
doing a little bit of magic?

18:50.290 --> 18:52.510
- You got a coin?
- Magic?

18:52.520 --> 18:54.879
Come on.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.840
All right.

18:56.850 --> 18:58.830
Sure.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.100
And...

19:03.110 --> 19:06.400
This one I think, and present the hand.

19:06.410 --> 19:09.610
Thank you very much. Now close.

19:09.620 --> 19:13.590
And now, just think carefully

19:13.600 --> 19:16.610
about what are you feeling
right now, what do you...

19:16.620 --> 19:18.430
what are you feeling?

19:18.440 --> 19:20.770
Your hands are very warm.

19:20.780 --> 19:24.980
The coin is actually
disappearing, and boom!

19:28.720 --> 19:29.990
Losing your touch?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.560
What?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.370
That disappeared...

19:33.380 --> 19:36.770
God, I guess it doesn't always work.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.870
It's getting kinda late.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.130
I got 8:50. What time you got?

19:48.040 --> 19:49.760
What, how'd you do that?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.100
You just believe in magic, Captain.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.890
You will never lose your
ability to be surprised.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.369
I'm gonna go get some more firewood.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.440
- Guy's quite a character.
- Yeah, he is.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.370
Doc, what are we doing out here?

20:10.380 --> 20:11.700
I mean really.

20:12.890 --> 20:14.350
I know you don't think that aliens

20:14.360 --> 20:16.970
are gonna come down from the sky tonight

20:16.980 --> 20:20.020
and say hello to us.

20:20.030 --> 20:22.790
Certainly is a nice night, though.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.220
Yeah.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.220
Yeah, it's beautiful out here.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.060
I'm not ready to face that panel.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.840
This is a good way to avoid it.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.550
I mean, all our work, what we've seen...

20:44.250 --> 20:47.280
If they don't validate that, then what?

20:47.290 --> 20:49.780
You know, there's a lot on the line.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.800
Out here...

20:53.730 --> 20:57.679
... Is possibility,
no matter how remote.

20:59.210 --> 21:02.550
Well, look, we go there, do our best.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.470
The chips fall where they may.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.229
And if they shut us down?

21:06.230 --> 21:09.970
Well, I don't like to live in that
world. The world of "what if?"

21:09.980 --> 21:14.360
- Hello, gentlemen.
- David?

21:14.370 --> 21:15.775
What's wrong with him?

21:17.180 --> 21:18.360
David?

21:19.250 --> 21:21.300
David isn't here right now.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:24.660 --> 21:25.900
Whoa, stop it!

21:33.210 --> 21:34.940
David, are you okay?

21:34.950 --> 21:37.299
I told you this isn't David.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.710
Then who am I speaking with?

21:39.720 --> 21:42.180
I'm here to answer all your questions.

21:43.170 --> 21:47.680
David said you wanted the
three of us to work together.

21:47.690 --> 21:49.689
What are we meant to be working on?

21:49.690 --> 21:51.900
Telling the world your truth, Dr. Hynek.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.230
My truth?

21:54.530 --> 21:55.940
What is my truth?

21:55.950 --> 21:57.859
The one you can no longer deny.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.739
All right, that's enough, pal.

21:59.740 --> 22:02.480
Whoa.

22:02.490 --> 22:04.909
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

22:04.910 --> 22:07.610
You are in danger, Dr. Hynek,

22:07.620 --> 22:11.579
and David is the only
one who can save you.

22:11.580 --> 22:15.500
He is the only one.

22:15.510 --> 22:17.920
Well, if David...

22:18.740 --> 22:20.900
David, David!

22:22.580 --> 22:24.010
David!

22:28.620 --> 22:30.280
He's waking up.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.490
David?

22:42.740 --> 22:44.980
How did I get here?

22:46.540 --> 22:48.270
Oh, good, it's him again.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.470
We brought you back.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.890
You did?

22:54.680 --> 22:56.220
Here, drink this.

23:00.490 --> 23:04.650
So, uh, you don't
remember what happened?

23:05.890 --> 23:09.580
Oh, my God, I am so tired.
I just need to rest.

23:09.590 --> 23:13.879
You guys... you two should go.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.639
- I want you to go.
- Great.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.809
We'll leave you to it, then. Doc?

23:24.190 --> 23:26.580
Are you sure that you're gonna be okay?

23:26.590 --> 23:28.670
I'll be... I'll be fine,

23:28.680 --> 23:37.390
but I am not who you two
need to be worried about.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.250
Faye tells me you've been out of town.

23:49.270 --> 23:51.330
Yes, we were following up on a lead

23:51.340 --> 23:53.860
we thought might prove useful
for the Robertson Panel.

23:53.870 --> 23:56.330
Which turned out to be nothing, sir.

23:56.340 --> 23:58.530
I see.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.429
What do you plan to
present to the panel?

24:00.430 --> 24:02.210
- I would im...
- Well, General, we, um,

24:02.220 --> 24:05.140
pored over our case files
and determined a select few

24:05.150 --> 24:07.250
that we feel best represent
our investigation

24:07.260 --> 24:08.540
for the past couple years.

24:08.550 --> 24:10.210
And the conclusion you've drawn?

24:10.220 --> 24:11.668
- The conclusion, sir...
- The conclusion would be

24:11.670 --> 24:13.980
that the area of UFO investigation

24:13.990 --> 24:15.880
continues to need further study

24:15.890 --> 24:19.739
and, uh, resources to
help it to do that.

24:19.740 --> 24:22.090
This is a very important panel, Doctor,

24:22.100 --> 24:26.930
not just for your department,
but for the entire Air Force.

24:26.940 --> 24:30.020
A lot is riding on your performance.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.700
And I expect both of you to
act with honor and integrity.

24:34.710 --> 24:36.599
Yes, sir.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.560
Who wrote this?

24:44.450 --> 24:47.610
You're free to present
any case that you like,

24:47.620 --> 24:50.450
but it's important that
you finish up with that.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.320
"Therefore, based on our casework

24:54.330 --> 24:56.150
"and my own rigorous
scientific analysis,

24:56.160 --> 24:57.860
"I've concluded that
there is no evidence

24:57.870 --> 25:01.700
"to support the notion that UFOs are,

25:01.710 --> 25:04.610
"or possibly could be,

25:04.620 --> 25:06.449
extraterrestrial in origin."

25:08.710 --> 25:13.410
And you'd like me to present
this as my, uh... as my opinion?

25:14.500 --> 25:17.089
What other opinion would
you have, Doctor?

25:18.450 --> 25:19.970
Dr. Hynek?

25:19.980 --> 25:21.950
Dr. Hynek?

25:21.960 --> 25:23.380
Sorry, you were saying?

25:23.390 --> 25:25.760
You were saying, actually,

25:25.770 --> 25:27.318
that you'd been asked to read a report,

25:27.320 --> 25:29.300
one you didn't agree with?

25:29.310 --> 25:32.720
They wanted me to betray
everything I believed,

25:32.730 --> 25:35.530
to state conclusively that all UFOs

25:35.540 --> 25:37.779
have an earthly explanation.

25:37.780 --> 25:39.449
And that wasn't what you believed?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.830
It didn't matter what I believed.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.110
It mattered what the evidence showed.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.130
Science is without prejudice.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.640
It doesn't believe. It just is.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.640
And from a scientific perspective,

25:52.650 --> 25:56.710
there was one truth
that I could not deny:

25:56.720 --> 25:59.020
UFOs exist,

25:59.030 --> 26:02.080
and some defy explanation.

26:02.090 --> 26:06.349
So I was faced with a choice.

26:06.350 --> 26:10.190
Tell the lie, save Blue Book,

26:10.200 --> 26:13.399
or tell the truth, and
face the consequences.

26:13.400 --> 26:17.270
The end of my career, my reputation...

26:17.280 --> 26:18.730
And what did you decide?

26:20.530 --> 26:22.449
Sorry to do this.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.780
Steven's setting up a shot,
so we need to clear the area.

26:24.790 --> 26:28.039
Oh, of course. Uh, can we
finish this in your trailer?

26:28.040 --> 26:31.930
Actually, um, I think I've...

26:31.940 --> 26:34.250
I think I may have said too
much already, you know?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.090
So, um...

26:36.100 --> 26:38.459
I hope you have what
you need. Thank you.

26:38.460 --> 26:41.969
But, Dr. Hynek, you haven't
gotten to the panel yet.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.280
It's still hard for him to talk about.

26:46.290 --> 26:47.760
Why? What happened?

26:47.770 --> 26:51.800
Something surprised him
in the end, that just...

26:51.810 --> 26:53.900
Were you there? Uh, what was it?

26:53.910 --> 26:55.850
I was there, yes,

26:55.860 --> 26:59.270
and sometimes, I still don't believe it.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.740
Hey, Doc, why don't you come sit down?

27:25.750 --> 27:27.150
You've been like this for two days.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.338
The Mariana film is the best
piece of film evidence we have.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.089
They're not even paying attention to it.

27:31.090 --> 27:32.350
Well, they have our analysis.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.718
Hopefully, that'll help
fill in the blanks.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.190
Yeah. Without even looking at the film?

27:36.200 --> 27:38.560
That's not what scientists
are supposed to do.

27:38.570 --> 27:39.769
I know.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.709
Oh, oh, uh, excuse me!

27:45.710 --> 27:50.109
Um, are you planning to study
any individual frames?

27:52.770 --> 27:56.430
Or even watch the film again?

27:56.440 --> 27:58.230
We're done with it, actually.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.830
We spent dozens of hours
analyzing this film.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.539
You've barely even looked at it!

28:02.540 --> 28:04.940
They're F-94s.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.030
Flight logs at the Air Force base nearby

28:07.050 --> 28:08.719
confirmed they did a flyby that day.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.520
Yes, hours after that was filmed.

28:10.530 --> 28:12.198
You're... you're drawing
a false conclusion,

28:12.200 --> 28:14.290
and if you look at our
supplemental reports,

28:14.300 --> 28:17.160
you will see that we do
point out the original film

28:17.170 --> 28:18.689
was edited down by the Air Force

28:18.690 --> 28:20.989
and the more enlightening
evidence taken out.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.120
Suggesting what?

28:22.130 --> 28:24.449
Suggesting that somebody
tampered with the evidence!

28:24.450 --> 28:25.608
Do I have to spell it out for you?

28:25.610 --> 28:27.528
Well, let's just give them
a little more time here.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.680
They have all these case
files to go through.

28:29.690 --> 28:32.150
Those? We've already gone through them.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.419
That's our closed pile.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.140
Closed?

28:35.150 --> 28:39.089
Birds, weather balloons,
astronomic anomalies.

28:39.090 --> 28:41.259
We're getting to the end here, actually.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.800
You gotta be kidding me.

28:43.810 --> 28:46.190
I mean, this is over 50
case files right here,

28:46.200 --> 28:48.440
with witness reports,
photographic evidence.

28:48.450 --> 28:49.639
Which we've reviewed.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.840
No, you mean skimmed, at best!

28:51.850 --> 28:53.730
Let's take a recess.

29:08.650 --> 29:11.960
- What's happening?
- I need to get some air.

29:11.970 --> 29:14.310
- Is he okay?
- I'll talk to him.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.210
Hey!

29:28.220 --> 29:29.980
You walking off the job now?

29:29.990 --> 29:32.200
No, I'm not leaving. I'm waiting.

29:32.210 --> 29:34.340
Waiting? Waiting for what?

29:34.350 --> 29:36.170
You know, I realized
something last night.

29:36.180 --> 29:38.180
We have two options here, okay?

29:38.190 --> 29:40.180
One, I read Valentine's statement.

29:40.190 --> 29:43.380
The panel recognizes our
incompetence as investigators.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.880
Too many unsolved cases.
They shut us down,

29:45.890 --> 29:47.590
take over the program, or two,

29:47.600 --> 29:50.920
I read my statement, tell our truth,

29:50.930 --> 29:52.040
the generals bury us.

29:52.980 --> 29:55.690
Unless a third option presents itself.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.630
The hell you talking about?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.100
Now, what's he doing here?

30:04.110 --> 30:06.929
We call an expert witness,
a fellow investigator,

30:06.930 --> 30:08.659
someone whose seen our
cases, knows our work,

30:08.660 --> 30:11.139
who recognizes that the UFO phenomenon

30:11.140 --> 30:12.980
demands further investigation,

30:12.990 --> 30:15.920
and sees Blue Book as best
equipped to do just that,

30:15.930 --> 30:17.190
someone who can speak for us

30:17.200 --> 30:19.080
when we can't speak for ourselves.

30:19.090 --> 30:20.510
Third option.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.220
- Daniel.
- Professor.

30:23.230 --> 30:24.360
Captain.

30:25.550 --> 30:27.739
- They on a recess?
- No, you're just in time.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.119
Ah, better head in, then.

30:32.270 --> 30:33.970
Uh, Daniel, uh, I just...

30:33.980 --> 30:36.620
I really wanna thank you for doing this.

30:36.630 --> 30:38.640
Don't thank me yet.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.300
Come on.

30:50.260 --> 30:54.880
Gentlemen, this is my report,

30:54.890 --> 30:56.420
but since we're running out of time,

30:56.430 --> 30:59.900
I figure I would give you the
rundown in my own words.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.300
As you know, I've worked closely

31:07.310 --> 31:09.279
with Dr. Hynek and Captain Quinn

31:09.280 --> 31:11.430
over the past few weeks,

31:11.440 --> 31:14.200
so I've had a front-row view
at the Air Force's attempt

31:14.210 --> 31:18.110
to investigate and explain
the UFO phenomenon.

31:18.120 --> 31:22.760
Which is why I can assure you
with all honesty, and candor,

31:22.770 --> 31:25.459
the work these men are
doing for the Air Force...

31:25.460 --> 31:29.790
... is careless, biased,
and full of discrepancies.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.000
The sad truth is,

31:31.010 --> 31:33.259
the US Air Force has
completely mismanaged

31:33.260 --> 31:35.349
its investigation into
the UFO phenomenon,

31:35.350 --> 31:37.170
and it's high time the CIA

31:37.180 --> 31:39.389
- took that away fr...
- What is this?! What are you saying?

31:39.390 --> 31:41.730
- You son of a bitch.
- How dare you!

31:41.740 --> 31:42.899
You have no right to discredit...

31:42.900 --> 31:44.930
Of course I do!

31:44.940 --> 31:46.650
- They should be warned.
- Warned?

31:46.660 --> 31:49.240
Staging invasions,
stealing classified material,

31:49.250 --> 31:51.220
breaking onto bases,
inciting mass panic.

31:51.230 --> 31:52.308
I mean, you want me to keep going?

31:52.310 --> 31:53.828
- No, I can get you to stop.
- Oh, no, please just...

31:53.830 --> 31:55.368
Please, please can we
just settle for a moment?

31:55.370 --> 31:56.980
- Calm down.
- It's my recommendation

31:56.990 --> 31:59.960
the Air Force immediately
suspend all investigations

31:59.970 --> 32:04.150
into UFOs for the sake of
our national security.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.919
Gentlemen, please,
we have your file for review.

32:08.110 --> 32:10.629
Let's take some time to look
it over before we reconvene.

32:14.210 --> 32:15.590
He was betrayed?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.020
In front of his peers,

32:17.030 --> 32:18.679
by someone he trusted,

32:18.680 --> 32:21.740
but that's not the end of the story.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.059
He turned it around.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.399
How?

32:26.770 --> 32:28.570
Magic.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.240
I'm sorry. This was my fault.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.370
I thought he was gonna save us, Mimi.

32:41.380 --> 32:42.980
Doc, he played us both.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.500
No, you never trusted him.

32:44.510 --> 32:46.180
You're so skeptical with your work,

32:46.190 --> 32:49.070
but you're never that way with people.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.150
I suppose that makes me a fool.

32:51.160 --> 32:54.680
No, it makes you a good man.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.350
Excuse me a sec.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.800
David, the hell are you doing here?

33:02.810 --> 33:05.109
Well, it's awfully nice
to see you too, Captain.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.320
Daniel call you in, huh?

33:06.330 --> 33:08.048
You gonna go in there and
embarrass us some more?

33:08.050 --> 33:09.390
Who's Daniel?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.699
And, uh, no, I'm here for you.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.500
We don't have time for this, all right?

33:13.510 --> 33:16.200
- You need to leave.
- Leave?

33:16.210 --> 33:20.129
I am here to save you.

33:26.570 --> 33:28.470
How did you get in here?

33:28.480 --> 33:30.130
Oh.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.379
That was pleasant.
What is going on here?

33:32.380 --> 33:34.410
- How are you?
- Good.

33:34.420 --> 33:38.380
- What is this?
- It's a...

33:38.390 --> 33:41.680
- Excuse me, Dr. Stenzler.
- Yes, Captain?

33:42.660 --> 33:44.760
There's just one more case
we'd like to present.

33:44.770 --> 33:46.929
I don't think that's a good idea.

33:46.930 --> 33:50.320
Please. There's a lot on the line here,

33:50.330 --> 33:53.660
and, uh, I think you're
gonna wanna hear this

33:53.670 --> 33:55.399
before you make your ruling.

33:56.740 --> 33:59.360
Line drive, right field
in there for a base hit.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.830
Taken on hot, Morello
throws to first base.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.570
But Mays is there.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.750
How about that?

34:18.560 --> 34:20.820
He's with her.

35:16.650 --> 35:18.140
What are you doing?

35:18.150 --> 35:22.270
I guess I'm having what you
call a change of heart,

35:22.280 --> 35:25.529
and maybe it's not so smart to
let you walk out that door.

35:25.530 --> 35:28.250
Protect your identity
at all costs, right?

35:29.800 --> 35:32.910
Of all the times to
remember what I taught you.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.960
This business is tricky,

35:34.970 --> 35:37.550
and truth is, I waver all the time.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.150
But the one thing I'm clear on...

35:42.160 --> 35:44.830
I don't wanna be looking over
my shoulder the rest of my life,

35:44.840 --> 35:47.500
wondering who might
be coming to kill me.

35:47.510 --> 35:49.700
I got plans, too.

35:49.710 --> 35:52.430
I want kids of my own one day.

35:52.440 --> 35:56.979
The American dream, right?

35:56.980 --> 35:59.319
It's never too late, is it?

36:03.560 --> 36:05.279
Hey.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.989
Hey, hey!

36:06.990 --> 36:08.619
Shit.

36:10.470 --> 36:13.130
You see, what I was really
doing in here earlier

36:13.140 --> 36:15.079
was not watching "Howdy Doody."

36:15.080 --> 36:17.990
I was finding your hiding spots.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.290
Because I know you keep spares,
and when your back was turned,

36:21.300 --> 36:23.670
I switched these out and
emptied your chamber.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.030
I didn't teach you everything...

36:29.600 --> 36:31.340
For a reason.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.280
This will go down in the series called

36:33.290 --> 36:36.519
"The Battle of the Home Run."

36:38.150 --> 36:39.490
Look at that.

36:42.010 --> 36:44.819
The great American pastime.

36:46.540 --> 36:49.710
... Everybody that they possibly
can use to help them out.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.039
And the pitch. Fastball, play assist...

36:52.040 --> 36:54.370
High fly ball deep to center.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.240
That ball is going, going...

37:05.090 --> 37:07.920
Thank you all for allowing me to speak.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.980
I know you've reviewed a lot
of our case work, photos,

37:12.990 --> 37:15.040
but I think you'll better understand

37:15.050 --> 37:17.370
the value of Blue Book
by hearing from someone

37:17.380 --> 37:20.300
who's been on the receiving
end of our work. David?

37:31.910 --> 37:34.170
This is Mr. David Dabrowski.

37:34.180 --> 37:37.040
His case is the most recent one
investigated by Blue Book.

37:37.050 --> 37:40.130
Mr. Dabrowski, would you
care to tell the panel

37:40.140 --> 37:43.129
why you reached out to
Dr. Hynek and myself?

37:43.130 --> 37:47.050
I was directed to do so,
in order to be here today.

37:47.060 --> 37:49.090
And who exactly directed you?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.670
The beings from the planet Vanusios,

37:51.680 --> 37:55.370
which is two galaxies beyond ours.

37:57.980 --> 38:01.410
And did Dr. Hynek and I
investigate your case?

38:01.420 --> 38:05.069
Oh, yes, and they appreciated
it tremendously.

38:05.070 --> 38:08.569
Although you were very skeptical,

38:08.570 --> 38:10.860
which was disappointing.

38:10.870 --> 38:14.199
Well, David, we were just doing our job.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.020
They... they, um,

38:18.030 --> 38:21.539
asked if I would, uh, deliver
a message to the panel.

38:22.730 --> 38:24.250
Go ahead.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.179
Please don't be afraid.

38:35.180 --> 38:39.229
Those ships that you see in the sky

38:39.230 --> 38:41.600
and the beings you may come across...

38:41.610 --> 38:44.570
they're not here to hurt you,

38:44.580 --> 38:47.000
but to teach you.

38:47.010 --> 38:51.609
Just stay open and believe.

38:53.740 --> 38:57.360
Dr. Hynek and Captain
Quinn did their job.

38:58.980 --> 39:02.030
Nobody's listening to me now...

39:05.170 --> 39:08.379
But they will...

39:08.380 --> 39:09.660
someday.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.140
Thank you.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.309
Thank you, David.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.320
Gentlemen, David is, in some ways,

39:29.330 --> 39:32.160
a typical case for Project Blue Book.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.110
There's a sighting, Dr.
Hynek and I look into it.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.990
Are we skeptical?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.960
Yes, we are.

39:39.970 --> 39:41.600
Perhaps sometimes to a fault,

39:41.610 --> 39:44.320
but our job is to protect the public.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.930
And the real truth of it is
that without men like us,

39:47.940 --> 39:51.410
men like David can cause
a nationwide panic.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.090
Blue Book has done its job.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.520
We've closed cases.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.540
We've calmed a public
very eager to believe

40:01.550 --> 40:03.880
in aliens from other worlds.

40:03.890 --> 40:07.120
But without your support today,
the message you will send

40:07.130 --> 40:09.359
is that we were never a credible voice

40:09.360 --> 40:10.860
in the science of ufology,

40:10.870 --> 40:13.030
and that leaves thousands of cases

40:13.040 --> 40:14.640
open for reinterpretation.

40:14.650 --> 40:17.839
And, quite frankly, calls your
own reputations into question.

40:20.040 --> 40:24.170
We understand our role, gentlemen.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.870
And if you understand yours,

40:25.880 --> 40:29.540
together, we can continue
to spread our message.

40:29.550 --> 40:33.629
UFOs don't exist.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.679
Thank you.

40:48.150 --> 40:50.040
I was impressed.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.810
Laid in on a little thick, eh?

40:52.820 --> 40:55.070
You were wonderful.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.770
I guess we wait and see now.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.840
Well, truth is, whatever way it happens,

40:59.850 --> 41:01.880
I think we did our job, Captain.

41:03.790 --> 41:06.180
Hey!

41:06.190 --> 41:08.039
What, you're not gonna say good-bye?

41:08.040 --> 41:10.690
I'll give you this instead:

41:10.700 --> 41:12.750
congratulations.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.950
Looked like the tide
was turning in there.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.670
- That so?
- You must be so pleased.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.520
Well, you know what
really makes me happy?

41:19.530 --> 41:21.719
I was right about you all along.

41:21.720 --> 41:24.300
New administration.

41:24.310 --> 41:27.430
Vying for position.
Just following orders.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.750
Yeah.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.770
I can understand that.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.138
But you didn't just play against me,

41:33.140 --> 41:36.490
you played against Dr. Hynek,
and he's not one of us.

41:37.820 --> 41:40.630
All the more reason to
push him off the field.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.120
Well, game's not over, Dan.

41:44.130 --> 41:46.620
I think you may be right about that.

41:51.070 --> 41:53.169
It sounds like Quinn
really pulled a rabbit

41:53.170 --> 41:55.770
out of his hat and saved Blue Book.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.880
But that's not all he saved.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.410
The night before the panel,

41:59.420 --> 42:04.170
I wrote out a statement,
my true feelings about UFOs,

42:04.180 --> 42:06.490
that they do exist,

42:06.500 --> 42:08.910
and after David's testimony
I missed the chance

42:08.920 --> 42:12.910
to declare these beliefs that
ultimately became my legacy,

42:12.920 --> 42:16.580
a legacy that lives on in
the files of Blue Book

42:16.590 --> 42:20.060
and now in this movie.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.909
Whatever happened to David?

42:21.910 --> 42:23.510
You know, I will always have

42:23.520 --> 42:26.290
a special place in my heart for David.

42:26.300 --> 42:27.830
I mean, he was a con man,

42:27.840 --> 42:31.330
but he told us he'd save us
from the Robertson Panel,

42:31.340 --> 42:33.600
and that is exactly what he did.

42:33.610 --> 42:35.450
- Hmm.
- Professor?

42:35.460 --> 42:36.598
They're just about ready for you.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.780
Okay, thank you.
We'll find our way back.

42:40.620 --> 42:42.280
Shall we?

42:43.520 --> 42:45.140
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:50.160 --> 42:53.310
Allen, look around.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.880
None of this would be here
if it weren't for you.

42:55.890 --> 42:58.490
And I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

43:00.630 --> 43:02.390
Don't you wanna look at the UFO?

43:02.400 --> 43:05.230
Nope, I've seen those before.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.579
Show me something new.

43:14.710 --> 43:19.089
Three, one, five, four,
five, six, five, nine...
