00:08.467 --> 00:10.093
Contrary to popular belief,

00:10.177 --> 00:13.555
being a successful explorer
is not about being brave.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.934
[Sam]<i> Or even taking risks.</i>

00:30.822 --> 00:33.617
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>when you're in unfamiliar territory...</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:34.660
This Friday night.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.203
No cover before 9:00.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.455
-[people chattering]
-[music playing]

00:40.749 --> 00:42.042
Hey, what's up, man?

00:43.919 --> 00:46.046
[Sam] <i>...taking risks is the last thing</i>
<i>you wanna do.</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:47.464
You remember me?

00:49.466 --> 00:50.842
[gulps] Oh!

00:54.179 --> 00:55.472
What are you doing here?

00:58.600 --> 00:59.643
I don't know.

01:02.688 --> 01:03.522
[groans]

01:03.689 --> 01:05.399
Risks are what get you in trouble.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.818
-[doorman] Hey, what the hell?
-[barman] It's cool.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.988
[barman sighs]

01:12.030 --> 01:12.906
Look...

01:14.324 --> 01:15.576
I deserved that.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.662
[pants] We're done now.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.248
Don't come back here.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.337
[Sam] <i>Because success is about preparation</i>
<i>and planning.</i>

01:27.838 --> 01:29.631
He broke my tooth, man.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.510
And if you are in Antarctica...

01:33.635 --> 01:34.845
warm socks.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.862
[Sam] <i>Ernest Shackleton is</i>
<i>one of the top three bravest guys</i>

01:51.945 --> 01:53.488
<i>in the history of the planet.</i>

01:53.655 --> 01:55.699
<i>No one would ever disagree with that.</i>

01:56.658 --> 01:58.201
Very nice, you passed.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.918
[Sam] <i>But if he hadn't been prepared...</i>

02:09.921 --> 02:13.050
<i>he would have frozen like a Popsicle</i>
<i>in the Antarctic tundra.</i>

02:30.192 --> 02:31.026
Sam?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.071
-Did you get my invitation?
-Yes.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.532
-Are you pregnant?
-Yes.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.494
That explains the belly. Hmm.

02:43.288 --> 02:47.584
Graduating isn't exactly the same
as completing a 1,400km journey

02:47.668 --> 02:50.712
through sub-zero temperatures
with a team of sled dogs.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.424
[Sam]<i> But for me, it's not far off.</i>

02:54.508 --> 02:56.343
-Did you get married?
-No.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.513
-Is the baby a boy or a girl?
-A boy.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.140
-Who's the father?
-That's private.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.767
-Is it Miles?
-Private.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.311
Do you feel sad or happy?

03:06.395 --> 03:08.772
Thanks for asking. Happy.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.399
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.359
Can we talk about graduation now?

03:13.402 --> 03:15.362
Sam, it's a big deal.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.032
I know. And I have the third-highest GPA
in the class.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.909
Paige has the highest, which is good

03:20.992 --> 03:23.453
because she's the one
who has to give a speech, not me.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.540
-I hate speaking in front of large groups.
-Me, too.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.543
Did you pee your pants in the third
grade play in front of the school, too?

03:29.626 --> 03:32.212
[laughs] No, but I did give
a really terrible speech

03:32.295 --> 03:33.672
at my cousin's wedding.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.674
But she's divorced,
so I guess it's all good.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.591
Oh.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.010
Speech or not, this is very exciting.

03:39.845 --> 03:43.807
When you first came to me, you were
so focused on things you couldn't do and,

03:44.015 --> 03:47.811
now you've done so much.
You're becoming really independent.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.020
I'm getting there.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.898
I'll need to be completely independent
by the time I go to college.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.819
-Yeah, well, that's a tall order, but--
-Will you be at graduation?

03:56.111 --> 03:58.530
-I wouldn't miss it.
-Great. Bye, Julia.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.740
Bye.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.872
Hey, there you are. How's your hand?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.542
-[Doug] Good, fine.
-You should talk to your boss.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.545
Who knew those corners
on those metal gurneys were so sharp?

04:13.628 --> 04:14.588
It's okay.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.131
-So guess what?
-What?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.716
I finished my website,

04:17.799 --> 04:21.845
and I already have three
new hair-cutting appointments.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.722
-Three!
-Oh, good. That's cool.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.682
Yeah! It's very cool. Yeah.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.770
I mean, I know it's just a tiny thing,
but I love working with the kids.

04:29.853 --> 04:30.729
Keys?

04:31.062 --> 04:33.565
-Nope.
-How come? I'm a legal driver.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.109
-It's dinner time.
-I'll go to a drive-thru.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.195
[Sam] Oh, good. You're all here.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.947
Oh, honey, look at you. Oh!

04:41.531 --> 04:44.701
-I have to get a picture.
-No, you're a terrible photographer.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.662
-I'm getting better. Where's the camera?
-Right there.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.539
[Elsa] There we go. Okay.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.874
-This is...
-Oh, that's me.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.876
There'll be plenty of time for pictures.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.920
Why are you even wearing that?

04:55.545 --> 04:59.132
[exhales] I'm preparing for the big day,
to get used to the feeling of the gown.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.676
-Well, how does it feel?
-So far so good.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.637
But it is a little cold on my thighs.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.306
Wait-- Are you not wearing anything
under there?

05:06.389 --> 05:09.476
-So? Zahid didn't.
-Oh, gross!

05:09.559 --> 05:10.602
Zahid graduated?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.521
[Sam] Attention, please.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.440
-I've gathered you all here--
-You didn't gather us, it's dinner.

05:15.524 --> 05:19.069
...to say that while I greatly appreciate
your help over the years,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.196
I'm no longer in need of your assistance.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.113
What?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.990
Wait, what is he saying?

05:24.074 --> 05:25.951
Can you please close your legs?

05:26.034 --> 05:28.245
I'm graduating. I need to be independent.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.040
So from this point on, I'd like it if you
stopped helping me in every single way.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.500
That has nothing to do--

05:33.583 --> 05:35.877
My mind is made up. Now,
if someone could please pass me--

05:37.838 --> 05:38.755
Never mind.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.882
No. No, no!

05:40.966 --> 05:43.343
Get off me! You're naked!

05:43.426 --> 05:45.470
[Sam]
<i>Ernest Shackleton wasn't always a leader.</i>

05:45.554 --> 05:47.222
Oh, my God. I touched his butt!

05:47.514 --> 05:49.808
[Sam] <i>He got his start</i>
<i>on someone else's expedition.</i>

05:49.891 --> 05:51.268
[Casey screams] Oh, no!

05:52.727 --> 05:55.188
Sam, honey, time to wake up.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.986
You're four minutes late. Since I relied
on myself, I've been awake since 5:30.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.572
I've already read
the entire newspaper online.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.740
I'm actually very exhausted.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.909
Did you hear
about the deadly earthquake in Peru?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.370
Well, anyway, time for breakfast.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.211
[Sam] <i>When Shackleton finally</i>
<i>led his own expedition...</i>

06:18.295 --> 06:20.130
-Can I help you with that?
-Nope.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.883
<i>[Sam] ...it was based</i>
<i>on knowledge he gained</i>

06:22.966 --> 06:24.926
<i>from his time with Robert Falcon Scott.</i>

06:28.471 --> 06:30.849
-[Elsa] Honey, just let me--
-[Sam] Independent!

06:33.602 --> 06:35.604
[microwave oven beeps]

06:39.107 --> 06:41.192
Still frozen, hence...

06:41.526 --> 06:43.570
I will put them back in the microwave.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.448
[adjusting time on microwave oven]

06:46.656 --> 06:49.367
-Oh, no, honey. That's too--
-Mom, I got this.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
[burns himself]

07:10.847 --> 07:11.806
Way too hot.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.811
[Sam] <i>Shackleton learned, he applied...</i>

07:17.437 --> 07:19.189
<i>I'm sure it took practice.</i>

07:22.233 --> 07:23.777
One minute should do.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.779
You can leave.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.955
You will not believe what happened.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.708
I was practicing my valedictorian speech
in my nightly bubble bath and...

07:39.209 --> 07:41.336
[huffs] Let's just say
my note cards were involved

07:41.419 --> 07:42.837
in a vision-candle accident.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.589
Really lucky I was in water.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.343
But anyway, now I have to rewrite them
all from scratch.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.928
And buy a laminator.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.514
Well, not to pile on the bad news, but...

07:52.764 --> 07:55.475
effective immediately,
I will no longer require your services

07:55.558 --> 07:57.894
when walking down the hall
between second and third period.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.648
Oh, um...Â Okay.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.901
Will the new girl that you've been kissing
be taking over?

08:04.985 --> 08:05.819
No.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.406
So are you two in a relationship
or are you just making out a lot?

08:09.531 --> 08:13.368
Neither. We're not in a relationship,
and we only made out three times.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.996
Once on your bench
and twice not on your bench.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.831
[door opens]

08:20.750 --> 08:22.919
-Alright, here you go. Go, Owls.
-Thanks.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.671
Gardner comma Sam.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.298
Wait... You made out on my bench?

08:27.382 --> 08:30.385
-Yeah, one time.
-When? Was the paint wet?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.388
Samuel David Gardner,
are you the smudger?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.515
No, I'd have to put my back
on the bench.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.267
I never put my back on the bench.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.561
That's true.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.731
Whoo! That is a relief.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.566
-Although...
-What?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.152
Now that you mention it,
the girl I kissed,

08:47.235 --> 08:48.820
whose name I can't tell you,

08:48.945 --> 08:51.156
did get some paint on her jacket.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.117
Maybe she's the smudger.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.495
Perfect. Bye, Paige.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.249
[students chattering in distance]

09:02.167 --> 09:06.421
[Elsa] Don't you just love zucchini bread?
It's like cake with vegetables.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.435
You know...

09:21.811 --> 09:23.354
I was intimate with a woman once--

09:23.438 --> 09:24.731
Oh-- Mom!

09:24.814 --> 09:27.108
She was vibrant and...

09:27.692 --> 09:29.360
spontaneous.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.697
-She was tender.
-God, I need to bleach my ears.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.199
She was tall.

09:34.282 --> 09:38.078
She had red hair. She was kind of like
a female version of your dad.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.622
This is so terrible, my eyes are watering.

09:40.705 --> 09:44.876
Honey, I made a lot
of big mistakes this year.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.796
I've become...

09:48.588 --> 09:49.672
kind of an expert

09:49.756 --> 09:52.342
on accidentally hurting
the people I love most.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.805
So if you ever want to talk...

09:57.639 --> 09:58.598
I'm here.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.683
Sorry, I'm...

10:02.018 --> 10:04.145
I'm just still picturing a female Dad.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.856
-It's not pretty.
-You'd be surprised.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.901
-Very pretty...
-[Casey grunts]

10:10.193 --> 10:13.071
-I may have a picture.
-No!

10:15.532 --> 10:19.410
This person said, "Have a nice summer,"
which is very thoughtful.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.287
And this one said, "Stay cool,"

10:21.621 --> 10:24.457
which is funny 'cause I didn't know
I was cool to begin with.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.667
Oh, you're cool, bro.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.836
You're as cool
as a pickle in the freezer.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.921
-Hmm?
-I don't know.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.216
I usually don't let people
sign my yearbook because...

10:33.383 --> 10:35.718
I don't like to talk to people
that I don't know,

10:35.802 --> 10:37.428
but so far it's been okay.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.266
Are you really eating brownies for dinner?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.768
They're not just brownies, Samuel.

10:44.102 --> 10:47.397
They're pot brownies
and pot is a vegetable.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.983
Cousin of cauliflower, stepbro of sage.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.779
You know,Â on a proper nutritional pyramid,
dank chronic is the bottom floor.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.990
That is definitely untrue.

10:57.073 --> 11:01.327
Seems like the man eating dry cereal out
of a baggie should not be throwing stones.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.288
I've been making my own meals.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.789
I'm independent now.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.207
Speaking of which,

11:06.291 --> 11:09.627
I'll no longer require you
to give me advice about getting girls.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.172
I'd like to handle that all on my own
from now on.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.841
I accept that.
Your game is def going to suffer.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.303
But hey, bust out of that chrysalis,
little butterfly.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.139
-[Zahid laughs]
-Oh...

11:21.264 --> 11:22.974
And I have something for you.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.728
Invitation to graduation,
non-transferable.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.104
-For <i>moi?</i>
-Mm-hmm.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.733
-Sammy, I could kiss you.
-No.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.776
-I'm gonna. Let me.
-Please, don't.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.862
[Sam gasping]

11:36.738 --> 11:39.824
She said "tender."
It was the worst moment of my life.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.952
-[music playing]
-[mobile phone buzzes]

11:56.132 --> 11:58.051
So we're good right now, right?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.053
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

12:00.386 --> 12:01.846
I mean, I guess so.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.473
What, why?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.767
Well, you never gave me
my birthday present.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.979
Yeah, I gave you that neckla--
Oh, you're talking about...

12:11.147 --> 12:12.023
[Casey chuckles]

12:12.106 --> 12:13.691
Are you sure, 'cause...

12:14.359 --> 12:15.777
we could wait.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.862
[chuckles]

12:19.072 --> 12:20.907
[music continues]

12:24.953 --> 12:25.912
I love you.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.831
-I'm ambivalent.
-Hey. [chuckles]

12:28.915 --> 12:31.376
I'm, like, really ambivalent.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.130
-You see how it feels?
-[chuckles] You love me.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.468
-You do.
-Yeah. I love you.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.351
[Evan] Whoo-hoo!

12:48.935 --> 12:50.812
-Throw it away.
-[Casey chuckles]

12:50.895 --> 12:52.397
-Come here.
-[Casey moans]

12:54.857 --> 12:57.318
[Sam] <i>Of course, there's a big part</i>
<i>of being an explorer</i>

12:57.402 --> 12:59.779
<i>that involves doing things</i>
<i>you're unfamiliar with.</i>

13:00.905 --> 13:04.492
<i>That's where something called</i>
<i>a spirit of adventure comes in handy.</i>

13:04.575 --> 13:06.286
I never really had one before.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.329
Until now.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.039
[students chattering]

13:10.123 --> 13:13.084
Hi, I'm Sam Gardner.
Would you please sign my yearbook?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.045
Good, and pass it around.

13:16.921 --> 13:17.964
Bailey Bennett.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.216
You've been kissing Bailey Bennett?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.010
-Nice work, dude.
-Thank you.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.681
She left her jacket on a chair
in history class and I absconded with it.

13:26.973 --> 13:27.932
So it's true?

13:28.099 --> 13:32.353
Well, I'm not supposed to tell,
but since you found out on your own, yes.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.980
God, I can't believe this.

13:34.063 --> 13:38.192
And to be clear, the vandalism is
what bothers me here, not the kissing.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.736
You can kiss whomever you want,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.113
they're your lips.
But when it comes to my hard work,

13:42.196 --> 13:44.741
and my beautifully painted
"Live Love Laugh" bench

13:44.824 --> 13:47.869
is ruthlessly smudged,
then I do have to get involved.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.996
[Sam] <i>Turns out, not everyone in school</i>

13:50.079 --> 13:52.373
<i>thought I was cool,</i>
<i>like a pickle in the freezer.</i>

13:55.835 --> 13:57.920
-[man]<i> What a loser.</i>
-[girl]<i> What a weirdo.</i>

13:58.588 --> 13:59.589
[man]<i> Freak!</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:02.008
-[girl laughs]
-[man] <i>That kid's a spaz.</i>

14:02.091 --> 14:03.217
[Sam hearing voices]

14:03.301 --> 14:07.430
<i>And I'm holding this jacket hostage until</i>
<i>Bailey Bennett gets me a new senior gift.</i>

14:08.473 --> 14:10.016
[Paige] Wait, Sam, are you okay?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.102
Sam.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.110
-I need a new yearbook.
-But you already had one.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.197
This one is ruined and I need a new one.

14:24.280 --> 14:28.284
To be independent, you need to know
what to do when things go wrong because...

14:28.368 --> 14:30.495
you can't expect someone
to fix it for you.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.206
You need to know
how to do it yourself. [pants]

14:34.248 --> 14:37.460
Even if you really, really, really,
really don't want to.

14:37.752 --> 14:38.795
What's wrong with it?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.257
[shouts] I just need a new one!

14:43.341 --> 14:45.009
Sorry, it's one per person.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.969
[grunts]

14:47.053 --> 14:47.887
Dude!

14:47.970 --> 14:50.264
-[boy] Did you see that?
-[girl] What is he doing?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.433
[Sam] <i>Not every expedition is possible.</i>

14:52.850 --> 14:55.269
<i>Not everyone is meant to be an explorer.</i>

14:58.231 --> 15:01.275
<i>Even if you do all the right things,</i>
<i>stuff can still go wrong</i>

15:01.526 --> 15:03.694
because sometimes...

15:04.529 --> 15:05.571
some people...

15:06.239 --> 15:07.365
they're just...

15:08.658 --> 15:09.700
failures.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.370
[door rattles]

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
[mobile phone ringing]

15:26.884 --> 15:27.718
Hello?

15:31.222 --> 15:32.056
What?

15:33.558 --> 15:34.475
Whoa!

15:34.559 --> 15:36.310
-Hi.
-Are you going somewhere?

15:36.394 --> 15:37.854
No, I just heard your car.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.523
Sometimes you're just like Sam.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.151
Oh, yeah, Sam's boss Bob just called.

15:43.234 --> 15:46.279
Sam never showed up for work.
Sam has never skipped work before.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.906
I texted Zahid,
but he still hasn't texted me back.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.451
I'm really trying not to freak out,
but I am freaking out.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.369
Okay. It's okay. Calm down.

15:54.912 --> 15:55.913
It's okay.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.250
Hey, guys.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.171
I talked to Paige.
I think I know why Sam ran away.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.090
Oh, no.

16:08.009 --> 16:11.471
Why does Sam say he'll always remember
becoming a father?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.556
He's talking about the baby penguin.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.311
I think I know where he is.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.027
[indistinct chatter]

16:29.030 --> 16:30.198
Hey.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.367
Hey, little dude.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.660
Hi, Sam.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.289
You just missed feeding time.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.749
It was a real frenzy.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.959
Bad day to be a herring.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.297
You know...

16:47.924 --> 16:49.467
When you were five...

16:50.301 --> 16:51.636
I made a list.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.472
You got your love of lists from your mom.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.932
She loves a list.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.892
[chuckles] I do.

16:58.392 --> 17:03.523
Anyway, I made a list
of everything I hoped for, for you.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.776
I was trying to manage my expectations.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.236
Here.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.906
[unfolding paper]

17:12.823 --> 17:14.575
"I hope he makes a friend.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.453
I hope he can communicate clearly.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.122
I hope he can leave the house on his own.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.999
I hope he does okay in school.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.752
I hope he finds something he loves to do."

17:24.835 --> 17:26.629
-Those are so easy.
-No.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.506
They weren't. They were hard.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.051
But every time I thought
you couldn't do something, you did it.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.303
You're strong...

17:35.096 --> 17:36.264
and determined.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.601
And I'm so sorry
I underestimated you about college.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.688
You can do anything.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.568
Sometimes I just can't believe
that I have these amazing...

17:49.068 --> 17:50.111
funny...

17:50.319 --> 17:51.988
[sobs] great kids.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.286
Which one's yours?

17:58.869 --> 17:59.870
That one.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.874
-With the gray head?
-No, that one.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.918
Oh, with the white wing tips?

18:06.002 --> 18:09.297
Are you crazy? That's a male!
He looks nothing like her.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.423
Right there.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.802
-She's so cute.
-Yep.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.055
I just hope the other penguins
are nice to her.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.350
Even if they're hard on her,
every now and then...

18:21.934 --> 18:23.853
you're always going to have her back.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.110
[birds chirping]

18:37.074 --> 18:39.076
[blows]

18:47.835 --> 18:49.003
It's a big day, dude.

18:49.754 --> 18:50.796
Let's keep it cool.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.761
I was looking
at the Denton course catalog.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.804
There are so many cool classes
Sam can take.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.681
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.059
Made me kinda wish
I could go back to school.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.979
-Well, you should.
-Yeah?

19:07.271 --> 19:08.105
Why not?

19:09.649 --> 19:12.193
-Can you-- Your arm is on my side.
-No, it's not.

-[music playing on car radio]

19:19.909 --> 19:21.911
[typing]

19:27.917 --> 19:28.876
Arm!

19:29.043 --> 19:32.171
I'm taking up a reasonable amount
of space. I'm a grown man.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.923
And I'm a grown woman.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.177
-She licked me!
-Casey, really! It's graduation.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.428
I warned him.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.097
Wipe it on your robe, Sam.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.431
Are you crazy? This is a rental.

19:42.515 --> 19:46.185
Okay, for Pete's sake, I'm sure
I can find a napkin in here somewhere.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.025
Do you have a... Maybe in your jacket?

19:53.150 --> 19:55.027
[unfolds paper]

19:59.824 --> 20:01.701
Napkin? It's dry and cold.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.286
Just wipe it on your robe, honey.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.965
[seat belts unbuckle]

[door closes]

20:22.221 --> 20:23.264
[second door closes]

20:24.140 --> 20:26.016
[sighs] What did you do?

20:29.145 --> 20:31.522
Nothing, [stammers] it wasn't a big deal.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.608
You went to see him?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.653
Is that what happened to your hand?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.371
I've tried everything
to get you to forgive me.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.959
Everything. And I've been patient,
and I haven't expected much.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.505
[sighs] But I need to know...

20:58.132 --> 21:00.468
Are you ever going to be able
to get past this?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.096
Are you ever going to be able
to let this go?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.892
Because you need to.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.145
I mean, if this is ever...

21:11.353 --> 21:13.105
gonna work out, you...

21:13.314 --> 21:14.315
you need to.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.194
-I want to--
-Guys!

21:18.360 --> 21:21.947
Come on! 47 minutes till graduation.
You heard it from the horse's mouth.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.212
[Sam] <i>Shackleton's greatest legacy</i>
<i>was not reaching the South Pole...</i>

21:37.630 --> 21:42.009
I can't tell you what an impressive group
of young people this is.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.553
Well, you know, you raised them.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.931
[people laughing]

21:47.723 --> 21:50.893

Our boy's really growing up, huh?

21:59.902 --> 22:04.073
Hey. After this, you wanna go check
and see if the band room is unlocked?

-They've got a couch in there.
-Don't be gross.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.411
[woman coughs]

22:10.496 --> 22:12.540
But... text me later.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.293
I was supposed to hang with Izzie,
but maybe you can come over after.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.546
[teacher speaking on microphone]

22:21.715 --> 22:24.802
There you are. You're 19 minutes late,
which is unlike you.

Paige Hardaway.

Paige, I see you. You're right there.

-I can't do it.

-What?
-I can't do it.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.467
Why is your voice so hoarse? Are you sick?

You know, I really try
to see the best in people.

-I mean, "spaz"?

23:27.531 --> 23:29.199
"Freak"? "Weirdo"?

23:29.450 --> 23:32.453
I am ashamed to call myself an Owl.

23:32.870 --> 23:37.958
<i>No, you know what? You! All of you</i>
<i>should be ashamed to call yourselves Owls!</i>

Yeah, I'm sick.

Paige, please come up.
I simply cannot talk anymore.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.767
[people laughing]

23:54.892 --> 23:59.063
Well, you can't give your speech
like that, that would sound very annoying.

24:00.105 --> 24:04.068
[sobs] I know, I've just been preparing
for this since I was eight years old.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.739
And, I've worked so hard on it
and now no one's going to hear it.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.282
[whimpers]

24:12.534 --> 24:13.619
Yes, they will.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.121
I'll do it.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.791
What?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.126
I'll give your speech.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.339
Sam, you peed your pants
in the third grade.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.385
Well, that's a risk I'll have to take.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.470
I haven't had any water today.

[Sam] <i>Shackleton knew</i>
<i>some of his team wouldn't make it,</i>

24:37.559 --> 24:39.979
Okay, this is not Paige, but I'll take it.

24:40.062 --> 24:41.480
What's he doing?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.190
I think he's going up on the stage.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.984
Damn straight he's going up on the stage!

24:45.150 --> 24:46.527
Get it, Sammy! Rock out!

24:54.243 --> 24:56.537
-I should go up there. Should I?
-Please do not.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.833
-"Hi, I'm Paige Hardaway."
-[people chuckling]

25:02.334 --> 25:04.086
That's not true. I'm Sam Gardner.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.296
I'm just reading Paige's speech for her

25:06.380 --> 25:08.507
because her voice is scratchy
and annoying.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.050
-[people laughing]
-Um...

25:10.926 --> 25:14.805
"Thank you for coming,
and to my fellow graduates...

25:14.888 --> 25:15.973
congratulations.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.434
We did it. It's been a long road.

25:18.851 --> 25:23.063
[stuttering] I came to this school
as a girl and I blossomed into a woman."

25:23.272 --> 25:25.065
[people laughing]

25:25.190 --> 25:27.067
-So far, so good.
-Oh, Sam.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.029
-I love this so much.
-[laughs] Word.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.241
"A good friend once told me...

25:34.658 --> 25:36.243
penguins mate for life."

25:37.536 --> 25:38.454
Was that me?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.581
I think that was me.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.625
[Sam chuckles]

25:43.709 --> 25:48.881
"And, well, the friends I've made here are
like penguins because they're for life."

25:49.048 --> 25:50.507
That doesn't make any sense.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.718
[people laughing]

25:53.427 --> 25:57.973
"Our time at Newton High has been
nothing short of transformational.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.641
Dramatic pause."

26:00.726 --> 26:03.020
Am I supposed to pause dramatically?

26:03.145 --> 26:05.147
[people laughing]

[man coughing]

26:18.911 --> 26:21.455

26:21.663 --> 26:22.581
What?

26:22.664 --> 26:24.666
[people laughing]

26:25.000 --> 26:29.671
"Maya Angelou once said, 'If you find it
in your heart to care for somebody else,

26:29.755 --> 26:31.215
you will have succeeded.'

26:32.049 --> 26:35.135
-And by that metric..."
-Mom, are you crying?

26:35.219 --> 26:37.930
-"...I think we've already succeeded."
-Maybe.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.141
-This speech is ridiculous.
-I know.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.976
But he's doing it so well.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.147
"The future is unknown,
so I can't promise much..."

26:47.940 --> 26:49.024
Don't make it weird.

26:51.026 --> 26:55.322
"But I will promise you this:
I will never forget Newton High.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.826
Not when I graduate
at the top of my class at Bowdoin,

26:59.076 --> 27:02.204
or when I'm the first female
President of the United States.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.664
Hold for applause.''

27:17.177 --> 27:19.972
''I thought I was coming to Newton
for an education,

27:20.180 --> 27:21.890
but I got so much more than that.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.308
Friendship,

27:23.475 --> 27:24.434

27:24.601 --> 27:25.769
independence,

27:25.894 --> 27:26.812

27:27.563 --> 27:29.148

27:29.940 --> 27:32.609
Thank you all for being a part
of my epic journey.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.153
The future is female."

27:34.778 --> 27:36.155
I don't know what that means.

27:36.572 --> 27:37.781
I'm finished.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.492
[people cheering and applauding]

28:02.931 --> 28:05.058
-He did that so well.
-So good.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.352
That's my brother!

28:11.648 --> 28:12.482
Look...

28:12.983 --> 28:14.818
I think we need to talk about everything.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.737
-Can you do that?
-Yeah.

28:17.696 --> 28:21.533
I was thinking maybe tonight because
Sam has his senior lock-in thing,

28:21.617 --> 28:23.994
-and Casey's going out with Izzie.
-Okay.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.955
-I'll be there.
-Okay. Great.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.169
You know I babysit.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.379
Okay.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.135
Hey, Sam.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.930
There you are.
We're almost late for the lock-in.

28:43.013 --> 28:46.558
I packed and repacked my pajamas six times
because I didn't know what to do.

28:47.351 --> 28:48.310
Sam...

28:48.602 --> 28:51.438
you once told me
that you're not a champion of anything.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.857
But that's not true at all.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.568
You're a champion of being there for me.

28:57.694 --> 29:01.281
I mean, I can't believe
that you gave my speech for me today.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.158
How did you manage to do it?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.452
I've thought about that a lot.

29:05.786 --> 29:09.414
I was thinking about how I jumped
into the pool for you,

29:09.498 --> 29:11.375
and how I gave a speech for you,

29:11.500 --> 29:14.044
and how when I kissed Bailey Bennett,
it was nice.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.379
Really nice.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.549
But not as nice
as when I kissed you, and...

29:19.925 --> 29:24.263
I realized that I think the reason I gave
your speech is that I'm in love with you.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.767
[zipping bag]

29:30.811 --> 29:32.312
Well, should we go or what?

29:33.355 --> 29:34.189
Come on.

29:36.650 --> 29:37.901
[Doug] <i>I don't know what to do.</i>

29:40.445 --> 29:42.906
[stammers]
I'm trying to get past everything.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.410
I'm trying...

29:49.830 --> 29:50.789
to forgive.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.547
I want to, I...

30:00.632 --> 30:01.967
I really do.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.860
I just haven't...

30:20.819 --> 30:22.029
been able to do it.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.578
Do you want to come in and talk?

30:43.383 --> 30:45.302
I can't believe we drove four towns away

30:45.385 --> 30:48.430
just to find a 7-Eleven
that serves cotton candy Slurpees.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.182
I have no regrets.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.353
So guess what?

30:56.813 --> 30:58.023
I had sex again.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.317
With Evan?

31:00.650 --> 31:02.110
No, with myself.

31:02.611 --> 31:06.156
-Still counts, though, right?
-Shut up. [chuckles]

31:07.366 --> 31:08.867
Yeah, with Evan.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.703
I really love him.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.041
I know you do.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.128
It's just,
sometimes a thing feels, like...

31:22.839 --> 31:23.757
so right.

31:25.842 --> 31:26.760
You know?
