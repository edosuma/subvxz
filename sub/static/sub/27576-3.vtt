Previously, on "Heartland"...

00:02.150 --> 00:04.564
You said you were dating again,

00:04.631 --> 00:08.266
is that serious, or is it just casual?

00:08.368 --> 00:11.470
Well, I mean,
we're not putting labels on things.

00:11.571 --> 00:13.038
We're just gonna see how this goes.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.407
See how it goes, that's... that's good.

00:15.508 --> 00:17.320
Smart.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.178
- I'm movin' in.
- Movin' in where?

00:20.279 --> 00:22.981
Here. To Heartland.

00:23.182 --> 00:25.384
I just shouldn'tve
given you an ultimatum.

00:25.485 --> 00:28.083
Total fail, you know?

00:28.788 --> 00:31.623
Total fail.

00:31.724 --> 00:33.625
Yeah.

00:42.135 --> 00:44.738
I shouldn'tve driven away.

01:39.926 --> 01:42.494
Yay! Great job!

01:42.595 --> 01:44.062
There we go! You're doin' so good!

01:44.163 --> 01:46.097
Yay!

01:46.199 --> 01:48.266
Looks like someone's
having a fun morning!

01:48.367 --> 01:50.502
Oh, she's getting so good at riding.

01:50.603 --> 01:52.304
Was there every any doubt?

01:52.405 --> 01:54.139
Are you building something?

01:54.240 --> 01:56.942
- Yeah, maybe.
- Good...

01:57.043 --> 02:00.378
I just finished putting up a
shop over at Stumpy's place,

02:00.480 --> 02:02.914
and I got to thinkin'.

02:03.015 --> 02:06.084
Maybe we oughta build Lyndy a treehouse.

02:06.185 --> 02:07.953
Well,
don't you think she's a little young

02:08.054 --> 02:10.689
- for a treehouse?
- Treehouse?

02:10.789 --> 02:12.991
That's a fantastic idea. Count me in.

02:18.297 --> 02:19.631
Yes. Oh.

02:19.732 --> 02:22.667
All I'm asking for is a
little notice next time.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.770
I know. Okay. Have a great trip.

02:25.872 --> 02:27.873
Thanks for the heads up, Jen.

02:27.974 --> 02:30.475
She booked a horse yoga
retreat for one of her friends

02:30.576 --> 02:32.611
at the dude ranch this weekend!

02:32.712 --> 02:34.513
Horse yoga? Is that a real thing?

02:34.614 --> 02:36.448
Apparently, check it out.

02:36.549 --> 02:38.650
Oh my gosh, that's so weird.

02:38.751 --> 02:40.285
I just wish that she had told me

02:40.386 --> 02:41.753
before she went on vacation,

02:41.854 --> 02:44.155
because now I'm scrambling
to set everything up.

02:44.257 --> 02:45.824
Anyway,
if you're good here I've gotta run,

02:45.925 --> 02:48.360
I'm meeting this "friend" in like,
seven minutes.

02:48.461 --> 02:50.562
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:50.663 --> 02:52.531
As we come out of Shavasana,

02:52.632 --> 02:54.666
I wanna thank you for joining me

02:54.767 --> 02:57.569
in this beautiful practice today.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.604
Hands to the third eye.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.242
The light in me honours
the light in you.

03:04.343 --> 03:07.012
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

03:11.017 --> 03:13.318
Great work, guys.

03:13.419 --> 03:15.353
See you next week.

03:15.454 --> 03:16.922
Hi, Maya?

03:17.023 --> 03:18.690
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Lou.

03:18.791 --> 03:21.560
Oh hi, so great to meet you!

03:21.661 --> 03:23.261
And thank you so much for letting me use

03:23.362 --> 03:25.463
your absolutely stunning dude ranch.

03:25.565 --> 03:26.598
Oh, you've seen it?

03:26.699 --> 03:28.366
Yeah, Jen gave me a tour last week,

03:28.467 --> 03:31.403
and I was blown away,
what an amazing spot,

03:31.504 --> 03:33.538
and what an incredible
job you've done there.

03:33.639 --> 03:35.006
I mean, it's breathtaking.

03:35.107 --> 03:37.609
- Thank you.
- One thing, though.

03:37.710 --> 03:40.045
It looks like we'll have
to get our meals catered.

03:40.146 --> 03:41.413
Oh, Jen should've mentioned,

03:41.514 --> 03:43.615
we actually have a
pretty expansive menu.

03:43.716 --> 03:45.083
Yes, and she did.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.619
And I... I hate to be that girl,

03:47.720 --> 03:49.421
but I'm vegan,

03:49.522 --> 03:52.490
and most of the people
in class are as well.

03:52.592 --> 03:54.092
Well, we would be happy to stray away

03:54.193 --> 03:55.527
from our usual fare.

03:55.628 --> 03:57.729
Really? You could do that?

03:57.830 --> 03:59.764
I'll tell you what, why don't
you come by for dinner tonight,

03:59.865 --> 04:01.533
and I'll give you a taste
of the kind of meals

04:01.634 --> 04:04.436
- we could pull off.
- Oh, that would be great!

04:04.537 --> 04:06.271
I mean,
I would love to meet your whole family.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.273
Mitch has told me so
much about all of you.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.041
- Oh, you know Mitch?
- Yeah.

04:10.142 --> 04:11.376
Yeah, Jen didn't tell you?

04:11.477 --> 04:12.844
She's the one who introduced us;

04:12.945 --> 04:14.846
- he's my boyfriend.
- Bye Maya, thanks a lot!

04:14.947 --> 04:16.180
Bye, take care,

04:16.281 --> 04:18.083
- I'll see you next week.
- See ya!

05:01.794 --> 05:03.461
Well,
it's not enough I have to have to live

05:03.562 --> 05:05.030
under the same roof as Tim,

05:05.131 --> 05:07.832
now I have to build a
treehouse with him?!

05:07.933 --> 05:09.434
Oh, come on, Jack,
it won't be that bad.

05:11.137 --> 05:13.772
Well, look who it is.

05:13.873 --> 05:17.342
- Clint! Hey! How are you?
- Amy.

05:17.443 --> 05:18.576
Good to see you.

05:18.678 --> 05:20.311
I hear congratulations are in order.

05:20.413 --> 05:22.313
Yes, we had a baby girl, Lyndy.

05:22.415 --> 05:23.782
I just put her down for her nap.

05:23.883 --> 05:25.250
Aw, I'll have to meet her next time.

05:25.351 --> 05:26.384
- Clint, how are you?
- Hey.

05:26.485 --> 05:27.719
We're just about to build a treehouse.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.821
Oh! Jack.

05:29.922 --> 05:31.389
How you doin'? Things goin' well?

05:31.490 --> 05:33.692
Oh, great, you bet.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.493
But you didn't come all the way out here

05:35.594 --> 05:38.063
just to see how I was doing, did you?

05:38.164 --> 05:40.065
No, guilty as charged.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.933
I do have another favour to ask.

05:42.034 --> 05:43.501
Yeah, what can I do for you?

05:43.602 --> 05:46.371
You know, actually I came
here to see Ty this time.

05:47.573 --> 05:49.207
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.543
You know, I've got this new case, um...

05:51.644 --> 05:53.712
he's a little boy, Luke.

05:53.813 --> 05:55.947
And he's having some trouble at school.

05:56.048 --> 05:57.482
You know, getting into fights.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.818
- The last one got him suspended.
- Okay.

05:59.919 --> 06:02.087
See,
his mother says he seems fine at home,

06:02.188 --> 06:04.689
but the teachers tell a different story.

06:04.790 --> 06:07.826
Out of the blue he'll just
have these violent outbursts.

06:07.927 --> 06:09.194
Hmm.

06:09.295 --> 06:10.528
I just thought, you know,

06:10.629 --> 06:12.697
a couple of days around horses,
on a ranch

06:12.798 --> 06:14.432
might put him in a better headspace.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.435
- Well, when were you thinking?
- When would be good for you?

06:18.437 --> 06:20.105
Um, I don't know, we...

06:20.206 --> 06:22.407
- We're around all weekend.
- Oh, that'd be great,

06:22.508 --> 06:26.211
because I could drop him off
and pick him up both days.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.513
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

06:28.614 --> 06:30.248
Thank you, Ty.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.217
I know you're gonna
make a real difference.

06:36.422 --> 06:38.757
Hey, what's up?

06:38.858 --> 06:39.924
Oh, nothing.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.461
Except I just invited Maya for dinner.

06:43.562 --> 06:45.029
What? Why?

06:45.131 --> 06:46.731
Why didn't you tell me about her?

06:46.832 --> 06:49.000
I had no idea she was your girlfriend!

06:49.101 --> 06:50.201
I did.

06:50.302 --> 06:52.270
No,
you mentioned you were dating someone,

06:52.371 --> 06:54.239
you didn't tell me it was Jen's friend.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.573
Well, why would that matter?

06:55.674 --> 06:58.443
Because she just booked
a yoga retreat here,

06:58.544 --> 07:00.245
at my dude ranch.

07:00.346 --> 07:02.614
Really?

07:02.715 --> 07:05.116
Maya teaches so many
classes I can't keep up.

07:06.685 --> 07:09.287
But... if it made you feel awkward...

07:09.388 --> 07:12.157
Awkward? I didn't say that.

07:12.258 --> 07:15.760
Well,
why did you come all the way down here

07:15.861 --> 07:17.929
to make me feel like
I did something wrong?

07:18.030 --> 07:19.697
Because I didn't.

07:20.699 --> 07:23.101
- Did I?
- No, you didn't.

07:23.202 --> 07:25.236
You just...
you said we were gonna be honest

07:25.337 --> 07:27.839
about this kind of thing,
and I felt a little sideswiped,

07:27.940 --> 07:29.774
that's all, but you know what?

07:29.875 --> 07:31.442
It's gonna be great,
it's gonna be awesome.

07:31.544 --> 07:33.178
I'm gonna do horse yoga.

07:33.279 --> 07:35.280
So... there is that.

07:39.819 --> 07:41.119
I think that's the one.

07:41.220 --> 07:43.721
That?!
Come on, we can do better than that!

07:43.823 --> 07:45.757
- Oh...
- Oh! Hey, hold it.

07:45.858 --> 07:47.125
Take a look at this.

07:50.162 --> 07:51.196
Have a look at that!

07:51.297 --> 07:52.764
Okay, so where'd you get that?

07:52.865 --> 07:54.299
Doesn't matter. That's a beauty.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.134
- Well, I like this better.
- No craftsmanship.

07:56.235 --> 07:59.504
Okay, guys, guys,
hold on a second, all right?

07:59.605 --> 08:01.206
I've been reading these articles online

08:01.307 --> 08:03.208
about treehouses being too high,

08:03.309 --> 08:05.510
and kids falling out of them,
getting injured, I just...

08:05.611 --> 08:07.545
I think ours should be a
little closer to the ground.

08:07.646 --> 08:08.780
They call it a treehouse

08:08.881 --> 08:10.548
because it's supposed to be in a tree,
Ty.

08:10.649 --> 08:12.951
And it will be, just...
lower to the ground, I guess, so...

08:13.052 --> 08:14.953
Thank you.

08:15.054 --> 08:16.287
Ty is right, we gotta be safe.

08:16.388 --> 08:18.957
- All right.
- Fine.

08:19.058 --> 08:20.558
But we do this one.

08:21.594 --> 08:23.828
Fine, we'll do this one.

08:23.929 --> 08:26.898
Great. Any other
precautions you wanna take?

08:26.999 --> 08:29.561
Alarm system? Fire alarm?

08:29.668 --> 08:30.702
Padded walls?

08:30.803 --> 08:33.171
No, this is good. We'll do this.

08:33.272 --> 08:35.707
Good choice, I'll take the plans.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.942
Oh. Okay, well...

08:38.043 --> 08:39.544
I guess we're done?

08:40.613 --> 08:42.547
Here we go.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.749
So we have a chickpea falafel.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.117
- Wow.
- Hmm.

08:46.218 --> 08:48.253
A beet pesto pasta.

08:48.354 --> 08:49.821
Where's the meat?

08:49.922 --> 08:52.357
And this is a sweet and sour tofu,

08:52.458 --> 08:54.659
and a black bean quinoa buddha bowl.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.262
Wow, it all looks so delicious.

08:57.363 --> 08:58.796
Yeah, it sure does.

08:58.898 --> 09:02.533
I literally do not know where to begin.

09:02.635 --> 09:05.470
Thank you for being such
good sports about this.

09:05.571 --> 09:07.272
- This is actually really good.
- Oh, good.

09:07.373 --> 09:08.840
And tons of protein.

09:08.941 --> 09:11.476
You could add it in
to your training diet.

09:11.577 --> 09:12.710
I've heard you're a show jumper,

09:12.811 --> 09:14.279
and a pretty darn good one.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.181
Now let's see if I've
got this all straight

09:17.283 --> 09:19.050
about the rest of you.

09:19.151 --> 09:22.854
Now, I know you have this
magical connection with horses.

09:22.955 --> 09:27.156
And you save endangered
animals all around the world.

09:27.393 --> 09:29.827
You're the cattleman who
keeps this place running.

09:29.929 --> 09:32.830
And... you are the rodeo legend

09:32.932 --> 09:35.422
who started his own school.

09:36.635 --> 09:39.938
Well, it doesn't compare to
doing handstands on a horse.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.408
I know horse yoga sounds kinda crazy,

09:43.509 --> 09:46.978
but it combines two of the
most Zen things you can do.

09:47.079 --> 09:48.646
And I'm totally stoked

09:48.747 --> 09:50.782
I get to do it with my
own horse this weekend.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.884
Is this the first time that you two

09:52.985 --> 09:55.320
- have done yoga together?
- Yeah.

09:55.421 --> 09:57.956
Yeah,
it should be a great bonding experience.

09:58.057 --> 09:59.590
I mean,
he's been a little jealous lately

09:59.692 --> 10:01.793
now that he's not the
only man in my life.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.761
Um...

10:03.862 --> 10:06.331
Maya, I love your purse.

10:06.432 --> 10:08.800
Oh thanks, it's not a purse, actually.

10:08.901 --> 10:12.470
It's a gift bag with well,
gifts for all of you.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.872
You might think this is a little weird,

10:14.974 --> 10:18.977
but I believe in the
healing powers of gemstones.

10:20.045 --> 10:21.212
So I picked some out

10:21.313 --> 10:24.115
that I thought would be
helpful for each of you.

10:24.216 --> 10:26.584
Um, this is amethyst, isn't it?

10:26.685 --> 10:28.786
That's right, for tranquility.

10:28.887 --> 10:31.923
I know how stressed out busy
people like yourself can get.

10:32.992 --> 10:34.892
Oh... thank you.

10:34.994 --> 10:37.595
Well, Maya, I use this.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.965
I got this in Mongolia.
Have you ever been there?

10:41.066 --> 10:43.134
No, I haven't.

10:43.235 --> 10:45.036
A Shaman gave it to me.

10:45.137 --> 10:47.739
Wow, that is so cool.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.646
Ah...

10:55.748 --> 10:57.582
You mind giving us a hand here?

10:58.751 --> 11:00.818
I'm setting up my work area here.

11:00.919 --> 11:02.787
Your work area?

11:02.888 --> 11:04.856
Well, I think I'm better with
the tools at this point, right?

11:04.957 --> 11:06.190
No, you're not!

11:06.291 --> 11:07.792
Okay, guys!

11:07.893 --> 11:09.527
You'll both get a chance
to play with the toys.

11:09.628 --> 11:12.130
Relax.

11:12.231 --> 11:14.032
All right...

11:14.133 --> 11:15.500
Okay,

11:16.502 --> 11:18.069
this is probably Clint.

11:18.170 --> 11:21.072
Okay, I've gotta go meet
that kid in a few minutes.

11:21.173 --> 11:22.774
So play nice, you two!

11:27.713 --> 11:29.981
I know you miss Lisa,
but it's not my fault she's gone,

11:30.082 --> 11:31.416
so don't take it out on me.

11:31.517 --> 11:33.851
Yeah,
you moving in to my house doesn't help.

11:33.952 --> 11:36.120
Well, it's temporary.

11:37.523 --> 11:39.490
Hey,
Amy thought these three were the best.

11:39.591 --> 11:41.426
Um, I'm gonna take this guy,
can you grab the other two?

11:41.527 --> 11:43.728
Yeah, sure.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.067
Excuse me,

11:49.168 --> 11:51.736
are you the Georgie Fleming-Morris?

11:53.639 --> 11:56.207
Can I get an autograph please?

11:56.308 --> 11:57.775
What are you doing here?

11:57.876 --> 12:00.078
My Mom said that I had
to do some odd jobs

12:00.179 --> 12:01.813
around the dude ranch.

12:02.981 --> 12:04.315
You cool with that?

12:04.416 --> 12:06.918
'Cause like,
we haven't seen each other in a while.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.654
And you're like, a huge superstar now.

12:09.755 --> 12:11.422
Put that thing away.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.758
I've gotta get these
horses ready for some yoga.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.226
Oh yeah, my Mom told me about that,

12:15.327 --> 12:16.661
that sounds hilarious.

12:16.762 --> 12:18.663
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

12:18.764 --> 12:20.932
Okay, bud.

12:24.636 --> 12:26.571
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

12:29.441 --> 12:31.042
Hey, I'd like you to meet Luke.

12:32.344 --> 12:34.045
- Hey, Luke.
- Luke, this is Ty.

12:34.146 --> 12:35.780
This is Amy, I told you about them.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.715
Hey.

12:37.816 --> 12:40.685
You know, I actually brought Ty out here

12:40.786 --> 12:42.353
when he was a little bit older than you.

12:42.454 --> 12:43.821
He liked it so much he never left.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.926
This guy here is my horse, Spartan.

12:49.027 --> 12:51.562
He's pretty special to me.

12:51.663 --> 12:53.564
And this one's Phoenix.

12:53.665 --> 12:55.500
He's an excellent jumper.

12:55.601 --> 12:57.135
And the one beside him is Trouble,

12:57.236 --> 12:59.270
because when he get here, well...

12:59.371 --> 13:01.973
he was trouble.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.975
Do you wanna take one for a ride?

13:04.076 --> 13:05.409
I don't know how.

13:05.511 --> 13:06.744
Oh, that's okay,

13:06.845 --> 13:08.513
you should've seen Ty when he got here.

13:08.614 --> 13:10.515
- Hey, come on now.
- I'm serious!

13:10.616 --> 13:13.985
He had no idea how to ride,
and now he has his own horse.

13:14.086 --> 13:16.254
This guy here, Harley.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.590
It's my Mom.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.995
- Hi, Mom.
- Hmm.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.463
Well, he's not what I expected.

13:25.564 --> 13:28.432
And what exactly were you expecting?

13:28.534 --> 13:30.001
I don't know, I guess like,

13:30.102 --> 13:31.969
rougher, maybe a bit of attitude?

13:32.070 --> 13:34.472
- How are you?
- He's just so quiet.

13:34.573 --> 13:37.441
Mm, well, just give it some time.

13:37.543 --> 13:38.576
All right.

13:38.677 --> 13:40.611
I need to head over to the dude ranch

13:40.712 --> 13:43.181
to do that yoga thing.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.918
Do you think maybe Luke could
help you build the treehouse?

13:48.554 --> 13:49.654
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

13:49.755 --> 13:51.856
- You have fun.
- You too.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.658
Thanks.

13:55.394 --> 13:56.761
Hey Amy, you made it.

13:56.862 --> 13:59.030
Yep, I'm here.

14:01.066 --> 14:02.700
What's with the extra horse?

14:02.801 --> 14:05.169
That one's for Mitch.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.671
Excuse me?

14:06.772 --> 14:08.673
Come on, do this with us.

14:08.774 --> 14:11.809
- Uh, are you serious?
- You'll be great, cowboy.

14:14.012 --> 14:15.680
Ah, all right, okay, okay.

14:15.781 --> 14:18.449
Let's start with a few
movements to warm up.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.151
And I want you to...

14:20.252 --> 14:23.087
lengthen your spine, palms upward.

14:24.256 --> 14:27.925
Take a deep breath as you raise
your arms above your head,

14:28.026 --> 14:30.361
for a nice big stretch...

14:30.462 --> 14:32.330
Whoops!

14:32.431 --> 14:34.198
Where are you going, Warrior?

14:34.299 --> 14:36.267
Whoa! No big deal.

14:36.368 --> 14:38.269
If your horse wants to move,
don't stress.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.538
Just continue breathing

14:40.639 --> 14:42.139
as you check in with him,

14:42.241 --> 14:44.275
make sure he's all good.

14:44.376 --> 14:46.344
Let's try this again.

14:46.445 --> 14:49.180
So I want you to put your
palms on your horse's back,

14:49.281 --> 14:52.383
and you're gonna bring
your knees back and up,

14:52.484 --> 14:54.819
just like that, and inhale...

14:54.920 --> 14:56.621
Aaah!
Oh! Oh!

14:56.722 --> 14:58.823
Maya! Oh! You okay?

14:58.924 --> 15:00.825
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

15:00.926 --> 15:02.226
He seems a little high strung.

15:02.327 --> 15:03.761
I know, I-I don't know why.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.264
I take him on a trail
ride almost every day.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.599
How long have you had him? Hey...

15:08.700 --> 15:11.035
I saw him about a year
ago at an auction,

15:11.136 --> 15:12.870
and no one wanted him
'cause he's a mustang.

15:12.971 --> 15:14.905
But I-I loved his name,
and I just had to save him.

15:15.007 --> 15:16.907
And I know he can do this,

15:17.009 --> 15:19.543
and I really wanna
experience it together.

15:19.645 --> 15:22.046
He never acts out on trail rides,
I mean...

15:22.147 --> 15:25.082
Have you ridden him
without a saddle before?

15:25.183 --> 15:26.651
No.

15:26.752 --> 15:28.653
Okay, well, that could be it.

15:28.754 --> 15:31.088
He just might not be
comfortable without one.

15:31.189 --> 15:32.723
Well, what do you think, Amy?

15:32.824 --> 15:36.060
Do you think you could
do some work on him?

15:36.161 --> 15:37.762
Oh, that would be amazing.

15:37.863 --> 15:39.430
It would mean so much to me.

15:39.531 --> 15:41.098
Well, uh...

15:41.199 --> 15:43.301
I'll have to miss out on yoga, but uh,

15:43.402 --> 15:46.404
I could probably have him ready
for you to use the second day.

15:46.505 --> 15:48.472
Oh my God, that-I would be so grateful,
thank you!

15:48.573 --> 15:49.974
Yeah, oh-oh.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.677
Okay!

15:52.778 --> 15:55.680
Hey, guys!
I found us a new set of hands.

15:55.781 --> 15:57.615
You know, if this thing was
any closer to the ground,

15:57.716 --> 16:00.217
it wouldn't officially be a treehouse.

16:00.319 --> 16:02.420
This looks great. This is Luke.

16:02.521 --> 16:03.988
Well, it's nice to meet you, Luke.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.557
I'm Jack. Welcome to the party.

16:07.793 --> 16:09.960
Hello, little buddy.

16:10.062 --> 16:11.562
I'm Tim.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.369
Hey, uh,
here's something you might wanna do.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.704
Yeah.

16:19.805 --> 16:22.373
I assembled all the
parts for a birdhouse...

16:22.474 --> 16:23.708
Oh.

16:23.809 --> 16:25.910
That I want to end up
looking like our treehouse.

16:26.011 --> 16:28.379
So maybe you wanna try to assemble that,

16:28.480 --> 16:30.514
put it together, what do you think?

16:30.615 --> 16:33.017
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.

16:34.419 --> 16:37.154
And uh...
what have we got here, let's see.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.624
These look like the roof panels.

16:40.726 --> 16:42.827
What do you think,
do they probably go in here?

16:42.928 --> 16:44.662
Like that?

16:44.763 --> 16:46.397
I guess so.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.366
Think you can manage?

16:48.467 --> 16:50.735
Oh yeah, we'll figure it out.

16:50.836 --> 16:52.169
Right, Luke?

16:53.939 --> 16:55.406
- Yeah, yeah, apparently.
- Oh, really?

16:55.507 --> 16:58.008
- Oh she is, yeah.
- Yeah, obviously.

17:01.513 --> 17:03.080
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

17:03.181 --> 17:05.849
Yes, horse yoga is... ridiculous.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.054
Okay, yeah, that too.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.356
But I'm talking about
what's going on over there.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.258
Maya is totally crushing.

17:14.358 --> 17:16.060
Oh, really?

17:16.161 --> 17:18.529
Yeah, she's fawning all over Mitch.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.232
And the worst part is,
he doesn't even seem to mind.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.267
I wonder if my Mom's noticed.

17:30.642 --> 17:32.810
How's it goin', Luke?

17:32.911 --> 17:34.512
Okay.

17:36.548 --> 17:38.783
You'd do a lot better if you
weren't starin' at your phone.

17:40.886 --> 17:42.353
Come on, kid!

17:42.454 --> 17:44.288
This is the great outdoors,
Mother Nature,

17:44.389 --> 17:46.090
it's beautiful.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.691
You can play games later.

17:47.793 --> 17:49.827
I'm not playing a game.

17:49.928 --> 17:51.429
I'm just texting my Mom.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.098
Well, you can do that later, too.

17:54.199 --> 17:57.368
You know, when I was a kid,
we'd spend all day outside.

17:57.469 --> 17:58.903
Never talk to our parents once.

17:59.004 --> 18:01.872
- All right, Tim.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

18:01.973 --> 18:03.941
Times have changed, right?

18:06.278 --> 18:08.012
I'll tell you what;
I'll hang on to this while you build.

18:08.113 --> 18:09.447
Hey! Hey! Give that back!

18:09.548 --> 18:13.017
I'll give it back after
you make a little progress.

18:13.118 --> 18:14.618
Aaah!

18:14.719 --> 18:15.753
Whoa, what are you doing?

18:15.854 --> 18:17.788
Whoa, hey! Whoa! Whoa!

18:17.889 --> 18:20.157
Ah! Hey! Give me that.

18:20.258 --> 18:21.959
What's goin' on with you?

18:24.663 --> 18:26.363
Luke!

18:35.502 --> 18:38.504
Luke, can you please stop?

18:39.673 --> 18:41.440
I'm serious, Luke!

18:41.541 --> 18:43.542
All right, that's far enough, okay?!

18:43.643 --> 18:45.110
Aah! Luke!

18:45.211 --> 18:47.413
Stop!

18:55.855 --> 18:58.490
Listen, I'm sorry for yelling.

18:59.492 --> 19:00.926
All right?

19:02.929 --> 19:06.231
It's just,
Clint expects me to keep you safe.

19:06.332 --> 19:09.268
And that includes not letting
you run off into the woods.

19:14.607 --> 19:16.436
What happened back there?

19:19.479 --> 19:21.146
I know Tim shouldn'tve taken your phone.

19:23.850 --> 19:26.285
But why'd you destroy the birdhouse?

19:29.622 --> 19:31.490
I wanna go.

19:31.591 --> 19:33.625
Can you call Clint?

19:36.696 --> 19:38.731
Let's just do something different, okay?

19:38.832 --> 19:41.400
You wanna check out my motorcycle?

19:45.605 --> 19:47.506
Okay, well...

19:47.607 --> 19:49.408
Let's go feed the horses then, okay?

19:51.444 --> 19:53.412
Can you just call Clint?

19:58.418 --> 20:00.252
All right.

20:01.855 --> 20:03.555
Come on.

20:11.798 --> 20:13.632
All right, thanks.
See you tomorrow, Clint.

20:13.733 --> 20:15.968
Okay, bye.

20:16.069 --> 20:17.469
Guess who's comin' back?

20:17.570 --> 20:19.772
Well, then things didn't
go as bad as you thought.

20:19.873 --> 20:22.341
Uh no, Luke's Mom doesn't
have any childcare lined up.

20:22.442 --> 20:24.443
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:26.212 --> 20:28.313
I kinda lost it on him.

20:28.414 --> 20:29.915
I got rattled, and...

20:31.751 --> 20:34.686
You guys are still
figuring each other out.

20:34.788 --> 20:36.722
Well,
your Dad shouldn'tve been teasing him.

20:36.823 --> 20:38.949
The guy's just so intense, though.

20:39.359 --> 20:42.528
I have to find a way to
keep those two apart.

20:42.629 --> 20:44.663
Maybe I can help with that.

20:50.236 --> 20:53.138
Well, from what I can tell,
he's perfectly healthy.

20:53.239 --> 20:55.073
No back issues, or anything like that.

20:55.175 --> 20:56.375
Okay, well, that's good.

20:56.476 --> 20:57.943
I just really wanted to rule that out.

20:59.913 --> 21:00.746
- Hey!
- Hey.

21:00.847 --> 21:02.514
A glorious day, isn't it?

21:04.851 --> 21:06.952
There he is.

21:07.053 --> 21:08.187
Hey, Luke.

21:08.288 --> 21:10.255
Do you wanna help me put Warrior away?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.957
Okay.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.927
Come on.

21:17.197 --> 21:18.964
So, I heard yesterday was pretty rough.

21:19.065 --> 21:20.966
- Are you good?
- Oh yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

21:21.067 --> 21:22.301
It's just, you know.

21:22.402 --> 21:24.102
Finding my way.

21:24.204 --> 21:25.971
Do you think you can give
me any more background

21:26.072 --> 21:27.306
on this kid?

21:27.407 --> 21:29.374
What would you like to know?

21:29.475 --> 21:31.443
Well, let's start with those fights.

21:31.544 --> 21:34.313
You said he got suspended for one?

21:34.414 --> 21:36.415
Well, I'm a little murky
on how that one started,

21:36.516 --> 21:39.484
But it didn't end well,
the other kid lost a few teeth.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.521
Jeez.

21:42.622 --> 21:45.057
He's a bit of a live wire.

21:45.158 --> 21:47.226
Yeah.

21:47.327 --> 21:49.228
But so were you.

21:54.701 --> 21:56.768
See ya, Clint.

21:56.870 --> 21:59.338
See you later, Luke.

22:01.774 --> 22:04.676
Little buddy, you're back.

22:04.777 --> 22:06.044
Fresh start, huh?

22:06.145 --> 22:08.146
I'll tell you what;
I'll stay out of your little face,

22:08.248 --> 22:09.882
if you stay off your phone.

22:09.983 --> 22:12.451
Dad, actually, I could really
use your help with this horse.

22:12.552 --> 22:14.686
Maybe the can get a
head start without you?

22:14.787 --> 22:16.021
I'm kinda the foreman, so.

22:16.122 --> 22:17.589
Well, it-this won't take long.

22:17.690 --> 22:18.991
- Amy!
- Dad.

22:19.092 --> 22:20.259
Hey Luke, come on, let's go.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.995
Okay. All right.

22:23.096 --> 22:24.796
- Hey, Ty?
- Yeah?

22:24.898 --> 22:26.598
Tell Jack none of the roll-out roofing,
okay?

22:26.699 --> 22:28.166
I want cedar shakes.

22:28.268 --> 22:29.601
Those are shingles!

22:29.702 --> 22:31.570
Three-quarter overlap on the siding!

22:31.671 --> 22:33.138
You'll learn to tune him out.

22:43.116 --> 22:45.517
Make sure you keep breathing...

22:45.618 --> 22:47.452
as you get into your next pose.

22:49.956 --> 22:51.957
Hey there, cowboy.

22:52.058 --> 22:54.826
You sure you don't wanna hop on a horse,
and join us?

22:54.928 --> 22:57.362
Um, no.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.165
No, I'm-I'm fine right here.

23:01.601 --> 23:04.703
Yoga improves every part of your life,
you know.

23:06.906 --> 23:09.540
And I mean every part.

23:09.709 --> 23:11.643
- Ah-oof!
- Are you okay?

23:11.744 --> 23:14.646
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

23:15.949 --> 23:20.234
Okay,
let's lay flat on our horse's backs

23:20.386 --> 23:23.622
as we go into Shavasana.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.528
Become one with your horse.

23:29.629 --> 23:33.498
With nature,
and the entire universe around us.

23:33.599 --> 23:36.435
And may
the force be with you.

23:39.939 --> 23:41.907
Easy... whoa, whoa!

23:42.008 --> 23:43.842
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

23:43.943 --> 23:45.711
Easy, easy.

23:45.812 --> 23:47.846
Warrior, hey.

23:47.947 --> 23:49.848
It's not gonna hurt you.

23:49.949 --> 23:52.417
Come here.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.519
Well, let's just try it again.

23:54.620 --> 23:57.289
You're all right, I'm right here.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.758
Hooo...

24:01.461 --> 24:03.228
It's okay, Warrior.

24:04.230 --> 24:06.264
It's not gonna hurt you, I'm right here.

24:07.667 --> 24:09.368
Good job.

24:10.436 --> 24:13.939
Easy... easy. There you go, boy.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.474
- There we go.
- There, see?

24:15.575 --> 24:18.243
I'm right here, I'm right with you.

24:19.245 --> 24:20.779
All right.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.447
Let's try to walk.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.017
You're okay.

24:25.118 --> 24:27.486
See?

24:27.587 --> 24:29.721
It feels a little different
than a saddle, doesn't it?

24:29.822 --> 24:31.490
You're okay, step up.

24:32.825 --> 24:34.826
Yeah... good job, buddy.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.164
There! You did so good!

24:40.533 --> 24:41.900
Good!

24:42.001 --> 24:44.169
Okay, my work's done here.

24:44.270 --> 24:46.905
Whoa! Hold on, Dad!

24:47.006 --> 24:49.141
I still need your help,
I have to get on him bareback.

24:55.548 --> 24:57.382
Oh wow.

24:57.483 --> 24:58.617
Nice job, Luke.

24:58.718 --> 25:00.185
You're almost done.

25:02.355 --> 25:03.622
Luke?

25:03.723 --> 25:05.724
The front door's too big.

25:05.825 --> 25:07.125
It has to be smaller for the bird,

25:07.226 --> 25:09.728
to keep her safe.

25:09.829 --> 25:11.296
You're right.

25:11.397 --> 25:13.999
We don't want other animals gettin'
in there.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.701
Let's change it.

25:20.173 --> 25:23.108
Uh, why are there rocks in Maya's bed?

25:23.209 --> 25:24.543
Oh, those are gemstones.

25:24.644 --> 25:26.278
They help with relaxation or something.

25:26.379 --> 25:28.113
She really believes they work.

25:28.214 --> 25:29.681
Oh yeah, of course she does.

25:34.253 --> 25:36.021
Um, no! Don't read her texts.

25:36.122 --> 25:38.056
It's from Mitch.

25:39.592 --> 25:40.859
"Dinner again tonight?"

25:40.960 --> 25:42.727
With a kissy-face emoji?!

25:43.729 --> 25:45.964
Whoa.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.334
. Hi.
- Hey...

25:49.435 --> 25:52.003
- We're just cleaning.
- Great, thanks.

25:52.105 --> 25:53.839
Don't mind me, I just forgot something.

25:53.940 --> 25:54.906
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah...

25:55.007 --> 25:56.875
Well, we're done anyway, so...

25:56.976 --> 25:58.110
- Right, bye.
- Okay.

25:58.211 --> 25:59.578
- Thank you, bye.
- Bye.

25:59.679 --> 26:01.780
- Okay, have a good day.
- You, too.

26:11.490 --> 26:12.757
- Good boy.
- Easy...

26:12.858 --> 26:15.493
There we go.

26:15.594 --> 26:18.183
Oh, thanks, Dad,
that'll help distract him.

26:18.312 --> 26:20.164
That's it, that's it.

26:20.266 --> 26:23.301
- Okay?
- Hmm... good boy.

26:23.402 --> 26:26.237
All right, let's see how this works.

26:27.906 --> 26:30.174
Good boy!

26:30.276 --> 26:32.176
Would you look at that!

26:32.278 --> 26:34.512
Okay, that's good, fantastic!

26:36.282 --> 26:37.749
Okay, so you're done with me.

26:37.850 --> 26:39.651
Whoa, hold on, Dad, I...

26:39.752 --> 26:40.785
I still need your help!

26:40.886 --> 26:42.820
Amy, I know what you're doin', okay?

26:42.921 --> 26:44.622
And I'm not gonna go
over and bother the kid,

26:44.723 --> 26:45.857
I've just gotta get out of here.

26:45.958 --> 26:48.092
You have been chomping
at the bit all morning.

26:48.193 --> 26:50.094
Like, what is up with you,
and this treehouse?

26:50.195 --> 26:51.863
Those guys don't know
what they're doin'.

26:51.964 --> 26:53.398
Right...

26:53.499 --> 26:56.968
and you've built so many treehouses,
you're the expert?

26:57.069 --> 26:59.003
Come on. Like, how many
treehouses have you built?

26:59.104 --> 27:00.271
That's the point, Amy!

27:00.372 --> 27:02.774
Okay? Take a look at this.

27:05.744 --> 27:07.979
I pulled this out of a
magazine 20-years-ago.

27:09.882 --> 27:12.317
I was gonna build that for
you and your sister, Lou.

27:13.452 --> 27:16.454
And then I got racked up, and...

27:16.555 --> 27:18.656
I never got around to it.

27:18.757 --> 27:20.358
And I know, it's a small little thing

27:20.459 --> 27:21.693
compared to all my other regrets,

27:21.794 --> 27:25.997
but this is one I got
a chance to get back.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.434
Lyndy's gonna love it.

27:30.569 --> 27:33.404
You go,
I think I know what I need to do here.

27:43.248 --> 27:45.116
Nice job.

27:46.352 --> 27:48.252
Is that how the front
door is supposed to look?

27:48.354 --> 27:50.488
Um, we just had to change it a bit,

27:50.589 --> 27:52.390
just to keep the birds safe.

27:52.491 --> 27:54.492
Right, that's... that's a good idea.

27:54.593 --> 27:57.095
- Yeah.
- That's smart, Luke.

27:58.163 --> 27:59.697
Good work.

28:23.322 --> 28:25.256
Here you go, do you want a bite?

28:25.357 --> 28:27.859
That's a good girl,
do you want some more?

28:27.960 --> 28:29.927
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

28:30.963 --> 28:34.705
Um, so I did something really stupid.

28:35.067 --> 28:37.024
What happened?

28:37.469 --> 28:40.104
So we were cleaning Maya's
room like you asked us to,

28:40.205 --> 28:42.306
and then her phone was out,

28:42.408 --> 28:44.809
and she got a text message, and...

28:46.879 --> 28:49.580
I kind of read it.

28:49.681 --> 28:51.516
You mean, by accident?

28:51.617 --> 28:53.718
No.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.586
I don't-I don't understand, Georgie.

28:55.687 --> 28:59.390
Why would you read a
guest's private message?

28:59.892 --> 29:02.128
It was from Mitch.

29:02.561 --> 29:04.862
Oh.

29:04.963 --> 29:07.298
What did... what did it say?

29:07.399 --> 29:10.824
Um, nothing much really, but...

29:11.103 --> 29:12.804
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

29:12.905 --> 29:16.240
but I think they're dating,
or something.

29:17.543 --> 29:20.712
It's okay honey, I know.

29:20.913 --> 29:22.313
What?

29:22.414 --> 29:24.549
I probably should've said
something to you earlier,

29:24.650 --> 29:27.885
but honestly, it's no big deal.

29:27.986 --> 29:29.353
- Really?
- Yeah!

29:29.455 --> 29:30.988
I'm cool with it.

29:31.089 --> 29:33.558
Mitch and I are friends, and...

29:33.659 --> 29:35.426
I'm happy for him.

29:35.527 --> 29:39.280
Okay, um, so here's the bigger problem.

29:39.998 --> 29:43.467
I didn't just read her text.

29:44.102 --> 29:48.105
I also accidentally took
her phone from her room.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.647
Oh... oh!

29:56.748 --> 29:58.916
I'm so sorry,
I-I don't know what to say.

29:59.017 --> 30:00.384
Hey, it's not big deal.

30:00.486 --> 30:02.053
I shouldn'tve left it on the bed,

30:02.154 --> 30:04.689
It probably got tangled
up in the dirty linens.

30:05.691 --> 30:07.492
Yeah.

30:07.593 --> 30:10.394
Anyway, has everything been okay so far,
otherwise?

30:10.496 --> 30:11.963
Oh, are you kidding?

30:12.064 --> 30:13.865
I mean, the retreat has been magical.

30:13.966 --> 30:16.000
This place is perfect.

30:16.101 --> 30:17.468
And you've been amazing.

30:17.569 --> 30:18.970
Oh, thank you.

30:19.071 --> 30:21.138
You know, I'm just happy you're happy.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.809
And I'm so glad there has been
zero awkwardness between us.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.478
Yeah, I mean,
why would things be awkward?

30:27.579 --> 30:30.481
Exactly! You know,
I really respect that about you.

30:30.582 --> 30:33.150
You're just so secure.

30:33.252 --> 30:34.552
Not everyone would be okay

30:34.653 --> 30:36.988
dealing with their boyfriend's ex.

30:40.993 --> 30:43.427
You dated Mitch?

30:43.529 --> 30:46.531
Y-yeah. A while ago.

30:47.799 --> 30:48.866
It's not...

30:48.967 --> 30:53.493
Uh, why, did he not say anything to you?

30:54.640 --> 30:57.742
No. No, he didn't.

30:59.444 --> 31:01.078
Huh.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.082
Thanks for all your help out there.

31:05.183 --> 31:08.326
At this pace,
we're gonna be done pretty soon.

31:10.556 --> 31:12.123
Here you go.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.095
Yeah, just pop that off,
and then, push the button.

31:18.196 --> 31:19.830
There you go.

31:21.567 --> 31:23.568
Ah...

31:24.836 --> 31:27.939
So I was talking to Clint,
and he was saying that uh,

31:28.040 --> 31:30.808
you had a little trouble at school.

31:30.909 --> 31:33.010
With a-maybe a fight, or something?

31:34.980 --> 31:37.615
I didn't mean to hurt him.

31:37.716 --> 31:39.584
Hmm. What happened?

31:40.586 --> 31:42.820
They kept saying things.

31:42.921 --> 31:44.589
Especially him.

31:46.191 --> 31:47.592
What kind of things?

31:49.127 --> 31:50.494
About my Mom.

31:51.697 --> 31:53.364
Stuff that isn't true.

31:55.167 --> 31:58.102
I know what it feels like to
wanna protect someone you love.

31:58.203 --> 31:59.737
You get this feeling inside,

31:59.838 --> 32:02.173
like in your gut, it's like a fire,

32:02.274 --> 32:03.741
and if feels like it's gonna burn you up

32:03.842 --> 32:06.911
if you don't do something about it,
so you lash out.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.746
That's what I did.

32:08.847 --> 32:11.482
I got in a lot of
fights when I was a kid.

32:11.583 --> 32:14.608
I'd get so mad it felt
like I was gonna explode.

32:19.524 --> 32:21.308
You know what I mean?

32:21.627 --> 32:23.628
How do you stop feeling like that?

32:26.064 --> 32:28.399
Well, now I just breathe.

32:29.534 --> 32:31.068
Just in and out.

32:31.169 --> 32:33.804
Just breathe a few times,

32:33.905 --> 32:36.440
and eventually the anger just...

32:36.541 --> 32:39.076
drains out of me.

32:40.245 --> 32:42.279
How long does it take?

32:44.549 --> 32:46.445
A few minutes.

32:48.186 --> 32:50.221
And sometimes a few years.

32:50.322 --> 32:52.089
But it's better than acting out.

32:53.258 --> 32:55.526
And no one's ever been
arrested for breathing before.

33:01.733 --> 33:03.334
Please, just leave!

33:03.435 --> 33:04.835
I don't wanna talk about this anymore!

33:04.936 --> 33:06.437
Look, can we just talk about this?

33:06.538 --> 33:07.571
- Just leave!
- No, stop!

33:07.673 --> 33:09.573
Can we talk about this?
It's not a big deal!

33:09.675 --> 33:11.342
Then why were you hiding it from me?!

33:11.443 --> 33:12.576
You think I would've had my retreat here

33:12.678 --> 33:14.478
if I knew Lou was your ex-girlfriend?!

33:14.579 --> 33:16.247
I mean, I feel ridiculous!

33:16.348 --> 33:18.215
- Calm down.
- Calm down? Are you...

33:18.316 --> 33:20.151
I need to meditate, okay?!

33:20.252 --> 33:22.386
Just leave me alone!

33:28.126 --> 33:30.494
Oh my God...

33:30.595 --> 33:31.862
well, you don't have to worry

33:31.963 --> 33:33.531
about Mitch and Maya anymore, huh?

33:36.301 --> 33:38.302
Wow.

33:43.008 --> 33:44.675
Mitch, I'm so sorry.

33:44.776 --> 33:47.927
I had no idea she didn't know.

33:48.847 --> 33:50.481
It's not your fault.

33:50.582 --> 33:52.951
It's... it's my fault.

33:53.118 --> 33:56.520
I should've told her about us,
and I didn't.

33:56.621 --> 33:58.155
Yeah, so...

33:59.157 --> 34:00.624
why didn't you?

34:00.726 --> 34:03.094
I-I don't know, I guess...

34:03.195 --> 34:07.098
I guess I just have to
get better at-at this.

34:07.199 --> 34:09.500
Ugh!

34:09.601 --> 34:10.967
Am I crazy?

34:11.069 --> 34:12.737
This whole Maya thing?

34:12.838 --> 34:14.839
- In what way?
- Oh...

34:14.940 --> 34:17.241
she's a yogi, I'm a cowboy.

34:17.342 --> 34:20.024
She's city, I'm country.

34:20.312 --> 34:22.446
She believes in the power of gemstones,

34:22.547 --> 34:25.916
and I don't, because that's... stupid.

34:26.016 --> 34:27.717
I-she is a vegan.

34:27.819 --> 34:30.054
She'll tell you it a 100 times.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.789
And not only do I like a steak,

34:31.889 --> 34:33.991
I'm-I'm a cattle rancher!

34:35.193 --> 34:37.527
It doesn't make sense.

34:41.900 --> 34:45.129
And I mean, despite all of that...

34:46.737 --> 34:48.438
I like her.

34:49.507 --> 34:51.007
I...

34:51.667 --> 34:53.696
really like her.

34:56.547 --> 34:58.282
What do you think, Lou?

34:59.351 --> 35:01.118
I think that when two
people belong together,

35:01.219 --> 35:02.853
it doesn't really matter
what their differences are.

35:02.954 --> 35:07.291
You know, life has a way
of working that stuff out.

35:07.392 --> 35:09.293
If you don't let every
meaningless little detail

35:09.394 --> 35:11.128
get in the way.

35:12.330 --> 35:16.674
Maybe sometimes we get so far
up inside our own heads we...

35:17.102 --> 35:19.403
miss out on what the heart really wants.

35:23.809 --> 35:26.577
Hmm.

35:26.678 --> 35:29.107
I hear what you're saying.

35:30.148 --> 35:31.515
Thanks.

35:34.786 --> 35:37.288
No problem.

35:50.033 --> 35:53.620
Hey, you ready to see this, Lyndy?

35:57.207 --> 35:59.775
Oh, Lyndy!

36:00.777 --> 36:02.744
It's amazing, you guys!

36:02.845 --> 36:05.981
And you should see how
much room there is inside.

36:06.082 --> 36:08.817
Your Grandpa, Tim,
could even sleep in there.

36:08.918 --> 36:11.486
No way, kids only, right, Lyndy?

36:11.588 --> 36:12.988
Oh, and look!

36:13.089 --> 36:15.290
Look at the little birdhouse!

36:15.391 --> 36:17.960
Isn't that cute? For birds.

36:18.061 --> 36:20.195
Yeah, all thanks to Luke right here.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.131
House.

36:23.233 --> 36:25.133
Do you wanna go see the house?

36:25.235 --> 36:26.802
Yeah.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.439
Maya, please!

36:30.540 --> 36:32.441
Just open the door.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.110
I just...

36:35.211 --> 36:37.579
I just wanna talk to you.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.525
Okay, I'm listening.

36:52.795 --> 36:55.364
Um...

36:55.465 --> 36:57.633
I really, I just have one thing...

36:57.734 --> 36:59.034
I wanna say to you.

36:59.135 --> 37:01.436
Yeah?

37:01.537 --> 37:03.805
Um...

37:07.610 --> 37:09.745
I just wanna tell you that...

37:12.448 --> 37:14.116
I love you.

37:17.620 --> 37:20.055
Oh, Mitch.

37:20.156 --> 37:22.224
You're not just saying that
to get out of the doghouse?

37:22.325 --> 37:24.159
No, I-I do, I...

37:26.029 --> 37:28.597
I really love you.

37:31.601 --> 37:34.169
Good, 'cause I love you too,

37:34.270 --> 37:35.937
cowboy.

37:47.116 --> 37:48.950
Hey, Luke.

37:49.052 --> 37:51.853
You can come back and hang out anytime,
okay?

37:51.954 --> 37:53.522
Okay.

37:53.623 --> 37:55.357
Yeah, there you go.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.165
So, obviously a better day?

38:04.267 --> 38:06.168
Yeah, yeah, he's uh, he's a good kid.

38:06.269 --> 38:07.903
Um...

38:08.004 --> 38:10.505
so his Mom really isn't
seeing anything at home?

38:10.606 --> 38:12.708
That's what she told me.

38:12.809 --> 38:14.710
What about his Dad?

38:14.811 --> 38:17.112
- He's not in the picture.
- Oh...

38:17.213 --> 38:18.980
Look,
I know there's more to the story too.

38:19.082 --> 38:21.316
I was hoping you could help
me get to the bottom of it.

38:21.417 --> 38:23.118
Well,
I do know that the other kids tease him

38:23.219 --> 38:25.554
about his Mom,
that's what the fight was about.

38:25.655 --> 38:26.855
Ah.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.657
I didn't wanna press him on it though,
you know.

38:28.758 --> 38:29.991
Not yet.

38:30.093 --> 38:31.626
Duly noted.

38:31.728 --> 38:33.829
- I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.433
- Hi!
- Hi.

38:38.534 --> 38:40.001
You really think he's
ready for tomorrow?

38:40.103 --> 38:41.403
Yeah, I think so.

38:41.504 --> 38:43.271
But I want you two to go
on a bareback trail ride,

38:43.373 --> 38:45.273
you know, just to get
comfortable without the saddle.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.008
Oh yeah, I'd love to!

38:47.110 --> 38:49.611
- Oh hey.
- Hey.

38:49.712 --> 38:52.013
Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?

38:52.115 --> 38:53.348
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

38:53.449 --> 38:54.549
But look before you do, I just,

38:54.650 --> 38:57.152
- I wanna thank you, um...
- About that.

38:57.253 --> 38:59.888
Sorry, what were you gonna say?

38:59.989 --> 39:02.891
You know the advice you gave me,
following my heart?

39:02.992 --> 39:05.961
I think it's gonna work
out with Maya and I.

39:06.062 --> 39:07.963
I'm really happy that
you're here to help me

39:08.064 --> 39:10.132
navigate through all this, Lou.

39:13.669 --> 39:15.504
I'm sorry though, what did you...

39:15.605 --> 39:17.272
what did you wanna talk to me about?

39:19.409 --> 39:21.209
I just wanted to say that...

39:23.212 --> 39:25.013
I just wanted to tell you,

39:26.215 --> 39:28.316
um...

39:28.418 --> 39:30.819
that I'm-I'm going back to New York.

39:32.755 --> 39:34.189
Oh.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.824
I-I just need to get
a little more hands-on

39:35.925 --> 39:37.959
with Maggie's.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.494
Okay, um...

39:40.563 --> 39:43.298
I just-I thought you were
kinda done with that,

39:43.399 --> 39:45.734
like, you were...

39:45.835 --> 39:47.436
Something came up.

39:50.473 --> 39:52.941
Okay, well...

39:53.042 --> 39:56.044
good luck, I guess.

39:56.145 --> 39:58.780
Bareback trail ride,
let's do this!

40:00.983 --> 40:02.984
Yeah, okay! I'm in.

40:15.198 --> 40:17.232
- Hey, cowboy.
- All right.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.301
- Let's go.
- Go!

40:32.484 --> 40:34.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:34.453 --> 40:37.622
- I thought you'd gone home.
- Um...

40:37.723 --> 40:40.558
I just wanna... heh.

40:42.694 --> 40:44.595
I wanna be your friend.

40:45.864 --> 40:47.765
Okay. Well good,

40:47.866 --> 40:50.935
because I wanna be your friend, too.

40:51.036 --> 40:52.921
Okay, cool.

40:53.472 --> 40:56.707
Um, it's just,
seeing your Mom and Mitch,

40:56.808 --> 40:58.509
I think that it would
go a whole lot smoother

40:58.610 --> 41:02.246
if we avoid giving each
other relationship advice.

41:02.347 --> 41:04.715
Yeah, let's-let's not go there.

41:04.816 --> 41:06.917
Okay, cool.

41:07.019 --> 41:09.053
Um, on that note,

41:09.154 --> 41:11.656
is there anyone that I...

41:11.757 --> 41:15.286
shouldn't be giving you advice about?

41:16.395 --> 41:18.629
No, nope.

41:19.831 --> 41:22.199
Is there anybody that I-I...

41:22.300 --> 41:24.802
should not be talking to you about?

41:24.903 --> 41:26.103
- Nope.
- No.

41:26.204 --> 41:30.207
And if there is,
you'll be the first to not know.

41:30.308 --> 41:32.109
Great.

41:32.210 --> 41:34.211
Wanna help me brush him out?

41:34.312 --> 41:36.280
Uh, yeah. Sure.

41:36.381 --> 41:38.182
Here.

42:06.244 --> 42:07.578
Again!

42:07.679 --> 42:09.213
Good job,
Lyndy!

42:09.314 --> 42:11.115
Okay, go check it out!

42:11.216 --> 42:13.117
Go check it out! What's in there?

42:15.220 --> 42:17.988
- Do you like that?
- Ty, she absolutely loves it.

42:18.090 --> 42:19.523
Yeah, she does.

42:21.493 --> 42:24.028
I feel like the luckiest
man on earth right now.

42:24.129 --> 42:26.831
Because I came here, because of you.

42:26.932 --> 42:28.999
Hmm.

42:29.101 --> 42:31.335
I'm gonna come up there.

42:31.436 --> 42:33.704
- Ooh!
- Graceful.

42:35.707 --> 42:37.808
I just hope I can pay it forward,

42:37.909 --> 42:40.678
you know? Give Luke a shot.

42:40.779 --> 42:42.880
I think he's going through
some of the same things

42:42.981 --> 42:45.049
- that I did with my Mom.
- Yeah?

42:45.150 --> 42:48.085
Yeah, he's just so protective over her.

42:48.186 --> 42:49.420
I'm thinking it's some guy,

42:49.521 --> 42:52.903
or... or herself.

42:53.391 --> 42:55.292
Or both.

42:55.393 --> 42:59.029
Whatever it is...

42:59.131 --> 43:01.761
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help him get through it.

43:02.634 --> 43:04.401
I love you, you know that?

43:09.808 --> 43:11.575
Oh hi!

43:11.676 --> 43:14.712
- Do you like the treehouse?
- I'm gonna come get ya!

43:14.813 --> 43:16.380
- I'm gonna come get ya!
- No!

43:18.350 --> 43:21.285
Here we come! Gonna get ya!

43:22.621 --> 43:24.522
Mommy!
