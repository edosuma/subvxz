00:12.003 --> 00:14.777
Fire at one, this is
Castle requesting an update.

00:14.893 --> 00:18.523
One. Commander McGarrett has
the prisoner secure. Over.

00:21.683 --> 00:22.969
You know what's funny.

00:24.046 --> 00:25.565
You don't look Hawaiian.

00:28.470 --> 00:29.927
You're gonna tell us everything.

00:30.099 --> 00:32.409
But you were born there,
weren't you?

00:32.436 --> 00:34.961
Every terrorist cell you
and Victor helped arm,

00:35.683 --> 00:36.984
every supplier you've worked with,

00:36.985 --> 00:38.594
all your trafficking associates,

00:38.595 --> 00:40.489
everyone you've ever
sold weapons to.

00:40.691 --> 00:43.204
Chasing my brother and I around
the world for five years,

00:43.205 --> 00:45.450
like a little doggy
looking for a bone.

00:46.344 --> 00:49.459
You don't think we'd
do our homework on you?

00:55.453 --> 00:56.731
You should get that.

00:57.233 --> 00:59.537
You don't speak to your
father nearly enough.

01:05.578 --> 01:06.536
Dad.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.010
Hey, Champ.

01:10.468 --> 01:11.108
You all right?

01:13.582 --> 01:15.457
Who are these people, Steve?

01:16.027 --> 01:17.859
Now I know where you get it from.

01:18.213 --> 01:20.059
You've got a tough old man here.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.363
Steve, we both have
something to lose here.

01:22.856 --> 01:24.852
So listen to me very carefully.

01:25.295 --> 01:26.622
I'm offering you a trade.

01:27.983 --> 01:29.822
Your father for my brother.

01:30.642 --> 01:31.716
All things considered,

01:31.717 --> 01:33.605
I'd say it's more than generous,
wouldn't you?

01:33.992 --> 01:35.815
You're smart enough to know
that's never gonna happen.

01:35.816 --> 01:37.414
I appreciate the compliment.

01:37.648 --> 01:39.536
Are you smart enough?

01:40.670 --> 01:42.509
Come on, Victor.
You know how this works.

01:42.510 --> 01:44.403
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.851
Make an exception.

01:46.531 --> 01:49.099
Ghost to One. I triangulated
their cell signal.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.395
The convoy's ten miles
west of your position.

01:52.315 --> 01:53.922
I'm not gonna negotiate like this.

01:53.923 --> 01:55.625
Oh, are we negotiating now?

01:55.843 --> 01:58.298
You kill him, you get nothing.

01:58.636 --> 01:59.771
Give me the phone.

01:59.999 --> 02:00.966
Please.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.582
I can get him to help you.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.420
He'll listen to me. He's my son.

02:09.398 --> 02:10.836
Listen to me, Champ.

02:11.014 --> 02:13.154
Dad, I'm gonna get you
out of there, all right?

02:13.155 --> 02:14.323
Don't you worry about it.

02:14.773 --> 02:16.218
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.353
What? Lied to me about what, Dad?

02:19.354 --> 02:20.309
What are you talking about?

02:20.310 --> 02:21.821
I love you, Son.

02:22.165 --> 02:23.821
I didn't say it enough.

02:24.039 --> 02:26.444
Whatever these people want, Steve,

02:28.647 --> 02:30.123
don't give it to them.

02:30.315 --> 02:31.905
Don't you give it to them!

02:32.523 --> 02:33.217
Dad? Dad?!

02:33.218 --> 02:34.386
No more games!

02:34.387 --> 02:35.510
I'm taking my brother now!

02:35.511 --> 02:38.291
I swear to God, I will hunt
you down and I will kill you.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.339
Hey. Boom.

02:47.783 --> 02:49.275
This is Transport.
We're under attack.

02:49.276 --> 02:51.566
Taking rocket and
small arms fire...

02:53.582 --> 02:55.299
Everybody, move it! Move!

02:55.300 --> 02:56.690
Sarge! Sir!

02:59.680 --> 03:00.654
Come on!

03:01.138 --> 03:02.609
Come on! Go!

03:09.013 --> 03:10.532
Come on!

03:11.704 --> 03:13.059
Get down!

03:18.367 --> 03:21.294
Man down! Man down!
Watch your cover! Move!

03:21.295 --> 03:23.101
Quick! Quick! Quick!
Quick! Watch it.

03:23.102 --> 03:24.290
Men, move out!

03:24.464 --> 03:25.367
Come here.

03:39.201 --> 03:41.135
Come on. Come on.

03:41.249 --> 03:42.246
Come here.

03:49.364 --> 03:50.650
No! No! No! Get down!

03:56.353 --> 03:57.487
No! No! Don't do it!

03:57.488 --> 03:58.519
Put it down!

04:11.465 --> 04:12.576
Come on, Anton.

04:13.535 --> 04:14.398
Come on.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.401
Come on, Anton.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.692
No! No! No!

04:43.465 --> 04:44.679
What happened?

04:45.674 --> 04:46.486
Victor...

04:46.487 --> 04:47.378
Listen.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.314
Put Anton on the phone.

04:50.982 --> 04:52.173
My brother's dead,

04:53.350 --> 04:54.242
isn't he?

04:54.243 --> 04:55.171
Victor, listen.

04:55.172 --> 04:56.058
Isn't he?!

04:59.939 --> 05:01.617
Then so is your father.

05:03.396 --> 05:04.754
No!

Honolulu approach. Reach 717.

05:43.294 --> 05:45.100
Level at 3,000.

05:45.217 --> 05:46.588
717, turn left

05:46.589 --> 05:48.571
zero-one-zero, maintain 3,000

05:48.572 --> 05:50.065
until established on approach.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.616
How long since you've been home?

05:55.273 --> 05:56.511
It's been a while.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.881
Sir, I've got a call

06:03.882 --> 06:06.093
coming in for you from
the governor of Hawaii.

06:18.943 --> 06:19.888
Commander?

06:21.563 --> 06:22.174
Governor.

06:22.175 --> 06:23.877
Thanks for agreeing to see me.

06:24.215 --> 06:26.325
I am so sorry about your loss.

06:26.567 --> 06:28.062
Is this about the investigation?

06:28.149 --> 06:29.803
Yes. We have alerts
across all the islands.

06:29.804 --> 06:30.808
You won't find Victor Hesse

06:30.809 --> 06:32.464
with roadblocks and
search warrants.

06:32.465 --> 06:34.404
He's gone underground until
he can find a safe way

06:34.405 --> 06:35.352
to leave the island.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.735
Now why am I here?

06:36.938 --> 06:39.257
I'd like to help you get
what you came back here for.

06:39.884 --> 06:40.913
Let's walk.

06:41.386 --> 06:42.814
Your father's death
was a wake-up call

06:42.815 --> 06:46.162
to me and every law enforcement
agency in Hawaii, which is why

06:46.163 --> 06:48.761
I'm putting together a task force,
and I want you to run it.

06:50.299 --> 06:51.289
You don't even know me.

06:51.290 --> 06:52.378
I know your resume.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.761
Annapolis.

06:53.971 --> 06:55.674
Five years, Naval Intelligence.

06:55.675 --> 06:56.945
Six with the SEALS.

06:57.411 --> 06:59.682
Your superiors say
that you are the best

06:59.683 --> 07:00.645
that they have ever seen.

07:00.646 --> 07:02.017
Let me stop you right there.

07:02.474 --> 07:05.032
I've been tracking Victor
Hesse for five years.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.525
If he was bold enough to surface,
I promise you

07:07.526 --> 07:09.302
he already has an
exit strategy planned,

07:09.303 --> 07:10.927
and he knows I know it,
which means,

07:11.104 --> 07:13.223
I can barely afford the
hour it's gonna take

07:13.224 --> 07:14.623
to bury my father,

07:14.817 --> 07:17.024
let alone stand
here talking to you.

07:17.530 --> 07:18.527
Excuse me.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.112
I can help you find
this son of a bitch.

07:21.385 --> 07:23.282
With full immunity and means.

07:23.283 --> 07:25.189
Your task force will have
full blanket authority

07:25.190 --> 07:26.400
to go after guys like Hesse

07:26.401 --> 07:29.417
and get them the
hell off my island.

07:31.589 --> 07:35.408
Your rules, my backing,
no red tape.

07:35.409 --> 07:37.360
And I promise you, Commander,

07:37.841 --> 07:39.742
what you see with
me is what you get.

07:39.743 --> 07:41.150
Here's what I see.

07:41.784 --> 07:42.932
An election year coming up,

07:42.933 --> 07:44.993
and a politician who needs the PR,

07:45.035 --> 07:46.746
who's willing to do
whatever it takes...

07:46.747 --> 07:48.483
including bringing me
down here to Pearl Harbor,

07:48.484 --> 07:49.927
where my grandfather was killed,

07:49.928 --> 07:52.072
so I might feel some
kind of obligation

07:52.073 --> 07:53.717
to fulfill my family destiny.

07:53.718 --> 07:55.026
Is that about right, Governor?

07:55.567 --> 07:58.076
None of those things make
me feel less responsible.

07:58.077 --> 07:59.899
I knew your father, Commander.

08:00.078 --> 08:02.162
This is personal for me, too.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.310
Pass.

08:06.005 --> 08:07.059
All right.

08:07.099 --> 08:08.596
Here's my private number.

08:09.286 --> 08:10.364
Please think it over.

08:11.183 --> 08:12.150
Thanks.

08:17.089 --> 08:18.735
She's a smart lady, that one.

08:19.703 --> 08:21.080
Steve McGarrett, right?

08:22.208 --> 08:23.143
I know you.

08:23.345 --> 08:25.760
You'd better. Chin Ho Kelly.

08:25.761 --> 08:28.173
Oh. Chin Ho Kelly.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.495
Kahuku High School.

08:29.808 --> 08:31.593
You were a great quarterback.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.131
Oh, that's very
kind of you to say,

08:33.131 --> 08:35.235
considering you were the one
that broke all my records.

08:35.236 --> 08:36.667
Oh, that was a long time ago.

08:37.597 --> 08:39.066
I heard you became a cop.

08:39.256 --> 08:40.994
I worked with your
father in the Seventh.

08:40.995 --> 08:43.417
He taught me everything I
know about wearing a badge.

08:43.852 --> 08:45.987
Looks like you moved
on to greener pasture.

08:46.029 --> 08:46.917
Well, let's just say,

08:46.918 --> 08:48.744
the Honolulu PD and
I had a disagreement

08:48.745 --> 08:50.302
over my job description.

08:50.576 --> 08:51.893
But your father understood.

08:52.129 --> 08:53.954
He was very good to
me after I was let go.

08:53.955 --> 08:56.385
He stayed my friend,
and I know that cost him something.

08:56.449 --> 08:58.895
I only wish there was some
way I could pay him back.

08:59.244 --> 09:02.321
But now that you're here,
maybe you can do something.

09:02.322 --> 09:03.266
What do you mean?

09:03.267 --> 09:05.185
I hear, the chief of
police put a haole

09:05.186 --> 09:07.435
on your father's murder
investigation. Word is,

09:07.436 --> 09:08.805
he's fresh meat from the mainland,

09:08.806 --> 09:11.402
which means he has no clue
how this island works.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.630
No, it's perfect.

09:18.407 --> 09:20.980
But I've been on hold so long,
I forgot who I was talking to.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.607
I need a warrant write-up
for a surveillance wire

09:23.608 --> 09:25.880
on a suspect in connection
to the John McGarrett murder.

09:25.881 --> 09:27.475
Suspects name is Doran.
Fred Doran.

09:27.476 --> 09:29.465
D-o-r-a-n.

09:31.012 --> 09:32.713
Yeah, that's terrific. Thank you.

09:38.902 --> 09:39.965
Hi, Daddy.

09:39.966 --> 09:41.446
Oh... oh!

09:41.447 --> 09:43.274
Thank you. It was a good hug.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.754
Who, uh... Who's that?

09:45.755 --> 09:47.903
Mr. Hoppy. Stan bought him for me

09:47.904 --> 09:49.632
for the animal show-and-tell.

09:49.884 --> 09:51.874
Oh, good old Step Stan.

09:52.221 --> 09:53.066
He's very cute.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.552
Not as cute as you, though.

09:55.370 --> 09:56.116
We'd better go.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.519
We don't want Mr. Hoppy to be late

09:57.520 --> 09:58.519
for his first day
of school, do we?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.797
No. That's right. All right.

10:01.055 --> 10:02.398
Where are you going? You driving?

10:02.622 --> 10:03.981
Hmm. Come on, let's go this way.

10:03.982 --> 10:05.047
You want to drive?

10:05.048 --> 10:06.604
You can't drive.
You're too little.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.231
Let's go. You're making
me dizzy. Come on.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.573
Hey, look at... What's that?

10:10.766 --> 10:12.539
Okay. What are you doing?
What are you looking at over there?

10:12.540 --> 10:13.331
Let's go. We got to go.

10:13.332 --> 10:14.620
We're gonna be late for school.

10:32.201 --> 10:33.664
I love you, son.

11:46.025 --> 11:47.320
Listen to me, Champ...

12:00.041 --> 12:01.864
I can't continue
this investigation into

12:01.865 --> 12:03.816
the police department
from the inside.

12:03.817 --> 12:05.840
I don't trust the
people I work with.

12:05.841 --> 12:07.928
So I'm gonna have to
do this on my own.

12:07.929 --> 12:09.271
It's all about the key.

12:09.298 --> 12:10.401
I just don't know what it's for.

12:10.402 --> 12:13.289
I have only been able
to find two source...

12:18.136 --> 12:20.086
You! Hands up! Don't move!
Who are you?

12:20.087 --> 12:22.463
Who are you? I am Detective
Danny Williams...

12:22.464 --> 12:23.490
Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett!

12:23.491 --> 12:25.249
This is my father's house.
Put your weapon down right now.

12:25.250 --> 12:29.174
Show me your I.D.
! You show me your I.D.! Right now!

12:29.175 --> 12:30.381
I'm not putting my gun down.

12:30.470 --> 12:31.580
Neither am I.

12:32.033 --> 12:34.072
Use your free hand,
take out your I.D.

12:34.073 --> 12:35.191
Please, after you.

12:35.818 --> 12:36.652
At the same time?

12:36.653 --> 12:38.723
At the same time? Yeah,
at the same time.

12:38.724 --> 12:39.637
What, like, on the count of three?

12:39.638 --> 12:41.217
Sure. Okay, three's good.

12:42.112 --> 12:42.930
One...

12:45.085 --> 12:46.051
...two...

12:47.700 --> 12:48.692
...three.

12:51.351 --> 12:52.259
Listen, uh,

12:52.260 --> 12:53.558
I'm really sorry
about your father,

12:53.559 --> 12:54.862
but you can't be here right now.

12:54.863 --> 12:56.509
This is an active crime scene.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.053
Doesn't seem that active.

12:58.393 --> 12:59.872
I can't share any
information with you.

12:59.873 --> 13:02.174
Hesse wasn't here alone
when my father was murdered.

13:02.578 --> 13:04.455
Someone was sitting at
the desk in the study...

13:04.456 --> 13:06.671
there was a space clear
for a 13-inch laptop

13:06.672 --> 13:08.383
and my father hated computers.

13:09.153 --> 13:10.941
I'm gonna ask you again-
you got to leave.

13:11.444 --> 13:12.090
You got it.

13:12.091 --> 13:14.577
And you can leave the box-
that is evidence.

13:14.578 --> 13:16.407
You know that. I came with this.

13:16.408 --> 13:17.836
No, you didn't come with it.

13:17.837 --> 13:18.713
I see the dust void it left

13:18.714 --> 13:21.085
right here on the counter-
what's in the box?

13:21.086 --> 13:22.765
How long you been
with the Honolulu PD?

13:22.766 --> 13:24.573
None of your business.
What are you, Barbara Walters?

13:24.574 --> 13:27.199
No, it is my business if you're
investigating my father's death.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.391
I am, and I'd like to get back

13:28.392 --> 13:29.466
to that, so the sooner you leave,

13:29.467 --> 13:30.993
the sooner I can.
Anything you say.

13:30.994 --> 13:33.444
Leave the box or get arrested,

13:33.445 --> 13:35.374
all right? You gonna
call for backup?

13:35.479 --> 13:36.763
An ambulance.

13:41.226 --> 13:41.642
Thank you.

13:41.643 --> 13:43.106
Don't thank me yet.

13:46.706 --> 13:47.657
What are you doing?

13:49.028 --> 13:51.067
Uh, yeah, Governor Jameson,
please?

13:51.068 --> 13:52.834
Tell her it's Steve McGarrett.
Oh, please.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.281
Commander,
Governor Jameson here.

13:55.282 --> 13:56.521
What can I do for you?

13:59.050 --> 14:00.915
Governor, I'll take the job.

14:02.059 --> 14:03.190
Well, let's just say
I found something

14:03.191 --> 14:04.394
that changed my mind.

14:04.813 --> 14:05.851
No, no, no, immediately.

14:05.852 --> 14:07.235
I'll transfer to the reserves,

14:07.236 --> 14:08.711
and I'll run your task force.

14:09.968 --> 14:11.622
Wha... What, right now?

14:12.528 --> 14:13.421
Okay.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.277
"I, Steven J. McGarrett,

14:19.278 --> 14:21.540
"Do solemnly declare upon
my honor and conscience

14:21.541 --> 14:22.916
"That I will act at all times

14:22.917 --> 14:24.923
"To the best of my
ability and knowledge

14:25.133 --> 14:27.132
in a manner befitting
an officer of the law."

14:28.133 --> 14:29.434
Thank you, Governor.

14:31.749 --> 14:33.339
Now it's my crime scene.

14:53.572 --> 14:55.239
I swung by your precinct,
spoke to your captain.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.395
He said you requested a wire

14:56.396 --> 14:58.527
be put on someone
named Fred Doran.

14:58.562 --> 15:00.448
Tell me about it. Come in.

15:03.261 --> 15:03.863
This your kid?

15:03.864 --> 15:05.831
Yeah, that's stunning
detective work.

15:06.176 --> 15:09.621
You don't actually let her...
stay here with you, do you?

15:10.263 --> 15:12.397
What are you, uh, Nanny 911?

15:12.720 --> 15:16.062
So, what do you know
about this guy... Doran?

15:16.409 --> 15:18.616
Oh, but surely,
you don't need my help, right?

15:18.910 --> 15:20.083
Enlighten me.

15:20.694 --> 15:22.446
He's a suspected arms dealer.

15:22.447 --> 15:24.977
Two years Maui Correctional
for weapons possession.

15:24.978 --> 15:26.346
He's currently a
person of interest

15:26.347 --> 15:27.945
in an unrelated homicide.

15:27.946 --> 15:29.473
The weapon was never found.

15:29.474 --> 15:31.704
So, what's he got to do
with my father's case?

15:33.089 --> 15:34.656
When I ran a ballistics comparison

15:34.657 --> 15:35.716
to the bullet that
killed your dad,

15:35.717 --> 15:37.877
I got a hit to the
Doran investigation.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.027
See, I think the first thing

15:39.028 --> 15:40.806
that Hesse did when
he got on the island

15:41.004 --> 15:43.000
was hook up with
Doran and get a gun.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.116
And maybe Doran still
knows where he is,

15:45.117 --> 15:46.772
so let's go talk to him.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.756
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

15:49.030 --> 15:50.259
Are you suffering from dementia?

15:50.260 --> 15:52.074
This is no longer my case.

15:52.075 --> 15:54.268
The captain said you
transferred in from New Jersey

15:54.269 --> 15:55.999
six months ago,
so your eye's still fresh.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.490
You know, I appreciate it,

15:57.491 --> 15:59.199
but my psych eval's
not for six weeks.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.861
Fold-out bed,
no ring on your finger.

16:00.862 --> 16:03.100
You obviously moved here to
be close to your daughter.

16:03.101 --> 16:04.933
Which means in between visits,
all you got

16:04.934 --> 16:06.289
is your job and you
take pride in it.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.332
That's what I'm looking for.
Yeah, but you know what?

16:08.333 --> 16:09.894
It's guys like you,
they think they know how

16:09.895 --> 16:13.081
to do everything better,
and that only makes my job harder.

16:14.746 --> 16:16.321
You got no choice, Detective.

16:16.562 --> 16:18.841
Governor gave me jurisdiction-
I'm making you my partner.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.992
We're gonna get along great.

16:21.076 --> 16:22.324
That's me *

16:22.948 --> 16:26.084
The boy with the broken halo *

16:26.085 --> 16:27.386
That's me *

16:27.760 --> 16:29.142
That's me *

16:30.039 --> 16:32.518
They're never gonna let me be... *

16:42.678 --> 16:44.715
I take it your marriage
didn't end too well.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.293
No.

16:46.799 --> 16:49.094
It would have had
my ex not remarried

16:49.095 --> 16:52.769
and dragged my daughter to this
pineapple-infested hellhole.

16:53.058 --> 16:54.409
You don't like the beach?

16:54.714 --> 16:55.906
I don't like the beach.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.200
Who doesn't like the beach?

16:57.201 --> 16:59.199
I like, uh, cities, you know.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.352
Skyscrapers,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.547
no tsunamis, no jellyfish.

17:02.548 --> 17:03.963
Tell me you can swim.

17:04.008 --> 17:05.926
Can I swim? You don't
know how to swim.

17:05.928 --> 17:08.656
I know how... I swim-
I swim for survival, not for fun.

17:08.657 --> 17:09.575
All right.

17:12.652 --> 17:13.784
Yes, dear?

17:16.026 --> 17:17.833
Hey, monkey.

17:18.227 --> 17:18.913
No, no, no,

17:18.914 --> 17:20.329
I thought you were your mom.

17:21.356 --> 17:24.249
I am so glad that
everybody liked Mr. Hoppy.

17:25.189 --> 17:25.999
I'm excited too, baby.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.031
We're gonna have so
much fun this weekend.

17:28.777 --> 17:29.586
Hey.

17:29.587 --> 17:31.010
Danno loves you.

17:35.730 --> 17:36.849
Who's Danno?

17:36.850 --> 17:37.565
Don't.

17:37.566 --> 17:38.427
Hmm?

17:38.428 --> 17:39.301
Just...

17:39.302 --> 17:40.340
Okay.

17:40.785 --> 17:41.824
Thank you.

17:42.914 --> 17:43.849
Yeah.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.831
Hey, hey, hey! *

18:01.735 --> 18:02.927
This guy Doran's a shooter,
all right?

18:02.928 --> 18:04.717
We shouldn't be doing
this without backup.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.057
You are the backup.

18:06.058 --> 18:07.385
I'm the backup.

18:07.906 --> 18:09.777
I hate him. I hate him so much.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.931
Hey. Hey, slow down, huh?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.796
You ruined my life!

18:20.988 --> 18:23.306
You know what, you need
to be quiet. Sit down!

18:27.632 --> 18:29.182
Get your ass back here!

18:29.341 --> 18:31.522
Tracy? Tracy?

18:41.050 --> 18:42.858
Danny! Go! Go! Go!

19:09.429 --> 19:11.212
Put your gun down!
We don't have to do this, man.

19:11.213 --> 19:12.779
I said put the gun down!

19:12.797 --> 19:14.583
You sold a weapon to a
man named Victor Hesse.

19:14.584 --> 19:16.259
I'm not after you. I want him.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.918
I'm not talking to you!
Where is he?

19:17.919 --> 19:19.212
I said I'm not talking to you!

19:19.213 --> 19:20.932
Now put the gun down,
or I'll kill her!

19:20.933 --> 19:22.267
You don't think I'll do it?

19:22.268 --> 19:23.300
I'll do it!

19:23.301 --> 19:24.795
I'll kill her right now!

19:41.803 --> 19:43.241
I hope it hurts!

19:43.496 --> 19:45.109
Careful, she bites.

20:02.085 --> 20:04.692
It's okay. It's okay.

20:04.693 --> 20:05.847
It's okay.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.499
It's okay.

20:09.629 --> 20:12.066
It's okay. What's your name?

20:14.301 --> 20:16.195
<i>Ni jiào shén ma míng z?</i>

20:16.677 --> 20:17.308
Chen-Chi.

20:17.309 --> 20:19.221
Chen-Chi. Chen-Chi.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.959
<i>Gen wo lái.</i>

20:22.219 --> 20:23.625
<i>Gen wo lái.</i>

20:25.444 --> 20:27.237
Okay, so she was
smuggled in four days ago

20:27.238 --> 20:28.615
in a cargo ship from China,

20:28.616 --> 20:30.574
with her parents,
a couple hundred refugees.

20:30.575 --> 20:31.978
She gets here,
she's traded to Doran.

20:31.979 --> 20:33.730
Okay, excuse me, I'm sorry,

20:33.731 --> 20:35.795
this is typically
where you would, uh,

20:35.796 --> 20:37.690
say "Thank you"
For saving your life.

20:38.052 --> 20:40.242
You just shot my only lead.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.589
Are you kidding me?

20:41.590 --> 20:42.662
Are you kidding me?
These are the same guys

20:42.663 --> 20:44.382
that are moving
people out of Asia.

20:44.383 --> 20:46.372
They could've smuggled
Hesse into Hawaii.

20:46.373 --> 20:49.198
You just took a stupid risk, okay?

20:49.199 --> 20:50.170
Understand that.

20:50.171 --> 20:51.706
I am not getting myself killed

20:51.707 --> 20:52.669
for your vendetta.

20:52.670 --> 20:53.973
I have a daughter, okay?

20:53.974 --> 20:56.206
Yeah, that girl there is
someone's daughter, too.

20:56.207 --> 20:57.959
You don't get it.
You don't get it.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.509
I mean, for somebody who
just lost his father,

20:59.510 --> 21:01.067
you're pretty dense.
What'd you just say?

21:01.565 --> 21:05.150
What'd you just say to me!
What if she was yours, huh?

21:05.151 --> 21:06.261
Is there anything that you

21:06.262 --> 21:08.088
would not do to hunt
down the son of a bitch

21:08.089 --> 21:08.912
that did that to
her and killed her?

21:08.913 --> 21:10.779
Do not question my resolve...

21:10.780 --> 21:12.755
One warning... take your
finger out of my face.

21:12.756 --> 21:14.481
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

21:14.482 --> 21:16.252
Aah! What did I tell you?

21:16.253 --> 21:17.735
I warned you. What are you,
a ninja? Let go.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.141
In front of all these
nice people... it's fine.

21:20.142 --> 21:21.613
Go back to work. It's fine.

21:22.359 --> 21:23.981
Now, you don't have to like me,

21:24.129 --> 21:26.262
but right now, there's no
one else to do this job.

21:26.263 --> 21:27.907
Okay. Let me go.

21:32.915 --> 21:35.016
All right, look, we need to
find these human trafficker...

21:38.056 --> 21:39.462
You're right, I don't like you.

21:41.687 --> 21:42.926
Son of a...

21:50.087 --> 21:51.159
How's the arm?

21:52.225 --> 21:53.638
Let's just not talk.

21:53.639 --> 21:55.328
You mean right now or ever again?

21:55.329 --> 21:56.849
Just both, okay?

21:56.850 --> 21:58.586
You know, I think...
I think I might know why

21:58.587 --> 22:00.016
your wife left you. Really?

22:00.017 --> 22:01.473
Yeah, you're very sensitive.

22:02.198 --> 22:04.008
I'm sensitive, huh? Yeah.

22:04.009 --> 22:06.060
You think I'm sensitive? Well,
a little bit, you know.

22:06.061 --> 22:08.545
When did you come to the conclusion
that I was sensitive, huh?

22:08.546 --> 22:10.512
Was it when a bullet was
tearing through my flesh,

22:10.513 --> 22:12.261
is that when I seemed
sensitive to you?

22:12.262 --> 22:13.884
Huh? I am really happy

22:13.885 --> 22:16.068
that you are not
afraid of anything.

22:16.069 --> 22:18.738
Okay? I'm glad that
you have that GI Joe

22:18.739 --> 22:20.098
thousand-yard stare

22:20.099 --> 22:22.405
from chasing shoe-bombers
around the world, okay?

22:22.406 --> 22:25.452
But in civilized society,
we have rules, all right?

22:25.453 --> 22:26.969
It is the unspoken glue

22:26.970 --> 22:29.871
that separates us from
jackals and hyenas,

22:29.872 --> 22:31.079
all right? Jackals and hyenas.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.453
Animal Planet, whatever.

22:32.454 --> 22:33.455
Okay? The point is,

22:33.456 --> 22:34.361
rule number one:

22:34.362 --> 22:37.224
If you get somebody shot,
you apologize!

22:37.225 --> 22:39.572
I'm sorry. You don't wait
for a special occasion.

22:39.573 --> 22:41.593
I'm sorry. Okay? Like birthdays,

22:41.594 --> 22:42.640
I'm sorry. Frickin'
President's Day...

22:42.641 --> 22:43.882
Hey, man, I'm sorry, okay?

22:43.883 --> 22:45.831
I said I'm sorry, sincerely sorry.

22:46.273 --> 22:48.742
That's what I was trying
to tell you last year

22:49.032 --> 22:51.064
when this conversation
first started.

22:55.609 --> 22:58.705
Your, uh... apology is noted.

22:58.706 --> 23:00.250
Acceptance is pending.

23:00.251 --> 23:01.472
You let me know, now.

23:01.473 --> 23:03.168
Yeah. I'll let you know.

23:03.524 --> 23:04.830
Make the next left up here.

23:04.831 --> 23:07.486
Why? I think I know
someone who can help us.

23:09.482 --> 23:10.895
Her name is Chen-Chi.

23:14.424 --> 23:15.454
Where'd you find her?

23:15.455 --> 23:16.691
Locked in a house.

23:17.142 --> 23:18.932
She came here to start a new life.

23:18.933 --> 23:21.171
They drugged her and turned
her into a prostitute.

23:21.693 --> 23:22.469
The guy we're looking for

23:22.470 --> 23:24.951
is high-profile: Victor Hesse.

23:25.143 --> 23:27.975
CIA, FBI, Interpol-
he's on everyone's radar.

23:27.976 --> 23:29.265
Which means he
didn't just land here

23:29.266 --> 23:31.791
and get his passport stamped-
he was back-channeled in.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.371
Mm. And you think the same network

23:33.372 --> 23:35.652
that brought this girl to the
island smuggled Hesse in.

23:35.653 --> 23:36.286
Well, he made a fortune

23:36.287 --> 23:37.992
trafficking kids out
of Malaysia, so...

23:37.993 --> 23:39.663
Then you're looking
for a snakehead.

23:40.105 --> 23:41.181
Local Chinese gangs

23:41.182 --> 23:42.556
that specialize in
human smuggling.

23:42.557 --> 23:43.535
Okay, we need a name.

23:43.536 --> 23:45.799
Are you kidding? Look at me.

23:46.128 --> 23:47.400
I'm a rubber gun now.

23:47.401 --> 23:49.539
Come on, you were on
the force for 15 years.

23:50.941 --> 23:54.157
Okay, look, I know a guy
who's got ties to that world.

23:54.158 --> 23:55.852
Great. Get us an intro.

23:55.853 --> 23:56.834
Forget it.

23:57.180 --> 23:59.067
He's a former
confidential informant.

23:59.068 --> 24:00.410
He trusts no one.

24:00.786 --> 24:02.289
Especially haoles.

24:02.314 --> 24:03.617
You talk to him, then. I'm busy.

24:03.618 --> 24:04.651
You're busy? What, you expecting

24:04.652 --> 24:06.729
a crime wave in the gift
shop this afternoon?

24:06.943 --> 24:10.170
Look... I can't be a cop anymore.

24:10.171 --> 24:12.133
Why not? Because I can't be!

24:12.313 --> 24:13.455
You understand?

24:14.855 --> 24:16.873
HPD accused me of taking payoffs.

24:16.874 --> 24:18.863
So I'm the last person the
department wants to see

24:18.864 --> 24:20.069
wearing a badge.

24:21.369 --> 24:22.503
I got to go.

24:23.215 --> 24:25.422
This is going really well.
Did you take the money?

24:25.423 --> 24:26.595
Excuse me?

24:31.189 --> 24:32.204
Did you...

24:33.070 --> 24:34.324
take the money?

24:36.350 --> 24:37.309
No.

24:40.574 --> 24:41.773
Then come with us...

24:42.542 --> 24:44.762
and we don't need to
talk about this again.

24:45.591 --> 24:46.360
Ever.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.431
This is your ticket
back into the game.

24:48.432 --> 24:50.627
Call it payback,
call it whatever you want,

24:50.628 --> 24:52.270
I don't care, but I need you.

24:54.624 --> 24:56.109
How do you know you can trust me?

24:56.764 --> 24:58.481
Because my old man did.

25:07.411 --> 25:09.921
I used to carry a Glock on the waistline..

25:09.922 --> 25:12.464
Man, I don't waste time, I'm strong on the
bass line...

25:12.465 --> 25:13.693
You never will taste mine...

25:13.694 --> 25:16.809
See me on the streets begging for
face time...

25:16.810 --> 25:18.234
Get your own tape but don't bother *

25:18.235 --> 25:20.535
To chase mine, I got a Glock... *

25:20.536 --> 25:22.151
Hey, Kamekona!

25:23.697 --> 25:26.103
How's it...? Good to see you,
my brother.

25:26.754 --> 25:28.458
Hey, bro. Hmm?

25:28.459 --> 25:29.616
I need a name.

25:30.826 --> 25:32.329
Hey, wait out there.

25:34.234 --> 25:35.433
After they pay.

25:36.858 --> 25:39.456
Two cones, two T-shirts to go.

25:39.525 --> 25:40.507
Medium.

25:40.766 --> 25:42.157
X-L and up, brah.

25:42.158 --> 25:44.484
My face don't fit
on anything smaller.

25:45.703 --> 25:47.422
How much kala, bulleh?

25:48.385 --> 25:49.575
You speak bird, huh?

25:49.576 --> 25:50.712
Yeah, I grew up here.

25:50.713 --> 25:52.918
Don't matter,
you still look hauli to me.

25:56.151 --> 25:58.145
This one feels a little
bit lonely, brah.

26:02.809 --> 26:03.759
Cool!

26:04.964 --> 26:06.930
One more thing-
I need you two fine

26:06.931 --> 26:08.761
white gentlemens to do.

26:18.219 --> 26:19.601
Are you a cop?

26:20.267 --> 26:21.185
No.

26:21.232 --> 26:23.206
Well, you look like a cop.

26:25.014 --> 26:26.774
You like cotton candy?
Go find your mom.

26:26.775 --> 26:28.544
I don't like cotton candy.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.439
I got something you
might like, okay?

26:30.969 --> 26:32.118
How about...

26:33.714 --> 26:35.162
How about that? Yeah.

26:35.163 --> 26:35.944
Thanks.

26:35.945 --> 26:37.071
You're welcome.

26:40.537 --> 26:41.407
What?

26:46.112 --> 26:47.247
You'd better have a meeting.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.621
***

26:52.479 --> 26:53.429
Sang Min.

26:53.627 --> 26:55.243
Came here from China
eight years ago,

26:55.244 --> 26:57.002
and according to my man Kamekona,

26:57.003 --> 26:59.137
he runs the island's human
import/export business.

26:59.138 --> 27:00.589
So Hesse could've
used him to get on

27:00.590 --> 27:03.358
or off the island.
So let's say this guy's for real.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.584
Still got no reason to tell us

27:04.585 --> 27:07.340
where Hesse is. Well,
we find some leverage, twist his arm.

27:07.341 --> 27:09.432
Define leverage.
Simple bait-and-trap.

27:09.433 --> 27:10.462
Wire up an undercover,

27:10.463 --> 27:11.336
send him in.

27:11.337 --> 27:12.769
Only one problem, malihini.

27:13.073 --> 27:14.649
That might work well
on the mainland,

27:14.650 --> 27:16.599
but we're on an island with
less than a million people.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.047
Which means the bad
guys know the good guys.

27:19.048 --> 27:21.938
So we need to look for
our bait outside the box.

27:21.939 --> 27:24.034
I take it you have the
perfect guy in mind?

27:24.035 --> 27:25.138
Oh, yeah.

27:25.736 --> 27:26.674
Gotta rise up *

27:26.955 --> 27:29.245
To the top, to the top, can't stop *

27:29.246 --> 27:30.539
How high can you get? *

27:30.540 --> 27:32.846
Cause what goes up must come down *

27:32.847 --> 27:35.669
So we gotta rise up to the higher
ground*

27:35.670 --> 27:38.149
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up *

27:38.150 --> 27:39.799
How high can you get? *

27:39.800 --> 27:41.023
That's your cousin?

27:41.556 --> 27:43.489
Choose your next words carefully,

27:43.900 --> 27:45.073
both of you.

27:45.902 --> 27:47.074
Well, she's very talented.

27:47.075 --> 27:48.640
Oh, she's off the charts.

27:48.641 --> 27:50.545
Spent three years on
the pro circuit before

27:50.546 --> 27:51.899
she blew out her knee.

27:51.900 --> 27:52.942
The kid was devastated.

27:52.943 --> 27:55.405
Had to reinvent herself,
and decided to wear a badge.

27:55.406 --> 27:57.732
Graduates from the
police academy in a week.

27:57.733 --> 27:59.411
Unfortunately, she's family,

27:59.412 --> 28:02.082
which means the HPD will
never take her seriously.

28:02.971 --> 28:04.361
Hey! Watch out!

28:05.356 --> 28:06.250
Oh!

28:10.836 --> 28:12.241
You sure she's ready for this?

28:12.660 --> 28:14.330
She's got no street experience.

28:15.308 --> 28:16.344
Ho, brah.

28:18.407 --> 28:19.423
Think twice next time

28:19.424 --> 28:21.421
you want to drop in
on someone's wave.

28:24.624 --> 28:25.935
Cousin!

28:27.463 --> 28:28.961
Oh, you had him,

28:28.962 --> 28:30.036
Water Woman!

28:30.431 --> 28:31.422
Double-overheads.

28:31.423 --> 28:33.511
Waste. First good
pipe of the season.

28:33.525 --> 28:35.337
Tourists... what you gonna do?

28:35.338 --> 28:37.838
Kono, meet Commander
Steve McGarrett

28:37.839 --> 28:39.337
and Detective Danny Williams.

28:39.338 --> 28:40.352
Nice right cross.

28:40.353 --> 28:42.351
Nah, man, that was a love tap.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.382
Hi.

28:45.503 --> 28:46.244
That's good, brah.

28:46.245 --> 28:47.771
Sure.

28:48.357 --> 28:49.223
So, your cousin tells us

28:49.224 --> 28:51.688
you're graduating from the
police academy next week.

28:52.345 --> 28:55.069
How'd you like to earn a little
extra credit before you do?

28:56.132 --> 28:57.332
I'm listening.

29:03.513 --> 29:04.383
Yo.

29:04.384 --> 29:06.951
Just spoke to Chin... he's setting
up the meet with Sang Min.

29:07.444 --> 29:08.922
I got that surveillance equipment

29:08.923 --> 29:11.105
you asked for.
You recognize this guy?

29:12.435 --> 29:13.753
No. Who is it?

29:14.113 --> 29:15.549
Jovan Etienne.

29:15.550 --> 29:17.083
File says he worked
for the Russians

29:17.084 --> 29:19.520
as a computer programmer in SVR.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.760
He was here when my
father was murdered.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.062
I found his palm prints

29:23.063 --> 29:24.981
in the study,
partial boot prints in here.

29:24.982 --> 29:25.899
Wait a minute, how do you know

29:25.900 --> 29:27.462
the boot print didn't
belong to Hesse?

29:27.463 --> 29:29.711
Hesse wears a size 11,
like me, except double-E.

29:29.712 --> 29:30.508
The prints I found

29:30.509 --> 29:31.785
were smaller, and Hesse

29:31.786 --> 29:33.185
gets his footwear custom-made.

29:33.186 --> 29:35.000
Direct-injected
polyurethane mid-sole

29:35.001 --> 29:36.681
with a nitrile rubber outsole.

29:36.682 --> 29:37.584
Oh.

29:37.986 --> 29:40.607
Your, uh, brain must be a...

29:41.513 --> 29:42.759
miserable place.

29:42.817 --> 29:43.768
I need a beer.

29:47.892 --> 29:48.629
You ever gonna tell me

29:48.630 --> 29:49.795
what Danno means?

29:49.796 --> 29:51.497
Yeah, when you tell
me what's in the box.

29:52.167 --> 29:54.224
Truth is, I don't know yet.

29:56.298 --> 29:57.481
All I know...

29:57.835 --> 29:59.793
is that my father
wanted me to find it.

30:00.145 --> 30:01.671
Right now it's just a puzzle.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.327
You know, me and Grace,
we like puzzles.

30:05.784 --> 30:06.926
You're a good father.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.098
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

30:08.099 --> 30:09.048
You know?

30:09.681 --> 30:11.447
There's three ways of
looking at it. One...

30:11.914 --> 30:14.341
could get myself killed chasing
some meth-head scumbag,

30:14.342 --> 30:16.084
and then what kind
of father would I be?

30:16.085 --> 30:18.209
I always looked up to
my father for that.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.488
You know, the sacrifices he made.

30:20.714 --> 30:22.576
I'm sure Grace is gonna
feel the same way.

30:22.630 --> 30:23.940
Yeah, maybe.

30:24.589 --> 30:25.543
Either that, or she may think

30:25.544 --> 30:27.364
I'm just a selfish son of a bitch.

30:28.549 --> 30:31.605
You know, the truth is,
this is all I got, I need this.

30:32.065 --> 30:33.079
I want to do what I'm good at,

30:33.080 --> 30:35.110
I want to be reminded
I'm good at what I do.

30:36.731 --> 30:39.560
If that means... having to put up

30:39.561 --> 30:41.688
with your twisted belief
that you are never wrong,

30:42.146 --> 30:43.327
so be it.

30:49.692 --> 30:50.956
So what's the third?

30:53.117 --> 30:55.436
Well, even if I tell myself
this isn't permanent...

30:56.254 --> 30:57.829
...it's Gracie's home now.

30:59.030 --> 31:00.645
It's my job to keep it safe.

31:05.605 --> 31:06.411
Yeah?

31:09.061 --> 31:09.885
All right.

31:10.109 --> 31:10.867
Good work.

31:12.588 --> 31:13.343
What do you got?

31:13.344 --> 31:14.422
That was Chin.

31:15.289 --> 31:16.529
Sang Min bought the pitch

31:16.530 --> 31:18.908
and meets Kono tomorrow morning.
All right, still no guarantee

31:18.909 --> 31:19.800
he's gonna tell us where Hesse is.

31:19.801 --> 31:20.776
He has to.

31:22.153 --> 31:23.385
This is the only chance I have

31:23.386 --> 31:25.132
of finding the man
who killed my father.

31:33.552 --> 31:35.478
All right, guys,
Kono's in play.

31:36.615 --> 31:37.598
Here we go.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.307
Okay, kid, just get him to say how

31:41.308 --> 31:43.003
he's smuggling these
people off the island.

31:43.004 --> 31:44.573
My friend says you need my help.

31:44.574 --> 31:46.883
I have an aunt and
uncle in Nanjing.

31:47.117 --> 31:49.107
They would very much
like to live here.

31:49.518 --> 31:51.494
I can have your family
here within a week.

31:51.495 --> 31:53.653
Getting them out of China's easy.

31:54.024 --> 31:56.605
Paying for it,
that's the hard part.

31:56.816 --> 31:58.326
I have money.

31:58.603 --> 32:00.633
Do you mind if I ask what you do?

32:01.515 --> 32:04.450
I work at the cannery
on Pacific...

32:04.843 --> 32:08.017
and weekends as a housekeeper
at the Royal Hawaiian.

32:08.355 --> 32:09.385
Two jobs?

32:09.691 --> 32:10.881
Very commendable.

32:11.124 --> 32:13.937
Only I'm afraid the kind of
money we're talking about

32:14.005 --> 32:15.731
might be out of your reach.

32:15.771 --> 32:17.034
Unless, of course,

32:17.435 --> 32:19.560
we find some other
form of payment.

32:23.882 --> 32:24.962
Sand.

32:25.412 --> 32:26.179
What kind of person

32:26.180 --> 32:28.562
working two jobs has
time to go to the beach?

32:28.563 --> 32:29.861
All right, that's it.
Pull the plug.

32:29.862 --> 32:31.093
Let's get her out of there. Relax.

32:31.094 --> 32:33.180
The kid can handle herself.
Hey, he smells trap,

32:33.181 --> 32:35.603
he's gonna kill her,
all right? Trust me.

32:35.604 --> 32:37.733
I surf during my lunch hour.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.458
Or maybe you're a cop.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.624
Did anyone check her for a wire?

32:42.625 --> 32:44.278
We checked her when she came in.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.110
Maybe you missed it.

32:50.048 --> 32:53.358
Take off your dress so I know
you're not wearing a wire.

33:08.788 --> 33:09.826
Turn around.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.730
I'd like to put my
dress back on now.

33:36.664 --> 33:38.272
What are...? What are you doing?

33:39.870 --> 33:42.066
I'm going to send this
photo to a friend of mine.

33:42.067 --> 33:43.429
Okay, we got a wire on that phone.

33:43.430 --> 33:44.520
Trace the call, Danny.

33:44.521 --> 33:46.775
And he's going to show
it to his friends.

33:46.776 --> 33:48.646
If anyone recognizes you...

33:48.647 --> 33:50.427
Mobile number. Unlisted.

33:50.589 --> 33:51.726
...you're dead.

33:52.690 --> 33:53.831
Got a location?

33:59.073 --> 33:59.759
Danny?

33:59.760 --> 34:01.265
Ringing inside my precinct.

34:01.266 --> 34:02.780
You got a mole in there.

34:04.058 --> 34:05.831
***

34:09.819 --> 34:10.913
We got to move.

34:22.803 --> 34:23.610
You're early.

34:23.612 --> 34:24.554
You all right?

34:26.402 --> 34:28.013
Down! Down on the floor!
Now! Down!

34:28.014 --> 34:29.732
Put your hands behind your back.

34:30.254 --> 34:32.299
Hey! Let me see your hands!

34:34.501 --> 34:35.475
Gun!

34:37.243 --> 34:38.266
Get down!

34:43.498 --> 34:44.322
Anybody hurt?

34:44.322 --> 34:45.129
Good!

34:45.130 --> 34:45.829
Good!

34:45.830 --> 34:46.837
Good.

35:06.347 --> 35:09.079
Keep your hands on
the steering wheel.

35:11.164 --> 35:12.610
Out of the car right now.

35:12.850 --> 35:14.296
Hands behind your head.

35:16.379 --> 35:17.335
We're clear.

35:18.682 --> 35:20.032
We got movement over here.

35:20.352 --> 35:20.932
Go ahead.

35:20.933 --> 35:22.200
Go ahead. I got you.

35:33.617 --> 35:34.822
Listen, Danny.

35:54.071 --> 35:55.492
Ni hao, Chen-Chi.

35:58.718 --> 35:59.773
Mama!

36:08.135 --> 36:09.839
Getting them out of China is easy.

36:10.066 --> 36:12.807
Paying for it-
that's the hard part.

36:14.025 --> 36:15.795
Laser Audio Surveillance.

36:15.817 --> 36:16.661
You don't need a wire

36:16.662 --> 36:18.799
to get a confession
out of your hupo ass.

36:19.664 --> 36:22.048
I'm going to sue
you for entrapment.

36:22.049 --> 36:23.753
And when I'm done collecting,

36:23.754 --> 36:26.087
I'm going to find that little
hottie you sent in here,

36:26.101 --> 36:29.692
and this time, I'm going
to be less of a gentleman.

36:33.452 --> 36:34.531
Sorry, boss.

36:35.141 --> 36:36.219
I didn't see anything.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.691
You didn't see anything?!

36:37.780 --> 36:38.904
Son of a bitch hit me!

36:38.905 --> 36:40.601
You want to file a report,
you're going to need a witness.

36:40.602 --> 36:42.105
Do you want to file a report?

36:42.777 --> 36:44.669
I want to go to jail now.

36:45.273 --> 36:46.279
Where is he?

36:46.697 --> 36:47.760
Where's Hesse?

36:49.507 --> 36:51.081
What about your wife and kid?

36:51.626 --> 36:52.792
You know where they are?

36:53.339 --> 36:54.448
I do.

36:57.322 --> 36:59.913
She's getting her nails
done on Kalakaua Avenue.

37:00.989 --> 37:03.702
And your boy is at
his private school

37:03.703 --> 37:04.875
in Diamond Head.

37:05.465 --> 37:06.696
You know, I wonder
what he's gonna think

37:06.697 --> 37:08.888
when he finds out that Daddy
takes kids just like him

37:08.889 --> 37:10.035
and puts them on the street

37:10.036 --> 37:11.153
to be pumped full
of black tar heroin,

37:11.154 --> 37:13.541
and then sold to
strangers like animals.

37:14.574 --> 37:15.924
You're going to jail.

37:16.367 --> 37:17.882
That part's not up
for negotiation.

37:17.883 --> 37:21.517
Your family is about to
lose a husband and a father.

37:22.568 --> 37:25.302
In my eyes, now they're
your victims, too.

37:25.303 --> 37:27.934
The trouble is, the law
doesn't see it that way.

37:27.935 --> 37:30.150
Your wife... she's from Rwanda.

37:30.151 --> 37:31.365
She'll be sent back.

37:31.366 --> 37:32.478
They both will.

37:33.023 --> 37:33.809
If they're lucky,

37:33.810 --> 37:35.821
they'll make it to a refugee camp.

37:36.462 --> 37:37.629
And your son?

37:38.807 --> 37:42.012
Seven's old enough to hold
a gun for the Hutu Militia.

37:46.427 --> 37:47.880
I can prevent all that.

37:48.617 --> 37:50.537
But I don't help people
who don't help me.

37:56.519 --> 37:58.036
What kind of cops are you?

37:58.442 --> 37:59.603
The new kind.

38:01.668 --> 38:03.465
Okay. Okay.

38:04.769 --> 38:07.266
Sang Min put Hesse and
Etienne on a cargo ship

38:07.267 --> 38:08.928
headed for China... The Emma Karl.

38:08.929 --> 38:10.584
Steve,
do not even think of...

38:10.585 --> 38:12.012
Governor, you wanted a task force

38:12.013 --> 38:13.696
that would do whatever
was necessary.

38:13.697 --> 38:15.696
You promised me
immunity and means.

38:15.697 --> 38:19.245
No, no. Not... Not to provoke
a diplomatic incident

38:19.246 --> 38:21.869
by boarding a Chinese freighter

38:21.870 --> 38:23.403
headed for international waters.

38:23.404 --> 38:26.232
If China is caught smuggling
a terrorist, trust me,

38:26.233 --> 38:27.416
they won't say a word.

38:27.417 --> 38:28.792
I did my job, Governor.

38:28.793 --> 38:30.814
I found Hesse. Now you do yours.

38:30.854 --> 38:32.596
Tell the Coast Guard
to block the port.

38:32.597 --> 38:34.133
That ship is not going anywhere.

38:40.557 --> 38:44.395
Son of a bitch. Yeah.

38:44.396 --> 38:45.163
Rachel.

38:45.164 --> 38:46.812
Rachel, don't start with me.

38:46.813 --> 38:47.854
I left you two messages,

38:47.855 --> 38:49.635
telling you you
need to pick her up.

38:49.944 --> 38:51.894
Don't tell me you had
to change your plans.

38:51.895 --> 38:54.091
You send a driver for her
half the time anyway.

38:54.092 --> 38:56.405
I can't... I can't
do that right now.

38:56.406 --> 38:57.769
I'm in the middle of something.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.129
Please stop for a second.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.921
Can you just do me one favor?

39:01.340 --> 39:02.489
Just tell Gra...

39:03.225 --> 39:05.167
Tell Grace Danno loves her,
all right?

39:07.842 --> 39:08.743
Okay.

39:10.241 --> 39:12.016
Gracie was three,
she'd try to say my name,

39:12.017 --> 39:13.561
and all that she
could say was Danno.

39:13.562 --> 39:15.399
That's all that came out.
Danno. Okay?

39:16.393 --> 39:17.304
That's it?

39:17.529 --> 39:19.284
That's it. That's it.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.109
It's cute. Shut up.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.656
Why-Why... Why can't I think it's cute?
Don't... Because.

39:24.657 --> 39:26.430
Because I don't need you
thinking anything about us.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.158
It's between me and my
daughter. All right.

39:32.146 --> 39:33.971
There it is... The Emma Karl.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.676
Taking off. How do
you want to do this?!

39:37.958 --> 39:39.227
Right. Hold on.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.004
All right...

39:46.784 --> 39:47.652
All right.

39:48.054 --> 39:49.059
All right!

39:52.710 --> 39:54.221
Cover me. I'm gonna find Hesse.

40:01.575 --> 40:02.837
Go! Go!

41:24.651 --> 41:26.537
There's something you should
know about your brother.

41:26.896 --> 41:27.622
What about him?

41:27.623 --> 41:29.372
He died the same way you did.

41:48.793 --> 41:50.058
Put your hands behind your back.

41:50.059 --> 41:51.552
Don't make me shoot you again.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.432
Hey.

41:55.792 --> 41:57.749
Get the Coast Guard
to find that body.

41:58.378 --> 41:59.880
What do you want me
to do with this one?

42:01.482 --> 42:02.664
Book 'em, Danno.

42:04.118 --> 42:05.548
What did I tell you about that?

42:05.828 --> 42:07.128
Where are you trying to go?

42:07.129 --> 42:08.762
Where are you...? Where?
Where? Where? Go ahead.

42:09.188 --> 42:10.571
Do you want me to shoot you?

42:10.780 --> 42:12.163
Stop. Just stop.

42:24.495 --> 42:26.349
How's this on the other side?

42:31.584 --> 42:32.412
Hey.

42:38.842 --> 42:40.131
What, uh... What is this?

42:43.700 --> 42:45.441
Three nights at the Kahala Hotel.

42:45.759 --> 42:47.022
Look, I know you're
gonna say no...

42:47.023 --> 42:48.462
Yeah. You're right,
I'm gonna say no.

42:48.463 --> 42:50.173
What is it with you and
my living arrangements?

42:50.174 --> 42:51.872
Gracie's coming over
this weekend, right?

42:52.566 --> 42:53.652
Yeah. Okay.

42:53.653 --> 42:54.804
So, I hear this place has a pool,

42:54.805 --> 42:57.044
you can swim with the dolphins.
Just take it.

42:57.045 --> 42:58.004
Hey.

43:00.742 --> 43:01.866
Oh, you look, uh...

43:01.867 --> 43:03.035
You look really bad.

43:05.636 --> 43:06.639
Thank you.

43:07.787 --> 43:08.898
You're welcome.

43:09.223 --> 43:10.205
Thank you.

43:15.311 --> 43:17.860
Okay, guys, honestly,
I think we need a name.

43:18.246 --> 43:18.676
A name?

43:18.677 --> 43:19.164
What kind of name?

43:19.165 --> 43:19.810
What are you talking about?

43:19.811 --> 43:21.454
Yeah, like, something
to call ourselves.

43:21.455 --> 43:23.691
What do you think?
Why do we need a name?

43:23.692 --> 43:26.474
Because we're gonna be working
together, and it'd be cool.

43:26.475 --> 43:27.375
I got it.

43:29.244 --> 43:31.823
A'ohe hana nui ka alu'ia.

43:34.872 --> 43:36.567
You, too. What?

43:36.568 --> 43:38.111
What are you laughing at? Come on.

43:38.112 --> 43:42.231
That means, "No task is too
big when done together."

43:43.697 --> 43:44.506
This is the problem

43:44.507 --> 43:46.922
with you haoles... no team spirit.

43:46.923 --> 43:47.810
No island spirit.

43:47.811 --> 43:48.697
No, honestly. Come on.

43:48.698 --> 43:50.602
Be something cool
like Strike Force.

43:50.603 --> 43:51.247
Strike Force?

43:51.248 --> 43:52.039
Yes. Strike Force.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.253
I hate that so much.

43:53.254 --> 43:55.808
You know, I say we keep thinking.
