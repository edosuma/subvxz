00:00.476 --> 00:02.158
Previously on Saving Hope...

00:02.208 --> 00:03.341
Come on, Maggie. Talk to me.

00:03.343 --> 00:05.543
Maggie?
Maggie, what just happened?

00:05.545 --> 00:06.677
- Are you okay?
- Really, Zach, I'm fine.

00:06.679 --> 00:07.678
Okay, this is Shelby.

00:07.680 --> 00:08.746
- Where's my husband?
- She's pregnant.

00:08.748 --> 00:10.447
She has a bad laceration on her leg

00:10.449 --> 00:11.548
and probably some kind of shrapnel.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.283
We're gonna do everything in our power

00:13.285 --> 00:14.684
to make sure the baby is healthy.

00:14.686 --> 00:16.186
You are compromising the sterile environment

00:16.187 --> 00:17.487
of my patient.

00:17.489 --> 00:18.788
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- I am the police.

00:18.790 --> 00:20.858
And your patient is the damn bomber.

00:20.860 --> 00:23.593
You're operating on the bomber
when innocent people are hurt!

00:23.595 --> 00:25.795
I need you find out if it belongs
to anybody who's been admitted.

00:25.797 --> 00:27.164
It's a young woman's arm.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.232
Please. I'm looking for my daughter.

00:28.234 --> 00:29.566
She was in the run today.

00:29.568 --> 00:31.868
Lane didn't have anything
to do with those, did he?

00:31.870 --> 00:33.069
When this crisis is done,

00:33.071 --> 00:34.737
I'd like to have a word
with you on another matter.

00:34.739 --> 00:36.105
Okay, can I ask you what it's about?

00:36.107 --> 00:37.874
A sexual assault.

00:37.876 --> 00:39.775
Moving forward, it's gonna
be best for the hospital

00:39.777 --> 00:42.478
if you just, uh, keep your mouth shut.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.646
Should I send someone to look for Dr. Lin?

00:44.648 --> 00:46.548
No, she probably got caught
up with another patient,

00:46.550 --> 00:47.783
and either way, this can't wait.

00:47.785 --> 00:48.985
You ready to deliver a baby?

00:48.987 --> 00:49.886
Let's do it.

00:49.888 --> 00:51.453
Aah.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:07.003 --> 01:08.970
Maggie.

01:08.972 --> 01:12.340
Charlie? You can see me?

01:12.342 --> 01:14.242
What happened?

01:14.244 --> 01:16.412
- Maggie, where are you?
- Charlie.

01:16.414 --> 01:18.647
They need you for a consult in the O.R.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.549
Zach.

01:20.551 --> 01:21.617
Where's Maggie?

01:21.619 --> 01:23.885
I don't know. In the O.R., I think.

01:32.361 --> 01:35.162
Dr. Bishop, I think you
should have a look at this.

01:35.164 --> 01:37.264
Why?

01:37.266 --> 01:38.999
Blood pressure's stabilized.

01:39.001 --> 01:41.135
The bleeding's under control.
We've delivered the baby.

01:41.137 --> 01:42.303
I'm talking about the leg.

01:42.305 --> 01:44.438
I'm not liking
the look of the tissue here.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.972
Good catch, Sekara.

01:45.974 --> 01:47.441
All right, mark the swelling,

01:47.443 --> 01:49.409
and let's finish this up before
we give ortho another call.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.479
Charlie. Speak of the devil.

01:52.481 --> 01:53.847
Hey, where's Maggie?
Isn't she supposed to be in here?

01:54.259 --> 01:56.215
She went to get clotting factors
from the third-floor lab.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.784
Why?

02:00.655 --> 02:02.021
Jackson, I'm headed to the lab.

02:02.023 --> 02:03.356
Send a code team after me.

02:03.358 --> 02:05.559
Dr. Harris, what's going on?

02:05.561 --> 02:07.693
Code blue, third-floor lab.

02:08.608 --> 02:09.595
Maggie.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.130
Code blue, third-floor lab.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.138
Pulse is thready. Give her mannitol.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.141
Let's go, let's go!

02:23.143 --> 02:24.710
Pupils are dilated.

02:32.551 --> 02:34.385
- Zach.
- Yes?

02:34.387 --> 02:36.721
Hey, look what the Katz dragged in.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.389
Wow. I forgot how funny you are.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.557
Picked a hell of a day to make a comeback.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.959
Tell me about it.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.327
A patient of mine, Shelby Hart,
she was in the bombing.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.730
I got a call she was rushed
in for an emergency section.

02:45.732 --> 02:46.865
Yeah, she's up in the O.R. right now.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.966
Now? Okay, I need to see her.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.333
Where's Shahir? He needs to be down here.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.234
Maggie! Oh, my God!

02:50.236 --> 02:51.735
You go. Find your patient.

02:51.737 --> 02:54.405
I've got her. If anything happens,
I'll let you know.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.240
Okay.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.274
Where'd you find her?

02:57.276 --> 02:59.010
Lab. Don't know long she was there.

02:59.012 --> 02:59.943
What the hell happened?

02:59.945 --> 03:01.045
She was in the bombing.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.113
She was working?

03:02.115 --> 03:03.614
Yes, I assessed her for concussion.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.516
Everything checked out, Charlie.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.683
You didn't do anything wrong, Zach.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.352
Oh, tell her that.
Let's get her up to imaging.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.121
I don't know if there's time.
Where's Shahir?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.287
I'm right here. Can I see her, please?

03:11.289 --> 03:12.889
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.691
Epidural hematoma?

03:15.693 --> 03:17.027
Yes, I'm afraid so.

03:17.029 --> 03:18.328
Okay, let's get her up to
pictures and then the O.R.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.762
We only have minutes before
there's permanent damage.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.197
Hey, hey. What happened to her?

03:21.199 --> 03:22.532
She has a brain bleed, Alex.

03:22.534 --> 03:24.134
Hopefully Charlie found her in time,

03:24.136 --> 03:25.868
but I'll know more once I open her up.

03:25.870 --> 03:26.969
She's gonna be okay, Alex.

03:26.971 --> 03:28.571
She's gonna be okay.

03:28.573 --> 03:29.605
You keep saying that.

03:29.607 --> 03:31.207
How did you know where to find her?

03:32.743 --> 03:34.376
Right.

03:36.013 --> 03:37.112
Oh, my God, Charlie.

03:37.114 --> 03:39.148
I saved the guy who did this to her.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.324
Do you know how long
she was deprived of oxygen?

03:50.326 --> 03:52.660
I'd just be guessing at this point.

03:52.662 --> 03:55.062
I suppose it is just guesswork
until she lives or dies.

03:55.778 --> 03:58.465
Wow. Your bedside manner's
really improved, Shahir.

03:58.467 --> 04:01.769
I think this is an instance
where emotional detachment

04:01.771 --> 04:03.270
works to our advantage, don't you think?

04:03.272 --> 04:04.304
Whatever.

04:04.306 --> 04:05.773
Charlie.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.107
I love her, too.

04:07.109 --> 04:09.810
I just... I just have a
different way of showing it.

04:09.812 --> 04:10.778
Right.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.545
You paged me to assist?

04:12.547 --> 04:14.546
Yes, I did. Scrub up, Dr. Sekara.

04:14.548 --> 04:16.149
Good luck, guys.

04:25.425 --> 04:27.393
Maggie, talk to me.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.165
I think I was operating.

04:35.568 --> 04:40.806
My patient, Shelby Hart, she's pregnant.

04:40.808 --> 04:43.642
She hurt her leg, I think.

04:43.644 --> 04:46.211
Maggie, Maggie. Look at me.

04:46.213 --> 04:47.613
You're very sick, okay?

04:47.615 --> 04:49.715
No, I don't feel sick.

04:49.717 --> 04:51.517
I feel... weird.

04:51.519 --> 04:53.185
That's because you're a ghost.

04:54.621 --> 04:56.689
But it also means
I can help you, okay, so...

04:56.691 --> 04:58.691
so you need to tell me what you need.

04:58.693 --> 05:02.961
I need to be with my patient.

05:02.963 --> 05:04.529
I abandoned her in the O.R.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.336
Hey.

05:11.338 --> 05:12.204
Hi.

05:13.473 --> 05:15.340
I heard about Maggie.

05:15.342 --> 05:16.507
Yeah.

05:16.509 --> 05:18.844
Uh, she'll pull through. She has to.

05:18.846 --> 05:20.178
What's that?

05:20.180 --> 05:23.215
This is Shelby's leg half an hour ago.

05:24.984 --> 05:26.384
That's it now.

05:26.386 --> 05:28.053
In a half an hour?

05:28.055 --> 05:29.921
We have to amputate.

05:29.923 --> 05:31.223
Is that what ortho said?

05:31.225 --> 05:32.257
That's what I say.

05:32.259 --> 05:33.658
Look, I know
what dead tissue looks like.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.260
If we don't move fast,
the infection will spread.

05:35.262 --> 05:36.494
Yeah, and it could kill her.

05:36.496 --> 05:39.163
The explosive was probably
made in someone's basement

05:39.165 --> 05:40.731
with instructions from the internet.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.099
What a good news day.

05:42.101 --> 05:43.834
Look, you're the one
with vascular experience,

05:43.836 --> 05:45.702
but if you want me to take this,
just say the word.

05:46.352 --> 05:47.404
No.

05:47.406 --> 05:49.478
She's Maggie's patient. I've got this.

05:49.528 --> 05:51.342
Thanks, though.

05:59.173 --> 06:01.484
Oh, my God.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.119
Dr. Katz.

06:04.956 --> 06:06.122
Thank God you're here.

06:06.124 --> 06:08.258
It's good to see you, Adam.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.026
The baby?

06:10.028 --> 06:12.262
Well, she's small,

06:12.264 --> 06:14.931
but all things considered,
she's doing great.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.900
We just have to watch her
for respiratory problems.

06:16.902 --> 06:18.034
And Shelby?

06:18.036 --> 06:22.038
Let's take things one step at a time, okay?

06:22.040 --> 06:24.774
Give me a chance to check
in with her surgeon.

06:24.776 --> 06:27.175
Mr. Hart.

06:27.177 --> 06:28.677
How's she doing?

06:28.679 --> 06:31.714
I have some information
about your wife's condition,

06:31.716 --> 06:32.882
if you'll both come with me, please.

06:35.519 --> 06:37.219
The shrapnel damage is extensive.

06:37.221 --> 06:39.422
It's doubtful that
the leg will still be viable.

06:39.424 --> 06:41.323
What does that mean?

06:41.325 --> 06:43.058
We may have to amputate.

06:43.060 --> 06:44.894
What?

06:46.763 --> 06:49.164
No.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.499
You said she was gonna be okay.

06:50.501 --> 06:53.935
She will be. If we sacrifice the leg.

06:53.937 --> 06:55.470
What if you don't?

06:55.472 --> 06:57.238
Then the infection will spread quickly

06:57.240 --> 06:58.573
through your wife's body.

06:58.575 --> 07:02.276
Are you saying I might lose
both my wife and my baby today?

07:02.278 --> 07:03.945
No, that's what we're trying to prevent.

07:06.081 --> 07:08.349
I went to the race this
morning to cheer my wife on...

07:08.351 --> 07:09.517
And now this?

07:09.519 --> 07:11.820
I am so sorry.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.922
I will be back as soon as I can, all right?

07:13.924 --> 07:15.757
Is it Maggie?

07:15.759 --> 07:17.859
No, another patient.

07:17.861 --> 07:20.094
What's wrong?

07:20.096 --> 07:24.364
Oh, one of the doctors who works
here was injured in the blast.

07:24.366 --> 07:26.500
Dr. Lin?
The one that helped Shelby?

07:26.502 --> 07:28.502
Yeah.

07:28.504 --> 07:30.904
Is she gonna be okay?

07:30.906 --> 07:33.306
We don't know yet.

07:33.308 --> 07:34.274
Here you go.

07:36.377 --> 07:37.444
Dr. Miller?

07:37.446 --> 07:38.846
What is it, Cassie? I'm busy.

07:38.848 --> 07:40.848
Uh, he came looking for his
daughter after the bombing,

07:40.850 --> 07:42.248
and I just found her in the morgue.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.784
She's the girl that's arm was severed.

07:43.786 --> 07:44.818
You're sure?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.855
Okay.

07:50.324 --> 07:51.724
You got to tell him.

07:51.726 --> 07:53.726
Well, what if I don't know how to do that?

07:53.728 --> 07:56.062
You tell the truth, Dr. Williams.

07:56.064 --> 07:59.665
As painful as it is,
it's the easiest thing to remember.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.034
Finish what you started.

08:16.049 --> 08:18.083
My... my daughter? Have you found her?

08:18.085 --> 08:20.185
Can we speak in the hallway, please?

08:22.522 --> 08:23.522
What's wrong?

08:23.524 --> 08:25.357
I...

08:25.359 --> 08:26.691
Tell me.

08:30.696 --> 08:32.998
She didn't make it.

08:33.000 --> 08:33.932
I'm so sorry.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.366
I'm sorry.

08:36.369 --> 08:37.368
Sh-she's...

08:37.370 --> 08:39.571
She died in the bombing.

08:41.106 --> 08:42.407
No.

08:42.409 --> 08:43.542
No, no, this can't... no.

08:43.544 --> 08:44.543
- Judging by her injuries...
- No.

08:44.545 --> 08:47.145
I don't think she was in any pain.

08:49.048 --> 08:50.415
What were her injuries?

08:52.653 --> 08:54.686
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:54.688 --> 08:57.522
Why?

08:58.591 --> 08:59.591
Why would they do this?

08:59.593 --> 09:00.859
Why would anyone hurt my little girl?

09:09.702 --> 09:10.701
With the blast lung,

09:10.703 --> 09:12.436
Mr. Doe's gonna need constant monitoring.

09:12.438 --> 09:14.672
They've just identified him on the internet.

09:14.674 --> 09:16.574
He's not John Doe anymore.

09:16.576 --> 09:18.075
What's his name?

09:18.077 --> 09:19.109
Michael Schneller.

09:19.111 --> 09:21.445
He's a first-year engineering student.

09:21.447 --> 09:24.281
No criminal record, no history of violence.

09:24.283 --> 09:25.282
It's weird, huh?

09:25.284 --> 09:27.651
Page me if there are any changes.

09:27.653 --> 09:29.086
Of course.

09:32.958 --> 09:35.758
Susan Park to the nurses' station.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.426
Susan Park to the nurses' station.

09:39.396 --> 09:40.763
Hold this in place, please.

09:40.765 --> 09:41.931
- Asha.
- Yeah?

09:41.933 --> 09:43.299
- Will you cover for me?
- Sure.

09:43.301 --> 09:44.467
Is everything okay?

09:45.970 --> 09:47.003
How's that?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.475
Detective.

09:53.477 --> 09:55.611
Yeah?

09:55.613 --> 09:57.245
Is this a good time?

09:57.247 --> 09:59.815
It's as good as any.

10:01.951 --> 10:04.686
I don't like the word...

10:04.688 --> 10:06.655
but I'm the victim.

10:06.657 --> 10:08.757
Yeah, I kind of guessed that.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.325
Can you tell me about it?

10:15.130 --> 10:16.631
It was violent.

10:19.601 --> 10:22.503
Non-consensual.

10:22.505 --> 10:25.272
Was it a stranger or someone you knew?

10:25.274 --> 10:27.508
I know him.

10:27.510 --> 10:29.443
We were involved.

10:29.445 --> 10:30.911
How long ago?

10:34.282 --> 10:35.715
Almost a month.

10:40.688 --> 10:42.556
I'll be honest with you.
That makes things tough.

10:43.892 --> 10:46.360
Times have changed,
but not as much as you'd think.

10:46.362 --> 10:49.296
I hate to say it, but he-said,
she-said almost never works

10:49.298 --> 10:50.364
in favor of the victim.

10:50.366 --> 10:51.798
I know.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.168
I will take this wherever you decide.

10:54.170 --> 10:55.235
All right?

10:55.237 --> 10:57.936
There's a few things
that I have to deal with

10:57.938 --> 11:00.005
before I pull the trigger on it.

11:02.209 --> 11:03.643
Thanks for listening.

11:03.645 --> 11:05.645
You say the word,

11:05.647 --> 11:07.213
I'll do a hell of a lot more than that.

11:22.428 --> 11:23.728
Mr. Kelehar.

11:25.164 --> 11:26.164
Don't do this.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.765
He took my little girl.

11:27.767 --> 11:30.335
This won't bring her back.

11:30.337 --> 11:31.869
It'll only ruin your life.

11:31.871 --> 11:34.972
My life's already over.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.043
Cassie, who is this?

11:39.045 --> 11:42.080
This is Mr. Kelehar.

11:42.082 --> 11:43.248
He lost his daughter in the bombing.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.616
Lily! her name was Lily!

11:45.618 --> 11:46.751
Sir, please.

11:46.753 --> 11:49.754
I don't want to hurt you. I want him.

11:49.756 --> 11:51.756
Put the knife down.

11:51.758 --> 11:54.291
She was a good girl.

11:55.794 --> 11:57.228
So strong.

11:57.230 --> 11:58.763
Mr. Kelehar.

11:58.765 --> 12:00.397
When she was 10,

12:00.399 --> 12:03.167
she lost her best friend to leukemia.

12:03.169 --> 12:05.903
Every year, she would
raise money in her memory.

12:05.905 --> 12:07.138
That's why she was out there running.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.273
She sounds like she was an amazing girl.

12:09.275 --> 12:10.841
She was.

12:10.843 --> 12:12.476
Big-hearted.

12:12.478 --> 12:13.744
Oh, the biggest.

12:14.630 --> 12:17.514
She wouldn't want anyone
else to get hurt today.

12:20.151 --> 12:21.585
But she's gone.

12:21.587 --> 12:23.153
I know.

12:23.155 --> 12:28.292
But for her, for Lily,

12:28.294 --> 12:32.696
in her memory, please don't do this.

12:32.698 --> 12:34.097
Please put the knife down.

12:48.312 --> 12:49.545
No.

12:49.547 --> 12:50.881
No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:51.917 --> 12:52.816
Applying pressure.

12:54.318 --> 12:56.119
Security!

12:56.121 --> 12:57.821
Get me some gauze. Call security.

12:57.823 --> 12:59.156
Let's go!

13:00.444 --> 13:02.210
Your baby's heart rate is good.

13:02.212 --> 13:03.445
Blood pressure, too.

13:03.447 --> 13:05.280
So far, we're not seeing any side effects

13:05.282 --> 13:06.815
from the trauma you've suffered.

13:06.817 --> 13:09.217
Thank you.

13:09.219 --> 13:10.886
Adam says you want to take my leg.

13:10.888 --> 13:14.555
We need to get you in the
O.R. as soon as possible.

13:14.557 --> 13:15.823
We can get a second opinion.

13:15.825 --> 13:17.892
If you take my leg, I'll live.

13:17.894 --> 13:18.926
Yes.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.396
Then do it.

13:23.665 --> 13:27.668
The only thing that
matters is the baby, Adam.

13:27.670 --> 13:30.171
I'm gonna name her Rosie.

13:30.173 --> 13:31.339
Rosie, after my mom.

13:33.109 --> 13:35.643
I want to see her.

13:35.645 --> 13:37.278
I want to see my baby before
I go into surgery, okay?

13:37.280 --> 13:39.580
Of course. We will make that happen.

13:39.582 --> 13:41.082
Okay.

13:48.556 --> 13:50.224
I need to go over her imaging one more time

13:50.226 --> 13:51.625
before I make the cut,
so why don't I page you

13:51.627 --> 13:52.692
before I bring her into the O.R.?

13:52.694 --> 13:53.660
Okay.

13:57.732 --> 13:59.466
What happened?

13:59.468 --> 14:01.535
A father of one of the victims cut himself

14:01.537 --> 14:03.103
in front of Cassie and me.

14:03.105 --> 14:04.071
Jesus, Alex.

14:04.073 --> 14:06.105
He was trying to kill my patient.

14:06.107 --> 14:07.073
You okay?

14:08.609 --> 14:09.608
Hey.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.844
- Hey!
- What?

14:11.846 --> 14:13.046
None of this is your fault.

14:15.516 --> 14:17.083
You said you saw Maggie?

14:17.085 --> 14:18.984
Yeah.

14:18.986 --> 14:23.156
Tell her she has to live.

14:23.158 --> 14:24.757
Please.

14:39.405 --> 14:40.639
Maggie.

14:40.641 --> 14:42.207
When you do the amputation,

14:42.209 --> 14:44.276
make sure you check her vascular
return every two minutes.

14:44.278 --> 14:45.644
I know.

14:45.646 --> 14:48.513
And have Baumann give her the
minimum amount of clot busters.

14:48.515 --> 14:49.748
- Maggie.
- She just had a C-section.

14:49.750 --> 14:50.849
We can't have her hemorrhaging.

14:50.851 --> 14:52.818
Maggie!

14:52.820 --> 14:55.854
Shelby's stable. Her baby's fine.

14:55.856 --> 15:01.093
You, however, are still... in this state.

15:01.987 --> 15:03.695
So? What does that mean?

15:03.697 --> 15:06.098
It means maybe you should
stop worrying about Shelby

15:06.100 --> 15:07.765
and start
worrying about yourself.

15:07.767 --> 15:09.834
You don't understand.

15:09.836 --> 15:11.603
Oh, I understand.

15:11.605 --> 15:13.205
I understand that
right after the explosion,

15:13.207 --> 15:14.539
you went straight into doctor mode,

15:14.541 --> 15:15.873
and started worrying about everybody else

15:15.875 --> 15:17.175
and not worrying about you.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.544
I had no choice.

15:19.546 --> 15:20.778
My patients needed me.

15:20.780 --> 15:24.449
Yeah. And now you're a ghost.

15:30.578 --> 15:32.389
Unlike the rest of the body,

15:32.391 --> 15:35.025
the brain and the spinal
cord heal unpredictably.

15:35.027 --> 15:37.528
If a neurosurgeon makes one mistake,

15:37.530 --> 15:38.929
the damage can be permanent.

15:38.931 --> 15:39.963
Is that clear?

15:39.965 --> 15:40.864
Crystal.

15:40.866 --> 15:44.067
- But, Dr. Hamza...
- Yes?

15:44.069 --> 15:47.138
Isn't this a conflict, operating on Dr. Lin?

15:47.140 --> 15:48.506
If there's five seconds left on the clock

15:48.508 --> 15:49.507
and the game is on the line,

15:49.509 --> 15:51.207
do you want the ball or not?

15:51.209 --> 15:52.675
It depends.

15:52.677 --> 15:55.845
That's why I'm operating...
because I always want the ball.

15:55.847 --> 15:58.714
I wouldn't have figured
you for a basketball fan.

15:58.716 --> 16:00.049
Once my boyfriend explained that the game

16:00.051 --> 16:03.253
is more about trigonometry
and physics, I was hooked.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.889
Did you ever consider pursuing
neurosurgery, Dr. Sekara?

16:06.891 --> 16:08.558
Uh, no, I haven't.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.560
Yeah, well, it's not for everyone.

16:15.998 --> 16:17.999
Our first guest.

16:18.001 --> 16:19.868
I imagine we'll have many more.

16:21.704 --> 16:23.205
How do you stay so calm?

16:23.207 --> 16:26.275
I'm not calm, Dr. Sekara.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.278
I'm just focused.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.246
Dr. Lin requires that of me.
So does everyone else.

16:32.248 --> 16:34.683
You know, they require that of you, as well.

16:36.385 --> 16:38.720
Okay. Let's alleviate the
pressure of the oculomotor nerve

16:38.722 --> 16:39.620
and the brain stem.

16:39.622 --> 16:41.589
Scissors, thank you.

16:47.029 --> 16:48.429
Will they arrest me?

16:50.399 --> 16:51.432
I don't know.

16:53.468 --> 16:55.970
I wish I could say no, but I can't.

16:55.972 --> 16:59.573
You'll have to assessed by a
psychiatrist when I'm done here.

17:01.943 --> 17:03.310
I'm sorry.

17:07.415 --> 17:09.782
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

17:12.954 --> 17:14.954
Do they need me to identify her body?

17:22.030 --> 17:24.731
Will she be broken?

17:32.110 --> 17:33.806
Jackson, I am free, able,
and willing to serve.

17:33.808 --> 17:35.208
Who's next in line?

17:35.210 --> 17:37.944
Great. We got over in the...

17:37.946 --> 17:39.446
You know, hold that thought.

17:56.163 --> 17:57.719
Please. Just leave me alone.

17:57.769 --> 17:58.928
Sorry.

17:59.615 --> 18:01.388
I can't.

18:03.071 --> 18:06.005
You've had an awful, awful day.

18:06.007 --> 18:07.506
We all have.

18:08.979 --> 18:11.644
He loved her so much.

18:14.014 --> 18:15.514
It never gets easier.

18:19.452 --> 18:21.920
What kind of comfort are you?

18:23.324 --> 18:25.157
Not much.

18:26.859 --> 18:28.294
I'm not much of a hugger, either, but...

18:43.176 --> 18:45.576
There's a small amount of
blood in the ventricle.

18:45.578 --> 18:48.651
Let's make sure we monitor that post-op.

18:49.949 --> 18:52.049
Focus on the task at hand.

18:52.051 --> 18:53.584
I was focusing.

18:53.586 --> 18:55.953
Now you're just making me nervous.

18:55.955 --> 18:57.355
I'm sorry. I do that.

18:57.357 --> 18:59.857
How long you worked with Dr. Lin?

18:59.859 --> 19:01.826
Since she was a resident.

19:01.828 --> 19:02.860
And you like her.

19:02.862 --> 19:05.229
Yes, of course.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.631
So does everyone else.

19:07.633 --> 19:08.833
That's why they're all up there.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.337
Yeah, she just always seemed
a little serious to me.

19:13.339 --> 19:17.107
She's worked hard to be
the surgeon that she is.

19:17.109 --> 19:21.045
What if... what if she
can't be a doctor anymore?

19:21.047 --> 19:24.681
There's no point in thinking
about that right now.

19:24.683 --> 19:25.950
We won't know until she wakes up

19:25.952 --> 19:29.219
if there's any lasting
cognitive deficits, okay?

19:29.221 --> 19:30.620
Back to work.

19:33.359 --> 19:34.891
How is she?

19:36.961 --> 19:40.364
I have no idea. Shahir hasn't
given me an update yet.

19:40.366 --> 19:41.698
How are you?

19:45.135 --> 19:47.371
I cleared her for work,
and I shouldn't have.

19:47.373 --> 19:49.740
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

19:49.742 --> 19:52.609
I saved the life of the
guy who did this to her.

19:52.611 --> 19:54.310
It doesn't.

19:57.415 --> 19:58.448
But thanks.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.618
So, do I win the guilt-off?

20:02.620 --> 20:05.755
Sure.

20:05.757 --> 20:09.458
What's my prize?

20:09.460 --> 20:10.459
Maggie pulls through.

20:10.461 --> 20:12.061
Dr. Reid?

20:12.063 --> 20:13.696
Hi. Yes, what is it?

20:13.698 --> 20:14.964
Your patient, the bomber.

20:14.966 --> 20:16.132
What about him?

20:16.134 --> 20:17.633
His blood P.H. is way off.

20:17.635 --> 20:21.170
We need you right now.

20:21.172 --> 20:22.872
Can I have his chart.

20:22.874 --> 20:24.507
Talk to me.

20:24.509 --> 20:26.009
B.P. is low and dropping.

20:26.011 --> 20:28.177
- Any urine in the bag?
- None.

20:28.179 --> 20:30.346
A.B.G.s look terrible.

20:30.348 --> 20:34.182
There's no family present.

20:34.184 --> 20:36.018
All right, then.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.520
Detective.

20:39.255 --> 20:41.457
Can you take off his handcuffs, please?

20:41.459 --> 20:43.492
- Dr. Reid.
- Just do it.

20:54.571 --> 20:55.771
That'll be all, thanks.

20:55.773 --> 20:58.841
At least someone got what they wanted today.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.545
What would you like me to do?

21:03.547 --> 21:06.781
Take him off the vent.

21:39.229 --> 21:40.208
Of course, yep.

21:40.270 --> 21:42.206
If any of the board members
have any questions,

21:42.208 --> 21:43.940
just have them contact me directly.

21:45.910 --> 21:47.545
Okay, till then.

21:47.547 --> 21:49.280
You asked to see me, Dr. Bell?

21:49.282 --> 21:50.881
Yeah. Come on in, Asha.

21:50.883 --> 21:51.948
Have a seat.

21:51.950 --> 21:54.618
I'm fine. Just busy.

21:54.620 --> 21:57.854
It's been a brutal day.

21:57.856 --> 22:00.557
So I'll just get right to the point.

22:00.559 --> 22:03.193
I'm gonna press charges against
Lane for sexual assault.

22:03.195 --> 22:06.329
Why are you telling me this?

22:06.331 --> 22:07.763
Because you're with him now.

22:07.765 --> 22:09.632
And I wanted you to know ahead of time.

22:09.634 --> 22:11.133
'Cause you're hoping I'll back you up

22:11.135 --> 22:12.368
and make it two against one.

22:12.370 --> 22:13.603
Well, I'm not gonna deny

22:13.605 --> 22:15.771
that it would be a better case against him

22:15.773 --> 22:16.706
if you came forward.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.508
- I already told you...
- I know.

22:18.510 --> 22:20.410
You don't remember
where you got your bruises.

22:20.412 --> 22:23.279
That's... that is your business.

22:23.281 --> 22:25.815
I'm not gonna pressure you.
That's not my style.

22:25.817 --> 22:28.050
Lane's told me about your style.

22:28.052 --> 22:30.386
Pardon me?

22:30.388 --> 22:33.022
You don't get to the top without
stepping on someone along the way,

22:33.024 --> 22:34.389
and I get it.

22:34.391 --> 22:37.226
I'm not jeopardizing my career
just so you can get back at him.

22:37.228 --> 22:39.729
Asha.

22:42.298 --> 22:44.967
I know what Lane did to me,

22:44.969 --> 22:49.671
and I'm gonna stop him from
doing it to somebody else.

22:49.673 --> 22:51.107
It could get ugly.

22:51.109 --> 22:52.908
I just want you to be
prepared for the fallout.

23:02.652 --> 23:04.452
You should go home.

23:04.454 --> 23:05.419
I will.

23:05.421 --> 23:07.521
Just need to do something first.

23:07.523 --> 23:08.556
What's that?

23:08.558 --> 23:11.525
It doesn't matter.

23:11.527 --> 23:13.494
It's kind of crazy, actually.

23:13.496 --> 23:16.064
I'm okay with crazy.

23:16.066 --> 23:18.833
I'm good, thanks.

23:18.835 --> 23:20.802
Good night.

23:31.813 --> 23:33.180
You paged me?

23:33.182 --> 23:35.750
Yeah, uh, I'll-I'll fill you in

23:35.752 --> 23:37.551
on the way down to the O.R.

23:37.553 --> 23:40.721
Shelby's just down there
getting prepped, and...

23:40.723 --> 23:43.824
I lost my patient... the one
that I went to the wall to save,

23:43.826 --> 23:47.561
the one who is responsible
for this whole nightmare.

23:49.765 --> 23:50.898
I'm sorry.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.833
Don't be. He wanted to die.

23:52.835 --> 23:54.268
I should have let him.

23:54.270 --> 23:57.337
Hey.

23:57.339 --> 23:58.839
Alex, you know you couldn't do that.

24:03.478 --> 24:06.079
It's, uh, Zach.
Maggie's surgery is almost done.

24:06.081 --> 24:08.081
I'll meet you down there.

24:17.159 --> 24:20.393
I love you, Rosie.

24:20.395 --> 24:22.429
More than anything.

24:22.431 --> 24:24.531
You'll be back to see her soon.

24:24.533 --> 24:29.469
You and your family are in great
hands with Dr. Harris, Shelby.

24:45.453 --> 24:48.355
I hear you've been harassing my girlfriend.

24:48.357 --> 24:50.857
I'm not doing this with you.

24:50.859 --> 24:52.659
You're in over your head.
you know that, don't you?

24:52.661 --> 24:56.028
I've already contacted the police.

24:56.030 --> 25:00.332
And painted a very sympathetic
portrait of yourself, I'm sure.

25:00.786 --> 25:03.068
I just wonder if everybody
else is gonna see Dawn Bell

25:03.070 --> 25:06.805
the same way that you see Dawn Bell.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.374
We both know what you did to me.

25:08.376 --> 25:11.977
Sweet Dawn Bell...
a brilliant cardiac surgeon,

25:11.979 --> 25:13.245
but also an abuse victim.

25:13.247 --> 25:18.417
Or how about Dr. Bell...
a vindictive jilted lover?

25:18.419 --> 25:20.285
- You are not gonna make this my fault.
- Oh, no.

25:20.287 --> 25:21.653
This is the same woman who fought

25:21.655 --> 25:25.090
to pull the plug on her
husband while he was in a coma

25:25.092 --> 25:26.692
because he started seeing another woman...

25:26.694 --> 25:28.159
A much younger woman.

25:28.161 --> 25:30.128
You are cruel.

25:30.130 --> 25:31.229
Ambitious Dr. Bell,

25:31.231 --> 25:33.365
who abandoned her own foster child

25:33.367 --> 25:37.369
because she couldn't bear to spend
time away from her precious work.

25:37.371 --> 25:39.938
I fought for her. They wouldn't let me.

25:39.940 --> 25:42.607
- You know that.
- Maybe.

25:42.609 --> 25:46.744
It's just all a different
way of seeing things, Dawn.

25:46.746 --> 25:52.150
Don't forget. This is what I do.

25:52.152 --> 25:53.484
Doing P.R. for this hospital

25:53.486 --> 25:57.555
means that I've been privy
to every move you've made

25:57.557 --> 26:01.026
to get you exactly where you are right now.

26:01.028 --> 26:03.461
Are you sure you want all
that out there in the open?

26:03.463 --> 26:07.198
I'm not afraid of you.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.234
Well, maybe you should be.

26:49.988 --> 26:52.990
You really love her, don't you?

26:52.992 --> 26:55.726
Dr. Reid. I need you to come with me.

26:55.728 --> 26:57.328
I'm about to operate, detective.

26:57.330 --> 26:58.996
It'll only take a minute.

27:00.218 --> 27:01.581
All right.

27:11.462 --> 27:13.714
This is Clarice Schneller.

27:13.746 --> 27:14.745
Michael was her son.

27:15.969 --> 27:18.081
The detective tells me

27:18.083 --> 27:20.884
you did all that you could for Michael,

27:20.886 --> 27:25.422
that you treated him just
like every other patient.

27:25.424 --> 27:27.557
Thank you.

27:27.559 --> 27:31.661
I don't know how I'll live
with myself for what he did.

27:33.797 --> 27:38.901
What he did was monstrous,
but he wasn't a monster.

27:38.903 --> 27:40.836
Believe me.

27:40.838 --> 27:45.074
He was sick.
He had these psychotic episodes.

27:45.076 --> 27:47.276
Was he being treated?

27:47.278 --> 27:48.610
For a while.

27:48.612 --> 27:51.713
But they switched his medication.

27:51.715 --> 27:54.283
Things got worse.

27:54.285 --> 27:58.220
There were voices in his
head telling him what to do.

27:58.222 --> 28:02.558
I didn't get him help in time.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.327
It's all so wrong.

28:05.329 --> 28:08.196
So cruel. And wrong.

28:09.199 --> 28:12.000
It's okay.

28:12.002 --> 28:14.169
I'll-I'll stay with her.

28:14.171 --> 28:15.871
You go help someone else.

28:17.037 --> 28:18.941
Come. Here, have a seat.

28:18.943 --> 28:21.843
It's all right.

28:24.246 --> 28:28.050
Hey. You all right?

28:28.052 --> 28:30.619
Uh, the mother of my patient.

28:30.621 --> 28:34.889
You mean the mother of the bomber?

28:34.891 --> 28:36.724
Alex, you don't have to do this surgery.

28:36.726 --> 28:39.493
Yeah, I do. It's the job, right?

28:41.263 --> 28:43.130
Hey. How is she?

28:43.132 --> 28:45.733
Stable for now.
We've done everything we could.

28:45.735 --> 28:46.834
Now we wait.

28:46.836 --> 28:49.169
Dr. Hamza, you're needed in O.R. six...

28:49.171 --> 28:52.473
another victim from the bombing.

28:52.475 --> 28:54.241
I'll stay with her.

28:54.243 --> 28:56.877
Thank you.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.414
There you are.

29:01.416 --> 29:03.016
Dr. Bishop, I'm...

29:03.018 --> 29:04.417
You're...?

29:04.419 --> 29:05.819
I'm sorry.

29:05.821 --> 29:10.957
I just wanted to soften the
blow for when her dad I.D.s her.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.492
It's pretty crazy. I told you.

29:14.428 --> 29:16.763
You're a kind person.

29:16.765 --> 29:19.532
What good is that gonna do me in this job?

29:19.534 --> 29:22.836
Some people think empathy gets
in the way of being a surgeon,

29:22.838 --> 29:26.305
but I think it's what
will make you a great one.

29:32.746 --> 29:33.812
What can I do to help?

29:44.625 --> 29:45.858
Some of the critically injured

29:45.860 --> 29:47.793
are being treated on
stretchers in the corridors.

29:47.795 --> 29:48.927
Can you check with central

29:48.929 --> 29:51.197
and see...

29:51.199 --> 29:52.331
Dawn?

29:52.333 --> 29:53.832
Dawn.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.369
I'm sorry. Can you say that again?

29:56.371 --> 29:58.537
We can't deal with the volume,

29:58.539 --> 30:00.139
and we need to move some of these patients.

30:00.141 --> 30:02.340
What, so we can make it
somebody else's problem?

30:02.342 --> 30:05.110
I'm just saying that
we're at a breaking point

30:05.112 --> 30:06.244
and we don't want to make any mistakes.

30:06.246 --> 30:08.881
I don't give a damn about reputation.

30:08.883 --> 30:10.983
I know you're overwhelmed. Everyone is.

30:10.985 --> 30:12.317
But this is our hospital,

30:12.319 --> 30:14.486
and these are our patients
whether we like it or not.

30:14.488 --> 30:17.690
And we are gonna push
through as best as we can,

30:17.692 --> 30:19.925
and we are not gonna stop
until every last patient

30:19.927 --> 30:21.760
gets exactly the care that they deserve.

30:21.762 --> 30:22.594
Got it?

30:22.596 --> 30:24.063
Yes, I do.

30:24.065 --> 30:26.665
I can count on you, right?

30:26.667 --> 30:28.067
Yes, you can.

30:31.837 --> 30:32.870
Asha.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.939
Just listen.

30:34.941 --> 30:37.108
Please.

30:37.110 --> 30:39.244
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you.

30:39.246 --> 30:41.279
That is your business.

30:41.281 --> 30:44.849
But you're not safe, okay? You're not.

30:44.851 --> 30:46.518
And I'm going forward with this.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.920
I don't care what it's gonna cost me.

30:48.922 --> 30:51.556
If you want to do a rotation
at another hospital,

30:51.558 --> 30:56.060
take some time off, whatever you need, okay?

30:56.062 --> 30:57.894
No questions asked. I've got your back.

31:15.413 --> 31:17.314
Good work, Charlie. Good and quick.

31:17.316 --> 31:25.288
Eh, no joy being the butcher,
but... it had to be done.

31:25.290 --> 31:29.559
This job is all I have, Charlie.

31:29.561 --> 31:31.227
What if I can't do it anymore?

31:31.229 --> 31:33.062
Try not to think about that now.

31:34.097 --> 31:37.199
I had a bleed in my brain.

31:37.201 --> 31:41.804
What if my memory's affected,
my decision making?

31:41.806 --> 31:43.439
What if I can't hold a scalpel anymore?

31:43.441 --> 31:46.742
Just take a deep breath.

31:46.744 --> 31:48.644
Calm down.

31:48.646 --> 31:53.214
I have spent my entire life
dedicated to this profession.

31:53.216 --> 31:54.783
And if it's taken away from me...

31:58.087 --> 32:01.256
Maggie.

32:06.763 --> 32:08.297
Dr. Sekara!

32:08.299 --> 32:09.331
What's wrong?

32:09.333 --> 32:10.565
She's in trouble.

32:10.567 --> 32:12.767
Page Shahir. We need him now.

32:14.937 --> 32:16.337
Charlie.

32:16.339 --> 32:19.307
Go to Maggie. Now.

32:23.879 --> 32:27.748
You need to fight.

32:27.750 --> 32:28.683
For your life.

32:28.685 --> 32:31.652
I have nothing to fight for.

32:31.654 --> 32:35.023
We love you, Maggie.

32:35.025 --> 32:38.558
That's worth fighting for.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.327
You all right, Charlie?

32:48.970 --> 32:50.103
Hey. Talk to me.

32:50.105 --> 32:50.971
What's going on?

32:50.973 --> 32:53.874
B.P.'s spiking. 165/110.

32:53.876 --> 32:55.242
Push fluids. Push everything.

32:55.244 --> 32:56.476
Alex, it's bad. Where's Shahir?

32:56.478 --> 32:58.312
Let me see the imaging.

32:58.314 --> 32:59.713
Was there blood in the fluid chambers?

32:59.715 --> 33:00.847
- The ventricles?
- A little.

33:00.849 --> 33:02.648
Dr. Hamza said we'd monitor it post-op.

33:02.650 --> 33:05.017
It must be blocking off her fluid outflow.

33:05.019 --> 33:08.354
Her brain is swelling.
She's got acute hydrocephalus.

33:08.356 --> 33:09.521
Dr. Hamza's in the middle
of another brain surgery.

33:09.523 --> 33:10.489
He's been paged.

33:10.491 --> 33:12.191
She'll be dead before he gets here!

33:12.193 --> 33:15.261
Get me a twist drill. Now.

33:26.940 --> 33:28.807
Passing the catheter into the ventricle.

33:32.912 --> 33:35.481
Alex...?

33:35.483 --> 33:37.315
I'm just putting in the ventricular drain.

33:37.317 --> 33:38.283
You should take over.

33:38.285 --> 33:41.019
Keep going. You're doing well.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.589
Maggie, we're all here.
We're all right beside you.

33:46.926 --> 33:49.961
You told me I should heal myself,

33:49.963 --> 33:55.299
but in order to treat someone,
you have to take a history.

33:55.301 --> 33:59.837
You have to know who they are.

33:59.839 --> 34:01.439
I don't know who I am.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.778
So how do I fix this?

34:06.780 --> 34:11.382
I don't know.
But wake up and find out.

34:33.471 --> 34:35.638
Am I okay?

34:38.676 --> 34:40.676
Lift your arms, palms up,

34:40.678 --> 34:43.679
like you're holding a double
goat cheese and anchovy pizza.

34:45.206 --> 34:47.482
I thought you'd never
mention that night again.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.620
Count back from 10.

34:52.621 --> 34:59.193
10, 9, 8... I think I got this one.

35:00.435 --> 35:02.764
It's good to have you back, Mags.

35:06.101 --> 35:07.669
Hey.

35:07.671 --> 35:09.604
Quit hogging that rock star.

35:09.606 --> 35:11.672
You look good.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.474
Welcome home, Dr. Lin.

35:13.476 --> 35:15.276
Thank you.

35:32.261 --> 35:33.564
Detective.

35:33.701 --> 35:36.497
I want to press charges against
a man named Lane Berkley.

35:36.499 --> 35:38.798
He's a member of the
board here at Hope Zion.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.367
He's the one who assaulted me.

35:40.369 --> 35:43.403
Okay.

35:43.405 --> 35:45.705
I'll take an impact statement from you

35:45.707 --> 35:46.973
then bring him in for questioning.

35:46.975 --> 35:49.142
We can do that in my office.
I'll see you there.

35:49.144 --> 35:52.412
Oh, and, Dr. Bell,

35:52.414 --> 35:54.680
you should know this is
the second time I've heard his name today.

35:58.192 --> 36:00.341
Someone's already come to you?

36:00.655 --> 36:02.755
I can't legally say any more.

36:02.757 --> 36:04.291
I'll see you in your office.

36:15.688 --> 36:17.469
Are you sure you want to do this?

36:17.471 --> 36:18.837
I did it, didn't I?

36:18.839 --> 36:19.838
You did.

36:21.391 --> 36:22.808
Why now?

36:26.146 --> 36:27.446
You should have seen the way he looked

36:27.448 --> 36:30.576
when he talked about what he
was gonna do to you in court.

36:31.185 --> 36:33.085
He wanted to burn you so badly.

36:34.473 --> 36:35.620
You were worried about me?

36:35.622 --> 36:37.288
I was worried about me.

36:38.332 --> 36:41.125
That's honest. I respect that.

36:41.127 --> 36:44.233
He burned me, too.
I have to tell the truth.

36:44.832 --> 36:47.466
So, what do you say we go do just that?

36:47.468 --> 36:49.103
Okay.

36:50.136 --> 36:52.604
She's so beautiful.

36:52.606 --> 36:54.973
Both of you are.

36:54.975 --> 36:57.609
We'll give you a moment.

36:57.611 --> 36:59.825
Can I hold Rosie, please?

37:00.860 --> 37:03.548
After today, all I want
to do is hold my baby.

37:03.550 --> 37:06.004
Soon. I swear.

37:06.078 --> 37:10.021
But, um, what you can
do is touch her.

37:41.754 --> 37:45.355
Thank you.

37:45.357 --> 37:47.024
She looks so peaceful.

37:50.061 --> 37:53.596
No pain.

38:40.844 --> 38:43.844
Lane Berkley.

38:43.846 --> 38:44.845
I need you to come with me.

39:06.069 --> 39:11.806
Dr. Katz, as I live and breathe.

39:11.808 --> 39:16.110
Well, I'm glad you're doing both.

39:16.112 --> 39:17.311
Can I come in?

39:17.313 --> 39:20.947
Well, if you're here to kiss me,
Alex beat you to it.

39:20.949 --> 39:25.586
Do tell.

39:27.755 --> 39:30.491
We were all
really worried about you.

39:32.193 --> 39:33.660
I thought...

39:33.662 --> 39:35.195
It's okay.

39:35.197 --> 39:37.063
I'm fine.

39:39.066 --> 39:41.468
You're in the I.C.U., Maggie.

39:41.470 --> 39:43.937
How could you possibly
make this glass half-full?

39:44.512 --> 39:46.473
Well, you're here.

39:49.877 --> 39:51.477
I am.

39:51.479 --> 39:53.747
So good to see you.

39:57.384 --> 40:01.287
My patient... Shelby Hart?

40:01.289 --> 40:03.189
Yeah, she's good. She's out of the woods.

40:03.191 --> 40:04.190
Baby, too.

40:04.192 --> 40:06.592
- That's great.
- Yeah.

40:06.594 --> 40:07.627
I'll keep you posted.

40:10.264 --> 40:12.465
I think I'll focus on myself for a while.

40:14.258 --> 40:16.770
That sounds like a plan.

40:20.697 --> 40:23.842
Ugh. I keep telling them
to lower the A.C. in here.

40:23.844 --> 40:25.911
I'll get you another blanket.

40:25.913 --> 40:28.214
Stay.

40:37.159 --> 40:40.560
Thank you.
It meant the world to him.

40:40.562 --> 40:42.228
I'm glad.

40:42.230 --> 40:43.396
You're welcome.

40:47.133 --> 40:48.500
Good night, Cassie.

40:48.502 --> 40:49.568
Good night.

41:05.384 --> 41:06.951
Hard to believe how quiet it is, huh?

41:06.953 --> 41:09.854
I like it.

41:09.856 --> 41:10.855
You know what the buddhists say?

41:10.857 --> 41:12.290
If you can't improve on silence...

41:12.292 --> 41:13.891
Amen to that.

41:13.893 --> 41:14.892
Night, Zach.

41:14.894 --> 41:16.928
Let's do it again tomorrow.

41:20.099 --> 41:21.099
Hey.

41:21.101 --> 41:22.867
Hi.

41:22.869 --> 41:25.302
Shall we?

41:25.304 --> 41:26.604
Actually, I'm gonna stay on.

41:26.606 --> 41:29.373
Are you sure you're okay to do that?

41:29.375 --> 41:32.110
Yes. You'll give Luke a kiss for me?

41:32.112 --> 41:34.178
I will.

41:34.180 --> 41:35.079
A couple.

41:37.616 --> 41:39.050
I love you.

41:39.052 --> 41:41.385
I know.
