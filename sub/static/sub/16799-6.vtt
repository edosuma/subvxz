WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.092
Previously on Elementary...
We're here to see Fiona
Helbron, aka Mittens.

00:04.130 --> 00:05.461
The day Phil was arrested,

00:05.500 --> 00:08.697
you walked me home, we talked,
and I liked it.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.239
Can we do it again?

00:11.270 --> 00:13.579
Relationships are hard for me.

00:13.610 --> 00:16.101
But you are the rare woman
I've come across

00:16.150 --> 00:19.517
for whom I believe
that extra effort is worthwhile.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.017
(urgent chatter)

00:26.720 --> 00:29.188
Table 12! Four top-- one
custard, one consomm,

00:29.230 --> 00:31.050
two filets, one mid,
one mid well!

00:31.090 --> 00:32.728
Step on it!
MAN:
Heard!

00:32.760 --> 00:35.797
I got branzino dying
on the counter here, Erin!

00:35.830 --> 00:38.094
Where the hell
are my mushrooms?
Yes, Chef.

00:39.770 --> 00:40.737
Hey!

00:40.770 --> 00:43.603
Hey, do me a favor.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.733
Go back to your station,
pull your head out of your ass,

00:45.770 --> 00:49.843
and make me a side of mushrooms
that isn't undercooked.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.212
I swear, one of these days,
I'm gonna murder that guy.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.615
Well, get in line.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.708
Chef Joe, you all right?

00:58.750 --> 01:01.253
I will be when I get
my frickin' mushrooms.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.567
Chef Joe?

01:14.470 --> 01:16.165
I don't understand.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.701
You're asking about the motive
behind an armed robbery?

01:18.740 --> 01:22.301
In the State's version _
of events, Detective, my client

01:22.350 --> 01:24.306
shot the clerk after
he was given the cash

01:24.350 --> 01:25.806
from the register.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.114
I'm merely asking, why
would anyone do that?

01:28.150 --> 01:29.686
You'd have to ask your client.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.813
My job is
to find the guilty party.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.715
I did my job.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.854
Yes. Now let's talk about
how you did your job,

01:36.890 --> 01:38.721
shall we?
I'd like to turn

01:38.760 --> 01:41.251
your attention to a witness
you referenced

01:41.300 --> 01:43.894
in your testimony: Samuel Cruz.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.637
You said Mr. Cruz was
outside the store,

01:46.670 --> 01:48.638
and he saw my client
flee the scene?

01:48.670 --> 01:50.308
That's right.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.228
A'I'I'ORNEY: Mr. Cruz's statement
was taken on the day

01:52.280 --> 01:54.373
of the robbery-- March 28, 2016?

01:54.410 --> 01:56.503
Yes.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.519
I just want to be crystal clear
here for the jury.

01:59.550 --> 02:02.644
It's your sworn testimony,
Mr. Cruz

02:02.690 --> 02:04.282
told investigators he saw

02:04.320 --> 02:05.810
my client, Mr. Walker,

02:05.850 --> 02:07.454
flee the scene of the crime?

02:09.330 --> 02:10.524
Yes, sir.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.723
No further questions,
Your Honor.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.938
Marcus. Hey.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.858
You looked a little seasick
towards the end there.

02:23.910 --> 02:24.934
Is everything okay?

02:24.970 --> 02:26.870
Not really.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.468
What do you mean?

02:28.510 --> 02:30.705
I think...

02:30.750 --> 02:33.139
I think I might have
perjured myself.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.484
FIONA:
Okay. I can see you now.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.714
Apologies. I've, uh, taken

02:41.760 --> 02:42.920
to covering
all the lenses in here.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.450
Why?

02:44.490 --> 02:45.752
Well, let's just say

02:45.790 --> 02:47.621
the NSA doesn't like me
as much as you do.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.924
You think a government agency
is spying on you?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.767
Probably not this week.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.529
So, uh, it's been a month.

02:53.570 --> 02:56.232
Are you ready to pass judgment
on Philadelphia?

02:56.270 --> 02:58.864
The people here...

02:58.910 --> 03:00.639
enjoy eating cheesesteak

03:00.680 --> 03:02.477
and talking about
cheesesteak very much.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.876
I don't enjoy either activity
as much as they do.

03:04.910 --> 03:07.879
But I like the river.
It's quiet.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.842
So you've been spending time
on the Delaware?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.450
For work. I thought I told you.

03:12.490 --> 03:14.549
Uh, in your e-mail,
you mentioned a business trip

03:14.590 --> 03:17.479
in Philadelphia, but, uh,
nothing about the river.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.794
Oh.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.525
We're installing an experimental

03:21.560 --> 03:23.266
auto-navigation program
on a barge.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.996
It maps the riverbed
and sets its course accordingly.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.793
Sounds interesting.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.535
It isn't.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.538
Or at least it isn't for me.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.777
It's work. Can we talk
about something else?

03:33.810 --> 03:34.936
Yes.

03:34.980 --> 03:37.005
Good, because I had an idea.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.814
I'd like to spend some time
with you in person.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.545
It's been weeks.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.343
You want me to_come
to Philadelphia?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.914
I don't.

03:44.950 --> 03:49.284
I want you to come to
Cranbury Township, New Jersey.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.719
It's exactly halfway between
Philadelphia and New York.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.628
There's a bed-and-breakfast
called The Nestle Inn.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.890
(phone chimes)
Right. Oh.

03:57.930 --> 04:00.296
Is something wrong?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.501
I'm being summoned
to the scene of a crime.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.007
That's okay.
We can talk later.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.735
We can talk
in Cranbury Township.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.704
So you'll come?

04:07.740 --> 04:08.729
Yes.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.998
That's good.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.745
I wasn't sure you'd say yes.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.010
Well, you should have been.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.347
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

04:16.390 --> 04:17.709
Victim's name is Joe Leshner.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.354
He was the head chef here.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.654
He passed out
at the end of lunch,

04:21.690 --> 04:23.749
collapsed on the floor
over here; witnesses say

04:23.790 --> 04:26.850
he was bleeding from the
eyes before he went down.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.925
Coagulopathy that extreme
could be the result

04:28.960 --> 04:30.666
of a toxin in the body.

04:30.700 --> 04:31.962
Maybe he was poisoned.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.536
Oh, yeah, we're
gonna have to wait

04:33.570 --> 04:35.629
for the autopsy
for sure, but, yeah.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.558
And he might not
been the only one.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.534
Line cook Mateo Lima started
showmg some low-grade symptoms,

04:40.580 --> 04:42.798
and he's getting
tended to out front.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.808
Well, Arrondissement 21 is
one of the hottest restaurants

04:45.850 --> 04:47.943
in the city; maybe one
of its competitors tried

04:47.980 --> 04:49.584
to wipe out the staff?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.087
GREGSON: Well, at the
moment, I'm inclined

04:51.120 --> 04:53.452
to think that, uh, the target

04:53.490 --> 04:55.958
was Leshner, and Lima
was just collateral.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.548
The cooks here say

04:57.590 --> 05:00.320
Chef Joe wasn't winning
any popularity contests.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.488
Maybe that's why someone closed
his cotton candy foie gras.

05:03.530 --> 05:05.896
Lumps of duck liver
wrapped in spun sugar.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.934
Obscenely pretentious
and, in this case, quite deadly.

05:09.970 --> 05:13.679
Someone's injected the
meaty center with snake venom.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.871
_ Tell me
you didn't just eat some.

05:15.910 --> 05:17.605
HOLMES: Oh, it's quite harmless
if ingested orally.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.414
Stomach acid neutralizes
the toxin.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.543
It's only dangerous
if it enters the blood.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.615
Hence, the fiberglass.

05:24.650 --> 05:25.947
The what?
Fiberglass.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.050
These granules--
some of them are sea salt.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.594
Others are tiny shards
of fiberglass

05:32.630 --> 05:35.394
meant to create microscopic
abrasions in the mouth.

05:35.430 --> 05:38.069
So the snake venom could be
absorbed into the bloodstream.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.660
Pretty sure you'd know
if you were eating fiberglass.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.361
HOLMES: Well, this has been
ground down exceedingly fine,

05:42.410 --> 05:45.664
so adding it to a dish like this
would yield little more

05:45.710 --> 05:47.575
than a chalky texture.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.702
That's a new one.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.503
Yeah.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.769
That sick line cook's gonna know
who made this.

05:55.050 --> 05:58.110
I ate snake venom?

05:58.150 --> 06:00.755
Am I... am I gonna be okay?

06:00.790 --> 06:02.428
Well, it appears so.

06:02.460 --> 06:03.882
How much did you eat?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.818
Uh, just a bite.
Hmm.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.420
I mean, Chef Joe didn't
usually share it with us.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.167
Didn't want anyone figuring out
his special recipe.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.169
Right. You mean he
made that food himself?

06:14.200 --> 06:15.929
Last night.

06:15.970 --> 06:18.063
He'd usually make a batch
after we'd close.

06:18.110 --> 06:20.101
Store it in the prep fridge.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.074
Hard to imagine
he was our poisoner.

06:22.110 --> 06:24.169
So only restaurant employees
have access

06:24.210 --> 06:25.848
to the kitchen, is that correct?

06:25.880 --> 06:28.576
Normally, yeah.
But?

06:28.620 --> 06:30.542
We had a break-in last night.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.182
Now, somebody broke the lock
on the back door,

06:32.220 --> 06:33.858
tried the safe in the office.

06:33.890 --> 06:36.620
It looks like they gave up
when it wouldn't open.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.150
Maybe it was cover
for the poisoner.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.591
That batch in the kitchen

06:41.630 --> 06:45.418
was for a private lunch
we had here today.

06:45.470 --> 06:46.698
You served it?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.129
It was a seven top,

06:49.170 --> 06:51.035
our first seating
of the day.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.606
They called ahead,
they said

06:52.640 --> 06:54.505
they all wanted
the chef's tasting menu.

06:54.540 --> 06:58.749
It-It's the only way you can get
our famous foie gras.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.577
So seven people
ate fiberglass

07:00.620 --> 07:02.542
and snake venom here
earlier today.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.080
And anyone who looked
in the reservation book

07:04.120 --> 07:06.042
would have known that
they were gomg to eat that?

07:06.090 --> 07:07.978
You think one of them
was the target.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.658
One of them or all of them.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.920
We might not be looking
at the death of one man.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.657
We might be investigating
a mass murder.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.691
*

07:21.800 --> 07:23.665
Heck of a welcome-home gift.
Our first week back,

07:23.710 --> 07:25.905
and I'm look at
neuropathy, coagulopathy,

07:25.940 --> 07:28.579
myelosis, internal
hemorrhaging, renal failure.

07:28.610 --> 07:30.669
Textbook envenomation symptoms.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.769
If it weren't for the chef
uniform, I'd have pegged

07:32.820 --> 07:35.209
Mr. Leshner for a snake charmer,
a bad one.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.047
No idea what type of snake
the venom came from?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.648
That's gonna take some time.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.783
There's no one test_to
ID. the source speCIes.

07:40.820 --> 07:43.527
I have to run Mr. Leshner's
blood against a bunch

07:43.560 --> 07:45.187
of known samples
to find a match.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.222
But I can tell you, the stuff
is neurotoxic and very potent.

07:49.630 --> 07:50.927
You said the restaurant
couldn't identify

07:50.970 --> 07:52.733
the seven other people
who ate it?

07:52.770 --> 07:54.237
All we got is the name
of the guy

07:54.270 --> 07:56.261
who made the reservation:
Daniel 0. Lukic.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.734
And we ran him
through the RTCC.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.000
No hi_ts.
There's not a Single person

08:01.040 --> 08:03.179
in the country
that's got that name.

08:03.210 --> 08:06.077
So we're thinking
it's probably an alias.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.772
Well, if he and his lunch mates
ate more than a nibble of that

08:08.820 --> 08:11.015
foie gras, we're gonna be seeing
them down here soon enough.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.984
(phone ringing, phone chimes)
I got to get that.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.088
GREGSON: Another victim
just turned up.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.598
Tate Orvis,
Brooklyn software programmer.

08:19.630 --> 08:23.020
Showed up at Stuyvesant Memorial
half hour ago.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.560
He didn't make it.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.932
Symptoms same
as the chef.

08:26.970 --> 08:29.131
Well, we have to ﬁnd out
who all these people were

08:29.170 --> 08:31.309
before we can figure out
who wanted them dead and why.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.978
At least we have a lead.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.830
We have two. There's a name
on the reservation.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.576
I just said
there's nobody in the country

08:37.610 --> 08:39.248
named Daniel O. Lukic.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.316
There is however a Danilo Lukic.

08:41.350 --> 08:44.114
D-A-N-I-L-O.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.947
Whoever took the reservation
mistook his first name

08:45.990 --> 08:47.252
for his first name

08:47.290 --> 08:48.609
and a middle initial.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.321
Mr. Lukic is a Serbian national.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.897
He designs onboard computers
for a car company in Belgrade.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.227
And according to them,

08:54.260 --> 08:56.194
he's on vacation
in New York this week,

08:56.230 --> 08:58.869
staying at the Vera
Hotel in Queens.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.337
Marcus, nice of
you to join.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.235
They just let you in here, huh?

09:08.280 --> 09:11.169
Well, once I explained there
might be a dead Serbian inside,

09:11.210 --> 09:13.110
they were very accommodating.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.675
Oh, there wasn't,
as you can see.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.211
But, uh, they invited me to
stay and have a look around

09:18.250 --> 09:20.957
if it might help them
locate their poisoned guest.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.685
Any luck so far?

09:22.730 --> 09:25.255
I've learned that Danilo
Lukic is a Sagittarius,

09:25.290 --> 09:26.894
he's allergic to corn,

09:26.930 --> 09:29.763
and he collects
penguin-themed bric-a-brac.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.588
His whereabouts however
remain a mystery.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.609
Look, there's something
we need to talk about.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.107
I was in court
this morning.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.971
You remember Leon Walker?

09:40.010 --> 09:43.104
Killed that bodega owner, fled
with cash from the register.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.710
Yeah, $207, if
memory serves.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.968
There was a witness:
Samuel Cruz.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.988
You said he saw the shooter
flee the store?

09:50.020 --> 09:52.716
Yeah, he did.
He told you
he saw Leon Walker?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.012
He didn't have to.
It was obvious.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.721
What do you mean,
it was obvious?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.387
Cruz was, uh, peddling

09:58.430 --> 10:00.990
bootleg perfume
outside the store that day.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.760
Couldn't afford to leave
his elicit business unattended,

10:03.800 --> 10:06.633
so... there's no question
he was there.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.194
I mean, Walker ran out
after the shooting.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.764
Okay, but he could have
been looking

10:09.810 --> 10:11.664
in the other direction,
he could have...

10:11.710 --> 10:13.905
Walker knocked over a rack
of Cruz's fragrances.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.669
They shattered
all over the sidewalk.

10:15.710 --> 10:16.904
There was still
glass on the ground

10:16.950 --> 10:18.076
when I arrived
at the scene.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.873
And given the fact that the, uh,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.410
murder weapon reeked
of Eu de Toilette

10:21.450 --> 10:23.918
when it was recovered
a day later, stood to reason.

10:23.950 --> 10:25.679
It can't stand to reason.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.688
Mr. Cruz being a witness--
that's part of the State's case.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.654
I'm confused as to why
they would introduce him.

10:29.690 --> 10:30.759
Leon Walker's DNA
and fingerprints

10:30.790 --> 10:32.087
were found at the scene,

10:32.130 --> 10:33.757
there was a ballistics match
on his weapon,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.654
and the money was recovered
in his apartment.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.759
So what Cruz saw or didn't see
doesn't bloody matter.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.668
It does now. I just told a jury
that Cruz said he saw Walker.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.338
I thought it was rock-solid,

10:43.370 --> 10:45.861
and your notes
were shorthanded...

10:45.910 --> 10:47.229
My notes were misinterpreted.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.838
Either way, we got a problem.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.245
The way the defense attorney

10:50.280 --> 10:52.407
was harping on it,
my guess is he's gonna

10:52.450 --> 10:54.748
put Cruz on the stand
and Cruz is gonna have

10:54.780 --> 10:56.372
a different story to tell.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.240
They'll use the discrepancy
to make it look like

10:58.290 --> 10:59.848
we bungled the investigation.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.255
Did you tell the ADA?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.724
Yeah, she's not happy.
She wants to put us both

11:03.760 --> 11:05.921
in front of a judge
to walk all this back

11:05.960 --> 11:07.029
when court resumes
next week.

11:07.060 --> 11:08.220
That's not going to happen.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.091
There is no
question that Cruz

11:10.130 --> 11:11.324
saw Walker flee the scene.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.065
If the court _
wants us to prove it,

11:13.100 --> 11:14.362
then we'll just prove it.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.732
But not at the moment.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.806
Something wrong?

11:18.840 --> 11:20.307
All the beverages

11:20.340 --> 11:22.308
in this room are made
by the same conglomerate,

11:22.340 --> 11:23.876
apart from this wine.

11:23.910 --> 11:26.378
So Mr. Lukic _
brought his own Wine.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.719
Not wine.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.739
Just the bottle.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.910
Any idea what those are?

11:37.830 --> 11:40.719
I can't believe Tate's dead.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.069
I was just in a meeting with him
this morning.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.762
He was poisoned at lunch,
Mrs. Shea.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.189
And it looks like
several other people were dosed.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.208
So far, we've been
unable to identify them.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.936
Any chance you know
who he was dining with?

11:52.980 --> 11:54.470
Sorry, no.

11:54.510 --> 11:56.478
I'm not plugged into
Tate's calendar.

11:56.510 --> 11:59.479
He was the CEO.
I'm just the HR lady.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.216
Well, you're
more than that.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.309
What do you mean?
We went through

12:03.350 --> 12:05.079
your social media accounts.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.112
Three Saturdays ago, you
posted a photo of a sunset.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.857
The caption read: "Beautiful
night with friends."

12:11.890 --> 12:13.255
So?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.858
So, the photo was taken

12:14.900 --> 12:17.391
from the porch
of Tate's summer home

12:17.430 --> 12:18.522
in Vermont.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.865
You weren't with friends,
you were with Tate.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.401
You were having an affair.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.135
We spoke to Mr. Orvis's
housekeeper.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.467
She said last week

12:26.510 --> 12:27.932
you two had a fight.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.073
He called you a psycho.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.907
Why would he say
something like that?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.408
You're right.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.884
We were sleeping together.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.387
He called me crazy

12:39.420 --> 12:41.149
because he didn't
want to tell the truth.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.283
Which was?

12:43.330 --> 12:44.888
He was two-timing me.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.421
I was at his place when
I overheard him talking

12:47.460 --> 12:49.428
to an Italian woman
on the phone.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.325
I didn't recognize her voice.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.598
You listened in on the call.

12:52.630 --> 12:57.465
I heard him say "I miss you,"
so I picked up the other line.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.308
They were saying how excited
they were to see each other.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.877
After they hung up, I
stared poking around.

13:02.910 --> 13:07.415
I found these weird key cards...

13:07.450 --> 13:09.441
in his wallet.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.479
I thought they were to get into
places where he was meeting her.

13:16.520 --> 13:20.251
When I couldn't connect
them to any hotels,

13:20.300 --> 13:21.949
I confronted him.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.422
He got angry.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.028
He wouldn't tell me anything

13:25.070 --> 13:27.038
about the cards
or the woman.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.560
Our thing...

13:28.600 --> 13:31.000
was over.

13:32.340 --> 13:35.002
But I didn't kill him.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.598
You have to believe me.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.279
We might, if you can tell us
where you were last night.

13:39.310 --> 13:41.414
Home.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.088
With my husband.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.151
I know you could
tell him about the affair.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.556
Could ruin my life.

13:49.590 --> 13:52.286
But I swear, he's just
gonna tell you the same thing.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.855
Sorry. He's gonna have to.

13:58.230 --> 14:01.836
(door opens, closes)

14:05.070 --> 14:06.537
Do I smell Thai food?

14:06.570 --> 14:08.208
Yes, there's
tom yum goong in here.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.605
Oh.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.212
Finally, some good news.
I am starving.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.344
So, it turns out that Tate Orvis
is a real lothario,

14:16.380 --> 14:17.938
but a pretty unlikely
murder target.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.413
The captain and I
spent the last few hours

14:20.460 --> 14:22.553
calling every hospital
in the city,

14:22.590 --> 14:24.558
trying to find a new lead.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.251
Didn't find a single one.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.655
Day was a total bust.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.190
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

14:29.230 --> 14:30.925
The photographs you sent
of the key cards

14:30.970 --> 14:34.292
that Sydney Shea found
proved quite useful.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.207
These were hidden
in Danilo Lukic's hotel room.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.273
They're identical.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.175
Sydney thought
that these were proof

14:46.210 --> 14:48.678
that Tate was having an affair
with some Italian mistress.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.984
She's not his mistress.
She's a telecom executive.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.056
Her name is Serafina DiTomasso.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.910
I was struggling
to grasp the connection

14:54.960 --> 14:56.655
between a software guru
from Brooklyn

14:56.690 --> 14:58.521
and an auto worker
from Belgrade.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.551
These key cards tell the tale.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.591
Do you know what they're for?
No idea.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.689
But I know where they came from.
Each one is marked

15:04.730 --> 15:07.938
with an alphanumeric code
which begins with "IAO."

15:07.970 --> 15:09.597
IIIAOII?

15:09.640 --> 15:10.937
The Internet Address
Organization.

15:10.970 --> 15:12.608
It is a nonprofit organization

15:12.640 --> 15:15.200
comprised of eminent
computer science professionals.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.071
The group is very secretive.

15:17.110 --> 15:20.079
But online rumors suggest
that these seven individuals

15:20.120 --> 15:21.576
are its leaders.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.214
So you think Serafina DiTomasso
and the others

15:24.250 --> 15:26.081
_ _ are the five _
missmg p0ison Victims.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.212
I've managed to confirm

15:27.260 --> 15:28.989
that each one of these people

15:29.020 --> 15:31.079
has business
in New York this week.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.554
The NYPD is sending patrol cars
to their hotels as we speak.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.659
Hmm.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.497
You seem a little disappointed.

15:38.530 --> 15:42.091
No, I just thought, with the...
secret key cards

15:42.140 --> 15:43.539
and the snake venom and
the foreign affairs,

15:43.570 --> 15:46.971
we'd be dealing with
spies or assassins.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.399
Not... you know, tech support.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.045
I mean, why would anyone
want to wipe out this group?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.445
They seem so mundane.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.311
I mean, what would
killing them even achieve?

15:55.350 --> 15:58.285
Airport shutdowns, power grid
failures, financial meltdowns,

15:58.320 --> 16:00.413
nuclear war--
take your pick.
What are you talking about?

16:00.460 --> 16:04.226
The IAO controls core security
for the entire Internet.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.488
These people are
many things, Watson,

16:05.530 --> 16:07.998
but mundane...

16:08.030 --> 16:10.021
they are not.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.160
BELL: I'm sorry if you don't
like my questions, Mr. Dalal,

16:18.210 --> 16:19.336
but you still
have to answer them.

16:19.370 --> 16:22.077
Yesterday, my friend Tate
was killed.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.600
This morning, I wake up to hear

16:23.650 --> 16:25.504
Danilo died
on a subway platform.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.518
Now you tell me
everyone else in the group was

16:27.550 --> 16:30.246
found dead in their hotel rooms
and you think I'm to blame.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.178
We don't know what to think
right now, but we're trying

16:32.220 --> 16:34.108
to solve these murders
and you're not helping.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.219
What conclusions are we supposed
to draw from that?

16:36.260 --> 16:38.080
That these people were
dear friends of mine?

16:38.130 --> 16:40.291
That it's taking me some time
to process this nightmare?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.627
We completely
understand,

16:41.660 --> 16:44.367
but we have urgent questions
we need to ask.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.721
So you admit you
and your friends were leaders

16:46.770 --> 16:48.089
of the IAO.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.596
You were at
the same lunch,

16:49.640 --> 16:51.437
but you were the only one
who survived it.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.609
I didn't eat
the poisoned foie gras

16:53.640 --> 16:55.528
because I'm a vegetarian.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.172
My entire life. Ask anyone.

16:57.210 --> 16:58.700
HOLMES: The restaurant
manager said that

16:58.750 --> 17:00.445
13 menu items were served.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.072
Two of them contained meat.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.644
Two out of the 13.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.749
BELL: Pretty luclq the
snake venom just happened

17:05.790 --> 17:08.350
to be in one of the two
dishes you couldn't eat

17:08.390 --> 17:10.426
instead of one of
the 11 you could.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.224
That is exactly
what it was-- luclq!

17:13.260 --> 17:15.148
You said the food was poisoned

17:15.200 --> 17:17.191
during a break-in
the night before, right?

17:18.330 --> 17:20.764
I was at my hotel,
the Belmont in Queens.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.166
Look at their security footage;
I was there all night.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.166
You also ought to be
asking yourselves

17:25.210 --> 17:27.428
why on earth would anyone
have wanted us dead.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.436
We don't know how
your group works.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.698
You guys don't exactly
advertise your methods.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.412
Based on what we do know,
it looks like the first step

17:34.450 --> 17:35.610
to taking over the Internet.

17:35.650 --> 17:39.609
If that's what you think,
then you understand very little.

17:39.650 --> 17:40.810
HOLMES:
By all means,

17:40.860 --> 17:42.612
enlighten us.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.584
The Internet is_ built
on the premise

17:45.630 --> 17:48.292
that when people type in
the address of a Web site,

17:48.330 --> 17:51.094
they are sent to the legitimate
version of that site.

17:51.130 --> 17:53.189
When the seven of us
would meet up,

17:53.240 --> 17:55.231
we would verify
that every entry

17:55.270 --> 17:57.636
in the online phone book
was legitimate.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.776
If we didn't, a bunch
of fake sites would pop up

18:00.810 --> 18:02.801
to steal users' personal data,

18:02.840 --> 18:06.105
plant, uh, spyware on-on phones
and computers...

18:06.150 --> 18:09.711
So, seven people verify every
Web site on the Internet?

18:09.750 --> 18:11.638
We use an algorithm to do it.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.716
What happens if someone gets
their hands on that algorithm?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.580
Well, they couldn't.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.520
Not without these.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.892
WATSON: Danilo Lukic
and Tate Orvis had those cards.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.750
What are they?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.768
When the algorithm isn't in use,

18:24.800 --> 18:27.689
it's divided into seven parts
and stored on hard drives.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.232
The drives are kept in safes,
locked with these.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.376
But even if someone snatched
all of our cards--

18:34.410 --> 18:36.878
and whoever poisoned our lunch
obviously didn't--

18:36.910 --> 18:38.901
they'd still need to clear
a dozen hurdles

18:38.950 --> 18:40.770
before they could do
any real harm.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.219
What do you mean?

18:42.250 --> 18:44.445
We're just the first line
of defense.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.789
There are backup algorithms
and fail-safe alarms,

18:47.820 --> 18:49.856
replacement key-holders.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.256
There isn't_ a scheme
I could imagine

18:52.290 --> 18:55.623
that would actually benefit
from my friends dying.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.809
Thought talking to that guy
would clear things up.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.603
It didn't.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.835
So... if the deaths
of his friends

19:08.880 --> 19:10.677
didn't further
any Internet coup d'tat,

19:10.710 --> 19:12.701
we might want to consider
a more personal motive.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.638
One member of the group
had an enemy;

19:14.680 --> 19:16.614
the other deaths
were collateral damage.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.413
Well, before
we look into

19:18.450 --> 19:20.315
these people's lives,
we should check out his story,

19:20.360 --> 19:21.759
see if there's video
at the hotel

19:21.790 --> 19:23.280
at the time of the break-in.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.729
Any chance you could
do that without us?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.887
We have a quick
errand to run.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.750
Old case that's on trial.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.597
Yeah. I'll be in touch.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.298
So you were supposed to meet
with Samuel Cruz this morning.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.467
Were you not able to
confirm my suspicions?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.239
Actually, I was able.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.430
I laid out your
broken perfume bottle story

19:42.480 --> 19:44.675
and said we know
he saw Leon Walker's face

19:44.710 --> 19:46.701
as Walker fled
the scene of the shooting.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.377
He admitted it,
told me everything.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.388
He says he was being pressured
by the defendant

19:50.420 --> 19:52.388
to lie on the stand;
he was gonna say

19:52.420 --> 19:54.615
the person he saw running
from the store was a woman.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.957
I'm sure the defense attorney
would have

19:55.990 --> 19:57.526
had a field day
with that discrepancy.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.585
You and I get to tell the ADA.
the good news.

19:59.630 --> 20:02.394
There are seven murders by snake
venom waiting to be solved.

20:02.430 --> 20:04.466
Six IAO key-holders, one chef.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.798
Could you not regurgitate
that happy report on your own?

20:06.830 --> 20:09.958
The ADA. wants to be sure our
Wires aren't crossed anymore.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.934
This is about putting
a murderer away.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.801
It'll take 30 minutes.

20:16.910 --> 20:20.346
You got Mr. Cruz's signature
under an affidavit?

20:20.380 --> 20:22.473
Figure that way,
he can't get squirrelly again.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.317
He swore out the real story,

20:24.350 --> 20:26.648
picked our guy out
of a photo array.

20:26.690 --> 20:28.749
That's a relief.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.678
I'm gonna take this to
Judge Williams right now.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.982
You know, we can go with you
if you think it'll help.

20:33.030 --> 20:35.453
No. The old man
loves me.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.649
Let me lay it out for
him; he'll forgive

20:36.700 --> 20:38.827
your mistake on the stand,
probably call defense counsel

20:38.870 --> 20:40.599
to chambers and read
them the riot act.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.937
(chuckles softly)

20:41.970 --> 20:43.267
It'll be fine, I promise.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.005
Thanks. I, uh...

20:45.040 --> 20:46.769
I'll breathe easier
when it's over.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.835
You think I'd let my
favorite cop get tripped up

20:48.880 --> 20:50.438
over some nonsense like this?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.370
As for you, Mr. Holmes,

20:53.420 --> 20:55.843
try to be a little more careful
writing your reports.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.438
You kind of put your
friend in a spot.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.548
Actually, it was my...

20:58.590 --> 21:01.388
No, no, she's right--
the error was entirely mine.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.058
My apologies to both of you.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.422
All right.
Oh, I'm due in court.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.586
Thank you, gentlemen.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.865
I am now retracting
my apologies.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.607
You know, if you'd have told me
you had a crush on Ms. Milner

21:17.640 --> 21:19.505
before we came here,
I could've told you to wear

21:19.540 --> 21:21.371
a different color shirt;
there's ample literature

21:21.410 --> 21:23.037
on which colors
women are most attracted to,

21:23.080 --> 21:24.775
and purple isn't one of them.

21:24.810 --> 21:27.370
That was a business meeting,
not a speed date.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.480
It was both. You dragged me here
to save face with that A.D.A.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.388
I would've been happy to
be your wingman/scapegoat.

21:34.420 --> 21:36.888
I wasn't trying to put the blame
on you, I just wanted

21:36.920 --> 21:38.888
to make sure everything
was squared up for her.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.398
Yeah, 'cause you're
attracted to her.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.921
All right, fine.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.619
I like her.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.069
Despite her wedding ring?

21:47.100 --> 21:48.931
It's to keep guys away.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.801
She's in the middle
of a divorce.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.104
Look, when that's all done
and I ask her out,

21:53.140 --> 21:55.074
it's important she knows
I'm good at my job.

21:55.110 --> 21:57.544
Why? You want to romance her,
not go into business with her.

21:57.580 --> 21:58.899
Maybe you haven't noticed,

21:58.950 --> 22:01.578
but my work is kind of
a big part of who I am.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.680
It's important to you, and you
want to be important to her.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.517
The transitive property
doesn't apply.

22:06.550 --> 22:07.756
You think I'd be into Chantal

22:07.790 --> 22:09.519
if she wasn't great
at what she does?

22:09.560 --> 22:11.858
It's what attracted me to her
in the first place.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.699
Tell me it's not
the same for you

22:13.730 --> 22:15.698
and that woman _ _
you've been seeing. FeIICIa?

22:15.730 --> 22:16.651
Fiona.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.668
People in relationships,

22:18.700 --> 22:20.122
they talk about their jobs--

22:20.170 --> 22:22.832
how things are going,
the ups and downs.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.565
Pretty sure I'm not crazy here.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.807
(phone ringing)

22:27.840 --> 22:30.809
Watson. Did Mr. Dalal's
story check out?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.806
It did.
But that's not why I'm calling.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.512
I found the motive for the
attack on the key-holder group.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.040
Or rather, it found me.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.913
Somebody sent a video to
every news station in New York.

22:39.950 --> 22:42.089
Listen to this.

22:43.690 --> 22:45.089
MALE VOICE (distorted):
God declared

22:45.130 --> 22:47.018
that the meek
shall inherit the Earth.

22:47.060 --> 22:50.154
That was 2,000 years ago.
We've waited long enough.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.089
The IAO key-holders
just got a taste of our justice

22:53.130 --> 22:54.563
in their foie gras.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.067
Wall Street is next.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.660
Corporate America
hasn't shared the wealth.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.836
Today, they lose it all.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.599
We're already inside the market.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.834
We can't be stopped.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.543
There's only one thing
left to do: panic.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.142
They must've heard
about the threat.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.817
This place is a zoo.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.408
WOMAN:
Mr. Holmes?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.654
Ms. Watson.

23:15.690 --> 23:17.089
Captain Gregson told me
you were coming.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.088
Lillian Dunbar,
head of operations.

23:19.130 --> 23:21.052
I understand you're consultants.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.829
Is no one else joining us?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.498
Most of the Major Case
Squad is working on

23:24.530 --> 23:25.622
a lead our tech
people found.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.763
They think they know where
the threat was sent from.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.688
We've been sent to learn more
about what its author

23:29.740 --> 23:31.833
would need to do to make good
on his warnings.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.974
The US. Stock Exchange receives

23:34.010 --> 23:37.173
a dozen threats a week--
they're usually bogus.

23:37.210 --> 23:40.441
Six dead IAO key-holders lend
a certain weight to this one.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.778
Of course. That's why
we're taking it seriously.

23:42.820 --> 23:45.789
When we get a threat that looks
like it might be legitimate,

23:45.820 --> 23:47.981
the exchange enacts
a set of protocols

23:48.020 --> 23:49.851
to ensure the security
of our system.

23:49.890 --> 23:51.528
Passwords are reset,

23:51.560 --> 23:54.097
mandatory client ID.
numbers are replaced,

23:54.130 --> 23:57.099
and we conduct a system-wide
audit of our online networks,

23:57.130 --> 23:58.688
from the high frequency
trading servers

23:58.730 --> 24:00.163
all the way down
to the power grid.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.168
And, of course, we
freeze all trading.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.202
That's why all these people
are going home?

24:04.240 --> 24:05.901
Everyone but the techies.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.238
Most of the protocols are
completed by in-house staff,

24:08.280 --> 24:10.032
but the system audit

24:10.080 --> 24:14.119
is done by a team of outside
cybersecurity consultants.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.845
So you don't think this guy
can make good

24:15.880 --> 24:17.518
on his promise
to burn it all down.

24:17.550 --> 24:19.916
Ask anyone who works
in the stock market

24:19.950 --> 24:21.850
how to eliminate all risk.

24:21.890 --> 24:24.256
They'll tell you
it can't be done.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.884
But I'm telling you
we've done it.
(elevator bell dings)

24:35.300 --> 24:37.609
It's weird seeing it
quiet like this.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.868
I'm used to the pandemonium

24:38.910 --> 24:40.707
when they show
the trading floor on TV.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.708
It's pretty rare for
us to suspend trading.

24:42.740 --> 24:45.004
But when it happens,
people clear out quick.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.746
Well, everyone likes a snow day,
even when it doesn't snow.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.010
I think your traders have
been sent home over a hoax.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.644
I share your optimism,
but I have to ask,

24:52.690 --> 24:54.180
what's yours based on?

24:54.220 --> 24:56.188
When we spoke to the last
remaining IAO key-holder,

24:56.220 --> 24:58.780
he was utterly convinced
that global Internet security

24:58.830 --> 24:59.580
was not in jeopardy.

24:59.630 --> 25:01.052
If anything, the
security measures

25:02.630 --> 25:04.666
It's likely this is
a bizarre ruse,

25:04.700 --> 25:07.589
designed to provoke precisely
the actions that you've taken.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.609
I guess it's possible,
but we don't really have

25:10.640 --> 25:12.130
a choice about how to respond.

25:12.170 --> 25:15.674
It doesn't matter whether
the attack is real or fake.

25:15.710 --> 25:17.974
What matters is the public
believes it's real.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.717
We have to run our protocols
so we can restore

25:20.750 --> 25:23.218
public confidence
and trading can resume.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.547
When it does,
I wouldn't be surprised

25:24.590 --> 25:25.682
if the killer was set to profit.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.789
WATSON:
Probably only a handful

25:26.820 --> 25:28.117
of ways to do that.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.116
He would_have to make
certain investments,

25:30.160 --> 25:32.048
buy or short stocks
known for sharp gains

25:32.090 --> 25:33.990
or losses in a panic.
We might be able

25:34.030 --> 25:36.749
to identify the culprit if
we see your recent trading data.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.768
It can't leave
the premises.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.894
But I can have my assistant
get you anything you need.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.931
Make yourselves
at home.

25:43.970 --> 25:46.837
_What's two more_
out5ide consultants, right?

25:52.650 --> 25:54.971
I have to say, if the killer's
hiding in these spreadsheets,

25:55.020 --> 25:56.647
I-I'm just not seeing him.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.156
So, I've been thinking about
something that Marcus said

26:01.190 --> 26:03.829
when he confessed his feelings
for the ADA.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.725
in the Leon Walker case.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.625
Marcus is in love? Tell me more.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.992
She's immaterial to my quandary,
but... (clears throat)

26:10.030 --> 26:12.863
he feels it's imperative
to share one's professional life

26:12.900 --> 26:14.731
with one's romantic partner
and to have

26:14.770 --> 26:16.635
that partner reciprocate.
Do you agree?

26:16.670 --> 26:19.161
I guess. But either way,
why would that bother you?

26:19.210 --> 26:20.871
I don't discuss my work
with Fiona.

26:20.910 --> 26:23.606
She doesn't discuss hers
With me.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.641
Ever?
She's been
in Philadelphia

26:25.680 --> 26:27.841
on a business trip
for the last month.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.747
I only discovered the nature
of that business yesterday.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.883
Every relationship is different.
My mother has not read one

26:32.920 --> 26:36.014
of my stepfather's novels
since the first one,

26:36.060 --> 26:38.255
and they're coming up
on their 35th anniversary.

26:38.290 --> 26:41.623
I mean, there's not always
one right way to do things.

26:41.660 --> 26:45.960
Yet being a detective is not
what I do, it's who I am.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.969
So how can I have no instinct
to share something so essential

26:49.000 --> 26:51.764
with someone
I'm professed to care for?

26:51.810 --> 26:53.163
Well, you're talking
about one thing.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.974
I mean, it's an important thing,
but still.

26:56.010 --> 26:58.342
It's not just one thing.

26:58.380 --> 27:01.213
In my life, I'd say I'd had
exactly one relationship

27:01.250 --> 27:03.343
that I would classify
as a romance.

27:03.380 --> 27:04.813
Irene.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.950
Fiona's a remarkable woman.

27:08.990 --> 27:11.879
What we have is also...
a romance.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.296
And yet...

27:14.330 --> 27:17.822
the two do not compare.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.963
It's just disappointing.

27:23.040 --> 27:28.171
What you had with Moriarty,
that's never gonna happen again.

27:28.210 --> 27:31.270
It shouldn't.

27:31.310 --> 27:34.279
You're either in love with Fiona
or you're not.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.645
Yeah.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.388
That is not a trash can.

27:45.430 --> 27:48.194
No. It's a 19th century
Empire flower vase

27:48.230 --> 27:50.869
from the Russian
Romanovich Porcelain Factory.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.460
Well, then you should watch
what you're throwing at it.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.036
I assure you,
it would take more

27:55.070 --> 27:56.890
than a piece of paper
to damage that vase.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.465
Romanovich porcelain is famous
for its exceptional quality.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.831
That's part
of what makes it so...

28:01.880 --> 28:04.269
valuable.

28:04.310 --> 28:06.870
What?

28:06.910 --> 28:08.343
I just realized,

28:08.380 --> 28:11.816
money's not the only thing
of value in this building.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.318
What are we
not looking at here?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.432
Excuse me.

28:31.470 --> 28:34.837
Where are the LeGrands?

28:34.880 --> 28:38.441
There was a trio of
post-Impressionist artwork here.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.914
The paintings,
where have they gone?

28:40.950 --> 28:43.987
Oh, yeah. They pulled them down
to pull some cable.

28:44.020 --> 28:47.239
They got 'em leaning up
against the wall right over...

28:47.290 --> 28:50.282
Guys, could I get a
20 on the paintings

28:50.320 --> 28:53.289
that hang out here
in the lobby?

28:53.330 --> 28:56.299
We've been looking for
the killer on the wrong floor.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.821
This_ isn't some
byzantine stock plot,

28:58.870 --> 29:00.428
it's an art heist.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.859
And it's happened
right under our noses.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.534
The piece on your left
is Torqued Rift #4,

29:10.580 --> 29:13.242
in the center is The Sadness,
and on the right, of course,

29:13.280 --> 29:14.838
Nurse Debriefing a Staircase.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.110
Nurse Debriefing a Staircase?
Baptiste LeGrand

29:17.150 --> 29:21.211
was pretentious, even for
a post-Impressionist painter.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.353
His work is off-putting
and overrated, in my opinion,

29:23.390 --> 29:25.551
but there's no accounting
for taste, is there?

29:25.590 --> 29:28.252
Together, these paintings
are worth roughly $60 million.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.359
GREGSON: That building was
full of people all afternoon.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.823
How the hell does somebody steal

29:32.870 --> 29:35.361
three paintings
and nobody notices?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.197
Our killer is a flimper.
He flimped.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.537
It's a pickpocket's trick.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.401
You use the distraction
of a bustling crowd

29:40.440 --> 29:42.328
to plunder your mark.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.938
The poisoning of
the IAO key-holders,

29:43.980 --> 29:45.868
the video threat
to the financial sector,

29:45.910 --> 29:48.071
it was all just a ploy to get
the stock exchange chasing

29:48.120 --> 29:50.941
its tail while the thief pulled
$60 million worth of artwork

29:50.990 --> 29:53.208
_ off the wall _ _
Without anyone noticmg.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.252
Yeah, but I've been to the
stock exchange-- that place

29:55.290 --> 29:57.383
is packed to the gills with
security cameras and alarms.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.957
Distraction or no distraction,
you can't just walk out

29:59.990 --> 30:01.526
with three canvases
under your arm.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.357
You can if the entire system
is off-line

30:03.400 --> 30:05.129
While it's being checked
for signs of hacking.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.991
I doubt John Q. Citizen knows
the ins and outs

30:08.040 --> 30:10.861
of the exchange's
security protocols.

30:10.910 --> 30:14.607
You got to think somebody on
the inside helped them out, huh?

30:14.640 --> 30:16.130
We talked to Lillian Dunbar--

30:16.180 --> 30:18.068
she's the chief of operations
over there.

30:18.110 --> 30:21.147
She's offered us access
to HR files,

30:21.180 --> 30:23.148
phone records,
even internal e-mails,

30:23.180 --> 30:25.614
anything that might help
recover the paintings.

30:25.650 --> 30:27.311
So we comb through
all the files.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.079
Any luck, we spot a suspect.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.610
Unfortunately, there isn't
enough time for luck.

30:30.660 --> 30:31.820
The exchange has
a thousand employees.

30:31.860 --> 30:34.351
It would take days to consider
each one of them in turn,

30:34.400 --> 30:36.550
and by the time we've identified
a suspect, assuming we do

30:36.600 --> 30:38.363
at all, our paintings
will have disappeared into

30:38.400 --> 30:40.425
the murlq depths of the black
market, along with our thief.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.097
So I think _there's
a more effICIent way

30:42.140 --> 30:43.596
to find the needle
in this haystack.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.437
What's that?
Well, with
your permission,

30:45.470 --> 30:48.576
Captain, I'd like
to burn the haystack down.

30:48.610 --> 30:52.068
Three stolen masterpieces are
on their way back home tonight,

30:52.110 --> 30:53.600
after the NYPD recovered
the modern art

30:53.650 --> 30:55.345
stashed in
a Hunts Point warehouse.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.473
I don't know What your
friend is so upset about.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.249
Those paintings look
just like the real thing.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.485
Jericho is an art forger
par excellence.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.613
He usually spends weeks
preparing a single counterfeit.

31:03.660 --> 31:06.254
And I asked him to do three
in ten hours.

31:06.290 --> 31:09.123
So needless to say, he doesn't
think it's his best work.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.559
WATSON: I think
they're convincing.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.626
Local news thinks
they're convmcmg.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.297
Because local
teleVI5ion reporters are

31:15.340 --> 31:18.059
the gold standard
for investigative journalism.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.566
So now what? We just wait?

31:19.610 --> 31:21.635
The publicity surrounding
the staged recovery

31:21.680 --> 31:25.070
should temporarily kill
the market for stolen art.

31:25.110 --> 31:27.203
Our thief
will have to spend time

31:27.250 --> 31:29.241
convincing any potential buyers
that he still possesses

31:29.280 --> 31:30.645
the real LeGrands.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.147
And how's he gonna do that?

31:32.190 --> 31:33.919
The same way that anyone
convinces anyone

31:33.960 --> 31:37.157
of anything these days:
by ranting about it online.

31:37.190 --> 31:38.919
I created accounts for us

31:38.960 --> 31:41.428
on several Dark Web sites
known to host conversations

31:41.460 --> 31:44.429
about black market goods.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.496
We'll monitor them for posts
of the stolen artwork,

31:47.530 --> 31:51.000
and hopefully the thief should
reveal himself soon enough.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.702
"Give to a gracious message
a host of tongues,

31:53.740 --> 31:56.937
but let ill tidings tell
themselves when they be felt."

31:56.980 --> 31:58.971
Why are you quoting
Antony and Cleopatra?

31:59.010 --> 32:01.410
There was an oncologist I knew.
He used to recite that

32:01.450 --> 32:03.714
to himself whenever he had
to deliver a bad prognosis.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.548
It's just a reminder
to speak simply

32:06.590 --> 32:09.559
and honestly to a patient
and not sugarcoat the bad news.

32:09.590 --> 32:10.818
Are you going to tell me
I have “a tumor?
0.

32:10.860 --> 32:13.488
I was just thinking about what
you said about Fiona last night.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.090
I mean, she's smart,
compassionate, beautiful.

32:18.130 --> 32:19.392
Yet you still think
she might not be right for me.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.398
Is that what you think?
I don't know.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.658
I just know that you've never
been through a breakup before.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.607
Fake deaths don't count.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.108
And besides, Moriarty did that
to you; you did not

32:29.140 --> 32:30.607
do that to her.
Listen,

32:30.640 --> 32:33.108
breakups are never easy, but
they don't have to be that bad.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.674
So just try and remember:

32:34.720 --> 32:38.087
"Give to a gracious message
a host of tongues,

32:38.120 --> 32:41.556
but let ill tidings tell
themselves when they be felt."

32:52.300 --> 32:57.192
Lights up on three devious
travelers of the Silk Road.

32:57.240 --> 33:01.700
Silent Wolf, Hungrybox
and Doctor Bumrush.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.435
They are buyers
and purveyors

33:03.480 --> 33:06.574
of stolen goods all,
and they are commiserating

33:06.610 --> 33:08.475
about a great fraud perpetrated

33:08.520 --> 33:11.239
by their much loathed nemesis
Tha PoPo.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.078
"Tha PoPo's lying, man.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.008
The art on the news is fugazi."

33:17.190 --> 33:18.384
"I'm with you.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.352
"Cops are trying
to cover their asses.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.460
"I got a guy
who knows how to get them.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.422
Message me."

33:26.470 --> 33:28.290
"I may just do that.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.069
'_'No chance _
those paintings are genume.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.567
"Just a transparent attempt

33:31.610 --> 33:34.329
to thwart the sale
of the real LeGrands."

33:34.380 --> 33:37.099
Okay. So, if these guys are
talking about the art online,

33:37.140 --> 33:39.745
then I guess
we have three good suspects.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.645
Except they're not
three suspects.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.116
They're three screen names
owned by one man.

33:45.150 --> 33:48.119
(sighs) Why don't you just
tell me what's going on here.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.287
There was a great deal
of chatter on the Dark Web

33:50.320 --> 33:52.424
about the heist yesterday.

33:52.460 --> 33:54.655
Most notably these three posts.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.192
I compared them to internal
stock exchange employee e-mails.

33:58.230 --> 34:00.721
Distinct lexical patterns
and phrases from all three

34:00.770 --> 34:05.400
recur in correspondence written
by the same man: Brian Beale.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.761
Hmm. He looks familiar.

34:07.810 --> 34:10.278
He should do. We passed him
in the lobby yesterday.

34:10.310 --> 34:13.143
Mr. Bea_le is
a cyber security expert,

34:13.180 --> 34:14.272
and he works for the firm

34:14.320 --> 34:16.743
which ran the stock exchange's
systems audit yesterday.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.578
So he had access to the building
during the robbery,

34:19.620 --> 34:21.781
and he would understand
the chaos

34:21.820 --> 34:24.459
that would be created
by an attack on

34:24.490 --> 34:26.720
the IAO key-holders,
and he's out there

34:26.760 --> 34:29.593
trying to discredit
our art recovery story.

34:29.630 --> 34:32.190
Marcus is going to meet us
at his home in half an hour.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.595
If you Wish to
change your clothes,

34:33.630 --> 34:35.097
I would ask
that you hurry.

34:37.300 --> 34:40.269
Landlord says he hasn't seen
Mr. Beale in a couple days.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.471
You recall that the back door
of Arrondissement 21

34:42.510 --> 34:43.875
was a grotesque shade
of burgundy?

34:43.910 --> 34:46.140
Tip of this crowbar
is covered

34:46.180 --> 34:47.545
in flecks of burgundy paint.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.275
Perhaps it's the tool used
to break into the restaurant

34:49.320 --> 34:51.811
so that Mr. Beale_could
envenomate the f0ie gras.

34:51.850 --> 34:54.819
Could be enough
for a conviction right there.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.852
Well, it might be enough
to sate your future girlfriend,

34:57.890 --> 34:59.426
but professional pride

34:59.460 --> 35:02.099
requires recovered paintings,
real ones.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.663
WATSON: Wherever
those paintings are,

35:04.700 --> 35:07.567
we're gonna have to
find them ourselves.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.338
He's gone.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.608
Still warm.

35:17.640 --> 35:18.675
30 minutes, maybe.

35:18.710 --> 35:20.905
I'll call for a bus and CSU.

35:20.950 --> 35:23.214
WATSON: Coagulopathy in
the tear ducts,

35:23.250 --> 35:25.411
discoloration of the armpits,
swollen glands.

35:25.450 --> 35:27.338
Venom, no doubt.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.210
This time delivered
straight from the fangs

35:29.260 --> 35:30.909
of a deadly coastal taipan.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.552
How can you tell?

35:32.590 --> 35:34.558
There's one
right behind your foot.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.489
(snake hissing)

35:37.530 --> 35:39.293
What do I do?

35:39.330 --> 35:42.436
I'm gonna look that up.

35:42.470 --> 35:45.166
I'd start with
"don't get bitten."

35:52.510 --> 35:54.876
Hey, this just
came for you.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.548
Oh.

35:57.580 --> 35:58.945
What's Clyde doing out?

35:58.990 --> 36:02.812
He's having a walk While
we sublet his terrarium.

36:02.860 --> 36:03.884
WATSON:
I-Is that...

36:05.290 --> 36:06.757
Oxyuranuss cutellatus.
Yes, the very same

36:06.790 --> 36:09.224
coastal taipan
from Brian Beale's apartment.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.750
The venom from that snake
killed eight people,

36:10.800 --> 36:12.927
including the last person
who kept it as a pet.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.359
I thought that Animal Control
was impounding it.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.789
An animal shelter is no place
for an exotic reptile.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.536
It would be destroyed.
We're just looking after it

36:20.570 --> 36:21.935
until I can deliver
it to a friend

36:21.980 --> 36:23.379
at the zoo.
In the meantime,

36:23.410 --> 36:24.877
I'm just enjoying its company.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.468
It's quite beautiful,
don't you think?

36:26.510 --> 36:27.738
And dangerous.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.441
In my experience,
those two traits

36:29.480 --> 36:31.289
are often a package deal.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.914
Oh, you're still obsessing
about your theory, huh?

36:33.950 --> 36:37.386
It's more than a theory;
it's a likelihood.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.524
Brian Beale had a partner.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.323
We found
the blueprints

36:41.360 --> 36:43.897
to the US. Stock Exchange
on Beale's desk; we found

36:43.930 --> 36:46.319
the crowbar that he used
to break into the restaurant

36:46.370 --> 36:47.462
to poison the IAO

36:47.500 --> 36:48.694
key-holders;

36:48.740 --> 36:50.537
we found the source
of the p0ison.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.538
I'm not disputing that
Brian Beale was involved.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.538
I'm disputing
that he acted alone.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.536
I don't think that snake
belonged to him.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.445
I think it belongs
to his partner.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.573
There was a terrarium
in Beale's bedroom.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.009
He had snake food.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.644
He even had snake medication.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.908
All easy enough
to plant.

37:06.950 --> 37:08.554
Have a whiff
of that snake.

37:08.590 --> 37:11.252
You'll notice a very
distinctive musk.

37:11.290 --> 37:12.689
And I only mention it because...

37:12.730 --> 37:15.290
Mr. Beale's apartment
did not smell of musk

37:15.330 --> 37:16.820
in the slightest.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.896
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to take your word on that.

37:18.930 --> 37:21.398
Yes, the optimal temperature
for a coastal taipan

37:21.440 --> 37:23.260
is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.530
Mr. Beale's thermostat
kept his home

37:25.570 --> 37:27.037
at a crisp 67 degrees.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.300
It's much too chilly
for a tropical snake.

37:29.340 --> 37:30.773
That only proves he's

37:30.810 --> 37:32.300
an inconsiderate roommate
to reptiles.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.318
It does not prove
that he had a partner

37:34.350 --> 37:35.578
who framed and killed him.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.269
You must admit
the timing of his death

37:37.320 --> 37:39.288
is highly suspicious;
we're meant to believe

37:39.320 --> 37:41.811
that he successfully milked
a deadly snake for months,

37:41.860 --> 37:44.988
only to be bitten one day after
he fenced the stolen paintings?

37:45.030 --> 37:48.295
Okay, so Who's
the missing thief?

37:48.330 --> 37:50.025
Who's trying
to frame Brian Beale?

37:50.060 --> 37:52.324
When this argument began,
I wasn't sure.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.962
But that was
before a friend of mine

37:54.000 --> 37:55.558
at Columbia's
herpetology department

37:55.600 --> 37:57.591
lent me the skeleton
of a coastal taipan.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.699
I wasn't about to
try my experiment

37:59.740 --> 38:01.503
on the fangs of a live one.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.998
But now I know.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.041
I've seen these
exact same markings before.

38:10.850 --> 38:12.408
This is ridiculous.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.384
H-How did you even
get a warrant?

38:14.420 --> 38:15.978
We looked
through the trash

38:16.020 --> 38:18.523
you put out on the curb
last night, Mr. Lima.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.824
We found pet store receipts
that show you purchased

38:20.860 --> 38:22.555
the supplies needed to house

38:22.600 --> 38:24.818
and feed
a coastal taipan.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.724
WATSON: The venom
from that species

38:26.770 --> 38:29.568
poisoned seven people
at Arrondissement 21

38:29.600 --> 38:31.909
and killed your friend
Brian Beale.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.807
I don't even know who that is.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.933
Sure you do. You went
to Gracely High together.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.574
You signed his yearbook.
We found it at his apartment.

38:39.610 --> 38:40.599
Go Tigers.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.969
BELL: You also got
a parking ticket

38:42.020 --> 38:43.669
down the block
from the restaurant

38:43.720 --> 38:46.484
at 3:15 am. on the night
the place was broken into.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.408
HOLMES: We're certain that you
were the burglar that evening.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.984
You staged a robbery
at your own kitchen

38:50.020 --> 38:51.624
to throw suspicion
off other members

38:51.660 --> 38:53.082
of staff such as yourself.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.598
I ate some of that foie gras,
remember?

38:55.630 --> 38:57.120
I was sick
for two days.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.697
Now, why in the hell
would I dose myself

38:59.730 --> 39:01.368
with snake venom?

39:01.400 --> 39:02.731
Because you're immune.
HOLMES: As you well know,

39:02.770 --> 39:03.794
there's a process

39:03.840 --> 39:05.398
called mithridatism.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.362
It's named after
King Mithridates VI,

39:07.410 --> 39:08.672
ruler of ancient Pontus.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.439
He was so afraid
of being poisoned

39:10.480 --> 39:12.948
that he would regularly
ingest very small doses

39:12.980 --> 39:16.472
of various toxins in order
to build up an immunity.

39:18.020 --> 39:20.841
I-I think you may have seen
The Princess Bride

39:20.890 --> 39:22.551
one too many times.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.854
Except that iocane powder
is fictional.

39:24.890 --> 39:27.051
Immunizing yourself
against snake venom

39:27.090 --> 39:29.092
is a scientific reality.

39:29.130 --> 39:31.462
Last night, I had
the opportunity to examine

39:31.500 --> 39:33.718
the jaws
of a coastal taipan.

39:33.770 --> 39:35.658
I realized that
the scars on your hands,

39:35.700 --> 39:38.567
scars I initially attributed
to your work as a line cook,

39:38.610 --> 39:40.862
were in fact a perfect match

39:40.910 --> 39:42.832
for the taipan's
symmetrical bite pattern.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.541
And it makes sense
that you've been bitten.

39:44.580 --> 39:45.547
You'd been
handling that snake

39:45.580 --> 39:48.140
for months, milking it
to draw out its venom.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.977
Hard work pays off.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.749
You managed to poison
the key-holder lunch

39:51.790 --> 39:52.916
Without anybody looking

39:52.950 --> 39:53.917
in your direction.

39:53.950 --> 39:55.178
And it set up
your next play--

39:55.220 --> 39:58.053
robbing those paintings
from the stock exchange.

39:58.090 --> 39:59.785
You got too greedy

39:59.830 --> 40:02.025
when you decided not to share
with Brian, though.

40:02.060 --> 40:05.461
Up until that point,
pretty tight plan.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.936
MATEO:
All your, uh... evidence

40:08.970 --> 40:10.790
is circumstantial.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.058
I mean...

40:13.110 --> 40:15.806
I went to high school
with Brian Beale.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.206
So did 900 other people.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.549
And, yeah, I got
a parking ticket that night.

40:20.580 --> 40:23.219
That happened a half a dozen
other nights, too.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.946
I leave my car at work
and take the subway home

40:25.990 --> 40:28.550
ifI have too much
to drink after hours.

40:28.590 --> 40:30.979
You may have had enough
for a... a warrant,

40:31.020 --> 40:34.456
but if you had enough to arrest
me, you already would have.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.458
I'm right, aren't I?

40:37.500 --> 40:38.797
We're not quite ready to answer

40:38.830 --> 40:41.094
that question just yet,
Mr. Lima.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.860
Uh, what are you doing?

40:43.900 --> 40:47.063
Something's preventing the water
from soaking into the soil here.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.839
Don't worry.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.075
Tree pythons are...

40:51.110 --> 40:52.941
nocturnal, right?

40:52.980 --> 40:54.641
I think.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.159
(chuckles)

41:05.190 --> 41:06.828
I have to give you credit

41:06.860 --> 41:08.521
for devising
such a clever hiding place,

41:08.560 --> 41:10.221
Mr. Lima.

41:10.260 --> 41:13.525
He will be arresting you now.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.198
(footsteps approaching)

41:17.240 --> 41:21.006
WATSON: Oh, there you are.
I just heard from Marcus.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.837
The curator at the Whitney
took a look at the painting

41:22.880 --> 41:24.199
you found
in the python terrarium.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.741
It's the real McCoy.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.247
Or LeGrand, as it were.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.975
That's one down.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.942
Actually, the other two
should be recovered soon.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.540
Mateo Lima's case went federal.
He took a deal

41:33.590 --> 41:35.683
and gave up the name
of the guy who bought them.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.585
Wise move.
The US. government

41:37.620 --> 41:40.828
could inject him with poisons
he's not inoculated against.

41:40.860 --> 41:43.021
I'm going out for coffee.
You want to join?

41:43.060 --> 41:46.291
I can't. I have a
video chat with Fiona.

41:46.330 --> 41:50.130
You know, I bet she'd love
to hear about this case.

41:50.170 --> 41:52.638
(computer chiming)

41:52.670 --> 41:55.173
Enjoy your coffee, Watson.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.818
(sighs)

42:01.850 --> 42:04.614
(quietly): "Give to the gracious
message a host of tongues,

42:04.650 --> 42:07.585
"but let ill tidings
tell themselves...
