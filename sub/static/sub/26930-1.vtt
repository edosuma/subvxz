00:34.335 --> 00:37.269
Nana, will you tell me
a Christmas story now?

00:37.304 --> 00:38.504
A story?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.606
Yeah. One of your special
Christmas stories.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.776
I'm not sure our tree
is quite finished yet.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.644
There's one thing left…

00:48.115 --> 00:49.915
The Christmas star!

00:54.989 --> 00:57.823
This is a very special star.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.092
It's been in our family
for generations.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.927
It's beautiful.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.328
My parents let me put it up
on the tree

01:03.397 --> 01:05.364
when I was a little girl.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.000
Your father put it on the tree
when he was a boy.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.402
Now you're old enough,
it's your turn.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.904
Really?

01:11.972 --> 01:15.040
Someday, Samantha, you'll
pass this on to your children.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.476
Because it's a tradition.

01:17.511 --> 01:23.582
And traditions are the stories
that families write together.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.250
So, are you ready?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.673 --> 01:47.306
Our tradition.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.557
Yes, I'd like to confirm
my reservation.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.860
Samantha Murphy.

02:07.895 --> 02:08.994
That's right!

02:09.029 --> 02:10.696
The main lodge,
for the week of Christmas.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.431
Thank you so much.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.260
I've always been partial
to the star.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.327
Oh, hi Samantha!

02:42.363 --> 02:43.428
Merry Christmas!

02:43.464 --> 02:44.596
Merry Christmas.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.098
I always have a tough time
deciding.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.634
Victoria's waiting for you.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.501
I'll walk you in.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.769
Great.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.705
So, how are you?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.340
I'm good.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.910
Well, let me get
right to it, Sam.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.711
When we published
your book last year,

02:59.747 --> 03:02.581
we knew we'd found a talented
new writer with her own voice,

03:02.616 --> 03:04.249
and a lovely story to tell.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.352
And, fortunately,
our readers agreed.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.155
Oh, that is so nice to hear.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.256
Thank you.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.724
Now, you know that
every Christmas,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.826
we publish a slate
of holiday books.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.030
These projects are very popular
with our readers.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.565
Obviously, we have to put
together titles

03:19.600 --> 03:21.500
a year in advance,

03:21.535 --> 03:23.769
and this year, we'd like you

03:23.804 --> 03:25.704
to write one of our
Christmas books.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.439
Your work has so much heart.

03:27.474 --> 03:30.409
Your characters are so…
authentic.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.777
It's a perfect fit.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.378
Well, I've…

03:33.414 --> 03:34.980
I've never actually written a
Christmas story before, so…

03:35.015 --> 03:36.048
That's the best part.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.516
We take your fresh voice,

03:37.551 --> 03:40.319
add just the right touch
of mistletoe and holly?

03:40.354 --> 03:41.687
Our readers will love it.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.556
And what better time to come up
with ideas than now?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.091
Everywhere you turn,
it's Christmas!

03:46.126 --> 03:47.693
Everywhere you turn.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.861
You're a wonderful writer, Sam.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.296
I really want this to work out.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.166
For both of us.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.601
Okay.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.668
I'm in.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.936
Good.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.371
Well, you have yourself
a holly, jolly Christmas

03:59.406 --> 04:01.206
and get those creative juices
flowing.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.841
We'll talk again at
the beginning of the year.

04:02.876 --> 04:03.742
Merry Christmas!

04:03.811 --> 04:05.877
Merry Christmas.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.218
<i>Congratulations!</i>

04:13.254 --> 04:16.288
<i>I mean, that seems like a great
opportunity for you.</i>

04:16.357 --> 04:17.422
Simon, it is.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.826
Writers wait years
for a chance like this.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.528
It's just… it's
a Christmas book.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.663
Ahh.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.265
That's difficult.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.432
Yeah.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.134
It's just I write from
a place of inspiration.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.502
It has to feel real.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.271
And how am I… how am I
supposed to write about this

04:32.339 --> 04:36.675
when Christmas hasn't felt
like Christmas in years?

04:36.710 --> 04:37.976
Before my parents divorced,

04:38.012 --> 04:39.645
we would go to my Nana's house

04:39.680 --> 04:41.713
and she had this list
of traditions

04:41.749 --> 04:43.348
we would all do as a family,

04:43.384 --> 04:46.084
and we would check them off
as we finished.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.152
That's a great memory.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.187
It was so great.

04:49.223 --> 04:52.491
And… the holiday shuffle
took over.

04:52.526 --> 04:57.162
My sister and I were bouncing
from mom and dad's.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.631
I mean, we tried to
I the traditions alive,

04:59.700 --> 05:03.435
it just… it was never
the same.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.539
I know how much you miss
your grandmother.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.808
Especially now that the holidays
are here.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.644
Just… it won't feel
like Christmas without her.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.413
And now that dad's selling
the house,

05:14.448 --> 05:17.349
there'll just… there'll be
nothing left to go back to.

05:17.384 --> 05:21.787
That is why you and I are going
to Aspen to celebrate Christmas.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.422
It's going to be our
first Christmas together,

05:23.457 --> 05:26.725
and I intend to make it very
special for the both of us.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.826
Who knows?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.728
It might spark some ideas
for your book.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.263
But what if I can't write it?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.431
Or…

05:32.499 --> 05:35.133
What if… you write
a really great book?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.502
You'll be famous,
always on the road,

05:37.538 --> 05:41.173
signing books, speaking to your
hordes of adoring fans…

05:41.241 --> 05:44.109
we'll never see each other…

05:44.144 --> 05:45.677
You know what, you're right.
Don't write it.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.912
Terrible idea!

05:48.749 --> 05:50.615
Don't write it at all.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.118
Thank you for making me
feel better.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.853
I'm your biggest fan.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.423
Oh.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.230
One guess.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.465
You're producer.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.632
News never sleeps.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.234
…and the most handsome
newsman

06:09.269 --> 06:11.703
in all of New York City is mine.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.372
I'm just an in-the-field guy.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.708
I'm gonna get that anchor job,
and you, my dear,

06:16.744 --> 06:19.010
are gonna write
a great Christmas book.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.217
Taxi!

06:26.987 --> 06:27.619
Bye.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.387
Bye.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.223
Hi.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.778
Here we go.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.987
Now we're talkin'.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.137
Hey, sis.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.605
Hey! Am I interrupting?

07:20.641 --> 07:21.840
<i>Uh, nope.</i>

07:21.875 --> 07:23.141
Just..

07:23.177 --> 07:24.943
Taking a little break.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.077
How are you doing?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.479
Great, you know.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.181
Just trying to wrangle a
class full of third graders

07:29.216 --> 07:31.349
for story-time on the last day of
school before Christmas break…

07:31.385 --> 07:32.751
Have a good Christmas!

07:34.321 --> 07:35.854
I can only imagine.

07:35.889 --> 07:36.988
Yeah.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.824
Did you, per chance,
read your mail yet?

07:38.859 --> 07:39.958
My mail?

07:39.993 --> 07:40.792
No.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.394
Why?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.663
You're gonna want to read
your mail.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.135
Hey, Kiddo.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.571
I thought I might hear
from you today.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.906
Hey dad.

07:54.942 --> 07:58.009
So, what do you make
of Nana's invite?

07:58.045 --> 07:59.211
Yeah.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.747
I talked to her lawyer, and uh,

08:02.783 --> 08:04.816
looks like she set all
this up in August

08:04.852 --> 08:07.652
while he was there helping her
to set up her estate.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.124
She always had somethin' up
her sleeve.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.994
Well, you know your grandmother.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.729
Yes, I do.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.198
It won't be the same
without Nana, but…

08:20.267 --> 08:23.935
this'll be our last chance
to spend Christmas at her house.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.137
And I think it would mean a lot
to your grandmother for us

08:26.206 --> 08:28.240
to be together again.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.875
Then I'll be there, dad.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.409
Great.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.943
Okay, sweetie, I love you.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.145
<i>See you soon.</i>

08:34.181 --> 08:35.514
Love you too.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.328
those holiday treats

08:50.364 --> 08:52.264
that you loved so much as a kid,

08:52.299 --> 08:54.900
may be as close as your nearest
street corner.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.501
I'm Simon Baker in Manhattan

08:56.537 --> 08:59.905
wishing you a very
merry Christmas.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.373
We're out.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.807
That was pretty good.

09:03.810 --> 09:04.509
Hey!

09:04.578 --> 09:05.443
That was great.

09:05.479 --> 09:06.278
Yeah? Thank you.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.913
Yeah.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.850
There have been a change
of plans for the holidays.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.184
Okay?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.687
So, my Nana made arrangements
for the whole family

09:15.722 --> 09:17.956
to spend one last Christmas
together at her house

09:17.991 --> 09:19.357
in Cedar Ridge, so…

09:19.426 --> 09:20.458
Wow.

09:20.494 --> 09:21.826
Aspen will have to wait.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.596
Well, one last Christmas
at your grandmother's house,

09:24.631 --> 09:25.597
that sounds great.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.598
Yeah.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.933
Colorado will always be there.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.367
I think this is way
more important.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.969
You're not too disappointed?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.137
Nah.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.005
I know how much you love
your grandmother.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.041
I think this is a really
good way to honour her.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.108
Thank you.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.677
Besides, I think it's about time

09:38.712 --> 09:40.779
that I see that hometown
of yours, don't you?

09:40.847 --> 09:41.546
What?

09:41.582 --> 09:42.314
Yeah!

09:42.349 --> 09:43.048
You wanna go with me?

09:43.083 --> 09:43.982
I do!

09:44.017 --> 09:45.317
What about your family?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.519
It doesn't really matter
where I spend Christmas,

09:47.588 --> 09:49.421
as long as I get to spend it
with you.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.089
And, besides, I love
your family.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.791
You're the best.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.593
I don't know about that.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.161
You're the best!

09:56.196 --> 09:57.362
Well… maybe.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.766
Thank you.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.234
This is his diner.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.635
Nice to meet you, Ben.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.737
Oh, pleasure's all mine.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.640
I don't suppose Samantha told
you how her literary aspirations

11:15.676 --> 11:17.876
blossomed right here,
in this very diner?

11:17.944 --> 11:19.110
No, she didn't.

11:20.614 --> 11:21.846
Well, see that booth over there?

11:21.915 --> 11:22.881
<i>Hmm-Mm.</i>

11:24.251 --> 11:26.718
Back in high school, she would
sit there for hours.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.853
Hardly ever looked up
from her laptop.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.523
That is true.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.791
Yes.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.159
Well, we're on our way
to the house to see dad,

11:34.194 --> 11:37.929
and I was hoping to bring him
a surprise?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.097
Ah, say no more!

11:39.966 --> 11:40.865
What's the surprise?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.067
You'll see.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.001
There it is!

11:43.036 --> 11:44.836
Here you go.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.605
It's my family's own secret
recipe holiday eggnog.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.474
Aaah! Let me…

11:49.509 --> 11:50.742
Oh, no!

11:50.777 --> 11:51.876
It's on the house.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.611
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

11:53.647 --> 11:54.345
Merry Christmas.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.080
Thank you.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.247
Merry Christmas!

11:56.283 --> 11:58.817
Aw, it's so good…
so good to see you.

11:58.852 --> 11:59.784
It's so good to see you,
darling.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.985
Thank you, Ben!

12:01.021 --> 12:02.220
Merry Christmas, Ben.
Great to meet you..

12:02.255 --> 12:04.089
- All right.
- All right.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.465
Wow.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.899
It's beautiful.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.670
Yeah. It is.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.105
Come on.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.419
Dad?

12:37.791 --> 12:38.623
There she is!

12:38.692 --> 12:39.524
Ah!

12:39.559 --> 12:40.558
Aah.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.659
Awe.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.495
Hey dad.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.763
How are you?

12:44.798 --> 12:47.465
Oh, better for seeing you.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.767
Simon. Welcome.

12:48.802 --> 12:49.634
Good to see you.

12:49.669 --> 12:50.602
Hey, good to see you too, Bill.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.570
We come bearing gifts.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.740
Mmm-Hm, Ben's eggnog.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.009
Well, now it really
is Christmas.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.511
Thank you, honey.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.211
Yeah.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.679
Well, I'm going to, uh,

13:01.748 --> 13:03.481
put the bags away and give you
two a chance to catch up?

13:03.550 --> 13:04.149
'Kay.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.050
Oh, thanks, Simon.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.119
Okay. Uh, Sam's room is
top of the stairs,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.320
first door on the right,

13:09.356 --> 13:10.421
and the guest room's
at the end of the hall.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.222
Ok.

13:11.258 --> 13:11.890
Be back in a minute.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.458
Okay.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.859
Thanks, sweetie.

13:16.730 --> 13:17.896
So.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.597
When is mom getting here?

13:19.633 --> 13:22.333
Actually, she is coming
with Annie and Mark,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.836
and they should be here
any time soon.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.006
Are you sure you're okay
with all of that?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.808
Why wouldn't I be?

13:29.843 --> 13:32.310
I mean, you haven't been
in this house together

13:32.345 --> 13:33.745
since the divorce.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.414
Well, since your mom moved
her practice to Connecticut,

13:36.449 --> 13:39.517
it's not like we actually travel
in the same circles anymore.

13:39.553 --> 13:42.687
You know what I mean.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.422
Yeah.

13:45.692 --> 13:46.658
Sam.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.794
Your mom and I just…
grew apart.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.697
But that doesn't mean we can't
spend Christmas together.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.199
Especially when it meant so much
to your Grandmother

13:54.234 --> 13:56.000
to have us all here.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.168
Yeah.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.938
Nana and your mom were always
very close.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.375
I see you got started
on the lights.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.510
Yes.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.478
Hmm, I thought, well,
since we're here,

14:07.514 --> 14:09.180
why not hang a little
Christmas cheer?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.349
Do you want some help?

14:11.384 --> 14:12.550
I was hoping you'd ask.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.119
Okay.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.654
Oh, here we go.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.697
You almost finished the ribbons,
sweetie?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.165
Workin' on it.

14:32.138 --> 14:32.971
Ah!

14:33.039 --> 14:34.339
They're here!

14:47.153 --> 14:48.853
Ahhhh!

14:48.889 --> 14:51.589
It's beginning to look a lot
like Christmas!

14:51.625 --> 14:53.391
How are you?

14:53.426 --> 14:54.826
<i>It's been too long!
Looking good.</i>

14:54.895 --> 14:56.094
You too.

14:56.129 --> 14:56.761
Hey, Sam?

14:56.796 --> 14:57.829
How's it going?

14:57.864 --> 14:58.696
Hi Mark!

14:58.732 --> 14:59.564
Simon, how are you?

14:59.599 --> 15:00.798
Thank you so much for coming!

15:00.834 --> 15:01.866
Good to see ya!

15:01.902 --> 15:02.901
Mom!

15:02.969 --> 15:04.502
Sweetheart, oh!

15:04.537 --> 15:06.137
I am so glad you're here.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.606
I'm so glad you are here.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.442
Oh, and Simon.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.443
<i>How are you, sweetie?</i>

15:12.512 --> 15:13.544
I'm good, how are you?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.913
So happy you could
join us for this.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.848
All the stories that Sam's
told me about this house?

15:16.883 --> 15:18.483
I had to see it for myself.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.452
Yeah, there's a good
many memories here.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.487
I bet.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.388
Yeah.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.423
There sure are.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.958
Hello, Bill.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.160
Claire.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.502
Hey, uh, look what Mark made
for all of us!

15:37.570 --> 15:38.269
Right! Yes indeed.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.272
Oh, yes, it's gorgeous.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.106
What do ya' think?

15:42.175 --> 15:42.840
Hey!

15:42.876 --> 15:43.808
That's beautiful!

15:43.843 --> 15:45.476
That's so nice.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.045
Thank you. Yes.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.479
Merry Christmas.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.216
Uh, let me help with your,
uh… your luggage.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.918
No, I've got it.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.692
Yeah, I'd be honoured.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.126
Thank you.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.735
So, a Christmas book.

16:10.804 --> 16:11.869
That's kind of cool.

16:11.905 --> 16:12.837
Yeah.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.372
It is.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.741
I'm just… I'm having
a little trouble

16:16.776 --> 16:19.877
getting into the spirit
it needs.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.046
Yeah, I miss Nana too.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.348
Feels like she should be calling
us downstairs

16:23.383 --> 16:25.216
to have hot chocolate right now.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.986
Or going for a walk
through the snow,

16:28.021 --> 16:29.787
looking at all the
Christmas decorations.

16:29.823 --> 16:30.621
Oh, yeah.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.558
But hey.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.926
Maybe going back there
will make it better.

16:34.961 --> 16:38.830
Plus, Simon's here,
so that's inspirational, right?

16:38.865 --> 16:40.331
Why?

16:40.367 --> 16:41.065
Stop it!

16:41.134 --> 16:42.367
Well, I'm just saying,

16:42.435 --> 16:44.502
it's a big step to bring him
home for Christmas.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.638
I mean, are there wedding bells
in your future?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.340
I think those are sleigh bells.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.375
Dad hung them on the door.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.376
Okay.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.343
Seriously.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.745
You've been dating for a year,

16:53.813 --> 16:55.279
you cannot tell me that you
haven't talked about it.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.315
We haven't talked about it.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.017
We both have a lot on
our plates right now;

16:59.085 --> 17:00.718
I have a book I have to figure
out how to write,

17:00.754 --> 17:03.521
and he is always on call
with his job.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.454
Sam…

17:04.457 --> 17:06.391
ni

17:06.425 --> 17:07.592
Trust me.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.527
Simon and I are on the same page
about this.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.563
Marriage is just not
in the picture right now.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.165
Okay.

17:18.471 --> 17:22.573
<i>…Yeah, I'll stick around
for that, of course.</i>

17:22.608 --> 17:26.010
<i>Sure, uh-huh.</i>

17:26.046 --> 17:27.244
Yeah, sure thing, Jack.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.047
You keep me posted.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.548
Great.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.117
Sorry, that was my news director
from back at the station.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.585
Everything okay?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.987
There's a crazy coincidence.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.356
There's a local Christmas
story here.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.257
In Cedar Ridge?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.425
In Cedar Ridge.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.759
And they want me to cover it
while I'm here.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.227
It would air on Christmas Eve,

17:43.296 --> 17:45.430
so this is a much bigger story
than I've ever had before.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.297
That's amazing!

17:46.332 --> 17:47.198
Yeah!

17:47.267 --> 17:48.966
And, believe me, this…

17:49.002 --> 17:50.868
This is a really nice story.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.839
So… what do you think?

17:54.874 --> 17:59.510
I think that it's going to be
your best story yet.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.645
I think so too.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.814
Thank you.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.317
So, this… this past year.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.285
Yeah?

18:07.353 --> 18:11.622
It's, um, it's been good, right?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.991
Where did that just come from?

18:14.027 --> 18:17.995
I just… I mean, you're happy
with the way things are?

18:18.064 --> 18:19.964
We're on the same page, right?

18:20.033 --> 18:21.732
Yeah, of course.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.900
I couldn't be happier.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.235
Okay.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.040
Ooh, something's being
delivered.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.309
<i>Maybe an early Christmas
present.</i>

18:32.579 --> 18:34.545
I wonder who it's for?

18:42.322 --> 18:42.954
Hey!

18:42.989 --> 18:44.288
Hey!

18:44.324 --> 18:46.891
We, uh, we got a package;
it's from Nana's lawyer.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.726
What does it say?

18:50.196 --> 18:51.095
Ah, here.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.263
Thanks.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.166
Hmm.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.373
It's a letter.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.542
Oh. Well, read it, Sammy.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.246
"My dear family.

19:08.314 --> 19:13.151
"Merry Christmas
and welcome home.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.887
"It's been much too long
since you were all together.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.556
"I only wish I could be
with you.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.892
"I ask that you put aside
your sadness,

19:20.927 --> 19:25.463
"and enjoy Christmas the way
we always used to.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.100
"Just in case you forgot,
I've included a list.

19:29.135 --> 19:33.104
"My wish is for you to complete
this list as a family."

19:39.546 --> 19:40.945
What's the list?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.181
Oh!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.050
Oh my gosh, that's all of
our old Christmas traditions.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.286
"Put up all the Christmas
decorations."

19:48.354 --> 19:51.422
"Pick a tree from Finch's Farm
and decorate it."

19:51.491 --> 19:53.858
"Make gingerbread cookies."

19:53.893 --> 19:55.793
"Drink Nana's hot apple cider."

19:55.828 --> 19:56.827
Of course!

19:56.863 --> 19:58.596
"Go ice skating."

19:58.631 --> 19:59.964
Um, ya?

20:02.936 --> 20:06.337
"Get our family picture with
Santa at Benjamin's Diner."

20:06.372 --> 20:08.973
"Go to the Cedar Ridge
Christmas Dance!"

20:09.008 --> 20:10.007
"I love you with all my heart,

20:10.043 --> 20:13.444
"Merry Christmas and God Bless.
Nana."

20:13.479 --> 20:14.412
Wow.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.913
Yeah.

20:15.949 --> 20:19.984
Your grandmother always knew how
to make Christmas special.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.886
It'll be like old times.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.208
Hey.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.476
Hey!

20:45.545 --> 20:48.112
What are you doing?

20:48.181 --> 20:52.383
Just… looking over the list.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.655
It's like I could hear her
voice again.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.258
"Brought back all these
memories.

21:00.293 --> 21:05.796
"Traditions are the stories
that families write together."

21:05.832 --> 21:07.832
Something she used to say.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.367
Hmm.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.468
I like that.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.669
Yeah.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.405
Well, she'd like you.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.408
I'm glad you think so.

21:19.312 --> 21:24.915
Because, I wanna start a new
Christmas tradition.

21:24.951 --> 21:25.816
Okay.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.651
For us.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.653
Okay.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.191
Are you okay?

21:34.227 --> 21:35.726
I had a whole speech prepared,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.195
and suddenly I can't remember
a word.

21:38.264 --> 21:42.133
But, uh… Samantha.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.870
I love you.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.973
And I want to spend the rest
of our lives together.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.383
Will you marry me?

22:01.421 --> 22:04.488
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

22:04.524 --> 22:06.290
Oh!

22:06.326 --> 22:08.025
Yes. Yes!

22:08.094 --> 22:09.060
Yes!

22:09.095 --> 22:12.063
- Yes? Yes? Yes!!!
- Oh, my gosh!

22:12.098 --> 22:13.464
<i>That is fantastic!</i>

22:13.533 --> 22:15.199
- Oh my gosh, congratulations!
- Congratulations, guys!

22:40.426 --> 22:41.826
Morning.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.828
Good morning.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.663
Still an early riser, I see.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.164
You too.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.566
Old habits.

22:51.938 --> 22:55.706
Uh… So the girls tell me that
your practice is doing well.

22:55.742 --> 22:56.674
Yeah.

22:56.709 --> 23:01.112
You know… busy.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.314
And… how's retirement?

23:03.349 --> 23:06.050
<i>Are you missing life with the
Cedar Ridge police department?</i>

23:06.085 --> 23:08.452
<i>Well, some days I still get
a little antsy,</i>

23:08.521 --> 23:12.456
<i>but no, it's… it's going
pretty well.</i>

23:12.492 --> 23:14.992
Gives me lots of time to do
other things.

23:15.027 --> 23:18.829
It must be a nice change,
not running out at all hours,

23:18.898 --> 23:21.599
on call 24/7, cop on the beat.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.001
Well, it was my job, Claire.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.636
<i>And as I recall,</i>

23:25.671 --> 23:29.039
<i>we were both kept pretty busy
there after the girls moved out</i>

23:29.108 --> 23:31.275
I was trying to make partner.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.718
You know, I think I will take a
walk before we start decorating.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.686
It's pretty cold out there.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.788
Yes.

23:43.823 --> 23:44.755
I know.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.424
It's winter.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.793
But, uh, I'll be fine.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.294
Thanks.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.325
Hey!

24:21.360 --> 24:22.026
Sam!

24:22.061 --> 24:23.260
Hey, there you are.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.528
Here I am.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.197
I was just thinking about
the best way for us

24:26.265 --> 24:28.299
to tell my parents.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.600
Right.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.735
Your parents.

24:31.771 --> 24:32.770
I was pretty excited last night,

24:32.805 --> 24:33.637
so I emailed them
to let them know

24:33.706 --> 24:35.906
we have some pretty big news.

24:35.942 --> 24:39.944
Wow, this is… all happening
so fast.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.514
So I was thinking we could call
them and tell them together?

24:43.583 --> 24:46.584
Yeah. Sure.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.687
Hey! Don't worry,
they love you, Sam.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.056
They're gonna be so excited
about all of this.

24:53.860 --> 24:54.859
Come here.

25:01.434 --> 25:02.766
Got enough lights there, Bill?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.835
We'll be able to be seen
from space at night.

25:04.871 --> 25:09.206
Well, Mark, you can never have
too many Christmas lights.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.942
Uh, that's not true
actually dad, remember?

25:11.978 --> 25:13.444
Remember what?

25:13.479 --> 25:15.045
Uh, oh nothing.

25:15.081 --> 25:15.646
Nothing.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.214
No, no, n-no.

25:17.250 --> 25:20.251
When Annie and I were kids, dad
put up so many Christmas lights,

25:20.319 --> 25:22.853
he actually blew the fuse box
in the house.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.688
Okay, that is an exaggeration.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.689
No!

25:25.758 --> 25:26.857
We had to eat dinner
by candlelight,

25:26.926 --> 25:28.792
and we had no electricity
for two days.

25:28.828 --> 25:29.960
Not how I remember it.

25:29.996 --> 25:30.861
Of course.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.898
So, have you two picked
a date yet?

25:33.933 --> 25:34.698
Mom!

25:34.734 --> 25:35.366
What?

25:35.401 --> 25:37.034
We just got engaged!

25:37.069 --> 25:38.869
Well, what about
a summer wedding?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.971
Which is six months from now!

25:41.007 --> 25:42.139
Six months is plenty.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.141
Yeah, but then you get
into June showers.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.476
No, no, no, no.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.245
It's April showers,
that ends with May flowers.

25:48.281 --> 25:50.180
Which, by the way,
is a good thing.

25:50.216 --> 25:50.915
Right.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.383
Mm-mm.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.085
Spring or summer, you should
not have an outdoor wedding.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.086
Trust me.

25:56.122 --> 25:56.887
Ugh.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.956
Not this again, Claire.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.859
Bill insisted on
an outdoor wedding.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.027
I just wanted something
beautiful,

26:03.062 --> 26:04.261
is that so bad?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.063
I told him you can't have
an outdoor wedding

26:06.132 --> 26:07.464
during rainy season.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.099
But would he listen to me?

26:09.135 --> 26:10.434
Of course not.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.436
I just wanted this one thing.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.271
It rained on us.

26:14.307 --> 26:15.706
And I thought that was romantic.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.341
My hair didn't think so.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.347
You know what?

26:23.382 --> 26:27.318
I'll, uh, put a few of these
lights back.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.053
Yeah, dad. I'm gonna
help you.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.591
Okay.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.222
It's a long list, so where
should we start?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.324
- We should get our tree first.
- Gingerbread men, definitely.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.460
We always decorate
our tree first.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.095
Well, the house always
smells so nice…

27:13.733 --> 27:15.899
Okay, so now what do we do?

27:18.070 --> 27:19.470
Ice skating.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.305
Oh, yes!

27:25.611 --> 27:27.511
Ice skating it is.

I Think it's only fair
to remind you

27:55.207 --> 27:58.709
that I did play one season
of pee-wee hockey.

27:58.744 --> 28:01.011
Is this the same season
you broke your arm?

28:01.047 --> 28:02.880
Shortest hockey career
ever recorded.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.183
Oh, hey.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.953
In all the excitement, we did
forget one very important thing.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.423
What's that?

28:12.458 --> 28:13.390
This.

28:13.426 --> 28:14.391
Supposed to go on your finger.

28:14.427 --> 28:15.626
Right?

28:15.661 --> 28:17.728
Uh, yeah, um…
umm.

28:17.797 --> 28:18.662
I hope it fits.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.097
It was my grandmother's.

28:20.132 --> 28:23.233
My grandfather had it specially
made for their wedding.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.005
Wow, it's um…

28:28.040 --> 28:29.807
It's beautiful.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.342
My mom told me to use one of
your rings to get it sized,

28:32.378 --> 28:33.444
but since you don't wear rings

28:33.479 --> 28:35.612
I kind of had to eyeball it, so.

28:35.648 --> 28:36.947
I think it works.

28:36.982 --> 28:37.881
Okay.

28:37.917 --> 28:38.816
Let's do this.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.050
Let's hit the ice!

28:48.828 --> 28:50.160

28:50.229 --> 28:53.130
This feels good, to be back
out on the ice, right?

28:53.199 --> 28:56.400
Look, I… I was wanting to talk
to you actually,

28:56.435 --> 28:58.902
about something that-

28:58.971 --> 28:59.636
Woo!

28:59.672 --> 29:01.438
Oh, she was fast.

29:01.474 --> 29:02.339
You okay?

29:02.374 --> 29:03.307
Yeah.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.809
Uh…

29:05.878 --> 29:09.680
So… I was just wanting
to talk to you, remember?

29:09.715 --> 29:11.582
When my parents were talking
about the date?

29:11.650 --> 29:12.983
Yeah.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.619
Well, I just thought it might
be nice if we had a…

29:15.654 --> 29:17.187
a long engagement.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.089
What?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.491
Where's this coming from?

29:20.559 --> 29:22.459
Uh, there's just a lot going on.

29:22.528 --> 29:25.329
You know, I mean my parents
are, they're like strangers,

29:25.364 --> 29:28.799
and I miss my grandmother,
and… and I can't write.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.201
Being back here,
it's just is, it's a lot.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.936
I keep waiting for Christmas
to feel like Christmas

29:32.972 --> 29:36.940
and I just don't know if…
if now is… is the right time.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.108
Okay?

29:38.177 --> 29:39.343
Um, look, I understand.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.578
You've got a lot going on
right now.

29:41.647 --> 29:44.715
I do, but, we just… we never
talked about this.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.183
You know?

29:46.252 --> 29:49.219
And it just all seems to be
happening like, really fast.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.554
It's a big step.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.856
And if you… if you need
more time…

29:54.527 --> 29:56.093
You guys ready to go
for a whirl?

29:56.162 --> 29:57.661
Another Murphy family tradition?

29:57.696 --> 29:59.363
I hope the rest of the list
is this fun.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.597
Come on, you two.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.932
Okay.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.071
I'm sorry.

30:08.107 --> 30:11.542
Let's… let's talk about it
when we get home.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.377
Okay?

30:23.823 --> 30:26.023
Hey, mom, you looked
amazing out there.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.024
Oh, please.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.926
No, you did not miss a step.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.495
Or should I say "stride?"

30:31.564 --> 30:34.298
The only thing missing was that
red ribbon you used to wear

30:34.366 --> 30:35.966
in your hair.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.205
I remember that.

30:52.251 --> 30:56.286
♫

30:56.322 --> 30:57.955
Okay.

30:57.990 --> 31:04.862
♫

31:04.897 --> 31:07.197
Nana's hot apple cider,
coming right up.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.966
Here.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.234
This looks amazing.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.802
But remember, we are not
done decorating

31:11.837 --> 31:14.471
until we go to Finch's and pick
out the perfect Christmas tree.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.839
It's on the list.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.708
Hey, Sam, remember the first
time Nana took us there?

31:19.111 --> 31:21.044
And we thought all those trees
were a Christmas forest?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.813
It started snowing,
and we were convinced

31:22.848 --> 31:25.682
we were gonna actually find
a real life reindeer.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.723
Uh, is Simon still in the garage
getting boxes?

31:32.758 --> 31:35.259
Oh, no, uh, I said I was going
to go chop

31:35.327 --> 31:38.128
some more firewood for later,
and he offered to do it.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.463
I could help.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.199
Um, you know what?

31:42.268 --> 31:45.769
I'll ask, and see if he wants
some hot apple cider.

32:05.991 --> 32:07.557
Hi.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.027
Hey.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.462
I, um, brought you some cider.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.871
It's good.

32:20.906 --> 32:23.840
How long have you been thinking
about proposing?

32:23.876 --> 32:26.476
Since Christmas Eve last year.

32:29.315 --> 32:32.349
That's… that's the first time
we met.

32:34.887 --> 32:37.220
Sam, if it's a question
of a little more time,

32:37.256 --> 32:39.723
I can give you that.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.725
How much time do you need?

32:44.430 --> 32:47.130
I don't know.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.866
Look, why can't we go back
to the way things were

32:49.902 --> 32:51.101
just a few days ago?

32:51.136 --> 32:58.108
You said you were happy
with the way things are.

32:58.143 --> 33:02.412
I, uh, I told Jack that I would
do this Christmas story for him.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.247
So I'm gonna finish it up.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.917
Then I think it's best
if I leave.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.121
I, I'll go spend Christmas
with my family,

33:11.156 --> 33:14.257
and we can talk when we
both get back to the city.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.059
Really?

33:16.095 --> 33:17.961
I think that's best.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.032
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

33:25.204 --> 33:26.470
I'm gonna finish up here.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.305
I'll be in in a sec.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.339
Okay.

33:40.986 --> 33:44.154
♫

34:11.016 --> 34:14.083
Hey! How's the Christmas book
coming?

34:14.119 --> 34:15.886
Not great.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.021
Not great, why?

34:19.925 --> 34:21.690
What's wrong?

34:21.726 --> 34:25.027
I think Simon may have broken up
with me last night.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.263
What?!

34:26.297 --> 34:30.434
Oh, my gosh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

34:30.469 --> 34:31.534
'Kay, wait, wait. Woah.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.437
Why would he do that?

34:33.472 --> 34:36.139
I might have told him that
I didn't know if I was ready

34:36.175 --> 34:37.841
to get married yet.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.177
Yep, that would probably do it.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.945
Amy, what is wrong with me?

34:41.980 --> 34:44.147
Nothing is wrong with you.

34:44.216 --> 34:44.947
Hey.

34:44.983 --> 34:47.451
I know you.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.420
You're just worried
about getting hurt again.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.054
Look at what happened with Paul.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.857
I know the breakup with Paul
hurt you,

34:53.891 --> 34:55.625
but Simon is not Paul.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.427
A mom and dad?

34:57.463 --> 34:58.462
Yeah.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.668
I love him, and I want
to be ready.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.838
I just don't know if Simon
is willing to wait

35:07.873 --> 35:09.739
for that day to come.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.308
Yeah.

35:11.376 --> 35:12.876
Please don't tell everyone else.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.411
Of course, no. I would never.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.178
Thank you.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.246
You're welcome.

35:16.315 --> 35:19.049
Tell everyone else…

35:19.118 --> 35:21.685
Uh, that we were gonna start
without you

35:21.753 --> 35:23.420
to make gingerbread men?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.592
<i>Sam's really impatient.</i>

35:28.594 --> 35:29.926
Yeah.

35:32.431 --> 35:37.567
♫

35:37.636 --> 35:40.337
♫

35:40.372 --> 35:42.639
Your grandmother used to make

35:42.674 --> 35:44.608
THE best gingerbread cookies

35:44.643 --> 35:46.042
I have ever tasted.

35:46.078 --> 35:47.744
Yeah, but she would
never tell us the recipe.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.779
She always just said
it's a family secret.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.214
Did she ever tell you, dad?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.716
Oh, are you kidding?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.619
I wasn't even allowed in the
kitchen when she was baking.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.355
I used to always stick
my fingers in the batter,

35:58.390 --> 35:59.789
and take it, and…

35:59.825 --> 36:01.525
She always made enough
for you to take cookies

36:01.560 --> 36:03.560
to the station house
every Christmas.

36:03.595 --> 36:04.728
That is true.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.130
I was always very popular
at the holidays.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.331
See, Sam?

36:08.367 --> 36:09.466
That's what you need to put
in your book.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.700
What book?

36:13.172 --> 36:14.738
It's… nothing.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.039
Ohh.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.340
Sam had a meeting with her
publisher this week,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.209
and they want her to do another
book for them.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.577
Doesn't sound like nothing.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.512
Sweetheart, that's wonderful.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.980
Well, I'm just getting started,
so…

36:24.016 --> 36:24.814
Congratulations, kiddo!

36:24.850 --> 36:27.317
What's it about?

36:27.352 --> 36:28.785
Uh, it's a Christmas romance.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.053
Oh!

36:30.088 --> 36:31.788
That's gonna write itself!

36:31.857 --> 36:34.558
I'll bet these last few days
have been very enlightening.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.059
Oh, you have no idea.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.096
Speaking of which, where
is that young man of yours?

36:40.132 --> 36:41.431
He's on the phone with his boss.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.133
They gave him a Christmas story
to do while he's here.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.601
Oh, you didn't say anything
about that.

36:44.636 --> 36:45.769
What kind of story?

36:45.804 --> 36:48.438
Heartwarming and home
for the holidays.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.906
It's my favourite kind.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.241
Simon!

36:51.310 --> 36:54.578
Pull up a chair and get yourself
a gingerbread man.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.947
Uh, I would love to, but
I've gotta go do some work

36:56.982 --> 36:57.881
on the story.

36:57.916 --> 36:58.615
Oh.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.916
Come on.

36:59.952 --> 37:02.285
It's fun, AND it's one of our
family traditions.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.153
Um…

37:06.458 --> 37:07.924
Okay.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.993
Yeah, I guess I, uh, can stick
around for a minute or two.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.929
I'll get you a paper.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.231
You know, you never said, Simon.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.233
Were your parents excited?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.601
Uh, about my story?

37:17.669 --> 37:21.304
No, silly, about you and Sam
getting engaged.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.872
Oh, uh, right.

37:22.941 --> 37:23.773
That.

37:23.809 --> 37:24.908
Um.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.276
You know, I haven't
told them yet.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.744
You haven't?

37:27.779 --> 37:28.912
I…

37:28.947 --> 37:29.746
Well, let's give them
a call right now.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.047
That's a great idea.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.650
Or… or better yet,
we could do a video call,

37:33.685 --> 37:34.818
and then we could all be
a part of it.

37:34.853 --> 37:35.785
Yes!

37:35.821 --> 37:37.687
I can't.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.622
Why not?

37:38.657 --> 37:39.956
Um.

37:39.992 --> 37:41.891
Uh. My, uh… my, my parents
are spending Christmas

37:41.927 --> 37:43.526
out at my Aunt Linda's,

37:43.562 --> 37:46.730
and the reception at her place
is not the best.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.833
So, otherwise I would have told
them right away, of course.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.434
Oh, that's too bad.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.769
I'm sure you're eager to share.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.670
I am, I am.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.605
I'm, uh, I'm very eager.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.439
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:56.475 --> 37:57.240
<i>Can I have the sprinkles?</i>

37:57.276 --> 37:59.376
<i>Yes, yes. Red or white?</i>

37:59.411 --> 38:01.244

38:48.393 --> 38:50.460
Sure.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.462
Are you working or hiding?

38:52.497 --> 38:53.730
Oh.

38:53.765 --> 38:58.168
Uh, doing a little bit of both.

38:58.203 --> 39:03.373
So, I'm, uh, I'm guessing
that Sam told you.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.441
Yeah.

39:04.476 --> 39:07.110
That can't be easy on either
of you.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.311
Well…

39:08.380 --> 39:11.848
Maybe it wasn't the best time
for a proposal.

39:11.883 --> 39:15.552
Mm, maybe.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.619
But?

39:18.023 --> 39:19.756
I think it's… it's really
important that you know

39:19.791 --> 39:22.125
Sam really does love you.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.928
Yeah. Just not enough
to marry me.

39:24.963 --> 39:25.895
Well, no.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.530
It's a little bit complicated.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.531
Yeah.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.066
She told me about Paul.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.868
Did she also tell you how days
before the wedding

39:31.937 --> 39:34.904
he just called it all off?

39:34.940 --> 39:36.272
No!

39:36.308 --> 39:37.540
Yeah.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.942
No, she didn't tell me that.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.543
That's awful.

39:40.579 --> 39:41.578
'Kay, look.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.913
Between that and my parents'
divorce,

39:43.982 --> 39:47.984
I mean, she lost her fiancé,
she lost her happy family,

39:48.019 --> 39:49.686
her perfect Christmas.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.554
Sam took it really hard.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.357
And I don't think she ever
really got over it.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.260
But I know my sister, and
I know she really wants to.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.028
She's just scared.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.631
Please, please do not give up
on her.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.733
And, I mean, it's Christmas.

40:03.769 --> 40:06.236

40:07.305 --> 40:08.405
Yeah.

40:29.561 --> 40:32.195

some work stuff to do, so…

40:32.264 --> 40:33.229
Ok.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.397
You know, that one's
pretty great.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.933
Oh, no, Bill, it needs
to be bigger.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.702
It doesn't matter how tall
it is, Claire.

40:39.738 --> 40:40.904

40:42.908 --> 40:44.040
Um, you're right.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.609

decorations

Hey everybody.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.416
Hey!

40:53.452 --> 40:54.584
Hey.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.852
Hey, I… I… I thought
you had to work.

40:55.887 --> 40:59.122
I did, uh, but I thought
this was more important.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.324
I mean, it's on the list, right?

41:01.359 --> 41:02.392
Great.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.460
Glad you're here.

41:03.495 --> 41:04.961
Um, fellas, why don't you
follow me,

41:05.030 --> 41:08.231
and we'll let the ladies gossip
about the wedding.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.265
Gotcha.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.567
<i>Sounds good.</i>

41:10.635 --> 41:12.302
Thank you.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.905
Speaking of gossip, you can
tell us how your date went

41:15.941 --> 41:16.940
the other night.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.141
You had a date?

41:18.210 --> 41:20.109
Honey, there's no need
to sound so surprised.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.579
It's not like I sit home
knitting every night.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.214
She doesn't know how to knit.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.715
Why didn't you tell me?

41:25.750 --> 41:26.850
You didn't ask!

41:26.885 --> 41:27.851
You knew?

41:27.886 --> 41:28.651
I know.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.420
So, who's the guy?

41:30.455 --> 41:32.589
Oh.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.625
His name is George.
He is another lawyer.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.828
I met him through work.

41:38.864 --> 41:42.765
He's a very nice man.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.602
So, you don't miss dad?

41:45.637 --> 41:46.903
Oh, sweetie.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.205
Of course I do.

41:49.241 --> 41:54.244
I'm just trying to move on
and make the most of my life.

41:54.312 --> 41:55.044
Oh.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.046
Look over there!

41:57.115 --> 41:59.349
Aw, they're setting up
for a wedding.

41:59.417 --> 42:01.584
A wedding at a Christmas tree
farm.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.720
What a wonderful idea.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.622
Don't you think so, Samantha?

42:05.690 --> 42:07.757
Yeah.

42:07.826 --> 42:10.960
Honey, you need to start
thinking about these things.

42:10.996 --> 42:15.565
Do you want an indoor
or an outdoor wedding?

42:15.600 --> 42:16.299
I don't…

42:16.334 --> 42:17.967
I don't know, um… I…

42:18.036 --> 42:19.202
<i>Found it!</i>

42:19.237 --> 42:21.404
Oh, she found it.

42:21.439 --> 42:23.006
It's perfect.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.707

42:24.776 --> 42:25.642
Perfect.

42:25.677 --> 42:26.376

<i>I know.</i>

42:49.568 --> 42:50.400
Oh.

42:50.435 --> 42:51.234
Sorry.

42:51.269 --> 42:52.135
No, no.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.469
Go ahead.

42:54.773 --> 42:57.340
Oh! Oh!

42:57.409 --> 42:59.542
Would you look at that.

42:59.578 --> 43:04.113
Samantha was so proud when she
brought this home from school.

43:04.182 --> 43:05.415
So proud.

43:07.986 --> 43:10.119
Look what I found.

43:11.623 --> 43:12.755
Oh!

43:12.791 --> 43:15.725
It's the family Santa album!

43:15.760 --> 43:17.794
Oh my gosh, that is going
way back.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.529
So far back!

43:19.564 --> 43:20.663
Santa album?

43:20.699 --> 43:22.365
Oh yes, it's one of our
family traditions,

43:22.400 --> 43:24.634
and it's on Nana's list.

43:24.669 --> 43:25.602
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

43:25.637 --> 43:26.502
No!

43:26.571 --> 43:27.670
Hello.

43:27.739 --> 43:29.072
Look at that hair!

43:29.107 --> 43:30.607
What?

43:30.642 --> 43:33.109
You don't love the beautiful
home perm that I gave myself?

43:33.178 --> 43:34.978
We used to go for breakfast
at Benjamin's Diner,

43:35.013 --> 43:37.513
and then the entire family
wod go for a Santa photo.

43:37.582 --> 43:38.681
Woah.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.717
Look at the big smiles
on those two!

43:40.752 --> 43:43.386
Mom clearly had a thing
for a man in uniform.

43:43.421 --> 43:46.556
Someone called in sick and your
father pulled a double shift,

43:46.591 --> 43:49.492
and we didn't see much of him
that Christmas.

43:49.527 --> 43:52.095
I was just happy to make
it there for the picture.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.564
Me too.

43:54.599 --> 43:55.231
Aww.

43:55.266 --> 43:57.033
All right guys.

43:57.068 --> 43:58.568
Let's finish up this tree.

43:58.603 --> 44:00.637
Uh, I don't know, kiddo.

44:00.672 --> 44:01.704
I think we're pretty good!

44:01.740 --> 44:03.873
Yeah, looks good to me.

44:05.110 --> 44:06.442
No, we haven't put up
Nana's star.

44:06.478 --> 44:07.243
Oh!

44:07.278 --> 44:08.077
Oh.

44:08.113 --> 44:09.579
Uh, you know what?

44:09.614 --> 44:10.713
I don't remember seeing that.

44:10.749 --> 44:12.448
It's not in any of these boxes.

44:12.517 --> 44:13.716
Well, I'm gonna go take a look.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.385
It's gotta be somewhere.

44:22.127 --> 44:23.993
Uh, Simon?

44:25.597 --> 44:29.532
Maybe you want to see if
she needs a little help?

44:29.567 --> 44:30.833
Oh.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.635
Yeah. I'm gonna go see if she
needs a hand.

44:32.671 --> 44:33.636
Okay great.

44:43.214 --> 44:45.148
Where did you put it?

44:48.787 --> 44:49.752
Hey.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.554
Any luck?

44:51.589 --> 44:53.456
Hey.

44:53.491 --> 44:55.425
You didn't have to come
and help.

44:55.460 --> 44:58.227
Seemed like the right thing
to do for a fiancé.

44:58.263 --> 44:59.962
Right.

44:59.998 --> 45:01.531
Thanks.

45:01.566 --> 45:03.599
Well, it could be anywhere.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.601
Why wouldn't she just leave it

45:05.637 --> 45:06.936
with the rest of the
Christmas ornaments?

45:06.971 --> 45:09.238
Maybe because it is so special?

45:09.274 --> 45:10.073
Yeah?

45:10.108 --> 45:11.174
How so?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.142
Well, ever since I was
a little kid,

45:13.178 --> 45:15.478
my Nana and I had this tradition
where she would let me put

45:15.513 --> 45:17.714
the Christmas star
on top of the tree.

45:17.749 --> 45:19.682
And then we would sit together,

45:19.751 --> 45:21.751
and she would tell me
one of her stories.

45:21.786 --> 45:22.985
Hmm.

45:23.021 --> 45:24.620
Does sound like a special star.

45:24.689 --> 45:25.922
Yes, it is.

45:25.990 --> 45:28.257
And we can't finish the
Christmas list without it.

45:34.299 --> 45:35.231
Uh-oh.

45:35.266 --> 45:37.033
What?

45:37.068 --> 45:38.434
It's my parents.

45:38.470 --> 45:39.435
Oh.

45:41.706 --> 45:42.472
Hi mom!

45:42.507 --> 45:43.639
<i>Hi honey.</i>

45:43.675 --> 45:45.441
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

45:45.477 --> 45:46.876
How are you doing?

45:48.279 --> 45:49.312
I'm good.

45:49.347 --> 45:50.646
I'm good.

45:50.715 --> 45:52.115
Uh, did you and dad make it
to Aunt Linda's okay?

45:52.150 --> 45:52.915
Oh, sure.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.016
The weather held off.

45:54.052 --> 45:55.318
We made it no problem.

45:55.353 --> 45:57.587
<i>Your dad just stepped out
for a minute.</i>

45:57.622 --> 46:01.324
But, I've just seen your email.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.392
You saw my email?

46:03.428 --> 46:05.294
You've got me sitting
on the edge of my seat,

46:05.330 --> 46:06.929
what's the big news?

46:06.965 --> 46:10.533
Right, uh, the big news.

46:10.568 --> 46:13.569
Um… The big news.

46:13.605 --> 46:16.172
Uh…

46:16.207 --> 46:18.307
Hi Laurie, it's Sam.

46:18.343 --> 46:19.809
Hi, Sam!

46:19.878 --> 46:21.377
Merry Christmas.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.412
Merry Christmas to you too.

46:23.448 --> 46:26.849
Um, Simon is… is way
too modest to tell you,

46:26.885 --> 46:28.117
<i>so… I will.</i>

46:28.153 --> 46:31.287
The station gave him
a Christmas Eve story

46:31.322 --> 46:36.092
and it's kind of a big deal
and a great opportunity.

46:36.127 --> 46:38.761
Surprise!

46:38.830 --> 46:39.862
Oh, that's great.

46:39.898 --> 46:41.731
That's so great, Sam.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.200
You know what they say about
the first Christmas together?

46:44.269 --> 46:47.436
It's always the most special.

46:47.472 --> 46:48.237
It is.

46:48.273 --> 46:50.106
It… it… it really is.

46:50.141 --> 46:53.843
You know, I've never seen him
happier than when he's with you.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.781
Merry Christmas, Samantha.

46:58.817 --> 47:01.083
Merry Christmas to you, too.

47:01.119 --> 47:02.485
Bye.

47:05.089 --> 47:08.024
You okay?

47:08.059 --> 47:09.058
Yeah.

47:10.695 --> 47:13.496
Well, that…
that was impressive.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.400
<i>Hey, you two!</i>

47:17.435 --> 47:20.436
<i>Better get back in here
before the eggnog's gone!</i>

47:20.505 --> 47:21.404
Shall we?

47:21.439 --> 47:22.438
Yeah.

47:32.951 --> 47:35.284
I think I'm gonna turn in.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.686
Are you sure?

47:36.721 --> 47:41.190
Yeah, it's kind of a long day,
and it's getting late.

47:41.226 --> 47:43.092
Um…

47:43.127 --> 47:47.296
We usually have a little party
after we decorate the tree.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.532
Yeah.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.335
I'd love for you to stay.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.203
Besides, it'll be fun.

47:57.442 --> 47:58.441
Okay.

47:58.476 --> 47:59.308
Okay.

48:00.612 --> 48:01.577
Okay.

48:01.613 --> 48:06.082
Thank you.

48:06.084 --> 48:07.183
Hey!

48:07.218 --> 48:08.317
Did you find it?

48:08.353 --> 48:10.887
No, but it has to be somewhere.

48:10.955 --> 48:12.989
Oh, we'll find it sweetheart.

48:13.024 --> 48:14.357
Okay.

48:14.425 --> 48:16.259
Oh, Simon, come and see.

48:16.294 --> 48:19.896
Uh, this is a picture of Sam
when she was 14,

48:19.931 --> 48:23.032
and she and Annie decided
to dress up as elves

48:23.067 --> 48:25.234
and hand out gifts.

48:25.303 --> 48:26.535
That hair is definitely better.

48:27.805 --> 48:29.138
<i>Those elf costumes!</i>

48:29.173 --> 48:30.072
<i>They were cute.</i>

48:30.108 --> 48:30.773
<i>They were cute.</i>

48:30.808 --> 48:31.574
<i>Thank you.</i>

48:34.078 --> 48:34.911
That's… that's somethin',
all right.

48:34.946 --> 48:36.879
Yeah, it is.

48:36.915 --> 48:38.481
Aw.

48:38.516 --> 48:39.849
This is my favourite.

48:39.884 --> 48:40.850
Yeah.

48:40.885 --> 48:41.684
Oh.

49:25.063 --> 49:26.662
Morning.

49:26.698 --> 49:28.097
Oh, um…

49:31.169 --> 49:32.168
Good morning.

49:32.203 --> 49:33.369
Busy as ever?

49:33.438 --> 49:35.671
Ah, just a couple of
last minute things

49:35.740 --> 49:38.541
before my assistant closes up
the office for the holidays.

49:38.576 --> 49:39.909
Yeah. Funny how we
used to talk about

49:39.944 --> 49:43.045
how busy we both were when
the girls were growing up,

49:43.081 --> 49:44.380
running here and there.

49:44.415 --> 49:47.016
How we couldn't wait for things
to slow down

49:47.051 --> 49:49.885
so we could have a little time
to ourselves?

49:49.921 --> 49:52.054
Yeah.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.423
Guess that didn't play out quite
the way we expected.

49:55.126 --> 49:58.794
No. It did not.

49:58.830 --> 50:01.530
Well I, uh, better get changed.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.566
Remember we're going down
to the diner for breakfast

50:03.601 --> 50:05.468
and the Santa photo
this morning?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.470
Yeah. Ready when you are.

50:09.941 --> 50:13.476
Remember the first time we went
for that photo together?

50:13.511 --> 50:18.581
Your mom was so kind to me.

50:18.616 --> 50:21.717
So welcoming.

50:21.753 --> 50:25.154
She loved you like you were
her own daughter.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.689
I know she did.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.224
But, um.

50:28.292 --> 50:30.526
Thank you.

50:30.595 --> 50:32.561
Yeah.

50:32.597 --> 50:34.096
See you soon.

50:34.132 --> 50:35.564
Yeah.

50:43.941 --> 50:47.810

50:56.421 --> 50:59.255
Hey, Murphy family,
I believe you're next.

50:59.290 --> 50:59.922
Great!

50:59.957 --> 51:00.790
Oh, perfect.

51:00.825 --> 51:02.925
Another Murphy family tradition.

51:03.895 --> 51:04.693
Hey, look who's here.

51:04.729 --> 51:05.561
Simon!

51:05.596 --> 51:06.629
Hey.

51:06.697 --> 51:07.663
I thought you got stuck
in a meeting.

51:07.698 --> 51:08.664
Uh, I did.

51:08.699 --> 51:10.566
But I, uh, finished it early.

51:10.635 --> 51:13.202
Didn't want to miss seeing you
take your family Santa photo.

51:13.271 --> 51:14.103
Aww!

51:14.138 --> 51:15.171
Well, the important thing is,

51:15.239 --> 51:17.273
you made it here
for the picture.

51:17.308 --> 51:18.908
Excuse me.

51:20.745 --> 51:22.211
We're next, Santa.

51:22.246 --> 51:23.446
All right.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.181
Simon, come on.

51:25.216 --> 51:26.315
Everybody, squeeze in.

51:26.350 --> 51:27.483
Let's make some room for Simon.

51:27.518 --> 51:28.484
Oh…

51:28.519 --> 51:29.452
Uh, I think it's best
if I just…

51:29.487 --> 51:30.619
Oh, no, no, no.

51:30.655 --> 51:32.822
You get in here beside
your bride-to-be.

51:33.658 --> 51:34.323
Bill, I…

51:34.392 --> 51:35.758
This is a family photo

51:35.793 --> 51:37.293
and you're going to be a part of
this family very soon.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.360
Let's go.

51:40.898 --> 51:45.267
You heard my dad.
Come on.

51:45.303 --> 51:48.137
Okay. 'Tis the season.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.012
Okay.

51:57.048 --> 51:59.548
<i>On three, "Merry Christmas."</i>

51:59.617 --> 52:01.951
One, two, three…

52:01.986 --> 52:04.487
Merry Christmas!

52:17.602 --> 52:18.734
Hey, kiddo.

52:18.769 --> 52:19.735
Hey.

52:22.340 --> 52:25.741
Did you enjoy your walk?

52:25.810 --> 52:27.843
Just wanted to clear my head
so I could try and get

52:27.879 --> 52:31.413
some writing done.

52:31.449 --> 52:33.149
A lot going on right now.

52:36.554 --> 52:37.753
No kidding.

52:42.727 --> 52:44.627
You want some company?

52:44.662 --> 52:46.629
You bet.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.597
Ah, it's cold.

52:53.204 --> 52:55.371
You okay?

52:55.406 --> 52:56.872
I was just walking around

52:56.941 --> 52:59.341
and looking at all the Christmas
decorations and the lights,

52:59.410 --> 53:03.045
and thinking about how much

53:03.080 --> 53:07.816
I love Christmas here,
in this town,

53:07.852 --> 53:10.119
in this house.

53:10.154 --> 53:14.190
Yeah, it's always been
a pretty special place.

53:15.426 --> 53:17.927
You'd think it'd inspire me
to write something.

53:19.864 --> 53:20.829
Aw, sweetie.

53:20.865 --> 53:23.299
You just have to be patient.

53:23.334 --> 53:24.700
Ugh.

53:24.735 --> 53:27.803
You never know when the
inspiration is gonna hit you.

53:32.577 --> 53:34.376
We're almost done with the list.

53:34.412 --> 53:35.878
Yeah.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.846
You know what, it's been fun,

53:37.882 --> 53:40.683
checking all the items off
the list like we used to.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.420
Christmas is almost here.

53:44.455 --> 53:46.255
Almost.

53:55.166 --> 54:01.103
I am really going to miss
this house, dad.

54:01.138 --> 54:07.042
Well, we will always have
our memories to treasure.

54:07.078 --> 54:09.812
And her Christmas stories.

54:09.847 --> 54:11.914
They were so great.

54:11.949 --> 54:14.149
Yep.

54:14.218 --> 54:18.220
I would not be a writer
if it weren't for her.

54:18.256 --> 54:21.790
I just… I wish I could find
a way

54:21.826 --> 54:26.595
to keep her and her stories
alive forever.

54:26.631 --> 54:30.799
What's stopping you?

54:30.868 --> 54:34.436
She's always going
to be with you.

54:34.505 --> 54:37.306
With all of us.

54:37.341 --> 54:39.008
And you're always going
to have her stories.

54:39.043 --> 54:41.343
They're not going away.

54:42.880 --> 54:47.783
And hey, aren't you writers
all supposed to have a muse?

54:47.818 --> 54:48.584
Hmm!

54:48.619 --> 54:49.184
Hmmm.

54:49.220 --> 54:49.852
Hmmm.

54:49.887 --> 54:50.719
Hmm.

54:50.755 --> 54:51.754
Yes!

54:51.822 --> 54:54.323
Yes we are.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.127
Thanks, dad.

54:58.162 --> 55:00.095
Oh, don't thank me, kiddo.

55:00.131 --> 55:03.532
It's my job.

55:06.704 --> 55:08.304
Oh, I love you.

55:08.339 --> 55:10.706
I love you, sweetie.

55:31.362 --> 55:32.361
Morning!

55:33.764 --> 55:36.231
Hey, good morning.

55:36.267 --> 55:37.066
Where are you off to?

55:37.101 --> 55:38.067
It's barely light out.

55:38.102 --> 55:40.102
We're shooting my story today.

55:40.137 --> 55:40.869
Oh!

55:40.905 --> 55:42.571
Yeah.

55:42.606 --> 55:44.306
You know, I don't even know
what your story's about.

55:44.342 --> 55:45.908
Well, you should come see
for yourself.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.509
It's about a couple
from around here.

55:47.545 --> 55:48.344
Really?

55:48.379 --> 55:49.244
Yeah.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.312
I'd love to.

55:50.348 --> 55:51.747
Great.

55:51.782 --> 55:52.748
Oh, um.

55:52.783 --> 55:54.583
Give me five minutes.

55:55.419 --> 55:56.919
Okay.

55:56.954 --> 55:58.020
I mean, you can wear that.

55:58.055 --> 55:58.854
Five minutes!

55:58.889 --> 56:00.155
All right.

56:20.978 --> 56:22.778
Let's do this.

56:27.351 --> 56:29.785
Oh, my dear, it's
Samantha Murphy!

56:31.822 --> 56:33.655
- Irene!
- It's been years!

56:33.691 --> 56:35.224
Yes, it has!

56:35.259 --> 56:36.558
Oh, Sam, this is Charlie.

56:36.594 --> 56:37.192
Hi!

56:37.228 --> 56:37.893
Hi.

56:37.928 --> 56:38.427
Pleasure to meet you.

56:38.462 --> 56:39.094
Sam!

56:39.130 --> 56:40.429
Nice to meet you.

56:40.498 --> 56:42.531
And I still think you have your
grandmother's eyes.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.999
Aw, thank you.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.267
I've been told that before.

56:46.771 --> 56:48.804
I have to say, Samantha, you
could have knocked me over

56:48.839 --> 56:51.273
with a feather when Charlie
told me a TV station

56:51.308 --> 56:54.209
from New York City
wanted to do a story on us?

56:54.245 --> 56:56.211
And getting interviewed
by your fiancé?

56:56.247 --> 56:58.781
She said "why on earth would
anybody want to interview us"

56:58.816 --> 57:00.115
when, you know,

57:00.151 --> 57:01.750
it's not like we're famous
or anybody important.

57:02.953 --> 57:05.087
Well, I think your story
is very important,

57:05.122 --> 57:05.921
so let's tell it.

57:05.956 --> 57:06.588
Are you ready?

57:06.624 --> 57:07.289
Ready.

57:07.358 --> 57:08.023
Okay.

57:08.058 --> 57:09.558
Let's do it.

57:09.593 --> 57:12.661
And what else I find fascinating
is that your anniversary

57:12.696 --> 57:13.962
is on Christmas day.

57:13.998 --> 57:15.631
Yes, it is.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.466
Now how long have you two
been married?

57:17.501 --> 57:19.268
One fabulous year.

57:19.303 --> 57:20.569
One year.

57:20.604 --> 57:23.172
Though, we did fall in love
almost 40 years ago,

57:23.207 --> 57:25.240
when we met at the top of
the Empire State Building

57:25.309 --> 57:26.742
while taking photos.

57:26.811 --> 57:29.144
We just never had the good
sense to do anything about it.

57:29.180 --> 57:30.612
<i>Well, it was one thing
or another.</i>

57:30.648 --> 57:32.981
<i>We kept telling ourselves
it wasn't the right time,</i>

57:33.050 --> 57:36.018
or we weren't ready, or maybe
we should wait a while longer.

57:36.053 --> 57:37.619
Until finally, one day
we woke up,

57:37.688 --> 57:39.388
it was like we'd lost track
of each other.

57:39.423 --> 57:42.157
Before we knew it, I got
a job offer overseas,

57:42.193 --> 57:45.160
and, uh, Irene wanted to move
back home to Cedar Ridge.

57:45.196 --> 57:46.995
So, off I went.

57:47.064 --> 57:48.497
And I came back here.

57:48.566 --> 57:50.365
We lost touch.

57:56.207 --> 57:59.341
And it took you almost 40 years
to find each other again?

57:59.376 --> 58:00.576
Mm-hmm.

58:00.611 --> 58:02.110
You know, we do regret
all the time we lost.

58:02.146 --> 58:05.347
But, uh, we got married
right away and,

58:05.382 --> 58:06.682
uh, bought this lovely home.

58:06.717 --> 58:08.650
And we couldn't be happier.

58:11.522 --> 58:13.255
Well, I'm happy
for the both of you.

58:13.290 --> 58:16.058
Thanks, that was…
that was really wonderful.

58:17.995 --> 58:18.961
Thank you.

58:19.029 --> 58:19.761
That was really,
really wonderful.

58:19.797 --> 58:20.362
Thanks a lot.

58:20.397 --> 58:21.730
All right.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.901
So.

58:25.970 --> 58:27.669
What'd you think?

58:27.705 --> 58:29.738
I thought it was great.

58:29.773 --> 58:31.573
I'm really proud of you.

58:31.609 --> 58:33.275
Thank you.

58:33.310 --> 58:35.277
Um, I gotta wrap a couple
things up,

58:35.346 --> 58:37.980
so it might be a minute.

58:38.015 --> 58:40.182
Okay, well, I think I'm gonna
walk home.

58:40.217 --> 58:42.484
I just wanna get some work done
on the book.

58:42.520 --> 58:43.785
You sure you don't want me
to give you a ride?

58:43.821 --> 58:45.053
No, I'm fine.

58:45.089 --> 58:48.290
I could, um, use the fresh air.

58:48.359 --> 58:50.058
Okay.

58:50.094 --> 58:53.128
Um… I'll see you back
at the house.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.162
Okay.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.839
It was a great piece.

59:14.084 --> 59:18.387
<i>♪ O come, all ye faithful ♪</i>

59:18.422 --> 59:20.522
<i>♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪</i>

59:20.558 --> 59:22.524
Bill, have you seen Annie?

59:24.995 --> 59:27.262
Bill. Didn't you hear me?

59:27.298 --> 59:28.163
Oh, sorry.

59:28.232 --> 59:29.731
I said I was looking for Annie.

59:29.767 --> 59:32.734
Yeah. She went into town to
pick something up for dinner.

59:32.770 --> 59:33.569
Ah.

59:36.807 --> 59:41.143
Is everything all right?

59:41.178 --> 59:43.812
Just got an email
from the realtor.

59:43.881 --> 59:47.783
Looks like we're good to go.

59:47.851 --> 59:50.218
So, that's it, then?

59:53.357 --> 59:55.157
I guess so.

59:57.595 --> 01:00:01.229
Do you ever, uh, think back,
Claire, and…

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.999
ask yourself what happened
between us?

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:04.967
Oh, Bill…

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:06.335
I… I… I know.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:09.171
Six years, I'm dragging some
old baggage out here.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:11.907
But, I do.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:15.544
I… I think about it sometimes,
and for the life of me,

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:19.481
I cannot remember what happened.

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:22.284
I mean, what really happened.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.027
We just drifted apart.

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:36.365
The girls moved out, you kept
busy with the force,

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.235
I wanted to advance
my law career.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:45.273
It just… happened.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:51.013
It's no one's fault.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:54.916
Not much of a reason, is it?

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:58.954
Not after building a life together
for all those years like we did.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.555
No.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:02.391
It's not.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.793
We were happy, though.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.963
For a long time,
weren't we, Claire?

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:12.067
Yes, Bill, we were very happy.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:15.370
Spending Christmas here,
together, in this house?

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:18.807
I think that had a lot to do
with it.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:21.677
I think your mother knew that.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.745
Hmm.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:27.582
Yeah, I think she did.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:42.998
♫

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:44.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:44.635 --> 01:01:45.734
You finished up late.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:47.869
I had to jump right
in to the edit,

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.138
and it took forever.

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.374
Oh, Irene wanted you to have
some scones.

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:53.942
Ohhh…

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:54.776
That's so nice.

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:55.577
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:56.778
I'm actually starving.

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:59.414
Making any progress?

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.349
No.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.418
Maybe you just need some rest.

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:07.055
It's like I can feel the words,
you know?

01:02:07.124 --> 01:02:08.757
I can feel them on the tip
of my tongue,

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:12.561
but I just… I can't
get them out.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:14.863
Well, it's after midnight.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.364
You know what that means?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.999
I do not know what that means.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.635
It is officially
Christmas Eve day.

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.271
And in my family, we have
a very old tradition.

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:25.140
Mm!

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:26.942
You each get a present.

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:28.443
Stay right there.

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:34.816
Hmmm…

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.284
Madam!

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.589
I promise you it is not
a sweater.

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.433
Oh!

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:55.137
I know that nothing can
replace this house

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:57.572
and all the Christmas memories
that it holds,

01:02:57.608 --> 01:03:01.643
but maybe there's just
enough Christmas spirit

01:03:01.678 --> 01:03:03.178
in that little house
to help you find

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:05.213
the story you want to write.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.315
Wow.

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:08.650
Thank you.

01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:10.986
You're welcome.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:12.420
I love it.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:21.329
Wait here.

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:22.330
Where are you going?

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:24.299
Don't worry about it.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.873
Now, it's your turn.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:33.141
My turn?

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.343
Didn't you say you each
get a present?

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.511
I did, I did.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.279
Yeah.

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:39.881
I promise it's not a sweater.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:51.993
It's the night that we met.

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:54.429
Yeah.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:58.400
We had that couple
from Ohio take the picture.

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:00.001
Yeah.

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:02.637
We were both stuck
in the city for work.

01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:05.006
I walked down to Rockefeller
Centre,

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:07.876
and there you were,
sitting on a bench,

01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:11.112
hot apple cider in hand,
staring up at that tree.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.682
And you sat down next to me.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.217
And do you remember
what you said?

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:21.056
Yeah, I do. How could I forget?

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:21.890
"Come here often?"

01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:24.759
So bad!

01:04:24.795 --> 01:04:25.861
So bad.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:31.132
And I said "about once a year."

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:37.472
We stayed there for hours,
just talking and laughing.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:41.509
I knew that night that one day,
I would marry you.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:54.890
Uh… I'll let you get
back to work.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:56.358
Okay.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.792
Good night.

01:04:57.828 --> 01:04:59.160
Night.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:20.115
♫

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:26.721
♫

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:42.871
You never did get
the hang of that.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:48.810
All thumbs.

01:05:48.879 --> 01:05:55.817
It is up, and then through.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:07.062
There.

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:13.668
What?

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:20.575
You… look beautiful.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.644
Thank you.

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:29.918
Uh, I decided that I'm not going
to sell.

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:31.386
Really?

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.955
Yeah.

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:37.592
I love this house too much
to let it go.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:40.462
Yeah, maybe it's starting
to show its age a little,

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.432
and it's got some work to do,
but I'm retired, so…

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.001
I got plenty of time.

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:50.005
I think the girls would really
like it if I held onto it, so…

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.673
And who knows, maybe we could,

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:54.843
you know, have some more
Christmases here together,

01:06:54.878 --> 01:06:57.145
or come…

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.114
I love this house too.

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.215
Yeah?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.617
Mm-hmm.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:09.557
Oh, well, maybe you want to, uh,
I don't know, think about,

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:18.066
uh, coming back for a…
a visit sometime soon?

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:20.001
I might.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.339
Um.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.807
You know, I forgot my purse.

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:28.076
I'm going to go get that.

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:29.010
Gotta get that.

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:30.278
Oh, of course.

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:31.546
Yeah.

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:32.881
Okay.

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:42.724
<i>Definitely have eaten
my fill of gingerbread cookies.</i>

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:49.864
<i>Samantha and I are having
a great time.</i>

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.666
Yeah, I miss you too, dad.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:52.567
<i>Okay.</i>

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:53.802
<i>Yeah, will do.</i>

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:54.536
All right.

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:55.937
Merry Christmas.

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:56.771
Hi.

01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:58.106
Bye-bye.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:07:59.808
Hey.

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:00.875
All set?

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.110
Yeah, I think so.

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.212
I was just talking to my folks.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.814
They say hi.

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:11.753
You look nice.

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:16.624
I was, um, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:17.859
<i>Come on, everybody.</i>

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:20.462
<i>The Christmas train is leaving
the station.</i>

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:24.265
Train's leaving the station.

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:25.834

Hello, everyone, and welcome.

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:19.787
Thank you for coming out
and celebrating

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.589
our annual Christmas dance!

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.529
As you all know, this is also
our annual fundraiser

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:29.930
for our library.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:33.201
Your generosity helps to provide
the books and programs

01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:34.536
that open our children

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:37.205
to a world of reading
and learning all year long.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.339
Thank you again.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:40.041
And, Merry Christmas!

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.844
Enough talk, let's dance!

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:52.819
Well, I would like to propose
a toast.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.823
To all of us.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:58.826
We have come together once again
as a family to celebrate

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:00.929
the joys of the season.

01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:04.399
And to the wonderful woman
who brought us together.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:06.668
And, best of all,
the joy of Christmas,

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:10.038
which we all hold so close
in our hearts.

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:11.706
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.074
Merry Christmas.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.713
Oh!

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:19.847
Nana's favourite song.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:20.815
Yup.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:21.583
She's right.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:22.951
Wow.

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:23.818
Well, if that is not a sign,
I don't know what is.

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:25.954
Come on, handsome.

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:28.456
We're gonna dance.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.726
What do you say?

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.695
One dance for old times' sake?

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.096
If you play your cards right,
mister,

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:37.232
we just might make it two.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.199
Hmm.

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:41.769
You two coming?

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:43.504
Could be a little practice
for your first dance

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.106
at your wedding.

01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:46.274
Hmm?

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:47.108
Uh…

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:48.243
Shall we?

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:49.244
We shall.

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:56.651

In case you haven't noticed,

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:06.227
my parents can be
quite persistent.

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:09.163
That's okay.

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:10.465
Look at them.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:16.371
They look happy.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:19.474
Well, there's a lot of that
going around.

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:23.811
You've had a lot on your mind.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.513
I know.

01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:29.784
We love each other.

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:33.688
I know that you've been hurt
in the past.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:40.595
And maybe it's time to get over
that fear here with me.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.465
I will always be here for you.

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:46.367
<i>Samantha.</i>

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.669
<i>I forgot to tell you.</i>

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.804
I told your dad the idea
of a Christmas wedding,

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:51.039
and he agrees.

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:52.473
What about a Christmas wedding?

01:11:52.509 --> 01:11:54.475
<i>For Samantha and Simon,
of course.</i>

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:57.745
A year-long engagement, that's
just the right amount of time.

01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:00.181
Mom, we have tons of time
to talk about that much later.

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:01.482
No, I think your folks
are right.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.051
I mean, a lot of couples
order flowers

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.819
at least a year in advance.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:05.687
Mark?

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:06.654
Uh-nuh.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.822
Have you guys thought

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:08.923
about where you might
wanna get married?

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.958
No, dad, we haven't.

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:12.760
Simon, you are awfully quiet.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:13.761
What about you?

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.363
Where do you want
to get married?

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:18.466
Um… You know, we haven't,

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.834
uh, we haven't really
talked about it yet.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:20.868
We haven't had time.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:21.836
Well, you know what they say.

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:24.005
No time like the present.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:35.049
I can't do this anymore, Sam.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:35.750
Okay, no.

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:36.651
I know. I know.

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:37.352
I'm going to go tell themrino

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:40.121
No.

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:42.023
It's not about that.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:44.258
You're not ready for this.

01:12:44.294 --> 01:12:48.429
And I, uh, I don't know what
to do to change that for you.

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:50.832
You've got to write the ending
to this story yourself.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.835
And in the meantime, I
think it's best if I just go.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:54.635
Simon…

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.838
I'm sorry, Sam.
I'm sorry.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:13:00.641
We can just talk when we're both
back in the city, okay?

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.377
Merry Christmas.

01:13:11.321 --> 01:13:13.287
Samantha?

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:16.057
Is everything okay?

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.925
There is no engagement, mom.

01:13:17.961 --> 01:13:19.560
There… there's no wedding.

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:21.829
We've been pretending
this whole time.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:24.499
And, I'm so sorry.

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:26.000
Why didn't you just say
something?

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.970
We didn't want
to ruin Christmas.

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:32.006
Honey.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:36.210
He asked, I said yes,
and I panicked.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.478
I couldn't stop thinking about

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:38.813
Paul breaking off
the engagement,

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.181
and what that did to me.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:45.286
And I… I couldn't stop
thinking about you and dad.

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:48.923
When we were growing up,
you were the happiest.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:50.625
You were the perfect couple.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.295
And even with all of that,
you just…

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:57.498
You couldn't make it work.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:01.169
Oh, sweetheart.

01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:03.704
Your father and I got a divorce
but that does not mean

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.375
that we regret a moment
that we spent together.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:09.977
We have so many
wonderful memories.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:13.815
We have two beautiful daughters.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:16.851
Those were the happiest days
of our lives.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:19.053
I don't know what the future
holds for us,

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:24.025
or even if we have a future,
but just imagine

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:27.428
what we would have missed out
on if we didn't even try.

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:30.832
Sweetheart.

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:34.035
Sometimes you just gotta
take a leap of faith.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:38.506
If you love him the rest
will work itself out.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.377
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:45.179
Thank you, mom.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:49.016
Simon loves you very much.

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.017
Hmm?

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:51.486
I know.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:52.520
Annie, Mark.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:54.956
I need your keys.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.791
Well, wait, what's going on?

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.125
Where… where's Simon?

01:14:58.194 --> 01:15:01.028
It's a really long story, but…
I made a mistake,

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:02.396
and I have to fix it.

01:15:02.465 --> 01:15:04.232
Go get him, Sam.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.586
It's me.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:27.788
I know I'm the last person
you want to talk to right now,

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.191
but I'm on my way to the house.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.126
Please, wait for me!

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:37.598
Come on.

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:38.232
Come on, come on,
come on, come on…

01:15:48.478 --> 01:15:50.478
Simon?

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:54.048
Simon!

01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.854
Simon!

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:36.190
Got your message.

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:41.729
You came back.

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:43.364
Of course I came back.

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.336
Look.

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:54.475
I know that there are going to
be moments when we disagree.

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:57.778
I know there are going to be
times that are tough.

01:16:57.814 --> 01:17:00.414
I know the road isn't always
going to be perfect,

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:04.952
but I know that I love you.

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:10.858
And there is no one that I would
rather be married to than you.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.761
I want to make sure
that you're not just…

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:17.264
caught up in the emotion
of being at this house

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:20.368
with your family on Christmas.

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.203
Are you ready to get married…

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.139
to me?

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.714
Would you ask me again?

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:41.055
I mean, unless… unless
you've changed your mind.

01:17:43.593 --> 01:17:46.427
Samantha, I love you.

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:47.928
I want to spend every Christmas

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:51.666
for the rest of my life
with you.

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:54.802
Will you marry me?

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.338
Yes.

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.639
Yes!

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:26.834
<i>Come on, Sam.</i>

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:28.436
<i>We're opening presents!</i>

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.538
Be right there!

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.256
Thank you.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.509
And this one is for you, Sam.

01:19:08.544 --> 01:19:09.944
Thank you, dad.

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.946
Oh, it's not from me.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:12.947
<i>Oh.</i>

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.250
It's from Nana.

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:18.252
There's one for each
of you girls.

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:22.823
Bringing us all back
together again.

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:24.759
That was her real gift.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.029
You go first, mom.

01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:30.064
Okay.

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:36.604
Oh!

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.640
What did you get, mom?

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:41.842
I love it.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:44.211
It's our last Christmas.

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:45.012
Oh!

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:47.982
I love it! It's beautiful!

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:52.386
Okay, my turn.

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:57.558
Just like when we were kids.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:03.697
It's her old recipe book.

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:05.399
That's great.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.301
<i>Ooh, wow.</i>

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:08.903
Wait, and she marked it…

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:10.237
Oh!

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:11.472
<i>Gingerbread men!</i>

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:13.541
It's her gingerbread recipe!

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:15.743
I want that recipe.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:18.312
Yes, of course.

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:20.047
Oh my gosh.

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:22.249
Okay, dad.

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:24.285
What did you get?
Open yours.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.486
Okay.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:34.395
She must have known that
I would never have the heart

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:35.362
to sell this place.

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:36.697
<i>Aww.</i>

01:20:36.766 --> 01:20:38.499
Yeah.

01:20:38.568 --> 01:20:39.567
Aww.

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:45.239
Well, what did you get Sam?

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:46.740
Let's see.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:47.808
Yeah.

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:08.262
Oh!

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:14.835
It's the Christmas Star.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:15.536
There it is.

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:16.971
Of course

01:21:18.608 --> 01:21:19.607
It's perfect!

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:22.843
Oh, it's a card.

01:21:22.912 --> 01:21:24.278
Let's see.

01:21:28.017 --> 01:21:32.653
"Traditions are the stories
that families write together.

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:35.589
"Keep writing our story."

01:21:42.899 --> 01:21:47.201
I think there's one tradition
left to do, of course.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:49.103
Yes.

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:50.104
Can you help me?

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:51.138
Yes.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.820
Thank you, Nana.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:08.856
For everything.

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.330
And the list is complete.

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:17.631
Yep.

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:19.934
The list is complete.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:21.302
So, what do you say, folks?

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:22.636
Same time next year?

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:24.204
I will bring the gingerbread.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.340
I wouldn't miss it.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:27.541
I'm in.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:36.317
How would you guys feel
about a Christmas wedding?

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:37.251
Oh!

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.018
Yes!

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:38.786
Really?

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:39.753
<i>What?</i>

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:40.587
Yes!

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:41.655
Of course!

01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:46.593
Merry Christmas.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:49.430
Merry Christmas.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:50.931
Merry Christmas my loves.

01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:51.799
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:52.800
Merry Christmas.

01:22:52.868 --> 01:22:54.001
Merry Christmas.

01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:55.336
Merry Christmas.

01:22:55.371 --> 01:22:56.270
Merry Christmas.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.238
Merry Christmas.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.373
Merry Christmas.

01:22:59.442 --> 01:23:00.841
Merry Christmas.
