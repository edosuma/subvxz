00:01.135 --> 00:02.167
<i>Previously on</i> Reign...

00:02.169 --> 00:03.635
Does the archduke know about us?

00:03.637 --> 00:05.237
ELIZABETH:
<i> I told the archduke I would</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:06.505
never give you up.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.040
(sniffs)

00:08.042 --> 00:08.774
(panting)

00:08.776 --> 00:10.275
(grunts)
Gideon!

00:10.277 --> 00:11.510
(sobbing)

00:11.512 --> 00:13.512
<i> He was poisoned, Jane.</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:14.646
Your Majesty,

00:14.648 --> 00:16.248
we have to go.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.650
I will find who did this to you.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.252
I stand before
you to announce

00:20.254 --> 00:22.254
that I am blessed and honored
to carry within me

00:22.256 --> 00:23.655
an heir
with a claim

00:23.657 --> 00:26.392
to both the Scottish
and English thrones.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.193
Please tell me
that you didn't burn those men.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.662
She convinced me that it was
the only way to protect myself.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.664
Who convinced you?
Keira.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.133
LADY LENNOX:
<i> Keira is dead.</i>

00:34.135 --> 00:36.068
You know that this is dangerous.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.670
I'm sorry, Mother. I forgot
you're a believer in the occult.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.273
As soon as Charles chooses
one of the brides approved

00:41.275 --> 00:45.411
<i> by Philip, Spain</i>

00:45.413 --> 00:46.745
CHARLES:
The love of my life

00:46.747 --> 00:49.081
and the new queen of France.
Come, Nicole!

00:49.083 --> 00:50.549
HENRI:<i> You're with</i>
<i> the wrong man. You deserve</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:51.817
someone that cares for you.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.352
<i> Spain wants me in power.</i>

00:53.354 --> 00:54.586
By marrying Nicole,
you risk

00:54.588 --> 00:57.289
losing the backing of Spain
and your throne

00:57.291 --> 00:59.291
along with it.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.393
♪ ♪

01:04.198 --> 01:07.232

01:16.744 --> 01:18.561
Leeza,

01:18.562 --> 01:20.379
my child, oh,
it's been so long.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.580
Spare me the pleasantries,
Mother.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.282
I'm not here to see you.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.718
I want to talk to Charles
and his Protestant fiancée.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.487
Her name is Nicole.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.522
Your Majesty.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.392
Charles, do you truly intend

01:33.394 --> 01:35.260
to go through
with this marriage against

01:35.262 --> 01:36.295
Spain's wishes?

01:36.297 --> 01:37.362
I'm sorry, Leeza,

01:37.364 --> 01:38.831
but I must
follow my heart.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.299
You cannot be swayed?

01:40.301 --> 01:41.200
I cannot.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.868
Well, then...

01:42.870 --> 01:45.637
I suppose
there's nothing to be done.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.274
Except stay
for the king's wedding.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.743
You can't be serious, Leeza.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.413
I was almost sent to a nunnery
for following my heart!

01:54.415 --> 01:57.116
Water under the bridge.
Better yet, champagne.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.786
Oh, and I brought a gift, too,
as a token of goodwill.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.888
On the way here,
my soldiers rounded up

02:02.890 --> 02:04.823
all these French heretics.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.893
Oh, the one with
the nasty gleam in her eye

02:07.895 --> 02:09.294
is a notorious witch.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.829
I thought the trials could

02:10.831 --> 02:12.397
bring us
all together.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.833
That is so thoughtful of you.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.504
Whatever it is
that you're up to,

02:18.506 --> 02:20.139
can we please
just get it over with?

02:20.141 --> 02:21.573
Why would I be up
to something?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.775
After reflection and prayer,

02:23.777 --> 02:26.645
I realized France
isn't worth my efforts.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.680
I'll take my holiday
here and then...

02:28.682 --> 02:31.483
leave you to your own mess.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.688
You've been avoiding me.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.557
I've been busy.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.693
Charles is taking me on a
tour of France in a few days

02:41.695 --> 02:43.529
to celebrate our engagement.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.831
Are you going by choice
or by order of the king?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.267
What's the difference?

02:48.269 --> 02:51.270
And don't pretend to be
heartbroken about it.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.672
We both know you only
pursued me to sabotage Charles

02:53.674 --> 02:54.940
and take his throne.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.309
However our affair began,

02:57.311 --> 02:59.678
it bloomed into something
very, very real.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.713
I can hardly eat
or sleep.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.950
Even my favorite earrings fail
to cheer me.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.953
Nicole, you understand me
as no woman ever has.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.222
And I understand you.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.191
Admit it,
you don't love Charles--

03:12.193 --> 03:14.459
you love me.
It doesn't matter.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.395
He can make me queen of France.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.498
Which means I cannot love you,
Henri.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.334
Well, it seems
we're agreed then.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.204
We shouldn't love each other,
and yet we do.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.674
(sighs)

03:28.676 --> 03:30.676
GREER:
<i> You look...</i>

03:30.678 --> 03:33.378
huge!
(chuckles)

03:33.380 --> 03:34.947
Thank you, Greer.

03:34.949 --> 03:37.349
I've secretly decided
I'm not leaving this chair

03:37.351 --> 03:38.750
until I give birth.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.754
I have some news
that might interest you.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.556
I've called James
back to court.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.660
You've lifted
your brother's banishment?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.395
I haven't heard back
from him yet,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.531
but I've told him
how urgent my situation here is.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.733
I'm still operating
without a full privy council.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.535
You want James
to fill one of the seats?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.737
No. I want to name him regent.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.007
Just in case something happens
to me during childbirth,

04:02.009 --> 04:04.776
I want someone trustworthy
to step in to lead.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.612
You're going to be fine, Mary.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.347
And James will come
as soon as he can.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.983
He's loyal to you.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.384
What is it?

04:13.621 --> 04:14.987
Something
I probably shouldn't tell you.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.855
I know
you're trying,

04:16.857 --> 04:18.790
against all odds, to keep
the peace with Darnley...

04:18.792 --> 04:20.692
What has he done now?

04:24.398 --> 04:26.531
Mary.

04:26.533 --> 04:30.369
Oh, um, um,
I have something. Look at it.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.537
Look what I have made
for the little one.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.474
It's nice,
isn't it? Oh, uh,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.342
please, have a seat.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.543
How are you feeling?

04:38.545 --> 04:40.379
Darnley,
I thought that we agreed

04:40.381 --> 04:41.913
that you wouldn't make
a drunken,

04:41.915 --> 04:43.682
whoring spectacle of yourself
anymore.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.651
And yet Greer
tells me

04:45.653 --> 04:47.352
that you were stumbling
around the halls

04:47.354 --> 04:49.688
last night,
drunk and incoherent.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.424
Last night? Really?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.359
Were you so drunk
you don't remember?
No.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.495
I-I don't remember drinking.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.530
You don't look well.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.300
I'm, um... I'm not, uh...

05:01.302 --> 05:04.836
not feeling quite myself.
(stammers) Itchy shirt.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.438
I don't know what...
This itches.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.906
Your skin.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.041
Hmm?

05:09.043 --> 05:11.510
Darnley, your back!

05:11.512 --> 05:12.844
Wh-What?

05:12.846 --> 05:15.681
Here, look.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.851
They're lesions.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.320
I-I...

05:21.322 --> 05:23.488
I've seen something
like this before.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.990
When I was little,
in the convent,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.425
we used to visit
the sick...

05:28.595 --> 05:30.662
Darnley,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.999
have you taken any lovers
with, um...

05:34.001 --> 05:35.934
with syphilis?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.803
No! I've...

05:37.805 --> 05:40.872
No, that's-that's...
that's not possible. I...

05:40.874 --> 05:43.475
I've seen men with
that. The-the...

05:43.477 --> 05:46.511
the lesions all over
their bodies. The-the madness.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.380
I had a friend who thought
he was the red devil,

05:48.382 --> 05:49.748
and then his teeth fell out.
I can't possibly have that.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.882
Darnley,
listen to me.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.018
You need to see
a doctor immediately.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.354
You need treatment.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.389
What do you care
what happens to me?

05:57.391 --> 06:00.025
You had me thrown in a dungeon.
Darnley, you're

06:00.027 --> 06:02.394
my husband
and the father of my child.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.496
I don't want to see you suffer.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.098
I want to help you.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.533
It...

06:09.903 --> 06:13.105
Please,
let me help you.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.040
I don't know what to do.

06:15.042 --> 06:19.711
I know of a facility where
they have the best treatment.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.847
If you want to be a part
of our child's life,

06:21.849 --> 06:24.850
you need to go there and heal.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.718
Please.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.653
For all of us.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.659
You actually feel sympathy?

06:34.661 --> 06:35.927
For Darnley,

06:35.929 --> 06:37.562
the snake that's
tried to ruin you.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.030
Bothwell, the man is ill.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.633
For all we know, his illness
could have caused his insanity

06:41.635 --> 06:43.435
and cruelty.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.537
Don't waste this moment
making excuses for him.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.973
This may be your last chance to
save yourself and destroy him.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.875
I told you,
I'm not interested in bloodshed.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.443
There's been enough already.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.445
It seems the disease
will kill him for us.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.046
We need only
lock him away.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.915
Then maybe you and I
might still have a chance.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.116
Bothwell,
stop.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.051
Darnley is the king of Scotland

07:00.053 --> 07:02.053
and he is still my husband.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.822
We had our chance
to convict him,

07:03.824 --> 07:05.557
and we failed.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.426
We must accept that.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.428
I have nothing to offer you
as a woman.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.962
I don't believe that.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.465
I am the man fated
to be with you.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.934
It's dangerous
for us to be close.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.437
And it will be especially so
when the baby comes.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.539
My enemies will be
watching me closely.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.741
I cannot afford to give them
any cause to gossip.

07:22.743 --> 07:26.511
You would spend your life
denying your heart?

07:28.015 --> 07:30.081
You are my bodyguard

07:30.083 --> 07:33.952
and my most trusted protector.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.955
But you can't be anything more.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.758
I understand.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.567
What do you mean you
can't give Luc and me the
annulment? You promised!

07:48.569 --> 07:51.570
I promised to try.
A king is not a pope, Claude.
We can't

07:51.572 --> 07:53.004
go on like this, Charles.
You said weeks ago

07:53.006 --> 07:54.239
that this annulment
would happen.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.141
And it will. Someday.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.109
But right now,
my fiancée happens

07:58.111 --> 08:00.145
to be a Protestant.
I-I can't be asking Spain

08:00.147 --> 08:02.113
and the Vatican for favors.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.049
Because you're marrying
who you choose.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.717
I have no choice.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.053
I know it doesn't seem fair,

08:08.055 --> 08:10.255
but have faith.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.262
Claude,

08:17.264 --> 08:18.730
I've been thinking.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.099
You should go to Leith.
What?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.602
I-I can't.
You and I are married.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.070
Until death do us part.

08:25.072 --> 08:28.039
If you stay,
it's your heart that will die.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.075
So will mine.

08:30.077 --> 08:33.144
As much as I've wanted
this marriage to work, it can't.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.747
You love another.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.658
Apparently you have sent my son
to a hospital

08:46.660 --> 08:48.827
to be treated for
a ghastly disease.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.929
What if people hear of this?
For your information,

08:50.931 --> 08:53.999
I have gone to<i> great</i> lengths
to protect your son,

08:54.001 --> 08:55.534
even care for him,

08:55.536 --> 08:57.869
despite his many treacheries
against me.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.739
You should be thanking me
right now. You...

09:00.741 --> 09:03.041
Oh, God.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.309
(groans)
What is it?

09:04.311 --> 09:05.777
The baby.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.146
No, fetch the midwife
at once!

09:08.148 --> 09:10.949
The child is coming.
Hurry!
(Mary pants)

09:16.557 --> 09:18.189
WOMAN:
Look at all these jewels.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.826
And F-French
cheese.

09:21.828 --> 09:24.663
How did you manage
to afford all this?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.831
I didn't, Mother.
They're gifts.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.833
From Queen
Elizabeth.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.836
Lately, we've grown...
quite close.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.238
Why does it all come
from France?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.975
The queen is fond
of French delicacies.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.243
I never knew a servant
of the queen

09:38.245 --> 09:39.945
could do so well
for her family.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.581
Thank you, Father.
Mmm.

09:42.583 --> 09:46.051
Well, I should be off to work.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.220
(birds chirping)

09:49.222 --> 09:51.723
(door opens, shuts)

09:51.725 --> 09:53.625
Your Majesty?

09:54.928 --> 09:59.197
It's been 47 days
since Gideon was killed.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.200
Do you still think it was
your fiancé who poisoned him?

10:02.202 --> 10:07.706
The archduke was the only one
who had motive.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.175
He knew

10:10.176 --> 10:12.643
how much I loved Gideon and that
I would never end the affair.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.879
I have no proof.
But I have turned it

10:14.881 --> 10:18.883
over in my mind again and again.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.753
And the only other person
who knew

10:21.755 --> 10:24.289
how much Gideon meant to me
was you.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.191
You suspect me,

10:26.193 --> 10:29.160
Your Majesty?
Don't be frightened, Jane.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.262
I've already ruled you out.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.932
You had no reason
to harm Gideon,

10:33.934 --> 10:36.901
and you knew what I'd do to
your family if you betrayed me.

10:36.903 --> 10:40.171
The archduke had
no such precedent.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.174
He left me here,

10:43.176 --> 10:45.744
to grieve on my own
while he tends

10:45.746 --> 10:47.412
to business.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.414
(drawer opens)
Look.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.917
It's a manifest.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.686
The archduke has

10:54.688 --> 10:57.689
a Portuguese ship
sailing to Austria.

10:57.691 --> 11:02.327
His family's business
depends on the gold it carries.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.729
You're going to sink it?

11:04.731 --> 11:09.234
No, I'm going to steal it.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.404
(Mary screaming)

11:12.406 --> 11:15.273
(panting)

11:15.275 --> 11:17.976
Greer, there's something wrong.
I can feel it.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.911
It's all right, Mary.
Just hold on.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.847
(grunting)

11:22.849 --> 11:24.349
MAN:
Lady Greer.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.653
(panting)
Where are you going?

11:27.654 --> 11:29.054
I'm just going to speak
with the doctor a moment.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.288
Tell me what's happening.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.457
You're losing
too much blood.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.395
What happens to me
doesn't matter.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.398
If it comes down to a choice
between me and the baby,

11:40.400 --> 11:41.766
you choose the baby.

11:41.768 --> 11:42.901
Mary, don't talk like that.

11:42.903 --> 11:43.935
Do you understand?

11:43.937 --> 11:46.438
Yes, Your Majesty.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.107
(grunting)

11:55.282 --> 11:57.916
Greer, bring Bothwell to me.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.884
I don't want to leave you.
Please.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.786
In case I need to say good-bye.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.422
(panting)

12:04.424 --> 12:07.092
(owl hooting)

12:09.329 --> 12:11.496
Little brother.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.964
I've been looking for you.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.499
Did you check
the throne room?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.367
Oh, wait,
I wouldn't be found there,

12:16.369 --> 12:18.169
since I'm not the king.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.071
You enjoy shifting
Spain's favor

12:20.073 --> 12:22.140
back and forth between us,
don't you?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.042
Well, I've had enough.
Relax,

12:24.044 --> 12:24.909
dear brother.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.046
Spain has chosen you.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.180
What?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.381
I didn't come here

12:30.383 --> 12:32.383
to accept Charles's decision.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.820
I came here
to quietly hand you victory.

12:35.822 --> 12:38.423
Now, Charles is aware
there's a Spanish warship

12:38.425 --> 12:40.425
outside the French harbor?

12:40.427 --> 12:44.028
It concerns him. But not enough
to force him off the throne.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.364
Well, when half the Spanish
Armada arrive to join it,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.032
he'll change his mind.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.502
Spain would actually do that
for me?

12:50.504 --> 12:53.304
You've always been far more
qualified to rule than Charles.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.241
Philip and I are confident
that once you're king,

12:56.243 --> 12:57.976
you'll heed Spain's wishes:

12:57.978 --> 13:00.912
keep France Catholic,
marry who you're told,

13:00.914 --> 13:04.015
and so on and so forth.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.486
Of course. Once I'm king.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.355
The ships are due
in a matter of days.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.791
I'll be gone before they arrive.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.493
God willing, Charles will
abdicate in a sensible manner.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.494
But if not,

13:16.496 --> 13:18.997
you may use force.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.502
Once the rest
of the Spanish Armada arrives,

13:24.504 --> 13:26.104
I will take the throne.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.006
Nicole, run away with me.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.507
And defy the king of France?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.142
He won't be king for long.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.210
I need time to think, Henri.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.979
No, we have to leave tonight.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.382
If you go on that engagement
tour, I'll lose you forever.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.818
Won't Spain be upset with you
for this?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.820
They may not
send the ships.
They need me.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.089
Leeza says I'm the only Catholic
ruler Spain can count on.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.125
You will be my queen.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.526
(groans)

13:48.528 --> 13:52.397
(panting)

13:52.399 --> 13:54.532
You swear Charles
won't be hurt?

13:54.534 --> 13:57.268
Once he sees my ships,
he will stand down.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.903
Charles has never wanted
to be king.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.171
Abdicating will be
the best thing

14:00.173 --> 14:01.406
that's ever happened to him.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.174
Just as you are the best thing

14:03.176 --> 14:05.910
that's ever happened to me.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.079
I love you, Nicole.

14:08.081 --> 14:11.416
(sniffles)
Henri...

14:11.418 --> 14:13.451
I'm yours.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.324
Go pack your things, quickly.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.459
Oh, and, Nicole,

14:21.461 --> 14:22.560
bring me the corset.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.028
You know the one I like.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.474
(clattering,
dog barking in distance)

14:39.579 --> 14:42.914
Hello, Jane.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.415
Lord Narcisse.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.151
What are you doing here?

14:47.153 --> 14:48.620
Where is my family?

14:48.622 --> 14:50.288
Oh, I sent them away.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.090
Where?
To France,

14:52.092 --> 14:54.626
where they will stay
under my protection.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.628
You kidnapped my family?

14:56.630 --> 14:58.162
Why?

14:58.164 --> 15:01.032
I have done everything
you asked of me.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.568
I spied on Elizabeth,
I poisoned her lover.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.904
And you've been
generously compensated

15:05.906 --> 15:07.372
for all your hard work.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.376
But someone must take the fall
for Gideon's death.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.312
Elizabeth already
suspects the archduke.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.980
I've made sure of it.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.982
At this moment,
she's planning a naval attack

15:17.984 --> 15:19.918
to cripple his finances.
Yeah, but that

15:19.920 --> 15:21.653
is not enough.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.655
He has to die.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.658
For us to walk away from this
cleanly, Elizabeth needs

15:26.660 --> 15:30.428
to believe that justice
has been served.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.333
You want me to convince her
to order an assassination?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.235
She won't do it.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.103
Killing the archduke
would risk retribution

15:39.105 --> 15:40.405
from Austria, Spain...

15:40.407 --> 15:42.273
That is the endgame.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.675
Elizabeth ensures

15:43.677 --> 15:46.644
her own downfall,

15:46.646 --> 15:50.281
and you retire comfortably
to France.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.617
You ask too much of me.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.620
Jane, we have come so far.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.122
Do not lose confidence now.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.992
Think of your family.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.694
Because if you fail me,

16:02.696 --> 16:06.431
if Elizabeth learns
that I was behind all this,

16:06.433 --> 16:08.967
you will never see them again.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.442
I can't leave hospital.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.044
Mother, I'm sick.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.713
I don't care
what Mary says.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.449
I can get better treatment
for you back at court.

16:24.451 --> 16:28.186
She just wants to imprison you
here, far away from the throne.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.055
Far away from the power that
you should be seizing right now.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.057
I have no power left.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.593
Listen to me,
Mary is in labor.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.062
A very difficult labor.
Do you know what that means?

16:38.064 --> 16:41.065
Oh, my God, I'm
going to have a child.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.101
It's more than that.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.436
Mary may not survive
the delivery.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.074
In a state of emergency,

16:50.076 --> 16:53.244
a privy council can be installed
by a royal signature.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.779
You are still king.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.515
You can assemble a privy council
that supports you.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.784
What does that matter?

16:59.786 --> 17:03.654
I d... I don't have
the Crown Matrimonial.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.592
If Mary dies,
I will no longer be king.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.695
If Mary dies,
the council can name you regent.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.132
Mary is a survivor.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.600
It is worse if she lives.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.802
Mary will do everything she can
to keep your child away

17:17.804 --> 17:20.505
from you. But with the privy
council at your side,

17:20.507 --> 17:22.507
you can fight back.

17:22.509 --> 17:26.344
This is your only chance
for a future.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.347
Mother...

17:29.349 --> 17:32.283
what if Mary's right about me?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.754
I keep seeing Keira.

17:36.756 --> 17:40.358
Well, I...
I know she's dead,

17:40.360 --> 17:42.627
but she appears to me.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.798
Is that not madness?

17:49.302 --> 17:53.271
If seeing Keira makes
you happy, does it matter?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.772
She did love me.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.641
And your child
will love you.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.743
But if you let her,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.812
Mary will take your
heir away from you

18:00.814 --> 18:05.316
just as she has taken
everything else.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.155
Well, since the king of France
has summoned us before dawn,

18:11.157 --> 18:13.691
now would be a good time to
tell me, what have you done?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.260
I have no idea what this
is about, Mother.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.463
I was asleep in my chambers
the same as you.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.364
(footsteps approaching)
CHARLES: You know who isn't
asleep in their chambers?

18:21.468 --> 18:23.301
Nicole.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.436
Neither is Henri.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.171
They're both missing.
Missing?

18:27.173 --> 18:29.140
Castle guards saw Henri ride off

18:29.142 --> 18:30.808
with Nicole in the night,

18:30.810 --> 18:33.544
headed for a Spanish ship
on the harbor.

18:33.546 --> 18:37.181
The same ship you sent
months ago to support Henri.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.749
Did you know about this?

18:38.751 --> 18:40.618
Certainly not.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.553
I don't believe you,
sister.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.455
I don't think Spain
ever had any intention

18:44.457 --> 18:46.591
of accepting my marriage
or my reign.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.726
You and my brother have
been plotting against me,

18:48.728 --> 18:52.296
and Nicole's kidnapping
is proof.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.166
We don't know that
he kidnapped her.
What do you mean?

18:55.168 --> 18:57.602
Are you accusing my fiancée
of betraying me?

18:57.604 --> 18:59.337
Nicole loves me as I love her.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.506
She's the only person
I've ever been able to count on

19:01.508 --> 19:02.840
in the world.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.809
God knows what Henri's
doing to Nicole

19:04.811 --> 19:07.311
against her will
as we speak.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.481
And you, Leeza, will pay.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.452
I am married to the most
powerful man in the world,

19:14.454 --> 19:17.188
and I will not be threatened
by my damaged brother

19:17.190 --> 19:18.789
who is unfit to rule.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.359
I am the king, and I will have
you arrested for treason!

19:21.361 --> 19:22.860
You wouldn't dare.
Charles.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.296
You're understandably upset,

19:25.298 --> 19:26.697
but Leeza isn't
only your sister,

19:26.699 --> 19:29.300
she is the queen of Spain.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.602
She is an enemy of France.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.237
Take my sister
to the dungeon.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.539
Charles, no!

19:34.541 --> 19:36.307
No! Let go of me!

19:36.309 --> 19:38.309
You can't do this!

19:38.311 --> 19:40.578
Throw her in with her heretics!
Tell them to
let me go, Mother!

19:40.580 --> 19:42.346
Mother?!

19:42.348 --> 19:45.449
<i> (Mary groaning in pain)</i>

19:45.451 --> 19:47.185
(groaning)

19:47.187 --> 19:49.220
Can't you do something
for her? Anything?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.788
The queen's condition
is deteriorating.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.224
I fear the possibility

19:53.226 --> 19:55.426
of losing both of them
if I don't operate.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.461
BOTHWELL:
No. If you open her up,

19:57.463 --> 20:00.765
she will die.
Sir, the queen is not
going to survive.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.367
The question now is
whether we save the baby

20:03.369 --> 20:05.636
and relieve Mary of her agony.
Bothwell, where are you?

20:05.638 --> 20:08.406
I'm here. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

20:08.408 --> 20:12.210
Something isn't right.
My baby, he's-he's dying.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.712
Mary, listen to me, I promise
you, your baby is going to live.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.781
You have to save him.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.583
I want you all
to save my baby.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.951
Do you hear me?

20:19.953 --> 20:22.720
I'm ordering all of you!

20:22.722 --> 20:24.222
No matter what it takes.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.590
Save my baby!

20:25.592 --> 20:26.891
(grunting)
Stay back!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.359
If you come anywhere

20:28.361 --> 20:29.961
near her with those,
I will kill you myself.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.596
She's dying,
Lord Bothwell.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.531
The queen wants me
to save her child.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.968
Greer...

20:36.970 --> 20:39.237
Greer, I love you.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.939
(voice breaking):
I love you, too.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.978
♪ Breathe... ♪

20:46.980 --> 20:48.646

No, no, no, no.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.682
Don't give up.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.018
Mary, stay with me.
You have to fight!

20:54.020 --> 20:55.753
You can do this.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.688
It's your fate.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.390
It's our fate.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.460
Now gather your strength,
all of it

21:02.462 --> 21:04.028
and come back to me.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.964
Come back
and meet your child.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.404
(crying)

21:14.907 --> 21:17.308
Mary, come back to me.

(panting)

21:26.619 --> 21:28.853
I'm right here.
I'm with you.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.406
Queen Mary, you have a son.

(laughs)

21:53.880 --> 21:56.347
(baby crying)

22:01.954 --> 22:03.721
I've been waiting
a very long time to meet you,

22:03.723 --> 22:08.626
and you are more perfect
than I ever could have imagined.

22:11.364 --> 22:16.667
Where are you going?

22:16.669 --> 22:17.835
You need to rest.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.437
The doctor told me you
lost a lot of blood.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.738
I want you to stay.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.540
Mary, you said
it yourself.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.576
The baby is here. I need
to stay far away from you.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.712
Gossip can be dangerous.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.580
Bothwell?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.582
When I was giving birth, I...

22:31.584 --> 22:35.486
I felt myself slipping away,

22:35.488 --> 22:38.823
but it was your voice
that guided me back.

22:38.825 --> 22:42.560
If you hadn't been here,

22:42.562 --> 22:46.364
I wouldn't be holding my son
in my arms right now.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.434
I've been seeing it all wrong.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.603
The danger is not
in us being close.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.772
It's in our being apart.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.574
My enemies are going

22:56.576 --> 23:00.044
to gossip and lie about me
no matter what I do.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.381
As far as I'm concerned,
they can all go to hell.

23:03.383 --> 23:07.752
I going to spend the rest of
my life with the ones I love.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.687
(door opens)

23:21.667 --> 23:25.669
I'm so sorry to interrupt this,
but... something's happened.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.705
What is it, Greer?

23:27.707 --> 23:29.707
While you were giving birth,
Lady Lennox filled all

23:29.709 --> 23:31.575
of the remaining seats
on the privy council.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.411
What? She can't do that.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.012
You need a royal signature.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.580
It's Darnley.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.582
He shifted the balance
of power back to himself.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.718
While I was giving birth
to his child.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.787
This is Lady Lennox's doing.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.188
I need to talk to Darnley.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.956
I think I can still reach him.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.992
(birds singing)

23:49.128 --> 23:50.661
(sighs)

23:54.700 --> 23:58.002
(doors close)

23:58.004 --> 23:59.970
Thank you, Jane.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.507
I had some books sent over
to your house as a gift,

24:03.509 --> 24:05.910
but no one was home
to receive them.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.511
Oh.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.548
That was so kind of you,
Your Majesty.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.017
My family and I were
out at the market.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.618
Well, my page said

24:14.620 --> 24:16.787
your livestock
was wandering unattended.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.857
I hope your father's not
neglecting his animals.

24:21.494 --> 24:24.795
Your Majesty,
Naval Commander Francis Drake

24:24.797 --> 24:26.197
is here to see you.

24:26.199 --> 24:27.865
Please excuse us, Jane.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.636
Queen Elizabeth,

24:32.638 --> 24:34.538
we meet at last.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.041
My friend Hawkins
has told me much about you.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.743
I'm glad he could
arrange this meeting.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.947
I have a special mission

24:42.949 --> 24:45.583
that requires your naval
expertise and your ships.

24:45.585 --> 24:50.054
There's a Portuguese freighter
filled with jewels, gold, silver

24:50.056 --> 24:51.722
setting sail for Austria.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.824
I want that cargo for England.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.862
And what would your... friend,
the archduke, say to that?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.697
Well, aren't you clever?

24:59.699 --> 25:03.601
Let's just say this...
operation cannot be traced

25:03.603 --> 25:06.570
back to me, and you will
be well compensated.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.606
You'll utilize
blank sails,

25:08.608 --> 25:09.974
and hide any semblance
of British emblems

25:09.976 --> 25:11.108
during your attack.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.209
Your Majesty,
believe it or not,

25:12.211 --> 25:13.978
I have actually
done this before.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.815
I can pillage that cargo
in secret.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.517
Though there is always a risk.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.652
To me, it's worth the risk.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.053
Then you don't mind
paying me more.

25:23.055 --> 25:26.624
Say, 10% of the haul?

25:26.626 --> 25:30.227
I thought you came
as my loyal subject.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.530
You're the queen of England.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.266
Everyone who walks through these
doors wants something from you.

25:35.268 --> 25:38.669
If they say otherwise,
they're lying.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.838
Pay me what I ask,
and that cargo will be yours.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.873
On my honor.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.009
The king has chosen you
to join his privy council

25:45.011 --> 25:47.912
to defend his rights
as father to Scotland's heir.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.215
The welfare of this child
must be decided by this council,

25:51.217 --> 25:53.250
not by Queen Mary.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.185
MARY:
Continue, Lady Lennox.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.721
You were just saying
something about me?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.323
LADY LENNOX:
Gentlemen,

25:59.325 --> 26:00.991
please give us the room.

26:06.966 --> 26:10.034
I would like to speak
to my husband alone.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.836
Darnley,
do you want me to stay?

26:13.839 --> 26:16.307
Yes.

26:16.309 --> 26:18.042
I know what you're trying
to do, Mary.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.644
Trying to take my
son away from me.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.780
I won't let you.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.181
Darnley,
you are very ill.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.716
Your mother is
filling your head

26:25.718 --> 26:27.718
with lies.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.019
I just want to help you.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.287
By locking me away?

26:30.289 --> 26:32.189
Well, I won't let you.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.758
There is a motion
being passed tomorrow

26:34.760 --> 26:37.728
in front of the privy council
to appoint me

26:37.730 --> 26:39.296
the child's steward.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.631
No.

26:40.633 --> 26:43.300
Once I am named
steward of the heir,

26:43.302 --> 26:47.738
I will have the power to
keep you out of my son's life,

26:47.740 --> 26:49.173
just as you would have done me.
GREER: This is insane!

26:49.175 --> 26:50.908
What happens when Mary
tells the privy council

26:50.910 --> 26:53.644
you're infected
with syphilis?

26:53.646 --> 26:55.079
We will accuse her
of infecting the king,

26:55.081 --> 26:57.815
a result of her wanton adultery.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.184
Every choice she makes

27:00.186 --> 27:02.653
will be inspected for madness.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.688
Mary will lose her throne
in disgrace.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.991
Darnley,

27:06.993 --> 27:09.093
I am his mother.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.962
For the good of our child,
please be decent.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.365
Now you talk
of decency?

27:14.367 --> 27:16.100
When I have the power.

27:16.102 --> 27:20.037
Where was your decency when
I asked for my fair share?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.042
We're finished here.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.412
Darnley, please, you can't...

27:28.414 --> 27:29.913
(gasps)
Mary...

27:33.386 --> 27:36.787
Maybe you're the one
who needs help, Mary.

27:36.789 --> 27:48.699
You don't look well.

27:48.701 --> 27:49.933
(footfalls receding)

27:49.935 --> 27:50.934
Oh, Claude,

27:50.936 --> 27:53.203
where have you been?

27:53.205 --> 27:57.808
Charles has thrown your sister
in the dungeon.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.209
My dear, what's wrong?

27:59.211 --> 28:02.012
Leith is getting married.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.450
(crying):
I wrote to him,

28:06.452 --> 28:08.385
saying that my marriage
to Luc is over,

28:08.387 --> 28:10.888
that I was willing
to give up everything

28:10.890 --> 28:12.056
to finally be with him.

28:12.058 --> 28:15.859
Darling, I'm sorry.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.930
I tried so hard
to honor my promise to Leith,

28:19.932 --> 28:21.899
to be a good person,

28:21.901 --> 28:24.468
but it just wasn't enough.

28:24.470 --> 28:29.073
Keeping your promise because you
want to be good and honorable,

28:29.075 --> 28:31.709
isn't the same
as keeping your promise

28:31.711 --> 28:34.211
because you truly love someone.

28:34.213 --> 28:38.248
Maybe you don't love Leith
quite as much as you think.

28:38.250 --> 28:42.186
You have a husband
who values you,

28:42.188 --> 28:46.423
so you still have a chance
at happiness.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.459
(birds chirping)

28:49.428 --> 28:51.095
Francis Drake,

28:51.097 --> 28:54.364
you finally returned.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.066
I trust you have good news?

28:56.068 --> 28:58.135
Good news and bad,
Your Majesty.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.438
You gave me your word the cargo
would be intercepted discreetly.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.874
Don't worry, we
disguised our ships

29:03.876 --> 29:05.809
and took the freighter's
entire bounty.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.378
It's in the harbor now, being
loaded onto several carriages.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.013
Several carriages?
That's quite the haul.

29:10.015 --> 29:12.216
(sighs) The problem
is what came after.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.520
To avoid any connection
to our piracy,

29:16.522 --> 29:19.189
we cut through Spanish
waters on our way back here.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.158
We thought we'd be safer
in foreign territory

29:21.160 --> 29:24.161
by raising our English sails
in peace, but we ran afoul

29:24.163 --> 29:27.164
of some Spanish warships
who had a different idea:

29:27.166 --> 29:29.399
they wanted to search us.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.868
Did you engage them?

29:30.870 --> 29:32.770
I had no choice.

29:32.772 --> 29:33.937
One thing led to another.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.539
They fired on us,
so I fired back.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.343
We sunk two warships.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.911
It's no easy feat.

29:40.913 --> 29:45.082
You sunk two Spanish warships

29:45.084 --> 29:48.919
while our English sails billowed
in the wind for all to see?

29:48.921 --> 29:50.220
The Spanish
attacked first.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.955
As if that matters now.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.925
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

29:54.927 --> 29:56.326
How could you be
so shortsighted?

29:56.328 --> 29:58.028
King Philip has always

29:58.030 --> 30:02.099
desired England and now
he has grounds for war.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.035
Tell me, Your Majesty, was it
shortsighted of me to survive?

30:05.037 --> 30:07.337
You shouldn't have raised
the English sails at all.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.206
From where I stand,
they alone are keeping me alive.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.108
Now you can't just hand me over
to the Spaniards

30:11.110 --> 30:12.843
to take the fall,
which I'm sure would have been

30:12.845 --> 30:13.944
your first
inclination.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.913
You're damn right
it would have.

30:15.915 --> 30:20.217
Instead, I am facing a
possible war with Spain.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.253
You stick around,
Captain Drake.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.255
I have a feeling I'm
not through with you.

30:35.467 --> 30:38.268
Stop staring at me, witch!

30:38.270 --> 30:40.971
My name is Emanuelle.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.941
And I'm not looking at you.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.976
I'm gazing at your ugly,

30:45.978 --> 30:47.244
ugly soul.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.979
CATHERINE: I can see
you've made a friend.

30:48.981 --> 30:51.114
Mother, help me.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.250
That witch
is harassing me.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.986
(tsking, sniffs)
You poor dear,

30:55.988 --> 30:59.156
you're surrounded by all
of these godless devils,

30:59.158 --> 31:01.258
who no doubt wish
you were dead.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.559
You have to get me
out of here.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.361
I'm the queen
of Spain.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.097
Yes, but you're in France now,

31:07.099 --> 31:09.433
and you conspired
against the French king.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.369
You have overplayed
your hand,

31:12.371 --> 31:14.404
and you will suffer
the consequences.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.506
Those are Charles's words,
they're not mine.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.208
I'll write a letter
to Philip.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.110
I'm afraid that Philip,
he's a little bit busy

31:20.112 --> 31:22.546
at the moment
planning an attack on England.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.548
I intercepted

31:24.550 --> 31:28.418
this message sent
by your beloved husband,

31:28.420 --> 31:30.487
in which he informs you that,

31:30.489 --> 31:33.557
due to a little naval skirmish
with the English,

31:33.559 --> 31:36.026
those ships are
needed elsewhere.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.995
They won't be coming
to help Henri

31:37.997 --> 31:39.663
overthrow his brother
after all.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.531
So your coup has failed.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.903
I only wanted
to please Philip.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.572
I never wanted
to hurt Charles.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.174
I realize I may have gone
a little too far.

31:51.176 --> 31:55.412
Oh, I think Charles sees
it a bit differently.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.115
He's going to take
your head for this,

31:58.117 --> 32:00.050
and I can't stop him.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.119
Mommy, please.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.355
Get me out of here and I'll do
whatever you ask, I swear it.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.331
I can get you out of France,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.300
but it's gonna
cost you and Spain

32:16.302 --> 32:18.969
a very long list of favors.

32:23.008 --> 32:26.043
The physician says you'll
be back on your feet soon.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.612
It hardly matters.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.615
I can feel my power
in Scotland waning,

32:31.617 --> 32:33.317
along with my allies.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.719
I still have a few
loyal men on the privy council,

32:35.721 --> 32:39.156
but the rest
belong to the Lennoxes.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.694
They will vote to take my son

32:43.696 --> 32:46.096
and make Darnley his steward.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.631
You will figure a way
out of this.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.166
You always do.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.635
And now you have
your child to inspire you.

of Spanish warships

Leeza won't be a problem,
and neither will Henri.

35:47.412 --> 35:49.813
Spain is far too busy
with England.

35:49.815 --> 35:53.283
Their armada won't be coming,
so Henri has nothing.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.685
He'll have no choice
but to bow to you.

35:55.687 --> 35:59.156
So once you calm down,

an all-out war.

Does Henri know the
ships aren't coming?

36:06.565 --> 36:08.365
Not yet.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.167
Then he's vulnerable.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.669
This is the perfect time
to crush him.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.405
He is your blood.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.340
Just tell him that
the ships aren't coming,

36:17.342 --> 36:20.310
and he will return
to court with Nicole

36:20.312 --> 36:21.811
and admit his defeat.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.647
I don't know, you can send
him off to battle the Turks.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.215

36:25.217 --> 36:26.783

What about Nicole?

He's tarnished her honor,

36:28.487 --> 36:30.387
