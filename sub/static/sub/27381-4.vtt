WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:04.780
Mimi, what is it? I have a malignant
tumour in my left breast.

00:04.860 --> 00:09.180
Maybe we should just be friends.
No. I've got a lot of friends.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.140
I want more.
You...

00:12.100 --> 00:17.420
Did she tell you what she's planning
to do with the baby? If she had,
I wouldn't betray her confidence.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.140
It's not Michael's baby.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.900
Sam's gonna hate me.
You don't have to tell her.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.660
I enjoyed it so much

00:25.740 --> 00:29.580
that I'm not sure
I want it to be my last.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.020
'Time. The great master.

00:37.100 --> 00:40.540
Uncontrollable. Unstoppable.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.940
This beauty was crafted in 1933.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.060
Quite the year, actually.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.340
My mother was born.'

00:58.140 --> 01:01.140
You'll be here when I wake up?

01:02.140 --> 01:05.140
Well, I'll definitely be here
if you don't.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.100
Clamp, now!

01:11.260 --> 01:13.660
Oh, shit, we're losing her.
I'm no doctor,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.100
but this doesn't appear to be going
very well.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.140
BP's falling!

01:24.980 --> 01:27.140
Oh, is it over?

01:27.220 --> 01:29.220
The hardest part is.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.100
(CONTINUOUS TONE)

01:32.180 --> 01:35.300
'And that's the truth.
Dying is easy.

01:35.380 --> 01:38.100
It's living
that really takes it out of you.'

01:50.500 --> 01:52.740
(GASPS)

01:52.820 --> 01:56.100
Oh.
No pre-op jitters for you, then.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.500
You slept like a baby
for ten hours straight.

01:58.580 --> 02:03.980
Can you blame me?
Dealing with all of you
fussing over me is exhausting.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.580
Speaking of which,
Sam's already been here twice.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.500
Oh, I hate that
she's worrying about me.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.140
Will you look out of her?
Today?

02:15.220 --> 02:17.260
And after the surgery.

02:17.340 --> 02:21.460
I don't want her
spending all her days here

02:21.540 --> 02:24.020
locked in battle with Gina.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.100
There's more to life!

02:26.180 --> 02:29.940
How about we look after her together
when you come home?

02:42.620 --> 02:44.660
Running away again?

02:44.740 --> 02:46.740
It's enough to give a guy a complex.

02:46.820 --> 02:50.180
No running.
Promised to make a family breakfast.

02:51.220 --> 02:55.380
Am I invited?
Since when were you family?

02:55.460 --> 02:58.100
I'm in a relationship
with a family member.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.660
You think this is a relationship?

03:01.700 --> 03:06.220
Well, isn't it? Er...
I haven't really thought about it.

03:10.220 --> 03:12.180
Maybe you should.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.700
I'll call you.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.980
Where's Mimi?
Still sleeping last time I checked.

03:30.060 --> 03:34.060
Unbelievable. The woman's got
nerves of steel. Where have you been?

03:36.100 --> 03:39.900
Mason's. So much for your promise
of staying away from him.

03:39.980 --> 03:44.580
Annoyingly,
I think I really like him.

03:44.660 --> 03:48.660
The best sex in the world doesn't
change the fact that he is a snake.

03:48.740 --> 03:51.500
It's more than sex.
So go for it.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.780
You don't need my blessing.
I do, actually.

03:53.860 --> 03:57.860
Because if you can't forgive him,
I'm not sure I can.

03:58.940 --> 04:02.900
Fine. I just hope you know
what you're getting yourself into.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.940
Whatever the roses did,
they don't deserve that.

04:20.020 --> 04:22.100
Too much?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.180
We're all worried about her.

04:27.260 --> 04:30.340
How are you coping?
With what?

04:30.420 --> 04:33.100
Mimi. The baby.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.860
Mimi's gonna be fine. End of.

04:36.940 --> 04:41.100
And... as for the other thing...
Sammy.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.740
Look what the peacock dragged in.

04:47.340 --> 04:50.340
Thanks for coming.
I was so glad you called.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.540
You must have driven all night.
I'm no good at playing it cool.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.060
It was impressive, actually.

05:03.140 --> 05:05.780
She gave me her blessing

05:05.860 --> 05:09.420
while at the same time
making me feel like a complete idiot.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.660
I thought that today of all days
you'd have put down your weapons.
Never!

05:14.740 --> 05:19.900
She's right, of course.
Things will probably
go horrible wrong with Mason.

05:19.980 --> 05:23.060
Just like all the others have.

05:23.140 --> 05:28.860
What's the worst that could happen?
You end up pregnant and alone, back
living with your mother? Unlikely.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.980
Then you'll end up
with a broken heart,
and we both know that's not fatal.

05:35.340 --> 05:37.900
So... what about you?

05:39.100 --> 05:42.180
Can we talk about the thing
that we can't talk about yet?

05:46.940 --> 05:49.380
It just didn't work out.

05:49.460 --> 05:54.300
Once we were a regular couple,
the spark just disappeared.
Well, I told...

05:54.380 --> 05:57.260
Oh, so not the time for that speech.
No. Right. Yep.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.060
(SIGHS) We just became
bickering siblings

06:03.140 --> 06:06.700
living in filthy hostels
with no money. Not fun.

06:08.700 --> 06:12.740
And then one night we both said some
horrific things to each other...

06:13.740 --> 06:15.780
..and I went to this bar

06:15.860 --> 06:22.220
and met the most beautiful
Italian man I've ever seen. And...

06:23.700 --> 06:25.980
But... hang on.

06:26.060 --> 06:29.300
So this baby is Italian?
100 percent.

06:29.380 --> 06:32.340
Well, 75 percent. 25 percent Irish.

06:32.420 --> 06:35.420
This is a brilliant combination!
(LAUGHS)

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
Brava! (LAUGHS)

06:56.700 --> 06:58.820
Well, you just left.

06:58.900 --> 07:02.020
Yeah, because you told me to.
I didn't mean right away.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.700
Oh, so, what, you meant fuck off
but not immediately? (SIGHS)

07:06.740 --> 07:09.300
I don't know. (SIGHS)

07:09.380 --> 07:13.420
I thought maybe I'd made a mistake.
When I said I wanted you to go...

07:14.540 --> 07:20.340
..maybe that was... actually the
complete opposite of what I wanted.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.900
Shall we see where we could go?

07:25.780 --> 07:29.260
The thing is...
That is, if you still want me.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.660
I've never really wanted
anybody else.

07:56.420 --> 07:59.340
Where is she?
She said she'll be right down.

08:04.060 --> 08:07.300
I thought you were banished.
I've been offered a reprieve.

08:07.380 --> 08:10.220
You know Mimi can't eat any of this.
Why not?

08:10.300 --> 08:13.660
Cos she's fasting.
She can't even have a cup of coffee.

08:13.740 --> 08:18.540
All right, calm down, I'm not gonna
force-feed her French toast. OK!

08:19.540 --> 08:21.220
Oh.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.140
You clearly all think I'm about to
die, otherwise why the last supper?

08:28.460 --> 08:30.060
(SIGHS)

08:30.140 --> 08:33.140
Look, I appreciate all the support,
but...

08:34.700 --> 08:37.540
..I have a request.
Anything.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.140
Stand down, ladies.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.220
Don't come with me.

08:42.300 --> 08:46.660
I can deal with this much better
without you looking at me
with anguished faces.

08:46.740 --> 08:51.420
Absolutely not!
There's no way we're sending you
off to surgery in a taxi.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.060
Who said anything about a taxi?

08:54.140 --> 08:58.260
In case this is adieu
rather than au revoir,

08:58.340 --> 09:00.900
I have a nugget for you all.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.300
Do what feels right in your heart.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.580
There's no other way worth living.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.740
(CHUCKLES) Right!

09:11.820 --> 09:15.220
This could be my last trip,
so make it a good one.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.060
No pressure, then!
(LAUGHS)

09:19.140 --> 09:22.380
(ENGINE ROARS)
Yes!

09:22.460 --> 09:24.740
Ahh!

09:24.820 --> 09:26.940
(ROCK MUSIC)

09:30.380 --> 09:34.020
It's a routine procedure.
And she's in phenomenal shape.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.300
She'll be home before we know it.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.420
Right. Good talk.

09:43.540 --> 09:46.340
Do you know,
motherhood didn't come easy for me.

09:47.740 --> 09:50.380
I was sick
every day of the pregnancy

09:50.460 --> 09:53.060
and had depression for months after.

09:53.140 --> 09:55.420
But I did my best

09:55.500 --> 09:58.540
and that's really
all you can ever do.

09:59.540 --> 10:01.540
I know it seems daunting right now,

10:01.620 --> 10:06.380
but you have two grannies eager
to help... It isn't Michael's.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.020
What?

10:09.020 --> 10:11.780
But it doesn't matter,
we're still family.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.580
Has Gina known all along?

10:17.180 --> 10:19.540
Fucking Benellis!

10:21.220 --> 10:23.660
You're all the same!

10:23.740 --> 10:26.300
Liar and cheats!

10:27.380 --> 10:29.020
Fuck!

10:36.660 --> 10:39.100
Well, she'll calm down.
She always does.

10:39.180 --> 10:43.860
Don't bet on it. Her head
practically did a 360. Well,
your timing couldn't have been worse.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.780
I was trying to do the right thing!
She'll forgive you. Me?

10:46.860 --> 10:50.140
What about you?
You're the one who lied to her.

10:50.220 --> 10:55.100
Because you told me to! And even
when I tried to tell her, you
swooped in and changed the subject!

10:55.180 --> 10:59.660
I was looking out for you.
How? By ensuring she would hate me
when she found out the truth?

10:59.740 --> 11:02.300
No! That's not...
How would you have felt

11:02.380 --> 11:07.300
if it was the other way round,
thinking it was your grandchild,
then having it ripped away?

11:07.380 --> 11:10.540
It wasn't really about me, was it?
It was just about you and Sam

11:10.620 --> 11:13.820
and your ridiculous power games.
I got caught in the crossfire.

11:17.780 --> 11:21.300
Well, I had hoped
I'd die in my own bed,

11:21.380 --> 11:25.700
not in some damned establishment
wearing a recycled gown.

11:25.780 --> 11:30.660
You are not going to die.
General anaesthetic holds
much more risk for the elderly.

11:30.740 --> 11:37.180
And that's not taking into account
all the bugs that seem to be running
riot in our hospitals these days.

11:37.260 --> 11:39.820
OK. I'll make you a deal.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.660
If you make it out of here,
I'll finally take your advice

11:43.740 --> 11:46.420
and sign up for a dating app.
Hallelujah!

11:46.500 --> 11:49.740
If you don't have sex soon,
you'll forget where everything goes.

11:52.900 --> 11:57.100
Right. Onward unto the breach.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.020
What have I been doing here
all this time,

12:05.100 --> 12:09.180
wasting years of my life investing
in this place, in this family?

12:09.260 --> 12:11.740
People who have no moral code
whatsoever!

12:11.820 --> 12:16.340
Can we just stop for a minute?
Poor Michael is out there
heartbroken and alone,

12:16.420 --> 12:19.020
all because like mother,
like bloody daughter!

12:19.100 --> 12:21.820
Maybe you should give her
a chance to explain.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.740
Everybody makes mistakes.
If you just talk to her...

12:24.820 --> 12:28.020
No, no more talking.
It's got me absolutely nowhere.

12:28.100 --> 12:31.260
I can't do this any more. I can't.
Neither can I. Sammy...

12:31.340 --> 12:35.660
From now on,
I'm gonna focus on the people in my
life who I know won't let me down.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.540
Challenge of the day.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.780
Make the lunch special with...

13:01.180 --> 13:05.180
..these ingredients.
But lunch service is in an hour.

13:05.260 --> 13:09.060
Hence the challenge.
Don't let me down.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.820
He likes to keep us on our toes.
Why did this have to happen today?

13:17.900 --> 13:19.900
Why not today?

13:20.940 --> 13:24.660
Just I've, erm...
family stuff going on.

13:25.980 --> 13:27.900
Fuck.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.700
Have a little faith.
Mr Elliot adores you.

13:32.780 --> 13:37.500
He'll love whatever you come up
with. You think? Of course.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.380
And I can help you
with your food prep if you like.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.620
Let you get on with inventing.

13:44.660 --> 13:45.860
Thanks.

13:47.580 --> 13:48.860
Maybe...

13:51.980 --> 13:56.740
..you... just need to find
a way to relax.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.660
# Girlfriend

14:01.140 --> 14:03.820
# Don't feel like a girlfriend

14:06.100 --> 14:08.380
# But lover

14:09.620 --> 14:13.260
# Dammit, be a lover #

14:13.340 --> 14:15.860
Dio, would you just take it?

14:15.940 --> 14:17.900
Thanks very much.

14:17.980 --> 14:22.780
Sam, listen... I always knew
you were capable of some pretty
underhanded things, but this...

14:22.860 --> 14:26.860
What kind of person are you?
I can explain.
There is no possible explanation!

14:26.940 --> 14:30.620
You even had me doubting my own son,
thinking he was an absolute bastard

14:30.700 --> 14:34.740
for abandoning
his pregnant girlfriend.
We were going to tell you. When?

14:34.820 --> 14:39.380
At a time that suited you?
That's how you operate, isn't it?
Always putting your own needs

14:39.460 --> 14:43.500
in front of everyone else's,
especially mine!
Are you gonna let me speak? No!

14:43.580 --> 14:48.820
I don't know why I was even
surprised that Teresa was lying. She
learnt from the best. That's enough!

14:48.900 --> 14:52.260
Leave Teresa out of this.
You're right. It is enough.

15:03.460 --> 15:07.020
Any word from the hospital?
No, it's too soon. Sam?

15:08.140 --> 15:11.300
"She'll calm down. She just needs
time." What a load of arse.

15:12.740 --> 15:17.140
Er, just confirming that the chapel
is booked for our vow renewal.
Absolutely.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.100
Thank you.

15:19.180 --> 15:22.780
You know, we actually got married
there 30 years ago. Amazing.

15:22.860 --> 15:24.900
What's your secret?
Patience.

15:26.020 --> 15:30.420
And you have to be blind sometimes.
Deaf others. (LAUGHS)

15:30.500 --> 15:34.980
Although, really,
we had to get along.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.140
We didn't have anyone else.

15:37.220 --> 15:40.700
His parents didn't approve of me
and mine didn't approve of him.

15:40.780 --> 15:43.900
We didn't even have any guests
at our wedding.

15:45.940 --> 15:48.020
But it was a magical day
nonetheless.

15:48.100 --> 15:53.420
Look, let me make you
a proper wedding cake.
No extra cost, of course.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.140
Ohh, that would be wonderful.
Thank you.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.340
Erm, Andrew will show you
to your room. Great. Thanks.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.300
OK, this way.

16:12.020 --> 16:16.940
Chef, we're still waiting on orders
for tables 4, 9 and 12. I know.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
It's not what I was hoping for.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.940
We're gonna need a new special.
Oh, erm...

16:44.020 --> 16:45.980
What about this?

16:46.980 --> 16:50.460
It's just... something
I was working on this morning.

17:00.420 --> 17:04.140
Yeah. Good. Put it on the board.
Yes, sir.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.820
And put this... in the bin,

17:08.900 --> 17:11.420
where sadly it belongs.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.820
Good work, Rhiannon.
Chef.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.060
(SIGHS)

17:46.020 --> 17:48.700
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.380
I'm definitely the luckiest.

18:08.260 --> 18:12.140
Isn't this a bit drastic,
making a decision like this
on a day like today?

18:12.220 --> 18:14.380
It is exactly the best day.

18:14.460 --> 18:18.740
Do you think Mimi would stick around
if someone had done this to her?
Take a breath.

18:18.820 --> 18:22.460
I was only ever here because of Leo.
I mean, who was I kidding?

18:22.540 --> 18:27.580
As if I could ever trust her,
after all she's done!
Just promise me one thing.

18:27.660 --> 18:30.460
No lies, OK? Whatever happens.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.700
OK.

18:35.540 --> 18:39.180
Just stop for a second.
I mean really. Really.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.340
Just stop.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.060
Maybe, er... take a seat.

18:44.140 --> 18:45.740
(SIGHS)

18:54.980 --> 18:57.500
I slept with someone
at Mimi's party,

18:57.580 --> 19:00.260
after we split up.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.660
I was hurt.

19:05.740 --> 19:07.860
Heartbroken.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.820
Who was it?

19:10.860 --> 19:13.540
Janice. Mimi's doctor.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.540
OK.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.180
Really?
Sure.

19:23.460 --> 19:27.540
You can leave now.
Sammy, please. Get out.

19:40.340 --> 19:44.340
How's that, then?
Yeah. Face it the other way.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.420
No, the other other way.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.740
Yeah. That's it.

19:51.820 --> 19:56.620
Is this your way of getting me up
the aisle? Don't flatter yourself.

19:56.700 --> 20:00.900
I must admit, this rent-a-crowd
venture is a new one on me.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.820
(SIGHS)

20:05.140 --> 20:08.940
What's wrong? I well and truly
screwed up with Sam.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.980
Apologise, then.

20:11.060 --> 20:14.500
I tried. I just don't think
we can get past this.

20:16.140 --> 20:18.420
So what now?
Dunno.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.460
I just... want her to be happy.

20:22.540 --> 20:24.180
(DOOR BANGS)

20:28.460 --> 20:32.340
Thank you so much.
What's all this?

20:32.420 --> 20:36.220
Well, everyone deserves
a proper wedding day with flowers

20:36.300 --> 20:40.540
and guests and a maid of honour,
if you'll have me. Yes.

20:40.620 --> 20:41.820
Mason.

20:42.820 --> 20:45.220
I'm your best man, I believe.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.100
Thank you.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.820
You owe me.

21:18.260 --> 21:21.580
Excuse me?
You know what you did.

21:21.660 --> 21:24.100
And it's time to make amends.

21:24.180 --> 21:27.460
Go on.
I want out of the Penrose.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.700
Away from here altogether.

21:30.820 --> 21:34.780
Surely with your connections,
you can help me secure a position
elsewhere.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.500
I don't think that's a good idea.
Meaning?

21:37.580 --> 21:39.700
Meaning Gina would kill me.

21:39.780 --> 21:43.420
That's really not my problem.
This is between me and you.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.460
And we both know it's the very least
you could do for me.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.060
I'll see what I can do.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.500
I'm so grateful to you
for all of this.

22:24.580 --> 22:28.700
We both lost a lot
when we chose each other.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.020
Of course.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.420
(PHONE BUZZES)
Oh. Excuse me.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.860
Teresa?

22:36.940 --> 22:39.300
Calm down. Calm down.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.980
Sam! Sam! Sam!
Get out of my way.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.340
Teresa called from the hospital.
They think Mimi's had a stroke.

22:57.940 --> 23:00.580
(MONITOR BEEPS)

23:13.020 --> 23:16.540
What's happening? The nurse said
she should have woken up by now.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.380
I'm going to find a doctor.
OK.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.620
You OK?

23:28.700 --> 23:32.300
Yeah, I'm fine.
Erm... I'll be back in a minute.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.940
Teresa.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.860
What's happening?

23:44.140 --> 23:46.940
What if I lose it?
Don't.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.860
What if it sensed
that I wasn't sure?

23:50.940 --> 23:54.220
What if it didn't feel loved?
Stop!

23:54.300 --> 23:58.700
That baby is blissfully unaware
of all the chaos out here,

23:58.780 --> 24:03.340
including your feelings.
Just try to relax. Yeah.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.460
Can you see it?

24:12.540 --> 24:14.740
Erm...

24:19.900 --> 24:23.260
I'm sorry. I can't find a heartbeat.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.540
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
I heard it just last week.

24:27.620 --> 24:32.100
I'm sorry. Stop saying fucking
sorry! Just do the scan again.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.180
Yes, you can. Mum!

24:34.260 --> 24:37.260
Teresa...
Mum, why isn't she doing it again?

24:37.340 --> 24:42.020
Why isn't she doing it? Mum!
Teresa... Please do it again! No.
No.

24:43.180 --> 24:47.420
(SOBS)
Oh! Oh, my darling.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.860
(SOBS)

25:03.380 --> 25:05.860
You died in a room like this.

25:07.780 --> 25:10.140
Well, this is awkward.

25:11.860 --> 25:14.940
Is it selfish of me
to want her to stay alive...

25:16.060 --> 25:18.180
..because I need her?

25:20.140 --> 25:22.780
Maybe you've never been
selfish enough.

25:26.020 --> 25:29.500
Without you here, without Michael...

25:30.620 --> 25:33.460
..maybe without Mimi...

25:34.460 --> 25:36.580
..I don't know where I belong.

25:44.380 --> 25:47.740
You know, I wouldn't have minded
if you'd taken that job in London

25:47.820 --> 25:50.060
when we got married.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.460
Of course you would.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.740
You wanted me to be here.

25:57.460 --> 25:59.060
No.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.460
I wanted you to be happy.

26:08.260 --> 26:10.900
(MONITOR BEEPS)

26:18.060 --> 26:19.740
How's Mimi?

26:20.980 --> 26:24.100
We're still waiting.
Right.

26:24.180 --> 26:28.340
I'll, erm... I'll come back later.
What for?

26:29.740 --> 26:33.460
So we can talk.
I have nothing more to say.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.620
You broke up with me.

26:35.700 --> 26:38.460
I was devastated.
I wasn't thinking straight.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.620
Of all people,

26:40.700 --> 26:43.220
I really thought I could trust you.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.060
You can.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.460
I'm so sorry, Sammy.

26:51.060 --> 26:53.300
(ALARM BEEPS)

26:57.700 --> 27:02.140
Who do I have to screw
to get a slice of toast around here?
I'm starving!

27:02.220 --> 27:04.340
Oh, thank God!

27:04.420 --> 27:06.780
Please?
Let's just check you over first.

27:06.860 --> 27:11.900
A cup of tea, maybe? I'll get you
a cup of tea. Oh, thank you!

27:14.460 --> 27:17.340
I didn't actually realise
how much I wanted it

27:17.420 --> 27:19.500
till the scan was happening.

27:20.980 --> 27:23.500
How much I'd made plans for it.

27:25.060 --> 27:29.500
How fucked up is that?
That is not fucked up at all.

27:29.580 --> 27:33.340
I think you've been incredible
throughout all of this.

27:33.420 --> 27:35.660
I've never been so proud.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.980
(SNIFFS)

27:43.340 --> 27:45.500
Where is she?

27:45.580 --> 27:48.940
They've taken her for some tests,
but she seems fine.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.340
Teresa lost the baby.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.340
I'm so sorry.

28:04.180 --> 28:08.100
Is she OK?
She will be.

28:09.140 --> 28:12.220
Listen, erm, about before...

28:12.300 --> 28:16.100
This experiment just hasn't
worked out between us, has it?

28:19.500 --> 28:23.860
I'm leaving. This way
we can all move on with our lives.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.820
Right. That's, er...
That's fine by me.

28:31.900 --> 28:35.500
I can finally run the place
the way I want to.

28:36.580 --> 28:39.020
Well, that's decided, then.

28:39.100 --> 28:42.140
Not partners, not friends,
not family.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.300
Yeah.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.820
Yeah.

29:02.780 --> 29:05.980
'What a difference
a little time can make.

29:06.060 --> 29:11.140
A minute, a day, a week, a month.

29:11.220 --> 29:14.020
A whole life can change.

29:14.100 --> 29:17.780
Friendships can collapse,
families split apart.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.420
But for every door that slams shut,

29:24.500 --> 29:27.060
a new one springs open
in its place.'

29:27.140 --> 29:29.980
Hi!
Welcome to La Fontaine.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.220
Thank you.
Can I show you to your table?

29:36.940 --> 29:41.220
I had two miscarriages
before I had Leo.

29:42.660 --> 29:46.020
And I carry that with me always

29:46.100 --> 29:49.100
as a reminder that life is precious.

29:51.140 --> 29:53.220
Is this what growing up feels like?

29:54.300 --> 29:57.540
You're talking to the wrong person,
dear! That's true.

29:57.620 --> 30:01.460
Our battle scars are what make us.

30:01.540 --> 30:05.820
They show us that we were wounded
but not defeated.

30:07.100 --> 30:11.460
I just, I can't stand the thought of
you leaving, of all this being over.

30:13.420 --> 30:16.500
There's a time for everything, dear.

30:18.460 --> 30:21.220
..champagne to celebrate.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.580
Sorry.
It suits you. What does?

30:24.660 --> 30:28.620
This place. If it was a dress,
it would be a perfect fit.

30:28.700 --> 30:31.540
Oh, well, so far, so good.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.020
Thank you.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.060
Thank you.
Enjoy.

30:38.140 --> 30:41.500
The staff seem gloriously
uncomplicated and professional.

30:41.580 --> 30:45.340
Yeah, but they're just trying
to impress their new boss. (LAUGHS)

30:45.420 --> 30:46.860
Well...

30:49.060 --> 30:51.740
..long may the good times last.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.380
How did Sam find anything?

30:56.460 --> 31:00.780
Probably cos she didn't just
chuck stuff at her desk.
What are you looking for?

31:02.020 --> 31:04.340
I may have taken a booking
for a wedding

31:04.420 --> 31:07.780
on the same night that Sam confirmed
a 40th birthday party.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.500
Now the groom is threatening to sue.
No! No! No!

31:10.580 --> 31:15.860
What are you doing even taking
bookings? You're not allowed.
Sam told me. I can handle that. Oh!

31:15.940 --> 31:18.820
You have to call her.
Call who, sorry?

31:18.900 --> 31:22.740
Cher. Who do you think? You've been
miserable for weeks. Admit it.

31:22.820 --> 31:28.060
No, I haven't. I'm perfectly
all right. Bullshit. Call her

31:29.100 --> 31:33.980
You can. You just need to swallow
your enormous ego for once.

31:36.340 --> 31:38.420
What...

31:38.500 --> 31:41.540
It's all right. Just disappear.
I've got this.

31:49.380 --> 31:51.820
Shouldn't you be at lunch service?

31:51.900 --> 31:53.980
I can't cook.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.860
And I can always cook.

31:56.940 --> 32:01.340
It just doesn't feel right.
Sam should be here.
I feel like Torvill without Dean.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.500
More like Tom without Jerry,
from what I could see.

32:05.780 --> 32:11.500
If you hadn't got her that job
in that poncey hotel, we might have
been able to work things out.

32:11.580 --> 32:15.860
You said you wanted her to be happy.
Here! I wanted her to be happy here!

32:15.940 --> 32:21.060
Well, I owed her a good turn.
Well, you should never have got
involved! She's my business partner.

32:21.140 --> 32:27.180
But you're complete opposites.
You fight like cats and dogs.
I know! That's how it works!

32:27.260 --> 32:29.740
(SIGHS) This is totally confusing.

32:30.740 --> 32:35.140
Whatever this is between us
is never going to work out

32:35.220 --> 32:38.500
if you're going to go interfering
behind my back.

32:38.580 --> 32:42.460
Interfering?
It was a peace offering.

32:42.540 --> 32:46.780
And one that could have destroyed
everything that I've worked so hard
to create.

32:46.860 --> 32:50.580
You can blame me all you want, but
the truth is she was going anyway.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.220
This place...

32:54.300 --> 32:56.820
it just wasn't enough for her
any more.

33:03.580 --> 33:05.460
Service!

33:12.060 --> 33:17.460
Where's Gina? I've no idea, but when
I find her, I'm going to kill her.

33:17.540 --> 33:21.260
What are you doing here?
I just needed a bit of normality.

33:21.340 --> 33:24.980
This place is your normal? You do
realise how crazy that makes you?

33:32.580 --> 33:34.780
Welcome.

33:34.860 --> 33:38.700
It'll be a quick turnaround.
And we're full this evening, so...

33:39.940 --> 33:42.180
Can you take over for me for a sec?

33:44.340 --> 33:46.380
Nice place.
It is.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.820
I'm lying. It smells funny.
I hate it. Come home.

33:49.900 --> 33:54.140
Don't. I mean it. You don't belong
here. You're wasting your time.

33:54.220 --> 33:58.220
Look, I know I should've told you
about the baby.

34:02.860 --> 34:06.140
I didn't want to disappoint you.

34:06.220 --> 34:08.420
I knew how excited you were,
we all were.

34:08.500 --> 34:12.820
I'm doing what's best for me now.
But we're what's best for you.
We're your family.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.260
And the Penrose is a family business.

34:15.340 --> 34:18.260
That's what we love about it.
La familia. It's in our blood.

34:18.340 --> 34:23.700
But we're not blood. We never were.
We were just pretending to be.
And see how well that turned out.

34:23.780 --> 34:27.380
Well, the Penrose
just doesn't feel right without you.

34:27.460 --> 34:32.220
First Adam, then you,
and now you're taking Mimi.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.740
It's all unravelling.

34:34.820 --> 34:37.540
I was only ever
playing support there.

34:37.620 --> 34:39.900
To Leo and then to you.

34:39.980 --> 34:44.940
I want to see what happens
when I give myself that space
to put myself first.

34:45.980 --> 34:51.460
You're right. It was all about me.
But not any more.

34:55.180 --> 35:00.260
It's about a mile or so from the
Penrose. It's perfect for the spa.

35:00.340 --> 35:04.660
I sold the rest of the wine.
I put a deposit down this morning.

35:04.740 --> 35:08.020
It's yours... if you want it.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.820
It's too late. I work here now.

35:19.900 --> 35:22.660
And this is what you really want?
It is.

35:31.300 --> 35:35.300
We're having a family supper
on Sunday, before Mimi moves out.

35:35.380 --> 35:39.180
You should come.
We might not all be together again.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.300
I already have plans.

35:44.020 --> 35:45.820
Good luck, Sam.

35:50.180 --> 35:54.660
'It's like losing a limb,
letting go of the ones you love.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.500
Even the people
that hurt you the most.'

36:02.380 --> 36:07.380
Er, excuse me, chef who doesn't
work here any more, unhand my pots!

36:07.460 --> 36:11.460
You were gone
and I just... got stuck in.

36:11.540 --> 36:15.780
Right.
Well, I'm here now, so you can get
back to your posh, weightless food.

36:17.900 --> 36:22.220
What if I don't want to? It's not
just about the cooking for me.

36:22.300 --> 36:26.980
It's all of it.
It's about being around people
who know me and care about me.

36:27.060 --> 36:30.940
People who I can trust.
There is no substitute for that.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.260
You made your bed.

36:35.140 --> 36:38.900
I know, but fuck that!
I wanna come home.

36:41.660 --> 36:44.260
You took bloody long enough.

36:44.340 --> 36:46.740
(CHUCKLES)

36:52.860 --> 36:54.460
Thank you.

37:02.740 --> 37:08.340
I thought you might like to know
that your head chef has resigned.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.620
I heard.

37:10.700 --> 37:14.100
It's not the first time Rhiannon
has scared off the competition.

37:14.180 --> 37:17.260
Well, Adam has a very big heart.
I know.

37:17.340 --> 37:19.820
That's why he never stood a chance.

37:21.980 --> 37:25.100
So, that makes it one-all, then.

37:25.180 --> 37:29.420
Sam is blissfully happy and won't
be coming home, thanks to you.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.020
I don't wanna fight.

37:31.100 --> 37:34.420
Yeah, I... I know.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.900
(SIGHS)

37:41.460 --> 37:44.420
So where does that leave us, then?

37:44.500 --> 37:46.980
(SIGHS)

37:47.060 --> 37:50.740
Like any other new couple, I guess.

37:51.740 --> 37:53.780
At the beginning.

38:00.180 --> 38:02.620
So what brought you back to us,
then?

38:02.700 --> 38:05.180
It was like Gladiator in there.

38:05.260 --> 38:10.060
That kind of ambition,
it's ruthless. I don't wanna spend
my days looking over my shoulder.

38:10.140 --> 38:11.940
I'd much rather be here.

38:12.020 --> 38:17.260
You do realise
we're completely dysfunctional.
Yeah, but I already knew that.

38:18.260 --> 38:22.060
For what it's worth,
I think you might actually be
a better chef than my mum.

38:22.140 --> 38:26.340
But if you tell her I said that,
I will have to kill you
and bury you in her compost heap.

38:27.340 --> 38:30.020
Seriously... I needed that.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.740
Oh, shit! I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

38:34.820 --> 38:37.460
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

38:40.300 --> 38:43.140
It is actually fine. It doesn't...

38:43.220 --> 38:45.500
I actually can't feel
anything at all.

39:01.140 --> 39:05.340
Mrs Hasni! Looking beautiful!
What a pretty dress!

39:05.420 --> 39:07.700
Oh. Just a little something.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.180
Oh, you're too kind.
You shouldn't have.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.420
Here he is now.

39:12.500 --> 39:16.380
Look who's come to visit you,
Mr Hasni. Hi.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.220
And you are?

39:21.540 --> 39:24.060
I'm Keira, darling.

39:24.140 --> 39:26.140
I'm your wife.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.620
You enjoy yourselves now.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.620
Let's go and have a cup of tea, hm?

39:38.620 --> 39:40.860
(PHONE RINGS)

39:42.180 --> 39:44.820
'There's a time for everything.'

39:44.900 --> 39:46.460
Michael?

39:46.540 --> 39:48.060
Finally!

39:49.300 --> 39:52.140
'A time to live

39:52.220 --> 39:54.340
and a time to die.'

39:55.740 --> 39:57.500
Thank you.

40:00.340 --> 40:03.060
'A time to hold on

40:03.140 --> 40:05.380
and a time to let go.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.460
A time for war

40:19.540 --> 40:21.860
and a time for peace.'

40:27.700 --> 40:33.220
I wish I could think of something
more original to say than I'm sorry,
but that is exactly what I am.

40:33.300 --> 40:37.860
I am so sorry that in trying
not to hurt you, I ended up

40:37.940 --> 40:43.340
Michael called.
He told me things were pretty much
over between you before...

40:45.380 --> 40:47.740
I'm sorry about the baby.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.380
Here she is.

40:54.660 --> 40:58.620
There she is.
Are you all packed? Yes, of course!

40:58.700 --> 41:00.580
But...

41:03.020 --> 41:06.180
..I'm not coming with you, dear.
What?

41:06.260 --> 41:12.140
I've booked myself into a luxury
health resort on Lake Como!

41:12.220 --> 41:13.900
Indefinitely.

41:13.980 --> 41:16.860
You see, I want to recover in style,

41:16.940 --> 41:21.980
not watching Judge Judy
in a granny flat.

41:22.060 --> 41:24.340
I'm sorry.

41:27.340 --> 41:28.900
All right?

41:31.140 --> 41:33.380
Oh! Look at that!

41:35.580 --> 41:38.140
I'm so glad you came.

41:38.220 --> 41:41.820
I couldn't resist
one last Gina Benelli feast.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.740
Let's eat, then.

41:46.260 --> 41:48.460
(ALL LAUGH)

41:48.540 --> 41:53.220
Ooh! I'll have some spaghetti.
Right. OK. Thank you.
Let's eat, everyone.

41:53.300 --> 41:56.300
Delicious.
This looks great.

41:59.260 --> 42:01.700
Some spaghetti for you.
Oh, lovely!

42:01.780 --> 42:03.740
That's enough. That's enough.

42:03.820 --> 42:08.620
What is that?
We call that long green spaghetti,
if you're interested in it.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.420
Mm!

42:18.260 --> 42:21.740
So, apparently,
pregnancy can affect allergies.

42:21.820 --> 42:26.580
So carrying a baby forces the body
to accept something foreign.
So the baby cured you?

42:26.660 --> 42:28.340
I guess it did.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.580
Are you sure about this?

42:34.580 --> 42:39.220
I am 23 years old and I have never
been in a swimming pool.

42:43.340 --> 42:45.780
Fair enough.

42:45.860 --> 42:49.500
# PRIMAL SCREAM: Movin' On Up

42:53.300 --> 42:55.620
# I was blind

42:55.700 --> 42:58.140
# Now I can see

42:58.220 --> 43:01.180
# You made a believer

43:01.260 --> 43:03.540
# Out of me

43:03.620 --> 43:06.060
# I was blind

43:06.140 --> 43:08.580
# Now I can see

43:08.660 --> 43:11.180
# You made a believer

43:11.260 --> 43:13.260
# Out of me

43:13.340 --> 43:15.580
# I'm moving on up now

43:17.820 --> 43:21.340
# Getting out of the darkness

43:23.100 --> 43:25.660
# My light shines on

43:25.740 --> 43:28.300
# My light shines on

43:28.380 --> 43:29.620
# My light shines on...

43:29.700 --> 43:33.620
So, is it just dinner
and tonight, then?

43:33.700 --> 43:36.180
Or... are you in?

43:38.460 --> 43:40.500
You're impossible.

43:40.580 --> 43:43.220
Mm. And you're infuriating.

43:46.620 --> 43:48.980
I'll think about it.

43:50.460 --> 43:53.380
'That's the problem with life.

43:53.460 --> 43:57.860
You don't even realise you're in
this crazy kaleidoscope of glory

43:57.940 --> 44:00.060
until it's too late.'

44:01.180 --> 44:03.820
# My light shines on

44:06.260 --> 44:08.580
'Take it from me.

44:08.660 --> 44:10.820
Every second is precious.

44:12.060 --> 44:14.380
Don't waste a heartbeat.'

44:15.820 --> 44:19.060
# My light shines on

44:21.540 --> 44:24.180
# My light shines on

44:26.620 --> 44:29.220
# My light shines on

44:31.580 --> 44:34.140
# My light shines on

44:36.740 --> 44:39.500
# My light shines on #
