02:09.041 --> 02:11.416
It did not look like this
on the internet.

02:14.041 --> 02:16.291
Yeah, I don't remember
it being this sausage color.

02:17.291 --> 02:19.583
Oh, man, it's a dump!

02:20.750 --> 02:21.791
It's not so bad.

02:23.208 --> 02:24.083
We can fix it.

02:31.541 --> 02:32.583
We can start with that.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.916
Okay, that's the last box, Mum.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Thanks, Jack.
I'm gonna take a look at the new shop.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.958
How about you ride down,
and I'll see you there?

02:48.041 --> 02:48.916
No worries, Mum.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.416
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:40.750 --> 03:41.625
Need some help?

03:42.541 --> 03:45.625
Actually, you have an invite.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.916
Her mum heard
we moved into town.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.375
Go-karts are for kids, Mum.

03:52.458 --> 03:54.041
Uh, you're a kid.

03:54.125 --> 03:57.125
I prefer you driving one of those
than pulling cupcakes in my car.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.208
-They're called donuts, thank you.
-I know what they're called.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.041
-Stop doing them.
-I won't even know anyone.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.000
That's the point.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.708
You'll go to school with these kids
once the holidays are over.

04:08.708 --> 04:09.583
I don't know.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.375
Look, here are your choices.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.541
You either go to the party,

04:13.625 --> 04:16.208

With you. Yeah.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.291
I'm Colin. Colin Faber.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.625
Jack. Jack Hooper. Nice to meet you.

05:19.208 --> 05:20.291
They're so fast.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.500
They are, aren't they?

05:23.541 --> 05:25.791
I'm a bit nervous
about driving one of these things.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.458
-I've never done it before.
-Neither have I.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.625

05:36.041 --> 05:37.416
Hey, it'll be an adventure.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.041
Who's the dude man?

05:44.750 --> 05:45.666
Dean Zeta.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.500
State kart champion.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.541
Everyone thinks
he'll win Nationals this year.

05:49.708 --> 05:52.166
Remember when I asked you
if you were laughing with me or at me?

05:52.666 --> 05:53.916
It was, like, one minute ago.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.916
Yeah, well, he and his mates
laugh <i>at </i>me.

05:56.291 --> 05:57.500
Hey, out of the way.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.458
I know. They're dim-witted vulgarians,

06:04.541 --> 06:07.250
but I prefer to just ignore them
and get on with my day.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.250
Come on.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.375
That's embarrassing.

06:42.791 --> 06:44.458
Woo-hoo!

06:46.666 --> 06:48.708
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:51.333 --> 06:52.916
Yeah!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.458
How you going?

07:03.041 --> 07:04.166
Woo!

07:23.041 --> 07:24.083
Here I come, dude man!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.125
Woo-hoo!

07:35.458 --> 07:36.291
Yeah!

07:38.875 --> 07:39.708
Come on.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.458
Move!

07:53.541 --> 07:54.500
<i>Show no fear, mate.</i>

08:07.083 --> 08:08.166
Hey, Patrick.

08:10.125 --> 08:10.958
Mike.

08:14.166 --> 08:17.166
Thanks for holding the party here.
I appreciate the business.

08:17.791 --> 08:18.750
Yeah, of course.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.541
Have you thought anymore
about coaching my boy?

08:24.166 --> 08:25.000
Can't do it.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.791
Dean has a real shot at Nationals
this year.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.791
All he needs someone with experience
to help him get ready.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.375
And you'd make a great asset to our team,
Patrick.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.625
Well, like I said, that's...

08:37.125 --> 08:38.291
not gonna happen.

08:38.708 --> 08:39.583
Why not?

08:39.666 --> 08:43.208
Because your boy
doesn't have enough talent and...

08:43.791 --> 08:45.000
I can't teach that.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.041
Yeah.

08:54.125 --> 08:54.958
Hey.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.791
How long have you been karting?

08:58.875 --> 08:59.791
Um...

09:00.541 --> 09:01.583
about ten minutes.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.333
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:03.416 --> 09:04.500
You were pretty good.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.250
I don't know. I mean, I slid off.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.583
That's because you went
on the outside of the track.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.375
That's where the marbles are.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.625
There were marbles on the track?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.875
Not those kind of marbles.

09:16.958 --> 09:20.958
All the loose bits of dirt and rubber
from the tires are swept onto the outside,

09:21.041 --> 09:23.791
and when you drive over them,
they're super slippery.

09:23.875 --> 09:24.833
Huh.

09:24.916 --> 09:25.916
Um, I'm Jack.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.166
-Mandy.
-Nice to meet you.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.833
So you, uh...

09:33.583 --> 09:34.875
race karts?

09:34.958 --> 09:37.833
Yeah, but I prefer to make 'em go faster.

09:37.916 --> 09:39.166
So you're like a mechanic?

09:39.250 --> 09:41.750
Well, they're actually called
chief engineers, but yeah.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.125
I want to work in Formula 1 one day.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.541
-Cool.
- Mandy.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.125
Ready with the cake.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.333
Okay.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.458
-All right, I'll see you soon.
-Yeah.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.666
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.166
-That's a nice dog.
-Thanks.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.291
Looks like he's got rabies.

09:58.833 --> 09:59.833
What's your problem?

10:00.416 --> 10:02.541
When you spun off, you nearly took me out.

10:02.625 --> 10:04.458
I think you're mad
because I almost beat you.

10:04.541 --> 10:05.833
Ooh.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.250
See, that would never happen.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.375
I had you.

10:09.958 --> 10:10.875
And you know it.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.083
Stay out of my way.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.416
That's your first and only warning.

10:32.416 --> 10:33.791
I really showed him, huh?

10:43.041 --> 10:44.458

10:45.333 --> 10:47.583

11:00.750 --> 11:02.625
Oh, Dean? He's Mandy's brother.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.791
Of course he is.

11:30.333 --> 11:31.958
Never gonna beat you, am I, Dad?

12:27.916 --> 12:28.875
Evening, Dennis.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.166
After everything that happened in Sydney,

12:35.250 --> 12:38.416
you take my car again,
two days after we get here.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.333
Mum, I was in the middle of nowhere.

12:40.916 --> 12:42.375
I mean, there was no traffic.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.541
And I'm driving a station wagon.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.833
Isn't that true?

12:49.625 --> 12:50.458
Um...

12:55.583 --> 12:58.125
You were chucking donuts
in an empty car park, son.

12:58.791 --> 12:59.958
Without a license.

13:00.416 --> 13:02.958
I apologize, officer.
It will not happen again.

13:04.875 --> 13:05.708
Well...

13:07.291 --> 13:09.125
considering there was no harm done,

13:09.250 --> 13:11.000
I'm prepared to let you off
with a warning.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.750
A stern warning.

13:13.458 --> 13:17.083
If I catch you at it again,
you will be in very hot water.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.833
Understood?

13:22.083 --> 13:23.208
Well, I should hit the road.

13:24.625 --> 13:27.208
The old frog and toad.

13:34.458 --> 13:35.291
Uh, I'm...

13:36.083 --> 13:37.500
Officer Barry Johansen...

13:38.208 --> 13:40.083
-by the way.
-Sorry. Christie Hooper.

13:41.125 --> 13:41.958
Pleasure.

13:43.416 --> 13:44.666
Have you just moved into town?

13:44.750 --> 13:48.125
Yeah, we're taking a lease
on a shop on Queen Street.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.541
-Really?
- Yes.

13:49.875 --> 13:50.875
That's great.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.458
Well, I might see you around sometime,
at some point.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
In the future...

13:56.500 --> 13:57.333
perhaps.

13:57.416 --> 13:58.250
Okay.

13:58.458 --> 13:59.375
Okay.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.166
Evening.

14:03.583 --> 14:04.750
Thank you, officer.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.375
-Bye, Barry.
- Jack!

14:06.791 --> 14:07.625
What?

14:13.416 --> 14:15.250
You're doing donuts again?

14:15.625 --> 14:16.666
What's going on?

14:17.375 --> 14:18.208
Nothing.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.375
Well, why do you keep doing it?

14:21.083 --> 14:21.916
I don't know.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.333
That's not a good enough reason, mate.

14:24.416 --> 14:25.958
One day, your luck's gonna run out.

14:26.458 --> 14:27.416
And it won't end well.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.458
I'm hoping that we can build a life here.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.708
You know you can tell me anything.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.291
-Maybe you want to talk to me about Dad--
-Mum, I'm fine.

14:48.958 --> 14:52.250
Look. I got sausage because it matches
the color of this house.

15:10.541 --> 15:12.458
Far out. It's so expensive.

15:34.916 --> 15:35.750
So...

15:36.750 --> 15:38.541
you've been bitten by the racing bug.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.375
Is that when you can't stop thinking
about how much of a rush it is?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.000
And you feel like
it's what you were put on earth to do?

15:45.083 --> 15:46.083
That's it.

15:46.791 --> 15:47.916
Then I've been bitten.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.625
Well...

15:50.750 --> 15:52.041
I think that's great.

15:53.916 --> 15:54.833
Now...

15:56.250 --> 15:57.958
I reckon you should turn around...

15:58.541 --> 15:59.750
go home...

16:01.041 --> 16:02.541
and never speak of it again.

16:03.791 --> 16:04.666
Excuse me?

16:06.000 --> 16:09.875
You had one three-lap race
in which you spun off and finished last,

16:09.958 --> 16:11.791
and now you want to make it
your life's work?

16:11.875 --> 16:13.458
You know what would be a better idea?

16:13.541 --> 16:15.750
Collect every dollar you have,

16:15.833 --> 16:18.125
and your parents have,
and your friends have...

16:18.750 --> 16:20.708
and buy the nicest boat you can.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.625
Park it in the middle of the harbor...

16:23.333 --> 16:24.333
blow it up...

16:24.791 --> 16:25.833
and watch it sink.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.291
That'd be a better use
of your time and money

16:28.375 --> 16:29.958
than trying to make it as a race driver.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.083
Wow.

16:32.833 --> 16:33.708
You're the worst.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.791
Hit the bricks, kid.
You don't want this life.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.250
-And your prices are too high.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.458
No wonder no one's here.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.750
We don't open for three hours.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.291
Well, that explains it then.

16:50.916 --> 16:51.750
Actually...

16:52.500 --> 16:53.666
I do want this life.

16:54.916 --> 16:56.083
That's not the problem.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.416
I don't have enough money to pay you
to drive here.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.958
And when I say enough, I mean any.

17:01.875 --> 17:02.958
It's not a charity.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.041
I've got an idea that could work
for both of us.

17:09.958 --> 17:10.875
I'm listening.

17:12.541 --> 17:15.083
Clearly, this place needs some TLC.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.500
Is that right?

17:16.583 --> 17:20.166
So employ me to help out,
but instead of paying me...

17:20.708 --> 17:23.166
let me drive three laps of the track
for every hour I work.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.333
-What's happening right now?
-I'm thinking.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.416
One lap.

17:42.208 --> 17:43.291
And only when I say.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.750
-Three, because the track is short.
-One, because of fuel costs.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.625
Three, and didn't you hear
what I said about the track being--

17:50.708 --> 17:53.083
One. And I'm not loving this backchat.

17:53.958 --> 17:55.375
-Three.
-Two.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.291
Deal.

17:56.791 --> 17:59.208
-Would have done it for one.
-Would have agreed to three.

18:00.666 --> 18:02.291
All right, you can start now.

18:10.541 --> 18:11.375
What's this for?

18:12.083 --> 18:14.458
When the track gets dusty,
it's too slippery to race on.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.666
You're gonna spray it with water
to keep it intact.

18:17.666 --> 18:20.125
You want me to spray the whole track
using this?

18:20.208 --> 18:21.041
Indeed I do.

18:21.916 --> 18:24.041
Why don't we use
that enormous water truck?

18:24.333 --> 18:28.000
I trust this backchat won't be
an ongoing feature of our conversation.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.958
Make sure you spray evenly.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.500
And one more thing.

18:32.416 --> 18:35.416
Do not enter my caravan
without an invitation.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.583
Ever. You understand?

18:38.541 --> 18:39.375
Yep.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.625
Hey. I googled you last night.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.541
It said you used to race cars.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.083
Won some big stuff.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.166
Less talking, more spraying.

18:48.250 --> 18:51.083
Get to it. You're burning sunlight.
Chop chop.

19:18.416 --> 19:19.250
Whoa!

19:21.541 --> 19:23.250
Hey, <i>Mamasita.</i>

19:23.916 --> 19:24.875
-Is that for me?
-Mm-hmm.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.166
Oh, thank you.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.250
Mmm!

19:28.666 --> 19:29.708
Oh, that's good stuff.

19:30.958 --> 19:31.958
Yeah, that's good.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.375
So I, um...

19:33.875 --> 19:34.916
I got a job today.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.625
-Really?
-Yeah. At that kart place.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.250
Oh, well done, you. That's great.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.416
Not seeing a water sprayer.

19:40.666 --> 19:41.791
This mean I get to drive?

19:47.250 --> 19:48.666
I can't drive with this thing on.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.958
You've got until sunset
to paint the garage with it.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.291
Dude!

19:54.166 --> 19:55.666
-Is this a joke?
-No backchat.

19:56.416 --> 19:59.375
Get to it. You're burning sunlight.
Chop chop.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.500
And don't call me "dude."

20:15.083 --> 20:16.708
"You're burning sunlight."

20:17.416 --> 20:19.166
Really, Mr. Miyagi?

20:19.791 --> 20:20.625
Well...

20:21.166 --> 20:22.875
why don't you shove this helmet...

20:23.416 --> 20:24.958
where there is no sunlight?

20:36.958 --> 20:38.375
Yes!

20:39.125 --> 20:40.541
-Finally.
- Good.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.291
Now do the inside.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.666
That's right. Slow down, mate.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.083
Hi, Barry.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.833
Does this mean I get to drive?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.125
I need you to wash all these.

20:56.583 --> 20:57.458
And...

20:58.458 --> 20:59.791
you're gonna do it with your feet.

20:59.875 --> 21:00.875
My feet?

21:01.750 --> 21:02.625
Your feet.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.500
You know that's super weird, right?

21:05.583 --> 21:06.541
No backchat.

21:07.083 --> 21:10.541
Get to it. You're burning sunlight.
Chop chop.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.583

21:46.333 --> 21:49.166
Can't you offset the top from the center
and add more caster?

21:52.375 --> 21:53.458
I know it's unconventional,

21:53.541 --> 21:56.833
but if you tune it right, it's worth
at least a tenth of a second a lap.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.625
Really? Is that what you reckon?

22:02.291 --> 22:04.875
If that were true,
then why aren't other teams doing it?

22:05.375 --> 22:06.875
'Cause they lack imagination?

22:07.708 --> 22:09.208
I think we'll stick with what we know.

22:09.583 --> 22:10.875
It's worked so far.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.291
Leroy wouldn't know a fast kart
if it was stapled to--

22:18.375 --> 22:19.208
Hey.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.625
He has 20 years of experience.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.125
And he's still wrong. Amazing.

22:26.541 --> 22:29.625
Put me in charge of the kart.
I'll be a better chief engineer.

22:32.708 --> 22:34.625
Sweetheart, you know it's not that simple.

22:35.541 --> 22:37.583
How am I gonna learn if I never do it?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.666
Maybe you'll get your chance one day.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.958
But right now we all need to focus
on our jobs

22:43.041 --> 22:44.458
so your brother wins Nationals.

23:45.416 --> 23:46.750
I need to do some driving, man.

23:48.416 --> 23:50.083
Regional championships are next week.

23:50.666 --> 23:51.541
Regionals?

23:51.833 --> 23:52.750
No.

23:53.541 --> 23:55.916
You've got a lot of work to do
before you're ready to race.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Then why am I spraying the track?

23:58.791 --> 24:00.791
Or painting the walls with my head?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.500
I need to do some driving.

24:03.250 --> 24:04.916
And you owe me 100 laps.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.916
You'll drive when I say so.

24:07.458 --> 24:08.291
All right?

24:08.875 --> 24:09.875
We have a deal.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.416
Well, I'm canceling it.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.666
You can't cancel it, it's a deal.

24:17.625 --> 24:19.500
Hello? Is this thing on?

24:22.625 --> 24:23.791
It's canceled.

24:24.250 --> 24:25.083
Hooper out.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.375
You're not racing in Regionals.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.291
But I will let you drive.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.583
Today, all right?

24:35.958 --> 24:37.666
All 100 laps.

24:38.791 --> 24:39.625
No stops.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.500
And when you're finished...

24:42.250 --> 24:45.333
you're gonna take everything
inside that shed and put it in the bin.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.041
I'm gonna turn that into a snack bar.

24:48.666 --> 24:49.500
Deal?

24:50.208 --> 24:51.166
Yeah.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.208
-Yes?
-Yes!

24:52.291 --> 24:53.125
Good!

24:55.333 --> 24:56.166
Get to it.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.166
-You're burning sunlight-- Chop--
-Yeah, sunlight, I know. Chop chop.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.458
Woo!

25:10.000 --> 25:10.833
Woo!

25:41.250 --> 25:42.291
Woo-hoo-hoo!

26:40.375 --> 26:42.333
Looks like one of the Transformers
threw up.

26:43.208 --> 26:44.208
Yep.

26:44.291 --> 26:45.833
Know much about mechanical stuff?

26:48.000 --> 26:48.916
Me neither.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.833
So, what do we do?

26:53.875 --> 26:54.875
I've got an idea.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.458
- Hey.

27:09.625 --> 27:10.458
What?

27:11.125 --> 27:12.416
Wait! It's Jack!

27:12.916 --> 27:15.291
Man, you scared the hell out of me.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.750
Why are you leaping out of shadows?

27:17.833 --> 27:19.333
-You couldn't see me?
-They're shadows!

27:19.416 --> 27:20.958
Of course I couldn't see you!

27:21.708 --> 27:22.916
What are you doing here?

27:23.750 --> 27:25.916
Can you help me get my kart ready
to race at Regionals?

27:27.416 --> 27:28.750
And I don't have any money.

27:29.583 --> 27:30.583
So I can't pay you.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.666
In fact...

27:33.916 --> 27:35.625
it could end up costing you money.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.083
So what do you say?

27:39.041 --> 27:40.791
Well, since you put it like that...

27:43.041 --> 27:44.583
Why are you asking <i>me?</i>

27:45.416 --> 27:47.583
Well, I don't know anything about karts.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.625
And I don't know anyone who does,

27:49.708 --> 27:50.625
except for you.

27:51.916 --> 27:54.833
So you're asking me
because you didn't have any other choices?

27:54.916 --> 27:55.750
Absolutely.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.958
And that I think you'd do a good job.

28:00.291 --> 28:02.791
-I'll do it, but with one stipulation.
-Okay.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.833
I'm chief engineer.
That means I'm in charge of the kart.

28:06.458 --> 28:07.291
Deal.

28:08.583 --> 28:09.458
See you tomorrow?

28:09.958 --> 28:10.875
We'll see!

28:12.083 --> 28:12.916
Cool.

28:15.291 --> 28:16.125
Woo!

28:20.500 --> 28:23.083
You want to race <i>this</i>
at Regionals?

28:24.250 --> 28:26.333
It looks like it was hit by a truck.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.000
Can you fix it?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.958
Was it hit by a truck?

28:31.916 --> 28:33.125
That's the way we found it.

28:35.625 --> 28:36.583
I can fix it.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.916
Let's start by sorting everything.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Put the engine parts there,
the brake parts there,

28:41.083 --> 28:43.708
the steering parts here,
and the exhaust parts here.

28:48.125 --> 28:50.250
Clearly, we need to start from basics.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.833
Okay, listen closely.
There'll be an exam afterwards.

28:52.916 --> 28:55.083
-That's an axle--
- Uh, Mandy?

28:57.250 --> 28:58.125
Yes, Colin?

28:58.833 --> 29:00.500
Will there really be an exam?

29:02.208 --> 29:05.583
No, Colin.
That's the axle. This is the brake disc.

29:05.666 --> 29:07.625
-She's so cool.
-That's the brake caliper...

29:07.708 --> 29:09.541
-I'm just happy there isn't an exam.
-Yeah.

29:24.333 --> 29:25.166
It's so...

29:25.875 --> 29:26.708
ugly.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.291
It's not ugly.

29:28.916 --> 29:30.000
You know what's ugly?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
Slow. And this ain't slow.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.583
So where do we test drive it?

29:36.833 --> 29:38.916
Are you sure
we're meant to be driving on this?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.416
Sometimes you don't ask
for permission, Col.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.291
You just do it and apologize later.

29:43.375 --> 29:46.625
Now, this is a test drive,
so take it slow.

29:46.708 --> 29:47.541
I hear you.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.708
I don't think he heard you.

30:06.750 --> 30:07.583
Idiot!

30:16.958 --> 30:18.666
Woo-hoo!

30:24.625 --> 30:25.833
Woo!

30:32.833 --> 30:33.708
Woo!

30:50.208 --> 30:52.750
Well, gentlemen, it's been real.

30:53.625 --> 30:55.833
-See you at the track tomorrow?
-Yeah...

30:56.916 --> 30:59.041
about that. This was a one-off.

30:59.750 --> 31:02.125
If my dad finds out
I helped a rival team...

31:02.750 --> 31:04.666
he'll go off like a frog in a sock.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.375
-Thanks.
-No worries.

31:12.458 --> 31:15.000
Don't go on the outside of the track
like you did at my party.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.500
If you get on the marbles,
you will slide off.

31:29.041 --> 31:30.958
Hey, what if we get you a funnel?

31:31.041 --> 31:33.291
That'd be faster.
Then I could just pour it right in there.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.958
Are you working at that kart place today?

31:38.041 --> 31:39.291
Um, no.

31:39.791 --> 31:40.916
Today's my first race.

31:42.791 --> 31:44.416
Oh, really?

31:44.500 --> 31:45.333
-Right.
-Yeah.

31:45.916 --> 31:46.750
First race.

31:48.333 --> 31:49.500
Well, that's cool.

31:50.666 --> 31:52.291
I'll get Colin to FaceTime you.

31:54.333 --> 31:55.583
He'll FaceTime me?

31:56.083 --> 31:57.000
Yeah.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.291
Just answer the call.

31:58.791 --> 31:59.791
Race starts at 11:00.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.125
-Wish me luck.
-Luck.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.166
-Bye.
-Have fun!

32:27.291 --> 32:28.125
Hey.

32:28.708 --> 32:29.541
Out of the way.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.833
You know you can't let them
treat you like that.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.708
I know.
I just don't know what to do about it.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.625
You want to go home?

32:41.375 --> 32:44.125
No way.
I don't want to miss out on an adventure.

32:45.541 --> 32:46.500
Yeah, mate.

32:46.583 --> 32:48.166
<i>After the KA3 qualifying session,</i>

32:48.250 --> 32:51.750
title favorite Dean Zeta
is in first place!

32:51.833 --> 32:55.583
<i>In second is Jess Hoyt,</i>
<i>with Juliet Kay a solid third.</i>

32:55.666 --> 32:57.875
<i>Top three finishers in the upcoming final</i>

32:57.958 --> 33:00.375
<i>move straight through</i>
<i>to the State Championships.</i>

33:03.333 --> 33:06.208
I attack until I lead.
I take no prisoners.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.625
I never concede.

33:07.708 --> 33:10.791
Whoever said winning isn't everything
is a fool who knows nothing.

33:10.875 --> 33:11.958
I am unbeatable.

33:14.041 --> 33:15.041
Go do your thing.

33:24.083 --> 33:25.958
<i>This race is in the KA3 class.</i>

33:26.041 --> 33:27.125
<i>And just a reminder,</i>

33:27.208 --> 33:30.541
the top three finishers go straight
through to the State Championship.

33:34.708 --> 33:35.833
Come on, Jack.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.833
It's my son's first race today.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.541
-Oh, how nice.
-Yeah.

33:40.625 --> 33:42.916
<i>Okay, here they come, folks, in formation.</i>
<i>Two by two.</i>

33:43.500 --> 33:46.083
<i>We're getting set for a start.</i>
<i>Green light's on.</i>

33:46.875 --> 33:48.541
<i>We're off and racing, folks!</i>

33:50.458 --> 33:53.791
<i>Oh! That was a lunge, with a capital L!</i>

33:53.875 --> 33:56.583
<i>Dean Zeta takes the lead,</i>
<i>and he's streaking away.</i>

34:18.041 --> 34:20.458
<i>And young Hooper now thunders through</i>
<i>into tenth place.</i>

34:20.541 --> 34:22.875
<i>-He's inside, he's outside.</i>
-That's good.

34:22.958 --> 34:25.375
<i>He is wearing this go-kart</i>
<i>like an old suit!</i>

34:25.875 --> 34:27.375
They're quite zippy, aren't they?

34:27.916 --> 34:28.875
Is it safe?

34:28.958 --> 34:30.125
Well, they're wearing helmets.

34:34.791 --> 34:35.708
<i>Into ninth.</i>

34:35.791 --> 34:37.291
<i>From ninth to eighth.</i>

34:37.375 --> 34:41.750
<i>He's going after the champagne,</i>
<i>the glory, and the gold!</i>

34:43.291 --> 34:45.458
<i>Come on, Hooper! You can do it, son!</i>

34:56.333 --> 34:57.541
<i>He's moving up into fifth.</i>

34:57.625 --> 34:59.416
<i>-Oh, this is sensational.</i>
-Keep going.

35:04.250 --> 35:05.416
Yes, Dean! Yes!

35:23.000 --> 35:25.083
<i>He uses the whole of the track.</i>

35:26.666 --> 35:28.916
<i>He's got his eyes on first place for sure.</i>

35:31.458 --> 35:33.875
<i>-Jack Hooper takes fourth.</i>
-Come on, get out of the way!

35:36.958 --> 35:38.416
<i>Show no fear, mate.</i>

35:38.500 --> 35:41.041
<i>Don't go on the outside</i>
<i>of the track. You will slide off.</i>

36:04.583 --> 36:05.458
Yeah!

36:05.541 --> 36:06.375
<i>Dean Zeta, first.</i>

36:07.916 --> 36:09.083
<i>Jack Hooper, third.</i>

36:09.166 --> 36:10.083
Come on, Dean! Go!

36:20.916 --> 36:22.458
What the hell are you doing?

36:22.708 --> 36:25.333
-Coming third in my first race.
-But I told you you weren't ready.

36:25.416 --> 36:28.125
Which you just proved
by making that reckless overtake.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.250
That overtake got me through to States.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.958
Yeah. It could have put you in a coffin.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.083
But it didn't.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.666
You should congratulate me.

36:35.666 --> 36:36.708
Where did this come from?

36:39.125 --> 36:40.250
The back of your shed.

36:42.083 --> 36:43.000
Not bad work.

36:43.625 --> 36:44.458
Did you do it?

36:46.041 --> 36:47.750
I had a lot of help from my mates.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.541
And I... I need help from you too.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.083
Will you be my coach?

36:55.583 --> 36:57.375
-When I say coach,

36:57.458 --> 37:00.625
I mean teach me everything
I need to know about driving.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.916
I don't wanna be doing
any more of this spraying

37:04.000 --> 37:06.291
or painting or cleaning with my feet.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.875
All of that was to improve your fitness.
All right?

37:08.958 --> 37:11.791
The spraying develops your arms,
so they don't get tired when you steer.

37:11.875 --> 37:15.375
The painting strengthens your neck, so you
can handle the G-forces when you corner.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.250
The cleaning improves
your ankles' flexibility,

37:17.333 --> 37:18.666
so you can work the pedals faster.

37:20.250 --> 37:21.083
See?

37:21.166 --> 37:23.625
This is exactly
why I need you to be my coach.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.125
-Are you thinking again?
-Yes.

37:36.666 --> 37:37.875
All right, listen to me.

37:39.041 --> 37:43.541
I will coach you,
but you are gonna do everything I say.

37:43.625 --> 37:44.875
Do you understand?

37:44.958 --> 37:46.083
No backchat.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.791
Okay. No backchat.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.208
Nice suit, by the way.

38:02.666 --> 38:05.458
Oh, those corn are great, by the way.
You're gonna love it.

38:06.208 --> 38:07.875
-Thanks, guys. See ya.
-Thank you.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.291
Mmm.

38:32.708 --> 38:33.583
Mmm.

38:39.125 --> 38:40.541
No, no, no, no, no.

38:41.625 --> 38:42.583
Hi, Barry!

38:43.458 --> 38:44.375
He did not.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.750
Not on my watch.

38:59.375 --> 39:00.416
Jack...

39:01.041 --> 39:04.666
I'm gonna get you to pull over
and, uh, turn off your ignition, please.

39:06.708 --> 39:09.833
<i>Your mother is going to be</i>
<i>very disappointed.</i>

39:11.125 --> 39:11.958
<i>Jack?</i>

39:15.291 --> 39:16.125
Hello?

39:17.666 --> 39:18.833
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

39:20.916 --> 39:23.625
<i>I'm ordering you to stop the vehicle.</i>

39:24.375 --> 39:26.166
<i>Please. Thank you.</i>

39:40.416 --> 39:42.750
What on earth do you think
you're doing, mate?

39:42.833 --> 39:44.208
I need you

39:44.291 --> 39:46.250
to ask my mother out on a date.

39:47.833 --> 39:48.708
What?

39:51.083 --> 39:53.583
-And why would I want to do that?
-Because you like her.

39:54.333 --> 39:56.333
Excuse me? I don't...

39:56.416 --> 39:57.875
This... You...

39:58.791 --> 39:59.791
You...

39:59.875 --> 40:02.958
I hope your conversation skills
are better than this on the date.

40:03.041 --> 40:06.250
There isn't gonna be any date, mate.

40:06.333 --> 40:08.458
-Why not?
-What makes you even think I like her?

40:08.541 --> 40:10.250
Well, you haven't arrested me.

40:10.791 --> 40:12.041
The night is young.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.875
Ha! See? There it is.

40:13.958 --> 40:16.208
That's the type of cheeky banter
my mother loves.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.708
Why are you asking me to do this?

40:18.791 --> 40:21.500
You're a cop,
so you're probably not a criminal.

40:23.041 --> 40:25.791
And you're not wearing a wedding ring.
You are single, right?

40:26.750 --> 40:27.875
-Yes.
-Good.

40:28.375 --> 40:30.291
And I'm guessing
your dad's out of the picture.

40:30.375 --> 40:31.250
Yeah.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.625
So, uh, what do you reckon?

40:35.666 --> 40:36.583
The thing is...

40:38.666 --> 40:41.041
when I talk to women socially,

40:41.125 --> 40:43.916
I have been known to freeze up
from time to time.

40:44.000 --> 40:44.833
Okay.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.750
-Make that all of the time.
-Okay, well...

40:49.833 --> 40:51.000
that ends today, Barry.

40:52.625 --> 40:53.458
She's inside.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.625
Take a moment
to come up with an opening line.

40:57.125 --> 40:57.958
All right.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.291
Okay.

41:01.791 --> 41:02.958
-Got it.
-Good.

41:03.541 --> 41:04.541
Try it on me. Go.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.125
Hey, Christie.

41:07.708 --> 41:09.833
Would you like
to go out to dinner with me?

41:10.416 --> 41:11.666
Next week, perhaps?

41:12.625 --> 41:14.916
Why do you have an accent all of a sudden?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.416
-I don't have an accent.
-You do!

41:17.000 --> 41:19.291
Okay, let's try it again.
One more time, yeah?

41:19.375 --> 41:20.291
Okay. All right.

41:21.583 --> 41:22.416
Hey, Christie.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.500
Would you like
to go out to dinner with me sometime?

41:25.583 --> 41:26.666
Sometime next week?

41:28.541 --> 41:29.416
That was pretty good.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.333
-It was adequate.
-That was all right.

41:31.416 --> 41:32.375
All right. Come on.

41:33.000 --> 41:33.833
Okay.

41:36.000 --> 41:36.833
Good luck.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.083
Ahem.

41:44.916 --> 41:46.458
-Officer Johansen.
-Hey.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.083
Uh, is everything okay?

41:49.916 --> 41:51.291
Everything's cool-magool.

41:55.833 --> 41:56.666
Yeah.

41:58.041 --> 41:59.041
Um...

41:59.125 --> 42:00.583
Can I help you with anything?

42:01.250 --> 42:02.083
Yes.

42:02.958 --> 42:04.458
Christie, I was, um...

42:07.208 --> 42:09.416
Christie, I was wondering if you'd, uh...

42:11.125 --> 42:14.166
like to go out to dinner with me
sometime... next week.

42:15.416 --> 42:16.250
Perhaps.

42:20.375 --> 42:21.583
Yeah. That'd be lovely.

42:23.250 --> 42:24.416
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:26.625 --> 42:27.583
That's great!

42:28.375 --> 42:29.250
That's great.

42:29.666 --> 42:30.583
Um...

42:31.125 --> 42:32.083
I'll be in touch.

42:32.833 --> 42:33.666
Oh, okay.

42:34.625 --> 42:36.500
There we are.

42:36.916 --> 42:37.958
Uh...

42:38.041 --> 42:38.875
Bye.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.416
So, Regionals went well.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.666
Didn't need to make those changes
to the kart after all.

42:53.833 --> 42:54.750
I guess.

42:56.125 --> 42:57.000
"I guess"?

42:57.750 --> 42:58.875
What's that supposed to mean?

43:00.541 --> 43:02.083
The kart was fast. I won.

43:02.583 --> 43:04.166
Your changes weren't necessary.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.291
I'm just being honest.

43:07.916 --> 43:09.208
Don't take it personally.

43:11.916 --> 43:14.500
If your kart was fast,
you would have pulled away.

43:15.041 --> 43:16.708
But you won by half a length.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.458
If you started anywhere but the front,
you would have lost.

43:22.708 --> 43:23.875
I'm just being honest.

43:24.375 --> 43:25.875
Don't take it personally.

43:32.916 --> 43:33.750
Hey.

43:34.500 --> 43:35.333
Hi.

43:40.416 --> 43:42.000
I've been asked out on a date.

43:42.500 --> 43:43.791
-Really?
-Yeah.

43:44.375 --> 43:45.250
That's cool.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.958
I don't know what you did, but...

43:50.625 --> 43:51.458
thank you.

43:51.541 --> 43:54.000
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

43:58.416 --> 44:00.833
You know you don't have to fix everything,
right?

44:01.416 --> 44:03.541
You don't always have to be
the strong one.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.375
It's okay if you want to, you know...

44:07.833 --> 44:09.000
show some emotion.

44:11.833 --> 44:12.666
That one.

44:20.291 --> 44:21.125
Hey, Barry.

44:26.291 --> 44:27.458
Welcome to race school.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.375
-What's that for?

44:29.958 --> 44:32.833
Backchat.
It will also be used as a teaching aid.

44:34.041 --> 44:35.541
-It's really quite loud.

44:37.000 --> 44:37.833
Now get in.

44:41.125 --> 44:41.958
Sorry.

44:42.458 --> 44:43.541
Act like I'm not here.

44:46.875 --> 44:48.125
Place your hands on the wheel.

44:51.708 --> 44:52.791
Wrong.

44:52.875 --> 44:56.416
The correct position is nine o'clock
and three o'clock.

45:03.166 --> 45:05.000
-It doesn't feel natural--

45:05.500 --> 45:07.750
You'll always know
which way your front wheels are pointing

45:07.833 --> 45:10.166
if your hands mirror their position
on the steering wheel.

45:10.750 --> 45:11.875
Easy breezy.

45:12.583 --> 45:13.666
Easy breezy.

45:23.083 --> 45:26.333
When the wheel's turned,
a string will be tied on the accelerator.

45:26.416 --> 45:28.416
You won't be able to press it
without snapping it.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.625
But as the wheel straightens...

45:31.333 --> 45:32.958
it'll start to give you some slack.

45:33.708 --> 45:34.958
You can floor it.

45:36.208 --> 45:37.041
Ugh!

45:37.125 --> 45:39.166
I want you to drive as fast as you can.

45:39.666 --> 45:41.791
But you don't snap the string.

45:41.875 --> 45:44.833
You keep your hands at nine and three
at all times.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.833
Aah!

45:48.541 --> 45:49.375
Whoa.

45:50.583 --> 45:51.416
I'm all right.

45:56.916 --> 45:58.125
Easy into the corner.

46:01.916 --> 46:03.583
-Nine and three!

46:05.708 --> 46:06.875
Wait till we exit.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.333
Nine and three.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.000
- Too soon.

46:14.916 --> 46:17.416
You've got to find
that balance between the accelerator

46:17.500 --> 46:18.416
and the steering wheel.

46:19.125 --> 46:19.958
Yes?

46:21.833 --> 46:23.333
-Nine and three!

46:25.750 --> 46:26.833
Keep the balance.

46:28.583 --> 46:31.500
Not so easy breezy now, is it? Huh?

46:50.166 --> 46:51.458
All right, that'll do.

46:54.125 --> 46:54.958
Right.

46:55.375 --> 46:56.541
Same time tomorrow.

46:58.333 --> 47:00.500
Hey. What if the race line is blocked?

47:01.166 --> 47:03.083
I mean, how do I get past?

47:04.541 --> 47:07.166
Well, each situation's different,
so there's no right answer.

47:09.250 --> 47:11.625
But I like to apply
the rules of the overtake.

47:13.041 --> 47:14.041
Be patient,

47:15.250 --> 47:17.625
analyze what each driver is doing,

47:17.708 --> 47:20.000
and take advantage of any mistake.

47:22.666 --> 47:23.791
What's going on?

47:24.916 --> 47:26.041
I wasn't very good today.

47:28.583 --> 47:31.041
Feeling sorry for yourself
isn't gonna make you a better driver,

47:31.125 --> 47:33.125
it's just gonna make you
annoying to be around.

47:33.208 --> 47:34.916
Yeah, but it pisses me off.

47:35.000 --> 47:35.833
Good.

47:35.916 --> 47:36.750
Use it.

47:39.125 --> 47:39.958
Hey.

47:40.041 --> 47:41.208
When I googled you,

47:41.291 --> 47:44.166
it said that you retired from racing
in the middle of the season.

47:47.791 --> 47:48.666
Hey, Mandy.

47:49.583 --> 47:50.833
She never says hi to us.

47:59.208 --> 48:00.791
Accelerate out of the apex.

48:06.958 --> 48:09.458
Remember your balance here.
Take a tighter line.

48:34.708 --> 48:36.083
Okay, pull it up here.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.000
How was that?

48:45.375 --> 48:47.000
Oh, my God. A smile!

48:47.708 --> 48:49.333
That's the first time
I've seen your teeth.

48:49.416 --> 48:50.750
All right, don't get cocky.

48:51.625 --> 48:53.083
You've got a long road ahead of you.

48:54.625 --> 48:57.875
You've got to prepare your kart for State.
Your friends are gonna help again?

48:57.958 --> 48:58.833
I'm in!

49:02.250 --> 49:03.875
Is he the one who made it quick?

49:03.958 --> 49:06.125
He just found out
the engine runs on petrol.

49:06.916 --> 49:08.625
We need the one who made it quick.

49:22.625 --> 49:24.083
-Hey, Mandy?

49:24.666 --> 49:25.500
What?

49:26.583 --> 49:27.708
Are you serious?

49:27.791 --> 49:28.833
You did it again.

49:28.916 --> 49:30.166
You really couldn't see me?

49:30.666 --> 49:33.208
We've been over this. They're shadows.

49:33.875 --> 49:35.083
What are you doing here?

49:35.875 --> 49:37.000
I wanted to thank you.

49:38.291 --> 49:40.291
I wouldn't have made it through to State
without you.

49:41.750 --> 49:42.583
I know.

49:43.291 --> 49:44.250
Can you make it quicker?

49:46.166 --> 49:47.541
I don't know if I want to.

49:48.291 --> 49:51.166
-Why?
-Because you didn't listen to me.

49:51.250 --> 49:53.125
I told you not to go
on the outside of the track,

49:53.208 --> 49:54.583
and that's exactly what you did.

49:54.666 --> 49:56.208
The inside was blocked.

49:56.291 --> 49:58.416
The inside is always blocked.

49:58.916 --> 50:01.000
The trick is to find a way to unblock it.

50:01.958 --> 50:02.791
See?

50:04.041 --> 50:05.583
I need to know this stuff.

50:07.625 --> 50:09.541
You only say that
because you want me to help you.

50:09.625 --> 50:10.541
Absolutely.

50:11.125 --> 50:12.916
That doesn't mean it's not true.

50:14.458 --> 50:15.291
Will you do it?

50:16.250 --> 50:17.208
I don't know.

50:22.333 --> 50:24.333
I'll take that as a definite maybe.

50:33.333 --> 50:35.041
Is this all your handiwork, Jack?

50:35.791 --> 50:36.750
That's pretty good.

50:38.625 --> 50:39.750
I thank you.

50:40.833 --> 50:42.916
You're working with Mike Zeta's daughter?

50:44.416 --> 50:47.166
Yeah, and he can't find out
I'm doing this.

50:47.833 --> 50:49.208
This is not gonna happen.

50:49.625 --> 50:51.750
All in favor
of Mandy being chief engineer?

50:57.500 --> 50:58.333
Carried.

51:01.625 --> 51:03.750
You said you wanted
the one who made it quick.

51:14.875 --> 51:15.833
Hey, I, um...

51:16.875 --> 51:18.625
I really appreciate you helping me out.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.541
No worries.

51:20.625 --> 51:22.458
I want to say thank you by...

51:23.083 --> 51:23.958
uh...

51:24.041 --> 51:25.083
asking you out.

51:27.291 --> 51:28.250
That'd be lovely.

51:33.708 --> 51:35.416
Right, well...

51:36.625 --> 51:37.708
This is awkward.

51:38.333 --> 51:39.250
Yep.

51:39.333 --> 51:41.208
I'll go see if Patrick
needs anything.

51:41.875 --> 51:42.791
Anyway...

51:44.000 --> 51:47.875
I thought it'd be cool to see
what you guys do for fun-ness around here.

51:51.541 --> 51:52.791
Does that smile mean yes?

51:56.541 --> 51:57.458
It means...

51:58.583 --> 52:01.166
I'll meet you at the Rollerdrome
tomorrow at six.

52:05.166 --> 52:06.000
Cool.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.833
Yeah.

52:08.916 --> 52:10.500
- Patrick?

52:11.958 --> 52:13.750
Hello? I'm off.

52:38.166 --> 52:39.625
Oh, cool.

52:52.750 --> 52:53.875
What the hell are you doing?

52:54.041 --> 52:55.208
Uh... um...

52:55.875 --> 52:57.583
I had to drop off your keys.

52:58.583 --> 53:02.625
Right, and somehow break
a $150 Thomastik-Infeld D string.

53:02.708 --> 53:03.583
I'm sorry.

53:04.291 --> 53:05.125
Get out.

53:08.083 --> 53:09.041
Whoa!

53:10.250 --> 53:11.166
That's so cool.

53:11.708 --> 53:12.583
Get out!

53:13.625 --> 53:14.458
Okay.

53:16.208 --> 53:17.500
Oh, my God!

53:19.541 --> 53:20.541
You're so young.

53:21.291 --> 53:22.166
Who's your mate?

53:23.750 --> 53:24.583
Nobody.

53:25.208 --> 53:26.041
Out.

53:57.416 --> 53:58.416
G'day, Barry.

53:59.625 --> 54:00.666
Everything okay?

54:01.416 --> 54:02.583
Yeah, of course.

54:04.250 --> 54:05.958
Uh, no, not really.

54:07.291 --> 54:11.000
Thing is, I've got a date
with your mother tonight.

54:11.083 --> 54:12.250
-Yeah?
-And...

54:12.833 --> 54:15.208
I've come to realize
that I don't know what she likes.

54:15.708 --> 54:17.375
So I need some advice.

54:18.541 --> 54:19.416
For example...

54:20.125 --> 54:21.541
what does she actually like?

54:22.541 --> 54:23.458
Uh...

54:25.458 --> 54:27.541
The music of Daryl Braithwaite.

54:27.625 --> 54:28.833
Just give me a second, mate.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.333
Braithwaite.

54:33.041 --> 54:33.875
Yeah.

54:34.416 --> 54:35.333
Um...

54:36.958 --> 54:38.208
Chinese food.

54:38.708 --> 54:39.583
Chinese.

54:40.375 --> 54:41.500
And, um...

54:44.041 --> 54:45.333
Steve Carell movies?

54:45.416 --> 54:47.208
I really did like <i>40-Year-Old Virgin.</i>

54:50.000 --> 54:50.916
I'm just...

54:51.000 --> 54:52.791
I'm afraid she's gonna think
I'm really boring.

54:52.875 --> 54:53.750
Then don't be.

54:55.291 --> 54:58.750
Look, don't talk about yourself too much.
Ask questions.

54:59.458 --> 55:00.875
Listen to the answers.

55:01.583 --> 55:03.208
-Listen.
-Make jokes.

55:03.291 --> 55:05.291
-Jokes.
-Have fun.

55:06.166 --> 55:07.166
-Fun.
-Yeah.

55:08.000 --> 55:08.833
That's gold.

55:09.541 --> 55:11.666
-Where'd you get all this stuff?
-My dad.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.083
Well, he was a very wise man.

55:16.166 --> 55:17.083
Catch you later.

55:40.708 --> 55:41.541
Wow.

55:43.041 --> 55:44.291
You look so lovely and...

55:45.458 --> 55:46.291
clean.

55:48.416 --> 55:50.583
Did you say, "Lovely and clean"?

55:52.458 --> 55:54.750
I mean, most of the time,
you're covered in grease.

55:54.833 --> 55:56.375
You should stop talking now.

55:56.458 --> 55:58.041
Yeah. Yeah.

55:58.125 --> 55:58.958
Coming up!

56:08.500 --> 56:09.791
Well, we tried.

56:12.250 --> 56:13.375
I've got an idea.

56:20.708 --> 56:21.708
Humongous Claw!

56:24.250 --> 56:25.458
You didn't have an idea.

56:25.541 --> 56:27.833
You just looked around,
saw the Humongous Claw,

56:27.916 --> 56:29.916
and shouted, "The Humongous Claw!"

56:31.375 --> 56:32.291
Absolutely.

56:34.250 --> 56:35.958
That doesn't mean it's not fun.

56:36.583 --> 56:37.416
Hey? I mean...

56:38.125 --> 56:39.625
it's a claw that's humongous.

56:42.708 --> 56:43.708
Please give it a go.

56:45.625 --> 56:46.458
Please.

56:53.750 --> 56:56.875
Hey, do you wanna go and see
the new Steve Carell movie tonight?

56:56.958 --> 56:57.833
That'd be great.

56:57.916 --> 57:00.291
It's playing up
at the Orana Cinema.

57:00.375 --> 57:01.208
Okay.

57:01.875 --> 57:02.708
Then maybe...

57:03.250 --> 57:05.333
if you wanted to,
we could go to the Jade Temple.

57:06.375 --> 57:07.541
Get some Chinese food.

57:08.125 --> 57:09.791
Oh, yeah, I love Chinese.

57:09.875 --> 57:10.750
Yeah.

57:12.666 --> 57:17.416
♪ <i>One summer I'll find a way ♪</i>

57:18.666 --> 57:21.166
♪ <i>One summer I will-- ♪</i>

57:21.250 --> 57:22.916
Are you singing a Daryl Braithwaite song?

57:23.750 --> 57:25.541
-Yeah.

57:25.625 --> 57:26.458
I love Daryl.

57:27.166 --> 57:28.416
I'm a massive fan.

57:28.500 --> 57:29.791
-Really?
-Yeah.

57:29.875 --> 57:31.416
You like Daryl Braithwaite?

57:31.750 --> 57:32.583
Yeah.

57:35.125 --> 57:35.958
No.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.333
Not really.

57:38.291 --> 57:41.375
I've never heard of him.
Actually, that's not true.

57:42.625 --> 57:43.791
I committed it to memory.

57:43.875 --> 57:44.958
Oh, my God!

57:45.041 --> 57:46.916
-Why would you do that?
-I don't know.

57:47.541 --> 57:50.250
Someone told me that you liked him,
so I thought I'd impress you.

57:50.833 --> 57:53.291
Look, why don't we do something
that we'd both like to do?

57:53.375 --> 57:56.875
So no Steve Carell, no Daryl Braithwaite,
no Chinese restaurant,

57:56.958 --> 57:59.333
no whatever else
my son said that I'd like.

58:00.416 --> 58:01.666
Good thinking. Rightie-o.

58:02.458 --> 58:05.000
Although I'd still like Chinese food.
Do you want to do that?

58:05.083 --> 58:06.958
Oh, good. Yeah, I'm dying for a dim sim.

58:10.416 --> 58:13.583
If you finish in the top three
and you make it through to Nationals,

58:13.666 --> 58:16.375
it's my first step
towards becoming the next Leena Gade.

58:16.458 --> 58:17.541
Next who?

58:17.625 --> 58:20.125
She's the first woman
to engineer a car that won Le Mans.

58:20.791 --> 58:22.666
I want to be her but in Formula 1.

58:22.750 --> 58:23.583
Cool.

58:23.666 --> 58:25.458
Well, we'd better win then, hey?

58:25.541 --> 58:26.416
No pressure.

58:28.125 --> 58:30.541
My dad and I used to come here
when I was little.

58:31.416 --> 58:32.750
We haven't been for a while.

58:33.625 --> 58:34.625
What's your dad like?

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Uh...

58:37.875 --> 58:39.208
He died when I was 11.

58:40.708 --> 58:41.541
Cancer.

58:43.416 --> 58:46.333
Oh, man. And here I am blabbering on.

58:47.416 --> 58:48.250
It's fine.

58:50.333 --> 58:51.541
What was he like?

58:51.625 --> 58:53.125
Oh, he loved cars.

58:53.208 --> 58:56.541
We used to drive around
on the weekends in his old car.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
I really miss that.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.416
I'm sorry. This was supposed to be fun.

59:09.958 --> 59:13.416
Actually, this is the most fun-ness
I've had in a long time.

59:37.791 --> 59:40.875
You know, R2-D2 speaks perfect English
in the <i>Star Wars </i>movies,

59:40.958 --> 59:42.291
but all we hear are the beeps,

59:42.375 --> 59:44.875
because he loves
to drop the f-bomb so much.

59:49.875 --> 59:51.875
- Oh, no.
- It's ruined.

59:52.375 --> 59:53.500
Who'd do this?

59:57.583 --> 59:58.416
Them.

1:00:13.333 --> 1:00:15.375
That's my brother and his ass clown mates.

1:00:21.583 --> 1:00:22.958
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

1:00:24.041 --> 1:00:24.916
I can fix it.

1:00:26.666 --> 1:00:27.500
I don't know.

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:29.000
We can do it.

1:00:29.541 --> 1:00:31.416
State Championships are tomorrow.

1:00:31.500 --> 1:00:35.541
So? We work all night
and hit Dean where it hurts. On the track.

1:00:36.041 --> 1:00:38.500
Personally,
I'd rather hit him in the nuts, but...

1:00:39.041 --> 1:00:40.208
on the track works too.

1:00:41.458 --> 1:00:43.166
Okay. Let's get to it.

1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:06.125
We need a new brake disc.
This one is toast.

1:01:07.125 --> 1:01:08.291
So we're screwed?

1:01:12.208 --> 1:01:13.541
Not necessarily.

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:18.500
My dad won't give me anything

1:01:18.583 --> 1:01:20.541
if he finds out I'm working
with a rival team.

1:01:20.666 --> 1:01:22.166
It's our only option.

1:01:22.250 --> 1:01:24.958
Look, I'm sure you'll do great in prison,

1:01:25.041 --> 1:01:28.250
but my delicate constitution
isn't suited to a life behind bars.

1:01:28.333 --> 1:01:30.416
No one's going to prison, Colin.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:32.291
We're just gonna fix what they destroyed.

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:35.458
Now, keep your balaclavas on.
There's cameras everywhere.

1:01:36.041 --> 1:01:37.333
Okay, you're on watch.

1:01:37.416 --> 1:01:40.000
So if anyone approaches the building,
you have to let us know.

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:43.625
All right. If I see anyone coming,
I'll make a bird sound like...

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.458
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

1:01:46.083 --> 1:01:47.791
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:49.750
Okay. Let's go on three.

1:01:50.208 --> 1:01:52.708
-One, two--
-We're up to two already?

1:01:52.916 --> 1:01:53.750
Three!

1:01:55.708 --> 1:01:57.291
Okay. This isn't so bad.

1:02:12.916 --> 1:02:14.041
All right, Colin.

1:02:14.375 --> 1:02:15.208
You got this.

1:02:15.291 --> 1:02:17.166
I'll bet you're last!

1:02:17.250 --> 1:02:19.250
Here comes the ankle tap! Oh!

1:02:20.125 --> 1:02:21.250
Stupid joke, Dean.

1:02:21.333 --> 1:02:22.583
- Don't be such a baby.
-Jeez.

1:02:23.625 --> 1:02:24.583
Got it!

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:25.583
Excellent.

1:02:25.666 --> 1:02:27.708
- Dean, tell us the code.
- You're dreaming.

1:02:28.833 --> 1:02:30.458
Caw! Caw!

1:02:30.541 --> 1:02:31.500
Ca-caw!

1:02:31.583 --> 1:02:32.833
Ca-caw!

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:35.041
Quick, quick, quick! Down here!

1:02:40.583 --> 1:02:42.333
Fire up the PlayStation.
I'll get some drinks.

1:02:42.416 --> 1:02:45.333
-Shotgun player one!
-You're always player one. It's my turn.

1:02:45.416 --> 1:02:47.458
I'm player one. I'm the best.

1:02:47.541 --> 1:02:49.458
Hey, Dean. Get me a lemonade.

1:02:49.958 --> 1:02:51.500
What's with that stupid bird?

1:02:51.875 --> 1:02:54.125
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

1:02:58.333 --> 1:03:00.916
Ralph, three. Ted, nothing.
You ain't gonna stop me.

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.750
-'Cause I'm the best!
- Coming right up.

1:03:08.208 --> 1:03:10.166
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

1:03:16.291 --> 1:03:17.125
What was that?

1:03:17.625 --> 1:03:18.458
Who's there?

1:03:21.458 --> 1:03:22.791
I've never felt so alive!

1:03:27.166 --> 1:03:28.375
We stole a brake disc!

1:03:33.750 --> 1:03:34.875
You stole my heart.

1:03:36.125 --> 1:03:38.291
That's the lamest thing you've ever said.

1:03:39.916 --> 1:03:40.916
And the best.

1:03:49.375 --> 1:03:51.250
It's amazing you don't get heartburn.

1:03:54.041 --> 1:03:55.416
Sorry I can't come today.

1:03:56.500 --> 1:03:59.375
Ah, it's all right.
I'll just get Colin to FaceTime you.

1:03:59.708 --> 1:04:01.000
I like to call it FT.

1:04:03.416 --> 1:04:04.291
Okay, yeah.

1:04:04.958 --> 1:04:06.666
-I've got to go, Mum.
-Okay.

1:04:07.666 --> 1:04:09.083
-Wish me luck.
-Luck.

1:04:09.166 --> 1:04:10.000
See you soon.

1:04:10.458 --> 1:04:12.625
-Don't do that scary sliding thing.
-Don't worry, Mum.

1:04:21.791 --> 1:04:24.541
<i>You're clearly favorite</i>
<i>to take the Under-16 State Championship.</i>

1:04:24.958 --> 1:04:26.625
<i>Are you confident of a win?</i>

1:04:26.708 --> 1:04:28.875
<i>Yes, well, of course</i>
<i>I would love to win State this year.</i>

1:04:30.041 --> 1:04:33.166
<i>But, at this point in time,</i>
<i>I'm just taking it one day after the next.</i>

1:04:33.250 --> 1:04:34.500
Let me give you a tip.

1:04:35.375 --> 1:04:37.541
Everybody takes it one day after the next.

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:39.416
That's how time works.

1:04:44.375 --> 1:04:45.750
See you at the finish line.

1:04:46.333 --> 1:04:47.458
I'll be waiting for you.

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:52.916
Out of the way.

1:04:56.416 --> 1:04:58.291
Mate, you've got to stand up to him, okay?

1:04:59.291 --> 1:05:00.333
Show no fear.

1:05:04.416 --> 1:05:06.875
Hi. I'm here to register
for the Under-16s.

1:05:07.791 --> 1:05:09.875
The KA3 qualifying session ends

1:05:09.958 --> 1:05:12.500
and title favorite Dean Zeta
is in first place.

1:05:12.583 --> 1:05:13.541
<i>In second it's...</i>

1:05:13.625 --> 1:05:15.625
Aw, man. 14th?

1:05:16.208 --> 1:05:17.125
That sucks.

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:18.833
Don't worry.

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:21.250
I mean, look at these.

1:05:21.958 --> 1:05:24.083
You're gonna be a lot faster
with some new tires on.

1:05:24.625 --> 1:05:25.833
I can't afford new ones.

1:05:26.666 --> 1:05:28.541
It's a good thing I brought a set then,
isn't it?

1:05:30.416 --> 1:05:31.291
Oh, man.

1:05:32.583 --> 1:05:33.666
Thanks.

1:05:33.750 --> 1:05:35.416
-Really, thank you. This--
-Yeah, all right.

1:05:36.125 --> 1:05:37.291
Just focus on the race.

1:05:37.875 --> 1:05:39.375
Remember the rules of the overtake.

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:40.958
Be patient.

1:05:41.375 --> 1:05:43.458
Analyze what the other drivers are doing.

1:05:43.541 --> 1:05:45.333
Take advantage of any mistake.

1:05:45.958 --> 1:05:47.250
And dance like nobody's watching.

1:05:48.291 --> 1:05:49.625
There's no dancing.

1:05:50.416 --> 1:05:52.125
But yeah. Good.

1:05:52.208 --> 1:05:53.083
Okay.

1:05:56.666 --> 1:05:57.625
What?

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:00.458
Aren't you gonna give me
a motivational speech?

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:01.958
Didn't I just do that?

1:06:03.500 --> 1:06:07.666
I mean something rousingly inspirational
about never giving up,

1:06:07.750 --> 1:06:10.583
and doing your best,
and the eye of the tiger and all that?

1:06:11.916 --> 1:06:12.750
Oh, yeah.

1:06:13.750 --> 1:06:16.708
I mean, I could do all that.
It would feel a bit forced now.

1:06:17.250 --> 1:06:19.166
I mean, that stuff's
got to be spontaneous.

1:06:19.958 --> 1:06:24.125
I attack until I lead.
I take no prisoners. I never concede.

1:06:24.208 --> 1:06:27.458
Whoever said winning isn't everything
is a fool who knows nothing.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:29.208
I am unbeatable.

1:06:47.958 --> 1:06:49.500
<i>And they're racing!</i>

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:55.500
<i>Okay, kart racers,</i>

1:06:55.583 --> 1:06:57.291
let's see how fast you really are.

1:06:57.375 --> 1:06:58.666
After 20 laps of racing,

1:06:58.750 --> 1:07:01.625
the top three finishers will advance
to the National finals.

1:07:02.333 --> 1:07:04.583
<i>Dean Zeta leads with daylight second.</i>

1:07:17.916 --> 1:07:21.500
<i>They're traveling at 100 km an hour</i>
<i>a few millimeters above the ground.</i>

1:07:25.375 --> 1:07:27.041
<i>You make your own luck in a kart.</i>

1:07:28.541 --> 1:07:30.791
<i>And Jack Hooper slices through the field.</i>

1:07:46.583 --> 1:07:49.375
<i>Jack Hooper has a monster lunge</i>
<i>down the back straight</i>

1:07:49.458 --> 1:07:51.041
<i>and picks up three places!</i>

1:08:08.208 --> 1:08:10.916
<i>Storming performance</i>
<i>from the new boy from Busselton.</i>

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.833
He's hugging the inside of the track
like it's his favorite granny.

1:08:25.166 --> 1:08:27.125
Remember the rules of the overtake.

1:08:28.541 --> 1:08:29.375
Be patient.

1:08:31.791 --> 1:08:33.875
Analyze what the other drivers are doing.

1:08:35.750 --> 1:08:37.666
Take advantage of any mistake.

1:08:44.666 --> 1:08:46.375
<i>Hooper picks up another place.</i>

1:08:52.833 --> 1:08:55.791
The top three can cruise home from here,
and they'll be through to the Nationals.

1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:03.000
<i>Hooper throws one up the inside</i>
<i>and steals it.</i>

1:09:04.416 --> 1:09:05.833
I'm coming for you, dude man.

1:09:05.916 --> 1:09:10.166
<i>A beautifully-constructed pass,</i>
<i>but also completely unnecessary.</i>

1:09:15.708 --> 1:09:18.208
<i>Hooper didn't get the memo</i>
<i>about holding positions.</i>

1:09:18.291 --> 1:09:19.583
<i>He's here to race.</i>

1:09:22.041 --> 1:09:23.625
<i>Hooper tries to dive for first.</i>

1:09:31.916 --> 1:09:33.125
Come on!

1:09:33.208 --> 1:09:34.541
He muscles Jack Hooper wide.

1:09:34.625 --> 1:09:36.000
<i>We're on the final lap.</i>

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:40.875
Come on, Jack!

1:09:41.625 --> 1:09:42.708
Come on, move!

1:09:44.083 --> 1:09:46.250
- <i>Show no fear.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Don't go on the outside.</i>

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:47.833
- <i>Be patient.</i>
-I am unbeatable.

1:09:54.833 --> 1:09:56.416
-<i>He loses it!</i>

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:57.416
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.500
<i>I told you you weren't ready.</i>

1:10:01.583 --> 1:10:03.375
<i>Get on the marbles,</i>
<i>you will slide off.</i>

1:11:10.416 --> 1:11:12.666
<i>...they qualify</i>
<i>for the National Championships.</i>

1:11:13.625 --> 1:11:16.875
<i>Jack Hooper finished fourth</i>
<i>and backwards over the finishing line.</i>

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.875
You were second
and we were on our way to Nationals,

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:22.291
and instead you threw it away

1:11:22.375 --> 1:11:25.041
by making a reckless move
that wasted all our time and effort.

1:11:27.041 --> 1:11:28.166
Why would you do that?

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:29.583
I don't know.

1:11:30.875 --> 1:11:31.958
I just had to beat him.

1:11:32.458 --> 1:11:33.333
But you didn't.

1:11:33.416 --> 1:11:36.625
And you didn't even qualify,
so you could beat him when it counted.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.833
You put yourself ahead of the team,

1:11:39.916 --> 1:11:42.041
and I can't be with someone who does that.

1:11:46.083 --> 1:11:47.708
Not enough talent, hey, Patrick?

1:11:49.333 --> 1:11:51.166
Looks like you backed
the wrong horse, mate.

1:11:52.708 --> 1:11:54.916
Come on. Help us load this in.

1:11:57.125 --> 1:11:59.541
Come on. We're doing this for you.
Chop chop.

1:12:02.333 --> 1:12:03.166
What?

1:12:04.458 --> 1:12:05.291
Well...

1:12:05.791 --> 1:12:06.750
if it wasn't for me...

1:12:07.333 --> 1:12:09.416
you'd still be in that caravan
hiding from the world,

1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:11.125
like a sad old man.

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:21.666
You know, that was a bit harsh.

1:12:22.958 --> 1:12:24.041
Shut up, Colin.

1:12:24.625 --> 1:12:25.583
What would you know?

1:12:32.708 --> 1:12:34.583
Hey. Are you okay?

1:12:35.375 --> 1:12:37.291
-I saw the accident.
-Don't want to talk about it.

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:39.041
-Well, I do.
-Don't want to talk about it, Mum.

1:12:39.125 --> 1:12:42.125
-I don't think you should race anymore.
-You don't have to worry about it!

1:12:42.666 --> 1:12:44.583
I didn't make it through to Nationals!

1:12:45.083 --> 1:12:45.958
It's over!

1:13:03.916 --> 1:13:04.750
Yes!

1:13:05.250 --> 1:13:06.833
Go! Yes!

1:13:08.416 --> 1:13:09.791
Finally.

1:13:22.333 --> 1:13:23.166

1:13:32.541 --> 1:13:34.750

Jack?

1:15:57.541 --> 1:15:59.208
Jack, you've got to talk to me.

1:15:59.791 --> 1:16:01.333
Why do you keep doing this?

1:16:07.083 --> 1:16:08.000
It was our thing.

1:16:09.416 --> 1:16:11.375
What? What was?

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:15.958
Donuts.

1:16:19.625 --> 1:16:21.833
Me and Dad used to do them
when we drove around.

1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:26.750
Sometimes, I just...

1:16:28.833 --> 1:16:30.083
miss him so much.

1:16:32.541 --> 1:16:35.041
So I take your car out
and for a little while, I just...

1:16:36.833 --> 1:16:37.666
it's like he's...

1:16:38.166 --> 1:16:39.041
with me again.

1:16:41.833 --> 1:16:43.416
And I don't know how to fix it.

1:16:44.291 --> 1:16:45.208
Fix what?

1:16:47.916 --> 1:16:49.000
The way I feel.

1:16:50.625 --> 1:16:52.000
Our lives without him.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.708
Some things you just can't fix.

1:16:58.041 --> 1:17:00.041
But this pain that you feel...

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:01.958
it'll fade.

1:17:04.833 --> 1:17:05.833
I don't want it to.

1:17:07.916 --> 1:17:10.125
I mean, it's already happening,
and I don't want it to.

1:17:13.583 --> 1:17:14.666
I don't want to forget him.

1:17:15.791 --> 1:17:17.458
Oh, we won't let that happen.

1:17:22.791 --> 1:17:23.750
I'm crying.

1:17:23.833 --> 1:17:25.666
Just let it out. You'll feel better.

1:17:25.750 --> 1:17:28.291
Yeah, well, Dad said
blokes only get three cries in life.

1:17:28.375 --> 1:17:29.416
Well, he was wrong.

1:17:30.625 --> 1:17:32.583
And if I have to choose between this

1:17:32.666 --> 1:17:33.958
and you keeping everything inside

1:17:34.041 --> 1:17:36.500
until you lose it
and steal my car again...

1:17:37.458 --> 1:17:38.708
I choose this.

1:17:40.833 --> 1:17:41.666
Yeah.

1:18:06.250 --> 1:18:07.083
Oi, Colin!

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:11.791
Colin?

1:18:20.875 --> 1:18:21.708
Colin!

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000
Mate, I know you're there.
I can see your curtains twitching.

1:18:33.916 --> 1:18:35.125
I want to apologize.

1:18:38.875 --> 1:18:40.875
Okay. Fair enough.

1:18:41.875 --> 1:18:42.708
I'm sorry.

1:18:43.541 --> 1:18:46.958
I know what I said was terrible,
and I'm an idiot.

1:18:48.875 --> 1:18:50.750
And I don't deserve you as my bestie.

1:19:06.250 --> 1:19:07.916
-Hm.
-What is it?

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:11.250
The driver who came second at State
had an illegal carburetor.

1:19:13.166 --> 1:19:14.333
He's been disqualified.

1:19:15.625 --> 1:19:17.125
And I've been promoted to third.

1:19:17.708 --> 1:19:18.541
Oh.

1:19:19.708 --> 1:19:21.125
And I can race at Nationals.

1:19:23.375 --> 1:19:24.208
Doesn't matter.

1:19:24.916 --> 1:19:26.000
Kart's wrecked.

1:19:26.708 --> 1:19:28.541
I managed to piss off everyone on my team,

1:19:28.625 --> 1:19:30.708
and you don't want me to do it anyway.

1:19:33.833 --> 1:19:35.750
Well, if it's something
that you really love...

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:38.125
I guess I'll just have to be brave.

1:19:39.041 --> 1:19:39.875
Thanks.

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:41.791
Just get your team back together.

1:19:44.750 --> 1:19:45.708
I don't know, Mum.

1:19:46.583 --> 1:19:47.791
I mean, I was terrible.

1:19:48.583 --> 1:19:49.666
I think they'll help.

1:19:50.916 --> 1:19:54.041
You know,
girls kind of like it when you apologize.

1:19:54.666 --> 1:19:55.541
Yeah.

1:20:11.708 --> 1:20:13.625
Heard you lucked through to Nationals.

1:20:14.375 --> 1:20:16.583
And that means
you're gonna need to fix your kart.

1:20:17.916 --> 1:20:20.291
And I'm not gonna let you
steal any more of our parts.

1:20:22.875 --> 1:20:25.458
You do need to be punished
for the last time you robbed us.

1:20:26.666 --> 1:20:28.208
Leave my bestie alone!

1:20:30.625 --> 1:20:32.541
-Standing up to them. Showing no fear.
-I love it!

1:20:33.125 --> 1:20:35.625
-Does it mean you accept my apology?
-Yeah, but don't do it again.

1:20:35.708 --> 1:20:36.541
All right.

1:20:37.583 --> 1:20:38.583
Stop!

1:20:41.333 --> 1:20:42.500
Settle it on the track.

1:20:46.666 --> 1:20:47.833
You're dead, Hooper.

1:20:53.208 --> 1:20:54.208
Mandy...

1:20:56.416 --> 1:20:57.708
Come on, mate. Let's go.

1:21:20.541 --> 1:21:21.375
I, um...

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:23.833
I shouldn't have said what I said.

1:21:26.916 --> 1:21:28.375
Okay, it was stupid and...

1:21:29.375 --> 1:21:30.208
cruel.

1:21:30.875 --> 1:21:32.958
I was upset, and I took it out on you.

1:21:34.541 --> 1:21:36.416
And I hope you can forgive me.

1:21:38.250 --> 1:21:39.208
Well, I can,

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:41.166
because you did get me out of the caravan.

1:21:43.125 --> 1:21:44.541
You want to get out one more time?

1:21:45.333 --> 1:21:46.250
What do you mean?

1:21:47.041 --> 1:21:49.458
The driver who came second
at State was disqualified.

1:21:50.333 --> 1:21:51.333
So...

1:21:51.416 --> 1:21:53.333
we're going to Nationals in his place.

1:21:53.750 --> 1:21:54.750
Oh...

1:21:54.958 --> 1:21:57.333
Listen, that accident of yours...

1:21:58.291 --> 1:21:59.125
was...

1:22:00.958 --> 1:22:02.041
unnerving.

1:22:02.541 --> 1:22:04.791
And I can't go through
something like that again.

1:22:04.875 --> 1:22:06.708
Look, I'm trying to push it to the limit.

1:22:06.791 --> 1:22:08.666
I'm trying to be fearless.

1:22:08.750 --> 1:22:10.250
You don't want to be fearless.

1:22:10.833 --> 1:22:12.458
You don't want that. Fear is good.

1:22:12.541 --> 1:22:14.833
Fear tells you when you push too far.

1:22:14.916 --> 1:22:17.041
Doesn't it separate the winners
from everyone else?

1:22:17.125 --> 1:22:17.958
No.

1:22:18.041 --> 1:22:21.333
It separates the dead men
from those that get to go home.

1:22:24.166 --> 1:22:26.375
It's why I was reluctant to help you
in the first place.

1:22:26.458 --> 1:22:27.333
Then why did you?

1:22:27.416 --> 1:22:30.708
Because, honestly,
when I saw you racing for the first time,

1:22:30.791 --> 1:22:32.500
it was like I was watching myself.

1:22:34.041 --> 1:22:36.958
And I thought I could help you
avoid some of the mistakes that I've made.

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000
What mistakes?

1:22:40.458 --> 1:22:43.625
We were racing.
I was behind my teammate, and I...

1:22:44.750 --> 1:22:48.125
tried an overtake which was risky, stupid.

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:53.375
And we clipped,
and I sent him into the wall.

1:22:54.625 --> 1:22:56.041
Was it the guy in the photo?

1:22:58.125 --> 1:23:01.375
Trying to be fearless on the track,
I ended up killing...

1:23:02.750 --> 1:23:04.750
a man who was very important to me.

1:23:06.916 --> 1:23:10.125
So, honestly, I don't think
I'm the right man to be teaching you--

1:23:10.208 --> 1:23:11.500
You've taught me a lot.

1:23:12.083 --> 1:23:13.708
Let me show you at Nationals.

1:23:16.125 --> 1:23:17.125
No.

1:23:51.916 --> 1:23:52.750
<i>Actually...</i>

1:23:53.250 --> 1:23:54.458
<i>I do want this life.</i>

1:23:55.041 --> 1:23:56.333
<i>But you've taught me a lot.</i>

1:24:01.666 --> 1:24:03.416
<i>Let me show you at Nationals.</i>

1:24:21.500 --> 1:24:23.458
What was the first thing I ever told you?

1:24:24.958 --> 1:24:26.416
The stuff about sinking the boat?

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:28.750
No, no, after that.

1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:30.333
Oh.

1:24:30.833 --> 1:24:32.250
That you don't like backchat?

1:24:33.541 --> 1:24:34.750
No, <i>before </i>that.

1:24:36.791 --> 1:24:38.875
That I don't want a life in motor racing?

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:40.833
Yeah.

1:24:43.041 --> 1:24:44.000
When I said that...

1:24:44.708 --> 1:24:46.416
um, I may have been...

1:24:48.625 --> 1:24:50.125
talking about myself.

1:24:50.875 --> 1:24:52.125
All right? But, you know...

1:24:53.416 --> 1:24:54.291
things change.

1:25:01.583 --> 1:25:03.625
Come on. We've got a kart to fix.

1:25:06.083 --> 1:25:07.083
Chop chop.

1:25:20.166 --> 1:25:22.166
This is the section
where you backed down.

1:25:23.708 --> 1:25:24.708
You can't do that, son.

1:25:25.666 --> 1:25:27.666
See how you've been muscled wide
by that kid?

1:25:28.458 --> 1:25:30.541
You need to be more aggressive
defending your position.

1:25:41.625 --> 1:25:43.500
<i>...come from all around the region.</i>

1:25:43.583 --> 1:25:45.833
<i>Loads of talent from all the young kids.</i>

1:25:45.916 --> 1:25:49.125
<i>I want to throw it to the principal</i>
<i>and the band master</i>

1:25:49.208 --> 1:25:51.583
<i>to tell us about what sort of music</i>
<i>they're gonna play.</i>

1:25:52.333 --> 1:25:54.875
Who are you,
and what have you done with my son?

1:25:54.958 --> 1:25:57.333
See? I do listen to you.

1:26:00.875 --> 1:26:01.708
Okay, well...

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:03.666
I've got to bounce.

1:26:04.208 --> 1:26:06.791
-Wish me luck.
-Luck. I'll see you there.

1:26:08.333 --> 1:26:09.666
Go get 'em, tiger.

1:26:17.791 --> 1:26:20.458
Rounding up the qualifying session
from the KA3

1:26:20.541 --> 1:26:24.416
and it's nationals title favorite
Dean Zeta sitting on pole position.

1:26:26.166 --> 1:26:27.000
Ninth.

1:26:28.708 --> 1:26:29.791
Don't worry about it.

1:26:30.291 --> 1:26:31.208
Refocus.

1:26:32.166 --> 1:26:34.041
My steering was all over the shop.

1:26:34.833 --> 1:26:36.000
I couldn't turn in properly.

1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:38.541
I've got no idea what that is.

1:26:41.250 --> 1:26:42.458
I know someone who will.

1:27:16.333 --> 1:27:17.166
What is it?

1:27:17.875 --> 1:27:18.708
Look...

1:27:19.625 --> 1:27:21.541
I know I was handed the keys to the...

1:27:22.125 --> 1:27:23.291
keys to the castle...

1:27:24.958 --> 1:27:26.125
and dropped them in the moat.

1:27:27.083 --> 1:27:27.916
Okay?

1:27:28.625 --> 1:27:30.000
What are you talking about?

1:27:30.666 --> 1:27:32.333
What I'm trying to say is...

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:35.708
I'm sorry for what I did.

1:27:36.916 --> 1:27:38.416
If I could go back and change it...

1:27:39.291 --> 1:27:40.125
I would.

1:27:41.625 --> 1:27:42.500
But I can't.

1:27:45.583 --> 1:27:46.750
Our team needs you.

1:27:50.166 --> 1:27:51.083
I need you.

1:27:54.333 --> 1:27:55.250
Please come back.

1:27:56.541 --> 1:27:57.375
Please.

1:27:57.875 --> 1:27:59.250
You think adding that second please

1:27:59.333 --> 1:28:01.666
will make the difference
between me saying yes or no?

1:28:13.958 --> 1:28:15.958
<i>With water on the track,</i>
<i>there won't be much grip,</i>

1:28:16.041 --> 1:28:18.791
<i>so we'll see the karts slip and slide</i>
<i>around the corners tonight.</i>

1:28:18.875 --> 1:28:20.833
<i>It should make for an epic race.</i>

1:28:22.833 --> 1:28:25.208
So keeps missing the apexes, right?

1:28:25.708 --> 1:28:27.750
It looked like he was driving
a box of cats.

1:28:27.833 --> 1:28:29.375
We've got 20 minutes till the race.

1:28:30.333 --> 1:28:31.250
What do you think?

1:28:31.750 --> 1:28:32.583
Can you fix it?

1:28:33.625 --> 1:28:35.208
Of course I can. It's me.

1:28:38.416 --> 1:28:39.666
What do you think you're doing?

1:28:43.250 --> 1:28:45.125
I'm chief engineer of this kart.

1:28:45.666 --> 1:28:47.333
What?

1:28:48.125 --> 1:28:49.500
What did you think I was gonna do?

1:28:50.416 --> 1:28:53.375
Wait around, sorting bolts
for people who don't appreciate me?

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:55.333
Would you do that?

1:28:56.416 --> 1:28:57.250
Of course not.

1:28:57.916 --> 1:29:01.458
You never let me work on the kart.
We built this using my ideas.

1:29:01.541 --> 1:29:04.791
It cost one tenth of yours,
and it's quick enough to beat it.

1:29:09.916 --> 1:29:10.791
Come on, Amanda.

1:29:12.916 --> 1:29:14.666
I'm not discussing this
in front of strangers.

1:29:14.750 --> 1:29:16.375
They're not strangers, Dad.

1:29:17.333 --> 1:29:18.375
They're my team.

1:29:29.916 --> 1:29:32.500
"They're not strangers, Dad.
They're my team."

1:29:32.791 --> 1:29:34.458
Boom. That was epic.

1:29:34.541 --> 1:29:37.500
Thank you. Now let's fix this kart
and win this thing, yeah?

1:29:38.250 --> 1:29:39.083
Dad!

1:29:42.041 --> 1:29:43.500
I attack until I lead.

1:29:44.041 --> 1:29:45.250
I take no prisoners.

1:29:46.166 --> 1:29:47.208
I never concede.

1:29:48.083 --> 1:29:51.333
Whoever said winning isn't everything
is a fool who knows nothing.

1:29:52.458 --> 1:29:53.583
I am unbeatable.

1:29:55.833 --> 1:29:58.208
<i>Last call for entrants</i>

1:29:58.291 --> 1:30:00.958
<i>You're required in the marshaling area</i>

1:30:03.416 --> 1:30:04.541
Are you ready?

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:05.958
Yeah, yeah.

1:30:06.416 --> 1:30:07.708
-Do your best.
-Okay.

1:30:08.208 --> 1:30:09.125
But don't be reckless.

1:30:09.958 --> 1:30:11.333
I'll try not to be, but I...

1:30:11.916 --> 1:30:13.166
I lose control and...

1:30:13.958 --> 1:30:15.416
this anger rises inside me.

1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:17.583
Yeah, it's called the red mist.
Keep it open.

1:30:18.958 --> 1:30:19.833
It has a name?

1:30:20.458 --> 1:30:22.708
Yeah. It happens to a lot of people.

1:30:23.416 --> 1:30:25.625
Believe me, if you want to have
any success on the track

1:30:25.708 --> 1:30:26.791
or in life...

1:30:27.500 --> 1:30:29.333
you're gonna have to learn
how to control it.

1:30:29.833 --> 1:30:32.416
-Okay. How do I do that?
-Well...

1:30:33.250 --> 1:30:35.125
the only thing that ever worked for me...

1:30:36.416 --> 1:30:37.666
you take a deep breath...

1:30:38.166 --> 1:30:39.791
and count backwards from five.

1:30:40.958 --> 1:30:41.791
That's it?

1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:44.458
Sometimes the simple things work best.

1:30:46.125 --> 1:30:46.958
Okay.

1:30:47.041 --> 1:30:48.000
Good to know.

1:30:48.541 --> 1:30:51.125
So are you gonna give me
the motivational speech?

1:30:51.208 --> 1:30:52.041
I mean, I think...

1:30:52.791 --> 1:30:56.250
we've established that's not
my strong suit, all right, but...

1:30:58.083 --> 1:30:59.000
hopefully...

1:30:59.916 --> 1:31:01.208
this'll make up for it.

1:31:03.541 --> 1:31:04.375
Patrick...

1:31:05.250 --> 1:31:06.500

-Jack Hooper.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.041

1:32:17.083 --> 1:32:20.250
<i>A monster lunge by Hooper</i>
<i>and he grabs another place!</i>

1:32:21.708 --> 1:32:22.916
Be patient.

1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:27.125
<i>Dean Zeta, showing all of his experience,</i>
<i>and he skips away at the front.</i>

1:32:28.166 --> 1:32:30.083
<i>Hooper threads the needle</i>
<i>through turn three</i>

1:32:30.166 --> 1:32:31.833
<i>with a bucketload of understeer.</i>

1:32:31.916 --> 1:32:33.000
Woo!

1:32:33.583 --> 1:32:35.458
Analyze what the other drivers are doing.

1:32:35.541 --> 1:32:36.916
He's gained another place!

1:32:43.875 --> 1:32:45.583
Take advantage of any mistake.

1:32:46.166 --> 1:32:49.041
<i>Hooper gets a run</i>
<i>and throws one down the inside.</i>

1:32:49.125 --> 1:32:50.416
Go, Jack!

1:33:01.625 --> 1:33:05.000
<i>Hooper looks the only driver</i>
<i>capable of challenging Zeta.</i>

1:33:09.541 --> 1:33:10.708
<i>This is the final lap.</i>

1:33:11.875 --> 1:33:12.750
<i>Here's a chance.</i>

1:33:12.833 --> 1:33:15.875
<i>Hooper thought about it, but Zeta--</i>
<i>Ooh! Slams the door.</i>

1:33:15.958 --> 1:33:17.125
<i>There was no way past.</i>

1:33:17.750 --> 1:33:18.708
<i>I am unbeatable.</i>

1:33:20.750 --> 1:33:22.208
<i>It's called the red mist.</i>

1:33:23.250 --> 1:33:24.666
<i>You have to learn how to control it.</i>

1:33:27.125 --> 1:33:28.083
Five.

1:33:28.166 --> 1:33:29.041
Go get 'em, tiger.

1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:32.708
-Four.
- <i>We can do it.</i>

1:33:33.583 --> 1:33:34.625
Three.

1:33:34.708 --> 1:33:35.708
-Colin Faber.
-Jack.

1:33:35.791 --> 1:33:38.375
<i>-I don't want to miss out on an adventure.</i>
-Two.

1:33:38.958 --> 1:33:40.166
<i>Be patient. Chop chop.</i>

1:33:40.250 --> 1:33:41.166
One.

1:33:43.083 --> 1:33:44.583
<i>Show no fear, mate.</i>

1:33:51.708 --> 1:33:52.625
For you, Dad.

1:33:56.125 --> 1:33:58.708
<i>Zeta and Hooper,</i>
<i>first and second on the road.</i>

1:33:58.791 --> 1:34:00.125
<i>There's just millimeters in it.</i>

1:34:04.958 --> 1:34:06.708
<i>Hooper's going around the outside!</i>

1:34:06.791 --> 1:34:09.458
<i>This is dangerous.</i>
<i>There's absolutely no grip out there.</i>

1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.750
<i>Hooper cuts up the inside</i>
<i>and slingshots out of the final corner!</i>

1:34:13.833 --> 1:34:15.208
<i>Zeta's right with him.</i>

1:34:15.291 --> 1:34:16.583
<i>-But Hooper passes!</i>
-Woo!

1:34:16.666 --> 1:34:17.958
<i>-What a finish!</i>
-Yeah!

1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:20.833
-Woo!

1:34:21.833 --> 1:34:24.916
Jack Hooper is your new national champion.

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:26.916
<i>What a drive. What a mega race.</i>

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.250
<i>That was Australian motorsport</i>
<i>at its finest.</i>

1:34:29.333 --> 1:34:31.833
<i>Dean Zeta finished second.</i>
<i>Jack Kagan was third,</i>

1:34:31.916 --> 1:34:33.291
<i>rounding out the top three.</i>

1:34:37.791 --> 1:34:38.666
Ah!

1:34:39.333 --> 1:34:41.875
-I couldn't have done it without you.
-I know.

1:34:52.208 --> 1:34:53.666
Did you count back from five?

1:34:54.833 --> 1:34:55.875
Yep.

1:34:56.458 --> 1:34:57.375
Pretty good, huh?

1:35:06.125 --> 1:35:06.958
You did well.

1:35:13.250 --> 1:35:14.083
Patrick...

1:35:17.083 --> 1:35:17.916
Thank you.

1:35:35.750 --> 1:35:36.583
Thanks.

1:35:49.666 --> 1:35:50.541
You did great.

1:35:53.416 --> 1:35:54.250
You all did.

1:36:03.666 --> 1:36:05.250
I'm, uh... I'm gonna give Patrick a hand.

1:36:06.333 --> 1:36:08.208
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please join us</i>

1:36:08.291 --> 1:36:09.791

1:36:35.458 --> 1:36:36.291
Come on.

1:36:43.416 --> 1:36:44.375
Mwah!
