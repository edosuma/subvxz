WEBVTT

00:04.439 --> 00:06.049
- Whoo!
Party bus.

00:06.093 --> 00:09.009
- Okay, a toast!
To our girl Sandra--

00:09.052 --> 00:10.532
Whoo-whoo--

00:10.575 --> 00:12.664
for being awesome,

00:12.708 --> 00:14.318
for finding true love,

00:14.362 --> 00:16.320
and most importantly,

00:16.364 --> 00:17.495
for giving me
my first chance

00:17.539 --> 00:20.020
to par-tay
in, like, decades.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.064
Thank you.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.152
- All right,
let's get drunk

00:22.196 --> 00:24.676
and take this bitch
to see a horse.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.898
- You guys are the best.
I love you all.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.726
- Aw...
- Aw!

00:30.769 --> 00:33.033
- Wait!
Don't eat that.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.165
They're filled
with laxatives.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- What? Why?

00:36.732 --> 00:38.473
I mean, I get that some of you
may have that problem.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.214
For the record,
I do not.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.259
My doctor is begging me
to eat less fiber.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.347
I won't do it.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.566
- I wanted Sandra
to get sick

00:44.609 --> 00:46.829
so tomorrow
would be ruined, okay?

00:46.872 --> 00:48.135
- What the hell, Carol?

00:48.178 --> 00:49.179
- I knew
you hadn't changed.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.094
- I'm sorry.
I tried.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.705
But I just couldn't
let the anger go.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.229
I'm a mess.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.100
I shouldn't be
any part of this.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.537
- Mmm, that cupcake
was delicious.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.279
Mmm.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.238
- Ooh, someone should tell him.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.109
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:06.153 --> 01:07.589
- Maybe he'll be fine.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.070
- Oh, he's not fine.

01:19.209 --> 01:21.429
- I knew we were here
too early.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.083
They haven't even finished
setting up the...

01:23.126 --> 01:24.345
s-ship?

01:24.388 --> 01:26.869
Is--is it a cowboy ship?

01:26.912 --> 01:28.175
- No, their theme is nautical,

01:28.218 --> 01:29.524
but they got this
western place for cheap

01:29.567 --> 01:31.221
because Jerry got hit
by a dart here.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.875
Oh--bar!
Come on.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.224
- Wow, going right at it, huh?

01:34.268 --> 01:35.356
- Yeah, well,
I didn't get to cut loose

01:35.399 --> 01:36.444
at the
bachelorette party,

01:36.487 --> 01:38.141
so I'm cutting
twice as loose tonight.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.403
My phone is on
do not disturb,

01:39.447 --> 01:41.710
and my liver
is on high alert.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.364
- That's where you think
your liver is?

01:43.407 --> 01:45.757
- I don't know.
Where's my liver?

01:45.801 --> 01:48.238
- It--it's not there.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.761
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry, folks.

01:49.805 --> 01:50.806
I'm not open yet.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.547
- Oh, okay.
No worries.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.071
But you've got bottles,
and glasses,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.204
and the garnish buffets
all set up.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.205
Looks good to go!

01:58.248 --> 01:59.945
- And yet, nope.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.338
- No rush.
No rush at all.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.731
- No, please.
God, no.

02:02.774 --> 02:03.732
No, no, take your time.

02:03.775 --> 02:04.950
But, you know,
when the time comes,

02:04.994 --> 02:07.605
I would love
an old-fashioned.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.738
Or, you know,
something like quick and easy

02:09.781 --> 02:11.261
like a beer--
there's a bunch of them here.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.784
I could just--
- Ma'am.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.090
- Sorry.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.745
I was just trying
to help you.

02:17.311 --> 02:20.488
- I said ma'am.
- He did say ma'am.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.581
- Oh, hey, Glenn.
- Mm-hmm?

02:26.624 --> 02:27.973
- Getting ready
for the ceremony?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.279
- Yeah. You bet.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.194
I know this
backwards and forwards.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.370
Though I would not
recommend it backwards.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.285
I sound like a lunatic.
- Yeah.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.721
- So how's
your toast coming?

02:36.765 --> 02:38.462
- Oh, well, you know,
I'm still working it out.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.856
I just have this, like,
little story about him.

02:40.899 --> 02:41.944
Basically,
Jerry and Sandra

02:41.987 --> 02:43.815
have this sweatshirt
with a crab on it,

02:43.859 --> 02:46.601
and whoever's feeling crabby
has to wear the sweatshirt.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.037
And the only time
Jerry's worn it

02:48.080 --> 02:50.953
is when Sandra
was out of town.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.085
- That's nice.
And then?

02:53.129 --> 02:54.826
- That's--Well,
that--that's it.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.001
- Oh, that--that's--

02:56.045 --> 02:57.089
that's your whole speech?

02:57.133 --> 02:58.613
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

02:58.656 --> 03:01.311
Well, I do not see
a problem with that.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.356
- It sounds like you do.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.705
- No, no, no.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.229
What I'm saying is
there's no disaster ahead.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.665
You know,
nobody's going to hate you.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.058
- Hate me?
Why would anyone hate me?

03:09.101 --> 03:12.192
- That's what I'm saying.
Most of them won't.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.671
Yeah.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.021
- I bet this place sees
a lot of ill-fitting denim.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.807
- Yeah, just imagine how many
bad butts have been in here.

03:18.850 --> 03:19.938
- Call me an optimist,

03:19.982 --> 03:21.897
but I think
there are no bad butts.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.507
There's just bad pants.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.509
- Aw,
that's beautiful.

03:25.553 --> 03:28.251
- Okay, I'm going to hit
the little cowboys' room.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.688
Not my words.
It says that on the door.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.214
- So?

03:34.257 --> 03:37.042
- Oh! He's great!
Yeah, he's so nice.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.218
- I know,
we're working on

03:38.261 --> 03:39.262
getting him to
talk trash about people.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.742
- Yeah, it just
takes practice.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.526
He'll be a nasty bitch
real soon.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.658
- Thanks.

03:43.701 --> 03:44.876
I was a little worried,
you know,

03:44.920 --> 03:46.530
inviting him to a wedding
this early on.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.053
But then I thought it'd be
weirder not to bring him.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.534
- Totally--that's how it was
for me and Bo at homecoming.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.058
But then we just did a bunch
of whip-its in the DJ's van,

03:53.102 --> 03:55.017
and it was great.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.540
- I say this with love--

03:56.584 --> 03:58.020
it's crazy
you haven't been murdered.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.674
- I know.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.545
- But you're not
some kind of nerd like Glenn.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.720
You're just going
to find your speech

04:02.764 --> 04:04.592
in, like, the moment, right?
- No, sir.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.811
I take my maid of honor
duties very seriously.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.335
So I've rehearsed it
down to the syllable.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.554
I know exactly where
I'm going to...

04:10.598 --> 04:12.948
almost start to cry.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.384
And where I'm going to...

04:14.428 --> 04:16.560
get myself a little bit
with my own joke.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.258
And then I'm going to
bring it home

04:18.301 --> 04:22.479
with a series...
of meaningful...pauses.

04:22.523 --> 04:25.569
- So you have thought about it.
All right.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.397
- Guys, they haven't
put out the shrimp yet,

04:27.441 --> 04:28.659
in case anyone is wondering.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.835
I saw cocktail sauce, though,
so we are close.

04:30.879 --> 04:33.447
- Oh, whew.
- The wedding starts soon.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.449
Shouldn't all this stuff
be ready by now?

04:35.492 --> 04:37.320
- Carol snapped
and left us hanging,

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
Sandra's sister is useless,
and Jerry's family members

04:39.453 --> 04:41.237
are definitely
related to Jerry.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.586
- You know, it's funny.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.240
I always thought
if Carol snapped,

04:44.284 --> 04:47.287
she'd do something crazier than
putting laxatives in cupcakes.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.766
- What do you mean?
- I just thought

04:48.810 --> 04:50.246
she'd go bigger.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.900
Plus, I'm surprised she did it
at the bachelorette party,

04:51.943 --> 04:54.337
instead of the day
Sandra marries her ex.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.991
- In front of all her
friends and family.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.688
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

04:59.734 --> 05:00.952
- You don't think

05:00.996 --> 05:02.867
Carol's behind
the shrimp delay, do you?

05:02.911 --> 05:05.000
- Yes, definitely.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.001
- Strike two.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.003
- What is that
bartender's problem?

05:08.046 --> 05:10.353
This is a wedding,
not a rules convention.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.181
Get me a drink!

05:12.224 --> 05:13.878
- I feel like flirting with him
could've worked,

05:13.922 --> 05:15.532
calling him a fascist
could've worked,

05:15.576 --> 05:17.926
but I think doing both
just kind of confused him.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.450
Okay, centerpieces, chairs...

05:20.494 --> 05:22.583
- Hey, Dina.
Everything okay?

05:22.626 --> 05:23.714
- Carol's going
to do something.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.542
I can feel it.
- What? No.

05:25.586 --> 05:26.978
Carol's working
at the store tonight.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.415
She's not even here.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.720
- What if she threw us off
the scent by making us think

05:29.764 --> 05:31.287
her plan was over
at the bachelorette

05:31.331 --> 05:32.897
so we'd let down our guard
at the wedding?

05:32.941 --> 05:34.856
The wedding that
she helped design?

05:34.899 --> 05:36.336
Huh?

05:36.379 --> 05:37.467
If Sandra makes it
through today without

05:37.511 --> 05:38.990
being decapitated,
it will be a miracle.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.731
- Dina, it does seem like
there's a lot

05:40.775 --> 05:42.124
that still needs to get done.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.473
Isn't that kind of your job?

05:43.517 --> 05:45.345
- My job is
keeping the bride safe.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.650
I need to find a sewer map.

05:46.694 --> 05:49.174
- Um, wait, Dina.
Who--

05:50.437 --> 05:51.873
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.745
This is not your problem.
You have a liver to ruin.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.747
- Yes, but--
- I'm sure

05:56.791 --> 05:57.835
they're going to
figure it out.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.663
- Yeah, yeah, no.
Totally, totally.

05:59.707 --> 06:03.014
Things have a way
of working out for Sandra.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.887
- Hey, guys.
Having fun?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.279
Don't forget to sign
the guestbook.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.498
- Sandra!

06:08.542 --> 06:10.413
You look beautiful!
- Yeah!

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
- And why are you
carrying chairs?

06:12.459 --> 06:13.547
- Yeah, do you need
a hand, or--

06:13.590 --> 06:15.287
- No, no, no.
It's just, uh,

06:15.331 --> 06:16.506
I don't know where Dina is,

06:16.550 --> 06:19.814
and, uh, Jerry's busy
parking cars, so...

06:19.857 --> 06:21.206
It's fine.
You guys are guests.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.904
Sit down, enjoy.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.124
- I have to.
- I know.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.169
- I hate it.
- I know.

06:27.212 --> 06:29.476
- Oh, God.
Sandra, stop, please.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.260
I-I will make sure
everything gets done.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.479
You go. Get ready.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.612
- Oh, really?
Thank you so much.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.223
Maybe I can still get
into the family photos.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.443
- Yes. Go, go, go.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.445
- I can't wait
to have some champagne.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.882
Me, too.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.496
- All right, guys,
listen up.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.714
There is still a lot
that needs to get done,

06:50.758 --> 06:52.020
and it is crunch time.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.630
I'm going to finish
the centerpieces,

06:53.674 --> 06:55.458
Jonah, you set up the chairs.
Cheyenne, can you make sure

06:55.502 --> 06:56.894
that the sound system's
working?

06:56.938 --> 06:59.767
- Oh, God, yeah,
I totally forgot. Sorry.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.422
- Had you already
asked her to do that?

07:02.465 --> 07:03.945
- No.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.037
- Dina, hey.
Are they inviting me after all?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.517
'Cause I did throw my
nice socks in the car,

07:10.560 --> 07:11.648
just in case.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.171
- No, you're still
not wanted here.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.695
Look, I'm worried that Carol
is plotting something.

07:14.738 --> 07:15.783
Has she been acting weird?

07:15.826 --> 07:18.394
- I guess, like,
her regular level.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
- Okay, yeah,
what's her energy like?

07:19.482 --> 07:21.136
Is she laughing to herself?

07:21.179 --> 07:22.703
Rubbing her hands
together maniacally?

07:22.746 --> 07:24.618
- Okay.
She's eating a sandwich,

07:24.661 --> 07:26.620
not in an evil way,
but...

07:26.663 --> 07:29.927
it's not so positive, either.
Should I send a pic?

07:29.971 --> 07:31.755
- Absolutely, you should.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.191
- Okay, the seating cards
are placed.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.106
Sandra's cat has the ring.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.673
Jonah, do you want to go
make sure that the caterers

07:36.717 --> 07:38.022
have everything that they need?

07:38.066 --> 07:39.633
- On it.
Also, are we hanging

07:39.676 --> 07:41.896
these fishing nets?
They're so wet.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.594
Were they just used?

07:44.638 --> 07:45.943
Oh, wow.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.729
You--uh, you really went
all out, huh?

07:48.772 --> 07:51.906
- The invitation said Cowboy
Charlie's Old West Steakhouse.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.864
I assumed what
any sane person would.

07:53.908 --> 07:54.996
- I told you.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.432
- Oh, you love this,
don't you?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.390
This is the greatest gift
I could give you.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.436
And now you give me
the cold shoulder.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.742
Perfect!

08:01.785 --> 08:04.048
- Make sure
we're at their table.

08:04.092 --> 08:08.183
- ♪ I'll take you home

08:08.226 --> 08:11.926
♪ Happenin' now,
I'll take you home ♪

08:11.969 --> 08:13.493
- Oh, thanks.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.538
Hey, man,
sorry about earlier.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.192
It's my eighth
straight day of work.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.194
I'm usually better
with pushy guests.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.630
Although, they're usually
much older.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.981
And whiter, too.
- Well, she breaks barriers.

08:24.895 --> 08:27.985
So they have you setting up
the bar and all the food?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.421
- Man, this company
is so cheap,

08:29.465 --> 08:31.380
they never send
enough people.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.209
But, hey, at least they pay us
a whopping 9 bucks an hour.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.298
- 9 bucks?
That's--wow!

08:36.341 --> 08:39.127
Hey, you know, I actually work

08:39.170 --> 08:41.303
with an organization
that can help you.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.132
Here, take my card.
There's a link to the web--

08:44.175 --> 08:45.307
- Man, I don't want to join
another cult.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.657
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm with Raise the Wage.

08:47.701 --> 08:51.008
You deserve better than this.
Look us up.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.445
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

08:53.489 --> 08:56.927
So do I give off, like,
a cult leader vibe?

08:56.971 --> 08:59.582
- I didn't say leader.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.670
- Ah.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.455
- You took over a wedding.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.196
This is the Amy-est thing
I've ever seen.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.807
- I don't want to be
doing this.

09:06.850 --> 09:07.808
I'm just trying
to make this

09:07.851 --> 09:09.200
the best day
of their dumb lives.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.028
- Tell me how to help.
- Now you want to help,

09:11.072 --> 09:12.508
when we're almost done?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.770
Next time, figure out
how to help on your own.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.555
I'm not going to help you help.
- You see?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.165
She's like a 12-year-old
when I'm around.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.296
- Oh, shut up, Eric.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.428
I'm like this
all the time, idiot.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.256
- Oh, she's so mad.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.127
This is my favorite.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.826
I mean, Eric, stop.
Come on, she's my boss.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.830
- I think everyone
would understand

09:29.873 --> 09:31.614
if you just went home.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.834
- Trust me, when Sandra
and Jerry come out in their

09:33.877 --> 09:36.576
western garb, you're all
going to look like fools.

09:37.751 --> 09:40.188
- Dina, we should
get this thing started.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.582
This place has
line dancing at 10:00,

09:42.625 --> 09:45.976
and I'm not sure line dancers
take kindly to boat people.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.543
- I haven't locked
everything down yet.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.023
- Well, we're already
20 minutes behind.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.199
- Yeah, we've got
to get things going.

09:51.242 --> 09:54.202
- I'm telling you,
it isn't safe.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.399
- Ohh...

10:26.190 --> 10:27.539
- Jerry and Sandra

10:27.583 --> 10:30.804
have requested
a non-religious ceremony,

10:30.847 --> 10:33.720
so I'd just like say
that the following

10:33.763 --> 10:36.592
is from a book
I highly recommend,

10:36.636 --> 10:39.247
written by the greatest
and most powerful author

10:39.290 --> 10:41.553
in history of the world,
so...

10:41.597 --> 10:45.122
"Love is patient,
love is kind.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.298
Love does not envy."

10:47.342 --> 10:49.344
- Bomb!

10:49.387 --> 10:52.390
Everyone, stay calm,
even though there is a bomb!

10:52.434 --> 10:53.435
- It's not a bomb,
not a bomb.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.742
It-it's my ankle monitor.
I just--

10:55.785 --> 10:57.613
I-I thought I charged it.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.355
S-Sorry, everyone.
So sorry, sorry.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.705
Sorry, sorry,
I-I'm just going to--

11:02.749 --> 11:04.489
I--
Mazel.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.803
- Oh, no.
- I know, so embarrassing.

11:13.847 --> 11:14.761
- Yeah.
- Poor guy.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.459
- Yeah.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.464
- Never mind.
Go, Glenn, go.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.335
- Yeah, well--
- Get back in.

11:27.469 --> 11:30.559
Ah, okay, um--
Jesus Christ...

11:30.602 --> 11:32.909
is not welcome here.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.781
So, um...

11:36.826 --> 11:41.744
So, something fun about
Jerry and Sandra is that

11:41.788 --> 11:43.833
they have this
little tradition.

11:43.877 --> 11:47.445
When one of them gets crabby,
they have to wear a T-shirt

11:47.489 --> 11:48.838
with a crab on it.

11:48.882 --> 11:53.843
But the only time
that Jerry ever put it on

11:53.887 --> 11:55.715
was when Sandra left town.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.934
audience: Aww.
- Aww, that's sweet.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.458
- I know, it's cute, isn't it?
It's a little insight

12:00.502 --> 12:02.852
into who they are as people.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.593
What the , man?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.859
- Dina, a bomb?
Really?

12:09.903 --> 12:12.906
Nothing happened, okay?
Everything's fine.

12:12.949 --> 12:15.604
So get it together and
give Sandra what she needs.

12:15.647 --> 12:16.953
A lovely toast,

12:16.997 --> 12:19.782
some assurance that she's
better than her sister,

12:19.826 --> 12:21.697
and no drama.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.700
- Yeah, I got it.
Sorry.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.270
- Jonah, what are you doing?

12:29.313 --> 12:32.490
- Just, uh, grabbing myself
some grub.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.144
How about I grab you some
and meet you back over there

12:34.188 --> 12:36.799
at the table?
- Um, doesn't catering

12:36.843 --> 12:37.887
have people who can do this?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.759
- Uh, yeah, they did.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.978
Until a bunch of them
walked off.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.066
They got really upset
about the pay.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.372
You know,
these things bubble up,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.330
no rhyme or reason--
- You too, man?

12:46.374 --> 12:49.681
- I-I forgot how inspiring
I can be.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.814
- Justine, how are you
at cutting cake?

12:51.858 --> 12:56.514
- Honestly, weird.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.518
- Hey.
- How's it going?

13:00.562 --> 13:02.694
- The charging light
is acting up.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.392
I called ICE to complain,
but, you know,

13:04.435 --> 13:07.438
they're not really known
for their customer service.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.005
So embarrassing.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.442
- Whatever, it was exciting.
And now you're, like,

13:11.486 --> 13:12.792
the story of the wedding.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.750
- Yeah, it's fine.
Just juice that bad boy up,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.970
and we'll get back out there.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.319
- It takes two hours.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.669
- What?
- You two should go.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.192
I'm good.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.151
I saw that Lasagna Bear
is trending on twitter,

13:24.194 --> 13:27.850
so I definitely have to see
what that's all about.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.940
- I'm going to hang out.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.987
I like it in here.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.640
- Cool, okay,
you two hang.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.381
Because to me,
this room sucks.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.557
I mean, compared to out there,
where the party is?

13:39.601 --> 13:42.169
This is not close.

13:42.212 --> 13:46.042
both: ♪ You're my weirdo

13:46.086 --> 13:50.873
♪ I'm so happy
that you're here ♪

13:50.917 --> 13:54.572
♪ We both belong here

13:54.616 --> 13:59.882
♪ We both
belong here ♪

14:04.931 --> 14:07.194
- Hey, I just wanted
to say thank you.

14:07.237 --> 14:10.545
Your anecdote really got me
back on track.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.243
And it went over great.
I booked three more weddings.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.766
- Hey, Glenn,
that's the only story I had.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.551
That's all I know about them.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.814
- Okay, I'm sorry.
I just--I panicked.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.077
But you're going to be fine.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.992
I remember you told me
something about

14:23.036 --> 14:25.821
you and Jerry eating corn,
so maybe go with that.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.257
- What?
We ate corn once.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.607
- Well, don't just
blurt it out.

14:29.651 --> 14:33.350
Come on, paint me a picture.
What time of day was it?

14:33.394 --> 14:36.788
Was there butter? Hmm?
Was there salt?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.227
- Marcus, I realize
you feel left out,

14:40.270 --> 14:42.316
but you have to let the invited
move on with our lives.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.579
- No, I'm calling to see
if we have a spare key

14:44.622 --> 14:46.929
to the printer ink case.
Elias can't find one,

14:46.973 --> 14:48.061
and Carol's not answering
her walkie.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.714
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.282
No one knows where she is,
and it's a bad time, man.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.936
We've got that
Saturday night ink rush.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.244
- It's go time.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.986
- So I don't have access
to the printer case,

15:00.029 --> 15:03.467
but I can offer you
condoms or razors.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.382
Take your pick.

15:05.426 --> 15:08.690
- A lot of people assume
I'm the younger sister,

15:08.733 --> 15:10.822
and I am.
It's pretty obvious.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.173
Love you.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.305
Remember to moisturize, okay?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.960
And now, I'm going to
pass it on to the best man,

15:18.004 --> 15:21.442
Jerry's best friend, Garrett.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.791
- Here we go.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.794
So, uh,

15:25.837 --> 15:29.667
one story that comes
to mind when I think of Jerry

15:29.711 --> 15:33.410
is Jerry and I went to...

15:37.284 --> 15:39.242
A rodeo.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.288
Yeah, yeah, it's funny,

15:41.331 --> 15:43.159
because we're
in a cowboy restaurant,

15:43.203 --> 15:45.901
but I would've told this story
either way.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.859
Um, so we're
at the rodeo, right?

15:47.903 --> 15:52.908
And we're watching these guys
ride the bucking broncos.

15:52.952 --> 15:58.348
And Jerry leans over to me
and says...

15:58.392 --> 16:02.091
"I can do that."

16:02.135 --> 16:04.746
- Really?

16:04.789 --> 16:08.010
- It was so sad.
So sad.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.926
- You sure I can't
get you a drink?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.233
- No.
- Cranberry juice?

16:13.276 --> 16:16.018
- What do I have,
a UTI?

16:16.062 --> 16:20.588
Sorry.
Just go enjoy the wedding.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.546
- That sounds like something
someone says but they don't

16:22.590 --> 16:25.419
actually want you to do it.
- It's not like that, okay?

16:25.462 --> 16:28.117
There's no reason for both
of us to be stuck back here.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.425
- You sure?
- Please, just go have fun!

16:31.468 --> 16:34.994
- All right,
I'll be back in a few.

16:35.037 --> 16:38.214
Rude.

16:38.258 --> 16:41.435
- So we're flying, okay?
We're doing 80

16:41.478 --> 16:43.350
down the freeway,
and the mob guys

16:43.393 --> 16:46.918
are chasing us 'cause they had
money on the rodeo, all right?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.268
And I lean over to Jerry.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.487
I go, "Jerry, what are you
getting me into here?"

16:50.531 --> 16:52.794
And Jerry,
calm as a cucumber,

16:52.837 --> 16:56.580
looks at me, tips down
his sunglasses, and goes,

16:56.624 --> 16:58.060
"Welcome to my life."

17:00.323 --> 17:02.760
- "Welcome to my life"!
- So, Sandra,

17:02.804 --> 17:04.501
welcome to Jerry's life.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.983
Let's all raise a glass
to many more adventures.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.899
Congratulations.
all: Cheers.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.075
- When did you get
sunglasses?

17:13.119 --> 17:15.599
- I guess at a rodeo.
- All right, so next up,

17:15.643 --> 17:19.951
we have the maid of honor.
Um, Dina?

17:19.995 --> 17:22.084
Anyone?
5'9", brown hair,

17:22.128 --> 17:23.825
shouted, "Bomb!"
during the ceremony?

17:23.868 --> 17:27.437
- Damn it, Dina.
You had one job.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.223
- Uh, okay.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.921
Uh, so what else can I tell
you guys about Jerry?

17:32.964 --> 17:35.880
Um, apparently
anything I want.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.753
- Okay.
- Dina, come on, you--

17:38.796 --> 17:41.538
- What the hell?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.065
- So your crisis of conscience

17:46.108 --> 17:47.240
at the bachelorette?
- Totally fake.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.632
I wanted you all
to let your guard down.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.721
- I knew it! Yes!
But what are you doing now?

17:50.765 --> 17:52.375
Are you gonna kill
Sandra's cat?

17:52.419 --> 17:53.420
- Dina, she's not
gonna kill the--

17:53.463 --> 17:54.595
- I'm gonna kill
the cat.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.119
- Oh, yes--two for two!

17:57.163 --> 18:00.731
- "Oh, I'm marrying Jerry.
It's the best day of my life."

18:00.775 --> 18:02.603
We'll see about that
when your cat explodes

18:02.646 --> 18:03.734
on the dance floor.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.693
- Wait, you're going
to blow up the cat?

18:05.736 --> 18:07.782
- Okay, that was misleading.
I'm going to throw it

18:07.825 --> 18:09.349
over the balcony,
and ideally,

18:09.392 --> 18:11.264
the impact
will make it explode.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.048
- Carol,
you can't do that!

18:13.092 --> 18:14.702
- Yeah, that carrier's
way too sturdy.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.225
The cat will never explode.
- No, Dina.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.966
I mean, like,
she shouldn't kill the cat.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.490
- Yeah, and she won't, if she
throws it in that carrier.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.536
- It could totally
die in here, Dina.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.754
- It's a 15-foot drop.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.452
These things are built
sturdy for travel.

18:25.495 --> 18:26.975
It will absorb
all of the impact.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.281
- Dina, this really
isn't the point.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.760
- This is a very good plan.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.588
- It is a terrible plan.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.373
The bottom's completely
rubberized. Look at it.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.592
- No, it's not
completely--oh!

18:35.636 --> 18:37.159
Oh!

18:37.203 --> 18:39.292
We got the cat back!

18:39.335 --> 18:42.643
We? You just stood there
with your wang in the wind!

I love being stuck back here,

My little friend.
Plus, my phone died,

19:01.879 --> 19:05.187
and Eric hasn't
been by in an hour, so...

19:05.231 --> 19:06.667
- Yeah.

19:06.710 --> 19:10.279
- He left, didn't he?

19:10.323 --> 19:11.802
- I'm sorry.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.501
- I don't blame him.
It's my fault.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.067
I don't know
what I was thinking,

19:16.111 --> 19:18.069
trying to get into
a normal relationship.

19:18.113 --> 19:23.205
It was going so well, you know,
that I forgot about all this.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.729
It's just too much to ask him
to deal with, you know?

19:25.773 --> 19:27.688
- Well, I can stay
here with you,

19:27.731 --> 19:29.733
and we can watch
Lasagna Bear on my phone.

19:29.777 --> 19:30.865
- I watched it.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.345
It's just a bear
eating a lasagna.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.694
I don't know what
I was expecting.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.175
- Yeah, the internet
has gotten so bad.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.177
- Yeah, I think it's over.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.482
- Sorry to interrupt,

19:39.526 --> 19:42.703
but I was wondering
if you wanted to dance.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.490
- The cat's not going
to last....

19:47.534 --> 19:50.754
- Dina, where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.756
You missed your speech.
- Hey, Sandra.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.932
Listen, I know Dina's
been all over the place.

19:54.976 --> 19:58.371
But just trust me,
it was for a good reason.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.721
- Was it her?

20:00.764 --> 20:02.679
Was it bad?

20:02.723 --> 20:04.594
- Almost.
- Is it over?

20:04.638 --> 20:07.162
- It's over.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.424
Oh.

20:08.468 --> 20:09.904
- Aww.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.906

kind of a private moment.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.561

20:14.604 --> 20:16.432

I was looking for you.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.433
Everything okay?

20:17.477 --> 20:18.739
