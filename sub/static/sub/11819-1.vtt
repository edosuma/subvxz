already Hollywood's new sweetheart!
How do you explain that?"

45:04.413 --> 45:07.165

"I'm not kidding, Clifton.
You're fired."

58:52.324 --> 58:55.285

yourself another job."

"We're ready. Go get
Miss Miller."

01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:30.697
"He's out of danger.
He needs rest now."

01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:47.422
"He was clutching this. It was
hard to get it away from him."

01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:28.547
"You think he could
rest at my house?"

01:18:39.553 --> 01:18:43.557
"I have to be on the set at nine o'clock.
We're shooting a very important scene."

01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:28.185
"Just think of it! *Sparkle of Love*,
starring George Valentin and Peppy Miller!"

01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:50.290
"George is a silent movie
actor. He's a nobody now."

01:20:00.551 --> 01:20:02.427
"What are you doing?"

01:20:07.432 --> 01:20:09.685
"I won't work anymore.
It's either him or me."

01:20:20.696 --> 01:20:24.074
"What I mean is, it's him AND
me! Or it's neither of us!"

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:36.545
"Hey, I'm blackmailing
you! Get it?"

01:21:05.449 --> 01:21:07.701
"All right, send him
the damn screenplay."

01:21:47.074 --> 01:21:49.701
"I work for Miss Miller now."

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.668
"Once again, she's
looking out for you."

01:22:31.451 --> 01:22:35.664
"Beware of your pride, if I may say so sir.
Miss Miller is a good person, believe me."

01:29:10.184 --> 01:29:12.060
"CLIFTON!"

01:32:22.918 --> 01:32:25.546
"BANG!"

01:32:59.037 --> 01:33:04.042
"I feel so bad. I only wanted to
help you, take care of you..."

01:33:39.661 --> 01:33:42.664
"If only you would let
me help you, George Valentin."

01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:51.548
"It's impossible, Peppy. I'm washed up.
No one wants to see me speak."

01:33:59.306 --> 01:34:02.309
"There is one thing we
could try. Trust me."
