00:26.693 --> 00:28.479
My lords and ladies!

00:28.654 --> 00:32.238
Today, your Queen
will choose her champion.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.366
Here he will battle
for not only her honor,

00:37.204 --> 00:39.069
but for a title
of his own.

00:40.958 --> 00:45.327
But only if he can defeat

wouldst thou fight
for my honor?

To the death,
Your Majesty.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.557
Let's hope it does not
come to that, eh?

01:09.403 --> 01:12.315
I choose Sir William
as my champion.

Attack from
his left side.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.080
I saw his squire
bandaging that shoulder
this morning.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.331
I wish thee
luck and strength.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.169
And for the record,
a little bit cold.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.342
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that anyone was home.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.841
James had an early call,
and l was just leaving.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.683
Without breakfast?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.429
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm Sam, by the way.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.511
House. Nice to meet you.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.096
It'd be nicer
if you put this on.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.440
So you and Wilson...

06:00.527 --> 06:03.735
Thought you were staying
in New York last night.

06:03.822 --> 06:08.236
Sorry, must have missed
the "if this trailer be
a-rocking" sign out front.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.821
I'm really late, so...

06:11.997 --> 06:16.240
If there's any chance
that we can pretend
this never happened,

06:17.043 --> 06:19.159
I'd be completely
fine with that.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.848
An eight-year-old
with bleeding ears.

06:30.932 --> 06:35.141
I'll see your bleeding ears
and raise you a total
muscular degeneration.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.468
What the hell?

06:40.025 --> 06:43.108
I had a dream
like this once.
It didn't end well.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.361
Huzzah,
my loyal peasants.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.733
House,
what are you doing?

06:47.824 --> 06:50.406
Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl
at the Goldstein Bris.

06:51.411 --> 06:55.654
While I'm busy,
you all can check out
the knight down in the ER,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.786
who instead
of seizing the throne,
just seized.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.583
He works at
a Renaissance festival?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.161
Doesn't work there,
he lives there.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.497
He's part of
a wonderful
little troupe

07:05.592 --> 07:08.049
who spend their weekends
re-enacting a nobler age

07:08.136 --> 07:11.048
when people crapped in
the streets and Thirteen
would've been a grandmother.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.256
Weeks, not weekends.
Says here he's been
camping out for a month.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.262
Try doing that
with a pen.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.939
Why don't you put
that down before
you kill one of us?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.392
Better idea.
Why don't you give me
something I can use

07:25.487 --> 07:26.567
so I won't feel
the need to?

07:26.655 --> 07:29.943
Seizure right after
a fight obviously
suggests concussion.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.866
Obviously it isn't,
or the ER wouldn't
have called House.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.535
A full suit of armor
would protect against
visible trauma,

07:35.622 --> 07:37.158
but not transmitted
concussive force.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.625
Could be a subdural
hematoma.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.041
(SIGHING)
You're forgetting
to demonize.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.964
An evil, satanic
subdural hematoma.

07:45.048 --> 07:49.712
No, two demon eyes.
Hemorrhaging
in the sclerae.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.135
Could be an allergic reaction
to something from
the Renaissance fair.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.133
Which is why
we need to check
out Middle Earth.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.636
Foreman, take Frodo
and break bread
with the Hobbits.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.136
I still think
a hematoma
is more likely.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.970
That's why you
and Chase are
gonna get an MRI.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.144
But you just...

08:02.232 --> 08:04.063
I said Frodo,
not Gollum.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.398
Is he saying
I have short legs
or hairy feet?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.024
I don't even know
who Frodo is.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.660
Who's the chick,
and why are you
hiding her?

08:16.746 --> 08:18.486
You were home
last night?

08:18.581 --> 08:22.244
And this morning.
I bumped into
your babe naked.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.330
I told you to stay
out of my bathroom.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.536
l was in the kitchen.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.499
She was naked
in the kitchen?
I was naked.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.716
Why were you naked
in the kitchen?

08:28.800 --> 08:29.960
That's not important
right now.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.838
What is, is why you
didn't want me to meet her
in the first place.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.635
Is she married?
No.

08:34.723 --> 08:35.838
Patient?

08:35.932 --> 08:37.172
I don't have time
for this.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.882
She used to be a man.
House!

08:38.977 --> 08:40.513
She wants to be a man.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.095
Sam is a man's name,
short for...

08:48.778 --> 08:50.109
Samantha.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.773
The soulless harpy
you were married to
before we met.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.358
(SIGHING)

08:56.453 --> 08:58.409
People change, House.

08:58.496 --> 09:02.364
Sure. They get older,
their ovaries start
drying up

09:02.459 --> 09:04.199
and nice guys like you
look attractive again.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.410
Listen, I know
that in your own
demented way,

09:08.631 --> 09:12.749
By "this" you mean
a sinking feeling in
the pit of the stomach.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.584
Fine, | get it.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.591
It's your life,
you go screw it up.
I can wait.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.013
For what?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.431
To tell you,
"I told you so."

09:27.358 --> 09:30.942
No signs of a hematoma.
Brain looks completely normal.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.863
Normal, except for
the fact that he likes
to play dress-up.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.615
My uncle used to pretend
that he was King Leopold.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.488
WILLIAM: (ON INTERCOM)
I’m not pretending.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.991
Sorry about that.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.661
But you don’t really think
you’re a knight, do you?

09:49.756 --> 09:52.839
Being a knight
isn't a game,
it's a lifestyle,

09:52.926 --> 09:56.009
and we do it every day,
not just when
we play dress-up.

09:56.096 --> 10:02.183
We live by a code,
and uphold ideals like
loyalty, courage, humility.

10:02.268 --> 10:06.011
And the part where
you beat the crap out
of each other in armor?

10:06.189 --> 10:09.852
That we do for fun.
At least it was
up until yesterday.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.360
Are we almost done?
I’m feeling...

10:16.366 --> 10:18.357
Let's get him out of there
before he aspirates.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.586
God's teeth!
What strange manner
of garments be these?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.796
Okay. We'll be back soon.

10:37.887 --> 10:42.176
He consorts with tiny
demons in his hand.
'Tis witchcraft, I say.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.883

to play pretend with you?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.227
THIRTEEN: Relax.
It's not personal.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.232
Just tell them
you're a time traveler
or something.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.726
Well, ifwe're gonna
be here, we might
as well enjoy it.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.903
Our knight just vomited
inside the MRI.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.777
Taub thinks it might
be food poisoning.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.363
Which shouldn't
be surprising.

11:06.457 --> 11:10.450
Outdoor latrines,
food prep going on
next to livestock.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.840
I hear you wish
to speak with me
concerning Sir William.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.007
How faireth he?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.336
Not well,
or we wouldn't be here.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.256
A pox indeed is...
Miles.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.600
We just thought
it was a concussion.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.143
He's going to be
okay, right?

11:29.230 --> 11:32.142
We need to look
at the area he was
camping out in.

11:32.233 --> 11:35.566
And you might want
to invest into a dental
plan for the kingdom.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.438
You sure he got sick
from something here?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.114
I'm not sure
of anything,
yet, but...

11:45.121 --> 11:47.203
What do you make of this?

11:49.918 --> 11:52.409
Mmm.
Looks like vomit.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.789
Means he was
showing symptoms
prior to the fight.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.167
True, but I meant this.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.294
Oh. It's a cow eye
from the night before
the tournament.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.221
He makes the knights
eat all kinds of
disgusting stuff.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.388
VVhy?

12:06.476 --> 12:07.841
Got the idea
from Fear Factor.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.892
Why didn't he mention it
when he checked
into the hospital?

12:09.979 --> 12:12.516
I make them all take
an oath of secrecy
about the ritual.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.599
William tends to take
his role as a knight
very seriously.

12:16.611 --> 12:19.694
SHANNON: You think
that's what caused
him to pass out?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.146
(CLEARING THROAT)

12:27.497 --> 12:29.033
It's not exactly sanitary.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.624
Fun stuff never is.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.416
Serious bacterial food
poisoning explains
seizure and vomiting.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.792
A lumbar puncture
could confirm.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.464
Except it's not
food poisoning.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.918
If it was,
the ER would look like
Camelot right now.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.095
All it takes is
one bad eyeball.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.266
Or testicle, cow brain,
or my personal favorite,

12:50.353 --> 12:54.062
pig rectum with a side
order of sphincter.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.431
I think they call that
breakfast in Australia.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.233
HOUSE: No one else was sick
because they weren't
allergic like he was.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.151
To what?
That's what I sent you
to Middle Earth

13:01.239 --> 13:02.649
to find out.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.907
Run scratch tests
with the samples
you brought back.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.700
CHASE:
That's gonna take time,
and he's getting worse.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.244
So treat him with
epinephrine, too.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.750
FOREMAN:
This should prevent
any more symptoms

13:19.841 --> 13:22.127
until we can figure out
what it is you're allergic to.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.503
WILLIAM: Thanks.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.301
I told you,
you shouldn't have
eaten all that stuff.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.424
You know,
you don't have to stay.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.552
I'm sure you and Miles
are crazy busy, what
with the wedding and all.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.508
Miles said we could
postpone it until...

13:32.603 --> 13:36.642
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
I'll be there. Ijust hope
you have a good photographer.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.770
'Cause I don't think
the standard red-eye filter's
going to work on these.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.271
THIRTEEN: I need
your right arm.

That feels...
Feels strange.

(MONITORS BEEPING)

13:54.459 --> 13:55.949
What is it?
What's wrong?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.875
His heart rate's
become irregular.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.169
My chest hurts.
It feels like it's
going to explode.

We need to shock
him back into rhythm.

(PANTING)

14:08.639 --> 14:11.176
What is that?
What is that stuff?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.349
I don't know.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.597
(GASPING)

14:20.943 --> 14:22.274
It's definitely
not an allergy,

14:22.362 --> 14:24.523
or the epi would
have helped him,
not made him worse.

14:24.614 --> 14:29.574
Unless he's allergic
and allergic to the cure.
Sodium bisulfite,

14:29.660 --> 14:33.198
the preservative
that keeps epi peppy,
can cause tachycardia.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.371
So can Wolff-Parkinson-
White syndrome,

14:35.458 --> 14:37.449
and it also causes
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.455
And abnormal electrical
pathways in the heart,
which could cause seizures.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.753
But not skin infections.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.422
There is an infection
that can cause skin
and neurological damage

14:45.510 --> 14:47.546
and spreads rapidly
without treatment.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.720
Methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.298
Lord have MRSA.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.306
You weren't wearing
gloves when we shocked his
heart back into rhythm.

15:00.358 --> 15:04.226
I'm sure you'll be fine.
You two, get a sample
to the lab to confirm.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.357
You get the knight
into isolation and
on IV antibiotics.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.481
You, stay away from me.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.786
Need to talk.
About the MRSA?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.868
I know. We're...
MRSA, shmrsa.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.289
Something important.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.373
Something you think
is more important than
a potentially lethal bacteria

15:26.509 --> 15:29.216
spreading like
wildfire through
my hospital?

15:29.345 --> 15:33.008
Well, that narrows it
down to something
personal and stupid.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.305
Wilson.
Theory confirmed.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.600
He is dating
his first wife,
I know.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.097
I don't believe it.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.937
That he didn't ask
your permission first?

15:42.024 --> 15:45.812
No, that he's actually
capable of keeping
a secret from me.

15:45.903 --> 15:49.020
Well, you'd be surprised
how many things
Wilson doesn't tell you.

15:49.115 --> 15:53.825
Would I? Like how you
slept with your father's
best friend? Or...

15:53.911 --> 15:54.991
I'm going to kill him.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.660
You need to break them up.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.450
Forget it.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.951
So you'd rather
sit back and watch

16:00.042 --> 16:03.375
while the evil blonde
gorges on Wilson's
tender flesh

16:03.463 --> 16:06.580
and then tosses out his bones
like she did the last time?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.627
You remember what
he was like after that?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.217
Yes, I do.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.465
Well, then
do something.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.013
God knows
he's not gonna
listen to me.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.807
You, on the other hand,
have decades of
experience dating

16:18.895 --> 16:21.227
and being attracted
to losers.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.434
Obviously I don't
include myself.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.023
You know what happens when
you interfere in other
people's relationships?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.567
Of course,
I do it all the time.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.229
Hmm. I see your point.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.531
That is why
I'm staying out of this.

16:33.910 --> 16:37.744
You force him to choose,
you might not like the answer.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.917
He doesn't seem
to be in as much
pain anymore.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.130
That's good.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.672
But we won't be out of
the woods for sure until
the blisters start to recede.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.926
I'm really thirsty.
You mind getting me a soda?

16:57.058 --> 16:59.094
Sure.
I'll be right back.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.718
(EXHALING)

17:03.439 --> 17:04.940
What's wrong?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.815
The pain in my chest,
it's getting worse.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.434
Just now?
No.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.149
I didn't want
to worry her.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.361
So how long
have you been
in love with her?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.909
What? No,
we're just friends.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.786
Seriously.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.413
Since the first time
I saw her.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.290
Why don't you tell her?

17:28.422 --> 17:29.628
She's engaged
to my friend.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.875
The King?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.333
Haven't seen him
visiting or sitting
by your bedside.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.970
He has responsibilities.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.712
Yeah? I'm guessing
the Queen does, too.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.265
What kind of knight
steals his friend's bride?

17:42.186 --> 17:44.768
I hate that
I even think about it.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.642
You're not a knight.
You're just a guy.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.944
But I want to be
more than that.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.068
(GASPS)

17:57.159 --> 17:58.490
Your chest?

17:58.578 --> 17:59.909
No, my back.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.487
Feels like there's
a knife in it.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.239
Is the infection spreading?

18:05.334 --> 18:06.585
CHASE: It’s not MRSA.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.878
It looks like
some sort of
clostridial organism.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.961
Question is,
which type of clostridium?
There's hundreds.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.792
C. perfringens?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.880
Wouldn't account for
his other symptoms.
C. tetani, on the other hand?

18:21.017 --> 18:23.429
CHASE: Tetanus?
He would have been
inoculated against it.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.885
So he cut himself
and didn't get
a booster shot.

18:26.022 --> 18:30.061
The guy fights people
with swords for fun,
no one said he's smart.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.773
They don't just
fight for fun.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.522
They fight to prove
their bravery.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.813
You buying this honor stuff?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.737
Fighting is not brave,
it's just stupid.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.656
You would say that.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.870
You think I've never
been in a fight?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.458
No, Ijust think
you've never won one.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.954
I took on three guys
in college once.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.081
HOUSE: Hope they
bought you dinner first.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.208
CHASE: It's not MRSA.
I know.

18:53.341 --> 18:54.831
It's poison ivy.
CHASE: Poison ivy?

18:54.925 --> 18:57.382
A severe reaction
could cause the blisters

18:57.511 --> 18:59.888
and maybe irritate
his eyes enough to cause
the hemorrhaging,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.133
but the chest pain
and seizures?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.964
They have bonfires
every night.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.051
Burning leaves
aerosolizes the oil.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.140
You've seen what
it's done to the
outside of his body,

19:08.230 --> 19:10.437
imagine what
it's doing to his lungs
and his sinuses.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.185
Okay, maybe
it remotely fits,

19:12.276 --> 19:14.858
but I'd rather go with
scientific evidence
than with your gut.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.894
How about this?

19:17.698 --> 19:20.280
Apparently,
it's all over his sword.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.321
(PAGERS BEEPING)

19:24.705 --> 19:26.115
It's his heart rate again!

19:26.248 --> 19:27.749
How fast is it?
It's slowing.
Why aren't you...

19:27.875 --> 19:29.411
It's not MRSA.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.158
I'm giving him 12 cc's
of epinephrine.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.164
He tested positive.
You'll blow his heart out.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.088
If it slows any more,
it's going to stop.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.295

(MONITOR STARTS BEEPING)

19:44.892 --> 19:46.428
(INHALING)

19:47.061 --> 19:48.597
And I told you.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.107
That wasn't caused
by poison ivy.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.352
Or epinephrine.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.813
Means the heart problem
we ruled out, we now
have to rule back in.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.441
We found
clostridium bacteria
in the skin samples.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.784
THIRTEEN:
Clostridium's in dirt
and basically harmless.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.529
But opportunistic,
if his immune system
was depressed.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.410
Leukemia?
He would've had symptoms

20:10.501 --> 20:12.037
way before the
Renaissance festival.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.461
Which is true of anything
that would compromise
his immune system.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.877
Which means it has
to be some other
environmental toxin.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.005
Yesterday he was
a healthy knight, today
he's sleeping beauty.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.344
Nothing else fits.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.212
Trichinosis from
eating infected meat?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.558
We already ruled
out food poisoning.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.509
Both the butcher shop
and the food stands at
the fair were totally clean.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.476
HOUSE: Then he ate
the poison apple
somewhere else,

20:32.481 --> 20:33.766
or maybe you just missed it.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.187

trichinosis and confirm
with a muscle biopsy.

I can't believe
I'm about to say this.
Sam... (SIGHING)

20:51.709 --> 20:53.245
Told you so.

20:53.335 --> 20:57.123
No, she didn't dump me.
She wants to get
to know you better.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.751
Damn it!
I never should have
let her see me naked.

20:59.842 --> 21:03.300

all my instincts,
but I said all right.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.378
She thinks
I was hiding her
from you.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.504
You were.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.931
I don't want
her to know.

21:10.144 --> 21:13.887
You're asking me
to condone a relationship
based on lies and mistrust?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.563
Yeah.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.681
When and where?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.563
Tonight. Venezia. 8:00.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.196
I know you're
worried about me.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.994
And I also know
that that kind
of unselfishness

doesn't come
naturally to you.

I don't need your help.

Just come to dinner
and be your usual
selfish self.

How could I say no?

21:51.352 --> 21:52.808
Miles said
he'd stop by later.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.635
Tell him not to.

be ashamed of.

you want me to leave?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.324
Right. Maybe
when I'm feeling
a little better.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.588
I'm going to take

going to tell her.

but if you ask me,
she's waiting for you to.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.811
Knights are supposed
to be selfless.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.353
Right, they conquered
countries and built castles
by being selfless.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.856
Bravery and loyalty
are great qualities
for soldiers.

22:48.951 --> 22:52.785

23:35.456 --> 23:36.992
It's nice to meet you.
Horace has told me...

23:37.082 --> 23:38.071
House.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.830
House has told me
all about you.

Nice to meet you.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.255
What's the diagnosis?

23:51.138 --> 23:54.847
His muscle biopsy's clean.
It's not trichinosis.

23:55.017 --> 23:58.009
House was wrong.
This is not environmental.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.262
Or we screwed up
and missed something
at the Renaissance fair.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.597
You think we did?

24:02.691 --> 24:05.307
No, but I think
House will think we did.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.693
What could we
have missed?

24:08.530 --> 24:09.736
Fungal infection?

24:10.032 --> 24:13.445
There's nothing
in his blood work even
remotely suggesting that.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.617
But it fits
the symptoms.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.616

been in lately?

And that's relevant how?

24:25.673 --> 24:29.461
Extra pain
means extra cranky,
means off his game.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.712
He's not gonna accept
this isn't environmental

when he was on Vicodin.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.504
You and Thirteen
check out his place.

your time, we'll

it's as good a place
as any to start.

Hey. H y

26:11.070 --> 26:12.230
(SIGHING)

26:12.321 --> 26:14.277
Heard House met Sam.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.237
The first time
he was naked.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.158
The second time,
he brought a transvestite
prostitute to dinner.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.197
Overall,
it could've been worse.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.869
Great.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.241
That's your reaction?

26:27.336 --> 26:28.416
What?

26:28.504 --> 26:30.540
Nudity, prostitutes...

26:31.507 --> 26:33.293
Sorry. Preoccupied.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.301
House said something
to you, didn't he?

26:38.388 --> 26:41.004
No. He didn't.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.345
(SIGHS)

26:51.235 --> 26:54.398
It is a little crazy, though.
I mean, isn't it?

26:54.696 --> 26:56.948
I mean, things seem
to be going great,

26:57.032 --> 26:59.819
but they seemed
to be going great
12 years ago.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.446
The good things
are still good.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.903
She's still smart,
funny, gets me.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.157
And she's less competitive.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.699
Either she's changed
or I've changed,
but either way...

27:10.087 --> 27:11.702
Am I out of my mind?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.716
You never know
what can happen.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.384
Might as well
give it a chance.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.594
Yeah.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.827
See that?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.708

in his medicine cabinet
was dental floss.

Key wasn't on his ring.

28:18.780 --> 28:19.986
You honestly
want to go back

28:20.073 --> 28:23.201
and tell House we didn't
check every square
inch of this place?

28:23.285 --> 28:24.821
Of course not.

Either a secret

29:01.990 --> 29:05.653
or our knight
is a witch.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.757
Our knight is into
some seriously
creepy stuff.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.128
He claims it's
just sugar water,

29:23.220 --> 29:24.960
but we sent the rest down
to the lab for testing.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.215
You think
he poisoned himself?

29:26.348 --> 29:28.760
FOREMAN: It's not poison.
We would have picked
it up in his blood work.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.886
Not if it collected
slowly in his liver

29:31.019 --> 29:33.635
and it all started leaking
into his system at once.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.937
These tumors
that aren't tumors,

29:36.024 --> 29:38.276
what if they're
focal hepatic lesions
filled with blood?

29:38.360 --> 29:41.773
Every time one explodes,
it'd be releasing
another dose.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.784

and eventually coma.

I'm sorry. If I don't
change, I'm gonna feel
like I'm at work all night.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.681
Yeah, I remember.

30:18.775 --> 30:19.855
Is it a problem?

30:20.235 --> 30:21.566
Not at all.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.479
In fact, if we hurry...

30:27.743 --> 30:30.610
We will definitely
not make the 7:30.

if I did all the work,
now, would I?

Plus, I had to

It's my mom's recipe.

I got off the web.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.145
Here's to the Internet.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.723
Where I found
the lamb ragu

31:42.818 --> 31:45.309
and you two found
each other. Again.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.520
Well, it wasn't
just the Internet.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.819
Yeah, more like
divorce, depression,

31:50.909 --> 31:52.820

then the Internet.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.991

31:55.455 --> 31:57.491

now, but if you'd like me
to come along with you...

to leave the two of you?

32:11.388 --> 32:12.924

enough already.

Yeah, James.

who ripped his heart out.

I watched him struggle
for years to overcome
the damage you did,

32:34.870 --> 32:37.111
and there's no way
I'm just gonna let
you reel him back in

32:37.205 --> 32:39.537
so you can do it
all over again.

present in his blood
work or liver biopsy.

And his heart rate
and BP are getting
even more erratic.

back into rhythm twice
during the night.

gotten good value.

I told you there's nothing
here that could've caused
any of his symptoms.

No, you told me
that you couldn't
find anything here

33:57.327 --> 33:58.442

be causing
his symptoms.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.778
And now we're gonna
find something new
because we're in costume?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.614
We looked everywhere.
Tested everything.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.458
Just because
Wilson's acting stupid
doesn't mean we are.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.707
You think he's
making a mistake?

34:09.798 --> 34:12.835
Of course.
But he'll figure it out
sooner or later.

Hopefully after
a few weeks
of great sex.

Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

34:16.805 --> 34:18.341
Wilson's not like us.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.808
He cares too much
about people
and their feelings.

our knight claims
to live by,

to look out for him.

It was just one branch.

35:47.604 --> 35:49.265
You sold it
to Sir William.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.098
No. To the King.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.652

of the environment
you didn't check.

What's going on?
Why can't we see William?

36:12.754 --> 36:17.373

much you used and
how you prepared it.

to William?

No, of course not.

charge, start talking fast.

to testify that you're
the only one he gave it to.

36:31.773 --> 36:34.640
Okay. Yeah,
maybe I bought it
for the food challenge,

36:34.776 --> 36:35.936
but I didn't know
that was hemlock.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.063
If it was for
the challenge,

36:41.574 --> 36:44.190
I'm telling you,
I didn't know. Why would
Iwant to hurt William?

36:44.536 --> 36:47.027
I can think of at
least one reason.

36:47.122 --> 36:51.115

whatever happened,
just tell them the truth.

36:53.670 --> 36:54.955
I swear.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.749
We ran
a gas chromatography
on his blood,

37:00.844 --> 37:02.926
found trace amounts
of piperidine alkaloids.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.627
The main markers
of hemlock intoxication.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.888
Well, the good news is,
we now know what's
wrong with you.

37:08.226 --> 37:12.640
Bad news is, your king's
precious ideals were
just pretend after all.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.814
At least when it comes
to guys who get too
close to his Queen.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.187
It's not true.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.273
I guess you've never
heard the expression,

37:21.364 --> 37:23.571
"Gas chromatography
machines don't lie."

37:23.658 --> 37:25.489
Neither does Miles.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.817
He's the best knight
I've ever known.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.035
That's why
he was chosen king.

37:30.165 --> 37:33.999
Miles is a jealous idiot,
and you're just an idiot.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.284
Something's wrong.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.667
We performed a gastric
lavage and administered
activated charcoal,

37:39.758 --> 37:41.794
but he's getting worse,
not better.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.625
It's been in his
system two days.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.176
We're lucky he's
lasted this long.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.504
If it was hemlock,
he'd either be dead already

37:47.599 --> 37:48.679
or getting better
with treatment.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.132
It's hemlock.
We found it
in his blood.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.306
He may have had
some hemlock,

37:51.394 --> 37:53.680
but it's not
what's killing him.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.935
Don't do it,
whatever you're planning,

38:02.030 --> 38:03.611
especially if you're
gonna use that thing.

in a stone...

extra 'cause of the level
of detail that you wanted.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.578
Anything good?
And by good, I,
of course, mean bad.

Nope. Pretty much
your typical life.

got divorced.

Married a little
less young,
got divorced.

successful in everything
she's done except marriage.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.967
Well, there's gotta be
something I can use.

38:27.055 --> 38:30.764
Maybe. Didn't read
her shrink's notes.
Didn't seem right.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.640
But stealing them did?

38:32.727 --> 38:35.890
Whoa! I didn't steal them.
I found a way to obtain them.

38:36.356 --> 38:40.725
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt,
but you got a minute?

38:40.985 --> 38:42.145
Sure.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.028
Oh, him? Yeah.
lwas just leaving.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.488
Careful, I have a sword.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.414
I don't agree
with what you said,

38:56.501 --> 38:59.117
but I understand
why you said it.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.578
We were married young.
We both made mistakes.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.588
And, yes, I did make
most of them.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.507
But that was almost
a decade ago.

39:06.594 --> 39:10.337
I'm sorry, is that
the statutory period
for soul sucking?

39:11.015 --> 39:13.927
I'm not asking you
to like me, House.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.679
To be honest,
I think you're an ass,

39:15.770 --> 39:18.637
but we do have
one thing in common.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.605
We care about James.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.526
So prove it and
dump him. Again.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.320
You're pretty much
insufferable all the
time, aren't you?

39:27.407 --> 39:29.443
Sorry. Go on. And yes.

39:29.534 --> 39:33.197
We just reconnected,
we have no idea
where we're headed.

39:34.455 --> 39:39.825
But is it really too much
to ask that you give us
a chance to find out?

39:46.801 --> 39:48.792
I'm sure
I'll be seeing
you around.

40:21.002 --> 40:24.085
We did it.
Well, I did it.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.662
What exactly did we do?

40:27.634 --> 40:28.749
You do?

40:28.843 --> 40:30.674
These aren't focal
hepatic lesions
on his liver.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.055
They're peliosis
hepatis lesions,

40:33.139 --> 40:36.381
which, in combination
with an erratic heart rate,
usually indicates...

40:36.476 --> 40:38.762
Endocarditis, an infection
on his heart valve.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.936
Two major symptoms
of anabolic steroid abuse.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.103
No, he wouldn't...

40:43.191 --> 40:44.522
And the rhabdo
makes the third.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.600
Our patient's a juicer.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.482
The ancient poison
accelerated the damage
of the modern poison.

40:51.366 --> 40:54.529
Start treatment.
Let the king
out of the tower.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.995
THIRTEEN:
How are you feeling?

41:03.086 --> 41:04.371
Ashamed.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.416
You should be.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.381
You'll compromise
your ideals
to win a fight,

41:10.468 --> 41:13.175
but not to go for
the woman you love.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.932
That was a game,
not real life.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.132
I didn't...

41:20.228 --> 41:22.219
Hurt anyone?
Try telling that to Shannon.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.680
Or maybe I missed
something while she was
crying by your bed.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.728
You don't need
to win anyone's heart.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.645
You just need
to ask for it.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.581
Miles is a great guy.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.451
He's rich, smart,
treats her well.

41:46.546 --> 41:49.709
She's going to have
a great life with him.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.251
With me?

41:51.342 --> 41:52.502
I'd do everything
I could for her,

41:52.593 --> 41:54.208
but even at my best,
it wouldn't be much.

41:54.303 --> 41:57.170
And she deserves the best.

41:59.767 --> 42:03.510
I guess I'd rather
she be happy, even
if it means I'm not.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.683
Guess House was right
about that, too.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.021
What?

42:11.362 --> 42:13.398
You really are an idiot.
