02:43.210 --> 02:45.327
They'll fight a delaying action.

02:45.383 --> 02:48.465
Twenty-five, thirty warriors, maybe.

02:48.494 --> 02:50.534
Hundred women and children.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.647
That's it.

02:53.662 --> 02:55.726
The warriors will turn and fight.

02:55.751 --> 02:57.807
-No avoiding that.
-No.

02:57.883 --> 03:01.002
It'll give the women and children
time to take cover.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.147
One thing for damn sure,
they already know we're here.

03:08.301 --> 03:10.353
-Captain Ragsdale!
-Sir.

03:11.409 --> 03:13.477
Troopers on the flat, form a line!

03:15.529 --> 03:16.596
Company!

03:39.608 --> 03:41.601
-Mr. Ragsdale!
-Sir!

03:41.610 --> 03:42.651
Advance carbines.

03:42.677 --> 03:45.854
Company! Advance carbines!

03:51.032 --> 03:53.113
-Sound the march.
-Bugler!

04:28.523 --> 04:31.660
The Chiricahua Apache
from the American Southwest...

04:31.706 --> 04:35.829
...were the last of the great tribes
to defy the United States government...

04:35.843 --> 04:38.959
...and its effort to impose
the reservation system.

04:39.021 --> 04:43.170
The Army, under the command
of Brigadier General George Crook...

04:44.197 --> 04:48.364
...was entrusted with the responsibility
of breaking this resistance.

04:49.415 --> 04:53.561
His campaign ended the Chiricahua
strongholds below the Mexican border.

04:53.582 --> 04:55.680
Brought to a conclusion the conflict...

04:55.696 --> 04:58.841
...that had raged through the Southwest
for nearly two decades.

05:03.004 --> 05:06.136
Tell old Nan and the others
we're not going to hurt them.

05:08.196 --> 05:10.257
We're not going anywhere.

05:10.286 --> 05:12.338
We don't want to fight.

05:12.384 --> 05:15.487
We came here to bring you
to our reservation.

05:16.509 --> 05:17.589
Tell your men that.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.760
Nantan Lupan only wants peace
with the Chiricahua.

05:24.892 --> 05:25.956
Live on the reservation.

05:25.964 --> 05:30.093
Only one Chiricahua warrior
and his band of renegades held out.

05:31.119 --> 05:35.268
Then, even he sent word that he would
give himself up in two months time.

05:35.315 --> 05:37.359
He was called Goyakla.

05:37.388 --> 05:40.499
But years before, the Mexicans
had given him another name:

05:41.534 --> 05:42.589
Geronimo.

05:53.049 --> 05:56.136
One month before my 22nd birthday...

05:56.144 --> 05:59.264
...I reported for duty
in the Arizona territory.

05:59.285 --> 06:01.416
It was my first post into garrison life.

06:02.421 --> 06:06.596
In looking back, it is now clear to me
that I was as much a stranger to myself...

06:06.609 --> 06:09.662
...as I was to the great western desert.

06:09.704 --> 06:11.756
My name is Britton Davis.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.931
I was a participant in what the Army
later called the Geronimo Campaign.

06:15.976 --> 06:20.151
It is my wish to throw some light upon
the extraordinary events that I witnessed...

06:20.168 --> 06:22.237
...and on the men that lived them.

06:55.574 --> 06:58.719
The beginning of my life
as a frontier soldier was at hand...

06:58.753 --> 07:02.873
...and no amount of military training
could disguise the excitement I felt.

07:02.886 --> 07:06.027
-Howdy.
-Welcome. It's good to see an army fellow.

07:15.403 --> 07:16.453
Whiskey?

07:17.442 --> 07:18.543
No, thank you, sir.

07:19.536 --> 07:21.609
You don't have to 'sir' me, son.

07:21.617 --> 07:22.722
I ain't no officer.

07:23.757 --> 07:26.885
-Looks like you are, though.
-Second Lieutenant Britton Davis.

07:26.897 --> 07:29.962
-At your service.
-Proud to know you.

07:31.085 --> 07:33.116
Where you from, Lieutenant?

07:33.124 --> 07:35.193
Born in Texas, near Brownsville.

07:35.206 --> 07:38.371
Texas? Why, hell, son,
I thought you was from back east!

07:38.388 --> 07:40.436
Kind of got that manner about you.

07:40.448 --> 07:43.510
Well, I been the last four years
at West Point.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.619
-Senor.
-Yeah?

07:44.628 --> 07:46.671
Soldados vienen.

08:23.129 --> 08:25.310
My initial impression
of First Lieutenant Charles Gatewood...

08:26.257 --> 08:27.400
...remains distinct in my memory.

08:28.396 --> 08:32.613
His brusqueness was entirely military,
balanced by unfailing good manners.

08:33.631 --> 08:36.767
In his most matter-of-fact way,
he gave me my first order...

08:36.780 --> 08:39.866
...as an officer
of the United States Cavalry.

08:39.908 --> 08:41.993
I was to accompany him south.

08:42.969 --> 08:45.051
We were going to bring in Geronimo.

08:46.168 --> 08:48.187
He's due in a few days.

08:48.229 --> 08:52.366
We'll go on down to the border
and escort him to San Carlos.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.644
About 75 miles to the border
from here, Mr. Davis.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.752
Plenty of time to get acquainted
with your new mount.

09:02.764 --> 09:03.865
-Sir?
-Yes?

09:04.904 --> 09:06.922
Just you and me?

09:06.972 --> 09:11.135
The General figured that if we had
Geronimo we didn't need much protection.

09:11.147 --> 09:12.181
Yes, sir.

09:13.245 --> 09:16.386
A small detachment means
we're not threatening the hostiles.

09:17.354 --> 09:20.478
You wouldn't want to pose a threat
to Geronimo, would you?

09:20.486 --> 09:21.553
No, sir.

09:39.267 --> 09:43.442
The Lieutenant was a man of confidence
and experience in the Apache wars.

09:43.501 --> 09:47.600
In time I came to realise
he was much admired by his peers...

09:47.626 --> 09:49.718
...much respected by his superiors.

09:59.116 --> 10:01.202
That's the border, Mr. Davis.

10:03.237 --> 10:06.374
-How will he find us?
-Easy. We're the only ones out here.

10:14.711 --> 10:15.783
Lieutenant?

10:25.134 --> 10:26.248
Apache medicine man.

10:29.355 --> 10:31.424
Probably on a pilgrimage.

10:32.441 --> 10:35.586
The Apaches, they believe in that power.
It's a kind of...

10:35.615 --> 10:37.716
...spirit they carry inside them.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.935
Sir, Geronimo's just going to come on in
and give himself up?

10:43.982 --> 10:46.034
That's what he promised.

10:47.031 --> 10:50.208
Chiricahua doesn't give his word much,
but when he does, he keeps it.

10:50.251 --> 10:52.311
As long as you keep yours.

11:00.582 --> 11:03.756
When the medicine man joined our camp,
I was filled with curiosity.

11:04.782 --> 11:07.976
By personal inclination, Lieutenant
Gatewood kept his own counsel.

11:08.965 --> 11:14.145
He met questions from an inexperienced
officer with patience and courtesy.

11:14.212 --> 11:16.260
What fascinated me most...

11:16.289 --> 11:20.427
...was his sympathy and knowledge
of all things pertaining to the Apache.

11:25.649 --> 11:27.726
You don't talk to them much, do you?

11:27.763 --> 11:29.873
To an Apache, stillness is a pleasure.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.953
It's something they're taught
while they're young.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.062
Helps someone who may have to
hide and wait.

11:38.190 --> 11:40.247
What's he singing about?

11:40.301 --> 11:42.357
Trying to locate Geronimo.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.532
Says he'll be here tomorrow.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.584
On a white horse.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.806
Superstitious, aren't they?

11:54.895 --> 11:57.973
$5 says he rides in here on a white horse.

11:57.981 --> 12:00.096
Just because the medicine man says so?

12:01.122 --> 12:03.190
You've got a bet, Lieutenant.

12:05.247 --> 12:06.305
Question?

12:07.374 --> 12:10.510
These scouts that we have with us,
they're Apache.

12:11.511 --> 12:14.631
Why would they work for the Army?
Fight their own kind?

12:14.639 --> 12:17.833
There are lots of different Apache tribes
that don't much like each other.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.946
Most of all,
Apache go where the best fight is.

12:21.934 --> 12:24.065
It's a morality, once you understand it.

12:26.105 --> 12:29.271
All right, I'll see your $2...

12:30.330 --> 12:32.428
...and I'll raise you $1 .

12:35.481 --> 12:37.621
Lieutenant, just curious:
are you a family man?

12:38.617 --> 12:40.703
I have a son and a daughter.

12:40.715 --> 12:42.838
They and my wife are back in Virginia.

12:43.902 --> 12:47.022
-You must miss them.
-Every hour of every day.

13:43.336 --> 13:45.351
Goyakla is coming.

13:45.363 --> 13:47.411
Rides a white horse.

13:48.517 --> 13:50.602
You owe me $5, Mr. Davis.

14:31.213 --> 14:34.399
I heard you were wearing the blue coat.

14:34.425 --> 14:37.486
I did not believe it.

14:42.746 --> 14:47.976
Now I know your heart.

15:18.156 --> 15:21.276
First Lieutenant Charles P. Gatewood.

15:22.319 --> 15:26.535
It is good to see the great warrior.

15:30.690 --> 15:33.805
You speak pretty good Apache.

15:34.902 --> 15:37.975
Second Lieutenant Britton Davis,
Sixth Cavalry.

15:39.073 --> 15:44.248
You are now under the protection
of the United States Army.

15:44.286 --> 15:49.417
We will escort you
to General Crook at San Carlos.

15:50.509 --> 15:53.608
Nantan Lupan waits for you
with an open heart.

16:09.307 --> 16:11.322
They are something.

16:11.364 --> 16:13.441
Chiricahua are special.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.573
Even amongst the Apache.

16:32.209 --> 16:36.397
The second night of our trek to San Carlos,
we put up at the Overland way station...

16:36.414 --> 16:39.500
...at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains.

16:39.529 --> 16:42.678
The following morning
I had my first opportunity to write home...

16:42.687 --> 16:46.857
...being careful to include in the letter
an offhand reference to my participation...

16:47.804 --> 16:48.922
...in the capture of Geronimo.

17:12.913 --> 17:17.045
Two men are coming.
Man with white hat carries shotgun.

17:36.824 --> 17:38.947
I'm looking for the officer in charge.

17:40.002 --> 17:43.080
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood
at your service.

17:43.118 --> 17:46.225
Heard the Army was travelling through
with hostiles.

17:47.243 --> 17:49.360
Especially one hostile in particular.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.553
City Marshal Joe Hawkins, Tombstone.

17:55.618 --> 17:57.749
Apaches over yonder are under arrest.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.891
I'm deputizing you to hold
these criminals until we get back...

18:01.899 --> 18:03.955
...with a posse and a warrant.

18:04.998 --> 18:07.116
These Apache are in our custody.

18:08.122 --> 18:11.291
The warrant's going to specify
murder of white citizens...

18:13.394 --> 18:17.548
...horse thievery and hostile Indianism.
Now, is that good enough for you?

18:18.562 --> 18:21.686
We want to do what's right,
which is hang them.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.860
I have orders to turn these Apache in
to General Crook.

18:24.868 --> 18:27.921
The United States Army
doesn't need your help.

18:27.929 --> 18:28.984
Lieutenant....

18:29.001 --> 18:31.087
Don't sass me, blue coat.

18:38.415 --> 18:40.488
Great Geronimo.

18:42.506 --> 18:46.681
I think you're nothing
but a murdering red bastard.

18:55.102 --> 18:58.139
I'd ride on if I were you, sir.

18:58.185 --> 19:00.282
You seem to have provoked the hostiles.

19:01.296 --> 19:04.490
And I don't think you want to get
into a contest with the Sixth Cavalry.

19:05.471 --> 19:07.527
Let me tell you something.

19:07.561 --> 19:10.726
Even the Sixth Cavalry is subject
to a Federal warrant.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.846
Justice will be served...

19:14.835 --> 19:15.931
...one way or the other.

19:16.966 --> 19:18.013
Toothy.

19:40.927 --> 19:42.996
Get the Apaches going, Mr. Davis.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.116
Now.

19:46.137 --> 19:47.187
Sir.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.652
We moved north with all possible speed...

19:58.666 --> 20:01.806
...but our pack mules prevented us
from making good progress.

20:01.840 --> 20:07.020
Around 4:00 in the afternoon,
we caught sight of the Tombstone Posse.

20:18.502 --> 20:21.639
Faced with the potential enemy
that possessed superior numbers...

20:21.651 --> 20:24.742
...Lieutenant Gatewood hit upon
an unusual tactic.

20:24.775 --> 20:26.806
He divided his forces.

20:26.819 --> 20:30.960
He sent me ahead with the others,
while he and Geronimo remained behind.

20:30.973 --> 20:33.054
The lieutenant had two objectives.

20:33.067 --> 20:36.183
First, to attempt
a rear-guard protective action.

20:36.237 --> 20:41.392
Second, and most important,
never to lose sight of Geronimo.

20:49.738 --> 20:50.851
Easy, steady!

21:07.464 --> 21:08.577
What you seeing, Davy?

21:09.524 --> 21:10.663
Looks like some of them split off.

21:11.664 --> 21:13.770
Six or seven of them headed
to San Carlos...

21:15.805 --> 21:16.915
...other two up yonder.

21:25.252 --> 21:28.309
That's more of a lynch mob than a posse.

21:31.429 --> 21:34.623
But if they serve those warrants,
I'm going to have to give you up.

21:36.710 --> 21:39.783
You have a good long glass, Gatewood.

21:42.912 --> 21:44.005
If I scare them off...

21:45.068 --> 21:46.118
...we trade.

22:03.741 --> 22:05.847
I can't let you kill any of those men.

22:14.181 --> 22:15.273
That was a great shot.

22:16.274 --> 22:18.384
Not so great, I aimed for his head.

22:50.746 --> 22:53.858
We best catch up to Mr. Davis
and the others now.

23:02.174 --> 23:03.259
This your name?

23:03.271 --> 23:05.282
Gatewood?

23:05.315 --> 23:06.337
Yes.

23:07.388 --> 23:09.461
A gift from my troops.

23:11.584 --> 23:13.644
They must think you're a fine chief.

23:15.688 --> 23:15.791
No.

23:16.781 --> 23:18.904
Not a chief, just a soldier.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.233
Your glass much better than mine.

23:33.464 --> 23:36.600
Blue stone is valuable to Apache.

23:53.234 --> 23:54.310
Well, thank you.

24:18.325 --> 24:21.437
The following afternoon,
we arrived at the military base...

24:21.445 --> 24:23.514
...of operations at San Carlos.

24:23.535 --> 24:26.625
This afforded me my first glimpse
of General Crook...

24:26.642 --> 24:30.783
...who the Apache called Nantan Lupan,
Grey Wolf Chief.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.975
Our arrival was laid out
with great military ceremony.

24:35.017 --> 24:38.141
The surrender of Geronimo
was no small event.

24:41.269 --> 24:42.308
General.

24:43.342 --> 24:45.415
My compliments, Lieutenant.

25:01.085 --> 25:03.112
Nantan Lupan.

25:11.441 --> 25:13.585
It does my heart good
to see you, Geronimo.

25:14.569 --> 25:15.687
I accept your surrender.

25:16.688 --> 25:18.794
I accept the surrender of a great warrior.

25:22.998 --> 25:27.073
Now, let's have a cup of coffee
and smoke a cigar.

25:27.153 --> 25:29.205
Got a lot to talk about.

25:32.345 --> 25:34.381
It's old Geronimo.

25:39.611 --> 25:40.716
Good to see you, ain't it?

25:41.701 --> 25:43.769
You know my friend, Al Sieber.

25:43.853 --> 25:46.977
Yeah. I was always hoping
to catch up to you myself, but...

25:47.994 --> 25:50.104
...I guess I'll never get that chance now.

25:57.391 --> 25:59.489
-Mr. Sieber.
-Lieutenant.

26:08.836 --> 26:11.922
I see you have your cigar and coffee.

26:12.998 --> 26:16.118
Lieutenant Gatewood told me
of your trip up from the border.

26:16.127 --> 26:18.179
Sounds like quite a story.

26:20.327 --> 26:23.396
I'm glad to see that Geronimo's
a man of his word.

26:23.409 --> 26:26.569
Washington's ordered me
to detain you here for a short period...

26:26.600 --> 26:30.775
...and then send you and your band
of Chiricahua on to Turkey Creek.

26:32.781 --> 26:34.850
We keep our rifles for hunting.

26:34.891 --> 26:36.989
Yes, but only on the reservation.

26:37.014 --> 26:39.115
I'll put one of my officers in charge there.

26:40.126 --> 26:41.198
Gatewood.

26:46.394 --> 26:49.493
No, I'm sorry, Lieutenant Gatewood
is a company officer.

26:49.502 --> 26:51.562
He has his responsibilities here.

26:52.588 --> 26:53.689
Then we take Davis.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.767
I like Davis.

26:56.788 --> 26:58.889
I'm sure Mr. Davis will be a fine officer...

26:58.899 --> 27:01.960
...but I had somebody
more experienced in mind.

27:02.027 --> 27:04.054
I like Davis.

27:09.338 --> 27:13.454
-What do you think, Lieutenant?
-I'm sure it will be his privilege...

27:13.505 --> 27:15.528
...as well as his duty.

27:15.553 --> 27:16.654
Mr. Davis, it is.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.782
To be accompanied
by a small detachment of soldiers.

27:20.825 --> 27:24.949
The Apache will be under the protection
of the United States Army.

27:28.078 --> 27:30.113
Mr. Davis is young.

27:30.205 --> 27:34.326
Young Apache, young White-Eye,
the hope of the West.

27:37.454 --> 27:38.526
Gatewood.

27:39.564 --> 27:40.623
You come visit me.

27:41.583 --> 27:42.663
I would like that.

27:43.685 --> 27:45.750
I hope the wars are over, my friend.

27:45.762 --> 27:48.890
Nantan Lupan wants the Chiricahua
to learn to be farmers.

27:48.899 --> 27:49.983
It's their only chance.

27:50.012 --> 27:52.039
They must change.

27:53.053 --> 27:54.154
The old days are gone.

27:56.177 --> 27:59.397
Nantan Lupan says there must be
no leaving this reservation...

28:00.348 --> 28:02.470
...even for a few hours without permission.

28:02.483 --> 28:06.624
There must be no drinking
of whiskey or Tizwin.

28:07.705 --> 28:09.831
Any violations of these rules...

28:10.808 --> 28:13.961
...will result in confinement in an Army
prison stockade.

28:30.607 --> 28:32.688
He want to know why these rules.

28:32.717 --> 28:34.757
Why they be punished?

28:34.782 --> 28:37.902
What you care if Apache drink?
Soldier drink.

28:40.041 --> 28:45.250
Nantan Lupan says
if Apache drink, Apache fight.

28:46.231 --> 28:48.316
Apache get into trouble.

28:48.333 --> 28:49.422
It's bad for everyone.

28:49.451 --> 28:52.521
It's bad for the Apache,
it's bad for soldiers...

28:52.529 --> 28:54.577
...bad for all the White-Eyes.

29:04.003 --> 29:08.124
Say, why, if some Apache do bad things,
all are punished?

29:11.327 --> 29:13.391
That will not happen.

29:16.503 --> 29:20.711
All Apache should not be punished
for the mistakes of only a few.

29:21.758 --> 29:26.901
We will determine who is responsible
and only those few will be punished.

29:41.528 --> 29:45.677
Six weeks after I took up residence
at Turkey Creek, Lieutenant Gatewood...

29:45.690 --> 29:47.776
...and AI Sieber came to visit.

29:47.847 --> 29:53.014
Sieber, as Chief of Scouts, was in charge
of recruiting Apache for the Army.

30:10.753 --> 30:13.869
Hello there, Mangas.
Just the fellow I want to see.

30:15.937 --> 30:18.014
I want you to join the Army, all right?

30:18.023 --> 30:21.151
Wolves with blue coats,
scouts to help us fight the renegades.

30:21.159 --> 30:25.351
You'll be a sergeant, wear a blue coat,
stripes on your coat, with Army pay.

30:26.402 --> 30:28.437
I don't know, Sieber.

30:28.496 --> 30:31.549
Well, you are a warrior. You hunt men.

30:31.557 --> 30:34.673
You'll make your woman,
make your children proud of you.

30:34.727 --> 30:37.859
Mexicans, they took my wife, my little boy.

30:39.949 --> 30:43.010
Maybe the Army could help get them back.

30:48.232 --> 30:49.354
I think maybe I stay here.

30:53.504 --> 30:58.663
If I was asking you out on a raiding party,
I expect you'd be a lot more willing.

31:09.174 --> 31:12.298
Federal government had forced
over 500 Chiricahua...

31:12.306 --> 31:16.385
...to take up residence
within Turkey Creek's narrow borders.

31:16.477 --> 31:21.674
Corn was the main crop, but the land
was not fertile enough to be self-sufficient.

31:22.687 --> 31:27.909
The Chiricahua became dependent on
government supplies for their well-being.

31:30.020 --> 31:33.131
Gatewood. You come to visit me.

31:35.237 --> 31:38.294
Makes my heart glad to see Geronimo.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.525
How's the life of a farmer?

31:43.562 --> 31:45.639
Some Apaches are good farmer.

31:47.729 --> 31:50.799
Others miss the old way.

31:55.016 --> 31:57.093
I'm not good farmer, Gatewood.

32:07.536 --> 32:10.609
I have come here to visit my friend...

32:10.694 --> 32:13.776
...but I have some questions
I need to ask you.

32:14.835 --> 32:18.968
There are rumours that a medicine man
is speaking against the White-Eye.

32:20.078 --> 32:23.210
That he is calling for a return
to the war trail.

32:28.353 --> 32:31.477
It was told by a medicine man...

32:32.503 --> 32:35.648
...many more Apache would die
fighting White-Eye.

32:37.725 --> 32:38.834
And in the end...

32:39.848 --> 32:42.938
...we will win because we will die
free of them.

32:47.134 --> 32:50.225
Is the only way for an Apache to be free...

32:50.312 --> 32:51.354
...to die?

32:57.561 --> 33:00.690
Well, which medicine man is this?
I should talk to him.

33:01.703 --> 33:02.825
Find out what he's saying.

33:05.941 --> 33:07.963
There are many.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.132
Some have the power.

33:11.158 --> 33:13.181
Some just talk.

33:14.207 --> 33:15.287
He's a warrior.

33:15.317 --> 33:17.365
Every bit born in battle.

33:19.462 --> 33:21.515
Fighting a lost cause.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.592
I'm familiar with the type.

33:24.630 --> 33:27.824
My two older brothers and my father
fought for the Army of Northern Virginia.

33:27.854 --> 33:29.898
My oldest brother was killed.

33:30.899 --> 33:32.972
My father was wounded, crippled.

33:35.066 --> 33:38.256
After the war, he took me aside and said,
'You'll carry the new flag.'

33:39.266 --> 33:41.339
Sent me off to the Academy.

33:42.390 --> 33:44.529
First of my family
north of the Mason-Dixon line.

33:46.577 --> 33:49.718
So, like our friend,
I know what it's like to hate the blue coat.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.906
Before the White-Eye came
we had a good life.

33:58.072 --> 34:02.196
Now we are forced to stay
on this tiny piece of land.

34:04.349 --> 34:08.485
The White-Eye do not understand
the way of the Apache.

34:10.583 --> 34:13.713
The medicine man at Cibecue
is called the Dreamer.

34:16.811 --> 34:18.943
He says the dead chiefs will rise.

34:19.965 --> 34:24.119
He says the Apache
are the true keepers of the land.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.295
I will go to him.

34:31.426 --> 34:34.516
I want to hear his words.

34:36.677 --> 34:40.815
Today while Gatewood talked with me,
I looked into my power.

34:43.934 --> 34:46.034
I saw a white horse running.

34:48.076 --> 34:50.132
I saw signs of war.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.566
Nothing so concentrated
the bureaucratic mind...

34:59.575 --> 35:03.746
...in dealing with the Indians as rumours
of a troublesome medicine man.

35:04.759 --> 35:07.867
When a religious leader
showed up among the tribes...

35:07.875 --> 35:12.038
...preaching doctrines perceived to be
dangerous, the government policy...

35:12.046 --> 35:14.206
...was to have the Army
deal with it immediately.

35:39.202 --> 35:42.289
I am here by order of General Crook.

35:42.351 --> 35:44.420
Nantan Lupan.

35:46.459 --> 35:50.668
The dead chiefs
will not rise if you are here.

35:51.748 --> 35:55.906
The White-Eye must leave.
I pray this will happen.

36:15.689 --> 36:19.851
This dance is a demonstration
hostile to the citizens of the United States.

36:20.873 --> 36:24.001
And this demonstration
is unlawfully assembled.

36:24.014 --> 36:26.087
I order you to stop at this instant!

36:31.354 --> 36:32.401
Stop that!

36:33.373 --> 36:34.478
Stop him! Arrest him!

36:45.927 --> 36:46.982
Watch it!

36:51.153 --> 36:55.269
You didn't have to shoot him, goddamn it!
I can handle this myself!

36:55.278 --> 36:57.379
-What's he got there?
-He had a rock!

36:58.486 --> 37:00.550
He has not done nothing!

37:01.514 --> 37:02.640
We're not bothering no one!

37:02.656 --> 37:04.667
You leave here!

37:04.675 --> 37:05.734
You leave us alone!

37:05.751 --> 37:07.858
Arrest him! Arrest Geronimo!

37:09.943 --> 37:12.044
Where is your heart?

37:17.192 --> 37:19.285
Arrest Geronimo! Arrest him!

39:11.911 --> 39:16.023
-David never really--
-General Crook. Telegram, sir.

39:17.103 --> 39:18.180
Pardon me.

39:32.719 --> 39:34.859
Get a staff officer to me immediately.

39:35.839 --> 39:36.977
Captain Ragsdale. Now!

39:49.423 --> 39:50.453
General?

39:50.487 --> 39:52.601
Geronimo's jumped Turkey Creek.

39:53.577 --> 39:54.644
The Apache are out.

39:55.646 --> 39:57.736
It all blew up at Cibecue.

39:58.774 --> 40:00.864
Whole damn thing is a shambles.

40:01.915 --> 40:04.075
Geronimo has taken
half of the reservation with him.

40:04.088 --> 40:06.140
Men, women and children.

40:07.183 --> 40:10.311
Spread the word.
All officers to their commands.

40:10.344 --> 40:11.374
Yes, sir.

40:56.161 --> 40:59.281
Geronimo had quickly divided
his forces into small bands...

40:59.310 --> 41:01.387
...each headed for Mexico.

41:02.405 --> 41:06.559
By the day after Cibecue,
Crook had five columns in the field.

41:07.672 --> 41:09.758
The Geronimo Campaign had begun.

41:10.805 --> 41:12.807
On the point!

41:12.844 --> 41:13.920
Circle back!

41:45.139 --> 41:46.181
Sir?

41:46.240 --> 41:48.321
Yes, I see them, Mr. Davis.

41:48.355 --> 41:50.382
Steady in the rank.

41:50.390 --> 41:51.457
Go slow.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.034
Beg your pardon, sir.

42:06.018 --> 42:07.082
Do we attack?

42:07.098 --> 42:09.117
Hold the column.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.200
Sergeant!

42:10.214 --> 42:11.294
Steady in the rank!

42:12.241 --> 42:13.305
Steady!

42:55.059 --> 42:57.174
-Sergeant.
-Column halt!

43:17.965 --> 43:20.100
Whatever happens,
the Apache will take off.

43:21.072 --> 43:23.158
Don't let the column pursue at speed.

43:23.204 --> 43:26.340
Whenever you can,
you choose your ground to fight on.

43:58.627 --> 43:59.668
Chato?

43:59.728 --> 44:01.796
What the hell is going on?

44:02.772 --> 44:04.945
Raiding party, split off from Goyakla.

44:05.955 --> 44:09.058
Apache challenge Gatewood
to come out and fight.

44:09.120 --> 44:12.232
Want to show off power
to other Chiricahua.

46:06.938 --> 46:07.980
Chato.

46:13.153 --> 46:15.262
Is there anything that should be done?

47:05.330 --> 47:09.422
Geronimo's band had gone east
into the copper mining country...

47:09.430 --> 47:10.510
...of the low hills.

47:10.527 --> 47:13.647
His tactics were re-supply
at the expense of the civilians...

47:13.655 --> 47:15.761
...who had settled on Chiricahua land.

47:43.873 --> 47:45.925
This is Apache land.

47:45.971 --> 47:49.049
This has always been Apache land!

47:49.086 --> 47:52.214
We ain't never done nothing to you.
I mean, it ain't right.

47:52.223 --> 47:54.279
Stop crying, damn it!

47:54.333 --> 47:56.385
He's going to kill you anyway.

47:58.433 --> 48:00.514
We make things out of this country!

48:00.531 --> 48:03.713
There was nothing here before us,
there'd be nothing if we left it to you.

48:25.614 --> 48:27.650
You are a fool...

48:28.743 --> 48:30.835
...but at least you are brave.

48:32.897 --> 48:34.957
Get off Apache land.

48:35.983 --> 48:39.090
The next time, I will kill you.

48:52.671 --> 48:53.763
Detail halt!

48:53.776 --> 48:56.871
-Troops, right, straight!
-Left, right, face.

49:25.032 --> 49:28.164
'The Apache known as
Dandy Jim and Skip-Hey...

49:28.185 --> 49:32.309
'...have been found guilty by the
Military Court, Department of Arizona...

49:32.319 --> 49:34.408
'...of insurrection at Cibecue Creek.

49:35.397 --> 49:36.527
'The Apache Dead Shot...

49:37.528 --> 49:41.674
'...Sergeant, Military Scouts,
Sixth Cavalry...

49:42.767 --> 49:44.848
'...been found guilty of treason.

49:45.874 --> 49:48.981
'The sentence of the court
for the three prisoners...

49:49.006 --> 49:51.042
'...is death by hanging.'

49:54.174 --> 49:56.334
Do any of you have anything
to say to me as Chaplain?

49:57.385 --> 49:59.450
Are any of you Christians?

50:02.536 --> 50:03.600
Nantan Lupan...

50:05.656 --> 50:06.766
...I give you my hat.

50:07.792 --> 50:11.907
Maybe you think my wife, my baby.

50:21.339 --> 50:24.417
Don't trust the White-Eye.

50:28.579 --> 50:30.697
With them there is no right way.

50:33.884 --> 50:36.979
I am not afraid of their preacher.

50:39.040 --> 50:42.134
The One God will welcome me.

52:30.614 --> 52:31.706
There's three of them.

52:32.703 --> 52:34.780
The driver should be nearby.

52:37.883 --> 52:41.012
They didn't have to kill them
just to get their horses.

52:41.091 --> 52:43.114
No, they didn't.

53:10.203 --> 53:13.372
AI Sieber had had his wound
from Cibecue cauterised with a hot poker...

53:13.386 --> 53:16.464
...and was back in the saddle
the following day.

53:16.472 --> 53:19.579
All told, he had suffered
17 gunshot and arrow wounds...

53:19.592 --> 53:21.701
...in his many years of fighting Apache.

53:21.744 --> 53:24.851
The General wants to deploy me
and Dutchy to your column.

53:29.014 --> 53:31.049
How's that wound, Mr. Sieber?

53:31.062 --> 53:32.125
Which one?

53:32.138 --> 53:34.206
Down here, here, here, here?

53:34.248 --> 53:37.360
Hell, I'm in real good.
Ain't slowing me down none.

53:38.348 --> 53:41.497
We came across an overland.
Four dead, horses gone.

53:42.561 --> 53:44.692
If they've burned
two spreads off to the west...

53:45.664 --> 53:48.796
...they've picked up horses,
food, a lot of ammunition.

53:49.818 --> 53:51.987
I figure I'll just keep tracking off
to those hills there.

53:55.031 --> 53:56.087
All right.

53:56.095 --> 53:59.211
Mr. Davis, you and Sergeant Mulrey
stick with Mr. Sieber.

54:00.253 --> 54:02.388
Be sure that he gets back
to the column by sundown.

54:02.397 --> 54:03.439
Yes, sir.

54:29.462 --> 54:30.579
That raiding party is real close.

54:31.580 --> 54:32.630
Yup.

54:36.777 --> 54:38.850
I want you to ride for the column.

54:38.859 --> 54:40.956
Bring them back to pick up this trail.

54:40.965 --> 54:44.038
On the double, pronto, go on,
get out of here!

55:18.444 --> 55:19.562
You take him!

56:37.765 --> 56:41.897
The hostile Apache that Dutchy and I
had been pursuing had gotten away.

56:41.927 --> 56:45.014
Needless to say, at the time,
I was humiliated.

56:45.039 --> 56:48.205
But much later I decided the incident
had come out for the best.

56:49.164 --> 56:52.388
I'm quite content to go to my grave
knowing that I've never killed an Apache.

56:55.445 --> 56:56.550
You all right, Mr. Sieber?

56:59.608 --> 57:01.734
Caught up with three bucks
and some stolen ponies.

57:02.744 --> 57:05.868
Gave one of them to Mr. Davis.
Seems he got away.

57:07.945 --> 57:11.082
Sergeant Mulrey,
check the area for a dead hostile!

57:11.090 --> 57:12.128
Sir!

57:17.375 --> 57:19.452
Now, we crossing to Mexico tomorrow?

57:19.461 --> 57:20.502
That's right.

57:21.546 --> 57:23.632
We ought to send some
of the scouts back.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.749
I don't trust them south of the border.

57:26.697 --> 57:28.854
Geronimo's got a few of them spooked.
They're wondering...

57:28.862 --> 57:30.906
...if they're on the wrong side.

57:30.914 --> 57:32.974
I don't think so, Mr. Sieber.

57:34.025 --> 57:36.126
Besides, we need every scout we have.

57:38.205 --> 57:39.235
Yes, sir.

57:42.338 --> 57:45.466
I guess you weren't there then,
when Dead Shot and the others...

57:45.474 --> 57:46.588
...turned on us at Cibecue.

57:47.576 --> 57:50.684
If I had been at Cibecue,
they wouldn't have turned.

57:50.730 --> 57:52.844
Whole thing wouldn't have happened, Al.

57:53.870 --> 57:57.991
I know you don't like me much
and I don't really care.

57:58.033 --> 58:00.159
I know I'm rough in some of my ways,
I guess.

58:01.157 --> 58:03.221
I ain't the gentleman type.

58:03.288 --> 58:05.357
But, I think...

58:06.362 --> 58:08.480
...compared to you, I am somewhat honest.

58:08.506 --> 58:12.581
No offence intended, Lieutenant.
Speaking off the record, sir.

58:12.677 --> 58:15.763
I just figure you're a real sad case.

58:16.776 --> 58:18.891
You don't love who you're fighting for...

58:18.920 --> 58:21.993
...and you don't hate
who you're fighting against.

58:22.011 --> 58:25.188
Perhaps I could learn to hate
with the proper vigour from you, Al.

58:26.182 --> 58:28.250
Well, maybe you could, Lieutenant.

58:38.652 --> 58:41.785
Though I never managed to become
a close friend of AI Sieber...

58:41.810 --> 58:45.001
...in the next few weeks of campaigning,
I did learn to get along with him.

58:45.947 --> 58:49.084
Only a fool would fail
to profit from his vast experience.

58:49.171 --> 58:52.233
In his own way,
he was as taken by the Apache...

58:52.241 --> 58:54.306
...as was Lieutenant Gatewood.

58:55.390 --> 58:56.440
Well, sir...

58:56.454 --> 59:00.594
...your Apache rides a horse to death
and eats him and steals another.

59:01.588 --> 59:03.697
I mean, the horse is just mobile food.

59:04.762 --> 59:07.939
I've chased them when they made
50 miles a day on horse and foot.

59:08.908 --> 59:12.073
Hell, they can live on cactus,
go 48 hours without water.

59:13.129 --> 59:16.240
I mean, one week of that would kill
your average trooper.

59:18.359 --> 59:21.407
I hear you can track
as good as any Apache.

59:22.530 --> 59:27.668
That's right, but there's only one of me
and 1,000 square miles of Apache country.

59:27.731 --> 59:31.868
General Crook figured that out, 'cause
it takes an Apache to catch an Apache.

59:31.877 --> 59:33.994
White-Eyes can't catch them alone, no sir.

59:42.262 --> 59:46.466
If you ever fight an Apache and things
go bad, save the last bullet for yourself.

59:46.474 --> 59:48.606
You don't want to get taken alive, no sir.

59:50.616 --> 59:52.722
They got lots of ways to kill you.

59:52.739 --> 59:56.877
One of their favourites is to strip you,
tie you upside down to a wagon wheel.

59:56.885 --> 59:59.975
They pour pitch on you, light you on fire.

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:03.622
I know you are angry about this war.

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.806
The White-Eye...

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.023
...gave me no choice.

01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:17.215
I ask your blessing.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:25.485
You ask my blessing
after this thing is done.

01:01:29.694 --> 01:01:31.795
What I did is right.

01:01:36.005 --> 01:01:41.122
Now we are fighting
Mexicans and White-Eye.

01:01:45.293 --> 01:01:49.518
The reservation is bad,
but at least we can stay alive.

01:01:52.651 --> 01:01:55.762
We have fought the Mexicans for years...

01:01:57.806 --> 01:01:59.975
...and the White-Eye will never catch us.

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:08.250
Many Apache will die.
I must send for Nantan Lupan.

01:02:10.385 --> 01:02:13.480
We will talk with him.
I ask that you do this.

01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:28.082
General Crook and a small detachment
of Apache scouts...

01:02:28.115 --> 01:02:31.252
...came across the border
into the Canyon de los Embudos.

01:02:32.253 --> 01:02:36.382
Crook had agreed to negotiate terms,
but he intended a hard bargain.

01:02:36.474 --> 01:02:40.614
For the rest of his life, he never forgave
Geronimo for jumping Turkey Creek.

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.776
Crook maintained his sympathy
for the Apache...

01:02:44.753 --> 01:02:47.893
...but between he and Geronimo
all trust had vanished.

01:02:48.919 --> 01:02:52.060
There is one God looking down on us all.

01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:56.214
We are all children of one God.

01:02:56.281 --> 01:02:58.374
I didn't come here to listen to religion.

01:02:59.334 --> 01:03:00.418
You broke your word.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.522
You left Turkey Creek.

01:03:03.555 --> 01:03:06.704
You killed many White-Eye.
You come back.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.877
Washington wants you to go to Florida.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:17.081
You do it or I'll come back
with my army and fight.

01:03:19.204 --> 01:03:21.305
Nantan Lupan does not understand.

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:26.465
The White-Eye try to change Apache way.

01:03:27.533 --> 01:03:30.606
The Apache were doing fine farming corn.

01:03:42.173 --> 01:03:44.241
The problem was Geronimo.

01:03:45.234 --> 01:03:47.374
I knew Cochise, he was a king.

01:03:49.422 --> 01:03:51.528
He was a wise ruler of his people.

01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:54.664
I knew Vittorio, he was a proud leader.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:57.751
And I know Geronimo.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.884
He doesn't want to lead or rule or be wise.

01:04:01.913 --> 01:04:03.974
He just wants to fight.

01:04:07.189 --> 01:04:09.275
I didn't start this trouble.

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:12.402
The Army killed the Dreamer.

01:04:13.441 --> 01:04:15.502
He was calling for war.

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:19.689
If the medicine man had come in
peaceably, he'd be alive.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:24.853
There's no excuse for taking up arms
against the United States Army.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.996
The Army's the best friend
the Chiricahua ever had.

01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:29.036
You know it and I know it.

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:33.211
With all this land,
why is there no room for the Apache?

01:04:35.317 --> 01:04:38.404
Why does the White-Eye want all land?

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:57.206
How long in Florida?

01:05:00.284 --> 01:05:03.412
Maybe two years, with your families.

01:05:06.615 --> 01:05:08.680
I think I can get that.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.758
That's not a bad deal.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:16.004
A lot of White-Eyes want to see
Geronimo hanged for murder.

01:05:17.001 --> 01:05:18.034
Not murder.

01:05:18.098 --> 01:05:19.145
War.

01:05:20.187 --> 01:05:23.240
Many bad things happen in war.

01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:28.437
How many White-Eye did you kill
since you left Turkey Creek?

01:05:28.483 --> 01:05:29.555
Maybe 50.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.655
Maybe more.
How many Apaches do you kill?

01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:35.761
You killed women and children.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:36.850
So did you.

01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:40.987
We gain nothing by fighting.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:43.106
We can live on the reservation.

01:05:44.103 --> 01:05:45.183
I go there.

01:05:47.223 --> 01:05:48.315
You, Nantan Lupan...

01:05:49.342 --> 01:05:51.389
...are like a brother to me.

01:06:25.853 --> 01:06:28.931
Many of my people want to surrender.

01:06:40.409 --> 01:06:41.506
When I was young...

01:06:43.529 --> 01:06:46.665
...the White-Eye came
and wanted the land of my people.

01:06:48.788 --> 01:06:52.984
When their soldiers burnt our villages,
we moved to the mountains.

01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:57.122
When they took our food...

01:06:58.119 --> 01:06:59.236
...we ate thorns.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.374
When they killed our children...

01:07:04.371 --> 01:07:05.488
...we had more.

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:09.638
We killed all White-Eye that we could.

01:07:12.758 --> 01:07:15.849
We starved and we killed...

01:07:17.918 --> 01:07:19.027
...but in our hearts...

01:07:20.016 --> 01:07:21.142
...we never surrendered.

01:07:35.664 --> 01:07:38.788
C.S. Fly, a photographer from Tombstone...

01:07:38.813 --> 01:07:41.946
...requested permission
to accompany General Crook to Mexico...

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.040
...and record the negotiations.

01:07:44.077 --> 01:07:47.189
Much to everyone's surprise, Crook agreed.

01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:51.333
Even more surprising, Geronimo
and the other Chiricahua also agreed.

01:07:52.327 --> 01:07:55.472
In some mysterious way, they seemed
to understand these pictures...

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.577
...would make them immortal.

01:07:56.585 --> 01:08:00.684
They are the only known photos
ever taken of the American Indian...

01:08:00.698 --> 01:08:02.807
...as an enemy in the field.

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:36.183
Old Nana and his people...

01:08:39.345 --> 01:08:42.384
will return to Turkey Creek.

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:51.761
Many of his people are too old to fight.

01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:59.152
Nantan Lupan
will make all of you a prisoner.

01:09:06.368 --> 01:09:08.474
We have to trust him.

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:17.863
There is no other way.

01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:23.046
I called him my brother.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:33.478
Go if you must. I have made my decision.

01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:39.725
I will not surrender to the White-Eye.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:47.095
I will stay with you and fight.

01:09:50.212 --> 01:09:53.331
But now we will be very few.

01:11:25.102 --> 01:11:29.240
'Thereby I tender my resignation
as commander of this department.

01:11:29.273 --> 01:11:33.431
'I have served you well in the past, but my
judgment has been called into question.

01:11:34.478 --> 01:11:37.631
'Without doubt, I made an error
in trusting the word of Geronimo...

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.692
'...that he would surrender.

01:11:40.726 --> 01:11:43.871
'Perhaps others will be more correct
or more fortunate.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:48.017
'The real tragedy
I know you do not understand:

01:11:49.022 --> 01:11:51.115
'That is, to the Apache people.

01:11:52.158 --> 01:11:54.319
'They have lost in me a true friend...

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.494
'...and they have few.

01:12:00.538 --> 01:12:03.662
'George Crook,
Brigadier General, United States Army.'

01:12:05.797 --> 01:12:08.917
I was forced to send this
to Washington a day ago.

01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:14.105
They've accepted my resignation...

01:12:15.102 --> 01:12:16.183
...with regrets.

01:12:17.225 --> 01:12:20.303
General Nelson Miles will replace me.

01:12:21.384 --> 01:12:23.469
There's nothing to be done, General?

01:12:24.495 --> 01:12:25.562
Nothing.

01:12:27.627 --> 01:12:31.827
Graceful retirement for a general
who could not catch Geronimo.

01:12:33.884 --> 01:12:37.083
Settlers, prospectors,
land speculators, they won't admit it...

01:12:38.084 --> 01:12:41.224
...but the truth is they'd all like to see
the Indian dead.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.310
They see the Army as their weapon.

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:48.481
The Army that fight the Apache is
the only hope of keeping the Apache alive.

01:12:48.548 --> 01:12:50.613
Only the Army can protect them.

01:12:50.634 --> 01:12:52.644
Yes, sir.

01:12:53.749 --> 01:12:55.805
I fought them a long time, General...

01:12:55.814 --> 01:12:59.938
...and I figure if I was one of them,
I'd be standing next to Geronimo...

01:12:59.947 --> 01:13:01.065
...shooting at the blue coats.

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:05.140
But God made me who I am
and between them or us...

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:06.241
...I figure it's us.

01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:09.344
Well, damn it, Al.
Is that the only way we could win?

01:13:09.382 --> 01:13:13.502
Well, I can't answer that question.
I'm just a hired hand.

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:16.610
I just want to say,
I didn't always agree with you...

01:13:16.618 --> 01:13:17.723
...but you had my respect.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.805
And while you was in charge...

01:13:20.868 --> 01:13:22.961
...the Army was a proper piece of work.

01:13:24.993 --> 01:13:26.035
Sir.

01:13:28.146 --> 01:13:33.289
So, I'm going to quit this damn fool job.
I'm going to go on down to Tucson and...

01:13:34.357 --> 01:13:35.474
...I'm going to get drunk.

01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:38.582
Take it easy, Al.

01:13:38.598 --> 01:13:39.632
Yes, sir.

01:13:41.726 --> 01:13:43.758
Al.

01:14:24.436 --> 01:14:28.598
General Miles brought with him
an entirely new staff of line officers.

01:14:28.636 --> 01:14:31.700
Lieutenant Gatewood,
myself and many others...

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.889
...had to taste the humiliation
of being dismissed from the field.

01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:41.086
I'm honoured to be here
with you men of the Sixth Cavalry.

01:14:42.128 --> 01:14:45.294
Honoured to be here by the order
of the President of the United States.

01:14:46.354 --> 01:14:50.533
We are charged with bringing in
the renegade Apache, Geronimo.

01:14:52.535 --> 01:14:54.716
We will accomplish this task.
We will succeed.

01:14:55.713 --> 01:14:59.880
But we're abandoning
certain practices of the past:

01:15:00.876 --> 01:15:03.049
Over reliance on Apache scouts.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:06.152
Men of divided loyalties.

01:15:07.191 --> 01:15:11.328
I will keep troops in the field
until the enemy is fully subjugated...

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:13.410
...fully pacified.

01:15:14.452 --> 01:15:17.621
There will be no compromise
with the honour of our nation.

01:15:18.657 --> 01:15:22.836
There will be no compromise
with the honour of the United States Army.

01:15:25.947 --> 01:15:26.964
Captain.

01:16:22.254 --> 01:16:25.378
As he had promised,
General Miles sent troops forward...

01:16:25.386 --> 01:16:27.475
...without the Apache scouts.

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:30.620
For the next five months,
they relentlessly searched...

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.727
...but the results were predictable.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.858
Geronimo and his tiny band of Chiricahua...

01:16:36.831 --> 01:16:39.938
...had vanished deep
into the mountains of Mexico.

01:16:40.009 --> 01:16:44.105
It seemed they were chasing a spirit
more than a man.

01:16:57.689 --> 01:16:58.782
Lieutenant.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.924
I doubt if you're enjoying
your current assignment.

01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:07.107
Nothing personal,
I understand you're a fine officer.

01:17:13.376 --> 01:17:15.482
Do you know why
I called you here, Gatewood?

01:17:16.479 --> 01:17:17.529
No, sir.

01:17:18.552 --> 01:17:21.650
Tomorrow a new policy change
will be announced.

01:17:22.718 --> 01:17:24.853
As punishment for Geronimo's resistance.

01:17:25.825 --> 01:17:30.034
All Chiricahua living on reservation land
are to be rounded up and sent to Florida.

01:17:30.059 --> 01:17:34.155
They will stay there
until Geronimo is captured or killed.

01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:37.383
That's a harsh penalty
that he's drawn on his own people.

01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:45.679
I hear you and Geronimo were friendly.

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.876
Any relationship I've had has never
compromised my effectiveness in the field.

01:17:51.952 --> 01:17:55.016
I need you to speak freely with me.

01:17:56.127 --> 01:17:58.236
Can you find Geronimo, talk to him?

01:18:00.222 --> 01:18:01.323
I thought so once.

01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:04.464
There's no way to be sure now.

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:07.613
The signs are that he's starving,
or close to it.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.746
Living on cactus and rabbits.

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:15.901
I know this because I've got
observation points...

01:18:15.909 --> 01:18:18.049
...and 5,000 troops
stretched from here to Sonora...

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:19.074
...searching for--

01:18:19.083 --> 01:18:21.114
Thirty-five Apache, sir.

01:18:22.215 --> 01:18:25.327
That's what I believe he'll be down to
in a month's time.

01:18:25.335 --> 01:18:28.388
Thirty-five starving Apache.

01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:32.584
Begging the General's pardon, sir,
but why not leave him to the Mexicans?

01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:36.742
He can't continue to keep raiding
across the border.

01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:40.912
He can't afford to lose any more warriors,
can't replace them.

01:18:45.063 --> 01:18:48.224
The present political situation
demands results.

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:54.468
I want you to find Geronimo
and make him this proposal.

01:18:58.631 --> 01:19:01.838
I have the authority to hunt him
all the way to South America if I have to...

01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:03.919
...but I want this nonsense to end.

01:19:06.005 --> 01:19:09.116
Now, I'm willing to give you
all the scouts you need...

01:19:10.092 --> 01:19:13.308
...hundred-man detail, regular cavalry,
mule pack team.

01:19:14.259 --> 01:19:15.389
A hundred men won't do.

01:19:16.378 --> 01:19:17.470
How many do you want?

01:19:20.532 --> 01:19:21.574
Three.

01:19:22.634 --> 01:19:24.707
I'd like to pick them myself.

01:19:28.894 --> 01:19:30.955
Whatever happens, Lieutenant...

01:19:31.026 --> 01:19:35.184
...this conversation that you and I
are having never took place.

01:19:36.248 --> 01:19:40.352
Any negotiations with Geronimo
are to be strictly confidential.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.440
Is that understood?

01:19:44.535 --> 01:19:46.600
Two years in Florida.

01:19:48.718 --> 01:19:50.841
Two years in Florida, with their families.

01:19:52.848 --> 01:19:56.030
And when they return to reservation land
here in Arizona territory...

01:19:56.055 --> 01:19:59.179
...every warrior gets 40 acres of land...

01:20:00.234 --> 01:20:02.274
...two mules.

01:20:07.462 --> 01:20:10.628
I don't think you or the government
intend to keep this promise.

01:20:11.625 --> 01:20:13.789
You just offer it.
None of the rest is your concern.

01:20:18.928 --> 01:20:21.046
Do you know your scripture, sir?

01:20:22.123 --> 01:20:25.205
'What does it profit a man
to gain the whole world...

01:20:26.293 --> 01:20:28.350
'...and lose his soul?'

01:20:32.504 --> 01:20:33.576
Lieutenant.

01:20:37.672 --> 01:20:38.798
You have your orders.

01:20:53.396 --> 01:20:57.525
Lieutenant Gatewood chose the Apache
scout, Chato, to accompany him...

01:20:57.554 --> 01:21:01.721
...as well as myself and AI Sieber,
who became bored with his retirement.

01:21:01.746 --> 01:21:06.888
After four weeks of tracking Geronimo
through the mountains of Sonora...

01:21:06.926 --> 01:21:10.058
...we came across a burning Indian village.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.198
What we found there was unspeakable.

01:21:57.018 --> 01:21:59.078
There's two dead women there.

01:22:00.108 --> 01:22:01.175
Two little kids.

01:22:02.214 --> 01:22:05.271
Scalped them all, all four of them.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.416
Bounty hunters.

01:22:11.536 --> 01:22:14.660
Government down here pays
200 pesos a head for the men.

01:22:14.673 --> 01:22:15.745
100 for the women...

01:22:16.812 --> 01:22:18.844
...and 50 for those kids.

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:21.997
Kill any Indian, then claim they're Apache.

01:22:22.005 --> 01:22:24.120
I don't see how any man can sink that low.

01:22:24.128 --> 01:22:28.199
Must be Texans,
lowest form of white man there is.

01:22:46.025 --> 01:22:49.107
Who are these people?

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:53.270
They are Yaqui, not Apache.

01:22:56.364 --> 01:23:00.623
The dying Yaqui told me
five White-Eye and a Comanche...

01:23:02.616 --> 01:23:05.740
They attacked before dawn.

01:23:14.103 --> 01:23:16.188
Most of the men got away.

01:23:17.273 --> 01:23:19.333
They go up into the hills...

01:23:20.338 --> 01:23:22.456
...and come back one day, maybe two.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.564
And come back for their families.

01:23:25.635 --> 01:23:29.739
And build big fire and burn the bodies.

01:23:30.832 --> 01:23:33.969
And they go join up
with other Yaqui tribe...

01:23:35.007 --> 01:23:37.097
...maybe find new wives.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:46.502
They go off that way into the hills.

01:23:47.478 --> 01:23:50.627
After they hunt Yaqui men
they go to Soyapos...

01:23:51.674 --> 01:23:52.741
...get their money.

01:23:58.939 --> 01:24:03.176
You and Sieber, I want you to track
the bounty hunters that did this.

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.297
Geronimo is here.

01:24:34.412 --> 01:24:36.544
You want me to ride? I'm ready--

01:24:42.767 --> 01:24:44.873
You need more rest...

01:24:50.078 --> 01:24:53.143
The women have gathered medicine.

01:24:57.319 --> 01:24:59.417
Do we leave at dawn?

01:25:03.654 --> 01:25:05.731
Don't worry.

01:25:06.761 --> 01:25:09.856
We will not fight tomorrow.

01:25:11.962 --> 01:25:14.019
Sleep.

01:26:05.166 --> 01:26:09.315
I have just seen my power.
An iron horse comes over the desert.

01:26:12.448 --> 01:26:16.569
I have seen a vision.
An iron horse for the Apache.

01:26:29.106 --> 01:26:30.207
Been down here...

01:26:31.242 --> 01:26:33.306
...almost 20 years.

01:26:36.372 --> 01:26:37.481
I was in the war.

01:26:40.568 --> 01:26:42.628
Confederate officer.

01:26:45.752 --> 01:26:46.887
After the hostilities ended...

01:26:48.947 --> 01:26:51.007
...I went to Texas.

01:26:52.042 --> 01:26:54.148
Got into a little scrape with the law.

01:26:55.161 --> 01:26:57.305
Come down here, got a new name.

01:27:00.358 --> 01:27:01.439
New start.

01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:03.515
Wife.

01:27:04.567 --> 01:27:05.630
Family.

01:27:11.849 --> 01:27:12.925
But in my heart...

01:27:15.995 --> 01:27:17.067
...well, hell...

01:27:19.115 --> 01:27:21.204
...I'm still a Tennessee man.

01:27:24.374 --> 01:27:26.455
My wife and her sisters...

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.625
...they trade with Apache women.

01:27:30.643 --> 01:27:32.744
They come down from the mountains.

01:27:33.775 --> 01:27:35.865
They've done it for years.

01:27:41.078 --> 01:27:44.236
Few days back,
some Chiricahua showed up near here.

01:27:50.458 --> 01:27:51.489
Where?

01:27:53.562 --> 01:27:56.706
Straight up Montana Avarripe.

01:28:17.519 --> 01:28:19.650
I didn't expect to see
many Americans down here.

01:28:21.677 --> 01:28:23.803
-Where you fellows from?
-Texas.

01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:26.970
I keep a house in Brewster county.

01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:30.022
Awful far from home, ain't you?

01:28:30.081 --> 01:28:34.230
Well, we just came down here
to try to make ourselves a living.

01:28:36.288 --> 01:28:37.385
And what about you, friend?

01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:41.493
It seems like you've got
a real curious nature.

01:28:41.543 --> 01:28:44.638
-You the law?
-Me? Hell, no.

01:28:45.672 --> 01:28:47.820
I'm just hunting
that son of a bitch Geronimo.

01:28:48.867 --> 01:28:52.008
Thought you might've come across
something to help me out.

01:28:53.004 --> 01:28:54.080
I'm sorry, amigo.

01:28:55.102 --> 01:28:57.171
We ain't seen nothing.

01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:14.872
Apache!

01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:19.114
Why don't you sit down there,
while we have us a drink.

01:29:20.152 --> 01:29:23.209
We'll take real good care of you.

01:29:42.041 --> 01:29:44.072
Cover my back.

01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:48.239
Anything happens, fire.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.384
And keep firing.

01:29:52.485 --> 01:29:53.518
Sir.

01:30:17.443 --> 01:30:18.544
That Apache is with us.

01:30:20.621 --> 01:30:22.690
Don't look like it to me.

01:30:24.742 --> 01:30:25.839
He's a Sergeant of Scouts...

01:30:26.869 --> 01:30:28.921
...in the United States Army.

01:30:30.018 --> 01:30:32.037
Who the hell are you?

01:30:32.045 --> 01:30:33.134
Charles Gatewood.

01:30:34.135 --> 01:30:36.203
Lieutenant, Sixth Cavalry.

01:30:37.279 --> 01:30:39.336
You boys are out of uniform.

01:30:40.378 --> 01:30:41.496
Maybe he ought to wear one.

01:30:42.518 --> 01:30:45.613
Somebody down here
take that scalp of his...

01:30:46.655 --> 01:30:48.770
...make themselves a little money.

01:30:51.869 --> 01:30:55.046
Ten days ago,
we came across a Yaqui village.

01:30:57.087 --> 01:30:59.160
All the Indians slaughtered.

01:31:01.224 --> 01:31:04.352
We come across
the same type of thing a while back.

01:31:05.449 --> 01:31:08.577
I tell you, this is a crazy country.

01:31:12.715 --> 01:31:13.782
$100...

01:31:15.847 --> 01:31:16.952
...buys that scalp back.

01:31:21.044 --> 01:31:23.196
Nice doing business with you,
Mr. Gatewood.

01:31:24.164 --> 01:31:25.205
But...

01:31:27.321 --> 01:31:29.377
...I changed my mind.

01:31:29.444 --> 01:31:31.530
You rotten son of a bitch.

01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:33.547
Amigo.

01:31:42.978 --> 01:31:45.068
Move it, Dixie boy.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.267
Goddamn.

01:32:42.388 --> 01:32:45.541
I never thought I'd get killed
trying to help save an Apache.

01:32:46.621 --> 01:32:48.644
We got them, Mr. Sieber.

01:32:49.733 --> 01:32:51.756
We got them all.

01:32:54.892 --> 01:32:58.045
I've been gun-shot, arrow-shot 17 times.

01:33:00.147 --> 01:33:03.292
Twenty years chasing old Geronimo.

01:33:06.349 --> 01:33:08.493
I'd love nothing better
than being there to...

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.582
...finish.

01:33:12.643 --> 01:33:15.742
You don't have to
account yourself to me, Al.

01:33:16.768 --> 01:33:17.865
You're a brave man.

01:33:20.968 --> 01:33:23.103
I never did have no kind of luck.

01:33:24.134 --> 01:33:26.148
Never did.

01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:36.588
I'm going to catch me
a little sleep here for...

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.775
...a minute or two.

01:33:42.882 --> 01:33:44.946
Rotten sons of bitches.

01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.170
Gatewood!

01:34:14.121 --> 01:34:15.188
No more burro!

01:34:15.210 --> 01:34:16.286
Can't go higher!

01:34:30.838 --> 01:34:31.922
Chato and l...

01:34:32.919 --> 01:34:34.975
...are going on here alone.

01:34:36.102 --> 01:34:38.170
You stay with the supplies.

01:34:40.197 --> 01:34:40.284
Sir.

01:34:43.313 --> 01:34:44.443
Are you giving me a choice?

01:34:45.428 --> 01:34:47.520
That's an order, Lieutenant.

01:34:49.578 --> 01:34:53.782
I know it's hard to come this far then stop,
and I'm sorry.

01:34:56.893 --> 01:34:59.992
But somebody's got to go back
and tell the truth.

01:35:04.171 --> 01:35:04.263
Britton...

01:35:06.332 --> 01:35:08.396
...you're a fine officer.

01:35:09.406 --> 01:35:10.486
Stay noble.

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.682
We're trying to make a country here.

01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:17.802
It's hard.

01:36:17.249 --> 01:36:19.317
Why did you bring him?

01:36:25.507 --> 01:36:27.621
He is an enemy to his people!

01:36:32.818 --> 01:36:33.915
He thinks you are.

01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:39.099
He is a brave man to come here.
Enough Chiricahua are dead.

01:36:46.419 --> 01:36:50.582
They are dead
because the White-Eye killed them.

01:37:05.197 --> 01:37:08.253
Have they taught you to lie, Gatewood?

01:37:10.335 --> 01:37:11.419
I don't lie.

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:17.634
But the truth is, General Miles
will hunt you for 50 years.

01:37:18.693 --> 01:37:22.898
He's already sent your families to Florida,
which is far, far away.

01:37:24.954 --> 01:37:26.012
Look around.

01:37:27.027 --> 01:37:29.128
See how few warriors you have left.

01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:33.300
If I kill White-Eyes forever...

01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:37.537
...I am still Geronimo, an Apache.

01:37:39.593 --> 01:37:41.625
Who are you, Gatewood?

01:37:41.704 --> 01:37:44.777
Just a man like you.

01:37:45.837 --> 01:37:47.902
And I want to go home.

01:37:47.952 --> 01:37:50.025
I want to see my family.

01:37:56.243 --> 01:37:57.315
My God....

01:37:59.413 --> 01:38:01.482
My God is a God of peace.

01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:04.631
A God of life, not death.

01:38:06.696 --> 01:38:08.752
What does your God say?

01:38:09.765 --> 01:38:11.934
Yosin is not here with us on the mountain.

01:38:16.034 --> 01:38:18.160
Tell me, what is in your heart?

01:38:19.196 --> 01:38:21.239
The war is over.

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.515
I offer this...

01:38:27.516 --> 01:38:29.606
...because it has power for me.

01:38:31.741 --> 01:38:33.810
Our fight must end here.

01:38:35.912 --> 01:38:39.040
When I was young, I took a wife.

01:38:41.055 --> 01:38:43.144
We lived in these mountains.

01:38:44.179 --> 01:38:45.297
We have our family.

01:38:47.328 --> 01:38:49.484
The Mexican soldiers came
and they killed her.

01:38:50.523 --> 01:38:53.617
They killed her and my two little girls.

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.792
They killed them because we are Apache.

01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:04.064
I remember when I found their bodies.

01:39:06.088 --> 01:39:11.305
I stood until much time had passed,
not knowing what to do.

01:39:13.454 --> 01:39:15.489
I had no weapon...

01:39:16.565 --> 01:39:18.675
...but I did not want to fight.

01:39:19.702 --> 01:39:21.729
I did not pray.

01:39:22.826 --> 01:39:24.890
I did not do anything.

01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:28.048
I had no purpose left.

01:39:31.172 --> 01:39:33.261
After a year had passed...

01:39:35.267 --> 01:39:38.412
...my power showed me
how to get revenge.

01:39:39.509 --> 01:39:43.641
And always, since then, I get revenge.

01:39:45.715 --> 01:39:47.816
But no matter how many I kill...

01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:52.022
...I could not bring back my family.

01:39:55.166 --> 01:39:56.208
Yosin...

01:39:57.239 --> 01:40:00.347
...the Apache God, is a God of peace.

01:40:04.559 --> 01:40:07.658
I gave you the blue stone.

01:40:11.816 --> 01:40:13.881
You give me this.

01:40:23.253 --> 01:40:25.322
It will be peace.

01:40:29.559 --> 01:40:32.650
On September 4, 1886...

01:40:33.659 --> 01:40:36.853
...Geronimo and 34 Chiricahua men,
women and children...

01:40:36.887 --> 01:40:39.952
...surrendered to General Nelson Miles.

01:40:40.003 --> 01:40:44.107
As he handed over his weapons,
Geronimo simply said:

01:40:44.157 --> 01:40:49.312
'Once I moved about like the wind.
Now I surrender and that is all. '

01:40:50.363 --> 01:40:53.504
He refused any further conversation
with the General.

01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:36.293
After arranging Geronimo's
final surrender...

01:41:36.301 --> 01:41:41.498
...Lieutenant Gatewood was transferred
to a remote garrison in Northern Wyoming.

01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:45.702
His continued presence would have been
an embarrassing reminder...

01:41:46.653 --> 01:41:50.857
...that the United States Army had failed
to defeat a band of 35 Apache.

01:41:51.962 --> 01:41:56.050
Instead of being rewarded with a medal
for his heroic efforts...

01:41:56.129 --> 01:42:00.212
...Lieutenant Charles Gatewood
was sentenced to obscurity.

01:42:15.928 --> 01:42:19.006
Sir, formation is ready.

01:42:25.254 --> 01:42:26.309
Attention!

01:42:26.322 --> 01:42:29.458
-Prepare to mount!
-Present arms!

01:42:30.455 --> 01:42:31.497
Mount!

01:42:33.654 --> 01:42:36.719
Detail, arms, halt!

01:42:36.741 --> 01:42:40.870
'By order of the office
of the President of the United States...

01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:44.035
'...all Chiricahua scouts are under arrest...

01:42:44.052 --> 01:42:47.176
'...and will be transported
to Fort Marion Prison...

01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:49.236
'...Saint Augustine, Florida...

01:42:49.245 --> 01:42:53.478
'...with the outlaw Apaches,
led by Goyakla, known as Geronimo!

01:42:54.462 --> 01:42:56.577
'The Apache scouts
from the White Mountain...

01:42:56.585 --> 01:43:00.731
'...Coyotero and Mescalero tribes
are to return at once...

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.767
'...to their reservations.

01:43:02.775 --> 01:43:07.980
'They will remain within these boundaries
unless given express permission to travel.

01:43:08.059 --> 01:43:11.208
'Their duties for the United States Army
are at an end.

01:43:12.168 --> 01:43:14.291
'We thank them for their services.'

01:43:15.308 --> 01:43:16.333
Detail!

01:43:16.376 --> 01:43:17.465
Collect arms!

01:43:33.076 --> 01:43:35.182
I'm a good Apache, it's not right.

01:43:37.205 --> 01:43:39.362
I'm Sergeant Chato, a scout.

01:43:55.953 --> 01:43:59.152
Later that afternoon,
Geronimo, his band of renegades...

01:44:00.124 --> 01:44:03.269
...and all the Chiricahua
that had served the Army so faithfully...

01:44:03.281 --> 01:44:07.422
...were loaded into wagons and transported
to the railhead at Holbrook.

01:44:07.515 --> 01:44:11.681
There, they were to begin their journey
to Florida and imprisonment.

01:44:16.866 --> 01:44:17.888
Halt!

01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:37.691
Morning report, sir.

01:44:39.826 --> 01:44:42.882
Mr. Glenville, I'd like to see the General.

01:44:42.925 --> 01:44:44.005
On what business?

01:44:44.981 --> 01:44:46.066
It's about Mr. Gatewood.

01:45:10.006 --> 01:45:10.077
Sir.

01:45:13.134 --> 01:45:15.257
I thought the US Army kept its word.

01:45:17.309 --> 01:45:20.433
I thought maybe
we were the only ones left who did.

01:45:21.539 --> 01:45:24.592
What's going on out there is a disgrace.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.647
Lieutenant.

01:45:25.705 --> 01:45:28.825
You're more worried
about keeping your word to a savage...

01:45:28.834 --> 01:45:32.941
...than you are fulfilling your duties
to the citizens of this country.

01:45:32.979 --> 01:45:35.102
We won. That's what matters.

01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:40.303
It's over, Lieutenant.

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:46.497
Geronimo, the Apache, the whole history
of the West, except being a farmer.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.741
Mr. Gatewood wouldn't want me
to be a part of any of this.

01:45:56.899 --> 01:45:58.017
I hate an idealist.

01:45:59.068 --> 01:46:02.175
There's always something messy
about them.

01:46:08.369 --> 01:46:09.416
I'm ashamed.

01:46:15.726 --> 01:46:17.832
And you have my resignation.

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:25.086
To the disappointment
of family and friends...

01:46:25.123 --> 01:46:27.216
...I had ended my military career.

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.388
Over the years, the events
surrounding the Geronimo Campaign...

01:46:32.426 --> 01:46:34.445
...have continued to haunt me.

01:46:35.563 --> 01:46:37.648
I carry the memory of those days...

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.701
...days of bravery and cruelty...

01:46:40.739 --> 01:46:42.807
...of heroism and deceit.

01:46:43.867 --> 01:46:46.007
And I am still faced with
an undeniable truth:

01:46:48.042 --> 01:46:51.208
A way of life that endured
a thousand years was gone.

01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:54.327
This desert...

01:46:55.299 --> 01:46:57.400
...this land that we look out on...

01:46:58.465 --> 01:47:00.525
...would never be the same.

01:47:13.096 --> 01:47:16.237
You were right to fight the White-Eye.

01:47:22.439 --> 01:47:25.542
Everything they said to me was a lie.

01:47:34.989 --> 01:47:37.082
You helped them...

01:47:40.194 --> 01:47:43.305
I will hate you forever.

01:47:52.644 --> 01:47:54.775
There are so few of us left...

01:47:56.827 --> 01:47:58.959
We should not hate each other.

01:48:05.207 --> 01:48:08.297
She has the coughing sickness.

01:48:11.488 --> 01:48:13.581
She will die soon.

01:48:14.583 --> 01:48:16.681
Maybe the baby, too.

01:48:29.181 --> 01:48:33.347
No one knows why the One God
let the White-Eye take our land.

01:48:41.672 --> 01:48:44.841
Why did there have to be
so many of them?

01:48:47.949 --> 01:48:52.082
Why did they have so many guns,
so many horses?

01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:00.483
For many years,
the One God made me a warrior.

01:49:09.859 --> 01:49:13.988
No gun, no bullets, could ever kill me.

01:49:19.218 --> 01:49:21.303
That was my power...

01:49:24.427 --> 01:49:27.526
Now my time is over.

01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:32.835
Now, maybe, the time
of our people is over.

01:50:09.326 --> 01:50:12.396
Geronimo lived for another 22 years...

01:50:12.434 --> 01:50:14.494
...as a prisoner of war.

01:50:15.545 --> 01:50:16.634
Despite its promise...

01:50:17.601 --> 01:50:19.758
...the federal government
never let him return home.
