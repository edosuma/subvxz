WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.046
Previously onDynasty...Monthly chelation therapy

00:03.090 --> 00:06.223
will mitigate the side effects
of the neurotoxicity.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.659
But it's not a cure.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.400
I want you out of the manor
before the end of the day.

00:09.444 --> 00:12.186
I was so broken
after the baby died.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.927
Blake couldn't control
his rage. He lost it.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.886
I didn't know for sure
that Blake killed Mack

00:16.929 --> 00:18.366
until you just told me.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.629
We both helped someone
get away with murder.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.110
FALLON: I know everything.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.025
You are a liar!

00:26.113 --> 00:27.549
And a murderer!

00:27.592 --> 00:29.768
And youare misinformed.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.770
As much as I'm enjoying
this tantrum,

00:31.814 --> 00:33.076
you don't know
the whole story, Fallon.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.947
What more is
there to know?

00:34.991 --> 00:37.602
You lied and manipulated
me into helping

00:37.646 --> 00:40.083
exonerate you for a
crime you did commit.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.606
I outed Becky, the
spray tan artist,

00:41.650 --> 00:43.695
for using HGH,
and she will probably

00:43.739 --> 00:45.001
see more jail
time than you.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.178
And you actually
murdered...Fallon, enough!

00:48.222 --> 00:49.440
You need to keep
your voice down.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.094
Why? I'm pretty sure
I'm the only one

00:51.138 --> 00:52.617
that was dumb enough
to actually believe you.

00:54.793 --> 00:55.968
Apologies for the interruption.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.101
I have a situation developing,
and I wondered

00:58.145 --> 01:01.496
if I could borrow Fallon
for a moment.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.237
Please. Take as much time

01:03.280 --> 01:05.108
as you need.
Maybe you should try being happy

01:05.152 --> 01:06.892
your father's not in prison.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.723
I need your help.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.204
KIRBY:
Hi. It's me.

01:14.248 --> 01:17.251
I wanted to let you know
I'm committing to Joel

01:17.294 --> 01:20.123
and Synergy.
This is what's best for me,

01:20.167 --> 01:23.126
so please respect my decision
and don't contact me.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.259
Goodbye, Dad.Joel?

01:25.302 --> 01:27.609
Is that the weird guy
she met at the hotel?

01:27.652 --> 01:29.828
Yes, he's some sort
of a self-help guru.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.830
Right now I guess he's

01:31.874 --> 01:33.049
self-helping himself
to whatever money

01:33.093 --> 01:34.094
Kirby brought with her.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.705
You didn't hear from her,
did you?

01:36.748 --> 01:38.750
No, I was too busy
setting a murderer free.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.144
Speaking of, why don't
you ask himfor help?

01:41.188 --> 01:42.232
Well, I can hardly
ask your father.

01:42.276 --> 01:43.538
He's the one
that kicked Kirby out

01:43.581 --> 01:45.540
in the first place.Of course he did.

01:45.583 --> 01:49.021
Well, Blake will not ruin
another innocent life.

01:49.065 --> 01:52.199
I will undo some of the
bad karma he has foisted

01:52.242 --> 01:55.376
upon this family before it comes
back around like a tsunami.

01:56.290 --> 02:00.642
What I'm trying to say
is, let's go save Kirby.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.296
BLAKE:
To moving onward
and upward.

02:04.385 --> 02:07.475
I wanted to apologize again.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.781
I'm sorry I let it slip
to Fallon.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.435
I was just so exhausted
after the trial,

02:11.479 --> 02:12.915
and not thinking clearly.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.700
That was not your fault.
Fallon took advantage of that.

02:15.744 --> 02:18.355
And she thinks that I'mthe one
that's manipulative, huh?

02:18.399 --> 02:21.750
Well, nevertheless, I am not
gonna let her attitude

02:21.793 --> 02:24.883
affect our
bright future.Look at you, Mr. Sunshine.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.495
Actually... it's
Captain Sunshine.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.192
To show the rest
of the world

02:29.236 --> 02:30.759
I'm back at the
metaphorical helm,

02:30.802 --> 02:33.414
I've decided to throw myself
a yacht-themed freedom fiesta.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.504
Oh, that explains the prawns
and the lobster and...

02:36.547 --> 02:39.855
that.
That, my dear,

02:39.898 --> 02:41.204
is baby eel.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.902
It's considered
endangered globally.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.034
Not in myhouse.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.688
This party is
mostly strategic.

02:46.731 --> 02:49.343
I've invited the Greater Georgia
Yacht Club members

02:49.386 --> 02:53.782
to eat and drink and hopefully
reinstate my membership.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.740
I am sick of reading
about deals being made

02:55.784 --> 02:57.220
without me in
back rooms.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.354
But I can't sail anywhere
without my cocaptain.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.833
I'm with you.

03:03.444 --> 03:06.229
I just need to find my own way
to say goodbye to the past.

03:06.273 --> 03:09.189
Well, I will support
whatever you need.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.758
SAM:
What percentage
of our time together

03:13.802 --> 03:15.282
do you think we're both dressed?

03:15.325 --> 03:18.415
Uh, I'd say just
the right percentage.Mmm.

03:20.809 --> 03:21.940
Are you complaining?

03:21.984 --> 03:25.422
No.
Maybe a little.

03:25.466 --> 03:28.208
Well, I wouldn't be running out
if you hadn't fired me.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.818
I have three interviews
today alone.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.472
Guy's got to
eat, right?

03:31.515 --> 03:34.431
Mm-hmm. I just wish
I knew more about you,

03:34.475 --> 03:36.041
in general.
Like,

03:36.085 --> 03:38.130
what's your middle name?
Do you even have a middle name?

03:38.174 --> 03:40.437
We never have time
to just talk.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.657
Well, lucky for you
I'm free tomorrow night.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.789
If you have a spot
in your schedule

03:44.833 --> 03:47.270
for a fully dressed date.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.751
Fully dressed?

03:49.794 --> 03:53.233
Let's not get carried away.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.628
MICHAEL:
I know we're a week away
from the home opener,

03:57.672 --> 03:59.195
but we definitely
should be able

03:59.239 --> 04:01.632
to land one of the global brands
that you reeled in to bite

04:01.676 --> 04:02.677
on the stadium naming rights.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.505
A partnership
with a young club

04:04.548 --> 04:06.768
is where sponsorships
are trending.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.813
I got to say, man,
you are gonna crush this.

04:08.857 --> 04:12.469
I think you mean weare going
to crush this.

04:12.513 --> 04:15.472
Nope. I mean what I say
and I say what I mean.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.647
You don't need me.

04:16.691 --> 04:19.041
And as proof of
my confidence in you,

04:19.084 --> 04:21.173
I'm giving you
my Atlantix shares.

04:21.217 --> 04:24.394
Whoa, whoa.
I mean, these shares,

04:24.438 --> 04:26.309
plus Fallon's,
means that...Mm-hmm.

04:26.353 --> 04:29.094
You are now by far
the majority owner.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.183
Well, you don't need to do this.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.794
I want you
as my partner.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.012
I n-- I need you.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.928
There's no Megan Rapinoe
without Alex Morgan.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.670
Look, man...

04:39.714 --> 04:41.846
I only got involved here
as a move against Blake,

04:41.890 --> 04:43.326
not for the love
of the game.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.025
And I need to prioritize
some other things

04:47.069 --> 04:48.113
in my life right now.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.899
Okay, I get it.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.467
You need to take care
of number one.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.469
And now I've got
your shiny shoes to fill.

04:55.512 --> 04:58.863
I'm not worried, man.
You got this.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.569
FALLON:
Liam just confirmed

05:08.612 --> 05:11.354
that the Femperial authors
received notice

05:11.398 --> 05:13.574
that Kirby
has sold the company.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.533
I wonder whose idea
it was to sell.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.188
I knew Joel was
Jared-Leto-plus-one-wrong-turn.

05:19.231 --> 05:20.842
One minute you're getting drunk
at a concert.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.887
Next thing you know, you're
emptying your bank account

05:22.931 --> 05:24.585
in the name of Synergy.Not helpful.

05:24.628 --> 05:25.890
I should have stepped in sooner.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.675
Hey, we all could have
paid more attention.

05:27.718 --> 05:31.418
The only guilty party is
my selfish snake of a father.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.723
SAM:
Do we even know if Kirby

05:32.767 --> 05:35.204
wantsto be saved?Again, not helpful.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.598
Okay, can somebody please
say something that ishelpful?

05:37.641 --> 05:40.296
I tracked down
the Synergy compound.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.081
It's located three hours east
in South Carolina,

05:43.125 --> 05:44.909
but it's not a place
we can just walk into.

05:44.953 --> 05:48.130
The website says they're focused
on families

05:48.173 --> 05:52.003
but only allow the uninitiated
inside during open house days;

05:52.047 --> 05:53.744
the next one of those
is not for two weeks.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.965
Oh, God, these are problems.
We need solutions, you know?

05:57.008 --> 05:59.097
More can-do, less can-don't.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.578
What about this? "Synergy
seeking doctor to heal others

06:01.622 --> 06:03.885
and heal thyself. ASAP."

06:03.928 --> 06:05.060
Simple. One of us
poses as a doctor

06:05.103 --> 06:06.627
and sets up an interview.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.977
That would be enough time
to get inside and find Kirby.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.066
"Medical credentials
required."

06:11.109 --> 06:13.764
I mean, even my best contact
would have a hard time

06:13.808 --> 06:15.592
faking one of those
on short notice.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.420
And I doubt any sane doctors

06:17.464 --> 06:18.813
would want to get
mixed up in this.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.597
Probably not.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.121
But I know an insaneone

06:23.165 --> 06:25.602
that might be
desperate enough to help.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.778
Daddy?

06:27.822 --> 06:29.650
Nope. Sister.

06:29.693 --> 06:32.304
And desperate times
call for desperate brothers.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.437
Well, if you're here
for some verbal sparring,

06:34.481 --> 06:35.917
you'll have to wait.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.745
Until when?

06:37.788 --> 06:38.963
Your next break
from doing nothing?

06:39.007 --> 06:40.312
What do you need, Fallon?

06:40.356 --> 06:41.401
Just one simple favor.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.794
I need you to go
to a job interview

06:43.838 --> 06:44.839
for a doctor position

06:44.882 --> 06:45.970
with a self-help group

06:46.014 --> 06:47.189
so we can save Kirby

06:47.232 --> 06:48.843
before she goes all
Wild Wild Country.

06:48.886 --> 06:52.324
Well, I barely know Kirby,
so why would I save her?

06:52.368 --> 06:53.325
Or help you?

06:53.369 --> 06:54.457
How many reasons do you need?

06:54.501 --> 06:55.980
You tried to kill Liam,

06:56.024 --> 06:57.765
and I didn't press charges.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.854
You're alone in the middle
of the day playing sudoku.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.421
And you owe it

07:01.464 --> 07:02.813
to the universe
to bank some karma

07:02.857 --> 07:04.032
for the Carrington kids.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.992
And I'll talk to Blake

07:08.036 --> 07:09.167
about letting you back
into the manor.

07:09.211 --> 07:12.475
You'll... talk to Daddy for me?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.259
Only if you stop
calling him that.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.826
Okay, yeah, I think

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
this could be a good chance
for the two of us to bond.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.699
No. Not gonna happen.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.223
Fine, fine, just promise me

07:21.266 --> 07:23.225
you will keep your creepiness
in check

07:23.268 --> 07:25.009
until after we save Kirby.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.446
Okay? And then
you and I

07:26.489 --> 07:28.012
can braid each other's hair

07:28.056 --> 07:29.057
and tell ghost stories
all night.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.548
JENNINGS: No!

08:08.313 --> 08:09.967
It would mean a lot to me
if you were here.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.230
Yeah. Well, I, um,

08:12.274 --> 08:16.844
I appreciate that.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.280
Yeah, I'll see you then.

08:18.323 --> 08:21.413
Rex Brown.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.676
Yacht club president.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.026
Though he insists
on being called "commodore."

08:25.069 --> 08:28.595
Last board member to RSVP and
make himself seem important,

08:28.638 --> 08:30.031
that pompous ass.
I invented that move.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.902
So is he gonna
reinstate you?
I don't know.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.382
He implied that
his palms are dry,

08:33.425 --> 08:34.557
so I'll probably have
to figure out

08:34.601 --> 08:35.602
some way to grease 'em.

08:38.039 --> 08:38.909
Did you go riding?

08:38.953 --> 08:41.825
I did.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.393
I thought confronting
Mark's death and my accident

08:44.436 --> 08:46.090
would help me find closure.

08:47.570 --> 08:50.442
And then I found this.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.792
Do you know where
it came from?

08:51.835 --> 08:53.228
Well, I shoot all kinds
of ammo out at the range.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.229
I probably dropped it.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.970
But it wasn't at the range.

08:56.013 --> 08:59.016
I found it right near
the area where Mark was killed.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.457
Don't overthink it.

09:05.501 --> 09:06.981
It's just a coincidence.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.332
It's time
to let this all go.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.768
Isn't that why
you went out there?

09:11.812 --> 09:14.815
Yeah. You're right.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.079
Time to let it go.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.297
MICHAEL:
Thanks for coming.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.995
I've got five representatives
from different

09:21.038 --> 09:23.475
billion-dollar companies who are
interested in the naming rights.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.869
I don't care who pays up,
but we need the money

09:25.913 --> 09:27.305
to keep ownership
of our stadium,

09:27.349 --> 09:29.133
buy new players,
stay competitive.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.787
Look, I don't know
anything about soccer,

09:30.831 --> 09:34.443
but I do know what people
want, and it's not... this.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.880
If you overload the reps
with numbers and percentages,

09:36.924 --> 09:38.490
they're gonna fall asleep.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.449
I'm trying to show them it's a
good investment, not just a name

09:40.492 --> 09:41.624
on a stadium.
Don't bother.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.495
These guys came here
for a good time

09:43.539 --> 09:44.627
and the VIP treatment.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.108
So, what are your plans?

09:47.151 --> 09:49.240
Well, we're gonna watch
tomorrow's away game

09:49.284 --> 09:51.808
in a screening room
in the office after my pitch.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.636
Wow. An office
party with a TV.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.160
You are really going all out.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.640
Maybe you should

09:57.684 --> 10:00.295
steal the team jet
and just fly them to the game.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.297
That's actually
not a bad idea.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.994
MICHAEL:
I could do that.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.518
But schmoozing's
not really my thing.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.390
I'd feel better

10:08.433 --> 10:11.349
if you signed on
as the team's full-time PR guy.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.134
SAM:
Uh, no.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.571
Not gonna happen. Fletcher has
plans tomorrow night.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.138
But he can start after that.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.142
Well, then I'm coming, too.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.360
I can use

10:22.404 --> 10:24.841
my hotelier charm
to pose as an investor

10:24.885 --> 10:26.364
and recon.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.236
Fuel up the jet.
It's date night.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.541
JENNINGS:
Hey, Tony,

10:29.585 --> 10:31.326
can I ask you a question?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.502
I use club soda
instead of water.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.373
The bubbles help with growth.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.985
Uh, it's a non-plant-
related question.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.160
Oh.

10:39.203 --> 10:40.683
I found this out
in the field.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.859
I was wondering
if maybe the staff

10:42.903 --> 10:44.861
was testing some
of Blake's guns?

10:44.905 --> 10:47.516
This is a custom
Carrington round.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.691
Uh, which means
only the family

10:48.735 --> 10:50.214
would have had access.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.564
Ammo is always kept
in the locked gun room.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.349
I found it near
where the accident

10:54.392 --> 10:55.655
with Mark Jennings happened,

10:55.698 --> 10:57.874
so I was just
wondering.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.876
Um...

10:59.920 --> 11:03.401
well, I think Mack had access

11:03.445 --> 11:04.968
to Mr. Carrington's
guns and ammo.

11:05.012 --> 11:08.145
And if he killed
your friend, then

11:08.189 --> 11:10.408
he's probably the one
that dropped this.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.715
That does make sense.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.674
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

11:16.458 --> 11:17.807
I think you made a mistake.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.070
Cristal found a bullet
where Mark was shot,

11:20.114 --> 11:22.072
and now she's
asking questions.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.639
What kind of questions?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.554
How do I think it got there?

11:25.597 --> 11:27.599
Who would be using
that kind of bullet?

11:27.643 --> 11:29.079
Why are my hedges
so beautiful?

11:29.123 --> 11:31.647
I'm assuming my name
did not come out of your mouth.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.259
You mean, did I tell her you
asked me to lie to the police

11:35.303 --> 11:37.914
so you'd have an alibi during
the time of Mark's murder?

11:37.958 --> 11:40.003
No, I left that out.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.744
That's not exactly the way
it happened, Anthony.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.224
I think your mind

11:43.267 --> 11:44.355
might be a little hazy.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.748
All I'm saying is,

11:45.792 --> 11:47.576
she might go looking
for the gun.

11:47.619 --> 11:52.059
And I've seen enough Unsolved Mysteries
to know that even

11:52.102 --> 11:55.236
the most experienced criminals
leave behind fingerprints,

11:55.279 --> 11:57.020
casings, uh, DNA.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.761
I see.

11:58.805 --> 12:02.765
Well, if I had been involved,
which I was not,

12:02.809 --> 12:04.332
I would be very
appreciative

12:04.375 --> 12:07.727
of you tipping me off so I can
do what I now need to do.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.519
FALLON:
Your code name

12:17.562 --> 12:19.086
is Dr. Mike Harrison.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.478
Oh, that's not a code name.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.828
That was my actual name
for many years

12:21.871 --> 12:23.612
until I found out
I was related to you.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.527
Oh, cool story.
Put it in a book.

12:25.570 --> 12:29.270
From here on out,
I am Nurse Sheila Heart.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.794
What? It's Bond girl-adjacent
but with more depth.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.101
Besides, the code names won't
matter if you screw this up.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.625
I'm sorry,
I-I can't hear you

12:36.668 --> 12:38.409
over the deafening
lack of gratitude.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.890
Oh, no, no, no. What you're
hearing is a lack of faith.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.631
Ah.Or not hearing. I don't know.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.459
Now, are we clear on the plan?

12:44.502 --> 12:46.461
Yeah, I'm gonna eat up time
in the interview,

12:46.504 --> 12:48.245
you find Kirby,
convince her to leave.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.117
And then I say no to the job

12:50.160 --> 12:51.292
and then we head home.Great.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.777
Dr. Harrison,
I presume.That's right.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.301
And this is my nurse Sheila.Sheila.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.868
I thought you were told
we don't have the resources

13:01.911 --> 13:03.086
to hire a nurse.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.741
Oh, um, I'm sorry,
I must have missed that.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.874
Uh...Uh, Sheila Heart.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.703
I was so looking forward to
working with your community.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.836
I'm very synergistic.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.665
I'm sorry, but you'll have
to wait out here.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.667
Privacy is very important
to Joel.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.321
No unauthorized
visitors.

13:20.364 --> 13:24.064
Oh, but I am so much more
than just a visitor,

13:24.107 --> 13:25.935
you know-- and
Dr. Harrison's nurse,

13:25.979 --> 13:29.460
because I am also his wife.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.635
Yes.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.637
And I know
that Synergy

13:32.681 --> 13:35.858
has an open arms policy
for family-focused couples,

13:35.902 --> 13:37.860
you know, looking
to grow their tribe.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.340
So you're basically you're
getting a two-for-one.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.386
Or maybe even a three-for-one.No.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.779
Sorry. Morning sickness.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.613
Okay, come on in.

13:51.656 --> 13:52.962
Oh, perfect.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.531
FALLON:
I made the mistake

13:56.574 --> 13:59.534
of drinking a Big Gulp-sized
kombucha on the drive over here

13:59.577 --> 14:02.493
and I really need
to use the restroom.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.669
Right this way,
around the corner.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.020
I'll take the doctor in
for his meeting.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.203
Alexis.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.640
What are you doing here?

14:18.683 --> 14:21.730
I am just a mother
looking for her son.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.210
Adam doesn't live here.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.386
And even if he did,
you can't just waltz in here

14:25.429 --> 14:26.735
whenever you feel like it.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.041
I'll be sure
to mention that

14:28.084 --> 14:29.390
to security as I escort you out.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.132
I am so sorry
for the intrusion.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.612
I owe you and Blake

14:34.656 --> 14:36.005
a much bigger apology than this,

14:36.049 --> 14:37.702
but since I am here,

14:37.746 --> 14:40.836
I am sorry for everything.

14:42.185 --> 14:44.405
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.059
I am being 100% genuine.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.669
You're 100% full of crap.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.760
I've suffered, too.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.110
I know what trauma
can do to a person.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.548
How have you been doing
since you lost the baby?

14:59.289 --> 15:01.030
It must have been
very difficult.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.771
It was.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.906
And still is.

15:08.298 --> 15:11.867
I realize that we're nowhere
near a clean slate,

15:11.911 --> 15:14.174
but ending our feud
would give you

15:14.217 --> 15:16.002
more space for some closure.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.701
Just know that
I feel your pain,

15:19.744 --> 15:21.703
and it will get better.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.804
FALLON:
Wow. Woodwork.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.675
They really must
brainwash you here.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.635
Surprised to see me?

15:40.678 --> 15:42.506
Am I surprised to see you? Yeah.

15:42.550 --> 15:43.855
Surprised the first thing

15:43.899 --> 15:45.814
that came out of your mouth
was an insult? No.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.643
Okay, well, we can talk
about my character flaws later.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.950
I am here because your father
is worried.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.474
You disappeared
and sold Femperial.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.563
And now we're all worried
this guy Joel is using you.

15:56.912 --> 16:00.089
I hear your concern,
but Synergy isn't using me.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.264
I am using them

16:01.308 --> 16:04.137
to heal from
toxic relationships.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.877
I know you don't care about me.

16:05.921 --> 16:06.966
What are you talking
about, Kirby?

16:07.009 --> 16:08.619
I'm here because I do care.

16:08.663 --> 16:12.623
Well, if that's true, then trust
what I'm doing is best for me,

16:12.667 --> 16:13.885
and leave.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.627
Or else I'll tell everyone
you snuck in here.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.847
No, you won't.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.327
Because then

16:20.370 --> 16:22.546
I'll tell Joel that you've been
making calls from here,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.896
which obviously
is not allowed.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.682
JOEL:
Were you able to
find the restroom?

16:30.163 --> 16:31.338
Um...

16:32.904 --> 16:34.819
Yeah, I showed it to her.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.997
Good. You know, we've
been looking for you.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.303
Me?

16:41.348 --> 16:44.481
To officially welcome you
and Mike into

16:44.525 --> 16:45.700
the Synergy family.

16:45.743 --> 16:48.746
Your husband is the
new doctor here.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.661
Trust our journey, Sheila.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.402
Come.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.621
Oh.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.719
Welcome aboard, everyone.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.069
And I promise you,
for Blake Carrington,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.071
it is smooth sailing
from here on out.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.421
Cheers.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.424
You are coming along, too.
Yes, you are.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.339
I hope you know how to swim.

17:16.383 --> 17:17.949
Ahoy, Robin.
ROBIN:
Blake.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.125
Let's get you a drink.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.561
Thanks for getting
back to me, Officer.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.911
Now, just to clarify,

17:22.954 --> 17:25.914
that wasa .38-caliber round
that killed Mr. Jennings?

17:25.957 --> 17:28.960
Okay. Thank you for your help.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.962
There you are.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.529
People are asking
about you.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.402
I'm sorry. I was just
talking to my brother.

17:35.445 --> 17:39.406
Hey, before we go in, thank you
for being my North Star.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.103
You've given me a
sense of direction

17:41.147 --> 17:42.452
I've never felt before.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.324
At a time when I needed it most.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.327
Onward and upward.
Together, right?

17:47.370 --> 17:49.938
Aye, aye.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.421
FALLON:
We tracked down Kirby.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.684
She's totally safe,
at least physically.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.294
Mentally,
it's too soon to tell.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.513
ANDERS :
I discovered
that Femperial's funds

17:59.556 --> 18:01.254
are being transferred tomorrow

18:01.297 --> 18:03.647
into her account,
which now includes Joel's name.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.258
Interesting.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.825
I found out that Joel and a
bunch of high-ranking members

18:07.869 --> 18:10.480
are traveling to Synergy's new
Sri Lankan island tomorrow.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.787
Is Kirby planning
to go with them?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.789
No way. No, this is reserved
for the program's

18:14.832 --> 18:17.531
gold level members only,
and Kirby's definitely not gold.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.837
She might be blue?

18:19.881 --> 18:21.491
Okay, look, translation:
they're stealing Kirby's money,

18:21.535 --> 18:22.666
not Kirby.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.538
Uh-oh.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.061
FALLON:
Oh, God.ANDERS: What is it?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.497
Everything okay?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.196
Yes. It's just that
when Dr. Feelgood accepted

18:30.239 --> 18:32.198
the position that he was not
supposed to accept,

18:32.241 --> 18:34.330
we had to hand in
all of our stuff,

18:34.374 --> 18:36.158
so I hid the phone in my wig.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.029
But the charger
was not so lucky.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.901
Now that we're armed
with some real dirt

18:39.944 --> 18:42.164
on Joel, we should have
Kirby home before you know it.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.993
Well, just tell her
that I-I'm sorry

18:45.036 --> 18:46.342
for everything,

18:46.386 --> 18:48.083
and I just want her
back home, all right?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.041
And keep me informed.Copy, home base. Over and out.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.175
It's bad enough I have
to deal with Kirby.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.742
Now I have to tolerate you, too?

18:54.785 --> 18:57.092
All right, well,
if it's so bad

18:57.136 --> 18:58.572
that you have to save her,
why are you here?

18:58.615 --> 18:59.834
Because she's my friend.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.836
And since our dad
kicked her out,

19:01.879 --> 19:03.229
I feel morally
obligated to help.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.100
I'm sure Father had his reasons.His reasons?

19:05.144 --> 19:08.582
Did he also give you
his reasons for killing a man?

19:08.625 --> 19:09.931
He did.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.934
And it's complicated.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.591
Good afternoon.
Time to change

19:17.634 --> 19:19.636
and join everyone
for The Ceremony.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.117
Hmm.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.205
The Ceremony?

19:23.249 --> 19:25.033
Is that like a barbecue?

19:25.076 --> 19:27.905
I don't know. Let's hope
they're serving pork ribs

19:27.949 --> 19:30.038
and not handmaid's tail.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.257
SAM:
These naming rights,

19:31.300 --> 19:33.520
this seems like a good deal.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.000
Molly. How are you?

19:36.044 --> 19:39.265
So, I heard a rumor
that you went to UT.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.789
Well, I heard a rumor there were
gonna be shots on this ride.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.620
Well, anyway, I had some family
that went there, too,

19:46.663 --> 19:48.361
so Hook 'em Horns.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.103
Yes, great.
Excuse me for one second.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.457
I feel like an eighth grader
at homecoming.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.632
Uh, just remember
they're here to sample

19:58.675 --> 20:00.199
the Atlantix lifestyle.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.418
Let them nibble
before you clear their plate.

20:02.462 --> 20:06.205
Or bring in dessert.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.510
Who's ready to do some shots?

20:07.554 --> 20:09.077
OTHERS:
Yes!

20:09.120 --> 20:11.471
I want to express my gratitude
for your consideration

20:11.514 --> 20:12.907
with a gift.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.953
My team has already drawn up
plans and started permits

20:15.997 --> 20:19.392
for an expansive renovation
of the club's docks, all on me.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.176
Are these vessels to scale?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.831
This one seems
slightly out of place.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.007
That's my new mistress, Freedom.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.269
How big is she?

20:27.313 --> 20:29.271
300.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.187
Yours?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.321
295, but she's undergoing
some deck modifications now.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.410
Yeah, look,

20:37.453 --> 20:39.803
I don't want this to turn
into a deck-measuring contest.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.979
I just want my
membership back.

20:42.023 --> 20:42.893
So?

20:42.937 --> 20:44.286
Blake, you were tried for murder

20:44.330 --> 20:45.635
and didn't even
get an acquittal.

20:45.679 --> 20:46.854
I don't care how big

20:46.897 --> 20:49.509
your yacht is, the answer is no.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.121
SAM:
Well, you, uh,

20:53.164 --> 20:54.818
certainly got Culhane
to loosen up.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.385
He's enjoying himself.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.953
Well, Culhane's not the only one
that deserves a shout-out.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.303
Outstanding performance, Sam.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.305
Well, I was quite
the thespian as a kid.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.741
Is that so?
Were you into theater?Mm-hmm.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.222
No, no, no, no, no,
this is not about me.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.528
It's time for
you to spill.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.443
Mmm, mmm.

21:10.486 --> 21:14.055
Someone named Bob might have
mentioned some numbers to me,

21:14.098 --> 21:17.058
but I think I'm being lowballed,
so I should just say no,

21:17.101 --> 21:19.060
move on.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.584
Right? Better to reject
than to be rejected.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.934
Uh...
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's not be hasty.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.240
Let me see
what's going on.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.895
Save me some.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.158
Not making any promises.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.298
You startled me.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.256
My apologies. I just
have to retrieve a file

21:41.300 --> 21:44.259
for Blake.

21:44.303 --> 21:48.089
Shouldn't you be out there
sailing the party?

21:48.132 --> 21:51.353
I needed a breather
from yacht talk.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.485
Hmm.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.226
Any news from Kirby?

21:55.270 --> 21:57.098
Fallon's found her,

21:57.141 --> 21:59.361
thank God. Now she just
has to convince Kirby

21:59.405 --> 22:02.364
that Joel is a charlatan before
she does something stupid.

22:02.408 --> 22:05.280
Kirby loves you.
She'll come home.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.108
I'm not sure that's true.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.548
So, what are you
really doing in here?

22:14.724 --> 22:16.509
Actually, I could use your help.

22:16.552 --> 22:17.988
Does Blake have
a file on Mack?

22:18.032 --> 22:19.468
FALLON:
We just have to pull her aside

22:19.512 --> 22:20.948
and tell her about Joel

22:20.991 --> 22:22.645
and the funds,
away from everyone else.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.648
Uh, that might be easier
said than done. They all seem

22:25.692 --> 22:27.607
a little incestuous.
Oh, wow.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.173
Coming from you,
that's problematic.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.654
Oh, no.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.656
She's marrying him.
Um...

22:33.700 --> 22:34.657
Uh...

22:34.701 --> 22:36.006
excuse me.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.573
Is this a wedding?
No.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.271
This is the promotion ceremony
to gold level.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.708
Um...

22:41.751 --> 22:44.493
I think Joel is trying
to steal Kirby.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.285
JOEL: And finally,
we have a woman

22:54.329 --> 22:56.853
who has made
unprecedented progress

22:56.897 --> 22:59.378
despite the shackles
of her toxic past.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.118
I think he's talking
about you.
Zip it.

23:01.162 --> 23:04.208
We just need to find a way to
stall, so we can get her alone.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.558
I've watched you

23:05.601 --> 23:08.517
pull yourself from the landfill
that was your mind

23:08.561 --> 23:11.868
into the thriving garden
of your soul.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.522
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna...

23:13.566 --> 23:15.611
Hi, everyone.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.527
I know that I'm new here,
but I just

23:18.571 --> 23:22.183
had to share
from my soul... garden.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.620
What are you,
uh, doing, Nurse Sheila?

23:24.664 --> 23:25.969
No, no.
It's-it's fine.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.710
Everyone here has a voice,

23:27.754 --> 23:30.409
especially the new ones.Thank you, Joel.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.412
Your warm welcome
has been such a gift.

23:33.455 --> 23:36.153
So, as a thank you
and a tribute

23:36.197 --> 23:37.590
to the elite gold members

23:37.633 --> 23:39.896
and the, the
frequent flyers,

23:39.940 --> 23:43.944
my husband and I would like
to return the favor

23:43.987 --> 23:46.250
in the best way
we know how,

23:46.294 --> 23:48.818
so this is dedicated

all right, thank you,
thank you so much

24:39.565 --> 24:41.436
for that performance.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.785
Nice job.
You, too.

24:42.829 --> 24:43.960
JOEL:
Thank you.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.527
We are indeed happy together.No!

24:45.571 --> 24:47.790
It was meant to be ironic.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.619
Kirby, don't you see
that you are getting conned

24:50.663 --> 24:52.447
by this hippie huckster?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.797
I mean, he persuaded you
to sell Femperial so he

24:54.841 --> 24:56.146
could steal your money and fund

24:56.190 --> 24:58.409
his early retirement
on some island.

24:58.453 --> 25:00.281
You are way out of line,
Ms. Heart.ADAM: Hey!

25:00.324 --> 25:02.588
Don't you talk
to my wife that way.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.592
But I'm not his wife,
I'm his sister.

25:06.635 --> 25:07.810
Ew.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.246
And it's not
Ms. Heart,

25:09.290 --> 25:12.946
it's Ms. Carrington.

25:13.947 --> 25:17.080
Fallon Carrington.

25:19.300 --> 25:24.044
Okay. Not fans of
style or pop culture. Cool.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.785
Kirby, do you know
who these people are?

25:25.828 --> 25:27.961
Yes, I do, and I-I should have
told you sooner,

25:28.004 --> 25:30.311
but they're
leaving anyway.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.357
I'm not being conned, Fallon.
I chose to give them the money.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.578
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, okay.
That's not necessary.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.014
You say
we're friends,

25:38.058 --> 25:39.799
but maybe if you tried
to understand why I was here

25:39.842 --> 25:40.930
instead of just insulting me,

25:40.974 --> 25:42.541
you would see
that you're the con man.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.587
Woman. Person.
Whatever.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.458
You're the most toxic
Carrington of them all.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.678
Let's go.
Okay.

25:55.684 --> 25:58.034
Ah. From the accountant.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.297
Anything else?
Yeah, have you
seen Susan Rogers?

26:00.341 --> 26:02.125
Rex is forcing
my hand.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.606
I'm gonna rally the board
behind me first.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.260
ANDERS:
Last time I saw her,

26:06.303 --> 26:08.958
she was perusing the prawns just
a few minutes ago. Excuse me.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.351
Thank you.

26:10.394 --> 26:13.397
Oh, hey, hey.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.616
And what the hell
are you doing here?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.966
As a show of good faith
to Cristal.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.795
She invited me.
Did she not mention that?

26:19.839 --> 26:21.536
No.We decided that a truce

26:21.580 --> 26:23.059
was our best chance at healing.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.539
And she agreed to that?

26:25.453 --> 26:28.325
Frank. I just need a minute.

26:28.369 --> 26:29.675
This isn't over.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.243
Not by a long shot.

26:34.549 --> 26:37.291
Any chance I can get
another margarita to go?

26:37.334 --> 26:38.509
I'll do you
one better.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.033
We already have a team
tequila sponsor.

26:40.076 --> 26:42.383
I'll have my guys
send you a case.
Cheers.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.428
I don't know what your
company's planning to offer

26:44.472 --> 26:46.169
for the naming rights,
but I think

26:46.213 --> 26:48.041
we're gonna put a pretty
big number out there.

26:48.084 --> 26:51.087
Well, you'll beat ours.What do you mean?

26:51.131 --> 26:54.003
You're not actually making
a serious offer, are you?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.570
Oh, good for you.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.007
The rest of us are here
for the swag and the fun.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.270
Really?Yeah.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.795
But, hey,
you do you.

27:06.146 --> 27:09.410
We need to talk.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.194
You need to accept my donation
and renew my membership.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.195
We've been through this.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.067
Your reputation is a wreck.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.938
Period.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.723
And I've got six board members
out there who agree with me.

27:17.766 --> 27:18.898
Now, that's
funny because,

27:18.941 --> 27:20.073
while you were busy

27:20.116 --> 27:21.465
stuffing your face
with my lobster,

27:21.509 --> 27:23.032
I actually spoke to them,
and they seem to think

27:23.076 --> 27:24.512
that I deserve this chance.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.122
I'll bring it up
at the next meeting,

27:26.166 --> 27:27.558
and you won't win.

27:27.602 --> 27:30.387
How about I bring
them in here now?

27:30.431 --> 27:31.911
I can explain to them

27:31.954 --> 27:34.043
how you've been siphoning
money from the club

27:34.087 --> 27:35.218
right into
your pocket.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.611
See, after
our phone call,

27:36.655 --> 27:39.048
I had my contractor dig up
the marina's budgets

27:39.092 --> 27:40.920
and permits, and there are
some discrepancies

27:40.963 --> 27:45.098
here that I'm sure board
members would love to see.

27:45.141 --> 27:46.752
Hmm?

27:46.795 --> 27:48.449
No.

27:49.929 --> 27:53.062
I suppose we could talk
about possible reinstatement.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.590
If you try to come back in,

27:59.634 --> 28:01.288
we'll have you arrested
for trespassing.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.508
Blessed be this fruit.

28:06.206 --> 28:09.252
Uh, so remember that time
they took all of our stuff?

28:09.296 --> 28:10.906
I think they may
have taken the car.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.342
But don't worry,
it was a rental.

28:12.386 --> 28:14.257
With the charger we need
for our dead phone.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.911
Yeah, sorry. I know this
hasn't gone as planned.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.217
It's all my fault.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.306
Kirby was right.
I did come here with an agenda.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.916
I was so busy trying

28:20.960 --> 28:23.614
to even out Blake's bad karma,
I ended up steamrolling Kirby.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.095
I need to go talk to her.
I'm going back in.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.143
Soon as I figure out how.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.931
Employee badge.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.107
I hid it in my...I don't want to know.

28:39.979 --> 28:42.721
I need another 20 bottles
in there for the toast. Come on,

28:42.764 --> 28:43.939
let's go celebrate.
You should've seen

28:43.983 --> 28:45.114
Rex's face.
What's wrong?

28:45.158 --> 28:46.463
I know I told you I'd leave

28:46.507 --> 28:47.943
the past in the past,
but I couldn't.

28:47.987 --> 28:50.554
Are you talking
about the bullet?

28:50.598 --> 28:54.384
Yes. I found out it was the same
caliber that killed Mark.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.125
And when I tried
to confirm

28:56.169 --> 28:58.649
that it was Mack who used it,
I called his fiancé,

28:58.693 --> 29:00.564
who insisted
they were on a trip

29:00.608 --> 29:01.957
the day Mark was killed.

29:02.001 --> 29:03.045
Cristal, that can't be true.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.178
We know that he
was here that day.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.180
I called him here.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.530
Alexis told me she saw him.And you believe her?

29:09.573 --> 29:10.966
Well, she would have
no reason to lie.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.229
When did she ever need a reason?

29:13.273 --> 29:14.796
Well, you can
go ask her yourself.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.493
I'm sure she's
camped out at the bar.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.321
She's here?

29:18.365 --> 29:22.673
Yeah, she told me
that you invited her.

29:22.717 --> 29:23.892
That you two had called a truce.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.372
Oh, did she?

29:25.415 --> 29:29.593
Well, the truce is about
to be called off in a big way.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.476
Seriously?
I don't need an encore,

29:42.519 --> 29:44.478
and I already told you
I'm not leaving.

29:44.521 --> 29:47.524
I'm not here to convince you
to leave, I promise.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.222
I am actually here to apologize.

29:49.265 --> 29:52.660
I know that I can be
a bit pushy.

29:52.703 --> 29:55.837
I think you mean a lot pushy,
like aggressively so.

29:55.881 --> 30:00.189
Okay, fine, but I swear
I really just came here to help.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.670
I just forgot to listen
to what you wanted,

30:02.713 --> 30:03.932
and though everyone else
is right

30:03.976 --> 30:05.455
for wanting you to come back,

30:05.499 --> 30:08.850
that doesn't mean you're wrong
for wanting to stay, Kirby.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.331
I want you to be able
to make your own decisions.

30:11.374 --> 30:14.769
And if your next decision
is going to Sri Lanka,

30:14.813 --> 30:16.684
then at least

30:16.727 --> 30:20.557
I was here to say
I'm sorry and goodbye.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.178
All right, everyone,
and before we leave,

30:32.221 --> 30:34.833
let's get down to business
and talk naming rights.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.183
And I think it's time
we honor today's win.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.620
How about a shot for every goal
the Atlantix scored?

30:42.449 --> 30:43.711
MICHAEL:
Oh, come on.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.931
Where's that enthusiasm?

30:45.974 --> 30:47.628
You didn't
just come here

30:47.671 --> 30:49.804
for a free ride on a plane,
did you?

30:51.632 --> 30:53.547
I know I speak
for everyone when I say

30:53.590 --> 30:55.810
we appreciate the hospitality,

30:55.854 --> 30:58.291
but our involvement was
a show of respect to Jeff.

30:58.334 --> 30:59.770
MICHAEL:
Well, if you really

30:59.814 --> 31:01.903
respected Jeff, you would've
voiced your concerns

31:01.947 --> 31:04.863
before you wasted
this club's time and money.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.954
Since that ship has sailed,
what do you want from us now?

31:08.997 --> 31:11.608
Honest conversation.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.654
Well, no one here,
except maybe the hotel guy,

31:13.697 --> 31:15.177
is going to drop
hundreds of millions

31:15.221 --> 31:17.788
of dollars for the right to put
their logo on a stadium

31:17.832 --> 31:20.095
when it's advertising
no one may ever see.

31:20.139 --> 31:22.445
BOB:
Let's be honest,
your stadium is in the center

31:22.489 --> 31:23.925
of a crap neighborhood,

31:23.969 --> 31:26.928
and if your team folds,
we wouldn't even be able

31:26.972 --> 31:28.930
to repurpose the stadium
for anything worthwhile.

31:30.671 --> 31:33.195
Where you see
a crap neighborhood,

31:33.239 --> 31:36.024
I see a community
that transcends this sport.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.113
If we asked our fans

31:38.157 --> 31:40.594
to donate their money to put
their name on our stadium,

31:40.637 --> 31:42.726
we'd reach our goal
in five minutes.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.120
Because unlike you,
they're real people

31:45.164 --> 31:47.209
that have come together
to support a community

31:47.253 --> 31:50.996
in a city overlooked
by greedy corporate bosses.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.217
Now get off our damn plane.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.220
ADAM:
So you failed.

31:58.264 --> 32:00.135
No, no.
The mission changed.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.355
So, technically
it was a success.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.748
I'm not sure Anders would
agree that his daughter

32:04.792 --> 32:07.186
going off to Sri Lanka with
some fake guru is a success.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.622
Why do you care?

32:08.665 --> 32:10.972
You only agreed to help
so that you could get back in

32:11.016 --> 32:12.626
with the devil
known as Dad.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.368
Hey, I think you'd feel
differently about things

32:15.411 --> 32:16.891
if you knew the truth.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.676
Okay, well, I mean, we've got
about a week of walking left

32:19.720 --> 32:21.504
until we hit civilization,
so please enlighten me

32:21.548 --> 32:23.245
on our murderous father.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.509
All right. Okay.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.337
Blake did what he did

32:28.381 --> 32:31.993
only after he found out that
Mack shot Mark Jennings.

32:32.037 --> 32:35.170
And that gunshot spooked
Cristal's horse,

32:35.214 --> 32:37.694
it threw her,
causing a miscarriage.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.174
So Blake's been
acting from

32:39.218 --> 32:41.176
a sense of pain that neither one
of us can comprehend.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.004
I understand.

32:43.048 --> 32:46.703
It's still a big step to murder,

32:46.747 --> 32:49.010
just maybe not a giant leap.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.403
He's still our father.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.318
And it's not like you've
never forgiven him before.

32:52.361 --> 32:55.190
And you got to live in
the manor your whole life.

32:55.234 --> 32:58.237
So why is it so bad for me
to want the same thing?

33:01.153 --> 33:02.676
You guys sure do walk slow.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.548
Kirby? What are
you doing here?

33:05.592 --> 33:07.028
You told me to make
my own decisions.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.725
That means Joel doesn't
get to make them either.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.031
So I, uh,

33:10.075 --> 33:11.206
stole his phone
and called my dad,

33:11.250 --> 33:12.381
and he'll be here
in a few minutes.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.992
From the manor? How?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.645
He put a tracker on your phone
or something, I don't know.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.299
He left the manor
a few hours ago.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.129
So, do you want a ride home?

33:21.173 --> 33:22.261
Oh, please.
Yes, I feel like

33:22.304 --> 33:24.350
this burlap sack
is giving me hives.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.569
Okay, cool.

33:26.613 --> 33:27.744
Here you go.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.050
Thank you.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.588
Alexis! Stop!

33:45.632 --> 33:46.894
I just want to talk.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.243
Yesterday you
kicked me out.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.636
Now you won't
let me leave.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.290
I'm starting
to worry about you.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.770
They say the mind is the first
thing to go, but in your case,

33:53.814 --> 33:54.815
it might be
the third thing,

33:54.858 --> 33:57.252
after taste in men
and fashion sense.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.775
Now that I know
that it wasn't Mack

33:58.819 --> 34:00.255
who fired the bullet
that killed Mark,

34:00.299 --> 34:02.083
and it certainly
wasn't a hunter

34:02.127 --> 34:04.955
on our property,
I wonder: who did?

34:04.999 --> 34:06.783
What are you blathering on
about now?

34:06.827 --> 34:09.221
You lied to sneak into
the manor yesterday.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.570
You lied to
get in today.

34:10.613 --> 34:13.312
But worse, you lied about
seeing Mack on a day

34:13.355 --> 34:14.443
he wasn't even in town.

34:14.487 --> 34:18.969
You can't prove any of this.

Way to drop the hammer.
Insulting the reps

36:23.964 --> 36:26.401
wouldn't have been
my first move, but you're lucky

36:26.445 --> 36:29.099
everyone's loving the video's
anti-corporate vibe.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.232
Fan buy-ins are pouring in.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.930
Season ticket requests
are blowing up,

36:33.974 --> 36:35.802
because people want
to see their team

36:35.845 --> 36:38.239
with their name

36:38.283 --> 36:41.242
AXFC ain't going nowhere.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.939
That sounds like the mindset
of a owner

36:42.983 --> 36:44.419
who's here
for the right reasons.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.768
And to be clear,

36:45.812 --> 36:47.422
that wasn't luck.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.684
Who do you think

36:48.728 --> 36:49.816
shot that video,

36:49.859 --> 36:51.948
then leaked it
into the right hands?

36:51.992 --> 36:54.386
That was you?With a little help
from my friends.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.126
SAM:
I got to say,

36:56.170 --> 36:57.867
I may have a career
in filmmaking.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.695
Did you notice
how sometimes I drop the angle,

36:59.739 --> 37:01.349
like I'm not trying to record?

37:01.393 --> 37:03.264
You're the Tarantino
of Internet videos.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.919
With your eye, Culhane's
message, my contacts,

37:05.962 --> 37:08.791
we turned this Hail Mary pass
into a viral touchdown.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.794
Uh, we're totally...

37:11.838 --> 37:13.274
a dream team.

37:13.318 --> 37:16.799
Um, a dream team
that wasn't real.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.323
We were role-playing.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.802
And not in the fun way.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.848
Look, if you want
to be with me,

37:21.891 --> 37:23.241
I'm gonna need you
to give me more.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.156
Of you.

37:29.682 --> 37:30.683
Okay.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.468
Baylor.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.821
It's Sam.

37:38.865 --> 37:39.953
My middle name,

37:39.996 --> 37:41.781
it's... Baylor.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.351
I'm sorry I've
been holding back.

37:46.394 --> 37:49.049
I promise I'll be better.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.443
Baylor?

37:51.486 --> 37:52.879
Really?

37:52.922 --> 37:54.881
Did your parents
not like you?

37:54.924 --> 37:56.665
FALLON:
A promise is a promise.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.363
And I am a woman
of my word,

37:58.406 --> 38:00.103
so I will go talk
to Blake for you.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.714
Now, I can't promise
that it'll help,

38:01.757 --> 38:03.977
because, at the end of the day,
he's still Blake,

38:04.020 --> 38:06.109
so I wouldn't give up
your secret loft just yet.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.546
Hey. Don't bother.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.417
He's either going to forgive me
or he's not.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.027
Nothing you say is gonna matter.

38:11.071 --> 38:15.075
And that's not the reason I
went on this little adventure.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.337
Then why do it?

38:16.381 --> 38:17.773
So you could stand next to Joel

38:17.817 --> 38:19.471
to make yourself
seem less insane?

38:20.602 --> 38:22.082
No, it was still about family,

38:22.125 --> 38:23.518
just not about Father.

38:23.562 --> 38:25.477
I thought this would be
a great opportunity

38:25.520 --> 38:27.957
to get away from all this and...

38:28.001 --> 38:30.090
really get to know my sister.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.836
And my wife.

38:36.879 --> 38:40.143
You just had to do it.

38:42.755 --> 38:45.061
Hey. Um,

38:45.105 --> 38:47.412
I just wanted to say thanks
again for coming today.

38:47.455 --> 38:51.111
Even though I didn't really
need you to.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.547
Yeah. I know that now.

38:52.591 --> 38:53.679
I'm just relieved

38:53.722 --> 38:55.202
that you decided, on your own,

38:55.245 --> 38:56.595
to come home.

38:56.638 --> 38:59.206
Well, you might have
majorly embarrassed yourself

38:59.249 --> 39:01.600
along the way, but I think
you've grown a bit, too.

39:01.643 --> 39:03.602
Yeah, I doubt that.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.779
Growth isn't really my thing.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.438
Fallon?

39:13.481 --> 39:14.656
Everything okay?

39:15.657 --> 39:17.485
Yeah.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.487
Yeah, I'm just...

39:19.531 --> 39:22.055
worried you may be right.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.318
Maybe growth ismy thing.

I wanted to write

39:39.855 --> 39:43.729
About Mack
and Cristal and your baby.

39:43.772 --> 39:46.471
I know the full story.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.168
It doesn't excuse your actions,

39:48.211 --> 39:50.605
but you could have at least
told me, so I could have tried

39:50.649 --> 39:52.346
to understand
why you did what you did,

39:52.390 --> 39:55.349
but clearly you don't trust me.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.003
You're just willing to use me

to a few crazy people,

in the mirror.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.360
I know now

40:06.404 --> 40:08.928
to my part
in our troubled relationship,

40:08.971 --> 40:11.757
but I can't keep forgiving you
for everything.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.761
I am done enabling
your self-serving behavior,

40:15.804 --> 40:18.764

blaming you for mine.

the cycle of bad behavior,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.639
at least from me,

40:24.683 --> 40:27.207
I need to distance myself
from you,

40:27.250 --> 40:29.252
which is why I'm moving out
of the manor.
