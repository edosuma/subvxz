TO BE A SKEPTIC IS GOOD,

40:50.800 --> 40:56.767
BUT WITH E.P. "TOM" SAWYER,

40:56.767 --> 41:01.467
TO BE HONEST, THERE'S NO BEING

40:56.767 --> 41:01.467
A SKEPTIC OUT THERE AT ALL.

41:01.467 --> 41:03.567
I MEAN, IF YOU ARE A SKEPTIC,

41:01.467 --> 41:03.567
GO OUT THERE.

41:03.567 --> 41:05.067
YOU WON'T BE ANYMORE.

WOULD BELIEVE ANYONE ELSE

41:15.267 --> 41:18.767
THAT TOLD ME THIS STORY,

41:18.767 --> 41:22.100
BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU,

41:18.767 --> 41:22.100
AND YOU FEEL IT,

41:22.100 --> 41:24.700
AND YOU GO THROUGH THE EMOTIONS

41:22.100 --> 41:24.700
AND THE PHYSICAL CHANGES,

41:24.700 --> 41:26.933
AND THE HAIR STANDS UP

41:24.700 --> 41:26.933
ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK,

41:26.933 --> 41:32.267
AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

41:32.267 --> 41:33.933
IT WILL MAKE YOU BELIEVE.

I'VE NEVER BEEN MADE

42:03.533 --> 42:07.400
TO FEEL SO THREATENED

42:07.400 --> 42:10.667
BY SOMETHING THAT I COULD

42:07.400 --> 42:10.667
NOT PHYSICALLY SEE

42:10.667 --> 42:14.167
OR PHYSICALLY HEAR OR EXPLAIN.
