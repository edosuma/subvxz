NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:06.625 --> 02:08.541
Be careful!

02:08.625 --> 02:10.791
Come on, move a little faster.

02:11.541 --> 02:12.375
-Yes!
-Yes!

02:12.458 --> 02:13.958
Yes!

02:16.500 --> 02:17.666
-Oh, fuck.
-Oh, shit.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.000
Oh, man.

02:21.666 --> 02:24.791
-Okay, it was close, man. It was close.
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.083
Oh! Oh!

02:27.166 --> 02:29.708
Give me your hand.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.208
-Here.
-Thanks.

02:35.208 --> 02:36.083
Wait.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.583
You asshole!

02:42.583 --> 02:44.791
-Woo!
-Well then.

02:48.083 --> 02:50.041
-Here I come!
-Oh!

02:54.083 --> 02:55.875
-Hey, guys!
-Whoo!

02:55.958 --> 02:58.625
-Come on, attack! Yeah!
-Hey!

02:58.708 --> 03:01.166
-Oh, bastard.
-Yeah!

03:04.583 --> 03:07.583
-Bring it on. Come on, get up taller.
-Are you sure?

03:07.666 --> 03:09.166
You can still back out.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.416
What am I doing?

03:11.208 --> 03:12.333
Ooh!

03:12.958 --> 03:14.208
-Wow, oh, oh.
-Oh, oh.

03:16.291 --> 03:17.750
Hey, hey!

03:20.458 --> 03:22.000
Okay, okay… Oh!

03:30.291 --> 03:31.125
Genius.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.875
Oh, wow.

03:32.958 --> 03:35.458
Wow, Stefan. You're a real woodsman.

03:35.541 --> 03:36.375
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.916
I thought you were a biology teacher,
not a Boy Scout.

03:39.000 --> 03:39.875
I'm both.

03:40.458 --> 03:41.375
Great.

03:46.125 --> 03:49.000
Cold, huh?
At least the sun's coming out now, right?

03:55.583 --> 03:56.791
What the hell was that?

04:02.875 --> 04:04.166
So it's… hunting season?

04:05.958 --> 04:06.791
Okay.

04:08.708 --> 04:09.708
Okay.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.583
So, if you're up for it,
I have a small surprise for you.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.875
-It's a bit of a hike, but it's worth it.
-Oh.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.958
-I'm not up for it.
-Oh, Vincent.

04:36.125 --> 04:37.250
Fantastic.

04:43.875 --> 04:45.208
Great idea, Stefan.

04:47.625 --> 04:51.250
I used to come here with my dad
all the time. He loved the forest.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.000
Mm.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.208
I wouldn't wanna fall.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.916
Well, I'm ready to go back down.

05:07.208 --> 05:10.625
Yeah, give us a second, okay?

05:27.458 --> 05:29.833
We need the presentation by next week.

05:29.916 --> 05:32.750
I don't think they got it.
Ines never delivered anything on time.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.250
I can already see myself pulling
an all-nighter just to get it done.

05:37.291 --> 05:38.375
Do what you have to.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.500
-Problems with Lisa?
-No, we're talking about someone else.

05:46.166 --> 05:49.500
Your fiancée is the best graphic designer
we've had thus far.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.083
Any news about the job?

05:53.625 --> 05:54.541
What job?

05:56.833 --> 05:58.291
The job for me?

05:59.958 --> 06:01.791
It's in the investors' hands now.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.125
They either get out of bed
on the right side tomorrow

06:05.208 --> 06:07.125
and we get the financing, or not.

06:07.666 --> 06:08.500
Okay.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.375
I have little influence on that.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.125
In the end, it comes down to good luck.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.041
Yeah, I get it.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.375
Well, sorry for asking.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.833
Like I said, Roman,
I have little influence over it.

06:32.666 --> 06:33.833
Look.

06:36.458 --> 06:37.291
Aww.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.375
Cute.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.166
Hmm.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.458
What a cute souvenir for our trip.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.708
-Careful, it gets steep again.
-Yeah.

07:06.875 --> 07:10.041
"Five cool guys die in a lame
accident during a bachelor party."

07:10.625 --> 07:13.833
"Taken in the prime of their lives."

07:13.916 --> 07:15.583
Hey, stay focused, guys.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.250
Aye-aye.

07:18.833 --> 07:19.666
Careful.

07:22.833 --> 07:23.666
You all right?

07:27.875 --> 07:30.125
-Hold up, guys.
-What is it?

07:32.958 --> 07:34.541
What's taking you guys so long?

07:35.125 --> 07:37.125
-Roman!
-Huh?

07:37.708 --> 07:39.916
-Faster, faster!
-Be right there!

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Come on, let's go.

07:44.833 --> 07:45.666
Careful.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.333
-You got it?
-Hmm.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.375
I'm afraid of heights.

08:09.791 --> 08:10.750
Whew.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.041
Here!

08:25.041 --> 08:26.000
Come on!

08:29.375 --> 08:30.250
Look at me!

08:44.625 --> 08:47.083
Damn!

08:48.958 --> 08:50.041
Everything all right?

08:51.041 --> 08:53.333
Yeah.Thanks.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.250
Whew.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.333
Fuck.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.625
Get up.

09:08.666 --> 09:10.041
Whoa!

09:16.458 --> 09:18.083
You all right?

09:18.750 --> 09:20.625
Yeah. Now I'm better.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.333
Okay.

09:22.416 --> 09:24.583
-Let's get going.
-Yeah.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.125
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.541
Hey, what happened?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.208
Got a bit too drunk last night after all?

09:56.166 --> 09:57.916
No. Why?

10:00.041 --> 10:02.458
I slipped. Vinny grabbed me.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.333
Heroic act.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.166
Oh, I see.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.750
Well, then, keep it up… hero.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.625
Aren't our phones for photos?

10:21.375 --> 10:22.583
Just checking something.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.666
Any news from Ines?

10:27.916 --> 10:31.375
How many nude pics
do you get, dude, per week?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.333
Not enough.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.166
Since when do you like girls?

10:38.625 --> 10:40.125
Since I met your mother.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.083
Oh, such a dumbass.

10:43.458 --> 10:46.083
-Shall we move on?
-Yeah.

11:05.166 --> 11:09.000
Don't worry too much.
Investors like us. They'll like you too.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.083
I'll follow up on it for you. I promise.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.708
Did they decide if I get hired? I thought
it depended on the next round of funding.

11:16.708 --> 11:20.666
It'll be settled before the wedding.
I wouldn't screw it up for my brother.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.875
Good?

11:27.958 --> 11:30.083
Do you have to be like that again?

11:30.166 --> 11:34.250
Let them be, man. His little brother
is getting married. That's damn cool.

11:34.791 --> 11:38.291
No? And a marriage that will last.
Isn't that lucky?

11:38.375 --> 11:39.375
Jealous?

11:40.541 --> 11:41.625
-What?
-It's true.

11:42.541 --> 11:44.666
-Well, aren't you single?
-Yes.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.833
And it's quite impressive, thank you.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.125
-So don't screw it up, Roman, okay?
-Yeah.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.083
I'll try my best.

11:56.958 --> 12:00.208
-I thought you already got the job.
-Yeah, it's a done deal.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.250
Okay. If you need any help, let me know.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.166
Okay.

12:43.791 --> 12:44.791
Thank you.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.916
LOVE, LISA

13:06.833 --> 13:08.000
Yes!

13:08.583 --> 13:10.666
We made it. Thank God!

13:10.750 --> 13:11.791
Sorry, Roman.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.291
I'm just exhausted.

13:18.583 --> 13:19.416
Oh.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.416
-That was much closer this time.
-Yeah.

13:30.125 --> 13:33.125
So how do hunters know
where they're allowed to hunt or not?

13:34.083 --> 13:35.958
This isn't a hunting ground anyway.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.583
Shit.

13:40.541 --> 13:41.583
What is it?

13:41.666 --> 13:42.541
Vincent!

13:43.208 --> 13:44.041
Oh, shit.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.458
Where did that come from?

13:51.541 --> 13:52.875
From somewhere back there.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.791
-Do you have a first aid kit?
-Yes, in the car. Let's go.

13:57.666 --> 14:01.333
-Hey!
-Hello! We're down here! Stop!

14:01.416 --> 14:03.625
Don't shoot, okay? We are humans!

14:03.708 --> 14:05.583
Shit, let's get out of here.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.250
Careful. Here. I'll take this off.

14:14.083 --> 14:17.125
-Careful, slowly.
-Thanks. Jacket off.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.875
Fuck, this can't be happening.

14:26.458 --> 14:27.375
Hurry up.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.208
Hey, hold this.

14:36.416 --> 14:39.041
Keep still now. Talk to me.

14:39.958 --> 14:42.166
Do you and Lisa want to have kids?

14:43.625 --> 14:47.166
-Only if they're as cute as you.
-Ah. That's pretty unlikely.

14:48.291 --> 14:51.333
-Hey, guys, hurry up. Stop yapping.
-We're almost done.

14:51.916 --> 14:52.750
Hey!

14:53.708 --> 14:54.875
Help!

14:58.875 --> 15:00.125
Good. That'll do for now.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.791
Okay. Now to the ER, okay?

15:01.875 --> 15:03.083
Get in, come on.

15:05.125 --> 15:05.958
Fuck!

15:06.541 --> 15:07.750
Hey!

15:08.333 --> 15:10.625
Stop shooting now, you stupid idiots!

15:10.708 --> 15:12.958
You've already hit one of us!

15:13.041 --> 15:15.458
It's impossible they didn't hear us. Hey!

15:15.541 --> 15:17.458
Shit! What are they doing?

15:20.208 --> 15:21.291
Fuck.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.083
Shit, guys, flat tire.

15:23.666 --> 15:24.541
Shit!

15:25.625 --> 15:26.833
Take cover.

15:27.416 --> 15:30.416
Maybe they're not hunters.
Come on, get down. Get down!

15:30.500 --> 15:31.416
] Down!

15:32.833 --> 15:33.833
Keep calm.

15:33.916 --> 15:35.208
This isn't real.

15:46.916 --> 15:49.541
-I need to go to the hospital.
-How with a flat tire?

15:50.125 --> 15:52.458
Stefan, how far to the goddamn road?

15:52.541 --> 15:53.500
Twelve miles or so.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.500
But it's an old country road.
Nobody's ever on it.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.583
Yeah, but better than just sitting here.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.375
What a load of shit.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.041
-It has to be an accident.
-I don't know.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.166
-Why would they attack us?
-We can't know for sure.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.166
-So which way to the road?
-Forget the road! No one will be there.

16:22.750 --> 16:23.583
Okay.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.500
What are we gonna do?

16:30.125 --> 16:30.958
EMERGENCY CALL

16:35.250 --> 16:37.541
-We have no service.
-Oh, fuck!

16:43.708 --> 16:47.791
Okay, let's pretend it was neither
an accident nor a fucking game. Then what?

16:47.875 --> 16:49.583
How could it have been an accident?

16:49.666 --> 16:52.875
-Two shots straight in our direction!
-Damn it, Peter!

16:52.958 --> 16:55.333
If it's some kind of stupid game,
then…

16:55.416 --> 16:57.625
-Keep calm.
-Vincent, please calm down, okay?

16:57.708 --> 16:59.041
Okay.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.958
Let's all get in.
We can still drive with a flat, okay?

17:02.041 --> 17:03.500
-Okay.
-Okay, yes. Yeah.

17:03.583 --> 17:04.416
Okay.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.125
-Oh, fuck!
-Keep down!

17:11.541 --> 17:12.791
-Everyone okay?
-Shit!

17:13.708 --> 17:15.166
-Yes. Vincent?
-Yeah.

17:17.666 --> 17:18.791
Oh, shit!

17:20.000 --> 17:21.458
I think they're trying to kill us.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.166
A sharpshooter.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.458
Shit.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.875
We have to get into the forest.
It'll be safer there.

17:31.958 --> 17:33.833
-Okay.
-Yeah.

17:33.916 --> 17:37.375
He'll lose our trail in there, I hope.
Can you manage that?

17:37.458 --> 17:40.125
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. One after the other.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.458
-Stefan, you ready?
-Yeah.

17:41.541 --> 17:42.916
-Let's go!
-Go!

17:51.750 --> 17:53.333
Shit! Roman!

17:54.000 --> 17:54.833
My phone!

17:58.458 --> 17:59.708
It's important.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.583
Quiet.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.583
-I don't see anybody.
-You sure?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.291
Fuck!

19:02.666 --> 19:03.500
Oh, great.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.291
Thanks.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.791
What's that? You see that?

19:19.333 --> 19:20.250
It's weird.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.250
Who cares, man?

19:29.833 --> 19:30.958
Okay.

19:31.041 --> 19:31.875
Guys?

19:32.458 --> 19:33.458
What's the plan?

19:34.083 --> 19:35.041
Hmm?

19:36.083 --> 19:39.416
Which direction was the mountain
we came from? The tower?

19:40.500 --> 19:41.333
Stefan?

19:42.416 --> 19:45.291
What about compass directions?
Where's the closest town?

19:45.375 --> 19:46.291
Man, I don't know.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.791
That's great.
It just wasn't enough for you, guys.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.875
Boozing in a bar
and a round of strippers.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.291
Sorry.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.541
Don't mushrooms only grow
on the north-facing side of trees?

19:56.625 --> 19:59.583
Some grow on south-facing slopes.
Others everywhere. That won't help us.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.833
Right. That's educational and fascinating
to know where mushrooms grow,

20:03.916 --> 20:07.000
Where would we go if we knew
on which side and in which direction?

20:07.083 --> 20:10.250
Look, what we need is a plan.
Don't you have any ideas?

20:10.333 --> 20:11.208
Huh?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.208
There was the highway, right?
We could flag someone down.

20:17.291 --> 20:21.041
I saw a large road. I'm sure of it.
when we were up on the tower.

20:21.833 --> 20:24.208
-Yes, he's right, guys.
-Didn't you take a picture?

20:24.833 --> 20:26.041
Yeah, I did.

20:31.708 --> 20:32.541
Here.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.375
-This picture?
-Yeah. To the right here.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.541
But it's not as close as it looks.
It's in the southwest.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.208
Okay, that direction.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.000
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:52.541 --> 20:54.000
If our woodsman says so then.

20:55.541 --> 20:56.541
You okay?

20:57.708 --> 20:58.791
Thanks.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.250
Ouch! Fuck! Ah, shit!

21:06.583 --> 21:08.250
-What is it?
-Shit, guys!

21:08.833 --> 21:10.291
I'm stuck. Can you come help me?

21:13.833 --> 21:15.666
Careful, don't use force.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.833
-Shall we? Now.
-Good.

21:17.916 --> 21:19.333
-Come on.
-Yeah.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.541
-Just great.
-Hey.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.041
Okay.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.458
Ah! Fuck!

22:08.041 --> 22:08.916
Roman!

22:10.333 --> 22:11.291
Lisa?

22:28.875 --> 22:29.833
Let's sit down.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.416
Maybe that was it.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.458
No one's out there.

23:02.416 --> 23:04.208
We haven't seen anybody yet.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.833
And now we are a hunter's game.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.000
Let's go.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.000
Weren't we here before?

23:32.791 --> 23:33.625
No.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.041
-You sure?
-Yes.

23:47.583 --> 23:48.666
Oh, shit.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.458
Highway's somewhere that way.

23:57.333 --> 23:58.250
Okay.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.458
There. Here's good.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.125
Careful. Here.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.250
Go.

24:25.958 --> 24:28.000
There you go, then. Okay.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.875
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

24:36.708 --> 24:37.916
-Fuck!
-Here.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.583
Damn it! I got it. Out of the way!

24:40.666 --> 24:41.625
-Hey, hey!
-Get off!

24:41.708 --> 24:43.375
-Come on. Shut the fuck up!
-What?

24:43.458 --> 24:45.083
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

24:49.625 --> 24:50.541
Wait, hey, wait.

24:52.833 --> 24:53.666
Here.

24:55.416 --> 24:56.500
For your shoe, okay?

24:58.708 --> 25:00.666
We have to work together, okay?

25:00.750 --> 25:03.208
Mm-hmm. Go fuck yourself, okay?

25:03.916 --> 25:05.541
Take off your shoe now.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.541
-Come on.
-Yeah!

25:34.791 --> 25:36.166
Just fucking great.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.041
I can't believe this shit.

25:44.458 --> 25:45.375
Okay.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.000
He's getting on my nerves.

25:58.666 --> 26:00.041
Thanks for waiting.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.583
Do you think we lost him?

26:08.666 --> 26:09.541
Maybe.

26:10.333 --> 26:11.708
Sure, or maybe not.

26:12.833 --> 26:16.000
But if he wanted to shoot us,
he'd have done so already, right?

26:17.208 --> 26:18.458
Wait a second.

26:19.041 --> 26:19.916
What?

26:23.041 --> 26:24.083
Don't you hear?

26:25.208 --> 26:26.166
A helicopter.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.666
Hey, hey, hey!

26:33.750 --> 26:36.000
-Hey!
-Not so loud, man!

26:37.125 --> 26:39.625
But I feel like being loud.
I want to leave!

26:39.708 --> 26:40.916
Shut your damn mouth!

26:43.875 --> 26:44.833
Fuck!

26:56.458 --> 26:57.291
I'm done.

26:57.375 --> 26:58.625
Oh, man!

27:04.875 --> 27:08.541
How long have we not been shot at now?
We can do this!

27:09.625 --> 27:10.458
Let's go!

27:20.458 --> 27:21.291
Hey.

27:24.666 --> 27:25.500
Vincent.

27:27.833 --> 27:28.666
Please.

28:13.708 --> 28:14.666
Which way now?

28:16.041 --> 28:16.958
That way.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.416
Okay.

28:20.250 --> 28:21.416
You sure, woodsman?

28:22.708 --> 28:23.541
I'm sure.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.000
Hey, guys.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.750
-What is it?
-There's someone.

29:00.333 --> 29:01.166
Hello!

29:02.208 --> 29:04.125
Hello! Hey!

29:04.875 --> 29:06.125
We need help!

29:07.625 --> 29:08.458
Hello!

29:15.333 --> 29:17.583
Excuse us, we need some help, please.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.458
Our friend's been shot.

30:28.666 --> 30:31.291
Oh, fuck! Shit!

30:40.708 --> 30:42.125
-Shit
-What is it?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.208
I twisted my ankle.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.083
Shit.

30:46.166 --> 30:47.583
What about Stefan?

30:48.416 --> 30:49.250
You saw it.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.500
He's dead! The cunt just popped him.

30:52.583 --> 30:55.375
-No, he's not. Why would she--
-Half his head was gone!

30:55.458 --> 30:56.666
No, that's insane!

31:01.333 --> 31:02.416
It is what it is now.

31:03.583 --> 31:06.333
-We need to go! Come on! Go!
-Wait, wait, wait!

31:07.666 --> 31:08.583
Wait.

31:09.083 --> 31:12.791
-Jesus, pull yourself together for once!
-Give him a second, okay?

31:12.875 --> 31:13.875
I'll watch out.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.750
Just a second. One second.

31:18.291 --> 31:20.375
-Are you gonna be fine?
-Yes, I will.

31:20.916 --> 31:21.916
It's nothing.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.291
Oh, shit!

31:32.625 --> 31:33.458
Holy shit.

31:34.708 --> 31:37.416
Excuse me, that's not nothing.
That's pretty fucking bad!

31:37.500 --> 31:38.833
-Quiet.
-Be quiet!

31:38.916 --> 31:40.125
Hey!

31:40.208 --> 31:41.500
Fuck!

31:41.583 --> 31:42.541
We're fucked!

31:43.208 --> 31:46.166
All right? How are you going to run away
if we're shot at again?

31:46.250 --> 31:47.916
If you have any idea, please, share!

31:50.208 --> 31:51.833
What are you trying to say?

31:52.708 --> 31:53.541
Huh?

31:55.625 --> 31:56.666
Erm…

31:58.500 --> 31:59.541
Every man for himself.

32:02.916 --> 32:07.208
The four of us go in different directions.
She can't split into four guys.

32:07.291 --> 32:10.125
-What about Albert?
-Didn't you just say you'd be fine?

32:10.708 --> 32:13.000
Guys, we need to stick together. Please!

32:14.083 --> 32:16.083
We can't endanger ourselves either.

32:19.833 --> 32:20.833
Endanger?

32:24.541 --> 32:25.708
Roman.

32:25.791 --> 32:27.000
Vincent.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.666
Don't leave me behind, okay?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.250
Dude, of course not.

32:37.916 --> 32:39.458
Please, chill out, guys. Stay calm.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.291
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

32:41.375 --> 32:43.458
-Sure.
-She's just a woman, right?

32:43.541 --> 32:45.708
Who has a rifle
and has been shooting at us.

32:46.250 --> 32:50.000
And what do we have? A pocket knife.
A cell phone with no signal or battery.

32:50.083 --> 32:52.791
You were shot
and he can't walk properly.

32:52.875 --> 32:56.083
The only guy who knew his way
around the forest is gone. Fuck!

32:58.541 --> 33:00.208
Why did she have to kill him?

33:00.750 --> 33:02.666
That's enough! Okay?

33:05.041 --> 33:06.875
Anyway, I'm good to go. Come on.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.083
Let's go.
What are you waiting for?

33:13.958 --> 33:15.791
-Let's get out of here.
-Roman…

33:17.791 --> 33:19.083
Your brother's a problem.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.750
Okay. But he is my brother.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.625
Whatever that means, pal.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.666
Ow.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.583
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

33:45.916 --> 33:47.083
Just distract me.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.708
-Number-guessing?
-Okay.

33:53.416 --> 33:54.583
The bigger number wins.

33:59.541 --> 34:00.916
-Eight.
-Three.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.250
I stand no chance against you.

34:07.458 --> 34:10.208
Tell me something  from your life
that I don't know yet.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.166
I'm a very shallow and selfish person.

34:14.833 --> 34:18.250
That I already knew.
Good thing I'm not marrying you.

34:20.416 --> 34:21.333
For sure.

34:23.083 --> 34:25.958
-I should give you the bracelet back.
-Don't you dare.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.125
It's a symbol of our undying love, Roman.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.375
Has Albert got in touch yet?

34:43.333 --> 34:45.958
Oh, he, huh…
He said he thinks it's a good idea.

34:46.041 --> 34:49.000
-But it'll take a while.
-Okay.

34:49.625 --> 34:50.458
Okay?

34:52.458 --> 34:56.541
-And how do you like the idea?
-It's good. It's a good company.

34:59.708 --> 35:01.625
Yeah, depends on what you're looking for.

35:03.416 --> 35:05.041
And by "you" you mean me?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.625
Just don't let yourself
get screwed over, okay?

35:13.208 --> 35:14.125
I won't.

35:15.875 --> 35:17.416
But you're happy there too, right?

35:18.041 --> 35:20.208
Yes, but I'm not his little brother.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.500
Just take care of yourself, okay?

35:27.541 --> 35:29.500
I want to work for him, not marry him.

35:30.208 --> 35:31.666
Could you, legally speaking?

35:32.916 --> 35:33.958
Be careful now.

35:34.541 --> 35:37.250
You better not say another word because,
you know what?

35:37.333 --> 35:40.625
I think I missed a spot-- Yeah, ooh.
That's a big spot, actually. Wait.

35:40.708 --> 35:43.666
You jerk!

36:12.375 --> 36:13.291
Are you all right?

36:14.416 --> 36:15.333
Amazing.

36:41.791 --> 36:43.500
Let's go. It was nothing.

36:56.833 --> 36:57.666
Come on!

36:58.750 --> 36:59.708
Move it!

37:12.333 --> 37:13.166
Hey!

37:21.208 --> 37:22.541
Careful.

37:30.708 --> 37:31.708
Uh?

37:36.833 --> 37:37.875
Awesome.

37:38.541 --> 37:40.083
Is this the road we came from?

37:42.750 --> 37:44.833
That was in the exact opposite direction.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.375
How would you even know that?

37:50.750 --> 37:51.833
Okay, come on.

37:52.333 --> 37:53.250
Let's go.

37:59.166 --> 38:00.500
-Can you go on?
-Yeah.

38:01.166 --> 38:02.083
I'm okay.

38:58.791 --> 38:59.625
Hey.

39:07.208 --> 39:08.333
I can't believe it.

39:31.958 --> 39:32.791
Oh.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.833
You have to call the police.
We don't have a signal.

39:38.916 --> 39:40.166
What? Police? Why?

39:46.250 --> 39:47.375
Uh, we were hiking.

39:48.833 --> 39:51.583
And there was this woman at the lake. And…

39:56.458 --> 39:58.125
Can you just call the police now?

39:59.333 --> 40:02.708
There's no signal here either.
We just have a landline.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.333
-Fuck.
-Doesn't always work.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.500
Do you know a woman living nearby?

40:34.166 --> 40:38.333
Well, hikers often get lost.
Especially during the winter.

40:38.416 --> 40:42.333
Mostly older visitors from far away.
They probably underestimate the forest.

40:42.416 --> 40:45.166
-Did you not hear the shots?
-Shots?

40:45.250 --> 40:47.083
Yeah, exactly.

40:49.666 --> 40:51.166
Ah! Well yeah.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.500
-Hunting accidents occur now and then.
-Quiet.

40:57.666 --> 41:00.291
You guys look really freaking tired.

41:00.375 --> 41:04.125
This is my bachelor party.
I'm getting married soon.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.958
911, what's your emergency?

41:08.041 --> 41:08.958
Uh, hello.

41:09.041 --> 41:12.208
We were shot at and-- and actually,
one of us is dead already.

41:12.291 --> 41:13.833
We're in the national park.

41:13.916 --> 41:15.916
In a hut. What's the location?

41:18.166 --> 41:20.291
Get down!

41:20.375 --> 41:21.208
Fuck!

41:24.833 --> 41:25.958
Shit, shit.

41:45.708 --> 41:47.625
I'm sorry, sir,
I couldn't hear you.

41:47.708 --> 41:49.375
Are you still on the phone?

41:50.416 --> 41:51.916
Fuck! Shit, man!

41:56.125 --> 41:56.958
Where's Vincent?

41:57.541 --> 41:58.875
-Huh?
-Where's Vincent?

42:15.083 --> 42:16.958
Vincent. Wait.

42:22.375 --> 42:23.250
Hey.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.208
The door.

42:27.916 --> 42:29.125
Let's go.

42:30.958 --> 42:33.416
Roman, come on. We have to get away.

42:36.583 --> 42:37.500
Move!

42:38.458 --> 42:39.375
Roman, come on.

42:43.958 --> 42:45.958
Leave him. Leave him.

43:00.541 --> 43:02.000
I can't see her anymore.

43:02.083 --> 43:03.000
Oh, fuck!

43:08.791 --> 43:09.625
Be careful.

43:12.583 --> 43:14.666
Shit. I can't see her.

43:22.291 --> 43:23.333
Yeah.

43:33.916 --> 43:34.875
Roman, come on.

43:36.166 --> 43:37.625
We have to get out of here.

43:38.416 --> 43:39.250
Roman.

43:42.916 --> 43:43.791
Roman!

43:44.500 --> 43:45.958
We have to get the fuck out of here.

43:56.416 --> 43:57.583
Go!

44:32.000 --> 44:33.750
Maybe you injured her, Roman.

44:33.833 --> 44:36.333
You're lucky
she didn't just pop you too.

44:47.125 --> 44:47.958
The road.

44:50.000 --> 44:50.833
Let's go!

44:53.791 --> 44:55.208
Shit, shit!

44:58.250 --> 44:59.458
Do you need a break?

45:00.833 --> 45:02.250
No break, dude.

45:02.333 --> 45:03.416
Move!

45:08.416 --> 45:09.458
Fuck!

45:13.916 --> 45:15.291
The cabin was over there.

45:25.791 --> 45:27.583
Come on. Come on.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.958
Hey. Shit!

46:17.291 --> 46:18.625
She hasn't seen us.

46:19.416 --> 46:20.333
Walk.

46:26.416 --> 46:27.291
Go on.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.333
Go.

46:47.750 --> 46:49.666
Come on, what do you want from us?

46:49.750 --> 46:53.000
-Don't provoke her!
-Maybe she just wants our money.

46:53.583 --> 46:56.250
-I have money.
-I don't think she wants that.

46:56.333 --> 46:57.791
All right. Run!

46:59.583 --> 47:00.416
Fuck!

47:04.583 --> 47:06.375
Why are you doing this, uh?

47:21.833 --> 47:23.875
Why doesn't she just shoot us dead?

47:24.833 --> 47:26.291
None of this makes any sense.

47:28.166 --> 47:29.958
Who says it has to make sense?

47:37.166 --> 47:38.625
Go. Let's go.

49:47.541 --> 49:48.375
Fuck.

49:49.541 --> 49:50.375
Oh, shit.

49:56.416 --> 49:57.458
Fuck.

50:40.375 --> 50:41.625
What is this place?

51:55.750 --> 51:56.791
Any reception?

51:57.666 --> 51:58.750
No.

52:05.791 --> 52:06.625
Shit.

52:22.125 --> 52:24.125
Albert, don't.

52:26.541 --> 52:28.375
We have to keep moving.

52:29.750 --> 52:31.000
Right now.

52:31.083 --> 52:32.000
Come on!

52:35.291 --> 52:37.916
Stop bossing us around. It's annoying.

52:39.708 --> 52:40.541
Okay.

52:44.125 --> 52:45.000
Alright, Roman.

52:46.833 --> 52:48.208
You decide, then.

52:48.291 --> 52:51.625
What if she suddenly comes out
and it's too late to make a run for it?

52:53.625 --> 52:54.666
Then what?

52:55.750 --> 52:57.000
Any ideas, boss?

53:08.958 --> 53:10.750
Let's hide your brother
in one of the buildings

53:10.833 --> 53:12.958
and come back to get him with the police.

53:13.041 --> 53:13.875
All right?

53:14.458 --> 53:15.458
Hey.

53:16.666 --> 53:18.208
Stop with this bullshit.

53:19.291 --> 53:23.291
-You think I don't get what's going on?
-Albert, go sit down.

53:23.375 --> 53:25.000
-You can barely stand.
-So what?

53:26.041 --> 53:27.750
What next? Huh?

53:29.791 --> 53:31.875
Albert, can you keep running?

53:31.958 --> 53:32.875
Hmm?

53:33.458 --> 53:35.583
Or can you even help one of us
if we get hurt?

53:37.125 --> 53:38.375
No, you can't.

53:38.458 --> 53:39.666
You know I'm not wrong.

53:40.583 --> 53:42.750
So, at least stop lying to yourself!

53:44.458 --> 53:45.708
Albert, leave it!

53:45.791 --> 53:47.541
Okay?

53:47.625 --> 53:49.708
You're such a goddamn moron,
you know that?

53:49.791 --> 53:52.666
Yeah, sure.
That's why we work together, right?

53:53.250 --> 53:56.750
You started a company with me because
you needed a moron to get your funding!

53:56.833 --> 53:59.916
The company wouldn't exist
without me, and neither would you!

54:00.000 --> 54:01.625
Enough, guys, fuck your company!

54:06.125 --> 54:09.916
Come on, give me your phone.
I'll look for a signal and get help.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.000
Albert…

54:14.250 --> 54:15.375
Forget it.

54:19.333 --> 54:20.625
For Christ's sake!

54:24.958 --> 54:26.875
Fuck you, man!

54:30.833 --> 54:31.833
Fucking asshole.

54:32.375 --> 54:33.416
Prince Albert!

54:34.875 --> 54:36.750
You self-centered, stupid asshole!

54:37.583 --> 54:39.375
You always just take whatever you can get.

54:39.458 --> 54:42.708
When someone calls you out on it,
you pretend it has nothing to do with you.

54:43.666 --> 54:44.833
Well I can do that too.

54:46.333 --> 54:48.041
Roman, good luck.

54:48.125 --> 54:49.750
Best of luck, really.

54:49.833 --> 54:52.666
Don't think that this asshole
will ever give you a job!

54:52.750 --> 54:54.625
-Oh, and ask him about Lisa.
-What?

54:55.833 --> 54:57.708
-Wait.
-Don't. Roman.

54:57.791 --> 54:59.625
-Hey!
-Leave him. Leave him, man.

55:00.250 --> 55:01.083
Leave him.

55:03.666 --> 55:05.166
Let him go. He'll calm down.

55:06.041 --> 55:06.916
It's all right.

55:08.333 --> 55:09.250
It's all right.

55:15.291 --> 55:17.125
You think you and I stand a better chance?

55:17.208 --> 55:19.416
Yeah, without an asshole,
we stand a better chance.

55:19.500 --> 55:22.000
Without an asshole?
He's the asshole, yeah?

55:23.166 --> 55:25.416
And he's not right about anything? Huh?

55:26.541 --> 55:29.208
And your injury
is no problem at all, right?

55:30.500 --> 55:33.583
-Now, what's this about Lisa?
-Roman, Roman. Shut up, man.

55:33.666 --> 55:35.083
There's nothing going on.

55:35.916 --> 55:38.458
Listen, don't fall
for his mind games like that.

55:38.541 --> 55:41.333
He just wants to pit us
against each other, it's obvious.

55:43.250 --> 55:44.583
Hey. Hey.

55:46.541 --> 55:47.875
You said it yourself.

55:47.958 --> 55:49.625
We have to stick together.

55:51.041 --> 55:53.208
You and me. We'll stick together.

55:53.291 --> 55:54.833
Huh? We're family.

55:54.916 --> 55:57.250
Roman, we're family.

55:58.583 --> 55:59.416
All right?

56:00.916 --> 56:01.750
Seriously?

56:04.833 --> 56:06.458
Roman. Hey!

56:07.333 --> 56:08.166
Roman!

56:18.541 --> 56:19.916
Safe trip.

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
A NEW FUTURE FOR FALCONRY

59:29.416 --> 59:30.750
Now that's broken.

59:30.833 --> 59:33.625
Like that's the reason
you shoot like shit!

59:33.708 --> 59:36.000
Give me the rife. I know how to aim.

59:36.083 --> 59:38.583
With my rifle.

59:47.791 --> 59:48.791
Look.

59:50.500 --> 59:51.375
Who's that?

59:55.958 --> 59:58.041
Hey! And who are you?

1:00:02.250 --> 1:00:04.291
-Mommy, who is that?
-Hey!

1:00:04.375 --> 1:00:06.166
That's enough now. Just go!

1:00:06.250 --> 1:00:07.500
-Put the rifle away.
-Hey!

1:00:15.958 --> 1:00:18.375
Shit!
Forget the fucking camera! Come on!

1:00:18.458 --> 1:00:21.416
Forget the fucking camera, let's go now!

1:01:36.666 --> 1:01:39.458
Fuck you, guys.

1:01:58.750 --> 1:01:59.583
Hello?

1:02:04.916 --> 1:02:05.958
Hello?

1:02:09.750 --> 1:02:10.666
Did you hear that?

1:02:12.708 --> 1:02:13.541
Shit!

1:02:14.458 --> 1:02:16.791
Hey! Dude, this is insane!

1:02:17.291 --> 1:02:18.125
Roman!

1:02:22.458 --> 1:02:24.625
It's no big deal. Just walk.

1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:26.875
Go on.

1:02:26.958 --> 1:02:29.333
Just keep walking. Go on.

1:02:48.541 --> 1:02:49.375
Hey.

1:02:50.166 --> 1:02:52.541
I haven't done anything to you. Right?

1:02:53.333 --> 1:02:54.250
Please.

1:02:54.333 --> 1:02:55.166
Don't do this.

1:02:58.458 --> 1:02:59.291
Please, don't.

1:03:00.208 --> 1:03:01.250
Please.

1:03:08.916 --> 1:03:11.541
Please don't. Please.

1:03:12.083 --> 1:03:15.583
Please, please. I never did…

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:17.291
I never did anything to you…

1:03:17.375 --> 1:03:18.541
Please!

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.125
What do you want?

1:03:41.916 --> 1:03:42.750
Money?

1:03:44.291 --> 1:03:45.291
I have money.

1:03:46.375 --> 1:03:47.375
A lot, okay?

1:03:59.916 --> 1:04:02.333
-Don't do this.
-I have to help Peter.

1:04:02.416 --> 1:04:04.166
Shush! Shush!

1:04:04.250 --> 1:04:05.958
Roman! Roman!

1:04:06.041 --> 1:04:08.916
I… I'm sure we can come to an agreement.

1:04:24.041 --> 1:04:26.041
Let's go now.

1:04:26.125 --> 1:04:27.666
Roman. We gotta go.

1:04:27.750 --> 1:04:28.583
Now.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:25.250
I can't go on, Roman.

1:05:29.375 --> 1:05:30.833
Here, here.

1:06:03.875 --> 1:06:04.708
Albert?

1:06:04.791 --> 1:06:06.041
Albert, wake up.

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:09.416
Just resting a bit.

1:06:10.333 --> 1:06:11.583
For a moment.

1:06:12.416 --> 1:06:13.250
Okay.

1:06:17.666 --> 1:06:18.500
Okay.

1:06:26.875 --> 1:06:27.833
Fuck.

1:07:07.791 --> 1:07:08.875
Oh, fuck!

1:07:47.250 --> 1:07:50.541
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU, ALBERT!
SAY HI TO YOUR BROTHER…

1:08:37.166 --> 1:08:38.166
Hey.

1:08:38.791 --> 1:08:39.625
Hi.

1:08:40.291 --> 1:08:42.791
Well? I told you I'd drop by.

1:08:43.375 --> 1:08:45.375
Yeah, it's really good to see you.

1:08:47.666 --> 1:08:49.250
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey.

1:08:51.958 --> 1:08:54.875
-Are you sure it's no trouble?
-Nah, it's not.

1:08:54.958 --> 1:08:56.875
-Cool. Come on in.
-Okay.

1:09:17.333 --> 1:09:18.708
You can tell him to leave.

1:09:20.375 --> 1:09:21.375
Yes, I can.

1:09:21.958 --> 1:09:23.291
Seems like you can't.

1:09:34.791 --> 1:09:37.916
-I'll get more of this stuff.
-Oh, thank you.

1:09:42.833 --> 1:09:44.250
-See you in a bit.
-See you.

1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:46.333
Hey.

1:09:47.875 --> 1:09:50.166
-Are you gonna get groceries?
-Yeah.

1:09:50.250 --> 1:09:52.666
-Can you pick up a bottle of gin?
-Yeah, you bet.

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:56.083
-Dinner in the village tonight?
-If you carry me, yeah.

1:09:58.083 --> 1:09:58.916
Gladly.

1:10:01.625 --> 1:10:02.625
Yeah, yeah.

1:10:23.208 --> 1:10:24.375
Is it still painful?

1:10:26.416 --> 1:10:27.250
Mm-hmm.

1:11:02.083 --> 1:11:04.041
-What's wrong?
-Stay quiet.

1:11:06.541 --> 1:11:07.375
Okay.

1:11:13.458 --> 1:11:15.208
-What's with you?
-Shut your mouth.

1:11:20.333 --> 1:11:21.333
Okay.

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.375
It just happened, you know?

1:11:35.666 --> 1:11:36.500
Yeah.

1:11:38.250 --> 1:11:40.083
-Of course.
-It's the truth.

1:11:41.041 --> 1:11:43.208
-It was an accident. Do you understand?
-No.

1:11:44.041 --> 1:11:45.500
I don't understand.

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:52.666
What do you want? An apology?

1:12:01.125 --> 1:12:02.125
Please don't.

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.625
You'd have to be sorry for that.

1:12:07.333 --> 1:12:09.500
So leave me here. Hurry up. Go on.

1:14:49.166 --> 1:14:51.416
-What are you doing?
-Shut up, asshole.

1:14:57.583 --> 1:14:58.958
Here, put pressure on it.

1:18:53.166 --> 1:18:54.250
I know about Anne.

1:18:57.250 --> 1:18:58.708
I've seen it all of it.

1:19:04.875 --> 1:19:06.000
I'm sorry.
