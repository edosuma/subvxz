00:00.349 --> 00:01.974
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.565 --> 00:04.265
Want to grab some lunch?

00:04.267 --> 00:06.367
You know what? I don't think so.

00:06.369 --> 00:08.369
Oh, let me guess,
you're not eating

00:08.371 --> 00:12.140
because the mean girls circled
your chubby bits in marker?

00:12.142 --> 00:14.575
No. That, that right there.

00:14.577 --> 00:16.711
That's the reason.
You're always making fun of me.

00:16.713 --> 00:18.479
Those are just jokes.

00:18.481 --> 00:21.382
It's my way of saying
that we're friends,

00:21.384 --> 00:25.253
and it wouldn't hurt you
to drop a few.

00:25.255 --> 00:28.022
15 years of constant ridicule.

00:28.024 --> 00:30.992
I-I think our relationship
has become toxic.

00:30.994 --> 00:33.027
What are you saying?

00:33.029 --> 00:37.198
I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.

00:39.536 --> 00:41.002
Look, I...

00:41.004 --> 00:43.204
I can see you're
upset, but...

00:43.206 --> 00:46.507
I'm gonna need
some ground rules.

00:46.509 --> 00:50.111
While we're apart, can I see
other needy Indian men?

00:50.113 --> 00:51.346
Get out!

00:54.150 --> 00:56.851
Oh, Stuart,
two questions:

00:56.853 --> 00:58.920
Do you have the new Aquaman,

00:58.922 --> 01:03.891
and do you mind if I use your
back room to smoke some meat?

01:03.893 --> 01:06.561
Well, since it's you asking,

01:06.563 --> 01:10.031
I'm gonna guess
that's not a euphemism.

01:10.867 --> 01:12.333
Why are you smoking meat?

01:12.335 --> 01:15.169
And why are you
reading Aquaman?

01:15.171 --> 01:18.906
I am trying to make Amy
a historically accurate

01:18.908 --> 01:22.343
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
dinner for her birthday, and...

01:22.345 --> 01:25.813
I want to be able to say I was
reading it before it was cool.

01:25.815 --> 01:28.282
Wow, well, that's
actually really sweet.

01:28.284 --> 01:30.918
The dinner thing.
The Aquaman thing's dumb.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.320
Eh...

01:32.322 --> 01:35.189
Isn't Halley's birthday
the same as Amy's?

01:35.191 --> 01:37.525
Yeah, but we're not doing
anything big 'cause she's one,

01:37.527 --> 01:41.829
Bernadette's on bed rest,
and I'm lazy.

01:41.831 --> 01:43.731
Hey, guys.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.933
Hello.
Hey.

01:45.935 --> 01:47.301
Howard.

01:47.303 --> 01:48.770
Raj.

01:48.772 --> 01:51.072
Excuse me.

01:51.074 --> 01:53.441
Really? Is this
still happening?

01:53.443 --> 01:56.644
I'm willing to make up,
but someone's being a baby.

01:56.646 --> 01:59.280
Ooh! I do love a riddle.
Oh, let me see.

02:00.517 --> 02:02.016
See, my first guess
would be Halley,

02:02.018 --> 02:04.285
but that'd be strange to
accuse her of being a baby

02:04.287 --> 02:05.853
'cause she is a baby. Um...

02:05.855 --> 02:07.255
I suppose it could be Stuart;

02:07.257 --> 02:10.425
his head does have
a certain milky scent.

02:12.562 --> 02:14.662
Although...

02:14.664 --> 02:18.065
I-It's me, Sheldon.
He-He's calling me a baby.

02:18.067 --> 02:21.602
No, I don't know. I saw Leonard
put his keys in his mouth today.

02:21.604 --> 02:24.739
u're a grown man;Sheldon.
act like it.alling me a baby.

02:24.741 --> 02:28.543
Big talk coming from a guy
holding an Archie comic book.

02:28.545 --> 02:31.746
Hey, werewolf Jughead
is not your dad's Jughead.

02:31.748 --> 02:35.082
Come on, you guys have been
friends forever. Quit fighting.

02:35.084 --> 02:36.117
I have an extra ticket

02:36.119 --> 02:37.919
to the opening of
<i>The Last Jedi</i> tonight.

02:37.921 --> 02:40.288
It was gonna be Howard's,
but you can have it.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.423

03:11.228 --> 03:13.128
- Mm, I'm in.
- Me, too.

03:13.130 --> 03:16.031
It'll be nice to see the parts
I missed while I was blinking.

03:16.934 --> 03:18.734
Hey, guys,
there's a change of plans.

03:18.736 --> 03:21.236
We are having a party
for Halley's birthday after all.

03:21.238 --> 03:25.440
Turns out Bernadette and "anyone
who's not a heartless monster"

03:25.442 --> 03:27.643
thinks that's
the right thing to do.

03:27.645 --> 03:30.779
I don't like kids,
but I do like birthday cake.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.482
Oh, wait, will there be
sugary icing flowers on it?

03:33.484 --> 03:34.650
I don't know.

03:34.652 --> 03:37.019
I'll risk it.

03:37.021 --> 03:40.355
But if I have a tantrum and have
to leave early, you'll know why.

03:41.992 --> 03:44.526
Here you go. Here you go.

03:45.296 --> 03:47.563
See you two there.

03:47.565 --> 03:49.164
Are you kidding me?

03:49.166 --> 03:50.933
You're not gonna invite me
to Halley's birthday?

03:50.935 --> 03:53.602
I'm her godfather;
that means something.

03:53.604 --> 03:56.939
Or-- hear me out on this--
it doesn't.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.041
Okay, that's enough.

03:59.043 --> 04:02.778
This fight either has to end
or get way more entertaining.

04:02.780 --> 04:06.682
Don't worry about it 'cause
I'm done putting up with him!

04:11.789 --> 04:14.256
I know you have a lot
on your mind,

04:14.258 --> 04:17.392
but when do you think we'll have
an answer on those cake flowers?

04:19.762 --> 04:21.096
Hey.

04:21.098 --> 04:22.664
Hey. What you reading?

04:22.666 --> 04:24.099
Oh, it's your brother's
Christmas letter.

04:24.101 --> 04:25.334
Ugh.

04:25.336 --> 04:28.003
If there's a picture
of his wife and his kids

04:28.005 --> 04:30.939
and his dogs and his horses
all in matching pajamas,

04:30.941 --> 04:33.141
I beg you to burn it.

04:33.143 --> 04:36.011
Aw, the people's pajamas
have little horses on them,

04:36.013 --> 04:39.047
and the horses'
have little people.

04:39.049 --> 04:42.117
It's just his chance to brag
about how great his life is.

04:42.119 --> 04:43.185
Oh, come on, it's nice.

04:43.187 --> 04:44.720
You know that nonprofit
he works with?

04:44.722 --> 04:46.989
They built a hospital
in Rwanda.

04:46.991 --> 04:50.425
Look at me.
I built a hospital in Rwanda.

04:50.427 --> 04:53.662
That is a good point.
I hadn't thought of it that way.

04:53.664 --> 04:56.265
- Hello.
- Hey.

04:56.267 --> 04:59.334
So this is for Amy's birthday.
Can I leave it here?

04:59.336 --> 05:00.569
Sure. What is it?

05:00.571 --> 05:02.371
A butter churn.

05:02.373 --> 05:04.506
Aw, that's what I got her.

05:04.508 --> 05:09.144
It's for her surprise
frontier birthday dinner.

05:09.146 --> 05:10.545
I am making

05:10.547 --> 05:13.215
hardtack, boiled salt pork,

05:13.217 --> 05:17.619
and because it's a special day,
a chewable gob of tree sap.

05:17.621 --> 05:20.122
Is that good?

05:20.124 --> 05:22.224
Uh, compared to other foods, no.

05:22.226 --> 05:25.894
Compared to other parts
of a tree? Eh.

05:26.997 --> 05:30.666
And then after dinner,
we will have birthday coitus.

05:30.668 --> 05:34.503
Do you think that will also
be historically accurate?

05:34.505 --> 05:36.938
I assume like
the rest of frontier life,

05:36.940 --> 05:39.107
it'll be exhausting and short.

05:40.144 --> 05:41.710
You're exhausting and short.

05:46.984 --> 05:51.720
Hey, Stuart, you're coming
to Halley's party, right?

05:51.722 --> 05:52.688
You bet.

05:52.690 --> 05:55.090
Plus, I live there
and I was invited,

05:55.092 --> 05:57.859
so it's already better
than my tenth birthday party.

05:57.861 --> 06:00.662
Great. Can you
bring a few things?

06:00.664 --> 06:01.596
Sure. What do you need?

06:01.598 --> 06:02.964
Balloons, streamers,

06:02.966 --> 06:04.433
ice, snacks, a bounce house,
face painter,

06:04.435 --> 06:07.002
and a couple kids whose parents
are willing to lie and say

06:07.004 --> 06:09.971
they know me from the Daddy
and Me class I've never been to.

06:09.973 --> 06:12.374
Where do you and Halley
go every week?

06:12.376 --> 06:14.476
The important thing
is we're together,

06:14.478 --> 06:18.347
and if the movie gets
too violent, I cover her eyes.

06:18.349 --> 06:21.383
Don't stress about this party.

06:21.385 --> 06:22.684
She's one; she's not
gonna remember.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.620
The other day I showed her
her toe, and she was shocked.

06:27.791 --> 06:29.925
It's not for the baby;
it's for Bernadette.

06:29.927 --> 06:31.159
She's feeling guilty

06:31.161 --> 06:33.762
about all the stuff she's
missing with Halley.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.097
All right.

06:35.099 --> 06:37.032
Uncle Stuart's got your back.

06:37.034 --> 06:39.234
Ain't no party
like a Stuart party

06:39.236 --> 06:42.971
because Stuart's never
invited to parties.

06:47.277 --> 06:50.178
Did the electricity go out?

06:50.180 --> 06:52.414
I don't know what you mean
by "electricity," ma'am.

06:52.416 --> 06:56.885
I am just a farmer boy living in
a little house on the prairie.

07:01.325 --> 07:03.592
I'm glad you're happy.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.994
I wanted to do something special
for your birthday.

07:05.996 --> 07:10.198
Oh, you did, you did!
It's perfect!

07:10.200 --> 07:11.867
You do know that my birthday's
tomorrow, right?

07:11.869 --> 07:15.337
This is just step one
of your birthday weekend.

07:15.339 --> 07:19.508
Now, would you care to join me
for an authentic frontier dinner

07:19.510 --> 07:21.309
made entirely from scratch?

07:21.311 --> 07:24.146
I can't believe you
did this. It's amazing!

07:24.148 --> 07:26.047
Oh, it's not a big deal.

07:26.049 --> 07:28.950
Just to be clear,
it was a big deal.

07:29.987 --> 07:32.554
I was being modest.
You got that, right?

07:32.556 --> 07:33.822
Loud and clear.

07:33.824 --> 07:35.023
Well, I hope
you're hungry.

07:35.025 --> 07:36.224
Oh, I'm starving.

07:36.226 --> 07:39.428
Oh, good. Starvation is
authentic to the time period.

07:41.098 --> 07:42.831
If you also have malaria

07:42.833 --> 07:44.666
and a deep distrust
of Native Americans,

07:44.668 --> 07:46.334
we're really cooking
with a woodstove.

07:47.638 --> 07:48.937
Is that butter?

07:48.939 --> 07:50.005
Yes.

07:50.007 --> 07:51.573
But don't blow it all
on one biscuit.

07:51.575 --> 07:53.141
Took me nine hours to make that.

07:54.311 --> 07:56.711
I think I got churner's elbow.

07:56.713 --> 07:59.481
I know we only have coitus
on my birthday,

07:59.483 --> 08:02.184
but I don't know if I can wait
until midnight.

08:02.186 --> 08:05.187
Oh, well, you'll be
glad you did.

08:05.189 --> 08:06.888
Everyone knows the best foreplay

08:06.890 --> 08:09.524
is rigid adherence
to a strict schedule.

08:13.497 --> 08:15.397
Hey. What are you doing?

08:15.399 --> 08:17.732
Oh, I've decided to write
my own Christmas letter.

08:17.734 --> 08:19.000
So I'm gonna make a list

08:19.002 --> 08:20.936
of all the cool things
we did this year.

08:20.938 --> 08:22.971
Oh, fun. Can I help?

08:22.973 --> 08:26.975
Yes. Can you think of a single
cool thing we did this year?

08:26.977 --> 08:30.545
Uh, well, both of our jobs
are going great.

08:30.547 --> 08:34.115
Sure. I mean, my Air Force
project got taken away,

08:34.116 --> 08:37.619
and you're not crazy about
selling pharmaceuticals.

08:37.621 --> 08:41.690
I'll just write down
"still employed."

08:41.692 --> 08:44.326
Oh, we had our
second anniversary.

08:44.328 --> 08:45.594
Uh, yeah,

08:45.596 --> 08:47.529
but we did kind of
forget about it,

08:47.531 --> 08:50.565
so maybe just write
"still married."

08:51.768 --> 08:54.903
Great. Okay.

08:54.905 --> 08:55.971
Okay, that's a start.

08:55.973 --> 08:58.874
What else?

09:01.311 --> 09:05.447
You know, maybe this is enough.

09:07.351 --> 09:10.252
Let's look at our pictures;
that-that'll jog our memories.

09:11.788 --> 09:13.421
What is that
a picture of?

09:13.423 --> 09:16.024
Oh, uh, that's
a mole on my back.

09:17.794 --> 09:20.195
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't growing.

09:20.197 --> 09:22.797
How'd you get a picture
of your own back?

09:22.799 --> 09:26.101
Sheldon took it.
We're kind of mole buddies.

09:27.804 --> 09:29.170
Hey, that's
a cute picture.

09:29.172 --> 09:31.306
Isn't that the day
we almost went to the beach?

09:31.308 --> 09:32.507
Memorial Day?

09:32.509 --> 09:34.709
No, that was the day we almost
went to the mountains.

09:34.711 --> 09:35.944
Oh.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.045
That's the great thing
about California;

09:37.047 --> 09:38.380
you can almost go
to the mountains

09:38.382 --> 09:40.448
and almost go to the
beach in the same day.

09:40.450 --> 09:41.917
Yeah.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.592
Look, I'm sorry about
not inviting you

09:50.594 --> 09:52.727
to Halley's birthday.
That wasn't cool.

09:52.729 --> 09:55.096
And of course we would
love to have you. Here.

09:55.098 --> 09:57.632
Thank you.

09:57.634 --> 09:59.200
I'd really like to be there.

09:59.202 --> 10:02.837
Great, 'cause it's tomorrow,
and I need you to plan it.

10:04.675 --> 10:05.874
What?

10:05.876 --> 10:07.208
Stuart was gonna help,

10:07.210 --> 10:09.844
but the free clinic had
an open spot for a colonoscopy,

10:09.846 --> 10:11.780
and he jumped on it.

10:11.782 --> 10:16.217
So-so-so you're just apologizing
because you need something?

10:16.219 --> 10:20.121
Yes, and I think it's pretty
mature of me to admit it.

10:20.123 --> 10:22.357
Well, that's very insulting.

10:22.359 --> 10:25.160
Right again.
Are you gonna help me or not?

10:25.162 --> 10:27.228
No, I will not help you.

10:29.066 --> 10:32.000
But I will help Halley.

10:32.002 --> 10:34.669
She's my goddaughter,
and I love her.

10:34.671 --> 10:36.538
And I have a lot of party favors

10:36.540 --> 10:40.475
left over from
Cinnamon's birthday, so...

10:40.477 --> 10:43.645
I hope she likes things that
squeak when you chew on them.

10:43.647 --> 10:46.848
Sh-She's a human being,
not an animal.

10:46.850 --> 10:49.784
But that actually
would be a hit.

10:52.155 --> 10:54.155
Can I get you
anything else?

10:54.157 --> 10:56.024
No, thanks.

10:56.026 --> 10:57.659
I think I'm good.

10:57.661 --> 11:00.228
You sure? There's
still plenty of pork fat.

11:00.230 --> 11:01.930
Although, if we don't eat it,

11:01.932 --> 11:04.799
I suppose we could
turn it into soap.

11:04.801 --> 11:07.302
That might taste better.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.841
I think I'm just gonna go over
here and sit on the couch.

11:12.843 --> 11:13.975
Oh, great.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.478
Then we will move on
to stage two:

11:16.480 --> 11:18.847
the pitching of woo.

11:19.683 --> 11:21.549
Ooh.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.722
Should I read you some bawdy
19th century limericks?

11:27.724 --> 11:29.858
Okay.

11:29.860 --> 11:30.925
Oh, here.

11:30.927 --> 11:33.361
"There once was a priest
from Terre Haute

11:33.363 --> 11:37.198
who purchased a
sheep and a goat..."

11:37.200 --> 11:39.267
Hold on a second.

11:39.269 --> 11:41.069
Is it getting hot in here?

11:41.071 --> 11:44.072
Well, I didn't even get
to the dirty part yet.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.541
No, I-I'm serious.

11:46.543 --> 11:49.310
Do you think there was
something wrong with that food?

11:49.312 --> 11:53.114
Frontier scallops?
I shouldn't think so.

11:53.116 --> 11:55.884
My stomach's feeling
a little weird.

11:55.886 --> 11:58.219
Yeah. Uh, mine, too.

11:58.221 --> 12:02.123
I'm sure it's just the first
sharp cramps of arousal.

12:09.099 --> 12:11.566
No. Th-This doesn't feel right.

12:11.568 --> 12:14.769
Hey, hey, save that sexy talk
for the bedroom.

12:16.006 --> 12:18.373
You know, if you'll excuse me,

12:18.375 --> 12:21.976
I am just going
to go freshen up.

12:26.483 --> 12:27.916
Sheldon?

12:27.918 --> 12:29.117
I'll be out in a minute.

12:29.119 --> 12:31.286
I don't have a minute!

12:36.661 --> 12:39.996
I can't believe you pulled
this all together overnight.

12:39.998 --> 12:43.065
Uh, if I had more time, I could
have gotten the Blue Man Group.

12:43.835 --> 12:45.768
One of them goes
to my dry cleaner.

12:45.770 --> 12:47.570
Who, by the way, hates him.

12:47.572 --> 12:50.740
You really saved the day.

12:50.742 --> 12:52.642
Well, it's not for you.
It's for Halley.

12:52.644 --> 12:54.176
And I'm sure

12:54.178 --> 12:58.314
she'd appreciate it, if she knew
what's going on or who you are.

13:05.857 --> 13:07.390
Morning.

13:07.392 --> 13:09.125
Happy birthday.

13:09.127 --> 13:11.627
Yeah, sure.

13:13.431 --> 13:15.765
Did you sleep at all?

13:15.767 --> 13:18.901
No. You?

13:18.903 --> 13:21.671
I passed out on the toilet once.

13:21.673 --> 13:24.573
I don't know if that counts.

13:24.575 --> 13:26.275
Feel any better?

13:26.277 --> 13:28.477
I feel terrible.

13:30.181 --> 13:32.682
Well...

13:32.684 --> 13:35.751
should we make love now?

13:35.753 --> 13:39.221
How can you even think
about sex?

13:39.223 --> 13:42.725
Hey, I'm a man; I have
annual needs just like anyone.

13:42.727 --> 13:45.027
And besides,

13:45.029 --> 13:47.396
it's our birthday tradition.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.167
You think you can do it

13:51.169 --> 13:54.370
while I lie perfectly still
and you don't touch me?

13:56.174 --> 13:58.374
I can try.

14:04.248 --> 14:06.649
Want to do it again?

14:08.853 --> 14:10.319
Morning.

14:10.321 --> 14:12.488
Morning.

14:12.490 --> 14:15.057
"Kept Fern alive"?
Who's Fern?

14:16.928 --> 14:19.829
No, <i>the</i> fern.
The one in the bathroom.

14:19.831 --> 14:23.466
We're really calling
that brown thing alive? Okay.

14:23.468 --> 14:26.635
So, how long have you
been working on this?

14:26.637 --> 14:28.237
Oh, couple hours.

14:28.239 --> 14:31.807
I took a break to try to beat
my high score on <i>Mario Kart.</i>

14:31.809 --> 14:33.275
Well, did you do it?

14:33.277 --> 14:35.878
Do you see it on the board?

14:35.880 --> 14:37.380
Okay, this is silly.

14:37.382 --> 14:39.081
Our lives are great.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.316
I think so, too.

14:40.318 --> 14:42.418
So then why is this
bugging you so much?

14:42.420 --> 14:45.988
I guess it feels like
everyone's moving forward

14:45.990 --> 14:47.356
and we're stuck.

14:47.358 --> 14:48.824
What do you mean?

14:48.826 --> 14:50.960
Well, we've been
married two years.

14:50.962 --> 14:52.561
Should we think
about what's next?

14:52.563 --> 14:55.331
Like buying a house
or having a baby?

14:55.333 --> 14:57.033
Look, I want to do
all those things someday,

14:57.035 --> 14:59.201
but there's a bunch of stuff
I want to do first.

14:59.203 --> 15:00.336
Okay, like what?

15:00.338 --> 15:03.939
I don't know,
stay thin and have money.

15:03.941 --> 15:06.042
No, no, I-I'm serious.

15:06.044 --> 15:08.644
If there's things we want to do,
let's start doing them.

15:08.646 --> 15:12.048
Okay. Well, we've never been
on a big trip together.

15:12.050 --> 15:13.783
I would love that.

15:13.785 --> 15:14.984
Okay, there's something
for your letter:

15:14.986 --> 15:17.753
"Considered going on a trip."

15:18.623 --> 15:20.322
It's just a day trip,

15:20.324 --> 15:23.159
but we could take the
ferry out to Catalina.

15:23.161 --> 15:24.827
Great, let's do it.

15:24.829 --> 15:27.730
Amy's in the bathroom
and I need to...!

15:33.404 --> 15:35.938
It's like I can hear
the ocean already.

15:38.509 --> 15:41.477
Okay. Thanks for
letting me know.

15:41.479 --> 15:43.112
Hey, what's going on?

15:43.114 --> 15:45.948
Bernadette's sister's kids
are sick and they're not coming.

15:45.950 --> 15:49.819
But they're the whole reason
the cupcakes are vegan!

15:50.855 --> 15:53.255
How's the party coming?
Good!

15:53.257 --> 15:56.025
Great! Our friends
should be here any second!

15:56.027 --> 15:59.195
Those are the only
other people you invited?

15:59.197 --> 16:01.831
What about the kids
from the Daddy and Me class?

16:01.833 --> 16:03.132
Oh, grow up.

16:06.471 --> 16:07.903
Uh-oh.

16:07.905 --> 16:09.205
What?

16:09.207 --> 16:11.307
I left the food out.

16:11.309 --> 16:14.143
You afraid it's gonna go good?

16:17.348 --> 16:19.615
How are you feeling?

16:19.617 --> 16:23.652
Ugh. My stomach aches,
I got the chills,

16:23.654 --> 16:25.988
my mouth tastes weird,

16:25.990 --> 16:27.456
it hurts to swallow,

16:27.458 --> 16:29.625
and I've got
a little double vision.

16:29.627 --> 16:31.260
Yeah.

16:31.262 --> 16:32.995
I'm feeling better, too.

16:40.938 --> 16:43.272
Well, this party's
a disaster.

16:43.274 --> 16:44.306
Don't blame the party!

16:44.308 --> 16:46.575
You know how many favors
I had to call in

16:46.577 --> 16:49.678
with my bounce house guy
to get Wonder Woman?

16:50.281 --> 16:52.982
Is that
Wonder Woman?

16:54.318 --> 16:56.085
Technically,
it's a Chinese knockoff called

16:56.087 --> 16:59.054
Happy Strong Swimsuit Lady.

16:59.056 --> 17:01.757
Then I take it back;
it's a <i>great</i> party.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.292
Well, you can sit here
and sulk if you want.

17:04.295 --> 17:06.295
I'm gonna go celebrate
Halley's first birthday.

17:06.297 --> 17:09.131
Which I planned
with no help from you.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.633
What are you doing?

17:10.635 --> 17:13.502
It's a bounce house!
I'm gonna go bounce in it!

17:14.605 --> 17:16.338
You're supposed
to take your shoes off

17:16.339 --> 17:17.873
before you go in there!

17:20.310 --> 17:21.844
You know what?

17:21.846 --> 17:24.980
I'm stressed about
my daughter's birthday party.

17:24.982 --> 17:27.183
I don't need your attitude.

17:27.185 --> 17:28.751
Well, I worked
really hard on this,

17:28.753 --> 17:30.819
and you haven't even
said thank you.

17:30.821 --> 17:31.954
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you.

17:31.956 --> 17:33.155
Thank you for blaming me

17:33.157 --> 17:34.657
for everything
that's wrong in your life!

17:34.659 --> 17:37.426
Thank you for walking out
on our friendship!

17:37.428 --> 17:38.761
You are welcome!

17:38.763 --> 17:41.797
And thank you for mocking me
for all of these years!

17:41.799 --> 17:45.034
Thank you for making it so easy!

17:45.036 --> 17:47.570
Why are you being such a jerk?

17:47.572 --> 17:51.740
Because you're my best friend
and you hurt my feelings!

17:51.742 --> 17:54.543
Well, you're my best friend
and you hurt <i>my</i> feelings!

17:56.681 --> 17:58.847
I can't believe you shoved me!

18:01.319 --> 18:03.052
Well, I can't believe
you shoved <i>me!</i>

18:03.054 --> 18:04.853
But it was kind of fun,
wasn't it?!

18:04.855 --> 18:07.223
It was! Do it again!
Gladly!

18:08.759 --> 18:11.093
Okay, now at the same time!

18:12.830 --> 18:14.129
Oh, oh, that was awesome!

18:14.131 --> 18:17.333
Yeah, okay, this time,
knees, then feet.

18:17.335 --> 18:19.602
One, two, three.

18:20.371 --> 18:23.272
Again! Again!

18:25.775 --> 18:26.808
Hello.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.158
- Hi.
- You made it.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.826
How you two feeling?

18:29.828 --> 18:30.760
Oh, a little better.

18:30.762 --> 18:32.028
Those books should
have been called

18:32.030 --> 18:34.064
<i>Little Outhouse</i>
<i>on the Prairie.</i>

18:35.601 --> 18:37.167
Halley's awake
and ready for her party!

18:37.169 --> 18:38.168
Be right up!

18:38.170 --> 18:39.870
Ooh, I want to see
the birthday girl.

18:39.872 --> 18:41.104
I'd love to see her.

18:41.106 --> 18:43.707
If you also want
to change the birthday girl,

18:43.709 --> 18:45.842
you're in luck!

18:46.912 --> 18:49.646
You know...

18:49.648 --> 18:51.481
it's still your birthday.

18:51.483 --> 18:52.716
It is.

18:52.718 --> 18:54.150
And...

18:54.152 --> 18:57.554
we <i>are</i> both...
feeling better.

18:58.557 --> 19:00.891
We are.

19:00.893 --> 19:02.826
And there's no one
in that bounce house.

19:02.828 --> 19:04.427
No.

19:04.429 --> 19:07.364
Great.

19:07.366 --> 19:08.565
Let's go jump for a bit,

19:08.567 --> 19:10.867
and then find a bedroom
to have coitus in.
