00:44.686 --> 00:47.417
<i>here's a frank guaranteed
to get you moving this morning.</i>

02:14.307 --> 02:15.877
Morning, sunshine. How you doing?

02:16.016 --> 02:18.303
Yeah, I'm all right. How you doing?

02:19.436 --> 02:21.006
All right, Linford?

02:21.146 --> 02:22.989
Ready? whoo!

02:25.775 --> 02:28.096
Chop chop.
I've got to get back for a delivery.

02:28.277 --> 02:29.722
When are you gonna get a new tracksuit?

02:29.862 --> 02:31.466
- This is vintage.
- It's a relic.

02:32.573 --> 02:34.894
- Well, you need new spikes.
- I'm broke.

02:35.533 --> 02:37.217
Well, nail it on the weekend

02:37.368 --> 02:39.575
and you'll have new spikes
coming out of your ears.

02:40.204 --> 02:42.855
Come on, Linford!
Show her how it's done! Go!

02:44.917 --> 02:46.919
All right, then, what's that time
gonna be on Sunday?

02:47.086 --> 02:49.453
- Under 23.
- That's right, because then we...

02:50.130 --> 02:51.780
- We qualify.
- Exactly.

02:51.923 --> 02:54.369
World Champs, here we come.
Go on, then. Get ready.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.617
Okay.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.214
On the one!

03:05.143 --> 03:07.111
Three, two, one!

03:08.312 --> 03:11.395
Pump it! Push into the bend!

03:12.733 --> 03:14.223
Good!

03:15.402 --> 03:16.733
Bring it home, through the line.

03:24.410 --> 03:27.300
- Still half a second off.
- Oh, you want more?

03:27.496 --> 03:29.817
- I got more.
- Well, bloody well do it then.

03:29.997 --> 03:31.647
Stop wasting your breath.

03:31.791 --> 03:33.873
- You're the boss.
- Yes, I bloody well am.

03:35.794 --> 03:38.001
Linford! Get out of there!

03:46.805 --> 03:48.648
Hey! Hey, Shania.

03:48.806 --> 03:51.412
Come here.
Where's that sister of yours, eh?

03:51.601 --> 03:53.729
What? You tell me.
She lives with you, innit.

03:53.894 --> 03:55.384
No, I heard she moved back in with you.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.490
- Well, she didn't, so you heard wrong.
- Is that right?

03:58.690 --> 04:00.374
Yeah, Daze.
Look, I don't have time for this, man.

04:00.525 --> 04:04.689
If Tara knows what's good for her
she will call me. Today, yeah?

04:04.945 --> 04:06.674
- You're gonna tell her that.
- All right.

04:06.822 --> 04:08.506
- Good.
- Bye.

04:11.117 --> 04:14.644
- Hey, make sure you tell her, yeah?
- I'll tell her.

04:30.718 --> 04:32.322
- Oh sh...
- Don't answer.

04:32.469 --> 04:33.994
I swear, if he calls me one more time...

04:34.138 --> 04:35.708
- Tara!
- Don't start, Shania.

04:35.847 --> 04:38.373
I got enough going on.
That man is driving me crazy.

04:38.558 --> 04:40.003
I swear, if he comes
anywhere near me again...

04:40.142 --> 04:41.143
Are you gonna turn that shower off?

04:41.269 --> 04:43.317
Why have you always
got to give me grief?

04:46.607 --> 04:48.735
Hi, baby. Hello, Auntie.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.346
Not You, as well?

04:50.485 --> 04:52.567
Oh, look, please,
just for a couple of days?

04:52.737 --> 04:53.943
No way.

05:00.911 --> 05:02.879
Please, Auntie P.
She can stay on the sofa with me

05:03.038 --> 05:05.279
and I promise that
we won't get in your way.

05:06.624 --> 05:09.230
Fine, fine, fine.

05:10.127 --> 05:11.697
Thanks, Auntie.

05:13.755 --> 05:16.122
Thanks, Tyrell. Actually, yeah,
training was all right today.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.541
Yeah, it weren't too bad, thanks.

05:38.193 --> 05:40.639
- Ah, there she is.
- Good luck today, darling.

05:40.821 --> 05:42.585
Don't waste the Luck, Mum
It's just for practice.

05:42.739 --> 05:43.979
- Oh, right.
- just because you've already

05:44.116 --> 05:46.005
been selected, doesn't mean
you don't need the practice

05:46.159 --> 05:49.481
-or the luck.
- Sorry, Dad. Mum...

05:49.704 --> 05:51.149
- Love you.
- Nice to see you, Ellie.

05:56.752 --> 05:57.992
Hi, Lisa.

05:58.127 --> 05:59.731
Hi.

05:59.879 --> 06:02.564
Jane wanted to come and support today.

06:02.757 --> 06:03.804
Great.

06:04.717 --> 06:05.843
How's your mum?

06:08.429 --> 06:10.636
Uh, sorry, Jane.
It's a family tradition.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.773
We always go quiet before a race.

06:12.933 --> 06:14.298
It's part of the preparation.
Right, darling?

06:27.528 --> 06:29.053
Come on,
we're starting in a few minutes.

06:29.197 --> 06:30.198
Is that Lisa Temple?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.724
Shania, listen. Focus on your own race.

06:32.908 --> 06:35.593
- Okay.
- She already got her slot.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.834
If you run the way I know you can,
the last one's yours.

06:37.996 --> 06:38.963
- All right?
- Yeah.

06:39.081 --> 06:41.288
You have as much right to be here
as they do.

06:41.457 --> 06:42.902
Now you go and show them that. Go on.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.204
- All right. Take that for me. All right.
- Yeah.

06:45.378 --> 06:50.066
<i>Ana' the next race is the
final' qualifier for the gb sprint squad.</i>

06:50.340 --> 06:52.866
<i>With the World Champiohships
at the end of the summer,</i>

06:53.051 --> 06:54.621
<i>only one place remains.</i>

06:54.760 --> 06:58.207
<i>The fastest 200-meter time,

06:58.431 --> 07:00.320
<i>- Good Luck.

07:00.474 --> 07:02.795
<i>6000' fuck to them aft'!</i>

07:09.107 --> 07:10.518
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

07:16.071 --> 07:17.436
On your marks.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.022
Set.

07:36.548 --> 07:38.755
<i>Andrews in lane three,
up with the leaders.</i>

07:38.925 --> 07:41.246
<i>This is a fast opening quarter.</i>

07:41.677 --> 07:44.123
<i>- Round the bend. Chapman in the feed.
- Yes!</i>

07:44.638 --> 07:46.049
<i>Andrews is pressuring.</i>

07:46.931 --> 07:49.662
<i>Twenty metres to go!
And Andrews ta/res the lead!</i>

07:51.936 --> 07:54.382
<i>- Andrews if is!</i>

07:54.563 --> 07:56.804
<i>- Shania Andrews made great time there.</i>

07:58.108 --> 08:00.679
<i>she'll take the final' piece
in the gb squad.</i>

08:00.860 --> 08:02.703
<i>- Congratulations, shaina...
- Yes!</i>

08:02.862 --> 08:04.910
<i>On a great race.</i>

08:05.072 --> 08:06.915
<i>joining local hero Lisa Temple...
-whoo!</i>

08:07.074 --> 08:08.724
<i>...- at the World Championships.
- -  who's that?</i>

08:08.867 --> 08:11.632
Shania Andrews. Local girl.

08:11.829 --> 08:14.196
And has she broken 23 before?

08:14.372 --> 08:16.340
She's been building steadily all year.

08:16.499 --> 08:19.582
Well, considering she missed
last year altogether, I'm impressed.

08:20.377 --> 08:21.583
It looks like Lisa's got a rival.

08:23.839 --> 08:25.125
That will be good for her.

08:25.924 --> 08:27.005
Keep her focussed.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.035
Take care.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.426
Ah, got yourself a winner there.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.886
Oh, sorry, Tommy Southern,
GB relay coach.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.745
Brian Johnson, shopkeeper.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.024
Shop... Ah.
I thought you were Shania's...

08:43.188 --> 08:44.839
Well, I give her a hand, you know.

08:44.982 --> 08:48.031
Oh. How do you think she
would handle being on the relay team?

08:48.235 --> 08:50.522
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Shania Andrews, Tommy Southern.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.857
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.229
Ask me what?

08:53.365 --> 08:55.732
I just wanted to say congratulations
You ran a really great race today.

08:56.826 --> 08:59.113
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

08:59.286 --> 09:01.209
So, I'm gonna be seeing you
at the Valley.

09:03.207 --> 09:04.572
Who was that?

09:08.503 --> 09:10.949
Am I dreaming?

09:11.130 --> 09:14.691
I pinched myself in the changing room.
I actually pinched myself, hard.

09:14.926 --> 09:16.928
It was a big step for you.

09:17.094 --> 09:19.574
You need to keep your times consistent
if you want a medal.

09:19.763 --> 09:21.925
I beat Lisa Temple in a race today.

09:22.098 --> 09:24.908
Did you see my time? Brian, did you
time me? Where was your watch?

09:25.101 --> 09:27.866
- Are you even listening?
- I'm listening but can I scream now?

09:28.062 --> 09:29.268
Yeah, go on.

09:29.397 --> 09:31.320
whoo!

09:31.482 --> 09:33.769
<i> We're going to the Worlds!
Who's going?</i>

09:33.942 --> 09:37.424
<i>- We're going to the Warlds...
- Well, no, you are.</i>

09:39.780 --> 09:41.111
What? What do you mean?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.641
- You're coming, too.
- I ain't coming.

09:43.826 --> 09:45.112
My job's done.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.433
What? No, listen.
Brian, they'll fund you and everything.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.353
Look, I promised that I'd help you
get in the door and I have.

09:53.793 --> 09:58.117
What? Where you're going, you're gonna
need more than one bloke and his dog.

09:59.089 --> 10:00.693
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

10:00.841 --> 10:02.843
It's up to you now.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.641
<i>Tara?</i>

10:14.770 --> 10:16.374
Yeah.

10:16.896 --> 10:17.943
Tara, I won.

10:19.023 --> 10:21.344
- Did you?
- Yeah. Made the national team.

10:21.525 --> 10:23.846
I get to train with them, and then
I'm going World Champs, everything.

10:24.028 --> 10:26.508
- Really? That's heavy.
- Yeah.

10:26.697 --> 10:29.507
Look, I'm going shop,
do you want anything?

10:29.700 --> 10:31.190
Uh, no, I'm all right.

10:40.042 --> 10:41.612
I did it, Mum.

11:16.323 --> 11:17.893
- Shania.
- Oh, hi, you all right?

11:18.034 --> 11:19.479
- Hi, good to see you again.
- Yeah.

11:19.619 --> 11:21.223
- How you doing?
- Not too bad. You?

11:21.369 --> 11:23.417
Come this way. Very well, thank you.

11:25.916 --> 11:29.238
Okay, so, our coaching squad will be
making sure you hit your targets.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.303
And we need to get you kitted out.

11:31.462 --> 11:34.625
- Who's your sponsor?
- Um, I don't have one.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.446
Okay. So, you've got your own kit then?

11:40.970 --> 11:43.018
I think we can get you
some better spikes than that.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.864
- Come with me.
- Okay, then.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.898
Stand by.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.628
Knees! Lift those knees!

12:13.666 --> 12:15.475
...dropping your shin.
Don't drop before...

12:17.419 --> 12:18.386
Who's that?

12:20.254 --> 12:22.018
Nobody.

12:24.258 --> 12:26.704
I'm just gonna speak to this new girl,
just go train with the girls.

12:27.970 --> 12:29.210
Hello.

12:30.263 --> 12:31.389
So, how you feeling?

12:31.514 --> 12:33.039
Bit like I'm going to be
arrested for trespassing

12:33.183 --> 12:35.504
but I'm all right, thank you.
How are you?

12:35.685 --> 12:37.926
Ah, you know,
divorced, stressed, underpaid.

12:38.812 --> 12:40.894
Think I found a lump
in the shower this morning.

12:42.607 --> 12:45.372
This isn't about me.
This is about you.

12:45.569 --> 12:48.095
You're here because you're
the third ranked woman in Britain.

12:48.279 --> 12:50.122
So how about doubling
your chances of a medal?

12:50.782 --> 12:53.228
- What do you mean?
- Relay.

12:53.409 --> 12:55.980
I've got a space on the team
and it's yours if you want it.

12:56.162 --> 12:59.052
Yeah, I've never really
run the relay before.

12:59.664 --> 13:02.827
Same principle as the solos -
run fast, win race.

13:05.086 --> 13:07.612
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm not very good with teams, though.

13:07.796 --> 13:10.845
- Come and meet the girls. Come on.
- All right.

13:12.384 --> 13:15.593
Hey. What are you guys doing
standing around?

13:15.803 --> 13:17.134
We're not standing,
we're stretching, Coach.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.992
Yeah, stretching my arse.
Limber up, please.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.302
Before you do, I want you
to meet Shania... Andrews?

13:21.475 --> 13:23.443
- Andrews.
- Shania Andrews, this is my relay squad.

13:23.602 --> 13:26.003
The fastest girls in Britain.

13:26.188 --> 13:29.192
Rachel, long jump,
Belle and Sarah, hurdles,

13:29.398 --> 13:31.048
Lisa Temple you know,

13:31.192 --> 13:34.082
and of course, the legend
that is Trix Warren, 100 metres.

13:34.278 --> 13:36.679
- You all right?
- I'm Carl, team physio.

13:36.863 --> 13:38.786
Welcome to the team.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.713
Carl will be yours
throughout the season.

13:40.867 --> 13:43.154
His brutal touch, your reward
for being a part of the relay squad.

13:43.328 --> 13:45.057
I'll be gentle.

13:45.204 --> 13:46.365
So, what, she's joining us, then, Tommy?

13:46.497 --> 13:48.864
Well, she broke 23 in Surrey last week.

13:49.041 --> 13:50.452
So, I think that's worth an invite,
don't you?

13:50.584 --> 13:51.915
Yeah, we'll see.

13:54.463 --> 13:56.033
Great. Well, we work around
everyone's solo events,

13:56.172 --> 13:58.652
so there's a relay practice
at the end of the week.

13:58.842 --> 14:00.048
So, are you up for it?

14:00.176 --> 14:02.258
- All right.
- Good girl.

14:02.427 --> 14:05.988
In the meantime, have fun, bond.
Love it. Medals. Let's go.

14:06.222 --> 14:09.032
-- Carl, can you pass me that?

14:09.225 --> 14:11.114
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

14:11.269 --> 14:12.509
- You all right?
- Cool, huh?

14:15.606 --> 14:18.257
I've dreamed about being here
my whole life, man.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.126
I can't actually believe I'm here.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.767
Me neither.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.092
Um, how about we just start again?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.595
I didn't come here to make friends.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.097
- Okay?
- Fine.

14:31.244 --> 14:32.894
- You must be Shania.
- Yeah.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.164
I hear you haven't got a coach.

14:34.289 --> 14:36.132
Why don't you tag along
with Lisa and I for the day?

14:37.334 --> 14:39.098
Yeah, all right.

14:44.882 --> 14:46.611
Okay, girls, I want to practise
your block starts.

14:46.758 --> 14:52.288
So, we'll run for 10 metres and then
we come back and do it again, okay?

14:53.597 --> 14:54.598
Watch your hands.

14:56.559 --> 14:59.802
Right, it's those first five paces
that really count.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.022
Heads down, weight forward.

15:02.189 --> 15:05.830
On the one. Three, two, one.

15:08.194 --> 15:09.605
Good.

15:10.153 --> 15:12.554
Nice. Nice, Lisa. Right.
Go back, do it again.

15:15.199 --> 15:17.247
Really drive those arms, yeah?

15:25.126 --> 15:27.094
And on the one.

15:27.252 --> 15:30.574
Three, two, one.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.705
Hey!

15:37.719 --> 15:39.642
Hey, what the hell was that?

15:42.307 --> 15:44.309
Come back, do it again.

15:55.318 --> 15:57.924
- Water?
- Thanks.

16:09.081 --> 16:10.651
<i>Barcelona, man.</i>

16:10.790 --> 16:12.758
I've never even been on a plane, so...

16:13.626 --> 16:15.469
Listen, the Indoors
are just a warm-up, girl.

16:16.045 --> 16:18.935
Barcelona's big,
but it's nothing like the real thing.

16:19.131 --> 16:20.940
Look, where do you
pay for all this stuff?

16:21.091 --> 16:23.332
Don't worry about it, babe.
It's all part of the deal.

16:23.509 --> 16:24.795
Take as much as you like.

16:24.927 --> 16:26.577
Trix is like the mother goose
around here.

16:26.721 --> 16:29.122
Hey! One kid at home's enough,
thanks, Belle.

16:29.306 --> 16:32.469
Girls, are we looking at chicken
or are we eating chicken?

16:32.685 --> 16:34.813
Mm-mm!

16:34.978 --> 16:37.026
- I'm starving.
-  Yeah, I can tell.

16:46.322 --> 16:48.893
jeez.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.485
What is it with you two?

16:50.741 --> 16:52.470
Nothing.

16:53.119 --> 16:56.441
I just hope we're all as lucky
as she was when it comes to the Worlds.

16:56.664 --> 16:59.031
I'm looking forward to beating you
a second time.

17:08.174 --> 17:09.618
Oh!

17:11.010 --> 17:12.250
Yes, this one can stay!

17:16.513 --> 17:17.925
I want you guys to go through
the first set of cones.

17:18.058 --> 17:20.185
Take a lane each.
We're gonna practise the walking drills.

17:20.351 --> 17:22.035
Slow, fast, high knees, okay?

17:22.645 --> 17:24.374
You go past me, it's 20 push-ups.

17:25.564 --> 17:26.724
Good work!

17:26.857 --> 17:29.940
Okay, check marks. Let's go!
Mark your lanes, girls.

17:33.029 --> 17:33.996
Hey.

17:34.114 --> 17:36.845
Simple, all you've gotta do
is pass this baton around the track

17:37.032 --> 17:37.999
as fast as you can.

17:38.534 --> 17:41.219
- Simple, right?
- Yeah, simple.

17:42.287 --> 17:45.769
Go!
Call it Loud and clear. I wanna hear it.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.444
H a n d !

17:47.583 --> 17:48.914
Good Speed!

17:49.043 --> 17:51.410
Trix, Lisa, go.

17:54.172 --> 17:55.253
Hand!

17:55.382 --> 17:56.747
<i>Good, Lisa.</i>

17:56.884 --> 17:58.966
Belle, Shania, don't take off
until she hits her mark.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.002
Go!

18:03.639 --> 18:05.129
Face forward, Shania!

18:07.476 --> 18:09.524
Shania, Shania.

18:11.062 --> 18:13.303
Okay, listen, you've got Belle
coming at you like a freight train,

18:13.481 --> 18:15.688
but you hold
until she hits her change-over mark.

18:15.859 --> 18:17.270
Then you fly, okay?

18:17.401 --> 18:18.971
Okay, go.

18:19.111 --> 18:20.636
Trust and timing.

18:20.779 --> 18:22.747
That's all it's about.

18:22.906 --> 18:24.556
Trust and timing. Got it.

18:28.077 --> 18:30.079
- Hand!
-  Come on, come on!

18:30.246 --> 18:31.611
I need silk, ladies. Give me silk.

18:32.706 --> 18:34.151
Hey, hey, concentrate, come on!

18:35.376 --> 18:38.346
- Hand!
- Good! Good, Shania.

18:38.545 --> 18:39.956
Yes!

18:40.088 --> 18:43.934
- You nailed it. Wicked.
- Yeah. Wicked.

18:44.175 --> 18:46.337
- Good. Now do it again.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.881
- Here she is, the golden girl.
- Hello there, Mr Temple.

18:55.059 --> 18:56.823
Great to see you, Trix.
How's the season going?

18:56.978 --> 18:59.549
- Going well, thank you.
- Good, we want to see you on the podium.

19:00.148 --> 19:01.718
You will.
Don't worry about it. See you later.

19:01.857 --> 19:03.222
Yeah, take care.

19:03.358 --> 19:05.486
- How's it going, Tommy?
-  Yeah, we're getting there.

19:05.652 --> 19:06.938
To be honest,
if some of the other coaches

19:07.070 --> 19:08.720
would give me
a little bit more time with the girls

19:08.863 --> 19:10.194
then I think we've got
a real shot this season.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.564
Well, you are the other coach, Tommy.

19:12.741 --> 19:15.142
No offence, but the relay
isn't anybody's focus right now.

19:15.327 --> 19:16.658
I've asked, I have.

19:16.787 --> 19:18.869
All they say is, "If you want
a team sport, go and play..."

19:19.038 --> 19:21.405
- Football, yeah. Thanks, man.
-"...football" Yeah.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.472
Dad, did you talk to them?

19:23.626 --> 19:25.116
- Yes, yes, I've done it.
- Good.

19:27.213 --> 19:29.261
Ms Andrews, hi.
I'm David Temple.

19:29.423 --> 19:30.788
Look, um...

19:32.133 --> 19:35.137
I'm afraid you're not gonna
be able to share Lisa's coach.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.268
They've built up a routine
over the years

19:37.430 --> 19:38.761
and with the Worlds
only a few months away,

19:38.890 --> 19:41.700
it's just too close to disrupt them.

19:41.892 --> 19:43.894
- I hope you understand.
- Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah.

19:44.060 --> 19:47.064
But don't worry. There's plenty
of really great coaches here.

19:47.271 --> 19:50.912
I'm gonna personally make sure
that you get the best one, okay?

19:51.151 --> 19:52.312
- Thanks.
- Okay.

19:52.443 --> 19:54.093
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.399
Wow. Charming, ain't he?

20:02.994 --> 20:04.325
All right.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.527
Well, I would.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.654
The man's
old enough to be your...

20:08.791 --> 20:10.395
My sugar daddy?

20:12.085 --> 20:13.689
Now, there's an idea.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.999
You're nasty.

20:16.505 --> 20:17.586
What?

20:24.179 --> 20:25.704
So, what's your story then?

20:25.848 --> 20:27.498
Could you stand over there?

20:30.101 --> 20:32.468
I started out as a runner,
400 metres.

20:34.605 --> 20:36.573
I was a relay reserve in Beijing.

20:39.735 --> 20:41.260
Turn around please.

20:44.071 --> 20:45.960
Extend that leg towards me.

20:50.285 --> 20:51.810
And the other.

20:53.997 --> 20:55.567
Okay.

21:00.586 --> 21:02.509
So, why'd you stop running?

21:03.339 --> 21:06.263
There's a slight curvature.
You might have tight quads.

21:07.008 --> 21:08.339
Can you face me, please?

21:16.725 --> 21:18.090
You seem very good at your job.

21:21.396 --> 21:23.558
Okay.  All done.

21:29.778 --> 21:31.018
Strong glutes.

21:31.822 --> 21:34.302
Could you take this
to Tommy for me please?

21:34.491 --> 21:36.016
Oh, yeah. Sure.

21:45.918 --> 21:48.080
Good, good, good. Keep that drive,
keep that drive, keep that drive!

21:48.253 --> 21:50.142
- Come on! Change, change, change.
- Stick.

21:51.923 --> 21:52.970
Again, watch that hand...

21:55.968 --> 21:57.254
Yep, YEP-

21:59.138 --> 22:02.221
Carl asked me to give you these.

22:02.432 --> 22:03.433
Mmm-hmm.

22:03.558 --> 22:04.684
Who are they?

22:04.809 --> 22:07.460
USA. The fastest.

22:08.271 --> 22:10.160
See how they move as a team.

22:10.314 --> 22:12.043
She knows when the stick's coming.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.397
That doesn't look like how we do it.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.932
That's because they use a downpass.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.912
The stick comes in a downward motion.

22:18.071 --> 22:21.871
Look, just like... that.

22:22.449 --> 22:25.214
Gives you a whole meter
of extra distance.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.458
Why don't we do it like that?

22:28.079 --> 22:29.205
Because it's very risky.

22:29.330 --> 22:30.491
Bigger chance of dropping the stick.

22:31.249 --> 22:33.013
Yeah, but if it's faster...

22:33.167 --> 22:35.329
Look, those girls
have been together for years.

22:36.921 --> 22:38.730
You see, they have got silk.

22:39.715 --> 22:41.365
What we have isn't even polyester.

22:42.592 --> 22:43.957
Bye- bye.

22:55.937 --> 22:57.746
- Hey, Trix.
- Hey.

22:58.898 --> 23:02.869
- Good first week?
- Um, yeah. It's all right.

23:04.278 --> 23:05.882
You know, I don't get it.

23:06.280 --> 23:11.684
So, the anchor, the last runner,
is meant to be the fastest, right?

23:11.993 --> 23:13.518
- Yeah.
- So why is Lisa running it?

23:13.661 --> 23:16.551
- You're faster than her.
- Huh.

23:16.748 --> 23:20.469
Well, that's because my daddy
was only a maths teacher.

23:21.001 --> 23:23.732
What's up, ladies? Doing all right?

23:23.920 --> 23:26.082
You lot heard about
this fundraiser on the 15th?

23:26.256 --> 23:27.337
No.

23:27.465 --> 23:29.547
My two favourite kind of people
are gonna be there.

23:29.717 --> 23:31.879
- Mmm.
- Fit men and rich men.

23:32.053 --> 23:34.659
I'm gonna find myself a crossbreed.

23:36.055 --> 23:37.386
So what, are we meant to bring a date?

23:39.267 --> 23:40.712
You as well?

23:41.602 --> 23:43.411
What? I'm just asking.
What you laughing at?

23:44.063 --> 23:46.065
Hey, I'm married, babe, not blind.

23:46.231 --> 23:49.792
Yeah, we saw you looking at Carl
with dreamy eyes.

23:50.277 --> 23:53.201
- Please!
- Everybody does.

23:53.405 --> 23:56.249
He's got that whole "boy band" look
goin' on for him, innit?

23:56.658 --> 23:58.899
I'm telling you,
if it weren't for them rules,

23:59.076 --> 24:00.885
I'd have climbed him
like a tree already.

24:01.036 --> 24:02.640
-- You know what I'm saying?

24:02.787 --> 24:04.789
Real talk. Mmm-hmm.

24:04.956 --> 24:06.321
What rules are you talking about?

24:06.457 --> 24:08.698
No relationships
between athletes and staff.

24:08.876 --> 24:10.560
It's an automatic sacking offence.

24:10.711 --> 24:12.839
Anyway, the Worlds
are more important than that.

24:13.005 --> 24:15.485
- Yeah.
- And, erm, be careful of Lisa.

24:15.674 --> 24:17.836
That girl's been hot on him for years.

24:18.010 --> 24:20.456
Please. She's the least
of my problems right now.

24:28.643 --> 24:31.169
Girl, you're trying way too hard.

24:31.354 --> 24:32.924
Like, why you going anyway?

24:33.064 --> 24:35.351
Do you really think these rich
white people are gonna give you money?

24:35.525 --> 24:38.290
Loads of black athletes get funding.

24:38.485 --> 24:40.726
Yeah, but they don't look like you.

24:40.904 --> 24:42.269
You know, you keep trying to run away

24:42.406 --> 24:45.216
but you've got like Primark
written all over you.

24:46.743 --> 24:49.030
<i>So you are not
who you are in the public arena.</i>

24:50.872 --> 24:53.478
<i>You become more who you are,
the more pr/vats you get.</i>

24:53.666 --> 24:56.146
<i>so I kick back,
play my pasition and try listen</i>

24:56.335 --> 24:58.542
<i> 'Cause there's opportunities waitin'
it's my decision</i>

24:58.712 --> 25:01.636
<i>The scene's getting ugly
And ugliness thats destroying the scene</i>

25:01.839 --> 25:04.968
<i>But I feel beautiful right now
so l get dressed...</i>

25:19.980 --> 25:24.827
Hi, Elise. Can I just have
a few shots? Thank you, that's great.

25:25.110 --> 25:27.112
"Hey, girl.
- How you doing?

25:28.738 --> 25:30.228
Hello.

25:30.365 --> 25:31.571
It's your time tonight.

25:31.699 --> 25:33.349
Yeah, any UPS?

25:33.492 --> 25:36.621
Um, ditch the O]
and get something stronger.

25:36.829 --> 25:38.877
-- Makes it easier to talk to these suits.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.040
Right.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.811
- Who's Trix talking to?
- The money.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.844
If she don't bring him that gold,
probably dump her for a younger model.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.375
- No!
- Mmm.

25:47.505 --> 25:48.552
I'll get a drink.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.481
We'll be cheering you on
to win that medal.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.873
You just keep signing
those cheques, Mr Aldridge.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.416
I won't let you down.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.918
Must mingle.

25:57.221 --> 25:59.269
- Baby...
- We'll be fine.

26:04.561 --> 26:06.962
- Mr Temple?
-  Watch your step. Smile.

26:08.981 --> 26:10.631
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

26:15.195 --> 26:16.959
Yeah, thanks.

26:42.386 --> 26:43.717
Thanks.

26:43.845 --> 26:46.132
- Oh! Watch it!
- I'm sorry.

26:46.306 --> 26:48.877
- I think you've had enough.
- What?

26:50.309 --> 26:53.074
What, you gonna get your daddy
to chuck me out, are ya?

26:53.270 --> 26:54.271
Excuse me?

26:54.521 --> 26:57.365
Daddy's little girl wanted to run anchor
so Daddy made it happen.

26:57.566 --> 26:59.091
- I'm really sorry...
- You mutt!

26:59.234 --> 27:00.838
Get your hands off me!
What do you think you're doing?

27:00.985 --> 27:03.431
This isn't some
after-school sports club.

27:03.613 --> 27:05.342
We've all worked
our entire lives to get here.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.094
I'm not gonna let you ruin that.

27:07.241 --> 27:09.209
Listen, sweetheart,
I can look after myself.

27:09.577 --> 27:11.545
- Thank you very much.
- Really?

27:11.703 --> 27:13.705
It's the night before a meet
and you're drunk.

27:14.039 --> 27:16.007
What kind of an athlete are you?

27:23.922 --> 27:25.128
I'm really sorry about that.

27:38.602 --> 27:40.411
Oi! Shania!

27:40.562 --> 27:41.927
Where you been, girl?

27:44.690 --> 27:47.011
Oi, what are you two doing
back together?

27:47.193 --> 27:50.720
Come on, man, she's my baby girl.
I can't let her get away from me, can I?

27:50.946 --> 27:54.189
That's love, innit?
So you gonna join us?

27:55.117 --> 27:56.960
I can't, man. I got a race tomorrow.

27:57.118 --> 27:58.358
- Come on!
- Come on, man!

27:58.495 --> 28:01.180
- Yeah! Yay!

28:01.372 --> 28:02.862
Come on!

28:02.998 --> 28:04.602
Yeah, all right.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.912
- That's what I'm saying!
- Come on!

28:11.256 --> 28:12.781
You're drunk.

28:12.923 --> 28:14.652
I had to be, man, to get through that.

28:14.801 --> 28:16.565
So, what, the party was crap?

28:17.053 --> 28:18.782
Yeah. You was right.

28:18.929 --> 28:21.216
- But this one's better.
- Yeah.

28:21.556 --> 28:22.921
It is.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.055
Be 900111, yeah?

28:33.525 --> 28:35.050
- All right, have fun.
- Will do, babe.

28:35.193 --> 28:38.675
Aw!
Nathan looks so grown-up.

28:38.905 --> 28:41.385
I know. I hate leaving him.

28:41.573 --> 28:42.779
Right, are we all here, guys?

28:44.576 --> 28:46.340
Guess Shania ain't coming.

28:46.495 --> 28:47.940
Oh, well.
Sarah's faster anyway.

28:48.872 --> 28:50.715
- Than Shania?
- Yeah, on average.

28:50.874 --> 28:52.922
- Oh, leave it out, Lisa, please.
- What?

28:53.083 --> 28:55.051
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- I'm just saying Sarah's faster.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.737
Not on race day, ladies, please.

28:57.921 --> 29:00.128
Where's Shania? Does anyone know?

29:01.800 --> 29:03.768
Sorry, sorry! Sorry I'm late, Tommy.
I'm sorry.

29:03.926 --> 29:06.167
Whoa!
Smells like someone had a good night.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.030
Okay, what is going on between you two?

29:09.223 --> 29:10.588
Let's just race our own races...

29:10.724 --> 29:12.169
Okay, well, let's do it, okay?

29:12.309 --> 29:14.277
- We really need to go.
- Yeah? Okay, great. Come on.

29:14.811 --> 29:15.858
Guys, let's go!

29:57.682 --> 29:58.843
Set...

30:23.246 --> 30:25.726
What is wrong with Shania?
She's faster than that.

30:26.374 --> 30:27.978
She's hung-over.

30:55.191 --> 30:56.636
You all right?

31:00.488 --> 31:01.933
Ugh!

31:04.032 --> 31:05.113
What?

31:05.992 --> 31:08.199
Look good and run fast, girl.

31:08.911 --> 31:10.276
That's how it works.

31:12.790 --> 31:14.155
Sorry, how you feeling?

31:16.084 --> 31:18.485
I'm just glad it's over.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.646
What about the relay?

31:23.258 --> 31:25.909
Yeah, you better throw up
a couple more times, girl.

31:41.148 --> 31:42.593
That all right?

31:53.867 --> 31:57.349
- Don't start.
- I'm not starting.

31:57.913 --> 32:00.200
Fourth place in that time
with a hangover's actually pretty good.

32:00.915 --> 32:02.440
Come on.

32:02.792 --> 32:04.760
Right, listen up. Come here.

32:04.919 --> 32:07.126
Even though this is an exhibition,

32:07.296 --> 32:09.298
you have to treat it like
it's the real thing.

32:09.465 --> 32:11.388
Okay, now, the longer distance
is gonna suit you two.

32:11.883 --> 32:13.214
We can win this.

32:13.343 --> 32:15.107
So I need good bends
and clean change-overs

32:15.262 --> 32:17.469
all the way, do you understand?

32:18.013 --> 32:19.936
Good. Now let's go out there
and show 'em what we can do.

32:20.099 --> 32:21.908
Let's bring it home, girls.

32:23.018 --> 32:24.383
Boom!

32:25.145 --> 32:27.193
Let's go! Come on!

32:48.832 --> 32:50.118
Athletes, on your marks.

32:51.709 --> 32:52.676
Come on, Trix.

32:55.630 --> 32:57.075
- Come on, Trix!
-  Go, Trix!

32:58.424 --> 32:59.471
<i>silencio, por favor.</i>

33:01.385 --> 33:02.750
Set.

33:10.434 --> 33:11.924
Home straight! Come on!

33:12.061 --> 33:13.586
Belle, come on, come on.

33:13.729 --> 33:15.094
Go, Belle!

33:23.946 --> 33:25.107
Hand!

33:29.869 --> 33:30.950
Knees high, Belle, knees high!

33:43.088 --> 33:45.136
Hand! Hand!

33:51.304 --> 33:52.669
Come on, Shania!

34:08.902 --> 34:10.188
Hand!

34:20.830 --> 34:22.514
Oh! What you doing, man?!

34:31.630 --> 34:32.757
Come on, Lisa, run!

34:34.842 --> 34:36.081
Come on, Lisa!

34:43.516 --> 34:45.723
I don't need to tell you
what that was, do I?

34:47.853 --> 34:50.221
No, actually, you know what? I do.

34:50.397 --> 34:51.444
That was shit.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.137
You're the fastest runners in Europe,
but together, you're awful.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.762
- It wasn't all our fault.
- Yes, it was.

34:58.947 --> 35:00.472
You win as a team, you lose as a team.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.113
Shania called too early.

35:02.241 --> 35:03.845
She's just not up to it.

35:03.993 --> 35:05.154
No, it wasn'tjust her fault,
I was late.

35:05.285 --> 35:06.252
Why are you sticking up for her?

35:06.370 --> 35:08.099
'Cause she ain't
a stuck-up bitch like you!

35:08.246 --> 35:09.327
Shania, shut it!

35:09.456 --> 35:11.026
- Oh, so what, it was my fault?
- That's not what I said.

35:11.374 --> 35:13.297
I'm sorry, I'm not risking my chance
of a medal because of her.

35:14.669 --> 35:16.956
- Hey, hey, hey! What did I just say?
- Are you dumb, Tommy?

35:17.129 --> 35:19.530
Her and her daddy call the shots
around here, not you!

35:19.715 --> 35:21.365
So if that don't want me
on the team then fine!

35:21.508 --> 35:22.794
Fine. I'm done. I quit.

35:22.926 --> 35:25.088
- Shania...
- Oh, shut up, Trix!

35:25.261 --> 35:27.502
I ain't your little project, yeah?
I hate all of you. I'm done.

35:30.515 --> 35:31.846
Mature, too. Great.

35:32.309 --> 35:33.674
We don't need her.

35:34.269 --> 35:36.317
You sure about that? Mmm?

35:38.481 --> 35:40.324
Jesus Christ!

35:44.737 --> 35:47.058
Don't give me another injury
to worry about.

35:50.825 --> 35:52.065
Tough day at the office?

35:54.912 --> 35:59.042
Do you know what? I'm a sprinter, yeah?
Solo. No more distractions.

36:03.128 --> 36:04.892
- Lisa's all right, you know.
- Yeah.

36:05.046 --> 36:06.810
Yeah, she's got
a very funny way of showing it.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.693
So do you.

36:13.595 --> 36:16.166
- Patellar tendonitis.
- Sorry?

36:17.015 --> 36:18.904
You asked me why I gave up running.

36:20.518 --> 36:21.883
My knees.

36:24.647 --> 36:26.376
- Carl.

36:27.691 --> 36:29.341
Duty calls.

36:33.362 --> 36:34.773
All right, man. What's up?

36:36.658 --> 36:38.547
Trix, I just want to talk to Shania.

36:45.123 --> 36:47.808
Not now, Tommy.
Please, I'm begging you.

36:50.586 --> 36:52.270
Look, I'm not gonna
force you into anything.

36:52.421 --> 36:54.310
If you want to be on your own,
then fine.

36:54.465 --> 36:55.830
But just hear me out here, okay?

36:58.468 --> 37:00.311
That race yesterday, it meant nothing.

37:00.470 --> 37:01.881
It was an exhibition.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.637
But when we get to the Worlds
I'm gonna need you.

37:05.808 --> 37:08.618
Now, the 4 x 100 metres
is where it's at. Okay?

37:11.688 --> 37:14.373
Hey, I told you.
I'm not good with teams, innit?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.170
Now you know what I mean.

37:19.569 --> 37:21.014
Okay.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.445
Okay.

37:41.881 --> 37:43.406
Whoa! What happened?

37:43.549 --> 37:45.074
Your sister.

37:45.218 --> 37:48.665
Look at what she and her boyfriend did,
letting strangers in our home,

37:48.887 --> 37:50.571
-stealing our things.
- Was it Daze?

37:51.348 --> 37:53.032
Why did I let her stay?

37:53.975 --> 37:55.545
Well, look,
I'll go and talk to him right now.

37:55.685 --> 37:57.414
You do that, but don't come back here.

37:57.561 --> 38:00.326
- I'm gonna look after my family now.
- What?

38:00.523 --> 38:02.366
I've had enough of you both.

38:05.986 --> 38:08.353
- No, look, I can... I can help...
- No!

38:10.489 --> 38:12.332
I don't want you
staying here no more, Shania.

38:15.368 --> 38:18.338
- Please...
- No. Not this time.

38:18.538 --> 38:19.949
Just get out.

38:38.681 --> 38:40.206
Daze, open the door!

38:46.647 --> 38:48.012
Daze!

38:48.148 --> 38:50.355
Who the fuck do you think you are?

38:50.525 --> 38:51.856
Who do you think you're talking to?

38:51.984 --> 38:53.349
Where' s Tara?

38:53.485 --> 38:55.806
Look, You know that girl,
she could be anywhere, all right?

38:55.988 --> 38:58.389
What are you lot doing at my Auntie's?
You've nicked stuff,

38:58.574 --> 39:00.224
and you break stuff.
She's chucked me out.

39:00.367 --> 39:02.688
Really? That's bad news, babe.

39:04.412 --> 39:06.813
Don't mess about with me, Daze,
not today, please.

39:08.207 --> 39:09.447
- Tara!
- I told you,

39:09.583 --> 39:11.472
she ain't here, man, stop this...

39:12.210 --> 39:13.700
You know what?

39:13.836 --> 39:15.725
Deal with this madness,
otherwise I'm gonna slap her.

39:18.091 --> 39:19.616
She's chucked me out, Tara!

39:20.259 --> 39:21.624
Well, don't go blaming me.

39:21.885 --> 39:23.489
What? What's wrong with you?

39:23.637 --> 39:25.799
You've got to go and apologize to her
or at least

39:25.973 --> 39:28.704
-pay for the damages.
- Listen, don't tell me what to do, okay?

39:30.185 --> 39:31.596
So, what,
you're gonna let me stay here?

39:31.727 --> 39:34.537
No. Daze don't like guests.

39:35.481 --> 39:37.643
- So where am I gonna sleep, Tara?
- I don't know.

39:37.816 --> 39:39.147
I'm not your mum, am I?

39:40.068 --> 39:41.513
Listen, right, it's about time

39:41.652 --> 39:44.258
you stopped messing about
and took life a bit more seriously.

39:44.948 --> 39:47.633
-- I got my own life to deal with.

39:59.002 --> 40:00.811
- Mum!
- In here!

40:03.631 --> 40:05.679
- There you are. How'd you get on?

40:05.840 --> 40:07.126
Silver in the 200

40:07.259 --> 40:08.624
and last in the relay.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.330
Congratulations.

40:10.469 --> 40:12.790
Congratulations? We came last.

40:12.972 --> 40:14.701
But you won the silver.

40:14.848 --> 40:17.772
You don't win silver, Mum.

40:17.977 --> 40:20.548
It's a consolation for losing.
And I know you're gonna say

40:20.728 --> 40:22.969
that that sounds really mean
and that I should just

40:23.815 --> 40:25.817
look on the bright side
and try really hard.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.052
-- Listen, Lisa...

40:31.113 --> 40:32.683
he won't reject you, you know.

40:34.199 --> 40:37.362
You're still his daughter
whether you win or lose.

40:39.746 --> 40:41.157
Really?

40:56.802 --> 40:58.213
In you go.

41:13.400 --> 41:16.324
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I got kicked out.

41:19.780 --> 41:22.545
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

41:22.741 --> 41:25.426
Why didn't you call? You could
stay at mine. I mean, you can.

41:26.036 --> 41:27.765
Thanks, Brian.

41:29.038 --> 41:32.087
Come on, get a shower at mine.
I'll give you a lift to training.

41:32.291 --> 41:33.975
No. No, I ain't going back.

41:35.461 --> 41:36.542
I quit the relay

41:36.670 --> 41:38.832
and I just want to focus
on my solo thing.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.489
Come on, I'll put the kettle on.

42:09.616 --> 42:11.220
It's pathetic, innit?

42:11.784 --> 42:14.594
Sounds to me like you need
a good kick up the backside.

42:14.787 --> 42:16.152
Thanks...

42:17.456 --> 42:18.867
Coach.

42:19.917 --> 42:20.998
Coach?

42:21.126 --> 42:24.016
Oh, come on, Brian. Please, man.
just until the Worlds.

42:27.256 --> 42:29.418
You do love to do things
the hard way, don't you?

42:29.592 --> 42:31.003
Yeah, you know me.

42:35.222 --> 42:36.906
Come on, then. Tea break over.

42:37.057 --> 42:38.547
I'll see you out on that track.

42:39.016 --> 42:40.427
Yes, Coach.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.611
Right.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.104
Come on then, back to the shop.

42:57.241 --> 43:00.290
No, let's do it again.
Come on. Let's do it again.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.188
It's no use rubbing that leg.

43:05.081 --> 43:07.288
If you're feeling tight we should
go back to that physio of yours.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.826
- Thought it was just me and you now.
- For the training it is.

43:10.377 --> 43:12.106
But we don't refuse help
when it's there.

43:12.462 --> 43:14.669
- I don't really wanna...
- I'm not asking, I'm telling.

43:20.428 --> 43:21.589
Hi.

43:23.222 --> 43:24.383
Hi.

43:24.515 --> 43:26.119
Um, do you have a minute?

43:26.267 --> 43:28.508
Uh, yeah. How can I help?

43:28.685 --> 43:30.414
Oh, it's just my quads
they're a bit tight.

43:31.438 --> 43:33.247
- Hop on, then.
- Thanks.

43:34.858 --> 43:36.747
Did you change your mind
about the relay?

43:36.901 --> 43:39.984
No. No, I'm back with my old coach.

43:40.195 --> 43:41.924
Just about the 200 metres now.

43:42.948 --> 43:44.313
All right.

43:46.201 --> 43:47.566
Ah!

43:51.121 --> 43:53.727
- Ow, that hurts.
- I'd be worried if it didn't.

43:54.875 --> 43:57.276
I didn't think this was part of it.

43:57.461 --> 43:59.668
I thought you just had to
train hard and not eat crisps.

44:01.506 --> 44:02.712
Yeah, me neither.

44:05.050 --> 44:07.451
I only got into physio after my injury.

44:07.636 --> 44:09.161
Before that
it was all about the running.

44:09.722 --> 44:11.929
Yeah, I'm sorry
you can't do that any more.

44:12.098 --> 44:13.224
It's all right.

44:13.350 --> 44:16.399
- You can run for me.
- Oh, thanks. Pressure.

44:16.811 --> 44:20.054
Well, you seem to be able
to cope with that... well enough.

44:20.898 --> 44:22.263
Ha-ha, very funny.

44:23.025 --> 44:24.675
I don't miss the pressure.

44:26.027 --> 44:28.507
I'd dream that I was running the race
the night before, every time.

44:28.697 --> 44:30.665
Hm! I know what you mean.

44:30.823 --> 44:33.554
In my dreams
I just run faster and faster

44:33.743 --> 44:36.269
and it all goes a bit blurry.

44:36.578 --> 44:37.818
Why are you running?

44:38.830 --> 44:41.356
I don't know. Maybe I'm
trying to get somewhere better.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.872
Do you know where that is?

44:44.419 --> 44:47.184
I thought this was a physical.
I didn't ask for therapy.

44:47.379 --> 44:49.461
Well, that I'll give you for free.

44:49.632 --> 44:52.795
- All done.
- Great. Thank you.

44:54.344 --> 44:56.312
This place isn't all that bad, you know.

44:56.721 --> 44:58.644
You just got to give
some of us a chance.

44:59.098 --> 45:00.668
What, like you, you mean?

45:10.524 --> 45:11.969
Um, I'm here for my rubdown...

45:13.694 --> 45:14.820
Doctor.

45:15.362 --> 45:17.171
But I can wait outside.

45:18.031 --> 45:19.271
Or watch.

45:19.616 --> 45:21.106
No, I'm joking. I'll wait.

45:36.547 --> 45:39.357
- How long were you standing there?
- Long enough.

45:39.550 --> 45:41.518
You ain't gonna say nothing, are you?

45:44.596 --> 45:46.837
- No.
- Thanks.

45:51.227 --> 45:54.834
Well, I'm fine, thanks, Shania.
Nice of you to ask.

45:55.063 --> 45:56.553
Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it?

45:56.690 --> 45:59.011
But I guess we've all
been focussing on our events.

45:59.317 --> 46:00.682
I just...

46:01.569 --> 46:03.333
I've been a bitch, ain't I?

46:04.322 --> 46:07.292
- More of an ostrich, actually.
- What?

46:08.492 --> 46:10.415
Sticking your head in the sand

46:10.577 --> 46:12.466
then running damn fast in between.

46:14.081 --> 46:15.845
You need a break, girl.

46:16.583 --> 46:18.347
Just don't get in that zone too early

46:18.500 --> 46:20.707
or else you will be loco
when the race comes.

46:20.878 --> 46:22.323
- Okay.
- Trust me.

46:22.463 --> 46:24.113
Then what are you suggesting?

46:25.382 --> 46:26.508
Hmm.

46:27.634 --> 46:30.638
- I'll see you Friday.
- What? What d'you...

46:30.845 --> 46:33.086
No, no. If I stick around,
you're gonna try and get out of it.

46:33.264 --> 46:35.551
I will see you Friday. Yeah?

46:35.807 --> 46:37.969
- Friday.
- Friday.

46:44.524 --> 46:46.174
- Is that her?
-  Yeah.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.870
- You didn't say she was coming.
- Sorry, girl, my mistake.

46:51.279 --> 46:52.769
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:52.906 --> 46:54.032
You all right, babe?

46:54.157 --> 46:56.364
So, this is a girls' night out,
I thought I'd bring some more girls.

46:58.744 --> 47:00.155
Right. Well, we're here now.

47:00.288 --> 47:01.699
Us mums don't get
to do this often. Come on.

47:01.830 --> 47:02.911
Evening, ladies.

47:04.166 --> 47:05.327
Come on.

47:15.384 --> 47:17.751
Ooh! Time to punch in!

47:17.928 --> 47:19.214
- What?

47:19.346 --> 47:20.916
Belle! What happened to
"a girls' night out"?

47:24.434 --> 47:27.517
- I'll get the drinks.
- Ha-ha! She's off.

47:29.146 --> 47:30.227
Hi.

47:30.356 --> 47:33.519
So, are you ready for the move
to the athlete's village?

47:33.734 --> 47:36.499
I think so. I'm really excited.
And you?

47:36.694 --> 47:40.460
I've won every colour of medal
in this competition,

47:40.698 --> 47:42.746
apart from gold.

47:42.908 --> 47:46.708
Or is that even really winning though?
Or is it just not quite good enough?

47:47.746 --> 47:49.714
Tsh! Sorry, I'm going off on one.

47:49.873 --> 47:50.840
It's all right.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.247
Yeah, I get it.

47:52.375 --> 47:54.981
- I've got to own it next month.
- You will.

47:55.294 --> 47:56.500
Come on.

47:56.628 --> 47:57.709
- What about the drinks?
- We're athletes.

47:57.838 --> 48:00.045
- We weren't meant to be sitting down.
- All right! All right!

48:13.935 --> 48:15.858
No, no. This just isn't right.

48:16.021 --> 48:17.147
Sorry?

48:17.272 --> 48:18.433
A gorgeous girl like you
all by yourself.

48:18.773 --> 48:20.298
- Tell us your name.
- Go away.

48:20.442 --> 48:23.127
- Just tell us your name.
- Can't you see my man's fallen in love?

48:23.319 --> 48:24.969
- Come, let me take a picture.
- No.

48:26.863 --> 48:28.353
Oi!

48:28.489 --> 48:29.615
Bet she's got ice in her knickers.

48:29.741 --> 48:30.867
Don't be so disgusting.

48:30.992 --> 48:31.959
What, you need thawing out, babe?

48:32.076 --> 48:33.362
Belle. Come on, Belle.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.542
Belle, come.

48:35.704 --> 48:38.913
- We're still waiting for that name.
- Yeah, Lisa. Now can I go?

48:39.124 --> 48:41.809
Oh, yeah!
There's some more sisters up in here.

48:42.168 --> 48:43.374
I know what this one wants.

48:43.962 --> 48:46.249
Is it now? You think you're
man enough to give it to me, yeah?

48:46.422 --> 48:47.628
I like a challenge, innit?

48:47.757 --> 48:49.839
- You'll lose, mate.
- I don't know the meaning of that word.

48:50.009 --> 48:53.218
Yeah, I'm sure there's loads of words
you don't know the meaning of, love.

48:53.428 --> 48:55.749
Like "deodorant" and "toothpaste".

48:55.931 --> 48:57.933
<i>-- just saying</i>

48:58.099 --> 48:59.100
Come on, Lisa, let's go.

48:59.725 --> 49:02.934
She's fine where she is.
Don't go disrespecting me now.

49:05.064 --> 49:07.305
Why don't all of you just piss off?

49:10.444 --> 49:11.730
Lisa, come on, let's go.

49:12.612 --> 49:13.454
Oi! Come here!

49:13.571 --> 49:16.051
Lisa, you really
shouldn't have done that.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.650
Come on, let's get 'em! Come on.

49:27.333 --> 49:28.380
Oh, my shoes!

50:04.283 --> 50:06.889
- That was so funny!

50:07.077 --> 50:09.967
Oh, I wish Tommy
could have seen that boy!

50:10.162 --> 50:11.926
Yeah, you did good
with that drink, Lisa.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.411
- Just getting started.
- Oh, really?

50:14.708 --> 50:16.312
Girls, where are we going next?
I'm not ready to go home.

50:16.459 --> 50:18.223
Listen, there's a club down the road...

50:18.378 --> 50:19.618
Take me, Belle. Take me.

50:20.505 --> 50:22.189
Take me to the club!

50:22.339 --> 50:23.500
Take me to the club!

50:23.633 --> 50:25.203
whoo!

50:37.520 --> 50:38.567
Girls, look.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.610
Okay.

50:40.773 --> 50:42.298
Now I'm sober.

50:42.608 --> 50:44.770
- Okay.
- It's not Long now.

50:45.068 --> 50:48.868
Hey. Sure we can't
persuade you to do the relay?

50:49.113 --> 50:50.353
Oh, no, thanks.

50:50.489 --> 50:52.218
Look, I'm a lot more fun
when I'm not in the team, innit?

50:52.366 --> 50:53.697
- Mmm.

50:53.826 --> 50:54.987
Yes.

50:55.119 --> 50:57.281
- Home time, girls.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go that way.

50:58.163 --> 50:59.324
Yeah.

50:59.455 --> 51:02.106
- Miss, see you in a month.
- I had a wicked night.

51:02.292 --> 51:05.057
- See you on the track.
- I'll see you on the track, yeah.

52:02.011 --> 52:03.456
Stay focussed,

52:03.596 --> 52:05.246
don't get distracted by the big lights,

52:06.514 --> 52:08.881
and stick to your
training programme, okay?

52:09.517 --> 52:10.848
Come here.

52:12.478 --> 52:14.924
Thanks, Brian, for everything.

I know it. Yeah.

Well, good luck.

52:23.029 --> 52:24.110
Thank you.

52:24.614 --> 52:26.298
You know, I wish Mum could see you now.

52:28.450 --> 52:30.259
Yeah, me, too.

52:31.370 --> 52:32.656
Well, come here then.

52:35.874 --> 52:37.444

- Yeah, me too.

- Yeah.

52:43.339 --> 52:44.500
Bring us home a medal.

52:45.590 --> 52:47.194
- Done.

All right, see you, yeah.

53:05.149 --> 53:06.514
Ready?

53:09.528 --> 53:11.974
We're gonna need to
get a cabinet for all these soon.

53:13.406 --> 53:14.532
Listen, um,

53:15.367 --> 53:16.414

53:16.535 --> 53:19.106
there's, uh...
there's something I want you to have.

53:19.286 --> 53:21.129
Oh, Dad, I...

53:21.288 --> 53:22.813
Keep it with you, it's for luck.

53:29.045 --> 53:31.332
Well, it's... It's heavy.

53:31.547 --> 53:32.708
Yeah.

53:38.220 --> 53:41.030
You look like you're going forever,
the amount you've packed.

53:41.222 --> 53:42.792
- Bye, Mum.
- I'll be there to see you.

53:42.933 --> 53:45.220
But don't put too much
pressure on yourself, okay?

53:45.393 --> 53:47.202
Come on, Ellie,
this is what she was made for.

53:47.562 --> 53:49.485
I'm always here for you. Regardless.

I don't think there's much you can do.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.800
But there's still hope
for our female sprinters.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:04.738
Before we go trackside
for the 100 metres final,

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.379
let's take a quick look at what

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:09.090
golden girl Trix Warren
had to say about the race.

01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:13.704
Buzzing. Ready. I can feel it
through every fibre of my being.

01:00:13.942 --> 01:00:15.751
I'm ready to go out there and do it.

01:00:15.902 --> 01:00:18.667
<i>This is the moment
that everybody in the stadium,</i>

01:00:18.863 --> 01:00:20.945
<i>everybody all over the country
has been waiting for.</i>

01:00:21.156 --> 01:00:24.717
<i>Trix Warren goes head to head
with the world's very best sprinters.</i>

01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:27.397
<i>LaToya of the United States
and Grant of Jamaica</i>

01:00:27.579 --> 01:00:30.059
<i>could be her main opposition.</i>

01:00:30.248 --> 01:00:33.172
<i>Can she get the medal
she's never won in the past?</i>

01:00:35.127 --> 01:00:38.131
<i>And now there's a hush
around the stadium before the start.</i>

01:00:40.966 --> 01:00:42.206
<i>Set...</i>

01:00:55.937 --> 01:00:57.223
<i>Trix Warren falls!</i>

01:00:59.315 --> 01:01:01.761
<i>Look at this!
Trix Warren has gone down.</i>

01:01:01.943 --> 01:01:03.354
<i>That is terrible.</i>

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:08.525
<i>LaToya of the United States
is gonna win it.</i>

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:11.304
<i>Grant of Jamaica second
Jacob in third.</i>

01:01:11.492 --> 01:01:13.574
<i>What about poor old Trix Warren?</i>

01:01:13.744 --> 01:01:17.510
<i>This injury that's been
blighting her for so many seasons now,</i>

01:01:17.748 --> 01:01:20.069
<i>has brought to an and
her final! World Championship.</i>

01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:22.697
<i>what a tragic day
for this gifted sprinter.</i>

01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.035
- Lift...

01:01:32.844 --> 01:01:34.846
Trix, believe. You're gonna be fine.

01:01:35.013 --> 01:01:36.936
- just stay strong like you are.
- She'll be fine.

01:01:52.445 --> 01:01:53.446
<i>The news from the 65 team</i>

01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:56.336
<i>is that Trix Warren's injury
puts her out of the games.</i>

01:01:56.532 --> 01:01:59.217
<i>this injury could spell
the end of her career.</i>

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.060
<i>Let's hope that's not true.</i>

01:02:01.203 --> 01:02:03.126
<i>I can only imagine
what she's going through...</i>

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.026
- I'm gutted for you, man.
- Yeah.

01:02:10.211 --> 01:02:11.975
I'm kinda gutted myself.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.400
But it's all right.

01:02:14.923 --> 01:02:17.085
I got family waiting for me.

01:02:17.259 --> 01:02:18.784
I've neglected them for far too long.

01:02:18.927 --> 01:02:21.817
- Yeah, but, Trix, I'm so...
- Don't.

01:02:22.013 --> 01:02:23.299
Everyone is so...

01:02:24.681 --> 01:02:27.412
So let's just not talk about it, yeah?

01:02:27.601 --> 01:02:29.285
Sit down. I want to talk about you.

01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:31.086
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:02:31.521 --> 01:02:33.250
You ran a good final, Shania.

01:02:33.898 --> 01:02:35.388
I'm serious.

01:02:35.524 --> 01:02:37.014
You've got what it takes

01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:39.438
to be one of the best.

01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:41.618
You just got to start playing the game.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.509
- What do you mean?
- Relay.

01:02:44.074 --> 01:02:46.156
- Oh...
- No, I'm serious.

01:02:46.326 --> 01:02:50.012
- Tommy needs you to take my place.
- I can't, man, that girl, seriously...

01:02:50.246 --> 01:02:52.294
Shania, this is your chance.
Don't waste it.

01:02:54.124 --> 01:02:56.855
All you have to do is run together
for less than a minute.

01:02:58.711 --> 01:03:01.078
Listen, girl, if there's one person
you do not say "no" to,

01:03:01.256 --> 01:03:04.977
it's a cripple that has just blown
her last shot at her dream.

01:03:05.217 --> 01:03:09.108
What, you think I'm guilt tripping you?
Hell, yes, I'm guilt tripping you.

01:03:10.722 --> 01:03:13.453
Promise me you'll go out there
and run that relay for me.

01:03:15.101 --> 01:03:16.068
Okay?

01:03:19.355 --> 01:03:20.766
Yeah, all right.

01:03:21.273 --> 01:03:22.877
That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:27.612 --> 01:03:30.343
- Silk, yeah?
- Yeah, man. Silk, whatever.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.040
Ready?

01:03:32.324 --> 01:03:33.814
- Bye.
- Bye. You take care.

01:03:33.951 --> 01:03:35.396
Yeah, you, too. Look after her.

01:03:35.536 --> 01:03:36.537
- Will do.
- See you later.

01:03:39.247 --> 01:03:40.612
Trix, thanks, yeah?

01:03:53.301 --> 01:03:55.702
Trix is out, yeah,
so I want back on the team.

01:03:56.846 --> 01:03:58.086
And I won't let you down, promise.

01:03:58.597 --> 01:04:02.886
I've just run my personal best,
so I think I should be back.

01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:05.145
I've just been talking to Trix and
she wants me back on the team.

01:04:05.312 --> 01:04:09.033
Okay, Shania,
you're back on the team. Go.

01:04:09.273 --> 01:04:10.604
Yes!

01:04:10.733 --> 01:04:11.939
Thank you, Tommy.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.787
Are you tight here?

01:04:19.908 --> 01:04:22.115
- You ready, Belle?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04:22.285 --> 01:04:24.413
You got big shoes to fill.
This is your time.

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:27.324
Now, I know you can do it.
So I've put you on the first leg

01:04:27.498 --> 01:04:29.227
because I know you have
that power, okay?

01:04:30.292 --> 01:04:31.657
- Mmm-hmm?
- Yeah.

01:04:32.794 --> 01:04:35.035
All right, here she is. Let's go.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:36.919
Come on.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.112
Okay. Listen up.

01:04:41.927 --> 01:04:44.373
Semi-final. Let's keep it simple.
I don't want anything fancy.

01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:48.138
And I definitely don't want anything
between you two, understand me?

01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:49.794
<i>Athletes to track, please.</i>

01:04:49.934 --> 01:04:52.062
Okay. Let's go. Go fast, go fast.

01:04:56.606 --> 01:04:57.767
Let's do it.

01:05:00.026 --> 01:05:02.267
- Shania...
-just please, don't talk to me, yeah?

01:05:02.445 --> 01:05:04.891
<i>this is the
women's 4 X 100 metres relay.</i>

01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:08.315
<i>The first four places will qualify
for the quarter finals.</i>

01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:10.900
<i>Here are the teams.
From Trinidad and Tobago -</i>

01:05:11.078 --> 01:05:12.762
<i>Proctor, McDonald, Cameron</i>

01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:15.987
<i>This is the first semi-final</i>

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:18.013
<i>of the women's 4 X 100 metre relay,</i>

01:05:18.167 --> 01:05:19.931
<i>and the big news is that</i>

01:05:20.086 --> 01:05:22.168
<i>Shania Andrews has come in
as a late replacement</i>

01:05:22.338 --> 01:05:23.942
<i>for the injured Trix Warren.</i>

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:28.379
<i>Now that means that Belle Newman
moves up to the first leg, Sarah Playaga</i>

01:05:28.635 --> 01:05:30.524
<i>then Andrews, then Temple.</i>

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:33.522
<i>And they've got to be in the first four
to make it through to the final'.</i>

01:05:35.808 --> 01:05:38.812
<i>But they've got strong opposition,
as you can imagine</i>

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:42.910
<i>The Jamaicans are there, too,
Trinidad and Tobago, and France.</i>

01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:44.990
<i>They're all very strong teams indeed.</i>

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.020
On your marks.

01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:57.070
Set...

01:05:59.203 --> 01:06:01.410
<i>They're off</i>

01:06:01.581 --> 01:06:02.662
<i>Ana' away we go.</i>

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.952
<i>The Jamaicans have got off
to a tremendous start here.</i>

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:07.173
<i>Jamaica are streaking away for it.</i>

01:06:07.335 --> 01:06:10.418
<i>Trinidad and Tobago are in contention,
but so are Great Britain.</i>

01:06:10.629 --> 01:06:12.074
<i>Ifs all gonna depend
on this first change-over.</i>

01:06:12.214 --> 01:06:13.375
Hand!

01:06:14.633 --> 01:06:16.795
<i>Ana' ifs smooth. 11".? good.</i>

01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:18.937
<i>And there go Trinidad and Tobago, too.</i>

01:06:19.095 --> 01:06:20.301
<i>A way go Great Britain.</i>

01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:21.670
<i>They're still the top three.</i>

01:06:25.685 --> 01:06:28.006
<i>Ana' here we go,
in to the second change-over.</i>

01:06:29.146 --> 01:06:32.832
<i>That's not bad, but Great Britain seem
to have slipped back to fourth place.</i>

01:06:33.066 --> 01:06:35.876
<i>they'll need to make
the next change-over count.</i>

01:06:36.778 --> 01:06:39.622
<i>One change-over to go.
The Jamiacans are in front.</i>

01:06:41.949 --> 01:06:43.280
Hand!

01:06:44.952 --> 01:06:49.196
<i>Oh, that looked messy for Great Britain.
Its slow. The French move ahead.</i>

01:06:49.456 --> 01:06:51.857
<i>Temple trying to catch up,
but if doesn't look good.</i>

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:54.442
<i>Jamaica, Trinidad, Brazil and France.</i>

01:06:54.627 --> 01:06:57.870
<i>Bad luck, GB.
The last change-over cost them dearly.</i>

01:06:58.088 --> 01:07:01.171
<i>What a shame. Just one place away
from making the final.</i>

01:07:01.424 --> 01:07:04.906
Belle, a quick word.
That couldn't have gone more wrong.

01:07:05.136 --> 01:07:07.821
Major disappointment.
A lot of time, effort and money...

01:07:08.013 --> 01:07:09.981
- What the hell was that?
- You were too slow!

01:07:10.141 --> 01:07:11.745
- That was your fault.
- Yeah, of course it was my fault,

01:07:11.892 --> 01:07:13.462
'cause nothing touches
the golden girl, does it?

01:07:13.602 --> 01:07:15.809
Oh, it's not my fault
your life is a screw-up!

01:07:18.398 --> 01:07:20.400
<i>-- Oh my goodness.</i>

01:07:20.566 --> 01:07:24.013
<i>The British team's emotions
are getting the better of them here.</i>

01:07:24.236 --> 01:07:26.398
<i>There's a fight on the track
between the British three and four,</i>

01:07:26.571 --> 01:07:28.016
<i>Andrews and Temple.</i>

01:07:28.156 --> 01:07:30.887
<i>Hardly appropriate behaviour
for professional athletes.</i>

01:07:31.076 --> 01:07:32.282
Oh, flippin''...

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.219
<i>But wait! 1"/71 hearing a report</i>

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:36.134
<i>- I will sort it out!
- There's a penalty against the French.</i>

01:07:36.288 --> 01:07:39.451
<i>The French team have a lane infringement
in their final leg.</i>

01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:42.954
<i>The French have been disqualified
Great Britain are through to the final.</i>

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:44.660
Are you joking?

01:07:44.796 --> 01:07:46.685
It looks like you have
a second chance. That's exciting.

01:07:46.839 --> 01:07:48.967
<i>Great Britain are back in it now</i>

01:07:57.766 --> 01:08:01.737
- She threw the first punch, Tommy.
- I know. I know, David, I saw.

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:04.504
Along with thousands of other people.

01:08:04.688 --> 01:08:06.611
David's right.
She's an embarrassment to the team.

01:08:06.774 --> 01:08:09.015
No, she's our fastest runner.

01:08:09.193 --> 01:08:12.322
Think about how this looks.
We're on the front pages now.

01:08:12.528 --> 01:08:14.451
Is this gonna make
your CV look any better?

01:08:15.406 --> 01:08:16.895
Sorry, what are you suggesting?

01:08:18.825 --> 01:08:22.432
It would be a sad end
to a not exactly illustrious career.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:25.553
Right. So she's off the team or I'm
finished. Is that what you're saying?

01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:28.877
We're not saying anything. What's your
conscience telling you to do?

01:08:43.264 --> 01:08:46.950
- Is this them or you?
- This is me. You're off the team.

01:08:49.644 --> 01:08:51.294
He made you do it, didn't he?

01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:53.185
There's nothing I can do.

01:08:54.524 --> 01:08:56.652
But you can't take this away
from me, Tommy, man.

01:08:56.817 --> 01:08:58.341
What I did was wrong before,

01:08:58.484 --> 01:09:01.136
and I know I shouldn't have
done what I did, but I'm sorry, I...

01:09:04.616 --> 01:09:06.743
Tommy's decision is final, I'm afraid.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:08.718
We can't let what you did
go unpunished.

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:11.350
You make us all, the whole sport,
look bad.

01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:13.859
- But I...
- Let's not make another scene, okay?

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.404
Okay.

01:09:16.877 --> 01:09:18.447
You know what?
Lisa's lucky she's got you.

01:09:48.446 --> 01:09:50.608
It's a lot different
from up here, isn't it?

01:09:57.745 --> 01:09:59.190
- This seat free?
- No.

01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:04.328
- How about this one?
- No, they're all taken.

01:10:18.973 --> 01:10:22.182
What you saw between me and Lisa,
it was nothing.

01:10:24.519 --> 01:10:26.203
She was upset after the race.

01:10:26.896 --> 01:10:28.500
Her dad...

01:10:28.648 --> 01:10:30.935
- Well, you know about her dad.
- Yeah, I do.

01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:32.918
I do, first-hand.

01:10:38.323 --> 01:10:40.974
Oh, what am I gonna do, Carl?

01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:43.241
I mean, they don't want me here.

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:46.540
They just want me to crawl back
to wherever I come from.

01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:49.956
A smug bastard says you're out
and you just give up.

01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:52.487
- You're really gonna let him do that?
- I didn't give up, all right?

01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:54.034
I was kicked out.

01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:57.959
Pricks like that can't always
get their way.

01:10:59.175 --> 01:11:01.576
And the Shania I know
wouldn't let them.

01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:06.545
What am I supposed to do?

01:11:06.681 --> 01:11:07.967
He's not exactly gonna
return my calls, is he?

01:11:08.099 --> 01:11:09.749
Nah, he wouldn't.

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:14.620
But I know someone who could
persuade him to change his mind.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:20.364
Lisa.

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:23.857
Oh, come on, we just...

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:26.031
we just scratched each other's eyes out
in front of millions of people.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:28.087
Yeah, and you also
just qualified for the finals

01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:30.562
with the worst relay I've ever seen.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:35.158
Now imagine what would happen if you
actually ran together as a team.

01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:43.343
You said it yourself. You always dreamt
about running to somewhere better.

01:11:45.131 --> 01:11:46.337
Well, start there.

01:11:50.386 --> 01:11:52.866
So go and get your arse back
on that track where it belongs.

01:11:53.806 --> 01:11:55.410
Did you just talk about my arse?

01:11:56.975 --> 01:11:58.818
I meant your glutes.

01:12:06.567 --> 01:12:08.535
Yeah, it's worth a shot, innit?

01:12:12.823 --> 01:12:15.827
Just 'cause I'm listening to you
doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:17.478
Come on.

01:12:17.618 --> 01:12:19.188
No, you can wait.
I've got a race to run.

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:26.078
-- Come in.

01:12:32.799 --> 01:12:34.563
I thought you'd left.

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.526
Um... Okay.

01:12:36.677 --> 01:12:40.443
So, the way I see things, right,
me and you got two things in common.

01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:42.843
Yeah. What are they?

01:12:43.015 --> 01:12:46.656
One - we both hate each other,
and two - we're both fucking fast.

01:12:48.312 --> 01:12:50.633
- So?
- So, I'm saying,

01:12:50.814 --> 01:12:54.375
if we get our shit together...
no one can beat us.

01:12:54.609 --> 01:12:58.580
Uh, I seem to remember you getting
kicked off the team.

01:12:58.822 --> 01:13:01.507
Yeah, and we both know
who's behind that, don't we?

01:13:03.492 --> 01:13:07.213
Look, I ain't gonna try and pry into
your family business or nothing,

01:13:07.454 --> 01:13:09.661
'cause I know if you tried that shit
with me, I'd rip your head off.

01:13:09.831 --> 01:13:13.438
But I'm just saying, there does come
a time in a girl's life, yeah,

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:15.556
where she just needs to
stand up for herself

01:13:15.712 --> 01:13:17.282
and tell her dad to
just stick it up his arse.

01:13:17.421 --> 01:13:21.312
Uh, nobody talks
about my dad like that.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:23.678
- No, and I'm sorry...
- No, it's...

01:13:23.843 --> 01:13:25.208
It's okay.

01:13:26.721 --> 01:13:28.132
It's a nice change.

01:13:31.851 --> 01:13:34.422
- Is that what you did with your dad?
- No.

01:13:35.687 --> 01:13:37.052
My dad just left.

01:13:37.188 --> 01:13:38.599
Oh.

01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:42.342
- Right. Sorry.
- No, that's all right.

01:13:42.527 --> 01:13:45.497
It just means he ain't around
to boss me about like your dad.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.124
All right then, tomorrow, show me
what you got, and we'll see.

01:13:51.534 --> 01:13:52.820
Why don't we do it now?

01:13:52.952 --> 01:13:55.080
Um, tracks are all closed.

01:13:55.246 --> 01:13:57.010
Oh, come on, man. Get your trainers.

01:13:57.164 --> 01:13:58.654
I know somewhere.

01:14:04.546 --> 01:14:06.753
- Uh, Shania...
- What?

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.161
Come on. Trust me.

01:14:31.528 --> 01:14:33.337
Again. It's late. It's too late.

01:14:40.535 --> 01:14:41.775
Just like the semi-finals.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.322
Just needs marked.

01:14:49.209 --> 01:14:50.973
Ugh! And again.

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:54.491
Ugh! Too late!

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:58.052
- It's never gonna happen.
- Yeah, it's all right. It don't matter.

01:14:58.217 --> 01:15:00.424
We're gonna get this. All right?

01:15:01.429 --> 01:15:02.430
Shania...

01:15:05.682 --> 01:15:07.411
We can't get our marks right,

01:15:07.559 --> 01:15:10.324
but it's irrelevant anyway
'cause you're faster than me.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.709
So let's swap it around.

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:16.144
What?

01:15:16.275 --> 01:15:17.686
Fastest runs anchor, right?

01:15:24.574 --> 01:15:25.985
All right.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.286
Sure?

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.991
Yeah.

01:15:38.586 --> 01:15:39.747
Hand.

01:15:41.089 --> 01:15:42.375
Whoo! jeez!

01:15:43.757 --> 01:15:44.724
Hand!

01:15:45.926 --> 01:15:47.166
Boom!

01:15:47.303 --> 01:15:48.429
Are you sure you're all right with this?

01:15:48.554 --> 01:15:51.285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:55.928
Hand!

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.759
- That was it! That was the one.
- That was the one.

01:15:58.937 --> 01:16:00.302
We've got it.

01:16:00.439 --> 01:16:01.600
- Yes!
- Finally.

01:16:01.731 --> 01:16:06.214
- Go for gold.
- Gold 2011.

01:16:15.286 --> 01:16:17.971
-- Excuse me. Dad?

01:16:18.163 --> 01:16:19.244
Hello.

01:16:19.372 --> 01:16:20.817
Can I just talk to you a sec?

01:16:20.957 --> 01:16:22.686
It's last chance today. You ready?

01:16:22.834 --> 01:16:24.518
I've looked at the American stats and...

01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:26.636
- Dad.
- Yeah, what?

01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:28.366
I want Shania back on the team.

01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:32.414
Yeah, um...

01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:34.288
Come over here.

01:16:38.347 --> 01:16:39.394
Is this nerves?

01:16:39.515 --> 01:16:44.919
No, it's not. We practiced last night
and we're really good.

01:16:45.228 --> 01:16:47.390
Don't be ridiculous, Lisa. She's banned.

01:16:47.564 --> 01:16:50.408
Yes, I know.
But she's the fastest. We need her.

01:16:50.608 --> 01:16:52.417
No, you're faster than her.

01:16:52.568 --> 01:16:53.933
No. I'm not.

01:16:55.112 --> 01:16:58.275
She's a liability. She's out of control.

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:01.334
- You got Tommy to take her off the team.
- You're better off without her.

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.616
So I'm asking you to put her back on.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.231
Darling, I'm just trying to do
what's best for you.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.896
Yeah, then put her on the team.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.580
This is our last chance at a medal.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.491
My last chance.

01:17:13.253 --> 01:17:14.414
Excuse me?

01:17:15.087 --> 01:17:17.135
It's mine, not yours.

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:20.351
Well, if you'd run
a better race in the 200,

01:17:20.509 --> 01:17:22.989
it wouldn't be your last chance,
would it?

01:17:23.178 --> 01:17:25.863
What? That's the reality. You lost.

01:17:26.056 --> 01:17:28.536
So now we can't have
any more distractions or fights.

01:17:36.273 --> 01:17:37.513
Okay, this is yours.

01:17:38.858 --> 01:17:42.624
I have spent my whole life
trying to please you.

01:17:42.862 --> 01:17:44.193
This is my time now.

01:17:49.243 --> 01:17:51.530
Dad, either you bring Shania back

01:17:52.454 --> 01:17:53.615
or I quit.

01:17:54.664 --> 01:17:55.995
-What?
- No, I mean it.

01:17:57.083 --> 01:17:59.689
I don't care
what you think of me any more.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:04.962
Win or lose, I am running this race
on my own terms, not yours.

01:18:12.597 --> 01:18:14.599
So, how did it go?

01:18:14.765 --> 01:18:16.210
I can't breathe.

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.318
--What? What!

01:18:19.519 --> 01:18:21.965
Lisa, what did you say, man?

01:18:39.662 --> 01:18:41.391
<i>Once again, we have a capacity crowd</i>

01:18:41.538 --> 01:18:42.824
<i>here at the World Championships</i>

01:18:42.956 --> 01:18:46.756
<i>for what promises to be a fantastic
final for the women's 4 X 100 metres...</i>

01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:48.730
- Get me another beer, please, babe.
- I'm watching this.

01:18:48.879 --> 01:18:50.404
<i>- Go get me another drink, man
- The British team facing stiff</i>

01:18:50.547 --> 01:18:51.833
<i>competition on the track.</i>

01:18:51.964 --> 01:18:55.173
<i>Can they put their differences aside
and bring home a medal?</i>

01:18:55.384 --> 01:18:59.355
<i>We're gonna watch four
British women bid for world glory.</i>

01:18:59.596 --> 01:19:02.600
<i>They've had such turmoil
during the championship so far.</i>

01:19:02.807 --> 01:19:03.774
<i>Can they deliver today?</i>

01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:06.053
<i>its been a dramatic road
to this final for the British team.</i>

01:19:06.227 --> 01:19:10.789
<i>Fifth in the semi-finals,
until the French were disqualified</i>

01:19:11.065 --> 01:19:13.113
One more shot, okay?

01:19:13.275 --> 01:19:14.561
Yeah, we can do this.

01:19:14.693 --> 01:19:16.741
- Hell, yeah, girl.
- Fists in.

01:19:17.195 --> 01:19:19.402
Oh, okay. Well, you know...

01:19:19.572 --> 01:19:21.700
I did have a big speech prepared
which you've now ruined.

01:19:21.865 --> 01:19:23.754
- Had it written on cards and everything.
- Aww!

01:19:23.909 --> 01:19:26.037
Okay, okay. You know what?
just go do it.

01:19:26.578 --> 01:19:27.739
Just go do it.

01:19:28.329 --> 01:19:30.616
- Boom.
- GB, come on.

01:19:34.293 --> 01:19:36.500
Come on, don't screw it up.

01:19:48.096 --> 01:19:49.666
Oi. What's up?

01:19:49.807 --> 01:19:52.617
I've never passed the baton in a race
before. I've always run anchor.

01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:54.255
Do you wanna switch?

01:19:55.395 --> 01:19:57.921
No. I'll be fine.

01:19:58.106 --> 01:20:00.234
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. We're good.

01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:03.642
<i>...welcome out the teams
for the women's 4 X 100 metres relay.</i>

01:20:03.861 --> 01:20:05.511
<i>Ukraine, Nigeria...</i>

01:20:05.654 --> 01:20:08.737
<i>.. Great Britain, USA...</i>

01:20:11.367 --> 01:20:14.735
<i>Great Britain start right next to
the favourites, the United States.</i>

01:20:14.954 --> 01:20:16.877
<i>And of course,
we've got the Ukraine in there,</i>

01:20:17.039 --> 01:20:18.200
<i>we've got the Jamaicans.</i>

01:20:18.331 --> 01:20:20.493
<i>We've got the world's
very best relay teams.</i>

01:20:20.667 --> 01:20:22.749
What's she doing on the third leg?
She's the anchor.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.808
David, sit down.

01:20:36.222 --> 01:20:37.792
On your marks.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.731
Set...

01:21:01.869 --> 01:21:03.633
<i>Well, that's a great start
by Great Britain.</i>

01:21:03.788 --> 01:21:06.837
<i>Newman is absolutely powering
around that top bend.</i>

01:21:20.887 --> 01:21:22.127
Hand!

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:33.732
<i>Superb performance by the British.</i>

01:21:33.898 --> 01:21:36.549
<i>Going into the back straight.
This is the long leg.</i>

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:07.076
<i>What a difference a day makes here
for Great Britain</i>

01:22:07.261 --> 01:22:09.662
<i>They're absolutely flying
around the top bend.</i>

01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:11.655
<i>A great run from Lisa Temple.</i>

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:15.375
<i>Coming towards the last change-over now</i>

01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:37.784
Hand!

01:23:08.106 --> 01:23:09.551
- Come on, Shania!
- Run, sis!

01:23:09.691 --> 01:23:12.262
<i>Heading towards
the line. Andrews gaining!</i>

01:23:13.903 --> 01:23:15.553
<i>Ifs gonna be dose!</i>

01:23:25.496 --> 01:23:29.467
<i>And it looks like a photo finish!
so, so close.</i>

01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:34.555
<i>I'm not quite sure who won that -
the USA, Jamaica, or Great Britain.</i>

01:23:34.837 --> 01:23:38.284
<i>What a fabulous, fabulous final.
It couldn't be closer.</i>

01:23:38.508 --> 01:23:40.556
<i>- What happened? Did they win?
- The stadium is holding /ts breath /mm</i>

01:23:40.718 --> 01:23:42.607
<i>waiting for the final result.</i>

01:23:46.097 --> 01:23:47.223
<i>Ifs Great Britain!</i>

01:23:50.643 --> 01:23:51.690
Whoo!

01:23:52.186 --> 01:23:53.631
- Yes!

01:23:55.105 --> 01:23:56.391
<i>What a comeback</i>

01:23:56.523 --> 01:23:59.288
<i>Have you ever seen
anything like that before?</i>

01:23:59.484 --> 01:24:01.691
<i>The closest final in years.</i>

01:24:02.612 --> 01:24:05.980
<i>Out of chaos they have pulled off
something spectacular.</i>

01:24:06.198 --> 01:24:08.246
<i>Its gold for Great Britain.</i>

01:24:10.243 --> 01:24:11.210
Darling!

01:24:11.411 --> 01:24:13.095
- Dad!
'Darling!

01:24:13.246 --> 01:24:14.657
Mum!

01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:17.800
Mum!

01:24:21.545 --> 01:24:23.673
I love you!

01:24:42.146 --> 01:24:44.752
- Come here!
- I told you you could do it!

01:24:51.613 --> 01:24:54.662
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, come on, talk to me.
World Champion...

01:24:54.866 --> 01:24:56.231
- It's amaz...
- Ah!

01:24:56.367 --> 01:24:58.131
Oh, my God! We did it together.

01:24:58.285 --> 01:24:59.366
- We did it!
- We did it.

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:01.224
-- Hi, Mum.

01:25:01.372 --> 01:25:02.578
Whoo!

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.572
Ah!

01:25:07.043 --> 01:25:08.204
Boom!

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.225
- We love you, Tommy!
- I love you, too!

01:25:13.466 --> 01:25:15.275
Go, go, go! Well done!

01:25:15.426 --> 01:25:17.030
It feels great.
Today they listened to me.

01:25:17.177 --> 01:25:19.544
Swish! Boom! What a great run!
