look good, guys.

04:06.860 --> 04:07.890
Shit.

04:13.230 --> 04:15.900
Amy Klein, nice of you
to join the meeting.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.560
20 minutes late.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.370
So, what about the story, then?

04:19.440 --> 04:21.029
WOMAN: I couldn't get
a verification on it.

04:21.110 --> 04:22.700
Oh. You're kidding?

04:22.780 --> 04:25.010
We'll send someone up.

Great job, Amy.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.140
Thanks.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.620
Hey, Klein.

04:37.690 --> 04:38.990
Nice reporting.

04:39.060 --> 04:42.390
How about you
show me what you learned?

04:42.460 --> 04:45.230
You want me to show you
what I learned?

04:45.300 --> 04:46.700
Right here?

Right now?

Maybe later.

Maybe not.

Hey, Amy.

Good morning.

05:12.990 --> 05:15.160
It's half past four.

05:18.530 --> 05:21.160
Charles, Amy's here.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.500
Bye.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.680
I detect that unique
and ubiquitous combination

05:29.740 --> 05:33.080
of nicotine and patchouli oil
that can only signal the arrival

05:33.150 --> 05:37.710
of the delightful and
world-famous Amy Klein.

05:37.790 --> 05:39.450
Eat me, Charles.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.320
You know, it's exactly that
lack of respect for authority

05:42.390 --> 05:44.550
that got you fired
from the "New York Post."

05:44.630 --> 05:46.090
I wasrt fired.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.290
I was reassigned.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.890
Of course.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.990
Lucky for you,
I opened my doors when I heard

05:51.070 --> 05:53.000
that you'd become available.

05:53.070 --> 05:55.900
And, by the way, I don't recall
ever being thanked properly

05:55.970 --> 05:58.460
for this reassignment.

06:00.740 --> 06:05.080
I seem to remember a similar
reassignment for you, Charles.

06:05.150 --> 06:07.240
Well, look on the bright side.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.770
We're back in the trenches
together, just like old times.

06:10.850 --> 06:13.550
Don't get sentimental on me.

06:13.620 --> 06:17.320
If this is about me being late
with my follow-up story,

06:17.390 --> 06:19.120
I've got it all right here.

06:19.190 --> 06:20.350
I was just about to...

06:20.430 --> 06:21.860
It's not about your story.

06:21.930 --> 06:25.420
Though I'm sure you're working
your usual insightful magic

06:25.500 --> 06:28.370
on what will prove to be
yet another eye-opening exposÃ©.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.840
I expect nothing
but brilliance in 5,000 words.

06:31.910 --> 06:33.000
Or less.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.010
But this, my dear...

06:36.440 --> 06:37.740
is better.

06:37.810 --> 06:40.440
What, then?
We're being sued again?

06:40.520 --> 06:43.010
Somebody mailed us this thing
about two weeks ago.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.680
What is it?
Porn or something?

06:45.750 --> 06:46.850
Something.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.520
Amy, with your encyclopedic
knowledge of skankology,

06:51.590 --> 06:53.990
have you ever heard of Deaders?

06:54.060 --> 06:55.190
Yeah, me.

06:55.260 --> 06:57.490
I owe two months' salary
on my credit cards.

No, not "debtors."
Deaders.

No, Charles, I've
never heard of Deaders.

you must see for yourself.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.680
Don't be frightened.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.910
Fear is where you go to learn.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.620
That's Anna.

07:23.690 --> 07:25.390
She isn't ready yet.

07:27.330 --> 07:30.860

learned the truth yet from him.

herself for you to see.

happen at Lourdes.

be interested in pursuing this?

You have anything
besides the tape?

Just a return address
on the envelope.

you think I don't have one.

It's what keeps me up at night.

supposed to say, "Be careful."

You don't know
your sister's last name?

Of course I do.

Look, Marla's a friend of mine,
and she's missing.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.990
I just need
five minutes in there,

You wouldn't be here
if you didn't belong here, too.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.400
I thought if you saw it
and started believing it,

24:45.470 --> 24:46.990
it might help.

how to get back.

here anymore.

But I can't.

your own demons to you,

25:14.030 --> 25:15.590

is no turning back.

don't open the box.

the box, but don't.

Ah.

29:38.930 --> 29:41.390
Now here comes a daring soul.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.090
A person committed
to a just cause.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.430
Another seeker of the truth,
no doubt.

29:48.670 --> 29:49.860
Are you Joey?

29:49.940 --> 29:52.430
I've been called worse.

29:52.510 --> 29:55.000
I have the pleasure
of meeting...

29:55.080 --> 29:56.010
Amy Klein.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.940
Amy Klein.

29:58.010 --> 30:00.410
Somebody named Marla
sent me here to talk to you.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.610
Mm?

30:02.280 --> 30:04.880
I'm looking for a girl
named Katia.

30:04.950 --> 30:06.080
And a man.

30:06.150 --> 30:08.420
A man named Winter.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.250
The plot thickens.

30:10.320 --> 30:14.160
Don't tell me you're mixed up
with those motherfuckers.

30:16.060 --> 30:18.550
Oh, jeez.

30:18.630 --> 30:20.000
Moral-quandary time.

30:20.070 --> 30:21.330
What should he do?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.300
What should he do?

30:29.510 --> 30:32.880
Why don't you just tell me
what you know about the Deaders?

30:32.950 --> 30:34.850
You first.

30:34.910 --> 30:36.810
What do you think they do?

30:37.520 --> 30:42.750
I think they bring
the dead back to life.

30:44.590 --> 30:46.680
Who are they, Joey?

30:49.860 --> 30:54.100
Some say he's like
this fucked-up guru.

30:54.170 --> 30:58.070
Some think he's not human,
or they think he's not real.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.110
But they all live together
in this house.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.230
Those who believe, I mean.

31:03.410 --> 31:05.240
Where is it?

31:06.950 --> 31:10.710
If you don't tell me,
someone here will.

31:14.050 --> 31:16.110
You know, that's the problem.

31:16.190 --> 31:20.250
You've got this fucked-up,
self-destructive thing going on.

31:35.510 --> 31:39.640
And that is making me
very unappy.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.110
Panduri and Kovacs.

31:46.190 --> 31:48.310
Okay? The northeast corner.
Two doors down.

31:48.390 --> 31:50.950
There are some stairs
that go all the way down.

31:51.020 --> 31:52.580
But once you get mixed up
with them,

31:52.660 --> 31:56.150
chances are you never get loose.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.690
Amy Klein!

32:05.970 --> 32:06.870
Don't do it.

32:06.940 --> 32:08.170
Don't go there.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.870
Change your name, go somewhere
else, become something else.

32:11.950 --> 32:13.880
Can't do that.

32:14.580 --> 32:17.910
I got that fucked-up,
self-destructive thing going on.

32:17.980 --> 32:20.040
Yes, you do.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.260
Only he can bring you back.

34:06.690 --> 34:07.850
[Shrieks]

34:07.930 --> 34:08.860
Aah!

34:12.900 --> 34:16.100
No!

34:16.969 --> 34:19.170
Where?
Where is he?

34:19.239 --> 34:21.170
Where'd he fall?

34:22.409 --> 34:24.880
Well, the men have looked.

34:25.510 --> 34:26.770
And he wasrt there.

34:26.850 --> 34:30.150
You don't seem
terribly surprised.

34:30.219 --> 34:33.480
What do you want me to tell you?
I saw him.

34:33.550 --> 34:36.350
Yeah.
So you've said.

34:36.760 --> 34:40.389
Can you tell me again just
what it is that you saw?

34:40.460 --> 34:44.260
I'm standing on the platform,
and I see this...

34:50.340 --> 34:52.900
He had his back to the train.

34:53.710 --> 34:55.230
That's him.

34:56.780 --> 34:58.540
That's the guy.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.180
- It's him.
- Hey.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.180
- Hey, it's him.
- Hey!

35:02.250 --> 35:04.840
Hey!
I saw what you did to Marla.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.680
Stop! Get the fuck off me!
Get off me!

35:07.750 --> 35:09.690
I know who you are!

35:09.760 --> 35:10.690
That's the guy.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.780
Get the fuck off me!

35:13.130 --> 35:15.820
Stop him!
What the fuck are you doing?

35:15.900 --> 35:17.330
Let go of me!

35:17.400 --> 35:19.890
You won't get away with this!

35:19.970 --> 35:21.060
Hey!

35:26.740 --> 35:28.970
[Whistles]

35:35.480 --> 35:38.180
You are lucky to have
a boss like me.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.620
Once again, I have saved

35:39.690 --> 35:43.020
your small but relatively
shapely behind.

35:43.090 --> 35:44.890
At least you got to travel.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.080
What were they gonna charge
me with, anyway?

35:47.160 --> 35:48.250
Charge you?

35:48.330 --> 35:49.760
They were thinking
of shipping you

35:49.830 --> 35:51.590
to the asylum for observation.

35:51.660 --> 35:54.960
Believe me, you go in there,
you don't come out.

35:55.740 --> 35:57.360
Got your stuff?

36:00.740 --> 36:02.640
Why did you give me
this story, Charles?

36:02.710 --> 36:04.140
Who else would have taken it?

36:04.210 --> 36:05.800
They're gonna think
it's bullshit,

36:05.880 --> 36:07.370
or they're gonna be too afraid.

36:07.450 --> 36:09.070
But Amy Klein.

36:09.150 --> 36:11.050
Tell me it's real, Amy.

36:12.220 --> 36:13.980
It's real.

36:14.590 --> 36:15.990
Or I'm crazy.

36:16.060 --> 36:18.420
Either way, it's a good story.

36:20.730 --> 36:23.820
You see, Amy,
for the average person,

36:23.900 --> 36:26.420
the hunger for knowledge
is like the hunger for food.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.490
We want to know just enough to
take the edge off our appetite.

36:29.570 --> 36:32.400
Then we're satisfied,
and we stop.

36:32.470 --> 36:34.770
But you are a glutton.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.900
You can't help overeating.

36:36.980 --> 36:40.000
- I don't hear you complaining.
- No, that's the point.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.140
That's why I still need you.

36:42.220 --> 36:45.240
'Cause all that stuff
I don't eat, I still want.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.220
So I send you in to do
the eating for me

36:47.290 --> 36:48.480
so I get to experience it

36:48.550 --> 36:51.180
without actually suffering
any mental indigestion.

36:51.260 --> 36:53.380
Thanks a lot.
So, I do all the suffering.

36:53.460 --> 36:56.220
Nobody's forcing anything
down your throat, correct?

36:56.300 --> 36:57.730
No.

36:58.460 --> 37:01.700
I'm not here to save people,
and I'm not here to judge them.

37:01.770 --> 37:06.400
I take them as they come
and use them as they pass by.

37:06.470 --> 37:10.340
You know, there's something
vaguely demonic about you.

37:10.910 --> 37:12.310
Did you know the word "demon"

37:12.380 --> 37:14.870
comes from the Greek word
for "knowledge"?

37:14.950 --> 37:16.440
No, I didn't.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.640
American education.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.810
Hop in.
I'll give you a lift.

37:19.890 --> 37:21.680
No, thanks.

37:21.750 --> 37:23.520
I need the fresh air.

37:24.090 --> 37:26.150
Then walk back to your room,

37:26.230 --> 37:29.420
lie in your coffin until
the daylight hours have passed,

37:29.500 --> 37:34.560
as is your habit,
then go get me my story.

I chose you.

You didn't choose me.

they need help?

afraid when you saw Marla?

Who are you?

Why did you do this to me?

57:09.910 --> 57:13.280
Who I am is no concern of yours.

57:13.350 --> 57:17.750
And you may be assured
that this is not my handiwork.

57:17.820 --> 57:19.280

When you stand there,
your flesh exposed,

57:22.550 --> 57:24.990

of your own blood,

57:25.060 --> 57:28.550
why is it that you feel no pain?

57:28.630 --> 57:30.860
Because I'm dreaming.

57:34.470 --> 57:37.160
Because this is a fucking dream.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.400
No!

journey through you, Amy Klein.

That's what I find attractive
about you.

That and the fact
you got a great ass.

all that different, really.

to the edge, to the extreme.

Just think of it this way.

An hour ago, I stabbed you
in the heart,

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.020
yet you're still walking around.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.920
Isn't that a bit unusual?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.060
Yes.

there's no such thing.

between being dead and alive.

face your past, Amy.

to stab me in the back.

only a rehearsal, Amy,

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.620
Let all the pain go.

01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:18.290
It is time for you
to finish your journey.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.690
Aah!

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.760
[Murmuring]

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.110
Yes.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.790
[Sobbing]

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.990

JOE Y:
Come on, Amy.

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:05.740
You got that fucked-up,
destructive thing going on.

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:12.710
I don't belong here.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.210
I'm sorry.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.750
You see, you're one of us now.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.720
All you have to do
is take the final step.

01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:28.730
Yes.

01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:30.770
That's it.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.960
I don't think so.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.810
Go to hell.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:15.410
No!

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:54.150
It seems that evil
does run in the family.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.740
Your lineage
is that of a craftsman.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.750
A maker of toys.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.880
You should have stayed
in the family business.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.660
I sacrificed my mortal self
to that box.

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:08.530
It's mine now.

01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.400
It belongs to me.

01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:14.340
Well, that's where you're wrong.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.240
Painfully wrong.

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.640
We belong to it.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.670
You can't hurt me.

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:25.640
You're not the first
to say that.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.380
[Rumbling, rattling]

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.820
And you won't be the last.

01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:38.120
[Screaming]

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.510
Help!

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:08.050
Help me!

01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:10.180
[Screaming]

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.970
No more!

01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:27.570
[Screaming]

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:36.380
When you were tempted
to live beyond death,

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:39.790
you entered into my domain.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.350
Oh, God!

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:46.090
You should be very careful
what you wish for.

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:49.790
Aah!

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:51.060
Stop!

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:52.400
Aah!

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:54.460
It just might come true!

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.600
Aah!

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.920
This world.

01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:12.460
It obviously
disappoints you all.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.750
That is why you chose to begin
this journey.

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:19.060
And since you gave yourselves
so willingly,

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:23.590
allow me to finish
what he started.

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:24.900
[Gasping]

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.480
[Groaning]

01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:44.910
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:49.390
So, Amy Klein.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.850
You opened the box.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.830
You brought us all together.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:58.160
And now you must pay the price.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.230
[Laughs]

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:18.690
It won't be so easy this time.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:22.210
Yes, your father is with me.

01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:25.990
And he is waiting for you.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.500
MARLA:
You're here to stop this, Amy.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.630
Don't let him take you.

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:35.500
Your soul is mine
and mine alone.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.540
Only he can bring you back.

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:54.520
There is no way back
but through me!

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.150
I didn't give my soul to him.

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:05.270
I'm not gonna give it to you.

01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:23.750
Aah!

[Music-box song plays]

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:04.760
[Rumbling]

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:14.460
No!

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.440
Witnesses say the building

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:21.270
at the corner
of Panduri and Kovacs

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:24.340
simply imploded sometime
in the early morning hours.

01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:25.710
It is unknown at this time

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.680
if there were people
inside the building

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:29.080
or if there was anyone hurt

01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:30.920
during the collapse
of the structure.

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:34.050
There are reports that victims
could be heard screaming.

Just talked to the police.

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.790
Still nothing.

She's just gone.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.990
Left her hotel.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.790
Left her clothes.
Left her money.

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:43.660
No sign of her anywhere.

See no Amy, hear no Amy.

Do you think something
has happened?

01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:52.340
I don't know.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.400
I just don't know.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.000
The firefighters have been on
the scene throughout the night.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.140
Too bad.
We may have a story.

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.950
The worst of the fires
seem to be put out.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.180
I mean, until all this happened.

01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:09.350
Other sources say
that it is highly unlikely

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:12.400
that anyone or anything
withstood the impact

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.560
from the destruction
of the building behind me.

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:18.800
This keeps getting
better and better.

01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:21.500
Your 3:00 is here.

a tape that I just received.

able to wrap your head around.

if you're willing.

and mysteriously undamaged.
