WEBVTT

00:06.606 --> 00:10.372
34, 35. Okay, that's everybody.
Okay. First stop is the touch pool.

00:10.443 --> 00:13.241
Line up at the dolphin gate.
Oh, stay with your buddy.

00:13.313 --> 00:15.611
Make sure you watch your step
as you enter the aquarium.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.988
We did it, Gus. A year of
planning's finally paid off.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.051
Don't you think we should wait
until they get a little further away?

00:26.126 --> 00:27.650
No. We have to move now.

00:28.061 --> 00:31.497
We've got 10 minutes to find a
dolphin, feed it, then ride it.

00:31.798 --> 00:32.822
Plus, my dad being sick

00:32.899 --> 00:35.595
and not being able to
chaperone, the fates are with us.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.033
It's a perfect storm.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.536
I don't want to
miss the otters.

00:38.605 --> 00:42.268
No, we won't. Um... You brought
your dad's camera, right?

00:44.811 --> 00:46.244
You're not sick.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.005
And you're not
very thorough.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.073
How did you know?

00:50.150 --> 00:53.142
Oh, maybe it's that snorkel
hanging out of your backpack.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.086
What kind of undercover operation
are you running here, kid?

00:56.156 --> 00:58.989
Plus, you left
this behind.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.628
If you're going to take time to
create a deception, do it better.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.594
Wait. Dad, I'm confused.
You want me to lie to you?

01:12.038 --> 01:13.403
No.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.637
I want you to make it more of
a challenge for me to catch you.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.846
Because
I always will.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.757 --> 01:32.748
Wait a minute.
Something's wrong.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.057
What do you mean? I mean
this doesn't add up, Gus.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.995
There's not really
a burglary ring

01:39.099 --> 01:40.623
at a gentlemen's
finishing school, is there?

01:40.700 --> 01:43.032
I'm sorry, Shawn. I made
up the thing about the case.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.764
I needed you to come down
here to do me a favor.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.032
Well, you know what?
This is a bad time.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.539
My dad just got
a new fishing boat

01:47.607 --> 01:49.541
and insists on taking me
out to kill innocent fish.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.077
And I can only avoid
so many things at the same

01:52.378 --> 01:53.367
time.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.547
All right.
What is it?

01:56.282 --> 01:57.613
It's a funeral.

01:57.684 --> 02:01.518
No. Absolutely not. You know I
hate funerals. They're depressing.

02:01.588 --> 02:05.547
There's organ music, and six times out
of ten, there's a snake in the casket.

02:05.859 --> 02:09.419
We'll just go really quick.
I need someone to support me.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.528
All right. Who's it for?

02:22.542 --> 02:24.669
Would you please
just tell me who died?

02:24.744 --> 02:26.541
I don't like all this
secrecy, Gus.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.103
And what's with
the aquatic theme,

02:28.181 --> 02:30.149
all this Ocean
Society stuff?

02:30.216 --> 02:31.615
Did Jack Costo die?

02:31.684 --> 02:34.118
Jacques Cousteau
died in 1995.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.518
Well, I don't think
these people got the memo.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.082
Come on, who died?
Who was it?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.716
One of those guys?
The boat guys?

02:39.792 --> 02:41.692
Huh? Was there
some kind of accident?

02:43.630 --> 02:44.722
Dude, I got it.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.859
It's the guy with the
horn-rimmed glasses.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.931
If there was ever somebody
with one foot in the grave...

02:52.672 --> 02:53.730
Sorry.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.299
You know, the camera
adds 10 years.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.139
It's 10 pounds.
Shh. Just shh.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.045
Wait a minute.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.123
Is this a funeral
for a sea lion?

03:12.825 --> 03:16.056
Yes. Yes, it is.
And don't start, Shawn.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.994
Shabby's more
than just a sea lion.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.032
He's a local hero
and a heartwarming story.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.727
I can't believe you made me put on a
dress shirt for something with flippers.

03:22.802 --> 03:26.363
The ocean is a little
smaller today

03:26.439 --> 03:30.432
with the loss of this
inspirational guy.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.541
Is that Randy LaBayda? Dude!

03:34.180 --> 03:35.909
They got Randy LaBayda
from Animal Planet.

03:35.982 --> 03:40.078
Shh! If sea creatures could
cry, their tears would cause

03:40.153 --> 03:43.748
the water level of all
the oceans of the world

03:44.023 --> 03:47.186
to rise an alarming
two-and-a-half inches.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.422
But Shabby would
want us to rejoice.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.226
I was the last person
to see him alive

03:53.299 --> 03:55.824
and some people think
I'm crazy to believe this,

03:56.169 --> 04:00.629
but as I returned him to
his home, Sweet Mother Ocean,

04:00.840 --> 04:05.504
I thought I actually
saw him wink at me.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.144
Just how famous
was this sea lion?

04:08.214 --> 04:10.580
He's the big
local story of the year.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.517
He was rescued by the aquarium
people, Shawn. Remember?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.713
Floating on that
loose raft.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.382
Then he died tragically after
being released out into the wild.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.382
Come and grieve.

04:20.726 --> 04:24.185
It's a poignant story, and I need
you to support me in my time of need.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.663
You've got to be kidding me.
This is an open casket?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.301
Shabby.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.807
You almost made it.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.810
But you touched our hearts
and our souls.

04:41.648 --> 04:44.242
Be free swimming
in the ocean of heaven,

04:44.317 --> 04:46.046
where there are
no natural predators.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.985
Good speech.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.519
Your turn.

04:50.823 --> 04:51.949
You kidding me?

04:55.862 --> 04:57.523
Shabby, buddy.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.761
You lived a full life.
I guess.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.699
Uh, probably balanced
a beach ball on your nose

05:03.770 --> 05:05.362
At some point.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.534
Maybe honked a horn
with your mouth

05:09.542 --> 05:12.602
<i>or barked the melody
of Grand Old Flag.</i>

05:13.112 --> 05:16.343
Clearly,
you ate very well.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.582
Oh, no.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.387
"Oh, no" what?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.449
I think this sea lion
was murdered.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.290
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

05:35.368 --> 05:38.531
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

05:38.604 --> 05:41.630
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

05:41.708 --> 05:46.042
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

05:51.384 --> 05:53.944
Why do you hate me?
I don't hate you.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.420
I'm telling you, there's
something unnatural going on here.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.049
We should go back to the aquarium to
check out Shabby's cage or something.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.457
He wasn't in an exhibit.
He was in the ocean.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.392
He was released back into
the wild three days ago.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.660
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need
to see you for a moment.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.257
Great, now you got me
kicked out of a funeral.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.062
Nice. Just add it
to the list.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.469
Kicked out of PetSmart.
Kicked out of Santa's Village.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.597
Kicked out of
the Salvation Army.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.232
Dishonorably discharged.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.474
Now, what do you mean...
I apologize.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.638
He's angry because I
tricked him into coming.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.976
I am a conservationist.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.313
I am an annual pass holder
at the aquarium.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.286
I am a registered aqua-blogger
with topic-starting privileges

06:28.354 --> 06:30.549
and level three-thread management
on the sea lion message boards...

06:30.623 --> 06:35.185
No. I want to know what you
mean, "He was murdered. "

06:36.729 --> 06:38.993
I'm a psychic. I work
with the SBPD.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.726
I also make
my own saltwater taffy.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.165
Wait a minute.
What...

06:42.402 --> 06:43.835
Why do you ask that?

06:44.270 --> 06:47.865
Because I've seen some suspicious
things at that aquarium.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.971
We can't talk here.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.437
Is there somewhere
we can meet?

06:53.513 --> 06:54.502
Yes.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.243
Dude, what are you doing?

07:00.319 --> 07:01.343
Cleaning up.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.355
But why?
This place is a mess.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.618
And it's not all the time that we
have an attractive conservationist

07:05.691 --> 07:07.056
come by the office.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.720
Oh, and by the way,
I call her.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.390
What do you mean, you call
her? You can't call a person.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.489
Why not?

07:13.566 --> 07:14.999
'Cause I already called her
at the funeral.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.126
You did not.
She touched me, Gus.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.465
That's because you
bumped into her.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.674
It doesn't matter. Contact is
contact. It's the rule, buddy.

07:23.743 --> 07:27.110
You know what?
Get ready for battle.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.148
"Get ready for battle"?
Come on.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.273
Yep.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.943
This is ridiculous. We can't go to
battle over a girl we don't know.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.418
I'll back off.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.751
You'll back off? Why?

07:36.956 --> 07:40.050
Because this is silly. Look,
you do your thing, you work it,

07:40.126 --> 07:41.753
and I'll stay
out of the way.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.625
You think I can't get
a girl on my own!

07:43.796 --> 07:45.491
Fine. I'll back off.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.396
I already backed off!
Too bad!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.196
Backed off what?

07:52.038 --> 07:54.666
Well, I was in charge
of Shabby's rehabilitation.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.198
And a lot of unexplained
things happened.

07:58.277 --> 08:02.714
First of all, they moved up the
date of his release by six days.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.179
And why did
they do that?

08:06.018 --> 08:09.681
Well, um. Randy LaBayda.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.422
Randy LaBayda?
From the funeral?

08:13.626 --> 08:16.959
<i>And Pacific Ocean
Aqua Patrol. Yeah.</i>

08:17.430 --> 08:19.694
I used to watch that show after
wrestling practice in high school.

08:19.765 --> 08:20.857
I was the captain.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.764
Yeah.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.735
Um, the aquarium

08:24.804 --> 08:27.671
did a personal appearance deal
with him a couple months ago.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.800
Put him on the ads, built a
Randy LaBayda manta ray tank.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.938
What? And someone wanted him
to be the one to release Shabby.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.207
And you didn't want
that to happen?

08:37.283 --> 08:39.581
Well, no.
It was too soon.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.485
Of course. LaBayda
shanghaied the whole thing.

08:42.554 --> 08:46.685
It was supposed to be a quiet
release with a local photographer.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.522
I got to the dock, the
photographer had been canceled

08:49.595 --> 08:53.622
and I wasn't even allowed on the
boat. No aquarium staff whatsoever.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.691
I never got to
see him again.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.737
So awful.

09:00.773 --> 09:04.402
So, uh, what happened
out on the boat?

09:04.977 --> 09:09.380
Well, no one knows. Everyone
got back late and a little upset.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.281
Then they locked up the ship's log
in LaBayda's office at the aquarium.

09:13.352 --> 09:17.015
April, we're going to need to get into
that office so that I can feel things.

09:18.591 --> 09:19.990
I can get you in.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.458
How soon?

09:21.827 --> 09:23.226
Tonight.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.398
Are you wearing
sweatpants?

09:28.467 --> 09:30.458
These are my
sneaking-around pants.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.367
Don't be jealous.
I got you a matching pair.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.167
You're dressing up for her. Dressing up?

09:34.240 --> 09:37.073
Dude, I'm wearing sweats and
this ridiculous lime-green jacket.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.974
That's my lime-green
jacket, Shawn.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.205
And it's only
for players.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.804
Okay, look. I backed off.
You need to get over it.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.715
Okay. This is it.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.246
What, is there like a
hidden door in the rock wall?

09:49.655 --> 09:51.486
No.

09:51.557 --> 09:52.990
You said you can
get us in.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.254
Yeah, I, uh,
I can give you a boost.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.553
The electrified security
fence is broken here.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.394
Oh, unless they fixed it.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.060
You don't work here?

10:03.135 --> 10:07.697
Well, technically no.
I did, until Tuesday.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.936
I was asking too many questions, and
LaBayda's producer, Tim, had me canned.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.911
Which is why
I asked for your help.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.040
You want us
to scale a wall?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.446
Is it too high?

10:17.516 --> 10:21.350
Oh, no. No. I could probably free
jump it if the ground wasn't so wet.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.546
You could not.
I could vault it.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.453
Where would you land?
Okay, listen.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.025
There's a door right on
the other side of this wall.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.324
It'll lead you straight
towards LaBayda's office.

10:30.396 --> 10:34.992
The code is 1-8-4-2. If I'm
wrong, you can just leave.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.435
If it doesn't work,
we're probably going to jail.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.564
Yeah.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.966
Who's first? Come on.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.844
See? She's legit.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.851
Legit? She just
boosted us over a wall.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.114
She does have very impressive
strength for a girl of her size.

10:56.188 --> 10:59.954
Okay.
Coolest office ever.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.318
Hello!

11:09.869 --> 11:11.393
What's this?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.001
Wait a minute. Dude.

11:19.311 --> 11:23.008
There's two laptops. Why lock
up this laptop over that one?

11:27.953 --> 11:29.944
Why does this
have a GPS on it?

11:30.022 --> 11:33.981
It's the only software on this computer.
And it's not picking up anything.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.994
Can we stop playing with this guy's
computer and get to the ship's log, please?

11:40.066 --> 11:41.795
Knock yourself out.

11:47.773 --> 11:51.072
This is all wrong. They were supposed
to release Shabby near San Miguel Island.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.167
Okay.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.610
Where they let him off is
nowhere near close to that.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.704
Why would they do that?

11:56.849 --> 11:58.248
We need to get
out of here.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.218
Goodbye!

12:02.088 --> 12:03.680
Okay. Let's get out of here. All right.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.087
Oh, wait, there's
one more thing.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.146
What?

12:06.659 --> 12:08.627
I have unfinished
business here.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.662
And a date
with destiny.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.161
No. No! You are not
swimming with the dolphins.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.497
When are we gonna have
another chance, Gus?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.867
I don't care, Shawn.
Come on.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.462
I'm in, I'm on it,
I'm out.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.736
Hopefully they have a harness
or a small saddle of some sort.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.106
I've charged up
my camera.

12:25.211 --> 12:26.838
You don't have to worry about
the flash. It's all digital.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.403
Just keep on snapping.
No, we are leaving, Shawn.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.383
I'm gonna ride that
dolphin into modern history.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.146
I'm going up top.
I'm staying here.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.554
You're missing out on the
opportunity of a lifetime!

12:36.622 --> 12:37.680
Please.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.649
That dolphin is not
gonna ride itself.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.591
Shawn!
Shawn, get back here!

14:01.073 --> 14:02.734
Get out of here.

14:02.808 --> 14:03.968
Not now!

14:05.277 --> 14:06.801
Quiet!

14:07.947 --> 14:09.539
Pa does not love Fa.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.580
No, Pa does not
love Fa.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.244
You're not listening.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.549
I'm sorry.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.055
Stop doing that!

14:21.293 --> 14:22.885
What the hell
are you doing?

14:22.962 --> 14:24.862
Conducting an investigation,
thank you very much.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.022
Then why do you
smell like herring?

14:26.098 --> 14:27.759
Because this is an aquarium.

14:29.268 --> 14:33.034
You're feeding him! We're about to go
to jail and you're training dolphins?

14:33.105 --> 14:37.041
He insisted. I had no choice in the
matter. I said, Pa does not love Fa.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.873
And your hands are filthy. Do you realize
how many germs you can transmit like that?

14:41.947 --> 14:43.039
Here. Give me that.
No.

14:43.115 --> 14:44.377
What? Give...

14:48.053 --> 14:49.213
Here, dolphin.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.880
You just
want to feed him yourself.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.982
I'm getting rid of the evidence.
And, yes, it's not fair that you,

14:54.059 --> 14:55.993
the person who cares less
than me about marine wildlife,

14:56.061 --> 14:57.392
gets to feed them
and I don't.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.021
Just throw it
and let's get out of here.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.789
Don't make a move!

15:01.901 --> 15:05.564
Drop the fish, sir,
and nobody gets hurt.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.740
Breaking and entering?

15:16.815 --> 15:20.273
It was really just entering. Climbing
and entering. We had the code.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.513
Is that a backstage pass?
And a Dolce jacket?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.749
I have third row center
at Phil Collins tonight,

15:24.857 --> 15:26.381
and I get called back here

15:26.458 --> 15:30.451
because my department's psychic wanted to
break into an aquarium to feed some fish?

15:30.529 --> 15:31.928
That is not entirely true.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.726
Then why were you
wearing swim trunks,

15:33.799 --> 15:36.267
<i>carrying a How To Ride
a Dolphin pamphlet?</i>

15:36.335 --> 15:38.826
Chief, that's a long story. The truth
is we're on the trail of something.

15:38.904 --> 15:39.928
Something big.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.905
Something important.
Slightly sexy.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.670
Chief, I think I can
shed some light on this.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.109
This is April McArthur.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.739
I did it.
Yeah, um...

15:49.815 --> 15:51.248
I couldn't let you guys
take the fall for me.

15:51.317 --> 15:55.219
I'm sorry, miss. You broke
into the Santa Barbara Aquarium?

15:55.287 --> 15:59.917
Yeah, well, um. I led them to believe that
I was still an employee at the aquarium.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.689
I got them the code for the alarm
and got them into the facility.

16:03.762 --> 16:07.198
She was also able to inexplicably
lift us over a security wall.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.063
Yeah. Chief, she has a good reason.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.898
She was actually
acting heroically.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.600
Thank you, Juliet. No, thank
you. And I like those earrings.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.869
Chief, there may have
been a murder.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.877
I can't believe
poor Shabby is dead.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.003
You, too, Jules?

16:21.080 --> 16:24.709
Shawn, the ShabbyCam is my screen
saver. We can all learn from him.

16:24.783 --> 16:26.978
Wait, wait, wait.
Who's Shabby?

16:27.052 --> 16:28.542
You don't want to know.
I don't?

16:28.620 --> 16:32.078
Yeah, probably not. Just know
I am taking lead on this case.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.649
There is a crime at play. Trust me. I
will straighten out these aquarium people.

16:35.728 --> 16:39.186
They do not want to press charges
at all. They like her. And so do I.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.755
We do not want to arrest this
woman. We need to help her.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.361
Wow! Well, thank you
for that endorsement, O'Hara.

16:45.437 --> 16:49.430
Now, I have to get back to the
Bowl. Somebody needs to take me,

16:49.508 --> 16:53.274
<i>because if I miss Against All Odds,
then somebody is getting fired.</i>

16:54.813 --> 16:57.611
I missed it?
They released you already?

16:58.083 --> 17:01.143
Lassy, it was all a big
misunderstanding. We're working a case.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.653
Jules is helping out.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.848
We are solving
a heinous crime.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.824
Heinous crime?
Wait a minute.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.222
How heinous?

17:10.829 --> 17:14.230
Look, it's not a big deal. There may
have been a murder. We've got it covered.

17:14.299 --> 17:15.391
I just need a name.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.224
I'd rather not.

17:17.502 --> 17:20.768
Listen. You guys don't know what I've
been through these last couple weeks.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.396
I chased down a group
of diamond smugglers.

17:22.473 --> 17:23.941
Congratulations.
Not exactly.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.842
I chased them to an airport, where
a plane was waiting for them. Wait.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.614
What does "Rocinante"
mean to you?

17:29.681 --> 17:31.774
A full-bodied Syrah. A
gay couple from Lisbon?

17:31.850 --> 17:34.284
No, it was the name of their plane.
It flew off into a lightning storm.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.947
I wanted to chase them, but
apparently our helicopters only fly

17:37.022 --> 17:39.149
<i>when there's rainbows in the
sky, so they got away clean,</i>

17:39.224 --> 17:41.454
which mean I'm officially
jackass number one around here.

17:41.527 --> 17:42.789
I need a case.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.223
Give me
the victim's name.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.434
Shabby.
Shabby.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.472
Is that a street name?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.235
It's more of a given name.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.539
Last name?
He doesn't have one.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.475
Do not play with me.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.776
Can I spell it?
I don't care.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.350
T- H-E.
T- H-E...

18:06.919 --> 18:08.784
S- E-A.
... S -E-A...

18:08.854 --> 18:10.344
L- I-O...

18:12.691 --> 18:13.680
N?

18:14.226 --> 18:15.716
<i>Thesealion?</i>

18:16.061 --> 18:17.858
What is that? French?

18:18.831 --> 18:19.855
Pinniped.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.060
Pinniped? Never heard of
it. All right, description?

18:23.135 --> 18:24.159
Black.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.362
Black. Height and weight?

18:25.437 --> 18:27.598
Six, seven hundred pounds.

18:27.673 --> 18:28.731
Jeez, Louise!

18:28.807 --> 18:30.468
Listen,
can you get a body exhumed?

18:30.542 --> 18:33.443
Of course I can. As long
as I'm in on the autopsy.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.780
I'm going to
kill you, Spencer.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.823
I never told you that the
victim wasn't a sea lion.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.891
Carlton, I tried to
keep you out of this.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.290
Uh, how long
is this gonna take?

18:48.360 --> 18:51.659
I don't know. I've never examined
one of these things before.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.095
Okay, that's fair.

18:53.398 --> 18:56.561
Are there any signs of, uh...
I don't know, foul play?

18:56.635 --> 18:58.728
Well, a couple of things
are odd.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.863
I found a strange
empty piercing.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.964
Maybe he started swimming
with the wrong crowd.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.906
You didn't happen to
find any tattoos, did you?

19:04.977 --> 19:05.966
Carlton!

19:06.044 --> 19:08.774
Well, I found some flat
reef coral in the fur.

19:08.881 --> 19:09.939
How is that possible?

19:10.015 --> 19:11.846
Yeah! Coral!
In the ocean!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.441
Are you really
asking that question?

19:13.519 --> 19:15.316
A sea lion
is a precision animal.

19:15.387 --> 19:17.719
It knows how to swim around a
reef without thrashing into it.

19:17.789 --> 19:18.881
That's true.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.357
And I found some
synthetic fibers.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.820
Okay! What kind
of fibers?

19:23.896 --> 19:26.558
Monofilament line. The
kind found in fishing nets?

19:26.632 --> 19:29.294
All right. I've heard enough. Close
this thing up. Let's go, O'Hara.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.336
Lassy, you're not being
very helpful right now.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.633
Really? Well, let me see if I can
close this case for you right now.

19:33.705 --> 19:37.197
Now, I'm no expert, but let me
take a shot. You've got a sea lion,

19:37.276 --> 19:40.837
and you've got a net and you've got
the ocean. You put them all together,

19:41.079 --> 19:42.307
case closed.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.748
What?

19:49.821 --> 19:51.448
I'm worried
he might be right.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.548
Are you serious?
I don't know, Gus.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.819
We definitely need to see that reef.
And I know how we can get out there.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.964
All right. That's it, that's it.
Your hands are at ten and two.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.667
Down there, that's
your trim tab.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.539
Over there, your heat gauge.
That's your fish finder. GPS.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.772
Uses waypoints, just like in a
car when you find a place you like.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.212
Look at that. You got a little
microwave down there. Would you... Shawn!

20:17.282 --> 20:19.307
Please focus.
Look forward.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.352
Do not become complacent
just because it's water.

20:22.354 --> 20:23.981
Dad, we're still
in the dock.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.050
Look, Shawn. Do you wanna
drive this thing or not?

20:27.125 --> 20:29.252
I never asked that!
Isn't that right, Gus?

20:29.328 --> 20:31.023
Yeah, I'm gonna get
in the middle of that.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.793
Man, I just wanted to come see your
new boat, go out onto the reef...

20:34.866 --> 20:35.890
The reef?

20:35.968 --> 20:37.868
I'm not going out on the reef.
That place is restricted waters.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.301
What if I told you
it was for a case?

20:39.371 --> 20:40.497
Well, that would
make it worse.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.763
What if he didn't?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.865
Look, we won't tell anyone,
okay? We totally promise.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.569
Plus, it'll totally
solve a crime.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.738
Shawn, would you please listen to
me? I'm not going out onto the reef.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.476
That place is off-limits to people.
I'm not going to lose my boat,

20:51.550 --> 20:55.008
I'm not gonna lose my license to follow
some stupid, lame-ass hunch of yours.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.213
You're really not
gonna budge on this?

20:56.288 --> 20:57.687
What do you think?

20:58.857 --> 20:59.881
Told you.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.950
All right! All right! I do!
I wanna learn how to drive.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.191
Shawn, hold up a second.
I wanna grab my tackle box.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.267
Shawn! Shawn! No!
Shawn!

21:12.337 --> 21:13.702
Don't worry, it's cool. It's
cool. What are you doing?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.171
Get back here!

21:15.574 --> 21:16.563
He's gonna come
after us!

21:16.642 --> 21:19.372
No, he can't swim that fast.
Besides, he wanted me to do this.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.672
Shawn!

21:20.746 --> 21:23.237
He wanted you to steal his boat? Yeah.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.916
He didn't want to be responsible for
crossing over into restricted waters.

21:25.984 --> 21:27.008
Shawn! Get back here!

21:27.085 --> 21:29.952
Didn't you get that with the whole, "Shawn,
Shawn, let me show you how to drive"?

21:30.022 --> 21:31.922
I think he wanted to
show you how to drive.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.321
Yeah, so I could
steal it later.

21:44.169 --> 21:47.969
This thing's all numbers. It's very
hard to read. Maybe it's upside down.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.167
<i>First of all, Shawn,
that's a Thomas Guide.</i>

21:50.242 --> 21:53.234
Ah! I thought it was a
little land-heavy. But look,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.940
I think the reef is down
here in the corner. A-7.

21:56.014 --> 21:59.245
Did you listen to anything your
dad said? The map is the screen.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.651
Gus, don't be exactly half of
an 11-pound black forest ham.

22:03.221 --> 22:04.620
That's clearly the GPS.

22:04.690 --> 22:08.182
Exactly. It's latitude and
longitude. You follow the degrees.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.687
Oh, yeah?

22:10.195 --> 22:12.288
Those numbers with the little
quotation marks there?

22:12.364 --> 22:13.353
Yes.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.527
Dude! I think I know
where it may have gone down.

22:19.604 --> 22:23.472
That laptop was probably tracking
LaBayda's boat. Here. Here. Punch this in.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.138
34 degrees,
zero-six,

22:26.211 --> 22:27.872
<i>and then, uh, one of those
little lines that I would use</i>

22:27.946 --> 22:30.471
<i>to, uh, to make a
winky face in a text.</i>

22:30.549 --> 22:31.573
No, no, no,
go back, go back.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.208
It should be the left eye
that's winking, not the right.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.309
No... Gus,

22:34.386 --> 22:35.819
pretend the person doesn't
even have a right eye.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.481
No ocular socket
whatsoever. Sutured shut.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.785
From birth.
Shawn, I got it.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.520
Yes! That's it, right there. That's
good. Okay. Now, 50 degrees...

22:43.462 --> 22:44.656
Come on, buddy!

22:47.165 --> 22:51.067
Two degrees to the right.
No. Up. Two degrees up.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.626
What do those two
little dots mean again?

22:52.704 --> 22:55.639
Kick out the lights. Oh, dude, we're
getting close. Right on top of it.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.675
Kick out the lights. Why am
I gonna kick out the lights?

22:57.743 --> 22:59.904
I think I see another boat
out in the distance.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.379
Where is another boat? It
doesn't matter where, Shawn.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.778
We're in
restricted waters.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.578
I can't get arrested twice
in the same week.

23:05.784 --> 23:07.979
You might have a few arrests
in you, but I don't. Okay. Fine.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.287
Did you hear
something?

23:18.363 --> 23:19.557
Like what?

23:19.865 --> 23:22.333
Like voices.

23:27.806 --> 23:29.000
Take him!
What?

23:29.074 --> 23:30.473
I had this dream
before, Shawn.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.806
<i>Ever since we saw Dead Calm. You
have to take one for the team.</i>

23:32.878 --> 23:34.277
What are you talking about?
Take one for the team!

23:34.346 --> 23:36.405
But no one's gonna hurt us. Hey, guys.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.881
These are restricted waters.
What the heck you doing out here?

23:38.950 --> 23:43.751
Ahoy there! Um, yes. Right.
Uh, my name is Shawn Spencer.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.924
This is my first mate,
Hummingbird Saltalamaccia. Hello!

23:47.793 --> 23:50.489
We were turned around.
Discombobulated.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.689
We just now realized that
we're in restricted waters.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.460
Just now. And we both
have hepatitis.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.970
I also couldn't help but notice
you are not the Coast Guard.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.267
No. No, we thought you were the
Coast Guard coming to tow us in.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.671
Us?
Yeah.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.573
No, no.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.613
But does that mean that they're
coming? And if so, do you have an ETA?

24:08.680 --> 24:11.615
No. No idea. We just... we've been,
uh, drifting for about an hour.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.310
We stalled on our way
to Monterey.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.785
<i>Ah! Old Mexico.</i>

24:15.854 --> 24:18.482
Monterrey, Mexico is 2,000
miles inland, Shawn.

24:18.557 --> 24:22.653
Up north. So, what are
you guys doing out here?

24:22.727 --> 24:26.390
Oh, you know. Just, uh,
hiding from sharks.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.558
Yeah, we heard that they can
see you if your lights are on,

24:28.667 --> 24:30.134
so we kicked ours off.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.433
Uh, that's not how
sharks work at all.

24:33.505 --> 24:37.669
Regular sharks. Of course. Right.
But we heard there was an infestation

24:37.742 --> 24:42.839
of genetically-altered, shark-like
beasts here, in this area of the water.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.672
They can smell the light.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.341
They also type. True.

24:46.418 --> 24:48.147
What?
Not well.

24:48.587 --> 24:52.614
But they're sharks, with fins,
so it's still impressive.

24:53.592 --> 24:57.187
Oh, and, uh, how long did you say
before the Coast Guard gets here?

24:57.262 --> 25:00.527
They're not just right around
the corner or anything, are they?

25:02.133 --> 25:04.624
I'm telling you, Gus, there's
something wrong with those guys.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.466
Did you want to stay out
there and chat it up with them?

25:06.538 --> 25:10.372
No, but we may not be the only ones out
there looking for the sea lion's killer.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.338
Uh-uh.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.106
Maybe he didn't want me
to take the boat.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.306
I'm jumping out here.

25:16.381 --> 25:17.575
Okay, but you're
gonna get wet.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.313
I can't believe this, Shawn. I'm gonna
get arrested two times in one week.

25:22.487 --> 25:25.684
Okay, Dad, we have to come up
with a system for unspoken actions.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.315
I can't believe
you called the cops.

25:27.392 --> 25:30.088
I didn't call them, Shawn.
They called me.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.219
Why?

25:31.296 --> 25:32.695
The coroner finished
his inquiry.

25:32.764 --> 25:34.629
Found a bullet
inside the sea lion.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.761
Two. 22 slugs, actually.

25:37.836 --> 25:38.894
He was shot?

25:38.970 --> 25:40.028
He was murdered.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.709
So, am I gonna need a lawyer?
'Cause mine's on a boat.

25:52.918 --> 25:55.682
Off Cape Horn.
It might take a while.

25:56.521 --> 25:59.786
Mister LaBayda, would you remove
that bird from your shoulder?

25:59.858 --> 26:02.827
Oh, this is an
Australian hissing owl.

26:02.894 --> 26:06.330
And I have to do a show with
him in about three hours.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.232
If I haven't bonded with him by then,
he will spend the entire shoot crapping

26:10.302 --> 26:12.293
all over my Ed Hardy tee.

26:12.370 --> 26:16.238
Now, I would appreciate it
if you'd watch your tone.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.969
'Cause this thing
is like a sponge

26:18.043 --> 26:22.412
and he can get really
aggressive when things get tense.

26:23.548 --> 26:24.708
Detective, telephone.

26:24.783 --> 26:27.581
I'm in the middle of
something. It's the FBI.

26:27.652 --> 26:28.676
Again? Would you
tell them

26:28.753 --> 26:31.051
I didn't know they were
smugglers until it was too late?

26:31.122 --> 26:34.023
<i>And tell them if I had access to my own
plane, I could have followed the Rocinante</i>

26:34.092 --> 26:36.253
into the storm! Maybe you
should tell them yourself.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.418
Right.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.927
Didn't I have her fired?

26:47.906 --> 26:50.466
Oh! Is that your source?

26:50.542 --> 26:54.171
No. Mr. LaBayda,
our source is the court,

26:54.245 --> 26:57.043
as in a court-sanctioned
search we did of your office.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.345
We found animal-tracking
software on your computer.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.214
We don't tag
our animals, Randy!

27:01.286 --> 27:03.652
Once they're released
into the wild, they're free.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.382
Perhaps you'd like
to explain.

27:10.261 --> 27:11.455
I need someone
to take the bird.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.425
All right.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.032
We were going to track him.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.867
But it was such a great,
heartwarming local story.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.271
It would have been
a great national one.

27:23.341 --> 27:24.808
I mean you can't
blame me for

27:25.677 --> 27:28.043
wanting the people to
know what happened to this

27:28.713 --> 27:30.704
special creature.

27:30.782 --> 27:35.185
Yeah. Well, we need to know
why you released him miles away

27:35.253 --> 27:37.050
from where you were
supposed to.

27:40.692 --> 27:41.954
I, uh,

27:43.294 --> 27:45.421
think I'd like to
make my phone call now.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.727
Yeah. I bet you would.

27:51.102 --> 27:52.228
LaBayda's Sea Adventure.

27:53.638 --> 27:54.969
Burn the disks.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.095
Is this you, boss?

27:56.908 --> 27:58.375
Destroy the footage.

27:58.443 --> 28:01.810
Take a vacation in Mexico for
at least a week. Can you do that?

28:01.880 --> 28:04.371
<i>I can't get to the footage
right now, Chief. Why not?</i>

28:05.183 --> 28:06.912
Because your two hair analysts
are reviewing it right now.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.386
I don't have
a hair analyst!

28:10.789 --> 28:12.120
<i>Who set that up?</i>

28:12.390 --> 28:13.652
Oh, crap.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.255
<i>Get over there! Now!</i>

28:18.296 --> 28:20.264
Hair analyst?
That worked?

28:20.331 --> 28:21.992
I've always dreamed
of having one myself.

28:22.067 --> 28:26.834
<i>I need the sunset perfectly
framing the silhouette.</i>

28:27.372 --> 28:29.772
<i>It has to be me
and the wild.</i>

28:30.475 --> 28:34.468
<i>Now, let me just say, you see a
single strand of my hair out of place,</i>

28:35.080 --> 28:37.571
<i>let me know. We cut right then and
there. And that includes chest hair.</i>

28:37.949 --> 28:39.177
<i>Tim, you got me?
You got me?</i>

28:39.250 --> 28:40.945
<i>Yeah, I got it.
All right. Here we go.</i>

28:41.019 --> 28:42.680
<i>All right. Three... What?</i>

28:42.754 --> 28:44.346
<i>Freighter, freighter.
What?</i>

28:44.556 --> 28:48.492
<i>No! No! Get out
of the way!</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:51.427
<i>Get your big polluting ass
out of my shot!</i>

28:51.496 --> 28:53.589
<i>How many boats
are there gonna be?</i>

28:55.700 --> 28:57.861
<i>Okay! Perfect.</i>

28:59.003 --> 29:00.766
<i>I guess this'll
just have to do.</i>

29:03.108 --> 29:07.101
<i>I don't like it. I wanna go on
record saying, "I don't like it. "</i>

29:07.746 --> 29:11.773
Gus, he's not a murderer.
He's just an egomaniac.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.543
And for fairly good reason.
His hair is spectacular.

29:14.953 --> 29:17.820
<i>Swim. Swim, my friend.</i>

29:17.956 --> 29:21.016
He released Shabby in the wrong
place to get a better shot!

29:22.026 --> 29:24.460
That means Shabby was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

29:25.063 --> 29:29.557
<i>Arrivederci, my furry
little Michael Phelps.</i>

29:30.135 --> 29:31.466
Arrivederci.

29:31.536 --> 29:34.061
He didn't shoot him.
He didn't do it.

29:35.073 --> 29:39.601
<i>Yeah, pumas are pretty mean. I
know one time I ran into a puma.</i>

29:40.945 --> 29:42.207
<i>Oh, man, I was...</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:46.114
Gus, look at that. That's the
same boat we saw. The same guys!

29:47.285 --> 29:48.843
It was five days ago.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.820
We've been drifting
for about an hour.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.355
We stalled on our way
to Monterey.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.387
They weren't on the way
to Monterey.

29:56.461 --> 29:57.723
They were on their way
to the reef.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.957
The reef where Shabby
went off the grid.

30:00.031 --> 30:01.396
Why would they be going
out there at night?

30:02.767 --> 30:04.860
Guys? Out of there!

30:05.703 --> 30:07.261
Plan "A" or plan "B"?
"B."

30:07.338 --> 30:08.771
Get out of there!

30:12.610 --> 30:14.544
Oh, my God,
I killed him!

30:23.388 --> 30:25.618
Shawn, you can't steal your
dad's boat for a second time.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.818
Gus, you don't understand.
My dad wants me to do this.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.186
Do I, Shawn?

30:37.368 --> 30:39.632
You were really
good with him.

30:39.704 --> 30:43.105
So were you. You really
scared him. And the bird.

30:45.677 --> 30:51.115
Listen. I don't know if this is the
right time to ask, but what about Shawn?

30:51.649 --> 30:53.446
What about him?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.850
I don't know.
Something

30:56.654 --> 30:57.985
intriguing.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.683
You know, odd.
It's refreshing.

31:01.492 --> 31:04.689
I was thinking of letting him
know that I'm, uh, "available. "

31:04.929 --> 31:07.420
You know, and all
that. What do you think?

31:07.799 --> 31:10.996
I don't know.

31:11.069 --> 31:12.161
Is there a problem?

31:12.237 --> 31:14.205
No. No, there's no problem.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.601
Your dad's getting
pretty good.

31:17.675 --> 31:21.577
Too good. I think he's been waiting in
there since Thursday. It's pretty creepy.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.079
And mildly impressive.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.544
Gus. Opportunity.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.529
They're going that way. We
gonna follow them or not?

31:41.599 --> 31:43.658
Uh, I'm definitely a
"not" right now. But...

31:45.937 --> 31:47.131
They might be
coming back.

31:47.272 --> 31:49.638
Walking in the opposite direction.
I think this is our best opportunity.

31:49.707 --> 31:50.696
But they're going
to get help.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.106
They're unloading stuff.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.199
Barnacle Bill.
What...

31:53.278 --> 31:54.267
Shawn!

31:56.948 --> 31:58.381
You wanna be Hawkeye
or Crow's Nest?

31:58.449 --> 31:59.848
What do either
of those mean?

31:59.918 --> 32:01.146
I don't know.
I was hoping you did.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.290
What is all this stuff?

32:07.358 --> 32:11.954
GPS, radar, sonar, electronic
pulse sensors. High-tech stuff.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.695
That's how they knew
we were in the water.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.996
Whatever they were doing,
they didn't want to be found.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.468
And they were
doing it at night.

32:21.539 --> 32:22.801
It's just a bunch
of salvage equipment.

32:23.608 --> 32:24.905
Wait a minute.

32:35.753 --> 32:36.777
We need to get this thing off.

32:44.162 --> 32:45.186
What are we looking for?

32:45.263 --> 32:46.992
This thing! This thing!
This thing!

32:47.065 --> 32:49.124
Here. Let me do it.
I was a Navy scout.

32:51.536 --> 32:52.935
This is a satellite
tracking tag.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.028
What's it for?

32:54.105 --> 32:56.733
They use it for tagging
animals. Training, research.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.673
Well, a couple
of things are odd.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.871
I found a strange
empty piercing.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.010
<i>Why does this
have a GPS on it?</i>

33:03.915 --> 33:05.906
LaBayda was tracking
the sea lion.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.088
He found a bullet
inside the sea lion.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.785
Two. 22 slugs, actually.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.153
They killed him, Shawn.
But why?

33:19.897 --> 33:21.023
We should go.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.866
They're coming. They're gonna
see us! Quick! Jump in the water.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.267
Okay. Hang from the
anchor. Where's the anchor?

33:26.337 --> 33:27.531
That only works
in cartoons.

33:27.605 --> 33:28.594
Is there a shark cage?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.004
How could that
possibly be a good idea?

33:30.074 --> 33:31.769
I don't know! At least I'm
coming up with some ideas!

33:34.212 --> 33:36.976
I'm telling you, I saw the boat
rocking. I swear. It's fine!

33:40.685 --> 33:41.947
There's no one.
Everything's fine.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.214
I saw something.
I'm telling you.

33:44.088 --> 33:47.387
You're paranoid, man. We're in the
home stretch here. Let's go. Get going.

33:47.458 --> 33:50.018
No, I'm not.
I'm checking the pull.

33:50.094 --> 33:53.860
<i>Dude, this is like Out
of Sight, but super gay.</i>

33:53.931 --> 33:55.125
Don't touch me, Shawn.

33:55.199 --> 33:58.066
Wait! Wait! You hear that?

33:58.136 --> 33:59.364
Hear what?

34:01.239 --> 34:03.571
All right. All right.
I'm just nervous, man.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.101
I see a flashlight.

34:15.186 --> 34:17.085
Don't touch me, Shawn.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.795
Wait. What does "Rocinante"
mean to you?

34:27.098 --> 34:29.726
<i>No. It's the name of their airplane.
It flew off into a lightning storm.</i>

34:30.802 --> 34:32.929
Dude! I solved it!
Will you be quiet?

34:33.004 --> 34:34.596
But I solved it!
Be quiet!

34:34.672 --> 34:37.800
Hey! I heard it again.
Didn't you hear that?

34:37.875 --> 34:39.502
What do you hear?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.043
I hear birds!
Listen! Listen!

34:41.112 --> 34:43.978
Untie, push off.
Please. We're going.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.942
I think
that's the engine.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.817
I'm gonna kill you, Shawn.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.652
Okay. I think they're gone.
I'm gonna call for help.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.695
No. He'll hear you.
He has eagle ears.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.355
Eagle ears?
Yes.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.762
How about I send a text?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.801
Mute your keys!
How do I do that?

35:04.669 --> 35:07.433
Come here! Okay, what?
What? What's so important?

35:07.505 --> 35:08.767
I just got a text
from Shawn Spencer.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.775
And what did it say? It says
that he solved the crime, and...

35:11.843 --> 35:13.310
And what?

35:13.411 --> 35:16.778
He's trapped in the hull of a
smuggler's boat going out to sea.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.579
What do we do
with that?

35:19.650 --> 35:21.550
"How can we find... "

35:21.619 --> 35:25.077
Okay, now type the letter "U" instead
Y-O-U, and you don't need that punctuation.

35:25.156 --> 35:26.214
It's just faster.
Chief.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.124
Dude, I really do feel
so Clooney right now.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.695
I am not Jennifer Lopez.

35:32.763 --> 35:33.787
That was a compliment.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.696
How is that
possibly a compliment?

35:36.234 --> 35:39.067
<i>Did you see El Cantante?
She was amazing.</i>

35:39.670 --> 35:40.728
Shawn.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.434
Shabby's
transmitter.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.569
Don't...
Hold on.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.203
Get off me, Shawn.
Get off me.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.269
Got it!

35:54.318 --> 35:56.252
Ooh! Ooh!
I got another text!

35:56.320 --> 35:59.016
What does it say?
"Turn on LaBayda's laptop. "

35:59.090 --> 36:01.115
Uh... Someone get it
out of evidence!

36:01.959 --> 36:05.019
Now
all we do is wait.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.324
Gus, scratch my leg.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.392
Just... Would you just scratch
my leg? I'm not scratching.

36:11.469 --> 36:14.666
The elastic on my sock... I'm
not scratching your leg, Shawn.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.171
Can you give us a general
location of the boat?

36:17.241 --> 36:19.038
Well, it's a little bit problematic.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.204
Well, I have my sister on ready with the
Coast Guard. Just give us the coordinates.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.305
That's the problem. We have
a very definitive location,

36:24.382 --> 36:26.714
it just doesn't seem
to make any sense.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.718
How far out are they?

36:30.655 --> 36:32.452
First Street and Main.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.125
Juliet wants me
to check outside.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.496
You are not doing that.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.161
She says we may not be
where we think we are.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.598
I trust her, Gus.
I'm gonna do it.

36:49.674 --> 36:50.663
Shawn...

36:50.741 --> 36:51.901
Shawn!

36:59.717 --> 37:01.275
Uh, Gus?

37:02.153 --> 37:03.142
Change of plans.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.553
All right, let's do this
quick. I got the diamonds,

37:07.625 --> 37:09.616
we'll lose the equipment
as fast as we can, we'II...

37:12.230 --> 37:13.891
What the hell?

37:13.965 --> 37:17.457
Wait a second.
This is not my boat!

37:18.336 --> 37:22.363
<i>My bad! Gus, I told you, our
boat is called Just Chillin'.</i>

37:22.440 --> 37:24.374
<i>Just Chillin'!
Ah! Yeah!</i>

37:24.575 --> 37:26.236
Inexcusable, huh?

37:26.310 --> 37:27.902
We're sorry, and we'll be on our way.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.412
I'm sorry you
had to be here.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.572
Apology accepted.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.110
Get down.

37:35.119 --> 37:36.711
Down!

37:38.422 --> 37:41.289
Around this way. Come
on. Towards the truck.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.556
Now what the hell's going
on here? All right, guys,

37:44.629 --> 37:47.757
I'm just gonna be honest, 'cause that's
usually the best policy. Right? I'm a psychic.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.390
You're psychic?
Yeah.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.298
So I know you guys weren't
really on your way to Monterey,

37:51.369 --> 37:52.927
and I know you weren't
stranded. In fact,

37:53.004 --> 37:55.472
you were in a desperate search for
the wreckage of the Rocaninante.

37:55.539 --> 37:57.234
That was
nowhere near close.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.299
I really hate
that you said that.

37:59.377 --> 38:01.072
Do we shoot them?
I don't know yet.

38:01.145 --> 38:04.137
You don't know yet? Well, uh,
I'll tell you what else I know.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.184
You found your wreckage from a
plane that everyone assumed escaped,

38:07.251 --> 38:08.878
but actually went down
in restricted waters,

38:08.953 --> 38:10.887
which is why your booty
was so tough to find.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.479
You a cop?
We are not cops.

38:12.556 --> 38:15.548
No, but if I was a cop, I'd
be a bad cop. That much I know.

38:15.626 --> 38:19.027
Not because I'm tough or
unscrupulous. Because of lateness.

38:19.096 --> 38:21.530
Just general tardiness.
Would you stop moving?

38:21.766 --> 38:23.324
Get over here. What's the point of this?

38:23.401 --> 38:26.837
Unfortunately, a sweet
sea lion named Shabby

38:26.904 --> 38:30.465
was innocently looking for
a fish or a squid to eat...

38:30.541 --> 38:32.008
What the hell
is the point of this?

38:32.076 --> 38:33.338
The point is,

38:33.577 --> 38:36.808
<i>you saw the signal coming.
I got a hot signal coming.</i>

38:37.982 --> 38:41.247
What is it, a boat? No. It
could be a diver, though.

38:44.422 --> 38:45.787
<i>You thought
you'd been had, so...</i>

38:46.957 --> 38:49.152
You fired into the water,
thinking it was a diver, but no.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.784
I got it, whatever it was.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.530
A sweet, innocent
sea lion,

38:53.597 --> 38:56.532
attached to a beeper by a
television host on the slide

38:56.600 --> 38:58.329
hoping to exploit his
story for a comeback.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.330
<i>And when you tried to
pull him out of the water,</i>

39:00.404 --> 39:02.065
<i>he managed to break free. Why?</i>

39:02.139 --> 39:06.337
Because he was a winner,
and a very strong swimmer.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.776
And a survivor.
That's right. At least...

39:09.246 --> 39:10.713
At least for a couple
of hours he was.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.043
You're here because
of a sea lion?

39:12.116 --> 39:13.913
I'm here for all the
sea lions, Jack!

39:14.085 --> 39:15.177
And the fish,

39:15.252 --> 39:17.220
and that stuff that looks like
coral but moves when you touch it.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.448
Gus, what am I
talking about?

39:18.522 --> 39:19.819
Sea amanonees.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.456
Don't do this to yourself.
Sea anenomies?

39:23.527 --> 39:25.586
Yes! Yeah, well, it's too
bad you can't do anything

39:25.663 --> 39:27.028
with all that information,
isn't it, now?

39:27.098 --> 39:30.465
Yeah. Except that Shabby left
a little something behind.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.633
And I've been doing something
I like to call stalling.

39:35.873 --> 39:39.639
And Rutger Hauer
calls "shhtalling. "

39:39.710 --> 39:41.940
Why?
Because he's Dutch.

39:42.012 --> 39:43.843
No, why are you stalling?

39:43.914 --> 39:47.441
Because of that. Put
it down! Don't move!

39:47.518 --> 39:48.678
Drop it!

39:48.753 --> 39:49.742
All right.

39:52.923 --> 39:54.481
Saving your ass
again, Spencer?

39:54.825 --> 39:56.918
Lassy, I believe you'll find

39:56.994 --> 39:59.758
that whatever your missing smugglers
had is in that truck over there.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.594
Diamonds?
Perhaps in the boat.

40:02.666 --> 40:04.133
What are you
talking about?

40:04.335 --> 40:06.803
I'm helping you. I told
you. It's a two-way street.

40:07.338 --> 40:08.430
Hold on. How did you...

40:08.506 --> 40:09.734
A little bit of this,

40:09.840 --> 40:12.274
and a whole lot
of that.

40:24.488 --> 40:25.648
Hey!
Hi.

40:25.723 --> 40:28.191
The case is finished,

40:28.292 --> 40:30.692
but I still have to do
a little paperwork.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.921
That's all I'm doing here.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.731
But look at you!
Look at you!

40:34.799 --> 40:39.395
Yeah! First day back. They even
offered me LaBayda's office.

40:40.004 --> 40:41.494
I said no.

40:41.705 --> 40:42.694
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.638
That's the worst decision
anyone's ever made.

40:44.708 --> 40:45.697
Yeah.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.944
Listen, Shawn. Um,
I asked them for you,

40:50.014 --> 40:54.041
but they don't really allow
people to ride dolphins.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.144
But we could arrange an
interaction. That would be easy.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.210
Yeah.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.782
No. No, it's okay.
I'm gonna wait.

41:02.860 --> 41:06.227
Wait until it's natural,
organic, happens in the wild...

41:06.297 --> 41:07.628
Um, that's illegal.

41:07.698 --> 41:09.893
What if I ride a whale?

41:10.201 --> 41:12.931
I mean, what if I do the
same thing, but with a whale?

41:14.205 --> 41:15.729
That's a joke.
Of course it is.

41:15.806 --> 41:18.639
Of course it is.
Okay. Yeah, the, um...

41:18.709 --> 41:22.702
Well, listen. Anything else I can
do, please, you really are amazing.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.078
How about dinner? You and me. Mmm.

41:25.149 --> 41:29.051
Very dark restaurant. I'll bring
some candles, in case it's too dark.

41:29.119 --> 41:30.484
That's something
I like to do.

41:30.554 --> 41:33.785
Listen, Shawn, I, um...

41:34.425 --> 41:35.983
I really would love to.
Sweet.

41:36.460 --> 41:37.484
Uh, but,

41:38.162 --> 41:39.686
I don't want to
get in the way.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.697
Get in the way?
Yeah.

41:42.299 --> 41:45.860
I like her, and I think
you two will get there.

41:47.137 --> 41:48.934
So, thanks for everything.

41:52.142 --> 41:53.973
Uh, what does that
even mean?

41:54.044 --> 41:55.477
Good luck, Shawn.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.894
<i>In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity</i>

42:10.961 --> 42:14.522
<i>I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity</i>

42:14.665 --> 42:17.725
<i>If it's all right
then you're all wrong</i>

42:17.801 --> 42:21.464
<i>But why bounce around
to the same damn song?</i>

42:22.806 --> 42:26.606
<i>You'd rather run
when you can't crawl</i>

42:28.946 --> 42:32.347
<i>I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth</i>

42:32.449 --> 42:35.850
<i>I know, you know
They just don't have any proof</i>

42:35.920 --> 42:38.889
<i>Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend</i>

42:38.956 --> 42:42.915
<i>Your worst inhibitions tend
to psych you out in the end</i>

42:42.993 --> 42:44.790
<i>I know, you know</i>

42:46.463 --> 42:48.192
<i>I know, you know</i>
