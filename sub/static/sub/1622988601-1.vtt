playing)

(gentle melody playing)

00:53.803 --> 00:56.097

01:03.063 --> 01:05.190
TIM:
<i>Time is a funny thing.</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:07.233
<i>-When I was a kid...</i>
-YOUNG TIM: One.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.943
<i>-...the days lasted forever.</i>
-Two.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.320
-Hide, hide, hide!
-Three.

01:10.362 --> 01:11.946
-TIM: <i>But the years...</i>
-Wait! Over here.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.281
<i>-...well, they went by so fast.</i>
-Four.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.158
-Five. Six.
-Tim, no peeking.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.493
TED SR.:
Yeah, no peeking.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.952
-TIM: <i>Before you know it...</i>
-Seven.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.329
<i>-...you're all grown-up.</i>
-Eight.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.289
<i>-It even happened to me.</i>
-Nine.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.291
Nine and a half. Ten!

01:23.333 --> 01:25.502
Ready or not, here I come.
(grunts)

01:25.543 --> 01:27.754
<i>My name's Tim, and this...</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:29.756
<i>well, this is</i>
<i>the rest of my story.</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:31.466
-(roars playfully)
-Run for your lives!

01:31.508 --> 01:33.134
(laughing):
No fair, Dad. You peeked.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.928
(laughter, squealing)

01:34.969 --> 01:37.097
<i>-They call me a stay-at-home</i>
<i>dad, which means...</i>-Let's go!

01:37.138 --> 01:39.140
<i>...I hardly get</i>
<i>to stay at home.</i>

01:39.182 --> 01:41.101
Buckle up, Templetons.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.727
Ready?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.437
-Set.
-Go!

01:44.479 --> 01:46.856
(engine roars, tires squeal)

01:46.898 --> 01:48.358
TIM:
<i>Now, some might say</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:50.610
<i>I still have</i>
<i>an overactive imagination,</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:54.072
<i>but being a dad is</i>
<i>the coolest job in the world.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:55.740
<i>Bunch of cool jobs, really.</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:57.367
(laughing)

01:57.409 --> 01:58.952
<i>Sometimes I'm</i>
<i>a race car driver.</i>

01:58.993 --> 02:01.162
CAROL:
Whoo! Daddy-o Andretti!

02:01.204 --> 02:02.664
TABITHA:
Yay, Templetons!

02:02.706 --> 02:04.290
TIM (Southern accent):
<i>Well, and then sometimes</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:05.875
<i>I'm the best darn cook</i>
<i>in the county</i>

02:05.917 --> 02:07.168
<i>and I deal out every meal.</i>

02:07.210 --> 02:09.421
-Come on, Pa, hit me.
-(burps)

02:09.462 --> 02:11.297
-(chuckles) Tina.
-(Tina laughs)

02:11.339 --> 02:13.550
Whew, doggie!
And the house wins again.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.301
-(thunder crashes)
-CAROL: Yay! -TABITHA: Woo-hoo!

02:15.343 --> 02:17.929
TIM (spooky voice): <i>Or a</i>
<i>surgeon, if need be. (chuckles)</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:19.931
-Spork.
-Spork.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.808
-Spatula.
-Spatula.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.395
Give my creature life!

02:25.437 --> 02:28.189
-(growling)
-(Carol and Tabitha gasp)

02:28.231 --> 02:29.691
She's alive!

02:29.733 --> 02:31.985
TIM: <i>We have our ups,</i>
<i>and we have our downs.</i>

02:32.027 --> 02:33.361
-(whimpers)
-No, no, no. Look. Look.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.654
-Lamb Lamb's okay. See?
-Yay!

02:34.696 --> 02:36.489
TIM:
<i>But we always stick together.</i>

02:36.531 --> 02:38.658
<i>-My wife, Carol.</i>
-It's a miracle!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.618
TIM: <i>She's the</i>
<i>breadwinner of the family.</i>

02:40.660 --> 02:42.537
-(applause) -Thank you.
You know what they say:

02:42.579 --> 02:44.247
-"It's all about the dough."
-(laughter)

02:44.289 --> 02:46.166
And I couldn't have done it
without my husband.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.751
He really rose to the occasion.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.003
-It's the yeast I can do.
-(cheering) -Yeah, Mama!

02:50.045 --> 02:52.213
TIM:
<i>She brings home the bacon, too,</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:54.424
<i>while I keep an eye</i>
<i>on our new baby, Tina.</i>

02:54.466 --> 02:56.426
<i>(chuckles):</i>
<i>But sometimes, feels like</i>

02:56.468 --> 02:58.386
<i>she's keeping an eye on me.</i>

02:58.428 --> 03:00.013
<i>-And Tabitha...</i>
-Thank you!

03:00.055 --> 03:02.182
<i>...our little second-grader</i>
<i>who just got accepted</i>

03:02.223 --> 03:03.808
<i>-into the best school in town.</i>
-(laughter)

03:03.850 --> 03:05.143
Yay, Tabitha!

03:05.185 --> 03:06.644
TIM:
<i>We're so proud.</i>

03:06.686 --> 03:08.313
<i>I still keep in touch</i>
<i>with the old gang, too.</i>

03:08.355 --> 03:09.856
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>Jimbo is mayor now.</i>

03:09.898 --> 03:11.608
-BOTH: Cookie!
<i>-Of course, his wife, Staci,</i>

03:11.649 --> 03:13.443
<i>is the real brains</i>
<i>behind the operation.</i>

03:13.485 --> 03:15.320
-MAN: Yo, Jimbo!
<i>-Now, the Triplets...</i>

03:15.362 --> 03:16.738
-* Busted... *
-* Busted... *

03:16.780 --> 03:18.365
-* Busted. *
-(sirens wailing)

03:18.406 --> 03:20.033
TIM: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>they haven't changed much.</i>

03:20.075 --> 03:21.910
<i>And as for</i>
<i>my baby brother, Ted,</i>

03:21.951 --> 03:24.037
<i>well, he grew up</i>
<i>to be the boss, all right.</i>

03:24.079 --> 03:26.623
<i>-He's so busy we hardly see</i>
<i>him anymore.</i>-(toy squeaking)

03:26.664 --> 03:28.458
-(phone rings)
<i>-But, hey, he always remembers</i>

03:28.500 --> 03:30.919
<i>to send inappropriately</i>
<i>lavish gifts</i>

03:30.960 --> 03:32.712
<i>-on special occasions.</i>
-(Tabitha squeals)

03:32.754 --> 03:35.548
-OMG! Uncle Ted is the best!
-(neighing)

03:35.590 --> 03:37.717
-(clatters)
-(Tim gasps)

03:37.759 --> 03:38.885
(sighs)

03:38.927 --> 03:40.345
TIM:
<i>All in all,</i>

03:40.387 --> 03:42.263
<i>my life is pretty perfect.</i>

03:42.305 --> 03:43.598
(insects trilling,
birds chirping)

03:43.640 --> 03:45.850
<i>But all that</i>
<i>was about to change.</i>

03:45.892 --> 03:47.894
(yelps, gasps)

03:47.936 --> 03:49.145
Good heavens.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.314
I'll save you!

03:51.356 --> 03:53.316
-Ha!
-(Tina screams, laughs)

03:53.358 --> 03:54.901
Thanks, babe.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.319
Stay calm, Tabitha.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.779
I'm coming for you.

03:57.821 --> 04:01.783
I'm gonna save you
from the bubbling lava!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.410
Dad, what are you doing?

04:03.451 --> 04:05.829
Ew, gross. It went everywhere.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.415
Come on, this is
the candy volcano of doom!

04:08.456 --> 04:10.625
You used to love it.
(mimics explosion)

04:10.667 --> 04:12.752
But I'm trying
to do my homework,

04:12.794 --> 04:14.254
or I'm doomed.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.006
Oh.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.216
<i>Because if there's</i>
<i>one thing I've learned,</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:19.926
<i>you're only a kid once.</i>

04:19.968 --> 04:23.304
<i>Once you grow up,</i>
<i>you can never go back.</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:26.266
(babbling)

04:26.307 --> 04:28.518
Ee...!

04:29.602 --> 04:31.312
(grunts)

04:32.939 --> 04:34.983
(gasps) Oh, no.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.737
Good night, Dr. Hawking.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.828
Carbon, boron, beryllium,
lithium, helium, hydrogen.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.913
Nailed it.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.832
Boom shakalaka.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.377
(laughs)

04:54.419 --> 04:56.463
"Carry the four."
(chuckles) Gosh.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.089
-TIM: Hey there, Tabitha.
-(Carol whoops, Tina laughs)

04:58.131 --> 04:59.632
It's <i>The Good Night Show.</i>

04:59.674 --> 05:02.552
Live from your bedroom,
starring Dad and Mom.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.305
-And special guest, baby Tina.
-(laughing)

05:05.347 --> 05:07.474
Good night, little Tina. Mwah!

05:07.515 --> 05:09.267
Come back here, you.
(chuckles)

05:09.309 --> 05:10.852
-Good night, Mom.
-Mwah!

05:10.894 --> 05:12.520
Good night, sweetheart.
Mama's gonna kiss you.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.980
-Mama gonna kiss you.
-(Tim clears throat)

05:14.022 --> 05:15.190
* Good night song *

05:15.231 --> 05:16.691
-* With your dad... *
-What?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.318
What? It's time for
your good-night song.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.028
Oh, no, thanks.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.405
I'm listening to white noise!

05:22.447 --> 05:23.990
Helps me fall asleep!

05:24.032 --> 05:26.159
(mimicking white noise)

05:26.201 --> 05:28.370
Hey, what would you say

05:28.411 --> 05:31.331
to me helping you rehearse
for the holiday pageant?

05:31.373 --> 05:32.791
-(gasps)
-Yes! Right?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.668
I can come to school with you,
and you can get

05:34.709 --> 05:36.336
all your friends together,
and we can rehearse together,

05:36.378 --> 05:38.338
go get some ice cream after.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.423
-My treat.
-No! You can't do that.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.467
Um, liability issues.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.344
It's this whole thing.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.680
Oh. Right, right.
(chuckles)

05:46.721 --> 05:47.931
Right.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.558
Whoa. How about your favorite
bedtime story?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.477
You know, the one about...

05:52.519 --> 05:54.562
Uncle Ted was
a magical talking baby.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.606
There was a rocket
full of puppies,

05:56.648 --> 05:58.608
-and you saved the world.
-(shushing)

05:58.650 --> 06:00.026
It was a good story, wasn't it?

06:00.068 --> 06:04.072
Well, it didn't really make
a lot of sense.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.865
The jokes were good, right?

06:05.907 --> 06:07.325
Mm.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.369
-Okay. Um...
-Dad.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.662
(yawns)

06:10.704 --> 06:13.039
My schedule is brutal tomorrow.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.042
(grunting): Yeah. My schedule's
pretty brutal, too.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
Oh, don't forget Lamb Lamb.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.879
Good night, Lamb Lamb.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.798
(kisses)
Good night, Uncle Ted.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.634
I hope to grow up and be
a success, just like you.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.928
Maybe we'll see you soon.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.934
Good night, Tabitha.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.938
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.607
Uh, okay.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.152
I think it's time
we both grow up.

06:42.193 --> 06:45.530
I look forward to greeting you
at the breakfast table.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.830
Sweet dreams.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.723
Hmm.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.101
* *

07:21.149 --> 07:23.443
Where has the time gone?

07:23.485 --> 07:25.904
WIZZIE:
How should I know? (grunts)

07:25.945 --> 07:28.698
-Wait, wait. I see light.
-(toy train tooting)

07:28.740 --> 07:31.659
You, oh, out of my way.
(yells)

07:31.701 --> 07:33.787
(gasps) At long last.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.498
The sweet breath of freedom.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.749
Wizzie?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.459
You there,
what century is this?

07:39.501 --> 07:41.795
(shudders)
Unhand me, vile ogre!

07:41.836 --> 07:43.380
No, no, no, no.
Wizzie, it's me.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.923
-It's Tim.
-(gasps)

07:44.964 --> 07:46.883
Is it really you?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.551
Come closer.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.512
Let me see your face.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.305
Closer.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.391
Closer still.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.226
Oh, Timothy.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.477
It is you.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.187
Hey! What was that for?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.398
You cast me into
eternal darkness

08:01.439 --> 08:04.317
and wreaked havoc
on my circadian rhythms.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.652
I'm sorry, Wizzie.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.320
Hey, but you look great,
though.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.531
Except for the arm, you mean.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.824
(chuckles)
I didn't even notice.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.242
-You thought it.
-I mean, I noticed it,

08:12.283 --> 08:13.868
'cause I... you obviously
don't have an arm. I-I...

08:13.910 --> 08:15.787
You would never treat
Lamb Lamb this way.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.581
Well, I... I gave her
to my daughter, Tabitha.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.375
You have produced
an heir, Timothy?

08:20.417 --> 08:21.710
Two, actually.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.253
Two? Let the bells ring!

08:23.294 --> 08:24.629
(bells jingling,
alarms blaring)

08:24.671 --> 08:26.297
-No, no, no. Wizzie, stop.
-Yes! Yes!

08:26.339 --> 08:28.174
-Wizzie, shh! Quiet, quiet.
-It's a time for celebration!

08:28.216 --> 08:30.176
No, no, no. It's not
the time for celebration.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.886
-Wizzie, shh. Be quiet.
-What? What is it?

08:31.928 --> 08:33.805
-What is it, Tim?
-I don't know.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.640
-(alarms stop)
-I guess I'm just not feeling

08:35.682 --> 08:37.767
very celebratory right now.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.686
Oh?

08:39.728 --> 08:41.521
Tabitha. (sighs)

08:41.563 --> 08:45.692
Man, Wizzie,
she's growing up so fast.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.736
It's like she doesn't even
need me anymore.

08:47.777 --> 08:51.322
Yes, first, they start
spending less time with you.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.782
TIM:
Mm.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.993
Then they stop coming
to you for advice.

08:55.035 --> 08:55.994
Exactly.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.121
Soon, they take you
for granted.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.539
I guess.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.499
-Then break your arm.
-What?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.084
Then stuff you into a box!

09:03.126 --> 09:05.045
Okay. Wizzie, you're...
you're not helping.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.338
(Wizzie scoffs)

09:06.379 --> 09:07.714
Okay, I'm just... I'm afraid

09:07.756 --> 09:09.799
Tabitha and I
are growing apart,

09:09.841 --> 09:12.886
like... like I did
with my brother.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.596
Oh.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.682
I thought we had
all the time in the world.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.393
But you can't
turn back time, can you?

09:20.435 --> 09:23.021
How dare you question my power!

09:23.063 --> 09:26.441
-Turn back. Turn back.
-Oh, here we go.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.069
-Oh, great wheel of li...
-Wait. (shushes)

09:29.110 --> 09:30.904
-(Wizzie snoring)
-Did you hear that?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.907
(gasps)
Never abuse the snooze button!

09:33.948 --> 09:35.992
(shushes) It sounds like it's
coming from the baby's room.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.994
What is it?
A creature of the night?

09:38.036 --> 09:41.081
Witches? Is it the baying
of the hounds of hell?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.415
Wizzie!

09:42.457 --> 09:43.583
Don't go, Tim!

09:43.625 --> 09:45.168
I can turn back time--

09:45.210 --> 09:48.755
to the golden years,
when it was just you and me.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.423
My good arm.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.175
Don't open the door.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.094
(fading in distance):
Remember last time!

09:54.135 --> 09:56.638
(muffled voice
speaking indistinctly)

09:57.806 --> 09:59.808
AUTOMATED VOICE: If you would
like to make a call,

09:59.849 --> 10:01.309
please hang up and try again.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.480
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.273
Thank you.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.441
(whispers):
Hello?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.026
If you would like
to make a call,

10:10.068 --> 10:12.696
-please hang up and try again.
-Ah. Just my phone.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.823
Get it together, man.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.158
Oh, Tina, you little klepto...

10:17.200 --> 10:19.244
Nighty night.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.453
...maniac!

10:20.495 --> 10:22.956
(rapid babbling)

10:22.997 --> 10:24.124
Whoa!

10:24.165 --> 10:26.876
Hi, Daddy.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.962
T-Tabitha? Is that you?

10:29.004 --> 10:30.213
(laughing)

10:30.255 --> 10:31.631
(gasps)

10:31.673 --> 10:33.675
(laughing):
You should've seen your face.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.552
Oh, it's priceless.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.053
You're... You... You-you...

10:37.095 --> 10:39.472
(mock gasping)

10:39.514 --> 10:40.974
You-you can talk?

10:41.016 --> 10:43.143
Yep.
I'm in the family business.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.812
(whispers):
It's a clip-on tie. (shushes)

10:45.854 --> 10:48.106
You see, Daddy,
BabyCorp is more of what I...

10:48.148 --> 10:49.774
Oops.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.152
Daddy, Daddy, come in.
Can you hear me?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.778
-Daddy, do you read me?
-(Tim groaning)

10:53.820 --> 10:55.488
Daddy, how many fingers
am I holding up?

10:55.530 --> 10:56.698
Thursday?

10:56.740 --> 10:57.991
I should've given you
a warning.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.534
I forgot you were an old man.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.036
(yells, spits)

11:01.077 --> 11:02.037
Wait, wait.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.913
-You're from BabyCorp?
-Yes.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.915
BabyCorp is more of what I call

11:05.957 --> 11:07.751
-a side hustle for me.
-Uh-huh.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.836
The point is I'm all in
on the Templetons.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.338
-Go, Templetons!
-Oh! Okay.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.173
You guys really know
how to baby a baby.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.758
-I mean, it's incredible.
-Oh, oh. (chuckles)

11:14.799 --> 11:16.343
Not that's it's all five-star.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.345
-I have to say, you got
a lot of issues. -Sure. Yeah.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.554
We'll talk about that later.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.972
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe this.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.141
Hey, want to go scare
the crap out of Mom?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.101
-Daddy, please stay focused.
-(chuckles) Oh.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.644
(grunts)
Right, right, right.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.355
There's a crisis at BabyCorp.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.481
What is it this time?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.523
(gasps) Kittens?

11:30.565 --> 11:32.650
No. This time, it's even worse.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.902
-Worse than kittens?
-Yes.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.695
That's why I volunteered for

11:35.737 --> 11:37.572
-this supersecret assignment.
-TOY: Mommy.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.491
Ooh, I want to help.
What-what do you want me to do?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.034
That's the spirit, Daddy.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.870
-You are exactly who I need.
-Yes!

11:43.912 --> 11:45.663
To get Uncle Ted.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.374
No. What?

11:47.415 --> 11:48.875
What-What's with the face?

11:48.917 --> 11:51.378
Daddy, BabyCorp can't wait
any longer.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.671
All the pressure's on me, Pop.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.881
When I volunteered
for this gig,

11:54.923 --> 11:56.800
I thought it would be easy.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.385
But you two never
see each other.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.969
It's so sad.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.180
It's like, "F-minus.
See me after class."

12:02.222 --> 12:03.390
(gargles)

12:03.431 --> 12:04.724
Sad? Uh, yeah, maybe.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.934
A little. I don't know.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.352
Did you forget to call him?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.270
I noticed you can be
a little absentminded.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.647
Sorry, what?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.399
It's just that you tend
to procrastinate.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.567
-You have to get him here for
the holidays. -(line ringing)

12:14.609 --> 12:15.860
-No, I'm not...
-(ringing stops)

12:15.902 --> 12:17.278
No, I'm not
gonna call him right now.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.738
-Daddy, can't never could.
-No. -(line ringing)

12:18.780 --> 12:20.115
Did you two have
a fight or something?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.908
-No.
-But you're mad at him?

12:21.950 --> 12:24.202
-Stop that. It's complicated.
-(ringing stops)

12:24.244 --> 12:26.329
-Why? Do you need help using
your phone? -(line ringing)

12:26.371 --> 12:28.081
-No, I don't need help
using my... -(ringing stops)

12:28.123 --> 12:29.624
-Okay. What's the problem?
-(sighs) -(line ringing)

12:29.666 --> 12:31.126
What's the issue?
Talk to me.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.877
-There's no point, okay?
-(ringing stops)

12:32.919 --> 12:34.921
I call him. I invite him.
He never shows up.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.923
He's always got a work meeting
or a business trip

12:36.965 --> 12:38.591
or a conference call.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.468
All he cares about is work.

12:40.510 --> 12:44.431
But after a while, you...
you just stop trying.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.641
-He's still your brother.
-(line ringing)

12:46.683 --> 12:48.935
You were partners.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.687
-Yeah, I guess sometimes
you just... -(ringing stops)

12:50.729 --> 12:54.816
you grow up and grow apart.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.902
-(line ringing)
-(gasps)

12:57.944 --> 12:59.571
Daddy, don't say no.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.989
What if everybody said no?

13:01.031 --> 13:02.157
Nothing would happen.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.575
Nothing would get
off the ground.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.909
You got to wake up every day

13:04.951 --> 13:06.703
and you got to say,
"Yes, yes, yes!"

13:06.745 --> 13:10.123
Surprise me. Say yes.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.291
(sighs)

13:11.332 --> 13:12.167
(ringing stops)

13:12.208 --> 13:14.794
This is really disappointing.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.088
-And now I'm getting mad!
-It's late.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.174
We can work on this
tomorrow, okay?

13:19.215 --> 13:20.884
-(grunts)
-(toy squeaks)

13:20.925 --> 13:23.803
Oh. Whoopsie.
Your little horsey fell off.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.348
Another day won't hurt, right?

13:27.349 --> 13:28.850
Good night, sweetie.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.602
-(door closes)
-(scoffs)

13:31.936 --> 13:33.188
(tape rewinding)

13:33.229 --> 13:34.647
TIM (recorded):
Good night, sweetie.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.483
-...horsey fell off.
-(rewinding)

13:36.524 --> 13:38.151
Tabitha?

13:41.363 --> 13:43.406
* *

13:50.872 --> 13:52.999
(low rumbling,
objects rattling)

13:55.335 --> 13:56.503
Huh?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.380
(gasps, squeals)

14:12.394 --> 14:14.437
* *

14:25.824 --> 14:27.409
Uh, don't worry. I got it.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.285
-(Tim yells, groans)
-Where is she? Where is she?

14:29.327 --> 14:31.037
-Where's who? What?
-I came as fast as I could.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.580
-Ted?
-I canceled all my meetings.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.541
What are you doing here?
(grunts) Why are you yelling?

14:34.582 --> 14:35.792
-Where's Tabitha?
-Tabitha?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.210
-Where is she, Tim?
-CAROL: Ted.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.878
Uncle Ted, you're here!
You're really here.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.463
-Which arm is it?
Left or right? -Huh?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.382
-Is it your fibula? Talk to me.
-Whoa.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.050
-Good dilation. Open up.
-(groans)

14:44.092 --> 14:45.969
-Say, "Ah." Are you okay?
-Wh-What are you doing?

14:46.011 --> 14:47.262
-You look okay.
-Whoa.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.055
Don't worry.
I'm fine, Uncle Ted.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.391
-That's my girl.
-Woo-hoo.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.018
Uh, wh-what brings you
into town?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.394
Well, Tabitha fell
off her pony.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.229
-She did?
-She did?

14:56.271 --> 14:57.230
I did?

14:57.272 --> 14:59.399
-Tim left me a voice mail.
-He did?

14:59.441 --> 15:00.942
-I did?
-You did.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.861
TIM (cobbled from recording):
Hello. This is your brother.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.571
Help. Tabitha fell off horsey.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.822
Good night, sweetie.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.490
Well, that was unsettling.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.077
I swear I didn't
leave that message.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.164
-(coos)
-On... purpose.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.290
I...

15:15.331 --> 15:16.291
Butt-dialed?

15:16.332 --> 15:17.792
(chuckles)
With my butt.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.169
While I was talking
in my sleep.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.754
I do that sometimes.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.380
You sleep-butt-dialed me?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.467
-With my butt.
-(Carol chuckling)

15:25.508 --> 15:28.887
I knew there must be a
perfectly logical explanation.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.680
(chuckles)
And there it is.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.599
-TED: Hmm. -All that matters
is that you're here.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.809
-TABITHA: Woo-hoo! Yay!
-(Tina squeals)

15:34.851 --> 15:36.269
-Absolutely. Uh, for now.
-(Tina giggling)

15:36.311 --> 15:38.271
Uncle Ted, please stay
for Christmas. Please.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.940
Sorry, sweetie. I can't
do Christmas on the 25th.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.193
But, Uncle Ted,
I missed you so much.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.944
<i>(echoing):</i>
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

15:44.986 --> 15:46.613
<i>-I missed you so much.</i>
-Mm... wah!

15:46.654 --> 15:48.573
TABITHA: <i>Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

15:48.615 --> 15:50.283
<i>(echoing): Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

15:50.325 --> 15:51.951
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

15:51.993 --> 15:53.995
(chuckles) Can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

15:54.829 --> 15:56.373
Alone.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.377
-TED: The baby, Tim?
-(shushes)

16:00.418 --> 16:03.046
She's been sent from up there.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.715
-Upstairs?
-That's right. BabyCorp.

16:05.757 --> 16:09.260
So you're saying the voice mail
was some kind of call for help.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.262
Yes! No.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.182
She comes from a secret
corporation run by babies.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.144
Tim, I'm gonna give you
the name of a doctor.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.981
Roy Federman. Just tell him
I sent you, okay?

16:22.023 --> 16:23.233
(hushed):
What are they saying?

16:23.274 --> 16:24.734
We should give them
some privacy.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.027
-Here you go.
-Ooh. Thanks.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.362
TIM:
I'm not crazy!

16:27.404 --> 16:29.114
You just don't remember.
Tell him, Tina.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.448
-He... I...
-TED: She can't talk, Tim.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.158
-TIM: Stop interrupting.
-(Tina groans)

16:32.200 --> 16:33.493
TED: Interrupting what?
I don't hear anything.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.662
Except your obnoxious voice.
You hear that.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.831
I have a beautiful voice.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.249
-(groans)
-TIM: Fine.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.126
I can prove that
everything I'm saying is real.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.502
-TED: Oh, yeah?
-TIM: Yeah!

16:42.544 --> 16:43.503
Suck it, Ted.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.546
I beg your pardon?

16:44.587 --> 16:45.672
You, suck.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.132
No, no, Tim. You suck.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.508
CAROL: Time to go buy
a Christmas tree.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.218
But we already have
a Christmas tree.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.429
-No, we don't. No, we don't.
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.014
Suck it, suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it, suck it.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.557
-Get that pacie out of my face!
-Excuse me.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.685
I hate to interrupt,
but may I make a suggestion?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.061
Why don't you both suck it?

17:00.103 --> 17:02.022
-Ha! (whoops)
-(grunts)

17:02.063 --> 17:03.815
(grunting)

17:03.857 --> 17:05.817
-She can talk.
-A lot.

17:05.859 --> 17:06.985
(whoops)

17:07.027 --> 17:08.611
Buckle up, boys.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.238
(sucking rapidly)

17:11.072 --> 17:12.532
(all screaming)

17:12.574 --> 17:14.868
-TINA: Baby on board!
-(Tim whooping)

17:14.909 --> 17:17.078
-That's what I'm talking about!
-(laughs) Woo-hoo!

17:17.120 --> 17:19.497
(screaming)

17:20.874 --> 17:22.042
(sighs)

17:22.083 --> 17:24.586
* *

17:31.885 --> 17:33.595
TIM:
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

17:34.763 --> 17:36.056
(both grunt)

17:36.097 --> 17:37.724
(yelps)

17:37.766 --> 17:39.768
-Wow.
-(Tina laughs)

17:39.809 --> 17:41.394
(gasps)

17:41.436 --> 17:42.729
I'm home.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.022
TIM:
Yeah. See?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.482
It's all real.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.566
TED:
Whoa.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.735
Is that me?

17:48.777 --> 17:51.488
TINA: If you're fishing for
a compliment, you caught one!

17:51.529 --> 17:53.907
You are a legend in this joint.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.408
A statue?

17:55.450 --> 17:57.952
Well, I did single-handedly
save the company.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.496
Double-handedly.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.914
(chuckling):
Right? We were partners.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.040
Really?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.750
I don't see your statue.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.377
I still love you, Daddy.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.379
TIM:
They got the head size right.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.672
(ding)

18:08.713 --> 18:10.924
TED: Take it from me,
you have to be aggressive

18:10.965 --> 18:12.217
if you want to get ahead.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.927
Climb that corporate ladder

18:13.968 --> 18:16.596
-until you're the last baby
standing at the top. -TIM: Wow.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.557
Actually, I prioritize
a good work-life balance

18:19.599 --> 18:23.103
and a positive environment
where my ideas are valued.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.271
(laughing)

18:25.313 --> 18:26.648
Oh, you're serious.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.525
You're funny, Uncle Ted.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.777
I wonder why they didn't
mention that in your file.

18:30.819 --> 18:31.945
My file?

18:31.986 --> 18:33.488
-You saw my file?
-(Tim sighs)

18:33.530 --> 18:34.781
-Yep.
-What does it say?

18:34.823 --> 18:36.116
It says a lot.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.535
-This is the Crisis Center.
-Whoa. Wow.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.037
This is where we monitor
all threats

18:41.079 --> 18:43.039
to babies around the world.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.332
And Hawaii.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.126
This is so cool.
This is so cool.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.128
(roaring):
I'm Godzilla.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.671
"Oh, run for your lives!
Run for your lives!"

18:49.713 --> 18:52.048
-Why did we bring him?
-Daddy, get down from there.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.801
-Aw. -We can play on it later
when no one is looking.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.511
-What's the crisis?
-Yeah.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.138
Here we go.
What's the crisis, sweetie?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.556
Rusty, roll it.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.474
(snores, whines)

19:01.516 --> 19:03.476
He's new.

19:03.518 --> 19:07.313
DR. ARMSTRONG (over speakers):
Just imagine, baby surgeons.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.649
-(buzzer sounds) -Uh-oh.
-(babies giggling)

19:09.691 --> 19:11.985
Or baby astronauts.

19:12.027 --> 19:15.155
(singsongy):
Floaty, floaty, float.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.491
Yes, babies are gonna
run the world one day.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.745
And that day is coming
sooner than you think.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.748
Hello. My name is
Dr. Erwin Armstrong,

19:24.789 --> 19:27.334
founder of The Acorn Center
for Advanced Childhood.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.294
Wait a minute, that's...
that's Tabitha's school.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.671
Here at the center,
we believe babies

19:31.713 --> 19:34.299
are the ultimate
learning machines.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.259
Isn't that right,
little Nathan?

19:36.301 --> 19:38.428
-Yeah!
-(chuckles): Okay.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.013
They should use
their precious time

19:40.055 --> 19:42.474
to develop faster, push harder.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.892
-Hmm. -(Tim scoffs)
-Parents, they have the best

19:43.933 --> 19:46.853
intentions, of course,
but they're not experts.

19:46.895 --> 19:50.982
After all, the only thing
holding your child back is...

19:51.024 --> 19:52.776
-you.
-KIDS: You!

19:52.817 --> 19:55.487
This explains why Tabitha's
been pulling away from me.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.405
-It's the school.
-ARMSTRONG: Everybody, wave.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.990
-Bye, Mommy.
-KIDS: Bye, Mommy!

19:59.032 --> 20:00.241
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, Daddy!

20:00.283 --> 20:02.869
(singsongy):
Sayonara.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.954
Now, in the past six months,

20:04.996 --> 20:07.957
these schools have been
popping up all over the world.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.209
Uh, so what's the problem?

20:09.250 --> 20:10.877
The school is the problem.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.337
Yeah. School is evil.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.547
No, Daddy,
not all schools are evil.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.675
-It's just this one, okay?
-Okay.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.802
If Armstrong's philosophy
keeps spreading,

20:18.843 --> 20:20.970
it could be
the end of childhood.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.430
No.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.766
Childhood was the worst
three years of my life.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.351
That's so sad.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.228
You probably just
didn't do it right.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.521
-Huh?
-Aw.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.773
But luckily, you get a do-over.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.983
A second chance.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.655
BabyCorp has developed
a new super-duper baby formula

20:38.697 --> 20:41.574
-that can turn a grown-up
back into a baby. -(baby coos)

20:41.616 --> 20:43.910
We have it in cherry, grape,
orange and lime.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.704
-For real?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.664
-You want me to be a baby?
-Hey, it's what you do best.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.791
So you can infiltrate
the school and find out

20:49.833 --> 20:52.502
what Dr. Armstrong
is really up to.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.088
BabyCorp will
take care of the rest.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.923
(whoops)

20:56.965 --> 20:58.591
(Tim gasps, laughs)

20:58.633 --> 21:00.593
It's the perfect disguise.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.555
And it only lasts
48 teensy-weensy hours.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.348
Oh, I am in on the mission.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.516
-Sorry, Pops.
-Ow.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.393
-It's not your mission.
-Aw.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.437
"Warning:
may cause drooling, babbling,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.272
"emotional outbursts,
fits of laughter,

21:12.313 --> 21:16.276
loss of bowel control,
chubby thighs"?

21:16.317 --> 21:19.112
I think some guys at my gym
take this stuff.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.238
(screams)

21:20.280 --> 21:22.032
My texting hand!

21:22.073 --> 21:24.367
-Even though it is your
daughter's school. -(screaming)

21:24.409 --> 21:25.869
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

21:25.910 --> 21:27.370
Daddy, no. Please stop.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.788
(glugs) Whoa!

21:28.830 --> 21:30.498
(babbling rapidly)

21:30.540 --> 21:32.417
What? It actually works.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.626
(Ted straining)

21:33.668 --> 21:35.462
-TED: It's mine!
-(yells)

21:35.503 --> 21:37.297
-I'm better with
this kind of thing! -Oh!

21:37.339 --> 21:38.840
(glugs, screams)

21:38.882 --> 21:41.134
And what kind of thing is that,
Flock of Seagulls?

21:41.176 --> 21:42.969
-(both grunting)
-(record scratches)

21:43.011 --> 21:45.263
("The Time Warp" from <i>Rocky</i>
<i>Horror Picture Show</i>playing)

21:45.305 --> 21:46.806
-Everything!
-Gotcha!

21:46.848 --> 21:49.642
You might feel very emotional,
have some mood swings.

21:49.684 --> 21:50.935
-(glugging)
-(Ted yells)

21:50.977 --> 21:52.187
Oh! (babbles)

21:52.228 --> 21:53.730
Hey! (screams)

21:53.772 --> 21:56.024
Ouch.
There's the awkward stage.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.650
Now, the tea's hot, Connie.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.652
You always have to be
the hero, don't you?

21:59.694 --> 22:01.571
What's that supposed to mean?
(grunts)

22:01.613 --> 22:03.823
Never see him...
(frightened whimpering)

22:03.865 --> 22:05.825
All of a sudden,
he shows up with a pony.

22:05.867 --> 22:09.079
(screams) You're just jealous,
helmet head.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.497
She's my daughter!

22:10.538 --> 22:12.165
She's my niece. (screams)

22:12.207 --> 22:14.167
-(grunts)
-Do you want cream or sugar?

22:14.209 --> 22:15.710
(both yelling)

22:15.752 --> 22:17.712
I was always
the successful one.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.340
Mommy says no running
in the house.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.591
(slurps) Mm.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.843
Hand over the bottle, mullet.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.637
(grunting)

22:25.679 --> 22:28.014
-(screams)
-You can't hug money, you know.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.307
(glugs, babbles)

22:29.349 --> 22:30.725
(grunts)

22:31.685 --> 22:34.145
But you can, Tim. You can.

22:34.187 --> 22:37.148
(both yelling)

22:37.190 --> 22:39.067
Men. Am I right?

22:39.109 --> 22:42.112
(both yelling, grunting)

22:42.153 --> 22:44.030
(glugging)

22:44.072 --> 22:46.116
(slow-motion yelling)

22:46.157 --> 22:48.243
(screams, grunts)

22:48.284 --> 22:49.953
It's not personal.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.788
It's business, Leslie.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.872
(grunts)

22:52.914 --> 22:54.916
Well, it's personal
to me, Lindsey.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.585
(both scream)

22:57.627 --> 23:01.006
(both whimpering)

23:01.047 --> 23:02.882
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Ow, ow, ow!

23:02.924 --> 23:04.759
I'm sorry, Connie.
I have to cut this short.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.886
Tomorrow, we'll talk
about your problems.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.639
Okay, time-out!
This has gone far enough!

23:09.681 --> 23:11.224
TABITHA:
Hey. We're home.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.767
(grunts)
And we got another tree.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.019
A real one.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.061
(all gasp)

23:15.103 --> 23:16.479
Um, upstairs now.

23:16.521 --> 23:17.897
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.357
-(both grunting)
-CAROL: Push it. No, no, pull.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.483
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-Push it up.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.068
-(grunts, whoops)
-Pull. No, okay.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.154
-To the right.
-How come I have the heavy end?

23:24.195 --> 23:26.072
CAROL: Because you're young
and strong, honey.

23:26.114 --> 23:27.449
Little bit more.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.616
-Me first!
-(grunts)

23:28.658 --> 23:29.909
-CAROL: Come on.
-Get off.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.745
-Tim? Ted?
-Mom.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.121
Get the cord. Get the cord.

23:33.163 --> 23:34.414
Get the cord,
get the cord, get the cord!

23:34.456 --> 23:36.124
You just can't disappear.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.459
You need a cover story.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.960
-TED: Ow!
-Oh, right.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.086
My soft spot.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.254
CAROL:
Where are you guys?

23:41.296 --> 23:42.464
Uh, uh, tell her
you're packing.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.300
We're upstairs, uh, packing.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.760
-Packing? For what?
-(Tabitha yells)

23:46.801 --> 23:48.511
Ooh. You're going on
a brother bonding trip.

23:48.553 --> 23:51.097
-We're going on
a brother bonding trip. -Ow!

23:51.139 --> 23:52.724
Now?

23:52.766 --> 23:54.392
But, Tim, your parents
are coming tomorrow.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.102
They can help out.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.979
Yeah, they could help out.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.899
What... No, you can't leave me
alone with your parents.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.567
-(Tina yells, laughs)
-Oh, Tina!

24:02.609 --> 24:05.236
(grunts)
What are you doing?

24:05.278 --> 24:06.738
(both grunting)

24:06.780 --> 24:08.948
All right, you know what?
You're going to baby jail.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.784
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! -Tabitha!

24:10.825 --> 24:12.285
-CAROL: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
-TABITHA: A little help here.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.745
CAROL:
Honey, hold it up. Hold it up.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.455
(deep voice):
This is Ted Templeton, a man.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.165
You can go ahead and take off.
I have urgent family business.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.376
-CAROL: To the right, honey.
-Yes, I have a family.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.294
-Tim, I'm coming up there.
-(Tina gasps)

24:21.336 --> 24:23.254
Yeah, we need to talk.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.923
TABITHA:
Hey, Mom?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.132
Oh! Tina!

24:26.174 --> 24:27.550
(squeals, laughs)

24:27.592 --> 24:29.594
Put that down.
Put that down. Put that down.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.970
-Put that down. Put that down.
-Tina!

24:31.012 --> 24:33.807
-Put that down! Get back here!
-(laughing)

24:33.848 --> 24:36.309
Tina, stop! (grunting)

24:36.351 --> 24:38.436
CAROL:
What has gotten into you?

24:38.478 --> 24:40.146
-Time for us to go!
-(grunts)

24:40.188 --> 24:41.648
-What? Now?
-TED: Yeah.

24:41.690 --> 24:44.526
-My helicopter's double-parked.
-Bye!

24:44.567 --> 24:46.695
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So soon? -Oh, no.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.822
-(both scream)
-(wind whistling)

24:48.863 --> 24:51.700
-(helicopter whirring)
-(panting)

24:53.118 --> 24:54.869
What... Did they really
just leave?

24:54.911 --> 24:55.995
Yep.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.872
-Hide!
-(Ted and Tim whimpering)

24:57.914 --> 25:00.917
(groans)
I got to lose this baby fat.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.544
(Carol sighs)

25:02.585 --> 25:04.671
Tina! What is your problem?

25:04.713 --> 25:06.840
(Tina laughing)

25:06.881 --> 25:08.925
* *

25:10.677 --> 25:12.429
CAROL: Now, you're gonna
wake up tomorrow

25:12.470 --> 25:14.055
and be good, Tina.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.390
No more devil baby.

25:15.432 --> 25:16.683
Deal?

25:16.725 --> 25:19.019
-(coos)
-Okay.

25:21.146 --> 25:23.064
(both gasping for air)

25:23.106 --> 25:24.232
(both scream)

25:24.274 --> 25:25.483
Ew.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.943
(both scream)

25:26.985 --> 25:29.195
-(chiming) -Thanks so much
for coming in, ladies.

25:29.237 --> 25:30.530
Would you like some fruit?

25:30.572 --> 25:31.573
Mm. Ow!

25:31.614 --> 25:32.574
What was... Hey!

25:32.615 --> 25:34.159
Uh, can we get on with this?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.369
(grunts, groans)

25:36.411 --> 25:38.038
I miss my teeth.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.081
I've decided who's going
on the mission.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.332
Thank you. I accept.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.417
Both of you.

25:42.459 --> 25:43.960
-Yes!
-No.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.712
BabyCorp wants to get
the team back together, huh?

25:45.754 --> 25:46.838
(laughs):
No.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.214
They think that's
a terrible idea.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.382
Of course they do.

25:49.424 --> 25:51.217
Well, I'm the boss, applesauce.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.220
And I think you two are better
together than you are apart.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.515
Well, I work alone--
or at least not with him.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.559
Hey. There's no "I" in "team."

25:59.601 --> 26:01.561
Actually, there's no "U"
in "team," either,

26:01.603 --> 26:03.772
-but there is an "M-E."
-T-E-A-M...

26:03.813 --> 26:05.732
But teamwork doesn't seem work.

26:05.774 --> 26:08.109
Ah. If you want something
done right, do it yourself.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.653
-We're all in it together.
-Every man for himself.

26:10.695 --> 26:12.405
One is the loneliest number.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.282
-The ayes have it.
-We the people!

26:14.324 --> 26:16.159
Aha!

26:17.452 --> 26:18.745
Oh. So sorry.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.163
(whispers):
Okay. Good night.

26:20.205 --> 26:21.581
Whew.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.708
Guess we'll just have to
melt down your big old statue

26:23.750 --> 26:25.585
and turn it into
participation trophies.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.420
Please, no,
don't hurt my statue.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.507
Now, we have secret intel

26:30.548 --> 26:35.637
that Dr. Armstrong leaves his
office every morning at 11:15.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.138
You need to sneak in there,

26:37.180 --> 26:39.391
plant these
surveillance devices,

26:39.432 --> 26:41.434
and report back to me.

26:41.476 --> 26:42.560
Oh, man, this is so cool.

26:42.602 --> 26:43.728
(echoing over speaker):
Testing.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.105
* Strangers in the night... *

26:45.146 --> 26:47.607
Now, I've arranged
for a school bus

26:47.649 --> 26:49.943
to be here at 8:00 a.m. sharp!

26:49.984 --> 26:51.569
-Thank you, Connie.
-CONNIE: Nighty night.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.071
Do not be late.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.322
Got it.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.282
Easy-breezy, taco-peasy, boys.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.159
Let's get some sleep!

26:58.201 --> 27:00.120
(snoring)

27:04.290 --> 27:06.334
(coos softly)

27:08.461 --> 27:10.714
* *

27:20.015 --> 27:22.183
CAROL:
Hey, what's the matter?

27:23.685 --> 27:24.936
TABITHA:
It's nothing.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.312
CAROL:
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.647
I'm sure your dad will be back

27:27.689 --> 27:29.315
in time to see you
in the pageant.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.692
TABITHA:
That's okay.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.068
CAROL: What?
Don't you want him to come?

27:32.110 --> 27:34.654
-TABITHA: I guess.
-CAROL: Of course you do.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.614
Now, go back to sleep.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.033
TABITHA:
Good night, Mom.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.368
CAROL:
Good night, sweetie.

27:47.876 --> 27:49.919
(coos softly)

27:53.465 --> 27:55.717
* *

27:59.721 --> 28:01.181
CAROL:
<i>Don't you want him to come?</i>

28:01.222 --> 28:03.099
-TABITHA: <i>I guess.</i>
-(gasping)

28:03.141 --> 28:04.392
(screams)

28:04.434 --> 28:06.770
Don't you think I'm
a little old for that now?

28:06.811 --> 28:09.522
I think it's time
we both grow up.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.107
-(grunts)
-(thunder crashes)

28:11.149 --> 28:12.901
(gavel slamming)

28:14.069 --> 28:16.613
The trial of
Timothy Leslie Templeton

28:16.654 --> 28:18.031
is now in session.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.407
-Ha! Leslie.
-(laughter)

28:19.449 --> 28:21.534
Trial? Wait, what...
what are the charges?

28:21.576 --> 28:22.869
Fraud.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.538
Claiming to be
the world's best dad.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.998
-But I never said...
-Exhibit A.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.209
-Oh, come on. That was a gift.
-(gallery gasping)

28:29.250 --> 28:32.253
I suggest you let
your attorney do the talking.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.422
(gasps) Oh, no.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.966
Back in my day, you had to
earn one of these babies.

28:37.008 --> 28:38.259
-Dad, what? I did not...
-(gallery gasping)

28:38.301 --> 28:41.054
His best friend was
an alarm clock.

28:41.096 --> 28:41.846
Mom.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.516
(groans) He broke my arm.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.059
No, I didn't!
It was my brother.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.227
Objection, Your Honor.

28:47.268 --> 28:48.687
Sustained.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.313
We the jury find
the defendant...

28:50.355 --> 28:51.815
ALL:
A failure!

28:51.856 --> 28:53.608
Tabitha, will you please
help me out?

28:53.650 --> 28:54.984
Whoa!

28:55.026 --> 28:57.404
Dad, the homework,
it's just too much.

28:57.445 --> 28:58.571
-Whoa!
-Tabitha!

28:58.613 --> 28:59.781
-Time's up.
-(alarm ringing)

28:59.823 --> 29:02.367
-Wait. No!
-Save me, Daddy! Save me!

29:02.409 --> 29:04.619
(screaming)

29:04.661 --> 29:06.204
(yells, gasps)

29:06.246 --> 29:07.747
(sighs)

29:07.789 --> 29:10.750
-Oh, man. That was crazy.
-(snoring)

29:10.792 --> 29:12.627
(both yelling)

29:12.669 --> 29:14.170
-We overslept! We overslept?
-(gasping)

29:14.212 --> 29:15.880
-We overslept.
-Wake up, little halflings!

29:15.922 --> 29:18.049
-Wake up! What year is it?
-(alarm ringing)

29:18.800 --> 29:20.844
Oh, no.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.595
This is bad. No.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.264
No! No.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.598
(yells) Get up.

29:25.640 --> 29:26.933
Get up. We got to go.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.810
Come on.
We're gonna be late for... Oh!

29:28.852 --> 29:30.103
I'm gonna email it to you.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.604
(grunts) What's going on?

29:31.646 --> 29:33.898
Ah, I forgot to set Wizzie
for daylight savings!

29:33.940 --> 29:36.943
-What?!
-Daylight can't be saved, Tim.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.237
Oh, I got to get the plant
and the bug we got to plant.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.114
-Grab whatever. We got to go.
-Don't panic. Do not panic.

29:41.156 --> 29:42.657
-Ow. (groans)
-Godspeed, boys.

29:42.699 --> 29:43.783
Let's roll.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.286
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa...!

29:46.327 --> 29:48.413
(grunting)

29:49.748 --> 29:51.082
-(Tim screams)
-Upsies.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.543
-I need upsies...!
-Oh!

29:53.585 --> 29:54.961
-(Ted yells)
-TIM: Get dressed.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.714
(both grunting and groaning)

29:57.756 --> 29:59.341
What have you done to me?!

29:59.382 --> 30:01.301
No, really?
What, are we going sailing?

30:01.343 --> 30:03.470
Oh, no.
No, no, it's leaving.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.804
(both yell)

30:04.846 --> 30:06.723
(grunts, whimpers)

30:06.765 --> 30:08.141
Wait, no, no. Stop!

30:08.183 --> 30:10.310
Stop, stop, stop. Come back!

30:10.352 --> 30:11.478
Ahoy!

30:11.519 --> 30:12.812
Come back!

30:12.854 --> 30:14.564
(panting)

30:14.606 --> 30:16.024
Great, matey.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.609
What are we gonna do now?

30:18.777 --> 30:21.237
(whistling)

30:21.279 --> 30:23.365
* *

30:26.534 --> 30:28.578
(neighing)

30:33.541 --> 30:35.919
(slow-motion):
Oh, no!

30:35.960 --> 30:37.921
(continues whistling)

30:38.713 --> 30:39.673
(whinnies)

30:39.714 --> 30:42.342
Precious, my noble steed.

30:42.384 --> 30:45.512
We must not be late
for our first day of school.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.641
Oh, gross.

30:49.683 --> 30:51.351
-Huh?
-(Tim screaming)

30:51.393 --> 30:53.687
Tallyho, Precious!

30:53.728 --> 30:56.022
(Tim continues screaming)

30:58.233 --> 30:59.818
This pony hates me. Oh!

30:59.859 --> 31:01.277
It's not that
she hates you, Tim.

31:01.319 --> 31:02.862
She just doesn't respect you.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.323
(Tim screams, whimpers)

31:05.365 --> 31:07.367
(horns honking)

31:07.409 --> 31:08.743
Go left! Go left!

31:08.785 --> 31:10.704
I'm gonna go
where navigation says.

31:10.745 --> 31:11.913
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Turn left.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.289
Thank you, navigation.

31:13.331 --> 31:14.916

-AUTOMATED VOICE: Turn right.

Proceed on the current route.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Recalculating.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.635
Hold on to your holster.

31:25.677 --> 31:26.928
-Hyah!
-(yells)

31:26.970 --> 31:28.763

31:28.805 --> 31:30.765
(grunts)
Oh, no. It's Carol!

31:30.807 --> 31:31.891
Don't answer it.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.059
-Hi.
-CAROL: Oh, Tim.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.310
How's your bonding trip?

31:34.352 --> 31:36.062
Uh... Whoa!

31:36.104 --> 31:37.397
Whoa. Slow down.

31:37.439 --> 31:40.191
How... is... your...

31:40.233 --> 31:42.110
-bonding trip?
-Aah! Whoa.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.738
(screams) You're here!

31:44.779 --> 31:46.698
-Oh, no.
-TIM: I mean, um,

31:46.740 --> 31:48.074
I wish you were here.

31:48.116 --> 31:49.325
Oh, we miss you, too.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.410
Don't we, girls?

31:50.452 --> 31:51.870
We're, uh...

31:51.911 --> 31:53.413
We're, uh, rebooting
our relationship

31:53.455 --> 31:55.498
and, uh, restoring the
closeness that we once felt.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.917
-That's so great.
-We've got to go. (chuckles)

31:57.959 --> 31:59.127
CAROL:
Where are you?

31:59.169 --> 32:00.587
-Uh, a hockey game.
-Hey!

32:00.628 --> 32:02.172
He shoots, he scores!

32:02.213 --> 32:03.465
He scores! He scores!

32:03.506 --> 32:05.091
Ladies and gentlemen,
he scores!

32:05.133 --> 32:06.676
-* Busted... *
-* Busted... *

32:06.718 --> 32:07.844
-* Busted. *
-(sirens wail)

32:07.886 --> 32:09.679
Is that the police?

32:10.764 --> 32:12.098
Uh, no, not the police.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.933
It's, uh...
it's a hockey alarm.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.143
Faster, Tim.

32:15.185 --> 32:16.895
I ain't going back
to the clink!

32:16.936 --> 32:18.355
Now, I just wanted
to remind you

32:18.396 --> 32:20.190
that Tabitha's pageant
is tomorrow night.

32:20.231 --> 32:22.025
You have to be there.

32:22.067 --> 32:25.779
Uh, I will be there
in one shape or another.

32:25.820 --> 32:26.946
(Ted grunts)

32:26.988 --> 32:29.115
-You promise?
-I promise.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.533
And what about Ted?

32:30.575 --> 32:31.951
Happy holidays, coppers.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.913
You're never gonna
take me alive, see?

32:34.954 --> 32:36.206
Uh, he's busy.

32:36.247 --> 32:37.957
What are you doing?
It's the cops.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.459
-(Ted laughs)
-Sorry, Officers.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.378
TED: Santa's got something
for everybody.

32:41.419 --> 32:42.462
TIM:
Sorry.

32:42.504 --> 32:44.589
* *

32:48.009 --> 32:49.135
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Recalculating.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.637
(Tim screams, Ted laughs)

32:50.679 --> 32:52.305
Oh, my God! It's so real!

32:52.347 --> 32:54.307
It's so real! It's so real!

32:54.349 --> 32:55.934

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Recalculating.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.986
And now the moment
we've all waited for!

33:07.028 --> 33:09.364
(people screaming)

33:11.741 --> 33:13.034
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Proceed on the current route.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.202

-See, Tim?

33:14.244 --> 33:15.704

-Always trust... Holy...

33:15.745 --> 33:17.122
-(Tim screaming)
-CAROL: Tim?

33:17.163 --> 33:18.415
TIM:
Uh, Carol?

33:18.456 --> 33:20.125
You're breaking up.
I'm losing you.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.584
No, honey, I can hear you fine.

33:21.626 --> 33:23.837
-See you at the pageant.
Got to go. Bye. -Okay.

33:23.878 --> 33:24.963
(yells)

33:25.005 --> 33:27.757
-(screams) Whoa!
-Sorry.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.175
(yells)

33:29.217 --> 33:30.260
(Jimbo whimpering)

33:30.301 --> 33:32.262
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:32.303 --> 33:34.681

33:34.723 --> 33:37.183

TED:
Tallyho, Precious!

33:46.151 --> 33:48.653
No, no, no, tally...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:03.918 --> 34:05.670
-JIMBO: Tree!
-(siren whoops)

34:05.712 --> 34:07.672
AUTOMATED VOICE: You've arrived
at your destination.

34:07.714 --> 34:10.091
-And with a minute to spare.
-(distant explosion)

34:10.133 --> 34:12.844
Oh. Huh.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.012
I'll send them a check.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.138
(both chuckling)

34:15.180 --> 34:16.431
Oh, that was fun.

34:16.473 --> 34:17.891
You did it.

34:17.932 --> 34:19.225
We did it.

34:19.267 --> 34:20.977
I guess we did.

34:21.019 --> 34:22.812
I was talking about
me and Precious.

34:22.854 --> 34:24.814
-Oh.
-Isn't that right, baby?

34:24.856 --> 34:26.024
Yeah. Right.

34:26.066 --> 34:27.817
-Get down!

34:33.782 --> 34:35.825

34:42.457 --> 34:45.043
Whoa.
This place even looks evil.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.003
TED:
It's just a school.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.755
You're overreacting.

34:48.797 --> 34:50.006
And so is BabyCorp.

34:50.048 --> 34:51.299
No, I'm telling you,

34:51.341 --> 34:53.218
this school is stressing
Tabitha out.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.969
Tabitha can handle it.

34:55.011 --> 34:57.097
She's a real chip
off the old block.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.099
-Wait, who's the block?
-I'm the block.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.934
Well, you can't be the block.
I'm the block.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.435
Then start acting like a block.

35:02.477 --> 35:04.270
Wh-What does that mean?
I'm the block.

35:04.312 --> 35:06.147
-I've always been the block.
-Yeah. Not even close.

35:06.189 --> 35:07.607
TIM:
All I do is block.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.192
I wake up in the morning,
I block.

35:09.234 --> 35:11.069
-(kids grunting)
-I go to sleep, blocking.

35:11.111 --> 35:13.446
-I'm the block.
-Tim, enough.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.032
-I'm the block.
-No, you're not! Stop it!

35:16.074 --> 35:17.325
-Shh.
-(whistle blows)

35:17.367 --> 35:18.702
(chuckles) Sweet.

35:18.743 --> 35:20.161
Suckers.

35:20.203 --> 35:22.122
-AUTOMATED VOICE: Children only
beyond this point. -Hey.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.208
No crying is permitted
in the separation zone.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.793
Okay, looks like
we got to split up.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.253
Good. I could use a break.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.380
-TABITHA: Bye, Mom.
-All right, bye, honey.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.965
(gasps, yells)
There's Tabitha.

35:32.007 --> 35:34.342
-I'll see you after school.
-Okay.

35:34.384 --> 35:36.428
(window squeaking)

35:37.220 --> 35:39.139
TED:
Apparently, there's no "A"

35:39.180 --> 35:41.349
in "teamwork," either.

35:41.391 --> 35:42.851
All right, let's boogie.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.686
(grunts) Not so fast.

35:44.728 --> 35:47.230
I'm blue. You're yellow.

35:47.272 --> 35:49.858

in the choo-choo.

35:49.899 --> 35:51.484

35:51.526 --> 35:53.945
Aw. It's full of babies.

35:53.987 --> 35:55.363
Is it? I didn't notice.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.824

Just kidding. It's hilarious.

35:57.866 --> 35:59.451
Uh, wait. Your tie's crooked.

35:59.492 --> 36:00.910
-(fingers snap)
-Okay, Tim, focus.

36:00.952 --> 36:03.663
We'll meet outside
Armstrong's office at 11:15.

36:03.705 --> 36:05.665
We'll sneak in,
and we'll plant the bugs.

36:05.707 --> 36:06.833
Are you focused?

36:06.875 --> 36:08.043
Hey, what the...

36:08.084 --> 36:10.086
-Oh, I am focused, all right.
-No, no.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.421
I'm not yellow. I'm blue.

36:11.463 --> 36:13.506
11:30. Stick to the plan.

36:13.548 --> 36:14.549
11:15.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.551
15. Got it.
The block is focused.

36:16.593 --> 36:19.387
-I'm blue! Aah! I'm blue.
-(babies laughing)

36:20.347 --> 36:22.349
Don't you understand?
I'm blue!

36:22.390 --> 36:24.351
ARMSTRONG (over speakers):
Welcome, children.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.737
-Please don't touch me.

36:35.779 --> 36:38.114
This is some
ridiculous mistake.

36:38.156 --> 36:39.616
I'm blue! I'm blue!

36:39.657 --> 36:41.368
* The wheels on the bus
go pi R-squared *

36:41.409 --> 36:43.703

-Yes.

36:46.915 --> 36:48.208
TIM:
Hello.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.001
Uh, hello.

36:50.043 --> 36:51.711
Nice plant.

36:51.753 --> 36:54.214
This is
my emotional support plant.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.049
Hi. I-I'm new here.

36:56.091 --> 37:00.261
Said nihonium to the other
elements in the periodic table.

37:00.303 --> 37:02.180
-Ooh.
-(laughter)

37:02.222 --> 37:03.723
Okay.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.392
Can't sit here.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.227
Or here. Or there.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.728
(yells)

37:08.770 --> 37:12.524
Seating position is
determined by class rank.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.651
We can't possibly
include your data,

37:14.693 --> 37:17.070
given that the rigor
of your previous school

37:17.112 --> 37:18.988
is an unknown variable.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.240
-STUDENTS: Ooh.
-(laughs)

37:20.281 --> 37:21.866
-Sick burn, Nathan.
-(grunts)

37:21.908 --> 37:23.118
-(groans)
-Ow.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.244
Here.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.413
-You can take my seat.
-(sighs)

37:26.454 --> 37:28.873
I'm so proud of you.

37:28.915 --> 37:30.875
I mean... thanks.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.377
Okay...

Good morning.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.673
STUDENTS:
Good morning, Dr. Armstrong!

37:36.715 --> 37:39.050
(chuckles)
Very warm welcome. Thank you.

37:39.092 --> 37:40.385
Huh?

37:40.427 --> 37:42.429
As you can see,
we've got a new colleague

37:42.470 --> 37:44.222
joining us today.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.724
-Ooh.
-Hello.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.517
New colleague, why don't you
introduce yourself.

37:47.559 --> 37:50.603
Uh, my name's Ti... um, Marcos.

37:50.645 --> 37:53.023
-Hmm.
-Marcos Lightspeed.

37:53.064 --> 37:55.608
Marcos Lightspeed.

37:55.650 --> 37:58.194
Yeah. Colorful, characterful,
and I like it.

37:58.236 --> 37:59.821
-In any case...
-(gasps)

37:59.863 --> 38:02.449
-...welcome, Marcos,
to Blue Unit. -(gasps)

38:02.490 --> 38:04.242
Our most advanced class.

38:04.284 --> 38:07.078
Ooh, this is rarefied air

38:07.120 --> 38:08.413
-we're breathing.
-(groans)

38:08.455 --> 38:10.331
Here at The Acorn Center,
we believe

38:10.373 --> 38:12.417
that all competition is...

38:12.459 --> 38:14.961
STUDENTS:
Healthy competition.

38:15.003 --> 38:17.422
(babies yelling, laughing)

38:17.464 --> 38:19.841
(noisemakers blaring)

38:23.511 --> 38:26.890
I'm trapped
in the dum-dum holding tank.

38:26.931 --> 38:30.268
(gasps)
I'm having a panic attack.

38:30.310 --> 38:32.687
There must be
a way out of here.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.817
Something doesn't smell right.

38:37.859 --> 38:39.944
(sniffs) Blueberry.

38:39.986 --> 38:41.696
(laughing)

38:41.738 --> 38:43.907
(whispers):
I have to get out of here.

38:43.948 --> 38:45.158
Hi.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.659
Don't look at me.

38:46.701 --> 38:48.661
-Okay.
-(baby laughing)

38:48.703 --> 38:50.955
And our first subject
today is...

38:50.997 --> 38:53.083
No fractions, no fractions,
no fractions. Whoa!

38:54.084 --> 38:55.835
Particle physics.

38:55.877 --> 38:57.003
Yes! What?

38:57.045 --> 38:58.129
Yes! (laughs)

38:58.171 --> 38:59.631
Who knows which scientist

38:59.673 --> 39:01.883
first theorized
that the universe has a limit

39:01.925 --> 39:04.594
beyond which
the laws of physics break down?

39:04.636 --> 39:06.179
(students clamoring)

39:06.221 --> 39:07.931
Wow. Everybody seems to know.

39:07.972 --> 39:11.434
-(sighs, gasps)
-Señor Lightspeed.

39:11.476 --> 39:14.979
Um, Dr. Flam... baisley?

39:15.021 --> 39:17.857
-(buzzer sounds)
-Oh, that's the wrong answer.

39:17.899 --> 39:20.694
His brain sure doesn't move
at light speed.

39:20.735 --> 39:21.861
(laughter)

39:21.903 --> 39:23.488
-ARMSTRONG: Uh, okay.
-I know, right?

39:23.530 --> 39:25.365
-Anybody else?
-Right here.

39:25.407 --> 39:26.783
-Max Planck.
-(bell dings)

39:26.825 --> 39:28.284
ARMSTRONG:
That's correct.

39:28.326 --> 39:29.703
Tabitha has set the bar.

39:29.744 --> 39:31.413
First one on the board.
Ding, ding, ding.

39:31.454 --> 39:33.540
Way to go, Tabitha.

39:33.581 --> 39:36.042
You're going down, Templeton.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.502
Bring it on, Nathan.

39:37.544 --> 39:38.712
Yeah, Tabitha. Get him.

39:38.753 --> 39:41.256
ARMSTRONG:
Next subject.

39:41.297 --> 39:42.882
Ancient Greek.

39:42.924 --> 39:45.719
-STUDENTS: Opa!
-Oprah! (chuckles)

39:45.760 --> 39:47.887
-(laughter, babbling)
-Attention.

39:47.929 --> 39:49.764
Attention, everyone.

39:49.806 --> 39:52.475
Who wants to play Shawshank?

39:52.517 --> 39:53.977
-No!
-BABIES: Huh?

39:54.811 --> 39:57.981
Who wants to go outside
and play?

39:58.023 --> 40:01.109
-(cheering)
-Does that sound fun? Good.

40:01.151 --> 40:03.069
Now, anybody have any ideas?

40:03.111 --> 40:04.404
-BABY: No!
-Come on, people.

40:04.446 --> 40:05.530
Think, think, think,
think, think.

40:05.572 --> 40:06.781
We need to think
outside the box.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.241
-Oh, oh, oh! Me, me! Oh!
-You, Bo-Peep.

40:08.283 --> 40:11.327
We can build a hot-air balloon

40:11.369 --> 40:13.288
out of Popsicle sticks
and bubble gum!

40:13.329 --> 40:14.622
(laughing)

40:14.664 --> 40:16.332
And how would it fly?

40:16.374 --> 40:18.251
-Pixie dust!
-(laughing, cheering)

40:18.293 --> 40:19.794
Get back in the box, Bo-Peep.

40:19.836 --> 40:22.088
-All the way in?
-All the way in.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.299
-Yay! -Ooh. Uh, can we get
in the box, too?

40:24.341 --> 40:26.343
-Can we? Can we?
-BABY: Glue.

40:26.384 --> 40:28.303
I like glue.

40:28.345 --> 40:29.512
Who doesn't?

40:29.554 --> 40:30.972
But we're trying
to brainstorm here.

40:31.014 --> 40:32.265
Glue's good.

40:32.307 --> 40:33.975
(laughing wildly)

40:34.017 --> 40:36.770
-Think, think, think, think,
think, think... -(groans)

40:36.811 --> 40:39.939
...think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think!

40:39.981 --> 40:41.441
Bingo.

40:41.483 --> 40:42.776
Next subject.

40:42.817 --> 40:45.445
X is equal
to the derivative of...

40:45.487 --> 40:46.738
-NATHAN: Ooh, me!
-Itself.

40:46.780 --> 40:48.406
ARMSTRONG:
Kudos for Tabitha.

40:48.448 --> 40:49.908
Wow. You knew that?

40:49.949 --> 40:53.244
The world's leading producer
of bauxite is...

40:53.286 --> 40:54.746
-NATHAN: Oh!
-Australia.

40:54.788 --> 40:56.122
ARMSTRONG: Once again,
Tabitha's on the board.

40:56.164 --> 40:58.375
-Very good. -Yes, Tabitha!
-(applause)

40:58.416 --> 41:00.001
We got 15 minutes, people.

41:00.043 --> 41:02.170
The difference
in "try" and "triumph"

41:02.212 --> 41:03.963
is just a little oomph.

41:04.005 --> 41:07.092
-BABIES: Oomph!
-Go big or go home.

41:07.133 --> 41:08.718
Okay. Going home.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.512
-Let's pick up the pace.
-No!

41:10.553 --> 41:13.556
Hand downs, Norma Rae.
This is my time.

41:13.598 --> 41:15.725
To be, or not to be?
Tabitha.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.310
-To be. -That's correct.
-(bell dings)

41:17.352 --> 41:21.314
Can anyone tell me
the horsepower of a 302 engine?

41:21.356 --> 41:23.149
-Uh, seven?
-(buzzer sounds)

41:23.191 --> 41:24.901
-ARMSTRONG: Oh, boy.
-Weak sauce, Nathan.

41:24.943 --> 41:26.486
-That was weak.
-(groans)

41:26.528 --> 41:27.737
Tabitha, do you have
an idea about that?

41:27.779 --> 41:30.323
300 horsepower
with a four-barrel carb.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.616
-(bell dings) -TIM: Wow.
-(groans)

41:31.658 --> 41:33.493
-Her dad must be a genius.

On my signal, unleash heck.

She did it.

41:50.552 --> 41:52.178
STUDENTS:
Marcos!

41:52.220 --> 41:54.472
I did it. I did it.

41:54.514 --> 41:56.349
(babies cheering)

41:56.391 --> 42:00.270
Remember, your size doesn't
determine your strength.

42:01.813 --> 42:04.190
Well, so far,
it's Tabitha number one

42:04.232 --> 42:05.692

42:05.734 --> 42:08.361

Psst. Hey, Tabitha.

42:16.453 --> 42:17.662
You're really...

42:17.704 --> 42:20.290
-A geek. I know.
-No.

42:20.331 --> 42:22.208
You're amazing.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.544
Oh. Thanks, Marcos.

42:24.586 --> 42:28.048
You'll be singing
a different tune at rehearsal.

42:28.089 --> 42:30.133
The wrong tune.

42:30.175 --> 42:31.343
(both laughing)

42:31.384 --> 42:32.635
You're so funny.

42:32.677 --> 42:34.346
Hilarious!

42:53.782 --> 42:55.033
Yes, Marcos.

42:55.075 --> 42:57.869
Can I have a hall pass?
I have to go.

42:57.911 --> 43:00.413
ARMSTRONG:
Voilà. Feel free.

43:00.455 --> 43:02.082

43:02.123 --> 43:03.875
-(grunts) Now what?
-(babies crying)

43:03.917 --> 43:05.502
Glue!

43:05.543 --> 43:07.379
Glue is bad!

43:07.420 --> 43:09.089

43:09.130 --> 43:10.256
Glue.

43:10.298 --> 43:12.717

Glue is good.

43:12.759 --> 43:16.096
How to get to
the principal's office.

43:16.137 --> 43:17.597
Of course.

43:17.639 --> 43:20.517
You get sent

All right. I'm afraid you can't

Oh, no. Are we gonna have
a talk in your office?

44:16.072 --> 44:17.657
No.

If you want something
done right,

45:02.202 --> 45:04.871
you have to do it
without your brother!

45:05.747 --> 45:08.833
We meet again, doorknob.

Please come in. <i>Entrez vous?</i>

45:19.803 --> 45:21.221
You're here.

45:21.262 --> 45:22.764
Oh, yes. I...

45:22.806 --> 45:24.974
I was expecting you.

45:25.809 --> 45:27.894
I... (grunts, yells)

45:27.936 --> 45:28.895
(button beeps)

45:28.937 --> 45:31.231
I expected that you

45:31.272 --> 45:34.317
would be expecting me,
so there.

45:34.359 --> 45:37.862
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
I know why you're here,

45:48.206 --> 45:49.874
-You know what you are?
-Mm?

45:49.916 --> 45:54.254
You are, if I may,
extremely intelligent.

45:54.295 --> 45:55.755
Go on. (grunts)

45:55.797 --> 45:57.382
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I've been observing you.

45:57.424 --> 45:58.550
(button beeps)

45:58.591 --> 46:00.510
Spends time wisely. Check.

46:00.552 --> 46:03.179
Makes good use of
classroom materials. Check.

46:03.221 --> 46:05.765
Keeps hands to self. Check.

46:05.807 --> 46:07.308
Hey, forget
"works well with others."

46:07.350 --> 46:10.437
You make others
work well for you.

46:10.478 --> 46:13.857
That's literally the title
of the book I'm working on.

46:13.898 --> 46:16.109
No kidding.
You had no business

46:16.151 --> 46:18.236
being in Yellow Level, did you?

46:18.278 --> 46:20.613
-It was sabotage.
-Sabotage. Exactly.

46:20.655 --> 46:23.199
Jealousy, fear. Hey, I faced
the same obstacles.

46:23.241 --> 46:26.828
In fact, you know,
you remind me a lot of myself

46:26.870 --> 46:29.289
when I was your age,

46:29.330 --> 46:32.125
which is now.

46:32.167 --> 46:33.585
(grunts)

46:35.545 --> 46:36.629
What?

46:36.671 --> 46:37.964

46:38.006 --> 46:41.301
Surprise, surprise.

I repeat, you're a baby.

46:50.018 --> 46:52.479
So surprised,
you said it twice. (chuckles)

46:52.520 --> 46:53.980
(laughs)

46:54.022 --> 46:57.484
Unfortunately, people are, uh,
not ready for a...

46:57.525 --> 46:59.736
a baby in a position of power.

46:59.778 --> 47:01.279
Yet.

47:01.321 --> 47:03.990
Remind me to get the number
of your muttonchop guy.

47:04.032 --> 47:06.826
You know, I could use
somebody like you.

47:06.868 --> 47:10.789
With a superior intelligence
like my own.

47:10.830 --> 47:13.500
-Uh... really?
-Mmm.

47:13.541 --> 47:14.918
Somebody who can, uh...

47:14.959 --> 47:17.087
Mmm. (crunching)

47:17.128 --> 47:18.505
-Mmm. Yeah.
-(gasps)

47:18.546 --> 47:21.257
Truly comprehend
what I'm trying to accomplish.

47:21.299 --> 47:24.010
-Well, you're looking at him.
-Bingo.

Mmm. We have a secret level.

47:26.262 --> 47:27.889
Mmm.
For very special babies.

Mmm. The best of the best.

47:29.432 --> 47:30.642
Ah. The elite.

Oh, yeah. Way beyond.

Mmm. There's a meeting today...

...after school.

47:39.651 --> 47:41.152
Babies only.

We may be small, but we're
about to teach grown-ups

47:44.072 --> 47:46.408
a big lesson.

47:47.784 --> 47:49.703
Mmm. Lolly?

47:49.744 --> 47:51.037
-Okay.

He better not be talking to me,

You're right, Connie.

He's talking about Armstrong.

gotten into her. -(gasps)

48:17.272 --> 48:20.900
-But she's acting strange,
Dr. Federman. -(laughing)

48:20.942 --> 48:23.153
Isn't it a bit early
for terrible twos?

48:23.194 --> 48:25.030
Is there terrible ones?
Is that a thing?

48:25.071 --> 48:26.573
Oh, piano-playing bunny,
you slay me.

48:26.614 --> 48:28.158
Okey dokey.

visual confirmation here.

48:33.830 --> 48:36.041
Oh, Daddy.

I'd pinch you so hard.

Where is he? Where is he?

No, not my bows.

Could you let me through,
please?

49:23.838 --> 49:25.256
No!

49:25.298 --> 49:27.967
So, what, did you flunk
coloring class, kid?

49:28.009 --> 49:29.594

-Really, guy?

49:30.553 --> 49:32.305
Mmm, cherry.

See? I'm cool.

49:38.603 --> 49:39.813
I'm cool.

49:39.854 --> 49:41.648
You failed me, Tim.

49:41.690 --> 49:43.108
I was desperate.

49:43.149 --> 49:45.819
I crawled.
I did things with glue

49:45.860 --> 49:48.238
that I'm not proud of,
but I made it.

49:48.279 --> 49:50.198
I made it all the way
to Armstrong's office,

49:50.240 --> 49:52.200
and then where's Tim?

49:52.242 --> 49:53.410
-I know. I...
-Where's Tim?

49:53.451 --> 49:55.161
-I tried to...
-Where's Tim?!

49:55.203 --> 49:57.038
-I was in the Box, okay?
-(babies gasping)

49:57.080 --> 49:58.289
-TED: The Box?
-The Box?

49:58.331 --> 49:59.165
Glue.

49:59.207 --> 50:00.709
Yeah, that's right.

50:00.750 --> 50:01.960
(whispers):
The Box.

50:02.002 --> 50:03.336
Show a little respect.

50:03.378 --> 50:06.256
See, Tim, this is why
I work alone.

50:06.297 --> 50:08.842
-(sighs)
-I'll succeed in the mission.

50:08.883 --> 50:10.385
You can take the pony home.

50:10.427 --> 50:12.762
The only thing
you're ever gonna succeed at

50:12.804 --> 50:13.805
is being alone.

50:13.847 --> 50:15.015
-Fine.
-Fine!

50:15.056 --> 50:16.516
Fine!

50:16.558 --> 50:18.018
I like ponies.

50:18.059 --> 50:20.395
Aah! Thank you for sharing.

50:20.437 --> 50:22.731
(piano playing gentle tune)

50:25.567 --> 50:27.402
-(Nathan groans in frustration)
-(piano plays discordant notes)

50:27.444 --> 50:29.029
NATHAN:
You are blowing it, Templeton!

50:29.070 --> 50:30.196
MEGHAN:
Yeah, Templeton.

50:30.238 --> 50:31.614
TABITHA:
I'm trying.

50:31.656 --> 50:34.284
NATHAN: Ugh! You always
come in a beat late.

50:34.325 --> 50:36.786
I'm sorry, Nathan.
I'm doing my best.

50:36.828 --> 50:40.707
Your best is going to keep me
out of going to Juilliard.

50:40.749 --> 50:42.667
-Yeah, Templeton.
-It's one, two, three

50:42.709 --> 50:45.086
-and one, two, three.
-MEGHAN: One, two, three.

50:45.128 --> 50:46.588
NATHAN and MEGHAN:
And one, two, three

50:46.629 --> 50:49.382
and one, two, three
and one, two, three.

50:49.424 --> 50:52.719
-And one, two...
-Oh, come on!

50:52.761 --> 50:54.054
Are you kidding me?

50:54.095 --> 50:55.722
I just can't do it
right now, okay?

50:55.764 --> 50:57.182
I can't. I just can't.

50:57.223 --> 50:59.351
-I'll do it tomorrow.
-MEGHAN: Seriously?

50:59.392 --> 51:01.227
-(school bell rings)
-(kids cheering)

51:01.269 --> 51:03.480
NATHAN: All right,
all right, all right.

51:03.521 --> 51:05.899
See you at the pageant
tomorrow.

51:05.940 --> 51:07.859
Beat it!

51:12.489 --> 51:15.658
MEGHAN: Oh, Nathan,
Nathan, let me do it.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.035
Let me do it, Nathan.

51:17.077 --> 51:18.578
I want to sing the song.

51:18.620 --> 51:19.913
No.

51:19.954 --> 51:21.873
I want to see her fail.

51:21.915 --> 51:23.583
Oh.

51:23.625 --> 51:25.210
Pure genius.

51:25.251 --> 51:27.420
-(laughing)
-(plays ominous chords)

51:27.462 --> 51:29.089
NATHAN:
I can't wait.

51:29.130 --> 51:30.632
-We'll see about that.
-(school bell ringing)

51:30.674 --> 51:32.592
ARMSTRONG (over speaker):
Goodbye, children.

51:32.634 --> 51:33.760
Sayonara.

51:33.802 --> 51:35.095
Auf Wiedersehen.

51:35.136 --> 51:36.262
Adieu.

51:36.304 --> 51:38.223
<i>Adios, niños.</i>

51:38.264 --> 51:39.766
(students chattering)

51:39.808 --> 51:41.267
-(sighs)
-(horse neighs)

51:41.309 --> 51:42.894
(Tim gasps)

51:42.936 --> 51:44.270
Oh, come on.

51:45.146 --> 51:46.356
(yells)

51:47.482 --> 51:48.858
(yelps)

51:48.900 --> 51:51.277
Oh, my gosh.

51:51.319 --> 51:54.739
-Stop what you're doing.
-(chatter stops)

51:54.781 --> 51:56.116
I see a baby pony.

51:56.157 --> 51:57.951
-(screaming)
-(excited chatter)

51:57.992 --> 51:59.494
I like ponies.

51:59.536 --> 52:00.787
STUDENT:
Oh, over there!

52:00.829 --> 52:01.955
-Yes!
-(laughter)

52:01.996 --> 52:04.124
It's so cute!

52:04.165 --> 52:05.917
(excited chatter)

52:05.959 --> 52:08.336
(horn honks)

52:12.215 --> 52:14.009
That's it? No hello?

52:14.050 --> 52:16.052
-Not even a "Hi, Mom"?
-What?

52:16.094 --> 52:17.929
-Hi, Tabitha!
-(gasps)

52:17.971 --> 52:19.848
-Oh. Hi.
-(Tina coughs)

52:20.640 --> 52:22.225
What?
You never told me you had

52:22.267 --> 52:24.102
an older sister
who could drive.

52:24.144 --> 52:25.603
Uh, that's my mom.

52:25.645 --> 52:27.355
Tabitha, don't interrupt.
(chuckles)

52:27.397 --> 52:29.441
-Yeah, I'm a new friend
of Tabitha's... -Hey, stop.

52:29.482 --> 52:31.484
-(mumbling)
-Oh, really?

52:31.526 --> 52:33.319
I-I mean, we just met.

52:33.361 --> 52:34.362
Well, what's your name,
new friend?

52:34.404 --> 52:36.448
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

52:36.489 --> 52:38.783
-Marcos. Marcos Lightspeed.
-(horse neighs)

52:38.825 --> 52:40.160
(babbles, grunts)

52:40.201 --> 52:41.536
-Ow!
-CAROL: Tina!

52:41.578 --> 52:42.996
-What is with you?
-(Tim chuckles)

52:43.038 --> 52:44.456
Cute kid.

52:44.497 --> 52:46.416
Well, I better get going
if I'm gonna walk those

52:46.458 --> 52:49.002
three and a half miles home...

52:49.044 --> 52:50.378
in the snow...

52:50.420 --> 52:52.005
without a jacket.

52:52.047 --> 52:53.840
Three and a half miles?

52:53.882 --> 52:56.676
Three and a half, six--
somewhere in there. (chuckles)

52:56.718 --> 52:59.054
Yeah, well, that TV dinner
is not gonna microwave itself.

52:59.095 --> 53:00.472
TV dinner?

53:00.513 --> 53:02.849
Yeah, I'm a latchkey kid,
so I eat whatever I want.

53:02.891 --> 53:04.893
-Cartoons are my babysitter.
-(tires screech)

53:04.934 --> 53:06.102
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

53:06.144 --> 53:08.104
(scoffs)

53:08.146 --> 53:11.399
* Strangers in the night *

53:11.441 --> 53:13.902
* Exchanging glances *

53:13.943 --> 53:15.195
* Lovers... *

53:15.236 --> 53:16.696
What is this?

53:16.738 --> 53:19.032
Some kind of prank?

53:19.074 --> 53:20.367
Children can be so cruel.

53:20.408 --> 53:21.826
-Hello.
-(electronic chime)

53:21.868 --> 53:24.662

53:36.841 --> 53:40.929
Whoa. This is exactly like
Bill Gates' rec room...

53:40.970 --> 53:43.431
but a little smaller.

53:44.182 --> 53:46.267
(grunting)

53:47.227 --> 53:49.479
-(straining)
-(scraping)

53:52.315 --> 53:55.068
What is all this?

53:55.110 --> 53:57.362
Research and development?

53:58.697 --> 54:00.907
Product testing?

54:02.534 --> 54:06.996
Huh. Something tells me
this isn't day care.

54:08.039 --> 54:10.917
Boy, could I use
a spy camera right about now.

54:10.959 --> 54:14.462
* Sail away, sail away,
sail away. *

54:15.255 --> 54:17.007
Anyway...

Aw.

54:22.721 --> 54:25.765

in that little karate outfit.

54:25.807 --> 54:27.100
(baby grunts)

54:27.142 --> 54:28.351
Huh.

54:28.393 --> 54:30.520
(all whooping, grunting)

54:30.562 --> 54:33.273
Is this some kind
of a ninja boy band?

54:33.314 --> 54:34.482
(screams)

54:34.524 --> 54:37.110
-Whoa...!
-(babies whooping)

54:37.152 --> 54:39.112
Whoa!

Oh. Whoa, whoa.

Whoa. (yells)

54:47.662 --> 54:48.621
I give up.

54:48.663 --> 54:52.375

54:55.462 --> 54:57.297
TED:
Sayonara, baby!

54:57.339 --> 54:59.341
-Hey, there you are.
-Oh, hello! (coughs)

54:59.382 --> 55:00.675
Thank you. (sighs)

55:00.717 --> 55:02.469
I see that you've angered
my baby ninjas.

55:02.510 --> 55:03.887
-Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
-(baby laughs, grunts)

55:03.928 --> 55:05.638
-Shoo. Shoo. (chuckles)
-(sneezes, babbles)

55:05.680 --> 55:07.849
What maniacal underground
fortress doesn't have ninjas?

55:07.891 --> 55:09.476
-Am I right? (grunts)
-Impressive, huh?

55:09.517 --> 55:10.810
Pretty impressive.

55:10.852 --> 55:12.312
What do you think?
What do you think?

55:12.354 --> 55:13.438
TED:
I know tuition is pretty steep,

55:13.480 --> 55:15.565
but how do you afford all this?

55:15.607 --> 55:17.525
ARMSTRONG:
Oh, that's a good question.

55:17.567 --> 55:20.111
-I taught babies to code.
-No.

55:20.153 --> 55:22.113
ARMSTRONG: Yes. And you know
what they say about having

55:22.155 --> 55:24.324
an infinite amount of monkeys
banging on typewriters?

55:24.366 --> 55:26.201
They will eventually
write Shakespeare?

55:26.242 --> 55:28.370
A-plus.
Oh, boy, you are smart.

55:28.411 --> 55:32.290
Or the most popular apps
that money can buy.

55:32.332 --> 55:34.376

55:36.044 --> 55:37.337

I love Stock Crush.

55:43.718 --> 55:46.596
All us. But my next app...

55:46.638 --> 55:49.349
ooh, it's gonna change
the world.

55:49.391 --> 55:50.433
Forever.

55:50.475 --> 55:51.768
So why bother with a school?

55:51.810 --> 55:54.312
You could go public
and make millions.

55:54.354 --> 55:56.064
Oh. (laughs)

55:56.106 --> 55:58.441
-Billions.
-Billions.

55:58.483 --> 56:01.528
Yeah, but some things are
more important than money.

56:01.569 --> 56:03.196
Please don't say "love."

56:03.238 --> 56:05.407
Mmm. Power.

56:05.448 --> 56:07.617
That's more like it.

56:08.576 --> 56:10.453

Wow. This is so amazing.

56:10.495 --> 56:13.206

Man, you guys

You're welcome anytime.

56:23.216 --> 56:24.843

-Okay, Mom.

56:24.884 --> 56:27.095
Really? You're just gonna
throw that right there, huh?

56:27.137 --> 56:28.263
(gasps)

56:28.304 --> 56:30.890
Psst. Psst. Daddy.

56:30.932 --> 56:32.767
-Shh! It's Marcos.
-What are you doing here?

56:32.809 --> 56:34.352
-Where's Uncle Ted?
-What?

56:34.394 --> 56:35.395
He kicked me off the mission.

56:35.437 --> 56:36.354
He can't do that.

56:36.396 --> 56:37.397
Only I can do that.

56:37.439 --> 56:38.606
You're back on the mission.

56:38.648 --> 56:40.066
No need.
I have my own mission now.

56:40.108 --> 56:42.360
What? What could be more
important than my mission?

56:42.402 --> 56:44.571
Got to go. Lightspeed out.

56:45.780 --> 56:47.240
This is so great.
(chuckles)

56:47.282 --> 56:48.825
Well, I hope you're hungry.

56:48.867 --> 56:50.535
Been so long since I've
used silverware. (chuckles)

56:50.577 --> 56:53.038
So, how'd you like
your first day?

56:53.079 --> 56:54.414
Kind of intense.

56:54.456 --> 56:56.416
(chuckles):
Yeah. You'll get used to it.

56:56.458 --> 56:57.959
-Even that Nathan kid?
-Nathan.

56:58.001 --> 57:00.211
-Ugh. He's a mess.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

57:00.253 --> 57:02.422
-He is such a square.
-A square?

57:02.464 --> 57:04.424
Uh, yeah, you know,
like a dork.

57:04.466 --> 57:06.343
Dweeb. Nerdlet.
A real poindexter.

57:06.384 --> 57:07.886
Lame-o. Dorkus to the max.

57:07.927 --> 57:09.721
(chuckles)
They used to call me.

57:09.763 --> 57:12.223
-(chuckles) You're weird.
-I am?

57:12.265 --> 57:14.267
Yeah, but in a good way.

57:14.309 --> 57:15.769
(both chuckle)

57:15.810 --> 57:18.355
So, why is the pageant
stressing you out so much?

57:18.396 --> 57:20.482
(groans)
I have to sing.

57:20.523 --> 57:22.692
-So what?
-I don't know.

57:22.734 --> 57:25.070
My whole family is
going to be there,

57:25.111 --> 57:27.238
including my dad.

57:27.280 --> 57:28.782
Oh.

57:28.823 --> 57:30.200
Right.

57:30.241 --> 57:32.285
You're embarrassed of him?

57:32.327 --> 57:34.371
No. No, it's not that.

57:34.412 --> 57:35.914
(Tim sighs heavily)

57:35.955 --> 57:37.707
It's just, he's really good
at this kind of thing--

57:37.749 --> 57:41.503
being creative
and using your imagination--

57:41.544 --> 57:43.546
but it's hard for me.

57:43.588 --> 57:45.799
I just want him
to be proud of me.

57:45.840 --> 57:47.133
You know?

57:47.175 --> 57:49.135
(coos)

57:49.177 --> 57:50.136
Really?

57:50.178 --> 57:52.847
Well, yeah.

57:53.807 --> 57:55.975
Um, who are
these extra plates for?

57:56.017 --> 57:57.811
-(doorbell rings)

57:57.852 --> 57:59.729
Hey, hey!
The key still works!

57:59.771 --> 58:01.272
You guys should really
change the locks.

58:01.314 --> 58:02.857
-Oh, you made it.
-Look who's here!

58:02.899 --> 58:03.650
Mom and Dad.

Grandma! Grandpa!

tabby cat. -Yay! You're here!

58:08.154 --> 58:10.198
-Look at how big you are.
-You're almost a teenager.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.616
Can you vote yet?

58:11.658 --> 58:12.867
TABITHA: Ten and a half
more years, Grandma.

58:12.909 --> 58:14.119
Daddy, they're gonna
recognize you.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.286
No, no. It's fine.

58:15.328 --> 58:17.205
I've got the glasses. See?

58:17.247 --> 58:18.665
-TED SR. and TABITHA: Selfie!
-How do you do it again?

58:18.707 --> 58:19.958
Bring out the baby.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.543
-Hide!
-Where are you hiding that baby?

58:21.584 --> 58:22.961
No. Just be cool. Be cool.

58:23.003 --> 58:24.504
-JANICE: There she is.
-TED SR.: Hello.

58:24.546 --> 58:25.755
TED SR.:
Hey, who's the new guy?

58:25.797 --> 58:27.674
-That's Marcos.
-I gotcha.

58:27.716 --> 58:30.927
(babies clamoring)

58:30.969 --> 58:33.263
Attention, babies. <i>Bienvenue.</i>

58:33.304 --> 58:35.015
<i>Willkommen.</i>

58:35.056 --> 58:36.391
<i>Dobro pozhalovat'.</i>

58:36.433 --> 58:39.144
-And namaste.
-(clamoring continues)

58:39.185 --> 58:41.104
Uh, babies.

58:41.146 --> 58:42.439
Hey, hey.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.898
-No more screen time.
-(clamoring stops)

58:43.940 --> 58:46.276
-(whimpering)
-ARMSTRONG: Listen.

58:46.317 --> 58:49.571
Believe it or not,
I used to be just like you.

58:49.612 --> 58:52.198
-(cooing)
-Yes. I even had parents.

58:52.240 --> 58:55.618
Mine were child psychologists

58:55.660 --> 58:58.121
who made me part
of an experiment.

58:58.163 --> 58:59.372
Really?

58:59.414 --> 59:02.042
They exposed me to 10,000 hours

59:02.083 --> 59:05.628
-of Mozart, language lessons
and public radio. -Huh. Wow.

59:05.670 --> 59:07.422
I hate public radio.

59:07.464 --> 59:10.967
It was at that point I realized
I was smarter than my parents.

59:11.009 --> 59:14.971
And with my first step,
I ran away from home.

59:15.013 --> 59:17.223
-(babies moan sadly)
-Why?

59:17.265 --> 59:19.059
They pushed me around.

59:19.100 --> 59:21.227
I got told what to do
all the time.

59:21.269 --> 59:22.395
(crying)

59:22.437 --> 59:25.440
But a single word
changed my life.

59:25.482 --> 59:27.067
"No." Say it.

59:27.108 --> 59:28.401
ALL:
No!

59:28.443 --> 59:30.403
-Take a nap.
-Nyet!

59:30.445 --> 59:32.322
-Put on your coat.
<i>-Nein!</i>

59:32.364 --> 59:34.699
-Eat your vegetables.
<i>-Nahii!</i>

59:34.741 --> 59:36.993
Are you gonna let grown-ups
push you around?

59:37.035 --> 59:39.371
No, no! No, no, no!
No, no! No, no, no!

59:39.412 --> 59:40.747
-Are you?
-Good God, no.

59:40.789 --> 59:42.082
That's right.

59:42.123 --> 59:45.085
Why do parents get to be
in charge, anyway?

59:45.126 --> 59:47.504
They had their chance,
and what did we get?

59:47.545 --> 59:51.675
Pollution, politics, wars.

59:51.716 --> 59:54.052
BABIES:
Ooh.

59:54.094 --> 59:56.096
Not "ooh." "Boo."

59:56.137 --> 59:57.722
ALL:
Boo!

59:57.764 --> 1:00:01.101
The only thing holding us back
is them,

1:00:01.142 --> 1:00:02.769
but not anymore.

1:00:02.811 --> 1:00:06.690
The moment that we've worked
so hard for is almost here.

1:00:06.731 --> 1:00:07.857
-B-Day.
-(babies cheering)

1:00:07.899 --> 1:00:09.109
-B-Day?
-B-Day.

1:00:09.150 --> 1:00:11.236
-I'm this many.
-I'm this many.

1:00:11.277 --> 1:00:13.613
No, no, it's not...
it's not your birthday.

1:00:13.655 --> 1:00:16.491
It's the beginning
of the baby revolution.

1:00:16.533 --> 1:00:18.326
-Yay, yay.
-(babies cheering)

1:00:18.368 --> 1:00:20.995
And there'll be cake.
Cake for everybody.

1:00:21.037 --> 1:00:23.790
BABIES (chanting): Cake! Cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

1:00:23.832 --> 1:00:25.417
-No more rules.
-(chanting continues)

1:00:25.458 --> 1:00:27.293
<i>Oh là là!</i>

1:00:27.335 --> 1:00:29.045
No more parents.

1:00:29.087 --> 1:00:30.296
Uh-oh.

1:00:30.338 --> 1:00:31.464
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

1:00:31.506 --> 1:00:33.967
Sayonara, Mama and Papa!

1:00:34.009 --> 1:00:36.011
-Oh, this is bad.
-(chuckles)

1:00:36.052 --> 1:00:37.929
All right, pep rally's over.

1:00:37.971 --> 1:00:40.348
Your-your parents
are gonna pick you up.

1:00:40.390 --> 1:00:41.433
(crying)

1:00:41.474 --> 1:00:42.976
This is my life's work.

1:00:43.018 --> 1:00:45.937
Oh, yes, 17 long months.

1:00:45.979 --> 1:00:48.565
To... no more parents.
(laughs)

1:00:48.606 --> 1:00:50.233
Mmm. (gargles, slurps)

1:00:50.275 --> 1:00:52.694
Cheers to the revolution.

1:00:53.653 --> 1:00:55.363
-No. Nope. Nope.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1:00:55.405 --> 1:00:57.240
-No. Oh, that's a keeper.
-TABITHA: Oh, Tina.

1:00:57.282 --> 1:00:59.367
Oh, it's so cute.
What's the app called?

1:00:59.409 --> 1:01:00.827
-It's called QT Snap.
-Oh.

1:01:00.869 --> 1:01:02.787
-Show me how to download that.
-Everyone has it.

1:01:02.829 --> 1:01:04.831
So, Marcos... Lightspeed?

1:01:04.873 --> 1:01:06.458
-Is that what you said?
-Mm-hmm.

1:01:06.499 --> 1:01:08.293
Sounds like a cartoon name.

1:01:08.335 --> 1:01:09.502
(laughing)

1:01:09.544 --> 1:01:11.338
-It really does.
-(laughs awkwardly)

1:01:11.379 --> 1:01:14.299
Well, my parents,
they're a little wacky, so...

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:15.925
(slurping)

1:01:15.967 --> 1:01:18.678
Huh. It's like I know you
from somewhere.

1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:20.055
I don't think so.

1:01:20.096 --> 1:01:21.723
-That is a keeper, too.
-Hey. Hey.

1:01:21.765 --> 1:01:23.767
-Doesn't he look familiar?
-I don't think I do.

1:01:23.808 --> 1:01:25.226
Yeah, he looks just like Tim.

1:01:25.268 --> 1:01:26.853
Yeah. You look like Tim.

1:01:26.895 --> 1:01:29.064
-(coughs)
-Hmm? -Huh?

1:01:29.105 --> 1:01:30.607
Except Tim didn't wear glasses.

1:01:30.648 --> 1:01:32.776
Oh, that's right.
(scoffs)

1:01:32.817 --> 1:01:35.278
Huh. Well, how about that.

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:37.864
-(Tina sighs)
-Hey, where is Tim, anyway?

1:01:37.906 --> 1:01:39.699
Tim and Ted are on a trip.

1:01:39.741 --> 1:01:41.910
-TED SR. and JANICE: Together?
-They're bonding.

1:01:41.951 --> 1:01:43.995
-Well, that's about time.
-Yeah.

1:01:44.037 --> 1:01:46.206
I just hope Tim's back
in time for the pageant.

1:01:46.247 --> 1:01:47.707
-(Janice scoffs)
-(Ted Sr. chuckles)

1:01:47.749 --> 1:01:50.669
Uh, why...
why wouldn't he be there?

1:01:50.710 --> 1:01:52.712
-(laughs) Tim Time.
-Tim Time.

1:01:52.754 --> 1:01:53.755
-JANICE: Oh. (chuckles)
-(Carol laughs)

1:01:53.797 --> 1:01:54.881
What's-what's Tim Time?

1:01:54.923 --> 1:01:56.383
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1:01:56.424 --> 1:02:00.345
Well, Marcos, Tim Time
is like a black hole

1:02:00.387 --> 1:02:04.808
where things like reality
and being on time get lost.

1:02:04.849 --> 1:02:06.267
-(Tabitha laughs)
-Oh.

1:02:06.309 --> 1:02:09.062
Tabitha's father has
a very active imagination.

1:02:09.104 --> 1:02:10.814
Which is a good thing.

1:02:10.855 --> 1:02:12.524
Yeah, that's a...
I'd say that's a good thing.

1:02:12.565 --> 1:02:15.902
Oh, remember when he said our
boss was trying to kidnap us?

1:02:15.944 --> 1:02:17.445
-He did?
-(laughter)

1:02:17.487 --> 1:02:20.031
TED SR.: Or that his baby
brother could walk and talk

1:02:20.073 --> 1:02:21.700
but only when
we weren't looking.

1:02:21.741 --> 1:02:23.034
(laughter)

1:02:23.076 --> 1:02:24.953
<i>("William Tell</i>Overture"
playing)

1:02:24.994 --> 1:02:27.831
(chuckling):
Wow. Turn around.

1:02:29.374 --> 1:02:31.042
TABITHA:
That's so Dad.

1:02:31.084 --> 1:02:33.753
You know, Ted was
quite a handful himself.

1:02:33.795 --> 1:02:36.089
-Oh, he could be very...
-TED SR.: Uptight.

1:02:36.131 --> 1:02:37.882
JANICE:
Mm. Yes. High-strung.

1:02:37.924 --> 1:02:40.301
Oh. Remember the time
he sued us?

1:02:40.343 --> 1:02:43.054
-(laughter)
-JANICE: Teenagers. Ugh.

1:02:43.096 --> 1:02:45.306
He really looked up
to his big brother, though.

1:02:45.348 --> 1:02:47.475
-BOTH: He did?
-JANICE: Oh, yeah.

1:02:47.517 --> 1:02:49.310
He wouldn't leave him alone.

1:02:49.352 --> 1:02:50.937
Everything Tim did,
Teddy wanted to do.

1:02:50.979 --> 1:02:52.480
-TABITHA: Really?
-Yeah.

1:02:52.522 --> 1:02:54.607
-Tagalong Teddy, we called him.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1:02:54.649 --> 1:02:56.776
-JANICE: Well, not to his face.
-TED SR.: No, no.

1:02:56.818 --> 1:02:59.029
Not to his face.
He was very litigious.

1:02:59.070 --> 1:03:01.281
But you know what?
Your dad didn't mind.

1:03:01.322 --> 1:03:03.324
He was so proud
of his little brother.

1:03:03.366 --> 1:03:05.160
-Oh, yeah.
-He loved showing him off.

1:03:05.201 --> 1:03:07.871
TED SR.: Those guys did
everything together.

1:03:07.912 --> 1:03:09.956
JANICE:
They were best friends.

1:03:09.998 --> 1:03:11.708
-Just like you and me.
-(Tina giggling)

1:03:11.750 --> 1:03:13.460
Right, Tina?

1:03:13.501 --> 1:03:14.794
Best friends forever.

1:03:14.836 --> 1:03:16.129
-Tickle monster!
-(Carol chuckles)

1:03:16.171 --> 1:03:18.298
CAROL:
That's so sweet.

1:03:26.014 --> 1:03:27.474
TABITHA:
And this is my closet.

1:03:27.515 --> 1:03:29.309
-TIM: Oh, cool closet.
-And this is my bed.

1:03:29.351 --> 1:03:31.269
-And this is my fish.
-(tapping)

1:03:31.311 --> 1:03:35.023
-Hey, want to see something
really, really cool? -Sure.

1:03:36.024 --> 1:03:37.984
I made this vocalizer
for Dr. Hawking.

1:03:38.026 --> 1:03:39.778
Hey, my old...

1:03:39.819 --> 1:03:41.738
-What did you do?!
-Check this out.

1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:43.907
Say hello, Dr. Hawking.

1:03:44.824 --> 1:03:46.826
ROBOTIC VOICE:
Hell-l-l-l-l...

1:03:46.868 --> 1:03:50.497
(grunts)
Um, he has performance anxiety.

1:03:50.538 --> 1:03:51.915
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1:03:51.956 --> 1:03:53.583
Oh, this is Lamb Lamb.

1:03:53.625 --> 1:03:55.126
Hey, Lamb Lamb.

1:03:55.168 --> 1:03:57.837
That's my galaxy model
right up there on my shelf.

1:03:57.879 --> 1:04:00.048
My scientist of the week award.

1:04:00.090 --> 1:04:01.925
-Wow.
-My geode rock collection.

1:04:01.966 --> 1:04:03.510
And my telescope.

1:04:03.551 --> 1:04:04.678
Sweet.

1:04:04.719 --> 1:04:07.013
-Hey, cool guitar.
-Yeah.

1:04:07.055 --> 1:04:08.056
That's my dad's.

1:04:08.098 --> 1:04:09.933
Cool dad. (grunts)

1:04:09.974 --> 1:04:11.226
Are you okay?

1:04:11.267 --> 1:04:13.520
Yeah, I'm a lot taller
in my mind.

1:04:13.561 --> 1:04:16.731
Hey, if you want,
I can help you with your song.

1:04:16.773 --> 1:04:19.025
No, you can't.

1:04:19.067 --> 1:04:20.694
-Your ears will bleed.
-Oh, please.

1:04:20.735 --> 1:04:22.362
It'll be fun.

1:04:22.404 --> 1:04:24.948
How about this one?
It's a classic.

1:04:24.989 --> 1:04:27.033
(sighs)
Do we have to?

1:04:27.075 --> 1:04:29.369
Come on. Let's try.

1:04:30.370 --> 1:04:32.122
Okay.

1:04:33.164 --> 1:04:34.749
It's not gonna be good, though.

1:04:34.791 --> 1:04:35.917
No judgment.

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:37.460
We're just having fun.

1:04:37.502 --> 1:04:39.587
(playing gentle melody)

1:04:42.424 --> 1:04:46.469
(off-key):
* There's no place like home *

1:04:46.511 --> 1:04:48.638
* For the holidays *

1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:50.598
ROBOTIC VOICE:
Please stop.

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:54.227
-No, stop. Aah...!
-* 'Cause no matter *

1:04:54.269 --> 1:04:56.896
* How far away you roam... *

1:04:56.938 --> 1:04:58.314
(stops playing)

1:04:58.356 --> 1:05:00.066
Good... try.

1:05:00.108 --> 1:05:02.736
Ugh! I just get so nervous.

1:05:02.777 --> 1:05:04.738
(chuckles):
That's okay.

1:05:04.779 --> 1:05:07.240
Listen, all you got to do

1:05:07.282 --> 1:05:10.243
is imagine that
you're inside the song.

1:05:10.285 --> 1:05:14.080
Everything in the lyrics
is actually happening to you.

1:05:14.122 --> 1:05:17.250
And you can see the notes.

1:05:17.292 --> 1:05:20.211
(playing "If You Want
to Sing Out, Sing Out")

1:05:22.130 --> 1:05:25.800
TIM: * Well, if you want
to sing out, sing out *

1:05:25.842 --> 1:05:29.387
* And if you want
to be free, be free *

1:05:29.429 --> 1:05:32.766
-Wow. Whoa! -* 'Cause there's
a million things to be *

1:05:32.807 --> 1:05:35.435
-* You know that there are *
-Whoa. Marcos, wait up.

1:05:35.477 --> 1:05:37.187
-Come on.
-(grunts)

1:05:37.228 --> 1:05:39.439
-* And if you want to sing
high, sing high * -(whimpering)

1:05:39.481 --> 1:05:41.441
-That's a little too high.
-* And if you want *

1:05:41.483 --> 1:05:43.443
-* To sing low, sing low *
-Whoa.

1:05:43.485 --> 1:05:45.111
I got you.

1:05:45.153 --> 1:05:47.364
-* 'Cause there's a million
ways to go * -(gasps)

1:05:47.405 --> 1:05:49.115
* You know that there are *

1:05:49.157 --> 1:05:50.533
OMG, that's a lot.

1:05:50.575 --> 1:05:51.659
(screams)

1:05:51.701 --> 1:05:54.496
* Uh-huh, it's easy *

1:05:54.537 --> 1:05:56.998
-* Uh-huh *
-(screams, laughs)

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:59.626
* You only need to try *

1:05:59.668 --> 1:06:01.419
(screams, laughs)

1:06:01.461 --> 1:06:03.338
(yelling)

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:05.548
* You can sing what you want *

1:06:05.590 --> 1:06:07.175
Whoo! Yeah, this is fun!

1:06:07.217 --> 1:06:10.387
-* The opportunity's yours *
-(whooping)

1:06:10.428 --> 1:06:13.473
* And if you do it your way *

1:06:13.515 --> 1:06:14.808
Whoa.

1:06:14.849 --> 1:06:17.143
* You can do it today *

1:06:17.185 --> 1:06:20.021
Marcos, wait. Where are you?

1:06:20.063 --> 1:06:21.648
Come on. You can do it.

1:06:21.690 --> 1:06:24.526
-I can't. I can't.
-(audience cheering)

1:06:24.567 --> 1:06:27.153

1:06:27.195 --> 1:06:28.321
(gasps softly)

1:06:28.363 --> 1:06:30.156
(audience murmuring quietly)

1:06:30.198 --> 1:06:32.450
(panting nervously)

1:06:33.702 --> 1:06:36.996
-Now go for it.
-(audience chattering)

1:06:37.038 --> 1:06:38.832
-* Ah-ah-ah *
-(chatter stops)

1:06:38.873 --> 1:06:41.084
* *

1:06:41.126 --> 1:06:43.628
Whoa. (chuckles)

1:06:46.381 --> 1:06:47.549
Hey.

1:06:47.590 --> 1:06:49.634
* It's easy *

1:06:49.676 --> 1:06:51.052
* Ah-ah-ah *

1:06:51.094 --> 1:06:54.681
* You only need to try *

1:06:54.723 --> 1:06:56.433
TABITHA:
All right. My turn.

1:06:56.474 --> 1:06:58.393
TIM:
Here we go. It's all you.

1:06:58.435 --> 1:07:01.354
* Well, if I want
to sing out, sing out *

1:07:01.396 --> 1:07:03.064
-* Sing out *
-Yes, let it out.

1:07:03.106 --> 1:07:04.983
* And if I want
to be free, be free *

1:07:05.025 --> 1:07:06.359
* Be free *

1:07:06.401 --> 1:07:08.570
* 'Cause there's
a million things to be *

1:07:08.611 --> 1:07:10.947
* I know that there are,
I know that there are *

1:07:10.989 --> 1:07:13.408
-* I know that there are *
-* You know that there are *

1:07:13.450 --> 1:07:16.369
-* I know that there are... *

1:07:16.411 --> 1:07:19.956
-* I know that there are *
-* You know that there are *

1:07:19.998 --> 1:07:24.085
* I know that there are. *

1:07:27.756 --> 1:07:30.133
Wow. That was so great.

1:07:30.175 --> 1:07:31.676
No, you were so great.

1:07:31.718 --> 1:07:32.844
Thanks, Marcos.

1:07:32.886 --> 1:07:34.262
-(camera clicks)
-What?

1:07:34.304 --> 1:07:35.722
-Oh, that's a keeper.
-Oh, they can see us.

1:07:35.764 --> 1:07:36.931
-They can see us.
-Aw.

1:07:36.973 --> 1:07:38.224
Guys, come on.

1:07:38.266 --> 1:07:40.393
Stop. No, do it. Do it.

1:07:40.435 --> 1:07:42.354
(chuckling):
Oh, no.

1:07:42.395 --> 1:07:44.647
Parents, right? (chuckles)

1:07:44.689 --> 1:07:46.900
-Bye, Templeton family!
-CAROL: Bye-bye.

1:07:46.941 --> 1:07:48.568
-Bye, Marcos.
-Lightspeed.

1:07:48.610 --> 1:07:49.611
Weird kid.

1:07:49.652 --> 1:07:51.321
JANICE:
Yeah, I don't like him.

1:07:51.363 --> 1:07:53.698
(guitar playing softly)

1:07:53.740 --> 1:07:56.326
* Catch my eye *

1:07:57.118 --> 1:07:59.788
* Take my hand *

1:08:00.622 --> 1:08:02.290
* This bond is tighter
than we *

1:08:02.332 --> 1:08:04.000
You go get 'em, Tabitha.

1:08:04.042 --> 1:08:06.169
* Ever planned *

1:08:06.211 --> 1:08:09.047
* Give me courage *

1:08:09.089 --> 1:08:10.674
* So I can land... *

Don't they understand
it's the fate of the world?

1:08:18.306 --> 1:08:20.350
I've been on hold forever!

1:08:20.392 --> 1:08:22.435
CHILD: All operators
are currently napping.

1:08:22.477 --> 1:08:24.979
I've been on hold so long
I got a tooth growing in.

1:08:25.021 --> 1:08:27.440
Back in my day, we wrote memos.

1:08:27.482 --> 1:08:29.067
That's cute and old-timey.

1:08:29.109 --> 1:08:30.402

1:08:30.443 --> 1:08:32.445
TED:
I weep for the future.

1:08:32.487 --> 1:08:34.948
Do you want to talk about your
feelings now while I'm on hold?

1:08:34.989 --> 1:08:36.116
I can give you 20 minutes.

1:08:36.157 --> 1:08:37.409
No.

1:08:37.450 --> 1:08:39.035
Let's get to the nut,
the nugget.

1:08:39.077 --> 1:08:40.537
What are you afraid of?

1:08:40.578 --> 1:08:42.997
Sharks, getting shot
in the head with an arrow,

1:08:43.039 --> 1:08:44.416
and... the IRS.

1:08:44.457 --> 1:08:45.959
-That's it.
-There you go.

1:08:46.001 --> 1:08:47.460
Was that so hard?
Baby steps.

1:08:47.502 --> 1:08:49.462
Now, what about being lonely?

1:08:49.504 --> 1:08:51.339
-I'm not lonely.
-Mm-hmm.

1:08:51.381 --> 1:08:53.800
I'm just... alone.

1:08:53.842 --> 1:08:55.301
There's a difference.

1:08:55.343 --> 1:08:56.970
-I think it's time
you read your file. -(gasps)

1:08:57.012 --> 1:08:58.596
-Ah-ah-ah-ah.
-Just give me.

1:08:58.638 --> 1:09:00.015
Whoa. This is it?

1:09:00.056 --> 1:09:02.517
It's so thin.

1:09:02.559 --> 1:09:04.394
YOUNG TIM:
<i>Dear Boss Baby,</i>

1:09:04.436 --> 1:09:06.021
<i>I promise you this:</i>

1:09:06.062 --> 1:09:08.732
<i>Every morning when</i>
<i>you wake up, I will be there.</i>

1:09:08.773 --> 1:09:11.484
<i>Every night at dinner,</i>
<i>I will be there.</i>

1:09:11.526 --> 1:09:13.903
<i>Every birthday party,</i>
<i>every Christmas morning,</i>

1:09:13.945 --> 1:09:15.405

1:09:23.830 --> 1:09:25.707
<i>Always.</i>

1:09:25.749 --> 1:09:28.501
Makes me want to make
a sad face.

1:09:28.543 --> 1:09:30.754
(toy train whistle blows)

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:35.508
We were just kids.

1:09:35.550 --> 1:09:38.094
We didn't know anything
about the real world.

1:09:38.136 --> 1:09:40.638
And eventually,
you have to grow up.

1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:42.891
Just because you grow up,
it doesn't mean

1:09:42.932 --> 1:09:44.434
you have to grow apart.

1:09:44.476 --> 1:09:47.103
I don't know.
Maybe it's already too late.

1:09:47.145 --> 1:09:49.105
TIM (grunting):
Hey.

1:09:49.147 --> 1:09:50.357
Sorry I'm late.

1:09:50.398 --> 1:09:51.941
TINA:
Daddy!

1:09:51.983 --> 1:09:53.151
Daddy, Daddy.

1:09:53.193 --> 1:09:54.402
What's going on?

1:09:54.444 --> 1:09:55.904
Uncle Ted really misses you.

1:09:55.945 --> 1:09:58.281
-Isn't that nice?
-(toy train whistle blows)

1:10:01.076 --> 1:10:03.870
So, hey, uh, what you doing?

1:10:03.912 --> 1:10:05.330
Oh, I was, uh...

1:10:05.372 --> 1:10:08.583
I don't know,
I was just working on this.

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:10.418
(gasps)

1:10:12.837 --> 1:10:15.632
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said at recess.

1:10:15.674 --> 1:10:18.259
What happens on the playground
stays on the playground.

1:10:18.301 --> 1:10:20.178
I was just worried
about Tabitha, you know?

1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:21.554
She's your daughter. I get it.

1:10:21.596 --> 1:10:23.264
This whole time,
I was thinking about

1:10:23.306 --> 1:10:25.642
what I wanted
and not what she needed.

1:10:25.684 --> 1:10:27.811
I think I finally got this
parenting thing figured out.

1:10:27.852 --> 1:10:28.978
Gold star for you, Daddy.

1:10:29.020 --> 1:10:30.647
-Keep it up, Pops.
-Yeah, well, about that.

1:10:30.689 --> 1:10:33.775
Armstrong wants to get rid
of parents somehow.

1:10:33.817 --> 1:10:36.111
-Sorry, what? -He's planning
a baby revolution.

1:10:36.152 --> 1:10:37.654
Ugh, come on.

1:10:37.696 --> 1:10:39.906
Just when I got good
at this whole parenting thing.

1:10:39.948 --> 1:10:41.408
We got to stop him.

1:10:41.449 --> 1:10:42.992
-Not we.
-You?

1:10:43.034 --> 1:10:44.369
Neither one of us.

1:10:44.411 --> 1:10:46.037
-BabyCorp is taking it
from here. -Ah.

1:10:46.079 --> 1:10:48.206
So, what, they're gonna send in
the Baby SEALS or something?

1:10:48.248 --> 1:10:49.749
-Looks like it.
-So you'll, um...

1:10:49.791 --> 1:10:52.127
you'll be headed back
to your office.

1:10:52.168 --> 1:10:54.421
TED: Uh, yeah.
Well, keep in touch, Tim.

1:10:54.462 --> 1:10:56.256
Hello? BabyCorp?

1:10:56.297 --> 1:10:58.258
Thank goodness, BabyCorp.
Well, BabyCo...

1:10:58.299 --> 1:11:00.510
(stammering):
Wha-What? What are you saying,

1:11:00.552 --> 1:11:02.512
there's not enough evidence,
BabyCorp? I...

1:11:02.554 --> 1:11:04.347
-Uh-oh. -So you're not
gonna do anything?

1:11:04.389 --> 1:11:05.765
But, BabyCorp, I...

1:11:05.807 --> 1:11:07.475
Ugh. Well, then
we'll take care of it.

1:11:07.517 --> 1:11:09.269
You know what, BabyCorp?

1:11:09.310 --> 1:11:10.687
I quit!

1:11:10.729 --> 1:11:12.814
What a bunch of
diaper sniffers. (grunts)

1:11:12.856 --> 1:11:14.566
(whistle blows,
train powers down)

1:11:14.607 --> 1:11:16.776
Looks like we have to stop
Armstrong ourselves.

1:11:16.818 --> 1:11:19.362
We're going rogue.
I like it.

1:11:19.404 --> 1:11:21.031
-So the mission's back on?
-Yeah.

1:11:21.072 --> 1:11:23.825
If you two can put up with
each other a little longer.

1:11:23.867 --> 1:11:27.120
I suppose I can live with that.
Tim?

1:11:27.162 --> 1:11:28.121
I think that's doable.

1:11:28.163 --> 1:11:29.122
Yay!

1:11:29.164 --> 1:11:30.582
Forced together again.

1:11:30.623 --> 1:11:33.376
WIZZIE:

TED:
Okay. Our clock is ticking.

1:11:35.503 --> 1:11:38.590
We have to stop Armstrong
before the formula wears off.

1:11:38.631 --> 1:11:42.010
Working as a team,
we will strike at the pageant.

1:11:42.052 --> 1:11:43.303
Go, Tina.

1:11:43.345 --> 1:11:45.638
Now, this top secret
document...

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:47.140
Sweetie, it's the program.

1:11:47.182 --> 1:11:49.476
This top secret program reveals

1:11:49.517 --> 1:11:52.479
that Armstrong is scheduled
to address the audience,

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:55.565
which he will do right here
at the very end.

1:11:55.607 --> 1:11:58.193
We need someone backstage.
Tim, that's you.

1:11:58.234 --> 1:12:00.862
How am I gonna get backstage
if I'm not in the pageant?

1:12:00.904 --> 1:12:02.739
TED: My people will
take care of that.

1:12:02.781 --> 1:12:03.573
(toy squeaks)

1:12:03.615 --> 1:12:04.991
-Ah!
-Thank you.

1:12:05.033 --> 1:12:06.159
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

1:12:06.201 --> 1:12:07.243
-No!
-Great.

1:12:07.285 --> 1:12:09.329
-And... go.
-(laughing)

1:12:09.371 --> 1:12:10.789
Glue.

1:12:10.830 --> 1:12:12.665

1:12:12.707 --> 1:12:15.001
ROBOT VOICE:
There, there. All better.

1:12:15.043 --> 1:12:16.628
Awesome.

1:12:16.670 --> 1:12:20.090
Now, I'll be your eyes
and your ears in the audience.

1:12:20.131 --> 1:12:22.008
I can't let Mommy see me talk,

1:12:22.050 --> 1:12:23.927
or she's gonna start
squealing and hugging me,

1:12:23.968 --> 1:12:25.679
but these little doodads
will let you

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:27.514
understand my baby talk.

1:12:27.555 --> 1:12:29.182
It's called a GAGA device.

1:12:29.224 --> 1:12:30.558
-Aw, that's cute.
-Check it out.

1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:31.851
(speaks gibberish)

1:12:31.893 --> 1:12:33.103
(over GAGA):
Can you hear me, Daddy?

1:12:33.144 --> 1:12:34.354
Also cute.

1:12:34.396 --> 1:12:36.439
Meanwhile,
with my new purple status,

1:12:36.481 --> 1:12:38.483
<i>I can stay close to Armstrong.</i>

1:12:38.525 --> 1:12:40.527
Um, that's-that's an eyebrow.

1:12:40.568 --> 1:12:42.529
-Oh. Sorry.
-Uh, no, that's, uh...

<i>I'll implant a device.</i>

-Got it.
-Got what?

1:12:47.450 --> 1:12:48.618
I mean, you've got this.

1:12:48.660 --> 1:12:50.662
Go get 'em, tiger.
(chuckles)

1:12:50.704 --> 1:12:52.622
-Oh, thank you, parents.
-(applause)

1:12:52.664 --> 1:12:54.040
Thank you. There's the...

1:12:54.082 --> 1:12:56.042
There's the old enthusiasm
I like to see.

1:12:56.084 --> 1:12:58.420
TINA: <i>This will</i>
<i>allow me to control his suit.</i>

1:12:58.461 --> 1:13:01.881
<i>I can make Muttonchops</i>

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:06.177
TINA:
<i>I can make him dance.</i>

1:13:06.219 --> 1:13:07.887
<i>I can make him prance.</i>

<i>-Including exposing himself</i>

1:13:14.394 --> 1:13:16.730
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

1:13:16.771 --> 1:13:19.357
The photos will spread
like a diaper rash.

1:13:19.399 --> 1:13:21.234
Cut to our pizza party.

1:13:21.276 --> 1:13:23.194
Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof!

1:13:23.236 --> 1:13:24.404
Questions?

1:13:24.446 --> 1:13:25.613
After Tabitha sings
her solo, right?

1:13:25.655 --> 1:13:27.115
After Tabitha sings.

1:13:27.157 --> 1:13:30.785
Now we just sit back, relax
and enjoy the show.

1:13:32.037 --> 1:13:33.580
(fanfare playing)

1:13:33.621 --> 1:13:36.082
ARMSTRONG: Welcome, parents,
to our holiday pageant.

1:13:36.124 --> 1:13:39.586
Remember, flash photography
in the auditorium

1:13:39.627 --> 1:13:42.255
is absolutely okay.

1:13:42.297 --> 1:13:45.050
Take a picture. Show your kids
that you love 'em.

1:13:45.091 --> 1:13:46.593
Yippee!

1:13:46.634 --> 1:13:47.969
Come on, Tim.

1:13:48.011 --> 1:13:50.263
-You promised you'd be here.
-(man groans)

1:13:50.305 --> 1:13:51.765
Oh, sorry. This seat is taken.

1:13:51.806 --> 1:13:53.725
-Yep. Sorry.
-Oh, no. (mutters)

1:13:53.767 --> 1:13:55.977
-So sorry. I... Sorry.
-(man grunts, mutters)

1:13:56.019 --> 1:13:58.104
-Sorry! I am so sorry.
-(speaking gibberish)

1:13:58.146 --> 1:14:00.440
(over GAGA): Uncle Teddy,
are you in position?

1:14:00.482 --> 1:14:01.816
The baby's in the cradle.

1:14:01.858 --> 1:14:04.486
-The baby's in the cradle.
-Mmm. (slurping)

1:14:04.527 --> 1:14:06.112
(speaking gibberish)

1:14:06.154 --> 1:14:08.114
(over GAGA):
Papa Bear, can you read me?

1:14:08.156 --> 1:14:09.741
The flake has landed.

1:14:09.783 --> 1:14:11.826
Places! Places, everybody!

1:14:11.868 --> 1:14:13.203
-Here we go. Here we go.
-Oh, my gosh.

1:14:13.244 --> 1:14:15.121
-It's starting. It's starting.
-(sighs) Finally.

1:14:15.163 --> 1:14:16.706
It's starting. It's starting.

1:14:16.748 --> 1:14:17.999
Yay!

1:14:18.041 --> 1:14:20.126
-You're a big pageant guy, huh?
-No, no, no.

1:14:20.168 --> 1:14:22.671
I'm not talking about the show.
I'm talking about B-Day.

1:14:23.505 --> 1:14:24.881
B-Day?

1:14:24.923 --> 1:14:27.258
Oh, yeah. It's already
in the parents' phones.

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:29.010
(coughs)

1:14:29.052 --> 1:14:30.804
I taught babies to code.

1:14:30.845 --> 1:14:33.515
TED:
Apps. They're writing apps.

1:14:33.556 --> 1:14:35.725
But my next app...

1:14:35.767 --> 1:14:39.312
ooh, it's gonna change
the world forever.

1:14:39.354 --> 1:14:43.983
QT Snap is the app that's going
to change the world forever?

1:14:44.025 --> 1:14:46.986
Forever starts today.
(chuckles)

1:14:47.028 --> 1:14:49.030
Uh, cool. (gasps)

1:14:57.247 --> 1:14:58.832
* It's the best time of year *

1:14:58.873 --> 1:15:00.750
* But due to ice caps melting *

1:15:00.792 --> 1:15:02.836
* Global warming's here *

1:15:02.877 --> 1:15:04.671
* It feels like summer *

1:15:04.713 --> 1:15:06.673
* The snow has disappeared *

1:15:06.715 --> 1:15:08.341
* It's all our parents' fault *

1:15:08.383 --> 1:15:11.261
-* So we're all doomed *
-TIM: * All, uh... *

1:15:11.302 --> 1:15:12.721
* Doomed. *

1:15:12.762 --> 1:15:14.347
This is kind of dark.

1:15:14.389 --> 1:15:15.682
Did the kids just say
we're doomed?

1:15:15.724 --> 1:15:17.684
What the heck are we watching?

1:15:17.726 --> 1:15:19.769
-(camera clicks)
-(yelps)

1:15:19.811 --> 1:15:21.521
Their brains are
turning to mush.

1:15:21.563 --> 1:15:23.064
Months of hypnotic research
embedded

1:15:23.106 --> 1:15:25.900
in the most user-friendly
photo app ever made.

1:15:25.942 --> 1:15:27.527
Ooh.

1:15:27.569 --> 1:15:29.612
Now all we need to do
is sit back, relax

1:15:29.654 --> 1:15:31.364
and enjoy the show.

1:15:31.406 --> 1:15:32.741
-WOMAN: Hey!
-Right.

1:15:32.782 --> 1:15:34.909

-And Hanukkah!

1:15:52.635 --> 1:15:53.928
Your son is so talented.

1:15:53.970 --> 1:15:56.222
-Oh, so is yours.
-Liars.

1:15:56.264 --> 1:15:58.725
Tina, come in.
B-Day is happening now.

1:15:58.767 --> 1:16:00.268
It's all in the phones.

1:16:00.310 --> 1:16:03.271
Armstrong is using an app
to brainwash the parents.

(over GAGA):
Okay, okay. Uh, there's a...

1:16:09.194 --> 1:16:11.696
there's a big old
no-touchy switch backstage.

1:16:11.738 --> 1:16:13.073
(speaking gibberish)

1:16:13.114 --> 1:16:14.741

we have to pull the plug.

1:16:14.783 --> 1:16:16.993
Daddy, come in.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

1:16:17.035 --> 1:16:18.411
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

Ugh. He's not responding.

1:16:20.413 --> 1:16:21.706

Of course not.

1:16:21.748 --> 1:16:23.875
-I'll do it myself.
-Stop!

-Theater kids only.

Don't you worry, okay?

1:16:37.889 --> 1:16:39.766
You're gonna be great.

1:16:39.808 --> 1:16:42.060
Thanks, Marcos.
And thanks for all your help.

1:16:42.102 --> 1:16:43.186
Anytime.

1:16:43.228 --> 1:16:45.271
I feel like you really
understand me.

1:16:45.313 --> 1:16:46.940
I'm so excited.

1:16:46.981 --> 1:16:50.735
I can't wait to see the look
on my dad's face when I sing.

MEGHAN:
Hey! You're on, Templeton!

Armstrong's turning
the parents into zombies

1:17:22.183 --> 1:17:23.852

whatever he wants.

What's that supposed to mean?

1:17:38.199 --> 1:17:39.826
You didn't even come
to my graduation.

1:17:39.868 --> 1:17:41.286
Ow! Which one?

1:17:41.327 --> 1:17:43.747
Business school, law school.
None of them.

You didn't even come
to my wedding.

-Which one?
-I only had one!

1:17:47.292 --> 1:17:48.918
We had a deal, Tim.

You promised
you'd be there always.

Nothing's gonna ruin my B-Day.

1:18:05.602 --> 1:18:08.146
Not even you.

1:18:08.188 --> 1:18:10.023
-Oh, busted.
-Yeah, it was obvious

1:18:10.065 --> 1:18:11.649
from the very, very beginning

1:18:11.691 --> 1:18:14.319
that you two were
working together.

1:18:14.361 --> 1:18:15.737
What gave us away?

1:18:15.779 --> 1:18:18.031
Well, I'd say the bickering,

1:18:18.073 --> 1:18:19.866
the, uh, petty disputes,

1:18:19.908 --> 1:18:21.534
the jealousy.

1:18:21.576 --> 1:18:24.704
You know, you two are brothers
in every single way.

Not the Box. Not now.

1:18:30.794 --> 1:18:32.379
Please.

1:18:32.420 --> 1:18:34.381
Aw, it's just... it's too bad
that you're never gonna

1:18:34.422 --> 1:18:36.549
have a chance to reboot
your relationship and...

1:18:36.591 --> 1:18:38.510
-No!
-...and restore the closeness

1:18:38.551 --> 1:18:39.886

1:19:02.450 --> 1:19:04.786
You had one job to do.

1:19:04.828 --> 1:19:06.788
One job.

1:19:06.830 --> 1:19:08.790
-Oh, no.
-The fountain.

1:19:08.832 --> 1:19:10.458
It's flooding the room.

1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:11.835
This isn't a time-out.

* This bond is tighter
than we ever planned *

1:19:50.498 --> 1:19:52.834
* Give me courage *

1:19:52.876 --> 1:19:55.295
* So I can land *

1:19:55.337 --> 1:19:58.840

divided we'll fall *

-* The world looks so good
through our eyes * -Wow.

1:20:14.397 --> 1:20:19.361
* Like the moon
and stars at night *

1:20:20.987 --> 1:20:23.031
You're right. I blew it.

1:20:23.073 --> 1:20:25.158
I ruined the mission.
(sighs)

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:27.077
And I'm a terrible father.

1:20:27.118 --> 1:20:30.080
Hey, you did sort of
ruin the mission.

1:20:30.121 --> 1:20:31.706
But you're a great dad.

1:20:31.748 --> 1:20:33.166
No, I'm not.

1:20:33.208 --> 1:20:34.793
I could never do your job.

1:20:34.834 --> 1:20:36.378
I mean, you work
around the clock,

1:20:36.419 --> 1:20:38.088
you can't even quit
if you wanted to,

1:20:38.129 --> 1:20:39.714
and you don't even get paid.

1:20:39.756 --> 1:20:42.092
Frankly, I don't see
how that's legal.

1:20:42.133 --> 1:20:44.260
I was always jealous of you.

1:20:44.302 --> 1:20:46.721
I wanted to be successful,
too, you know.

1:20:46.763 --> 1:20:48.056
Sure, Tim.

1:20:48.098 --> 1:20:50.433
I made a lot of money...

1:20:50.475 --> 1:20:52.560
but you made a family.

1:20:53.645 --> 1:20:55.689
The truth is...

1:20:55.730 --> 1:20:57.649
it's lonely at the top.

1:21:00.985 --> 1:21:03.697
* Reach with me *

1:21:03.738 --> 1:21:07.033
* See the sky *

1:21:07.075 --> 1:21:11.788
* I'll always be here
for the rest of your life *

1:21:11.830 --> 1:21:14.791
* Sail that ocean *

1:21:14.833 --> 1:21:17.210
* Find that sand *

1:21:17.252 --> 1:21:20.797
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

1:21:20.839 --> 1:21:24.843
* So together we stand *

1:21:24.884 --> 1:21:27.095
(kids vocalizing)

1:21:30.265 --> 1:21:34.185
You know, I'm... I'm sorry we
don't see each other anymore.

1:21:34.227 --> 1:21:36.229
A very wise person
once told me,

1:21:36.271 --> 1:21:38.064
just because you grow up

1:21:38.106 --> 1:21:40.066
doesn't mean
you have to grow apart.

1:21:40.108 --> 1:21:41.609
-Was it Tina?
-Oh, yeah.

1:21:41.651 --> 1:21:44.571
(laughing): Oh, it is crazy
how smart she is.

1:21:44.612 --> 1:21:46.823
It's like she looks
right into your soul.

1:21:46.865 --> 1:21:49.743
I'm sorry that I missed
your graduations.

1:21:49.784 --> 1:21:52.454
I'm sorry I missed
your one wedding.

1:21:52.495 --> 1:21:55.749
BOTH: I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

1:21:55.790 --> 1:21:58.668
* Side by side *

1:21:58.710 --> 1:22:01.338
* Hand in hand *

1:22:01.379 --> 1:22:06.217
* We speak a language
no one else can understand *

1:22:06.259 --> 1:22:09.179
-* Hear those cheers *
-(cameras clicking)

1:22:09.220 --> 1:22:11.473
* Strike up the band *

1:22:11.514 --> 1:22:15.977
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

1:22:16.019 --> 1:22:23.193
* So together we stand. *

1:22:25.862 --> 1:22:27.030
(chuckles)

1:22:27.072 --> 1:22:29.115
(panting)

1:22:32.744 --> 1:22:34.746
(pants, whimpers)

1:22:34.788 --> 1:22:37.165
(one person clapping)

1:22:38.875 --> 1:22:41.503
(hyperventilating)

1:22:41.544 --> 1:22:43.797
(crying)

1:22:43.838 --> 1:22:45.840
Oh, Tabitha.

1:22:45.882 --> 1:22:47.300
(gasps) Gramps?

1:22:47.342 --> 1:22:49.010
Nana? Mom?

1:22:49.052 --> 1:22:50.178
Oh, no!

1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:52.097
-(grunts)
-Oh, my gosh, Tabitha.

1:22:52.138 --> 1:22:53.973
You did such a great job.

1:22:54.015 --> 1:22:57.227
Well, that's just
horribly rude of you all.

1:22:57.268 --> 1:22:58.561
Come on, everybody.

1:22:58.603 --> 1:23:02.440
Uh, how about
a standing ovation?

1:23:02.482 --> 1:23:05.402
-(laughs) Very good.
-(Tina gasps)

1:23:05.443 --> 1:23:07.028
They're zombies!

1:23:07.070 --> 1:23:08.738
We did it!

1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:12.659
-The baby revolution has begun.
-(babies cheering, laughing)

1:23:12.701 --> 1:23:14.994
No more need for costumes.

1:23:15.036 --> 1:23:16.913
(yells, laughs)

1:23:16.955 --> 1:23:19.124
Who wants cake?

1:23:20.041 --> 1:23:21.501
Oh, my gosh.

1:23:21.543 --> 1:23:24.087
ARMSTRONG:
Happy B-Day, everybody.

1:23:24.129 --> 1:23:26.131
Daddy, Uncle Ted.

1:23:26.172 --> 1:23:27.716
Come in. Where are you?

1:23:27.757 --> 1:23:30.051

1:23:38.101 --> 1:23:40.061
TINA:
Here you go, sis.

1:23:40.103 --> 1:23:42.605
Now, I already used this,
so I know it's safe.

1:23:42.647 --> 1:23:44.399
Thanks.

1:23:45.775 --> 1:23:48.319
Wait. Are you t-talking?

1:23:48.361 --> 1:23:50.321
(chuckling): I know.
It's pretty weird, isn't it?

1:23:50.363 --> 1:23:52.574
(screams)
Oh, my gosh, you're talking!

1:23:52.615 --> 1:23:54.034
It's an emergency.

1:23:54.075 --> 1:23:56.369
I'm on a supersecret mission
from BabyCorp.

1:23:56.411 --> 1:23:57.370
(gasps)

1:23:57.412 --> 1:23:59.789
You mean Dad's stories
are true?

1:23:59.831 --> 1:24:01.708
That's what the suit says.

1:24:01.750 --> 1:24:02.917
How do I look?

1:24:02.959 --> 1:24:04.336
No way!

1:24:04.377 --> 1:24:06.379
Now, I can't get ahold
of Dad or Uncle Ted,

1:24:06.421 --> 1:24:08.298
so I need your help, big sis.

1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:09.924
Wait, wait.
Dad's here?

1:24:09.966 --> 1:24:11.426
They've been here
the whole time.

1:24:11.468 --> 1:24:13.386
-Where? -I don't have
much time to explain,

1:24:13.428 --> 1:24:15.764
but Dr. Armstrong is a baby.

1:24:15.805 --> 1:24:17.724
A very bad, bad baby.

1:24:17.766 --> 1:24:21.603
Soon, the world is
gonna be our playground.

1:24:21.644 --> 1:24:24.064
-Whee! (grunts) -("Push It"
by Salt-N-Pepa playing)

1:24:24.105 --> 1:24:25.440
(laughs)

1:24:25.482 --> 1:24:27.817
Now we can make parents
do whatever we want.

1:24:27.859 --> 1:24:29.944
Awesome! Yeah!

1:24:29.986 --> 1:24:32.906
No more rules.

1:24:32.947 --> 1:24:35.617
Sayonara, Mama and Papa.

1:24:35.658 --> 1:24:36.951
Yeah.

1:24:36.993 --> 1:24:38.078
(babies laughing)

1:24:38.119 --> 1:24:39.412
-Mom?
-Dad?

1:24:39.454 --> 1:24:40.413
Grandpa?

1:24:40.455 --> 1:24:42.123
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

1:24:42.165 --> 1:24:44.250
We need to shut it down
before it goes global.

1:24:44.292 --> 1:24:46.419
-ARMSTRONG: Yeah. (laughs)
-What are we gonna do?

1:24:46.461 --> 1:24:48.672
Okay, we need to find
the big whatchamacallit

1:24:48.713 --> 1:24:50.298
that controls
the parents' phones.

1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:51.841
-The server.
-Yes. Yes.

1:24:51.883 --> 1:24:54.010
Is there a big one
of those whatsits at school?

1:24:54.052 --> 1:24:55.595
Uh, let's see.

1:24:55.637 --> 1:24:58.765
Well, servers get really hot,
so you need air ducts.

1:24:58.807 --> 1:25:00.100
TINA:
Now you're thinking!

1:25:00.141 --> 1:25:02.310
TABITHA:
Which intersect at the acorn!

1:25:02.352 --> 1:25:04.646
-A-plus!
-Come on.

-This way.
-(gasps)

1:25:06.147 --> 1:25:08.358
Opportunity knocks.

1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:10.944
First, we need to make
a quick pit stop.

1:25:10.985 --> 1:25:14.280
AUTOMATED VOICE (distorted):
Your time has concluded.

1:25:14.322 --> 1:25:16.449
-(both panting)
-It looks like this is it, Tim.

1:25:16.491 --> 1:25:18.785
Well, hey, at least we have

1:25:18.827 --> 1:25:22.455
these last final
precious moments together.

1:25:23.665 --> 1:25:25.875
Precious. Precious!

That's my girl.

1:26:04.039 --> 1:26:05.165
Thank you.

1:26:07.208 --> 1:26:08.418

1:26:08.460 --> 1:26:09.836
Tina, Tina, come in.
It's Daddy.

1:26:09.878 --> 1:26:12.213
Daddy! Listen, we have
to shut down the server.

1:26:12.255 --> 1:26:14.007
-It's in the acorn.
-Whoa.

1:26:14.049 --> 1:26:15.675
This is so weird.

1:26:15.717 --> 1:26:16.968
I call shotgun.

Quick, to the acorn!

Glue! (laughs)

1:26:36.071 --> 1:26:38.531
Yah! Pixie dust! Aha.

CREEPY GIRL:

Oh, no.
It's about to go worldwide.

And yet, uh, annoying.

1:27:33.378 --> 1:27:35.588
Quite annoying. Yeah.

1:27:35.630 --> 1:27:38.174
I'm gonna have to,

1:27:54.315 --> 1:27:55.734
-We could have been partners.
-(groaning)

1:27:55.775 --> 1:27:57.610
I've got something better
than a partner.

1:27:57.652 --> 1:27:59.696
-I have a brother.
-Yeah!

1:27:59.738 --> 1:28:01.906

1:28:16.546 --> 1:28:18.465
-That's really Dad?
-Yep.

1:28:18.506 --> 1:28:20.675
I said a lot of stuff
to that kid.

Well, quite the family reunion.

Mommy and Daddy,
let's hug 'em-- to death.

1:28:31.686 --> 1:28:33.563
Oh, don't worry about us.
Get to the server.

Stick around.

Uh, Tim, what do we do now?!

1:28:51.748 --> 1:28:53.667
Don't move.
Maybe they won't see us.

TED:
They see us, Tim. They see us.

1:28:55.377 --> 1:28:56.711

Oh. Hey, that's a little
too high now.

Look straight ahead, okay?

1:29:06.429 --> 1:29:08.181
Can I give you a hand?

1:29:08.223 --> 1:29:09.474
Of course,
I mean that facetiously,

1:29:09.516 --> 1:29:12.185
because the hand acts as a...
as a key.

1:29:12.227 --> 1:29:13.520
No, no. No, no, no.

1:29:13.561 --> 1:29:15.230
-Hey, hey. No, no, no, no.
-Thanks, sis.

1:29:15.271 --> 1:29:17.524
(grunts)
Stay away from my server.

1:29:17.565 --> 1:29:19.025
-(yells)
-(grunts)

1:29:19.067 --> 1:29:20.527
-Shut it down, Tabitha.
-What are you doing?

1:29:20.568 --> 1:29:22.445
What are you doing?
No, no, no! No!

1:29:22.487 --> 1:29:24.197
Don't do that.

1:29:24.239 --> 1:29:25.573
-Oh, no!
-(zombielike grunting)

1:29:25.615 --> 1:29:27.200
-Hugs.
-Hug Grandpa.

1:29:27.242 --> 1:29:28.785
It's <i>Night of</i>
<i>the Living Boomers.</i>

1:29:28.827 --> 1:29:31.871
-Dad, stop! (screams)
-ADULTS: Hugs.

1:29:31.913 --> 1:29:32.956
(yells)

1:29:32.997 --> 1:29:34.374
(grunts, gasps)

1:29:34.416 --> 1:29:36.543
(groans) Back.
Back, you little monsters.

1:29:36.584 --> 1:29:38.962
-You back off, candy pants.
-(yells, grunts)

1:29:39.004 --> 1:29:40.130
(screams)

1:29:40.171 --> 1:29:42.215
Ha! Got your nose.

1:29:42.257 --> 1:29:43.591
(grunting)

1:29:43.633 --> 1:29:46.052
Oh, right in the breadbasket!

1:29:46.094 --> 1:29:48.221
(both grunting rapidly)

1:29:48.263 --> 1:29:50.932
(both babbling)

1:29:53.518 --> 1:29:54.769
-Ow!
-Ha!

1:29:54.811 --> 1:29:56.229
-Knocked his block off.
-Ah, poopy.

1:29:56.271 --> 1:29:58.064
Tina, I think I got it. Yes!

1:29:58.106 --> 1:30:00.233
Don't hit that button.
Don't hit that button. Aah!

1:30:00.275 --> 1:30:02.068
Ow! Ooh!

1:30:02.110 --> 1:30:04.779
-And... enter.

1:30:06.865 --> 1:30:09.617
-Look what you made me do.
-(gasps) The fire alarm.

1:30:09.659 --> 1:30:11.411
-ARMSTRONG: Darn it.
-TABITHA: Dad!

1:30:11.453 --> 1:30:13.788
Uncle Ted!
Pull the fire alarm!

1:30:13.830 --> 1:30:15.415
-The girls need help.
-TED: No kissies!

1:30:15.457 --> 1:30:17.709
The girls need us. (grunts)

1:30:17.751 --> 1:30:20.545
-(alarm ringing)
-(grunts) Time's up, halflings.

1:30:20.587 --> 1:30:23.590
(sputters)
Great galloping gargoyles!

1:30:23.631 --> 1:30:27.093
-(Ted screaming)
-WIZZIE: What? What?

1:30:27.135 --> 1:30:29.346
Tim! Get to the fire alarm!

1:30:29.387 --> 1:30:30.805
I'll hold them back.

1:30:30.847 --> 1:30:33.099
TED:
Make it rain, baby.

1:30:33.141 --> 1:30:34.434
TIM:
I'm on it.

1:30:34.476 --> 1:30:35.894
What's the matter?

1:30:35.935 --> 1:30:37.479
(voice cracks): You can't
handle the awkward phase?

1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:38.605
(whimpering)

1:30:38.646 --> 1:30:40.982
Go, Marcos... uh, Dad. Go!

1:30:41.024 --> 1:30:42.484
-(gasps)
-I'm back!

1:30:42.525 --> 1:30:43.985
-Here we go.
-Come on.

1:30:44.027 --> 1:30:46.112
How about another round,
you tough guy? Come on!

1:30:46.154 --> 1:30:47.530
Ow. Stop it.

1:30:47.572 --> 1:30:48.948
I still got these.
(grunting)

1:30:48.990 --> 1:30:50.617
TABITHA:
You put my sister down.

1:30:50.658 --> 1:30:53.828
B-Day will happen,
whether you like it or not.

1:30:53.870 --> 1:30:56.122
-You shall not pass!
-(zombielike murmuring)

1:30:56.164 --> 1:30:58.041
Uh, you shall not pass.

1:30:58.083 --> 1:30:59.751
No! Stop passing.

1:30:59.793 --> 1:31:01.461
-(grunts)

1:31:01.503 --> 1:31:02.712
Yeah, Dad!

-(alarm stops)
-(Tabitha gasps)

1:31:06.341 --> 1:31:07.884
TABITHA:
That's it?

1:31:07.926 --> 1:31:10.178
That's right. Why? What?
The school's expensive.

1:31:10.220 --> 1:31:13.306
-I had to cut costs someplace.
-(both grunt)

1:31:13.348 --> 1:31:14.474
Oh, no. It's not working.

1:31:14.516 --> 1:31:15.642
Did you pull it right?

1:31:15.684 --> 1:31:16.976
How else you gonna pull it?

1:31:17.018 --> 1:31:19.020
ARMSTRONG (laughs):
You'll see I'm right.

1:31:19.062 --> 1:31:20.647
I'll show everybody.

1:31:20.689 --> 1:31:23.817
The age of parents is over.

1:31:23.858 --> 1:31:26.277
(babies cooing, murmuring)

1:31:28.697 --> 1:31:31.157
ARMSTRONG:
Yay, yay, yay. (sighs)

1:31:31.199 --> 1:31:33.827
How about you watch me
have a little toast?

1:31:33.868 --> 1:31:37.122
To the baby revolution
and to me.

1:31:37.163 --> 1:31:38.581
(gasps)

1:31:40.709 --> 1:31:42.627
-It's time for the
candy volcano... -Mmm, mmm.

1:31:42.669 --> 1:31:44.504
-Oh, that's good.
-TABITHA and TINA: Of doom!

1:31:44.546 --> 1:31:46.506
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1:31:46.548 --> 1:31:48.008
No, no, no! No!

1:31:48.049 --> 1:31:50.510
(yells)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:31:50.552 --> 1:31:52.178
-No, no, no.
-Boom shakalaka?

1:31:52.220 --> 1:31:53.847
-Boom!
-Don't do that!

1:31:53.888 --> 1:31:56.141
-(crackling, sizzling)
-(screaming)

1:31:56.182 --> 1:31:58.435

1:31:58.476 --> 1:32:00.729
-Whoa!
-(screaming)

1:32:00.770 --> 1:32:02.355
-(grunts)
-TINA: Oh, no!

1:32:02.397 --> 1:32:03.857
-Tabitha!
-(Armstrong grunting)

1:32:03.898 --> 1:32:04.858

1:32:04.899 --> 1:32:06.735
No! Someone help me, please!

1:32:06.776 --> 1:32:08.695
Tabitha, hang on!

1:32:08.737 --> 1:32:11.031
Ted, I need upsies-- now.

1:32:11.072 --> 1:32:12.782

1:32:12.824 --> 1:32:15.785

-(Tabitha screaming)

1:32:17.537 --> 1:32:19.205
Dad, help me!

1:32:19.247 --> 1:32:20.331
Look at you.

1:32:20.373 --> 1:32:22.208
You're smart. You're strong.

1:32:22.250 --> 1:32:23.543
You don't need parents.

1:32:23.585 --> 1:32:25.587
What can they possibly
offer you?

1:32:25.628 --> 1:32:28.048
-How about unconditional love?
-(gasps, yells)

1:32:28.089 --> 1:32:29.799
-That's what.
-No, no, no. No.

1:32:29.841 --> 1:32:32.010
-Sayonara.
-No, no, no. No. (screams)

1:32:33.595 --> 1:32:36.222
-(grunts)
-(Armstrong screams, whimpers)

1:32:36.264 --> 1:32:37.599
TIM:

1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:39.392
(strained grunting)

1:32:39.434 --> 1:32:41.353
(yells)

1:32:41.394 --> 1:32:43.021
-I'm gonna fall!
-Tabitha!

1:32:43.063 --> 1:32:44.230
Hang on!

1:32:44.272 --> 1:32:45.607
(screams)

1:32:45.648 --> 1:32:47.942
I got you. I got you.

1:32:47.984 --> 1:32:49.778
(both sigh)

1:32:49.819 --> 1:32:52.030
I got you, Tabitha.

1:32:52.072 --> 1:32:54.657
(panting)

1:32:54.699 --> 1:32:56.618
I got you.

1:32:56.659 --> 1:32:59.162
That's my big brother.

1:32:59.954 --> 1:33:02.957
Thanks, Marcos Lightspeed.

1:33:05.001 --> 1:33:06.628
Mwah.

1:33:07.462 --> 1:33:09.464
I thought we both
had to grow up.

1:33:09.506 --> 1:33:11.925
Well, let's not
grow up too fast.

1:33:11.966 --> 1:33:13.426
(sighs)

1:33:13.468 --> 1:33:14.844
I love you, Dad.

1:33:14.886 --> 1:33:16.763
I love you, Tabitha Templeton.

1:33:16.805 --> 1:33:18.973
Aw. You see that?

1:33:19.015 --> 1:33:21.267
And you wanted
to take it all away.

1:33:21.309 --> 1:33:22.769
-Where you going?
-Home.

1:33:22.811 --> 1:33:25.647
You know, Doc,
childhood doesn't last forever,

1:33:25.689 --> 1:33:27.524
but family sure does.

1:33:27.565 --> 1:33:29.275
Uncle Ted! Heads up!

1:33:29.317 --> 1:33:31.069
-(screams, grunts)
-Woo-hoo!

(kids cheering)

1:34:14.279 --> 1:34:17.699
Mommy, Daddy,
I missed you so much.

1:34:17.741 --> 1:34:20.118
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yay!

1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:21.327

1:34:21.369 --> 1:34:23.121
-Glue!
-(Jimbo yelps)

1:34:23.163 --> 1:34:25.248
So soft.

1:34:25.290 --> 1:34:26.708
Where are we going?

1:34:26.750 --> 1:34:28.001
Not bad, Templetons.

1:34:28.043 --> 1:34:29.753
Woo-hoo! Yay, Templetons.

1:34:29.794 --> 1:34:31.254
Yeah, mission accomplished.

1:34:31.296 --> 1:34:34.424
And as a bonus,
we stopped Armstrong, too.

1:34:34.466 --> 1:34:35.967
-Huh?
-What?

1:34:36.009 --> 1:34:38.845
My real mission was
getting you two back together.

1:34:38.887 --> 1:34:41.681
-A-plus! See me after class.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1:34:41.723 --> 1:34:43.433
Wait, so you never
actually quit?

1:34:43.475 --> 1:34:44.684
-Nope.
-Huh.

1:34:44.726 --> 1:34:45.852
Well played.

1:34:45.894 --> 1:34:47.187
I don't like to mix the two,

1:34:47.228 --> 1:34:48.730
but I will say
it was never business.

1:34:48.772 --> 1:34:50.273
It was always personal.

1:34:50.315 --> 1:34:51.649
You know what, kid?

1:34:51.691 --> 1:34:53.943
You're the best boss
I ever had.

1:34:53.985 --> 1:34:55.570
-Thank you, chief.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1:34:55.612 --> 1:34:57.197

Tim! You actually made it.

-Yeah.
-I mean, I knew you'd make it.

-Teddy.
-Teddy, you're here.

1:35:01.117 --> 1:35:03.244
-And look what you're wearing.
-Uh...

1:35:03.286 --> 1:35:05.205
Sweetheart, I cried.

1:35:05.246 --> 1:35:06.373
Then I went blank.

1:35:06.414 --> 1:35:08.166
Oh, come on.
Every-Everyone get together.

1:35:08.208 --> 1:35:10.043
This... We got to get this.
Here we go.

1:35:10.085 --> 1:35:11.711

Thank you. Thank you.

Aw, hey, Precious.

1:35:44.452 --> 1:35:45.787

1:35:45.829 --> 1:35:47.664
Oh, I wish Teddy
could have been here.

I'm younger than you.

-(laughing)
-TED: No, you didn't.

1:36:45.513 --> 1:36:46.806
Aah! You missed me!

1:36:46.848 --> 1:36:48.475
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1:36:48.516 --> 1:36:49.893
-Ambush.
-Exactly.

1:36:49.934 --> 1:36:51.353
-TIM: Ow!
-TED: Sneak attack!

1:36:51.394 --> 1:36:53.480
Oh, isn't it great
to see them fighting again?

1:36:53.521 --> 1:36:54.814

1:36:54.856 --> 1:36:56.483
(toy phone ringing)

1:36:57.817 --> 1:36:59.527
Shouldn't you pick up?

1:36:59.569 --> 1:37:01.488
Nah, we got some
family business.

1:37:01.529 --> 1:37:03.031
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1:37:07.786 --> 1:37:10.372
CHILD (on phone): Tina, we have
another assignment for you.

1:37:10.413 --> 1:37:12.123

I'm listening.

Grandma's coming in hot!

1:37:14.209 --> 1:37:16.753

-Gotcha!

<i>You can't stop time.</i>

1:37:20.256 --> 1:37:22.592

-TABITHA: I'm gonna get you!
-(Precious neighs)

1:37:24.427 --> 1:37:26.054
TIM: <i>So, even though</i>
<i>you're only a kid once...</i>

1:37:26.096 --> 1:37:27.889
<i>well, unless you get</i>
<i>to be a kid twice,</i>

1:37:27.931 --> 1:37:30.141
<i>which is really weird,</i>
<i>to be honest,</i>

1:37:30.183 --> 1:37:33.144
<i>but the point is</i>
<i>you have to grow up sometime.</i>

1:37:33.186 --> 1:37:35.397
-(Wizzie laughing)
-(camera clicks)

1:37:35.438 --> 1:37:38.149

TINA: <i>Ah,</i>
<i>that was really sweet, Daddy.</i>

1:37:40.276 --> 1:37:42.112
<i>That'll be great for my report.</i>

1:37:42.153 --> 1:37:44.322

<i>Okay, so... so that's it, then.</i>

1:37:44.364 --> 1:37:47.075
TINA: <i>Well, actually,</i>
<i>there's one more little thing.</i>

Wha...

1:38:06.011 --> 1:38:09.097
-(gasps) Oh, my son.
