WEBVTT

00:30.130 --> 00:31.837
It's all right.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.741
Alan?
It's all right. Relax.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.047
What happened?
You tell me.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.155
I found you here passed out.

00:46.346 --> 00:49.520
What do you remember'?
Uh, I was, uh...

00:50.250 --> 00:52.423
I was, uh...

00:53.186 --> 00:57.828
taking a shower, decontamination
procedures and, uh...

01:00.894 --> 01:03.773
Uh... Um...

01:05.065 --> 01:06.669
I, uh...

01:07.734 --> 01:09.372
What?
I...

01:10.103 --> 01:12.606
Jules.
I felt lightheaded. I don't remember...

01:12.839 --> 01:15.046
I don't remember
what happened next.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.279
I guess I, um...

01:18.512 --> 01:21.356
I didn't realize how exhausted I am.

01:22.215 --> 01:26.186
Well, we've all been pushing
really hard.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.692
You need to get a few hours' sleep.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.368
I need you a hundred percent.

01:30.557 --> 01:31.627
Okay, good idea.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.566
I'll walk you back to your quarters.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.470
With Peter roaming around out there,
it's not safe to go alone.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.974
I'll give you a moment.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.514
Hello?

02:21.008 --> 02:22.646
Anybody in here?

03:02.449 --> 03:04.224
Help.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.662
Help me.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.449
Please report to me immediately
if you see any skin lesions,

04:08.515 --> 04:11.121
flu-like symptoms
or black mucus discharge.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.359
Should we not be taking antivirals?

04:14.554 --> 04:18.297
Like oseltamivir?
That's for H1N1 influenza.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.766
We've ruled that out
as a cause of infection.

04:20.961 --> 04:24.238
What is it then?
It's all right.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.076
Taking the wrong meds
can do more harm than no meds at all.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.080
We're working round the clock
on a treatment, and when we find it,

04:32.272 --> 04:34.115
we'll attack the virus aggressively.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.494
Now they are scared, I get that,

04:44.718 --> 04:46.891
but sometimes,
I just wanna yell at them.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.226
We're not the enemy here.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.940
Security teams
are doing constant sweeps.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.636
Still no sign of our three escapees
or Peter Farragut.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.340
And another attack has been reported
on Level G, two more possibly infected.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.575
They're being moved to isolation.

05:20.287 --> 05:24.258
We've been in lockdown for 32 hours.
People are panicking.

05:24.424 --> 05:27.633
If something doesn't change,
we risk losing control of the base.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.331
Where is Julia Walker?

05:32.599 --> 05:35.512
I'm not sure.
Do you wanna speak to her?

05:36.269 --> 05:38.010
That won't be necessary.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.387
Dr. Farragut, what are you doing?

05:48.548 --> 05:51.529
Getting my brother into containment.
Why didn't you inform us?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.791
Because I presumed the man
you had following me would tip you off.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.398
I want a full workup, LFT, CBC
with differential, coags, viral screen,

05:59.626 --> 06:01.867
and all available antigen-antibody
assays.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.669
My security teams couldn't wrangle him.
How did you manage it?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.868
He turned himself in.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.984
What is Peter's status?
Stable for now.

06:21.181 --> 06:26.255
I meant the status of his sedation.
We don't want another security incident.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.489
That's unlikely.

06:27.821 --> 06:33.066
As unlikely as cutting off a man's hand
to access his RFID chip?

06:33.260 --> 06:36.571
Peter gave himself up,
no fight, no struggle.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.743
Why would he
if he were planning to escape?

06:38.899 --> 06:41.743
That's what we thought the last time
we put him in isolation.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.745
He appears to be controllable
on morphine.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.714
I've hooked him up to a pain pump.
He shouldn't be a danger.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.446
I'm not willing to take that chance.
Neither am I.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.921
Is there somewhere more secure
we can hold him?

06:57.450 --> 07:00.863
This floor was phase one
of Arctic Biosystems.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.125
As the company grew,
so did the facility.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.235
Level R contains our early labs
and living quarters,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.963
along with maintenance
for the entire base.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.139
The CO2 oxygen scrubbers,

07:11.364 --> 07:13.435
the heating systems,
equipment storage,

07:14.034 --> 07:16.708
though most of the lab work
has moved upstairs.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.952
Scheduled maintenance.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.059
Now we use this level for sensitive
and hazardous research.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.719
One of the empty labs should provide
the security you're looking for.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.829
The ventilation system in this room
is separate from the rest of the facility.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.936
The walls are concrete,
three feet thick,

07:40.460 --> 07:44.135
and the door is double-plated steel.
Nothing is getting in or out.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.676
What kind of research were you
conducting with nuclear reactors?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.411
I spent time at Sandia Labs.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.414
The burn patterns on these walls
are virtually identical.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.520
Controlled fusion,
a project we abandoned.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.749
When was the last
radiation screen down here?

08:00.914 --> 08:04.760
We test every six months, and the
lab has been empty for about five years.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.196
So it's safe?
Perfectly.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.765
More than qualified
to be an isolation unit for Peter.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.664
And for everyone else as well.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.997
There are empty rooms
on this level, plenty of space,

08:16.763 --> 08:19.175
and this secure lab allows us

08:19.366 --> 08:22.210
to separate vectors from
those who are just infected.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.439
Vectors?

08:23.603 --> 08:27.107
It's what we're calling the infected
who are physically attacking others

08:27.307 --> 08:30.151
to spread the disease, like Peter.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.386
I think we can achieve
full containment down here.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.490
What are you saying?

08:36.282 --> 08:39.456
I'm saying we turn Level R
into an isolation floor.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.536
Get it together, Jules.

10:05.371 --> 10:09.547
You don't get sick.

10:13.813 --> 10:17.317
<i>Attention, code 425, Level R.</i>

10:19.486 --> 10:22.558
All right, we have 18 sick in isolation,
including Peter.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.566
With three on the loose
and two presumed infected, that's 23.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.137
That we know of.
I wanna move them down to Level R.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.673
I'll need medical equipment.
Turn one of the labs into a triage unit.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.242
I'll need food, water,
bedding for 40 patients.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.607
This will get bigger
before we achieve full containment.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.680
I think we can accommodate that.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.183
Help me. Help me.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.811
- Help me.
- Stay where you are.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.483
I'm sorry I ran. They made me do it.
We can help.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.094
They made me.
You need to stop.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.821
Believe me. They made me-

11:08.635 --> 11:10.512
Bring a gurney,
and find Dr. Chaplin.

11:10.703 --> 11:11.773
No. There's no time.

11:11.938 --> 11:12.939
She's going into shock.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.679
Find me a scalpel
and something to pack into the wound.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.127
Stay with me now.
You'll be okay. Hurry up!

11:35.795 --> 11:37.468
Right, I feel the bullet.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.474
Here, pinch off this vein.
Pinch off this vein.

11:41.901 --> 11:45.371
Yes. More pressure. Right there.
I have it, I have it.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.219
All right.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.357
You're gonna be fine now.
She should be stable enough

11:56.516 --> 11:57.517
to move.

11:57.684 --> 12:01.393
We take her down to the fusion lab.
Thanks to your quick thinking.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.865
My quick thinking shouldn't have been
necessary in the first place.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.936
All right. Come on.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.233
Come on!

12:10.897 --> 12:13.503
She was unarmed
and asking for our help.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.737
I was only trying
to protect Dr. Hatake.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.915
She wasn't threatening him,
she was scared.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.846
The situation was escalating.
It didn't escalate until you panicked,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.020
and almost murdered
an infected patient.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.450
I set the rules on this base.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.056
There are no countries here,
no laws.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.855
Dr. Sulemani's life
is my responsibility, not Daniel's.

12:32.051 --> 12:36.363
As senior scientist on this case,
every patients life is my responsibility.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.126
You tell your security people

12:38.291 --> 12:42.535
that this is the last time lethal force
is to be used on one of my patients.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.709
I can't guarantee that.
You tell them.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.104
Or I will pull my team

12:47.300 --> 12:51.112
and we can do this again
in six months' time as a postmortem.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.133
What did you do to me, Peter?

13:15.762 --> 13:17.605
What did you do?

14:16.723 --> 14:20.034
We seal off the stairwells,
use the elevator for an airlock,

14:20.226 --> 14:22.297
and once we control access
to the floor,

14:22.495 --> 14:24.406
we should have
a viable isolation unit.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.702
Healthy people come upstairs, sick
people go down. It might work.

14:27.900 --> 14:31.313
But if people aren't showing symptoms
yet, how do we know who's infected?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.247
We'll need a test, something
that we can administer quickly.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.011
A rapid-response test
would be the fastest.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.520
But first we need to synthesize
a pure sample of the virus.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.922
Both viruses. What about
those vials you found in Peter's lab?

14:44.083 --> 14:47.929
Neither Narvik-A nor B show up as a
pathogen in any existing database.

14:48.087 --> 14:52.058
Narvik-B is the strain that created
the vectors in the rat population, right?

14:52.258 --> 14:54.670
How long to synthesize a test
based on that variant?

14:54.861 --> 14:57.364
Eight hours at least
for something functional.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.099
You have four. Work with Jordan.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.243
Tell me more about
this infected monkey.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.607
I think the virus
inside the monkey is the key.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.440
I'm sequencing the full genome now.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.083
If we can prove the infection
passed from monkey to human...

15:08.274 --> 15:10.413
It gets us closer to the original strain.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.921
And the best shot we have at a vaccine.
All right, get started on it.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.457
I'll go with her.
Can't be too careful right now.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.754
Thanks, but I can take care of myself.
Doreen, take him with you.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.897
All right, everybody,
the com-link window

15:23.055 --> 15:25.729
goes live
in six hours and 42 minutes.

15:25.925 --> 15:30.032
If we have this data to upload to Atlanta,
we might just get on top of this thing.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.264
Let's get to work.

15:54.554 --> 15:58.969
... and 20 bags... Make
that 30 bags of saline drip.

15:59.158 --> 16:04.005
Our base doctor's seen Dr.
Sulemani. She's gonna make it.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.606
Well, have him keep her
on a propofol infusion.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.404
I didn't panic with Sulemani.

16:10.570 --> 16:14.518
She was infected with a lethal virus
and coming at Dr. Hatake.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.847
I assessed the options
and I pulled the trigger.

16:17.009 --> 16:20.354
We shoot everyone who's infected?
Is that it? Eliminate the threat?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.288
If necessary.
And those who might be infected?

16:23.449 --> 16:24.484
We kill them too?

16:28.855 --> 16:33.201
The only reason you didn't fire that shot
is because the gun wasn't in your hands.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.775
<i>Maintenance
team to living quarters, Level B.</i>

16:48.274 --> 16:50.220
Another false positive.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.946
Me too. I've gone through
all the atypical enzymes.

16:53.145 --> 16:56.649
You started with atypicals?
Their catalyzation rate is too low.

16:56.816 --> 17:00.229
I read a study that linked the use of
atypical enzymes to viral antibodies.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.866
Start wide and narrow it down.
It's why I assigned you EC-1 enzymes.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.400
EC-1 catalyzes with everything.
It tells us nothing.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.628
We don't have time to go through
a thousand different enzymes.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.364
If we're gonna come up with a test,
we need to do some...

17:10.530 --> 17:11.565
Sarah.
What?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.142
What's wrong with your hand?

17:15.568 --> 17:16.637
Are you okay?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.178
You feeling any symptoms?

17:21.339 --> 17:24.877
I've been up for three days straight.
I'm probably just exhausted.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.360
We're out of Peter's blood serum.
I'll get some more.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.654
I'll do it.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.200
If you find the virus
did come from the monkeys,

17:46.399 --> 17:49.937
will that help you figure out a cure?
Curing a virus is a relative term.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.514
We need a treatment
to help the infected get better,

17:52.672 --> 17:55.175
and a vaccine to prevent anyone else
from getting infected.

17:55.341 --> 17:59.221
That sick monkey is just
the first step down a long road.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.554
Where the hell is my monkey?

18:08.187 --> 18:12.067
What's that smell?
Formaldehyde.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.262
Whoever did this wanted to kill
any living organism left behind.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.771
They didn't want me analyzing
the samples.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.965
It reeks.

18:19.131 --> 18:21.873
Reeks all right. Reeks of Hatake.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.382
What are you gonna do? Walk into
his office and demand answers?

18:26.572 --> 18:29.143
Why not?
Because you know how that's gonna go.

18:29.375 --> 18:33.721
He's gonna say it was biosafety
protocol, or scheduled maintenance.

18:33.913 --> 18:38.123
I knew this full-bird colonel,
just like Hatake. Real stickler.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.458
You had to find creative ways
to get things done.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.595
What'd you have in mind?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.471
What if I could get you
another monkey sample?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.521
What are you doing here?

19:11.751 --> 19:14.925
Three days ago, we were moving on
with our lives and now this?

19:16.789 --> 19:19.770
Seeing you,
it all comes flooding back,

19:20.426 --> 19:25.375
how unhappy I was with Alan,
how I couldn't even recognize

19:26.599 --> 19:29.170
who I was with him anymore.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.305
But instead of acknowledging it,
I didn't say anything.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.481
I just swallowed it, all of it,
until it filled me up,

19:36.642 --> 19:38.679
and I was drowning in it.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.323
And then you.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.961
I thought I could handle this.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.412
Never seen anything like this.
Look at their faces.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.806
I know. It's pretty damn scary.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.987
No, not scary, scared.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.745
These monkeys were running
for their lives.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.082
Running from what?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.690
How'd you find this place, anyway?

20:19.885 --> 20:23.230
I was just checking the stability
of the icepack around the base.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.504
Horseshit. Who the hell are you?

20:27.693 --> 20:29.866
I'm just an Army engineer, like I said.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.043
You wanna work together?
I got no problem with that.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.405
But you have got to start
telling me the truth.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.171
I am.
Huh.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.678
There are people in the Army,
myself included,

20:42.875 --> 20:46.220
who are wondering
if this outbreak was an accident.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.860
You think Hatake did this on purpose?
Why would he do that?

20:52.718 --> 20:54.425
Why don't you come
help me find out?

21:15.875 --> 21:19.948
I want 24-hour guards on this door
until we get full containment.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.284
Base one, go ahead.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.726
They found one of
the escapees on this level.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.642
What are you so happy about?
Nothing. I just cracked the test.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.675
You figured it out?
Which enzyme catalyzed?

21:48.908 --> 21:51.821
None of them. After you left,
I remembered another study.

21:52.011 --> 21:55.083
It utilizes the body's natural way
of detecting foreign pathogens.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.454
White blood cells, yes.
Get to the point.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.654
It modified the blood cells
with genes from a crystal jellyfish

22:00.820 --> 22:03.596
<i>Aequorea Victoria,</i>
to create a rapid-response test.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.831
The jellyfish genes produce
a fluorescent green protein.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.165
You replicated this?
I swabbed three security techs

22:09.328 --> 22:12.366
for control samples, all clear.
I ran the test on known infectees

22:12.531 --> 22:16.445
Peter, Dr. Tracey and Dr. DeKlerk.
All green, positive for infection.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.881
Show me again.
Use yourself as a control.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.679
Why does that matter?

22:26.111 --> 22:29.217
If you wanna see it in action,
I can take a swab from you right now.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.863
Okay. Test me.

22:38.490 --> 22:42.404
I don't know why we're wasting our
time with this. We need to tell Alan.

23:18.063 --> 23:21.044
Come on, Duchamp!
I know you're in there!

23:21.533 --> 23:23.843
Don't come any closer.
Put it down. Put it down.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.744
We're going to help you.
Just like you took care of Dr. Sulemani.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.859
What happened to Dr. Sulemani
You want us to die!

23:28.941 --> 23:30.181
Was a terrible mistake.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.789
We don't wanna hurt you,
but you have to come to isolation.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.551
I'm not going there.
I'm not even infected.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.356
Or at least I wasn't until you
threw me in with the rest of them.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.092
Let me help you.
I want the cure!

23:46.292 --> 23:48.135
We don't have a cure.
Bullshit.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.532
The SODRA's in there.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.732
You're keeping it from us,
and I'm not gonna let you.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.449
Put him in the fusion lab
with Sulemani.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.152
This is Alan Farragut of the CDC.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.451
Everybody all right in there?

24:10.883 --> 24:12.385
Thank God. They almost got in.

24:12.584 --> 24:15.565
What's your name?
Philippe Duchamp.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.826
What was he saying
about you having a cure?

24:19.058 --> 24:22.562
This is ridiculous.
There is no cure.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.262
Adding growth factor

24:54.426 --> 24:56.770
so the cells will build
a critical mass

24:56.962 --> 24:59.340
for the genome sequencing.

24:59.965 --> 25:03.105
And we stick it in the incubator
and wait.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.112
So do the same thing
I've been doing for the last hour.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.379
Is that supposed to happen?

25:29.995 --> 25:31.838
When you said you
were growing the virus...?

25:31.997 --> 25:33.340
It wasn't supposed to grow like that.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.671
Like it was alive?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.710
Viruses aren't living organisms.

25:36.902 --> 25:39.746
They lack any form of energy
or carbon metabolism.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.646
Why did it Hulk out?
That's what we're gonna find out.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.913
Maybe Alan will know why
it reacted violently to the growth factor.

25:46.078 --> 25:50.254
Wait. Don't.
Don't what?

25:50.749 --> 25:53.753
Don't tell anyone.
If Hatake gets wind of this,

25:53.919 --> 25:55.899
it'll be the monkey room
all over again.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.702
I still don't trust you,

26:02.027 --> 26:04.234
but when you're right, you're right.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.613
Dr. Bryce said Duchamp
was working on a cure,

26:14.840 --> 26:17.719
something called SODRA.
I can't discuss that.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.949
The research is proprietary.
No. No more secrets.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.060
You promised me transparency.

26:25.684 --> 26:30.360
When the satellite comes online,
I'll speak with my board of directors.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.196
You will tell me
everything I need to know,

26:33.392 --> 26:35.372
or when that satellite comes online,

26:35.561 --> 26:38.064
I'll tell every major
news organization on Earth

26:38.263 --> 26:41.972
what's happening in this base. You
think you're afraid of the U.S. military?

26:42.201 --> 26:45.580
Wait till you have to keep
your secrets from the New <i>York Post.</i>

26:47.873 --> 26:50.649
SODRA is an antiviral treatment

26:50.809 --> 26:54.052
with an astonishing cure rate,

26:54.213 --> 26:55.954
nearly 100 percent.

26:58.317 --> 27:02.561
When you say cure,
you mean total viral elimination?

27:02.955 --> 27:06.425
With no harm to host cells?
Yes.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.338
How many viruses
have you tested against?

27:10.496 --> 27:13.636
How wide a range?
All of them.

27:13.832 --> 27:16.779
H1N1? Hepatitis? HIV?

27:16.969 --> 27:20.143
Hell, smallpox is a virus.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.484
There are only two places
on Earth

27:23.675 --> 27:27.782
that house smallpox, the CDC
and Vector Institute in Russia.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.824
Actually, there are three.

27:33.919 --> 27:39.164
You have been growing lethal viruses for
the purpose of developing a cure-all.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.497
SODRA works.

27:41.693 --> 27:46.005
In all animal lest cases,
the viruses were killed.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.275
The only problem
is the mortality rate.

27:53.105 --> 27:57.611
How many subjects were killed?
Over 75 percent.

27:59.178 --> 28:03.217
Which is why SODRA
is not an option.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.056
Level R has been sealed.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.202
We'll take everyone downstairs,
go person to person.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.896
Anyone who's infected stays below,
everyone else comes back up.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.871
A hundred and forty tests
ready to go.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.741
You two did good work.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.404
if I call your name,

28:49.027 --> 28:52.338
please step over here,
take a face shield from Dr. Jordan,

28:52.531 --> 28:54.909
and then come stand over here.

28:55.701 --> 28:58.841
Doctors Alvarez,

29:00.038 --> 29:01.949
Mihalovich,

29:04.009 --> 29:08.082
Hassan, Security Tech Terry,

29:08.547 --> 29:10.356
Dr. Sun-Lee,

29:11.950 --> 29:14.453
and Security Tech Gruning.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.602
Those of you whose names
I have called, you'll follow me.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.737
The rest of you will stay
with Dr. Jordan and Dr. Walker.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.372
Wait.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.931
Why are they getting to go
back upstairs?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.606
Because they tested negative
for the virus.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.119
Please find any empty cot,
make yourselves at home.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.918
Dr. Walker and Dr. Jordan
will be coming around

29:42.114 --> 29:43.991
to collect your medical information.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.318
Go ahead.

29:48.887 --> 29:50.662
- That's the last group.
- How many?

29:51.056 --> 29:53.736
Forty-three infected.
That's almost a third of the base.

29:54.459 --> 29:58.464
I wanna bring Doctors Bryce
and Sulemani down here.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.100
Shouldn't they stay locked up
in the lab? They tried to escape once.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.448
This floor is secure.
There's no way out.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.181
Excuse me.

30:16.782 --> 30:20.025
Isolating this level was a good idea.

30:20.252 --> 30:23.324
People are settling in.
Yeah, but they're scared.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.775
I think a lot of them believed
they weren't sick.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.704
Part of them knew.
They just didn't wanna believe it.

30:37.636 --> 30:40.048
I took Peter's vitals again.
He's all over the place.

30:41.873 --> 30:45.548
I'm sending his lab work to the CDC
<i>as</i> soon as the satellite window opens.

30:45.777 --> 30:49.884
Get some more heads in the game, on
finding a safe treatment and a vaccine.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.728
That may be too late for him.

30:59.491 --> 31:03.667
Open the door. Let's get these
people into the isolation barracks.

31:59.451 --> 32:03.627
Almost done with the samples?
I was just about to bring them upstairs.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.599
What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm fine. I just slipped.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.700
What? Are you infected, Sarah?

32:16.301 --> 32:18.501
You were in the stockroom
with Peter. Did he attack you?

32:18.637 --> 32:22.414
No. I told you. He ran off.
That's right, you told us.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.051
You think I would lie about that?

32:27.245 --> 32:30.124
Your symptoms. You tried to hide
your hand tremor this morning.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.455
You wouldn't use yourself
as a control sample

32:32.651 --> 32:35.962
for the rapid-response test.
You want me to take the test?

32:36.121 --> 32:39.568
Fine.
I'm not judging. I can understand why...

32:39.758 --> 32:42.398
I would never risk spreading
an infectious disease.

32:42.594 --> 32:46.303
That's completely unethical.
What kind of doctor do you think I am?

33:01.847 --> 33:03.349
It's clear.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.829
Happy?
I'm sorry. I just... I thought that...

33:08.019 --> 33:11.466
Where's Alan?
Checking the triage room. Why?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.158
We have a problem.

33:13.358 --> 33:15.201
Dr. Sulemani broke out
of the fusion lab.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.930
She killed Dr. Bryce.
What?

33:18.129 --> 33:22.509
Dr. Sulemani is on this level?
She's killing people!

33:22.667 --> 33:24.340
- Get me out of here!
- Killing people?

33:25.804 --> 33:27.044
Out of the way!

33:28.139 --> 33:29.948
Remain calm.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.149
Stop!

33:33.545 --> 33:35.491
- Let me out of here!
- Just stay calm.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.058
Calm down.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.831
Everyone remain calm.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.226
Sarah!
Alan!

33:43.455 --> 33:45.298
What's going on? Where's Julia?

33:46.958 --> 33:48.403
Get back!

33:51.897 --> 33:53.672
Julia!

34:02.140 --> 34:03.710
- Come on!
- Out of the way!

34:03.875 --> 34:05.582
Out of the hallway!
Get out of the hallway!

34:05.744 --> 34:07.746
Get out of the way!
Get out of the hallway!

35:54.986 --> 35:56.795
We need to get in the elevator.
I can't.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.663
We'll regroup, get medical supplies.
I have to stay here.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.327
It's too dangerous. We have to go.
Alan, I can't.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.623
What happened?

36:22.547 --> 36:23.821
Where is Dr. Walker?

36:25.784 --> 36:26.956
She's staying down there.

36:28.653 --> 36:32.624
How could you risk leaving her?
Dr. Farragut. Alan!

36:37.162 --> 36:39.472
She's infected. She has the virus.

36:41.966 --> 36:46.073
We need to seal off Level R.
It's the only way to stop the contagion.

36:46.304 --> 36:49.842
Leave them down there?
With no food or water?

36:50.041 --> 36:53.181
There's a week's worth of supplies.
He's right.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.857
We've...

36:56.314 --> 36:59.887
I have lost control of this situation.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.231
We need to seal it off.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.891
How can you say that
with Dr. Walker still down there?

37:06.091 --> 37:07.764
It's only until help arrives.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.932
When the satellite com link
goes operative again,

37:13.098 --> 37:15.578
I'm calling in the Army for backup.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.184
Two hundred
and seventy-four.

38:34.746 --> 38:38.284
Three nurses in Kikwit of Ebola,

38:38.817 --> 38:42.424
family of six in Sudan, Lassa fever,

38:43.288 --> 38:47.828
10 students in a Heidelberg dorm,
Legionnaires' Disease...

38:47.992 --> 38:50.973
We've all had people
die on our watch, Alan.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.371
It's part of the job.
We save who we can.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.813
I could live with 274 because
it was the disease that killed them,

39:00.004 --> 39:02.780
not me, until now.

39:05.043 --> 39:09.958
I not only killed someone
with my own hands today,

39:10.882 --> 39:13.624
but it's very likely...

39:13.785 --> 39:15.025
Julia is very likely...

39:15.186 --> 39:17.996
Way I hear it,
you didn't have much of a choice.

39:19.691 --> 39:24.003
What we're dealing with here,
none of us has ever seen.

39:25.630 --> 39:29.737
You're still the best CDC has.
I've seen you pull off miracles.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.914
You'll figure out a way
to save them both.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.489
What happened with the monkey?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.758
Uh, it's inconclusive for now.

39:47.685 --> 39:52.065
That's too bad.
I'm still doing tests.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.661
No. No.

41:05.129 --> 41:09.339
No, they should be green,
they should all be green. It doesn't work.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.475
It doesn't work.

41:27.618 --> 41:30.155
Observation.
Doreen, where's Alan?

41:34.926 --> 41:36.303
Jules?

41:40.131 --> 41:41.508
Hello?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.007
Alan?

41:45.203 --> 41:47.683
Jules? You there? Jules?

41:50.775 --> 41:52.846
Hello?

41:54.045 --> 41:55.524
Can anybody hear me?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.989
The test doesn't work!

42:01.185 --> 42:03.222
It doesn't work!

42:12.830 --> 42:14.992
