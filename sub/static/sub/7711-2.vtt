WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.571
Pam?
Yeah?

00:03.604 --> 00:05.273
Did you see Oprah
yesterday?

00:05.306 --> 00:06.707
No, I didn't.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.710
I, uh...

00:09.743 --> 00:11.712
I am going to be a father.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.615
What was Oprah about?

00:14.648 --> 00:17.085
Angelina Jolie was on.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.786
And she adopted a baby
from Asia

00:18.819 --> 00:20.821
and she said that
it changed her life.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.391
And that really inspired me.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.693
So I want you to look in
to see how much

00:25.726 --> 00:29.197
a little Chinese baby
would cost.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.799
That's a really
big decision.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.268
I know.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.769
Maybe you should wait
before you adopt.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.538
Or not adopt.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.707
Just do it, okay?

00:39.740 --> 00:41.609
Roy's sister
looked into it.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.777
And the application alone
costs $1,000.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.581
Um...

00:47.615 --> 00:50.618
Find out if
there's a cheaper...

00:50.651 --> 00:53.121
Less expensive baby
out there, okay?

00:53.154 --> 00:55.156
You know--she also said
the waiting list

00:55.189 --> 00:56.257
is like eight months.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.691
Eight months?
Yeah.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.327
I don't even know if I want
a baby in eight months.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.594
Probably won't.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.663
[exhales]

01:04.632 --> 01:07.601
You know, Pam,
if in ten years...

01:07.635 --> 01:09.203
I haven't had a baby,

01:09.237 --> 01:10.604
and you haven't
had a baby...

01:10.638 --> 01:11.705
No, Michael.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.642
20 years.
No, Michael.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.177
30.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.480
Sure.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.783
It's a deal.

01:54.748 --> 01:55.816
All right,
three pairs of pants.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.817
Mm-hmm.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.486
Three pairs of socks.
Mm-hmm.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.354
Three packs of condoms.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.456
Yeeeash.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.724
Uh, fun jeans.

02:06.927 --> 02:07.928
Ah.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.464
Sign.
Per diem.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.633
Guess where I am going?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.468
I will give you a hint.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.703
It is a booze-fueled
sex romp

02:15.736 --> 02:16.737
where anything goes.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.639
You are correct sir!

02:18.672 --> 02:20.841
I am headed to Philadelphia
for the annual

02:20.874 --> 02:24.178
Northeastern Mid-market
Office Supply Convention.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.280
And Jim Halpert
is going to be coming,

02:26.314 --> 02:27.781
which will be fun.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.551
Poor little guy
has been stuck

02:30.584 --> 02:32.753
working under Josh.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.788
The poor man's
Michael Scott,

02:34.822 --> 02:36.790
as he is known
around my condo.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.728
Don't be mad.
It is a business trip.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.731
But I don't understand.
It's for managers.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.533
Monkey, I am an ARM.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.634
Assistant Regional Manager.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.402
I know.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.205
I was just really hoping
we could

02:51.239 --> 02:52.640
spend some time together.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.546
Are you still there?
Yes, Monkey.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.381
Don't monkey me.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.817
You can't wait
to get out of here, ARM.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.720
In the Martin family,
we like to say...

03:06.754 --> 03:08.222
looks like someone
took the slow train

03:08.256 --> 03:09.757
from Philly.

03:09.790 --> 03:13.827
That's code for
"Check out the slut."

03:13.861 --> 03:16.564
What is...

03:16.597 --> 03:17.698
Why are there flies
in here?

03:17.731 --> 03:18.899
Oh, my God!

03:18.932 --> 03:20.701
Are you so excited
for tonight?

03:20.734 --> 03:21.735
I'm so excited--you guys
are gonna click.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.936
I can feel it.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.472
So what are you wearing?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.873
This.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.512
You look so pretty.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.948
Thank you.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.617
Yes, I have a date.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.620
He's a cartoonist
for the local paper.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.754
Which is really neat,

03:40.788 --> 03:44.492
because I like
to draw too.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.727
I'm kind of nervous.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.296
I haven't been
on a first date

03:48.329 --> 03:51.932
in nine years.

03:51.965 --> 03:55.603
Probably shouldn't
broadcast that.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.338
Well, remember, no matter
how much you may want to,

03:57.371 --> 03:58.572
do not sleep with him
on the first date.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.741
It gives him all the power.

04:00.774 --> 04:01.742
Sleep with who?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.811
Whom.
Whom?

04:03.844 --> 04:04.812
My neighbor Allen.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.846
They're going on
a date tonight.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.014
Oh, wow.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.982
Oh, my God.
I have a great idea.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.618
You know what you should do?
Be hilarious?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.586
Wear your wedding dress.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.756
That would be
a great icebreaker.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.757
And your veil.
Yeah.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.392
Do it.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.393
I'll probably
just wear this.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.061
Really?
Okay.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.430
Well, a word of advice,

04:22.463 --> 04:23.731
unbutton that top button.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.399
Let those things breathe.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.067
Any message you want me
to relate to Jim?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.969
Um...

04:29.002 --> 04:30.804
Um.
Okay, um.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.872
Um.
You got that?

04:31.905 --> 04:32.873
I got it.
Write it down.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.675
Um.
Um....

04:34.708 --> 04:38.779
[both singing "Um"]

04:41.849 --> 04:44.618
There's my girl.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.054
I noticed you
handing out some shekels.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.922
How would one
get on that train?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.658
That was per diem
for Philadelphia.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.793
Ugh, that town
smells like cheese steaks.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.563
That town
is full of history.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.734
Andrea's the office bitch.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.003
You'll get used to her.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.739
Mmm.

05:05.773 --> 05:09.477
Creed.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.582
Can I have
my neck pillow back?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.750
Michael!

05:16.784 --> 05:19.353
Can I have
my neck pillow back?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.624
(Josh)
Hey, Michael.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.625
(Michael)
Hey, Josh, how you doing?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.659
Pretty good.
How you doing?

05:25.693 --> 05:26.860
Great to see you.
There he is.

05:26.894 --> 05:27.861
There's the traitor.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.896
Traitor!
Traitor!

05:28.929 --> 05:30.931
Come here, you.
Come here!

05:30.964 --> 05:33.467
Aaagh!

05:33.501 --> 05:35.769
The product--the progital...

05:35.803 --> 05:38.439
My son returns.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.507
I was shocked
when he told me

05:39.540 --> 05:40.674
he was transferring
to Stamford.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.842
It's like with firemen.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.545
You don't leave
your brothers behind.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.080
Even if you find out
that there is

05:47.114 --> 05:50.017
a better fire
in Connecticut.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.019
Really good
to see you, man.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.988
Yeah.
Wow.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.089
I didn't expect that.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.660
It's good to see you too.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.596
Oh, hey.
How's it going up there?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.665
Have you made
any sales yet?

06:04.698 --> 06:05.833
Yeah, sold about 40,000.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.868
Shut up.
That's impossible.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.069
No, it's not.
And I did.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.103
Yeah.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.706
Well, I did it too.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.842
You know,
when I saw Dwight,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.077
I realized how stupid
and petty

06:17.110 --> 06:20.681
all those pranks
I pulled on him were.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.950
And then he spoke.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.752
I wonder how hard it would be
to get a copy

06:24.785 --> 06:25.819
of his room key.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.755
So did you hear?

06:27.788 --> 06:28.789
What?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.123
Pam's back
on the market again.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.158
Really?
She's dating?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.694
Oh, if I weren't engaged,

06:33.727 --> 06:36.396
I would so hit that.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.102
So what kind of commissions
you get up there?

06:42.135 --> 06:45.706
Oh, Dwight,
I missed you so much.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.441
You're so immature.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.111
Listen, Michael, I heard you
were a great salesman.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.780
And I just wanna
let you know

06:52.813 --> 06:54.482
that if our branch
absorbs your branch,

06:54.515 --> 06:56.650
I'm gonna look for a place
for you in Stamford.

06:56.684 --> 06:57.651
Oh, hey!

06:57.685 --> 06:58.652
Hey, Jan.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.720
We all checked in?

06:59.753 --> 07:00.888
Yes.
Great.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.656
Let's dump our stuff
and meet back

07:02.690 --> 07:03.691
down here
in a half an hour.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.758
Okay.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.694
Jan?
[clears throat]

07:06.727 --> 07:08.128
Look, I think we need
to set some ground rules.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.863
What are you talking about?

07:09.897 --> 07:12.633
The 800-pound gorilla
in the room.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.868
Carol.
I'm still dating her.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.070
So nothing can happen
between us

07:17.104 --> 07:18.572
at the convention.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.607
Step away from me, Michael.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.944
Thank you for being
so brave with all of this.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.046
Thank you.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.719
[laughs mildly]

07:31.752 --> 07:33.887
Allen's cartoon
is so funny, right?

07:33.921 --> 07:34.888
Mm-hmm.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.690
And they're, like,
so smart.

07:36.724 --> 07:40.828
I don't even know
what they mean half the time.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.909
* This party
is gonna be awesome *

07:55.943 --> 07:57.778
* I know

07:57.811 --> 07:59.780
That is specifically
why I chose

07:59.813 --> 08:03.784
a room close to the elevator.
More foot traffic.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.519
Check it out.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.821
That is crooked
on that side.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.056
Wow.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.224
Hey hey!

08:11.258 --> 08:12.526
That is a lot of liquor.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.527
Yeah.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.494
And a dart board.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.763
Well, that's how
we do it in Scranton.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.798
Or did you forget?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.600
* Ain't no party
like a Scranton party *

08:19.633 --> 08:21.969
* 'Cause a Scranton party
don't stop *

08:22.002 --> 08:24.772
[both beat-boxing]

08:24.805 --> 08:26.840
We should probably
head on down, you know,

08:26.874 --> 08:27.841
hook up with Jan.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.842
Well, we have time.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.978
One for the road,
gentlemen?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.780
A shot of Midori, perhaps.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.849
[Jim laughing]

08:38.251 --> 08:39.653
Oh, no, sorry,
it's an inside joke.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.890
There was this bartender
in Stamford who...

08:42.923 --> 08:44.725
You know what?
You just have to be there.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.627
Wish I was.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.761
I love inside jokes.

08:47.795 --> 08:51.531
Love to be a part of one
someday.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.303
Um, we should...

08:56.336 --> 08:57.170
Yeah, all right.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.672
All right, see you guys
down there.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.973
See you guys.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.775
Change your mind,
come back up.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.076
I'll do a shot
with you, Michael.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.578
Yechh, don't be gross.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.113
It's not even lunch yet.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.251
SWAG!

09:11.284 --> 09:12.886
Stuff We All Get.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.756
I basically decorated
my condo for free

09:15.789 --> 09:18.358
with all of my SWAG!

09:18.391 --> 09:20.794
Check it out.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.763
Hi, I'm Michael Scott.
Dunder Mifflin.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.731
Dwight Schrute.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.832
Assistant Regional Manager,
Dunder Mifflin.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.099
I am a huge fan.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.334
Thanks.
I appreciate it, guys.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.268
You know what?

09:28.301 --> 09:30.804
I am having
a big blowout tonight, room 308.

09:30.838 --> 09:31.672
Hope you can come.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.673
I...maybe.
If I can.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.674
Well, cool!

09:33.707 --> 09:36.744
Okay, so can I tell people
you're gonna be there?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.278
No, you cannot.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.748
So maybe.
See ya.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.382
Why do they
call him The Bus?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.617
Because he's afraid to fly.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.085
Smile.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.020
Do you remember me
from last year?

09:47.054 --> 09:49.389
There's a party in my room,
308.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.791
Can't miss it.
Right off the elevator.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.325
Tonight.
Be there.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.326
[beeping]

09:53.360 --> 09:54.327
All right,
Jan just emailed me.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.196
She wants us
to meet her up front.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.131
Yep.
Yeah, she's up front.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.767
You don't have email
on your phone.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.236
I don't have to,
I just know.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.739
Yes, hello?

10:05.773 --> 10:06.907
No one just called you.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.709
All right, nice meeting you.
Take care.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.177
See you soon.
Take care.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.079
Bye-bye.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.347
May I have a moment
of your time, please?

10:15.816 --> 10:16.884
I need you to do something
for me.

10:16.917 --> 10:17.751
Yes, anything.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.953
I want you to
dig up some dirt on Josh.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.955
Find out if there are
any skeletons in his attic.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.857
I'll talk to my buddy
down at the station stat.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.827
Hey, Pam.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.228
Hey, what's up?
What's up?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.329
[phone ringing]

10:29.362 --> 10:30.698
I wanted to ask
if you wanted...

10:30.731 --> 10:33.433
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.404
He's not in the office.
Can I take a message?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.906
I will.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.775
You too.

10:41.809 --> 10:42.776
Sorry.
What's up?

10:42.810 --> 10:46.980
Um, if, uh...

10:47.014 --> 10:49.449
Um...

10:49.482 --> 10:54.021
I just completely forgot
what I was going to say.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.055
That's so weird.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.691
Okay.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.192
Well, if you think of it,
I'll be here.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.729
Okay.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.470
So I called my buddy
down at the station today.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.271
Mm-hmm.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.740
I had him
run a background check

11:12.773 --> 11:14.074
on Josh Porter.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.944
See if there's
any known aliases, etc.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.445
And?

11:18.478 --> 11:21.815
He wasn't
volunteering today.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.184
[exhales]

11:24.217 --> 11:26.153
Yeah.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.421
Things have been pretty crazy
around the office.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.489
Oh, yeah?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.991
Yeah.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.726
We moved Ryan
over to your desk.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.162
Oh.
Tell him I say hi.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.731
I will call him later
with that message.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.834
Hey, how's...
Toby?

11:40.868 --> 11:44.137
Toby Flenderson is everything
that is wrong

11:44.171 --> 11:45.906
with the paper industry.

11:45.939 --> 11:46.974
Is he why you left?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.776
Oh, no.
It was just...

11:48.809 --> 11:49.509
you know,
a good opportunity for me,

11:49.542 --> 11:50.310
a promotion.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.513
Opportunity, promotion.
Blah blah.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.148
You know, Jim,
those are just words.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.517
Have you taken into account

11:57.550 --> 11:59.186
other factors?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.353
Vis-à-vis bosses?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.422
Is Josh funnier than I am?

12:02.455 --> 12:03.490
Does he even
have a girlfriend?

12:03.523 --> 12:05.525
Because I have two,
basically.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.795
Michael, it's really not
a competition.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.799
Jim got a us a great lead
with a new rep

12:11.832 --> 12:12.665
from National Envelope.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.101
We can grab lunch
with him tomorrow.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.769
(Michael)
Hey, Jan.
Jan?

12:15.803 --> 12:18.005
Don't worry.
I have got the tip.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.339
Whoa, Michael.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.109
Wow.
Oh, my God, thank you.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.076
Is that your per diem?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.512
No, that was a different
hundred dollar bill.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.047
What have you generated,
Michael?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.482
I have generated
a lot of interest

12:29.516 --> 12:31.785
in my party this evening.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.253
What party?

12:33.286 --> 12:34.922
Party I'm having tonight
in 308.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.556
Obviously,
you are invited.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.827
Michael, um...

12:39.860 --> 12:41.962
Jim and Josh
are in meetings

12:41.995 --> 12:43.496
all day and I am

12:43.530 --> 12:47.100
in and out of meetings.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.702
I can't stay on top of you
24/7.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.842
[laughs]

12:54.875 --> 12:56.309
You should order

12:56.343 --> 12:58.311
the most expensive thing
on the menu.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.346
So he knows
you're worth it.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.316
If you do that,
you're gonna have to put out.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.387
Oh, yeah.
You'll have to put out.

13:09.089 --> 13:13.193
Is there a key
for Jane Doe?

13:13.226 --> 13:17.197
Thank you.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.500
Any messages for 308?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.302
All right.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.536
Hey hey, fellers.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.972
Michael.
Hey, Michael.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.039
Hey, what's up?

13:26.073 --> 13:28.008
Uh, well, Jim and I
have a meeting with Uniball

13:28.041 --> 13:29.542
in about 45 minutes,
so we should probably go.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.478
(Michael)
Hey, check this out.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.479
How about that?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.947
A little friendly competition.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.415
Stamford versus Scranton.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.583
I don't think so.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.118
Oh.
Jim?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.853
Looks like you picked
a bad time

13:39.887 --> 13:42.589
to defect, my friend.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.857
Fine.
All right.

13:43.891 --> 13:44.925
Okay.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.259
Excellent.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.095
[cell phone ringtone]

13:48.128 --> 13:49.196
Oh, just shut it.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.001
Hey, Pam, what's up?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.869
Yeah--uh, no.
Tell him I will give him

13:55.903 --> 13:57.470
general specifics tomorrow,
okay?

13:57.504 --> 14:01.008
Yes.
Say hi to Pam!

14:01.041 --> 14:02.542
[all]
Hi, Pam.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.144
Yes, that is Josh
and Dwight and Jim.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.612
Pam says hi.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.948
Have fun on your date.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.582
Very good.
Talk to you later.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.851
Bye.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.191
You first.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.594
Oh, nice try, Josh!

14:21.628 --> 14:23.997
Not.
Hit the rim.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.400
Okay, and...

14:27.434 --> 14:29.569
Okay, double or nothing.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.604
What, we didn't
bet anything, Michael.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.206
Well, let's...

14:33.240 --> 14:34.341
You know,
we should go.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.608
Come on, come on.
Come on!

14:35.642 --> 14:38.311
We'll do it later.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.047
Say, while I have you here,

14:40.080 --> 14:42.115
can I talk to you about
some new and exciting advances

14:42.149 --> 14:43.516
to our product line?
Fine.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.986
Jim and I have different
definitions of friendship.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.988
I think it's talking
and being friends

14:48.021 --> 14:50.323
and Jim thinks
it's moving to Connecticut

14:50.357 --> 14:52.192
and being best friends
with Josh.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.426
Well...

14:53.460 --> 14:56.029
phooey on that.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.065
I, uh...
I'm done.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.400
I am not going to be
speaking with him anymore.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.634
Whatevs.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.137
Long distance relationships
never work.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.573
That is so true.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.275
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.211
Okay, let me tell you
what we're looking for.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.280
(Michael)
Sorry, my meeting
ran late.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.316
Really?
Yes, Jan.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.550
Really.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.152
With a rep
from Hammermill.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.153
They're exclusive
with Staples.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.154
Used to be.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.555
Evan'll call you
in the morning

15:22.589 --> 15:24.224
to work out the details.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.592
We can now
sell Hammermill products.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.526
Yes!

15:26.559 --> 15:28.628
Ha!

15:28.661 --> 15:31.598
Well, Michael...

15:31.631 --> 15:32.632
I underestimated you.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.968
Yeah, well, maybe next time

15:35.002 --> 15:36.336
you will estimate me.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.475
Dwight's room key.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.045
And Dwight's room.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.547
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.082
(Angela)
D?

15:50.750 --> 15:54.121
Oh, my God.
Dwight got a hooker.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.722
Oh, my God,
I gotta call...

15:55.755 --> 15:56.990
I gotta call somebody.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.192
I don't even know
who to call.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.527
Dwight got a hooker!

16:00.560 --> 16:04.131
So, Allen, Pam is obsessed
with your cartoons.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.366
She reads them every day.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.135
Oh, great.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.202
I don't like ketchup.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.304
You love ketchup.
He loves ketchup.

16:11.338 --> 16:16.743
So how do you come up
with your cartoons?

16:16.776 --> 16:21.214
I just--I kinda think about
stuff that I see.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.283
Or dream them.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.718
You dream in cartoons?
How fun.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.024
(Michael)
Hey!
First guest!

16:31.058 --> 16:32.792
You are going to have
some tequila, my friend.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.528
Um, I thought there was
a party in here.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.529
This is the party.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.132
This is room 308?
Party central.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.101
So what can I
do you for?

16:41.134 --> 16:45.172
All right.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.707
See this one is great.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.410
Because it could work
on a couple different levels.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.578
Huh.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.714
[in French accent]
Your freedom fries
for the table.

16:54.747 --> 16:59.186
Freedom fries.
Yeah.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.687
Yeah.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.155
People always say, like,
don't be edgy.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.324
But, I don't know.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.525
I don't know
any other way.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.626
Oh.
[laughing]

17:06.659 --> 17:08.695
Yeah, you get it.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.279
Well, it was really nice
meeting you, Allen.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.181
Yeah, next time bring some of
your illustrations.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.682
I'll let you pick my brain.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.118
[laughing]

17:31.151 --> 17:32.519
More freedom fries.
Yeah.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.586
That's great.
Okay.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.622
I went on a date.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.757
It wasn't a love connection.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.860
Um, I think when
I like someone again,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.196
I'll just kind of know.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.162
People have been filtering
in and out.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.264
Can I get a drink?

18:17.297 --> 18:18.565
What?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.700
Can I get a drink?

18:20.733 --> 18:23.770
Sure.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.908
You like cosmos?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.444
Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.512
So why are you here?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.147
Is Josh busy?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.448

18:35.482 --> 18:36.716
I get it, you know?

18:36.749 --> 18:37.850
Did I do something?
No, I totally get it.

in sales.

We had some fun.

We had some laughs.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.728
Wait wait wait, I didn't
transfer because of you.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.231
You're a good boss.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.566
You're a great boss.

Pfff.

Not better than Josh.

18:58.905 --> 19:03.276
Michael, it's not about...

19:03.310 --> 19:04.777
I transferred
because of Pam.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.617
Oh, my God.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.585
You don't even know.
She's single now.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.488
No, I heard
something about that.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.923
It's just, I kind of

19:16.956 --> 19:20.627
put it all on the line.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.662
Twice, actually.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.732
And she said no.
Twice.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.901
[exhales]

19:28.935 --> 19:30.237
I'm sorry, man.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.604
I'm sorry.

19:31.638 --> 19:35.975
Hey, you know what?
I will talk to her.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.644
No, that's okay.
Yeah.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.246
That's all right.
I will.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.648
I'll talk to her.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.716
You should at least
talk to...Roy.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.752
I mean, he knows
exactly how you're feeling.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.689
Yeah.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.359
Okay, maybe.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.261
Are we early?

19:54.294 --> 19:55.362
Hey, no.
You know, people have been

19:55.395 --> 19:56.429
filtering in and out.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.764
Hey.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.499
Evan, this is Jim.
How are ya?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.934
Hey, Arnie Risman.
Michael, Jim.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.436
Hey, Arnie,
how you doing?

20:03.470 --> 20:05.272
You guys work together?

20:05.305 --> 20:06.639
No, we used to.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.575
Yeah.
Now, we're friends.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.778
Best friends.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.881
Some people
need dozens of friends

20:14.914 --> 20:17.450
to say, hey, look at me,
I'm popular.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.885
But not me.
I'm very picky.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.254
I need three.
Maybe two?

20:21.288 --> 20:23.423
When you meet
that someone special,

20:23.456 --> 20:24.791
you'll just know.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.827
Because
a real relationship...

20:27.860 --> 20:30.330
can't be forced.

20:30.363 --> 20:34.267
It should just come about
effortledlessly.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.435
Now, would you do me
the pleasure of

20:35.468 --> 20:37.870
hitting the lights, sir?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.474
Ha ha ha ha.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.675
Ha ha ha ha ha!

20:42.709 --> 20:46.479
Whoa.
What are all those stains?

20:46.513 --> 20:47.880
Blood, urine, or semen.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.749
Oh, God, I hope it's urine.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.785
