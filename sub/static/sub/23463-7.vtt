00:48.800 --> 00:52.680
Sometimes life is
shattered in an instant...

00:55.080 --> 00:56.470
.. and all our certainties

00:56.520 --> 00:58.640
are savagely stripped away.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.989
Questions become our weapons.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.440
Answers are our only hope.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.200
Without them, fear engulfs us.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.110
Love and each other

01:24.160 --> 01:26.800
can be all we have.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.350
- Are they sure?
- Almost certain,

01:41.400 --> 01:44.190
but the lumbar puncture should confirm it.

01:44.740 --> 01:46.710
The fact that Barbara has a rash

01:46.760 --> 01:49.350
that doesn't fade when pressed,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.230
suggests not only meningitis

01:52.280 --> 01:54.400
but a blood infection too.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.930
They've started her on
antibiotics immediately.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.530
- Can I see her?
- I'm afraid not.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.510
They have to keep her
isolated for the time being.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.250
They can't run the risk
of any further infection.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.650
Don't fret, lad.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.430
She's young and strong.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.430
That'll stand her in good stead.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.000
She's a fighter is our Barbara.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.610
There's a nip today, Fred Buckle,

02:35.160 --> 02:37.510
and I don't want you catching anything.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.040
Nursing is not my forte.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.220
Fred...

02:49.680 --> 02:51.500
.. give Tom my love.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.530
While Nurse Hereward is indisposed,
it's all hands on deck.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.870
The doctors are advising
every one of us here

03:02.920 --> 03:05.070
to take a course of antibiotics

03:05.320 --> 03:06.830
as a precaution.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.390
There will also be a prescription
offered to any mothers

03:09.440 --> 03:11.830
who have had close contact
with her in the last week.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.310
My mum's friend's youngest had meningitis.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.350
They went through a terrible time.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.190
- It was touch and go.
- Oh, dear, how dreadful.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.510
It was. But he's fine now.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.750
Nurse Crane, would you
please add me to the roster?

03:25.800 --> 03:29.390
We will all cover for Nurse
Hereward until she's back with us.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.830
Thank you, Sister. Right, Nurse Anderson,

03:32.880 --> 03:37.710
can you add Mrs Palmer from
Liverton Street to your list?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.960
Her baby's a week old
and Barbara was due...

03:42.280 --> 03:45.470
.. to make a home visit today.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.110
Of course.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.080
Good. Thank you.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.390
Right, I'm going. I'll call if
I hear any news about Barbara.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.790
Does Tom know how serious
meningococcal septicaemia is?

04:00.840 --> 04:03.030
He does, but he's in shock.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.030
Dad, can I go and see The
Rolling Stones tomorrow?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.670
They're on at the Regal.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.470
- Aren't they a bit...?
- What? - Undesirable.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.630
I'm going to watch them,
not make friends with them.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.589
It's not you I'm worried
about, it's their crowd.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.279
I'm late. We'll talk about it tonight.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.670
They have got a bit of
a reputation, Timothy.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.470
That's ridiculous.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.390
To be fair, he's being pulled
in all directions at the moment

04:30.440 --> 04:33.150
with the clinic, his
surgery, and Wadelock House.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.030
- What's Wadelock House?
- A remand home.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.670
He's covering for a
colleague there this week.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.230
Come along, ladies. Shift
yourselves before you take root.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.030
Nurse Crane, if you'd like me to
drive you to the hospital later,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.470
I'd be more than happy to
do it. You only have to ask.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.080
Thank you, very kind, but no, thank you.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.790
No change.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.950
But keep a close eye.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.510
If the colour in her fingers or toes
deteriorates any further, call me.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.200
Yes, Sister.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.670
Two, three, four, five.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.110
Star jumps for ten on me! Ready? Go!

06:10.160 --> 06:13.670
One, two, three, four,

06:13.720 --> 06:17.790
five, six, seven, eight...

06:17.840 --> 06:22.190
Ah, Dr Turner, good to have you on board.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.550
I'm afraid you're about to earn your keep.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.870
We have a galloping outbreak
of our old friend scabies.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.390
Ah, well, in that case,
all bedding and clothing

06:31.440 --> 06:34.950
will have to be washed in boiling
hot water then dried with heat.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.790
Don't worry, we know the drill.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.430
Welcome to Wadelock House.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.480
One, two, three...

06:46.320 --> 06:47.950
How is she?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.310
Erm... much the same.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.910
We need to give the penicillin
a chance to do its work.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.310
But she's holding her own, and
that's something to take heart from.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.830
Can I sit with her? Just
for a few minutes? Please.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.910
I need to see her for myself.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.950
I'm sorry.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.030
I know it's hard, but you
won't be of any help to her

07:10.080 --> 07:13.550
- in her present condition.
- Please don't let her die.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.110
We are doing everything in
our power to prevent it.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.870
I have great faith in our
doctors, Mr Hereward.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.680
As much as you have in God, I suspect.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.440
You can come back this evening.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.030
Ah! Good morning, Nurse...

07:47.080 --> 07:50.270
Anderson. I'm afraid Nurse
Hereward is sick today

07:50.320 --> 07:51.870
and I'm covering some of her patients.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.910
Oh, what a shame. I had a
little gift to give to her too.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.510
You know, just to thank her
for the gift she's given me.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.270
You can give it to me and
I'll make sure she get it.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.920
Look at me, keeping you on the
doorstep. Come in, come in.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.150
Ah, shoes off... if you don't mind.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.070
It's a brand-new carpet.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.430
Winston -- he's my husband --
said we should get the linoleum,

08:17.480 --> 08:19.550
but I had my heart set.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.190
We'll be in the back room, Nurse.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.670
I only have the heating on
in the front room on a Sunday.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.510
You sound like my mother.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.190
Your mother sounds like
a very smart woman.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.430
- Where are you from, Nurse? In Jamaica?
- Manchester. You?

08:31.480 --> 08:32.880
St Catherine.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.240
Now, that should keep you busy.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.630
Right.

08:42.679 --> 08:46.310
Let me get myself settled
and then I'll have you in.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.000
One at a time.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.430
Has he been crying more than usual?

08:57.480 --> 08:59.390
He never cries.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.590
- He's the best baby in the
whole world. - I'm sure.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.310
And what about you? Are you feeling well?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.750
No sign of a rash or stiff neck?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.590
Why? Could we have caught this?

09:09.640 --> 09:11.710
It's unlikely, but we'd like you both

09:11.760 --> 09:15.280
to take a course of antibiotics,
just to be on the safe side.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.390
It's really nothing to worry about.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.870
Your baby is thriving, Mrs Palmer.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.630
He's put on 2oz since Nurse
Hereward last weighed him.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.110
- All he does is eat.
- That's what he meant to do.

09:30.160 --> 09:34.030
- That and sleep. - I hope he slows
down, just for a little while.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.550
Otherwise, he'll be bursting
out of his christening robe.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.190
And what will your father
think if he has to bless you

09:40.240 --> 09:44.000
and accept you into God's
love naked as you came?

09:45.560 --> 09:48.590
My husband is the pastor of our church.

09:48.640 --> 09:52.190
We've waited a very long time
to thank God for our child.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.630
That's lovely. Where is your church?

09:55.680 --> 09:57.190
You are standing in it.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.830
My husband's congregation is a small one.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.990
We gather in the front room,
read the Bible, pray together.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.630
When we first came we
attended a larger church,

10:06.680 --> 10:09.790
with a fancy altar, big congregation, but

10:09.840 --> 10:12.670
their hearts were not so big.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.910
Our church is not like that.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.710
- You go to church, Nurse?
- I do,

10:18.760 --> 10:20.910
- but I'm thinking of changing.
- Ah.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.630
- So you know what I am saying.
- No. Nothing like that.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.230
You're welcome to pray with
us. It's a squeeze, but...

10:27.280 --> 10:30.030
It's kind, but I think I
will be too busy working

10:30.080 --> 10:32.670
until Nurse Hereward
is up and about again.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.950
Well, this door is always open,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.720
like at home.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.640
Right, so you are Michael Sumpter? Yes?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.160
Let's take a look at you.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.790
Hmm. You have a mild dose of scabies.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.390
Nothing much.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.760
The lotion should clear
it up fairly quickly.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.590
This cut's infected.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.920
How did you do this?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.190
I'll dress it for you now.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.230
Then come in again tomorrow

11:13.280 --> 11:15.800
and I'll change it.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.720
It stings. Sorry.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.310
What's that for?

11:36.360 --> 11:38.030
Visiting time, sir.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.990
You'd better go, then.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.670
I don't get no visitors.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.750
Doesn't your family visit?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.720
I don't have no family.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.470
Oh, Tom, you're soaked.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.990
Sister Grant sent me home.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.110
You took a lot of notice, then.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.030
I'll go back there tonight,

12:03.080 --> 12:04.670
after visiting.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.750
I don't think I can face
it yet. Not on my own.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.910
I know. I had a feeling this might happen.

12:10.960 --> 12:15.230
Here -- a bit of sustenance
and clean clothes.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.830
We can't let standards slide.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.600
I'll try my best.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.310
There's no change, Phyllis.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.550
It's early days and no
change cuts both ways.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.950
She's no worse, Tom.
Think of it like that.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.400
I know how much you love her...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.640
.. and how much she loves you.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.230
Here, Sumpter, is it true you
and your bird are having a kid?

12:44.280 --> 12:46.750
What happened? You forget to pull out?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.110
Surprised you put it in.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.950
She's not my bird. She's my wife.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.230
- Look, he talks!
- And sticking up for a tart and all.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.960
What do you say? Go on, say it again!

13:01.160 --> 13:02.960
Get off me! Get off!

13:14.720 --> 13:17.310
Did you know that Mrs
Palmer's husband was a pastor?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.870
Oh! How interesting.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.710
- Where's his church?
- In their little flat.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.350
The congregation comes to
him and they worship there.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.070
- Gosh. - We are not judged
by the size of our churches,

13:29.120 --> 13:31.520
but the way we inhabit them.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.160
Sister, you're not wearing your glasses.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.510
How peculiar.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.630
They must have fallen off.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.430
It's a sign.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.310
- Perhaps they do not like it there.
- No matter.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.270
We'll find them.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.670
Now, come along, eat up.

13:50.720 --> 13:55.110
Strangely... I find myself
devoid of the ability

13:55.160 --> 13:57.120
to partake in this nourishment.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.590
I am old.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.800
I have had my time, yet
here I am, sight renewed...

14:06.600 --> 14:10.040
.. while our beloved
friend is stricken so.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.590
I would gladly let the Good Lord take me

14:14.640 --> 14:17.550
if he would spare her.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.150
He does not trade one precious
soul for another, Sister.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.040
It is not his way.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.680
Aren't you cold out here?

14:36.920 --> 14:39.590
Now you mention it.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.320
Hard day?

14:43.640 --> 14:46.230
There's a local boy in there,

14:46.280 --> 14:48.910
same age as Tim.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.270
He troubles me.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.760
I can hardly get two words out of him.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.630
There are scars on his wrist, Shelagh.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.630
He's clearly depressed,

15:02.680 --> 15:05.360
but there doesn't seem
to be any help in there.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.430
He doesn't strike me as the usual type.

15:10.480 --> 15:14.030
I saw him defending his
wife's honour today.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.870
His wife?

15:15.920 --> 15:18.830
And she's pregnant.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.880
Can you imagine how he must
feel, locked up, away from her?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.550
I wish I could get him to open up to me.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.120
Would you like me to find out if his
wife is a patient at Nonnatus House?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.430
Their name is Sumpter.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.640
I'll check in the clinic.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.950
- Where's Tim?
- Orchestra.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.550
- It's Monday, remember.
- Ah.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.840
He should be back about seven.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.950
Did you get some sleep, Mr Hereward?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.910
I have a confession, Sister.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.870
I didn't even go home.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.870
I'll sit here, and I promise not to move.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.520
I just have to be here when she wakes up.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.030
I've sat at the bedside
of so many dying people,

16:10.080 --> 16:12.350
some of them in this very hospital,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.600
surely I can be near my own wife?

16:16.160 --> 16:19.270
She's still very ill, but she's calmer

16:19.320 --> 16:21.600
and not as feverish as she was.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.950
If you wear a mask and gown,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.360
I'll let you in to sit
with her for a few moments.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.630
Just sit with her.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.920
I have a feeling she'll know you're here.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.430
Where have you been? You're late.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.240
Orchestra.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.470
Till this time? It's nearly ten!

17:16.520 --> 17:18.869
We were worried.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.069
I almost called the police.

17:21.119 --> 17:24.430
You're not allowed out with
your friends again until I say.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.589
That's not fair. They're all going
to see The Rolling Stones tomorrow.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.110
Good for them.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.120
Hope they get out in one
piece. Now, go to bed.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.430
- Phyllis...
- Yes?

17:54.480 --> 17:57.230
Would you like me to pray with you?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.470
For Barbara.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.990
Please don't think me ungrateful.
Pray all you like for Barbara,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.350
but don't ask me to do it.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.480
I'll just do what I am doing, quietly.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.110
I might have put my foot in it last night.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.510
Why? I asked Phyllis if she wanted
to pray with me for Barbara.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.110
I knew she wouldn't want to,
so I don't know why I did it.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.310
It would be like asking you.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.670
You were being kind. Phyllis'll know that.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.710
If I'm honest, I think
it was more for my sake.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.430
I like to pray with other people.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.150
It's how I was brought up.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.670
I can understand that.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.680
Everything feels so fragile right now.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.160
There must be a comfort in it.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.430
If you want some company
on the bus this Sunday,

18:56.480 --> 18:58.630
I'm happy to tag along.

18:58.680 --> 19:02.000
I can always go for a wander
when you go to church.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.360
That's kind of you, but let's
see how Barbara is first.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.120
Oh...

19:14.920 --> 19:17.590
Nurse Crane, why don't you let myself

19:17.640 --> 19:20.430
and the other midwives share
your cases between us?

19:20.480 --> 19:22.910
I'm sure you'd rather be at the hospital.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.310
I think I'd prefer to carry on for now,

19:25.360 --> 19:26.630
but perhaps later.

19:26.680 --> 19:30.510
What do you think about asking
Mrs Turner to come back?

19:30.560 --> 19:34.190
Could be the perfect solution.
If she's willing, of course.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.000
We can but ask.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.710
How's your hand?

19:40.760 --> 19:42.960
Hey, look -- Sumpter's boyfriend.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.590
I need to change your dressing.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.160
Can you come up to the medical
room when you're finished here?

19:53.920 --> 19:57.710
- Oooh, Medical room.
- Oooh!

19:57.760 --> 20:00.350
He's been right as rain,
nurse. Not up or down.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.910
That's good. I wanted to make sure.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.680
I forgot to give you
this, for Nurse Hereward.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.270
Oh, that's pretty.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.110
Nurse Hereward will love it.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.160
My mother collects little glass ornaments.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.430
You miss her, don't you?

20:19.480 --> 20:21.550
Yes,

20:21.600 --> 20:24.360
but my work is here, and I love it.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.870
Which reminds me, I have clinic today.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.880
We have a prayer meeting this evening.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.150
Thank you, but I have
choir practice tonight.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.560
We don't have a choir,
but we love to sing.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.600
Goodbye, Mrs Palmer.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.270
That's looking better.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.030
If you like, I can ask them

20:49.080 --> 20:51.510
to take you off gardening
duty for a few days.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.960
Nah, I like going outside.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.590
I saw those other boys provoking you.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.470
Does it happen often?

21:01.520 --> 21:03.230
It happens to everyone.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.200
I ain't anything special.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.310
You hear what they said?

21:08.360 --> 21:09.910
About Alison.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.990
Is Alison your wife?

21:12.040 --> 21:14.390
Called her a tart.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.640
- She isn't.
- I'm sure she isn't.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.960
Don't know what she saw in me.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.760
Her mother says I'm good for nothing.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.150
She didn't want her to marry me,

21:26.200 --> 21:30.630
but she didn't want a bastard
in the family so she let her.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.670
All she cares about is what people think.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.430
Where's Alison now?

21:36.480 --> 21:38.550
Living with her.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.870
Couldn't afford a place of our own.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.110
Must be hard.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.910
At least she's not stuck with
some good-for-nothing waster

21:45.960 --> 21:48.550
who's going to be in and out of
jail for the rest of his life.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.870
Did Alison say that?

21:50.920 --> 21:53.830
No. I did.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.120
But I bet she thinks it.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.230
Tom,

22:03.280 --> 22:05.150
you look terrible.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.310
Thank you.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.120
How is she?

22:10.960 --> 22:13.230
She's still not awake,

22:13.280 --> 22:15.350
but the fever's come down a bit.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.870
- The sister says that's good.
- It is.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.600
What did I tell you? She's a strong lass.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.910
I've bought her some clean
nightclothes. And this is for you,

22:27.960 --> 22:31.390
from Fred. It's a razor.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.790
And if I were you, I'd use it.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.590
You don't want Barbara waking up
and getting the fright of her life

22:36.640 --> 22:39.510
because your facial hair has
taken on a life of its own.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.950
Wouldn't that be something?

22:42.000 --> 22:45.150
For Barbara to wake up and look at me

22:45.200 --> 22:47.240
in the way that she does.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.750
Looks like the word's out.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.230
This is Poplar, Fred.
The word is always out.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.270
They must think a great deal of Barbara.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.470
They do.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.470
They think of her and Tom as family.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.830
That's a lovely thing,

23:16.880 --> 23:20.070
especially as they're not from here.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.280
Very lucky.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.030
I saw Sister Julienne today.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.710
She asked me to come back to
Nonnatus House and work with them

23:47.760 --> 23:50.670
- while Barbara's in hospital.
- What did you say?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.510
I said I had to talk it over with you.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.720
We'll manage.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.790
I checked at clinic

23:58.840 --> 24:02.190
and there isn't anyone
called Sumpter on their books.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.350
That's a shame.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.950
I hope she hasn't moved away.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.200
That would make things harder for Michael.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.430
I was about to send out a search party.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.280
I went for a walk.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.870
Here.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.760
Just for a few minutes, mind.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.190
We're satisfied there's
no risk of infection now,

24:41.240 --> 24:42.840
so you don't have to wear a mask.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.190
You can talk to her if you
like, but keep your voice down.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.910
She's very drowsy still, so
don't expect her to talk back.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.070
Nurse will be in and out.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.640
If you need anything, ring the bell.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.400
Oh, darling.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.920
My poor darling.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.160
Your hand's cold.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.270
Everyone sends their love.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.310
I've been thinking

25:27.360 --> 25:30.270
about when you're better.

25:30.320 --> 25:34.230
I know we both love it here, but
I think it's time for a change.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.880
Don't you?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.080
Let's move to the country...

25:42.160 --> 25:46.510
.. with fields and streams,

25:46.560 --> 25:48.960
and hills as far as we can see.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.630
And a little cottage
that opens up onto grass

25:53.680 --> 25:55.960
and not onto a fog-filled street.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.560
Somewhere safe.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.200
Somewhere to bring up a family.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.160
Folk have babies in the country.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.320
Some of them even go to church.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.720
It brings a whole new
meaning to the word flock.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.600
Hello.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.120
Oh, you gave me a fright.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.920
You need a shave.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.670
- Phyllis said you'd say that.
- Mm.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.320
Phyllis knows everything.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.910
Do you want some?

27:02.960 --> 27:04.520
Yes, please.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.470
Lucille, what you said before,

27:09.520 --> 27:12.150
about Tom and Barbara being lucky,

27:12.200 --> 27:15.920
it made me worry you still
don't feel welcome here.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.000
I'd hate that.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.710
It's not here.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.560
It's at church.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.190
Why? What's happened?

27:30.240 --> 27:33.440
I only went there because of Sybil,
and she made me join the choir.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.030
But then the choir master gave me a solo.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.430
I thought you said you
couldn't hold a tune.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.760
My mother tells me never to boast.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.950
Anyway, some people there
wasn't too happy about it.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.030
Some people thought it
wasn't the done thing

27:51.080 --> 27:55.030
to have the likes of me stand
up, on my own, and be seen.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.070
Don't go back.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.790
Isn't that the easy way?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.590
Part of me thinks I should stay

28:01.640 --> 28:04.190
and not be cowed by
their ignorant behaviour.

28:04.240 --> 28:07.440
I should stand up there in front
of them all and sing my heart out.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.950
Why don't you go to Mrs
Palmer's prayer meetings instead?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.350
I think they sound lovely.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.240
They do, they sound so much like home.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.470
But I'm living in England
now and I should be

28:20.520 --> 28:22.150
trying harder to fit in here.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.600
Nonnatas House. Midwife speaking.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.470
Oh, Mr Hereward...

28:29.520 --> 28:31.720
- Go.
- How is everything?

28:35.880 --> 28:37.470
Oh.... that's wonderful!

28:37.520 --> 28:39.470
That's so wonderful.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.630
I'll tell everyone.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.240
Night.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.230
Barbara's come round.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.640
We can go and visit her!
Isn't it just so wonderful?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.790
Now, I've allocated you
each a time to visit

29:21.840 --> 29:24.510
which does not interfere
with your nursing duties.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.510
You are allowed five minutes each.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.670
Remember, Barbara is still very weak.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.030
Are we all agreed?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.430
- We are. - We are.
- We are. - Splendid.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.910
If only all rotas were
as welcome as this one.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.310
- Mrs Turner!
- Welcome back, Nurse Turner.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.670
Thank you. It is only temporary,
till we get Barbara back.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.470
I've pulled together a list of your calls.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.880
First up is Miss Wetherley.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.710
How does that feel?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.040
More like my Tom.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.630
to make sure everything
is progressing normally.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.990
Do you have to examine me?
I feel fine, don't I, Mum?

31:24.040 --> 31:26.630
Course, you do. You're
neither up nor down with it.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.070
I was the same. I hardly
knew you were in there.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.070
- Are you still planning to
give birth here? - Course she is.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.630
Why wouldn't she? This is where she lives.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.110
- I just have to ask.
- She's going nowhere.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.070
Not as long as I've got breath.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.270
I don't like to think where
you might have been living

31:41.320 --> 31:43.000
- if it was up to that...
- Mum!

31:47.760 --> 31:49.720
Your hand is healing nicely.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.390
If those lads are bothering you,

31:54.440 --> 31:57.270
I could have a word
with the superintendent.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.790
I'll be out of here soon.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.310
I'm up in front of the magistrates
the day after tomorrow.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.590
You could be going home.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.350
I stole a car.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.080
I'm not going home.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.190
Why did you do it?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.880
Got a kid on the way.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.270
A bloke turned up with some keys,

32:16.320 --> 32:19.710
told me to drive it up to Stepney
and he'll pay me for doing it.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.550
Next thing I knew, the police had me.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.440
- Are you sorry?
- What do you think?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.320
Then tell them that.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.000
I don't have the right words.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.670
They tie me in knots.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.830
Tell me. I'll help you.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.950
You don't need big words,

32:39.000 --> 32:40.680
just the truth.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.800
Go on.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.160
I'm sorry for doing it,
cos it was stupid...

32:51.000 --> 32:54.750
.. but I just wanted to look
after my wife, and I'd rather die

32:54.800 --> 32:57.480
than take money off her
mother, the old bag, I mean...

32:58.600 --> 33:01.350
See. I can't say that. I can't do it.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.150
I just don't have the right words to use.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.150
You could say it in a different way.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.040
You could. I can't.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.350
It doesn't matter.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.960
What kind of a father would I be anyway?

33:16.200 --> 33:18.710
You got kids?

33:18.760 --> 33:21.440
Three. Two boys and a girl.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.470
My eldest son is the same age as you.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.630
Bet he's not in trouble.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.320
- He is at the moment.
- What did he do?

33:32.720 --> 33:35.310
He stayed out later than he should.

33:38.680 --> 33:41.070
Is that all?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.790
What did you do to him?

33:43.840 --> 33:47.560
I told him he couldn't see
his friends for a few days.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.750
I wish I was going up in front of you.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.040
You sound like an all right dad.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.040
Where's your dad?

34:00.320 --> 34:02.640
Buggered off before I were born.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.080
Like father like son.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.830
The baby's lying
perfectly, Miss Wetherley.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.790
The head is down and engaged.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.510
It might not be long now.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.989
It's not Miss, it's Mrs...

34:20.040 --> 34:23.550
Mrs Wetherley? I thought
that was your mother's name.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.949
Wetherley is my maiden name.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.870
I was Mrs Sumpter, but
I go by Wetherley now.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.630
I don't want you thinking I
wasn't married or anything.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.190
Sumpter?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.670
Why? What's wrong with that?

34:36.719 --> 34:40.909
Nothing, but I think there's
something you should know.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.030
My husband is a GP at
Wadelock House just now.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.880
He's met your husband.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.270
Don't say a word to my mum.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.630
If she finds out, there'll be hell to pay.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.190
She can't stand him.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.320
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.840
Did you go to Mrs Palmer's prayer meeting?

35:09.160 --> 35:11.710
Why not?

35:11.760 --> 35:14.990
She remind me too much of
my mother and her sisters

35:15.040 --> 35:18.270
and everything I miss from home.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.000
Makes me ache.

35:22.840 --> 35:28.000
If it was me, and I was that way
inclined, I'd be there like a shot.

35:33.800 --> 35:37.910
Oy, Sumpter, want a drag?

35:52.520 --> 35:54.750
Why can't I speak for him?

35:54.800 --> 35:58.750
Because then we would have to do
it for all of them, and we can't.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.390
How they feel is not our concern.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.110
We're only interested
in what they've done.

36:04.160 --> 36:09.070
All that boy needs is for
somebody to show some faith in him.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.550
Just once. That's all.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.630
Can I give you a piece of advice?

36:13.680 --> 36:16.190
The same advice that
somebody once gave me.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.590
You can't save them all,

36:18.640 --> 36:21.400
and you'd have nothing left if you tried.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.030
I'll go. You look tired.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.440
Get some sleep before Tom comes.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.120
Let him know if there's
anything you want me to bring.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.520
Phyllis...

36:45.760 --> 36:48.200
.. look.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.280
These are worse, aren't they?

36:59.360 --> 37:01.800
I can't feel anything with them either.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.960
I'll go and get Sister Grant.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.230
That was Nurse Crane.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.350
The tissue on three of Nurse
Hereward's fingers has been

37:31.400 --> 37:34.270
badly affected by the septicaemia.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.030
They won't know how much tissue
is dead or has been badly damaged

37:37.080 --> 37:39.070
for a while yet.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.470
Could she lose them?

37:41.520 --> 37:43.670
It's possible.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.030
She's a midwife.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.910
She won't be able to do her job.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.510
Not if she can't feel anything.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.040
No.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.030
What are you doing with that?
Does it need dry cleaning?

38:11.080 --> 38:13.950
No. It's for Michael.
He'll need it for court.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.110
- Does Timothy know you've taken it?
- I'm only borrowing it.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.270
- Patrick...
- Don't worry.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.240
I'll see you at the maternity home later.

38:25.920 --> 38:29.190
Look, hand-knitted.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.830
You'd never know I got it in a jumble.

38:30.880 --> 38:33.030
Don't go buying anything else.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.350
It'll grow out of everything
before it can wear them all.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.590
Appearances matter, Alison,
especially in your situation.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.870
I will not have people talking
about you or my grandchild

38:41.920 --> 38:46.230
just because you were stupid enough
to get swept away by a fly-by-night.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.750
You're not the first,
you won't be the last.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.830
No wonder this country's gone to the dogs,

38:50.880 --> 38:53.510
because girls like you
can't tell the difference

38:53.560 --> 38:57.190
between that thing and proper affection.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.030
Well, it's a good thing we won't
have to worry about him after today.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.510
He'll be well away by the
time that baby's here.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.630
- What do you mean?
- He's in court today,

39:05.680 --> 39:08.750
facing up to what he did.
There's no hiding now.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.310
- How do you know that?
- I've been keeping tabs.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.670
Now, content yourself.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.080
You'll upset the baby.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.240
Are you tired, darling?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.600
Do you want me to go?

39:32.800 --> 39:35.120
You must always hold my hand.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.590
Even if I can't feel you,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.480
I'll remember your touch.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.640
All I ever wanted to be was a midwife.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.120
Ever since I was little.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.560
I wanted to bring babies into the world.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.120
But if that's not to
be, then it's not to be.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.990
And I'll just have to be
the best curate's wife

40:12.040 --> 40:15.630
in the history of curate's wives.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.070
Remember what you said about
moving to the country?

40:19.120 --> 40:21.710
I didn't know you'd heard me.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.360
Maybe it was a dream...

40:25.440 --> 40:28.960
.. but if it was, it was
the most wonderful dream.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.950
I don't have to give up on babies, Tom.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.200
Not when we have our own.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.990
That day we got married,

40:48.040 --> 40:50.840
and I was all wrapped up in my cloak...

40:52.560 --> 40:55.320
.. that was the safest I've ever felt.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.480
And that's because of you, Tom.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.520
Bring in my engagement ring later.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.120
The grass one?

41:11.120 --> 41:13.440
The grass one.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.240
All stand.

41:31.160 --> 41:33.110
- Excuse me, miss.
- I just want to go in.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.510
- No, sorry, you can't come in here.
- I'll sit at the back.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.670
I'm sorry, miss. You
can't. You have to leave.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.270
He's my husband!

41:39.320 --> 41:41.630
- Michael, I'm sorry.
- You have to wait outside.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.230
Why can't I just go in?

41:43.280 --> 41:45.430
Go to her. She's upset. Please.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.390
I thought you wanted me to stay.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.040
I'll be all right.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.040
Alison...

41:57.920 --> 41:59.670
I'm Dr Turner.

41:59.720 --> 42:02.070
I've been working at Wadelock House.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.600
I've been trying to help Michael.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.950
Are you all right?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.390
I need to sit down.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.990
I've had a gripey tummy all night.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.910
You might be in labour, Alison.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.670
We need to get you to the maternity home.

42:19.720 --> 42:22.230
I'll call an ambulance.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.040
Please don't let anything
bad happen to the baby.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.400
I did take that car. I did...

42:33.680 --> 42:35.790
.. but I wish I hadn't.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.600
More than anything, I wish I hadn't.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.910
I know it was wrong,

42:42.960 --> 42:46.310
but sometimes you don't know what's
wrong until you've done it and

42:46.360 --> 42:48.710
then it's too late.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.390
You need someone to show you where
you're going wrong before you do it,

42:52.440 --> 42:55.110
and I don't have anyone like that,

42:55.160 --> 42:56.670
or I didn't.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.550
But I'm married now.

42:59.600 --> 43:03.430
If you give me another chance, I swear...

43:03.480 --> 43:07.320
I swear I'll make good,
for her and our baby.

43:17.520 --> 43:22.670
I have heard your statement and
believe you are remorseful.

43:22.720 --> 43:27.230
However, I do not feel you are ready
to face your responsibilities.

43:27.280 --> 43:30.790
I am therefore sentencing
you to three years.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.960
Consequently, you will shortly
be moved to a juvenile prison.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.470
She was at the court.

43:41.520 --> 43:44.190
Contractions are coming
in every four minutes,

43:44.240 --> 43:45.910
but she's doing very well.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.710
Well done, Alison. That's it.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.470
- It hurts so much.
- Breathe nice and deep.

43:50.520 --> 43:54.270
That's it. Well done.
You're doing so well.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.990
Do you want us to get your mum?

43:56.040 --> 43:58.880
No. Not yet.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.550
That's it. good girl.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.470
Baby's going to be here very soon.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.360
Big push.

44:14.520 --> 44:18.750
- Good girl!
- It hurts so much!

44:18.800 --> 44:20.230
Shall we get your mum?

44:20.280 --> 44:23.310
No! I want Michael.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.910
- I want Michael.
- Alison, as soon as your baby is born,

44:26.960 --> 44:29.470
Dr Turner will make sure Michael knows.

44:29.520 --> 44:32.040
- Promise?
- Promise.

44:50.800 --> 44:54.510
On the next contraction, I want you
to give me small controlled pushes.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.310
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

44:56.360 --> 45:00.870
You're nearly there and
you're doing so well. So well.

45:00.920 --> 45:04.070
That's it. Just one small push.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.760
Lovely. And another.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.560
Now, pant.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.190
Oh, well done!

45:16.800 --> 45:18.910
Baby's head's born.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.950
Push again and we'll have baby.

45:25.160 --> 45:27.190
Well done, Alison!

45:27.240 --> 45:28.550
Well done.

45:28.600 --> 45:32.000
You've got a perfect baby boy.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.110
Let me see him. Let me see him.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.230
See.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.440
Perfect.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.030
Well done, Alison.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.240
He looks just like his dad.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.440
Michael!

46:17.120 --> 46:19.470
You've got a little boy.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.350
A boy?

46:21.400 --> 46:23.910
And he's perfect, Michael.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.990
- Alison...
- She was wonderful.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.870
She sent me here to tell you, Michael.

46:29.920 --> 46:33.320
She wants you to know that
he looks just like you.

46:36.360 --> 46:40.430
I know three years must
feel like a life sentence,

46:40.480 --> 46:42.990
but it's up to you.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.030
You're a dad, now.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.720
You've got someone to prove it to.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.920
I'm not getting better, Phyllis.

46:59.640 --> 47:03.080
As long as I've known you,
you've never hidden from anything.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.630
I've learnt a lot from you

47:07.680 --> 47:10.000
and I didn't think there
was much left to learn.

47:11.400 --> 47:14.950
There's nothing anyone can teach you
about caring for people, Phyllis.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.670
Not sure everyone would agree with that.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.000
Well, they don't know you like I do.

47:22.720 --> 47:25.960
This next bit is going to be hard.

47:29.160 --> 47:32.000
I hate seeing the people I love upset.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.120
We'll do our best.

47:44.600 --> 47:47.550
- Is that my suit?
- Yes.

47:47.600 --> 47:50.710
Did you go into my room and
take it? Without asking me?

47:50.760 --> 47:54.190
Imagine if I'd done that. I probably
wouldn't be allowed out for a year.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.590
I'm sorry. I should've asked.

47:57.640 --> 48:01.080
- I would have given it to
you. You know that. - I know.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.630
But we weren't speaking,

48:06.680 --> 48:09.350
and I wanted to help one
of the boys at Wadelock.

48:09.400 --> 48:12.230
He was up in court and he
didn't have anything to wear.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.150
That's not an excuse.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.920
I know.

48:19.720 --> 48:21.950
What happened to him?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.320
He got sent to an approved school.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.830
- How old is he?
- Same age as you...

48:28.880 --> 48:30.870
.. but he seemed much older.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.040
I'm not a child any more either.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.920
Sometimes it's hard for
a dad to accept that.

48:39.480 --> 48:42.110
You will always be my little boy.

48:42.160 --> 48:43.800
Dad!

48:45.560 --> 48:47.630
I am sorry you missed that concert.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.870
It's a good thing they're coming
back then, at the end of the month.

48:50.920 --> 48:52.470
Good.

48:52.520 --> 48:55.590
- I'll come with you.
- Rather go with my mates.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.110
I don't blame you.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.110
Midwife speaking.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.910
Valerie, it's Tom.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.830
Please tell Phyllis to meet
me at the hospital right away.

49:39.880 --> 49:41.560
Phyllis!

49:55.760 --> 49:58.200
Tom...

50:02.280 --> 50:06.390
I'm afraid that the septicaemia
has caused irreversible damage.

50:06.440 --> 50:08.760
There's nothing more that we can do.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.280
Oh, Barbara.

50:40.920 --> 50:43.790
I love you so much.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.840
My life has been blessed
to have you in it.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.160
I can't bear to let you go.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.910
Talk to her, Tom.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.160
She can still hear you.

51:45.080 --> 51:47.520
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

51:48.520 --> 51:51.480
He maketh me lie down in green pastures.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.360
He leadeth me beside still waters.

51:58.760 --> 52:01.200
He restoreth my soul.

52:02.360 --> 52:05.080
He leadeth me in paths of righteousness.

52:07.360 --> 52:10.270
Yea, though I walk

52:10.320 --> 52:13.520
through the valley of the shadow...

52:23.600 --> 52:27.350
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

52:27.400 --> 52:29.710
I will fear no evil,

52:29.760 --> 52:32.190
for thou art with me.

52:32.240 --> 52:35.400
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

52:37.240 --> 52:40.190
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

52:40.240 --> 52:42.190
all the days of my life,

52:42.240 --> 52:45.880
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord for ever.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.790
She's gone.

54:57.400 --> 55:01.000
- Am I too late?
- No-one is ever late in God's eyes.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.390
- Is everybody very hungry?
- Yes, Father.

55:13.440 --> 55:15.790
All right, we got you some
good food in a minute, right?

55:15.840 --> 55:17.440
Not too much, son, I'm watching you.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.370
You better watch.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.930
Welcome! Welcome to our gathering, sister.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.670
Everybody! Amazing grace...

55:26.720 --> 55:27.990
Yes.

55:28.040 --> 55:32.070
.. how sweet the sound that
saved a wretch like me.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.160
- Amen.
- Amen.

55:36.120 --> 55:42.630
♪ Amazing grace

55:42.680 --> 55:49.990
♪ How sweet the sound

55:50.040 --> 55:57.350
♪ That saved a wretch

55:57.400 --> 56:04.950
♪ Like me

56:05.000 --> 56:12.310
♪ I once was lost

56:12.360 --> 56:19.550
♪ But now I'm found

56:19.600 --> 56:23.550
♪ Was blind

56:23.600 --> 56:31.600
♪ But now I see. ♪

56:35.560 --> 56:37.830
Love cannot always save us,

56:37.880 --> 56:40.840
but it can be the reason why we fight.

56:48.800 --> 56:53.070
Then love becomes the wound that bleeds.

56:53.120 --> 56:56.310
The space to be filled.

56:56.360 --> 57:00.400
The emptiness that echoes into silence.

57:10.440 --> 57:12.470
The world doesn't stop.

57:12.520 --> 57:14.430
We've got work to do, haven't we?

57:14.480 --> 57:16.750
Do you reckon you might be
a bit old to be doing this?

57:16.800 --> 57:18.510
Do you reckon you might be too young?

57:18.560 --> 57:22.470
Anniversary of my own birth
will doubtless go unmarked.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.710
Have a good look, and tell
me what you think has gone.

57:24.760 --> 57:25.950
I want to go home now.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.640
You will find a way. I promise you.
