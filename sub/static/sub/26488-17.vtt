It's not enough you charmed

01:20.107 --> 01:22.636
I have a roundtable
on Pacific climate migration

01:22.637 --> 01:23.956
to get to the second we land.

01:23.957 --> 01:27.357
Until then, I am milking every last
drop of this vacation.

01:27.381 --> 01:29.259
Well, we're still in vacation
mode till we're back in D.C.

01:29.283 --> 01:32.562
playing with Lyric before
we Netflix and chill.

01:32.586 --> 01:33.763
Okay.

01:33.787 --> 01:35.732
Oh, wait, that's still vacation mode.

01:35.756 --> 01:38.442
Aaron and I don't get back
to work until tomorrow,

01:38.443 --> 01:41.755
where I will tell Sam all about
this amazing woman we met.

01:41.779 --> 01:44.158
- Ah.
- I swear, he's the future Mr. Daisy.

01:44.182 --> 01:46.227
Aw. Tara, you're a mess.

01:46.251 --> 01:48.229
- Promise me we'll keep in touch.
- Oh, yeah.

01:48.253 --> 01:49.500
We'll see each other back in D.C.
for sure.

01:49.501 --> 01:50.397
Fly safe.

01:50.421 --> 01:51.599
- Okay. Bye, guys. Say "bye-bye."
- Bye.

01:51.623 --> 01:53.443

Hey, folks, welcome

02:01.332 --> 02:03.043
to Washington Dulles Airport.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.412
There's gonna be a slight delay
here on the ground,

02:05.436 --> 02:07.815
so we'll need everyone to remain
in their seats.

02:07.839 --> 02:10.151
We thank you in advance
for your patience.

02:10.175 --> 02:12.253
I wonder what that's about.

02:14.279 --> 02:16.257
Attention, please.

02:16.281 --> 02:17.958
I'm Team Leader Carl Burke

02:17.982 --> 02:19.126
from the Department
of Homeland Security.

02:19.150 --> 02:20.327
Due to an exposure

02:20.351 --> 02:22.329
to the measles virus on this aircraft,

02:22.353 --> 02:24.064
we'll be performing
some routine screenings

02:24.088 --> 02:26.500
and, if need be,
take containment measures.

02:26.524 --> 02:27.801
Please remain seated

02:27.825 --> 02:29.860
while we move
to a secure holding terminal.

02:30.895 --> 02:32.673
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

02:42.006 --> 02:43.984
Hi.

02:44.008 --> 02:45.686
I'm Dr. Kerry Still. Daisy Grant.

02:45.710 --> 02:47.655
- You're with the CDC?
- Yes. We're going to need

02:47.679 --> 02:50.124
- to do a closer exam...
- I work for the Secretary of State.

02:50.148 --> 02:51.825
You know, I understand CDC protocols,

02:51.849 --> 02:53.260
and I'm happy to cooperate,

02:53.284 --> 02:54.562
but I really need to get to work.

02:54.586 --> 02:56.931
I understand, but we need to do

02:56.955 --> 02:58.365
- a closer examination.
- Look, Joanna and I

02:58.389 --> 03:00.134
have already been
vaccinated for the measles.

03:00.158 --> 03:02.102
So tell me to keep an
eye out for symptoms,

03:02.126 --> 03:03.737
give me a pamphlet
with the contact info,

03:03.761 --> 03:05.706
and we'll get out of your
hair so you can focus

03:05.730 --> 03:07.775
on the people who brought
the virus onto the plane.

03:07.799 --> 03:10.277
Miss Grant, you are the people.

03:10.301 --> 03:12.313
- Excuse me?
- This morning,

03:12.337 --> 03:15.115
a case of measles was confirmed
on your cruise ship.

03:15.139 --> 03:16.417
We are now trying to track down

03:16.441 --> 03:18.485
all 4,500 passengers and crew members,

03:18.509 --> 03:21.322
plus everyone
you've come into contact with

03:21.346 --> 03:23.791
since you disembarked
in order to prevent a pandemic.

03:23.815 --> 03:25.759
I'm sorry for the delay,

03:25.783 --> 03:27.695
but we need to do a closer examination

03:27.719 --> 03:30.965
- of you and your daughter.
- I'll let the office know I'll be late.

03:30.989 --> 03:32.433
So, uh,

03:32.457 --> 03:35.302
any early news about how
the conference is going?

03:35.326 --> 03:36.770
- Don't answer that, Nina.
- Would you...

03:36.794 --> 03:38.539
- Since...
- Don't an...

03:38.563 --> 03:41.375
Well, I know. Yep.

03:41.399 --> 03:43.900
Jay's got it.

03:44.969 --> 03:47.348
Did you tell him the thing
about Australia?

03:47.372 --> 03:50.417
How it's all about flattering
the prime minister's ego,

03:50.441 --> 03:52.786
and it's... You did.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.644
Well, good.

03:55.613 --> 03:57.791
All right. Disengaging

03:57.815 --> 04:02.062
in three, two, one!

04:02.086 --> 04:03.330
Whoa.

04:03.354 --> 04:04.565
The countdown. Haven't heard that

04:04.589 --> 04:06.356
since Jason went to summer camp.

04:07.358 --> 04:09.903
This conference is the key

04:09.927 --> 04:13.274
to a whole global climate
migration initiative.

04:13.298 --> 04:15.009
- It's...
- And it's in good hands.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.744
You're right.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.803
This is Jay's moment to fly.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.919
What if I-I get to Camp David,
and I'm just sitting around,

04:25.943 --> 04:28.522
wondering why I had to put
my entire life on hold

04:28.546 --> 04:30.391
just to write a ten-minute speech?

04:30.415 --> 04:32.459
Because it's a ten-minute speech
that's gonna define

04:32.483 --> 04:34.461
your campaign and your presidency.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.463
And you said yourself,

04:36.487 --> 04:37.865
you can't do it
on nights and weekends.

04:37.889 --> 04:39.667
Conrad's sending a chef.

04:39.691 --> 04:42.269
What, you were gonna fast
in the desert for 40 days?

04:42.293 --> 04:44.772
Well, it just seems so elaborate.

04:44.796 --> 04:47.841
You know, I can make a sandwich.

04:47.865 --> 04:50.644
Remember that passage
from A Room of One's Own

04:50.668 --> 04:52.413
where Virginia Woolf

04:52.437 --> 04:55.049
takes a page
to describe the delicious meal

04:55.073 --> 04:56.550
the privileged men of England
get to eat

04:56.574 --> 04:57.584
so they can run the world?

04:57.608 --> 04:59.953
And the women get biscuits and prunes.

04:59.977 --> 05:01.922
Yeah.

05:01.946 --> 05:04.658
So you're saying I should just enjoy

05:04.682 --> 05:06.126
the trappings of male privilege?

05:06.150 --> 05:08.128
I'm saying the president
of the United States

05:08.152 --> 05:10.130
understands the value of a good meal.

05:10.154 --> 05:12.499
So yes, just enjoy it.

05:12.523 --> 05:16.303
I don't know if I can stick
to this "no phone calls" rule.

05:16.327 --> 05:17.705
What if I get stuck?

05:17.729 --> 05:19.239
Babe, just go for a walk.

05:19.263 --> 05:21.241
Take deep breaths.
You're gonna be great.

05:21.265 --> 05:23.677
And you'll edit me as
soon as I get back?

05:23.701 --> 05:25.779
Oh, I'll edit you.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.681
- That's so weird.
- I know.

05:27.705 --> 05:29.277
- You're really weird.
- Nice and weird.

05:29.278 --> 05:30.751
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

05:30.775 --> 05:32.742
Put that away.

05:34.712 --> 05:36.690
Considering the devastating effects

05:36.714 --> 05:38.892
of this current typhoon season

05:38.916 --> 05:41.095
on Nauru and the Solomon Islands,

05:41.119 --> 05:42.396
it's clear that our predictions

05:42.420 --> 05:45.099
about the long-lasting effects
of climate change

05:45.123 --> 05:47.101
are no longer predictions.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.168
They're here.

05:48.192 --> 05:49.803
The U.N.'s Regional Compact

05:49.827 --> 05:51.572
for Climate Migration

05:51.596 --> 05:53.240
would enable us to work together

05:53.264 --> 05:56.276
to manage, process and relocate

05:56.300 --> 05:59.213
the millions expected to be
displaced by rising sea levels

05:59.237 --> 06:01.315
in Pacific Rim nations.

06:01.339 --> 06:02.850
If this is about climate change,

06:02.874 --> 06:04.585
let the big polluters
take the millions.

06:04.609 --> 06:05.753
It is our greatest hope

06:05.777 --> 06:09.022
to extend the regional
compact to a global one,

06:09.046 --> 06:11.959
which would include
all major carbon emitters.

06:11.983 --> 06:13.127
One of which

06:13.151 --> 06:14.928
is cohosting this conference.

06:14.952 --> 06:18.031
The United States is ready
to take our share

06:18.055 --> 06:19.133
of climate migrants.

06:19.157 --> 06:20.768
We are all interested to hear

06:20.792 --> 06:23.137
what you consider your share.

06:23.161 --> 06:24.705
We all share the effects
of climate change.

06:24.729 --> 06:25.873
A plan of action is essential.

06:25.897 --> 06:28.876
But I agree with President Andrada.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.043
Australia is already overburdened

06:30.067 --> 06:32.312
with illegal asylum seekers.

06:32.336 --> 06:33.814
And now climate migrants?

06:33.838 --> 06:36.650
We had a recent huge influx
from the Solomon Islands.

06:36.674 --> 06:37.951
We also have boat people

06:37.975 --> 06:40.721
coming every day
from Palau and Tuvalu.

06:40.745 --> 06:42.055
I know you all

06:42.079 --> 06:43.757
have refugee fatigue.

06:43.781 --> 06:45.793
But I must ask us all to bear in mind

06:45.817 --> 06:47.961
that many of these people
have lost their homes

06:47.985 --> 06:49.263
and everything they have.

06:49.287 --> 06:50.998
They travel at great risk
to Indonesia,

06:51.022 --> 06:53.534
only to find their request for asylum

06:53.558 --> 06:56.336
won't be processed for months,
if ever, and their only option

06:56.360 --> 06:59.239
for shelter is a tent on the sidewalk.

06:59.263 --> 07:01.809
Then someone says their uncle

07:01.833 --> 07:05.078
got asylum in Australia,
so they spend their last pennies

07:05.102 --> 07:07.147
for a spot on an unseaworthy boat

07:07.171 --> 07:09.650
and journey 200 miles
over rough waters.

07:09.674 --> 07:12.619
Many of them
do not even survive the trip.

07:12.643 --> 07:16.056
This is a humanitarian crisis
that isn't going away

07:16.080 --> 07:18.559
because the world is changing.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.260
And we're here to figure out

07:20.284 --> 07:22.262
- how to change along with it.
- We'd be looking

07:22.286 --> 07:24.631
to Australia for first wave
temporary shelter.

07:24.655 --> 07:26.200
We're already the way station.

07:26.224 --> 07:28.368
And your infrastructure and expertise

07:28.392 --> 07:31.305
are exactly why your leadership
is essential, Prime Minister.

07:31.329 --> 07:33.407
You know the challenges
inside and out.

07:33.431 --> 07:35.375
Uh, Jay, it's urgent.

07:35.399 --> 07:36.777
I need to speak with you.

07:36.801 --> 07:38.612
Uh, excuse me a moment.

07:38.636 --> 07:40.547
If we all turn

07:40.571 --> 07:41.915
to section "B."

07:41.939 --> 07:44.184
POTUS wants you at the CDC briefing.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.752
- But we just got some momentum.
- Okay.

07:45.776 --> 07:48.055
That one measles case.
It looks like an outbreak.

07:48.079 --> 07:50.224
Right. Okay.

07:50.248 --> 07:52.025
I guess, uh, I guess you're up.

07:52.049 --> 07:53.760
- Okay.
- If Australia agrees to the deal,

07:53.784 --> 07:55.295
the rest of the nations will follow.

07:55.319 --> 07:57.354
I got this.

07:58.489 --> 08:00.234
We're gonna land Australia.

08:00.258 --> 08:01.535
I can feel it.

08:01.559 --> 08:03.704
- I love the optimism.
- But?

08:03.728 --> 08:05.939
They throw out prime ministers
like confetti down there,

08:05.963 --> 08:08.242
and Lawson's party is all over
him for being too liberal.

08:08.266 --> 08:10.611
Jay. He'll only sign if we give
him something big in return.

08:10.635 --> 08:12.079
Sorry. Uh, Daisy just called.

08:12.103 --> 08:14.715
With stories of romance and
adventure on the high seas?

08:14.739 --> 08:18.274
And of the Dulles Airport
quarantine station.

08:19.277 --> 08:20.587
We're fine.

08:20.611 --> 08:22.589
It's protocol to check everyone.

08:22.613 --> 08:24.725
Hey, so, how you doing
in the driver's seat?

08:24.749 --> 08:27.594
Uh, g-great, I think.

08:27.618 --> 08:29.596
How's Joanna holding up?

08:29.620 --> 08:32.164
Well, they took blood, and
baby girl is not happy with me.

08:32.188 --> 08:33.600
I know.

08:33.624 --> 08:38.105
The switch from "I love you"
to "how could you" is so fast.

08:38.129 --> 08:39.306
God, she's gonna hold a grudge.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.041
Thankfully, my mom
will have to deal with it.

08:41.065 --> 08:42.109
I'll see you at the conference

08:42.133 --> 08:43.243
when I drop her off.

08:43.267 --> 08:44.645
Don't be crazy. You're going home.

08:44.669 --> 08:45.812
I mean, of course I can come in.

08:45.836 --> 08:46.980
The Dulles quarantine station

08:47.004 --> 08:48.348
is not how you end a vacation.

08:48.372 --> 08:50.017
Go home. We got this.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.919
Well, if you insist, boss man.

08:51.943 --> 08:53.053
All right, keep me posted.

08:53.077 --> 08:54.377
Okay.

08:56.847 --> 08:58.124
You got the outbreak folder?

08:58.849 --> 09:00.093
Yep.

09:00.117 --> 09:02.996
All set. Sorry. Uh...

09:03.020 --> 09:05.599
I just thought I'd check
my Dogoda Crush inbox,

09:05.623 --> 09:07.367
- and I got sucked in.
- To the right

09:07.391 --> 09:08.602
for Mr. Right, right?

09:08.626 --> 09:09.836
Yeah. There's a lot more wrongs

09:09.860 --> 09:11.238
on these apps.

09:11.262 --> 09:15.008
Although this guy's a... He's a maybe.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.209
What do you think?

09:16.233 --> 09:17.644
He likes his nephew, which is cute.

09:17.668 --> 09:20.080
He works at DOJ with a friend of mine.

09:20.104 --> 09:21.915
She thinks he's a player.

09:21.939 --> 09:24.885
Sometimes I love
how small this town is.

09:24.909 --> 09:26.486
Good-bye, Mitchell.

09:26.510 --> 09:28.622
I met my husband the old-fashioned way

09:28.646 --> 09:30.223
at an inaugural ball.

09:30.247 --> 09:32.759
Wow. I need to go to more balls.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.697
Oh, my God.

09:36.721 --> 09:38.755
Who was that?

09:40.491 --> 09:42.970
It's my Uncle Will.

09:42.994 --> 09:46.039
He and my Aunt Sophie are going
through a rough patch right now.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.674
He's been living in our basement.

09:47.698 --> 09:49.977
It says he's not looking for love,

09:50.001 --> 09:51.111
- just a good time.
- Oh, my God.

09:51.135 --> 09:52.946
That is so much worse.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.815
Gators, recounts,

09:54.839 --> 09:57.718
and now measles. Is there
anything good about Florida?

09:57.742 --> 10:01.054
Miami is the only major city
founded by a woman.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.724
Doesn't make up for the measles.

10:03.748 --> 10:05.726
Passengers and crew

10:05.750 --> 10:06.793
from over 20 different countries.

10:06.817 --> 10:08.528
That's quite a spread.

10:08.552 --> 10:10.030
We've got quarantine facilities
up and running

10:10.054 --> 10:11.164
at all major points of entry.

10:11.188 --> 10:13.433
Measles was eradicated in the U.S.

10:13.457 --> 10:15.268
How are we back here?

10:15.292 --> 10:16.737
Well, sir, because measles is awesome.

10:16.761 --> 10:18.438
At being a virus.

10:18.462 --> 10:21.708
It's not as sexy as Ebola,
but it is even more contagious.

10:21.732 --> 10:24.711
The pathogens, they can survive
in the air for up to two hours

10:24.735 --> 10:27.447
after the infected person
has left the room.

10:27.471 --> 10:29.316
Ebola is sexy?

10:29.340 --> 10:31.118
Yes. But with measles,

10:31.142 --> 10:33.720
one person can infect 12 to 18 others,

10:33.744 --> 10:37.891
which is why vaccine hesitancy
is such a public health hazard.

10:37.915 --> 10:40.394
People are not getting
their kids vaccinated.

10:40.418 --> 10:42.996
And this virus, it actively
seeks out the unvaccinated.

10:43.020 --> 10:45.565
Bright side, we may have determined

10:45.589 --> 10:47.034
the country of origin.

10:47.058 --> 10:49.302
The person who brought the virus
on board the Sea Foam Voyager

10:49.326 --> 10:51.204
- was one of the ship's housekeepers.
- 12 days ago,

10:51.228 --> 10:53.340
she got back from a trip
to the Philippines,

10:53.364 --> 10:55.042
where there's rumored
to be an outbreak.

10:55.066 --> 10:56.610
Why is it a rumor?

10:56.634 --> 10:58.345
The Philippines hasn't reported

10:58.369 --> 11:01.114
any cases of measles to the WHO,

11:01.138 --> 11:03.717
and they're not allowing them
in to investigate it.

11:03.741 --> 11:05.719
WHO can't contain an outbreak

11:05.743 --> 11:08.044
if they can't confirm
where it started.

11:12.616 --> 11:15.328
Okay. I'm starting
to understand why I'm here.

11:15.352 --> 11:18.198
You want me to try to get
Andrada to work with us.

11:18.222 --> 11:19.499
Tread carefully, Jay.

11:19.523 --> 11:20.867
Yes, Mr. President.

11:20.891 --> 11:22.502
Okay, so, we've been
back-channeling with the Aussies.

11:22.526 --> 11:24.237
- They want to make a deal.
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

11:24.261 --> 11:25.405
In exchange for their full support,

11:25.429 --> 11:27.674
they want us to double
the number of work visas

11:27.698 --> 11:29.443
- for their citizens.
- Oh, is that all?

11:29.467 --> 11:31.378
Well, Lawson needs
something bright and shiny.

11:31.402 --> 11:33.480
So his party won't call him
soft on immigration.

11:33.504 --> 11:35.652
Well, if visas are shiny
enough, let's look into it.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.250
All right, we'll have
to get DHS, Congress

11:37.274 --> 11:38.618
- and the White House on board.
- Yep.

11:38.642 --> 11:40.287
- Should we check in with M-Sec?
- She's off the grid.

11:40.311 --> 11:42.189
The only way to get to her
is through Dr. McCord.

11:42.213 --> 11:43.957
- I don't think we need to pull
that rip cord. Blake? - All right.

11:43.981 --> 11:45.625
- I'll get started on the legwork.
- What about Andrada?

11:45.649 --> 11:46.793
Are we good for a sit-down?

11:46.817 --> 11:48.662
I haven't heard back
from his people yet.

11:48.686 --> 11:50.486
He's dodging us.

11:52.389 --> 11:55.936
Best of all, it slices
through bone like butter.

11:57.561 --> 11:59.172
President Andrada, excuse me.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.007
- Hate to interrupt.
- Then don't.

12:01.031 --> 12:03.009
Can I get a word?

12:03.033 --> 12:05.378
- I don't talk to errand boys.
- Contact my staff.

12:06.737 --> 12:08.882
Anyone eating these dumplings?

12:08.906 --> 12:12.185
I'm so busy hosting,
I keep forgetting to eat.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.821
You know how that is.
Would you pass the hot sauce?

12:14.845 --> 12:17.457
You guys hear about the...

12:17.481 --> 12:19.493
measles outbreak?

12:19.517 --> 12:21.928
We leave those matters
to our ministers of health.

12:21.952 --> 12:24.831
It's turning into a whole thing.

12:24.855 --> 12:27.634
Lots of departments involved,
all because the...

12:27.658 --> 12:31.138
country of origin...
the Philippines...

12:31.162 --> 12:33.039
Oh!

12:33.063 --> 12:35.675
Wow. That's hot.

12:35.699 --> 12:37.644
Anyway, the Philippines
isn't cooperating

12:37.668 --> 12:39.846
with the World Health
Organization, which is really...

12:39.870 --> 12:41.848
messing up global efforts to control

12:41.872 --> 12:44.251
the further spread of a
highly contagious disease

12:44.275 --> 12:46.853
- that could kill children.
- That... that is ridiculous.

12:46.877 --> 12:48.455
That's what I said.

12:48.479 --> 12:51.625
It's got to be a bureaucratic screwup.

12:51.649 --> 12:54.027
My boss is out of town.
Maybe I should let it go.

12:54.051 --> 12:56.196
Under normal circumstances,
you know what, I probably could.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.165
But once you're looking
at a global outbreak...

12:58.189 --> 13:00.433
I mean...

13:00.457 --> 13:02.135
there are consequences.

13:02.159 --> 13:03.703
Arms deals get reconsidered.

13:03.727 --> 13:06.162
Aid packages come under scrutiny.

13:08.899 --> 13:11.178
I had a pocketknife
when I was a Boy Scout.

13:11.202 --> 13:12.746
Wasn't as cool as that one, though.

13:12.770 --> 13:13.880
Anyway...

13:13.904 --> 13:16.372
see you guys back at the conference?

13:22.112 --> 13:23.857
♪ Mama's little Jo ♪

13:23.881 --> 13:25.725
♪ The bestest little Jo ♪

13:25.749 --> 13:27.360
♪ In the whole wide ♪

13:27.384 --> 13:29.196
- ♪ Whoa! ♪
- How we doing in here?

13:29.220 --> 13:30.931
Thank you so much for the coffee.

13:30.955 --> 13:32.833
Suddenly this room
doesn't seem so bad.

13:32.857 --> 13:35.502
So, we have your results.

13:35.526 --> 13:37.771
Mom is all clear.

13:37.795 --> 13:41.174
Joanna, however,
tested positive for measles.

13:41.198 --> 13:42.242
What?

13:42.266 --> 13:44.644
No. No, she got the shot.

13:44.668 --> 13:47.647
After one dose, about 93%
of people are protected.

13:47.671 --> 13:50.183
That's why we do
the booster at age four.

13:50.207 --> 13:53.084
- I can't believe this.
- Because she's contagious,

13:53.085 --> 13:56.531
we're moving both of you to
a quarantined medical facility.

13:56.555 --> 13:58.800
She's gonna be okay, right?

13:58.824 --> 14:01.602
We'll do everything we can
to get her through it, but...

14:01.626 --> 14:04.662
she is going to get very sick
over the next few days.

14:09.805 --> 14:15.387
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

14:15.974 --> 14:17.251
How can there be no treatment?

14:17.275 --> 14:20.108
The virus just has to run its course?

14:20.109 --> 14:21.720
- I mean, what is that?
- I don't know.

14:21.744 --> 14:23.055
I can't imagine.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.079
- Poor Daisy.
- Joanna had

14:25.080 --> 14:27.525
the first immunization...
that's got to help, right?

14:27.549 --> 14:28.993
Let's hope.

14:29.017 --> 14:30.628
Hey. Well, just got confirmation

14:30.652 --> 14:32.363
of the outbreak in the Philippines.

14:32.387 --> 14:34.799
All I had to do was threaten
his aid package and arms deals.

14:34.823 --> 14:36.167
Actually, Andrada is blaming

14:36.191 --> 14:39.437
the outbreak on the recent
climate migrants. Publicly.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.072
Oh, and now Australia is pulling out

14:41.096 --> 14:43.307
- of the roundtable.
- Because...

14:43.331 --> 14:45.076
migrants have measles.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.510
Okay, here he is.

14:46.534 --> 14:49.680
We took these people in
because we wanted to help.

14:49.704 --> 14:52.583
They repaid us with measles.

14:52.607 --> 14:53.584
Oh, this guy.

14:53.608 --> 14:55.019
The U.N. demands that we bring in

14:55.043 --> 14:56.687
these so-called "climate migrants"

14:56.711 --> 14:58.589
into our countries.

14:58.613 --> 15:02.026
But does that mean we have
to accept their crime...

15:02.050 --> 15:04.729
their disease?

15:04.753 --> 15:06.764
Okay, well, Andrada's
single-handedly tanking

15:06.788 --> 15:08.065
this whole agreement,

15:08.089 --> 15:10.234
- and without Australia there's no deal.
- Hard to know

15:10.258 --> 15:12.737
what's worse,
the measles or the xenophobia?

15:12.761 --> 15:14.872
Can you get me Lawson's schedule?

15:14.896 --> 15:16.374
Absolutely.

15:16.398 --> 15:18.532
Back to work.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.345
Smells really good.

15:21.369 --> 15:24.582
I was expecting you and Will
to be having some kind of...

15:24.606 --> 15:26.851
sad bachelor meal.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.652
Nope. Nothing but gourmet.

15:28.676 --> 15:30.154
Sorry to disappoint.

15:30.178 --> 15:32.923
- Is he around?
- Uh, I haven't seen him.

15:32.947 --> 15:34.525
Why? What's up?

15:34.549 --> 15:35.883
Oh, God.

15:37.552 --> 15:39.797
So, you know that dating app

15:39.821 --> 15:41.388
- that I'm on?
- Still?

15:42.390 --> 15:45.392
Look who I saw on there today.

15:49.097 --> 15:50.174
Yeah. Whoa.

15:50.198 --> 15:51.842
Right? What is he thinking?

15:51.866 --> 15:53.577
What is he wearing?

15:53.601 --> 15:55.379
He looks like a Danish veterinarian.

15:55.403 --> 15:57.748
I guess that's...
how you dress when you're

15:57.772 --> 15:59.884
"super laid-back and love to laugh."

15:59.908 --> 16:01.052
Who is he?

16:01.076 --> 16:03.054
- I mean...
- We have to do something, right?

16:03.078 --> 16:04.855
- I mean, he can't be on there.
- Honey,

16:04.879 --> 16:06.490
he's a grown man.

16:06.514 --> 16:08.893
Come on. Mom would kill him.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.561
Well, the benefit
of Mom being out of town

16:10.585 --> 16:12.125
is there's less murder in the house.

16:14.522 --> 16:18.169
If someone shows this to Aunt Sophie,

16:18.193 --> 16:19.904
which they totally could,

16:19.928 --> 16:22.506
any chance of them
working it out is done.

16:22.530 --> 16:25.709
And we're stuck with
Will in the basement.

16:25.733 --> 16:27.701
I'm just saying.

16:30.138 --> 16:32.550
I'm not saying Australia's
pulling out of the deal.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.452
I just want to wait until we know more

16:34.476 --> 16:35.786
about the origin of this outbreak.

16:35.810 --> 16:37.588
Even though the WHO has no evidence

16:37.612 --> 16:39.256
linking measles to any migrants?

16:39.280 --> 16:41.459
Well, they don't know
where it came from.

16:41.483 --> 16:44.061
It seems a vast increase
in illegal migrants

16:44.085 --> 16:46.931
from the Solomon Islands is an
entirely likely explanation.

16:46.955 --> 16:49.366
Really? So now we're making
international policy

16:49.390 --> 16:51.302
based on what seems likely?

16:51.326 --> 16:54.438
I can't sell a migrant deal
to my people with this...

16:54.462 --> 16:56.440
miasma of disease hanging over it.

16:56.464 --> 16:57.808
Let's just...

16:57.832 --> 16:59.376
table this until your boss gets back.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.611
Shall we?

17:00.635 --> 17:02.847
So, if we find conclusive proof
that the migrants

17:02.871 --> 17:04.949
aren't the source of the outbreak,

17:04.973 --> 17:06.817
- you're back at the table?
- Well, as I said,

17:06.840 --> 17:08.685
double the current number
of work-stay visas,

17:08.710 --> 17:10.554
and that's an offer I'll consider.

17:10.578 --> 17:11.955
Excuse me.

17:11.980 --> 17:15.425
"Miasma of disease"?

17:15.450 --> 17:16.527
China and Russia just pulled out.

17:16.550 --> 17:17.661
Damn it, this whole thing's

17:17.685 --> 17:19.396
- falling apart.
- Jay, they only had

17:19.420 --> 17:21.499
one toe in to begin with.
Listen, l-let me just try

17:21.522 --> 17:24.201
to hold on to everyone else while
we get Australia back. Okay?

17:24.224 --> 17:26.069
Look, if we can prove the
migrants aren't the source

17:26.094 --> 17:27.570
- of the outbreak, that will...
- Hang on.

17:27.595 --> 17:29.607
I think I may have
a contact I can try.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.276
I just have to see if she's
still in the Ministry of Health

17:32.300 --> 17:34.545
in the Philippines.

17:34.569 --> 17:37.148
I thought that was you.

17:37.172 --> 17:39.083
Tara, oh, my God.

17:39.107 --> 17:40.751
How did you know we were here?

17:40.775 --> 17:42.553
We're here, too.
Right across the hall.

17:42.577 --> 17:43.854
Oh, no. Lyric?

17:43.878 --> 17:45.689
They quarantined our flight
as soon as we landed.

17:45.713 --> 17:47.858
- I thought she had a cold.
- Yeah, Joanna started

17:47.882 --> 17:49.026
with the same symptoms.

17:49.050 --> 17:50.794
Can't believe we
just have to wait it out.

17:50.818 --> 17:51.996
At least we can

17:52.020 --> 17:53.998
- get through it together.
- What are the odds

17:54.022 --> 17:56.167
that two vaccinated kids
get the measles?

17:56.191 --> 17:57.268
See?

17:57.292 --> 17:58.969
You can stop beating yourself up.

17:58.993 --> 18:00.404
She might've gotten sick anyway.

18:00.428 --> 18:01.972
Oh, you guys didn't...?

18:01.996 --> 18:03.574
Not the MMR.

18:03.598 --> 18:05.109
Medical reasons?

18:05.133 --> 18:06.477
Philosophical.

18:06.501 --> 18:08.913
- I never thought she'd be exposed.
- I guess the way

18:08.937 --> 18:11.382
it works is, three out of
every hundred people or so

18:11.406 --> 18:13.951
can still get infected even
if they've had the full MMR.

18:13.975 --> 18:16.086
But if everybody gets vaccinated,

18:16.110 --> 18:18.589
then those people are protected
by herd immunity.

18:18.613 --> 18:21.014
It only works when
enough people immunize.

18:27.155 --> 18:28.832
Francine, hi.

18:28.856 --> 18:30.467
Oh, looks like we...

18:30.491 --> 18:31.769
caught you at home?

18:31.793 --> 18:33.804
Ah, still living the glamorous
life of public service.

18:33.828 --> 18:37.174
Look at you at the State Department.

18:37.198 --> 18:39.310
She throw any furniture yet?

18:39.334 --> 18:40.611
We're keeping her very happy.

18:40.635 --> 18:41.612
All right, all right.

18:41.636 --> 18:43.347
So listen, this measles outbreak.

18:43.371 --> 18:45.015
Your president is accusing migrants

18:45.039 --> 18:48.118
from the Solomon Islands of
bringing it into the Philippines.

18:48.142 --> 18:51.055
Does that match what,
uh, you're seeing

18:51.079 --> 18:52.790
at the Department of Health?

18:52.814 --> 18:55.793
If that is
President Andrada's position...

18:55.817 --> 18:58.796
Fran, look, a deal that
we're working on is at risk.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.864
Can you... can you give me any proof?

19:00.888 --> 19:03.534
The migrant population
has been difficult to track.

19:03.558 --> 19:04.735
Well, if you could allow

19:04.759 --> 19:06.837
the World Health Organization
access, then,

19:06.861 --> 19:08.572
to do its own surveillance...

19:08.596 --> 19:10.241
I'll have to get back
to you about that.

19:10.265 --> 19:12.142
It's time-sensitive.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.477
I mean, even just the locations

19:13.501 --> 19:15.379
of the most recent outbreaks
would be helpful...

19:15.403 --> 19:17.348
It was good to talk to you.
I'll let you know.

19:17.372 --> 19:19.984
Fran, Francine, um,
how old is Jaslene now?

19:20.008 --> 19:21.952
Oh, she's four.

19:21.976 --> 19:25.155
Wow. My kid Desi just turned four.

19:25.179 --> 19:27.858
And, uh, our press secretary's
daughter Joanna,

19:27.882 --> 19:32.196
um, is almost two, and she was

19:32.220 --> 19:33.731
on the Sea Foam Voyager.

19:33.755 --> 19:38.035
She's one of the nine kids
who have been infected so far.

19:38.059 --> 19:41.605
Fran... not knowing the
full story of the outbreak

19:41.629 --> 19:43.340
in the Philippines...

19:43.364 --> 19:45.476
it puts all our kids at risk.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.079
Are you seriously using my
daughter to put pressure on me?

19:49.103 --> 19:51.181
Shame on you, Kat.

19:52.874 --> 19:54.574
Well, that took a turn.

19:57.312 --> 19:59.123
Oh, my God.

19:59.147 --> 20:01.225
Look. Look.

20:01.249 --> 20:03.394
That...

20:03.418 --> 20:05.796
is a map of the outbreak.

20:05.820 --> 20:06.797
Mmm.

20:06.821 --> 20:09.733
Love me some Fran.

20:12.627 --> 20:13.604
Hey.

20:13.628 --> 20:14.872
- Hey.
- You going out?

20:14.896 --> 20:17.497
Yeah, trying a new restaurant
in Dupont Circle.

20:19.267 --> 20:21.048
Hey, man to man...

20:21.049 --> 20:22.927
is this...

20:22.951 --> 20:25.129
is the beanie too much?

20:25.153 --> 20:27.332
Is that what you call it?

20:27.356 --> 20:30.468
Going Socratic on me, so that's a yes.

20:30.492 --> 20:32.804
What restaurant?

20:32.828 --> 20:35.006
Some locavore thing.

20:35.030 --> 20:37.108
- Go ahead.
- What?

20:37.132 --> 20:38.343
I totally support locavore.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.811
Yeah, I'm really feeling the...

20:39.835 --> 20:42.380
- the warmth of non-judgment.
- Okay.

20:42.404 --> 20:44.716
Do you really need me to say it?

20:44.740 --> 20:46.417
You moved out
less than two weeks ago...

20:46.441 --> 20:47.652
isn't it a little early

20:47.676 --> 20:49.287
to be on a dating app?

20:49.311 --> 20:51.422
What, are you tracking me online?

20:51.446 --> 20:53.191
Stevie saw you on there.

20:53.215 --> 20:54.792
And other people could, too.

20:54.816 --> 20:57.262
I mean... Sophie could find out.

20:57.286 --> 20:58.630
How do you think
that would make her feel?

20:58.654 --> 21:01.432
- She'd feel like we're moving on.
- Because you've

21:01.456 --> 21:03.534
- mutually decided that's the next step.
- You know,

21:03.558 --> 21:06.104
I thought, with my sister out of town,

21:06.128 --> 21:08.973
that I might not feel so judged.

21:08.997 --> 21:10.708
It's not judgment, Will,
I'm just concerned.

21:10.732 --> 21:13.544
I mean, don't you
want to take a minute

21:13.568 --> 21:14.646
to figure yourself out?

21:14.670 --> 21:16.214
That's exactly what I'm doing.

21:16.238 --> 21:17.548
Really?

21:19.641 --> 21:22.820
You know, I asked for your opinion.

21:22.844 --> 21:24.812
So thank you.

21:28.216 --> 21:30.061
Well, she walks away from
the laptop, only the laptop

21:30.085 --> 21:31.763
is facing the map of the outbreak,

21:31.787 --> 21:34.232
- I screen-grab it, send it to WHO.
- That's great.

21:34.256 --> 21:35.466
- And then based on...
- Good morning.

21:35.490 --> 21:36.834
- Good morning.
- I get the latte?

21:36.858 --> 21:38.503
- Full service.
- You know what?

21:38.527 --> 21:40.104
That's for working a miracle.

21:40.128 --> 21:42.740
- Wow. Who says public service
doesn't pay? -

21:42.764 --> 21:45.810
So, anyway, um, so, based on
where the outbreak started...

21:45.834 --> 21:47.745
a beach town called El Nido...

21:47.769 --> 21:49.314
WHO was able to pinpoint
when it started:

21:49.338 --> 21:51.649
right after a tour group
of... wait for it...

21:51.673 --> 21:53.918
Australians left town.

21:53.942 --> 21:55.286
- Plot twist.
- Uh-huh.

21:55.310 --> 21:56.721
Wait, so Patient Zero
for the Philippines outbreak

21:56.745 --> 21:58.089
was an Australian citizen?

21:58.113 --> 21:59.390
A toddler, actually.

21:59.414 --> 22:01.259
A family on the tour group
hadn't vaccinated.

22:01.283 --> 22:03.194
Which means we have proof
that the migrants aren't,

22:03.218 --> 22:04.562
- aren't the source of the outbreak.
- Yes.

22:04.586 --> 22:05.930
When does the Australian
delegation leave?

22:05.954 --> 22:08.333
- Uh, like, now.
- Ah.

22:08.357 --> 22:11.602
Call AFDW. Ground the plane.

22:11.626 --> 22:13.871
The WHO still has work
to do, but clearly

22:13.895 --> 22:16.074
the outbreak didn't come from
the Solomon Islands migrants,

22:16.098 --> 22:18.643
which means we can get back
to the table on this deal.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.045
I'll need to follow up with my
Department of Health about this.

22:21.069 --> 22:23.214
But thank you.

22:23.238 --> 22:25.350
Mr. Prime Minister, I get it.

22:25.374 --> 22:27.585
The White House was attacked
over immigration reform.

22:27.609 --> 22:29.620
This isn't an easy
conversation for any of us.

22:29.644 --> 22:32.112
But the problem isn't going away.

22:33.915 --> 22:36.417
I want to help you.

22:37.886 --> 22:40.698
I also want to stay in office.

22:40.722 --> 22:42.700
I know you've got
anti-immigration hardliners

22:42.724 --> 22:44.535
calling for your head,

22:44.559 --> 22:47.605
but... is the job more important

22:47.629 --> 22:49.330
than standing up for what's right?

22:51.166 --> 22:52.944
I realize you're only
trying to channel

22:52.968 --> 22:55.046
what your superior might say,

22:55.070 --> 22:57.571
so I'll ask you
to pass this on to her.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.918
There are times when a leader

23:00.942 --> 23:02.320
must be willing to make decisions

23:02.344 --> 23:05.490
that are best for his people,

23:05.514 --> 23:08.782
even when that doesn't align
with his moral sensibilities.

23:10.652 --> 23:12.530
Like covering up a measles outbreak

23:12.554 --> 23:14.255
to protect your tourism industry?

23:16.525 --> 23:18.259
Due respect.

23:20.595 --> 23:22.673
Whether or not this outbreak
originated in my country

23:22.697 --> 23:24.442
is as yet unproven.

23:24.466 --> 23:26.644
What we have ample proof of

23:26.668 --> 23:29.147
is that your growing
unvaccinated population

23:29.171 --> 23:32.206
has put us all at risk
of a global pandemic.

23:33.175 --> 23:35.653
Before you counsel me

23:35.677 --> 23:38.623
on standing up for what's right,

23:38.647 --> 23:40.781
I suggest you look to your own house.

23:46.755 --> 23:48.699
Code blue, Pediatric Room 3.

23:48.723 --> 23:49.834
Code blue...

23:49.858 --> 23:51.035
What's happening? What's wrong?

23:51.059 --> 23:52.236
Ms. Grant.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.304
Her oxygen levels
have dropped below 80.

23:53.328 --> 23:54.439
Is she okay? What are you doing?

23:54.463 --> 23:55.440
She's in acute respiratory distress.

23:55.464 --> 23:57.341
We need to do an emergency intubation.

23:57.365 --> 23:59.610
- That's my baby girl.
- And we are going to do everything

23:59.634 --> 24:00.878
that we can.

24:07.142 --> 24:09.086
Stylet.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.811
Ready.

24:27.385 --> 24:30.420
Hey. How's she doing?

24:30.421 --> 24:33.400
Stable. For now.

24:33.424 --> 24:35.202
Good.

24:35.226 --> 24:37.971
I mean, none-none of this is good.

24:37.995 --> 24:39.439
You know what I'm saying.

24:39.463 --> 24:42.609
My mother had measles growing up.

24:42.633 --> 24:45.979
There's a picture of her
in her crib, covered in a rash.

24:46.003 --> 24:50.350
She was sick for a few days
and that was it.

24:50.374 --> 24:53.754
I knew it was a dangerous disease,

24:53.778 --> 24:56.923
that kids could die from it,

24:56.947 --> 24:58.959
but I also knew
that measles was eradicated

24:58.983 --> 25:01.228
in the U.S. back in 2000.

25:01.252 --> 25:03.430
And there were all these articles

25:03.454 --> 25:05.866
about possible harm from vaccines,

25:05.890 --> 25:07.868
and then a study saying
there was no proof.

25:07.892 --> 25:10.270
And then you read
another article and y-you...

25:10.294 --> 25:12.372
I mean, you don't know what to think.

25:12.396 --> 25:15.398
And we weren't the only ones.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.680
Lots of parents at Lyric's
preschool didn't vaccinate.

25:20.704 --> 25:23.517
You know, I-I thought she was strong.

25:23.541 --> 25:26.542
She could fight it like my mom did.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.881
And that I was protecting her.

25:33.717 --> 25:36.429
Now she has encephalitis.

25:36.453 --> 25:38.721
They're saying she could be blind.

25:40.891 --> 25:43.259
Or worse.

25:46.864 --> 25:48.241
I know you think I'm a fool.

25:48.265 --> 25:50.577
No, hey. Hey.

25:50.601 --> 25:52.535
We're gonna get our
girls through this.

26:03.781 --> 26:04.958
Look, I know it's hard.

26:04.982 --> 26:06.426
We're all worried about Joanna,

26:06.450 --> 26:09.796
but even Daisy would want us
to keep doing our jobs.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.231
We've got a roundtable to salvage,

26:11.255 --> 26:13.066
so where are we on that?

26:13.090 --> 26:14.601
Uh, I don't know
how salvageable it is.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.403
Three more countries pulled out.

26:16.427 --> 26:18.205
And U.N. High Commissioner
Rubiano thinks

26:18.229 --> 26:19.840
that we should try again
in a few years.

26:19.864 --> 26:22.542
By 2050, there's estimated to be

26:22.566 --> 26:25.612
a billion climate migrants worldwide.

26:25.636 --> 26:27.808
Not having a plan
for what to do with them...

26:27.809 --> 26:30.022
that, that-that makes
total sense, that's good.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.142
We have to get Australia
back on board.

26:31.143 --> 26:32.588
If Lawson gets
ousted, he'll most likely

26:32.612 --> 26:34.289
be replaced by an
anti-immigration hardliner.

26:34.313 --> 26:35.624
And then we're dead in the water.

26:35.648 --> 26:37.073
They are the country of origin

26:37.074 --> 26:38.485
for a massive global outbreak.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.220
We... W-We could...

26:40.244 --> 26:44.124
We could issue a State
Department travel warning

26:44.148 --> 26:45.893
against visiting Australia.

26:45.917 --> 26:48.262
You know what?

26:48.286 --> 26:50.664
It's peak surfing season...
a travel warning would threaten

26:50.665 --> 26:52.543
their entire tourism industry.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.645
And no one would blame him
for coming back.

26:54.669 --> 26:56.213
It's the right approach, but, uh,

26:56.237 --> 26:57.681
I don't want to get
into a finger-pointing match

26:57.705 --> 26:59.349
as to whose unvaccinated population

26:59.373 --> 27:00.784
is more to blame for the outbreak.

27:00.808 --> 27:02.319
Yeah. We don't have much
of a position there, do we?

27:02.343 --> 27:03.520
Well, no, hold on.

27:03.544 --> 27:04.988
We could take out the warning part,

27:05.012 --> 27:07.090
and just publicize
that the outbreak originated

27:07.114 --> 27:09.626
with an Australian citizen
and not the migrants.

27:09.650 --> 27:11.361
- Yeah. It'll piss 'em off...
- Well...

27:11.385 --> 27:13.096
but less than an official
travel warning.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.199
Might be enough
to get 'em back to D.C.

27:15.223 --> 27:16.833
Okay, do it.

27:16.857 --> 27:19.002
And, Kat, once the news breaks,
start making calls.

27:19.026 --> 27:21.238
Let's try to get every Pacific
leader back at the table.

27:21.262 --> 27:23.307
Excuse me. It's time for
the White House meeting.

27:23.331 --> 27:25.842
Start with Andrada in the Philippines.

27:28.603 --> 27:32.082
We're looking at 85 confirmed
cases so far, 37 in the U.S.

27:32.106 --> 27:33.951
Over the coming weeks,

27:33.975 --> 27:35.686
that number could rise
well into the hundreds.

27:35.710 --> 27:37.254
But thanks to the tip from State

27:37.278 --> 27:38.689
that led us to the point of origin,

27:38.713 --> 27:39.923
we're finally getting a handle

27:39.947 --> 27:41.158
on the global scope of the outbreak.

27:41.182 --> 27:42.993
That's good news.

27:43.017 --> 27:44.461
Yes, but no.

27:44.485 --> 27:46.930
Sir, as a nation, we have
high vaccination coverage.

27:46.954 --> 27:48.732
That's what saved us.

27:48.756 --> 27:50.567
But in five years,

27:50.591 --> 27:55.072
if the vaccinated population
continues to drop below 90%,

27:55.096 --> 27:56.607
like it already has

27:56.631 --> 28:01.111
in, uh, over a dozen small
communities in the U.S.,

28:01.135 --> 28:02.713
we'll lose our herd immunity.

28:02.737 --> 28:04.615
And then we'll be back

28:04.639 --> 28:06.883
to the full-blown pandemics
of a century ago.

28:06.907 --> 28:10.354
Sounds to me like someone's
pushing policy change.

28:10.378 --> 28:12.122
Well, no one is disputing
the need for a response.

28:12.146 --> 28:13.557
Just not a response

28:13.581 --> 28:14.891
that includes the word "mandatory."

28:14.915 --> 28:17.694
Which is why the question
becomes how to keep everyone safe

28:17.718 --> 28:19.029
without violating civil liberties.

28:19.053 --> 28:20.864
We legislated seat belts...

28:20.888 --> 28:22.399
how many lives did that save?

28:22.423 --> 28:23.834
Forcing every citizen

28:23.858 --> 28:25.769
to be injected with a substance
they might not want

28:25.793 --> 28:28.472
is a lot more complicated
than buckling a seat belt.

28:28.496 --> 28:31.375
If it were up to me,
immunization would be mandatory.

28:31.399 --> 28:34.645
Unless you had some documented
medical exception.

28:34.669 --> 28:38.048
But politics I-is the art
of the possible.

28:38.072 --> 28:40.183
We're wading into much
deeper waters here.

28:40.207 --> 28:42.286
States' rights alone
would kill it in committee.

28:42.310 --> 28:43.687
People forget what it was like

28:43.711 --> 28:45.656
to pray your child wasn't paralyzed,

28:45.680 --> 28:48.091
disfigured, or dead
by their fifth birthday.

28:48.115 --> 28:50.627
Okay.

28:50.651 --> 28:52.195
So what can we do?

28:52.219 --> 28:53.430
The research shows

28:53.454 --> 28:55.065
that most parents
opt out of immunizing

28:55.089 --> 28:56.333
for a couple of reasons.

28:56.357 --> 28:57.668
Misinformation being the biggest.

28:57.692 --> 29:00.003
Well, that's the thing
about democracy.

29:00.027 --> 29:01.405
People are free to consume

29:01.429 --> 29:03.507
as much misinformation as they want.

29:03.531 --> 29:04.875
Access is another problem,

29:04.899 --> 29:08.178
especially for the uninsured
and the underinsured.

29:08.202 --> 29:10.080
Some states have
free vaccination programs.

29:10.104 --> 29:12.215
In others, non-profits slip in.

29:12.239 --> 29:14.051
Not all states
have options for everyone.

29:14.075 --> 29:15.585
Considering how important this is

29:15.609 --> 29:19.556
for public health and
national security even,

29:19.580 --> 29:21.692
shouldn't vaccines be
something that's free for all?

29:21.716 --> 29:23.694
Maybe we could
implement a federal program

29:23.718 --> 29:27.097
to provide money and tax credits
to non-profits

29:27.121 --> 29:29.466
and other health providers
for free vaccinations.

29:29.490 --> 29:31.435
And you think that this would
help increase vaccination rates?

29:31.459 --> 29:32.569
Yes.

29:32.593 --> 29:34.705
Federal funding
could definitely expand

29:34.729 --> 29:37.274
the pool of vaccinated people
in this country.

29:37.298 --> 29:39.376
Well, this needs
to be passed by Congress,

29:39.400 --> 29:41.478
so let's dig into these options

29:41.502 --> 29:43.447
and start putting together
some, uh, proposals, huh?

29:43.471 --> 29:46.016
If you were looking for a more
immediate plan, this ain't it.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.384
It'll make a difference.

29:47.408 --> 29:49.152
It's just too bad
that it will do nothing

29:49.176 --> 29:51.088
to combat the spread
of misinformation.

29:51.112 --> 29:53.423
Because the biggest problem

29:53.447 --> 29:56.326
is our public's eroding faith
in science and our institutions.

29:56.350 --> 29:57.794
That's what scares me the most.

29:57.818 --> 29:59.763
Well, let's keep looking
at how to address that, hmm?

29:59.787 --> 30:01.264
Thank you, everyone.

30:05.593 --> 30:07.404
Hey.

30:07.428 --> 30:09.005
- Hey.
- How's it going?

30:09.029 --> 30:11.007
Good.

30:11.031 --> 30:14.111
I'm starving.
Is there anything to eat?

30:14.135 --> 30:15.946
Rice and vegetables,
I think, in the fridge.

30:15.970 --> 30:17.814
Great. Thanks.

30:17.838 --> 30:21.241
So, um, you...

30:22.309 --> 30:25.856
You didn't eat, uh, where you were?

30:25.880 --> 30:28.625
For a family of spies,

30:28.649 --> 30:31.027
you people are terrible at
prying into my private life.

30:31.051 --> 30:32.028
I'm sorry.

30:32.052 --> 30:34.231
You did kind of put it out there

30:34.255 --> 30:35.932
when you posted a profile

30:35.956 --> 30:38.525
on, uh, the dating app that I'm on.

30:41.028 --> 30:42.906
Can we also talk
about how your age range

30:42.930 --> 30:44.775
goes down to 23?

30:44.799 --> 30:48.645
Yeah, I had a date, and I cut it short

30:48.669 --> 30:52.115
to go home, check on my daughter.

30:52.139 --> 30:54.384
Oh, is she okay?

30:54.408 --> 30:55.652
Yeah, yeah, sh-she's fine.

30:55.676 --> 30:58.922
Just a little fever,
but with all the measles stuff,

30:58.946 --> 31:01.825
- Sophie just wanted to be sure.
- Yeah.

31:01.849 --> 31:05.629
I'm glad that she has you
to reach out to.

31:05.653 --> 31:07.998
- I'm sorry...
- Yeah.

31:08.022 --> 31:10.967
About your date being cut short.

31:10.991 --> 31:15.071
Well, it turns out dating
is as horrible as I remember it.

31:20.501 --> 31:22.212
This must be the party room.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.590
You try coming up with a way
to get through to parents

31:23.614 --> 31:24.825
who refuse to vaccinate their kids,

31:24.849 --> 31:26.660
and see if you don't party this hard.

31:26.684 --> 31:28.590
I struck out on getting anyone
to come back to the table

31:28.591 --> 31:29.996
for the Climate Migration Agreement.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.465
Not one country?

31:31.489 --> 31:33.600
Even after the news

31:33.624 --> 31:36.303
that the outbreak started
in Australia?

31:36.327 --> 31:37.838
Can't shake the original news
linking the outbreak

31:37.862 --> 31:39.539
to the migrants.

31:39.563 --> 31:41.074
I guess people want to see
the face of disease

31:41.098 --> 31:42.209
as a desperate refugee

31:42.233 --> 31:45.245
rather than a privileged
Australian tourist.

31:45.269 --> 31:46.880
That is so not helping my headache.

31:46.904 --> 31:49.082
Well, neither will this.

31:49.106 --> 31:50.684
Australia is sending

31:50.708 --> 31:52.385
all of their current climate migrants

31:52.409 --> 31:53.854
back to their home islands.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.479
I'm so sorry, Jay.

32:02.257 --> 32:03.957
Hey.

32:07.522 --> 32:09.957
Hey. What are you doing here?

32:09.958 --> 32:12.670
Making sure you two aren't
eating out of a vending machine.

32:12.694 --> 32:13.804
Hi, Verline.

32:13.828 --> 32:14.939
Matthew.

32:14.963 --> 32:18.709
Just when I think
I made up my mind about you.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.044
It's good to see you.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.779
Ah.

32:21.803 --> 32:23.837
Got it, honey. Okay.

32:26.608 --> 32:30.577
I'll set this up in the dining room.

32:31.813 --> 32:33.847
Oh, gosh.

32:34.916 --> 32:36.894
She still calls me Matthew.

32:36.918 --> 32:38.696
She calls you other things, too.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.731
- How's Waffles?
- He's great.

32:40.755 --> 32:42.199
He's with my landlord right now.

32:42.223 --> 32:44.235
But, man, is he ready to see you.

32:44.259 --> 32:45.970
Waffles, not my landlord.

32:45.994 --> 32:47.204
God.

32:47.228 --> 32:49.673
Which might be, uh,
pretty-pretty soon, right?

32:49.697 --> 32:52.009
They took her off
the ventilator an hour ago.

32:52.033 --> 32:53.811
Her antibody levels were low,

32:53.835 --> 32:56.280
but she had enough
to slow down the virus

32:56.304 --> 32:57.948
until she could fight it off.

32:57.972 --> 33:00.084
Thank God she was vaccinated.

33:01.376 --> 33:03.020
That couple I met on the cruise,

33:03.044 --> 33:05.523
they didn't give their
daughter the MMR shot.

33:05.547 --> 33:09.226
I mean, the mother's just
killing herself with guilt.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.685
You think she might want
to do something about it?

33:17.292 --> 33:18.802
I think I have something.

33:18.826 --> 33:21.672
Okay, every country, with
the exception of New Zealand,

33:21.696 --> 33:23.474
pulled out of talks because of the lie

33:23.498 --> 33:24.808
that migrants have the measles.

33:24.832 --> 33:25.843
- Right.
- Which is a virus

33:25.867 --> 33:26.944
that's only spreading

33:26.968 --> 33:28.212
because of kids who weren't vaccinated

33:28.236 --> 33:29.480
because of this other lie,

33:29.504 --> 33:31.482
that the MMR causes autism.

33:31.506 --> 33:33.509
- You see what our problem is here?
- Yeah.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.852
We're being deal-blocked
by two movements

33:34.876 --> 33:36.987
that feed off fear and suspicion
to the detriment of society.

33:37.011 --> 33:39.323
Right, and I think if
we can take care of one,

33:39.347 --> 33:40.457
we can work around the other.

33:40.481 --> 33:42.459
Yeah, but how do we address
vaccine skeptics?

33:42.483 --> 33:44.328
POTUS is working on some
policy initiatives,

33:44.352 --> 33:46.397
which will take time
and may or may not be effective.

33:46.421 --> 33:47.865
But then it hit me this morning:

33:47.889 --> 33:49.466
we're the State Department.

33:49.490 --> 33:50.801
We are.

33:50.825 --> 33:52.536
We control passports.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.872
And if you want one
or you want to renew one,

33:54.896 --> 33:57.731
you're gonna have to show proof
of vaccination.

33:59.767 --> 34:02.379
Too crazy?

34:02.403 --> 34:05.416
Proof of immunization
to get a passport?

34:05.440 --> 34:06.817
You can't just do that.

34:06.841 --> 34:09.386
Well, we explored the plan with
the Office of the Legal Adviser,

34:09.409 --> 34:10.920
and we can do that.

34:10.945 --> 34:12.456
With the president's approval,
of course.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.791
Did you not hear the part

34:13.815 --> 34:15.225
about encroaching on civil liberties?

34:15.248 --> 34:17.226
We already require immigrants

34:17.251 --> 34:19.295
to show proof of vaccination
when they enter the country.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.764
If U.S. citizens don't want
to get vaccinated,

34:21.789 --> 34:23.300
they're perfectly free to not

34:23.324 --> 34:25.402
- leave the country.
- Okay, well, we would still offer

34:25.426 --> 34:28.172
exemptions for medical.
But if they opt out

34:28.196 --> 34:30.507
for religious
or philosophical reasons,

34:30.531 --> 34:32.409
they would just have to be backed up

34:32.433 --> 34:33.543
with in-person consultations.

34:33.568 --> 34:35.145
We're all familiar
with weaponizing bureaucracy.

34:35.168 --> 34:37.648
It's straight out of
the voter suppression playbook.

34:37.672 --> 34:40.951
Yes, but, Russell, if
this bureaucracy is deployed

34:40.975 --> 34:43.853
for the greater good,
if this is about protecting us

34:43.878 --> 34:46.991
from the risk
of potentially fatal diseases,

34:47.014 --> 34:49.360
then it could, arguably, fall

34:49.384 --> 34:51.295
under the responsibility
of the federal government

34:51.319 --> 34:52.696
to provide for the common defense.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.197
The Constitution's on our side.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.632
And-and, Russell,

34:55.657 --> 34:57.434
honestly, this is a measured step.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.436
France recently made
vaccinations mandatory

34:59.460 --> 35:01.505
for all citizens,
in response to their increases

35:01.529 --> 35:03.774
- in measle cases.
- The CDC has been trying

35:03.798 --> 35:06.110
to address vaccine
hesitancy for decades.

35:06.134 --> 35:07.378
Right, and as we know,

35:07.402 --> 35:09.313
all it takes is
one unsubstantiated study,

35:09.337 --> 35:11.849
one misconstrued rumor that gets

35:11.873 --> 35:13.183
signal-boosted online...

35:13.207 --> 35:14.852
Well, encroaching on the freedom

35:14.876 --> 35:17.121
of people who take their family
on a European vacation

35:17.145 --> 35:18.622
doesn't solve that.

35:18.646 --> 35:19.957
But it does.

35:19.981 --> 35:22.526
Partly. The best way

35:22.550 --> 35:25.396
to fight lies and misinformation

35:25.420 --> 35:27.665
is with fact, truth, and science.

35:27.689 --> 35:30.401
A mandatory consultation would
give people the opportunity

35:30.425 --> 35:33.070
to ask questions,
to alleviate any concerns.

35:33.094 --> 35:34.371
That sounds like it respects

35:34.395 --> 35:35.372
our civil liberties,

35:35.396 --> 35:37.174
and it gets to the heart
of the problem:

35:37.198 --> 35:39.176
there's no more powerful force
on Earth

35:39.200 --> 35:42.346
than a parent's determination
to protect their children.

35:42.370 --> 35:45.516
So if someone can listen
to their concerns,

35:45.540 --> 35:46.850
with respect...

35:46.874 --> 35:48.218
Really?

35:48.242 --> 35:49.887
'Cause even in the face
of unequivocal evidence,

35:49.911 --> 35:51.355
people still deny global warming.

35:51.379 --> 35:53.490
H-How is vaccine denial any different?

35:53.514 --> 35:55.059
It's not.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.127
Education is a start,
but it is not enough.

35:57.151 --> 35:58.896
Which is why I support

35:58.920 --> 36:01.865
Mr. Whitman's proposal.

36:01.889 --> 36:04.034
In states and countries
where they've made it harder

36:04.058 --> 36:06.937
for parents to opt out,
vaccination rates went up.

36:06.961 --> 36:09.273
- It's a bold move.
- Yeah.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.942
Piss off people on both
sides of the aisle.

36:11.966 --> 36:15.846
Fire up advocacy groups.
Unleash a slew of lawsuits.

36:15.870 --> 36:18.782
If we can't address everyone's
fears with reason, then...

36:18.806 --> 36:20.884
maybe we need a...

36:20.908 --> 36:23.754
little bureaucratic nudge, too.

36:23.778 --> 36:25.589
Let's get into it.

36:25.613 --> 36:27.948
Thank you, sir.

36:29.550 --> 36:31.962
Get out. Get... out.

36:31.986 --> 36:34.565
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:34.589 --> 36:35.566
You have fun with Daddy?

36:35.590 --> 36:36.567
- Yep.
- I beat him at chess.

36:36.591 --> 36:38.635
- I let her win.
- No, you didn't.

36:38.659 --> 36:40.370
- Yes, I did.
- Bye, Dad.

36:40.394 --> 36:42.639
Bye, sweetie.

36:42.663 --> 36:45.542
No, I-I didn't. She destroyed me.

36:45.566 --> 36:47.511
- Yeah, she's really good.
- She is.

36:47.535 --> 36:49.446
Um, thanks for coming last night.

36:49.470 --> 36:51.982
I'm sorry, I don't know why
I let myself get so spun out.

36:52.006 --> 36:54.051
No.

36:54.075 --> 36:57.087
It's a good thing
you're married to a doctor.

36:57.111 --> 37:00.591
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

37:00.615 --> 37:04.094
Hey, I-I've been thinking.

37:04.118 --> 37:09.066
It might be better if we tried
to work things out at home.

37:09.090 --> 37:11.235
We talked about this.

37:11.259 --> 37:13.203
I know.

37:13.227 --> 37:16.206
But yesterday was good.

37:16.230 --> 37:18.408
Yeah, of course it was good,
because I needed you,

37:18.432 --> 37:21.578
and you like feeling needed.

37:21.602 --> 37:23.580
But that doesn't change
the rest of our problems.

37:23.604 --> 37:25.949
I moved here so we could be a family.

37:25.973 --> 37:27.351
And yet you spend more
time at the hospital

37:27.375 --> 37:28.619
than you do at home.

37:28.643 --> 37:30.821
And when you are home,
your mind is someplace else.

37:30.845 --> 37:33.991
I love you, but you're not
built for slogging through

37:34.015 --> 37:36.693
the everyday boring
parts of family life.

37:36.717 --> 37:39.586
And I need someone who is.

37:45.493 --> 37:48.005
Our decision to return the
Solomon Islanders to their home

37:48.029 --> 37:49.239
was ours to make,

37:49.263 --> 37:52.176
based on our nation's
immigration regulations.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.679
And it is exactly this kind
of moral lecturing

37:55.703 --> 37:57.347
from the United States
that has stalled your attempt

37:57.371 --> 37:58.682
to enforce climate migration

37:58.706 --> 38:00.484
from the safety of another hemisphere.

38:00.508 --> 38:02.686
With respect, Mr. Prime Minister,

38:02.710 --> 38:05.455
you stalled the talks
by pulling out of them.

38:05.479 --> 38:07.391
I'd like you to help me
get them back on track.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.026
That's simply not possible
at this time.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.027
My hands are tied.

38:10.051 --> 38:11.528
Are they, though?

38:11.552 --> 38:12.796
Excuse me?

38:12.820 --> 38:15.465
Sorry, but you seem pretty deft
at blaming migrants

38:15.489 --> 38:17.467
for an outbreak that began
with your own citizen.

38:17.491 --> 38:19.970
And it seems to me that
your own unvaccinated citizens

38:19.994 --> 38:22.706
played a key part in the spread
of this outbreak.

38:22.730 --> 38:25.075
Which is why President Dalton
is exploring policy changes

38:25.099 --> 38:26.343
to address the issue.

38:26.367 --> 38:28.612
Oh, is this what your boss
would call diplomacy?

38:28.636 --> 38:31.682
Diplomacy was when Secretary McCord

38:31.706 --> 38:34.184
and the UNHCR set up talks
for an inevitable

38:34.208 --> 38:36.320
humanitarian crisis.

38:36.344 --> 38:38.922
Your political enemies are
holding those talks hostage

38:38.946 --> 38:41.124
to their own extreme
anti-immigrant agenda.

38:41.148 --> 38:42.593
So, why don't you tell them this:

38:42.617 --> 38:45.963
the talks resume,
or the U.S. will be forced

38:45.987 --> 38:48.899
to issue a travel alert
requiring proof of vaccination

38:48.923 --> 38:50.667
for travel between our two countries.

38:50.691 --> 38:53.570
Are you really prepared
to alienate a key ally

38:53.594 --> 38:55.205
while you're filling in for your boss?

38:55.229 --> 38:58.609
I'm confident the secretary
understands both of our

38:58.633 --> 39:01.745
great nations' responsibility
to a changing world.

39:01.769 --> 39:03.870
Hope to see you back
at the roundtable.

39:07.291 --> 39:10.035
- And you'll get to see Waffles.
- Yay.

39:10.036 --> 39:12.332
And we'll get to go see
the monkeys at the zoo.

39:12.356 --> 39:13.766
- Ooh.
- And maybe go to the park.

39:13.790 --> 39:15.802
- Hey.
- What does a monkey say?

39:15.826 --> 39:18.671
What does a monkey say?

39:18.695 --> 39:20.006
And guess what Grandma got for you.

39:20.030 --> 39:22.775
- Bun-Bun!
- Yay.

39:22.799 --> 39:25.011
Bun-Bun.

39:25.035 --> 39:26.245
He's so cute.

39:26.269 --> 39:29.182
I, uh, I just wanted
to thank you and Matt

39:29.206 --> 39:31.351
for setting up this interview.

39:31.375 --> 39:34.354
Are you sure you're up for it?

39:34.378 --> 39:36.623
I want to get the message out.

39:36.647 --> 39:38.625
How's Lyric?

39:38.649 --> 39:40.593
Not awake yet.

39:40.617 --> 39:43.096
Um, they're saying she's probably

39:43.120 --> 39:45.632
cognitively impaired by the swelling.

39:45.656 --> 39:48.534
I'm so sorry.

39:48.558 --> 39:50.770
I always thought I'd be
on Good Day D.C.

39:50.794 --> 39:52.372
for my butterscotch brownies,
you know.

39:54.998 --> 39:57.443
Any last-minute advice?

39:57.467 --> 40:00.947
Ignore the camera and
just have a conversation.

40:00.971 --> 40:03.516
You're gonna do great.

40:03.540 --> 40:05.708
Okay.

40:08.912 --> 40:10.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:10.681 --> 40:11.891
That's... I got your text.

40:11.915 --> 40:13.326
- That's so great you're moving back.
- Yeah.

40:13.350 --> 40:15.294
- Not that I'm happy to see you go.
- Well, no. No, no.

40:15.318 --> 40:17.130
I'm not exactly moving back just yet.

40:17.154 --> 40:19.832
I did find an apartment
a little bit closer to home

40:19.856 --> 40:22.135
so that I can be there
for the boring stuff.

40:22.159 --> 40:24.070
'Cause I-I want to show myself

40:24.094 --> 40:25.921
that I can be there
for the boring stuff.

40:26.944 --> 40:29.208
Might want to start
by not referring to it

40:29.232 --> 40:31.367
as "the boring stuff."

40:32.602 --> 40:33.702
Thanks.

40:35.405 --> 40:36.983
I know many of you are hesitant

40:37.007 --> 40:39.052
to sign a deal agreeing to accept

40:39.076 --> 40:42.488
even more migrants
than you already have.

40:42.512 --> 40:44.857
But it must be emphasized

40:44.881 --> 40:47.260
this agreement is in no way

40:47.284 --> 40:49.896
a call for open borders.

40:49.920 --> 40:54.100
This is just a way for us
to come together

40:54.124 --> 40:58.304
to acknowledge
that no one stands alone

40:58.328 --> 40:59.772
in a changing world.

40:59.796 --> 41:03.209
There is still great good
that we can do together,

41:03.233 --> 41:06.245
especially when the waters are rising,

41:06.269 --> 41:10.016
and the very idea of home

41:10.040 --> 41:11.918
is shifting beneath our feet.

41:11.942 --> 41:14.710
Oh, it is good to be back.

41:16.513 --> 41:18.291
I mean, don't get me wrong.

41:18.315 --> 41:20.293
The walks in the woods,

41:20.317 --> 41:24.864
the draft of my speech
that I got done...

41:24.888 --> 41:25.898
it was pretty great.

41:25.922 --> 41:27.967
How about the private chef?

41:27.991 --> 41:32.505
Oh, well, I prefer reheated pasta

41:32.529 --> 41:34.941
in the kitchen with you.

41:34.965 --> 41:36.275
But it was pretty great.

41:36.299 --> 41:38.611
Yeah.

41:38.635 --> 41:40.970
Hey, you said you'd wait till morning.

41:45.475 --> 41:47.053
Well, tell me one thing that happened

41:47.077 --> 41:49.355
while I was away.

41:49.379 --> 41:51.257
Well, your brother moved out
to be closer to home.

41:51.281 --> 41:53.626
- Shut the front door!
- You want to know why?

41:53.650 --> 41:56.362
I...

41:56.386 --> 41:58.898
Something about that story
is gonna drive me crazy,

41:58.922 --> 42:01.367
so let's just table it
with the news of the world.

42:03.460 --> 42:06.105
I'm glad you're back.

42:06.129 --> 42:07.229
Me, too.

42:15.839 --> 42:17.350
Okay.

42:17.374 --> 42:19.352
Officer Gleeson will be right in

42:19.376 --> 42:22.155
to help finalize your papers.

42:22.179 --> 42:25.147
Welcome to Australia.
