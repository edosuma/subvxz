WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.436
- <i>Previously on</i> the strain.
- 206 passengers are dead

00:04.438 --> 00:06.372
And we don't know why.
Four passengers survived

00:06.374 --> 00:08.774
And we don't know why.
- Seal off the perimeter

00:08.776 --> 00:11.443
Of the airport.
- Got it.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.445
- I said let him through.
I made a deal with greg

00:13.447 --> 00:16.181
To provide some information
and let a piece of medical cargo

00:16.183 --> 00:18.617
Through customs. That's it.
- Here is the rest of the money

00:18.619 --> 00:21.220
Greg promised you in return.
- Tell him that one of

00:21.222 --> 00:23.222
The survivors is very sick. Tell
him we need to corral the rest

00:23.224 --> 00:25.691
Of the survivors and anybody
they've had contact with. Now!

00:25.693 --> 00:28.460
- Do you have a complete
passenger manifest with you?

00:28.462 --> 00:30.896
- Not right here. Why?
- Because you need to find

00:30.898 --> 00:33.632
Every last passenger
and destroy the bodies

00:33.634 --> 00:36.168
And anyone in contact with them.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.637
- This is gary arnot.
Thank you for sending

00:38.639 --> 00:40.639
My little girl home to me.
- Are you saying someone

00:40.641 --> 00:43.475
Released her body to you?
- No, not her body..

00:43.477 --> 00:45.711
Emma's alive. She showed up
on my doorstep this morning.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.080
(screaming)

00:48.082 --> 00:49.882
- We need to get him
into surgery, find out what's

00:49.884 --> 00:52.151
Happening inside him right now.
- Your patient-- he's gone.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.087
- Ok I found him.
- Doyle, what are you doing?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.456
- Get away from me. Agh!

01:10.870 --> 01:13.572
- Oh my god.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.276
- What just happened here?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.278
- You didn't have a choice.
- Did you hear him say my name?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.880
- What? No.
- He didn't say anything.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.882
Wish he had.
- The old man said

01:23.884 --> 01:26.218
Destroy the head
and burn the body.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.287
Should we be doing that?
- What are you saying?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.522
Are we burning corpses, now?

01:30.524 --> 01:33.192
- Ok, we have to cut him open
before the whole hospital

01:33.194 --> 01:35.227
Gets down here.
- Cut him open?

01:35.229 --> 01:37.529
We're all going to get arrested.
- It was self-defence.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.032
No one's getting arrested.
- L-- let's move him.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.367
We have to find
a place to do this.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.374
- We gotta call this in.
This is way over our heads.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.577
- I just killed this thing,
I need to explain

01:51.579 --> 01:55.314
Why I did that, jim.
- I'll go find a room.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.286
- Help me move him.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.622
- Well I just want to go
on record - I do not think

02:03.624 --> 02:05.457
That this is a good idea.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.127
- A monster just tried
to murder us.

02:08.129 --> 02:11.630
There are no records.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.634
(theme music)

02:28.581 --> 02:32.117
- Ok, we need a surgical kit,
specimen jars, and rubber bands

02:32.119 --> 02:34.119
To seal the gloves.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.121
Jim, stay with the body.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.157
- What if it gets up?
- Run.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.859
- Funny.
- You run.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.864
- But it's not
gonna get up, right?

02:53.373 --> 02:56.475
- Do you think redfern knew
what was happening to him?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.844
- I hope not.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.316
Hey, if you need time,
I can do this on my own.

03:04.318 --> 03:08.720
- No. I want to be there.
Find some answers.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.889
Make his death mean something.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.625
- Good, 'cause I need you.

03:18.965 --> 03:22.067
- Ansel?

03:22.069 --> 03:24.803
I'm taking the kids
to your sister's.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.472
Unless... You think I shouldn't.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.977
- No. Take them.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.214
Get them out of here
as soon as you can.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.653
Daddy's not feeling well.
Just go with mommy, ok?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.022
(gertie whimpering)

03:44.024 --> 03:46.258
- Please, let me call
dr. Barrett.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.060
He knows our family,

03:48.062 --> 03:52.397
He's not like these government
people - he cares about you.

03:52.399 --> 03:56.235
- No. I'm going to rest.
I'll be fine.

04:00.506 --> 04:03.909
- Go and wait by the door,
please. Go on.

04:13.219 --> 04:16.622
Is there anything
I can do for you?

04:16.624 --> 04:20.192
- No, annie. Just take care
of the kids, ok?

04:20.194 --> 04:23.295
Tell them I'm sorry
for being so grumpy, eh?

04:25.798 --> 04:28.300
- I'll put gertie in the shed,
get her out of your way.

04:28.302 --> 04:32.371
- No. No, leave her.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.274
She can keep me company.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.143
- Cuz, where's my clock?
- Shut up.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.546
- <i>Ha! Ha! Gusto! What up?</i>

05:47.548 --> 05:49.948
<i>Buenos dÃ­as.</i>
<i>- What up, bro?</i>

05:49.950 --> 05:52.784
- Smells good in here, man.
- I got to fatten you up, <i>ese.</i>

05:52.786 --> 05:55.287
- I'm hungry.
- Chupo's got you all manorexic.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.789
He! He! He!
- Everybody can't be pretty

05:57.791 --> 06:00.292
Like you, brah.
- That's just the start though.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.627
- Yeah?
- I hear good things.

06:02.629 --> 06:06.798
- Thank you, man.
- Cash flow things.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.334
- Keep it down, bro.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.570
- There's this dude in queens,
alonso creem.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.339
- Mmhm.
- He buys cars.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.974
Hear he pays up to a g a pop.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.911
Him and these nigerians.
This is a sure thing, homie.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.748
- For real?
- Yeah.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.450
- 'cause a sure thing got me
locked up last time.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.656
<i>Ya lleguÃ©, muchachos.</i>
<i>-Hola, mami!</i>

06:31.658 --> 06:35.594
<i>- Ya lleguÃ©. Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡n?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Bien. Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s?</i>

06:35.596 --> 06:38.330
- <i>Ah, pero mira quien</i>
<i>estÃ¡ aqui!</i>

06:38.332 --> 06:40.499
- <i>Buenos dÃ­as.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Buenos dÃ­as, mi pocholo.</i>

06:40.501 --> 06:42.534
<i>Â¿cÃ³mos estÃ¡s?</i>
<i>- Muy bien. Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡?</i>

06:42.536 --> 06:44.603
- I got the sweet rolls
you like.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.338
I stopped off at the bakery.
- Thank you.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.607
- You know how
I love this <i>niÃ±o.</i>

06:48.609 --> 06:50.342
- Uh huh.

06:50.344 --> 06:55.080
- Everyday he call me
or came while you were away.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.016
- I know.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.918
Andele.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.522
He bring me groceries. Yeah.
- Stolen from my pop's shop.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.957
- Don't joke.
- I'm not joking.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.760
- No, no, no. Too much.
I have to watch my weight.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.564
- <i>Mama, estÃ¡ hermosa.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Â¿quÃ© hermosa?</i>

07:12.566 --> 07:15.434
<i>Haber mi hijo. Â¿no quieres?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>No.</i>

07:20.807 --> 07:23.408
- Thank you, mama.
- <i>De nada, mi hijo.</i>

07:23.410 --> 07:27.145
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.463
- Ah. Herr eichorst.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.898
- Herr palmer.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.568
- Mr. Fitzwilliam, now that
mr. Eichorst is here,

07:49.570 --> 07:52.904
Will you show in our guest?

07:55.107 --> 07:57.843
- So.

07:57.845 --> 08:02.247
Dutch velders. A self-described
internet freedom fighter.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.983
Claims he can do all we need.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.486
Eccentric, but comes
highly recommended.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.526
- Dutch velders, mr. Palmer.

08:14.528 --> 08:18.763
- Hello, miss velders.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.632
Sorry, nobody said
you were a woman.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.602
- I get that a lot.
- After the regis air

08:23.604 --> 08:26.605
Catastrophe, the stock
markets plummeted.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.140
Then, as we all know,

08:29.142 --> 08:33.044
The ceo of regis air
killed himself.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.815
- Now, the online community is
up in arms about corporate greed

08:36.817 --> 08:40.485
And corruption - all those
people on that plane dying,

08:40.487 --> 08:44.523
The stock market crash -
and the possibility

08:44.525 --> 08:47.726
Of the suspension
of the nation's air travel...

08:48.895 --> 08:53.899
The online group, citizens
for liberty, is planning

08:53.901 --> 08:56.468
A massive hacking campaign
to crash the websites

08:56.470 --> 09:00.639
Of new york city's largest
corporations.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.475
Is that believable,
ms. Velders?

09:03.477 --> 09:06.545
- Heh! Anything's possible

09:06.547 --> 09:09.047
If it's motivated by enough
hatred, mr. Palmer.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.485
But it's gotta be someone
really smart,

09:13.487 --> 09:15.687
To figure out how
to drown servers.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.923
Takes time and patience.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.660
But the story is - the group
came to me.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.762
I'm the only one who could slow
the internet down

09:23.764 --> 09:26.765
To worse than dial-up. If
there is someone else that can,

09:26.767 --> 09:30.101
I taught them.
- She wants credit for it.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.204
- And, I also want money.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.541
- Must be so slow that sending
photos or instant anything

09:36.543 --> 09:39.778
Is impossible.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.013
- Sure.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.983
- It's much harder to hide evil
shit these days, isn't it?

09:50.590 --> 09:54.092
Are we doing this?
- Yes, you're hired.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.861
Thank you for coming in.

09:59.231 --> 10:02.067
- Jim, record video.
Use my phone, but be careful.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.069
Don't get near the blood.
- There's not a chance

10:04.071 --> 10:07.405
Of that happening.
- What happened to the worms?

10:07.407 --> 10:10.308
- I don't know but look at this.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.645
These folds, they seem
functional.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.715
- Vestibular folds.
If the body temperature rose

10:16.717 --> 10:19.951
A lot of heat would
be released through there.

10:30.930 --> 10:35.300
- His uh, genitals are... Gone.

10:35.302 --> 10:40.071
Uh, his excreting organs
have fused into a cloaca.

10:40.073 --> 10:44.075
- Do I even want to know?
- Uh, reptiles, birds

10:44.077 --> 10:48.747
Other lower animals... Their
urine and feces are all expelled

10:48.749 --> 10:51.983
Through the same opening.
- Oh, that's adorable.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.753
- It's efficient.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.255
Let's open him up.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.017
Jim, get closer. Film this.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.221
Lungs have dried up.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.501
Label that.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.872
- Label it as what?

11:50.743 --> 11:54.679
- Uh, the... Heart is all
shriveled up.

11:54.681 --> 11:58.149
The arteries are necrotic but...

11:58.151 --> 12:02.053
These tubular structures
appear healthy.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.824
It's a new circulatory system.

12:05.826 --> 12:09.861
- It's... Brand-new flesh,

12:09.863 --> 12:15.400
But it's symmetrical.
It's not random or cancerous.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.170
This is a plaque cartilage.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.706
A whole new set of organs

12:21.708 --> 12:25.343
Has generated to propel
this stinger.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.812
- Ugh - is that the technical
term for it, is it? Stinger?

12:30.683 --> 12:34.319
I feel like I'm choking
just looking at it.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.095
- Oh god.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.142
- Christ! What is that smell?

12:58.944 --> 13:02.213
- Ammonia discharge. Like guano.
- Same as on the plane.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.482
- And bishop's body.
- That's enough.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.285
(panting)
this is disgusting.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.955
Just-- just call it in, eph,
goddamit, just call it in!

13:10.957 --> 13:12.957
- Jim--
- no, this thing just shot

13:12.959 --> 13:15.727
A six foot python out
of its mouth, its dick is gone

13:15.729 --> 13:18.396
And it-- it just squirted
a shitload of shit

13:18.398 --> 13:21.933
All over the table and you've
got your hands everywhere.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.002
I mean, god. What the hell
is going on?!

13:24.004 --> 13:26.104
- It's a parasitic mechanism.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.773
This is rewriting human biology.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.976
- Why? Why is it doing that?
- So it can reproduce.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.046
And consume its host.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.298
- Hi mr. Farrell.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.767
- I'm gettin' a little tired
comin' up here, gadaloop.

13:55.769 --> 13:59.304
- I'm sorry.
- You always sorry,

13:59.306 --> 14:02.140
But nothin' changes.
How many times do I have

14:02.142 --> 14:04.375
To tell you - don't leave
recyclin' in the hallway.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.278
It's a fire hazard.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.848
Gus. Hey, there. Didn't know
you were back in town.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.883
- I thought we were
squared up this month.

14:11.885 --> 14:15.086
- No. Didn't get it...

14:22.995 --> 14:26.030
- Did you take the rent down?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.233
- Yes.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.235
I swear.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.804
- 'scuse me, mama. Please.
- Ok.

14:32.806 --> 14:35.006
- If I don't deliver
rent checks on time,

14:35.008 --> 14:37.242
The owner beats my balls off.
Everybody works for somebody,

14:37.244 --> 14:39.244
Right or wrong--
- we're not talking about

14:39.246 --> 14:41.713
The rent, now. Now we're
talking about the way

14:41.715 --> 14:44.816
You speak to my mother.
Yeah, that's funny, huh?

14:44.818 --> 14:46.851
'cause if she ever

14:46.853 --> 14:49.721
Tells me you talk to her
like that again

14:49.723 --> 14:52.490
They're going to find your body

14:52.492 --> 14:54.926
In one of those recycling bins
you love so much.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.363
Now here's the rent.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.398
And for next month.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.234
- You need me, <i>mano?</i>

15:07.773 --> 15:10.008
- Yo.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.111
You forgot somethin'.

15:16.548 --> 15:19.784
Go green!

15:19.786 --> 15:22.787
(door closes)

15:22.789 --> 15:25.256
Now let's go meet that guy
with the nigerians.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.395
(cries of reporters)

15:30.397 --> 15:32.931
- Ansel, I'm home!

15:34.633 --> 15:37.602
I made it!

15:47.379 --> 15:51.049
Ansel?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.452
I left this shirt out
for you, honey.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.289
I thought...

15:58.291 --> 16:01.125
Maybe you could get out
of your pyjamas today.

16:23.248 --> 16:27.318
Huh... Did your daddy
take you for a walk?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.687
That'd be nice.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.056
Everybody getting
in some air today.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.247
Of whom shall I be afraid?

18:07.519 --> 18:09.520
No one.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.589
No one. I'm not afraid.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.661
(sound of something
inside the shed.)

18:53.398 --> 18:56.367
Ansel?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.473
Ansel, is that you?

19:09.448 --> 19:12.316
Are you alright?

19:12.318 --> 19:15.153
Honey, are you hiding from me?

19:15.155 --> 19:18.189
(sounds of chains moving.)

19:19.258 --> 19:22.560
Why did you do that?

19:40.179 --> 19:44.248
Mother mary walk with me.

19:48.654 --> 19:52.190
Ansel? Honey?

19:57.062 --> 20:00.131
What's happened to you?

20:00.133 --> 20:03.134
I wanna help you.

20:03.136 --> 20:06.237
Let me. Please.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.643
- Raaaah!
Run.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.379
Go away.
Please, annie!

20:17.649 --> 20:19.417
(ansel growls.)
go!

20:19.419 --> 20:21.719
Don't come near me.
Never come back.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.491
The voice in my head...

20:27.493 --> 20:31.028
Is telling me to rip your throat
and drink from you.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.364
I need you.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.200
Lock the door and run,
ann marie.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.369
No matter what I say.

20:38.371 --> 20:41.606
Please, annie!
Go far away!

20:41.608 --> 20:44.675
- Ahhhh!

21:01.927 --> 21:05.563
- I'm closed for the day.
- It's still morning.

21:05.565 --> 21:09.033
- Thank you for
that profound observation.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.302
- Got something for you.
- Not today.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.875
Hm.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.078
I'm not in the business
of buying my own property back.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.881
- I'm returning it to you.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.887
- Well, I imagine that's
the only good news

21:29.889 --> 21:32.223
This day will bring.

21:32.225 --> 21:34.825
- Well, you're welcome.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.962
Asshole.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.232
- I coulda listened
to that old man.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.868
Taken the cabinet. Destroyed it.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.605
Now it's gone.

21:47.607 --> 21:51.609
There's a disease spreading
through the city.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.446
- What now?
- Well, we get outta here

21:55.448 --> 21:59.283
And we... Stop this thing

21:59.285 --> 22:02.586
Somehow. Even if nobody'll help.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.089
- How?

22:05.091 --> 22:07.992
- I don't know.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.198
- This is my fault.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.935
- No, it isn't.
- No, eph. It is.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.937
I waved that van through

22:19.939 --> 22:22.206
At the airport
after you sealed it.

22:22.208 --> 22:25.676
I was paid to do it.
The box was inside.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.847
- What?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.316
- I'm flat broke.
- What does that have to do

22:32.318 --> 22:35.019
With letting the box through?
- Go back.

22:37.456 --> 22:40.224
- This guy named greg nelson
approached me at a medical

22:40.226 --> 22:42.026
Convention. I mean he just
wanted to sell the cdc

22:42.028 --> 22:44.795
Some equipment, some ideas
about government contracts.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.964
I mean, I think I was targeted.
I'm-- I'm sure.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.567
- Who targeted you?
- They knew about my debt,

22:49.569 --> 22:51.635
Alright? They knew
about everything that

22:51.637 --> 22:54.338
Sylvia was going through.
I don't know how, but they did.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.474
I mean, I owed a lot
of money before she got sick.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.509
But after, with medical bills.
- You have insurance.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.579
- Sylvia is dying.
The cancer is everywhere.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.482
We ran every treatment they
offered and then we kept going.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.517
We did anything
that we thought made sense

23:06.519 --> 23:08.652
And the cost was insane.
- Are you saying this epidemic

23:08.654 --> 23:10.821
Was intentional?
That somebody planned this?

23:10.823 --> 23:12.690
Is that what you're saying?
- I don't know!

23:12.692 --> 23:15.493
I don't know. Alright?
They paid me a little bit

23:15.495 --> 23:17.428
Of money to do 'em a favour,
alright? And then the favours

23:17.430 --> 23:18.696
Kept getting bigger.
- And you waited 'til now

23:18.698 --> 23:20.564
To tell us?!
- They wanted me to clear a box

23:20.566 --> 23:22.666
From the airport. A box!

23:22.668 --> 23:26.604
It was soil. The readings were
negative. It was just soil!

23:26.606 --> 23:30.241
I would never hurt anybody.
Come on, you know me!

23:30.243 --> 23:32.543
We've been friends for 10 years,
all of us. Come on, please.

23:32.545 --> 23:35.413
- Where did they
take the coffin?

23:35.415 --> 23:38.082
- I-- I don't know.
- Who's behind all this?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.117
- Some scary prick, this...

23:40.119 --> 23:43.120
German guy. He threatened me.

23:43.122 --> 23:47.558
Come on. I'm on your team.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.428
You might not understand
this, eph,

23:50.430 --> 23:52.797
But I would do anything to keep
my wife alive--

23:55.434 --> 23:58.436
- Go to your wife.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.704
Call barnes. Call the police.
I don't care.

24:00.706 --> 24:02.907
- Agh...

24:02.909 --> 24:06.444
- You're dead to me.

24:15.487 --> 24:18.789
- There was nothing I could do.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.394
- No.

24:23.396 --> 24:25.796
Give me the phone.

24:30.735 --> 24:34.472
- Nora, please.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.424
(nora sighs)

24:53.426 --> 24:55.926
- I don't know
that guy back there.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.928
- Think of how desperate he must
have been to do something like--

24:57.930 --> 25:00.631
- Please don't make
excuses for him.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.033
- Just trying to imagine
if someone I was in love with

25:03.035 --> 25:06.537
Was dying. What I'd be
capable of doing.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.208
We need to find another victim.

25:11.210 --> 25:15.346
Setrakian said he knew
where the bodies were going.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.182
Back to their loved ones.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.655
- Emma arnot. Her father.
Jesus--

25:24.657 --> 25:26.790
- We'll bring her to
the hospital. Run some tests.

25:26.792 --> 25:30.194
- Then we'll have video
of both redfern and her.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.863
(engine whining)

25:32.865 --> 25:34.865
- I'll never get used
to this car.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.034
- You know I traded
my rolex for it back--

25:37.036 --> 25:39.770
- Yeah. I know. I know.

26:44.402 --> 26:47.137
(chicano rap playing)

26:51.042 --> 26:53.310
- Missed you, fool!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

26:55.914 --> 26:59.083
(crying)
- I hope you didn't suffer.

26:59.085 --> 27:03.654
Ansel is sick.

27:03.656 --> 27:07.758
Something... Is warping him.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.827
Inside.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.332
God only knows what he saw
on that plane.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.669
God damn airplanes!

27:18.671 --> 27:22.306
Like missiles, the way they rip
through everything.

27:26.277 --> 27:29.346
I asked him. You heard me.
But...

27:29.348 --> 27:33.250
Sometimes you can't...

27:33.252 --> 27:35.819
Speak about the things you see.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.924
- Hello?
Ann marie?

27:40.926 --> 27:43.160
(growling from shed)
oh my god.

27:43.162 --> 27:46.864
Yeah, hi. Hi.
Trip taylor, from next door.

27:48.433 --> 27:51.602
Wow. Little winter gardening?
- What do you want, mr. Taylor?

27:51.604 --> 27:53.771
- Ok, I am officially fed up
with this noise.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.707
Either you let the dog out
so she shuts up,

27:56.709 --> 27:58.676
Or, I don't know,
maybe train her to behave

27:58.678 --> 28:01.545
While she's locked in the shed.
This isn't rocket science.

28:01.547 --> 28:04.948
It's shameful to own a pet
and not discipline it.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.851
Oh, and speaking of filthy
animals, those press people

28:07.853 --> 28:10.721
Parked out front used
my mimosa tree as a piss post.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.790
Thank you very much for that.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.792
- I don't think you're going
to have to worry

28:14.794 --> 28:17.661
About the dog anymore.
- That's what your husband said

28:17.663 --> 28:20.064
The first time
your mutt tore up my yard.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.533
- What do you mean?

28:22.535 --> 28:25.636
- She entered my property
without permission.

28:25.638 --> 28:27.905
- You hit my dog?
- I didn't say that.

28:27.907 --> 28:31.175
(roaring)
- ok. I'm calling the police.

28:31.177 --> 28:35.212
This is outrageous.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.482
Please forgive me.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.651
If you want to go in there

28:40.653 --> 28:43.320
And teach her a few things--

28:43.322 --> 28:45.422
I don't have the heart for it.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.325
You're right about that.

28:48.327 --> 28:51.061
- Good.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.739
Oh, god.
Hey! Hey! Whoa!

29:01.741 --> 29:03.741
Whoa! What are you doing?

29:03.743 --> 29:05.743
What the hell?

29:05.745 --> 29:08.612
Ahhh!
No! No! Oh my god!

29:08.614 --> 29:11.749
(loud crash and then silence.)

29:16.054 --> 29:18.422
(growling)

29:27.899 --> 29:30.801
(hip hop music playing)

29:32.871 --> 29:35.472
- Gentlemen, sorry to interrupt.

29:37.375 --> 29:41.311
- Does this look like we open?
- Got something to sell.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.083
We hear you have
a real nice showroom.

29:46.085 --> 29:49.052
Like to add to it.
- That so?

29:49.054 --> 29:51.221
- It's out back.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.757
- Look, now's not a good time,
aight? Phones are down.

29:53.759 --> 29:56.794
Internet's not working, just--
- yeah well we here now.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.298
I mean if we ain't good enough
for you to do business with,

30:01.300 --> 30:04.768
Then we out.
- Wait.

30:04.770 --> 30:07.471
It's a brand new mercedes suv.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.817
- Let's see what you got.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.698
- It's colder than a goblin's
ass out here, huh? Ha! Ha!

30:34.700 --> 30:38.268
- Do your thang, home boy.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.711
(speaking in african)

30:47.713 --> 30:50.013
- What?

30:51.649 --> 30:53.684
(speaking spanish)

30:53.686 --> 30:55.953
(they continue speaking
in african.)

31:02.961 --> 31:04.962
- Still got a baby seat
in the back.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.931
- No extra charge for that.
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

31:09.801 --> 31:12.903
- Here's 400.
- What's that?

31:13.972 --> 31:16.974
We heard you pay a thousand.
- 400. You gonna take it or not?

31:16.976 --> 31:19.309
- Yeah.
- Nah.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.814
We got other stops
to make. Get in.

31:23.816 --> 31:26.149
- Get a word with you?

31:31.723 --> 31:33.724
- I should beat your big ass.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.492
- Why you always gotta
bring up my ass, man?

31:35.494 --> 31:38.328
Leave my ass out of this.
We're here, let's finish this.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.198
- That ugly silver toothed
punk could murk us

31:41.200 --> 31:44.234
For 400 lousy ass dollars
right now.

31:47.939 --> 31:51.608
You got your ratchet on you?
- Always ready, homie.

31:55.513 --> 31:58.348
- We leavin'.

32:06.557 --> 32:08.625
- 800.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.430
Get a full g next time
you come around.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.633
- You can bet on that.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.344
- Heh! Heh! Heh!

32:30.615 --> 32:34.217
- Forgive me for waking you,
sir. Your appointment's here.

32:34.219 --> 32:39.289
- I'm not asleep. It actually
hurts to keep my eyes open.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.992
- Sorry.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.494
The delivery is right on time.
Should be here soon.

32:44.496 --> 32:47.831
Most of the cell towers in
the city are reporting problems.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.833
The top seven internet server
farms have crashed.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.336
All the social networks
have gone dark.

32:52.338 --> 32:56.506
- Mmhm? That girl is
surprisingly reliable. Huh.

32:56.508 --> 33:00.477
Alright. Show maggie in.

33:08.186 --> 33:12.022
- Secretary pierson, mr. Palmer.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.324
- Please forgive me, maggie.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.960
- Eldritch.
- I know. Don't worry.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.997
I'll be better soon.
Please.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.105
- I had a phone call
from the white house today,

33:28.107 --> 33:31.108
An urgent one.
You need to understand

33:31.110 --> 33:35.178
What happened on that flight.
They will never tell you,

33:35.180 --> 33:38.248
But I feel it's
imperative you know.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.052
- The United States military
removed the bodies

33:42.054 --> 33:44.654
From the morgue.
In the middle of the night.

33:44.656 --> 33:48.058
- Why did they do that?

33:48.060 --> 33:50.660
- A highly classified
biological agent

33:50.662 --> 33:53.063
Got loose on that airplane.

33:53.065 --> 33:56.833
It was a tragic mistake.
Of epic proportions.

33:56.835 --> 34:00.303
But now we must do
what needs to be done.

34:00.305 --> 34:03.774
Without cowardice.
Without hesitation.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.784
- Those poor people.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.490
- What makes you powerful
and formidable

34:20.492 --> 34:24.061
Is also what makes a decision
like this so painful -

34:24.063 --> 34:26.329
Your decency.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.999
Maggie,

34:29.001 --> 34:31.868
We need you to put
your country first.

34:31.870 --> 34:35.005
Not the bullshit country
we pretend to be,

34:35.007 --> 34:37.107
The one we really are -

34:37.109 --> 34:39.576
The one you're getting
to know very well.

34:43.448 --> 34:45.549
- I saw that in you
from the start -

34:45.551 --> 34:50.187
The potential to get
the game behind the game.

34:53.891 --> 34:57.360
- I owe you my career, eldritch.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.732
Now what about the bioagent?
- Highly lethal,

35:02.734 --> 35:05.569
But it quickly dissipates;
designed so our troops

35:05.571 --> 35:09.606
Can follow it into battle.
That's why no one found it.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.310
It's gone. Done.

35:14.879 --> 35:17.681
Will you stand
with me on this, maggie?

35:19.217 --> 35:23.120
- Yes, I will.
Whatever you need.

35:24.455 --> 35:28.792
- Are you okay?
- I can't tell you how rare

35:28.794 --> 35:31.561
And valuable--

35:38.503 --> 35:41.671
- What's going on?
Where's maggie?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.740
- You passed out, sir.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.643
Once she was certain you were
ok, secretary pierson left.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.181
- Mr. Palmer.
Your new liver is here,

35:51.183 --> 35:53.583
It's in great shape.

35:53.585 --> 35:56.653
We need to prep you
for surgery right now.

35:58.689 --> 36:01.091
- Does eichorst know what
is happening to me?

36:01.093 --> 36:04.161
- We haven't been able
to reach him, sir.

36:05.830 --> 36:10.100
- Have they already forgotten
how much they need me?

36:10.102 --> 36:13.970
Why are they doing this?

36:13.972 --> 36:17.307
I was promised a miracle.

36:17.309 --> 36:20.177
- We have a healthy liver
for you. That's the miracle.

36:21.779 --> 36:25.882
- Eldritch, you are
in fulminant hepatic failure.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.554
- Yes, yes - you have
my consent. Get on with it.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.390
- Excellent. Let's get him
into surgery now.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.908
- Hello?

36:51.910 --> 36:55.378
It's ephraim goodweather
from the cdc.

36:57.815 --> 37:00.750
- Mr. Arnot?

37:05.823 --> 37:08.592
(children's music playing.)

37:17.235 --> 37:20.170
- â™ª <i>this old man,</i>
<i>he played two</i> â™ª

37:20.172 --> 37:22.339
â™ª <i>he played knick-knack</i>
<i>on my shoe</i> â™ª

37:22.341 --> 37:25.208
â™ª <i>with a knick-knack paddy-whack</i>

37:25.210 --> 37:27.410
â™ª <i>this old man</i>

37:27.412 --> 37:27.577
â™ª

37:29.180 --> 37:32.048
â™ª <i>this old man,</i>
<i>he played three</i> â™ª

37:32.050 --> 37:34.851
â™ª <i>he played knick-knack</i>
<i>on my tree</i> â™ª

37:34.853 --> 37:37.287
â™ª <i>with a knick-knack paddy-whack</i>
<i>give a dog a bone</i> â™ª

37:37.289 --> 37:39.923
â™ª <i>this old man</i>
<i>came rolling home</i> â™ª

37:39.925 --> 37:40.090
â™ª

37:42.693 --> 37:44.794
â™ª <i>this old man,</i>
<i>he played four</i> â™ª

37:44.796 --> 37:47.897
â™ª <i>he played knick-knack</i>

37:47.899 --> 37:50.300
â™ª <i>with a knick-knack paddy-whack</i>

37:50.302 --> 37:52.702
â™ª <i>this old man</i>

37:55.473 --> 37:57.741
â™ª <i>this old man,</i>

37:57.743 --> 38:00.644
â™ª <i>he played knick-knack</i>

â™ª <i>with a knick-knack paddy-whack</i>

38:03.148 --> 38:05.448
(growling)
- emma?

38:19.563 --> 38:22.832
- Arnot! Hey!

38:22.834 --> 38:24.901
- Oh god!

38:26.837 --> 38:28.738
Ahhh! God!

38:28.740 --> 38:30.940
- Move away. He'll be right
behind her.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.777
They need to find shelter
before the sunrise. Move!

38:33.779 --> 38:36.313
Get out of the way!

38:40.584 --> 38:42.986
<i>Sabia mea fredoneaza</i>
<i>de argint.</i>

38:46.624 --> 38:48.625
- Are you ok?
Are you ok?

38:48.627 --> 38:50.627
- Keep away from the bodies.
The worms, don't let them

38:50.629 --> 38:53.530
Touch you.
- What have you done?

38:53.532 --> 38:55.932
- Among other things,
I just saved your life.

38:55.934 --> 39:00.103
- We have resources, protocols.
- Not for this.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.372
There's no other way.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.075
- I can't stay down here.

39:11.449 --> 39:14.951
- There are two containers full
of gasoline in the garage.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.187
We have to finish this.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.923
Burn them.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.697
(nora crying.)
- nora.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.967
- Just-- just, no. Don't.
Just let me go.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.370
- No, no, no. Please.
Please.

39:33.372 --> 39:36.339
- We're not doing this.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.575
We were talking
about finding a cure.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.810
- That was before we knew
how quickly it spreads.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.812
We have to do this with him.
It's our only shot.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.814
- Oh, come on, eph!
We don't exterminate

39:44.816 --> 39:46.850
Our patients
when there's an outbreak.

39:46.852 --> 39:50.520
- The chinese culled the bird
population in hong kong

39:50.522 --> 39:53.556
After the avian flu hit. It was
the responsible thing to do.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.159
- We're not hunting down
human beings.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.528
- They're hunting us!

39:58.530 --> 40:01.264
Where do you think
that blood came from?

40:01.266 --> 40:04.834
Arnot was out there
killing innocent people.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.903
Nora, please--

40:12.443 --> 40:15.278
- That was a little girl
in there.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.515
I mean, how old was emma?
Eight, tops?

40:20.551 --> 40:24.354
She was sick but--
- no. She was gone.

40:24.356 --> 40:28.258
There was something
inside her shell.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.961
That was a body
controlled by a virus.

40:31.963 --> 40:35.465
- This is what we do.
The people of new york rely

40:35.467 --> 40:38.435
On us to investigate
- and eliminate -

40:38.437 --> 40:42.105
Threats to their health.
And now, when it finally means

40:42.107 --> 40:45.041
Something, we're gonna run?

40:45.043 --> 40:48.311
- I am not doing this. I'm not.

40:48.313 --> 40:51.414
I'd rather die from
whatever this epidemic is

40:51.416 --> 40:54.717
Than kill people!

41:00.791 --> 41:04.060
- This, it's...
Not for everyone.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.296
- Are you going to murder
everyone on that list of yours?

41:06.298 --> 41:10.233
- Yes.

41:10.235 --> 41:13.169
I assume you're not
staying with us.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.979
- No.

41:24.348 --> 41:27.650
- Please be safe.

41:29.753 --> 41:33.356
Promise me.

41:33.358 --> 41:36.659
- There has to be another way.

41:44.435 --> 41:47.670
- Some brains... Can't adjust.

41:47.672 --> 41:51.274
I can see you love her
for that...

41:51.276 --> 41:53.910
But you have to let her go.

41:56.981 --> 41:59.082
Get the gasoline.
