WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:10.507
Working together with Videl,

00:10.719 --> 00:14.928
the Great Saiyaman saves
the baby monster from Musuka.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.719
Morning, Son Gohan-kun.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.812
You can't hide it anymore.
The Great Saiyaman's true identity

00:24.024 --> 00:26.356
is you, Son Gohan-kun, isn't it?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.900
O-Oh, no! And after I'd gone through

00:29.113 --> 00:32.604
such a complete transformation...

00:32.825 --> 00:39.617
Videl has finally seen through
the Great Saiyaman's secret identity.

00:39.832 --> 00:42.915
Gohan was then intimidated by Videl

00:43.127 --> 00:46.210
into entering the Tenkaichi Budokai.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.167
This whatever-it's-called tournament...

00:49.383 --> 00:52.090
If you're going to enter,
then I'm entering, too.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.838
I'm entering, too!

00:54.054 --> 00:55.294
Long time no see, everyone!

00:55.514 --> 00:58.347
Can you really come to
the Tenkaichi Budokai?!

00:58.559 --> 01:04.144
Yeah. If you ask Uranai Baba,
you can come back for one day.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.564
I'm gonna make it the day
of the Tenkaichi Budokai.

01:07.776 --> 01:12.770
Incredibly, Goku is coming back
from the Next World for one day

01:12.990 --> 01:17.029
to participate in the Tenkaichi Budokai!

"Entering the Tenkaichi Budokai!

02:48.627 --> 02:53.041
Goten Shows Off His Explosive
Power During Training!"

02:55.676 --> 02:57.837
Eh?!

02:58.053 --> 03:00.715
Goku, too?! You mean it?!

03:02.307 --> 03:06.220
This is Kuririn-san, who gave up shaving
his head after he stopped fighting.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.018
It's been a long time since we've seen Goku.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.689
The Tenkaichi Budokai, huh?
Maybe I'll enter, too.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.892
Yes, enter with the rest of us!

03:15.112 --> 03:18.445
B-But if Goku and Vegeta are entering,

03:18.657 --> 03:22.024
I don't have a chance of winning.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.111
Besides, what would my wife say?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.664
There, there...

03:32.880 --> 03:34.666
You should still enter.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.123
I hear there will be prizes up to 5th place.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.754
How much prize money are they offering?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.807
Let's see... The grand prize is 10 million Zeni,

03:47.019 --> 03:49.351
2nd place is 5 million, 3rd place is 3 million,

03:49.563 --> 03:53.181
4th place is 2 million,
and 5th place is 1 million Zeni, I think.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.767
Enter it, Kuririn! I'm going, too!

03:58.030 --> 04:01.488
1 million Zeni! 1 million Zeni!

04:01.700 --> 04:03.236
Okay? Enter it, Kuririn.

04:03.452 --> 04:04.908
Daddy, enter, enter!

04:05.120 --> 04:07.452
Yeah, I guess I'll try.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.747
|-| wonder if I should...

04:13.253 --> 04:15.369
Hey, keep this from Piccolo.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.002
Otherwise my chances of getting
to within 5th place will go down.

04:19.216 --> 04:22.050
No, I can't really do that.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.380
By the way, what are you doing,
wearing that weird, lame outfit?

04:27.392 --> 04:30.259
What are you talking about?! This is so cool!

04:30.479 --> 04:33.391
Kuririn-san, your sense of style has gone dull!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.609
Bye!

04:42.407 --> 04:45.820
Is that right? That truly
does sound interesting.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.402
--Doesn't it?
--All right, I think I'll enter.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.114
Yeah, good luck! Popo root for you!

04:52.334 --> 04:53.744
What about you, Dende?

04:53.961 --> 04:59.206
No, I'm not entering. I'm not a
combat-type Namekian, after all.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.212
By the way, Gohan, what's the story
with that weird outfit?

05:03.428 --> 05:08.718
Eh?! Oh, no, not you too, Piccolo-san!
Don't you think this is cool?

05:08.934 --> 05:11.596
|-| can't tell.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.427
Popo either.

05:19.945 --> 05:24.359
I don't know where Tenshinhan-san is,
so I can't ask him.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.158
I think Bulma-san will contact Yamucha-san.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.486
That just leaves Mother and Goten.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.163
But when Mother hears that Father
will be back for even one day,

05:33.375 --> 05:36.367
I'm sure she'll be delighted.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.955
And Goten will see his father
for the first time, won't he?

05:41.174 --> 05:44.132
Then again, will Mother give me permission

05:44.344 --> 05:47.461
to enter the Tenkaichi Budokai?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.548
If I'm going to enter at all, I want to win it.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.684
But since I've gotten soft,
I'll have to stay home from school

05:54.896 --> 05:57.808
and train like crazy,
or there's a risk I won't do so.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.067
Eh?!

06:02.279 --> 06:04.565
You say Goku-sa's comin'
back from the Next World

06:04.781 --> 06:06.521
to enter the Tenkaichi Budokai?!

06:06.742 --> 06:10.485
Why didn't you tell me big news
like that any sooner?!

06:10.704 --> 06:13.320
Isn't that great, Goten?!

06:13.540 --> 06:16.623
You'll be able to see your pa
for one whole day!

06:18.045 --> 06:21.378
Land sakes, I'm the only one
who's gotten older!

06:21.590 --> 06:23.421
You don't age in the Next World, right?

06:23.633 --> 06:26.796
I should have been goin' to the beauty salon!

06:27.012 --> 06:32.223
How long has it been?
Seven years? Well, I'll be...!

06:32.434 --> 06:35.471
So he's comin' back, is he?

06:35.687 --> 06:40.932
Um, Mother, I wonder if I might
enter the Tenkaichi Budokai, too?

06:41.151 --> 06:44.143
I'll get all gussied up, and-- Eh?

06:44.362 --> 06:47.069
If I win, l'll receive 10 million Zeni.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.273
Even 2nd place is 5 million Zeni.

06:49.493 --> 06:52.235
T-Ten million Zeni?!

06:52.454 --> 06:55.321
Enter it, Gohan-Chan! With you and Goku-sa,

06:55.540 --> 06:58.498
we can get 15 million in prize money!

06:58.710 --> 07:01.952
W-Well, there's no guarantee that I'll win...

07:02.172 --> 07:06.211
No! One of you is bound to win it!

07:06.426 --> 07:07.836
But in order to do so,

07:08.053 --> 07:10.510
I'll have to take some time off
from school to train...

07:10.722 --> 07:14.556
I don't care! Train!
You can always make it up afterward!

07:14.768 --> 07:16.474
Wow, it's a blessin' from Heaven!

07:16.686 --> 07:18.813
Pa's fortune is startin' to run out,

07:19.022 --> 07:22.105
and I didn't know what we were goin' to do!

07:25.153 --> 07:27.815
Goten, will you give your big brother

07:28.031 --> 07:29.942
a hand with his training that starts tomorrow?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.659
Uh-huh.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.485
I think I'll start off by turning Super Saiyan.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.577
All right, how about we get started?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.290
Yeah!

08:28.508 --> 08:32.717
You're tickling me!
Come on, cut it out! Come on!

08:36.433 --> 08:39.174
Wah! Come on, cut it out, I said!

08:59.956 --> 09:01.241
Big Brother! Big Brother!

09:01.458 --> 09:02.948
Wow, this is so cute!

09:03.168 --> 09:04.283
W-What is it?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.242
Look! A bug!

09:06.463 --> 09:08.454
Y-Yeah...

09:19.726 --> 09:21.466
Big Brother! Big Brother!

09:21.686 --> 09:23.893
Look! I found a lizard!

09:24.105 --> 09:26.061
Hey, what are you doing, Goten?!

09:26.274 --> 09:28.811
It's not like we came here to play, you know!

09:29.027 --> 09:31.484
Why don't you do some push-ups
or something over there

09:31.696 --> 09:33.687
and do some training?!

09:33.907 --> 09:36.273
I can't focus if you're distracting me, can I?!

09:36.493 --> 09:37.983
For crying out loud!

09:57.555 --> 09:59.295
Big Brother! Big Brother!

09:59.516 --> 10:01.677
Geez, what is it this time, Goten?!

10:01.893 --> 10:05.761
Brother, I caught an amazing dinosaur!

10:05.981 --> 10:07.471
See?

10:14.698 --> 10:16.188
Watch out!

10:22.664 --> 10:23.995
Are you okay, Goten?

10:24.207 --> 10:25.492
Ah, he startled me.

10:25.709 --> 10:29.372
Sheesh, what are you doing?
That's dangerous, you know.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.330
Don't do anything else.
Just sit there, and stay still.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.132
Okay, I will, Big Brother.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.400
Goten!

11:01.619 --> 11:04.076
Would you come give your
big brother a hand with his training?

11:04.289 --> 11:05.779
Uh-huh!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.782
That should do it.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.709
What are we going to do with
all these rocks, Big Brother?

11:11.921 --> 11:14.958
We're going to use them to train me
so I can get my reflexive instincts back.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.791
What's "reflexive instincts," Big Brother?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.842
You're going to find out right now.

11:20.055 --> 11:24.719
Goten, face me from this line
and throw these rocks at me,

11:24.934 --> 11:26.094
like you mean business.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.142
Uh-huh, got it.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.555
All right, ready, Goten! Throw them!

11:31.775 --> 11:34.562
Huh? You want me to do it from this close?

11:34.778 --> 11:36.860
Actually, you should do it from even closer,

11:37.072 --> 11:38.983
but I think we ought to
start from around there.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.815
Really? You won't get hurt?

11:42.035 --> 11:45.653
It'll be fine. Just throw them
as hard as you can.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.114
Hmm... Okay, here goes, Big Brother.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.323
Okay, bring it on!

11:50.543 --> 11:53.159
Ready... set...

11:56.383 --> 11:58.339
Wow, you're right!

11:58.551 --> 12:01.759
Amazing! That's my big brother!

12:03.973 --> 12:05.133
Okay, here come the rest.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.339
Whoa, hold on, hold on!

12:06.559 --> 12:08.424
Time out, time out, Goten!

12:08.645 --> 12:10.306
On second thought,
I think I'll have you throw them

12:10.522 --> 12:13.138
from back here, Goten.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.599
Uh-huh, okay, Big Brother.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.192
All right, I'm starting to get used to this.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.745
Goten, you can get closer now!

12:28.957 --> 12:31.198
You can get even closer now!

12:32.836 --> 12:34.372
W-What's the matter, Goten?

12:34.587 --> 12:38.921
Say, is it okay if I become
like you, too, Big Brother?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.999
What do you mean, like me?

12:41.219 --> 12:44.256
I want to become that
"Super Saiyan" thing you are.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.973
Huh?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.304
Sure you can,

12:51.521 --> 12:55.389
but I think that still may be
a bit much for you, Goten.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.317
Going Super Saiyan, see,
comes after some fairly harsh training.

12:59.529 --> 13:03.272
And even at that,
it takes anger to finally trigger--

13:40.820 --> 13:45.109
G-Goten... H-How long have
you been able to do that?!

13:45.325 --> 13:47.236
Hmm...

13:47.452 --> 13:48.282
I forgot.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.987
U-Unbelievable! Your big
brother and our late father

13:52.207 --> 13:56.166
had to work awfully hard
to become Super Saiyan.

13:57.962 --> 14:02.296
Say, Goten, do you want to try
sparring with your big brother?

14:02.509 --> 14:03.919
Do you know what sparring is?

14:04.135 --> 14:08.754
Uh-huh! Mother shows me a lot
while you're studying, Big Brother.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.088
Mother does?

14:10.308 --> 14:11.798
Uh-huh.

14:14.521 --> 14:19.060
I guess Mother really has changed
a little bit since Father died.

14:19.275 --> 14:23.234
She said earlier that I could take off
from school to train, as well...

14:25.240 --> 14:26.730
Hey, Goten...

14:26.950 --> 14:30.818
Does Mother know that
you can turn Super Saiyan?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.538
Uh-huh.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.292
Come on, Goten!

14:40.505 --> 14:45.169
Your dead pa would laugh at you like that!

14:50.974 --> 14:53.181
--Ow-w-w...
--Mother!

14:53.393 --> 14:55.133
I'm
s
o
rryI

14:55.353 --> 14:57.389
Go-- Go-- Go--

14:59.065 --> 15:00.475
Mother...

15:00.692 --> 15:06.062
Waah! Goten-Chan's gone
and turned delinquent, too!

15:11.661 --> 15:14.573
The first time I showed her,
she got mad at me.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.701
She said I looked like a delinquent,
so I couldn't do it anymore.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.044
Mother hates us being Super Saiyan, after all!

15:30.054 --> 15:32.306
All right, ready, Goten! Come on!

15:53.202 --> 15:55.488
Ah! No fair, Big Brother!

15:55.705 --> 15:58.663
You can't fly away! No fair, no fair!

15:58.875 --> 16:00.661
Huh? Why not?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.744
Why not? Because no fair is no fair!

16:03.963 --> 16:09.458
Huh? What do you mean?
Don't tell me you can't fly!

16:09.677 --> 16:11.838
But you can turn Super Saiyan?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.340
No, I can't!

16:13.556 --> 16:16.343
Heh, you've got the order all out of whack.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.925
Big Brother! If you're going to fly,

16:19.145 --> 16:21.727
you have to teach me how, too, or it isn't fair!

16:21.939 --> 16:25.147
All right, all right! Don't get angry!

16:25.360 --> 16:27.942
Goten, I'll teach you how to fly!

16:28.154 --> 16:29.690
Wow, really?!

16:29.906 --> 16:33.319
--Yeah!
--Wow! Hooray!

16:33.534 --> 16:36.901
Hooray! Hooray! That's great!

16:43.378 --> 16:45.994
Is that...? It couldn't be...

16:50.134 --> 16:51.795
V-Videl-san!

16:53.971 --> 16:55.381
Th-That's right!

16:55.598 --> 17:00.137
I just remembered, Videl-san asked me
to teach her how to fly, too!

17:00.353 --> 17:01.809
Big Brother, what's the matter?

17:02.021 --> 17:05.387
Oh, nothing. It looks like you're
going to have some company, Goten.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.769
I'm having company?

17:07.984 --> 17:10.896
Listen, Goten, there's a girl coming here

17:11.114 --> 17:14.071
who goes to the same school
as your big brother.

17:14.282 --> 17:18.117
You can't show her how strong you are, okay?

17:18.329 --> 17:22.163
And you especially can't turn Super Saiyan!

17:22.375 --> 17:26.334
Oh, right! Because she'll
think I'm a delinquent?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.788
Hmm... Well, something like that.

17:30.007 --> 17:30.962
Come on, let's hurry back!

17:31.175 --> 17:32.676
Uh-huh!

17:47.525 --> 17:49.982
You know, Big Brother, you really are amazing.

17:50.194 --> 17:54.654
I didn't hit you even once!
I've still got a long way to go!

17:54.866 --> 17:57.778
Goten, you've got some
incredible fighting talent yourself!

17:57.994 --> 18:01.407
You surprised me!
I didn't know you could do that well!

18:01.622 --> 18:02.998
If you train good and hard,

18:03.207 --> 18:06.324
maybe you can enter
the Tenkaichi Budokai, too!

18:06.544 --> 18:11.584
Really?! But Trunks-kun
is even stronger than I am!

18:11.799 --> 18:16.213
When we do play-fighting,
there's no way I can keep up with him!

18:16.429 --> 18:20.763
R-Really?! Y-You guys do that when you play?!

18:20.975 --> 18:23.057
Uh-huh! It's fun!

18:24.061 --> 18:27.974
I-If I'm not careful, I'm going
to let myself be overtaken

18:28.191 --> 18:29.681
by these little guys.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.440
Listen here!

18:35.656 --> 18:37.112
Tell me the truth!

18:37.325 --> 18:40.863
You're not here invitin' my
Gohan-Chan on a date, are you?

18:41.078 --> 18:43.160
I told you I'm not, didn't I?

18:45.082 --> 18:46.458
Hey!

18:46.667 --> 18:47.918
Mother, we're home!

18:48.127 --> 18:48.832
Welcome back.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.162
V-Videl-san, I'm surprised
you found this place.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.542
Looking at the class roll, it was simple.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.215
O-Oh, right.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.837
But never mind that, what is this?!

18:58.054 --> 19:00.090
Submitting a leave of absence form
without saying anything?!

19:00.306 --> 19:02.968
You promised to teach me how to fly, right?!

19:03.184 --> 19:05.175
U-Uh, of course I'll teach you.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.055
Gohan-Chan!

19:07.271 --> 19:11.264
Is it true that this girl is
enterin' the tournament, too?

19:11.484 --> 19:15.477
It's true, Mother. Videl-san here
is the one who told me

19:15.696 --> 19:18.688
about the Tenkaichi Budokai in the first place.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.071
Hmm... Well in that case, okay.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.743
And you! Don't go doin' anythin'
X-rated to my Gohan-Chan

19:24.956 --> 19:26.821
and sayin' you're thankin' him.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.704
There's no way I'm going
to do something like that!

19:33.464 --> 19:34.749
You!

19:34.966 --> 19:38.333
You're not thinkin' of enterin'
the Tenkaichi Budokai together

19:38.553 --> 19:42.671
and usin' it to marry Gohan-Chan
there on the spot, are you?!

19:42.890 --> 19:47.008
No, I'm not! And why would
anyone have to get married

19:47.228 --> 19:48.764
at the Tenkaichi Budokai?!

19:48.980 --> 19:54.350
Well, my father and mother got
married at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

19:58.072 --> 20:03.317
Oh, my word, Goten!
You're embarrassin' me, you know that?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.572
W-What a weirdo.

20:08.624 --> 20:12.537
The Tenkaichi Budokai
where I fought Goku-sa...

20:15.548 --> 20:17.630
Then our marriage...

20:24.682 --> 20:29.767
Ah, they're all such good memories.

20:29.979 --> 20:30.809
But even so!

20:31.022 --> 20:33.764
When it comes to you and Gohan-Chan,
it's another story!

20:33.983 --> 20:36.144
I told you that's never
going to happen, didn't I?!

20:36.360 --> 20:38.396
Geez, don't even say such a ridiculous thing!

20:38.613 --> 20:39.773
What?!

20:39.989 --> 20:41.149
Neener!

20:41.365 --> 20:42.775
Nyah!

20:42.992 --> 20:43.981
Neener!

20:44.201 --> 20:45.281
Nyah!

20:45.494 --> 20:46.358
Neener!

20:46.579 --> 20:47.443
Nyah!

20:47.663 --> 20:48.527
Neener!

20:48.748 --> 20:49.612
Nyah!

20:49.832 --> 20:53.700
Only one month remains
until the Tenkaichi Budokai.

20:53.920 --> 20:58.004
Are you sure you should be
dealing with Videl now, Gohan?

21:00.676 --> 21:04.715
It doesn't look like I'll be able
to train in peace for a while, huh?

21:06.307 --> 21:09.674
I've got to say, though, Goten...

21:09.894 --> 21:15.434
As small as he is, Goten packs
an amazing hidden power.

21:18.402 --> 21:22.145
I really can't afford not
to get on the ball, either.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.187
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.404 --> 22:47.397
Not bad! Imagine, learning how
to fly in just one day!

22:47.616 --> 22:49.948
This girl Videl ain't your average customer!

22:50.161 --> 22:53.153
Hmph, your brother is having
an easier time flying than I am,

22:53.372 --> 22:56.330
isn't he, Gohan-kun? I'll be back
tomorrow, so teach me more, okay?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.157
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.377 --> 23:01.619
"Gohan the Teacher!
Videl's Flying Technique Tutorial."

23:01.839 --> 23:05.878
Eep, I'm not going to be able
to do my own training like this!
