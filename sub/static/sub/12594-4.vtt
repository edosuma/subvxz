00:02.500 --> 00:05.628
***

00:05.670 --> 00:08.798
- Sir, this isn't a bank card.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.559
- Ah, sorry.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.602
It's my ID.
I'm a private investigator.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.074
- Not a very private
one, apparently.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.340
- Yeah.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.648
- You did that on purpose.
- Come on, honey.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.250
I just got this
bad boy yesterday,

00:26.290 --> 00:28.258
so what if I'm a little excited?

00:28.290 --> 00:31.088
My study partner's gonna be here
any second and I'd appreciate it

00:31.130 --> 00:33.621
if you turn down the weird.
- Most kids would be proud

00:33.660 --> 00:37.528
to have a P.I. for a father.
Think of me as a modern
day Thomas Magnum.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.200
Oceanfront estate,
red Ferrari, epic moustache?

00:42.240 --> 00:45.334
Nothing? Fine, Jim Rockford.

00:45.370 --> 00:48.168
- That name just sounds made up.
- My name sounds made up.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.804
Phillip Marlowe. Sam Spade?
: Veronica Mars.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.675
If it isn't Angie Everett,
my partner. Partner.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.314
It still sounds strange
when I say it out loud.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.580
- That's because
you're my employee.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.724
- Right.
- Hi, Jules.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.524
- Hi, Angie. Did you know my
dad's a private investigator?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.824
- No way.
- Yeah.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.829
- OK, don't say anything stupid.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.134
Or you know what? Just don't
say anything at all. Thanks.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.536
- Hey, Jules.
- Hey. Liam, Dad.

01:15.570 --> 01:17.663
Dad, Liam. And Angie.
She's my dad's boss.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.702
- Woman's in charge. Right on.

01:20.740 --> 01:23.675
Oh, I got your bag.
- Thanks.

01:23.710 --> 01:26.349
- No problem.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.486
So how are you doing?

01:29.520 --> 01:31.408
Isn't he a little slick
for a 14

01:31.450 --> 01:35.159
- I think he's cute!
IfI was 14.

01:35.190 --> 01:39.593
Everett Investigations.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.655
Yes, Mr. King.
I know who you are.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.329
Oh, my goodness.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.589
Of course, we'll be right there.
What's going on?

01:48.640 --> 01:51.529
- That was Thomas
King, the author. Frank
Garrison's in the hospital.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.674
- I'll do the talking.

01:53.710 --> 01:56.702
- OK.
- Yeah. Come on!

01:56.750 --> 01:58.706
- Mm-hmm.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.674
***

02:05.890 --> 02:09.781
- You know, once,
Frank tried to wrestle a bear.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.458
It was in a bar
in St. Petersburg.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.594
Remember that? We were
at a writer's conference.

02:15.630 --> 02:19.532
I'm not gonna lie:
there was vodka involved.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.767
It's hard to see him
like this.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.461
He's one of the great
writers of our generation.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.934
- A true genius.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.676
- When did he first
reach out to you, Mr. King?

02:31.710 --> 02:35.749
- Call me Tom. I_haven't
spoken to Frank In years.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.941
I think he was pissed
after I won

02:37.990 --> 02:41.812
the Governor General's Award.
He could be a mean-spirited
son of a bitch.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.579
Last week,
this arrived in the mail.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.889
- "In the event of my death,
or that I have been rendered

02:49.930 --> 02:52.694
incapacitated, please
press the play button."

02:52.740 --> 02:55.664
- I thought it was a joke
at first. I mean,

02:55.700 --> 02:58.703
Frank's a notorious
technophobe, holed up in his

02:58.740 --> 03:01.300
little shack on Ward's Island.
And then this morning

03:01.340 --> 03:04.673
I hear that his house
had burned down.

03:04.710 --> 03:08.817
- Hi, Tom. I guess if
you're watching this

03:08.850 --> 03:11.819
I'm either dead or
I'm in a coma near death,

03:11.850 --> 03:14.614
or you've just chosen
to ignore my note,

03:14.660 --> 03:17.754
in which case I should've
gone with Michael Ondaatje.

03:17.790 --> 03:20.691
- Son of a bitch.
- All I want you to do here

03:20.730 --> 03:24.518
is find the most impressive
private investigators
in the city

03:24.570 --> 03:27.994
and then I want you to get them
to look into what the heck

03:28.040 --> 03:30.668
is happening here.
There's two envelopes.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.678
Open up the blue envelope.

03:32.710 --> 03:37.773
Alright. That should be
enough to pay their expenses.

03:37.810 --> 03:41.849
OK. Open up the other
envelope, the red one.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.849
I found these on
my windowsill last night.

03:44.890 --> 03:47.017
There they were, lined up there,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.016
like five little
brass tombstones.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.599
Somebody on this crazy little
island's trying to kill me.

03:53.630 --> 03:56.895
Tom, remember I said this.
Trust no one.

03:59.770 --> 04:04.309
- ** I see you and you see me

04:04.340 --> 04:07.798
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

04:07.840 --> 04:11.298
* Oh boy, you've got to know

04:11.350 --> 04:13.477
* What my head overlooks

04:13.520 --> 04:16.944
* The senses will show
to my heart *

04:16.990 --> 04:19.811
* When it's watching for lies

04:19.860 --> 04:21.919
* 'Cause you can't escape my

04:21.960 --> 04:23.825
* Private Eyes

04:23.860 --> 04:26.294
* They're watching you

04:26.330 --> 04:28.890
* Private Eyes

04:28.930 --> 04:30.864
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

04:30.900 --> 04:34.836
* Watching you *

04:34.870 --> 04:36.861
***

04:40.340 --> 04:43.639
- Why are you so excited about
this old hack writer anyhow?

04:43.680 --> 04:46.046
- Frank Garrison is not a hack.
This is the man who wrote

04:46.080 --> 04:48.514
The Devil's Playground,
one of the most important books

04:48.550 --> 04:50.518
of the last hundred years.
- I Googled him.

04:50.550 --> 04:52.609
He wrote one book
25 years ago and gave up.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.685
- Can you blame him,
after the Lovegrove incident?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.925
Didn't you take English Lit?

04:58.960 --> 05:01.895
- The Devil's Playground
was set in the 19th century,

05:01.930 --> 05:04.728
but really it's an allegory
for dirty political dealings

05:04.770 --> 05:07.637
in the 19905.
The uncle character was based

05:07.670 --> 05:09.706
on a Conservative senator
named Christopher Lovegrove.

05:09.740 --> 05:12.504
- Oh, I remember that guy.
He killed himself, didn't he?

05:12.540 --> 05:14.804
- Senator Lovegrove did
everything he could to trample

05:14.840 --> 05:17.070
gay rights, yet he was
deep in the closet himself.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.874
When the media found out who the
uncle character was based on,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.774
his secret was revealed.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.685
Lovegrove killed himself
a week after it was published,

05:23.720 --> 05:25.688
the novel on his lap.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.915
- Well, that's why I didn't
read the book. It's bad luck.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.884
- It's also a masterpiece.
I read it every couple of years.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.422
- Andre Agassi's biography
is a masterpiece and I
only read that once.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.860
- Did you manage to colour
between the lines?

05:36.900 --> 05:40.392
***

05:40.440 --> 05:43.102
Frank's house is
a 10-minute walk. Let's go.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.774
This place gives me the creeps.

05:47.810 --> 05:50.608
This place is fantastic!
My Dad brought me here

05:50.650 --> 05:52.777
when I was a kid. I wanted to
pitch a tent and stay forever.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.119
- Makes sense when you're eight.
- This island has everything:

05:56.150 --> 05:59.017
the best views of the city,
a haunted lighthouse,

05:59.050 --> 06:01.484
rumours of mobsters in hiding.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.078
Did you know that Babe Ruth

06:03.130 --> 06:05.086
hit his very first
professional home run

06:05.130 --> 06:07.758
into those waters right there?
- I was standing next to you

06:07.800 --> 06:11.167
when you were reading
the historical plaques.
- So we're finally reading

06:11.200 --> 06:13.839
the same things!

06:13.870 --> 06:16.134
Wow. That was some fire.
- Yeah.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.604
Let's get to work. You get
some snaps of the house,

06:18.640 --> 06:21.006
I'll go see if I can learn
anything from the firemen.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.769
You're going to go
talk to the firemen?

06:22.810 --> 06:25.802
Isn't that a bit of a clich?
Women and firemen?

06:25.850 --> 06:28.011
Sounds like a real bodice
ripper. A potboiler.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.809
Who's the literary one now?

06:37.760 --> 06:42.129
- OK. Looks like the fire
happened between 1 and 2 am.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.765
I'm gonna check if Mazhari
can pull up the CCTV footage

06:44.800 --> 06:47.689
of the harbour. Ferries don't
run between 10 pm. and dawn,

06:47.740 --> 06:49.833
so if there are no personal
watercraft leaving the island,

06:49.870 --> 06:51.906
it's likely the
arsonist lives here.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.875
- Or there is no arsonist and
that's the reason for the fire.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.504
Lotta hard liquor for one man.
- He's a writer. Sometimes

06:57.550 --> 06:59.848
it comes with the territory.
- It also makes a great

06:59.880 --> 07:01.814
accelerant. I once made
a Molotov cocktail

07:01.850 --> 07:03.511
out of a cheap
bottle of bourbon.

07:03.550 --> 07:07.611
I didn't find
that in the background check.
- Time for you to up your game.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.821
Come on, think about it.
Garrison gets drunk,

07:09.860 --> 07:12.454
decides to light up
a smoke, and poof!

07:12.500 --> 07:14.718
- We've been hired to find
a would-be killer, not speculate

07:14.760 --> 07:17.092
on accidents. Frank said
this island is full of crazy,

07:17.130 --> 07:20.691
and_I believe him.
- I'm starting to come around.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.005
Don't look now:
peeping Tom, 5 o'clock.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.002
- Beginning to feel like
we're in a Coen Brothers movie.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.917
- You take the high road,
I'll take the low.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.948
- There's a lot of suspects,
but we're honing in on one.

07:38.990 --> 07:41.618
You're not gonna believe
who the culprit is...

07:41.660 --> 07:43.981
- She does drone on,
doesn't she?

07:44.030 --> 07:48.490
- Uh, I...

07:50.700 --> 07:52.634
- Larry Fleishman.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.638
This is not what it looks like.

07:54.670 --> 07:58.265
- You mean you weren't recording
my partner pretending to
talk on the phone?

07:58.310 --> 08:00.904
- OK, it is what it looks like.
This is what I do for a living.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.773
- I'm a composer.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.142
I make ambient
soundscapes for spas.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.740
I was trying to catch
a rare piping plover.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.748
She makes the sweetest
little cheeps.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.282
- And this plover resides
in the remains of Frank
Garrison's house?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.788
- I wanted to_ know
what was gomg on.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.786
- Where were you between 1 am.
and 2 am. this morning?

08:18.830 --> 08:20.855
- At the south end of the
island, atop the lighthouse.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.619
All my sound logs are
digitally timestamped. Um...

08:23.670 --> 08:28.630
41.3163 north, 79.3853 west.

08:28.670 --> 08:31.707
Here, see for yourself.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.800
- So you record sounds.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.979
Did you hear anything strange?
- Actually, yeah.

08:37.010 --> 08:40.241
At first I thought it was
a black-crowned night heron,

08:40.280 --> 08:42.942
but you know, it's too late
in the season for that.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.641
Here, you can listen.

08:50.890 --> 08:53.654
- I can't make heads or tails
of this. Got anything else?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.828
- Oh, yes. Four hours
of raw, unadulterated wind.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.237
That's the sound
of the island's soul.

09:00.270 --> 09:04.764
- Larry, do you know anyone on
this island who dislikes Frank?

09:04.810 --> 09:07.836
- I'd check_with the Schmidts.
They know hIm as well as anyone,

09:07.880 --> 09:10.007
and they do like to dish.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.218
Oh, my goodness!

09:15.250 --> 09:17.741
I'm such a big fan of your show!

09:17.790 --> 09:20.111
- Is this a bad time to mention
I don't have cable?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.788
- These guys are the hosts
of A Tale of Two Schmidty's,

09:22.830 --> 09:24.889
one of the top design shows
on The Accent Network.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.353
- Number one in our time slot,
three seasons and counting.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.698
But who keeps
track of that, right?

09:29.730 --> 09:31.994
- Do you mind if we ask a few
questions about your neighbour?

09:32.030 --> 09:34.931
- He's gonna pull through.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.938
- Oh, thank God. I just want
to get back to the days

09:36.970 --> 09:38.961
when the only thing I need to
worry about is his wardrobe.

09:39.010 --> 09:42.173
- Seriously, Hawaiian
shirts and striped pants?

09:42.210 --> 09:45.748
He makes Don Cherry look
like Oscar De La Renta.

09:45.780 --> 09:48.943
- Can you think of anyone

09:48.980 --> 09:51.380
who has a beef with Frank?
- Frank's harmless.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.116
Most people here just
pity him. I mean, come on.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.129
The man's spent a quarter
century procrastinating.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.924
Someone he's friendly with?

10:03.900 --> 10:06.835
- The last few months,
this gorgeous woman
started showing up.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.930
Blonde, wavy hair,
geek-chic glasses.

10:09.970 --> 10:11.858
- Vintage cat-eyes.
Very stylish.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.935
- Every couple of weeks,
like clockwork.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.936
Frank said it was his daughter.

10:15.980 --> 10:18.244
- The last time, it did not end
well. They had quite the row.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.943
- I'm not one to spread rumours.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.744
Oh, who am I kidding?
Of course I am.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.953
I heard "money,"
and then eventually

10:27.990 --> 10:30.083
he was screaming
at her to get out.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.951
- Sounded like Daddy was gonna
turn off the royalty tap.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.197
- Mr. Powers, you're Frank's
publisher. Did he mention any

10:40.240 --> 10:42.902
meetings with his daughter?

10:42.940 --> 10:45.033
- I'm more surprised to hear
Eliza's back in his life

10:45.070 --> 10:46.901
than that they're
fighting. Again.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.135
- She sued him

10:49.180 --> 10:51.205
for financial support years ago.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.969
Got accepted into
some fancy arts school

10:54.020 --> 10:56.944
and needed another
slice of the Garrison pie.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.914
- He only wrote one book.
How big can the pie be?

10:59.960 --> 11:03.225
- The Devil's Playground
is on practically every
university curriculum.

11:03.260 --> 11:05.979
It sells almost 100 000
copies a year.

11:06.030 --> 11:09.158
How is Frank, anyways?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.225
- Touch and go.
- What a tragedy.

11:11.270 --> 11:15.036
Is it selfish of me to wish that
he had left us one more book?

11:15.070 --> 11:17.834
- So Frank never did
write a follow-up to
The Devil's Playground?

11:17.870 --> 11:20.236
- He's been promising one for 20
years. Says he's deep into it,

11:20.280 --> 11:23.738
that it's the next Animal Farm.
I've stopped holding my breath.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.475
- Think that has
to do with Lovegrove?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.478
- It's Lovegrove, it's bourbon,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.943
it's fear of not living up
to himself. Itell him,

11:29.990 --> 11:32.982
it doesn't need to be good.
I'd publish his grocery list

11:33.020 --> 11:35.989
if he let me, it'd still sell a
million five in the first week.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.989
No, no! More red in the title,

11:39.030 --> 11:41.919
those words need to pop.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.929
- Could you at least wait
until the body's cold?

11:44.970 --> 11:46.961
- Look, I know it sounds
crazy, but I do this

11:47.000 --> 11:49.468
out of my love for his work.
Sales of Playground

11:49.500 --> 11:53.937
are down 20%. I'd be an idiot
not to capitalize on this media.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.403
- The publicity gets much bigger
if Frank doesn't make it.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.944
- I was nowhere_near
the island last night,

11:59.980 --> 12:02.915
if that's what you're asking.

12:02.950 --> 12:05.987
I love the man,
and what we're doing here,

12:06.020 --> 12:08.011
it makes me queasy.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.528
But nothing sells like tragedy.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.222
- Is that how you'd describe his
relationship with his daughter?

12:13.260 --> 12:15.751
- My correspondence with
Eliza starts and ends

12:15.800 --> 12:17.392
with _the annual Christmas card
I Sign from Fosset-Powers.

12:17.430 --> 12:20.035
- So I'm guessing
you have her address?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.128
- Closer. There you go.

12:26.170 --> 12:29.845
Yeah, just like that. Perfect.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.007
Great. Lift it?

12:34.820 --> 12:37.516
That's it. Thank you.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.380
Thank you.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.055
- Eliza, nice studio.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.989
We've heard so much about you.
You mind if we ask you
a few questions?

12:52.030 --> 12:54.294
- Sure. You guys interested
in nudes, or something

12:54.340 --> 12:57.400
more traditional?
I'd love to shoot you guys.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.830
- Oh, you're one of those.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.407
- A very special "one of those."
I'm interested in learning about
your visit with Frank yesterday.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.908
_- The one that ended
in a screaming match?
- There was no screaming match.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.180
- Two witnesses say otherwise.
- No, you don't understand.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.188
I believe someone
was screaming at him,

13:12.220 --> 13:14.586
but that someone wasn't me.
I haven't seen my father

13:14.620 --> 13:17.953
in 10 years.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.026
When Dad's book
became a best-seller,

13:20.060 --> 13:22.824
it was the happiest I'd ever
seen him. Our family lived

13:22.870 --> 13:24.963
in bliss for a week.
And then everything changed.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.332
- Senator Lovegrove
killed himself.

13:27.370 --> 13:29.338
- He was devastated.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.930
Suddenly his shining
diamond wasn't so shiny.

13:31.970 --> 13:36.077
So he started to drink... and
then he really started to drink.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.840
- Then he moved to the island.
- I was just a kid,

13:38.880 --> 13:40.871
but even I could see
he was trying to run away.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.014
He's done it his whole life.

13:44.050 --> 13:47.281
- My mother would take me there
for Christmas, or my birthday.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.982
But it became increasingly
clear we weren't wanted.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.555
So when my mother died,
I stayed away.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.956
I'm not even sure he knows
what I do for a living.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.093
- Must have been hard.
- "There's iron

13:57.130 --> 14:00.167
in the human soul."
My Dad wrote that.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.236
- It's one of
my favourite lines.

14:02.270 --> 14:06.559
- We talked to Elliot Powers.
He said you guys fought
over royalties?

14:06.610 --> 14:10.046
- That was 10 years ago,
the last time I saw my dad.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.208
I was unemployed and
trying to re-invent myself.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.548
- Looks like you succeeded.
- Look, if you're worried,

14:15.580 --> 14:18.242
I can prove where I was
last night. I did a session

14:18.290 --> 14:20.656
with a corporate client that ran
late. I'll get you their names.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.386
- We're looking for a woman

14:23.430 --> 14:25.557
who was hanging out
with your father

14:25.590 --> 14:28.627
for the last couple of months.
Blonde hair, glasses.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.924
Any idea who she is?
- There's a Frank Garrison

14:30.970 --> 14:33.234
fan club that's
run by the university.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.932
My dad maintains enough contact
to ensure a steady stream

14:35.970 --> 14:38.200
of nubile young writers
at his doorstep.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.073
I'd check there.
- Thanks, Eliza.

14:41.110 --> 14:43.044
You've been a big help.
- Thanks.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.605
- Cheers.

14:48.380 --> 14:52.043
- My father passed away last
year. Yours won't be
around forever.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.058
- I appreciate
what you're saying.

14:54.090 --> 14:57.082
But he's no father to me.
- Toronto General, room 303,

14:57.130 --> 14:59.325
if you change your mind.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.599
***
: OK, thanks.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.098
That was the hospital.
Frank's regaining consciousness.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.438
- Good news for "The Devil's
Playpals." That's the "group

15:10.470 --> 15:12.700
dedicated to celebrating
the work of Frank Garrison."

15:12.740 --> 15:15.072
- And by work,
they mean one book.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.078
_ - Consider it
his perfect season.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.044
Maybe it's all he had in him.
- I wouldn't know anything

15:19.080 --> 15:21.548
about that, because--

15:21.580 --> 15:24.140
- I hate him!

15:24.190 --> 15:27.079
- Liam. What kind
of kid gets a Suzuki

15:27.120 --> 15:29.452
Quadrunner for
his 14th birthday?

15:29.490 --> 15:31.720
We're working a case.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.422
- I'm multi-tasking.
Does he or does he not have

15:34.460 --> 15:36.599
the kind of face
you just want to punch?

15:36.630 --> 15:38.689
- He's 14.
- And surrounded by cute girls

15:38.730 --> 15:41.995
in every single picture.
- So you weren't surrounded

15:42.040 --> 15:44.167
by cute girls back in the day?
- Yeah, of course I was!

15:44.210 --> 15:46.007
But I didn't post
those pictures online.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.168
- There was no online.
And aren't you selling

15:49.210 --> 15:52.509
Jules short, here? You're always
talking about how great she is

15:52.550 --> 15:55.269
and now you're surprised
somebody likes her?

15:55.320 --> 15:58.187
You need to relax.
This Liam kid's a lot like you.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.085
- Yeah, that's
what I'm afraid of.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.749
- Look. 2016.

16:03.790 --> 16:07.055
- Wavy blonde hair, geek-chic
glasses. Ring any bells?

16:07.100 --> 16:10.092
- "Sarah Marsonet."

16:10.130 --> 16:13.668
Oh, social media, what did I do
before you came into my life?

16:13.700 --> 16:16.134
- This girl does
like her selfies.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.104
- She also likes dogs.
Looks like she's a dog-walker.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.608
- Maybe we can cruise by
and check her out.

16:20.640 --> 16:24.178
- If she's pretending to be
Frank's daughter, she's not
going to be easy to talk to.

16:24.210 --> 16:27.668
- If she walks dogs,
maybe she boards them too.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.574
- I like where
you're going with this.

16:29.620 --> 16:34.080
***

16:34.120 --> 16:37.226
- Hi. Thanks so much
for seeing us last-minute,

16:37.260 --> 16:39.228
but the airline
tickets are non-refundable.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.751
- That's what happens when
you cheap out on business class.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.189
- We wouldn't be here at all if
the dog-sitter somebody booked

16:44.230 --> 16:46.027
hadn't cancelled
at the last minute.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.038
- Oh, it's my fault that
Bodhi got the stomach flu?

16:48.070 --> 16:50.630
- It's OK. I think I have space.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.230
: Where'd you
get this thing?

16:53.280 --> 16:55.134
- Paid some kid 20 bucks
to rent him for an hour.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.740
- I have taught you well.
- Here is my rate card

16:57.780 --> 17:00.578
and references if you need them.
How long do you need your
dog boarded?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.714
_ - Two weeks_.
- Five days. I'm leavmg early

17:03.750 --> 17:06.810
for a business conference.

17:06.850 --> 17:09.648
Miu Miu's a little stickler _
when it comes to feng ShUl.

17:09.690 --> 17:12.181
- I understand totally.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.198
- Honey.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.494
- Oh. Hey, buddy.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.169
Yes... OK.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.168
- Hello, Miu Miu!
- Here.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.668
- We're going to get along
just fine, aren't we?

17:29.210 --> 17:31.770
Took a few years off,
came back for my Master's.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.142
It's harder than I remember.

17:34.180 --> 17:37.616
- I'm sure you'll
get through it. "There's
iron in the human soul."

17:39.890 --> 17:42.779
- Absolutely. Did you hear
there was a fire at his house

17:42.820 --> 17:45.527
the other night?
- Oh.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.097
How old is he?
- Uh...

17:48.130 --> 17:51.691
He's 10.
- Well, it's a she.

17:51.730 --> 17:53.698
Who are you?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.662
- The bigger question
is who are you?

17:55.700 --> 17:59.136
I remember this photo.
It ran in every newspaper

17:59.170 --> 18:02.401
after the discovery of
Christopher Lovegrove's body.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.840
That is Christopher Lovegrove.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.713
And that's his daughter,
Sarah Lovegrove.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.218
That's you.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.320
- I know what it looks like,
but it's not what you think.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.818
After Dad died, we took on
Mom's maiden name.

18:21.860 --> 18:26.160
There was a time when I wanted
Frank Garrison dead, I'll admit.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.204
Then I went to university and
his book was on the curriculum.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.175
I loved it, which
only made things worse.

18:33.210 --> 18:34.871
So one day, I sought him out.

18:37.510 --> 18:41.412
- I had to confront him.
Then when I finally saw him,

18:41.450 --> 18:44.385
he seemed so sad.

18:44.420 --> 18:48.379
I realized he was hurting
just as much as I was.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.684
And when I told him
I wanted to be a writer,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.686
he offered to help me.

18:52.730 --> 18:55.528
- The man responsible for your
father's death is your mentor?

18:55.560 --> 18:58.461
- Yes, he's a great teacher.
Frank believes technology

18:58.500 --> 19:01.367
kills the creative process.
He refuses to go on the cloud,

19:01.400 --> 19:04.403
he only writes on
a vintage Olympia SM3,

19:04.440 --> 19:06.931
and he keeps his
backups in a shoebox.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.234
Getting off the grid
really helped me focus

19:09.280 --> 19:12.169
and overcome my
social media addiction.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.474
- You're tweeting right now.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.580
- Witnesses saw you fighting
with Frank two days ago,

19:17.620 --> 19:19.747
shortly before the
house went up in flames.

19:19.790 --> 19:22.179
- I just finished a book.
Not a real book like Frank's,

19:22.220 --> 19:25.678
just an exercise. Frank got
upset that I didn't take
the process seriously.

19:25.730 --> 19:28.392
- And that's why
he was yelling at you?

19:28.430 --> 19:31.866
- He said some hurtful
things and I got angry.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.198
- Do you think it's possible
that Frank lit the fire himself?

19:34.240 --> 19:36.196
- No. This process
was healing for us both.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.663
It even inspired
Frank to write again.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.201
- Wait_ a sec. _
Frank's writing again?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.743
- Yeah.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.702
- The Schmidty's
went out of their way

19:45.750 --> 19:48.446
to point out that Frank wasn't
writing. Don't you think

19:48.480 --> 19:50.641
that's weird?

19:50.690 --> 19:53.352
- I think they knew. And if so,
everybody knew, which gives

19:53.390 --> 19:55.858
everyone on the island motive.
- Just because Frank's first

19:55.890 --> 19:57.926
novel exposed deadly secrets
doesn't mean his second will.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.951
- Let's go see
if he can tell us.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.225
- Angie Everett. This is my
colleague, Matt Shade.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.431
We're the private
investigators you hired.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.768
We know you're writing again.
We met with Sarah Lovegrove

20:10.810 --> 20:13.529
and she told us everything.
- She told us you were upset

20:13.580 --> 20:16.538
that she was downplaying her
talents. Is that why you
guys were fighting?

20:16.580 --> 20:19.003
- That's partially right. It had
more to do with a phone call

20:19.050 --> 20:21.575
that I received.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.747
- From my publisher,
Elliot Powers.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.714
He turned her book down
flat for publication.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.014
I was really pissed
'cause it was a fine work

20:29.060 --> 20:31.483
called Dancing in the Labyrinth.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.397
Unfortunately,
I took it out on Sarah.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.024
- Yeah, one bourbon,

20:37.060 --> 20:39.597
then another, then another,
and then I blacked out.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.565
The next thing I knew, I woke up
and I was smelling smoke.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.330
- Could be anyone.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.770
But I'd put my money
on the Schmidty's.

20:47.810 --> 20:50.745
They sent me a cease
and desist letter. They think

20:50.780 --> 20:54.272
I'm writing about them.
- So you are writing
a second book?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.015
- Yes. And it's all up
in smoke, just like that.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.542
- I don't trust computers.
Don't like them.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.888
- The fire inspector said the
blaze started in your study.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.956
Did you keep your work there?

21:03.990 --> 21:06.925
That I did it myself?
- No. But someone targeted you

21:06.960 --> 21:08.928
or your book and we're
trying to figure out which.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.020
If there were secrets in your
book that were worth
killing for,

21:12.070 --> 21:15.767
it would help to know them.
- I don't really get what's
going on here.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.802
You're just like Elliot,
like all the rest of them,

21:17.840 --> 21:19.899
just coming in here,
squeezing me like a lemon.

21:19.940 --> 21:23.603
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey. You hired
us. We're just here to help.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.642
- If I wanted help, I'd ask the
nurse to increase my morphine.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.648
Look, I know
exactly who you are.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.513
You're a long-time-
retired hockey player.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.984
And this investigation
is pathetic.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.779
with the Saskatoon Sasquatches!
- Hey. I was rehabbing

21:38.830 --> 21:40.855
a groin injury! And you
of all people should know

21:40.900 --> 21:42.629
not to judge a book
by its cover, old man!

21:42.660 --> 21:44.821
You know what?

21:44.870 --> 21:47.020
You don't qualify
as a magazine, either.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.959
You're like a faded flyer, put
in the bottom of a bird cage!

21:52.110 --> 21:54.806
- You'd be cranky too if someone
tried to burn your house down.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.933
- You're too close to this
to see the truth.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.847
Heroes are human, Angie.
They fall like the rest of us.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.440
- It's our job to pick him up.
- You still don't think

22:02.480 --> 22:05.483
he did this?
You said it yourself. People
hire P.I.'s all the time to take

22:05.520 --> 22:08.489
the stink off their own crimes.
- Why would he burn down
his own house?

22:08.520 --> 22:12.024
Frustration at
his unfinished novel

22:12.060 --> 22:14.051
- It's Mazhari.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.921
He checked the CCTV footage.
No personal watercrafts

22:16.960 --> 22:19.428
left the island
before or after the fire.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.438
- Which points
directly to Frank.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.859
- Frank did not light that fire.
An artist doesn't destroy

22:23.910 --> 22:27.801
his own work for money
he doesn't need. Look.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.104
You're either in or
you're out. What'll it be?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.074
- Hey, you know I got your back.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.977
- Good. Dress warm tomorrow,

22:35.020 --> 22:37.011
because we're going
back to the island.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.908
- I'm starting to
not like the island.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.951
***

22:45.190 --> 22:48.057
Morning, honey.
- Morning.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.056
I got dibs on the last muffin.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.729
- You already had one.
Rock

22:53.770 --> 22:56.694
- I'm blind.
- Yeah, I need the edge.

22:56.740 --> 23:00.779
Besides, there's nothing to eat
on the island this time of year.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.779
-_There's been a break
in the Garrison case,

23:03.810 --> 23:05.778
so I may be a little late.
You OK on your own?

23:05.810 --> 23:08.779
- Yeah, I can get home
solo. And I know how
to microwave a burrito.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.708
- I can always call
Gramps for backup.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.945
- No, it's his guys' week at the
cabin; I can't do that to him.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.584
Plus I'll just invite some
friends over, catch a movie.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.827
Maybe we'll start a meth lab.
- Alright, look.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.851
I'm sorry if I'm being
a little over-protective.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.529
I'm trying to get used to this
Monday-to-Friday parenting.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.926
- You're doing fine.
- OK, now I'm really nervous.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.097
- Don't be. It's true.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.509
Knock 'em dead, Veronica Mars.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.709
- He's cooler than he looks.

23:39.750 --> 23:43.538
Not that I can verify that.
- Well, I mean, how well
do you really know him?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.717
There's a lot of
hair product going on.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.980
And does he ever bring up his
family? His dad was involved

23:48.020 --> 23:50.989
in the whole hedge fund scandal.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.749
- Have you been
investigating Liam?

23:53.800 --> 23:56.724
- Well, it is my job.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.194
- Congratulations, Dad.
You're officially a dick.

24:05.140 --> 24:07.779
- You seem in a mood.
Something wrong?

24:07.810 --> 24:10.472
- I got into a fight with Jules.

24:10.510 --> 24:13.775
- Ah, she found out you
were stalking her boyfriend.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.970
- He's not her boyfriend.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.511
Anyway, I gently suggested

24:18.550 --> 24:20.859
that maybe she doesn't know
him as well as she thinks.

24:20.890 --> 24:23.984
- And she gently suggested
you take a flying leap.

24:24.030 --> 24:27.989
- I'm so glad my sub-par
parenting gives you joy.

24:28.030 --> 24:31.989
- You're new to the job, so I'll
let you in on a little secret:

24:32.030 --> 24:33.930
not everybody likes
P.I.'s, especially when

24:33.970 --> 24:35.961
they're snooping around
in people's lives.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.935
- This information would've
been helpful yesterday.

24:38.970 --> 24:41.837
- There's a reason we're
called "private" investigators.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.945
- The Schmidty's production

24:45.980 --> 24:48.244
office. They're confirming
that Will's in a meeting

24:48.280 --> 24:51.113
on the mainland. That means
the coast is half-clear.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.857
- I just can't believe
that two guys who can turn

24:53.890 --> 24:55.812
a vintage suitcase into an
ottoman could actually

24:55.860 --> 24:57.828
do something like this.
- All I know

24:57.860 --> 24:59.828
is they're the most
famous duo on the island,

24:59.860 --> 25:01.896
and if Frank was going
to air their dirty laundry,

25:01.930 --> 25:04.125
it could hit their
careers pretty hard.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.161
***

25:16.610 --> 25:20.148
- ** Electric love

25:20.180 --> 25:23.149
* Sonic sound

25:25.150 --> 25:29.712
* Rewin' it up
Now we're highway bound **

25:32.030 --> 25:35.193
- This guy can really move.
- As far as tails go,

25:35.230 --> 25:38.290
this one's easy. Make sure
Gil doesn't come back home
so I can poke around.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.992
- I gotta say, what you are
doing does not seem legal.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.099
- It's what WE are doing.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.029
Besides, "I heard
a noise and I got concerned."

25:46.070 --> 25:48.038
It's a quick in, quick out.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.139
[We're fine as long
as you don't screw it up.]

25:50.180 --> 25:53.240
- Who do you think
you're talking to?

26:01.090 --> 26:03.149
My first tail as a licensed P.I.

26:03.190 --> 26:06.978
- You should take this
seriously.

26:07.030 --> 26:09.794
- I should seriously
take a selfie?
- Whoa.

26:09.830 --> 26:12.094
I just found a box of bullets!

26:12.130 --> 26:14.166
They look like the ones
left on Frank's windowsill.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.760
There's 15 left
out of a box of 20.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.109
[Weren't there five in that
envelope Frank gave us

26:24.110 --> 26:26.999
- Yeah, I am.

26:27.050 --> 26:30.247
Problem is, Gil's not.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.253
Are you following me?

26:35.290 --> 26:37.622
- Improvise!

26:37.660 --> 26:42.290
- Gil! Wow, you're looking fit
these days. You work out?

26:42.330 --> 26:44.389
[The lady at the
store told me that]

26:44.430 --> 26:47.126
plaid is the new neutral,
but I'm really not sure.

26:47.170 --> 26:50.298
What do you think?

26:54.940 --> 26:58.068
- I doubt it...

26:58.110 --> 27:00.840
since the Schmidty's aren't gay.

27:03.150 --> 27:05.380
: If you guys want us
to keep this quiet,

27:05.420 --> 27:07.342
you're gonna have
to tell us the truth.

27:07.390 --> 27:10.723
- He's gay, I'm straight.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.126
- We were roommates
at de5ign school.

27:15.160 --> 27:18.061
A reality TV producer
liked our chemistry,

27:18.100 --> 27:20.125
and offered us a spot
on a cable show.

27:20.170 --> 27:23.162
- But he assumed we were lovers,
just because I like gossiping

27:23.200 --> 27:26.135
and waving my arms around.
- And let's face it:
because he's British.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.673
- Yeah, talk about
pandering to stereotypes.

27:28.710 --> 27:31.008
- We didn't want to lie,
but we were desperate back then.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.177
And now we're an Accent
Network institution

27:33.210 --> 27:35.178
with an international fan base,

27:35.220 --> 27:37.415
an eight figure net worth

27:37.450 --> 27:39.418
and a reputation for honesty.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.384
What would you do?

27:41.420 --> 27:44.127
- I'd be freaking out if a
novelist was about to expose me.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.220
- How'd you find out
about the book?
- Everybody knew.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.797
Whenever we'd ask Frank about
it, he'd get so defensive

27:49.830 --> 27:52.697
it could only mean one thing:
he was writing about us.

27:52.730 --> 27:55.233
- Frank once caught me
making out with my girlfriend

27:55.270 --> 27:57.238
in the morning before tai chi.

27:57.270 --> 27:59.135
I couldn't let the world
know I was straight.

27:59.170 --> 28:02.230
- Which is ironic,
considering 25 years ago

28:02.280 --> 28:05.101
Frank was responsible for
kicking a man out of the closet.

28:05.150 --> 28:08.210
- So you guys put the bullets
on Frank's windowsill.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.741
- Yeah, but we didn't
burn down his house.

28:10.790 --> 28:14.009
That kitchen, all that
natural light? We would never.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.779
- We were in Kensington Market,

28:16.820 --> 28:19.823
hanging with friends.
- By friends, he means our real

28:19.860 --> 28:22.852
lovers. It's complicated.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.868
- So you guys have
a pretty big secret.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.959
Anybody else on the island
that would be worried about

28:27.000 --> 28:30.265
a tell

28:30.300 --> 28:33.360
It's like Twin Peaks over here.

28:33.410 --> 28:35.401
- Well, if you want
your secret kept,

28:35.440 --> 28:38.443
you're gonna need
to do us a favour.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.119
How fast can you
spread a rumour?

28:45.120 --> 28:47.213
- Do you really think
this is gonna work?

28:47.250 --> 28:50.185
- If the Schmidts are as good at
gossip as they are at design,

28:50.220 --> 28:52.085
everyone on this island thinks
that Frank kept a backup

28:52.130 --> 28:55.224
of his second novel in his shed.
- So what, we sit here freezing

28:55.260 --> 28:57.194
_ our asses off
until somebody shows up?

28:57.230 --> 28:59.494
- Didn't you basically live
90% of your life on ice?

28:59.530 --> 29:01.794
- Yeah. Moving around.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.831
Staying warm.
Accomplishing something.

29:03.870 --> 29:06.236
- That's the thing about
stakeouts. They're 90% waiting,

29:06.270 --> 29:09.137
10% results.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.398
Less if you bring noisy snacks.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.146
- Hey. These babies
are full of magnesium.

29:14.180 --> 29:17.274
Magnesium enhances mental
acuity. You should try them.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.413
- I would, but apparently
it doesn't work.

29:19.450 --> 29:23.250
- Oh!

29:26.890 --> 29:28.858
Hey, honey.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.095
Yeah, I got your message
from earlier. I'm all set up.

29:31.130 --> 29:33.325
Pizza's on its way
and Ruby and Lynn are here.

29:33.370 --> 29:36.191
- Good, honey. Listen,
I'm glad you called.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.004
I wanted to talk about earlier.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.203
: I was wrong.
- I... I was wrong.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.243
Honey. I was wrong,
and I want to apologize.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.443
of a professional investigator.
Will you forgive me?

29:50.480 --> 29:54.109
- Exactly.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.186
- Apology accepted.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.484
So what movie
did you guys decide on?

29:59.530 --> 30:01.418
- Unfriended.
The described video

30:01.460 --> 30:03.553
is funnier than the dialogue.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.194
Classic.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.164
: [You guys don't want
any of this popcorn, right

30:08.200 --> 30:11.237
Is that a boy?

30:11.270 --> 30:14.273
]
- Uh, yeah, Liam's here too.

30:14.310 --> 30:17.473
- Honey, wait--

30:17.510 --> 30:19.478
Liam's there.
I'm calling my Dad.

30:19.510 --> 30:22.149
- Stop it. Your daughter
did that to piss you off.

30:22.180 --> 30:25.149
She's a good kid,
with good judgment.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.488
You just have to trust her.
Besides, Unfriended is not a bad

30:27.520 --> 30:30.921
little _horror flick.
- I thought it was a rom-com.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.191
- Did you know 55% of all horror
films are watched by women?

30:34.230 --> 30:37.119
Apparently horror films have
the same physiological effects

30:37.160 --> 30:40.425
on young girls
as sex. Cool, huh?

30:40.470 --> 30:44.008
- That's not nice!

31:22.180 --> 31:24.205
Hey.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.571
Now I know why you
love this book so much.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.245
It's not so much about the book;
it's about your dad.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.680
- He bought that for me
for my 14th birthday.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.656
Wasn't much of a reader,
but that book spoke to him.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.250
- Spoke to you too, apparently.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.518
- There was this
diner by our house.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.266
My dad used to take me there.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.098
We'd talk about The Devil's
Playground for hours.

31:50.140 --> 31:54.076
I miss that.

31:54.110 --> 31:56.032
- So that's why
you're re-reading it.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.174
You're trying to keep
your father alive.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.246
- Thanks, Sigmund.
Maybe I just like to read.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.283
The same book,
the same time, year after year?

32:06.720 --> 32:09.109
Maybe it's time to let go
of some of those memories,

32:09.160 --> 32:12.288
make some new ones.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.958
Maybe you'd learn something.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.956
- Maybe you could learn
something if you'd put down

32:17.000 --> 32:19.719
the sports biographies.
- The Agassi bio will teach you

32:19.770 --> 32:23.228
more about perseverance
than 100 therapists.

32:23.270 --> 32:27.058
It's soulful and funny
and it taught me

32:27.110 --> 32:29.670
I wasn't the only great athlete
to fall on hard times.

32:31.680 --> 32:35.116
- I had no idea...
that you were a great athlete.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.345
- And I had no idea

32:37.380 --> 32:40.611
that you talked in your sleep.
- Shut up.

32:40.650 --> 32:44.086
- Oh, the things
that you talked about...

32:44.130 --> 32:46.451
- Shut up.
- Oh, you have no idea.

32:55.300 --> 32:58.167
- It's Larry,

32:58.210 --> 33:00.030
the guy with the mic!
- Who just rocketed

33:00.070 --> 33:02.038
to number one
on our suspect list.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.072
- I was stretching my legs.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.271
- This is how this is gonna go
down. You're going to tell us

33:07.310 --> 33:10.177
what you're doing here or we're
going to go the cops with
everything we know.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.279
- Let's try this again. What's
the real reason you're here?

33:16.120 --> 33:19.248
(man and woman
grunting and moaning)

33:22.530 --> 33:24.725
- I think I've heard enough.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.795
- But they're
just getting started.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.334
- Hey.
- I already told you,

33:30.370 --> 33:32.304
I'm a legit composer.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.331
The sounds I record capture
the soul of the island.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.371
- Not the word
I would have used.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.401
- Do I sometimes hear something
that I shouldn't? Sure.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.577
Do I record it for my own
pleasure? Absolutely.

33:40.610 --> 33:43.170
Does that make me a criminal?
- es.

33:43.220 --> 33:45.142
: Oh.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.284
- We had drinks together,

33:48.320 --> 33:51.289
and one time, ONE TIME
I played him one of my 'scapes,

33:51.330 --> 33:54.151
with Shelley, that cute
waitress from Ellen's Cafe

33:54.200 --> 33:56.259
going at it with my neighbour
Bob... Why didn't I keep it

33:56.300 --> 34:00.225
to myself, right? I had to
know if Frank would spill.

34:00.270 --> 34:03.398
If the island found out,
I'd be a pariah. But I swear

34:03.440 --> 34:06.466
I didn't set the fire. I was on
the other side of the island.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.432
Those digital logs
are 100% legit.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.244
- This is some fancy equipment.
What does it do?

34:11.280 --> 34:14.147
- I can do anything with these
sounds. Stretch 'em, compress,

34:14.180 --> 34:16.216
add reverb.
- Can you filter out

34:16.250 --> 34:19.219
the background noise?

34:19.250 --> 34:21.286
- I want to have another listen
to that sound you recorded

34:21.320 --> 34:23.185
the night of the fire.
- Oh, yeah.

34:24.830 --> 34:29.119
Uh, here we are. 1:11 am.

34:37.570 --> 34:40.334
- Yeah, I'll try to compress it.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.237
Should be better.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.771
- What direction
did that come from?

34:45.810 --> 34:48.278
- My guess is Algonquin Beach.
- That makes no sense.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.209
I checked the CCTV cameras
and there was no record

34:51.250 --> 34:55.311
of any boat activity.
- That was no boat.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.557
I'm telling you,
it's a scuba tank.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.354
The sound of air being
released through a regulator.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.660
I used to scuba dive in
St. Lucia during the off-season.

35:05.700 --> 35:09.329
- OK. So someone
scuba-ed to Ward's Island

35:09.370 --> 35:12.237
underwat_er to avoid detection.
- Which puts our perp

35:12.270 --> 35:14.579
off-island. We've been
looking in the wrong place.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.703
- Maybe it's not about
the secrets in the book.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.470
Maybe it's about Frank.
He's hiding something.

35:19.510 --> 35:21.569
- Let's go find out what.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.488
- This might not have been
about your book at all, Frank.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.488
Of course it's about my book!

35:27.520 --> 35:30.318
I spent years
crafting every word.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.329
Obviously, somebody
out there is jealous!

35:33.360 --> 35:35.499
- Here's what we don't get.
There are a lot of people

35:35.530 --> 35:37.851
who gain from the
publication of the book,

35:37.900 --> 35:39.868
but almost no one who loses.

35:39.900 --> 35:43.461
Why destroy a book that's going
to make everyone a fortune?

35:43.500 --> 35:46.435
- Because there was
no book to destroy.

35:46.470 --> 35:49.177
That's why you get defensive
when we talk about it.

35:49.210 --> 35:51.599
That's why you
change the subject.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.278
There was no
second book, was there?

35:54.320 --> 35:57.346
- OK, it's writer's block.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.383
It's a very painful
disease, Miss Everett.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.354
It's debilitating.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.722
It's constipation of the soul.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.684
And I've had it for 25 years.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.857
- Because I'm Frank Garrison,

36:09.900 --> 36:13.222
because I am one of the world's
greatest liVing writers.

36:13.270 --> 36:15.534
Do you know what
it's like to try

36:15.570 --> 36:19.336
to live up to your former self?
- I'm pretty familiar with it.

36:19.370 --> 36:22.407
- If a man can't admit it
to himself he's a failure,

36:22.440 --> 36:24.340
how's he going to
admit it to his daughter?

36:24.380 --> 36:28.271
What's he going to tell her? And
I've let Eliza just drift away.

36:28.320 --> 36:32.279
You know, she's one of the top
photographers in this city.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.288
- So you do know what
she does for a living.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.312
- Course I do.
I've been collecting
photos of hers over the years.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.284
They are the most precious
things that I lost in that fire,

36:40.330 --> 36:42.924
I promise you that.
- And working with Sarah,

36:42.960 --> 36:45.360
it helped you heal.
- Sarah's another one

36:45.400 --> 36:48.267
of my failures. I really thought
that I could help her become

36:48.300 --> 36:50.336
a very successful writer.

36:50.370 --> 36:55.307
I really thought that she had
something that was fresh.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.331
Her book was like
a new Animal Farm.

36:59.510 --> 37:03.412
- That's what Elliot said
about Frank's new novel.

37:03.450 --> 37:05.941
Remember that framed picture
on the wall of his office?

37:05.990 --> 37:08.584
- His brag wall. There was
a photo of him scuba diving.

37:08.620 --> 37:11.680
Frank mentored her.
Her book would have his
fingerprints all over it.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.789
- That's what this whole thing
was about: Elliot trying to scam

37:13.830 --> 37:15.798
his way into a new
Frank Garrison book.

37:15.830 --> 37:18.298
- Because nothing
sells like tragedy.

37:18.330 --> 37:20.560
- Elliot is a bastard.
He's a total...

37:20.600 --> 37:22.488
: ...bastard!

37:24.470 --> 37:27.337
NURSE!

37:38.080 --> 37:40.048
- Ladies and gentlemen...

37:40.090 --> 37:43.014
I've just been told

37:43.060 --> 37:46.882
Frank Garrison has gone into a
coma and is unlikely to recover.

37:46.930 --> 37:49.694
I wish I was
sharing better news.

37:49.730 --> 37:52.824
But when the time comes,
Fosset—Powers will be there

37:52.870 --> 37:56.897
to celebrate Frank Garrison's
genius in a p05itive manner.

37:56.940 --> 38:00.398
Not only will we be re-issuing
The Devil's Playground,

38:00.440 --> 38:05.309
but Frank has left us
one final gift...

38:07.350 --> 38:09.409
...a new novel!

38:09.450 --> 38:11.839
I'll take your questions
one at a time. Yeah?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.552
- Is this new novel about
the ultimate betrayal

38:14.590 --> 38:17.457
of an old friend?
- No, it's a...

38:17.490 --> 38:19.720
It's an allegory,
set in a forest.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.728
A modern day Animal Farm.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.591
- Hey, I'd like to pitch you

38:23.630 --> 38:25.564
a killer idea that
we've been kicking around.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.068
Feel free to fill in the gaps,

38:28.100 --> 38:30.466
it is based on a true story.
- You're gonna love the villain.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.604
He's got big cojones
and a bow tie fetish.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.336
- Not really an
appropriate time for--

38:35.380 --> 38:38.008
- So he hatches a plan to kill
one of the greatest writers

38:38.040 --> 38:40.770
of our time by burning him
alive in his house.

38:40.810 --> 38:42.778
- I haven't been to
the island in months.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.380
That fire happened hours after--

38:45.420 --> 38:48.412
Clever idea, making it look like
someone on the island did it.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.678
Except for one small detail.
- That cave dive

38:50.720 --> 38:52.984
you did in Belize,
Elliot? Very impressive.

38:53.030 --> 38:55.123
- Your Divelogger watch.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.493
It uploads your data
to the cloud automatically:

38:58.530 --> 39:00.464
biometrics, GPS...

39:00.500 --> 39:02.536
- Places you within
a foot of your location

39:02.570 --> 39:05.437
and time stamps it. Like the
night of the fire, for instance.

39:05.470 --> 39:07.802
- You were wearing your dive
watch when you scuba-ed

39:07.840 --> 39:10.104
across the_harbour
to Algonqum Beach.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.108
- I don't have to listen
to any of this.

39:12.150 --> 39:15.142
- No, but they're gonna want to
to the very end, because
it's got everything:

39:15.180 --> 39:19.844
murder, greed and a twist
ending you never saw coming.

39:19.890 --> 39:23.382
- Ladies and gentlemen...

39:25.090 --> 39:27.388
My name is Frank Garrison

39:27.430 --> 39:30.422
and I am not in a coma,

39:30.460 --> 39:32.428
nor did I write this book,

39:32.470 --> 39:34.893
Dancing in the Labyrinth.
So allow me to introduce you

39:34.940 --> 39:38.034
to the real writer
of this magnificent novel.

39:38.070 --> 39:40.800
She's the daughter of a man
whose death I was responsible

39:40.840 --> 39:44.003
for years ago. This is...

39:44.040 --> 39:46.747
Sarah Loveg rove.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.442
Lovegrove?
- Yes, sir.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.146
- She's a Lovegrove, Elliot.

39:54.190 --> 39:57.717
- Wait, what--
- Everybody stay back, please.

40:10.540 --> 40:13.168
- Imagine if Elliot had known
Sarah's real identity.

40:13.210 --> 40:15.929
He could've saved himself
an attempted murder charge.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.074
Talk about sales.

40:19.110 --> 40:22.648
That's what you call...
dramatic irony.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.080
- There we go.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.111
The remaining balance.

40:27.150 --> 40:29.687
Worth every penny. Thank you.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.587
- My daughter's offered a bed.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.793
I'm going to take her up on it.
We got a lot of catching
up to do.

40:35.830 --> 40:37.798
- You think when
this is all done,

40:37.830 --> 40:41.596
you'll get back to a typewriter?
- Ooh, now. Baby steps here.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.596
I don't know.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.608
What I'm actually
thinking of doing

40:45.640 --> 40:48.165
is something
completely different.

40:48.210 --> 40:50.531
Being a father.

40:50.580 --> 40:53.674
We'll see. Come to
think of it, Mr. Shade,

40:53.710 --> 40:55.746
you know, you've managed to

40:55.780 --> 40:58.112
get yourself a pretty
good second act.

40:58.150 --> 41:01.779
Maybe I can too.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.811
***

41:14.970 --> 41:18.758
- ** You remind me
of everything I love *

41:22.040 --> 41:25.806
* Yeah, you remind me
of everything I love *

41:29.050 --> 41:31.712
* The straw underneath
this blanket *

41:31.750 --> 41:35.015
* And the stars
that catch your eyes *

41:35.060 --> 41:39.884
* And the moment when
you are closer by my Side *

41:43.330 --> 41:48.267
* You remind me
of everything I love *

41:48.300 --> 41:51.565
: I got you something.

41:53.870 --> 41:56.134
- Here.

41:58.140 --> 42:01.007
- The Devil's Playground.
- I haven't read it myself,

42:01.050 --> 42:03.814
so I'm gonna give the
non-Braille version a shot,

42:03.850 --> 42:07.217
and when we're finished, we can
debrief over a cup of coffee.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.184
- Deal.
- OK.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.188
- That's pretty cool, sir.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.628
- Thank you, Liam.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.992
: Text from Ruby.

42:18.030 --> 42:20.624
- She's hosting
the next movie night

42:20.670 --> 42:23.161
and this is only
her 10th text. Here.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.259
Keep an eye on him.
I'm gonna make a quick call.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.933
Hey, Ruby, it's Jules.
Yeah, I'm on the ferry

42:29.980 --> 42:33.199
with my dad and Liam.
I know, crazy, right?

42:33.250 --> 42:37.209
- I'm glad you could
join us today, Liam.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.684
I figured maybe you'd be off
dirt-biking with your buddies.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.359
- Little late in
the year for that, sir.

42:42.390 --> 42:44.255
- Right.
- I don't know. Ijust, um...

42:44.290 --> 42:46.281
I like hanging out with Jules.

42:46.330 --> 42:49.629
- She's cool.

42:49.660 --> 42:52.060
You know? Interesting. Funny.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.137
Surprising.

42:55.170 --> 42:57.263
And she's the only girl I know

42:57.300 --> 42:59.359
that really doesn't
just care about my looks.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.970
You know?

43:05.750 --> 43:08.275
- Do you ever read any
sports biographies, Liam?

43:08.310 --> 43:12.849
- * You remind me
of everything I love *

43:15.990 --> 43:19.881
* Yeah, you remind me
of everything I love *

43:23.000 --> 43:26.163
* A smile_that's
so much bigger *

43:26.200 --> 43:29.658
* Than the smiles
that I have seen *

43:29.700 --> 43:33.238
* And it makes me realize

43:33.270 --> 43:37.878
* That there is so much more
than what I've seen **
