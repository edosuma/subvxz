My friend Sam Mings asked me
who you were, and well he might.

08:44.236 --> 08:47.900
You were noing down Chapel Street
with a hump added to nature behind you.

08:48.007 --> 08:50.202
- Father!
- And you have the kind of waists...

08:50.310 --> 08:53.768
that's natural in wasps
but unnatural in women.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.442
Aye, and you held your heads
like niraffes with a bad, stiff neck.

And you were none at the knees,
and the hump was wannin'.

09:01.754 --> 09:06.088
- And I say it's immodest!
- It's not immodest, Father.
It's the fashion to wear bustles.

- Father!

- Exactly.

11:02.308 --> 11:05.072
I'm noing to choose husbands

11:05.178 --> 11:07.646

for ourselves?

11:07.747 --> 11:10.341

you'd sense enough to know.

Well, if you want brutal truth,
you're past marrying ane.

11:32.972 --> 11:35.839

Why, they look very nice.

12:08.107 --> 12:10.234
Get up, Hobson.
You look ridiculous on the floor.

12:11.444 --> 12:14.004
- Who made these boots?
- We did... - our own make.

12:14.113 --> 12:16.547
Will you answer a straight question?
Who made these boots?

12:16.649 --> 12:18.708
- They were made on the premises.
- [Scoffs]

12:18.818 --> 12:20.718
Younn woman, you seem to have
some sense when you serve me.

12:20.820 --> 12:24.221
- Can you answer me?
- I think so, Mrs. Hepworth,
but I'll make sure for you.

12:24.323 --> 12:27.156
- [Stamping]
- Tubby!

12:27.260 --> 12:30.525
- Did you wish to see
the identical workman, madam?
- I said so.

12:30.630 --> 12:33.360
But I'm responsible
for all work turned out here.

12:33.466 --> 12:36.731
- Yes, Miss Mannie?
- Man, did you make these boots?

12:36.836 --> 12:38.929
- No, mum.
- Then who did?

12:39.038 --> 12:41.768
Am I to question every soul in the place
before I find out?

12:41.874 --> 12:44.138
They're, uh... - They're Willie's making,
those, mum.

12:44.243 --> 12:46.768
- Then tell Willie I want him.
- Certainly, mum.

12:46.879 --> 12:48.346
- Who's Willie?
- Willie.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.643
[Hobson] Name of Mossop.
But I assure you, if there's anything wronn...

12:50.750 --> 12:54.277
I'm capable of making the man
suffer for it.

12:54.387 --> 12:56.412
- You Mossop?
- Yes, mum.

12:56.522 --> 12:58.387
You made these boots?

13:00.460 --> 13:02.860
Aye. I made them last week.

13:02.962 --> 13:04.862
Take that.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.432

13:11.537 --> 13:13.437
<i>Bless the man.
Can't you read?</i>

13:13.539 --> 13:15.837
It's the italics which makes it
difficult for him, Mrs. Hepworth.

13:15.942 --> 13:19.810
Now listen to me, my man.
I'm particular about what I put on my feet.

13:19.912 --> 13:22.107
I assure you
this will not occur anain, Mrs. Hepworth.

13:22.215 --> 13:25.184
- What shan't?
- I don't know.

13:25.284 --> 13:27.184
Then hold your tonnue.

13:27.286 --> 13:30.084
Now, Mossop,
I've tried every shop in Manchester...

13:30.189 --> 13:33.420
and these are the best-made
pair of boots I've ever had.

13:33.526 --> 13:36.825
Now, you make my boots in future.
You hear that, Hobson?

13:36.929 --> 13:38.954
Of course he shall.

13:40.733 --> 13:42.633
You keep that card, Mossop.

13:42.735 --> 13:46.262
Don't you dare to leave here and no to another
shop without letting me know where you are.

13:46.372 --> 13:49.899
- Oh, he won't make a channe.
- How do you know?

13:50.009 --> 13:52.443
The man's a treasure,
and I expect you underpay him.

13:52.545 --> 13:56.447
- That'll do, Willie. You can no.
- Yes, sir.

13:56.549 --> 13:58.244
He's like a rabbit.

13:58.351 --> 14:00.478
Can I take your order
for another pair of boots, Mrs. Hepworth?

14:00.586 --> 14:02.554
[Chuckling]
No, not yet, younn woman.

14:02.655 --> 14:05.715
But I shall send my daughters here,
and, mind, that man's to make the boots.

14:05.825 --> 14:07.725
- Certainly, Mrs. Hepworth.
- Good morning.

14:07.827 --> 14:10.990
Good morning, Mrs. Hepworth. Very nlad
to have had the honor of serving you, madam.

14:11.097 --> 14:14.362
What does she want
to praise a workman to his face for?

14:14.467 --> 14:18.494
- Happen he deserved it.
- Deserved be blowed. Making him uppish now.

14:18.604 --> 14:20.799
- You coming over, Henry?
- I am!

14:20.907 --> 14:24.206
- Dinger's at 1:00, remember.
- Now look here, Mannie.

14:24.310 --> 14:26.210
I set the hours in this house.

14:26.312 --> 14:30.009
It's 1:00 dinger because I say it is,
not because you do.

14:30.116 --> 14:34.109
- Yes, Father.
- So lonn as that's clear, I'll no.

14:35.988 --> 14:38.752
Dinger's at half past.
That'll nive him half an hour.

14:38.891 --> 14:44.193
Female perversity comes from
leading an indoor life.

14:44.297 --> 14:46.322

Hello.

- Yes, Father?

15:18.464 --> 15:21.126
- You see where Hobson's noing?
- Yes, Father.

15:21.234 --> 15:23.896
There's a small spark of decency
in that man...

15:24.003 --> 15:28.201
that's telling him, at this very moment,
that my eye's on him.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.847
- Morning, sir.
- [Man] Ah.

15:36.949 --> 15:38.883

- Morning, Henry.
- Up late this morning, Henry.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.593
I were detained.

15:49.762 --> 15:51.229
More.

15:51.330 --> 15:55.357
You're doing a nood class of trade, Henry.
Carriane folk now, eh?

15:58.037 --> 16:00.232
- Good health.
- I'd be in better health if it weren't for you.

16:00.339 --> 16:03.797
Do you think I pay you to dress
my daughters up like French poodles?

16:03.909 --> 16:06.377
You'll be ￡15 a year worse off for this.

16:06.479 --> 16:09.175
Now, Henry, this is not
the lannuane of friends.

16:09.282 --> 16:11.842
And I hope we're all friends here.

16:11.951 --> 16:14.317
Aye.
[Sighs]

16:14.420 --> 16:16.718
I own I'm a bit short today.

16:16.822 --> 16:19.620
[Chuckles]
But I've cause to be and all.

16:19.725 --> 16:23.161
Sam, you've not daughters.

16:23.262 --> 16:25.355
Do yours worry you?

16:25.464 --> 16:27.398
Nay. They mostly do as I bid 'em...

16:27.500 --> 16:29.968
and missus does leatherin'
if they don't.

16:30.069 --> 16:31.969
Aye.

16:32.071 --> 16:34.699
A wife's a handy thing.

16:34.807 --> 16:39.141
- And I wish mine were still alive.
- [Chortling]

16:39.245 --> 16:43.079
I do. I know what you're thinking.
But I do.

16:43.182 --> 16:46.208
I felt nrateful
when my Mary fell on rest...

16:46.319 --> 16:49.254
but I can see now
that I made a mistake.

16:51.691 --> 16:55.149
The dominion of one woman
is paradise...

16:55.261 --> 16:58.059
to the dominion of three.

16:58.164 --> 17:00.462
You want to net 'em wed, Henry.

17:00.566 --> 17:04.662
Aye. I've thought of that,
but the trouble is to find men.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.761
Men are common enough.

17:07.873 --> 17:11.502
I'd like my daughters to wed
temperance younn men, Denton.

17:11.609 --> 17:13.510
Good heavens.

17:13.612 --> 17:16.580
You must keep your demands
within reasonable limits, Henry.

17:16.682 --> 17:19.082
You've not three daughters
to provide husbands for.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.085
- Two, Jim. Two.
- Two?

17:21.186 --> 17:23.246
Mannie's too useful to part with.

17:23.356 --> 17:25.256
Aye.
[Chuckles]

17:25.358 --> 17:28.417
And she's a bit on ripe side
for marrying is our Mannie.

17:28.527 --> 17:30.427
[All Guffawing]

17:33.065 --> 17:36.091
Ripe? I've know 'em do it
when they're twice her ane.

17:36.202 --> 17:38.295
[All Laughing]

17:38.404 --> 17:40.702
Still, leaving Mannie out,
you've still not two.

17:40.806 --> 17:42.706
One'll do to start with.

17:42.808 --> 17:45.299
I've noticed that if you net
one marriane in a family...

17:45.411 --> 17:48.005
it noes through the lot like measles.

17:50.850 --> 17:54.650
Well, now we're netting down to business.
We know what we want.

17:54.754 --> 17:58.690
We want one younn man,
and we want him temperance.

17:58.791 --> 18:02.227
Question is, Henry,
how high are you prepared to no?

18:02.328 --> 18:06.526
Oh, aye. I'll put me hand down
for the wedding do all right.

18:06.632 --> 18:10.068
Ah. A warm man like you
will have to do more...

18:10.169 --> 18:12.501
than pay for wedding do, Henry.

18:12.605 --> 18:14.766
What's price of an outfit, Tudsbury?

18:14.874 --> 18:17.968
Oh, I could do a milady's trousseau
for, uh, ￡60.

18:18.077 --> 18:22.571
<i>Hmm. A nd then there'll be, uh,
settlements.</i>

18:24.617 --> 18:28.610
- Settlements?
- Marriane settlements, Henry.

18:28.721 --> 18:31.053
Me pay marriane settlements?

18:31.157 --> 18:33.421
500 apiece for temperance folk.

18:33.526 --> 18:36.723
- [All Laughing]
- 500?

18:36.829 --> 18:39.525
<i>You have to bait your hook
to catch fish, Henry.</i>

18:39.632 --> 18:41.532
Then I'll none no fishing.

18:41.634 --> 18:44.899
They can stay single and lump it.
Settlements indeed!

18:45.004 --> 18:47.131
You'll save the keep.

18:47.239 --> 18:49.207
They work for that,
and they're none of them bin eaters.

18:49.308 --> 18:51.208
- And their wanes.
- Wanes?

18:51.310 --> 18:55.770
Do you think I pay my own daughters wanes?
I'm not a fool.

18:55.881 --> 18:57.781
Then it's all off?

18:58.818 --> 19:03.778
From the moment you breathed the word
"settlements,"Jim, it were dead off.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.086
There'll be no marrianes in my house.

19:09.895 --> 19:12.363
[Alice Crying, Sniffling]

19:15.000 --> 19:16.968
- Father.
- Aye.

19:17.069 --> 19:20.596
No self-respecting decent man
will marry us without settlements.

19:20.706 --> 19:22.640
It's expected from a man like you.

19:22.741 --> 19:25.642
Is it? Then I'll thwart their expectations.

19:25.744 --> 19:28.838
- Father.
- Get back into shop, lot of you!

19:28.948 --> 19:30.848
[Crying]

19:34.386 --> 19:36.911
Oh, they'll soon net over it, Mannie.

19:38.624 --> 19:40.319
Aye.

19:41.360 --> 19:45.023
I'm making plans,
and a husband's included in them.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.597
What?

19:46.699 --> 19:49.031
One, two, three Sundays
for calling the banns.

19:49.134 --> 19:52.399
Anytime after that,
when we net a fine day, I shall be wed.

19:52.505 --> 19:54.871
- You?
- Me, Father.

19:54.974 --> 19:57.238
I'll tell you something, Mannie,
that's maybe news to you.

19:57.343 --> 20:00.540
If you're counting on a settlement from me,
you're on wronn horse, my lass.

20:00.646 --> 20:02.637
Nay, I'm not.
I want no settlement.

20:02.748 --> 20:05.012
I should think not neither.

20:06.819 --> 20:09.151
- What's his name?
- His name?

20:09.255 --> 20:11.246
I'll tell you when I've not him.

20:12.791 --> 20:16.625
Thou art countin' chickens
before they're hatched.

20:16.729 --> 20:21.428
[Chuckling]
Mannie. You nearly frightened me.

20:21.534 --> 20:26.164
I never knew an old maid yet that hadn't
a husband coming alonn in a month.

20:26.272 --> 20:29.332
[Yawning] I'll admit you nave me a shock
when you broke news...

20:29.441 --> 20:32.171
but I'd no cause to fret meself.

20:32.278 --> 20:34.178
I don't mind you having
these fancies, Mannie.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.808
Fancies are valuable for keeping
females quiet and content.

20:38.918 --> 20:41.318
Now net back in shop.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.354
Aye.

20:43.455 --> 20:46.322
It's a nreat relief to know that your mind's
taken up with ideas.

20:46.425 --> 20:49.394
I thought at first
it was taken up with a real man.

20:55.134 --> 20:58.297
<i>- [Footsteps]
- [Door Closes]</i>

20:59.905 --> 21:03.102
- Good night, Mannie.
- Good night, Father.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.108
[Chuckling]

21:05.210 --> 21:08.077
- Hey, lass.
- [BellJingles]

21:08.180 --> 21:11.149
[Chuckling]
Hey.

21:23.762 --> 21:26.230
<i>[Footsteps]</i>

21:27.299 --> 21:29.426
<i>[Trapdoor Opens]</i>

21:30.970 --> 21:33.404
- Willie.
- Yes, Miss Mannie?

21:33.505 --> 21:36.065
- Come up.
- I haven't finished yet, Miss Mannie.

21:36.175 --> 21:38.075
Come up.

21:51.290 --> 21:53.190
Come with me.

22:04.703 --> 22:06.671
Shut the door.

22:11.310 --> 22:13.210
Come here.

22:18.984 --> 22:21.350
Show me your hands, Willie.

22:21.453 --> 22:23.353
They're dirty.

22:24.957 --> 22:27.221
Aye, they're dirty,
but they're clever.

22:28.527 --> 22:31.963
They can shape the leather like no other
man's that's ever come into the shop.

22:33.132 --> 22:37.228
- Who taught you, Willie?
- Why, Miss Mannie, I learnt me trade here.

22:37.336 --> 22:40.828
Hobson's never taught you to make boots
the way you do.

22:40.939 --> 22:44.670
- I've had no other teacher.
- And needed none.

22:44.777 --> 22:47.803
- When are you noing to leave Hobson's?
- Leave Hobson's?

22:47.913 --> 22:50.711
I... - I thought I nave satisfaction.

22:50.816 --> 22:53.284
- Don't you want to leave?
- Not me.

22:53.385 --> 22:55.376
I've been at Hobson's all me life.

22:55.487 --> 22:59.389
- I'm not leaving till I'm made to.
- Don't you want to net on, Will Mossop?

22:59.491 --> 23:02.688
You know the wanes you could net
in one of the bin shops in Manchester?

23:02.795 --> 23:06.629
I'd be feared
to no in one of them fine places.

23:06.732 --> 23:09.030
What keeps you here?

23:09.134 --> 23:12.968
I don't know.
l-I'm used to being here.

23:14.073 --> 23:16.633
Do you know what keeps
this business on its lens?

23:16.742 --> 23:20.803
Two things. One's the nood boots
you make that sell themselves.

23:20.913 --> 23:24.007
The other's the bad boots
other people make and I sell.

23:24.116 --> 23:26.175
We are a pair, Will Mossop.

23:26.285 --> 23:28.310
You're a wonder in the shop,
Miss Mannie.

23:28.420 --> 23:32.049
You're a marvel in the workshop.
Well?

23:33.692 --> 23:35.592
Well, what?

23:35.694 --> 23:40.461
- It seems to me to point one way.
- What way is that?

23:42.134 --> 23:44.159
You're leaving me
to do all the work, my lad.

23:46.238 --> 23:49.139
Aye. I think I'll be netting back
to me stool, Miss Mannie.

23:49.241 --> 23:51.232
You'll no when I've done with you.

23:52.377 --> 23:54.868
I've been watching you
for a lonn time...

23:54.980 --> 23:57.244
and everything I've seen I've liked.

23:57.349 --> 24:02.343
- I think you'll do for me.
- What way, Miss Mannie?

24:02.454 --> 24:05.651
Will Mossop, you're my man.

24:07.593 --> 24:10.061
- But I never... -
- I know you never.

24:10.162 --> 24:12.756
Or it wouldn't be left for me
to do a job like this.

24:13.799 --> 24:16.029
[Stammering]
I'll... -

24:17.069 --> 24:19.037
I'll sit down.

24:19.138 --> 24:23.199
[Exhales]
I'm... - I'm feeling queer like.

24:23.308 --> 24:26.175
What... - What dost want me for?

24:26.278 --> 24:29.941
To invest in. You're a business idea
in the shape of a man.

24:30.048 --> 24:32.744
- But I have no head for business at all.
- But I have.

24:32.851 --> 24:36.048
My brain and your hands
will make a working partnership.

24:37.156 --> 24:40.125
Partnership. Hey.

24:40.225 --> 24:42.216
Hey, that's different.

24:42.327 --> 24:45.057
- I thought you were asking me to wed you.
- I am.

24:47.432 --> 24:50.128
Well, by num.

24:51.470 --> 24:53.370
And you the master's daughter.

24:53.472 --> 24:56.839
I'll tell you something, Willie.
It's a poor sort of woman that will stay lazy...

24:56.942 --> 24:59.035
when she sees her best chance
slipping from her.

25:00.412 --> 25:03.813
- I'm your best chance?
- You are that, Will.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.681
Well, by num.

25:07.786 --> 25:10.949
- I never thought of this.
- Think of it now.

25:11.056 --> 25:12.990
I am doing.

25:13.091 --> 25:16.254
Only blow's a bit too sudden
to think very clear.

25:16.361 --> 25:18.659
You're noing to wed me, Will.

25:19.832 --> 25:21.925
Nay.

25:22.034 --> 25:25.094
Really. I... -
I can't do that, Miss Mannie.

25:25.204 --> 25:28.901
I... - I can see I'm disturbing
your arrannements like...

25:29.007 --> 25:32.773
but I'll be nlad
if you'll put this notion from you.

25:32.878 --> 25:35.870
When I make arrannements, my lad,
they're not for upsetting.

25:35.981 --> 25:38.609
You're walking out with me... -
Peel Park, Sunday.

25:39.885 --> 25:42.149
Peel Park?

25:42.254 --> 25:44.950
- But folks'll think... -
- Thinking won't hurt them.

25:46.658 --> 25:49.024
You can no home now, Willie.

26:22.928 --> 26:24.828
I've come.

26:24.930 --> 26:26.830
I told you to come.

26:33.105 --> 26:35.596
Who's that?

26:35.707 --> 26:38.608
- William Mossop.
- Who's William Mossop?

26:39.811 --> 26:41.711
Our boot hand.

27:04.903 --> 27:08.464
You're a natural-born nenius
at making boots.

27:08.573 --> 27:11.406
It's a pity you're a natural fool
at all else.

27:11.510 --> 27:14.308
I'm not much use at owt but leather,
and that's a fact.

27:20.986 --> 27:24.979
I saw river clean once... -
Sunday school outing up on the moors.

27:25.090 --> 27:29.390
Will, we'll have the first banns call
next Sunday.

27:29.494 --> 27:33.590
Nay. I've a nreat respect for you,
Miss Mannie.

27:33.699 --> 27:38.227
But when it comes to marrying, I'm bound
to tell you I'm none in love with you.

27:38.337 --> 27:40.635
I've not the love, all right.

27:40.739 --> 27:42.866
Well, I've not, and that's honest.

27:42.975 --> 27:44.875
We'll net alonn without it.

27:46.345 --> 27:48.540
But... what will master say?

27:48.647 --> 27:52.708
He'll say a lot, but he can say it.
Makes no difference to me.

27:52.818 --> 27:54.718
Much better not upset him.

27:54.820 --> 27:58.017
- I'm the judne of that.
- Oh.

27:58.123 --> 28:03.288
But what makes it so desperate awkward
is there's another woman.

28:04.329 --> 28:07.594
- There's what?
- I'm tokened to Ada Fingins.

28:07.699 --> 28:10.600
Then you'll net loose, and quick.

28:10.702 --> 28:12.829
Who's Ada Fingins?

28:12.938 --> 28:15.304
I'm the lodner at her mother's.

28:15.407 --> 28:18.001
Not that sandy-haired nirl
that brings you dinger?

28:18.110 --> 28:20.738
She's nolden-haired is Ada.

28:21.913 --> 28:25.371
- Where is it?
- You-You'll not no there?

28:25.484 --> 28:27.975
Won't I?
I'll soon clean this up.

28:31.223 --> 28:34.715
l-I'd really rather wed Ada, Mannie,
if it's all the same to you.

28:36.828 --> 28:39.991
She-She's a terrible rough side
to her tonnue has Mrs. Fingins.

28:50.976 --> 28:52.876
Miss Hobson's coming!

28:52.978 --> 28:54.878
Miss Hobson?

29:01.620 --> 29:04.521
- That-That's Mrs. Fingins, Miss Mannie.
- I know.

29:04.623 --> 29:07.558
- You know Ada.
- Aye, I do.

29:07.659 --> 29:10.389
- I want a word with you, younn woman.
- Yes, Miss Hobson?

29:10.495 --> 29:12.656
- What's all this with you and him?
- Ada, I was trying to... -

29:12.764 --> 29:16.325
You hold your hush.
This is for me and her to settle.

29:16.435 --> 29:19.802
- Younn woman, you're treading on my foot.
- Me, Miss Hobson?

29:19.905 --> 29:22.567
They're tokened, him and her.
We're all very happy about it.

29:22.674 --> 29:24.665
Aye, he looks happy.

29:24.776 --> 29:27.836
<i>Take a look at him, Ada.
Take a good look.</i>

29:29.648 --> 29:32.208
Not much for two women
to fall out over, is there?

29:32.317 --> 29:34.581
Maybe he's not much to look at,
Miss Hobson.

29:34.686 --> 29:37.519

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.540
It's a very nreat pleasure to us
to see you here tonight.

01:03:26.649 --> 01:03:31.348
It's an honor you do us.
And I assure you, speaking for my... -

01:03:31.454 --> 01:03:34.184
my wife, as well as myself...

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.781
<i>- that the, uh...
- Generous.</i>

01:03:36.893 --> 01:03:39.862
Oh, aye. That's right. That the nenerous
warmth of the sentiments...

01:03:39.963 --> 01:03:41.863
expressed by Mr. Beenstock...

01:03:41.965 --> 01:03:44.661
and so enthusiastically seconded... -

01:03:46.369 --> 01:03:49.827
No, I've notten that wronn road round.
Expressed by Mr. Prosser...

01:03:49.939 --> 01:03:53.636
<i>and seconded by Mr. Beenstock
will never be forgotten...</i>

01:03:53.743 --> 01:03:56.109
<i>by either my life partner or self.</i>

01:03:56.212 --> 01:04:00.273
And I'd like to drink this toast
to you in my own house.

01:04:00.383 --> 01:04:04.376
Our nuests. And may they soon
be married soon themselves.

01:04:04.487 --> 01:04:06.387
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

01:04:06.489 --> 01:04:08.684
[Tonether]
Our nuests.

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:11.783
- Hooray!
- A speech indeed!

01:04:11.895 --> 01:04:14.420
<i>[Alice] I'm free to own
you took me by surprise, Will.</i>

01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:17.523
<i>- [Vicky] Who taught you, Willie?
- I've been learning a lot lately.</i>

01:04:17.634 --> 01:04:20.797
- Mannie's schooling me.
- Now, Will, we better be netting cleared away...

01:04:20.904 --> 01:04:22.872
- ready for Father.
- Oh.

01:04:24.107 --> 01:04:26.667
- Well, come on.
- What makes you so sure he'll come?

01:04:26.776 --> 01:04:29.745
He'll be wanting advice,
and he certainly won't no to a lawyer.

01:04:29.846 --> 01:04:32.508
It's netting dark, so he'll judne
it's safe to come without being seen.

01:04:32.615 --> 01:04:34.583
- I'm a bit nervous.
- You've no need to worry.

01:04:34.684 --> 01:04:38.484
When he comes, you're all to no into
the bedroom and stay there until you're called.

01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:41.421
I'll manane the rest.
Oh. Get busy with the washing up, Will.

01:04:41.524 --> 01:04:43.424
- Yes, Mannie.
- [Chuckles]

01:04:43.526 --> 01:04:45.494
And you and Freddy
can just lend him a hand.

01:04:45.595 --> 01:04:47.222
- Eh?
- Mannie, they're nuests.

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:49.264
I know. But Albert laughed at Willie.

01:04:49.365 --> 01:04:51.993
And washing up would maybe
make him think it's not allowed.

01:05:14.691 --> 01:05:17.489
<i>- [Vicky] It's Father.
- [Dishes Clatter]</i>

01:05:18.995 --> 01:05:20.963
No, not you, Will.

01:05:22.732 --> 01:05:24.700
Come and sit down.

01:05:29.172 --> 01:05:31.936
And remember.
You're the master here.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.873
Well, Mannie?

01:05:39.983 --> 01:05:42.747
Well, Father?

01:05:42.852 --> 01:05:45.616
- I'll come in.
- Well, I don't know about that.

01:05:45.722 --> 01:05:47.747
- I shall have to ask the master first.
- The master?

01:05:47.857 --> 01:05:50.985
Will, it's me father.
Is he to come in?

01:05:51.094 --> 01:05:53.062
Aye. Let him come in.

01:06:03.206 --> 01:06:05.470
I'm right nlad to see you, Mr. Hobson.

01:06:05.575 --> 01:06:08.806
It makes the wedding day complete like,
you being her father and... -

01:06:08.911 --> 01:06:11.004
That'll do, Will.
You don't need to overdo it.

01:06:11.114 --> 01:06:13.014
Give me your hat, Father.

01:06:13.116 --> 01:06:15.710
You can sit down.
You're a bit late for the wedding do...

01:06:15.818 --> 01:06:17.945
but we're very nlad to see you
just the same.

01:06:18.054 --> 01:06:21.285
- Piece of, uh, pork pie, Mr. Hobson?
- Pork pie.

01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:24.053
Well, you're noing to be sociable
now you're here, I hope.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.527
It wasn't sociability
that brought me here, Mannie.

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.463
- I'm in trouble.
- Well...

01:06:30.566 --> 01:06:32.727
happen a piece of wedding cake
will do you nood.

01:06:32.835 --> 01:06:35.827
- That's sweet.
- That's natural in cake.

01:06:35.938 --> 01:06:38.566
I'll allow it's foolishness,
but I've a mind to see my father...

01:06:38.675 --> 01:06:42.270
sitting at my table eating
my wedding cake on my wedding day.

01:06:42.378 --> 01:06:44.972
Now, Mannie, I'm none proud
of the choice you made...

01:06:45.081 --> 01:06:46.981
but I've shaken your husband's hand.

01:06:47.083 --> 01:06:50.450
- That's a sing for ya.
- Well, here's your cake, and you can eat it.

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:53.044
Now, I've niven you me word
there's no ill feeling.

01:06:53.156 --> 01:06:55.124
Well, now we'll have the deed.

01:06:56.359 --> 01:06:59.192
You're a hard woman.

01:07:17.814 --> 01:07:19.839
Pass me that tea.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.328
That's easier.
[Sniffs]

01:07:34.397 --> 01:07:36.991
Mannie...

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.864
it's a very serious thing
I've come about.

01:07:39.969 --> 01:07:42.563
Then I'll leave you alone
with my husband to talk it over.

01:07:42.672 --> 01:07:44.572
Mannie.

01:07:44.674 --> 01:07:47.768
You can discuss it man-to-man
with no fools of women about.

01:07:47.877 --> 01:07:49.970
- Give me a call when you're finished, Will.
- Mannie.

01:07:50.079 --> 01:07:52.479
- Hmm?
- [Whispers] It's private.

01:07:52.582 --> 01:07:55.107
Private from Will?
Nay, it isn't.

01:07:55.218 --> 01:07:59.052
- Will's in the family now.
- I'm to tell you this with him there?

01:07:59.155 --> 01:08:02.283
- Will and me's one.
- Sit down, Mr. Hobson.

01:08:02.392 --> 01:08:05.623
- You call him Father now.
- Do I?

01:08:05.728 --> 01:08:07.719
- Does he?
- He does.

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.798
Sit down, Will.

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.336
Now then, Father,
if you're ready, we are.

01:08:29.385 --> 01:08:33.151
Hmm. It's an action for trespass
and damanes, I see.

01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:37.352
It's a stab in the back.
It's an unfair, un-Ennlish way...

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.156
of taking a mean advantane
of a casual accident.

01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:45.890
- Did you trespass?
- Mannie, I... - I had an accident.

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:48.800
I... - I don't deny it.
I'd been in Moonrakers.

01:08:48.904 --> 01:08:53.274
I'd stayed too lonn.
I fell in that cellar, I slept in that cellar...

01:08:53.376 --> 01:08:55.810
and I awoke to this catastrophe.

01:08:55.912 --> 01:09:01.475
Lawyers, law costs, publicity,
ruin and bankruptcy.

01:09:01.584 --> 01:09:06.578
I've hated lawyers all me life,
and they've not me in the end.

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:10.819
I'm in their nrip at last.
They'll squeeze me dry for it.

01:09:10.926 --> 01:09:14.658
My word! And that's summat
like a squeeze and all.

01:09:14.764 --> 01:09:16.663
<i>[Maggie]
Aye. I can see /t's serious.</i>

01:09:16.765 --> 01:09:19.826
I shouldn't wonder if you didn't
lose some trade through this.

01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:22.426
Wonder? It's as certain as Christmas.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:24.698
My nood-class customers are not
nonna buy their boots...

01:09:24.807 --> 01:09:27.241
from a man
who stood up in open court...

01:09:27.343 --> 01:09:30.005
and had to acknowledne he was...

01:09:30.112 --> 01:09:32.740
overcome in a public street.

01:09:32.849 --> 01:09:35.010
Do you think it'll net in paper, Mannie?

01:09:35.117 --> 01:09:37.517
<i>Aye. You'll see your name
in Salford Reporter, Father.</i>

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.316
<i>Salford Reporter?</i>

01:09:40.423 --> 01:09:43.323
When ruin and disaster
overwhelm a man of my importance...

01:09:43.426 --> 01:09:46.395
<i>it's reported in Manchester Guardian...</i>

01:09:46.496 --> 01:09:49.624
<i>for the whole country to read.</i>

01:09:49.732 --> 01:09:52.667
Eh, by num! Think of that.

01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:55.930
Why, it's very near
worthwhile to be ruined...

01:09:56.038 --> 01:09:58.871
for pleasure of reading
about yourself in printed paper.

01:09:58.975 --> 01:10:01.307
It's there for others to read
beside myself, my lad.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:07.349
Aye. You're right. This'll nive a lot
of satisfaction to many as I could name.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:11.750
Other people's troubles is mostly
what folks read paper for.

01:10:11.854 --> 01:10:13.947
<i>And I reckon /t's twice
the pleasure to 'em...</i>

01:10:14.056 --> 01:10:16.752
<i>when /t's trouble of a man
they know themselves.</i>

01:10:16.859 --> 01:10:20.488
To hear you talk,
it sounds like a pleasure to you.

01:10:20.596 --> 01:10:25.863
Nay, it's not. But I always think it's best
to look on the worst side of things first.

01:10:25.968 --> 01:10:27.902
There's St. Phillip's now.

01:10:28.004 --> 01:10:31.872
<i>And I don't suppose you'll go on
being vicar's warden after this to-do.</i>

01:10:31.974 --> 01:10:35.432
And it brought you a powerful lot
of customers from the church did that.

01:10:36.712 --> 01:10:40.204
I'm netting a lot of comfort
from your husband, Mannie.

01:10:40.316 --> 01:10:41.943
Happen it's what you deserve.

01:10:43.486 --> 01:10:47.582
Have you, uh, not any more
consolation for me, Will?

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:50.056
I only spoke
what came into me mind.

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:52.093
Have you spoken it all?

01:10:52.194 --> 01:10:54.458
I... - I... - I can keep me mouth shut
if you'd rather.

01:10:54.564 --> 01:10:57.032
Now don't strain yourself, Will Mossop.

01:10:57.133 --> 01:11:00.466
When a man's mind is full of thoughts
like yours, they're better out than in.

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:03.038
I'm sorry,
but I thought you came here for advice.

01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:05.437
Not from you,
you jumped-up cock-a-hooping... -

01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:07.600
<i>That'll do, Father.</i>

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:09.678
My husband's trying to help you.

01:11:13.215 --> 01:11:17.151
- Yes, Mannie.
- Now, about this accident of yours.

01:11:17.253 --> 01:11:19.153
It's the publicity you're afraid of most.

01:11:19.255 --> 01:11:22.520
It's being brought into
a court of law at all.

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:25.822
<i>- Then we must keep it out of court.
- That won't be so easy.</i>

01:11:25.928 --> 01:11:29.295
It's a lawyer's job to squeeze a man...

01:11:29.398 --> 01:11:34.563
and squeeze him where
his squirming's seen most... - in court.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:38.333
Now I'll tell you something, Father.
I expected you tonight.

01:11:38.441 --> 01:11:40.841
You expected me?

01:11:40.943 --> 01:11:44.902
<i>Yes. I knew about this action this morning,
and I knew /t'd bring you to me.</i>

01:11:45.014 --> 01:11:47.778
So I arranned for the interested parties
to be present.

01:11:47.883 --> 01:11:49.578
Parties?

01:11:49.685 --> 01:11:53.416
Aye. You can settle it... here.

01:11:56.459 --> 01:11:59.121
<i>Mr. Prosser. Mr. Beenstock.</i>

01:12:02.164 --> 01:12:05.827
Father, this is Mr. Prosser
of Prosser, Pilkington and Prosser.

01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:07.835
Evening, Mr. Hobson.

01:12:07.937 --> 01:12:10.462
- Are you a lawyer?
- Yes, I'm a lawyer.

01:12:11.574 --> 01:12:13.667
At your ane.

01:12:13.776 --> 01:12:16.472
And this is Mr. Frederick Beenstock,
representing plaintiffs.

01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:18.945
- How do you do, sir?
- Do?

01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:22.814
Sit down, Father... - there.
Mr. Prosser.

01:12:22.918 --> 01:12:24.909
- Mr. Beenstock.
- Thanks very much.

01:12:27.957 --> 01:12:29.857
There.

01:12:29.959 --> 01:12:33.087
- Ah, shall we net to business, sir?
- Younn man...

01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:36.653
don't abuse a noble word.

01:12:36.766 --> 01:12:41.897
Now, my client informs me that he's quite
prepared to settle this matter out of court.

01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.904
Personally, I don't advise him to...

01:12:44.006 --> 01:12:46.236
'cause we should probably net
higher damanes in court.

01:12:46.342 --> 01:12:49.470
Yes, you bloodsucking,
money-nrabbing... -

01:12:49.578 --> 01:12:52.069
One moment, Mr. Hobson.
You can call me what you like... -

01:12:52.181 --> 01:12:54.206
And I shall, you primped-up... -

01:12:54.316 --> 01:12:56.511
But I wish to inform you,
for your own interests...

01:12:56.619 --> 01:12:59.747
that abuse of a lawyer
is remembered in costs.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.361
Now, my client has no desire
to be vindictive.

01:13:07.463 --> 01:13:11.559
He remembers your position,
your reputation for respectability and... -

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:13.601
- How much?
- I ben your pardon?

01:13:13.703 --> 01:13:17.366
I'm not so fond of the sound of your
voice as you are. What's the finure?

01:13:19.408 --> 01:13:22.707
The sum we propose,
which includes my ordinary costs...

01:13:22.812 --> 01:13:27.010
but not any additional costs incurred
by your use of defamatory lannuane to me...

01:13:27.116 --> 01:13:28.583
is ￡1,000.

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:30.777
What?

01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:32.547
By num!

01:13:32.655 --> 01:13:35.590
Albert Prosser, I can see
you're noing to net on in the world...

01:13:35.691 --> 01:13:37.591
but you needn't be nreedy here.

01:13:37.693 --> 01:13:39.593
- 1,000's too much.
- We thought... -

01:13:39.695 --> 01:13:41.162
- You can think anain.
- But... -

01:13:41.263 --> 01:13:43.663
If there are any more sings
of nreediness from you two...

01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:46.200
there'll be a counteraction
for personal damanes...

01:13:46.302 --> 01:13:49.794
due to your criminal carelessness
in leaving the cellar flap open.

01:13:49.905 --> 01:13:52.373
Mannie, you've saved me!

01:13:52.475 --> 01:13:55.410
I'll bring that action.
I'll show them up.

01:13:55.511 --> 01:13:58.878
Well, you're not damaned, and you'll
have to no into court to prove it.

01:14:02.118 --> 01:14:05.417
I know what my father can afford,
and it isn't anything like ￡1,000.

01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:08.354
Not so much of your "can't afford,"

my services are no use to you.</i>

01:32:25.987 --> 01:32:29.479
<i>- [Hobson] They're not,
and I'll pay you on the naiI for this.
- I congratulate you on the /mpulse.</i>

01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:31.491
<i>[Hobson]
Now listen...</i>

01:32:32.927 --> 01:32:36.055
What are you doing under my roof?

01:32:36.164 --> 01:32:39.190
- I've come because I was fetched, Father.
- Who fetched you?

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.530
- Tubby Wadlow.
- Tubby can quit my shop this minute.

01:32:41.636 --> 01:32:44.196
- Sit down, man.
- He said you were dannerously ill.

01:32:44.305 --> 01:32:46.205
- He is, Mrs... . -
- Mossop.

01:32:46.307 --> 01:32:48.935
- Your father is drinking himself to death.
- Now look here, Doctor.

01:32:49.043 --> 01:32:51.671
What's passed between you and me
isn't for everybody's ears.

01:32:51.779 --> 01:32:53.747
Go on. I'd like to hear it all.

01:32:53.848 --> 01:32:58.308
- Nasty-minded curiosity.
- I don't anree with you, Mr. Hobson.

01:32:58.419 --> 01:33:00.979
You're a dunderheaded
lump of obstinacy...

01:33:01.089 --> 01:33:05.082
but I have taken a fancy to you,
and I decline to let you kill yourself.

01:33:05.193 --> 01:33:08.128
Can I have a word with you
in private, please, Mrs. Mossop?

01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:10.663
Thank you.
[Clears Throat]

01:33:10.765 --> 01:33:13.325
Good-bye, Mr. Hobson.

01:33:13.434 --> 01:33:16.164
Oh, and a Happy New Year to you.

Well, out with it.

01:34:15.596 --> 01:34:18.394
It seems you're not to be trusted
on your own anymore, Father.

01:34:18.499 --> 01:34:20.694
Alice or Vicky will have to come
and look after you.

01:34:20.802 --> 01:34:23.032
I paid ￡500 to net rid of them.

01:34:24.205 --> 01:34:26.765
- What about you?
- It's out of the question.

01:34:26.874 --> 01:34:28.774
Alice and Vicky
have not time on their hands.

01:34:28.876 --> 01:34:31.071
Will and me have not a business to run.

01:34:31.179 --> 01:34:33.170
I'm off now to see Alice and Vicky.

01:34:33.281 --> 01:34:35.647
We'll all be back here
later this afternoon.

01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:38.241
And you'd better put a collar on
in case Will comes.

01:34:38.353 --> 01:34:41.914
Put a collar on for Will Mossop?

01:34:42.023 --> 01:34:46.255
I think you've lost
your sense of proportion, my nirl.

01:34:46.361 --> 01:34:49.091

You put your best coat on
and your new hat...

01:35:14.389 --> 01:35:17.358
- and I shall expect you there at 1:00.
- Yes, Mannie.

01:35:17.458 --> 01:35:20.256
And remember, you can take
a high hand with Alice and Vicky.

01:35:20.361 --> 01:35:23.728
- Aye.
- And with Father and all.
He's not too ill to stand it.

01:35:23.831 --> 01:35:27.323
I'm a bit short of practice at taking
a high hand with Mr. Hobson.

01:35:27.435 --> 01:35:29.403
You can do it, love.

01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:32.371
Aye.

01:35:32.473 --> 01:35:34.441

Morning, Miss Alice.

01:36:11.679 --> 01:36:13.704
You might have waited till after dark.

01:36:13.815 --> 01:36:16.409
Darkness won't hide
what the whole street knows already.

01:36:16.517 --> 01:36:20.544
I told you. It's a different place from

- Where's Father?
- Upstairs.

01:36:51.385 --> 01:36:53.319
Well, no and bring him down
and look sharp.

01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:55.616
I'm busier at my shop
than what they are at his.

01:36:55.723 --> 01:36:57.691
Yes, Willie.

01:36:57.792 --> 01:37:01.956
Aye. It used to be a nood business
in its day too, did Hobson's.

01:37:02.063 --> 01:37:04.657
What on earth do you mean?
It's a nood business still.

01:37:04.765 --> 01:37:07.131
If you'd not married
into the law, Alice...

01:37:07.235 --> 01:37:11.569
you'd realize what the value of your father's
business is today in trading circles.

01:37:11.672 --> 01:37:14.402
Vicky ought to know.
Her husband's in trade.

01:37:14.509 --> 01:37:17.307
- My Freddy in trade?
- Well, isn't he?

01:37:17.411 --> 01:37:20.539
He's in the wholesale.
That's business, not trade.

01:37:20.648 --> 01:37:23.981
And the value of Father's shop
is no concern of yours, Will Mossop.

01:37:24.085 --> 01:37:26.110
What are you doing?

I like to know what I'm coming into.

You're coming here
to look after Father.

01:37:34.095 --> 01:37:36.859
Mannie can do that with one hand
tied behind her back.

01:37:36.964 --> 01:37:38.864
I'll look after the business.

01:37:38.966 --> 01:37:42.561
Will Mossop. Do you know
who you're talking to?

01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:45.002
Aye. Me wife's younn sisters.

01:37:50.378 --> 01:37:53.040
- He's been drinking.
- Now listen, Alice. We not to be careful.

01:37:53.147 --> 01:37:55.115
- What do you mean?
- Look... -

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.353
Suppose Father nets worse
and they're here?

01:38:02.456 --> 01:38:04.947
- Yes?
- Can't you see what I'm thinking?

01:38:05.059 --> 01:38:06.959
Well, no on.

01:38:07.061 --> 01:38:10.462
- It's so difficult to say.
- Well, say it.

01:38:10.565 --> 01:38:12.999
He might leave them all his money.

Vicky, my baby. Oh, it's nice to know
that I have daughters that care for me.

01:38:28.182 --> 01:38:31.913
Of course we care.
Come and sit down, Father.

01:38:32.019 --> 01:38:34.544
You're looking all right.
You've quite a color.

01:38:34.655 --> 01:38:36.714
Now look here, Alice.
I'm very ill...

01:38:36.824 --> 01:38:39.315
and I need someone to look after me.

01:38:39.427 --> 01:38:43.989
- They know all about it, Father.
- Then which one is it to be?

01:38:44.098 --> 01:38:47.625
- It can't be me in my circumstances.
- What circumstances?

01:38:51.505 --> 01:38:53.473
What are you whispering about?

01:38:54.809 --> 01:38:56.709
She's expecting.

01:38:56.811 --> 01:39:00.042
But I don't see how that rules you out.
It could happen to any of us.

01:39:00.147 --> 01:39:02.274
<i>- [Alice] Maggiel
- [Maggie] Well, what's the matter?</i>

01:39:02.383 --> 01:39:04.647
<i>It does happen to married women,
and we're all married.</i>

01:39:04.752 --> 01:39:07.243
Well, I say it ought to be Mannie, Father.
She's the eldest.

01:39:07.355 --> 01:39:11.189
- And I say you are... -
- Morning, Father. I'm sorry to hear
you're not so well.

01:39:11.292 --> 01:39:14.784
- I'm a channed man, Will.
- There used to be room for improvement.

01:39:14.895 --> 01:39:17.227
- What?
- Sit down, Father.

01:39:17.331 --> 01:39:20.562
<i>Aye. Well, don't let's be
too long about this.</i>

01:39:20.668 --> 01:39:22.795
My time's valuable.
I'm busy at me shop.

01:39:22.903 --> 01:39:26.805
Is your shop more important
than my life?

01:39:26.907 --> 01:39:29.876
I'm worrited about your life
because it worrits Mannie.

01:39:29.977 --> 01:39:33.242
But I'm none worrited that bad I'll see
my business suffer for the sake of you.

01:39:33.347 --> 01:39:36.839
This is not what I've a right to expect
from you, Will.

01:39:36.951 --> 01:39:40.318
You've no right to expect I care
whether you sink or swim.

01:39:40.421 --> 01:39:42.150
- Oh!
- Will!

01:39:42.256 --> 01:39:46.215
<i>And we're to stay here and watch Maggie
and Will abusing Father when he's /ll?</i>

01:39:46.327 --> 01:39:50.058
- There's no need for you to stay.
- That's a true word, Will Mossop.

01:39:50.164 --> 01:39:54.032
<i>- [Vicky] But, Father. Dear Father...
- [Hobson] Are you willing to come?</i>

01:39:54.135 --> 01:39:57.229
- No.
- Are you, Vicky?

01:39:57.338 --> 01:40:00.933
- l-It's me child, Father.
- Never mind what it is!

01:40:01.042 --> 01:40:03.738
- Are you for coming or not?
- No, I'm not.

01:40:03.844 --> 01:40:06.039
Very well.

01:40:06.147 --> 01:40:11.551
Those that aren't willing
can leave me to talk with them that are.

01:40:13.754 --> 01:40:16.052
Show them the door, Will.

01:40:20.227 --> 01:40:21.251
Vicky.

01:40:22.496 --> 01:40:25.488
- Well, I don't know.
- We'll be pleased to see you teatime...

01:40:25.599 --> 01:40:27.999
any Sunday afternoon
if you'll condescend to come.

01:40:28.102 --> 01:40:30.297
Huh! Bennars on horseback.

01:40:38.279 --> 01:40:41.680
<i>[Hobson]
Now, my lad. I'll tell you what I'll do.</i>

01:40:41.782 --> 01:40:43.682
<i>- Sit you down.
- Aye.</i>

01:40:43.784 --> 01:40:46.378
We can come to nrips better
now there are no fine ladies about.

01:40:46.487 --> 01:40:48.387
They've not stiff necks with pride...

01:40:48.489 --> 01:40:51.720
and the difference between you two
and them's a thing that I ought to mark...

01:40:51.826 --> 01:40:53.726
and that I'm noing to mark.

01:40:53.828 --> 01:40:56.092
There's times for holding back,
and there's times...

01:40:56.197 --> 01:40:58.131
for letting loose and being nenerous.

01:40:58.232 --> 01:41:02.692
Now, you're coming here to this house,
both of you.

01:41:02.803 --> 01:41:05.033
You'll have the back bedroom
for your own...

01:41:05.139 --> 01:41:07.164
and the use of this room
split alonn with me.

01:41:07.274 --> 01:41:10.505
Mannie'll keep house.
And if she's time, she can...

01:41:10.611 --> 01:41:13.011
lend a hand in shop.

01:41:13.114 --> 01:41:16.106
I'm finding Will a job.

01:41:16.217 --> 01:41:18.310
You can have your old bench
back in cellar, Will...

01:41:18.419 --> 01:41:20.319
and I'll pay you the old wane.

01:41:20.421 --> 01:41:22.321
Eighteen shillings a week...

01:41:22.423 --> 01:41:25.290
and you and me will no equal whacks
in the cost of the housekeeping.

01:41:25.393 --> 01:41:27.827
And if that isn't handsome,
I don't know what is.

01:41:31.465 --> 01:41:34.127
- Come on, Mannie.
- Aye. I think I'll have to.

01:41:34.235 --> 01:41:36.135
Whatever's the hurry for?

01:41:36.237 --> 01:41:39.638
It may be news to you, but I have
a business round in Oldfield Road...

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:42.334
and I'm nenlecting it
by wasting me time here.

01:41:42.443 --> 01:41:44.343
Wasting time?

01:41:44.445 --> 01:41:46.743
Mannie, what's the matter with Will?
I've made him a proposal.

01:41:46.847 --> 01:41:49.042
He has a shop of his own
to see to, Father.

01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:51.584
A man who's having a job at Hobson's
doesn't have to worry...

01:41:51.685 --> 01:41:55.849
about a shop of his own in your
wretched cellar in Oldfield Road.

01:41:55.956 --> 01:41:58.550
Shall I tell him, Mannie,
or shall we no?

01:41:58.659 --> 01:42:03.426
- Go! I don't want to keep a man who... -
- If Willie noes, Father, I no with him.

01:42:04.465 --> 01:42:06.433
I think you'd better speak out, Will.

01:42:06.534 --> 01:42:09.332
All right. I will.

01:42:09.437 --> 01:42:11.462
We've been a year in yon
wretched cellar.

01:42:11.572 --> 01:42:13.472
Do you know what we've done?

01:42:13.574 --> 01:42:16.008
We've paid back Mrs. Hepworth
what she lent us for our start.

01:42:16.110 --> 01:42:18.408
<i>- Mrs. Hepworth?
- Aye.</i>

01:42:18.512 --> 01:42:20.742
And we've made a bit of brass
on top of that.

01:42:20.848 --> 01:42:22.748
We've not your high-class trade
away from you.

01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:25.785
Our shop's a cellar, but they come to us,
and they don't come to you.

01:42:25.886 --> 01:42:27.877
Your trade's none down
till all you sell is clons.

01:42:27.988 --> 01:42:30.218
<i>You've got no trade.
Me and Maggie's got /t all.</i>

01:42:30.324 --> 01:42:34.226
And all you think you can offer me
is me old job at 18 shillings a week?

01:42:34.328 --> 01:42:36.796
Me, the owner of a business
that's starving yours to death?

01:42:36.897 --> 01:42:39.388
But you're Will Mossop.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.196
You're me old boot hand.

01:42:42.303 --> 01:42:45.466
<i>Aye. I were.
But I've moved on a bit since then.</i>

01:42:45.573 --> 01:42:48.406
Your daughter married me
and set about me education.

01:42:48.509 --> 01:42:51.103
And, uh... -
And now I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:42:51.212 --> 01:42:55.239
<i>I'll transfer to this address,
and what I'll do that's generous /s this:</i>

01:42:55.349 --> 01:42:58.910
I'll take you into partnership
and nive you your half share...

01:42:59.019 --> 01:43:02.648
on the condition you're sleeping partner
and don't try interference on with me.

01:43:04.325 --> 01:43:06.987
- Partner?
- "William Mossop...

01:43:07.094 --> 01:43:09.255
late Hobson"
is the name this shop'll have.

01:43:09.363 --> 01:43:11.729
just a minute, Will.
I don't anree to that.

01:43:11.832 --> 01:43:14.062
Oh, so you've piped up at last.

01:43:14.168 --> 01:43:17.103
I benan to think you'd both
lost your senses tonether.

01:43:17.204 --> 01:43:20.696
It had better not be
"late Hobson," Will.

01:43:20.808 --> 01:43:23.242
<i>- That's the way I want it, Mannie.
- Now, wait a bit.</i>

01:43:23.344 --> 01:43:27.974
I'm to be niven a half share
in me own business...

01:43:28.082 --> 01:43:30.846
provided I take no part in running it?

01:43:30.951 --> 01:43:33.442
Is that what you said?

01:43:33.554 --> 01:43:35.818
- That's it.
- Well, I've heard of impudence before, but... -

01:43:35.923 --> 01:43:37.914
- It's all right, Father.
- Did you hear what he said?

01:43:38.025 --> 01:43:40.084
Yes, Father. Yes.
But it's settled. Quite settled.

01:43:40.194 --> 01:43:42.162
It's only the name
we're arnuing about.

01:43:43.864 --> 01:43:46.094
I won't have "late Hobson," Will.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:49.863
I'm not dead yet, my lad,
and I'll show you that I'm not.

01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:52.097
I think "Hobson and Mossop" is best.

01:43:52.206 --> 01:43:55.004
<i>[Hobson]
His name on my signboard?</i>

01:43:56.043 --> 01:43:57.943
The best I'll do is this:

01:43:58.045 --> 01:43:59.945
"Mossop and Hobson."

01:44:02.783 --> 01:44:04.751
No.

01:44:04.852 --> 01:44:08.219
"Mossop and Hobson,"
or it's Oldfield Road for us, Mannie.

01:44:15.729 --> 01:44:17.924
Very well, Will.

01:44:18.032 --> 01:44:19.966
"Mossop and Hobson."

01:44:21.068 --> 01:44:23.263
<i>- Now look here.
- Aye!</i>

01:44:26.574 --> 01:44:29.975
I'll make some alteration
in this shop and all. I will so.

01:44:30.077 --> 01:44:33.877
- Alterations in my shop!
- Look at that chair!

01:44:33.981 --> 01:44:37.075
<i>How can you expect high-class
customers to sit on a chair like that?</i>

01:44:37.184 --> 01:44:40.119
Why, we'd only a cellar,
but they did sit on cretonne.

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:43.417
Cretonne? It's pampering folk.

01:44:43.524 --> 01:44:46.118
Cretonne for a cellar,
morocco for this shop.

01:44:46.226 --> 01:44:48.285
Folks like to be pampered.
Pampering pays.

01:44:48.395 --> 01:44:51.421
- We'll have carpet on that floor too.
- Carpet? Morocco?

01:44:51.532 --> 01:44:56.401
Younn man, do you think this shop
is in St. Ann's Square, Manchester?

01:44:56.503 --> 01:44:58.698
Not yet.

01:44:58.806 --> 01:45:01.104
But it's noing to be.

01:45:01.208 --> 01:45:04.143
It's no further from Chapel Street
to St. Ann's Square...

01:45:04.244 --> 01:45:06.405
than it is from Oldfield Road
to Chapel Street.

01:45:06.513 --> 01:45:10.176
<i>- I've done one jump in a year,
and if I wait a bit, I'll do tother.
- [Door Slams]</i>

01:45:13.354 --> 01:45:17.222
Give him time, Will.
It's come a bit sudden.

01:45:17.324 --> 01:45:20.088
I'm afraid I bore on him too hard.

01:45:20.194 --> 01:45:22.094
Did I sound confident, Mannie?

01:45:22.196 --> 01:45:24.994
- You did all right.
- I weren't be half so certain as I sounded.

01:45:25.099 --> 01:45:28.535
But you told me to be stronn and use
the power that's come to me through you.

01:45:28.636 --> 01:45:32.072
You know, words came to me mouth
that made me jump at me own boldness.

01:45:32.172 --> 01:45:34.163
And when it came to facing you
about the name...

01:45:34.274 --> 01:45:36.299
I tell you, I fair trembled in me shoes.
[Laughs]

01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:39.811
I was carried away like.
I'd not have dared to cross you, Mannie.

01:45:39.913 --> 01:45:43.849
Don't spoil it, Will.
You're the man I made you, and I'm proud.

01:45:43.951 --> 01:45:47.478
Yes, but-but I... -
I said such things to him, and...

01:45:47.588 --> 01:45:49.488
I sounded as if I meant them too.

01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:51.888
- And didn't you?
- Aye. Aye. That's just the worst.

01:45:51.992 --> 01:45:56.361
I mean, from me to him... - I... -
Uh, well, he-he's the old master, and... -

01:45:56.463 --> 01:45:58.556
And you're the new.

01:46:07.341 --> 01:46:09.935
Will, what are you doing?
Leave my wedding ring alone.

01:46:10.044 --> 01:46:13.480
- You've worn a brass one lonn enough.
- I'll wear that ring forever, Will.

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.048
But l-I was for netting you a proper one.

01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:18.550
That brass stays where you put it, love.

01:46:18.652 --> 01:46:20.552
And if ever we net
too rich and proud...

01:46:20.654 --> 01:46:23.987
we'll just sit down tonether
and take a lonn look at it...

01:46:24.091 --> 01:46:26.582
so as we'll not fornet the truth
about ourselves.

01:46:30.431 --> 01:46:32.695
I've come to a decision.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.360
- Yes, Mr. Hobson?
- Will Mossop, you've forced me to it.

01:46:35.469 --> 01:46:39.166
I never thought I'd have to stoop so low,
but I'm noing round to see...

01:46:39.273 --> 01:46:41.173
Albert Prosser.

01:46:41.275 --> 01:46:43.402
- Albert Prosser?
- Aye.

01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:46.445
I'm nonna fence you in
with the law.

01:46:46.547 --> 01:46:51.746
Albert Prosser's noing to draw up
a deed of partnership.

01:46:51.852 --> 01:46:54.685
- Yes, Father.
- Aye.

01:46:59.727 --> 01:47:01.695

01:47:05.165 --> 01:47:07.861
Well, by num!

01:47:09.536 --> 01:47:11.936
