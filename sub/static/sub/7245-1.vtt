WEBVTT

00:23.631 --> 00:25.597
Let's go!

00:26.733 --> 00:28.257
Get down!

00:28.602 --> 00:30.331
Get over here!

00:32.607 --> 00:34.438
I love it!

00:37.744 --> 00:39.609
Shut up!

00:39.847 --> 00:41.337
Big fun.

00:41.449 --> 00:44.782
Charlie, unload the cash drawers.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.814
Hot.

00:58.565 --> 01:00.555
What the fuck!

01:00.934 --> 01:02.423
Charlie.

01:02.970 --> 01:05.096
Go check it out.

01:21.788 --> 01:23.778
Mom! Mom!

01:24.258 --> 01:25.951
Shut up!

01:40.574 --> 01:42.408
Don't you fucking move.

01:42.409 --> 01:46.469
Relax, man. I'll buy the
damn thing, all right?

01:48.781 --> 01:50.339
Charlie!

01:52.452 --> 01:54.887
- Son of a bitch.
- Shut up! Go check it out.

01:54.888 --> 01:57.480
- Screw that business, man.
- Hey.

01:58.090 --> 02:02.720
I said, "Check it fucking out." Now!

02:02.795 --> 02:04.661
Fuck, man.

02:07.466 --> 02:10.560
Why the fuck I got
to baby-sit? Charlie!

02:17.510 --> 02:19.238
Charlie!

02:27.787 --> 02:30.380
- My baby...
- Shut up!

02:30.389 --> 02:32.117
Come on.

02:33.893 --> 02:36.553
Is somebody playing with me?

02:37.529 --> 02:40.031
Somebody thinking they
can fuck with me?

02:40.032 --> 02:42.133
I'm going to kill Miss Tinselteeth.

02:42.134 --> 02:45.602
You wanna play? Okay, come here.

02:46.771 --> 02:48.260
Try me.

02:55.847 --> 02:57.905
Son of a bitch!

03:15.834 --> 03:19.870
Joe, what the hell's going on?
You're still on suspension.

03:19.871 --> 03:21.939
Let me see you sweet-talk
your way out of this one.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.429
Huff.

03:24.776 --> 03:28.404
What have you got to say
for yourself this time?

03:28.780 --> 03:30.804
You got to clean up on Aisle 4.

04:30.874 --> 04:32.841
Better not shoot me, baby.

04:38.649 --> 04:42.812
Man, that's bullshit.
Try it up here, motherfucker.

04:45.521 --> 04:49.287
Come on. That's it.
Give me some head, baby.

04:50.994 --> 04:53.196
All right, brother.

04:53.197 --> 04:54.959
Come on, man.

04:57.867 --> 05:01.235
Well, that's cute, baby.
Look at what I got here.

05:01.338 --> 05:03.738
Try that, motherfucker.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.941
I demand the death penalty

05:39.942 --> 05:42.103
Court will come to order!

05:44.480 --> 05:48.650
The jury has found the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

05:48.651 --> 05:53.622
I hereby sentence you to 45
years, in the State Penitentiary

05:53.623 --> 05:56.454
without possibility of parole.

07:20.275 --> 07:22.333
Yo, Fido!

07:32.487 --> 07:35.682
Here we go. Soup's on, my man.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.624
What's up? Aren't
you hungry? Come here.

07:43.130 --> 07:47.066
Listen up. You're gonna have to eat
your grub if you wanna be a stud.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.669
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.567
Go away.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.640
Why don't they ever listen?

08:03.117 --> 08:05.106
Eat your food.

08:11.292 --> 08:15.420
- What?
- Joe Huff? FBI.

08:43.756 --> 08:47.192
Officer Huff, this is Special
Agent Frank Cunningham.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.596
He's aware of your three-week
suspension for insubordination.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.365
Chains Cooper. Runs the
Brotherhood in Mississippi.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.734
They've been on a killing spree.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.971
Three local religious figures were
murdered there in the last month.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.306
They convicted one
Brotherhood biker of it.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.942
The day after the sentencing,
the judge was found dead.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.343
Yeah, I read about it.

09:05.344 --> 09:08.146
We know they're responsible,
we just can't prove it.

09:08.147 --> 09:11.083
We also suspect them of
working with the Mafia.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.286
They're trying to branch
out nationwide into drugs,

09:14.287 --> 09:17.254
contract hits,
prostitution, you name it.

09:17.255 --> 09:20.247
Washington wants to shut them down.

09:20.526 --> 09:23.261
So then you're not investigating me?

09:23.262 --> 09:27.498
You've logged more biker-related arrests
than any other officer in Alabama.

09:27.499 --> 09:29.433
How would you go about
nailing these guys?

09:29.434 --> 09:31.870
The agent infiltrates
the organization,

09:31.871 --> 09:35.771
turns a witness, sets up a sting,
nabs them in the act.

09:36.174 --> 09:38.574
That's right, isn't it?

09:38.710 --> 09:43.944
Yeah. I'd give him three days before
they drag his ass down the interstate.

09:44.450 --> 09:48.214
- Don't you think if they take a prospect...
- Prospect?

09:49.254 --> 09:53.919
- A prospect's a new member on probation.
- Like a fraternity brother?

09:54.227 --> 09:55.715
Yeah.

09:56.461 --> 10:00.031
How do you feel about working in
Mississippi under FBI jurisdiction?

10:00.032 --> 10:03.200
We can arrange to have
your suspension lifted.

10:03.201 --> 10:06.270
We want you to go undercover
inside the Brotherhood.

10:06.271 --> 10:08.706
Agent Dockery will be
your contact in the field.

10:08.707 --> 10:10.697
Call me Lance.

10:13.578 --> 10:16.614
No sale. I think I'll sit
out my three weeks.

10:16.615 --> 10:22.052
Well, Huff, your three week suspension
just became six months. Without pay.

10:23.088 --> 10:25.755
- On the other hand...
- That's blackmail.

10:25.756 --> 10:29.055
No, the FBI doesn't
believe in blackmail.

10:31.763 --> 10:34.026
The choice is yours.

10:39.136 --> 10:44.301
Good morning. It's 6:02, time to rise
and shine. Glad you're aboard with us.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.209
This can't be happening to me.

10:46.210 --> 10:50.480
I got cafÃ© au lait here. I've got
croissants and those beignet-type things.

10:50.481 --> 10:54.919
Even got a bran muffin to get you started.
Are you a bit cranky this morning, Joe?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.253
I wasn't until you showed up.

10:57.254 --> 11:00.382
Okay, fine. So let's rap.

11:00.524 --> 11:02.759
The sooner we get started...

11:02.760 --> 11:05.895
The sooner we can stop
the forces of evil, yeah.

11:05.896 --> 11:09.032
I thought maybe we could set
up some lines of communication

11:09.033 --> 11:11.334
and talk about a
general plan of action

11:11.335 --> 11:15.737
where you can reach me; phone number,
beeper. Since I am your partner.

11:16.207 --> 11:19.107
I don't work with a partner, man.

11:24.415 --> 11:27.475
Joe, do you have a dog?

11:41.999 --> 11:45.000
What's the matter? Haven't you
ever seen one of those before?

11:45.001 --> 11:47.992
Yeah, but not quite that well-made.

11:48.538 --> 11:53.373
- Wake up, baby. You'll be late for work.
- Okay.

11:55.512 --> 11:58.310
- Say hi to the schmuck.
- Hi.

11:58.615 --> 12:00.104
Hi.

12:46.829 --> 12:48.462
What are you doing here?

12:48.463 --> 12:51.533
I thought I'd help you
out on your first night.

12:51.534 --> 12:53.902
Blend into the background incognito.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.604
The collar up is no
good, right? I knew that.

12:56.605 --> 13:00.341
Come on, you're ruining
the whole goddamn...

13:00.342 --> 13:02.311
Why don't you rub some
grease on your hair?

13:02.312 --> 13:04.446
No, I draw the line at that.

13:04.447 --> 13:09.083
If I get any germs, I'll be eating the
whole spectrum of antibiotics for a week.

13:09.084 --> 13:13.021
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm a little phobic, okay?

13:13.022 --> 13:17.058
Just a little bit hypochondriacal.
It's a problem, but I'm dealing with it.

13:17.059 --> 13:19.927
- Does Cunningham know you're out here?
- No.

13:19.928 --> 13:23.886
- Then what are you doing here, Lance?
- Facing my fears?

13:24.200 --> 13:26.030
Follow me.

13:40.649 --> 13:43.017
This club's one of six
owned by the Brotherhood.

13:43.018 --> 13:46.686
Truckers get their rocks off
by watching the girls dance.

13:46.687 --> 13:49.520
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

13:50.792 --> 13:54.961
The girls sell speed back to the truckers.
That's where your bank is.

13:54.962 --> 13:59.023
- And get two cold ones.
- May I have a glass, too, please?

13:59.635 --> 14:02.228
There's your glass, Junior.

14:04.573 --> 14:07.438
Casanova with the broad upstairs.

14:08.910 --> 14:13.147
- The one who looks like a roach?
- Yeah, the one who looks like a roach.

14:13.148 --> 14:16.850
That's Ice Hensley, sergeant
at arms at the Bayou Chapter.

14:16.851 --> 14:21.515
If I rattle his cage, that puts me one
step closer to our man Chains Cooper.

14:22.724 --> 14:25.492
I just don't know how to do it.

14:25.493 --> 14:28.723
He does look kind
of viral, doesn't he?

14:30.631 --> 14:33.861
Tell you what. I'm going to
make some noise. Sit tight.

14:36.037 --> 14:38.138
Excuse me. Can I have
another glass, please?

14:38.139 --> 14:40.334
This one is filthy. Thank you.

14:50.051 --> 14:51.151
Hey, Ice.

14:51.152 --> 14:52.886
Answer me a question.

14:52.887 --> 14:56.651
How come your lady's been
eyeing my tail all night?

14:59.060 --> 15:01.585
My. What have we got here?

15:01.963 --> 15:05.829
Looks like we got us a
grown-up version of Bam-Bam.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.469
You sure are pretty, Bam-Bam.

15:09.470 --> 15:13.139
- Look, I just asked a question.
- You're really a pretty boy.

15:13.140 --> 15:16.976
Ain't he a pretty boy?
Real pretty face.

15:16.977 --> 15:19.843
How'd you like me to
fuck it up for you?

15:21.114 --> 15:23.242
What do you want?

15:24.318 --> 15:26.251
I just got out of the pen.

15:26.252 --> 15:29.588
I heard you boys were the heavy
hitters in town. I guess I was wrong.

15:29.589 --> 15:32.492
- You're a yard bird, motherfucker?
- I did my time.

15:32.493 --> 15:36.257
Pretty boy like you must
have done some painful time.

15:37.364 --> 15:41.000
You gonna use that stick?
You wanna dance with me?

15:41.001 --> 15:43.992
Ice, get down here!

15:48.742 --> 15:51.310
Let me go! Get out of here!

15:51.311 --> 15:54.146
We want our money back,
and we want it right now.

15:54.147 --> 15:56.672
You sold us some bad shit.

15:56.815 --> 16:00.619
I heard the bitch say haul your ass!
You can do it, or I will.

16:00.620 --> 16:04.890
We didn't come here for no fight.
Just give us $1,000 and we're gone.

16:04.891 --> 16:08.359
I got news for you, baby.
You're already gone.

16:18.604 --> 16:19.905
Ice, man.

16:19.906 --> 16:22.670
Ice! Ice, man.

16:34.654 --> 16:36.643
You all right?

16:38.457 --> 16:40.652
Damn, man.

16:50.469 --> 16:54.132
Next time, mind your own
fucking business, honey.

16:54.473 --> 16:58.431
You're welcome. He's a nice guy.

17:01.113 --> 17:05.015
- Thanks, man. You got a name?
- John Stone.

17:05.016 --> 17:07.541
People around here call me Gut.

17:09.188 --> 17:10.454
Good.

17:10.455 --> 17:15.358
The Brotherhood is having a rally this
weekend. Why don't you come down?

17:15.726 --> 17:18.751
- I'll look forward to it.
- All right.

18:19.490 --> 18:23.323
Let's go, asshole. Come on, Bam-Bam.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.595
Damn!

18:48.218 --> 18:52.314
You ran one hell of a race,
dude. Too damn good.

18:55.492 --> 18:57.482
Fuck him over!

19:14.544 --> 19:16.670
Hey, Stone, man.

19:17.013 --> 19:20.505
Go on, Stone. You can get him, man.

19:23.186 --> 19:25.277
Come on, Stone.

19:39.736 --> 19:42.136
Is that all you've got?

19:56.252 --> 19:58.186
Fucking wimp.

19:58.187 --> 20:01.121
Come on, Stone. Get up!

20:04.694 --> 20:07.286
Goddamn pussy.

20:17.906 --> 20:19.873
Kick his ass.

20:31.553 --> 20:34.613
Come on, Stone.

21:12.460 --> 21:15.588
Way to go, Stone.

21:23.905 --> 21:27.140
You beat that dude, man. That's
something I thought I'd never see.

21:27.141 --> 21:29.009
Give me my glasses.

21:29.010 --> 21:32.079
- All right. You were great, man.
- Yeah.

21:32.080 --> 21:37.217
Chains, this is John Stone.
Stone, this is Chains.

21:37.218 --> 21:41.085
- Can you get your ass out of my van?
- Chill out, man.

21:41.989 --> 21:45.257
I heard you and Gut
tasted some tar together.

21:45.258 --> 21:47.658
Some knuckle sandwiches.

21:48.496 --> 21:52.397
- What club are you with?
- No club. Independent.

21:53.067 --> 21:56.068
I want to know why your old
lady's going through my shit.

21:56.069 --> 21:58.264
She's a cockroach.

21:58.605 --> 22:03.509
She's my house mouse.
Go slice your wrist, Gut.

22:03.878 --> 22:07.346
- Thanks, Chains.
- Come on, let's go party, all right?

22:07.581 --> 22:11.175
I ain't gonna tell you again.
Get out of my van.

22:12.086 --> 22:16.188
You did good at the Tit for Tat.
It showed some attitude around here.

22:16.189 --> 22:20.216
Yeah, whatever. Come on,
get out of here.

22:20.694 --> 22:25.028
Take my old lady and have some fun.
We'll talk business later.

22:26.800 --> 22:31.737
If you're gonna talk to the Brotherhood,
you're gonna have to talk to me.

22:32.773 --> 22:37.176
- I take it you don't want me in your van?
- You're right. I don't.

22:37.177 --> 22:40.746
Relax, man. I'm gonna
show you a real good time.

22:40.747 --> 22:42.681
No, you're not.

22:42.682 --> 22:44.410
Why not?

22:46.887 --> 22:49.288
Because unlike your old man,

22:49.289 --> 22:53.520
I never thought a pretty lady was
something you just gave away.

22:59.699 --> 23:04.965
I don't know, brother. Big boy rides in out
of nowhere, throwing his weight around.

23:05.604 --> 23:10.371
- It smells too sweet. I don't trust him.
- I smell business.

23:11.945 --> 23:14.969
You know me, baby. I'm a worrywart.

23:19.151 --> 23:23.713
It's you and me, Stone. We're going
to get into each other's heads.

23:25.224 --> 23:28.522
You might not like
what you find, Chains.

24:00.559 --> 24:04.229
A member of the Brotherhood
murders a minister in cold blood.

24:04.230 --> 24:08.324
Judge gives him a lenient sentence,
he's blown to bits in return.

24:09.401 --> 24:12.233
The days of leniency
are over, my friends.

24:17.775 --> 24:22.679
Gentlemen, the Gulfport chapter of
the Brotherhood sends its regards.

24:23.349 --> 24:25.282
Got a little donation.

24:25.283 --> 24:27.182
But you're late.

24:28.419 --> 24:33.558
Tell me something. Why we should put
up with the bullshit if the Army wouldn't?

24:33.559 --> 24:37.721
Fuck the Army, man.
That's just why I deserted.

24:38.396 --> 24:40.964
Take a look at that piece of shit.

24:40.965 --> 24:42.900
I intend to appeal this sentencing

24:42.901 --> 24:46.436
as many times as it takes
to get the death sentence.

24:46.437 --> 24:51.203
And as the Governor of this great
state, if you choose to elect me,

24:51.943 --> 24:56.480
I will make the war on the
underworld my first priority.

24:56.481 --> 24:59.711
We're gonna eight-six him.
Cut him off.

24:59.717 --> 25:03.277
I'm gonna crack the Whip.
He's as good as dead.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.822
Who are you?

25:06.823 --> 25:09.918
Stone. I've got a package for Chains.

25:28.579 --> 25:33.710
Tool, it's okay. Stone, man,
where have you been?

25:34.185 --> 25:38.484
Chains has been asking about you.
You gonna prospect or what?

25:52.903 --> 25:55.705
I'll get you something to eat, man.

25:55.706 --> 25:58.003
What's up, brothers?

26:09.353 --> 26:11.387
What's up, Chains?

26:11.388 --> 26:14.186
- What's that?
- A little present.

26:15.224 --> 26:18.160
I think you're gonna need
this when we do business.

26:18.161 --> 26:22.927
What is it? A letter
bomb, man? Open that.

26:25.234 --> 26:27.668
A bulletproof vest, man.

26:33.076 --> 26:35.566
This is government-issue.

26:37.813 --> 26:40.110
Where did you get it?

26:40.149 --> 26:43.986
Don't play games with me, Chains.
Half my stash is government-issue.

26:43.987 --> 26:49.082
So's every pistol in this room.
Including that piece in your pants.

26:54.164 --> 26:57.257
You're right, boy. Let's try this on.

26:59.902 --> 27:02.302
Gotta see how it looks.

27:03.806 --> 27:07.833
- Turn around.
- Jump down, turn around.

27:20.856 --> 27:23.017
I guess it works.

27:24.993 --> 27:27.120
Chains, my man,

27:29.899 --> 27:33.027
don't ever play games
with me, Chains.

27:37.539 --> 27:40.975
- Ice, wait!
- This motherfucker deserves to die!

27:40.976 --> 27:42.807
He's mine!

27:45.680 --> 27:48.478
You've got balls of steel, Stone.

27:48.717 --> 27:51.151
You wanna prospect
with the Brotherhood?

27:51.152 --> 27:52.252
I say no way.

27:52.253 --> 27:56.423
This is either gonna be the
biggest pork chop I ever ate

27:56.424 --> 27:57.891
or my bulldozer.

27:57.892 --> 28:01.795
- This is fucking bullshit.
- What do you say?

28:01.796 --> 28:05.732
- What's in it for me?
- Colors, man. Gut!

28:08.369 --> 28:11.705
This may be a rag to the
walking dead out there,

28:11.706 --> 28:15.265
but this is my flag,

28:15.443 --> 28:18.810
my cross, my church.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.814
And these colors don't run.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.218
If they hit the ground
even in a fight,

28:25.219 --> 28:29.156
I will peel your skin off
with a knife dipped in shit.

28:31.226 --> 28:33.125
I'm waiting.

28:34.763 --> 28:36.957
All right, I'm game.

28:39.234 --> 28:44.068
That was round one, citizen.
Our Pensacola chapter needs an ear.

28:45.672 --> 28:48.541
- What do you mean, they need an ear?
- Mudfish.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.805
You'll recognize it.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.979
Tattooed. Wearing an
earring like this.

28:56.950 --> 29:02.114
Name and address. Shouldn't be
hard to find, even for you.

29:03.658 --> 29:04.725
What did he do?

29:04.726 --> 29:09.093
Crossed our territory with a
couple of keys of Bolivian flake.

29:09.596 --> 29:12.394
You carrying? You got a gun?

29:13.100 --> 29:14.368
What for?

29:14.369 --> 29:16.893
So he'll hold still, man.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.620
You're a hell of a dancer, man.

31:16.621 --> 31:19.523
- Thanks, amigo.
- You've got some great moves.

31:19.524 --> 31:22.426
You should be one of
those Solid Gold dancers.

31:22.427 --> 31:25.896
- A performance like that, I'd take a bow.
- Yeah?

31:25.897 --> 31:29.133
You know what?
Don't fuck with me, okay?

31:29.134 --> 31:31.659
No, seriously, take a bow.

31:36.408 --> 31:39.843
Excuse me. Trash going out.

31:41.479 --> 31:45.470
I know my rights! What do you want?

31:48.253 --> 31:50.482
What are you doing?

31:53.959 --> 31:57.689
Let me go! Fuck. What are you doing?

31:57.829 --> 32:02.265
Police? You Federals!
What the... Let me go.

32:03.368 --> 32:06.502
I've tattooed tits.
I've tattooed a flabby ass.

32:06.503 --> 32:10.064
I ain't never tattooed
no corpse's ear before.

32:11.142 --> 32:13.544
My grandfather used
to take a chicken,

32:13.545 --> 32:16.479
cut its head off, put it on the
ground and watch it run around.

32:16.480 --> 32:20.780
I see you again, I'll introduce
you to him. Don't come back.

32:20.918 --> 32:25.514
What comes around goes around,
you fucking pinche gringo!

32:43.007 --> 32:45.702
Look what the cat dragged in.

32:45.809 --> 32:47.610
Here's your ear.

32:47.611 --> 32:49.840
How did it go, man?

32:50.748 --> 32:54.513
Let's just say I saved the
guy a fortune in Q-tips.

32:56.353 --> 32:59.981
These are for you,
my lovely. Smell that.

33:05.561 --> 33:08.264
They're not exactly to die for.

33:08.265 --> 33:10.892
The day's not over yet, man.

33:11.635 --> 33:16.298
Tool and Nancy have got some
collecting to do downtown. Oversee it.

33:18.007 --> 33:20.839
- That's my gig.
- It's his now.

33:24.214 --> 33:26.581
He's not even a member.

33:26.582 --> 33:29.551
- Are you ready?
- Do I have a choice?

33:29.552 --> 33:32.646
There are no golden calves here, man.

33:40.763 --> 33:43.891
- Biloxi Police.
- Hi, baby.

33:44.134 --> 33:46.268
What can I do for you today?

33:46.269 --> 33:48.737
I'm sending you a picture
of a guy named John Stone.

33:48.738 --> 33:50.739
I want you to run an NCIC on him.

33:50.740 --> 33:54.743
- I need it yesterday, all right?
- All right. I'll get back to you.

33:54.744 --> 33:56.643
All right.

34:02.618 --> 34:04.380
Bullshit.

34:23.206 --> 34:26.426
- Why you take so much?
- Don't start no shit.

34:26.427 --> 34:29.168
- Come on, Tool.
- Don't fuck with me.

34:32.447 --> 34:34.449
See you later. Bye.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.983
What was that behind my back?

34:35.984 --> 34:38.418
My poor brother in Vietnam.

34:39.387 --> 34:40.920
- What was that?
- Nothing.

34:40.922 --> 34:43.824
- You got family here or something?
- You wouldn't understand.

34:43.826 --> 34:46.060
- Why should I explain it to you?
- What?

34:46.061 --> 34:49.630
- You want me to give you some money?
- You know what? They work real hard.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.759
- Take it. Get out of here.
- Thanks.

34:53.400 --> 34:58.634
Goddamn bikers collecting in my territory.
There's that little son of a bitch.

34:59.708 --> 35:01.470
Oh, shit!

35:07.916 --> 35:12.853
Stupid lady tried to hold back a couple
of hundred. Brother's would eat her...

35:16.891 --> 35:18.381
Hey!

35:19.060 --> 35:20.995
Come on, let's go.

35:20.996 --> 35:22.758
Fuck you!

35:26.267 --> 35:29.201
Can you believe this fucking guy?

35:29.203 --> 35:32.502
You picked up the
wrong passenger, buddy.

35:33.842 --> 35:36.775
Come on, what are you waiting for?

36:02.036 --> 36:03.730
Freeze.

36:03.938 --> 36:07.674
I'm not gonna tell you biker
pricks again. This is my territory.

36:07.675 --> 36:11.667
Tell Chains to keep his
castles out of my sandbox.

36:12.079 --> 36:14.103
Get in the car.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.380
We're out of here.

36:27.126 --> 36:30.163
- You like to tell me who the hell that was?
- His name's Domicci.

36:30.164 --> 36:33.656
He got the money and
Chains is gonna kill me.

36:35.435 --> 36:38.665
- How much was there?
- $400.

36:41.075 --> 36:42.667
Here.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.512
Take it.

36:47.513 --> 36:52.144
- I can't take this from you.
- Just don't forget where it came from.

37:10.837 --> 37:14.172
Excuse me. May I help you gentlemen?

37:14.173 --> 37:18.165
There are to be no visitors
in this hall. Can I help you?

37:18.478 --> 37:21.146
Fuck off. What are you looking at?

37:21.147 --> 37:23.615
I got something for you.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.812
I got you pineapple pizza.

37:30.690 --> 37:35.592
- Thanks, guys.
- What is this, a giant Q-tip?

37:40.700 --> 37:42.734
Can you see what's left?

37:42.735 --> 37:45.636
Let's see what's left.
They left the tool.

37:45.637 --> 37:47.872
They left the tool!

37:47.873 --> 37:51.209
Kill me, man. Please, Chains.

37:51.210 --> 37:54.246
- Man, we need you.
- Don't talk like that.

37:54.247 --> 37:56.580
Tool, I'm gonna give you my...

37:56.581 --> 38:00.642
Take that fucking harmonica
down to the parking lot, man.

38:01.219 --> 38:03.347
Sit by the bikes.

38:03.523 --> 38:06.820
Listen now. Know what I got for you?

38:07.326 --> 38:10.928
This one's gonna take
care of you. Right, Marie?

38:10.929 --> 38:14.333
You're going to marry him, right?
You're gonna take good care of him.

38:14.334 --> 38:17.461
I'm gonna marry you
myself, all right?

38:21.506 --> 38:24.475
Warfield's killing and
underworld bikers in general

38:24.476 --> 38:27.274
have become the campaign issue.

38:27.779 --> 38:31.916
Executing one member of the Brotherhood,
is just a drop in the bucket.

38:31.917 --> 38:34.752
These bikers work with the
Mafia in dealing drugs.

38:34.753 --> 38:39.090
We must hunt them down. Checkpoints
must be set up throughout the state.

38:39.091 --> 38:41.492
That is why, only a
couple of hours ago,

38:41.493 --> 38:46.019
I counseled the outgoing governor of
this state to call in the National Guard.

38:47.331 --> 38:49.230
Shut if off.

38:50.001 --> 38:52.162
Let's get the fuck out of here.

38:52.270 --> 38:54.638
If I was there,
this wouldn't have happened.

38:54.639 --> 38:59.472
But I promise you right now,
I'm gonna take care of Domicci, all right?

39:05.149 --> 39:08.618
- Is that what I think it is?
- P2P.

39:10.588 --> 39:12.522
See, now you're talking, Stone.

39:12.523 --> 39:17.392
I know a driver itching to unload 12 tons
of it. I need protection and a buyer.

39:17.695 --> 39:21.392
Just remember, it's my deal.

39:22.967 --> 39:25.301
- I got a buyer.
- Who?

39:25.302 --> 39:27.036
The wops.

39:27.037 --> 39:29.472
- Not Domicci?
- No, not Domicci.

39:29.473 --> 39:33.602
He's out of business.
His head is all fucked up.

39:43.454 --> 39:47.787
You knuckle-dragging wops
should keep Domicci under wraps.

39:53.330 --> 39:56.889
- A gift?
- Yeah, a gift.

40:14.884 --> 40:16.976
That's very nice.

40:18.254 --> 40:20.389
But I don't ride.

40:20.390 --> 40:24.258
That's good. Very funny. Open it.

40:41.244 --> 40:44.577
Listen, I got some P2P here.

40:45.814 --> 40:48.306
This is impossible to get.

40:48.418 --> 40:51.453
In about a week, there's gonna
be a truck coming through here

40:51.454 --> 40:53.889
with three dozen
50-gallon drums on it.

40:53.890 --> 40:57.324
That's enough crank to wind
up half the Gulf Coast.

40:58.126 --> 41:01.391
Hey, I wouldn't sniff
that shit if I was you.

41:07.803 --> 41:10.032
$50,000 a drum.

41:10.773 --> 41:12.740
Another gift.

41:12.842 --> 41:15.206
Let's get out of here.

41:17.713 --> 41:19.714
I intend to appeal this sentencing

41:19.715 --> 41:23.481
as many time as it takes
to get the death sentence.

41:27.789 --> 41:31.986
... sentencing as many times as it
takes to get the death sentence.

41:34.430 --> 41:36.453
... to get the death sentence.

41:42.804 --> 41:45.932
Death.

41:53.682 --> 41:56.878
Death. Death. Death. Death.

42:18.940 --> 42:20.965
Open it, Poker.

42:43.364 --> 42:46.594
You going to fuck with
my serenity, Ice?

42:49.070 --> 42:50.503
I think we should talk.

42:50.504 --> 42:54.174
I know why you're here, man.
That fear is gonna rot your heart out.

42:54.175 --> 42:55.609
My fear?

42:55.610 --> 42:59.910
So far, I'm the only one who's
been doing any of the killing.

43:02.083 --> 43:04.551
You wanna know what my fear is?

43:04.552 --> 43:08.688
My fear is that this boy Stone has got
you wrapped around his little finger.

43:08.689 --> 43:10.657
We have a lot at stake.

43:10.658 --> 43:14.060
I'm afraid when we wake up tomorrow,
he's gonna be in on everything.

43:14.061 --> 43:16.895
Gonna be in on the Whip.
I don't trust the man.

43:16.896 --> 43:21.368
If I want to, I'll milk him to a gourd.
I'll chop his arms and legs off

43:21.369 --> 43:25.395
and weld him into a steel tank
and drop him in the bayou.

43:25.772 --> 43:29.799
So fuck you, man.
The Whip's mine. Covert. D-Day.

43:34.315 --> 43:36.213
Real covert.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.756
I don't like what I'm
seeing, brother.

43:42.757 --> 43:45.486
I don't like what I'm hearing.

44:15.821 --> 44:17.652
It's safe.

44:18.692 --> 44:19.825
That's what you think.

44:19.826 --> 44:23.328
That toilet seat has not
been cleaned since VJ Day.

44:23.329 --> 44:26.197
I think George Washington
took a dump in there.

44:26.198 --> 44:29.601
Probably got scabies,
or eczema, or psoriasis.

44:29.602 --> 44:33.238
I never actually sat down here.
I just hovered the whole time but...

44:33.239 --> 44:35.006
Are you through?

44:35.007 --> 44:36.407
Yeah, I'm through.

44:36.408 --> 44:38.176
What's up?

44:38.177 --> 44:39.310
Cunningham wants to move.

44:39.311 --> 44:42.247
He figured between the ear
job and the weekly collections

44:42.248 --> 44:44.349
we got enough for
racketeering and conspiracy.

44:44.350 --> 44:46.017
That's weak, Lance.

44:46.018 --> 44:47.318
What do you got?

44:47.319 --> 44:50.955
I've got the Brotherhood
and the Mob in one shot.

44:50.956 --> 44:53.759
I'm going to need three
dozen drums of P2P.

44:53.760 --> 44:57.862
Transportation and an agent who's
got balls enough to pull it off.

44:57.863 --> 45:00.398
Yeah? Fries come with that shake?

45:00.399 --> 45:03.067
How about a witness
to close the case?

45:03.068 --> 45:06.560
- Who's your witness?
- Chains' old lady.

45:06.638 --> 45:10.835
I need a few days to nail
her down. But I'll get her.

45:34.199 --> 45:37.826
- Look at these two, bro.
- Toy soldiers.

45:39.938 --> 45:41.672
What's shaking, fellas?

45:41.673 --> 45:44.375
Mandatory registration
inspection. Statewide.

45:44.376 --> 45:47.744
- By order of District Attorney Whipperton.
- We need to see your papers.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.679
Boys, they want to see our papers.

45:51.817 --> 45:54.885
I got papers. How about these?

45:54.886 --> 45:58.321
Papers. You can use these.

45:58.589 --> 46:02.650
Look. It'll just take a minute.
Please let us do our job.

46:03.829 --> 46:05.818
I got a job for you.

46:08.232 --> 46:10.962
But it's a much more righteous job.

46:15.540 --> 46:17.803
Come on, let us out.

46:34.592 --> 46:38.528
It is better to be first in
hell than second in heaven.

46:38.529 --> 46:40.189
Please.

46:47.604 --> 46:51.708
Deliver them to fucking Whip.
Tell him it's a campaign contribution.

46:51.709 --> 46:53.043
You killed them.

46:53.044 --> 46:55.344
This is some shit, my brother!

46:55.345 --> 46:58.347
You killed them!
What kind of a maniac are you?

46:58.348 --> 47:03.309
Get this bitch out of my...
Turn her out. I need a new bitch.

47:03.387 --> 47:06.755
You know me, brother. I'll be
with you till the bitter end.

47:06.756 --> 47:09.656
Why don't you take one
of my old ladies?

47:13.598 --> 47:16.832
Hey, brothers, something
here ain't right.

47:16.833 --> 47:19.134
Shut your fucking mouth.

47:19.135 --> 47:21.804
- This ain't the Brotherhood that I joined.
- Shut up.

47:21.805 --> 47:24.000
Shut the fuck up!

47:25.275 --> 47:28.835
We ride together. We live together.

47:29.479 --> 47:32.209
We even die for one another.

47:32.983 --> 47:36.919
But killing in cold
blood, that ain't right.

47:38.054 --> 47:41.990
Chains, I think you're
way out of line, man.

47:42.225 --> 47:43.726
You do?

47:43.727 --> 47:45.326
He's got to go, brother.

47:45.327 --> 47:50.026
Okay, gutless Gut.
I suggest you get on your bike.

47:52.669 --> 47:54.500
Get on your bike.

47:54.504 --> 47:56.402
Start it up.

47:59.675 --> 48:01.768
This is my home, man.

48:06.982 --> 48:09.507
I didn't mean what I said.

48:13.790 --> 48:15.517
Open it.

48:53.162 --> 48:56.229
- I've been looking for you.
- Where've you been all day?

48:56.230 --> 48:58.391
What's the matter?

49:03.739 --> 49:06.968
- Chains killed them.
- Chains killed who?

49:07.141 --> 49:10.109
One minute it was a practical joke.

49:10.378 --> 49:13.973
And the next minute,
there's two guardsmen dead.

49:18.119 --> 49:20.382
You saw this happen?

49:20.955 --> 49:23.992
I should've split this
scene before it got weird.

49:23.993 --> 49:26.860
Before D-Day. Before Chains flipped.

49:26.861 --> 49:30.564
Wait a minute. What do you mean
"D-Day"? What's going on here?

49:30.565 --> 49:33.500
It's what Chains needs
all his money for.

49:33.501 --> 49:38.372
It's why he pushed his luck with the
Mob. It's why he went for your deal.

49:38.373 --> 49:43.003
- Do you know anything about it?
- No, I don't. I don't want to know.

49:43.011 --> 49:44.611
Why are you interested anyway?

49:44.612 --> 49:47.914
Because, Nancy, I want to know what
I'm getting myself involved with.

49:47.915 --> 49:50.440
I'm an outsider, remember.

49:51.252 --> 49:52.786
I'll tell you what.

49:52.787 --> 49:57.416
I'm getting out of here right now.
I got to get out of here.

49:59.327 --> 50:03.063
Before you go, remember your brand?

50:03.064 --> 50:07.260
GFBD. "God forgives,
Brotherhood doesn't."

50:07.734 --> 50:09.566
Come here.

50:09.971 --> 50:12.564
You can't leave this place.

50:13.174 --> 50:15.241
'Cause if you do,
you'll become the hunted.

50:15.242 --> 50:17.410
Who cares, Stone?

50:17.411 --> 50:21.814
Let him kill me. Let him try.
I'm gonna take my chances.

50:23.451 --> 50:25.551
Nancy, listen to me.

50:25.552 --> 50:28.850
I came to the Brotherhood
for one reason.

50:28.855 --> 50:31.653
To get what I want and get out.

50:34.362 --> 50:37.489
That's not to say that I
can't take you with me.

50:39.166 --> 50:42.897
You would do that?
You'd take me with you?

50:43.070 --> 50:45.538
If you play by my rules.

51:19.472 --> 51:20.940
Oh, my God.

51:20.941 --> 51:24.569
We're not sure what it is.
Stay back. Stay back.

51:55.808 --> 52:00.108
It's pretty terrible. Some of the
worst beatings you can imagine.

52:00.513 --> 52:02.447
He wasn't my real father.

52:02.448 --> 52:05.780
He was just a dick.
So I split that scene.

52:05.783 --> 52:09.587
I hitchhiked around from
here to there. Partied a lot.

52:09.588 --> 52:11.356
Made a little money when I had to.

52:11.357 --> 52:14.492
- Got into a lot of trouble?
- Got into a lot of trouble.

52:14.493 --> 52:16.493
Then I ran into the Brotherhood.

52:16.494 --> 52:20.331
They were really cool. They took me
in and made me feel like I belonged.

52:20.332 --> 52:23.535
You know, like a family.
No "please," no "thank you."

52:23.536 --> 52:27.493
None of that pole-up-your-ass
shit that I grew up with.

52:29.073 --> 52:31.804
Anyway, it's completely changed now.

52:36.748 --> 52:39.478
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

52:39.484 --> 52:42.681
I need to make a
phone call. Sit tight.

53:15.085 --> 53:17.421
So what's the problem?

53:17.422 --> 53:20.924
- I think you're off the hook, Joe.
- What're you talking about, Lance?

53:20.925 --> 53:23.360
Found two National Guardsmen
murdered last night.

53:23.361 --> 53:26.529
Cunningham thinks he made a mistake
by putting you under so soon.

53:26.530 --> 53:29.499
- A mistake?
- Yeah. He wants to re-evaluate.

53:29.500 --> 53:34.061
- I can't back out now. You know that.
- Sorry, Joe. I don't give the orders.

53:35.772 --> 53:37.899
Maybe you should.

53:38.075 --> 53:39.942
You tell Cunningham I'm staying.

53:39.943 --> 53:44.814
No, I can't. Joe, you're an Alabama cop.
Suddenly, you're out of your jurisdiction.

53:44.815 --> 53:48.818
- I'm seeing it through. I got no choice.
- Joe.

53:48.819 --> 53:51.116
Hey, Joe!

53:55.559 --> 53:58.493
I'll see you back at the compound!

54:00.631 --> 54:02.530
Let's dance!

54:08.905 --> 54:10.872
Come on, cop!

54:31.528 --> 54:33.017
Yeah!

54:45.141 --> 54:46.733
Fuck!

55:11.701 --> 55:13.532
Hi, there.

55:19.642 --> 55:21.632
Come on, Joe!

56:11.760 --> 56:13.751
Fuck you, cop.

56:40.789 --> 56:43.724
- Is Chains there?
- No, he isn't.

56:43.725 --> 56:47.921
Nancy, right?
This is Sharon in Biloxi.

56:48.096 --> 56:51.999
He asked me to check out a
prospect named John Stone.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.668
A friend here let me access the
mainframe. There's something funny.

56:55.669 --> 57:00.903
Stone's driver's license is cross-indexed
with a guy in Mobile named Joe Huff.

57:01.142 --> 57:04.372
Joe Huff. Got it?

57:05.078 --> 57:06.567
Yeah.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.904
Yeah, I got it.

57:12.420 --> 57:13.909
Fuck.

57:21.728 --> 57:23.855
Have a good time.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.502
- What's wrong?
- That was some disappearing act.

57:29.503 --> 57:31.571
- I had business.
- Business?

57:31.572 --> 57:35.041
John Stone business?
Or Joe Huff business?

57:35.042 --> 57:36.375
What are you talking about?

57:36.376 --> 57:41.314
A sister from the Highway Patrol.
She said the names are cross-referenced.

57:41.315 --> 57:43.612
So I got a few names.

57:43.617 --> 57:47.153
Look, Stone. There's a lot
of things I can accept.

57:47.154 --> 57:49.255
And there's even more I can ignore.

57:49.256 --> 57:53.852
Look at me, right at me,
and tell me you're not a cop.

57:57.697 --> 58:01.133
You're right, I'm a cop. Satisfied?

58:27.560 --> 58:30.995
- Hold it down, brothers!
- Shut the fuck up.

58:31.063 --> 58:34.900
I don't know what to say about Ice except
that he used to run his mouth a lot.

58:34.901 --> 58:36.902
- We all know that.
- Yeah!

58:36.903 --> 58:40.171
But we cut him slack.
Because he took care of business.

58:40.172 --> 58:43.368
Which is why we loved
him as a brother.

58:44.243 --> 58:48.372
If you tried to out-party him,
he'd leave you in the ozone.

58:53.019 --> 58:57.249
If you tried to out-ride him,
you'd crash and burn.

59:00.293 --> 59:01.660
If you tried to fight him,

59:01.661 --> 59:04.962
he'd cut your balls off and
give them to you on a plate.

59:04.963 --> 59:06.363
He was cold.

59:06.364 --> 59:09.458
So let's send this prick to Valhalla.

01:00:17.635 --> 01:00:20.035
So where the hell is he?

01:00:35.386 --> 01:00:38.688
- What's up, Cunningham?
- I'm getting a shit load of heat on this.

01:00:38.689 --> 01:00:41.090
You better know what you're doing.

01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:44.261
Sir, Joe's come this far. I've got
a good feeling about the sting.

01:00:44.262 --> 01:00:46.661
Can we talk about that?

01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:50.733
Chains and I will make the buy from
Martinez, down at the fish factory.

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:54.437
- You know the place?
- Yeah. I know where it's at.

01:00:54.438 --> 01:00:57.807
The buy goes down tomorrow night.
We get the truck from Martinez,

01:00:57.808 --> 01:01:00.877
we move the drugs down to North
Point where the Mob is gonna be.

01:01:00.878 --> 01:01:04.813
Then we'll get both the Mob
and the Brotherhood in the act.

01:01:07.685 --> 01:01:09.914
Don't fuck this up.

01:02:07.577 --> 01:02:09.476
You're late.

01:02:13.182 --> 01:02:14.483
I'm late.

01:02:14.484 --> 01:02:16.507
- Any problems?
- No.

01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:21.219
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:02:26.128 --> 01:02:28.220
You know, Stone,

01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:32.591
I've been thinking.
I've been getting $50,000

01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:35.928
for turning over $1 million.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.004
Let's take a walk. Chains.

01:02:53.389 --> 01:02:55.378
We had a deal.

01:03:00.562 --> 01:03:03.257
We had a non-negotiable deal.

01:03:03.365 --> 01:03:05.332
Yeah, well, Stone,

01:03:05.667 --> 01:03:08.795
everything is negotiable.

01:03:09.471 --> 01:03:11.336
Everything.

01:03:13.842 --> 01:03:16.640
I got my negotiator right here.

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:24.184
I'll check with my boss.

01:03:43.104 --> 01:03:46.128
I guess we decided not to negotiate.

01:03:55.716 --> 01:03:57.706
What happened?

01:03:57.785 --> 01:04:01.220
You follow them. Greek,
Mudfish, you ride escort.

01:05:17.063 --> 01:05:18.655
Damn.

01:05:24.405 --> 01:05:27.668
- I died good tonight.
- But you ruined the shirt.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.172
Hold this.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.847
- Hello.
- This is Checkpoint Two.

01:05:35.848 --> 01:05:39.806
They just turned south off
Highway 10. What's the deal?

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:47.116
Huff? It's Lance. Is everything okay?

01:05:50.063 --> 01:05:51.863
You're a cop.

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:54.161
You're a fucking pig!

01:05:54.967 --> 01:05:57.335
Good going, you just
said hello to my witness.

01:05:57.336 --> 01:06:00.639
You're fucking using me.
You're a fucking cop!

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:04.109
Look, when this deal
goes down, everyone burns.

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:06.043
Old ladies included.

01:06:06.044 --> 01:06:08.679
- Fuck yourself.
- Nancy, listen.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.850
If you cooperate, I can
guarantee you immunity.

01:06:11.851 --> 01:06:13.716
Relocation.

01:06:13.987 --> 01:06:16.920
But you're gonna have to trust me.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:01.665
What's going on, Chains?
I thought this was my deal.

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:04.929
- Why the switch?
- Time to crack the fucking Whip.

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:08.438
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

01:07:08.439 --> 01:07:12.467
It doesn't matter where.
This is how I do business.

01:07:13.578 --> 01:07:16.443
Fine. We'll settle up later.

01:07:17.915 --> 01:07:20.042
Get off my horse.

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.704
I'll get back to you.

01:08:01.492 --> 01:08:04.187
Joe, what happened out there?

01:08:06.696 --> 01:08:10.533
Chains pulled a switch on me.
The deal happened at another location.

01:08:10.534 --> 01:08:14.170
Terrific. So we got $1 million
of P2P out on the street?

01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:15.838
As if that wasn't enough,

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:19.608
I overheard one of the brothers
say they're gonna crack the Whip.

01:08:19.609 --> 01:08:21.511
- As in Whipperton?
- Yeah.

01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:25.581
- We just dropped a dime on your boy.
- You better call Cunningham.

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:27.015
Shit!

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:28.716
I got to stop that truck.

01:08:28.718 --> 01:08:31.319
You can't go back. They must
be on to you by now, Joe.

01:08:31.321 --> 01:08:36.314
If they were, I'd be dead by now.
Look, Lance, there's a time to turn it on.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.484
- Pull it over.
- Fuck you!

01:09:27.643 --> 01:09:29.906
The trailer's loose.

01:09:47.662 --> 01:09:52.292
Here you go. $200,000 for the weapons.
$50,000 for the chopper.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.836
Be back at 2200 sharp,
or we're both in deep shit.

01:09:55.837 --> 01:09:58.439
Rest easy. It'll be
just like old times.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.205
I can fly this baby faster
than anyone on the base.

01:10:23.498 --> 01:10:27.728
Stone, where you been?
Been a long day or what?

01:10:28.603 --> 01:10:30.638
What's going on?

01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:34.938
Loosen up a little bit. Come on,
Chains wants to see you.

01:10:42.618 --> 01:10:44.107
Hey, man.

01:10:44.219 --> 01:10:47.050
We're having a little
going-away party.

01:10:53.128 --> 01:10:55.117
Glad you could make it.

01:10:57.431 --> 01:11:00.422
- Who's leaving?
- You are.

01:11:06.374 --> 01:11:08.865
Betrayal is a bitch.

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:11.538
A bitch.

01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:23.917
Hola, amigo.

01:11:25.725 --> 01:11:27.852
Long time no see.

01:11:31.465 --> 01:11:33.296
CÃ³mo estÃ¡s, my friend?

01:11:35.835 --> 01:11:40.363
I told you, don't fuck with me.

01:11:42.143 --> 01:11:44.372
And what do you do?

01:11:44.844 --> 01:11:49.542
You remember? What goes
around comes around.

01:12:05.498 --> 01:12:08.626
God forgives,
the Brotherhood doesn't.

01:12:12.672 --> 01:12:14.106
So what?

01:12:14.107 --> 01:12:17.009
Are you asking for my
undying devotion now?

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:20.536
No, Joe Huff.

01:12:22.382 --> 01:12:24.974
I want to break your heart.

01:12:26.786 --> 01:12:28.548
You fuck!

01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:44.865
You know they say that the
devil was a rebel angel.

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.170
So they kicked him out of heaven.

01:12:49.842 --> 01:12:52.573
If you wanna fuck with the living,

01:12:53.113 --> 01:12:56.308
you got to learn to
fuck with the dead.

01:12:58.984 --> 01:13:01.384
The Whip dies tomorrow.

01:13:09.728 --> 01:13:12.628
I guess you're gonna be my angel.

01:13:20.038 --> 01:13:22.340
The State Capitol
courthouse is the setting

01:13:22.341 --> 01:13:26.978
for today's controversial re-sentencing
of convicted murderer Trouble Owens.

01:13:26.979 --> 01:13:29.981
A sworn member of the biker
gang known as the Brotherhood,

01:13:29.982 --> 01:13:34.385
Owens was found guilty of brutally
gunning down a Baptist minister.

01:13:34.386 --> 01:13:37.422
Security is extremely tight
here at the courthouse.

01:13:37.423 --> 01:13:40.892
National Guardsmen can be
seen posted everywhere.

01:13:40.893 --> 01:13:44.728
District Attorney Whipperton,
following up on his anti-crime claims

01:13:44.729 --> 01:13:48.131
as candidate for Governor has
pressed hard for the death penalty.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.767
Whipperton has spear-headed
the Persecution's appeal...

01:13:49.768 --> 01:13:52.637
One-Eye. Poker.

01:13:52.638 --> 01:13:54.571
... saying that the original
sentence of 45 years...

01:13:54.572 --> 01:13:55.872
Greek.

01:13:55.873 --> 01:13:57.674
... without possibility of
parole is far too lenient.

01:13:57.675 --> 01:13:59.369
Leroy.

01:14:00.678 --> 01:14:02.669
What about me?

01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:06.650
You're going to be famous, Stone.

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:11.554
We're going to blow your
ass all over the sky.

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:16.824
You're gonna make a perfect
little diversion for D-Day.

01:14:28.706 --> 01:14:32.403
Form two lines, please. Two lines.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.447
Step over here.

01:14:37.448 --> 01:14:39.416
Step over here, ma'am.

01:14:39.417 --> 01:14:42.147
Thank you. Next.

01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:45.688
Go in, sir. Thank you.

01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:48.158
Hi, Father. How are you?

01:14:50.828 --> 01:14:53.455
Go inside, Father. Go right ahead.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:58.061
- Morning.
- Father.

01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.516
Mr. Martinez.

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:31.223
All rise.

01:15:31.368 --> 01:15:35.237
The Supreme Court of the State
of Mississippi is now in session.

01:15:35.238 --> 01:15:39.196
The Honorable Supreme Court
Justice Townsend presiding.

01:15:40.143 --> 01:15:44.712
The prosecution's appeal will be heard
from District Attorney Whipperton

01:15:44.713 --> 01:15:47.416
representing the people of
the State of Mississippi

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:51.045
versus the defendant, Trouble Owens.

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:54.283
This court is now in session.

01:15:56.825 --> 01:16:00.229
This will show those
bastards who's in charge.

01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:03.631
First the courthouse.
Next, the White House!

01:16:04.067 --> 01:16:07.364
These pigs won't even
know what hit them!

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:13.075
The Brotherhood must
be sent a clear signal

01:16:13.076 --> 01:16:18.137
that the State of Mississippi will not
tolerate this assault on society.

01:16:20.249 --> 01:16:22.418
When this ticker hits 20,

01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:26.319
we're going to strap it
on and boot your ass out.

01:16:36.632 --> 01:16:40.234
Having reviewed the record
of the lower court,

01:16:40.235 --> 01:16:44.568
which is overwhelming in its
evidence against the defendant,

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.875
my colleagues and I have
come to the conclusion

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:51.504
that a more severe
sentence is called for.

01:17:08.397 --> 01:17:10.999
Time for your flying lesson, piglet.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.832
Bombs away! Strap it on him.

01:17:33.422 --> 01:17:35.912
Get the bomb out of here!

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.493
Sorry, sir. Got to inspect your load.

01:17:57.912 --> 01:18:03.315
This court sentences the defendant
to die of lethal injection.

01:18:12.393 --> 01:18:13.493
What was that?

01:18:13.494 --> 01:18:16.427
This time it's for real, asshole.

01:18:20.268 --> 01:18:22.030
Take it down, A.W.O.L.

01:18:46.026 --> 01:18:47.857
Hey, Whip!

01:18:59.973 --> 01:19:01.667
Please.

01:19:11.284 --> 01:19:15.086
You know, at a moment like this
I think of my father's last words.

01:19:15.087 --> 01:19:18.648
Which were, "Don't, son.
That gun is loaded."

01:19:21.862 --> 01:19:24.955
Gunshots, outside the Records Office.

01:19:42.382 --> 01:19:43.816
- Take it down.
- You want down?

01:19:43.817 --> 01:19:46.580
Shit. You got down.

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:07.135
Down! Everybody down!

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:12.975
Pull it up.

01:20:15.246 --> 01:20:17.612
That's Joe! It's Joe!

01:20:19.885 --> 01:20:21.875
Rock and roll.

01:20:25.456 --> 01:20:28.626
We've got hostages and
we own every exit.

01:20:28.627 --> 01:20:32.858
Make one move toward this
building and Mississippi burns!

01:20:33.199 --> 01:20:35.893
The Whip is cracked. Come on.

01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:39.938
Six Pack, the whole hall
of hostages is yours.

01:20:39.939 --> 01:20:42.566
We're out of here. Let's go.

01:20:51.283 --> 01:20:52.917
We're out of here. Pick us up.

01:20:52.918 --> 01:20:55.214
- Mayday, Chains.
- Shut up.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.389
Guess who, buddy? Angels don't die.

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:02.381
Everybody bail. You're on your own.

01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:07.425
Get them up! Fuck! Nobody move.
Don't nobody move.

01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:15.431
If you try to block our
escape, we'll kill them all!

01:22:15.432 --> 01:22:17.133
No more bullshit!

01:22:17.134 --> 01:22:19.192
Someone's coming!

01:22:24.074 --> 01:22:25.875
Mudfish, what are you doing?

01:22:25.876 --> 01:22:28.711
I'm telling you now, will you
just shut up, you little punk?

01:22:28.712 --> 01:22:30.646
You're going too far.
This ain't right.

01:22:30.647 --> 01:22:33.547
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:38.754
Don't send in any more guards!
What did I fucking tell you?

01:22:38.755 --> 01:22:43.326
I'll fucking carve out her liver and
spit it at you, you motherfuckers!

01:22:43.327 --> 01:22:45.794
What the hell's wrong
with you people?

01:22:45.795 --> 01:22:50.130
Anyone comes near the building,
everybody here is going straight to hell!

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.436
You just lost one of
Mississippi's finest.

01:22:53.437 --> 01:22:57.238
We're not fucking around!
Now pull your people back!

01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:59.764
I'm not telling you again!

01:23:13.557 --> 01:23:15.318
Die, pig.

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:29.326
Time to fly, ASAP.
It's getting a little bumpy up here.

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.908
Take the fucker out.

01:23:57.665 --> 01:23:59.827
Die, motherfucker!

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.532
No!

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.791
Welcome to my slaughterhouse.

01:25:04.698 --> 01:25:06.927
You son of a bitch!

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.006
You're dead.

01:26:21.575 --> 01:26:24.270
Imagine the future, Chains,

01:26:25.044 --> 01:26:27.512
'cause you're not in it.

01:27:00.546 --> 01:27:02.536
Let's have it.

01:27:10.022 --> 01:27:12.285
It's all over, Huff.

01:27:32.278 --> 01:27:34.302
Hey, partner.

01:27:35.714 --> 01:27:38.182
It's time to turn it on.
