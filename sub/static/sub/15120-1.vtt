The very second I open
my eyes each morning,

24:05.640 --> 24:09.804

24:15.040 --> 24:17.122
But I'm on the back foot now

24:17.200 --> 24:18.964
because of all the infinite variables of chaos

24:19.040 --> 24:22.567
that I pondered this morning,
the one that never crossed my mind

24:22.640 --> 24:24.802
was that you'd be standing in front of me.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.283
An explanation would be good.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.649

24:31.720 --> 24:33.961

24:43.360 --> 24:45.044
I thought you were dead.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.205
SAM: Guess not.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.565
You disappeared without a trace
for over a year.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.526
I've had daily signals placed in
24 newspapers for the last six months

24:55.840 --> 24:57.888

24:58.600 --> 24:59.726
DEACON: Where did you go?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.165
Sightseeing.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.890
-"Sightseeing?"
- Mmm.

25:03.160 --> 25:07.245
I was tired, I needed a change of scenery.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.524
I'd be happy to take a polygraph.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.045
You can beat a polygraph.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.604

still trust me, you can.

did you think about that?

25:30.360 --> 25:32.601
Did you think about
the chaos you unleashed?

25:32.680 --> 25:33.920
Do I get my job back?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.166

27:19.880 --> 27:22.531
Okay, target is Jack Turner,

27:22.600 --> 27:24.011
he worked the docks mid-to-late seven...

27:24.120 --> 27:25.326
Sorry I'm late.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.365
You're back.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.561

27:33.800 --> 27:35.370

27:37.920 --> 27:39.251
DEACON: Zoe.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.721
As I was saying, Jack Turner.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.531
He worked the docks
in the mid-to-late seventies.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.120
Extortion, blackmail. You name it.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.965
Then after they shut down,
he went into property,

27:50.040 --> 27:51.963
He made a killing on the Docklands.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.444
He obviously upset a few people
because in 1996

27:55.520 --> 27:58.603
his eldest son, John,
was found murdered and mutilated.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.289
Jack played the markets shrewdly

28:01.360 --> 28:04.330
and now runs his investments
out of a town house off Regent's Park

28:04.400 --> 28:06.402
Personal wealth in excess of £300 million.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.527
(WHISTLES) Blimey

28:07.600 --> 28:11.127
There are questions regarding how
Mr Turner accumulated his wealth.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.690
Some of his business associates
have disappeared or turned up dead'

28:16.000 --> 28:19.209
ZOE: Mr Turner is currently bidding to
acquire the Upper Khyber Dam.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.248
It's a billion-pound hydroelectric facility.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.646
The Pakistani Minister for Privatization is
auctioning it off to the highest bidder,

28:25.720 --> 28:27.484
against fierce political opposition.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.007
There's a presidential candidate,
Fatima Zahir,

28:30.760 --> 28:34.401
she's vowed to block the sale
if she wins the election next month.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.411
A billion-pound utility seems
a bit out of Mr Turner's league

28:37.720 --> 28:39.484
He's staking his entire fortune on it.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.804
So he'll use all his old tricks
to ensure he wins.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.321
And our client wants us to ensure
that he loses.

28:45.520 --> 28:50.526
Yeah. But not until we find out
what Mr Turners game really is'

28:50.600 --> 28:52.568
The agenda behind the agenda.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.367
- What's our play?
- Sam will be the draw.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.926
And the target?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.480
Stephen Tumer, Jack's surviving son.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.403
Stephen's public-school educated,
he's a lawyer,

29:03.760 --> 29:07.048
widowed with a young son, Edward, aged 10.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.810
They live in the Regent's Park house
with Jack.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.091
What happened to the mother?

29:14.160 --> 29:15.525
Suicide, last year.

29:16.320 --> 29:20.530
Jack Turner is controlling and aggressive.
It won't be easy getting to Stephen.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.284
Or giving him a reason to trust you.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.600
I assume you have a plan.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.524
Study the files. We have a lot of prep
and not a lot of time.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.968
- Good job, Zoe.
- Thanks.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.451
You <i>good?</i>

30:42.800 --> 30:44.609

30:51.960 --> 30:53.450

30:54.200 --> 30:56.043
You've seen it, You can go now.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.406
I knew you'd come back, Sam.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.645
You couldn't stay away.
Even if it meant they'd try killing you again'

31:00.720 --> 31:01.960
How did you know anyone did?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.691
- Sam, that cafe was a bloodbath.
- Is that what you told Keel?

31:04.960 --> 31:07.566
Keel doesn't know. Or at least I didn't tell him.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.881
Why not?

31:08.960 --> 31:12.248
I figured if you didn't report in,
you must have your reasons,

31:12.960 --> 31:14.291
How did you know I wasn't dead?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.490
I saw your footprint.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.450
Not a pulse in the place.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.321
Sam, what happened?

31:33.400 --> 31:35.323
- I was set up.
- By who?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.891
You think it was me?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.810
No one knew else knew where I'd be.
Only you.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.328
Okay. I can see that.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.648
I might even think the same thing.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.484
Except that it's me you're talking about, Sam.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.081
Right. So someone else found out
where I'd be...

31:55.160 --> 31:56.605
That's right, They must have.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.125
- How?
- I don't know.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.928
Not a pulse in the place.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.522
The bartender was alive when I left.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.126
<i>AIDAN: Oh, he was most definitely dead.</i>

32:16.680 --> 32:18.682
Someone was sent to clean up.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.084
Son of thing you're good at.

32:21.160 --> 32:22.446
Okay,

32:22.880 --> 32:25.360
since you've got it all worked out
let's say, "Yes,

32:25.800 --> 32:27.040
"I did order a hit on you."

32:27.840 --> 32:30.161
I couldn't go the normal route of
"It's not working out between us,

32:30.240 --> 32:32.004
"we both want different things,
it's not you, it's me."

32:32.080 --> 32:34.890
No, let's go for assassination instead.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.644
But why would I want to kill my own child?

32:43.960 --> 32:46.122
I knew what you wanted to talk to me
about, Sam.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.249
I knew every tiny little inch of you.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.683
You think I hadn't noticed?

32:53.280 --> 32:54.725
I knew,

33:00.040 --> 33:01.246
Did, uh...

33:01.880 --> 33:03.086
Did you?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.164
That answer your question?

33:14.600 --> 33:18.969
For God's sake, Sam.
You can't think that this was down to me.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.447
Why would I want to do that to you?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.081
We were in love.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.125
We were.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.649
So you want to find out
who tried to kill you and why.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.768
And you think the best way of doing that
is to let them try again.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.725
So you come back.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.920
I mean, you had to, sooner or later.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.530
But ask yourself this.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.410
Why won't you trust me?

33:49.920 --> 33:52.127
Is it because you don't love me anymore?

33:54.080 --> 33:56.128
Or is it because you're afraid you still do?

35:12.400 --> 35:14.846

Can I go and get some proper milk?

52:32.920 --> 52:35.400
No. Nobody leaves
unless specifically ordered'

52:35.960 --> 52:37.086
Fine.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.809
So did you talk to her?

52:41.240 --> 52:44.050
Did she tell you anything?
About where she'd been? Anything at all?

52:44.520 --> 52:45.885
Why would she talk to me?

52:45.960 --> 52:47.883
Well, you're a woman.
You tell each other things'

52:48.360 --> 52:49.930
I'm <i>a</i> woman?

52:50.400 --> 52:53.085
Shit, man! I wondered what these
were doing here!

52:54.080 --> 52:55.161
- Funny.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.404
So once round thorough check

53:04.480 --> 53:07.051
and I want you phoning in
no later than 4:00, all right?

53:43.160 --> 53:44.286
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

53:54.800 --> 53:55.961
BINGHAM : Sir.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.246
The KPEK documents have just arrived.
Your father would like you to review them'

54:00.320 --> 54:01.526
STEPHEN: Okay,

54:13.760 --> 54:14.841
And we're up.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.527
- She's good all right.
- Yeah.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.005
Goebel's arriving on a Lufthansa ﬂight
into City in 45 minutes'

54:25.400 --> 54:28.210
All right. Hasan, I want you to go to
City Airport and watch for Goebel.

54:28.600 --> 54:29.761
Why can't Fowkes go?

54:29.840 --> 54:30.921
'Cause I'm ordering you.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.569
How am I supposed to recognise him?

54:36.960 --> 54:39.531
I'll send you his SIM data.
Just track him when he comes online.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.447
Hasan, nip in the shop
and pick us up a few things'

54:44.880 --> 54:46.211
Good lad.

54:47.720 --> 54:49.449
(MOBILE RINGING)

54:54.760 --> 54:55.966
Yes.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.171
That's right.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.566
Where?

55:04.160 --> 55:05.730
Who is this?

55:07.280 --> 55:08.486
(KNOCKING on DOOR)

55:09.920 --> 55:11.126
Sir,

55:11.600 --> 55:12.761
What is it, Bingham?

55:12.840 --> 55:14.410
I have some good news.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.929
Shit, scramblers are killing the audio.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.240
(DISTORTED SPEECH)

55:23.760 --> 55:25.410
Well, something's going on.

55:34.920 --> 55:36.410
Are you ready for bed?

55:38.920 --> 55:40.684
Would you like me to read you a story'?

55:41.160 --> 55:43.083
My mummy read them all to me.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.086
She's not alive any more.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.050
I know. I'm sorry.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.888
Dad says you had a family.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.520
I did.

55:57.480 --> 55:58.686
They died, too.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.965
They did.

56:12.240 --> 56:15.801
You know tomorrow?
For your breakfast, we have every cereal'

56:15.880 --> 56:18.326
And whatever's your favourite,
we probably have it.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.526
And if we don't,
Mrs Sidwa could go get it for you

56:23.040 --> 56:24.485
I like most things.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.485
But I tell you what,

56:26.560 --> 56:28.324
I'll have the same thing as you.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.411
Okay.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.730
See you tomorrow morning.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.325
Good night, Eddie.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.800
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bed bugs bile'

57:08.680 --> 57:10.011
Come on!

57:23.160 --> 57:24.844
- Is Eddie sleeping?
- Yeah.

57:24.960 --> 57:27.531
Good. Thank you again.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.286
Here's to you, Miss Kent.

57:32.360 --> 57:33.566
Call me Alex.

57:35.200 --> 57:36.361
Alex.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.443
Mr Tumer? He's arrived.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.369
Thank you. I won't be a second.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.611
STEPHEN: Doctor,
so pleased you could make it.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.365
- How was your trip?
- Oh, it was fine, thank you'

57:52.440 --> 57:55.011
Miss Kent, this is Dr Horst Goebel.
