00:10.745 --> 00:12.478
<i>I think about</i>
<i>the day you were born,</i>

00:19.553 --> 00:21.487
<i>Not when I first</i>
<i>laid eyes on you.</i>

00:24.392 --> 00:26.225
<i>When you first</i>
<i>opened your eyes.</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:32.398
<i>And when you closed them</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:35.501
<i>the last time.</i>

00:37.705 --> 00:41.373
So when do they start providing alcohol at kids' birthday parties?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.628
Okay, sure.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.713
- I guess I'll drive.
- I mean, they had adult brownies.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.181
What's in--

00:49.183 --> 00:50.966
You know, I used to try
to do anything to get out

00:50.967 --> 00:52.750
of the birthday
parties, you know.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.487
- Did you all have fun?
- All right. Everyone set?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.423
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:57.425 --> 01:01.260
- Did you-- did you take your pill?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:01.796 --> 01:03.562
- You need a cup of coffee?
- No.

01:04.065 --> 01:04.797
All right.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.332
- Let's hit it.
- Okay.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.502
Cassie, please stop.
Get in the car.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.672
They have no ser-- I told you
to take Riverton Drive.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.040
I'm trying to figure
it out right now.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.407
- We're stuck in the middle of nowhere.
- Why are you yelling at me?

01:16.408 --> 01:17.774
I'm trying to figure
it out right now.

01:17.775 --> 01:19.141
- What am I going to do?
- Go get him a bottle.

01:19.146 --> 01:19.845
I need you to go get him a bottle.
He's going to wake up.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.716
<i>Now I never</i>
<i>want to close my eyes.</i>

01:27.655 --> 01:29.221
I never should have
closed my eyes.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.627
<i>Danni, wake up!</i>
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

01:52.713 --> 01:54.880
I can save him.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.815
I can save him!

02:13.601 --> 02:14.833
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:20.305
I'm so sorry.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.175
¶¶¶

03:07.388 --> 03:10.422
Okay. Do you have to do that
now? While I'm driving?

03:11.825 --> 03:13.258
Cass!

03:13.928 --> 03:15.527
When's dad coming home?

03:17.464 --> 03:18.764
Um...

03:20.968 --> 03:23.735
- What's today?
- Tuesday.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.444
Sorry.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.713
I don't feel well.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.882
- Does this sound that bad?
- No.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.985
No. It's not that.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.922
- You okay to drive?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.324
- You don't look fine.
- I'm fine.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.625
Okay.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.673
¶¶¶

05:29.063 --> 05:30.829
Can you grab that
last bag, please?

06:08.135 --> 06:11.636
Have you seen the bag of fruits where there were like six peaches?

06:11.638 --> 06:12.537
Nah.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.843
I'm losing it.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.499
Come on, Danni.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.062
<i>¶ Cuddle up a little closer ¶</i>

07:11.064 --> 07:15.167
<i>¶ Lovely mine ¶</i>

07:15.169 --> 07:20.038
<i>¶ Cuddle up and be my little ¶</i>

07:20.040 --> 07:24.142
<i>¶ Clinging vine ¶</i>

07:24.144 --> 07:28.914
<i>¶ Like to feel</i>
<i>Your cheek so rosy ¶</i>

07:28.916 --> 07:33.652

<i>¶ 'Cause I love</i>
<i>From head to toesie ¶</i>

07:37.724 --> 07:40.525
<i>Alice, there's something else I have to tell you.</i>

07:40.527 --> 07:43.495
<i>You've told me everything you have to for now, darling.</i>

07:43.497 --> 07:44.796
<i>You're coming home.</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:45.864
<i>Pack up your bags.</i>

08:05.118 --> 08:08.887
<i>Hey, I mean praying's for church, huh?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

08:09.790 --> 08:12.090
<i>I haven't</i>
<i>seen you in church lately.</i>

08:12.092 --> 08:16.828
<i>Well, there's not much sense in my going to church.</i>

08:22.002 --> 08:24.486
<i>Over there.</i>

08:24.487 --> 08:26.971
<i>I jumped out at you from behind a tree,</i>
<i>and grandpa got all excited and he shook</i>

08:26.974 --> 08:29.808
<i>his fist at me and he said,</i>
<i>"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."</i>

08:30.878 --> 08:32.844
<i>Remember that?</i>
<i>Right over there.</i>

08:33.780 --> 08:35.614
<i>Boy, we used to be</i>
<i>really scared here.</i>

08:36.616 --> 08:37.816
<i>Johnny.</i>

08:38.217 --> 08:39.751
<i>Well, you're still afraid.</i>

08:39.753 --> 08:41.620
<i>Stop it now! I mean it!</i>

08:45.726 --> 08:48.894
<i>They're coming to</i>
<i>get you, Barbara.</i>

08:48.896 --> 08:50.729
<i>Stop it.</i>

08:50.731 --> 08:51.897
<i>You're ignorant.</i>

08:51.899 --> 08:54.065
<i>They're coming for you, Barbara.</i>

08:54.067 --> 08:57.202
<i>Stop it.</i>
<i>You're acting like a child.</i>

08:57.204 --> 08:58.904
<i>They're</i>
<i>coming for you.</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:00.789
<i>Look.</i>

09:00.790 --> 09:01.939
<i>Here comes one of them now.</i>

11:25.886 --> 11:27.318
Oh, damn it.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.391
Do you know
where my black tie is?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.462
I don't know when the last
time I wore the damn thing.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.399
In my boots maybe.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.306
Yeah.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.245
You look good, babe.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.217
Hey. Hey.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.286
Come here. Come here.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.123
This is what we're
supposed to do, right?

12:06.793 --> 12:07.492
Yeah.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.204
Okay.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.306
Hey, you guys.
Thanks for coming.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.743
Yeah. We're just getting ready.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.297
<i>Answer me.</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:52.096
<i>Look.</i>

13:52.098 --> 13:53.231
<i>Look.</i>

13:53.233 --> 13:54.232
<i>Look.</i>

13:54.234 --> 13:56.134
<i>You're gonna fucking die.</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:22.894
¶¶¶

14:43.383 --> 14:46.150
<i>Danni, wake up!</i>
<i>Wake up! Danni, wake up!</i>

16:28.188 --> 16:29.454
Oh.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.636
Yeah. That sounds fun.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.239
I wish.

17:24.077 --> 17:27.512
- Cass, who are you on the phone with?
- I'll call you back.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.647
I asked you a question.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.715
Okay, bye.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.055
You're going to make
me ask you again?

17:38.324 --> 17:40.158
Just a girl from school.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.060
She's transferring
to the valley.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.628
Her parents are
getting divorced.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.230
That's terrible.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.770
I think I woke up
a bit too early.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.272
I'm still tired.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.306
Okay.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.743
- Did you eat enough?
- I'm tired.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.745
Okay.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.216
Cass.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.684
Yeah?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.754
Did you hear
anything last night?

18:11.357 --> 18:12.457
No, like what?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.661
- Anything weird?
- No.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.796
Okay.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.099
See you when you wake up.

18:21.101 --> 18:21.799
Bye.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.491
It's going to be okay.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.194
Do you hear me? And don't
you even worry about work.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.762
Sarah's got you covered.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.699
We can get as many
extensions as we need.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.270
Do you need anything else?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.741
Let's go. Get a cup
of coffee or something.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.688
Get out of my house.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.590
Danni. Danni, come
here. You're upset.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.210
- I'll make you some--
- Get off me.

19:22.211 --> 19:24.829
Hey! This is my house too. All right?
Don't make a scene in front of all these people.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.198
I don't give a shit
about these people.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.566
Do they know how I feel? Do
they actually care? Do you care?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.336
- Do you actually care?
- Of course, I care!

19:32.338 --> 19:33.804
Girl, come with me.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.773
I'm sorry.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.817
Everyone out.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.687
Get the fuck out of my house!

19:50.557 --> 19:51.889
Get out!

19:53.226 --> 19:54.692
You did this.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.462
Sorry.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.608
Hey.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.776
What are you doing?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.012
Um...

20:49.916 --> 20:52.817
I'm just checking out
your cool setup here.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.619
Okay.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.788
- What's it for?
- My safe house.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.361
Why do you feel you
need a safe house?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.764
- You don't feel safe at home?
- I don't know.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.434
Sometimes I like to be alone,
or when I walk during my sleep.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.304
I sometimes end up out here.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.573
How often does that happen?

21:16.376 --> 21:19.477
I've been keeping track.
When I wear the face,

21:19.479 --> 21:22.280
all the bad stuff
seems to stay away.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.582
It's hard wearing it
all the time, though.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.350
Maybe you can make me one.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.920
I could use some help
keeping the bad stuff away.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.025
So, what sounds good to eat?

21:34.027 --> 21:38.896
We could get something
delivered or we could go out.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.900
When was the last time we did that, huh?
I could use a good excuse to shave.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.768
Look at that.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.503
Not that hungry.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.905
Come on, Cass, you
got to eat something.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.573
I'm okay really.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.313
Okay.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.749
All right.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.354
So what are you saying?

24:00.355 --> 24:02.005
Just saying you guys
should get a hotel tonight.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.475
<i>What about Cassie?</i>

24:06.012 --> 24:07.845
I'll get some more clothes.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.613
Tomorrow's Friday, right?

24:09.615 --> 24:12.817
Maybe I can pick her up.
She can spend the weekend with me.

24:16.856 --> 24:17.888
Or not.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.025
You know this is still
your home, right?

24:21.027 --> 24:23.461
I do want see her
sometime soon, okay?

24:25.097 --> 24:26.130
I mean,

24:26.132 --> 24:30.201
actually I got to head up north for work in a couple of days.
Quick trip.

24:30.203 --> 24:32.169
Close a couple of contract.
Maybe she can tag along.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.205
I'm just saying you
still have a key.

24:34.207 --> 24:37.241
I just don't understand
wasting money on a hotel.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.710
<i>I'm not the one</i>
<i>who's doing this.</i>

24:39.712 --> 24:42.079
You asked me to leave, remember?

24:44.884 --> 24:46.050
I just-

24:48.788 --> 24:50.955
I just need some
time, okay? I-- I--

24:52.225 --> 24:53.824
reorganize my brain.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.560
<i>We can figure this out.</i>

24:58.164 --> 24:59.196
Okay.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.068
<i>Danni, wait, wait, wait.</i>

25:04.070 --> 25:06.737
I have-- I have to finish
cleaning up, so.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.607
Look, I'm sorry.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.574
Hey, it's-

25:12.278 --> 25:16.814
this is just going to get better.
I just-- after everything-

25:17.984 --> 25:20.117
I can forgive you, Michael.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.752
I have.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.856
I'm trying to let it go. Why
can't you do the same?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.062
I'll talk to you later, okay?

25:37.870 --> 25:38.903
Fuck.

26:18.811 --> 26:22.646
<i>In actuality, we all experience</i>
<i>a few common ones from the list.</i>

26:22.648 --> 26:25.716
<i>People fall asleep and wake up</i>
<i>in random parts of their home.</i>

26:26.052 --> 26:28.052
<i>They fall asleep at the</i>
<i>wheel while driving.</i>

26:28.654 --> 26:30.888
<i>For those who are</i>
<i>an narcoleptic of course.</i>

26:30.890 --> 26:32.823
<i>Take sleep paralysis,</i>
<i>for instance.</i>

26:32.825 --> 26:37.695
<i>People claim to see these intruders in</i>
<i>their home where they feel defenseless.</i>

26:37.697 --> 26:42.766
<i>Someone of the more religious patients believe</i>
<i>it's an apparition or something demonic.</i>

26:43.235 --> 26:48.205
<i>But most of the time it is because you are still half asleep.</i>

26:48.207 --> 26:51.609
<i>Grief is a very, very</i>
<i>powerful emotion.</i>

26:52.612 --> 26:56.213
<i>Most humans don't take</i>
<i>the time to go through it.</i>

27:17.203 --> 27:19.036
¶¶¶

27:25.411 --> 27:30.981
<i>¶ Some days you feel like</i>
<i>No one gives you a chance ¶</i>

28:52.998 --> 28:54.765
Please! No!

29:10.950 --> 29:12.049
Help me!

29:23.028 --> 29:29.133
Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die!

29:34.073 --> 29:35.272
Cassie!

31:36.962 --> 31:38.095
Oh! God.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.364
I thought you were sleeping.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.066
- Did you open this?
- No, why would I?

31:43.969 --> 31:46.036
I swear I locked every window.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.607
You feeling okay?
You seem a bit warm.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.309
Yeah. Fine.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.610
Just need some water.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.520
Morning.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.259
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

33:49.261 --> 33:53.497
<i>Die! Die! Die! Die!</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:02.439
<i>But if he's not here,</i>
<i>who will take care of me?</i>

34:06.345 --> 34:07.110
<i>No.</i>

34:08.347 --> 34:09.545
<i>No.</i>

34:10.416 --> 34:11.614
<i>Yes.</i>

34:13.318 --> 34:14.717
<i>You can't do that.</i>

34:15.286 --> 34:17.054
<i>Why not?</i>

34:18.056 --> 34:20.456
<i>Because</i>
<i>it wouldn't be right.</i>

34:21.293 --> 34:24.226
<i>Yes, it would.</i>

34:24.228 --> 34:27.130
<i>I'm not going to</i>
<i>do that. It wasn't her fault.</i>

34:28.600 --> 34:30.434
<i>She was there.</i>

34:31.469 --> 34:34.137
<i>She allowed it to happen.</i>

34:35.507 --> 34:37.574
<i>She couldn't do</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

34:38.143 --> 34:40.310
<i>But you can.</i>

34:40.646 --> 34:46.083
<i>You can do something</i>
<i>about it now.</i>

34:47.319 --> 34:50.353
<i>- Aren't you angry?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

34:50.355 --> 34:53.223
<i>Aren't you mad? Get out.</i>

34:53.659 --> 34:55.692
<i>Get out and fucking</i>
<i>die. Get out.</i>

34:55.694 --> 34:57.227
<i>Get out. Get out!</i>

34:57.229 --> 34:59.429
<i>Shut up</i>
<i>and leave me alone.</i>

34:59.798 --> 35:02.632
<i>Get out.</i>
<i>Get out and destroy her.</i>

35:02.634 --> 35:04.267
<i>Destroy her family.</i>

35:04.269 --> 35:06.636
<i>Go and fucking</i>
<i>kill her. Get out.</i>

35:07.306 --> 35:08.605
<i>You punk.</i>

35:08.607 --> 35:10.440
<i>Fucking whore.</i>

35:10.809 --> 35:12.709
Is that my phone?

35:12.711 --> 35:15.579
Cassie, what's going on?
Why are you filming these?

35:15.581 --> 35:17.381
Give me my phone, please?

35:17.382 --> 35:19.182
Who are you talking to?
You're scaring me.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.018
I said give me my phone!

35:21.019 --> 35:22.853
- Who are you speaking to?
- I don't know!

35:22.855 --> 35:25.122
Are you on the phone?
Is it someone from school?

35:25.124 --> 35:26.590
Are-- are you talking
to yourself?

35:26.592 --> 35:29.292
- I said I don't fucking know. Okay?
- Cassie!

36:48.307 --> 36:49.506
Hey.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.879
So, what's up?

36:58.684 --> 37:04.854
I don't know if I'm losing my mind or
something is watching me while I sleep.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.891
What's wrong? Are you not sleeping enough?
Not taking your pills?

37:07.893 --> 37:10.360
- Not the pills, Michael. I'm serious.
- Like how?

37:10.762 --> 37:12.529
I don't want to talk about it.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.964
All right, fine.

37:15.901 --> 37:19.236
I wake up in the middle
of the night alone,

37:20.372 --> 37:24.741
but I truly believe
that something is here

37:25.477 --> 37:29.646
watching me, staring at me.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.582
I can feel it breathing
down my neck sometimes.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.285
- Really? Are you serious?
- I don't know.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.821
I can't explain it, but
there is a presence.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.324
It's-- I swear to
God, I'm not crazy.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.826
Something or someone is watching me sleep,
it feels like every night.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.494
Well, sometimes
I see things too.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.897
- I'm really tired.
- Yeah, but there's seeing

37:46.898 --> 37:49.299
and then there's feeling, Michael,
I physically feel this presence.

37:49.935 --> 37:50.867
Kiddo.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.403
Have fun.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.506
I'll have her back tomorrow.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.841
Got a couple of meetings
in the morning.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.709
She promised to suck
it up and wait on.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.513
- Thanks for this.
- Yeah.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.449
Good night.

38:07.019 --> 38:07.917
Michael.

38:08.987 --> 38:09.953
Yeah.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.624
Nothing. It's just--
Uh, we'll talk later.

38:15.694 --> 38:16.660
All right.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.431
I don't know.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.933
She's just so hard to
communicate with.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.636
And now she's talking
to herself in her sleep.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.905
How do I even deal with that?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.640
<i>Have you</i>
<i>considered counseling?</i>

38:30.642 --> 38:33.410
- For me or for her?
- Maybe all three of y'all.

38:34.513 --> 38:35.979
God, we'd never--

38:36.782 --> 38:38.815
And Cassie won't even
look me in the eyes anymore.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.750
I feel like a goddamn prisoner
in my own house.

38:40.752 --> 38:44.387
<i>Listen, baby, this</i>
<i>happens all the time.</i>

38:44.856 --> 38:47.657
<i>You guys are close.</i>
<i>You have an important bond.</i>

38:48.360 --> 38:49.526
<i>You'll pull through it.</i>

38:49.528 --> 38:50.960
I was so young when I had her.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.563
I feel like she just doesn't
respect me as a mom.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.933
I feel like her older sister
sometimes, you know.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.735
I--

39:00.372 --> 39:02.339
- I think I might be pregnant.
<i>- What?</i>

39:03.742 --> 39:04.641
<i>How?</i>

39:05.377 --> 39:08.145
I don't know.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.914
I-- I-- I feel like Michael and I haven't
even slept in the same bed in months.

39:10.916 --> 39:16.853
<i>Girl, don't you know,</i>
<i>those little guys can swim for weeks up inside of you</i>

39:16.855 --> 39:19.889
<i>unless you're out there giving</i>
<i>up that booty to someone else.</i>

39:19.891 --> 39:21.091
Oh, please.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.761
Oh.

39:24.762 --> 39:27.563
<i>Look, you just need to get some rest so we can focus on the writing.</i>

39:27.566 --> 39:29.566
<i>Blogs have paid the</i>
<i>bills for just a little bit,</i>

39:29.568 --> 39:33.570
<i>but an online autobiography</i>
<i>that followers can relate to.</i>

39:34.072 --> 39:35.772
<i>Now that's the real money.</i>

39:35.774 --> 39:37.107
<i>You know about that paper?</i>

39:37.976 --> 39:40.710
Look, girl, it'll turn around.

39:41.113 --> 39:42.479
I'm here for you.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.447
<i>But you should keep yourself.</i>

39:44.449 --> 39:46.483
- What?
- <i>What do you mean what?</i>

39:46.485 --> 39:49.786
<i>I'm just saying that maybe you</i>
<i>need a little time for yourself.</i>

39:50.422 --> 39:51.888
Okay. Um...

39:53.658 --> 39:55.458
I should probably get going.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.426
<i>Love you, boo.</i>

39:57.662 --> 39:58.928
Love you too.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.070
Come on.

42:53.972 --> 42:55.071
<i>Look up.</i>

43:56.968 --> 43:58.401
Is anyone here?

45:00.732 --> 45:01.898
You had a good time?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.101
Yeah.

45:08.173 --> 45:09.372
So what did you guys do?

45:10.909 --> 45:13.843
Watched some films, sat
through some boring movies.

45:13.845 --> 45:16.713
Hm. Did you sit
through some meetings?

45:19.084 --> 45:20.249
I like your hair.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.852
It's very pretty.

45:22.854 --> 45:23.953
Thanks.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.022
Dad's friend
came over last night.

45:26.024 --> 45:26.856
She did it.

45:33.498 --> 45:34.330
Hm.

45:34.332 --> 45:35.748
Yeah, she's cool.

45:35.749 --> 45:37.165
You two would get along.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.873
I'm going to go and
listen to some music.

47:09.594 --> 47:12.829
No! No! No! No!

47:12.831 --> 47:15.164
No! No! No! No!

47:15.166 --> 47:17.500
- Don't touch me!
- Mom.

47:18.937 --> 47:20.303
- Mom.
- Oh, my God.

47:21.105 --> 47:22.271
You okay?

47:22.273 --> 47:23.573
It's okay.

47:24.609 --> 47:25.842
I'm sorry.

47:29.581 --> 47:30.513
I'm okay.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.446
I'm okay. It was
just a bad dream.

47:31.449 --> 47:33.149
You sure?

47:36.287 --> 47:37.353
Go to bed.

47:37.355 --> 47:40.223
I don't think I can go
to bed after that.

47:44.929 --> 47:47.396
- Wanna lie with me?
- Yeah.

47:47.398 --> 47:48.564
Okay.

47:57.242 --> 47:58.258
Mom,

47:58.259 --> 47:59.275
why can't you ever
sleep at night?

48:01.880 --> 48:03.079
I don't know.

48:03.514 --> 48:05.214
Is it because of him?

48:06.284 --> 48:07.516
Your dad?

48:07.518 --> 48:08.618
No.

48:08.620 --> 48:09.485
No.

48:09.487 --> 48:15.024
I know I'm only nine, but I'm
much smarter than I look.

48:17.128 --> 48:18.194
Yes.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.029
Yes, you are.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.398
Do you think he's in heaven?

48:23.601 --> 48:24.567
Of course.

48:25.970 --> 48:27.203
Of course he is.

48:28.306 --> 48:29.372
I miss him.

48:33.044 --> 48:34.243
I miss him too.

48:55.934 --> 48:58.935
For real, breakfast? What have
you done with my mother?

48:58.937 --> 49:00.703
Oh, you're so funny.

49:00.705 --> 49:03.973
What do you think I was going to do with all these groceries?
Go sit.

49:08.413 --> 49:09.979
- You want toast?
- No, thanks.

49:09.981 --> 49:10.579
Okay.

49:10.581 --> 49:14.083
I finally got a few hours
of sleep last night.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.084
Me too.

49:15.086 --> 49:20.122
- So you're ready for school?
- Ugh! Don't remind me.

49:20.124 --> 49:21.724
Not for three more weeks.

49:21.726 --> 49:23.860
You know you're lucky.

49:23.861 --> 49:25.995
When I was your age,
my mom forced me to go to summer school.

49:26.431 --> 49:28.464
I thought you were
a straight A student.

49:28.466 --> 49:29.465
Hey, man.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.267
Your mom was cool.

49:31.602 --> 49:32.401
Anyway.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.671
I was a nice student
pretty much but

49:36.607 --> 49:39.342
my mom always said to
never stop learning, so

49:40.144 --> 49:43.179
even till now I try to learn
something new every day.

49:43.181 --> 49:44.447
What did you learn today?

49:48.519 --> 49:50.119
How to get you to smile again.

49:58.696 --> 50:00.029
Hey.

50:00.031 --> 50:01.764
Girl, is everything okay?

50:01.765 --> 50:03.498
Oh, yeah, sorry I had
to get back last night.

50:03.501 --> 50:06.102
No, not that. The video
that you sent me.

50:06.771 --> 50:08.371
What are you talking about?

50:08.373 --> 50:10.106
The video you posted.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.375
Like, there's-- there's like
twelve videos on your page.

50:12.377 --> 50:14.310
People are commenting,
bucking the fuck out.

50:14.312 --> 50:15.745
Okay. Sorry. Hold on a second.

50:18.649 --> 50:19.715
<i>Look at it.</i>

50:19.717 --> 50:22.785
<i>Wait, wait, first of all,</i>
<i>how do you not know what I'm talking about?</i>

50:22.787 --> 50:24.687
<i>That's what's confusing to me.</i>

50:33.765 --> 50:35.731
Sera, I'm going to have
to call you back.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.668
What the hell is wrong with you?

50:38.669 --> 50:40.603
- You're crazy.
- You haven't even seen crazy yet.

50:40.605 --> 50:42.505
- I didn't do anything.
- Go to your room!

50:42.507 --> 50:44.206
I hate you!

50:48.312 --> 50:49.678
Jesus Christ!

52:17.602 --> 52:19.435
That's enough! I've had it!

52:21.539 --> 52:24.340
- Give me back my phone!
- Your work is bullshit.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.407
Wait!

52:28.546 --> 52:31.413
Enough is enough.
No more phone. No more iPad.

52:31.415 --> 52:32.848
No more e-mail. You are through.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.350
This is why dad hates you.

52:34.352 --> 52:36.919
I hate you. I wish
you died and not him.

52:38.222 --> 52:39.722
Go to your room!

55:10.308 --> 55:11.340
Mom?

55:14.445 --> 55:15.844
<i>Wake up, Danni.</i>

55:20.584 --> 55:21.984
Wake up!

55:21.986 --> 55:24.486
Cassie! Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

55:24.488 --> 55:26.488
What? Mom, what
are you talking about?

55:26.490 --> 55:27.856
- Did the man hurt you?
- What man?

55:27.858 --> 55:29.591
Listen, there's somebody
in our home, okay?

55:29.593 --> 55:31.071
No, the alarm didn't went off.

55:31.072 --> 55:32.550
Okay. Listen to me, I need
you to go into your room.

55:32.551 --> 55:34.029
I need you to go into your
room and I need you to lock it.

55:34.031 --> 55:35.597
- Mom!
- Right now!

55:36.067 --> 55:37.333
Lock it!

57:45.029 --> 57:45.994
Cassie?

57:53.838 --> 57:54.770
No!

58:00.211 --> 58:01.577
Cassie!

58:17.695 --> 58:18.827
Cassie!

58:20.664 --> 58:21.530
Hello?

58:21.532 --> 58:22.764
<i>ATI Security.</i>

58:22.766 --> 58:24.544
Hello.

58:24.545 --> 58:26.323
<i>Yes, ma'am,</i>
<i>do you have your associated PIN number on hand by any chance?</i>

58:26.324 --> 58:28.102
I can't remember.
My fucking child was just taken!

58:28.105 --> 58:30.038
<i>Easy. It's an emergency.</i>
<i>Can you describe her?</i>

58:30.040 --> 58:32.875
- My daughter?
- <i>Yeah. What does she look like?</i>

58:33.611 --> 58:37.079
She's 9. She's-- uh...

58:37.748 --> 58:39.982
I don't know. She's beautiful.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.684
<i>How long ago was she taken?</i>

58:42.686 --> 58:45.120
This has just happened! I need
you to send someone right now!

58:45.122 --> 58:47.122
<i>Okay, ma'am, I'm going</i>
<i>to need you to calm down.</i>

58:47.124 --> 58:50.626
Calm down? I can't fucking calm down.
My child was just taken!

58:50.628 --> 58:52.194
- Mommy!
- Cassie!

58:53.030 --> 58:54.062
Mom!

58:57.001 --> 58:57.933
I'm coming!

59:00.571 --> 59:01.937
<i>Ma'am, are you still there?</i>

59:04.708 --> 59:06.008
Mom!

59:06.677 --> 59:07.543
Cassie!

59:09.780 --> 59:12.948
<i>Ma'am, before I can send help,</i>
<i>I need you to answer a few more questions.</i>

59:12.950 --> 59:15.250
Fuck off with your stupid
fucking questions!

59:15.252 --> 59:16.785
You fucking idiot!

59:16.787 --> 59:18.287
Ma'am...

59:18.289 --> 59:19.555
Hello.

59:19.890 --> 59:20.856
Hello?

59:22.693 --> 59:24.059
Oh, fuck.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.994
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

59:25.996 --> 59:27.129
Oh, shit.

59:27.798 --> 59:28.630
Fuck!

59:28.632 --> 59:30.566
- Mom!
- Cassie!

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:09.871
This is getting sloppy.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:15.377
If you're not professional,
you're going to get caught. You hear me?

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.713
Now what do you want
me to do with her?

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.248
I want my fucking money!

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.018
Otherwise you're not going to see either one of them again.
You hear me?

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:26.388
Fuck.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.156
Fuck! I'll call you back.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:37.899
Oh, oh!

01:00:58.288 --> 01:00:59.354
Cassie!

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.027
Oh, Cassie.

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.997
Cassie. Cassie, it's me.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.966
It's me. Cassie, please be okay. You're okay.
You're okay, right? You're okay?

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:13.435
Cassie? Cassie.

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:16.838
Cassie, are you okay?
Baby, I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.774
- Tell me what to do.
- Mom.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.278
- Cassie, are you okay?
- I don't remember.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.814
Where did he go?
Where did he go? Cassie.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:28.784
I ran as fast as I could.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.353
I hit a branch, I fell.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.988
Let me see your head.

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:35.891
Oh, God.

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:38.860
Shh! Just be quiet.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:40.295
Shh!

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:45.967
Okay.

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:50.772
Okay. Okay.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:53.775
- What are you doing?
- Shhh! Just trust me.

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:57.212
Just trust me, okay?

01:01:57.848 --> 01:02:01.083
Just trust me, okay? Just--

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.187
Okay, you too. Come on, faster.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:08.457
Okay. Okay.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:11.026
Okay. Okay, just
close your eyes.

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:07.349
Okay. Okay.

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:10.786
Okay.

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:14.556
I got to get the car keys and then we got to get out of here, okay?

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:17.526
- I don't know how long until help comes.
- Mom, you can't even walk.

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:19.461
Just help me get
through the front door.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.429
Okay.

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:25.333
- Mom, what if he comes back?
- He went the other way. I saw him.

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.136
Mom, I want dad.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.037
Okay.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:33.241
We're going to get the hell out of here, okay?
Call your dad again.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.510
<i>Hey, this is Michael.</i>
<i>Sorry, I missed you.</i>

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.013
<i>Just leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.217
Hey, dad. It's me.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:44.152
Someone broke into the house.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.388
Oh. No!

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:01.002
¶¶¶

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.660
<i>Wake up, Danni.</i>
- Danni!

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.029
Danni.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.434
What happened? Hey.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:09.304
Look, I don't know
where Cassie is.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:12.941
Oh. Ah! I think it's broken.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.510
Fuck. Fuck. Okay.
We got to call for help.

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:18.380
- We had-- I called. No one came.
- Hey, I'm here.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:19.447
I'm here.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.182
You got to go find her.

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.094
You know I love
you just so much.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.965
- You're so beautiful.
- What the fuck is wrong with you? Go, go.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:38.233
Get her! Go!

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:41.136
It's all going to be okay.

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:46.107
What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
What is happening? Just go, go get her.

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.143
What are you talk-- Where is he?

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.044
She's safe.

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:54.683
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:56.217
I'm so so sorry.

01:05:58.088 --> 01:05:59.254
Hey.

01:05:59.256 --> 01:06:04.960
I'm sorry, Danni,
but you-- you've already taken one of my children.

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:06.261
I can't allow you
to do that again.

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:10.031
What the hell is going
on? Just let me go.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.068
I can't do that.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.973
You see, I love my children.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:25.246
All I've wanted was my baby
boy. You destroyed that.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.450
And then you destroyed us.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.388
Now you're trying to take away
the one thing that I have left.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.323
I would never do that.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.726
But you did.

01:06:37.728 --> 01:06:39.461
But you did!

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:41.997
You did! You fucking
killed him! You know it!

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:49.337
Danni, wake up!
Wake up! Danni, wake up!

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:09.057
You fucking killed him.
Just fucking say it.

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:10.292
Just say it.

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:11.526
- Just fucking say it.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.129
Just let me go.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:19.734
So this is how it's
going to go, babe.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.076
You're sleeping

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:34.582
and it's funny he's been
watching you every night,

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:38.353
learning everything
there is to know about you.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.288
Breaks in.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.257
He ties you up.

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:46.361
You wrestle
with him a little bit.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.430
You're so strong.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.466
You tried to escape
through the woods.

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:55.303
But he caught you and
he brought you back here.

01:07:58.442 --> 01:07:59.741
He roughed you up.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.543
Michael, I saw what you did.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.545
You don't have to.

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:08.450
- It's the only way.
- You don't want to do this.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.186
You don't want to do this.

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:18.827
He tossed the drawers, looking
for jewelry. He found nothing!

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.863
And he decided it was time.

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:27.102
- You don't want to do--
- It's time to put a bullet in your head.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:28.502
You don't want to do this.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:30.104
You don't want to do this.

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:34.408
Cassie and I, we'll live
together forever,

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.745
happy and safe.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.447
Michael, I'm pregnant.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.648
It's yours.

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:44.219
- You're lying to me!
- I swear to God, I'm not lying.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.587
- Just let me go and I will show you.
- No.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:46.888
I will show you.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.356
Okay? I swear to God.

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:51.192
Stop. Don't do that. Lies!

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:56.515
You're lying!

01:08:56.515 --> 01:08:57.698
I swear to God. I swear to God.
I'm not lying to you.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.167
Just please let me go.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.806
Where is she?

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:45.940
Where is he?

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:48.476
Christ.

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:50.712
Where is my little girl?

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.548
She's sleeping
safely in the back.

01:11:04.027 --> 01:11:05.426
She's not here.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:08.296
She was fucking just
there. I swear to God.

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:10.031
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:13.034
She was just fucking there.
I swear to God.

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.035
She's my child.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.903
She was in the fucking back.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:17.639
She was there.

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.044
<i>Look, Danni.</i>

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:11.959
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:15.330
Cassie!

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.439
No.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:13.721
Don't look.

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.423
Don't look.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.131
Don't look.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.741
Mom, I forgive you.

01:13:50.794 --> 01:13:52.126
¶¶¶

01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:37.905
Morning, babe.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.207
<i>Look.</i>

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:40.708
<i>Can you see me?</i>
