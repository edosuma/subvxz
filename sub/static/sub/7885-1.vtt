WEBVTT

01:45.356 --> 01:46.899
Outta the way!

02:08.838 --> 02:10.339
Here they come.

02:10.506 --> 02:13.384
Philippe, 100 euros
says I can lose them.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.345
- Philippe.
- You're on.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.013
Here we go.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.289
You're in shape. God!

02:54.258 --> 02:55.384
Shit!

02:56.927 --> 02:58.012
Fuck!

02:58.179 --> 02:59.180
So you lost them?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.891
Get out! Hands on the hood!

03:03.184 --> 03:05.603
- Get out!
- Two hundred says I get an escort.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.396
You'll lose again.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.106
- Two hundred, an escort!
- You're on.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.816
Let's see your hands!

03:10.983 --> 03:12.526
Your goddamn hands!

03:13.527 --> 03:14.653
Let me explain.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.865
Shut your mouth
and put your hands on the hood!

03:18.032 --> 03:19.033
Hold on.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.370
- Let go!
- I said get out!

03:23.537 --> 03:25.039
He can't get out!

03:25.206 --> 03:26.665
He can't even open the door!

03:27.208 --> 03:28.918
- What?
- Look at the sticker!

03:29.084 --> 03:31.545
There's a wheelchair in the trunk!

03:31.712 --> 03:33.088
Go and check!

03:33.255 --> 03:34.673
Take a look.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.300
Let go of me.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.803
Yeah.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.513
Well?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.057
What is this?

03:43.224 --> 03:46.185
You think I drive that fast
for the hell of it?

03:46.477 --> 03:48.187
We're heading for the hospital.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.314
He's having a fit, OK.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.774
It's an emergency!

03:51.941 --> 03:53.943
He can't move! I'm his caregiver.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.653
We have a problem.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.529
Look.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.534
What do we do?

04:02.701 --> 04:05.120
Know what? Think it over.
Take your time.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.666
Then call his kid and say
you killed her dad!

04:08.832 --> 04:11.126
In five minutes, he'll be a goner,

04:11.293 --> 04:12.836
dead as a dodo.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.213
So take your time.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.260
Go on, think it over!
While he croaks.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.595
OK, get going.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.028
- Where are you heading?
- The ER.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.155
We'll escort you, it's safer.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.658
We're escorting them. Let's go!

04:45.035 --> 04:47.955
It's OK, they're splitting.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.292
This is really gross, Philippe.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.712
Freaks me out.
How do you produce this stuff?

04:54.878 --> 04:58.132
Maybe you should take
that driving test now.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.552
Yes, but for now,
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

05:01.719 --> 05:03.178
An escort at 200 euros.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.639
I never wager such large sums.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.225
This calls for a change of mood.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.061
"We'll escort you, it's safer."

05:11.228 --> 05:14.356
Come on, I helped you out.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.276
Philippe, the escort.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.862
The escort, it's safer.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.199
We'll escort you, it's safer!

06:58.335 --> 06:59.378
Here he comes.

07:00.963 --> 07:04.091
They're bringing a stretcher.
You'll be OK?

07:04.258 --> 07:05.884
- Yes, fine.
- Good luck.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.052
Goodbye.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.611
What do we do now?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.197
You let me handle it now.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.474
Any references?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.683
Yes, I have a DAHC,

08:38.059 --> 08:40.812
a Diploma in Advanced Home Care.

08:40.979 --> 08:46.068
I backed it up with training
at the Bayer Institute in 2001.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.195
I studied social work at school,

08:48.362 --> 08:51.782
then did a course
in social and family economics.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.409
Actually, the thing is...

08:54.576 --> 08:56.995
I've done more studying
than working.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.706
What is your key motivation?

09:00.499 --> 09:01.708
Money.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.835
The man.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.088
I'm totally into that.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.839
That's nice.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.050
Helping others, I think.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.427
Is that OK? Did I get it right?

09:13.428 --> 09:14.346
The neighborhood.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.390
I like crippled people,

09:16.557 --> 09:18.058
since I was little.

09:18.267 --> 09:21.895
Working to make the handicapped
independent,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.230
on a social level.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.899
Sport too. You need to move.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.694
To fit in with life.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.238
These people can't do a thing.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.032
I had
my first professional experience...

09:34.283 --> 09:36.285
That was Mrs. Dupont-Moretti...

09:36.451 --> 09:38.662
A very old lady...

09:40.747 --> 09:41.748
...really very old...

09:41.915 --> 09:46.378
...whom I cared for until the end.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.423
There were fun times
in the geriatric unit

09:49.590 --> 09:51.049
at Halloween and so on.

09:51.216 --> 09:55.387
I'm also an expert
with bureaucracy.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.348
Housing grants, for instance.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.100
I don't know. Maybe...

10:01.476 --> 10:02.603
...you get one?

10:03.020 --> 10:05.772
Check, Magalie,
but somehow I doubt it.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.741
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

10:15.907 --> 10:16.908
Enough.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.661
- I'm Laprade.
- I'm sick of waiting.

10:25.917 --> 10:26.918
Hello.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.420
I need a signature.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.548
Have a seat.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.597
Any references?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.725
- I have plenty.
- All right.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.560
We're listening.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.521
Kool and the Gang,
Earth, Wind & Fire.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.231
Good references?

10:49.900 --> 10:51.526
I don't know them. Sit down.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.279
You know nothing about music.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.366
I'm no ignoramus
when it comes to music

10:57.532 --> 10:59.576
even if I don't know Cruel...

10:59.743 --> 11:01.745
- Kool and the Gang.
- And you?

11:01.912 --> 11:04.498
Do you know Chopin,
Schubert or Berlioz?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.750
Do I know Berlioz?

11:07.584 --> 11:08.919
I bet you don't!

11:09.670 --> 11:11.213
I'm a specialist.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.381
Oh yeah?

11:13.423 --> 11:14.800
Who do you know there?

11:16.468 --> 11:17.469
Which building?

11:17.928 --> 11:19.471
What do you mean?

11:19.638 --> 11:22.265
Before becoming a housing project,

11:22.432 --> 11:26.228
Berlioz was a 19th century composer,
writer and critic.

11:26.395 --> 11:30.482
Bullshit. I know who Berlioz is.
Humor's like music for you.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.777
You suck at both.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.615
You need a signature?

11:42.411 --> 11:45.706
Yeah, to say
I applied for the job...

11:46.581 --> 11:49.000
...but that despite
my obvious qualities...

11:49.167 --> 11:52.587
Just put the usual spiel
about not being interested.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.424
I need three refusals
to get the benefit.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.676
I see, your benefit.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.386
Any other motivations?

11:59.553 --> 12:00.554
Yes, plenty.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.640
One right here.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.684
Very motivating in fact.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.731
OK, I'm having a blast,
but what do we do?

12:10.897 --> 12:11.982
Sign or not?

12:12.816 --> 12:14.443
I can't sign right now.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.778
- Why not?
- Why not?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.875
That's a bummer.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.878
I'm already late handing it in.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.630
That's a bummer as you say.

12:37.299 --> 12:41.219
- Can't Ms. Motivation sign for you?
- Magalie isn't authorized.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.434
Too bad, she could have added
her cell number.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.312
Pick it up tomorrow at nine.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.939
I'd hate to deprive you
of your benefit.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.483
I won't see you out.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.276
No, don't get up.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.904
I mean, stay seated.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.281
I'll come back tomorrow.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.869
Mina, is she here?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.538
No, she'll be back late.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.629
No!

13:58.588 --> 14:01.466
Turn the tap off
or I don't have any water!

14:01.675 --> 14:02.801
Turn the tap off!

14:03.218 --> 14:04.594
Get out of here!

14:04.761 --> 14:06.096
I'm taking a shower!

14:06.263 --> 14:07.889
- Leave me be!
- Out!

14:08.139 --> 14:09.850
Get them out.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.017
Go on.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.019
Bintou, I'm serious!

14:13.186 --> 14:14.187
Mina!

14:15.063 --> 14:16.064
Get them out!

14:16.231 --> 14:17.941
Get out with your big belly.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.442
Let go!

14:20.110 --> 14:21.027
Get out!

14:21.194 --> 14:22.362
Out, you lot!

14:22.529 --> 14:23.822
Get it?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.949
- Hey, Bintou.
- Let go!

14:26.116 --> 14:27.784
Bintou, what the hell?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.619
Sit down, you!

14:48.722 --> 14:51.057
- Where were you?
- At school.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.938
Where are you going?

14:57.105 --> 14:58.523
Horse-riding.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.691
Wise guy.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.731
Here, it's for you.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.818
Where were you?

15:45.737 --> 15:46.947
On vacation.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.116
People talk around here.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.202
You think I'm a dumb bitch?

15:52.410 --> 15:54.245
Six months without seeing you.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.289
Not one phone call.
Nothing!

15:56.456 --> 15:59.084
And now you turn up
with a Kinder egg?

15:59.834 --> 16:02.587
You think your scams
will pay for the rent,

16:02.754 --> 16:03.838
for food?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.844
You think this is a hotel?

16:11.054 --> 16:13.139
Look at me when I talk to you!

16:15.392 --> 16:16.726
Idiot!

16:17.811 --> 16:19.688
There's no talking to you!

16:19.980 --> 16:20.981
Want to talk?

16:25.276 --> 16:26.361
I'm listening.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.910
I'm listening.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.790
You know, Driss,

16:38.957 --> 16:41.292
I've done a lot of praying for you.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.295
But, God forgive me,

16:44.462 --> 16:45.672
I have other children.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.426
I still have hope for them.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.347
I don't want you coming back here.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.144
Just pack up your bags
and get the hell out.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.520
Is that clear?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.565
Get out.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.483
Get out!

18:24.687 --> 18:26.106
That was a good one, right?

18:28.149 --> 18:29.484
Know what? I'm going.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.361
- It wasn't funny?
- Forget it.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.071
It wasn't funny?

19:28.459 --> 19:30.920
<i>- Yes?</i>
- It's for my paper.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.047
<i>- I was expecting you.</i>
- About...

19:34.090 --> 19:35.800
<i>- Come in.</i>
...my benefit.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.062
Tell Philippe he's here.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.607
Right away.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.071
Well?

19:57.238 --> 19:59.782
No beetroot,
but the radishes are nearly ready.

19:59.949 --> 20:00.909
Good.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.076
Hello.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.627
Come along.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.089
I'm warning you, he had a bad night.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.592
Like you apparently.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.971
His day begins at 7:00 a.m.
With the nurse.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.058
He needs two to three hours of care
each morning.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.853
Many applicants throw in the towel
after a week.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.438
We see a lot of them.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.735
I like the decor,
the music and all the rest,

20:35.902 --> 20:38.821
but I'm not buying
and I have stuff to do.

20:38.988 --> 20:42.492
I was told to show you around.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.118
Anyhow, it's nearly over.

20:44.369 --> 20:47.538
To communicate,
you have a baby monitor.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.666
It's like a walkie-talkie.

20:50.041 --> 20:54.128
Under the terms of the contract,
you have your own quarters.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.880
This is the toilet.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.552
And you have a separate bathroom.

21:06.933 --> 21:07.934
This way.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.867
He's expecting you.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.160
Just a minute.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.757
I had your paper signed.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.176
It's on the table over there.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.185
So you like being assisted?

21:52.145 --> 21:53.062
What?

21:53.229 --> 21:55.481
You don't mind
living off others' backs?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.650
It's not a problem for you?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.278
No. How about you?

22:02.947 --> 22:07.744
Do you think you're capable of working?
With constraints, regular hours,

22:07.910 --> 22:09.078
responsibilities...

22:09.245 --> 22:10.913
A sense of humor after all.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.751
And I'm ready to try you out
for a month.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.211
You have a day to think it over.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.215
I bet you won't last two weeks.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.829
What?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.247
<i>No bone,</i>

22:53.414 --> 22:56.292
no muscle should be ignored.
Move them all.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.545
Keep the skin and joints
in good condition.

22:59.712 --> 23:03.966
To do that,
you need to be meticulous,

23:04.133 --> 23:07.387
and strict.
All right? Is that clear?

23:07.553 --> 23:09.263
Wake up!

23:09.430 --> 23:10.890
You sleep at night!

23:11.057 --> 23:12.141
I'm not asleep.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.351
Help me.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.437
Let's put Philippe in his chair...

23:17.397 --> 23:19.315
...and get him to the shower.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.276
I know...

23:23.277 --> 23:24.904
Try it on your own. Show me.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.163
Don't be scared. Go on.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.748
I'm not scared.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.303
Happy now?

23:50.638 --> 23:53.433
Never let him go
until he's strapped in.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.310
Yes, I'm kinky that way.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.312
No one told me.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.233
I'm in training.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.196
Do you want white gloves or what?
Scrub away!

24:07.363 --> 24:10.241
The shampoo's weird,
it won't lather.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.035
- How's it going?
- It won't lather.

24:13.703 --> 24:14.871
What?

24:15.163 --> 24:17.331
I don't believe it.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.709
That's his foot cream.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.335
Hold on.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.589
Don't tell me you can't read, Driss!

24:24.755 --> 24:25.923
Sure I can, but...

24:26.424 --> 24:28.134
You seem pretty gifted.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.220
Usually it's one for the whole body.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.555
This guy has 20.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.600
I'm not spending all day here.

24:35.766 --> 24:36.893
This one then?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.728
The one marked shampoo.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.231
Will you manage?

24:42.398 --> 24:43.983
Of course he will.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.777
My feet are beautifully coiffed.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.363
Go and have lunch, Marcelle.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.367
Where's the skirt?

24:53.618 --> 24:57.997
They're support stockings.
They help the blood to flow properly

24:58.164 --> 24:59.373
so I don't faint.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.670
I'm not doing that.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.215
There's a problem here.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.717
Seeing as how I won't be doing it,

25:09.884 --> 25:13.262
we need to see if...
Marcelle!

25:13.429 --> 25:17.141
Maybe Marcelle could come back
to put them on you.

25:17.308 --> 25:21.270
She knows how to do it,
being a chick and all that...

25:21.437 --> 25:23.773
I'm just not doing it, OK.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.650
You're better off fainting.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.401
I mean, sometimes...

25:28.402 --> 25:30.404
We just refuse to put them on.
We're men.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.781
No way, Marcelle!

25:42.458 --> 25:44.293
You're good with stockings.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.296
Only natural with that cute earring.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.757
Can we cut the joking?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.302
You're a natural at this.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.721
Haven't you ever considered work...

25:57.014 --> 25:58.599
...as a beautician?

26:02.812 --> 26:04.313
OK, that's done.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.940
What are the gloves for?

26:06.482 --> 26:10.444
Let's wait a while.
You're not quite ready for that yet.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.947
No, he's not quite ready.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.908
What do you mean,
not ready for what?

26:16.409 --> 26:18.327
- What is this?
- We'll explain.

26:18.494 --> 26:22.415
We need to talk, Marcelle!
This training's not working.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.333
Ready or not,

26:24.625 --> 26:27.461
I'm not emptying the ass
of a guy I don't know.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.089
Or even of a guy I do know.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.050
I don't empty anyone's ass,
on principle.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.512
Can I finish eating first?

26:42.476 --> 26:43.477
No.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.980
Let's just leave it at this.

26:46.147 --> 26:48.608
I don't go for this sick stuff.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.736
The stockings were bad enough.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.779
But I met you part way.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.325
Your turn.
Drop the ass emptying.

26:57.491 --> 26:58.868
- I get the message.
- It's wrong.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.369
Just drop it.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.704
Enjoy your lunch.

27:09.003 --> 27:09.962
Beautiful, huh?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.339
I love it.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.387
Don't mind me.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.099
You're not at the movies,
I'm eating here.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.603
Hi. Where can I find a beer?

27:26.145 --> 27:27.480
Maybe in your wig.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.816
You took both packs?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.276
No idea. I don't care.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.070
Take your mop-head for a walk.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.738
Let's go.

27:35.905 --> 27:38.282
He's the guy my dad hired.

27:38.449 --> 27:39.784
Oh, right.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.535
The guy has a name.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.606
- What?
- Sorry.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.400
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.151
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.529
Just massaging away.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.376
Fucking weird.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.296
Have you finished playing?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.091
You can't feel a thing?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.802
Have you gone mad?!

28:39.969 --> 28:41.470
He's experimenting.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.097
He can't feel a thing.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.640
You'll burn him!

28:54.775 --> 28:55.901
Lawyer.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.778
Lawyer.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.492
That's personal.
I'll read it later.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.910
The "personal" file?

29:11.751 --> 29:12.752
Trash.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.629
She's not bad.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.674
How about a "hooker" file?

29:25.639 --> 29:26.640
Enjoy your meal.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.309
Thank you.

29:33.606 --> 29:34.607
Do you mind?

29:39.028 --> 29:40.112
Sorry.

29:51.624 --> 29:52.875
Shit, I keep forgetting.

29:55.503 --> 29:56.712
Shit, sorry.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.930
That feels good.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.934
<i>Driss, come here, please.</i>

30:11.393 --> 30:12.686
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

30:14.522 --> 30:16.065
<i>Come here, please.</i>

30:27.409 --> 30:28.410
What?

30:29.495 --> 30:32.039
It's nearly nine. Philippe's waiting.

30:32.206 --> 30:35.167
Nine already? This bath gel
takes ages to foam.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.335
What a pigsty.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.546
Can you make my coffee?

30:38.712 --> 30:39.713
The baby monitor!

30:40.089 --> 30:41.423
Always with you!

30:41.632 --> 30:43.592
And Nutella!

30:43.759 --> 30:46.387
Not that jam made with weird fruit!

31:05.781 --> 31:07.324
I'm not getting in this.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.745
And I'm not loading you
into the back like a horse.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.000
What's this?

31:16.792 --> 31:19.086
That one's less suitable.

31:21.630 --> 31:22.548
Meaning?

31:22.715 --> 31:25.759
Unfortunately,
we need to be pragmatic.

31:27.761 --> 31:28.762
Pragmatic?

31:32.683 --> 31:33.893
Holy fuck.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.478
Listen to that.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.355
- It feels so good.
- It's great.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.773
This is good.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.318
She's nervy.

31:42.985 --> 31:44.028
Let's go!

31:54.705 --> 31:56.624
The neighbor keeps parking there.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.751
He thinks it's his space.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.714
Not for much longer.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.302
How's it going?

32:08.469 --> 32:11.805
Am I bothering you, Blondie?
Want a coffee?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.143
Come on.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.396
- Go on, read this!
- "Keep free at all times."

32:19.563 --> 32:20.564
Louder!

32:21.565 --> 32:22.524
That's the way.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.485
- Read it all.
- "Reserved parking."

32:24.693 --> 32:26.820
Get that into your thick skull
and move!

32:27.279 --> 32:29.907
Go on, Blondie, piss off!

32:40.292 --> 32:42.836
We open Tuesday.
It'll be sold by then.

32:43.212 --> 32:44.129
Can we go?

32:44.296 --> 32:47.675
You've been there an hour.
Time to switch channels.

32:48.509 --> 32:52.638
There's a lot of serenity in it.
A certain violence too.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.014
It's very touching.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.850
Touching? Red splashes on white?

32:57.518 --> 32:58.602
How much is it?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.855
Thirty thousand euros, I think,
but I'll check.

33:02.564 --> 33:03.565
Yeah, check.

33:03.899 --> 33:06.151
That price seems way high to me.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.324
You can't buy this crap!
It's not possible!

33:12.825 --> 33:13.867
It is possible.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.745
The guy wants 30 grand
for a nosebleed!

33:16.912 --> 33:18.747
Tell me, Driss,

33:18.914 --> 33:20.874
why are people interested in art?

33:22.292 --> 33:24.670
- It's all business, I guess.
- No.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.382
It's the trace
of our passage on this earth.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.175
Bullshit.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.220
For 50 euros,
I'll do you a trace of my passage.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.847
I'll even add some blue!

33:35.014 --> 33:37.599
Enough. Give me a chocolate.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.060
No.

33:41.645 --> 33:42.646
Give me a chocolate.

33:44.314 --> 33:45.649
No handy, no candy.

33:49.319 --> 33:50.487
It's a joke.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.364
I'm kidding.

33:53.574 --> 33:54.950
- It's a joke?
- Yes.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.244
- A joke.
- It's a good one.

33:57.411 --> 33:59.329
A very good joke.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.915
That's the punch line, see.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.834
But in your case...

34:04.001 --> 34:05.127
Come on.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.921
- It's wicked.
- It's a good joke.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.007
You got no hands, Philippe.

34:12.509 --> 34:15.012
I'll tell it to Marge Simpson.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.518
I was wrong about the price.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.855
It's 41,500 euros.

34:25.938 --> 34:26.940
I'll take it.

34:27.858 --> 34:28.859
You will?

34:38.994 --> 34:40.245
Hi, Philippe.

34:40.954 --> 34:41.955
How are you doing?

34:42.706 --> 34:45.167
You summoned me, so here I am.

34:45.375 --> 34:46.543
I'm listening.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.505
What's so urgent?

34:50.005 --> 34:51.965
I didn't summon you.

34:56.136 --> 34:59.098
You must have some idea
why I'm here.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.060
Who is this fellow?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.354
Everyone's worried.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.857
Yvonne tells me
he's reckless, violent...

35:09.024 --> 35:10.275
He hit a neighbor?

35:11.276 --> 35:14.947
I don't need to tell you
you have to be vigilant.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.950
Don't let just anyone
into your home,

35:18.117 --> 35:19.785
especially not in your state.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.999
I'm not really sure
you know whom you're dealing with.

35:28.085 --> 35:29.378
Carry on.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.298
I called Sivot
at the Justice Ministry.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.467
The boy isn't Al Capone,

35:35.634 --> 35:37.761
but young Driss has a record.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.014
He just did six months for robbery.

35:43.809 --> 35:44.977
On top of the rest...

35:46.186 --> 35:47.896
...I'm told he's useless.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.231
Be careful.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.608
These street guys have no pity.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.027
That's it exactly.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.489
That's what I want. No pity.

35:58.574 --> 36:01.827
He often hands me the phone
because he forgets.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.747
True, he isn't compassionate.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.125
But he's strong, with arms and legs.

36:08.292 --> 36:11.170
His brain works, he's healthy.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.923
So, all the rest,
given my state, as you call it,

36:15.090 --> 36:17.759
his background and so on,
I don't give a shit.

36:19.261 --> 36:20.762
As you wish.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.392
Will that be all?

36:29.104 --> 36:30.105
Magalie...

36:30.981 --> 36:32.774
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.068
I want to show you something.

36:35.944 --> 36:36.945
What is it?

36:37.112 --> 36:39.281
Chill, you can always say no.

36:39.448 --> 36:41.658
One minute then.

36:47.956 --> 36:48.957
So?

36:49.124 --> 36:50.417
So I have a bathtub.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.628
That's all.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.088
Very interesting.

36:57.049 --> 37:00.719
- And...
- We could take a bath.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.471
There's plenty of room.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.973
I have bath salts and foam.

37:08.227 --> 37:09.394
Why not?

37:11.104 --> 37:12.231
Yeah. Why not?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.734
Go on then, get undressed.

37:15.901 --> 37:16.902
Look at you!

37:17.069 --> 37:19.112
The saucy kind. I like it.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.573
OK, I'll get undressed.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.453
What?

37:27.371 --> 37:29.122
Where are you going?

37:29.289 --> 37:30.582
You said yes!

37:31.541 --> 37:32.960
Just a quick rinse!

37:37.297 --> 37:38.298
What's with you?

37:38.465 --> 37:41.426
I'm always tense
when the mail arrives.

37:43.053 --> 37:44.846
As Apollinaire said:

37:45.013 --> 37:50.894
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter from you..."

37:51.061 --> 37:52.896
Slower, you're losing me.

37:53.063 --> 37:56.149
I'm at "As Apollinaire said:"

37:56.316 --> 37:58.610
"I despair as I yearn
for a letter..."

38:01.446 --> 38:05.242
You may not realize,
but this is private.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.661
No, I didn't realize.

38:07.828 --> 38:08.912
Give me that.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.872
Only if you explain.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.041
There's nothing to explain.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.168
He writes letters.

38:15.877 --> 38:16.920
Letters?

38:17.087 --> 38:18.046
Who to?

38:18.213 --> 38:19.923
Usually to women.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.174
Come on, who?

38:23.468 --> 38:25.762
One in particular. Eléonore.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.223
Who? We've never seen her.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.850
How come?

38:30.017 --> 38:31.727
It's an epistolary relationship.

38:36.023 --> 38:39.651
Meaning they write to each other.
They correspond solely by mail.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.445
No need to spell it out.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.408
The blue envelopes?

38:49.578 --> 38:51.079
He's hot stuff.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.789
He epistoles.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.751
How about you?

38:56.376 --> 38:57.627
No lover in sight?

38:59.254 --> 39:01.089
Albert the gardener, say?

39:01.256 --> 39:02.507
Certainly not!

39:02.674 --> 39:06.219
I've seen the longing looks
he gives you.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.764
Am I wrong? Yes or no?

39:08.930 --> 39:11.350
Stop it, it's ridiculous.

39:12.642 --> 39:13.810
Has he slipped it to you?

39:13.977 --> 39:15.729
- What?
- His little cucumber.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.733
What?

39:21.485 --> 39:22.819
I must be dreaming.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.196
Albert, Albert.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.531
He will soon.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.657
He will soon.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.012
Shit!

39:55.769 --> 39:56.853
Are you OK?

40:02.442 --> 40:03.693
Want some music?

40:27.801 --> 40:28.844
It's all right.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.346
Calm down.

40:49.573 --> 40:50.991
Take it easy.

40:51.158 --> 40:52.534
Try to breathe slowly.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.330
You're with me.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.377
Take it easy.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.342
Try to breathe slowly.

41:14.014 --> 41:15.223
It's all right.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.416
I need air!

41:42.125 --> 41:43.335
I need air!

42:16.201 --> 42:17.369
Shit!

42:22.874 --> 42:24.584
It's good to breathe.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.088
What time is it?

42:28.255 --> 42:30.173
I don't know. Around 4:00 a.m.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.886
It's ages
since I saw Paris by night.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.764
What happened?

42:37.931 --> 42:39.558
The medication has its limits.

42:41.268 --> 42:43.436
Doctors call them phantom pains.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.776
I feel like a frozen steak
tossed onto a red-hot griddle.

42:51.653 --> 42:54.197
I feel nothing but suffer anyway.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.494
Surely something could help.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.666
That could.

43:07.919 --> 43:12.215
We're all sick for that,
me worse than you probably.

43:14.801 --> 43:18.513
I wanted to ask you...
With women...

43:18.680 --> 43:20.724
How do you manage?

43:22.642 --> 43:23.852
You adapt.

43:24.019 --> 43:26.354
So can you do it or not?

43:26.521 --> 43:28.189
You may not realize,

43:28.356 --> 43:31.901
but I feel nothing
from my neck to my toes.

43:32.611 --> 43:34.195
So you can't.

43:36.531 --> 43:38.366
It's not that simple.

43:38.533 --> 43:41.369
I can, but it's not my decision.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.705
And you can find pleasure elsewhere.

43:43.872 --> 43:44.873
Yeah?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.291
You've no idea.

43:46.458 --> 43:49.544
You're right. How, for example?

43:50.045 --> 43:51.796
For example, the ears.

43:53.965 --> 43:54.883
The ears?

43:55.050 --> 43:59.387
The ears are a highly sensitive
erogenous zone.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.514
You get your ears licked?

44:03.975 --> 44:05.602
I'd never have guessed.

44:09.439 --> 44:10.440
Philippe?

44:25.455 --> 44:27.957
- Try this. It'll help.
- What is this crap?

44:28.583 --> 44:30.043
It can't hurt you.

44:31.419 --> 44:32.504
Drag on it.

44:32.671 --> 44:33.880
Go on, drag on it.

44:35.298 --> 44:37.342
Take it easy. Share it.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.595
Again.

44:44.474 --> 44:45.392
One more time.

44:45.558 --> 44:46.935
That's enough for now.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.815
Sorry, but you really get off
with your ears?

44:51.981 --> 44:55.944
If your ears are red,
that means you're turned on?

44:56.111 --> 44:57.570
Exactly.

44:57.737 --> 45:00.573
Sometimes they're hard when I wake.

45:02.909 --> 45:04.452
- Both of them?
- Yes!

45:07.622 --> 45:11.251
I met my wife Alice
when we were students.

45:11.835 --> 45:14.379
She was tall, very elegant,

45:14.546 --> 45:15.839
with laughing eyes.

45:16.631 --> 45:19.259
Is she the blond in the photos?

45:19.968 --> 45:20.885
She's not bad.

45:21.052 --> 45:23.388
What we had was incredible.

45:23.555 --> 45:25.974
I hope you experience that one day.

45:26.725 --> 45:29.894
Fuck, I loved her so much!
I loved her so much.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.449
Then she got pregnant.

45:42.615 --> 45:45.368
Five successive miscarriages.

45:48.788 --> 45:52.625
Then the verdict came in.
An incurable, terminal illness.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.628
We decided to adopt.

46:09.768 --> 46:10.769
Waiter!

46:11.352 --> 46:12.645
Excuse me!

46:14.230 --> 46:15.774
Excuse me!

46:21.196 --> 46:22.197
Yes?

46:23.740 --> 46:26.367
A tarte tatin, please.

46:27.410 --> 46:31.331
Cooked.
The chocolate cake was raw.

46:31.498 --> 46:35.543
It was all squashy and gooey.
Weird.

46:35.710 --> 46:38.755
That's what molten cake is.

46:38.922 --> 46:40.673
- So that's why.
- Yes.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.759
I'll have a tarte tatin anyway.

46:42.926 --> 46:45.261
I've always loved competition,

46:45.428 --> 46:47.555
extreme sports, speed.

46:47.722 --> 46:49.766
Going faster, higher.

46:51.518 --> 46:53.228
A paraglider gave me that.

46:53.394 --> 46:56.815
I was high in the sky,
looking down at things, breathing.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.818
I was raised to think
we pissed on the world.

47:02.070 --> 47:03.947
Some water. My mouth's dry.

47:07.367 --> 47:08.910
The joint does that.

47:10.745 --> 47:12.205
And what else?

47:12.372 --> 47:13.373
Makes you hungry

47:13.540 --> 47:15.667
and chatty.

47:20.672 --> 47:23.716
But bad weather can be fatal
when paragliding.

47:24.759 --> 47:26.594
And you flew anyway?

47:26.761 --> 47:30.723
Yes, maybe to suffer like Alice.
I knew she'd never recover.

47:32.308 --> 47:36.729
I broke the third and fourth vertebrae.
Now only fly in my mind.

47:37.772 --> 47:40.567
When the pain eases,
I have my thoughts.

47:43.111 --> 47:45.738
My real handicap
isn't being in a chair.

47:48.992 --> 47:50.660
It's living without her.

47:53.913 --> 47:56.040
What do the doctors say?

47:56.207 --> 47:59.794
With the advances in medicine,
they'll keep me going to 70

47:59.961 --> 48:02.630
with massages and pick-me-ups.

48:02.797 --> 48:05.758
It's expensive,
but I'm a rich invalid.

48:09.178 --> 48:10.763
I'd have shot myself.

48:10.930 --> 48:13.683
That's not easy in my condition.

48:14.225 --> 48:15.768
True.

48:16.978 --> 48:18.146
That sucks.

48:20.315 --> 48:22.025
What's the date today?

48:22.191 --> 48:23.610
The eighth or the ninth.

48:23.776 --> 48:25.194
It's official then.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.738
What is?

48:26.905 --> 48:28.281
You've won your bet.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.783
Your trial period's over.

48:30.950 --> 48:31.868
I'm hired then?

48:32.035 --> 48:33.786
Yes, you're hired.

48:34.203 --> 48:35.955
Can I count on you now?

48:36.122 --> 48:37.999
- Yes.
- Good.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.793
Start by giving my Fabergé egg back.

48:42.921 --> 48:45.256
Alice gave me one each year.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.217
I have 25, one for each year
we were together.

48:48.968 --> 48:50.303
I cherish it.

48:51.846 --> 48:54.807
I don't know why you...
Wasn't me.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.810
What did you lose again?

49:11.282 --> 49:12.283
Mina!

49:12.492 --> 49:13.493
Mina!

49:16.871 --> 49:18.831
- What's up?
- Get in.

49:20.750 --> 49:21.918
Buckle up.

49:33.346 --> 49:34.722
How's it going?

49:40.895 --> 49:42.313
How's school?

49:44.857 --> 49:46.526
Why don't you text me back?

49:48.528 --> 49:49.779
I was busy.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.284
Let's hear it.
Who called?

49:55.451 --> 49:58.621
A cop, to talk to Mom.
I put on a deep voice

49:58.788 --> 50:00.331
and said we'd go.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.168
Found my egg?

50:07.922 --> 50:09.424
Have you found it?

50:09.590 --> 50:12.635
Screw your stone egg.
I haven't found it.

50:22.270 --> 50:23.479
What did you say?

50:23.646 --> 50:25.398
What could I say?

50:25.565 --> 50:27.900
I only had 30 grams on me.

50:28.067 --> 50:31.320
For that you get a spell in custody,
then it's bye-bye.

50:31.487 --> 50:33.031
Let's get a kebab.

50:33.948 --> 50:35.616
I'm not getting in that!

50:35.783 --> 50:36.784
Let go of me.

50:36.951 --> 50:37.869
Where are you going?

50:38.036 --> 50:40.538
Who's driving you?

50:40.705 --> 50:41.789
Get lost!

50:41.956 --> 50:43.499
It's not your business.

50:43.958 --> 50:45.126
Piss off!

50:57.680 --> 50:58.890
Fuck!

50:59.682 --> 51:02.977
"Her shining eyes
are made of charming minerals

51:03.144 --> 51:05.938
and in this strange,
symbolic world..."

51:06.898 --> 51:09.484
"And in this strange...

51:09.984 --> 51:11.569
...symbolic...

51:12.445 --> 51:13.738
...world..."

51:13.988 --> 51:15.615
Fucking boring!

51:17.450 --> 51:20.745
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

51:21.370 --> 51:23.456
Is that with an "i" or a "y"?

51:23.998 --> 51:25.958
This is killing my mind.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.170
"Sphinx" is with an "i."

51:29.337 --> 51:31.339
Why bother with this crap?

51:32.006 --> 51:34.258
Sphinxes, daisies, angels...

51:34.425 --> 51:36.719
You'd go for this stuff?

51:38.012 --> 51:39.847
True, one could be more direct.

51:41.974 --> 51:44.310
"And ancient sphinx..." Go on.

51:44.477 --> 51:46.145
What's she look like?

51:46.312 --> 51:48.940
I don't know.
That's not what matters.

51:49.732 --> 51:53.444
It's intellectual and emotional,
not physical.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.446
I want a mind-to-mind relationship.

51:55.613 --> 51:59.408
If she's a troll,
it'll be mind-to-troll!

52:00.535 --> 52:02.745
Very subtle. Really.

52:04.539 --> 52:05.540
What can I say?

52:06.332 --> 52:07.250
Bravo.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.335
How long's it been going on?

52:15.174 --> 52:16.926
Please.

52:18.761 --> 52:19.679
Six months.

52:19.846 --> 52:21.305
Six months?

52:21.472 --> 52:23.724
And you've never seen her?

52:23.891 --> 52:27.311
Maybe she's fat and ugly.
Or handicapped.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.815
At the end of the poem
put "How's your weight?"

52:31.649 --> 52:35.570
Thank you very much
for your sound advice, Driss.

52:36.571 --> 52:38.447
Let's carry on. Where was I?

52:39.574 --> 52:42.743
A sphinx was eating daisies
with an angel,

52:42.910 --> 52:44.829
then running and doing stuff.

52:46.038 --> 52:46.956
Let me see...

52:47.123 --> 52:49.917
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

52:50.376 --> 52:54.088
"In this strange,
symbolic world..."

52:54.255 --> 52:55.256
Call her!

52:55.715 --> 52:59.886
"...where the inviolate angel
and ancient sphinx..."

53:00.344 --> 53:01.345
Call her, OK!

53:01.971 --> 53:05.725
I can get more across
with the written word, OK?

53:06.767 --> 53:07.685
He's incredible.

53:07.852 --> 53:11.564
I'm going to find her number.
This is stressing me out.

53:15.151 --> 53:16.694
Dunkirk. That's bad.

53:17.111 --> 53:18.279
Put that down.

53:18.446 --> 53:20.072
No beauty queens there.

53:20.990 --> 53:22.158
Only trolls.

53:22.325 --> 53:23.951
Put that down right now.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.536
Her number's here.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.914
That means she wants you to call!

53:28.080 --> 53:29.957
Put it down, please!

53:30.124 --> 53:32.001
She wrote her number here.

53:32.168 --> 53:35.004
That means:
"Call me, I'll lick your ear."

53:35.463 --> 53:37.840
What's he doing?
Don't call her.

53:38.007 --> 53:40.384
Enough poetry after six months.

53:40.885 --> 53:42.511
He's totally crazy!

53:43.137 --> 53:44.430
I won't speak to her.

53:44.597 --> 53:47.433
I bet she has an accent.
They talk weird up there.

53:47.600 --> 53:48.976
Hang up!

53:49.143 --> 53:50.686
"I want my Philippe."

53:50.853 --> 53:52.230
She's gonna get him.

53:53.689 --> 53:55.107
The voice sounds OK.

54:00.571 --> 54:03.157
Improvise, talk about the daisies...

54:03.532 --> 54:05.785
Eléonore? It's Philippe.

54:06.619 --> 54:11.499
I'm calling because I really wanted
to hear the sound of your voice

54:11.666 --> 54:15.002
and with that first "hello,"

54:15.169 --> 54:17.630
- I'm fulfilled.
<i>- I'll put her on.</i>

54:19.757 --> 54:22.134
Too wordy.
Try simpler sentences.

54:23.552 --> 54:25.012
Eléonore, it's Philippe.

54:25.972 --> 54:27.098
<i>Philippe?</i>

54:27.265 --> 54:29.350
I was writing you a letter and...

54:30.643 --> 54:34.063
...it just hit me,
"Why don't I call her?"

54:34.730 --> 54:36.065
Ask her weight!

54:37.066 --> 54:39.485
<i>- I'm sorry?</i>
- No, nothing.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.028
"I'm in mourning,

54:41.195 --> 54:43.155
I weep, I'm afraid.

54:43.948 --> 54:44.991
Lord, fresh air..."

54:45.157 --> 54:47.535
Yes, "The Foolish Virgin."
You're unbeatable.

54:47.702 --> 54:49.036
I love Rimbaud too.

54:49.203 --> 54:51.122
Sorry, I was here first.

54:51.289 --> 54:53.666
Eléonore, I'm so happy.

54:55.209 --> 54:56.627
What a chatterbox!

54:56.794 --> 54:58.921
There's no stopping you now.

54:59.088 --> 55:00.423
Take care.

55:01.215 --> 55:03.718
Let's all take care,
let's all lick our ears.

55:03.884 --> 55:04.969
Excellent.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.637
Well?

55:07.680 --> 55:10.182
Good news and not so good news.

55:10.766 --> 55:11.767
The good news?

55:11.934 --> 55:13.060
Fifty-three kilos.

55:13.227 --> 55:15.062
Fifty-three kilos, that's good.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.564
Unless she's one meter tall.

55:18.274 --> 55:21.444
The bad news is, she wants a photo.

55:21.986 --> 55:24.113
- So?
- Very funny.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.532
Your tickets, please.

55:26.699 --> 55:27.616
Good evening.

55:27.783 --> 55:28.784
Right here.

55:28.951 --> 55:30.578
- OK.
- Have a good evening.

55:30.745 --> 55:33.247
If you want us,
we won't move from there.

55:33.414 --> 55:34.957
Especially him.

55:37.543 --> 55:40.338
What do you think women want?

55:40.504 --> 55:41.756
I don't know.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.508
Beauty, charm, elegance...

55:45.259 --> 55:48.387
Bullshit!
They want dough and security.

55:49.889 --> 55:51.390
Just ask him.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.977
And you have what it takes.

55:56.270 --> 55:57.188
I'm naïve.

55:57.355 --> 56:00.983
I hope to charm with more
than just my bank account.

56:02.276 --> 56:06.280
After six months reading
your lame poems, she's hot for you.

56:06.447 --> 56:10.117
She's an original all right.
The chair won't bother her.

56:11.285 --> 56:12.411
That's true.

56:13.329 --> 56:15.623
Up north,
guys drink and beat women.

56:15.790 --> 56:17.416
She'll be safe with you.

56:17.833 --> 56:19.001
Bastard.

56:20.753 --> 56:22.129
Pragmatic, right?

56:24.048 --> 56:25.299
I don't know.

56:25.966 --> 56:29.261
If she sends her photo,
it means she wants to go further.

56:30.429 --> 56:33.516
Send a photo of you
without the chair really showing.

56:33.682 --> 56:36.185
It doesn't have to be
a telethon one

56:36.352 --> 56:38.396
with you drooling

56:38.562 --> 56:41.065
and looking like shit.

56:41.232 --> 56:43.067
OK, I get the message.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.958
This guy's not well.
He's not at all well.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.085
What?

57:05.005 --> 57:06.215
He's a tree?

57:07.174 --> 57:08.300
A singing tree.

57:15.516 --> 57:16.976
That's German!

57:18.310 --> 57:19.311
What?

57:20.354 --> 57:21.689
It's in German.

57:21.856 --> 57:23.065
In German.

57:24.358 --> 57:25.776
You're a nutcase.

57:26.777 --> 57:27.903
What a drag.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.697
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

57:29.864 --> 57:30.948
Fuck!

57:35.369 --> 57:36.996
Good-looking back then.

57:38.873 --> 57:39.874
Which one?

57:42.585 --> 57:43.794
This one.

57:47.506 --> 57:50.092
Or maybe this one.

57:50.718 --> 57:55.264
Sure, there's a problem,
but you look good.

57:56.390 --> 57:57.600
Wanna try it?

57:57.766 --> 57:58.809
I don't know.

57:59.393 --> 58:02.229
- Wasn't it a blast talking to her?
- Yes, it was.

58:02.396 --> 58:03.397
That's all?

58:03.814 --> 58:05.691
- A fucking blast.
- So?

58:06.567 --> 58:09.153
Put the damn photo in an envelope!

58:09.320 --> 58:12.615
There.
The very words I wanted to hear.

58:17.119 --> 58:18.370
Gimme a cig.

58:19.079 --> 58:20.539
Don't you ever knock?

58:21.332 --> 58:22.333
You're painting?

58:22.666 --> 58:24.960
- Get out.
- Seriously? You're painting?

58:25.127 --> 58:26.670
Learned to read too?

58:26.837 --> 58:29.131
What do you want?
Get lost!

58:29.298 --> 58:31.091
Going to hit a woman?

58:31.258 --> 58:32.635
You do that in your country?

58:32.801 --> 58:34.553
You're whacked! Get out.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.347
- Get out now!
- I'll go when I want.

58:36.514 --> 58:37.973
Get the hell out!

58:38.140 --> 58:40.184
- I've decided to go now.
- Get out!

58:40.935 --> 58:41.894
Shit.

58:42.061 --> 58:44.396
Replace that photo with the other.

58:46.732 --> 58:49.944
Make sure to post it yourself.
And be discreet.

58:50.444 --> 58:51.987
As you wish.

58:52.905 --> 58:55.282
Put the other photo in the trash.

58:55.658 --> 58:56.825
I'm blowing a fuse!

58:57.117 --> 58:59.328
HOOKERS

59:02.456 --> 59:04.542
- What's wrong?
- Your daughter!

59:05.376 --> 59:06.377
I was painting.

59:07.002 --> 59:08.754
You were painting?

59:08.921 --> 59:10.422
I'm telling you,

59:10.631 --> 59:13.217
set her straight
or I'll demolish her!

59:13.384 --> 59:15.844
- Calm down.
- No, I won't calm down!

59:16.220 --> 59:18.055
I'm your arms and legs here?

59:18.472 --> 59:21.308
- That's right.
- I want to be your hands

59:21.475 --> 59:25.104
to give her a slap
'cause all you can do is run her down!

59:25.271 --> 59:28.440
Aren't you overdoing it?
Yvonne?

59:34.238 --> 59:37.074
She could do
with being set straight a bit.

59:37.241 --> 59:38.284
A bit?

59:38.450 --> 59:40.369
At 16, she dresses like a tramp!

59:40.536 --> 59:43.163
She keeps making out
with mop-head.

59:43.497 --> 59:45.124
But that's not my problem.

59:45.291 --> 59:49.336
What bothers me
are her high and mighty airs,

59:49.503 --> 59:51.422
the way she talks to you and me.

59:51.589 --> 59:54.466
No respect.
She treats us like dogs.

59:55.593 --> 59:58.137
Say the word and I'll set her straight.

59:58.304 --> 59:59.471
I get the message.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.473
Let me talk to her.

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:06.478
So talk to her, and fast.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.690
Do something.
Set her straight.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.484
He paints? What does he paint?

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.403
No idea.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:36.592
Wake up.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:38.510
Rise and shine.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.517
Here we go.
Power-hose time.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:32.022
Respect the people
I need around me.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.649
It's intolerable.

01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:35.150
<i>Is that clear?</i>

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.027
Be tougher on her!

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.571
I don't want that mop-head around.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:42.157
- Give me a break.
- I'm not through!

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:45.160
I have to run you down
to get you to obey?

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:47.579
There, he's done it!

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.210
You painted this?

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:54.378
Yeah.

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:56.505
I love it.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.759
I'm not saying
I'd necessarily hang it

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.302
in my place, but...

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.347
What can we get for it?

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:08.892
We'll see.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.478
See more or see less?

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.856
It's...

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.400
Are you nuts?

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.402
C'mon! No tongues, OK.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:19.695
You're sick in the head!

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:22.781
I don't believe this.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:24.491
Speed it up a bit.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.868
I'm flat-out.

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.496
You're way too slow!

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.874
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.125
That's cool.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.418
Twelve kilometers an hour is cool,
right?

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:36.879
No faster?

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:38.630
- That's the top speed.
- OK.

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.291
Stick to the ears.

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:36.605
Yes, Yvonne.

01:03:36.772 --> 01:03:39.066
No, he can't hear.
He's nowhere near me.

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:41.527
He can't hear me, Yvonne.

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:45.948
We'll be there at 8:30 sharp.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:47.157
We'll push it back.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.992
Goodbye, Yvonne.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.078
She's stressed out?

01:03:51.245 --> 01:03:54.748
Yes, your birthday surprise
will be half an hour later.

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:58.460
She gets into a terrible state
every year.

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:01.922
She invites my whole family.
It all goes like clockwork.

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:06.510
They come to see
if I'm still alive.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.470
The annual check-up.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.100
I pretend to be surprised.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:15.394
We all make an effort,

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:17.729
but, to be honest,
we all get bored shitless.

01:04:57.436 --> 01:04:58.437
Excuse me...

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.480
Excuse me...

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.613
Do you mind moving along?

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:10.240
Yes, I do mind.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:11.366
All right.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.577
Thank you. Move along.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.788
Move just one seat along.

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.499
Very kind.

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:32.804
A suit changes a man.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.474
You look good.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.061
You look like Obama.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:41.855
Yeah?

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.693
She's hot for me, I can tell.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.236
Barack Obama.

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:49.529
Classy.

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:55.661
That's like comparing you...

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:57.829
...to George Bush...

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.123
...or Nixon.

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:12.260
What's up? You'll miss the concert.

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:13.637
Leave me alone!

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:16.056
Got your period?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.599
Piss off!

01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:18.809
What's wrong?

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:20.936
Elisa...

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.898
- Leave me be!
- What did you take?

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:27.859
What did you do?

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:31.947
Where's this from?

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:33.740
Yvonne's purse.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:34.908
Imodium?

01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:37.369
What was this for?

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:38.954
To kill yourself?

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.373
You won't shit for months now!

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:42.874
Leave me alone.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.251
Hold on...

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:47.671
You took Tylenol too?
You're dying.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:48.922
This is bad!

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.843
Shall I call an ambulance?

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:54.553
Why did you do it?

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:57.055
Because of Bastien.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:58.765
What about him?

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:01.268
He dumped me,
he doesn't give a shit.

01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:03.311
He even called me a slut.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.855
That's bad.

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:07.441
It'd suit everyone if I died.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.776
Stop talking crap. Come downstairs.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:12.654
Go to see him for me.
Talk to him.

01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:13.739
Who?

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.824
Bastien. I'll pay you.

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:18.243
Pay me? Are you out of your mind?

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.537
Spare me this childish shit.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:21.788
Please!

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.458
I talk to Bastien
and you pay me.

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:26.918
Who do you think I am?

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.464
Driss, please!

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.758
How much?

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:35.927
Jerk.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:41.933
It has style.
There's a certain touch.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:45.312
But 11,000 for an unknown artist...

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:54.321
But if I say no
and the value triples, I'll regret it

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:56.406
and you'll say, "I told you so."

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.578
He has a show in London?

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.038
And Berlin soon.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.040
Berlin too.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.961
I don't know.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.548
Eleven thousand euros
is quite a sum.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.676
<i>Come on, fill me in here.</i>

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.261
Is she with someone?

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:21.264
All right. Yes. Fred.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.432
Fred?

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.018
They've been together two years...

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:27.979
...but with ups and downs.

01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:29.981
Things are often tense.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.984
They're pretty rocky now.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.487
Maybe because of me?

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.988
- Has she mentioned me?
- No.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:41.451
Of course. A little.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.912
Fuck! She's hot for me.

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:48.375
You're bullshitting me?

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.627
- No.
- Bullshit away!

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.671
I'll bed Magalie one day.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:54.589
Hope keeps us going.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.385
Easy on those
if you have stomach trouble.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:00.720
I'm no doctor,

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.305
but Imodium means there's a problem.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:14.901
Excuse me.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.863
Can I ask a favor of you?

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.323
One more piece just for me?

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.868
No, we were cool.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:26.453
Vivaldi's <i>Four Seasons:</i>

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.372
"L'Estate."

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.666
You'll like this.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.209
Shit.

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:50.020
Come on,
don't tell me you feel nothing.

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:53.857
Not a thing.
It doesn't do a thing for me.

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:56.109
Music's something you dance to.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.570
Let's try something else.

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:06.453
I know that one.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.079
That's an ad.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.123
For coffee.

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:17.964
Oyez, by mandate,

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.800
I'm expected at the chateau...

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.137
...to bring the minstrels there.

01:10:25.764 --> 01:10:26.890
I'm a good knight.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.477
That one's fishy.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.188
I see people without clothes.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:37.984
They're running.
I see them running naked.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.277
And giggling.

01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:42.072
All right.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.281
Bach was hot.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.702
Women went for him.
The Barry White of his day.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.790
I know this one!

01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:54.042
I know it. Everyone knows it.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.543
Sure!

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.672
"This is the Paris Benefit Office.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.132
All our lines are currently busy.

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:03.301
Waiting time: Two years."

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.103
"Tom and Jerry," right?

01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:21.820
"Tom and Jerry."

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:24.823
What a jerk.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.158
Someone help me.
A masterpiece.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.620
OK, after your classics,

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.163
let's listen to mine.

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:34.124
Earth, Wind & Fire.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.292
It's a killer.

01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:40.255
Something else, huh?

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:42.757
Definitely something else.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.177
Call my name, I won't answer.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.764
- Driss!
- I'm not answering.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.182
Here we go.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:25.759
It's a birthday party!

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.427
Let's dance!
Come on, move!

01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:29.304
It's his birthday!

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:31.806
Yeah, Yvonne.

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.058
Ace, Albert.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.237
Spin! Spin!

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:23.817
All right.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.277
Time for my little gift.

01:13:27.362 --> 01:13:29.572
I didn't want to spoil things

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.325
if she turned out to be ugly.
You never know.

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:34.285
She answered anyhow.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.162
Good night.

01:13:38.373 --> 01:13:40.834
I'll open it. You'll take ages.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.004
Well?

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:48.967
- She's not a troll.
- Really?

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.386
Shit.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.055
The only one in Dunkirk
with all her teeth!

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:56.182
There's a note too.

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:58.935
"I'll be in Paris next week.

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.396
I'll be expecting your call."
And three dots!

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:04.691
Meaning what?

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.610
- Any idea?
- It's a good sign?

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.654
You bet. She wants nooky.

01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:12.532
Three dots. One, two and three dots.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:13.950
"She wants nooky."

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.077
I'm getting nooky.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:18.746
It's looking good.

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.206
How can I sleep now?

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.292
You'll manage.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:24.043
I'll put her here.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.421
She'll watch you sleep.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.674
Good night, Philippe.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.051
Sweet dreams.

01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:45.815
Try the cap again.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.777
Not bad.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.780
No way!
He looks like a farmer.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.366
- Go for traditional.
- That's what I said.

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.119
- How's this?
- No good. Too traditional.

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:01.372
Forget the caps and hats,
find something.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:04.334
Traditional or trendy?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.252
That's it.

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.670
This works.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.547
The angler look?

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:11.633
We're off to Dunkirk.

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.637
I'll go with Yvonne. We'll be fine.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:16.804
You sure?

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.392
Yes, I'll manage.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:22.644
Fine.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.483
I'm a bit stressed out.

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:31.402
It doesn't show. You look great.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.241
4ac minus b².

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:37.617
- Minus b²?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.784 --> 01:15:39.285
I got 20 instead.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:40.537
Come here, you.

01:15:41.663 --> 01:15:43.498
Take a hike, Justin Bieber.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.667
Recognize me, Bastien?

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.335
Yeah. What's up?

01:15:47.502 --> 01:15:49.504
You said a bad thing to Elisa.

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:51.172
- I said nothing.
- Shut up!

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.841
Act like a man and apologize.

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.134
OK, I'm sorry.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:56.302
Hands off.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.471
- Not to me, to her.
- Right.

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:01.015
Bring her croissants each day.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.850
- Plain or chocolate?
- What?

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.269
Plain or chocolate?

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.562
Whatever.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.313
Just do it right.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.023
You're nice to her.

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:10.316
Now piss off.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:11.859
Go on, get lost.

01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:13.861
And try using a barrette!

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.158
What time is it?

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.370
It's 4:45.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.421
Let's take the cap off.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:34.215
Good idea.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:44.392
Now what time is it?

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:48.187
Forty-six or 47.
Time doesn't move very fast.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.690
I'd like a whisky.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:32.398
Another.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.108
Is that a good idea?

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:35.610
A double!

01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:40.865
Waiter, a double whisky, please.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:13.231
<i>Driss?</i>

01:18:13.398 --> 01:18:15.274
Am I disturbing you?

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.443
<i>I'm at the gym. Well?</i>

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:20.071
Do you feel like getting away?

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:22.323
<i>No questions asked?</i>

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:23.574
No questions, no.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.411
- You want to split?
<i>- Exactly.</i>

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:28.413
And go where?

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.249
To breathe a little.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:33.376
Breathe a little?

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.754
I'll shower and be right there.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.300
We're leaving. The cap...

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:42.927
It's only just six...

01:18:43.094 --> 01:18:44.137
We're leaving!

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.009
Good evening.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:32.977
Give him some champagne
to help him relax.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:34.645
I'm not tense.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.022
- You're not?
- No.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.416
It's just us?

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.294
No other people on board?

01:19:58.461 --> 01:19:59.670
Just us?

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.484
I don't like this.

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:22.652
Why not?

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:24.779
I don't know.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.574
Because you seem kind of jinxed.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.536
The accident, the wheelchair,

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:32.703
your wife...

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:35.289
Sounds like the Kennedys.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.584
Miss?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.921
Could we have the package please?

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:43.089
Thank you.

01:20:47.927 --> 01:20:48.928
Thank you.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.222
Why?

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:00.857
What the hell?

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:04.902
Your value on the art market.
I managed to get 11,000 euros.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.614
Keep at it. You have talent.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:11.367
That's a great deal.
I sensed something.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.161
It all came about instinctively.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:18.207
With the music playing,
it made for a really good blend.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:22.211
It was a sort of revelation,
like I saw the light.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:23.546
Don't get carried away.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:26.382
Eleven thousand
for my first painting!

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:28.426
What was that?

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.512
Just a hole in the fuselage.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:32.930
We won't make it.

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.099
Tell me what's up!

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:39.020
- Glad to have known you.
- Not funny.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:43.399
I know you're used to tragedy,
but I'm not.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.642
You gotta be nuts to do that.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:18.851
A little.

01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:26.525
I have to say something.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:29.362
You're a total headcase.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:30.905
Really?

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.117
Now get Driss ready.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.705
Sure. No way I'm doing that.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:42.458
I'll be over there taking photos.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.001
"Get Driss ready!"

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:46.337
How will you take photos?

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:48.839
Laugh. I'm not doing it.

01:23:00.101 --> 01:23:01.310
Holy shit.

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:03.771
I'm not going.

01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:05.773
- Hold on.
- How do I get this off?

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.693
I don't have to do it.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:18.577
I'm not doing this!

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.913
I lost my fucking shoe!

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.581
My shoe's down there.

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:27.461
Motherfucker!
We're heading up!

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:39.974
What the fuck!

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:42.393
- What's going on?
- Hey, Driss.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:46.439
Relax, pal.

01:23:47.148 --> 01:23:49.859
I'm relaxed,
but I want to be down there.

01:23:54.405 --> 01:23:56.407
Fucking hell!

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:03.706
I'm having a blast!

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:40.326
Where do you find an invalid?

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.412
- I don't know.
- Where you leave him.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.207
That's a good one.

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:48.918
Bastard.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.422
Someone for you, Driss.

01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:58.302
What are you doing here?

01:24:58.469 --> 01:25:01.097
I should ask you that.
You kept this quiet.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.515
How did you know?

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.226
Benefit sent this, with the address.

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.311
What's that?

01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:08.854
Forget it.

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.981
- What happened?
- I fell off a scooter.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.650
You fell off a scooter?

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:15.069
Get up.

01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:16.987
You fell... Come here.

01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:22.451
Shit!

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:27.498
You sleep here?

01:25:28.374 --> 01:25:30.876
- So what happened?
- Nothing.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:32.294
Come on, tell me.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:34.046
Not your problem.

01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:36.507
You're here, it's my problem!

01:25:36.674 --> 01:25:39.385
We got screwed.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.

01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:40.719
No fucking way!

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.012
Does the old lady know?

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.722
No, I'm handling it.

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:46.225
You're handling fuck all!
Quit busting my balls!

01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:48.769
Don't touch anything. Wait here!

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.479
Can I lie down?

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.481
Don't touch a thing!

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.233
OK, I get it!

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:55.985
Watch it, OK!

01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:01.824
No, he's with me.

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:04.034
Quit crying, Mina.

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:06.328
It's just a scratch.

01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:08.080
No, he's fine.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:10.416
Calm down, no one's killing no one.

01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:13.043
That's all just empty threats.

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:16.589
I can't take care of him.
I gotta work.

01:26:17.006 --> 01:26:19.675
No, you don't tell her about it.

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:22.678
Stay in your room
if you want to cry.

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:32.605
Time for bed?

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:35.149
I'll stay up a while longer.

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:37.443
Sit down.

01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:40.738
Sit down here.

01:26:49.163 --> 01:26:50.873
What do you think of her?

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.961
- She looks hot.
- OK. And what else?

01:26:57.338 --> 01:26:59.882
Let's go up.
I need to do something.

01:27:00.049 --> 01:27:02.092
I imagine her standing up,

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:06.096
turning around
and I discover her face at last.

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:12.937
The boy looks like you.
Adama, is that right?

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:14.104
That's right.

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:16.440
I spotted him earlier.

01:27:16.607 --> 01:27:18.692
If I passed him on the street,

01:27:18.859 --> 01:27:20.945
I'd know he was your brother.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.988
That's funny.

01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:25.074
Why?

01:27:25.241 --> 01:27:26.825
He's not my brother.

01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:29.536
He isn't?

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:31.747
It's complicated.

01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:35.417
Is he your brother or not?

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:43.050
OK, I get the message.

01:27:44.093 --> 01:27:45.302
Come on, let's go.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.270
My parents...

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:57.481
...aren't my parents.

01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:00.109
They're my uncle and aunt.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.570
They fetched me from Senegal
when I was eight.

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:08.158
They couldn't have kids
but a brother had loads.

01:28:08.826 --> 01:28:10.160
They picked the oldest.

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:12.288
Me.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.167
My name's Bakary.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.670
That's my real name.

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:23.048
But other kids had that name
so they called me Idriss

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.092
and that became Driss.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.053
And afterwards?

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.473
Out of the blue,
my mother... my aunt

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.059
got pregnant once
and then twice.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.061
Then my uncle died.

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:37.938
Other men, other kids.

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:40.190
Like I said, complicated.

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:45.195
Young Adama...
doesn't he need setting straight?

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.248
He came to get you, right?

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:01.253
Driss...

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:06.592
I think we'll call it quits.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:10.721
You can't be pushing an invalid
for the rest of your life.

01:29:11.722 --> 01:29:15.225
After all your hard work,
you've earned your benefit.

01:29:20.773 --> 01:29:23.233
Come on, let's go.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:26.403
Right.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:31.658
Bassari Bakary,

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:33.118
Bakary Bassari.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:36.121
It's beautiful.
It sounds like poetry.

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:40.167
Almost like alliteration.
You know what alliteration is?

01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:41.335
No.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:47.716
Hello, Bastien.
See you tomorrow.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:50.677
We'll need a few more for brunch.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.430
OK. Goodbye, Yvonne.

01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:55.516
- You got my sugar puffs?
- Yes.

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:57.101
Thank you.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:59.269
- Say hi to Elisa.
- See you tomorrow.

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:01.313
Hey, Bastien, pal, what's up?

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.481
Come here!

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:11.240
You're leaving then?

01:30:12.366 --> 01:30:15.786
It's OK, I have your number.
We'll stay in touch.

01:30:16.537 --> 01:30:18.789
It won't be easy, but be strong.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:22.835
Too bad, I'm getting your room.
Water damage in mine.

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.712
Maybe I'll stay then.

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:27.756
We'll have to squeeze up.

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:32.177
It'll be a bit cramped.
I don't live alone.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.096
Here.

01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:36.390
Meet Frédérique.

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:40.853
Hey.

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:46.316
All right.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:47.609
What?

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:48.944
I get it.

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.447
So that's it. You're...

01:30:51.989 --> 01:30:53.073
Yes.

01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:58.829
I won't kiss you goodbye then.

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.003
I'm not against a threesome.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.218
I'm up for it.
Not now, since I have to go.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:15.762
But I can come back tonight.

01:31:16.597 --> 01:31:17.848
I have to go now.

01:31:18.015 --> 01:31:19.391
I'm kidding.

01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:26.064
Bye, guys.

01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:31.195
Mr. Michel Sabourdi.

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:39.328
Keep it on, channel two.

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:42.498
You're not angry about Magalie?

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.375
No, you had me fooled.

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:48.545
I couldn't figure out
why she kept resisting.

01:31:53.634 --> 01:31:54.801
A goodbye kiss?

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:58.263
All right.

01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:02.392
Yvonne.

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:06.396
Always bullshitting me.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:08.482
See you.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:13.403
Just a second.

01:32:19.368 --> 01:32:21.411
We won't be needing this.

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:25.165
OK, bye.

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:30.671
Get your foot off there.

01:32:30.837 --> 01:32:31.838
Come on.

01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:52.401
Which bank?

01:32:54.403 --> 01:32:59.324
Could you move your car, please?
You're not allowed to park here.

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:00.492
There's a sign.

01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:01.910
I'll move it.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.245
I'll call you back.

01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:08.333
Stop busting his balls.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.793
We're not driving.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.378
Matter of principle.

01:33:15.507 --> 01:33:17.259
Wait over there for me.

01:33:29.563 --> 01:33:30.981
What's going on?

01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:32.899
I'm coming.

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:13.291
I can cancel my date if you want.

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:15.460
No, certainly not. Why?

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:18.255
Go out and have fun.

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:21.508
OK, Yvonne. I'm ready.

01:35:21.675 --> 01:35:23.218
Yes, just a second.

01:35:23.844 --> 01:35:27.472
It's all ready.
You just have to serve it.

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:30.183
If there's a problem, call me.

01:35:34.855 --> 01:35:36.606
You'll call me?

01:35:38.817 --> 01:35:41.653
If you agree,
I'll serve you your dinner.

01:35:43.155 --> 01:35:46.158
Take the coat off.
It's like being in a madhouse.

01:35:47.701 --> 01:35:48.702
All right.

01:35:48.869 --> 01:35:50.537
Got a cigarette?

01:35:50.746 --> 01:35:52.456
No, I don't smoke.

01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:53.623
Well, I used to.

01:35:54.249 --> 01:35:57.669
I gave up a short while ago
and, to be honest,

01:35:57.836 --> 01:35:59.546
it would be bad for you,

01:35:59.713 --> 01:36:04.551
even if you don't practice a sport,
for your lungs, your breathing...

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.636
...and so on.

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:10.098
You're not eating?

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.290
Watch what you're doing!

01:37:17.457 --> 01:37:18.708
I'm so sorry.

01:37:19.668 --> 01:37:20.710
What is it?

01:37:21.795 --> 01:37:25.507
You wanted a cranial massage.
Here's Mr. Jacquet.

01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:27.259
Hello, sir.

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:30.220
Get out.
Leave me alone.

01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:33.139
- Get out!
- Is it me?

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:34.432
Not at all.

01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:37.310
He got up in a bad mood.
Well, got up...

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:40.772
"He got up..."

01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:43.233
What a prick. Asshole.

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:46.027
Driss Bassari.

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:47.737
Your turn.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:05.505
You got your license a month ago?

01:38:05.672 --> 01:38:07.257
I'd driven before.

01:38:08.133 --> 01:38:11.303
Mostly on private roads, tracks,

01:38:11.469 --> 01:38:14.764
estates, parking lots.
I'm a good driver.

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:20.020
I read your application.

01:38:20.186 --> 01:38:23.690
You used one word
to describe yourself: Pragmatic.

01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:24.983
Yes.

01:38:25.984 --> 01:38:27.485
That's important.

01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:31.031
There's another idea here
that you forgot to mention.

01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:32.407
Really?

01:38:33.617 --> 01:38:36.369
Maybe you should consider
reading our slogan.

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:38.079
That's an alexandrine.

01:38:38.788 --> 01:38:39.706
I'm sorry?

01:38:39.873 --> 01:38:41.791
May-be you should

01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:45.253
con-si-der read-ing our slo-gan.
Twelve feet.

01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:47.839
It wasn't deliberate.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:50.300
"In time and on time."

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:54.429
And you have Dali's melting clocks
for the artistic side.

01:38:55.722 --> 01:38:56.806
Maybe, yes.

01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:00.268
Do you like art?

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:01.645
Yes.

01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.813
- I like Michelangelo.
- Not bad.

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:06.149
But I prefer the other Turtles.

01:39:18.745 --> 01:39:19.746
I'm coming!

01:39:21.039 --> 01:39:22.165
Just a second!

01:39:26.336 --> 01:39:27.337
Are you OK?

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:30.173
Get the hell out.

01:39:31.091 --> 01:39:32.842
Some water? A compress?

01:39:35.512 --> 01:39:36.513
Get out.

01:39:38.974 --> 01:39:40.266
Get out!

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:49.734
Thanks, Bruno.

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:51.403
Have a good weekend.

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:52.862
See you on Monday.

01:39:53.822 --> 01:39:54.739
What's wrong?

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:56.157
He's in a bad way.

01:39:57.242 --> 01:40:00.036
- Where is he?
- Just now, he was in the garden.

01:40:14.884 --> 01:40:16.886
Hey, what's up, bro?

01:40:18.263 --> 01:40:19.889
What's with the beard?

01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:22.809
Serpico?

01:40:22.976 --> 01:40:24.019
Jean Jaurès?

01:40:24.185 --> 01:40:25.812
A metro station anyhow.

01:40:25.979 --> 01:40:26.980
Victor Hugo?

01:40:28.523 --> 01:40:30.608
You've let yourself go.

01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:32.360
Good thing I'm back.

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:33.611
I'll be right in.

01:41:27.874 --> 01:41:29.209
What do we do now?

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:31.753
You let me handle it now.

01:43:17.025 --> 01:43:18.443
Not bad, huh?

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.176
A quick cut would settle it.

01:43:44.552 --> 01:43:47.096
You're in great shape. I love it.

01:43:50.683 --> 01:43:53.603
OK, you can open your eyes now.

01:43:54.187 --> 01:43:55.313
That's hideous.

01:43:55.813 --> 01:43:56.856
It's hideous!

01:43:57.398 --> 01:43:58.942
- Horrible.
- It suits you.

01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:00.109
No.

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.613
Look! Sleeveless leather vest,

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:06.741
spiked bracelet,
Village People style cap.

01:44:06.908 --> 01:44:09.327
Got it! Freddie Mercury!

01:44:09.494 --> 01:44:11.537
You look just like him!

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:14.624
That's wicked.
You look like an orthodox priest.

01:44:14.791 --> 01:44:15.792
Or a Cossack!

01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:20.046
Come on!

01:44:21.631 --> 01:44:23.258
He's crazy.

01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:25.134
What are you doing?

01:44:26.719 --> 01:44:27.929
I expect the worst.

01:44:28.137 --> 01:44:29.430
No, this one's good. Look.

01:44:33.059 --> 01:44:34.435
My grandfather.

01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:35.687
Really?

01:44:36.062 --> 01:44:38.773
Philippe, this mustache of yours,

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.858
it really turns me on.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:42.402
I'll shave it all off.

01:44:42.568 --> 01:44:43.987
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:44:45.697 --> 01:44:47.824
No, that's not funny.

01:44:50.827 --> 01:44:52.036
<i>Nein!</i>

01:44:52.203 --> 01:44:53.413
That's what you mean.

01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:55.164
No, I don't agree.

01:44:56.082 --> 01:44:58.793
Philippe, very angry.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.170
I'm just your plaything now.

01:45:02.171 --> 01:45:04.340
You'll end up in the loony bin.

01:45:04.507 --> 01:45:06.843
Don't you feel like starting a war?

01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:11.180
I think it's time
to shave all this off now.

01:45:11.764 --> 01:45:13.308
You're having fun?

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:16.060
You bet. How about Nazi invalids?

01:45:16.227 --> 01:45:18.938
It must have been weird
saluting like this.

01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:24.569
You've had your fun now.
Get rid of it.

01:45:37.165 --> 01:45:39.083
A booking in the name of Bassari.

01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:40.793
Table number eight.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:41.961
Follow me, please.

01:45:47.759 --> 01:45:48.885
This way.

01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:14.243
I'm not staying for lunch, Philippe.

01:46:16.412 --> 01:46:18.373
- Why not?
- But you won't be alone.

01:46:19.582 --> 01:46:22.877
Actually, you have a date.

01:46:23.252 --> 01:46:24.754
A date?

01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:26.005
What's going on?

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:29.133
Don't panic. It'll be fine.

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.345
Only this time, you can't split.

01:46:34.597 --> 01:46:35.723
By the way...

01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:38.976
...it took me a while,

01:46:39.143 --> 01:46:40.395
but I found it.

01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:42.939
Give her a kiss for me.

01:46:44.273 --> 01:46:45.274
Driss!

01:46:47.235 --> 01:46:48.236
Driss!

01:46:51.197 --> 01:46:53.574
What's this all about?

01:47:13.428 --> 01:47:14.554
Hello, Philippe.

01:47:55.386 --> 01:47:58.264
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo
now lives in Morocco.

01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:01.851
He has remarried
and has two young daughters.

01:48:05.396 --> 01:48:10.985
Abdel Sellou has his own firm.
He is married, with three children.

01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:34.383
Philippe and Abdel are still very close.
