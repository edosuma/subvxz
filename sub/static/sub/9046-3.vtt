00:00.124 --> 00:02.878
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>
- The tape is going public?

00:03.044 --> 00:04.171
That footage could surface
any minute,

00:04.337 --> 00:06.214
so we can tell Jake, or he can see it
with the rest of the world.

00:06.380 --> 00:08.216
Jenna was in love
with this other guy.

00:08.382 --> 00:09.843
I don't wanna keep secrets from Jake.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.054
I'm not in love
with that other guy anymore.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.932
- Mom, do you wanna tell him?
- I wrote that letter to Jenna.

00:15.139 --> 00:17.517
Good morning, Palos Hillers,
don't forget the assembly

00:17.683 --> 00:19.442
in the school gym this morning.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.632
In my role as part
of a newsome twosome,

00:21.757 --> 00:24.240
I was learning that sometimes
I had to be led...

00:24.524 --> 00:25.067
Rosati.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.115
And sometimes I had to take the lead.

00:34.951 --> 00:38.027
Relationships
were all about compromise...

00:40.957 --> 00:42.406
And restraint.

00:42.531 --> 00:45.170
I was trying to throw myself
into my relationship with Jake

00:45.336 --> 00:47.965
without being the clingy
girlfriend of his past.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.550
But like a uniboob in a sports bra,

00:50.716 --> 00:53.284
I was the one being confined...
By my ex.

00:53.409 --> 00:55.514
He just couldn't accept rejection.

00:57.913 --> 00:59.823
Holla!

00:59.948 --> 01:03.021
V.P. Marks is in the house!

01:03.187 --> 01:05.719
Hey, your grandpa called.
He wants his shirt back.

01:06.023 --> 01:09.199
Yo, shorty, why don't you
try growing a few inches?

01:09.324 --> 01:10.759
Hey, Val, why'd you get
your hair cut?

01:10.884 --> 01:11.905
It looks stupid.

01:12.071 --> 01:15.795
Bullying is no laughing matter.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.996
I wanna thank you all for coming
to this required assembly.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.916
I am pumped to kick off
anti-bully awareness week,

01:23.082 --> 01:27.416
which culminates
with our 5k on Friday.

01:27.541 --> 01:30.518
Anyone acting like a bully this week

01:30.643 --> 01:32.120
will receive a Scarlet "B"

01:32.245 --> 01:36.054
and report to my office for
some serious V.P. discipline.

01:36.220 --> 01:38.056
It stands for vice principal,

01:38.222 --> 01:41.363
my new position, which is no joke.

01:41.488 --> 01:43.688
And neither is dancing for a cause.

01:44.020 --> 01:48.984
Zeus Troupe.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.843
Whoo, go, T!

01:59.368 --> 02:01.261
Way to show off
the honey pot, ladies.

How does that Ricky Schwartz
guy pull so much tail?

02:46.449 --> 02:49.060
- Girls are into cheese.
- No, he's just relentless.

02:49.185 --> 02:53.006
Like Matty, my life had become
a series of new complications.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.592
- Lunch off campus?
- Yeah, good with me. Jenna?

02:55.758 --> 02:58.268
My boyfriend's boy friend
was my secret ex,

02:58.393 --> 03:01.457
and I wasn't sure how to remove
the third wheel from my relationship.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.433
- Great!
- Cool. See you later.

03:09.146 --> 03:12.150
Matty's been acting weird
lately. Have you noticed?

03:12.316 --> 03:15.278
It was hard not to.
Matty was always around.

03:15.444 --> 03:17.197
Do you think he's depressed?

03:17.363 --> 03:19.288
Yeah.
It's probably nothing.

03:19.413 --> 03:24.125
But you're something: Adorable.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.081
Oh, now I'm worried about Matty.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.896
Don't.
He's not your problem.

03:28.021 --> 03:29.084
Matty's my problem.

03:29.388 --> 03:30.732
He's depressed, and it's my fault.

03:30.857 --> 03:32.333
I chose Jake,
and now we can't be alone

03:32.458 --> 03:34.302
without Matty tagging along
trying to tempt me.

03:34.427 --> 03:36.304
The whole situation is weird.

03:36.429 --> 03:39.306
Get over you.
He's not trying to temp you.

03:39.593 --> 03:41.596
He probably feels like the BBF.

03:41.762 --> 03:43.682
Backburner friend.
And I can relate.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.079
Ever since you found Jake

03:45.204 --> 03:46.446
and Ming joined the mafia,
I've been...

03:46.571 --> 03:47.561
I didn't put you on the backburner.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.083
You've been so saran-wrapped
around Jake,

03:49.208 --> 03:50.272
you can't even see it.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.919
I'm not clingy.
Matty is.

03:52.044 --> 03:53.420
Do you want me to be the BBF?

03:53.545 --> 03:54.887
Because I can do that and tell
you what you wanna hear.

03:55.012 --> 03:56.528
No, I want the BFF treatment.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.030
Here it is: Nobody likes a cling-on.

03:59.196 --> 04:01.751
Including my panini.

04:02.033 --> 04:05.397
That's right, I have camel toe.

04:05.522 --> 04:06.246
Soak it in.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.747
Looks like your unitard

04:07.913 --> 04:10.103
is already doing the job.

04:10.228 --> 04:12.502
As Tamara prepared to own up
to her behavior,

04:12.668 --> 04:14.212
I was left to process mine.

04:14.378 --> 04:16.173
Was I unintentionally
being cruel to Matty

04:16.298 --> 04:17.507
by clinging on to Jake?

04:17.673 --> 04:20.511
Give me some space!

04:20.636 --> 04:22.180
Tamara, this is Mrs. Karey.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.350
She's our new guidance
counselor, in training.

04:25.475 --> 04:27.885
You should feel comfortable
opening up to her,

04:28.010 --> 04:29.787
but not so open that you feel exposed

04:29.912 --> 04:33.148
because Mrs. Karey hasn't been
fully vetted just yet.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.610
We don't even know
if that's her real name.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.896
So, Tamara, clearly
you have some issues

04:41.021 --> 04:42.407
relating to Mr. Richard Schwartz.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.243
Yes. Ricky's a piece of [Bleep].

04:45.409 --> 04:47.971
Sounds like you're angry.

04:48.096 --> 04:49.638
That is an understatement.

04:49.763 --> 04:52.207
The pig was publically
deep-throating some skankster.

04:52.332 --> 04:53.668
I believe my response
was appropriate.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.337
Anger is not the answer.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.280
Sometimes we need
a gentle reminder to not let

04:58.405 --> 05:00.383
other people get the better of us.

05:03.260 --> 05:04.554
You're gonna have to be punished
for your behavior.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.255
I went full-metal sequins
in front of the entire school.

05:08.380 --> 05:10.124
Don't you think
the embarrassment on my outburst

05:10.249 --> 05:12.562
is punishment enough?

05:12.728 --> 05:16.063
Yes. And it's gonna take until
the next public nip slip

05:16.188 --> 05:17.651
for you to live it down.

05:18.023 --> 05:19.933
But I have an example to set.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.240
In my new role...

05:23.406 --> 05:26.243
I am responsible
for disciplinary action.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.574
Which is none
of Mrs. Karey's business,

05:28.699 --> 05:30.069
so I'm gonna write it down.

05:54.311 --> 05:55.438
You'll pay me 20 bucks?

05:55.691 --> 05:57.857
I can maybe get 30
by the end of the day.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.235
That would be a bribe,

06:00.401 --> 06:02.262
which would be wrong to take
in either role.

06:02.387 --> 06:05.156
It's illegal... and not nearly
enough money.

06:05.545 --> 06:08.446
Tamara, you will be volunteering
for the 5k run/walk

06:08.571 --> 06:10.161
because you acted like a bully,
and you need to run it off.

06:12.174 --> 06:13.816
I should suspend her.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.143
It's a lot of paperwork.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.388
Hi, I'm a bully working on
letting go of my anger.

06:18.513 --> 06:19.589
Please sign up for the 5k

06:19.714 --> 06:21.047
to help put kids like me in my place.

06:21.213 --> 06:22.674
- You have to read that?
- Yeah.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.967
Every day at lunch.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.136
Hey, Hamilton, you coming to lunch?

06:27.058 --> 06:28.564
Do you want me to stay and help?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.889
I don't want you to feel
like a backburner friend.

06:30.055 --> 06:32.183
I would only relegate a BBF
to working this lame event.

06:32.349 --> 06:33.560
Plus Ming can get me, like,

06:33.726 --> 06:35.204
200 signatures
with her mafia connections,

06:35.329 --> 06:36.829
- so you're off the hook.
- Thanks, t.

06:37.104 --> 06:39.566
But, as your BFF, I must remind you,

06:39.732 --> 06:41.343
be kind.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.862
Don't rub your new romance
in Matty's face.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.196
Nobody likes a Ricky.

06:45.362 --> 06:46.656
I'm not a Ricky.

06:46.822 --> 06:48.183
I didn't wanna rub my relationship

06:48.308 --> 06:49.784
or anything else in Matty's face.

06:50.117 --> 06:53.236
And to prove my point,
I took the back seat...

06:55.948 --> 06:57.292
♪ ♪

06:57.417 --> 07:00.503

And I gave up control.

07:14.499 --> 07:17.276
I was cramped, hungry,
and hot... in the wrong way.

07:17.401 --> 07:18.911
In my attempt
to spare Matty's feelings,

07:19.036 --> 07:20.565
I had sacrificed mine.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.485
My <i>ménage à trois</i> had become
a <i>ménage à faux pas</i>.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.195
I was being constantly reminded

07:25.361 --> 07:26.404
of my lingering attraction to Matty.

07:26.570 --> 07:29.622
But thankfully, three
was a magic number at home

07:29.747 --> 07:31.056
on a good day.

07:31.181 --> 07:33.995
So dad's working late...
Again.

07:36.580 --> 07:39.042
He's just been trying to get
ahead of his crazy workload.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.461
My mom could make excuses all night,

07:41.627 --> 07:43.168
but I knew the truth.

07:43.293 --> 07:44.769
Ever since my dad found out that she

07:44.894 --> 07:47.571
was behind the carefrontation,
he had been avoiding her.

07:47.696 --> 07:50.470
And by avoiding her, I was
getting the residual shaft too.

07:52.468 --> 07:55.446
I think he needs to relax,
take the stress off,

07:55.571 --> 07:59.687
which is why I got him
a special surprise.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.357
You bought dad a hot tub?

08:02.523 --> 08:04.442
It's for the whole family to enjoy.

08:04.608 --> 08:07.237
A hot tub equaled one thing:
Desperation.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.781
My mom was desperate
for my father's attention,

08:09.947 --> 08:11.491
and her secret weapon always involved

08:11.657 --> 08:13.201
less clothing and more skin.

08:17.592 --> 08:18.998
Hello?

08:19.164 --> 08:20.469
I'm signing your parents up
for the 5k.

08:20.594 --> 08:22.604
- Is that cool?
- Is that your dad?

08:22.729 --> 08:24.326
It's Tamara, she wants to know
if you'll run

08:24.451 --> 08:26.256
the 5k against bullies on Friday.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.509
I don't like to sweat in public,

08:27.634 --> 08:29.467
but I'll be happy to make a donation.

08:29.633 --> 08:32.424
Oh, it's so hard to get people
excited about running.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.517
- How was lunch?
- Matty took his shirt off

08:35.642 --> 08:38.268
while playing a video game.
Who does that?

08:38.433 --> 08:40.854
You know, I hate to admit this,
but Matty might be trying to homewreck you.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.772
And I know this because right now,

08:42.938 --> 08:44.190
I'm plotting to wreck Ricky.

08:44.356 --> 08:46.276
No, Matty's not that kind of guy.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.728
Maybe, maybe not.

08:47.853 --> 08:48.987
Rejection brings out the dark side.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.947
Believe me, I know.

08:51.324 --> 08:52.399
I am fully aware that I'm
a loose Cannon right now,

08:52.524 --> 08:54.134
and Matty might be too.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.303
There's no way he's trying
to overtly hurt my relationship.

08:56.428 --> 08:57.871
Jake's his best friend.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.456
Well, I hope you're right,
but pay attention.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.941
When are you hanging out
with Hottie Rosati again?

09:02.066 --> 09:04.011
Tonight, he's coming over
to watch a movie.

09:04.136 --> 09:06.921
- Or get in the hot tub!
- Or get in the hot tub.

09:07.087 --> 09:09.174
Hot tub?
When did you get a hot tub?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.967
- When my mom got desperate.
- I heard that.

09:11.242 --> 09:13.352
My parents are fighting.

09:13.477 --> 09:15.154
Well, if Matty ends up sitting

09:15.279 --> 09:16.922
across from you in it,
then you'll know.

09:17.047 --> 09:18.016
Know what?

09:18.182 --> 09:19.434
That he's trying to sabotage you.

09:20.050 --> 09:23.104
If there's one thing
Matty's not, it's a saboteur.

09:23.270 --> 09:25.064
There's no way he's gonna
wind up in my hot tub.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.400
Let's crank up the heat!

09:27.566 --> 09:29.791
We didn't need to.
I was already boiling.

09:32.251 --> 09:33.830
{pub}Sorry, I thought
we were gonna watch a movie.

09:33.955 --> 09:35.074
He invited himself.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.035
It was clear Matty
wasn't just clinging on to me.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.828
He was clinging on to Jake.

09:38.994 --> 09:42.401
Because if he couldn't have me,
he didn't want Jake to either.

09:42.526 --> 09:43.875
It was textbook sabotage.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.002
- Dude, did you pee?
- No.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.630
I did not pee.

09:56.595 --> 09:58.640
Jenna, can I talk to you?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.099
Gladly.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.435
Why are you sneaking in
through the back door?

10:02.601 --> 10:03.688
I wasn't sneaking.

10:03.813 --> 10:05.146
I was just trying to avoid your mom.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.481
That's sneaking.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.983
Hold up, who's the dad here?

10:09.149 --> 10:11.195
When did we get a hot tub,
and what are you doing in it

10:11.485 --> 10:13.029
with your boyfriend
and your ex-boyfriend?

10:13.195 --> 10:15.490
Secret ex-boyfriend,
and the title's debatable.
