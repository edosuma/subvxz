00:02.080 --> 00:04.080
Sarah and Duck.
QUACK!

00:04.080 --> 00:06.360
Sarah and Duck.
QUACK!

00:07.360 --> 00:09.720
Sarah and Duck.
QUACK!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.760
Sarah and Duck.
QUACK!

00:16.040 --> 00:18.160
This morning, Sarah and Duck

00:18.160 --> 00:21.480
are heading over to Scarf Lady's
house for brunch.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.360
Mm! Brunch!

00:23.360 --> 00:25.160
QUACK!

00:25.160 --> 00:26.800
What's brunch?

00:26.800 --> 00:31.240
Erm, it's a meal somewhere
between breakfast and lunch,

00:31.240 --> 00:33.480
with a bit more chatting. Hmm!

00:37.880 --> 00:39.160
Huh!

00:41.200 --> 00:42.480
THUD!

00:42.480 --> 00:44.440
Ooh! You all right, chap?

00:45.480 --> 00:50.280
Oh, hello! Hello, Scarf Lady!
Oh, goodness me, it's hot.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.320
It's f-freezing!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.880
WIND WHISTLES

00:53.880 --> 00:56.320
Brr. Can I come in?

00:56.320 --> 00:59.960
Oh, yes, sorry, dears.
Get into the warm.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.400
Ooh! Brunch...

01:10.280 --> 01:12.520
Mmm!

01:12.520 --> 01:14.000
Ey-up!

01:14.000 --> 01:19.760
Ah! Warm milk!
That kind of day, in't it?

01:19.760 --> 01:23.200
Ooh, I hope Donkey is OK
out there in his car.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.000
He lives in the shed.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.880
So, what's on the agenda
this morning?

01:28.880 --> 01:33.120
Well, the thing is...
I've been knitting in my sleep.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.160
And last night I made...

01:35.160 --> 01:36.240
this!

01:37.640 --> 01:40.000
What is it?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.160
Oh... No idea, dear.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.320
I've been sleep-knitting a lot more,
recently.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.160
But usually it's something useful!

01:49.160 --> 01:51.960
Huh! Useful.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.560
I see...

01:53.560 --> 01:58.760
Duck sleepwalks sometimes. Yes...
Straight to the breadbin.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.640
QUACK-QUACK!

02:00.640 --> 02:02.160
But there's more!

02:02.160 --> 02:06.440
Every day this week, I've woken
up to find I've made some kind of...

02:06.440 --> 02:09.160
Ooh... ..woolly whatsathingy
in the night!

02:09.160 --> 02:10.960
Can we see them?
QUACK!

02:10.960 --> 02:15.240
Why not? Finish your brunch
and we'll go up to the wood room.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.000
Wool room!

02:18.640 --> 02:20.720
There they are!

02:20.720 --> 02:22.480
Can I eat them now?

02:22.480 --> 02:26.200
No, no, no!
Not until I know what they're for.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.680
Aw, but they look so tasty!

02:29.680 --> 02:35.360
It's OK, Wool. You can help us.
Sorry? Find out what they're for!

02:35.360 --> 02:39.680
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Oh, but, but!

02:39.680 --> 02:42.600
You must be quite the expert,
I imagine.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.920
Well, yes, I am made of wool.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.840
OK, I'll help. Yes!

02:52.800 --> 02:55.960
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, dear,
dear, dear, dear.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.880
It's so chilly out.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.440
Hmm.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.920
Tube...

03:00.920 --> 03:02.080
Ooh!

03:02.080 --> 03:04.360
QUACK!

03:04.360 --> 03:08.960
I don't suppose you knitted
an instruction manual in your sleep?

03:08.960 --> 03:10.920
Er, no. Sorry, dear.

03:10.920 --> 03:16.360
Do you mind, I might just leave you
to it. Bag needs a clean.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.840
No, I do not, MADAM!

03:20.360 --> 03:21.720
QUACK!

03:24.640 --> 03:28.640
Ooh! Maybe it's an elephant-maker!
Perhaps...

03:28.640 --> 03:31.680
But what about all the other bits?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.160
Oh, yeah.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.320
Sorry, Duck. Not an elephant-maker.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.720
I've got it! It is
a girl and duck connector!

03:43.840 --> 03:46.040
Ah!

03:46.040 --> 03:47.320
In you get, Duck.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.160
And you! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

03:52.160 --> 03:58.280
It's a girl, duck
and wool connector.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.200
My word!

04:02.360 --> 04:06.160
So this is what
it's like to have legs!

04:06.160 --> 04:09.040
Hoo-hoo! Legs, go to the door!

04:09.040 --> 04:11.200
No, Duck!

04:12.680 --> 04:15.240
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way!

04:16.920 --> 04:20.600
Oh, legs are trickier
than I thought!

04:21.840 --> 04:24.080
Hmmm.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.240
I know!

04:31.520 --> 04:33.320
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:47.560 --> 04:50.680
Any luck yet? Eeh-eh-ooh...

04:50.680 --> 04:52.680
We're a unicorn!

04:52.680 --> 04:54.680
And that's a big "No".

04:54.680 --> 04:57.560
That certainly makes
use of all the bits.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.360
Very nice, dears.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.560
Eeh-hoo!

05:00.560 --> 05:03.320
Though you sound more like Donkey.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.640
Oh! Ooh! I've got it!

05:05.640 --> 05:07.880
Huh? Quickly! Follow me!

05:15.160 --> 05:17.760
Ooh.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.960
Hee-haww.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.920
HAWW!

05:20.920 --> 05:23.040
Right. Where to start!

05:23.040 --> 05:25.440
Pick one, hope for the best.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.760
OK.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.280
Ooh!

05:38.280 --> 05:40.080
HAWW!

05:46.920 --> 05:48.240
Oh!

05:48.240 --> 05:49.680
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:51.880 --> 05:54.680
QUACK-QUACK!

05:56.560 --> 05:58.200
Aha, yes!

06:10.040 --> 06:12.760
Oh! Woollen Donkey!

06:14.080 --> 06:17.360
So, you'd knitted Donkey
a woollen jumpsuit!

06:17.360 --> 06:21.160
Yes! I suppose I was
so worried about Donkey being cold,

06:21.160 --> 06:23.240
I made it for him in my sleep.

06:23.240 --> 06:27.960
But it was too big to get
done in one bit. Toasty toasty.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.560
HAWW!

06:29.560 --> 06:31.440
Hmm.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.600
Oh, hello.

06:34.760 --> 06:40.200
Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Giddy up, funny horsey!

06:40.200 --> 06:41.960
HAWW!

06:41.960 --> 06:43.320
QUACK-QUACK-QUACK!

06:43.320 --> 06:45.440
Ooh-hoo! Yee-ha!

06:45.440 --> 06:47.160
Sarah and Duck.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.920
QUACK!

06:48.920 --> 06:50.280
Sarah and Duck.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.880
QUACK!

06:51.880 --> 06:53.680
Sarah and Duck.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.520
QUACK!

06:55.520 --> 06:57.160
Sarah and Duck.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.480
QUACK!
