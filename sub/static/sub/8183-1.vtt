01:56.520 --> 01:59.956
Honey, come on over here, sugar buns!

02:03.611 --> 02:06.132
This machine just called me an asshole!

03:11.004 --> 03:12.435
I knock.

03:14.633 --> 03:17.820
Jesus Christ, do you know
how to play this game?

03:18.303 --> 03:19.329
Sure!

03:19.429 --> 03:22.320
Well, then, why don't
you make your last draw?

04:17.482 --> 04:18.841
The bridge is going up!

04:18.942 --> 04:21.963
- It can't be! That light was green!
- Stop!

04:26.658 --> 04:28.636
What the fuck!

04:46.717 --> 04:48.611
Look out!

05:31.257 --> 05:33.946
Far out!

05:42.435 --> 05:44.827
It's gonna bump!

06:09.626 --> 06:16.396
The light's green.
The cross bar never went down.

06:17.009 --> 06:20.495
You goddamn stupid asshole!

06:20.595 --> 06:23.567
Can't you see we've
got a situation here?

06:54.750 --> 06:57.528
So, you get Mickey mantle
over to the baseball game?

06:57.628 --> 07:00.067
You go on and joke all you want.

07:00.631 --> 07:04.731
He hit three balls over the fence.
Once of 'em must've gone 250 feet.

07:11.308 --> 07:14.199
Holy God, look at that thing!

07:14.311 --> 07:15.909
I'll get it.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.101
Handy, you son-of-a-bitch!
I thought you was down in Texas.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.392
No, that was last week.

07:34.995 --> 07:36.594
You like that?

07:36.872 --> 07:40.025
- That's some rig, alright.
- Give her a big drink.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.776
- I gotta have some coffee.
- Right.

07:59.351 --> 08:00.377
- Hey, men.
- Handy.

08:00.477 --> 08:02.953
This damn thing!

08:03.438 --> 08:04.834
What's the matter?

08:05.065 --> 08:07.843
Well, this thing was workin'
just fine a few minutes ago...

08:07.943 --> 08:10.631
and now I can't get pea-turkey on it.

08:11.738 --> 08:15.635
Do you wanna bring me a coffee when
you get done jerkin' on that thing?

08:19.452 --> 08:20.931
Robinson.

08:23.539 --> 08:25.517
Robinson, get in here, boy.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.026
I got eggs on!

08:27.126 --> 08:30.113
I don't give a lady bug!
I want you in here now!

08:30.213 --> 08:33.898
Wanda, shut that radio off
and mind them eggs for Billy!

08:48.478 --> 08:49.993
Your mama!

10:03.006 --> 10:05.701
Steve Gayton, Mr. Hendershot,
Duncan Keller's had an accident.

10:05.801 --> 10:07.993
<i>Shit! What happened to him?</i>

10:08.093 --> 10:10.871
He got diesel in his eyes.
I'll be damned if I know how.

10:10.971 --> 10:14.499
Is that all? Flush his eyes.
Leave me alone.

10:14.599 --> 10:19.246
I got me some talkin' to do in here.
I gotta wipe everybody's ass around here.

10:19.562 --> 10:24.256
Shitty job, but I reckon somebody's
gotta do it. Ain't that right, Bubba?

10:24.859 --> 10:27.553
No. Lemme, lemme get this straight now.

10:27.653 --> 10:31.338
You want me to work for nine hours...

10:31.741 --> 10:33.765
and only clock in for eight?

10:33.868 --> 10:36.259
I know you've been to college, boy.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.803
Screw that... not this kid.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.723
You know what that
star means, don't you?

10:42.959 --> 10:46.945
You ain't that obtuse, are you?
Parole, boy!

10:47.045 --> 10:51.111
Your ass belongs to me or it belongs
to the state of North Carolina.

10:53.343 --> 10:55.701
You've got one hell of a
racket goin' here, ain't you?

10:57.431 --> 11:01.414
Put that back in the rack for me
on your way by, would you?

11:04.894 --> 11:06.705
Thank you, Bubba.

11:10.692 --> 11:12.586
Shit!

11:14.487 --> 11:18.475
Wanda, honey, you want me to
get that cup of coffee myself?

11:18.575 --> 11:20.090
Bill!

11:22.996 --> 11:26.182
It's getting' outta hand in here!

11:26.374 --> 11:28.850
You ain't talkin' about me,
are you honey?

11:33.253 --> 11:35.480
Jesus Christ!

11:41.345 --> 11:44.662
Those eggs comin' pony express or what?

11:45.265 --> 11:47.325
Just a minute, Sir!

12:00.945 --> 12:02.764
- It's biting me! Make it stop!
- What is?

12:02.864 --> 12:05.184
That knife! That knife!

12:05.284 --> 12:07.723
Quick, quick a rag!
Somebody give me a rag!

12:08.036 --> 12:11.437
That knife go rabid on you, sweet thing?

12:12.999 --> 12:15.360
It turned it motor on and it bit me.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.398
- Short circuit, maybe.
- There it goes again!

12:23.092 --> 12:25.781
It's on again!

12:27.887 --> 12:29.288
It's still goin'!

12:29.388 --> 12:32.279
Look at that sucker! Nail it!

13:16.308 --> 13:18.036
Now what?

14:04.183 --> 14:06.078
Safe!

14:11.650 --> 14:14.836
Come on, sodas! I'm buyin'!

14:18.739 --> 14:21.344
You guys can help me
pick stuff up, y'know?

14:27.037 --> 14:30.010
No sodas!

14:43.095 --> 14:44.989
What the hell?

15:00.986 --> 15:02.464
Shit!

15:10.662 --> 15:13.683
Coach, are you okay?

15:16.374 --> 15:18.184
Come on, coach!

16:10.384 --> 16:13.403
You'd better give up, sugar pie.

16:13.509 --> 16:17.194
I haven't been able to get something
since half an hour or so.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.073
I must have a broken antenna
or something.

16:21.183 --> 16:22.960
<i>By the moment the information...</i>

16:23.060 --> 16:25.952
How far you goin' up
the road, sugar pie?

16:29.066 --> 16:31.459
It depends on how long you can
keep your hands to yourself.

16:31.986 --> 16:34.342
What's that, sweet thing?
I didn't quite catch it.

16:36.657 --> 16:40.340
- I said, I don't really know.
- Just driftin', huh?

16:41.951 --> 16:46.930
I know what it's like. I've been
driftin' myself now for about 10 years.

16:47.248 --> 16:49.693
When I started in this business,
about eight years ago...

16:49.793 --> 16:52.321
- Right after I got outta the army...
- I got somethin'.

16:52.421 --> 16:53.739
I bet you did.

16:53.839 --> 16:55.115
<i>...our microwave facilities broke down.</i>

16:55.215 --> 16:59.233
<i>Reports of strange occurrences
are pouringing over wire services.</i>

16:59.344 --> 17:02.039
<i>We'll have further
bulletins as they come in.</i>

17:02.139 --> 17:05.083
<i>But for the moment,
let me repeat this urgent message.</i>

17:05.183 --> 17:07.500
<i>If you are near a major highway...</i>

17:07.599 --> 17:11.286
<i>get away at once! Get away at...</i>

17:13.021 --> 17:16.921
- Shit!
- What's wrong there, sweet thing?

17:18.987 --> 17:20.180
Go in there.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.640
If you don't get your hand off my leg
you're gonna be wipin' your ass...

17:22.740 --> 17:24.385
with a hook the next time
you take a dump.

17:24.909 --> 17:27.978
I swear I never heard no
talk like that when I was a boy.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.269
What the hell are you doing, girl?
What's the matter with you?

17:41.965 --> 17:46.363
Lordy, Lordy, girl!
You goin' crazy or somethin'?

17:46.470 --> 17:48.661
Did you hear anything that man said?

17:50.640 --> 17:53.828
Are you... are you on something?

17:55.228 --> 17:59.257
- Oh, Jesus!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

17:59.357 --> 18:02.924
Don't you go walkin'
away from me like that!

18:03.359 --> 18:04.928
You come back here, girl!

18:05.028 --> 18:07.555
- Come back here and listen to me!
- Sweeten my shorts!

18:07.655 --> 18:11.643
I swear, sometimes I think this old
world forgot what good manners is!

18:11.743 --> 18:14.229
Here I go, give you a ride
in my brand new car...

18:14.329 --> 18:17.515
and look at the garbage
comin' outta your mouth!

18:17.706 --> 18:20.818
Do you know what I think?
I think it's a damn!

18:20.918 --> 18:24.530
Look at what that stuff does to people!

18:24.630 --> 18:28.158
The whole civilization is
about to make them fall.

18:28.258 --> 18:30.901
You think the newspapers are any better?

18:33.304 --> 18:36.707
You know it ain't newspapers that are
gonna save this world or even TV!

18:36.807 --> 18:40.576
I'm tellin' you right here and
now as far as I said, all that's...

18:40.685 --> 18:43.873
- ...from the son, Jesus!
- It ain't full yet!

18:57.953 --> 18:59.975
Shepherd, I shall not want!

19:01.663 --> 19:05.147
- Jesus, what the hell happened here?
- I don't know.

19:18.346 --> 19:20.331
What in the dickens is
goin' on around here?

19:20.431 --> 19:22.125
That's a damn good question, isn't it?

19:22.225 --> 19:24.752
- That was your rig, wasn't it, Handy?
- Yeah.

19:24.852 --> 19:27.837
- Well then, who was drivin' it?
- I don't know.

19:27.937 --> 19:30.625
But he must've been a hot-wire champion.

19:31.022 --> 19:33.000
Hell's bells!

19:53.586 --> 19:54.986
We gotta get some gas.

19:55.086 --> 19:58.072
Well, that's good 'cause
I gotta go to the ladies.

19:58.172 --> 19:59.490
Can I come in and watch?

19:59.590 --> 20:02.118
No, you cannot come in and watch.

20:02.218 --> 20:04.160
Ouch! Shoot!

20:16.232 --> 20:18.340
- Did you see?
- What, honey?

20:22.446 --> 20:24.504
Never mind.

20:42.506 --> 20:44.187
Oh, Jesus!

20:53.515 --> 20:54.911
Curt!

20:58.103 --> 20:59.783
Curtis!

21:00.980 --> 21:02.874
Is he dead?

21:39.057 --> 21:40.833
Great God!

22:04.497 --> 22:06.605
I need some ethyl.

22:17.883 --> 22:20.572
Curt, I don't like this!

22:31.188 --> 22:32.750
Curtis!

22:40.947 --> 22:43.055
Are you dead?

22:44.657 --> 22:46.053
Shit!

23:01.133 --> 23:03.110
My God.

23:39.875 --> 23:43.276
Get in right now!

23:46.547 --> 23:48.573
Go! Go! Go!

24:00.437 --> 24:02.544
The other way! The other way!

24:04.357 --> 24:06.551
Come on, honey!

24:06.651 --> 24:10.215
You stop that yelling! You know I
can't drive when you shout at me!

24:32.216 --> 24:35.189
Boy, ain't this a no
count piece of shit!

24:38.011 --> 24:40.487
You do what I said with that body?

24:41.181 --> 24:43.207
Got him downstairs, sure.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.169
Pretty crispy, Mr. Hendershot.
What happened?

24:46.269 --> 24:48.294
Fucked if I know, Bubba.

24:50.273 --> 24:52.250
Fucked if I know.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.527
So, anybody in there?

26:48.840 --> 26:50.615
No, not now.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.407
You're cute.

26:58.723 --> 27:01.495
Yeah? Am I?

27:01.767 --> 27:03.081
Not that cute.

27:04.395 --> 27:06.586
Well, maybe I'll grow on you.

27:09.108 --> 27:12.877
Look at that. There's nothing!

27:13.696 --> 27:17.595
Did you ever see that much nothing
at ten fifteen in the morning, hero?

27:25.455 --> 27:27.266
Name's Bill.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.640
Hi, Bill. Brett.

28:04.325 --> 28:06.644
<i>Although microwave relays...</i>

28:06.744 --> 28:08.938
<i>was knocked out since
nine o'clock this morning...</i>

28:09.038 --> 28:13.026
<i>this frightening mechanical revolt
appears to be occurring everywhere.</i>

28:13.126 --> 28:16.029
<i>Europe, London, New Delhi, Moscow...</i>

28:16.129 --> 28:19.905
<i>The reports we have are the same.</i>

28:20.005 --> 28:22.950
<i>Machines apparently
operating themselves...</i>

28:23.050 --> 28:26.486
<i>are under the direction of an
agency we don't understand...</i>

28:26.595 --> 28:29.070
<i>are going on a homicidal rampage.</i>

28:56.164 --> 28:58.900
<i>Some cities are waking
more slowly than others.</i>

28:59.000 --> 29:01.277
<i>Only one thing is completely
certain this morning.</i>

29:01.377 --> 29:03.821
<i>And that is...
no machine is to be trusted.</i>

29:03.921 --> 29:05.865
<i>Unplug all the electrical appliances.</i>

29:05.965 --> 29:08.737
<i>If you have a truck or car...</i>

31:09.952 --> 31:11.979
Let me tell you right now, boy and girl.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.440
That this beautiful
American truth way Bible...

31:14.540 --> 31:16.900
with fine git edge an full page
color pictures can be yours for...

31:17.000 --> 31:20.733
9,95. Wait a minute before you say
anything, let me tell you something.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.031
This Bible has everything in it.

31:23.131 --> 31:27.445
From the creation of this beautiful
world of ours to the fall of mankind.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.497
Look, Duncan, just,
hang on a little longer, alright?

31:30.597 --> 31:33.041
I gotta find my boy. Christ!
What's goin' on out there?

31:33.141 --> 31:35.697
Look, man. You can't even see!

31:36.142 --> 31:37.419
I can see just fine.

31:37.519 --> 31:41.003
I don't wanna pop you one, Joe.
You keep yapping' at me, I'm goin'!

31:42.232 --> 31:45.343
Duncan? Duncan!

31:45.443 --> 31:46.553
What's he doin'?

31:46.653 --> 31:49.092
- You really goin' after Deke, man?
- Yeah.

31:49.405 --> 31:51.266
Look, how many fingers do you see?

31:51.366 --> 31:53.141
Eight, twelve?

31:53.743 --> 31:56.847
Alright, so I got a little double vision.
But it's clearin' up, Bill.

31:57.664 --> 31:59.438
I gotta find my boy.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.764
I gotta!

32:02.252 --> 32:04.725
Anything could be goin' on there.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.516
Christ sakes!

32:08.130 --> 32:11.021
You leave without punchin' out...

32:11.425 --> 32:14.120
and you ain't never gonna
have to punch in again, Bubba.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.899
Good!

32:16.806 --> 32:18.874
You leave me along, fat fuck!

32:18.974 --> 32:20.917
No, leave him alone!

32:22.602 --> 32:24.201
Or what?

32:24.813 --> 32:27.585
Or I'll knock your teeth in, Bubba.

32:45.790 --> 32:48.182
Duncan, look out!

32:51.879 --> 32:53.477
Oh God!

32:59.468 --> 33:01.579
It'll give you protection
in time of danger.

33:01.679 --> 33:06.540
It'll give you health in time of
sickness and fondness leviticus.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.956
It just...

33:11.438 --> 33:13.712
Oh, sucker!

33:16.943 --> 33:19.051
Son-of-a-bitch! Out my way, bitch!

33:19.654 --> 33:21.715
Fucker!

33:22.116 --> 33:24.841
I'm gonna tear 'em up, boy!

33:32.916 --> 33:36.601
Where the hell are you goin',
drunk son-of-a-bitch?

33:37.211 --> 33:39.106
Get back inside, you idiot!

33:39.380 --> 33:41.867
God dammit, you snot bag!
Come on out!

33:41.967 --> 33:43.910
- Come on! Get outta here!
- Let me go!

33:44.010 --> 33:47.830
You wanna rock and roll with me?

33:47.930 --> 33:49.706
Bastard!

33:50.516 --> 33:53.294
Right here, you, prick!

33:53.394 --> 33:57.161
You overgrown! Scum ball! ¡By God!

34:03.695 --> 34:06.253
Get outta the way, you crappy asshole!

34:56.909 --> 35:01.687
This is Bubba Hendershot at Dixie Boy.
Anybody read me out there?

35:01.789 --> 35:04.692
Come on in, Rusty!

35:04.792 --> 35:07.904
No one. No one in the cab
of that motherfucker at all.

35:08.004 --> 35:11.072
- Horse puck!
- What we gonna do now?

35:14.802 --> 35:17.538
- I don't know.
- This is Bubba Hendershot...

35:17.638 --> 35:21.571
at the Dixie Boy! God dammit,
Rusty, come on in, boy!

35:22.057 --> 35:23.915
Spread it on the ground next to him.

35:24.768 --> 35:26.378
Hurry up, man!

35:26.478 --> 35:28.752
Jesus, he's starting to draw flies.

35:36.154 --> 35:37.639
What the hell are you doing in there?

35:37.739 --> 35:39.088
Changing.

35:39.449 --> 35:42.018
That salesman had his hands
all over me and he's dead now.

35:42.118 --> 35:45.436
I don't like the smell of him on me.
I don't like it.

35:47.622 --> 35:48.970
Jesus!

35:53.419 --> 35:56.905
For chrissake, don't just stay there.
He's dripping all over my floor.

35:57.005 --> 35:59.897
- Get him outta here!
- Come on, man. Come on.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.988
What the hell are you guys looking at?

36:09.101 --> 36:10.919
- Nothing.
- That's right. Nothing.

36:11.019 --> 36:13.329
Well then, go look at it somewhere else.

36:18.692 --> 36:20.290
Okay.

37:48.566 --> 37:52.749
Goddamn things got no right to
be running through this depot.

38:32.023 --> 38:33.918
Where are they going, Curtis?

38:34.025 --> 38:35.588
I don't know.

38:36.317 --> 38:40.086
Greensboro, maybe. Maybe Charlotte.

38:42.198 --> 38:43.878
Why?

38:44.409 --> 38:45.971
Don't know.

38:49.872 --> 38:51.980
Try the radio again.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.542
I think I've just loaded my pants.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.911
Curt.

39:17.731 --> 39:21.417
Curtis, it's coming after us!

39:40.543 --> 39:43.315
My God, Curtis. It's gonna bump us!

39:53.681 --> 39:56.703
Mom, please talk to me!

40:21.457 --> 40:22.852
Hang on!

40:34.258 --> 40:38.028
Curtis, I knew I never
should let you drive again.

40:42.726 --> 40:46.825
Curtis, make him stop following us!

41:08.499 --> 41:11.982
- Curtis, what is going on?
- I don't know!

41:17.174 --> 41:20.575
But I know, we call the police
from the truck stop up there.

41:57.835 --> 42:00.108
My God!

42:02.130 --> 42:06.659
When we get to that truck stop
everything will be all right. Oh, yes.

42:09.304 --> 42:11.614
What are you doing?

42:13.016 --> 42:14.696
Do you see that gap?

42:15.727 --> 42:18.589
The next time it comes around
I'm gonna shoot right through it.

42:18.689 --> 42:22.299
No, you don't!
They'll gang up and squash us!

42:22.399 --> 42:23.801
I can do it!

42:23.901 --> 42:27.004
All so we can be inside where they are?

42:27.403 --> 42:29.796
What do you think is gonna
happen to us if we stay out here?

42:33.201 --> 42:35.095
I'm scared.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.970
Me, too.

42:41.376 --> 42:44.349
Billy! Come here
and look at these fools.

42:46.631 --> 42:49.566
- Now what?
- They're dead.

42:50.174 --> 42:52.118
- Yeah, maybe not.
- Don't go out there, man.

42:52.218 --> 42:54.657
- Don't, Joe!
- Eat this.

42:55.554 --> 42:57.235
Hang on tight!

43:20.118 --> 43:23.938
Curtis, I'm upside down. I'm stuck.

43:24.038 --> 43:26.900
Where are you going?
Will you get me out of here?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.807
I'm caught in this goddamn seatbelt.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.479
I told you not to use the seat belts.
I told you a thousand time.

43:34.216 --> 43:36.784
I said, watch out!
Curtis, will you help me?

43:36.884 --> 43:40.788
Watch that thing, will you?
That thing looks sharp!

43:40.888 --> 43:44.582
He's not my Curtis.
Where is my Curtis? Shit!

43:44.682 --> 43:48.502
Goddamn, asshole!
Curtis, will you help me?

43:48.602 --> 43:50.165
Help me!

43:56.360 --> 44:00.757
Alright, Bubba!
Stick this one up your own cheek!

44:03.826 --> 44:08.354
Fuckin' truck's gotta be dee-po'ed.
That one's deep po'ed for sure.

44:08.747 --> 44:11.555
Reload me, Joey.
Come on, reload me, boy.

44:18.922 --> 44:21.742
And I want that shit, Bubba!

44:21.842 --> 44:24.448
Come on! Run!

44:29.932 --> 44:32.085
Honey, you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

44:32.185 --> 44:33.127
Where'd you get all that stuff?

44:33.227 --> 44:35.667
- We got a bunch of that stuff down.
- Shut up, Joey.

44:37.816 --> 44:40.503
Found it in my
Christmas stocking, Bubba.

44:42.234 --> 44:45.207
Get inside. Come on, let's get inside.

45:42.956 --> 45:44.602
How are the love birds?

45:45.834 --> 45:48.026
Heart rates are
slowin' down a bit, I think.

45:48.588 --> 45:49.936
That's good.

45:50.423 --> 45:52.103
Mother's helper?

45:55.011 --> 45:58.328
A girl hitchin' her way down
to Florida needs some protection.

45:59.307 --> 46:03.075
- That's what you're doing?
- Yeah.

46:04.684 --> 46:09.296
I was doing it before the machines
went into maximum overdrive.

46:18.406 --> 46:19.968
I'm scared.

46:30.460 --> 46:32.649
If I put my arm around you...

46:33.920 --> 46:35.731
would you stick me with that thing?

46:38.257 --> 46:40.815
You don't stick a person
with a strap razor.

46:41.135 --> 46:42.733
It's more like...

46:45.430 --> 46:47.029
And I wouldn't...

46:58.611 --> 47:00.123
Okay?

47:06.700 --> 47:08.594
Holy cow!

47:54.537 --> 47:57.010
- Joey?
- Yeah?

47:58.747 --> 48:00.310
Get up here.

48:02.459 --> 48:03.891
It's over, man.

48:05.128 --> 48:08.102
Does he really got a lotta
fire power down in the cellar?

48:09.299 --> 48:11.822
You heard him tell me
to shut up, didn't you?

48:12.552 --> 48:14.411
Come on, Joey, this is serious.

48:16.306 --> 48:17.701
He's got a lot.

48:18.767 --> 48:20.198
Grenades?

48:20.393 --> 48:21.789
Well.

48:22.103 --> 48:25.206
What else?
Flame throwers, rifles, what?

48:27.357 --> 48:29.915
You're gonna get us in an
awful lot of trouble, man.

48:31.569 --> 48:35.587
In case you didn't realize it, boy,
we're already in trouble.

48:38.660 --> 48:40.388
Talk to me, Joey.

48:42.580 --> 48:45.471
Everything. He's got everything.

48:46.084 --> 48:47.977
Now, go and leave me alone, Billy!

48:51.088 --> 48:52.731
Holy shit!

48:54.840 --> 48:56.438
You think he stole all this?

48:56.967 --> 49:00.368
No, I think he bought it,
cheap like a guy like him does.

49:01.138 --> 49:02.735
Buys things cheap?

49:02.848 --> 49:06.249
Buy cheap and sell dear.
It's the American way.

49:09.521 --> 49:13.919
Jesus Christ!
This is cute, isn't it?

49:14.818 --> 49:17.424
You find any money on him, Bubba?

49:20.530 --> 49:25.093
I don't now what to make of this, boy.
You're bright, I know you are.

49:26.202 --> 49:28.354
You keep on bein' obtuse.

49:28.454 --> 49:31.309
We don't wanna steal anything.
We just wanna get outta here alive.

49:31.790 --> 49:34.978
You messin' again, Bubba,
who ain't oughta be messin'.

49:36.503 --> 49:38.948
Sometimes even college boys
don't learn their lesson...

49:39.048 --> 49:41.571
until they had their chops
busted a few times, do they?

49:41.676 --> 49:44.781
You know what's goin' on
outside or are you blind?

49:45.304 --> 49:49.071
You tell the little road twit
about your illustrious career?

49:49.473 --> 49:53.669
He's a blood-thirsty criminal, alright.
Regular John Dillinger.

49:53.769 --> 49:55.367
Goddamn you!

49:55.854 --> 49:59.257
Couple o' charlotte cops caught him
in this little bitty grocery store.

49:59.357 --> 50:03.838
With a sack o' money in his hand,
thumb up his ass, big grin on his face.

50:03.945 --> 50:06.348
You wanna get outta here, boy.
One call, I get you outta here!

50:06.448 --> 50:09.765
Oh yeah? Who you gonna call?
The North Carolina state police?

50:10.160 --> 50:12.771
Now listen. I won't play any goddamn
games with you, Hendershot.

50:12.871 --> 50:14.730
I just wanna get the hell outta here.

50:14.957 --> 50:19.103
- I'm warnin' you, boy.
- No, man, I'm warnin' you!

50:25.047 --> 50:29.232
This thin's over,
your ass is grass, boy.

50:30.679 --> 50:32.407
Do you hear me?

50:34.432 --> 50:35.828
Joey!

50:36.809 --> 50:41.464
Goddamn you, Joey!
I told you to keep an eye on the keys!

50:41.564 --> 50:43.292
I owed a guy some money.

50:45.691 --> 50:48.000
I was about twenty at the time.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.847
Not real bright about most things.

50:51.947 --> 50:54.257
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

50:57.995 --> 51:00.103
What gets to me is his stupidity.

51:04.877 --> 51:08.443
Cops put that spotlight on me
and I just froze like a rabbit.

51:14.050 --> 51:15.648
It's all right.

52:17.692 --> 52:20.380
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What's that?

52:21.570 --> 52:23.596
You sure make love like a hero.

52:45.133 --> 52:49.448
Look at that light.

52:50.430 --> 52:52.029
Do you know what I think?

52:52.140 --> 52:54.747
- What?
- I think it's the comet.

52:56.645 --> 52:59.215
We've been in its tail
for almost twelve hours.

52:59.315 --> 53:02.134
And if it is that comet that's making
everything go crazy...

53:02.234 --> 53:05.004
then all we gotta do is
stay alive for the next seven days.

53:06.903 --> 53:08.713
No problem.

53:25.296 --> 53:26.776
I got an idea.

53:39.517 --> 53:40.948
Can you sail?

53:41.769 --> 53:44.171
A little. Hobie cats
and things like that.

53:44.271 --> 53:46.664
Good deal. I used to crew big ones.

53:48.150 --> 53:49.830
Sailboats, no motors.

53:51.070 --> 53:52.845
No motors?

53:54.365 --> 53:55.558
Where would we go?

53:55.658 --> 53:58.269
I'm thinkin' about this
place called Haven.

53:58.369 --> 54:01.768
It's an island about
six miles off the coast.

54:02.036 --> 54:06.730
And there aren't any motor vehicles
allowed on the place. None whatsoever.

54:06.917 --> 54:08.515
None?

54:10.128 --> 54:11.808
You know...

54:12.214 --> 54:15.982
you are not only a hero...

54:16.843 --> 54:18.867
you are a genius.

54:51.166 --> 54:53.643
The whole goddamn world's goin' to hell.

54:54.586 --> 54:57.946
They can't! We made them!

54:58.046 --> 55:01.115
Look, honey. You've gonna hurt yourself.
Come on, sweet thing.

55:01.215 --> 55:04.703
- Don't you 'sweet thing' me!
- Now, Wanda June, baby, just let...

55:04.803 --> 55:08.821
They can't! We made them!

55:11.934 --> 55:18.049
You can't! We made you! Do you hear?

55:18.149 --> 55:23.924
Where's your sense of loyalty?
You things!

55:24.946 --> 55:30.933
We made you! We made you!

55:31.619 --> 55:36.106
Made you! We made you!

55:36.206 --> 55:38.108
- Wanda!
- We made them!

55:38.208 --> 55:40.186
- Wanda!
- We made them!

55:53.681 --> 55:57.366
Not the dark. Please God, don't...

56:00.812 --> 56:05.755
I'm scared.
Please don't let us be in the dark!

56:15.076 --> 56:18.049
Man, stop with them damn spoons.

56:18.455 --> 56:20.438
Safer than the juke box.

56:20.538 --> 56:22.348
I like spoons.

56:25.042 --> 56:27.861
Man, this is one piece of shit.

56:27.961 --> 56:29.939
Shit!

56:31.048 --> 56:33.951
Damn trucks ain't never
gonna let us outta here.

56:34.051 --> 56:35.614
I believe it.

56:48.230 --> 56:51.417
- Place your bets.
- I don't usually play for peanuts.

56:52.025 --> 56:53.588
Come on.

56:55.403 --> 56:58.376
- I gotta eat.
- Deal, woman.

57:01.577 --> 57:03.090
Hit me.

57:06.873 --> 57:08.388
There's lot less of them.

57:10.460 --> 57:11.891
Yeah.

57:13.379 --> 57:15.357
Looks like they're running dry.

57:15.922 --> 57:17.780
Think they're pushin' them in back.

57:20.551 --> 57:22.743
Maybe tomorrow it'll be our world again.

57:24.055 --> 57:25.451
I don't know.

57:26.849 --> 57:28.447
Was it ever?

57:28.976 --> 57:31.452
I hate those fuckin' trucks.

57:31.729 --> 57:34.454
I never did like trucks anyway.

57:35.441 --> 57:37.251
Holy shit!

57:38.068 --> 57:39.548
What was that?

57:41.113 --> 57:44.348
God, that's that Bibles'
salesman I rode in with.

57:44.448 --> 57:46.223
There's some guy out there?

57:46.950 --> 57:51.217
Sweet Jesus, help me!

57:55.042 --> 57:57.730
Help me!

58:04.092 --> 58:06.203
- Let's go get him!
- No, you don't!

58:06.303 --> 58:09.414
You let some of those other big
strong men go out and get him.

58:09.514 --> 58:12.072
I didn't sign on here to be no hero.

58:12.891 --> 58:14.072
Yeah!

58:14.601 --> 58:17.076
Wait a second! Wait a second! Wait up!

58:17.978 --> 58:21.582
Just like the old joke,
you can't get there from here.

58:21.774 --> 58:24.380
We gonna stand around
and listen to him do that?

58:25.069 --> 58:27.093
Y'know, I think there
might be a way to get to him.

59:24.999 --> 59:27.943
Now, the shower drain runs into
the ditch where the guy is.

59:28.043 --> 59:29.487
Will we fit?

59:29.587 --> 59:31.906
- One way to find out.
- You boys are crazy.

59:32.006 --> 59:36.484
Curt? Curtis! Curtis!

59:38.802 --> 59:40.151
What are you doin'?

59:40.470 --> 59:42.998
- I'll be right back.
- You ain't goin'!

59:43.098 --> 59:44.708
There's a man layin'
hurt out there, honey.

59:44.808 --> 59:48.003
There's gonna be a man hurt layin' here
if you don't quit this foolishness.

59:48.103 --> 59:50.130
If it was your man out there,
you'd want someone to go, wouldn't you?

59:50.230 --> 59:52.883
Well, it ain't. You're not goin'.

59:52.983 --> 59:54.332
I'm goin'!

59:55.151 --> 59:58.256
Don't make me a widow
on my wedding day, Curtis.

59:58.446 --> 59:59.842
Okay.

01:00:02.158 --> 01:00:04.845
Just scoot right across.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:07.641
- Pick up your feet and try not to...
- I can handle it.

01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:12.815
You boys are just as crazy as a couple
of rats in a plugged-up shithouse!

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:17.819
You are without a doubt one of the
biggest fuck heads I ever met.

01:00:18.714 --> 01:00:20.033
- Wish me luck.
- Yeah.

01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:22.323
You ready? Let's do it.

01:00:55.165 --> 01:00:57.558
Good thing that one was outta gas.

01:00:57.668 --> 01:00:59.348
What makes you so sure that it was?

01:01:01.378 --> 01:01:03.984
I don't think we need to
worry about that right now.

01:01:35.243 --> 01:01:37.017
Okay.

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:47.024
Oh man, are you ready? One, two, three.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:57.904
Bombs away!

01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:09.458
- Think it'll hold?
- Fucked if I know.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:32.820
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.025
- Okay. You wanna grab that bag?
- Thanks.

01:02:37.842 --> 01:02:41.445
Oh, Jesus. This sucker weighs a...

01:02:42.847 --> 01:02:44.906
Oh, boy!

01:02:50.812 --> 01:02:52.621
Great smell, huh?

01:02:54.105 --> 01:02:55.916
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:02.197 --> 01:03:04.505
I wonder how many
people have peed in this.

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:12.773
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.972
How's it taste?

01:03:28.053 --> 01:03:30.778
- Shit! I'm sending' you a friend.
- Shit!

01:03:32.057 --> 01:03:34.082
Get outta here!

01:04:17.807 --> 01:04:19.286
Mister?

01:04:50.629 --> 01:04:54.113
- Help me!
- How?

01:04:54.382 --> 01:04:59.037
- Pull me! Pull me!
- I can't! You're too heavy!

01:04:59.137 --> 01:05:01.162
Get me out of this ditch...

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:05.448
or by Jesus I'll kill you!

01:05:12.314 --> 01:05:16.051
Shit! What a great time! I wish I could
do that every day. What a blast!

01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:18.425
¡Bill! Bill!

01:05:19.405 --> 01:05:22.295
- Bill, help me!
- Jesus! That's Deke!

01:05:23.826 --> 01:05:25.269
Help me!

01:05:25.369 --> 01:05:27.595
- Come on!
- Please, help me!

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:34.361
Stop pulling me.

01:05:34.461 --> 01:05:36.613
- He's dead!
- No he isn't!

01:05:36.713 --> 01:05:38.115
¡He's dead!

01:05:38.215 --> 01:05:40.406
He's dead! He's dead!

01:05:42.175 --> 01:05:44.568
Let's go. Come on, dammit!

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:49.416
Bill, you okay, bud?

01:05:49.516 --> 01:05:52.157
Yeah, I'm okay.
Will you your ass, for chrissake?

01:06:00.151 --> 01:06:01.547
Okay.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.056
- Let's go.
- Bill?

01:06:13.454 --> 01:06:17.519
Bill, is my dad okay?

01:06:21.045 --> 01:06:22.440
Come on.

01:06:26.341 --> 01:06:27.691
Let's go partner.

01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:34.082
I think that truck got 'em.
That's what I think.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:36.166
I think they're dead.

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:39.199
No, they're all right.

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:43.590
- Then, where are they?
- There they are! They just came up!

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:47.007
That ain't no salesman.
That's Duncan's kid.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.179
Go, go!

01:07:04.584 --> 01:07:07.142
- Way to go, Billy!
- Hello, boy.

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:13.075
You ain't gonna be satisfied until you
get 'em right in here with us.

01:07:13.175 --> 01:07:14.738
Cigar, Joey.

01:07:17.346 --> 01:07:19.123
Mr. Hendershot, did you
see he nailed that big one?

01:07:19.223 --> 01:07:21.208
- Bill, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:21.308 --> 01:07:23.251
How'd you find the kid?

01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:27.412
Bill, where's my dad?

01:07:28.732 --> 01:07:32.713
Duncan got scrubbed by
on of them big boys out there.

01:07:33.318 --> 01:07:37.004
- Touch break, kid.
- You unbelievable shithead!

01:07:44.496 --> 01:07:45.927
Is it true?

01:07:48.792 --> 01:07:50.306
Is it true?

01:07:53.296 --> 01:07:54.692
Yeah, it's true.

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.276
No!

01:08:03.596 --> 01:08:07.863
No, no. Hang on, now.

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:11.451
- Hang on, Deke.
- Mr. Hendershot.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:18.260
Just a little lesson
from the road twitch.

01:08:20.654 --> 01:08:22.252
Hold on, Deke.

01:09:26.589 --> 01:09:27.984
Bill?

01:09:28.256 --> 01:09:29.652
Bill!

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.868
Bill, wake up!
There's something out there.

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:36.240
There's something out there.
You gotta see this.

01:09:36.765 --> 01:09:38.540
Come on! Wake up!

01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:59.631
It's right up here.

01:10:16.427 --> 01:10:19.614
What the fuck is goin' on here?

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:28.996
Now what?

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.339
Holy God!

01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:16.833
Alright!

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.832
Alright, God dammit!

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:42.690
You want a war?

01:11:43.173 --> 01:11:44.406
You got one.

01:11:44.506 --> 01:11:46.992
- Man, I wouldn't do that.
- Shut up, Bubba.

01:11:47.092 --> 01:11:49.567
Shit! Get down!

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.453
How do you like that, chickenshit?

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:31.107
Jesus Christ!

01:12:39.016 --> 01:12:41.204
It stopped, man.

01:13:01.869 --> 01:13:04.060
You sons-of-bitches!

01:13:30.563 --> 01:13:33.423
- Wanda, no!
- You sons-of-bitches!

01:13:33.523 --> 01:13:38.343
- Don't go.
- We made you!

01:13:38.443 --> 01:13:42.931
Don't you understand?
You can't do this!

01:13:43.031 --> 01:13:45.139
We made you!

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.533
¡Wanda, Wanda!
That's Wanda June out there, dammit!

01:14:02.633 --> 01:14:04.196
Deke!

01:14:04.302 --> 01:14:06.702
Deke, goddammit, you're gonna
get killed. Stay down.

01:14:06.802 --> 01:14:10.072
It's right there.
If it wants to waste us, it will.

01:14:28.782 --> 01:14:30.676
Now what is it doing?

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.639
It's morse.

01:14:33.744 --> 01:14:35.270
Bullshit!

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:39.435
No, really. I should know.
I got a merit badge in it this spring.

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:41.852
Well, what's it sayin', kid?

01:14:45.129 --> 01:14:47.237
Give me a pen.
I can't keep up with it.

01:15:07.025 --> 01:15:09.426
Incredible, they want us to feed them.

01:15:09.526 --> 01:15:10.803
Feed 'em?

01:15:10.903 --> 01:15:14.055
Fuck 'em. Let 'em starve!
Half of them's outta gas already.

01:15:14.323 --> 01:15:16.301
Let 'em starve, it won't take long.

01:15:22.081 --> 01:15:25.814
We can't fill 'em anyway.
We ain't got no power.

01:15:28.543 --> 01:15:29.892
Shit!

01:15:33.589 --> 01:15:36.481
I'll be damned.
I'm gonna turn on the pumps.

01:15:36.968 --> 01:15:40.073
Hope none of them left home without
their American Express cards.

01:15:42.974 --> 01:15:45.166
Bill, wait!

01:15:49.564 --> 01:15:50.960
Wait!

01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:55.546
It's not a good idea. It's like Neville
Chamberlain giving in to the Nazis.

01:15:56.443 --> 01:15:58.124
Come here.

01:15:59.029 --> 01:16:00.425
Okay.

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.558
- Now, you see that one, right?
- Yes I do.

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:04.435
Okay. Now look,
here's the way I figure it.

01:16:04.535 --> 01:16:06.353
The big guys,
they're heavy weights, okay?

01:16:06.453 --> 01:16:09.524
They crash in here, they won't break
the floor and open the cellar.

01:16:09.624 --> 01:16:11.734
But that one, that bastard ain't
no reason why he couldn't...

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:15.235
call in a truck full of napalm
and hose this place down.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.697
Just take care of yourself, okay?

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.614
What are they gonna do?
Run me down?

01:16:22.094 --> 01:16:24.817
Shit, that'd be like a junkie tryin' to
run down his connection.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.601
Alright, you bastard!

01:17:44.586 --> 01:17:46.978
Tell all your friends
the main line's open.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.067
Got the best shit on the
east coast, practically uncut.

01:17:55.177 --> 01:17:56.988
You got that, fuck face?

01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:28.147
This could be a very long day.

01:18:55.692 --> 01:18:57.206
Served, guy.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:40.838
Shut up, already!
You ain't don' so bad here! Here!

01:19:41.858 --> 01:19:43.836
There! Suck on that!

01:19:49.032 --> 01:19:51.009
I'll take over.

01:19:53.828 --> 01:19:55.307
Thanks.

01:19:57.831 --> 01:19:59.892
I hope they choke on it.

01:21:10.522 --> 01:21:12.120
Sorry, guys.

01:21:13.525 --> 01:21:16.298
It was fun while it lasted,
but we're all out.

01:21:38.798 --> 01:21:40.194
What?

01:21:40.383 --> 01:21:41.779
What do you want?

01:21:53.854 --> 01:21:55.047
What?

01:21:55.147 --> 01:21:57.754
- What's it doin'?
- I don't know.

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:09.948
Billy, come on, I'll take over here.

01:23:10.173 --> 01:23:11.569
He's all done.

01:23:11.967 --> 01:23:13.742
They don't understand.

01:23:14.845 --> 01:23:16.241
What's that, Billy?

01:23:16.596 --> 01:23:20.829
How it is to get tired.
How a man gets tired.

01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:25.378
Why should they? Come on.

01:23:25.478 --> 01:23:30.836
- If you need any help, call me.
- I will. Come on, man.

01:23:34.195 --> 01:23:36.303
We've been puttin' stuff
down in the cellar.

01:23:36.823 --> 01:23:38.641
Now the kid said there's a
big sewer pipe down there.

01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:41.019
He couldn't get in
because of the wire and shit.

01:23:41.119 --> 01:23:43.013
But we can use it to get outta here.

01:23:48.918 --> 01:23:50.598
Looks like the coffee break's over.

01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:53.111
His master's voice.

01:23:53.879 --> 01:23:57.980
- Go on in and lay down now.
- All right.

01:24:09.979 --> 01:24:11.873
It isn't the comet, you know?

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.172
- It's the broom.
- What?

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:16.248
Brooms.

01:24:21.446 --> 01:24:25.345
Imagine you're a race of aliens, right?

01:24:26.535 --> 01:24:30.138
And you're looking for
a new place to live.

01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:37.612
You're lookin' for a planet like
we look for a new place to live.

01:24:37.712 --> 01:24:39.606
A new house or something...

01:24:41.007 --> 01:24:42.735
So here's Earth.

01:24:44.427 --> 01:24:46.903
Only it's like this big old house...

01:24:48.929 --> 01:24:51.487
and it's polluted...

01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:56.085
dirty and smoky.

01:24:57.104 --> 01:25:01.086
Grease on the walls,
soot in the chimney...

01:25:03.777 --> 01:25:09.255
And they send their
interstellar cleaners...

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.094
sending their broom.

01:25:17.164 --> 01:25:19.188
Sweep us all up.

01:25:21.585 --> 01:25:23.562
That's what it is, a broom.

01:25:24.171 --> 01:25:27.856
They use the machines
to sweep us right up.

01:25:44.024 --> 01:25:45.963
Mister!

01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.586
Mister!

01:25:51.028 --> 01:25:52.626
Come over here.

01:26:02.206 --> 01:26:03.886
How are you doing?

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.180
Tired and scared.

01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:08.605
I've got this plan.

01:26:12.466 --> 01:26:14.145
Come on with this thing already.

01:26:15.009 --> 01:26:16.403
Bitch!

01:26:19.804 --> 01:26:22.582
We never gonna get out here.
Really.

01:26:22.682 --> 01:26:24.281
Cool, champ!

01:26:25.143 --> 01:26:28.959
Little human business to take care of,
some you wouldn't understand.

01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:35.174
When I said run, you run, okay?

01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:38.181
- What you gonna do?
- Don't worry, just run, okay?

01:26:38.281 --> 01:26:39.676
What you gonna do?

01:26:44.159 --> 01:26:45.639
Run!

01:26:56.047 --> 01:26:59.233
I ain't never seen a hero
with his ass in the air like that.

01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:06.035
Hi, baby.

01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:21.469
I bet there's spiders down there.

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:24.807
I hate anything with
more than four legs.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:25.932
I can't do this!

01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:29.386
I'm just gonna keep...
Oh, don't drop me now!

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:32.102
I just gotta see Curtis if you drop me.

01:27:43.381 --> 01:27:46.075
- What, Curtis?
- Just stay down.

01:27:46.175 --> 01:27:48.567
I wish we could get outta here!

01:27:57.561 --> 01:27:59.420
Holy shit!

01:28:01.941 --> 01:28:04.831
Stay down, Bubba. Holy shit!

01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:09.772
Jesus is coming and he is pissed.

01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:31.121
- Can we get outta here?
- Yeah, it's time to get outta here.

01:29:31.437 --> 01:29:33.118
Let's go, gang! Let's go.

01:29:34.315 --> 01:29:35.830
Let's go.

01:30:08.472 --> 01:30:09.986
¡My God!

01:30:10.683 --> 01:30:13.289
That son-of-a-bitch is goin' up again.

01:30:22.777 --> 01:30:24.761
- God almighty!
- Move it!

01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:26.346
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go!

01:30:26.446 --> 01:30:28.921
Come on, go, go!

01:31:23.831 --> 01:31:26.354
