WEBVTT

00:01.311 --> 00:03.237
Okay, no, you look young in photos.

00:03.330 --> 00:05.142
I swear I'm always
saying that about you.

00:05.266 --> 00:08.200
Oh, my God, have we already
been talking two hours?

00:08.234 --> 00:10.602
Hey, you know
where we've never made love?

00:10.920 --> 00:12.004
Oh!

00:12.038 --> 00:14.840
Sorry, it's your mom,
and she says try the laundry room.

00:14.874 --> 00:16.675
Okay. All right. Bye, Mom.

00:16.709 --> 00:18.277
Weird talk. Love you.

00:18.464 --> 00:20.846
Aw, thank you so much, Irene.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.349
Oh, I can't wait to tell David.
Okay, all right, talk soon.

00:24.384 --> 00:26.518
<i>You know those crazy people
who love their in-laws?</i>

00:26.552 --> 00:27.719
<i>That's me.</i>

00:27.754 --> 00:29.421
- Honey, guess what.
- Mm?

00:29.455 --> 00:31.290
Your parents are gonna come
into town for Hanukkah.

00:31.889 --> 00:33.759
Yeah, they want
to throw a little gathering...

00:33.793 --> 00:35.083
You know, family a few friends.

00:35.095 --> 00:36.862
They're gonna come here? That's great.

00:36.896 --> 00:38.297
Wait, they're coming here?
That's not great.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.698
We are not ready for that.

00:39.732 --> 00:42.434
We go there, we amp up the Judaism
so they think we're more observant.

00:42.468 --> 00:43.802
But if they're coming here...

00:43.836 --> 00:46.638
<i>David's right... my mother-in-law
is super into her culture.</i>

00:46.673 --> 00:48.363
<i>So we lean into it for her benefit.</i>

00:48.398 --> 00:49.329
Yep, you're right.

00:49.364 --> 00:50.309
- We've got work to do.
- We do.

00:50.343 --> 00:51.710
Okay, let's start with the kids.

00:51.744 --> 00:53.478
- They're great liars.
- Good point. Okay.

00:53.513 --> 00:54.946
Hey, guys. Guys, guys, guys.

00:54.981 --> 00:56.448
Listen up. Okay.

00:56.482 --> 00:57.549
- Yeah.
- Hey.

00:58.097 --> 00:58.817
No.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.619
Lily, you remember the prayer we say

01:00.653 --> 01:03.488
before Shabbat dinner when we go
to Nana and Pop Pop's house, right?

01:03.523 --> 01:05.290
Do I remember the what
before the what now?

01:05.325 --> 01:06.591
Shabbat, dummy.

01:06.626 --> 01:09.561
Shabbat's the little beanie hat
that won't stay on, you schmuck.

01:09.595 --> 01:12.464
You're a schmuck, schmuck.

01:12.498 --> 01:14.733
All right, well, at least
they know one word of Hebrew.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.401
- That's not Hebrew.
- Okay.

01:19.439 --> 01:21.073
_

01:21.107 --> 01:24.743
<i>All right. We are pulling out
all the stops to convince my in-laws</i>

01:24.777 --> 01:28.980
<i>their grandkids are growing up
in a culturally rich Jewish-ish home.</i>

01:29.015 --> 01:30.349
All right, you guys, repeat after me.

01:32.710 --> 01:35.320
- Good.
- Barack la-blah gla blah la la?

01:35.355 --> 01:36.755
Not as good.

01:36.789 --> 01:38.590
Wow, their Hebrew's almost
as bad as their Hindi.

01:38.624 --> 01:39.791
We are asleep at the cultural wheel.

01:39.826 --> 01:41.426
We got to get better at this stuff.

01:41.461 --> 01:43.362
Okay, honey, I would love to do better,

01:43.396 --> 01:44.830
but who's got the time?

01:44.864 --> 01:46.865
I mean, we're barely
getting through the basics.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.533
Have you seen how long
the baby's nails are?

01:48.568 --> 01:51.303
Oh, yeah, I used them
to open mail the other day.

01:51.337 --> 01:53.772
Ooh! I am gonna put this bad boy up.

01:53.806 --> 01:55.774
I'm gonna get my tools.
No, I'm gonna glue it.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.776
Hey, you guys,
come help me glue the mezuzah.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.611
- Sure.
- All right.

01:59.645 --> 02:00.979
<i>Transforming our home is easy.</i>

02:01.013 --> 02:02.814
<i>The hard part is my mom.</i>

02:02.849 --> 02:04.716
<i>She doesn't even know
my in-laws are coming.</i>

02:04.751 --> 02:06.651
<i>And if she knew we put this much effort</i>

02:06.686 --> 02:09.354
<i>into David's parents' culture,
she might call us out.</i>

02:09.389 --> 02:11.523
What's with the candelabra, Liberace?

02:11.557 --> 02:13.625
How do you walk so softly?

02:13.659 --> 02:15.394
I've got to take your key back.

02:15.428 --> 02:17.963
So now you care about holidays.

02:17.997 --> 02:19.364
What about Diwali?

02:19.399 --> 02:20.966
We celebrated Diwali.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.401
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:22.435 --> 02:24.469
You lit one diya, ordered takeout,

02:24.504 --> 02:25.804
and half-assed a prayer.

02:25.838 --> 02:28.673
You're always too busy
for our traditions.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.543
Suddenly you have plenty
of time for Hanukkah?

02:31.577 --> 02:32.978
<i>God, she's sharp.</i>

02:33.012 --> 02:34.646
<i>I got to flush her ginkgo biloba.</i>

02:34.680 --> 02:35.814
<i>Think, Emet, think.</i>

02:35.848 --> 02:37.482
What? Hanukkah?

02:37.517 --> 02:39.484
Oh, is that what this is for?
Oh, no, no, no.

02:39.519 --> 02:41.653
See, I thought this was
just a fancy candleholder,

02:41.687 --> 02:43.388
and you know me,
I can't resist a good sale.

02:43.423 --> 02:47.092
Hmm. Everybody tells me I
have a gambling problem.

02:47.126 --> 02:48.827
But you're the one with the problem.

02:48.861 --> 02:51.997
You are a shopaholic addict.

02:52.031 --> 02:53.165
Truth.

02:54.801 --> 02:56.568
<i>Okay, she can keep her gingko,</i>

02:56.602 --> 02:58.170
<i>'cause that was pretty easy.</i>

03:00.540 --> 03:02.374
Here you go, guys. Take that.

03:02.408 --> 03:03.442
- Free bacon?
- Yeah.

03:03.476 --> 03:04.509
Hell, yeah.

03:04.544 --> 03:05.944
Yeah. Did a pork sweep.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.546
My in-laws are coming,
so I'm Jewish this week.

03:07.580 --> 03:08.914
I don't think they even mind bacon,

03:08.948 --> 03:10.849
but why take the chance?
God, I'm stressed.

03:10.883 --> 03:12.184
Yeah, 'cause you're lying.

03:12.218 --> 03:13.852
No. 'Cause I could get caught lying...

03:13.886 --> 03:15.120
by my mom.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.521
Living a double life is tricky.

03:16.556 --> 03:17.956
And I should know.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.858
I'm pretending to be an
American at the moment

03:19.892 --> 03:23.061
to try and woo the new girl, Amelia.

03:23.095 --> 03:25.530
Oh, man, I would marry her tomorrow.

03:25.565 --> 03:26.865
I'd marry her brains out.

03:26.899 --> 03:27.899
- Chewey?
- Yeah?

03:27.934 --> 03:29.534
Girls love English accents.

03:29.569 --> 03:30.869
Yeah, but she's English.

03:30.903 --> 03:32.571
And you know the old saying.

03:32.605 --> 03:34.539
You can't impress a vicar
with a Bible verse.

03:34.574 --> 03:36.875
- That's not a saying in any country.
- Nope. Nowhere.

03:36.909 --> 03:38.944
Anyway, she likes American blokes.

03:38.978 --> 03:40.979
So, as long as I'm not outed,
I should be fine.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.547
Plus, I've got Griff and Norman here.

03:42.582 --> 03:44.082
- They've got my back.
- Oh, yeah.

03:44.116 --> 03:46.218
No, I'm actually very
uncomfortable with this.

03:46.252 --> 03:47.786
So see you later!

03:47.820 --> 03:50.455
All right, here she comes.

03:51.958 --> 03:53.892
Well, howdy, Amelia.

03:53.926 --> 03:56.461
All right, all right, all right.

03:56.496 --> 03:58.430
Hey, sweet McConaughey, bro.

03:58.464 --> 04:00.599
<i>Living a double life
seemed like a lot of work,</i>

04:00.633 --> 04:03.168
<i>so I decided to just get
my mom out of the picture.</i>

04:03.202 --> 04:04.436
What are you doing?

04:04.470 --> 04:05.804
We are watching "That is Them."

04:05.838 --> 04:07.472
No, I know. Guys, listen.

04:07.507 --> 04:10.008
I won a raffle last night at GamePunch

04:10.042 --> 04:12.611
for a three-night vacation,
but I can't go.

04:12.645 --> 04:13.979
Kids, work, you know how it is.

04:14.013 --> 04:15.914
I thought you guys could go.

04:15.948 --> 04:18.016
I don't have the energy to travel.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.951
I take care of your kids.

04:19.986 --> 04:23.154
Do you know how exhausting it is
to be a mother of three?

04:23.189 --> 04:25.590
Oh, that's right... you don't,

04:25.625 --> 04:26.625
because I do it.

04:26.659 --> 04:27.926
Okay, no problem.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.661
I'm sure I can find somebody else

04:29.695 --> 04:32.163
to go to Deuces Gone Wild Spa and Casino

04:32.198 --> 04:35.467
to see Paula Abdul perform.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.035
Oh, Sonny.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.203
Get my lucky visor.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.871
Ooh, I love Paula.

04:39.906 --> 04:42.674
But, darling,
with your sometimes uncontrollable

04:42.708 --> 04:44.533
enthusiasm for games of chance,

04:44.568 --> 04:45.677
can we afford it?

04:45.711 --> 04:50.949
Oh, did I not mention the room comes
with a $300 comp to the casino floor?

04:50.983 --> 04:53.485
Straight up,
now tell me all the details.

04:53.519 --> 04:54.953
<i>Who am I hurting really?</i>

04:54.987 --> 04:56.655
<i>My mom and dad get a little vacation,</i>

04:56.689 --> 04:59.124
<i>and I get my perfect Jewish holiday.</i>

04:59.158 --> 05:01.059
<i>♪ We wish you a merry Hanukkah ♪</i>

05:01.193 --> 05:03.161
<i>♪ We wish you a merry Hanukkah ♪</i>

05:03.195 --> 05:05.078
<i>Wait, that's a Christmas song.</i>

05:05.113 --> 05:06.965
<i>I better do more research.</i>

05:06.999 --> 05:08.300
<i>David's parents were on their way</i>

05:08.334 --> 05:09.968
<i>and the house looked great.</i>

05:10.002 --> 05:11.136
Uber's coming around
the corner right now.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.571
- Okay.
- You know, I'm not the natural-born

05:12.605 --> 05:13.736
liar that you are.

05:13.773 --> 05:15.426
You sure they're gonna buy this?
They're gonna buy this, right?

05:15.441 --> 05:18.726
Yes, of course.
Look, Jewish cultural signifiers, check.

05:18.778 --> 05:19.609
- Okay.
- More food

05:19.680 --> 05:20.914
- than anyone can eat, check.
- True.

05:20.948 --> 05:23.282
<i>Tiny Indian-woman-sized
weight off my shoulders,</i>

05:23.383 --> 05:24.202
<i>check.</i>

05:27.119 --> 05:28.222
Yeah.

05:29.055 --> 05:31.656
Hi!

05:31.691 --> 05:33.058
- Hi, guys!
- Hello.

05:33.092 --> 05:34.993
Oh, it's so good to see you.

05:35.027 --> 05:36.728
- Hi.
- Hey!

05:36.762 --> 05:38.830
- Good to see you.
- Hi, baby.

05:38.864 --> 05:40.532
Give me that baby.

05:40.566 --> 05:41.700
- Try and lift me.
- No.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.001
- I've lost four pounds. See if you can tell.
- No.

05:43.035 --> 05:47.005
- I can tell just by looking at you.
- Okay.

05:47.311 --> 05:48.740
Oh, my gosh.

05:48.774 --> 05:50.175
- Dad?
- Oh, here give him to me.

05:50.209 --> 05:51.710
- Dad, help me.
- Sure, sure.

05:51.744 --> 05:53.178
Emet, look at you, my God.

05:53.212 --> 05:54.846
That dress makes me
believe in red again.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.247
Oh, Irene.

05:56.282 --> 05:58.917
Oh, that comment makes me
believe in myself again.

05:58.951 --> 06:01.119
My mother asked if it
came with a time machine

06:01.153 --> 06:02.954
because I could only
pull it off 20 years ago.

06:02.989 --> 06:04.623
- She said that?
- Yeah.

06:04.657 --> 06:05.857
Maybe she has a tumor.

06:05.891 --> 06:08.345
My aunt said all kinds of things
when she had a tumor.

06:08.361 --> 06:10.195
- I'll get you the name of her doctor.
- Okay.

06:10.229 --> 06:12.097
Look at my son.

06:12.131 --> 06:15.100
I made a handsomer
David than Michelangelo.

06:15.134 --> 06:16.801
- Pop Pop!
- Hey!

06:16.836 --> 06:18.236
- Nana!
- Hey, guys!

06:18.270 --> 06:19.738
- Aw.
- Lily-billy.

06:19.772 --> 06:22.140
Oh, look at the hair on this one.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.908
You look like Joey Ramone.

06:23.943 --> 06:25.276
You know, Joey Ramone was Jewish.

06:25.311 --> 06:26.745
Not a lot of people know that.

06:26.779 --> 06:28.055
<i>Okay. Time to show off</i>

06:28.147 --> 06:30.081
<i>Lily and Louie's fake
Hebrew-school training.</i>

06:30.116 --> 06:31.816
So, Lily, Louie,

06:31.851 --> 06:35.620
how do we say hello to Nana and Pop Pop?

06:35.655 --> 06:37.055
"Shamone"!

06:37.089 --> 06:39.057
<i>"Shamone"? That's Michael Jackson.</i>

06:39.091 --> 06:41.292
<i>It's shalom, Louie. Look alive, man.</i>

06:42.733 --> 06:45.063
"Shamone" right back at ya.

06:45.097 --> 06:47.832
Now, you know what sustained our people
for thousands of years?

06:47.867 --> 06:49.901
Humor... and carbohydrates.

06:49.935 --> 06:51.236
Shall we make it to the kitchen?

06:51.270 --> 06:52.904
- Oh, yes.
- To the bagels! All right.

06:52.938 --> 06:54.773
- Bagels!
- Whew, "shamone."

07:00.075 --> 07:02.654
No, screw the director's notes.
The level-three gorgon caves

07:02.745 --> 07:04.841
will have moving tentacle vines...
I said it.

07:04.847 --> 07:06.813
Whoa! Somebody's confident today.

07:06.848 --> 07:08.081
I am.

07:08.116 --> 07:09.978
It's 'cause my in-laws
are so supportive.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.085
You know what I mean?
It's really good for my self-esteem.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.788
And how's your actual
mother taking all this?

07:14.822 --> 07:16.289
I don't know.
I shipped her ass off to a casino.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.492
Chewey, how's your lie going?

07:18.829 --> 07:21.294
Too well. She wants to go on a date.

07:21.329 --> 07:24.197
We're going to her house,
and she's cooking for me.

07:24.885 --> 07:25.765
That's great.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.664
Sounds like she might be interested
in engaging with you sexually.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.837
And that's the problem.

07:30.872 --> 07:32.873
Sure, I can keep up
this American-guy ruse

07:32.907 --> 07:34.274
in the streets, but in the sheets?

07:34.308 --> 07:36.209
Oh-ho-ho, that's a different ballgame.

07:36.244 --> 07:39.880
No, no, no, no, no,
I make love like my true British self...

07:39.914 --> 07:42.149
tenderly, thinking about the Queen.

07:44.819 --> 07:45.886
All right!

07:47.534 --> 07:50.290
- Little pre-dinner nosh.
- Wow. Yum.

07:50.324 --> 07:52.292
- Diet starts Monday.
- Or never.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.194
- Emet?
- Yeah.

07:54.228 --> 07:56.396
I was gonna wait to do this, but...

07:56.430 --> 07:59.166
I can't stop eating these latkes,
so who knows how long I'll be alive?

08:02.170 --> 08:03.403
As you know,

08:03.437 --> 08:07.340
every year I make brisket
for the first night of Hanukkah.

08:07.375 --> 08:11.511
This year I would like to pass
that tradition on to you.

08:11.546 --> 08:12.979
I want to give you

08:13.014 --> 08:16.583
our family's secret brisket recipe.

08:16.617 --> 08:18.351
Oh, Irene.

08:18.386 --> 08:20.554
Oh, I'm so touched.

08:20.588 --> 08:22.422
I'm getting very emotional.
This is huge.

08:23.079 --> 08:23.990
Emet...

08:24.025 --> 08:27.160
I think of you as the
daughter I never had.

08:27.195 --> 08:28.328
Oh.

08:28.362 --> 08:31.398
Especially since David's brother
married that witch of a...

08:31.432 --> 08:34.201
Oh, let's stay in the Hanukkah spirit,
Irene.

08:34.235 --> 08:36.102
You're right.

08:36.136 --> 08:38.938
The light filters through me.

08:38.972 --> 08:40.874
But she was deliberately cruel.

08:40.908 --> 08:42.275
- I agree.
- Yeah.

08:42.309 --> 08:44.010
The worst.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.111
Did you hear that?

08:45.146 --> 08:46.913
She thinks of me as a daughter.

08:46.948 --> 08:48.415
I know, it's like
we're brother and sister.

08:48.449 --> 08:49.849
Oh, I regret saying that.

08:49.884 --> 08:50.710
Ew.

08:51.319 --> 08:53.286
That's weird...
I'm getting a credit card alert

08:53.321 --> 08:56.556
- from a Deuces Gone Wild Casino.
- Okay.

08:56.591 --> 08:59.259
<i>Ugh, now my mom's charging
her gambling to the room.</i>

08:59.293 --> 09:00.860
<i>Man, she has a problem.</i>

09:00.895 --> 09:03.964
<i>And I have a problem if she finds out
my in-laws are in town.</i>

09:03.998 --> 09:06.266
So you sent them to a
casino with our credit card?

09:06.300 --> 09:09.369
Okay, David, I could not let my mother
ruin all of this.

09:09.403 --> 09:12.572
Oh, and they just spent $120
at the in-casino CVS.

09:12.607 --> 09:14.274
Imagine how long that
receipt's gonna be.

09:14.308 --> 09:15.875
Oh, please don't make me disappoint

09:15.910 --> 09:17.611
the one mother who's
actually proud of me.

09:17.645 --> 09:19.312
I got the brisket recipe.

09:19.347 --> 09:20.536
You've had it too good for too long,

09:20.582 --> 09:23.045
- so you don't appreciate it.
- I do too.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.151
My whole bar mitzvah speech
was about appreciation,

09:25.186 --> 09:27.320
and my parents said it was
one of the greatest speeches

09:27.355 --> 09:28.588
they have ever...

09:28.623 --> 09:30.090
Okay, I hear your point.

09:30.124 --> 09:32.583
Yeah, and if my mother takes me down,
you're going down with me,

09:32.661 --> 09:34.703
and then your parents are
gonna find out you're not

09:34.796 --> 09:36.683
the perfect Jewish golden
boy that you pretend to be.

09:36.765 --> 09:39.332
You are on a high pedestal,
man, and it is a long way down.

09:39.367 --> 09:40.567
Emet.

09:41.169 --> 09:42.335
Yeah, I do not want that to happen.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.237
- I'm my mother's masterpiece.
- Great.

09:44.272 --> 09:46.339
So let's keep up the ruse
and just cap her at $500.

09:46.374 --> 09:48.108
Okay. How about $650?
I really like my pedestal.

09:48.142 --> 09:49.609
- Fair.
- Yeah.

<i>I was right to send my parents away.</i>

10:12.199 --> 10:14.367
Oh, I just feel so sad that
your parents aren't here.

10:14.402 --> 10:15.935
Oh, oh, I know, I know,

10:15.970 --> 10:17.971
but they just couldn't
change their schedule.

10:18.005 --> 10:19.472
They so wanted to be here,

10:19.507 --> 10:22.442
but you know Indians and
their strict concept of time.

10:22.476 --> 10:23.624
No, I don't.

10:23.678 --> 10:25.945
But do you know there
are tribes in New Guinea

10:25.980 --> 10:28.181
where the women eat
their dead husbands' bodies

10:28.215 --> 10:30.183
to gain their virility... What a world.

10:30.217 --> 10:31.451
I did not know that.

10:31.485 --> 10:33.186
Emet, you know, it seems like

10:33.220 --> 10:35.355
we've just seen your parents
so little since the wedding.

10:35.389 --> 10:37.490
Maybe we should FaceTime them.

10:37.525 --> 10:39.059
Wait, wait, wait,
I got to get some lipstick.

10:39.093 --> 10:40.160
Um...

10:40.194 --> 10:41.461
<i>Quick, change the subject.</i>

10:41.495 --> 10:44.331
Uh, you know what
I have always regretted?

10:44.365 --> 10:46.333
Is that we didn't have a Jewish wedding.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.234
So we didn't get to break a glass.

10:48.269 --> 10:49.502
I didn't get lifted on a chair.

10:49.537 --> 10:51.671
It all just sounds so fun, you know?

10:51.706 --> 10:53.239
Well, it's never too late.

10:53.274 --> 10:54.641
David.

10:54.675 --> 10:56.543
- It's showtime.
- Oh-ho-ho!

10:57.089 --> 10:59.079
We'll do it right now.

10:59.113 --> 11:00.580
That's what I wanted.

11:00.614 --> 11:02.682
If I die, you're my favorite.

11:02.717 --> 11:04.351
- One...
- Two, three.

11:04.385 --> 11:06.086
- Careful.
- Whoa!

The power of the universe...

11:25.207 --> 11:28.331
I was just saying how lovely
it would be to see you.

11:28.342 --> 11:30.037
Let's go to the patio and catch up.

11:30.110 --> 11:32.672
Oh, Emet, doll,
could I bother for a blanket?

11:32.707 --> 11:33.445
Don't want a chill.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.847
Oh, yes, absolutely. I'll bring one out.

11:34.881 --> 11:36.115
Okay.

11:36.149 --> 11:37.783
You never give me blankets.

11:37.817 --> 11:39.918
And I'm constantly having a chill.

11:39.953 --> 11:41.753
Okay, well,
I can't help you with that, Mother.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.623
It's coming from your insides.
Anyway, how was Paula Abdul?

11:44.657 --> 11:45.858
I don't know.

11:45.892 --> 11:48.527
We left early for a much better show...

11:48.561 --> 11:52.097
our daughter starring in
a live version of "Yentl."

11:52.132 --> 11:54.566
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:54.601 --> 11:55.767
Oh, yes, you do.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.402
Happy Hanukkah!

11:57.437 --> 12:00.739
Here's a blanket.
Oh, have some rugelach.

12:00.858 --> 12:02.648
Maya, sorry to interrupt,

12:02.683 --> 12:03.609
but in your life,

12:03.643 --> 12:05.711
have you ever had a flakier rugelach?

12:05.745 --> 12:07.412
I have not.

12:09.749 --> 12:11.383
All right, fine.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.051
So we put on a little
show for David's parents.

12:13.086 --> 12:15.654
Is that so wrong? It makes Irene happy.

12:15.688 --> 12:18.423
Well, you fake it for Irene,
but you don't for me?

12:18.458 --> 12:21.393
Yeah, Ma, because she appreciates it.

12:21.427 --> 12:25.664
Oh. I didn't know that you
don't feel appreciated by me

12:25.698 --> 12:28.000
- but you do by Irene.
- Yeah, I do.

12:28.034 --> 12:30.602
I mean, she says, like,
six or seven nice things to me a day.

12:30.637 --> 12:31.904
Does she have a tumor?

12:31.938 --> 12:33.639
My friend Cecile says weird things,

12:33.673 --> 12:35.507
and she has a tumor.

12:35.542 --> 12:38.076
Okay, beta. I heard your words.

12:38.111 --> 12:40.012
And I'll think on it.

12:40.046 --> 12:41.780
Thank you.

12:41.814 --> 12:43.615
Now, in the spirit of the holidays,

12:43.650 --> 12:45.918
can't we just go pretend
to be a good Jewish family?

12:45.952 --> 12:48.453
Fine. Happy fake Hanukkah.

12:48.488 --> 12:49.988
I'll take it. Okay.

12:51.457 --> 12:52.624
Mm.

12:52.659 --> 12:55.827
Oh, thank you, darling.

12:59.899 --> 13:01.833
I brought you some tea.

13:04.237 --> 13:05.704
Come on, Maya.

13:05.738 --> 13:08.807
So what if Emet's immersing the kids
in their Jewish roots?

13:08.841 --> 13:10.709
It's good for them.

13:10.743 --> 13:14.846
And even we haven't been that diligent
about teaching them our Hindu culture.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.949
Most of our lessons are
in front of the spice rack

13:16.983 --> 13:18.217
at the supermarket.

13:18.251 --> 13:19.818
Oh, Googaloo.

13:19.852 --> 13:22.554
You always see the
bright side of things.

13:22.589 --> 13:24.489
But I've been thinking.

13:24.524 --> 13:25.958
And I've decided

13:25.992 --> 13:28.894
this is a culture war.

13:28.928 --> 13:30.862
And I must win.

13:30.897 --> 13:35.167
Are you sure this isn't about
Emet's affection for Irene?

13:35.745 --> 13:36.635
Okeydokey.

13:36.669 --> 13:38.136
Happy wife, happy life.

13:38.629 --> 13:39.572
Mm.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.740
<i>The Hanukkah party was only days away,</i>

13:41.774 --> 13:45.043
<i>and I was gonna go above and beyond
to make Irene proud,</i>

13:45.078 --> 13:46.078
<i>starting with the brisket.</i>

13:46.112 --> 13:48.247
Mmm. It's...

13:49.949 --> 13:51.984
Ooh, it's good.

13:52.018 --> 13:53.852
- It's not good enough.
- Oh.

13:53.886 --> 13:56.088
Good is not good enough
for this Hanukkah party.

13:56.122 --> 13:59.157
I'm gonna keep trying
until I get it great.

13:59.192 --> 14:00.592
♪ Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel ♪

14:00.627 --> 14:01.760
♪ I made it out of clay ♪

14:01.794 --> 14:03.562
Oh, look at that spin.

14:03.596 --> 14:06.765
You guys, you've got those
powerful Sweetzer wrists.

14:06.799 --> 14:08.233
Oh, looks like the gelt's all yours.

14:08.268 --> 14:10.502
Yes! Whoo!

14:10.536 --> 14:12.771
What, nothing for Pop Pop?

14:12.805 --> 14:14.539
Chocolate coins are fine.

14:14.574 --> 14:16.508
But in Hindu tradition,

14:16.542 --> 14:18.277
we give out real gold.

14:18.311 --> 14:23.115
Think of how much chocolate
you can buy with that.

14:24.122 --> 14:25.542
Who wants to hang some Hanukkah lights?

14:25.577 --> 14:27.619
- Uh, I do.
- Yes, it's the festival of lights.

14:27.654 --> 14:30.856
- I know.
- Hanukkah lights.

14:30.890 --> 14:32.958
Hanukkah is a festival of lights.

14:32.992 --> 14:35.927
But what about our festival
of lights... Diwali?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.563
Your parents don't make
a big enough deal about it,

14:38.598 --> 14:41.633
but in India, we throw down with a bang.

14:41.668 --> 14:44.569
I'm talking fireworks, baby.

14:44.604 --> 14:46.772
- Look.
- My God.

14:46.806 --> 14:49.241
- Shall we go to the park?
- Yes!

14:49.275 --> 14:50.976
<i>With the Hanukkah party a night away,</i>

14:51.010 --> 14:53.545
<i>I was gonna show Irene
just how excited I was.</i>

14:53.579 --> 14:55.080
Okay.

14:59.652 --> 15:00.986
Oh, oh, my...

15:02.019 --> 15:04.656
Oh, wow.

15:04.691 --> 15:05.924
Wow.

15:05.958 --> 15:08.660
I never would have thought of this.

15:08.695 --> 15:10.796
But I love it.

15:10.830 --> 15:13.031
I think you two must have been

15:13.632 --> 15:17.169
four or five years old the last time
we celebrated Holi properly.

15:17.203 --> 15:20.172
It's the Hindu celebration of spring.

15:20.206 --> 15:23.575
What do you say to a paint fight

15:23.609 --> 15:26.812
with every color you can imagine?

15:26.846 --> 15:29.848
It'll blow your socks
off your brains, man.

15:29.882 --> 15:32.150
Dang.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.322
Guys, I need your help.

15:37.357 --> 15:39.091
Amelia is on a rampage.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.361
Look, I was so nervous about
getting called out in the sack

15:42.395 --> 15:45.630
that I sort of stood her
up for our date last night.

15:45.665 --> 15:47.032
Where is Emet, all right?

15:47.066 --> 15:49.201
I need to warn her that
misrepresenting yourself

15:49.235 --> 15:51.903
can be very, very dangerous.

15:52.905 --> 15:54.339
Right here.

15:54.374 --> 15:56.341
What are you wearing?
What is that, a muumuu?

15:56.376 --> 15:57.876
Just settle down, it's a roomy tunic.

15:57.910 --> 15:59.378
I was bonding with my mother-in-law,

15:59.412 --> 16:01.113
and she took me shopping
for some party outfits.

16:01.894 --> 16:02.881
You, sir,

16:02.915 --> 16:05.150
are the most rude, disgusting,

16:05.184 --> 16:08.053
ill-mannered,
inconsiderate man I've ever met.

16:08.087 --> 16:10.355
Oh, snap.

16:10.390 --> 16:12.224
That's so American of you.

16:12.258 --> 16:14.159
Meet me in the supply closet in five.

16:15.928 --> 16:18.955
Okay, well, I'm gonna
sneak out the back door and walk home.

16:18.990 --> 16:21.233
Well, I'm going to the supply closet
and ask if she wants a real American.

16:21.267 --> 16:22.734
Oy vey, I got to go.

16:22.769 --> 16:24.002
It's almost sundown.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.038
I hate it here.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.174
<i>It's the night of the party.</i>

16:29.208 --> 16:31.743
<i>The room is buzzing,
and the guest list is a real who's...</i>

16:31.778 --> 16:33.078
<i>alive.</i>

16:33.430 --> 16:36.857
Okay!
Anyone for one last jelly doughnut?

16:36.892 --> 16:39.251
- Oh, me, me!
- Here you go.

16:39.285 --> 16:41.753
No, thanks. They look a little dry.

16:42.438 --> 16:43.755
All right. Jakey's asleep.

16:43.790 --> 16:45.991
Brisket time.
Where are the other ones?

16:46.025 --> 16:47.993
Louie, Lily, let's go, brisket time.

16:48.027 --> 16:49.261
Come on, why isn't anybody eating?

16:49.295 --> 16:51.029
- Let's go.
- Yeah, don't wait for the kids.

16:51.063 --> 16:53.098
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
- I just want to make a toast.

16:53.132 --> 16:56.435
I would like to thank David and Emet

16:56.469 --> 16:59.905
for making such a lovely Hanukkah.

16:59.939 --> 17:02.274
It really means...

17:02.308 --> 17:05.743
so much to me.

17:05.778 --> 17:07.012
Those are happy tears.

17:07.046 --> 17:09.281
Oh, Irene.

17:09.315 --> 17:11.249
Now I'm getting verklempt.

17:11.284 --> 17:12.951
Does that mean nauseated?

17:12.984 --> 17:14.719
Then I'm verklempt, too.

17:14.753 --> 17:16.788
Try to enjoy yourself.

17:16.823 --> 17:19.458
Oh, trust me, I will soon.

17:19.492 --> 17:23.895
And this year our Emet made the brisket,

17:23.930 --> 17:26.298
and she even attempted a tzimmes,

17:26.332 --> 17:29.768
which if anybody's tried it
knows how difficult that is.

17:29.802 --> 17:31.203
What the hell is going on?

17:31.237 --> 17:33.872
I buy mine now and then
just say I made it.

17:33.906 --> 17:35.740
The kids decided

17:35.775 --> 17:38.743
that they wanted to celebrate
their other culture, too.

17:38.778 --> 17:40.779
Happy Holi.

17:40.813 --> 17:42.047
What did you do?

17:44.041 --> 17:46.618
- Don't worry about it.
- This is so much fun.

17:46.706 --> 17:47.606
- Awesome.
- Hey, hey!

17:47.674 --> 17:48.706
What are you guys doing?

17:48.709 --> 17:51.157
You are supposed to be inside
ready for the Hanukkah party!

17:51.211 --> 17:53.612
Grandma reminded us we
haven't celebrated Holi

17:53.646 --> 17:54.980
in a very long time.

17:55.014 --> 17:58.116
Yes, because it is messy
and we have new patio furniture, okay?

17:58.150 --> 18:00.018
We will celebrate next spring.
Just get inside.

18:00.052 --> 18:01.653
This party is important
to Nana and Pop Pop.

18:01.687 --> 18:03.788
Sorry, Mom.
Call me when you light a menorah

18:03.823 --> 18:05.790
and it shoots up into
the sky and explodes.

18:05.825 --> 18:06.992
I can actually end you.

18:07.026 --> 18:08.793
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:08.828 --> 18:11.596
What is so important that
it interrupted my toast?

18:11.631 --> 18:14.063
- Sorry, it's just...
- Oh, the kids are celebrating Holi...

18:14.098 --> 18:15.133
that's from my culture...

18:15.167 --> 18:17.102
because I won the war.

18:17.136 --> 18:19.804
Oh, I have dreaded this moment
since the first day we met.

18:19.839 --> 18:21.840
What... what's she talking about?
What war?

18:21.874 --> 18:24.709
She's in a war for cultural dominance.
I can't take it.

18:24.744 --> 18:27.712
Maya, their god commands
them to eat jelly doughnuts.

18:27.747 --> 18:29.648
How can we fight such a glorious god?

18:29.682 --> 18:32.501
Stay out of this.
This is not about religion.

18:32.536 --> 18:33.685
It's about culture.

18:33.719 --> 18:36.121
When I come home and
find my grandchildren

18:36.155 --> 18:38.056
fully immersed in your traditions,

18:38.090 --> 18:42.661
it's a slap in the face to me
and all my ancestors.

18:42.695 --> 18:45.130
- Mom...
- What about my ancestors?

18:45.164 --> 18:46.164
How do you think my dead mother...

18:46.198 --> 18:47.666
may she rest in peace...

18:47.700 --> 18:51.336
felt when she had to see
David get married without a rabbi?

18:51.370 --> 18:53.838
The only reason we agreed
to an Indian wedding

18:53.873 --> 18:56.675
was because Emet promised
to raise the kids Jewish.

18:56.709 --> 18:57.809
Wait, what?

18:57.843 --> 19:00.011
Hey, that's what you think.

19:00.046 --> 19:01.713
They fake it for you.

19:01.747 --> 19:03.748
They're only Jewish
two weeks of the year,

19:03.783 --> 19:05.183
and that's when you're around.

19:05.217 --> 19:06.217
What?

19:06.252 --> 19:07.752
- David!
- Hold on, in all fairness,

19:07.787 --> 19:10.021
most of the Jews we know are only Jewish
two weeks a year, right?

19:10.056 --> 19:13.758
Mom, I had one week
where I wasn't trying to make you happy

19:13.793 --> 19:15.193
and people were lifting me up...
Actually, by the way,

19:15.227 --> 19:16.828
lifting me up, in a chair.

19:16.862 --> 19:18.229
And you couldn't even let me have that.

19:18.264 --> 19:20.031
You want to celebrate our culture?

19:20.066 --> 19:22.000
- Great, let's do it.
- No, no, no!

19:22.034 --> 19:23.101
- Oh!
- What?

19:23.135 --> 19:25.103
What? That's how it works, right?

19:25.137 --> 19:27.038
We just throw the colors at each other.

19:27.073 --> 19:30.041
- That's true, so take that!
- Oh, my God.

19:30.076 --> 19:33.078
I can't believe that you've
been lying to me all this time.

19:33.112 --> 19:34.713
Go ahead, do it. You know you want to.

19:34.747 --> 19:37.048
Holi is also about losing
all your inhibitions.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.883
- Mom, no.
- Let it rip, baby.

19:38.918 --> 19:40.619
- She's not...
- Mom...

19:40.653 --> 19:42.887
Oh, Mom!
The light is flowing through you!

19:42.922 --> 19:44.222
- Love this.
- Ma.

19:44.256 --> 19:47.033
I cannot believe that you guilted Emet

19:47.068 --> 19:48.259
'cause we wanted an Indian wedding!

19:48.294 --> 19:51.630
Oh, do not disrespect your mother!

19:51.664 --> 19:53.898
I don't know why I did that,
but I'm going to do it again!

19:53.933 --> 19:56.234
I loved our Indian wedding.
I rode a horse.

19:56.268 --> 19:58.737
Best holiday ever!

19:58.771 --> 19:59.776
Get the kids!

20:00.640 --> 20:02.907
- What are you doing?
- This is a holiday?

20:02.942 --> 20:04.477
Yeah, you better move.

20:05.811 --> 20:08.213
My God, I didn't think that Indian woman

20:08.247 --> 20:09.814
would do a good job with the brisket.

20:09.849 --> 20:11.416
This is melting in my mouth.

20:11.450 --> 20:12.784
Benny, did you taste?

20:12.818 --> 20:14.285
Melting.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.754
How do you like that?

20:15.788 --> 20:18.289
Oh, beautiful.

20:18.324 --> 20:20.258
Now light a diya for Diwali.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.327
It was a few weeks ago.

20:22.361 --> 20:25.063
Oh, lovely.

20:25.097 --> 20:26.631
All right.

20:26.666 --> 20:27.632
Mwah.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.167
Listen, we are sorry.

20:29.201 --> 20:30.902
We did not want to lie to you.

20:30.936 --> 20:32.937
We just didn't want to disappoint you.

20:32.972 --> 20:34.773
Oh, it's okay, honey... I understand

20:34.807 --> 20:37.275
the whole "mother-in-law
disappointment" hooplah.

20:37.309 --> 20:40.721
Let me just say I'm really
glad Max's mother is dead.

20:40.756 --> 20:41.788
As am I.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.915
Every holiday was like
trying to keep two bats

20:43.949 --> 20:46.184
from gnawing each other's ears off.

20:46.218 --> 20:48.286
Look, the truth is
we both get so caught up

20:48.320 --> 20:50.121
with everything that's
going on in our lives,

20:50.156 --> 20:51.790
we kind of half-ass both cultures.

20:51.824 --> 20:53.124
Yeah, but we can do better, right?

20:53.159 --> 20:54.325
I mean, like, this was pretty cool.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.960
- Yes.
- I mean, maybe we can celebrate

20:56.028 --> 20:57.462
whatever the hell
this holiday was every year.

20:57.496 --> 20:58.797
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

20:58.831 --> 21:00.265
I call it Diwanukkah.

21:00.299 --> 21:01.666
Oh!

21:01.701 --> 21:03.468
- We like that.
- I like it, too.

21:03.502 --> 21:05.270
Diwanukkah lives!

21:07.073 --> 21:09.274
Happy Diwanukkah!

21:09.308 --> 21:11.009
Happy Diwanukkah.
