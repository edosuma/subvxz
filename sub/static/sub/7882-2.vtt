the boat sinks?

20:03.946 --> 20:05.813
Mm, as soon
as the painter's tape

20:05.865 --> 20:09.199
that's covering the big hole
in the bottom disintegrates.

20:09.235 --> 20:10.401
Well, let's go get 'em

20:10.453 --> 20:12.820
and collect
that sweet boat insurance.

20:12.872 --> 20:14.788
Boat insurance?
Who insures a boat?

20:14.824 --> 20:16.907
I thought the play was
life insurance.

20:16.909 --> 20:18.242
What?

20:18.244 --> 20:19.910
I took out a very aggressive
policy on Jeff.

20:19.912 --> 20:22.162
Damn it, Roger,
we can't let them drown!

20:22.214 --> 20:25.416
It's, uh, it's actually a pretty
important part of the plan.

20:25.468 --> 20:27.468
The -- the, uh, crux,
if you will.

20:27.503 --> 20:29.253
Ugh, forget it. They lived.

20:31.140 --> 20:34.091
[ Panting ] That was horrible!
The boat just sank!

20:34.093 --> 20:36.260
And the life jackets
didn't help at all!

20:36.312 --> 20:38.262
It's like they're filled
with sand.

20:38.314 --> 20:40.347
Roger!
It wasn't me!

20:40.399 --> 20:42.483
Wait a minute.
[ Click ]

20:45.488 --> 20:47.104
Cocaine!

20:47.156 --> 20:48.989
Stan, do you know what
this means?!

20:49.025 --> 20:50.441
I sure do.

20:50.493 --> 20:52.672
It means all three of you
are going to prison.

20:53.488 --> 20:54.580
Wait, what?

20:55.175 --> 20:59.051
