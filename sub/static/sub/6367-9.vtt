He wants Proctor out

14:21.885 --> 14:24.421
You've nothing to worry about.

14:24.454 --> 14:27.558
But I am worried, Rebecca.

14:27.591 --> 14:29.463
I don't doubt for a
moment Proctor's lawyers

14:29.496 --> 14:32.164
will buy his way out
of a few gun charges.

14:32.197 --> 14:34.396
But the cops have papers
linking him to the Kinaho Moon

14:34.429 --> 14:36.267
and I can't have that.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.570
That sounds like something

14:38.603 --> 14:41.002
you should talk to him
about when he gets out.

14:41.035 --> 14:43.473
<i>- Siobhan: Why now?
- What?</i>

14:43.506 --> 14:45.505
Proctor...  why now?

14:45.538 --> 14:47.501
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

14:47.542 --> 14:49.138
<i>I don't know why you're here.</i>

14:49.171 --> 14:50.802
I've been trying to pinpoint in my mind

14:50.843 --> 14:52.939
what it is about you...
procedure, protocols, laws...

14:52.972 --> 14:54.876
you just don't have
patience for any of it.

14:55.782 --> 14:57.318
Rebecca,

14:57.351 --> 14:59.812
your uncle has had a long run,

14:59.853 --> 15:02.513
but his luck's about to run out.

15:02.554 --> 15:04.681
I don't think that they're
gonna take him down for this,

15:04.722 --> 15:07.523
I know it, because I'm
gonna help them do it.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.757
Why are you telling me this?

15:11.927 --> 15:15.033
It's time for you to make a choice.

15:18.806 --> 15:21.235
Why me?

15:23.107 --> 15:24.770
I like you.

15:24.803 --> 15:27.305
[chuckles]

15:53.973 --> 15:56.509
The warrant is specific to the basement

15:56.574 --> 15:58.941
and excludes any and all
other rooms of the house.

15:58.974 --> 16:01.844
So, it could be argued
that the subbasement

16:01.877 --> 16:03.884
in which the contraband was found

16:03.917 --> 16:06.852
wasn't on the warrant and
is, therefore, inadmissible.

16:06.885 --> 16:09.020
- Would that work?
- 50/50.

16:09.053 --> 16:10.724
Depends on the judge.

16:10.757 --> 16:12.860
Meanwhile, I'm pushing
for a new bail hearing.

16:12.893 --> 16:15.356
The A.D.A. is arguing flight risk.

16:15.397 --> 16:18.228
But all the new ones do that,
so I will push it through.

16:18.261 --> 16:20.164
It'll just take a day or two.

16:20.197 --> 16:23.364
- What about Longshadow?
- Well, that's a whole 'nother ball of wax.

16:23.404 --> 16:27.066
- You sure he's gonna go through with it?
- Rebecca: He seemed very sure.

16:27.107 --> 16:30.000
Yeah. Well, we'll have
to see what he's got.

16:30.041 --> 16:32.737
<i>Until then, my number one

16:32.778 --> 16:35.611

16:35.644 --> 16:38.450
- Thank you.
- Rebecca, I will wait for you outside.

It never rains, but it pours.

16:50.555 --> 16:51.954
You're worried about Alex?

Well, he picked a hell of
a time to grow some balls.

do anything about that?

17:00.333 --> 17:01.468

18:12.870 --> 18:15.508
A mother hears her son is alone

18:15.541 --> 18:17.644
and in trouble.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.676
Well...

18:21.717 --> 18:25.113
I've been alone for
many years, Mother...

18:25.146 --> 18:28.076
for my entire adult life.

18:30.748 --> 18:32.915
As have I.

18:35.717 --> 18:38.219
Does my father know you're here?

18:39.818 --> 18:42.151
Your father demands contrition

18:42.192 --> 18:45.022
from everyone except himself.

18:47.696 --> 18:50.064
As I get older,

18:50.097 --> 18:53.336
I have far less patience for arrogance

18:53.369 --> 18:55.565
disguised as righteousness.

18:56.765 --> 19:00.466
- And yet you stay.
- And yet I stay.

19:02.739 --> 19:05.601
I was not raised to think
there was another way.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.912
By the time I came to it on my own,

19:09.945 --> 19:11.973
I was an old lady.

19:19.517 --> 19:21.948
I failed you, Kai.

19:21.981 --> 19:25.953
I let the dogma of small-minded men

19:25.986 --> 19:27.448
determine your fate

19:27.489 --> 19:30.485
when I should have
been protecting you...

19:30.518 --> 19:33.590
the way any other mother in the world

19:33.623 --> 19:35.421
<i>would have protected her young.</i>

19:35.454 --> 19:39.492
<i>And now I see you in here, and I know</i>

19:39.525 --> 19:42.393
<i>that we put you here...</i>

19:42.426 --> 19:44.559
your father and I.

19:52.470 --> 19:56.433
Your crimes, whatever they may be,

19:56.466 --> 19:59.231
are my crimes.

20:02.672 --> 20:04.872
[sobs softly]

20:16.577 --> 20:18.947
May I come see you again?

20:25.555 --> 20:27.688
Yeah.

20:30.456 --> 20:33.494
<i>[door slides open]</i>

20:37.097 --> 20:39.167
<i>[slides shut]</i>

20:39.200 --> 20:41.334
<i>[distant siren wailing]</i>

20:51.977 --> 20:54.949
<i>[door opens]
Can I help you?</i>

20:54.982 --> 20:59.115
Captain Julias Bonner, NYPD.

20:59.148 --> 21:01.083
<i>So you are not here to pray?</i>

21:01.116 --> 21:02.755
No.

21:02.821 --> 21:04.788
Just doing a little legwork for the FBI.

21:04.821 --> 21:09.690
- Priest: Where is Agent Racine?
- They don't seem to know.

21:09.723 --> 21:12.458
Maybe that's why they
asked me to drop by...

21:12.491 --> 21:14.559
to see if maybe you knew.

21:14.592 --> 21:17.432
I haven't seen Agent Racine in a while.

21:17.465 --> 21:20.000
He was not a healthy man.

21:20.033 --> 21:23.136
<i>Bonner: But he did come
in here from time to time.</i>

21:23.169 --> 21:26.237
Yes. He was looking for my brother.

21:26.270 --> 21:28.601
I take it you haven't
heard from him, either.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.633
If I had, do you think I would tell you?

21:30.674 --> 21:33.408
No, I guess you wouldn't.

21:33.441 --> 21:36.177
I don't suppose you'd allow
me to search the place.

21:36.210 --> 21:40.081
Yes, of course, as soon as
you show me your warrant.

21:40.114 --> 21:43.587
Why all this interest? Surely
you have more pressing cases.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.452
[chuckles] Oh, yes.

21:45.485 --> 21:48.122
But you never seem to
forget the one that got away.

21:48.187 --> 21:50.519
I almost nailed him a long time ago.

21:50.553 --> 21:53.926
I picked up this kid
doing a job for him.

21:53.991 --> 21:55.389
Diamonds.

21:57.296 --> 21:58.728
It's for you.

21:58.761 --> 22:01.965
Turns out it was Rabbit
who tipped us off.

22:01.998 --> 22:06.665
<i>I tried to turn the kid, but he was,</i>

22:06.698 --> 22:09.634
you know, committed.

22:09.667 --> 22:13.507
Everyone must live or
die by their own code.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.544
Of course.

22:16.577 --> 22:20.975
[chuckles] Well, you
have a good day, Father.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.584
Have a good day.

22:24.754 --> 22:26.522
<i>Rabbit: They're closing in...</i>

22:26.555 --> 22:30.184
the intruder last night, now this cop.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.359
They will be here soon.

22:32.392 --> 22:35.823
I had hoped to be a bit stronger

22:35.856 --> 22:37.897
when I faced them.

22:37.930 --> 22:41.297
<i>[heart monitor beeping]</i>

22:44.672 --> 22:47.532
<i>Priest: It was a mistake
sending the assassin after them.</i>

22:47.565 --> 22:49.467
We should have waited
until you were healthy.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.306
The only mistake was her failure.

22:52.339 --> 22:53.675
You could not have foreseen that.

22:53.708 --> 22:56.910
<i>[beeping accelerates]</i>

22:59.949 --> 23:02.050
<i>[rapid beeping]</i>

23:02.083 --> 23:03.577
[yelps]

23:03.618 --> 23:05.552
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm a nurse, man.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.614
<i>Rabbit: What about this intruder?</i>

23:07.647 --> 23:10.784
He proved more resourceful
than we imagined.

23:10.825 --> 23:13.789
There are only so many hospitals
in the city. We will find him.

23:13.822 --> 23:15.523
- Job: Which one?
- New York Presbyterian.

23:15.556 --> 23:19.288
- Was I shot?
- No, dude. You got hit by a car.

23:19.321 --> 23:21.289
Rabbit: We have to assume
he will get word to them.

23:21.322 --> 23:24.298
<i>He was badly hurt. He may
not get word to anyone.</i>

23:24.331 --> 23:27.603
- How long have I been here?
- I don't know. My shift started at noon.

23:27.636 --> 23:29.033
- Are the cops here?
- Why would the cops be here?

23:29.066 --> 23:30.895
<i>Priest: I have called everyone in.</i>

23:30.936 --> 23:32.904
We will be ready for them.

23:32.937 --> 23:34.801
What the hell are you doing?
No, you can't get out of bed.

23:34.842 --> 23:36.873
- Tell me where my fucking clothes are.
- You can't go anywhere.

23:36.906 --> 23:39.744
- They're gonna fucking kill me, man.
- No one's gonna kill you.

23:39.777 --> 23:42.480
- They're gonna fucking kill me.
- You have a serious concussion. You can't go anywhere.

23:42.513 --> 23:44.248
- The fuck I can't.
- Please just get back in the bed!

23:44.281 --> 23:46.751
- I need some help in here!
- Get the fuck off me!

23:46.784 --> 23:48.150
[panting]

23:48.183 --> 23:50.685
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

23:50.718 --> 23:52.716
It's all right. I just got here.

23:52.749 --> 23:55.115
Hey, Laura, can I get a cup of coffee?

23:57.851 --> 24:00.089
A few days ago, that building blew up.

24:00.122 --> 24:02.457
Word is it was an ecstasy lab.

24:02.490 --> 24:04.024
Proctor?

24:04.057 --> 24:07.527
Well, not that we can prove, but, yeah.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.895
Thanks.

24:08.928 --> 24:11.167
I've requested a forensics
team from the DEA,

24:11.200 --> 24:13.703
but first they gotta find us on a map.

24:15.335 --> 24:17.301
So I'm guessing this is
not a defective gas line.

24:17.334 --> 24:20.540
Mm-mm, truck went through a wall
and then the place went sky-high.

24:23.972 --> 24:25.906
Is that it? I mean, why
are you showing me this?

24:25.939 --> 24:27.505
Because the day before this happened,

24:27.546 --> 24:29.943
I was out there with Hood and
Emmett. We shook down some guys.

24:29.976 --> 24:31.774
We found out this is where
they're making the drugs.

24:31.807 --> 24:33.813
<i>And Hood desperately
wanted to tie it to Proctor,</i>

24:33.846 --> 24:36.679
<i>- but we couldn't.
- And then it blows up.</i>

24:37.648 --> 24:39.015
Just like that.

24:39.055 --> 24:40.420
And then he busts Proctor on a warrant

24:40.453 --> 24:42.850
based on information from
a confidential informant.

24:42.883 --> 24:46.184
Exactly. And I wouldn't bet
the farm on that warrant.

24:46.217 --> 24:48.353
Shit.

24:50.396 --> 24:52.733
What the hell is he up to?

24:59.930 --> 25:02.336
George.

25:02.369 --> 25:04.872
Long day?

25:04.905 --> 25:06.903
The only kind I seem
to be having these days.

25:06.936 --> 25:08.039
Drink?

25:08.072 --> 25:09.710
No.

25:11.807 --> 25:14.646
That was some stunt you
pulled with the council.

25:14.679 --> 25:18.080
Oh, George, don't be a sore loser.

25:19.090 --> 25:20.689
Men voted their consciences.

25:22.225 --> 25:23.487
Well, I'm sure you've heard

25:23.520 --> 25:25.255
that your good friend Proctor

25:25.288 --> 25:27.826
has once again been incarcerated.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.668
Proctor's no friend of mine.

25:31.701 --> 25:33.203
As a matter of fact, I'm taking measures

25:33.237 --> 25:35.506
to make sure he goes down for the count.

25:37.938 --> 25:40.872
Maybe I underestimated you.

25:42.873 --> 25:47.052
But maybe you underestimated me, too.

25:52.954 --> 25:55.288
This dagger

25:55.321 --> 25:58.491
belonged to my great-grandfather.

25:58.525 --> 26:00.597
It's handed down as a totem

26:00.630 --> 26:04.070
to the first-born
male of each generation

26:04.103 --> 26:06.237
when he comes of age.

26:06.270 --> 26:08.970
<i>So far, every man in my family</i>

26:09.003 --> 26:11.074
who has carried this knife

26:11.107 --> 26:13.244
has had occasion to use it.

26:13.277 --> 26:16.952
Of course, I have no sons.

26:21.949 --> 26:25.126
Is this your occasion, George?

26:25.159 --> 26:27.497
Is that why you're here?

26:33.338 --> 26:35.868
I didn't think so.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.162
[sighs]

26:41.340 --> 26:43.646
<i>[thumps]
[gasps]</i>

26:43.679 --> 26:47.479
<i>[footsteps receding]
[door opens]</i>

26:57.021 --> 27:00.463
<i>Carrie: It's hard to
know when I realized it.</i>

27:00.496 --> 27:03.494
Little girls love their fathers.

27:03.527 --> 27:06.101
And mine was so loving,

27:06.134 --> 27:08.333
so attentive.

27:08.366 --> 27:10.134
And he kept me in this little world,

27:10.167 --> 27:14.513
and I had no other
reality to compare it to.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.111
So what changed?

27:19.144 --> 27:21.247
Kids in school.

27:22.551 --> 27:24.686
They started to tease me.

27:24.719 --> 27:27.184
And you know how kids can be.

27:29.959 --> 27:33.059
Then this one day, I was
walking home from school

27:33.092 --> 27:35.154
and I passed by a newsstand.

27:37.291 --> 27:40.993
And my father's picture was on
the front page of every paper.

27:42.064 --> 27:44.461
<i>So I bought a copy and I read it.</i>

27:44.494 --> 27:46.658
And I didn't understand
much... I was about 11,

27:46.691 --> 27:48.466
but I understood enough.

27:49.996 --> 27:53.236
They were saying that my
father had had people killed.

27:54.805 --> 27:57.205
So I took the paper and
I put it on his pillow...

27:58.078 --> 28:00.242
and I went to sleep.

28:00.275 --> 28:02.471
And then the next morning,
he was sitting in my room

28:02.504 --> 28:05.143
in an old rocking chair
I had in the corner,

28:05.176 --> 28:09.279
just rocking back and
forth, staring at me.

28:09.312 --> 28:12.048
And for the first time in
my life, I was scared of him.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.320
<i>Jesus, Carrie.</i>

28:18.251 --> 28:21.120
But then he picked me up...

28:21.153 --> 28:24.153
put me in his lap, and
I was barely awake...

28:27.530 --> 28:29.161
kissed me on my head,

28:29.194 --> 28:31.297
and just rocked me back and forth

28:31.330 --> 28:33.925
<i>and I almost fell asleep again.</i>

28:39.565 --> 28:41.869
He was my daddy.

28:42.774 --> 28:44.541
Hey...

28:46.479 --> 28:47.975
that's enough.

28:48.016 --> 28:50.610
You'll have plenty of time
to tell me the rest of it.

28:52.274 --> 28:55.578
- Yeah, I should get going.
- No, no, no. Shh.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.251
No.

28:59.453 --> 29:01.557
No, you shouldn't.

29:11.432 --> 29:13.303
You okay?

29:15.208 --> 29:18.769
Yeah. I'm just thinking about Emmett.

29:20.003 --> 29:21.410
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:21.443 --> 29:24.380
I just can't believe
he lost it like that.

29:28.052 --> 29:29.946
Well, I don't think he did lose it.

29:29.979 --> 29:32.354
I think he made a conscious choice.

29:33.388 --> 29:35.987
They hurt his family,

29:36.020 --> 29:38.796
- he needed to make 'em pay.
- We would have made them pay.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.893
Yeah, but he needed it to come from him.

29:40.926 --> 29:43.165
Think of it like you and Breece.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.994
<i>Look, there is a point at which</i>

29:46.035 --> 29:48.435
<i>any one of us will do
exactly what Emmett did.</i>

29:48.468 --> 29:51.205
It's just a question of what
puts us in that situation

29:51.238 --> 29:55.278
where the circumstances
outweigh the consequences.

29:55.311 --> 29:58.643
We go to the Cadi every day and we're
supposed to be dealing in justice,

29:58.676 --> 30:01.082
but...

30:01.115 --> 30:03.715
all we're really doing is
enforcing a set of rules.

30:04.788 --> 30:08.523
<i>But justice... real justice...</i>

30:08.556 --> 30:10.788
is personal.

30:12.262 --> 30:13.925
Sometimes the only way to get it

30:13.966 --> 30:15.460
is with your own two hands.

30:15.501 --> 30:19.467
You scare the shit out of me
when you say things like that.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.499
You're the one that
wanted me to talk more.

30:21.532 --> 30:24.669
[cell phone ringing]
Yeah, I'm starting to have second thoughts.

30:28.875 --> 30:31.474
[Siobhan giggles]

30:31.515 --> 30:34.751
You're the only sheriff that
doesn't answer his phone.

30:36.289 --> 30:38.225
<i>[ringing continues]</i>

30:38.258 --> 30:41.327
- What?
- You need to get your ass to New York now.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.126
Job?

30:43.159 --> 30:44.894
<i>I'm in deep shit here, man.</i>

30:44.927 --> 30:46.830
Whoa, slow down, slow
down. Where are you?

30:46.863 --> 30:48.264
In the hospital is where I am.

30:48.297 --> 30:50.369
New York Presbyterian, room 307.

30:50.402 --> 30:53.041
<i>- And if Rabbit get here first, I'll be...
- You found him?</i>

30:53.906 --> 30:55.504
Yeah, I found him.

30:57.242 --> 31:01.283
- Now he gonna find me.
- I'm on my way.

31:01.316 --> 31:04.355
- What? What's wrong?
- I have to go.

31:04.388 --> 31:06.219
What, just like that?

31:06.252 --> 31:09.092
You don't think I'm entitled to
more of an explanation than that?

31:09.125 --> 31:12.793
Yeah, you are, but right
now I just don't have time.

31:12.826 --> 31:14.858
Well, are you coming back?

31:14.899 --> 31:17.762
- Not tonight.
- How about ever?

31:20.570 --> 31:22.433
I don't know.

31:22.466 --> 31:25.868
- Then don't go.
- I have to.

31:25.901 --> 31:28.332
[sighs]

31:28.373 --> 31:29.974
I don't think I can do this anymore.
