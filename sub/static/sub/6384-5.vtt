00:00.500 --> 00:02.400
Previously on "californication"...

00:02.500 --> 00:03.434
Hey, know you.

00:03.468 --> 00:05.332
Charlie runkle. daisy. daisy.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.570
That's actually my ride.

00:06.604 --> 00:08.672
You going to the set? I'll come with.

00:08.707 --> 00:10.574
Did you negotiate, daisy?

00:10.608 --> 00:11.600
Did you lay out clear rules for

00:11.700 --> 00:12.810
what you will and will not do?

00:12.844 --> 00:15.145
-No. -that's it! bigs, stop the van!

00:15.180 --> 00:17.881
Get the fuck out! you're going too, sweetheart.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.950
Let's go!

00:22.053 --> 00:24.355
Judas priest, hank.

00:24.389 --> 00:25.622
What are you up to?

00:25.657 --> 00:28.625
I was hoping you'd finally make an honest woman of me.

00:28.660 --> 00:29.693
So you're pregnant, right?

00:29.728 --> 00:30.661
Yeah. I am pregnant. yes.

00:30.695 --> 00:33.330
I think what you're saying, sonja,

00:33.365 --> 00:36.767
That hank could very well be the father of the child, right?

00:36.801 --> 00:37.801
God, I'm sorry.

00:37.836 --> 00:39.903
I didn't want it to come out like this.

00:39.938 --> 00:42.239
I made a huge mistake. no.

00:42.273 --> 00:45.042
Marrying bill was definitely not the answer.

00:45.076 --> 00:46.377
Don't.

00:46.411 --> 00:49.113
Neither is marrying you.

00:49.147 --> 00:50.781
I...

00:52.517 --> 00:54.818
I can't stay.

Wo hey.

01:42.767 --> 01:45.769
There you go. that's probably enough.

01:45.804 --> 01:47.771
Whoa! gorgeous, huh?

01:47.806 --> 01:50.741
And now let's check on those onnies

01:50.775 --> 01:52.576
That we've got going here.

01:52.610 --> 01:53.911
Whoa! yum, yum...

01:53.945 --> 01:54.978
Hello!

01:56.381 --> 01:58.615
You look like ass!

01:58.650 --> 02:02.519
That's funny, 'cause I feel like ass!

02:02.554 --> 02:05.289
Ass that's been rid hard and put away wet.

02:06.458 --> 02:07.658
Drink.

02:11.162 --> 02:13.764
Re-e-e-vitalize!

02:16.601 --> 02:18.902
Ah! geez, that's full of vodka.

02:18.937 --> 02:19.970
Yeah.

02:21.573 --> 02:25.109
Ohh, these onnies smell yummy!

02:25.143 --> 02:28.045
All right. let's put some more in there.

02:28.079 --> 02:29.079
Why not, right?

02:29.114 --> 02:30.781
Everybody loves onions.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.851
Ahh! tear, tear.

02:33.885 --> 02:35.854
Sometimes these onions are just too much

02:35.854 --> 02:36.888
for this little gal

02:36.888 --> 02:38.922
Chloekins has a trick for everything.

02:38.957 --> 02:41.025
Spesh, right?

02:41.059 --> 02:42.626
There's something about that woman.

02:42.694 --> 02:43.329
I want to fuck her,

02:43.329 --> 02:45.363
but I kind of want to punch her in the face, too

02:45.363 --> 02:46.263
It's weird.

02:46.297 --> 02:48.732
Ha-ha! you want to hate-fuck her.

02:48.767 --> 02:51.101
No worries. we'll get her for you.

02:51.136 --> 02:52.970
Get who for me? chloe metz?

02:53.004 --> 02:54.438
I know people.

02:54.472 --> 02:56.607
Yeah, I know people, too. they're not magicians.

02:56.641 --> 02:59.209
Well, you don't know the right people.

02:59.244 --> 03:01.111
You're in ashby's world now.

03:01.146 --> 03:02.880
Drink the fuck up!

03:03.982 --> 03:05.949
Refresh yourself.

03:05.984 --> 03:08.552
Baking's easy when you're cooking with chloe!

04:01.039 --> 04:03.207
What are you doing here?

04:03.274 --> 04:04.375
Come on.

04:04.409 --> 04:06.577
Quit acting like you're not happy to see me.

04:06.611 --> 04:07.611
Hug back.

04:07.645 --> 04:09.913
Shower the people you love with love.

04:09.948 --> 04:12.282
We don't care what the mean girls think.

04:12.317 --> 04:13.851
Is something wrong?

04:13.885 --> 04:15.152
Why? it's wednesday, 3:00 p.m.,

04:15.186 --> 04:18.122
Close enough to the dot

04:18.156 --> 04:19.523
that I don't have to apologize for leaving you stranded.

04:19.557 --> 04:21.725
It's tuesday. mom picks me up on tuesdays.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.794
It is wednesday.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.196
No, it's not.

04:26.231 --> 04:27.464
Really?

04:27.499 --> 04:29.933
cause I've got a serious hump-day vibe happening.

04:29.968 --> 04:31.468
You sure?

04:31.503 --> 04:33.270
There's mom.

04:33.304 --> 04:35.606
Aw, shit.

04:35.674 --> 04:36.774
Uh, hi.

04:36.808 --> 04:38.142
"hi" to you on this --

04:38.176 --> 04:40.477
This is a beautiful weekday, isn't it?

04:40.512 --> 04:42.680
What are you doing here? well, I was in the neighborhood,

04:42.714 --> 04:44.448
So I thought I'd grab a few minutes

04:44.482 --> 04:45.949
Of father/daughter rapprochement

04:45.984 --> 04:48.252
Before you swoop by to pick the little monster up.

04:48.286 --> 04:50.587
So...you think it's wednesday.

04:50.622 --> 04:52.256
Come on.

04:52.290 --> 04:53.590
I plead the 5th.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.193
Of vodka. I can smell it on you.

04:56.227 --> 04:59.096
You can't smell vodka. that's the beauty of it.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.698
Are you staying at lew ashby's?

05:00.732 --> 05:01.899
For the time being, yes.

05:01.933 --> 05:04.268
We haven't printed the formal announcements yet.

05:04.302 --> 05:07.071
Okay. do you think that's such a great idea?

05:07.105 --> 05:08.138
The road to lew ashby's house

05:08.173 --> 05:10.507
Is paved with goodish intentions.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.910
Thank you for asking. I'll be fine.

05:12.944 --> 05:15.079
Hey, why don't you take becca home?

05:15.113 --> 05:17.047
You guys haven't hung out in a while,

05:17.082 --> 05:18.148
And you're here, so...

05:18.183 --> 05:19.416
What do you say, uzbekistan,

05:19.451 --> 05:21.452
You want to wile away an hour with your old man?

05:21.486 --> 05:23.020
Grab some ice cream?

05:23.054 --> 05:25.055
You down for some 31 flavors?

05:25.090 --> 05:26.323
I'm not a child.

05:26.358 --> 05:28.826
Well, I am, so I am desperately hoping

05:28.860 --> 05:31.362
There's some "very berry" something or other

05:31.396 --> 05:32.763
In my immediate future.

05:32.797 --> 05:33.997
Into the chariot.

05:34.032 --> 05:35.666
That's great.

05:35.734 --> 05:38.435
Have a good time, sweetie.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.170
So, drive safe --

05:40.205 --> 05:41.472
This sucks.

05:43.475 --> 05:45.175
Goodbye, hank.

05:45.210 --> 05:46.010
Goodbye.

05:46.044 --> 05:48.812
Where have I heard that before?

05:48.847 --> 05:49.780
Oh, yeah.

05:49.814 --> 05:52.316
I remember.

05:57.655 --> 05:59.556
This sucks.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.328
Great minds think alike.

06:10.869 --> 06:13.137
Hello. Hot lips.

06:13.171 --> 06:15.472
No, I'm not a deep-voiced woman.

06:15.507 --> 06:18.175
I'm just helping my wife out.

06:18.209 --> 06:20.778
Yeah, that's right -- the masturbating agent.

06:20.812 --> 06:22.413
Can I help you or what?

06:23.782 --> 06:26.717
What, exactly, might that be?

06:26.751 --> 06:29.420
Ouch. hold on. I'm gonna have to ask.

06:29.454 --> 06:32.423
Baby, do we do balls?!

06:32.457 --> 06:35.292
Shh! what the fuck is wrong with you?!

06:35.360 --> 06:36.960
Got ladies present.

06:36.995 --> 06:39.329
And no, sir, we don't do balls.

06:39.364 --> 06:42.199
I'm sorry. we don't do balls.

06:45.403 --> 06:47.438
Hey! hey! it's Daisy!

06:47.472 --> 06:49.473
Daisy, how you doing?

06:49.507 --> 06:51.608
I've been blackballed.

06:52.844 --> 06:54.712
What is that, like an interracial tea bag

06:54.746 --> 06:55.713
Kind of thing, or...

06:55.747 --> 06:58.248
It's no one will fucking hire me!

06:58.283 --> 06:59.983
Word got around what you did,

07:00.018 --> 07:02.553
And now everyone thinks I'm a troublemaker.

07:02.587 --> 07:04.655
Porn people don't like troublemakers.

07:04.723 --> 07:06.191
They want you to hit your mark

07:06.192 --> 07:07.792
Suck your dick, then go.

07:07.826 --> 07:10.694
Hey. it's gonna be okay. don't cry. don't cry.

07:10.729 --> 07:12.062
We'll -- we'll, you know...

07:12.097 --> 07:14.365
It may not look like much to you,

07:14.399 --> 07:17.568
But I've worked really hard to get where I am.

07:17.602 --> 07:19.970
You don't need to tell me. I saw.

07:20.005 --> 07:21.739
Jesus h., Runkle.

07:21.773 --> 07:23.001
You're supposed to be helping out and shit

07:23.042 --> 07:24.442
Not causing a ruckus.

07:24.509 --> 07:26.243
He ruined my career.

07:26.277 --> 07:27.612
Oh, well, he's good at that.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.913
Usually, his own.

07:29.781 --> 07:32.182
What?! don't be hatin' 'cause I speak the truth.

07:32.217 --> 07:33.951
You're supposed to support me.

07:33.985 --> 07:34.985
And you're supposed to

07:35.053 --> 07:37.021
Masturbate in the privacy of your own home.

07:37.055 --> 07:38.022
What are you, 14?

07:38.056 --> 07:40.091
You can't keep your hands off

07:40.092 --> 07:41.392
your dick for like two minutes?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.627
Come here, daisy.

07:43.661 --> 07:45.229
Buck up, hm?

07:45.263 --> 07:47.197
It's like I told Charlie --

07:47.232 --> 07:51.502
You could either cry like a bitch or smack a bitch.

07:51.536 --> 07:53.303
So smack a bitch.

07:53.338 --> 07:55.606
Don't you think I've been trying?

07:55.674 --> 07:56.674
I know, mon.

07:56.741 --> 07:58.308
Look -- this is on you.

07:58.343 --> 08:01.512
Daisy's family, and you fucked her shit up.

08:01.546 --> 08:04.915
Um, marcy, it's -- it's really starting to burn now.

08:04.949 --> 08:07.017
Oh, okay. one second.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.886
Thank you.

08:09.921 --> 08:11.788
It's like I'm deforesting

08:11.822 --> 08:13.323
The frigging rain forest back there.

08:13.358 --> 08:15.993
I keep expecting tree monkeys to leap out of her bush

08:16.027 --> 08:17.094
And attack me.

08:18.596 --> 08:21.632
Fix this.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.669
Okay, do you smell that gorgeous aroma?

08:26.638 --> 08:28.639
That's what you're looking for.

08:28.707 --> 08:29.740
Wait a minute.

08:29.774 --> 08:32.876
I know you. It's on the tip of my tongue.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.312
Ohh! and funny!

08:35.347 --> 08:38.315
You didn't tell me he was funny.

08:38.350 --> 08:40.851
Chloe metz. how the heck are ya?

08:40.885 --> 08:42.220
A hell of a lot more impressed with Lew

08:42.254 --> 08:44.688
Than I was a couple of hours ago.

08:44.723 --> 08:45.789
Why?!

08:45.824 --> 08:48.292
Well, a few hours ago, you were this big.

08:48.326 --> 08:50.194
And now you're... you're this big.

08:50.261 --> 08:52.196
Oh, oh, oh. hey, watch it, pal!

08:52.230 --> 08:54.066
I don't barf after every show

08:54.067 --> 08:55.467
Just to maintain a size four!

08:56.835 --> 08:59.203
Chloe's assistant is pals with Kenny's cousin.

08:59.237 --> 09:00.771
Well, fuck buddies.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.975
Let's just try to turn the volume down a little bit.

09:06.244 --> 09:09.446
Oh! it just doesn't stop with this guy, does it?

09:09.481 --> 09:12.116
Ohh, Lew told me your sad story.

09:12.150 --> 09:14.451
It's like you're laughing through the pain.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.286
You poor baby. come here.

09:16.321 --> 09:19.890
Yeah, you take a taste of this.

09:19.924 --> 09:21.558
Here. try this.

09:21.593 --> 09:22.893
It's gorgeous!

09:22.927 --> 09:24.194
Oh, my god.

09:25.196 --> 09:26.096
Yeah!

09:26.131 --> 09:28.732
Oh, look. I got to take this.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.801
Uh...play nice.

09:32.437 --> 09:33.704
Aw, he's a sweetheart.

09:33.738 --> 09:35.839
He's a prince among the non-princely.

09:36.908 --> 09:38.876
So...

09:38.910 --> 09:42.379
-Wanna fuck?  -Yes.

09:42.414 --> 09:44.748
Oh! stir my gravy!

09:45.884 --> 09:48.819
Yeah, fuck me with your half-black cock.

09:48.853 --> 09:50.154
Oh, yeah!

09:50.188 --> 09:51.188
Come on.

09:51.222 --> 09:52.322
Oh, get the chocolate!

09:53.458 --> 09:55.025
The chocolate! get the chocolate!

09:55.060 --> 09:56.293
Yeah, get the chocolate.

09:56.361 --> 09:58.062
No, are you deaf?! get the chocolate!

09:58.096 --> 09:59.063
Yeah.

09:59.097 --> 10:01.365
Oh! oh, pour it on me.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.567
Come on. slather it on me.

10:03.601 --> 10:05.736
Make me your little cupcake.

10:07.906 --> 10:09.973
Well, dig in!

10:12.944 --> 10:14.878
Damn! that's damn-good chocolate.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.814
Aw, thanks. I made it myself.

10:16.848 --> 10:19.917
None of that hershey's crap for chloe metz.

10:21.419 --> 10:23.253
Well, come on!

10:23.288 --> 10:24.722
Breed me!

10:24.789 --> 10:27.758
Oh! yeah, make me your bitch!

10:27.792 --> 10:30.060
Fuck me like I'm al-qaeda!

10:30.095 --> 10:31.428
Oh, yeah!

10:31.463 --> 10:32.329
Yes!

10:32.364 --> 10:34.598
Declaring jihad on your pussy.

10:34.632 --> 10:37.735
All right. what I can do to help?

10:37.802 --> 10:39.470
You can be my agent.

10:39.504 --> 10:41.538
Yeah, okay.

10:41.573 --> 10:44.742
You want me to fluff your co-stars while I'm at it?

10:44.776 --> 10:45.943
I'm serious.

10:45.977 --> 10:48.479
If I had a big hollywood guy like you on my team,

10:48.513 --> 10:49.947
They would take me seriously.

10:49.981 --> 10:52.816
Hey, I'm the fucktard who got you kicked off "the slam van"

10:52.851 --> 10:54.151
In the first place.

10:54.219 --> 10:56.487
I don't think those guys are too impressed with my shit.

10:56.521 --> 10:57.488
Fuck "the slam van."

10:57.522 --> 10:59.556
I'm done with that gonzo shit.

10:59.591 --> 11:01.592
I need to move up in the world.

11:01.626 --> 11:04.661
I need to work for the vivids, the digital playgrounds,

11:04.696 --> 11:05.763
Adam & eve.

11:05.797 --> 11:07.464
Is it hard to get those gigs?

11:07.499 --> 11:08.699
Fuck yeah, it's hard.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.501
I've been busting my nuts for weeks

11:10.535 --> 11:13.137
Just trying to get a friggin' meeting with ronny praeger.

11:13.171 --> 11:14.838
He's like the spielberg of porn.

11:14.873 --> 11:16.206
Never heard of him.

11:16.241 --> 11:18.409
You'd like ronny's work -- real artsy.

11:18.443 --> 11:20.778
Dolly shots and crosscutting.

11:20.812 --> 11:23.347
He's doing this adaptation of "chinatown."

11:23.381 --> 11:25.616
Only ronny's calling it "vaginatown."

11:25.650 --> 11:28.452
'cause it's not the water that runs l.a. --

11:28.486 --> 11:30.354
It's the vagina.

11:30.388 --> 11:33.490
And I would be perfect for the sister/daughter.

11:33.525 --> 11:36.527
And I'd get to act. I've always wanted to do that.

11:36.561 --> 11:37.995
-Really? -yeah.

11:38.029 --> 11:40.631
I don't see why emoting and getting stuffed

11:40.665 --> 11:42.700
Have to be mutually exclusive.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.401
So, what's happened so far?

11:44.469 --> 11:47.071
Did you ever get in touch with this ronny guy?

11:47.105 --> 11:49.707
Fucker won't return my phone calls.

11:49.741 --> 11:51.275
I'll tell you what.

11:51.309 --> 11:55.012
I'm gonna call ronny praeger, see what I can do.

11:55.046 --> 11:56.347
For real?

11:56.381 --> 11:57.414
It's what I do.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.616
I get people impossible meetings.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.418
That is so awesome.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.556
And don't worry. I will blow you.

12:05.590 --> 12:07.491
Or did you want my pussy?

12:07.525 --> 12:10.461
You look like you'd want my pussy.

12:10.495 --> 12:12.096
That won't be necessary.

12:12.163 --> 12:14.998
No, we're gonna keep this strictly business.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.568
I do not...want... your pussy.

12:20.839 --> 12:24.475
I could tell you're one of the good ones.

12:35.587 --> 12:37.588
Am I the magician or what?

12:37.622 --> 12:40.357
Man, you're like fucking doug henning.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.959
Only not quite so macho.

12:41.993 --> 12:43.727
Yeah.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.863
Where were you when I was 12, fucker?

12:45.930 --> 12:47.264
Imagine the possibilities.

12:47.298 --> 12:49.299
Instead of whacking off to farrah fawcett,

12:49.367 --> 12:51.502
I could have whacked off on farrah fawcett.

12:52.937 --> 12:53.871
Feeling better?

12:53.905 --> 12:56.306
You get the old lady out of your system?

12:56.341 --> 12:58.142
I don't know if I got it out of my system,

12:58.176 --> 12:59.800
But I discharged precious bodily fluids

12:59.900 --> 13:01.545
all over your spare bedroom there.

13:01.579 --> 13:03.247
Yeah, a little bit of hate-fucking --

13:03.281 --> 13:04.615
Always good for the soul.

13:04.649 --> 13:06.250
Lew!

13:06.284 --> 13:09.720
Ohh! this man is gorgeous!

13:11.456 --> 13:12.389
And this cock.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.825
God, it's gorgeous.

13:14.859 --> 13:17.494
You could wrap it up and sell it at whole foods.

13:17.529 --> 13:18.529
Mm-hmm. yeah.

13:18.563 --> 13:20.297
Okay, so, what's next?!

13:20.331 --> 13:21.598
What do you mean, "next"?

13:21.633 --> 13:23.100
Well, come on, fucker.

13:23.134 --> 13:26.370
I got all night, and I'm ready for a little f-o-n.

13:26.404 --> 13:27.938
F-o-n?

13:27.972 --> 13:30.107
Yeah, "fun," but like a retard said it.

13:30.175 --> 13:31.875
Ohh. oh, you had to be there.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.310
Yet, sadly, I wasn't.

13:33.345 --> 13:36.146
Look, we're gonna have to catch you another time,

13:36.181 --> 13:38.649
Sweet chloe, 'cause, like, I got to hit the troubadour

13:38.717 --> 13:39.983
And hank's coming with.

13:40.018 --> 13:42.786
Ooh, the troubadour. I'm down with that.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.255
No, it ain't gonna happen. no tagalongs.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.523
Why not?

13:46.558 --> 13:48.092
Because the words left my mouth.

13:48.126 --> 13:50.728
Do I look like a person who says things he doesn't mean?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.168
You know, we'll just do it another time, okay?

13:58.203 --> 13:59.603
We'll catch you on the flip side.

13:59.637 --> 14:00.771
But we'll -- we'll do it.

14:00.805 --> 14:03.607
Okay. yeah, good. you've got my number, right?

14:03.641 --> 14:05.309
Well -- chris does.

14:05.343 --> 14:06.710
Chris does. kenny's cousin.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.679
Kenny's...cousin has got the number.

14:08.713 --> 14:10.347
-All right. cool. -cool?

14:10.415 --> 14:11.448
On that note...

14:13.018 --> 14:14.985
So, who's gonna give me a ride?

14:15.020 --> 14:17.454
'cause my b.f.f. dropped me off.

14:17.489 --> 14:20.357
Oh, come on. it'll be fun, guys.

14:29.701 --> 14:31.635
Hey, I'm looking for ronny praeger.

14:31.669 --> 14:33.404
You found him, but I'm late.

14:33.438 --> 14:35.639
Unless you're a money guy. are you a money guy?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.575
No, I'm an agent. I'm her agent.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.444
Then I'm definitely late.

14:40.478 --> 14:43.113
Hey, I called. you said you had time.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.381
Oh, right, right.

14:44.449 --> 14:46.617
You've got some bit of muff that's gonna rock my world.

14:46.651 --> 14:48.752
Daisy.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.190
She ain't right.

14:53.224 --> 14:55.693
Well, hold on. you barely looked at her.

14:55.727 --> 14:56.694
Listen.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.962
Katherine is an innocent.

14:58.997 --> 15:00.864
She doesn't have defenses.

15:02.100 --> 15:05.102
This chick looks like she just blew her landlord for rent.

15:05.136 --> 15:06.270
No offense.

15:06.304 --> 15:08.906
None taken. I just did.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.177
Anyway, I'm off to see cassavetes.

15:13.211 --> 15:14.244
Sorry.

15:16.214 --> 15:18.582
Oh, well. we tried.

15:18.616 --> 15:21.085
What, are you kidding me?

15:21.152 --> 15:23.520
I'm just getting started.

15:25.490 --> 15:28.125
It's up here on the left. right there.

15:28.159 --> 15:30.060
-Wow, that? -yeah.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.097
Your abode has a very "june cleaver" vibe to it.

15:34.332 --> 15:36.967
Ooh! hey, you want to say "hey"

15:37.001 --> 15:38.802
To the beave one more time before I have to go?

15:38.837 --> 15:41.338
Ordinarily, but lew here is on a very tight schedule.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.007
We can't keep the hair bands waiting.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.109
They're very excitable, the hair bands.

15:45.143 --> 15:47.011
You know, so... mm.

15:47.045 --> 15:49.413
It was real, chloe metz.

15:49.447 --> 15:50.514
Real as in real.

15:50.548 --> 15:51.682
Aw, all right. thanks.

15:51.716 --> 15:53.050
It was really, really real.

15:53.084 --> 15:55.085
Hey! none of that, mister!

15:57.055 --> 15:58.956
All righty! okay.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.792
Oh, hey! what are y'all doing tomorrow?

16:01.826 --> 16:04.261
Or -- or friday. you know, either way.

16:04.295 --> 16:06.330
We could hang. what do you think?

16:06.364 --> 16:07.931
I know you did it again!

16:07.966 --> 16:09.700
Who the fuck is that?

16:09.734 --> 16:12.503
-Oh, it's my stupid husband. -you're married?!

16:12.537 --> 16:15.072
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I can't still party!

16:15.106 --> 16:16.407
-No, yes, it does. -what? no!

16:16.441 --> 16:19.043
Hey, come on! come on! drive, bitch! let's go!

16:19.077 --> 16:21.812
What -- where are you going?!

16:23.181 --> 16:24.782
Where are you going?! come back!

16:24.816 --> 16:26.316
That's my wife!

16:26.351 --> 16:27.418
You whore! whore!

16:29.154 --> 16:31.021
Where you been?

16:31.056 --> 16:33.824
Do I look like I shop at the friggin' limited?

16:33.858 --> 16:35.559
I had to borrow this crap.

16:35.593 --> 16:37.828
This is not crap. you look beautiful.

16:37.862 --> 16:38.962
I do?

16:38.997 --> 16:41.965
Yeah, actually, you do.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.400
Hey, hey, hey, ronny.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.202
Fantastic. you followed me here.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.671
Yes. yes, I did, 'cause I'm a man on a mission.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.040
You need to have another look at daisy here.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.342
Hey, don't kill my buzz.

16:51.376 --> 16:53.177
I just toked on a cassavetes joint.

16:53.211 --> 16:55.212
I know how you feel. I love cassavetes.

16:55.246 --> 16:56.213
Sure, you do.

16:56.247 --> 16:57.981
It's why I got into the business, man.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.084
Ben gazzara, "killing of a chinese bookie."

17:00.118 --> 17:01.852
That scene in the car. total darkness.

17:01.886 --> 17:04.320
If I had to choose between a blow job and cassavetes,

17:04.356 --> 17:05.689
I would choose cassavetes.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.191
Mm, I'd take the blow job.

17:07.224 --> 17:08.358
So would i.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.227
But I'd be thinking about cassavetes while I got it.

17:10.261 --> 17:13.262
See, that's why I left all this hollywood crap behind me.

17:13.298 --> 17:14.531
You know?

17:14.566 --> 17:17.134
The shit they make is all about the surface.

17:17.167 --> 17:20.604
Porn is about the real.

17:20.637 --> 17:23.107
"vaginatown" is gonna be my magnum opus.

17:23.141 --> 17:26.609
I want it to have the feel of, uh, "there will be blood."

17:26.644 --> 17:28.612
You know? I'm really into period porn.

17:30.448 --> 17:32.249
Not that kind of period porn.

17:32.283 --> 17:34.551
This is why you have to hire daisy, man.

17:34.586 --> 17:35.619
Look at this girl.

17:35.653 --> 17:37.021
She's katherine.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.423
What, do you think she arrived in l.a. all tarted up?

17:39.491 --> 17:41.191
She's from long island, man.

17:41.259 --> 17:43.627
She ran away from home, pregnant at 16.

17:43.661 --> 17:46.764
Sexually abused, am I right?

17:46.798 --> 17:49.133
She came to l.a. wanting to be an actress, man --

17:49.167 --> 17:50.934
Stars in her eyes, all that shit.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.803
And then you know what happened.

17:52.837 --> 17:54.705
She got crapped on.

17:54.739 --> 17:56.373
Over and over again.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.977
Can you tap into that, daisy?

18:00.011 --> 18:01.278
I don't know.

18:01.312 --> 18:03.313
She can tap into that.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.749
You can tap into that.

18:07.385 --> 18:09.086
It doesn't matter.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.854
The movie's not gonna happen anyway.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.423
The financing just fell through.

18:12.457 --> 18:13.857
You're shitting me!

18:13.892 --> 18:15.559
I wish I was.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.528
The moneymen don't support my vision.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.497
Which I don't understand.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.966
The "wall of cocks" sequence alone...

18:23.001 --> 18:25.169
Would have blown people's minds.

18:25.203 --> 18:28.405
The "wall of cocks"...

18:36.181 --> 18:37.448
I got something for you.

18:37.482 --> 18:40.084
How about I do both you guys, huh? right here.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.852
What do you say?

18:41.886 --> 18:43.387
Too shy for that.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.755
Oh, you're shy?

18:44.789 --> 18:47.558
Then what about watching a little girl-on-girl?

18:47.625 --> 18:49.760
What do you say, sugar? huh?

18:49.794 --> 18:51.895
Do you want me to slap the shit out of you?!

18:51.930 --> 18:54.331
Come here. what the fuck is wrong with you?!

19:00.605 --> 19:03.207
That's it! out of the vehicle!

19:03.241 --> 19:04.942
Yeah, get the fuck out.

19:04.976 --> 19:06.944
What the hell are you doing?!

19:06.978 --> 19:08.312
And you can't cook for shit!

19:08.380 --> 19:10.581
That duck breast was drier than the freakin' mojave,

19:10.615 --> 19:11.982
You goddamn lunatic!

19:12.017 --> 19:14.284
You want to know who the fuck you're dealing with, huh?!

19:14.319 --> 19:16.220
Chloe metz! yeah. that's who.

19:16.254 --> 19:19.423
Number 2 in households on the goddamn cooking channel

19:19.457 --> 19:23.660
In homes all across fucking america, you motherfucker!

19:23.695 --> 19:24.895
-Chloe. -oh, not you, hank.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.132
Is that how you treat a lady?!

19:31.603 --> 19:33.337
What the fuck you doing?

19:33.371 --> 19:36.240
You can't just dump her out here in the middle of the night.

19:36.274 --> 19:38.208
Yeah, she might rape somebody.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.677
Stop the car.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.012
Seriously, sam, stop this penis-mobile this instant.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.313
I'm gonna go back for her.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.448
Why?

19:44.482 --> 19:46.250
Because despite all evidence to the contrary,

19:46.284 --> 19:48.352
I am a gentleman -- you just don't do that shit.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.788
Behind the music."

19:52.090 --> 19:54.825
Whatever, dude. look, I got places to be.

19:54.859 --> 19:57.695
Give sam a call, you need a lift back.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.797
But just you. that schizophrenic cooking whore --

19:59.831 --> 20:02.433
Not getting back in the fucking car, all right?

20:02.467 --> 20:03.467
You.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.950
Hey, baby.

20:19.984 --> 20:22.219
How'd it go? you rock her world?

20:22.253 --> 20:24.688
It went -- it went good, it went good.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.656
Yeah, i, uh...

20:25.690 --> 20:27.791
I-i got daisy the part.

20:27.826 --> 20:31.128
Oh, hells, yeah! you got daisy the part.

20:31.162 --> 20:33.397
'cause that's how charlie runkle rolls.

20:33.431 --> 20:34.431
There's a little hitch.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.166
You know, it's just -- it's a little one.

20:37.268 --> 20:39.336
I, uh, I had -- you know,

20:39.371 --> 20:43.007
I had -- I had to -- I had to invest 50 grand in his movie.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.078
55.

20:50.081 --> 20:51.482
Or, all right, 60.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.218
I had -- I had -- I had to.

20:55.487 --> 20:57.855
I had to invest 100 grand in his movie.

20:57.889 --> 21:02.760
Well, fuck my rusty sheriff's badge.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.630
Okay. i-i'll see you at home.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.174
Things got a little crazy back there, huh?

21:17.208 --> 21:19.977
Just your average, typical, everyday wednesday.

21:21.112 --> 21:23.080
Tuesday.

21:25.417 --> 21:29.453
So, you have a significant other of some kind?

21:29.487 --> 21:31.822
Once upon a time.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.028
Well, you screw like you're trying

21:38.063 --> 21:40.197
To get something out of your system.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.901
Man, if you threw down like that all the time,

21:43.935 --> 21:44.835
You'd be dead.

21:44.869 --> 21:46.503
Or have a very sore pee-pee.

21:50.308 --> 21:51.608
Kids?

21:51.643 --> 21:54.144
What's with the 20 questions?

21:54.179 --> 21:56.780
Uh...they were two questions.

21:56.848 --> 21:57.881
-Right. -so?

21:57.916 --> 22:00.217
Daughter.

22:00.251 --> 22:01.852
And it scares the shit out of me

22:01.886 --> 22:04.088
To think that she might end up like you.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.123
I mean, n-n-no offense,

22:06.157 --> 22:09.860
But, you know, letting some guy order you off the tv

22:09.894 --> 22:11.662
Like you're chinese take-out.

22:11.696 --> 22:13.664
Is that really what it's come to mean

22:13.698 --> 22:15.532
To be a member of the fairer sex

22:15.567 --> 22:17.134
In the city of angels, circa 2008?

22:17.168 --> 22:20.237
For someone as accomplished as you?

22:20.271 --> 22:22.806
You're chloe fuckin' metz.

22:26.544 --> 22:28.979
Ah, fuck if I know.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.950
I'm just glad my kid's a boy.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.518
All right.

22:34.552 --> 22:37.054
That's a good-enough answer.

22:38.423 --> 22:41.392
I would never have guessed that you just gave birth, either.

22:41.426 --> 22:42.893
You are...

22:42.927 --> 22:44.828
How do I put this delicately?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.730
...tight for a new mom.

22:50.568 --> 22:51.802
You know what? hm?

22:51.870 --> 22:54.371
I think that's the sweetest thing anybody's ever said to me.

22:54.439 --> 22:55.773
Well, I'm not just saying it.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.274
You're like a newborn kitten.

22:57.308 --> 22:58.942
Fuckin'-a right I am.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.379
N-not that I've ever fucked a newborn kitten.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.348
Well, I would hope not.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.750
I'm taking an imaginative leap.

23:06.785 --> 23:09.420
I kegel when I cook.

23:09.454 --> 23:12.089
Okay, well, that's reason number 357

23:12.123 --> 23:15.559
To tivo the shit out of "cooking with chloe."

23:18.997 --> 23:21.131
Well, there's mario.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.033
Mm. you gonna be all right?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.001
Yeah.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.969
Yeah, he's a pussycat.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.871
I'd hate to see him when he gets mad.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.049
Hey, baby.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.684
You okay?

23:45.890 --> 23:48.025
Mario, this is hank.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.260
Paisan.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.463
You want a ride?

23:52.497 --> 23:54.198
Uh, no. no, no, no.

23:54.232 --> 23:56.800
You and mario go be together.

24:46.425 --> 24:47.550
Hello

24:51.162 --> 24:52.138

24:54.600 --> 24:55.200

25:20.600 --> 25:22.500

25:22.600 --> 25:25.387
