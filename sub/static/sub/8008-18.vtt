(JAKE BREATHING HEAVILY)

09:44.501 --> 09:46.879
(SCREAMING) No!

09:46.961 --> 09:48.759
Pizza's creepy now!

09:48.838 --> 09:50.511
(CRYING)

09:50.632 --> 09:52.134
You win, all right?

09:52.133 --> 09:53.635
You're mad-creepy!

09:53.635 --> 09:56.514
Do what you will,
you globless, blank-eyed girls!

10:00.975 --> 10:01.976
Uh...

10:02.227 --> 10:03.399
(GASPS) What?

10:07.482 --> 10:08.904
What the butt fuzz?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.369
Contact lenses?

10:11.903 --> 10:13.780
Ha! Baloney.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.742
Nothing but some kids playing a dumb prank!

10:19.410 --> 10:22.163
Man. This whole time,
they were just regular girls.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.665
Where are your parents, huh?

10:23.665 --> 10:26.418
You guys are going to jail! You hear?

10:32.173 --> 10:35.052
So, y'all are bald. Good job.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.928
I'm still calling the cops.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.430
(SQUEAKING)

10:47.313 --> 10:48.405
(POPS)

10:54.070 --> 10:56.038
(BOTH WHIMPERING)

10:56.573 --> 10:59.201
(JAKE SHRIEKING)

11:06.457 --> 11:09.210
What the junk was that?

11:09.586 --> 11:10.963
I think it was...

11:11.462 --> 11:12.805
...beautiful.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.561
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:19.220 --> 11:22.975
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.311 --> 11:28.359
This party is so crazy!
