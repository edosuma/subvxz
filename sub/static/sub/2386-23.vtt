NARRATOR: <i>Kids, when Aunt Lily</i>
<i>went into labor,</i>

00:04.032 --> 00:06.589
<i>Marshall was somewhere</i>
<i>slightly inconvenient,</i>

00:06.592 --> 00:09.260
<i>in Atlantic City</i>
<i>with Uncle Barney,</i>

00:09.262 --> 00:11.929
<i>and drunk to the point of</i>
<i>talking like Yoda.</i>

00:11.931 --> 00:13.847
Baby come...

00:13.849 --> 00:15.499
Papa gonna be am I...

00:15.501 --> 00:17.718
Hospital must we get now...

00:17.720 --> 00:20.471
Okay, there's like a four-hour
wait at the valet stand.

00:20.473 --> 00:23.524
Plus, we're in no shape to
drive. So, a car's out...

00:23.526 --> 00:26.810
Wait, don't worry. We'll take
a cab to the train station.

00:26.812 --> 00:28.295
MAN: Yeah, good luck
getting a cab.

00:28.297 --> 00:29.897
It's impossible because
of the big thing.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.066
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, for the life of</i>
<i>me, I can't remember</i>

00:32.067 --> 00:34.702
<i>what the big thing was in</i>
<i>Atlantic City that weekend.</i>

00:34.704 --> 00:36.971
SON: <i>Was it</i>
<i>a cheerleading convention?</i>

00:38.640 --> 00:41.325
NARRATOR: <i>No, it was</i>
<i>a porn convention.</i>

00:41.327 --> 00:44.311
<i>Sci-fi convention?</i>

00:44.313 --> 00:46.330
<i>Eh, I can't remember.</i>

00:48.950 --> 00:53.420
We're stuck in Atlantic City!
City of Atlantic stuck in are we.

01:06.401 --> 01:08.785
Okay, Lily,
it's going to be fine.

01:08.786 --> 01:12.121
We are not freaking out.
We are not freaking out!

01:12.608 --> 01:15.659
I feel calmer already.
Let's get you to the hospital.

01:15.661 --> 01:17.695
Oh, I can't go yet.
I talked to Dr. Sonya.

01:17.697 --> 01:19.530
They won't admit me
until my contractions

01:19.532 --> 01:20.485
are four minutes apart.

01:20.510 --> 01:22.117
Okay, well, if you
don't make it in time,

01:22.118 --> 01:25.235
I have got you covered. When I
was 13, my father caught me

01:25.237 --> 01:27.504
kissing a boy, so he sent me
to our family's ranch

01:27.506 --> 01:29.840
for foaling season.
Once you see a baby horse

01:29.842 --> 01:32.292
erupt through that birth canal,
you stop even touching yourself.

01:32.294 --> 01:35.078
Anyway, I had skinny arms,
so I got up there elbow deep.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.680
I lost this watch
birthing Blacky...

01:36.682 --> 01:40.267
Okay, stop it. I am not
a farm animal. (mooing)

01:40.269 --> 01:43.253
Oh, there we go.
Easy girl. Sugar cube? (moaning)

01:43.255 --> 01:44.855
Oh, okay.

01:44.857 --> 01:46.757
Ah, don't worry, Lil.

01:46.759 --> 01:49.026
Some of us know what
a woman actually needs

01:49.028 --> 01:50.260
at a time like this.

01:50.262 --> 01:54.431
(panting) A kick-ass
labor announcement e-mail.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.483
TED: <i>A man,</i>

01:56.485 --> 01:57.818
<i>a woman,</i>

01:57.820 --> 01:59.386

01:59.388 --> 02:01.805
<i>embark on an</i>
<i>incredible journey.</i>

02:01.807 --> 02:05.292
<i>Lily's cervix is dilating,</i>
<i>and we want you all</i>

02:05.294 --> 02:07.911
<i>to be part of its</i>
<i>grand opening.</i>

02:07.913 --> 02:10.247
You are not sending that
to anyone, ever.

02:10.249 --> 02:14.218
So what I need right now is
distraction from the pain.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.886
Just tell me a story.

02:15.888 --> 02:17.971
Uh, what story?
I don't care. Anything.

02:17.973 --> 02:19.873
How about the worst
cab ride ever?

02:19.875 --> 02:21.675
HOMELESS GUY:
Clean your window for you? - No!

02:21.677 --> 02:23.093
Hey, get off my cab!

02:23.095 --> 02:25.512
(grunting)

02:25.514 --> 02:27.264
(blows landing)
Oh! Oh, God!

02:27.266 --> 02:29.316
(loud thud)
Oh! Ah!

02:29.318 --> 02:31.435
(Ted and Robin gasping)

02:31.437 --> 02:33.136
(both screaming)

02:33.138 --> 02:34.605
(screaming)

02:34.607 --> 02:36.907
We are not panicking!
We are not panicking!

02:36.909 --> 02:38.975
Get on all fours;
it widens your hind quarters.

02:38.977 --> 02:41.978
Stop it! I am not
a farm animal!

02:41.980 --> 02:44.782
But give me that sugar cube.

02:44.784 --> 02:47.668
Okay, listen, I am going to
get you to that hospital

02:47.670 --> 02:50.337
or die trying.
And if I succeed,

02:50.339 --> 02:52.372
I ask only one thing in return.

02:52.374 --> 02:55.292
Let me choose
your child's middle name.

02:55.294 --> 02:58.045
Because I have thought up the
most awesome name of all time.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.680
What's the middle name?

02:59.682 --> 03:01.331
Wait for it...

03:01.333 --> 03:02.966
I'm waiting.

03:02.968 --> 03:04.184
Wait for it...

03:04.186 --> 03:05.969
I said I'm waiting.

03:05.971 --> 03:08.305
Wait for it.
What's the middle name?

03:08.307 --> 03:10.741
No, the middle name is
"Wait For It."

03:10.743 --> 03:13.227
Let's say his first name is,
oh, I don't know, Barney.

03:13.229 --> 03:17.764
He'd be Barney
"Wait For It" Eriksen.

03:17.766 --> 03:19.967
How awesome is that?

03:21.319 --> 03:22.753
That is...

03:22.755 --> 03:25.706
the coolest...
middle name of all time.

03:25.708 --> 03:27.941
I know!
Okay, listen.

03:27.943 --> 03:30.828
I have a plan
to get us to New York.

03:30.830 --> 03:33.831
All we have to do is get our
hands on that motorcycle.

03:33.833 --> 03:39.520
And I know just the way
to do it.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.173
(both sigh)

03:43.175 --> 03:45.592
(phone rings)

03:45.594 --> 03:46.543
Here.

03:46.545 --> 03:49.179
Oh. Hi, Judy.

03:49.181 --> 03:53.267
Oh, good.
You got the e-mail from Ted.

03:53.269 --> 03:56.770
No, I am not worried my
city hips are too narrow,

03:56.772 --> 03:59.106
and-and your grandson's
going to get stuck.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.657
I got to go.

04:00.659 --> 04:03.193
I thought you deleted
that stupid e-mail.

04:03.195 --> 04:05.395
Okay, I sent it by accident.

04:05.397 --> 04:07.331
She like it?
Yes!

04:07.333 --> 04:09.065
Just keep telling me stories!

04:09.067 --> 04:13.921
Okay, okay, I got one for you:
second base with Neil Young.

04:13.923 --> 04:15.839
Um, (chuckles)

04:15.841 --> 04:20.711
I don't normally go to, um,
second base and tell,

04:20.713 --> 04:25.749
but I just spent
a magical night with Neil Young.

04:25.751 --> 04:27.634
(whispers):
He's still in my room.

04:27.636 --> 04:29.219
Seriously?
Oh, my God.

04:29.221 --> 04:31.021
Be quiet, don't scare him off.

04:31.023 --> 04:32.306
(clears throat)

04:32.308 --> 04:33.757
He-Hey...

04:36.311 --> 04:38.445
Robin...
Yeah.

04:39.397 --> 04:41.231
That's not Neil Young.

04:43.051 --> 04:45.268
Oh, God.

04:45.270 --> 04:46.330
(both laughing)

04:46.355 --> 04:49.157
Oh, we're busting apple bags?
I can bust apple bags.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.284
Ted, remember when we were
dating and we threw that party

04:52.286 --> 04:54.636
and one of those appetizers
just didn't sit right?

04:54.638 --> 04:57.556
Ah... doesn't sound familiar.

04:57.558 --> 05:01.626
I call this story "Ted and
the Cuban Sandwich Crisis."

05:01.628 --> 05:03.328
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

05:03.330 --> 05:05.597
ROBIN: <i>Ted came out of that</i>
<i>bathroom looking like</i>

05:05.599 --> 05:08.600
<i>Joe Frazier after</i>
<i>the Thrilla in Manila.</i>

05:08.602 --> 05:11.987
Oh, what is that smell!?

05:11.989 --> 05:13.906
Ugh!

05:13.908 --> 05:19.111
So I, being a great girlfriend,
<i>tried to help him out.</i>

05:22.782 --> 05:24.700
You guys are all crazy;
I don't smell anything.

05:24.702 --> 05:26.785
Anyway, uh, who wants to
go up on the roof?

05:26.787 --> 05:27.786
ROBIN: <i>But then...</i>

05:27.788 --> 05:31.673
She, who denied it, supplied it.

05:31.675 --> 05:35.438
Yeah, must have been that
Cuban sandwich, huh, babe?

05:35.463 --> 05:37.463
(both chuckle)

05:37.465 --> 05:38.847
That was not cool, Ted.

05:38.849 --> 05:40.182
Contraction!

05:40.184 --> 05:42.301
That wasn't cool, Ted?

05:42.303 --> 05:44.103
(grunting): Just keep going
with the stories.

05:44.105 --> 05:45.854
I don't even care
if I've heard it before.

05:45.856 --> 05:48.690
Just tell me, uh,
"Where Does That Door Go?"

05:48.692 --> 05:49.875
Okay.

05:49.877 --> 05:53.662
Hey, I've never noticed
that door before.

05:55.315 --> 05:57.900
I wonder where it goes.

06:00.987 --> 06:03.188
Ted.
Ted.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.541
No, no, no, let him...
let him...

06:10.046 --> 06:12.347
Wow...

06:16.469 --> 06:18.203
Don't...
No...

06:18.205 --> 06:20.005
Robi....

06:26.229 --> 06:28.897
Oh...

06:28.899 --> 06:30.649
Wow...

06:30.651 --> 06:31.883
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

06:31.885 --> 06:33.318
Dad, oh, good.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.554
Let me guess,
you got Ted's e-mail.

06:35.556 --> 06:38.890
I'm on my way, Princess.
Dad, wait, no, not...

06:38.892 --> 06:40.075
Damn it, Ted.

06:40.077 --> 06:44.279
I was okay with you e-mailing
my aunt, my cousins,

06:44.281 --> 06:46.915
and your cousins, and the guy
that Robin thought was Neil Young.

06:46.917 --> 06:50.869
But my father is the absolute
worst person to have around

06:50.871 --> 06:53.255
in any sort of
medical situation.

06:53.257 --> 06:55.073
LILY:
<i>When I was seven, I needed</i>

06:55.075 --> 06:56.391
<i>to have my tonsils out.</i>

06:56.393 --> 06:58.343
Daddy, I'm scared.

06:58.345 --> 07:02.181
Aw, Princess, I would be too.
I've researched this surgery.

07:02.183 --> 07:05.350
Anything can happen.
You could bleed to death...

07:05.352 --> 07:07.936
...you could have your jaw
removed due to infection,

07:07.938 --> 07:10.922
and the anesthesia could
suddenly just stop working,

07:10.924 --> 07:12.808
much like your mom's
and my marriage.

07:12.810 --> 07:15.727
(laughing)

07:15.729 --> 07:18.930
You do know that we're
getting a divor...

07:18.932 --> 07:21.783
Don't worry about it. We'll talk
about it after the surgery.

07:21.785 --> 07:24.102
Calm down, girl.
(panting)

07:24.104 --> 07:26.705
Okay, for the last time,
I am not...

07:26.707 --> 07:29.541
Actually, keep going.

07:29.543 --> 07:32.578
Okay, I admit the whole "win a
motorcycle plan" was stupid.

07:32.580 --> 07:36.932
Especially because we've been
playing on the wrong machine.

07:38.134 --> 07:39.468

Tonight, we ride!

07:50.264 --> 07:52.064
You won that?

07:52.066 --> 07:54.933
Not exactly. You see, I...

07:54.935 --> 07:56.318
Get off!
(grunting)

08:00.732 --> 08:03.534
I hope Marshall's close.
Cube me.

Tell me a Marshall story.
I miss him.

08:36.457 --> 08:40.544
Got it.
"The Tale of the Cursed Pants."

08:40.546 --> 08:43.547
Hey, guys. (chuckles)

08:43.549 --> 08:46.383
So, I'm starting worry
about these pants.

08:46.385 --> 08:47.434
Starting to?

08:47.436 --> 08:49.302
No, ever since I got them,
terrible things

08:49.304 --> 08:51.221
have been happening to me:
I stubbed my toe,

08:51.223 --> 08:53.506
I missed my train...
You put on the pants.

08:53.508 --> 08:56.509
(all chuckle) And then the lady at the thrift
store said that for years,

08:56.511 --> 08:58.194
no one so much as tried them on.
Can you believe that?

08:58.219 --> 08:59.814
Yes.

08:59.815 --> 09:01.481
You know what this means?

09:01.483 --> 09:04.801
These pants are cursed.

09:06.654 --> 09:08.688
What's this in the pocket?

09:11.159 --> 09:13.293
A clue.

09:13.295 --> 09:15.712
TED: <i>Marshall had</i>
<i>the writing translated.</i>

Dry cleaning, $21.50.

09:43.842 --> 09:46.493
I remember that suit.
He looked like

09:46.495 --> 09:49.329
a little kid's imaginary friend.
(chuckles)

09:49.331 --> 09:51.231
Where is he?!

09:51.233 --> 09:53.316
NARRATOR: <i>Now, Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>knew he had only one chance</i>

09:53.318 --> 09:55.068
<i>of getting out</i>

09:55.070 --> 09:57.370
<i>bribing a cab driver.</i>

09:57.372 --> 09:59.422
Machine that gives money!

AUTOMATED VOICE: Stop
hitting me. Just for that,

you're never getting home
for the birth of your son.

10:32.324 --> 10:34.791

10:41.999 --> 10:45.418
No!!

10:45.420 --> 10:47.053
What's up, bro?

10:47.055 --> 10:49.789
Wait, how did you...
with the security?

10:49.791 --> 10:51.124
I'll explain.

10:51.126 --> 10:53.510

10:53.512 --> 10:56.479
Tell me why we shouldn't
call the authorities...

10:56.481 --> 10:59.566
right now?
Go ahead, call 'em.

10:59.568 --> 11:02.802
But first, can you show me
the rule that says you can't

11:02.804 --> 11:05.488

11:20.038 --> 11:21.621
Two seats just opened up

11:21.623 --> 11:24.657
on his bus to New York!

11:24.659 --> 11:27.294
Barney, you're a genius!

11:27.296 --> 11:28.762
Plus, here's the best part.

11:28.764 --> 11:31.181
This Quinn thing is probably
done, so I'm basically single.

11:31.183 --> 11:34.885
He said the bus is full of
hot college seniors.

11:34.887 --> 11:37.854
Okay, maybe he didn't
say "college."

11:37.856 --> 11:39.472
Or "hot."

11:39.474 --> 11:41.892
I miss Quinn.

12:00.544 --> 12:03.213
Oh, wow.

12:05.249 --> 12:08.084
I don't like this.

12:08.086 --> 12:10.220
(groaning) Okay, okay, that's
four minutes!

12:10.222 --> 12:11.421
We're going to
the hospital.

12:11.423 --> 12:12.889
W-Wait, but Marshall's
not here yet.

12:12.891 --> 12:14.925
I can't go to the hospital

12:14.927 --> 12:16.309

Lily, spread your legs.

12:16.311 --> 12:18.011

Okay. Come
on, come on.

12:23.268 --> 12:24.384
Excuse me, sir.

12:24.386 --> 12:26.403

I can't have an epidural?

12:39.098 --> 12:40.645
You're too far along.

12:40.745 --> 12:43.412

ALL: Boo!
(screams)

20:59.686 --> 21:01.436
NARRATOR:
<i>Which brings us to the story</i>

21:01.438 --> 21:04.089
<i>of a wedding day</i>
<i>that went horribly wrong.</i>

21:05.525 --> 21:07.225
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

21:08.361 --> 21:11.480
<i>Uncle Barney</i>
<i>was getting married.</i>

21:11.482 --> 21:14.533
How the hell did we get there?

21:18.488 --> 21:19.654
I love the name Marvin.

21:19.656 --> 21:20.989
Marv.

21:20.991 --> 21:23.108
Sounds like a little
middle-aged man.

21:23.110 --> 21:23.942
(chuckling)

21:23.944 --> 21:25.043
Golf next
weekend, Marv?

21:25.045 --> 21:26.712
How's that tax report
coming, Marv?

21:26.714 --> 21:28.446
At your age,
erectile dysfunction

21:28.448 --> 21:30.582
is nothing to be
ashamed of, Marv.

21:32.051 --> 21:34.119
<i>It was a beautiful moment.</i>

21:34.121 --> 21:36.471
<i>But then a thought popped</i>
<i>into my head, kids.</i>

21:36.473 --> 21:38.423
The same thought that will pop
<i>into your heads</i>

21:38.425 --> 21:41.476
<i>the first time you see your</i>
<i>best friend holding their baby.</i>

21:41.478 --> 21:43.228
(staple gun clicks)

21:43.230 --> 21:45.480
Wonder how much this would hurt.

21:45.482 --> 21:46.681
(chuckles)

21:47.483 --> 21:48.483
(staple gun clicks)

21:48.485 --> 21:49.851
(screaming)

21:49.853 --> 21:51.953
<i>That guy's a dad.</i>

21:51.955 --> 21:53.688
(screaming)

21:53.690 --> 21:54.906
(baby crying)

21:54.908 --> 21:56.942
Oh, I think he's hungry.

21:56.944 --> 21:59.194
Oh, we'll give
you some privacy.

22:01.147 --> 22:03.331
Wow. Seeing them in there
all together like that,

22:03.333 --> 22:05.250
they're a family,
you know?

22:05.252 --> 22:06.835
That's what I want.

22:06.837 --> 22:09.671
Oh, Ted, I'm glad
we're friends again.

22:09.673 --> 22:10.756
Me, too.

22:10.758 --> 22:13.425
Because as your friend,
I have to tell you:

22:13.427 --> 22:14.593
You're full of crap!

22:14.595 --> 22:16.294
You say you want a family,

22:16.296 --> 22:18.680
you say
you want to meet "The One,"

22:18.682 --> 22:21.633
but you are always chasing
the wrong women.

22:21.635 --> 22:22.851
That is not true.

22:22.853 --> 22:24.186
Look at the women you date,

22:24.188 --> 22:25.520
starting with me:

22:25.522 --> 22:27.656
I told you right away
I didn't want marriage or kids.

22:27.658 --> 22:31.276
Stella had a child with another
man who she still loved.

22:31.278 --> 22:34.963
Zoey was married and trying
to sabotage your career

22:34.965 --> 22:37.199
and wore a lot of stupid hats.

22:37.201 --> 22:39.651
If you really wanted a family,

22:39.653 --> 22:41.653
you would stop pursuing women

22:41.655 --> 22:43.488
you know that
there is no future with.

22:43.490 --> 22:48.210
Okay, first of all,
hats were in that year, kind of.

22:48.212 --> 22:50.495
Secondly, I don't
always choose women

22:50.497 --> 22:53.215
there's no future with, kind of.

22:53.217 --> 22:54.800
Name one exception.

22:54.802 --> 22:57.002
Victoria.

22:57.004 --> 22:59.370
TED: <i>Victoria was great.</i>

22:59.372 --> 23:01.306
Exactly,
and you threw it all away

23:01.308 --> 23:03.592
to chase after some hot piece
of ass. (scoffs)

23:03.594 --> 23:06.061
You mean you?
Thank you!

23:06.063 --> 23:09.231
Victoria is the only
woman you've dated

23:09.233 --> 23:10.632
who could've been "The One."

23:10.634 --> 23:11.900
You should call her.

23:11.902 --> 23:15.386
Tiny thing, last time I saw her,
she was getting engaged.

23:15.388 --> 23:16.538
That was eight months ago.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.073
For all you know,
she's single again.

23:18.075 --> 23:19.074
What if she's married?

23:19.076 --> 23:20.108
What if she's not?

23:20.110 --> 23:21.576
Then you would actually
have a chance

23:21.578 --> 23:24.362
to get what you say you want,
and it terrifies you.

23:24.364 --> 23:27.666
Why? Because if I stole a
scalpel and I cut you open,

23:27.668 --> 23:31.920
all I would find inside is a
scared, trembling pile of crap.

23:31.922 --> 23:34.673
See, I've missed these talks.

23:34.675 --> 23:36.041
Oh, me, too.

23:36.043 --> 23:38.510
Yeah.
Whoa.

23:38.512 --> 23:40.762
What's wrong?
(sighs)

23:40.764 --> 23:42.580
I ruined things with Quinn.

23:42.582 --> 23:44.599
I insisted she stop stripping,

23:44.601 --> 23:46.551
we got in a huge fight about it,

23:46.553 --> 23:49.771
then I ran off to Atlantic City
for two days without calling.

23:49.773 --> 23:52.390
What the hell
am I coming home to?

23:55.862 --> 23:58.930
Let's have an eight-way with
my six hottest stripper friends.

23:58.932 --> 24:01.032
Um, how is that a punishment?

24:01.034 --> 24:02.234
Wait for it.

24:02.236 --> 24:03.618
But I forbid you from filming it

24:03.620 --> 24:04.819
with your overhead camera

24:04.821 --> 24:06.955
that zooms in
on whoever's being the loudest.

24:08.157 --> 24:12.244
Nooooo!

24:12.246 --> 24:14.579
(shudders)
No, that's too cruel.

24:14.581 --> 24:18.567
Or, you know,
maybe Quinn's moved out.

24:19.552 --> 24:22.254
I didn't even think of that!

24:22.256 --> 24:23.972
(sighs)

24:27.793 --> 24:29.144
Hi.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.230
Welcome home.

24:32.232 --> 24:36.184
I decided the place was a bit
too "American Psycho" for me,

24:36.186 --> 24:38.803
so while you were gone,
I hired a decorator

24:38.805 --> 24:39.804
and I asked him,

24:39.806 --> 24:41.072
"What would the inside

24:41.074 --> 24:43.325
of Tinkerbell's vagina
look like?"

24:43.327 --> 24:45.594
And the kid just ran with it!

24:46.779 --> 24:49.281
So... what do you think?

24:49.283 --> 24:52.951
Thank God you're still here!

24:56.488 --> 24:58.673
Welcome home.

25:01.944 --> 25:04.346
NARRATOR: <i>Lily and Marshall asked Robin</i>
<i>to be the photographer</i>

25:04.348 --> 25:06.831
<i>for Baby Marvin's</i>
<i>Birth Announcement card</i>

25:06.833 --> 25:08.633
<i>instead of me.</i>

25:08.635 --> 25:09.634
<i>Whatever.</i>

25:09.636 --> 25:10.969
<i>The only problem?</i>

25:10.971 --> 25:13.088
(camera snapping)

25:18.761 --> 25:20.278
These are terrible, Robin!

25:20.280 --> 25:22.251
Hey, it is not easy
getting a good shot

25:22.276 --> 25:23.899
cooped up in this apartment!

25:23.900 --> 25:25.016
See, two different styles:

25:25.018 --> 25:28.853
I make compositions,
Robin makes excuses.

25:28.855 --> 25:29.854
Click!

25:29.856 --> 25:31.189
Photo burn!

25:31.191 --> 25:33.124
Okay. How about this?

25:33.126 --> 25:35.627
Tomorrow, we go
to Central Park at sunset

25:35.629 --> 25:38.546
and we get the perfect picture
in the perfect setting.

25:38.548 --> 25:40.048
Oh, I like that.

25:40.050 --> 25:42.917
It'll be Marvin's first
outing into the world.

25:42.919 --> 25:44.586
You're gonna love
the park, buddy.

25:44.588 --> 25:46.638
It's a great place
to meet chicks.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.923
Or-or dudes.

25:48.925 --> 25:50.175
Or both.

25:50.177 --> 25:52.560
Oh, we love you
no matter what!

25:52.562 --> 25:56.164
NARRATOR: <i>And kids, as I watched your</i>
<i>Aunt Lily hold her baby boy,</i>

25:56.166 --> 25:58.199
<i>another thought</i>
<i>popped into my head.</i>

25:58.201 --> 26:00.602
Even though you
didn't buy anything,

26:00.604 --> 26:03.021
I want to thank you
for coming in.

26:03.023 --> 26:04.322
Here's a free teddy bear.

26:04.324 --> 26:06.391
What are you gonna
name the little guy?

26:06.393 --> 26:09.494
Six Pack.

26:12.114 --> 26:14.032
Gun it, bitches!

26:14.034 --> 26:14.983
(engine revs)

26:14.985 --> 26:16.785
NARRATOR: <i>That girl's a mom!</i>

26:16.787 --> 26:19.537
(engine revving)

26:20.406 --> 26:21.923
(phone chimes)

26:23.376 --> 26:26.127
Okay, so I met this girl
on the train,

26:26.129 --> 26:28.179
and I texted her, "What's up""

26:28.181 --> 26:31.099
She texted,
"Hey," exclamation point.

26:31.101 --> 26:33.852
Does that mean,
"Ask me out" or "Just..."

26:33.854 --> 26:38.306
Ted, we are responsible for
a whole other human life now,

26:38.308 --> 26:43.261
so new rule: You can't come
to us with any issue unless

26:43.286 --> 26:44.313
it's an "8" or higher.

26:44.314 --> 26:45.647
Got it.

26:45.649 --> 26:48.733
So I'm thinking of texting
back a winky smiley face.

26:48.735 --> 26:50.568
Eight or higher, bro.

26:50.570 --> 26:51.569
Well, no, what should I--

26:51.571 --> 26:52.821
Eight or higher, bro.

26:52.823 --> 26:54.155
No, yeah,
I'm just wondering if--

26:54.157 --> 26:55.907
Eight or higher, bro.

26:55.909 --> 26:57.826
Well, where do you rate this?

26:57.828 --> 27:01.246
This is the same as what's in
little Marvin's pants right now:

27:01.248 --> 27:03.064
a soft two.

27:05.868 --> 27:07.552
Sorry, bro.

27:07.554 --> 27:10.939
Stop texting the bimbo
and call Victoria.

27:10.941 --> 27:12.257
That chapter's over.

27:12.259 --> 27:14.125
W-We just weren't destined
to be together.

27:14.127 --> 27:19.314
"Destined." Aren't you tired
of waiting for destiny, Ted?

27:19.316 --> 27:22.300
Isn't it time
to make your own destiny?

27:23.769 --> 27:25.136
Hey, false alarm.

27:25.138 --> 27:27.939
What I was smelling was
the previous poop,

27:27.941 --> 27:31.014
which, apparently, is
still somewhere on my

27:31.039 --> 27:33.039
clothes and/or in my hair.

27:33.979 --> 27:36.247
Hold him, would you?
Oh. Here.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.702
Ooh.
Yeah, smart.

27:40.704 --> 27:42.320
(shutter clicking)

27:42.322 --> 27:46.908
Oh, sure, that one
turns out great. Ugh.

27:46.910 --> 27:49.761
NARRATOR: And then another thought popped
<i>into my head:</i>

27:49.763 --> 27:52.997
<i>That guy's nowhere</i>
<i>near being a dad.</i>

27:56.886 --> 27:58.836
(line ringing)

27:58.838 --> 28:00.171
VICTORIA: Hello?

28:00.173 --> 28:03.358
Hey, Victoria, it's Ted.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.276
Um, listen, I was just wondering

28:05.278 --> 28:08.513
if you wanted to catch up
sometime; it's been a while.

28:08.515 --> 28:09.814
That sounds nice.

28:09.816 --> 28:12.450
I'm actually around
this afternoon.

28:12.452 --> 28:15.453
Oh, wow, uh, great.

28:15.455 --> 28:17.238
MacLaren's at 2:00?

28:17.240 --> 28:19.040
Is 1:30 okay?

28:19.042 --> 28:20.658
I might have a thing later.

28:20.660 --> 28:23.027
Yeah. Yeah. See you then.

28:23.029 --> 28:24.546
See you then.

28:24.548 --> 28:27.415
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, Barney</i>
<i>and Quinn were off to Hawaii</i>

28:27.417 --> 28:29.534
<i>for their first getaway</i>
<i>as a couple.</i>

28:29.536 --> 28:31.753
Ma'am, I need you
to open your suitcase.

28:31.755 --> 28:33.154
(sighing):
It's mine.

28:33.156 --> 28:35.423
Did you have
to replace my luggage, too?

28:35.425 --> 28:38.726
Run away on me again, you'll
be wearing hot pink stilettos.

28:38.728 --> 28:41.179
What's that?

28:41.181 --> 28:42.230
Yeah, what is that?

28:42.232 --> 28:44.065
It's a magic trick.

28:44.067 --> 28:46.717
You see, I'm something
of a magician.

28:46.719 --> 28:47.718
Open the box, sir.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.104
(laughing):
Oh, I can't do that.

28:50.106 --> 28:52.390
(barking)

28:52.392 --> 28:54.042
Sir, are there drugs
in that box?

28:54.044 --> 28:56.194
Oh, no. He's probably
just barking

28:56.196 --> 28:57.495
because of the explosives.

28:57.497 --> 28:59.831
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

28:59.833 --> 29:01.966
Tell us what's
in the box right now!

29:01.968 --> 29:03.284
I can't.

29:03.286 --> 29:05.687
Magician's Code.

29:06.956 --> 29:10.625
TED: <i>Okay, I need to figure out</i>
<i>if Victoria ever got engaged.</i>

29:10.627 --> 29:14.579
<i>I'll have to very subtly</i>
<i>check for an engagement ring.</i>

29:16.248 --> 29:19.384
<i>Hmm, can't see the left hand.</i>

29:24.663 --> 29:26.125
Open the box now!

29:26.810 --> 29:28.360
I can't.

29:28.362 --> 29:29.611
Magician's Code.

29:29.613 --> 29:32.531
What the hell is
the Magician's Code?!

29:32.533 --> 29:35.050
"A magician never
reveals his tricks."

29:35.052 --> 29:37.035
Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor

29:37.037 --> 29:39.705
from the hallowed
Staten Island Mall Magic Shop,

29:39.707 --> 29:42.074
taught me the importance
of the Code

29:42.076 --> 29:44.242
one fateful autumn
night in 1993.

29:44.244 --> 29:46.118
Always good to tell
a long story while people

29:46.143 --> 29:47.664
are aiming guns at you.

29:47.665 --> 29:50.782
'Twas a night which
would changed my life...

29:50.784 --> 29:53.051
(thudding)

29:53.053 --> 29:55.754
Hello? Mr. Flanagan.

29:55.756 --> 29:58.473
Wh-What are you doing here?

29:58.475 --> 30:01.677
Um...
I'm checking up on you.

30:01.679 --> 30:04.980
Just to make sure
you're practicing your craft

30:04.982 --> 30:06.231
or whatever.

30:06.233 --> 30:08.850
That is an honor, sir.

30:08.852 --> 30:11.486
And yeah, I promise,
I'm practicing.

30:11.488 --> 30:12.854
But wait.

30:12.856 --> 30:14.990
Why were you, why were you
going in my mom's room?

30:14.992 --> 30:18.193
Uh... your mom's actually
helping me with a new trick.

30:18.195 --> 30:19.945
That is so cool!

30:19.947 --> 30:21.146
What is this trick?

30:21.148 --> 30:22.497
Is it sawing a lady in half?

30:22.499 --> 30:23.915
(wry chuckle)

30:23.917 --> 30:25.283
Well, not sawing.

30:25.285 --> 30:26.485
But actually,

30:26.487 --> 30:27.786
the Magician's Code forbids me

30:27.788 --> 30:30.488
from telling you anything else
about the trick.

30:30.490 --> 30:32.958
LORETTA:
Wayne, come back to bed!

30:32.960 --> 30:34.876
Okay, it involves a bed.

30:34.878 --> 30:38.013
W-W-Wait. Can
you at least

30:38.015 --> 30:39.648
tell me the name of this trick?

30:39.650 --> 30:42.000
Sure, kid.

30:42.002 --> 30:43.351
It's called--

30:43.353 --> 30:45.487
The Disappearing Salami.

30:46.505 --> 30:48.590
Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him

30:48.592 --> 30:51.493
before he could ever tell me
what the trick was.

30:51.495 --> 30:52.915
Yeah, that guy was
banging your mom.

30:52.989 --> 30:53.812
Yup.

30:53.814 --> 30:54.946
Totally.

30:54.948 --> 30:57.032
Mr. Flanagan was not ban--

30:57.034 --> 30:59.034
Oh, my God, he was.

30:59.036 --> 31:02.370
Wait, why are you bringing
a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?

31:02.372 --> 31:05.824
I was hoping to shoot up
to Honolulu

31:05.826 --> 31:07.793
for the Worldwide
Magic Convention.

31:07.795 --> 31:09.694
Don't worry. You'll
notice I was gone.

31:09.696 --> 31:11.696
It's only three
14-hour days.

31:11.698 --> 31:13.381
So on our romantic getaway

31:13.383 --> 31:16.134
to help me forget about
you skipping town on me,

31:16.136 --> 31:17.836
you're skipping town on me?!

31:17.838 --> 31:21.372
Look Quinn, you're
very important to me,

31:21.374 --> 31:26.544
but you're sharing my heart
with an equally important Miss.

31:26.546 --> 31:30.482
Miss...

31:30.484 --> 31:32.484
Direction.

31:32.486 --> 31:33.652
What?

31:34.821 --> 31:35.821
H...

31:35.823 --> 31:37.572
Shoot him.

31:37.574 --> 31:40.225
So what did you order?

31:40.227 --> 31:42.611
Oh, just black coffee.

31:42.613 --> 31:43.829
I like it that way, too.

31:43.831 --> 31:45.413
Yeah, it just tastes
better to me.

31:45.415 --> 31:47.199
I find that if the coffee beans
are good enough,

31:47.201 --> 31:49.901
you really don't need--
Why are you in a wedding dress?!

31:49.903 --> 31:53.404
Well, I'm sort of supposed to...

31:53.406 --> 31:56.124
get married today.

31:56.126 --> 31:57.742
All your friends and family
are waiting for you

31:57.744 --> 31:58.927
in some church right now?

31:58.929 --> 32:02.631
Well, not all; we had
five last-minute no-shows.

32:02.633 --> 32:04.082
Well... six.

32:05.301 --> 32:06.885
Mazel tov, Ted.

32:06.887 --> 32:09.387
I was starting to think
this would never happen.

32:09.389 --> 32:10.472
Oh, no, Mrs. Matsen--

32:10.474 --> 32:12.390
MRS. MATSEN: I told
you he wasn't gay.

32:12.392 --> 32:14.092
Wait, what?

32:15.862 --> 32:17.979
I was tempted to leave Klaus
for you last fall.

32:17.981 --> 32:21.316
The only thing holding me back
was the Robin of it all.

32:21.318 --> 32:24.435
I know, and you were right,
but... but that's all over now.

32:24.437 --> 32:27.906
She moved out-- I mean, we're
still friends, but that's over.

32:27.908 --> 32:31.726
All these years, I never stopped
thinking about you, Ted.

32:32.745 --> 32:34.663
I've got a car outside

32:34.665 --> 32:38.300
if you're ready to drive off
into the sunset together.

32:39.669 --> 32:43.004
But if you don't feel
the same way,

32:43.006 --> 32:45.957
if you've closed the door on us,

32:45.959 --> 32:47.676
just say the word...

32:47.678 --> 32:49.227
and I'll go.

32:50.763 --> 32:52.097
Barney, tell them the trick.

32:52.099 --> 32:54.733
The only person I could possibly
reveal the trick to

32:54.735 --> 32:55.767
is another magician.

32:55.769 --> 32:59.304
Well, I'm a magician.

32:59.306 --> 33:01.072
Prove it.

33:07.479 --> 33:08.530
Whoo-hoo!

33:08.532 --> 33:10.715
(gasps)

33:18.040 --> 33:19.341
NARRATOR:
<i>That's Barney's version.</i>

33:19.343 --> 33:21.343
<i>Quinn said it was</i>
<i>a simple card trick.</i>

33:21.345 --> 33:24.012
<i>Who's to say which</i>
<i>version was true?</i>

33:24.014 --> 33:25.847
<i>Quinn's.</i>
<i>Quinn's version was true.</i>

33:27.700 --> 33:29.017
Okay.

33:29.019 --> 33:31.219
I'll tell you.

33:33.289 --> 33:36.024
Oh, that's really cool.

33:36.976 --> 33:38.777
So what's the trick?

33:38.779 --> 33:40.829
I can't say.
Magician's Code.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.681
(gasps):
Ta-da...

33:43.683 --> 33:45.984
da-da-da-da-da-da.

33:45.986 --> 33:47.118
(cell phone ringing)

33:47.904 --> 33:48.904
Hello.

33:48.906 --> 33:51.623
Why did you make me
call Victoria?

33:51.625 --> 33:53.208
She's here in a wedding dress.

33:53.210 --> 33:55.543
I'm the verge of
ruining a wedding!

33:55.545 --> 33:56.912
And Mrs. Madsen's friend
thinks I'm gay,

33:56.914 --> 33:58.496
but let's put a pin
in that till later.

33:58.498 --> 34:00.665
Oh, my God.
Victoria's at the bar with Ted.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.167
That's a seven.

34:02.169 --> 34:03.802
And she's in a wedding dress.

34:04.670 --> 34:05.720
That's a ten.

34:05.722 --> 34:07.889
We got a ten!

34:09.041 --> 34:11.208
What are you gonna do?
Where is she right now?

34:11.210 --> 34:12.677
So this dress, what's the cut?

34:12.679 --> 34:14.763
Are we talking princess,
ball gown, column?

34:14.764 --> 34:18.266
Right, 'cause it's a federal
crime to love weddings.

34:18.268 --> 34:19.768
She's in the bathroom,
which I guess

34:19.770 --> 34:22.487
takes forever with that
giant poufy skirt thing.

34:22.489 --> 34:24.739
Ball gown. Thank you.

34:24.741 --> 34:25.824
Four shots of tequila.

34:25.826 --> 34:27.242
Ted, calm down.

34:27.244 --> 34:29.159
Or not. This is your chance
to get the one who got away.

34:29.161 --> 34:30.695
You want her,
she wants you,

34:30.697 --> 34:32.080
what's the problem?

34:32.081 --> 34:34.666
The problem is Victoria's in
the middle of a giant freak-out.

34:34.668 --> 34:36.734
What if she winds up
regretting this decision?

34:36.735 --> 34:38.753
She's going after Ted Mosby.

34:38.755 --> 34:40.938
That's the best decision
she's ever made.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.757
There you go.

34:47.996 --> 34:50.281
Whoa. What was that?
What?

34:50.283 --> 34:52.684
You said you wanted a picture
of Baby Marvin's first outing.

34:53.552 --> 34:56.187
Our baby's first outing

34:56.188 --> 34:57.422
was to a bar.

34:57.424 --> 34:58.523
(gasps)

34:58.525 --> 35:01.226
I dribble Cuervo
on Marv's soft spot.

35:01.228 --> 35:02.027
Here she comes! Quick!

35:02.029 --> 35:03.428
Oh, yeah.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.762
Eggshell or cream?

35:04.764 --> 35:06.948
Is it eggshell or cream?

35:08.434 --> 35:09.401
So.

35:09.403 --> 35:12.988
You... me...
riding off into the sunset.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.772
Any thoughts?

35:15.607 --> 35:17.058
One question:

35:17.960 --> 35:19.294
FDR or Westside Highway,

35:19.296 --> 35:21.046
what's the quickest
way to the sunset?

35:24.700 --> 35:27.802
Man, I wind up in
these rooms a lot.

35:27.804 --> 35:30.722
If we miss Hawaii because of
this, guess who's not doing

35:30.724 --> 35:32.957
The Disappearing Salami
anytime soon?

35:33.792 --> 35:36.728
I need to ask you both
a few questions.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.129
Let's start with you.

35:38.131 --> 35:39.130
Name?

35:39.132 --> 35:40.398
Quinn Garvey.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.483
Occupation?

35:41.485 --> 35:43.101
Unemployed.

35:43.103 --> 35:44.436
Well, well, well.

35:44.438 --> 35:45.737
Look who's keeping secrets now.

35:45.739 --> 35:48.189
Sir, I'll tell you her
occupation: stripper.

35:48.191 --> 35:49.824
She insists she's proud of it,

35:49.826 --> 35:52.310
but apparently not
proud enough to tell you.

35:52.312 --> 35:55.914
Barney, I was going to surprise
you with this on our trip,

35:55.916 --> 35:58.433
but... I quit.

36:00.319 --> 36:02.587
You... did that for me?

36:02.589 --> 36:04.072
Yes.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.458
And now that you know
what I did for you,

36:06.460 --> 36:08.593
and how much I care for you,

36:08.595 --> 36:11.429
would you please
show him the trick?

36:15.834 --> 36:19.120
Sorry. Magician's Code.

36:23.342 --> 36:25.343
Where should we go?

36:25.345 --> 36:26.844
Your place?

36:26.846 --> 36:28.012
My place?

36:28.014 --> 36:29.347
We could go on my honeymoon.

36:29.349 --> 36:30.848
(laughs)

36:30.850 --> 36:31.849
Just kidding.

36:31.851 --> 36:33.935
Although, it is paid for.

36:35.738 --> 36:37.705
I know where we should go.
Where?

36:37.707 --> 36:39.491
Your wedding.

36:39.493 --> 36:40.692
I'm taking you back.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.789
I don't understand.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.090
I thought you wanted this.

36:52.092 --> 36:53.458
I do want this.

36:53.460 --> 36:56.311
I've thought about you
so many times.

36:56.313 --> 36:58.897
What might have been...

36:58.899 --> 37:01.966
But I got left at the altar,
and it nearly killed me.

37:03.436 --> 37:04.770
You're someone's fiancé,

37:04.772 --> 37:06.605
and I have to respect that.

37:07.657 --> 37:09.274
So let's hit a motel,
jam in a quickie,

37:09.276 --> 37:10.308
and get you back
to your wedding.

37:10.310 --> 37:11.360
(giggles)

37:11.362 --> 37:13.578
It's the right thing to do.

37:14.497 --> 37:16.531
Some part of me
needed to hear you say

37:16.533 --> 37:18.500
that running away together
wasn't an option.

37:18.502 --> 37:21.036
And now that I know that...

37:21.038 --> 37:23.255
it's like I'm sobering up.

37:26.259 --> 37:27.376
Is there any way

37:27.378 --> 37:29.928
that we can just pretend
this never happened?

37:31.764 --> 37:33.231
This never happened.

37:38.554 --> 37:41.340
Mr. Flanagan wasn't
banging my mom.

37:42.341 --> 37:44.342
Well.

37:44.344 --> 37:46.144
Your flight left.

37:46.146 --> 37:49.481
We need to hold Mr. Stinson
for further questioning.

37:49.483 --> 37:51.015
But you're free to go.

37:54.037 --> 37:55.754
Maybe I should.

37:56.622 --> 37:59.241
Wait!

38:00.159 --> 38:01.493
I'll show you the trick.

38:05.965 --> 38:08.366
Sir!

38:08.368 --> 38:10.001
May I please have
the silk handkerchief

38:10.003 --> 38:11.336
in your top left breast pocket?

38:11.338 --> 38:13.505
Well... I don't have...

38:15.040 --> 38:17.059
(chuckles)

38:17.061 --> 38:18.260
(clears throat)

38:25.852 --> 38:30.221
Sim salabi ma...
sim salabi ma...

38:31.991 --> 38:32.991
(gasps)

38:32.993 --> 38:34.493
Relax, relax,
it's part of the trick.

38:34.495 --> 38:36.244
How did you get that
through the X-Ray machine?

38:36.246 --> 38:38.029
No questions from
the audience, please!

38:40.867 --> 38:44.369
(chanting nonsense syllables)

38:51.878 --> 38:52.844
What is that?

38:52.846 --> 38:54.012
Madam, may I please have

38:54.014 --> 38:55.914
the key on your necklace?

38:56.682 --> 38:57.682
Oh!

38:57.684 --> 38:58.884
(giggles)

39:03.523 --> 39:04.973
(beeping)

39:04.975 --> 39:06.391
Is that gonna explode?

39:06.393 --> 39:07.759
What?

39:07.761 --> 39:09.778
(screams)

39:09.780 --> 39:11.780
(coughing)

39:11.782 --> 39:13.315
Ahem.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.534
(mock gasps)

39:15.536 --> 39:17.819
What?

39:42.228 --> 39:44.629
(loudly):
Will you marry me?

39:46.399 --> 39:47.566
Yes.

39:51.237 --> 39:53.238
(laughing)

39:53.240 --> 39:54.773
Come on, guys.

39:54.775 --> 39:57.726
We're losing the light
for Baby's Second First Outing.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.755
NARRATOR: <i>I hate to say it,</i>
<i>but Robin nailed it.</i>

40:10.757 --> 40:12.958
(door closes)

40:13.993 --> 40:16.327
Hey.
Guys, we've got something to tell you.

40:16.329 --> 40:18.046
Eight or higher, bro.

40:18.048 --> 40:19.548
We're engaged.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.300
That's a... that's a ten.

40:22.302 --> 40:24.302
We got another ten!

40:24.304 --> 40:25.971
Oh...
Wow, big day!

40:25.973 --> 40:28.390
Congratulations!
Thank you.

40:28.392 --> 40:30.174
How did this happen?

40:30.176 --> 40:32.394
Oh... magic.

40:33.679 --> 40:34.896
Oh.

40:34.898 --> 40:36.281
Uh, not to ruin the moment,

40:36.283 --> 40:39.568
but apparently little Marvin
is quite stunned by the news.

40:39.570 --> 40:42.037
Well...

40:42.039 --> 40:43.371
Yeah. Wow.
Yeah.

40:43.373 --> 40:45.540
Do you guys mind
recounting this romantic tale

40:45.542 --> 40:46.958
next to a Diaper Genie?

40:46.960 --> 40:52.030
Oh, Marvin, you're about to
hear your first love story!

40:52.032 --> 40:53.364
QUINN:
Once up on a time,

40:53.366 --> 40:56.585
this creepy magic dude
was boning Barney's mom...

41:02.258 --> 41:03.925
It's our last chance
to run away together.

41:03.927 --> 41:04.976
Door's right there.

41:04.978 --> 41:06.595
Yes, we'll start a new life.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.063
Head for the border!
Canada!

41:08.065 --> 41:10.015
Eh, Mexico.
Canada sucks.

41:10.017 --> 41:11.816
Okay, well,
you're one-quarter Canadian,

41:11.818 --> 41:13.652
so by that logic
you one-quarter suck.

41:13.654 --> 41:15.020
I'm 100% awesome

41:15.022 --> 41:16.521
and you know it.
