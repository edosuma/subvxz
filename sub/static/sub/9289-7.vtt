00:14.496 --> 00:17.616
- Reza's parents are here.
- Where is Reza?

00:17.707 --> 00:19.747
Men from the government are talking to him.

00:19.835 --> 00:22.326
Who wired that money
into Syed Ali's accounts?

00:22.420 --> 00:26.169
Bob Warner, Marie's father.

00:26.258 --> 00:28.416
Come with me, please.

00:28.510 --> 00:31.083
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

00:31.179 --> 00:33.753
How did you get in here
without my authorisation?

00:33.849 --> 00:36.803
- I need to talk to you.
- You're not my wife any more.

00:36.893 --> 00:39.764
- It's not about us.
- Then what?

00:39.855 --> 00:43.437
There are members of your own
administration allying against you.

00:43.525 --> 00:45.648
That's why I came here today.

00:45.735 --> 00:48.939
I need to get you out of here
because I want you to be safe.

00:49.030 --> 00:50.525
- OK.
- Come on.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.822
Your daughter's not with
any of the departments.

00:52.909 --> 00:55.614
Then where the hell is she?

00:55.704 --> 00:57.862
Give her to me, Kim.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.867
We need to get out of here.

01:02.961 --> 01:05.084
Get his car keys.

01:05.172 --> 01:07.045
Nina killed your wife.

01:07.132 --> 01:12.209
My goal is the same as yours, to stop
this bomb. Who is the man in Visalia?

01:12.304 --> 01:16.930
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen. He's
the only one who knows where the bomb is.

01:17.017 --> 01:21.394
The team's assembled in Visalia.
We'll have tactical and field units. Jack...

01:21.480 --> 01:24.267
It's all right. It's all right.
Just take it easy.

01:38.371 --> 01:42.832
Pull up 30 feet from the left wing.
Escort, lay back.

02:01.228 --> 02:03.304
Move.

02:06.108 --> 02:09.939
Jack drugged Miller
to get me alone. Tell Mason.

02:10.904 --> 02:12.731
- Is he in the van?
- Yeah.

02:12.823 --> 02:16.274
He's gonna come to in 20 minutes.
He'll have a headache.

02:16.368 --> 02:18.823
Here's command authority.

02:18.912 --> 02:22.198
- I owe you, Doug. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:25.293 --> 02:27.963
Get in the plane.

02:48.775 --> 02:51.776
Agent Bauer. Rick Phillips, FBI.

02:52.612 --> 02:55.447
Harris and I will be
your transit team to Visalia.

02:55.532 --> 02:58.901
We'll act as reinforcements
once we're on the ground.

02:58.994 --> 03:03.205
So, we're clear here, Jack?
I know what you did to Ed Miller.

03:03.290 --> 03:07.370
Rick, right? Do yourself a favour.
Stay out of this.

03:07.461 --> 03:09.583
Do your job, get us to Visalia.

03:10.338 --> 03:14.550
My job is to make sure this runs smoothly.
That means keeping her safe.

03:16.970 --> 03:19.591
Consider me your new chaperone.

03:22.809 --> 03:27.139
I need two lines set up through CTU.
One for mobile, one for the translator.

03:27.230 --> 03:30.148
It'll be tricky cos their
phone lines are sketchy.

03:30.233 --> 03:32.309
It's already done.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.565
Good.

03:57.969 --> 04:02.596
Way to go, Kate.
You broke his parents' hearts, too.

04:02.682 --> 04:06.846
I'm so sorry, Marie. But I don't know
what these government people found.

04:06.937 --> 04:10.187
And believe me, I wish they
hadn't have found anything.

04:10.273 --> 04:14.318
But aren't you curious?
Why are they asking Dad questions now?

04:14.402 --> 04:16.728
You started a witch-hunt in our family.

04:16.822 --> 04:20.866
No, Marie. It's because Reza
is connected to some bad people.

04:20.951 --> 04:24.450
- Maybe even terrorists.
- You're out of your mind.

04:24.538 --> 04:29.365
We're not gonna put our heads in the sand,
Marie. Or this could end up hurting Dad.

04:29.459 --> 04:32.129
We're not gonna let that happen.

04:33.255 --> 04:34.832
Come with me.

04:34.923 --> 04:37.794
What did you tell them?
What did you accuse my father of?

04:37.884 --> 04:40.802
I didn't accuse him of anything.
It's his company.

04:40.887 --> 04:44.256
You're pointing your finger
at him to cover yourself!

04:44.349 --> 04:45.891
- Kate!
- Stay out of this.

04:45.976 --> 04:48.893
You don't talk to her like that.
You listen to me.

04:48.979 --> 04:52.063
I have done more for your father
than you will ever know.

04:52.149 --> 04:57.060
And all I've ever gotten from you
is suspicion and resentment. I'm sick of it.

04:57.154 --> 04:59.479
I didn't connect you to a terrorist.

04:59.573 --> 05:02.490
No? Then who did?
I don't know any terrorists!

05:02.576 --> 05:05.446
All I know is you paid for someone
to dig up dirt on me.

05:05.537 --> 05:06.782
Apparently, he did.

05:06.872 --> 05:10.572
No, he didn't, because all he found
out was stuff about Bob, not me.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.336
So if anybody's guilty, it is your father.

05:13.420 --> 05:18.794
- Don't you make this about my father.
- Stop it. Stop, Kate! Both of you, stop it!

05:27.476 --> 05:29.634
Nice work, Kate.

05:35.150 --> 05:37.024
Call me when you get that.

05:37.110 --> 05:40.230
- I'll have it today. Four o'clock too late?
- No.

05:40.322 --> 05:44.154
- I'll talk to you then.
- Yeah, good. Alrighty. Bye-bye.

05:45.827 --> 05:49.907
If it isn't the Chief of Staff himself.
Mike!

05:49.998 --> 05:52.240
Sherry.

05:53.418 --> 05:56.253
You look beautiful... as always.

05:56.338 --> 05:59.339
What are you doing here?
Did David ask you to come here?

05:59.424 --> 06:03.671
No. I just showed up on my own.

06:04.638 --> 06:07.176
So, how have you been?

06:07.933 --> 06:10.056
- Fine, Mike. Just fine.
- Yeah?

06:10.143 --> 06:15.897
Yeah. You know, it's been a challenging
year. But what is it they say?

06:15.982 --> 06:22.151
We... learn from our mistakes
and grow from our misfortunes.

06:22.864 --> 06:25.320
Have you told that to David?

06:25.408 --> 06:27.816
No.

06:27.911 --> 06:32.573
I don't think he's ready
to hear that yet. Not now.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.500
But he is waiting for you,
so why don't you just go on in?

06:37.587 --> 06:40.505
I'll see you later... I'm sure.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.543
Here you go, sir.

06:46.972 --> 06:50.804
Don't speculate, don't say anything.
We don't know where he is.

06:50.892 --> 06:53.383
- That is our position.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:53.478 --> 06:56.598
- All right, good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:57.858 --> 07:00.728
Sir, we have to talk about Ron Wieland.

07:00.819 --> 07:04.069
What about him? Does anybody
know we have him sequestered?

07:04.156 --> 07:09.446
No, but Jenny got a call from his production
crew. They haven't seen him in four hours.

07:09.536 --> 07:12.703
They'll figure out the last person
they saw him with was you.

07:12.789 --> 07:14.865
Then leak a story.

07:14.958 --> 07:17.081
Mike. Good to see you.

07:17.169 --> 07:19.742
I got here as soon as I could. Hi, Lynne.

07:19.838 --> 07:21.380
Mike.

07:24.092 --> 07:27.461
Armus brought me up to speed
on the Wieland situation.

07:27.554 --> 07:31.718
I did some research, found out there
is precedent for the executive branch

07:31.808 --> 07:37.147
taking action against the press
at times of national crisis.

07:38.023 --> 07:41.107
So, when you say leak a story,
what kind of a story?

07:41.193 --> 07:45.985
Make it appear as though Wieland
went to Portland on a personal matter.

07:46.072 --> 07:50.569
Armus can arrange that. It's a band-aid,
but it'll get us through the day.

07:53.580 --> 07:56.616
- Talk to Armus. Put it in motion.
- Yes, sir.

08:01.838 --> 08:05.005
- I saw Sherry on my way in.
- Oh.

08:05.091 --> 08:09.338
- Should I attach any significance to that?
- It was her decision to come here.

08:09.429 --> 08:15.135
That's what she said. But I have to tell you,
I'm surprised you're allowing her to stay.

08:16.311 --> 08:21.139
For the time being, Mike.
Just for the time being.

08:21.233 --> 08:25.729
Let's go to the OC. I'll bring you
up to speed. There's a lot to cover.

08:27.614 --> 08:31.446
- You wanna send that on to Division?
- Yes, sir.

08:33.537 --> 08:35.114
- Mr Mason?
- Yeah?

08:35.205 --> 08:39.452
- I just got off the phone with Ed Miller.
- How's it going between Jack and Nina?

08:39.543 --> 08:43.955
He doesn't know. Jack drugged him
and got on the plane without him.

08:44.047 --> 08:46.206
Please tell me you're kidding.

08:46.299 --> 08:49.004
Sloane's bringing Ed back now.
What should I do?

08:49.094 --> 08:52.379
They're on a plane.
There's nothing anybody can do.

08:52.472 --> 08:56.221
Except hope that his impulse for revenge
doesn't cloud his judgment.

08:56.309 --> 09:01.102
- You mean like drugging one of our agents?
- What can I say? The guy's a little crazy.

09:01.189 --> 09:05.685
That's why I didn't want him here
in the first place, but... he gets results.

09:06.236 --> 09:09.985
And we need some
pretty big results here, so...

09:30.886 --> 09:34.005
Just because Sherry tells you that
there's a conspiracy against you,

09:34.097 --> 09:36.588
that doesn't make it true.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.981
But if it is true, it will affect every
aspect of our response to this bomb.

09:45.066 --> 09:48.233
Sherry was right about
the military evacuation of LA.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.692
That's specific information.

09:50.781 --> 09:55.193
She still has well-routed sources.
But a conspiracy?

09:55.285 --> 09:59.365
Don't forget where she's coming from.
She may have her own agenda.

09:59.456 --> 10:04.201
I'm well aware of that, Mike. She's on
a tight leash. I wanna find her source.

10:06.296 --> 10:10.045
Let me look into this
so-called cabal against you.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.838
If there's any substance to it,
I'll uncover it.

10:12.928 --> 10:17.839
Right now, the country needs
your attention on the situation in LA.

10:21.561 --> 10:24.646
Start with Stanton.

10:24.731 --> 10:27.269
Stanton?

10:27.359 --> 10:32.187
The head of NSA, conspiring against
the president of the United States?

10:32.280 --> 10:37.073
Aside from the implications if that were
true, hasn't he always been an ally to you?

10:37.160 --> 10:41.407
Yes. But he's also Eric Rayburn's boss.

10:41.498 --> 10:45.330
It's not inconceivable Rayburn
could be doing Stanton's bidding.

10:45.418 --> 10:49.962
- They have always been on the same page.
- That's not enough to indict Roger.

10:50.048 --> 10:56.300
I know. That's why I want you to check him
out. I'm hoping you can prove me wrong.

11:00.851 --> 11:06.189
I'll talk to Roger as soon as I settle in,
see if I can get a read on him.

11:06.273 --> 11:08.349
Thanks, Mike.

11:19.286 --> 11:22.405
- How long until we land?
- About ten minutes.

11:29.963 --> 11:34.708
- How far is Faheen from the airport?
- I'll tell you when we land.

11:34.801 --> 11:40.341
We are fighting the clock, so you better start
talking. How far is Faheen from the airport?

11:40.432 --> 11:45.639
We need her to cooperate, Jack.
Threatening her isn't gonna help.

11:48.982 --> 11:50.809
Fine.

11:50.901 --> 11:55.230
Get her changed.
I need her to look like a civilian.

12:00.494 --> 12:02.570
Come on, let's go.

12:03.497 --> 12:05.869
No.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.745
Here. She doesn't leave my sight.

12:55.257 --> 12:58.174
Everything's working out, right?

12:58.260 --> 13:02.209
Why don't you come by? It's not
the Ritz-Carlton but it works for us.

13:02.305 --> 13:04.761
- OK, I'll come on down.
- I gotta go.

13:06.893 --> 13:10.227
- Yeah?
- Jack's about to land in Visalia.

13:10.313 --> 13:13.896
- Have they got a location for Faheen?
- No. Not until they land.

13:13.984 --> 13:17.566
- Stay on it. I'll be down in a minute.
- Right.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.909
Double espresso au lait, and it's hot.

13:35.922 --> 13:40.086
Out of three. And five cents is your change.

13:41.511 --> 13:43.053
Hello?

13:43.138 --> 13:45.843
John, it's your father.

13:47.559 --> 13:51.426
- Hello? You there?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

13:52.397 --> 13:55.683
Look, I... I know it's been a while.

13:55.776 --> 13:58.231
- Two years.
- That long?

13:58.320 --> 14:01.653
- Yeah.
- That's my fault.

14:04.618 --> 14:06.860
John, I'd really like to see you today.

14:06.953 --> 14:09.824
- I can't.
- It's important.

14:09.915 --> 14:14.043
Dad, listen, you can't just call me
out of the blue and expect me to jump.

14:14.127 --> 14:17.745
I don't really want to see you,
and even if I did, I can't. I'm busy.

14:17.839 --> 14:21.504
I know I screwed up. I understand
if I'm not your favourite person.

14:21.593 --> 14:26.469
But can you do this one thing for me?
Come to CTU. You know where that is, right?

14:26.556 --> 14:29.806
I can't do it today, Dad.
I'm in the middle of something.

14:29.893 --> 14:33.642
- Tell me what's going on.
- I need to see you, that's what's going on.

14:33.730 --> 14:38.772
You're not listening to me, Dad. I'm gonna
have to call you when I have a chance.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.876
Get up.

15:30.704 --> 15:32.780
Let's go.

15:41.548 --> 15:44.715
- I'm Agent Dockerty.
- Jack Bauer. Phillips and Harris.

15:44.801 --> 15:48.087
We're all set up.
All we need now is a location.

15:48.180 --> 15:51.964
Where we going, Nina? What's the location?

15:52.058 --> 15:54.846
- A thrift store on North Collins.
- The name?

15:54.936 --> 15:57.854
- Crescent Collectibles.
- Our transportation?

15:57.939 --> 16:01.522
Three teams, three vehicles.
They're waiting for your orders.

16:01.610 --> 16:05.654
Crescent Collectibles is in
the De Anza district. That's not too far.

16:05.739 --> 16:09.689
- We can set up base camp here.
- Do it. Take her.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.705
- What you wanna do with her?
- She stays with me.

16:13.789 --> 16:17.122
Why? Keep her here
and my guys will watch her.

16:17.209 --> 16:19.664
- I'm gonna use her.
- Use her how?

16:19.753 --> 16:21.330
You'll see.

16:24.674 --> 16:27.878
- All right, everyone. Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:27.969 --> 16:32.347
- Roger.
- Mike. I heard you were here.

16:32.432 --> 16:36.726
I understand the president handed
Eric Rayburn his walking papers.

16:36.812 --> 16:40.940
Eric messed up.
The president was right to dismiss him.

16:41.024 --> 16:47.062
Still, he fired someone you appointed.
It takes character to support that.

16:49.533 --> 16:53.447
I got a nasty workload today.
You have to excuse me.

16:53.537 --> 16:57.700
Actually, the president wants me
to insert myself into your day.

16:57.791 --> 17:01.374
That might be difficult.
I'm moving a mile a minute here.

17:01.461 --> 17:06.372
I understand. I'd like to look at any paper
you have on the most active leads.

17:06.465 --> 17:09.171
Let me play catch-up.

17:09.261 --> 17:13.804
All right. We can use a little help
in the civil response area.

17:13.890 --> 17:17.674
Great. I'll be working up here in four.
Get me what you got.

17:32.159 --> 17:36.536
- Update me.
- CTU Los Angeles is yielding good leads.

17:36.621 --> 17:42.042
They raided a warehouse within city limits
and found weapons-grade nuclear material.

17:42.127 --> 17:46.077
Langley is using satellite playback
to determine who was there.

17:46.173 --> 17:48.711
- A suspect was killed?
- There was a shoot-out.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.216
Division's having a hard time
ID'ing the body.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.418
What's this?

17:53.513 --> 17:57.048
Jack Bauer is still involved
in the investigation.

17:57.142 --> 18:00.226
I thought he was dismissed
after his assignment.

18:00.312 --> 18:03.313
He's heading the team
that's tracking Mamud Faheen.

18:03.398 --> 18:08.440
And Nina Myers, the woman you granted
immunity to, she's helping them.

18:10.781 --> 18:13.318
Bauer and Nina Myers
are working together?

18:13.408 --> 18:17.358
Yes, sir. I believe he volunteered.

18:20.165 --> 18:24.661
- What's the time divisibility?
- From the time we break in, 30 seconds.

18:24.753 --> 18:28.204
- What about the roof?
- We're looking to see if it's viable.

18:28.298 --> 18:31.382
It's not. He'll have sensors on the wall.

18:31.468 --> 18:34.385
You go through the front door,
Faheen'll commit suicide.

18:34.471 --> 18:37.176
If he's so willing to die,
why'd he leave LA?

18:37.265 --> 18:41.049
He doesn't want to be collateral damage,
but he'll die to protect the plan.

18:41.144 --> 18:43.766
We can't take a chance.
We need this guy alive.

18:43.855 --> 18:47.687
- Gas canister?
- He knows our protocols, and he's prepared.

18:47.776 --> 18:51.690
- How does he know your protocols?
- She gave them to him.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.271
It doesn't matter. Nina, you're going in.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.157
- What?
- He knows you.

18:56.243 --> 18:59.861
- He also thinks I'm in prison.
- Make him believe you got out.

18:59.955 --> 19:02.872
The day his bomb's going off?
He'll know I'm lying.

19:02.958 --> 19:07.703
You're a good liar. The only way he's gonna
know is if you let him. We need 30 seconds.

19:07.796 --> 19:13.550
He will put a bullet in my head before I say
hello, and then he'll turn the gun on himself.

19:13.635 --> 19:17.964
We'll make sure he doesn't
turn the gun on himself.

19:33.989 --> 19:37.571
- How's it looking?
- Good. We're just waiting for the feeds.

19:37.659 --> 19:40.115
Do we know what dialect Faheen speaks?

19:40.203 --> 19:45.446
- Yeah. Nina gave us the information.
- Mr Mason? Tony Almeida's on the line.

19:51.506 --> 19:54.756
- Yeah, Tony.
- Naiyeer's starting to talk.

19:54.843 --> 19:58.128
He says Bob Warner is the one
that had dealings with Syed Ali.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.547
Warner claims he doesn't know anything.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.341
Bring them both in.
We'll separate them and turn up the heat.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.761
Are you giving me the OK to arrest them?

20:06.855 --> 20:10.900
- If they don't come willingly, yes.
- On what charge?

20:10.984 --> 20:14.068
I don't care if it's jaywalking,
just bring 'em in.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.987
OK. You got it.

20:24.664 --> 20:28.247
- What's going on with my father?
- Give me a minute, please.

20:31.838 --> 20:35.207
I need you to get Bob Warner.
We're gonna finish this up at CTU.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.921
Got it.

20:38.011 --> 20:40.502
Reza, I'm gonna need you to come with us.

20:40.597 --> 20:43.883
- Come with you where?
- Back to CTU.

20:43.975 --> 20:46.015
- For what?
- Further questioning.

20:46.103 --> 20:48.854
I'm not going with you anywhere.

20:48.939 --> 20:54.479
Look, I'm not arresting anybody... yet.
But I will if you force me to.

20:54.569 --> 20:59.362
Now, you're coming with us either way.
How we do this is entirely up to you.

20:59.449 --> 21:01.940
Do what the man says. Don't argue with him.

21:02.035 --> 21:05.155
- Bob, I haven't done anything wrong.
- Reza.

21:05.247 --> 21:07.572
Reza, please, do this for me.

21:11.002 --> 21:12.461
OK?

21:16.633 --> 21:19.919
- Then I'm coming with you.
- We can't take you with us.

21:20.011 --> 21:23.297
Then I'll follow you.
You've ruined my wedding day.

21:23.390 --> 21:27.090
I'm not gonna let you separate me
from my fiancé.

21:30.397 --> 21:32.473
Right this way.

21:39.906 --> 21:41.282
Dad?

21:41.366 --> 21:44.652
Call everyone, explain
the wedding's been postponed.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.778
I want you to call Larry.
Tell him where I am.

21:47.873 --> 21:51.206
- Dad, Larry's a tax attorney.
- It doesn't matter.

21:51.293 --> 21:53.831
It doesn't matter. He'll know what do.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.996
- OK?
- All right.

22:15.734 --> 22:17.014
Good afternoon.

22:17.110 --> 22:21.938
You two haven't been formally introduced.
Lynne Kresge, Sherry Palmer.

22:22.032 --> 22:24.986
Lynne. It's lovely to meet you.

22:25.076 --> 22:30.996
Mrs Palmer. Mr President, there were
a few guidelines from Director Stanton

22:31.082 --> 22:34.416
that I wanted to go over
with you in this meeting.

22:35.212 --> 22:39.920
OK. Let me just break the ice here.
Lynne, I have invoked executive privilege

22:40.008 --> 22:43.757
and have granted Sherry
a provisional security clearance.

22:43.845 --> 22:47.345
- I see.
- This meeting is about the possibility

22:47.432 --> 22:51.809
of people inside this administration
who may be organising against me.

22:51.895 --> 22:54.184
- Against you?
- David.

22:54.272 --> 23:00.524
Maybe you should bring Lynne up to speed
on where we are with Roger Stanton.

23:10.789 --> 23:14.537
- Mr President?
- Things have been happening too fast today.

23:14.626 --> 23:18.754
Our problems are compounded
by the possibility of a dissenting faction.

23:18.839 --> 23:22.457
- You think Roger might be a part of that?
- It's possible.

23:23.385 --> 23:27.596
If you don't mind my asking, sir,
what led you to this hypothesis?

23:27.681 --> 23:31.050
It troubles me to articulate this, Lynne,

23:31.143 --> 23:36.766
but the ambassador's helicopter accident
solved a lot of Roger Stanton's issues.

23:36.857 --> 23:42.693
- Those issues were shared by many...
- I'm so sorry to interrupt, David.

23:42.779 --> 23:47.655
But there's something else
that you probably don't know, Lynne.

23:47.742 --> 23:50.364
And that is that Roger Stanton

23:50.454 --> 23:54.582
has been having secret meetings
with the minority leader in the Senate,

23:54.666 --> 23:59.375
and Eric Rayburn has been in attendance.

23:59.463 --> 24:03.330
Actually, Sherry,
I am aware of those meetings.

24:04.050 --> 24:06.588
They were trying to forge a bipartisan base

24:06.678 --> 24:11.803
in order to stop questionable allocations
made by the Armed Services Committee.

24:11.892 --> 24:15.936
And, sir, the only reason
I did not brief you on this earlier

24:16.021 --> 24:19.520
is because the vote is not
for another two months.

24:21.026 --> 24:25.106
But I have very detailed records,
if you would like to take a look at them.

24:28.408 --> 24:30.780
This doesn't solve our problems today.

24:30.869 --> 24:36.623
We've got to avert a disaster and we can't do
that if our own people are working against us.

24:36.708 --> 24:42.746
Now, I need to know that Roger Stanton
is supporting this administration.

24:42.839 --> 24:45.330
I'm already working alongside Roger.

24:45.425 --> 24:49.886
Lynne, I'd like you to keep track
of your conversations with him as well.

24:49.971 --> 24:56.140
Now, I've put together a list of people on the
Hill who might be able to help in this matter.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.516
Thank you, Mike.

25:50.282 --> 25:53.283
LA Investigations. Paul Koplin speaking.

25:53.368 --> 25:56.286
Hi. This is Kate Warner.
Is Ralph Burton there?

25:56.371 --> 26:00.665
No. I'm sorry, Kate, Ralph's not here.
Can I help you with something?

26:00.750 --> 26:04.795
- I need to talk to Ralph.
- He left for the day.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.874
He works for me. I'm familiar with the case.
Is there something I can do for you?

26:11.887 --> 26:14.342
I need some help.

26:14.431 --> 26:19.140
I have to get into
my father's private records.

26:24.024 --> 26:26.266
Lynne? Lynne?

26:26.359 --> 26:28.151
- Yes?
- Can I have a sec?

26:28.236 --> 26:30.810
Sure.

26:38.622 --> 26:43.284
I know that you're uncomfortable with me
taking some of these tasks from you.

26:43.376 --> 26:46.580
After all, I'm not officially
on David's staff.

26:46.671 --> 26:51.298
Mrs Palmer, my discomfort has nothing
to do with you being on his staff.

26:51.384 --> 26:54.054
My only concern is to serve the president.

26:54.137 --> 26:57.838
I need to know the people around him
are competent. I don't know you.

26:57.933 --> 27:02.808
You seem like a pretty smart woman,
so let me explain something to you clearly.

27:02.896 --> 27:04.972
Mm.

27:05.065 --> 27:08.149
David did not get here by himself.

27:08.235 --> 27:12.363
He's had competent people
around him his entire life.

27:12.447 --> 27:14.203
Obviously, you're one of them.

27:14.246 --> 27:18.034
Not necessarily the best,
just the most recent.

27:19.354 --> 27:23.915
So have some respect for those of us
who put him into office.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.085
We just might be able to help you.

27:35.095 --> 27:37.337
Fair enough.

27:44.146 --> 27:46.434
Be careful, Sherry.

27:47.274 --> 27:51.437
I need Lynne.
Don't turn this into a competition.

27:51.528 --> 27:53.817
I understand.

27:53.905 --> 28:00.323
I just... need her to know that I'm not
just around here as window-dressing.

28:01.288 --> 28:06.828
- I'm sure she got the message.
- I'll behave. Promise.

28:07.961 --> 28:14.414
Sherry... you don't have
a lot of friends here today.

28:15.635 --> 28:19.087
In fact,
it seems like every time I turn around,

28:19.287 --> 28:21.923
somebody's advising me to send you away.

28:24.686 --> 28:27.224
Then why don't you?

28:27.314 --> 28:31.477
Because you may be able to get
information that nobody else can.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.417
OK, slow down.

28:52.506 --> 28:56.883
As soon as we get a positive ID,
we'll be in within 30 seconds.

28:56.968 --> 28:59.008
- This is it.
- Get out.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.674
Get out!

29:06.019 --> 29:10.930
All teams on alert.
Nina is in play. Nina is in play.

29:11.024 --> 29:14.108
This is team two. We've got her.

29:14.194 --> 29:16.732
Roger that, team two.

29:19.574 --> 29:22.065
Stay on frequency one.

29:43.056 --> 29:45.179
- Michelle, can you read me?
- Copy.

29:45.267 --> 29:49.134
OK, she's in.
We're moving into position now.

29:55.444 --> 29:58.813
Is there something I can help you find?

30:00.824 --> 30:04.109
- I need to see Mamud.
- I'm sorry, I don't know any Mamud.

30:04.202 --> 30:07.156
Tell him Nina is here to see him.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.865
Nina?

30:14.129 --> 30:16.834
Wait here, please.

30:45.076 --> 30:47.235
Go, go, go.

30:50.165 --> 30:52.288
Come with me.

31:02.969 --> 31:07.181
Michelle, I've got static. There's nothing
on my monitor. What's going on?

31:07.265 --> 31:12.260
She's leading her through
a door into a hallway.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.559
Against the wall.

31:17.651 --> 31:19.727
Hands in the air.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.856
They're checking her for weapons.

31:29.663 --> 31:33.032
- What are they saying?
- They thought she was in prison.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.624
Nina said she escaped.

31:44.803 --> 31:50.675
Now they're taking her into another room.
It looks like the one off the east exit.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.093
Who is she talking to?

32:39.293 --> 32:41.936
I can't tell. The
target's still in shadow.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.019
What are they saying?

32:44.112 --> 32:48.739
She said... She's explaining who
she had to pay to escape from prison.

32:48.825 --> 32:53.487
- Jack, should we go?
- Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen.

33:02.798 --> 33:05.086
- My audio went dead.
- I lost mine, too.

33:05.175 --> 33:08.295
- OK, that's it. Everybody go!
- OK, OK.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.494
Stand in position!

33:41.628 --> 33:44.084
Let's go!

33:44.965 --> 33:47.634
Stand in position!

33:52.431 --> 33:55.385
Go, go, go, go!

33:58.353 --> 34:00.595
Phillips! Faheen's unconscious!

34:01.773 --> 34:04.691
She's gone. Nina's gone.
Secure the building.

34:04.776 --> 34:08.062
This is Phillips.
We need medics at the east entrance.

34:38.185 --> 34:41.684
Drop it.

35:53.510 --> 35:58.088
We're leaving LA now, Aunt Carol. We'll
probably be another four or five hours.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.927
OK, we will. Bye.

36:09.151 --> 36:12.733
- Damm it.
- You gotta be kidding.

36:14.114 --> 36:19.155
- Just play it cool.
- Cool? We're in a stolen car.

36:45.145 --> 36:48.395
- Licence and registration?
- Did I do something wrong?

36:48.482 --> 36:51.151
You were speeding.

36:55.614 --> 36:58.401
- Registration, too.
- This is my boss's car.

36:58.492 --> 37:01.528
I'm not sure where he keeps it.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.193
I'm sure it's in here somewhere.

37:05.165 --> 37:09.494
- I think this is it.
- Here you go.

37:16.051 --> 37:18.043
I'll be right back.

37:30.899 --> 37:33.307
- What are you doing?
- Anything else I can do?

37:33.401 --> 37:36.319
- No, Ken. I got it from here.
- Got it.

37:36.404 --> 37:39.109
I'm sorry, John.

37:39.199 --> 37:42.615
Hey, I told you I needed to see you, right?

37:44.412 --> 37:46.868
What happened here?

37:46.957 --> 37:49.412
Never could get you
to watch the news, could I?

37:49.501 --> 37:54.744
If you're looking to bond, having your son
arrested isn't the best way to do that.

37:58.135 --> 38:04.504
I don't have much time, John. Things are
happening here. I can't go into it fully.

38:04.599 --> 38:07.304
- You could never go into anything.
- It's my work.

38:07.394 --> 38:11.605
- Look into it if you start a second family.
- That's not gonna happen.

38:12.691 --> 38:16.060
Look... I understand if you're angry.

38:16.153 --> 38:21.028
I'm not angry, Dad. I don't care.

38:21.116 --> 38:24.816
I really just don't understand.
What are you trying to do here?

38:31.251 --> 38:36.162
I got this bank account.
Nobody knows about it.

38:36.256 --> 38:41.048
It's got a couple hundred thousand
dollars in it. I want you to have it.

38:41.136 --> 38:45.632
The number to my book-keeper, who I've
spoken to. He'll be transferring the money.

38:45.724 --> 38:49.009
You bringing me here to tell me
you're giving me money?

38:49.102 --> 38:54.179
What did you expect me to do? Expect me
to give you a hug? I don't want your money.

38:54.274 --> 38:57.892
Then give it to your mom. I'm sure she does.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.226
Cos thing is,
I'm not going to be needing it.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.687
Why is that?

39:09.664 --> 39:12.072
Why is that, Dad?

39:12.167 --> 39:16.912
You don't bring me here, offer me a small
fortune, then not tell me what's going on.

39:19.174 --> 39:21.332
I'm dying, John.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.751
You son of a bitch.

39:49.287 --> 39:51.957
Is it cancer or something?

39:53.875 --> 39:55.868
Something like that, yeah.

39:59.506 --> 40:05.758
Look, John... something bad
is gonna happen in Los Angeles today.

40:07.055 --> 40:10.305
- And I need you to leave town.
- You want me to leave now?

40:10.392 --> 40:13.559
Go to Phoenix and stay with
your mom for a little while.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.183
I mean it. It's dangerous to be here.

40:18.191 --> 40:22.059
I can't explain it to you,
but you just have to go, OK? Just go.

40:22.154 --> 40:25.902
Dad, listen. I don't... This doesn't matt...

40:25.991 --> 40:27.864
Damm it!

40:33.165 --> 40:36.830
You're a good kid.
I hope I didn't mess you up too bad.

40:36.918 --> 40:39.125
- You all right?
- Yeah.

40:39.212 --> 40:43.210
Get out of here, all right?
Just get out of here, OK?

40:54.352 --> 40:57.306
Oh, God.

40:57.898 --> 41:01.765
The vehicle
is registered to a Gary Matheson.

41:03.278 --> 41:07.323
- We can't let him take us back to LA.
- I know.

41:07.991 --> 41:10.482
Why's he taking so long?

41:25.008 --> 41:27.629
- You say this is your boss's car?
- Yes.

41:30.514 --> 41:33.301
- Who's the little girl?
- I'm her au pair.

41:34.101 --> 41:36.770
- Her what?
- She baby-sits her.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.969
I wasn't talking to you.

41:44.986 --> 41:48.320
I'll tell you what.

41:48.406 --> 41:53.115
I'm gonna let you get off with just a warning
this time. But you slow down, all right?

41:53.995 --> 41:57.614
- Yes, Officer. Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:07.676 --> 42:09.752
Hold up!

42:18.562 --> 42:21.978
You want to step out of the car
and open up the trunk?

42:23.066 --> 42:26.400
Step out of the car and open up the trunk.

42:58.351 --> 43:01.269
Put your hands on your head
and lay on your stomach.

43:01.354 --> 43:03.892
Get down. Get down! Get down.

43:03.982 --> 43:07.185
Get out of the car!
Keep your hands on your head.

43:07.277 --> 43:10.563
- What's going on?
- Lay down on the ground.

43:10.655 --> 43:13.325
Carla! Oh, my God! He killed her!

43:13.408 --> 43:16.445
- What's happening, Kim?
- Megan, get back in the car!

43:16.536 --> 43:19.241
Put your hands behind your head.

43:20.457 --> 43:22.912
Stay there. Cross your legs. Stay still.

Officer in need of assistance.
