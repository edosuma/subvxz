00:02.001 --> 00:04.379
Previously on Lost:

00:17.935 --> 00:20.895
- Who are you?
- We crashed here.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.065
- Flight 815?
- You were in the back?

00:26.193 --> 00:29.570
Back up! Coming out!

00:31.323 --> 00:35.368
Everything is cool, we had a talk and
they believe we were on the plane, too.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.620
Guess we can all sue Oceanic together.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.957
- How many of you survived?
- 23 of us.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.217
I thought you said there were 23 of you?

00:52.469 --> 00:54.637
There were.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.328
It's been four days.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.916
You know, that's not that long.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.335
It could take two weeks
to find a current.

01:26.545 --> 01:30.256
I mean, Michael knew what he was doing.
I doubt anything...

01:32.301 --> 01:36.304
What?

01:39.475 --> 01:45.730
- Sun, what's wrong?
- My wedding ring! It's gone!

04:55.671 --> 04:58.089
Hey, man.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.382
It's OK.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.384
Sun...

05:01.468 --> 05:03.636
You'll be with her again.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.721
Soon.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.140
OK?

05:10.894 --> 05:15.898
Hey. I think they're trying
to figure out what to do with us.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.405
I think they're gonna eat us.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.409
All right, all of you, get up.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.744
We're moving out.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.790
Where?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.876
You're gonna help us get food and water.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.670
What, we work for you now?

05:37.754 --> 05:41.007
You're gonna do it because
we have a long walk ahead of us.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.801
A long walk where?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.262
Back to where you came from.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.877
All clear.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.141
Hey, Mike, I think
we ought to stage a prison break here.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.644
Yeah? Well, I want to figure out
what the hell's going on here

06:35.729 --> 06:38.105
before I make decisions
about anything.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.066
OK, people, listen up.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.236
We need to gather
as much food and water as we can.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.573
We travel in pairs.
You move as fast as you can.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.450
Don't make any noise.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.661
Maybe you could just take a minute
to explain to us

06:52.746 --> 06:57.166
what the hell is going on over here
that's got you all so on edge?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.043
Know what? That's a great idea.

06:59.127 --> 07:03.089
- We can swap stories on the road.
- I'm going to go scout before we move.

07:03.173 --> 07:08.260
- This chick needs to be slapped.
- Cindy, go with him.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.430
Libby, see what fruit you can gather.

07:11.515 --> 07:15.434
- Take him with you.
- His name is Michael.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.687
Yeah. Right. Michael.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.690
- Wait...
- I'll be OK, man, don't worry.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.361
- Bernard and I will gather the fish.
- Fish.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.573
The man knows how to fish.
I'd take him with you if I were you.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.868
Fine. He comes with us too.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.059
Sun.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.312
You OK?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.398
I lost my wedding ring.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.281
When was the last time you saw it?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.953
I'm so used to it, I don't...

08:16.037 --> 08:18.122
I don't know.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.587
I lost my wedding ring once.

08:24.671 --> 08:29.466
It's crazy where you'll look when you
want to find something bad enough.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.011
I went through the...
the garbage outside the house,

08:33.096 --> 08:35.556
emptied the bags and everything.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.308
I even took apart the pipes
in my bathroom

08:38.393 --> 08:42.645
because I was convinced that
it had gone down the drain in the sink.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.815
What did your wife say?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.860
- She never knew.
- How is that?

08:47.944 --> 08:51.822
I went to a jeweler
and I had a replica made, that's how.

08:59.915 --> 09:04.043
Yeah, now it's just rattling around
in my sock drawer back home.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.257
I can help you look.

09:10.342 --> 09:14.136
No. Thanks. I'm sure it will turn up.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.114
Hey! Hey.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.118
You wanna help us out over here?

09:41.164 --> 09:43.290
You wanna eat?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.334
Help us.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.052
Does it look like I speak Korean?

10:18.201 --> 10:20.119
Fish.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.067
- Sorry, Michael.
- Sorry about what?

12:15.151 --> 12:19.738
You know, about... throwing you
and your friends into the pit.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.491
- Friends...
- What?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.744
I never thought about them like that.
One is my friend.

12:25.829 --> 12:29.248
- I'm guessing not the redneck.
- Yeah. Not the redneck.

12:29.332 --> 12:34.253
I don't think I've ever
seen someone so scared in my life.

12:34.337 --> 12:39.049
- And I know about scared.
- That why you threw us in the pit?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.260
Because you're scared?

12:41.344 --> 12:44.471
And we've got... trust issues.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.518
How about that.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.895
Where the hell are all the fruits?

12:51.980 --> 12:56.233
We've picked these trees clean.
Sometimes you find them on the ground.

12:56.317 --> 13:00.237
Why don't you head inland? That's where
all the fruit is on our side.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.157
- We don't go that way.
- Why?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.871
Because that's where they come from.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.718
For your protection when we travel.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.310
You made this?

13:35.732 --> 13:38.066
So what's your name, anyway?

13:42.405 --> 13:47.451
Mr Eko.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.288
Yes.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.165
So, what's that like Mister Ed?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.212
- Michael left.
- What?

13:58.296 --> 14:02.841
He just said something
and he went into the jungle. He's gone.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.844
- Let's go. We're leaving now.
- What do you mean?

14:05.929 --> 14:09.097
- Your buddy ran off into the jungle.
- Michael left.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.311
What's he saying?

14:17.190 --> 14:21.276
Walt!

14:24.822 --> 14:27.950
Let's go, we're moving out now.
Cindy, water?

14:28.034 --> 14:30.619
Libby, can you carry the radio?

14:30.703 --> 14:35.332
Wait, you have a radio?
Does it work? Can you use it?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.876
Wow! What a great idea.

14:37.961 --> 14:42.130
- You gonna slow us down?
- No! Michael.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.050
We're leaving
before he can tell them where we are.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.012
Michael.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.723
What are we supposed to do?
Wait for him?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.059
He ain't comin' back without his kid.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.312
Walt! He ain't comin' back without Walt.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.899
You really think he's gonna find him?

15:03.403 --> 15:07.531
In case you haven't noticed,
it's every man for himself, Chewie.

15:08.116 --> 15:11.326
Mike's gotta worry about Mike,
and I gotta worry about me.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.539
Wait.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.916
Please.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.067
You're going the wrong way.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.821
That's where he is going.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.656
Toward them.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.414
What are you doing?

15:57.498 --> 16:00.459
I am going to help him find his friend.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.212
We can't wait for you.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.883
I don't expect you to.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.604
All you gotta do is retrace your steps.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.066
Like, what did you do yesterday?

16:24.150 --> 16:27.402
I woke up. Washed up.
Walked with Shannon.

16:27.528 --> 16:31.323
We picked some fruit,
cut it up to feed Vincent.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.493
- Then I was... And, uh...
- Whoa. You fed the dog?

16:36.579 --> 16:37.996
Bingo.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.502
So... Seoul.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.922
Is that in the good Korea
or the bad Korea?

16:47.799 --> 16:50.425
The good one.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.225
Did you go to the Olympics?

16:58.309 --> 17:01.311
Hurley, this is ridiculous.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.939
Waiting here for...

17:05.441 --> 17:07.651
The dog did not eat my ring.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.612
Dude, dogs will eat anything.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.365
When I was a kid, my dog Buster...

17:13.449 --> 17:16.117
I had this drawer
where I'd throw in all my change.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.203
I guess there were Smarties in there.

17:18.287 --> 17:22.665
So the next day, Buster craps out
a buck thirty-five in nickels.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.760
Did you ever own a dog?

17:33.845 --> 17:37.723
Yes. Jin gave me one.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.643
- A puppy.
- What was his name?

17:41.728 --> 17:45.772
- Bpo Bpo.
- Bpo Bpo.

17:45.857 --> 17:51.611
- That mean something?
- Yes. It means "a kiss".

17:51.696 --> 17:53.697
A kiss.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.065
- No!
- Michael!

20:34.150 --> 20:36.151
Wait! No!

21:16.025 --> 21:18.568
His name was Goodwin.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.074
Others?

21:42.385 --> 21:44.386
Michael?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.014
No.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.352
For your cut.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.198
So, you're married?

22:06.242 --> 22:08.326
Your ring.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.745
You have a wife?

22:12.081 --> 22:14.082
Yes.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.334
You?

22:17.420 --> 22:18.962
Worse.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.640
Your wife, what is her name?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.520
Her name?

22:35.604 --> 22:38.231
Sun.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.442
She was with you?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.946
On the plane?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.324
Bad day?

23:40.961 --> 23:42.712
It's clean.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.216
Thank you.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.844
You mind if I sit?

23:57.144 --> 23:59.145
Did you see me?

23:59.230 --> 24:01.773
Rip apart your garden? No.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.865
Sometimes I wish
that I had a garden to tear apart.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.037
I don't think
I have ever seen you angry.

24:17.331 --> 24:21.042
Oh, I used to get angry.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.128
All the time.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.338
Frustrated, too.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.674
So you are not frustrated anymore?

24:31.387 --> 24:33.555
I'm not lost anymore.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.976
How did you do that?

24:38.060 --> 24:41.062
Same way anything lost gets found.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.734
I stopped looking.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.428
No, not that way. Over here.

28:06.435 --> 28:10.104
Around here. This is fresh.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.859
His tracks.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.611
Michael?

28:17.863 --> 28:19.989
Yes, Michael.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.243
They don't leave tracks.

28:42.846 --> 28:56.359
Where?

30:23.238 --> 30:26.157
- Michael...
- No.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.367
They don't have him.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.712
They came from that way.

30:39.796 --> 30:43.674
Your friend went that way.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.052
Crossed ahead of them.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.095
Very lucky.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.351
You... go back.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.186
I go.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.563
No.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.857
We go together.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.343
Hey.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.553
Hello.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.557
It's pretty.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.526
Hurley told me
that you lost your wedding ring.

33:09.237 --> 33:15.076
I was just sitting here telling myself
it's silly to be so upset about it.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.206
It is just a thing.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.928
- They've only been gone a few days...
- Don't.

33:34.012 --> 33:38.349
I am sick of everyone saying
he is all right.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.851
He is not all right!

33:43.397 --> 33:46.315
Claire found the bottle.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.777
The one with the messages inside.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.862
The one from the raft.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.746
Where is it?

34:02.040 --> 34:04.250
I buried it.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.320
Stop.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.657
Can I see your water?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.996
Keep slowing us down,

34:42.080 --> 34:44.581
- we'll leave you behind.
- Go ahead.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.333
All right, see ya.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.505
Got a question for you.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.047
Yeah?

34:55.552 --> 35:01.140
Now that your tracker's gone, how are
you gonna find our camp without me?

35:01.224 --> 35:04.810
Walk across the island,
follow the beaches.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.021
And Eko's coming back.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.192
You married?

35:11.318 --> 35:13.319
What?

35:13.403 --> 35:16.071
Are you married?

35:16.198 --> 35:18.115
No.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.202
Too bad, you seem suited for it.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.498
Funny.

35:25.582 --> 35:28.793
- What about you?
- No, ma'am.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.004
- You gay?
- Funny.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.803
Let's go. What are we waitin' for?

36:04.579 --> 36:07.581
Wait here. We lost his trail.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.125
I go back and find it.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.599
What are you doing?

36:27.143 --> 36:29.854
- Go back.
- Michael!

36:29.938 --> 36:31.939
Go back, man!

36:42.075 --> 36:47.955
Walt!

36:48.039 --> 36:50.207
- Michael!
- Look, go away!

36:50.292 --> 36:52.418
I'm not going back without him!

36:52.627 --> 36:55.296
Walt! I'm here!

36:55.422 --> 36:57.214
Where are you, man?

36:57.299 --> 36:59.091
Walt!

36:59.301 --> 37:01.510
You worried they're gonna hear me?

37:01.595 --> 37:03.637
Let them take me!

37:03.722 --> 37:06.223
Come! Come take me!

37:06.308 --> 37:09.393
Shouting is not a good idea.

37:09.477 --> 37:13.731
- You need to come back with us now.
- I'm not leaving him out here!

37:13.815 --> 37:16.567
Stay away from me!

37:20.196 --> 37:23.532
I know they took your son...

37:23.617 --> 37:28.495
...but you have no idea
what these people are capable of.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.332
They will not be found
if they don't want to be.

37:33.335 --> 37:36.921
They took him... right out of my hands.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.798
Right out of my hands!

37:42.177 --> 37:44.803
I'm not going back without him.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.943
You find Walt, Michael.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.437
Can I see it?

38:46.950 --> 38:49.702
Kate, those are private.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.499
Kate, stop.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.418
What are you doing?

39:06.261 --> 39:08.095
We didn't...

39:12.934 --> 39:15.436
I didn't say goodbye.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.607
Sawyer?

39:38.626 --> 39:40.627
Sun...
