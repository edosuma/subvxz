WEBVTT

00:12.250 --> 00:13.500
BELINDA BROWN:
Moving here hasn't been easy.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.417
I just needed to be someplace
your dad wasn't.

00:15.417 --> 00:19.041
Let me make your coffee.
It always makes you feel better.

00:20.125 --> 00:21.083
Oh, Mr. Russell--

00:22.125 --> 00:24.041
(SLURPING)
A bug flew in my mouth.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.750
I want to start doing motocross.
Ray thinks I'll be good at it.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.166
GALE LIPTRAPP: Jealous much?

00:30.375 --> 00:32.041
Can you teach me to ride
this motorcycle?

00:32.041 --> 00:33.917
This the girl we've been hearing
so much about?

00:33.917 --> 00:35.542
-What?
-Shut the fuck up, Ray.

00:35.542 --> 00:36.959
-(ENGINE REVVING)
-(THUDDING)

00:36.959 --> 00:39.041
(MAYA GRUNTING)
You're ruining this for me.

00:39.041 --> 00:41.125
I'm just trying to be a part
of your hobbies.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.792
NEAL: Feelings hopelessness.
It's hard to do it alone.

00:53.917 --> 00:58.000
(eerie music playing)

01:16.125 --> 01:18.583
Todd Frechette,
why are you here?

01:18.583 --> 01:21.125
I'm going to school.
It's teachers' workday.

01:21.125 --> 01:24.375
We did announcements
about it every day this week.
Go home.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.500
But my mom's not home
and the door is locked.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.750
Okay, well, then go bowling
or go play stupid video games

01:29.750 --> 01:32.250
or go masturbate in your car--
whatever it is that
teenage boys do.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.542
You can't be here.

01:33.542 --> 01:36.333
No, no, no--
not "uh, uh, uh." Go home.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.917
Go home. Open this door,
open the next door.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.834
Open the door after that.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.792
But-- I'm walking!
Keep walking.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.375
We need a day
without children!
Okay!

01:45.375 --> 01:48.834
Please!
For the adults, please.
All right!

01:48.834 --> 01:52.333
(theme music playing)

02:00.792 --> 02:02.375
(knocking)

02:05.500 --> 02:07.708
Hey, Ray.
Janelle here?

02:07.708 --> 02:09.667
Yeah, she's getting ready
for her travel race.

02:09.667 --> 02:12.166
Want to come in?
I think it's better
if I stay out here.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.750
Okay.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.834
Janelle?

02:19.834 --> 02:21.917
Dad?

02:21.917 --> 02:25.750
Hey. You look good.
Thanks.

02:25.750 --> 02:28.166
I-- I just stopped by
to drop off some things

02:28.166 --> 02:30.083
that you left
at my place.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.291
This macaroni bracelet
you made.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.708
This sonogram of you
as an embryo.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.208
This decorative ashtray.

02:39.208 --> 02:41.792
It's a key bowl.
Well, whatever it is,

02:41.792 --> 02:43.667
this stuff
is too painful to look at.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.166
Perhaps Ray
will appreciate them.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.917
Dad, all I did was ask you
not to come to motocross
anymore.

02:49.917 --> 02:51.750
You're making
a huge deal out of it.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.750
Actually, no,
you're making a big deal
out of it

02:53.750 --> 02:56.041
because you yelled at me
in front of everyone.

02:56.041 --> 02:57.542
You know what?
I'm gonna go

02:57.542 --> 02:59.250
because I don't want
to get too emotional

02:59.250 --> 03:00.792
and say something
I'm gonna regret.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.792
I understand
you have a race today.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.792
I'd like it
if you'd give me a call,

03:04.792 --> 03:06.041
let me know how you did.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.125
Track conditions.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.583
I believe
you owe me that much.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.667
Have a nice life.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.708
(applause)

03:22.708 --> 03:25.542
Hello, faculty and staff.
Welcome to teacher workday.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.125
Now...
Yay! Belinda Brown!

03:28.125 --> 03:31.291
Y'all raise it up!
Whoo, whoo-whoo!

03:31.291 --> 03:33.250
All right, Mr. Russell.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.834
Now I know we've had
some squabbles recently.

03:35.834 --> 03:38.291
And if my teachers
aren't feeling good,

03:38.291 --> 03:41.208
that means I've messed up
somewhere along the way.

03:41.208 --> 03:44.000
So I'd like for us all
to come together

03:44.000 --> 03:46.375
for some teamwork exercises.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.083
We're all going to meet
in the gym

03:48.083 --> 03:51.583
and we're going to have
some good old-fashioned fun.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.083
(laughs)
And after that,

03:54.083 --> 03:58.959
a catered lunch
from Pogo's Tacos!

03:58.959 --> 04:01.708
Oh, yeah!
I love tacos!

04:01.708 --> 04:04.750
Yay!
(drumbeats)

04:04.750 --> 04:05.959
Belinda:
Yeah!

04:05.959 --> 04:08.792
Save a taco for me,
okay?

04:08.792 --> 04:12.166
Um... (chuckles)
Dr. B?

04:12.166 --> 04:15.291
Java, java, java.
Who wants some?

04:15.291 --> 04:17.458
Already got one.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.750
Oh, Mr. Gamby,
I'd like you to compile

04:19.750 --> 04:21.750
a structural leakage
report today.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.500
And I want you
to take Miss Swift.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.750
You guys need to do
a walkabout, check all
the rooms and the roof.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.417
Fuck this day.
Come on, Swift.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.291
Move your ass.
Let's go.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.834
What is wrong with him?

04:32.834 --> 04:35.166
Oh, I don't know.
Probably some stupid
sports thing.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.875
Hey, I'm-- I'm really
looking forward

04:37.875 --> 04:40.834
to me and you getting
to have some fun times.

04:40.834 --> 04:43.125
Are we just gonna eat
and be bad all day?

04:43.125 --> 04:45.500
I have something else
in mind for you.

04:47.542 --> 04:52.041
Mr. Russell,
these are my sons,
Luke and Mario.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.500
Oh! What strong genes.
Mm!

04:54.500 --> 04:56.458
One of them looks
like Will Smith.

04:56.458 --> 04:59.417
And the other one, he--
well, I bet he's real nice.

04:59.417 --> 05:01.417
Well, you gonna
get to know 'em today, okay?

05:01.417 --> 05:03.208
I need you to stay in here
all day

05:03.208 --> 05:05.083
and keep your eyes
on these two.

05:05.083 --> 05:08.208
Excuse me?
You want me to watch your kids
the entire day?

05:08.208 --> 05:11.708
Well, what--
(laughs)

05:11.708 --> 05:14.583
Well, I don't think
that this really falls
under my job description.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.708
Well, it does today,
Mr. Russell.

05:16.708 --> 05:19.041
And you're gonna be
just fine.

05:19.041 --> 05:22.750
Keep them in this room
and do not let them
out of your sight.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.291
Y'all have fun now!

05:24.291 --> 05:26.834
Oh, I need to-- Belinda?
Bye, Mama.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.125
Uh, Dr. Brown?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.375
I just--
Hey, you smoke weed?

05:31.708 --> 05:34.250
(kids laughing)

05:36.834 --> 05:40.667
All right, Swift,
looks like we got two tiles,
minor water damage.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.041
Write that down.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.208
Next room.
(motor hums)

05:44.208 --> 05:48.792
Knew it.
This pipe is leaking.
Mark it.

05:48.792 --> 05:51.041
Looks like we got
another hole in the dyke.
Mark it, Swift.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.959
Damaged tile, Swift.
Don't look at me weird.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.959
I didn't know
what that meant.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.625
Are you sure?
I-- I--

05:57.625 --> 05:59.583
You are--
Sir--

05:59.583 --> 06:01.792
I'm just kidding.
A dyke holds back water.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.625
And this looks
like one broke, so...

06:03.625 --> 06:06.250
Come on, Swift.
Get in closer, look at it.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.000
Is it buckling?
Um, maybe?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.208
You want to speak a language
or you just want to moan

06:10.208 --> 06:12.458
and groan at the top
of the ladder?
I can't really tell.

06:12.458 --> 06:14.333
Gamby:
Is it damaged
or is it not?

06:14.333 --> 06:16.083
Enough of the noises.
I don't like the grunting.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.291
It's making me
feel uncomfortable.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.792
Get down from there right now.
Come on.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.041
There's a water-filtration
problem on hall D.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.959
Go check that out.
Turn my flashlight off.
You're wasting the batteries.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.000
You're actually doing work
on teacher workday?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.458
What a loser.
I hate today.
There's no kids here to bust.

06:28.458 --> 06:31.166
I mean, what the hell
am I even doing here?
It sucks.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.625
Are you doing okay?
(snorts) Fine.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.333
I've gotten over my daughter.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.000
Over her?
Yes, I've moved on.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.542
Okay.
Ray won her.
So conversation over.

06:39.542 --> 06:42.250
Well, they say that food
is good for the soul.

06:42.250 --> 06:46.125
And I am starving.
Do you want to whip me up
some breakfast?

06:46.125 --> 06:50.291
I mean,
the kitchen's all locked up.
The big door is shut.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.166
And what are these for?
Hmm?

06:53.166 --> 06:55.375
Ow!
Sorry.

06:55.375 --> 06:58.291
You are in
for a treat today.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.417
Got my famous Gamby
breakfast scramble
going here.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.834
My daughter loves this.

07:02.834 --> 07:06.959
Well, loved it.
She's not going to be eating
too much of this anymore.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.000
Hmm!
Too bad, so sad.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.583
I want to help.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.667
You want to help?

07:11.667 --> 07:13.583
Yeah. Show me.
Okay.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.959
Um, well, there's
not really much to do.
We're just kind of like--

07:15.959 --> 07:18.500
Take the handle?
Yeah, move the whisk around.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.875
Okay, like that?
Just try to keep it
slow and even

07:21.875 --> 07:25.375
just so it doesn't stick
to the bottom of the frying pan.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.333
Okay.
Yeah, just...

07:45.708 --> 07:48.625
Whoa, look.
It's, uh, sticking here.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.917
Let it get away from us
there for a moment.
Yeah.

07:50.917 --> 07:55.333
You want to get the plates
for us to eat it on?

07:55.333 --> 07:57.542
Yes. Okay.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.125
Well, that was good.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.208
Yeah, I'm pretty stuffed.
I guess I'll see you

08:06.208 --> 08:09.166
at the team-building thing,
huh?
Okay, yeah.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.417
See ya.
Yeah.

08:10.417 --> 08:12.750
I'll take it.
Yeah, bye.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.333
Cool.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.125
Large black male.

08:32.208 --> 08:35.500
(rattling machines)

08:35.500 --> 08:39.250
No. No, sir!
Hands out of that
vending machine right now.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.083
Drop the snacks right there.
Who the hell are you?

08:42.083 --> 08:43.583
What are you doing here?

08:45.041 --> 08:47.959
Shit! Shit!
Get back here!

08:49.834 --> 08:51.792
Come back here!
Son of a bitch!

08:51.792 --> 08:55.166
(both grunting)

08:55.166 --> 08:58.083
Submit to me!
Submit to me! Who are you?
Okay, okay!

08:58.083 --> 09:00.917
Okay, man!
What are you doing here?

09:00.917 --> 09:03.959
Dascious?
You know this man, Dr. Brown?

09:03.959 --> 09:06.625
I'm her husband, man!
Ex-husband.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.458
That may be son,
but I ain't an ex-father.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.792
I got a right
to see my boys.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.333
I caught him trespassing
in the hallway.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.000
He was stealing food
out of the vending machines.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.542
They was-- they was
hanging down, cookies.

09:14.542 --> 09:15.875
They was paid for already.

09:15.875 --> 09:18.041
Exactly why
I had to leave your behind.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.875
You're just a bad influence.
They're my boys too.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.291
You can't keep me
from hugging my own sons.

09:23.291 --> 09:26.417
Please, Belinda,
I need them.

09:28.333 --> 09:32.208
Mr. Gamby,
take this broke-ass
motherfucker out to the street.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.041
You heard her. Let's go.
Okay.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.834
Broke-ass motherfucker?
All right!
Come on!

09:35.834 --> 09:37.417
I want to see
my damn boys!

09:37.417 --> 09:40.125
Get out of here!
(Dascious screaming)

09:41.458 --> 09:44.083
Look at his jeans.
(chuckles)

09:44.083 --> 09:46.834
Uh, yes, look at my jeans.

09:46.834 --> 09:50.291
You wish you could afford 'em.
They're 7 for All Mankind.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.750
So why are you gay?

09:51.750 --> 09:54.542
I'm not.
(both laughing)

09:54.542 --> 09:58.041
Oh, okay.
Well, look at this.

09:58.041 --> 10:01.000
That's a picture of me
and my wife

10:01.000 --> 10:04.458
on a picnic yesterday--
blue skies.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.625
She Chinese.
She's Korean.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.125
I'm gonna be a famous singer.
Uh, you're not
leaving this room.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.208
You're not--
you're not leaving this room.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.000
Hey, hey, stop.
Give me that.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.583

Huh? You call him again,
I'm gonna beat both
y'all asses!

10:42.834 --> 10:45.708
Belinda? Can I just
have a word with you?

10:45.708 --> 10:47.959
I have to ask--
I'm really detecting

10:47.959 --> 10:49.917
all these very aggressive
vibes from you.

10:49.917 --> 10:53.583
I told you to keep them
in that office for a reason.

10:53.583 --> 10:55.250
Now if I find them
out of that office again,

10:55.250 --> 10:57.750
you might find yourself
out of this office.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.875
And what the hell
you grinning about?

10:59.875 --> 11:02.375
Take your narrow ass
back in that office!

11:02.375 --> 11:04.291
Only "nut" you know about
is Planters.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.667
Coming in here,
you talkin' crazy!
Now--

11:07.667 --> 11:09.792
Kipnis:
In a moment,
I'll pass out these cards.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.875
You will place the card
upon your forehead

11:11.875 --> 11:14.625
and then ask your partner
yes-or-no questions only

11:14.625 --> 11:17.417
to try to guess
the occupation.

11:17.417 --> 11:20.417
This is about improving
our communications skills.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.542
Now partner up!

11:23.834 --> 11:27.208
Dibs on Gamby!
(guffawing)

11:27.208 --> 11:29.917
Oh, actually,
I was going to be partners
with Miss Snodgrass.

11:29.917 --> 11:32.375
Too late.
Got your hand.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.959
Stop.
(whistle blowing)

11:35.959 --> 11:37.750
Seychelles:
Is it a stressful job?

11:37.750 --> 11:40.458
It's definitely
the hardest job in the world.

11:40.458 --> 11:44.375
Wardrobe mistress
for "Kinky Boots"
on Broadway.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.083
Do I work long hours?
You're obsessed
with your job.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.667
(snorts)
Okay, um...

11:49.667 --> 11:51.125
What's going on
with you and Gamby?

11:51.125 --> 11:52.750
You guys aren't, like,
a thing, right?

11:52.750 --> 11:54.750
None of your business.
Seriously?

11:54.750 --> 11:57.667
Neal Gamby?
So what's the deal?

11:57.667 --> 12:01.000
Is Amanda your girlfriend now?
Why don't you just butt out?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.417
I'm just wondering
if your little binder
actually worked.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.000
I told you not to say
anything about that.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.959
And why don't you just
mind your own business,
all right?

12:06.959 --> 12:08.834
Do you want to cheat on her?
Can we just play the game?

12:08.834 --> 12:10.834
Can we play the stupid game
and guess this thing?

12:10.834 --> 12:12.792
Uh... (laughs) Um...

12:12.792 --> 12:16.000
Do people want to see me?
(laughs)

12:16.000 --> 12:17.500
A chef?
No.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.708
Astronaut?
No.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.750
Nanny?
Why have you shut me out?

12:20.750 --> 12:21.875
Traffic warden?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.959
Am I helping people
in some way?

12:23.959 --> 12:27.375
No. You're a greedy jerk.
You only care about yourself.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.959
You like it when I fucked you?
That's not anything to do--

12:29.959 --> 12:33.792
This is about this job.
I'm asking, do you like
when this person fucks you?

12:33.792 --> 12:35.458
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.792
Am I making enough money
to support my family?

12:37.792 --> 12:40.291
Yes.
But you feel empty inside,

12:40.291 --> 12:42.667
like your life's work
is meaningless.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.834
What the fuck you say?

12:47.417 --> 12:49.417
Excuse me.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.166
Is my job someone
who cares about you deeply?

12:51.166 --> 12:54.208
No.
Did you ever have feelings
for this job?

12:54.208 --> 12:55.750
No.
Wife?

12:55.750 --> 12:57.542
No way in hell is it a wife.

12:57.542 --> 12:59.208
Lover?
Nope. Nothing.

12:59.208 --> 13:02.834
Best friend?
You're a truck driver.

13:02.834 --> 13:06.166
You're a dirty truck driver.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.708
Don't spin him!
What are you doing?

13:07.708 --> 13:09.500
Don't spin him right now!
Will you stop?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.708
You're gonna be drunk.
You're gonna get out
of this thing

13:11.708 --> 13:14.166
and you're gonna throw up.
Will you please just stop it?

13:16.542 --> 13:17.708
Ow!

13:17.708 --> 13:21.375
How are things going
with Mario and Luigi?

13:21.375 --> 13:23.375
It fuckin' sucks,
is how it's going.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.875
But that's okay.
I'm gonna turn it
into a positive.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.917
I'm gonna ply
their feeble minds for
information about Big Mama.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.041
The ultimate betrayal.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.583
Why do you keep
checking your phone?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.333
Ain't nobody fuckin'
calling you.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.375
Checking to see if my daughter
texted me about her race,

13:40.375 --> 13:42.959
but of course she didn't
because she doesn't care
about me anymore.

13:42.959 --> 13:45.041
I just hate teacher workdays,
to tell you the truth.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.125
I just get all emotionally
fucked up in my own head.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.875
There's nobody here
except for the teachers.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.542
I just feel like
they're always looking at me
like they're better than me.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.917
Especially Abbot and Hayden.
They do it the fuckin' most.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.083
Hayden?
That recycling cunt?

13:56.083 --> 13:57.917
He wears clothes
from Structure.

13:57.917 --> 14:00.458
And Abbot's
just a bipolar bitch.
Fuck them.

14:00.458 --> 14:03.000
I wish I could.
See, those were good insults
about them.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.750
I can't come up
with stuff like that.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.125
That's not my forte.
That's yours.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.750
You want me to tell you
the easiest way to go?

14:07.750 --> 14:09.166
Yes.
The throat, just like this.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.583
What?
Look for the face.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.417
Hey, you got bad-ass
fuckin' ears.

14:12.417 --> 14:14.000
Hey, look at
your dumb-ass nose.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.667
Or in your case,
like a fuckin' moustache.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.625
You know, sometimes I go
with you with the moustache?

14:17.625 --> 14:19.750
It's all right here.
Yeah, just don't do that thing

14:19.750 --> 14:22.708
where you repeat
a person's insult
back at them.

14:22.708 --> 14:25.041
That's just the worst.
And you do that all the time.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.250
No, I don't.
You do that.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.917
Just like that.
See that?

14:27.917 --> 14:29.834
That's what you just did.
Don't be that person.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.458
Don't be you, Gamby.
Got it.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.083
Hey, Neal,
you want to come sit
next to me?

14:39.083 --> 14:41.250
Yeah.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.792
Thanks for saving me a seat
at the cool kids' table, huh?

14:43.792 --> 14:46.250
Amanda, why don't you
just sit in his lap?

14:46.250 --> 14:48.291
Don't be a dick, Bill.

14:48.291 --> 14:50.625
Oh, I'm a dick?
'Cause as I recall,

14:50.625 --> 14:52.125
I read your book
and did edits on it.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.667
So I guess
that makes me a dick now.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.000
Book?
Don't, no.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.917
Amanda wrote a kids' book.

14:56.917 --> 15:00.166
No, I wrote a YA novel,
not a kids' book.
Actually...

15:00.166 --> 15:02.667
It's called
"Cassiopeia Falling"
or some shit.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.375
It's about a dude
that fucks dragons.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.333
What?
I'll be skipping that one.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.667
(imitates laugh)
What's so funny about that,
Abbot?

15:10.667 --> 15:12.458
You don't even know
what the story's about.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.792
Maybe it's not crazy.
Maybe it's, like,
a cool story.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.458
A guy who fucks dragons?
That's crazy.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.500
It's more like bestiality.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.667
Yeah, looks like
something you're into
with that shirt you wore.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.208
How many fuckin' zebras
did you have to fuck
to get that on?

15:23.208 --> 15:25.166
For your information,
I got this at Nordstrom.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.458
I didn't fuck
any zebras.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.542
Pssh! Nordstrom Rack.
No, real Nordstrom.

15:28.542 --> 15:31.667
It's like I've always
imagined what a horse
would look like when it talks,

15:31.667 --> 15:33.125
and now I know.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.166
Why don't you guys stop
trying to bully Miss Snodgrass?

15:35.166 --> 15:37.208
She wrote a book.
That's a pretty cool thing
to do.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.834
It's probably more
than you nerds have done.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.250
Hey, we're just
having a good time.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.750
It was mean, Bill.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.792
Don't let these idiots
get into your head, all right?

15:43.792 --> 15:45.083
Both these two fuckers.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.834
(phone ringing)

15:46.834 --> 15:50.375
Hold up for a second.
Hello?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.458
(on phone)
Janelle? Hello?

15:52.458 --> 15:53.834
Neal?

15:53.834 --> 15:55.834
Hey, sorry,
I have Janelle's phone.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.625
I must have butt-dialed you
on accident.

15:57.625 --> 15:58.917
Are you guys at the race?

15:58.917 --> 16:00.417
Yes! Janelle made
the final heat!

16:00.417 --> 16:02.417
Big whoop.
I know you just called
to make me sad,

16:02.417 --> 16:04.959
but guess what? Fuck you.
Because I'm not sad.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.041
It's the best teacher workday
I've ever had before

16:07.041 --> 16:09.041
and everyone's laughing
at my jokes. So there.
Gale: Okay.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.041
Enough.
Listen, Neal, I gotta--

16:11.041 --> 16:13.375
If you'll excuse me.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.792
Neal.
Awkward!

16:15.792 --> 16:17.417
Oh, shut up, horse face.

16:24.750 --> 16:25.750
Dr. Brown?

16:25.750 --> 16:27.417
Hello, Mr. Gamby.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.834
Did you follow me here?

16:28.834 --> 16:32.000
No, I was just--
just doing a patrol of--

16:32.000 --> 16:34.417
I just needed
a place to think.

16:34.417 --> 16:37.792
Looks like this is where
the kids come to smoke.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.083
Figures.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.542
I couldn't control
my own family.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.542
Why would I be able
to control my school?

16:44.542 --> 16:47.041
Are you upset
about that black gentleman?

16:47.041 --> 16:49.250
He's a lying,
cheatin' piece of shit.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.375
Never should have
married that man.

16:53.417 --> 16:54.708
What happened with you two?

16:54.708 --> 16:57.917
I caught his ass,
butt-naked in the bed

16:57.917 --> 17:00.417
with a dancer
from Club Risqué.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.708
My son saw the whole thing.

17:02.708 --> 17:06.125
Their daddy pulling out
of this nasty-ass ho.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.458
Dick all big and wet,

17:08.458 --> 17:11.417
like a damn
French-dip sandwich.

17:11.417 --> 17:14.083
I knew I had to get my boys
out of that town.

17:14.083 --> 17:18.583
But he just won't quit
trying to get his kids back.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.041
Well, that--
that I can understand.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.917
Oh, you defendin'
his lying ass now?

17:23.917 --> 17:27.792
No, I'm not.
I'm just speaking
from personal experience.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.875
(sighs)
I lost a child of my own.

17:29.875 --> 17:33.458
Oh, Mr. Gamby.
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know that.

17:33.458 --> 17:36.250
My daughter, she--

17:36.250 --> 17:38.458
she recently
had enough of me

17:38.458 --> 17:40.458
and decided
that she would swap me out

17:40.458 --> 17:42.959
for a dad
that she likes better.

17:42.959 --> 17:45.250
I try to put on
a tough exterior,

17:45.250 --> 17:48.375
but all I can do
is just think about her

17:48.375 --> 17:50.792
and how
she doesn't love me anymore.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.291
I am so sorry, Mr. Gamby.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.959
It's all right.
It's not your fault.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.583
You know,
you got your boys.

17:59.583 --> 18:03.458
So compared to Dascious,
you didn't do too bad.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.208
I appreciate
you saying that.

18:07.208 --> 18:10.166
I'm there for you.
Okay?

18:16.041 --> 18:18.250
Y'all ever seen
real pussies before?

18:18.250 --> 18:20.375
Mm-hmm.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.834
Hmm.

18:22.834 --> 18:26.500
Ooh. Mmm.

18:30.166 --> 18:32.208
Not so gay now, am I?

18:32.208 --> 18:34.083
This will be
our dirty little secret.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.166
Y'all know
how to keep secrets, right?

18:36.166 --> 18:39.291
Yeah.
Good.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.834
Good. Me too.
I know how to keep secrets--

18:40.834 --> 18:42.959
all kinds of secrets.
Like, dark secrets.

18:42.959 --> 18:46.792
Maybe there's some secrets
y'all want to share with me?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.125
Like what?

18:48.125 --> 18:49.792
Oh, I don't know.
Like...

18:49.792 --> 18:51.458
what's mama like at home?

18:51.458 --> 18:54.041
Does she ever do
any fucked-up shit

18:54.041 --> 18:56.000
or anything at home,
maybe sometimes?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.417
She fuck Luke.

18:58.417 --> 19:01.000
Really? Are you serious?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.750
She fucked us both.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.375
I want you
to tell me everything.

19:04.375 --> 19:07.500
I need to know
every single thing
that has happened to you two.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.208
Can we go
to the vending machine
and get snacks first?

19:10.208 --> 19:11.959
(sighs)

19:11.959 --> 19:14.291
Well, I'm really not supposed
to let you leave this room.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.500
But I will go get you
whatever it is that you want

19:17.500 --> 19:19.083
as long as when I come back,

19:19.083 --> 19:22.458
you tell me all
of your dirty little secrets.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.583
Deal.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.500
Deal!

19:25.500 --> 19:29.750
(door opens, closes)

19:31.917 --> 19:34.083
Hey.
Oh, Miss Snodgrass.

19:34.083 --> 19:36.834
You heading
to the closing ceremony?
Yep.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.542
Are you okay?
You ran off.

19:38.542 --> 19:41.500
Yeah, I'm fine.
I mean, the real question is,
are you okay?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.417
Hayden came at you
pretty hard.

19:43.417 --> 19:44.875
He's an asshole.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.250
His opinions
are pretty stupid too.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.875
I mean, I for one
would love to read your book.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.083
Uh, no, you don't.
It sucks.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.041
Come on, you let Hayden
read it and give edits,
you won't let me?

19:53.041 --> 19:55.291
I write two memos a day
and this guy teaches history.

19:55.291 --> 19:58.542
Right?
I know you're crazy.

19:58.542 --> 20:01.083
God damn it!
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:01.083 --> 20:02.458
You know Brown
doesn't want to see you.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.583
I know, I know, but...
you seen a little wallet?

20:04.583 --> 20:06.000
No, I haven't seen
a goddamn wallet.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.875
I must have lost it
while you was chasing my ass.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.959
All right, all right.
Here it is right here!

20:10.959 --> 20:14.333
Okay, snack attack!
Who's hungry?

20:16.083 --> 20:17.125
Oh!

20:18.959 --> 20:21.625
Get back here!
Oh, shit!

20:26.333 --> 20:28.125
Ah!

20:32.250 --> 20:34.625
Get back here!

20:46.792 --> 20:50.333
Oh, sweet.
Check this shit out.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.208
(gasps)

20:54.291 --> 20:55.708
Get back here, man!

20:55.708 --> 20:58.500
Get back here!
Oh, shit!

21:01.000 --> 21:04.333
See, we should definitely
be high while doin' this shit.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.625
Oh, shit, don't move.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.917
(grunting)
Fuck you, man!

21:19.917 --> 21:22.250
The auditorium. Go!
What? Oh, God.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.333
Belinda:
Teaching can feel
like a solo job

21:24.333 --> 21:27.000
because it's just you
in the classroom,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.792
holding it down.
But we can use teamwork--

21:29.792 --> 21:32.834
Dascious:
Hey, hey, hey,
stop the proceeding!

21:32.834 --> 21:34.750
Dascious?
Get the fuck out of there!

21:34.750 --> 21:36.333
Dascious is here!
Into the school.

21:36.333 --> 21:39.417
Dascious:
Just-- just let me say
one thing.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.625
Um, Belinda,

21:41.625 --> 21:45.291
I know-- I know
that I fucked up in the past.

21:45.291 --> 21:48.375
Bad.
Fact is...

21:49.917 --> 21:52.208
I failed you
as a husband

21:52.208 --> 21:54.083
and for that,
I'm sorry.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.208
I'll never
forgive myself.

21:56.208 --> 22:00.708
But please--
please don't let me
fail my boys.

22:05.125 --> 22:08.166
Oh, real nice! Getting high
on school grounds!

22:08.166 --> 22:10.250
Only reason
I'm not expelling you two

22:10.250 --> 22:12.041
is 'cause y'all
don't go to school here.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.542
You lied to me!
Mm-hmm.

22:13.542 --> 22:15.917
Now let's go.
Come down right this second.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.166
We'll come down
if you smoke this.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.583
(grunts)
Come on.

22:20.583 --> 22:23.166
Come on, come on.

22:23.166 --> 22:25.959
Just throw-- just--
will you throw it down,
please?

22:25.959 --> 22:27.583
Throw it down.
Okay.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.291
(coughing)

22:32.291 --> 22:34.542
Okay, all right,
I'm high now.

22:34.542 --> 22:36.542
Does that make you
feel good?

22:36.542 --> 22:39.375
Now come down.
Your mom's gonna be
in her office any minute.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.917
$100.

22:40.917 --> 22:42.917
(sighs)

22:42.917 --> 22:44.250
$8.
$100.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.625
I'll give you $16
and that's it.

22:46.625 --> 22:49.083
$100.
Okay, $19.50,

22:49.083 --> 22:51.542
and that's my last
and final offer ever.

22:51.542 --> 22:55.750
$100.
I'm still thinking $100.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.083
Fuck!

22:57.083 --> 22:59.458
I want to believe you,
Dascious, I do.

22:59.458 --> 23:01.959
But-- but those boys
can't unsee what they saw.

23:01.959 --> 23:03.959
(whispering)
They saw his dick.

23:03.959 --> 23:06.125
Belinda:
You remember how they cried?
Wow.

23:07.125 --> 23:09.166
Belinda:
But I know a man
needs his kids.

23:10.291 --> 23:12.333
And I suppose
they need you too.

23:14.959 --> 23:18.166
You cannot come back
and live with us,

23:18.166 --> 23:23.375
but I can't control who stays
at the Aristocrat Inn.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.750
You for real?

23:26.625 --> 23:28.792
I am.

23:28.792 --> 23:31.583
Now, fool,
get out of that booth
so we can go get our boys.

23:31.583 --> 23:34.333
Ha! Whoo!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.625
(muttering)

23:41.792 --> 23:45.834
Lee, you better get those kids
wrangled up.

23:45.834 --> 23:47.667
(on radio)
Mama Bear is on her way
back to the den.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.291
Fuck. Right now?
Gamby:
Yes, now.

23:49.291 --> 23:51.208
Where are you?
My God, move, move, move!

23:51.208 --> 23:53.083
I'm coming.
Faster than that!
Faster than that!

23:53.083 --> 23:56.166
Let's go. What are you doing?
I'm high as a motherfucker.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.875
Your mother is on her way
back to the office right now.

23:58.875 --> 24:01.583
And if we're
not sitting in that office
when she gets there,

24:01.583 --> 24:03.708
she's gonna beat
all of our asses black.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.125
So move! Get up!
Shit, come on.

24:06.125 --> 24:07.542
Big Mama's coming!

24:07.542 --> 24:09.625
Okay, all right.
No...

24:09.625 --> 24:11.333
We can hold hands
or something.
No.

24:11.333 --> 24:14.166
Hold on, I need
a little refreshment.

24:15.166 --> 24:16.333
(water running)

24:16.333 --> 24:19.166
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.250
(all grunting)

24:26.250 --> 24:29.875
Oh, shit.
Refreshing as hell.

24:31.041 --> 24:31.959
Whew!

24:31.959 --> 24:35.250
Huh!
Gotta come up for air.

24:51.375 --> 24:53.291
Actually, you know...
This way!

24:53.291 --> 24:54.917
We never showed Dascious
the music hall.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.458
Maybe he wants
to check that out real quick.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.208
No, we can skip things.
Dascious?

25:07.750 --> 25:10.875
Go! What are
you waiting for? Go! Fly!

25:15.500 --> 25:18.041
This way,
you stupid piece of shit.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.208
Faster!
God! You're going on a diet
after this.

25:29.458 --> 25:33.750
"And at that very moment,
Pinocchio awoke

25:33.750 --> 25:36.708
and opened wide
his eyes."

25:38.875 --> 25:41.583
Boys?
Oh, hey, B.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.625
Someone's here to see you.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.375
Boys, you got a hug
for your daddy?

25:46.375 --> 25:49.583
Come here! Hey!

25:49.583 --> 25:51.750
Oh, let me look at you!

25:51.750 --> 25:53.875
I really appreciated
our talk.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.458
Yeah, me too.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.834
Hold up, Russell.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.500
How did it go?

26:03.500 --> 26:06.000
Good. No problems
whatsoever.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Your boys,
they're a dream.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.125
You a lyin' sack of shit.
(laughs)

26:17.375 --> 26:20.291
Come on, come on!

26:25.417 --> 26:28.667
(door opens)
Snodgrass:
Oh, here you are!

26:28.667 --> 26:30.291
I've been looking
all over for you.

26:30.291 --> 26:32.750
Oh, hey.
Yeah, I was just up here
finishing up this shit.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.708
What's that?

26:34.708 --> 26:37.500
Uh, it's my book.
I thought maybe you might--
you could read it.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, I'd love to.
I'm flattered.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.834
Just remember,
it's still really rough.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.792
I mean, all the stuff
with King Olgar

26:43.792 --> 26:46.417
and Favian the Huntsman
needs to be fleshed out
a bit better.

26:46.417 --> 26:48.917
But, I don't know,
I think you might like
Bluffin the Wizard.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.667
Bluffin the Wizard?
Sounds fascinating.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.291
Just so you know,
I'm kind of a slow reader,

26:53.291 --> 26:55.125
so if this takes me
a while to read it,

26:55.125 --> 26:56.583
I hope you don't
get offended or anything.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.125
Oh, take your time.
No rush.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.417
Yeah.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.083
You know,
on a personal note,

27:01.083 --> 27:03.667
I just want you to know
that I just think

27:03.667 --> 27:08.041
that you're a multi-talented,
very terrific--

27:20.083 --> 27:22.375
I'm gonna
put your book down, okay?

27:22.375 --> 27:23.542
Oh. Yeah.

27:26.708 --> 27:31.041
Look at this fuck machine,
all smilin'.

27:31.041 --> 27:32.834
Yeah, did me good.

27:32.834 --> 27:35.500
This wasn't a bad
teacher workday after all,
was it?

27:35.500 --> 27:36.875
(phone ringing)
Nope.

27:36.875 --> 27:38.417
